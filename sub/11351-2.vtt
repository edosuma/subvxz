00:44.076 --> 00:46.127
Picking up a very strange signal.

00:51.590 --> 00:52.938
What just happened?

00:54.036 --> 00:56.750
Losing electrical power.
Something's interfering with the systems.

00:56.870 --> 00:58.123
****

00:58.243 --> 01:00.944
Sir, I have an unidentified
sonar reading,

01:01.064 --> 01:04.288
bearing 20, designate Sierra 155

01:08.628 --> 01:11.284
It's some sort of...  animal.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.321
Can't be **** affecting systems.

01:14.105 --> 01:17.614
Sir, it's big and whatever it is it's
coming straight for us.

01:17.734 --> 01:20.780
Sound the collision alarm.
Blow all tanks! Take her up!

01:23.700 --> 01:26.480
Helmsman, give me full tilt.

==Transcribed by <font color=#00ff00>dcdah</font>==
for www.addic7ed.com

02:21.740 --> 02:24.438
I logged into Prospros property
portfolio.

02:25.942 --> 02:26.616
And?

02:26.736 --> 02:29.341
Last year Philip bought a
de-commsioned power station.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.805
Tell me what that's about.

02:36.961 --> 02:38.034
Can we talk to Connor?

02:38.154 --> 02:39.631
Ahh.... I don't think we
can risk that.

02:39.751 --> 02:42.906
If he knew Helen was in any way with Philip,
he'd have nothing more to do with him.

02:43.026 --> 02:44.887
You're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

02:45.007 --> 02:46.057
Like you did with Emily?

02:51.736 --> 02:53.429
Emily was a low blow, sorry.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.543
Forget about it.

02:54.663 --> 02:55.534
Matt,

02:55.654 --> 02:57.280
I did some research.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.427
- I found out what happened to her.
- Abby!

03:00.308 --> 03:01.657
I don't want to know.

03:01.777 --> 03:04.354
Emily made her way home and
that's all that matters, ok?

03:25.021 --> 03:25.465
Hey.

03:25.585 --> 03:25.961
Hey.

03:26.305 --> 03:29.354
I just have to finish something
here, quickly.

03:29.474 --> 03:30.386
What you working on?

03:30.506 --> 03:32.038
I thought the date and calculations
were all signed off.

03:32.158 --> 03:35.588
Oh, this is um....
this is.....

03:38.450 --> 03:39.538
One of those things,

03:39.658 --> 03:40.970
I can't talk about.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.497
- Oh!
- Sorry.

03:42.617 --> 03:45.456
It's just...
It's gonna be good though.

03:47.850 --> 03:49.405
You are coming out with the team
though, right?

03:49.525 --> 03:52.163
Yeah, of course. This is part
of me job too.

03:52.283 --> 03:53.925
No Connor, this is your <i>other</i> job.

03:54.888 --> 03:56.939
Matt and I have had to cover
for you lately.

03:57.716 --> 03:59.725
People are starting to notice.

04:02.946 --> 04:04.955
Do you know what?
Your right.

04:05.189 --> 04:07.707
I'm sorry, my bad.
Okay.

04:08.283 --> 04:09.796
Just gonna...

04:16.072 --> 04:18.122
No running in the corridors!

04:18.622 --> 04:23.301
56:21.9, 2:48.8

04:24.581 --> 04:25.544
That's a new one.

04:25.664 --> 04:27.016
That's the middle of the
North Sea.

04:30.550 --> 04:32.160
Jess speaking.

04:33.935 --> 04:36.756
It's for you, it's the Admiralty.

04:41.747 --> 04:43.192
Lester.

04:47.916 --> 04:50.957
There was a marine animal caught
up on the bridge when we surfaced.

04:51.260 --> 04:52.870
Could that have been what
attacked your boat?

04:52.990 --> 04:53.998
Too small.

04:54.518 --> 04:56.541
It's not like any creature
I've seen before.

04:56.661 --> 04:57.779
So where's the body now?

04:57.899 --> 04:58.646
On board.

04:59.802 --> 05:01.839
I'm <i>not</i> happy about this.

05:02.664 --> 05:05.417
Captain, we've both got our jobs to do,
so let's just get ahead and do them, yeah?

05:05.537 --> 05:10.083
And I don't get how <I>specialist your weapons
are, there're not coming on board my boat.

05:10.317 --> 05:12.932
If there's a need for firearms we
have a more than adequate armory.

05:13.052 --> 05:15.629
This is all scientific equipment,
there's no weapons here.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.340
Feel free to make an inspection
if you want.

05:19.679 --> 05:21.000
That won't be necessary.

05:22.748 --> 05:25.624
There, an **** class electrical-
diesel boat.

05:26.692 --> 05:27.696
How'd you know that?

05:28.164 --> 05:31.329
I read....
I watch all the movies don't I?

05:31.687 --> 05:32.650
"Das Boat".

05:33.132 --> 05:34.962
"K-19, The Widow Maker".

05:35.513 --> 05:36.889
You know, death by drowning,

05:38.193 --> 05:40.671
suffocation, radiation poisoning.

05:42.607 --> 05:43.409
Gentlemen.

05:43.529 --> 05:44.221
Sir.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.489
Thank you Shaw.

05:53.429 --> 05:55.383
He's a great little asset ****.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.938
As good as the Trafarlgar class for
sensors and armament.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.159
I thought we'd sold them all off.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.374
No, no, we keep a couple for
training exercises.

06:04.746 --> 06:06.191
You know your submarines?

06:06.769 --> 06:09.838
I was in the Royal Marines.
Spent a bit of time underwater.

06:09.958 --> 06:11.402
You were army.

06:12.228 --> 06:14.072
The navy would have been my
first choice.

06:15.517 --> 06:18.131
Take her away gentlemen,
forward 1/3.

06:18.251 --> 06:19.205
Aye Captain.

06:19.617 --> 06:20.347
Sir.

06:21.847 --> 06:23.829
- Give me 10 degrees plane.
- Aye Captain.

06:26.388 --> 06:27.434
Connor.

06:28.452 --> 06:29.127
Yes.

06:33.021 --> 06:33.957
Hey.

06:38.353 --> 06:40.720
Can I just uh... Can I ask
a quick question?

06:40.840 --> 06:44.174
Do you get seasick on submarines cause...
I've really got a tendency to uh...

06:44.560 --> 06:46.830
Only on the surface.

06:47.138 --> 06:49.574
Underwater there's little sensation
of movement.

06:49.694 --> 06:51.460
- That's good.
- Yeah.

06:51.580 --> 06:52.602
Good thing.

06:53.372 --> 06:58.057
This is Midshipman Leonard, my sonar
officer, Officer Neal, and Officer Shaw.

06:59.323 --> 07:01.979
Whatever you're here to do has
been classified "Top Secret"

07:02.099 --> 07:04.291
and I'm only permitted a skeleton
crew.

07:04.411 --> 07:07.208
Sorry about that Captain, you just get us
to our station and we'll do our bit.

07:08.195 --> 07:11.143
I've no engineers, no weapons
operators and no kitchen staff.

07:11.427 --> 07:14.165
So "your bit" may well involve
a mop and bucket in the galley.

07:14.285 --> 07:16.065
We will do whatever it takes.

07:16.326 --> 07:17.248
Captain.

07:17.661 --> 07:19.464
I would like to see the creature
now please.

07:19.584 --> 07:20.055
Sam.

07:20.175 --> 07:20.974
****

07:21.094 --> 07:21.731
Aye Captain.

07:24.511 --> 07:27.607
Oh....
Sorry. (Bangs head) That hurt.

07:28.873 --> 07:31.928
First thing you learn about life on
board a submarine... Think small

07:32.048 --> 07:33.222
and thin.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.818
You'll be all right.

07:35.167 --> 07:36.681
It's aft.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.020
- Right
- This way.

07:45.427 --> 07:47.918
We're going to need access to
your torpedo bay too.

07:48.661 --> 07:49.625
Why?

07:50.244 --> 07:53.051
Captain, like I said, we've got a job
to do so just let us get it done

07:53.171 --> 07:54.868
and you can drop us on shore
in the morning, yeah?

08:16.281 --> 08:17.327
There you go.

08:20.794 --> 08:22.872
Now what....
is that?

08:25.456 --> 08:28.910
Some kind of theropod,
a juvenile.

08:30.768 --> 08:32.309
Thero.... what?

08:33.462 --> 08:34.192
Pod.

08:35.073 --> 08:38.938
We think some species could swim,
not extensively but...

08:39.558 --> 08:41.347
enough to move between islands.

08:42.490 --> 08:46.247
She must have been in the water,
sucked through the anomaly.

08:47.183 --> 08:48.339
What's an anomaly?

08:48.459 --> 08:50.334
Oh, that's classified.

08:52.395 --> 08:58.587
But it's a dinosaur right? A real
live, dead, dinosaur.

09:00.731 --> 09:03.401
- You were right the first time.
- Uh... it's alive?

09:03.993 --> 09:07.364
The North Sea's much colder than she's
used to. She's gone into a state of shock.

09:08.585 --> 09:11.355
We have to keep her that way,
can we secure this freezer?

09:11.475 --> 09:14.327
- Well there's an electrical lock.
- Ok good, give me a hand.

09:15.359 --> 09:18.491
She won't bite, unless we
don't get her in there fast enough.

09:19.873 --> 09:20.671
Thank you.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.827
So this torpedo is going to fire an
electronic charge onto the anomaly

09:27.947 --> 09:31.144
on impact. It's basically a mobile
underwater locking device.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.194
- That's very clever.
- Thank you very much.

09:34.553 --> 09:35.764
Lock it.

09:36.548 --> 09:37.828
Gently.

09:39.947 --> 09:40.980
Good work.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.551
Listen Matt, umm...

09:42.964 --> 09:45.221
I know I've not really been
in the game lately.

09:46.212 --> 09:49.336
It's just this work with
Philip it's... it's exciting and

09:52.698 --> 09:54.143
I hope you understand.

09:54.872 --> 09:56.028
I understand.

09:57.556 --> 10:02.207
I know it must be difficult, cause...
I know how Abby feels about Philip.

10:03.565 --> 10:04.927
Tell me about it.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.491
You know if you ever want to talk about
anything that you can't talk

10:08.611 --> 10:10.308
-  to Abby about you can....
-  Tell your crew that they're not to

10:10.428 --> 10:12.675
unlock that freezer under any
circumstances, ok?

10:13.618 --> 10:14.540
Yes sir.

10:14.926 --> 10:16.770
Mum

10:17.609 --> 10:21.118
Small theropod, swimmer, still
alive.

10:21.669 --> 10:24.517
- What?
- It's ok, she's secure, she's unconscious.

10:25.385 --> 10:26.279
So how long until we get there?

10:26.399 --> 10:28.770
Well the Captain's still charting
a course, umm...

10:28.890 --> 10:30.421
It'll be a few hours at least.

10:30.693 --> 10:33.018
- You should rest while you can.
- Thanks.

10:36.734 --> 10:38.619
It's good to go.

10:52.074 --> 10:54.537
***** submarines and his
commander are here.

10:58.611 --> 11:00.014
Oh, perfect.

11:02.053 --> 11:05.218
Admiral. Welcome to the Anomaly
Research Center.

11:05.338 --> 11:09.526
Professor Lester. The Minister briefed
me about your little unit

11:09.646 --> 11:12.302
several months ago. I hope
your people know what their doing.

11:12.784 --> 11:14.077
I hope yours do too.

11:15.756 --> 11:19.403
If you'd like to step this way,
we've established a command center.

11:20.313 --> 11:24.207
I need a dedicated line to the admiralty
and another one to Whitehall.

11:24.620 --> 11:27.758
You can establish coms to H.M.S.
Garthside, I presume?

11:28.005 --> 11:28.872
Of course,

11:28.992 --> 11:32.574
their scheduled to send us a signal as soon
as they reach the site of the anomaly.

11:33.065 --> 11:35.804
H.M.S. Garthside should be in
position anytime now.

11:36.657 --> 11:39.560
This is all rather routine for
us these days,

11:39.680 --> 11:44.105
why don't you get some sleep. We'll
alert you when the situations resolved.

11:45.735 --> 11:47.703
I'll take a pot of coffee.

11:50.964 --> 11:55.836
Us too. Mine with cream, no sugar.
How do you take yours Jess?

11:56.537 --> 11:58.808
Frothy, thanks very much Admiral.

12:03.968 --> 12:08.193
I understand your man intends to seal
this anomaly by firing a torpedo

12:08.313 --> 12:11.605
rewired to pass an electromagnetic
charge through it.

12:11.725 --> 12:14.258
- That's correct.
- Why don't we just blow it up?

12:16.322 --> 12:18.992
We do things different in
our "Little Unit".

12:20.519 --> 12:24.992
This man, Connor Temple, he's an
elite operative, of course?

12:25.308 --> 12:28.955
Yes. Yes indeed, the very highest
caliber.

12:33.899 --> 12:35.661
- Connor.
- What?

12:41.406 --> 12:43.883
- You're doing it again.
- I'm not doing anything me feet are down.

12:46.126 --> 12:48.768
She's brilliant. It's kind
of like we're all camping out.

12:48.888 --> 12:51.479
Thought you two would have had enough
camping in your year in the Cretaceous.

12:52.082 --> 12:53.899
Does anybody want to hear a
ghost story?

12:57.256 --> 12:58.013
Huh?

12:58.571 --> 13:01.653
What? It's not like we've got anything
to do until we get to the anomaly.

13:04.034 --> 13:04.832
Fine.

13:09.814 --> 13:11.314
7-3-1

13:13.653 --> 13:15.745
We're over *****station Captain.

13:15.865 --> 13:19.103
All stop, two thirds.
It's drifting there.

13:26.526 --> 13:29.925
- Officer Neal, get some coffee on.
- Yes sir.

13:34.642 --> 13:37.519
Sam, release the sonar array,
let's report our position.

13:37.639 --> 13:38.454
Aye Captain.

14:22.967 --> 14:26.036
I sent our position sir.
Anything else to add?

14:28.417 --> 14:30.054
It's happening again.

14:30.174 --> 14:32.628
- Electrical interference.
- What the hell is that?

14:57.711 --> 14:59.362
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.160
Pull.

15:05.073 --> 15:07.894
We'vd lost primary power...
and the Captain.

15:15.940 --> 15:19.133
Electrical sparking and popping)

16:01.764 --> 16:05.384
H.M.S. Garthside. This is the Arc,
are you receiving me? Over.

16:06.512 --> 16:07.833
What just happened?

16:07.953 --> 16:11.329
H.M.S. Garthside transmitted their last
position, then the coms link went down

16:11.449 --> 16:12.787
when I tried to acknowledge.

16:12.907 --> 16:15.058
They're not responding to
the radio transmission.

16:15.178 --> 16:16.765
I'll try a data uplink.

16:19.105 --> 16:20.811
They're headed straight for
the anomaly.

16:24.976 --> 16:27.536
I'm getting nothing. They're
completely out of contact.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.343
Suffered a major electrical
failure.

16:30.701 --> 16:33.315
The backup systems kicked in but
the juice is needed primarily

16:33.435 --> 16:35.490
for oxygen supply and
emergency lighting.

16:35.610 --> 16:36.907
Ok, where's Mr. Neal?

16:37.027 --> 16:38.390
He went to make coffee,
I haven't seen him.

16:38.510 --> 16:40.674
Mr. Shaw could you try to
find Mr. Neal, thanks.

16:40.794 --> 16:42.188
Sam, get me a damage assessment.

16:42.308 --> 16:43.124
Abby how is he?

16:43.244 --> 16:45.142
He has a bad concussion.
He could be out for a while.

16:45.262 --> 16:47.083
We have limited instrumentation,

16:47.203 --> 16:49.821
basic navigation but something's
jammed the propeller.

16:49.941 --> 16:51.183
Right now we're just drifting.

16:51.303 --> 16:54.225
A big metal tube somewhere in the
vicinity of a magnetized anomaly.

16:54.345 --> 16:55.849
Anyone else see where this is
going?

16:55.969 --> 16:58.178
I'm picking up a very strange
signal heading straight for us.

16:59.871 --> 17:03.394
- It's not heading for us.
- We're heading for it.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.418
Where'd....

17:54.293 --> 17:56.192
Where's my submarine?

18:24.711 --> 18:26.279
That's impossible.

18:26.399 --> 18:30.247
We've gone from 150 feet
of water to a depth of 120.

18:30.367 --> 18:31.472
We've gone through the
anomaly.

18:31.592 --> 18:33.605
- Could be Jurassic.
- Jurassic!

18:33.725 --> 18:36.546
- We've no power or steering.
- Well unless everyone wants to go and swim

18:36.666 --> 18:38.349
we better think of something
fast.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.248
Where in the hell are we?
What just happened?

18:40.368 --> 18:42.092
Just calm down officer, ok?

18:42.212 --> 18:44.335
Well the Jurassic Era, that was like
thousands of years ago.

18:44.455 --> 18:47.335
Well 200, 245 million years
ago if you're gonna be...

18:47.455 --> 18:48.477
What I'm just telling him.

18:48.597 --> 18:51.083
We've just done some freaky time travel
thing. That's what anomalies are.

18:51.203 --> 18:52.238
Who are you people?

18:52.358 --> 18:54.330
We're the people who deal with this sort of
thing and we're going to need your help.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.610
I'm just a sonar officer.

18:55.730 --> 18:58.527
Sam your senior officer is disabled,
that makes you the ranking officer.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.225
Ok the first thing we need to
do is restore power.

19:02.345 --> 19:04.564
Now I need the ships wiring plan,
ok, Captain?

19:07.137 --> 19:08.197
Good man.

19:11.071 --> 19:14.773
This is the primary electrical
grid. I have a hard copy.

19:15.158 --> 19:17.869
Right, can you show me the wire
that leads to the mainframe power source?

19:17.989 --> 19:18.874
This one.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.682
It's a daisy chain that feeds through
four junction boxes throughout the ship.

19:22.802 --> 19:24.429
One maybe more fuses are
fried.

19:24.549 --> 19:26.053
Ok, this is good, let's check the
fuses,

19:26.173 --> 19:27.677
repair any damage. What about
the propeller?

19:27.797 --> 19:29.656
We lost signal from the sonar
array when we were attacked

19:29.776 --> 19:31.858
my guess is the cable's got
trapped around the propeller.

19:31.978 --> 19:34.459
I'll go. We've got a mini-submersible
that I can deploy.

19:34.579 --> 19:36.908
No. I need you here. You're the only
person can start this ship again.

19:37.028 --> 19:40.088
It takes two crew. One to steer and one
to operate the cutting equipment.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.065
I'll come then.

19:41.185 --> 19:43.624
No. Definitely need you here.
You need to sort this wiring out.

19:43.744 --> 19:45.942
Let's get the Captain into a
bunk. Me and Abby'll go.

19:46.062 --> 19:48.006
What about the creature that attacked
us. It could have followed

19:48.126 --> 19:49.685
us through the anomaly. It
could still be out there.

19:49.805 --> 19:51.433
If we stay close to the sub
we may not register.

19:51.553 --> 19:52.905
We may look like another
large creature.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.181
- Ready?
- Let's go.

19:54.301 --> 19:57.402
I have absolute faith in my team. If they
decided to enter the anomaly

19:57.522 --> 19:58.764
they did so for a good reason.

19:59.411 --> 20:00.140
No.

20:01.013 --> 20:02.513
They've had their chance.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.793
Get in touch with the Admiralty and H.M.S.
Frost. Move the Vanguard into position.

20:06.913 --> 20:09.504
Vanguard... isn't that a
nuclear submarine?

20:09.624 --> 20:10.467
What are you doing?

20:12.056 --> 20:14.574
That anomaly is smack bang in
the middle of one of the

20:14.694 --> 20:16.735
busiest submarine vectors
on the planet.

20:17.116 --> 20:21.121
The Russians, the Americans, the Chinese
all sneak around playing hide and seek in

20:21.241 --> 20:22.387
in those waters.

20:22.865 --> 20:26.402
Can you imagine what would happen if one
of their nuclear subs disappeared

20:26.522 --> 20:28.122
off the coast of Britain?

20:28.837 --> 20:30.805
Could start World War III.

20:35.129 --> 20:38.046
Don't worry, it'll take them hours
to get the Vanguard into position.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.335
What do you think he's got
in that briefcase?

20:43.306 --> 20:45.150
Not his sandwiches, that's
for sure.

20:45.921 --> 20:50.889
We just have to hope the team reappear
before the Admiral opens his Pandora's box.

21:28.592 --> 21:32.487
Sam, I found the first box,
three of the fuses are fried

21:33.265 --> 21:36.664
and the trip switch is popped,
but I... I can fix this.

21:36.980 --> 21:38.921
Has Officer Shaw found our
missing crewman yet?

21:40.930 --> 21:42.953
Officer Shaw please respond.

21:45.642 --> 21:46.963
Officer Neal.

21:50.541 --> 21:51.793
Officer Neal.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.629
I'll hold this steady and
you feed the cable

21:58.749 --> 21:59.469
Ok.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.355
Will.

22:42.801 --> 22:43.998
That wasn't me.

22:45.264 --> 22:46.393
Sam was that Shaw?

22:47.026 --> 22:47.961
I think so.

22:48.539 --> 22:51.842
It came from the coms in the storage
room. Where that creature was.

22:57.738 --> 22:58.963
What was that?

23:00.559 --> 23:01.784
Can't see.

23:07.245 --> 23:10.341
Ok, Sam where's the armory?
We might need weapons.

23:10.461 --> 23:13.974
Only Neal and the Captain have
access. I'm just a midshipman.

23:14.094 --> 23:14.580
Ok.

23:15.172 --> 23:18.915
Seal yourself in the Con. Whatever happens
you get Abby and Matt back on board.

23:19.149 --> 23:19.713
Ok.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.317
Just one more piece to go.
Get ready to pull out.

23:25.437 --> 23:25.744
Ok.

23:27.051 --> 23:28.111
What the...

23:32.914 --> 23:34.331
Come on, come on.

23:43.848 --> 23:44.949
Ok, got it.

23:57.753 --> 23:59.170
Pliosaur.

24:02.638 --> 24:04.193
Pliosaurs.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.615
I'll check outside, see if
we're food.

24:17.453 --> 24:19.283
- Ok, cut the power.
- What?

24:19.403 --> 24:20.893
Cut the power we're going to
play dead.

24:52.062 --> 24:53.135
Get ready.

25:01.196 --> 25:02.779
Full reverse thrust, ok?

25:03.013 --> 25:03.756
Ok.

25:05.668 --> 25:06.467
Go.

25:26.569 --> 25:27.491
Thank you.

25:28.943 --> 25:32.672
H.M.S. Frost will be on station in 10
minutes to resolve this.

25:34.406 --> 25:35.425
10 minutes?

25:37.351 --> 25:39.484
You've had it on standby all
along.

25:39.867 --> 25:42.716
I had a hunch that <i>your</i> people
couldn't pull this off.

25:42.836 --> 25:45.468
not underwater...
and I was right.

25:46.197 --> 25:48.358
- Initiate firing control procedures.
- Yes sir.

25:48.478 --> 25:50.464
Anomalies are <i>my</i> jurisdiction.

25:50.584 --> 25:52.492
National security is mine.

25:52.795 --> 25:55.244
This operation is now under
Naval command.

25:55.364 --> 25:58.588
Nuking an anomaly won't work.

26:04.487 --> 26:08.725
Nuking <i>anything</i> works.

26:10.170 --> 26:14.051
Look. All you need to seal this anomaly
is to pass an EM pulse through it.

26:14.171 --> 26:15.690
My armament will do that.

26:15.810 --> 26:19.901
And have you considered the
implications to the earth's timeline

26:20.021 --> 26:23.534
of detonating a nuclear device in
a prehistoric era?

26:24.053 --> 26:26.682
We could cease to exist or
be turned into pond life.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.062
The Admiralty deemed it an
acceptable risk.

26:30.105 --> 26:32.844
Have we alerted Washington, Moscow,
Shanghai?

26:32.964 --> 26:33.711
You told them about the anomaly.

26:33.831 --> 26:37.509
No. We've told them there's been an accident
aboard one of our nuclear submarines

26:37.629 --> 26:40.482
and asked them to remove all their
personal from the area.

26:41.517 --> 26:42.646
Young lady.

26:43.017 --> 26:45.921
I need secure coms to H.M.S. Frost.

26:47.861 --> 26:50.435
Those pliosaurs are not going to
ignore us for long.

26:55.544 --> 26:56.305
Hey.

26:56.425 --> 26:58.066
- Any sign of Mr. Shaw?
- No.

26:58.186 --> 27:01.479
All right we have to assume the creatures
got him. How do I talk to Connor?

27:04.407 --> 27:05.053
Connor.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.581
Propellers good to go.

27:06.898 --> 27:08.865
There's a pod of pliosaurs out there
waiting to get at us.

27:08.985 --> 27:10.558
How you gettiin' on with those
fuse boxes?

27:10.678 --> 27:11.810
One more left to find.

27:12.373 --> 27:15.125
Ok watch your back.
Abby and me are going after the theropod.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.029
- Abby you're gonna take the lower deck.
- Ok.

27:19.323 --> 27:20.740
Take this.

27:21.001 --> 27:21.676
Here.

27:22.122 --> 27:23.622
- Serious?
- Yeah.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.521
Thanks, what about you?

27:25.641 --> 27:27.296
I'll improvise.

27:29.801 --> 27:30.585
Good luck.

27:36.110 --> 27:38.160
- Can you show me the way?
- Come on.

27:44.679 --> 27:46.151
This is great isn't it.

27:47.661 --> 27:49.547
Creatures outside where
we can't see 'em.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.161
Creature inside where we
got no lights and no exit.

27:52.698 --> 27:54.776
Got to be honest,

27:54.896 --> 27:57.652
I prefer hunting dinosaurs on dry land
at least you can see 'em coming.

27:58.189 --> 27:59.881
Connor have you found that
final box yet?

28:01.230 --> 28:04.258
Well... I'm definitely in the
right place,

28:04.822 --> 28:08.056
but it looks like someone's relocated the
junction without updating the schematic

28:08.176 --> 28:10.100
which is... useful.

28:10.220 --> 28:12.439
Well hurry up. Without power we can't
get back through the anomaly.

28:13.816 --> 28:14.889
Really.

28:15.605 --> 28:18.688
Ok... Cause there was I thinking we
could just all stick our arms out

28:18.808 --> 28:21.151
of the portholes and paddle
our way back to the 21st century.

28:23.085 --> 28:25.521
Uh... sorry, just find it ok?

28:25.865 --> 28:29.264
Finding 'em, finding it.

29:06.777 --> 29:08.388
We're taking on water.

29:18.947 --> 29:22.236
Connor! The attack is just going to get
more and more sustained. You need

29:22.356 --> 29:23.915
to find that fuse box and fix it...
Now!

29:38.056 --> 29:41.207
H.M.S. Frost from Admiral Marsden.

29:41.703 --> 29:45.267
You are authorized to deploy
nuclear weapons

29:45.901 --> 29:49.479
on target vector 651 Delta.

29:49.879 --> 29:52.246
Initiate firing code procedures.

29:56.593 --> 30:00.088
James Lester, I'd like to speak to
the Minister please, it's urgent.

30:36.419 --> 30:37.149
Connor.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.621
Uh. Yeah. Friendly Connor.

30:38.741 --> 30:41.841
Harmless Connor. Get that spanner
out of me face Connor.

30:43.891 --> 30:44.621
You all right?

30:44.741 --> 30:45.254
Yeah.

30:45.374 --> 30:46.437
Oh!

30:49.831 --> 30:51.909
- You find the final fuse box?
- No.

30:52.029 --> 30:56.395
Not yet. There's only one last compartment
where all the critical wiring runs to and

30:57.566 --> 30:58.942
that's down there.

31:00.841 --> 31:01.873
Go on then.

31:03.511 --> 31:04.570
Thanks very much.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.090
I see.

31:14.204 --> 31:15.429
Thats...

31:17.724 --> 31:19.609
Yes Minister, of course.

31:20.325 --> 31:23.077
Well... have a good apocalypse.

31:24.302 --> 31:27.150
You're already ****,
you won't notice the difference.

31:48.137 --> 31:50.160
Five minutes till they fire.

32:03.268 --> 32:05.470
This part of the sub must have
taken the brunt of the attack.

32:09.259 --> 32:10.029
Ok.

32:12.988 --> 32:14.130
There it is.

32:27.606 --> 32:28.862
- Do this, get on the box.
- What?

32:28.982 --> 32:32.344
On the box, out of the water.
Snarling thing right.

32:39.097 --> 32:40.872
Snarling thing.

32:45.510 --> 32:46.349
Good work.

32:48.756 --> 32:51.412
All right Matt, we've found
the final fuse box.

32:51.532 --> 32:53.862
And captured the theropod.

32:58.376 --> 32:59.807
She's alive.

33:14.094 --> 33:15.168
Coms back on?

33:15.288 --> 33:16.833
- Yes.
- Good.

33:19.048 --> 33:20.782
It won't take much more of this.

33:20.902 --> 33:22.833
How long till we've got enough
power to reach *****

33:22.953 --> 33:23.589
Not long.

33:23.709 --> 33:25.086
At this rate we'll never make it
though in one piece.

33:25.206 --> 33:26.751
We're going to have to distract
the pliosaurs.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.967
You said you could flood or vent
any compartment at any time

33:29.087 --> 33:30.481
including the torpedo room,
right?

33:30.601 --> 33:31.705
In an emergency, yes.

33:31.825 --> 33:33.137
I think this is an emergency.

33:34.807 --> 33:38.481
Abby. Connor. Take the ****
to the torpedo room, I'll see you there.

33:41.068 --> 33:42.651
T minus 4 minutes.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.073
This is a disproportionate response
Admiral.

33:45.307 --> 33:47.508
My people will be dealing
with the problem.

33:47.628 --> 33:49.991
Your people are long ago and
far away.

33:50.111 --> 33:53.555
- We have no choice.
- Killing four of your team, three of mine?

33:53.675 --> 33:55.729
Irradiating God knows what era.

33:55.849 --> 33:59.379
I'm sorry Mr. Lester, but this is a
matter of global security.

34:00.007 --> 34:02.308
Someone has to take
these decisions.

34:02.847 --> 34:05.457
Regretfully.... that's me.

34:09.165 --> 34:10.188
This way.

34:10.308 --> 34:10.981
Ok.

34:14.735 --> 34:16.143
No way she's going
to fit in there.

34:16.264 --> 34:19.337
She'll have plenty of help. Room fills
up with water, pressure sucks her out.

34:19.456 --> 34:19.975
Oh.

34:33.802 --> 34:37.050
There's too much damage to get more than
30% power but the propellers working again.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.302
T minus 1 minute.

34:39.216 --> 34:40.813
Ever considered a sports car.

34:41.826 --> 34:45.315
You know... that whole extension
of masculinity thing.

34:47.306 --> 34:50.498
I've got "Dr. Strangelove" on
Blu-Ray if that helps.

34:55.574 --> 34:58.849
We need to get out of here.
Sound the engine fire control alley.

34:58.969 --> 35:00.721
Abby, Connor, you can steer the ship.
Come on.

35:02.078 --> 35:03.220
Come on Matt.

35:03.715 --> 35:04.734
Now what do we do?

35:04.854 --> 35:05.917
Full astern.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.036
English please, nobody
speaks navy.

35:08.156 --> 35:08.821
Backwards.

35:12.505 --> 35:14.270
Let's everybody pretend
video game, right?

35:17.118 --> 35:19.224
Abby, that is us right there.

35:19.344 --> 35:21.702
That area is the anomaly. You've got to
uide us right through the middle, ok.

35:21.822 --> 35:22.693
- Ok.
- Sam.

35:22.813 --> 35:24.799
We're going to go through the anomaly
backwards and then you're going

35:24.919 --> 35:25.831
to take the war shot, ok.

35:25.951 --> 35:26.780
Understood.

35:28.434 --> 35:30.911
- Distance to the anomaly?
- 500 feet.

35:31.031 --> 35:32.040
Hold steady.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.757
Let's feed these fishes, yeah?

35:57.129 --> 35:58.461
Be my guest.

36:06.633 --> 36:08.141
Hold it steady you'll be ok.

36:15.499 --> 36:16.479
It's working.

36:16.986 --> 36:18.230
Their taking the bait.

36:19.408 --> 36:20.167
Come on.

36:22.167 --> 36:24.710
Good work everybody but stay
in present course and state.

36:24.830 --> 36:25.866
Nearly there.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.372
Torpedo away.

36:48.427 --> 36:49.439
Their back!

36:50.089 --> 36:51.817
And the nuke is heading
straight for them.

36:51.937 --> 36:53.017
Disarm that torpedo.

36:53.137 --> 36:55.627
H.M.S. Frost, this is the Arc, I have
an Admiral Marsden for you.

36:56.347 --> 36:58.450
Abort, Abort now.

36:58.570 --> 37:01.268
Congratulations Admiral. You just
fired a nuclear weapon

37:01.388 --> 37:03.547
in peacetime at one of
your own submarines.

37:14.531 --> 37:16.337
Depth, 160 feet.

37:16.457 --> 37:17.262
We did it.

37:18.131 --> 37:20.884
Ok, Sam, stand by with
Connors torpedo.

37:21.434 --> 37:22.843
We're going to seal this anomaly.

37:22.963 --> 37:25.578
- What's that?
- Incoming torpedo.

37:26.305 --> 37:27.912
Planes down 10 degrees.

37:28.032 --> 37:29.021
Hard port.

37:29.141 --> 37:30.411
**** won't be taking the shot.

37:30.531 --> 37:32.365
Turn left, dive, dive.

37:33.738 --> 37:35.268
It's going to hit them.

38:09.844 --> 38:11.991
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
What happened there.

38:12.734 --> 38:14.192
They got out of the way.

38:14.312 --> 38:16.906
Yeah, but the nuke is still
heading towards the anomaly.

38:17.484 --> 38:19.796
It's heading straight for the anomaly,
what shall I do?

38:20.085 --> 38:21.708
We're going to stick with the plan.

38:21.828 --> 38:23.195
Let's stop this anomaly.

38:23.315 --> 38:24.787
You two, straight forward.

38:25.282 --> 38:26.025
You ready?

38:27.470 --> 38:28.475
Fire!

38:28.595 --> 38:29.851
Torpedo away.

38:34.168 --> 38:35.517
There's a second torpedo.

38:35.637 --> 38:36.384
It's Connors.

38:36.797 --> 38:37.884
He's trying to close the anomaly.

38:38.004 --> 38:41.327
H.M.S. Frost I need confirmation
of that abort order.

38:47.905 --> 38:49.199
Impact!

38:49.319 --> 38:49.892
Ok.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.860
Good shooting Captain.

38:55.162 --> 38:57.722
Bet you're glad I made you
play all those video games now.

38:59.168 --> 38:59.925
Yeah.

39:01.503 --> 39:03.819
They did it, the anomaly's locked.

39:04.796 --> 39:05.704
Well.

39:06.723 --> 39:08.718
Well was the nuke
disarmed in time?

39:09.447 --> 39:12.667
They uh... They think so.

39:13.286 --> 39:14.057
Oh.

39:14.525 --> 39:16.341
Well that's reassuring, isn't it?

39:16.878 --> 39:20.759
If not, I think we know what caused
the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.

39:44.322 --> 39:45.368
Hello.

39:45.850 --> 39:46.676
Speaking.

39:48.877 --> 39:50.804
Yes, of course, one moment.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.405
- Admiral.
- Yes.

39:54.905 --> 39:56.941
- It's for you.
- Me.

39:58.703 --> 40:00.010
It's the Prime Minister.

40:04.166 --> 40:05.515
Yes Prime Minister.

40:12.272 --> 40:14.308
I-I can explain everything.

40:24.562 --> 40:27.066
Oh, it's good to breathe fresh
air again.

40:27.186 --> 40:29.598
Uh.. yeah, I should call Philip.

40:30.135 --> 40:33.947
Hey, no, we're back safe and sound.
Listen, I've got an idea.

40:36.799 --> 40:37.818
What's up?

40:39.758 --> 40:40.625
Philip.

40:41.574 --> 40:43.818
Connor called him as soon as
we got back on dry land.

40:47.345 --> 40:48.873
When we started
working together,

40:49.437 --> 40:51.488
for a moment there it was
like it used to be.

40:53.331 --> 40:56.070
Yeah, I know, they should be fine.
Yeah, I...

40:57.818 --> 40:59.510
He's full of secrets.

41:02.211 --> 41:03.559
Hey.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.224
Come on.

41:28.344 --> 41:29.596
Coming home?

41:29.954 --> 41:31.385
Listen Abby, I-I

41:31.505 --> 41:33.532
I really want to get
this finished so...

41:47.030 --> 41:47.979
What's up?

41:49.094 --> 41:50.470
You know how much
I believe in you.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.462
And I'm really happy you're
enjoying your new work.

41:57.874 --> 42:00.296
- But?
- But...

42:02.450 --> 42:04.914
There's something
not right about Philip.

42:05.450 --> 42:07.019
I don't trust him Connor.

42:07.721 --> 42:09.414
- Abby...
- You trust my instincts,

42:10.102 --> 42:15.524
you always have, and right now my gut is
telling me you need to pull away from this.

42:18.389 --> 42:22.035
Listen, I-I understand

42:22.155 --> 42:25.049
the reasons why you feel the way
you do about Philip

42:25.169 --> 42:27.375
I-I totally get it. The menagerie
thing that's

42:27.495 --> 42:28.627
It's not about the creatures.

42:31.590 --> 42:33.434
You just gotta trust me on this.

42:39.462 --> 42:41.045
How bout you trust me?

42:43.728 --> 42:45.476
Philip's a good man.

42:46.122 --> 42:48.392
And what we're working on, it's
important

42:48.512 --> 42:50.663
and if it all works out the way we
want it to, it's...

42:51.365 --> 42:53.333
It's gonna be so important.

43:00.104 --> 43:01.081
I'll see you at home.

43:03.035 --> 43:06.393
Abby, I promise you, when
this is all finished

43:07.246 --> 43:08.457
you'll be proud of me.

43:10.917 --> 43:12.486
I was already proud of you.

43:33.441 --> 43:34.817
Matt.

43:38.147 --> 43:39.689
- You ok?
- Yeah.

43:41.047 --> 43:45.616
Look... I know your mission is
more important than any of us.

43:46.441 --> 43:48.299
But it's not the only
thing that matters.

43:51.767 --> 43:52.606
What's this.

43:54.114 --> 43:56.054
You want to know what
happened to Emily.

43:57.224 --> 43:58.448
I know you do.
