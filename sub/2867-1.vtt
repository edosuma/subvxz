01:45.280 --> 01:47.430
Hey, Sebbe!

01:52.240 --> 01:57.951
- I'm going to get wasted.
- You said that yesterday!

01:58.160 --> 02:00.628
Hey, what's up?

02:00.840 --> 02:04.435
When are you going to play, Sebbe?
It's been ages.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.996
- Isn't it time you got a gig?
- Yeah, yeah, I will.

02:08.199 --> 02:12.113
- You have to work hard to succeed.
- Stop nagging!

02:12.320 --> 02:16.074
- Excuse me, there are two of you?
- Yes.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.599
He doesn't mean us.

02:18.240 --> 02:23.109
- Wait 'til I get my record deal.
- Your dad's money'll run out one day!

02:23.320 --> 02:25.197
Pay for your own booze!

02:25.400 --> 02:28.358
I should be on the list. Mia EkstrÃ¶m!

02:28.560 --> 02:31.950
I don't have anyone by that name.
Guest list only tonight.

02:32.160 --> 02:36.472
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Please, I hear Stureplan is great!

02:36.680 --> 02:39.717
- And I'm going home tomorrow!
- Excuse me...

02:39.920 --> 02:46.359
- They put me on the list yesterday.
- I'm busy! Try again later.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.357
- Hi
- Hi

02:51.720 --> 02:56.032
But your colleague
promised me... and my friends!

02:56.240 --> 03:00.119
- What, you're together?
- Yes! Why wouldn't you believe that?

03:00.320 --> 03:05.553
- How many in your group?
- Uh... six.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.915
- Okay then. Welcome.
- What happened, Mia?

03:12.120 --> 03:15.829
- What a weird girl!
- Sebbe, help me out here.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.032
Oskar's paying!
The first round, anyway.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.633
- Jesus! Watch your step, hippo!
- Excuse me?!

03:55.840 --> 03:58.035
Just ignore him, honey. We all do.

03:58.240 --> 04:02.279
- Why are you so slow?
- I can't hear you!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.154
Nice voice.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.475
Nice tits.

05:02.920 --> 05:08.631
'Code GRANDMA. Bring breakfast! '

05:09.320 --> 05:13.871
I understand, sweetheart,
but you need to remember,

05:14.080 --> 05:17.470
grandma had a good, long life.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.238
- Hi.
- Zup.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.715
She's in a better place now.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.433
Yeah, mom...
I'll try to pull myself together.

05:26.640 --> 05:30.553
I'll come over later.
I need to get the door now.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.472
Hi... Grandma...

05:34.680 --> 05:35.715
What?

05:35.920 --> 05:41.756
She was Norway's most famous
tap dancer, a pioneer in the genre.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.674
And for her to die...

05:45.880 --> 05:50.908
falling down a staircase...
In Stavanger!

05:51.120 --> 05:54.351
- Three flights!
- Wow, that's terrible.

05:54.560 --> 05:57.677
Maybe I should go now...

06:00.400 --> 06:03.517
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.114
- Too much?
- Un poquito.

06:20.120 --> 06:26.150
That bald record producer was here
yesterday looking at the blue blazer.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.191
Hammarsten?

06:28.400 --> 06:31.517
Did you play my demo?

06:31.720 --> 06:35.952
Uh, no, sorry. He wasn't here long.
We didn't have his size.

06:37.160 --> 06:42.029
- Shit! I always miss him.
- Didn't they want to sign you once?

06:42.240 --> 06:49.112
I thought so... But they signed some
"Idol" loser with the same "look".

06:49.320 --> 06:55.395
What bullshit. Have you seen anyone
who looks like me on "Idol"?

06:57.360 --> 07:01.876
I suppose I should send in my demo.
Keep in touch.

07:03.520 --> 07:07.149
Hammarsten is awesome;
he's worked with everyone.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.433
Hey, why don't you unpack
today's delivery?

07:11.640 --> 07:14.916
If his size came in,
you can call him!

07:15.120 --> 07:16.439
Sounds fun.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.713
I, uh, put on your demo.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.708
- And he left his card.
- No way!

07:29.840 --> 07:31.717
What the? Wh?

07:31.920 --> 07:36.516
- What did he... Should I?
- Just call him.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.393
- Now?!
- Yeah.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.829
Yeah!

08:03.880 --> 08:07.429
I need my brows shaped, too.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.159
- Welcome! Can I take your coat?
- No thanks, I just saw my son there.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.555
Sebastian!

08:18.760 --> 08:21.320
- Hi!
- Hi, Mom.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.353
Oh, you're soaking! Heading home?

08:24.560 --> 08:28.394
- No, to the cemetery.
- It's the 20th already?

08:28.600 --> 08:32.717
Yes. He would have been 27 today.
I can wait if you want to come.

08:32.919 --> 08:37.710
No, I have a lot going on tonight,
I won't have time.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.356
- Okay. Were you off today?
- No, I worked...

08:41.559 --> 08:45.599
And I talked to a music producer
who heard my demo!

08:47.040 --> 08:50.430
What did he say?
Have you bought clothes again!

08:50.640 --> 08:55.555
Honey, it's no wonder your paycheck
doesn't last. Really!

08:55.760 --> 09:00.788
He said he'll call later this week
and his label may want to sign me.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.757
- I think it'll happen this time!
- Well, that's good, I guess.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.710
- I've got to go now.
- Can't you tell Dad?

09:11.920 --> 09:14.514
- About what?
- The record label!

09:14.720 --> 09:19.077
- Tell him yourself.
- He'll just go on about that job.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.150
- Can't you just let him call...
- No, Mom, it's not going to happen.

09:25.360 --> 09:30.559
- You can't be a store clerk forever!
- I'm not a store clerk!

09:31.760 --> 09:35.116
I'm getting a record contract!
Stop worrying about me.

09:35.320 --> 09:40.314
I never worry about you.
People like you always get by.

09:41.320 --> 09:45.359
- "People like me"?
- Talk to you later!

10:15.160 --> 10:18.869
- What do you think?
- It sounds good.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.277
- But?
- Are you planning on working today?

10:23.840 --> 10:27.799
Can you pass me
the labels behind you?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.518
Thanks...

10:33.720 --> 10:37.633
- The head office still bugging you?
- No.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.118
- I'm getting promoted.
- Yeah? To what?

10:42.320 --> 10:47.678
Purchaser for Scandinavia.
I'll work at the head office.

10:47.880 --> 10:53.000
- And attend all the European shows!
- Only the European ones?

10:54.080 --> 10:58.153
I'm kidding! That's great!
Why didn't you tell me?

10:58.360 --> 11:00.157
Sweet!

11:02.080 --> 11:04.150
- When do you start?
- In June.

11:04.360 --> 11:08.433
That's totally awesome.
You deserve it.

11:09.440 --> 11:13.479
And I'll be stuck here
in the storeroom.

11:14.080 --> 11:19.234
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't
work here. I just feel...

11:20.720 --> 11:25.396
- I can't take it!
- Seriously, you don't "work" much.

11:25.600 --> 11:31.232
You mostly just surf on your iPhone.
You haven't worked a full day...

11:31.440 --> 11:33.954
Quiet! Hang on, hang on...

11:35.120 --> 11:37.588
Sebastian.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.190
Hi!

11:40.560 --> 11:42.437
I'm great, thanks.

11:42.640 --> 11:47.760
No, I'm not busy.
I'm actually off work today.

11:47.960 --> 11:53.193
Sure, I'm in the neighborhood anyway.
Great, see you later. Bye.

11:53.400 --> 11:56.676
- YES! The record company!
- What did they say?

11:56.880 --> 12:00.395
- To be there in a half hour!
- Hey! Sebbe!

12:00.600 --> 12:05.720
- The jacket?
- Dock my pay or something.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.593
Hi, I'm Jens Hammarsten.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.997
I mean, I'm here to see him.
I'm Sebastian Silverberg.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.599
One moment, please.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.156
I have a Sebastian Silverberg here.
Okay.

12:21.360 --> 12:26.673
- Around the corner, 4th on the left.
- Fourth door. Thanks.

12:29.600 --> 12:35.152
- Let's keep in touch, Sebbe. Later.
- Bye, uh, later!

13:05.960 --> 13:10.317
- Are you coming? We're freezing!
- Go in! I'm on my way.

13:10.520 --> 13:14.752
- Look, is Pelle there?
- What do you want with him?

13:14.960 --> 13:18.157
Enough with your Norwegian accent!
Give me Pelle!

13:18.360 --> 13:22.512
We're going in.
I'm going to the bar.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.234
Sebbe! Hello?

13:25.440 --> 13:28.910
Hello? He's not there!

13:29.120 --> 13:31.076
- Hello?
- Yes! Congrats!

13:31.280 --> 13:35.239
- A contract, that's sweet, man!
- I know.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.989
It's incredible. And it's about time!

13:39.200 --> 13:45.594
- Is it a done deal? Have you signed?
- I need a lawyer to check it first.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.590
- I wondered if you could help me?
- Of course!

13:50.800 --> 13:54.031
Hey, I see a taxi.
Tonight's going to be awesome!

14:33.880 --> 14:36.235
Hello?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.514
Hello?

14:42.440 --> 14:45.193
Can someone help me?

14:46.520 --> 14:51.275
Hello!? Can someone help me?!

14:52.720 --> 14:55.951
Hello!? Hello!?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.631
Can you see the light?

15:10.640 --> 15:12.437
No.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.272
- Now?
- No.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.038
- Now?
- No.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.155
- And now?
- No.

15:25.800 --> 15:30.191
- Does your head hurt?
- Yes, back here.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.275
- The back of your head?
- Yeah... or sort of everywhere.

15:35.480 --> 15:40.156
Let me take a look at the other eye.
Do you see the light now?

15:40.360 --> 15:44.558
No! I don't see any fucking light!
What the hell is wrong?!

15:44.760 --> 15:48.992
Stop crying, Mom! What's wrong?!
Don't touch me!

16:07.480 --> 16:11.678
Your son had an aneurysm.

16:11.880 --> 16:18.353
The fall caused it to burst, and the
bleeding damaged the visual cortex.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.949
It was a time bomb,

16:23.160 --> 16:26.391
just waiting to go off.

16:26.600 --> 16:31.310
But he will be able
to see again, right?

16:31.520 --> 16:35.274
- He will get his sight back?
- I'm sorry.

16:35.480 --> 16:40.554
It's highly unlikely
that it will return naturally.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.354
The good news is that
Sebastian is being treated,

16:45.560 --> 16:48.074
so he's in no danger.

16:48.280 --> 16:53.035
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.

16:53.240 --> 16:56.869
- Wait? For what?
- To see if his condition changes.

16:57.080 --> 17:03.474
And seek new treatments. There's
progress all the time in this field.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.789
We'll keep searching.
We can't just do nothing.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.388
I refuse to accept this!

17:13.599 --> 17:17.275
You heard the doctor,
his condition may change.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.756
It's pretty cozy in here.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.192
For a while.

18:07.360 --> 18:12.309
- Have you heard from Hammarsten?
- No, that's over.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.829
What? Why?

18:15.040 --> 18:21.229
I don't know. I got a letter
"on behalf of Jens Hammarsten."

18:21.440 --> 18:25.911
- He didn't even call me himself.
- What a fucking fake.

18:28.680 --> 18:32.958
But you're a singer.
You don't need to see to be a star.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.675
Look at Ray Charles,
or Stevie Wonder, or...

18:36.880 --> 18:39.917
- Youssou N'dour.
- What do you mean, Youssou N'dour?

18:40.120 --> 18:43.112
The guy who sings
"Seven Seconds Away."

18:43.320 --> 18:46.517
- He's not blind.
- He's not?

18:50.840 --> 18:54.230
We're going out tonight.
Want to come?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.351
Oh come on!

18:57.240 --> 19:01.677
You going to drag me around
like a seeing-eye dog?

19:01.880 --> 19:03.791
I'm stuck here!

19:04.000 --> 19:08.869
My parents got me an assistant
to help me with my "daily life."

19:10.200 --> 19:14.637
- What daily life? I have no life.
- Of course you do!

19:14.840 --> 19:19.038
Come on, Sebbe! Come out with us
tonight. I'll look after you.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.436
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

19:27.640 --> 19:29.756
Cheers!

19:32.040 --> 19:37.114
The best way to get over a girl
is to "get over" another girl.

19:38.360 --> 19:42.512
- Did you get that Sebbe?
- Why don't you sing something?

19:42.720 --> 19:44.472
- What?
- Cheers!

20:19.680 --> 20:22.353
Erik!

20:22.560 --> 20:25.233
Erik! Erik!

20:32.840 --> 20:34.637
Sorry.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.238
Sorry, sorry!

20:57.160 --> 20:59.116
Erik! Erik!

21:01.840 --> 21:04.115
Erik! Erik!

21:16.280 --> 21:18.840
- Fucking drunk. Get out of here!
- You OK?

21:19.040 --> 21:23.318
- He's not drunk, he's blind!
- Sure he is...

21:23.520 --> 21:27.354
What are you laughing at?
You think this is funny?

21:27.560 --> 21:30.996
Get me a cab. Get me a cab!

21:43.880 --> 21:47.998
- At Gmail?
...dot com, yes.

21:54.160 --> 22:01.316
- What's your password?
- donkeyballs84.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.156
No, there's nothing interesting here.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.909
- Invitations to night clubs...
- Delete.

22:10.120 --> 22:14.591
And you've got mail from Oskar
af StrÃ¶m-de Luca and Pelle Borg.

22:14.800 --> 22:19.078
- They wonder why you never call.
- Delete those too.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.595
Straight ahead, straight...
You know the way.

22:25.520 --> 22:31.197
You're a meter from the couch.
Watch out for the rug.

22:33.160 --> 22:37.312
Cool!
This is some place you've got.

22:42.560 --> 22:45.632
- Are you bringing the guitar?
- No.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.355
- The amp?
- No.

22:58.520 --> 23:03.753
- You collect watches?
- Nah, I just like them.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.916
You can tell a lot
from a person's watch.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.908
Mine came free with a tank of gas.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.991
That says a lot about me, doesn't it?

23:20.720 --> 23:24.952
I can help you post them on eBay
if you like. They'd be worth a lot.

23:25.160 --> 23:31.599
- Why would I sell my watches?
- Oh, uh... I thought that now...

23:33.080 --> 23:36.789
You want some coffee?
I'll go to 7-Eleven.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.389
Yeah.

23:40.360 --> 23:43.511
I'll be back soon.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.633
- Good morning!
- Hello.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.388
Hi.

24:58.080 --> 25:02.915
I brought my guitar.
I thought maybe we could jam.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.432
- Shall we play?
- Nah, I thought I'd get dressed.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.553
- I think it would be good for you.
- I don't feel like it.

25:12.760 --> 25:17.072
You don't have to see the strings.
It's in your muscle memory.

25:17.280 --> 25:21.034
I have a friend who works
at the music school.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.710
He has this group, they're called...

25:24.920 --> 25:30.597
"Everyone Can" - they're special
needs kids. I've heard them play.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.076
They're wicked!
The keyboardist is deaf.

25:34.280 --> 25:38.034
It's wild - how does he do it?

25:39.560 --> 25:44.680
So I asked if they had an opening
for you, because I thought...

25:47.440 --> 25:51.194
Okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry!

25:52.840 --> 25:55.400
Okay, take it easy. Easy!

25:58.200 --> 26:01.033
Okay, take it easy.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.357
Sebastian!

26:17.320 --> 26:20.437
Open up!

26:24.440 --> 26:27.796
Your dad and I
want to help, you know that.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.278
But you have to help us to help you.

26:32.480 --> 26:35.995
- What do you want?
- Is that so hard to understand?

26:36.200 --> 26:39.078
I don't want a fucking
personal assistant!

26:39.280 --> 26:43.159
Condescending jackasses
who push you around.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.831
Or worse, some fat old lady
to wipe my ass and comb my hair.

26:48.040 --> 26:52.272
- Sebastian, that's enough.
- What do you want us to do?

26:52.480 --> 26:57.600
You have no idea how hard
we're working to help you!

26:58.800 --> 27:03.510
Not to mention the apartment
I'm paying for.

27:03.720 --> 27:10.068
- Which is empty and you won't let...
- It's always about money with you!

27:10.280 --> 27:16.310
It's not about money! I'd give
everything we own to make you well.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.631
But we're lost here.
What do you want from us?

27:21.840 --> 27:26.311
I want my fucking sight back!
My life back!

27:27.880 --> 27:31.236
Can you do that?

27:33.280 --> 27:37.432
No, you can't!
So there's not much you can do.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.996
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Mia.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.953
- Come in.
- Thanks

28:12.160 --> 28:16.790
It was a nice walk from the station.
I think spring is finally here.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.474
Yes, it's nice.

28:24.680 --> 28:30.596
- Have you come a long way?
- No, I live in the Hornstull area.

28:30.800 --> 28:35.351
So, Mia, can you tell me
about yourself?

28:35.560 --> 28:40.509
I'm 24, I live
in Hornstull, as I said...

28:40.720 --> 28:44.759
I work three or four evenings a week
in the home help services.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.190
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.712
And on weekends I work
at ÃhlÃ©ns department store.

28:51.920 --> 28:58.029
Well, it's every other week, so I can
work the other weekends with...

28:58.240 --> 29:00.276
Sebastian.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.474
- Which department?
- Gloves and hosiery.

29:03.680 --> 29:08.549
I can get you a 25% discount
if you come while I'm working.

29:10.480 --> 29:15.793
Not that you look like you need
a discount on hosiery.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.551
- Do you have any formal training?
- No.

29:20.760 --> 29:25.436
I don't know what I want to do yet,
so I'm just working and saving up.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.791
Saving is good.
What the hell is this?

29:31.400 --> 29:34.995
Have you invested
in stocks or bonds or what?

29:36.000 --> 29:37.718
A bank account.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.913
- I see. What's your interest rate?
- GÃ¶ran!

29:42.120 --> 29:43.951
What?

29:44.160 --> 29:46.549
As I said on the phone,

29:46.760 --> 29:51.675
Sebastian lost his eyesight
in an accident three months ago,

29:51.880 --> 29:56.271
and it's taking time
for him to adapt.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.836
Since the accident
he's been very angry.

30:00.520 --> 30:06.072
We want to find someone who doesn't
irritate him as much as the others.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.236
Do you understand?

30:08.440 --> 30:12.558
I can't make any promises.

30:12.760 --> 30:16.719
I mean, I've never worked with blind
people before. Did I spit on you?

30:16.920 --> 30:20.833
Don't worry. Why don't you
go out and introduce yourself!

30:21.040 --> 30:24.874
- Now?
- Yes. Take the cookies.

30:45.280 --> 30:49.558
What is it!? I said you don't
have to come here all the time.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.594
Call my cell or just shout
from the kitchen. I'll hear you.

30:53.800 --> 30:58.316
Hi, I'm Mia. Your mom told me
to come and introduce myself.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.397
She did?

31:04.600 --> 31:07.273
She gave me some cookies.
Want some?

31:07.480 --> 31:11.758
No, I don't eat fast carbs.

31:34.840 --> 31:39.755
- You're not going to offer to help?
- Well, I assumed you'd ask.

31:42.160 --> 31:46.597
Cool, a Patek Aquanaut!
Oh, you have a Panerai too!

31:46.800 --> 31:49.758
Two, actually. You like watches?

31:50.640 --> 31:54.110
Yeah. My grandpa had
a watch store in the old town.

31:54.320 --> 31:58.791
He worked there till he died in April
'94. The same day as Kurt Cobain.

31:59.000 --> 32:05.473
Not that they had anything in common.
Except heroin addiction, of course.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.516
Grandpa used to say you can tell
a lot from a person's watch.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.631
He said that?

32:11.840 --> 32:16.197
But he never wore one.
He didn't want to be judged that way.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.549
- Clearing out CDs?
- Looking for a song.

32:20.760 --> 32:24.799
- I don't remember the name or artist.
- That could take time.

32:25.520 --> 32:30.640
How about I read the names and make
"definitely not" and "maybe" piles?

32:30.840 --> 32:32.671
Then you just have to listen
to the maybes.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.672
- Okay

32:35.080 --> 32:37.275
So, what have you got?

32:37.480 --> 32:40.836
- Could it be Robbie Williams?
- No.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.718
- Per Gessle?
- No, it's not Swedish.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.798
That makes things easier.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.871
Engelbert Humperdinck?
You have eclectic taste.

32:54.080 --> 32:56.958
No, it's not Engelbert.

32:57.160 --> 33:01.278
- Oh, Backstreet Boys?
- No, they...

33:01.480 --> 33:05.917
- I've got a Backstreet Boys CD?
- You sound worried!

33:06.120 --> 33:10.636
I'm just kidding, you don't.
Or maybe you do?

33:10.840 --> 33:14.515
No, not Backstreet Boys.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.117
- What are you sighing over?
- Pictures of America.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.470
- I'm saving for a road trip.
- Cool.

33:36.040 --> 33:40.113
I'm going to fly to LA,
buy a car and start driving.

33:40.320 --> 33:46.270
When I get to New York I'll sell
the car and fly back to Sweden.

33:47.240 --> 33:51.199
- The Grand Canyon looks enormous.
- It is pretty big.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.630
- Have you been to America?
- Yeah.

33:53.840 --> 33:58.152
- When?
- A few times. New York with the guys.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.275
Disneyland, Disneyworld. We went
to the Grand Canyon when I was 8-9.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.472
You had just turned 8.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.911
Sebastian screamed
for three straight hours.

34:11.120 --> 34:16.194
We were taking a donkey ride
and Sebastian wanted ice cream.

34:16.400 --> 34:22.190
We told him there was no ice cream
in the Grand Canyon, but he kept on.

34:22.400 --> 34:27.996
Finally the guide had us turn back,
saying the donkeys couldn't take it.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.509
"Donkey get nervous!"

34:30.719 --> 34:36.033
Yeah, yeah, donkey get nervous.
Donkeys are very neurotic animals.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.833
- Aren't they?
- It's common knowledge...

34:39.040 --> 34:42.510
- Why don't you two go out?
- We are out.

34:42.719 --> 34:46.759
- Okay... See you later.
- Bye!

34:49.639 --> 34:52.074
Is that bastard back?

34:52.280 --> 34:56.319
- Get it off! Get it off!
- It's gone now, calm down.

34:56.520 --> 35:00.638
I fucking hate fucking wasps!

35:05.920 --> 35:10.630
The woman grabs
the man's buttock.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.719
- Want some popcorn?
- No thanks.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.559
He touches her left breast.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.032
And two more! And lateral!

35:23.440 --> 35:27.638
- And five more!
- Stop that, I'm counting!

35:27.840 --> 35:31.355
That's great, keep going!

35:47.600 --> 35:50.433
I'll get it.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.918
Silverberg.
Hi, thanks for calling me back.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.032
It's about my son,
Sebastian Silverberg...

35:58.840 --> 36:03.356
- To the elevator?
- No, first left before the elevator.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.799
Welcome home.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.078
So I'm starting my new job
on Monday.

36:11.280 --> 36:14.875
Friday is my last day
in the store! Yes!

36:15.080 --> 36:19.596
The new catalogue is here
and the collection looks sweet.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.874
- Who's this? You have a brother?
- We miss you buddy. Call me ASAP.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.030
Hey, Sebbe, it's Oskar.
Me and Pelle

36:30.240 --> 36:34.313
just passed that Brazilian model
who tried to go down on you,

36:34.520 --> 36:40.038
in the toilet at East,
and we just had to call you.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.233
We miss you like hell. Call us!

36:44.440 --> 36:49.594
...added you on facebook in January but
you haven't confirmed my request yet...

36:49.800 --> 36:55.318
- A bit 80s with an answering machine?
- Nice if you don't feel like talking.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.751
I bet.

36:58.960 --> 37:02.919
I guess it fits the American Psycho
look you're going for here.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.998
- Were those your friends?
- Yeah.

37:06.200 --> 37:08.794
- Close friends?
- Sort of.

37:11.040 --> 37:15.716
I found a CD with a hot picture
of you on the cover. Can I put it on?

37:15.920 --> 37:20.357
- If you must.
- I must!

37:39.880 --> 37:42.758
Oh my god! I'm blown away.

37:42.960 --> 37:47.795
Your voice is amazing! I don't know
what to say, you're gifted!

37:48.000 --> 37:51.834
The lyrics sucked,
but feel my goosebumps!

37:52.040 --> 37:53.917
- The lyrics?
- Feel!

37:54.120 --> 37:58.830
- What about the lyrics?
- It's like a 90s boy band song.

37:59.040 --> 38:02.350
- Such a great voice!
- Thanks.

38:03.280 --> 38:08.035
- Who wrote your songs?
- I did.

38:10.320 --> 38:14.438
Oh... Well, maybe
I didn't really get the lyrics.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.757
What's it about?

38:18.840 --> 38:22.037
Um, well, it's, you know...

38:22.240 --> 38:26.711
You're walking down the street,
you see a girl. She's hot.

38:26.920 --> 38:32.597
You think okay. You know.
She's dressed hot. You think okay...

38:33.520 --> 38:36.193
Sort of...

38:37.080 --> 38:40.959
You have to dare to put yourself
out there when you write.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.995
Let yourself be vulnerable.
Dare to show your feelings!

38:46.200 --> 38:49.829
Without feelings
the words are empty.

38:51.760 --> 38:56.390
Write about heartbreak,
about rejection.

38:56.600 --> 39:00.275
It has to be personal, specific,

39:00.480 --> 39:05.634
from the heart, like Coldplay,
or David Gray.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.910
Or Paolo Nutini!

39:18.240 --> 39:23.360
- Cut that out!
- You have to feel...

39:23.560 --> 39:28.714
...the magical pain of life!
- What romantic bullshit.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.673
Magical pain? Come on!

39:33.360 --> 39:37.239
What? You never had your heart
broken? Been rejected?

39:38.120 --> 39:40.475
Never been in love?

39:40.680 --> 39:43.433
- Ached for someone?
- No, not really.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.393
What have you been doing
all your life?

39:46.600 --> 39:49.592
I'll tell you some other time.
Can I ask you something?

39:49.800 --> 39:54.999
Are you a one-piece girl
or a bikini babe?

39:55.840 --> 40:00.675
- I sunbathe naked on private jetties.
- Oh yeah?

40:05.680 --> 40:08.558
You liar!

40:09.520 --> 40:13.069
NOW you dare all of a sudden!

40:14.760 --> 40:19.197
Here come two super-skinny chicks
with pouty lips.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.039
One has a big-eared rat
on a string.

40:25.920 --> 40:30.789
Oh wow. Two very elegant businessmen
right behind you.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.470
- Not bad. But something is wrong.
- What?

40:34.680 --> 40:41.279
One of them walks funny. I bet
he's just had a sack and crack wax.

40:41.480 --> 40:46.156
Oh, he's itchy.
He may have lost some skin.

40:46.360 --> 40:50.239
- More, more!
- We have a cougar, could be Russian.

40:50.440 --> 40:56.117
With a real Playboy bunny body.
Oops, her heel is stuck in the grate.

40:57.400 --> 41:02.872
She's struggling, she's about to fall
- and someone comes to the rescue.

41:05.120 --> 41:09.079
You're crazy.
You're making this up!

41:09.280 --> 41:13.319
- No, I swear!
- Playboy bunny body...

41:15.240 --> 41:20.439
- Do I have something in my teeth?
- No.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.154
When will you learn
to trust me?

41:24.000 --> 41:28.118
I won't let you go around with
food on your face or your fly open.

41:28.320 --> 41:34.395
- You might not notice.
- I notice most things.

41:36.840 --> 41:41.152
- You're so vain!
- I just don't want stuff in my teeth.

41:41.360 --> 41:45.273
- Ice cream?
- Ice cream... That sounds good.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.670
The bench is here.

42:03.640 --> 42:08.430
Hi! Excuse me, have I seen you
somewhere before?

42:08.640 --> 42:13.191
- I don't think I've seen you before.
- Are you sure?

42:13.400 --> 42:15.994
- Yeah...
- But I'm sure...

42:16.200 --> 42:21.433
- Where do you hang out?
- Where don't I hang out?

42:21.640 --> 42:24.393
- Maybe it was at the terrace at F12?
- F12, maybe!

42:24.600 --> 42:29.754
- By the way, I'm Sebastian.
- Lisa. Nice to meet you.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.794
- What are you doing tonight?
- I'll probably go out.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.279
- Maybe we can meet up?
- Wow, pushy!

42:39.480 --> 42:44.600
Why don't you put your number
on my phone?

42:44.800 --> 42:48.509
Write: "Lisa with the pretty hair."

42:48.720 --> 42:53.794
- You have a lot of Lisas?
- There's Lisa with the ugly hair too.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.710
There. Your phone.

43:01.920 --> 43:05.356
Oh! I keep it in my back pocket.

43:05.560 --> 43:09.678
Actually the other one. Thanks.

43:09.880 --> 43:14.556
- See you.
- I'll be in touch.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.511
Here's your ice cream.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.109
Who was that?

43:24.320 --> 43:28.359
- You saw her? Was she hot?
- You don't know her?

43:29.520 --> 43:32.592
- What was she doing?
- Nothing. Was she hot?

43:32.800 --> 43:36.270
She was a typical...

43:37.680 --> 43:40.353
She was average height.

43:43.400 --> 43:47.678
Thin - not creepy thin,
but a fairly straight figure.

43:47.880 --> 43:50.713
She had a friendly face,

43:50.920 --> 43:55.914
thick eyebrows, natural brown hair
and hazel eyes. What's so funny?

43:56.120 --> 44:00.716
You were so observant! Doesn't
sound like anything for me anyway.

44:00.920 --> 44:04.356
- Why not?
- Just doesn't sound like any fun.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.870
So, what do you look like then?

44:12.640 --> 44:15.154
Looks are important to you,
aren't they?

44:15.360 --> 44:22.436
They're important to everyone. Those
who deny it are either lying or ugly.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.712
In which case they're not
in a position to be picky.

44:25.920 --> 44:30.835
- Come on, what do you look like?
- How do you think I look?

44:31.040 --> 44:34.953
In my head you're... fit,

44:35.160 --> 44:41.793
with fine features, perfect taste in
clothes... and I'm thinking blonde

44:42.000 --> 44:47.358
with blue eyes. Like a shorter
version of Cameron Diaz. Am I close?

44:49.000 --> 44:53.915
- Pretty much...
- I'm so good at that!

44:54.120 --> 44:57.112
Here comes a wasp!

44:57.880 --> 45:00.872
What! Is it on me?
Take my ice cream! Take it!

45:01.880 --> 45:05.714
- I shouldn't have had any ice cream!
- It's gone now.

45:09.400 --> 45:14.713
- Do you like TV talent shows?
- Not a fan, why?

45:14.920 --> 45:20.233
There's a new one coming this fall
and I thought you should audition.

45:20.440 --> 45:24.035
- Forget it!
- Why not?

45:26.080 --> 45:29.390
Sebastian Silverberg,
the Blind Singer?

45:29.600 --> 45:33.309
It'd be like that armless guitarist
on YouTube. Forget it!

45:38.040 --> 45:43.831
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Fine. The saving is slow.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.316
You're so cheap,
it ought to go quickly.

45:47.520 --> 45:51.752
- I'll get there eventually.
- Of course you will.

46:00.640 --> 46:05.191
That's good! But how about
"All alone - where are you" instead?

46:05.400 --> 46:10.030
- That would work.
- Okay, then go into...

46:10.240 --> 46:16.236
The bridge, followed by
the new chorus.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.193
From the top.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.829
Good!

46:43.040 --> 46:47.636
- I ought to be getting home.
- What time is it?

46:47.840 --> 46:52.197
- 1:30.
- That's practically breakfast time.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.836
There's no point in going home
before breakfast.

46:56.040 --> 47:01.990
- And we have 15 verses to write.
- Okay, let's do that.

47:45.080 --> 47:51.952
Send in your audition demos to
our new talent show, Star Struck!

47:52.160 --> 47:54.674
Sebbe...

47:55.880 --> 48:01.159
I may have accidentally sent
your demo to the show...

48:01.360 --> 48:06.150
- Accidentally?
- Don't be mad - you're so good!

48:06.360 --> 48:09.511
Especially since I've been helping
with the lyrics!

48:09.720 --> 48:13.269
- I'm not doing it.
- Just see if you get an audition!

48:13.480 --> 48:17.109
I'm not going on one of those shows.

48:17.320 --> 48:23.873
- A bad attitude doesn't suit you.
- But everything else does!

48:25.240 --> 48:27.674
Stop it! That drives me crazy!

48:27.880 --> 48:31.998
What's that? I can't hear you
through a mouthful of chips.

50:13.240 --> 50:15.913
Sebastian!

50:20.480 --> 50:24.393
- It's your parents.
- Open up, throw us the key!

50:24.600 --> 50:29.310
- Call the police.
- Sebastian! Fantastic news!

50:29.520 --> 50:34.389
- What?
- They've decided to operate!

50:34.600 --> 50:38.195
- What?
- They want you there tomorrow!

50:38.400 --> 50:41.870
- I'm going to have?
- Yes!

50:42.120 --> 50:45.192
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

50:48.440 --> 50:53.070
- I can't find my toothbrush.
- I'll try to find it.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.509
I thought you could
hold on to my watch.

51:20.720 --> 51:26.477
- Can I put it in my bag?
- As long as you don't scratch it!

51:32.560 --> 51:35.199
I need to tell you something...

51:35.400 --> 51:39.916
Hi there.
It's time for a little sedative.

51:40.120 --> 51:44.591
Ah, nice.
What did you want to say?

51:44.800 --> 51:48.236
Oh, nothing.

51:48.440 --> 51:51.591
- I should go now.
- Okay.

51:53.880 --> 51:58.829
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.159
Mia?

52:14.600 --> 52:19.116
- See you soon.
- See you.

53:04.200 --> 53:05.553
Mia?

53:05.760 --> 53:09.958
Sebastian! Mia had to go.
She'll be back tomorrow.

53:10.160 --> 53:15.075
- You look beautiful, Mom!
- Oh, darling!

53:16.520 --> 53:22.231
- Everything's all right now.
- You look good, too, Dad!

53:22.440 --> 53:27.150
Hi, it's Mia
Hi, Sebbe!

53:31.400 --> 53:33.516
Hi!

53:39.120 --> 53:41.429
Hi, Sebastian...

53:41.640 --> 53:45.189
It's me, Mia!

53:46.960 --> 53:50.999
Hi, Sebbe, it's me!

53:57.360 --> 54:01.592
Hi, Sebastian, it's me, Mia!

54:01.800 --> 54:04.394
"You're borderline", she says.

54:04.600 --> 54:09.196
I said, "Finish your course
before you start diagnosing people."

54:09.480 --> 54:13.553
It's impolite, just because
you're studying psychology.

54:15.720 --> 54:19.156
Hi...

54:19.360 --> 54:23.751
- I can come back later.
- No, no, come in!

54:35.520 --> 54:40.548
- So this is Mia?
- This is her.

54:40.760 --> 54:46.312
- I guess I don't look like...
- Don't worry about it.

54:47.160 --> 54:52.678
- Erik, Mia - Mia, Erik.
- I brought you some chocolates.

54:52.880 --> 54:56.395
- Hey there.
- Hi, I'm Mia.

55:03.280 --> 55:07.319
- How are you? How do you feel?
- Well...

55:07.520 --> 55:11.559
Everything's brighter
and more colorful.

55:11.760 --> 55:17.312
Dad looks fatter and Mom looks older.
Don't tell them I said that!

55:24.920 --> 55:29.835
I heard you get to go home on
Wednesday. What will you do first?

55:34.400 --> 55:39.997
I'm going to go back to my old life.
Like it was before the accident.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.916
- Hi!
- Hey! Great to see you!

56:45.560 --> 56:47.994
Cheers!

57:26.240 --> 57:29.869
Hi, Sebastian, it's Mia.
Sorry you couldn't meet me yesterday.

57:30.080 --> 57:34.437
I'm working all week, but maybe
we can go for a walk on Friday?

57:34.640 --> 57:38.349
- Everything all right?
- I'm fine.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.629
- How are the road trip plans going?
- Great. In fact...

58:07.840 --> 58:11.310
- I'm sorry. Can I take this?
- Sure.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.432
Hey! Lobster!

58:15.240 --> 58:20.394
Yeah, great. I was wondering if
it's okay if I bring three friends?

58:21.840 --> 58:23.558
Great!

58:23.760 --> 58:28.151
No, just put them under my name.
Okay, see you later. Bye.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.112
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

58:30.320 --> 58:34.711
- Sebbe! Hi!
- Hi! Jessica.

58:34.920 --> 58:38.037
- You remember Kristina?
- Of course.

58:39.280 --> 58:43.671
- Erik told us what happened.
- It must have been awful!

58:43.880 --> 58:48.396
Yeah, it was... difficult,
but I've moved on.

58:50.840 --> 58:56.836
Sorry, this is Mia, an old friend.
- This is Jessica and Kristina.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.554
- Are you going out tonight?
- Yeah.

58:59.760 --> 59:05.039
- Sweet, maybe we'll see you.
- I'm sure we will.

59:06.360 --> 59:10.399
- Nice girls.
- Yeah.

59:10.600 --> 59:16.118
- Want to get some ice cream?
- I don't really have time.

59:18.600 --> 59:23.037
- Have you written any music lately?
- No, I haven't felt like it.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.958
- Don't give up! You're so talented.
- I know.

59:31.080 --> 59:35.517
Is that really the kind of girls
you like hanging out with?

59:35.720 --> 59:39.679
- What's wrong with them?
- I just thought you'd be...

59:39.880 --> 59:44.271
That I'd be... what?

59:44.920 --> 59:48.595
Honestly, Mia,
you don't know me.

59:48.800 --> 59:54.079
You knew me when I was a different
person. I'm grateful for your help.

59:54.280 --> 59:59.513
- But you have no idea who I am now.
- How can you say that?

59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.349
Are you mad that
I don't look like that?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.269
- I don't care what you look like.
- Okay...

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.555
- But it is weird that you lied.
- Well, I knew you liked Barbie dolls.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:19.073
- That says more about you than me.
- What do you mean by that?

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:25.310
You lied about your looks and you
liked me better when I was helpless.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.195
Now that I can see, you suddenly
have a problem with me.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.872
I just wonder what happened to you.
We laughed at stupid girls like that.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:37.913
No, I laughed at you
laughing at "stupid girls like that".

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.398
- You're obsessed with them. Drop it.
- You drop it! What's your problem?!

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.948
When will you dare to take a chance?
Go for your dream - you're so close!

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.995
Get a life! Find a handicapped
boyfriend if it turns you on.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.111
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:01.715
I just want you to succeed because
you're so good. Because I care.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.230
- Thanks. That's great.
- What do you mean "great"?

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.519
- You'd rather be with one of those...
- Go on, what?

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.840
- You know what I mean!
- Yes, I would. Totally.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.271
- You're a blind idiot!
- Nope, I'm not blind.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.040
- Then open your eyes!
- Have a nice life.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.390
You too!

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.836
- It's all I have.
- You have Maria and the kids.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.034
This is the only hobby I have.
I don't have anything else.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.679
Hi, are you looking
for anything special?

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.752
'Hi awake? '

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.633
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.956
You know what? This isn't
a very nice way to treat people.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.476
- It's fucking immature.
- I'm going to my grandma's funeral!

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.468
Yeah, yeah.
Your grandma dies often, doesn't she?

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.470
You don't even remember
sleeping with me before. Incredible.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.717
Bye. Say hello to grandma!

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.356
I thought she'd take a hint,
but she calls me crying,

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.237
says she broke up with her boyfriend
for me, and I was like, why?

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:22.592
Women. Why are they so emotional?
So much drama!

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.438
- Sebbe?
- Huh?

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.270
- Don't you get tired of this shit?
- What shit?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.950
I can't be bothered.
I'm going home.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.550
- Who's going home?
- Sebbe, apparently.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:46.711
- Come on, Sebbe! You've changed.
- Cool it. Don't be so emotional.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.708
- So much drama!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.072
- Take care.
- Sebbe! Don't be so boring!

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.273
- Buy your own drinks, Oskar!
- You suck!

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.313
Loser!

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.439
Sebbe?

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.038
Oh! Excuse me?

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.550
- Do you ever see Mia?
- No, not for a while.

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.197
Such a nice girl.
Pretty and sweet and ambitious.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.793
- You're not in touch at all?
- We don't hang in the same circles.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.675
But you two seemed so close.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.759
We didn't have much choice.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:45.358
She was here yesterday with a letter
for you. In the drawer.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:09.675
- Is this it? Nothing else?
- No, that's all.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.437
Thanks.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:56.279
Can you tell us something about
yourself that's not on the form?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.828
Like what?

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.392
Something that makes you
different, or special?

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.033
Let's try an easier question. When
did you decide to become an artist?

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:25.078
I remember it was on my brother
Theo's eighth birthday.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:28.555
When all the kids had gone home,

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.752
Theo and I went upstairs
to play with his presents.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.397
He'd gotten a Millennium Falcon
space ship,

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.879
plus all the Star Wars action
figures, and I was super jealous.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.435
We were playing and MTV was on.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:53.193
And it was Tracy Chapman
with the live version of Fast Car.

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:58.349
And I remember
we both just stopped playing,

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.870
all at once, and looked at the TV.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.472
I saw how fascinated he was.
I was only six,

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:15.312
but I thought to myself, "This is
what I'm going to do with my life."

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.957
I begged Mom to buy me a guitar,
and she did.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.789
Then... Theo got sick that summer.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.833
He died six months later.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.352
So he never got to see...

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.071
...that I kept practicing.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:42.553
Apart from Theo, music
is the only thing I've ever loved.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.871
- You have one new message.
- Hi, Mia, it's Sebastian!

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.034
I guess you're working.

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.314
I just wanted to say I auditioned
for Star Struck today and I made it.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.478
I'll be on TV on Saturday, live.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:12.916
So I just want to thank you for
sending in my demo and everything.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.396
Oh, I have another call.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:22.277
I miss... Take care,
and thanks a million again. Bye.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.032
Hi, Mom!

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.756
No, not much.
I'm going to be on TV on Saturday.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.994
It's almost time for the show
you've been waiting for all summer.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.590
Sweden's biggest talent show...

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.989
It's extremely important
that you're on time.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.279
- Nervous?
- Nah...

01:11:56.480 --> 01:12:00.314
I'm sure it's going to go great!

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.318
Screaming psychos, alcoholic mothers,
cut-up junkies...

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.353
All of them come before me!

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:28.956
Our next talent is
a guitarist and singer.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.720
All the way from Ãstermalm...

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:38.519
- Are you married?
- No, but I'm banging your wife.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.392
She's unclean!

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:45.515
...that you'll want to hang with.
A big hand for Sebastian Silverberg!

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.155
- Quiet, quiet, Sebastian's on!
- Come on, son!

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.352
That was Sebastian's twist
on Robyn's Hang with Me.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.473
- Over to you, Josefin.
- What can I say? You were awesome!

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.511
Thanks.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.871
- Lars?
- Powerful. Very good!

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.312
I just hope people vote for your
voice, not your good looks!

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.110
- He was wonderful!
- Wasn't he!

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.711
To vote for Sebastian Silverberg,
dial 08-205080.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.753
- Did you call from both phones?
- Yes, I have both!

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.078
Every vote counts!

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:34.119
The next act is from PiteÃ¥: Marie
StrÃ¥hle and her dogs Mini and Bobo!

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.511
Dancing dogs may have been
entertaining before TV and X-boxes...

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.951
- Watch it!
- Look where you're going!

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.438
No freak show act will win.
Forget them.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.235
- So the acrobat girls?
- They're out.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.398
- But their acrobatic skills could...
- They're at least 40!

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.354
- Sebbe! We voted for you!
- We want you to win!

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.155
- Can we have your autograph?
- What are your names?

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.352
Whoa... Johanna, Elin, Irma?

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.551
Stand straight!

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.751
Thank you, dear.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.317
- So that's your friend?
- More an acquaintance.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:35.193
He must be the most handsome man
I've ever seen!

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.836
Unfortunately, he thinks so too.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.670
- I say no.
- That's a no.

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:57.829
- That was embarrassing.
- And I'd like to say no.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.115
I hope you vote for this group!
That was great!

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:20.916
- Sure, I can sing at your place.
- Oh, please do!

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.555
I have a flight to LA
via London on the 19th.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.436
- It leaves at 6: 15 AM, is that OK?
- I'll check.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.756
- Is it okay?
- Oh, I just...

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:20.598
I... no... You know what,
I don't think I'm ready to book yet.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.878
- What do you think?
- I think you should go!

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:30.992
Yes, you're right. Book it!

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.756
One, two, three, four
and one, two, three.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:42.715
- Together, and "Baby" and...
- I'm sorry... this doesn't feel...

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:46.117
The steps, "Baby"...
I can't even see the camera!

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:51.235
It's okay, honey, that's why we
rehearse with the cameraman.

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:57.037
You do your thing and let him work on
staying out of the way. From the top!

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.599
With his unique version of
the Marina and the Diamonds song,

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.270
Sebastian Silverberg
with I Am Not a Robot!

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.352
Those are his parents!
They're so sweet!

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.870
Tell me when you see his friends.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.510
- Has he stopped calling?
- No, he's called a few times.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:33.111
- What did he say?
- I haven't answered.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.639
Quiet!

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.832
- He's a partier - is he hung over?
- No, that's not it.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.836
Keep it going!

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.995
My god...

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.998
Good work!

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.478
As usual, we start with the judges.
Lars, over to you!

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.430
- Are you still in the running?
- Just barely.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.838
- Tell me when you see my hand.
- Now.

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.035
- I'll call the doctor. We'll go...
- I've already seen him.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.830
They're doing all they can.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.356
- Sebastian!
- Sebastian, can I get a picture?

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.236
What happened last week, Sebastian?
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.193
That was fine.

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.479
- How is Sebastian's vision?
- He says it comes and goes.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.631
- Will he tell the truth?
- I don't know.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.231
He doesn't want it
to come out until after the final.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.319
He's afraid it will
affect the voting.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.669
- How are you?
- I'm okay. It's harder for GÃ¶ran.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:22.156
It's hard to see
his son hurting, after...

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.559
- Sebastian told me about Theo.
- He did?

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:33.915
He hardly ever talks about him. It's
great that he's begun to open up.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.794
You've done wonders for him!

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.029
Shit!

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.119
Accept it, you're useless.
You'll never beat my high score.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.552
That was a great melody.
Nice lyrics.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:02.878
- Is it about anyone special?
- You, of course! Gimme that.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:08.518
- Can you see well enough to play?
- Well enough to beat you!

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.508
Hi, it's Sebastian.
Leave a message after the sound.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.109
Hello, this is Walter Bergman
from the evening news.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.519
We've learned that you're losing
your sight after a brain hemorrhage.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.033
The story will be on the front page.
Call me if you have any comments.

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.358
My number is 08...

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:40.318
Hi Sebastian, this is Stina
from Gossip magazine. Would you...

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.633
Hello.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.038
- Hello, hi... how are you?
- Fine.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.751
- I didn't expect you to answer.
- I know...

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.909
Look, I know I owe you a massive
apology for the last time we met.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:43.715
I acted like a total ass.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.072
- Hmm, so how are you?
- Pretty good. I...

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.911
I'm okay.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.510
Can you believe the record label
wants me back!

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.874
- Really? Will you sign with them?
- Nah.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:12.029
I think I'll wait for an indie label
that lets me write my own stuff.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:19.716
Aren't you going to sing any
of your own songs on the show?

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:25.756
I could, but I don't know.
Time has just flown by and...

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:33.116
- Not everyone is as brave as you.
- Brave? I don't know about that.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:41.271
- Do you want to come tonight?
- To the final?

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.832
- Well, I'm leaving in the morning...
- Yeah? Wow!

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:54.273
- To America?
...and I'm still packing, so...

01:25:55.280 --> 01:26:00.354
I can ask them to reserve a seat
for you in case you change your mind.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.313
Okay...

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.914
I'll let you go now.

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:12.079
I hope your road trip is awesome.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.512
- That it's everything you hoped.
- Thanks.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:20.110
- Well, bon voyage.
- Bye.

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.756
"Bon voyage"?

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.117
After ten exciting weeks
following ten unique talents,

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:07.270
hand-picked from thousands of
applicants, it's time for the final.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.870
- 30 minutes, Sebastian.
- Sure...

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:25.358
- Do you need anything?
- No, I'm fine.

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.032
Wait - there is something
I could use some help with.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.240
I will! Maybe not right when I land,
but after a few days.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:01.595
Hi, Mom. Yeah, he told me.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:09.069
Can I call you back?
- What are you doing here?

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.673
I had to see you. I didn't want you
to leave without a proper goodbye.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.758
Well... Bye then.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:23.159
I have to finish packing.
So I can go "get a life", right?

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.953
- And you need to get back!
- But...

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:34.077
I'm so sorry for how I treated you.
Seeing you after the operation...

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:37.716
...reminded me of the accident
and how terrible I felt then.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.113
I mean... when I got to know you
in all that time we spent together,

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.676
You made me feel things...

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:50.678
You know, things
I'd never felt before.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.829
Like... before I met you,
I felt like a Swatch on the inside,

01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.157
but like a Patek Philippe
on the outside.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.511
- You're talking about watches now?
- I mean...

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:08.636
My lyrics! You know how they were,
but you made me feel the opposite.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:12.549
More like Coldplay
than Lady Gaga, you know?

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.918
You made me feel...
You make me feel like...

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.828
Instead of:

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:37.315
That's what I wanted to say.
And also... I'm sorry.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.634
I'm sorry.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:53.159
- Come on, let's go to the final.
- Screw the final.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.156
Hello and welcome
to the grand final!

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:03.079
A big hand for the hip hop
dance group Rhythmic Soul Crew.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:38.113
- Shit...
- Where the hell have you been?!

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:42.108
Take a seat in the front there.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.599
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:50.555
- God, I'm still in my pajamas!
- You're so embarrassing!

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.748
Go!

01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.393
Let's hear it for the gravity-defying
dancers of Rhythmic Soul Crew!

01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:21.950
It's time to introduce the man
who's made big headlines this week.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.516
Let's give a big hand
for Sebastian Silverberg!

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.152
- Hi, Sebastian.
- Hi.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.670
I love you, Sebbe!

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:54.512
- How are you?
- I have major butterflies right now!

01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:00.590
I'll bet. Before you perform,
I thought I'd give you the chance

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.510
to comment on all the rumors
circulating the past few weeks.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.280
Okay, uh...

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:14.390
It's true, I'm losing my sight.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:23.310
My journey hasn't been all that easy
this past year.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:28.753
But I guess, even if...
even if you face tough times,

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.476
you just have to take a chance
and try your best.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:40.279
That's what helps you write
interesting lyrics, right?

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.276
It gives me great pleasure
to present,

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:53.918
for the first time with one of his
own songs, Sebastian Silverberg!

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:12.557
I'd like to dedicate this song to
those who are starting new journeys.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.197
And tonight I can see.
Tonight I can see everything.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.313
