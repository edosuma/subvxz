WEBVTT

00:23.648 --> 00:25.066
So, you ready?

00:26.526 --> 00:27.777
I'm ready.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.155
Big day is coming.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.825
Jury is a mixed bag
but we only need a few of them,

00:33.908 --> 00:38.872
probably women, who either love me,
impossible not to, or sympathize with you.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.957
With what you're trying
to build and accomplish.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.500
If not your path for getting there.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.002
What's our strategy?

00:44.085 --> 00:46.504
This whole shebang hangs on two words,

00:47.088 --> 00:48.631
dangerously close.

00:48.715 --> 00:53.094
When the judge gives the jury instructions
for deliberating on the crime of intent,

00:53.178 --> 00:56.598
that's the definition she'll enforce
upon them for reaching their verdict.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.349
She's going to ask them to decide

00:58.433 --> 01:01.269
if you were dangerously close
to committing a crime.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.271
Now, the lesser charges.

01:03.354 --> 01:08.151
The Beekman Hotel, the plane you borrowed,
we're fucked, there's too much evidence.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.611
The only way out of that is

01:09.694 --> 01:12.072
if the entire jury
falls madly in love with you.

01:12.155 --> 01:18.328
But Fortress, City National,
and Rachel fucking Williams,

01:18.411 --> 01:20.330
the big ones, we have a shot.

01:21.372 --> 01:22.665
We can strongly argue

01:22.749 --> 01:26.211
you were never dangerously close
to committing any of those crimes.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.506
So you're arguing I'm incompetent.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.925
At being a criminal mastermind?

01:32.008 --> 01:33.927
Yeah. That is my job.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.386
I was building a business.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.222
And that'll be part of my argument,

01:37.305 --> 01:41.184
but this isn't a business school final,
this is your actual freedom at stake.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.937
So I have to prove to them
that you were nowhere near

01:44.020 --> 01:46.940
getting any of that money
for your foundation. Okay?

01:47.816 --> 01:49.109
Okay.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.318
Any more questions?

01:50.401 --> 01:52.445
-What am I wearing?
-I don't give a fuck.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.615
I mean, the court supplies clothes.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.242
Simple but…

01:57.325 --> 01:58.868
I have a brand to consider.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.247
Also, it's different for women.
Do I need to explain this to you?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.749
-Just get me a stylist.
-You're nervous.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.044
Things feel out of your control.
I get this a lot.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.755
Best thing to do
is to look humble, wear the court clothes,

02:10.839 --> 02:12.257
let me do my song and dance

02:12.340 --> 02:15.635
about what a young,
well-meaning, little go-getter you are,

02:15.718 --> 02:17.345
and we have a chance…

02:18.346 --> 02:21.474
to convince these poor bastards
that are stuck with jury duty

02:21.558 --> 02:25.436
that you weren't dangerously close
to ripping off Rachel or these banks.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.938
Okay?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.080
<i>Danke.</i> Code.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.043
Uh-uh. You said two Cup Noodles
for ten minutes.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.963
Bring me 20 more minutes
and I'll give you four. Now go.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.850
And spread the word!

03:06.269 --> 03:07.312
Yo.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.521
Yo, yo-self.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.899
Who's your stylist hookup
who does rappers?

03:10.982 --> 03:11.941
-Natasha.
-Yeah.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.110
Oh, you thinking trial styles…

03:14.194 --> 03:18.448
I'm thinking like HBIC,
but also like young and coquette.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.576
Mmm-hmm. Like <i>Lolita</i>
meets <i>Mildred Pierce</i> but like now.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.785
You got the funds?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.245
You know I got that Daddy paper.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.415
Just because you're inside
doesn't mean you can slang it up.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.919
-Just make the connect, I'll call back.
-You mean holla back?

03:35.173 --> 03:37.091
-You okay?
-Yeah, why?

03:38.509 --> 03:40.845
You gotta send a warning text
before you call a bitch.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.806
Thought you got cancer,
or pregnant or some shit.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.016
No, I'm good,

03:45.099 --> 03:48.436
but I've got a friend in trouble,
on trial starting tomorrow.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.646
High profile…

03:49.729 --> 03:52.482
SoHo grifter? Yeah. I know.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.400
You down to style her?

03:54.484 --> 03:57.320
Hmm, so she can stiff me too? No thanks.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.322
-That's her, I'm gonna…

04:01.199 --> 04:03.618
Natasha, Anna. Anna--

04:03.701 --> 04:06.246
Natasha, hi!
Thank you so much for doing this.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.207
Look, my rate's 1,200 a day just to be…

04:09.290 --> 04:10.792
Yes! Yes. Of course.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.962
I'll get my father
to wire you the fee as soon as we start.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.130
Cool, cool, so what's the vibe?

04:16.214 --> 04:20.385
So, the photos from this trial
are going to live forever.

04:20.468 --> 04:24.555
They may actually define
my entire identity going forward so…

04:24.639 --> 04:26.099
So no pressure.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.225
Okay, I gotta drop.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.227
Okay. I got you.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.146
Let's stay classic with a modern touch.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.067
Profesh, with a young, bohemian edge.

04:36.150 --> 04:38.695
Perfect. The photographers
will be behind me

04:38.778 --> 04:42.407
for most of the trial so the backs
shouldn't be an afterthought.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.492
With me? Never.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.786
Gosh, the lighting in there.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.457
Wicked fluorescent overheads,
a strong silhouette can conquer all.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.835
Don't worry.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.670
I got you, Anna.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.714
Thank you.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.554
Here.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.395
Vivian. How are you?

05:12.478 --> 05:13.438
Um…

05:13.521 --> 05:15.773
So, uh, who else is covering my trial?

05:15.857 --> 05:18.526
How would I know? <i>The Post,</i> probably.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.070
<i>The Post,</i> obviously,
but what about <i>The Times?</i>

05:21.154 --> 05:23.239
<i>The Times? The New York Times?</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:24.657
Or the networks?

05:24.741 --> 05:27.535
I don't know how national
the interest is in this case.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.746
But you could make them interested.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.248
I'm reporting on the trial,
not promoting it.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.500
More coverage benefits you too, no?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.585
-Anna…

05:35.668 --> 05:36.919
Validates your reporting,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.964
unless you're happy
with it just being a local story.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.675
-Don't you want bragging rights?
-I'm hanging up now.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.721
You know, you should also profile Rachel,
show what a shady-ass scammer she is.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.972
Goodbye, Anna.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.648
Spodek and Associates.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.858
Todd, now.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.153
Uh, I'm afraid
he's not in right now, Anna.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.155
You're lying, Alexi.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.157
Would you like to leave a message?

06:07.784 --> 06:11.913
You know, I've met a lot
of colorful characters in here.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.582
Murderers, hitwomen,

06:14.665 --> 06:18.753
you know, I had no idea how cheap
it was to have someone killed. Did you?

06:18.836 --> 06:22.298
Like, seriously,
like the price of a knock-off Chanel bag.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.549
Can you believe it?

06:23.633 --> 06:25.426
Uh, would you like to leave a message?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.887
Tell Todd to call my father.

06:27.970 --> 06:31.724
Have him either
wire ten grand to pay my stylist

06:32.725 --> 06:34.727
or bring it when he comes for the trial.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.895
I will let him know.

06:35.978 --> 06:39.565
Oh. And, Alexi, don't lie next time.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.871
There's a little bit of Anna in all of us.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.999
Everyone lies a little bit.

06:57.083 --> 07:01.337
We are all, every one of us, inside…

07:06.217 --> 07:08.928
There's a little bit of Anna in all of us.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.138
Not me.

07:11.097 --> 07:15.143
Maybe you pad your resumé,
exaggerate on your sales pitch,

07:15.226 --> 07:17.728
toy with the filters on your social media.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.355
-Guilty.
-We all do it.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.817
Every one of us has become a brand,

07:22.900 --> 07:26.279
an image,
a lie we project out into the world.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.196
Ugh.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.990
-What?
-Nothing.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.534
-Is it good?
-Very.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.786
-Then what?
-Then what, what?

07:33.870 --> 07:37.498
Validate me. Criticize me, help me,
anything but withhold from me.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.543
-She's lucky to have you.
-She is, right?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.173
Did you just double entendre me?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.383
Have me? Do you think she owns me?

07:48.426 --> 07:49.886
-Come on, Mags.
-I just…

07:50.636 --> 07:53.890
I want to fast forward to spring break.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.310
I want sand in my toes
and margaritas in both hands.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.396
I want a family chicken fight
in the shallow end of the heated pool,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.982
and I want this trial behind us.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.318
-I want that too.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.236
Do you think that I don't want that?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.697
Oh, fuck me.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.536
Jury's going to love you. Knock 'em dead.

08:17.955 --> 08:18.873
Yeah.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, no, I'm on my way.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.199
-Baxter.
-McCaw.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.160
Who's that?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.330
Eyes and ears. A proxy for Cy.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.251
The DA's taken an interest.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.172
Did I miss anything?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.383
-Still waiting.
-Where should I sit?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.135
Team Anna is this side.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.846
Team Rachel is that side.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.558
Neff, honey, I'm Switzerland in all this.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.186
-What do you mean she's not dressed?
-The defendant is in prison garb.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.188
What's the deal, Mr. Spodek?

09:24.272 --> 09:27.567
I'm not sure
what the issue is, Your Honor.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.403
-What did Natasha say?
-She texted, she dropped the clothes off.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.655
-Why isn't she--
-Step off. Texting.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.365
In all my years,

09:34.448 --> 09:37.243
I've been held up
at gunpoint in this courtroom,

09:37.326 --> 09:38.869
but never over wardrobe.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.246
If you let me go speak--

09:40.329 --> 09:42.957
I believe the court provides
clothing for those in need.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.292
Yes. I'm aware.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.169
Another gold star
for your report card, Counselor.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.838
The defendant won't wear them.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.091
I'm going to sip
this iced coffee, Mr. Spodek,

09:52.174 --> 09:53.509
and when I'm finished,

09:53.593 --> 09:57.013
if your client
isn't dressed and before me,

09:57.096 --> 10:00.349
I'm going to be wildly, deeply unhappy.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.310
Yes, Your Honor.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.605
And don't let the jumbo size fool you.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.106
I drink fast.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.571
Get dressed.
We can't keep the court waiting.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.073
-This is insane.
-Those clothes are insane.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.783
I'd rather wear my jumpsuit.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.827
-You can't.
-Why not?

10:19.910 --> 10:22.496
Because first impressions
matter to jurors.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.041
You look way too comfortable
in a prison jumpsuit.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.501
And the judge won't allow it.
It is legally not allowed.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.338
It's a bad look in our courtroom
and could lead to a mistrial.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.174
You're making an enemy of her on day one.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.842
Every second that we delay--

10:34.925 --> 10:36.844
Then get me clothes I can wear.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.975
Put the fucking clothes on.
This is hurting you, Anna.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.103
Hurting me? I'm fine.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.194
-Tell her to wear the court clothes.
-I did.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.905
She looked at me
like I asked to fuck her in the ass.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.325
-Where are the clothes?
-Rikers. She dropped them off last night.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.410
-She have others?
-I can't reach--

11:01.494 --> 11:03.329
-Get them here.
-I can't reach her.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.915
-I think she's crashed out after--
-Wake her up.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.125
I do not work for you.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.836
This is so fucked.

11:10.920 --> 11:14.965
We've got 30 minutes before this judge
loses her fucking shit on me.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.842
-You'd better get shopping.
-Me?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.719
Y'all figure it out, I got a shift.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.807
Okay, this is… I'm in court,
I can't leave to go shopping.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.142
I can't participate in Anna's defense!

11:25.226 --> 11:28.604
That would be unethical,
crossing a line journalistically.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.106
Well, I'm a fucking guy.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.191
Can you tell me
what pantyhose or whatever--

11:32.274 --> 11:35.778
-Do you think pantyhose is going to be--
-What's wrong with that?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.154
Fine!

11:37.238 --> 11:41.033
But you will give me access
to all of the discovery in this case.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.287
Everything. Anna's phone, email,
everything the prosecution has, I want.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.915
Yes. Fuck. Whatever. Just go.

12:04.598 --> 12:07.935
-Hi, welcome to--
-Business, sweet, modest. Now.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.854
-They're right over there.
-Show me.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.531
Flats, black, size 7. Go!

12:41.844 --> 12:46.015
Vivian must have thought this was
a shoelace or a belt or something.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.309
A happy accident.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.563
But this is not
a great start for our team.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.316
I'm very underwhelmed
with our preparation on day one.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.443
We have to go!

12:58.778 --> 13:00.279
Now!

13:02.198 --> 13:04.533
Don't crowd my entrance.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.618
-You good?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:30.911 --> 14:34.039
Thank you so very much
for joining us, Miss Sorokin.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.083
Officer, bring in the jury.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.462
On October 11th, 1944,

14:40.546 --> 14:44.925
Frank Sinatra opened
the Paramount Theater in Times Square.

14:45.009 --> 14:48.929
Women swooned
at the sight of <i>Ol' Blue Eyes.</i>

14:49.013 --> 14:50.472
They literally fainted.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.475
To the public,
this was the Sinatra effect,

14:53.559 --> 14:59.273
but in reality, it was strategically
created by Sinatra's press agents.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.192
Women were paid to swoon.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.070
And plant kisses,
and throw their clothes on stage.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.657
Ambulances and nurses were stationed
outside the theater on purpose.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.161
All because if he can make it here…

15:13.787 --> 15:14.955
he'll make it anywhere.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.918
Anna came to New York
just like some of you did.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.504
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
excited by the opportunities.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.798
A mere 25 years old.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.301
No rich parents. No connections.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.345
No fancy school pedigree.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.597
Anna couldn't
wait around for opportunities.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.391
She had to create them.
We can all relate to that.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.227
There's a little bit of Anna in all of us.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.731
Everyone lies a little bit.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.777
Whether it's on a resumé,
or a sales pitch, or on social media.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.987
We think the world
has changed with social media.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.448
Every person has become a brand.

15:49.531 --> 15:52.868
An image fed out into the world. A lie.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.414
But what was true
for Anna was true for Sinatra.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.209
Sometimes you've gotta
fake it till you make it.

16:00.292 --> 16:06.757
So, Anna followed suit
and became the person she wanted to be.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.719
A person who would receive
the red carpet from New York's elite.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.014
She allowed everyone to believe
the story they wanted to believe.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.016
It wasn't a crime when Sinatra did it.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.435
It isn't a crime now.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.813
The people you'll hear from,

16:20.896 --> 16:23.524
they wanted to believe
that Anna was a German heiress

16:23.607 --> 16:25.859
because it benefited them to do so.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.027
That's what they got.

16:27.111 --> 16:31.699
Not for one single moment did Anna
have the intent of stealing any money.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.451
Every person that walks in here

16:34.535 --> 16:37.579
and sits in that chair
wanted to give Anna money

16:37.663 --> 16:41.291
because they wanted
to be in business with her.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.961
To be close to Anna Delvey!

16:44.753 --> 16:46.296
The German heiress!

16:46.380 --> 16:49.425
Would they have wanted to be
in business with Anna Sorokin?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.845
A middle class foreigner? No.

16:52.928 --> 16:57.224
Anna had to fake it till she made it.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.518
You may judge her for that.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.728
Find her unethical.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.063
Like some would find Sinatra unethical

17:03.147 --> 17:05.357
for staging fainting women
at his performances.

17:05.441 --> 17:10.237
But it is not illegal.

17:11.155 --> 17:14.450
And the truth is,
what you need to remember most of all…

17:15.951 --> 17:20.039
the evidence will show you
that Anna was never close,

17:20.122 --> 17:24.084
let alone dangerously close
to getting these loans

17:24.168 --> 17:28.172
or stealing from anyone who gets
in that chair and tells you otherwise.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.966
Not. One. Dollar.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.346
Thank you.

17:41.602 --> 17:44.063
The Sinatra defense. Bold.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.233
One last administrative issue, Your Honor.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.444
At a later date, we will put into evidence

17:50.527 --> 17:53.113
the contents
of the defendant's cellphone and laptop

17:53.197 --> 17:55.282
as we anticipated communication

17:55.365 --> 17:57.910
between the defendant
and her various contacts.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.954
I wanted to alert you
that there have been technical issues

18:01.038 --> 18:03.373
with our IT department
due to a computer crash.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.376
And, you know, the major thing
is that most of our exhibits

18:06.460 --> 18:08.921
are in a state
where they would be presentable,

18:09.004 --> 18:12.091
the only issue that persists,
and we made it a high priority…

18:12.800 --> 18:15.260
-What's she--
-I'll ask Todd.

18:15.344 --> 18:19.306
There are two witnesses who
would testify relating to those matters.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.189
-What's wrong?
-Where is everyone?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.403
She wants to know where everyone is.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.323
Everyone? Who's everyone?

18:37.658 --> 18:38.659
The press?

18:38.742 --> 18:40.410
Her public? Whatever.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.838
Only press can take pictures in here.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.591
-You're press, you take it then.
-What's this for?

18:56.385 --> 18:59.763
I'm gonna light this whole scene
up in here. Watch me.

18:59.847 --> 19:03.392
See those photographers,
that's <i>Daily Mail, New York Post, AP.</i>

19:03.475 --> 19:06.270
They publish instantaneously.
You need pics, use theirs.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.979
The people call Alan Reed.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.316
And did you provide your services

19:52.399 --> 19:55.027
connecting her
with banks who might extend a loan?

19:55.110 --> 19:57.946
-I did.
-Did the defendant pay for these services?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.198
No.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.618
<i>And even after you kept working,</i>

20:02.701 --> 20:05.621
<i>billing all of these hours</i>
<i>above an unpaid retainer</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:10.083
<i>at $1,000 an hour,</i>
<i>were you ever able to get Anna</i>

20:10.167 --> 20:13.170
<i>close to getting a loan approved</i>
<i>or transferred to her custody?</i>

20:13.253 --> 20:14.546
<i>No.</i>

20:14.630 --> 20:18.091
Is it my client's fault
you didn't handle your business correctly?

20:29.686 --> 20:31.939
The people
call Gabriel Calatrava.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.653
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.789
She gave you a driver's
licence without her birthplace on it,

20:48.872 --> 20:52.626
and a fake trust document written
in German by her in Microsoft Word.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.128
Fake address
for her father's business abroad.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.088
That's correct.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.298
Would you say
the defendant was relentless?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.467
Stopping at nothing
to get a loan from Fortress?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.469
She was persistent, yes.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.140
Did you keep working with her

21:07.224 --> 21:09.768
because you were
interested in her romantically?

21:11.895 --> 21:12.938
Yeah. He did.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.482
Do you recall flirting with Miss Sorokin?

21:15.565 --> 21:16.858
Unfortunately.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.695
Did you tell her you wanted to kiss her?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.738
-Objection.
-Sustained.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.784
Yeah, you definitely did.

21:31.540 --> 21:35.252
A courtroom is an unexpected
venue for a fashion show,

21:35.335 --> 21:37.796
but everything about Anna Delvey,

21:37.879 --> 21:40.424
the fake German heiress
on trial in Manhattan,

21:40.507 --> 21:42.592
seems to surprise and fascinate.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.263
<i>Now Anna Delvey's courtroom wardrobe</i>
<i>has its own Instagram account.</i>

21:46.346 --> 21:48.682
<i>Who created the account? No one knows.</i>

21:48.765 --> 21:51.768
<i>But Anna's iconic outfits</i>
<i>are now must-have fashion,</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:53.812
<i>and it's all due to a celebrity stylist.</i>

21:54.521 --> 21:55.856
I know this is you.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.108
Your fingerprints
are all over this hashtag.

21:58.191 --> 22:02.571
Kacy, don't accuse me of doing
something I'm damn proud of doing.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.283
What you're doing is making it
so this poor girl has to tell her sad-ass,

22:06.366 --> 22:10.662
embarrassing story to the entire world
instead of just a jury.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.998
Anna could go to prison for 15 years,

22:13.081 --> 22:16.043
and you're worried
about Becky's 15 minutes of shame.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.337
-Stop calling me Becky.
-Okay, Karen.

22:18.420 --> 22:23.175
When are you going to wake the fuck up
and realize you're Satan's secretary?

22:23.258 --> 22:24.968
At her beck and call 24/7.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.136
Damn straight.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.306
Do you have any idea
what it takes for Anna to call me 24/7?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.726
Cup Noodles. Lots and lots of 'em.

22:32.809 --> 22:35.937
See, each inmate gets
six minutes a day of phone time.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.356
Six minutes.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.067
An impossible amount
to run a defense for a trial.

22:40.150 --> 22:44.071
So every day she hustles,
trades Cup Noodles,

22:44.154 --> 22:45.822
instant coffee, fucking tampons,

22:45.906 --> 22:48.658
whatever she can get her hands on
through the commissary

22:48.742 --> 22:50.994
or by making deals
with some scary-ass people,

22:51.078 --> 22:52.704
turns all that into minutes.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.956
Fucking hours' worth every day.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.709
That's hustle. I respect that.

22:57.793 --> 23:01.797
When you behave in a way I can respect,
drop on by my place of work and say hi.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.965
Till then, always a pleasure, Miss Karen,

23:04.049 --> 23:07.052
and good to see
you've chosen a side, Miss Switzerland.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.685
Anna has a very clear idea

23:15.769 --> 23:18.980
of what she wants
and how she present herself to the world.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.025
Hopefully, the clothes I chose
can reflect her power

23:22.109 --> 23:26.947
and force in the business world
and her strong sense of personal style.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.450
Media coverage is making
Anna Delvey into some kind of Rihanna.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.661
Some hard-working fashion icon.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.872
You're killing it in court,
but Cy will see this coverage

23:35.956 --> 23:38.458
and, from what I can tell,
they only remember mistakes,

23:38.542 --> 23:40.710
and they only reward
perfection around here.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.672
It's so unfair. We'll probably get
an earful from Baxter tomorrow.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.382
He's an irrelevant middle-man.

23:45.465 --> 23:48.468
Cy's interest will wander
to the next shiny thing after this.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.972
I'm the one who remembers mistakes
and only rewards perfection.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.515
Baxters come and go.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.852
If I lose a single count on this case,
I'll never forget it.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.645
The rest of my life.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.856
So, forget Baxter

24:00.939 --> 24:03.525
and find me
the Rachel Williams grand jury testimony

24:03.608 --> 24:05.444
I asked you about ten minutes ago.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.113
My God.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.660
I mean, Anna's got groupies.
They're starting to troll me now.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.496
It'll only get worse
when I get up on the stand. Fuck.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.956
I'll need to change my identity.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.625
Can they find where I live?
They know where I work.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.420
You're scared.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.215
-Are you a criminal?
-No.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.842
-Who is?
-She is.

24:28.925 --> 24:30.719
-Did you betray your friend's trust?
-No.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.013
Leave her high and dry
at a moment of weakness?

24:33.096 --> 24:33.930
No.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.849
-Who did?
-Anna did.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.185
-Who should be scared right now?
-Anna should.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.312
-Who should want to hide right now?
-Anna should.

24:40.395 --> 24:41.229
Amen.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.028
But still, what about…

24:49.863 --> 24:52.073
Everyone's going
to hate me after I testify.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.618
Will you hate you?

24:56.995 --> 24:58.413
Stand in your truth,

24:58.497 --> 25:02.000
fortified by kindness,
and tell your story…

25:03.543 --> 25:04.836
you bad bitch.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.263
Miss McCaw, I'm not getting any younger.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.392
-The people call Rachel Deloache Williams.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.978
D-E-L-O-A-C-H-E.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.271
Thank you.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.481
And welcome.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.568
Yes, thank you.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.570
I know this hasn't been
an easy time for you.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.490
-Where do you live, Rachel?
-The West Village.

25:33.573 --> 25:36.076
-Where did you go to college?
-Kenyon College.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.619
Why did you come to New York?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.956
I wanted to become a writer.
And to work at <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:42.791
-And did you?
-I did.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.878
How long did it take to obtain
a position there after arriving here?

25:46.962 --> 25:49.256
-Three months.
-And could you tell us how?

25:49.339 --> 25:52.425
I got an informational interview
with a woman who worked there

25:52.509 --> 25:55.637
and we seemed to hit it off,
but I didn't hear back so…

25:56.346 --> 25:59.516
I sent a hand-written
forget-me-not note with,

25:59.599 --> 26:02.310
like, this book of kind of dorky poems

26:02.394 --> 26:04.854
and a box of tea
asking her to keep me in mind.

26:05.730 --> 26:09.192
I went in and interviewed
the next day and started the day after.

26:14.072 --> 26:18.285
Miss Williams, before we go down
the rabbit-hole of your horrible hardship

26:18.368 --> 26:21.204
and struggle in your attempt
to be reimbursed by Miss Sorokin,

26:21.288 --> 26:23.039
I was hoping you'd tell the court

26:23.123 --> 26:25.292
how this experience
has affected your life.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.627
My life? Sure.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.966
Honestly, the money,
the stress she caused me with my work,

26:33.049 --> 26:35.594
and family, as horrible as all that was,

26:35.677 --> 26:38.263
I feel like
it will all pass eventually, but--

26:38.346 --> 26:39.556
But…

26:39.639 --> 26:42.142
you were close with the defendant.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.020
Yes.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.356
Is that why you trusted her,
defended her, helped her even when--

26:48.440 --> 26:49.441
I loved Anna.

26:50.650 --> 26:51.860
I was devoted to her.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.571
I was supportive,
I was a good friend to her.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.531
A very good friend, you know?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.950
So when suddenly
she became this vicious person

26:59.034 --> 27:01.411
willing to let me lose my job
and possibly go to prison

27:01.494 --> 27:06.082
for using my company card to help her
in a crisis, all for her lavish lifestyle…

27:06.166 --> 27:10.837
I honestly don't know if I'll ever
be able to trust anyone ever again.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.423
To let someone into my life ever again.

27:13.506 --> 27:17.927
Like, I hope that will change,
but I can feel how different I am now.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.512
How scared and vulnerable…

27:20.722 --> 27:23.350
Like, everything
she put me through…

27:23.433 --> 27:28.271
all the lies and stress
and betrayal, I know I can survive

27:28.355 --> 27:31.566
but I don't know if that ability
to trust will ever change.

27:33.360 --> 27:38.782
If I'll ever be myself again.
If I'll ever be able to let someone in.

27:39.866 --> 27:41.117
To love.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.249
Do you need a moment?

27:52.837 --> 27:54.255
I'm so sorry.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.093
I'm sorry.

27:59.969 --> 28:00.887
I'm okay.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.433
I'm okay. I'm okay. Please.

28:07.435 --> 28:12.941
Could you tell the jury why you chose
to monetize this awful experience?

28:14.234 --> 28:15.276
Enormous debt.

28:18.488 --> 28:22.492
But also, I found that I was kind of,
like, stuck in my head.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.620
Replaying the scenes again and again.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.332
So I thought, the only thing
to do is to get it down on paper.

28:32.085 --> 28:35.463
And it felt very important to me
that I be the one to tell my story.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.858
Don't worry,
we'll get our crack at her tomorrow.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.454
You speak Russian, right?

29:07.537 --> 29:08.538
Some.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.664
<i>Da.</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:14.502
Mr. Sorokin, this is Todd Spodek,
your daughter's lawyer.

29:21.384 --> 29:24.220
So anyway,
I'm not sure how much of the trial

29:24.304 --> 29:26.264
you've been able to catch from Germany…

29:26.347 --> 29:27.182
Um…

29:34.647 --> 29:36.441
But I'm calling to see

29:36.524 --> 29:39.235
if you've reconsidered
joining us in person.

29:44.073 --> 29:45.950
-<i>Nyet.</i>
-He says no.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.285
I got that.

29:48.119 --> 29:52.749
So Vadim, the thing is,
your daughter is a little distraught.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.877
Which isn't to say we're losing,
we're not,

29:55.960 --> 29:58.838
but given the stresses
of a trial like this,

29:58.922 --> 30:01.007
especially with all this media attention--

30:09.265 --> 30:12.101
There's really no substitute for family.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.103
She needs her family here.

30:21.778 --> 30:22.779
Please.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.077
Your own daughter?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.995
On trial in a foreign country.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.331
I am just her lawyer, Vadim.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.625
I can't be her father too.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.793
I can't do this.

30:37.418 --> 30:38.962
I can't be everything for her.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.009
He said, "Good day."

31:05.154 --> 31:06.447
Hey Viv, what did we miss?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.825
Uh, not Anna's entrance, thankfully.

31:08.908 --> 31:11.411
Missed one day of Rachel's testimony,
not missing another.

31:11.494 --> 31:15.290
-Brought you lunch…
-You can't, I can update you.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.542
Wasn't it supposed to start by now?

31:17.625 --> 31:19.294
Half an hour ago.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.463
-What's the holdup?
-Not sure. Todd's not answering.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.257
Well, did you try calling?

31:24.340 --> 31:27.510
I find it far more immediate than texting.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.847
Helicopter parenting.
Never knew what that meant until now.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.726
You've got to be kidding me. Okay.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.522
Ladies and gentlemen,
I apologize for the delay.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.692
Apparently our defendant
is refusing to join us

31:42.775 --> 31:46.738
while she sorts out
some ongoing wardrobe issues.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.366
Issues? What now?
She got exactly what she asked for.

31:51.034 --> 31:52.535
It's not what she got.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.622
But how much she got.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.665
Guess it's my turn to make the H&M run.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.667
-H&M run?
-Her turn?

31:59.751 --> 32:04.130
Oh, I just… it's just,
I… this could take a while.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.049
You guys should probably get back

32:06.132 --> 32:08.968
before Paul
gives your desks away to the interns.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.513
What is wrong with the clothes, Anna?

32:13.222 --> 32:14.933
-They're dirty.
-Then wear these.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.602
-Get me new ones.
-We can't do this again.

32:17.685 --> 32:20.480
Get me new clothes
and tell the judge I'm taking the stand.

32:20.563 --> 32:25.234
-Okay, Anna, listen--
-No! You fucked up this entire trial.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.321
I knew,
with your stupid Long Island accent

32:28.404 --> 32:29.572
and your stupid face

32:29.656 --> 32:32.325
that you would be
a useless piece of shit lawyer!

32:32.408 --> 32:34.661
-Anna, shut up and listen.
-No, you listen!

32:34.744 --> 32:36.287
I'm taking the stand. Tell the judge.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.207
Tell Natasha to bring me better clothes
or I'll fire you!

32:39.290 --> 32:40.249
What is your problem?

32:40.333 --> 32:45.713
My shitty, cheap,
fucking ugly idiot lawyer is my problem!

32:45.797 --> 32:48.383
I'm taking the stand, you incompetent ape.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.135
You fucked up this entire defense.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.720
If I needed the money,

32:52.804 --> 32:56.724
I could have had married
those rich asshole bankers!

32:56.808 --> 32:59.060
I'm trying to build something

32:59.143 --> 33:01.771
and you have completely
ruined my reputation!

33:02.939 --> 33:05.900
-Your reputation?
-That's it, you're fired! Get out!

33:05.984 --> 33:08.569
First of all, taking the stand
would be legal suicide.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.406
-Which I--
-We're done!

33:11.489 --> 33:13.658
Oh, fuck off, go find a stalker in need.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.994
Questions that make you
look more like a greedy,

33:16.077 --> 33:18.746
lying, sad-sack scammer
with a creepy fucking accent.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.748
But that's not
why you're not taking the stand.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.293
You're not taking the stand
because that's my decision, not yours.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.629
You're fired, you fucking low-class loser!

33:26.713 --> 33:29.173
-But that's still not why.
-You have no right!

33:29.257 --> 33:31.092
This may be your reputation--

33:31.175 --> 33:35.346
It's not just my reputation, asshole,

33:35.430 --> 33:38.016
it's my life. It's my freedom!

33:38.099 --> 33:41.394
You useless,
incompetent excuse for a con artist.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.855
I've known a shit-ton
of criminals in my day

33:43.938 --> 33:47.233
and you are below
fucking average at crime, so, fuck you.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.110
And fuck your reputation.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.487
And fuck your fake-ass life
and your freedom.

33:51.571 --> 33:55.491
This is my reputation, my identity,

33:55.575 --> 33:59.454
my ability to provide
a life for my family you're fucking with,

33:59.537 --> 34:03.499
and now, now I look like a fucking hack
because I can't control my client.

34:03.583 --> 34:04.917
Can't get baby dressed.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.378
I let you take the stand

34:08.254 --> 34:11.215
and it's the nail
in your coffin and in mine.

34:11.299 --> 34:15.428
You will get the maximum sentence
and no one will ever hire me again!

34:15.511 --> 34:16.929
As they fucking shouldn't.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.182
You know, fuck me, fuck you!

34:19.265 --> 34:23.394
Get out, I… my father will find me
a lawyer who isn't just some old trash--

34:23.478 --> 34:26.522
Your father? Your fucking father?

34:26.606 --> 34:28.775
You're not stupid, so what is it?

34:28.858 --> 34:30.860
Full-on fucking delusion

34:30.943 --> 34:34.238
that makes you believe
he's coming anywhere near here?

34:36.032 --> 34:38.534
Do you believe your lies?

34:41.329 --> 34:42.872
Are they for me or for you?

34:42.955 --> 34:44.040
Must be you.

34:44.123 --> 34:47.126
Because everyone else in your life
who hasn't abandoned you yet

34:47.210 --> 34:49.962
is way past believing them
and could give a fuck!

34:50.046 --> 34:51.964
So long as your checks don't bounce.

34:52.048 --> 34:55.593
Even your father
is done with this shitty act of yours.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.136
That's why your clothes are dirty.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.722
Your delusion must be on some epic level

34:59.806 --> 35:03.392
to even imagine for one second
that he would show up here,

35:03.476 --> 35:05.853
let alone pay
for a fucking fancy-ass stylist

35:05.937 --> 35:08.564
to dress you up
like a courthouse Barbie doll!

35:40.972 --> 35:42.557
The jury loved her.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.646
Fucking ate up
every spoonful of her bullshit.

35:50.982 --> 35:57.572
She's a no-talent want-to-be
trolling for fame off my back.

35:58.698 --> 35:59.866
And they loved her.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.370
They couldn't take their eyes off Rachel.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.584
But it's because she's,
she's prettier than me…

36:10.751 --> 36:11.794
more likeable.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.338
She can fit in anywhere.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.467
She's a better actress.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.727
-This is not her show.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.354
-This is our show.
-And did you see?

36:30.438 --> 36:32.356
She made them fucking cry.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.776
This is our show. You're the star.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.737
I'm the fucking, what do you call it?

36:37.820 --> 36:40.865
Loser lawyer
who gets fired in the first episode.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.159
No, not that.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.453
Costar.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.959
The one who stands by you
when no one else will.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.630
The one who never abandons you,
even when I can't stand you.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.924
Even when you treat me like shit,

36:58.007 --> 37:01.969
I still defend you to anyone
who thinks you're an asshole and a dick.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.348
Which you are.
You're a fucking dick, Anna. A huge dick.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.434
But you've also got balls.
Big fucking rhino balls.

37:08.517 --> 37:11.437
Yeah, I respect the fuck
out of those big, swinging…

37:11.520 --> 37:14.899
the kind you need to get shit
accomplished in this town.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.984
But those people, they don't see it.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.071
They see a selfish dick
who steals from her friends

37:20.154 --> 37:22.573
and fucking raids fucking hotel mini-bars

37:22.657 --> 37:25.326
like some rabid
little Russian racoon all over town.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.829
I will change that.

37:29.538 --> 37:33.084
I will expose Rachel
for the fucking hypocrite that she is,

37:33.167 --> 37:35.253
-and serve up those big, huge…
-Gross.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.129
…on a big fucking silver platter

37:37.213 --> 37:40.258
for everyone in the court
and world to admire.

37:41.008 --> 37:42.635
I will kill for you.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.595
Not because you deserve it, you do,

37:45.596 --> 37:49.183
but because I need it.
Because I fucking need it.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.269
For me.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.689
And because I can.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.775
I'm fucking down to fight.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.074
But you need to stop fighting me.

38:13.124 --> 38:18.129
I would rather go to jail forever
then come off like some wannabe.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.673
Some amateur.

38:21.257 --> 38:26.595
Some lazy millennial just looking
for a shortcut to fame and fortune.

38:26.679 --> 38:28.139
Yeah. Some Rachel.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.603
I want respect.

38:35.604 --> 38:37.898
I want you to defend me out there.

38:37.982 --> 38:42.945
I want you to defend my work,
my foundation. My achievements.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.074
My father…

38:49.201 --> 38:51.078
everyone, everyone,

38:52.121 --> 38:55.082
they have to know how close I was.

38:55.166 --> 38:59.754
They have to know that I'm not a fraud.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.216
You have my word.

39:05.968 --> 39:06.802
Get dressed.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.812
This is unacceptable
and inappropriate.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.231
I have had a jury here since 9:30.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.484
You are on trial in a criminal court.

39:21.567 --> 39:23.402
This is not a fashion show.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.488
Who in the hell do you think you are?

39:25.571 --> 39:27.073
I apologize, Your Honor.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.741
Next time, the officers will

39:28.824 --> 39:31.202
wrap you in drapes
and drag you to that chair.

39:31.285 --> 39:35.081
-You understand, Miss Sorokin?
-Yes, Your Honor.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.125
-Okay. Let's bring in the jury.

39:38.209 --> 39:41.003
We learned a lot about
your bio from your testimony.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.172
Good upbringing, good college.

39:43.255 --> 39:46.342
Landing your dream job
three months after arriving here.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.259
Wow.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.220
Congratulations on your
success as a writer.

39:49.303 --> 39:51.847
-It's enviable. We should all be so lucky.
-Objection.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.767
Ask a question, Mr. Spodek.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.062
Were you familiar
with Anna before meeting her?

39:58.729 --> 40:00.064
I saw her on social media.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.400
So fair to say you wanted
to meet her before you did.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.611
She was interesting.
Her feed was interesting to me, yes.

40:05.694 --> 40:08.406
What was interesting about her?
Or her social media feeds?

40:09.198 --> 40:11.450
Photos of art, travel,

40:11.534 --> 40:13.911
the editor-in-chief,
I guess, at <i>Purple Magazine.</i>

40:13.994 --> 40:15.788
So similar careers attracted you?

40:15.871 --> 40:18.666
Both working in fashion magazines.
Anna maybe had a leg up but--

40:18.749 --> 40:19.583
Yes.

40:20.209 --> 40:24.213
And when you did become friends with Anna,
did you ever pay for a drink?

40:24.296 --> 40:26.382
-She wouldn't let me--
-Answer the question.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.969
Not that I recall.

40:30.052 --> 40:34.348
Any of the dozens of dinners at Le Coucou
and other fine dining establishments?

40:34.432 --> 40:37.184
-Not that I recall.
-Spa treatments? Facials?

40:37.268 --> 40:39.812
Infrared saunas? Massages, nail salons?

40:39.895 --> 40:43.732
-No. Anna was very generous.
-Celebrity personal training sessions?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.651
-No.
-You never paid for any of them?

40:46.944 --> 40:49.738
And how many of these various luxuries

40:49.822 --> 40:52.908
did Anna buy for you
over the two years you hung out together?

40:52.992 --> 40:55.536
-Like what?
-Start with dinners and go from there.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.455
How many?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.375
-I don't recall.
-You didn't write them down?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.919
-No.
-How will you remember them for your book?

41:04.003 --> 41:06.338
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.718
Did you cooperate with the NYPD,

41:10.801 --> 41:15.014
with a detective to aid in the arrest
of your friend, Anna Sorokin?

41:18.893 --> 41:19.977
Yes. It was the only way--

41:20.060 --> 41:23.397
Why didn't you mention that
in your account in <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

41:23.481 --> 41:24.940
I didn't have enough space.

41:25.024 --> 41:26.734
But of all the details.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.777
You wrote about hitting the town together

41:28.861 --> 41:32.448
and nice little bonding moments
you had with Anna with beautiful detail.

41:32.531 --> 41:36.202
You didn't think the dramatic event
of setting up a sting operation

41:36.285 --> 41:39.830
to arrest Anna was worthy
of space in your article?

41:40.789 --> 41:42.166
I didn't have enough space.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.209
Mmm.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.085
How much are you being paid

41:45.169 --> 41:47.963
to write a book
about your experience with Anna?

41:49.089 --> 41:51.800
I don't know.
I don't really understand how contracts--

41:51.884 --> 41:54.428
I'm an attorney, so let me help you out.

41:56.096 --> 42:01.185
It says here you get 300 grand spread out
over four payments. Sound about right?

42:01.268 --> 42:02.102
Yes.

42:02.186 --> 42:04.772
And your TV deal, do you know
how much you're getting for that?

42:04.855 --> 42:08.943
-Or do you need help explaining it?
-I think it's around… 30,000.

42:09.026 --> 42:13.113
For the option. And then another $300,000
if the show gets made. Correct?

42:13.781 --> 42:18.035
-Correct.
-So in total, $630,000.

42:18.118 --> 42:21.288
Plus the 1,200 you got from <i>Vanity Fair</i>
for writing the article. Correct?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.625
I don't want my testimony
to be misconstrued or seen

42:24.708 --> 42:27.253
as a ploy for my own benefit
because it's not.

42:27.336 --> 42:30.673
It's not about entertainment,
it's about law and order and a crime!

42:30.756 --> 42:32.466
For you it is about entertainment, right?

42:32.550 --> 42:37.555
This is about trauma, the judicial system
in America, warning others so…

42:37.638 --> 42:38.973
This is not about entertainment,

42:39.056 --> 42:42.184
this is the most traumatic thing
that I have ever been through.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.561
I understand all that.

42:43.644 --> 42:46.855
But this traumatic experience
that you went through,

42:46.939 --> 42:49.942
you sold to three separate people. Right?

42:56.699 --> 42:57.658
I worked very hard.

42:57.741 --> 42:58.867
Answer the question.

43:01.829 --> 43:05.499
Yes, I did sell to three separate people,
but I worked very hard.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.710
And when you say
you worked very hard,

43:07.793 --> 43:10.546
you worked very hard
on befriending Miss Sorokin,

43:10.629 --> 43:12.798
by benefitting from her connections,

43:12.881 --> 43:14.258
her extreme generosity,

43:14.341 --> 43:17.678
and after one thing
that doesn't go your way, one mishap,

43:17.761 --> 43:22.850
you worked very hard on cooperating
with the police to have Anna arrested.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.104
You worked very hard on luring her
out of her rehab center in Malibu,

43:27.187 --> 43:29.189
pretending to be meeting her for lunch.

43:29.273 --> 43:33.360
You worked very hard
on your dream of becoming a writer

43:33.444 --> 43:35.821
by finding a character
and creating as juicy a story--

43:35.904 --> 43:37.489
-Objection.
-Overruled.

43:37.573 --> 43:38.449
No. This is…

43:38.532 --> 43:42.202
And you worked very hard
on selling that story

43:42.286 --> 43:46.040
of your experience with Anna
to the highest bidders, right?

43:49.835 --> 43:51.295
This is not…

43:52.004 --> 43:53.881
I wish I'd never met Anna.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.383
I wouldn't wish this on anybody.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.469
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

43:58.552 --> 44:02.056
Two years after arriving
to this city to make it as a writer,

44:02.139 --> 44:04.433
you've published
an article in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

44:04.516 --> 44:08.395
You have over $600,000 in book
and TV deals coming your way.

44:08.479 --> 44:13.484
All because you found and befriended
and turned Anna in to the police.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.611
If this is the worst thing
that happened to you,

44:15.694 --> 44:17.279
-we should all be so lucky.
-Objection.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.531
Withdrawn.
No further questions, Your Honor.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.597
You dropped a dime on Anna?

44:46.350 --> 44:49.728
Worked with the cops?
Set her up? Lured her out of rehab?

44:49.812 --> 44:51.105
Look, I can explain.

44:52.314 --> 44:54.650
-I know you're probably angry--
-This is shock.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.860
You'll know when I'm angry.

44:56.944 --> 45:00.614
I had to cooperate with the police.
It was the only way to get reimbursed.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.699
Why hide it?

45:04.034 --> 45:05.327
I was ashamed.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.579
I felt used.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.790
By the police, by the prosecutor--

45:09.873 --> 45:12.751
I feel used.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.086
By you.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.089
Thinking you're some kind of victim
in all this. Taking care of you.

45:17.172 --> 45:19.758
I am a victim in all of this.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.344
At least you'll get to cry
into all that money.

45:22.428 --> 45:26.974
Looks like you'll have plenty left over,
even after you pay Amex that 60K you owe.

45:29.351 --> 45:32.062
Unless someone
already paid that back for you.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.191
Do not withhold
from me in this moment or--

45:36.275 --> 45:39.278
Amex took care of it. They saw how crazy
this situation was and they--

45:39.361 --> 45:43.407
So you made out just fine
from dropping a dime on your friend!

45:57.212 --> 45:58.797
-Is that…
-Yeah.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.048
-Are you going to--
-No.

46:00.549 --> 46:01.633
Okay.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.137
-But what if it's--
-Lines. Boundaries.

46:06.555 --> 46:12.311
Cheers to…
your excellent cross of Rachel today.

46:12.394 --> 46:15.564
Could help with one charge,
but the other nine…

46:16.648 --> 46:19.902
Oh, Catherine's like
this unstoppable fact robot,

46:19.985 --> 46:22.070
shoveling her evidence
down their captive throats

46:22.154 --> 46:25.157
until they're so fucking full
there's no room for any of mine.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.367
So we shift strategy.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.869
Yeah, well, my best strategy

46:28.952 --> 46:32.206
that she was never dangerously close
to getting any of that money.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.249
I can't fucking use because my client

46:34.333 --> 46:36.543
would rather rot in jail
than allow strangers

46:36.627 --> 46:38.378
to think she's bad at business.

46:38.462 --> 46:42.049
-Who says you have to listen to her?
-Ethics. Decency.

46:42.132 --> 46:44.384
Whatever it takes, right?

46:45.511 --> 46:48.889
Come on.
You did great today. You got this!

46:48.972 --> 46:50.015
How drunk are you?

46:50.098 --> 46:54.186
I'm excited. We could win this puppy.

46:54.269 --> 46:58.232
Anna could be sitting right there,
on that stool, in a week's time.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.778
Anna would never be
caught dead in this place.

47:06.949 --> 47:07.950
We should go home.

47:08.700 --> 47:09.827
Probably should.

47:12.079 --> 47:12.913
Oh.

47:13.789 --> 47:17.042
Boundaries. Boundaries, Vivian.

47:19.586 --> 47:21.213
-Yes, I accept.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.799
What's up, Anna?

47:31.306 --> 47:33.350
You got a thing I don't know about?

47:33.433 --> 47:35.310
I thought you were asleep.

47:35.394 --> 47:36.228
I was.

47:37.062 --> 47:39.815
I keep thinking I'm hearing her cry.

47:39.898 --> 47:44.278
Then I wake up
and it's like ghost cries or something.

47:45.028 --> 47:45.988
Do you hear those too?

47:46.071 --> 47:48.866
What happened to all of my dresses?

47:48.949 --> 47:50.909
Fashion police
raided the place this afternoon.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.160
I should have told you.

47:52.244 --> 47:56.039
I have to get clothes to Rikers by 11:00
or they won't be there

47:56.123 --> 47:59.251
when they take her in the morning,
and it'll be another fiasco.

47:59.334 --> 48:03.547
Her? See, when I say "her,"
I mean our daughter. When you say "her--"

48:03.630 --> 48:05.924
It's just clothes, I'm just helping.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.217
Ah, there you are!

48:08.302 --> 48:12.139
If I showed a video of you
to college you right now,

48:12.222 --> 48:13.682
she would freak the fuck out.

48:13.765 --> 48:17.311
It's just a dress, Jack.
Why does this bother you so much?

48:17.394 --> 48:19.771
It's bothering me
that it's not bothering you.

48:19.855 --> 48:24.151
Of course it's bothering me.
I hate thinking about clothes.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.987
I hate being away from my daughter
and going to Rikers.

48:27.070 --> 48:28.280
Then why?

48:28.363 --> 48:30.699
Because I created this monster.

48:30.782 --> 48:33.410
Now the eyes of the world
are on her. She has no one.

48:33.493 --> 48:36.538
There are plenty of good reasons
why she has no one.

48:38.081 --> 48:40.334
I need to get this to Rikers, so…

48:42.210 --> 48:43.587
How can you even say this to me?

48:43.670 --> 48:46.006
For months, you have known
about this vacation!

48:46.089 --> 48:48.050
It's my fault
this trial is dragging on?

48:48.133 --> 48:51.845
-Nothing is your fault. How could it be?
-I can't just abandon my client!

48:51.929 --> 48:54.848
Handing off to co-counsel
is not abandonment.

48:54.932 --> 48:57.935
You haven't been there,
not once, to support me.

48:58.018 --> 49:01.563
You have no idea, with a shit-ton
of media attention, I can't just give up--

49:01.647 --> 49:04.024
-Now we know what this is really about.
-What?

49:04.107 --> 49:06.276
You wanna be there
for the press conference,

49:06.360 --> 49:08.654
so half a dozen
of your law school classmates

49:08.737 --> 49:10.697
can see your face on New York 1. Pathetic.

49:10.781 --> 49:13.700
-I could give a fuck--
-If this was a death row case, sure!

49:13.784 --> 49:16.912
Take all the time you need,
but your entire ego is riding

49:16.995 --> 49:20.540
on this spoiled little thief who is,
let us face it, guilty as all get-out!

49:20.624 --> 49:22.834
If she is a killer,
she wouldn't need me,

49:22.918 --> 49:24.294
but she's not. She's a kid.

49:24.378 --> 49:27.714
An immigrant kid, who came to this country
for the American dream--

49:27.798 --> 49:30.300
Please don't wrap the flag
around this psycho.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.094
I am all she has!

49:36.181 --> 49:39.059
You were raised on Mount fucking Olympus.

49:39.142 --> 49:41.645
You could never understand
what that's like.

49:42.729 --> 49:46.108
Please… explain it to me.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.787
-Get it, go on.
-No.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.998
Go tell Anna
how great she looked in court today.

50:01.957 --> 50:05.210
You act like I'm fucking this chick.
She's a client!

50:05.293 --> 50:07.921
I wish you were,
because it would help explain to me

50:08.005 --> 50:09.840
why you suddenly think it is okay

50:09.923 --> 50:13.218
to completely ruin
our only vacation in two years.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.062
-I have boundaries.
-She'll call again.

50:24.146 --> 50:25.063
Hello.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.358
Oh. Hi. Brian, right? Is your dad there?

50:28.442 --> 50:30.068
He's fighting with my mom.

50:30.152 --> 50:33.238
I can wait.
But not very long. I'm in jail.

50:33.321 --> 50:34.740
What did you do?

50:34.823 --> 50:37.117
Nothing, I just borrowed some money.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.827
And a jet.

50:38.910 --> 50:40.537
<i>Can I borrow some money?</i>

50:41.955 --> 50:43.415
Your dad has all my money.

50:43.498 --> 50:45.417
He won't give me any.

50:45.500 --> 50:46.460
<i>I doubt that.</i>

50:47.294 --> 50:48.420
He's a nice guy.

50:49.129 --> 50:50.714
And he loves you very much.

50:50.797 --> 50:53.300
But he's making my mom sad.

50:53.383 --> 50:55.510
<i>You can probably blame me for that.</i>

50:55.594 --> 50:58.930
<i>But you can also use that</i>
<i>to get what you want.</i>

50:59.014 --> 51:00.223
I can?

51:00.307 --> 51:04.311
Sure. People give people money
for all sorts of reasons.

51:04.394 --> 51:07.814
Guilt and love are two of the biggest.

51:07.898 --> 51:11.401
And you've got both.
You should ask for the moon.

51:12.110 --> 51:13.445
I'll go get my dad.

51:13.528 --> 51:17.365
No, don't. Let them fight.

51:17.449 --> 51:20.243
But I don't like it. It's loud.

51:21.119 --> 51:22.704
It's better than silence.

51:26.249 --> 51:29.044
Well, uh…
Brian, my time is up.

51:29.920 --> 51:30.837
Bye.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.130
Bye.

51:42.099 --> 51:45.852
When Detective McCaffrey went to look
for Anna in court, was she there?

51:45.936 --> 51:46.770
No.

51:46.853 --> 51:49.064
Did she stay to fight her charges?

51:49.147 --> 51:49.981
No.

51:50.065 --> 51:53.860
She went to California because she knew
there was no defense to these charges.

51:53.944 --> 51:57.447
She knew that she was guilty
of these charges.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.366
That shows plainly that the defendant…

51:59.449 --> 52:03.245
White for the closing arguments? Genius.

52:03.328 --> 52:04.996
…committing crimes.

52:05.080 --> 52:07.290
When you go back
to the jury room to deliberate,

52:07.374 --> 52:09.960
I urge you to come to the only verdict

52:10.043 --> 52:12.963
that is in accord
with the law and the evidence.

52:13.046 --> 52:15.048
And that is that the defendant is guilty

52:15.132 --> 52:18.093
beyond a reasonable doubt
of all ten counts.

52:19.928 --> 52:20.762
Thank you.

52:36.069 --> 52:37.362
Mr. Spodek?

52:41.074 --> 52:41.908
Todd.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.748
Remember how I told you I'd kill for you?

52:49.541 --> 52:50.375
What?

52:50.458 --> 52:53.295
Just… trust your costar.

52:53.378 --> 52:54.212
Okay?

52:58.592 --> 53:02.762
You've heard a lot of evidence
from a lot of witnesses in this trial,

53:02.846 --> 53:05.473
but have you noticed one thing throughout?

53:05.557 --> 53:09.394
Every witness who came before you
in this trial was embarrassed.

53:10.478 --> 53:12.355
They didn't want
to tell you the full truth.

53:12.439 --> 53:15.358
Every witness blamed
someone else for their mistakes.

53:15.442 --> 53:16.651
Everyone had a story.

53:17.319 --> 53:20.197
Because every one of them,
all highly paid,

53:20.280 --> 53:23.992
well-educated, experienced businessmen,

53:24.743 --> 53:27.621
every one of them
was fooled by a 25-year-old kid

53:27.704 --> 53:30.081
with no college degree, no credentials,

53:30.165 --> 53:33.293
and no business experience
beyond an internship.

53:33.376 --> 53:35.754
Anna was as green as they come.

53:35.837 --> 53:38.798
In a world where she knew no one
with no idea of what she was doing.

53:38.882 --> 53:43.220
How could she get dangerously close
to fooling these banks?

53:43.303 --> 53:44.512
To getting any of this money?

53:44.596 --> 53:46.765
Now, you may have found Miss Sorokin's

53:46.848 --> 53:50.101
behavior wrong, immoral,
unethical, unorthodox.

53:50.185 --> 53:53.313
You may love her or hate her
for exploiting the system.

53:53.396 --> 53:55.649
-But if anyone in this case…
-What is he--

53:55.732 --> 53:59.194
…is trying to remove people
from their money, it's the bankers.

53:59.277 --> 54:02.155
They will literally do anything
in their nature

54:02.239 --> 54:03.949
to get your accounts and business.

54:04.032 --> 54:06.493
Was Anna ever remotely close

54:06.576 --> 54:08.954
to getting any of these loans
from any of these banks?

54:09.037 --> 54:10.038
Never.

54:10.121 --> 54:13.041
And if she had been,
it wouldn't have gone into her pocket.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.043
It would go to the landlord
for the building

54:15.126 --> 54:16.962
she wanted to renovate for her business.

54:17.045 --> 54:20.966
But look at the evidence, and you'll see,

54:22.467 --> 54:23.969
there was no business.

54:24.052 --> 54:26.888
It was just a dream. An idea.

54:26.972 --> 54:30.308
The only thing that materialized
was a pitch deck.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.602
A few words and pictures.

54:32.686 --> 54:35.563
It was never real. Never tangible.

54:35.647 --> 54:38.483
Anna was young,
ambitious, in over her head,

54:38.566 --> 54:42.487
totally unprepared and incapable
of what she set out to do.

54:42.570 --> 54:44.572
She was never, not for one second close,

54:44.656 --> 54:46.449
let alone dangerously close,

54:46.533 --> 54:49.327
to getting this money
or building this building,

54:49.411 --> 54:52.539
or starting this club,
this art foundation.

54:52.622 --> 54:55.458
It was all talk. Hot air.

54:55.542 --> 55:00.380
A road to nowhere paved
with naiveté and good intentions.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.550
To prove she had the intent,

55:03.633 --> 55:05.885
you'd have to prove
she was dangerously close.

55:05.969 --> 55:09.597
And if you can't find her intent,
you cannot convict her of any crimes.

55:10.849 --> 55:14.102
If you have a reasonable doubt
as to her intent,

55:14.185 --> 55:15.478
her state of mind,

55:15.562 --> 55:19.190
then you must find her not guilty
on all counts.

55:22.944 --> 55:23.820
Thank you.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.574
Thank you, Mr. Spodek.

55:27.657 --> 55:30.243
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
try to stay with me.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.537
I'm going to change the tone
of my voice a little

55:32.620 --> 55:35.749
so that you will pay attention
because this is important.

55:36.541 --> 55:39.085
He tanked her. He totally tanked her.

55:40.837 --> 55:43.298
The indictment
is not evidence of guilt,

55:43.381 --> 55:44.716
it's a notice of the charges…

55:44.799 --> 55:46.885
-I had to. It was…
-…against the defendant

55:46.968 --> 55:50.013
served as the mechanism
for bringing her to trial.

55:50.096 --> 55:52.265
Throughout these proceedings,
the defendant…

55:57.062 --> 55:58.229
Hey.

56:06.654 --> 56:08.114
How long does this shit take?

56:11.034 --> 56:12.494
As long as it takes, I guess.

56:14.245 --> 56:17.332
I'm not a patient person,
so give me some mantra or some shit.

56:20.835 --> 56:24.756
God, give me the strength to accept
the things I cannot change…

56:24.839 --> 56:27.133
You made that up
or steal it from the Bible?

56:30.220 --> 56:31.137
Neither.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.224
My ex is in Alcoholics Anonymous.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.005
So ten counts against Anna, right?

57:06.506 --> 57:08.633
-Yes, Vivian, ten counts.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.596
And she could get 15 years
if convicted on all of them?

57:13.680 --> 57:16.433
You've known this… What is this? Amnesia?

57:16.516 --> 57:18.184
Early onset fucking Alzheimer's--

57:18.268 --> 57:21.062
I'm trying to distract you
so you'll stop twisting that bottle cap.

57:21.146 --> 57:23.314
It's a big hallway, Vivian.

57:29.696 --> 57:33.366
Think it's a one holdout,
<i>12 Angry Men</i> situation in there, or…

57:33.992 --> 57:36.578
Is it the legal definitions
they're struggling with?

57:38.246 --> 57:40.081
I don't even care anymore.

57:40.165 --> 57:41.249
I've done my bit.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.211
I'm getting on a plane for Mexico
in five hours. Come what may.

57:45.837 --> 57:46.671
You're leaving?

57:46.754 --> 57:48.590
Well, it's either that or divorce.

57:48.673 --> 57:49.591
So…

57:50.383 --> 57:52.802
Alexi can handle it from here.
He's more than capable.

57:52.886 --> 57:53.970
You're leaving today?

57:54.554 --> 57:56.556
-It's just a case, Vivian.
-I know that.

57:56.639 --> 57:58.600
I've abandoned my family for long enough.

57:58.683 --> 57:59.767
I get it. It's just…

58:00.935 --> 58:02.562
-Anna's a big girl.
-I know.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.314
It's not that.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.608
It's… I guess…

58:08.151 --> 58:11.237
I don't have the words,
and I should because words are my job,

58:11.321 --> 58:13.323
but the closest thing I can come up with

58:13.406 --> 58:15.366
for how I feel is that I will miss you.

58:18.536 --> 58:21.915
This is not… We'll cross paths.

58:21.998 --> 58:22.832
Of course.

58:22.916 --> 58:25.293
And there'll be other cases of interest.

58:25.376 --> 58:26.753
I mean, for sure.

58:26.836 --> 58:27.670
Right.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.383
We can go out to dinner. The four of us.

58:33.092 --> 58:34.427
Maybe five.

58:35.053 --> 58:37.138
Right. Yeah.

58:40.099 --> 58:40.934
Here's hoping.

58:56.449 --> 58:57.325
Nothing yet?

58:57.408 --> 58:58.576
Don't ask me again.

58:58.660 --> 59:00.828
Maybe there's no connection,
bad service…

59:00.912 --> 59:01.746
Viv's online.

59:01.829 --> 59:03.456
This green light tells me so.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.292
This computer thing
even tells me when she's typing.

59:06.376 --> 59:08.962
It actually tells me
Vivian is typing when she's typing.

59:09.045 --> 59:11.130
Who the fuck needs that much information?

59:11.214 --> 59:14.592
Is that supposed to ease my anxiety?
It does the exact opposite.

59:14.676 --> 59:17.845
Since Vivian's not typing,
I'm making a green tea run. Anybody?

59:18.513 --> 59:19.347
I'm good.

59:19.430 --> 59:21.391
I'll have a… a red eye.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.475
Hold it, hold it…

59:23.393 --> 59:24.644
Vivian is typing.

59:50.503 --> 59:51.337
This is it.

59:51.421 --> 59:52.463
This is it.

59:53.548 --> 59:54.882
Let's bring in the jury.

59:54.966 --> 59:57.760
Everybody, sit down! Now!

1:00:06.352 --> 1:00:08.104
-There's a verdict.
-We can read.

1:00:22.910 --> 1:00:23.745
Hi.

1:00:24.454 --> 1:00:25.705
All right.

1:00:25.788 --> 1:00:26.706
Members of the jury,

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:30.376
I understand we have a note indicating
you have reached a verdict.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:31.628
I would ask the clerk--

1:00:31.711 --> 1:00:33.463
Would the foreperson please stand?

1:00:36.674 --> 1:00:38.009
-You gotta stand up.
-Oh.

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:41.888
Is the verdict unanimous?

1:00:41.971 --> 1:00:42.889
Yes.

1:00:43.806 --> 1:00:47.101
How say you as to count one,
charging the defendant, Anna Sorokin,

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:49.646
with attempted grand larceny
in the first degree,

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:51.898
attempt to steal property
from City National Bank

1:00:51.981 --> 1:00:54.359
exceeding $1 million.
Guilty or not guilty?

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:57.320
Not guilty.

1:01:02.450 --> 1:01:03.368
Whoo!

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:05.995
Yeah! Fuck, yeah! Okay.

1:01:06.704 --> 1:01:09.540
How say you as to count two,
charging the defendant

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:12.460
with attempted grand larceny
in the first degree,

1:01:12.543 --> 1:01:14.962
attempt to steal property
from Fortress Investment Inc.

1:01:15.046 --> 1:01:16.631
exceeding $1 million.

1:01:17.256 --> 1:01:18.466
Guilty or not guilty?

1:01:18.549 --> 1:01:20.843
Come on, come on, come on, type faster.

1:01:20.927 --> 1:01:22.720
Type, Vivian.

1:01:24.472 --> 1:01:25.682
Guilty.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:27.475
Count three,
charging the defendant

1:01:27.558 --> 1:01:29.185
with grand larceny in the second degree,

1:01:29.268 --> 1:01:32.605
stolen property
from City National Bank exceeding $50,000.

1:01:32.689 --> 1:01:34.482
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

1:01:35.149 --> 1:01:38.611
Count four, charging the defendant
with grand larceny in the second degree,

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:42.532
stolen property
from Citibank NA exceeding $50,000.

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:44.909
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

1:01:44.992 --> 1:01:48.413
Count five, charging the defendant
with grand larceny in the second degree,

1:01:48.496 --> 1:01:52.375
stolen property
from Rachel Williams exceeding $50,000.

1:01:52.458 --> 1:01:53.668
Guilty or not guilty?

1:01:53.751 --> 1:01:54.961
Not guilty.

1:01:55.044 --> 1:01:58.631
Count six, charging the defendant
with grand larceny in the third degree,

1:01:58.715 --> 1:02:02.260
stolen property
from Signature Bank exceeding $3,000.

1:02:02.343 --> 1:02:04.387
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

1:02:04.470 --> 1:02:07.473
Count seven, charging
the defendant with theft of services,

1:02:07.557 --> 1:02:10.810
intent to obtain air transportation
service with Fly Blade Inc.

1:02:10.893 --> 1:02:13.104
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

1:02:13.187 --> 1:02:14.272
Beekman Hotel?

1:02:15.022 --> 1:02:15.940
Guilty.

1:02:16.023 --> 1:02:17.859
-W Hotel.
-Guilty.

1:02:17.942 --> 1:02:20.236
-Le Parker Meridien Hotel.
-Guilty.

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:34.584
Well…

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:37.587
that's that.

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:45.178
Ladies and gentlemen,
it has been a very difficult job.

1:02:45.261 --> 1:02:47.555
I understand that and I appreciate it.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:51.225
As I said,
no matter what your verdict was,

1:02:51.309 --> 1:02:53.436
you served your community well.

1:02:53.519 --> 1:02:55.271
A couple of things, all of the…

1:02:55.354 --> 1:02:58.858
Hey, we won two out of the three big ones.
That's not nothing.

1:02:59.817 --> 1:03:03.404
-No, yeah. City National and Rachel.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:03:03.488 --> 1:03:04.572
It's not bad.

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:07.742
If you wish
to speak to them, you may.

1:03:07.825 --> 1:03:11.412
I think that some members of the media
might wish to speak to you as well.

1:03:11.496 --> 1:03:15.458
Again, it is your choice
if you choose to speak with them.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:17.919
And I want to mention
something about the media.

1:03:18.002 --> 1:03:20.838
Obviously, you have
seen them here the whole time.

1:03:20.922 --> 1:03:25.218
I'm very proud of the way
you've focused on this case, not on them.

1:03:25.301 --> 1:03:27.428
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go right after this.

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:29.680
Alexi will walk you through
the next steps.

1:03:29.764 --> 1:03:31.933
I'll be back next week
to check on you. Okay?

1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:33.726
Yes.

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:35.645
Have a good vacation. You earned it.

1:03:37.814 --> 1:03:40.149
And thanks once again
for your service.

1:03:40.233 --> 1:03:41.108
Thank you.

1:03:42.944 --> 1:03:45.238
You may exit. You are discharged.

1:03:46.572 --> 1:03:49.659
-I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you. That means a lot.

1:03:49.742 --> 1:03:52.078
We should stop and pick up
sticker books for the kiddos

1:03:52.161 --> 1:03:54.288
if you want any chance
of surviving this flight.

1:03:54.372 --> 1:03:55.748
I had Gloria call the hotel

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:57.875
and sign them up for kids club
every day,

1:03:57.959 --> 1:04:01.170
so we can claim half a day
to ourselves to hit the golf course,

1:04:01.254 --> 1:04:04.006
wander into town,
spend the whole day in bed.

1:04:06.259 --> 1:04:07.093
What is it?

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:09.512
I can't go. Not now.

1:04:09.595 --> 1:04:11.931
Why? Todd, it's over.

1:04:12.807 --> 1:04:14.725
I'll come as soon as I can.

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:20.523
I don't think you understand
what you're doing right now.

1:04:21.691 --> 1:04:22.733
I do understand.

1:04:23.818 --> 1:04:25.319
I don't think you understand--

1:04:25.403 --> 1:04:28.322
She's got you parking her car, Todd.
You know that.

1:04:36.622 --> 1:04:37.623
I love you, I…

1:05:11.824 --> 1:05:12.825
You okay?

1:05:13.993 --> 1:05:15.786
You betrayed me.

1:05:17.246 --> 1:05:18.748
That's one way to look at it.

1:05:20.583 --> 1:05:23.210
I also beat two out of three
of your biggest charges.

1:05:23.878 --> 1:05:26.964
You don't have to like how I got there,
but let me explain.

1:05:27.048 --> 1:05:28.132
It doesn't matter.

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:31.052
It doesn't matter.

1:05:34.096 --> 1:05:36.974
The jury, they saw through you.

1:05:37.058 --> 1:05:42.438
They saw how close
I was to the money, to ADF.

1:05:42.521 --> 1:05:45.650
They saw through Rachel's bullshit.

1:05:45.733 --> 1:05:51.656
I… I didn't need to fuck over
my friends for 60 grand

1:05:51.739 --> 1:05:56.494
when those fucking frat boys at Fortress
were willing to hand over 20 million!

1:05:59.330 --> 1:06:05.044
Those people in there.
They… they saw me.

1:06:05.127 --> 1:06:10.424
I was dangerously close,
and they saw that.

1:06:13.260 --> 1:06:19.475
Now… now the world will know
that I am not an idiot.

1:06:19.558 --> 1:06:22.353
I'm not some dumb socialite.

1:06:27.566 --> 1:06:28.693
I'm a player.

1:06:38.285 --> 1:06:41.831
I was so… I was one step away.

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:52.383
I'll call your dad.

1:06:53.926 --> 1:06:54.844
I'll let him know.

1:07:03.519 --> 1:07:07.940
The traffic
on your original story is insane.

1:07:08.024 --> 1:07:09.567
Between the trial and sentencing,

1:07:09.650 --> 1:07:11.902
it's consistently peaking
as the top-trending,

1:07:11.986 --> 1:07:14.155
highest read ratio
of any story on the site.

1:07:14.238 --> 1:07:17.074
Globally, over four million
unique impressions.

1:07:17.158 --> 1:07:19.368
We've never seen anything like this.

1:07:19.452 --> 1:07:21.162
-Have we, Paul?
-Not in my memory.

1:07:21.245 --> 1:07:23.372
The interest in this is, well, just…

1:07:24.832 --> 1:07:26.333
We obviously need a follow-up.

1:07:26.417 --> 1:07:27.251
Absolutely.

1:07:27.334 --> 1:07:28.252
Cover story.

1:07:28.335 --> 1:07:29.754
Yeah, big splash.

1:07:29.837 --> 1:07:32.757
Get micro with it.
I want all the inside color.

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:34.258
The conflict with the judge.

1:07:34.341 --> 1:07:37.678
The whole courtroom,
this runway business.

1:07:37.762 --> 1:07:40.848
Apparently she wore white
on the day of her closing arguments.

1:07:40.931 --> 1:07:42.975
I mean, this chick's amazing.

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:45.436
Was that white dress her idea?

1:07:45.519 --> 1:07:46.771
Or the stylist's?

1:07:47.521 --> 1:07:48.355
Hey.

1:07:48.981 --> 1:07:49.940
We should move you.

1:07:50.608 --> 1:07:53.527
She needs an office.
The office next to you is free.

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:55.613
You want the office next to Paul?

1:07:55.696 --> 1:07:57.698
Don't worry about…

1:07:58.741 --> 1:08:01.786
Uh, we're going to need
art directors, photographers…

1:08:06.082 --> 1:08:08.167
-The kid, the Mexican kid.
-Who?

1:08:08.250 --> 1:08:09.085
Oh.

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:31.690
Landon offered me an office.

1:08:32.942 --> 1:08:33.984
Next to Paul's.

1:08:35.277 --> 1:08:37.154
Attagirl.

1:08:37.238 --> 1:08:38.948
I'm moving out of Scriberia.

1:08:39.031 --> 1:08:41.283
That's the goal.

1:08:47.373 --> 1:08:48.582
Vivian. What?

1:08:50.042 --> 1:08:52.837
It was mine. The white dress Anna wore.

1:08:56.382 --> 1:08:57.842
Huh. Huh.

1:08:57.925 --> 1:09:00.136
I took it out of my closet, Lou.

1:09:02.179 --> 1:09:03.013
Yep.

1:09:05.933 --> 1:09:06.767
Lou…

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:10.062
Scriberia, white dresses…

1:09:12.857 --> 1:09:15.109
You're burying the lead.

1:09:16.819 --> 1:09:18.487
I care about her.

1:09:19.530 --> 1:09:21.031
More than I should.

1:09:21.907 --> 1:09:23.909
She doesn't care about me at all.

1:09:23.993 --> 1:09:28.122
Did she care about me at all?
Was I just another con?

1:09:30.749 --> 1:09:31.959
The lead.

1:09:32.042 --> 1:09:33.752
Vivian. Huh.

1:09:39.383 --> 1:09:40.759
What the fuck do I do now?

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:44.805
You move onto the next story.

1:09:47.558 --> 1:09:48.726
That's the job.

1:10:01.906 --> 1:10:04.742
It's okay. It's okay.

1:10:21.675 --> 1:10:24.345
<i>Miss Sorokin,</i>
<i>I have no confidence whatsoever…</i>

1:10:24.428 --> 1:10:28.098
<i>None… Zero… To face the music.</i>

1:10:28.182 --> 1:10:29.934
<i>I am remanding you to Rikers Island</i>

1:10:30.017 --> 1:10:32.895
<i>for five to 15 years,</i>
<i>state prison until trial.</i>

1:10:32.978 --> 1:10:34.438
<i>Anna Sorokin,</i>

1:10:34.521 --> 1:10:38.567
<i>convicted of swindling New York's</i>
<i>elite out of more than $200,000,</i>

1:10:38.651 --> 1:10:41.570
<i>will be sentenced tomorrow</i>
<i>in a Manhattan courtroom.</i>

1:10:41.654 --> 1:10:45.032
<i>Sorokin faces up to 15 years in prison.</i>

1:10:45.741 --> 1:10:47.159
Rachel can write.

1:10:47.243 --> 1:10:49.954
-What's it say? Give it.
-Stop it. You're not in here much.

1:10:50.037 --> 1:10:50.913
Give it!

1:10:51.455 --> 1:10:53.749
Should have come to Morocco,
you'd be famous like me.

1:10:53.832 --> 1:10:55.167
How can she write so fast?

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:57.211
-She's got the trial in here.
-Give me the book.

1:10:57.294 --> 1:10:58.462
It'll be out by summer.

1:10:58.545 --> 1:11:01.799
You can read it on Jones Beach
like the other basic bitches.

1:11:15.604 --> 1:11:17.273
Here, have at it.

1:11:20.943 --> 1:11:21.944
You know what, no.

1:11:24.113 --> 1:11:27.283
I have wasted enough…

1:11:29.493 --> 1:11:30.911
I'm shooketh.

1:11:32.246 --> 1:11:35.124
I am done… living life
through the eyes of others.

1:11:35.207 --> 1:11:36.875
I am a director.

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:39.128
I'm a fucking film director, starting now.

1:11:40.254 --> 1:11:43.507
I'm going inside and giving 'em
my two weeks, right now. Watch me.

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:47.052
-Honey, wait.
-Don't try talking me out of it.

1:11:47.136 --> 1:11:48.929
Wait, Anna's sentence.

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:50.723
The judge is ruling. It's out.

1:11:51.348 --> 1:11:52.683
How long?

1:12:02.943 --> 1:12:04.194
Twelve years.

1:12:04.987 --> 1:12:05.946
Four to twelve.

1:12:07.281 --> 1:12:10.034
Twelve years.

1:12:10.117 --> 1:12:14.496
In 12 years,
my daughter will have a cellphone.

1:12:14.580 --> 1:12:15.664
Twelve is the max.

1:12:16.957 --> 1:12:19.084
In 12 years,
there won't be Arctic sea ice.

1:12:19.585 --> 1:12:23.005
-I'm not sure what that has to do--
-In 12 years, Anna will be 40.

1:12:23.088 --> 1:12:25.591
She won't be a viral sensation.

1:12:26.967 --> 1:12:28.635
She won't be an Instagram star.

1:12:28.719 --> 1:12:32.264
She won't be daughter of the zeitgeist
or queen of the millennials.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:39.772
She'll be a lonely middle-aged woman
whose life was stolen from her.

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:46.195
Todd.

1:12:46.278 --> 1:12:48.697
What? What do you want me to say?

1:12:49.865 --> 1:12:51.784
You didn't make her do the interview?

1:12:52.743 --> 1:12:53.827
You didn't use her?

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:55.704
She didn't end up
getting a longer sentence

1:12:55.788 --> 1:12:57.164
because of the media attention?

1:12:57.247 --> 1:13:02.336
Sorry, but you got more clicks,
Anna got more time. Plain and simple.

1:13:05.798 --> 1:13:06.965
How's your phone?

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:08.384
My phone?

1:13:08.467 --> 1:13:09.635
I'll bet it's ringing.

1:13:10.594 --> 1:13:11.428
Finally.

1:13:11.512 --> 1:13:13.472
Getting some new clients these days?

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:14.640
Yeah, exactly.

1:13:14.723 --> 1:13:17.393
You're about to get rich
off of this case. Enjoy that.

1:13:17.476 --> 1:13:21.021
Maybe give yourself a break. Regroup.

1:13:21.105 --> 1:13:24.358
-Maybe take your family on vacation--
-I missed my family vacation!

1:13:24.441 --> 1:13:25.859
I suppose that's my fault too?

1:13:25.943 --> 1:13:29.363
Go to the fucking airport.
Be with your family. I'm not stopping you.

1:14:03.313 --> 1:14:04.273
Where's she going?

1:14:05.023 --> 1:14:05.899
Bedford Hills.

1:14:07.067 --> 1:14:08.110
When does she leave?

1:14:34.970 --> 1:14:35.804
Are you nervous?

1:14:36.722 --> 1:14:40.767
Fuck this place. I'm ready for real prison
with real criminal masterminds.

1:14:40.851 --> 1:14:42.728
It'll make the days more interesting.

1:14:42.811 --> 1:14:45.022
And Bedford Hills, they say it's nice.

1:14:45.731 --> 1:14:46.565
Yeah.

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:55.282
Anna, I… just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1:14:56.408 --> 1:14:57.242
For what?

1:14:58.785 --> 1:15:02.789
For how… everything turned out.

1:15:02.873 --> 1:15:03.999
For all of this.

1:15:04.666 --> 1:15:06.627
-I thought--
-You thought what?

1:15:06.710 --> 1:15:09.379
I know you didn't think
you were going to rescue me.

1:15:10.714 --> 1:15:11.924
Anna, come on.

1:15:12.007 --> 1:15:13.050
No touching.

1:15:16.595 --> 1:15:18.013
I never thought…

1:15:18.096 --> 1:15:20.557
You don't deserve this kind of a sentence.

1:15:20.641 --> 1:15:24.478
The guys who broke the Wall Street banks
didn't get this kind of a sentence.

1:15:24.561 --> 1:15:25.395
You should…

1:15:26.104 --> 1:15:28.065
If I hadn't written that article, I…

1:15:29.024 --> 1:15:31.485
You are just starting out.

1:15:31.568 --> 1:15:34.029
I'm saying… mistakes were made.

1:15:34.112 --> 1:15:38.867
My only mistake was to overestimate
people's ability to handle stress.

1:15:40.911 --> 1:15:42.037
Your only mistake?

1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:48.126
You're telling me… that given
the chance to do this all over again,

1:15:48.210 --> 1:15:49.878
you'd do the exact same things?

1:15:53.715 --> 1:15:54.550
Anna.

1:15:55.467 --> 1:15:58.303
This is it. This is the last time
we're going to see each other.

1:15:58.387 --> 1:16:00.973
I'm saying I'm sorry. I'm asking you--

1:16:01.056 --> 1:16:04.184
No, stop, Vivian. You're not my friend.

1:16:04.268 --> 1:16:08.438
We're not some giggling idiots,
BFF, whatever.

1:16:09.731 --> 1:16:14.319
I don't like you. You have terrible shoes.
This was a transaction. We had a deal.

1:16:15.028 --> 1:16:16.905
-Anna.
-No, it's okay.

1:16:16.989 --> 1:16:19.032
You made good on your part of the deal.

1:16:19.116 --> 1:16:21.952
You said you would
make me famous, and you did.

1:16:22.953 --> 1:16:25.205
Who's more famous right now
than Anna Delvey?

1:16:42.306 --> 1:16:43.307
No touching.

1:16:44.683 --> 1:16:45.767
You'll come visit.

1:16:45.851 --> 1:16:46.727
No touching.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:49.021
You'll come visit.

1:16:54.067 --> 1:16:55.027
I'll visit.

1:16:55.110 --> 1:16:56.903
God, just calm the fuck down.

1:16:56.987 --> 1:16:59.489
-Time's up, Anna. Let's go.
-Okay, I got it. Okay.

1:17:06.246 --> 1:17:07.331
Goodbye, Vivian.

1:17:08.749 --> 1:17:09.708
Goodbye, Anna.

1:17:15.881 --> 1:17:16.965
Vivian…

1:17:19.301 --> 1:17:20.260
you look good.

1:17:21.136 --> 1:17:22.220
You lost some weight.

1:17:22.721 --> 1:17:24.139
You're not so fat anymore.
