WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:03.044
- Macdonald Hall.
- Over the last century,

00:03.045 --> 00:04.505
- Its students
- have gone on to become

00:04.508 --> 00:05.652
Judges, scientists,

00:05.653 --> 00:06.798
journalists,

00:06.799 --> 00:08.280
and one magician who

00:08.281 --> 00:09.759
we don't like to talk about.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.157
But just because they went on

00:11.158 --> 00:12.553
to change the world

00:12.554 --> 00:13.993
doesn't mean they didn't have

00:13.994 --> 00:15.431
any fun while they were here.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.480
What is this noise?

00:21.481 --> 00:23.230
That's Boots.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.379
All-around athlete,

00:24.380 --> 00:25.525
all-around great guy.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.361
- Not much of
- a Death Rooster fan.

00:27.364 --> 00:30.571
Seven-alarm clock sound.

00:31.971 --> 00:33.366
- That's me, Bruno.
- Slacker, rules hacker,

00:33.367 --> 00:34.785
and all-around

00:34.786 --> 00:36.202
not a morning person.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.913
Bruno, we slept in. Practice

00:37.914 --> 00:39.622
starts in 10 minutes.

00:47.361 --> 00:48.801
- The two of us
- don't always agree.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.843
Our schemes don't

00:51.844 --> 00:53.427
always work out.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.389
- We are so cut from the team
- if we're late again.

00:55.392 --> 00:56.765
- Relax. I figured out
- how to shave

00:56.768 --> 00:58.559
- Three minutes
- off our shortcut.

00:58.562 --> 00:59.810
Man, you are so accurate

00:59.811 --> 01:01.060
with a frozen kumquat!

01:02.418 --> 01:03.771
- But we're best friends
- for life. Roomies forever.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.065
Oh, we gotta go.

01:05.068 --> 01:06.484
There's no time for...

01:06.485 --> 01:07.901
Waffles?

01:09.863 --> 01:11.821
- And nothing will ever
- change that.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.539
- Looking good,
- Chris!

01:26.984 --> 01:28.714
- Lucky for us,
- I always have a plan.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.800
Nice.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.553
Finally, some alone time

01:34.554 --> 01:36.304
with my flags of the world.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.309
OK, what do I start with?

01:43.938 --> 01:45.022
You know, I've never

01:45.023 --> 01:46.104
envied the boys

01:46.105 --> 01:47.775
- over at the Hall
- before...

01:47.778 --> 01:49.776
Until aerial meditation day.

01:51.029 --> 01:52.278
Om...

01:53.886 --> 01:55.489
- Cathy and Diane go to
- the school across the street,

01:55.490 --> 01:56.846
the Scrimmage Academy

01:56.847 --> 01:58.200
for Education and Awakening,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.453
which has produced just as many

01:59.454 --> 02:00.703
judges, scientists,

02:00.704 --> 02:02.664
- and journalists
- as Macdonald Hall.

02:03.687 --> 02:04.708
Coming through!

02:06.126 --> 02:07.941
Gotta mow this! Kinda late.

02:07.942 --> 02:09.753
Talk soon, bye!

02:11.174 --> 02:12.590
- And that's Sturgeon,
- our headmaster.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.009
Always on the lookout

02:14.010 --> 02:15.426
for trouble,

02:15.427 --> 02:16.929
- which usually means
- me and Boots.

02:16.932 --> 02:18.097
Sturgeon's nickname

02:18.098 --> 02:19.263
is The Fish,

02:19.264 --> 02:20.641
but you don't wanna call him

02:20.642 --> 02:22.016
that to his face.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.018
Here you go,

02:23.019 --> 02:24.019
Willy,

02:24.020 --> 02:25.646
the updated you-know-what list.

02:25.647 --> 02:27.271
I have divided them

02:27.272 --> 02:29.587
into bad seeds and bad apples.

02:29.588 --> 02:31.901
Ms. Davis, what do you know

02:31.902 --> 02:34.153
about Malbonia?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.614
Is that a skin condition?

02:36.615 --> 02:37.991
Well, technically it's an

02:37.992 --> 02:39.366
unincorporated protectorate

02:39.367 --> 02:41.327
with a constitutional monarchy,

02:41.328 --> 02:43.351
but the real question is,

02:43.352 --> 02:45.372
why is their flag on our pole?

02:45.373 --> 02:47.667
What?

02:47.668 --> 02:48.878
Oh, good Lord.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.429 --> 03:01.180
One hundred.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.810
Roll call!

03:05.811 --> 03:07.542
Hey, look out for

03:07.543 --> 03:09.272
that garbage can! Look out!

03:15.654 --> 03:18.072
Okay, O'Neal...

03:18.073 --> 03:19.741
And that's what I call

03:19.742 --> 03:21.408
sleeping in in style.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.078
- It was so relaxing.
- Why don't

03:23.081 --> 03:24.246
We do it every morning?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.412
Never seen you before. Okay.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.666
- I've been thinking about that.
- I kinda have a plan.

03:27.669 --> 03:29.063
Of course you do.

03:29.064 --> 03:30.459
If we put in job résumés now,

03:30.460 --> 03:31.587
dude, we'll have jobs at the

03:31.588 --> 03:32.712
Hall by the time we graduate

03:32.713 --> 03:33.881
and then we'll never

03:33.882 --> 03:35.048
have to leave.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.300
- I'm just kinda still figuring
- out if we keep our room.

03:37.303 --> 03:39.011
Okay, helmets on!

03:39.014 --> 03:42.138
Let's get... lacrossing.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.807
Yeah, practicing will help us

03:43.808 --> 03:45.474
beat those York turkeys.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.394
- Wouldn't it just be more fun
- to pull a bunch of

03:47.397 --> 03:49.146
- Hilarious
- pranks on them, though?

03:49.149 --> 03:50.376
Come on, we're

03:50.377 --> 03:51.606
better than that.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.201
Is that brains?

04:03.202 --> 04:04.391
Please tell me

04:04.392 --> 04:05.578
that's not your brain!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.331
It's pudding! And it's

04:07.332 --> 04:09.083
on your heads! Ha-ha-ha!

04:10.751 --> 04:12.357
The best part is when you put

04:12.358 --> 04:13.961
the pudding in the helmets.

04:16.028 --> 04:18.091
- Ah yes, Macdonald Hall's
- bitter rivals, York Academy.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.531
This isn't a story about that

04:19.531 --> 04:20.968
rivalry, but it starts there,

04:20.969 --> 04:22.325
thanks to a really

04:22.326 --> 04:23.679
dumb prank called...

04:23.680 --> 04:25.432
The old "putting pudding

04:25.433 --> 04:27.183
in a helmet" gag. Classic!

04:27.184 --> 04:29.457
Let's get out of here.

04:29.458 --> 04:31.729
Later, suckers!

04:31.730 --> 04:33.857
Look on the bright side...

04:33.858 --> 04:35.983
Free pudding!

04:35.984 --> 04:38.485
Ha-ha-ha! Mmm!

04:41.240 --> 04:42.345
Good morning, Headmaster

04:42.346 --> 04:43.449
Hartley speaking,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.681
working hard for my students

04:44.682 --> 04:45.910
every day and every way.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.287
Cut the bull, Hartley,

04:47.288 --> 04:48.662
you know it's me.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.581
Headmaster Sturgeon?

04:50.582 --> 04:51.958
Well, somebody certainly

04:51.959 --> 04:53.333
got vinegar on their chips

04:53.334 --> 04:54.377
this morning.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.672
Actually, Hartley, I was

04:56.673 --> 04:57.922
getting tired of waiting

04:57.923 --> 04:59.612
for your call.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.300
Call? What call exactly?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.365
The one where

05:02.366 --> 05:03.427
your boys apologize

05:03.428 --> 05:05.013
for pulling that infantile prank

05:05.014 --> 05:06.597
on my junior lacrosse team.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.933
Prank? What

05:07.934 --> 05:09.267
do you mean, prank?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.228
- We don't have any pranks
- scheduled here.

05:11.231 --> 05:12.834
Well, I'll just check my agenda,

05:12.835 --> 05:14.438
shall we? Prank...

05:14.439 --> 05:15.774
no... no prank...

05:15.775 --> 05:17.108
no prank...

05:17.109 --> 05:18.944
no...

05:18.947 --> 05:20.258
No, absolutely no prank

05:20.259 --> 05:21.570
scheduled whatsoever.

05:21.571 --> 05:22.905
Come off it, Hartley,

05:22.906 --> 05:23.907
are you telling me

05:23.908 --> 05:24.908
you don't know anything

05:24.909 --> 05:26.055
about these pudding helmets?

05:26.056 --> 05:27.201
Oh my!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.787
- That's not where
- pudding belongs.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.330
- That sounds
- downright messy.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.665
I hope it didn't

05:31.666 --> 05:33.000
set your boys off.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.608
Because pudding needs

05:36.609 --> 05:38.212
to set, you see.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.235
Yeah, I got it, Hartley,

05:39.236 --> 05:40.256
it just wasn't funny.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.446
Oh! Well, you know

05:41.447 --> 05:42.633
what else isn't funny?

05:42.634 --> 05:43.677
I'm getting tired

05:43.678 --> 05:44.718
of waiting around

05:44.719 --> 05:46.053
for you to call me all day!

05:46.054 --> 05:47.347
Call you? What on earth for?

05:47.348 --> 05:48.639
To reassure me

05:48.640 --> 05:50.557
that your students won't stoop

05:50.558 --> 05:51.601
to some lame-o retaliation

05:51.602 --> 05:52.643
against my boys.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.396
You know, let me remind you,

05:54.397 --> 05:56.147
Headmaster Hartley,

05:56.148 --> 05:57.962
that while my boys aren't

05:57.963 --> 05:59.775
perfect, not by a long shot,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.090
they are certainly

06:01.091 --> 06:02.402
well above petty things

06:02.403 --> 06:05.906
like getting revenge. Goodbye.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.388
We need revenge.

06:07.389 --> 06:08.868
All of it.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.037
All in favor?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.247
It's unanimous:

06:12.248 --> 06:13.455
revenge will be sought.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.125
- Okay, just promise me
- whatever we do,

06:15.128 --> 06:17.252
- It's better than
- shoving pudding into a helmet.

06:17.255 --> 06:19.316
Exactly, right? Like,

06:19.317 --> 06:21.379
where's the poetry in that?

06:21.380 --> 06:22.882
Where's the craft?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.382
Alright, so what do we do?

06:25.427 --> 06:26.468
I believe this calls

06:26.469 --> 06:27.971
for a revenge pitch speed round.

06:27.972 --> 06:29.471
Good pitches get a thumbs up,

06:29.472 --> 06:33.226
bad pitches get the gong.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.937
You heard the man.

06:34.938 --> 06:36.645
So what have we got?

06:36.646 --> 06:37.752
We'll play the sound

06:37.753 --> 06:38.856
of an ice cream truck,

06:38.857 --> 06:40.274
and when they come running out,

06:40.275 --> 06:41.964
there's no ice cream.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.928
Okay, I'm not saying

06:46.929 --> 06:48.199
it's a guillotine, but...

06:48.200 --> 06:49.305
okay, it's pretty much

06:49.306 --> 06:50.409
a guillotine.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.122
We infect York's water supply

06:55.123 --> 06:56.145
with a special strain

06:56.146 --> 06:57.166
of rhinovirus,

06:57.167 --> 06:58.356
spliced with just enough

06:58.357 --> 06:59.543
earthworm DNA

06:59.544 --> 07:00.817
to significantly alter their

07:00.818 --> 07:02.088
morphology and create...

07:02.089 --> 07:03.881
Elmer.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.509
Is this another plan to turn

07:05.510 --> 07:07.134
the York boys into worm people?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.262
Would that be a problem?

07:16.477 --> 07:17.541
I like

07:17.542 --> 07:18.604
the sentiment, but...

07:18.605 --> 07:19.648
I'm not sure

07:19.649 --> 07:20.689
we can afford a crane.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.153
My uncle raises these

07:25.154 --> 07:26.653
thoroughbred guinea pigs, right?

07:26.654 --> 07:27.676
I say we borrow, like,

07:27.677 --> 07:28.697
a hundred of them...

07:28.698 --> 07:30.325
Nope! Not even

07:30.326 --> 07:31.951
going there.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.120
Severe guinea pig phobia.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.955
But they're so cute!

07:35.956 --> 07:37.582
- And they have
- such luxurious hair...

07:37.585 --> 07:38.688
Can we please talk

07:38.689 --> 07:39.793
about something else?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.234
And so, I say that we hire

07:43.235 --> 07:44.504
a witch to put a curse

07:44.505 --> 07:46.506
on the York team.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.051
Hm! that's interesting.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.638
Yeah, except for the little

07:51.639 --> 07:54.223
detail that curses aren't real.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.747
What if we put a curse

07:55.748 --> 07:57.268
on the York Academy team,

07:57.269 --> 07:59.396
- but then just don't tell them
- that it's not real?

07:59.399 --> 08:00.731
Wait, athletes are

08:00.732 --> 08:02.064
superstitious...

08:02.065 --> 08:03.212
You mess with their pre-game

08:03.213 --> 08:04.358
traditions and it can throw

08:04.359 --> 08:06.403
- their whole game.
- Exactly, right? If, you know,

08:06.406 --> 08:07.738
Someone steals their mascot,

08:07.739 --> 08:09.071
something like that.

08:10.095 --> 08:11.115
Princess Penelope!

08:12.326 --> 08:13.533
Good shot, boys!

08:13.534 --> 08:16.495
And it's all because of you,

08:16.496 --> 08:18.602
the prettiest princess

08:18.603 --> 08:20.707
in all the land.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.794
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.526
we're gonna steal a princess.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.176
It's about to go down.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.000
Alright, York clothes on.

08:41.001 --> 08:42.770
It's go time. Over.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.086
You know, we are right here.

08:44.087 --> 08:45.399
You could just tell us.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.776
But this way's more fun. Over.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.570
Good point. Over.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.782
Let's do this!

08:59.122 --> 09:02.208
Welcome, parents,

09:02.209 --> 09:05.085
students, pain help,

09:05.086 --> 09:08.255
and our many corporate donors.

09:08.256 --> 09:12.010
Find tomorrow's leaders today!

09:13.761 --> 09:16.805
Welcome, one and all,

09:16.806 --> 09:18.954
to another York Boys

09:18.955 --> 09:21.101
Academy pep rally

09:21.102 --> 09:23.687
where we celebrate victory

09:23.688 --> 09:26.440
before it has actually happened.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.109
Why?

09:29.110 --> 09:31.237
Because, come on!

09:31.238 --> 09:35.449
We are the York Boys Academy!

09:35.450 --> 09:37.285
- Dude, I tackled him
- so hard,

09:37.288 --> 09:38.495
It's a miracle

09:38.496 --> 09:39.703
he can still walk.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.872
That's 'cause you're

09:40.873 --> 09:42.039
the greatest, Chip.

09:43.438 --> 09:44.834
Hey, did you hear that?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.359
Let's check it out.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.005
Hey, what are you doing?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.279
Check it out,

09:51.280 --> 09:52.550
it's Hartley!

09:52.551 --> 09:53.740
Look at those teeth.

09:53.741 --> 09:54.927
Ha-ha-ha!

09:54.928 --> 09:56.887
That's my dad, man.

09:56.888 --> 10:00.099
His nose is way bigger!

10:02.082 --> 10:04.062
Make it bigger, make it bigger.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.692
Oh yeah.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.133
Oh, add some spinach

10:12.134 --> 10:13.571
to his teeth. Yeah.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.059
Oh yeah, he's like

10:22.060 --> 10:23.080
a hundred years old, man.

10:23.081 --> 10:25.082
Can't forget the wrinkles.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.397
Hey, guys.

10:26.398 --> 10:27.709
Hey, man.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.547
That is just wrong, man.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.260
Copy that. Princess

10:35.261 --> 10:36.385
is traveling.

10:36.386 --> 10:39.054
Yo, let's go.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.515
You really captured

10:40.516 --> 10:41.974
his lack of scruples.

10:43.373 --> 10:44.768
Nice job,

10:44.769 --> 10:46.396
little weird artist dude.

10:46.397 --> 10:48.021
Oh man, that's just wrong.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.219
Yes!

10:56.220 --> 10:57.281
They had no idea!

10:57.282 --> 10:59.325
Totally clueless.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.890
High fives for a perfectly

11:00.891 --> 11:02.453
planned caper.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.497
Uh-uh. Gotta keep my hands

11:03.498 --> 11:04.538
at ten and two.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.039
Driving's no joke, boys.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.396
High five for Wilbur getting

11:07.397 --> 11:08.750
his license last month

11:08.751 --> 11:10.357
and being such

11:10.358 --> 11:11.962
a conscientious driver.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.008
- When's the last time
- you ate, Wilbur?

11:15.011 --> 11:16.259
Don't look at me.

11:21.808 --> 11:23.183
It came from the cage.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.770
That does not sound

11:26.771 --> 11:28.479
like a princess.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.856
As many of you know,

11:30.857 --> 11:33.025
our beloved Princess Penelope

11:33.026 --> 11:34.985
died earlier this month

11:34.986 --> 11:36.634
after 17 years

11:36.635 --> 11:38.280
of devoted service.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.283
Why, that's almost a hundred

11:41.284 --> 11:43.536
in cat years,

11:43.537 --> 11:45.268
and almost 200

11:45.269 --> 11:46.997
in mascot years.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.000
But, sometimes,

11:49.001 --> 11:51.001
the passing of a loved one

11:51.002 --> 11:53.711
gives one the opportunity

11:53.712 --> 11:55.256
to rethink your branding

11:55.257 --> 11:56.798
strategy, which is why

11:56.799 --> 11:58.447
I am proud to introduce

11:58.448 --> 12:00.093
to you all

12:00.094 --> 12:01.908
York Boys Academy Cougars'

12:01.909 --> 12:03.721
new mascot,

12:03.722 --> 12:06.350
Princess Murdertooth!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.254
Oh, dude!

12:22.910 --> 12:24.660
A bowl of pudding?

12:24.661 --> 12:28.081
Curse you, Macdonald Hall!

12:37.131 --> 12:38.549
Who has an actual,

12:38.550 --> 12:39.966
real live cougar

12:39.967 --> 12:41.468
as their mascot? Why?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.430
- Because they are called
- the Cougars, right?

12:43.433 --> 12:45.057
Fun fact: cougars

12:45.058 --> 12:46.682
aren't considered big cats.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.976
They fall into the same family

12:47.977 --> 12:49.268
as housecats.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.104
- Fun fact:
- you can't talk about fun facts

12:51.107 --> 12:53.106
- When you're dead!
- That's a technicality.

12:53.109 --> 12:54.482
What do we do?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.857
We calm down. We calm down.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.318
It's perfectly secure

12:57.319 --> 12:58.776
inside its cage.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.368
OK, it's...

13:05.369 --> 13:06.744
it's perfectly secure

13:06.745 --> 13:08.579
inside the van.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.004
You were saying?

13:16.005 --> 13:17.379
What the...

13:17.380 --> 13:18.715
That cougar's

13:18.716 --> 13:20.048
a terrible driver!

13:20.049 --> 13:21.655
He's definitely not keeping

13:21.656 --> 13:23.260
his hands at ten and two!

13:23.261 --> 13:25.220
Let's go, we gotta get it!

13:25.221 --> 13:28.766
Come on!

13:30.103 --> 13:31.435
- The surprisingly
- low speed chase ended

13:31.436 --> 13:33.146
with animal control officers

13:33.147 --> 13:34.854
tranquilizing the animal.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.023
Charged with one count

13:36.024 --> 13:37.190
of purchasing

13:37.191 --> 13:39.068
a banned exotic animal

13:39.069 --> 13:40.944
is Thomas J. Hartley,

13:40.945 --> 13:42.238
headmaster of the now

13:42.239 --> 13:43.530
formerly prestigious

13:43.531 --> 13:46.200
York Boys Academy, who faces

13:46.201 --> 13:48.868
disciplinary action.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.163
Headmaster Hartley

13:50.164 --> 13:51.456
lost his job today.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.375
We're sorry.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.294
Because your shenanigans

13:56.297 --> 13:58.025
Brought to light his black

13:58.026 --> 13:59.755
market animal purchase.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.174
Uh, you're welcome?

14:04.218 --> 14:06.304
Boys, since you've both been

14:06.305 --> 14:08.388
together here at the Hall,

14:08.389 --> 14:10.079
you've found yourselves in no

14:10.080 --> 14:11.767
small amount of trouble, hm?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.520
Pancake launcher,

14:13.521 --> 14:15.270
illegal road tolls,

14:15.271 --> 14:16.523
underground tunnel to the local

14:16.524 --> 14:17.773
movie theater...

14:17.774 --> 14:19.191
Attempted tunnel,

14:19.192 --> 14:20.734
sir.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.486
Oh, I stand corrected.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.406
What Bruno means is that

14:24.407 --> 14:26.323
we will graciously accept

14:26.324 --> 14:27.742
whatever punishment

14:27.743 --> 14:29.159
you think is fair.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.120
No, actually, I think the time

14:31.121 --> 14:33.079
for punishment is over.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.895
I think for the sake of the Hall

14:34.896 --> 14:36.709
and its legal bills...

14:36.710 --> 14:39.586
We need to have a change.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.381
We punish you?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.342
- Do some kind
- of yard work?

14:44.345 --> 14:45.531
Keep in mind, I burn easy.

14:45.532 --> 14:46.719
I'm less concerned

14:46.720 --> 14:48.929
- about punishing you for the past
- and more interested

14:48.932 --> 14:50.473
- In preparing
- you for the future.

14:50.476 --> 14:52.475
- What future?
- A future where you're no longer

14:52.478 --> 14:53.933
At the Hall.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.603
- Or living together,
- for that matter.

14:55.606 --> 14:57.103
Actually, sir,

14:57.104 --> 14:58.981
- I have a plan for that.
- I'm sure you do, O'Neal,

14:58.984 --> 15:00.400
But a big part of growing up

15:00.401 --> 15:01.817
is adapting to change,

15:01.818 --> 15:03.361
and it's my job to ensure that

15:03.362 --> 15:04.903
you're up for the challenge.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.593
Which is why,

15:06.594 --> 15:08.281
effective immediately,

15:08.282 --> 15:11.201
I'm separating the two of you.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.599
That's...

15:12.600 --> 15:13.995
No...

15:13.996 --> 15:15.269
No, sir, that's...

15:15.270 --> 15:16.540
Okay, um,

15:16.541 --> 15:17.938
let's just talk this through...

15:17.939 --> 15:19.334
No need.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.879
My decision's final.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.464
- I know it's gonna take some
- adjusting,

15:23.467 --> 15:24.965
- But I'm sure
- you'll be up to it.

15:24.968 --> 15:26.634
- What if we're not
- up for it?

15:26.637 --> 15:27.823
What happens then? Have you

15:27.824 --> 15:29.011
even thought about that?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.223
I very, very strongly suggest

15:32.224 --> 15:33.807
you find a way, O'Neal,

15:33.808 --> 15:35.289
because if you don't,

15:35.290 --> 15:36.769
you'll find yourself

15:36.770 --> 15:39.521
not at the Hall much longer.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.023
Yes, sir.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.359
I know this is gonna be

15:43.360 --> 15:44.693
difficult, but I truly believe

15:44.694 --> 15:45.904
it'll do you both good

15:45.905 --> 15:47.112
to see what you're capable of

15:47.113 --> 15:48.739
separately.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.304
So, as of right now, no more

15:50.305 --> 15:51.867
classes, no more clubs,

15:51.868 --> 15:54.661
no more roommates.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.247
No more

15:56.248 --> 15:57.832
Bruno and Boots.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.931
Ms. Davis dropped these off.

16:12.932 --> 16:14.473
Our new roommate assignments.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.225
- We should probably
- get it over with.

16:16.228 --> 16:17.977
- I wanna give you
- something first.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.771
Dude!

16:20.772 --> 16:23.106
My party shades! Ha!

16:23.107 --> 16:26.401
Uh... oh! Here.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.904
My lucky puck.

16:29.906 --> 16:30.969
Isn't this the puck that

16:30.970 --> 16:32.031
hit you in the stomach?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.408
Yep, but it's lucky

16:33.409 --> 16:34.556
because it didn't nail me

16:34.557 --> 16:35.703
anywhere lower.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.668
What's wrong, man?

16:41.669 --> 16:43.627
I've never seen you like this.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.630
I'm not good with change.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.383
My parents once painted my room

16:48.384 --> 16:50.133
without telling me...

16:50.134 --> 16:51.135
I didn't sleep

16:51.136 --> 16:52.136
for a month, Bruno.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.201
Don't be scared.

16:54.202 --> 16:56.264
Here, look. Come here.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.266
You take the smoothie station.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.998
Okay? I'll be fine.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.728
That's just it! You'll be fine!

17:01.729 --> 17:03.982
- You're Bruno Walton, you always
- land on your feet!

17:03.985 --> 17:05.150
You've got

17:05.151 --> 17:06.316
a plan! What do I have?

17:06.317 --> 17:08.027
- Yes, that's right.
- That's right, I do.

17:08.030 --> 17:10.444
And so... here.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.386
You take your half, I'll take

17:12.387 --> 17:14.324
mine. Hang on to that.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.742
We're gonna be making cheddar

17:15.743 --> 17:17.160
and bacon smoothies in no time.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.704
Yeah, I actually hate those.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.999
I promise you.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.125
Alright.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.023
How weird can our roommate

17:26.025 --> 17:27.922
assignments actually be, right?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.595
Yeah, that weird.

17:42.730 --> 17:43.854
- Don't you have
- your own hazmat suit?

17:43.855 --> 17:45.188
Pardon?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.712
Don't you have

17:46.713 --> 17:48.233
your own hazmat suit?

17:48.234 --> 17:50.944
Uh, no? Should I?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.906
- Opening a window
- should suffice.

17:52.909 --> 17:55.115
Welcome, roomie.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.870
Lot of stuff and gear, Elmer.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.705
And why is it so creepy?

18:01.706 --> 18:02.749
My world is the world

18:02.750 --> 18:03.790
of science,

18:03.791 --> 18:04.918
the world of knowledge

18:04.919 --> 18:06.043
and discovery.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.962
- Yeah, okay, but where
- did the last guy live?

18:07.965 --> 18:09.401
For some reason, he elected

18:09.402 --> 18:10.839
to live in a box. On the roof!

18:12.697 --> 18:14.551
I can't imagine why.

18:15.575 --> 18:16.595
My synthetic mucus!

18:16.596 --> 18:18.265
Oh, sorry! I did not

18:18.266 --> 18:19.932
mean to... wow.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.518
That is a new smell.

18:21.519 --> 18:23.101
I can see we're going to have

18:23.102 --> 18:25.521
- to establish some ground rules.
- Let me start with a list

18:25.524 --> 18:27.773
Of things you shouldn't touch.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.046
Test tubes, beakers,

18:29.047 --> 18:30.316
petri dishes,

18:30.317 --> 18:31.632
anything on the primary

18:31.633 --> 18:32.945
or secondary science tables,

18:32.946 --> 18:34.510
likewise my pheromones

18:34.511 --> 18:36.073
of the animal kingdom,

18:36.074 --> 18:37.283
and you do not wanna touch

18:37.284 --> 18:38.491
any of the slime molds

18:38.492 --> 18:40.286
in the specimen fridge.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.643
OK, but what about

18:42.644 --> 18:43.705
the blueberry yogurt?

18:43.706 --> 18:45.708
What blueberry yogurt?

19:05.562 --> 19:06.728
Hi. This is...

19:08.461 --> 19:10.189
- Mr. O'Neal, welcome.
- Mr. Wexford-Smith III

19:10.190 --> 19:11.838
has been expecting you.

19:11.839 --> 19:13.486
He has?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.708
Is this room bigger

19:28.709 --> 19:30.107
on the inside?

19:30.108 --> 19:31.503
Considerably.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.755
But well worth the expense.

19:33.756 --> 19:36.134
Murray, if you please?

19:38.886 --> 19:40.887
Good to have you on board.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.035
So you're outsourcing

19:42.036 --> 19:43.181
handshakes now.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.641
I was a skeptic,

19:44.642 --> 19:46.644
until I ran the numbers.

19:46.645 --> 19:48.645
Welcome to your new home.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.856
Non-disclosure agreement.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.942
You shouldn't have.

19:51.943 --> 19:53.025
Well, living here,

19:53.026 --> 19:54.340
you may be privy to trade

19:54.341 --> 19:55.652
secrets, cap and trade policies,

19:55.653 --> 19:56.696
etc. etc.

19:56.697 --> 19:57.737
Most of all...

19:59.220 --> 20:00.699
I love the smell of contracts

20:00.700 --> 20:02.868
in the morning.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.620
I need to lie down.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.622
Where do you sleep?

20:09.625 --> 20:11.835
Sleep?

20:11.836 --> 20:13.254
And miss a day's trade

20:13.255 --> 20:14.671
or the Tokyo Stock Exchange?

20:14.672 --> 20:16.507
No, no, no, no. That's

20:16.508 --> 20:18.341
Murray's job now, old fence.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.720
I'm sorry, but I need a bed

20:21.721 --> 20:23.680
to sleep in, to study in,

20:23.681 --> 20:25.683
- to sleep in while pretending
- to be studying...

20:25.686 --> 20:27.393
- This is not gonna work,
- I'm sorry.

20:27.396 --> 20:28.894
Relax, old sock.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.125
We have you all settled.

20:30.126 --> 20:31.354
Right over here.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.860
You'll be snug as a bug.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
- I mean, of course I'll expect
- you to clean out

20:38.866 --> 20:40.344
By start of business hours

20:40.345 --> 20:41.823
each AM, but until then,

20:41.824 --> 20:43.408
welcome home.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.327
Ah! That's my 6:50.

21:16.548 --> 21:17.984
Hey!

21:17.985 --> 21:20.278
So you deciphered my code.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.468
A picture of the place

21:21.469 --> 21:22.655
we're secretly meeting at

21:22.656 --> 21:23.678
doesn't really

21:23.679 --> 21:24.699
qualify as a code.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.659
So, how's living with George?

21:26.660 --> 21:27.808
Is it true that his room's

21:27.809 --> 21:28.954
actually some company?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.081
Yeah, no, I sleep

21:30.082 --> 21:31.206
next to the photocopier.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.209
- And it's not so much sleep
- as I close my eyes

21:33.212 --> 21:34.293
For ten seconds before

21:34.294 --> 21:35.376
somebody prints something.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.130
- Well, um,
- I found

21:37.133 --> 21:38.173
One of Elmer's carnivorous

21:38.174 --> 21:39.214
centipedes in my bed.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.508
Don't ask why I know

21:40.509 --> 21:41.800
it's carnivorous.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.866
I'm glad at least one of us is

21:43.867 --> 21:45.929
getting a kick out of all this.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.889
Wait a minute.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.308
I know that smirk.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.725
You've got a plan.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.207
Why else would I call you here?

21:52.208 --> 21:53.686
OK, well, make it quick.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.709
If The Fish catches us

21:54.710 --> 21:55.730
together, we're through.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.942
- Should I get the guys together - for a meeting?
- No, no.

21:57.945 --> 21:59.611
Actually, this plan kinda means

21:59.612 --> 22:01.278
doing the exact opposite.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.988
Normally,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.428
we ask our friends for a bit

22:04.429 --> 22:05.865
of help, right? This time,

22:05.866 --> 22:07.117
our friends are gonna help us

22:07.118 --> 22:08.367
without them even knowing.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.870
We're about to become

22:09.871 --> 22:11.370
the worst roommates

22:11.371 --> 22:13.103
in the history

22:13.104 --> 22:14.833
of rooms... or mates.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.671
I call it Operation Doommates.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.007
Then Sturgeon threw some butter

22:22.008 --> 22:23.424
and someone threw some icing in,

22:23.425 --> 22:24.802
and then it just turned into

22:24.803 --> 22:26.178
this huge epic food fight

22:26.179 --> 22:27.826
right on stage.

22:27.827 --> 22:29.472
Such tales of waste, Bruno!

22:29.473 --> 22:30.787
You could've fed

22:30.788 --> 22:32.100
dozens instead!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.811
Macdonald Hall

22:33.812 --> 22:35.520
is a dream school.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.730
Every day, it's zany antics.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.025
What are you doing?

22:39.026 --> 22:40.317
Oh, just talking to Francisco,

22:40.318 --> 22:41.799
your Malbonian video pen pal.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.278
Hey, Elmer!

22:43.279 --> 22:44.405
Yeah, my Malbonian

22:44.406 --> 22:45.530
video pen pal!

22:45.531 --> 22:47.220
Hey, Franny, you should

22:47.221 --> 22:48.908
totally come to the Hall!

22:48.909 --> 22:49.973
You know, maybe there's,

22:49.974 --> 22:51.036
like, an exchange or...

22:51.037 --> 22:52.871
No! No, no, no, no, no!

22:52.872 --> 22:54.227
Come to MacDonald Hall?

22:54.228 --> 22:55.581
Where students sell doorknobs

22:55.582 --> 22:57.583
and don't go to jail?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.002
Where are my test tubes?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.419
Ah man, you know what?

23:00.420 --> 23:02.421
The charity drive came by today.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.507
They must have taken it.

23:03.508 --> 23:04.590
Bruno, those were

23:04.591 --> 23:05.759
highly concentrated

23:05.760 --> 23:06.926
skunk pheromones

23:06.927 --> 23:08.385
I was collecting for a year!

23:08.386 --> 23:09.596
If one of those

23:09.597 --> 23:10.805
test tubes breaks,

23:10.806 --> 23:11.912
it'll be skunk mating

23:11.913 --> 23:13.016
season for months!

23:13.017 --> 23:14.164
Elmer, I'm sorry,

23:14.165 --> 23:15.310
I had no idea.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.647
What is that?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.691
Oh, Mr. Captain Cuddles?

23:21.692 --> 23:24.070
- I've had him for like ten years.
- Have you guys not met?

23:24.073 --> 23:26.029
Wherever he goes, I go.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.780
Isn't that right, Mr. Cuddles?

23:27.781 --> 23:29.262
Aren't you cute?

23:29.263 --> 23:30.743
Look at you, you're so cute!

23:32.828 --> 23:34.913
Well, you can rest assured,

23:34.914 --> 23:36.207
because when it comes to

23:36.208 --> 23:37.498
collateralized debt obligations,

23:37.499 --> 23:38.584
I happen to be

23:38.585 --> 23:39.667
a bit of an expert.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.337
Hello? Hello?

23:42.338 --> 23:45.715
Hello? What are you doing?

23:45.716 --> 23:49.261
This simply cannot be!

23:49.262 --> 23:51.637
Oh, sorry, George.

23:51.638 --> 23:52.994
I gotta be ready for

23:52.995 --> 23:54.349
the Junior Jazz Ensemble.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.476
The show is only

23:55.477 --> 23:56.601
three months away!

23:56.602 --> 23:58.083
This just

23:58.084 --> 23:59.562
cost me a client!

23:59.563 --> 24:01.606
I'll try and play as quietly

24:01.607 --> 24:04.110
as I possibly can.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.950
See? It's like

24:10.951 --> 24:13.243
I'm not even here!

24:13.244 --> 24:16.372
Ms. Davis? Ms. Davis!

24:18.540 --> 24:19.646
[GEORGE AND ELMER

24:23.503 --> 24:24.797
It was so loud I could

24:24.798 --> 24:26.090
feel it in my chest!

24:28.801 --> 24:30.594
- I can't believe
- this is working.

24:30.597 --> 24:31.700
Hey, I made a promise,

24:31.701 --> 24:32.804
didn't I?

24:32.805 --> 24:33.848
Rinse and repeat until

24:33.849 --> 24:34.889
we're roomies again.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.642
Alright, alright, alright!

24:36.643 --> 24:38.393
Take it easy, Einstein!

24:38.394 --> 24:39.457
Don't get your fifties

24:39.458 --> 24:40.519
in a knot. Here.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.605
Fill out these roommate

24:41.606 --> 24:42.688
request forms.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.504
Now you need to

24:44.505 --> 24:46.319
build up an appetite.

24:54.327 --> 24:59.414
♪ I stick to you like glue ♪

24:59.415 --> 25:01.083
♪ You're my weekend

25:01.084 --> 25:02.750
I like what you did ♪

25:04.463 --> 25:06.171
'Sup, roomie?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.339
Hey, this isn't

25:07.340 --> 25:08.506
your food, is it?

25:10.717 --> 25:12.635
This isn't gonna work out.

25:19.143 --> 25:22.270
Um, you boys wouldn't be

25:22.271 --> 25:23.794
intentionally bad fits for all

25:23.795 --> 25:25.315
your new roommates, would you?

25:25.316 --> 25:27.068
Mr. Sturgeon, I can honestly

25:27.069 --> 25:28.818
say we would be terrible fits

25:28.819 --> 25:30.362
with anybody.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.904
We're trying our best, sir.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.823
Ah, don't worry.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.451
There are over 300 new boys

25:35.452 --> 25:37.077
for you to try harder with.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.214
Operation Doommates just got

25:48.215 --> 25:50.048
a "snore-midable" improvement.

25:56.369 --> 25:57.847
You gotta be kidding me!

25:59.372 --> 26:00.892
- Aw, man! Come on,
- be quiet, let me sleep!

26:00.893 --> 26:02.353
Incoming.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.238
Here we go again.

26:30.256 --> 26:33.092
Do angels live here?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.646
No, I don't drink tea.

26:48.399 --> 26:50.172
Actually, you know,

26:50.173 --> 26:51.944
I'll give it a try.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
Ah! Thank you.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.137
Man, I've been on fire!

27:18.138 --> 27:19.845
Bro, most of these kids

27:19.846 --> 27:21.390
- don't even last
- a single night with me!

27:21.393 --> 27:22.767
Carlos, done.

27:22.768 --> 27:24.142
Brian J., done.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.436
That Gordon kid that never

27:25.437 --> 27:26.727
stopped typing, done.

27:26.728 --> 27:28.001
Wow! That's great,

27:28.002 --> 27:29.272
man, really.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.150
- If you've been
- keeping up with me,

27:31.153 --> 27:32.422
We have got to be through most

27:32.423 --> 27:33.692
of the roommate options by now.

27:33.693 --> 27:34.987
Gimme your names,

27:34.988 --> 27:36.279
I'll cross them off.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.698
I'm... kind of still

27:37.699 --> 27:39.115
living with Chris.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.868
What? Dude, it's been

27:40.869 --> 27:42.619
over a week!

27:42.620 --> 27:43.869
Doesn't he drive you crazy,

27:43.870 --> 27:45.539
- always never talking,
- always so quiet?

27:45.542 --> 27:47.206
Well...

27:47.207 --> 27:48.876
Mumsie, look! The Duke of

27:48.877 --> 27:50.543
Bermondsey's driving a lorry,

27:50.544 --> 27:52.129
and he's wearing a jumper!

27:52.130 --> 27:53.712
Cheerio!

27:53.713 --> 27:56.549
So he really is British.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.426
Super British.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.677
Dude, it's been over a week!

28:00.678 --> 28:01.951
Meanwhile, I've been

28:01.952 --> 28:03.222
burning through roommates

28:03.223 --> 28:04.495
like sulfuric acid

28:04.496 --> 28:05.766
burns through iron.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.998
I think I still have

28:06.999 --> 28:08.227
some residual Elmer on me.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.793
I know, but Chris

28:09.794 --> 28:11.356
is a good guy.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.358
I don't know, I kinda

28:12.359 --> 28:13.359
like living with him.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.902
What's wrong? Do you need a

28:14.903 --> 28:16.444
hand? 'Cause I can come by...

28:16.445 --> 28:18.009
No, no. Tonight's

28:18.010 --> 28:19.572
- watercolor night.
- Excuse me?

28:19.573 --> 28:20.741
I... it's

28:20.742 --> 28:21.907
just a thing...

28:21.908 --> 28:23.700
that we do. Obviously,

28:23.701 --> 28:25.745
- I didn't have the greatest
- technique at first,

28:25.748 --> 28:26.767
But he really helped me

28:26.768 --> 28:27.788
work on my brush strokes

28:27.789 --> 28:28.998
and my use of negative space,

28:28.999 --> 28:30.042
and the whole thing

28:30.043 --> 28:31.083
just came to...

28:31.084 --> 28:32.960
What?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.920
I like painting!

28:34.921 --> 28:36.089
Whatever. We just need

28:36.090 --> 28:37.256
to stick to the plan.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.176
- Don't you think that maybe
- we've been taking

28:39.179 --> 28:41.011
- Some of this
- Doommate stuff pretty far?

28:41.014 --> 28:42.720
You'll get over it, dude.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.826
All we're doing is slightly

28:43.827 --> 28:44.930
annoying people

28:44.931 --> 28:46.516
for a good cause. We're like

28:46.517 --> 28:48.100
mosquitoes who recycle.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.603
Well, maybe I don't

28:49.604 --> 28:51.104
wanna be Chris' mosquito.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.066
Are you forgetting why

28:54.067 --> 28:55.525
we're doing this, dude?

28:55.526 --> 28:56.798
You know, "I can't

28:56.799 --> 28:58.069
handle change, Bruno!

28:58.070 --> 28:59.238
Help me, Bruno! I'm

28:59.239 --> 29:00.405
nothing without you!"

29:00.406 --> 29:02.012
Okay, I remember the first two,

29:02.013 --> 29:03.616
not so sure about the last one.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.201
I know what you meant.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.766
Anyways, don't you still

29:06.767 --> 29:08.329
wanna live together?

29:08.330 --> 29:10.124
Of course!

29:10.125 --> 29:11.916
I swear. Just...

29:11.917 --> 29:13.356
maybe we should take a break

29:13.357 --> 29:14.793
for a couple days, you know,

29:14.794 --> 29:15.795
make sure we still have

29:15.796 --> 29:16.796
some friends left.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.298
I suppose next you'll want me

29:18.299 --> 29:19.798
to give back Elmer's pheromones.

29:19.799 --> 29:21.800
Hey!

29:21.801 --> 29:24.012
That's the spirit! C'mon!

29:25.514 --> 29:27.266
Let's go.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.816
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing here? I...

29:36.819 --> 29:38.443
Elmer's pheromones, please.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.716
There's three words that

29:39.717 --> 29:40.986
should never go together.

29:42.511 --> 29:44.031
- Have you tried
- buying him dinner?

29:44.032 --> 29:45.326
What happened

29:45.327 --> 29:46.618
to Operation Doommates?

29:46.619 --> 29:48.494
Thank you.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.684
But he's been practicing

29:49.685 --> 29:50.871
his brush stroke technique.

29:50.872 --> 29:54.083
Not to be a drama llama,

29:54.084 --> 29:55.419
but are you guys okay?

29:55.420 --> 29:56.753
Never better.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.547
- I'll take that.
- No, you need

29:58.550 --> 29:59.736
To get back to Chris.

29:59.737 --> 30:00.923
I said I got it.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.301
You don't trust me now?

30:02.302 --> 30:03.676
Come on, dude, gimme the phero...

30:04.803 --> 30:06.596
Ugh, that stuff reeks!

30:06.597 --> 30:07.682
We are so sorry. We will

30:07.683 --> 30:08.765
- stay and clean up.
- Uh, no.

30:08.766 --> 30:10.891
We have no time.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.269
We have to get you back

30:12.270 --> 30:13.646
to that canvas. See you, gals!

30:15.481 --> 30:16.836
Okay...

30:16.837 --> 30:18.190
Uh...

30:18.191 --> 30:19.942
Are you serious?

30:19.943 --> 30:21.737
- So they can use a little
- air freshener!

30:21.740 --> 30:22.988
What's the worst that

30:22.989 --> 30:24.238
could actually happen?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.865
Uh... that?

30:31.871 --> 30:33.373
And that.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.022
We should go.

30:36.023 --> 30:37.461
Really should.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.956
Boys, a couple of things

30:52.957 --> 30:54.811
have come to my attention.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.479
Oh...

30:56.480 --> 30:59.462
Uh, I think what Boots

30:59.463 --> 31:02.443
meant to say was, uh, "Oh?"

31:02.444 --> 31:03.967
Let's begin with how

31:03.968 --> 31:05.488
incompatible you both seem to be

31:05.489 --> 31:06.928
with virtually

31:06.929 --> 31:08.366
every other boy in dorm 1.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.639
Yeah, it's a real shame.

31:09.640 --> 31:10.909
I feel like I could room

31:10.910 --> 31:12.308
with anyone, but I don't know,

31:12.309 --> 31:13.705
I guess the other guys just...

31:13.706 --> 31:14.853
don't feel the

31:14.854 --> 31:15.998
same way about me.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.459
Yeah... ditto.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.358
Hm. It's almost as if the only

31:20.359 --> 31:22.254
people you two can live with

31:22.255 --> 31:24.256
are... the two of you.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.552
Almost, sir.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.640
Except for one little wrinkle.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.206
The plan to separate you is

31:35.207 --> 31:37.102
working. Boots' marks are up 6%.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.522
Really? That's great!

31:39.523 --> 31:41.525
But 6% is not that much.

31:41.526 --> 31:43.526
It's enough for me to think

31:43.527 --> 31:44.986
- that separating you was
- a good idea.

31:44.989 --> 31:46.739
- I'm tempted
- to keep it that way for good.

31:46.742 --> 31:48.094
But that's not part

31:48.095 --> 31:49.448
of the plan. I mean, uh...

31:49.449 --> 31:51.116
I mean... no...

31:51.117 --> 31:52.535
Not like we have a plan.

31:52.536 --> 31:53.952
Or I had a plan.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.080
What plan?

31:56.081 --> 31:57.729
Well, regardless,

31:57.730 --> 31:59.375
there's another little wrinkle

31:59.376 --> 32:00.857
that's going to affect the way

32:00.858 --> 32:02.336
we all live for a while.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.547
Something happened at

32:03.548 --> 32:04.756
Scrimmage's last night.

32:04.757 --> 32:07.007
Oh... I mean,

32:07.008 --> 32:08.718
oh?

32:08.719 --> 32:11.534
Yeah, massive skunk damage. Some

32:11.535 --> 32:14.348
kind of skunk mating frenzy.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.476
- Carpets have to be ripped out,
- wood replaced...

32:16.479 --> 32:18.270
- The air quality alone means
- it's going to be

32:18.273 --> 32:19.979
- Uninhabitable
- for months.

32:19.982 --> 32:21.043
I guess you already

32:21.044 --> 32:22.106
know that we...

32:22.107 --> 32:23.525
- Would have no choice
- but to invite

32:23.528 --> 32:24.547
Our neighbors here

32:24.548 --> 32:25.568
in their time of need.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.862
P... pardon?

32:26.863 --> 32:28.154
Say what now?

32:30.156 --> 32:31.991
- Attention,
- Macdonald Hall students,

32:31.994 --> 32:33.034
This is

32:33.035 --> 32:34.076
Headmaster Sturgeon.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.767
Macdonald Hall's mission is

32:35.768 --> 32:37.455
to ensure each of you grow up

32:37.456 --> 32:39.665
to be functioning adults,

32:39.666 --> 32:40.917
and also understand

32:40.918 --> 32:42.167
that change,

32:42.168 --> 32:43.566
however difficult,

32:43.567 --> 32:44.962
can also be a good thing,

32:44.963 --> 32:46.444
especially when it means

32:46.445 --> 32:47.924
being a good citizen

32:47.925 --> 32:49.383
and a good neighbor.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.427
There will be some new

32:50.428 --> 32:51.469
faces in this school,

32:51.470 --> 32:52.805
and possibly for the rest

32:52.806 --> 32:54.138
of the year,

32:54.139 --> 32:55.808
because Macdonald Hall is now

32:55.809 --> 32:57.475
the new temporary home

32:57.476 --> 32:59.561
of Scrimmage Academy.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.982
Please welcome our guests,

33:02.983 --> 33:04.315
while giving them

33:04.316 --> 33:06.151
- what little space
- we can offer.

33:06.154 --> 33:08.153
- Although their classes
- and living quarters

33:08.156 --> 33:10.072
Will remain separate, we'll all

33:10.073 --> 33:11.989
be under the same roof.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.388
Maybe we should take our

33:13.389 --> 33:14.784
chances with the skunks.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.141
It smells like

33:16.142 --> 33:17.496
grandpas in here.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.270
Come on, Diane.

33:21.271 --> 33:23.334
So let's all rise

33:23.335 --> 33:25.087
to the challenge of this

33:25.088 --> 33:26.838
temporary change, shall we,

33:26.839 --> 33:28.758
and embrace the opportunity

33:28.759 --> 33:30.675
to grow and to learn.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.990
Thank you.

33:31.991 --> 33:33.302
Wow.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.388
So what does this mean?

33:34.389 --> 33:35.471
Uh, it means that space

33:35.472 --> 33:36.786
is now very limited,

33:36.787 --> 33:38.098
so no more room changes.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.372
Compatibility is a luxury

33:39.373 --> 33:40.643
we can no longer afford.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.187
But our... our room!

33:42.188 --> 33:43.729
Your room is now...

33:43.730 --> 33:46.273
Ah!

33:46.274 --> 33:47.922
Scrimmage's Therapeutic

33:47.923 --> 33:49.568
Bubble Wrap Room.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.675
Apparently, popping

33:50.676 --> 33:51.779
bubbles is a keystone

33:51.780 --> 33:52.906
of her curriculum.

33:52.907 --> 33:54.031
I'm sorry, boys,

33:54.032 --> 33:55.951
- you won't be living together
- anytime soon,

33:55.954 --> 33:57.786
- Not until things
- are back to normal. Clear?

33:57.789 --> 33:59.225
Yes, sir. This

33:59.226 --> 34:00.663
certainly brings everything

34:00.664 --> 34:02.207
into perspective.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.749
Oh, does it now?

34:04.961 --> 34:06.168
Hello! Make way! Hello!

34:06.169 --> 34:08.963
Coming through! Oh, watch out!

34:08.964 --> 34:11.507
Oh, hello!

34:11.507 --> 34:14.176
Eugenia... I mean Ms. Scrimmage,

34:14.177 --> 34:15.887
what are you doing here?

34:15.888 --> 34:17.596
Hello, office mate.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.514
May I just say

34:19.516 --> 34:20.538
that your generosity

34:20.539 --> 34:21.559
is an inspiration,

34:21.560 --> 34:23.978
and quite unexpected. Oh!

34:23.978 --> 34:25.938
So much possibility in here.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.982
All of this... gone.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.422
Uh, you're moving

34:29.422 --> 34:30.860
into my office?

34:30.860 --> 34:32.362
Well, as headmistress, I need

34:32.364 --> 34:33.862
a nexus of concentration,

34:33.864 --> 34:35.324
and if the boys and girls

34:35.324 --> 34:36.782
can share the school,

34:36.783 --> 34:37.784
surely you and I

34:37.784 --> 34:38.784
can share one room.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.099
How would you say that the

34:40.100 --> 34:41.411
energy flows best in this room...

34:41.413 --> 34:43.956
This way, or this way?

34:43.956 --> 34:45.751
Wouldn't you be much happier

34:45.752 --> 34:47.543
in a... oh, I don't know,

34:47.543 --> 34:49.670
a field or a lovely tree?

34:49.670 --> 34:51.630
Ha! No, I would not.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.174
I am not an orangutan.

34:54.175 --> 34:55.510
It's not even

34:55.511 --> 34:56.844
my spirit animal.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.849
Well, we'll let you, uh,

35:00.850 --> 35:02.349
rise to the challenge

35:02.350 --> 35:04.310
and embrace opportunities.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.731
I cannot work without my wind

35:07.732 --> 35:09.023
chimes.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.067
These will change

35:10.068 --> 35:11.109
your life, William.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.947
- So wait, you're
- telling us that you spent

35:15.948 --> 35:17.366
the last month making our lives

35:17.367 --> 35:18.783
a waking nightmare

35:18.784 --> 35:20.056
from which there was

35:20.057 --> 35:21.326
no escape, just so you two

35:21.327 --> 35:23.245
could be roomies again?

35:23.246 --> 35:24.769
But now you want our help to

35:24.770 --> 35:26.290
do the same thing to the girls?

35:26.291 --> 35:27.563
Maybe we owe you guys

35:27.564 --> 35:28.834
an apology.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.378
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe!

35:30.381 --> 35:31.797
- And Boots
- is working on that

35:31.800 --> 35:33.632
- Right now, okay,
- but the bottom line is,

35:33.635 --> 35:35.571
The longer the girls stay,

35:35.572 --> 35:37.509
the more Macdonald Hall changes.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.928
They have got to go.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.847
- And the girls
- Could not agree more.

35:40.850 --> 35:42.808
Don't touch me.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.894
Wait, really?

35:46.895 --> 35:47.896
Well, I don't know

35:47.897 --> 35:48.897
what you guys are serving

35:48.898 --> 35:49.940
in the buffeteria,

35:49.941 --> 35:50.982
but it isn't food.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.776
- And I don't know
- what buffeteria means,

35:52.779 --> 35:54.192
But it isn't a real word.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.194
- And one of your teachers
- scolded Diane

35:56.195 --> 35:58.156
- for digging a hole
- in the schoolyard.

35:58.159 --> 35:59.408
I was just trying to bury

35:59.409 --> 36:00.658
my metaphorical inhibitions.

36:02.829 --> 36:04.996
- Plus-and I mean this
- in the nicest way possible...

36:04.997 --> 36:06.561
I've smelled fast food dumpsters

36:06.562 --> 36:08.124
that stink less than you alls.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.647
That's true.

36:09.648 --> 36:11.168
That one's fair, actually.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.544
The gong is ready to go.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.422
- Oh no, we don't need that
- anymore, Wilbur.

36:14.425 --> 36:16.256
I actually already have a plan.

36:16.257 --> 36:19.344
Operation Fake Prank War.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.180
That's...

36:22.181 --> 36:23.181
that's brilliant.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.182
If Sturgeon

36:24.183 --> 36:25.183
and Scrimmage think

36:25.184 --> 36:26.581
the boys and the girls can't get

36:26.582 --> 36:27.977
along, they'll separate us.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.147
- Scrimmage will find us somewhere
- else to stay

36:30.150 --> 36:31.773
- While the school
- gets de-skunked.

36:31.776 --> 36:33.129
A motel, a trailer park,

36:33.130 --> 36:34.483
a ditch... anything would be

36:34.484 --> 36:36.069
an improvement. No offense.

36:36.070 --> 36:37.653
Guys,

36:37.654 --> 36:40.322
do I have to remind you?

36:40.323 --> 36:41.762
Bruno's plans don't

36:41.763 --> 36:43.200
always go as...

36:43.201 --> 36:45.452
planned.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.579
He's right.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.374
Sometimes they go better.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.793
Alright, let's go!

36:51.794 --> 36:53.210
Yeah!

36:53.211 --> 36:55.088
- Okay, let's just remember
- the ground rules.

36:55.091 --> 36:56.840
- That's right,
- where there are no rules,

36:56.843 --> 36:58.466
- Only losers and winners.
- No!

36:58.469 --> 36:59.593
That this is

36:59.594 --> 37:00.718
a fake prank war

37:00.719 --> 37:02.388
for Sturgeon's benefit.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.055
We don't want to hurt anyone.

37:04.056 --> 37:05.578
Right?

37:05.579 --> 37:07.099
Right.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.101
That too.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.437

Bruno!

Come on, come on!

40:08.825 --> 40:10.324
Wha...

40:10.325 --> 40:11.848
I've been thinking...

40:11.849 --> 40:13.369
Maybe we should pull back

40:13.370 --> 40:14.538
on this prank war.

40:14.539 --> 40:15.704
What? Why?

40:15.705 --> 40:17.332
- I just think it's
- getting out of hand.

40:17.335 --> 40:18.958
- I don't know what you're
- talking about.

40:18.961 --> 40:20.543
- This prank is going
- to be beautiful.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.024
What prank?

40:23.504 --> 40:24.839
No, no, don't!

40:24.840 --> 40:26.173
No! No!

40:26.174 --> 40:27.551
What's wrong? You can dish it

40:27.552 --> 40:28.926
out but you can't take it?

40:28.927 --> 40:30.137
Cathy!

40:30.138 --> 40:31.345
Guys!

40:33.306 --> 40:35.183
- I knew this
- would escalate!

40:35.186 --> 40:36.393
I'm doing this for you!

40:36.394 --> 40:37.601
Guys, stop!

40:37.602 --> 40:39.062
You're gonna break it!

40:39.063 --> 40:40.520
Walton, what are you doing?

40:40.521 --> 40:43.190
Guys! Guys, look!

40:48.613 --> 40:49.865
Who would leave

40:49.866 --> 40:51.116
this lovely box here?

40:54.183 --> 40:55.244
No, no, no!

40:55.245 --> 40:57.580
What?

41:01.793 --> 41:03.419
Nuts.

41:03.420 --> 41:06.004
Now, Mr. Sturgeon and I

41:06.005 --> 41:07.486
understand that this has been

41:07.487 --> 41:08.966
a difficult time.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.717
Actually, "we" don't.

41:12.263 --> 41:13.804
- I think what William
- is trying to say

41:13.805 --> 41:15.348
is that we feel

41:15.349 --> 41:16.890
your confusion.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.143
Hmm... no, I'm not.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.104
I'm too busy feeling

41:21.105 --> 41:23.063
very, very pink.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.253
Sir, I think I can

41:24.254 --> 41:25.441
speak for all of us

41:25.442 --> 41:26.547
when I say pink is

41:26.548 --> 41:27.651
definitely your color.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.612
- And I think I can speak
- for all of us when I say

41:29.615 --> 41:31.135
This is entirely Bruno's fault.

41:31.136 --> 41:32.656
My fault?

41:32.657 --> 41:33.700
Who was the one who put

41:33.701 --> 41:34.741
all the moustaches

41:34.742 --> 41:35.743
and wigs all over Chris'

41:35.744 --> 41:36.744
masterpieces?

41:36.745 --> 41:37.933
Well, who's the one that

41:37.934 --> 41:39.121
painted the entire staircase

41:39.122 --> 41:40.228
that I walked into?

41:40.229 --> 41:41.332
I've still got a headache.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.210
Oh, I have something for that.

41:43.211 --> 41:45.085
Where is my wet noise generator?

41:45.086 --> 41:47.545
Oh, it's drying out.

41:47.546 --> 41:48.964
On the roof.

41:48.965 --> 41:50.571
The thing I don't understand

41:50.572 --> 41:52.176
is... I thought

41:52.177 --> 41:53.220
you all liked each other.

41:53.221 --> 41:54.261
We do.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.930
I mean, we're friends.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.475
Arguable.

42:00.018 --> 42:01.601
Mr. Sturgeon,

42:01.602 --> 42:03.312
Ms. Scrimmage,

42:03.313 --> 42:05.002
we only did all this to show you

42:05.003 --> 42:06.690
that we couldn't get along

42:06.691 --> 42:08.068
so you would split us

42:08.069 --> 42:09.443
back up and...

42:09.444 --> 42:10.445
everything would go

42:10.446 --> 42:11.446
back to normal.

42:12.657 --> 42:13.864
I guess it just...

42:13.865 --> 42:16.159
got out of hand.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.454
That is the most...

42:19.455 --> 42:20.829
Idiotic,

42:20.830 --> 42:23.207
harebrained, impossible...

42:23.208 --> 42:25.189
Poignant, understandable,

42:25.190 --> 42:27.169
beautiful...

42:27.170 --> 42:29.087
Beautiful...

42:29.088 --> 42:31.132
- Wait, what?
- Well, William, we're the ones

42:31.135 --> 42:32.884
Who forced them to do this,

42:32.885 --> 42:34.634
so this is really our fault.

42:34.635 --> 42:35.824
Is this really happening?

42:35.825 --> 42:37.012
Oh, and it gets better.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.035
Watch.

42:38.036 --> 42:39.056
Wait a minute.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.579
I'm not the reason I got

42:40.580 --> 42:42.100
pink powder up my nose.

42:42.101 --> 42:44.062
Aren't you, William?

42:44.063 --> 42:46.021
In your heart.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.274
I think it's time to let

42:47.275 --> 42:48.524
bygones be bygones.

42:48.525 --> 42:49.776
We have so much to learn

42:49.777 --> 42:51.026
from each other...

42:51.027 --> 42:52.862
which we could do at

42:52.863 --> 42:54.696
a coed equinox gathering

42:54.697 --> 42:57.658
of movement and co-mingling!

43:00.119 --> 43:01.391
I believe what she's trying

43:01.392 --> 43:02.662
to say is a dance, and no,

43:02.663 --> 43:04.999
- I don't think this is the right
- time for that, Eugenia.

43:05.002 --> 43:06.438
Nonsense! It's a perfect way

43:06.439 --> 43:07.876
to let off some steam

43:07.877 --> 43:09.567
through vigorous

43:09.568 --> 43:11.255
rhythmic activity.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.632
Yeah, actually, I think that

43:12.633 --> 43:14.007
would be a really good way

43:14.008 --> 43:15.030
for everyone to just...

43:15.031 --> 43:16.051
get along again.

43:17.117 --> 43:18.178
Really.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.764
Do you think that's

43:19.765 --> 43:21.348
possible, hm? Walton?

43:21.349 --> 43:23.725
Ms. Burton?

43:24.791 --> 43:25.853
Absolutely.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.275
Come on! Rubber chicken,

43:31.276 --> 43:33.569
Cayenne pepper, bird's nest...

43:33.570 --> 43:35.695
There is no way

43:35.696 --> 43:37.052
that evil girl's not

43:37.053 --> 43:38.407
planning something.

43:38.408 --> 43:39.972
We have to be ready.

43:39.973 --> 43:41.535
Bruno, we literally just agreed

43:41.536 --> 43:42.975
to let bygones be bygones.

43:42.976 --> 43:44.413
Which we'll do,

43:44.414 --> 43:46.354
but if they start bygoning

43:46.355 --> 43:48.292
again, we'll be ready.

43:48.293 --> 43:50.128
Ah, there you are!

43:50.129 --> 43:51.962
Old Faithful.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.923
- I've actually rigged it
- to a small battery

43:53.926 --> 43:55.258
So it's way more buzzy. Hope

43:55.259 --> 43:56.592
Diane doesn't have a pacemaker.

43:56.593 --> 43:57.740
No!

43:57.741 --> 43:58.885
Oh, come on!

43:58.886 --> 44:01.222
- Dude, it doesn't hurt that bad.
- I do it to myself.

44:01.225 --> 44:03.224
- Why do I get to have
- all of the fun, you know?

44:03.227 --> 44:04.371
Bruno, I mean

44:04.372 --> 44:05.517
no more pranks.

44:05.518 --> 44:07.145
No more revenge.

44:07.146 --> 44:08.770
It's over.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.815
Wait, what's over? Like, us?

44:11.816 --> 44:13.858
No, of course not!

44:13.859 --> 44:15.465
Just... we can deal with

44:15.466 --> 44:17.070
a little bit of change.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.156
It's only until

44:18.157 --> 44:19.239
the end of the year.

44:20.284 --> 44:21.325
Sorry, do you smell that?

44:23.495 --> 44:26.079
Oh yeah, it's you.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.248
Stinking and sounding

44:27.249 --> 44:28.415
like The Fish.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.563
Dude, I don't know what's

44:29.564 --> 44:30.708
happening to you anymore.

44:30.709 --> 44:32.378
- Maybe I just
- don't want everybody

44:32.381 --> 44:33.962
To end up hating everybody.

44:33.963 --> 44:35.152
Maybe I actually liked

44:35.153 --> 44:36.340
living with those other guys,

44:36.341 --> 44:37.405
doing different stuff.

44:37.406 --> 44:38.467
Since when?

44:38.468 --> 44:39.844
You were the one who was all,

44:39.845 --> 44:41.219
"I don't know what to do, Bruno.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.930
- I don't want change.
- I don't want to room

44:42.933 --> 44:44.473
With anybody else, Bruno!"

44:44.474 --> 44:45.704
Yeah, well, maybe I've

44:45.705 --> 44:46.933
changed. You know what,

44:46.934 --> 44:48.624
maybe The Fish was right.

44:48.625 --> 44:50.313
Maybe we should be apart.

44:55.569 --> 44:56.569
Oh wow!

44:58.489 --> 45:00.405
Ah! Okay.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.971
Oh, come now, William,

45:01.972 --> 45:03.534
it's going to be fun!

45:03.535 --> 45:05.307
Music, movement, mutual respect.

45:05.308 --> 45:07.078
Eugenia,

45:07.079 --> 45:08.727
in my not inconsiderable

45:08.728 --> 45:10.374
experience, I have found

45:10.375 --> 45:11.960
that forced gatherings

45:11.961 --> 45:13.544
meant to create amity

45:13.545 --> 45:15.005
usually do

45:15.006 --> 45:16.463
the exact opposite.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.090
Oh, you. What could

45:18.091 --> 45:19.715
possibly go wrong?

45:19.716 --> 45:20.864
What could go wrong?

45:20.865 --> 45:22.010
Where shall I start?

45:22.011 --> 45:23.200
It's like you're standing

45:23.201 --> 45:24.388
on the edge of a cliff

45:24.389 --> 45:25.765
and you can't help but take

45:25.766 --> 45:27.140
the extra step.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.122
And you're like a fussy man

45:29.123 --> 45:31.102
in a suit who doesn't believe

45:31.103 --> 45:32.563
that kids can

45:32.564 --> 45:34.022
have fun at a dance.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.942
You don't quite understand how

45:35.943 --> 45:37.859
analogies work, do you, Eugenia?

45:37.860 --> 45:39.735
Analogies are like kids.

45:39.736 --> 45:41.218
Sometimes you just have

45:41.219 --> 45:42.699
to trust them.

45:47.809 --> 45:49.538
Oh...

45:49.539 --> 45:53.125
♪ I want you by my side ♪

45:58.381 --> 46:00.756
You were saying?

46:00.757 --> 46:02.594
Ooh, dolphin!

46:04.387 --> 46:07.222
♪ I could barely hide ♪

46:07.223 --> 46:08.537
♪ I will fall for you

46:08.538 --> 46:09.849
That way ♪

46:09.850 --> 46:11.164
We could just go over there

46:11.165 --> 46:12.477
and ask them to dance.

46:12.478 --> 46:14.272
Or... just hear me out here, we

46:14.273 --> 46:16.064
could stay right here, and not.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.066
I like this plan.

46:17.067 --> 46:18.067
It's workable

46:18.068 --> 46:19.089
and it has a lower

46:19.090 --> 46:20.110
humiliation factor.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.967
OK, guys, what is the worst

46:21.968 --> 46:23.822
thing that is gonna happen?

46:27.702 --> 46:30.912
Okay, that's pretty bad.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.186
You know if we don't even try,

46:32.187 --> 46:33.457
Ms. Scrimmage will make us all

46:33.458 --> 46:35.376
- do a sharing circle
- about it tomorrow.

46:35.379 --> 46:36.503
Okay, I'd rather do

46:36.504 --> 46:37.628
a hot yoga sharing circle

46:37.629 --> 46:38.651
in a parka

46:38.652 --> 46:39.671
than let that guy

46:39.672 --> 46:40.777
have even one chance

46:40.778 --> 46:41.881
to laugh at us.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.676
Cathy, do you think

46:43.677 --> 46:45.469
you're maybe getting

46:45.470 --> 46:47.887
a little... obsessed?

46:47.888 --> 46:49.848
- I don't know what
- you're talking about.

47:00.025 --> 47:01.860
Cathy?

47:03.862 --> 47:05.343
Alright, how much longer do we

47:05.344 --> 47:06.822
have to force these children

47:06.823 --> 47:08.242
- to endure this?
- Oh!

47:08.245 --> 47:09.661
Hey, everybody!

47:09.664 --> 47:12.412
Are you ready to dance?

47:13.832 --> 47:15.248
Get this outta here!

47:15.249 --> 47:16.918
That's right, it's me,

47:16.919 --> 47:18.585
TV's Kip Kipperson,

47:18.586 --> 47:20.296
here to answer

47:20.297 --> 47:22.005
that age-old question...

47:22.006 --> 47:25.216
Boogie or Breakdown?

47:26.491 --> 47:27.761
No, no, no, no!

47:27.762 --> 47:28.825
I'm still picking cupcakes

47:28.826 --> 47:29.887
out of my ears.

47:29.888 --> 47:30.994
I don't know who's

47:30.995 --> 47:32.098
responsible for this,

47:32.099 --> 47:33.184
but it's just

47:33.185 --> 47:34.268
what we need.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.775
- I knew Walton would
- pull something.

47:40.778 --> 47:42.569
This has Burton written

47:42.570 --> 47:44.362
all over it. In pen.

47:46.531 --> 47:47.532
Now, I'm gonna ask

47:47.533 --> 47:48.533
two participants

47:48.534 --> 47:49.784
to come up here

47:49.785 --> 47:51.034
into our dance-agon

47:51.035 --> 47:52.140
and show us their

47:52.141 --> 47:53.244
most groovetastic moves

47:53.245 --> 47:54.746
while the rest of us

47:54.747 --> 47:56.249
and the viewers online

47:56.250 --> 47:57.749
make the decision: Boogie

47:57.750 --> 48:01.294
or Breakdown?

48:01.295 --> 48:02.692
Yes! Yes! Yes!

48:02.693 --> 48:04.088
No, no, no, no!

48:04.089 --> 48:05.466
Yes!

48:05.467 --> 48:06.842
Awesome!

48:06.843 --> 48:07.927
Now, what do you

48:07.928 --> 48:09.010
crazy kids have to say

48:09.011 --> 48:10.638
before you boogie

48:10.639 --> 48:12.263
or breakdown?

48:13.329 --> 48:14.391
Holy Mother!

48:14.392 --> 48:15.873
I have nothing to do with

48:15.874 --> 48:17.352
this, but I just wanna say

48:17.353 --> 48:18.834
thank you to whoever it was.

48:18.835 --> 48:20.313
Was it my girls?

48:20.314 --> 48:21.503
No!

48:21.504 --> 48:22.691
Let's just say

48:22.692 --> 48:24.860
it was a fun-nonymous tipster

48:24.861 --> 48:26.112
who knew that this place

48:26.113 --> 48:27.362
needed some funk in its trunk,

48:27.363 --> 48:29.156
some swing in its sting,

48:29.157 --> 48:30.948
some black in its blue.

48:30.949 --> 48:31.992
Now you're just

48:31.993 --> 48:33.034
talking nonsense.

48:33.035 --> 48:35.162
Hey, doesn't matter, we've got

48:35.163 --> 48:37.288
13 million YouTube followers!

48:38.833 --> 48:40.460
A Macdonald Hall headmaster

48:40.461 --> 48:42.085
does not bust moves.

48:42.086 --> 48:43.484
Get fly, bowtie!

48:43.485 --> 48:44.880
William, loosen up!

48:46.571 --> 48:48.258
Go Sturgeon!

49:26.798 --> 49:28.028
This is a trap!

49:28.029 --> 49:29.257
I can smell it!

49:29.258 --> 49:30.989
Hold on, girls!

49:30.990 --> 49:32.719
We didn't plan this!

50:26.231 --> 50:28.274
Ha-ha-ha!

50:28.275 --> 50:31.444
Such hijinks, such wild abandon!

50:31.445 --> 50:33.218
If only I could be

50:33.219 --> 50:34.991
part of such fun.

50:41.603 --> 50:42.874
Come on, Cathy!

50:52.299 --> 50:53.613
What are you doing here?

50:53.614 --> 50:54.926
I'm about to end this nightmare!

50:54.927 --> 50:57.262
Not before I do!

50:59.975 --> 51:01.474
Drop it, drop it!

51:10.006 --> 51:11.443
Drop it!

51:27.167 --> 51:28.920
Everybody, back!

51:51.297 --> 51:53.068
Is everybody okay? Everybody?

51:53.069 --> 51:55.194
Okay?

52:05.414 --> 52:08.207
Hello, Sturgeon.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.334
Hartley?

52:10.335 --> 52:12.295
What are you doing here?

52:12.296 --> 52:13.318
Oh, I think

52:13.319 --> 52:14.338
the real question is:

52:14.339 --> 52:16.340
what are you doing here?

52:16.341 --> 52:18.969
I'm headmaster of this school.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.054
Oh, really? And for how long?

52:21.055 --> 52:22.723
I would think that after

52:22.724 --> 52:24.390
a disastrous prank war,

52:24.391 --> 52:25.976
the last thing a responsible

52:25.977 --> 52:27.560
headmaster would do

52:27.561 --> 52:28.750
is hold a Boogie or Breakdown

52:28.751 --> 52:29.938
competition

52:29.939 --> 52:31.420
in front of 10 million

52:31.421 --> 52:32.899
YouTube viewers!

52:32.900 --> 52:35.068
Thirteen million.

52:35.069 --> 52:36.987
Oh, God.

52:36.988 --> 52:38.552
How would you even

52:38.553 --> 52:40.115
know about...

52:44.662 --> 52:46.226
Hello? Kip Kipperson, from

52:46.227 --> 52:47.789
Boogie or Breakdown Productions?

52:47.790 --> 52:49.791
Great. I have an event

52:49.792 --> 52:51.127
that I think you'd be

52:51.128 --> 52:52.460
Kip-tastic for.

52:54.379 --> 52:55.547
Diabolical laughter

52:55.548 --> 52:56.714
in the halls.

52:56.715 --> 52:57.716
Three demerits.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.266
I dig the use of "Kip-tastic",

53:07.267 --> 53:08.602
but you used dance

53:08.603 --> 53:09.936
for evil, man,

53:09.937 --> 53:11.562
and that is not cool with Kip.

53:11.563 --> 53:13.107
Eh.

53:18.194 --> 53:20.655
I just don't understand

53:20.656 --> 53:22.053
how you thought this was

53:22.054 --> 53:23.449
a good idea, Sturgeon.

53:23.450 --> 53:24.931
You know, it wasn't

53:24.932 --> 53:26.410
exactly my idea,

53:26.411 --> 53:28.121
Superintendent Snow.

53:28.122 --> 53:29.352
And that's the problem.

53:29.353 --> 53:30.581
You've lost control.

53:30.582 --> 53:32.251
Hosting the Scrimmage girls

53:32.252 --> 53:33.918
is one thing, but a prank war?

53:33.919 --> 53:36.671
An internet dance fiasco?

53:36.672 --> 53:37.882
And reports

53:37.883 --> 53:39.090
you were seen doing...

53:39.091 --> 53:41.092
the stanky leg?

53:42.845 --> 53:43.867
Hello, this is Eugenia

53:43.868 --> 53:44.888
Scrimmage and I think

53:44.889 --> 53:45.953
I can help.

53:45.954 --> 53:47.015
Oh, please don't.

53:47.016 --> 53:48.267
We have had some interesting

53:48.268 --> 53:49.517
transition challenges,

53:49.518 --> 53:50.936
it's nothing that a sharing

53:50.937 --> 53:52.353
circle couldn't sort out.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.897
Ms. Scrimmage, the Governing

53:53.898 --> 53:55.439
Board of Governance and I

53:55.440 --> 53:56.504
couldn't agree more.

53:56.505 --> 53:57.567
In fact, we are prepared

53:57.568 --> 53:58.902
to have our own sharing

53:58.903 --> 54:00.235
circle when we discuss

54:00.236 --> 54:01.822
who will run the Hall before

54:01.823 --> 54:03.407
someone gets seriously hurt.

54:05.076 --> 54:06.431
Surely you don't mean...

54:06.432 --> 54:07.785
firing me?

54:07.786 --> 54:09.016
That is one option

54:09.017 --> 54:10.245
on the table.

54:10.246 --> 54:11.790
We do have a very qualified

54:11.791 --> 54:13.332
replacement

54:13.333 --> 54:15.231
who is willing and able to...

54:15.232 --> 54:17.128
No. No, please, don't say...

54:17.129 --> 54:18.693
Hello, Sturgeon.

54:18.694 --> 54:20.255
Hartley.

54:20.256 --> 54:21.717
It's me, Rob Hartley.

54:21.718 --> 54:23.176
Yeah, I just said that.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.324
Oh.

54:24.325 --> 54:25.469
Mr. Hartley

54:25.470 --> 54:27.368
has some very interesting ideas

54:27.369 --> 54:29.264
about how better to serve

54:29.265 --> 54:31.476
- the students of Macdonald Hall.
- Mm-hmm.

54:31.479 --> 54:32.540
Oh, I'm sure he's very

54:32.541 --> 54:33.603
interested in my job,

54:33.604 --> 54:34.812
since he just lost his own.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.357
Well, you see,

54:36.358 --> 54:37.899
let me explain that.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.923
Like many great men before me,

54:39.924 --> 54:41.945
I was duped... duped, I say...

54:41.946 --> 54:43.988
By cougar traffickers,

54:43.989 --> 54:45.261
but all charges were

54:45.262 --> 54:46.532
dropped, Sturgeon,

54:46.533 --> 54:47.806
when I agreed to testify

54:47.807 --> 54:49.077
against everyone,

54:49.078 --> 54:50.996
- including people
- I've never met before.

54:50.999 --> 54:52.769
So all's well that ends well.

54:52.770 --> 54:54.540
We can discuss

54:54.541 --> 54:56.418
all of this, including just who

54:56.419 --> 54:58.293
is best suited to run the Hall,

54:58.294 --> 55:00.504
when the Board meets at the Hall

55:00.505 --> 55:02.506
tomorrow. Hartley?

55:02.507 --> 55:03.988
Mm-hmm. I wouldn't

55:03.989 --> 55:05.468
miss it for the world.

55:08.097 --> 55:09.390
Your evil is

55:09.391 --> 55:10.681
showing, Hartley.

55:10.682 --> 55:13.184
Oh. Thought I'd hung up.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.105
Still on, Hartley.

55:17.106 --> 55:18.689
Oh.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.734
Tomorrow, Sturgeon.

55:22.611 --> 55:23.758
We will support you,

55:23.759 --> 55:24.904
William, don't worry.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.198
My girls, myself,

55:26.199 --> 55:27.490
my entire school...

55:27.491 --> 55:29.492
We will all be behind you.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.869
Eugenia,

55:31.870 --> 55:33.246
I'm right over here.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.129
William,

55:40.130 --> 55:41.754
are you alright?

55:41.755 --> 55:43.403
I told my boys

55:43.404 --> 55:45.049
that change was good,

55:45.050 --> 55:46.551
- that it was a necessary
- part of life

55:46.554 --> 55:48.344
- And they could
- deal with it and...

55:48.347 --> 55:49.721
And you were right.

55:49.722 --> 55:51.097
No, I was wrong!

55:51.098 --> 55:53.766
I was very wrong.

55:53.767 --> 55:56.186
Now I have to fix it.

55:56.187 --> 55:58.856
Somehow.

56:06.071 --> 56:07.865
Where did you

56:07.866 --> 56:09.657
learn those moves?

56:09.658 --> 56:12.243
Don't you wanna see, Cathy?

56:12.244 --> 56:14.162
Everyone's having a blast.

56:14.163 --> 56:15.998
Okay, where you see a blast,

56:15.999 --> 56:17.832
I see another Bruno Walton plot.

56:17.833 --> 56:19.022
Yeah, well,

56:19.023 --> 56:20.210
we sure see something.

56:20.211 --> 56:22.170
Girls, we need to talk.

56:22.171 --> 56:23.838
I'll get the sharing stick.

56:23.839 --> 56:24.840
I'd like to propose

56:24.841 --> 56:25.841
another study session:

56:25.842 --> 56:27.030
revenge and its practical

56:27.031 --> 56:28.218
applications.

56:28.219 --> 56:29.387
Diane, forget the stick.

56:29.388 --> 56:30.553
And I'm not here to talk

56:30.554 --> 56:32.514
- about a study session.
- I'm here to say that,

56:32.517 --> 56:33.703
For the first time

56:33.704 --> 56:34.891
in my life as an educator

56:34.892 --> 56:36.477
and an awakening

56:36.478 --> 56:38.061
specialist, that I am...

56:38.062 --> 56:40.105
disappointed.

56:41.899 --> 56:43.275
In who?

56:43.276 --> 56:44.650
Yeah, tell us

56:44.651 --> 56:46.341
and they're done.

56:46.342 --> 56:48.029
In you girls and your behavior.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.447
But I...

56:50.448 --> 56:52.491
I don't understand.

56:52.492 --> 56:54.370
Is this what

56:54.371 --> 56:56.246
they call... criticism?

56:56.247 --> 56:57.873
Yes, it is, and I think

56:57.874 --> 56:59.498
you all need some.

56:59.499 --> 57:01.063
Mr. Sturgeon opened up

57:01.064 --> 57:02.626
his hall to us

57:02.627 --> 57:04.045
in our time of need,

57:04.046 --> 57:05.462
and how have we repaid him?

57:05.463 --> 57:07.631
Through prank wars

57:07.632 --> 57:09.592
and dance disasters

57:09.593 --> 57:10.845
and horrible manners!

57:10.846 --> 57:12.095
Manners?

57:12.096 --> 57:13.660
What is this supposed to be, a

57:13.661 --> 57:15.223
young ladies' finishing school?

57:15.224 --> 57:16.267
I thought you wanted

57:16.268 --> 57:17.308
strong, independent women

57:17.309 --> 57:18.977
that take...

57:18.978 --> 57:20.644
I do Strong independent women

57:20.645 --> 57:22.126
know how to treat their friends,

57:22.127 --> 57:23.606
which is apparently something

57:23.607 --> 57:26.234
you don't know how to do.

57:35.078 --> 57:37.318
- Oh, nice try, but I'm still
- not talking to you, dude.

57:38.081 --> 57:39.622
- Yeah, well, I didn't ask
- for this meeting, you did.

57:39.623 --> 57:40.979
Wrong again, Melvin.

57:40.980 --> 57:42.333
Yeah, that's right,

57:42.334 --> 57:44.628
- I'm so mad at you I'm not even
- using your cool nickname,

57:44.631 --> 57:46.422
- Which I gave you.
- Wait.

57:46.425 --> 57:47.736
If I didn't set this up

57:47.737 --> 57:49.048
and you didn't set this up,

57:49.049 --> 57:50.321
then who set this up?

57:50.322 --> 57:51.592
We did.

57:51.593 --> 57:53.199
We need to talk,

57:53.200 --> 57:54.804
all of us.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.432
- I'd rather eat dirt
- than talk to her.

57:56.435 --> 57:58.392
- Oh, I can arrange that.
- Stop!

57:58.395 --> 57:59.915
Guys, Sturgeon might get fired

57:59.916 --> 58:01.436
because we can't get along.

58:01.437 --> 58:03.355
- Fired?
- What do you mean?

58:03.358 --> 58:04.815
How do you know?

58:07.443 --> 58:08.569
When Scrimmage came

58:08.570 --> 58:09.693
and gave us a lecture...

58:09.694 --> 58:11.217
Wait, wait.

58:11.218 --> 58:12.738
Scrimmage lectured you?

58:12.739 --> 58:15.116
Yeah, pretty freaky.

58:15.117 --> 58:16.139
So we checked around,

58:16.140 --> 58:17.160
talked to some

58:17.161 --> 58:18.329
of our resources... we can't

58:18.330 --> 58:19.495
really tell you who,

58:19.496 --> 58:20.873
it's hush-hush, but...

58:20.874 --> 58:22.248
We asked Mrs. Davis.

58:22.249 --> 58:23.605
The Board's meeting tomorrow

58:23.606 --> 58:24.959
to decide if Sturgeon goes

58:24.960 --> 58:26.295
and Hartley

58:26.296 --> 58:27.628
takes his place.

58:27.629 --> 58:29.381
Whoa, The Fish can be a real

58:29.382 --> 58:31.132
pain in the pants sometimes...

58:31.133 --> 58:32.593
Yeah, but no way the Hall

58:32.594 --> 58:34.052
would deserve Hartley.

58:35.595 --> 58:36.742
This is all our fault.

58:36.743 --> 58:37.888
No,

58:37.889 --> 58:39.245
I'd say it's 30% us,

58:39.246 --> 58:40.599
70% the Scrimmage girls.

58:40.600 --> 58:41.914
Oh my...

58:41.915 --> 58:43.227
But who's counting, right?

58:43.228 --> 58:44.730
Well, 100% of us

58:44.731 --> 58:46.231
need to do something.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.089
She's right. Thankfully,

58:49.090 --> 58:50.360
I have a plan.

58:50.361 --> 58:51.508
Bruno!

58:51.509 --> 58:52.653
It's risky, you know,

58:52.654 --> 58:54.052
and may involve military

58:54.053 --> 58:55.448
vehicles and a lot of penguins...

58:55.449 --> 58:58.242
We do nothing.

58:58.243 --> 58:59.766
Boots, if we don't

58:59.767 --> 59:01.287
do anything,

59:01.288 --> 59:02.705
Sturgeon could get fired

59:02.706 --> 59:04.666
- and Hartley would be - running the Hall.
- No.

59:04.669 --> 59:06.292
He's right.

59:06.293 --> 59:07.753
Everything we've been doing,

59:07.754 --> 59:09.212
it all has to stop.

59:09.213 --> 59:10.401
But when Sturgeon

59:10.402 --> 59:11.588
is having that meeting,

59:11.589 --> 59:12.653
the Hall needs to be

59:12.654 --> 59:13.716
the quietest,

59:13.717 --> 59:15.010
best school

59:15.011 --> 59:16.302
in the country.

59:18.285 --> 59:20.264
So no pranks and no revenge.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.099
Okay.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.727
- Just to be clear,
- I'm still mad at you.

59:23.730 --> 59:25.395
Yeah, me too.

59:25.396 --> 59:26.898
We still have to tell the boys.

59:26.899 --> 59:28.398
And I'll tell the girls.

59:28.399 --> 59:29.608
For one day in

59:29.609 --> 59:30.816
the Hall's history,

59:30.817 --> 59:32.943
no surprises.

59:35.406 --> 59:37.449
You gotta be kidding me!

59:43.621 --> 59:44.831
A hot air balloon?

59:51.213 --> 59:53.048
It is I, crown prince

59:53.049 --> 59:54.882
of Malbonia, Francisco Diaz.

59:54.883 --> 59:56.802
I ran away to come here

59:56.803 --> 59:58.719
to be a Macdonald Hall boy

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.889
like you said I should, Bruno.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:05.394
So, where's all

01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:06.769
the fun to be had?

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.854
You were right.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.899
It does taste like stardust.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.942
So funny!

01:00:14.633 --> 01:00:16.320
What's the problem, Smith?

01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:17.427
George isn't a big fan

01:00:17.428 --> 01:00:18.531
of the homeless.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:19.575
I mean, where

01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:20.616
do they even live?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.640
But that's not what my look

01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:24.661
of horror is about, O'Neal.

01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.018
Am I the only one here who

01:00:26.019 --> 01:00:27.374
follows international news?

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.961
Of course I am.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:34.464
People of Malbonia,

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:35.716
something terrible

01:00:35.717 --> 01:00:36.966
has happened.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.842
Late last night,

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:39.928
our beloved prince regent

01:00:39.929 --> 01:00:41.011
Francisco

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.076
was taken

01:00:42.077 --> 01:00:43.139
from Castle Malbonia

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.016
by some unscrupulous monsters

01:00:46.017 --> 01:00:48.291
who left a note with

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:50.563
only one word: Canada.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.253
Franny, did you

01:00:52.254 --> 01:00:53.941
write that note?

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:55.692
The Prime Minister

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.612
of this strange and exotic land

01:00:57.613 --> 01:00:59.530
has agreed to help us.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.991
Rest assured, my people,

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.514
when we find out

01:01:03.515 --> 01:01:05.035
where Francisco is,

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:06.350
there will be terrible

01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:07.663
consequences.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.914
Awesome.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.209
Remember Malbonia's

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:11.501
royal motto:

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.088
Never forget. Never forgive.

01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:16.672
Never forget, never forgive.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.675
Okay.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.365
Wait, you ran away!

01:01:21.366 --> 01:01:23.053
This isn't our fault!

01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.680
This is a fair point.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.016
- We just need to take him
- to the Malbonia Embassy

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.206
and explain what happened.

01:01:28.207 --> 01:01:29.393
No!

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:31.395
I came here to have fun.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.856
Malbonia is so boring.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.505
I wanna be a Hall boy.

01:01:35.506 --> 01:01:37.151
I can live right here.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.320
Uh, no, no, no, no, no,

01:01:38.321 --> 01:01:39.487
absolutely not.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:40.864
There's already a waiting list

01:01:40.865 --> 01:01:42.239
to be one of my interns. He...

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.596
Francisco, when you become king,

01:01:43.597 --> 01:01:44.950
you're gonna be able

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.369
to do whatever you want.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.786
But I already know

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:48.893
what I want! I wanna stay

01:01:48.894 --> 01:01:49.997
here, be a Hall boy,

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.333
and make hijinks with Bruno

01:01:51.334 --> 01:01:52.667
and Boots forever.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.336
But Franny, we're not

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:56.003
gonna stay here forever,

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:57.506
'cause at some point,

01:01:57.507 --> 01:01:59.007
everything's gonna change.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.971
Whether we like it or not.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:11.061
We have to fix this

01:02:11.062 --> 01:02:12.978
before the Hall becomes

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:14.022
the middle of

01:02:14.023 --> 01:02:15.064
an international incident

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.773
and The Fish gets blamed!

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:18.172
But even if you do,

01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:19.569
to save Sturgeon, you need

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.030
to convince the Board and unless

01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:22.488
one of you is a member, which...

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.719
Well, I do have

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:24.948
an aunt and uncle on it.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:26.117
So they can come and talk

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:27.284
to the Board tomorrow!

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:29.870
No, no, no, no, no,

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:30.956
there's no time!

01:02:30.957 --> 01:02:32.039
They live in Singapore!

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.437
They haven't been back to

01:02:33.438 --> 01:02:34.833
the Hall in over 20 years.

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:35.940
There may have been

01:02:35.941 --> 01:02:37.044
some legal issues.

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:38.171
Of course there were.

01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:39.296
You know how it is...

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.258
- You run one billion-dollar
- Ponzi scheme,

01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:43.156
Suddenly you're the bad guy.

01:02:43.157 --> 01:02:45.052
Cathy...

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.054
I know that look.

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:49.640
So do I. Bruno...

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.663
you have a crazy plan,

01:02:50.664 --> 01:02:51.684
don't you?

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.291
Feel like dressing up as a

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.895
certain aunt and uncle, Burton?

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.502
Maybe, Walton. You feel like

01:02:56.503 --> 01:02:58.107
making an impassioned case

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.735
to the Board, convincing them

01:02:59.736 --> 01:03:01.360
that The Fish must stay?

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.675
That is the craziest thing

01:03:02.676 --> 01:03:03.987
I have ever heard

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:05.240
and there is no way it is gonna

01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:06.490
work the way you think it is.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.805
Of course not.

01:03:07.806 --> 01:03:09.118
But whatever does happen,

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.454
Burton and I will

01:03:10.455 --> 01:03:11.787
figure it out. Together.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.296
Come on, George.

01:03:19.297 --> 01:03:20.797
Didn't wanna touch you.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:24.341
For the muffins!

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.677
I mean... for the Hall!

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:29.139
You're absolutely right, Franny.

01:03:29.142 --> 01:03:30.265
- Break!
- Yes!

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:37.711
Peaceful and quiet.

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.692
As long as that lasts.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.445
William, I'm sure everything

01:03:43.446 --> 01:03:45.195
is going to be fine.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:46.761
Really, Eugenia?

01:03:46.762 --> 01:03:48.324
What exactly in the past month

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.139
has given you confidence

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.952
to say that? Hm?

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.871
Ms. Davis,

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:57.874
bring me... the speech.

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:00.753
Are you sure, Mr. Sturgeon?

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.838
Absolutely.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:05.257
What is the speech?

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:20.940
Ready?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.777
- Three,
- One,

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.007
Two, one.

01:04:25.008 --> 01:04:26.237
Two, three.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.599
What is that?

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.329
This...

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.873
is the speech that

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:38.415
Willy gave to the Board

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:39.876
when he first interviewed

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:41.335
for the job, and they said

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:43.171
it was the best speech they'd

01:04:43.172 --> 01:04:45.005
ever heard about Macdonald Hall

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.174
that didn't rhyme.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.802
And sometimes, on a clear night,

01:04:48.803 --> 01:04:50.427
you can still hear the words

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.763
echoing down the halls.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:55.098
And by Mackenzie's beard,

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.100
these words shall echo again.

01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:58.290
William, I'm sure

01:04:58.291 --> 01:04:59.478
it's a very nice speech,

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.169
but haven't you changed a lot

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.857
since you first started? Grown?

01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:04.276
Blossomed, even? Don't you think

01:05:04.277 --> 01:05:05.693
you should talk about that?

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:06.903
Don't touch it!

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:08.111
Oh!

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:09.176
Eugenia, I think

01:05:09.177 --> 01:05:10.239
I've done enough change.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.262
It's time to go

01:05:11.263 --> 01:05:12.282
with what works.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.785
Tradition.

01:05:13.786 --> 01:05:15.285
History.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:19.289
"To my fellow educators.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.958
"A full education means

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:24.169
an ethical education."

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.171
And of course tradition,

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.340
the very foundation on which

01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:28.507
Macdonald Hall is built...

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:29.530
Nice words, Sturgeon,

01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:30.551
but you can save it

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:31.886
for when we get inside.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:32.929
Oh, don't be too hard

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.970
on him, Ms. Snow.

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:35.160
I'm sure

01:05:35.161 --> 01:05:36.348
Headmaster Sturgeon

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.226
- will do everything
- he can to keep his job.

01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:39.957
Not everything, Hartley.

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:41.687
Just the right thing.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:43.440
We'll see about

01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:45.191
that, won't we?

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:49.654
Fish.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.471
Yes, I went there.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.745
Snow?

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.874
Please.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.168
I can't believe it!

01:06:03.169 --> 01:06:04.460
I, Francisco Diaz,

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:05.483
crown prince of Malbonia,

01:06:05.484 --> 01:06:06.503
involved

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:07.526
in a legendary

01:06:07.527 --> 01:06:08.547
Macdonald Hall caper.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.507
That's pretty exciting.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.218
- If you guys don't stop
- distracting me,

01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:14.220
It'll be pretty over soon.

01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:28.108
So long as Diane's drone

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:30.236
- can get the keys, we should be
- able to drive the prince

01:06:30.239 --> 01:06:31.446
Out of here before the board

01:06:31.447 --> 01:06:32.655
meeting is even finished.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.907
And since I'm driving,

01:06:33.908 --> 01:06:35.157
you know what that means.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:37.390
We can test vehicular velocity

01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:39.620
as it relates to wind drag?

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:41.789
No, man! Drive-thru!

01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:44.207
I envy you, Wilbur.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.626
For your simple pleasures.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:46.670
There is nothing simple

01:06:46.671 --> 01:06:47.711
about this.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.840
- We have about an hour to hit up
- ten places between here

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:51.154
And the embassy. We'll need

01:06:51.155 --> 01:06:52.466
some serious coordination.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.802
Whereas I chose my life's

01:06:53.803 --> 01:06:55.135
passion: science.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:57.095
Yes, she has betrayed me.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.097
Everybody else's

01:06:58.098 --> 01:06:59.098
prank worked,

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:02.559
but my Viscositizer... nothing!

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.583
The irony, it stings...

01:07:04.584 --> 01:07:06.605
like iron.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:09.232
Uh-huh.

01:07:09.233 --> 01:07:11.485
So, about that drive-thru?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:13.529
Chris, we gotta move.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.698
Time to do your magic.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.201
I'm assuming this

01:07:17.202 --> 01:07:18.701
is all unionized?

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:30.985
Why is he smiling

01:07:30.986 --> 01:07:32.172
like that, Walton?

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.404
We're usually the ones

01:07:33.405 --> 01:07:34.633
with the big crazy smiles.

01:07:34.634 --> 01:07:35.926
Yeah, I know.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.679
- It's kind of weird
- to look at.

01:07:37.682 --> 01:07:40.015
Chris, what are you thinking?

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:46.145
And of course, what would a

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:48.104
Macdonald Hall board meeting be

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:49.273
without my renowned

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:50.440
tea biscuits?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.568
Ms. Snow?

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:53.591
Why don't you take two?

01:07:53.592 --> 01:07:54.611
Nobody's looking.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.490
Looks like Mr. Sturgeon forgot

01:07:58.491 --> 01:07:59.805
about your extreme gluten

01:07:59.806 --> 01:08:01.117
allergy, Ms. Snow.

01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.286
Carrot stick?

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:03.454
Thank you.

01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:13.380
Stress eating again, Sturgeon?

01:08:14.592 --> 01:08:15.799
Alright, alright.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.260
Let's get this show on the road.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:18.719
Wait!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.451
Don't start without us!

01:08:20.452 --> 01:08:22.180
We are on the board, too.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.453
Hello, everyone!

01:08:23.455 --> 01:08:24.725
Charlie Wexford,

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:25.977
and this is my beautiful wife

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.227
Brunhilda.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.729
- Sorry to be late.
- Hello.

01:08:33.361 --> 01:08:34.944
- Yes, sorry
- to be late, yes.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.634
I'm sure if I was allowed to go

01:08:36.635 --> 01:08:38.321
to the Hall, Mr. Sturgeon

01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:39.365
would've taught me

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:40.407
about arriving on time.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:42.408
And freshly baked goods!

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.327
This takes leadership, you know.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.537
Well, speaking

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:46.747
about leadership,

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:47.978
let's discuss it, shall we?

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:49.207
Ah!

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.585
Fantastic idea!

01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:51.962
Let's.

01:09:07.374 --> 01:09:08.603
What is that horrible noise?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.148
The keys!

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:14.943
You did it!

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:16.026
Was there ever any doubt?

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:18.154
- Not in you.
- Alright, now let's get everyone

01:09:18.157 --> 01:09:19.990
- Back to the parking lot,
- and Wilbur and Elmer

01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:21.658
- Can drive this kid
- back to his embassy.

01:09:21.661 --> 01:09:23.158
- But I've barely
- had any adventure!

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:24.368
It's not over yet, Franny.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.916
- The Viscositizer had three
- main elements

01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:31.584
- Meant to work
- in perfect harmony:

01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:33.252
Mechanical, chemical, and

01:09:33.254 --> 01:09:34.920
what I like to call awesome.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.881
It...

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.113
Why does it feel like

01:09:40.115 --> 01:09:41.426
I'm at the dentist?

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:44.638
Get it? Laughing gas!

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.932
Why can't I work?

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:55.755
They're fine.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:57.359
Just sleeping.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.070
- What is this place?
- Some kind

01:09:59.073 --> 01:10:00.154
Of infernal Canadian

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:01.237
kidnapping academy?

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:02.469
Once we have

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.699
what we came for,

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.556
we will free all the children.

01:10:05.557 --> 01:10:07.410
For Malbonia!

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.441
And now, I think

01:10:15.442 --> 01:10:17.129
the Board is ready

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.736
to hear statements

01:10:18.737 --> 01:10:20.340
from headmaster Sturgeon,

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:22.259
- followed
- by Mr. Hartley,

01:10:22.262 --> 01:10:24.095
- On what they
- think is best

01:10:24.098 --> 01:10:26.930
For Macdonald Hall.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.850
Sturgeon!

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:36.815
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:39.089
Honor and tradition...

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.362
are the, uh...

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:43.907
Oh, no.

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:46.825
Are the, uh...

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.452
Excuse me

01:10:49.453 --> 01:10:51.080
just one moment, please,

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.706
if you could. I, uh...

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:54.917
Well, if Mr. Sturgeonpants

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.836
- doesn't seem to be ready
- for this meeting

01:10:56.839 --> 01:10:58.296
which he's known about since

01:10:58.297 --> 01:10:59.755
yesterday, but who's counting?

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.925
Perhaps I could go first.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.053
Yes, please do.

01:11:05.054 --> 01:11:06.179
Ah!

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:18.148
We'll see about that, won't we?

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:19.943
Fish.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:27.908
What does this Hall

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.598
deserve? Well,

01:11:29.599 --> 01:11:31.286
unlike my friend here,

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.997
I can think of a few words

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:34.706
right off the top of my head.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.251
Words like "tradition"

01:11:36.252 --> 01:11:37.793
and "honor".

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.045
I just finished saying

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:40.295
those exact words.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.548
Let the man speak, Sturgeon.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.260
Thank you, Ms. Snow.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.432
What's going on?

01:11:51.433 --> 01:11:52.682
My initial findings

01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:53.914
would suggest some sort

01:11:53.915 --> 01:11:55.145
of sleeping gas.

01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:01.942
Just before I passed out,

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.194
I think I remember

01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:04.444
some soldiers.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.801
They were all wearing these

01:12:05.802 --> 01:12:07.156
funny black slippers.

01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:08.888
Soldiers?

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:10.617
Black funny slippers... ninjas?

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.308
Cool!

01:12:12.309 --> 01:12:13.996
The Hall's in trouble. Not cool.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.519
Stealing keys and smuggling in

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.040
underage dignitaries

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:19.584
is one thing, but... ninjas?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:20.962
Sturgeon and Bruno and Cathy

01:12:20.963 --> 01:12:22.337
are still in that meeting.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.569
Maybe we should,

01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:24.798
like, warn them?

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:26.301
Yeah, but...

01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:27.801
ninjas!

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:29.845
Do my ears deceive me?

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.056
- You have the greatest school
- in all of the world,

01:12:32.059 --> 01:12:33.203
And yet you are afraid

01:12:33.204 --> 01:12:34.349
to defend it?

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.622
Well, I am not.

01:12:35.623 --> 01:12:36.894
For the Hall!

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.295
You know what?

01:12:41.296 --> 01:12:42.524
He's right.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:43.735
Our school

01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:44.943
is the greatest.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.404
So let's go save our school

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:47.864
and our friends.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:51.534
Sorry, who's that

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:52.826
crazy kid again?

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:53.870
It is he,

01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:54.911
Francisco Diaz,

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.873
crown prince of Malbonia.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.709
- The one you're doing
- all this for?

01:12:59.712 --> 01:13:01.064
Oh no, I'm just in it

01:13:01.065 --> 01:13:02.418
for the drive-thru.

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:04.587
OK, let's go get him.

01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:06.632
Let's go, buddy.

01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:11.553
Yup, definitely sleeping gas.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.597
Which means we're in trouble...

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:17.934
and I know just what we need!

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.853
And that is what a school

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:21.126
like Macdonald Hall

01:13:21.127 --> 01:13:22.397
needs in a headmaster,

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:25.608
which you will get in me,

01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:27.903
William Theodore Stur...

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.323
Uh, Robert Jeremiah Hartley.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:32.596
Oh!

01:13:32.597 --> 01:13:33.867
Thank you.

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:37.287
Excellent speech, Hartley.

01:13:38.561 --> 01:13:39.831
Thank you.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:40.979
The Hall will be

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.125
in excellent hands

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.169
if run by the man

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.211
who wrote that.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:46.129
Alright, William,

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.340
if you have anything

01:13:47.341 --> 01:13:48.549
else to add...

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:51.615
Well...

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.512
Um...

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.806
I suppose that anybody

01:13:56.807 --> 01:14:00.894
that is fa... familiar, uh,

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.021
with the, um...

01:14:04.754 --> 01:14:06.482
I'm not a big fan of, uh...

01:14:06.483 --> 01:14:08.902
improvisation. In some ways,

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:11.196
I find that, um...

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.699
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.199
I, Brunhilda Wexford,

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.472
would like to... would like

01:14:15.473 --> 01:14:16.743
to say a few words

01:14:16.744 --> 01:14:18.017
on behalf of The Fi... uh,

01:14:18.018 --> 01:14:19.288
Headmaster Sturgeon.

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:20.832
No! Maybe not

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.374
the right time for...

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.959
My dear,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.004
dear nephew, George,

01:14:26.005 --> 01:14:28.046
well, to be honest,

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.486
is not my favorite person in

01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:30.924
the world... bit of a snob really.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.385
Brunhilda, Brunhilda,

01:14:32.386 --> 01:14:33.843
stay focused, dear.

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:35.971
Yes, right.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:38.140
This isn't about George.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.955
It isn't even really

01:14:39.956 --> 01:14:41.768
about Headmaster Sturgeon.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:45.439
This is about change. Right.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:47.317
Do you remember those things

01:14:47.318 --> 01:14:49.192
we used to say to the kids?

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.653
You know: "Change is a part

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.906
"of growing up

01:14:52.907 --> 01:14:54.156
and it's a part of life,

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.617
and change helps us grow..."

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.832
Ha! New heels.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.606
Let's be honest.

01:15:05.607 --> 01:15:07.002
Change isn't good.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.755
Change means losing

01:15:08.756 --> 01:15:10.505
what you're used to.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.028
We had to change our mascot.

01:15:12.029 --> 01:15:13.549
No fun, believe me.

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.386
You know, I think perhaps this

01:15:15.387 --> 01:15:17.220
is not the best time to talk...

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:18.660
But that doesn't mean

01:15:18.661 --> 01:15:20.098
it isn't gonna happen anyways,

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:21.557
to all of us,

01:15:21.558 --> 01:15:23.206
and there's nobody better

01:15:23.207 --> 01:15:24.853
at helping with that

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.939
than Mr. Sturgeon.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:31.485
I know. I mean, uh,

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:33.050
George has told me

01:15:33.051 --> 01:15:34.612
that Headmaster Sturgeon

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.261
understands that kids make

01:15:36.262 --> 01:15:37.907
mistakes and they mess up,

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:41.619
right? Even temporarily...

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.372
take down a school or two, huh?

01:15:43.373 --> 01:15:45.123
Isn't that right?

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:48.584
He cares about us.

01:15:48.585 --> 01:15:52.755
Some change is good. Some isn't.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:54.362
Macdonald Hall without

01:15:54.363 --> 01:15:55.967
Headmaster Sturgeon...

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.637
Ha!

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:59.304
That isn't change.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.891
That's just crazy.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:06.353
Wait one minute.

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:07.439
You said "Sturgeon

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.522
cares about us".

01:16:08.523 --> 01:16:09.607
You're not a student

01:16:09.608 --> 01:16:10.690
of this school...

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:12.130
or are you?

01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:13.568
Pff!

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.258
Whoa, easy, easy there, Hartley.

01:16:15.259 --> 01:16:16.946
No need to pick on a lady.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.658
Or is she a lady? Hm?

01:16:18.659 --> 01:16:20.367
How dare you say

01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:21.849
such a thing? I ought to take

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:23.328
you outside right now...

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.413
Get out now!

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:26.832
I'm defending you, dear.

01:16:31.713 --> 01:16:32.754
Oh, please!

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.361
This is obviously a ruse to end

01:16:34.362 --> 01:16:35.965
this meeting and save Sturgeon!

01:16:37.094 --> 01:16:38.218
Show's what you know.

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:39.762
He didn't know about any

01:16:39.763 --> 01:16:41.304
of this. He has no control

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:42.577
over any of us.

01:16:42.578 --> 01:16:43.848
Not helping, Bruno,

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.393
- but you can
- explain later. Uh...

01:16:45.396 --> 01:16:46.561
If everybody could just

01:16:46.562 --> 01:16:47.727
please follow me, quickly.

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:49.063
Quickly, quickly.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.400
Again, nice trick, Sturgeon,

01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:54.548
but I'm not

01:16:54.549 --> 01:16:55.693
falling for it.

01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:03.911
Where's Jane Snow?

01:17:03.912 --> 01:17:05.620
How can she just disappear?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.457
- Alright, come on,
- keep moving.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.882
- There's two more
- board members gone.

01:17:16.885 --> 01:17:18.196
Not to worry,

01:17:18.197 --> 01:17:19.509
I'm still here.

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:24.473
Hartley!

01:17:24.474 --> 01:17:26.601
This way, let's go, let's go!

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.230
Okay, I know a shortcut.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:32.688
I had that sealed off last week.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:34.484
- Yeah, I know you think
- you did, but...

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.238
Other way.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.827
Hold this. Hold this.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:49.664
Hey! Are those my biscuits?

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:50.917
That's not working!

01:17:50.918 --> 01:17:52.167
They're too light and fluffy!

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.587
- They're an award-winning
- recipe, of course they're light

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:56.422
- And fluffy!
- We need something more

01:17:56.425 --> 01:17:57.714
Than baked goods to save us!

01:18:02.052 --> 01:18:03.637
It worked!

01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:05.221
Elmer?

01:18:06.454 --> 01:18:07.683
Everybody duck!

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:10.186
Whoa!

01:18:10.187 --> 01:18:11.603
Chew on that!

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:14.439
It worked! It worked!

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.754
All it needed was

01:18:15.755 --> 01:18:17.066
a little more awesome,

01:18:17.067 --> 01:18:18.319
and also a couple extra screws

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.569
in the backpack, but still,

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:20.801
the Viscositizer's a win!

01:18:20.802 --> 01:18:22.030
Nice job!

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.325
- Okay, we need to find
- the rest of the board members.

01:18:24.328 --> 01:18:27.452
Ladies, if you can hear me:

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.162
for the Hall's honor!

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:37.629
Yes!

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:42.718
Yeah!

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:57.316
This is all...

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.425
As soon as we have our prince,

01:19:01.426 --> 01:19:03.488
you all will go.

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:04.780
But until then...

01:19:31.559 --> 01:19:34.018
Hi, everyone!

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.834
Don't worry, we're gonna get you

01:19:35.835 --> 01:19:37.647
out of here as soon as possible.

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:39.815
You're last.

01:19:50.579 --> 01:19:51.786
Team one, where are you?

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.539
Come in!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.167
Fire in the hole!

01:20:00.507 --> 01:20:03.965
Pando? Is that you?

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.719
Save our school!

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.846
William,

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:09.971
what is going on?

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.349
Why am I getting texts

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:12.724
from my girls about ninjas?

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:13.788
Do you hear

01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:14.850
what they're chanting?

01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:16.645
Save our school.

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.438
Your girls

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.607
and my boys.

01:20:20.608 --> 01:20:22.110
Speaking of boys, all I have

01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:23.610
to do now is get Francisco back.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:24.987
Sorry, who?

01:20:24.988 --> 01:20:26.362
Uh, never mind.

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.614
It doesn't matter.

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:28.864
It's not important.

01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:30.409
Boots, man, you did it! Well,

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:31.951
I mean, we did it. But you...

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.516
Bruno! Where's the prince?

01:20:33.517 --> 01:20:35.079
I thought you had him.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.582
I did, and... well,

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:38.082
then I didn't, so...

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.210
Wait, wait.

01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:40.335
What prince?

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.045
Bruno! Boots!

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.882
That was so much fun!

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:47.989
That prince.

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:49.093
He's with one of them!

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:50.512
Save our prince!

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:51.929
No, no, no, no, no!

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:53.145
It's alright! This is Pando,

01:20:53.146 --> 01:20:55.546
- head of the Royal Commandos.
- Wait, the Royal Commandos?

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:59.710
- Could somebody
- please tell me what is

01:20:59.711 --> 01:21:00.772
going on here, exactly?

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:04.818
I would appreciate this, too.

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.861
And you would be...

01:21:08.406 --> 01:21:09.947
It is I, King Balthazar Diaz

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.512
of the Royal Republic

01:21:11.513 --> 01:21:13.075
of Malbonia.

01:21:13.076 --> 01:21:15.453
Malbonia.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.707
Malbonia.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:20.543
But why would you

01:21:20.544 --> 01:21:21.710
want to come here,

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:23.734
to this place of commoners?

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:25.755
No offense intended.

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.216
Because, Father, ever since

01:21:27.217 --> 01:21:28.675
I became video pals with

01:21:28.676 --> 01:21:30.073
Bruno Walton, I saw how much fun

01:21:30.074 --> 01:21:31.469
you can have in a school!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.430
- Even a school
- that is not a castle

01:21:33.433 --> 01:21:34.598
And has no statues

01:21:34.599 --> 01:21:35.765
of myself inside.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:36.934
It is true,

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:38.100
I am quite fun.

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:40.436
But that is ridiculous!

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:41.918
School is not for fun.

01:21:41.919 --> 01:21:43.398
School is for important things,

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:45.130
like learning how to be a king.

01:21:45.131 --> 01:21:46.860
You understand this, yes?

01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:48.091
Actually, Your Highness,

01:21:48.092 --> 01:21:49.320
I happen to believe that when

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:50.531
you let children guide their

01:21:50.532 --> 01:21:51.740
own learning experience,

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:53.222
their sense of self

01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:54.701
engenders so...

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:55.870
I think what my well-meaning

01:21:55.871 --> 01:21:57.036
colleague is trying to say

01:21:57.037 --> 01:21:58.184
is that kids know

01:21:58.185 --> 01:21:59.330
what they need.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.875
I need a snack!

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.462
Believe it! Not only

01:22:04.463 --> 01:22:06.337
endangering the board

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:09.549
and the entire school, but me!

01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:12.176
Well, and you, of course.

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:13.992
While saving your hide,

01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:15.805
Hartley.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:19.016
While saving all of our hides.

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:20.581
Which the board has agreed

01:22:20.582 --> 01:22:22.144
is a pretty great example

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:24.168
of how well Headmaster Sturgeon

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:26.190
has prepared his students

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.485
- for life beyond Macdonald Hall.
- What?

01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:30.820
- Plus, any school
- that can make a prince travel

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.196
halfway around the world for fun

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.636
must be doing

01:22:33.637 --> 01:22:35.074
something right.

01:22:36.599 --> 01:22:38.119
I don't know what to say.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.580
Well, I do.

01:22:44.482 --> 01:22:45.585
Oh, God.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:47.337
Oh, God.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:50.673
You know, she is right.

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:52.384
Yes. Miss Snow is

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.093
tough, but fair.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:56.138
No, no. Your colleague, here.

01:22:56.139 --> 01:22:58.180
The beautiful.

01:22:58.181 --> 01:22:59.704
Eugenia Scrimmage.

01:22:59.705 --> 01:23:01.225
Currently single.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:02.227
Oh!

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:05.563
- I have ignored
- what my son wants

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:06.670
for too long,

01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:07.774
and I will fix this.

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:10.025
And I will fix the school

01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:11.341
for the damage that my Royal

01:23:11.342 --> 01:23:12.654
Commandos have done to it!

01:23:13.886 --> 01:23:15.114
Well, one down, at least.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.032
I'm sorry?

01:23:17.033 --> 01:23:18.890
Sorry. What my friend means is

01:23:18.891 --> 01:23:20.745
that Miss Scrimmage's academy

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:21.872
was also damaged

01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:22.997
a few weeks ago, so...

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:24.625
We have to wait for that to be

01:23:24.626 --> 01:23:26.250
fixed, and... steam cleaned.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:27.815
Or, you can allow me to pay

01:23:27.816 --> 01:23:29.378
for one brand new school!

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:31.380
That way, Mr. Sturgeon

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.487
and Miss Scrimmage

01:23:32.488 --> 01:23:33.591
can teach together forever!

01:23:34.615 --> 01:23:35.635
No!

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.930
- No, I mean, I think,
- you know, when it's possible...

01:23:37.933 --> 01:23:39.119
There is such a thing as

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.306
too much change.

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:42.101
Well! I can just pay for

01:23:42.102 --> 01:23:43.893
both schools to be fixed!

01:23:43.894 --> 01:23:46.604
Rush job! Around the clock!

01:23:46.605 --> 01:23:48.086
Would you say one week

01:23:48.087 --> 01:23:49.565
is too long to wait?

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.360
- Oh, thank you, that would
- really help us

01:23:51.363 --> 01:23:52.736
- Let things
- get back to normal.

01:23:57.992 --> 01:23:59.535
Wow. I suppose this means you

01:23:59.536 --> 01:24:01.077

you decide to room with,

you were right, you know?

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.512
Maybe we can do

awesome things separately.
