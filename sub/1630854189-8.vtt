WEBVTT

00:02.152 --> 00:04.228
Okay, y'all,
Randi asked me to make

00:04.246 --> 00:06.563
a Thanksgiving-themed smoothie.

00:06.582 --> 00:08.565
I was thinking
something with pumpkin spice.

00:08.658 --> 00:11.343
It costs the same,
but we get to charge 12 bucks.

00:11.495 --> 00:13.904
Ooh, I am so thankful
for bougie fools.

00:13.997 --> 00:16.907
And the reason
I didn't use pumpkin spice is

00:16.925 --> 00:20.410
that I don't wear yoga pants
and I'm not a basic bitch.

00:20.504 --> 00:22.170
(laughs)

00:22.264 --> 00:24.172
Ooh. Aw, hell no.

00:24.266 --> 00:27.100
That goes down like something
that already came back up.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.603
It's Mama's
green bean casserole.

00:29.755 --> 00:32.197
It's got cream
of mushroom soup and almonds.

00:32.349 --> 00:35.275
Dang, I forgot the fried onions.

00:35.427 --> 00:38.078
-Let me try it
with a little vodka.
-Mm.

00:40.599 --> 00:42.041
Much better.

00:42.268 --> 00:43.525
Hi, everybody.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.435
What the hell
are you two wearing?

00:45.529 --> 00:48.380
Oh, just a little matching
Thanksgiving hilarity.

00:48.457 --> 00:51.441
-"She's my sweet potato."
-"I yam."

00:52.127 --> 00:54.536
Okay, this is whiter
than the first Thanksgiving.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.056
So, what are you all doing
for Turkey Day?

00:57.207 --> 01:00.450
Same thing I always do,
feed the desperate and needy.

01:00.469 --> 01:03.287
But hopefully Katharine has
other plans this year.

01:03.305 --> 01:05.138
(laughs):
She's kidding.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.973
She's never invited me
for Thanksgiving.

01:07.126 --> 01:09.234
Well, CJ is spending it
with his mom,

01:09.461 --> 01:11.719
so Randi's gonna cook for me
all day.

01:11.797 --> 01:13.922
(scoffs) Randi better be
the name of your DoorDasher.

01:13.982 --> 01:17.076
I'm camping out all day to get
a good spot on Black Friday.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.912
-You getting a new TV?
-Nah, I'm not buying anything.

01:20.063 --> 01:21.972
Just there for the fights.

01:22.065 --> 01:23.248
How about you, Phil?

01:23.400 --> 01:25.475
Are you taking Jalen home
to meet your family?

01:25.494 --> 01:28.662
Oh, no, no, no. We just
started seeing each other.

01:28.814 --> 01:31.256
Plus, the Crumpler family
Thanksgiving can get

01:31.483 --> 01:32.666
a little rowdy.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.987
Last year's pig wrestle sent
two cousins to the ER.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.006
Well,
since everyone's available,

01:40.101 --> 01:41.583
we should do a Friendsgiving.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.935
(overlapping agreements)

01:43.086 --> 01:45.270
-I'm happy to host.
-(others groan)

01:45.422 --> 01:47.106
What?

01:47.182 --> 01:48.999
Kat-- how can I say this?

01:49.017 --> 01:50.442
Your parties suck.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.444
And that's nicer than
the way I was gonna put it.

01:52.596 --> 01:56.173
My parties are fun.
Max, back me up here.

01:56.266 --> 01:58.600
Ain't no party
like a Kat Silver party

01:58.677 --> 02:02.788
'cause a Kat Silver party's
got nonalcoholic punch.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.514
We were scrapbooking.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.366
You can't have
a bunch of drunk people

02:06.518 --> 02:08.535
wielding scissors
all willy-nilly.

02:08.687 --> 02:12.780
-This party's
gonna be different.
-Are you sure?

02:12.800 --> 02:13.707
I yam!

02:13.801 --> 02:16.026
-(others groaning)
-Up top? No?

02:16.119 --> 02:17.469
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

02:17.638 --> 02:19.888
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

02:20.957 --> 02:22.624
Why isn't Katharine
letting us in?

02:22.792 --> 02:25.218
Maybe the cats finally got her.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.812
I need to eat soon.

02:26.963 --> 02:29.297
-Phil is starting to look
like a cartoon drumstick.
-Ha!

02:29.391 --> 02:32.392
A drumstick wishes
it was this juicy.

02:32.544 --> 02:34.211
Carter has
a Thanksgiving protocol.

02:34.304 --> 02:35.970
He doesn't eat for 48 hours,

02:35.990 --> 02:39.049
-and then he shows up
in maternity pants.
-That's right.

02:39.067 --> 02:42.494
Tonight, I'm getting
knocked up with a food baby.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.146
Do we have any idea
what Kat has planned?

02:45.166 --> 02:46.981
Last night, she was
writing things on index cards

02:47.075 --> 02:51.670
and giggling, so I'm thinking
Thanksgiving Mad Libs.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.246
(all groaning)

02:53.399 --> 02:54.506
Kat's parties are so adjective,

02:54.733 --> 02:58.235
I'm gonna go verb myself
with a loaded noun.

02:58.237 --> 02:59.569
Good evening, everyone.

02:59.738 --> 03:01.513
I hope you're ready
for a night of glamorous fun.

03:01.740 --> 03:05.184
It's gonna be hotsy-totsy,
and that's no applesauce.

03:05.335 --> 03:07.260
You've got to be
adverb kidding me.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.429
Why are you dressed like that?

03:09.581 --> 03:12.557
You'll learn.
I stopped asking years ago.

03:12.710 --> 03:14.100
Why, I'm Kitty Vanderhuff,

03:14.195 --> 03:17.087
America's wealthiest
cat food tycoon.

03:17.105 --> 03:19.105
Our kibble is the cat's pajamas.

03:19.274 --> 03:21.849
We also make cat's pajamas.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.928
Now, if all you chippies
and cake-eaters are ready

03:24.947 --> 03:25.946
for a real humdinger,

03:26.098 --> 03:28.523
let's fly on up
to the cuckoo's nest.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.859
-Let's go upstairs.
-You hear that, baby?

03:32.028 --> 03:33.587
Mama's gonna eat.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.198
(jazz music playing)

03:37.218 --> 03:39.292
-Ooh!
-Oh, man.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.128
We're going back to the 1920s.
I love it.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.889
Although that means
us confirmed bachelors

03:44.116 --> 03:45.282
can't kiss in public.

03:45.342 --> 03:48.952
Oh, who cares,
there's cocaine in the soda pop.

03:49.045 --> 03:50.395
1920s? Hold up.

03:50.622 --> 03:52.138
If Randi and I got to eat
in the kitchen,

03:52.233 --> 03:53.790
-I'm calling Al Sharpton.
-(Kat laughs)

03:53.883 --> 03:56.884
No, all are welcome
at Kitty Vanderhuff's table.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.071
And to prove
that I throw fun parties,

03:59.298 --> 04:00.906
I've come up with a theme
for this evening,

04:01.057 --> 04:05.077
and the theme is...
(gasps) murder.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.578
(dramatic sting plays)

04:06.805 --> 04:10.732
Wow, honey,
a murder mystery Thanksgiving.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.808
Yay.

04:11.827 --> 04:14.402
All right,
let's meet the victim.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.738
If you please.
Earlier today,

04:16.757 --> 04:18.590
Tom Turkey was found
decapitated,

04:18.742 --> 04:20.408
plucked, and stuffed,

04:20.427 --> 04:23.077
and one of you
in this very room is...

04:23.097 --> 04:24.579
the murderer.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.156
(dramatic sting plays)

04:26.249 --> 04:28.008
You sure it didn't
die of boredom

04:28.084 --> 04:29.726
from one of your parties?

04:31.013 --> 04:32.938
We're not eating for a while,
are we?

04:33.089 --> 04:34.472
KAT:
Not true.

04:34.699 --> 04:37.851
Alexa, how long does it take
to cook a 20-pound turkey?

04:38.837 --> 04:41.171
<i> ALEXA:</i>
<i> It is recommended to cook</i>
<i> a 20-pound turkey</i>

04:41.264 --> 04:45.191
<i> for four hours and 15 minutes</i>
<i> at 325 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

04:45.286 --> 04:47.435
Four hours and 15 minutes?!

04:47.454 --> 04:51.999
Alexa, how long before
a human starves to death?

04:53.368 --> 04:56.536
<i> ALEXA:</i>
<i> Approximately 21 days.</i>

04:56.688 --> 04:58.021
This is horrible.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.115
Till we eat, I'm just a man
in maternity pants.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.135
Now, inside of these bags,

05:03.244 --> 05:05.028
you'll find
your character backstory,

05:05.047 --> 05:07.881
props and an alibi for...

05:07.975 --> 05:09.549
the murder.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.793
(dramatic sting plays)

05:11.812 --> 05:13.703
Give me that, or there's
gonna be another murder.

05:13.797 --> 05:17.374
No big deal,
because I have...

05:17.467 --> 05:21.711
-a backup.
-(dramatic sting plays)

05:21.730 --> 05:23.897
Who knew I'd miss Mad Libs?

05:24.733 --> 05:26.658
All right, Randi,
tell 'em who you are.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.401
Okay, uh, well, it says here

05:28.554 --> 05:30.387
-that I am-- Oh.
-She's my daughter!
She's my daughter.

05:30.405 --> 05:31.854
We've always best friends,

05:31.856 --> 05:34.391
but since blooming into
womanhood, she's more interested

05:34.409 --> 05:36.835
in the attention
of gentleman callers.

05:36.986 --> 05:40.188
Yeah, you're right,
we should've gotten high.

05:40.248 --> 05:42.415
Cool, I'm Mayor McCheese.

05:42.568 --> 05:45.677
Oh, it's Mayor McChase.
Sorry. Typo.

05:45.829 --> 05:48.755
Don't be sorry, Mayor McCheese
commends Ms. Vanderhuff

05:48.849 --> 05:51.074
on this fine celebration.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.518
Shamrock Shakes for everyone!

05:54.188 --> 05:55.837
I'm a world-class jockey

05:55.856 --> 05:58.582
and three-time
Kentucky Derby Champion.

05:58.675 --> 06:01.509
I get it, I'm short.

06:02.345 --> 06:04.588
I was a preeminent surgeon
in the Army,

06:04.681 --> 06:08.182
who saw things during
the Great War that changed me.

06:08.276 --> 06:11.111
-And what else?
-I have a crush on Kitty.

06:11.263 --> 06:12.996
Darn tootin', you do.

06:14.190 --> 06:15.281
Max, who are you?

06:15.358 --> 06:16.766
Uh, a brilliant
college professor.

06:16.901 --> 06:20.528
I won the Nobel Prize
for my work in thermochemistry.

06:20.622 --> 06:22.622
Great, I'm the nerd.

06:23.609 --> 06:25.550
Really, Katharine?
I'm your maid?

06:25.702 --> 06:27.219
(chuckles) Tut-tut.

06:27.446 --> 06:28.945
I rescued you off the street

06:28.964 --> 06:31.765
when you got too old
to be a prostitute.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.302
This is the first costume
I've ever worn

06:36.397 --> 06:38.805
that my father would approve of.

06:38.957 --> 06:40.607
I'll be right back.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.551
He is such a delight.

06:43.645 --> 06:46.646
If he were straight
and 20 years younger,

06:46.798 --> 06:48.073
he'd be perfect for me.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.150
He's sweet, he's smart.

06:50.244 --> 06:53.470
He makes me feel like
I'm the only person in the room.

06:53.563 --> 06:56.973
Look at me, falling for him
at the speed of lesbian.

06:56.992 --> 06:58.308
(laughing)

06:58.310 --> 07:01.068
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

07:01.163 --> 07:04.147
Unlikely friends, secret allies,

07:04.166 --> 07:06.499
perhaps partners in... murder?

07:06.593 --> 07:08.168
(fart noise)

07:08.262 --> 07:10.336
Okay, who messed with my button?

07:10.505 --> 07:14.474
Hmm, looks like another mystery.

07:15.343 --> 07:17.269
This is the worst party ever,

07:17.496 --> 07:20.105
and I've been to an adult bris.

07:20.332 --> 07:21.514
You know what?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.758
You're a worse maid
than you were a prostitute,

07:23.777 --> 07:25.351
and you were
an awful prostitute.

07:25.504 --> 07:28.572
Al Capone called,
he wants his penny back.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.601
If you keep looking at your
phone, Kat's gonna kick you out.

07:33.695 --> 07:35.862
Actually, that's a good idea.
Give me that.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.349
(groans) I sent this record
label my demo over a week ago.

07:39.351 --> 07:41.609
I just really need
some good news.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.870
The phonograph is a fad,
it'll never catch on.

07:44.022 --> 07:46.873
Now, put away that cell blower,
or it's 23 skidoo for you.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.085
Well, I was looking at it, too,
if you want me to Scooby-Doo.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.287
This label is perfect for me.

07:53.381 --> 07:54.639
They only have a few artists.

07:54.866 --> 07:59.052
Although one of them is
Kenny Chesney... 's cousin.

07:59.871 --> 08:02.706
Max, can you just put that away
for a few hours

08:02.724 --> 08:04.708
and be part of this party?

08:04.726 --> 08:06.300
I can, I just don't want to.

08:06.394 --> 08:08.561
What is wrong with you people?!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.880
It's like you're not even
trying to have fun.

08:10.899 --> 08:13.399
You know, when I bought
these decorations at Party City,

08:13.494 --> 08:15.309
the cashier said,
"Wow, I'm so jealous.

08:15.403 --> 08:16.828
Y'all are gonna have
a good time."

08:17.055 --> 08:19.164
Well, you know what, Donna?
I'm the jealous one now.

08:19.315 --> 08:20.740
I wish it were me driving

08:20.834 --> 08:23.335
all the unsold Halloween crap
to the dump.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.671
I'm trying. I checked
every side dish for clues.

08:26.823 --> 08:31.092
The real mystery is
who stole all the flavor?

08:33.405 --> 08:37.590
All right, guys,
Kat worked really hard on this.

08:37.743 --> 08:39.667
So let's show her
how much we appreciate it

08:39.686 --> 08:40.910
by having some fun.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.020
Thank you.

08:42.247 --> 08:44.414
By making it a drinking game!

08:44.432 --> 08:45.582
(cheering)

08:45.600 --> 08:46.674
No. No, no.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.342
We don't need drinking
to make it fun.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.861
I mean, it's already
a logical deduction game.

08:50.013 --> 08:53.273
How about every time Katharine
bosses us around, we drink?

08:53.349 --> 08:55.200
No, no, we are not doing that.

08:55.277 --> 08:56.943
She bossed us. Drink!

08:57.095 --> 08:59.079
(cheering)

09:02.876 --> 09:05.043
-(jazz music playing)
-No snacking.

09:05.194 --> 09:06.545
Here you go.
Since it's Prohibition,

09:06.772 --> 09:09.289
I had to get the booze from
a couple of shady bootleggers.

09:09.457 --> 09:11.716
They tried to give me
the "rum-around."

09:11.943 --> 09:14.210
Dear God,
only you could ruin alcohol.

09:15.038 --> 09:16.871
So, how do we wrap this game up?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.616
Oh, we've hardly scratched
the surface of the fun.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.284
First you gather clues,

09:21.377 --> 09:23.210
then after many hours
of sifting through evidence,

09:23.230 --> 09:24.470
you make an accusation.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.973
It was Carter. Game over.
Let's frigging eat.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.766
Excuse me? I didn't do it.

09:28.993 --> 09:33.129
And I'm the mayor, so you may
refer to me as "Your Highness."

09:33.148 --> 09:36.057
Okay, new rule, anyone
who makes a wrong accusation

09:36.151 --> 09:37.467
has to drink.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.136
I accuse the groundskeeper.

09:40.229 --> 09:41.729
There is no groundskeeper.

09:41.823 --> 09:42.730
Oh, I know.

09:43.475 --> 09:45.491
-It was the maid.
-(others gasp)

09:45.660 --> 09:47.327
Tom Turkey knew
she was spit shining

09:47.479 --> 09:49.254
more than the jockey's shoes.

09:49.481 --> 09:52.315
(gasps) You treacherous bitch.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.575
Seriously, me and the maid?

09:54.669 --> 09:58.488
I don't mind being straight,
but really, the help?

09:58.506 --> 10:00.673
I'll tell you
who I think it was--

10:00.767 --> 10:02.601
our host, Fancy Puffenstuff.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.102
-(others gasps)
-Oh, it's true.

10:04.329 --> 10:05.711
Look at those ham hands.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.106
She could strangle a buffalo.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.758
Why, I would never
hurt Tom Turkey.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.927
He was my...
Randi, get the button ready.

10:13.096 --> 10:14.929
Nope.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.115
Fine. He was my...

10:17.266 --> 10:20.118
-father. "Dun, dun..."
-(fart noise)

10:20.195 --> 10:21.511
All right. Who has the button?

10:21.604 --> 10:25.624
Yeah, it was definitely
the button.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.462
You don't know
what it's like to be mayor.

10:30.613 --> 10:32.613
All those citizens,

10:32.633 --> 10:33.965
all those potholes,

10:34.117 --> 10:37.543
having to carry around
that big-ass key to the city.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.787
Well, you don't know what
it's like being Kat's daughter.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.032
I know it's pretend,
but the embarrassment is real.

10:43.201 --> 10:45.310
(ice rattling)

10:45.461 --> 10:47.553
So, Professor,
as a colleague of Edison's,

10:47.648 --> 10:49.814
I'm curious what you think
of Nikola Tesla.

10:49.966 --> 10:51.298
Oh, that dude's awesome.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.319
Great cars,
even better cough drops.

10:54.546 --> 10:57.489
♪<i> Ni-ko-la!</i> ♪

10:59.885 --> 11:01.217
(laughing)

11:01.310 --> 11:02.643
This is the best Thanksgiving

11:02.663 --> 11:05.497
since Katharine's father and I
went to Honolulu.

11:05.648 --> 11:10.226
We swam with the dolphins
and had sex on the USS<i> Arizona.</i>

11:10.319 --> 11:13.913
I've never been, but I sure
watched a lot of<i> Magnum, P.I.</i>

11:14.065 --> 11:17.384
The mystery was, "Am I gay?"
And he solved it.

11:18.494 --> 11:20.920
Oh, Hawaii with you
would be magical.

11:21.072 --> 11:24.665
We could boink
at all the war memorials.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.093
KAT:
Hey, y'all, come on in.

11:27.245 --> 11:28.836
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:28.855 --> 11:31.414
dames and daddies,
get your wiggle on.

11:31.433 --> 11:34.175
The moment has arrived.
Dinner is... Whoa.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.527
-Oh.
-(others gasp)

11:36.421 --> 11:38.588
(high-pitched):
Ah! My baby!

11:38.606 --> 11:40.573
Screw it! I'm going in!

11:42.536 --> 11:44.369
-(overlapping chatter)
-Save some for me.

11:44.596 --> 11:46.538
I'm the runt of the litter.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.264
(overlapping chatter)

11:48.357 --> 11:49.766
MAX:
Phil! That is my foot!

11:50.526 --> 11:53.336
This is the best Thanksgiving
ever!

11:59.869 --> 12:02.203
That was the worst Thanksgiving
ever.

12:02.297 --> 12:05.206
Oh, good, hey, you're up.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.966
Who wants a breakfast margarita?

12:07.135 --> 12:09.043
How are you not hungover?

12:09.212 --> 12:12.121
You can't get hungover
if you don't stop drinking.

12:12.215 --> 12:13.881
-(whirring)
-(others groan)

12:14.050 --> 12:16.234
Dude! It is Black Friday.

12:16.311 --> 12:18.795
I will whoop your ass
at a discount.

12:19.481 --> 12:22.315
Well, you know what they say,
it's noon somewhere.

12:22.467 --> 12:23.633
I'll take one.

12:23.726 --> 12:26.302
That's a hell of a mattress
you got in there.

12:26.321 --> 12:27.804
Is that where you slept, baby?

12:27.897 --> 12:29.581
Yeah.

12:29.808 --> 12:30.990
(laughs)

12:31.142 --> 12:32.658
Where's Jalen?

12:32.811 --> 12:35.328
Well, he left after you told him
you loved him.

12:35.497 --> 12:36.646
What?!

12:36.664 --> 12:38.405
I was as surprised as he was.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.759
How about you make me
one for a grown-up?

12:42.245 --> 12:44.320
I told him I loved him?

12:44.413 --> 12:45.597
What did he say?

12:45.824 --> 12:50.343
He said, "You're pretty drunk,
please stop crying."

12:50.495 --> 12:51.677
Oh.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.830
-(buzzes)
-Oh, my God.

12:53.923 --> 12:55.498
The record label loved my demo

12:55.591 --> 12:58.501
and would like to meet me
in Nashville tomorrow.

12:58.594 --> 13:00.186
Whoa, that's amazing!

13:00.263 --> 13:02.280
You're gonna meet Biff Chesney.

13:02.431 --> 13:03.931
(cheering)

13:04.025 --> 13:06.692
Okay, okay,
everybody be happy quieter.

13:06.845 --> 13:09.512
This is a perfect end
to what many are calling

13:09.605 --> 13:12.606
a flawless
murder mystery Thanksgiving.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.868
Well, you know, we never found
out who murdered Tom Turkey.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.854
Oh, we all did,

13:17.872 --> 13:20.039
with our apathy
toward factory farming.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.782
-(booing)
-God.

13:21.876 --> 13:23.134
That's stupid.

13:23.361 --> 13:26.471
All my parties end
with a teachable moment.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.724
Excuse me,
I'm gonna go throw up.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.040
I need some relationship advice.

13:37.058 --> 13:39.042
On it, what's up?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.210
Oh, I meant Randi, Carter.

13:41.229 --> 13:43.304
Any of these people.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.823
Phil, if you haven't
heard from Jalen,

13:44.974 --> 13:45.973
you need to text him.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.233
But what would I say?

13:47.385 --> 13:49.402
Is it time
to send a tasteful nude?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.704
-Fixes everything.
-No.
-Bad idea.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.074
-KAT: Oh, hey.
-Hey.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.334
Hey, Phil, can I get a coffee?

13:56.485 --> 13:58.227
I didn't expect you
back so early.

13:58.396 --> 13:59.245
How was your meeting?

13:59.397 --> 14:01.322
I decided to skip the meeting.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.732
You skipped it?

14:02.750 --> 14:04.233
Yeah, the label's
too small for me.

14:04.327 --> 14:06.085
I-I need a place
with a bigger reach.

14:06.254 --> 14:09.238
Well, big things come
from small things all the time.

14:09.332 --> 14:12.909
If you need proof, I can send
you one of my tasteful nudes.

14:13.078 --> 14:15.353
Uh, I'm sorry,
I'm just confused.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.246
Yesterday you were
so excited about this.

14:17.265 --> 14:18.764
And today I changed my mind.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.100
-But I don't...
-Just let it go.

14:21.252 --> 14:23.269
Wait-- Max, hang on.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.512
-What's Max's problem?
-Oh, who cares?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.774
Now, should I send
this text to Jalen?

14:28.927 --> 14:31.777
"Hey, just checking in.
How's it going?

14:31.930 --> 14:35.540
"Are you breaking up with me?
Please don't. I love you.

14:35.691 --> 14:36.690
This is Phil."

14:36.784 --> 14:39.043
-Perfect. Send it.
-No!

14:40.046 --> 14:41.862
My phone.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.548
What's going on?

14:43.699 --> 14:47.293
The truth is I overslept.
My stupid alarm didn't go off.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.220
Oh, well, you can always ask me.

14:49.372 --> 14:50.446
I'll be your wakeup call.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.115
I can even do one of my accents.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.633
(in accent): Crikey, mate,
it's time to get up.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.376
You've got things to didgeridoo.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.228
I'm not in the mood, Kat.
It's not a great day.

14:57.455 --> 14:59.305
Okay. Well, just reschedule.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.882
I tried.
They were jerks about it.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.192
Really?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.052
You know what?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.796
It's their loss.

15:06.814 --> 15:08.615
You're gonna find
some place better.

15:09.484 --> 15:11.159
Thanks.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.894
Have you been drinking?

15:13.914 --> 15:17.165
I stopped off at a bar, had
a couple to take the edge off.

15:17.992 --> 15:19.417
Uh, it's not even 3:00.

15:19.568 --> 15:22.236
I mean, who are you,
one of the Real Housewives?

15:22.330 --> 15:24.071
What are you saying,
I drink too much?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.573
Um, you tell me.

15:26.668 --> 15:29.594
Were you drunk last night
and that's why you overslept?

15:29.821 --> 15:31.095
Kat, will you give me a break?

15:31.247 --> 15:33.172
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on here.

15:33.324 --> 15:34.824
I said that
my alarm didn't go off!

15:34.993 --> 15:36.100
I didn't realize
that you were monitoring

15:36.252 --> 15:37.751
how much I was drinking.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.178
And who didn't
have to get hammered

15:39.255 --> 15:40.921
to get through
your dumbass party?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.441
Max...

15:44.277 --> 15:46.335
Okay, he's way out of line.

15:46.354 --> 15:48.429
That party was on the chain.

15:48.523 --> 15:50.931
Or off the chain.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.160
Whichever one is cool,
my party was that.

15:56.698 --> 15:59.273
Kat, everyone drinks too much
at the holidays.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.517
That's what
family does to people.

16:01.610 --> 16:04.278
I know,
but this feels different to me.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.113
Max was so excited
about this meeting,

16:06.132 --> 16:08.541
and then he missed it
because he drank too much.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.802
I mean, you're his roommate,
have you noticed anything?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.120
Well,
only when it's Tequila Tuesday.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.531
Or Whiskey Wednesday.
Or Thirsty Thursday.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.550
Wait, damn,
do I have a drinking problem?

16:17.644 --> 16:20.294
Max doesn't have
a problem with drinking.

16:20.388 --> 16:22.205
He has a problem paying his tab.

16:22.207 --> 16:25.466
I mean, once he settles up,
my kid can finally get braces.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.193
(knocking)

16:28.062 --> 16:29.487
Oh, no, it's Jalen.

16:29.714 --> 16:31.739
(dramatic sting plays)

16:32.975 --> 16:34.975
It's the best three bucks
I've ever spent.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.070
Oh, God. He's here
to break up with me.

16:38.223 --> 16:40.056
He's gonna do it in person.

16:40.074 --> 16:41.907
That is so classy,

16:42.060 --> 16:43.409
I love him even more.

16:43.561 --> 16:44.910
-Well, be strong.
-Be confident.

16:45.063 --> 16:47.362
Cry early and often.

16:48.157 --> 16:50.566
Hey, you.
See you later, guys.

16:50.659 --> 16:52.343
I love you, Kat.
I love you, Randi.

16:52.495 --> 16:53.794
I love you, Carter.

16:53.905 --> 16:57.256
Something I say to everyone,
doesn't mean anything.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.059
It meant something to somebody.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.079
Don't know if you got my text.

17:03.097 --> 17:05.748
It was nothing special, just,

17:05.767 --> 17:07.767
"What's up?" (chuckles)

17:07.861 --> 17:10.445
Not "wassup..."

17:11.698 --> 17:13.105
You remember that
20 years ago?

17:13.258 --> 17:14.940
Oh, boy, that was funny.

17:15.093 --> 17:17.093
Anyway, nice talk. Kiss?

17:17.853 --> 17:21.597
I-I did get your text,
and sorry I didn't respond.

17:21.616 --> 17:24.934
But what I have to say
should be said in person.

17:25.027 --> 17:26.360
No.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.546
You cannot break up with me
if you can't catch me.

17:28.773 --> 17:30.465
N-No, no. Oh, Phil.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.292
Sit down, Phil.

17:33.369 --> 17:35.444
I'm not breaking up with you.

17:35.463 --> 17:36.629
Oh, thank God.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.932
I haven't run in over 40 years.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.286
Look, I'm not gonna lie,

17:43.379 --> 17:45.730
when you said you loved me,
it kind of freaked me out.

17:45.957 --> 17:47.231
So...

17:47.383 --> 17:51.460
I spent the last couple days
thinking about...

17:51.479 --> 17:52.570
why.

17:52.797 --> 17:54.313
Well, I know why I said it.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.408
You're kind, you're thoughtful.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.245
You've got a butt
tight as airport security.

18:02.398 --> 18:05.899
Since we met,
it's been super obvious to me

18:05.993 --> 18:08.311
that I'm falling for you.

18:08.404 --> 18:09.829
Oh.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.648
Then you went and said that
and I...

18:12.667 --> 18:15.334
I don't want to ruin this
by rushing it.

18:15.486 --> 18:17.820
Well, I don't want to ruin it,
either.

18:17.989 --> 18:19.806
I want to make sure
we do this right.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.658
You're the first boyfriend
I've ever had

18:22.677 --> 18:25.061
where I really see a future.

18:25.663 --> 18:26.846
Boyfriend?

18:27.165 --> 18:29.498
I ate turkey off the floor
with you and your weird friends.

18:29.592 --> 18:32.568
You think I'd do that for
anyone less than a boyfriend?

18:33.838 --> 18:36.114
(music playing faintly)

18:41.121 --> 18:43.863
Hmm. I got a boyfriend.

18:44.015 --> 18:45.848
(giggling)

18:45.867 --> 18:48.717
And my friends are cool.

18:48.719 --> 18:50.369
The only weird one is Kat.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.130
Ay, ay, ay.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.132
Y'all want to come up
for some Thanksgiving leftovers?

18:54.283 --> 18:56.375
I'm in.
How about you, food baby?

18:56.527 --> 18:59.545
(scoffs) Back up, ladies,
he is all mine.

18:59.697 --> 19:00.954
(phone rings)

19:01.048 --> 19:02.047
Oh.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.199
Hey, Max.

19:03.292 --> 19:04.291
Yeah, I'm glad you called.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.435
Uh, listen, about earlier...

19:07.463 --> 19:08.371
What?

19:08.464 --> 19:09.555
What's going on?

19:09.707 --> 19:11.540
He got arrested
for public intoxication.

19:11.709 --> 19:14.043
(dramatic sting plays)

19:14.061 --> 19:15.378
Seriously?

19:15.396 --> 19:18.489
Oh, so now
you don't like the button?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.407
All right, I'm-a just
come out and say it.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.002
I think peeing on a cop car
is funny.

19:31.229 --> 19:33.913
You, sir, are an ally.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.748
Why did you bring them?

19:35.900 --> 19:37.416
Do you know how exciting it is

19:37.543 --> 19:39.343
for a Black person
to bail out a white dude?

19:39.570 --> 19:41.995
I mean, this is the world
that Dr. King dreamed of.

19:42.089 --> 19:45.591
I'm here because
my boyfriend is a lawyer.

19:45.793 --> 19:48.019
Did you say boyfriend, Phil?

19:48.095 --> 19:49.520
(singsongy):
Why, yes, I did.

19:49.672 --> 19:53.082
Max, maybe you want to walk us
through what happened?

19:54.101 --> 19:56.176
Uh, after our fight,
I had a couple of drinks,

19:56.196 --> 19:58.921
and then I was walking home,

19:59.014 --> 20:00.439
because I didn't
want to drive drunk,

20:00.591 --> 20:02.700
which I think
I deserve credit for.

20:02.927 --> 20:04.202
No.

20:04.946 --> 20:07.705
So, I ducked into a side street
to go.

20:07.856 --> 20:09.932
And you went on a police car.

20:09.951 --> 20:13.085
Near a police car.
The wind did the rest.

20:15.197 --> 20:16.363
All right, maybe...

20:16.382 --> 20:18.274
maybe I have been drinking
more than usual.

20:18.292 --> 20:21.627
Yeah, the neighborhood kid who
recycles our cans and bottles

20:21.796 --> 20:23.870
just bought a new bike.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.465
It's just the music stuff hasn't
been going like I wanted,

20:26.559 --> 20:29.118
and I just have
too much free time lately.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.213
My boyfriend says, "Idle hands
are the devil's playground."

20:33.233 --> 20:36.976
That's right,
I have a boyfriend.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.720
Maybe a break would be good.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.055
You know, change up my habits.

20:42.224 --> 20:43.724
I think that's smart.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.909
You know what might help?

20:45.060 --> 20:46.768
Paying your bar tab.

20:47.488 --> 20:49.896
I'm sorry that I snapped at you.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.974
Oh. It's okay.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.251
I figured it was
the alcohol talking.

20:53.327 --> 20:56.069
Why else would you say
I threw a dumbass party?

20:56.163 --> 20:57.980
Oh, good God, give it a rest.

20:58.073 --> 20:59.665
We didn't eat for six hours.

20:59.817 --> 21:02.093
Jalen thinks you're weird.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.595
