01:05.230 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:24.751 --> 01:27.549
Mmm, good pancakes,
Mom.

01:27.654 --> 01:31.146
Well, thank you, honey.
They come in a squeeze bottle now.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.248
Whoo!

01:33.359 --> 01:37.159
I better put on the silencer.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.596
You know what would be good with these?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.531
Is some Ms. Butterworth.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.830
Let's have a breakfast meeting.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.374
Ew. How long has this
baking soda been in here?

01:48.475 --> 01:50.375
I don't know.
It came with the house.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.844
Hey, Dad. I bet you five bucks
you can't eat the whole box.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.745
Five.
Why don't we make it 50?

01:56.850 --> 01:59.080
Oh-ho.
You're gonna regret this.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.711
I'll call Poison Control.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.290
Fran, it's me.
Just a heads-up.

02:06.559 --> 02:08.618
Wow.

02:08.728 --> 02:13.290
The absorbed odors
of a million meals.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.924
Oh, so many flavors!

02:16.035 --> 02:18.333
All those tasty memories flooding back.

02:20.907 --> 02:23.569
<i>If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.</i>

02:25.678 --> 02:29.808
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency.</i>

02:29.916 --> 02:32.783
<i>Just one small step for man...</i>

02:32.886 --> 02:36.378
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

02:39.792 --> 02:42.556
Uh-oh. Dad's having
an antacid trip.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.426
And I won 50 bucks.

02:45.532 --> 02:49.434
Can I see the 50, Bart?
Can I? Huh?

02:49.536 --> 02:53.302
Milhouse, my friend, you and I
are going on a spending spree.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.466
My doctor says I'm not
supposed to go on sprees.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.976
- What about jags?
- Jags are fine.

02:59.078 --> 03:01.638
Wonderful.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.452
A $50 bill?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.482
Gentlemen, let us shop.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.492
Our wide variety of gum
comes in both stick and ball.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.654
I'm not really about gum.
But I like the whole chewing thing.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.096
- Are you averse to crispy centers, sir?
- Not at all.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.896
Then we have much to discuss.

03:23.002 --> 03:26.165
Too much raw bacon.

03:26.272 --> 03:29.070
Come on, Bart.
We can't stop spending now.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.042
There's one thing
I've always wanted to do.

03:32.145 --> 03:36.013
My mom doesn't believe
in fabric softener.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.447
But she's not around!

03:39.986 --> 03:41.886
I'm picking the next thing.

03:41.988 --> 03:44.513
Looks like we're down
to our last 10 bucks.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.785
Hello.

03:49.495 --> 03:52.464
Radioactive Man, number 1,000, please?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.795
Ten dollars?
I laugh at you.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.893
Please to note,
this is no ordinary comic book.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.938
It is in perma-mint condition.

04:00.039 --> 04:03.475
If you spill soda on it, the drops fly off
harmlessly onto lesser comics.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.908
Yes, you are quite correct to gasp.

04:06.012 --> 04:09.106
Also note the price, $25.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.683
We had to buy lunch
for that homeless guy.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.252
While my son's at fat camp,
I cleaned out his room.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.345
How much will you
give me for this?

04:16.456 --> 04:18.981
Probably nothing.
But let us see.

04:19.091 --> 04:23.324
Oh! Handwritten script for <i>Star Wars</i>
by George Lucas?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.624
Princess Leia's anti-jiggle breast tape.

04:25.732 --> 04:29.930
Film reel labeled, " Alternate Ending:
Luke's Father is Chewbacca"?

04:30.036 --> 04:33.437
Ooh! Ooh!
I'll give you five dollars for the box.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.030
Sold!

04:36.142 --> 04:38.372
Don't do it, lady!
That stuff s worth thousands!

04:38.478 --> 04:41.447
Yeah! He's ripping you off!

04:41.547 --> 04:47.417
Well, if this is valuable, then back
to the leaky basement it goes! Hmph!

04:47.520 --> 04:49.647
Smile, please.

04:49.756 --> 04:51.656
Thank you.

04:59.232 --> 05:03.999
Son, I know it hurts. I still remember
my first lifetime banning.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.208
Hey, where's my melon?

05:18.751 --> 05:22.187
And you are banned for life from all
of my performances and TV specials!

05:22.288 --> 05:25.780
But I can still see your movies, right?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.727
And I never saw Gallagher again.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.273
Oh, it says here that
special effects whiz Tom Savini...

05:41.374 --> 05:44.343
is gonna be appearing
at the comic book store tonight.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.275
- Tom Savini?
- Yes.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.246
It says here he's the movie
magician behind <i>Creepshow...</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:51.874
<i>Friday the 13th,</i>
and <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

05:51.984 --> 05:55.078
I can't believe I'm gonna miss that.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.656
Don't worry your spiky little head.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.123
I've got it all planned out.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.990
How could you have it planned out?
You just heard about the problem.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.190
You're right.
Give me a minute. Hmm.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.571
Mr. Simpson, it hurts!

06:12.672 --> 06:15.539
Yeah. And why did we have
to do this all the way from home?

06:15.641 --> 06:19.133
For once in my life, I'm tall.
Don't take that away from me.

06:19.245 --> 06:23.011
Hello. I'm Shaquille O'Neal.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.209
Let us in, please.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.651
You two are not welcome.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.487
- Sorry, Son.
- Thanks for the tip-off.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.493
No problem.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.655
Appearing exclusively here
at The Android's Dungeon-

06:38.765 --> 06:41.427
Take that, Messieurs
Barnes and Noble.

06:41.534 --> 06:44.731
The king of splatter, Tom Savini!

06:45.905 --> 06:47.964
Good evening.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.167
Sorry, I had a really big dinner.

06:50.276 --> 06:53.575
- Whoo! Dinner!
- But I'm sure one more french fry wouldn't hurt.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.682
Oh, we missed the gut buster!

07:04.791 --> 07:07.521
Yeah. That should be us
covered with blood.

07:07.627 --> 07:11.324
Sure, computer technology
is here to stay.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.162
But there'll always be a place
for the practical special effects wizard.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.900
Hey! All right!

07:20.006 --> 07:21.701
I love the theater.

07:21.808 --> 07:26.541
Oh, please. I saw Paul Lynde do
that same hackneyed trick on <i>Bewitched.</i>

07:27.847 --> 07:30.407
Try to explode this
out of my belly.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.383
That's not a cookie.

07:33.486 --> 07:37.047
That's a time-release blood pack.

07:37.156 --> 07:41.183
You, sir, are a perfect patsy.
Let me shake your hand.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.956
To the gag,
I will give a D-plus.

07:44.063 --> 07:49.000
As for the workmanship on the hand, it- Oh.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.433
That's not right!

07:52.438 --> 07:55.430
You mocking me!
Oh, that is rich.

07:59.245 --> 08:03.807
Stop your laughing!
You're all banned! Banned I tell you!

08:06.352 --> 08:08.320
Breath... short.

08:08.421 --> 08:11.117
Left arm... numb.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.854
Can't go on describing symptoms
much longer.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.396
I think he's had a heart attack.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.738
Young man, you've had what
we call a "cardiac episode."

08:30.843 --> 08:33.107
Worst episode ever.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.203
Oh, not even close.

08:35.313 --> 08:40.342
If these boys hadn't called 911,
I'd be wearing that watch right now.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.546
I'm just kidding.
But you would be dead.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.555
You saved my life?

08:44.657 --> 08:46.852
Yeah. After you were
so mean to us.

08:46.959 --> 08:49.826
- So now we're even.
- My prognosis-

08:49.929 --> 08:52.193
Or is it diagnosis? Whichever.

08:52.298 --> 08:56.132
You need to avoid stress.
Now what kind of work do you do?

08:56.235 --> 08:58.032
I run a comic book store.

08:58.137 --> 09:01.629
Oh, dear Lord!
We call that profession "the widow-maker!"

09:01.741 --> 09:04.335
Or we would if any of the proprietors
were married.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.707
You should close down
the store for a while.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.940
But I'd lose all my business
to Frodo's of Shelbyville!

09:10.049 --> 09:13.109
Well, then get a friend
to run it for you.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.744
You do have friends, don't you?

09:15.855 --> 09:17.823
Well, the Super Friends.

09:17.924 --> 09:20.119
Well, you should get some friends
who aren't printed on paper.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.989
What?
You mean action figures?

09:22.094 --> 09:26.497
- We'll run the store for ya!
- Two 10-year-olds running my store?

09:26.599 --> 09:30.091
I mean-Wait.
What is this? Bizarro World?

09:30.202 --> 09:33.899
Calm down!
Don't make me put a dog heart in there.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.843
Can you believe it, Bart?
We're actually running a comic book store.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.383
Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.

09:46.786 --> 09:48.151
Sorry! Sorry!

09:48.254 --> 09:51.223
Okay. Here's Comic Book Guy's
instructions.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.953
"A carton of malted milk balls,
one box confectioner's sugar...

09:55.061 --> 09:56.961
a can of chocolate frosting"-

09:57.063 --> 09:58.963
That's just his shopping list.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.896
No. It's his instructions.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.332
Well, we're gonna make
some changes around here.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.564
This store's gonna be run
by kids and for kids.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.140
You said it, partner.

10:12.244 --> 10:16.738
Ah, nice to see ya.
Hey, how about that Bloodzilla?

10:16.849 --> 10:20.876
<i>Vampire Dinosaur?</i>
Oh, you can't make that stuff up.

10:20.987 --> 10:25.185
"The Death of Sad Sack."
This better not be another fake out.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.988
Uh-uh. You gotta be 40 inches tall
for the adult section.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.120
Please?

10:31.230 --> 10:34.063
Okay. But get on your tippie toes.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.139
<i>Everybody's hugging!</i>

10:41.240 --> 10:44.437
Hey, Bart.
Lfinished organizing the stockroom.

10:44.543 --> 10:48.070
Mark down the Poochie crap.
Then unstick all the Supergirls.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.308
You know, if we're partners,
maybe you should do some of the work.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.875
- Less barking, more marking.
- Yes, sir, partner.

10:59.358 --> 11:02.088
Now, when you've got
a bum ticker like we do...

11:02.194 --> 11:04.128
you need all the friends you can get.

11:04.230 --> 11:08.633
And Moe's is the friendliest place
in the rum district.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.865
Get out and take
your Sacajawea dollars with ya.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.304
I'll give you till three. One-

11:17.309 --> 11:21.678
Hey, Homer, who's the manatee?

11:21.781 --> 11:24.614
Ah, now, be nice, Moe.
This guy just got outta the hospital.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.912
Ah, sorry.
Let me buy you a drink.

11:27.019 --> 11:30.750
Very well. I will have a shot
of cranberry schnapps.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.485
Uh, these, they're just painted on there.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.562
Your choices are beer
and, uh, egg soakings.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.962
I'll pass.
Beer is the nectar of the nitwit.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.035
Hey, you knockin' beer?

11:43.135 --> 11:45.103
Nobody bad-mouths Duff!

11:46.772 --> 11:48.535
Ah, a piece a crap.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.804
- Come on. You're here to make friends.
- Oh, please.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.278
If I wanted to hear mindless droning,
I'd befriend an air conditioner.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.508
Oh, now he's ragging
on air conditioners.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.846
Hey, they keep us cool
in the summer, pal.

11:59.952 --> 12:01.783
Get him!

12:01.887 --> 12:04.185
And stay out!

12:09.228 --> 12:11.719
Is there a word in Klingon
for "loneliness."

12:12.998 --> 12:16.161
Ah, yes. <i>Garl dack!</i>

12:16.268 --> 12:19.203
<i>Milhouse, I'm impressed.</i>

12:19.305 --> 12:23.139
The store is so busy. You and Bart
are really great businessmen.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.871
Well, I'm really the brains.
Bart's just the eye candy.

12:26.979 --> 12:30.415
Hi, Eric Reynolds, Plan Nine Comics.
Is the manager here?

12:30.516 --> 12:34.384
Well, I'm kinda the comanager.

12:36.222 --> 12:41.285
Tough break, toots.
I need a man who answers to no one.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.362
A full manager.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.897
Hotchie-machie.

12:46.999 --> 12:50.059
I can help you, sir.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.933
And I answer to no one.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.562
Hmm?

12:54.673 --> 12:58.541
Well, then you'll want to stock up
on our new superhero.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.340
Would you say he's
the ultimate superhero?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.415
Oh, very ultimate indeed.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.110
Point your peepers at Biclops!

13:06.218 --> 13:10.052
<i>A superhero with glasses!</i>

13:10.156 --> 13:13.182
Oh, yeah. Thick glasses.
Kinda like yours.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.387
So how many you need-
500, 600?

13:16.495 --> 13:19.328
- 600 sounds good.
- Aw, that's too bad.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.331
There's a price break
at a thousand.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.958
Oh, man!

13:28.607 --> 13:30.575
I'll take 2,000.

13:34.980 --> 13:40.179
The final frontier.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.254
<i>Out of the way, Tubby!</i>

13:42.354 --> 13:44.288
Well, pardon me, Oldie Hawn.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.326
Why, you ill-mannered sack of crap!

13:48.427 --> 13:52.363
Oh, goody. Now I know
whatever happened to BabyJane.

13:52.464 --> 13:57.492
You are the rudest man
who ever... bought me dinner.

13:57.603 --> 14:02.302
Correction. I do not believe
I have ever bought you- Oh.

14:13.652 --> 14:16.416
So how many issues of <i>Biclops</i>
would you like?

14:16.522 --> 14:20.014
Biclops?
Who's his girlfriend, Lois Lame?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.753
He's kinda afraid of girls.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.695
It doesn't even smack good.

14:25.798 --> 14:29.791
How could you spend all our money
on a comic book published by LensCrafters?

14:29.902 --> 14:31.733
We'll never sell these.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.670
Birds won't even use them in their nests.

14:39.011 --> 14:42.572
Okay! So I made
one bad decision!

14:42.681 --> 14:45.081
It's my fault for
leaving you in charge.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.311
Sometimes I forget
how young you are.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.319
I'm only three months
younger than you.

14:49.421 --> 14:53.016
Oh, look. You're getting cranky.
You haven't had your juice.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.094
Well, my straw broke off
in the carton.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.426
That's not the point!
We're supposed to be partners!

14:59.531 --> 15:02.432
And you're pushing me around
like a Playskool corn popper.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.661
It's a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.398
Whatever! I demand respect!

15:07.506 --> 15:13.138
I have feelings!
I'm a human boy, just like you!

15:13.245 --> 15:16.544
Shh. Use your indoor voice.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.981
Okay, that's it!

15:19.084 --> 15:21.245
Huh? Oh.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.195
<i>En garde!</i>

15:41.140 --> 15:43.040
Oh!

15:50.749 --> 15:53.684
Eat watering can, partner!

15:56.422 --> 15:58.117
Whoa!

15:58.223 --> 16:01.351
Comic Book Guy's secret stash.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.360
Look at all these bootleg videos.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.432
<i>Alien Autopsy.</i>
<i>Illegal Alien Autopsy.</i>

16:08.534 --> 16:10.399
Good Version.

16:10.502 --> 16:14.268
<i>He's got the tape</i>
<i>of Kent Brockman picking his nose.</i>

16:14.373 --> 16:17.342
Look! He's picking his nose!

16:26.018 --> 16:28.714
<i>I'll be right down.</i>

16:28.821 --> 16:31.688
<i>I'm just putting on my witch hazel.</i>

16:31.790 --> 16:34.850
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

16:34.960 --> 16:38.828
So, uh, your mother tells me you
go to Springfield Elementary.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.525
Exactly what is your interest
in my mother?

16:41.633 --> 16:46.400
- She makes me laugh.
- Here I come!

16:50.409 --> 16:54.505
Good Lord, Mother! I can see your... figure.

16:54.613 --> 16:58.606
Oh, you see a lot more
when you do my daily mole check.

16:58.717 --> 17:02.448
What I do for my allowance money
is nobody's business.

17:02.554 --> 17:04.579
He's not nobody.

17:04.690 --> 17:08.022
He might even be
your new daddy.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.932
"Police informant tape"?

17:15.034 --> 17:18.367
These are never supposed
to leave the station.

17:18.470 --> 17:21.496
- I really hate to be a snitch.
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

17:21.607 --> 17:25.167
<i>Your yellow-bellied ratting</i>
<i>will be held in the strictest confidence.</i>

17:25.277 --> 17:30.408
Well, in that case, my neighbor
Homer released a radioactive ape in my house.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.383
It's, uh- It's taken over
the whole top floor.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.477
It wasn't Dad's fault.
The ape tricked him.

17:36.588 --> 17:41.116
- What's next?
- "Mister Rogers Drunk."

17:44.296 --> 17:48.062
<i>Well, what do you mean</i>
<i>I can't take off my sweater?</i>

17:48.167 --> 17:52.194
- <i>I'm hot!</i>
- You know, I'll bet kids would pay to see this stuff.

17:52.304 --> 17:55.569
We could have a midnight screening
right here in the store!

17:55.674 --> 17:58.541
That's actually a great idea, Milhouse.

17:58.644 --> 18:02.171
Really? Well, I was due.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.909
I'll say... partner.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.109
So many restaurants.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.188
Oh, I can't decide!

18:10.289 --> 18:13.588
I throw myself on the mercy
of the food court!

18:14.927 --> 18:19.057
Um, I guess I'll have
the chicken tandoori.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.655
And I'll have the beef Wellington.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.771
Oh, look at you two.
You look so "coupley."

18:32.878 --> 18:34.903
Yes, well, we're a perfect match.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.413
Her sneer just lights up my day.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.314
And we're always finishing
each other's insults.

18:40.419 --> 18:42.614
<i>#And they called it #</i>

18:42.721 --> 18:47.590
<i># Puppy love #</i>

18:47.693 --> 18:50.025
<i># Oh, I guess they'll never know #</i>

18:53.398 --> 18:55.662
Oh, that does my heart good.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.894
<i># How a young heart #</i>

18:58.003 --> 19:00.870
<i># Really feels #</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:03.908
Oh!

19:04.009 --> 19:05.909
<i># And I love her so #</i>

19:06.011 --> 19:08.138
Sunsets.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.943
Thank God there's
only one of these a day.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.244
Could it be any more orange?

19:17.189 --> 19:19.919
I must warn you that
once this next tape starts...

19:20.025 --> 19:21.890
it will not stop...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.894
because that button is broken.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.658
Let's watch.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.859
If you are watching this tape,
you are the president of the United States.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.698
Hello, sir, or ma'am.
Hopefully sir.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.738
- Got that right.
- Yes!

19:34.840 --> 19:39.277
The town of Springfield has been classified
"N.W.B.," or "Nuclear Whipping Boy."

19:39.378 --> 19:42.575
In the first moments of a nuclear war,
Springfield will be bombed at will...

19:42.681 --> 19:45.115
by all friendly nations
to calibrate their missiles.

19:45.217 --> 19:46.980
Yea!

19:47.085 --> 19:50.782
Now for total security,
I will terminate the cameraman.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.449
<i>Thanks a lot, Steve!</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:59.194
All right, this is a raid.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.201
Well, well, well...

20:04.303 --> 20:07.329
this place has got more
pirated tapes than, uh-

20:07.439 --> 20:09.339
A Chinese Kmart?

20:09.441 --> 20:12.638
Well, that'll have to do.
Are these yours, son?

20:12.744 --> 20:16.874
No, sir. We were just exhibiting them
for profit without permission.

20:16.982 --> 20:21.510
Fair enough. But the owner is
in more hot water than-

20:21.620 --> 20:24.987
- AJapanese tea bag?
- Why don't you lay off the Asians, Lou?

20:30.362 --> 20:32.387
Well, you've changed me, Agnes.

20:32.497 --> 20:35.864
Maybe there is room
in my store for romance comics.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.835
Nobody'll buy those.
Your store smells.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.030
Now kiss me, funny face.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.409
All right! Oh!

20:45.510 --> 20:48.445
Oh, dear God!
Cover your eyes, boys!

20:48.547 --> 20:51.209
It's okay, man.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.341
If it doesn't affect you,
you're not human.

20:53.452 --> 20:57.752
Uh, Comic Book Guy, you're under arrest
for the possession of illegal videos.

20:57.856 --> 21:01.189
But we'll reduce the sentence
if you put your pants on... fast!

21:01.293 --> 21:04.194
- God!
- Come on, Romeo.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.429
They can't lock me up for long, Agnes.
Will you wait for me?

21:09.534 --> 21:12.901
Are you crazy?
My bones are half dust.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.374
Well, we may not have the store...

21:16.475 --> 21:18.375
but at least we're friends again.

21:18.477 --> 21:24.006
Yep. And we haven't been to school
in days and days and days.

21:24.116 --> 21:28.382
Oh, well. Looks like everything's
back to normal.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.655
Ow.

21:31.757 --> 21:36.387
Look, if you want me
to turn, just point. That's-

21:36.495 --> 21:40.022
Ow! It's one way!

21:40.132 --> 21:40.232
<i>Ow! Now what was that for?</i>

21:40.232 --> 21:42.530
<i>Ow! Now what was that for?</i>

21:42.634 --> 21:45.034
<i>Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

22:25.510 --> 22:27.410
Shh.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.345
<i>Why, you ill-mannered sack of crap!</i>
