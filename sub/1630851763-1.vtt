WEBVTT

01:10.838 --> 01:12.806
FEMALE NARRATOR:
It began as a holiday.

01:17.111 --> 01:19.513
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.,
college freshman,

01:19.647 --> 01:22.316
eager to escape a bright
future on the Great Plains,

01:22.450 --> 01:26.053
convinced his father,
proprietor of the Liberty,
Kansas Evening Sun,

01:26.187 --> 01:29.790
to fund his transatlantic
passage as an educational
opportunity

01:29.923 --> 01:31.425
to learn the family business

01:31.559 --> 01:34.162
through the production of
a series of travelogue columns

01:34.295 --> 01:37.965
to be published for
local readers in
the Sunday Picnic magazine.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.281
Over the next
ten years, he assembled a team

01:53.414 --> 01:55.849
of the best expatriate
journalists of his time

01:55.983 --> 02:00.388
and transformed Picnic
into The French Dispatch,

02:00.521 --> 02:04.425
a factual weekly report
on the subjects
of world politics,

02:04.558 --> 02:07.161
the arts,
high and low, fashion,

02:07.295 --> 02:08.796
fancy cuisine, fine drink,

02:08.929 --> 02:11.199
and diverse stories
of human interests

02:11.332 --> 02:13.100
set in faraway quartiers.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.638
He brought the world
to Kansas.

02:22.443 --> 02:26.180
His writers line the spines
of every good American
library.

02:27.715 --> 02:28.982
Berensen,

02:30.050 --> 02:31.519
Sazerac,

02:32.620 --> 02:33.987
Krementz,

02:35.489 --> 02:38.192
Roebuck Wright.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.328
One reporter known
as the best living writer

02:40.461 --> 02:43.397
in quality of sentences
per minute.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.666
One who never completed
a single article,

02:45.799 --> 02:49.370
but haunted the halls
cheerily for three decades.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.972
One privately blind writer
who wrote keenly

02:52.105 --> 02:53.173
through the eyes of others.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.477
FEMALE NARRATOR:
The uncontested crackerjack

02:56.610 --> 02:58.479
of grammatical expertise.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.684
Cover illustrations
by Hermes Jones.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.753
Famously gracious
with his writers,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.555
Arthur Jr. was less courteous

03:07.688 --> 03:09.523
with the rest of
the magazine's staff.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.459
Oh, no, what's that?

03:11.592 --> 03:13.026
I need a turkey.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.862
Stuffed and roasted
on a table

03:14.995 --> 03:16.196
with all the trimmings
and pilgrims!

03:16.330 --> 03:17.931
FEMALE NARRATOR:
His fiscal management system

03:18.065 --> 03:19.500
was convoluted but functional.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.403
Give her 150 francs
a week for the next 15 years

03:22.536 --> 03:25.406
against five American cents
per word, minus expenses.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.408
FEMALE NARRATOR:
His most repeated
literary advice,

03:27.541 --> 03:29.510
perhaps apocryphal,
was simply this...

03:29.643 --> 03:31.178
Just try to
make it sound like

03:31.312 --> 03:33.046
you wrote it that
way on purpose.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.515
FEMALE NARRATOR:
His return to Liberty

03:34.648 --> 03:37.518
comes precisely 50 years
after his departure,

03:37.651 --> 03:39.553
on the occasion
of his funeral,

03:39.687 --> 03:41.955
by which time the magazine's
circulation exceeds

03:42.089 --> 03:45.559
half a million subscribers
in 50 countries.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.861
A willow hamper
containing umpteen pins,

03:47.995 --> 03:49.363
plaques,
and official citations

03:49.497 --> 03:51.865
of the highest order
is buried at his side,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.534
along with
an Andretti Ribbon-mate

03:53.667 --> 03:56.770
and a ream of triple bond,
Egyptian cotton typing stock.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.211
He received
an Editor's burial.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.649
In his will,
he stipulated that

04:08.782 --> 04:11.585
immediately upon his death,
quote...

04:11.719 --> 04:13.220
The presses will be
dismantled

04:13.354 --> 04:14.455
and liquefied.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.924
The editorial offices will be
vacated and sold.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.859
The staff will be paid
ample bonuses

04:18.992 --> 04:20.328
and released
from their contracts,

04:20.461 --> 04:21.929
and the publication
of the magazine

04:22.062 --> 04:23.431
will permanently cease.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.599
Thus,

04:25.733 --> 04:28.068
the publisher's obituary
will also serve

04:28.201 --> 04:29.603
as that of this publication.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.073
All home delivery readers
will, of course,

04:33.206 --> 04:34.608
be refunded, pro rata

04:34.742 --> 04:37.110
for the unfulfilled portion
of their subscriptions.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.850
His epitaph will be taken
verbatim from the stenciled
shingle

04:42.983 --> 04:45.218
fixed above the door
of his inner office.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.154
Berensen's article.
The Concrete Masterpiece.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.989
Three dangling participles,
two split infinitives

04:49.122 --> 04:51.024
and nine spelling
errors in the first
sentence alone.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.726
Some of those
are intentional.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.996
The Krementz story,
Revisions to a Manifesto.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.431
We asked for
2,500 words,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.032
and she came in
at 14,000,

04:59.166 --> 05:01.168
plus footnotes,
endnotes, a glossary,
and two epilogues.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.936
ARTHUR:
It's one of her best.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.139
Sazerac?
Impossible to fact-check.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.975
He changes all the names
and only writes about

05:08.108 --> 05:09.276
hobos, pimps,
and junkies.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.944
These are his people.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.714
How about
Roebuck Wright?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.449
His door's locked,
but I could hear
the keys clacking.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.518
Don't rush him.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.952
The question is,
who gets killed?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.120
There's one piece
too many

05:20.253 --> 05:21.288
even if we print
another double-issue,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.357
which we can't afford
under any circumstances.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.829
A message from the foreman.
One hour to press.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.198
You're fired.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.401
Really?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.603
Don't cry
in my office.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.678
Shrink the masthead,
cut some ads,

05:44.812 --> 05:46.580
and tell the foreman
to buy more paper.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.616
I'm not killing anybody.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.553
Good writers.
He coddled them.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.456
He coaxed them.
He ferociously
protected them.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.525
What do you think?

05:57.658 --> 05:58.659
For myself?

05:59.693 --> 06:02.195
I would start with
Mr. Sazerac.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.197
FEMALE NARRATOR:
These were his people.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.785
Ennui rises suddenly
on a Monday.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.847
Through the time machine
of poetic license,

06:53.981 --> 06:55.716
let us take
a sight-seeing tour.

06:55.849 --> 06:59.920
A day in Ennui over
the course of 250 years.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.855
The great city
began as a cluster

07:01.989 --> 07:03.824
of tradesmen's villages.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.660
Only the names
remain unchanged.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.896
The Bootblack District.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.801
The Bricklayer's Quarter.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.438
The Butcher's Arcade.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.811
Pick-pocket Cul-de-Sac.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.116
On this site,
a fabled market,

07:29.249 --> 07:31.985
vending all forms of
victuals and comestibles

07:32.119 --> 07:33.386
under a single vast,

07:33.521 --> 07:36.089
glass-and-cast-iron
canopy,

07:36.223 --> 07:38.291
later demolished,
as you can see,

07:38.425 --> 07:40.961
in favor of a multi-level
shopping center

07:41.094 --> 07:42.596
and parking structure.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.032
Like every living city,

07:45.165 --> 07:48.602
Ennui supports a menagerie
of vermin and scavengers.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.272
The rats which colonized

07:52.405 --> 07:54.441
its subterranean railroad.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.977
The cats which colonized

07:57.110 --> 07:59.613
its slanty rooftops.

07:59.747 --> 08:01.214
The anguillettes
which colonized

08:01.348 --> 08:03.316
its shallow drainage canals.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.221
After receiving the Host,
marauding choirboys,

08:08.355 --> 08:10.290
half-drunk on
the Blood of Christ,

08:10.423 --> 08:11.792
stalk unwary pensioners

08:11.925 --> 08:14.127
and seek havoc.

08:15.362 --> 08:18.131
In the Flop Quarter, students.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.901
Hungry, restless, reckless.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.003
In the Hovel District,

08:23.136 --> 08:24.404
old people.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.044
Old people who have failed.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.949
The automobile.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.985
A mixed blessing.
On the one hand,

08:38.118 --> 08:39.519
the honking,
skidding, speeding,

08:39.653 --> 08:41.154
sputtering, and backfiring.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.658
The emission of toxic fumes
and filthy exhaust-pollution,

08:44.792 --> 08:46.159
the dangerous accidents,

08:46.293 --> 08:48.395
the constant traffic,
the high...

08:48.962 --> 08:50.698
Fuck!

08:50.831 --> 08:52.666
Department of
Local Statistics.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.969
Average rainfall,
750 millimeters.

08:56.103 --> 08:59.840
Average snowfall,
190,000 flakes.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.775
Eight-point-two-five
bodies are pulled

09:01.909 --> 09:03.376
from the Blase river
each week.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.012
A figure which
remains consistent

09:05.145 --> 09:06.413
despite population growth

09:06.546 --> 09:09.449
and advances in
health and hygiene.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.820
As the sun sets, a medley of
unregistered streetwalkers

09:12.953 --> 09:16.924
and gigolos replaces the day's
delivery boys and shopkeepers,

09:17.057 --> 09:20.694
and an air of promiscuous calm
saturates the hour.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.131
What sounds will
punctuate the night?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.668
And what mysteries
will they foretell?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.104
Perhaps the doubtful
old maxim speaks true.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.944
All grand beauties

09:37.077 --> 09:39.246
withhold their
deepest secrets.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.487
"Rats, vermin, gigolos,
streetwalkers."

09:47.621 --> 09:50.257
You don't think
it's almost too seedy
this time?

09:50.390 --> 09:52.092
No, I don't.
For decent people.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.794
It's supposed
to be charming.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.897
"Pick-pockets, dead bodies,
prisons, urinals..."

09:57.030 --> 09:58.899
You don't want to
add a flower shop

09:59.032 --> 10:00.233
or an art museum?
No, I don't.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.869
A pretty place
of some kind?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.637
I hate flowers.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.409
You could cut
the second half

10:09.542 --> 10:11.812
of the second paragraph,
by the way.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.847
You already
repeat it later.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.783
Okay.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.797
We take
as the subject of
tonight's lecture,

12:43.931 --> 12:46.066
the great painter
at the vanguard

12:46.199 --> 12:49.069
and heart of the French
Splatter-school Action-group,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.538
Mr. Moses Rosenthaler.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.640
Widely celebrated,
as you know,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.442
for the bold
dramatic style,

12:55.575 --> 12:57.911
and colossal scale
of his middle-period,

12:58.045 --> 12:59.712
in particular,
of course,

12:59.847 --> 13:02.249
the polyptych-tableaux
known as...

13:02.382 --> 13:05.485
Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing
Murals.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.321
He remains, in my opinion,
the most eloquent

13:08.455 --> 13:11.658
and certainly,
the loudest
artistic voice

13:11.791 --> 13:14.794
of his rowdy generation.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.865
How does this pivotal
piece come to find
its way

13:17.998 --> 13:21.301
into its unique position
as a permanent installation
here

13:21.434 --> 13:23.103
at the Clampette Collection?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.606
The story begins
in a mess hall.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.680
The exhibition,
Ashtrays, Pots,
and Macrame,

13:33.813 --> 13:36.483
a group show of handicrafts
by amateur artisans

13:36.616 --> 13:38.185
incarcerated in
the lunatic section

13:38.318 --> 13:39.752
of the Ennui Prison-Asylum,

13:39.887 --> 13:41.521
might, perhaps,
have been omitted

13:41.654 --> 13:43.156
from the annals
of art history,

13:43.290 --> 13:45.158
had it not been
for the inclusion

13:45.292 --> 13:46.960
in its number
of a small painting

13:47.094 --> 13:49.696
by Mr. Rosenthaler,
who was, at that time,

13:49.829 --> 13:51.231
serving a 50-year sentence

13:51.364 --> 13:52.765
for the crime of
double homicide,

13:52.900 --> 13:55.869
and the observation of that
work by a fellow inmate,

13:56.003 --> 13:58.872
the Levantine art dealer
Mr. Julian Cadazio,

13:59.006 --> 14:01.108
who, by fateful coincidence,
happened to be imprisoned

14:01.241 --> 14:02.876
in the adjoining annex
on a charge

14:03.010 --> 14:04.711
of second-degree
sales tax evasion.

14:05.778 --> 14:06.880
Guard.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.320
Who painted this picture?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.694
Citizen 7524.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.297
I believe that unit
designates maximum
security

14:24.431 --> 14:26.366
for the demented
and deranged.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.867
Are you able to
provide me an escort

14:28.001 --> 14:29.369
and a Friendly Visit Stamp

14:29.502 --> 14:31.138
for immediate use?

14:53.693 --> 14:56.529
Simone, Naked.
Cell Block J. Hobby Room.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.830
I wanna buy it.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.100
Why?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.434
Because I like it.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.937
It's not for sale.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.072
Yes, it is.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.108
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.409
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.178
No, it isn't.
It is, yes. It is.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.745
All artists sell
all their work.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.314
It's what makes you
an artist.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.750
Selling it. If you don't wish
to sell it, don't paint it.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.220
Question is,
what's your price?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.857
50 cigarettes.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.693
Actually, make it 75.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.063
Why do you keep
looking at that guard?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.304
She's Simone.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.274
Ah.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.982
I don't want to buy
this important piece
for 50 cigarettes.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.151
ROSENTHALER: 75.
Or 75 of prison currency.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.320
I want to pay you
250,000 francs

15:53.453 --> 15:54.421
in legal French tender.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.955
Do we agree on the sale?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.263
Uh-huh.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.498
I can only offer
a deposit of, uh...

16:05.632 --> 16:07.667
83 centimes,
one candied chestnut,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.069
and four cigarettes.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.271
Everything I have at this
present moment in time.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.673
However, if you'll accept
my signatory voucher,
I assure you

16:13.806 --> 16:15.008
a check for
the outstanding balance

16:15.142 --> 16:16.809
will be remitted to your
account within 90 days.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.311
Where do you bank?

16:18.845 --> 16:20.047
Never mind.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.472
How'd you learn to
do it, by the way?

16:45.605 --> 16:46.973
Paint this kind of picture.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.577
Also, who'd you murder,
and how crazy are you,
really?

16:50.710 --> 16:51.744
I need background
information

16:51.878 --> 16:53.646
so that we can do
a book about you.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.448
It makes you
more important.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.949
Who are you...

16:59.452 --> 17:01.054
Moses Rosenthaler?

17:04.124 --> 17:05.425
Born rich,

17:05.558 --> 17:08.895
the son of
a Jewish-Mexican
horse rancher,

17:09.028 --> 17:12.699
Miguel Sebastian Maria
Moises de Rosenthaler

17:12.832 --> 17:14.801
trained at
the Ecole des Antiquites

17:14.934 --> 17:16.836
at significant
family expense.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.672
But, by the end
of his youth,

17:19.806 --> 17:21.541
he had shed
all the luxuries

17:21.674 --> 17:24.777
of his comfortable
background and replaced
them with...

17:25.678 --> 17:26.846
Squalor.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.883
Hunger.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.021
Loneliness.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.759
Physical danger.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.166
Mental illness.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.203
And, of course...

17:52.038 --> 17:53.306
Criminal violence.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.894
He did not
pick up a brush

18:15.027 --> 18:16.095
during the first decade

18:16.229 --> 18:18.198
of his long prison sentence.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.257
Permission
to sign up for activity
privileges, gardienne.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.460
This thing?

19:26.766 --> 19:28.501
Citizen 7524,
address the class.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.569
What do you mean?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.837
Tell the group
about yourself.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.772
I don't wanna do that.
It's mandatory.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.541
They know me already.
That's not the point.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.976
I haven't even
prepared a speech.
Say something.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.989
Well, I've been here
3,647 days and nights.

19:52.024 --> 19:56.195
Another 14,603 to go.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.333
I drink 14 pints
of mouthwash rations
per week.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.169
At that rate,

20:03.303 --> 20:05.372
I think I'm going to
poison myself to death

20:05.505 --> 20:08.174
before I ever get to see
the world again,

20:09.442 --> 20:11.878
which makes me feel

20:12.712 --> 20:13.913
very sad.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.250
I gotta change my program.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.986
I gotta go in a new direction.

20:20.119 --> 20:24.357
Anything I can do to keep
my hands busy, I'm gonna do.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.860
Otherwise,

20:29.329 --> 20:32.064
I think maybe it's
gonna be a suicide.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.040
And that's why
I signed up

20:41.173 --> 20:42.942
for clay pottery
and basket weaving.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.579
My name is Moses.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.382
Take a pew.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.397
What's your name,
gardienne?

21:05.164 --> 21:06.265
Simone.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.443
Certain women
do gravitate toward
incarcerated men.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.178
It's a recognized condition.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.814
Something about
the captivity of others

21:21.948 --> 21:25.284
enhances the experience
of their own freedom.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.820
I assure you,
it's erotic.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.489
Look at her,
by the way.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.491
Born into
quasi-serfdom,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.259
16 brothers
and sisters.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.161
Illiterate until
she was 20.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.597
Now, a woman of
considerable property.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.931
Radiant.

21:39.065 --> 21:39.999
Good God.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.300
Wrong slide.
That's me.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.672
Simone, of course,
refused all

21:45.805 --> 21:47.507
Rosenthaler's
entreaties
of marriage,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.809
which, we are told,
were frequent

21:49.942 --> 21:52.679
and marvelously
enthusiastic.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.748
I wanna say it
as simple as I can.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.284
To try to shape it into words.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.388
The feelings in my heart.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.556
I don't love you.
I love you.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.992
What?
I don't love you.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.627
Already?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.795
Already what?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.363
Already how do
you know that?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.131
How can you be sure?
It's so quick.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.600
I'm sure.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.568
Ouch.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.570
That hurts me.

22:17.704 --> 22:21.073
The cruelty of it.
The cold-bloodedness.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.609
You said what
you wanted to say.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.043
I tried to stop you.
That's it.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.446
I said part of what
I wanted to say.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.781
I was in the middle
of it. There's more.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.216
No.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.185
No what? Will you...
No.

22:33.319 --> 22:34.353
Will you marry me?
No.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.115
I'm gonna need art supplies.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.454
Canvas, stretchers,
brushes, turpentine.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.355
What do you want to paint?

23:09.489 --> 23:10.990
The future.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.829
Which is you.

23:18.565 --> 23:21.468
Widely not considered
a great connoisseur,

23:21.601 --> 23:24.571
Julian Cadazio, nevertheless,
had an eye for something,

23:24.704 --> 23:27.440
and he did us all
a very good turn

23:27.574 --> 23:30.409
when the hour he was
released from prison...

23:35.948 --> 23:38.618
We're done with flowers
and fruit bowls.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.454
We're finished with
beaches and seascapes.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.190
We're getting out of armor,
rugs, and tapestries, too.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.125
I found something new.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.270
Modern art?

23:58.404 --> 24:00.640
Modern art.
Our specialty,
starting now.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.241
I don't get it.
Of course you don't.

24:02.374 --> 24:03.643
Am I too old?
Of course you are.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.745
Why is this good?
It isn't good.
Wrong idea.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.946
That's no answer.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.015
My point. You see
the girl in it?

24:09.148 --> 24:10.182
No.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.384
Trust me,
she's there.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.123
One way to tell if
a modern artist actually
knows what he's doing

24:17.256 --> 24:18.791
is to get him to
paint you a horse

24:18.925 --> 24:20.627
or a flower or
a sinking battleship,

24:20.760 --> 24:22.461
or something that's actually
supposed to look like

24:22.595 --> 24:24.864
the thing that it's actually
supposed to look like.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.800
Can he do it?
Look at this.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.336
Drawn in 45 seconds
right in front of me
with a burnt matchstick.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.639
A perfect sparrow.
That's excellent.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.806
May I keep it?

24:33.940 --> 24:35.441
Don't be stupid.
Of course not.

24:35.575 --> 24:38.477
The point is, he could
paint this beautifully
if he wanted,

24:38.611 --> 24:40.713
but he thinks
this is better.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.415
And I think I sort of
agree with him.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.953
Simone, Naked.
Cell Block J. Hobby Room
is probably a masterpiece

24:47.086 --> 24:50.089
worth a significant,
even exorbitant,
sum of money.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.124
But not yet.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.194
Hmm. The desire
must be created.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.463
Mmm.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.131
How long is he in for?

25:10.677 --> 25:13.012
CHIEF MAGISTRATE:
Mr. Rosenthaler,

25:13.145 --> 25:16.515
why should we put you
back on the street?

25:16.649 --> 25:19.018
Because it was
an accident,
Your Honor.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.889
I didn't intend
to kill anybody.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.158
You decapitated
two bartenders
with a meat saw.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.032
The first
bartender was an accident.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.803
The second one
was self-defense.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.405
Well, be that as it may,

25:39.538 --> 25:41.373
what demonstration
of genuine remorse,

25:41.507 --> 25:42.609
or, at the very least,

25:42.742 --> 25:45.344
regret can you offer
for beheading these men?

25:49.782 --> 25:51.651
They had it coming.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.253
I beg your pardon?
Forgive me. Uh...

25:55.755 --> 25:57.724
Is there a part of this
ritual where you ask

25:57.857 --> 26:00.526
if anybody has something
to say before it's too late?

26:00.660 --> 26:01.894
Like, at a wedding.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.063
No.
I'll be brief.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.970
We all know this man
is a murderer.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.305
Totally guilty of
first-degree homicide,

26:13.439 --> 26:14.707
any way you slice it.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.108
That's a given.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.411
However, he's also that rare
once-in-a-generation guy

26:19.545 --> 26:20.780
that you hear about,

26:20.913 --> 26:23.082
but never get the chance
to discover for yourself.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.786
An artistic genius.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.454
Surely, there ought
to be a double standard

26:28.587 --> 26:30.056
for this sort of
predicament.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.424
Supposedly,
he's a psychotic,
by the way.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.093
That's not his fault.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.696
Respectfully, I submit...

26:38.530 --> 26:41.901
maybe we could think up
some other way to
punish him?

26:42.034 --> 26:44.136
Rosenthaler's right
to petition for parole

26:44.270 --> 26:45.337
was permanently revoked

26:45.471 --> 26:46.839
for the duration
of his sentence.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.142
No further questions.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.544
Nevertheless,
Cadazio and his uncles

26:52.679 --> 26:54.146
were unanimous
in their decision

26:54.280 --> 26:57.149
to promote the artist
as his exclusive brokers

26:57.283 --> 26:59.085
throughout the free world.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.390
Simone travelled far and wide.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.827
The Ennui Salon.

27:10.296 --> 27:13.365
The Royal Exposition.

27:13.499 --> 27:16.368
The International Pavilion
at the Liberty, Kansas
State Fair,

27:16.502 --> 27:19.005
which was very nearly
burned to the ground.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.808
In short, the picture
was a sensation.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.545
Even the artist's all but
forgotten earlier work

27:26.679 --> 27:30.449
inspired wildly robust sales
on the secondary market.

27:32.051 --> 27:36.088
Meanwhile, Rosenthaler
continued to work
in confinement.

27:36.222 --> 27:39.759
Strikingly, the artist
favored raw materials
sourced

27:39.892 --> 27:42.661
exclusively from within
the prison-asylum domain.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.397
Powdered eggs.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.333
Pigeon blood.

27:47.466 --> 27:48.968
Shackle grease.

27:49.101 --> 27:50.937
Coal, cork, and dung.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.939
Fire, of course.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.841
Bright yellow scullery soap.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.844
And fresh cream of millet
as a binding agent.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.547
Simone liked to stand still.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.550
Indeed, she was Olympian
in her ability to hold

28:04.683 --> 28:05.885
extremely challenging
positions

28:06.018 --> 28:07.987
for extended
periods of time.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.022
She exhibited
very little vulnerability

28:10.156 --> 28:11.791
to extremes of heat or cold.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.727
After even the most adverse
forms of exposure,

28:14.861 --> 28:18.898
her skin remained unburned,
unblemished, un-goose-pimpled.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.266
Another tidbit.

28:20.399 --> 28:23.135
She genuinely enjoyed
the smell of turpentine

28:23.269 --> 28:25.571
and in later years
actually wore it

28:25.704 --> 28:27.406
in the application
of her toilet.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.843
She was more than a muse.

28:35.982 --> 28:37.416
Throw the switch.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.627
Throw the switch,
you cocksucker.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.335
What's wrong with you?
Go back to work.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.570
I can't.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.373
I won't. It's too hard.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.376
It's torture.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.847
I'm literally
a tortured artist.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.251
Poor baby.

29:12.985 --> 29:13.953
Get out.

29:30.736 --> 29:32.271
Is that what you want?

30:10.276 --> 30:11.844
What's your problem?

30:13.612 --> 30:15.347
I don't know what to paint.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.725
The French
Splatter-school
Action-group.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.529
A dynamic, talented,
lusty, slovenly,
alcoholic,

31:03.662 --> 31:06.198
violent pack of
creative savages.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.502
They inspired
and very often

31:10.636 --> 31:14.040
personally attacked
each other for
two decades and more.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.674
I'll have my drink now.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.615
Remember, in those days,
as you know,

31:23.749 --> 31:25.617
it was much more
socially acceptable

31:25.751 --> 31:27.819
for a painter or a sculptor

31:27.954 --> 31:31.223
to hit another fellow
with a chair
or even a brick

31:31.357 --> 31:33.993
or walk around
with a black eye

31:34.126 --> 31:36.762
or a broken tooth
and so on.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.266
Indeed, I'm jumping ahead,
but in my own experience,

31:40.399 --> 31:43.936
Rosenthaler could be quite
unpredictably impulsive.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.772
Uh, meaning, I refer to
the, uh, pigment locker

31:46.905 --> 31:49.075
beneath his studio in
the Boulevard des Plombiers,

31:49.208 --> 31:51.877
on one occasion,
he grabbed me
and put me in there,

31:52.011 --> 31:55.581
and inappropriately,
sort of, tried to fuck me

31:55.714 --> 31:58.050
against the wall
in the corner of
that pigment locker.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.387
He was crazy.
Officially certified.

32:11.197 --> 32:14.300
The Cadazios, of course,
represented them all.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.445
It's three years later.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.347
We've made you the most
famous painter alive

32:28.480 --> 32:31.417
based on one small,
scribbly,
overrated picture.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.951
You're an art school course.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.620
You're an encyclopedia entry.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.589
Even your disciples
have won and squandered
multiple fortunes,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.459
yet you refuse to show us
so much as a sketch or a study

32:40.592 --> 32:43.762
for a single new piece
during this entire,
protracted period.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.431
How long are
we meant to wait?

32:45.564 --> 32:47.599
Well, don't answer,
because we're not asking.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.536
We already printed
the invitations.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.204
We're coming in.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.473
All of us.
The collectors.
The critics.

32:54.606 --> 32:57.143
Even your second-rate
imitators we represent
who suck up to you

32:57.276 --> 33:00.079
and smuggle you goodies
and probably turn out to be
better than you are.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.014
The bribes alone
are going to be
outrageous,

33:02.148 --> 33:03.515
as these guards
can assure you.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.117
But we're gonna pay 'em.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.253
So, finish it,
whatever it is.

33:07.386 --> 33:08.820
The show is in two weeks.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.065
She thinks it's ready,
by the way.

33:19.598 --> 33:20.666
It's ready.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.537
I could use another year.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.042
My employer,
at that time,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.178
received the intriguing
summons

33:32.311 --> 33:34.213
by rapid-priority wire.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.983
I refer, of course,
to Upshur "Maw" Clampette.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.320
Astute collector
of antiquities.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.089
Great friend
to the avant-garde.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.923
Her collection,
even in its infancy,

33:45.057 --> 33:46.525
was well-known
and important,

33:46.658 --> 33:48.094
as was her residence,

33:48.227 --> 33:50.362
Ingo Steen's first
American commission

33:50.496 --> 33:54.200
informally known as
the Doorstop House.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.535
It was my duty,
and I may say,

33:56.668 --> 33:58.504
my privilege
to catalogue,

33:58.637 --> 34:00.239
archive, and advise,

34:00.372 --> 34:02.074
although she did
whatever the hell
she wanted,

34:02.208 --> 34:04.743
no matter what you
told her, anyway.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.912
Thus, we began
the long journey

34:07.045 --> 34:10.216
from Liberty to Ennui.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.219
My dear
Mrs. Clampette,
Maw, if I may,

34:13.352 --> 34:15.020
please join us
for the first display

34:15.154 --> 34:18.090
of Mr. Moses Rosenthaler's
extremely exciting new work,

34:18.224 --> 34:20.459
which I, myself, have not yet
been permitted to see.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.262
In order to facilitate
the viewing in
a timely fashion,

34:23.395 --> 34:24.763
it may prove necessary for us

34:24.896 --> 34:26.998
to surreptitiously gain
access to the facility

34:27.133 --> 34:29.335
where the artist
currently resides.

34:29.468 --> 34:30.569
Please rely on my operatives

34:30.702 --> 34:32.104
to organize any
and all details

34:32.238 --> 34:34.005
and preparations
for your visit.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.408
Caution, do not bring
matches, lighters,

34:36.542 --> 34:38.410
or sharp objects of any kind.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.413
We await your confirmation
with cheerful anticipation.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.749
Yours most truly,
Cadazio Uncles

34:43.882 --> 34:45.617
and Nephew Galerie concern.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.056
The paddy wagon
collected us

34:51.190 --> 34:53.492
directly after the night's
final round of working girls
and revelers

34:53.625 --> 34:56.395
were delivered
to the drunk tank at 3:00 a.m.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.943
Moses, are you here?

35:46.345 --> 35:48.046
Mmm-hmm.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.881
Any words
of introduction?

35:50.015 --> 35:53.452
Or perhaps, a welcome
to our wonderful guests,
some of whom

35:53.585 --> 35:56.054
have traveled a great distance
to come see your work, I hope?

35:56.188 --> 35:58.957
Or, alternatively,
just, I don't know.

35:59.625 --> 36:00.626
Hello?

36:03.128 --> 36:04.996
Quiet, please!

36:06.565 --> 36:08.133
Quiet, please!

36:12.070 --> 36:14.373
I did it. It's good!
This is historic.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.174
Open the champagne!
I did it.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.509
Music!

36:23.615 --> 36:25.183
Why are you sitting
in a wheelchair
like an invalid?

36:25.317 --> 36:27.219
You should be dancing
on the tables!
It's a triumph!

36:32.458 --> 36:33.859
Do you like it?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.328
Do I like it?

36:37.028 --> 36:38.797
Yes.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.705
Look at Maw,
she's mesmerized.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.776
This here's a fresco,
t'weren't it?

36:50.909 --> 36:53.712
Precisely. He's a Renaissance
master of the highest order.

36:53.845 --> 36:56.848
He mines the same vein
as Piperno Pierluigi
when he illuminated

36:56.982 --> 37:00.085
The Christ Before God's
Heavenly Altar in 1565.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.921
Maw, nobody has an eye
for things nobody has
ever seen

37:03.054 --> 37:05.090
like Maw Clampette
of Liberty, Kansas.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.593
We should be ashamed
to even gather
in her presence.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.227
Why the fuck
did she say fresco?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.998
Are they painted
into the walls?

37:13.865 --> 37:16.067
Oh, no. What has he done?

37:16.735 --> 37:18.637
You fucking asshole.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.038
Are you seeing this?
Look at this!

37:20.171 --> 37:22.207
Well, I think it's
utterly wonderful.
It's crucial!

37:22.341 --> 37:24.810
It's probably a turning point
in the evolution
of human pictography.

37:24.943 --> 37:25.977
Scratched and plastered

37:26.111 --> 37:28.213
into a reinforced cement
aggregate gymnasium.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.715
He even painted
onto the radiators!

37:29.848 --> 37:31.483
Maybe one of them
restoration fellers

37:31.617 --> 37:33.619
out at the Fondazione
dell'Arte Classico

37:33.752 --> 37:35.754
could figure a way to
rustle them pictures loose.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.723
We're in
a maximum-security
prison, Maw.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.391
It's federal property.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.527
Even to begin
the bureaucratic nightmare
would require years

37:41.660 --> 37:43.194
of negotiation with
a team of highly-paid,

37:43.329 --> 37:44.896
arrogant,
obnoxious advocates.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.533
I don't even know how
you'd peel them off.
It's a fresco.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.636
Hey! It's a fresco!

37:51.570 --> 37:52.904
So what?

37:53.038 --> 37:55.240
Can you even begin
to fathom the shit-ton
of money

37:55.374 --> 37:58.510
my uncles and I have
squandered to get to
this point of no return?

37:58.644 --> 37:59.778
Look at them!

38:01.380 --> 38:02.314
You've ruined us!

38:02.448 --> 38:04.115
Does it mean nothing to you?

38:04.249 --> 38:05.651
I thought you liked it.

38:05.784 --> 38:09.154
I think it stinks!

38:09.287 --> 38:10.822
Get out of that wheelchair!

38:10.956 --> 38:13.725
I'm going to kick your ass
up and down this hobby room!

38:15.861 --> 38:18.797
Don't growl at me,
you convicted murderer.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.766
You homicidal, suicidal,

38:20.899 --> 38:23.502
psychopathic,
no-talent drunk!

38:48.093 --> 38:50.095
Why didn't you
tell me, gardienne?

38:51.129 --> 38:53.231
Because you would've
stopped him.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.640
We have to accept it.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.575
His need to fail
is more powerful

39:03.709 --> 39:06.512
than our strongest desires
to help him succeed.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.714
I give up.
He's defeated us.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.149
He's defeated us.
Sad, but there it is.

39:12.751 --> 39:16.054
Anyway, at least,
he finished
the motherfucker.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.190
It is, perhaps,
the most interesting

39:19.324 --> 39:20.892
contemplation of
peripheral vision

39:21.026 --> 39:22.561
I've ever seen.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.937
Well done, Moses.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.183
Well done, Moses.
This has a greatness to it.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.521
If you plastered it
deep enough, it may last.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.024
We'll come and see it
again one day.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.626
God willing.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.195
You'll already still
be here, of course.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.266
It's all Simone.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.649
At that moment,

40:17.783 --> 40:20.018
they were both aware
of Simone's intention

40:20.151 --> 40:21.419
to leave her position

40:21.553 --> 40:23.622
at the Ennui Prison-Asylum
the following day,

40:23.755 --> 40:26.291
endowed with funds
provided by the Cadazios

40:26.424 --> 40:27.826
as compensation for her work

40:27.959 --> 40:31.329
as Rosenthaler's model
and muse.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.999
She was reunited with
the estranged child to whom

40:34.132 --> 40:35.901
she had given birth
in her youth,

40:36.034 --> 40:39.471
and the two never again
lived apart.

40:39.605 --> 40:42.373
She and Rosenthaler maintained
a regular correspondence

40:42.508 --> 40:44.275
for the rest
of the artist's life.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.250
Mrs. Clampette would like
to put the piece on hold.

40:53.685 --> 40:54.720
The half-sticker?

40:54.853 --> 40:56.054
Yes, please.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.623
Should she choose
to finalize the sale,

40:57.756 --> 41:00.526
will this amount be acceptable
to you and your uncles?

41:04.295 --> 41:06.431
Can we get a deposit?

41:06.565 --> 41:09.334
Maw? An advance against
the total sum?

41:11.136 --> 41:14.339
Tell them stingy Frenchmen
I ain't making no promises.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.774
BERENSEN:
Ten Reinforced Cement

41:15.907 --> 41:17.342
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals

41:17.475 --> 41:19.911
was to remain on hold under
the name Upshur Clampette

41:20.045 --> 41:22.447
for the subsequent 20 years.

41:22.581 --> 41:23.682
Monsieur Cadazio?

41:26.652 --> 41:27.719
Which prisoners?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.458
Tell them
we don't bribe

41:33.592 --> 41:35.326
rapists and pickpockets.
It's unethical.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.296
Besides, I didn't bring
an additional 6,000,000
francs in small bills.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.638
How'd you get out there?

41:46.772 --> 41:47.773
What do we do?

41:48.607 --> 41:49.675
Lock the door.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.653
In the aftermath,
72 prisoners

42:01.787 --> 42:03.822
and six members of
the French Splatter-school

42:03.955 --> 42:06.257
lay dead or mortally wounded.

42:06.391 --> 42:09.527
Moses Rosenthaler,
for acts of extreme valor,

42:09.661 --> 42:11.930
which saved the lives
of nine guards,

42:12.063 --> 42:13.832
22 distinguished visitors,

42:13.965 --> 42:16.034
and the Ministers
of Culture and Urbanity,

42:16.167 --> 42:19.470
received his freedom
with probation for life.

42:21.607 --> 42:24.375
And was decorated in
the Order of the Caged Lion.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.217
One score later,

42:32.350 --> 42:34.920
as per Maw Clampette's
detailed instructions,

42:35.053 --> 42:36.722
Cadazio and his own nephews

42:36.855 --> 42:39.124
arranged for the entirety
of the hobby room

42:39.257 --> 42:41.960
to be relocated onboard
a Goliath aviation

42:42.093 --> 42:43.895
12-engine artillery transport

42:44.029 --> 42:46.932
directly from
Ennui to Liberty.

42:51.369 --> 42:54.773
In this form,
the avant-garde
assumed its place

42:54.906 --> 42:57.342
upon the plains
of Central Kansas.

43:09.888 --> 43:12.090
"Pencils, pens,
erasers, thumbtacks,

43:12.223 --> 43:15.093
"pushpins, typewriter
repairman."

43:15.226 --> 43:17.963
Why am I paying for
a hotel room at
a beach club

43:18.096 --> 43:19.297
on the North Atlantic coast?

43:19.430 --> 43:21.967
Because I had
to go there to write it.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.936
"Breakfast, lunch, dinner,
laundry, nightcap, midnight
snack."

43:25.070 --> 43:27.272
What is wrong
with the desk

43:27.405 --> 43:29.107
right here
in your office?

43:29.240 --> 43:30.541
Courtesy of
this magazine.

43:30.676 --> 43:31.910
Don't ask me
to be indiscreet

43:32.043 --> 43:33.578
about what happened
between me and Moses

43:33.712 --> 43:36.114
at a seaside inn
20 years ago.
We were lovers.

43:36.247 --> 43:37.916
I went back
to remember.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.651
On my dime.

43:39.785 --> 43:40.919
Yes, please.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.089
Add it up.

44:06.111 --> 44:07.445
March 1st.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.782
Negotiations between
undergraduates

44:10.916 --> 44:12.183
and the university
administration

44:12.317 --> 44:14.119
break down abruptly
in early morning hours

44:14.252 --> 44:16.955
after clamorous debate,
angry name-calling

44:17.088 --> 44:20.291
and, finally,
outright gambling over

44:20.425 --> 44:22.360
the right of free access
to the girls' dormitory

44:22.493 --> 44:24.830
for all male students.

44:24.963 --> 44:27.098
The protest which
ended in a stalemate...

44:30.601 --> 44:33.004
...gave
the superficial appearance
of a vanity exercise

44:33.138 --> 44:35.240
for the pimple-cream
and wet-dream contingent.

44:38.777 --> 44:41.913
But, in fact, the sexes were
equally represented.

44:42.047 --> 44:43.381
Young lady,

44:44.149 --> 44:45.150
shoes!

44:46.985 --> 44:50.255
And all participants
emphasized the basis
of their frustration,

44:50.388 --> 44:53.491
a desire, more,
a biological need

44:54.325 --> 44:56.561
for freedom. Full stop.

44:57.796 --> 44:59.530
It has exploded into symbolism

44:59.664 --> 45:01.499
and everybody's
talking about it.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.237
March 5th.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.073
Late supper at the B's.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.842
Eldest boy, 19, not home
since yesterday morning.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.212
Father chanced upon him
midday,

45:14.345 --> 45:15.713
marching alongside
his comrades.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.515
Their slogan...

45:17.648 --> 45:19.517
"The children are grumpy."

45:20.018 --> 45:21.452
Thank you.

45:21.586 --> 45:23.721
An additional dinner guest,
thus far, fails to appear.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.190
For this, I am grateful.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.658
Had not been informed of
his invitation in first place.

45:27.793 --> 45:29.027
We didn't mean
to offend you.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.695
We're sorry.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.697
We thought
you might decline
the invitation

45:32.831 --> 45:34.032
if we warned you.

45:34.165 --> 45:35.934
You were right.
Yeah.

45:36.067 --> 45:37.903
Local news reports
aggressive crowd-control
methods...

45:38.036 --> 45:40.205
...in use on street
today. Quote...

45:40.338 --> 45:41.372
Just give him
a chance.

45:41.506 --> 45:43.241
He's very intelligent.

45:43.374 --> 45:45.210
So,
how long has it been
since what's-his-name?

45:45.343 --> 45:46.611
I know you mean well.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.815
"It begins with a prickly
tingling of the exposed skin."

45:54.652 --> 45:56.587
I'm not an old maid.

45:56.721 --> 45:58.389
We don't think that.

45:58.523 --> 46:00.258
Of course you're not.

46:00.391 --> 46:03.194
"Then,
a reddening and swelling
of the orbital muscles."

46:03.328 --> 46:04.863
Take me at my word.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.798
I live by myself on purpose.

46:06.932 --> 46:09.100
I prefer relationships
that end.

46:09.234 --> 46:12.137
I deliberately choose to have
neither husband nor children.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.572
The two greatest deterrents
to any woman's attempt

46:14.705 --> 46:16.741
to live by and for writing.

46:16.875 --> 46:17.843
Why are we crying?

46:17.976 --> 46:19.177
Because it's sad.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.411
We don't want
you to be alone.

46:20.545 --> 46:21.980
Loneliness
is a kind of poverty.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.348
I'm not sad.
My eyes hurt.

46:23.481 --> 46:24.582
There's something wrong

46:24.715 --> 46:26.484
with your apartment.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.987
"Finally, a barrage of
searing pain as snot
pours from the nostrils

46:29.120 --> 46:30.721
"and the throat spasms
and constricts."

46:30.856 --> 46:31.923
MR. B.: Don't breathe.

46:45.103 --> 46:46.471
I'm naked,
Mrs. Krementz.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.539
I can see that.

46:48.673 --> 46:50.608
Why are you crying?
Tear gas.

46:50.741 --> 46:51.776
Also,

46:52.911 --> 46:54.512
I suppose I'm sad.

46:57.282 --> 46:59.584
Please turn away.
I feel shy about
my new muscles.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.524
Go tell your parents
you're home.
They're worried.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.759
I'm expected
back on the barricades.

47:08.894 --> 47:10.261
I didn't see any barricades.

47:10.395 --> 47:12.697
Well, we're still
constructing them.

47:12.830 --> 47:13.798
Uh-huh.

47:13.932 --> 47:15.000
What are you writing?

47:15.133 --> 47:16.401
A manifesto.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.503
I told them not to
invite Paul, by the way.

47:18.636 --> 47:21.139
Maybe you're sad,
but you don't seem
lonely to me.

47:21.272 --> 47:22.640
Exactly!

47:22.773 --> 47:25.143
I saw you at the protest
on top of a bookcase
taking notes.

47:25.276 --> 47:28.013
Is there a story in us?
For the people of Kansas.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.180
Maybe.

47:29.314 --> 47:30.548
Then you should study
our resolutions.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.183
Or, anyway,
will you proofread it?

47:32.317 --> 47:33.784
My parents think
you're a good writer.

47:35.186 --> 47:36.187
Give it to me.

47:45.964 --> 47:47.265
It's a little damp.

47:48.499 --> 47:49.834
Physically
or metaphorically?

47:49.968 --> 47:52.537
Both. Based on the cover
and the first four sentences.

47:52.670 --> 47:54.372
Don't criticize
my manifesto.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.740
Oh, you don't want remarks?

47:55.873 --> 47:57.242
I don't need remarks,
do I?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.244
I only asked you to
proofread it 'cause
I thought you'd be

47:59.377 --> 48:00.979
even more impressed
by how good it already is.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.648
Let's start with the typos.

48:03.781 --> 48:07.185
Can the faculty succeed
if the students fail?

48:07.318 --> 48:09.187
It remains to be seen.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.322
MR. B.: Ah. Paul Duval.
Lucinda Krementz.

48:11.456 --> 48:12.523
How do you do?

48:13.691 --> 48:16.227
Your beard
is scratching me.

48:16.361 --> 48:19.931
Unexpected guest finally
arrives. Looks like hell.

48:20.065 --> 48:21.967
Describes odyssey across city.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.634
Stalled trains, stalled buses,

48:23.768 --> 48:26.972
broken windows, paving stones
flying in all directions.

48:28.173 --> 48:30.441
Anyway, we're here.

48:30.575 --> 48:33.378
The famous Lucinda.
Hello.

48:33.511 --> 48:35.580
I did not know you were
coming. They did not tell me.

48:35.713 --> 48:37.715
This is not
an official meeting.

48:43.754 --> 48:44.755
Good evening.

48:54.232 --> 48:55.333
KREMENTZ:
Start without me.

49:09.514 --> 49:10.815
March 10th.

49:10.948 --> 49:13.218
City services at a halt,
one week and counting.

49:13.351 --> 49:15.586
Public transportation,
suspended.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.789
Piles of garbage, uncollected.
Schools on strike.

49:18.923 --> 49:20.591
No mail, no milk.

49:20.725 --> 49:21.826
It's me again.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.261
KREMENTZ:
What will normal reality be?

49:23.394 --> 49:25.296
Next week, next month,
whenever, if ever,

49:25.430 --> 49:27.165
we get the chance
to experience it again.

49:27.765 --> 49:28.699
Anyone's guess.

49:28.833 --> 49:30.135
What's this part?

49:30.268 --> 49:31.802
I added an appendix.

49:31.936 --> 49:33.171
You're joking.
No, I'm not.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.106
You finished my manifesto
without me.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.008
I made it sound
like you, I think.

49:37.142 --> 49:38.476
Just more clear,
more concise,

49:38.609 --> 49:40.178
a bit less poetic.

49:40.311 --> 49:43.348
Put it this way,
this isn't the first
manifesto I've proofread.

49:48.286 --> 49:50.121
Impossible to imagine
these students,

49:50.255 --> 49:52.823
exhilarated, naive,
brave in the extreme...

49:54.325 --> 49:57.328
...returning to their
obedient classrooms.

50:05.170 --> 50:06.671
Who was that?

50:06.804 --> 50:08.306
Your mother.
My mother.

50:08.439 --> 50:10.108
My mother?

50:10.241 --> 50:11.776
What did she want?
Did you tell her
I was here?

50:11.909 --> 50:13.544
Yes.
Why?

50:13.678 --> 50:15.346
Because she asked.
I don't lie.

50:15.980 --> 50:17.048
Was she upset?

50:17.182 --> 50:18.216
I don't think so.

50:18.349 --> 50:20.185
What did she say?
She nodded.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.852
What did you say?

50:21.986 --> 50:24.155
I told her I was working
on an article about you
and your friends.

50:24.955 --> 50:26.224
So, you are.

50:26.357 --> 50:28.326
I've already written
1,000 words.

50:28.459 --> 50:29.860
I asked to interview her.

50:29.994 --> 50:32.263
Did she agree?
Yes, of course.

50:34.532 --> 50:35.666
Well, I am upset!

50:35.800 --> 50:37.868
I don't know how to feel.

50:38.002 --> 50:40.471
Am I in trouble? Why would
my mother be so calm?

50:40.605 --> 50:42.340
Is this proper?

50:42.473 --> 50:45.143
This is all off-the-record.
Everything. My whole life.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.247
What am I supposed
to do now?

50:50.681 --> 50:53.050
I should maintain
journalistic neutrality.

50:56.321 --> 50:57.622
Ooh.

51:02.693 --> 51:05.029
I like how
ruthless you are.

51:05.163 --> 51:07.232
It's part of
your beauty, I think.

51:09.167 --> 51:11.536
So, you've got
1,000 words already, huh?

51:14.139 --> 51:15.440
The kids did this.

51:15.573 --> 51:18.109
Obliterated 1,000 years
of Republican authority

51:18.243 --> 51:19.710
in less than a fortnight.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.479
How and why?

51:21.612 --> 51:24.215
Before it began,
where did it begin?

51:30.221 --> 51:33.158
ZEFFIRELLI:
It was another time.
It was another Ennui.

51:33.291 --> 51:37.595
Must be nearly six months ago,
I guess. My sisters
were still 12, anyway.

51:43.668 --> 51:46.137
You danced to the Craze
and the Lait Chaud.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.208
You wore your hairdo
in the Pompidou,

51:50.341 --> 51:52.243
the Crouton,
or the Fruits-de-Mer.

51:53.578 --> 51:55.246
Your slang mixed
bits of Latin

51:55.380 --> 51:57.682
with philosophy jargon
and manual signaling.

51:59.584 --> 52:02.187
Devil's advocates bickered
and debated perpetually,
ad nauseam,

52:02.320 --> 52:03.954
only for the sake of argument.

52:07.024 --> 52:08.759
Every clique had a rival.

52:11.896 --> 52:14.899
The Nuts had the Bolts.
The Sticks had the Stones.

52:15.032 --> 52:17.101
The Jocks had us,
the Bookworms,

52:17.235 --> 52:18.736
until Mitch-Mitch failed
the baccalaureate

52:18.869 --> 52:21.306
and got sent down
to National Duty-obligation.

52:21.439 --> 52:23.508
Three months
in the Mustard Region.

52:58.876 --> 53:00.545
He was sent
to the Mustard Region

53:00.678 --> 53:01.846
for National Duty-obligation.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.917
I'm sorry?

53:07.818 --> 53:08.919
How dare you?

53:09.053 --> 53:10.555
Who gave you permission
to besmirch our friend?

53:10.688 --> 53:12.790
Does it occur to you
he's very probably
somewhere marching

53:12.923 --> 53:14.525
in the middle of
the night right now,

53:14.659 --> 53:16.894
carrying a 50-pound
sack of gunpowder
and peeling stale potatoes

53:17.027 --> 53:19.664
while he digs a latrine trench
in the rain with a tin cup?

53:19.797 --> 53:21.399
He doesn't want
to be in the military.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.608
Easy for you to say

53:30.741 --> 53:32.510
from the comfort
of the Sans Blague.

53:40.184 --> 53:41.986
Mitch-Mitch,
what are you doing here?

53:42.119 --> 53:43.354
You're supposed to be
in the Mustard Region

53:43.488 --> 53:44.855
for another two months.

53:44.989 --> 53:46.891
Five years later,
I, myself, translated

53:47.024 --> 53:49.159
Mitch-Mitch Simca's
poetic interpretation

53:49.294 --> 53:51.596
of his National
Duty-obligation service.

53:55.065 --> 53:58.235
The flashback scene
in Act Two
of Goodbye, Zeffirelli.

53:58.369 --> 54:01.406
In North Africa,
I caught a bullet
in the tail.

54:01.539 --> 54:02.873
In South America,
I caught a chunk of

54:03.007 --> 54:05.476
high-explosive shrapnel
in the left wing.

54:05.610 --> 54:07.211
In East Asia,
I picked up a rare,

54:07.345 --> 54:08.879
microbial,
infectious gut-parasite

54:09.013 --> 54:10.448
in the lower
abdominal cavity,

54:10.581 --> 54:12.717
and I've got them
all with me right now,

54:12.850 --> 54:14.919
still in my body,

54:15.052 --> 54:18.689
but I don't regret
my choice to wear
this uniform.

54:18.823 --> 54:21.559
And in 16 years,
I'll get my pension.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.262
Well, that's your bedtime
story, ladies. Lights out!

54:25.396 --> 54:26.697
Hup! Ho! Hut!
Lights out!

54:26.831 --> 54:28.132
Covers tucked! Blankets on!

54:28.265 --> 54:29.967
-Pray your prayers!
-Sir!

54:34.739 --> 54:37.308
Amen. Amen. Amen.

54:40.978 --> 54:42.079
Psst.

54:45.082 --> 54:47.217
Psst, Mitch-Mitch. Psst.

54:47.352 --> 54:49.920
Psst, Mitch-Mitch.
What do you wanna be?

54:50.054 --> 54:51.155
MITCH-MITCH: What?

54:51.288 --> 54:53.624
What do you want
to be, Mitch-Mitch?

54:53.758 --> 54:56.594
With my grades,
I'll be an assistant
pharmacist.

54:56.727 --> 54:58.796
Will that make you
be satisfied?

54:58.929 --> 55:01.599
It won't depress me.
I should have studied
harder.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.100
And you, Robouchon?

55:03.233 --> 55:04.502
Oh, I have no choice.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.437
I'll work for my father's
glass factory.

55:06.571 --> 55:09.306
Someone has to take over.
It's normal.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.308
Vaugirard.
What's your plan?

55:11.442 --> 55:13.511
I suppose I'll continue
to be an attractive wastrel

55:13.644 --> 55:15.346
like my cousins on
both sides of the family.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.181
Your cousins are the best.
I love your cousins.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.417
Yeah.
What about you, Morisot?

55:21.419 --> 55:23.187
Morisot, what do
you want to be?

55:25.790 --> 55:26.991
A protestor.

55:28.426 --> 55:30.995
What'd he say?
He said, "A protestor."

55:31.128 --> 55:33.030
What does he mean?
I don't know.

55:33.163 --> 55:34.865
I thought Morisot
was supposed to be

55:34.999 --> 55:36.567
a professor of
geological chemistry.

55:36.701 --> 55:38.202
Morisot's crying.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.237
Shh!
Who said "shh"?

55:40.371 --> 55:41.506
I won't do it.

55:43.307 --> 55:44.742
It's only eight more weeks,
Morisot,

55:44.875 --> 55:46.511
before we complete
the program.

55:46.644 --> 55:48.312
I don't mean the program.

55:50.314 --> 55:53.350
I mean from when we go home
until retirement age.

55:53.484 --> 55:55.886
That 48-year period
of my life, I mean.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.822
That's what I won't do.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.758
I can no longer
envision myself

56:00.891 --> 56:03.193
as a grown-up man
in our parents' world.

56:12.036 --> 56:14.439
Morisot! He went
out the window!

56:16.273 --> 56:17.875
Is he dead?
I don't know.

56:18.008 --> 56:19.209
How far did he fall?

56:19.343 --> 56:20.711
Five floors
with high ceilings.

56:20.845 --> 56:23.213
It rained last night.
Maybe the mud's
still soft.

56:23.347 --> 56:24.482
He's not moving.

56:26.116 --> 56:27.485
He's still not moving.

56:29.119 --> 56:30.421
He's still not moving.

56:31.756 --> 56:33.057
He's still not moving.

56:34.158 --> 56:35.526
He's still not moving.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.562
He's still not moving.

56:38.529 --> 56:39.797
He's still not moving.

57:09.527 --> 57:10.828
The next morning,

57:10.961 --> 57:13.163
Mitch-Mitch was arrested
for Desertion and Desecration,

57:13.297 --> 57:14.832
and the Sans Blague
became headquarters

57:14.965 --> 57:16.266
for the Movement
of Young Idealists

57:16.400 --> 57:17.502
for the Revolutionary
Overthrow

57:17.635 --> 57:19.269
of Reactionary
Neo-liberal Society.

57:19.403 --> 57:20.437
What are you doing?

57:23.107 --> 57:24.274
They can live together.

57:25.242 --> 57:26.744
Tip-top with Charvet.

58:08.018 --> 58:11.155
There followed,
a brisk, unpredictable
tit-for-tat.

58:11.288 --> 58:13.524
between Ennui's elders
and its youngers.

58:14.825 --> 58:16.260
August.

58:16.393 --> 58:19.396
Community Whisper Campaign
denounces student movement.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.599
September.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.268
Sans Blague coffee license
revoked by official decree.

58:26.303 --> 58:27.605
October.

58:27.738 --> 58:29.674
Propaganda Committee
erects pirate radio tower

58:29.807 --> 58:31.609
on Physics Department rooftop.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.378
November.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.214
Meal plan blockade of
the undergraduate cafeteria.

58:38.148 --> 58:39.550
December.

58:39.684 --> 58:41.986
Check-out protest at
the Bibliotheque Principale.

58:42.119 --> 58:44.354
Entire library circulation
legally removed

58:44.488 --> 58:48.192
until five minutes before
incur of massive overdue
book fines.

58:48.325 --> 58:49.526
January.

58:49.660 --> 58:51.596
Mitch-Mitch released
to parental custody.

58:53.197 --> 58:54.632
February.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.400
The girls' dormitory uprising.

58:58.002 --> 59:00.304
It all, in the end,
leads to...

59:01.138 --> 59:02.072
March.

59:02.206 --> 59:03.808
The chessboard revolution.

1:00:01.231 --> 1:00:02.532
What page you on?

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:11.308
I think so.
By definition.

1:00:20.751 --> 1:00:22.787
In spite of the purity
of their cause,

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:25.622
to create a free, borderless,
utopian civilization,

1:00:25.756 --> 1:00:27.424
the students, nevertheless,

1:00:27.557 --> 1:00:30.094
split into factions
before fully uniting
in first place.

1:00:36.066 --> 1:00:37.735
One thing is now
finally clear,

1:00:37.868 --> 1:00:39.336
they are answering
their parents.

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:42.106
What do they want?
To defend their illusions.

1:00:42.239 --> 1:00:43.674
A luminous abstraction.

1:00:51.148 --> 1:00:53.383
I am convinced they are better
than we were.

1:01:10.067 --> 1:01:12.469
Mrs. Krementz
suggested it, actually.
The appendix.

1:01:14.604 --> 1:01:16.573
Polished it.
Certain passages.

1:01:33.123 --> 1:01:34.458
I inscribed it to you.

1:01:34.591 --> 1:01:35.559
Oh.

1:01:42.299 --> 1:01:43.500
Remind myself,

1:01:43.633 --> 1:01:45.602
"You are a guest
at this manifestation.

1:01:45.736 --> 1:01:49.273
"Not my fight.
Stay out of it, Lucinda.
Keep your mouth shut."

1:01:49.406 --> 1:01:51.441
I have to say something.

1:01:51.575 --> 1:01:54.111
You're a very
bright girl, Juliette.

1:01:54.244 --> 1:01:56.914
If you put away
your powder puff for
one minute, forgive me,

1:01:57.047 --> 1:01:59.149
and think for yourself
for one minute, forgive me,

1:01:59.283 --> 1:02:01.485
you might realize
you're all in this together.

1:02:01.618 --> 1:02:03.020
Even the riot police.

1:02:11.028 --> 1:02:12.396
Our move.

1:02:17.501 --> 1:02:19.703
That was impolite. Of me.

1:02:19.837 --> 1:02:21.571
I withdraw the remark.

1:02:24.408 --> 1:02:25.776
I beg your pardon.

1:02:27.912 --> 1:02:28.913
I'm sorry.

1:02:30.881 --> 1:02:31.916
Thank you.

1:02:33.217 --> 1:02:34.384
You're sure?

1:02:39.890 --> 1:02:41.425
Sure you're not a child?

1:02:43.928 --> 1:02:46.997
Then learn
to accept an apology.
That's important.

1:02:52.903 --> 1:02:53.938
Grown-ups.

1:02:57.041 --> 1:02:58.642
Our move.
The mayor's waiting.

1:03:19.596 --> 1:03:21.665
Kindly leave me my dignity.

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:25.836
She's not an old maid.
She's not in love with me.

1:03:25.970 --> 1:03:27.637
She's our friend.
I'm her friend.

1:03:27.771 --> 1:03:30.107
She's confused.
She wants to help us.

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.642
She's angry.
She's a very good writer.

1:03:34.144 --> 1:03:36.680
It's a lonely life,
isn't it?

1:03:38.215 --> 1:03:40.650
Sometimes.

1:03:40.784 --> 1:03:43.854
It's true. I should maintain
journalistic neutrality,

1:03:43.988 --> 1:03:45.289
if it exists.

1:03:47.291 --> 1:03:49.960
Please excuse me,
Mrs. Krementz.

1:04:15.986 --> 1:04:18.155
It's just fireworks.

1:04:18.288 --> 1:04:20.190
She's the best of them.

1:04:20.324 --> 1:04:22.927
Stop bickering.
Go make love.

1:04:27.831 --> 1:04:30.100
Me, too.
Except for Mrs. Krementz.

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:32.569
I thought so.

1:04:45.615 --> 1:04:46.816
March 15th.

1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:54.925
Discover on flyleaf of
my composition book
a hasty paragraph.

1:04:55.059 --> 1:04:57.561
Not sure when Zeffirelli
had the chance to write it.

1:04:57.694 --> 1:05:00.130
Late that night while I slept?

1:05:00.264 --> 1:05:02.566
Poetic, not necessarily
in a bad way.

1:05:02.699 --> 1:05:04.234
Reads as follows...

1:05:08.405 --> 1:05:10.707
Post script
to a burst appendix.

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:13.277
An invincible comet speeds
on its guided arc

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:16.880
toward the outer reaches
of the galaxy in cosmic
space-time.

1:05:17.014 --> 1:05:18.715
What was our cause?

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:22.987
Recollection of two memories.

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:25.589
You. Soap scent of
drugstore shampoo,

1:05:25.722 --> 1:05:29.426
ashtray of stale cigarettes,
burnt toast.

1:05:29.559 --> 1:05:31.728
Her. Perfume of
cheap gasoline,

1:05:31.861 --> 1:05:35.932
coffee on the breath,
too much sugar,
cocoa butter skin.

1:05:36.066 --> 1:05:37.434
Where does she
spend her summers?

1:05:39.169 --> 1:05:41.305
They say it's the smells
you finally don't forget.

1:05:41.438 --> 1:05:42.906
The brain works that way.

1:05:44.074 --> 1:05:45.875
I've never read
my mother's books.

1:05:46.010 --> 1:05:49.146
I'm told my father was
really quite remarkable
during the last war.

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:50.647
Best parents I know.

1:05:52.382 --> 1:05:54.284
The girls' dormitory.

1:05:54.418 --> 1:05:55.652
First time I've come inside,

1:05:55.785 --> 1:05:58.622
except to vandalize it
during demonstrations.

1:05:58.755 --> 1:06:02.826
I said, "Don't criticize
my manifesto." She said...

1:06:04.928 --> 1:06:07.931
I feel shy about
my new muscles.

1:06:08.065 --> 1:06:11.301
Her large, stupid eyes
watched me pee.

1:06:15.139 --> 1:06:17.007
A thousand kisses later,

1:06:17.141 --> 1:06:20.310
will she still remember
the taste of my tool on
the tip of her tongue?

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:25.849
Apologies, Mrs. Krementz.
I know you despise
crude language.

1:06:32.289 --> 1:06:33.957
Additional sentence
at bottom of page

1:06:34.091 --> 1:06:37.094
completely indecipherable
due to poor penmanship.

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:46.436
"Revisions to a Manifesto.
Page four, asterisk one.

1:06:48.472 --> 1:06:49.706
"The promotion of..."

1:07:09.659 --> 1:07:10.760
I'll be right back.

1:07:18.502 --> 1:07:20.036
Zeffirelli!

1:07:49.899 --> 1:07:51.835
He is not an invincible comet

1:07:51.968 --> 1:07:53.703
speeding on its guided arc

1:07:53.837 --> 1:07:56.506
toward the outer reaches
of the galaxy in cosmic
space-time.

1:07:59.776 --> 1:08:02.312
Rather, he is a boy
who will die young.

1:08:04.047 --> 1:08:06.483
He will drown on this planet

1:08:06.616 --> 1:08:09.386
in the steady current
of the deep, dirty,
magnificent river

1:08:09.519 --> 1:08:11.955
that flows night and day
through the veins and arteries

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:13.623
of his own ancient city.

1:08:15.859 --> 1:08:18.228
His parents will receive
a telephone call at midnight,

1:08:18.362 --> 1:08:20.230
dress briskly, mechanically,

1:08:20.364 --> 1:08:21.998
and hold hands
in the silent taxi

1:08:22.132 --> 1:08:24.734
as they go to identify
the body of their cold son.

1:08:27.271 --> 1:08:30.374
His likeness, mass-produced
and shrink-wrap packaged,

1:08:30.507 --> 1:08:33.042
will be sold like bubblegum
to the hero-inspired

1:08:33.177 --> 1:08:36.480
who hope to see
themselves like this.

1:08:36.613 --> 1:08:38.715
The touching narcissism
of the young.

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:56.466
March 30th.

1:09:01.238 --> 1:09:03.807
Across the street,
a glaring metaphor.

1:09:03.940 --> 1:09:06.142
Bell rings,
pupils scamper inside

1:09:06.276 --> 1:09:08.178
back to their
obedient classrooms.

1:09:13.683 --> 1:09:16.853
A creaky swing sways
in the deserted schoolyard.

1:09:28.498 --> 1:09:29.466
Come in!

1:10:18.482 --> 1:10:22.185
Someone told me you have
a photographic memory.

1:10:22.319 --> 1:10:24.854
Is that true?
That is false.

1:10:24.988 --> 1:10:27.223
I have
a typographic memory.

1:10:27.357 --> 1:10:29.125
I recollect
the written word

1:10:29.259 --> 1:10:30.794
with considerable
accuracy and detail.

1:10:30.927 --> 1:10:33.196
In other spheres,
my powers of retention

1:10:33.330 --> 1:10:35.532
are distinctly
impressionistic.

1:10:35.665 --> 1:10:38.768
I'm known to my intimates
as a most forgetful man.

1:10:38.902 --> 1:10:40.069
Yet you remember

1:10:40.203 --> 1:10:41.771
every word you ever wrote.
Hmm.

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:44.274
The novels, the essays,
the poems, the plays...

1:10:44.408 --> 1:10:47.210
The unrequited valentines.
Sadly, I do.

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:49.413
May I test you?

1:10:49.546 --> 1:10:50.747
If you must.

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:53.783
Unless we try the patience
of your viewership,

1:10:53.917 --> 1:10:58.254
or the esteemed spokesmen
for Gemini tooth powder?

1:10:58.388 --> 1:11:00.724
My favorite piece
is the one about the cook,

1:11:00.857 --> 1:11:02.692
where the kidnappers
get poisoned.

1:11:02.826 --> 1:11:05.495
"Do students of the table
dream in flavors?

1:11:05.629 --> 1:11:09.132
"That was the first of
the questions a reporter
for this magazine

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:11.635
"had diligently prepared
in advance of his encounter

1:11:11.768 --> 1:11:13.603
"with Lieutenant Nescaffier,

1:11:13.737 --> 1:11:17.006
"ranking chef at
District Headquarters on
the narrow river-peninsula

1:11:17.140 --> 1:11:20.009
"known as
the Rognure d'Ongle.

1:11:20.143 --> 1:11:22.111
"All such queries
were to remain unanswered

1:11:22.245 --> 1:11:24.180
"in the course of
that eventful evening."

1:11:25.449 --> 1:11:27.116
Shall I carry on?

1:11:27.817 --> 1:11:28.918
Please.

1:11:33.423 --> 1:11:35.659
I'd arrived
insufficiently early.

1:11:38.094 --> 1:11:39.963
Though the suite of rooms
on the penultimate floor

1:11:40.096 --> 1:11:43.400
of the grand edifice was
hypothetically indicated
on a floorplan

1:11:43.533 --> 1:11:45.402
provided on the back
of the carte de degustation...

1:11:48.372 --> 1:11:50.740
it was nigh impossible
to locate,

1:11:50.874 --> 1:11:52.241
at least for this reporter.

1:11:52.376 --> 1:11:54.578
A weakness in cartography.

1:11:54.711 --> 1:11:56.513
The curse of the homosexual.

1:12:02.085 --> 1:12:04.187
Monsieur Nescaffier made
his name and reputation.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:07.524
He is fanatically celebrated
among cooks, cops,
and capitaines,

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:10.394
not to mention squealers,
stoolies, and snitches,

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:12.962
as the great exemplar
of the mode of cuisine

1:12:13.096 --> 1:12:15.732
known as
Gastronomie Gendarmique.

1:12:20.604 --> 1:12:21.805
"Police cooking" began

1:12:21.938 --> 1:12:24.007
with the stake-out picnic
and paddy-wagon snack,

1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:26.576
but has evolved and codified
into something refined,

1:12:26.710 --> 1:12:29.813
intensely nourishing,
and, if executed properly,

1:12:29.946 --> 1:12:31.648
marvelously flavorful.

1:12:33.016 --> 1:12:34.050
Fundamentals...

1:12:34.183 --> 1:12:36.185
highly portable,
rich in protein,

1:12:36.319 --> 1:12:38.187
eaten with the non-dominant
hand only,

1:12:38.321 --> 1:12:40.490
the other being reserved
for firearms and paperwork.

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:51.968
Most dishes are served
pre-cut. Nothing crunchy.

1:12:52.101 --> 1:12:53.403
Quiet food.

1:12:56.139 --> 1:12:59.142
Sauces are dehydrated
and ground to a powder
to avoid spillage

1:12:59.275 --> 1:13:01.310
and the risk of
the tainting of
a crime scene.

1:13:03.212 --> 1:13:06.249
Diners are expected
to provide their own
fourchettes de poche,

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.217
often engraved with
the arcane mottoes

1:13:08.351 --> 1:13:10.787
and off-color sayings of
their respective precincts.

1:13:37.614 --> 1:13:40.149
How are you planning
to kill me?

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.088
I believe this to be

1:13:45.221 --> 1:13:47.524
a case of mistaken identity.

1:13:51.394 --> 1:13:55.064
Have you been
in the chicken coop
for a very long while?

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:03.439
I beg your pardon.

1:14:17.654 --> 1:14:20.023
Monsieur Nescaffier,
even during his apprenticeship

1:14:20.156 --> 1:14:21.691
in a provincial
fire department,

1:14:21.825 --> 1:14:23.793
aspired to a lofty perch,

1:14:23.927 --> 1:14:26.362
and there can be
no higher position
in the metier than that of

1:14:26.496 --> 1:14:28.865
Chef Cuisinier
for the private dining room

1:14:28.998 --> 1:14:31.434
of the Commissaire
de la Police Municipale.

1:14:40.577 --> 1:14:42.478
Forgive my tardiness.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.282
No, not at all.
Not at all.

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:51.020
Mr. Wright,
may I present my mother

1:14:51.154 --> 1:14:53.690
Louise de la Villatte.
You can call her Maman.

1:14:53.823 --> 1:14:55.424
We all do.
Bonsoir, monsieur.

1:14:55.559 --> 1:14:57.927
THE COMMISSAIRE:
This is my oldest friend,
Chou-fleur.

1:14:58.061 --> 1:15:00.930
When I met him,
he was a girlish
little schoolboy

1:15:01.064 --> 1:15:03.800
with ringlets
and a full set of teeth.

1:15:03.933 --> 1:15:07.170
Now, he looks like a corpse.

1:15:07.303 --> 1:15:09.272
In the corner,
Patrolman Maupassant.

1:15:09.405 --> 1:15:11.374
He'll be serving.

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:13.342
Cocktails.
Oui, monsieur.

1:15:17.046 --> 1:15:18.815
THE COMMISSAIRE:
And this is my son, Gigi,

1:15:18.948 --> 1:15:20.183
in the crime-lab smock.

1:15:20.316 --> 1:15:23.587
What are you stealing
from my personal records?

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:25.689
Unsolved cases.

1:15:25.822 --> 1:15:27.557
THE COMMISSAIRE:
Well, say hello to Mr. Wright.

1:15:27.691 --> 1:15:28.925
Hello, Mr. Wright.

1:15:29.058 --> 1:15:30.426
Hello, Gigi.

1:15:31.561 --> 1:15:34.831
Full name,
Isadore Sharif de la Villatte.

1:15:37.033 --> 1:15:39.002
The Commissaire
and his only son,

1:15:39.135 --> 1:15:42.105
widowered and motherless,
left the colony where
the boy was born,

1:15:42.238 --> 1:15:44.507
cemented together
by their shared grief.

1:15:44.641 --> 1:15:45.975
Gigi was six.

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:48.277
His schoolrooms

1:15:48.411 --> 1:15:50.213
were the station house
and the squad car.

1:15:51.547 --> 1:15:53.382
He was educated
by forensic tutors

1:15:53.516 --> 1:15:55.251
in the traditions
of law enforcement.

1:15:56.820 --> 1:15:58.688
His first drawings
were facial composites

1:15:58.822 --> 1:16:00.423
based on eyewitness testimony.

1:16:03.359 --> 1:16:06.362
His first words
were in Morse code.

1:16:06.495 --> 1:16:09.532
It was, I suppose,
wonderfully obvious.

1:16:09.666 --> 1:16:12.702
He was brought up to succeed
the Commissaire himself.

1:16:14.638 --> 1:16:16.806
Yes, I've read you.
In the magazine.

1:16:18.241 --> 1:16:20.309
To your satisfaction?

1:16:20.443 --> 1:16:22.311
Of course. Of course.

1:16:22.445 --> 1:16:23.713
Good writer.

1:16:26.282 --> 1:16:29.252
I trust you are already
familiar with this genius.

1:16:29.385 --> 1:16:31.054
At least by reputation.

1:16:31.187 --> 1:16:32.656
Lieutenant Nescaffier.

1:16:32.789 --> 1:16:33.990
I surely am.

1:16:47.436 --> 1:16:50.373
The drink, a milky,
purplish aperitif,

1:16:50.506 --> 1:16:52.942
ferociously fragrant,
overtly medicinal,

1:16:53.076 --> 1:16:54.744
ever so faintly anesthetizing

1:16:54.878 --> 1:16:57.881
and cooled
to a glacial viscosity
in a miniature version

1:16:58.014 --> 1:16:59.382
of the type of vacuum-flask

1:16:59.515 --> 1:17:02.251
normally associated with
campsites and schoolrooms,

1:17:02.385 --> 1:17:03.720
cast a spell,

1:17:03.853 --> 1:17:06.289
which, during the subsequent
60-second interval,

1:17:06.422 --> 1:17:08.391
was to be mortally broken.

1:17:08.524 --> 1:17:10.894
On three overlapping
dramatic timelines,

1:17:11.027 --> 1:17:13.096
the following events
came to pass.

1:17:16.866 --> 1:17:19.035
One.

1:17:19.168 --> 1:17:22.271
Monsieur Nescaffier began
his mysterious ritual.

1:17:22.405 --> 1:17:24.107
I can neither comprehend
nor describe

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:25.842
what occurs behind
a kitchen door.

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:27.977
I have always been content
to enjoy the issue

1:17:28.111 --> 1:17:30.814
of an artist's talent
without unveiling
the secrets of the chisel

1:17:30.947 --> 1:17:32.481
or the turpentine.

1:17:33.616 --> 1:17:34.684
Two.

1:17:40.256 --> 1:17:41.725
Patrolman Maupassant,

1:17:41.858 --> 1:17:44.060
responding to an infrequently
illuminated signal,

1:17:44.193 --> 1:17:45.995
delivered a telephone
to his superior.

1:17:53.669 --> 1:17:55.171
Go ahead.

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:00.810
As you know by now,

1:18:00.944 --> 1:18:02.045
we have kidnapped your son

1:18:02.178 --> 1:18:03.379
and absconded
to a secure location

1:18:03.512 --> 1:18:04.647
which you will never discover.

1:18:04.781 --> 1:18:06.783
Release or execute the Abacus

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:09.385
and the little boy
will be safely returned
to your custody.

1:18:09.518 --> 1:18:12.956
Failure to do so by sun-up
will result in your son's
violent death.

1:18:20.363 --> 1:18:21.831
Three.

1:18:21.965 --> 1:18:23.599
The skylight window
of the makeshift nursery

1:18:23.733 --> 1:18:26.836
which occupies the attic
quarters jimmied ajar.

1:19:01.204 --> 1:19:04.173
The getaway
and eventual motor pursuit
was rendered vividly,

1:19:04.307 --> 1:19:06.275
if, perhaps, a bit fancifully,
in a comic strip

1:19:06.409 --> 1:19:08.077
published the following week.

1:19:42.912 --> 1:19:44.948
Though the infamous
Ennui gang war

1:19:45.081 --> 1:19:46.749
"Winter Crimewave"
had eradicated

1:19:46.883 --> 1:19:48.684
a healthy number of
thugs and hooligans,

1:19:48.818 --> 1:19:50.519
it had also claimed the lives

1:19:50.653 --> 1:19:53.422
of a disgraceful proportion
of innocent citizens.

1:19:55.391 --> 1:19:57.894
Due to the surprise capture
of the racketeering accountant

1:19:58.027 --> 1:19:59.395
Albert "the Abacus",

1:19:59.528 --> 1:20:01.564
in possession of a valise
containing payroll stubs

1:20:01.697 --> 1:20:04.267
for all three of
the city's major syndicates,

1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:07.170
the law-abiding community's
hopes for an accelerated
resolution

1:20:07.303 --> 1:20:09.438
to the crisis
had been renewed.

1:20:14.577 --> 1:20:17.646
However, this turn of events
had forcefully rattled
the cages

1:20:17.780 --> 1:20:19.983
of the denizens
of the criminal underworld.

1:20:26.322 --> 1:20:29.458
For myself, I had failed
to recognize the Abacus,

1:20:29.592 --> 1:20:32.295
but as it happened,
I knew the chicken coop.

1:20:32.428 --> 1:20:34.130
This is not in the article,
by the way.

1:20:34.263 --> 1:20:36.465
If I refer to Mr. Howitzer,
do you know who I mean?

1:20:36.599 --> 1:20:38.201
Of course.
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.

1:20:38.334 --> 1:20:40.336
Founder and editor
of The French Dispatch.

1:20:40.469 --> 1:20:43.806
It was my first week
in Ennui when I suffered
the misfortune

1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:46.575
of being arrested in
a drinking establishment

1:20:46.709 --> 1:20:48.811
on the fringes of
the Flop Quarter

1:20:48.945 --> 1:20:52.348
along with a number of
newly-found companions.

1:20:52.481 --> 1:20:54.050
What was the charge?

1:20:54.483 --> 1:20:56.619
Love.

1:20:56.752 --> 1:20:59.155
You see, people may
or may not be
mildly threatened

1:20:59.288 --> 1:21:01.790
by your anger,
your hatred, your pride,

1:21:01.925 --> 1:21:04.227
but love the wrong way

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.163
and you will find yourself
in great jeopardy.

1:21:07.296 --> 1:21:10.799
In this case,
a chicken coop jail cell
for six days straight.

1:21:10.934 --> 1:21:14.470
I had no one who cared
to rescue me, and no one
who cared to scold me.

1:21:14.603 --> 1:21:18.908
And the only local number
committed to my typographic
memory was

1:21:19.042 --> 1:21:21.177
Printer's District 9-2211.

1:21:21.310 --> 1:21:22.578
While I regret
we are unable

1:21:22.711 --> 1:21:25.048
to publish either
of these specific pieces,

1:21:25.181 --> 1:21:28.251
I would be very pleased
to consider other submissions
in the future.

1:21:28.384 --> 1:21:30.519
Or if you find yourself
in Ennui...

1:21:36.359 --> 1:21:38.261
I'd never
met the man.

1:21:38.394 --> 1:21:41.630
I knew how to reach him
only because I wanted a job.

1:22:00.316 --> 1:22:02.851
Let's see here.

1:22:02.986 --> 1:22:06.022
High school newspaper,
poetry club, drama society.

1:22:06.155 --> 1:22:09.025
Wrote the school song.
Words and music.

1:22:09.158 --> 1:22:12.428
Junior researcher,
cub reporter,
assistant editor.

1:22:12.561 --> 1:22:13.696
Fires and murders.

1:22:13.829 --> 1:22:15.064
That's how I started.

1:22:15.198 --> 1:22:17.266
My father owned
the paper, of course.

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:20.036
Bit of sports, bit of crime,
bit of politics.

1:22:20.169 --> 1:22:22.405
Shortlisted twice,
Best Essays.

1:22:22.538 --> 1:22:25.041
Deep South, Midwest,
East Coast.

1:22:25.174 --> 1:22:27.110
Vast country.

1:22:27.243 --> 1:22:29.612
Haven't been there
in 20 years.

1:22:29.745 --> 1:22:33.582
Not now. I'm conducting
a job interview.

1:22:33.716 --> 1:22:36.519
Your writing samples are good.
I re-read them in the taxi.

1:22:36.652 --> 1:22:38.254
Have you ever done
any book reviews?

1:22:39.555 --> 1:22:41.157
Never.

1:22:41.290 --> 1:22:43.759
You're gonna be in there
another few hours before
they process you out.

1:22:45.928 --> 1:22:48.331
Read this.
Give me 300 words.

1:22:48.464 --> 1:22:52.701
I'll pay you 500 francs
minus the 250 I advanced
for your bail,

1:22:52.835 --> 1:22:56.039
but I'll re-advance that
against cost of living.

1:22:56.172 --> 1:22:58.674
Bring me a first draft
tomorrow morning

1:22:58.807 --> 1:23:01.144
and however you go
about it, Mr. Wright,

1:23:01.277 --> 1:23:04.280
try to make it sound like
you wrote it that way
on purpose.

1:23:12.588 --> 1:23:13.822
Thank you.

1:23:16.392 --> 1:23:17.793
No crying.

1:23:25.934 --> 1:23:28.304
It came to be known
as the "Night of
a Thousand Slugs."

1:23:28.437 --> 1:23:30.206
I'm reciting again.

1:23:30.339 --> 1:23:33.176
How the Commissaire
and his elite team of
experts and analysts

1:23:33.309 --> 1:23:36.879
succeeded so swiftly
in determining the location
of the kidnappers' lair...

1:23:40.883 --> 1:23:41.884
Well...

1:23:46.222 --> 1:23:47.890
I just don't know.

1:23:51.294 --> 1:23:53.496
The tools of the trade,
I suppose.

1:24:00.303 --> 1:24:02.338
But succeed they did.

1:24:36.872 --> 1:24:38.207
Who were they?

1:24:40.042 --> 1:24:41.410
It was later revealed.

1:24:42.578 --> 1:24:44.613
A hired crew of
bandits and gunmen

1:24:44.747 --> 1:24:46.982
imported by the ranking bosses
of the Ennui rackets

1:24:47.116 --> 1:24:49.585
and their network
of underworld middlemen.

1:24:51.387 --> 1:24:56.225
Chauffeur Joe Lefevre,
a once almost promising
instrumentalist.

1:24:56.359 --> 1:24:58.927
Stetson, Spinster,
and Hieronymus Von Altman,

1:24:59.061 --> 1:25:00.996
Dutch masterminds.

1:25:01.130 --> 1:25:04.600
Marconi Brutelli,
the Mediterranean anarchist.

1:25:05.768 --> 1:25:08.537
A pair of hooligans,
estranged cousins.

1:25:09.872 --> 1:25:13.041
A trio of showgirls,
all junkies.

1:25:15.077 --> 1:25:17.112
Plus one small,
resourceful prisoner,

1:25:17.246 --> 1:25:20.583
determined to free himself
and reduce taxpayer expense.

1:25:31.527 --> 1:25:32.595
What's that noise?

1:25:34.330 --> 1:25:37.466
Uh, air bubbles
in the radiator pipes.
It's pressurized.

1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:39.202
Sounds like Morse code.

1:25:40.636 --> 1:25:42.438
Vaguely, maybe.

1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:46.809
I'm Gigi, by the way.
What's your name?

1:25:46.942 --> 1:25:50.513
I'm not gonna tell you that.
This is a felony.

1:25:50.646 --> 1:25:54.049
You're not a criminal.
You're just a mixed-up
showgirl.

1:25:54.183 --> 1:25:56.519
Ha.
Ha, yourself.

1:25:57.152 --> 1:25:58.354
Shut up.

1:25:59.288 --> 1:26:00.689
What color eyes
do you have?

1:26:00.823 --> 1:26:02.057
Blue?

1:26:11.567 --> 1:26:12.668
Hello.

1:26:14.337 --> 1:26:15.538
Hello.

1:26:19.842 --> 1:26:21.644
Sing me a lullaby.

1:26:21.777 --> 1:26:23.178
I'm scared.

1:26:52.475 --> 1:26:54.377
Are you asleep?

1:26:55.344 --> 1:26:56.412
Uh-huh.

1:27:00.416 --> 1:27:03.719
The Commissaire
adored Gigi with all his
voluminous heart.

1:27:03.852 --> 1:27:05.354
However, his mind,

1:27:05.488 --> 1:27:07.222
that exceptional machine
for the detection

1:27:07.356 --> 1:27:09.392
and investigation
of criminal activity,

1:27:11.026 --> 1:27:12.828
had been whirring
since dinnertime.

1:27:14.463 --> 1:27:16.399
Diner.
Diner.

1:27:16.532 --> 1:27:19.402
And he was in a condition
of dire calorific depletion.

1:27:22.004 --> 1:27:23.939
Nescaffier, back in the field

1:27:24.072 --> 1:27:25.874
for the first time
in six years,

1:27:26.008 --> 1:27:28.076
came prepared to dazzle.

1:27:30.078 --> 1:27:32.281
Diner.

1:27:32.415 --> 1:27:35.183
The change was instantaneous.

1:27:40.723 --> 1:27:42.758
Mmm.

1:27:42.891 --> 1:27:44.126
Nescaffier.

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:45.728
Even as
the faintest hints

1:27:45.861 --> 1:27:47.630
of the aromas of
the great chef's kitchen

1:27:47.763 --> 1:27:49.832
ribboned into
the Commissaire's nostrils,

1:27:49.965 --> 1:27:51.734
he began to
envision and formulate

1:27:51.867 --> 1:27:54.102
a multi-pronged battle-plan.

1:27:54.236 --> 1:27:55.371
To start...

1:27:55.504 --> 1:27:57.239
Deviled eggs of
the precinct canary

1:27:57.373 --> 1:27:59.475
served in shells of
its own meringue.

1:28:01.810 --> 1:28:02.778
Next...

1:28:04.046 --> 1:28:05.414
Kidneys.

1:28:05.548 --> 1:28:08.116
Poached with plums from
the mayor's rooftop arbor.

1:28:10.919 --> 1:28:11.920
Then...

1:28:13.121 --> 1:28:15.958
minced lamb bon-bons
in pastry wrappers.

1:28:17.292 --> 1:28:18.961
Blase oyster soup.

1:28:20.429 --> 1:28:22.398
A magnificent
city-park pigeon hash.

1:28:22.531 --> 1:28:23.566
Finally...

1:28:25.133 --> 1:28:26.935
...tabac pudding
with quadruple cream.

1:28:30.439 --> 1:28:31.940
May I interrupt
with a question?

1:28:32.074 --> 1:28:33.241
Please.
Forgive me.

1:28:33.376 --> 1:28:34.910
Just permit me to dog-ear
the page. Mentally.

1:28:35.043 --> 1:28:36.412
I beg your pardon.

1:28:36.545 --> 1:28:38.313
You've written about
the American negro,

1:28:38.447 --> 1:28:39.582
the French intellectual,

1:28:39.715 --> 1:28:41.517
the Southern romantic...
And the anti-negro.

1:28:41.650 --> 1:28:43.452
The anti-negro.

1:28:43.586 --> 1:28:45.954
Scripture, mythology,
folklore,

1:28:46.088 --> 1:28:48.391
true crime, false crime,

1:28:48.524 --> 1:28:50.893
the ghost story,
the picaresque,
the bildungsroman.

1:28:51.026 --> 1:28:53.028
But more than anything,
over all these years,

1:28:53.161 --> 1:28:54.797
you've written about food.

1:28:55.197 --> 1:28:56.499
Why?

1:28:57.700 --> 1:29:00.503
Who? What? Where? When?
How? Valid questions,

1:29:00.636 --> 1:29:03.238
but I learned
as a cub stringer,

1:29:03.372 --> 1:29:05.140
never, under any circumstance,

1:29:05.273 --> 1:29:08.644
if it is remotely
within your power
to resist the impulse,

1:29:08.777 --> 1:29:10.913
never ask a man why.

1:29:11.046 --> 1:29:13.382
It... It tightens a fellow up.

1:29:13.516 --> 1:29:14.517
I apologize,
but I'm gonna

1:29:14.650 --> 1:29:16.018
hold you to it...
Torture.

1:29:16.151 --> 1:29:17.686
...if you'll agree.

1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:20.956
Self-reflection is a vice
best conducted in private
or not at all.

1:29:22.124 --> 1:29:24.159
Well,

1:29:24.292 --> 1:29:27.062
I'll answer your question
out of sheer weariness,

1:29:28.997 --> 1:29:31.634
but I truly don't know
what I'm about to say.

1:29:35.137 --> 1:29:39.207
There is a particular
sad beauty

1:29:39.341 --> 1:29:41.343
well-known to
the companionless
foreigner

1:29:41.477 --> 1:29:43.378
as he walks
the streets
of his adopted,

1:29:43.512 --> 1:29:47.115
preferably moonlit,
city. In my case,
Ennui, France.

1:29:48.150 --> 1:29:50.519
I have so often...

1:29:50.653 --> 1:29:54.189
I have so often shared
the day's glittering
discoveries with

1:29:56.892 --> 1:29:58.861
no one at all.

1:29:58.994 --> 1:30:02.064
But always, somewhere along
the avenue or the boulevard,

1:30:02.197 --> 1:30:04.867
there was a table
set for me.

1:30:06.068 --> 1:30:10.105
A cook, a waiter, a bottle,
a glass, a fire.

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:14.309
I chose this life.

1:30:16.344 --> 1:30:20.082
It is the solitary feast
that has been very much
like a comrade,

1:30:20.215 --> 1:30:22.951
my great comfort
and fortification.

1:30:24.887 --> 1:30:28.223
TALK SHOW HOST:
Do you remember where
you placed the bookmark?

1:30:28.356 --> 1:30:30.859
Of course, silly goose.
"Meanwhile."

1:30:30.993 --> 1:30:33.361
"Meanwhile,
across the street..."

1:31:26.248 --> 1:31:29.618
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

1:31:38.561 --> 1:31:41.029
During a lull
in the skirmish,
an ancient concierge,

1:31:41.163 --> 1:31:43.431
veteran of two wars,
limped across the street

1:31:43.566 --> 1:31:45.500
to deliver
an enigmatic message.

1:31:58.847 --> 1:32:02.551
I'm speaking to the leader
of the gang of kidnappers
on the top floor.

1:32:02.685 --> 1:32:05.220
Do you have a working
kitchen in your lair?

1:32:05.353 --> 1:32:07.055
My son needs a snack.

1:32:07.189 --> 1:32:09.692
Allow us to send in
our precinct cook

1:32:09.825 --> 1:32:12.060
along with some supplies
and provisions.

1:32:12.194 --> 1:32:14.730
He will prepare a supper
of sufficient proportions

1:32:14.863 --> 1:32:17.432
to feed you
and all your accomplices.

1:32:18.366 --> 1:32:19.902
We already ate.

1:32:26.541 --> 1:32:28.510
THE CHAUFFEUR:
Is it an underling

1:32:28.644 --> 1:32:30.679
or Nescaffier himself?

1:32:58.674 --> 1:33:00.375
Blackbird pie.

1:33:12.788 --> 1:33:15.457
Required, of course,
to sample each item,

1:33:15.590 --> 1:33:18.460
the chef ate
the deathly poison.

1:33:24.066 --> 1:33:25.801
For the little boy.

1:33:27.670 --> 1:33:28.871
Stop.

1:33:30.773 --> 1:33:32.407
Write down the recipe.

1:33:44.119 --> 1:33:45.253
Help...

1:33:48.423 --> 1:33:50.058
ROEBUCK:
But Nescaffier survived,

1:33:50.192 --> 1:33:52.160
thanks to
the extreme fortitude,

1:33:52.294 --> 1:33:54.462
bolstered and braced,
season upon season,

1:33:54.596 --> 1:33:56.464
by the richest,
most potent plates,

1:33:56.598 --> 1:33:58.266
pans, and sauce pots

1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:01.436
of his almost
superhuman stomach.

1:34:02.604 --> 1:34:04.039
He knew well, of course,

1:34:04.172 --> 1:34:07.275
Gigi loathed and despised
the radish in all its forms

1:34:07.409 --> 1:34:09.344
with a deep,
unbridled passion,

1:34:09.477 --> 1:34:11.213
and had never
so much as touched one

1:34:11.346 --> 1:34:12.514
or even spoken the word,

1:34:12.647 --> 1:34:15.217
during his entire
young lifetime.

1:34:15.350 --> 1:34:17.219
However, as it happened,

1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:20.789
the chauffeur
hated radishes, too.

1:36:25.647 --> 1:36:27.015
Take the wheel!

1:36:51.039 --> 1:36:53.241
Perhaps the most
stirring and startling
phenomenon

1:36:53.375 --> 1:36:57.012
witnessed over the trajectory
of that protracted dinner date
was this...

1:37:09.657 --> 1:37:11.393
A delicious irony.

1:37:11.526 --> 1:37:14.196
Monsieur Albert,
accountant to the demi-monde

1:37:14.329 --> 1:37:17.165
and remote cause of the entire
spectacular contretemps,

1:37:17.299 --> 1:37:18.800
had been forgotten
in the chicken coop

1:37:18.934 --> 1:37:20.635
from Thursday dinner
to Monday breakfast

1:37:20.768 --> 1:37:23.338
and had very nearly
starved in his cell.

1:37:23.471 --> 1:37:25.807
It was only the convalescent
Monsieur Nescaffier himself

1:37:25.941 --> 1:37:27.242
who retained
the presence of mind

1:37:27.375 --> 1:37:29.677
to prepare the prisoner
an omelette a la policier,

1:37:29.811 --> 1:37:30.979
which he delivered warm,

1:37:31.113 --> 1:37:33.348
wrapped in a day-old
search warrant.

1:37:35.183 --> 1:37:37.319
The Abacus ate well
that morning.

1:37:40.322 --> 1:37:42.490
A word from
Gemini tooth powder.

1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:47.495
It was supposed to be
an article about
a great chef.

1:37:47.629 --> 1:37:48.630
It is in part.

1:37:48.763 --> 1:37:50.232
For the Tastes
and Smells section...

1:37:50.365 --> 1:37:52.968
I understand.
The assignment was
perfectly clear.

1:37:53.936 --> 1:37:56.638
Perhaps,
you fail to grasp

1:37:56.771 --> 1:38:00.108
that I was shot at
and hand-grenaded
against my will.

1:38:00.842 --> 1:38:02.244
I only asked to be fed,

1:38:02.377 --> 1:38:05.380
and was, marvelously,
as I described
in some detail.

1:38:05.513 --> 1:38:08.183
Nescaffier only gets
one line of dialogue.

1:38:10.652 --> 1:38:15.357
Well, I did cut something
he told me.
It made me too sad.

1:38:15.490 --> 1:38:17.192
I could stick it
back in, if you like.

1:38:18.860 --> 1:38:20.795
What did he say?

1:38:40.648 --> 1:38:42.917
Martin... Martin...

1:38:43.051 --> 1:38:44.286
Guillaume Martin.

1:38:54.429 --> 1:38:56.131
They had a flavor.

1:38:58.100 --> 1:38:59.601
I beg your pardon?

1:39:01.036 --> 1:39:05.207
The toxic salts
in the radishes...

1:39:05.340 --> 1:39:06.908
they had a flavor.

1:39:07.976 --> 1:39:11.246
Totally unfamiliar to me.

1:39:11.379 --> 1:39:15.583
Like a bitter,
moldy, peppery,

1:39:16.451 --> 1:39:19.321
spicy, oily kind of

1:39:20.488 --> 1:39:22.590
earth.

1:39:22.724 --> 1:39:25.493
I never tasted
that taste in my life.

1:39:26.428 --> 1:39:28.330
Not entirely pleasant,

1:39:28.997 --> 1:39:31.299
extremely poisonous,

1:39:31.433 --> 1:39:33.935
but still, a new flavor.

1:39:35.003 --> 1:39:37.305
That's a rare thing
at my age.

1:39:39.474 --> 1:39:41.976
I admire your bravery,
Lieutenant.

1:39:42.610 --> 1:39:44.512
I'm not brave.

1:39:45.213 --> 1:39:46.848
I just wasn't

1:39:46.981 --> 1:39:48.816
in the mood to be

1:39:48.950 --> 1:39:50.985
a disappointment
to everybody.

1:39:52.820 --> 1:39:54.456
I'm a foreigner, you know.

1:39:55.890 --> 1:39:58.093
This city is full
of us, isn't it?

1:39:59.127 --> 1:40:00.962
I'm one myself.

1:40:03.098 --> 1:40:05.167
Seeking something missing.

1:40:07.102 --> 1:40:09.437
Missing something
left behind.

1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.709
Maybe with good luck,

1:40:14.842 --> 1:40:17.712
we'll find
what eluded us

1:40:17.845 --> 1:40:20.348
in the places
we once called home.

1:40:29.324 --> 1:40:32.427
That's the best part
of the whole thing.

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:34.896
That's the reason
for it to be written.

1:40:37.132 --> 1:40:39.000
I couldn't agree less.

1:40:41.035 --> 1:40:44.239
Well, anyway,
don't cut it.

1:41:14.035 --> 1:41:15.970
Are we all here?

1:41:16.104 --> 1:41:18.540
I guess you know.
It was a heart attack.

1:41:20.575 --> 1:41:21.643
Excusez-moi.

1:41:34.055 --> 1:41:35.257
No crying.

1:41:42.364 --> 1:41:44.566
Is somebody coming
to take him away?

1:41:44.699 --> 1:41:46.701
There's a strike
at the morgue.

1:41:50.372 --> 1:41:51.473
Who was with him?

1:41:51.606 --> 1:41:52.974
He was alone.

1:41:53.107 --> 1:41:55.210
Reading birthday telegrams.

1:41:55.343 --> 1:41:56.411
Psst.

1:41:57.445 --> 1:42:00.248
Don't light the candles.
He's dead.

1:42:01.349 --> 1:42:02.917
I'll have a slice.

1:42:03.518 --> 1:42:05.653
Me, too.

1:42:05.787 --> 1:42:08.390
We need to draft something.
Who wants it?

1:42:08.523 --> 1:42:09.491
We've got a file.

1:42:09.624 --> 1:42:10.958
I'm working on the art.

1:42:13.895 --> 1:42:15.497
That's him.

1:42:19.634 --> 1:42:21.303
Let's write it together.

1:42:21.436 --> 1:42:24.206
Hmm, write what?
The obituary.

1:42:25.907 --> 1:42:28.710
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.
Born in North Kansas,

1:42:28.843 --> 1:42:32.113
10 miles from the geographical
center of the United States.

1:42:32.247 --> 1:42:33.515
Mother died
when he was five.

1:42:33.648 --> 1:42:36.184
Son of a newspaper publisher,
founder of this magazine.

1:42:36.318 --> 1:42:38.453
The French Dispatch,
previously known
as Picnic.

1:42:38.586 --> 1:42:40.455
A largely unread
Sunday supplement

1:42:40.588 --> 1:42:42.557
to the Liberty,
Kansas Evening Sun.

1:42:42.690 --> 1:42:44.192
It began as a holiday.

1:42:44.326 --> 1:42:45.393
Is that true?

1:42:45.527 --> 1:42:46.628
Sort of.

1:42:49.063 --> 1:42:50.665
What happens next?
