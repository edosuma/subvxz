WEBVTT

00:49.299 --> 00:50.967
Whoa, there!

00:51.551 --> 00:53.511
Pandy and I are playing knights.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.180
I'm Gabby the Bold,

00:55.263 --> 00:58.016
and this is Pandy the Purr-owd.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.100
Huzzah!

00:59.601 --> 01:01.686
That's how knights cheer
when they're excited.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.940
We are knights-in-training
at the cat-tastic…

01:06.733 --> 01:09.444
Royal Kitty Cat Castle!

01:09.527 --> 01:10.862
Pretty cool, huh?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.906
As knights-in-training,

01:12.989 --> 01:16.743
Pandy and I are to protect the castle
from all kinds of trouble.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.244
Like…

01:18.328 --> 01:21.623
Floyd the Furr-ocious Dragon!

01:21.706 --> 01:23.166
Rargh!

01:23.666 --> 01:26.503
Doesn't he look scary
in his dragon costume?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.171
-Did you hear that?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.465
It's the Dollhouse Delivery. Come on.

01:43.978 --> 01:44.979
Huzzah!

01:45.480 --> 01:48.399
Let's see what we have
in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.737
Whoa!

01:52.821 --> 01:54.322
Look at this!

01:54.405 --> 01:58.493
Our Kitty Cat Surprise Box
looks just like a knight.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.829
I wonder what could be in here.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.372
Let's see.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.544
Look at this!

02:08.628 --> 02:13.675
It has the Kitty Cat Castle
royal seal on it.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.426
Let's see what it is.

02:19.097 --> 02:19.931
Boop.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.474
OK.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.978
It says here…

02:25.061 --> 02:28.898
It's an invitation
to the Royal Knighting Ceremony,

02:29.649 --> 02:33.278
from King Catnip and Queen Kitty Fairy.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.531
Hey, there's something else in here.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.579
Knights-in-training shields!

02:43.079 --> 02:44.581
See the three little kitties?

02:45.081 --> 02:47.625
Each time you perform
an act of knighthood,

02:47.709 --> 02:49.878
one of the kitties gets colored in.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.505
Do you know what this means?

02:52.589 --> 02:56.843
If we can fill in our shields,
we can be knighted by the king and queen.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.013
Do you want to come
on our quest for knighthood?

03:00.555 --> 03:01.890
Huzzah!

03:01.973 --> 03:06.895
Now it's time to get tiny,
brave knights-in-training.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.030
Whee!

03:17.530 --> 03:20.116
I'm right here, outside of the castle.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.034
Come on.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.705
It's time to get
our knightly training started.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.165
Pandy?

03:27.790 --> 03:30.335
Hmm. Do you see Pandy anywhere?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.297
-Hug attack!

03:34.881 --> 03:36.007
Huzzah!

03:36.090 --> 03:38.092
Pandy!

03:38.176 --> 03:39.177
Hey!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.847
It's Pandy the Purr-owd, remember?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.057
Oh, that's right.

03:44.557 --> 03:48.061
Come on, fellow knights-in-training.
Let's get inside that castle.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.562
Help!

03:50.063 --> 03:53.608
Look!
Someone locked King Catnip in the tower!

03:53.691 --> 03:54.525
Help!

03:54.609 --> 03:59.197
I, King Catnip,
have been trapped up here in this tower!

04:00.240 --> 04:04.160
Gabby the Bold and Pandy the Purr-owd,
thank goodness you're here.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.329
What's going on, Queen Kitty Fairy?

04:06.412 --> 04:10.416
King Catnip is locked in the high tower,
and someone has taken the key.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.628
Without that key,
he'll be trapped in there forever!

04:13.711 --> 04:17.590
Not to worry, Queen Kitty Fairy.
We are brave knights-in-training.

04:17.674 --> 04:20.093
We'll figure out
a way to free King Catnip.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.010
Huzzah!

04:21.094 --> 04:24.389
I certainly hope so,
because if we can't free the king,

04:24.472 --> 04:26.808
we'll have to cancel
the Royal Knighting Ceremony.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.228
-Cancel the Knighting Ceremony?

04:30.311 --> 04:32.981
Hmm. There's got to be a way
to figure this out.

04:33.064 --> 04:36.734
Maybe MerCat the Magical
has a potion that could help us.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.194
That's a great idea!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.405
MerCat has all kinds of potions.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.241
I'm sure she'll have something
to unlock that tower door.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.951
Oh, flower-riffic!

04:45.034 --> 04:46.911
I knew I could count on you two.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.289
I'll go tell King Catnip the good news.

04:51.916 --> 04:58.548
So, Gabby the Bold and Pandy the Purr-owd
think they can rescue the king, eh?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.883
Well, not if I can help it.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.012
You know, I'm a knight-in-training too.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.096
See?

05:05.179 --> 05:08.891
But did I get an invitation
to the Royal Knighting Ceremony?

05:10.476 --> 05:11.811
No!

05:11.894 --> 05:15.273
I guess they think old CatRat's
not good enough to be a real knight.

05:15.940 --> 05:16.774
Hmph!

05:16.858 --> 05:19.861
Well, with King Catnip locked up,

05:19.944 --> 05:22.363
there won't be any ceremony.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.240
Huzzah!

05:24.782 --> 05:27.618
-Hey, wait! The drawbridge!

05:28.494 --> 05:29.954
Oh, no!

05:30.038 --> 05:32.373
How are we gonna get to the castle now?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.876
We need the bridge to cross this moat.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.837
I don't know… yet.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.923
Maybe there's another way
to cross the moat.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.468
Oh! A-ha!

05:44.844 --> 05:47.138
If we had something long and skinny,

05:47.221 --> 05:49.849
we could pole-vault
over to the other side of the moat.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.559
Easy-peasy!

05:52.143 --> 05:54.854
Except… we don't have a pole.

05:55.563 --> 05:59.025
Let's look for something long
and skinny we can use instead.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.026
Come on.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.820
Hmm.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.073
Do you see anything long and skinny?

06:08.826 --> 06:09.827
The pencil.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.541
Yeah, that will work.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.711
OK.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.755
-Ready?
-Ready.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.132
Hang on!

06:24.425 --> 06:25.927
Whee!

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
-Huzzah!
-Huzzah!

06:29.180 --> 06:31.307
That was a-meow-zing!

06:31.390 --> 06:33.851
Talk about a purr-fect landing.

06:37.438 --> 06:40.566
-Come on in, Royal Hamster Kitties.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.745
Whoa!

06:52.829 --> 06:53.663
Check it out.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.499
Part of our shield is filling in.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.293
We completed our first act of knighthood.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.338
We overcame an obstacle
when we got over the moat.

07:02.421 --> 07:03.506
This is paw-esome!

07:03.589 --> 07:07.343
Two more knightly acts
and our shields will be all filled in.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.053
Huzzah!

07:13.015 --> 07:15.309
They made it over the moat. Rats!

07:16.018 --> 07:18.896
I better go see about MerCat the Magical.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.653
MerCat the Magical, are you in here?

07:25.736 --> 07:26.737
I'm up here.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.533
MerCat, this is no time for a bubble bath.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.577
I'm not taking a bubble bath.

07:32.660 --> 07:35.288
CatRat trapped me
in this super-strong bubble and…

07:36.080 --> 07:37.165
now I can't get out.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.085
Hang on, MerCat.
We're gonna pop this bubble.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.131
Hug attack!

07:48.885 --> 07:51.554
Boy, that's one tough bubble.

07:51.637 --> 07:56.601
That's because it's a magic bubble
and can only be popped by magic.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.896
My Bubble-Trouble-Burster Potion
would work,

07:59.979 --> 08:04.358
but to make it, I'm gonna need your help
mixing some potions together.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.235
Fear not, MerCat the Magical.

08:06.319 --> 08:10.531
You tell us which potions to mix together,
and we'll whip it up for you.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.033
Purr-fect!

08:12.116 --> 08:15.203
First, we need some of
the Swizzle-Dizzle Potion.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.663
It's in the red and blue striped bottle.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.166
Will you help me find it?

08:21.042 --> 08:24.670
Great. Where is the bottle
with red and blue stripes?

08:27.465 --> 08:28.799
Yeah! There it is.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.176
Ooh! Excellent.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.929
Now, add five drops
into that empty measuring cup.

08:34.138 --> 08:38.142
One, two, three, four, five.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.310
What's next, MerCat?

08:39.393 --> 08:42.480
We need three drops
of my Power-Popper Potion.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.608
It's the blue bottle
with pink polka dots.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.526
I'm on it.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.655
Uh, think you can help me with this one?

08:51.781 --> 08:52.782
Thanks.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.785
Where's the blue bottle
with pink polka dots?

08:58.955 --> 08:59.789
This is it.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.044
One, two, three.

09:05.545 --> 09:11.801
And finally, we just need one drop of
the Knock-Knock Unlock Potion.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.427
Where do you keep that one?

09:13.511 --> 09:15.137
It's on a high shelf.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.391
It's the orange bottle
with the purple squiggly lines.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.436
Where's the orange bottle
with purple squiggly lines?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.942
Got it. Thanks.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.027
Just one drop.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.154
OK, Gabs!

09:32.238 --> 09:34.657
Put your safety goggles on,
bring it over here,

09:34.740 --> 09:36.075
and give it a good stir.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.956
Here we go.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.964
Shimmering seashells!

09:50.047 --> 09:51.048
You did it!

09:51.591 --> 09:54.468
Thank you so much for your help,
knights-in-training.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.553
You're welcome.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.055
Look!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.433
Another section
of our shield is filling in!

10:00.516 --> 10:03.936
We saved MerCat
and performed another act of knighthood,

10:04.020 --> 10:05.813
helping someone in need.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.691
But we still need to rescue King Catnip.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.110
Oh. Something happened to King Catnip?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.863
He's locked in the tower
and no one can find the key.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.740
Oh, no!

10:15.823 --> 10:17.867
That's why we came to you.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.120
Do you have a potion
that can open a locked door?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.247
You bet your whiskers I do.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.583
That Knock-Knock Unlock Potion
you just used

10:25.666 --> 10:27.710
will unlock any door in a poof!

10:27.793 --> 10:28.628
I'll get it.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.798
Hey, where did it go? It was just here.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.301
Huh? That's strange.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.846
A-ha! Is this the potion
you're looking for?

10:39.347 --> 10:42.808
CatRat, did you lock King Catnip
in the tower?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.143
I did.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.936
And you took the key?

10:46.020 --> 10:47.438
Right again.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.023
But why?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.400
You're a knight-in-training too, CatRat.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.528
Knights are supposed to do good deeds,
not bad deeds.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.572
Yeah, well…

10:57.156 --> 11:00.660
I-I guess King Catnip doesn't think
I'm good enough to be a knight.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.995
What? Why do you think that?

11:03.079 --> 11:06.749
Because I didn't get an invitation
to the Royal Knighting Ceremony.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.293
So, with the king locked up,

11:09.377 --> 11:12.838
I guess the ceremony is canceled.

11:12.922 --> 11:13.756
Huzzah!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.425
Wait a furry second.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.969
-What's that stuck to your paw, CatRat?
-Huh?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.348
Oh. Huh.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.642
It's, uh… It's…

11:25.226 --> 11:28.479
an invitation
to the Royal Knighting Ceremony.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.023
I was invited after all!

11:31.107 --> 11:32.191
Wahoo!

11:32.274 --> 11:34.151
-Ah!

11:34.235 --> 11:35.486
The potion!

11:35.569 --> 11:36.862
Oops.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.948
Oh, no. This is terrible.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.410
I don't even think I deserve
to become a real knight now.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.788
I haven't exactly been
a good knight-in-training.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.125
I'm sorry I trapped you
in a bubble, MerCat.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.252
It's OK, CatRat. I forgive you.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.087
What about King Catnip?

11:53.629 --> 11:56.090
I did kind of lock him in the tower,

11:56.173 --> 11:58.801
and now I've spilled all the potion
to get him out.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.052
What about the key?

12:00.136 --> 12:03.305
Yeah. There's still time
to do the right thing, CatRat.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.183
We just need that key
and we can go save the king.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.018
Uh…

12:08.102 --> 12:10.187
Yeah, about that key…

12:10.271 --> 12:13.190
I don't exactly have it, uh… handy.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
What? Where is it?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.736
Well, I didn't want anyone to find it,

12:17.820 --> 12:18.779
so I, uh…

12:22.491 --> 12:24.201
You tossed it out the window?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.328
Yeah.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.874
Oh, no! Look!

12:29.957 --> 12:33.127
-Floyd the Dragon has the key!

12:33.711 --> 12:35.337
Oh. That's not good.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.340
MerCat's right.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.134
We'll never get the key now.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.344
I've ruined it for everybody!

12:43.137 --> 12:46.098
CatRat,
you're a knight-in-training, right?

12:46.182 --> 12:49.226
Well, yeah. I'd like to be.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.438
Well, does a knight just give up
when the going gets tough?

12:53.481 --> 12:56.108
No. A knight never gives up.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.653
A knight sees a challenge
and faces it head on.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.946
But how?

13:01.030 --> 13:04.158
A dragon isn't just gonna let
some knights-in-training stroll up

13:04.241 --> 13:05.659
and take the key back.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.744
You're right.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.455
A dragon wouldn't let us
take the key back,

13:09.538 --> 13:14.376
but he might let another dragon
take the key.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.462
You want to find another dragon?

13:17.713 --> 13:19.423
We're not gonna find one,

13:19.507 --> 13:21.383
we're gonna make one.

13:21.467 --> 13:26.305
We can disguise ourselves as a dragon
so we can sneak up and grab the key.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.682
That's a cat-tastic idea!

13:28.766 --> 13:31.852
Do you think Baby Box would help us
make a dragon disguise?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.812
I think she would love to.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.689
Then that's our plan.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.860
Hey, what's going on?

13:39.944 --> 13:43.322
CatRat, you performed
an act of knighthood.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.448
I did?

13:44.532 --> 13:47.701
You took responsibility
for something you did wrong

13:47.785 --> 13:49.828
and you made a plan to fix it.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.040
That's definitely
a quality of a great knight.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.500
Wow.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.294
Maybe I can still become a real knight.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.464
Let's go see Baby Box about that dragon.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.258
Thanks, MerCat!

14:02.341 --> 14:04.969
Good luck on your quest,
knights-in-training!

14:10.266 --> 14:11.433
There!

14:12.643 --> 14:16.355
These are gonna look craft-y-riffic
hanging at the Knighting Ceremony.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.233
Baby Box, we need your help!

14:19.316 --> 14:21.735
Hello, there, knights-in-training.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.112
What's going on?

14:23.195 --> 14:25.573
King Catnip's trapped in the tower

14:25.656 --> 14:29.034
and the key to save him is in the clutches
of a furr-ocious dragon.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.037
How did that happen?

14:32.621 --> 14:34.498
Uh, it's a long story.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.292
We need to make a dragon disguise

14:36.375 --> 14:38.919
so we can sneak up to it
and get the key back.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.796
Say no more.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.258
I can help you make
the best dragon disguise ever.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.387
We'll start with some big boxes
for the body and head,

14:48.470 --> 14:50.180
then add some whiskers,

14:50.264 --> 14:51.765
the eyes,

14:51.849 --> 14:53.559
some cute little horns,

14:54.101 --> 14:55.853
and some big dragon wings.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.397
Ooh! Can't forget the wheels.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.524
And done.

15:01.025 --> 15:05.571
You could all fit inside this disguise
and ride right up to the dragon.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.656
He'll think you're a dragon friend.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.491
It's purr-fect!

15:09.575 --> 15:12.453
Well, then let's get crafting.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.385
-Our shields!
-We performed another act of knighthood.

16:09.468 --> 16:13.013
We all worked together
and built something cat-tastic.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.098
Wow!

16:14.640 --> 16:17.851
You guys are ready
to become real knights now.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.853
You're almost there too, CatRat.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.482
But we've still got to free the king
so we can have the Knighting Ceremony

16:23.565 --> 16:25.192
and become real knights.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.070
Come on! Let's go get that key.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.030
Huzzah!

16:37.413 --> 16:39.832
Look. There's the key!

16:39.915 --> 16:41.583
And there's Floyd the Dragon!

16:42.334 --> 16:43.460
Let's roll.

16:46.797 --> 16:47.631
All right.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.676
It's time to get that key.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.969
I'm ready.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.471
Me too. What's our plan, CatRat?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.598
I've got to do this part on my own.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.310
I got us into this mess,
and I'm gonna get us out.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.069
A-ha! Mm-mm.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.447
-Yay! Wahoo!

17:21.040 --> 17:22.791
-Whoa!

17:24.460 --> 17:25.794
Whoa!

17:26.503 --> 17:27.838
Wah-ha-ha!

17:34.762 --> 17:37.973
You did it, CatRat!
You got the key!

17:41.185 --> 17:42.394
Ooh! My shield!

17:42.478 --> 17:46.899
You just performed the knightly act
of bravery, getting that key back.

17:46.982 --> 17:50.277
Yeah! That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.404
Aww. Thanks, guys.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.198
Huzzah!

17:54.281 --> 17:57.785
Uh, guys, great job
on the key and all, but, uh…

17:57.868 --> 18:00.287
can somebody let me out of this tower now?

18:00.370 --> 18:03.207
We're coming, King.

18:21.475 --> 18:25.896
Knights-in-training,
thank you for setting me free.

18:25.979 --> 18:29.566
You have each completed
three acts of knighthood.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.360
You have proven you are worthy

18:31.443 --> 18:34.571
to become true Knights
of the Kitty Cat Castle.

18:34.655 --> 18:39.034
Now, let the Royal
Knighting Ceremony begin!

18:41.620 --> 18:43.080
For your acts of knighthood,

18:43.163 --> 18:45.958
King Catnip and I are honored to dub thee…

18:47.501 --> 18:48.961
Gabby the Bold.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.296
Pandy the Purr-owd.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.799
And CatRat the Brave.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.136
CatRat the Brave?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.346
That's the coolest knight name ever!

18:59.429 --> 19:02.599
Rise, Knights of the Kitty Cat Castle.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.351
-Hooray! Wahoo!
-Great job, knights!

19:04.434 --> 19:05.853
Huzzah!

19:06.436 --> 19:07.646
Can you believe it?

19:07.729 --> 19:10.357
We're real Knights
of the Kitty Cat Castle.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.861
But there's still
one more surprise for you.

19:13.944 --> 19:14.778
Ready?

19:27.541 --> 19:30.002
Gabby Cat of the Day!

19:30.794 --> 19:32.296
It's me, Pandy.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.467
Now that you're a Knight
of the Kitty Cat Castle too…

19:38.844 --> 19:41.096
you need your very own royal shield.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.141
Do you want me to show you
how to make one?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.685
Paw-tastic!

19:46.768 --> 19:48.145
OK.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.980
The first things we need are…

19:52.858 --> 19:55.944
-…some sturdy cardboard…

19:56.028 --> 19:58.488
-…some royal tape…

19:58.572 --> 20:02.159
-…and a bold crayon.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.206
Thank you, Royal Hamster Kitties.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.666
First, we need to make the handle.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.086
Use a strip of cardboard
and tape it down on each side.

20:15.964 --> 20:16.798
There.

20:17.299 --> 20:22.471
Now… use your crayon
to draw your big cat head shield design.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.598
Like this.

20:25.140 --> 20:29.186
On the inside, you make a big,
upside-down V at the bottom

20:29.269 --> 20:31.313
and a line connecting it to the top.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.190
Now you have your three sections.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.609
That's where the Royal Kitties go.

20:35.692 --> 20:38.320
One Royal Kitty, with two eyes,

20:38.403 --> 20:40.656
a nose, and a nice royal smile.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.617
One Royal Kitty in this section.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.788
And one more…

20:48.914 --> 20:50.290
right here.

20:50.832 --> 20:51.959
Huzzah!

20:52.042 --> 20:54.169
Now it's time for my favorite part.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.007
The royal glue!

21:01.843 --> 21:04.846
We need to cover
all the crayon lines with glue.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.310
Easy-peasy, glue so squeezy!

21:11.979 --> 21:13.105
Ooh!

21:13.188 --> 21:14.815
Two drops for the eyes,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.149
the royal smile,

21:16.233 --> 21:17.317
and there.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.695
Now we wait for the glue to dry.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.323
It's dry.

21:23.407 --> 21:27.786
So, to make it look totally paw-tastic,
we need…

21:30.122 --> 21:32.791
-…the royal tinfoil…

21:32.874 --> 21:35.419
-…the majestic markers…

21:35.502 --> 21:38.714
-…and the royal cotton swab!

21:39.589 --> 21:43.260
Place the tinfoil over the cardboard
and wrap it around the edges.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.681
Ready to see the royal swab in action?

21:47.764 --> 21:48.932
Watch this.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.477
When you rub around all the glue lines,

21:53.186 --> 21:55.022
the design comes out on the foil.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.610
Pretty cool, huh?

22:01.611 --> 22:04.072
Now, each time you complete
an act of knighthood,

22:04.698 --> 22:06.533
you can color in one of your kitties.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.329
Check it out!

22:13.623 --> 22:14.958
And… there.

22:15.751 --> 22:16.752
Huzzah!

22:17.502 --> 22:18.754
Royal paw bump?

22:20.380 --> 22:21.548
See you next time.

22:23.091 --> 22:27.387
I'm so glad to be an official knight
at the Kitty Cat Castle.

22:28.388 --> 22:32.184
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:32.267 --> 22:35.979
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a dragon to snuggle with.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.439
-Aww!

22:38.774 --> 22:39.941
See you later.
