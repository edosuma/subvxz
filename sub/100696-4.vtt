09:48.713 --> 09:49.964
[Kenya] <i>I mean, yeah.</i>

09:50.047 --> 09:52.383
Could I be more hands-on
like Jo is with the kids?

09:52.466 --> 09:53.301
Sure.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.761
But I can't
because I actually have to work.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.013
A real job.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.055
[people yelling] 

09:58.139 --> 10:00.266
[woman] Oh, my God. Okay. He got it.

10:00.349 --> 10:04.562
-[man] 156. 157. 158. 159.
-Not gonna make it. Not gonna do it.

10:04.645 --> 10:05.896
-Nope. No.
-[man] Two minutes!

10:05.980 --> 10:07.064
[all cheering]

10:07.148 --> 10:08.065
Pay me!

10:08.149 --> 10:10.109
Pay me! I want it in cash.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.613
Go to the ATM.  Get it. I don't care!
I don't want to hear shit. I want money.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.739
Better pay. 

10:14.864 --> 10:16.699
-Yeah.
-[man] What did he say it was?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.534
[woman] That was so stressful.

10:18.868 --> 10:19.952
[mouthing]

10:21.829 --> 10:25.458
Don't look at me like that
with your judgment and your jug of water.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.669
You know that water is more expensive
than gas per gallon?

10:29.712 --> 10:33.549
I bought that with sticking my head
into water...

10:34.091 --> 10:35.009
buckets.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.970
And you sit there looking at me
full of judgment.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.598
Life's got a real lesson to teach you.

10:42.141 --> 10:46.103
Okay, guys, let's do what we do
as professional writers

10:46.187 --> 10:48.189
and go to work.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.816
We're working like we do.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.152
It's characters and dynamics,
that's what we do, guys.

10:53.235 --> 10:56.656
This is a professional writer's room
where we just do characters and dynamics.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.615
What?

10:57.698 --> 10:59.992
I would love to talk
about characters and dynamics.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.203
[Kenya] That's great, Leeza,
that's what we do all the time.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.039
-What?
-Guys, guys,  guys...

11:05.122 --> 11:07.792
my kid is here, it's just, like,
a documentary, it's a thing.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.378
Can we please, I swear to God--
Can we please, just for a second--

11:10.461 --> 11:13.172
They have a-- I don't want to be
on camera, and why is this our--

11:13.255 --> 11:15.174
I will call your agent so fast.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.093
You are a diversity hire.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.387
-[chortling]
-Oh, my God. 

11:19.470 --> 11:21.555
Okay, I would actually
like to take this moment,

11:21.639 --> 11:23.140
if we're really gonna work,
I'd love to work.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.142
-That would be amazing.
-We always work.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.311
-I think we should go over--
-[Joya] Hey!

11:27.395 --> 11:28.771
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.648
Oh, my fucking God, dude.
You gotta be kidding me.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.858
We just wanted to bring some food
for lunch

11:32.942 --> 11:34.485
-and celebrate the new season.
-[man] What?

11:34.568 --> 11:36.320
You can just put it over there. Thank you.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.488
Gotta be fucking kidding.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.740
-I got you some Roscoe's.
-Roscoe's!

11:39.824 --> 11:42.410
Chicken and waffles, yep.
It's for everybody now.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.787
-Thank you.
-Just to celebrate the new season.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.163
[Leeeza] We love it!

11:46.247 --> 11:48.290
[scoffs] Dude, that's not why she came.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.835
She never just does stuff
to be doing it to be nice.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.462
This was a classic dad-type check.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.089
-A what?
-A dad--

11:55.673 --> 11:58.050
She wanted to see what was in the room.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.219
I know what she was up to.

12:00.302 --> 12:03.556
I'm Joya, by the way.
I'm Kenya's wife.

12:03.639 --> 12:05.808
-Hi, Joya.
-[Joya] Very nice to meet you.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.309
And this is Brooklyn.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.396
Say hi to Daddy!
This is our youngest of six.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.898
-Six. We got six kids.
-Six? [exhales] 

12:12.982 --> 12:15.192
-You do not have six children.
-I do. I do. 

12:15.276 --> 12:17.778
-It's crazy, right? It's so crazy.
-It's nothing crazy.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.155
I mean, people come back.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.408
Yeah. So many new faces.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
-[man] Yeah.
-[Kenya] Yeah. There is. There is.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.162
-Lots of new faces. Um...
-[Joya] Mm-hmm.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.665
That's sort of my subtle way of telling
you I want to be introduced, so...

12:29.749 --> 12:31.208
Okay. Uh...

12:31.542 --> 12:34.754
You know Jerome,
or maybe you haven't met Jerome. Nelson.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.714
-'Kayla. Leeza.
-Hi.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.216
-You know, of course--
-I didn't get your name.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.760
-It's Mikayla.
-[Joya] Mikayla.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.678
-[Mikayla] Yeah.
-Nice to meet you. [chuckles] 

12:43.304 --> 12:46.015
I see through her.
See right through her.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.267
And you, of course, know Broadway.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.728
-Yes. Yes, I do.
-[Broadway chuckles] 

12:50.811 --> 12:52.062
Broadway.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.065
If it wasn't for gay sex, I'd be gay.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.484
For real.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.445
I mean,
my dude would probably be hella in shape,

12:59.528 --> 13:01.781
hella fun, hella rich. [chuckles] 

13:01.864 --> 13:05.159
We'd probably play catch
and <i>Madden </i>and shit. [chuckles] 

13:05.242 --> 13:07.328
I'm telling you,
gay niggas have a better life.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.414
If it wasn't for smashing other dudes.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.624
[clicks tongue] 

13:11.707 --> 13:14.752
Okay, Broadway, cool.
Well, nice to see you, as always.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.213
Let's go eat something, okay?

13:17.296 --> 13:19.715
Rawr! Rawr!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.008
-Okay.
-[Brooklyn] I'm not hungry.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.343
Well, we're gonna eat anyway.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.845
Yeah, that's the introductions.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.014
It's really nice to meet all of you.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.183
I mean, it's crazy
that he even remembers your names,

13:29.266 --> 13:31.769
like, he can't remember
our kids' birthdays. [chuckling]

13:31.852 --> 13:32.728
[all laughing]

13:32.812 --> 13:34.897
-[Leeza] That tracks.
-[Joya] Yeah. Yeah. 

13:34.980 --> 13:36.899
-[Jerome] I don't blame him with six kids.
-Not--

13:36.982 --> 13:38.984
-[Joya lauging] Yeah.
-That's very funny.

13:39.068 --> 13:43.030
-Well, thank you so much for great jokes.
-Okay. Come on, boo boo. Let's go.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.406
And bringing my child here.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.825
-I appreciate you.
-Really good to meet you. 

13:45.908 --> 13:48.327
Especially you, Mikayla.
Great to meet you. Yeah.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.787
[Joya chuckles] 

13:49.870 --> 13:52.206
We're gonna go now.
Give Daddy back his phone.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.166
-You don't know what's on there! Okay.
-[scattered laughter] 

13:54.250 --> 13:56.377
All right, bye! See you!

13:56.460 --> 13:57.837
-[Mikayla] Bye, Brooklyn!
-[Broadway] See ya!

13:57.920 --> 13:58.838
[Jerome] Bye, Brooklyn!

13:59.380 --> 14:01.215
-She is fantastic.
-Yeah.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.177
-Is she?
-Yeah, definitely. Your wife is a queen.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.095
Yeah.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.889
And her snap-back game
is Angela Bassett-esque.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.140
What?

14:10.224 --> 14:13.477
I'm just saying, she's like
a caramel rubber band, you know?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.729
-Stop while you're ahead.
-What the fuck is happening right now?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
I'm hearing myself say it,
it sounds inappropriate.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.858
I meant to say was that

14:18.941 --> 14:21.068
she's a beautiful woman
and she's an amazing mother.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.362
Why is she an amazing mother?

14:23.654 --> 14:26.073
Because she brings us some soggy waffles

14:26.156 --> 14:28.701
that probably should not travel,
and fried chicken?

14:28.784 --> 14:32.079
Or because she takes her three-year-old
son who can't fend for himself

14:32.162 --> 14:35.082
and she'd go to jail if she left him
at home to wherever she's going?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.043
But she is amazing.
I'm not saying she's not.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.462
All I'm saying is,
isn't it kinda weird that

14:40.880 --> 14:44.884
literally, you almost never hear someone
say someone's an amazing black dad?

14:44.967 --> 14:45.801
[Broadway] Hm!

14:45.885 --> 14:48.178
You hear it with the mom, but you almost
never hear it with a black man.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.847
If I ask you right now,

14:49.930 --> 14:51.515
name an amazing black dad.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.142
Uh...

14:53.267 --> 14:55.060
-Cosby.
-No. No.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.397
But if I asked you to name
an amazing black mom.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.316
Then I would say Michelle Obama. Hello?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.067
-Beyoncé.
-I love Serena Williams too.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.528
-She's always posting about her baby.
-And Jada Pinkett Smith.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.197
Jada Pinkett Smith. And her mom, too.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.866
-Maya Angelou is good too.
-Moms Mabley. 

15:09.658 --> 15:12.453
-Moms Mabley, she has "Moms" in her name.
-[Kenya] All good examples except that.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.623
But yes, she probably was,
you know, actually, to be fair.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.918
My point being is,
don't you think it's weird how

15:19.001 --> 15:20.210
in the streets,

15:20.294 --> 15:23.130
the black moms' fucking rep
is like Marvel-superhero level.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.799
They might as well walk around
with capes on. They can do no wrong,

15:25.883 --> 15:29.219
but black dads in the street,
our shit is trash.

15:29.678 --> 15:30.638
Trash.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.431
[Broadway] That's for real. Seriously.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.059
I mean, black dads
are like the Hitlers of dads.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.478
-No offense, sir.
-Could you not call me "sir?"

15:37.561 --> 15:38.812
Just as a rule.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.732
Also, why would you assume that
I'd be offended by you mentioning Hitler?

15:41.815 --> 15:43.108
You think I'm a Nazi sympathizer?

15:43.192 --> 15:45.569
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down, sir!
-[Jerome] Is that it? Is that--

15:45.694 --> 15:47.780
-[sighs]
-This is what I was trying to avoid.

15:47.863 --> 15:48.906
To be fair, it's weird.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.700
-I told you about this.
-[Kenya] I can see it now.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.037
Okay. Look, I'm just saying this,
it's not like you don't get love, okay?

15:55.120 --> 15:58.290
There's people always praising you
about being such a great writer.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.377
And for Joya, you know,
she gets praised for being a mom.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.089
She gets a lot of love
for being a lawyer too. Like, a lot.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.049
I feel like, why can't it go both ways?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.635
Why can't I get praised
for being a great writer,

16:09.718 --> 16:11.929
and I also have six kids.

16:12.012 --> 16:15.432
She didn't do that by herself.
So, why can't we get both?

16:15.516 --> 16:16.809
-They should.
-Oh, my God.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.312
-Okay, Leeza. What?
-What?

16:20.396 --> 16:22.064
Seems like you're about
to have an aneurysm.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.608
-Say what you gotta say.
-I wasn't going to say anything,

16:24.692 --> 16:27.236
it's just a little ridiculous to me
that you're trying to equate this

16:27.319 --> 16:29.488
because-- Anyway, I'm sorry.
It's just that,

16:29.571 --> 16:33.742
you know, when Dan takes the kids
to the park once a week, once,

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
everyone's like, "Oh, how amazing."

16:35.744 --> 16:39.248
You know? And then I'm here
with you people all day.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.708
-What?
-Oh, okay.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.127
That was not a racist thing to say.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.714
This job is hard, and then I go home
and I'm cooking dinner,

16:46.797 --> 16:48.632
and I do bath-time and story-time,

16:48.716 --> 16:50.259
and then, and, and--

16:50.342 --> 16:52.970
I take the kids to the park
and I fall asleep

16:53.053 --> 16:55.556
one time. One time!

16:55.639 --> 16:58.684
Because I took a really small hit
on my, you know, 

16:58.767 --> 17:01.603
medically prescribed "bliss:dosist" pen,

17:01.687 --> 17:04.690
which Dr. Chimchor said
I need for my anxiety, so...

17:05.232 --> 17:07.526
And the next thing I know,
I'm being questioned

17:07.609 --> 17:11.655
by fucking Hispanic and Asian cops
for 35 minutes.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.699
"Are you okay? Where are your children?"

17:13.782 --> 17:15.159
Like I'm a bad mom,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.327
and I was like,
"You know what? Fuck you."

17:21.665 --> 17:22.499
[Kenya] Wow.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.085
That story had so much--

17:25.169 --> 17:26.253
Did you get...

17:26.503 --> 17:27.546
Every single word.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.757
I don't even really know where to start.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.719
Uh, I think maybe we can start
with why it was necessary

17:33.802 --> 17:36.180
to disclose the races of the officers.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.723
I'm painting a picture.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.016
My point is

17:39.266 --> 17:43.187
that I think that dads are celebrated
for doing ten percent

17:43.437 --> 17:46.231
of the stuff
that moms are just expected to do.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.109
You know, I think that is probably true
about white fathers,

17:49.193 --> 17:52.446
but I don't think the black fathers
get the same presumption of goodness.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.156
-Oh, my God.
-Amen.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.783
Wait, "amen?"

17:56.241 --> 17:59.036
You're not a father.
You're just a nigga who needs a vasectomy.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.996
-[laughing]
-Ooh.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.122
Hilarious.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.916
[Nelson continues laughing]

18:04.041 --> 18:05.084
Nelson.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.504
Even though sometimes he be dropping
hellified black facts,

18:09.088 --> 18:10.923
I don't really mess with dude like that.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.216
[Drea] How come?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.760
