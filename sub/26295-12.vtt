WEBVTT

00:07.442 --> 00:08.486
- Touching down at Med
in eight minutes.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.532
- Sounds good.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.626
- Hey, Daniel.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.323
- What's up?

00:19.367 --> 00:20.803
- How was your weekend?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.718
- I actually went out
on a date.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.633
- Nice!

00:24.676 --> 00:27.288
With that guy you met at that--
the jazz club? At Andy's?

00:27.331 --> 00:29.290
- Nope, I met him online.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.508
- Online?

00:30.552 --> 00:33.207
- I thought I'd give it a shot.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.297
- Wow.
I don't know, man.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.603
Placing the deepest core
of my innermost self

00:38.647 --> 00:40.518
in the hands of an algorithm?

00:40.562 --> 00:42.216
Not sure I'm there yet.

00:42.259 --> 00:45.175
- Well, where else
am I gonna meet anybody?

00:45.219 --> 00:46.655
- Are you gonna go out
with him again?

00:46.698 --> 00:49.484
- Uh-uh,
but I'm gonna keep trying.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.099
- NICU wants to know
how he's looking.

00:56.143 --> 01:00.190
- Uh, he's tolerating the ECMO
and his vitals are good.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.105
- All right, we'll be there
in about two minutes.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.588
- What's going on?
- Power's gone.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.198
- What do you mean
the power's gone?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.722
- We lost an engine.
We're gonna have to land.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
Brace yourself.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.785
Hold on tight!

01:44.104 --> 01:45.844
- Are you guys okay?

01:45.888 --> 01:47.803
Yeah, uh...

01:47.846 --> 01:49.892
Cody's foot is jammed
and, uh,

01:49.935 --> 01:51.676
I think I dislocated
my shoulder.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.156
You?
- My leg's stuck,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.723
but I'm okay.

01:54.766 --> 01:55.941
You guys just sit tight.
I'm gonna call for help.

01:55.985 --> 01:57.552
- Okay.

01:57.595 --> 02:00.642
- This is November Hotel
6-3-2-0-1.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.687
We've made an emergency landing
in Townsend Quarry.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.167
Looks like we've got
a bent airframe.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.387
We're gonna need assistance
evacuating the aircraft.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.173
- His sats are down to 94.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.001
His oxygenator is not working.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.785
He won't make it
to the hospital.

02:13.829 --> 02:17.441
Call Med--we need to get
a new oxygenator out here fast.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.051
- This is November Hotel--
- Ah!

02:19.095 --> 02:21.880
- Vicki and I just hung around
the apartment, nothing big.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.578
You okay?

02:23.621 --> 02:24.622
- Yeah, I've been crashing
on my brother's couch.

02:24.666 --> 02:25.797
It's like a pile of rocks.

02:25.841 --> 02:26.798
- You're still not back
with Nat?

02:26.842 --> 02:28.365
What's going on?

02:28.409 --> 02:31.063
- Uh, she kicked me out.
You got to ask her.

02:31.107 --> 02:33.065
- Dr. Manning's helicopter
just went down hard

02:33.109 --> 02:34.154
outside of the city.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.720
- Is Natalie hurt?

02:35.764 --> 02:37.069
- Nothing serious,
dislocated shoulder.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.636
The patient's okay,
but they're stuck.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.985
The oxygenator
on the ECMO is damaged.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.422
We need to get a new one
out to her now.

02:41.465 --> 02:42.901
- Okay, Dr. Choi,
grab an ambulance.

02:42.945 --> 02:44.642
- No, I'll go.
- No.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.078
I just put a patient in five.
Let Choi do it.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.428
- No way, I'm going.
- And I'll cover for him.

02:47.471 --> 02:50.170
- Thanks.
- Suit yourself.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.218
- Mr. Green?

02:55.262 --> 02:56.785
Hi, I'm Dr. Choi.

02:56.828 --> 03:00.528
- Yeah, it's Bruce.
This is Carol and Jesse.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.094
- Nice to meet you.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.531
So what seems
to be the problem?

03:03.574 --> 03:05.794
My belly is killing me, man.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.665
- He's been throwing up a lot.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.190
It's getting worse.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.802
- My mouth is dry.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.543
Hey, Jesse,
could you grab my water bottle?

03:17.980 --> 03:18.937
Thanks, bud.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.548
- What happened to you?

03:20.591 --> 03:22.158
- Broke my arm.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.942
- That's a bummer.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.510
You know, I think Monique
might have some cool stickers

03:26.554 --> 03:27.946
to put on your cast.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.470
Want to go take a look?

03:29.513 --> 03:30.688
- Sure.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.516
- Nice.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.826
- I'll run some tests,

03:37.869 --> 03:40.611
but everything I'm seeing
points to liver failure.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.134
Any history of hepatitis?

03:42.178 --> 03:43.788
- No.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.530
- How about alcohol abuse?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.271
- Couple of drinks here
and there.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.620
- How many drinks is a couple?

03:49.664 --> 03:51.448
- I don't know,

03:51.492 --> 03:53.145
two or three
while I'm watching the game.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.973
- Honey--
- Carol, we...

03:58.281 --> 04:00.152
- I'd like to take
some blood and get a CT,

04:00.196 --> 04:02.024
then go from there.

04:02.067 --> 04:05.027
We can discuss this more
once I have the results.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.942
- Okay.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.820
Dr. Choi?

04:15.864 --> 04:18.823
He drinks...
more than he says he does.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.782
It's a problem.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.827
- Look, we'll do everything
we can for him,

04:22.871 --> 04:25.177
but he won't get any better
unless he stops drinking.

04:25.221 --> 04:28.180
- I tried.
Nothing works.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.009
- Let me have one of
our psychiatrists talk to him.

04:31.053 --> 04:33.142
He might be able to help.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.013
Thank you.

04:35.057 --> 04:37.755
- Sure.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.845
- What, no coffee today?

04:40.889 --> 04:42.717
All that vanilla syrup
is going to go to waste.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.807
- What are you going to do?

04:45.850 --> 04:47.722
- Connor, what's going on?

04:47.765 --> 04:49.027
- Nothing.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.551
- Well, it's not nothing.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.118
You've been distant
and aloof for weeks.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.599
Can you please tell me
what's going on?

04:55.643 --> 04:56.992
- There's nothing to tell.
I'm fine.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.776
- Dr. Rhodes, Dr. Bekker,
your patient's here.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.169
We're in Trauma 2.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.692
- Thank you.
- I've got Barbara Duncan,

05:01.736 --> 05:03.955
Down syndrome,
21 weeks pregnant,

05:03.999 --> 05:07.002
passed out and is stable now
on five liters O2.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.133
This is her mother, Kathy.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.221
- Hi.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.788
Hey, Barbara, I'm Dr. Rhodes,

05:10.832 --> 05:11.833
I'm gonna take
good care of you, okay?

05:11.876 --> 05:13.269
- Okay.
- Good.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.272
All right,
let's transfer on my count.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.579
One, two, three!

05:18.622 --> 05:20.798
There we go.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.366
- So what happened?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.194
- I got dizzy.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.717
- She fainted in art class.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.024
This is the second time
this week.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.895
- I have a baby in me.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.070
- Congratulations.

05:32.114 --> 05:34.377
- I'm gonna be a great mom,

05:34.421 --> 05:35.857
just like my mom.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.773
- I am certain that you will.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.732
So I spoke with
Barbara's cardiologist.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.952
He said that she has
a congenital heart defect?

05:43.995 --> 05:45.780
- Tetralogy of Fallot.

05:45.823 --> 05:49.349
It wasn't that severe, so
they decided not to repair it.

05:51.046 --> 05:54.049
- Oh, it's--it's possible
the extra load from pregnancy

05:54.092 --> 05:55.616
is starting to cause
too much strain.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.010
- Well, her lungs are wet.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.795
So, Barbara,

06:00.838 --> 06:03.754
we would like to run some tests
to figure out what's wrong.

06:03.798 --> 06:04.755
Is that okay?

06:04.799 --> 06:05.756
- Sure.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.279
- Good deal.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.369
We will check on you soon.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.198
- Doctor,

06:13.242 --> 06:14.809
is she gonna need surgery?

06:14.852 --> 06:16.201
- It's possible,
but we need to wait

06:16.245 --> 06:18.900
and see her test results first.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.685
- Fine, just let me know
as soon as you can

06:21.729 --> 06:24.253
in case I have to make
arrangements or...

06:24.296 --> 06:25.907
bring in special equipment
to the house.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.039
- Look, I--I know that
this is all a lot,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.128
so is there anybody else
that we can call?

06:30.172 --> 06:31.434
Maybe the baby's father?

06:31.478 --> 06:34.002
- He took off.
It's just the two of us.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.222
Excuse me.

06:50.497 --> 06:54.065
- Ethan, I, uh,
I just talked to the Greens.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.806
- Any luck?

06:55.850 --> 06:57.460
- Well, he doesn't seem
to think he has a problem.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.114
I think the wife's been trying
to get through, but...

06:59.157 --> 07:00.985
- Yeah, but what can she do?

07:01.029 --> 07:02.378
She's a victim in this too.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.641
- Yeah, family dynamics
can be crucial

07:04.685 --> 07:05.990
when it comes
to recovery.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.209
You just don't tend
to get results

07:07.252 --> 07:09.124
by maintaining
the status quo.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.648
In my experience, something
pretty drastic has to happen

07:11.692 --> 07:13.433
to get the drinker to realize
they hit rock bottom

07:13.476 --> 07:14.956
and start looking
for a solution.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.088
- Dr. Charles,
he's got portal hypertension,

07:17.132 --> 07:20.352
esophageal varices,
and LFTs through the roof.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.702
This is rock bottom.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.051
- You'd think.

07:30.406 --> 07:33.801
- Hey, guys, I need to get
this oxygenator down there.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.324
- Oh, it's gonna be a minute.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.847
We gotta get our extrication
equipment down first.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.066
- Natalie's got
a dislocated shoulder

07:38.109 --> 07:39.763
and her patient's in trouble.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.112
- All right, we'll send it
down in the basket.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.027
- No, I'm going too.
- Doc, come on.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.507
We don't even have
our guys down there yet.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.118
- I have to get to Natalie.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.381
Send me down now.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.759
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.632
- How's the boy?
- Sats are down to 82.

08:22.676 --> 08:23.807
- What about your shoulder?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.330
- It's all right.
I'm fine.

08:38.909 --> 08:42.260
- Got it?
- Yeah.

08:51.443 --> 08:52.793
- Wait, stop.
- Ah!

08:52.836 --> 08:53.881
- Let me see if I can
pry open another window.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.578
- I told you I'm fine.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.015
- Natalie, just hold on.
You don't have to be a hero.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.583
- Ow.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.846
- Come on. What, do you want
to damage the nerves?

09:02.890 --> 09:04.892
- I don't need
your medical advice, Will.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.551
- Mr. Flores, can you tell me
how long you've been in pain?

09:11.594 --> 09:13.422
- Uh, just since last night.

09:13.465 --> 09:15.467
Usually her cooking wears off
by the morning.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.426
- Okay.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.428
Have, uh, you ever
had pain like this before?

09:19.471 --> 09:21.299
- Uh, no.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.954
- Any history of abdominal
conditions or surgeries?

09:23.998 --> 09:27.044
- No.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.438
- Okay, based on your
positive McBurney's sign

09:29.481 --> 09:30.918
and rebound tenderness,

09:30.961 --> 09:34.312
I suspect you have a routine
case of appendicitis.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.313
Do you have any allergies?

09:35.357 --> 09:36.924
- Uh, not that I know of.

09:36.967 --> 09:39.622
- Then we're going to order
some tests and call Surgery.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.450
- Surgery?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.756
- If necessary,

09:42.799 --> 09:44.888
an appendectomy is
a very simple procedure.

09:44.932 --> 09:47.543
You'd most likely be out
of the hospital by tomorrow.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.937
- Okay.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.765
Here you go.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.375
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.029
- Um, I like to keep notes
on all my cases.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.032
- Tell radiology
we need a CT

09:58.075 --> 09:59.860
with contrast, stat.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.385
- Nah, keep it.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.517
Turns out people don't hire
a flooring company

10:05.561 --> 10:07.694
'cause you give 'em free pens.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.783
Who knew?

10:09.826 --> 10:11.915
- Yeah,
that does seem unlikely.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.791
- And for the pain?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.488
- I think it's time
to take it back.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.664
Ibuprofen 600.
- Okay.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.970
- Would you excuse me
for a second?

10:23.013 --> 10:25.929
- Of course.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.977
- Oh, yeah, snack time.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.588
- Yeah.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.677
- I would stay away
from those apple slices.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.113
They don't change them out
that much.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.985
- Okay, thanks.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.990
- Whoa, I got you.
I got you.

10:43.033 --> 10:47.472
That's an excellent cast.
What did you do to your arm?

10:47.516 --> 10:49.039
- I broke it.

10:49.083 --> 10:52.129
- What, bear attack?

10:52.173 --> 10:53.696
Motorcycle?

10:53.740 --> 10:57.526
- Oh, it was nothing.
I just--you know, I fell.

10:58.745 --> 10:59.920
From my treehouse.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.144
- Oh, excellent choice.

11:08.929 --> 11:12.715
So, um, what happened?
Uh, what, rainy day?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.848
Rotten plank?

11:14.891 --> 11:18.765
- Oh, I--you know,
I was just playing around.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.985
I got to get back
to my mom and dad.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.566
- So, Barbara,

11:37.609 --> 11:42.049
your tests are showing that
you are in heart failure

11:42.092 --> 11:46.662
and we have every reason
to expect

11:46.706 --> 11:49.578
that it will get worse as
the pregnancy progresses.

11:49.621 --> 11:50.971
- How much worse?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.712
- It's impossible to say,

11:52.755 --> 11:53.843
but the odds of you having
a life-threatening event

11:53.887 --> 11:55.845
are quite high.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.760
- So she needs the surgery.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.066
- That would be
my recommendation, yes,

11:59.109 --> 12:01.764
but you should know,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.071
the surgery is long
and difficult

12:04.114 --> 12:07.465
and it could pose a risk
to the baby.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.076
- It's gonna hurt my baby?

12:09.119 --> 12:10.164
- It's possible.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.906
And, unfortunately if it does,

12:12.949 --> 12:14.821
your baby is too small
to survive on its own.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.779
- He'll die?
- He may.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.781
- No, I don't want the surgery.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.088
- Barbie, I don't think they're
saying that we have a choice.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.698
- Yes, we do.
- Honey--

12:22.742 --> 12:23.830
- You don't want
to take care of this baby.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.483
- Barbara--

12:25.527 --> 12:28.443
- Oh, you think it's going
to be a problem like me.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.097
- I know this is difficult
and painful,

12:30.140 --> 12:31.751
but you have to let me
handle this.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.665
- No, this is my decision!

12:33.709 --> 12:35.842
- You're not capable
of making this decision!

12:41.108 --> 12:44.502
- Look, why don't you two
take some time?

12:44.546 --> 12:48.071
You can think about it and we
will come back in just a bit.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.821
Excuse me.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.216
I have Barbara's medical
power of attorney.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.087
Do the surgery.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.828
- Ms. Duncan, I really think
that the two of you should--

13:05.872 --> 13:09.136
- If she doesn't have
the surgery, she could die.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.922
Do the surgery.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.710
- I'll go put her
on the schedule.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.930
- No, you won't.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.976
- You heard her mother,
she has power of attorney.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.848
- I heard my patient
and she doesn't want it.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.244
- Got it.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.031
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.598
- Hey, Cruz.
- Yeah.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.860
- Help me try
and get this kid out.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.688
- On my way.
- How's Cody doing?

13:39.731 --> 13:40.994
- His sats are improving,

13:41.037 --> 13:43.257
but the battery is running low
on the ECMO.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.041
- Well, looks like they should
have him out soon.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.608
Let me reduce your shoulder.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.262
- No, we'll do it
when we get back.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.220
- We still have to get him out
of here, back to the ambulance,

13:50.264 --> 13:51.221
and all the way to Med.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.136
You're gonna need your arm.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.182
- Fine.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.013
No, I--um,

14:00.056 --> 14:01.666
I think you're a little too
high on the forearm.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.016
- Natalie,
I've done this before.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.800
- Yeah, I know,
but this is the arm that I--

14:04.844 --> 14:06.106
- You broke in college

14:06.149 --> 14:07.107
when Lisa Gates
ran into you with her bike.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.979
I know.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.633
All right,
you're gonna feel this.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.853
Just be still.
- Okay, but I still think--

14:14.941 --> 14:17.073
Ow.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.032
- There, try it out.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.905
It's good.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.907
Thank you.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.778
I'm gonna go check on Cody.

14:30.695 --> 14:33.785
- Dr. Choi?

14:33.829 --> 14:36.136
Is my dad gonna die?

14:41.968 --> 14:44.753
We're doing everything we can
to help him get better.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.277
- So he might?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.280
- Give us a chance.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.674
We still have some things
we can try.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.864
- Doc, that thing for me?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.257
- Once we drain the fluid
from your abdomen,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.259
it'll be easier to breathe.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.870
- And then what happens?

15:14.914 --> 15:17.264
- We'll start you on
a diuretic.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.830
Then have you evaluated

15:18.874 --> 15:21.311
for an intrahepatic
porto-systemic shunt

15:22.747 --> 15:24.706
- That sounds serious.

15:24.749 --> 15:28.840
- It is,
but here's the thing...

15:28.884 --> 15:31.974
If you keep drinking,
none of it will work.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.715
- Come on, Doc,
I told you--

15:33.758 --> 15:36.370
- You'll lose
your mental status first.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.939
Confusion, memory loss.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.724
That's when your kidneys
start to fail.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.379
Your lungs fill with fluid.

15:45.422 --> 15:50.906
Then it's either heart failure,
infection, or coma.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
Probably two,
three months tops.

15:54.127 --> 15:57.130
- Okay, I get it, it's--

15:57.173 --> 15:59.828
it's your job to scare me.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.310
- My job is to try
to keep you alive

16:03.353 --> 16:05.921
and, from what I can tell,
you have a lot to live for.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.144
But it's up to you whether you
want to do that or not.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.018
Let me know when
the drainage stops.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.195
- Bruce.

16:19.239 --> 16:22.024
- Okay, you're right.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.855
Clearly, I drink too much.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.292
She's always telling me that.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.121
Oh, that's it.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.384
I'm done.

16:34.428 --> 16:37.779
- Quitting doesn't mean
just saying it.

16:37.822 --> 16:40.390
It means going through detox,
A.A.

16:40.434 --> 16:45.395
- Doc, I got a boy I love,
my wife.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.097
I am telling you...

16:51.140 --> 16:52.837
I have taken my last drink.

16:55.231 --> 16:58.365
- Okay,
let's get you stabilized.

16:59.366 --> 17:00.976
Then I'll have a social worker
come down

17:01.020 --> 17:02.064
to go over the next steps.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.719
- Thank you.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.908
- A code in radiology?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.127
- Let's go.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.264
- Did he get contrast?

17:28.308 --> 17:29.961
- Just a minute ago.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.398
- Okay,
it's an allergic reaction.

17:31.441 --> 17:34.966
His throat's swelling.
.3 milligrams of epi IM.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.360
- Okay, Pete, just relax.
Try and take a deep breath.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.970
- Epi's in.

17:42.496 --> 17:45.064
- I need to intubate.
Laryngoscope and ET tube.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.544
- He said he didn't have
any allergies.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.242
- Look, you don't always know
until they happen.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.420
Tube's in.
Start bagging.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.208
- He's in V-fib.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.123
- Grab the paddles.
Curry, run the code.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.125
- What? No, I--
- Curry!

18:05.214 --> 18:07.216
- Okay, um--

18:07.260 --> 18:09.392
ch--charge to 200.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.268
Clear?

18:18.314 --> 18:21.143
- Still in V-fib.
Giving an amp of epi.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.231
- Again.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.582
- Charging to 200.
- Clear!

18:28.237 --> 18:31.284
- Charge it again.
April, 200.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.286
- It's over.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
- What?
- Call it.

18:41.642 --> 18:44.384
Time of death, 13:06.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.702
- And this young woman
with Down syndrome is 25?

18:58.746 --> 19:01.531
- Yes, she is an adult
and does not want the surgery.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.229
- Barbara has
a life-threatening condition.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.665
She needs this procedure.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.493
- And what happens
if she doesn't get it?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.234
- We will put her
on medication.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.887
We'll have her get weekly
checkups from her cardiologist.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.368
- And she'll likely still die
from heart failure.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.891
Barbara's mother
has spent her entire life

19:13.935 --> 19:15.545
caring for her daughter.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.373
Everything she's done,
she has done for her.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.983
We need to trust her judgment.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.681
- We need to let people
make their own decisions,

19:20.724 --> 19:23.031
not have them made
against their will.

19:23.074 --> 19:26.426
- I understand your concerns,
Dr. Rhodes,

19:26.469 --> 19:28.341
but the patient's mother

19:28.384 --> 19:31.996
does have legal
decision-making power.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.956
I don't see any choice
but to authorize the surgery.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.264
- Thank you.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.830
- Okay.

19:42.616 --> 19:43.747
We should give Barbara
some credit

19:43.791 --> 19:44.748
for knowing what she wants.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.054
- What is going on with you?

19:46.097 --> 19:47.664
- I want to honor
my patient's wishes.

19:47.708 --> 19:48.970
- No, we've had professional
disagreements before.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.973
This is different.
This feels personal.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.715
- All right.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.023
My father told me his version

19:59.067 --> 20:01.548
of how he came to donate
the money for the Hybrid OR.

20:01.591 --> 20:02.636
- Yeah, he said
I slept with him.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.072
He's lying.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.900
- He said that you were
the instigator,

20:05.943 --> 20:09.077
that you seduced him.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.430
It sounded like
he was telling the truth.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.829
- Patient is out
and we're on the move.

20:21.872 --> 20:25.006
- Copy that, squad three.
We'll notify Chicago Med.

20:25.049 --> 20:28.052
- I knew you didn't want to go,
but how's therapy going?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.970
- Only gone once,
but Dr. Moore seems fine.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.494
- Good.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.583
Well, I mean,
I'm glad you like her.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.020
- She spent a lot of time
waiting for me

20:39.063 --> 20:40.674
to say something,

20:40.717 --> 20:42.458
but I didn't know what
I was supposed to talk about.

20:42.502 --> 20:43.851
What happened, happened.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.810
- Dr. Manning!

20:46.854 --> 20:48.812
- His sats and heart rate
are tanking!

20:51.685 --> 20:53.817
- No breath sounds
on the left.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.602
The bag must've blown out
the lung.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.994
We need a chest tube.
- No, he's too anticoagulated.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.082
A chest tube might cause
a major bleed.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.606
I'm doing a needle.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.694
- Wait,
a needle is only temporary.

21:00.737 --> 21:01.999
He's still gonna need a tube.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.610
- We can deal with that
when we get there.

21:03.653 --> 21:06.395
He needs decompression now.
- Natalie--

21:06.439 --> 21:07.831
You know what? You're right.
Let's do a needle.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.403
Sats are back in the 80s.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.580
- Breath sounds are better.
Let's get him out of here.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.808
- Barbara, I'm very sorry

21:27.851 --> 21:30.027
but we do have to take you
up to surgery now.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.334
- No, I don't want to go.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.770
- Everything is only
getting worse.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.511
I'm afraid
we don't have a choice.

21:35.555 --> 21:36.860
- But my baby!

21:36.904 --> 21:38.514
- We're going to
do everything that we can

21:38.558 --> 21:40.037
to make sure that
your baby is safe.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.735
- You said you can't!

21:41.778 --> 21:44.433
You said my baby might die!

21:44.477 --> 21:45.826
Mom, make them stop!

21:45.869 --> 21:47.610
- Sweetie,
it's going to be okay.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.178
- Dr. Rhodes?

21:50.221 --> 21:51.875
- We're taking her up
to surgery now.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.707
- They're gonna kill my baby!

21:57.751 --> 22:00.536
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- It's my baby, Mom!

22:00.580 --> 22:03.539
No, I don't wanna go!
No!

22:03.583 --> 22:05.759
No, no!

22:11.591 --> 22:12.983
- You still haven't told her
about her husband.

22:16.465 --> 22:20.556
- Uh, no, I was--I was--
I was just about to.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.080
- Is this the first patient
you've lost?

22:23.124 --> 22:25.126
- Yeah.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.649
- You want to go over
what you should say?

22:26.693 --> 22:28.172
- No, no, I'm fine.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.087
We had a lecture on this
in second year.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.135
- Why don't I come with you?
- Okay.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.227
- I got worried.
It was taking so long.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.751
- Mrs. Flores, I'm afraid
there was a complication.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.100
- "Complication"?

22:43.144 --> 22:44.928
- Your husband had
an allergic reaction

22:44.972 --> 22:46.495
and stopped breathing.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.541
We tried to save him,

22:48.584 --> 22:51.413
but his heart went into
an arrhythmia and he--he died.

22:51.457 --> 22:52.675
- What?

22:52.719 --> 22:54.503
- Ventricular fibrillation.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.853
He--he died.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.986
- That doesn't make any sense.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.945
You--you said that--that
it was just his appendix

23:01.989 --> 23:03.947
and it was a simple procedure!

23:03.991 --> 23:06.820
- Yes, but this was
a--a contrast reaction

23:06.863 --> 23:08.430
which had nothing to do with--

23:08.474 --> 23:10.171
- He can't be dead!
- I'm afraid he is.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.781
His--his heart went into
a fatal arrhythmia.

23:11.825 --> 23:14.654
- That's not true!
He's not dead!

23:16.960 --> 23:19.572
- Mrs. Flores.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.749
Mrs. Flores, it is true.

23:22.792 --> 23:26.666
We did everything
that we could,

23:26.709 --> 23:28.232
but your husband is gone.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.756
I am so sorry.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.845
- No.
- I am so sorry.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.150
- No!

23:33.194 --> 23:34.238
- So sorry.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.680
Oh, God.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.813
No.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.772
- Help!
We need help!

23:45.815 --> 23:46.990
He's been throwing up.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.645
Activate the MTP
and get me an NG tube.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.168
- He's bleeding!
Please!

23:51.212 --> 23:52.909
- He has enlarged vessels
in his esophagus.

23:52.953 --> 23:54.258
They must've torn
from the vomiting.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.782
All right, Bruce,

23:55.825 --> 23:57.000
this is gonna
be uncomfortable,

23:57.044 --> 23:58.959
but I need you
to swallow for me, okay?

24:01.004 --> 24:03.616
- Hang on, Mr. Green.
This'll only take a second.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.189
- Have you been drinking?

24:12.233 --> 24:13.930
Have you been drinking
this whole time?

24:13.974 --> 24:15.584
- Call GI.

24:15.628 --> 24:17.543
We gotta send him upstairs
for ligation.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.806
- How could you?
You're killing yourself!

24:19.849 --> 24:21.155
- Bruce,
we can't stop the bleeding.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.678
We have to send you upstairs
for a procedure.

24:22.722 --> 24:23.679
Let's go!

24:23.723 --> 24:25.594
- This is what you get!

24:25.638 --> 24:28.118
- This is what you get!

24:31.078 --> 24:33.297
- The procedure
could take awhile.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.995
I'll bring you to a room
where you can wait.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.866
- It's fine.

24:36.910 --> 24:40.348
Bastard.

24:40.391 --> 24:43.612
Where's Jesse?

24:43.656 --> 24:45.701
Jesse?
Where is he?

24:45.745 --> 24:47.181
- Jesse!

24:47.224 --> 24:49.139
Hank, have you seen her son?
Broken arm?

24:50.706 --> 24:51.707
- I didn't see him.

24:51.751 --> 24:52.969
- Where did he go?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.754
- Let's check
the waiting room.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.239
- You've seen a kid
with a cast?

25:02.283 --> 25:04.372
- Yeah, he was going towards
the elevators.

25:04.415 --> 25:05.982
- Call security right now.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.995
- Stay there.

25:34.358 --> 25:37.579
Ooh, it's cold out here.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.191
- Leave me alone.

25:45.631 --> 25:49.591
- Jesse, I want you to know
that I--I really...

25:49.635 --> 25:54.988
I really understand how hard
this all is for you.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.599
You've been put in
a really tough situation.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.645
I know it sucks.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.392
You know I got this hunch...

26:08.436 --> 26:12.005
maybe you didn't fall
out of your treehouse.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.746
That maybe you jumped
because you just

26:13.789 --> 26:17.271
want all the pain
to go away.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.142
You didn't want
to feel all those--

26:19.186 --> 26:21.492
those helpless feelings
anymore.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.063
I get that.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.807
I think that

26:31.851 --> 26:35.463
probably your dad
feels that way...

26:35.506 --> 26:37.813
when he wants to drink.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.386
You might think that your dad

26:45.429 --> 26:47.562
acts the way he does 'cause
he doesn't care about you.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.261
Nothing could be further
from the truth.

26:51.305 --> 26:52.741
You--your dad drinks

26:52.785 --> 26:55.657
'cause he's trying
to get away from--

26:55.701 --> 26:59.226
from the difficult feelings,

26:59.269 --> 27:00.749
and not wanting
to feel those feelings,

27:00.793 --> 27:05.058
I mean, it's the most
normal thing in the world.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.842
Yeah.

27:06.886 --> 27:10.541
Thing is, it turns out that
the only way to make them

27:10.585 --> 27:13.153
go away is to talk about them.

27:14.720 --> 27:19.159
Yeah, talking about them, it
can make bad feelings go away

27:19.202 --> 27:20.769
and it also helps you
understand them better

27:20.813 --> 27:22.771
if they come back.

27:24.381 --> 27:27.558
You know,
so if you're up for it,

27:27.602 --> 27:29.778
I'd be really interested to
talk about that stuff with you,

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
if you want.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.435
I mean, think about it.

27:34.478 --> 27:37.264
In the meantime...

27:37.307 --> 27:39.658
what I really want to do,
I want to get you back inside

27:39.701 --> 27:41.660
so your mom and dad
know that you're safe.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.490
They're really worried
about you.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.406
You know why?

27:49.450 --> 27:51.104
It's just they love you
so much.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.327
So what do you say?

27:59.329 --> 28:00.591
Do you wanna go back inside?

28:17.391 --> 28:19.306
- Ms. Duncan?

28:20.220 --> 28:23.527
Sharon Goodwin,
Director of Patient Services.

28:23.571 --> 28:26.661
I wanted to return
your legal documents.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.751
- Have you heard anything?
Is Barbara okay?

28:29.795 --> 28:32.536
- I'm sorry.
I don't have any news yet,

28:32.580 --> 28:35.539
but could I get someone
to bring something for you

28:35.583 --> 28:36.671
from the cafeteria?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.673
A sandwich or some coffee?

28:38.717 --> 28:40.414
- I'm not hungry.
Thank you.

28:40.457 --> 28:42.590
- Yeah, I'm sure
this isn't easy.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.507
- If the baby dies,

28:46.550 --> 28:48.727
I don't think Barbara
will ever forgive me.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.600
Do you have children,
Miss Goodwin?

28:52.643 --> 28:55.734
- I do, three,
but they're all grown.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.432
- With Barbara,

28:58.475 --> 29:01.304
it's like having a child
who never grows up.

29:01.348 --> 29:03.480
Don't get me wrong.

29:03.524 --> 29:06.483
I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.574
It's just the possibility
of having another one.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.882
It's a lot.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.538
I mean, the baby doesn't have
Down syndrome, it's not that.

29:17.581 --> 29:19.975
It's just...

29:20.019 --> 29:22.630
I'm not 30 anymore and...

29:22.673 --> 29:25.198
- You don't feel up to it.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.590
- So I keep asking myself,

29:26.634 --> 29:28.854
when I pushed so hard
for this surgery...

29:30.681 --> 29:33.815
- Did you do it for
your daughter or yourself?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.558
Now, come.

29:47.307 --> 29:50.789
- Scalpel and Debakeys?
- Scalpel and Debakeys.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.008
- Marty?

29:53.052 --> 29:54.662
- Fetal heart rate
is down to 115.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.446
- Can you get it back up?

29:56.490 --> 30:00.450
- Transfusing her.
We're down to 109.

30:00.494 --> 30:01.756
103.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.888
- We're going to lose
the fetus.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.498
- Where are we at
on the bypass?

30:04.541 --> 30:06.761
- 4 liters.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.849
- Crank it up to 6.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.590
- Wait, what are you doing?

30:09.633 --> 30:11.026
- The fetus needs more blood.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.027
- Connor, our priority is
to save the patient,

30:12.071 --> 30:13.028
not the fetus.

30:13.072 --> 30:14.813
- We can save both.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.423
- If you flood too much blood
to Barbara's brain,

30:16.466 --> 30:17.990
she could have permanent
neurological damage.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.426
It could put her into a coma.

30:19.469 --> 30:20.819
- Fetal heart rate's down
to 86.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.386
- Connor, it's too dangerous.

30:23.430 --> 30:24.648
- Dr. Rhodes?

30:24.692 --> 30:26.302
- It's what Barbara wants.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.435
Turn the bypass up to 6.

30:34.484 --> 30:38.053
- Curry, write some admissions
orders for Mr. Bane in 6.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.316
- Okay.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.719
- I'm so sorry, Will...

31:38.026 --> 31:40.986
For the way things
got between us.

31:41.029 --> 31:43.989
- Yeah.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.774
- You went through
something terrible

31:46.817 --> 31:50.430
and I never even asked you
what it was like

31:50.473 --> 31:52.562
to have your life in danger.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.002
I can't even imagine.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.056
- You know,
when I was in that room,

32:08.100 --> 32:09.536
afraid I was going to die,

32:09.579 --> 32:11.930
all I could think was...

32:13.105 --> 32:14.802
I'd never see you again.

32:31.036 --> 32:34.039
- I can't believe it.
My baby...

32:34.082 --> 32:36.911
My baby tried to kill himself.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.870
- We're going to keep Jesse
here for a few days

32:39.914 --> 32:41.046
if that's all right.

32:41.089 --> 32:42.699
You know, see how he does,

32:42.743 --> 32:45.093
come up with
a treatment plan for him.

32:45.137 --> 32:47.095
- But then what?

32:47.139 --> 32:51.186
After we get home,
I already missed this once.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.101
- The signs aren't
always so apparent.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.016
You got to take it easy
on yourself.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.931
It's not like you haven't
had other stuff going on.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.672
- Oh, God.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.153
How do I help him?

33:01.196 --> 33:03.459
- You--you wanna communicate
with him.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.681
Talk to him, listen,

33:07.724 --> 33:11.032
have honest conversations about
what's going on in your family.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.643
I think for Jesse,
just knowing that you're there,

33:13.687 --> 33:15.732
it'll go a very long way.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.827
- You ready?
- Yeah.

33:29.616 --> 33:30.704
Jesse...

33:30.747 --> 33:33.576
- Hey, Mom.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.235
We're gonna get through this.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.889
I promise.

33:55.729 --> 33:57.731
- Mrs. Green,

33:57.774 --> 34:00.821
uh, we heard your husband's
procedure went well.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.084
- I'm leaving him.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.478
We're gonna go stay with
my sister.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.523
- Okay.

34:07.567 --> 34:08.959
- Bruce says he'll go to rehab,

34:09.003 --> 34:11.092
that he'll stop drinking,
but...

34:11.136 --> 34:14.878
I cannot risk Jesse's life
on the chance that he doesn't.

34:16.010 --> 34:19.796
And if he can stay sober
for three months,

34:19.840 --> 34:21.668
I'll go back to him.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.897
- It takes a lot of courage
to make a sacrifice like that.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.682
- Yeah.

34:35.725 --> 34:37.814
- Maybe now that'll finally
get his attention.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.948
- Let's hope so.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.171
- Dr. Rhodes,
she's waking up.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.651
- Barbie,
it's me, Mom.

34:50.044 --> 34:52.829
Barbie?
- Mom?

34:54.962 --> 34:57.007
- Barbara,
do you know where you are?

34:57.051 --> 34:58.922
- Hospital?
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.577
- How is my baby?

35:01.621 --> 35:03.797
- Why don't we find out?

35:04.276 --> 35:05.799
Can you help me out there?

35:07.714 --> 35:09.107
All right.

35:12.632 --> 35:15.852
Good, and...

35:15.896 --> 35:17.202
there he is.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.856
- Look at him.

35:19.900 --> 35:22.076
Look at his little hand.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.947
Mom, isn't he cute?

35:25.079 --> 35:27.212
- He's beautiful.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.605
We're going to have
a beautiful baby.

35:47.406 --> 35:50.017
- Looks like the fever's
starting to break.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.106
He should be off ECMO soon.

35:53.760 --> 35:56.893
Good.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.161
Have a good night.

36:03.204 --> 36:04.858
- Will?

36:08.775 --> 36:11.778
I want you to come back home.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.127
To me.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.610
- You do?

36:17.653 --> 36:21.962
- The thing is, you have
to get rid of your gun.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.226
I'm sorry, but that's
just how it has to be.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.276
- Okay.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.973
I'll take it to the
police station tonight

36:33.016 --> 36:34.366
and, uh, turn it in.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.687
- April.
- Have a good night.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.341
- April--April.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.256
We should talk about that kiss.

36:56.475 --> 36:58.303
- I'm sorry that happened.

36:58.346 --> 37:01.697
I know you're with Vicki now.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.395
There's nothing for us
to talk about.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.363
- I cannot believe that
you are even considering

37:15.407 --> 37:17.452
taking your father's word
over mine.

37:22.370 --> 37:25.286
- Ava, every step of the way,
you have lied to me.

37:25.330 --> 37:28.158
About going to my dad, about
knowing that he cut the check.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.465
How am I supposed to believe
anything that you have to say?

37:30.509 --> 37:33.294
- Because I care about you

37:33.338 --> 37:36.689
and he doesn't!

37:36.732 --> 37:38.865
He never has.

37:38.908 --> 37:41.476
Your whole life, he's tried
to keep you under his thumb.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.697
He's attempted to undermine
everything you do.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.873
He's trying to drive
a wedge between us.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.701
- He said that he liked
your perfume.

37:51.094 --> 37:53.227
That it smelled like lilacs.
It does.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.055
- So what?

37:55.098 --> 37:56.361
I was standing over him.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.014
I was--I was showing him
the prospectus.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.887
That doesn't mean anything.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.498
- "The ends justify
the means."

38:03.542 --> 38:05.500
Those were your words.

38:05.544 --> 38:08.242
- Connor...

38:08.286 --> 38:10.418
I did not sleep with
your father.

38:13.943 --> 38:15.902
- I wish I could believe you.

38:27.217 --> 38:30.395
- Daniel, it's late.
You still doing notes?

38:30.438 --> 38:33.398
- Yeah, just cleaning
a couple of things up.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.356
- What are you doing?

38:35.400 --> 38:38.054
- Nothing.
What are you doing?

38:38.098 --> 38:40.840
- Let me see.
A dating profile?

38:40.883 --> 38:43.103
Really?

38:43.146 --> 38:44.974
I thought you didn't
trust algorithms.

38:45.018 --> 38:46.411
- I don't.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.369
- Ah, you're just scared.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.110
- I am.

38:50.153 --> 38:51.938
- So what changed?

38:51.981 --> 38:54.288
- I don't know.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.944
I witnessed this real act
of courage today,

38:57.987 --> 38:59.946
love even.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.340
Maybe it made me
a little braver.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.124
What can I say?
Hope springs eternal.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.127
- "Tell us about yourself."
What am I supposed to say?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.476
"Jazz, walks on the beach"?

39:08.520 --> 39:10.217
- You don't like jazz.
You like hip-hop.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.001
- I like everything.
- Come on.

39:12.045 --> 39:13.438
I got all night.
Let's do this.

39:13.481 --> 39:17.006
- Oh, man.
