-I want to be friends.
-We are friends.

00:04.375 --> 00:07.291
-Just friends.
-Well, I talked to my director

00:07.375 --> 00:09.208
about who should play my love interest
in <i>Forever April,</i>

00:09.291 --> 00:11.875
and she wants a Joe from Jonas type.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.542
There's a roomful of me's in there
and I'm freaking out.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.542
-Hang in there, man. I've got an idea.
-Action.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.542
I'm a ghost.
Ghosts can't love.

00:19.625 --> 00:23.208
If we never try, then we'll
never know what could have been.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.125
-I got the part!
-Congratulations!

00:27.458 --> 00:29.041

Come on, girl.
We're almost at the top.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.750
There had better be
an air-conditioned mall up there.

00:45.834 --> 00:49.291
All right, princess.
You rest. I'll be right back.

00:49.375 --> 00:53.875
Yeah? Well, if I was a princess,
I'd have someone walk for me!

00:56.709 --> 00:58.875
-Oh. Oh.
-Oh, sorry.

going to run into me,

I'm glad it was you.
Hey, I know you.

Sorry, I'm... I'm such a mess.

01:14.041 --> 01:18.166
I was attacked... by a bear.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.083
I'm guessing you're more of
an indoor girl.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.959
I like a wall and a window now and then.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.166
That's probably why I haven't
seen you on the trail before.

[thudding]

01:32.959 --> 01:35.583
So many mosquitoes out here in nature.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.125
Well, maybe we'd be better off
doing something inside

01:38.208 --> 01:41.500
like eating some
frozen yogurt or something.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.166

01:44.250 --> 01:46.542
Great. I'll pick you up around 7:00.

[singsong voice]
I'll tell you in a second.

01:57.917 --> 02:01.917
I just have to keep smiling and waving
until he's down that hill.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.709

He just asked me out!

Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.667
-Big announcement?
-[DZ exhales]

03:17.750 --> 03:21.583
Let me put this in the form
of a riddle.

03:21.667 --> 03:25.875
Now what has two paddles, a net,
and the hottest celebrities in town?

03:25.959 --> 03:28.291
Are you talking about Justin Timberlake's
ping-pong tournament?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.000
Correct. Now, this is
the biggest charity event

03:31.083 --> 03:33.417
of the summer, OK?
JT's all about giving back.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.291
Yeah, we know all about it,
but all the spots are booked.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.667
I guess it just depends on who you know.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.041
You see, my cousin is
the assistant to the guy,

03:41.166 --> 03:43.458
who's the assistant to the guy,
who picks the players.

03:43.542 --> 03:46.667
So, I've secured an invitation
for one lucky Jonai...

03:47.917 --> 03:49.792
Happens to be singular, the Jonai.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.542
No, it's not.
But more to the point,

03:52.625 --> 03:55.250
that means that only
one of us gets to play.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.125
-Yeah.
-Correct-amente.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.792
FYI, I'm adding "amente"
to everything I say.

03:59.875 --> 04:04.333
So which one of you three,
is the best-amente?

04:04.417 --> 04:06.542
Me, I'd probably crush it,
but I've gotta study my script

04:06.625 --> 04:08.125
for the movie that I'm starring in,
<i>Forever April.</i>

04:08.208 --> 04:10.417
So, Joe Hollywood is out.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.041
How about you guys, huh?

04:12.125 --> 04:15.625
Why don't you play for it?
Kevin vs. Nick?

I'm in.
A little brotherly competition.

-I'm in.
-Oh.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.583

So...

04:23.667 --> 04:27.625
Excited-amente. All right.
Good luck on that. All righty.

"I need your love.
You need my love."

I'm going on my first LA date.

you work pretty fast.

Wait. Issue.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.667
-What?
-Joe.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.500
Right. Well, are you going
to tell him about Ben?

04:52.583 --> 04:54.166
I mean, am I supposed to?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.750
I don't know.
Oh, OK.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.625
Let's play it out.
I'll be Joe.

04:58.709 --> 05:00.166
What would you say to me?

05:00.250 --> 05:04.542
-So, Joe, um, I met a guy.
-No!

05:04.625 --> 05:06.959
No! How could you betray me?!

05:07.041 --> 05:09.667
Macy, he's not gonna do that.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.083
Well, I was just showing you
the worst-case scenario.

05:12.166 --> 05:16.333
OK. Um, well, can we please try
the best-case scenario?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.667
-OK, fine.
-OK.

05:18.750 --> 05:22.625
So, Joe, I met this guy
and we're gonna go on a date.

05:22.709 --> 05:24.542
Oh, that's great. Have fun.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.250
I never had feelings for you anyway.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.625
That's the best-case scenario?

05:28.709 --> 05:29.750
Oh, wait.

05:30.250 --> 05:33.458
Here's 50 bucks.
Take him someplace classy.

-Hey, Stell.

Hi, baby.

05:46.542 --> 05:49.208

-Vanessa. Expecting rain?

Oh, no. I'm actually playing
a ghost in <i>Forever April,</i>

so I can't be in the sun.
I tan uber easy.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.500
Uber awesome.

agreeing to dog sit Chakra for me.

Wow. So, you're dog sitting...

06:15.583 --> 06:18.583
-Yeah.
-For Vanessa.

06:21.166 --> 06:22.458
OK.

06:22.542 --> 06:26.041

in an underground spa, so...

06:26.375 --> 06:28.250
Oh, let me guess, uber exclusive?

06:28.333 --> 06:32.583
Oh, no, it's literally underground...
in a cave.

06:33.417 --> 06:34.792
So what's up, Stells?

06:35.417 --> 06:38.333
Um, I actually just came to say hi.

06:39.291 --> 06:43.208
And now I'm going,
so, Joe, happy dog sitting.

06:43.291 --> 06:46.959
Vanessa... watch out for bats.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.208
Hey, bro. Look what I found,

07:09.291 --> 07:12.250
-one of these things.
-Oh, so you're practicing.

07:12.333 --> 07:13.917
Because where I come from,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.083
a friendly game means
you pick up a paddle and you play.

07:17.166 --> 07:18.667
Well, you're welcome
to use it if you want.

07:18.750 --> 07:19.834
It's all good, brother.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.959
-What does that mean?
-Do what you need to do.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.458
OK.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.000
[Aunt Lisa] Isn't this fun?

07:34.083 --> 07:34.917
Mm-hmm.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.542
-What are you knitting?
-A scarf.

07:36.625 --> 07:37.875
-Oh.
-Or a sock.

07:37.959 --> 07:38.792
Huh.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.083
It depends what part of me
gets cold first.

07:40.166 --> 07:42.542
-What about you?
-Oh. Cat sweater!

07:42.959 --> 07:44.375
Doesn't your cat have fur?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.875
[baby voice] But it goes so well
with his little hat.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.458
He's taking care of Vanessa's dog.

07:50.542 --> 07:52.959
[exclaims]
No, he is not!

07:53.041 --> 07:56.291
Yeah, he is. I mean, I don't know
how they got so far so fast.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.375
Usually you meet, you flirt, you date,
you introduce him to your parents,

07:59.458 --> 08:02.250
and then maybe you let him dog sit.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.709
Well, he has clearly moved on
and so should you.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.917

-Oh, I am moving, baby,

Oh, after I meet him?

-He's not a rock star.
-Love him.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.542
Yes, ladies, this date with Ben
is going down.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.667
-I am talking frozen yogurt...
-Mmm.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.333
-With toppings.

in table tennis world cup.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.208
You hired a coach?

08:42.291 --> 08:44.083
And you, sir, bought a ball machine.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.000
Just say it. You're afraid to lose
to your little brother.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.458
"Lose"? Oh, no. I just want to make sure
you were properly schooled

08:50.542 --> 08:52.333
-when I beat you.
-You are so going down.

08:52.417 --> 08:54.417
[sighs] That's cute and all,
but can you leave now?

08:54.500 --> 08:57.500
'Cause she's about to teach me a move
she likes to call the cobra chop.

Chop.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.917
So remember,
he only drinks bottled water,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.709
no carbs after 4:00 p.m.
and no loud noises.

-His ears are very sensitive.
-[whispers] I think we'll be fine.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.875
-I'll call you when I get there.
-Cool.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.625
-I was talking to Chakra.
-Right.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.458
-[kisses]
-Yeah, I knew that.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.417
-[chuckles]
-And one for you.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.291
You can sleep in Nick's bed.
Yes, you can.

Come on.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.417
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hey, can I help you?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.583
Yeah, I'm looking for a Stella.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.750
-You are?
-Ben. I met Stella hiking today

09:38.834 --> 09:40.917
and I found her keys on the trail.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.750
At least I think they're hers.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.250
-Yeah, those are Stella's.
-Do you know if she's around?

09:45.333 --> 09:47.500
If not, I'll just see her tonight.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.792
-What's tonight?
-Our date.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.000
So what you're telling me
is your name is Ben,

09:58.083 --> 10:00.125
-and you have a date with Stella.
-Yeah.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.208
I think we have a lot we could talk about.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.333
Why don't you come on in?

10:11.083 --> 10:12.667
Cobra chop!

10:12.750 --> 10:14.875
-Aloha, brother.
-What's all this?

10:14.959 --> 10:17.417
Well, I know some words have
been exchanged, some not so pleasant,

10:17.500 --> 10:19.083
so I decided to do something nice for you.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.041
Really?
This is for me?

10:21.583 --> 10:23.083
Well, I know how much you like relaxing.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.750
I do like to take a load off.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.709
All right. Well, try it out.
Take this coconut smoothie,

10:27.792 --> 10:30.166
lay down on this thing
and just relax.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.417
Don't mind if I do.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.417
Oh, I almost forgot... ladies.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
-Oh.
-How does that feel?

10:35.583 --> 10:37.875
Ah. Like a cool island breeze.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.667
Very relaxing.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.041
Wait a second!

10:41.125 --> 10:43.500
-I know what you're trying to do here.
-What would that be?

10:43.583 --> 10:46.542
You're trying to recreate that sweet,
sweet nap I took in Maui.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.000
Ah, the nap of all naps.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.375
The nap of your dreams.
Now why would I do that?

10:51.458 --> 10:53.125
To make me groggy for the match.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.583
You're trying to make me lose
my competitive edge.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.458
Shh... relax.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.959
It would be nice.
I mean...

11:01.041 --> 11:02.667
No! Not at all! Absolutely not.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.166
-Not gonna work.
-All right, fine.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.458
But I know how cranky you get
without your nap.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.208
You're going down
a bad road here, brother.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.208
You'll be sorry
you messed with the master.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.750
No one said stop.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.959
Ah. Here you go, my buddy, Ben.

11:22.959 --> 11:24.792
Thanks.
So, is Stella home?

11:24.875 --> 11:28.041
Oh, we'll get to Stella.
I want to talk about Ben.

11:28.125 --> 11:31.917
-What gets Ben up every morning?
-Um, well, I'm a student.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.458
So, what I'm hearing is you're unemployed.

11:33.542 --> 11:36.250
-No, I work part time, too.
-Mmm, flipping burgers?

11:36.333 --> 11:39.875
Actually, I invented a cell-phone app.
It's kind of popular.

11:39.959 --> 11:42.959
Well, I'm pretty
cell-phone-app savvy myself.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.959
So, what's it called?

11:45.041 --> 11:46.709
It's called the Side Burner.

11:46.792 --> 11:49.333
-It lets you take any photo and--
-Put sideburns on it?

11:49.417 --> 11:52.333
Dude, I love that app.
You invented that?

11:52.417 --> 11:54.041
Yeah, it's no big deal.

-Can you be more specific?
-Specifically, my lucky sneakers.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.125
The white ones with the blue stripes?
I haven't seen 'em.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.417

-Oh, now you're resorting to name-calling.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.208
-I know what you're trying to do.
-And that would be what?

12:17.291 --> 12:19.000
You think I'm so superstitious

12:19.083 --> 12:21.250
-I need those shoes to win.
-Those are your words, not mine.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.667
-You're not getting inside my head.
-I think I already am.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.792

I could beat you without shoes.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.166
I could beat you without socks.
I could beat you without feet!

12:28.250 --> 12:30.125

12:44.083 --> 12:45.625
So, where are you taking Stella tonight?

12:45.709 --> 12:49.250
-Um, to get frozen yogurt.
-What do you have against ice cream?

12:49.333 --> 12:52.208
-Higher fat content.
-Oh, boy.

-Cobra chop.

-Just bring them.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.375

So, what you're telling me, Ben,
if that's your real name,

13:51.750 --> 13:54.750
is that you're gonna take Stella
out to "fro-yo,"

13:54.834 --> 13:56.750
and if it goes well,
you might ask her out again?

13:56.834 --> 14:00.041

Well, what am I supposed to do,

14:46.709 --> 14:48.542
seeing as you decided
to keep the whole thing from me?

14:48.625 --> 14:50.625
Uh, I tried to tell you,
but you were a little too busy

14:50.709 --> 14:53.208

14:56.875 --> 14:57.709
And you didn't tell me.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.166
Well, you didn't tell me
about the dog sitting.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.834
I didn't tell you about my
dentist appointment either.

15:00.917 --> 15:01.917
What's the big deal?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.542
Vanessa is trusting you
with something that she loves.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.834
-That's a big step in a relationship.
-We're not in a relationship.

15:07.917 --> 15:09.250
Well, she thinks that you are.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.333
Yet you're the one who has a date tonight.

-She has a date tonight,

16:10.500 --> 16:13.208
-and she didn't tell me.
-But didn't you guys decide to be friends?

16:13.333 --> 16:15.375
Doesn't that mean you're free to date
whoever you want?

16:15.458 --> 16:19.125
Yeah, but I just pictured myself dating
and Stella just... not.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.625
You do realize how it sounds, right?

16:23.166 --> 16:26.000
When I just said it,
I realized what a jerk I sounded like.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, well, you shouldn't tell us.
You should tell her.

as a friendly game of ping-pong.
