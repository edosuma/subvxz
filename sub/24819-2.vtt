00:13.346 --> 00:14.597
[Ethan] Oh, yeah.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.891
Oh, yeah. Is that better?

00:16.975 --> 00:19.477
Oh, God, I'm so worried about work today.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.688
I wish I wasn't working at a hedge fund.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.691
That's just
first day of school jitters, okay?

00:24.774 --> 00:28.194
You're going to be the smartest person
in the place. Remember that.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.740
It's not that. It's... the evil.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.824
[bed springs creak]

00:34.492 --> 00:35.368
[Lisa] Oh, yeah.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.413
-[Lisa] Oh, God, give it to me.
-[Ethan] I'm gonna give it to you.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.081
-[floor squeaks]
-Take it. Here.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.625
What was that?
What was that? Marianne?

00:42.709 --> 00:45.503
[Ethan whispers] No, no, no.
I'm telling you, that can't be Marianne.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.882
There's no way she's up this early.
What does she have to do? Nothing.

00:48.965 --> 00:50.341
-[Ethan laughs]
-[Lisa] You're right.

00:50.425 --> 00:53.178
She's like a... She's like a cat.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.137
[Ethan laughs]

00:54.220 --> 00:56.056
[Lisa] All she does is nap and eat.

00:56.639 --> 00:57.974
[Marianne] Good morning, guys!

00:58.516 --> 00:59.559
[Ethan whispers] Shit.

01:00.018 --> 01:00.852
Hey, what?

01:00.935 --> 01:02.771
Hey. Oh, we're waking up.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.356
-What time is it?
-Oh, we're waking up. Oh.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.110
We're just waking up.
We're literally just waking up now.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.362
-[Lisa] What's happening?
-[Ethan] So, hey, look at you.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.323
Some early morning yoga, huh?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.492
Yep. 6:30 a.m. class.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.118
-Good for you.
-Really wonderful.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.080
[Ethan] That's wonderful. That's good.
A good way to start the day.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.207
Do you think she heard us?

01:22.665 --> 01:24.417
What? No, it's fine.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.171
Hey, Marianne, I'm gonna make
some coffee. Do you want some?

01:28.254 --> 01:29.547
[Marianne] Oh, yeah.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.258
[mimicking Lisa] Give it to me.
Oh, give it to me.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.014
[rock song playing]

01:46.689 --> 01:48.858
-Okay. I'm off.
-I love you, babe.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.527
And I am proud of you.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.071
At least one of us is. Bye, Marianne.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.573
-Bye! Good luck!
-Remember, you're not evil.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.117
-I'm not evil!
-You are not evil!

01:57.200 --> 02:00.245
Ahh! I'm so nervous! I don't know
what to do with this energy.

02:00.328 --> 02:02.330
Opening night of your play! I can't wait!

02:02.413 --> 02:04.499
-Yeah, me too! Okay, Ethan.
-Yes.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.459
-I need a huge favor.
-Anything.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.129
I need you to take Anastasia to the vet
for a check-up.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.924
I'd do it, but I'm the only point person
between the YMCA and production.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.218
-Sure. Why not? Okay.
-Okay.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.637
-All right. Ooh! You're the best.
-Right. Yeah.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.181
-I'll text you the doctor's information.
-Okay.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.976
-Wish me luck!
-Have a good day. Alright, take care.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.145
Okay.

02:25.228 --> 02:28.606
Alright, Anastasia,

You're FaceTiming me!

02:46.416 --> 02:49.377
[groans] <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>Hold on, I'll call you back.</i>

Hello. Yeah. You really like
talking to my face, don't ya?

<i>We should meet in person.</i>

[ominous organ music plays]

03:51.689 --> 03:53.107
Welcome, madam.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.902
I'll tell my master you've arrived.

04:04.911 --> 04:05.828
I am not eating here.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.706
You said pick a place that's discreet,
where we would not be recognized.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.168
-Fair enough.
-[chuckles]

04:12.252 --> 04:14.963
It's weird,
there's no internal consistency here.

04:15.046 --> 04:19.384
Some of the food here is monster-themed
and some of it... Is it Tex-Mex?

04:19.467 --> 04:21.552
The other night was crazy.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.096
And not in a good way.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.390
I know, I'm sorry. It was stupid.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.100
-I feel awful.
-[sighs]

04:27.183 --> 04:29.310
We're... We're bad people.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.813
-Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
-I said "we"!

04:32.522 --> 04:35.191
My husband was in the next room.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.402
Your wife was downstairs.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.405
-My children were asleep in their beds.
-Okay. I know!

04:40.488 --> 04:42.949
What happened
to the "let's just be friends" plan?

04:44.659 --> 04:45.994
I don't know what to say.

04:47.328 --> 04:52.166
This has been going on for so long,
I have no idea what to tell you. I...

04:53.126 --> 04:54.377
I'm not proud.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.048
All I know is I can't sleep...

05:00.466 --> 05:02.010
thinking about our kiss.

05:03.928 --> 05:07.682
I... will admit, it was a good one.

05:07.765 --> 05:08.850
Right?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.269
Hey! Is that Ethan?

05:11.352 --> 05:12.770
Ethan Turner!

05:12.854 --> 05:14.439
-Hey. How are you?
-I'm Bob Nano.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.482
-I was a year below you at Harvard.
-Oh!

05:16.566 --> 05:18.026
-Yes!
-Dunster House, right?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.403
-Yes, alright!
-This is my son, Spencer.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.947
-We're here for his birthday.
-Hey, man. Happy birthday.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.825
You look familiar.
You went to Harvard, too, didn't you?

05:25.908 --> 05:27.660
-Nope.
-Did not go to college.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.830
-Just went to the school of hard knocks.
-It's great to see ya.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.124
-Alright, yeah. Go away.
-What? Did you...

05:33.207 --> 05:34.459
-Yeah.
-Okay.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.044
See you later!

05:38.713 --> 05:41.799
-How is that guy younger than me?
-That's what you're thinking about?

05:41.883 --> 05:45.261
His son has a mustache.
Are we old enough to have mustache babies?

05:45.344 --> 05:48.931
-Your soul belongs to me now!
-[yelling] Nope! Gotta go!

05:49.015 --> 05:51.809
God, is there anywhere in New York City
where we're safe?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.188
-[waiter] Say it with me. It's alive!
-[thunder crashes over speakers]

05:55.688 --> 05:57.940
It's alive!

05:59.275 --> 06:01.152
[whispers] We have to get out of here.

06:02.695 --> 06:06.616
I'm glad you're here. Our legal team has
had quite a large workload as of late.

06:06.699 --> 06:10.912
Well, from what I read, the new
SEC regulations can be quite complex.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.330
They can be.

06:12.413 --> 06:16.167
We also deal with our fair share
of sexual harassment claims.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.628
Sexual harassment from where?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.254
Within the firm.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.509
The culture here at Blackstool
is quite... masculine.

06:25.426 --> 06:28.888
I don't mean to bias you, but it's better
that you know sooner than later.

06:28.971 --> 06:33.601
Well, I used to work for the ACLU
defending neo-Nazis' freedom of speech,

06:33.684 --> 06:35.645
so I think I'm going to be okay.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.313
Have you been to Scores?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.816
Scores, the strip club?

06:40.191 --> 06:41.067
Yes.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.611
No, I don't think I have. No.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.404
You will go.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.286
Okay, great.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.622
[on speakerphone] <i>Wanna make sure</i>

-You must be Lisa.
-Yeah.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.545
I thought you should hear this.
It's the SEC.

07:00.628 --> 07:04.006
Oh, yeah, I think we are on the same page,
you fucking cocksucker!

07:06.050 --> 07:08.177
Sorry, they put it on mute.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.514
You fucking bitch!

Whoo! I love it. I love this, you guys.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.270
<i>-The SEC imposes on...</i>
-Yeah.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.814
I missed that.
What's the last thing you said?

Lisa Turner's our new in-house counsel.
She's going to say what's up.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.638
Uh... Yeah, hello.
I look forward to working with you.

-Call him a fucking pussy.

<i>-Now that we've gone over that...</i>
-No.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.107
-You can do it. It's fine.
-Mrs. Turner, you can do it.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.443
-You don't understand. He can't hear.
-Yeah.

08:05.526 --> 08:08.779
-You can hear him, but...
-He can't hear us. I pushed the button.

No, thank you.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.241
-Thank you, no.
-Alright, whatever.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.620
Uh, my only question is...
how big is your dad's balls?

-Fuck!

-Sorry. Totally right.
-We gotta be on the same fucking page.

-I'm so sorry, Mike.
-Mike, did you just yell something?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.338
Yeah, we heard a weird thing.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.715
-Did you talk about my dad's balls?
-What?

08:27.798 --> 08:29.425
So you went to Harvard?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.093
Yeah.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.221
-I went to Princeton.
-Right.

[Fammer] Little help.

You're like a sex narrator.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.834
Oh, no. Jon changed the code.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.754
Wait, what? What does that mean
that Jon changed the code?

09:06.837 --> 09:10.007
Well, we change it sometimes.
They make you change it.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.676
Okay, why is it going faster?

09:18.182 --> 09:19.976
Jon doesn't know I'm here.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.937
If security comes, he'll know.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.189
Oh, God. Okay.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.942
Uh... I think the code's on one of these.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.779
Is it this? Is it this right here?

09:31.862 --> 09:33.573
What? That's a place mat!

09:33.656 --> 09:36.534
Does it look like a security code?
That's a drawing Pearl made.

09:36.617 --> 09:39.787
I was looking for something laminated.
Now I see it's a castle.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.248
She's very good for her age.
I can tell what it is.

09:42.331 --> 09:47.878
You know what? We'll just leave and we'll
say that it was an electrical malfunction.

No, it doesn't!

10:07.565 --> 10:09.066
That's the security company.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.986
We have three minutes till they get here.
We gotta go!

10:12.653 --> 10:15.906
Wait! Fingerprints.
We've got to wipe everything down.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.909
-I live here!
-Right. God damn it, you're good.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.497
[cell phone rings]

10:23.581 --> 10:26.417
-Wait a sec.
-What are you doing? Why are you stopping?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.878
-Do you have a menstrual cramp?
-Lisa is calling.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.380
So call her back at a more opportune time!

10:31.464 --> 10:33.424
I can't. It'll look suspicious.

10:33.507 --> 10:36.927
No, I know what regulations are.
I fucking invented regulations!

10:37.011 --> 10:39.347
Tell them to fuck the regulations
like I fucked his wife.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.682
Fuck your regulations
like my friend fucked your wife.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.601
-Like you did.
-Like I fucked your wife.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.935
[Ethan] <i>Hey, babe!</i>

10:45.019 --> 10:47.229
<i>How was your first day at the hedge fund?</i>

10:47.313 --> 10:51.192
Well, you know how I thought
it was going to be horrible? It's worse.

10:51.275 --> 10:52.568
This guy's fucked-up dick.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.445
-That's great!
<i>-What?</i>

10:54.528 --> 10:57.073
That's awful.
I meant to say that that's awful.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.493
It's like a really bad place.
I'm in bed with some really bad people.

11:00.576 --> 11:01.952
You are not a bad person.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.206
No, I didn't say that I was a bad person.
I was saying that--

11:05.289 --> 11:08.042
Neither did I. I said you were not.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.629
I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep
getting hung up on this. I am so sorry.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.256
What can I do? How can I make it better?

11:14.340 --> 11:17.343
Well, I mean, you can come into the city
and take me for lunch.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.845
It'd be nice to see the face
of a decent human being.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.681
Oh, I wish that I could, but I'm, uh...

11:22.765 --> 11:25.768
I'm, uh, still at the vet
with Marianne's rabbit.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.478
<i>It's nice of you to take care of that.</i>

11:27.561 --> 11:28.437
[seat belt alert]

11:28.521 --> 11:29.814
What's that beeping sound?

11:30.106 --> 11:30.940
Um...

11:31.023 --> 11:32.692
[silent mouthing]

11:34.527 --> 11:37.321
The beeping?
They have Anastasia on a heart monitor.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.156
Jesus, is she going to be okay?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.283
-Yeah. They're being cautious.
<i>-Okay.</i>

11:41.367 --> 11:45.621
Well, I'm going to see you for drinks
with Nick before Marianne's play, right?

11:47.081 --> 11:47.915
[Ethan yells]

11:47.998 --> 11:49.083
[Sam screams]

11:49.166 --> 11:50.167
What's happening?

11:50.251 --> 11:55.548
Uh, shit's going down with a pit bull-
Rottweiler-Doberman-chow mix!

11:55.631 --> 11:58.717
<i>I've got to go, honey. This is crazy!</i>
<i>No, a dog is eating the cat!</i>

11:58.801 --> 12:00.845
<i>-It's straight-up cartoon shit.</i>
-Ethan!

12:00.928 --> 12:03.472
Everything's fine. Bye.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.015
What...

12:06.475 --> 12:07.852
[shouts] I don't give a fuck!

12:08.853 --> 12:09.979
Fuck you!

12:10.646 --> 12:11.939
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.024
[groans]

12:15.818 --> 12:18.738
[stammers] Marianne loved this rabbit.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.365
This might have been her best friend.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.492
-I'm her best friend!
-Okay. Good for you.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.328
She's still gonna be devastated.
You have to help me break the news to her.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.457
Are you crazy? We are not supposed
to be together. This is on you!

12:29.540 --> 12:30.666
What am I supposed to do?

12:32.585 --> 12:37.089
Return the body to Marianne and apologize.
That's what a good person would do.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.759
Or would a good person find an identical
rabbit to spare Marianne the pain?

12:40.843 --> 12:42.845
That's not good. It's covering your ass!

12:42.928 --> 12:45.306
Oh, that's right,
you got a C in moral reasoning.

12:45.389 --> 12:48.350
I'm covering both of our asses
and that's altruism.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.312
You're such a strict Kantian.
You know I'm relativistic!

12:51.395 --> 12:54.440
If I tell Marianne the truth,
it's going to blow up our lives!

12:54.523 --> 12:56.650
I don't like it! I don't like it.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.820
Every one of your fixes creates a new
problem. You're like a contractor!

12:59.904 --> 13:02.490
-And you lash out when you're at fault.
-I am aware!

13:06.076 --> 13:07.244
You're right.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.623
You're totally 100 percent right.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.710
We're going to tell Marianne the truth

13:14.793 --> 13:16.921
and return Anastasia's body.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.716
You're making me really nervous.
What's taking so long?

13:20.799 --> 13:24.428
Yeah, well, it's hard to dig a hole
with your bare hands. I don't have paws.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.681
-We've got to go!
-Okay! Alright!

13:33.062 --> 13:34.813
Okay. Alright.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.108
Goodbye. You were a great roommate.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.945
-Come on!
-Yes, alright!

13:45.407 --> 13:48.786
So what we're looking for is a rabbit
that looks just like that.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.705
-Oh, you're looking for a Hotot?
-Yes! A Hotot.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.874
There we go. There's the guy. Done.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.378
That's a New Zealand white.
Your rabbit looked about five pounds.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.130
This girl's going to fill out
to be ten, maybe 12 pounds.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.842
She gonna gain five pounds in the next
five hours? If not, I don't care.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.886
No.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.639
But she doesn't have the black rings
around her eyes.

14:08.722 --> 14:12.560
Very good! Hotots have characteristic
black rings around their eyes.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.144
We have no Hotots.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.605
We take the rabbit back,
then go to the play.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.233
-Yeah.
-Are you sure this mascara's okay?

14:19.316 --> 14:22.236
It's fine. That stuff was literally
tested on rabbits.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.613
-Jesus, Sam.
-You've already killed a rabbit.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.658
-We're past the cruelty-free conversation.
-You know what?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.160
-I don't know what I'm doing any more.
-It's fine.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.454
Marianne will never know the difference.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.124
Put it back in its cage
so you don't kill another one.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.042
Are you not concerned at all?

14:37.126 --> 14:39.837
[high-pitched] Of course I'm concerned!
We killed a bunny!

14:39.920 --> 14:44.091
I don't understand. What are we doing?
Have you ever cheated on somebody before?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.885
No! Of course not!

14:48.220 --> 14:50.514
-Have you?
-No! Ugh!

14:50.598 --> 14:52.641
What kind of person do you think I am?

14:53.350 --> 14:55.978
I don't understand what's going on.
What are we doing?

14:56.061 --> 14:56.896
I don't know.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.315
It's just... it's lasted for so long.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.191
When we started, it wasn't cheating.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.154
No, we were just two kids hooking up. You
were the second person I was ever with.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.449
It's like your vagina
is imprinted on my brain.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.456
-We're good people.
-We are such bad people.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.874
We're such bad people.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.251
Okay, Ethan just bailed on drinks.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.545
Ugh. He's a loser, anyway.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.173
-Yeah.
-Right?

15:24.256 --> 15:25.674
Screw that guy!

15:25.758 --> 15:27.509
Oh, God. This job.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.763
The people that I work with,
they're so terrible.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.681
They're evil people. They're evil.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.645
Well, on the bright side,
their kids will be fuck-ups like me.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.856
-What? Don't be so hard on yourself.
-What are you talking about?

15:40.940 --> 15:45.402
Look, it's not your fault
that you have a trust fund. Okay?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.615
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sort of the victim in this situation.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.867
-I wouldn't go that far.
-No, you're right.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.327
-No, listen.
-I am a victim.

15:53.410 --> 15:57.122
Listen, if I had a ton of money,
I wouldn't do anything, either.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.500
Thank you. That's not true.
I think you would.

15:59.583 --> 16:04.380
Because you're, like, the type of person
that has to have meaning in their life.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.174
-Ugh.
-You do, too, you just don't realize it

16:07.257 --> 16:11.053
because you're too busy sleeping
with a rotating harem of beautiful women

16:11.136 --> 16:12.972
-that are half your age.
-Okay.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.767
Okay. I find the term "rotating harem"
degrading.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.394
-Okay?
-But accurate.

16:19.061 --> 16:23.482
It's more of like a sexual mentorship,
for example.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.693
-What?
-Can we get two more scotches?

16:26.276 --> 16:27.319
Thank you.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.073
Ooh.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.075
Jesus.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.245
Hey, can I have one of those?

16:36.620 --> 16:38.706
Oh, I corrupted you.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.291
No, I am too old to be corrupted.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.960
Yeah, we'll see about that.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.548
Is that what you're wearing
to Marianne's play?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.633
Uh...

16:49.967 --> 16:51.760
You got a different idea?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.762
I might. I might just.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.472
I mean, it is opening night.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.266
We do kind of need to be fancy.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.726
-Fancy pantsy.
-Right?

16:59.018 --> 17:02.062
[Sam] Ugh. A little early. Thank God.

17:05.941 --> 17:07.943
[Ethan] Marianne's play better be good.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.739
A reverse-gender production of <i>Streetcar?</i>
What could be bad about that?

17:13.282 --> 17:14.283
[Sam sighs]

17:14.742 --> 17:15.743
[Ethan] Wow.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.831
-What a nightmare of a day.
-I know.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.459
So stressful.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.918
So stressed.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.796
My shoulders are, like, up to my ears.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.549
-I need a release.
-I know how you feel.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.552
I'm all, like, tense physically.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.679
I feel like I'm going to explode.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.896
[Ethan breathes deeply]

17:45.314 --> 17:46.899
-[Sam whispers] No.
-No.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.358
No, we can't.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.444
No. No, no, no, no.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.697
[amorous groaning]

17:59.369 --> 18:01.163
[Ethan] It's a button fly. Hold on.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.082
We should stop doing this.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.750
Right now.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.003
-Shit! Oh, God, shit!
-Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.507
Sorry to interrupt.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.676
-But it's illegal to have sex in public.
-We weren't having sex.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.929
I can see your wee-wee.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.098
-Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry. Is this public?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.891
Well, I can see you, so yes.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.768
Officer, are you going to arrest us?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.646
No. I'm going to write you up
for public fornication.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.731
Um... Um...

18:28.232 --> 18:30.943
Is there any way
that we could pay that fee right now?

18:31.026 --> 18:34.780
Nope. It's going to be mailed
and then you can pay it.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.826
Is there a way for you to not mail it?

18:38.909 --> 18:41.453
[Sam] Can you email us
the summons instead?

18:41.537 --> 18:43.664
Nope. It will definitely be mailed.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.959
Okay. Alright. [stammers]
And then when will that arrive?

18:47.042 --> 18:48.877
I live in a different borough, so--

18:48.961 --> 18:50.671
Do you want me to arrest you?

18:50.754 --> 18:52.923
-No.
-Would that be more convenient for you?

18:53.006 --> 18:55.384
-[Ethan] No, actually, mail's perfect.
-Perfect.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.887
Now, tell me this.
Was the matte black extra?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.849
Yeah, it was,
but I think it was worth it.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.225
Nice.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.479
-[Nick] My lady.
-[Lisa] Thank you, sir. Hi!

19:07.563 --> 19:09.773
-I thought I was going to be here alone.
-[Nick] We did.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.441
-[Lisa] We're here.
-Glad you made it.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.612
-We're ready. We're excited.
-I like your... I like your outfits.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.156
-[Nick] Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.408
-What are you wearing?
-It's a dress.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.869
-It's a night out on the town.
-Gotta be fancy.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.412
Are you guys drunk?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.330
-What?
-[Max] It's Monday night!

19:25.414 --> 19:27.249
-It's not.
-Says who?

19:28.458 --> 19:29.501
[Nick] Oh, wow.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.004
[Max] Is this the show?
Did the show start?

19:32.087 --> 19:34.423
[Nick] Is there a silent monologue? Wow!

19:35.424 --> 19:38.635
-Good luck, Marianne.
-[Nick] She's in character.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.847
I feel like you do this preparation
before you come on stage.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.642
-[Nick] Yes.
-[Lisa] I don't understand art.

19:45.726 --> 19:49.563
It's just the preamble here.
Now it's starting.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.231
[Lisa] It's happening.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.944
Feels like you would already
have that on stage.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.362
It could've started there, yeah.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.575
[actor giggles like a woman]

20:01.658 --> 20:04.328
This is about sisters.
This is like <i>Frozen</i>.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.414
Hey, sweetie. I'm sorry I'm late.
The vet took forever.

20:07.497 --> 20:12.002
It's okay. Everything's great. It's so
nice of you to take care of that bunny.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.921
Were you wearing this this morning?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.757
-I was not.
-Guys, we're trying to watch the play.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.592
[audience members shush]

20:18.675 --> 20:19.801
Oh, my God.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.305
-You married?
-I was.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.806
What happened?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.392
He... He died.

20:27.476 --> 20:30.854
-[Sam] Sorry, I got held up at work. Hi.
-Hi, Sam.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.649
-Good to see you, Sam.
-Likewise.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.151
So the guys are girls
and the girls are guys?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.152
Yes.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.112
[audience shushes]

20:39.196 --> 20:40.739
-You shush!
-Yeah, you shush.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.116
[Lisa] Whoa!

20:43.617 --> 20:44.868
[angrily] Pick it up!

20:44.952 --> 20:46.161
Pick it up!

20:46.245 --> 20:47.788
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.791
[shoes squeak]

20:53.043 --> 20:55.837
If they just walked normally,
they'd be less noticeable.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.173
I hope this part never ends.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.717
[slurring] Oh, hell.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.553
-Stay away from me. I mean it.
-Or what?

21:03.637 --> 21:04.471
[shoes squeak]

21:04.554 --> 21:06.932
It's the middle of the scene.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.685
-...rain down upon your head.
-[Marianne] Yeah. Let it!

21:09.768 --> 21:12.104
[Max] Why do they take such small steps?

21:12.187 --> 21:14.147
You want to play in the dirt, dirty girl?

21:14.231 --> 21:16.942
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.735
[actor gives high-pitched moans]

21:20.821 --> 21:23.156
I feel like typically,
the rape is implied.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.826
[Marianne yells]

21:25.909 --> 21:28.161
I mean, can guys even rape this long?

21:28.245 --> 21:31.707
I have no idea. And I don't know
why you'd ask me that question.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.083
Well, you're a guy.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.961
-Max, stop talking, she can see us.
-No, she can't.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.714
The lights are in her eyes
and we're in the dark.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.347
-Good job.
-What are you doing?

21:47.931 --> 21:51.018
-I don't know. She's looking at me.
-Say "good job" after the play.

21:51.101 --> 21:54.271
-Don't thumbs up her rape.
-Honey, I'm not thumb-upping the rape.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.149
-Is this still happening?
-Yes. Don't look.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.277
[audience cheers]

22:10.037 --> 22:11.246
[whistle blows]

22:13.415 --> 22:15.083
Are they...? Wow.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.335
That's probably it.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.885
You were both excellent in the show.
You should be on Broadway!

22:24.968 --> 22:28.263
Oh, thank you. I'm Frank Langella.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.849
I am also Frank Langella.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.434
It's all about a deal.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.685
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

22:33.769 --> 22:35.604
-[squeals]
-[all] Hey!

22:35.687 --> 22:37.564
-[Sam] We loved it.
-We loved it!

22:37.647 --> 22:39.107
[Max] Amazing!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.651
You were so good.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.237
Ethan, how did everything go
with Anastasia?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.531
Great! It went great!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.742
-She's alive and well.
-Thank you!

22:48.825 --> 22:50.786
-Yeah.
-Oh, good.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.497
Marianne, we have a half hour
to strike this set.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.540
Oh, God. Okay, I've got to go.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.085
Thanks for coming.<i> Namaste.</i>
See you guys later.

22:58.168 --> 23:02.506
Hey, thank you for saving
an otherwise horrible evening.

23:02.589 --> 23:04.883
You are more than welcome, my lady.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.760
-[Lisa] You're the best.
-[Nick] Any time.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.137
-[Lisa] You're the best.
-[Nick] Any time. I'm here.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.388
Goodbye, you guys!

23:10.472 --> 23:11.890
-Goodbye, guys!
-Bye!

23:13.350 --> 23:16.478
-I'm going to jump on the snack table.
-Let's get over there. What have they got?

23:16.561 --> 23:18.313
Bird for three!

23:19.231 --> 23:22.526
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry, bros. Super drunk right now.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.861
-[retching]
-Oh, honey.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.405
Do I make a beautiful bride?

23:27.489 --> 23:29.699
Yes, as beautiful as our wedding day.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.828
I did not have a very good first day.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.497
I do not like Blackstool.

23:36.456 --> 23:39.334
My phone. There's so many things!

23:39.418 --> 23:40.293
It's not working.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.129
[Ethan] I'll get it.
I'll plug it in for you.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.505
[Lisa groans]

23:43.588 --> 23:46.174
I'm really sorry
that I wasn't there for you today.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.302
-That's okay. Nick was.
-Oh, good. I'm glad.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.389
Marianne's apartment...

23:52.889 --> 23:55.100
looks a lot bigger when it's spinning.

23:55.183 --> 23:57.102
Let's get you out of these clothes.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.104
I want to go to sleep now.

23:59.187 --> 24:00.772
You're going to get cold.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.692
There we go. There we go.

24:03.775 --> 24:04.985
I love you.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.820
I love you, too.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.739
[sighs]

24:26.006 --> 24:27.257
[sighs heavily]

24:29.259 --> 24:30.510
[door opens]

24:32.304 --> 24:34.222
Hey. I thought you went to bed.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.975
No. Anastasia's acting really weird.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.602
Weird how?

24:39.394 --> 24:41.646
I don't know,
it's like she's another bunny.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.191
She's acting really lethargic.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.651
The vet gave her Vicodin.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.322
Bunny Vicodin. Yep.
And he said that might make her drowsy.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.824
I wish they hadn't done that.
I hate big pharma.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.826
Horrible.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.913
-Thanks so much for taking care of her.
-You're welcome.

24:58.496 --> 25:00.790
-You're a really good guy, Ethan.
-No.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.792
-You're the best.
-I am not the best.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.962
-You're the best.
-Literally the worst, so...

25:07.130 --> 25:09.216
-Night.
-Night. Good night, Anastasia.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.592
-Anastasia.
-Anastasia.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.970
["Don't Look Back In Anger" playing]

25:22.479 --> 25:23.897
[sighs]

25:27.901 --> 25:28.985
[message tone]

26:04.145 --> 26:06.356
[thunder claps]
