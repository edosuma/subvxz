[Christy and Bonnie gasping]

00:04.482 --> 00:06.615
Look, there are
its little fingers.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.834
One, two, three, four, five,
one, two, three, four, five.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.793
Yes!

00:10.880 --> 00:12.012
I can't wait till you're born!

00:12.099 --> 00:13.970
That's 'cause you don't have

00:14.057 --> 00:15.841
to squeeze it out
through your hoo-hah.

00:15.928 --> 00:18.148
So, Doc,
how we looking?

00:18.235 --> 00:20.455
Healthy kid, or is it
gonna need a crash helmet?

00:20.542 --> 00:22.239
Everything
looks great.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.936
You're right on schedule,
six weeks out.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.590
Hey, we might still

00:25.677 --> 00:27.984
be able to go to Senior Prom.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.899
Think you can watch the baby?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.118
You're joking,
right?

00:31.205 --> 00:33.207
The kid'll
still be wet.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.036
You're right.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.472
We'll bring it.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.651
These two are gonna
make great parents.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.174
I've seen
worse.

00:44.261 --> 00:46.524
Would you like
to know the sex?
Well...

00:46.611 --> 00:47.786
I think it's
pretty obvious.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.484
It's a boy and
he's going to be

00:49.571 --> 00:51.094
very popular
with the ladies.

00:51.181 --> 00:54.315
Actually, that's
the umbilical cord.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.925
Oh...
Oh...

00:56.012 --> 00:58.145
We'd like to know.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.146
Um, maybe not.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.756
How come?

01:00.843 --> 01:04.063
Knowing the sex makes
this all too... real.

01:04.150 --> 01:06.153
It's not real
enough for you?

01:06.240 --> 01:08.024
You've been farting
like a lumberjack.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.247
We don't really need
to know right now.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.075
Okay, I'll see you
again in ten days.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.164
Ooh, well...

01:17.251 --> 01:19.166
We've got a lot
to do to get

01:19.253 --> 01:20.819
the house ready
for our new guest.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.430
Guest?

01:22.517 --> 01:23.561
You make it sound like
we're just visiting.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.259
Well, a girl can hope.

01:28.697 --> 01:32.614
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

01:42.406 --> 01:43.320
Thanks for helping
out, Baxter.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.495
My pleasure.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.018
Always happy when my van is used

01:46.106 --> 01:48.499
to transport legal stuff.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.458
What else you
got in there?

01:50.545 --> 01:53.200
Amigos.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.551
Uno momento,
por favor.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.816
Seriously?

02:00.903 --> 02:03.035
You're moving
illegal aliens?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.820
Don't be
ridiculous.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.778
They're
drug mules.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.042
What's going on?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.783
Your grandmother
and I got you a crib.

02:11.870 --> 02:12.871
What do you think?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.960
Looks like
a little cage.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.136
It is a
little cage.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.050
Mom.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.487
When your mother
was an infant,

02:19.574 --> 02:21.184
I kept her in
a cat carrier.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.013
Well, whatever.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.319
I don't like it.

02:25.406 --> 02:28.496
Okay, you're
welcome.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.195
Was I that grumpy
when I was pregnant?

02:32.282 --> 02:34.502
Oh-ho-ho, I am not
falling for that.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.069
Good day,
madam.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.767
Thanks, Baxter.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.160
I'm gonna make some tea,
you want some?

02:40.247 --> 02:42.031
What I want is a daughter

02:42.118 --> 02:45.382
who is a little bit excited
about having a baby.

02:45.469 --> 02:47.428
Oh, you got to cut her
some slack, she's scared.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.604
Yeah, I get
that, but...

02:49.691 --> 02:50.953
we're in the
home stretch

02:51.040 --> 02:52.998
and she is in
complete denial.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.653
You know, she bought
a tube top the other day.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.134
I do not want to see that.

03:00.919 --> 03:01.790
I know she's young,

03:01.877 --> 03:03.444
I know she's scared,

03:03.531 --> 03:04.488
but come on, it's not like

03:04.575 --> 03:06.098
she's doing
this alone.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.231
What if we threw her
a baby shower?

03:08.318 --> 03:09.841
Let her see we're all
in this together?

03:09.928 --> 03:11.234
Wow.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.888
That's not
a bad idea.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.064
You know, invite some
friends from school,

03:15.151 --> 03:17.197
eat cake, play games...

03:17.284 --> 03:21.505
all the things I wish
somebody did for me.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.334
I am really sorry.

03:24.421 --> 03:27.337
It just... it kills me
that I wasn't there for you.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.860
Wow.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.558
I didn't expect you
to cop to it.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.081
I'm not copping
to anything.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.649
It's just the quickest
way to shut you up.

03:34.736 --> 03:35.563
Mom! Grandma!

03:35.650 --> 03:38.087
Look, I'm in jail!

03:40.655 --> 03:42.178
I'd laugh if I didn't think
it was a real possibility.

03:48.402 --> 03:52.536
All right, make sure the oil
in the deep fryer is changed,

03:52.623 --> 03:55.278
and I want the walk-in
cleaned from top to bottom.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.280
And I could do
without the look.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.762
Uh, hey, Chef Rudy,
you got a minute?

04:00.849 --> 04:01.893
Oh, make it quick.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.330
I'm sleeping with a food critic,

04:03.417 --> 04:05.636
and he throws a hissy fit
if I'm late.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.291
Wait, when did you start eating

04:08.378 --> 04:10.641
from the other side
of the buffet?

04:10.728 --> 04:13.992
When I realized there was
a four-star review in his pants.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.430
What do
you need?

04:16.517 --> 04:18.214
Well, I'm throwing a baby shower
for my daughter, and I...

04:18.301 --> 04:20.911
Speak quickly. I'm bored.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.697
And I'm kind of
strapped for cash,

04:22.784 --> 04:24.438
so I was hoping you could
hook me up with some food.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.092
You want me to help you
steal from the restaurant?

04:27.179 --> 04:29.269
Just the stuff that's left over.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.271
That's the stuff
I usually steal.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.664
Oh, come on.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.187
All right.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.145
Lucky for you,
I need an empty stomach

04:36.232 --> 04:38.278
for what I'm about to do.

04:41.193 --> 04:45.285
But, um, how does a-- ah--

04:45.372 --> 04:47.112
a shrimp platter, carpaccio,
and, uh-- ah--

04:47.199 --> 04:49.289
crème brûlée sound?

04:49.376 --> 04:50.290
Oh. Thank you.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.466
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.729
Don't... don't confuse
my naughty parts.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.387
I have to go ride
a 300-pound Frenchman.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.262
Wow, you scored.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.178
Yeah, Rudy really
came through.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.789
Did you know that
he swung both ways?

05:11.876 --> 05:13.791
No, but when we slept together,

05:13.878 --> 05:14.923
he did ask me to do a few things

05:15.010 --> 05:16.751
that were a little suspect.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.929
It does make me nervous,

05:21.016 --> 05:23.540
having to beg food
for a baby shower.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.063
I mean, how are we
gonna make ends meet

05:25.150 --> 05:26.064
when the kid actually gets here?

05:26.151 --> 05:27.762
Well, that's a tough one.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.329
Maybe you could get
a second job.

05:33.724 --> 05:37.206
Or maybe you could get
a first one.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.469
What are you talking about?

05:39.556 --> 05:40.949
I have my life coaching
business.

05:41.036 --> 05:43.647
Oh, please,
you've had two clients.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.257
One paid you with used luggage

05:45.345 --> 05:48.217
and the other one stepped
in front of a train.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.350
That did teach me
to get paid in advance.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.617
I really need you
to pitch in, Mom.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.140
All right,
all right.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.620
Maybe I'll open my
law practice again.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.143
You're not a lawyer!

06:01.230 --> 06:03.363
Well, I wasn't a health
inspector either,

06:03.450 --> 06:04.494
but restaurants paid
me a lot of money

06:04.581 --> 06:06.714
to look the
other way.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.677
Typing
skills?

06:13.764 --> 06:15.723
Two fingers.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.248
This one.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.381
And, oddly enough, this one.

06:23.339 --> 06:26.168
Aha.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.343
Excel?

06:27.430 --> 06:30.128
At what?

06:30.215 --> 06:32.870
The computer program
called Excel.

06:32.957 --> 06:33.915
Of course.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.960
Yes, love me some Excel.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.659
How are your phone skills?

06:38.746 --> 06:40.138
Let me see.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.139
Hello?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.314
[clicks tongue]

06:42.402 --> 06:45.317
I think you have your answer.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.017
How about a 52-line PBX system
with direct inward calling?

06:49.104 --> 06:50.540
That's what I'm talkin' about.

06:50.627 --> 06:53.456
While I'm typing.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.466
All right.

07:03.553 --> 07:04.946
Thanks for coming in.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.426
We'll contact you
if anything comes up.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.253
Oh, that doesn't sound
very encouraging.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.690
Ms. Plunkett...

07:09.777 --> 07:11.300
You see these résumés?

07:11.387 --> 07:13.084
These are all people
with advanced degrees

07:13.171 --> 07:14.956
and I can't
find them work.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.827
They sit in that box until
I bring them home to Mother

07:16.914 --> 07:18.438
so she can do her
sudoku on the back.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.309
Well, maybe the problem is...

07:20.396 --> 07:22.354
Wait, you live with your mother?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.226
I have my own entrance.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.186
Uh, let me ask you...

07:28.273 --> 07:30.406
this employment agency deal,

07:30.493 --> 07:31.799
this isn't what
you really wanted

07:31.886 --> 07:32.669
to do with your life, is it?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.410
[scoffs]
God, no.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.415
I wanted to write
a Broadway musical.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.503
Interesting.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.504
What stopped you?

07:41.591 --> 07:45.073
It's really hard.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.295
That's not it.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.732
What stopped you is

07:51.819 --> 07:53.342
you had no one guiding you,

07:53.429 --> 07:55.649
no one encouraging you.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.999
Well, Mother tries,

07:58.086 --> 07:59.740
but ever since the stroke,

07:59.827 --> 08:02.177
she's got her own problems.

08:03.657 --> 08:05.310
I can help.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.573
You can?
Mm-hmm.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.052
I didn't want to say anything

08:08.139 --> 08:09.967
because it's
intimidating to people,

08:10.054 --> 08:11.316
but I'm a certified life coach.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.883
Really?
Mm-hmm.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.363
Where did you get
your certification?

08:14.450 --> 08:17.845
The Katzenjammer
Life Coaching Institute

08:17.932 --> 08:19.890
in Geneva, Switzerland.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.634
Wow.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.549
I don't want to
give you false hope,

08:26.636 --> 08:28.420
but I've had a tremendous amount
of success with composers.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.945
Really? Like who?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.207
You know Andrew Lloyd Webber?

08:32.294 --> 08:33.121
[gasps] I do.

08:33.207 --> 08:34.251
You're welcome.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.253
Wow.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.254
Before
I came along,

08:36.341 --> 08:37.908
Evita was singing,

08:37.995 --> 08:40.476
"Don't cry for me, West Covina."

08:42.304 --> 08:43.653
Amazing.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.437
So... so... so
how do we do this?

08:45.525 --> 08:46.569
Well, um...

08:46.656 --> 08:48.092
I, uh... oh!

08:48.179 --> 08:50.007
I've got an opening
Wednesday night at 8:00.

08:50.094 --> 08:54.098
Ooh, Wednesdays
Mother and I watch Idol.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.100
Are you listening to yourself?

08:56.187 --> 08:58.886
Those people on American Idol
are chasing greatness.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.757
All you're doing
is watching them.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.498
Sometimes I vote.

09:06.894 --> 09:07.459
I'll see you
Wednesday.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.635
Um...

09:08.722 --> 09:10.724
do I get some kind of discount

09:10.811 --> 09:11.855
if I pre-pay for
a bunch of sessions?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.944
Do you have the cash on you now?

09:14.031 --> 09:14.989
No.Then no.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.688
And that's how it's done.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.562
[door opens]

09:22.649 --> 09:25.347
Hey.
Hey.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.088
What you got going on there?

09:27.175 --> 09:29.003
I'm making a little
princess tiara

09:29.090 --> 09:30.613
for Violet to wear
at her baby shower.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.659
Aw, it's so precious
when you overcompensate

09:32.746 --> 09:36.706
for being a drunken loser
when she was a kid.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.534
How does it work?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.581
Do you just sense when
I'm feeling good about myself?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.104
I'm sorry.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.279
This is so sweet.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.933
Thank you.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.499
I just want to give my
daughter the best day ever.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.979
Well, how about

09:49.066 --> 09:50.241
I give my daughter
the best day ever?

09:50.328 --> 09:52.461
I just got a
paying client.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.984
Shut up.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.551
Yep. A real
Norman Bates.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.512
I think his mother might
actually be stuffed.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.037
Hey.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.691
Honey, look,
I'm making you a tiara.

10:04.778 --> 10:08.608
Nice. Listen, I decided
I don't want to have a party.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.088
What are you talking about?

10:11.175 --> 10:12.960
It's a celebration!

10:13.047 --> 10:15.658
It's fun and games and
free stuff for the baby.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.268
I don't need it.

10:17.355 --> 10:19.967
Sweetheart, I'm stealing food
from the restaurant.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.795
Believe me, we need it.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.753
No, we don't.

10:23.840 --> 10:29.019
Okay. May I ask why?

10:29.106 --> 10:31.631
I decided to give
the baby up for adoption.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.215
I feel like someone
just punched me in the heart.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.523
Did not see that coming.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.703
Damn it,
this is ridiculous!

11:00.790 --> 11:01.661
No, Christy, wait.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.053
No, no, no. She's wrong.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.620
I am not gonna let this happen.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.753
We need to talk about this.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.537
There's nothing
to talk about.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.973
The hell there isn't!
Look, I know you're scared.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.583
I'd be worried about
you if you weren't,

11:11.671 --> 11:13.324
but that's no reason to
give up on this baby.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.499
Christy, calm down.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.892
Do not tell me to calm down!

11:15.979 --> 11:19.330
Why? Tell me why
you're doing this.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.941
That's my business.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.246
No, it's not!

11:22.333 --> 11:23.030
We're all in this together.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.205
Now tell me!

11:24.292 --> 11:28.122
Okay. I don't want to be you.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.255
You're talking
to your mother, right?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.257
I'm talking to both of you.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.172
You had her when
you were my age,

11:35.259 --> 11:37.871
you had me when you were my age.
I do the same thing,

11:37.958 --> 11:39.699
I'm gonna wind up with the same
wasted life as you.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.833
You think I wasted my life?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.096
Mom, you're a 35-year-old
ex-alcoholic,

11:46.183 --> 11:47.576
you're all alone,
and you're waiting tables.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.534
I'm a certified
life coach.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.623
Oh, give it a rest.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.539
Hey, first of all, I
happen to like my life

11:54.626 --> 11:57.412
and I love my children
and I love my job.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.413
What about me?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.849
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.633
So don't tell me
I wasted my life!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.505
Okay. I just mean
that I want more.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.637
I want to go to school,
I want a career!

12:05.725 --> 12:06.682
You can still have
all of those things.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.467
Wait. Let me finish.

12:09.554 --> 12:12.949
And I want this baby to have
a chance at all of that, too.

12:14.690 --> 12:15.691
Wow.

12:20.130 --> 12:21.871
I don't know what to say.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.133
Excuse me.

12:25.701 --> 12:28.617
I am doing the right thing.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.401
I did not say a word.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.405
Well, will you please talk
to her?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.017
Of course.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.891
What does Luke say about this?

12:43.893 --> 12:45.852
He doesn't know yet.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.636
Really?

12:47.723 --> 12:49.681
You have any advice?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.906
Maybe I'm not a life coach.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.965
Crème brûlée?

13:12.052 --> 13:12.704
Thanks.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.841
I really want a
drink right now.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.800
Shut up.
You got pudding.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.324
If she's gonna put that
baby up for adoption,

13:23.411 --> 13:24.934
I'll adopt it.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.328
Oh, that won't make things
awkward at Thanksgiving.

13:27.415 --> 13:30.200
"Violet, honey,
please pass the peas
to your sister-daughter."

13:31.636 --> 13:33.116
You don't understand.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.771
This was supposed to be
our... do-over baby.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.905
Do-over baby?

13:38.992 --> 13:41.995
Yeah...

13:42.082 --> 13:44.649
a chance to get things right.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.261
You know, to fix all
the mistakes you made.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.784
What about all the mistakes
you made?

13:48.871 --> 13:50.699
I made them because of you!

13:50.786 --> 13:52.919
I was abandoned
by my mother

13:53.006 --> 13:54.268
and thrown
into the foster system.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.269
Who do I get to blame?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.923
Do not play that card.

13:57.010 --> 13:57.749
Why not? It's my best card.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.623
Just forget about us.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.016
Have you ever stopped
to think about

14:03.103 --> 14:04.191
what life
is gonna be like

14:04.278 --> 14:05.888
if Violet does keep
this baby?

14:05.975 --> 14:07.455
Of course I have.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.064
Really?

14:08.151 --> 14:10.806
Yeah!

14:10.893 --> 14:12.808
As long as we're together,

14:12.895 --> 14:14.897
as long as we're family,
it's gonna be great.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.507
Oh, get honest.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.467
15, 20 years from now,
how's it really gonna look?

14:23.079 --> 14:26.039
Mom, let's go!
I'm gonna be late for work!

14:26.126 --> 14:27.736
[toilet flushes]

14:29.738 --> 14:33.785
[groans]
Sorry.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.876
Things did notgo well in there.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.444
Mom, let's go!

14:40.531 --> 14:42.359
We're gonna be late
for our AA meeting.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.622
I don't want to go!

14:44.709 --> 14:46.320
I want to get a quart
of vodka, an eight ball,

14:46.407 --> 14:48.888
take out my teeth, and
gum a couple of sailors.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.672
[laughs]

14:50.759 --> 14:53.240
I said on your birthday.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.285
Now move it.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.940
Don't forget you're taking your
granddaughter to school today.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.376
I know.

14:59.463 --> 15:00.900
Come on, angel, we're leaving!

15:00.987 --> 15:03.903
I can't go to school.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.644
My water broke.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.517
You sure you didn't
just wet yourself?

15:09.604 --> 15:11.998
'Cause the Crypt-Keeper
over here does it all the time.

15:15.131 --> 15:18.265
All right, let's go
to the hospital.

15:18.352 --> 15:22.443
Is this one gonna be
the do-over baby?

15:22.530 --> 15:22.922
[laughs]

15:25.141 --> 15:27.230
You want me to take away
your oxygen?

15:27.317 --> 15:27.927
You want me to?!

15:28.014 --> 15:29.798
Come on!

15:34.934 --> 15:37.849
Roscoe, we're leaving!

15:43.246 --> 15:46.728
Hey! Who's gonna take me
to my parole hearing?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.428
Well?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.345
I got to go talk
to my daughter.

15:55.432 --> 15:58.609
You're not gonna finish
your crème brûlée?

15:58.696 --> 15:59.959
God, no.

16:04.833 --> 16:05.965
You got a minute?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.576
Not if you're gonna yell at me.

16:08.663 --> 16:12.536
No, no more yelling.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.103
I just...

16:14.190 --> 16:16.976
I want to apologize
for being selfish.

16:17.063 --> 16:20.457
I like where you're going.

16:20.544 --> 16:25.114
I was looking at your baby as a
way to make up for the mistakes

16:25.201 --> 16:26.724
I made with you and Roscoe.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.378
How would that work?

16:28.465 --> 16:33.035
Uh, you know, this time
I wouldn't be drunk,

16:33.122 --> 16:35.429
I wouldn't pass out
at a PTA meeting...

16:35.516 --> 16:37.387
at the wrong school.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.130
Yeah, that wasn't
too embarrassing.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.830
And I was excited
for the new baby, you know?

16:45.917 --> 16:48.137
Fresh out of the wrapper.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.834
Kind of a do-over.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.880
That is so messed up.

16:51.967 --> 16:55.971
What's really messed up
is that I didn't realize

16:56.058 --> 16:58.104
you are my do-over baby.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.757
I am?

16:59.844 --> 17:02.064
[sighs]

17:02.151 --> 17:07.069
Violet, you're
breaking the cycle.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.853
You're gonna have
a better life than me,

17:08.940 --> 17:13.684
and you're making sure
that this baby has one, too.

17:13.771 --> 17:17.297
I've been doing
some research online,

17:17.384 --> 17:19.820
and there's a lot of great
couples that really want

17:19.907 --> 17:21.910
to start a family but can't.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.217
You already found people?Yeah.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.306
Look at these two guys
in San Francisco.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.004
Mike's a hedge fund trader
and André's a choreographer.

17:29.091 --> 17:32.225
Oh, my God,
look at their house.

17:32.312 --> 17:35.010
Think they'd adopt
a 35-year-old waitress?

17:35.097 --> 17:38.361
You know,
me and the baby,
kind of a twofer?

17:38.448 --> 17:39.145
[laughs]

17:39.232 --> 17:41.451
I love you.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.279
I love you, too.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.283
[taps key]

17:47.370 --> 17:50.025
Aw, look, they have
a teacup poodle.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
Big surprise.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.863
Okay, we've made some
real progress tonight.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.256
You think?

18:03.343 --> 18:04.518
Oh, yeah. You've got
a central character

18:04.605 --> 18:06.041
and premise
for your musical.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.999
You don't think
the story's a turnoff?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.132
No! A 40-year-old man who sleeps
in the same bed with his mother

18:10.219 --> 18:12.003
is gonna speak
to a lot of people.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.529
Well, it's like you said,

18:15.616 --> 18:17.966
write what you know.

18:18.053 --> 18:19.446
Next session,
I expect to hear

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
a verse and chorus
for "Spooning Mama."

18:21.230 --> 18:24.407
Hello.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.844
Ah, my next client,
right on time. Come on in.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.237
She's a genius.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.805
Without her,
I wouldn't be a waitress.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.201
Ooh!

18:35.288 --> 18:38.117
Wow, he really believes
you're a life coach.

18:38.204 --> 18:39.944
Well, why wouldn't he?

18:40.031 --> 18:41.859
The Louisiana State Bar
believed I was an attorney.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.166
I had three wins
before I had to skedaddle.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.822
Where's Violet?

18:47.909 --> 18:50.041
She went to talk to Luke
and his parents.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.479
Oh, yeah, right.

18:52.566 --> 18:56.570
You know, I've
been thinking.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.137
If you're jonesing for a baby,

18:58.224 --> 18:59.094
you could
probably still pop one out.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.227
Yeah, I guess so.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.751
Just have to meet the right guy.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.275
You sure? That didn't stop you
the first two times.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.672
Dumb-ass crackers!

19:11.759 --> 19:12.586
What's the matter?

19:12.673 --> 19:13.761
Luke's parents.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.545
First they don't want a thing

19:15.632 --> 19:17.199
to do with this baby,
and now they're freaking out

19:17.286 --> 19:17.939
because I'm giving up
their beloved grandkid.

19:18.026 --> 19:18.809
What about Luke?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.507
He was useless.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.987
Oh, and get this.
Now his parents are insisting

19:23.074 --> 19:24.685
that they're going
to adopt the baby.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.469
What'd you tell them?

19:26.556 --> 19:28.689
I told them that I don't want
my kid being raised

19:28.776 --> 19:31.996
by religious fanatics.
I want it raised by homosexuals!

19:36.479 --> 19:38.438
You know,
if they take her to court,

19:38.525 --> 19:40.309
she's gonna need
a good lawyer.
No!
