- We need the core.

- This cure is not a memory.
- There is no cure.

Elena, what are you doing here?

00:21.063 --> 00:23.395

It wasn't safe.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.255
Contrary to what you may have heard,

02:14.384 --> 02:18.627
Colonel Foster
did not find a cure to the plague.

02:21.224 --> 02:25.843
This is the 2033 mutation of the virus,

02:25.979 --> 02:30.018
a second iteration
of the original plague.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.564
Foster's basing his research
on the first mutation,

02:34.696 --> 02:35.902
not the current one.

02:36.031 --> 02:40.821
But the virus has mutated
twice more since 2033.

02:40.952 --> 02:45.036
Now it is an entirely unique
microorganism,

02:45.165 --> 02:48.202
something quite alien.

Something we'll probably
never fully understand.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.550
Because it gives his people hope,

03:02.683 --> 03:06.301
just as it gave you.

03:06.436 --> 03:11.681
So that his obsession to find a cure,
his work, can continue.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.814
Our mission is paramount.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.527
Mr Cole is lost in time,

03:20.659 --> 03:25.403

unless we can power our machine.

Foster lied to you.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.331
Jones said that it's all bullshit.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.200
He cured the wrong virus.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.537
He was a buddy of ours.

He wasn't a buddy. He was just a guy
we ran with. The guy was an asshole.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.093
He got caught by militia.

- They interrogated him.
- They tried to. (LAUGHS)

- It was a coffin.
- Yes, exactly.

33:58.245 --> 34:00.110
I don't know if I can.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.664
You can.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.664
You will.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.034
No matter what I do, you always die.

34:11.508 --> 34:13.590
See you soon.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.389
Cassie?

34:53.133 --> 34:54.919
(SOBS)

35:06.730 --> 35:08.186
(FLICKS SWITCH)

35:10.483 --> 35:11.859
(FLICKS SWITCH)

35:11.985 --> 35:14.442
(BANGING)

35:15.572 --> 35:18.188
(WHIRRING)

35:38.720 --> 35:39.835
(SLIGHT BOOM)

35:46.269 --> 35:47.475
(SLIGHT BOOM)

36:04.287 --> 36:08.621
(WHIRRING INTENSIFIES)

36:08.750 --> 36:10.081
(GROANS)

36:13.004 --> 36:14.995
(WHIRRING STOPS)

36:15.924 --> 36:17.255
James.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.586
I thought you were gone forever.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.879
I watched it happen all over again...

36:25.934 --> 36:27.265
...2017.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.218
The plague.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.604
I lost her.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.370
(PUNCH THROWN)

36:50.375 --> 36:52.081
RAMSE: Cole, what are you doing?

36:53.837 --> 36:55.873
Pack your bags, man. We're leaving.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.045
Here.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.629
What if she's telling the truth?

37:08.393 --> 37:12.102
- Are you kidding? That's crazy, man.
- What if it's not?

37:12.230 --> 37:16.394
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- We got no gear. Winter's coming.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.728
Just sack up. We'll be fine.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.729
Listen, West Seven's
not going to find us.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.357
We're safe. We have food.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.074
Jackpot

37:27.954 --> 37:29.114
Hey...

37:31.082 --> 37:35.041
- What are you doing?
- Me and you... we've done things, OK?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.455
I made my peace with it.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.079
Have you?

37:39.215 --> 37:41.592
Ramse, don't...

37:41.718 --> 37:44.835
Florida is not going to fix this.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.632
It's not.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.881
What are you doing, man?

37:49.017 --> 37:52.180
Hear me out.
I know she's got a screw loose.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.724
She's a nut job.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.230
But what if she's telling the truth?

37:57.358 --> 37:59.144
What if it works?

38:00.528 --> 38:03.520
You got to take that shot.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.527
You need this.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.533
You're insane.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.116
I'm leaving with or without you.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.707
(GUNSHOT)

38:19.881 --> 38:21.337
What are you doing?

38:22.425 --> 38:24.211
SOLDIER: Stop! Put down your weapon.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.048
Saving your soul, brother.

38:31.184 --> 38:32.674
Saving your soul.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.974
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

38:48.827 --> 38:52.536
RAMSE: Hell of lot's happened
since you've been gone, brother.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.286
I know.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.073
I heard everything.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.121
Then you know what she did, right?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.249
She did what she had to.

39:02.382 --> 39:06.000
She murdered half of Spearhead.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.382
They had a cure.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.465
She lied to us, man.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.106
You with her on this?

39:22.235 --> 39:24.977
The mission's all that matters now.

39:30.285 --> 39:33.152
- Where you going?
- Where do you think I'm going?

39:33.288 --> 39:36.030
- I won't let you hurt her.
- You won't let me?

39:39.002 --> 39:40.492
What are you gonna do?

39:42.797 --> 39:44.458
What are you gonna do, Cole?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.336
lfound Elena.

39:53.933 --> 39:58.051
She was living there... Spearhead.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.100
She's got a kid.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.816
My kid.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.606
Jesus, man, I'm sorry.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.522
Oh, you're... you're sorry?

40:10.658 --> 40:11.909
That's nice.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.952
This ain't working.

40:17.373 --> 40:20.911
It's not working.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.458
You gotta stop.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.297
I can't. I won't.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.802
I watched the world die, Ramse.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.182
Everyone.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.435
I watched her die.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.150
It's meant to happen, brother.

40:49.238 --> 40:50.774
She's always gonna die.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.317
Hey, don't...

40:55.620 --> 40:57.281
Don't say that.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.285
Don't say that.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.293
You think you're saving people? Hmm?

41:07.173 --> 41:09.255
You do, don't you?

41:11.052 --> 41:13.293
You're not erasing anyone.

41:15.890 --> 41:20.384
This has got to stop.
I mean... we're done.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.385
You don't get to make that call.

41:22.522 --> 41:23.807
Oh?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.848
West Seven all over again, huh?

41:30.029 --> 41:31.360
You're willing to do anything?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.480
I'm not going to let her die, Ramse.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.449
There he is. That's the Cole I know.

41:39.372 --> 41:43.536
You're blind, and you're selfish.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.373
What about me?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.587
What about you, Ramse?

41:49.716 --> 41:51.206
What about you?

41:52.343 --> 41:54.049
My son.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.385
Your son's already dead.

42:05.606 --> 42:07.562
There is no future.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.444
Get it through your head.
