01:08.803 --> 01:10.237
Gotcha!

01:35.262 --> 01:36.463
Ow!

01:46.340 --> 01:48.241
What a smell!

02:00.253 --> 02:02.389
I think we are about
to get real close.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.473
<i>People have</i>
<i>taken to the streets</i>

02:19.507 --> 02:20.541
<i>in desperation.</i>

02:20.575 --> 02:23.243
<i>Some have come out</i>
<i>today to protest,</i>

02:23.276 --> 02:25.412
<i>while others are taking</i>
<i>advantage of the chaos</i>

02:25.445 --> 02:26.781
<i>to loot nearby houses and shops.</i>

02:30.384 --> 02:32.352
<i>I was home when</i>
<i>they broke down the door.</i>

02:32.386 --> 02:34.689
<i>They took everything</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

02:34.722 --> 02:37.257
<i>even the goddamn</i>
<i>food in the fridge.</i>

02:45.533 --> 02:47.969
<i>It seems that fear</i>
<i>has become more contagious</i>

02:48.002 --> 02:49.604
<i>than the virus itself.</i>

05:30.531 --> 05:32.767
Where is it?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.467
Where is the bottle?

05:34.502 --> 05:35.703
No, you've had enough!

05:35.736 --> 05:37.805
Ow!

05:37.839 --> 05:40.440
Where's Jane?

05:40.473 --> 05:41.642
I'm looking for her.

05:41.676 --> 05:42.910
Huh?

05:42.944 --> 05:44.411
No, please, no.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.580
Leave her alone.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.449
Jane?

05:49.482 --> 05:50.483
Open the door.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.687
I know you're in there.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.121
Come on!

05:54.155 --> 05:56.423
Open up!

05:56.456 --> 05:57.091
Will you stop it?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.526
Leave her alone.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.628
Just leave <i>us</i> alone!

06:00.661 --> 06:02.630
- Shut up!
- Ow!

06:02.663 --> 06:04.565
Ow!

06:30.157 --> 06:31.424
It's all right, Jane.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.460
You've done so well.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.030
That's enough for today, okay?

06:36.063 --> 06:37.965
I'll see you again next week.

06:37.999 --> 06:38.833
Good work.

06:49.110 --> 06:53.614
Could you write me a new
prescription for my pills?

06:53.648 --> 06:54.849
If I remember correctly,

06:54.882 --> 06:57.450
you should have enough
for two more weeks.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.452
I think I lost them

06:59.486 --> 07:02.023
when I was getting out
of the car, probably.

07:02.056 --> 07:03.190
Good.

07:03.224 --> 07:05.458
You know, I think it's time
we started weening you off

07:05.492 --> 07:06.861
of them anyway,

07:06.894 --> 07:09.063
especially with the
progress you've made today.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.231
What do you mean alright?

07:10.264 --> 07:11.732
Look at this.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.567
It could be so much worse.

07:15.703 --> 07:17.939
How are things going
in your personal life?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.508
Fine.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.143
We're texting.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.611
We're going to have a date.

07:28.683 --> 07:31.052
Okay, I'll write you
the prescription.

07:31.085 --> 07:33.988
But again, I repeat,
these pills are not magic.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.564
The solution to your problems
lies on the other side

07:43.597 --> 07:45.199
of your fears, Jane.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.667
<i>Law</i>
<i>enforcement cracked down</i>

07:46.701 --> 07:49.637
<i>on unauthorized demonstrations</i>
<i>today as more and more people</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:52.573
<i>joined the protests against</i>
<i>a possible quarantine.</i>

07:52.606 --> 07:54.742
<i>The public is growing</i>
<i>increasingly dissatisfied</i>

07:54.775 --> 07:56.811

07:56.844 --> 07:58.746
<i>In light of these</i>
<i>recent protests,</i>

07:58.779 --> 08:00.247
<i>the government has</i>
<i>decided to halt-</i> -

08:01.248 --> 08:03.250
- Hey, let's go.
- End Quarantine!

08:03.284 --> 08:05.519
- Let's go, let's go.
- End isolation!

08:05.553 --> 08:07.221
- We demand freedom!
- End isolation!

08:07.254 --> 08:09.290
-We want our rights.
-We want our rights.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.291
-End quarantine.
-We want our freedom.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.926
-End quarantine.
-No isolation!

08:11.959 --> 08:14.628
-End isolation.
-We have our freedoms.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.597
-We want our rights.
-We want our rights.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.265
-We want our rights back.
-We want our freedom.

08:18.299 --> 08:19.266

You got yourself a

09:45.786 --> 09:47.888

09:47.922 --> 09:49.723
Candlelit dinner.

personal invitation, yeah?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.836
What about the
quarantine, you know?

10:01.869 --> 10:04.271
Well, if you give
me my power back,

10:04.305 --> 10:05.773
you'll have your coffee.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.775
- You got it.
- Hm.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.709
Give me your number.

'cause half the city's lost
power in the storm, you know?

10:16.016 --> 10:17.685
No, no, please, I'm begging you.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.254
I really need it
right now, urgently.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.691
'Cause I have no lights, no
power, no signal, nothing.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.793
-I'm dying, really.
-Oh, wow.

10:25.826 --> 10:28.195
It sounds like we got a real
apocalypse on our hands.

10:28.229 --> 10:29.830
Exactly.

10:29.864 --> 10:32.133
So, where's this charming
little place anyway?

10:32.166 --> 10:34.735
Um, it's not so far from here.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.741
All right then.

10:41.809 --> 10:42.743
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.098
Get outta here!

11:46.541 --> 11:49.310
Surprise!

11:49.343 --> 11:51.078
Happy birthday, girl.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.847
What's the matter?

11:53.881 --> 11:55.282
Worried we're contagious?

11:55.316 --> 11:56.750
Um, I'm fine.

11:56.784 --> 12:00.321
I just, I wasn't expecting
to see anyone today.

12:00.354 --> 12:01.523
Oh, come on.

12:01.556 --> 12:03.090
Relax a little.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.825

12:04.858 --> 12:07.061

12:07.094 --> 12:09.396
Who's ready to fuckin' party?

12:09.430 --> 12:12.299
All these forest beasts
better be ready for a show!

12:14.335 --> 12:15.169
Yeah.

12:16.804 --> 12:17.805
So, what?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.840
Are you we just
gonna stand here?

12:19.873 --> 12:20.808
Sweet cave.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.777
Oh, yeah, but the signal's dead.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.981
Oh, I think we got just
the man to help us.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.282
Right, Ray?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.451
- Yeah!
- Happy birthday, Jane.

12:30.484 --> 12:31.785
Yeah.

12:31.819 --> 12:32.853
Hm.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.824
Actually, this wasn't the way

12:36.857 --> 12:39.059

it wasn't a good idea.

And now I'm still
getting used to it.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.876
Hm, maybe that was
because you're lonely.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.312
Why do you think so?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.982
Your Instagram posts.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.317

13:37.418 --> 13:39.186
I need them to

So, this is where
all your wax masterpieces

come from?

13:46.561 --> 13:49.163
Not masterpieces, just candles.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.598
Can you show me?

13:50.632 --> 13:52.900
Now it's a bit messy inside,

13:52.933 --> 13:55.603
but I think I can
show you something.

Oh, wow.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.993
That's beautiful.

14:20.027 --> 14:20.662
And it smells good, too.

- Try.

Hm, not so bad.

15:54.087 --> 15:54.689
You better
leave tomorrow.

16:14.809 --> 16:16.009
What?

16:16.043 --> 16:17.277
Hair of the dog.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.179
Looks like you're trying
to keep the party going.

16:19.213 --> 16:20.582
Last night was stressful.

16:20.615 --> 16:22.149
I deserve it.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.183
You've got some weird friends.

16:23.217 --> 16:24.451
Don't talk about Jane like that.

16:24.485 --> 16:25.285
She's not well.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.220
So what?

16:26.253 --> 16:27.755
Everything's my fault now?

16:27.789 --> 16:30.090
How was I supposed to know
about the fucking candles?

16:30.123 --> 16:32.025
I told you she's got a phobia.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.161
I get it, she's
scared of the dark.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.196
But why is she
freaking out so much?

16:36.230 --> 16:38.600
-She's crazy.
-Maybe you're fucking crazy.

16:39.701 --> 16:43.738
Fuck off.

16:51.245 --> 16:55.717
I, I just wanna say goodbye.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.251
Then, goodbye.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.120
Jane, I'm sorry
about last night.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.558
You have nothing
to apologize for.

17:03.591 --> 17:06.360
Are you sure you
wanna stay here alone?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.028
Hm?

17:18.138 --> 17:19.239
- Oh my...
- Hey, hey!

17:19.273 --> 17:21.141
- Guys!
- Calm down, okay?

17:21.174 --> 17:22.175
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I can't, I don't...

17:22.209 --> 17:23.076
Take a deep breath.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.112
Girl, you have to
calm the fuck down.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.114
Hey, hey, no, no, wait, wait!

17:27.147 --> 17:28.348
- Ugh!
- Will!

17:28.382 --> 17:29.817
What the fuck
is happening here?

17:37.892 --> 17:38.693
Do you know him?

17:38.726 --> 17:40.795
Yes, I met
him in the town.

17:40.828 --> 17:41.896
He's a worker.

17:41.930 --> 17:45.567
I was expecting him to check
the power in the house.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.801
He's alive.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.468
We have to get him
to the hospital.

17:48.503 --> 17:50.237
Okay?

17:56.811 --> 17:58.211
What happened to him?

17:58.245 --> 17:58.846
Nothing.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.280
What a pain in the ass.

18:00.314 --> 18:02.316
If anything happens,
we were never here.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.164
How is he?

18:17.197 --> 18:18.265
I think he's coming to.

18:19.901 --> 18:20.802
It's all right.

18:20.835 --> 18:21.869
We're taking you into town.

18:21.903 --> 18:22.737
They'll help you there.

18:22.770 --> 18:23.838
What happened to you?

18:25.907 --> 18:27.240
There's a man here.

18:28.810 --> 18:30.645
-It's them.
-Who?

18:30.678 --> 18:31.913
They're crazy.

18:31.946 --> 18:33.848
They robbed me and
almost killed me.

18:33.881 --> 18:35.683
What's going on here?

18:35.717 --> 18:36.618
Don't stop.

18:36.651 --> 18:37.885
Keep driving, and step on it.

18:39.554 --> 18:41.589
Guys, do you have any idea
what's happening in town?

18:41.623 --> 18:43.558
People are going
insane over that virus.

18:43.591 --> 18:44.826
Everyone's in a panic.

18:44.859 --> 18:46.694
I saw them breaking
into a few houses.

18:46.728 --> 18:48.896
They stopped me on the
road in this forest.

18:48.930 --> 18:49.864
I was stabbed, but I got away.

18:49.897 --> 18:51.933
But not before getting
one of their guys, too.

18:51.966 --> 18:52.867
Let's go, let's go.

18:52.900 --> 18:53.835
Let's get the fuck out of here.

18:53.868 --> 18:55.570
What the hell?

18:55.603 --> 18:57.639
No, no, no, no, go, go!

19:01.375 --> 19:03.243
-Hi, there.
-Hello.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.679
I'm new around here.

19:04.712 --> 19:05.913
I was out hunting,

19:05.947 --> 19:08.750
but I think I've got
myself a little lost.

19:08.783 --> 19:10.384
Oh, yeah, it happens a lot.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.353
If you follow this road
you'll get into town.

19:13.387 --> 19:14.522
Thanks.

19:14.555 --> 19:16.658
The thing is, I'm
looking for my brother.

19:16.691 --> 19:19.359
He's a little off, if
you know what I mean.

19:19.393 --> 19:21.929
I thought he could
use some fresh air,

19:21.963 --> 19:24.498
but he cut himself on
a bunch of branches.

19:24.532 --> 19:25.933
Had a bit of an episode.

19:25.967 --> 19:28.201
He ran off into the
woods somewhere.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.270
You haven't seen anyone?

19:30.303 --> 19:32.807
-Oh, we did.
-Great.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.841
Where did you see him?

19:33.875 --> 19:37.310
Oh, well, I mean, we
heard someone was shouting

19:37.344 --> 19:38.880
at the other side of the forest.

19:39.781 --> 19:40.848
But I'm going into town,

19:40.882 --> 19:44.418
and if you want to, I can
call the police for you.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.353
That would be great.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.522
All right.

19:47.555 --> 19:49.824
Any chance I could
catch a ride out there?

19:49.857 --> 19:51.626
No, I'm sorry.

19:51.659 --> 19:54.361
You are a stranger and
we're in a deep forest.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.863
Anything can happen.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.367
I'll just look for
him myself then.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.301
Mm hm.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.237
But tell them now, in town.

20:11.846 --> 20:13.447
Go, go, go!

20:23.991 --> 20:24.992
Run them over!

20:25.960 --> 20:27.294
Come on!

20:27.327 --> 20:29.362
Come on.

20:31.032 --> 20:32.967
I need to take Kriss.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.592
Boo!

20:59.694 --> 21:01.394
Weak.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.965
That's how they used to
spank when I was a kid.

21:03.998 --> 21:05.499
That's the best you can do?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.035
Is it warm in there?

21:08.069 --> 21:11.606
Hm, keep playing these stupid
games and it'll get cold.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.436
Did you hear that?

21:43.470 --> 21:45.405
Fuck it.

21:46.741 --> 21:47.675
Are they sleeping there or what?

21:47.708 --> 21:49.409
What are you waiting for, guys?

21:49.442 --> 21:50.611
We don't have time.

21:50.645 --> 21:51.879
I'm going inside.

21:51.913 --> 21:54.782
Stay in the car.

21:58.853 --> 22:00.087
Hey!

22:00.121 --> 22:03.925
Kriss, Will!

22:09.163 --> 22:11.699
Oh, shit!

22:11.732 --> 22:12.967
We have to go.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.035
Listen to me!

22:17.437 --> 22:19.006
Whoa, whoa, bro, occupied.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.374
We have to get
outta here, Kriss.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.410
Just tell me what's
happening already!

22:23.443 --> 22:24.477
There's no time.

22:24.512 --> 22:25.613
We'll talk in the car.

22:26.547 --> 22:28.481
-Be right back.
-Get in the car!

22:28.516 --> 22:29.684
What is he doing?

22:29.717 --> 22:30.618
- You idiot!
- Will!

22:30.651 --> 22:31.919
- Will!
- I'm not leaving

22:31.953 --> 22:33.020
without my stuff.

22:33.054 --> 22:34.454
-No way.
-Just go without him.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.489
No, I'm not going without him.

22:36.524 --> 22:39.426
Ah, my precious.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.127
I've got it!

22:42.730 --> 22:44.431
Will, turn around!

22:44.464 --> 22:45.800
Will!

22:45.833 --> 22:48.401
Is the show over?

22:51.072 --> 22:52.405
He killed him!

22:52.439 --> 22:53.440
Shut the fuck up!

22:53.473 --> 22:55.543
- Start the car.
- Will!

22:55.576 --> 22:57.444
The show is only just beginning.

23:00.748 --> 23:02.149
- Fucking spark plugs.
- Start it.

23:02.183 --> 23:03.117
Come on!

23:03.150 --> 23:04.451
- Out of the car, quick!
- No!

23:04.484 --> 23:05.987
Let's go!

23:12.593 --> 23:13.661
That's only one.

23:13.694 --> 23:16.130
Where's the other one?

23:16.163 --> 23:17.064
Check upstairs.

23:17.098 --> 23:18.633
Oh, Will, he killed him.

23:18.666 --> 23:22.069
He killed Will.

23:22.103 --> 23:23.070
He's dead.

23:24.739 --> 23:25.573
Come on!

23:45.993 --> 23:48.863
- Oh, oh, shit.
- Careful.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.700
-Just let me look.
-Bastard.

23:59.607 --> 24:01.509
Not looking good, is it?

24:01.542 --> 24:02.677
It'll be fine.

24:08.883 --> 24:11.185
- Shit!
- You're okay.

24:12.553 --> 24:15.523
Reminds me of one of those
shitty-ass Bruce Willis movies.

24:17.258 --> 24:18.225
We need a plan.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.029
They'll find a way,
sooner or later.

24:22.063 --> 24:23.731
Do you have any other weapons?

24:23.764 --> 24:27.802
Yeah, I have a gun, but
it's in the workshop.

24:27.835 --> 24:29.070
Now, that's one option.

24:29.103 --> 24:30.237
What about the windows?

24:30.271 --> 24:31.505
Huh?

24:31.539 --> 24:32.807
They're strong.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.841
They won't break in.

24:33.874 --> 24:35.676
We need to check everything.

24:35.710 --> 24:36.711
Okay?

24:36.744 --> 24:37.578
One more time.

24:40.648 --> 24:41.549
Okay.

25:21.889 --> 25:24.525
We're having spaghetti
for our last supper?

25:27.995 --> 25:29.663
- Not funny.
- Hm.

25:32.366 --> 25:35.302
This should be enough
for the four of us.

25:35.336 --> 25:36.170
Okay.

25:43.944 --> 25:45.146
- You know...
- Hm?

25:52.787 --> 25:56.624
I saw this movie a while back.

25:56.657 --> 25:58.626
Some kind of apocalypse film.

26:00.261 --> 26:03.264
Whole bunch of people locked
themselves in a house,

26:03.297 --> 26:05.099
or maybe it was a lab.

26:05.132 --> 26:09.136
They have to start eating
each other to survive.

26:10.304 --> 26:12.773
So, let's just be
ready for the worst.

26:26.654 --> 26:28.689
It's a joke, man.

26:28.722 --> 26:29.356
Relax.

26:37.932 --> 26:39.200
Where's Kriss?

26:59.086 --> 27:00.254
Kriss?

27:06.293 --> 27:07.261
Help!

27:07.294 --> 27:08.195
Help, guys!

27:09.763 --> 27:11.866
Someone doesn't look
very happy to see me.

27:11.899 --> 27:13.701
Jane, get Kriss out of here.

27:13.734 --> 27:14.735
Can you hold it?

27:14.768 --> 27:15.836
Just hurry up already.

27:15.870 --> 27:17.071
Kriss, come on.

27:17.104 --> 27:20.074
Kriss, wake up.

27:56.777 --> 27:57.512
Hurry up!

28:07.788 --> 28:09.190
Here comes daddy.

28:15.896 --> 28:16.730
Fuck!

28:43.290 --> 28:44.725
-Hold on.
-Okay.

28:54.969 --> 28:56.971
-All right.
-Thank you.

29:03.277 --> 29:04.111
Okay.

29:22.062 --> 29:23.397
How long was I out for?

29:24.932 --> 29:26.133
Not so long.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.001
And the men?

29:28.936 --> 29:31.405
Oh, they didn't come back.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.442
Ray hasn't seen them.

29:35.476 --> 29:36.477
Maybe the left.

29:38.245 --> 29:39.079
I doubt it.

29:40.914 --> 29:44.586
These beasts can smell
blood a mile away.

29:44.619 --> 29:46.153
And I, I'm soaked in it.

29:47.888 --> 29:49.557
They'll probably
wait until dark.

29:57.298 --> 29:58.966
- You know?
- Hm?

29:58.999 --> 30:02.236
I never got the chance
to try your coffee.

30:02.269 --> 30:04.071
God blesses you.

30:04.104 --> 30:07.274
Why?

30:09.943 --> 30:10.578
'Cause I'm...

30:12.614 --> 30:16.350
I'm a very bad barista.

30:16.383 --> 30:17.851
Really?

30:17.885 --> 30:19.820
So, you lied to me then.

30:20.988 --> 30:22.489
Sorry, life is life.

30:24.425 --> 30:28.095
Well, I got a confession, too.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.600
I'm kind of a shitty
electrician myself.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.937
Aren't we a naughty couple?

30:43.645 --> 30:46.080
Got some vitamins for me?

30:51.285 --> 30:53.387
They're my fear pills.

30:57.191 --> 31:00.494
I wouldn't mind a little
help with my own fears.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.599
You, you don't need them.

31:08.035 --> 31:10.605
I have, I have nyctophobia.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.511
I'm afraid of the dark
since I was a kid.

31:18.145 --> 31:20.114
When my father drank,

31:20.147 --> 31:21.982
he became aggressive.

31:22.015 --> 31:22.650
Jane!

31:24.017 --> 31:25.285
Open the door.

31:25.319 --> 31:26.920
I know you're in there.

31:26.954 --> 31:28.122
Stop it,
leave her alone.

31:28.155 --> 31:29.356
Just leave us alone!

31:29.390 --> 31:30.491
Shut up!

31:30.525 --> 31:32.059
Ow!

31:32.092 --> 31:33.360
Ow!

31:33.394 --> 31:35.062
He beat me.

31:35.963 --> 31:36.997
And my mother.

31:38.365 --> 31:40.968
Mom hid me in the scariest
place in the house.

31:42.269 --> 31:44.304
Only the flame of
a candle saved me

31:44.338 --> 31:46.373
from the darkness
of the basement.

31:48.743 --> 31:51.646
Once, my drunk father fell
asleep with a cigarette,

31:51.679 --> 31:53.981
and there was a fire.

31:54.014 --> 31:57.284
I began to suffocate,
but I could not get out.

31:58.620 --> 32:01.455
Not because of the fire,
but because I was afraid

32:01.488 --> 32:03.957
of my father more than death.

32:03.991 --> 32:06.728
Jane, open the door!

32:06.761 --> 32:08.462
-Jane.
-Go away.

32:09.631 --> 32:12.132
You're not true.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.401
Jane, Jane.

32:20.708 --> 32:25.613
By some miracle I survived.

32:36.223 --> 32:40.628
And the only thing he gave
me the day he left, is fear.

32:47.367 --> 32:48.503
Hey.

32:58.546 --> 33:01.616
We're lucky, you and I.

33:01.649 --> 33:04.418
Look what my father left me.

33:04.451 --> 33:06.688
He held it down and
refused to let go,

33:06.721 --> 33:08.322
even when I was in agony.

33:14.127 --> 33:16.497
I got really good at faking it.

33:16.531 --> 33:18.465
I would pretend to black out.

33:20.133 --> 33:23.136
And that's when he, he
would finally let go.

33:23.170 --> 33:26.139
But you know, I,
I don't hate him.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.510
I hate the bastards
that killed him

33:28.543 --> 33:30.143
before I could do it myself.

33:34.649 --> 33:37.552
Well, when this is all over,

33:37.585 --> 33:42.389
we'll go to whichever cafe
serves the best coffee in town.

33:43.457 --> 33:44.258
Mm hm.

33:44.291 --> 33:46.093
Hey, I promise you that.

33:47.127 --> 33:48.228
- Okay?
- Mm hm.

34:13.253 --> 34:14.087
Kriss?

34:15.289 --> 34:18.091
This is the song
that was playing when we met.

34:19.861 --> 34:22.095
You know, it's strange.

34:24.566 --> 34:27.367
I really thought we were
going to be something serious,

34:29.136 --> 34:32.272
but now he's just lying
there out in the road.

34:34.141 --> 34:37.210
That's what I get for being
such a whore my entire life.

34:37.244 --> 34:39.279
Well, Kriss,
you're not a whore.

34:46.854 --> 34:47.689
Stub it out.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.358
What?

34:51.391 --> 34:53.528
Put the cigarette out.

34:55.797 --> 34:56.731
Why would I do that?

34:56.764 --> 34:59.199
Jane doesn't like the
smell in the house.

34:59.232 --> 35:01.703
Seems like she made
an exception for me.

35:09.777 --> 35:10.845
I always used them.

35:12.647 --> 35:14.348
I used you, too.

35:14.381 --> 35:17.719
In school, guys were always
falling at your feet,

35:17.752 --> 35:19.754
and I was so jealous.

35:22.189 --> 35:23.691
I was afraid of being alone.

35:25.893 --> 35:28.896
Do you know how many fires
happen because of cigarettes?

35:33.367 --> 35:34.468
Pray tell.

35:34.501 --> 35:36.904
One in five.

35:36.938 --> 35:38.338
Sounds serious.

35:39.473 --> 35:41.542
But I'm very, very careful.

35:42.977 --> 35:44.211
Watch this.

35:50.952 --> 35:55.255
Do you know how many people
die from domestic violence?

35:55.288 --> 35:56.289
Huh?

36:01.428 --> 36:02.630
It doesn't matter,
it was in the past--

36:02.664 --> 36:04.498
But it still matters to me.

36:04.532 --> 36:05.900
I wasn't just jealous.

36:05.933 --> 36:08.435
You dated them, I
fucked with them.

36:20.882 --> 36:21.849
Come on.

36:38.700 --> 36:39.867
-Let him go.
-Get him off me.

36:39.901 --> 36:41.869
Get him off of me.

36:43.871 --> 36:46.239
What's wrong with you?

36:49.677 --> 36:52.279
Kriss!

36:52.312 --> 36:55.650
Kriss, come back.

36:55.683 --> 36:57.317
- I'm sorry.
- No, Kriss!

36:57.350 --> 36:58.619
Jane.

36:58.653 --> 37:00.688
Ray, please, we
need to do something.

37:00.722 --> 37:01.388
It's too late.

37:02.557 --> 37:04.692
- No.
- It's too late.

37:04.726 --> 37:05.827
-No!
-Jane.

37:05.860 --> 37:07.028
Kriss, no!

37:22.977 --> 37:24.078
We have to do something.

37:24.112 --> 37:27.280
We can't just sit here and
wait for them to kill us.

37:28.816 --> 37:30.551
Or wait till you
kill each other.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.488
The woman speaks the truth.

37:34.522 --> 37:36.023
We have to take a risk.

37:36.057 --> 37:38.659
There's no way we'll
make it out at night.

37:38.693 --> 37:40.928
The gun, it's in
the workshop, right?

37:40.962 --> 37:42.395
I don't know where it is.

37:42.429 --> 37:44.498
I don't know if I
have any bullets.

37:47.902 --> 37:49.103
We have to try.

37:49.137 --> 37:52.640
You distract them while I try
to escape through the attic.

37:54.809 --> 37:59.312
A noble deed worthy
of a true hero.

38:03.383 --> 38:07.354
Where exactly is the gun?

38:11.692 --> 38:14.361
The gun is in the
workshop I think.

38:15.462 --> 38:17.098
But there's a side entrance.

38:17.131 --> 38:19.100
You'll need to look hard.

38:19.133 --> 38:22.837
It might be under
the wooden table.

38:22.870 --> 38:23.704
It's somewhere.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.309
Okay, listen.

38:30.778 --> 38:34.481
I'll go out there and
start making some noise.

38:34.515 --> 38:35.683
Mm hm.

38:35.716 --> 38:38.953
You stay sharp
and hold the door.

38:38.986 --> 38:41.354
- You go it?
- Got it.

39:30.071 --> 39:31.706
Come on.

39:49.190 --> 39:49.924
Hurry up!

39:49.957 --> 39:55.029
Come on!

39:55.897 --> 39:57.632
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

41:52.847 --> 41:54.615
Yes.

41:56.717 --> 41:57.518
Oh God.

43:34.115 --> 43:36.150
No way they'll come back.

43:38.953 --> 43:40.788
We only got
two shots left.

43:42.957 --> 43:44.191
One for each of 'em.

43:46.260 --> 43:47.995
We need to stay here for now.

43:50.197 --> 43:52.700
You shouldn't try to stand
up by yourself, okay?

43:59.206 --> 44:00.274
He's getting worse.

44:00.307 --> 44:01.876
We need to do something.

44:01.909 --> 44:03.344
We have to leave, Jane.

44:03.377 --> 44:04.912
No!

44:04.945 --> 44:06.247
We'll get him into town.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.715
He needs help.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.817
We won't even making
it two steps with him.

44:09.850 --> 44:11.018
They'll kill us.

44:11.051 --> 44:13.754
When you needed my help,
I didn't leave you.

44:14.989 --> 44:15.823
He's right.

44:17.791 --> 44:19.460
No, no, no, no, no.

44:19.493 --> 44:21.428
No.

44:21.462 --> 44:22.730
Don't say that.

44:22.763 --> 44:23.964
We have well, weapons.

44:23.998 --> 44:24.999
We'll make it.

44:27.067 --> 44:31.105
If you try to save
me, it'll kill us all.

44:31.138 --> 44:32.439
Yeah, he's right.

44:32.473 --> 44:34.341
-And you know that, Jane.
-No!

44:35.376 --> 44:36.744
I'm not leaving you.

44:36.777 --> 44:37.411
No way.

44:42.116 --> 44:43.417
Give us the gun and go.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.922
Why are you so stubborn, Jane?

44:53.794 --> 44:54.428
Hold on.

45:00.134 --> 45:02.803
It's okay.

45:05.139 --> 45:06.473
All right, we'll leave.

45:08.008 --> 45:11.345
On one condition: We'll
come back for him.

45:11.378 --> 45:12.479
How are you gonna do it?

45:15.783 --> 45:17.051
They know we're armed.

45:17.084 --> 45:19.386
And when they figure
out that we're gone,

45:19.420 --> 45:21.523
they're gonna take all
the stuff from the house.

45:21.556 --> 45:23.757
Then we'll come back
with medical supplies

45:23.791 --> 45:26.427
-and leave together.
-All right.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.394
Sounds good.

45:28.295 --> 45:29.296
I know a forester.

45:31.098 --> 45:33.133
He lives nearby.

45:33.167 --> 45:36.470
I think he has everything we
need and spark plugs, too.

45:37.838 --> 45:39.807
It's like half an
hour from here.

45:41.543 --> 45:44.512
Be careful.

45:44.546 --> 45:45.412
I'm okay.

45:47.281 --> 45:48.115
Thanks.

45:54.589 --> 45:58.325
Well, don't take too long.

45:59.226 --> 46:00.327
I'll be downstairs.

46:01.495 --> 46:02.763
We have no time.

46:20.080 --> 46:20.914
Hey.

46:22.916 --> 46:23.951
How are you feeling?

46:26.554 --> 46:27.522
I can manage.

46:31.325 --> 46:33.561
You have to be here for a while.

46:35.597 --> 46:38.600
But we, we'll come back for you.

46:38.633 --> 46:39.500
I promise.

46:41.235 --> 46:42.069
I'll be here.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.575
-We'll be right back.
-Yeah.

46:49.977 --> 46:53.814
All right.

46:59.887 --> 47:03.123
Um, I'm really, I'm
really sorry that...

47:05.292 --> 47:07.261
That everything's
had to be like this.

47:11.533 --> 47:13.568
It'll be a story
for our grandkids.

48:13.695 --> 48:16.497
I hope they won't find
him till we get back.

48:17.431 --> 48:18.966
- They won't.
- Hm?

48:18.999 --> 48:20.000
If he stays quiet.

48:27.207 --> 48:28.710
- We'll be out in the dark.
- Mm hm.

48:28.743 --> 48:30.110
You forget something?

48:35.315 --> 48:36.316
Run!

49:06.714 --> 49:09.249
Don't leave me here alone.

49:10.184 --> 49:11.084
I'm scared.

49:28.101 --> 49:29.537
Oh, shit!

51:13.875 --> 51:15.208
Gotcha!

51:40.400 --> 51:41.603
Ow!

51:51.913 --> 51:53.715
What a smell.

52:04.926 --> 52:08.863
I think we are about
to get real close.

52:25.813 --> 52:26.881
Quiet.

52:26.914 --> 52:27.749
It's me.

52:29.249 --> 52:29.884
Okay.

52:30.952 --> 52:32.920
Nice job with that one.

52:32.954 --> 52:35.890
Oh, Jane.

52:39.259 --> 52:39.894
Yeah?

52:52.439 --> 52:55.242
Oh shit.

52:55.275 --> 52:55.877
It's okay.

52:56.911 --> 52:58.278
It's okay.

53:00.915 --> 53:01.749
Jane!

53:02.917 --> 53:04.384
Snap out of it.

53:04.418 --> 53:06.219
Fuck, Jane!

53:06.253 --> 53:07.989
-Oh my God.
-Listen to me.

53:08.022 --> 53:10.257
-Oh my God.
-Jane.

53:10.290 --> 53:11.092
Listen to me.

53:11.125 --> 53:12.860
-As soon as I throw this, run.
-No!

53:12.894 --> 53:14.929
-One, two, three.
-No, no.

53:16.263 --> 53:17.965
Run.

53:37.685 --> 53:38.753
Fuck you.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.495
Greedy piece of shit.

53:48.529 --> 53:49.997
You're gonna pay for that.

53:55.002 --> 53:56.838
Jane.

54:09.884 --> 54:13.621
Jane.

55:14.048 --> 55:14.849
Jane.

55:14.882 --> 55:16.017
Hey, Jane, Jane, Jane.

55:16.050 --> 55:16.884
Come on, girl.

55:17.852 --> 55:19.620
Don't pass out on me now.

55:19.654 --> 55:21.088
Jane, Jane.

55:27.862 --> 55:28.663
Come on, girl.

55:28.696 --> 55:29.697
Swallow it.

55:29.730 --> 55:30.531
Swallow it.

55:30.565 --> 55:31.799
Hey, it'll help.

55:31.833 --> 55:32.934
Hey, come on.

55:32.967 --> 55:35.002
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

55:35.036 --> 55:36.504
Hey, girl, come on.

55:36.537 --> 55:37.437
Come on, Jane.

55:37.470 --> 55:38.405
Hey.

55:38.438 --> 55:41.142
Hey.

55:41.175 --> 55:44.779
Hey, there you go.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.616
You know you won't get
away from me that easy.

55:48.649 --> 55:49.917
Understand?

55:49.951 --> 55:51.886
You still owe me
that coffee date.

55:51.919 --> 55:52.887
Remember?

55:52.920 --> 55:55.355
Yeah?

56:15.643 --> 56:16.944
Tom?

56:16.978 --> 56:18.411
Tom, are you here?

56:20.982 --> 56:23.050
Maybe he's not around.

56:23.084 --> 56:25.452
Huh?

56:26.854 --> 56:28.756
We should grab everything
we need and go back.

56:30.725 --> 56:31.559
Okay.

56:42.203 --> 56:43.436
Light switch.

56:50.477 --> 56:51.112
Thanks.

57:20.241 --> 57:21.842
Well, that's a nice start.

57:33.587 --> 57:35.089
That'll do.

57:35.122 --> 57:37.124
I would put that
back if I were you.

57:38.626 --> 57:40.761
- Tom.
- Stay where you are.

57:40.795 --> 57:42.563
Easy, old man.

57:42.596 --> 57:43.496
I'm a friend.

57:43.531 --> 57:44.966
You're no friend of mine.

58:01.582 --> 58:02.383
I'm here with Jane.

58:02.416 --> 58:05.152
-We need your help.
-Jane, you say?

58:05.186 --> 58:06.520
So, who are you?

58:06.554 --> 58:07.855
I came over to fix her power.

58:07.888 --> 58:09.557
The power was off.

58:09.590 --> 58:11.525
And then some robbers
attacked the house.

58:11.559 --> 58:12.593
Where'd they come from?

58:13.694 --> 58:14.996
It's only a forest.

58:15.029 --> 58:16.197
They're not people, Tom.

58:16.230 --> 58:18.899
More like wild animals.

58:18.933 --> 58:20.234
We barely fought them off.

58:28.242 --> 58:30.678
<i>Three masked</i>
<i>men pull out an ATM</i>

58:30.711 --> 58:32.613
<i>directly from the bank branch.</i>

58:32.646 --> 58:34.081
<i>According to the police chief,</i>

58:34.115 --> 58:36.283
<i>the criminals took</i>
<i>advantage of the turmoil</i>

58:36.317 --> 58:38.219
<i>caused by the city protests.</i>

58:38.252 --> 58:40.788
<i>Two masked men left the</i>
<i>branch.</i>

58:51.098 --> 58:53.701
Tom, ask Jane if you
don't believe me.

58:53.734 --> 58:54.735
She's in the cellar.

58:55.870 --> 58:58.606
Someone got hurt
back at the house.

58:58.639 --> 58:59.774
We need supplies, you know?

58:59.807 --> 59:01.208
In the cellar, you say?

59:02.309 --> 59:04.278
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

59:04.311 --> 59:05.146
Okay.

59:10.651 --> 59:12.086
911,
what's your emergency?

59:12.119 --> 59:13.354
We need help.

59:13.387 --> 59:14.889
What's wrong?

59:14.922 --> 59:17.691
We, we were attacked by
the men from the news.

59:17.725 --> 59:19.860
Okay, what's
your address, ma'am?

59:19.894 --> 59:21.862
- Jane, Tom's here.
- Ma'am?

59:21.896 --> 59:23.164
- Can you come up?
- Ma'am?

59:26.033 --> 59:26.867
I'm coming.

59:40.414 --> 59:41.916
What's happened, dear?

59:42.983 --> 59:44.652
We were attacked.

59:44.685 --> 59:46.220
Are you all right?

59:46.253 --> 59:47.121
I'm fine.

59:47.154 --> 59:49.824
We need to call the
police and go back

59:49.857 --> 59:51.826
before Ray bleeds
to death, right?

59:52.660 --> 59:53.294
Yeah.

59:54.962 --> 59:56.297
Did you find the spark plugs?

59:57.965 --> 59:59.834
Yeah, we can go.

59:59.867 --> 1:00:00.701
Come on.

1:00:12.713 --> 1:00:14.148
Are you going to answer it?

1:00:15.683 --> 1:00:16.917
The gun!

1:00:38.139 --> 1:00:38.939
Jane?

1:00:40.207 --> 1:00:42.343
Hey, open up.

1:00:42.376 --> 1:00:43.978
They died because of you.

1:00:44.011 --> 1:00:46.413
No, because of you.

1:00:46.447 --> 1:00:48.749
If you'd just driven into town,

1:00:48.782 --> 1:00:50.384
they'd all be alive right now.

1:00:52.453 --> 1:00:55.422
But you went back
and you killed them.

1:00:55.456 --> 1:00:57.124
It's not true.

1:00:57.158 --> 1:00:59.426
-Because you're stubborn!
-Shut up!

1:01:09.103 --> 1:01:10.437
We could still walk away.

1:01:10.471 --> 1:01:12.239
I got money.

1:01:12.273 --> 1:01:13.107
You hear me?

1:01:14.275 --> 1:01:18.145
Lots of money.

1:01:18.179 --> 1:01:19.246
Jane, Jane, Jane.

1:01:22.049 --> 1:01:25.452
It's a shame it's not
gonna work out between us.

1:01:30.525 --> 1:01:31.825
Sweet dreams, babe.

1:02:16.070 --> 1:02:20.774
Open this goddamn door.

1:02:20.808 --> 1:02:23.511
Who raised you to
be this stubborn?

1:02:23.545 --> 1:02:24.812
-Jane.
-No, you're not real.

1:02:24.845 --> 1:02:26.247
- Go away.
- Jane.

1:02:35.389 --> 1:02:36.223
Jane!

1:02:37.825 --> 1:02:42.429
Open this goddamn door!

1:06:11.573 --> 1:06:15.142
You're alive.

1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:31.325
Oh, hello.

1:07:17.404 --> 1:07:18.205
Where's Jane?

1:07:20.207 --> 1:07:21.208
She's in the car.

1:07:22.844 --> 1:07:23.645
It's over.

1:07:25.212 --> 1:07:26.748
You want some, hm?

1:07:26.781 --> 1:07:27.749
For courage.

1:07:28.783 --> 1:07:29.817
Jane!

1:07:32.620 --> 1:07:33.453
Jane!

1:07:37.424 --> 1:07:38.258
Jane!

1:07:42.496 --> 1:07:43.765
Ray, Ray, Ray.

1:07:53.407 --> 1:07:56.778
You know, Jane and
I had a little talk.

1:07:57.879 --> 1:08:00.414
We decided that
you're dead weight.

1:08:00.447 --> 1:08:02.650
Hm?

1:08:02.684 --> 1:08:04.819
What have you done with her?

1:08:07.187 --> 1:08:09.691
Some might say I killed her,

1:08:09.724 --> 1:08:12.259
but I think I gave her a chance.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:13.093
You know?

1:08:14.394 --> 1:08:16.096
A fighting chance.

1:08:21.903 --> 1:08:22.704
Shit.

1:08:24.438 --> 1:08:25.673
You're a good guy, Ray.

1:08:27.942 --> 1:08:29.844
Work like a dog.

1:08:35.950 --> 1:08:39.419
Girls love guys like that, yeah?

1:08:39.453 --> 1:08:44.458
But you know, loyalty
can get you killed.

1:08:51.198 --> 1:08:54.167
I always knew there was
something wrong with you.

1:08:54.201 --> 1:08:56.537
Oh, I guess you're not
as stupid as you look.

1:08:56.571 --> 1:09:01.174
You're a coward and buy
your way, your way...

1:09:01.208 --> 1:09:05.178
Buy your way out with
other people's lives.

1:09:05.212 --> 1:09:08.382
Fear is a very powerful thing.

1:09:08.415 --> 1:09:10.685
It's stronger than
you think, huh?

1:09:10.718 --> 1:09:14.221
It's everywhere; it's in
every corner of this house.

1:09:14.254 --> 1:09:16.456
It slithers onto your clothes.

1:09:16.490 --> 1:09:17.892
It worms your way
under its head.

1:09:17.925 --> 1:09:19.560
Drives you insane, huh?

1:09:19.594 --> 1:09:20.728
Do you feel it?

1:09:20.762 --> 1:09:22.262
Do you feel it?

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.401
Do you think

1:09:27.434 --> 1:09:28.435
I'm afraid of you?

1:09:29.302 --> 1:09:31.506
You're afraid or a fool, man.

1:09:33.373 --> 1:09:35.943
Doesn't matter now, though.

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:48.122
Aw.

1:10:07.340 --> 1:10:09.644
Do you know the
story of Prometheus?

1:10:09.677 --> 1:10:11.512
Hm?

1:10:11.546 --> 1:10:16.551
The Titan that gave humans

1:10:17.284 --> 1:10:18.418
the gift of fire.

1:10:21.288 --> 1:10:22.456
Hm?

1:10:22.489 --> 1:10:24.491
Why do you think that
Zeus punished him?

1:10:25.492 --> 1:10:26.994
Ray, tell me.

1:10:28.996 --> 1:10:30.631
Because it wasn't just fire.

1:10:32.066 --> 1:10:35.302
Prometheus gave people
the gift of hope.

1:10:35.335 --> 1:10:38.873
He thought he could
rid, rid humans of fear.

1:10:38.906 --> 1:10:43.644
But Zeus knew that fear
is our one true ruler.

1:10:52.019 --> 1:10:52.820
Fuck.

1:10:56.389 --> 1:10:59.594
Not everyone can be
entrusted with this power.

1:11:00.962 --> 1:11:01.829
No, no, no, no.

1:11:01.863 --> 1:11:03.664
You can't run from fear.

1:11:03.698 --> 1:11:05.633
You have no where to go.

1:11:12.974 --> 1:11:13.808
You hear?

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:16.309
Maybe it's an alarm.

1:11:17.011 --> 1:11:18.980
Time for somebody to wake up.

1:11:21.949 --> 1:11:25.720
Oh, don't go anywhere.

1:11:25.753 --> 1:11:26.687
I'll be right back.

It's a date.

Somewhere in a
nice crowded place.

1:12:41.529 --> 1:12:42.797
Do you agree?

1:12:42.830 --> 1:12:44.431

1:12:44.464 --> 1:12:45.766
No coffee then?

1:12:59.847 --> 1:13:02.884
Didn't anyone ever tell
you that stubbornness

We have to go.

1:14:48.255 --> 1:14:49.690
We need to climb the stairs.

1:14:50.925 --> 1:14:53.894
Jane, I'm not really
in fighting shape.

1:14:54.762 --> 1:14:55.596
Me neither.

1:14:57.665 --> 1:15:02.603

Oops, our hero.

1:17:02.990 --> 1:17:03.991
Stubborn Jane.

1:17:04.024 --> 1:17:05.259
Stubborn girl.

1:17:05.292 --> 1:17:07.161
Listen to me, huh?

1:17:07.194 --> 1:17:08.028
Come here.

1:17:10.297 --> 1:17:13.100
Do you remember how
I found your house?

1:17:14.268 --> 1:17:15.803
You invited me.

1:17:15.836 --> 1:17:17.438
You, yourself.

1:17:17.471 --> 1:17:19.974
And you must remember, Jane.

1:17:20.007 --> 1:17:21.342
Answer me, remember.

1:17:21.375 --> 1:17:22.810
Hm?

1:17:22.843 --> 1:17:25.813
You must certainly
remember why you did it.

1:17:25.846 --> 1:17:28.149
Right?

1:17:28.182 --> 1:17:29.884
Because you're
afraid of the dark.

1:17:31.051 --> 1:17:33.420
It's not the dark you
should be afraid of.

1:17:42.730 --> 1:17:46.734
You should be afraid of
those who lurk within it.

1:17:48.736 --> 1:17:51.405
That's right.

1:18:40.087 --> 1:18:41.422
Ray, Ray.

1:18:41.455 --> 1:18:42.489
Please, Ray.

1:18:42.524 --> 1:18:45.492

1:18:45.527 --> 1:18:50.464
Hey.

1:18:55.803 --> 1:18:57.338

1:18:59.106 --> 1:18:59.873
Jane?

1:19:18.459 --> 1:19:20.427
You've done well, Jane.

1:19:23.264 --> 1:19:24.131
So well.

1:19:29.571 --> 1:19:33.941
Our ability to see a problem

1:19:33.974 --> 1:19:35.909

1:19:35.943 --> 1:19:38.078
What we may consider
to be our salvation

1:19:38.112 --> 1:19:40.981
may actually be
damnation in disguise.

1:19:41.015 --> 1:19:46.020
And often, Jane, so often our
fear, it's just an illusion.

1:19:48.022 --> 1:19:50.391
Or worse, a dangerous delusion.

1:19:52.126 --> 1:19:55.362
