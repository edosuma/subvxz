Yeah.

08:28.229 --> 08:29.194
Hey, what would you see

08:29.196 --> 08:31.530
Casablanca or Cat People?

08:31.532 --> 08:32.765
- Ooh, Cat People.
- Austin?

08:32.767 --> 08:35.035
- Sounds like...
- Austin. - Sounds like a winner.

08:36.236 --> 08:38.270
Okay, so, it's a modern girl

08:38.272 --> 08:40.304
- cursed by an ancient legend.

08:40.307 --> 08:42.472
The legend of the cat people.

08:42.475 --> 08:45.077
Yeah, it sounds pretty sexy.

08:45.079 --> 08:47.078
Definitely.

08:47.080 --> 08:47.949
Bastard.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.597
No, never mind.

09:05.599 --> 09:07.266
- There a problem Inglis?
- Lemme see. - Yeah.

09:07.268 --> 09:08.233
I keep sendin' 'em my stories

09:08.235 --> 09:10.234
and they haven't published any
of 'em yet.

09:10.236 --> 09:12.603
The Dawn of the Days of Glory.

09:12.605 --> 09:15.240
The Great War, As Fought by Jack
Inglis.

09:17.610 --> 09:19.614
Hmm, January 17th, 1943.

09:21.749 --> 09:24.016
It was a cold night on the front
lines.

09:24.018 --> 09:25.550
There was a soft breeze in the
air,

09:25.552 --> 09:28.053
wafting the scent of the enemy
towards us.

09:28.055 --> 09:28.886
Guys...

09:28.888 --> 09:29.554
We could hear the artillery
fire

09:29.556 --> 09:31.323
echoing beyond the horizon.

09:31.325 --> 09:33.726
- It rattled our bones.
- Dear Roland,

09:33.728 --> 09:36.761
How can words describe
how much I love you?

09:36.763 --> 09:39.464
Well, come a little closer.

09:39.466 --> 09:44.336
Let me whisper in your darling
ears all these loving words,

09:44.338 --> 09:46.637
because they're meant for you.

09:46.639 --> 09:48.439
You are the world.

09:48.441 --> 09:50.476
You are everything.

09:50.478 --> 09:52.711
But part of me is missing.

09:52.713 --> 09:56.647
- And that part is you.
- Sleep is a dream.

09:56.649 --> 09:58.250
Reality,

09:58.252 --> 09:59.617
- a nightmare.
- A nightmare.

09:59.619 --> 10:01.386
It's a nightmare, Jack!

10:01.388 --> 10:03.188
No matter
what,

10:03.190 --> 10:05.591
no matter how long you're gone
for,

10:05.593 --> 10:09.761
whether it's weeks or
months or all of forever,

10:09.763 --> 10:13.399
I will always be yours, as you
are mine.

10:13.401 --> 10:15.670
From now to the end of time.

10:17.071 --> 10:19.106
I love you, and only you,

10:20.441 --> 10:21.375
for always.

10:23.344 --> 10:27.112
Keep this letter close
and dream of me often,

10:27.114 --> 10:28.516
as I dream of you.

10:29.682 --> 10:31.218
Be safe, my love.

10:32.986 --> 10:35.820
- For I am a soldier afterall, Forever yours, Barbara.
- An American soldier,

10:35.822 --> 10:40.059
prepared by the best to
fight and die for my country.

10:42.763 --> 10:44.530
Aw, come on, what's the big
deal?

10:44.532 --> 10:45.363
You know We would have read it

10:45.365 --> 10:46.799
if it got published anyways,
right?

10:46.801 --> 10:48.599
I didn't send this one in yet.

10:48.601 --> 10:49.834
I don't like it when people read
my stuff

10:49.836 --> 10:51.638
before it's finished.

10:53.173 --> 10:56.407
It's good.

10:56.409 --> 10:57.745
What it was good?

11:04.484 --> 11:07.752
- First squad, listen up.
- Atten-hut!

11:07.754 --> 11:11.356
Kraut armor has broken through
the lines at Sidi Bouzid.

11:11.358 --> 11:12.623
Battalion's reporting heavy
casualties

11:12.625 --> 11:16.160
to the 36th infantry and 1st
armor.

11:16.162 --> 11:19.397
The 26th RCT is falling back to
Kasserine.

11:19.399 --> 11:23.734
We'll reinforce the line and
wait there for further orders.

11:23.736 --> 11:25.471
Okay, everyone, pack up.

11:25.473 --> 11:27.639
Full gear, we're not comin' back
here.

11:27.641 --> 11:28.777
Any questions?

11:30.377 --> 11:33.381
Good, 30 minutes at the rally
point.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.150
Happy Valentine's Day.

12:21.729 --> 12:23.896
Say goodbye
to your father, James.

12:23.898 --> 12:25.564
Be good for
your Mother, all right?

12:25.566 --> 12:26.434
Okay.

12:30.771 --> 12:31.840
Okay, well,

12:32.840 --> 12:34.906
we're going then.

12:34.908 --> 12:36.909
I love you.

13:28.796 --> 13:31.429
Johnson, where are we
at with the extra ammo?

13:31.431 --> 13:33.631
I gotta check check back
at CP, we got nothin'.

13:33.633 --> 13:34.665
Well hurry up.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.133
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

13:36.135 --> 13:39.804
- I love you too. - Oh, Fuck your mother.
- Don't hurt yourself there.

13:39.806 --> 13:41.640
- Kit issues?
- No, it's not bad enough

13:41.642 --> 13:43.407
I got to take take a
shit every five minutes

13:43.409 --> 13:45.376
from these goddamn rations,
but I gotta fuck around

13:45.378 --> 13:47.679
with this junk now.

13:47.681 --> 13:48.749
Come here.

13:52.552 --> 13:55.487
Ah, you're all tangled up.

13:55.489 --> 13:56.954
What the hell's all
this shit for anyway?

13:56.956 --> 13:58.623
Since we're not gonna see any
action.

14:05.431 --> 14:07.366
- Lookin' good, soldier.
- Yeah?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.267
Like the belle of the ball.

14:09.269 --> 14:12.404
Thanks, Sergeant, I'll
probably be back.

14:44.370 --> 14:47.774
Goddammit!

19:13.706 --> 19:14.973
Don't move!

19:14.975 --> 19:17.675
Are you alone?

19:17.677 --> 19:18.976
Don't move.

19:18.978 --> 19:20.578
Is there anyone else here with
you?

19:20.580 --> 19:21.983
I said don't move!

19:26.019 --> 19:27.719
Halt!

21:51.031 --> 21:53.764
A minute 23 left
in the penalty to Bentley.

21:53.766 --> 21:55.867
Montreal crosses center ice and
Toe Blake

21:55.869 --> 21:58.036
brings the puck up to the
Chicago line.

21:58.038 --> 22:02.107
Can't get it past, Toomer
pokes it off his stick.

22:02.109 --> 22:05.143
Puck takes a strange bounce,
goes down the left side,

22:05.145 --> 22:06.511
it's picked up by Reg Hamilton,

22:06.513 --> 22:08.812
but he loses control and can't
get it up.

22:08.814 --> 22:10.749
Blake does a fine job
tying the Chicago defender

22:10.751 --> 22:14.152
- up along the boards.
- James, bedtime.

22:14.154 --> 22:16.020
But the game's not
over yet.

22:16.022 --> 22:18.322
It's getting late and you
have school in the morning.

22:18.324 --> 22:20.892
Say goodnight to your
father, and let's go.

22:20.894 --> 22:21.992
And dumps the puck
into

22:21.994 --> 22:24.762
the Montreal end after
being carried by Bouchard

22:24.764 --> 22:26.030
Sweet dreams.

22:26.032 --> 22:27.999
Time, get set up.

22:28.001 --> 22:30.135
And with a minute left in the
penalty,

22:30.137 --> 22:33.972
the Canadians, stick handling
neatly, get it over the line.

22:33.974 --> 22:36.406
Bouchard gets a big pass from
Blake.

22:36.408 --> 22:37.942
He sends the shot away,

22:37.944 --> 22:39.877
and the puck goes into the
corner.

22:39.879 --> 22:41.546
Bouchard pinches in, gets the
stick on it,

22:41.548 --> 22:43.882
fires it back down into the
corner.

22:43.884 --> 22:44.950
Blake's the first on it.

22:44.952 --> 22:47.551
He stops, looks, and
passes to Medea in the slot.

22:47.553 --> 22:48.886
It's intercepted by Colleta but
he's

22:48.888 --> 22:51.321
tied up by.

22:51.323 --> 22:53.390
Hamilton tries to help 'em out,
Pallas,

22:53.392 --> 22:55.559
but before he can clear Blake
keeps it in.

23:05.805 --> 23:08.174
and defense lining up against.

26:06.485 --> 26:10.090
You will take the extra...

26:40.719 --> 26:42.552
Incoming!

26:42.554 --> 26:43.654
Take cover!

26:48.028 --> 26:49.292
Move, move, move!

32:00.005 --> 32:02.106
Rothach, Rothach!

32:02.108 --> 32:03.874
Machine gun squad, 10 o'clock!

32:03.876 --> 32:06.042
I need you and your squad on me.

32:06.044 --> 32:07.848
First Squad, on me!

32:11.484 --> 32:13.954
Get the lead out.

32:18.090 --> 32:19.525
Go, go, go, go.

32:49.688 --> 32:53.156
Stay down, we're
gonna get you to safety!

32:53.158 --> 32:56.726
Fire team, get ready
to support our movement.

32:59.799 --> 33:02.336
- Go!
- Fisher, Painter, up!

33:14.813 --> 33:17.147
Lieutenant!

33:30.429 --> 33:31.430
Open fire!

33:42.041 --> 33:42.908
Shit!

33:50.515 --> 33:53.652
Fall back, everyone, fall back,
on me!

33:59.826 --> 34:01.094
Go, go, go, go!

34:45.904 --> 34:47.871
water.

35:19.871 --> 35:20.837
Huh?

35:20.839 --> 35:21.704
Huh?

36:15.828 --> 36:17.297
Suppressing fire!

36:18.264 --> 36:19.566
Almost out!

36:23.868 --> 36:28.007
Sarge, we're almost out, we...

36:32.612 --> 36:34.714
Medic, Medic!

36:47.893 --> 36:49.393
Here they come!

37:00.873 --> 37:02.609
Grenade!

37:06.911 --> 37:09.648
Nice throw, Sarge.

37:10.281 --> 37:12.248
Rothach, where's Lambert?

37:12.250 --> 37:14.918
Dead, we have to
fall back and consolidate.

37:14.920 --> 37:15.786
We were able to push them back,

37:15.788 --> 37:17.387
but those Panzers are coming in
quick.

37:17.389 --> 37:18.588
They're gonna break through.

37:18.590 --> 37:21.391
Reinforcements are inbound,
armor and tank destroyers.

37:21.393 --> 37:23.761
You hold this position.

37:23.763 --> 37:27.797
- Where's Captain Farley?
- I have no idea!

37:27.799 --> 37:28.998
You guys stay right here

37:29.000 --> 37:31.969
until I figure out what's going
on.

37:31.971 --> 37:33.770
What are we doin',
Sarge?

37:33.772 --> 37:35.405
You just keep your eye on the
sector.

37:35.407 --> 37:38.275
- We have to hold the line!
- Come on!

40:26.911 --> 40:28.311
And then he tells me in
French,

40:28.313 --> 40:30.447
that he wants to give me a kiss,
'whoa, easy'.

40:32.317 --> 40:34.384
So anyway, I uh, I finally made
it back

40:34.386 --> 40:37.855
and everything turned
out better than expected.

40:37.857 --> 40:41.858
This is really great, Barbara,
you've outdone yourself.

40:41.860 --> 40:43.927
Hell, every time Shirley makes a
roast

40:43.929 --> 40:46.331
it comes out like an old shoe.

40:48.601 --> 40:51.400
I have to get the
recipe for these potatoes.

40:51.402 --> 40:53.237
Do you still have the victory
garden in the backyard?

40:53.239 --> 40:56.038
Absolutely, this year's
harvest was magnificent.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.174
Hmm, I can imagine.

40:57.176 --> 40:59.509
Bill, we should give them
some of our raspberry jam.

40:59.511 --> 41:03.447
Definitely, more than
we'll ever be able to use.

41:03.449 --> 41:06.049
So, Roland, how are you
adjusting to life back home?

41:06.051 --> 41:08.384
- Settlin' in all right?
- He's doing just fine.

41:08.386 --> 41:13.090
Got him a job workin'
with me, good hard labor.

41:13.092 --> 41:15.592
If the war didn't do it, we'll
make a man out of him yet.

41:15.594 --> 41:17.527
Not as much adventure as you're
used to though, I imagine.

41:17.529 --> 41:19.563
No, not so much.

41:19.565 --> 41:22.565
Not as many Krauts, eh
Roly?

41:22.567 --> 41:23.634
- Not quite.
- There's always

41:23.636 --> 41:26.168
a spot for you back at the
paper.

41:26.170 --> 41:27.873
- Great.
- You know,

41:28.907 --> 41:31.007
when you're ready.

41:31.009 --> 41:33.911
It must be nice
though, to be back home?

41:33.913 --> 41:35.344
Hard, I imagine.

41:35.346 --> 41:36.579
How do you cope after witnessing

41:36.581 --> 41:39.081
all that needless death and
destruction?

41:39.083 --> 41:40.349
You fellas must've seen so much.

41:40.351 --> 41:42.953
Oh, I don't know if I'd say
needless.

41:42.955 --> 41:45.956
Jesus, Pearl Harbor, Billy.

41:45.958 --> 41:47.991
Well, It just seemed
there was a lot of waste

41:47.993 --> 41:50.460
in terms of innocent lives.

41:50.462 --> 41:51.328
Not to mention the toll it took

41:51.330 --> 41:54.197
on foreign infrastructure and
economy.

41:54.199 --> 41:57.199
I mean, they're still eating
their horses in Amsterdam.

41:57.201 --> 42:01.605
Oh, sunshine and rainbows
and ponies for all.

42:01.607 --> 42:04.675
They started the fight, we ended
it.

42:04.677 --> 42:06.442
There's gonna be some bloody
noses.

42:06.444 --> 42:09.212
But look at our economy
here at home, it's booming.

42:09.214 --> 42:11.181
Nobody could have predicted
that 10 years ago.

42:11.183 --> 42:12.549
We defended our way of life,

42:12.551 --> 42:14.284
- and were rewarded for it.
- Can we go play?

42:14.286 --> 42:15.251
- Sure honey.
- Yeah, can we, Mom?

42:15.253 --> 42:16.453
Did you finish your dinner?

42:16.455 --> 42:18.458
- Yeah.
- Okay, go ahead.

42:19.424 --> 42:21.190
It was our responsibility
to throw our helmets

42:21.192 --> 42:22.659
into the ring, so to speak.

42:22.661 --> 42:23.860
Then why didn't we take
action

42:23.862 --> 42:28.065
- until after Pearl Harbor?
- Sorry, where did you fight?

42:28.067 --> 42:31.300
Well, I signed up,
but they deemed me unfit

42:31.302 --> 42:33.603
for military service due
to an inner ear problem.

42:33.605 --> 42:35.739
Inner ear problem?

42:35.741 --> 42:39.442
- What the fuck is that?
- Roger, language.

42:39.444 --> 42:40.744
It affects my balance.

42:40.746 --> 42:43.713
He can hardly walk some days.

42:43.715 --> 42:46.183
I think that what Bill's
trying to say is that

42:46.185 --> 42:47.616
we could have taken a
more humanitarian role

42:47.618 --> 42:49.485
in dealing with the civilian
population.

42:49.487 --> 42:51.054
We'll ask women about war

42:51.056 --> 42:53.056
if one ever breaks out in the
kitchen.

42:53.058 --> 42:54.757
We're deviating from the
point.

42:54.759 --> 42:56.360
Trudy used to work
at one of the factories

42:56.362 --> 42:58.395
- that made the bullets.
- Oh, I agree.

42:58.397 --> 43:01.697
The point is, if it wasn't
for Marines like myself

43:01.699 --> 43:03.632
out there burnin' those sneaky
slant-eyes

43:03.634 --> 43:06.203
out of holes day and night, I
guarantee

43:06.205 --> 43:09.038
there'd be moldy rice on this
table,

43:09.040 --> 43:11.741
not a goddamn roast dinner,
Semper Fi!

43:11.743 --> 43:13.242
You realize the war wasn't
just fought

43:13.244 --> 43:14.777
on a handful of islands in the
Pacific.

43:14.779 --> 43:17.480
The Pacific was our war.

43:17.482 --> 43:21.650
- Europe was a picnic compared to the hell we endured.
- Picnic...

43:21.652 --> 43:24.054
We just bailed them out
of a tough situation.

43:24.056 --> 43:26.056
If boots on the ground were
so important in the Pacific,

43:26.058 --> 43:27.556
then why did it take two atomic
bombs

43:27.558 --> 43:29.092
before they surrendered?

43:29.094 --> 43:31.194
And we don't agree with
the bomb, do we Bill?

43:31.196 --> 43:32.195
Of course not.

43:32.197 --> 43:34.563
So many innocent lives
lost, and for what gain?

43:34.565 --> 43:35.699
For what gain?

43:35.701 --> 43:37.233
Are you out of your fuckin'
mind?

43:37.235 --> 43:39.503
- Roger!
- I'll tell you for what gain.

43:39.505 --> 43:43.643
Have you ever looked one of
these greasy Nips in the eye?

43:50.315 --> 43:54.217
Roland, what do you
think about all this?

43:54.219 --> 43:57.623
Now what?

44:04.096 --> 44:05.529
Oh my God, what happened?

44:05.531 --> 44:08.000
- Toby bit me.
- Let me see.

44:09.802 --> 44:13.270
- I'll go get you a cloth.
- Call Dr. Brown.

44:13.272 --> 44:17.076
It could be infected,
what if she has rabies?

44:17.810 --> 44:19.208
Look at what your vicious mutt
did!

44:19.210 --> 44:22.279
I'm so sorry, usually he's so
friendly.

44:22.281 --> 44:23.646
So, what, you're saying
this is Liz's fault?

44:23.648 --> 44:25.081
- She's six.
- Dogs like that

44:25.083 --> 44:27.250
should be locked up in a cage.

44:27.252 --> 44:29.518
You're right, I'm sorry,
is there anything I can do?

44:29.520 --> 44:33.658
We're leaving.

45:39.458 --> 45:41.491
Christ!

46:32.377 --> 46:33.976
Keep firing!

46:33.978 --> 46:34.846
Rothach!

46:36.681 --> 46:38.415
Rothach, where's Lieutenant
Lambert?

46:38.417 --> 46:40.349
- Dead, sir.
- Shit!

46:40.351 --> 46:41.518
What about Pyne?

46:41.520 --> 46:42.518
He was looking for you, sir,

46:42.520 --> 46:43.686
I think he's in the 1st platoon.

46:43.688 --> 46:47.523
I just came from there,
1st platoon's been overrun.

46:47.525 --> 46:50.594
What are your orders,
sir?

46:50.596 --> 46:51.795
Sir!

46:51.797 --> 46:54.697
I've gotta go find Pyne.

46:56.335 --> 46:58.503
Here they come!

47:09.781 --> 47:10.713
Oh, goddammit, all right.

47:10.715 --> 47:13.583
First squad, fall back to that
position.

47:13.585 --> 47:16.353
Inglis, check that .30 cal,
make sure it's still workin'.

47:16.355 --> 47:18.922
Second squad, provide
suppressing fire.

47:18.924 --> 47:20.623
Then we'll cover you.

47:20.625 --> 47:22.259
- Fields!
- Yes, Sarge?

47:22.261 --> 47:23.793
Can Austin
move, we gotta go right now!

47:23.795 --> 47:24.728
I can't make it, Sarge.

47:24.730 --> 47:28.297
Let's move, we gotta pull out
right now!

47:28.299 --> 47:29.933
All right, let's do it!

47:29.935 --> 47:30.802
Let's go!

47:31.636 --> 47:34.371
Come on,.

47:34.373 --> 47:35.704
Let's go, let's go.

47:35.706 --> 47:37.974
Come on now, go, go go.

48:04.536 --> 48:06.304
Come to me.

48:54.418 --> 48:56.353
Where are you?

52:16.020 --> 52:17.856
Bill Baker, please.

52:20.324 --> 52:21.590
Bill?

52:21.592 --> 52:23.125
It's Roland.

52:23.127 --> 52:25.828
Yes, hello.

52:25.830 --> 52:26.831
How are you?

52:27.831 --> 52:29.831
Oh, good, that's good to hear.

52:29.833 --> 52:33.973
I'm okay, I've
been, uh, writing a book.

53:00.998 --> 53:01.866
Hello?

53:03.101 --> 53:04.733
Hello?

53:04.735 --> 53:05.603
Sorry.

53:06.705 --> 53:08.574
I just wanted to call.

53:10.641 --> 53:11.310
I mean,

53:12.143 --> 53:15.113
I just wanted to see how you
were.

53:17.248 --> 53:18.250
That's good.

53:21.953 --> 53:24.590
I got my job back at the paper.

53:25.389 --> 53:27.326
Yeah, I talked to Bill.

53:28.259 --> 53:31.797
I was gonna see if maybe I could
see you.

53:34.331 --> 53:37.802
I just have some things I wanted
to say.

53:41.005 --> 53:45.143
I just wanted to say some
things that you should hear.

53:49.214 --> 53:51.713
I'd really like to see you.

53:51.715 --> 53:53.851
And James, too, of course.

53:57.154 --> 53:59.721
Downtown, on Monday?

53:59.723 --> 54:01.626
Grant Park, all right.

54:03.795 --> 54:04.663
Great.

54:06.897 --> 54:08.299
I'll see you then.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.547
All right, second squad, fall
back!

56:04.549 --> 56:06.315
Covering fire!

56:06.317 --> 56:07.817
Aw, fuck it.

56:29.174 --> 56:32.311
- This is FUBAR.
- I know, what do you need?

56:33.310 --> 56:36.045
Charlie Company has fallen
back it back to CP.

56:36.047 --> 56:39.514
Farley took off
towards first platoon.

56:39.516 --> 56:40.449
I gotta get a radio.

56:40.451 --> 56:42.250
You think you can hold on till I
get back?

56:42.252 --> 56:43.119
We'll give it our best shot.

56:43.121 --> 56:44.920
I'm counting on you.

56:45.989 --> 56:46.859
Medic!

56:49.326 --> 56:51.059
Oh God!

56:51.061 --> 56:51.929
Medic!

56:53.431 --> 56:54.299
Oh, God.

56:59.270 --> 57:00.469
- Patch me up!
- Medic!

57:00.471 --> 57:04.275
Roly? Roly they're coming!

57:10.181 --> 57:12.081
Fuck, fuck!

57:12.083 --> 57:13.185
I'm tryin'!

57:14.286 --> 57:16.886
Fuck, fucking
cocksucker, patch me up!

57:16.888 --> 57:18.253
Calm down.

57:18.255 --> 57:21.958
Doc, can you,

57:21.960 --> 57:24.096
I need my gun! They're coming!

57:26.431 --> 57:28.300
Fuck, you I'm dying!

57:29.266 --> 57:31.967
They're coming, they're coming!

57:31.969 --> 57:34.003
Oh no, oh my God!

57:34.005 --> 57:36.172
- I don't wanna die!
- Hold on, hold on, Hendricks!

57:36.174 --> 57:37.509
- They're coming!
- Stop

57:39.009 --> 57:40.175
you're overexerting
and that's just gonna make you-

57:42.547 --> 57:45.081
Roly, Roly, fuck!

57:48.552 --> 57:50.119
- It's okay!
- Roly, Roly!

57:50.121 --> 57:51.123
- Roly.
- Help.

57:52.257 --> 57:53.192
Help, help.

58:06.203 --> 58:08.570
Coming to you over
WAAF,

58:08.572 --> 58:12.109
operating on 1120 kilocycles,
267 meters,

58:13.911 --> 58:17.313
as authorized by the
Federal Radio Commission.

58:17.315 --> 58:19.047
And now the program continues

58:19.049 --> 58:21.416
with Mr. Scott and Mr.
Greenfield

59:44.034 --> 59:47.203
Roly?

59:50.074 --> 59:51.510
What are you doing?

59:56.014 --> 59:57.112
How was your day?

01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:08.324
James'll be home
soon.

01:00:08.326 --> 01:00:12.128
Roland!

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:14.130
What are you doing, stop,
Roland!

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:15.364
Stop it!

01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:17.333
Get off of me, Roland

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:21.469
Stop it, don't!

01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:23.207
Get off me, stop it!

01:00:39.089 --> 01:00:42.224
I'm home!

01:02:52.322 --> 01:02:55.359
Soldier, get battalion on the
horn!

01:02:58.228 --> 01:03:00.962
Danger Forward, this is Danger
Red Dog Two, over.

01:03:00.964 --> 01:03:03.699
Danger Forward, come in please,
over.

01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:09.273
Fuck.

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:13.241
Second platoon, fall back on me!

01:03:13.243 --> 01:03:14.578
Move, move, move!

01:04:23.647 --> 01:04:24.515
Oh, no.

01:04:38.696 --> 01:04:39.563
Come on.

01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:41.416
I want you to be
the man I fell in love with.

01:06:41.418 --> 01:06:43.819
I want James to have a father.

01:06:43.821 --> 01:06:45.119
You wanna see what I
am?

01:06:45.121 --> 01:06:46.087
What are you doing?

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.121
You wanna see what
I've become?

01:06:47.123 --> 01:06:50.025
- Roland, stop it!
- I'm nothing! I'm nothing!

01:09:05.161 --> 01:09:06.563
What are doing?

01:09:07.263 --> 01:09:11.064
No, no, no!

01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:15.104
Shit.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.859
- Sarge, what are we doin'?
- Can anyone get Austin?

01:09:39.862 --> 01:09:41.261
Where the hell is
everybody?

01:09:55.879 --> 01:09:59.247
- Get Austin,
- I can't get to him!

01:09:59.249 --> 01:10:01.953
- Fischer, get out there
- Get rid of it!

01:12:33.402 --> 01:12:35.272
Hey, halt!

01:12:47.817 --> 01:12:48.884
Fall back!

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:51.188
Everyone fall back to the CP!

01:12:54.258 --> 01:12:55.791
Hey, fucking come back!

01:12:55.793 --> 01:12:56.994
Don't fucking leave! Don't-

01:13:18.514 --> 01:13:22.853
Halt!

01:15:44.393 --> 01:15:47.461
- Stop!
- No!

01:15:47.463 --> 01:15:51.334
Shut up!

01:15:54.437 --> 01:15:58.109
They're coming.

01:15:59.343 --> 01:16:02.480
Sh, they're coming, sh, quiet, quiet.
Godammit

01:16:05.315 --> 01:16:06.549
They're coming.

01:16:10.454 --> 01:16:12.623
They're coming, sh, sh, sh.

01:17:25.829 --> 01:17:28.462
Don't shoot, I'm an American!

01:17:28.464 --> 01:17:31.332
I'm an American, don't shoot!

01:17:31.334 --> 01:17:32.203
American.

01:19:23.612 --> 01:19:24.514
I'm comin'.

01:19:29.686 --> 01:19:33.624
Morning, Mr. Rothach,
how are you today, sir?

01:19:39.361 --> 01:19:40.595
You okay, sir?

01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:15.953
Hello?

01:22:18.053 --> 01:22:18.922
Hello?

01:27:20.288 --> 01:27:25.288
