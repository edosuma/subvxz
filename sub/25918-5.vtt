WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:13.221
On this episode,
we're off to California wine country...

00:13.304 --> 00:15.598
I love being on a vineyard.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.226
...where we're going to help
this vineyard cottage.

00:18.309 --> 00:22.022
It almost feels like everywhere else
on your property is better than here.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.273
Right!

00:23.773 --> 00:26.151
Currently,
it feels like a leftover junk drawer.

00:26.234 --> 00:29.612
We need to change this into
a business instead of just a spare room.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.324
By the time we're finished,
she's going to be so pretty.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.953
This will be ultimate vacation rental
for wine lovers...

00:37.037 --> 00:40.248
-Cheers!
-...and destination weddings.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.207
Oh, my God!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.918
-I would stay here.
-I'd stay here too.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.818 --> 01:12.363
This is the one place
that we're going that I've never been.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.990
I mean, look at it, Peter.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
-It's a storybook.
-It's stunning!

01:19.329 --> 01:22.207
Paso Robles,
a beautiful little community

01:22.290 --> 01:24.250
in the central coast of California.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.796
People come from around the world
for wine tasting,

01:27.879 --> 01:30.173
fine dining, and destination weddings,

01:30.256 --> 01:34.260
making it a very profitable destination
for vacation rental owners.

01:39.891 --> 01:43.186
Oh, my God. This road...
It's like we're in Italy. This is great.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.188
The landscapes are stunning.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.817
Two of the top 25 wines
in Wine Spectator magazine

01:49.317 --> 01:50.777
are from Paso Robles.

01:50.860 --> 01:55.615
And for the international crowd,
six out of the top 100.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.325
-In the world?
-In the world!

01:57.408 --> 01:58.910
-Are from here.
-Yeah.

01:59.452 --> 02:03.373
This small-town farm area has
approximately 200 short-term rentals

02:03.456 --> 02:06.876
and managed to generate about
$7 million last year.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.882
There! There's the entrance
to the Vintage Ranch.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.597
Wow!

02:20.014 --> 02:21.307
Not bad.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.561
I love being on a vineyard.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.897
This view is ridiculous.

02:29.023 --> 02:32.944
-What a magnificent oak tree.
-It's pretty marvelous.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.321
The cottage is just over there.

02:35.738 --> 02:39.159
I mean, the land does the most work
in this project.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.995
But the story is just not getting told.

02:42.078 --> 02:45.331
-Not on the web site.
-Let's look at the web site.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.791
The Vintage Ranch Cottage.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.628
It's a cozy 300 square foot cottage
with one bedroom and one bath.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.131
Going through all of the pictures
and the photos,

02:53.214 --> 02:54.966
it feels like somebody's spare room.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.844
As a short-term rental, I think "dated."

02:57.927 --> 03:01.472
Right. A large part of their business
here is weddings.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.099
-Mm-hmm.
-They have weddings on property.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.934
The bride and groom
stay in the cottage.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.395
Would you want to spend
your wedding there now?

03:07.478 --> 03:09.981
I would not. It's not very inviting.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.941
It's definitely not sexy.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.361
"Come and stay in our junk drawer.
But here's a beautiful wedding."

03:15.445 --> 03:19.782
So we have to really marry the land
with this house

03:19.866 --> 03:22.660
in a way that feels completely romantic.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.289
The design needs to embody this.
The marketing needs to embody this.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.499
It's all here. We just need to dig it out.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.627
So you ready to go see this thing?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.296
The rain is coming.
It's probably time to get in.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.317
First impressions
are absolutely everything.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.653
The way it's decorated... outdated.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.072
It definitely feels... worn.

03:59.155 --> 04:02.116
The potential of the property
is A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.076
Mm-hmm.

04:03.159 --> 04:06.246
-The current execution...
-C-minus!

04:08.081 --> 04:09.832
-Hi, guys!
-Hello!

04:09.916 --> 04:11.918
-Nice to meet you.
-What's up, Curtis?

04:12.001 --> 04:14.671
-My name's Sonja Lockshaw.
-My name's Curtis Lockshaw.

04:14.754 --> 04:20.176
And we have a 66-acre property with
a 40-acre vineyard and vacation rental.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.471
You did what many of us in the city
want to do.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.391
You packed up, moved off to the country.

04:26.474 --> 04:30.895
We're from Orange County. We'd been
coming up here for years visiting.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.523
We fell in love with it.
Country living ever since.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.568
So we have a working vineyard
as well as a guest cottage.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.404
Also our wedding business.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.949
That's a lot of business on one property.
How is it for the relationship?

04:43.032 --> 04:45.868
It's 24-7... for 20 years.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.620
-And here you are.
-Here we are.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.163
Each other's best friends.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.207
Bravo. You have to be, right?
To do this?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.084
Where do you need the most help?

04:53.167 --> 04:56.296
Our real goal is to
increase our occupancy.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.924
-What are you at right now?
-We're at about 25 percent.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.469
-We have a lot of empty nights.
-We have about 30 weekends available

05:03.553 --> 05:06.264
that we would be happy
to rent the cottage for.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.183
I have lots of ideas of
how to increase that occupancy

05:09.267 --> 05:12.061
-and achieve your goals.
-We're excited.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.273
-What are people using this area for?
-Not much.

05:15.356 --> 05:20.111
We put this together
with everything we could find.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.696
-The leftovers.
-The leftovers.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.574
As we say in England,
a bit higgledy-piggledy.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.077
-Couldn't have said it better.
-There! Glad you know what I mean.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.497
The thing about California is,
it's indoor-outdoor living.

05:31.622 --> 05:36.419
And right now, this outdoors
is not drawing me out from the cottage.

05:36.502 --> 05:40.548
When there is an event going on,
where are they in this area?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.885
The fence blocks everybody off.
They're never over here.

05:44.010 --> 05:48.431
So, fence gone, this is opened up,
this whole area right here

05:48.514 --> 05:51.851
becomes something
kind of seductive and beautiful.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.144
-Hallelujah.
-Now we're talking.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.520
Right?

05:54.604 --> 05:59.400
We run a little decking
right off of this little platform of sorts

05:59.484 --> 06:01.235
to put some furniture on.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.864
People will gather to this little platform
as kind of the VIP section.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.242
So when they're having a glass of wine
looking yonder

06:08.326 --> 06:10.411
at the beautiful sunsets over the hills,

06:10.495 --> 06:14.624
what are they gonna be doing?
They're taking social media photographs

06:14.707 --> 06:20.004
and posting them everywhere, which
drives business to you through hashtags.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.798
Right.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.096
Do you have a hashtag?

06:29.347 --> 06:32.016
-I think I have a hashtag.
-You don't have a hashtag.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.731
The hashtag
is when you want to tag a category.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.025
When you click on that,
it opens up

06:41.109 --> 06:44.320
everyone who's put that hashtag
on their photos ever.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.238
Oh.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.282
When you're doing a post here,
you would do #VintageRanch.

06:48.366 --> 06:52.203
And you have a bulletin board full
of beautiful photography taken for you.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.539
-Wow.
-Let's go check the inside. Come on.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.626
Well, I'm walkin' right into my bed.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.632
-That's an interesting space plan.
-Yeah, not so good.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.344
So we've got bedroom...
and then through the archway,

07:08.428 --> 07:11.222
kitchenette and a little seating area

07:11.347 --> 07:13.224
So you guys do weddings here.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.477
All of the getting ready,
makeup, getting the dress on,

07:16.561 --> 07:19.063
-that usually happens in here.
-Right here.

07:19.147 --> 07:24.360
-Is this a VHS? Sweet.
-We took the 8-track out.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.278
It has to go.

07:25.361 --> 07:29.657
It feels like your spare room
as opposed to a small business,

07:29.740 --> 07:32.076
which is separate to your residence.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.747
I see here you have a bunch of
higgledy-piggledy events and stuff...

07:37.623 --> 07:42.587
I like the fact that you've got this,
but I need it to be more thought out.

07:42.670 --> 07:47.467
Consider that you are now both GMs
of a really small hotel.

07:47.842 --> 07:52.430
When we first set up our guest cottage,
it was for family and friends,

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
and they loved it.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.101
We made the mistake of thinking

07:57.185 --> 08:01.981
that paying guests would love it
as much as our family and friends.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.442
Ready to look at the rest of the house?

08:04.525 --> 08:05.860
-Let's go.
-Okay.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.945
One, two. Here we are.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.406
-We're in.
-The rest of the house.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.368
Look at this range.

08:14.452 --> 08:18.706
Not only can you wash your dishes,
but you can cook them, too.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.666
In the same spot.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.418
And keep it cold.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.379
-Oh, my God. That's the fridge too?
-That's the fridge!

08:25.463 --> 08:29.884
Obviously we're a little bit of
an outdated moment in the kitchen, right?

08:30.134 --> 08:33.763
Imagine if you walked in a hotel room
and everything was 10 years old.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.139
Right.

08:35.222 --> 08:39.936
I'm guessing that the biggest
guest complaint in this cottage

08:40.019 --> 08:41.729
is this area right here.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.980
-Right.
-What do they say?

08:43.063 --> 08:45.942
No refrigerator space. Number one.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.235
And no counter space.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.279
Structurally, I'd love to move the door
from the bedroom...

08:50.780 --> 08:52.615
-to the middle of this room.
-Right.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.493
And... new colors throughout, yeah?

08:55.576 --> 08:57.411
Let's lighten this lady up.

09:05.253 --> 09:09.131
Okay, we've seen the cottage.
We've seen the vineyard.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.424
What are your goals?

09:10.508 --> 09:15.596
A nice little profit center at the guest
house would basically-- Servicing debt.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.265
Mm-hmm. Farm debt.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.142
-That every farmer has to deal with.
-Absolutely.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.936
It would be to have enough money

09:22.019 --> 09:25.606
to take care of projects that have
been sitting on hold for years.

09:25.690 --> 09:29.151
This is a big property,
and it needs a big input of upkeep.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.404
Then that will free you up
to actually

09:31.487 --> 09:33.698
go experience something
other than the farm.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.825
-That would be good.
-Exciting.

09:35.908 --> 09:40.788
Going through the numbers, it seems that
you're approximately 25 percent occupancy.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.916
-And you're charging how much a night?
-$250 a night.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.919
Okay. So, let's talk competition.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.755
Your direct competition are 1-bedrooms.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.759
You've got one that's renting
at $245 a night that is completely redone.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.929
New kitchen, new bathroom, new flooring
new windows, new paint.

09:57.013 --> 10:01.684
Their occupancy's at 75 percent.
Their marketing is on point.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.520
But all of your competition,

10:04.604 --> 10:08.316
all they have is the four walls
and what's inside the house.

10:08.399 --> 10:13.821
They don't have a story like this.
They don't have 40 acres of vineyard.

10:13.904 --> 10:17.283
They don't have miles of hiking,
mountain biking.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.953
It's endless. This, to me,
is not just a vacation rental.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.247
In a way, this is a resort.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.042
Can we add some value
because they're awesome?

10:26.584 --> 10:29.587
-Without a doubt.
-They're worth at least 10 more a night.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.424
I wanna talk about the business plan.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.217
Based on the comps in the area,

10:35.301 --> 10:39.513
you're charging $250 a night
at approximately 25 percent occupancy.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.432
That's roughly eight nights a month,

10:41.682 --> 10:46.270
So that means you're generating
$2,000 a month, or $24,000 a year.

10:46.854 --> 10:52.443
I cannot see there is any reason
why we cannot double that.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.907
Conservatively, I think we can double your
occupancy and still charge $250 a night.

10:57.990 --> 11:02.870
So that's about 16 nights a month
for a monthly income of about $4,000

11:02.953 --> 11:06.666
and a yearly income
of approximately $48,000.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.669
And the way we're going to get you
to those numbers

11:10.086 --> 11:13.964
is we are going to completely redo
your marketing.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.843
Gen is going to do a total redo
of the cottage,

11:17.927 --> 11:20.388
and we're going to find
all the experiences

11:20.471 --> 11:22.014
this property has to offer.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.015
Phenomenal.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.227
I look at it, and I just can't wait
to get my hands on it.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.770
-Sound good?
-Yeah.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.605
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.033
For the Vintage Ranch to succeed,
we need to help Sonja and Curtis

11:41.117 --> 11:42.952
modernize their vineyard rental.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.872
To do that, Genevieve is going to update
the tired, old cottage kitchen

11:46.956 --> 11:50.418
and increase the overall space
by creating an outdoor living area.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.586
Then, we'll explore the vineyard

11:52.670 --> 11:55.089
to see what experiences
can be offered to their guests

11:55.172 --> 11:56.924
that the competition cannot.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.094
Finally, we'll introduce them
to digital marketing

12:00.177 --> 12:02.972
and how it can help promote
their rustic lifestyle.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.444
Work is underway.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.071
Before we bring in the new,
we have to take out the old.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.656
Adios.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.951
I want that big boy out of here.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.077
Get this guy...

12:25.161 --> 12:27.830
-She hates this fence...
-I hate this fence so much.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.373
You want this?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.000
You go first.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.543
Damn fence!

12:33.169 --> 12:35.713
Wow. I didn't know you had it in ya!

12:35.838 --> 12:37.131
Ah, hallelujah.

12:37.214 --> 12:41.969
This is the perfect segue to free you
from doing work for once.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.138
No more manual labor.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.682
She's gonna be so pretty. Just wait.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.192
We've got major landscaping underway,

12:56.275 --> 12:58.444
the framework for a fire pit and a deck,

12:58.527 --> 13:00.905
and demolition going on
inside the cottage.

13:00.988 --> 13:05.201
I want to create a cottage anyone getting
married would feel honored to be in.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.953
A bit like
they're part of some vineyard fantasy.

13:08.204 --> 13:13.000
Light, clean colors, a throne of a bed
made from vintage wood found on the farm.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.795
Pretty, ethereal, and super sweet.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.507
For the exterior, we need to create
some kind of big deck platform

13:19.590 --> 13:21.550
for entertaining all of their guests,

13:21.634 --> 13:25.429
with room to wander, gather by the fire,
and of course, drink wine.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.308
All of this work is going to take us
well into the night.

13:37.608 --> 13:38.901
Yes!

13:39.193 --> 13:40.486
Wow!

13:41.195 --> 13:44.490
-You guys move quick! What a difference!
-These guys are fast.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.992
So what's going on?
What changes are happening?

13:47.076 --> 13:49.328
All right, all right.
This was the front door.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.413
-Right.
-This is gonna be Sheetrocked over.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.041
It's gonna be a wall now.
The bed is going here.

13:54.124 --> 13:57.503
All right? And the front door is moving...

13:58.087 --> 13:59.338
to right here.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.841
This door moves
all the way down to here.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.343
We're going to get new bases,
new counter top.

14:04.426 --> 14:08.347
We're going to run a galley kitchen,
so there'll be two sides of counter top.

14:08.430 --> 14:12.685
So now in this bedroom,
I have long bed, bedside tables

14:12.768 --> 14:14.895
lamps, artwork,

14:15.354 --> 14:19.608
artwork, mirrors, bridal dress stand.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.903
Perfect for brides getting ready
for their big day. Voila.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.904
I love it.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.043
Your landscape is like
driving through a painting.

14:38.919 --> 14:44.550
We love the feel that when you get here,
everything slows down.

14:45.259 --> 14:49.346
It's a different lifestyle here.
We're only three miles from Paso Robles.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.184
When designing a small rental
in a small town,

14:54.268 --> 14:57.229
I want to make sure that we use
local vintage stores

14:57.313 --> 14:59.648
to furnish the cottage to feel special.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.485
So I'm taking Sonja shopping
in downtown Paso Robles.

15:05.029 --> 15:08.616
-You have so many cute homeware stores.
-Yeah.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.452
-There's a real culture here.
-Right.

15:11.535 --> 15:15.456
You have all the old architecture,
and it's preserved.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.751
This is a good store.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.963
-You are called the Vintage Ranch.
-Right.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.883
I think we absolutely need to answer that
through object.

15:25.966 --> 15:29.887
Not just old but intentionally vintage.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.265
Anything tickling you
that you're seeing right now?

15:35.434 --> 15:38.437
-It's an old outdoor sink.
-Uh-huh. Laundry tub.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.022
-Oh, my gosh.
-You like it.

15:40.105 --> 15:40.940
I love it!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.775
-Is that giving you feelings?
-Yes.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.401
What does it remind you of?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.904
Grandparents. Grandparents and...

15:47.363 --> 15:49.782
being a child and bathing in it.

15:49.865 --> 15:53.702
This is a moment that you give to a guest
to have that moment.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.287
-Okay.
-Immediately...

15:55.496 --> 15:59.667
I think... outdoor... piles of ice.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.962
-Bottles of wine...
-Oh, wedding... yes.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.297
Wedding on that deck we're building
out front.

16:13.681 --> 16:18.268
This rural county generated
$1.5 billion in tourism last year.

16:18.894 --> 16:22.898
The area offers a variety of attractions
like private wine tastings...

16:23.023 --> 16:24.441
To successful new business.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.777
...and booze buses to ziplines,

16:28.862 --> 16:30.322
And to helicopter tours.

16:30.906 --> 16:34.451
Today, I'm going to have Curtis take me
around his property

16:34.535 --> 16:38.664
so we can curate experiences
that he can give to his guests.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.292
I don't know too much about farming,
Curtis.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.420
I am your city boy.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.799
-How many vines do you have?
-About 27,000 vines.

16:48.882 --> 16:51.301
Can you show me the basics
of how to prune a vine?

16:51.385 --> 16:56.015
We cut everything off
except for the first two buds here.

16:56.098 --> 16:56.932
Oh, wow.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.852
Little bud down here,
and the second one is right there.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.687
Oh, God. Here we go.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.565
-There we go.
-That's not bad. Pretty good.

17:04.647 --> 17:10.863
If this was part of the marketing package,
come and learn how to prune vines,

17:10.945 --> 17:16.577
learn everything about California wine
from a California wine vineyard farmer,

17:16.660 --> 17:18.287
people are gonna drive up.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.539
I've never considered that.
Not a bad idea.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.374
-It's a great experience.
-Yeah.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.044
Instead of sending them out
to the local vineyards,

17:25.127 --> 17:28.047
have a wine tasting night
under the old oak tree.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.799
The potential for profit here is endless.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.926
-Will you take some pictures?
-Take a picture.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.220
I'm doing what the tourists would do.

17:44.104 --> 17:46.231
You're almost done with our new headboard.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.859
So, this came from
an old horse corral on the property.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.570
As you can see,
it's weathered quite nicely, right?

17:51.653 --> 17:55.532
Natural patinas, and I like the modulation
between each board, so it gives depth.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.367
Bedding will be all white linens,

17:57.451 --> 18:00.245
but we're bringing in
these Moroccan highlights.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.207
The balance between the rusticity here

18:03.290 --> 18:06.085
and the elegance of this
is a really nice pairing,

18:06.168 --> 18:07.711
and with a graceful arch, boom.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.547
So this will be
the throne of the bedroom.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.550
And I do think it is the first thing
that guests look at

18:13.634 --> 18:15.677
when they're looking
at properties to stay in.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.640
And it has a story
that it came from the land, which I like

18:19.723 --> 18:20.724
Right.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.479
We are deep into work
on our vineyard rental.

18:26.021 --> 18:29.483
We have a new deck, a new fire pit.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.152
And a new kitchen going in.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.822
This is going to be
the perfect destination

18:34.905 --> 18:36.949
for weddings and wine tastings.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.329
-Well, we got a new doorway. That's good.
-Yeah, yeah. It's great.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.415
So your daughter
was married here recently,

18:45.499 --> 18:46.625
Right. September.

18:46.708 --> 18:50.045
-And she got ready in the cottage.
-In this cottage, yeah.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.298
What was her experience like getting ready
in the cottage?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.425
Maybe there's stuff
I could take notes on.

18:55.509 --> 18:59.263
Yeah, it was pretty tough.
So the door was right there.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.057
You come in and the first thing
she'd ask was, "How do I look?"

19:02.141 --> 19:03.433
'cause there was no mirror.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.604
For the wedding party getting ready,
this will become all mirror.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.316
That's what you need
for one of the biggest days of your life.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.790
For Sonja and Curtis to attract
more brides and guests to the property,

19:26.874 --> 19:29.418
they need to create
a unique marketing platform.

19:29.501 --> 19:33.130
To launch this, I brought them to
a one-of-a-kind winery experience,

19:33.213 --> 19:35.924
a picnic in a heart-shaped oak grove

19:36.008 --> 19:38.760
where I'll introduce them to an expert
that can help.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.598
I'm so glad you brought us up here.
This is great.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.724
Right? Isn't it?

19:43.807 --> 19:47.811
So I brought someone along today
that I know you absolutely need to meet

19:47.895 --> 19:51.398
who can help you
with your photographs and video

19:51.481 --> 19:56.069
and blogging, which is the lifeblood
of how you find business.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.988
-So...
-Hey, Cameron.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.616
Cameron runs a really great web site
and a blog

20:00.699 --> 20:04.494
that focuses on weddings and tourism
for the central coast of California.

20:04.578 --> 20:05.913
I am so happy you're here!

20:06.663 --> 20:08.874
-I'm happy to be here.
-Blogging,

20:08.957 --> 20:13.545
when it's done in an authentic,
vulnerable, genuine way,

20:13.629 --> 20:17.674
is the most powerful tool
a marketer can have.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.343
-Would you agree?
-That's right.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.638
You really need to position your brand
as an expert.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.973
Maybe you don't feel like an expert,

20:25.057 --> 20:28.727
but if we photograph you having some wine,
and we put that on a blog post,

20:28.810 --> 20:32.940
they're going to see you as an expert
or a guide and they're going to trust you.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.025
When people see that you're real people,

20:35.275 --> 20:40.113
on a real farm, engaging
with your guests in real experiences,

20:40.197 --> 20:41.782
it makes them feel like they know you.

20:41.865 --> 20:45.160
I got to start taking more pictures
and saving and sharing them.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.913
What type of things
should they be blogging about?

20:47.996 --> 20:51.959
Well, I think you guys could blog
about anything that is local here

20:52.042 --> 20:54.836
to wine country, Paso Robles tourism.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.882
It's weddings, it's wine tasting.
It's Paso Robles itself.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.842
The problem I think you might have is

21:00.926 --> 21:03.804
all of your knowledge, your experience,
you take for granted

21:03.887 --> 21:05.555
-because it's every day.
-Good point.

21:05.639 --> 21:10.060
I get that it's a bit mystifying,
so Cameron is gonna blog for you

21:10.143 --> 21:11.728
-for six months...
-Oh, my gosh.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.230
-...for free.
-Oh, my gosh.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.315
-Oh, my gosh!
-You gotta be kidding me.

21:15.399 --> 21:19.528
Once you have a blog post,
think of it like it's a one-page book.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.198
Right? We're getting tears.
We're getting tears.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.284
Why are you crying, Sonja?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.411
Because I'm happy.

21:27.494 --> 21:32.541
I didn't know what we have
would be interesting to people,

21:32.624 --> 21:38.380
but I learned that that is wrong,
that what we have is interesting.

21:38.755 --> 21:43.135
We got an education in marketing,
and it's going to be successful,

21:43.677 --> 21:45.095
without a shadow of a doubt.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.973
You've got him for six months.
You've got my cell phone.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.268
What I'd like to do today,
'cause it's beautiful,

21:51.351 --> 21:54.104
and this is perfect,
let's do your very first blog post.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.315
-Right here, right now.
-Awesome.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.775
-You ready?
-I'm ready. Let's do this.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.527
-Cool.
-All I gotta do is eat?

22:00.610 --> 22:04.156
-All you gotta do is eat. That's it.
-I love this already!

22:04.865 --> 22:08.243
Just like you are is great.
Look at my lens. That's beautiful.

22:09.077 --> 22:10.704
Why don't we do a cheers?

22:10.787 --> 22:12.247
-Cheers, sweetie.
-Cheers.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.665
Yeah, that's awesome.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.719
-Wow!
-Like that?

22:26.178 --> 22:29.681
I've been out all day
and I've come back and it's, like, boom.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.933
-I've got your lights.
-Thank you. More lights.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.728
-And I got horseshoes.
-Thank you. Added value, right?

22:34.811 --> 22:38.148
Added value. Games outside.
Things for the guests to do.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.985
Well, I also think my stencil,
albeit $20,

22:42.069 --> 22:45.155
looks cleaner
and definitely ready for brides.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.241
This feels like...
a bit of furniture and we're done.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.370
Just put us in the country more often
and we get things done.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.621
Right.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.506
Straight back
to the center of the couch.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.842
We are putting in
the final touches on the vineyard cottage

23:06.843 --> 23:09.054
The interior has been completely updated,

23:09.137 --> 23:13.558
and we've created an outdoor living area
ideal for guests and weddings.

23:14.059 --> 23:20.023
These little extra touches, homemade
macaroons with brass writing and the logo,

23:20.107 --> 23:22.150
are the chocolate on the pillow.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.368
Lots of energy, everybody.
Let's do a cheers, yeah?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.245
Perfect right there!

23:34.121 --> 23:35.831
Because this property's so unique,

23:35.914 --> 23:39.000
we're actually adding
another layer of photos to the marketing.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.378
We brought in a lifestyle photographer

23:41.461 --> 23:45.799
to stage a wine tasting with models to
help sell an experience guests could have

23:45.882 --> 23:48.009
under the beautiful oak tree
on the property.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.054
So when they look at your photos
with the fabulous models,

23:51.138 --> 23:52.973
scrolling through like this,

23:53.056 --> 23:57.352
"That one's boring.
That one's boring. Oh, look at that one.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.647
Look at those lovely people.
That's where I want to stay."

24:00.730 --> 24:04.067
Cheers! Yay!

24:04.151 --> 24:05.652
Great. Awesome.

24:05.735 --> 24:06.862
So pretty.

24:06.945 --> 24:11.074
I am buying what you're selling.
I'd get married here. I'm taking you home.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.535
The cottage is done, fully transformed.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.662
It's time for the cottage photos.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.290
All right, Cris, so hey,
let's get some close-ups.

24:22.794 --> 24:27.591
As usual, we have my mate, Cris,
shooting beautiful photos at the cottage

24:27.674 --> 24:29.009
and all over the vineyard.

24:29.134 --> 24:33.472
I want to capture the romance of it.
I want to get the flowers, the incense,

24:33.555 --> 24:36.266
because this is such a storybook.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.602
-Yeah. This is great.
-Oh, yeah. Look at that.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.272
It's time to bring the Lockshaws back.
Are you ready?

24:42.355 --> 24:43.732
-One more picture?
-No.

24:45.358 --> 24:49.779
-Today, we wake up. Curtis says...
-Merry Christmas, honey.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.783
-Let's go see the cottage.
-We've waited all week for this.

24:53.867 --> 24:55.368
-Are you ready?
-Yes!

24:56.661 --> 25:00.081
Three, two, one.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.708
-Open.
-Open your eyes.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.085
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my God!

25:06.546 --> 25:08.715
Oh, God. This is just cool.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.801
-My God. Look at this!
-This is spectacular.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.596
-Oh, my God.
-This is just a... a...

25:14.721 --> 25:17.474
an... incredible environment right here.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.476
Oh, my gosh. It's really pretty.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.312
-Let's just remember what it was like.
-Don't wanna!

25:22.395 --> 25:24.439
-Not gonna do it.
-We have to!

25:24.523 --> 25:28.985
There was a muddy front yard
with a rotten old fence.

25:29.069 --> 25:34.908
And what we've turned it into
is this enormously natural welcome mat.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.409
Go take a look!

25:36.493 --> 25:38.745
-Oh, my God.
-Look at the trees.

25:38.828 --> 25:42.791
When you walk up to it,
you're drawn in there,

25:42.874 --> 25:44.709
Oh, my God.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.922
-Look at this deck.
-Oh, my God. This is just too nice.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.841
-And what do you see to your right, Sonja?
-Hmm.

25:55.637 --> 26:00.809
The farm sink on the deck is perfect.
It's a showstopper.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.938
This is from Revamped. Can you imagine
the wedding here? So romantic.

26:05.021 --> 26:05.855
It's amazing.

26:05.939 --> 26:11.319
Now the cottage's outdoor living space
can be used as the cocktail area.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.280
I can't wait for the first wedding.

26:13.363 --> 26:17.867
It's going to be
a super valuable addition to our weddings.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.998
Look at
our little sit-around warm-up area.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.420
-It's perfect.
-Your land.

26:29.087 --> 26:29.921
Wow.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.841
Having a fire feature or a water feature

26:32.924 --> 26:36.261
are items that both can really increase
your rate nightly.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.804
God, you guys are good!

26:38.305 --> 26:40.390
Squeeze together. Right?

26:41.725 --> 26:43.560
A little romantic moment.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.438
Let's just rent out the house,
and we'll live here.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.359
We got more to see.
Are you ready for next?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.569
-Yes.
-Okay.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.991
-Oh, my God.
-Holy Moses. Oh my God.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.287
This is unbelievable.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.836
I think the biggest issue in your cottage
before we got here

27:09.919 --> 27:11.921
was the space plan.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.090
The door opened right up into the bed.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.384
By moving the door to the kitchen,

27:16.468 --> 27:19.262
it feels like
we made the cottage bigger in some way.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.098
Gosh, I'm shocked. This is amazing.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.475
-It feels huge.
-Right?

27:23.558 --> 27:25.644
The kitchen. Oh, my gosh.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.729
There actually is a kitchen there now.

27:27.812 --> 27:32.692
We doubled the size of your kitchen.
Before we had one little unit over here.

27:32.776 --> 27:37.697
Now, there's a full galley of storage,
appliances, and shelving.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.408
This is unbelievable.

27:40.575 --> 27:43.578
Now it's too good
for our friends and family.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.163
So, talking about experiences,

27:45.246 --> 27:47.874
when your guests arrive
they decompress,

27:47.957 --> 27:50.126
they drink some wine you've left  them.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.587
Then they start planning
what they're gonna do.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.048
Remember the notice board
behind the door?

27:55.131 --> 27:59.052
Now you've got
wine tasting under the ancient oak...

27:59.427 --> 28:04.808
hike or bike trails,
learn to farm... with you!

28:05.225 --> 28:09.979
The new bulletin board is
a genius way of marketing experiences.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.649
Look at the bottom! Hashtag!

28:12.732 --> 28:15.151
My occupation by the way is blogger.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.114
Yes!

28:19.197 --> 28:21.199
-You ready for some bedroom?
-Yes.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.079
Oh, my gosh. Look how cute this is!

28:26.162 --> 28:29.708
Oh, my gosh.
It looks like a different place

28:32.627 --> 28:37.465
What we had here before
was the door that opened up into the bed.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.009
Now guests know
that they can get prepared here.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.637
We have the bridal hanger in the corner.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.098
-Look at that. You see that?
-For the dress.

28:45.181 --> 28:46.391
And a big mirror.

28:46.474 --> 28:50.729
-The biggest possible improvement.
-Probably is my favorite room.

28:50.812 --> 28:55.066
It's not just somewhere to stay.
It's kind of a rural resort

28:55.150 --> 28:59.404
that people will book
again and again and again.

28:59.487 --> 29:04.951
Vintage Ranch now
can offer an experience like no other.

29:05.368 --> 29:12.083
Everyone will walk away saying, "This
was the best place I've ever been to,"

29:12.167 --> 29:15.295
I've seen the lights go on
with the social media and marketing.

29:15.378 --> 29:18.965
You've got the design.
You now have the business tools

29:19.048 --> 29:21.259
that will enable you to thrive.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.596
You know blow away everyone else,

29:24.679 --> 29:27.223
and I believe that your bookings
will double.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.850
Hell yeah.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.603
You guys have changed our lives. You have.

29:31.728 --> 29:37.150
With Peter and Genevieve's help, we have
now brought up the value of our property

29:37.233 --> 29:39.778
to draw even more income in,

29:39.861 --> 29:45.784
which will launch us into
more than we could have ever hoped for.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.912
Something that we can be proud of now
to sell and market.

29:48.995 --> 29:52.832
It's just amazing. The whole thing.
It's frickin' amazing.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.671
Now we need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

29:58.755 --> 30:02.217
The Vintage Ranch of Paso Robles
is the epitome of a romantic getaway

30:02.300 --> 30:05.386
for weddings, wine tasting
and country living

30:05.470 --> 30:08.807
This farmhouse cottage offers
a landscaped outdoor living area

30:08.890 --> 30:11.392
and a fire pit with incredible views
of the farm.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.729
Inside the story continues
with a designer bedroom

30:14.813 --> 30:17.857
and a redesigned kitchen
fit for a several-day stay.

30:17.941 --> 30:21.319
Located in over 60 acres
of a fully-working vineyard,

30:21.402 --> 30:24.280
guests can explore the farm,
hike the private trails,

30:24.364 --> 30:29.452
and enjoy nature under the magnificent
250-year-old grand oak tree.

30:30.305 --> 30:36.340
