00:09.109 --> 00:12.340
<i>Doctors spend a lot of time</i>
<i>focused on the future.</i>

00:13.646 --> 00:15.113
<i>Planning it.</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:17.913
<i>Working toward it.</i>

00:23.623 --> 00:26.456
<i>But, at some point,</i>
<i>you start to realize</i>

00:26.493 --> 00:28.051
<i>your life is happening now.</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:31.689
- Any changes overnight?
- No.

00:31.765 --> 00:36.668
<i>Not after med school,</i>
<i>not after residency. Right now.</i>

00:36.770 --> 00:40.001
<i>This is it. It's here.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:43.373
<i>Blink, and you'll miss it.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:47.244
That's the chief.
Somebody better make a coffee run.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.213
You all look like hell.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.219
I gotta be in surgery
in ten minutes. Um...

00:53.253 --> 00:55.847
- Mer, will you let me know...
- Yeah.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.253
We should go too.
It's probably gonna be a while.

00:59.292 --> 01:03.752
Shepherd said she'd wake up.
What'd he tell you? Was that all crap?

01:03.830 --> 01:08.096
- What did he say?
- He said it may be a while.

01:13.973 --> 01:15.941
She's gonna wake up.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.533
Stevens still isn't awake
and I'm having something of a day,

01:43.570 --> 01:47.597
even aside from that,
so don't take my face personally.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.438
- It's just my face today.
- Did you tell her?

01:50.510 --> 01:54.241
Uh, you should tell her.
And don't take her face personally.

01:54.314 --> 01:58.512
OK. Well, on behalf of the
Department of Pediatric Surgery,

01:58.551 --> 02:01.452
welcome to the fellowship program.
You're in!

02:01.488 --> 02:04.514
- We're gonna get you wheelie sneaks!
- Congratulations.

02:09.062 --> 02:14.329
All right, I know I didn't
support you during this process.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.996
In any event, I am behind you now.

02:20.406 --> 02:24.740
I'm trying to be a big person here.
How about you meet me halfway?

02:30.150 --> 02:37.150
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.283
I have a headache.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.921
You're up.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.190
You're up and you're talking.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.530
You talked, right?

02:48.568 --> 02:50.934
- Talk!
- Ow...

02:50.970 --> 02:53.404
- I have a headache, stop yelling.
- Page Shepherd!

02:54.274 --> 02:55.764
- Ow.
- Sorry.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.878
Hey. What's with hugging O'Malley?

03:03.917 --> 03:09.116
I slept, Cristina. Last night.
I slept for the first time...

03:09.155 --> 03:13.421
- I slept.
- Hugging O'Malley because you slept?

03:13.459 --> 03:17.486
I hugged O'Malley because he's got great
news which I will let him tell you.

03:17.530 --> 03:22.661
But yeah, I guess, yeah,
maybe I hugged him because I slept.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.399
And that's because of you. You came with
me to see my mom, and then I slept.

03:26.439 --> 03:30.808
And I slept without nightmares.
That's not a small thing, Cristina.

03:30.843 --> 03:33.869
That... That is everything.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.372
I can be a better man.
I can be a better man for you.

03:37.450 --> 03:41.079
I hope, if you'll let me,

03:41.120 --> 03:43.179
I can be a better man with you.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.887
Don't say anything.
Just think about it. OK? OK.

03:55.501 --> 03:58.493
- Bailey? I need to tell you something.
- Not now, O'Malley.

03:58.538 --> 04:01.701
It'll be quick. I got to get to the OR
to scrub in with the chief.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.871
I think you're gonna be mad at first.
But I'm about to do something important,

04:05.912 --> 04:08.642
and I'm very sure about this decision.

04:09.315 --> 04:13.615
And I think eventually you're gonna be
proud but, you know, before that,

04:13.653 --> 04:16.281
you're probably gonna be like
"What did you do?"

04:16.322 --> 04:18.586
- I don't mean to imitate.
- You call that quick?

04:18.658 --> 04:21.684
I joined the Army to be a trauma
surgeon. I report for duty tomorrow.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.662
- You did what?!
- That's where I thought we'd start.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.169
- Something's going on with George.
- What?

04:31.571 --> 04:34.096
Owen hugged him. They were happy.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.565
We don't hug when we're happy.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.040
- Are you better?
- What?

04:40.079 --> 04:44.743
You know, with your therapy or whatever.
You said you got well.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.618
Well are you? Better?
Or are you just fake better?

04:48.688 --> 04:52.283
- What do you mean?
- I'm asking you if people...

04:52.358 --> 04:56.124
I mean, are you actually different?
Do you feel different?

04:56.195 --> 04:58.254
I'm getting married today.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.290
City Hall. No muss, no fuss.
Just quick and dirty.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.000
- Uh... Do you want me to come?
- No, no. Just letting you know.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.008
Wait. Uh... Uh...

05:09.042 --> 05:12.534
OK. This is my grocery list: it's old.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.445
Uh, this is new. Um...

05:15.548 --> 05:19.609
This is my favorite pen,
so I want it back. Borrowed.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.517
All of it's blue, so you're covered.

05:22.689 --> 05:25.749
Now see, if we were George and Owen,
we would hug right now.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.491
Dude!

05:35.568 --> 05:39.231
Unidentified male, dragged by a bus.
Clamped down so we couldn't intubate.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.604
- Didn't they stop?
- Bus driver didn't know

05:41.641 --> 05:45.133
- till they got halfway down the block.
- Is he gonna be OK?

05:46.713 --> 05:48.408
OK, I'll take over CPR.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.042
Push 20 of etomidate and 100 of sux.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.922
He saved my life. The bus was gonna
hit me, he threw me out of the way.

05:58.958 --> 06:02.155
- Grey, get her out of here.
- Was supposed to be me under the bus.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.993
He's alone.
They don't even know who he is. Please!

06:05.031 --> 06:06.828
Stand over there and just don't move.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.327
- He's back.
- Let's get a trauma series,

06:09.369 --> 06:13.328
trauma labs and O-neg blood in here.
Severe injury to the left forearm.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.371
- Skull's bashed in. Page Shepherd!
- And Sloan.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.282
Start antibiotics
and start cleaning out those wounds.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.378
Uh...

06:28.421 --> 06:30.946
Now can you get her out of here?

06:34.927 --> 06:36.918
Did you get the whole thing?

06:36.963 --> 06:40.262
- Did you get the whole tumor out?
- Just let me finish my exam.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.632
- Can you tell me your name?
- My name is Isobel Stevens,

06:43.669 --> 06:45.899
it's 2009

06:45.938 --> 06:50.272
and I'm in the Neuro ICU
at Seattle Grace Hospital.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.834
- Did you get the damn thing out?
- Got the whole damn thing.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.643
- You got it!
- Yeah.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.446
Oh, God, you got the whole thing.

06:59.485 --> 07:03.387
And I can talk and I know my name.
And I'm not a turnip!

07:03.456 --> 07:07.722
- Nope.
- No offense, you are a great surgeon,

07:07.794 --> 07:10.354
but I really thought
I was gonna be a turnip.

07:10.696 --> 07:15.929
- This is so unbelievably great!
- Your kidneys are a little sluggish,

07:15.968 --> 07:19.267
so we're gonna keep an eye on your
electrolytes for a few hours.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.934
- Your post-op crit was fine.
- OK, good.

07:23.509 --> 07:24.942
Good.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.117
How'd the surgery go?

07:32.151 --> 07:35.143
Did you get the brain tumor?
Did you get it out?

07:35.188 --> 07:38.214
Iz, you just asked him that.
We just talked about it.

07:38.257 --> 07:42.159
No, no. It's OK. She's gonna
be foggy for a while. The tumor's out.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.494
There was
a little bleeding during the post.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.499
- You got it?
- Yeah.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.091
All of it?

07:50.169 --> 07:52.000
That's amazing!

07:52.805 --> 07:56.263
Derek Shepherd, you are a hero!

07:56.342 --> 08:01.177
And I know that that's Derek Shepherd,
and you're Alex.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.310
And you should kiss me.

08:06.686 --> 08:10.144
Alex, I don't have a brain tumor.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.420
- I'm tumor free.
- Yes, you are.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.555
What's wrong?

08:20.199 --> 08:23.828
- Why do you look weird?
- Nothing. Nothing.

08:23.870 --> 08:26.464
Your kidneys are a little slow.
We're gonna watch them.

08:26.506 --> 08:31.967
OK, you'll re-check
my electrolytes in an hour. OK.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.611
How did the surgery go?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.214
Did you get the tumor?

08:42.455 --> 08:44.685
We did.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.282
Tumor's gone.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.158
There was a little bit of bleeding
and we took care of that.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.254
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.663
Oh, my God!

08:55.001 --> 08:57.697
And I can talk and you didn't kill me.

08:58.804 --> 09:01.967
What's wrong with you people?
We should be celebrating.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.705
She's like the woman who
couldn't remember her husband was dead.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.651
- We had to keep telling her.
- Could be a normal haze.

09:13.686 --> 09:18.350
Or the bleeding blitzed her short-term
retention. Did you screw up her brain?

09:18.658 --> 09:22.594
Karev... I'll be back.
Try and stay calm.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.220
Freaking her out is not gonna help.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.070
Wake up.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.797
Whoa.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.467
- Man versus bus.
- Bus won.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.669
Check out the left arm.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.207
- He's crashing again!
- What do we got?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.216
- Roadkill.
- You mind?

09:45.284 --> 09:48.117
Stepped in front of a bus to pull
a woman out of the way. Hero.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.520
- Can you can fix the arm?
- If it's gonna happen,

09:50.556 --> 09:53.081
- gotta be in the next few hours.
- Pupil's blown.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.117
Get me a cranial drill.
Grey, want to practice your burr holes?

09:57.363 --> 09:58.955
Stabilize his neck, please.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.634
Give me a ten-blade.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.798
Give me the drill.
Go in slowly. Feel a grab, stop.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.365
Otherwise, you'll hit brain.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.000
Let's go, quickly.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.512
- OK!
- That's it!

10:25.291 --> 10:26.690
Nice work, Dr. Grey.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.921
I'm gonna get some Bacitracin
for that face.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.088
- Let's get his head rotated.
- Easy.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.566
Welcome back, sir.
You had us worried there for a minute.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.901
- You think he's gonna make it?
- I hope so.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.811
He really has to make it.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.845
- Dr. Sloan.
- There's gonna be too much tension.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.681
Start over and do a layered closure.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.414
Um...

10:55.921 --> 10:58.788
Can I ask
a question about that?

11:04.597 --> 11:09.432
OK, you brought up moving in together
and marriage, and I put it off,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.970
now you're embarrassed
and won't make eye contact

11:12.004 --> 11:14.336
because you feel
I have all the power.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.865
But I don't want all the power.
I'm happy to share it.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.502
Can we just skip this part?

11:20.579 --> 11:24.413
Get some 4-0 Vicryl
so you can redo your patient's sutures.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.314
I'll totally pretend
I didn't hear any of that.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.726
Women do this to me. I don't do this.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.993
- "Let's get a house."
- Sucks being the girl.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.556
I'm not the girl.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.794
What do girls do?

11:45.604 --> 11:50.871
Well, we start with the cold shoulder,
so you're right on track.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.435
Then we go to our girlfriends
and we bitch.

11:53.479 --> 11:56.346
And our girlfriends say,
"You want to build a future,

11:56.382 --> 12:00.216
build it yourself. You don't need...

12:00.252 --> 12:05.155
...a man to give you that.
You want to buy a house? Buy a house."

12:06.992 --> 12:09.984
Huh. You're good at this.

12:10.029 --> 12:14.090
I ought to help someone get a love life.
I suck at my own.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.004
He jumped in front of a bus for me.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.265
- What did you do to O'Malley?
- Excuse me?

12:23.309 --> 12:26.506
Somebody else here likely to
convince someone to join the Army

12:26.545 --> 12:29.446
- and be a trauma surgeon in Iraq?
- What? Army?

12:29.482 --> 12:32.076
What?

12:32.118 --> 12:34.484
- V-fib!
- Charge the paddles to 360!

12:34.520 --> 12:37.318
- Call who you have to and undo this.
- Bailey, busy here.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.153
- Clear!
- George O'Malley?

12:39.191 --> 12:41.455
- It wasn't my idea!
- No change.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.724
- Charge again.
- Clear!

12:44.497 --> 12:49.127
I gave him a decent education in trauma.
I didn't know he was gonna go enlist.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.998
- He keeps coding.
- Open-book pelvic fracture.

12:53.038 --> 12:56.667
Too much bleeding. We take him
to an OR now, he'll die on the table.

12:56.709 --> 12:59.803
He needs to go to Angio
if we're gonna stop the bleeding.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.712
Sinus tach. We have a rhythm.
Barely there, but it's there.

13:02.748 --> 13:06.081
- Let's stabilize the pelvis.
- I know what goes on in this hospital.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.747
I know you're messed up from that war.
And not in a small way.

13:09.822 --> 13:10.880
Get him out of it.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.460
Page me if you need me.
I've got other patients.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.994
How'd you piss off all the women?

13:22.434 --> 13:25.562
- Let's get our guy to Angio.
- Angio? He's barely got a pulse!

13:25.604 --> 13:27.731
It's now or never,
if we want him to live. Move!

13:29.308 --> 13:34.473
I know it's tough, but I'd be grateful
if you'd stay alive for a few minutes.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.710
Maybe we're bouncier
in peds than general surgery,

13:41.754 --> 13:46.020
but I thought there would be a "Yay!"
or some jumping around.

13:46.759 --> 13:50.354
You look pretty dour for someone about
to start a highly prized fellowship.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.355
You are about to start
a highly prized fellowship, right?

13:54.967 --> 13:56.992
Hey, I've got a plan to stop George.
You in?

13:57.036 --> 14:00.733
- Stop George from what?
- He joined the Army. Yes, I'm in.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.906
Bailey! I'm talking to you...

14:05.211 --> 14:08.078
- Why are you trying to stop him?
- He joined the Army.

14:08.113 --> 14:11.742
- And?
- And because he's my ex-husband

14:11.784 --> 14:13.843
and I know his mom and I love his mom.

14:13.886 --> 14:17.583
And normally, Izzie would talk sense
into him, but she's got cancer

14:17.623 --> 14:20.922
and kind of a bad mental deficit,
so it's on me to stop him.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.258
- Why would you want to?
- He joined the Army.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.923
- Don't you think that's a problem?
- I think that's awesome.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.292
Awesome?

14:37.509 --> 14:40.569
- You gonna chew?
- My dragged under a bus guy's in Angio.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.605
They're gonna page me.
How's Izzie? Retaining anything?

14:43.649 --> 14:46.550
- No.
- OK.

14:46.585 --> 14:50.521
Uh, at 6pm, your idiotic colleague
George O'Malley

14:50.556 --> 14:52.490
will finish his surgery with the chief.

14:52.524 --> 14:56.119
At 6pm, you will be standing beside us
in the OR hallway prepared to join

14:56.161 --> 14:58.425
- in an intervention.
- What polite company call

14:58.464 --> 15:01.297
an intervention,
though I'm not sure interventions

15:01.333 --> 15:03.267
involve whupping people on the behinds

15:03.302 --> 15:05.930
- with a belt.
- What? He's got a drinking problem now?

15:05.971 --> 15:07.336
- He joined the Army.
- What?

15:07.373 --> 15:10.308
Double O Seven? He can't go,
he's the guy that gets killed.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.003
Gets killed cleaning his own gun.

15:12.044 --> 15:15.070
Grey is going to coax him back
as a loving friend,

15:15.114 --> 15:19.608
you're gonna use logic and reason
to point out the idiocy of his ways,

15:19.652 --> 15:23.782
Stevens will make sad cancer eyes,
and if all of that doesn't work,

15:23.822 --> 15:28.088
Karev, you pull out your "I was raised
out back with the trash cans" roots

15:28.127 --> 15:30.960
- and just beat the crap out of him.
- Six o'clock.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.293
Six o'clock.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.700
Hey, there.

15:41.874 --> 15:46.004
I know this must be scary. If it's any
consolation, you're a hardcore hero.

15:46.045 --> 15:48.036
You saved that woman's life.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.855
Is he trying to write something?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.323
Can you hold this?

16:14.373 --> 16:17.706
OK. You'll be stronger tomorrow.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.473
Call OR 1,
tell them to get ready for him.

16:20.512 --> 16:21.638
OK.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.215
Amanda, you can't be out here.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.414
Would you want to be all alone
at a time like this?

16:31.890 --> 16:35.758
We had 30 seconds of interaction
before he saved my life,

16:35.794 --> 16:39.252
and I wasn't even nice.

16:40.165 --> 16:44.329
I was standing on a corner when this

16:44.370 --> 16:47.669
ordinary-looking guy
stands next to me and smiles.

16:47.706 --> 16:52.769
And... And I'm so busy
scoping for someone hotter,

16:52.811 --> 16:58.010
that...
I don't even give him a second look.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.118
Next thing I know,
he throws me out of the way of a bus

17:01.153 --> 17:05.055
I'm about to walk in front of
and almost gets himself killed.

17:05.089 --> 17:09.550
He literally...
he swept me off my feet.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.925
That is my prince in that bed.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.063
OK. You can stay
until they take him to surgery.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.541
Not a good time.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.747
Walk away from me again, I will
grab you by the hair and pull hard.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.723
I grew up with the name Arizona.
I learned how to play dirty.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.782
I stuck my neck out for you.
You were my pick.

17:40.826 --> 17:43.761
And I appreciate that.
But it's a big decision.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.664
It's not, it's the brass ring. It's the
most exclusive, most competitive

17:47.699 --> 17:50.896
and we're as good as it gets.
Nobody lands this thing and says "no."

17:50.936 --> 17:56.101
My husband informed me yesterday
that if I accept the peds fellowship,

17:56.141 --> 17:59.372
if I sign on
for another two years of training

17:59.411 --> 18:01.709
and the hours
and workload that come with it,

18:01.747 --> 18:06.514
when I could be a general surgery
attending and make it home for dinner,

18:06.552 --> 18:08.144
he will divorce me.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.756
It's a big decision.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.538
Gonna have a hard time saving that arm.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.270
I can get him back to full function
if I can get there in time.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.306
- Thinking about buying a house.
- Good.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.509
Meredith and I are gonna
go to City Hall this afternoon.

18:38.550 --> 18:42.452
- Getting married.
- Really? That's great news.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.753
- If I could just save Stevens...
- You're allowed to be happy.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.090
You're allowed to get married.
You've earned that right.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.564
Congratulations, you lucky bastard.
Come here, give me a hug.

18:54.566 --> 18:58.229
- Why is everyone hugging today?
- The blushing bride.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.261
Here's the plan for our John Doe.

19:00.305 --> 19:03.900
Shepherd, evacuate the epidural,
Grey and I correct internal injuries.

19:03.942 --> 19:06.467
Torres will place the internal fixator.

19:06.545 --> 19:10.948
Sloan should work on the arm
if the patient doesn't get too acidotic.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.646
- You think he has a shot?
- I've seen people come back from worse.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.526
- Hey. I thought you were in surgery.
- I'm on my way.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.552
You talked to Bailey
about peds and Tucker?

19:24.596 --> 19:27.360
No. I talked to Bailey
about the Army thing and George.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.358
Are you upset with me?

19:31.403 --> 19:33.098
No. I'm awesome.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.470
- Calliope...
- No. Do not "Calliope" me.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.377
You said it was awesome.
George, sweet, kind George,

19:41.413 --> 19:45.042
who can't even kill a fly
is joining the Army to go to Iraq

19:45.083 --> 19:47.176
- and you said awesome.
- It is. Awesome.

19:47.219 --> 19:50.677
No, it is not awesome! God!
Who are you?

19:53.859 --> 19:55.690
- How's the arm?
- Nerves are intact,

19:55.727 --> 19:59.663
- just have to reattach these vessels.
- You ready for me?

19:59.698 --> 20:02.758
I'm almost done
with the major internal crush injuries.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.361
Pelvis will be all yours.
Get me some more laps.

20:05.437 --> 20:08.998
You think you could do it? Step in front
of a bus for a perfect stranger?

20:09.041 --> 20:12.477
- We'd all like to think we would...
- More or less what Hunt's been doing

20:12.511 --> 20:15.207
- every day for the last couple years.
- No. The guys did.

20:15.247 --> 20:19.343
I just came in behind them
with a dustpan and broom and swept up.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.785
You sewed up soldiers under fire.
You didn't sweep up.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.917
How do you think O'Malley's gonna do
over there? Think he can handle it?

20:30.495 --> 20:33.191
- No, I don't.
- I think he's gonna surprise us all.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.895
- He's coming back in a body bag.
- I think you all should just shut up.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.266
Just shut the hell up.

20:40.839 --> 20:43.000
Please, shut up.

20:47.779 --> 20:53.046
"Shepherd got your whole tumor out."
Oh, my God!

20:53.085 --> 20:55.747
Alex, why didn't you tell me?
Oh, my God!

20:57.022 --> 20:58.046
Oh.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.991
We're working on it. Remember
what time you woke up this morning?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.288
Um...

21:02.327 --> 21:04.852
- Not exactly.
- 7:45.

21:04.896 --> 21:09.959
- 7:45. "O'Malley joined the Army?"
- Gonna be a trauma surgeon in Iraq.

21:10.035 --> 21:13.732
- When'd you wake up?
- 7:45. He's gonna get killed.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.731
- We're dealing with it.
- Did you know about this George thing?

21:17.776 --> 21:21.234
Yup. Cannon fodder.
I'm just gonna take some more blood.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.943
Last time we checked, your potassium
was 6.3. When'd you wake up?

21:24.983 --> 21:30.285
- Um, early, I can't quite remember.
- 7:45. 6.3, 7:45.

21:33.458 --> 21:37.326
- "O'Malley joined the Army?" George?
- We're dealing with it.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.728
- What's your potassium?
- I...

21:39.765 --> 21:43.462
- Iz, what's your potassium?
- Give her the chart to read

21:43.502 --> 21:47.939
and try and memorize, OK? I can
talk to you about her hyperkalemia.

21:55.681 --> 21:59.173
She had brain surgery, and an
incredibly aggressive course of IL-2.

21:59.217 --> 22:02.152
- She needs rest.
- She needs to exercise memory

22:02.187 --> 22:06.055
- before it all turns to mush.
- Not with you barking orders at her.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.821
- Butt out.
- I don't care if you're her husband.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.124
Want to see how fast I can get
your visiting hours down to zero?

22:11.163 --> 22:13.996
She signed a DNR.
She signed a friggin' DNR

22:14.032 --> 22:17.627
and made me promise she'd come out of
this with a life. Not in a hospital bed.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.365
Not with no brain.
I had to promise she'd have a life.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.340
You want to know what happens
if she can't make new memories?

22:23.375 --> 22:26.867
Forget about being a doctor.
She'll need round the clock babysitters.

22:26.912 --> 22:29.813
We get an apartment,
she can't find her way to the toilet!

22:29.848 --> 22:32.976
Tracker on her ankle in case
she wanders out the front door!

22:33.018 --> 22:36.784
Alex. You can handle this.
She will get better.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.313
Maybe, maybe not.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.225
It's on me. Her future is on me.

22:50.602 --> 22:53.594
- Is he gonna be OK?
- We'll know more in the morning.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.937
Go ahead.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.386
How's she doing? Any better?

23:20.966 --> 23:23.833
- No.
- Damn.

23:25.103 --> 23:28.470
Well, I'm going to City Hall

23:28.507 --> 23:31.067
- to go do the thing.
- Seriously?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.942
It doesn't seem like the day for it.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.517
Look at Alex.
He's in there working so hard all day.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.748
And she doesn't know.
And if she stays like this,

23:42.788 --> 23:46.383
she may never know how much
he loves her. And that girl Amanda?

23:46.425 --> 23:51.692
She's in there loving a stranger.
She thinks that's her Prince Charming.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.563
He's probably gonna die today.
Chances are.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.892
So, yeah, I'm gonna go get married.
Because I think it's important

23:58.937 --> 24:02.600
to take the time to tell the people
you love how much you love them

24:02.641 --> 24:04.609
while they can hear you.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.951
I love you, Cristina Yang.

24:24.196 --> 24:28.064
- You have changed.
- Maybe I have.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.299
- What?
- I'm gonna hug you.

24:48.286 --> 24:50.948
Maybe I don't understand people.
I don't see things.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.981
Maybe I just don't get what's
going on with you or why you're mad,

24:54.025 --> 24:57.825
but I think it's awesome.
George joining the Army is awesome.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.525
- Shut up!
- Um, no.

25:00.565 --> 25:03.591
You asked me who I was.
I am a person who thinks

25:03.635 --> 25:07.298
that what George is doing
is dangerous and terrifying and brave.

25:07.372 --> 25:10.864
He's going to serve his country.
He's going to risk his life to save

25:10.909 --> 25:15.437
the men and women who make it possible
for you and I to sleep in our beds.

25:15.947 --> 25:18.609
I am a person who thinks that
that is brave.

25:19.084 --> 25:22.315
And I am a person
who stood in an airplane hangar

25:22.354 --> 25:26.518
and watched them unload
my brother's body in a coffin,

25:26.558 --> 25:28.788
and all we got was a flag.

25:31.396 --> 25:34.923
My brother died over there because
there weren't enough doctors.

25:34.966 --> 25:38.493
So for my money, George O'Malley
is a patriot. He's a hero.

25:38.537 --> 25:44.203
And I am grateful that he exists.
So, yeah, the word I use is "awesome."

25:44.409 --> 25:46.001
That's who I am.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.846
I'm sorry.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.659
- I'm sorry...
- Wait!

26:19.844 --> 26:23.712
I love... you.

26:27.485 --> 26:29.282
- I... I love you too.
- No.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.345
Just...

26:33.425 --> 26:35.290
I love you.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.192
I said I love you!

26:41.232 --> 26:42.722
Me.

26:45.403 --> 26:46.734
Cristina Yang!

26:52.644 --> 26:56.171
- You traumatized me.
- I didn't know... I'm so sorry.

26:56.214 --> 27:00.742
No, damn it, not about the choking.
You come here and you pull out my icicle

27:00.819 --> 27:03.151
and you make me love you and I can't...

27:03.221 --> 27:07.749
I don't want to...
I can't breathe...

27:09.127 --> 27:11.061
...without you.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.699
You can do this, Cristina.
We can do this.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.899
All you have to do is meet me halfway.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.032
All you have to do is say "yes."

27:28.413 --> 27:30.404
All you have to do is say "yes."

27:34.319 --> 27:37.720
- What's your crit?
- Ugh.

27:38.289 --> 27:42.453
This is disgusting. I can't believe
we serve it to the patients.

27:43.695 --> 27:47.096
"You keep asking for lime Jell-O
and don't like it."

27:47.565 --> 27:49.226
So stop giving it to me.

27:49.267 --> 27:50.666
You get mad if I don't.

27:50.735 --> 27:54.933
- OK. Now what's your crit?
- I don't know.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.737
- I'm tired.
- What's O'Malley doing tomorrow?

27:57.776 --> 27:59.801
Joining the Army.

27:59.844 --> 28:03.575
- I need a break.
- You don't think I need a break?

28:03.615 --> 28:06.914
- Suck it up.
- God!

28:07.485 --> 28:11.979
Back off.
I'm sorry if this is hard for you,

28:12.023 --> 28:16.153
but you are not the one
with the short-term memory of a carrot.

28:20.832 --> 28:25.701
Hey, go ahead, get it off your chest.
It's not like I'm gonna remember.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.797
I'm not the one with the carrot brain,
but I'm married to it.

28:29.140 --> 28:34.100
Some wedding we walked into, because
we thought you'd be dead in a week.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.511
You made me promise
you wouldn't live like this.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.574
What am I supposed to do?
Smother you with a pillow?

28:39.617 --> 28:43.747
Shoot you up with an overdose of
morphine? Not really psyched about that.

28:43.788 --> 28:47.485
Leave you? Not psyched about that,
either. So I'm kind of screwed, right?

28:47.525 --> 28:50.926
Not as bad as you, but not
a friggin' walk in the park either!

28:58.236 --> 28:59.897
I'm sorry, Iz.

29:00.371 --> 29:05.331
No, I told you
to get it off your chest. You did.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.947
Did you forget yet?

29:14.819 --> 29:16.514
Nope.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.545
Not yet, give me a minute.

29:29.634 --> 29:31.295
Um...

29:31.336 --> 29:36.501
If there's still a spot for me
in general surgery, I'd like to take it.

29:36.541 --> 29:40.341
I spent months trying to talk you
off peds, I finally get on board,

29:40.378 --> 29:44.280
- and you change your mind?
- Tucker gave me an ultimatum.

29:44.315 --> 29:47.113
The fellowship or our marriage.

29:50.588 --> 29:53.921
- You chose your marriage.
- No, I'm leaving him.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.951
Because a marriage that resorts
to ultimatums is not a marriage.

29:57.996 --> 30:01.295
I mean what kind of husband does that?

30:01.332 --> 30:06.668
So I'm going to be a single mom.

30:06.704 --> 30:10.970
It's not the time for new specialties.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.606
Damn!

30:16.648 --> 30:20.277
I'm sorry. It's just
the first time I've said it out loud.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.684
It kind of took the wind out of me.

30:24.255 --> 30:29.488
Miranda, are you sure about this?
He might come around.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.828
- He's just scared.
- We're all scared!

30:33.865 --> 30:37.028
If you're not scared,
you're not paying attention!

30:37.068 --> 30:41.801
One of my residents just signed up
to go to war! That's scary!

30:41.873 --> 30:45.138
Another one
almost lost her life to melanoma,

30:45.176 --> 30:47.371
and doesn't know what day it is!
That's scary!

30:47.412 --> 30:50.472
What Tucker's facing isn't scary!

30:50.515 --> 30:53.382
He's just weak!

30:59.958 --> 31:03.223
A pat on the back isn't gonna help, sir.

31:04.629 --> 31:06.460
Should I go?

31:10.134 --> 31:11.795
OK.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.500
OK.

31:17.575 --> 31:21.875
I'll just stand here with you,
if that's all right.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.314
Yes, sir. That would be fine.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.756
I thought you were operating
on John Doe.

31:39.797 --> 31:44.666
I already did. I'm looking at houses.
One has a stone fireplace which I like.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.569
This one has a backyard
the size of Montana.

31:47.605 --> 31:52.201
- Uh-huh. You're buying a house?
- Yeah.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.871
Right. OK.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.274
I'm buying a house. Right now. It's a
buyers' market and I'm buying a house.

31:59.350 --> 32:02.751
The only reason you're even talking
about a house is to make me feel bad.

32:03.288 --> 32:07.725
You're trying to prove you're moving on
without me so I'll change my mind.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.091
This what women are doing
when they say they're moving on?

32:10.128 --> 32:12.824
Yeah. They don't usually
take out a home loan to do it.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.197
Pathetic. Let me be clear.
I'm moving on.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.928
I'm a better woman than you.

32:24.742 --> 32:26.801
- Ready to go?
- I just got a page.

32:26.844 --> 32:28.869
Our John Doe needs
to go back into surgery.

32:28.913 --> 32:33.509
Post-op CT showed a re-bleed.
I'm gonna have Nelson take care of it.

32:33.551 --> 32:36.076
- No. Really?
- I'd prefer to do it myself,

32:36.120 --> 32:40.352
but I wanna check in on Izzie. We can
do that first then get married after?

32:40.391 --> 32:44.259
- We have the George intervention after.
- I'll have Nelson do it.

32:44.329 --> 32:46.320
Tell them to prep.
We'll run to City Hall,

32:46.364 --> 32:48.855
- we'll come back and we'll do it.
- Meredith.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.733
No. Let's go.
We gotta go. We gotta run to City Hall,

32:51.769 --> 32:54.363
come back, check on Izzie,
we'll monitor John Doe,

32:54.405 --> 32:57.636
- talk George out of the Army...
- We could do this another day.

32:57.675 --> 33:01.042
There is no other day!
Every day is like this.

33:01.079 --> 33:04.105
Every day there's a crisis.
There's no time.

33:04.148 --> 33:08.084
- Meredith...
- I love you. I wanna marry you today.

33:08.119 --> 33:10.587
But there is no time.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.863
- You have a piece of paper?
- For what?

33:19.897 --> 33:23.958
I wanna be with you forever,
and you wanna be with me forever.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.631
And in order to do that,
we need to make vows,

33:27.705 --> 33:31.072
a commitment, a contract.

33:31.109 --> 33:36.342
- Give me a piece of paper.
- I don't... I don't.

33:36.948 --> 33:39.348
I have Post-its.

33:40.818 --> 33:41.842
OK.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.319
What do we want to promise each other?

33:57.535 --> 34:01.130
That you'll love me
even when you hate me.

34:02.373 --> 34:06.332
To love each other
even when we hate each other.

34:08.312 --> 34:13.579
No running, ever. Nobody walks out.
No matter what happens.

34:14.752 --> 34:16.777
- No running.
- What else?

34:17.855 --> 34:22.155
That we'll take care of each other even
when we're old and smelly and senile.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.788
If I get Alzheimer's and forget you...

34:26.831 --> 34:30.391
I will remind you who I am every day.

34:31.436 --> 34:35.735
To take care when old, senile, smelly.

34:36.306 --> 34:40.572
This... is forever.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.375
Sign.

34:47.552 --> 34:50.112
- This is our wedding? A Post-it?
- Mm-hm.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.011
Well, if you sign it.

35:04.569 --> 35:05.934
Now what?

35:05.970 --> 35:07.938
Now I kiss the bride.

35:19.617 --> 35:22.484
- Married?
- Married.

35:27.258 --> 35:28.748
See that?

35:31.028 --> 35:32.552
Plenty of time.

35:38.803 --> 35:42.330
- Gotta do an EKG.
- I don't even get any small talk?

35:44.075 --> 35:46.100
- What's your problem?
- I'll tell you.

35:46.544 --> 35:49.877
I know I'm supposed to be grateful
for my new lease on life.

35:49.914 --> 35:54.908
But Alex marched in here and basically
told me that being married to me

35:54.952 --> 35:58.752
was the worst thing
that ever happened to him. Yeah.

35:58.789 --> 36:02.156
And that he was trying to decide
if smothering me with a pillow

36:02.193 --> 36:05.685
was the best way
to put us both out of our misery.

36:11.869 --> 36:14.963
- OK, where is it?
- Where's what?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.768
Where's the note that says that?

36:16.807 --> 36:19.139
- Did you write that down?
- No.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.904
No!

36:30.188 --> 36:31.212
I'll be right there.

36:40.765 --> 36:41.789
Yes.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.200
Yes!

36:45.570 --> 36:48.698
- I've gotta go. I've gotta find Alex.
- Go.

36:54.879 --> 36:58.508
Oh. Sorry. I was looking for George.
It's after six.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.074
Uh, we scheduled an intervention

37:01.118 --> 37:05.248
so we could give O'Malley a piece of our
minds about this idiotic Army business.

37:05.289 --> 37:08.053
- Did he leave already?
- He never scrubbed in.

37:09.026 --> 37:12.086
He told me he was enlisting,
I sent him home to spend the day

37:12.129 --> 37:16.463
with his mom since he's leaving so soon.
He took off this morning.

37:23.040 --> 37:25.838
- How's his ICP?
- Worse. OR's expecting us.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.868
- I thought you were getting married.
- We did.

37:28.913 --> 37:31.473
Sure you want
to start your honeymoon in an OR?

37:31.515 --> 37:33.176
We're sure.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.715
You can't be in here.
I'll come get you in the waiting room.

37:38.756 --> 37:42.817
Hold his hand until you put him under.
It does make him feel better.

37:42.860 --> 37:43.884
OK.

37:52.069 --> 37:54.503
Well,
you made a good friend there.

37:54.538 --> 37:56.904
That happens
when you take a bus for somebody.

37:58.442 --> 38:04.244
OK. I know this is scary.
But you do have a great team up there.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.074
You wanna try to write again?

38:10.254 --> 38:13.280
Can you hold the pen? No?

38:13.357 --> 38:15.416
OK. O?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.427
O.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.431
Seven?

38:28.673 --> 38:32.302
Double O... Seven.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.052
Oh, God! Oh, God!

38:47.224 --> 38:49.488
- You paged. What do you need?
- Way to go dipwad.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.620
Telling your wife
you're trying to off her?

38:51.662 --> 38:54.688
Mind your business... Wait.

38:54.732 --> 38:57.530
- How did you know that?
- She told me.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.269
You remember?

39:02.406 --> 39:05.000
Pillow or morphine.
I got the whole thing.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.374
- I didn't mean that.
- Of course you didn't.

39:07.411 --> 39:10.903
You love me too much to shoot me up
with morphine even if I asked you to.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.514
And my stupid gorked brain
is coming back.

39:14.552 --> 39:17.077
Oh, my God, I was so scared.

39:17.121 --> 39:20.022
I mean, I would have
loved you no matter what.

39:20.725 --> 39:23.785
You're back. You're back.

39:24.428 --> 39:27.488
Iz. Iz?

39:28.032 --> 39:29.294
Izzie!

39:29.667 --> 39:32.795
- Yang!
- It's George! It's George!

39:34.105 --> 39:36.835
It's George! John Doe is George!

39:39.477 --> 39:43.174
- Izzie, look at me! Open your eyes!
- Page Shepherd, the chief, Bailey.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.910
We have you, you hear me?
We have you, we'll fix this.

39:45.950 --> 39:48.976
- Just stay with us.
- O'Malley, it's Shepherd.

39:49.019 --> 39:51.249
- You're not going anywhere.
- BP's dropping.

39:51.288 --> 39:53.552
Put him out now!

39:54.558 --> 39:56.185
- What happened?
- Is it her brain?

39:56.227 --> 39:58.388
- Hyperkalemia.
- Couldn't control the arrhythmias.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.896
- Pressure's dropping.
- Intubation tray.

40:00.965 --> 40:05.129
- Alex, she signed a DNR.
- Shut up!

40:05.169 --> 40:08.070
- She knew this might happen.
- I don't give a crap!

40:08.105 --> 40:09.402
It's not what she wants.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.070
Get a crash cart!

40:14.145 --> 40:17.512
- Karev, if she didn't...
- Look at her! Get a crash cart!

40:25.122 --> 40:29.422
- Screw the DNR! Hand me those paddles!
- Yang, take over compressions.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.960
- I got it.
- One, two, three.

40:32.062 --> 40:33.188
And down.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.259
Charge to 300.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.496
<i>Did you say it?</i>

40:42.773 --> 40:44.365
<i>I love you?</i>

40:44.842 --> 40:45.900
Clear.

40:48.379 --> 40:51.507
<i>I don't ever want</i>
<i>to live without you?</i>

40:52.183 --> 40:54.242
<i>You changed my life.</i>

40:54.285 --> 40:55.946
<i>Did you say it?</i>

40:58.155 --> 40:59.782
<i>Make a plan.</i>

41:01.525 --> 41:04.688
<i>Set a goal, work toward it.</i>

41:05.129 --> 41:08.963
<i>But every now and then, look around.</i>

41:09.400 --> 41:10.424
Come on.

41:11.235 --> 41:12.964
<i>Drink it in.</i>

41:41.365 --> 41:43.629
<i>'Cause this is it.</i>

41:48.038 --> 41:49.596
We're losing him!

42:05.122 --> 42:07.181
Come on, Stevens.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.055
Come on.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.930
V-fib! Clear!

42:15.466 --> 42:17.593
<i>It might</i>
<i>all be gone tomorrow.</i>
