00:02.423 --> 00:05.000
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.000 --> 00:08.103
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.103 --> 00:09.975
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.975 --> 00:11.868
These are their stories.

00:13.907 --> 00:17.688
- I thought you wanted me to come.
- Christian, you know when your time is.

00:17.688 --> 00:19.804
Aren't you happy to see me?

00:19.804 --> 00:22.460
You can call me... later.

00:39.026 --> 00:40.820
I have five more minutes, man.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.191
This is bull.

00:42.191 --> 00:44.968
- You owe us the time.
- Five minutes!

00:54.115 --> 00:57.073
That's how happy
your message made me.

00:57.073 --> 00:59.310
Thanks for the second chance.

01:02.265 --> 01:05.633
Happy Birthday.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.327
Dr. Barnes's table is this way.

01:07.327 --> 01:10.254
- I'm expecting a limo at 10:00.
- Sure.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.563
There's a mistake. / No problem.
We'll add a place setting.

01:16.563 --> 01:18.118
No, I have to get out of...

01:18.118 --> 01:20.234
This is completely inappropriate.

01:20.234 --> 01:21.446
Eloise, l-I didn't...

01:21.446 --> 01:24.967
Honey, go back to the table.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.720
Why don't we talk, hmm?

01:33.274 --> 01:34.990
Time for your shift at Kinko's?

01:34.990 --> 01:36.926
Keep moving, Kenny G.

01:39.596 --> 01:41.492
What the hell is your problem, man?

01:54.566 --> 01:57.366
Is this to punish me, hmm?

01:57.366 --> 01:59.241
It's you who hurt me.

02:00.677 --> 02:03.815
I want you to call me 
tomorrow morning.

02:04.647 --> 02:07.797
It's time we changed 
our relationship.

02:16.952 --> 02:20.002
Camilla? Graham?

02:26.871 --> 02:30.997
Oh, my God.

02:32.933 --> 02:35.111
My desk!

02:37.209 --> 02:39.104
Camilla, call 911.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.292
No!

02:40.292 --> 02:42.321
No. It's... 
It's all right.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.337
I'll clean it up myself.

02:49.618 --> 02:51.654
Still drunk from last night?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.685
Oh, man, what happened to his face?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2004/03/07

03:51.353 --> 03:54.330
The room was booked 6:00 to 8:00 
by Mr. Lyle, a student at Juilliard.

03:54.330 --> 03:55.206
Who found him?

03:55.206 --> 03:57.682
The 8:00 to 10:00 booking.
We got 'em in the room next door.

03:57.682 --> 03:59.912
They're waiting on their lawyer 
before they talk to us.

03:59.912 --> 04:01.324
Witnesses need lawyers now?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.775
Just the ones with trust funds.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.349
Murder weapon's over here.

04:05.985 --> 04:07.819
Acid burns.

04:10.379 --> 04:13.259
The killer got close to him.
He might've known him.

04:16.803 --> 04:20.442
Eight-inch kitchen knife.
Looks fresh out of the package.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.594
Well, the killer...

04:24.324 --> 04:26.921
came in low,

04:26.921 --> 04:31.407
Christian was probably flailing 
his arms around... after he was

04:31.407 --> 04:33.442
blinded by the acid.

04:35.962 --> 04:37.858
Stitches.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.832
Black eye.

04:49.149 --> 04:52.540
Well, this could be the trump 
in a long running feud.

04:52.540 --> 04:54.817
Maybe a battle of the bands.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.704
My clients are witnesses.

04:57.704 --> 05:00.452
They all have alibis 
for the time of the murder.

05:00.452 --> 05:04.645
That's impressive. We haven't 
established the time of death yet.

05:05.718 --> 05:08.920
How'd you tear your knuckles up?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.317
Doing windmills on your guitar?

05:11.317 --> 05:13.875
Or on the trumpet player's face?

05:13.987 --> 05:15.659
The dude started it.

05:15.659 --> 05:19.278
Last Thursday, we're, um,
we're loading out our gear,

05:19.278 --> 05:23.221
he walks up, kicks my guitar,
then he throws a punch at us.

05:23.221 --> 05:25.538
After the first punch, 
what'd he do?

05:25.538 --> 05:26.814
Nothing.

05:26.814 --> 05:29.242
Didn't even protect himself.
He's lucky we didn't bust his lip.

05:29.242 --> 05:30.834
All right, that's enough.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.626
You need them, 
you talk to me first.

05:32.626 --> 05:33.782
Come on, guys.

05:38.279 --> 05:42.383
St. Vincent's is the nearest E.R.
He probably got his stitches there.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.774
Maybe it wasn't the only 
treatment he was getting.

05:45.925 --> 05:49.654
You know, I need 
to see his C.D.'s again.

05:50.987 --> 05:54.337
I remember some of his home 
recordings had interesting titles.

05:54.337 --> 05:57.712
"Self-actualization." 
Here.

05:59.188 --> 06:01.545
"Transference Bebop"?

06:01.837 --> 06:03.786
These are ...

06:03.786 --> 06:06.827
psychotherapeutic terms.

06:07.457 --> 06:11.361
- He was seeing a shrink.
- Been better off seeing a lyricist.

06:12.045 --> 06:14.348
home Of Dr. Eloise Barnes 
120 West 85th Street
Wednesday, February 11

06:14.348 --> 06:18.272
This is such a shock.
He has no other family.

06:18.272 --> 06:20.875
His mother passed away 
in childbirth.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.305
Well, that explains it.

06:22.305 --> 06:24.942
Starting all the fights,
not defending himself.

06:24.942 --> 06:27.261
Felt guilty about his mother.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.117
That's very good, Detective.

06:29.231 --> 06:33.483
St. Vincent's told us he was treated 
four times last year for fight injuries.

06:33.483 --> 06:35.457
Anybody have it in for him?

06:35.457 --> 06:38.127
He was only my patient 
for four months.

06:38.127 --> 06:41.099
The hospital said that 
he called you Thursday.

06:41.099 --> 06:44.308
You went downtown in the middle 
of the night to see him.

06:44.308 --> 06:47.748
You thought that he was,
um, suicidal?

06:48.160 --> 06:54.574
No, but I thought it was an opportune 
time to confront his behavior.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.030
Did you spill something here?

06:59.342 --> 07:05.977
Because there's a circle of clean rug,
and you have no blotter.

07:07.554 --> 07:12.782
I have an old cat,
and he has accidents.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.543
Your cat...

07:19.152 --> 07:21.440
He jimmy locks too?

07:21.440 --> 07:24.099
Because that's been fixed.

07:24.099 --> 07:25.815
Someone broke in here.

07:25.815 --> 07:27.650
One of your patients?

07:27.650 --> 07:29.626
I have no idea.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.733
It happened last Sunday.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.703
We were seeing friends 
off to the airport.

07:34.703 --> 07:37.151
Christian, um...

07:37.151 --> 07:39.778
Did you know 
he recorded a new piece?

07:39.778 --> 07:41.774
"Transference Bebop."

07:42.787 --> 07:45.245
Transference... 
It means...

07:45.245 --> 07:49.739
when a patient directs 
his feelings for his mother,

07:49.739 --> 07:52.307
for example, 
to his therapist.

07:52.307 --> 07:54.022
That's correct.

07:54.022 --> 07:56.690
And while Christian 
revered his mother for...

07:56.690 --> 08:00.670
sacrificing herself to save his life,

08:00.670 --> 08:04.963
he might've also resented her 
for making him feel guilty.

08:04.963 --> 08:06.617
You're impressing me.

08:06.617 --> 08:10.262
So... if he was transferring 
his feelings to you,

08:10.262 --> 08:15.926
then he might've resented you 
to the point of breaking in, and,

08:15.926 --> 08:19.963
you know,
urinating on your desk.

08:19.963 --> 08:24.393
That's assuming he revered me
in the first place.

08:25.185 --> 08:27.562
I'm a psychiatrist.

08:27.562 --> 08:32.340
Unlike some people, I have no trouble 
making my boundaries clear.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.429
"Some people." 
You mean police officers?

08:35.429 --> 08:39.134
No. Social workers, psychologists.

08:39.134 --> 08:40.969
Oh, and for the record,

08:40.969 --> 08:44.310
Christian was masochistic,

08:44.310 --> 08:46.588
not contemptuous.

08:46.588 --> 08:49.065
Now,

08:49.065 --> 08:51.221
I've got a room full of patients.

08:54.014 --> 08:56.795
Dr. Barnes is what, 47?
She's old enough to be his mother.

08:56.795 --> 08:59.635
I guess that's the point.
Miniskirts can work wonders.

08:59.635 --> 09:02.166
Well, she might've started dressing 
that way after the fact.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.124
An affair can make you feel sexy.

09:05.124 --> 09:07.992
Lab says the weapon of 
choice was sulfuric acid.

09:07.992 --> 09:09.827
Available at any drugstore.

09:09.827 --> 09:11.643
Or in any car battery.

09:12.154 --> 09:13.868
What are you listening to?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.193
It's called "In Celebration." 
Christian recorded it Thursday.

09:18.193 --> 09:20.672
The day he ended up in the E.R.

09:21.886 --> 09:25.158
Could you look up 
Eloise's driver's license?

09:25.158 --> 09:28.550
She said that she had friends 
from out of town last weekend,

09:28.550 --> 09:30.506
maybe for a special occasion.

09:30.506 --> 09:35.113
Eloise Barnes.
Date of birth, last Thursday.

09:35.113 --> 09:37.388
Maybe the trumpet piece was a gift.

09:37.388 --> 09:40.278
Well, he might've planned 
to give it to her in person.

09:40.278 --> 09:44.917
His credit card records show 
a limo charge on Thursday.

09:45.963 --> 09:47.394
There's no reservation under "Lyle."

09:47.394 --> 09:50.879
The limousine company said the pickup 
was supposed to be from here.

09:51.151 --> 09:53.358
What about a "Barnes?" 
Dr. Barnes?

09:53.358 --> 09:55.314
Dr. Barnes was here, yes.

09:56.085 --> 09:59.531
You know her? / She's been coming 
here since we opened 20 years ago.

09:59.531 --> 10:01.345
Was she here with him last Thursday?

10:01.345 --> 10:02.578
With him? No.

10:02.578 --> 10:05.339
She was here with her husband,
their daughter, Camilla,

10:05.339 --> 10:06.809
and another couple.

10:06.809 --> 10:09.438
- This young man was not with them.
- But he was here.

10:09.438 --> 10:11.556
Was there a scene?

10:11.556 --> 10:14.095
Mr. Barnes escorted him out.

10:14.095 --> 10:16.173
Well, that sounds exciting.

10:16.173 --> 10:18.209
The Barnes are always very lively.

10:18.209 --> 10:20.065
How often is always?

10:20.065 --> 10:23.167
They have a standing reservation,
Wednesday and Friday, 7:30.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.706
They walk in together lately?

10:25.816 --> 10:28.965
She's run a little late the past month.

10:28.965 --> 10:33.002
I bet she has, Christian being her 
last appointment on those days.

10:33.002 --> 10:36.304
Mr. Barnes mind his wife's tardiness?

10:36.304 --> 10:39.634
He can't really complain. He's usually 
late coming in from the hospital.

10:39.634 --> 10:44.382
- He's a doctor too?
- No, he's a psychologist.

10:44.382 --> 10:48.566
One of those people who can't 
keep their boundaries clear.

10:48.838 --> 10:51.088
Office Of David Clayton Bellevue Mental Clinic
11367 York Street
Thursday, February 12

10:51.088 --> 10:53.502
Graham was on 
call Tuesday evening.

10:53.502 --> 10:56.944
He was in and out of his office,
but he was here for an intake at 8:00.

10:56.944 --> 10:58.558
His clients come in off the street?

10:58.558 --> 11:01.115
Some.
Some are court-mandated.

11:01.115 --> 11:03.637
Therapy's a condition 
of their sentencing.

11:04.947 --> 11:07.526
Can we see his appointments 
from that night?

11:07.560 --> 11:09.072
Yeah.

11:09.782 --> 11:11.278
Let's see.

11:12.854 --> 11:16.155
- Yeah. He had one at 6:00.
- 6:00, yeah.

11:20.262 --> 11:24.396
Uh, did Mr. Barnes have a special 
interest in male criminal pathology?

11:24.396 --> 11:27.336
Because it seems that, well,

11:27.336 --> 11:31.137
most of his...
all of his clients are men.

11:31.251 --> 11:33.789
Gee, what are the odds?

11:35.324 --> 11:39.742
He'll be allowed to accept female 
clients again in a few months.

11:42.977 --> 11:44.988
Mr. Clayton,

11:44.988 --> 11:50.728
if there was a complaint filed 
by one of his clients against him,

11:50.728 --> 11:53.043
we need to know.

11:54.055 --> 11:59.757
A client alleged Graham was sexually 
inappropriate and that he threatened her.

11:59.757 --> 12:03.699
But she kept changing her story,
so Graham was exonerated.

12:03.699 --> 12:06.339
But you're still taking precautions.

12:06.339 --> 12:07.912
Yeah.

12:10.701 --> 12:12.434
- What?
- My eyes!

12:12.434 --> 12:14.011
- What is it? Let me see.
- No.

12:14.011 --> 12:16.189
Let me... Come on.

12:21.328 --> 12:23.223
You think that's funny?

12:23.223 --> 12:25.619
A man is dead!

12:28.430 --> 12:30.828
I just came in to say good night.

12:32.141 --> 12:33.896
Good night, baby.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.906
He wasn't a man.

12:36.906 --> 12:38.459
He was a puppy.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.879
Apartment Of Tanya Coker
Brooklyn, New York
Friday, February 13

12:49.879 --> 12:53.359
I made that complaint when 
I wasn't in my best frame of mind.

12:53.359 --> 12:57.349
But it sounds like you and Graham had 
a relationship outside of therapy.

12:57.349 --> 12:58.927
A sex relationship.

12:58.927 --> 13:00.840
You claimed that 
he made a threat?

13:00.840 --> 13:02.215
Against my life.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.904
Do you have proof? Because we 
can help you get a restraining order.

13:07.137 --> 13:10.177
I get it. He dumped her,
so she filed a false complaint against him.

13:10.177 --> 13:12.494
I'm gonna call the probation officer.

13:12.494 --> 13:14.389
Graham bought a gun.

13:16.345 --> 13:18.039
You helped him?

13:19.474 --> 13:22.856
Is that why you didn't tell us 
about the gun before?

13:24.878 --> 13:27.724
It would violate your probation?

13:27.724 --> 13:32.473
Graham said he had 
people bothering him,

13:32.473 --> 13:35.561
so I hooked him up 
with my friend K.J.

13:35.561 --> 13:38.309
How does buying a gun 
turn into a threat?

13:38.309 --> 13:42.591
Graham used to make me pick him up 
at the hospital and bring him here,

13:42.591 --> 13:47.347
and last month 
I found his wallet in my car,

13:47.456 --> 13:48.861
and this was in it.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.951
It's, uh, five names:

13:55.951 --> 14:02.188
Eloise Barnes, David Clayton, K.J. Mickens,
Tanya Coker and Frank Lasday.

14:02.438 --> 14:05.710
I filed the complaint 
because he was gonna kill me.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.505
And the others?

14:10.427 --> 14:12.103
A hit list.

14:13.369 --> 14:17.755
Barnes jumped over the boundary 
and off the deep end.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.562
Barnes just wanted 
a night out on the town.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.632
I took him to some 
biker bars on Avenue D.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.260
He loved it.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.058
And buying a gun,
Tanya just made that up?

14:30.058 --> 14:35.037
He just kept grinding 
about all the asswipes in his life.

14:35.037 --> 14:37.898
I set him up 
with a couple of good buys,

14:37.898 --> 14:40.959
but the guy was picky.
I mean, he didn't buy anything.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.993
He loved it, that's what you said.

14:42.993 --> 14:44.600
Even though he didn't find a gun?

14:44.600 --> 14:48.209
We ended up in 
an after-hours dive up in the Bronx.

14:48.209 --> 14:51.761
He was telling stories 
about being in Africa,

14:51.761 --> 14:54.535
in the bush, 
drinking goat's blood.

14:54.535 --> 14:55.807
Uh, goat's blood?

14:55.807 --> 14:56.840
Yeah.

14:56.840 --> 15:02.500
He took his wife and his kid out in the middle 
of the night to see some witch doctor kill a goat.

15:02.500 --> 15:07.470
The wife and kid freaked out,
but Barnes drank the blood.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.887
It was an anthropological expedition.

15:09.887 --> 15:11.803
I was never going to buy a gun.

15:11.803 --> 15:15.836
Putting yourself and 
your family into frightening situations,

15:15.836 --> 15:17.411
that's exciting to you, isn't it?

15:17.411 --> 15:20.017
Unless you people have 
some facts to talk about...

15:20.017 --> 15:23.681
Here's a fact.
He put Tanya Coker in fear for her life.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.883
That drug-fried pathological liar.

15:26.883 --> 15:29.082
I treated her destructive behavior.

15:29.082 --> 15:30.553
And how does she thank me?

15:30.553 --> 15:33.232
With a baseless complaint.

15:33.232 --> 15:39.205
And what about your boss, 
David Clayton, and Frank Lasday?

15:39.205 --> 15:43.576
A parasite. He thought hiring 
Eloise would raise his status.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.958
What is this litany of names?

15:47.749 --> 15:52.739
They're all on this list,
along with his wife and his pal K.J.

15:52.739 --> 15:55.518
He has scores to settle.

15:55.518 --> 15:57.476
I've never seen this in my life.

15:57.476 --> 15:58.989
It was in your wallet.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.420
You took my wallet 
when you arrested me.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.395
You planted this.

16:06.874 --> 16:09.554
We mean your old wallet.

16:10.226 --> 16:12.243
We found that in Tanya's car.

16:12.243 --> 16:14.316
It must've fallen out of your pocket.

16:14.316 --> 16:17.665
You know, your life would be 
much better without these people.

16:17.665 --> 16:20.958
Then, of course,
one name jumped to the top:

16:20.958 --> 16:23.294
Eloise's lover.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.811
This kid, half your age.

16:31.811 --> 16:33.163
That isn't mine.

16:33.163 --> 16:36.168
It's yours, with your social security card,
your credit card.

16:36.168 --> 16:38.333
She stole those from me.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.348
You didn't report them missing.

16:40.348 --> 16:42.767
Diner's Card? 
I never use it.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.657
When would I need 
a social security card?

16:45.657 --> 16:48.261
I don't want to talk 
to them anymore.

16:50.497 --> 16:53.922
Maybe Ms. Coker is 
a pathological liar.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.228
Barnes is the liar.

16:56.604 --> 16:59.257
He had other cards in these slots.

16:59.448 --> 17:03.412
The leather has become embossed with his 
name and the numbers from another one.

17:03.412 --> 17:07.375
Expiration date,
it's August 1996.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.371
The leather, 
it's dry and cracked.

17:09.371 --> 17:12.662
I don't think this wallet 
has been used for years.

17:13.059 --> 17:14.165
Eloise.

17:14.165 --> 17:18.753
She tossed one of Barnes's old wallets 
into Tanya Coker's car, with a hit list.

17:18.753 --> 17:21.271
To break up his affair with Tanya.

17:21.271 --> 17:24.027
And now he lies about 
the wallet to protect his wife.

17:24.027 --> 17:28.601
What a guy. / He still tried to buy a gun,
and I assume he's still a murder suspect,

17:28.601 --> 17:30.416
so let's get him arraigned.

17:34.674 --> 17:38.878
What do you think,
all bark and no bite?

17:38.878 --> 17:40.514
Could be.

17:43.386 --> 17:48.766
You know, the last name 
on the list, Frank Lasday,

17:49.375 --> 17:55.119
I wonder why Eloise would put 
one of her own patients on the list.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.744
Eloise was only my therapist 
for three months.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.038
I never met her husband.

17:59.038 --> 18:00.933
He called you a parasite.

18:00.933 --> 18:03.612
They're despicable people.
They deserve each other.

18:03.612 --> 18:07.098
I mean, two shrinks?
What could be worse?

18:07.098 --> 18:09.278
Right. Spending the whole day 
analyzing each other.

18:09.278 --> 18:12.538
Worse.
They talk about their patients.

18:15.350 --> 18:20.906
Eloise... She told her husband 
something that you revealed in therapy?

18:20.906 --> 18:23.466
I told her I was abused by my father.

18:23.466 --> 18:27.848
Next thing I know, a mutual friend tells me 
Graham Barnes mentioned it to him.

18:27.848 --> 18:30.525
- You confront Eloise about it?
- Oh, she denied it.

18:30.525 --> 18:33.593
Said some crap 
about buying new locks.

18:33.593 --> 18:35.678
She's damn lucky I didn't sue her.

18:35.678 --> 18:36.764
Hey, Daddy!

18:36.764 --> 18:38.849
I owe somebody a hot chocolate.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.254
I'm hungry.

18:42.460 --> 18:44.910
Considering what Eloise
thinks of psychologists,

18:44.910 --> 18:47.568
I wouldn't think she'd blab
to Graham about her patients.

18:47.568 --> 18:50.768
She mentioned changing the locks.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.778
If Graham had a key,
maybe he read her files.

18:53.778 --> 18:57.370
If he thought she was fooling 
around with her patients, sure.

18:58.322 --> 19:01.016
Eloise had said 
Christian was a masochist.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.052
He hurt himself, not others.

19:03.052 --> 19:05.356
Urinating on her desk 
doesn't fit his pathology.

19:05.356 --> 19:08.736
If Christian didn't do it,
then Graham?

19:09.729 --> 19:12.737
Graham wanted Eloise 
to think that Christian did it...

19:12.737 --> 19:16.080
by mimicking his pathology.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.694
He read his files...

19:17.694 --> 19:20.354
But if it had the wrong information...

19:21.326 --> 19:23.079
We need a search warrant.

19:25.628 --> 19:26.982
Their phones are off,

19:26.982 --> 19:29.939
but they'll check 
voice mail at intermission.

19:29.939 --> 19:31.594
They're gonna freak out,
you barging in here like this.

19:31.594 --> 19:35.927
We barged in so no one would be tempted to 
destroy Christian's file before we get a look at it.

19:35.927 --> 19:38.515
We understand why
you're being protective, you know,

19:38.515 --> 19:40.896
especially because of the break-in.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.659
Your mother said that you were 
with friends, sending them off.

19:44.659 --> 19:45.892
Was your father with you?

19:45.892 --> 19:48.128
We met for brunch at their hotel.

19:48.128 --> 19:50.907
He got tied up on a phone call.
He joined us later.

19:50.907 --> 19:53.040
Oh, that might be my parents.

19:53.231 --> 19:54.871
Okay.

19:54.871 --> 19:57.892
Eloise's notes on Christian.

19:58.744 --> 20:01.745
There's no mention of masochism.

20:01.915 --> 20:04.243
Here.

20:04.616 --> 20:09.604
"Poor impulse control.
Transient psychotic episodes."

20:09.604 --> 20:14.961
These are symptoms of 
borderline personality disorder.

20:15.958 --> 20:20.651
The kind of pathology consistent 
with defiling her office.

20:20.651 --> 20:24.725
She put these notes in here knowing 
Graham would read them and act accordingly.

20:26.541 --> 20:28.335
She set a trap.

20:29.751 --> 20:31.587
Graham's prints are on the file.

20:31.587 --> 20:35.037
He staged the break-in to frighten 
Eloise into breaking up with Christian,

20:35.037 --> 20:37.766
and he probably tricked Christian
into showing up at her birthday party.

20:37.766 --> 20:41.294
After she sabotaged his affair 
with Tanya with a bogus hit list.

20:41.294 --> 20:43.412
This is a marriage?
These people need counseling.

20:43.412 --> 20:46.256
These two would eat 
a marriage counselor for lunch.

20:46.256 --> 20:48.714
They prefer this game, you know.

20:48.714 --> 20:52.046
They've probably been 
playing it since they met.

20:52.046 --> 20:54.814
One of them decided 
to play for keeps.

20:54.814 --> 20:57.000
I told them you'd object,
but they had a warrant.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.322
Of course you blame 
the wife's alcoholism.

20:59.322 --> 21:02.708
Never mind the husband's 
a narcissist who refused to get a job.

21:02.708 --> 21:05.373
It was the '50s.
What kind of straight job could he do?

21:05.373 --> 21:07.148
He'd been a jazz musician 
his whole life.

21:07.148 --> 21:09.893
Dad. / Figures you'd pick 
a play aboutjazz musicians.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.049
- I tried to call you.
- We know, sweetie.

21:12.049 --> 21:13.822
No, I didn't pick the play.

21:13.822 --> 21:16.017
- You picked the play.
- You bought the tickets.

21:16.017 --> 21:19.897
I had to cancel all my credit cards after 
they'd been passed around the police station.

21:19.897 --> 21:22.739
Don't make yourself out to be a victim.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.173
You were trying to buy a gun.

21:24.173 --> 21:29.082
Mom... / The hell I was. You and that 
meth-head cooked up the whole thing.

21:34.133 --> 21:37.130
I was at school grading papers 
that Tuesday night.

21:37.130 --> 21:40.188
I called Mom.
She was home, doing paperwork.

21:40.188 --> 21:43.254
What about your dad? His boss 
said he was M.I.A. for a few hours.

21:43.254 --> 21:45.345
Why do you keep 
hounding my parents?

21:45.345 --> 21:47.167
Their patients are disturbed people.

21:47.167 --> 21:49.433
They aren't accountable 
for what happens to them.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.347
We think your mother was having 
an affair with this particular patient.

21:53.347 --> 21:55.646
My mother does not have affairs.

21:55.646 --> 21:58.814
Well, she dresses 
very sexy for a therapist.

21:58.814 --> 22:00.507
I mean, she didn't always do that.

22:00.507 --> 22:02.753
She's become more 
comfortable with her sexuality.

22:02.753 --> 22:05.775
That doesn't mean she's 
having sex outside her marriage.

22:05.775 --> 22:07.981
Your mother talks to you 
about her sexuality?

22:07.981 --> 22:09.832
That'd be inappropriate, wouldn't it?

22:09.832 --> 22:12.039
If my mom dressed like that,
I'd be mortified.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.099
And my dad... Oh, boy.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.467
But that's why your mom does it, 
doesn't she,

22:16.467 --> 22:18.022
to provoke your father?

22:18.022 --> 22:20.526
You make our home 
sound like high school.

22:20.526 --> 22:24.934
My parents are smarter than most people,
but our family's like any other.

22:24.934 --> 22:29.178
Well, yeah. This birthday 
party's like any other family.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.802
How old are you here?

22:30.802 --> 22:33.477
Nine. My parents took the picture.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.454
You know,

22:34.454 --> 22:39.954
this looks like the same restaurant 
that your mother had her birthday party at.

22:44.251 --> 22:47.171
You know what? Uh...

22:47.335 --> 22:49.800
You know,

22:49.800 --> 22:55.659
what did you think when 
Christian Lyle came in with the flowers?

22:55.659 --> 22:57.233
Nothing.

22:57.233 --> 23:01.036
I've been hearing about 
transference since I was a child.

23:01.036 --> 23:02.451
And if you like family photos so much,

23:02.451 --> 23:05.356
why don't you look at the ones 
where we're enjoying ourselves?

23:05.356 --> 23:07.311
You mean like this?

23:07.311 --> 23:08.966
What's this, a safari?

23:08.966 --> 23:13.120
In Zimbabwe. Dad had us 
camp out in a predator park.

23:13.120 --> 23:16.018
With lions, tigers and bears?
Sounds reckless.

23:16.018 --> 23:18.775
My father isn't afraid of life.

23:18.775 --> 23:22.176
He can handle himself 
in any situation.

23:22.176 --> 23:27.277
Ask his coworkers. Ask them who kept the 
generators going during the blackout last summer.

23:27.277 --> 23:31.299
People think Dad's corrosive,

23:31.299 --> 23:34.096
like the surface of this painting.

23:34.096 --> 23:37.420
But Mom and I know 
what he's like inside.

23:42.263 --> 23:45.115
This is the Williamsburg Bridge.

23:46.004 --> 23:47.459
Where'd they get this?

23:47.459 --> 23:49.375
My mother bought it from the artist.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.709
It's copper.

23:50.709 --> 23:52.482
Did she go to his studio?

23:52.482 --> 23:53.635
Yes.

23:53.635 --> 23:55.691
He treats her like a queen.

23:55.691 --> 23:58.248
Excuse me. 
I have to make a phone call.

24:04.071 --> 24:06.941
Is this what you mean 
by art that makes you think?

24:09.238 --> 24:10.893
Well, it makes me think of Eloise.

24:10.893 --> 24:14.135
The finish, it's acid-wash.

24:15.146 --> 24:17.360
Studio Of Luke Vinton
Brooklyn, New York
Wednesday, Febryary 18

24:17.360 --> 24:21.620
We love what Eloise has.
The colors are perfect for our master bath.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.693
How does this stuff 
hold up in the humidity?

24:23.693 --> 24:26.565
- What is it, some kind of a wash?
- Sst!

24:27.860 --> 24:31.098
It's complicated,
but basically I use sulfuric acid.

24:31.098 --> 24:33.815
Acid? How do you 
dispose of the acid?

24:33.815 --> 24:35.727
Do you just dump it out here?

24:35.727 --> 24:38.084
No. I keep it in those tubs.

24:38.084 --> 24:40.920
But it's all wide open.
Anyone could come in here:

24:40.920 --> 24:43.096
Cats, little children.

24:43.268 --> 24:45.383
I gotta ask you something, Luke.

24:46.013 --> 24:52.180
Eloise's got one of your big 
honkin' pieces in her living room.

24:52.180 --> 24:53.753
Why is that?

24:54.305 --> 24:57.975
She bought that piece 
after I decked her husband.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.203
There was an artist's studio tour.

25:00.203 --> 25:02.238
I was showing Eloise my work.

25:02.238 --> 25:04.036
I came outside and, uh...

25:04.036 --> 25:06.961
Graham was showing 
his work to your girlfriend.

25:06.961 --> 25:08.354
He had her cornered.

25:08.354 --> 25:09.488
I clocked him.

25:09.488 --> 25:12.424
So now she's, like,
I guess your biggest fan, right?

25:12.424 --> 25:15.105
And she always sends people like you.

25:15.105 --> 25:17.422
Actually, we came on our own.

25:18.153 --> 25:20.889
Great. That mean 
you're not buying anything?

25:20.889 --> 25:23.314
We'll take samples of your acid tubs.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.189
Okay, guys, let's get started.

25:25.189 --> 25:28.123
It's sulfuric acid.
Same stuff used in the murder.

25:28.123 --> 25:32.585
But your samples contained copper.
The acid from the murder had lead sulfate.

25:32.585 --> 25:34.420
Lead like in car batteries.

25:34.420 --> 25:37.074
Sure.
This lead had low specific gravity.

25:37.074 --> 25:39.450
Probably a used car battery.

25:40.021 --> 25:42.155
The Barnes don't own a car.

25:42.687 --> 25:44.562
The blackout.

25:44.772 --> 25:48.965
Camilla said that Graham kept 
the generators running at the hospital.

25:50.035 --> 25:53.065
Well, generators use 
lead-acid batteries, don't they?

25:56.485 --> 25:58.078
That was Penell.

26:00.395 --> 26:02.473
He heard I might be rearrested...

26:02.473 --> 26:08.087
because my fingerprints were 
on some batteries at the hospital.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.616
I'm not following you, Graham.

26:10.616 --> 26:16.597
Penell says they can hold me in jail 
until they decide I'm innocent.

26:19.564 --> 26:22.301
And how does that make you feel?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.647
Don't!

26:26.765 --> 26:29.180
I need your help, Eloise.

26:31.004 --> 26:32.588
I need...

26:32.588 --> 26:34.984
I need you to have me committed.

26:36.458 --> 26:40.340
I can't sign the papers.
I am your wife.

26:40.340 --> 26:43.928
Then get Laurie 
and Jonathan to do it.

26:43.928 --> 26:45.661
But you write it up.

26:45.661 --> 26:47.878
I need protection.

26:51.158 --> 26:53.516
You won, okay?

26:53.516 --> 26:56.804
I'll be your... 
your good boy.

26:56.804 --> 26:59.482
I just...

27:00.535 --> 27:03.373
I just don't want to go to jail.

27:04.947 --> 27:06.562
The commitment papers are in order.

27:06.562 --> 27:10.280
This is not an attempt to evade arrest,
but to avoid a travesty.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.329
He's not here.

27:11.329 --> 27:13.715
He was admitted to 
Edgewood Institute last night.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.749
Your client's only 
delaying the inevitable.

27:15.749 --> 27:18.876
Whether now or in 60 days, 
he'll be in our custody.

27:18.876 --> 27:23.410
My husband has a major depressive 
disorder with psychotic features.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.876
His condition has been 
deteriorating for months.

27:25.876 --> 27:29.318
He's a danger to himself 
and to others.

27:29.318 --> 27:30.547
You wrote this yourself?

27:30.547 --> 27:34.514
The papers are signed 
by Drs. Coddington and Beale.

27:34.845 --> 27:37.694
She just cited the report verbatim.

27:37.694 --> 27:40.273
I mean, they signed it, 
but she wrote it.

27:40.273 --> 27:42.669
What's going on? Where's Dad?

27:43.460 --> 27:45.052
Oh, Cami.

27:45.843 --> 27:49.945
Your father agreed to go someplace 
where he would be safe.

27:49.945 --> 27:52.082
What? When?

27:52.082 --> 27:53.849
Last night.

27:53.849 --> 27:55.785
He didn't want to wake you.

27:57.559 --> 27:59.273
He did it for himself.

27:59.273 --> 28:02.210
Actually, your mother did it for him.

28:02.210 --> 28:04.565
She wrote the commitment papers.

28:08.848 --> 28:11.707
This is what you've
wanted all along, isn't it?

28:11.707 --> 28:13.763
I hope you're happy.

28:14.174 --> 28:16.418
This is not over.

28:19.204 --> 28:21.223
He's confined to the institute.

28:21.223 --> 28:24.445
Unless we prevail at a competency hearing,
he's out of our reach.

28:24.445 --> 28:26.085
Thanks to Eloise.

28:26.085 --> 28:29.348
You would've thought she would've 
enjoyed seeing him locked up.

28:29.348 --> 28:32.238
No. This way he's 
totally at her mercy.

28:32.238 --> 28:34.681
It's what she wanted all along.
Even Camilla saw that.

28:34.681 --> 28:37.388
The daughter directed her 
comments at you, Detective.

28:37.388 --> 28:39.361
Transference.
It was meant for her mother.

28:39.361 --> 28:41.235
I'm a safer target.

28:41.235 --> 28:43.150
The last thing she said,
that's the interesting part.

28:43.150 --> 28:46.157
- "This is not over." 
- "This" being what?

28:46.157 --> 28:48.447
This family makes me want 
to go home and kiss my wife.

28:48.447 --> 28:50.078
You know, Camilla,

28:50.078 --> 28:54.452
she made a point of telling us about 
how her father kept the generators going.

28:54.452 --> 28:57.769
The acid-wash painting,
she directed our attention to it.

28:57.769 --> 29:01.003
She was helping us make 
a case against her parents.

29:01.468 --> 29:04.490
The game isn't over.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.464
Camilla's game.

29:07.923 --> 29:10.822
Can't say for sure if Camilla was here 
that night, but she often stays late.

29:10.822 --> 29:12.173
You know how she gets home?

29:12.173 --> 29:14.106
A taxi or maybe 
a boyfriend picks her up?

29:14.106 --> 29:16.782
I don't think she has a boyfriend,
and she takes the subway.

29:16.782 --> 29:19.490
12 blocks away?

29:19.490 --> 29:22.748
- By herself?
- Yes. Her choice.

29:22.748 --> 29:26.236
But... And this school, way up in the Bronx,
I mean, that's also her choice?

29:26.236 --> 29:29.829
Yes. She was offered 
P.S. 191 on the Lower East Side.

29:29.829 --> 29:31.923
Safer neighborhoods,
one block from the subway.

29:31.923 --> 29:33.657
I'm glad she chose us.

29:36.236 --> 29:37.788
This is her classroom.

29:38.179 --> 29:42.312
Jamie, didn't Ms. Barnes tell you she had 
a meeting this afternoon and couldn't tutor you?

29:43.122 --> 29:45.135
I wanted to do some math 
on the computer.

29:45.135 --> 29:46.559
I don't have one at home.

29:46.559 --> 29:48.217
Air wrench.

29:48.330 --> 29:52.249
Lots of garages in the neighborhood,
with Dumpsters full of old car batteries.

29:52.249 --> 29:53.923
You can't be here unsupervised.

29:53.923 --> 29:55.857
I'll call your aunt to come pick you up.

29:56.248 --> 29:58.302
I said she ain't there.

30:01.062 --> 30:03.541
Grown-ups never listen to kids.

30:05.234 --> 30:10.138
I'll bet Ms. Barnes listens to you, huh?

30:11.541 --> 30:15.796
Does she talk to you 
about grown-ups,

30:15.796 --> 30:18.074
talk to you about your parents?

30:18.074 --> 30:19.547
I don't have parents.

30:19.547 --> 30:21.503
Just my aunt.

30:21.503 --> 30:24.362
Did Ms. Barnes talk 
to you about that?

30:24.362 --> 30:27.610
She says I'm not missing anything.

30:27.921 --> 30:30.839
I gotta do geography now.

30:31.631 --> 30:33.746
What's this? "Jazz."

30:33.746 --> 30:36.926
Musicians, 
they come to play for us.

30:36.926 --> 30:40.013
Ms. Barnes recorded it 
on the computer.

30:40.013 --> 30:41.948
Was there a trumpet player?

30:42.398 --> 30:44.873
Can we hear a little bit of it?

30:47.473 --> 30:49.388
It got erased.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.279
Rehearsal Hall
School Of Music
Friday, February 20

30:54.279 --> 30:57.918
It was me on upright bass,
James on sax, Dwayne on drums.

30:57.918 --> 30:59.431
We're the core of the quartet.

30:59.431 --> 31:01.385
Christian came 
by when he felt like it.

31:01.385 --> 31:04.571
Christian just happened to feel like it 
when you went to P.S. 360?

31:04.571 --> 31:06.126
Teacher's request.

31:06.126 --> 31:08.010
Did she ask for him by name?

31:08.010 --> 31:09.563
Yeah.

31:09.853 --> 31:11.386
How'd Christian like Camilla?

31:11.386 --> 31:13.261
Oh, she didn't rate.

31:13.756 --> 31:15.224
Not like she didn't try.

31:15.224 --> 31:20.118
She had on a short skirt, blouse,
you know, showing her stuff.

31:20.550 --> 31:22.825
You record your own performances?

31:23.137 --> 31:24.792
Yeah.

31:24.792 --> 31:29.215
Did you record the one at P.S. 360?

31:31.953 --> 31:34.660
And she wanted to engage him 
without letting on who she was.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.915
Simple curiosity.

31:35.915 --> 31:37.890
If she thought her 
mother was having an affair...

31:37.890 --> 31:39.176
Her mother probably told her.

31:39.176 --> 31:43.434
She knew Christian's name,
that he went to Juilliard, played in a quartet.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.684
She even dressed like 
her mother for the occasion.

31:45.684 --> 31:48.039
Probably 'cause Mom told her 
what Christian liked.

31:48.039 --> 31:51.040
I can just imagine being 22,
no boyfriend,

31:51.040 --> 31:54.409
hearing Mom talk about this hot fling 
she had with a guy my age.

31:54.409 --> 31:56.983
- I'd be furious.
- At your mother.

31:59.370 --> 32:00.524
We've got her.

32:00.524 --> 32:03.610
Unless it's an admission 
of guilt by Camilla.

32:04.422 --> 32:08.335
Not-Not quite, but it's something 
that she wouldn't want Eloise to hear.

32:08.335 --> 32:11.054
Graham Barnes still has a clear motive.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.270
He killed his wife's lover.

32:12.270 --> 32:15.568
That's something that 
a jury can wrap its arms around.

32:16.984 --> 32:19.682
Carver. Hold on.

32:21.115 --> 32:24.033
Someone named Phillipe,
from a restaurant.

32:27.748 --> 32:31.877
Um, you have a competency 
hearing scheduled for Barnes, don't you?

32:31.877 --> 32:33.429
Yes, next Wednesday.

32:34.607 --> 32:37.043
Call Camilla as our witness.

32:37.043 --> 32:39.268
So she can tell the judge 
how insane her father is?

32:39.268 --> 32:41.282
That doesn't help us.

32:41.952 --> 32:43.644
Well, it depends what you ask her.

32:45.903 --> 32:47.899
Why did they ask her to testify?

32:47.899 --> 32:50.074
She doesn't know anything.

32:50.585 --> 32:51.937
She's not a professional.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.424
If the judge rules that 
Graham is mentally fit,

32:54.424 --> 32:59.176
then he could order him released 
from the institute and into police custody.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.241
Thank God Laurie and 
Jonathan are testifying.

33:05.015 --> 33:08.081
They'll know 
what they're talking about.

33:08.081 --> 33:10.440
Edgeview Mental Institute
Westchester Count, New York
Wednesday, February 25

33:10.440 --> 33:13.681
His behavior got more erratic.
I didn't know what to expect.

33:13.681 --> 33:17.249
That's not the heroic picture 
you presented to the police.

33:17.249 --> 33:20.812
You said he could handle any situation.

33:20.812 --> 33:22.528
I was in denial.

33:22.528 --> 33:24.123
Denial?

33:24.123 --> 33:27.232
Didn't you make a point to mention 
your father's quick thinking?

33:27.232 --> 33:31.986
You told the detectives that your father 
kept the generators going at his hospital.

33:31.986 --> 33:36.260
In fact, that's how they connected him 
to the battery acid used in the murder.

33:38.587 --> 33:40.926
I was just very proud of my father.

33:40.926 --> 33:42.660
Oh, for God's sake.

33:42.660 --> 33:47.131
In that same conversation, didn't you use 
a painting by your mother's favorite artist...

33:47.131 --> 33:49.771
to draw an analogy to your father?

33:50.262 --> 33:51.575
I don't specifically remember.

33:51.575 --> 33:55.900
That your father isn't what he appears to be,
that he's not as destructive as the sulfuric acid...

33:55.900 --> 33:57.995
your mother's favorite artist 
used in his work?

33:57.995 --> 33:59.608
Stop her, stop her!

33:59.608 --> 34:03.539
Your Honor, the witness is not 
qualified to offer an opinion on this.

34:03.539 --> 34:05.233
She is a grammar school teacher.

34:05.233 --> 34:09.606
She can certainly offer her impressions 
of the defendant's behavior.

34:09.606 --> 34:13.067
I'll allow it.
Answer the question, Ms. Barnes.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.436
I might've...

34:17.286 --> 34:19.081
l... The police misunderstood.

34:19.081 --> 34:24.036
They misunderstood when you said your 
father provided for you a normal home life,

34:24.036 --> 34:30.782
filled with family vacations 
and birthday parties like this one?

34:31.434 --> 34:32.886
Yes, like that one.

34:32.886 --> 34:36.458
And as much as your parents would
like you to say otherwise,

34:36.458 --> 34:38.817
life with Father was normal.

34:38.817 --> 34:41.493
That's what you said to the police?

34:42.466 --> 34:44.742
Yes, I guess I did.

34:45.275 --> 34:46.827
No further questions, Your Honor.

34:46.827 --> 34:48.181
Thank you, Ms. Barnes.

34:48.181 --> 34:51.208
The parties will have 
my decision in 30 minutes.

34:52.281 --> 34:53.995
Mr. Carver, can I have a word?

34:53.995 --> 34:55.972
Surely. Mr. Penell?

34:59.014 --> 35:00.507
Where'd they go?

35:00.507 --> 35:01.802
Well, it looks like you 
might've done it, huh?

35:01.802 --> 35:03.355
Sent Dad to jail.

35:03.355 --> 35:05.148
I don't want that.

35:05.699 --> 35:12.201
For once, you've snatched 
the victory from the jaws of your mother,

35:13.154 --> 35:16.955
showed your parents just 
how smart you really are.

35:16.955 --> 35:18.470
They know. 
They raised me.

35:18.470 --> 35:21.239
Raised you?
Wolves would've done a better job.

35:21.239 --> 35:24.208
I think they were busy playing games.

35:24.208 --> 35:25.337
I don't think they were 
paying attention to you.

35:25.337 --> 35:27.856
You were paying attention to them.

35:27.856 --> 35:34.503
You know, you would've been proud the way 
she drew our attention to Luke Vinton's painting.

35:34.503 --> 35:37.612
And the little clue 
she dropped about the blackout.

35:37.612 --> 35:45.201
It was as smooth as your remark about psychologists 
not knowing where their boundaries are.

35:45.913 --> 35:49.544
You see, that's why 
we suspected you first.

35:49.936 --> 35:52.153
How dare you!

35:52.327 --> 35:55.726
You're hardly one to talk,
taking a whiz on her desk.

35:55.726 --> 35:58.365
That was my wife's stud.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.788
As she can vouch,
he had a personality disorder.

36:01.788 --> 36:06.905
You didn't tell him about the phony 
psych profile you put in Christian's file?

36:08.561 --> 36:11.258
- You little sneak.
- Don't blame me.

36:11.258 --> 36:13.776
Blame your insane jealousy.

36:13.776 --> 36:19.988
What was it that you told 
Jamie about not having parents?

36:19.988 --> 36:22.636
"You're not missing anything."

36:22.636 --> 36:23.769
Right?

36:23.769 --> 36:25.904
The kid's a pathological liar.

36:25.904 --> 36:28.503
I respect and love you both.

36:29.535 --> 36:33.984
Well, that's, uh, very generous,

36:33.984 --> 36:35.981
considering how they neglected you.

36:35.981 --> 36:40.670
Excuse me. You're a detective 
and a child psychologist?

36:41.222 --> 36:43.581
Well, I don't need a degree...

36:44.594 --> 36:46.230
because I have this.

36:48.187 --> 36:53.528
This, um, you know,
normal birthday party.

36:54.781 --> 36:57.640
Mr. Barnes, did you take this photo?
Or your wife?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.476
I did.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.552
You were wearing a tux?

37:01.552 --> 37:03.046
Why would I wear a tux?

37:03.046 --> 37:08.187
Because... in the reflection 
in the mirror at the back.

37:08.187 --> 37:09.861
See?

37:09.861 --> 37:13.856
You can see that the person 
who took the photo is wearing a tux.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.400
Like Phillipe the maitre d' used to.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.318
In fact, he even told us 
he took the photograph.

37:19.318 --> 37:22.705
Well, that guy can't hold 
two reservations in his head.

37:22.705 --> 37:29.306
He also remembers you sending 
Camilla there to the restaurant alone,

37:29.306 --> 37:32.466
sharing cake with 
the maitre d' and the waiter.

37:32.466 --> 37:35.219
Where'd you guys... 
I guess, well,

37:35.219 --> 37:38.613
you and your wife had 
something better to do that night.

37:38.613 --> 37:41.299
Camilla was always 
an independent child.

37:41.299 --> 37:43.014
It's her nature.

37:43.985 --> 37:48.141
The nature of a child is 
for her parents...

37:48.141 --> 37:52.220
to put their needs above theirs.

37:53.574 --> 37:56.737
But they never did, did they?

37:57.368 --> 38:00.226
And they never let you be a child.

38:02.063 --> 38:06.938
They taught you to 
analyze your emotions...

38:06.938 --> 38:10.142
rather than feel them.

38:10.142 --> 38:12.016
So I wouldn't be beholden to them.

38:12.016 --> 38:14.462
I'm grateful for them 
for treating me like a grown-up.

38:14.462 --> 38:20.084
Yeah. Like a peer, you know.
???, sexually, ???

38:20.084 --> 38:22.663
I told you my mother 
was never inappropriate.

38:22.663 --> 38:24.285
She knows the boundaries that...

38:24.285 --> 38:28.868
She even told you about 
how her young lover made her feel.

38:29.700 --> 38:32.621
You know, alive, vibrant.

38:36.988 --> 38:40.983
But she never helped 
you feel that for yourself...

38:40.983 --> 38:42.937
I mean, has she?

38:44.092 --> 38:47.062
Mom, let's go home. 
I want to go.

38:47.062 --> 38:48.617
I can't. I have to wait for the judge.

38:48.617 --> 38:50.609
Your lawyer can call 
you with the decision.

38:50.609 --> 38:53.038
No. She has to wait here with me.

38:53.038 --> 38:55.193
Then let's go to Dad's room.

38:57.934 --> 39:01.427
You recognize 
who's playing, Ms. Barnes?

39:02.439 --> 39:04.920
Mom, come on.

39:05.770 --> 39:07.329
That's Christian.

39:07.329 --> 39:12.727
Playing for the kids with his quartet 
a month ago at P.S. 360.

39:13.920 --> 39:14.974
He came to my classroom.

39:14.974 --> 39:17.451
I didn't know he was the one 
that you told me about.

39:17.451 --> 39:22.901
No. Juilliard said that you 
requested Christian specifically.

39:22.901 --> 39:24.294
Mom, this guy's a megalomaniac.

39:24.294 --> 39:26.631
He fantasizes he knows things 
he can't possibly know.

39:26.631 --> 39:31.247
I love this part. 
It is so sexy.

39:33.245 --> 39:36.716
I actually like the part after this.

39:38.595 --> 39:40.892
Mom, take me out of here.

39:40.892 --> 39:43.288
Show them that you 
can take care of me.

39:43.288 --> 39:45.551
Thank you for that 
amazing performance.

39:45.551 --> 39:49.358
Kids, can we give a special hand 
to Christian for his beautiful solo?

39:49.358 --> 39:50.446
Please stop it.

39:52.722 --> 39:57.250
A friend told me horn players have 
soft lips and nimble fingers. Is it true?

39:57.250 --> 39:59.795
Yeah, sure, whatever you say, Carmen.

39:59.795 --> 40:02.428
"Nimble fingers."

40:02.428 --> 40:04.583
I told you that.

40:06.679 --> 40:10.261
What, were you 
trying to seduce him?

40:10.261 --> 40:12.617
- Mom, please don't.
- He called you "Carmen."

40:12.617 --> 40:15.760
You couldn't even get him 
to remember your name.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.668
She has no right to mock you.

40:20.123 --> 40:23.403
She's the ridiculous one,

40:23.403 --> 40:27.027
taking on a lover half her age.

40:27.027 --> 40:28.984
Flaunting him to you.

40:28.984 --> 40:31.574
It's only natural that 
you would get hurt,

40:31.574 --> 40:34.847
that you would want 
to take him away from her.

40:34.847 --> 40:38.941
Poor inept girl. Where did you 
get the idea to compete with me?

40:38.941 --> 40:40.574
From you!

40:41.407 --> 40:44.367
What did you expect,
telling me about your affair?

40:44.367 --> 40:46.546
It never occurred to me.

40:46.938 --> 40:48.512
How did you think I would feel?

40:48.512 --> 40:51.935
Your feelings are not my responsibility.

40:53.591 --> 40:56.493
See how she plays you?

40:59.212 --> 41:04.468
You see? Look, you saw them 
use Christian as a pawn in their game...

41:04.468 --> 41:06.524
that you were watching...

41:07.395 --> 41:10.016
for, what, 22 years?

41:13.782 --> 41:16.241
And what, you had enough?

41:17.557 --> 41:21.400
It was your turn to 
teach them a lesson.

41:22.454 --> 41:26.572
Tell them that you chose 
a day and a time...

41:26.572 --> 41:29.297
that neither of them 
would have an alibi,

41:29.297 --> 41:33.925
a weapon that could 
be traced to both of them.

41:34.074 --> 41:35.689
Oh, my God.

41:35.689 --> 41:38.319
- Camilla, what did you do?
- Come on.

41:38.319 --> 41:40.654
Come on, Camilla.

41:41.467 --> 41:44.481
Tell them how you were 
able to get close to him...

41:44.481 --> 41:47.320
because he recognized you.

41:48.113 --> 41:49.487
Did he say, "Hey, Carmen"?

41:49.487 --> 41:52.730
Did he... Did that 
make it easier to kill him?

41:55.462 --> 41:56.757
Oh, God.

41:56.757 --> 41:59.438
Cami, don't say anything.

41:59.650 --> 42:01.891
Show them. Come on.

42:02.218 --> 42:08.168
Show them what a... 
a smart child that they conceived together.

42:09.301 --> 42:12.848
Camilla, you're sick.

42:12.848 --> 42:14.263
Oh, so now it's you who's sick.

42:14.263 --> 42:16.324
I'm not sick! You're sick!

42:16.324 --> 42:21.028
That idiot was just a pawn,
and he mattered more to you than I did!

42:22.262 --> 42:24.038
He was nothing.

42:24.038 --> 42:26.835
Killing him was easy, Dad,
like the goat.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.437
Now you can't ignore me.
Now you know who I am.

42:29.437 --> 42:32.193
I'm your daughter! I'm yours!

42:34.522 --> 42:37.811
You are under arrest 
for murder, Camilla.

42:46.402 --> 42:50.711
You're allowed to 
accompany her to the station.

42:59.190 --> 43:02.494
Looks like Camilla will be spending
another birthday alone.

43:02.494 --> 43:08.214
You'd think two people with their credentials 
and education could raise a perfect child.

43:08.214 --> 43:09.990
They thought they did.

43:09.990 --> 43:11.626
That's the problem.
