00:03.503 --> 00:05.422
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.505 --> 00:07.090
- WHAT A TREMENDOUS HONOR.

00:07.173 --> 00:08.883
WELL, OF COURSE
I'LL BE THERE.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.760
[gasps]

00:10.844 --> 00:12.262
I HAVE
A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.931
MY SISTER BESS JUST TOLD ME
CANOGA FALLS

00:15.014 --> 00:17.434
IS NAMING THE TOWN SQUARE
AFTER ME.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.102
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

00:19.185 --> 00:23.565
- DID CANOGA FALLS
LOSE A BET OR SOMETHING?

00:23.648 --> 00:24.983
- NO.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.776
IT IS MY HOMETOWN
IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.777
- [gasps]

00:27.861 --> 00:29.446
- AN IDYLLIC
LITTLE HAMLET

00:29.529 --> 00:31.114
WHERE THE KIDS PLAY
IN THE STREET

00:31.197 --> 00:33.616
AND THE GROCER CALLS
ALL THE CUSTOMERS BY NAME.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.576
- CAN I COME
TO THE CEREMONY?

00:34.659 --> 00:35.952
- PLEASE.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.955
OTHERWISE, I WON'T KNOW
A SOUL THERE.

00:39.038 --> 00:41.124
- I WANNA COME TOO.
ALEC'S OUT OF TOWN.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.251
AND I'VE ALREADY SNOOPED
THROUGH ALL HIS STUFF--

00:43.334 --> 00:45.295
GONE THROUGH THE BROWSING
HISTORY ON ALL HIS COMPUTERS.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.422
FOUND HIS PORN STASH.
NOTHING FREAKY.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.215
NO, JUST THE NORMAL STUFF.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.759
LITTLE HEAVY ON THE THREESOMES
FOR MY TASTE.

00:50.842 --> 00:53.595
BUT I DELETED IT ALL,
SO MY WEEKEND'S FREE.

00:53.678 --> 00:57.724
- WE ALSO WOULD'VE ACCEPTED,
"ALEC'S OUT OF TOWN."

01:00.101 --> 01:02.145
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU VISITED YOUR MOTHER?

01:02.228 --> 01:04.980
- OH, I TRY TO VISIT
EVERY YEAR.

01:05.063 --> 01:08.318
I'VE FAILED
FOR THE LAST 12.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.319
- ARE YOU COMING, ELKA?

01:09.402 --> 01:11.279
- GO TO NEW YORK
TO SEE A SHOW?

01:11.362 --> 01:13.031
I WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.158
- NOBODY SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A SHOW.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.953
- VICTORIA'S FAMILY?
IT'S GOTTA BE A SHOW.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.997
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
ENTIRELY WRONG,

01:21.080 --> 01:23.333
AND MY MOTHER WAS A BIT
OF A LOCAL CELEBRITY.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.794
SHE HAD A TELEVISION SHOW
CALLED <i> MISS PENNY'S PUPPETS.</i>

01:25.877 --> 01:27.378
- OH, THAT SOUNDS FUN.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.215

LIKE THEY WERE REAL.

AND BUDGE THE BEE

01:32.425 --> 01:36.012
DELIVERED ALL THE DIFFICULT NEWS
IN OUR FAMILY.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.473
THEY TOLD ME WHEN MY MOM AND DAD
WERE GETTING DIVORCED.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.016
THEY TAUGHT ME
ABOUT SEX.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.894
- WAIT, SO YOU LITERALLY LEARNED
ABOUT THE BIRDS AND THE BEES

01:42.977 --> 01:46.981
FROM A BIRD
AND A BEE?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.983
- AND YOUR SISTER
STILL LIVES THERE?

01:49.067 --> 01:52.028
- YEAH, BESS NEVER LEFT
CANOGA FALLS.

01:52.111 --> 01:54.405
SHE NEVER MARRIED.
SHE NEVER DID MUCH.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.115
NO, SHE MOSTLY HANGS OUT
WITH MY MOM.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.576
- MM.
THERE'S A SAD PICTURE.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.662
AN UNMARRIED,
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

02:00.745 --> 02:03.581

WITH AN OLDER WOMAN ALL DAY.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.672
GO ON.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.215
- WELL, THIS IS
GONNA BE WONDERFUL

02:12.298 --> 02:15.343
FOR MY MOM TO SEE ME
BEING HONORED.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.220
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE WERE BOTH
IN SHOW BUSINESS,

02:17.303 --> 02:19.222
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
HER FAVORITE.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.598
- HOW'D YOUR SISTER
FEEL ABOUT THAT?

02:20.682 --> 02:23.685
- HUH, WELL, I NEVER
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

02:23.768 --> 02:25.228
BUT I'M SURE
IT WAS EXCITING FOR HER.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.105

NOW, I NEED YOU TO TRY
TO CONVINCE MY MOTHER

06:51.536 --> 06:53.454
THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED
ALL THAT STUFF.

WITH A GUEST ROOM FULL OF SHOES.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.459
- ALL RIGHT,
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

06:58.543 --> 07:01.379

TO BE REJECTED.

- YOU CAN'T THROW OUT
ALL MY TREASURES.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.178
- ALL RIGHT, WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE SENTIMENTAL.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.053
IF YOU WANNA GET RID
OF STUFF,

07:51.137 --> 07:53.181
YOU HAVE
TO GET BRUTAL,

07:53.264 --> 07:54.432
INCLUDING THIS THING.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.893

I EMPTIED ALL HIS ASHTRAYS,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.867
AND THE SMELL
REMINDS ME OF HIM.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.746
- NOW, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.249
OH, DADDY.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.876
- [sniffs]
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:21.959 --> 08:26.088
IT'S LIKE HE'S RIGHT HERE
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE CANADIANS.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.799
"WE'RE GUARDING
THE WRONG BORDER!"

08:31.636 --> 08:33.763

COULD GO.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.389

08:35.472 --> 08:36.765
THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
THAT YOU'D REGIFT

08:36.849 --> 08:38.267
TO SOMEONE
YOU DON'T LIKE.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.770
- YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.107
- AND YOU GAVE IT
TO ME.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.070
- LET'S GO GET
SOME GARBAGE B--UH--

08:49.153 --> 08:52.281
TREASURE BAGS.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.536
[door closes]
- [sighs]

09:09.882 --> 09:12.885
- WHAT?

09:12.969 --> 09:14.887

09:14.971 --> 09:17.515

09:23.938 --> 09:25.147

09:27.733 --> 09:29.318

09:29.402 --> 09:31.654

INTO COMING TO VISIT.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.697
AND IT WORKED.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.616
- WELL, NOW, SHE'S HERE.
NOW WHAT?

09:35.700 --> 09:39.161
- I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT THAT THROUGH.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.456
- YOU REALLY ARE
VICTORIA'S MOTHER.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.333
- WELL, NOW, I'VE GOTTA
FIGURE OUT A WAY

09:44.417 --> 09:47.169
TO GET HER TO STAY MORE
THAN JUST ONE NIGHT.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.672
[sighs]

09:49.755 --> 09:51.632
CAN I TRUST YOU
WITH MY SECRET?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.677
- ABSOLUTELY.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.307
IN FACT, I THINK
WE SHOULD HAVE SOME FUN.

10:00.891 --> 10:05.438
- WHAT?
- DIAL UP THE CRAZY.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.148
[laughs]

10:11.944 --> 10:15.239
- OH, NO.
I GOT THE DUD.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.743
- THE DUD
IS THE CUTEST ONE.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.871
I ALWAYS WANTED HIM.
I KNEW I COULD FIX HIM.

10:21.954 --> 10:26.083
OH, DEAR.
THAT WAS REVEALING.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.502
both: ♪ BUFFALO GIRLS,
WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT ♪

10:28.586 --> 10:30.129
- IS THAT SINGING?

10:30.212 --> 10:32.882
both: ♪ BUFFALO GIRLS,
WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT ♪

10:32.965 --> 10:36.260
♪ AND DANCE
BY THE LIGHT ♪

10:36.344 --> 10:40.848
♪ OF THE MOON ♪

10:42.767 --> 10:46.187
- OH, GIRLS!
ELKA IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.398
OH, ELKA,
WOULD YOU BE ON MY TV SHOW?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.901
- OH, I'D BE DELIGHTED.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.528
- AW, MOM, THEY STOPPED SHOOTING
YOUR SHOW 20 YEARS AGO.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.905
- OH, WILL YOU STOP IT?

10:55.988 --> 10:58.074
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE
THAT SECURITY GUARD

10:58.157 --> 11:01.535
OVER IN CHANNEL FOUR.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.037
OH, LOOK.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.707
IT'S JOHN LENNON
AND YOKO ONO.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.590
- OKAY, SO MAYBE WE HAVE
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.841
AH, BESS IS RIGHT.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.094
IT'S NOT JUST
THE MESSY HOUSE.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.096
MOM'S MIND IS GOING,
AND SHE NEEDS HELP.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.348
IT'S JUST--
I'M NOT GOOD AT THIS.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.225
- IT'S HARD.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.977
I MEAN, WE'RE AT AN AGE WHERE
OUR PARENTS NEED TO BE PARENTED.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.813
- I JUST THANK
MY LUCKY STARS

11:28.896 --> 11:30.898
MY MOTHER STILL SMOKES
LIKE A CHIMNEY.

11:30.981 --> 11:34.276
HER LUNGS WILL GO
LONG BEFORE HER BRAIN DOES.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.112
- WELL, MY PARENTS SIGNED UP
FOR ASSISTED LIVING.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.155
- ASSISTED LIVING?

11:38.239 --> 11:39.782
WHAT, THEY AGREED
TO BE HOOKED UP TO MACHINES

11:39.865 --> 11:42.618
FOR THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES?

11:48.040 --> 11:50.626
- NOT LIFE SUPPORT.
ASSISTED LIVING.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.295
THEY'RE FANCY
RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.589
- SO YOU'RE SAYING JUST THROW
MONEY AT THE PROBLEM?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.425
- I WOULD NEVER DO THAT--
- NO, NO, I LOVE IT.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.177
PROBLEM SOLVED.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.138
- UH, ELKA'S GOING
TO THE LIQUOR STORE.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.766
SHE SAYS THIS HOUSE IS
"CRIMINALLY UNDER-VODKA'D."

12:07.893 --> 12:09.353
AND DO YOU GUYS
NEED ANYTHING?

12:09.437 --> 12:10.813
- NO, NO THANKS.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.815
BESS, I'M READY
TO TALK ABOUT MOM.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.818
- OH, WE'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR PRIVACY.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.653
HEY, CAN WE TAKE
THE EASY BAKE OVEN?

12:17.736 --> 12:22.158
- OH, YOU DO KNOW THERE'S
A REAL OVEN IN THE KITCHEN?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.325
- YEAH, BUT IF IT DOESN'T
HAVE A LIGHT BULB IN IT,

12:23.409 --> 12:26.996
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.498
- [sighs]

12:29.582 --> 12:31.834
I'VE SOLVED IT.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.002
OKAY.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.253
I'M GONNA SET MOM UP

12:34.336 --> 12:36.881
IN ASSISTED LIVING
HERE IN CANOGA FALLS.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.466
AND--AND I'LL PAY
FOR EVERYTHING.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.676
AND, THAT WAY, YOU CAN STILL
LOOK IN ON HER EVERY DAY,

12:40.759 --> 12:42.178
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ALL THE HOARDING.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.096
AND IT'S A WIN-WIN.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.973
- NO, UH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.809
UM, THERE'S JUST
ONE LITTLE HICCUP.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.312
I WON'T ACTUALLY
BE HERE.

12:51.395 --> 12:55.524
UM, DO YOU REMEMBER CUTE
HANK DAWSON FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.860
- THE GUY
WITH THE LAZY EYE?

12:57.943 --> 12:58.944
- WELL, YEAH,
HE GOT THAT FIXED.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.072
BUT, UM, YEAH, WE FOUND
EACH OTHER ON THE INTERNET,

13:02.156 --> 13:03.699
AND WE--
WE REALLY HIT IT OFF.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.201
- OH, WELL, GREAT!

13:05.284 --> 13:07.203
SO NOW, YOU CAN SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HIM.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.246
- WELL, YEAH, THAT'S THE PLAN,
BUT HE'S IN ARIZONA.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.040
SO WE'RE GONNA BUY
A WINNEBAGO,

13:11.123 --> 13:12.708
AND WE'RE GONNA MOTOR-HOME
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.043
- WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.046
SO YOU'RE
QUITTING EVERYTHING

13:17.129 --> 13:21.342
TO GO TRAVEL
WITH SOME CROSS-EYED MAN?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.427
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE DOING SOMETHING

13:23.511 --> 13:25.346
SO DESPERATE
AND RIDICULOUS?

13:25.429 --> 13:27.389
- GEE, MAYBE I THOUGHT
YOU'D SAY SOMETHING SNIDE.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.933
- OH, PLEASE.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.518
NOW, I HAVE NEVER
BEEN ANYTHING

13:30.601 --> 13:33.437
BUT A SUPPORTIVE,
LOVING SISTER TO YOU,

13:33.521 --> 13:38.108
A CHIC, SOPHISTICATED ROLE MODEL
FOR YOU TO LOOK UP TO.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.196
- YOU KNOW, VICTORIA,
YOU KNOW,

13:42.279 --> 13:44.740
I FINALLY HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE,

13:44.823 --> 13:46.700
AND GET OUT
OF THIS TOWN,

13:46.784 --> 13:48.786
AND DO SOMETHING FUN
WITH MY LIFE.

13:48.869 --> 13:53.791
- OKAY, I-I-I UNDERSTAND THAT.

13:53.874 --> 13:57.127
BUT THERE'S NO ONE
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.755
I-I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE
THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.340
IT WOULD--IT WOULD BE
LIKE SWITCHING ROLES

14:01.423 --> 14:03.050
HALFWAY THROUGH A PLAY.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.970
- NOT EVERYBODY'S
IN YOUR PLAY.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.180
I'M IN MY OWN PLAY,

14:08.264 --> 14:10.933
AND I WANT IT
TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.811
- HEY, GIRLS!
WHAT'S THE BUZZ?

14:13.894 --> 14:17.106
- OH, GOD.
FORGOT ABOUT THE PUPPET DOOR.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.441
IT'S THE REASON
I NEVER HAD BOYS OVER.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.112
- BEST BIRTH CONTROL EVER.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.154
- HI.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.116
SO WHAT ARE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

14:27.199 --> 14:31.203
- OH, WE'RE JUST TALKING
ABOUT BESS AND HANK DAWSON.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.416
- "LAZY EYE" DAWSON?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.835
[chuckles]
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

14:37.918 --> 14:40.296
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE--WE--WE'VE RECONNECTED.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.300
AND WE'RE--
WE'RE GONNA GET A WINNEBAGO,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.968
AND WE'RE GONNA TRAVEL
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.761
AND THEN, I'M GONNA GO
TO ARIZONA

14:47.845 --> 14:49.805
AND LIVE WITH HIM.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.015
- WHAT?

14:51.098 --> 14:52.474
YOU LIVE WITH ME.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.852
- I KNOW, MOM.
- NO, NO, NO.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.312
YOU CAN'T
LEAVE ME, BESS.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.148
I-I-I'D BE LOST
WITHOUT YOU.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.650
I NEED YOU.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.986
- YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

15:04.069 --> 15:05.487
I GUESS I COULD--
I COULD TALK TO HANK--

15:05.571 --> 15:06.864
- MOM, NO.

15:06.947 --> 15:10.701
UM, BESS NEEDS
TO GO.

15:10.784 --> 15:14.038
AND BESIDES, IT'S--IT'S MY TURN
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.873
SO YOU'RE GONNA COME
TO CLEVELAND.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.333
AND I AM GONNA
SET YOU UP

15:17.416 --> 15:19.001
IN THE BEST ASSISTED LIVING
I CAN FIND.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.002
OH, IT'S GONNA
BE GREAT.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.088
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, MOM?
HUH?

15:26.592 --> 15:28.302
- SO SHE AGREED TO MOVE
TO CLEVELAND?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.220
- YES, AND I FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT IT.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.722
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

15:31.805 --> 15:33.724
'CAUSE MY BEST FRIEND
IS ONE OF THE BEST

15:33.807 --> 15:36.769
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY FINDERS
THERE IS.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.189
- I DID DO REALLY WELL
WITH MY PARENTS, DIDN'T I?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.399
HEY.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.484
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.152
- MM, WHAT SMELLS
SO GOOD?

15:45.235 --> 15:46.737
- MM, IT'S EASY BAKE CAKE.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.573
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WANTED
THAT CAKE AT MY WEDDING

15:49.657 --> 15:50.366
TO BOBBY SHERMAN.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.284
- MM.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.328
- FOR ME,
IT WAS ROD STEWART.

15:54.411 --> 15:57.706
I WAS SO MAD
I WAS TOO YOUNG FOR HIM.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.832
NOW, I'M TOO OLD
FOR HIM.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.835
[laughter]

16:01.919 --> 16:03.837
- HEY, TORI.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.923
I JUST WANNA THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU JUST DID.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.050
- HEY, WE BOTH KNOW
I WAS LONG OVERDUE

16:08.133 --> 16:09.885
TO HELP TAKE CARE
OF MOM.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.512
AND DON'T YOU WORRY.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.055
I WILL TAKE
EXCELLENT CARE OF HER.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.390
- WHERE IS SHE?

16:14.473 --> 16:17.976
- HUH, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS WITH YOU.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.232
- I WENT TOO FAR!

16:23.315 --> 16:26.068
THEY'RE GONNA SHOVE ME
IN A HOME!

16:31.990 --> 16:33.742
- THEY WANNA DRAG ME
OUT OF MY HOUSE,

16:33.826 --> 16:36.745
AND DUMP ME IN AN OLD FOLKS'
HOME IN CLEVELAND.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.456
- I TOLD YOU YOU WERE PLAYING
WITH FIRE.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.877
- YOU TOLD ME
TO DIAL UP THE CRAZY.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.631
- IN MY DEFENSE,
THAT CAN MEAN ANYTHING.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.633
- NOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO?

16:49.717 --> 16:53.262
I MEAN, I LOVE VICTORIA.
SHE'S MY LIGHT.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.391
BUT BESS...
BESS IS MY ROCK.

16:57.474 --> 17:00.978
- YOU HAVE
TO LET BESS GO.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.732
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET VICTORIA
BE THE ROCK FOR A CHANGE.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.778
[both laugh]

17:09.862 --> 17:11.155
I TRIED TO KEEP
A STRAIGHT FACE.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.115
I REALLY DID.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.284
- I MEAN,
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

17:15.367 --> 17:18.119
ME MOVING TO CLEVELAND
AT MY AGE.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.747
- WHY NOT?

17:19.829 --> 17:23.625
WHAT ARE YOU, 80?
- NOT YET.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.085
- YOU'RE A KID.

17:25.169 --> 17:30.174
TELL VICTORIA YOU WANT A CONDO
WITH A LAKE VIEW.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.634
- WELL, THAT MIGHT
BE OKAY.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.928
ONE QUESTION, THOUGH.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.306
HOW'S THE PUPPET SCENE
IN CLEVELAND?

17:37.389 --> 17:40.684
- I'M PROUD TO SAY
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.563
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT CRAZY IS:

17:44.646 --> 17:46.106
PRETENDING TO BE CRAZY
FOR MONTHS

17:46.190 --> 17:47.649
JUST TO GET VICTORIA
TO VISIT.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.567
WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST ASK HER?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.944
- I HAVE BEEN ASKING HER
FOR 12 YEARS.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.697
- NOW, NOW, CAN'T WE JUST STOP
WITH THE LIES?

17:53.781 --> 17:57.576
I'M 42 YEARS OLD.
I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE TRUTH.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.790
- UM...
[clears throat]

18:02.873 --> 18:05.375
ACTUALLY, THE TRUTH IS
BESS IS MOVING ON,

18:05.459 --> 18:08.170
AND I SHOULD TOO,
SO LOOK OUT, CLEVELAND.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.172
HERE I COME.
- OH, MOM, THAT IS GREAT.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.090
- YAY!
HAPPY FAMILY.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.467
LET'S HAVE TINY CAKE.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.969
- OOH.
WHAT FLAVOR IS IT?

18:16.053 --> 18:19.348
- HEY, THE FLAVOR IS
"FAR-OUT VANILLA."

18:19.431 --> 18:21.350
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.521
"BEST BEFORE 1986."

18:25.604 --> 18:27.731
- SO WERE YOU.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.370
- ELKA, I MAY
BE WRONG,

18:41.453 --> 18:46.041
BUT AREN'T THOSE GUYS OVER THERE
CHECKING US OUT?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.710
- YOU'RE NOT
IN CANOGA FALLS ANYMORE.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.879
THINGS MOVE A LITTLE FASTER
IN THE BIG CITY.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.881
- OH.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.521
NOT THAT FAST.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.858
- NICK, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

19:10.941 --> 19:13.569
- OH, I, UM--
I JUST WANTED TO COME OVER

19:13.652 --> 19:14.945
AND SAY "HELLO"
TO YOUR FRIEND...

19:15.028 --> 19:16.363
[chuckles]

19:16.446 --> 19:17.906
BUT I LOST
MY COURAGE.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.283
- [laughs]

19:19.366 --> 19:21.285
THIS IS
MY FRIEND PENNY.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.078
- UH-UH.
- PENNY, THIS IS NICK.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.371
- HELLO, NICK.
NICK, HAVE A SEAT.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.457
- OH, THANK YOU.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.424
- PENNY'S MOVING
TO CLEVELAND.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.925
- OHH...GREAT.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.386
- SHE MIGHT NEED SOMEONE
TO SHOW HER THE SIGHTS.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.930
- OH, YEAH.
SURE. GO-GOSH.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.766
YOU WOULD NEED A LOT OF...
[stammers]

19:44.850 --> 19:46.143
OH, YOU MEAN ME?

19:46.226 --> 19:47.769
UH-HUH?
OH, YEAH.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.062
I CAN DO THAT.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.732
- BUT, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING
TO BE WALKING,

19:51.815 --> 19:54.109
I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET TO SEE
ALL THE SIGHTS, BUT...

19:54.192 --> 19:55.736
- [laughs]

19:55.819 --> 20:00.449
- UH, WELL, YEAH, I-I'D LIKE YOU
TO SHOW ME AROUND.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.451
- WELL, I'VE GOT THINGS
TO DO.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.453
WHY DON'T YOU TWO
GET ACQUAINTED?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.413
- OH, ELKA.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.583
I AM SO GLAD
WE HAD THIS TIME TOGETHER.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.420
