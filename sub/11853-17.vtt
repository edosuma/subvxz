'cause it's almost harvest time.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.403
What's harvest time?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.038
Harvest is the time of year

02:52.105 --> 02:54.908
when fruits and vegetables
are ready for picking.

02:54.974 --> 02:58.912
Soon, we can pick these pumpkins
from their vines.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.947

03:49.295 --> 03:51.764
Sounds to me like fall is here!

03:51.831 --> 03:53.566
What's fall?

03:53.633 --> 03:55.335
Fall is a season.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.271
Fall is the time of year
that comes after summer.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.273
That's right, Nonny.

04:00.340 --> 04:03.810
And you know it's fall when
the weather starts to get chilly

04:03.876 --> 04:08.047
and the leaves change color
and fall off the trees.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.583
What else happens in the fall,
Mr. Grouper?

04:10.650 --> 04:13.019
Well, let's think about fall!

04:13.086 --> 04:16.656
When it's fall,
the color of the leaves change

04:16.723 --> 04:21.793
to orange, yellow, or--

04:21.861 --> 04:23.129
{\an3}Red!

04:23.196 --> 04:24.931
Red, right!

04:24.998 --> 04:29.135
And in the fall,
it starts to get colder.

04:29.202 --> 04:33.606
So, you might put on a--

04:33.673 --> 04:35.241
{\an3}Jacket!

04:35.308 --> 04:37.377
Jacket, that's right!

04:37.443 --> 04:40.546
And fall is also harvest time.

04:40.613 --> 04:45.952
Harvest is when we pick foods
like apples, cranberries and--

04:48.488 --> 04:50.156
{\an3}Pumpkins!

04:50.223 --> 04:54.293
Pumpkins, yes,
then we can make pumpkin pie!

07:05.358 --> 07:07.326
Hi, everybody!

07:07.393 --> 07:10.630
Setting the table before you eat
is a great way to be helpful.

07:10.696 --> 07:13.132

07:13.199 --> 07:15.535
What do we need
to set the table?

07:15.601 --> 07:19.872
To set a table, you'll need
a fork, knife, spoon

07:19.939 --> 07:21.274
and, of course, a napkin.

07:21.340 --> 07:23.676
The napkin goes on your lap,
right?

07:23.743 --> 07:25.411
It does when
you're ready to eat.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.880
But when you're setting a table,
the napkin goes right here,

07:27.947 --> 07:31.517
next to the plate!

07:31.584 --> 07:32.985
Whoa! That's great to know!

07:33.052 --> 07:36.055

knife, and the spoon?

"Arr", a giant pumpkin,
perfect for picking!

10:53.119 --> 10:54.987
This one would be perfect

10:55.054 --> 10:58.324
for turning into
a great big pumpkin pie!

10:58.391 --> 11:00.459
Oh, no!

11:00.526 --> 11:02.528
Yeah, delicious!

11:02.595 --> 11:04.263
{\an1}Yikes!

11:04.330 --> 11:07.800
Arr! Come back here, pumpkin!

11:07.867 --> 11:09.702
(Giggling)

11:09.769 --> 11:11.170
What are you making, Nonny?

11:11.237 --> 11:13.939
I'm tracing my hand
to make a turkey.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.708
Gobble-gobble.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.243
(Giggling)

11:17.309 --> 11:19.111
What are you drawing, Oona?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.846
It's a picture of a squirrel

11:20.913 --> 11:23.449
collecting acorns
for the winter.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.519
In the fall,
acorns fall from trees.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.921
Squirrels collect them
so they have something to eat

11:28.988 --> 11:30.956
during the winter.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.626
So they can party
all winter long!

11:33.692 --> 11:35.127
Party, party, par-tay!

11:35.194 --> 11:37.096
(Humming)

11:37.163 --> 11:41.867
{\an5}MR. GROUPER:
Okay, my little party squirrels,
It's time to go outside!

I'm a squirrel.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.126
I'm a squirrel too!

12:07.193 --> 12:09.829
Once upon a time,

12:09.895 --> 12:13.099
there were two squirrels
who lived in a tree.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.333
(Shivering)

12:14.400 --> 12:16.368
It's getting cold!

12:16.435 --> 12:19.271
It starts to get colder
in the fall.

12:19.338 --> 12:23.309
Yeah. We have to collect acorns
before it gets too cold.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.612
To the acorn truck!

12:30.983 --> 12:34.153
{\an5}GILLY:
So, the squirrels went out
to look for acorns.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.755
<i>Attention, squirrels!</i>

12:36.822 --> 12:39.925
<i>Please keep an eye out</i>
<i>for the Party Squirrel!</i>

12:39.992 --> 12:41.727
{\an3}Oh no!

12:41.794 --> 12:45.397
Party Squirrel,
he never wants to do any work.

12:45.464 --> 12:49.135
Yeah. He only wants to have fun.

12:49.201 --> 12:53.772
We'll keep an eye out for him!

12:53.839 --> 12:56.842
Acorns ahead!

12:56.909 --> 12:59.879
Let's load them up.

12:59.945 --> 13:04.817
{\an5}GILLY:
So, the squirrels loaded
the acorns into the truck.

13:04.884 --> 13:10.823
♪

13:10.890 --> 13:12.491
But just then--

13:12.558 --> 13:15.127
Hey! You squirrels
like to party?

13:15.194 --> 13:17.363
Party Squirrel!

13:17.429 --> 13:22.168
Oh yeah, Party Squirrel
in the house. What what?

13:22.234 --> 13:24.203
He made us drop our acorns.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.774
Check it out! Party Squirrel!
Hey-hey!

13:28.841 --> 13:33.179
We'd better go look
for acorns somewhere else.

13:33.245 --> 13:37.016
(Engine starting)

13:37.082 --> 13:40.586
{\an5}GILLY:
So, the squirrels went looking
for more acorns.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.355
Here are some more acorns
for the truck.

13:43.422 --> 13:48.360
Let's load them up!

13:50.563 --> 13:53.199
Look! The truck is almost full!

13:53.265 --> 13:55.067
We just need a few more!

13:55.134 --> 13:57.036
Hey, squirrel-friend!

13:57.102 --> 14:01.874
Question: What's got two thumbs
and likes to party?

14:01.941 --> 14:03.409
(Shrugging)

14:03.475 --> 14:06.679
Party Squirrel!

14:06.745 --> 14:08.614
Party, party, party!

14:08.681 --> 14:11.217
Oh no! What should we do now?

14:11.283 --> 14:15.754
Uhh, make like a tree
and "Leaf"?

14:15.821 --> 14:18.591
Makes sense to me!

14:18.657 --> 14:21.660
Party, party!

14:21.727 --> 14:23.729
(Thudding)

14:23.796 --> 14:26.799
(Noisemaker honking)

14:30.569 --> 14:35.507
Oh yeah, party time!

(Tires screeching)

14:48.320 --> 14:52.691
I think we finally lost him.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.094
We better hurry up
and get the last acorns

14:55.160 --> 14:56.962
before he comes back.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.498
Well, we only need a few more.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.767
Look!
There are some right there!

15:01.834 --> 15:05.671
PARTY SQUIRREL:
Squirrels just want to have fun!

15:05.738 --> 15:08.474
Oh no! Party Squirrel's coming!

15:08.540 --> 15:12.578
We need your help.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.848
We need to load enough acorns
before it gets too cold.

15:15.914 --> 15:19.985
When the acorns reach
the red line, say "Stop"!

15:20.052 --> 15:21.120
{\an1}Ready?

15:21.186 --> 15:26.125
{\an3}NONNY:
Ready.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.460
{\an6}Stop!

15:26.191 --> 15:28.460
That's enough!

15:28.527 --> 15:32.131
Yeah, now the truck is full.

15:32.197 --> 15:35.968
We did it. Let's get these
acorns back to our tree.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.573
{\an5}GILLY:
So, the squirrels brought
the acorns back to their tree,

15:41.640 --> 15:45.110
where it was safe and warm.

15:45.177 --> 15:48.414
Thank goodness we have all
the food we need right here,

15:48.480 --> 15:50.516
where it's safe and warm.

15:50.582 --> 15:53.352
Just in time, it's getting cold.

15:53.419 --> 15:57.156
(Sobbing)

15:57.222 --> 16:00.459
(Shivering)

16:00.526 --> 16:02.695
Why are you crying,
Party Squirrel?

16:02.761 --> 16:06.365
Because I didn't collect
any acorns.

16:06.432 --> 16:09.735
And now I'm cold and--
and hungry.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.604
(Sobbing)

16:12.671 --> 16:15.641
Hey, Party Squirrel,
who has two friends

16:15.708 --> 16:19.478
who are happy to help him
collect acorns?

16:19.545 --> 16:21.013
Party Squirrel?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.314
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.314
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.649
{\an3}Really?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.451
Yes, we'll drive the truck.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.120
But you have to work hard
to pick the acorns up.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.922
{\an3}No problem!

16:29.988 --> 16:33.759
