WEBVTT

00:12.679 --> 00:16.641
"Against other things,
it is possible to obtain security,

00:17.392 --> 00:18.727
but when it comes to death,

00:19.477 --> 00:23.148
we human beings
all live in an unwalled city."

00:24.482 --> 00:25.692
Do you know who said that?
Please, Lex.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.739
You don't have to do this.

00:31.156 --> 00:35.785
I'm doing this for us,
for the entire human race.

00:39.330 --> 00:40.623
Listen down below.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.718
They're already cheering.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.598
And it was Epicurus, by the way.

00:57.015 --> 01:02.312
An aphorism 230 years old,
and yet, still as apt as ever.

01:02.645 --> 01:06.399
You sound like a freshman philosophy major
and you're gonna kill millions of people.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.821
-The world can't live under a red sun.
-Neither can Superman.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.492
You see, sis, we as a people
have become soft.

01:16.117 --> 01:19.037
-And fat and stupid.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.957
<i>This is the Metropolis</i>
<i>Police Department. Surrender--</i>

01:27.128 --> 01:28.087
Where was I?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.131
My God, Lex. You killed them.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.927
Oh, that's right.
We must put faith in ourselves.

01:34.010 --> 01:38.181
But instead, we look up to him
with big glassy eyes,

01:38.264 --> 01:40.767
because we think he's invincible.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.896
It's my duty to dispel the world
of that notion.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.483
And when he dies,
they will finally wake up

01:48.900 --> 01:50.819
and see him for what he really was.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.947
A false god.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.283
At least he's a good man.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.786
He is not a man!

02:04.290 --> 02:06.918
I was the Man of Tomorrow! Not him!

02:07.293 --> 02:09.087
Not him!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.382
So, it was all ego then?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.342
No, it's science.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.346
I want to see
if the Kryptonian pretender can bleed.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.392
Even gods can die.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.435
- Go!
-You'll see.

02:25.687 --> 02:29.941
Everyone will see,
and then they're gonna thank me.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.478
A stroke, huh?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.523
You wanted to see me in person that badly?

03:13.985 --> 03:15.361
What can I say, sis?

03:17.071 --> 03:18.072
I missed you.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.219
James.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.513
Oh, my God. James?

03:42.931 --> 03:43.765
James?

03:53.691 --> 03:55.652
They call this a mercy furlough.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.821
Thank you, Officer. That'll be all.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.741
They never let me out of their sight.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.953
As if I'd run away like a dog
set loose from his leash.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.246
Well, you would.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.499
Of course I would. But I can't.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.584
I'm numb, top to bottom.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.045
My guts are in knots.
There's blood in my--

04:14.128 --> 04:16.089
Okay. That's enough.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.341
I'm dying.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.343
I know.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.847
That's it? You know?

04:26.182 --> 04:28.017
Well, you've only mentioned it
at the start and the end

04:28.101 --> 04:30.603
of every phone call
for the last six weeks.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.022
I'm not used to needing help.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.776
It's weak, pathetic. I'm pathetic.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.861
Your white blood cell count
has stabilized.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.154
You're not gonna die today.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.074
I won't die tomorrow either
if you finish the Harun-El serum.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.497
I'm not risking human lives
on an experimental, untested drug.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.376
What was the point of pulling strings
to get you DEO resources

04:53.459 --> 04:54.877
if not to test your drug on humans?
I didn't ask for that.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.464
And if Colonel Haley
knew you were behind it--

04:58.673 --> 05:00.425
She doesn't. No one does.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.093
Except for the person
whose strings you're pulling.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.679
But now I wonder if you didn't want
to just pull up a front row seat

05:04.762 --> 05:06.306
to watch me wither away and die.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.559
I'm not the one who accidentally
poisoned myself with Kryptonite

05:09.642 --> 05:11.561
in a quixotic attempt
to kill an invincible man.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.771
And while I do find the irony

05:13.855 --> 05:17.275
that you now need black Kryptonite
to cure yourself just delicious...

05:19.193 --> 05:20.945
You are my brother, Lex.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.947
I do want to save you.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.536
Besides, how can you pay your debt
to society if you're already dead?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.082
Mmm, now there's my sister.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.043
Lena, Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry to interrupt--

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
That's okay, honey.
I'll take a flat white.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.506
And you can call me "Lex."
It's easier to write on the cup.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.259
What is it, Eve?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.511
It's James.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.684
I know there's--

05:52.018 --> 05:52.977
Oh, God. Thank God you're okay.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.232
I heard what happened at CatCo,
and I wasn't sure--

05:58.316 --> 05:59.734
No one else was hurt, just James.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.695
-Is he all right?
-They're about to operate, but...

06:04.155 --> 06:07.909
His spine was badly injured.
We don't know what's gonna happen.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.036
Okay, where is he?

06:10.119 --> 06:12.997
He's upstairs, but they said
he can't have visitors yet.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.208
Well, I'm not a visitor.
I own this hospital.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.627
Little boxes, comrade.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.511
What exactly transpired?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.639
All I know is that he was shot
in his own office, from behind.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.850
They used a hollow-point bullet.
It splintered.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.269
Who would do something so horrible?

06:35.353 --> 06:38.064
Someone without a soul.
This has to be Manchester Black.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.899
At the march, he threatened me.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.319
He swore to come after me and my family,
everyone I care about.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.113
It seems he's started with James.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.364
We have to find him.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.698
Stay with James.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.495
He needs his friends right now.
I'll find Manchester. This ends today.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.964
Lena,
I'm so sorry this is happening.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.925
But you and I both know
the limitations of modern medicine.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.220
I mean, even best-case scenario
would leave James paralyzed.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.348
Your serum could heal him entirely.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.891
Or it could kill him.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.647
I can't summon a breakthrough
through sheer force of will.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.443
Then how is it that every time
I've seen you work under pressure,

07:23.526 --> 07:24.694
you've done exactly that?

07:25.445 --> 07:29.198
Lena, you have all of L-Corp
and you have the DEO at your disposal.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.868
I mean, there must be some resource
that you're not utilizing.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.750
Keep me updated.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.479
I found Manchester.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.647
He's done something terrible.
I can sense it.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.441
-I'm coming with you.
-All right.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.486
Hey. Where are you going?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.489
After Manchester Black.
He's the one responsible.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.741
Well, be safe. Kara and I
can hold down the fort.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.537
No, I have to go to CatCo.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.499
Now? James is your best friend.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.293
Well, he would want to know that
someone could be there if he couldn't.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.754
-What if something happens?
-I'll be back soon.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.302
What is this place?

08:31.385 --> 08:32.887
This is where my father died.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.102
-Supergirl!
-I'm on it!

08:54.367 --> 08:55.493
Hello, J'onn.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.041
How are you capable of this?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.461
When you broke into my mind to stop me
from killing the Lockwood brood,

09:06.295 --> 09:07.338
you opened up a motorway.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.798
It goes both ways.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.635
So, whenever you poke around in my mind,
I can poke around in yours.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.179
So I did. And looky what I found.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.265
Your people's most powerful weapon.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.225
You don't know what you're toying with.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.184
Oh, but I do.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.021
I dug deep into your mind and the ground.

09:24.397 --> 09:29.360
You call yourself a man of peace, Martian,
but your god was one of wrath!

09:29.694 --> 09:33.823
You burned my father's grave
to teach me a theology lesson?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.661
You forget H'ronmeer's Punishments.
You're a hypocrite.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.538
Wake up, man!

09:40.746 --> 09:43.958
It's time you followed
the true righteous path.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.544
And we can put a stop to the hate
that's burning this world up,

09:46.627 --> 09:47.795
just like it burned up Mars.

09:49.922 --> 09:50.965
We can stop it together.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.931
I heard everything. J'onn...

10:00.641 --> 10:02.351
What did he mean when
he said "the Punishments"?

10:08.566 --> 10:11.611
Have you ever noticed that her eyes
seem to follow you everywhere?

10:12.695 --> 10:13.529
Lex.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.324
Lex, it's worse than I thought.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.409
Okay? If we don't help him,
James is gonna die.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
Why do you even care about Jimmy?

10:21.537 --> 10:23.122
I thought you two broke up,
and good riddance.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.041
I pushed James away,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.293
because if he found out
about us working together,

10:27.376 --> 10:28.544
it would destroy our relationship.

10:32.256 --> 10:35.468
And now you're asking me
to work with you to save him.

10:35.551 --> 10:38.054
You're right. The irony is delicious.

10:38.512 --> 10:42.475
Help me fix the Harun-El,
and I can save both you and him.

10:43.684 --> 10:47.521
I haven't been able to separate the drug's
more curative properties from its...

10:49.649 --> 10:50.816
extra-normal ones.

10:51.692 --> 10:52.943
Super powers.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.530
Sounds less silly the more you say it.
Try it.

10:56.614 --> 11:00.576
Its super powers is what
makes this drug so lethal, okay?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.704
The powers need to be isolated
and dosed out.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.831
And you have more experience
working with Kryptonite

11:05.915 --> 11:09.543
in all its forms than anyone else,
so, please, help me.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.463
You trust me?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.926
Would you trust me if I did?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.348
But I need you.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.725
And that's enough.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.228
Lex and Lena Luthor.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.607
Teaming up to save Superman's best pal.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.275
What would Mother think?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.204
My dreams are failing me.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.706
I should have seen this coming.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.962
What good am I as a hero if I can't
even protect the people that I love?

11:53.629 --> 11:57.216
What about my powers of deduction?

11:58.634 --> 12:00.719
It should have been I that predicted this.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.349
A backlash always follows
a political success like the march.
And Manchester is still in possession
of my Legion ring.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.022
He could use it
to fly into CatCo undetected.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.692
I am to blame.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.073
Are you guys all right?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.408
Mr. Olsen is stable.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.035
We were able to remove
a significant amount of shrapnel

12:25.119 --> 12:26.203
from around his cervical vertebra,

12:26.662 --> 12:29.498
but I've never seen
a normal bullet cause this much damage.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.001
We've placed him
in a medically-induced coma.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.211
To reduce swelling. Of course.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.880
There are going to be
some decisions to make.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.006
Who is next of kin?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.634
Well, there's no family present,
but I can act as next of kin.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.677
We need a family member.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.972
Look, I'm FBI
and I have extensive medical training--

12:45.306 --> 12:47.308
-I'm sorry. Without a court order--
- I'm next of kin.

12:47.391 --> 12:51.270
Sorry. I just got off a red-eye.
I'm Kelly Olsen, James' sister.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.355
Did you say FBI?

12:53.939 --> 12:54.982
You're Kara's sister?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.901
Yeah. Alex.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
It's nice to finally meet you.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.947
I wish it was under better circumstances.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.367
I'd like to see James right away.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.577
Absolutely.

13:06.827 --> 13:10.372
And these people are family, too.
Make sure they have access.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.047
It really is a remarkable substance.

13:19.089 --> 13:22.259
-We started with mice.
-Sure, a super-primate.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.721
It's like you're running a lab
out of a Wikipedia handbook.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.097
No wonder you're so behind schedule.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.891
Are you gonna taunt
and provoke me the entire time?

13:30.100 --> 13:32.186
This is how we've worked together
ever since we were kids.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.479
You propose a theory,

13:33.562 --> 13:36.899
I tell you how wrong you are,
and it drives you to be better.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.567
And you call that working together?

13:40.110 --> 13:43.656
You're brilliant, and driven and defiant.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.618
Always were.
You just needed someone to defy.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.704
Wait. Are you actually taking credit
for my success?
You were always driven
to impress me. Always.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.044
If I would've given you an inch...

13:57.127 --> 13:59.296
If I would've thrown you a "good job"

13:59.630 --> 14:02.716
or cried out "That's wonderful"
every time you showed me one of your toys,

14:02.800 --> 14:05.135
do you think you would've been
as successful as you are--

14:10.933 --> 14:13.811
-That's unfortunate.
-We need some water in here.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.646
Lex, just breathe, okay?

14:16.397 --> 14:17.231
Thank you.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.109
He can lap it up like a dog.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.820
-How dare you.
-It's okay, sis.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.531
I'm used to it.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.701
I'm not very popular in prison.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.620
What I was trying to say is...

14:32.454 --> 14:35.916
You were wonderful.

14:37.501 --> 14:41.755
You always wowed me. Always.

14:42.756 --> 14:47.136
Look at you. You made Kryptonite.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.556
Even I couldn't do that.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.518
I'm proud of you.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.856
Let's get back to work.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.568
This sentimentality will kill me
faster than the cancer.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.533
H'ronmeer tested the Martian people
in many ways.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.745
And when they failed him,
they were punished.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.371
A god of wrath.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.208
We can't just track Manchester.
We'll have to find him another way.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.758
The Sacred Symbols.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.093
Your bible.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.931
Maybe they can tell us
what Manchester is planning to do next.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.935
The Symbols are full of tales
of H'ronmeer's vengeance.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.521
When he would use violence
to enforce a moral law.

15:41.398 --> 15:45.277
Manchester can use the Staff
to recreate the Punishments, one by one.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.784
All because I let him into my head.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.788
All to force me into violence.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.875
You told me yourself
you thought Manchester was a test.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.877
Don't let him bait you.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.421
Let's find him and let's stop him.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.423
Yes.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.178
Alex, it's me.
I'm just checking in on James.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.222
Call me back, okay?

16:14.765 --> 16:15.683
Eve, what's wrong?

16:17.726 --> 16:20.771
I understand you wanting to save
your dying brother, no matter what he did.

16:21.563 --> 16:25.651
But now we're giving him full access
to everything in order to save Mr. Olsen.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.279
I care about James, too.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.533
But I just want to make sure that
you're not gonna let your sympathy

16:32.616 --> 16:34.827
jeopardize everything that
you've been working toward.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.874
Eve, I know what my brother is capable of
more than anyone.

16:41.709 --> 16:45.045
But I truly believe his lone scheme
right now is just to live.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.340
I don't think he can imagine the world
without him in it.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.466
Okay?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.885
Come on, let's get back to work.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.644
-What's going on?
-He's making a mess of your floor.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.187
I'll have you arrested!

17:02.271 --> 17:05.190
Don't blame him.
He knows not what he does.

17:05.649 --> 17:07.651
-He's on a government salary, after all.
-Give me the keys.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.320
-You can't be serious--
-Give me the keys now!

17:10.654 --> 17:12.781
-It's your funeral, lady.
-Eve.

17:18.620 --> 17:19.747
How's he doing?

17:20.664 --> 17:24.835
Still unconscious, but that means
he's healing, so I'll take it.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.546
Thank you for giving us access.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.090
-James means the world to us.
-Of course.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.676
James has always been
more of a chosen family kind of guy.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.471
Speaking of, where is your sister?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.267
We need help in here!

17:41.852 --> 17:43.604
He's coding. Get them out.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.731
Pressure dropping.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.611
Bring in the crash cart.
He needs to be intubated.

17:58.827 --> 17:59.787
Your brother's bleeding internally.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.540
Surgery poses a great risk
to James' spinal cord,

18:03.624 --> 18:06.543
but if we don't operate,
he will continue to bleed out.

18:07.544 --> 18:09.129
-He might die?
-Correct.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.010
-Yeah, let's do the surgery.
-We'll prep him right away.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.474
There is another option.
It's a better one.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.392
Lena is working with the government

18:22.476 --> 18:25.312
on an experimental drug
that could heal James entirely.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.857
Okay. Why does that sound
too good to be true?

18:28.941 --> 18:31.485
Because it's not ready yet.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.028
But I spoke to her, and she said that

18:33.112 --> 18:35.447
she just needs a few more hours
to render the drug non-lethal.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.701
You're proposing that
we hold off on James' surgery,

18:39.785 --> 18:41.954
risking his life for hours,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.039
only to administer a drug
that might still kill him?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.874
The operation is gonna be invasive,

18:45.958 --> 18:48.460
and it's gonna be traumatic
to James' entire system.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.505
He will be lucky
if paralysis is his only aftereffect.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.298
You haven't seen Lena work.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.760
I have watched her
do incredible and impossible things.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.596
I understand that you trust this woman,
but I don't know her.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.307
All I know is that she and James
had a messy break-up

19:02.391 --> 19:05.477
and that her family
has done some terrible things,

19:05.561 --> 19:07.062
many of them to my brother.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.981
Those things have nothing to do with Lena.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.024
That doesn't mean I'm willing
to put my brother's life in her hands.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.860
I just want what's best for James.

19:14.069 --> 19:14.987
So do I.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.245
BPM is 92 and rising.
What was that tutor's name?

19:23.328 --> 19:25.164
-Krinick.
-Yes. Yes, that's right.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.331
Okay, injecting now.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.879
If I misquoted my Salutati...
124 and rising.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.173
She would make me stand in a corner

19:34.256 --> 19:37.259
and repeat "I do not like myself"
in perfect Latin.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.138
No wonder you became a sociopath.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.182
If the Latin fits...

19:43.265 --> 19:44.558
143 and rising.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.102
Pull back on the drip just a touch.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.188
-No, that's how we lost the last one.
-That was a tad, not a touch.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.773
-You call that scientific?
-Do you want this to succeed or not?

19:53.025 --> 19:53.901
Pulling back a touch.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.445
165.
162.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.491
-152.
-It's dropping.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.160
The tumor's reduced by half.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.080
-BPM's still a little high.
-No, the heart's still beating.

20:07.831 --> 20:08.790
We've almost got it.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.251
- <i>It's Alex.</i>

20:11.501 --> 20:14.004
-You should take that.
-Alex.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.673
-Is James okay?
- <i>No, Kara.</i>

20:16.757 --> 20:19.801
James' life is at stake,
and you left me here alone.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.803
And he's heading into surgery again.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.264
-What? Why?
<i>-He's bleeding internally.</i>

20:24.348 --> 20:26.767
And his sister
wanted the doctors to operate--

20:26.975 --> 20:29.186
Hang on. Kelly's there? What is happening?

20:29.269 --> 20:31.104
Well, you would know if you were here.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.024
<i>We all need you here, Kara.</i>

20:34.107 --> 20:37.069
He's headed into
a very dangerous operation,

20:37.152 --> 20:39.071
and you may never get to say goodbye.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.573
<i>And where are you exactly?</i>

20:41.657 --> 20:44.534
CatCo? Because, look, I called there,

20:44.993 --> 20:46.703
<i>and they said that</i>
<i>you haven't been there all day.</i>

20:47.162 --> 20:49.456
I'm helping J'onn with a lead.

20:49.748 --> 20:53.252
So, J'onn needs a reporter
to help fight Manchester Black?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.420
I mean, what are you gonna do exactly?
You're gonna interview him?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.632
-No, it's not--
-The operation's about to begin.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.010
I have to call Lena.
Good luck with your investigation.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.931
We were so close.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.643
At this point, it's 99% non-lethal.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.397
It doesn't matter now.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.234
James is in surgery.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.195
So, why are you still here?

21:22.155 --> 21:23.490
I can't help James now.

21:24.574 --> 21:30.289
Did I ever tell you about my dog Ignatius?

21:31.581 --> 21:34.584
Before you joined our family,
he was my closest companion.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.879
And when I was seven,
he had to be put down.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.549
If you're gonna continue
to compare James to your dying dog,

21:40.632 --> 21:42.301
I'm not sure I'm gonna
be amenable to your point.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.970
I wanted to be there for the procedure.

21:46.888 --> 21:51.852
But Mother insisted
that I go on a business trip with Father.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.982
She thought I was being too sentimental.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.319
-That's our mom.
-That's my mom.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.488
A trip with Father.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.826
That's sounds like something
that ordinarily would've pleased me.

22:07.909 --> 22:11.038
But on this particular trip,
he brought a woman with him,

22:12.414 --> 22:14.082
and insisted that
she go everywhere with us.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.171
So, here I was.

22:19.838 --> 22:22.382
Seven years old. Dog dying.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.719
-Father ignoring me.
-Is there a point to this story?

22:25.802 --> 22:28.472
At first, I swore to loathe this woman.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.893
How dare she take my father from me
at the moment I needed him most?

22:33.685 --> 22:37.606
But I couldn't keep my promise.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.319
Because she was wonderful.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.113
She was so kind to me.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.035
On the day they put Ignatius down,
she embraced me

22:51.328 --> 22:55.123
and sang me this beautiful Irish song.
By the end of the trip,
I wished that she was my mother.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.135
-But she wasn't your mother.
-She was yours.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.681
I want you to know with certainty.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.351
Though while I came from poison,

23:16.186 --> 23:17.562
you came from love.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.400
And if the rest of this family
stands steadily in darkness,

23:22.484 --> 23:25.862
you will always fall into the light.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.910
I knew that from the moment I met her.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.000
Jimmy needs you now, Lena.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.294
It's James.

23:44.422 --> 23:46.049
You can send the guard back in.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.535
J'onn.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.581
Kara, how is Alex...

24:19.082 --> 24:21.418
Dead, like me.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.547
You stood idly by, J'onn.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.841
You just sat there.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.634
And you waited.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.053
And you prayed.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.181
And you just sat there.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.184
While they came for us!

24:37.475 --> 24:38.602
You're not real.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.729
-We are.
-So real.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.772
Manchester, show yourself!

24:42.898 --> 24:44.566
We are the ones you couldn't save.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.610
Who you wouldn't save.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.445
Just like your own daughters!

24:48.570 --> 24:49.946
No! Alex!

24:50.947 --> 24:52.949
Kara! Alex!

24:53.867 --> 24:54.701
Kara!
No!

24:58.121 --> 25:00.040
J'onn? J'onn?

25:00.123 --> 25:02.417
J'onn! Hey! Hey, I'm here.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.586
It's me. You're okay. You're safe.

25:14.554 --> 25:19.017
Manchester was trying to show me what
could happen if I continue to sit idly by.

25:19.684 --> 25:24.022
I have left you and Alex alone
to face dangers.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.151
Is choosing the path of peace worth it

25:28.235 --> 25:31.529
if it means I could lose
everyone I care about?

25:33.531 --> 25:35.158
After what happened on Krypton,

25:36.368 --> 25:39.746
the way my mom stood by and did nothing,

25:40.956 --> 25:43.833
I've always sworn
that if I can act, I will.

25:43.917 --> 25:47.337
But until you took your vow of peace,
I didn't truly understand

25:48.255 --> 25:51.841
that simply by standing with someone,
you can make them feel braver.

25:54.594 --> 25:58.682
J'onn, the only reason Alex and I
can face danger the way we do

25:58.765 --> 26:00.767
is because we know you're standing by us.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.895
In whatever way you choose.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.482
Thank you.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.153
What should we do now?

26:12.404 --> 26:15.949
Well, clearly,
Manchester wants you to hunt him

26:16.032 --> 26:19.077
so he can exploit your psychic connection
and attack you.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.495
And we've just been
playing into his hands.

26:20.996 --> 26:25.625
So, maybe the best thing to do now
is let him come to us.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.839
It's a peace offering.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.678
I'm sorry about before. I was out of line.

26:38.263 --> 26:42.058
You care about James.
That's nothing to apologize for.

26:43.768 --> 26:44.602
But I will take it.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.563
Yes, thanks.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.607
Jell-O really is
the perfect hospital food.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.402
It's a metaphor for trauma.

26:53.695 --> 26:58.575
If you shake it, it wobbles,
but it still holds its form.

26:59.075 --> 27:01.786
If you dig in too deep,
it's never the same.

27:02.245 --> 27:06.875
You don't seem to be wobbling very much,
given the circumstances.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.627
-Military?
-Psychologist, yeah.

27:09.961 --> 27:10.795
Hmm.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.299
I have pretty much seen it all.

27:15.592 --> 27:20.722
Plus, this is the 12th time that
I have visited James in the hospital.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.098
-Wow.
-You know my brother.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.434
He's always running off
and diving into something dangerous.

27:25.518 --> 27:29.898
It was the way he coped
when things got hard at home.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.691
If you just keep running,
then you don't have to stop

27:31.775 --> 27:32.901
and feel how much you're hurting.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.861
That sounds familiar.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.988
-Kara. Hi.
-Hi.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.908
Oh, it's been forever.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.035
Sorry it took me so long to get here.

27:42.535 --> 27:44.913
-You were where you needed to be.
-I am now.

27:49.542 --> 27:52.837
I am going to go and find more snacks.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.173
-Yeah, I'll come with you.
-Okay.

27:55.256 --> 27:57.509
-J'onn, by the way.
-Oh! Cool name.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.052
-French?
- Close.

28:00.595 --> 28:01.554
So...

28:02.472 --> 28:03.973
-You came.
-I did.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.476
And I brought
a whole bunch of excuses with me.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.896
But, deep down, I think I just

28:11.648 --> 28:14.984
couldn't bear standing by, doing nothing.

28:16.653 --> 28:19.280
-It's scary feeling helpless.
-It's terrifying.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.784
-Yeah.
-But being here with you isn't nothing.

28:24.327 --> 28:25.537
It's everything.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.590
Kara, Alex. Where is he?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.593
-He's this way.
-Yeah, this way.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.678
Okay.
Are you okay?

28:48.309 --> 28:51.563
I would be better
if I could just get a Choco.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.484
I usually get along so well with machines.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.325
-He's gonna be okay.
-It's not just James.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.745
Only months ago, Supergirl nearly died.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.997
And don't even get me started
on the AI plague

29:09.080 --> 29:13.001
that has forced me to
just give up my entire existence!

29:13.084 --> 29:15.670
Have I mentioned that
every single one of my ancestors is evil?

29:16.004 --> 29:19.382
And Mon-El, well,
he was always a bit dismissive.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.093
Microaggressions are their own form
of trauma.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.430
I'm sorry.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.266
I think this event has forced me

29:28.349 --> 29:30.643
to process every difficult thing
I have ever experienced,

29:30.727 --> 29:32.562
and I still can't even get a Choco--

29:50.622 --> 29:51.664
Power surge?

29:57.629 --> 30:00.089
Manchester's at the dam.
It powers the whole city.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.425
-With the staff, he could wipe it out.
-Let's go.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.014
James. He's in the middle of surgery.

30:09.015 --> 30:11.017
-Where are the backup generators?
-They should be on by now.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.436
We can't finish without power.
He'll bleed out.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.357
Manchester!

30:18.733 --> 30:21.236
Well, well. It's about time.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.531
Come and get it, Martian of Peace.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.253
The dam's cracked.
It's gonna flood the whole city.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.546
Go. This war is mine.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.090
I picked the safe option.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.926
This isn't supposed to happen
when you pick the safe option.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.179
Kelly, look, no one could have predicted
that this was gonna happen.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.598
You made the best decision
that you could for your brother,

30:50.682 --> 30:53.268
and Lena's drug wasn't ready then,
but it's ready now.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.938
Look, I know you have 1,000 reasons
to not trust Lena Luthor,

30:57.021 --> 30:58.857
but I'm not asking you to trust her.

30:59.232 --> 31:01.067
I am asking that you trust me.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.445
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.531
Hi. Sorry. Didn't mean to eavesdrop.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.867
Nasty habit.
But I heard what you just said.

31:09.325 --> 31:13.162
-I brought the drug just in case.
-We have to find Lena. Now.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.135
Damn it.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.226
Stop this madness.
You'll kill thousands of innocent people.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.188
This world is already
tearing itself apart.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.525
If you want to stop that, don't fight me.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.735
Join me.

31:43.818 --> 31:44.777
Never.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.622
What I'm about to do
is absolutely illegal.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.790
Any witnesses will be considered
accessories to a crime.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.251
-Ms. Luthor--
-Leave now, before I fire you.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.058
If you don't stand up and fight,
you'll lose everything.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.226
Again.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.233
K'hym.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.235
T'ania.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.590
Run. Run!

32:55.640 --> 32:57.016
No! No!

33:33.261 --> 33:34.262
Hey.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.146
You're beautiful.

33:55.825 --> 33:56.743
J'onn.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.786
Where's Manchester?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.206
Let's go see James.

34:13.676 --> 34:16.012
I only got shot once.
You didn't have to come all this way.

34:16.095 --> 34:17.930
Ah. You never invite me to visit.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.348
How else was I gonna meet your friends?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.185
They're pretty great, by the way.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.354
One of them even saved your life.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.858
Yeah, about that. Thank you.

34:28.941 --> 34:30.068
I'm just glad you're okay.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.404
Besides, Supergirl was the one
that found you.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.489
You should be thanking her.

34:34.989 --> 34:35.823
Yeah.

34:43.414 --> 34:46.334
Oh. I know you just came back
from the dead,

34:46.584 --> 34:49.378
but you're about to wish that you didn't.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.130
Because I called Mom.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.466
I think that's our cue.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.802
No. She... Don't leave me alone, guys.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.178
-Good luck.
-You've been there for me.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.014
Hey, Mom.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.478
You should give that ring back to Brainy.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.106
He'll be happy to see it.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.108
I'm not ready to explain how I got it.

35:10.817 --> 35:12.485
James is okay...

35:12.568 --> 35:15.655
The whole city is okay because of you.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.366
Yeah, but at what cost?

35:19.242 --> 35:20.660
Manchester is dead.

35:21.536 --> 35:22.995
I know you're trying
to follow your father's code,

35:23.079 --> 35:26.666
but what happened today
doesn't change who you're trying to be.

35:26.749 --> 35:29.127
But I don't know who that is, Kara.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.632
One thing I do know...

35:36.592 --> 35:40.847
I am not a man of peace.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.521
-If I may--
-We don't need to talk about it.

35:48.604 --> 35:49.438
I must.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.983
Even if it hurts.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.443
A wise man once said,

35:54.986 --> 35:59.282
"Relationships based
on intense experiences never work."

35:59.699 --> 36:00.950
What are you...

36:02.243 --> 36:03.786
The wise man is Keanu Reeves.

36:03.953 --> 36:05.538
A truth teller if there ever was one.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.708
It pains me to say, you and I...

36:10.960 --> 36:13.212
We can never be together.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.510
-All right. Well, if Keanu Reeves says--
-Don't speak.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.637
It only makes this more difficult.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.358
Whatever you say, wildcat.

36:46.412 --> 36:50.625
You know, most bad kids burn ants
using a magnifying glass.

36:50.917 --> 36:51.918
But not you.

36:52.668 --> 36:57.381
No, you would build anthills
out of mud and twigs, to scale.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.301
It would take you hours, sometimes days.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.888
And then, you would trick the ants
into thinking they were going home.

37:04.347 --> 37:09.101
They would follow the maze you laid out
and walk right into an open flame.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.606
I'm sorry.
Exactly what are you accusing me of?

37:17.193 --> 37:20.279
The power in the hospital didn't go off
because of the attack on the dam.

37:20.363 --> 37:21.364
You did that.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.992
And I know because the L-Corp foundation
has its name

37:25.076 --> 37:28.496
on every scalpel, bench
and backup generator in the place.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.625
Quite the philanthropist you've become.

37:35.544 --> 37:38.089
There were children in that hospital, Lex.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.882
You took advantage
of the attack on the dam

37:39.966 --> 37:42.343
to kill the power
while James was on the operating table.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.679
You risked his life
and the lives of countless others

37:44.762 --> 37:46.597
just so I would be forced
to test the Harun-El.

37:52.728 --> 37:53.896
Oh, you figured it all out.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.441
Well, mostly. You missed one big thing.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.652
Yeah. The story about my mother.
It was just another lie to manipulate me.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.196
No. That was true.
That's what made it so effective.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.991
But I also had Jimmy shot.

38:06.033 --> 38:09.036
Unfortunately, that wasn't as effective
a cattle prod as I'd hoped.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.496
You are sick.

38:10.746 --> 38:13.499
Exactly. I'm dying.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.295
This horrible cancer is eating me up,

38:17.378 --> 38:20.631
and you are sitting pretty
on the very thing that could cure me.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.509
And you wouldn't even test it!

38:25.261 --> 38:28.639
God knows I'm not gonna test
an experimental lethal drug on myself.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.143
So, you needed a nudge and a test dummy.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.061
Well, it worked.

38:35.396 --> 38:38.858
James is gonna live and you're gonna rot.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.778
Because I will never,
never give you the cure.

38:46.615 --> 38:47.616
Take him away.

38:47.700 --> 38:50.995
Lena... Lena, Lena, I'm disappointed
that this is your reaction,

38:51.078 --> 38:52.121
but I'm not surprised.

38:52.371 --> 38:57.043
Which is why I had someone
give me the cure ten minutes ago.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.143
-You're dead.
-No. You're dead.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.269
No. No...

39:15.895 --> 39:16.937
No!

39:18.731 --> 39:19.940
Image inducers.

39:20.024 --> 39:23.736
I have to say, I was skeptical,
but they really do come in handy.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.738
Miss Tessmacher!

39:30.493 --> 39:31.327
Eve.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.037
Sorry, not sorry.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.791
-How long?
-Forever.

39:37.541 --> 39:38.709
It's nothing personal.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.214
Mayday, mayday, Individual 1 is--

39:45.966 --> 39:48.052
Mmm, that won't be necessary,
Miss Tessmacher.

39:48.344 --> 39:52.556
My sister may be happy to let me die,
but I have no intention of killing her.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.308
Are you sure about that, boss?

39:54.725 --> 39:57.812
She's a real smarty two-shoes.
It's like food in your teeth.

39:58.270 --> 40:01.315
You're gonna thank me one day.
Everyone will. I'm sure of it.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.364
Stay here and take care of her.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.200
Yes, Mr. Luthor.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.413
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

40:15.496 --> 40:16.539
Indeed.

40:38.477 --> 40:39.311
Ahhh!

41:19.977 --> 41:20.853
Supergirl.

41:23.647 --> 41:25.524
Nice to finally meet you.
