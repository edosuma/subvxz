00:04.551 --> 00:06.313
<i>Previously on</i>
I'm Dying Up Here...

00:06.393 --> 00:09.456
I really like your idea, Leslie.
The women in comedy thing.

00:09.556 --> 00:11.858
I had an interesting
conversation with CBS today.

00:11.958 --> 00:14.521
Girls Are Funny Too. <i>Freddie
wants to hear the formal pitch.</i>

00:14.601 --> 00:16.043
Well, what I want to know,
Nick, is where you've been

00:16.123 --> 00:17.344
the last three years.

00:17.444 --> 00:18.365
But let's ask the real question:

00:18.445 --> 00:20.227
How the fuck did you get Carson?

00:20.327 --> 00:22.909
It turns out that, unlike you,
I'm really fucking funny.

00:24.771 --> 00:26.973
You went all Pavlov's pussy
the other night at Canter's

00:27.054 --> 00:28.615
<i>every time Nick opened his mouth.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.497
Can't you ever try to be
just a little bit better

00:30.577 --> 00:32.418
than you were the day before? Ever?

00:32.499 --> 00:34.681
Bill, it's over. Go home.

00:34.781 --> 00:35.942
This is your room when we don't need it.

00:36.022 --> 00:37.604
<i>Hey, so, them girls out there,</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:39.106
<i>- they... they prostitutes?
- Models.</i>

00:39.186 --> 00:40.847
I'm not leaving until I cum!

00:40.947 --> 00:42.349
- Where's your bouncer?
- We don't have bouncers.

00:42.429 --> 00:43.730
We're an exclusive modeling...

00:43.830 --> 00:45.632
Agency? We passed three
blowjobs on the way here.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.334
Okay? The jig is up.

00:47.434 --> 00:49.336
- You're a comic, right?
- I just do the open mic.

00:49.436 --> 00:51.318
Just it's not a lot of...
yeah, not a lot of options.

00:51.398 --> 00:53.500
I got a place you can go up right now.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.723
Hi. My name is Ron.
And I'm an alcoholic?

00:58.365 --> 01:00.607
Eat up. We got to meet the
mattress guy in an hour.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.553
<i>- I got</i> The Tonight Show.
<i>- Mr. Beverly,</i>

01:06.653 --> 01:08.255
<i>we're coming back from
commercial in five.</i>

<i>Really? All right.</i>

01:22.028 --> 01:23.690
<i>Tell your face.</i>

01:28.275 --> 01:29.876
<i>Guys, Vietnam's

01:29.956 --> 01:31.978

01:32.078 --> 01:33.780
<i>Comedians are coming home...</i>

01:33.880 --> 01:34.781
<i>from Canada.</i>

01:36.443 --> 01:37.724
<i>I used to do a
lot of handyman work,</i>

01:37.804 --> 01:39.306
<i>growing up.</i>

01:39.406 --> 01:41.908
<i>Mostly because my dad
was in the business...</i>

01:42.008 --> 01:43.710
<i>of breaking shit.</i>

01:50.016 --> 01:51.998
<i>Well, what are
you doing in here?</i>

01:52.098 --> 01:54.221
<i>That hooker in the trunk
ain't gonna bury herself.</i>

01:59.666 --> 02:00.987
<i>All right, thank you, folks.</i>

02:01.067 --> 02:02.329
<i>You've been a...</i>

02:02.429 --> 02:03.470
<i>slightly above average crowd.</i>

02:19.125 --> 02:20.587
Everyone please keep it down.

02:20.687 --> 02:22.349
Last looks, please. Last looks.

02:22.449 --> 02:24.551
We're back in two.

02:34.741 --> 02:35.822
Please keep it down, people.

02:35.902 --> 02:37.524
We're back in two.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.005
We are back in two.

02:50.997 --> 02:52.659
You're gonna do great.

02:54.681 --> 02:56.743
Quiet on the set, please.

03:03.610 --> 03:05.612
I met Tom Jones in makeup.

03:08.575 --> 03:10.277
All these years I've watched at home,

03:10.377 --> 03:12.699
I always wondered who was
behind these curtains.

03:14.140 --> 03:16.323
Are you the great and powerful Oz?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.691
You got any courage on you?

03:24.791 --> 03:26.793
Shh.

03:28.515 --> 03:29.376
Shh.

03:31.838 --> 03:33.380
Welcome back.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.522
Now, because you seem like
such a great audience,

03:35.602 --> 03:38.225
we have someone really
special coming out:

03:38.325 --> 03:41.268
a young comic who's currently
appearing at Goldie's,

03:41.368 --> 03:44.151
located on our own Sunset Strip.

03:44.251 --> 03:47.474
Would you all please welcome
a very funny young man,

03:47.574 --> 03:48.915
Nick Beverly!

03:57.784 --> 03:59.406
Wow.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.648
Feels so good to be here.

04:01.748 --> 04:04.331
So, my girlfriend broke
up with me recently.

04:04.431 --> 04:06.973
Yep, just snuck out in
the middle of the night.

04:07.073 --> 04:10.096
<i>Either that or we were robbed
and they only took her stuff.</i>

04:12.279 --> 04:13.860
<i>It was probably time, though.</i>

04:13.960 --> 04:15.982
<i>Our love life... not so great.</i>

04:16.082 --> 04:17.784
<i>You know it's not good</i>

04:17.884 --> 04:20.146
<i>when your girlfriend
refers to sex with you</i>

04:20.245 --> 04:22.429
as "taking one for the team."

04:22.529 --> 04:24.311
<i>Yeah, hey, I wish there was a team.</i>

04:24.411 --> 04:27.434
<i>Means I'd still have
four girlfriends left.</i>

04:27.534 --> 04:29.816
<i>And my ex has already started
seeing someone else.</i>

04:29.896 --> 04:31.538
It's only been a month,
and already she's

04:31.618 --> 04:34.140
yelling at some other guy for
leaving wet towels on the floor,

04:34.220 --> 04:36.443
like my wet towels meant nothing.

04:38.305 --> 04:40.807
<i>It's sad, really. She
was my best friend.</i>

04:40.907 --> 04:43.630
<i>I mean, after she scared
all my real friends away.</i>

04:45.312 --> 04:47.774
<i>But I'm seeing someone now too.</i>

04:47.874 --> 04:50.577
You know, when her shades are up.

04:50.677 --> 04:53.300
No, it's not like that.
It's not like that.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.522
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
It's very innocent and sweet.

04:55.602 --> 04:57.904
<i>It's your typical... boy sees girl,</i>

04:58.004 --> 05:00.227
<i>girl sees boy seeing girl,</i>

05:00.327 --> 05:01.948
cops warn boy,

05:02.048 --> 05:04.751
boy has to stay 500 feet
from girl at all times...

05:04.851 --> 05:06.793
kind of story.

05:09.616 --> 05:13.320
Yep, a love as old as time.

05:40.847 --> 05:42.148
Hey.

05:42.248 --> 05:44.250
Hey.

06:02.068 --> 06:03.690
Did you see me tonight?

06:03.790 --> 06:05.652
Of course I saw you.

06:05.752 --> 06:08.134
And?

06:08.234 --> 06:10.957
You looked good. Real good.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.762
I didn't get the couch.

06:17.323 --> 06:19.025
Doesn't matter.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.907
We did Carson, baby.

06:21.007 --> 06:22.709
We're on our way.

06:22.809 --> 06:24.811
Yeah.

06:25.331 --> 06:26.873
Did you bring me any presents?

06:26.973 --> 06:28.975
Ohh.

06:46.192 --> 06:48.415
I could hear Johnny laughing.

06:52.118 --> 06:54.120
Probably just ran late.

06:57.604 --> 06:58.745
Are we gonna be rich now?

06:58.845 --> 07:00.967
'Cause I want to buy a real TV.

07:02.128 --> 07:04.130
So I can see you in color.

07:05.772 --> 07:08.695
Talked to a lot of people
making a lot of promises.

07:12.218 --> 07:14.941
Would've been nice
to get the couch, though.

07:19.345 --> 07:21.588
Do you think we could get a pool?

07:33.159 --> 07:36.022
Jesus, Arnie, we got to see that
first thing in the morning?

07:36.122 --> 07:38.705
Shouldn't there be a bulge or
something in the front of those?

07:38.805 --> 07:41.027
I mean, you look like a fucking G.I.
Joe doll down there.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.649
Oh, yeah? Why don't you
show me your tits?

07:42.729 --> 07:45.151
- I'll get a hard-on for you.
- Oh.

07:45.251 --> 07:46.953
You owe me eight bucks
for gas and water.

07:47.053 --> 07:48.114
I already paid.

07:48.214 --> 07:50.397
Talking to fuck-face.

07:50.497 --> 07:52.278
Uh, I'm a little light, Ensign.

07:52.378 --> 07:54.961
How about we barter, huh? Say
six boxes of Rice-A-Roni

07:55.061 --> 07:56.723
plus a nifty 50-cent piece?

07:56.823 --> 07:59.085
I still got four boxes left
over from the phone bill.

07:59.185 --> 08:00.286
I'll cover it, Arnie.

08:00.386 --> 08:01.808
Thanks, Eddie.

08:01.908 --> 08:03.690
You know, you're one lucky douche.

08:03.790 --> 08:06.072
You might want to think about
sticking a sock in there.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.194
Kind of looks like you're
being blown by a baby mouse.

08:08.274 --> 08:10.276
Fuck you.

08:12.478 --> 08:13.900
Hey, man. Sorry about that.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.782
I'm gonna get a job as soon as possible.

08:15.882 --> 08:17.504
I promise.

08:17.604 --> 08:20.947
You know, I could probably get
you a couple shifts at the deli.

08:21.047 --> 08:23.049
As soon as possible, within reason.

08:25.812 --> 08:27.814
You really are one lucky douche.

08:29.335 --> 08:30.977
<i>First of all,
and pardon my French,</i>

08:31.057 --> 08:34.320
but Fred has had a boner
for you for quite a while.

08:35.741 --> 08:38.124
First of all, that's not French,

08:38.224 --> 08:39.525
but I'll take the compliment.

08:39.626 --> 08:40.886
I can't wait to meet him.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.568
So, what are Fred's thoughts?

08:42.669 --> 08:46.012
We been tossing around
possible hosts, for starters.

08:46.112 --> 08:48.094
Totie Fields's name came up.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.776
Totie is wonderful,

08:49.876 --> 08:52.779
but isn't her health
kind of crap right now?

08:52.879 --> 08:54.380
What about Sally Struthers?

08:54.480 --> 08:57.183
<i>All in the Family</i> goes into
production in a month.

08:57.283 --> 08:59.305
Well, how about Cloris Leachman?

08:59.405 --> 09:01.187
She's got <i>Mary Tyler
Moore,</i> and there's...

09:01.287 --> 09:03.109
there's talk of a possible spin-off,

09:03.209 --> 09:05.171
so she's got a little too
much on her plate right now.

09:05.251 --> 09:07.914
Eh, she's a friend. I-I
could just give her a call.

09:12.579 --> 09:14.000
Can't hurt to ask.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.723
Great. Well, let's talk about talent.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.885
Now, this new kid, Elayne Boosler,

09:18.985 --> 09:20.607
funny as shit.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.368
Marsha Warfield,

09:22.468 --> 09:24.691
- she is hi-larious.
- Mm-hmm.

09:24.791 --> 09:27.694
Daphne Davis. She's got
something going on.

09:27.794 --> 09:30.497
And this kid. Karen Cozwell.

09:30.597 --> 09:32.859
She is a riot.

09:32.959 --> 09:36.583
Yeah, she's gonna break. Uh-uh,
you can trust me on that.

09:36.683 --> 09:39.506
Yeah, Boosler and Warfield...
I like them.

09:39.606 --> 09:41.027
Davis... they're all on our radar.

09:41.127 --> 09:42.989
I don't know about this one.

09:43.089 --> 09:44.350
You know, we'll have to vet her.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.072
They're all gems, Marty.

09:46.172 --> 09:47.774
They're handpicked by Goldie herself.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.397
And that means a lot. But,
uh, Fred has his process.

09:51.497 --> 09:54.521
Which is why CBS is sitting
on top of the ratings.

09:54.621 --> 09:58.244
I-I'm sure Goldie can arrange something.
Right, Goldie?

09:58.344 --> 10:00.166
Well, yeah. We got the, uh,

10:00.266 --> 10:01.848
Ladies Night in the Cellar.

10:01.948 --> 10:04.931
Why don't you come see a showcase, huh?

10:05.031 --> 10:07.033
Sure.

10:10.436 --> 10:13.339
- It's a little light.
- Light?

10:13.439 --> 10:15.542
Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey! Hey! Hey!

10:15.642 --> 10:17.744
Relax. I got money coming, man.

10:17.844 --> 10:19.546
Don't tell me to fucking relax.

10:19.646 --> 10:21.247
What? You think just 'cause
you and my cousin are tight

10:21.327 --> 10:23.049
I'm gonna sell you some
smack on fucking credit?

10:23.129 --> 10:24.851
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Give me a break, all right?

10:24.931 --> 10:26.432
Shit's tight right now.

10:26.532 --> 10:28.454
I spent all the money I got
trying to get set up out here.

10:28.534 --> 10:32.238
But I was on Carson last night.
Did you catch that?

10:32.338 --> 10:36.242
I don't care if you were on
the fucking moon last night.

10:36.342 --> 10:37.864
Yo, anyway, money's not
gonna be a problem.

10:37.944 --> 10:39.205
All right? Trust me.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.287
I ain't trusting no fucking junkie.

10:41.387 --> 10:43.449
I'm not a fucking junkie.

10:43.549 --> 10:47.333
No, not you. None of yous are.

10:47.433 --> 10:50.056
Tell you what. Why don't
you suck my dick,

10:50.156 --> 10:52.919
and I'll give you two bags? Fuck you.

10:58.004 --> 11:01.007
Usually "fuck you" is an exit line.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.113
I'll give you my leather.

11:07.213 --> 11:09.035
It's practically new.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.918
It's worth 80 bucks, all right?

11:12.018 --> 11:14.580
That's a gift from my mother.
Your fucking mother?

11:14.660 --> 11:15.842
Yeah.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.944
You're not a junkie.

11:25.471 --> 11:27.934
Hey, what's up, young brother?
How's the new digs treating you?

11:28.034 --> 11:31.137
Would've been nice if you told
me it was a fucking whorehouse.

11:31.237 --> 11:34.060
- It's not a whorehouse.
- Oh, yeah. Modeling agency.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.863
Look, I done got the
whole bullshit speech.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.845
Barton, I don't want to seem
unappreciative or nothing,

11:38.925 --> 11:41.587
but...

11:41.687 --> 11:43.730
I don't know if I want
to work for no pimp.

11:49.095 --> 11:50.436
You're something else,

11:50.536 --> 11:52.839
coming in here all hot.

11:52.939 --> 11:56.322
You know, my dad ran a jazz club

11:56.422 --> 11:58.284
on LA's Central Avenue.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.867
Some of the best talent in the
country came through that place.

12:00.947 --> 12:03.129
Packed houses every weekend.

12:03.229 --> 12:06.412
My daddy was so proud of that place.

12:06.512 --> 12:09.936
First hit of reefer I ever
took was with Charlie Parker.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.741
Now, white cops...

12:14.841 --> 12:17.143
they didn't like niggas getting ahead,

12:17.243 --> 12:20.026
so they started extorting money

12:20.126 --> 12:23.670
from my dad and all the other
black-owned businesses.

12:23.770 --> 12:25.952
You tried to resist, you
got hit with fines,

12:26.052 --> 12:29.195
restrictions, fire code violations,

12:29.295 --> 12:30.957
or worse.

12:31.057 --> 12:33.680
Then they brought Willie
Parker in to clean shit up.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.842
And he did...

12:35.942 --> 12:38.404
for white people.

12:38.504 --> 12:40.506
He called us monkeys.

12:41.988 --> 12:43.649
After a while,

12:43.749 --> 12:47.694
all the legitimate
businesses like my dad's?

12:47.794 --> 12:50.576
They just went away.

12:50.676 --> 12:53.219
Now, you tell me what's
left for a black man.

12:53.319 --> 12:54.901
Let me guess. Prostitution?

12:55.001 --> 12:57.824
Son, you knock on the front
door till your knuckles bloody,

12:57.924 --> 12:59.465
and nobody opens?

12:59.565 --> 13:02.188
Eventually, you slip around the
back and you pick the lock.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.521
Know your history, boy,

13:15.621 --> 13:18.604
next time you want to
talk shit to a man.

13:42.288 --> 13:44.310
<i>Hello?</i>

13:44.410 --> 13:46.412
<i>I'm looking for Nick Beverly.</i>

13:47.854 --> 13:49.856
<i>Hello?</i>

13:51.257 --> 13:53.119
Nick?

13:53.219 --> 13:54.761
No. This is Teddy King.

13:54.861 --> 13:56.903
I-I'm-I'm-I'm wanting to speak to Nick.

13:59.025 --> 14:01.027
<i>Is he there?</i>

14:10.877 --> 14:12.138
Good news, ladies.

14:12.238 --> 14:13.699
We got our own cigarettes.

14:13.799 --> 14:15.021
Yeah.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.143
Thank you, Virginia Slims.

14:17.243 --> 14:19.585
Equal rights? No.

14:19.685 --> 14:21.988
Equal wages? Not a chance.

14:22.088 --> 14:24.590
But equal chances of
getting lung cancer?

14:24.690 --> 14:26.352
After you, madam!

14:27.773 --> 14:29.755
All right, I'm 27 and single,

14:29.855 --> 14:31.417
and I think part of the
reason for this is

14:31.497 --> 14:33.599
because I had a really tough childhood.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.761
Both of my parents died when I was ten.

14:35.861 --> 14:37.403
- Aww.
- Thank you.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.926
It's okay, really. They
died in their sleep.

14:40.026 --> 14:42.068
They just happened to be behind
the wheel of a car at the time.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.572
It's really hard not having role models.

14:46.672 --> 14:48.774
You need someone to teach
you how stuff works,

14:48.874 --> 14:50.496
like relationships

14:50.596 --> 14:51.777
or seatbelts.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.662
Hey, I like that new stuff you doing.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.584
Why, thank you, kind sir.

14:58.684 --> 15:00.386
What you doing tomorrow night?

15:00.486 --> 15:02.909
- Eating over the sink. Why?
- I need a favor.

15:03.009 --> 15:05.591
Oh, who doesn't love
a compliment with a caveat?

15:05.691 --> 15:08.234
No, no, no, no. This is a...
this a good favor.

15:08.334 --> 15:10.236
I got this industrial tomorrow night

15:10.336 --> 15:12.038
for a bunch of TWA execs.

15:12.138 --> 15:13.639
Sonny and Cher got me tied up,

15:13.739 --> 15:15.421
so it would really help
me out if you'd do it.

15:15.501 --> 15:17.803
Super easy. I'ma give
you a list of names

15:17.903 --> 15:19.085
of dudes you can bust on.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.007
They love it.

15:21.107 --> 15:23.369
I don't know. I've never
done an industrial before.

15:23.469 --> 15:25.371
Two hundred cash for 30 minutes.

15:25.471 --> 15:26.732
Next time, lead with that.

15:28.034 --> 15:30.396
Good-looking crowd tonight.
Thanks for being here.

15:30.476 --> 15:32.778
Hi. My name's Ron, and
I am an alcoholic.

15:32.878 --> 15:34.140
Hi, Ron.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.942
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Th-thank you. Hi.

15:36.042 --> 15:38.504
Um, so, my mother was a big woman.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.546
I mean, a very big woman.

15:40.646 --> 15:41.868
I actually tried to get her

15:41.968 --> 15:43.669
to come here to this meeting tonight,

15:43.769 --> 15:46.792
but she refused when she
heard there were 12 steps.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.077
What else about drinking?

15:51.177 --> 15:53.799
Uh, I-I-I think my mother
being so heavy is-is actually

15:53.899 --> 15:55.581
the reason that I started
drinking to begin with,

15:55.661 --> 15:59.365
because basically anything
solid in the house, she ate,

15:59.465 --> 16:01.327
so all that were left were liquids.

16:03.469 --> 16:05.651
Uh, one time, back home in Tennessee...

16:05.751 --> 16:07.373
this is a true story...

16:07.473 --> 16:10.376
I saw my mother get trapped
outside during a tornado.

16:10.476 --> 16:12.378
The woman did not budge.

16:12.478 --> 16:15.641
I mean, honestly, it-it was like
watching God run out of breath.

16:18.924 --> 16:20.146
Why?

16:21.487 --> 16:22.588
Why can't I move...

16:23.689 --> 16:25.351
this cow?

16:28.454 --> 16:29.875
Um,

16:29.975 --> 16:31.557
yeah, but-but, you know, I kid.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.279
I lo-I love my mother. Uh, what else?

16:36.342 --> 16:37.723
Waitressing is so different

16:37.823 --> 16:39.765
from that <i>Let's Make a Deal</i> freak show.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.367
So glad to be out of there.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.229
I was a contestant on
<i>The Dating Game</i> once.

16:43.309 --> 16:45.691
Didn't get picked, but still
walked away with 50 bucks

16:45.791 --> 16:47.093
and a salon-style hairdryer.

16:47.193 --> 16:48.734
Mmm!

16:48.834 --> 16:51.097
- What are you doing there?
- Booth of high rollers.

16:51.197 --> 16:53.539
Show a little boob.
It'll bump up your tip.

16:53.639 --> 16:54.840
Oh. What's the boob-to-tip ratio here?

16:54.920 --> 16:56.362
Minimum cleavage for the riff-raff...

16:56.442 --> 16:57.383
- Mm-hmm.
- two buttons

16:57.483 --> 16:59.225
for a bachelor party,

16:59.325 --> 17:00.766
three buttons and the tip of a nip

17:00.846 --> 17:02.348
for anyone wearing Pierre Cardin.

17:02.448 --> 17:03.669
Ka-ching!

17:03.769 --> 17:05.171
If they're wearing Pierre Cardin,

17:05.251 --> 17:06.571
I'll just go ahead and show my whole...

17:06.652 --> 17:08.214
I'm just saying he didn't get the couch.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.974
No, no-no, they went long.
Joan Embery brought an ocelot

17:10.056 --> 17:11.277
and a woolly monkey.

17:11.377 --> 17:12.897
Wild animals suck at
keeping a tight five.

17:12.978 --> 17:14.880
- That's true.
- It could've been worse, right?

17:14.980 --> 17:16.561
Imagine Helen Reddy is subbing.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.663
- Mm.
- Helen Reddy subbing

17:17.742 --> 17:19.204
and not getting the couch?

17:19.305 --> 17:20.846
I mean, that'd be like, I don't know,

17:20.945 --> 17:23.809
fucking not getting laid at
the VFW after last call.

17:23.909 --> 17:26.132
- That happens.
- Don't let me stop you, please.

17:26.232 --> 17:28.754
Go on shitting on Nick's
killing it on Carson.

17:30.596 --> 17:33.379
Sully, I need you tomorrow in the
Cellar to emcee Ladies Night

17:33.479 --> 17:34.960
for the <i>Girls Are Funny, Too</i> producers.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.822
Shit, uh, I would.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.824
Um, I have sales calls until late.

17:38.924 --> 17:40.146
I can do it. Right?

17:40.246 --> 17:43.189
I could do that pelvic
exam chunk up front?

17:43.289 --> 17:44.830
Okay, Manny, you're in.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.953
Just "Welcome, ladies and germs"
will be sufficient, though.

17:48.053 --> 17:50.956
Oh, and while we're talking
about Nick, little heads up.

17:51.056 --> 17:54.160
He's gonna get double spots
Thursday through Sunday.

17:54.260 --> 17:55.581
Anybody got a problem with that,

17:55.661 --> 17:58.244
you can take it to the Ice House.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.346
As you were, ladies.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.569
Fucking double spots.
You believe this shit?

18:03.669 --> 18:05.091
She going with the hot hand.

18:05.191 --> 18:07.093
She would never give a
Mexican double spots.

18:07.193 --> 18:08.894
Puerto Rican? Maybe.

18:08.994 --> 18:10.336
Mexican? No way, José.

18:10.436 --> 18:12.538
Relax, Cantinflas.

18:12.638 --> 18:15.021
It's not a conspiracy. You're
Mexican, Puerto Rican...

18:15.121 --> 18:16.342
either way, it's just jokes

18:16.442 --> 18:18.624
about different street fair foods.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.446
I'm getting so fucking
sick of this place.

18:20.526 --> 18:22.348
I'd trade you, man. I have an 8 a.m.
sales call

18:22.448 --> 18:23.809
tomorrow in fucking Torrance.

18:23.889 --> 18:25.511
Boo-hoo. I do electrical work.

18:25.611 --> 18:26.732
Ralph writes for Sonny and Cher,

18:26.812 --> 18:28.194
and Edgar deals drugs.

18:28.294 --> 18:30.436
I consider myself a
freelance pharmacist.

18:30.536 --> 18:32.278
Okay. We all have day jobs.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.799
No, no, no, Bill. You have a day job.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.281
I have a day and a night job,

18:35.381 --> 18:36.782
'cause I got the work, I got the kid,

18:36.862 --> 18:38.764
and I've got all of here, don't I?

18:38.864 --> 18:40.286
Don't you sell auto parts?

18:40.386 --> 18:41.767
What?

18:41.867 --> 18:42.988
You know, you try getting
some guy worked up

18:43.068 --> 18:44.630
about buying your crescent wrench

18:44.710 --> 18:45.831
over some other asshole's,
and see if it's easy.

18:45.911 --> 18:47.293
That is true.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.135
Well, okay.

18:49.235 --> 18:50.496
Yeah. Pick me up at 7 a.m.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.378
Seriously? You're gonna
go on sales calls?

18:52.478 --> 18:54.060
Yeah. Why not?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.481
Be good to get the fuck
out of this shithole,

18:55.561 --> 18:56.942
even if it's only for a day.

18:57.042 --> 18:59.024
- Let's do it.
- All right. I'm in.

19:05.971 --> 19:07.673
Guy in booth three wanted your number.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.595
I told him I was not your secretary,

19:09.695 --> 19:11.537
and that he'd just have to look
it up on the men's room stall

19:11.617 --> 19:13.359
like everybody else.

19:13.459 --> 19:15.881
Fuck off, Lovis.

19:15.981 --> 19:18.284
You're gonna find yourself
saying that a lot.

19:18.384 --> 19:20.366
"Fuck off, Lovis."

19:20.466 --> 19:21.887
- How hot?
- Look, dude,

19:21.987 --> 19:24.290
the two hottest alcoholics
you've ever seen, okay?

19:24.390 --> 19:26.352
I can't speak for their livers,
but their bodies? Both tens.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.354
Okay, so, other than them
falling off the wagon

19:28.434 --> 19:30.115
and passing out before
us ordering the meal,

19:30.196 --> 19:31.837
how exactly are we gonna
pay for this double date?

19:31.917 --> 19:34.240
Why do you always got
to get so hung up on details?

19:34.320 --> 19:36.542
It's not details. It's fucking money.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.763
Wh-what if the restaurant doesn't take

19:37.843 --> 19:39.305
boxes of Rice-A-Roni in trade?

19:39.405 --> 19:40.626
Then what?

19:40.726 --> 19:41.927
All right, you know what, Eddie?

19:42.007 --> 19:43.869
I need a win, okay?

19:43.969 --> 19:45.311
No. You need a job.

19:45.411 --> 19:47.873
When have I ever asked you for anything?

19:47.973 --> 19:49.715
- Uh...
- That was fucking rhetorical.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.597
All right, listen, man.

19:51.697 --> 19:53.839
I'm saving my tips for a
rainy day, all right?

19:53.939 --> 19:55.861
The literal rainy day
when Arnie kicks us out

19:55.941 --> 19:59.125
for not making rent, and it's raining.

19:59.225 --> 20:00.966
Look. The girls like this place...

20:01.066 --> 20:02.408
- Oh, man.
- called Big Wally's

20:02.508 --> 20:04.049
House of Sizzle on Pico.

20:04.149 --> 20:05.811
It's cheap. I checked it out.
It's cheap.

20:05.911 --> 20:08.053
It's, you know, fish and
chips and hamburgers.

20:08.153 --> 20:10.155
Everything's about three bucks.
They don't even drink.

20:10.236 --> 20:11.437
So, I figure we're in,
for the whole shebang,

20:11.517 --> 20:13.219
like 20 bucks with tip.

20:13.319 --> 20:15.821
You know, right now our whole
shebang is about 40 bucks.

20:15.921 --> 20:18.043
Why can't we just take them
for a nice ice cream cone

20:18.123 --> 20:19.945
or go for a nice stroll?

20:20.045 --> 20:21.587
A stroll?

20:21.687 --> 20:23.108
I'm trying to get laid,

20:23.208 --> 20:26.272
not pose for a fucking
Rockwell painting, man.

20:26.372 --> 20:28.254
Is this about Cassie?
Is that what this is?

20:28.334 --> 20:29.875
- What?
- 'Cause you know what?

20:29.975 --> 20:31.817
For the first time, this
isn't about your dick.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.320
This is about my dick. My dick!

20:34.420 --> 20:38.764
You hear me, Eddie? The my... my dick!

20:39.945 --> 20:41.947
Hm.

20:43.429 --> 20:45.771
What? Just fucking say it.

20:45.871 --> 20:48.754
Oh, you just remind me
so much of your mother.

20:56.802 --> 21:01.347
What up, Cellar dweller?
How you liking it?

21:01.447 --> 21:03.108
Beats open mic. I can tell you that.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.210
Fucking jury duty better than open mic.

21:06.492 --> 21:09.154
I haven't seen Carl in a while.

21:09.254 --> 21:10.516
Yeah. I had to let him go.

21:10.616 --> 21:12.758
He was trying to box me up and shit.

21:12.858 --> 21:14.600
Man, this whole town
trying to box you up.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.323
Managers, Goldie, LAPD.

21:19.264 --> 21:21.647
Where you staying now?

21:21.747 --> 21:24.490
Weren't you living at Carl's?

21:24.590 --> 21:27.453
Yeah, I found a place. It's temporary.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.635
Yeah? Where?

21:31.637 --> 21:32.938
Why do I get that feeling

21:33.038 --> 21:35.100
you already know the
answer to that question?

21:35.200 --> 21:38.103
Look. It's none of my
business who you hang with,

21:38.203 --> 21:40.185
but Barton Royce?

21:40.285 --> 21:42.868
Nothing good gonna come out of that.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.949
What, you know Barton?

21:44.049 --> 21:46.992
I know a hundred Bartons.

21:47.092 --> 21:48.914
Look, man. All I know
is that I was sleeping

21:49.014 --> 21:51.557
in a abandoned Rambler for a week

21:51.657 --> 21:53.118
before he gave me a roof, so...

21:53.218 --> 21:54.960
I get it. The man did you a solid.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.642
It's cool.

21:56.742 --> 21:58.444
I'm just looking out for you.

21:58.544 --> 22:00.546
Just checking in.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.529
Them whores feeding you?

22:04.670 --> 22:06.171
- Models.
- Models.

22:08.113 --> 22:10.656
Look. How about you come to my house,

22:10.756 --> 22:12.418
I cook you some real food,

22:12.518 --> 22:14.940
and we can put some meat on
these motherfucking bones?

22:15.040 --> 22:16.742
You dig?

22:16.842 --> 22:17.663
I dig.

22:17.763 --> 22:19.765
All right.

22:34.339 --> 22:36.041
Is that your <i>Midnight Special</i> shirt?

22:36.141 --> 22:38.003
Yeah. Paid 30 bucks for it.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.745
Might as well get some
use out of it, you know?

22:39.825 --> 22:41.126
What are you doing?

22:41.226 --> 22:45.611
It's 7:30. Just having a little...

22:45.711 --> 22:47.052
cockadoodle-doobie.

22:47.152 --> 22:49.174
This sales call's in 15 minutes.

22:49.274 --> 22:51.176
We are right outside the place.

22:51.276 --> 22:53.939
That's all the more
reason to loosen up, man.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.501
Look at you.

22:55.601 --> 22:56.882
This outfit. Look at your fucking face.

22:56.962 --> 22:58.424
What's wrong with it?

22:58.524 --> 23:00.045
You look like you're
trying to take a shit

23:00.125 --> 23:01.887
after winning a grilled
cheese eating competition.

23:01.967 --> 23:03.268
Ugh.

23:03.368 --> 23:04.249
You got to loosen up.

23:04.329 --> 23:05.871
- No.
- Come on.

23:05.971 --> 23:07.232
Come on.

23:07.332 --> 23:09.234
- Aah!
- Yes!

23:09.334 --> 23:10.676
Yes.

23:10.776 --> 23:12.197
Mm-hmm.

23:12.297 --> 23:13.158
Mm-hmm!

23:14.379 --> 23:15.801
Yeah, buddy.

23:15.901 --> 23:18.263
Let's sell some car parts, motherfucker!

23:20.866 --> 23:23.489
Hey, hon. <i>Bonanza's</i> cancelled.

23:23.589 --> 23:25.571
Good news is

23:25.671 --> 23:28.013
now Lorne Green can devote
full time to his singing.

23:28.113 --> 23:30.055
I wanted to talk to you

23:30.155 --> 23:32.097
- about <i>Girls Are Funny, Too.</i>
- So, talk.

23:32.197 --> 23:33.579
I hear you're doing a showcase.

23:33.679 --> 23:34.660
I'd like to go up.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.141
Now don't talk.

23:36.241 --> 23:38.143
Just so there's no confusion,

23:38.243 --> 23:39.665
we've already picked our girls.

23:39.765 --> 23:41.827
Yeah, right, of course. I just...

23:41.927 --> 23:44.109
Cass, your material's getting there.

23:44.209 --> 23:46.231
People are noticing. I'm noticing.

23:46.331 --> 23:49.995
It's all the more reason
to take your time.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.757
- Hmm?
- Can I go up anyway?

23:51.857 --> 23:54.840
I mean, exposure's exposure, right?

23:54.940 --> 23:57.963
Sweetie, people die from
exposure all the time.

23:58.063 --> 23:59.565
You go up, they don't like your ten,

23:59.665 --> 24:02.007
who knows when you'll
see daylight again?

24:02.107 --> 24:04.009
Be smart. Wait.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.651
And when the time comes,

24:05.751 --> 24:08.934
we blow them the fuck away.

24:09.034 --> 24:12.458
Gus, I'm not saying it's the
only cylinder bolt set.

24:12.558 --> 24:14.259
I'm saying it's the best.

24:14.359 --> 24:18.464
Now, watch how that opening
slides onto that shaft

24:18.564 --> 24:19.945
just like God intended.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.710
- How horny is God, huh?
- What?

24:24.810 --> 24:26.792
Birds do it. Bees do it. I get it.

24:26.892 --> 24:28.514
But cylinder bolt sets?

24:28.614 --> 24:30.796
It's like God's always getting it on.

24:30.896 --> 24:34.239
Your desk lamp, there. You
<i>screw</i> in your light bulb.

24:34.339 --> 24:35.881
Everything's sex with him.

24:35.981 --> 24:37.683
Seriously, God, if it's
not too much to ask,

24:37.783 --> 24:39.585
how about pulling up your pants
and giving war and famine

24:39.665 --> 24:41.046
a little attention?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.928
Here's an idea. You want to spill seed?

24:43.028 --> 24:44.490
Ethiopia.

24:44.590 --> 24:47.052
Huh, I must say that's a
hell of a sales tactic.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.514
- Yep.
- Come in here and blaspheme.

24:48.594 --> 24:49.955
No, he's a little bit unorthodox.

24:50.035 --> 24:51.617
Downright rude's what he is.

24:51.717 --> 24:54.379
Am I wrong? I mean, if God
wanted us to make babies,

24:54.479 --> 24:56.441
he didn't have to get the penis
and the vagina involved.

24:56.522 --> 24:58.824
We could've easily just stuck
our finger in a girl's ear,

24:58.924 --> 25:00.385
but nope... he had to get little God

25:00.485 --> 25:01.767
to do all the thinking for him.

25:01.847 --> 25:04.710
Gus, he's been hit by
lightning four times.

25:04.810 --> 25:06.051
He's got a steel plate in his head.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.113
But fortunately for us... you and me...

25:08.213 --> 25:09.835
he's a whiz at auto parts.

25:09.935 --> 25:12.798
Gus, let's talk gaskets.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.642
What the fuck was that?

25:16.742 --> 25:17.943
That was the sound of
me waiting in the car

25:18.023 --> 25:19.284
at your next sales call.

25:19.384 --> 25:20.806
- I loved the God run.
- Oh, thank you.

25:20.906 --> 25:22.588
You did not see the
crucifix on the way in.

25:22.668 --> 25:24.249
Ohh, I did not.

25:24.349 --> 25:25.691
God!

25:25.791 --> 25:28.013
Ah, I'm so fucked.

25:28.113 --> 25:30.295
Yep. Probably.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.297
Chamomile tea
is very good for you.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.881
But I can't remember if it's a
flower or a beautiful weed.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.385
Hey, Nick.

25:40.485 --> 25:42.387
Nick, look who's here.
It's Teddy from New York.

25:42.487 --> 25:45.190
Remember Teddy?

25:45.290 --> 25:46.912
Yeah, I remember Ted.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.275
Remember his cabaret club on 23rd?

25:50.375 --> 25:51.577
- Mm-hmm.
- We saw Peter, Paul and Mary

25:51.657 --> 25:52.958
there.

25:53.058 --> 25:55.641
Your check came.

25:55.741 --> 25:57.943
It's the brand-new television
we talked about getting.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.765
Remember?

25:59.865 --> 26:01.166
Yeah, right.

26:01.266 --> 26:02.648
Right.

26:02.748 --> 26:05.290
- It's 32 inches.
- Mm.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.392
I didn't give you a proper welcome.

26:15.881 --> 26:17.883
Excuse me.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.673
Just moved in, so...

26:27.773 --> 26:29.294
Tawny's putting it together as we go.

26:29.374 --> 26:32.317
Hey, in New York, you
find a rug mid-town,

26:32.417 --> 26:35.300
you drag it all the way
down to the Village.

26:39.945 --> 26:41.326
So, what can I do for you, Ted?

26:41.426 --> 26:43.088
I saw you on Carson.

26:43.188 --> 26:44.850
Mm.

26:44.950 --> 26:48.333
Want to see if I can convince
you to come play my club.

26:48.433 --> 26:50.295
Afraid Goldie's already beat you to it.

26:50.395 --> 26:52.057
Mm.

26:52.157 --> 26:54.179
<i>She always does.</i>

26:54.279 --> 26:56.982
<i>Plus, the phone's
ringing off the hook, so...</i>

26:57.082 --> 26:58.383
<i>lot of shit happening.</i>

26:58.483 --> 27:00.505
I know. I tried calling.

27:00.605 --> 27:02.668
Your answering service
could barely speak,

27:02.768 --> 27:05.390
and then she hung up on me.

27:05.490 --> 27:08.714
Hope all those big mucky-mucks
are getting through.

27:08.814 --> 27:12.978
Hey, who loves
a soft peddler, huh?

27:15.340 --> 27:17.803
Always nice to see old friends
from New York, Teddy.

27:17.903 --> 27:20.846
Look, Nicky, I'm not judging.

27:20.946 --> 27:23.048
You know what I had for
breakfast this morning?

27:23.148 --> 27:25.691
Had three fingers of Scotch
and some banana bread.

27:25.791 --> 27:28.173
We've all got our shit, Nick.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.976
<i>Shit still costs money.</i>

27:31.076 --> 27:32.858
<i>So, how much is she paying you? Right.</i>

27:32.958 --> 27:35.340
<i>Besides promising you
the moon, of course.</i>

27:38.123 --> 27:40.946
See, that's why she drives a Caddy.

27:41.046 --> 27:43.048
Now...

27:46.772 --> 27:49.274
I will give you half the door

27:49.374 --> 27:52.838
if you work for me
exclusively for one month.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.239
Cash.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.541
Thanks. I'm good.

27:57.903 --> 28:00.405
<i>All right, Nick.</i>

28:00.505 --> 28:03.208
<i>Cards on the table.</i>

28:03.308 --> 28:06.171
<i>Folks like Goldie, they
don't understand survival.</i>

28:06.271 --> 28:08.974
<i>Top of the food chain never does.</i>

28:09.074 --> 28:10.876
<i>Big picture, it sounds nice in theory.</i>

28:10.956 --> 28:12.337
<i>Guys like me and you?</i>

28:12.437 --> 28:14.820
<i>We live in a snapshot of right now.</i>

28:14.920 --> 28:17.102
<i>So, I say fuck the moon.</i>

28:17.202 --> 28:18.864
Man's got to live, right?

28:24.289 --> 28:28.173
Well, um, I'll be going.

28:29.294 --> 28:31.797
You think it over.

28:31.897 --> 28:33.899
Yeah.

28:36.061 --> 28:38.363
Motorola Quasar.

28:38.463 --> 28:40.465
Nice.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.516
You know she did the right
thing dumping you, right?

30:12.637 --> 30:14.339
You're a total loser

30:14.439 --> 30:16.281
and you have the intellectual
acumen of a goldfish

30:16.361 --> 30:18.363
floating on its back.

30:18.964 --> 30:20.665
You know, if we were in a meadow,

30:20.765 --> 30:23.909
I'd be running towards you
right now in slow motion.

30:24.009 --> 30:27.432
Fuck Cassie, man. It's her loss!

30:27.532 --> 30:29.995
You think this is about Cassie?

30:30.095 --> 30:31.957
It's Dionne Warwick, man.

30:32.057 --> 30:33.759
She was on <i>Midnight Special</i>

30:33.859 --> 30:35.861
the night I was supposed to do it.

30:38.543 --> 30:42.047
Okay, well, let's, uh, find some
music that doesn't commemorate

30:42.147 --> 30:45.190
one of your many failures, huh?
Thank you.

30:53.718 --> 30:55.660
Well, you're here early.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.742
What are you doing?

30:57.842 --> 31:00.866
Reveling in your Carson buzz?

31:00.966 --> 31:02.747
Waiting to talk to Goldie.

31:02.847 --> 31:06.311
- Fun.
- Yeah.

31:06.411 --> 31:08.353
Saw your stuff the other night.

31:08.453 --> 31:10.796
That is some out-there shit.

31:10.896 --> 31:12.677
Well, I'll just take
that as a compliment

31:12.777 --> 31:15.480
and change the subject to the weather.

31:16.621 --> 31:18.804
Where's tall, red, and angry?

31:18.904 --> 31:23.488
Bill and I aren't exactly
on speaking terms.

31:23.588 --> 31:26.411
Or really any terms right now.

31:26.511 --> 31:30.215
Oh, I think, with Bill,

31:30.315 --> 31:32.597
détente is the most any
of us can hope for.

31:34.399 --> 31:36.461
I'm doing this industrial later.

31:36.561 --> 31:39.024
There's nothing wrong with a
little quick cash, right?

31:39.124 --> 31:40.745
Not from where I sit.

31:40.845 --> 31:44.469
No fucking clue what it is
I'm doing going up there.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.031
Hell of a way to make a living.

31:48.773 --> 31:50.175
"I shall be telling this with a sigh

31:50.255 --> 31:52.477
somewhere ages and ages hence:

31:52.577 --> 31:55.000
two roads diverged in a wood, and I...

31:55.100 --> 31:56.421
I took the one less traveled by,

31:56.501 --> 32:00.485
and that has made all the difference."

32:00.585 --> 32:03.969
Is that what I'm doing
going up there tonight?

32:04.069 --> 32:06.071
Taking the road less traveled by?

32:07.832 --> 32:10.375
Everybody thinks Frost was

32:10.475 --> 32:12.357
talking about taking the
road less traveled being

32:12.437 --> 32:14.339
the difference between
betcha-by-golly-wow

32:14.439 --> 32:16.701
and a life of quiet desperation.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.783
It's bullshit.

32:18.883 --> 32:22.187
Is this the part where I
smile, bat my eyelashes,

32:22.287 --> 32:24.289
and ask you to go on?

32:26.771 --> 32:30.115
Every path will fuck you to some extent.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.716
Think about it.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.880
What would you be doing if
you'd chosen another path?

32:34.980 --> 32:36.321
Second-grade school teacher?

32:36.421 --> 32:37.842
Popped out a half-dozen kids?

32:37.942 --> 32:40.365
Hang yourself at 30?

32:40.465 --> 32:43.488
You chose this path.

32:43.588 --> 32:47.052
Nothing to do now but cross your
fingers and see what happens.

32:47.152 --> 32:49.134
Follow the yellow brick road.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.236
Follow the yellow brick road.

32:56.881 --> 32:58.503
- Ah, thank you.
- Eh.

32:58.603 --> 33:00.605
Thank you.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.071
I could do this.

33:06.171 --> 33:08.153
Open road, steady paycheck.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.715
Yeah. It's a nice...

33:10.815 --> 33:12.677
peaceful death.

33:12.777 --> 33:14.399
Like a coal miner falling asleep

33:14.499 --> 33:18.523
as the last bit of oxygen is
sucked out of the cave-in.

33:18.623 --> 33:21.446
Yeah. At least you got a
wife and kids to go home to.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.008
- A real life.
- You know, I'm starting

33:23.108 --> 33:25.170
to think real life is overrated.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.112
That's 'cause you don't remember
what it was like being single.

33:27.192 --> 33:29.374
I remember there was
a lot more blowjobs.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.276
What, you don't get blown
when you're married?

33:31.356 --> 33:32.737
Just holidays.

33:32.837 --> 33:34.239
Well, now I have Father's Day.
That's nice.

33:34.319 --> 33:35.640
So, basically, if there's no mail,

33:35.720 --> 33:36.821
you get a blowjob.

33:42.607 --> 33:45.550
I'm starting to hate the fucking quiet.

33:45.650 --> 33:48.913
It's like we wait all day
for these 15 minutes.

33:49.013 --> 33:53.358
Then maybe Canter's, home,
television, bowl of cereal.

33:53.458 --> 33:54.839
Lather, rinse, repeat.

33:54.939 --> 33:56.401
Are you insane?

33:56.501 --> 33:58.323
You know my average
shit takes 45 minutes

33:58.423 --> 33:59.924
'cause that's my only time alone?

34:00.024 --> 34:02.707
I'm done after five minutes,
and the rest is just sighing

34:02.787 --> 34:04.409
and <i>Reader's Digest.</i>

34:04.509 --> 34:06.331
Yeah? Last night, I ate SpaghettiOs

34:06.431 --> 34:08.112
out of the pan in my
boxers while watching

34:08.193 --> 34:11.335
<i>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.</i>

34:11.436 --> 34:13.898
I went to Sears to look
for refrigerators.

34:13.998 --> 34:17.101
I got so dizzy I had to lay
on the patio furniture.

34:17.202 --> 34:18.483
There's a mannequin with, you know,

34:18.563 --> 34:20.425
- barbecue tongs next to me.
- Mm-hmm.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.667
We were wearing the same pants.

34:22.766 --> 34:23.967
What, did we both just sprout vaginas

34:24.047 --> 34:25.310
in the last five minutes?

34:25.409 --> 34:26.571
We did get a little chatty, didn't we?

34:26.650 --> 34:27.752
Yeah.

34:27.851 --> 34:29.234
- I think I know why.
- What?

34:29.333 --> 34:30.915
- Yeah. Turn around.
- What are you doing?

34:31.014 --> 34:32.777
What are you doing? What
the fuck are you doing?

34:32.857 --> 34:34.759
God!

34:34.859 --> 34:36.081
That shirt, man!

34:36.181 --> 34:37.601
Cassie got it for you.

34:37.702 --> 34:40.605
It's turning our testicles into ovaries.

34:42.867 --> 34:44.369
Is it better? Yeah?

34:44.469 --> 34:46.030
Yeah. I got to admit I kind of feel like

34:46.110 --> 34:47.752
talking about last night's
game and spitting in public.

34:47.831 --> 34:49.014
- See?
- Mm.

34:49.114 --> 34:51.116
No, that fucking thing is cursed.

34:56.201 --> 34:58.583
I fucking hate that I miss her.

34:58.683 --> 35:00.685
I know.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.149
But...

35:04.249 --> 35:05.110
the breeze is nice.

35:05.210 --> 35:06.551
Yeah.

35:22.907 --> 35:25.250
Hey, uh, we are actually ready to order.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.651
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah. We'll just have

35:26.751 --> 35:28.593
four of your delightful
cheddar burgers, please.

35:28.673 --> 35:30.195
Okay. You don't want
to hear the specials?

35:30.275 --> 35:31.536
- Nah.
- Oh, specials.

35:31.636 --> 35:33.698
They always have great specials.
What are they?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.580
Well, tonight, it's lobster tails

35:35.680 --> 35:37.502
with drawn butter and baked potato

35:37.602 --> 35:38.823
for $9.95.

35:38.923 --> 35:40.625
- Huh.
- I-I-I-I think the delightful

35:40.725 --> 35:41.726
cheddar burgers will work out...

35:41.806 --> 35:45.049
I'll have the lobster tails. Oh, me too.

35:47.412 --> 35:49.594
Can we just look at the menus again?

35:49.694 --> 35:51.596
Uh, yeah, sure.

35:51.696 --> 35:52.997
Here you go.

35:53.097 --> 35:55.099
Thank you.

36:10.475 --> 36:11.776
Can I help you?

36:11.876 --> 36:14.339
Hi. I'm Cassie Feder.

36:14.439 --> 36:17.262
I'm here to do the TWA show.

36:17.362 --> 36:19.104
Ralph sent me.

36:19.204 --> 36:21.426
You're a woman.

36:21.526 --> 36:23.748
Hence the vagina.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.990
Is that a problem?

36:26.090 --> 36:28.353
Well, you're here now.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.954
You ever done one of these before?

36:30.054 --> 36:31.476
Nope. First time.

36:31.576 --> 36:33.678
Well, enjoy the deep end of the pool.

36:33.778 --> 36:35.780
You're on in ten.

36:37.101 --> 36:38.763
Fucking lobster tails?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.425
We got 25 bucks. Just their
fucking lobster tails alone

36:40.505 --> 36:41.686
are gonna put us at 20.

36:41.786 --> 36:43.388
I know, I know. Just
the way they went on

36:43.468 --> 36:44.789
about the cheeseburgers, I just
thought it was a done deal.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.870
You know, this is complete bullshit,

36:45.950 --> 36:47.732
and you do this all the time.

36:47.832 --> 36:49.594
No, it's... no, it's not my...
it's the fucking waiter, man.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.636
He blindsided us with those
fucking lobster tails.

36:51.716 --> 36:53.097
Hey! Hey!

36:53.197 --> 36:55.540
Dude! You totally fucked us.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.302
- What?
- We had 25 bucks,

36:57.402 --> 36:58.803
which is perfect for four cheeseburgers,

36:58.883 --> 37:01.926
but then you totally fucked us
with your $9.95 lobster tails.

37:02.006 --> 37:05.710
Sorry. If it's any consolation,
they're really good.

37:05.810 --> 37:09.394
No. Any consolation would be
four fucking cheeseburgers.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.516
Look, is there anything you can do

37:11.616 --> 37:13.878
to help us not look like losers?

37:13.978 --> 37:15.840
He really needs to get laid.

37:15.940 --> 37:19.083
Right now, my dick is like a
grenade with the pin pulled out.

37:19.183 --> 37:23.127
Uh, well, uh, there's
our hot wing challenge.

37:23.227 --> 37:25.490
Eat a bucket of our hot wings
in 15 minutes or less,

37:25.590 --> 37:27.412
- and they're on us.
- As in free?

37:27.512 --> 37:29.174
You still got to pay
for the girls' food,

37:29.274 --> 37:32.857
but it's the best I can do.

37:32.957 --> 37:34.098
- Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

37:34.198 --> 37:35.740
- Two orders.
- Fifteen minutes?

37:35.840 --> 37:39.083
Yeah. Just be warned, though:
they're really fucking hot.

37:41.446 --> 37:42.907
Yeah, I mean, how hot can they be?

37:43.007 --> 37:45.550
How many of you mothers
in here hate your kids?

37:47.051 --> 37:50.995
Nobody? I'm not talking
about husband hate.

37:51.095 --> 37:55.400
I mean more like a kid-sized
portion of disdain.

37:56.821 --> 37:58.843
Now, listen. I don't
hate being a mother.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.126
I just hate the word "mom."

38:02.226 --> 38:03.968
Ugh!

38:04.068 --> 38:07.532
To me, when I hear "mom,"
it's like hearing "fire!"

38:07.632 --> 38:12.016
And I just want to run as fast
as I can in the other direction.

38:12.116 --> 38:14.559
I don't even want to
stop to drop and roll.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.784
And there are just so many annoying ways

38:19.884 --> 38:21.226
for kids to say it:

38:21.326 --> 38:22.507
Mommy,

38:22.607 --> 38:23.548
Mama,

38:23.648 --> 38:25.430
Ma!

38:25.530 --> 38:27.792
I just can't wait to die, basically.

38:27.892 --> 38:30.194
We've known each other a long time.

38:30.294 --> 38:32.156
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

38:32.256 --> 38:34.919
Yeah, 'cause "fuck you" sounds
so much nicer in person?

38:35.019 --> 38:37.722
It's a month. Then if
you want me back...

38:37.822 --> 38:39.804
You're hot now.

38:39.904 --> 38:41.886
We had an agreement.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.089
Got to keep the lights on.

38:47.231 --> 38:49.454
- What's he promising?
- Half the door.

38:49.554 --> 38:53.137
That's half
of nothing nowadays.

38:53.237 --> 38:56.941
Little more than what you pay.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.443
You want to settle for a few bucks

38:58.523 --> 38:59.924
when you could walk off of my stage

39:00.004 --> 39:01.746
with the world by the short hairs?

39:01.846 --> 39:03.107
Your call.

39:03.207 --> 39:05.670
I just thought you were
smarter than that is all.

39:05.770 --> 39:08.833
Look. I love magic beans just
as much as the next guy,

39:08.933 --> 39:12.437
but I'm just trying to
get through the day.

39:12.537 --> 39:15.039
And then what?

39:15.139 --> 39:17.762
There's big things coming down the road.

39:17.862 --> 39:20.765
How far down the road are we talking?

39:20.865 --> 39:22.807
Because it's great
when you have a Caddy,

39:22.907 --> 39:24.649
but it's a bitch when you're hoofing it

39:24.749 --> 39:26.751
with an anvil on your back.

39:28.393 --> 39:30.655
It's not an anvil on your back.

39:33.758 --> 39:35.740
What? Am I wrong?

39:39.243 --> 39:41.946
I never pegged you for a sucker, Nick.

39:43.728 --> 39:45.510
Is that my cue to sit back down?

39:45.610 --> 39:49.193
Sit, stand, leave, go shoot
up in a fucking alley.

39:49.293 --> 39:50.755
Your call.

39:57.261 --> 39:59.764
He's buying low, Nick.

39:59.864 --> 40:02.086
Yeah? What are you buying?

40:02.186 --> 40:04.048
Me? I'm betting on the man.

40:04.148 --> 40:05.610
He's betting on the junkie.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.632
He knows junkie's are all
about the short-term,

40:07.712 --> 40:10.294
and you will take whatever
fucking pittance he offers.

40:10.394 --> 40:13.338
And you're offering...
what is it, again?

40:13.438 --> 40:17.141
Oh, right. Tomorrow.

40:17.241 --> 40:19.624
Tomorrow's all you got.

40:19.724 --> 40:23.267
And even that's hanging by a thread.

40:23.367 --> 40:27.592
I got a stack of messages from
people calling me to get to you.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.555
How many calls you
think Teddy's got? Hm?

40:30.655 --> 40:31.836
He's just some blowhard.

40:31.936 --> 40:34.078
Had a club in New York
a hundred years ago

40:34.178 --> 40:36.641
that Bob Dylan and
Woody Allen farted in,

40:36.741 --> 40:38.302
and now he thinks he can come out here

40:38.382 --> 40:41.646
and, in two years, pull off
what I, in one way or another,

40:41.746 --> 40:44.649
have been doing my entire fucking life.

40:44.749 --> 40:47.772
The connections I've nurtured,
the careers I've made...

40:47.872 --> 40:50.375
I own this motherfucking strip!

40:50.475 --> 40:53.057
Fuck the Store and fuck the Troubadour

40:53.157 --> 40:57.702
and fuck that shithead
for betting on you dying

40:57.802 --> 41:00.505
and not on the artist
we both know you are.

41:02.006 --> 41:05.750
Want to know why you'll stay here, Nick?

41:05.850 --> 41:09.714
Because if you don't, you will die.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.077
Far as I can tell,

41:13.177 --> 41:16.681
magic beans are the only
real option you have left.

41:18.583 --> 41:21.205
I know you'll get your
shit straightened out.

41:23.467 --> 41:26.531
You go up in an hour, hm?

41:34.318 --> 41:36.180
So, Gail,

41:36.280 --> 41:39.624
Ron tells me your father's a podiatrist.

41:39.724 --> 41:41.025
Twenty years.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.428
That's some feat.

41:43.528 --> 41:45.710
Don't.

41:45.810 --> 41:48.633
Christy's dad is a mechanic

41:48.733 --> 41:49.954
- and amateur geologist.
- Hmm.

41:50.054 --> 41:51.836
Could we get some water
over here, please?

41:54.138 --> 41:55.560
Food should not hurt like this.

41:55.660 --> 41:57.662
- Six minutes, guys.
- Ah!

42:04.348 --> 42:06.811
So, how many of you guys
have ever flown drunk?

42:07.992 --> 42:09.133
Oh, I think I see a hand

42:09.233 --> 42:10.615
coming up from under the table.

42:10.715 --> 42:12.176
Is that you, Ned Gibbs?

42:13.758 --> 42:14.879
- Hey! Classic Ned.
- I wouldn't mind

42:14.959 --> 42:16.260
seeing you under my table!

42:16.360 --> 42:17.982
Oh, my.

42:18.082 --> 42:21.065
This man, ladies and gentlemen,
is why I take the bus.

42:21.165 --> 42:23.187
You want to join the Mile High Club?

42:23.287 --> 42:24.749
With you? Oh, no, thanks.

42:24.849 --> 42:26.070
But if it's any consolation,

42:26.170 --> 42:28.432
I would consider joining
the Mile Away Club.

42:28.532 --> 42:30.294
Seriously, if your dick is

42:30.374 --> 42:31.956
as big as your mouth, maybe,

42:32.056 --> 42:33.257
but I'm betting it's
as big as your brain,

42:33.337 --> 42:35.399
so enjoy your solo flight.

42:35.499 --> 42:37.802
Yeah! All right!

42:43.908 --> 42:46.571
You guys don't look like you're
enjoying your wings that much.

42:46.671 --> 42:47.932
Oh, no. What? Are you kidding?

42:48.032 --> 42:49.854
These are tears of deliciousness.

42:49.954 --> 42:51.475
Maybe if you slowed down a little bit.

42:51.555 --> 42:55.219
No, no, no. Everybody knows
speed enhances flavor.

42:55.319 --> 42:56.901
- I'm done.
- No, you're not.

42:57.001 --> 42:58.823
- I quit, Ron, okay? I quit!
- No, you're not.

42:58.923 --> 43:00.344
I got half of Rosemary's baby

43:00.444 --> 43:02.006
sticking out of my
asshole right now, okay?

43:02.086 --> 43:05.029
- I quit. I'm done.
- Guys, what's going on?

43:05.129 --> 43:08.192
- Nothing.
- The truth is that...

43:08.292 --> 43:10.795
Ron wanted to impress one of you,

43:10.895 --> 43:13.958
but we don't have enough money
to pay for all four meals,

43:14.058 --> 43:16.280
so we took the Hot Wings Challenge,

43:16.380 --> 43:17.922
and now I think we're dying.

43:18.022 --> 43:19.123
It burns when I blink.

43:19.223 --> 43:22.006
Oh, my God. That is so sweet.

43:22.106 --> 43:25.489
Why didn't you say something?
We can totally chip in.

43:25.589 --> 43:27.331
That you'd do that for us

43:27.431 --> 43:29.113
makes me wish we weren't
celibate right now.

43:29.193 --> 43:31.195
Celi-what?

43:32.356 --> 43:34.458
Celibate. For a year.

43:34.558 --> 43:36.941
Hello? Newly sober.

43:37.041 --> 43:38.382
You're in the program.

43:38.482 --> 43:40.384
No sex for the first year of sobriety.

43:40.484 --> 43:42.486
Builds a strong foundation.

43:44.528 --> 43:47.071
So, sex is-is totally off
the-the table, then?

43:47.171 --> 43:50.074
I know. Sucks, right?

43:57.461 --> 43:59.463
You did not just do that.

44:00.624 --> 44:01.966
Yeah, I'm just sort of hoping

44:02.066 --> 44:03.527
a year from now you won't remember.

44:03.627 --> 44:05.629
Thank you.

44:07.471 --> 44:10.775
So, who had the lobster tails?

44:10.875 --> 44:13.938
What did I tell you?
Cozwell a winner, or what?

44:14.038 --> 44:15.419
You do know how to pick 'em, Gold.

44:15.519 --> 44:18.022
She's good. I'll give you that.

44:18.122 --> 44:20.144
You want to kick it up
a notch, there, Marty?

44:20.244 --> 44:21.986
You're barely at faint praise.

44:22.086 --> 44:24.548
I just feel we should be
going a different way.

44:24.648 --> 44:26.110
And what way is that?

44:26.210 --> 44:28.032
Not funny?

44:28.132 --> 44:30.034
Who's the cute blonde
you got going up here?

44:30.134 --> 44:31.756
Does the Texas Jew thing.

44:31.856 --> 44:33.317
Some of my guys saw her.

44:33.417 --> 44:35.199
They think she really has something.

44:35.299 --> 44:37.001
Cassie Feder?

44:37.101 --> 44:39.764
Eh, if she's the cute blonde
with the twang, then yeah, her.

44:39.864 --> 44:41.606
Believe me. Karen is the way to go.

44:41.706 --> 44:43.848
Sure, yeah, if we're doing radio.

44:43.948 --> 44:47.291
What is this? A fucking
Miss America pageant now?

44:47.391 --> 44:49.934
I-I mean, you made that girl
do a whole dog and pony.

44:50.034 --> 44:51.956
You could've made that
call from her headshot.

44:52.036 --> 44:55.139
Marty, what's looks got
to do with funny, anyway?

44:55.239 --> 44:56.500
Yeah.

44:56.600 --> 44:59.383
Diller, Rivers, Burnett...

44:59.483 --> 45:01.225
they're not exactly centerfolds.

45:01.325 --> 45:02.707
You make my point, Eli.

45:02.807 --> 45:04.068
This is the new guard.

45:04.168 --> 45:06.110
It shouldn't look like the old guard.

45:06.210 --> 45:08.392
We want the next Goldie Hawn,

45:08.492 --> 45:09.874
not the next Ruth Buzzi.

45:09.974 --> 45:11.595
Cassie's not ready yet.

45:11.695 --> 45:13.077
I got a laugh track says she is.

45:13.177 --> 45:16.080
So, if we're understanding you,

45:16.180 --> 45:18.242
we agree to this, the
project moves forward?

45:18.342 --> 45:20.825
Green. Lit.

45:27.912 --> 45:29.373
Uh, Ralph said the pay was 200.

45:29.473 --> 45:32.657
It is if you're Ralph.

45:32.757 --> 45:34.939
Let me know if you want to
do any more of these gigs.

45:35.039 --> 45:37.742
There's a novelty aspect to
a woman who can go blue.

45:37.842 --> 45:40.104
Plays well on both sides of the aisle.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.747
Like a chicken playing piano?

45:42.847 --> 45:45.750
Little late to slip the
bow back into your hair.

45:45.850 --> 45:47.852
Keep in touch.

46:05.309 --> 46:08.252
Hey, funny lady. You
got me good in there.

46:08.352 --> 46:11.335
Oh, I hope I
wasn't too tough on you.

46:11.435 --> 46:13.778
Oh, no hard feelings.

46:13.878 --> 46:17.141
So, how long have you been doing comedy?

46:17.241 --> 46:18.662
About two years now.

46:18.762 --> 46:20.785
I can't say I didn't have it coming.

46:20.885 --> 46:21.966
Well, you're a good sport.

46:22.046 --> 46:23.467
Thanks for playing along.

46:23.567 --> 46:25.129
I don't suppose I could
buy you one drink,

46:25.209 --> 46:26.831
make up for my bad behavior?

46:26.931 --> 46:28.512
Oh, that's very sweet. Thank you.

46:28.612 --> 46:31.315
But I got another gig. It's
at 1:45 in the morning,

46:31.415 --> 46:33.157
so I better move it along.

46:33.257 --> 46:34.939
All right, so that's it? Your
last impression of me is

46:35.019 --> 46:37.802
gonna be the asshole just
shouting sexual innuendo

46:37.902 --> 46:40.704
from the audience? No. No asshole.

46:40.784 --> 46:42.246
But I do have to go.

46:42.346 --> 46:45.069
One drink. Then I'll let
you be on your merry way.

46:49.233 --> 46:51.816
Now, I bet you're into guys
who like to be humiliated.

46:51.916 --> 46:53.918
It's not really my thing.

46:55.679 --> 46:57.742
Please take your hand off me.

46:57.842 --> 47:00.144
Oh, hey, come on. What
happened to the girl

47:00.244 --> 47:01.145
that was up on stage?

47:01.245 --> 47:03.267
I like her better.

47:03.367 --> 47:05.309
I need you to get the fuck away from me.

47:05.409 --> 47:06.710
Look.

47:06.810 --> 47:08.552
I've been with a hundred stewardesses.

47:08.652 --> 47:09.894
I know what's an act and what's not.

47:09.974 --> 47:11.195
Get off of me!

47:11.295 --> 47:13.477
- Back the fuck up, asshole!
- Aah!

47:13.577 --> 47:16.680
Fuck! Fucking bitch!

47:16.780 --> 47:18.782
Fucking-a!

47:19.823 --> 47:21.125
You okay, honey?

47:33.878 --> 47:35.219
Might want to stock up.

47:59.103 --> 48:00.965
<i>How'd it go?</i>

48:01.065 --> 48:02.606
Eh...

48:02.706 --> 48:05.689
so-so.

48:05.789 --> 48:09.293
No one seemed to really be
in a buying mood today.

48:09.393 --> 48:11.976
<i>That's okay.
You'll get 'em tomorrow.</i>

48:12.076 --> 48:13.938
I wish I had your confidence.

48:14.038 --> 48:16.100
<i>I think you need a pep talk.</i>

48:16.200 --> 48:18.222
Hey, tell Daddy how
proud you are of him.

48:18.322 --> 48:19.623
Tell him.

48:20.804 --> 48:22.466
<i>Daddy works so hard.</i>

48:22.566 --> 48:25.129
<i>Yes, he does. Yes, he does!</i>

48:29.693 --> 48:31.435
Courvoisier.

48:31.535 --> 48:34.358
Ain't you supposed to mix this
with Coca-Cola or some shit?

48:34.458 --> 48:36.780
At $22 a bottle, hell no.

48:39.303 --> 48:41.465
You know, I made this bar myself.

48:44.148 --> 48:47.591
Shit, something like
that run you 800 bucks.

48:48.792 --> 48:51.295
Hell, you know, I made all this.

48:51.395 --> 48:53.697
I mean, I didn't make it with my hands,

48:53.797 --> 48:56.540
just... shit didn't just appear.

48:56.640 --> 48:58.943
You-you hear what I'm saying?

48:59.043 --> 49:01.045
Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

49:02.566 --> 49:04.508
You could have shit, too.
I have seen your act.

49:04.608 --> 49:06.310
You a talented motherfucker.

49:06.410 --> 49:08.552
Thank you.

49:08.652 --> 49:12.436
I guess I'm not sure
what I want anymore.

49:12.536 --> 49:14.879
Heh! What's to know?

49:14.979 --> 49:16.981
Don't you want success?

49:18.462 --> 49:20.965
I'm sitting deep in the end zone.

49:21.065 --> 49:22.046
Feel me?

49:22.146 --> 49:24.008
I got you. I got you.

49:24.108 --> 49:25.609
It's just...

49:25.709 --> 49:27.531
like, Sonny and Cher?

49:27.631 --> 49:29.133
I don't think I can do that.

49:29.233 --> 49:32.616
Maybe before. But n-now it's...

49:32.716 --> 49:35.339
I think I want something different.

49:35.439 --> 49:37.441
Mm.

49:39.123 --> 49:41.345
Different?

49:41.445 --> 49:44.788
You mean like camping out at a
whorehouse, living off scraps?

49:44.888 --> 49:46.190
That kind of different?

49:46.290 --> 49:50.274
Or hitching your wagon
to a pimp in shiny shoes

49:50.374 --> 49:53.557
dressing like he got
someplace to go different?

49:55.899 --> 49:57.401
No. I mean respect different.

49:57.501 --> 50:00.324
Oh, you don't think I get respect?

50:00.424 --> 50:02.006
Oh, now you lost your tongue?

50:02.106 --> 50:04.808
Like, wait. What, you think you made it?

50:04.908 --> 50:07.091
You think this sorry-ass bar
you made or any of this

50:07.191 --> 50:08.892
means shit to me?

50:08.992 --> 50:10.374
You don't know sacrifice.

50:10.474 --> 50:11.695
And you know it too well.

50:11.795 --> 50:14.058
You know, who the fuck
do you think you are?

50:14.158 --> 50:16.020
You in my fucking house.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.662
You think you're Gregory? Pryor?

50:18.762 --> 50:21.065
You're not. You're just a trifling nigga

50:21.165 --> 50:22.266
standing on a stepstool

50:22.366 --> 50:24.368
pretending like it's Mount Sinai.

50:28.772 --> 50:30.774
Thanks for dinner.

50:32.336 --> 50:35.599
You want to talk about respect?

50:35.699 --> 50:38.922
Men have lived because I
got motherfucking respect!

50:58.322 --> 51:00.624
I called Gus.

51:00.724 --> 51:03.667
I'm meeting him for drinks.

51:03.767 --> 51:05.669
Dude, it's getting late.
We go up in an hour.

51:05.769 --> 51:09.393
I-I'll... I'll... I'll
drop you off at Goldie's.

51:09.493 --> 51:12.836
I got to...

51:12.936 --> 51:16.400
fix that mess from earlier.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.502
Seriously?

51:19.863 --> 51:21.865
All right.

51:28.112 --> 51:29.733
For when you clock out, huh?

51:33.837 --> 51:35.279
Most people say thank you
when you get a joint.

51:35.359 --> 51:37.361
- Fuck you.
- Eh.

51:39.443 --> 51:42.506
Seriously, you
have to start chipping in.

51:42.606 --> 51:45.229
It's not my fault. I mean... I
mean, this wasn't our plan.

51:45.329 --> 51:46.810
Your friend who was supposed
to give us a place to live

51:46.890 --> 51:48.592
got hit by a fucking bus.

51:48.692 --> 51:50.874
I mean, at least admit that's
sort of a monkey wrench.

51:50.974 --> 51:52.676
So, what?

51:52.776 --> 51:55.679
You still got to do something.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.901
You're like the story of the
ant and the grasshopper.

51:57.981 --> 52:00.003
The what?

52:00.103 --> 52:02.126
The ant and the grasshopper.

52:02.226 --> 52:03.407
The ant busts his ass

52:03.507 --> 52:05.489
while the grasshopper
jerks off all summer.

52:05.589 --> 52:07.831
Then when the fucking winter
comes, the grasshopper's like,

52:07.911 --> 52:09.693
"Help me, ant," and the ant is like,

52:09.793 --> 52:12.176
"Fuck you, grasshopper.
I work for a living."

52:12.276 --> 52:14.778
So, the moral of the story
is the ant's a fucking dick?

52:14.878 --> 52:17.621
No. The moral of the story is
no one owes you shit, Ron.

52:17.721 --> 52:19.723
Get a fucking job.

52:54.157 --> 52:56.500
Hey.

53:00.844 --> 53:02.106
You okay?

53:02.206 --> 53:05.389
Yeah. I'm great.

53:35.959 --> 53:38.782
What's it like being a guy?

53:38.882 --> 53:41.305
Just to get to be funny
and not have to worry

53:41.405 --> 53:42.726
about someone yelling about your tits

53:42.806 --> 53:44.808
every time you get onstage?

53:46.410 --> 53:48.452
Well, to be fair, that's just
because I tape them down

53:48.532 --> 53:50.534
before every show.

53:55.739 --> 53:59.283
Look. Every time any one of
us gets up on that stage,

53:59.383 --> 54:01.465
there's some perception
we're trying to overcome.

54:01.545 --> 54:04.007
No. It's different.

54:04.107 --> 54:07.271
Women get up there, and it's
a fucking shooting gallery.

54:10.193 --> 54:12.896
Phyllis Diller intentionally
makes herself unattractive

54:12.996 --> 54:16.260
so that people will
focus on what she says.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.922
She has to hide who she
is just to be who she is.

54:21.004 --> 54:23.947
Sounds like every comic I've ever met.

54:24.047 --> 54:26.049
Oh, yeah? What are you hiding?

54:28.211 --> 54:30.714
Hmm?

54:30.814 --> 54:32.816
I came here to comfort you.

54:36.540 --> 54:38.542
Goldie wants to see you.

54:41.305 --> 54:43.507
Great.

55:28.031 --> 55:30.033
Close the door.

55:32.756 --> 55:34.177
You're in.

55:34.277 --> 55:35.379
In what?

55:35.479 --> 55:37.481
<i>Girls Are Funny, Too.</i>

55:38.842 --> 55:41.224
That's what you wanted, right?

55:41.324 --> 55:42.626
Of course it's what I wanted.

55:42.726 --> 55:45.869
Good.

55:45.969 --> 55:48.251
I-I don't... I don't understand.

55:49.733 --> 55:50.994
I didn't even audition,

55:51.094 --> 55:53.236
and you told me that
my act wasn't ready.

55:53.336 --> 55:55.919
Who said anything about doing your act?

55:56.019 --> 55:58.842
They want the girl from <i>Wink.</i>

55:58.942 --> 56:00.684
But I don't do that anymore.

56:00.784 --> 56:03.847
You've been invited to
the ball, Cinderella.

56:03.947 --> 56:06.089
You can go back to your
pumpkin after midnight.

56:06.189 --> 56:09.613
Right now, I need you to
look pretty and be funny.

56:11.995 --> 56:12.976
In that order?

56:13.076 --> 56:15.138
In that order.

56:15.238 --> 56:17.301
Come in tomorrow. We'll
start working on your set.

56:17.401 --> 56:19.863
This is gonna move like a freight train.

56:28.652 --> 56:32.155
Do you believe in me?

56:32.255 --> 56:35.679
It's been my experience
that most leaps of faith

56:35.779 --> 56:38.642
are often preceded by a shove.

56:41.825 --> 56:43.607
<i>They are going to make you</i>

56:43.707 --> 56:46.650
<i>one of them, my peacock.</i>

56:46.750 --> 56:49.212
<i>One of us. One of us.</i>

56:49.312 --> 56:51.695
