to watch you bend over.

 <i>The Eight Family</i> or something.

that they all get together,

and, well, I don't really know
what it was about,

03:25.501 --> 03:27.667
but the important thing is
they were all together,

03:27.667 --> 03:29.367
and they did it as a family.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.067
Now, it made me think.

See, we could
do more together.

about each other?

On the first
sunny day in May,

go to the beach

with Mr. Summer.

another little tradition I have.

What do you want?

05:49.834 --> 05:51.300
Well, I, uh,

05:51.300 --> 05:55.100
had a little fender bender
with a rather large gentleman.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.033
So I did what any thinking adult
would do,

05:57.033 --> 06:00.367

and screamed, "Whiplash."

Anyhow...

06:15.300 --> 06:17.133
I forgot
my insurance card,

06:17.133 --> 06:19.567
so I put the information
in this envelope form,

06:19.567 --> 06:22.000

I could tape it to your door.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.167
Why our door?

06:23.167 --> 06:24.400

I gave them your address.

12:52.400 --> 12:56.501
If they can't swim,
why do they come to the beach?

13:17.501 --> 13:20.000
I know that hand.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.501
Al? Al Bundy?

13:23.501 --> 13:24.968
Well, don't you
recognize me?

13:25.901 --> 13:27.834
Marilyn Beamis?

13:27.834 --> 13:29.267
Hey, it's been a lot of years.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.534
It sure has.

13:30.534 --> 13:31.667
You still look great, Al.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.801
You work out a lot?

13:32.801 --> 13:34.367
No, I barely eat.

13:35.834 --> 13:36.934
What you been up to?

13:36.934 --> 13:39.133
Well, I got married,
got divorced,

13:39.133 --> 13:40.300
had a couple of kids.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.667
In that order.
[LAUGHS]

13:42.667 --> 13:45.434
Uh, kids, listen,
be careful there.

13:45.434 --> 13:49.267
Don't get any sand
in the beer.

13:49.267 --> 13:50.267
You know,

13:50.267 --> 13:52.100
I think a lot about you, Al.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.734
Remember those nights
at the drive-in?

13:53.734 --> 13:56.334
Used to hide me
in the trunk of the car

13:56.334 --> 13:58.567
to save that dollar?

13:58.567 --> 14:01.634
And then it'd be
right from the trunk...

14:01.634 --> 14:03.300
into the back seat.
Remember, Al?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.501
[LAUGHS]

14:05.968 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, those were
the good old days.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.067
Oh, it's a nice day,
isn't it, Al?

14:12.067 --> 14:13.400
Yeah.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.367
Al...

14:15.367 --> 14:18.934
would you do me
a small favor?

14:18.934 --> 14:21.968
Would you make love to me
right here, right now?

14:25.501 --> 14:28.501
Well, uh, see, uh,
I'm married.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.868
Well, I don't care.

14:35.033 --> 14:37.868
Yeah, but she's, uh,
right here.

14:37.868 --> 14:39.434
[CHUCKLES]
Well, I don't care.

14:39.434 --> 14:41.334
It'll make it more exciting.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.868
Well, I'll send the kids
away if you want.

14:45.067 --> 14:46.734
[LAUGHS]

14:46.734 --> 14:48.200
Yeah, Marilyn,

14:48.200 --> 14:50.734
you always were one that
would go that extra mile,

14:50.734 --> 14:52.334
but, uh...

14:52.334 --> 14:53.901
I don't want this to get out,

14:53.901 --> 14:55.767
but, see, I really
kind of like my family.

14:55.767 --> 14:57.100
I don't think it'd be right.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.534
Now, don't feel insulted
or anything.

14:58.534 --> 15:01.567
I'd say the same thing
to my wife if she asked for sex.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.834
That's too bad, Al,

15:03.834 --> 15:06.200
because you are
and always will be

15:06.200 --> 15:08.834
the one man for me.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.100
Gary?

15:10.100 --> 15:12.567
Gary Cain,
you still look great.

15:12.567 --> 15:14.100
You work out a lot?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.300
Come on, kids.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.133
That's a real gold chain
he's wearing.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.534
Oh, I hate the beach.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.400
Ooh, ooh, oohhh...

15:31.000 --> 15:34.400
Beach-blanket bingo over here,
babycakes.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.234
Oh, hi, Steve.

15:38.234 --> 15:39.501
How was your swim?

15:39.501 --> 15:42.334
Well, the water's
a little polluted.

15:45.033 --> 15:46.834
But invigorating.

15:46.834 --> 15:47.834
Steve, you know,

15:47.834 --> 15:49.567
I just couldn't
take my eyes off you

15:49.567 --> 15:52.200
as you emerged
from the water.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.133
The sun glistening
off your powerful arms,

15:56.133 --> 15:58.033
your blond-- Uh...

15:58.033 --> 16:02.434
dark hair framing
your powerful shoulders.

16:02.434 --> 16:05.901
You move with the easy grace
of a jungle cat.

16:05.901 --> 16:07.701
[PURRS]

16:10.133 --> 16:12.234
Well, you know,
my parents toyed with the idea

16:12.234 --> 16:14.133
of naming me Tiger,

16:14.133 --> 16:16.367
but then the yellow went away,
and they went with Steve.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.000
Oh, God, it's
a beautiful day, isn't it?

16:21.000 --> 16:24.567
Oh, yes. And a perfect spot.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.367
Mother Nature,
this one's for you.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.434
[SCREAMS]

16:32.467 --> 16:34.901
With you?

16:34.901 --> 16:35.868
Ugh.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.067
[SNIFFLING]

16:46.300 --> 16:48.834
My bucket's broken.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.868
Take it easy.
I'll fix it for you.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.234
Thanks.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.300
You're my boyfriend.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.167
Great.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.300
Uh, excuse me.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.901
Hi there, I'm Bud.

17:09.901 --> 17:11.334
Bud, uh, Bon Jovi.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.300
We're doing
a rock video for MTV,

17:17.300 --> 17:19.133
and I think
you just got lucky.

17:19.133 --> 17:22.733
Really? I'd do anything
to be in a rock video.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.400
And so you shall.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.100
Boyfriend?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.467
Aren't you cute?

17:33.467 --> 17:34.934
He's mine.

17:35.634 --> 17:36.801
[GASPS]

17:38.534 --> 17:39.400
How dare you?!

17:45.400 --> 17:48.701
I love you, boyfriend.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.834
Want to play?

17:52.234 --> 17:54.701
Hi, cutie,
do you have the time?

17:54.701 --> 17:56.467
Not for you, tramp!

17:59.467 --> 18:00.834
How dare you?

18:09.367 --> 18:12.300
Boring?
Are you kidding?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.234
You are one of
the most interesting guys

18:14.234 --> 18:15.701
I have ever met.

18:15.701 --> 18:18.634
So tell me more
about your life's work.

18:18.634 --> 18:21.133
Well, my quest
for the perfect tan

18:21.133 --> 18:23.567
started when I was only 12.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.501
I came from
a poor family who, uh,

18:25.501 --> 18:28.801
couldn't afford a tan.

18:28.801 --> 18:31.167
Wow. You've overcome
so much.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.834
I love you.

18:43.434 --> 18:45.100
I give up.

18:45.100 --> 18:48.501
Look, I gotta go over
and talk to this girl.

18:48.501 --> 18:50.334
Don't worry,
she's my sister.

18:50.334 --> 18:52.334
Can I come with you,
boyfriend?

18:52.334 --> 18:53.667
Do I have a choice?

18:53.667 --> 18:55.501
No.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.968
It's like I'm married.

18:59.167 --> 19:02.434
Hey, Kel,
want to go for a Slurpee?

19:02.434 --> 19:03.467
Got one.

19:06.868 --> 19:10.434
So, Chris, wanna take me
for a ride in your Vette?

19:10.434 --> 19:11.767
I don't really feel like it.

19:13.901 --> 19:16.300
Hey, Chris, want to take me
for a ride in your 'Vette?

19:16.300 --> 19:17.167
Sure!

19:31.400 --> 19:33.601
Gee...alone, Kel?

19:33.601 --> 19:35.200
Yeah.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.067
Neither of us
did any good today.

19:37.067 --> 19:38.267
I guess the bet's off.

19:38.267 --> 19:39.734
Yeah.

19:39.734 --> 19:41.167
He's my boyfriend.

19:48.801 --> 19:50.367
[LAUGHS]

19:52.567 --> 19:53.634
What, Steve? What?

19:53.634 --> 19:55.167
Oh, just thinking
about that moron

19:55.167 --> 19:57.400
I smacked into today.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.467
I mean, he saw
our Mercedes,

19:59.467 --> 20:01.834
and yet he thought
we were as poor as he was.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.901
He was willing
to take 100 bucks.

20:03.901 --> 20:05.100
Did you see the fluids

20:05.100 --> 20:07.834
gushing out of
the bottom of his car?

20:07.834 --> 20:09.868
A hundred bucks!

20:11.801 --> 20:14.367
I kill me.

20:14.367 --> 20:15.334
Excuse me.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.834
Is this your Mercedes?

20:18.834 --> 20:21.801
Oh, Steve,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

20:21.801 --> 20:23.667
It's part of Klaus!

20:26.067 --> 20:27.434
By the way, uh,

20:27.434 --> 20:29.300
the guy with the sledgehammer
said your note--

20:29.300 --> 20:31.334
"Gone to the beach.
Ha ha, loser"--

20:31.334 --> 20:32.968
doesn't quite cover his damage.

20:32.968 --> 20:35.033
Have a nice day,

20:35.033 --> 20:36.133
and, uh...

20:36.133 --> 20:37.567
swim with a buddy.

20:57.067 --> 21:00.033
One stinkin' picture
with my stinkin' family,

21:00.033 --> 21:01.834
that's all I wanted.

21:01.834 --> 21:03.067
Nope.

21:03.067 --> 21:05.267
Too much for you, Bundy.

21:10.267 --> 21:13.000
Oh... Hi, honey.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.968
Gee, I guess
I fell asleep.

21:14.968 --> 21:16.133
I know.

21:16.133 --> 21:19.000
I was kinda hoping we could
go swimming together.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.167
I know.

21:20.167 --> 21:21.901
And, you know,
if you would have even

21:21.901 --> 21:25.400
laid a hand on that Marilyn,
I would've killed you.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.567
I know.

21:28.234 --> 21:29.534
I thought
you were sleeping.

21:29.534 --> 21:30.934
Aw, honey, you know
I can't sleep

21:30.934 --> 21:36.267
without my knee
in your back.

21:36.267 --> 21:37.868
But, you know, Al,
that was very sweet

21:37.868 --> 21:40.567
what you said
about liking your family.

21:40.567 --> 21:41.968
Of course, it would have
been sweeter

21:41.968 --> 21:43.801
if you'd said
that after your wife

21:43.801 --> 21:46.100
you were ruined
for all other women.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.067
Well, that's
actually true.

21:49.067 --> 21:51.634
Well, we're ready to go.

21:52.968 --> 21:55.067
Hey, wait a minute.

21:55.067 --> 21:57.834
What happened here?
Another kid?

21:59.467 --> 22:01.667
How long was I asleep?

22:03.100 --> 22:05.567
It's Bud's squeeze.

22:05.567 --> 22:08.033
We're gonna have to
have a little talk,

22:08.033 --> 22:09.834
me and you, young man.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.033
But not right now.

22:11.033 --> 22:12.300
Right now,
I want a picture.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.000
Kids, go over there
behind your mother.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.667
Little girl, little girl,

22:15.667 --> 22:17.868
could you stand over there
and take our picture?

22:21.000 --> 22:22.334
All right, now,

22:22.334 --> 22:24.200
pretend we're not
going home together.

22:25.934 --> 22:28.701
Oh, man, just the picture
I always wanted.
