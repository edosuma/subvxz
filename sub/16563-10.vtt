WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:04.490
You guys already have a menu
for Screwgies?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.366
Got to strike while the iron's hot.

00:06.402 --> 00:08.735
Come on, Blip. I want
to do this. I want to invest.

00:08.771 --> 00:11.167
Are we just gonna, like, put off
our plan to have another kid?

00:11.177 --> 00:12.940
It's not worth your time
and your energy.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.653
Amelia, that's my brother. I'll always

00:14.663 --> 00:16.543
have his back, so you need
to get on board with this.

00:16.578 --> 00:18.533
There's a big discrepancy here.
I mean, that's got to be some

00:18.543 --> 00:20.531
- kind of error.
- I set aside 40 grand.

00:20.541 --> 00:21.782
What about the other $32,000?

00:21.817 --> 00:22.916
Amelia,

00:22.951 --> 00:24.484
I need your help with something.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.786
We want you on the Cubs, Mike.

00:25.821 --> 00:27.554
And in exchange,
we want to get you that ring.

00:27.589 --> 00:30.090
When it's your time to lead,
you can do things differently.

00:30.125 --> 00:32.726
I hope you stay, Mike, but if
you don't, I'll do exactly that.

00:32.761 --> 00:34.261
I'm engaged.

00:34.296 --> 00:36.730
You like chasing. You don't like having.

00:36.765 --> 00:38.131
The second you get what you want,

00:38.167 --> 00:39.599
you figure out a way to throw it away.

00:39.635 --> 00:41.435
Uh, I'd love to take you to dinner.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.236
That's Noah Casey. He's basically

00:43.272 --> 00:44.905
the Mark Zuckerberg of mo-cap.

00:47.042 --> 00:48.809
I'm sorry, Noah. I-I got to go.

00:48.844 --> 00:50.377
Hey, Lawson.

00:55.984 --> 00:57.017
Okay.

00:57.052 --> 00:58.452
I'm not going anywhere.

00:58.487 --> 00:59.619
My trade fell through.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.047 --> 01:26.328
I don't even know what I'm rooting for.

01:26.338 --> 01:28.515
You're rooting for her to do it!
For her to throw a n...

01:28.550 --> 01:30.383
- Shh!
- Two outs here in the seventh.

01:30.419 --> 01:33.385
Baker looks in for the sign from Lawson.

01:33.395 --> 01:34.955
Amelia, where are you?

01:34.990 --> 01:37.592
- Ginny's pitching a n...
- Don't say it.

01:37.866 --> 01:39.526
A very nice game.

01:39.561 --> 01:41.161
Get over here.

01:42.217 --> 01:45.165
Here's the windup, the pitch.

01:45.824 --> 01:47.701
Salvamini has it.

01:47.736 --> 01:50.003
Got him!

01:50.038 --> 01:53.546
- She's through seven!
- Oh, my!

02:02.417 --> 02:04.518
Really? We're doing this?

02:04.553 --> 02:06.887
Sonny, come on, talk to me.

02:06.922 --> 02:09.556
Are you...? Dusty?

02:10.959 --> 02:12.359
Fine, be that way.

02:12.394 --> 02:13.760
Superstitious wimps.

02:13.795 --> 02:15.328
Okay, folks.

02:15.364 --> 02:17.330
Ginny Baker is now
through seven innings.

02:17.366 --> 02:18.999
We're gonna go to that broadcast live.

02:19.034 --> 02:21.067
Let's join Dick Enberg
and Mark Grant on the call.

02:21.103 --> 02:23.036
Really amazing stuff.

02:23.071 --> 02:26.119
If you're wondering why
Ginny Baker is on an island

02:26.129 --> 02:29.631
all by herself there, it's what
baseball tradition is all about.

02:29.641 --> 02:31.040
No one talks to her.

02:31.076 --> 02:33.243
No one can even mention the words.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.715
But with six outs

02:34.725 --> 02:38.456
to go, there's only one question
on everyone's mind.

02:38.466 --> 02:42.819
Is Ginny Baker
about to pitch a no-hitter?

02:44.456 --> 02:47.290
Oh, thank God.
If one more person ignores me,

02:47.325 --> 02:48.758
I'm gonna lose my damn mind.

02:48.793 --> 02:52.028
Oh, here you go. Hey, so I was...

02:53.598 --> 02:54.831
Really?

03:04.042 --> 03:06.372
_

03:23.168 --> 03:24.928
You weren't answering your cell.

03:24.963 --> 03:26.867
Uh, maybe because I was sleeping. I...

03:26.877 --> 03:29.666
Here. I've waited long
enough. I want details.

03:29.701 --> 03:31.100
Of what?

03:31.136 --> 03:32.163
Of what?

03:32.173 --> 03:33.910
The electoral map, Ginny.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.506
I want details from last night!

03:36.541 --> 03:38.955
I don't know. I-I think
it got a little weird.

03:38.965 --> 03:41.667
Oh. Like... like a
good kind of weird, or

03:41.677 --> 03:43.410
bad weird? Ooh, is he like

03:43.446 --> 03:45.769
a Fifty Shades of Grey type billionaire?

03:45.779 --> 03:48.332
Oh, Noah? No,
it didn't get weird with him.

03:48.342 --> 03:49.974
Well, who'd it get weird with?

03:50.177 --> 03:51.919
I'm too tired
to have this conversation...

03:51.954 --> 03:54.272
That's what the coffee's for. Spill.

03:54.282 --> 03:56.490
Seriously, spill, or I will.
I'm not even kidding.

03:56.525 --> 03:59.402
I left halfway through...

03:59.693 --> 04:02.429
- to go meet Mike.
- What?!

04:02.465 --> 04:03.998
I thought he was out with the guys, and,

04:04.033 --> 04:05.833
- you know, leaving for Chicago.
- What?

04:05.868 --> 04:07.701
Things got weird with Mike?!

04:07.737 --> 04:09.036
- No. It was...
- Well, how far did it go?

04:09.071 --> 04:11.438
What he...
Does the carpet match the face?

04:11.474 --> 04:14.141
Ew. No, it wasn't like that.

04:14.176 --> 04:16.043
It was... I can't talk about this.

04:16.077 --> 04:18.545
No, no, no, I think you
can, and I think you will.

04:18.581 --> 04:19.846
Now I want details.

04:19.882 --> 04:23.951
Vivid, electrifying, specific details.

04:24.048 --> 04:26.854
- Go.
- There was a hug.

04:26.889 --> 04:29.490
Ooh, ah, go on, go on, go on. Sorry.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.692
We were hugging good-bye,

04:31.727 --> 04:33.627
and there was... a moment.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.797
This intense, strange

04:36.832 --> 04:38.866
- moment.
- Say more words.

04:38.901 --> 04:41.068
And then Oscar called and...

04:41.103 --> 04:43.702
told Mike he wasn't being traded,

04:43.879 --> 04:46.407
- and that was that.
- Ginny, look at me. I am starving

04:46.442 --> 04:48.175
for sexual details
outside of my marriage.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.576
Now, I want nuance.

04:49.612 --> 04:51.178
Was there any brushing of the lips?

04:51.213 --> 04:53.881
- No. No.
- How close did you guys get?

04:53.916 --> 04:55.215
Did you feel his hot,
warm man breath on you?

04:55.251 --> 04:56.650
What is wrong with you? Can you back up?

04:56.686 --> 04:58.085
- Knock, knock.
- Come in.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.153
- This is so not over.
- Couldn't be more over.

05:02.265 --> 05:04.733
Hey. What's up?

05:04.743 --> 05:06.960
- Nothing.
- Everything.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.607
Hey, Beautiful Mind,
you mind telling me what's up?

05:15.676 --> 05:17.309
We need to shut Ginny down.

05:17.378 --> 05:20.812
Huh? Why? She's nowhere near
her innings limit.

05:20.881 --> 05:22.314
Yeah, or her pitch count. I know.

05:22.349 --> 05:24.316
But the screwball is a total variable.

05:24.385 --> 05:26.184
Plus, she throws it 48% of the time,

05:26.253 --> 05:27.786
which is more than seven percent higher

05:27.821 --> 05:29.521
than anybody else throws
their specialty pitch.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.524
By my estimation, she's actually
pitched 70 more innings

05:32.593 --> 05:33.959
than her stat sheet says she has,

05:34.028 --> 05:35.894
which puts her way over
her innings limit.

05:35.963 --> 05:38.497
- How sure are you about this?
- What, do you want a percentage?

05:38.566 --> 05:40.165
- I'd prefer words.
- Well, I'm better with percentages.

05:40.234 --> 05:41.900
- Ross.
- I'm pretty sure.

05:42.721 --> 05:45.070
Okay. A couple of things on the docket.

05:45.139 --> 05:46.505
You have the Rachel Patrick
interview today at Petco.

05:46.574 --> 05:47.847
Rachel Patrick?

05:47.857 --> 05:50.075
Ginny's doing an interview
with Mike's ex-wife?

05:50.144 --> 05:52.644
She's doing an interview
with a top journalist

05:52.713 --> 05:54.846
about her place in the
pantheon of female sports.

05:54.915 --> 05:57.249
She just happens to be Mike's ex-wife.

05:57.318 --> 05:59.518
She wasn't my first choice, either.

05:59.587 --> 06:01.086
I'm also shopping your memoirs.

06:01.155 --> 06:03.655
She's 23. Does she even have
memoirs yet?

06:03.724 --> 06:05.557
She's gonna find 'em in the off-season.

06:05.626 --> 06:08.193
And somebody is going to pay
you a lot of money to do it.

06:08.262 --> 06:10.662
Little girls are gonna eat it up.

06:10.698 --> 06:12.931
We also have to map out
your appearance schedule.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.435
Amelia, I've never had an off-season.

06:16.503 --> 06:19.905
You'll have a break.
A week, maybe even two.

06:19.974 --> 06:22.574
But we cannot take our foot
off the pedal right now.

06:22.610 --> 06:25.210
Everybody is waiting
to hear your message.

06:25.279 --> 06:26.878
We'll talk about it later.

06:26.947 --> 06:29.114
Hey, we'll talk
about that other stuff later.

06:29.183 --> 06:30.816
See you at the park.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.287
What's going on with
Will and the restaurant?

06:35.356 --> 06:37.122
I found out who cashed
those checks he wrote.

06:37.157 --> 06:38.924
Some businessman in Charlotte.

06:38.993 --> 06:40.577
So he definitely took the money.

06:41.603 --> 06:44.673
Amelia, I so don't want
to tell her, or confront him.

06:44.683 --> 06:47.284
You don't have to. I will.

06:47.352 --> 06:49.019
I'm not sure if that's such a good idea.

06:49.087 --> 06:50.454
I know how to speak to Will.

06:50.522 --> 06:52.255
Besides, it's my job.

07:04.026 --> 07:05.694
Yeah, we're not doing that.

07:10.008 --> 07:12.108
- This seat taken?
- I knew you wouldn't leave.

07:12.177 --> 07:15.645
I knew when push came to shove,
you couldn't flip on Blip.

07:15.714 --> 07:17.113
Yeah.

07:17.149 --> 07:18.415
What?

07:18.484 --> 07:19.783
Nothing.

07:20.759 --> 07:23.192
It was you that called
the trade off, right?

07:23.202 --> 07:24.387
That's what they said.

07:24.456 --> 07:26.656
Well, they say a lot of things.

07:26.725 --> 07:28.225
So, it wasn't your call?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.329
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:32.339 --> 07:33.630
You're back, obviously.

07:33.699 --> 07:34.998
Yeah.

07:37.202 --> 07:40.203
So, uh, uh... about last night,
we don't need to...

07:40.272 --> 07:42.472
- No. No, definitely not.
- So...

07:42.541 --> 07:44.674
- Yeah. Good.
- Good.

07:47.712 --> 07:49.246
Oh. I'm doing an interview

07:49.314 --> 07:51.147
- with your ex-wife today.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

07:51.216 --> 07:52.616
I talked to the producer about you.

07:53.028 --> 07:54.520
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

07:55.446 --> 07:56.920
So...

07:57.322 --> 07:58.688
- We're good?
- The best.

07:58.724 --> 08:00.857
- Good.
- Good.

08:01.551 --> 08:03.466
- Hey, Ginny, are you...?
- I'm good!

08:13.700 --> 08:15.950
So, you didn't call off the trade.

08:16.825 --> 08:18.449
I'm back, aren't I?

08:18.687 --> 08:20.396
Yeah, but for how long?

08:21.580 --> 08:24.147
Mike, need to talk to you.

08:26.727 --> 08:28.067
What's going on?

08:28.077 --> 08:31.054
I got a recommendation from
analytics to shut Ginny down.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.256
- When?
- Right away.

08:33.267 --> 08:34.491
- Why?
- Exactly.

08:34.559 --> 08:36.226
They're concerned about wear and tear.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.128
Nice of those guys to do my job for me.

08:38.196 --> 08:42.232
Do those geniuses notice that
her velocity's exactly the same?

08:42.267 --> 08:44.000
Yes, but apparently, her RPMs are lower.

08:44.068 --> 08:46.403
So is my nut sack. Doesn't stop me

08:46.438 --> 08:47.837
from getting out of bed in the morning.

08:47.873 --> 08:50.006
Well, sometimes it does stop him

08:50.075 --> 08:51.719
from getting out of bed in the morning.

08:51.729 --> 08:53.843
Mike, I want to hear
your opinion as her catcher.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.845
As her catcher?

08:55.914 --> 08:57.847
Well, as her catcher,
I think that you should tell her

08:57.916 --> 08:59.549
that her season's over,
let her wrap her mind

08:59.618 --> 09:01.151
around that for a few days, and then

09:01.219 --> 09:03.019
tell all the fans about it, and then

09:03.055 --> 09:05.135
change your mind. You seem
to be really good at that.

09:05.696 --> 09:06.890
Mike, this is not about you.

09:07.407 --> 09:09.401
I just want to know what you
think about shutting her down.

09:09.411 --> 09:11.227
Okay. Well, I think she's
nowhere near her innings limit,

09:11.263 --> 09:12.762
she lost her last start
in a heartbreaker,

09:12.831 --> 09:14.364
and it'd be a terrible way
to end her season.

09:14.433 --> 09:15.732
That's what I think.

09:15.742 --> 09:18.093
- Amen to that.
- Hmm.

09:18.103 --> 09:20.270
Anybody interested in my
opinion? 'Cause I happen to be

09:20.339 --> 09:22.505
the only one who's actually
played a season with her

09:22.574 --> 09:24.974
- and watched her pitch in September.
- And?

09:24.984 --> 09:28.712
Honestly, she kind of ran out of gas.

09:28.780 --> 09:30.513
She overcomes a lot with hard work,

09:30.582 --> 09:31.881
but she definitely wore down,

09:31.950 --> 09:34.017
so if it were up to me, and I'm thinking

09:34.086 --> 09:36.419
about what's best
for the team long-term, then...

09:37.506 --> 09:40.090
I'd shut her down.
Then again, maybe some of us

09:40.158 --> 09:43.026
don't care about what's best
for the team long-term anymore.

09:43.095 --> 09:45.595
That's just one man's opinion.

09:50.102 --> 09:51.735
I happen to agree with him.

09:52.970 --> 09:55.164
Then we got nothing else to discuss.

09:55.174 --> 09:57.307
Yeah.

10:01.380 --> 10:03.146
Your tie is weird.

10:07.560 --> 10:09.285
Congratulations.
You just ended her season.

10:09.354 --> 10:12.004
I'm looking out for her.

10:16.381 --> 10:18.828
- What's going on?
- They're shutting you down.

10:28.634 --> 10:29.767
Why are you shutting me down?

10:29.836 --> 10:31.211
Who said anything
about shutting you down?

10:31.221 --> 10:33.104
We need to shut Ginny down.

10:33.139 --> 10:35.072
I'm supposed to have three more starts.

10:35.141 --> 10:36.741
Hey, Ross, can you get in here, please?

10:36.809 --> 10:39.410
I don't understand. I haven't even
reached my innings limit yet.

10:39.479 --> 10:41.479
Exactly. I thought we were gonna
shut her down in mid-September.

10:41.547 --> 10:43.544
I know how my arm feels.
It feels as good as it looks.

10:43.554 --> 10:46.817
- Ross! Hey, give 'em the numbers.
- Hi. Big fan.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.291
Ross, numbers now.

10:48.301 --> 10:50.087
Ginny throws her screwball
48% of the time.

10:50.156 --> 10:52.089
There were four other guys
who threw that percentage

10:52.158 --> 10:54.225
of off-speed pitches last season.

10:54.293 --> 10:55.659
- Guess which list they're on now.
- I'm telling you,

10:55.728 --> 10:56.649
- I feel fine.
- Yes,

10:56.659 --> 10:58.496
because you're a gamer,
and we know this.

10:58.564 --> 10:59.764
But wouldn't you rather
sit out a few games

10:59.832 --> 11:00.998
in September than all of next season

11:01.067 --> 11:02.500
because of Tommy John surgery?

11:02.568 --> 11:04.602
Okay, wait, there's
got to be a compromise here.

11:04.670 --> 11:06.070
There's also the strain
of the screwball itself.

11:06.105 --> 11:07.772
Ross, I can't tell you how much

11:07.840 --> 11:09.240
I appreciate your dedication.

11:09.308 --> 11:10.841
Thank you. See, the issue...

11:10.910 --> 11:12.176
This is the point where
you stop talking.

11:12.245 --> 11:13.244
- Gotcha.
- I've consulted

11:13.312 --> 11:14.612
- with various people...
- Right.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.980
Of course, none of them was me.

11:16.048 --> 11:17.181
Did any of them mention that

11:17.250 --> 11:18.616
women's ligaments
are different than men's,

11:18.684 --> 11:21.164
that there's a different laxity
that gives us more flexibility?

11:22.926 --> 11:24.121
- It doesn't change the numbers.
- All right,

11:24.190 --> 11:26.090
look, well, we're sold out
tomorrow, so either way,

11:26.125 --> 11:28.125
she has to have one more start.

11:29.771 --> 11:31.629
Wow. Okay, limited innings.

11:31.664 --> 11:34.076
One more start. Make the most of it.

11:39.539 --> 11:41.705
Look, I know this comes as a blow,

11:41.774 --> 11:43.340
but we've gotten everything
we could have asked for

11:43.409 --> 11:44.475
out of this season.

11:44.544 --> 11:45.976
- I haven't.
- Just...

11:46.045 --> 11:47.378
look at the position we're in.

11:47.447 --> 11:51.382
This actually gives us more time to focus
on the things we want in the off-season.

11:51.451 --> 11:54.151
Like launching a certain restaurant.

11:56.522 --> 12:00.357
Good to see you both are so
focused on my needs right now.

12:02.946 --> 12:05.062
G. G, hold up.

12:05.131 --> 12:08.381
I know there's money missing
from the restaurant fund.

12:14.418 --> 12:15.673
I already told Evelyn...

12:15.741 --> 12:17.641
I know what you told Evelyn.
Don't even bother

12:17.710 --> 12:19.863
telling it to me. I know it's a lie.

12:20.242 --> 12:22.377
Either you tell Ginny or I will.

12:27.487 --> 12:30.020
For the first few weeks of
your Major League career,

12:30.056 --> 12:32.562
it seemed like everything
you did made history.

12:32.572 --> 12:34.391
Now, 15 starts later...

12:34.460 --> 12:36.560
where do you see your place in history?

12:36.629 --> 12:38.696
- I... I can't answer that.
- Are you

12:38.764 --> 12:40.764
in the same conversation
as Serena Williams

12:40.833 --> 12:42.099
and Katie Ledecky?

12:42.168 --> 12:44.086
They've won a lot more than I have.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.403
- Competing against women.
- Maybe I just belong

12:46.472 --> 12:49.507
in a conversation with
Blake Snell and Michael Fulmer.

12:49.575 --> 12:52.610
- Two other 23-year-old rookie pitchers.
- Well, is that how

12:52.678 --> 12:53.944
your teammates view you now?

12:54.013 --> 12:55.679
Just as another ballplayer?

12:55.748 --> 12:57.648
Or do they still think of you
as a woman?

12:59.085 --> 13:03.287
I like to think a little...
less every day.

13:03.322 --> 13:06.022
- Mm, thank you.
- Oh, God, thank you.

13:06.032 --> 13:07.258
I feel like I was here at the beginning.

13:07.326 --> 13:08.893
It's nice to have a bookend.

13:12.064 --> 13:14.698
Just because you're not moving
doesn't mean we can't see you.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.301
No, I j...
I just didn't want to interrupt.

13:17.370 --> 13:19.236
- The interview's over.
- Oh.

13:19.305 --> 13:21.205
I'd ask you what
it felt like to be grilled

13:21.274 --> 13:23.219
by her, but I'm all too familiar.

13:23.404 --> 13:24.775
Actually, it wasn't so bad.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.877
Really? Find that hard to believe.

13:26.946 --> 13:29.313
Well, her answers were
way better than yours.

13:29.382 --> 13:31.982
So, what do you guys do now?

13:32.051 --> 13:33.484
You have a postgame ritual?

13:33.553 --> 13:34.952
Grab a beer?

13:35.446 --> 13:36.954
- No, I actually need to...
- No.

13:37.023 --> 13:38.989
- Did you... did you need...
- No, I'm good.

13:39.058 --> 13:40.418
- Good.
- You good?

13:40.428 --> 13:41.659
- I'm good.
- Good.

13:42.895 --> 13:44.662
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

13:44.730 --> 13:46.630
- See you.
- She's great.

13:46.699 --> 13:48.465
You didn't have to use
a cattle prod on her?

13:48.534 --> 13:50.134
Nope. She's much more
well behaved than you are.

13:50.202 --> 13:51.902
I miss the cattle prod.

13:51.938 --> 13:54.338
- Yeah, I know you do.
- Hmm, let me guess...

14:16.723 --> 14:19.430
- Thanks for talking to my producer, too.
- Oh. Well, I thought

14:19.498 --> 14:22.032
it meant I was going
to avoid talking to you.

14:25.242 --> 14:26.971
- I'm glad we can be like this.
- Yeah.

14:27.006 --> 14:28.872
I just want it to be normal. You know...

14:28.941 --> 14:31.442
I just want you to be happy, Rach.

14:31.477 --> 14:35.268
That's all I've ever wanted,
and if David makes you happy...

14:35.585 --> 14:36.981
We broke up.

14:39.452 --> 14:40.818
A few weeks ago.

14:44.053 --> 14:45.183
Um...

14:45.297 --> 14:46.724
okay, well, I, um,

14:47.088 --> 14:49.383
I should go start my edit.

14:56.275 --> 14:57.722
Ah. You're, uh,

14:57.757 --> 15:00.024
- you're heading off?
- Yeah. You want something?

15:00.059 --> 15:01.792
No, no, no, I don't want to keep you.

15:01.861 --> 15:02.994
Beer?

15:04.030 --> 15:05.630
Sure.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.944
Thanks.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.372
Al, I think I lost the team.

15:15.322 --> 15:18.177
The way I handled leaving.

15:18.848 --> 15:20.912
Okaying the trade to the Cubs.

15:21.639 --> 15:23.180
Even Blip is pissed at me.

15:23.249 --> 15:25.216
Yeah, you kind of kicked
the hell out of that one.

15:25.285 --> 15:26.717
But you'll get 'em back.

15:26.786 --> 15:28.753
- Especially Blip.
- I don't know.

15:28.788 --> 15:30.554
I'm very good at ruining a good thing.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.857
Everything can be going
along smoothly, and then

15:32.926 --> 15:35.259
I manage to do the wrong thing or...

15:35.328 --> 15:38.162
- not say the right thing.
- Well,

15:38.231 --> 15:41.232
you're a curmudgeon-y,
moody, cranky son of a bitch.

15:43.579 --> 15:46.092
Thank you. I learned from the best.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.273
But you got a marshmallow center.

15:50.440 --> 15:54.352
I know one thing, Mike. You didn't
want to leave us; you wanted to stay.

15:54.784 --> 15:56.914
Cubs, they were like the new girl...

15:56.983 --> 15:59.116
the one makes you laugh and...

15:59.185 --> 16:00.584
feel young.

16:01.595 --> 16:04.689
And she distracted you
from what you really wanted.

16:04.757 --> 16:07.191
You went there in a moment of weakness.

16:08.761 --> 16:11.019
But this is where your heart is.

16:11.398 --> 16:13.998
You came back. That's
all that really matters.

16:17.197 --> 16:19.685
Besides, the Cubs'll never win it.

16:19.695 --> 16:20.771
Yeah.

16:22.809 --> 16:24.208
You got something?

16:24.277 --> 16:25.876
I just started.

16:25.945 --> 16:28.079
I bailed on him on our first date,

16:28.114 --> 16:30.881
and I texted him, and...
now he's not replying.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.984
Ginny, you just asked me to locate a guy

16:33.052 --> 16:35.419
that didn't reply to a text
20 minutes ago.

16:35.488 --> 16:36.842
I can't just find him just...

16:36.852 --> 16:38.622
Mm... huh.

16:39.509 --> 16:41.036
I know where he is.

16:42.395 --> 16:44.895
It's a little weird
going on your date with you.

16:44.964 --> 16:46.230
It's not a date.

16:46.299 --> 16:49.175
Right now it's... semi-stalking.

16:49.448 --> 16:51.068
You sure this is where he said he'd be?

16:51.137 --> 16:52.236
This is what he posted.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.481
Oh, my God.

17:44.532 --> 17:46.358
Thank you guys. Thank you.

17:48.594 --> 17:50.086
- What?!
- What are you doing here?

17:50.351 --> 17:52.029
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

17:52.065 --> 17:54.829
And where do you get off
singing like that?

17:55.006 --> 17:56.731
Can I get you a drink?

17:57.243 --> 18:00.171
- Can I get you a drink?
- Okay. This is now a date.

18:00.239 --> 18:02.983
I will see myself out.

18:07.527 --> 18:08.846
How do you even...

18:08.915 --> 18:11.182
how do you even become,
like, the first female

18:11.250 --> 18:12.983
Major League Baseball player?

18:13.052 --> 18:16.687
My father... would always say to me,

18:16.722 --> 18:19.895
the three most important words are

18:20.098 --> 18:22.226
"endure, endure, endure."

18:22.295 --> 18:24.562
So I could get my screwball down,

18:24.630 --> 18:27.098
my control down, my mechanics down,

18:27.166 --> 18:31.102
but the ability to endure
whatever was thrown at me

18:31.170 --> 18:33.871
was going to be what...
you know, got me to the bigs.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.631
So, what about you?

18:35.966 --> 18:39.657
How does somebody become
a billionaire in his 20s?

18:39.896 --> 18:42.413
- How is that possible?
- Oh, man.

18:42.482 --> 18:45.616
Well, step one...

18:46.436 --> 18:48.052
inherit a billion dollars.

18:48.121 --> 18:50.020
- Really?
- No. God. If only.

18:50.089 --> 18:51.455
No, I was lucky 'cause I failed

18:51.524 --> 18:53.457
a lot before anybody knew who I was.

18:53.526 --> 18:56.613
I started five companies
before this one.

18:56.623 --> 18:58.963
At the other companies, I had all
these people looking out for me.

18:59.031 --> 19:00.698
All older, more experienced,

19:00.766 --> 19:02.533
all with the best of intentions.

19:02.602 --> 19:05.369
- Sounds familiar.
- And I didn't want to hurt them

19:05.438 --> 19:06.704
or make any waves, so...

19:06.772 --> 19:09.240
I'd weigh in, but basically,
I just let them call the shots.

19:09.308 --> 19:11.442
Then I had this epiphany one day.

19:11.477 --> 19:12.810
I just realized...

19:13.644 --> 19:16.313
I'm not letting them run things
because I don't want to make waves;

19:16.382 --> 19:18.315
I'm letting them run things

19:18.384 --> 19:22.274
because I'm scared of doing
things my own way and failing.

19:22.284 --> 19:24.221
But, of course, I was failing anyway.

19:24.257 --> 19:25.823
There had to be one voice,

19:25.858 --> 19:27.658
my voice.

19:27.727 --> 19:29.760
So...

19:29.795 --> 19:31.662
I did the thing that...

19:31.731 --> 19:33.664
scared me the most.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.710
You started calling the shots.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.316
No.

19:38.975 --> 19:40.449
I wrote a song...

19:41.216 --> 19:44.608
and I grabbed my guitar and
I went to this... open mic

19:44.677 --> 19:46.810
at a super hipster coffee shop,

19:46.879 --> 19:49.346
and, holy hell, I sucked...

19:49.415 --> 19:52.449
so bad, but I did it.

19:52.485 --> 19:55.789
And the very next day
I started my sixth company.

19:55.799 --> 19:57.521
It was just me.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.523
And this amazing
support system around me,

19:59.592 --> 20:02.226
but just... me.

20:05.264 --> 20:08.659
That's how you become a
billionaire in your 20s, Ginny.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.669
You stand in the center
of your scariest stage,

20:11.737 --> 20:13.871
you sing your song.

20:15.233 --> 20:18.309
What if your song is "Uptown Funk"?

20:18.377 --> 20:20.477
(A) Cool.

20:20.546 --> 20:23.447
(B) You just do what I did...
You just... keep singing

20:23.516 --> 20:25.216
till you don't suck anymore.

20:31.257 --> 20:32.890
I got to get home.

20:32.959 --> 20:34.559
Oh. All right.

20:35.147 --> 20:36.851
- This was fun.
- Yeah.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.095
Yeah.

20:38.192 --> 20:39.463
Okay, see you.

20:44.604 --> 20:46.904
I just forgot one little...

20:55.448 --> 20:58.643
Babe Didrikson
Zaharias... Althea Gibson...

20:58.653 --> 21:00.050
Serena Williams.

21:00.119 --> 21:01.418
Whether Ginny Baker takes her place

21:01.487 --> 21:02.987
in the pantheon beside them,

21:03.055 --> 21:05.155
or proves herself to be
a short-term anomaly,

21:05.224 --> 21:06.724
only time will tell,

21:06.792 --> 21:09.026
but either way,
as she makes her final start

21:09.095 --> 21:10.828
of this remarkable season,

21:10.896 --> 21:14.164
it is clear that she's already
made her mark on history.

22:34.998 --> 22:36.781
Ah, damn it.

22:36.791 --> 22:38.236
I wanted to wake you up with coffee,

22:38.246 --> 22:39.678
but this hotel coffee maker

22:39.747 --> 22:42.381
is... no.

22:42.416 --> 22:44.783
- Good mornin'.
- Hi.

22:44.852 --> 22:46.452
Okay.

22:46.487 --> 22:49.288
Here's the part where I creep
you out by moving too fast.

22:49.357 --> 22:50.422
You ready?

22:50.491 --> 22:51.790
- Ready.
- Okay.

22:51.859 --> 22:54.560
I know you got a break coming up.

22:54.629 --> 22:57.174
I think we should go on vacation.

22:57.422 --> 23:00.299
Okay. I have a plane and I have a boat.

23:00.368 --> 23:02.067
I'm not bragging,
I just want you to know

23:02.136 --> 23:03.702
all the options here.
Also, I'm bragging.

23:03.771 --> 23:05.971
- Is it working?
- I can't tell; I'm still half asleep.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.373
That's all right.
Okay, hear me out here.

23:07.408 --> 23:09.742
You know where paparazzi
can't get to us?

23:09.777 --> 23:12.645
A remote island in the middle
of the South Pacific.

23:12.713 --> 23:15.281
Or on top of Mount Everest
if that's more your thing.

23:15.349 --> 23:17.016
You come on really strong.

23:17.051 --> 23:19.818
Like my coffee, which I
promise I can make for you

23:19.854 --> 23:23.122
anywhere in the world
except this hotel room.

23:23.191 --> 23:25.891
- So where are we going?
- Hold on. Even, even if

23:25.960 --> 23:27.993
I wanted to go somewhere
with you on your plane...

23:28.029 --> 23:29.328
Or boat. I've also got a boat.

23:29.397 --> 23:30.663
That has to be said.

23:30.731 --> 23:33.265
I wouldn't even know
where to begin. I've...

23:33.334 --> 23:35.634
I've hardly been anywhere.

23:40.208 --> 23:42.608
Then let's go everywhere.

23:45.213 --> 23:48.147
Okay. If you'll go and get me
some coffee downstairs,

23:48.216 --> 23:49.782
I'll consider it.

23:53.530 --> 23:56.455
Did I screw things up for you?

23:56.524 --> 23:58.524
By coming over that night?

23:58.534 --> 24:00.136
No.

24:00.595 --> 24:03.929
But you did get me thinking.

24:03.998 --> 24:05.698
I just... I finally had to face the fact

24:05.766 --> 24:08.200
that I really, really liked him.

24:10.037 --> 24:12.270
I just didn't love him.

24:15.209 --> 24:17.142
I'm sorry.

24:17.211 --> 24:18.544
Thanks.

24:18.613 --> 24:20.802
For lying about being sorry?

24:30.024 --> 24:32.157
I got to get to the park.

24:33.694 --> 24:36.495
Oh, and just for the record,
I'm not bailing on you.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.030
I'm not making a run for it

24:38.099 --> 24:39.531
because I got you last night.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.033
There's actually a previously scheduled

24:41.068 --> 24:44.637
Major League Baseball game
that everyone knows about.

24:44.705 --> 24:45.971
Duly noted.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.072
I could leave a ticket
for you if you want.

24:47.141 --> 24:48.407
I have a press pass.

24:48.476 --> 24:50.909
I could leave a ticket for you, anyway.

24:52.683 --> 24:54.297
Yeah. Um...

24:55.650 --> 24:58.550
I don't know if that's such a good idea.

25:00.311 --> 25:02.354
I-I got to get back to L.A.

25:02.390 --> 25:03.889
Mm-hmm.

25:03.924 --> 25:06.191
Yeah, right.

25:06.227 --> 25:07.559
Okay.

25:10.332 --> 25:11.664
I'll see ya.

25:11.806 --> 25:13.699
See ya.

25:37.658 --> 25:39.958
Are we out any money?

25:39.994 --> 25:42.394
No. I think I caught it in time.

25:42.463 --> 25:43.696
Wow.

25:43.764 --> 25:45.030
Does Ginny know?

25:45.099 --> 25:46.598
No. Amelia's gonna tell her.

25:48.436 --> 25:50.235
I am so sorry, Evy.

25:50.304 --> 25:53.038
'Cause I know how excited you
were about this restaurant.

25:53.107 --> 25:55.374
Can I be honest, though?

25:55.443 --> 25:57.643
There's a part of me that's relieved.

25:57.712 --> 26:00.813
I don't want to postpone
having another kid.

26:00.881 --> 26:02.114
The boys are almost eight.

26:02.183 --> 26:04.416
They need a little brother or a sister.

26:05.192 --> 26:09.054
I mean, picture a little beautiful
version of you running around.

26:09.123 --> 26:12.091
Y'all can have matching outfits
going on spa days together.

26:12.159 --> 26:14.560
That'd be beautiful.

26:14.628 --> 26:17.963
Baby, come on. Let's...
let's get back to plan "A."

26:18.032 --> 26:19.898
Well, plan "A" was for me

26:19.967 --> 26:22.568
to graduate college
with a business degree.

26:22.636 --> 26:24.870
Not leave after sophomore year.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.472
I need to do something for me now.

26:26.540 --> 26:29.352
- Then we'll postpone...
- No, babe, you're not hearing me.

26:31.512 --> 26:35.147
I think I'm done having kids.

26:37.463 --> 26:39.585
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

26:39.653 --> 26:41.186
I still want to open this restaurant.

26:41.255 --> 26:43.021
I've done the legwork;
I've got the connections.

26:43.090 --> 26:45.515
I can do this without Will.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.279
What is wrong with people?

26:47.782 --> 26:51.718
Since when did everybody stop
caring about the way I feel?

26:52.362 --> 26:53.866
I don't think

26:53.934 --> 26:55.634
a restaurant is a good idea.

26:55.703 --> 26:59.104
Okay, Blip, I'm doing this,

26:59.173 --> 27:01.206
so you better get your head
around it, because the next time

27:01.275 --> 27:03.842
I bring this up, I want
my husband to support me

27:03.911 --> 27:06.278
the same way I've supported him
these past nine years:

27:06.347 --> 27:08.781
unconditionally and without hesitation.

27:08.849 --> 27:10.649
That's the kind
of response I'm looking for

27:10.718 --> 27:13.085
the next time we speak on this.

27:16.724 --> 27:18.657
And yeah.

27:18.726 --> 27:20.325
- Oh, stop.
- Yes.

27:20.394 --> 27:22.194
- I knew you were gonna cheat.
- I won. You take the "L."

27:22.229 --> 27:23.996
Here, give me this.

27:24.064 --> 27:27.065
Hey, um... listen.

27:27.134 --> 27:29.535
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

27:29.603 --> 27:30.836
What's up?

27:30.871 --> 27:32.070
It's Amelia.

27:33.001 --> 27:34.306
What about her?

27:34.341 --> 27:35.874
I don't know what it is,

27:35.943 --> 27:38.177
but I think she's got it in for me.

27:38.212 --> 27:40.679
You would think
I took you away from her,

27:40.748 --> 27:42.381
and not the other way around.

27:42.450 --> 27:43.816
What's going on, Will?

27:43.884 --> 27:45.250
Nothing.

27:45.319 --> 27:47.319
She just has it in her mind

27:47.388 --> 27:49.988
there's money missing
from the restaurant account.

27:50.024 --> 27:52.524
Now, I explained it to Evelyn.
She's fine with it,

27:52.593 --> 27:54.026
but then Amelia got in my face...

27:54.094 --> 27:55.160
What? She got... when?

27:55.196 --> 27:56.228
Yesterday.

27:56.297 --> 27:59.164
She said that I had to tell you

27:59.200 --> 28:02.081
I'm stealing money from you,
or she would.

28:02.870 --> 28:04.013
Are you?

28:04.023 --> 28:05.704
No, I'm not stealing money from you.

28:05.773 --> 28:07.072
Like I explained to Evelyn,

28:07.141 --> 28:09.708
I put some money aside for promotions.

28:09.777 --> 28:12.340
Got this sick deal on kitchen equipment.

28:12.350 --> 28:15.080
- Kitchen equipment?
- Yeah.

28:18.319 --> 28:20.285
You have receipts.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.555
Really? Of course I have the receipts.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.257
What kind of question is that?

28:26.291 --> 28:28.193
You're lying, Will.

28:28.262 --> 28:31.283
You've been lying since you got
here. What's going on?

28:33.100 --> 28:35.952
- Will. Tell me.
- I got in some trouble.

28:35.962 --> 28:37.655
All right?

28:38.806 --> 28:40.873
I had to borrow money
for the coffee shop.

28:40.941 --> 28:42.140
I couldn't pay it back,

28:42.209 --> 28:44.243
so I took just a little bit

28:44.311 --> 28:45.744
of money out of the restaurant fund

28:45.813 --> 28:48.614
to take care of it,
and now I have, okay?

28:48.682 --> 28:51.583
And look, I will pay you back
every bit of it

28:51.652 --> 28:53.285
when the restaurant starts rolling.

28:53.354 --> 28:55.387
That's so crazy, all
you had to do was ask.

28:55.456 --> 28:57.256
- I was ashamed, don't you understand?
- No, Will.

28:57.324 --> 28:59.892
I don't understand.
You asked for a chance,

28:59.960 --> 29:02.895
I gave it to you, and you stole from me.

29:02.963 --> 29:04.663
That's what I understand.

29:04.698 --> 29:06.231
From now on, no more lies.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.100
No, stop.

29:11.472 --> 29:13.230
You got to go home, Will.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.908
I wouldn't be doing you any favors
by letting you open a restaurant

29:15.976 --> 29:17.509
with my name on it.

29:17.519 --> 29:19.678
- You need to find your own path.
- There's no reason...

29:19.747 --> 29:21.680
No. Will. I'm out.

29:21.749 --> 29:24.049
I'm telling you, I'm out.

29:25.152 --> 29:26.618
Go home.

29:26.687 --> 29:27.953
Find my brother.

29:28.022 --> 29:30.289
I miss him.

29:30.357 --> 29:31.757
When you do,

29:31.825 --> 29:34.760
I will support you all the way,
you know that.

29:35.622 --> 29:36.929
Okay.

29:36.997 --> 29:39.831
Well, when I do,

29:39.900 --> 29:42.334
I won't need your support.

29:52.806 --> 29:55.210
Look at this one.
They're going in for a smooch.

29:55.245 --> 29:57.125
Ooh... Hey!

29:59.149 --> 30:00.449
It's about damn time.

30:00.484 --> 30:02.117
You had us all worried.
I thought we were gonna

30:02.186 --> 30:04.052
have to take you to
some Magic Mike-type place,

30:04.121 --> 30:06.088
- or something like that.
- Hey, Lawson, check it out.

30:06.156 --> 30:08.177
Ginny finally got some.

30:08.187 --> 30:10.425
- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Wow.

30:10.494 --> 30:12.628
Nice, Baker.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.297
- Good for you.
- Hmm.

30:22.658 --> 30:23.954
Hey.

30:23.964 --> 30:26.241
- I'm sorry about that.
- What are you apologizing for?

30:26.276 --> 30:30.579
It just feels weird, you seeing pictures
of me on a date after the other night.

30:30.648 --> 30:32.581
I thought we didn't need
to talk about that.

30:32.650 --> 30:34.231
I didn't think so either,

30:34.241 --> 30:35.784
but, I don't know, maybe we should.

30:35.853 --> 30:37.586
About what? The fact that two teammates

30:37.655 --> 30:38.920
went out for a drink
because they thought

30:38.989 --> 30:40.088
that one of them was getting traded,

30:40.157 --> 30:41.490
and then he ended up not getting traded?

30:41.558 --> 30:43.492
'Cause... 'cause that's what happened.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.094
- That's what happened?
- That's what happened.

30:46.964 --> 30:49.464
I guess we don't need to talk about it.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.010
Want to grab a bite after?

31:02.079 --> 31:03.686
There's a new place
just opened by my house.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.516
Can't. I got to get home,
deal with some stuff with Ev.

31:06.526 --> 31:08.017
Everything all right?

31:15.559 --> 31:17.659
Just came to check on you.

31:17.728 --> 31:19.494
Is there anything you need
before you start your routine?

31:19.563 --> 31:20.962
Nope.

31:21.031 --> 31:23.298
All right.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.866
I'll see you later.

31:24.935 --> 31:26.735
Yep.

31:27.789 --> 31:30.677
- Have a great start.
- Why would you interfere?

31:31.021 --> 31:32.211
What?

31:32.221 --> 31:34.609
Will's gone; he told me about the money.

31:35.646 --> 31:37.646
Why would you interfere?

31:39.783 --> 31:41.216
I'm sorry.

31:41.285 --> 31:44.086
I specifically asked you
to stay away from him.

31:44.154 --> 31:45.921
To stay out of my family business.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.556
I specifically asked you to do that.

31:47.624 --> 31:48.990
Let's talk about this after the game.

31:49.059 --> 31:51.193
No, Amelia, we're gonna
talk about it right now.

31:51.261 --> 31:53.395
- He was going to pull you down.
- So he would

31:53.464 --> 31:55.330
have pulled me down, and I
would have learned from it.

31:55.365 --> 31:56.531
It's my job to make sure
that you don't have to

31:56.600 --> 31:57.933
- learn from it.
- Your job

31:58.001 --> 32:00.168
is to take ten percent of my income

32:00.237 --> 32:02.904
and do what I ask you to do.

32:02.973 --> 32:04.906
- That's your job.
- When are you gonna realize

32:04.975 --> 32:07.542
once and for all,
that it's not all about you?

32:07.578 --> 32:09.347
Oh, God, Amelia, I know,
you're a broken record.

32:09.357 --> 32:10.512
If I go down, what?

32:10.581 --> 32:11.880
- Go ahead, finish it, finish it.
- If you go down...

32:11.915 --> 32:13.381
If you go down, everything

32:13.450 --> 32:15.645
that you represent goes down.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.253
If I hadn't come along when I did...

32:18.322 --> 32:20.055
If you hadn't come along when you did,

32:20.124 --> 32:22.958
I would be exactly where I am today.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.259
And probably happier.

32:24.328 --> 32:26.795
And what female MLB pitcher would
you be representing right now?

32:26.864 --> 32:28.917
Huh, Amelia? What pitcher?

32:28.927 --> 32:32.067
You know, I take
this crap from you, Ginny.

32:32.514 --> 32:36.104
I take it from you
and I take it from you,

32:36.173 --> 32:39.141
- and I'm not gonna take it much more.
- Then don't.

32:42.931 --> 32:44.913
You know, one day,

32:44.982 --> 32:46.915
you're gonna regret this.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.753
One day, you're gonna
be at your lowest point

32:51.822 --> 32:54.422
and you're gonna look up
and you're gonna need someone.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.958
And it's not gonna be your dead father.

32:57.027 --> 32:59.981
And it's not gonna be
your con man brother.

33:00.511 --> 33:02.597
It's gonna be me.

33:02.666 --> 33:06.034
And I'm not gonna be here for you.

33:08.418 --> 33:09.883
Yeah, well...

33:23.628 --> 33:26.224
Ginny Baker, on the mound,

33:26.234 --> 33:28.356
is about to make her final bat
of the baseball season.

33:28.425 --> 33:31.159
This hometown crowd is showing

33:31.228 --> 33:32.494
its full appreciation.

33:34.264 --> 33:36.932
There had to be one voice. My voice.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.600
- I'm out.
- I'm not gonna take it much more.

33:38.669 --> 33:39.868
- Then don't.
- You stand

33:39.937 --> 33:41.837
in the middle of your scariest stage

33:41.905 --> 33:44.536
and you sing your song.

33:56.824 --> 33:59.487
And here's the first pitch.

34:00.794 --> 34:03.625
- Strike!
- Called strike one.

34:07.164 --> 34:10.699
Four strikeouts to go
with a walk and no hits.

34:20.643 --> 34:23.178
We're through five innings,

34:23.246 --> 34:25.380
and Ginny has not allowed a base hit.

34:30.495 --> 34:33.080
Salvamini has it.

34:33.418 --> 34:36.024
- Got him!
- She's through seven.

34:36.092 --> 34:38.693
Oh, my!

34:40.931 --> 34:42.998
Wow.

34:51.641 --> 34:53.675
Really? We're doing this?

34:55.145 --> 34:56.710
Two on, one out.

34:56.780 --> 34:59.792
Salvamini at the plate.
Padres up 1-nothing.

34:59.802 --> 35:03.151
Baker could use
some insurance runs here.

35:03.186 --> 35:05.553
And Salvamini would love
to break out of that

35:05.589 --> 35:07.122
0-for-23 slump.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.124
He's definitely been pressing.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.625
Popped it up.

35:10.694 --> 35:15.330
Infield fly rule is called
and Salvamini is out.

35:19.102 --> 35:20.527
Hey.

35:20.853 --> 35:24.272
- Hey!
- Oh, look at Salvamini. He is hot.

35:24.341 --> 35:26.133
Calm down, calm down.
Just take a breath.

35:26.143 --> 35:28.143
Salvy, what are you doing,
man? Use your head.

35:28.211 --> 35:29.644
- Hey, save it, Mike.
- I got this.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.079
- I got it.
- You can't act like a lunatic

35:31.148 --> 35:32.779
on national TV, especially now.

35:32.789 --> 35:35.083
- Man, I said I got this!
- I'm sorry?

35:35.152 --> 35:37.552
- That'd be a first.
- What the hell's the matter with you?

35:37.587 --> 35:39.587
I'm the captain here,
Blip. I'm doing my job.

35:39.656 --> 35:41.890
You gave that job up
when you gave up on this team.

35:41.959 --> 35:43.725
Or are we just gonna keep pretending
like that didn't happen?!

35:43.794 --> 35:46.423
- Hey, knock it off!
- Just sit down, Captain.

35:46.433 --> 35:47.329
That shouldn't be hard.

35:47.397 --> 35:48.964
Since Livan got here, you're
getting pretty good at it.

35:49.032 --> 35:51.613
- Watch it, Blip.
- I said sit down.

35:52.369 --> 35:54.336
- Hey!
- Settle down!

35:54.404 --> 35:57.906
Mike Lawson and Blip
Sanders had to be separated.

35:57.975 --> 35:59.574
Cool off!

35:59.643 --> 36:01.376
We're good.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.662
You stay in the game.

36:13.731 --> 36:15.776
Two outs here
in the bottom of the seventh.

36:15.786 --> 36:17.040
The stadium buzzing

36:17.050 --> 36:19.989
from that altercation
in the Padres dugout between

36:20.057 --> 36:22.458
two of their hometown heroes.

36:23.045 --> 36:24.836
Meanwhile, history is

36:24.846 --> 36:26.929
in the offing, fans, as Ginny Baker

36:26.964 --> 36:29.965
looks to become not only the first woman

36:30.001 --> 36:33.094
but the first Padre ever
to pitch a no-hitter.

36:33.104 --> 36:35.177
- She's over 100 pitches.
- Aw, it's her last start.

36:35.187 --> 36:37.973
- We had a deal. Limited innings.
- Are you really gonna do this?

36:38.042 --> 36:40.476
- They're gonna crucify you.
- Won't be the first time.

36:43.132 --> 36:44.586
Can't be good.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.275
- Yeah.
- Hey,

36:49.285 --> 36:51.420
- we got to shut her down, Al.
- Always appreciate

36:51.489 --> 36:53.849
a call in the middle of a game, Oscar.

36:53.859 --> 36:55.791
We went over this. You know why.

36:55.860 --> 36:57.726
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

37:00.380 --> 37:03.432
So, what do you think?

37:03.501 --> 37:05.668
You know what I think.

37:05.703 --> 37:07.670
But it's not my ass.

37:07.738 --> 37:10.306
That's why you get the big bucks, Al.

37:14.612 --> 37:17.680
No, Skip, there's no way
I'm not finishing this game.

37:17.748 --> 37:19.148
I'm going back out on that mound.

37:19.217 --> 37:21.967
You'll have to physically
pull me off of it.

37:30.895 --> 37:32.341
Strike three!

37:39.802 --> 37:42.671
Here comes Ginny Baker
to start the eighth inning.

37:42.740 --> 37:44.873
And just listen to this crowd.

37:44.942 --> 37:46.875
Yet another chance to witness

37:46.944 --> 37:48.377
her make history.

37:55.586 --> 37:57.353
Hello?

37:59.976 --> 38:01.811
Baker ready here in the eighth.

38:01.821 --> 38:04.426
And here's the pitch.

38:06.163 --> 38:08.448
Swung on and a miss. Strike three.

38:08.458 --> 38:09.859
Five outs to go.

38:48.805 --> 38:51.073
Way outside. Ball one.

38:53.811 --> 38:57.646
That's four pitches in a row
nowhere near the plate.

38:57.682 --> 39:00.683
You have to wonder
if she's running out of fuel.

39:04.722 --> 39:06.889
Okay, Baker, you want to talk?
Let's talk.

39:06.957 --> 39:08.424
You were right.

39:08.492 --> 39:10.292
It was completely
awkward the other night.

39:10.361 --> 39:12.227
I mean, not in comparison to how
awkward it's been since then.

39:12.296 --> 39:14.096
Now we're bordering on middle
school dance territory.

39:14.165 --> 39:16.627
- It doesn't really matter because...
- Hey. I... Shut up.

39:16.637 --> 39:18.586
Stop trying to distract me from
the fact that I'm throwing a no...

39:18.596 --> 39:20.580
Don't say it. That's not what I'm doing.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.738
Yes, it is. You think I got rattled,
so you're coming out here

39:22.807 --> 39:23.939
on your white horse to give me

39:24.008 --> 39:26.942
one of your great movie speeches.
I don't need a speech from you today.

39:27.011 --> 39:29.745
I don't need a speech from you
or my father

39:29.814 --> 39:31.580
or my brother or my agent.

39:31.649 --> 39:33.682
And I don't need some
billionaire taking me all over

39:33.751 --> 39:35.160
the world, as if I've
got nothing else to do.

39:35.170 --> 39:37.233
He can come watch me train
in Arizona if he wants to.

39:37.243 --> 39:39.121
I don't need a man to rescue me.

39:39.190 --> 39:42.159
I'm the one on the mound right now. Me.

39:42.169 --> 39:44.748
I throw the ball, I give the speeches,

39:44.758 --> 39:46.962
and I decide if you and I
are gonna talk about

39:47.031 --> 39:48.864
what happened the other night, not you.

39:48.933 --> 39:51.800
And I've decided we're not,
by the way, because we're teammates.

39:51.836 --> 39:53.923
And as long as we're teammates,
that's how it's gonna be.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.141
Hey, guys. What's up?

39:55.151 --> 39:57.005
- Get away!
- Get away!

39:57.015 --> 39:59.663
So, go back to home plate,
put down the sign.

39:59.813 --> 40:01.677
And let me finish my no-hitter.

40:01.746 --> 40:05.325
That's right, I said it. I'm throwing
a no-hitter. And if you don't mind,

40:05.335 --> 40:06.815
I'd like to keep doing it.

40:08.152 --> 40:09.141
Fine by me.

40:09.151 --> 40:10.729
- Good.
- Good.

40:12.089 --> 40:13.655
Just... I had a really
great speech, is the...

40:13.724 --> 40:15.244
- Go away.
- Okay.

40:25.851 --> 40:28.570
There we go. That's more like it.

40:33.990 --> 40:35.844
Lawson giving chase.

40:35.913 --> 40:37.212
He...

40:37.281 --> 40:39.081
makes the play.

40:39.150 --> 40:42.699
Oh, my, they're all stepping
up for Ginny today.

40:48.495 --> 40:51.026
Two outs here in the eighth inning.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.177
It's a bunt!

40:54.187 --> 40:55.697
Baker fields.

40:55.733 --> 40:57.032
She got him!

40:57.101 --> 40:58.889
- What a play.
- Yes!

40:58.899 --> 41:00.455
Yeah!

41:02.973 --> 41:04.845
Uh-oh.

41:06.354 --> 41:08.177
In! In!

41:08.245 --> 41:09.781
All right, hang on.

41:09.791 --> 41:11.547
Hang in there.

42:42.250 --> 42:44.340
