WEBVTT

00:13.699 --> 00:15.827
What is she doing?

00:15.900 --> 00:21.019
She said she had to time the calculations
exactly right this time of year.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.234
This time of year?
What difference does it make?

00:24.265 --> 00:26.600
Uh, she said something about solar...

00:27.663 --> 00:31.862
Uh... Well, to be honest with you,
I wasn't really paying attention.

00:31.864 --> 00:32.863
Really?

00:34.386 --> 00:35.762
Carter?

00:37.506 --> 00:41.302
Almost there, sir. This time of year
the direct line between P2X-555...

00:41.307 --> 00:44.728
and the Earth takes us
within 70,000 miles of the sun.

00:44.750 --> 00:49.381
I'm updating the drift calculation to
include gravitational space/time warping.

00:50.271 --> 00:52.274
We know that! Let's go.

00:52.348 --> 00:53.475
Yes, sir.

00:55.191 --> 00:57.277
You can start the dialling procedure.

00:58.033 --> 00:59.951
Sir?

01:00.033 --> 01:03.537
- How's the hand?
- A little sore, but all right. Thank you.

01:03.552 --> 01:05.138
Chevron one encoded.

01:05.233 --> 01:10.634
Take this note with you. Keep it in your
vest pocket till you get on the other side.

01:10.635 --> 01:13.390
It's fairly self-explanatory.

01:13.438 --> 01:15.441
Chevron two encoded.

01:15.516 --> 01:18.269
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

01:18.317 --> 01:22.635
- (technician) Chevron three encoded.
- Time to ship out, Captain.

01:22.638 --> 01:24.640
Yes, sir.

01:26.599 --> 01:28.561
Chevron four encoded.

01:33.884 --> 01:35.887
Chevron five encoded.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.758
Ah! Done already?

01:38.843 --> 01:40.972
Chevron six encoded.

01:46.885 --> 01:48.722
Chevron seven locked.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.554
(rumbling)

02:23.657 --> 02:25.909
(O'Neill) What the...?

02:25.978 --> 02:28.981
- Did you see that?
- Uh, Jack, do you see this?

02:33.057 --> 02:35.061
(O'Neill) Captain Carter...

02:35.139 --> 02:36.724
where are we?

02:36.819 --> 02:40.074
I don't know. For a minute,
we were back in the gate room.

02:44.700 --> 02:50.343
You know, this looks suspiciously
like the butt end of a Titan missile.

02:50.344 --> 02:54.435
(PA) Standing by for test burn
in T minus 20 seconds.

02:55.582 --> 02:58.712
- What is a test burn?
- Just what it sounds like.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.747
Any ideas here?

03:02.706 --> 03:04.292
Abort!

03:04.747 --> 03:05.957
Abort!

03:07.229 --> 03:09.022
Fifteen seconds.

03:10.307 --> 03:11.602
Abort!

03:11.711 --> 03:13.713
Stand by for ignition.

03:15.150 --> 03:16.860
- Abort!
- Ten...

03:16.950 --> 03:19.704
nine, eight, seven...

03:19.751 --> 03:21.086
six...

03:21.189 --> 03:22.859
five...

03:22.951 --> 03:25.163
four, three...

03:25.233 --> 03:27.569
two, one...

03:27.634 --> 03:29.218
ignition.

03:47.278 --> 03:49.281
How'd you know that would work?

03:50.718 --> 03:52.305
- I did not.
- (buzzer)

03:53.561 --> 03:56.105
Hands on your head! Get on your knees!

05:01.019 --> 05:03.689
Who are you?
How did you get into this facility?

05:03.701 --> 05:06.620
- What facility?
- Answer the question!

05:06.661 --> 05:09.456
Sir, don't say anything.
This is the gate room.

05:09.502 --> 05:12.088
- Shut up!
- We're still in Cheyenne Mountain.

05:12.143 --> 05:14.980
Next person who shoots
his mouth off gets this!

05:15.024 --> 05:17.694
- Take them to the holding room.
- Yes, sir.

05:17.745 --> 05:19.747
No, take me to your CO.

05:29.427 --> 05:32.473
The major wants all of this
stowed for transport, sir.

05:33.509 --> 05:35.512
What is it?

05:35.590 --> 05:40.930
My orders are to forget I ever saw it, sir,
so I don't know what you're talking about.

05:41.752 --> 05:43.754
Thank you, Sergeant.

06:00.355 --> 06:03.526
I think we've travelled back in time,
about 30 years.

06:03.557 --> 06:06.687
I think we were in both time frames
simultaneously...

06:06.718 --> 06:10.016
so the Stargate was there
one minute and gone the next.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.418
Little bump in the calculations, Captain?

06:12.478 --> 06:15.358
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what to say.

06:15.399 --> 06:18.653
Get us back home
and we'll say it never happened.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.685
Or get us back before we left
and it won't happen.

06:22.802 --> 06:24.805
Well, think about it.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.923
We're the first humans in history
to go back in time. Well, for all we know.

06:28.925 --> 06:32.639
If we could figure out how to do this
again, think of what we could do.

06:32.644 --> 06:39.326
We could actually visit Babylon. We could
see the Great Wall of China being built!

06:39.326 --> 06:45.286
- Or prevent regrettable historical events.
- No! That's exactly what we can't do.

06:45.288 --> 06:46.288
Why not?

06:46.408 --> 06:49.413
Because of the grandfather paradox.

06:49.449 --> 06:54.528
If you murdered your grandfather, your
own father would never have been born.

06:54.531 --> 06:57.409
So you're saying that
if we change our own past...

06:57.452 --> 07:01.411
We could change our world
in ways that we can't possibly imagine.

07:01.411 --> 07:05.166
We might cease to exist, along with
everything and everyone we know.

07:05.173 --> 07:07.593
I have no part in the history of your world.

07:07.653 --> 07:10.324
But when they find out about
the Goa'uld threat...

07:10.334 --> 07:13.423
they might not open the Stargate
in the first place.

07:13.456 --> 07:18.016
In which case, we never meet and you're
back to being first prime of Apophis.

07:18.019 --> 07:19.687
I see.

07:19.778 --> 07:23.242
So... we don't tell them about the Goa'uld.

07:23.257 --> 07:27.139
How do we explain the larval Goa'uld
that Teal'c is carrying?

07:27.658 --> 07:29.869
Our advanced weapons, our GDOs?

07:29.939 --> 07:31.942
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

07:32.021 --> 07:35.442
haven't we altered history already
just by being here?

07:35.463 --> 07:38.300
We have to concentrate
on damage control.

07:39.182 --> 07:42.062
At the very least, destroy
our weapons and technology.

07:42.105 --> 07:46.305
- That's gonna be a little tough.
- We also cannot tell anyone anything...

07:46.305 --> 07:49.685
about who we are or where we're from.

07:49.706 --> 07:52.418
This is a top-secret facility.

07:52.466 --> 07:54.968
Anonymity does not go over big here.

07:55.026 --> 07:58.365
We cannot tell them
we're from the future, sir.

07:58.387 --> 08:00.266
- Even if...
- (door opens)

08:10.391 --> 08:14.105
- Daniel?
- He asked if we were Soviet spies. I just...

08:17.913 --> 08:19.915
Come with me.

08:21.115 --> 08:22.115
Sure.

08:22.194 --> 08:24.197
You bet.

08:25.194 --> 08:27.197
(O'Neill) Nyet?!

08:42.558 --> 08:44.562
I'm Major Robert Thornbird.

08:47.121 --> 08:49.125
And you are...?

08:50.322 --> 08:52.326
(coughs)

08:52.883 --> 08:55.971
Captain James T Kirk
of the Starship Enterprise.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.168
Your dog tags say otherwise.

09:00.366 --> 09:02.370
They're lying.

09:02.445 --> 09:06.033
Your American accent
is very impressive, Mr Kirk.

09:08.207 --> 09:13.447
Before we ship you out and hand you over
to wherever they take spies like you...

09:13.448 --> 09:15.034
I wanted a word.

09:15.129 --> 09:17.841
Your incursion into our training facility...

09:17.889 --> 09:21.061
is gonna leave
an embarrassing mark on my record.

09:21.091 --> 09:23.428
Training facility?

09:23.493 --> 09:27.613
You don't think we'd test fire a real
missile 28 floors inside a mountain?

09:27.613 --> 09:29.950
Listen, you don't have the exact date...

09:30.013 --> 09:32.475
What was the weapon you used?

09:34.014 --> 09:35.014
Weapon?

09:35.095 --> 09:37.347
Our cameras saw some sort of weapon.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.081
Well, it's hard to say.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.349
Some sort of state secret?

09:43.418 --> 09:45.879
No, just difficult to pronounce.

09:49.580 --> 09:55.340
My government doesn't take kindly
to spies in its highest security facilities.

09:55.340 --> 09:57.217
Neither do I.

09:57.302 --> 09:58.302
Oh...

09:58.381 --> 10:00.176
Bob... Can I call you Bob?

10:00.261 --> 10:02.347
Even though you achieved nothing.

10:02.422 --> 10:05.552
Unless that's exactly
what we were trying to achieve.

10:05.583 --> 10:09.840
Kirk, you can talk to me,
or you can talk to the CIA.

10:12.947 --> 10:13.947
Ooh...

10:15.346 --> 10:16.346
All right.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.428
I'll be honest with you, Bob.

10:22.067 --> 10:24.070
My name's not Kirk.

10:25.469 --> 10:29.390
It's Skywalker. Luke Skywalker.

10:49.275 --> 10:52.822
Still no sign of SG-1, sir.
They never made it to P2X-555.

10:52.836 --> 10:54.212
Very well.

10:54.317 --> 10:56.863
SG-5 will have to complete their mission.

10:56.918 --> 10:59.797
If I may ask, sir,
what are we going to do about SG-1?

10:59.840 --> 11:04.159
They're out there somewhere.
Hopefully, they'll find their way back.

11:04.159 --> 11:06.163
Shouldn't we start a search?

11:07.639 --> 11:10.894
I'm afraid this is one mission
they're on their own.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.465
Yes, sir.

11:20.524 --> 11:26.326
I don't know where we're headed. They'll
split us up. We won't have much time to...

11:26.327 --> 11:29.749
Escape and live out our lives
without affecting history.

11:29.765 --> 11:30.765
Or...

11:30.846 --> 11:33.932
I can't think of an "or" at the moment, sir.

11:33.966 --> 11:35.760
- No "or"?
- There's an "or".

11:35.849 --> 11:39.270
You can't will something to happen
because you want it that way.

11:39.289 --> 11:42.126
Captain, where there's a will,
there's an "or".

11:43.211 --> 11:44.754
Way.

11:44.850 --> 11:49.899
If I remain on this planet, I will eventually
be taken over by my mature symbiote.

12:11.620 --> 12:13.873
I'll keep an eye. You help the driver.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.587
- Flat tyre?
- I'm the one who arranged it.

12:25.623 --> 12:28.878
Before I even think of doing
what's asked of me in the note...

12:28.903 --> 12:32.741
I need to know who you are
and who gave it to you.

12:34.024 --> 12:35.443
Oh, my God!

12:39.748 --> 12:43.629
My name is Samantha Carter
and you gave me the note, sir.

12:45.586 --> 12:47.673
General Hammond gave me a note...

12:47.746 --> 12:51.543
and told me to keep it in my pocket
until I got to the other side.

12:51.549 --> 12:54.804
It's addressed to me. In my handwriting.

12:55.831 --> 12:58.167
What's it say?

12:58.790 --> 13:00.168
"Help them."

13:02.313 --> 13:07.153
Helping you will lead to court martial,
so I'd like to know why I would do that.

13:07.153 --> 13:11.592
- Because it's your idea.
- Albeit one you won't have for 30 years.

13:11.594 --> 13:12.886
What?

13:12.995 --> 13:18.253
I know this is hard to understand, but that
is how far back in time we've travelled.

13:20.798 --> 13:24.136
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.
- (Daniel) Wait!

13:24.158 --> 13:26.161
We can... we can prove it.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.926
- (O'Neill) What's the date?
- August 4th.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.034
1969.

13:34.120 --> 13:38.168
- '69. What happened in '69?
- The moon landing.

13:39.283 --> 13:44.082
- That was a couple of weeks ago, right?
- The entire world knows that.

13:44.084 --> 13:48.125
But you watched it from your father's
bedside in his hospital room...

13:48.125 --> 13:50.587
just two days after his first heart attack.

13:52.927 --> 13:55.472
- How did you know?
- Because we know you.

13:57.807 --> 13:59.808
We will know you.

13:59.886 --> 14:03.100
For some reason, 30 years ago
you decided we would need help.

14:03.129 --> 14:05.884
Otherwise you wouldn't be
standing there with a note.

14:07.370 --> 14:10.793
Now, are you gonna
listen to yourself... or not?

14:27.015 --> 14:30.562
- There are two men, including the driver.
- Thank you.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.043
Ow!

14:36.379 --> 14:38.381
I'm sorry, miss. Did I hurt you?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.462
It's "Captain".

14:40.540 --> 14:42.710
And it's all right, Lieutenant.

14:43.701 --> 14:45.705
Uh... May I see the note?

14:48.500 --> 14:52.130
We don't want to hurt anybody,
but we do have to knock those guys out.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.628
Will this do?

15:02.426 --> 15:03.802
Call for help.

15:03.907 --> 15:09.456
The dangerous foreign agents you now
guard have inexplicably freed themselves.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.325
Help!

15:23.832 --> 15:28.672
- Where's the rest of our gear?
- In a separate truck for security reasons.

15:28.673 --> 15:33.221
- They should be right behind.
- OK, good. Get down on the ground. Go!

16:22.048 --> 16:25.638
Everything you confiscated from us
is in these two boxes?

16:25.648 --> 16:29.653
- Except for your ray gun, yes.
- Right.

16:37.292 --> 16:38.292
Watch yourself.

16:46.375 --> 16:50.004
Your Major Whatshisname
had video tape of this thing in action.

16:50.014 --> 16:53.437
Uh, yes. It was in those boxes
along with everything else.

16:53.456 --> 16:55.207
Good.

16:56.697 --> 16:59.826
- Got any cash?
- Uh, yeah.

16:59.859 --> 17:02.361
- I might have some.
- That's good.

17:02.418 --> 17:05.798
I'll pay you back. With interest.

17:08.343 --> 17:12.622
You must keep everything you've seen
and everything we've told you a secret.

17:12.622 --> 17:15.500
- For the rest of your life.
- General Hammond.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.711
I like the sound of that.

17:17.781 --> 17:20.076
What are you gonna do now?

17:20.144 --> 17:22.480
Well, you're better off not knowing.

17:22.544 --> 17:27.468
But I do want you to know that I'm about
to keep you from getting court-martialled.

17:31.548 --> 17:34.635
We should get off this road.
Find the interstate.

17:42.388 --> 17:46.185
- (Daniel) So what's the plan?
- (O'Neill) Find the Stargate.

17:46.192 --> 17:50.871
- (Daniel) That's the plan?
- (O'Neill) Elegant in its simplicity, isn't it?

17:50.872 --> 17:53.125
And if we don't find the Stargate?

17:53.193 --> 17:57.673
- There's one in Antarctica.
- Antarctica! That's a fabulous plan.

17:57.674 --> 18:01.137
(Teal'c) Assuming we find the Stargate,
how do we get back to the future?

18:01.154 --> 18:03.157
Well, now, that's all in the note.

18:04.194 --> 18:05.698
Right?

18:05.795 --> 18:07.381
Uh, no, sir.

18:08.198 --> 18:09.198
No, sir?

18:09.278 --> 18:13.409
Well, it doesn't explain how to get back.
At least, not explicitly.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.746
"Help them."

18:17.840 --> 18:22.388
"August 10th, 9.15am.
August 11th, 6.03pm."

18:24.482 --> 18:26.486
That's helpful.

18:26.563 --> 18:31.241
He had to be intentionally cryptic, so as
not to risk changing his own history.

18:31.242 --> 18:33.829
August 10th. That's cryptic.

18:33.884 --> 18:37.265
It just means that at 9.15am
something is going to happen.

18:37.285 --> 18:39.955
And happen again the next day at 6.03.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.375
We just have to figure out
what that something is.

18:48.409 --> 18:49.409
Right.

18:54.489 --> 18:56.491
(car approaches)

19:00.092 --> 19:05.093
The 'Vette blew it when they went with
that body style. They used to be so cool.

19:05.094 --> 19:08.682
Actually, I was about
four-and-a-half years old in '69.

19:10.855 --> 19:12.858
Carter, stick your thumb out.

19:18.655 --> 19:20.741
(Daniel) We should go to New York.

19:20.817 --> 19:22.402
Why?

19:22.498 --> 19:28.018
That's where Catherine lived, or lives.
She's the only person outside of military...

19:28.019 --> 19:31.857
who might know about the Stargate.
She won't tell us over the phone.

19:31.859 --> 19:33.112
Daniel, you can't.

19:34.222 --> 19:39.502
In order to preserve our past, Catherine
has to first meet you years from now.

19:39.502 --> 19:41.798
So we go in disguise.

19:41.862 --> 19:44.740
Pretend to be... foreigners.

19:44.781 --> 19:49.538
- How are you gonna do that?
- I speak 23 different languages. Pick one.

19:52.705 --> 19:55.167
She began her research in the late '60s.

19:55.266 --> 19:58.354
Maybe we gave her the idea
in the first place.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.792
This method appears to be ineffective.

20:07.349 --> 20:08.727
Teal'c. Teal'c!

20:15.991 --> 20:18.663
What are you thinking?

20:18.673 --> 20:20.676
That is effective, O'Neill.

20:22.674 --> 20:24.678
Hey! We would've stopped, man.

20:24.756 --> 20:29.195
Hi. Listen, we've got gas money.
Where are you headed?

20:29.195 --> 20:32.491
Upstate New York. Some big concert.
Where you headed?

20:32.516 --> 20:34.559
New York. Back East.

20:34.636 --> 20:36.222
Hop in.

20:46.601 --> 20:49.188
Ride up front with me, brother. It's cool.

20:56.123 --> 20:58.125
I'm Michael.

20:58.203 --> 21:00.749
I am not at liberty to reveal my identity.

21:01.365 --> 21:03.368
Far out!

21:16.930 --> 21:18.932
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:22.650 --> 21:24.653
So what'd you do?

21:28.012 --> 21:30.224
We didn't, uh...

21:30.294 --> 21:32.296
We didn't do anything.

21:33.654 --> 21:35.824
We've got a little problem with...

21:36.454 --> 21:38.458
the Establishment.

21:38.536 --> 21:40.538
I so relate to that.

21:40.617 --> 21:43.038
So if you could take us
as far as New York...

21:43.096 --> 21:44.515
I really love your hair.

21:46.337 --> 21:47.337
Thanks.

21:50.699 --> 21:54.287
Listen, we could really use
some cheap clothes.

21:54.298 --> 21:58.380
If you see a cheap clothes place around,
we'd appreciate it.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.384
No sweat!

22:03.943 --> 22:05.528
So, uh...

22:05.624 --> 22:07.626
Your thing... That thing...

22:08.383 --> 22:10.385
What's it symbolise? Peace?

22:10.462 --> 22:12.465
Slavery to false gods.

22:13.546 --> 22:15.131
Right on!

22:15.787 --> 22:17.788
So, um, it's made out of...

22:18.626 --> 22:20.712
- Do not discuss it further.
- I dig!

22:20.787 --> 22:22.623
It's cool.

22:23.748 --> 22:25.750
So you just go AWOL?

22:27.028 --> 22:29.156
Hey, we're cool.

22:29.230 --> 22:34.589
After the concert, me and Jenny, we're
thinking of crossing the border to Canada.

22:34.589 --> 22:36.174
For what reason?

22:36.270 --> 22:39.608
You know, man. The war.

22:39.633 --> 22:41.760
The war with Canada?

22:44.073 --> 22:45.659
No.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.673
Flare.

24:24.741 --> 24:26.744
- What?
- It's the only explanation.

24:26.862 --> 24:31.142
- We're here because of a solar flare.
- Not an error in your calculations?

24:31.144 --> 24:36.585
I don't think so. After the Abydos mission,
when we couldn't make the gate work...

24:36.585 --> 24:40.339
I researched alternative applications,
including time travel.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.682
- What'd you come up with?
- Just this.

24:43.787 --> 24:47.500
What if... a massive solar flare
just happened to occur...

24:47.508 --> 24:51.667
exactly when we were travelling
between Earth and another Stargate?

24:51.669 --> 24:56.587
If the wormhole moved closer to the sun
because of the flare's magnetic field...

24:56.589 --> 24:59.802
the increased gravity
could slingshot us back to Earth.

24:59.832 --> 25:04.191
- Why haven't we tried this before?
- Because flares are impossible to predict.

25:04.192 --> 25:08.711
Light takes several minutes to travel, so
by the time a flare has been confirmed...

25:08.712 --> 25:10.715
it's already too late.

25:10.794 --> 25:14.633
If they're impossible to predict,
how do we get ourselves home?

25:14.635 --> 25:17.556
August 10th, 9.15am. It's in the note.

25:17.596 --> 25:20.017
- That's the time of the next flare?
- Yeah.

25:20.076 --> 25:23.039
General Hammond must've
used my research to work it out.

25:23.077 --> 25:25.832
Maybe that's why he asked you
to do the research.

25:25.877 --> 25:29.968
And then he looked up two flares in
August of 1969 that could send us home.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.493
General Hammond, you old son of a...

25:34.560 --> 25:36.271
(twigs crack)

25:42.003 --> 25:43.588
Hello.

25:44.164 --> 25:45.666
Soup?

25:45.763 --> 25:47.307
Who are you guys?

25:48.566 --> 25:50.693
Come on, have something to eat.

25:50.765 --> 25:53.935
Travelling between Earth and where?
What's that about?

25:53.965 --> 25:57.554
- When I said that, I was just imagining...
- I don't think so, man.

25:57.567 --> 26:01.239
You said that you were in trouble
with the Establishment.

26:01.248 --> 26:02.708
(O'Neill) And...

26:02.807 --> 26:04.644
we are.

26:06.211 --> 26:08.381
- We are.
- Just not the Establishment...

26:08.451 --> 26:11.330
of this planet.

26:13.612 --> 26:15.615
No, it's true, Michael.

26:16.731 --> 26:20.852
We came to Earth to hide among
your people a long, long time ago.

26:20.854 --> 26:24.442
From a galaxy far, far away.

26:28.696 --> 26:31.784
But now it's time to go home.
And we need your help.

26:31.817 --> 26:33.862
How?

26:33.938 --> 26:37.567
We need to be in a place
called New York by tomorrow.

26:37.578 --> 26:39.707
I don't know, man.

26:51.422 --> 26:53.423
It's all right.

27:02.346 --> 27:03.890
Whoa!

27:03.984 --> 27:05.988
That was unreal!

27:06.065 --> 27:10.113
It is, in fact, extremely real.
As is our need for assistance.

27:14.588 --> 27:17.009
We have to help them get home, Michael.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.965
OK. We'll do it.

28:06.364 --> 28:10.363
Sir, remember to use
the hydrogen-alpha solar filter.

28:10.365 --> 28:14.287
- Or I'll burn my eyes out. I know.
- Good luck.

28:21.928 --> 28:23.512
(O'Neill) Yes!

28:27.848 --> 28:32.969
All right. We've got one shot to prove
Carter's theory. Don't screw it up, Jack.

28:32.971 --> 28:35.974
Is not astronomy
one of your hobbies, O'Neill?

28:36.012 --> 28:38.016
Not quite on this scale.

28:38.452 --> 28:40.455
Let's get that dome open.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.423
Father never told me
Heinrich Gruber had a son.

29:17.261 --> 29:22.503
(German accent) I was a small boy when
they were still working together, but...

29:22.506 --> 29:25.176
mein Vater often spoke of dein Vater...

29:25.185 --> 29:28.440
as one of the few people
in this world he could trust.

29:28.464 --> 29:30.551
Before we continue I must ask...

29:30.625 --> 29:34.756
what was so important it couldn't be
discussed over the telephone?

29:39.229 --> 29:44.189
Mein father believed
there must have been a second artefact...

29:44.190 --> 29:50.074
near that which
dein Vater discovered in 1928.

29:54.953 --> 29:58.875
He referred to it in his notes
as a "doorway to heaven".

30:13.198 --> 30:17.037
You found only a fragment?
Nothing beneath?

30:17.039 --> 30:19.501
The artefact had already been removed.

30:21.079 --> 30:26.171
We always knew there had to be a second
device with which to control the ring.

30:31.323 --> 30:35.644
I realise these matters require
the utmost propriety, but...

30:35.644 --> 30:41.565
Did your father ever explain to you the
nature of the work he was doing in 1945?

30:41.567 --> 30:43.778
Only that the American military...

30:43.846 --> 30:49.445
was under the mistaken impression
that the device dein father discovered...

30:49.448 --> 30:51.451
might hold some...

30:51.528 --> 30:53.530
dark military purpose.

30:54.929 --> 30:58.930
Even that much, I was sworn to secrecy.

30:58.931 --> 31:02.310
- There was an accident.
- Ernest Littlefield.

31:02.333 --> 31:06.756
When the war ended, my father and I
were told never to speak of it again.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.746
It is simply locked away.

31:10.813 --> 31:14.402
And... you cannot tell me where?

31:14.415 --> 31:18.086
Some old armoury in Washington, DC,
gathering dust.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.237
But it's pointless.

31:21.698 --> 31:24.701
The military won't even
acknowledge its existence.

31:28.819 --> 31:32.909
Would you know which armoury?

31:37.142 --> 31:41.439
All right. In a few seconds, we'll know
whether or not we can go back.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.675
And if we cannot, O'Neill?

31:44.742 --> 31:47.247
I guess we stay.

31:51.586 --> 31:53.588
All right. It's showtime.

32:03.107 --> 32:05.109
Brother Teal'c...

32:05.950 --> 32:08.287
at precisely 6.03pm tomorrow...

32:09.390 --> 32:11.393
we're going home.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.069
- (Carter) Well?
- Your theory is confirmed.

32:24.113 --> 32:26.826
Where do we have to be
for tomorrow's flare?

32:26.874 --> 32:29.001
Washington, DC.

32:46.401 --> 32:50.490
We're almost there, sir.
We must find a power source right away.

32:51.481 --> 32:53.483
We will.

32:56.443 --> 32:59.323
Listen, I really have to say this.

33:00.244 --> 33:03.540
The two of you have been unbelievably...

33:03.567 --> 33:04.567
Groovy.

33:06.646 --> 33:09.567
Groovy, I think, is the word.

33:09.606 --> 33:12.862
The people of our world
will be extremely grateful.

33:12.887 --> 33:15.976
- Not the Establishment, mind you.
- No, not them.

33:17.769 --> 33:21.692
What we're trying to say is that
we have to go the rest of the way alone.

33:22.971 --> 33:24.221
Why?

33:25.652 --> 33:29.811
- Because it's dangerous.
- We want you to take us with you.

33:29.814 --> 33:33.192
- We can't do that.
- But you owe us.

33:33.214 --> 33:35.259
Yes, we do. We owe you a lot.

33:36.453 --> 33:38.457
But you belong here.

33:39.374 --> 33:44.095
You have to trust me on this -
this is a great time.

33:44.096 --> 33:46.474
Michael got drafted.

33:49.258 --> 33:53.388
We were just going to the concert first.
You know, one last blast.

33:53.819 --> 33:55.823
But if we went with you...

33:57.540 --> 33:59.501
I don't wanna kill anybody.

33:59.582 --> 34:01.835
- Michael...
- Sir, you can't say anything!

34:05.103 --> 34:07.522
He has to make up his own mind.

34:14.425 --> 34:16.844
We can walk
the rest of the way from here.

34:17.507 --> 34:19.509
We gotta go.

34:19.585 --> 34:21.172
I'm sorry.

34:31.190 --> 34:33.192
Your secret's safe with us.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.992
I know that. Thank you.

34:37.112 --> 34:39.114
Take care.

35:48.650 --> 35:49.735
Where to?

35:49.851 --> 35:54.652
- Back the way we came, via P2X-555.
- How do you know we'll travel forward?

35:54.653 --> 35:58.409
General Hammond must've chosen flares
on the opposite side of the sun...

35:58.414 --> 36:03.295
so the sun's rotational differential
will send us forward instead of back.

36:03.295 --> 36:07.612
We just have to trust him. We are
15 minutes away from our only chance!

36:07.614 --> 36:11.746
- And we haven't found a power source...
- How much power?

36:18.298 --> 36:20.719
(engine revs)

36:26.461 --> 36:28.465
Keep it going!

36:57.630 --> 36:59.632
You, stop!

37:02.391 --> 37:04.518
We have got to go.

37:15.074 --> 37:18.204
The timing has to be exact.
Just a few more seconds.

37:18.237 --> 37:19.864
It's close enough. Go!

37:22.438 --> 37:24.648
(gunshots)

37:36.601 --> 37:38.646
Get down!

37:47.682 --> 37:49.226
Auntie Em?

37:49.324 --> 37:51.994
- Auntie Em?
- (Carter) Where is everyone?

37:59.568 --> 38:00.945
Hello, Jack.

38:03.606 --> 38:04.983
Teal'c.

38:07.050 --> 38:08.427
Daniel?

38:10.570 --> 38:12.739
I hardly recognised you with hair.

38:17.931 --> 38:19.266
(clears throat)

38:19.371 --> 38:20.748
Do...

38:21.413 --> 38:22.748
Do we know you?

38:22.855 --> 38:26.777
Sam will recognise me. Come closer.

38:31.856 --> 38:34.693
Oh, my God! Cassandra!

38:34.737 --> 38:36.447
Dear Sam!

38:36.536 --> 38:37.788
Excuse me.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.900
- Who is this?
- Cassandra.

38:41.378 --> 38:44.050
- Cassie's 13 years old.
- Not any more, Jack.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.217
I've been expecting you -
my whole life, in fact.

38:48.260 --> 38:51.516
You entered the Stargate
a few seconds too soon...

38:51.943 --> 38:54.739
so the flare threw you far into the future.

38:55.822 --> 38:58.534
I've come to send you back
where you belong.

38:58.583 --> 39:02.543
- How did you know we'd come here?
- When I was old enough to understand...

39:02.545 --> 39:07.505
Sam explained what happened,
and that I'd be the one to send you home.

39:07.505 --> 39:10.469
- Like a self-fulfilling prophecy?
- Mm-hm.

39:10.507 --> 39:15.467
As much as I'd love to spend more time
with you, the timing must be precise.

39:15.469 --> 39:18.514
- You have to go.
- Already? But there's so much that you...

39:18.547 --> 39:20.425
You know I can't.

39:30.351 --> 39:32.355
I will tell you this.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.893
Your journey's just beginning.

39:46.675 --> 39:49.346
Incoming traveller, sir.

39:49.398 --> 39:51.400
(Stargate alarm)

39:52.077 --> 39:54.498
- It's SG-1!
- Open the iris.

40:06.641 --> 40:07.978
Yes!

40:16.766 --> 40:18.768
We're home.

40:20.606 --> 40:24.527
Thanks to one sparky,
young Lieutenant Hammond.

40:25.809 --> 40:27.186
How did you know, sir?

40:27.289 --> 40:31.648
As a Lieutenant, I was asked to escort
four people out of Cheyenne Mountain.

40:31.648 --> 40:34.862
In the vest pocket of one,
I found a note with my name on it.

40:34.891 --> 40:37.353
Needless to say,
I followed its instructions.

40:38.650 --> 40:43.411
- And you knew when to give it to me?
- Not until I saw the cut on your hand.

40:43.411 --> 40:45.539
Remember when I took your cuffs off?

40:45.612 --> 40:47.907
Then you've been waiting
for this to happen.

40:48.375 --> 40:52.088
Ever since we met.
I almost didn't let you go.

40:52.096 --> 40:55.851
But if you didn't,
you would've changed your own history.

40:55.856 --> 40:59.695
It's going to be a long debriefing, people.
We'll start in one hour.

40:59.697 --> 41:00.739
Yes, sir.

41:00.856 --> 41:03.067
Oh, by the way, Colonel...

41:03.137 --> 41:07.498
with interest,
you owe me 539 dollars and 50 cents.

41:07.500 --> 41:08.960
Yes, sir.
