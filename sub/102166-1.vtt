WEBVTT

02:28.232 --> 02:29.650
What is this place?

02:30.943 --> 02:32.361
Our new home.

02:32.635 --> 02:34.188
David, look!

02:35.614 --> 02:37.032
David, don't run.

02:37.295 --> 02:39.711
Look at that! Look!

02:40.298 --> 02:42.610
- Wheels!
- Wheels?

02:42.645 --> 02:44.819
There are wheels.
It's like a big car.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.208
-Hey, kids.
-Yes?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.788
Okay.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.293
Let's go in.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.210
Whoa!

02:56.218 --> 02:58.220
Don't be like that. Come inside.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.663
Come on.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.808
This isn't what you promised.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.728
Grab onto this and step here.

03:10.742 --> 03:12.640
Okay. Whoa.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.850
Okay.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.993
Is that a house?
I don't see any houses.

03:21.028 --> 03:22.063
Over there.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.418
It just gets worse and worse.

03:30.461 --> 03:31.629
-Kids.
-Yes?

03:32.338 --> 03:33.672
Want to see something even better?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.698
Stop it!

04:01.367 --> 04:02.993
How far is the hatchery from here?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.745
Come here.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.914
Look.

04:07.957 --> 04:08.958
Take a look at this.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.211
Look at the dirt.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.422
Look at the color.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.883
This is why I picked this place.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.427
Because of the dirt color?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.430
This is the best dirt in America.

04:32.237 --> 04:33.445
David!

04:34.984 --> 04:37.152
Daddy's going to make a big garden!

04:40.003 --> 04:41.384
Garden is small.

04:41.971 --> 04:43.317
No!

04:44.387 --> 04:47.873
Garden of Eden is big!
Like this!

04:51.333 --> 04:52.334
David, don't run!

04:54.915 --> 04:56.019
You okay?

05:07.349 --> 05:09.059
Where should Grandma's picture go?

05:11.895 --> 05:13.856
We're not staying long.
Leave it in the box.

05:15.556 --> 05:18.318
Is the heart murmur getting louder?

05:19.028 --> 05:20.029
Yeah.

05:21.030 --> 05:23.032
One or two reading are okay.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.534
But we'll keep checking.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.954
We'll move closer to a hospital.

05:29.621 --> 05:33.584
Let's sleep together on the floor
for our first night.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.712
No, Dad! You snore!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.800
I want to listen too.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.844
You do?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.141
Put these in your ears.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.943
Don't forget to keep praying.

06:07.539 --> 06:09.299
Back her up.
Nice and slow.

06:09.334 --> 06:11.336
There you go now, nice and slow.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.613
And...

06:29.561 --> 06:31.667
All right, listen up, everyone!

06:31.701 --> 06:35.187
Now this here is Mr. Jacob,
and this is Monica Yi.

06:36.465 --> 06:38.674
Mr. Yi is an expert
chicken sexer.

06:38.708 --> 06:42.505
He's worked in California
and Seattle, so, uh,

06:42.540 --> 06:45.094
let's give him a big Arkansas welcome!

06:48.373 --> 06:49.754
This way.

06:49.788 --> 06:52.722
Okay, here we put
the males in the blue bin

06:52.757 --> 06:54.828
and the females in the white bin.

06:54.862 --> 06:56.726
Okay, go to work.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.466
Hello.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.802
Hello!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.138
There are Koreans here!

07:09.471 --> 07:10.639
A few of us.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.777
David.

07:15.504 --> 07:18.472
Okay.
You read the E volume

07:18.507 --> 07:20.647
and I'll read the C volume.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.789
I've never seen anyone as fast as Mr. Yi.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.251
Must've made good money in California.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.044
He did.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.423
But I wasn't fast enough to work there.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.342
How long have you been working?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.636
About six months.

07:49.745 --> 07:50.780
Oh.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.224
In any case, you're fast enough for here.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.018
You came to the right place.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.585
Mom, what can I do?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.401
Go to your sister.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.363
Let's go.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.574
Daddy can take a break.

08:12.784 --> 08:13.952
David, don't run.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.339
What's that?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.507
That?

08:29.593 --> 08:33.138
Male chicks are discarded there.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.015
What is "discarded"?

08:36.516 --> 08:37.976
That's a difficult word, huh?

08:39.208 --> 08:40.554
Hmm...

08:41.271 --> 08:44.358
Male chicks don't taste good.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.569
They can't lay eggs and have no use.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.115
So, you and I should try to be useful.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.450
Okay?

08:55.911 --> 08:56.912
Come here.

08:57.996 --> 08:58.997
Sit down.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.587
Son.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.756
How do you like our farm?

09:07.857 --> 09:09.341
It's good.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.514
How was our land in California?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.476
-We had nothing.
-That's right.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.062
We had nothing.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.407
But now...

09:35.117 --> 09:39.121
We have this big piece of land.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.748
Isn't that good?

09:43.750 --> 09:47.546
Then tell Mommy you really like it.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.631
Okay?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.427
Let's go inside.

09:57.556 --> 10:01.727
The Koreans live in Rogers
near three other big towns.

10:02.102 --> 10:06.315
If we move there we could find
a Korean grandma to babysit.

10:07.733 --> 10:11.903
There's a big mall, a good school,
and people actually live there.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.572
But what about the deal we made?

10:14.698 --> 10:18.285
You can work here
and I can build a garden.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.163
You can get five acres in Rogers.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.541
Five acres is a hobby.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
But my dream is fifty acres.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.671
That land is your dream?

10:31.214 --> 10:34.134
Anyway, we don't need a babysitter.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.055
There's no one around. What could happen?

10:42.100 --> 10:44.311
But what if something happens to him?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.232
The hospital is an hour away.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.947
That's strange. The sky is green.

11:15.813 --> 11:17.642
Let's give them Mountain Dew.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.851
No! Only water. Okay?

11:22.233 --> 11:23.372
Okay...

11:23.517 --> 11:24.935
The car is ready.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.771
We'll assess the situation
before we escape.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.649
Escape? Why?

11:32.109 --> 11:35.529
If the tornado hits,
this house will fly away.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.327
Stop staring. Go to the car.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.288
We need to wait here and watch.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.581
Watch what?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.042
The news is tracking the tornado.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.460
Look.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.759
Mom!

12:05.016 --> 12:06.560
See?

12:07.102 --> 12:09.688
It's a "tornado watch," not a "warning."

12:16.278 --> 12:17.904
We worried for no reason.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.328
Are you crazy?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.205
Who's calling who crazy?

12:39.655 --> 12:41.243
Write it big.

12:41.277 --> 12:42.382
Okay.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.020
For you, for our kids!

12:50.103 --> 12:53.023
For our kids? Come on!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.649
I worked for ten years.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.026
Ten years!

12:56.234 --> 12:58.111
Staring at chicken butts all day.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.488
Working myself to the bone!

13:00.030 --> 13:02.616
Living in a tiny home with no money!

13:02.866 --> 13:05.118
And where did that money go?

13:05.327 --> 13:08.371
-Don't start again.
-Start what?

13:08.580 --> 13:10.874
How much money went to the kids?

13:10.999 --> 13:14.211
I'm the eldest son.
I had to take care of my family.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.379
I'm done now. They're all doing well!

13:16.463 --> 13:19.049
Who's doing well? My mother? Us?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.634
Which family are you even talking about?

13:20.717 --> 13:21.843
Enough!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.988
We said we wanted a new start.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.784
This is it.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.126
If this is the "start" you wanted...

13:58.296 --> 13:59.923
Maybe there's no chance for us.

14:29.730 --> 14:31.594
Oh, no.

14:48.266 --> 14:49.923
<i>Well, the mobile home was set up</i>

14:49.958 --> 14:51.166
<i>approximately three weeks ago,</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:53.099
<i>and the owner had yet to tie it down.</i>

14:53.133 --> 14:56.999
<i>When the wind came,
it just started rolling.</i>

15:01.038 --> 15:04.179
My favorite. My favorite.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.869
You're up already?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.152
Mmm.

15:22.964 --> 15:27.844
Mom, Anne said we have to move.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.012
Is that true?

15:29.095 --> 15:33.391
Would you live in a house like this
when you're married?

15:34.184 --> 15:37.687
I'm going to live here till the day I die.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.530
But are we really moving?

15:49.396 --> 15:50.535
Hmm...

15:50.700 --> 15:54.579
Dad and I talked last night.
We're not moving.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.248
Grandma will come to live with us instead.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.541
Mommy's mom?

15:59.084 --> 16:00.085
Yeah.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.672
She'll finally meet David.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.715
Isn't that nice?

16:06.716 --> 16:07.717
Yes.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.262
I'll be outside.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.056
Okay.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.813
We should get this place ready.
David, eat up.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.731
I'll help you.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.329
Just set it down anywhere.

16:30.092 --> 16:32.370
-Is it down?
Yes.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.657
I'm... I'm thinkin'
about water.

16:43.692 --> 16:47.523
I think about water,
let the stick do the rest.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.671
I find it every time.

16:58.914 --> 17:02.055
So that's $250

17:02.090 --> 17:05.024
for one good, clean water well

17:05.058 --> 17:07.336
and, uh, $300 for two.

17:11.754 --> 17:13.722
$300?

17:13.756 --> 17:15.068
I tell you what then.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.519
Fella before you thought
he could save money, too.

17:17.553 --> 17:19.555
You know what happened to him, huh?

17:23.835 --> 17:25.354
No, we don't need.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.080
Let's go back.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.841
Americans...

17:29.924 --> 17:32.260
Believing that nonsense!

17:33.017 --> 17:33.914
David

17:33.845 --> 17:36.181
Korean people use their heads.

17:36.572 --> 17:37.573
Okay?

17:38.126 --> 17:40.197
We use our minds.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.522
Hey, come here.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.858
Come.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.235
Look.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
When it rains...

17:50.276 --> 17:51.656
Where will the water go?

17:53.279 --> 17:55.177
High place or low place?

17:55.557 --> 17:56.627
Low place.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.119
That's right.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.788
Where is the low place?

18:02.874 --> 18:03.875
That's right.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.251
Where else?

18:05.256 --> 18:06.533
There?

18:07.672 --> 18:08.708
Okay.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.381
Then which place has lots of water?

18:10.261 --> 18:12.263
There.

18:12.298 --> 18:15.197
Why?'Cause trees like water.

18:16.387 --> 18:17.680
My clever, little boy!

18:51.820 --> 18:53.166
David?

18:54.342 --> 18:58.179
Never pay for anything
you can find for free.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.521
For the house,
we have to pay for water.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.661
Huh?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.897
But for our farm,

19:07.981 --> 19:11.401
we can get free water from the land.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.737
That's how we use our minds.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.197
Got it?

19:18.783 --> 19:20.326
Anne, stay here.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.791
Mom.

19:27.208 --> 19:31.713
Do we have to burn
all our trash from now on?

19:32.463 --> 19:34.299
Yes. Isn't the city better?

19:41.663 --> 19:42.733
David.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.645
Did we use that stupid stick?
How did we find this?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.564
We used our minds!

19:49.898 --> 19:51.232
We used our minds!

19:58.531 --> 19:59.824
More! More!

20:04.579 --> 20:05.580
So scary!

20:10.168 --> 20:11.794
-You like them?
-Yes.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.254
Not too big?

20:13.379 --> 20:14.505
They're good.

20:15.662 --> 20:18.631
<i>Now you're
a common sense man, Mr. Yi,</i>

20:18.665 --> 20:21.289
taking land
folks are too scared to buy.

20:21.323 --> 20:24.292
-I admire a thinking man.
Thank you.

20:24.326 --> 20:25.948
Now, let me tell you,
with farming these days,

20:25.983 --> 20:28.399
you gotta go big or go home,
that's just how it is.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.781
It's a good time for it.

20:30.815 --> 20:34.163
Reagan's out to make sure
that the farmers are happy.

20:34.198 --> 20:36.787
And I'll be right here to help you.

20:36.821 --> 20:38.823
- Thank you very much.
- You brought your helper.

20:38.858 --> 20:42.310
Would you like a sucker?

20:42.344 --> 20:46.245
I bet you would like the blue one.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.869
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.422
You're welcome.

21:04.573 --> 21:07.024
If there's something
wrong, you can call the owner.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.750
I'm just the one hauling it.

21:10.545 --> 21:13.099
Hey, there.
My name's Paul.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.691
David, introduce yourself.

21:15.826 --> 21:16.896
Say hello.

21:22.177 --> 21:25.042
Okay. Two thousand.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.632
Thank you.
You know, Mr. Yi,

21:29.322 --> 21:30.703
if you want,

21:32.014 --> 21:33.361
I drive these things all day.

21:33.395 --> 21:35.294
I drive them in my sleep.

21:36.812 --> 21:38.297
I'm a good worker.

21:38.780 --> 21:39.988
Thank you,

21:40.022 --> 21:43.578
but these are Korean
vegetables, Korean fruits.

21:43.612 --> 21:44.682
Korean?

21:46.995 --> 21:48.686
I wanna show you something.

21:51.379 --> 21:52.932
You better take a look at this.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.624
Look at this.

22:01.423 --> 22:04.323
This is old money.
It's Korean War money.

22:04.357 --> 22:07.602
Yes, sir. I was there.
It was a hard time.

22:08.775 --> 22:10.018
I'm sure you know.

22:12.261 --> 22:13.884
Here, you wanna take it?

22:13.918 --> 22:16.818
David. What do you say?

22:16.852 --> 22:19.579
You know, it's funny.
The minute I saw you,

22:20.373 --> 22:22.444
I knew we were gonna be friends.

22:24.239 --> 22:26.275
Can I pray?

22:26.310 --> 22:29.209
- Sorry?
- Just wait a minute.

22:29.244 --> 22:33.697
Thank you.
Thank you, God.

22:34.939 --> 22:37.770
Thank you for the Yi family.

22:37.804 --> 22:39.979
Thank you for this divine appointment.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.189
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.853
Amen! Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

22:55.270 --> 22:57.410
Big things!

22:57.445 --> 23:01.241
You got big things for this family.

23:01.276 --> 23:02.450
Okay.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.934
Mom! Have you looked outside?

23:38.334 --> 23:39.335
How much was it?

23:41.379 --> 23:42.672
It's an investment.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.966
Don't worry. We'll earn it back.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.635
This is how you farm in America.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.430
Why are you laughing?

23:53.266 --> 23:55.518
So, it's not a garden. It's a farm.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.770
Garden, farm, it's all the same.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.648
Just think of it as growing money.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.277
In three years
we can quit chicken sexing.

24:06.821 --> 24:08.948
Just leave enough for David.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.992
That's all I'm asking.

24:11.070 --> 24:12.865
Yeah, of course.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.493
What?

24:21.377 --> 24:22.628
You look happy.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.673
Maybe because Mother is coming?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.806
You look prettiest when you're happy.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.698
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

26:13.781 --> 26:16.409
Isn't it better to grow
American vegetables?

26:18.911 --> 26:24.250
Every year, 30,000 Koreans
immigrate to the US.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.546
-Wouldn't they miss Korean food?
-Yes!

26:30.506 --> 26:32.758
Then how would a Korean farm like ours do?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.846
-Pretty well, right?
-Yes!

26:53.335 --> 26:54.854
You're shy?

26:57.199 --> 26:58.909
Why don't you want Grandma to come?

27:03.873 --> 27:05.624
It's not earwax, it's dirt.

27:17.394 --> 27:18.809
David...

27:18.888 --> 27:21.515
Mommy's dad died during the war.

27:21.599 --> 27:24.852
You know what that means, right?

27:24.935 --> 27:28.522
That's why Mommy
has no brothers or sisters.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.024
Understand?

27:31.192 --> 27:33.110
We're the only family Grandma has.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.905
Can't she come live with us?

27:38.741 --> 27:40.659
Don't touch that. Answer me.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.621
You fight because of Grandma.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.459
If Grandma comes...

27:49.043 --> 27:50.544
Would Mommy and Daddy fight?

27:56.717 --> 27:58.761
My kids are so good-looking!

27:59.303 --> 28:01.013
Stand closer together.

28:01.764 --> 28:02.765
Good!

28:03.391 --> 28:05.601
One, two... Cheese!

28:08.813 --> 28:10.189
Grandma's here.

28:11.137 --> 28:12.829
Wow!

28:12.942 --> 28:13.943
So good-looking!

28:14.068 --> 28:15.277
Grandma's here.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.156
Hello, Grandma!

28:19.042 --> 28:20.043
Oh!

28:19.865 --> 28:23.411
Is this Anne? Already such a lady!

28:25.121 --> 28:26.455
David, say hello to Grandma.

28:27.188 --> 28:29.293
David!

28:27.498 --> 28:28.499
What is this?

28:29.458 --> 28:31.252
Hiding behind your mommy's skirt?

28:31.752 --> 28:34.088
Come on out. It's embarrassing.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.132
Mom.

28:38.509 --> 28:39.552
You're finally here.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.972
You missed me that much?

28:43.389 --> 28:45.724
I really missed you too.

28:47.893 --> 28:50.312
Must've been hard
for you to travel so far.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.110
Here.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.821
Chili powder!

29:00.489 --> 29:01.490
Oh my...

29:01.429 --> 29:02.430
Mmm.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.618
It's so hard to get here.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.204
We even drove eight hours to Dallas.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.664
And it wasn't very good.

29:11.709 --> 29:13.043
You brought anchovies too?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.755
You're crying again?

29:17.465 --> 29:18.466
Because of anchovies?

29:24.388 --> 29:28.267
I'm sorry you have to see
how our life is now.

29:29.226 --> 29:31.604
Why? Because the house has wheels?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.105
It's fun!

29:36.275 --> 29:37.276
Hold on.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.445
Also...

29:41.906 --> 29:42.907
This...

29:44.074 --> 29:46.494
This is something from me, so take it.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.371
No, Mom. I can't.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.624
Take it!

29:51.749 --> 29:53.125
No, Mom. No!

29:53.209 --> 29:54.960
I should be giving you money.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.545
I'm working now!

29:57.171 --> 29:58.172
Just put it away.

30:02.179 --> 30:03.249
David?

30:04.637 --> 30:06.847
Is he ever going to greet Grandma?

30:07.771 --> 30:09.738
David, come.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.228
Is this the one who looks like me?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.483
Are you curious?

30:23.656 --> 30:24.657
Say it louder.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.828
She doesn't look like a grandma?

30:29.912 --> 30:31.914
Oh! Really?

30:31.997 --> 30:34.041
What a good boy!

30:34.124 --> 30:37.044
I'll give you a present
for that compliment!

30:37.127 --> 30:38.170
Let's see.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.588
Here.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.841
You're giving cards to a seven-year-old?

30:42.925 --> 30:46.178
Start him young
to beat those other bastards!

30:48.097 --> 30:49.098
No?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.518
Then I'll give you something else!

30:54.603 --> 30:55.771
It's a chestnut!

30:55.854 --> 30:58.274
Looks yummy! Go on and take it.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.859
He's never eaten this before.

31:00.943 --> 31:01.944
Really?

31:02.027 --> 31:03.529
Wait one second.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.532
You don't have to do that for him.

31:06.615 --> 31:10.327
In case it got stale during
the plane ride.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.831
Here, eat it!

31:13.914 --> 31:15.124
Take it, David.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.626
-Take it. Take it.
-Eat it. Eat it.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.503
-Take it.
-That's a good boy. Eat it.

31:19.587 --> 31:20.921
Say, "Thank you."

31:20.637 --> 31:23.260
Thank you, Grandma. Hmm?

31:25.342 --> 31:28.929
I heard American kids don't like
sharing their rooms.

31:29.013 --> 31:32.182
He's not like that. He's a Korean kid.

32:08.616 --> 32:09.617
You know,

32:11.515 --> 32:14.725
you might wanna think about
doing something out here.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.796
You know...
What?

32:16.831 --> 32:18.695
You know what an exorcism is?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.112
Yeah.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.486
No. No need.

32:26.841 --> 32:28.084
You know...

32:29.050 --> 32:30.465
What happened out here,

32:32.019 --> 32:33.468
it's no good.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.126
Something like that.

32:38.439 --> 32:40.441
Yeah... Real good.

32:41.718 --> 32:42.719
Out!

32:43.720 --> 32:45.549
Out!

32:45.584 --> 32:48.621
Out in the name
of Jesus! Out!

32:49.346 --> 32:50.278
Out!

32:50.313 --> 32:54.627
<i>♪ In the name of Jesus
Out! ♪</i>

32:56.422 --> 32:58.045
Okay.

32:58.079 --> 33:00.702
Now things...
Things will grow.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.466
How come you're putting them
so close together?

33:05.500 --> 33:07.226
You don't wanna put them
so close together like that.

33:07.261 --> 33:09.988
You gotta put them like,
further apart, like that.

33:11.196 --> 33:14.440
No. Is that right?

33:14.475 --> 33:16.028
Yeah, this is right.

33:16.063 --> 33:18.237
Otherwise, you just gonna
grow tiny little lettuces.

33:18.272 --> 33:20.722
You wanna grow like, grow them up!

33:20.757 --> 33:23.173
No, is here to here.

33:23.208 --> 33:27.246
Shoot, man. We'll grow them
the Arkansas way.

33:27.281 --> 33:31.078
You know? You'll be happy.

33:31.112 --> 33:32.527
I'm telling you.

33:35.496 --> 33:36.738
You'll be happy.

33:41.295 --> 33:44.298
<i>♪ You'll be happy
I'll be happy... ♪</i>

33:44.332 --> 33:45.402
Paul.

33:47.611 --> 33:50.235
No, no, no. Get that away from
me in the name of Jesus.

33:50.269 --> 33:52.996
In the name of Jesus, get that
away. Choo, choo, choo.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.275
You crazy, man.
You... You crazy.

33:56.310 --> 33:57.932
Just don't pass those cigarettes to me.

33:57.966 --> 33:59.968
Okay. Just do it. Okay.

34:00.003 --> 34:01.625
Come on, let's get this soil wet.

34:04.214 --> 34:06.078
-Okay, ready?
Yeah.

34:06.113 --> 34:08.149
Wow. Okay.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.363
That's free water.

34:18.307 --> 34:21.518
-What's in it?
-Anything good for you.

34:22.311 --> 34:25.773
It has everything, even deer antlers.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.650
You must've spent a lot.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.659
David, you're so lucky!

34:39.328 --> 34:42.331
-Is this enough?
-That's good, that's good.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.005
That's good.

34:50.881 --> 34:51.965
Here.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.259
-Try some.
-I don't want it.

34:54.343 --> 34:57.596
Drink it. Grandma brought it from Korea.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.766
That's it!

35:01.141 --> 35:04.937
-I don't want it.
-It's expensive. Drink it all.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.817
Good! Such a good boy!

35:10.359 --> 35:12.778
-Grandma...
-Yeah?

35:13.612 --> 35:17.741
In the future,
never, ever bring this again.

35:17.805 --> 35:18.978
Stop, David.

35:19.076 --> 35:21.787
You'll drink one cup every day.

35:22.412 --> 35:23.997
Good job.

35:24.432 --> 35:29.092
Go back!
David, go back to your room!

35:29.127 --> 35:30.162
- Stop!
- David.

35:30.197 --> 35:31.681
David, go to your room.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.234
David, come.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.685
There's a Korea smell!

35:35.719 --> 35:38.205
You've never even been to Korea!

35:38.239 --> 35:40.207
Grandma smells like Korea.

35:40.241 --> 35:41.863
David.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.892
Hey.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.520
What? "Grandma smells?"

35:46.603 --> 35:48.897
Go get the stick.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.649
No?

35:50.732 --> 35:53.402
Then behave in front of Grandma.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.988
Now go to bed.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.704
Go to bed.

36:30.731 --> 36:32.858
What are you making?

36:33.400 --> 36:34.985
Pasta.

36:34.606 --> 36:35.779
Hmm.

36:54.838 --> 36:58.508
Looks tasty. Can Grandma try some?

37:04.739 --> 37:06.810
I want some.

37:06.845 --> 37:08.847
No, this is mine.

37:08.881 --> 37:10.366
Yours is right there.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.110
What's that?

37:17.194 --> 37:19.404
It's water from the mountains.

37:19.488 --> 37:22.366
Dad says it's good for your health.

37:23.116 --> 37:26.286
Then I'll try some.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.040
Grandma?

37:30.123 --> 37:32.501
-Yes?
-You can't cook?

37:32.584 --> 37:34.378
No, I can't.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.214
Can you bake cookies?

37:37.297 --> 37:38.298
No.

37:38.715 --> 37:40.467
Can you bake them?

37:40.842 --> 37:43.720
Then what can you do?

37:43.951 --> 37:45.470
Hmm...

37:46.014 --> 37:47.307
Sucks for you!

37:47.391 --> 37:48.809
Now they're mine!

37:49.059 --> 37:50.686
Out of my way, you bastard!

37:50.769 --> 37:52.020
Watch and learn.

37:52.980 --> 37:54.898
Damn it. Wait.

37:54.982 --> 37:56.191
That's right!

37:56.274 --> 37:57.484
Now, Anne!

37:57.567 --> 37:59.277
Keep playing, keep playing!

37:59.361 --> 38:00.362
Hurry!

38:02.447 --> 38:03.740
A plague on you!

38:03.660 --> 38:04.661
David!

38:07.494 --> 38:08.578
Okay, wait.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.205
Let's see.

38:10.706 --> 38:11.873
Bastard!

38:16.920 --> 38:19.965
Why hasn't anyone started
a Korean church here?

38:21.133 --> 38:23.802
Start a church with fifteen Koreans?

38:23.885 --> 38:28.098
It could be nice.
The Korean kids can play together.

38:28.432 --> 38:30.517
The Koreans around here...

38:30.934 --> 38:34.021
Left the cities for a reason.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.358
To escape Korean church.

38:38.246 --> 38:39.489
Ah...

38:48.878 --> 38:51.121
You know, she can't even read.

38:51.156 --> 38:53.745
She isn't like a real grandma.

38:55.643 --> 38:58.059
You like Grandma.

38:59.026 --> 39:00.096
Thank you.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.319
We shouldn't be so far out here.

39:22.152 --> 39:24.465
David.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.198
It's fine! Just a little further.

39:29.951 --> 39:33.205
This would be a great place.

39:35.582 --> 39:36.583
Grandma.

39:36.666 --> 39:40.420
We shouldn't be here
because of the snakes.

39:41.797 --> 39:45.300
Do you even know what minari is?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.803
You stupid Americans.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.765
I brought some minari seeds from Korea.

39:52.933 --> 39:56.311
We can plant them right over there.

39:56.773 --> 39:59.086
I'm going down.
David!

40:05.821 --> 40:08.657
The minari will grow well here.

40:07.784 --> 40:10.684
David, come up here now!

40:11.374 --> 40:12.927
I'm telling Mom.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.874
Grandma, stop it!

40:17.958 --> 40:19.000
Fine.

40:25.382 --> 40:28.260
That looks tasty. Eat, David.

40:28.677 --> 40:29.970
You too, Anne.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.558
We should plant some minari.

40:34.641 --> 40:38.019
It'll grow well down by the creek.

40:38.603 --> 40:40.522
I'll think about it.

40:40.814 --> 40:44.442
What's there to think about?
I'll just plant it.

40:44.526 --> 40:47.571
Mom, try some of this.

40:45.546 --> 40:46.754
Mmm.

40:47.654 --> 40:52.325
Hey, David. Bring that mountain water.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.994
That's it.

40:53.830 --> 40:55.832
Good boy. Mmm.

40:55.867 --> 40:56.764
Good boy.

40:58.386 --> 40:59.560
Mmm.

41:01.418 --> 41:04.129
You two used to love this song.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.214
This song?

41:06.187 --> 41:07.188
Hmm.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.508
Sure!

41:08.592 --> 41:12.387
Whenever someone made
your mom and dad sing,

41:12.470 --> 41:16.016
they'd get all lovey-dovey
as they sang this song.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.979
Did we?

41:21.062 --> 41:24.900
They come to America
and forget everything.

41:33.325 --> 41:39.497
<i>I love you, darling.</i>

41:39.581 --> 41:44.461
<i>Truly, I love you.</i>

41:45.754 --> 41:49.925
<i>Truly...</i>

41:50.008 --> 41:55.055
<i>I love you.</i>

42:00.769 --> 42:04.189
David, let's pray.

42:06.358 --> 42:10.695
Mommy heard a story about
some kids in Korea...

42:10.779 --> 42:14.324
They prayed to see Heaven before bedtime.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.952
And God heard their prayers.

42:17.035 --> 42:21.039
One kid had a weak heart like you.

42:21.122 --> 42:24.876
When he woke up, he was healed!

42:24.960 --> 42:29.673
Why don't you pray to see Heaven too?

42:29.756 --> 42:34.386
You pray, Mommy. You go and see Heaven.

42:34.469 --> 42:36.554
Mommy can't do it.

42:36.450 --> 42:38.314
Only for kids.

42:39.349 --> 42:40.765
Do you want to try?

42:42.477 --> 42:43.812
Hey!

42:43.895 --> 42:47.732
You make this kid do all sorts of crap!

42:48.316 --> 42:50.277
You scared me!

42:52.737 --> 42:54.572
Okay.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.007
Monica.

43:12.507 --> 43:17.262
Practicing on them is pointless.
They're too old.

43:22.767 --> 43:26.187
You're fast enough for Arkansas.

43:26.479 --> 43:29.983
Don't talk to me
if you're not going to help.

43:54.507 --> 43:57.761
You must be lonely here without friends.

44:00.972 --> 44:06.353
Even with Mother here,
it's not the same thing.

44:07.896 --> 44:11.149
Why are you saying this,
all of a sudden?

44:12.025 --> 44:16.112
I thought we might go to church.

44:29.218 --> 44:30.668
David...

44:30.418 --> 44:33.296
Don't hide it, okay?

44:34.714 --> 44:38.426
Something must be broken down there.

44:38.510 --> 44:41.638
What is his thing called in English?

44:41.721 --> 44:43.223
"Penis."

44:46.768 --> 44:48.186
Mommy...

44:48.269 --> 44:54.317
Sometimes, I dream
I'm peeing in the bathroom,

44:54.401 --> 44:57.487
but I wake up in my bed.

44:58.822 --> 45:01.658
Then ask yourself before you pee,

45:01.319 --> 45:04.598
"Is this a dream?
Is this a dream?"

45:04.702 --> 45:07.831
And pinch yourself like this!

45:06.876 --> 45:08.429
Hmm? Okay?

45:11.639 --> 45:14.608
Penis-uh broken.
Penis-uh broken.

45:14.462 --> 45:15.463
Mom!

45:15.713 --> 45:16.817
It's not called a penis!

45:16.852 --> 45:18.785
It's called a ding-dong!

45:18.819 --> 45:20.027
Huh?

45:21.788 --> 45:24.169
Ding-dong. Ding-dong.

46:06.833 --> 46:07.937
What a wonderful day

46:07.972 --> 46:09.870
to be in the house of the Lord.

46:09.905 --> 46:12.528
If you're here with us
for the first time,

46:12.562 --> 46:13.840
please stand.

46:15.842 --> 46:18.430
Now, don't be ashamed.
Y'all stand up.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.645
What a beautiful family.

46:26.680 --> 46:28.268
I'm glad you're here.

46:29.683 --> 46:32.099
Okay, you can be seated.
Thank you.

46:37.035 --> 46:40.867
Hi, I'm Monica.
- How long y'all been in town?

46:40.901 --> 46:42.316
Uh...
Where you been hiding?

46:42.351 --> 46:44.663
I'm sorry, my English not so good.

46:44.698 --> 46:46.148
Oh, it's okay, we'll teach you English.

46:46.182 --> 46:48.150
You're just too cute!

46:48.184 --> 46:50.773
Thank you!
- Okay.

46:50.808 --> 46:54.087
- Okay, thank you.
- So cute.

46:55.271 --> 46:57.649
There's another one.

46:57.732 --> 47:01.236
So fat! That man is so fat!

47:01.319 --> 47:02.695
Look at him!

47:05.443 --> 47:06.616
Hey.

47:06.651 --> 47:09.723
Can you stop me if I say
something in your language?

47:09.757 --> 47:11.207
Um...

47:11.242 --> 47:12.312
Sure.

47:12.346 --> 47:16.074
Chinga-chinga-chon chama-chama-choo?

47:23.392 --> 47:25.256
Why is your face so flat?

47:25.843 --> 47:27.637
It isn't.

47:30.054 --> 47:33.195
My name is Johnnie.
What's yours?

47:34.334 --> 47:35.645
David.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.268
Nice to meet you, David.

47:40.512 --> 47:41.859
Hey, David.

47:41.893 --> 47:45.276
Blow pomo como lomo?

47:45.310 --> 47:47.899
Oh. <i>Como...</i>

47:47.934 --> 47:50.246
That means aunt in Korean.

47:50.971 --> 47:52.800
That is so neat!

48:01.421 --> 48:03.798
Can I sleep over at his house?

48:03.881 --> 48:06.217
You should sleep at home, with Grandma.

48:06.918 --> 48:08.264
But I don't like Grandma!

48:09.178 --> 48:10.430
Don't say that.

48:11.819 --> 48:15.202
No? Why can't you?

48:15.237 --> 48:16.272
Why?

48:17.964 --> 48:20.552
Broken ding-dong.
Ding-dong broken.

48:29.115 --> 48:32.452
Let's just work on Sundays.

48:33.453 --> 48:37.790
Then why did you give so much money.

48:58.436 --> 49:00.229
Is that Paul?

49:05.287 --> 49:08.014
Paul, what are you doing?

49:09.463 --> 49:13.709
It's, uh... It's Sunday.
This is my church.

49:15.228 --> 49:17.678
Okay.
Do you need a ride?

49:19.232 --> 49:20.958
No, I gotta finish this.

49:21.648 --> 49:22.994
I'll see you Monday.

49:37.664 --> 49:39.183
See you, Paul.

49:42.021 --> 49:43.356
What?

49:43.439 --> 49:46.359
You like Jesus too.

49:54.242 --> 49:57.495
Look at those muscles!

50:00.540 --> 50:04.127
My, my! That's impressive.

50:05.837 --> 50:09.340
Grandma, you're not a real grandma.

50:09.841 --> 50:11.300
What is a real grandma?

50:11.384 --> 50:14.262
They bake cookies! They don't swear!

50:14.345 --> 50:16.347
They don't wear men's underwear!

50:16.431 --> 50:17.432
Really?

50:18.224 --> 50:19.600
Don't do that!

50:20.309 --> 50:23.438
Go get some mountain water.
Let's drink that.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.356
-No.
-No?

50:25.440 --> 50:26.941
Come here.

50:27.748 --> 50:31.407
Pretty boy!
Pretty boy! Pretty...

50:31.442 --> 50:33.582
I'm not pretty!
I'm good-looking!

50:38.119 --> 50:39.162
Oh, my!

50:39.245 --> 50:41.706
He's hitting him again. And again!

50:41.789 --> 50:44.250
Someone could get killed!

51:06.028 --> 51:09.169
It is a dream.
This isn't real.

51:22.596 --> 51:26.083
Good boy!
Good boy! Good boy! Good boy!

51:26.117 --> 51:29.120
Good boy! Good boy.

51:43.726 --> 51:45.436
You little bastard!

51:46.729 --> 51:48.981
Come back here, you little bastard!

52:25.518 --> 52:27.812
Raise your hands!

52:30.273 --> 52:32.817
Keep them apart.

52:44.453 --> 52:45.705
Come on!

52:45.788 --> 52:47.206
Keep them up!

52:48.833 --> 52:51.377
Raise them straight.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.632
That's enough.

52:56.716 --> 52:59.719
Now apologize to Grandma.

53:00.761 --> 53:02.555
Sorry...

53:02.805 --> 53:05.308
You call that an apology?

53:05.391 --> 53:06.976
Do it properly!

53:07.059 --> 53:09.353
She's not even a real grandma...

53:09.462 --> 53:10.463
David!

53:10.730 --> 53:12.773
It's okay, it's okay!

53:12.857 --> 53:15.443
Just don't do it again, okay?

53:15.526 --> 53:20.072
I'll try to be a real grandma
from now on.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.437
Okay?

53:20.156 --> 53:21.991
Go get the stick.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.118
Why would you hit him?

53:24.660 --> 53:26.203
Get the stick.

53:35.087 --> 53:38.716
Why would you hit such a sweet boy?

53:38.799 --> 53:40.301
He's only a child!

53:40.384 --> 53:42.345
Who cares if I drank a little pee?

53:42.428 --> 53:45.014
-It was fun!
-Mom!

54:07.328 --> 54:09.246
Go outside and get a new one.

54:43.155 --> 54:45.449
I'll do better. I'll do better.

54:45.533 --> 54:48.661
Mom, it's bad enough
you're in this hillbilly place.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.496
Why "hillbilly" place?

54:50.579 --> 54:53.708
It's hillbilly,
so David lost all his manners.

54:53.791 --> 54:57.169
Just because you're from the city
doesn't make you better.

54:57.253 --> 54:59.380
You two will fight over anything!

55:09.598 --> 55:10.808
Let's see.

55:14.770 --> 55:16.397
My, my!

55:16.480 --> 55:18.274
Such a clever boy.

55:18.357 --> 55:20.026
Good job.

55:20.109 --> 55:21.277
You won.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.487
You're the real winner!

56:55.653 --> 56:57.206
-Paul.
Yeah.

56:58.898 --> 57:00.865
Why is this so dry?

57:00.900 --> 57:02.073
It is dry.

57:03.074 --> 57:05.214
Is that dry over there?

57:05.249 --> 57:07.458
Yeah, it's pretty much dry all over.

57:15.362 --> 57:19.470
This one, too.
There's no water. Bone dry.

57:20.367 --> 57:22.059
We better check that well.

57:30.585 --> 57:32.207
If it's water table well,

57:33.691 --> 57:35.244
you won't get much further.

57:38.558 --> 57:42.217
You know, if you wanted,
you could try with this.

57:42.251 --> 57:43.287
You could try with these guys.

57:43.321 --> 57:44.978
You ever see one of these guys?

57:47.533 --> 57:50.018
Oh, not there. Not there.

57:53.573 --> 57:55.264
We need to find water somewhere.

57:59.061 --> 58:01.305
If that soil ain't wet,
you're gonna lose the crop.

58:14.200 --> 58:17.953
Monica. Will you help me?

58:20.206 --> 58:23.167
-I must've worked too hard.
-Does it hurt a lot?

58:23.250 --> 58:25.252
I can't raise my arms any higher.

58:34.511 --> 58:36.180
I need to wash my hair...

58:48.901 --> 58:51.362
Working outdoors makes me feel alive.

58:51.804 --> 58:52.805
Ow!

58:53.697 --> 58:55.991
Why do you always pinch me like that?

58:59.078 --> 59:00.913
We're losing so much money.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.123
I'm worried.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.210
Everything will be fine.

59:14.969 --> 59:16.428
I'll take care of us.

59:18.013 --> 59:21.183
Coming to this "hillbilly place"
was for our family.

59:24.103 --> 59:25.729
And if the farm fails...

59:27.064 --> 59:29.608
You can do what you want.

59:30.526 --> 59:32.736
You could even leave with the kids.

59:45.249 --> 59:46.792
Lean forward.

1:01:24.784 --> 1:01:27.338
There's some good stuff out here,

1:01:27.373 --> 1:01:28.961
Mr. Jacob Yi.

1:01:31.722 --> 1:01:34.449
There's some good stuff
out here, Mr. Jacob Yi.

1:01:35.519 --> 1:01:37.107
Oh, it's so beautiful.

1:01:37.970 --> 1:01:40.731
It's so beautiful,
Mr. Jacob Yi.

1:01:40.766 --> 1:01:43.320
I think we better send it to Dallas.

1:01:44.390 --> 1:01:45.909
- Paul.
- Yeah?

1:01:46.633 --> 1:01:47.807
Good job.

1:01:52.294 --> 1:01:53.468
Very good job.

1:01:55.504 --> 1:01:58.197
Good job.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:00.751
Good job.

1:02:02.546 --> 1:02:05.066
Okay, that's...
That's enough.

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:28.078
Hello, sir.

1:02:31.039 --> 1:02:34.585
Yes, the order is ready.
We'll send it this weekend.

1:02:40.342 --> 1:02:41.343
Uh...

1:02:44.970 --> 1:02:46.680
But we've already started...

1:02:52.728 --> 1:02:54.146
All right.

1:02:55.219 --> 1:02:59.189
Paul! Come on!
- What?

1:02:59.223 --> 1:03:02.399
Take it back!
- What for?

1:03:02.433 --> 1:03:03.469
Put it back.

1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:06.783
What happened?

1:03:09.371 --> 1:03:10.545
Take it back?

1:03:17.207 --> 1:03:18.829
Whoa...

1:03:18.864 --> 1:03:20.935
Where are they getting
their produce at?

1:03:22.522 --> 1:03:23.592
California.

1:03:25.698 --> 1:03:28.735
They just change it like that on you?

1:03:28.770 --> 1:03:33.223
You know,
we still got some time, Jacob.

1:03:33.257 --> 1:03:35.328
You know, we'll find someplace else.

1:03:36.467 --> 1:03:38.124
It ain't rotting on the vines.

1:03:38.159 --> 1:03:41.990
Korean people, big city,
you never trust them!

1:03:42.025 --> 1:03:44.613
Well, forget...
Just forget about Dallas.

1:03:44.648 --> 1:03:45.822
Forget about Dallas.

1:03:45.856 --> 1:03:49.446
There's always Oklahoma City.
Or Memphis...

1:03:52.725 --> 1:03:54.313
I'm still paying for water!

1:03:55.486 --> 1:03:56.694
We'll try and get the...

1:03:57.799 --> 1:04:00.008
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

1:04:00.043 --> 1:04:03.736
I have to go to work, okay?
To go to work.

1:04:03.770 --> 1:04:05.462
It's gonna be all right!

1:04:32.202 --> 1:04:33.662
Finished already?

1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:35.043
Oh.

1:04:39.001 --> 1:04:40.586
Someone could get killed.

1:04:41.461 --> 1:04:42.629
My, my...

1:04:42.292 --> 1:04:44.915
David. David!

1:04:45.951 --> 1:04:48.332
David, go change.
It's time to go.

1:04:48.367 --> 1:04:50.403
Where?
Church picnic.

1:04:51.430 --> 1:04:54.641
Grandma, please help him change.

1:04:55.183 --> 1:04:57.519
Who cares what a little boy wears?

1:05:14.286 --> 1:05:16.413
Grandma, the water isn't working.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:30.469
-Your arms still hurt?
-I'm fine.

1:05:33.597 --> 1:05:35.015
Just leave it.

1:05:35.724 --> 1:05:37.643
If they're injured, we throw them away.

1:05:46.193 --> 1:05:48.362
Anne! Grandma!

1:05:50.447 --> 1:05:52.366
Anne! Grandma!

1:05:56.244 --> 1:05:57.579
What is it?

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:01.500
My goodness!

1:06:01.583 --> 1:06:03.251
Hurry! Get a towel!

1:06:04.586 --> 1:06:07.130
Anne, snap out of it! Get a towel!

1:06:17.766 --> 1:06:19.768
The church bus is here.

1:06:19.851 --> 1:06:21.895
You go ahead, without David.

1:06:23.393 --> 1:06:26.120
This just gets better and better.

1:06:26.858 --> 1:06:28.235
There we go.

1:06:29.152 --> 1:06:30.654
Which drawer attacked you?

1:06:33.156 --> 1:06:35.409
You lifted that heavy thing?

1:06:35.867 --> 1:06:37.661
And you put it back, all by yourself?

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:40.372
Goodness.

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:44.418
Okay. Try standing up.

1:06:45.293 --> 1:06:47.838
There you go. Good.

1:06:49.108 --> 1:06:50.799
Okay. Okay.

1:06:50.924 --> 1:06:52.342
Now, try walking.

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:56.430
Oh, my!

1:06:56.943 --> 1:07:00.395
Strong!
Strong boy! Mmm!

1:07:00.430 --> 1:07:02.328
Strong boy. Mmm!

1:07:03.729 --> 1:07:04.771
What?

1:07:05.147 --> 1:07:06.940
No one's ever said that to you?

1:07:07.983 --> 1:07:11.778
David. You're a strong boy.

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:15.198
You're the strongest boy
Grandma's ever seen!

1:07:18.368 --> 1:07:19.953
-Grandma.
-Yeah?

1:07:20.662 --> 1:07:23.039
What does pee taste like?

1:07:23.749 --> 1:07:25.167
You rascal!

1:07:32.591 --> 1:07:34.217
The weather is nice.

1:07:35.469 --> 1:07:38.930
Grandma! You can walk faster like this!

1:07:39.014 --> 1:07:40.223
I can?

1:07:41.141 --> 1:07:44.186
Goodness. You might as well run.

1:07:46.646 --> 1:07:48.857
You do that because you shouldn't run?

1:07:50.192 --> 1:07:52.068
You want to run, don't you?

1:07:54.404 --> 1:07:58.909
Why don't we try
running to that tree together?

1:08:01.161 --> 1:08:03.413
I don't think I can.

1:08:04.039 --> 1:08:05.957
It's okay, it's okay.

1:08:06.041 --> 1:08:07.250
Let's just go.

1:08:08.752 --> 1:08:10.253
Slowly.

1:08:13.965 --> 1:08:15.842
Let's go slowly.

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:27.479
Careful. Careful.

1:08:30.065 --> 1:08:32.108
The minari is growing well!

1:08:33.860 --> 1:08:38.657
David, you've never eaten
minari before, huh?

1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:42.702
Minari is truly the best.

1:08:43.578 --> 1:08:47.207
It grows anywhere, like weeds.

1:08:47.457 --> 1:08:49.835
So anyone can pick and eat it.

1:08:50.669 --> 1:08:55.590
Rich or poor,
anyone can enjoy it and be healthy.

1:08:56.466 --> 1:09:02.806
Minari can be put in kimchi,
put in stew, put in soup.

1:09:03.390 --> 1:09:06.226
It can be medicine if you are sick.

1:09:06.434 --> 1:09:10.230
Minari is wonderful, wonderful!

1:09:12.182 --> 1:09:15.496
<i>♪ Minari, minari, minari</i>

1:09:15.530 --> 1:09:20.086
♪ <i>Wonderful, wonderful minari ♪</i>

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:21.575
That's right!

1:09:21.260 --> 1:09:24.332
Wonderful, wonderful minari.

1:09:25.203 --> 1:09:26.663
Is that a minari song?

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:32.961
The wind is blowing
and the minari is bowing.

1:09:33.420 --> 1:09:36.172
They're saying thank you very much!

1:09:42.679 --> 1:09:44.389
Grandma! Look at that!

1:09:46.725 --> 1:09:49.644
Stop. David! Leave it alone!

1:09:49.728 --> 1:09:51.938
It might crawl away and hide!

1:09:52.939 --> 1:09:54.190
David.

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:57.861
It's better to see it
than to have it hide.

1:09:59.571 --> 1:10:02.616
Things that hide
are more dangerous and scary.

1:10:14.586 --> 1:10:17.547
-There's been no water all day?
-Yeah.

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:29.517
I should check the pipes.

1:10:39.069 --> 1:10:40.946
He thinks I don't know.

1:10:41.529 --> 1:10:45.200
We can't afford more water.
He used it all on the crops.

1:10:46.201 --> 1:10:48.078
What are we going to do?

1:10:51.831 --> 1:10:53.875
I'm sure we'll borrow more
from the bank.

1:10:58.088 --> 1:11:00.340
Daddy, where are you going?

1:11:00.428 --> 1:11:02.188
I wanna come, too.

1:11:03.426 --> 1:11:05.762
No. Go inside.

1:11:08.765 --> 1:11:09.975
Mom.

1:11:10.725 --> 1:11:13.186
I'll take care of our family.

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:16.231
Don't work too hard.

1:11:21.611 --> 1:11:23.571
So, where did you get all that water?

1:11:24.739 --> 1:11:27.867
David and I hauled it over
from the minari creek.

1:11:28.451 --> 1:11:32.163
David is stronger than you think,
you know.

1:11:32.914 --> 1:11:36.167
He's not supposed to do things like that.

1:11:38.378 --> 1:11:43.008
You remember Cousin Doo-won?
That big, dumb kid.

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:46.386
At David's age, he was much weaker.

1:11:47.012 --> 1:11:48.638
You don't understand, Mom.

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:52.767
Getting hurt is all part of growing up.

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:54.894
Even the doctors are worried.

1:11:55.979 --> 1:11:58.148
His heart could stop at any moment.

1:12:39.522 --> 1:12:40.857
What are you doing?

1:12:43.777 --> 1:12:45.987
Why aren't you sleeping? What's wrong?

1:12:49.491 --> 1:12:56.331
Mommy said if I pray,
I can see Heaven in my sleep.

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:02.253
Like those kids who prayed
to see Heaven?

1:13:08.927 --> 1:13:10.804
Are you scared?

1:13:16.643 --> 1:13:20.063
It's all right.
You don't have to go see Heaven.

1:13:20.647 --> 1:13:22.524
Saying such nonsense to a kid.

1:13:24.442 --> 1:13:27.821
But... I already prayed.

1:13:28.113 --> 1:13:31.074
I already asked to see it.

1:13:31.282 --> 1:13:34.285
But now, I don't want to go.

1:13:37.622 --> 1:13:39.332
Then David...

1:13:43.336 --> 1:13:45.004
Pray this instead.

1:13:47.250 --> 1:13:50.909
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:13:50.969 --> 1:13:53.304
"No thank you... Heaven."

1:13:53.805 --> 1:13:56.141
But what if I go to Hell?

1:13:57.767 --> 1:14:00.061
Why are you worrying about
that already?

1:14:03.898 --> 1:14:06.151
I don't want to die.

1:14:09.487 --> 1:14:11.531
Come here, David.

1:14:12.157 --> 1:14:13.408
Grandma won't...

1:14:14.117 --> 1:14:18.413
Grandma won't let you die.

1:14:19.038 --> 1:14:23.418
Who? Who dares to scare
my grandson like this?

1:14:23.626 --> 1:14:26.296
Don't worry. Grandma won't let you die.

1:14:27.297 --> 1:14:29.257
Who dares?

1:14:30.592 --> 1:14:32.010
You'll be fine.

1:14:32.594 --> 1:14:35.305
You don't have to see Heaven.

Hmm.

1:16:36.968 --> 1:16:38.136
Grandma?

1:16:39.429 --> 1:16:40.680
Grandma!

1:16:41.889 --> 1:16:44.976
Grandma, why did you wet the bed?

1:17:13.974 --> 1:17:16.148
Why is she like that?

1:17:16.183 --> 1:17:19.255
We'll call Mom from church.
Get dressed.

1:17:30.162 --> 1:17:32.302
When Jesus comes again,

1:17:33.545 --> 1:17:36.065
what a glorious day that's gonna be.

1:17:37.860 --> 1:17:40.656
But what are you gonna say
when He asks...

1:17:40.690 --> 1:17:43.244
I'm going to go call Mom, okay?

1:17:43.279 --> 1:17:44.625
Okay.

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:46.385
...Sue from the bank...

1:17:46.420 --> 1:17:47.697
Excuse me.

1:17:47.732 --> 1:17:49.181
...why is Earl
from the grocery store

1:17:49.216 --> 1:17:50.251
not with us?

1:17:51.390 --> 1:17:53.807
Why didn't you preach
the good news of salvation

1:17:53.841 --> 1:17:55.740
to those precious people?

1:18:06.095 --> 1:18:07.475
David...

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:10.895
Mom took Grandma to the hospital.

1:18:11.203 --> 1:18:13.689
When will they come home?

1:18:14.724 --> 1:18:16.070
I don't know.

1:18:24.838 --> 1:18:26.805
There's that cross guy.

1:18:38.403 --> 1:18:39.542
You think he saw?

1:18:39.576 --> 1:18:42.027
I heard he got dirt floors
and he shits in a bucket.

1:18:42.062 --> 1:18:43.753
He got no water where he lives.

1:18:48.391 --> 1:18:50.101
Was church good?

1:18:51.269 --> 1:18:52.270
Yes.

1:18:52.353 --> 1:18:54.814
-There's no water?
-Not yet.

1:18:55.148 --> 1:18:56.524
That's not good...

1:18:56.649 --> 1:18:58.776
I can get more from the minari creek.

1:18:59.148 --> 1:19:00.149
<i>Oh.</i>

1:19:01.070 --> 1:19:05.074
Stay with your friends tonight,
but be careful.

1:19:05.491 --> 1:19:06.784
We will.

1:19:07.915 --> 1:19:09.675
How's Grandma?

1:19:09.710 --> 1:19:11.539
Mom said we could stay with friends.

1:19:11.574 --> 1:19:12.817
Really?

1:19:15.267 --> 1:19:17.442
My mom's friend keeps this here.

1:19:17.476 --> 1:19:19.271
He don't mind.

1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:31.767
Wanna try some?

1:19:33.734 --> 1:19:35.322
Does it hurt?

1:19:35.978 --> 1:19:37.324
Put it like this.

1:19:47.023 --> 1:19:50.337
It only hurts if you eat it.
So don't eat it, stupid!

1:19:54.134 --> 1:19:55.929
I'm a cowboy!

1:20:04.144 --> 1:20:05.973
You won't get points that way.

1:20:06.008 --> 1:20:09.183
Get a junk card.
You'll get more money.

1:20:10.564 --> 1:20:12.255
- This one?
- Yeah!

1:20:14.769 --> 1:20:16.562
Out of my way, you bastard!

1:20:16.881 --> 1:20:18.468
This is a great game.

1:20:19.021 --> 1:20:20.298
Yeah.

1:21:06.137 --> 1:21:08.553
All right, boys, breakfast

1:21:09.899 --> 1:21:11.936
is right here.

1:21:13.489 --> 1:21:14.593
There you go.

1:21:14.628 --> 1:21:17.389
Come here, boo. Give me a hug.
Come on over here.

1:21:17.424 --> 1:21:19.633
Come here.

1:21:19.667 --> 1:21:22.325
Get over here. Let me look
at you. You sleep good?

1:21:22.947 --> 1:21:24.707
That's your buddy, huh?

1:21:24.741 --> 1:21:26.709
Hey, it's good to meet you.

1:21:26.743 --> 1:21:28.607
Go on, eat your breakfast.

1:21:33.785 --> 1:21:35.649
How's your daddy like that new farm?

1:21:37.789 --> 1:21:38.997
Hmm?

1:21:39.584 --> 1:21:40.585
Good.

1:21:41.897 --> 1:21:44.416
He growing things good,
doing things right?

1:21:44.451 --> 1:21:45.486
Yes.

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.350
That's good.

1:21:50.526 --> 1:21:52.631
I knew the fella who was there before.

1:21:53.943 --> 1:21:56.773
- Who?
- Bucky Reed.

1:21:56.808 --> 1:21:58.223
He went flat broke.

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:01.088
Boom.

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.471
I guess it's what a man does.

1:22:09.545 --> 1:22:11.409
You tell your mom I was here all night.

1:22:11.443 --> 1:22:12.513
Okay.

1:22:14.481 --> 1:22:17.656
And you help your dad
on that farm. All right?

1:22:19.003 --> 1:22:20.314
You hear me?

1:22:23.041 --> 1:22:24.249
All right, Johnnie,

1:22:24.284 --> 1:22:26.079
I'll see you
in a little while, all right?

1:22:26.113 --> 1:22:27.390
I'm going to work.

1:23:23.374 --> 1:23:24.709
Grandma...

1:23:35.344 --> 1:23:37.972
What are you looking at, Grandma?

1:23:40.307 --> 1:23:41.809
Leave it...

1:23:41.892 --> 1:23:44.061
It will hide...will hide.

1:23:52.403 --> 1:23:54.071
Anne, come over here.

1:24:01.579 --> 1:24:03.330
What's wrong with Grandma?

1:24:06.417 --> 1:24:10.171
Grandma had a stroke, she needs to rest.

1:24:11.380 --> 1:24:13.007
Why did it happen?

1:24:15.050 --> 1:24:16.677
It's my fault.

1:24:17.178 --> 1:24:19.513
This happened because I was selfish.

1:24:21.182 --> 1:24:23.642
Grandma will be okay, Mom.

1:24:26.103 --> 1:24:29.857
My daughter's so grown-up.
Worrying about her mom.

1:24:32.026 --> 1:24:34.403
Always looking after her brother, too.

1:24:35.529 --> 1:24:36.864
I'm sorry.

1:24:40.242 --> 1:24:42.119
I won't let this happen again.

1:24:47.047 --> 1:24:49.084
Mom wants to go back to California

1:24:49.118 --> 1:24:50.464
because of Grandma.

1:24:51.776 --> 1:24:52.777
When?

1:24:54.572 --> 1:24:58.300
First, they're going to check
your heart, and then decide.

1:25:00.405 --> 1:25:03.132
Would you rather live with Mom or Dad?

1:25:04.547 --> 1:25:05.617
I don't know.

1:25:06.584 --> 1:25:07.757
Me neither.

1:25:17.388 --> 1:25:19.252
David. David.

1:25:20.667 --> 1:25:21.702
Paul.

1:25:21.737 --> 1:25:24.188
Oh. Thank you so much.

1:25:33.337 --> 1:25:34.755
David, help Grandma.

1:25:37.304 --> 1:25:38.133
David

1:25:37.925 --> 1:25:39.468
I told you to help Grandma.

1:25:40.386 --> 1:25:41.929
Here, Mom.

1:25:43.389 --> 1:25:46.725
For... David... Him...him.

1:25:52.250 --> 1:25:55.736
Hmm.
Oh, sorry.

1:25:55.771 --> 1:25:59.223
But don't put that kimchi too
far away. I like it.

1:25:59.257 --> 1:26:00.396
Oh!

1:26:00.431 --> 1:26:03.434
It made me sweat on my head.

1:26:03.468 --> 1:26:05.505
- You know?
- You okay?

1:26:05.539 --> 1:26:06.540
I'm good.

1:26:13.409 --> 1:26:15.273
You're our first guest here.

1:26:15.308 --> 1:26:16.723
I'm honored.

1:26:23.074 --> 1:26:24.213
Hmm.

1:26:40.885 --> 1:26:41.886
Hmm.

1:26:55.071 --> 1:26:57.212
I'm gonna put some oil in here.

1:27:00.076 --> 1:27:03.356
Paul, she sees something here.

1:27:03.390 --> 1:27:04.805
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:27:07.532 --> 1:27:08.533
Look out.

1:27:09.362 --> 1:27:10.984
Look out, it's gonna...

1:27:15.091 --> 1:27:16.610
Cast you out!

1:27:17.542 --> 1:27:21.546
Cast you out!
Cast you out!

1:27:21.581 --> 1:27:24.894
Hear our prayer, oh, Heavenly Father.

1:27:24.929 --> 1:27:29.278
Hear this prayer. Come down,
Jesus, to me, oh, Lord.

1:27:29.313 --> 1:27:33.248
Only you can heal.
Only you can heal her.

1:27:36.251 --> 1:27:38.701
It feels different, doesn't it?

1:27:38.736 --> 1:27:40.013
Mmm, yeah.

1:27:40.047 --> 1:27:43.085
It feels like, lighter.
Yes, yes.

1:27:43.119 --> 1:27:44.707
I feel light.
Ah!

1:27:44.742 --> 1:27:47.710
Thank you. Thank you, Paul.
Thank you so much.

1:27:47.745 --> 1:27:50.851
Thank you.
Uh, wait here.

1:27:50.886 --> 1:27:53.544
I have something here. Yeah.
Okay.

1:28:01.276 --> 1:28:02.449
Hey.

1:28:06.626 --> 1:28:09.698
Do you...
Do you want me to...

1:28:10.423 --> 1:28:12.873
To pray for you and...

1:28:14.047 --> 1:28:15.290
If you want.

1:28:18.707 --> 1:28:19.777
Why?

1:28:21.123 --> 1:28:22.297
No need.

1:28:24.989 --> 1:28:25.886
I meant...

1:28:25.921 --> 1:28:28.855
Come early tomorrow, okay?
Lot of work.

1:28:32.808 --> 1:28:36.145
You said he was strange,
now you ask him to do this?

1:28:36.437 --> 1:28:37.563
When did I say that?

1:28:38.105 --> 1:28:40.607
He wanted to help us.
We should be grateful.

1:28:42.609 --> 1:28:44.236
What did you tell him about us?

1:28:45.112 --> 1:28:46.572
Why would I tell him anything?

1:29:11.430 --> 1:29:13.766
It's your fault, Grandma.

1:29:13.849 --> 1:29:15.976
It's all because of you.

1:29:16.268 --> 1:29:18.562
You shouldn't have come to America.

1:29:26.222 --> 1:29:27.983
<i>108 degrees today,</i>

1:29:28.017 --> 1:29:30.365
<i>which beats the record
all to smithereens.</i>

1:29:30.399 --> 1:29:33.091
<i>It was 101 set way on back in the 50s.</i>

1:29:33.126 --> 1:29:35.680
<i>Let's take a look right now
at the full heat wave.</i>

1:29:35.715 --> 1:29:38.303
<i>There it is,
17 days' worth. And...</i>

1:29:38.457 --> 1:29:40.042
Mom, look over here.

1:29:40.501 --> 1:29:44.046
There's food in the fridge.
No need to heat it up, okay?

1:29:47.466 --> 1:29:49.343
It's okay. You don't have to help.

1:29:50.094 --> 1:29:52.429
Watch TV and rest. We'll be home late.

1:29:52.352 --> 1:29:53.595
Mmm-hmm.

1:29:55.808 --> 1:29:57.309
Don't worry.

1:30:00.729 --> 1:30:02.189
Thank you so much, Mom.

1:30:04.608 --> 1:30:06.902
We'll be back.

1:30:06.297 --> 1:30:07.540
Hmm.

1:30:10.784 --> 1:30:13.615
You're good. This one's good.

1:30:15.237 --> 1:30:16.618
-This one's good.
Okay.

1:30:16.652 --> 1:30:17.964
They're all good.

1:30:19.586 --> 1:30:20.622
Wait, wait, wait.

1:30:20.656 --> 1:30:23.556
Okay, just one more thing.

1:30:27.042 --> 1:30:27.939
It's good. What do you think

1:30:27.974 --> 1:30:29.527
they're gonna say when they see that?

1:30:32.875 --> 1:30:34.463
Jacob.

1:30:34.498 --> 1:30:36.776
This good.
Okay, this good.

1:30:38.674 --> 1:30:41.263
It's good. Yes.

1:30:41.297 --> 1:30:42.471
Hey.

1:30:43.714 --> 1:30:47.442
They won't say no.
They won't say no.

1:30:47.476 --> 1:30:49.478
Okay. Okay.

1:30:49.513 --> 1:30:50.893
I love these.

1:30:52.757 --> 1:30:55.967
It's a very exciting move.
It's a very important move.

1:30:56.002 --> 1:30:57.003
Jacob...

1:30:58.073 --> 1:31:00.006
- O... Okay.
- Yes!

1:32:02.768 --> 1:32:04.978
You're bringing that inside?

1:32:05.646 --> 1:32:07.481
It's too hot out here.

1:32:07.564 --> 1:32:09.816
Where will you put it?

1:32:11.026 --> 1:32:12.569
Okay.

1:32:12.653 --> 1:32:16.531
I'll park downstairs. Go ahead.

1:32:16.615 --> 1:32:19.743
We're here for David.

1:32:19.826 --> 1:32:22.162
Okay. Go on in.

1:32:36.654 --> 1:32:38.035
Thank you.

1:32:53.119 --> 1:32:54.189
All right.

1:32:55.535 --> 1:32:57.054
All right, buddy.

1:32:58.020 --> 1:32:59.366
You can sit up, get dressed,

1:32:59.401 --> 1:33:01.506
and go wait in the waiting room.
How's that sound?

1:33:01.541 --> 1:33:04.544
- Good. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:33:13.797 --> 1:33:15.674
Is he okay?

1:33:16.383 --> 1:33:18.510
We don't know.

1:33:19.428 --> 1:33:21.972
The doctor will tell us.

1:33:22.931 --> 1:33:25.976
Here we go. Good job!

1:33:52.044 --> 1:33:57.007
Life was so difficult in Korea.

1:34:01.928 --> 1:34:05.891
Remember what we said
when we got married?

1:34:07.309 --> 1:34:11.563
That we'd go to America
and save each other.

1:34:14.608 --> 1:34:16.943
I remember.

1:34:20.030 --> 1:34:23.492
Instead of saving each other

1:34:24.284 --> 1:34:29.790
all we did was fight.
Is that why he's sick?

1:34:40.258 --> 1:34:42.552
Jacob.

1:34:43.053 --> 1:34:45.764
Can't you come with us?

1:34:47.140 --> 1:34:49.810
I can't do this without you.

1:34:50.519 --> 1:34:53.605
You're the one who wants to leave.

1:34:57.317 --> 1:34:59.361
We'll go broke living here.

1:34:59.444 --> 1:35:02.697
In California, we could easily
pay off our debt.

1:35:02.781 --> 1:35:05.784
By chicken sexing until we die.

1:35:05.867 --> 1:35:08.328
Think about the kids.

1:35:08.412 --> 1:35:13.291
They need to see me
succeed at something for once.

1:35:15.794 --> 1:35:17.963
For what?

1:35:18.922 --> 1:35:22.259
Isn't it more important that
we stay together?

1:35:31.768 --> 1:35:37.232
You go ahead and do what you want.

1:35:40.861 --> 1:35:47.826
Even if I fail,
I have to finish what I started.

1:35:54.818 --> 1:35:56.509
Mr. and Mrs. Yi?

1:35:56.543 --> 1:35:58.097
Ready to see you now.

1:36:02.966 --> 1:36:05.469
Kids. Let's go.

1:36:06.657 --> 1:36:07.796
Okay, see,

1:36:07.831 --> 1:36:09.729
this is where blood flows out,
like a door.

1:36:09.764 --> 1:36:12.111
Open, close, open, close.

1:36:12.145 --> 1:36:14.182
You see how close the hole is here?

1:36:14.216 --> 1:36:16.149
Now this is why the California
doctor wanted to wait

1:36:16.184 --> 1:36:18.807
till he's a bit older before surgery.

1:36:18.842 --> 1:36:21.154
But, and are you ready?

1:36:21.189 --> 1:36:23.916
It looks like the hole
is getting smaller.

1:36:25.572 --> 1:36:27.920
- What?
- It's still there,

1:36:27.954 --> 1:36:29.956
but in comparing measurements,

1:36:29.991 --> 1:36:32.752
it's a significant improvement.

1:36:32.787 --> 1:36:34.927
All right, this means
we can rule out surgery,

1:36:34.961 --> 1:36:37.826
and we can see if the hole
closes up on its own.

1:36:40.070 --> 1:36:42.072
This is very good news.

1:36:42.106 --> 1:36:45.454
But sound has gotten louder.

1:36:45.489 --> 1:36:48.285
Yes. Sometimes,
as the hole gets smaller,

1:36:48.319 --> 1:36:49.838
the sound gets louder.

1:36:49.873 --> 1:36:51.115
Loud is good.

1:36:53.221 --> 1:36:54.878
Are we happy?

1:36:54.912 --> 1:36:59.399
Yes, I'm happy.
Thank you.

1:36:59.439 --> 1:37:02.442
Good job!

1:37:01.229 --> 1:37:03.231
Must be the Ozark water.

1:37:03.265 --> 1:37:06.337
Whatever it is you're doing,
don't change a thing.

1:37:10.408 --> 1:37:11.576
Good!

1:37:40.814 --> 1:37:43.483
Look, it's kimbap!

1:37:43.927 --> 1:37:45.825
Hey, what are these?

1:37:45.860 --> 1:37:47.965
I'm guessing some kind of...

1:37:48.989 --> 1:37:50.699
Beans?

1:37:50.830 --> 1:37:52.349
Or maybe it's seeds.

1:37:52.383 --> 1:37:53.626
It kind of looks like peanuts.

1:37:53.702 --> 1:37:56.413
-Anne, don't touch it.
-Okay.

1:37:56.387 --> 1:37:59.218
Kinda looks like
peanuts chopped in half.

1:37:59.252 --> 1:38:00.253
Yeah.

1:38:01.376 --> 1:38:04.462
It's a very good idea.

1:38:04.546 --> 1:38:09.634
Many Koreans are moving to Oklahoma City.

1:38:09.718 --> 1:38:13.722
Yes, and most of your produce
comes from California.

1:38:13.805 --> 1:38:17.726
It arrives in worse shape
and doesn't taste as good.

1:38:17.809 --> 1:38:20.770
We're only five hours away.

1:38:21.187 --> 1:38:22.355
Very good.

1:38:22.439 --> 1:38:23.690
Then...

1:38:24.316 --> 1:38:26.651
When should we start?

1:38:27.277 --> 1:38:29.571
Let's start next week.

1:38:29.006 --> 1:38:30.042
Okay.

1:38:30.238 --> 1:38:31.948
Thank you.

1:38:34.659 --> 1:38:37.120
Please keep these as samples.

1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:39.189
Oh.

1:38:37.954 --> 1:38:39.372
Thank you very much!

1:38:41.249 --> 1:38:44.586
Thank you!

1:38:44.961 --> 1:38:47.005
Have a good day.

1:38:51.217 --> 1:38:53.178
Did you see?

1:38:53.261 --> 1:38:55.597
They have so many Korean foods.

1:38:55.680 --> 1:38:58.224
This is such perfect timing.

1:38:58.308 --> 1:39:00.644
The owner said so himself.

1:39:04.773 --> 1:39:08.234
Mom must be in shock. She's speechless.

1:39:08.985 --> 1:39:12.072
Anne, take David to the car.

1:39:24.167 --> 1:39:25.877
Monica.

1:39:33.551 --> 1:39:35.011
Monica.

1:39:36.262 --> 1:39:38.431
What is it?

1:39:47.816 --> 1:39:51.569
You're really asking
because you don't know?

1:39:51.653 --> 1:39:53.988
At the hospital...

1:39:54.072 --> 1:39:58.410
You chose the farm over our family.

1:40:00.370 --> 1:40:02.789
It's different now.

1:40:03.707 --> 1:40:06.543
Everything worked out.

1:40:07.210 --> 1:40:10.296
We can live together when things are good,

1:40:10.380 --> 1:40:13.591
but when they're not, we fall apart?

1:40:15.093 --> 1:40:17.637
Let's just stop, okay?

1:40:17.721 --> 1:40:22.892
Now, we can make money
and live without worries.

1:40:25.937 --> 1:40:28.314
So, you're saying...

1:40:28.732 --> 1:40:33.319
We can't save each other, but money can?

1:40:37.365 --> 1:40:40.076
But Jacob...

1:40:41.119 --> 1:40:44.205
Things might be fine now.

1:40:45.206 --> 1:40:48.877
But I don't think they will stay that way.

1:40:52.589 --> 1:40:57.761
I know this won't end well
and I can't bear it.

1:40:59.220 --> 1:41:02.098
I've lost my faith in you.

1:41:08.980 --> 1:41:12.192
I can't do this anymore.

1:41:34.214 --> 1:41:36.633
Okay.

1:41:37.675 --> 1:41:40.094
It's done.

1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:12.544
You haven't left yet?

1:42:12.627 --> 1:42:14.879
We're heading out now.

1:42:14.963 --> 1:42:18.174
I'll see you next week.

1:43:16.399 --> 1:43:18.443
What's that smell?

1:43:18.776 --> 1:43:21.529
It smells like smoke.

1:43:21.821 --> 1:43:23.823
Jacob...

1:43:35.793 --> 1:43:37.253
Stay in the car!

1:43:37.337 --> 1:43:38.630
Stay in the car!

1:43:41.007 --> 1:43:42.216
Jacob!

1:44:01.778 --> 1:44:04.447
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

1:44:04.530 --> 1:44:06.783
Mom, are you okay?

1:44:06.866 --> 1:44:09.035
What happened?

1:44:09.452 --> 1:44:10.703
Mom!

1:44:12.872 --> 1:44:14.540
Jacob!

1:44:15.667 --> 1:44:17.085
Mom!

1:44:18.878 --> 1:44:19.963
Jacob!

1:44:20.338 --> 1:44:21.631
Honey!

1:44:21.714 --> 1:44:23.800
Get out! Get out of here!

1:44:38.022 --> 1:44:39.190
Mom!

1:44:39.983 --> 1:44:41.317
Dad!

1:44:41.401 --> 1:44:43.319
Dad! Dad!

1:45:03.006 --> 1:45:05.174
Grandma!

1:45:06.801 --> 1:45:09.762
You stay here, okay?

1:45:11.389 --> 1:45:12.640
Grandma!

1:45:16.352 --> 1:45:17.520
Honey!

1:45:18.312 --> 1:45:19.814
Honey!

1:45:38.041 --> 1:45:39.083
Honey!

1:46:39.979 --> 1:46:41.498
Grandma!

1:46:44.357 --> 1:46:45.942
Grandma!

1:46:46.734 --> 1:46:48.861
Grandma, where are you going?

1:46:49.028 --> 1:46:51.239
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

1:46:51.697 --> 1:46:52.907
Grandma!

1:46:56.327 --> 1:46:57.954
Grandma!

1:47:00.164 --> 1:47:01.791
Grandma!

1:47:03.042 --> 1:47:04.961
Grandma!

1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:31.030
Grandma!

1:47:34.866 --> 1:47:38.619
Grandma, this is the wrong way.

1:47:39.453 --> 1:47:40.955
Grandma.

1:47:41.455 --> 1:47:44.292
Our house is back there.

1:47:44.375 --> 1:47:46.085
Grandma!

1:47:46.169 --> 1:47:48.462
Please don't leave, Grandma.

1:47:48.546 --> 1:47:50.965
Come home with us.

1:49:53.310 --> 1:49:54.898
Yeah. Mark it.

1:49:55.796 --> 1:49:57.176
That be where it is.

1:50:50.853 --> 1:50:53.939
It's growing well on its own.

1:51:00.688 --> 1:51:01.931
David.

1:51:04.200 --> 1:51:07.870
Grandma picked a good spot.

1:51:15.711 --> 1:51:18.506
Looks tasty.

1:51:24.332 --> 1:51:25.920
Here, David.
