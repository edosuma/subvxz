00:04.129 --> 00:06.339
Whoa. Wh-Whoa.

00:28.611 --> 00:31.406
Jizzlord, please ask Carrie
what these little red dots are.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.199
Carrie, Jen wants to know--

00:33.283 --> 00:36.119
Tell Jennifer those red dots are stickers,

00:36.202 --> 00:37.996
and they denote everything
that is my property,

00:38.079 --> 00:40.248
and that if I bought it, she can't use it.

00:40.331 --> 00:41.499
Jen, Carrie says--

00:41.583 --> 00:44.544
Tell Carrie that I have bought loads
of stuff for this flat.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.463
Like…

00:50.633 --> 00:51.718
Like this.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.761
Carrie, Jen--

00:52.844 --> 00:54.929
Well, tell Jennifer she can't have
a red onion for breakfast.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.515
Jen, Carrie says you can't have
a red onion for breakfast.

00:59.017 --> 00:59.976
Oh, yeah?

01:28.004 --> 01:31.382
I'm just triple-checking
that the consultation is still free.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.967
Like, zero-pounds free?

01:34.302 --> 01:36.054
Yeah-- No, I know I called earlier. I--

01:37.555 --> 01:39.974
No, I don't know what could
possibly have changed since then, Denise.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.476
You don't need to be sarcastic.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.645
Are you going to that clinic today?

01:43.728 --> 01:46.815
Yeah. First step to getting a power.
Big day. All right, keys…

01:46.898 --> 01:49.025
-Could you give this to them?
-What is it?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.026
-Bloods.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.237
I thought they could do
that "dina" testing.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.404
There is so much of it.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.697
-Yeah, thanks.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.367
Took me ages. Uh, I kept falling asleep.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.993
What-- Do you mean DNA testing?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.161
Probably, yeah.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.372
Is that the thing where they tell you
who your mum and dad are?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.415
Usually,
you just send your spit in the post.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.252
Okay. Yeah.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.546
-Uh, could you help me with that?
-Not today.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.714
You can't rely on me
to help you all the time.

02:22.767 --> 02:26.521
<i>Oh, holy crap! Yo, it's really--</i>
<i>Oh, holy crap. Yo, it's--</i>

02:26.604 --> 02:27.605
<i>Nerd!</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:29.899
-There I go.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.236
This isn't healthy. You have to move on.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.947
-I think you feel guilty, right?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.740
-Mm-hmm.
-So make amends.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.742
Apologise to the people you've let down.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.912
Please? Do it for me.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.165
I miss my boyfriend.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.249
Really?

02:46.332 --> 02:49.127
Yeah. He's pretty fun.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.546
-And hot?
-Oh, yeah.

02:51.629 --> 02:58.136
He's got shiny, lustrous hair, dark eyes,
rippling emotional maturity.

02:58.219 --> 03:01.890
Okay. I'll do it for you.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.691
Have you brought the air fryer
into the bed?

03:11.774 --> 03:14.819
Then I don't need to go to the kitchen
to make hash browns.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.030
I'm struggling.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.439
Hey.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.900
Oh, thanks.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.030
You've got a very smooth back.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.032
Thank you.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.495
My name's Hannah, by the way.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.289
-Oh, mine's, uh--
-Gem?

04:08.373 --> 04:09.624
I can feel you tracing.

04:09.707 --> 04:11.793
Uh, Jen. But close enough.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.050
Did you just draw a penis?

04:23.888 --> 04:25.306
Have you been here before?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.391
Mm-hmm.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.893
Yeah, this is my monthly check-in.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.104
Still no powers yet.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.397
So awkward.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.400
-Wait, are you 25?
-Yeah.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.734
Me too.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.194
I haven't met anyone who's waited

04:38.278 --> 04:39.612
-so long.
-So long.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.989
You're like me.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.367
Oh, good. You finished.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.451
Here's the rest.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.870
Medical history form,
patient questionnaire.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.206
You also need to write
a short personal essay.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.961
My hand slipped.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.175
This is going to take me hours.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.261
I know a much better room to do that in.

05:06.723 --> 05:10.435
"Do you feel like your primary caregiver
hugged you to a satisfactory degree?"

05:10.518 --> 05:11.936
What kind of questions are these?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.855
Oh, yeah.
They get all up in your business.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.982
They wanna talk about your trauma
and your feelings.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.066
Gross.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.110
Isn't there, like,
some experimental surgery they can do?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.362
No. I asked.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.074
-Why did you decide to go?
-Honestly?

05:27.118 --> 05:29.746
It's that pitying look they give you
when you tell them.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.207
Yeah, they look at me
like I'm a sick hedgehog.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.417
I just can't take it.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.337
Do you know what the worst is?
"It'll happen when you least expect it."

05:37.420 --> 05:39.005
Oh, God. I hate that.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.132
-Like, I am least expecting it right now.
-Mm-hmm.

05:41.215 --> 05:42.759
-Anything? No.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.471
Do you want a proper drink?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.848
No, I shouldn't.
No, I need to return all this.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.183
Okay.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.686
I mean, a half is fine.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.105
-It's just a half.
-Just a little baby half.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.523
-It's a half.
-Just a half.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.911
Why are you and Jen fighting?

06:09.994 --> 06:10.995
Because we had an argument.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.081
-Why?
-Because Jen's a terrible person.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.624
-Why?
-Because she's selfish.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.501
-Why?
-I don't know. I'm not a therapist.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.128
-Why?
-I get too emotionally invested,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.214
and I didn't do the right A levels.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.054
Jen yelled at me this morning,
and she wouldn't help me with my bloods.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.597
We don't need Jen.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.016
I think I do. She buys my food.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.772
Our erotic jigsaw collection.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.024
Me and Jen found these a few years ago,

06:40.108 --> 06:41.734
and we've been working our way
through them.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.070
We made a whole night of it. Face masks.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.488
Margaritas.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.824
I have a very precise system
for jigsawing,

06:47.907 --> 06:50.701
but Jen would just dive right in,
and it would be chaos.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.662
It would take us all night.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.502
Would be a shame
if we couldn't finish them together.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.438
Oh.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.817
You going somewhere?

07:22.900 --> 07:23.985
Oh, no.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.364
Well, yeah, Florida.

07:28.448 --> 07:33.536
I've been a little afraid of the outside
since the--

07:34.245 --> 07:35.496
since the bashing.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.792
So, um, thought that
I'd just take the plunge, literally.

07:39.876 --> 07:43.546
I'm gonna go swim with the dolphins.
Heard it's very therapeutic.

07:44.213 --> 07:47.592
And they're fish, so I can summon them.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.260
Dolphins are mammals, mate.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.643
I wanted to, uh, say sorry.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.820
This means a lot.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.377
Well…

08:23.461 --> 08:25.254
Are those for the rest of the boys?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.006
Yeah. Enjoy Florida.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.468
Can I-- Can I come see them with you?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.470
I don't really wanna go anymore.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.307
This is more of a solo effort.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.477
Not a lad's farewell tour kind of thing.

08:39.560 --> 08:44.232
If it were a lad's farewell tour kind
of thing, we could get T-shirts made up.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.076
But it's just like-- like,
everyone thinks they're better than you.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.537
But it's just random.
Like, it's all random.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.413
And boom! You can fly.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.624
Boom! You can heal people.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.584
Boom! You can fucking talk to bread.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.503
But you--
you didn't do anything to earn that.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.213
You don't deserve to know
what bread's feeling.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.674
Exactly, exactly.
Like, it's just so unfair.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.425
I feel like all the odds
are stacked against us.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.760
You know what I mean?

09:12.843 --> 09:15.429
-Again. Do the first one.
-I like that one.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.764
-Come on.
-Yeah.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.434
Wait, wait, wait. This is the best one.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.019
-Yeah.
-Yeah, do it.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.357
Yes, this one. Just keep it.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.942
Oh, fuck off.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.695
Right? I can do that. It's called a wig.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.030
I dread to think what her pubes look like.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.911
Do you ever feel it's like everyone
is in this big secret club,

09:38.995 --> 09:41.330
-and you're the only one not invited?
-Totally.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.082
We should just start a club,
just you and me.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.834
Yeah, and then they'll be the ones
that's left out.

09:44.917 --> 09:45.918
Yeah.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.920
You are so pretty, by the way.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.798
You're so pretty.

09:50.881 --> 09:51.966
And I think-- I think--

09:52.049 --> 09:54.135
No, it is definitely not too soon
to say this.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.054
I think you are the Princess Diana
of our generation.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.139
Seriously.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.810
I have been waiting my whole life
for someone to say that to me.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.444
-Oh?
-Someone's had too much.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.782
I dare you to cut off her ponytail.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.744
-I can't do that.
-Yes, you can.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.537
She can fix it in a second.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.629
It's something about the car for me.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.507
Really? I'd love to see it.
I mean, what car do you drive?

10:34.342 --> 10:35.718
What the hell?

10:38.179 --> 10:39.472
Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.002
A cheese single at midnight?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.213
-Jesus!
-Come on. You're not recently divorced.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.011
Sorry, sorry.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.764
It's just me. I thought I'd surprise you.

11:21.847 --> 11:26.143
Don't spring him on me like some sort
of grief Jack-in-the-box. Fucking hell.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.522
I thought you'd wanna talk about
how your consultation went.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.690
I didn't finish it.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.149
Jen. Why not?

11:32.233 --> 11:34.318
Me and Hannah went to the pub.
We lost track of time.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.070
Plus, I'll go back, so…

11:36.153 --> 11:37.238
Who's Hannah?

11:37.321 --> 11:38.989
Hannah is my new friend.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.784
Actually, she's my best friend,
and she's really cool,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.327
and she doesn't act like she's my mum.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.870
Well, I've got a new best friend too.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.039
Carrie, the people at Lush are paid
to talk to you like that.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.166
-We've been through this.
-Jizzlord.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.711
He's my cat-- Man. He's my man.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.505
No, no. No, he's not my man,
but you know what I mean.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.299
I thought you were too busy
with your new cool friend.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.760
I am. Couldn't care less what you two do.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.555
We're going to do
an erotic jigsaw tomorrow night.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.724
-You're doing an EJ?
-Whole hog.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.268
-You can't. They're mine. I bought them.
-No, you didn't.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.270
Yeah, I did. I remember
because the bank called me to ask

12:09.353 --> 12:12.773
if I was sure I wanted to spend £200
on erotic jigsaws, and I said, yeah.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.735
And then they lowered my overdraft limit.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.653
-Well, we've always shared them.
-Not anymore.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.950
All right, well,
now that we've settled that,

12:23.033 --> 12:25.411
I think I'm ready to speak to my dad.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.788
I think my heart has
just about stopped palpitating.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.916
No.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.961
What do you mean, "no"? You just offered.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.091
I rescind it.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.511
You can't rescind my dead dad.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.097
I rescind it.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.479
If you don't need me, then I guess
you don't need my power either.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.748
I don't know if I can do this.
Do you think he'll be mad?

13:10.831 --> 13:13.250
No, Ade's lovely. He'll understand.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.503
Twenty-six hours.

13:17.421 --> 13:21.801
I was stuck in that wall for 26 hours.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.013
Someone thought I was a Banksy.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.557
They sent a local news crew out.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.018
-Someone made an NFT of it.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.812
-Sorry, sorry.

13:32.895 --> 13:38.567
An insurance broker in the Netherlands
owns the copyright on my arse.

13:40.444 --> 13:42.321
-Do you know how that feels?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.323
Use your words.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.872
"Firstly, I would like to extend
my most sincere apologies

13:51.956 --> 13:55.709
for the unfortunate events that transpired
on the night of the 12th."

13:59.088 --> 14:01.632
I just wanted to do something big,
you know?

14:01.715 --> 14:03.884
Just feel kind of useless
most of the time.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.387
Like no one really needs me.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.389
I'm not a leader.

14:09.723 --> 14:10.724
Not a hero.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.685
I'm a failure.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.438
I'll send you your Toblerones in the post
in case you want them later.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.523
Kash.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.654
You just did exactly what a leader does.
You took responsibility.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.364
That's not easy to do.

14:25.865 --> 14:30.077
Yeah. Uh, I don't think
you're incompetent, necessarily.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.829
Just think we had bad luck.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.291
Yeah. I bet if we had one more crack
at it, we'd blow everyone away.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.459
-How's that pressure?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.919
What, get back together?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.676
I'd come back older and wiser.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.972
Rising from the ashes like a phoenix.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.726
I'm not depressed.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.687
I'm in the middle of a redemption arc.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.647
Yeah, it all makes sense now.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.733
This isn't a lad's farewell tour.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.943
This is an assembling.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.113
We're in the middle of an assembling!

15:08.240 --> 15:10.159
Guys, guys, guys, guys, please.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.286
I'm still working.

15:25.799 --> 15:30.137
Hey, so I know you're upset
about the erotic jigsaw,

15:30.220 --> 15:31.388
so I made you a new one.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.853
But this is just a drawing
of a dog in a hat.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.858
Yeah, I don't know what "erotic" means
or what a jigsaw is.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.908
Hey, sorry I'm late.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.534
Yeah, the pub's not open yet.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.287
-Fuck.
-Why did you wanna meet here?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.790
I left all my clinic forms behind me
last night.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.126
And I want to return this
in case anyone was looking for it.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.045
Maybe they could glue it back on.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.507
I was actually thinking about
what you said last night.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.759
It is so fucked, isn't it?

16:08.842 --> 16:11.303
-Oh, yeah. Society!
-Yeah.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.014
So I quit.
I'm not going back to the clinic.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.141
-Ever?
-Ever.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.477
Did you have fun last night?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.561
Yeah.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.063
Did you need a power to do that?

16:21.772 --> 16:22.773
No.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.233
Right, so let's just have fun.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.902
Yeah. Fuck it.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.988
Why am I doing homework on the weekend?
It can wait.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.323
Right. The world owes us, Jen.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.866
We can do whatever we want.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.619
Oh, I feel so free.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.371
Maybe I should take my bra off.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.588
I hate this so much.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.382
He's gonna be such little a dick about it.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.634
Maybe we should do Randall first?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.845
It's a small sacrifice to make.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.179
Think about the group.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.315
Firstly, I would like to apologise for my…

17:06.817 --> 17:08.527
Why are you in your suit?

17:09.945 --> 17:11.030
No reason.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.782
I accept your apology. Goodbye.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.789
Oh, what are you pussies doing here?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.292
Are you joining? Sick.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.210
Joining what?

17:42.019 --> 17:43.729
You little slut.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.689
Well, you can't be mad at me
for moving on.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.984
We were a band of brothers.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.945
Oh, you were a band of losers.
It was never gonna work.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.198
If anything,
you should be grateful to Kash

17:54.281 --> 17:55.866
for putting you out of your misery.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.452
No. Don't talk about them like that.

17:58.535 --> 18:01.121
Or what? What are they gonna do?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.040
Throw a haddock at me?

18:04.583 --> 18:06.210
Get stuck in a wall at me?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.839
Let's go. Right now. You and me.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.678
Okay.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.641
No, seriously, come on. Hit me.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.189
Ooh, no, no, no.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.399
No, really try this time.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.949
-You see the pattern here, right?
-Wait. What am I doing?

18:37.616 --> 18:38.700
No, Kash, don't you--

18:49.795 --> 18:51.755
-Oh, God. Kash, did you--
-Yo, yo!

18:51.839 --> 18:54.258
Trust me. He will have deserved it.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.717
What are you pussies doing here?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.469
Randall, come with us.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.179
The boys are back in town.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.438
-Oh, my God.
-Ow!

19:08.522 --> 19:09.940
Too easy.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.068
Ten points if you get a head shot.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.911
Oi, what'd you do that for?

19:24.037 --> 19:25.998
Yes, mate.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.833
-Hey! Little shit!
-That was good.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.961
Yeah, I was thinking, maybe we should try
and find more people who are like us.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.838
What, like, make the club a little bigger?

19:32.921 --> 19:35.340
Yeah. I know, we could have a group chat.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.342
Have a place where we all hang out.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.969
Yes. Our own island.

19:39.052 --> 19:41.388
Yeah, or maybe, like, a bar.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.223
Except we don't let
anyone with powers in, yeah.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.435
Yes, and we can have, like,
a secret handshake and a password.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.228
Oh, and we could get matching tattoos.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.980
Oh, my God. Should we do that now?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.607
Jen?

19:52.816 --> 19:54.985
What are you doing on a roof?

19:55.068 --> 19:56.820
Uh, nothing, nothing.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.363
Just being crazy.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.491
Ah, what's she gonna do next?
She's so spontaneous. Ah!

20:02.492 --> 20:03.785
Right.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.288
Uh, where you going?

20:06.955 --> 20:09.708
Out. Bossa nova night at Moth Bar.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.543
Oh.

20:12.836 --> 20:14.421
-Can I join?

20:15.547 --> 20:18.133
You are so funny, Jen. I love it.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.975
-What was that?
-Oh, yeah.

20:27.059 --> 20:31.480
Um, might not seem like it, but that's
actually better than it usually goes.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.358
Look, you're not rejecting people with
powers if you're drooling over fly boys.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.734
I am not drooling.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.153
And I hate powers just as much as you do.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.988
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.074
-I'll prove it.
-How?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.122
Do you have a latex allergy?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.464
This is a bad idea!

20:57.547 --> 20:59.883
We just got here!
Just give it a minute!

21:00.759 --> 21:02.135
What?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.720
I can't hear you!

21:04.513 --> 21:05.681
Oh, it's just stopped.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.266
Well, that's convenient.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.607
I'm gonna fuck it up.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.492
Do it. Do it!

21:31.790 --> 21:32.791
Oh, my God!

21:42.801 --> 21:44.011
Fuck you, Denise!

21:47.264 --> 21:50.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.728
-I'm pissing on the desk.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.730
-Why?
-I don't know.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.443
Do you see any tissues anywhere?

22:02.195 --> 22:03.196
Jen?

22:05.324 --> 22:06.325
Hannah?

22:07.784 --> 22:08.994
Oh, Jen.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.751
-What's going on?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.045
I don't know.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.798
Hannah! What the fuck?

22:25.802 --> 22:27.387
I think I can teleport.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.058
This is so fucking cool!

22:31.141 --> 22:32.601
Mmm. Right. Really cool.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.860
I guess that's the end of our club.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.655
Just because I've got powers now
doesn't mean that anything's gonna change.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.950
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.290
Hey.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.542
Oh, shit.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.504
What do you think you're doing here? Hey?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.552
Oi! Get back here, you!

23:17.187 --> 23:18.855
Guess who's a guilt-free man.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.612
I'm so proud of you!

23:25.695 --> 23:29.825
Now you can move on to other things.
Better things. Adult things.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.536
We could go on a couple's mini-break.
Oh, that would be fun, wouldn't it?

23:32.619 --> 23:34.329
I'm not gonna have time
to do something like that.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.165
The vigilante group's officially rebooted.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.625
-What?
-Yeah.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.128
We're streamlined.
We're hungry. We're hyped.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.758
Thanks for pushing me. None of this
would've happened if it wasn't for you.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.483
<i>Do it!</i>

24:04.317 --> 24:05.944
-<i>Oh, my days!</i>
-<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

24:06.027 --> 24:08.697
-<i>What the fuck?</i>
-<i>I can do a better one.</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:10.198
-<i>I'm gonna do a better one.</i>
-<i>Do it.</i>

24:10.282 --> 24:11.283
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

24:11.366 --> 24:13.285
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

24:13.368 --> 24:15.579
<i>Someone got her power yesterday.</i>

24:15.662 --> 24:17.038
<i>What was it? A couple days ago?</i>

24:22.502 --> 24:23.795
Made you a cup of tea.

24:31.845 --> 24:35.182
I saw it on television. It makes
everything better for some reason.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.732
Carrie really wants to finish
those jigsaws with you.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.984
She seems quite sad.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.737
It's too late. She hates me.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.073
So you're gonna shun her
and never talk to her again? Okay.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.451
No, what? No. I'm not gonna do that.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.911
So, you gonna be friends again?

24:56.786 --> 25:01.124
Probably, but it's--
it's not that simple.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.335
Do you wanna be her friend?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.253
Yeah.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.047
She wants to be your friend?

25:07.130 --> 25:08.173
I hope so.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.971
I must have the word "simple" wrong.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.312
It tastes funny.

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
Oh, yeah. Um…

25:23.980 --> 25:27.234
Tea didn't really seem like enough,
so I put a lot of painkillers in it.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.655
All right. I'm just gonna put that there.

26:50.317 --> 26:56.156
Does this look like a man's nipple
or a woman's nipple to you?

26:57.866 --> 26:59.200
Mmm.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.910
Man's. It's got a hair on it.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.537
No guarantee.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.372
Man's. Trust me.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.255
Armpit or bum cleft?

27:12.339 --> 27:15.884
Oh, that's a hard one. I wanna say armpit.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.553
-Although that does look very "clefty."

27:24.809 --> 27:26.019
This one, over there.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.525
How am I supposed to know
what blood type I am?

27:33.026 --> 27:34.069
AB positive.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.115
And you're O negative?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.201
Not even close.

27:42.702 --> 27:44.037
But I appreciate the effort.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.914
Thank you.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.541
It's going to be a two-way street
from now on.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.043
Burden me with your problems.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.463
-My problem?
-Mm-hmm.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.798
Oh.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.425
Oh, this is weird doing it this way round,
isn't it?

27:57.509 --> 27:58.927
-Mmm.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.637
Can't really think of anything.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.514
Mmm.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.558
Except maybe one tiny little thing.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.560
Kash is back with his old vigilante group,

28:07.644 --> 28:10.355
and I hate it, and I think
it's gonna ruin our relationship.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.318
But apart from that, fine.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.621
Is it just me,
or does it smell a bit like piss in here?

28:29.082 --> 28:31.084
I don't smell anything.
