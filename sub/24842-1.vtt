Fucken,

01:32.467 --> 01:33.503
Put her down.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.685
Hey!

01:59.870 --> 02:01.156
Don't you fuckin' move!

06:39.316 --> 06:40.352
Pop the boot?

06:43.278 --> 06:44.814
And good morning to you too.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.064
Glad to see you, how was work perhaps?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.582
Morning!

07:21.024 --> 07:22.060
Happy Anniversary

07:22.317 --> 07:23.398
Dean?

07:23.485 --> 07:24.521
Yes?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.064
Thank you.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.270
See, I didn't forget.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.612
And...

07:31.242 --> 07:32.483
I made you breakfast.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.826
What the hell is this?

07:34.579 --> 07:35.615
Nice lunchbox.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.705
Just open it, it's the only one we had.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.540
Egg and bacon?

07:40.669 --> 07:41.705
Yes.
- Cool.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.753
Mmm, it's good.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.122
It's good.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.957
You hate cooking.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.510
Well, someone's gotta look after ya.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.421
Mmm, it's good.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.469
Hang on,

07:57.143 --> 07:58.179
wait.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.737
Oh god!

08:24.754 --> 08:26.962
And was all that just for me?

08:28.675 --> 08:29.756
Pity,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.835
tradie look was sexy.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.392
Who's texting you?

08:44.691 --> 08:45.807
Mum,

08:46.234 --> 08:48.021
good luck on your weekend away.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.027
Probably glad we're not taking
advantage of your empty house.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.281
She doesn't think we're sixteen.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.231
So, guess what Kim told me,

10:17.367 --> 10:18.448
you know Kim.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.367
Yeah, she's the slutty one?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.454
Dean, stop saying that, she's lovely.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.289
What about her?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.705
Well, she's pregnant.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.669
Oh great, now I feel bad.

10:30.755 --> 10:31.791
Yeah, you should.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.794
Does she know who the father is?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.508
Dean!

10:37.053 --> 10:38.544
Just joking, relax.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.004
Yeah, you better be.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.682
So why are you telling me
she's pregnant?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.639
Just thought you might wanna know.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.600
I actually don't care.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.265
Hang on a second,

10:51.276 --> 10:52.608
you're not pregnant are ya?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.192
No, I'm not!

10:54.195 --> 10:55.276
Sure?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.897
Stop looking like you think
I could be.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.075
Thank god for that aye?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.414
Does that mean
you don't want kids one day?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.700
Don't really think about it.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.704
Well you must have some sort of idea?

11:14.424 --> 11:15.540
Yes, no?

11:15.550 --> 11:16.666
Maybe, I dunno.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.130
You?

11:19.804 --> 11:20.885
Yeah, of course.

11:21.556 --> 11:22.637
What?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.340
Well not now!

11:24.350 --> 11:25.431
Okay!

11:26.436 --> 11:28.553
You had me worried there for a second.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.850
So,

11:33.860 --> 11:37.228
have you given much thought
to when Feb comes round?

11:37.655 --> 11:38.771
No.

11:38.781 --> 11:39.817
Why?

11:40.283 --> 11:41.319
My course.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.075
Claire, you said you weren't gonna go.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.281
Well I wasn't.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.327
But?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.826
Dean, you know how good the course is,

11:51.920 --> 11:54.287
and they only take like
twelve people a year.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.960
Yeah, and the university's all the
way up in Queensland honey.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.548
Yeah, and I got in.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.417
I can't just turn them down.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.549
And I know you don't want me to go,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.718
but this is such a huge
opportunity for me,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.765
there's no waiting list,
no second chances,

12:07.769 --> 12:09.180
it's now or never.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.984
What, so you want me to
stay here my whole life?

12:16.986 --> 12:18.477
Aren't we happy here?

12:18.488 --> 12:20.024
That's not what I meant.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.068
Just can't we be
happy there?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.577
Dean?

12:27.830 --> 12:28.866
What?

12:30.667 --> 12:32.784
Well don't you have anything
else to say about it?

12:32.794 --> 12:35.707
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
But I don't have to like it.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.871
You could at least be happy for me.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.043
I am happy.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.924
But you know, I don't even want

12:40.927 --> 12:42.168
to talk about this right now.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.464
I don't wanna think about it

12:43.471 --> 12:45.053
or talk about it, ok?

13:05.827 --> 13:07.068
This'll do us.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.448
I'll go.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.011
I can't even get my GPS up.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.105
That's ok, I don't need directions.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.436
So you know where we're going?

14:20.943 --> 14:22.184
More or less, yeah.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.382
You are so lost.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.305
There's no way anyone could
get lost in this town it's tiny.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.640
Look at it.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.718
Yet you've managed

14:59.524 --> 15:00.685
Congratulations.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.950
Service station, perfect.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.285
So you can ask for directions?

15:14.288 --> 15:16.450
I don't need directions.
I need to fill up.

15:17.375 --> 15:18.536
Really Dean?

15:18.543 --> 15:19.624
Yep,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.084
but you can ask if you want.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.880
Looks like they're open too.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.428
Success.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.266
What, that you're filling up
or that you know where we are?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.025
Eh, bit of both.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.144
Where are you goin?

15:47.613 --> 15:48.649
Bathroom

15:50.450 --> 15:51.941
Number one or number two?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.150
Aw Dean!

16:38.498 --> 16:39.659
Ah, got a light?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.282
No, sorry.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.881
I don't smoke, so I don't need one.
Sorry.

16:56.891 --> 16:57.972
Ya car's got one.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.217
On your console.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.646
I'm sorry, doesn't yours too?

17:04.648 --> 17:05.765
Mine's not workin'.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.392
Well I can't fix it for you.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.647
You don't have to be a smartass alright,

17:10.820 --> 17:12.186
I just
want a smoke.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.319
Look, I don't have
a lighter for you, so just

17:15.326 --> 17:17.864
Stop being a little bitch
and give me a fuckin light

17:17.869 --> 17:18.906
Get lost!

17:18.913 --> 17:21.621
Don't make me smash
through this fuckin' window.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.040
Oi!

17:24.042 --> 17:25.079
You right?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.664
Yeah mate,

17:27.672 --> 17:28.913
just need a light here,

17:29.006 --> 17:30.668
but your missus
won't help us out.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.544
Yeah well she doesn't smoke.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.089
Good man.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.143
Yeah grab it.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.112
Cheers mate.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.711
What do you reckon?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.433
Heh, you sure do attract the creeps.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.471
Dean it's not funny.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.393
Claire he's gone now,
don't worry about it.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.266
Don't worry about it?!

18:32.486 --> 18:33.727
Well you're ok yeah?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.563
Yeah, but

18:36.073 --> 18:39.157
he was seriously like
a disgusting feral...

18:40.202 --> 18:41.283
gross.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.081
And you didn't have
to be so nice to him.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.790
Claire with guys like
that you just give

18:47.793 --> 18:49.455
them what they want
and then fuck off.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.206
Well what did you want me to do?

18:55.384 --> 18:56.591
I dunno,

18:57.553 --> 18:58.634
bash him?

18:58.888 --> 18:59.924
Bash him?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.011
Ok,

19:01.140 --> 19:02.676
next time I promise.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.520
Ah Dean,

19:10.191 --> 19:12.433
we've passed that pub like three times.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.688
Ok fine, I'm lost.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.436
Let's just ask someone for
directions.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.565
Actually, no I don't think we are.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.283
It's just down there.

19:23.871 --> 19:24.907
I knew that.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.742
Yeah sure you did.

19:50.648 --> 19:51.684
Yeah!

19:53.609 --> 19:54.645
Not bad.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.908
Come to bed.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.706
No, no!

20:10.501 --> 20:11.912
Let's sleep.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.661
No, no.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.873
You're just trying to make me comfy

20:18.884 --> 20:20.750
so we don't have
to leave the hotel room.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.009
Is it working?

20:23.848 --> 20:25.009
Maybe.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.763
I really did want to go out
and have a look around town though.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.063
I've got a better idea.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.111
You are so predictable.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.224
You didn't!

21:14.231 --> 21:15.472
I did.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.100
And they didn't know what
a bloody latte was.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.351
You better enjoy that.

21:20.905 --> 21:21.941
Thank you.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.231
This looks cosy.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.736
And don't you get too comfy,
we're going hiking today.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.578
Bull shit, we're going back to bed.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.742
Dean.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.496
Fine, let's go hiking.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.589
Well you coming?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.341
I've gotta finish this first.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.835
You can eat it in the car.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.552
Gimme that back! Dean.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.375
Nah better pull over,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.749
we're in the middle of
nowhere.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.836
Dean.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.581
I could probably rebuild that thing.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.049
Aw shit.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.259
What?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.215
It's that fuckwit from the servo.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.262
Just keep driving.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.928
Claire it's gonna be hours
before anyone come here,

22:35.938 --> 22:37.520
he's gonna be stuck out here.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.604
Dean please, he scares me.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.564
Yeah, he's pretty scary.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.729
He threatened me ok,

22:41.735 --> 22:42.816
just go.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.110
Just go!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.193
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

22:51.203 --> 22:52.284
Well,

22:52.288 --> 22:54.951
I didn't think we'd be
bumping into him again.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.866
What did he say?

22:58.419 --> 23:00.502
It doesn't matter now,
I don't wanna talk about it.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.259
Are you mad at me?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.962
No I'm not mad,

23:10.973 --> 23:13.966
I just, Claire I don't like being
left in the dark. Ok?

25:18.934 --> 25:22.098
I think we should go back
to the hotel room now.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.063
Yes.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.435
Loser.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.871
I'm driving.

25:56.805 --> 25:57.841
Can you smell that?

26:04.438 --> 26:05.724
Aw shit.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.145
Fuck.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.734
Dean.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.488
Sorry I'm gonna have to pull over.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.903
I thought you got this thing fixed?

26:18.452 --> 26:19.613
I did.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.241
Come on!

27:19.304 --> 27:21.011
What seems to be the problem mate?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.592
Ah all good, just over heated buddy

27:27.521 --> 27:28.762
You need some water?

27:31.316 --> 27:34.730
Ah nah, I'm right. Just gonna give her
some coolant and I'll be on my way.

27:34.736 --> 27:35.772
Cheers.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.613
Piece of shit car, this must
happen all the time right?

27:38.615 --> 27:39.947
That's not really helping mate.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.194
Mate?

27:42.035 --> 27:43.571
So we're mates now.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.075
Look, like I said, I'm alright, ok?

27:46.081 --> 27:48.698
No we couldn't just leave you
here on the side of the road.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.621
We're good blokes, aren't we Heath?

27:50.627 --> 27:53.415
Yeah wouldn't leave you
broken down, that's for sure.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.458
Mate, whatever.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.669
You and me,

27:58.510 --> 27:59.751
we're not mates.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.840
I'll be hers though.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.772

38:42.362 --> 38:43.478
Can you move at all?

38:43.488 --> 38:44.524

38:47.742 --> 38:50.405

things we're gonna do

38:53.540 --> 38:54.906
when we get out of here.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.583
Try and see if you can
slip out of your ropes.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.701
I can't!

38:58.711 --> 39:00.748
If you get loose we can make
a break for the cover

39:00.755 --> 39:02.121
and get the fuck out of this tray.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.338

box is in here with us, look.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.639
We have to open that tool box,
down there.

39:20.650 --> 39:23.518
We'll find something sharp
to cut our ropes.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.190
It's next to your feet, I can't
get to it. I need you to try.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.357
I can't...

39:26.364 --> 39:27.650
Can you do that for me? Please?

39:28.283 --> 39:30.320

39:30.326 --> 39:32.659

39:33.371 --> 39:35.158
See if you can kick
it over first,

39:35.164 --> 39:37.326
try and kick it over first
and spill the tools.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.370
Kick it over.

Someone will find us.

42:06.399 --> 42:07.765
No one knows you're here.

Let us go! Let us go.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.331

all this trouble to get you?

42:28.546 --> 42:29.662
Please!

42:29.756 --> 42:31.588
We didn't do anything to you!

42:32.425 --> 42:34.542
Well that's part
of the problem, isn't it?

42:34.552 --> 42:37.590
Couldn't even pull over
