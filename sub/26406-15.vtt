WEBVTT

00:04.987 --> 00:06.354
First order of business...

00:06.356 --> 00:08.305
another foot was found
in the parking lot.

00:08.306 --> 00:11.057
Wow. It's so weird
seeing you as the manager.

00:11.059 --> 00:13.243
It's like that one time my math teacher

00:13.245 --> 00:14.928
became my stepdad for a little bit.

00:14.930 --> 00:16.296
Like, what?

00:16.537 --> 00:18.303
It's a big change. Must be weird.

00:18.593 --> 00:21.280
Anyway, this foot had
the number eight written on it,

00:21.340 --> 00:23.106
which is concerning
because we've only found

00:23.108 --> 00:24.907
two other feet, so keep your eyes open.

00:24.908 --> 00:26.710
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

00:26.712 --> 00:28.378
The baby was throwing up all night,

00:28.380 --> 00:30.714
t the doctor said it's
probably 'cause I just gave her

00:30.716 --> 00:33.417
part of my buffalo chicken
wrap, you know?

00:33.419 --> 00:35.919
Okay, uh, let's get down to business.

00:35.921 --> 00:37.487
- Uh, Glenn?
- Mm-hmm.

00:37.489 --> 00:39.623
Yeah. You're not manager anymore.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.993
Oh. Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.

00:42.995 --> 00:45.429
After 30 years,
it's just... it's muscle memory.

00:45.431 --> 00:46.663
Of course. Yeah.

00:46.665 --> 00:48.732
Okay, I'm gonna go take my seat and...

00:48.734 --> 00:50.600
Oh, you can read my announcements.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.803
Oh, no, I wrote up my own
announcements... I'm good.

00:52.805 --> 00:54.771
There's some real goodies in here.

00:54.773 --> 00:56.373
They're gonna eat it up. Trust me.

00:56.381 --> 00:57.396
Go ahead. Read.

01:00.114 --> 01:04.715
"So I bet you're wondering why there
are so many cops in the parking lot."

01:04.717 --> 01:08.018
"Let's just say there's
a mystery afoot."

01:15.511 --> 01:16.760
- Hey boss.
- Hey.

01:17.331 --> 01:20.465
Little office-warming gift.
Got it in the Garden Center.

01:20.467 --> 01:21.076
I'm not sure what it is.

01:21.077 --> 01:23.118
The tag just said, "Medium Plant."

01:23.120 --> 01:24.969
It's a large plant that didn't grow.

01:24.970 --> 01:27.089
How cool is this?

01:27.091 --> 01:28.286
It's very cool.

01:28.287 --> 01:30.943
That's it?
You have your own office now.

01:30.945 --> 01:32.394
You've made it.
How are you not ecstatic?

01:32.396 --> 01:34.692
I'm happy. What do you want me to do?

01:34.693 --> 01:35.140
I don't know.

01:35.141 --> 01:37.682
Spin around in your chair,
feel the power.

01:40.638 --> 01:41.853
Is this good for you?

01:41.855 --> 01:43.655
Feels pretty powerful to me.

01:43.657 --> 01:45.474
I feel like you're mocking me.

01:45.476 --> 01:47.559
No. I would never.

01:47.561 --> 01:49.861
If someone held a gun
to your head and asked you,

01:49.863 --> 01:51.229
"Who would be the best person

01:51.231 --> 01:53.365
to replace Amy as floor supervisor,"

01:53.367 --> 01:54.306
who would you say?

01:54.307 --> 01:56.134
Probably the guy with the gun.

01:56.136 --> 01:57.970
Okay. No, he doesn't want the job.

01:57.972 --> 01:59.905
Oh, well, then what's up with the gun?

01:59.907 --> 02:01.540
Forget the gun. Who would you pick?

02:01.542 --> 02:03.692
Okay, if I had to pick someone here,

02:03.694 --> 02:04.912
it would probably be...

02:06.436 --> 02:08.213
Actually, you would be good for it.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.032
I know. That's what everyone is saying.

02:10.033 --> 02:12.718
But I don't think
Amy sees me as a leader.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.953
In her eyes, I'd always be
the wide-eyed ingenue...

02:14.955 --> 02:17.155
new to the city, naive but hopeful,

02:17.157 --> 02:18.757
someone who can eat whatever he wants

02:18.759 --> 02:19.891
and never put on any weight.

02:19.892 --> 02:21.460
Maybe you just need to step up

02:21.462 --> 02:22.761
and start acting like a leader.

02:22.763 --> 02:24.229
Fake it 'till you make it.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.797
What does that even mean?

02:25.799 --> 02:28.033
Like, I should just start
telling people what to do?

02:28.035 --> 02:29.201
It worked for Bo.

02:29.203 --> 02:30.936
One day he walked into a drugstore

02:30.938 --> 02:34.072
wearing a white coat,
and now he's a pharmacist tech.

02:34.074 --> 02:35.407
Really?

02:35.409 --> 02:37.242
We don't have to buy
street drugs anymore.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.527
But why would Paul Walker's
ghost single you out?

02:40.834 --> 02:42.714
I'm just saying...
sometimes the car speeds up

02:42.716 --> 02:44.483
even when I'm not pressing on the gas.

02:44.485 --> 02:46.251
Good morning, fellow floor workers?

02:46.253 --> 02:48.987
Floor worker Glenn Sturgis,
at your service.

02:48.989 --> 02:50.222
What's with the shirt?

02:50.224 --> 02:51.556
Oh, this is a little bit of history...

02:51.558 --> 02:54.693
the original Cloud 9 uniform.

02:54.695 --> 02:58.189
One size fits all, and it still fits.

02:58.474 --> 02:59.968
Oh, well, looks like
you're ready for work.

03:00.021 --> 03:01.983
You got your shirt, you got
your giant orthopedic shoes.

03:01.985 --> 03:05.136
And customized insoles
from The Walking Company.

03:05.137 --> 03:07.305
And also, Jerusha and I are
splitting a pair of clogs,

03:07.307 --> 03:09.053
'cause we're the same size...
women's 15.

03:09.054 --> 03:11.921
Yeah. Your wife has beautiful feet.

03:12.512 --> 03:15.091
Thank you.
Anyway, so where do we begin?

03:15.558 --> 03:17.205
Someone diarrhea'd in the toy aisle.

03:17.206 --> 03:19.594
Oh, dibs! If... if you don't mind.

03:19.596 --> 03:21.012
- That's all you, dude.
- You got it.

03:21.014 --> 03:21.654
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

03:21.655 --> 03:23.012
Off to mop the slop.

03:23.693 --> 03:26.127
Ah, man, he made it sound fun.

03:26.603 --> 03:28.469
- No, he didn't.
- Yeah, he did.

03:28.471 --> 03:30.779
- Your dad is getting good.
- Right?

03:30.780 --> 03:32.618
He's in this whole Brat Pack phase.

03:32.619 --> 03:35.009
16-year-old Amy is very excited.

03:35.011 --> 03:37.245
Oh, were you in the middle of sex?

03:37.247 --> 03:38.889
I wasn't. Were you?

03:38.890 --> 03:40.480
- No.
- Weird.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.047
It really smells like sex in here.

03:42.049 --> 03:43.766
Probably smelling myself.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.918
Anyway, I wanted to talk
about our security system.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.903
- Uh, what's wrong with it?
- It's crap.

03:47.905 --> 03:49.889
Glenn never let me upgrade it
because of the cost,

03:49.891 --> 03:52.792
which is why I am so excited
that you're in charge.

03:52.794 --> 03:54.610
Uh, well, what does it cost?

03:54.612 --> 03:56.762
Honestly, not that much.
It's just, like, a...

03:56.764 --> 03:59.732
just a tiny bit north of $600,000.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.567
$800,000, to be precise.

04:01.830 --> 04:05.632
Oh, yeah, well,
that sounds like a bargain.

04:05.634 --> 04:08.068
Um, Jonah, what do you think?

04:09.705 --> 04:12.105
Um, we...

04:12.107 --> 04:15.675
Well, um,
technology is always changing,

04:15.677 --> 04:17.142
so I'd probably wait a minute

04:17.144 --> 04:18.845
before investing in something new.

04:18.846 --> 04:21.664
Hmm. That...
that's a really good point.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.191
Maybe we should revisit this.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.187
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

04:27.189 --> 04:29.322
Thank you, Jonah, for your input.

04:29.324 --> 04:32.225
So glad you were here
to chime in with your...

04:32.227 --> 04:33.607
valuable perspective.

04:36.565 --> 04:38.583
I feel like she didn't mean that.

04:43.505 --> 04:46.172
Now, that is a nice-looking display.

04:46.174 --> 04:47.774
Thanks. I sorted them

04:47.776 --> 04:50.477
by order of smells
I encountered growing up.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.279
Well, um, since you're done here,

04:53.281 --> 04:54.581
why don't you go, um,

04:54.583 --> 04:56.583
straighten out the linen section?

04:57.062 --> 04:58.878
Oh, um...

04:59.849 --> 05:01.387
did someone say I should?

05:02.940 --> 05:03.623
I mean...

05:05.122 --> 05:06.204
who...

05:07.217 --> 05:08.978
Who...

05:09.454 --> 05:10.146
What?

05:12.093 --> 05:14.033
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

05:20.269 --> 05:22.936
How is Fig Newton the first
thing you ever smelled?

05:22.938 --> 05:24.505
And I just want to confirm,

05:24.507 --> 05:26.140
are you gonna want an assistant?

05:26.142 --> 05:27.808
Uh, oh, do I get an assistant?

05:27.810 --> 05:28.876
Glenn never had one.

05:28.878 --> 05:30.544
Yeah, he always thought

05:30.546 --> 05:32.579
it would come out
of his salary, but it doesn't.

05:32.581 --> 05:34.381
Speaking of, um, I...

05:34.383 --> 05:37.418
I don't even really know
what my salary is.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.986
Would you...
would you happen to have it?

05:38.988 --> 05:42.032
Oh, it's, um, $109,000.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.997
Hello? Are you still there?

05:50.403 --> 05:52.414
Uh, yes. Uh...

05:52.415 --> 05:55.719
Yeah. Uh, uh-huh. Sorry, sorry. Um...

05:55.721 --> 05:57.204
Did you, uh...

05:57.206 --> 05:59.858
You said $100,000?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.675
And $9,000, plus a yearly bonus,

06:01.677 --> 06:03.327
usually around $10,000.

06:03.329 --> 06:04.845
$10,000? Oh, excuse me.

06:04.847 --> 06:07.715
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
Sorry, sorry.

06:07.717 --> 06:09.450
Hello? Hello? Hi, hi, hi.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.951
- You still there?
- Yeah.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.280
Um, okay, so...

06:13.354 --> 06:16.490
so when you say $10,000,
you mean, like,

06:16.945 --> 06:19.129
on top of the previously
mentioned $9,000,

06:19.130 --> 06:20.454
or is it, like, a part of the $9,000

06:20.455 --> 06:21.795
so it's really just, like, $1,000?

06:21.797 --> 06:23.530
I don't know what that means,

06:23.532 --> 06:26.066
but it's a total of $119,000.

06:26.449 --> 06:28.676
And those are real,

06:28.677 --> 06:31.832
firm, rock-hard numbers?

06:32.059 --> 06:34.293
That's... I'm sorry
if that sounded over-sexual.

06:34.295 --> 06:35.911
I'm just looking for confirmation.

06:35.913 --> 06:38.397
Uh-huh. So I'll just fax
over the contract,

06:38.399 --> 06:40.132
and you can sign it
at your convenience.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.301
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, it's convenient right now.

06:42.303 --> 06:44.436
Uh, I could... I could do that
right now. Uh-huh.

06:44.438 --> 06:47.072
Do you want to hear about your perks?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.274
Holy [bleep]!

06:49.276 --> 06:53.145
Yes, I would like to, um, hear
about those, please.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:05.748 --> 07:07.484
Good morning, Sarah.

07:07.485 --> 07:08.622
Looking great!

07:10.002 --> 07:11.518
Good hustle, Brett!

07:12.972 --> 07:14.838
Hey, Sayid, you can go on a break.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.256
- I already had my break.
- Well, then it's

07:16.258 --> 07:17.841
a double-break day for you, my friend.

07:17.843 --> 07:19.035
You're in a good mood.

07:19.036 --> 07:20.953
♪ Somebody got laid ♪

07:20.954 --> 07:23.359
No, actually, I, um...

07:23.869 --> 07:25.318
I'm just very happy.

07:25.601 --> 07:26.723
I like my new job.

07:27.376 --> 07:28.658
Oh, also, hey, everyone?

07:28.687 --> 07:30.721
There are doughnuts in the break room.

07:30.921 --> 07:33.028
Ooh, who forgot their doughnuts?

07:33.029 --> 07:35.859
- No, I bought them.
- Okay.

07:35.861 --> 07:38.322
Nobody eat the doughnuts.
They're Amy's.

07:38.323 --> 07:39.362
No, that's not... I...

07:40.166 --> 07:42.477
Doesn't matter. Good job, everyone.

07:44.787 --> 07:46.580
She's so weird about her doughnuts.

07:47.623 --> 07:49.506
Hey, so I'm restocking this cereal,

07:49.508 --> 07:51.603
and there's something moving inside.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.877
It's definitely alive, because
I can hear it scratching.

07:53.879 --> 07:55.345
I don't care about a cereal roach.

07:55.347 --> 07:57.931
What I care about is you
keeping your big nose...

07:57.933 --> 07:59.516
that's not a slur, just an expression...

07:59.518 --> 08:01.463
- out of my business.
- What are you talking about?

08:01.464 --> 08:03.303
The way you [bleep] me
out of that security system.

08:03.305 --> 08:05.042
Let's keep something straight.
You're the boyfriend.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.774
I'm the assistant manager.

08:06.776 --> 08:09.193
You get this, and you get this,

08:09.195 --> 08:11.129
maybe this... that's between
you guys, I don't want to know.

08:11.130 --> 08:12.747
- Dina...
- I said I don't want to know.

08:12.748 --> 08:13.588
But this...

08:13.589 --> 08:16.667
everything north of the
fun park... this is my domain.

08:16.668 --> 08:17.826
So, basically, you're asking me

08:17.827 --> 08:19.552
to keep my opinions to myself

08:19.553 --> 08:21.321
and limit my relationship with Amy

08:21.323 --> 08:23.698
- to wordless, mindless sex.
- Exactly.

08:24.210 --> 08:26.315
Huh. I thought this was going
to be a harder conversation.

08:26.316 --> 08:28.563
I'm not saying no, but if I did,

08:28.564 --> 08:30.230
just out of curiosity,
what would happen?

08:30.232 --> 08:32.982
Help me out, man. Don't make
me make her dump you.

08:32.985 --> 08:34.284
Don't make me do that.

08:34.285 --> 08:36.153
I think I'm gonna make you do it.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.236
Fine.

08:37.239 --> 08:38.565
You had your chance.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.542
And, again, the nose thing wasn't...

08:41.544 --> 08:43.076
You get it. I love everyone.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.747
Marcus, I'm gonna need
you to fill in for Brett

08:46.749 --> 08:48.332
'cause he raged out
on someone's baby again.

08:48.334 --> 08:49.800
Sayid, clean the pharmacy counter.

08:49.802 --> 08:51.518
The kids have been inhaling
the pill dust.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.754
Why are you telling us what to do?

08:53.756 --> 08:55.472
You're not floor supervisor.

08:55.474 --> 08:56.590
Yeah, you're right.

08:56.972 --> 08:58.388
I just went to Office Supplies,

08:58.390 --> 09:00.190
picked up a clipboard,
filled it with blank paper,

09:00.192 --> 09:01.558
and started giving people orders,

09:01.560 --> 09:03.109
without any authority whatsoever.

09:03.111 --> 09:05.395
I mean, come on.

09:05.397 --> 09:08.461
Come on, get with the program, Sayid.

09:09.401 --> 09:12.732
Look, Jonah's a bimbo.
You're management now.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.691
You don't see Dale Federman
from the Clayton store

09:14.692 --> 09:16.697
walking around
with some floozy on his arm.

09:16.698 --> 09:18.398
Okay? Keep him at the kids' table.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.900
Yeah, no, those... you make
some really great points.

09:20.902 --> 09:23.736
- I'll keep them in mind.
- Well, just think about it.

09:23.738 --> 09:25.350
And if you need to have
some rebound sex,

09:25.367 --> 09:27.034
I'm happy to call my guy.

09:27.409 --> 09:29.056
He's great. Croatian.

09:30.262 --> 09:31.995
Myrtle, hey.

09:31.997 --> 09:34.664
- How are you?
- Oh, okay.

09:34.666 --> 09:36.633
You eating some ketchup there?

09:36.635 --> 09:38.802
They give me these packets for free.

09:38.804 --> 09:41.721
If you leave it in your
mouth, it gets warm

09:41.723 --> 09:44.641
and tastes just like... tomato soup.

09:45.593 --> 09:47.666
Um... uh...

09:48.263 --> 09:52.148
you know, if you're still
in between jobs,

09:52.150 --> 09:54.044
they just promoted me to manager.

09:54.045 --> 09:55.902
Of the Cardinals?

09:55.904 --> 09:57.854
No, of the store.

09:57.856 --> 09:59.522
And... and they told me

09:59.524 --> 10:00.990
that I could hire an assistant,

10:00.992 --> 10:02.878
but I don't really need
and assistant, so...

10:03.498 --> 10:05.966
Why don't I just hire you?

10:06.021 --> 10:07.329
Oh, really?

10:08.283 --> 10:11.334
I'll be the best assistant
you've ever had.

10:11.336 --> 10:13.411
No, no, no, you don't...
you don't have to come in.

10:13.412 --> 10:14.787
You can just take the money.

10:14.789 --> 10:16.956
I used to work for Mr. Nelson

10:16.958 --> 10:18.958
of Pan-American Airlines.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.011
I'll be here bright and early
every morning

10:22.013 --> 10:25.155
with your racing forms
and pipe tobacco.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.172
Great. Yeah, well, welcome aboard.

10:39.397 --> 10:40.012
Sorry.

10:42.824 --> 10:44.117
That sucks.

10:44.119 --> 10:45.735
Welcome to that floor-worker life.

10:45.737 --> 10:47.370
I wanted to rebuild it anyway,

10:47.372 --> 10:48.738
'cause I think if I make

10:48.740 --> 10:50.874
the base wider, I can go even higher.

10:50.876 --> 10:53.826
Glenn, you know, it's okay to complain.

10:53.828 --> 10:54.850
I do it all the time.

10:54.851 --> 10:57.747
- Well, I know you do.
- What's that supposed to mean?

10:57.749 --> 11:00.383
There's no such thing as a bad job.

11:00.385 --> 11:03.326
If you have a good
attitude, every job is fun.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.306
It's not my attitude.
This is a terrible job.

11:06.308 --> 11:08.143
Well, okay. Whatever you say.

Oh, hey, Myrtle.
What are you doing here?

11:21.907 --> 11:23.356
I just finished eating

11:23.358 --> 11:25.858
all the jelly beans she asked me to.

11:25.860 --> 11:28.067
Myrtle is my new assistant.

11:28.068 --> 11:29.662
- Oh.
- Yes.

11:29.664 --> 11:31.208
What should I do next?

11:31.520 --> 11:33.723
Um, why don't you take

11:33.724 --> 11:35.423
the sales announcements to Garrett?

11:35.424 --> 11:38.065
Oh, Garrett. Is he the...

11:38.423 --> 11:40.089
What do they like
to be called these days?

11:40.091 --> 11:42.008
No, no, no, no.
Let's not get into that.

11:42.010 --> 11:44.010
Just take it over to customer service.

11:44.012 --> 11:45.683
Aye, aye, Captain.

11:47.966 --> 11:50.883
You get an assistant...
and it's Myrtle?

11:50.884 --> 11:52.936
Well, I just wanted
to help the lady out.

11:52.938 --> 11:55.054
Besides, I am in a good mood.

11:55.056 --> 11:56.899
Ooh-hoo-hoo. What's going on?

11:57.976 --> 11:59.475
I just found out my salary.

11:59.477 --> 12:00.451
It's good?

12:01.363 --> 12:03.883
- I shouldn't say.
- You are dying to tell me.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.483
Yes, of course I'm dying to tell you.

12:05.484 --> 12:07.080
Okay, I'm not gonna tell you my salary,

12:07.081 --> 12:09.485
but will you please
hand me the contract

12:09.487 --> 12:11.454
that's sitting on my desk
while I check out something

12:11.456 --> 12:13.379
on my wall and I trust you not to look?

12:16.077 --> 12:17.485
"Attention Cloud 9 customers,

12:17.486 --> 12:19.212
do you have a pet fish you love?"

12:19.214 --> 12:21.859
No, that's... this is
the sale announcements.

12:21.860 --> 12:24.047
The sale announcements that Myrtle

12:24.048 --> 12:25.088
just took to Garrett?

12:27.088 --> 12:28.698
Get her! Myrtle!

12:28.923 --> 12:32.091
"Section 5, paragraph K... salary.

12:32.093 --> 12:33.490
"Employee shall be paid

12:33.491 --> 12:37.923
at the rate of $109,000 annually."

12:38.330 --> 12:41.698
Not sure why Amy wants you all
to know she makes 109K,

12:41.853 --> 12:43.436
but, uh, good for her.

12:43.438 --> 12:45.714
"Section 6... nondisclosure agreement."

12:46.494 --> 12:48.661
I fear that ship has sailed.

12:50.487 --> 12:51.654
I'm very sorry.

12:52.050 --> 12:53.687
Obviously, I didn't intend

12:53.742 --> 12:56.213
to tell everyone how much I was making.

12:56.614 --> 12:58.113
And, honestly, I'm quite surprised

12:58.115 --> 12:59.836
that anyone receiving that information

12:59.837 --> 13:01.901
from a clearly confused
and elderly woman

13:01.903 --> 13:03.196
would make that announcement.

13:03.197 --> 13:05.070
I'm a good soldier. I do what I'm told.

13:05.072 --> 13:07.004
Well, I just want to say,
it's awesome to see

13:07.005 --> 13:08.974
another floor supervisor doing so well.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.510
I think I speak for all
floor supervisors when I say

13:11.512 --> 13:12.828
you are an inspiration.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.830
Oh, okay. Thank you.

13:14.832 --> 13:16.126
It's probably tough on Jonah, though.

13:16.127 --> 13:17.558
Can't imagine where this is going.

13:17.559 --> 13:19.463
I'm just saying...
making so much less money

13:19.464 --> 13:22.004
than your girlfriend,
it's got to be emasculating.

13:22.006 --> 13:23.581
Probably makes it tough
to get an erection.

13:23.582 --> 13:25.315
My erections are fine, thank you.

13:25.843 --> 13:27.818
Fine? Lucky lady.

13:27.819 --> 13:30.062
I'm actually shocked
you're not making more.

13:30.064 --> 13:31.347
I mean, I thought a manager

13:31.349 --> 13:32.681
would at least make more than we do.

13:32.683 --> 13:34.416
- She does.
- Uh, I don't think so.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.569
- How much do you make?
- Same thing we all make...

13:36.571 --> 13:38.120
$134,000 a year.

13:39.768 --> 13:41.311
How do you make that much a year?

13:41.312 --> 13:44.527
52 weeks times 30 hours
a week times minimum wage...

13:44.529 --> 13:45.995
86 bucks an hour.

13:45.997 --> 13:48.747
No, no, no, no.
Minimum wage is $8.60 an hour.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.749
I must have missed a decimal point.

13:50.751 --> 13:53.035
So no part of you thought to question

13:53.037 --> 13:56.672
why you were making
$86 an hour to work retail?

13:56.674 --> 13:58.507
I thought that's what we all made.

13:58.509 --> 13:59.961
How do you guys live

13:59.962 --> 14:02.204
on under $134,000 a year?

14:02.205 --> 14:04.374
I cut the budget. I let people go.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.251
You're gonna have to pay that back.

14:06.252 --> 14:08.482
Oh, now you're taking his money?

14:08.483 --> 14:10.007
The rich get richer.

14:10.008 --> 14:12.285
No, it goes back
to corporate, not to me.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.890
And who pays you? Corporate.

14:14.892 --> 14:17.412
Funny how that works.
Follow the money, people.

14:17.413 --> 14:19.229
I can't pay that money back.

14:19.230 --> 14:20.834
I'm living hand to mouth as it is.

14:20.835 --> 14:23.535
I always say,
"Mo' money, mo' problems."

14:23.537 --> 14:26.588
That's what you say? You say that?

14:36.717 --> 14:39.750
Oop! Does anyone need
any extra mayonnaise?

14:39.751 --> 14:40.917
'Cause it's on me.

14:40.919 --> 14:42.502
Good one.

14:42.984 --> 14:44.721
It's nice that you can find
the humor in all this.

14:44.722 --> 14:46.068
Well, full disclosure...

14:46.070 --> 14:47.768
I stole that from "Hi and Lois."

14:47.769 --> 14:48.949
Hey, you know, if I was in your shoes,

14:48.950 --> 14:51.312
I'd just be thinking
about that $90,000 a year

14:51.313 --> 14:52.589
that I walked away from.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.592
You know, over the next 20
years, that's $1.8 million?

14:56.080 --> 14:59.085
So I don't think anybody would blame
you if you were a little upset.

14:59.086 --> 15:00.527
No, I'm fine.

15:01.319 --> 15:03.353
Hey, but do you feel like a BLT?

15:03.608 --> 15:05.741
I do, 'cause I'm covered in mayonnaise!

15:05.743 --> 15:07.697
BLT!

15:07.698 --> 15:09.915
Oh, my God. I am literally dead.

15:10.337 --> 15:11.953
No, Justine, it's not funny!

15:11.955 --> 15:14.403
He's a miserable man,
and it's a terrible job.

15:15.938 --> 15:17.117
Clean that up, dork.

15:18.261 --> 15:19.029
Uh-oh.

15:19.930 --> 15:23.014
Clean up on aisle
have-what-she's-having.

15:23.016 --> 15:25.300
Stop!

15:25.302 --> 15:26.601
I'm gonna pee my pants.

15:26.603 --> 15:28.436
Well, if you do,
I'll clean that up, too.

15:28.438 --> 15:31.139
Stop! Oh, it's happening!

15:31.141 --> 15:32.390
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah.

15:32.392 --> 15:34.776
Not again.

15:34.778 --> 15:36.611
Floor Supervisor Mateo Liwanag

15:36.613 --> 15:38.095
to Customer Service, please.

15:38.448 --> 15:40.982
Floor Supervisor Mateo Liwanag

15:40.984 --> 15:42.817
to customer service.

15:44.237 --> 15:46.321
Oh.

15:46.323 --> 15:48.456
That's me. Got to take it.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.211
Whoo!

15:49.872 --> 15:51.322
You know who you should date

15:51.578 --> 15:53.795
is that hot guy that you
came in with last week.

15:53.797 --> 15:54.712
Oh, maybe.

15:54.782 --> 15:56.969
Two problems...
he's gay, and he's my brother.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.167
Mm, I don't know.
You guys had good chemistry.

15:59.169 --> 16:02.554
- Oh, what happened here?
- I think it's slushie vomit.

16:02.556 --> 16:04.305
And there's a whole
sandwich in the middle,

16:04.307 --> 16:07.185
but I'm pretty sure someone
just dropped it in after.

16:07.186 --> 16:08.029
Yeah, probably.

16:08.045 --> 16:10.045
People don't usually eat those whole.

16:11.202 --> 16:13.431
- Are you okay?
- Oh.

16:13.433 --> 16:14.983
My knees are just acting up.

16:14.985 --> 16:16.484
I'm trying not to go to the doctor

16:16.486 --> 16:18.102
'cause I'm saving up for a bike.

16:18.104 --> 16:20.855
The bus driver keeps trying
to drive me to his house.

16:20.857 --> 16:22.774
Well, why don't you go take a break?

16:22.776 --> 16:24.325
I'll clean this up. I can do this.

16:24.327 --> 16:26.444
What are you doing?
You're the manager...

16:26.446 --> 16:28.090
not some vomit girl like Sandra.

16:28.191 --> 16:29.075
It's fine.

16:29.152 --> 16:32.108
Some of it is mine, actually,
you know, 'cause of the smell.

16:32.836 --> 16:34.031
Look, guys, it's not like

16:34.032 --> 16:36.677
I'm above cleaning up vomit now.

16:36.678 --> 16:39.591
I'm still, "Amy from the block, girl."

16:39.593 --> 16:41.709
- Thank you.
- Amy, corporate just sent you

16:41.711 --> 16:43.428
a welcome basket with champagne.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.380
- Where should I put it?
- Just anywhere.

16:45.382 --> 16:46.121
Anywhere is fine.

16:46.122 --> 16:47.765
Okay, I'll put it in your Lexus.

16:47.767 --> 16:50.100
Whoa. You have a Lexus?

16:50.101 --> 16:51.803
No, of course not.

16:51.805 --> 16:53.688
There's also a man outside
waiting for you

16:53.690 --> 16:55.056
with your company car.

16:55.058 --> 16:55.705
It's a Lexus.

16:57.310 --> 16:58.810
Oh, uh, well...

16:59.479 --> 17:02.313
I guess I should probably go
sign for it, then.

17:02.315 --> 17:04.531
Um, sorry.

17:04.534 --> 17:06.367
Next time. Can I just...

17:06.368 --> 17:08.069
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Ow. Ow.

17:10.957 --> 17:12.973
Yeah, you're gonna need
to get all of that.

17:14.751 --> 17:17.480
I don't know how I'm gonna
pay back corporate. I'm broke.

17:17.921 --> 17:20.137
How? You live with your mother.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.007
Your car doesn't have any doors.

17:22.009 --> 17:25.260
And you've been making
$134,000 every year

17:25.262 --> 17:26.744
for the last six years.

17:26.747 --> 17:29.058
- Where does all the money go?
- I don't know.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.074
I get the guacamole
from Chipotle every time.

17:32.409 --> 17:36.287
Excuse me, do you sell any
books by David Foster Wallace?

17:36.990 --> 17:38.607
Uh, no, sorry.

17:38.609 --> 17:39.687
I keep suggesting it,

17:39.688 --> 17:42.944
but the employees all just make
"Infinite Jest" of me.

17:45.082 --> 17:46.615
You're so funny.

17:46.617 --> 17:48.823
Do you want to go outside
and do it in your car?

17:49.586 --> 17:50.207
Uh...

17:50.921 --> 17:52.370
This young lady says

17:52.372 --> 17:54.873
she was paid to seduce me,
record it on tape,

17:54.875 --> 17:56.708
and then give that tape
to the store manager.

17:56.710 --> 17:58.554
I requested a nerdy
girl-next-door type.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.712
You're just a bad girl they
stuck a pair of glasses on.

18:00.714 --> 18:03.298
Look, I'm sorry you're not
getting your security system,

18:03.300 --> 18:05.100
but Amy and I are not gonna break up.

18:05.102 --> 18:07.219
I can't believe you hired a prostitute.

18:07.221 --> 18:09.779
Sorry, sex worker. You have agency.

18:10.974 --> 18:13.141
So should I go?

18:13.143 --> 18:15.310
I paid for two hours.
You may as well help Justine

18:15.312 --> 18:17.646
re-price towels to match the new EDLPs.

18:17.648 --> 18:18.293
Follow me.

18:19.032 --> 18:19.892
Come on.

18:22.703 --> 18:24.809
Oh, hey, Amy, this lady wants to use

18:24.810 --> 18:27.109
her EBT card to pay for diapers.

18:27.703 --> 18:30.538
Yeah, we can't do that.
They won't let us.

18:30.581 --> 18:32.023
Do you know how expensive diapers are?

18:32.024 --> 18:34.907
Yeah, I do, actually.
I also have a baby.

18:34.908 --> 18:37.659
Well, you also make $109,000 a year,

18:37.661 --> 18:39.628
so you're not exactly in the same boat.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.164
Well, I wasn't saying
that I was in the same boat.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.716
I was just saying that I
understand the cost of diapers.

18:44.718 --> 18:47.169
I mean, obviously, I can...
I can pay for diapers.

18:47.171 --> 18:48.961
Really? Thank you.

18:49.306 --> 18:51.723
- That's generous of you.
- Oh, no, no. No.

18:51.725 --> 18:52.924
Sorry, I wasn't saying

18:52.926 --> 18:54.342
that I could pay for your diapers.

18:54.344 --> 18:56.061
- Oh.
- I mean, I would.

18:56.063 --> 18:58.814
It's just that if I went around
buying everyone's diapers

18:58.816 --> 19:01.349
who's on food stamps, I'd be
broke in, like, a day.

19:01.351 --> 19:03.516
Sure, it's fine. I'll buy them myself.

19:04.271 --> 19:06.905
- God bless America.
- I know, right?

19:06.907 --> 19:08.774
I'm sorry. I just... I don't...
I don't understand

19:08.776 --> 19:11.647
why it's my responsibility
to buy your diapers.

19:13.863 --> 19:15.580
You know what? Fine. Okay, cool.

19:15.582 --> 19:18.166
Yeah, I can... I can buy these diapers.

19:18.168 --> 19:19.211
Run the card.

19:22.339 --> 19:23.955
But I'm... I'm not paying for the candy.

19:23.957 --> 19:26.792
Oh! So, because you're rich,
you know what's best for me,

19:26.794 --> 19:28.710
and I'm just too fat for candy?

19:28.712 --> 19:30.500
No, that is not what I said.

19:32.132 --> 19:34.839
I will pay for the candy, obviously.

19:35.469 --> 19:37.803
Garrett, I just found
the funniest thing

19:37.805 --> 19:38.970
while I was cleaning.

19:38.972 --> 19:41.825
It was a rat inside a used condom.

19:42.239 --> 19:44.976
I was like, "How did you
get in there, little fella?"

19:44.978 --> 19:46.478
This is a bad job, okay?

19:46.843 --> 19:49.358
This is a soul-crushing,
miserable place to work.

19:49.817 --> 19:51.733
I know that. I know that in my heart.

19:51.735 --> 19:55.261
Nothing you say will ever,
ever take that away from me.

19:58.992 --> 19:59.909
Okay.

20:00.711 --> 20:01.666
See you later.

20:05.883 --> 20:08.475
Hi! Welcome to Cloud 9.

20:09.586 --> 20:12.170
Oh, why, thank you!

20:12.172 --> 20:15.173
Do you like cool savings?

20:15.578 --> 20:16.808
Yes, I do.

20:16.810 --> 20:21.146
Why not check out
our frozen treats in Grocery?

20:21.148 --> 20:24.559
Oh, I will. Thank you so much.

20:25.462 --> 20:27.128
Frozen treats.

20:32.526 --> 20:35.385
Hey, Mateo, after I do
go-backs, I'm gonna take 15?

20:35.389 --> 20:36.344
Thanks, Joelle.

20:39.893 --> 20:41.480
Hmm.

20:44.788 --> 20:46.288
Everything okay?

20:46.290 --> 20:47.873
Rough day.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.124
Yeah, I heard.

20:49.126 --> 20:50.175
If it makes you feel any better,

20:50.176 --> 20:51.911
I turned down sex
with a hooker for you.

20:51.912 --> 20:54.425
Oh! That does make me feel better.

20:55.232 --> 20:57.032
I can't wait for this day to be over.

20:57.034 --> 20:58.200
I need a drink.

20:58.202 --> 21:00.235
So let's go get a drink!

21:00.237 --> 21:01.486
It's the middle of the day.

21:01.488 --> 21:03.071
Oh, yeah. That's right.

21:03.073 --> 21:04.940
You don't want to get
in trouble with your boss.

21:06.313 --> 21:07.195
Oh, wait.

21:08.745 --> 21:09.606
I'm the boss.

21:09.607 --> 21:11.485
Yeah, that's where I
was going with that.

21:12.641 --> 21:14.249
- Let's go get a drink.
- All right.

21:14.251 --> 21:15.834
But you're paying.

21:15.836 --> 21:17.863
You won't stop bragging
about how much money you make.

21:17.864 --> 21:20.222
- $109,000.
- All right, all right.

21:20.224 --> 21:22.123
- Plus perks.
- What?
