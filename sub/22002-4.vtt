I'm already dressed.

Well... I'm also dressed,

00:17.364 --> 00:19.037
and I made breakfast.

00:19.114 --> 00:22.340
- Wait, where are my eggs?
- In my belly.

00:48.275 --> 00:50.798
Some of you have asked me
what got me through prison.

00:50.856 --> 00:52.918
Was it my family?
Don't be stupid.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.611
Was it knowing that my friends
would eventually get me out?

00:55.650 --> 00:57.584
Of course not, I never
believed in any of you.

00:57.651 --> 00:59.334
No, the only thing that
kept me sane

00:59.392 --> 01:00.954
was planning for the
Halloween heist

01:01.021 --> 01:02.879
those many years doing hard time.

01:02.946 --> 01:05.012
- It was eight weeks.
- I also went to prison, dog.

01:05.078 --> 01:07.161
- We're getting off track here.
- No, we're not, dog.

01:07.228 --> 01:09.186
Peralta's just trying to
play the sympathy card

01:09.244 --> 01:10.297
so we all go easy on him.

01:10.364 --> 01:12.248
I'd rather send you back to prison

01:12.306 --> 01:13.986
- than see you win.
- Okay.

01:14.044 --> 01:16.235
This year, we compete for
the most elegant and regal

01:16.302 --> 01:17.806
of all prizes...

01:17.938 --> 01:19.706
A championship cummerbund.

01:19.773 --> 01:21.341
Or belt, as normal people call it.

01:21.408 --> 01:23.243
Belt... I'd like to
see the pair of slacks

01:23.310 --> 01:25.259
whose loops are large
enough for this belt.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.845
No, it is a cummerbund.

01:26.903 --> 01:28.385
- Well, whatever it is...
- Cummerbund.

01:28.442 --> 01:31.293
It's inscribed with the words,
"Amazing human/genius."

01:31.351 --> 01:33.887
The objective is to have it in
your possession at midnight.

01:33.954 --> 01:35.656
This year, the competition
is not limited

01:35.723 --> 01:37.471
- to winners of the past heists.
- That's right.

01:37.528 --> 01:39.404
Any man, or woman has to

01:39.462 --> 01:40.861
... can enterinto it.

01:40.928 --> 01:43.162
- It's open to everyone.
- Ooh, every man for himself.

01:43.229 --> 01:44.783
It's like "Bachelor in Paradise."

01:44.850 --> 01:46.979
It's really cool that you
guys opened it up to anyone.

01:47.046 --> 01:48.339
Thanks. Yeah,
we talked about it,

01:48.396 --> 01:49.612
and we just felt like
it was only fair.

01:49.669 --> 01:51.091
I was being sarcastic.
You all suck,

01:51.148 --> 01:52.548
and I hope Jake goes back to jail.

01:52.626 --> 01:54.939
Oh, cool, I'm glad everyone feels
comfortable joking about that.

01:54.997 --> 01:56.634
- Not joking.
- Insult me all you want,

01:56.692 --> 01:57.970
for I have only this to say...

01:58.178 --> 01:59.935
Victory shall be mine!

02:00.002 --> 02:02.706
I heard you practicing in the shower.
You can't surprise me.

02:02.773 --> 02:05.175
Letting me into your life was
the worst mistake you ever made.

02:05.232 --> 02:06.733
Cool, fun take on our relationship.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.608
Well, I for one thing you're
perfect for each other...

02:08.664 --> 02:09.713
Feel like there's gonna be more.

02:09.770 --> 02:11.705
- Because you're both losers.
- There it is.

02:11.763 --> 02:14.622
None of you stand a chance against me.
No courage, no patience,

02:14.680 --> 02:15.718
no brains,

02:15.776 --> 02:18.793
and, of course, a bald old man.

02:18.892 --> 02:19.939
I'm younger than you.

02:20.026 --> 02:21.689
No comeback for the bald thing,
I see.

02:21.763 --> 02:23.712
Yeah,
I'm not doing the heist. I'm out.

02:23.830 --> 02:24.905
Okay.

02:24.972 --> 02:26.406
- Bull crap.
- Yeah, right.

02:26.473 --> 02:27.853
Just like
you were out last year.

02:27.911 --> 02:30.673
- I was out last year.
- As a setup for this year.

02:30.778 --> 02:32.746
You're good, Jeffords,
but not good enough.

02:32.813 --> 02:35.515
In fact, you're an idiot.
I should've fired you long ago.

02:35.582 --> 02:37.353
- What?
- Relax, Terry, chill out.

02:37.493 --> 02:38.954
Get your undies out of your buns.

02:39.064 --> 02:40.787
Now, if everyone would rise.

02:40.854 --> 02:43.089
Rise like the army of the dead,

02:43.156 --> 02:46.236
and follow me into the
bullpen of destiny.

02:46.665 --> 02:47.837
This heist,

02:47.996 --> 02:50.275
the belt will not be
locked up or hidden away.

02:50.531 --> 02:53.189
It will be suspended from
the ceiling in plain sight

02:53.298 --> 02:54.868
- for all to see.
- How poetic.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.725
It will hang just out of reach,

02:56.783 --> 02:58.529
like Tantalus's fruit.

02:58.587 --> 03:00.740
Yes, that's where I got
the inspiration from,

03:00.798 --> 03:03.510
Greek mythology, not an episode
of the Nickelodeon show "Guts."

03:03.577 --> 03:05.173
Amy, will you please do the honors?

03:05.231 --> 03:06.459
Mm-hmm.

03:09.216 --> 03:12.376
- The belt is in place.
- Whoever has it at midnight

03:12.517 --> 03:13.934
will be declared the...

03:14.001 --> 03:15.134
What's going on?

03:15.236 --> 03:16.556
- What's happening?
- I can't see!

03:16.623 --> 03:18.228
Everybody just grab
something random.

03:18.286 --> 03:19.401
Back off, Hitchcock.

03:19.526 --> 03:20.827
Silence!

03:20.978 --> 03:23.142
It's gone.
The cummerbund is gone!

03:23.220 --> 03:25.587
Who took it? We're all here.
Where'd it go?

03:25.665 --> 03:27.734
Nowhere.
It's still in this room.

03:27.892 --> 03:31.505
In fact, it's right here!

03:31.587 --> 03:33.306
Nope, it's just your tum-tum.

03:33.373 --> 03:37.276
I don't have the cummerbund,
because it's right here!

03:37.486 --> 03:40.514
Or is it right here?

03:40.581 --> 03:41.948
Everybody stop undressing.

03:42.015 --> 03:43.649
We just had harassment training.

03:43.716 --> 03:46.520
<i>Hey... over here, losers.</i>

03:46.587 --> 03:48.108
<i>This is Gina Linetti.</i>

03:48.175 --> 03:50.156
<i>You really thought you
could do this without me?</i>

03:50.223 --> 03:51.925
<i>I'm the defending champion.</i>

03:51.992 --> 03:54.462
Gina... I should have known
it was you, you punk.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.205
Yeah, you punk,

03:56.263 --> 03:58.139
why aren't you showing
your face, you punk?

03:58.206 --> 03:59.433
<i>Yeah, I just had a baby.</i>

03:59.500 --> 04:01.358
<i>I haven't washed my hair
in three weeks.</i>

04:01.425 --> 04:02.669
Oh, how is she?

04:02.736 --> 04:04.877
- Yeah, how's she doing?
<i>- None of your business.</i>

04:04.944 --> 04:07.162
<i>Now, if you wanna find the belt,</i>

04:07.220 --> 04:08.708
<i>you're gonna have to work for it.</i>

04:08.775 --> 04:10.877
<i>Behind my desk are boxes of baby stuff</i>

04:10.944 --> 04:12.713
<i>that I didn't wanna assemble.</i>

04:12.780 --> 04:15.248
<i>You get a clue for each
item you put together.</i>

04:15.323 --> 04:17.619
<i>Linetti, Lin-out-ti.</i>

04:17.677 --> 04:18.767
This is crazy.

04:18.833 --> 04:21.994
I mean, no one is actually gonna
do Gina's dumb chores, right?

04:22.055 --> 04:23.589
Right, absolutely not.

04:23.647 --> 04:25.182
It's completely ridiculous.

04:28.462 --> 04:30.363
I got the reach-and-play!

04:30.430 --> 04:32.165
You can all suck it!

04:37.905 --> 04:41.194
- They fell for it.
- Hook, line, and sphincter.

04:41.261 --> 04:43.165
- It's sinker.
- No, it's sphincter.

04:43.223 --> 04:45.018
That's where you put the
hook in when you're eeling.

04:45.075 --> 04:46.931
Well, I never use that
expression again.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.681
- Hey, guys.
- Ah.

04:48.802 --> 04:51.504
- And right on time, here's Bill.
- Welcome.

04:51.571 --> 04:53.978
Man, it is amazing how
similar you guys look.

04:54.036 --> 04:55.245
- I don't see it.
- Me neither.

04:55.302 --> 04:56.315
- Not even a little.
- Not at all.

04:56.372 --> 04:58.080
Twins. So,
did you have any issues

04:58.142 --> 05:00.023
- getting into the vents?
- Went like clockwork.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.126
Sir, only authorized personnel
are allowed up here.

05:03.229 --> 05:05.072
Oh, Detective Boyle,
didn't see it was you.

05:05.137 --> 05:06.939
Get better eyes, you moron.

05:07.118 --> 05:09.611
Ah, man, I'm friends with Officer Lou.

05:09.669 --> 05:11.603
Not anymore. He was very upset.

05:11.839 --> 05:14.060
Anyway, once I got in the vents,
it was smooth sailing.

05:14.127 --> 05:15.634
The belt is in place.

05:15.692 --> 05:18.514
Whoever has it at midnight
will be declared the winner

05:18.572 --> 05:20.346
of the fifth annual...

05:20.413 --> 05:21.674
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

05:21.731 --> 05:23.845
I can't see! Everyone just
grab something randomly.

05:23.903 --> 05:25.444
Back off, Hitchcock.

05:29.776 --> 05:31.678
Hey, over here, losers.

05:31.745 --> 05:33.946
I gotta say, Bill,
your Gina impression was spot-on.

05:34.013 --> 05:35.085
I'm very good at roleplay,

05:35.152 --> 05:36.832
and I'm super comfortable wearing masks.

05:36.899 --> 05:38.789
Right, I forgot you were
maybe a male prostitute.

05:38.846 --> 05:40.203
I was definitely a male prostitute,

05:40.260 --> 05:41.440
but I don't do that profession anymore.

05:41.497 --> 05:43.173
Now I sell vitamin supplements.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.556
I made $90,000 this year alone,

05:45.614 --> 05:47.448
working out of the
comfort of my own home.

05:47.506 --> 05:48.534
- Uh-huh?
- How did I do it?

05:48.591 --> 05:49.619
- NutriBoom.
- Right.

05:49.677 --> 05:51.292
And the good news is,
you can do it too.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.812
Okay, this is clearly a pyramid
scheme. We're not interested.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.179
Okay, your loss.

05:55.237 --> 05:57.171
- Here's the belt...
- Ah...

05:57.229 --> 05:59.265
- she's a beauty.
- Hi-yah!

05:59.506 --> 06:01.345
Ow! Charles, what are you doing?

06:01.412 --> 06:03.257
The hardest thing I've
<i>ever done</i> : betraying you.

06:03.314 --> 06:04.663
Bill, the belt.

06:04.769 --> 06:06.311
- Bill, you're in on this too?
- Yep.

06:06.376 --> 06:08.122
Charles promised he'd
buy a ton of supplements

06:08.179 --> 06:09.566
and become one of my
downstream distributors.

06:09.623 --> 06:11.299
No, look, listen to me,
don't do this, okay?

06:11.356 --> 06:13.533
I really need to win this year.
I'm begging you.

06:13.611 --> 06:15.712
Those baby browns aren't
gonna work on me, not today.

06:15.770 --> 06:16.775
This is crazy.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.730
You're never gonna get out of
here with that belt on your own.

06:18.787 --> 06:20.689
I'm not on my own.
I have an alliance.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.853
An alliance.

06:23.911 --> 06:26.369
It's not "Bachelor in
Paradise." It's "Survivor."

06:26.499 --> 06:28.211
Rosa,
I am very disappointed in you.

06:28.278 --> 06:29.401
Your approval means
nothing to me.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.790
Copy that. And Terry,
I knew you were playing.

06:31.863 --> 06:34.080
- Last year was a setup.
- Hell yeah, it was.

06:34.140 --> 06:35.767
I'm sick of you, Amy,
and Holt winning.

06:35.825 --> 06:38.408
- You're all so damn smug.
- Yeah, you guys may be champs,

06:38.506 --> 06:41.787
but this year... this year
belongs to The Tramps.

06:41.845 --> 06:43.690
- Charles, that's a bad name.
- Ha, you're just jealous.

06:43.747 --> 06:45.001
- Everyone loves it.
- No.

06:45.059 --> 06:47.165
- Nuh-uh.
- Bill, keep an eye on him.

06:47.223 --> 06:50.246
Let's go, Tramps. Charles, no! No!

06:50.437 --> 06:52.866
Hey, let me ask you this,
how would you like to be your own boss?

06:52.923 --> 06:54.035
Not now, Bill!

06:58.689 --> 07:00.580
Amy! Amy, in here!

07:00.671 --> 07:02.189
In here. Help.

07:03.495 --> 07:05.370
- Hello, fake Charles.
- Hi.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.848
Hello, tied-up Jake.

07:06.914 --> 07:08.505
Will you please help me
get out of this?

07:08.562 --> 07:10.393
It's not for the heist.
I just really have to pee.

07:10.450 --> 07:13.322
I know you don't drink water.
You pee once every two days.

07:13.438 --> 07:15.706
- And you went this morning.
- Damn it, you know me so well.

07:15.763 --> 07:16.708
All right, how about this?

07:16.766 --> 07:19.720
I've got top secret info
about various dealings.

07:19.866 --> 07:21.475
If you let me out of these cuffs,

07:21.533 --> 07:23.490
- I'll share it with you.
- What kind of info?

07:23.548 --> 07:25.545
Well, first off, Wolf Gina...

07:25.603 --> 07:28.009
Was just a ruse so you and
Charles could steal the belt.

07:28.306 --> 07:29.967
Yeah-huh, but also...

07:30.025 --> 07:32.670
Charles teamed up with Rosa
and Terry to form The Tramps.

07:32.728 --> 07:33.951
Gah! How did you know that?

07:34.009 --> 07:35.580
I gave Charles the idea last year.

07:36.869 --> 07:38.830
Gina's one of the champs.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.920
And I'm just one of the tramps.

07:40.978 --> 07:43.080
Ooh, The Tramps.

07:43.298 --> 07:45.415
That's a great name for something.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.462
I just don't know what.

07:48.798 --> 07:49.865
But I do.

07:49.923 --> 07:52.556
I told you, I'll always
be one step ahead of you.

07:52.626 --> 07:54.704
You can't surprise me.
Ya boring.

07:54.771 --> 07:56.507
You know what spices up
a relationship?

07:56.565 --> 07:58.353
Co-owning a multi-tiered marketing...

07:58.431 --> 07:59.867
Ignore him.
Look, there are three Tramps.

07:59.924 --> 08:01.627
The only way we're gonna
win is if we team up.

08:01.684 --> 08:04.595
Good point.
I guess my response is,

08:04.798 --> 08:06.824
rot in hell, crap-face!

08:06.891 --> 08:08.541
Also, I love you, and I treasure you,

08:08.608 --> 08:11.069
- and ya bore me.
- God, you're being so mean.

08:11.688 --> 08:13.667
- Do it more.
- I hope you die.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.197
Bye.

08:15.415 --> 08:18.824
Fine! Go! Who needs you,
ya freakin' jag!

08:19.315 --> 08:21.308
Looks like we're all clear.
Good job, guys.

08:21.366 --> 08:23.917
Oh, nothing can stop
this Tramp train.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.441
Boyle, stop finding
variations on a word we hate.

08:26.499 --> 08:28.273
Okay, Sarge, lift up
the super heavy thing

08:28.331 --> 08:30.025
that no one else is
strong enough to lift.

08:34.868 --> 08:37.562
Nice, Sarge! Keep lifting
heavy stuff like that,

08:37.620 --> 08:39.294
and maybe you'll work off
some of that bulk, huh?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.688
- What?
- I set up an electric eye yesterday,

08:41.756 --> 08:43.796
so if anyone enters this room,
an alarm will go off.

08:43.863 --> 08:46.371
Let's move. Don't cross the beam.

08:53.058 --> 08:56.081
Cool, yeah, that's something I
can do, without any problem.

08:58.878 --> 09:00.097
Alarm works.

09:01.511 --> 09:02.556
All right, fine,

09:02.623 --> 09:04.969
looks like I'm gonna have
to "127 Hours" this sitch.

09:05.027 --> 09:07.146
- You're gonna cut off your own arm?
- Is that how it ends?

09:07.203 --> 09:09.167
Oh, man, I got busy,
and my rental period expired.

09:09.234 --> 09:11.970
I thought he just wiggled out.
Come, will you just please un-cuff me?

09:12.037 --> 09:13.064
Please, you gotta, man.

09:13.131 --> 09:15.206
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.495
- You just did.
- Touché.

09:17.636 --> 09:19.425
All right,
how about this? I will buy...

09:19.566 --> 09:21.468
double the amount of
supplements that Boyle did.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.186
- $8,000?
- What? He gave you 4 grand?

09:24.253 --> 09:26.375
All right, fine, I'm in.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.152
He didn't give it to me.
He invested it in his future.

09:29.253 --> 09:31.261
- And you can too.
- Yeah, I already agreed to it.

09:31.339 --> 09:33.504
- You don't have to keep selling me.
- Sorry, the script we're given

09:33.561 --> 09:35.066
anticipates a lot more resistance.

09:35.269 --> 09:36.828
Okay, so let's get the
paperwork started.

09:36.885 --> 09:38.680
First things first, you are not allowed

09:38.738 --> 09:40.364
to have any of this
reviewed by an attorney.

09:40.421 --> 09:41.469
Yeah, this seems bad.

09:41.575 --> 09:43.195
So, where on Gina's mobile

09:43.253 --> 09:45.527
should I place this moonless Jupiter?

09:45.605 --> 09:48.289
I pity the child who lies
beneath this solar system.

09:48.347 --> 09:50.566
Hey, Captain, something's
going on with this heist.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.175
You tell us everything you know,

09:52.308 --> 09:53.774
and we'll tell you everything we know.

09:53.831 --> 09:55.654
- I'd rather not.
- Jokes on you,

09:55.712 --> 09:58.039
- we don't know anything.
- Well, good day then.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.399
- Wait, why are you sweating?
- I'm not sweating.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.883
No, I've had enough heart attacks

10:01.941 --> 10:04.456
to know what sweating looks
like, and that's sweat.

10:08.214 --> 10:10.722
Well, if I'm sweating,
as you claim,

10:10.824 --> 10:13.716
it's because I was watching
an exciting video on the net.

10:13.783 --> 10:15.503
<i>Really? What?</i>

10:15.652 --> 10:18.245
It was a video of an American gymnast.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.019
His leotard ripped, exposing his butt.

10:21.198 --> 10:23.066
- It was highly erotic.
- You're lying.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.253
I.T. just installed blocker software,

10:25.334 --> 10:27.169
<i>- thanks to moi.
- Uh, yes,</i>

10:27.354 --> 10:29.489
but they didn't install
it on my computer,

10:29.547 --> 10:30.988
because I'm a captain.

10:31.129 --> 10:33.062
You don't look hot and
bothered at all to me.

10:33.129 --> 10:34.558
- Show us the erotica.
- Gentlemen,

10:34.616 --> 10:36.351
<i>I assure you, there's nothing to see.</i>

10:36.460 --> 10:40.136
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to grab some fresh air.

10:47.937 --> 10:50.239
Good boy, Cheddar.
Bring me that cummerbund.

10:50.392 --> 10:51.777
Oh, yeah.

10:53.730 --> 10:55.366
Wait a minute...

10:55.511 --> 10:57.634
this isn't the championship cummerbund.

10:57.701 --> 11:00.019
This is some common cummerbund.

11:00.571 --> 11:03.583
And you're not Cheddar.
You're just some common bitch.

11:03.894 --> 11:05.821
And this says you've received
your sales training.

11:05.878 --> 11:07.378
- Great.
- And this one is

11:07.436 --> 11:09.927
a sworn affidavit stating that
you have seen Debbie Stovelman,

11:10.136 --> 11:12.011
the wife of NutriBoom founder,
David Stovelman,

11:12.078 --> 11:14.269
and that you found her to be
happy, healthy, and alive.

11:14.336 --> 11:15.776
Okay, fine. Great, all right, done.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.221
Just get me out of these.

11:20.235 --> 11:22.503
Hey, what's going on here?

11:24.662 --> 11:27.597
Yeah! Didn't think I could get
out of my cuffs, did you, Boyle?

11:27.664 --> 11:29.666
But you forgot about
one important thing...

11:29.733 --> 11:32.436
- NutriBoom.
- NutriBoom! That's right.

11:32.503 --> 11:34.438
I'm in the President's Circle now.

11:34.505 --> 11:36.873
Sorry, Charles, this year's
heist was just too important.

11:36.940 --> 11:39.510
- Watch him, Bill.
<i>- Check in, Boyle, check in.</i>

11:39.577 --> 11:41.845
Uh-oh, Jake, they check
in every ten minutes,

11:41.912 --> 11:46.017
and I have to respond
with a code only we know.

11:47.918 --> 11:49.734
- I am a Tramp.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

11:49.801 --> 11:51.334
Did I guess it? Did I guess the code?

11:51.401 --> 11:53.807
I couldn't hear what Rosa said
back, but was that right?

11:53.874 --> 11:55.509
- You got it.
- Yeah, I thought so, okay.

11:56.227 --> 11:58.662
Okay, security system, talk to me.

11:58.729 --> 12:00.830
What have I missed? What's going on?

12:00.897 --> 12:03.767
Ah-ha! Holt used Cheddar
to steal the belt.

12:03.834 --> 12:05.247
But that's not Cheddar.

12:05.314 --> 12:07.331
Holt and Cheddar always
walk in a perfect lockstep.

12:07.398 --> 12:08.715
Which means someone took Cheddar,

12:08.772 --> 12:10.340
and that person has the belt.

12:10.407 --> 12:14.074
But who? Who took Cheddar?

12:14.721 --> 12:17.027
- Where are you coming from?
- Why do you care?

12:17.105 --> 12:18.749
- Thought you weren't heisting.
- I'm not.

12:18.816 --> 12:20.717
I'm just interested in
your comings and goings,

12:20.784 --> 12:22.551
because I care about you as a friend.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.348
Okay, friend, I went to the bathroom.

12:24.415 --> 12:26.290
Well, you were gone a long time, friend.

12:26.357 --> 12:28.558
- You feeling okay, friend?
- No, it was number two,

12:28.625 --> 12:31.394
and it was very intense, friend.

12:31.461 --> 12:33.263
Bless you.

12:33.534 --> 12:35.432
She sneezed. Dog allergies.

12:35.499 --> 12:37.701
Which means that Amy took...

12:37.768 --> 12:39.403
Cheddar!

12:40.565 --> 12:42.253
Where is my dog?

12:42.363 --> 12:44.064
Aren't you standing
right next to him?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.409
This bitch? Please. Watch.

12:46.476 --> 12:48.378
Shake. Shake.

12:49.284 --> 12:50.413
Idiot.

12:50.566 --> 12:52.316
I know one of you took Cheddar,

12:52.383 --> 12:54.184
and you did it for the
sake of the heist,

12:54.251 --> 12:57.121
but if anything happens
to him, I will end you.

12:57.188 --> 12:59.289
I couldn't bring myself
to neuter Cheddar,

12:59.356 --> 13:01.589
but I will neuter you all.

13:02.937 --> 13:04.679
Uh, bing-pot.

13:07.507 --> 13:10.769
♪♪

13:10.826 --> 13:12.628
♪♪

13:12.777 --> 13:15.276
Cheddar? Cheddar?

13:15.579 --> 13:16.595
Shake.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.715
Ah, good grip, pristine coat.

13:18.782 --> 13:20.045
That's my doggie!

13:20.112 --> 13:22.348
You betrayed me.
You'll explain yourself later.

13:22.415 --> 13:24.199
Return to my office.

13:25.155 --> 13:27.791
Guys, why is there smoke
coming from the break room?

13:27.858 --> 13:29.759
What's going on?
Is someone doing something?

13:29.826 --> 13:32.162
Who's doing something?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.575
"Handmaid's Tale." This is Amy.

13:33.642 --> 13:35.749
She won't shut up about
how relevant that show is

13:35.816 --> 13:38.301
- in today's political landscape.
- It's relevant as hell,

13:38.368 --> 13:40.371
but I'm not doing anything.

13:40.438 --> 13:42.372
Terry also loved the show.
This is him.

13:42.439 --> 13:44.492
No, no,
I love Elisabeth Moss.

13:44.559 --> 13:46.084
Terry thought the show was too bleak.

13:46.151 --> 13:47.610
Oh, they're coming from everywhere.

13:47.677 --> 13:50.187
Hello. Blessed be the fruit, baby.

13:50.254 --> 13:52.100
- Hitchcock, you watch that show?
- Watch what?

13:52.167 --> 13:53.998
- That's my pickup line.
- What are they doing?

13:54.055 --> 13:55.951
We haven't heard from Charles.
We need to check to make sure

13:56.008 --> 13:58.059
- everything's fine.
- Check what? The server?

13:58.182 --> 14:00.450
I stole the cummerbund from
under there an hour ago.

14:00.654 --> 14:04.128
- You knew about...
- About you playing? The server?

14:04.195 --> 14:05.840
I've known about your plans for weeks.

14:05.898 --> 14:08.159
Uh-oh, they're circling. Stop!

14:08.799 --> 14:10.934
Hello, Ofamy.

14:11.001 --> 14:12.598
Hello.

14:13.671 --> 14:16.246
- I don't know what's going on.
- I do.

14:16.341 --> 14:18.028
Handmaids, out!

14:19.045 --> 14:20.413
They really listen to you.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.274
You figured out I had
the belt in my safe,

14:22.341 --> 14:24.542
and you thought you could
distract me and steal the key.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.082
I did think those things, yes,

14:26.149 --> 14:28.686
and then... I did it.

14:28.753 --> 14:30.554
Please. Impossible.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.824
The key has been in my
shoe the entire time.

14:33.899 --> 14:35.639
Okay, well, it's almost midnight.

14:35.698 --> 14:37.874
Why don't you try and use your key?

14:40.865 --> 14:42.062
It fits.

14:42.129 --> 14:44.131
I knew you were lying.
You are so predictable.

14:44.198 --> 14:45.517
Uh-oh, it's not turning.

14:45.575 --> 14:47.754
I guess I'm not quite as
predictable as you thought.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.707
And I also bet none of you
can predict

14:49.774 --> 14:51.032
what I'm gonna do next.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.346
Use your key to open the safe
and act like a dick about it?

14:53.403 --> 14:54.779
Yes, obviously that's
what I'm gonna do, Rosa.

14:54.836 --> 14:57.114
You just have to be so
spot-on all the time.

14:57.247 --> 14:58.581
If I may... mm...

14:58.676 --> 15:01.105
just get my skirt up, thanks.

15:02.119 --> 15:03.749
Oh, look at that, the key fits.

15:03.816 --> 15:07.545
And the lock is turning,
and the safe is... empty?

15:07.612 --> 15:08.823
- What?
- There's no cummerbund?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.408
- Never was. It was always a belt.
- I don't understand. Who took it?

15:11.465 --> 15:13.474
We haven't heard from Charles in an
hour. Maybe he betrayed The Tramps.

15:13.531 --> 15:15.622
Oh, God, I just called us The
Tramps. What have I become?

15:15.679 --> 15:17.053
It's not Charles. I locked him up.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.022
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I put a
GPS tracker on the belt.

15:20.116 --> 15:21.951
It's on the move,
and it's going fast!

15:22.018 --> 15:23.719
Let's take my bike.
They'll never catch us.

15:23.786 --> 15:26.007
- Later, dorks.
- Should we follow them? I...

15:27.483 --> 15:29.219
Captain, why are you giggling?

15:29.277 --> 15:33.182
I put a GPS tracker inside of Terry.

15:33.240 --> 15:37.445
Sarge, Kevin purchased one too
many full-fat French yogurts.

15:37.547 --> 15:40.742
- You want it?
- Absolutely.

15:41.759 --> 15:43.891
Enjoy, Jeffords. Enjoy.

15:43.949 --> 15:45.703
Devious, I know, but...

15:45.781 --> 15:47.481
I also put a tracker in Terry's yogurt.

15:47.539 --> 15:48.966
Same here. No reason.

15:49.033 --> 15:50.734
Just 'cause you're a great sergeant.

15:51.008 --> 15:52.203
Now suck it down.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.320
Eh, no problem, take it.

15:54.396 --> 15:55.833
Swallow the 'gurt.

15:55.891 --> 15:57.458
Do you guys think all that radiation

15:57.516 --> 15:59.500
- is bad for him?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

15:59.609 --> 16:01.797
- He's lived a long life already.
- Yeah.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.217
Good luck keeping up with me.

16:07.284 --> 16:08.852
I've done my morning calisthenics.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.460
Oh, I'll keep up with you...

16:10.520 --> 16:12.022
Rah!

16:12.097 --> 16:15.700
In hell. Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

16:22.728 --> 16:24.129
- Hello, Jacob.
- Dah!

16:24.368 --> 16:25.658
What... Ames...

16:25.716 --> 16:27.933
What are you doing here? Why aren't
you out looking for the belt?

16:27.990 --> 16:29.998
You and I both know the belt
never left the precinct.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.386
I don't know that. Nobody knows that.

16:31.443 --> 16:33.819
I kept thinking,
"How did anyone swap my key?"

16:33.877 --> 16:37.181
And then it hit me... they didn't.
They swapped the safe.

16:37.248 --> 16:39.827
<i>One of the handmaids,
I'm assuming fake Charles,</i>

16:39.885 --> 16:43.979
<i>took my safe, and then Ofamy
deposited a lookalike.</i>

16:44.166 --> 16:46.082
What did you give fake
Charles so he'd help you?

16:46.149 --> 16:47.843
Nothing.
In fact, he gave me something,

16:47.910 --> 16:49.593
the power of financial freedom.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.128
I invested in a pyramid scheme.

16:51.195 --> 16:52.796
It's no time to go into it right now.

16:52.863 --> 16:54.913
Okay... so, while we
all tried to figure out

16:54.971 --> 16:56.307
who had the real key,

16:56.393 --> 16:58.604
<i>fake Charles broke into the safe,
removed the tracke,</i>

16:58.713 --> 17:00.955
<i>and led Terry and the whole
squad on a wild goose chase.</i>

17:01.057 --> 17:04.260
My only question is,
which box is the belt in?

17:04.338 --> 17:06.221
Well, good luck figuring it out,

17:06.282 --> 17:08.469
because the clock is tick-tick-tocking.

17:08.527 --> 17:09.890
- It's that one.
- No!

17:09.948 --> 17:12.239
The dust pattern on top
doesn't match its neighbors.

17:12.305 --> 17:15.221
You see, Jake, I'm always gonna
be one step ahead of you.

17:15.346 --> 17:17.185
You've lost the ability to surprise me.

17:17.243 --> 17:18.557
Ya just plain boring.

17:18.615 --> 17:21.182
Again, weird take on a
very loving relationship.

17:21.258 --> 17:22.952
And it's midnight,

17:23.010 --> 17:26.396
so I guess I'm an amazing
human/genius.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.999
Yeah. Although...

17:29.362 --> 17:31.562
you might wanna read the
inscription on that there belt.

17:31.698 --> 17:35.038
Why? Oh, no, what does it say?

17:35.268 --> 17:37.932
"Amy Santiago, will you marry me?"

17:40.155 --> 17:41.456
Surprise.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.228
I'm so confused... I don't know
what's happening right now.

17:49.286 --> 17:51.250
"I'm so confused... I don't know
what's happening right now,"

17:51.307 --> 17:54.051
- title of your sex tape.
- "Oh, my God, I'm shaking."

17:54.118 --> 17:56.639
I'm definitely gonna cry,"
Title of your sex tape.

17:56.706 --> 17:59.620
Wait, is this really happening?
Is this part of the heist?

17:59.687 --> 18:02.231
If this is part of the heist,
I will dump you so hard.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.733
No, please, Ames, look,
it's really happening, okay?

18:04.800 --> 18:07.010
It's not part of the heist.
I promise, this is real.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.299
- It is?
- Yeah.

18:10.064 --> 18:12.221
Okay, here it goes.

18:12.415 --> 18:15.218
Ames, I love you.

18:15.411 --> 18:18.613
I love how smart you are.
I love how beautiful you are.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.883
I love your face,
and I love your butt.

18:20.950 --> 18:22.089
I should've written this down first.

18:22.146 --> 18:23.924
No, no, it's okay. Go on.

18:23.987 --> 18:26.432
I love how much you pretend
to like "Die Hard."

18:26.571 --> 18:28.377
- I like the second one.
- You don't have to.

18:28.435 --> 18:29.377
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:29.435 --> 18:31.994
You're kind, and you're funny,

18:32.061 --> 18:33.627
and you're the best person I know,

18:33.685 --> 18:36.554
and the best detective.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.699
Also, for reals, I love your butt.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.754
- I love yours too.
- Gross.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.097
Amy Santiago...

18:46.446 --> 18:47.988
will you marry me?

18:48.480 --> 18:50.979
Jake Peralta, I will marry you.

18:59.783 --> 19:01.351
I love you so much.

19:01.409 --> 19:03.377
Hey, jerkos, this little Tramp escaped,

19:03.435 --> 19:05.089
so that ought to teach...

19:06.004 --> 19:07.800
- D-did you just...
- Mm-hmm.

19:07.921 --> 19:10.056
- And did you say...
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.488
- To Jake and Amy.
- To Jake and Amy!

19:16.596 --> 19:18.145
Great stuff, great stuff.

19:18.297 --> 19:19.614
So, since Peralta
altered the cummerbund,

19:19.671 --> 19:21.379
no one really
won the heist this year.

19:21.598 --> 19:22.973
Is that what everyone's thinking?

19:23.031 --> 19:24.410
- Captain...
- Right, right, sorry.

19:24.468 --> 19:26.449
Not the time.
I'm so happy for you both.

19:26.573 --> 19:28.280
Technically, there was
no winner. Continue.

19:28.338 --> 19:29.168
Hey, Gina just texted me.

19:29.226 --> 19:31.769
She said, "Weird, I didn't even
realize they were dating."

19:31.995 --> 19:34.064
JK, so happy for you bitches."

19:34.123 --> 19:36.418
- Oh.
- So, Jake, tell us everything.

19:36.559 --> 19:39.214
- Did you call Amy's dad first?
- I actually did.

19:39.339 --> 19:41.163
Mr. Santiago,
I'm calling to inform you

19:41.230 --> 19:42.881
that I plan to ask your
daughter to marry me,

19:42.938 --> 19:45.974
but since it's 2017, I am not
asking you for your permission,

19:46.032 --> 19:47.362
as she is not your property,

19:47.420 --> 19:49.472
nor would she be mine,
if she chooses to say yes.

19:49.638 --> 19:52.127
She's a strong independent woman,
and she don't need no man.

19:52.195 --> 19:53.918
That being said,
I truly hope she says yes.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.629
But it's her decision,
so just back off!

19:55.687 --> 19:58.121
Aww, that was perfect.
What did he say?

19:58.179 --> 20:00.675
I have no idea, I left a voicemail.
I'm terrified of him.

20:00.751 --> 20:02.323
Not to talk out of turn,

20:02.381 --> 20:05.754
but I think I get credit for
giving Jake the idea to propose.

20:05.821 --> 20:07.089
- How's that?
- Remember?

20:07.156 --> 20:08.289
That day in the kitchen.

20:08.356 --> 20:09.464
So, what I'm saying is,

20:09.522 --> 20:10.857
vanilla yogurt is good,

20:11.032 --> 20:13.449
but pair it with a blueberry yogurt,

20:13.507 --> 20:15.474
and both of them taste even better.

20:15.617 --> 20:17.886
- Get it?
- Yes?

20:17.965 --> 20:19.047
I did not get it,

20:19.105 --> 20:21.972
but speaking of yogurt, you've
eaten six GPS devices this week.

20:22.030 --> 20:23.090
You should see a doctor.

20:23.148 --> 20:24.222
- What?
- Hm?

20:24.280 --> 20:26.183
Look, Sarge,
I think everyone knows that

20:26.241 --> 20:28.152
I planted the idea in Jake's head

20:28.241 --> 20:30.127
eight years ago.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.972
Oh, hi, I'm starting today.
Detective Santiago.

20:33.030 --> 20:35.666
Oh, Detective Peralta. Welcome aboard.

20:35.933 --> 20:38.550
I'm hearing wedding bells.

20:38.980 --> 20:40.168
Hi, Detective Boyle.

20:40.287 --> 20:42.029
That actually really slowed things down.

20:42.087 --> 20:44.065
It took, like, four years for
me to forget that memory.

20:44.122 --> 20:47.004
- Yeah, I'm my own worst enemy.
- Look, no one gave me the idea.

20:47.074 --> 20:50.496
I decided to ask Amy to marry
me all on my own on April 28th.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.074
There's a typo in
this crossword puzzle.

20:56.981 --> 20:59.066
I don't get it. Seems pretty normal.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.288
I don't know what to tell you.
That's just when I knew.

21:01.355 --> 21:02.744
Romantic epiphanies are dope.

21:02.811 --> 21:04.199
Thank you, Rosa. They are dope.

21:04.257 --> 21:06.066
Yes, dope. Congratulations.

21:06.124 --> 21:07.800
I'm so happy you two
are getting married.

21:07.858 --> 21:10.035
- We're getting married.
- We're getting married!

21:10.263 --> 21:12.932
- And no one won the heist.
- Captain!

21:13.124 --> 21:14.746
Get over it, ya jag!

21:14.804 --> 21:16.173
Yeah, ya jag!
