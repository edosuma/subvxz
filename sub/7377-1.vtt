01:25.500 --> 01:27.000
March 11.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.800
Dear diary,
my husband of 18 years...

01:30.800 --> 01:34.000
this week is being honored
by the city of Atlanta...

01:34.100 --> 01:36.700
as the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.600
I am so proud of him.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.200
He has worked so hard.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.300
I wanna swing

01:53.300 --> 01:56.700
Swing till daylight
with you

01:56.800 --> 01:59.800
I wanna dance

01:59.800 --> 02:02.600
Dance the whole night through

02:02.700 --> 02:05.900
Where the beat-beat-beat
is jumping

02:05.900 --> 02:08.199
And the crowd is feeling fine

02:08.199 --> 02:11.600
Where the dance-dance-dances
are popping

02:11.700 --> 02:14.800
Theirs are flowing like wine

02:14.900 --> 02:18.200
I wanna swing

02:18.300 --> 02:21.000
Swing till daylight with you

02:21.100 --> 02:24.700
I wanna dance...

02:24.700 --> 02:26.400
To look at us...

02:26.500 --> 02:29.300
you would think
that we've got it all together.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.800
But looks can be deceiving.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.800
Some days are good
and I think he loves me.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.800
Then other days...

02:37.900 --> 02:40.300
I think he doesn't care.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.000
Dancing till daylight

02:42.100 --> 02:45.000
Just us two

02:45.100 --> 02:46.700
Kicking up my heels...

02:46.700 --> 02:49.000
I never thought
I'd see this day.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.500
I was just saying
to my wife this morning...

02:51.600 --> 02:54.000
that if I died and came back...

02:54.100 --> 02:56.400
that I would want
to come back as me.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.400
No, truly it is an honor...

03:01.400 --> 03:04.600
to receive the Jacob Frienstein
Attorney of the Year Award.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.800
It's especially
an honor because...

03:06.900 --> 03:09.500
He is so into appearances.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.600
What looks one way
on the outside...

03:11.700 --> 03:14.800
can be a totally different
matter on the inside.

03:14.900 --> 03:19.300
There is no way...
no way...

03:19.400 --> 03:22.600
that I could have done
any of this...

03:22.700 --> 03:26.100
without my wonderful wife
of 18 years.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.500
I don't know this stranger
I sit next to.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.300
All I know is that with
every dime and every case...

03:45.400 --> 03:47.900
he has changed.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.300
How about l...
run us a hot bath?

04:06.300 --> 04:07.800
I left something at the office.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.200
I have to go.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.500
Who is she?

04:13.500 --> 04:17.700
When you get a job
and pay one of these bills...

04:17.700 --> 04:20.300
then you can ask me questions.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.100
I am still your wife.

04:24.100 --> 04:26.100
That's cute.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.500
Charles...
I don't want to fight.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.100
This is your night.
Let's just enjoy it.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.500
Tell me what I need to do,
and I will do it.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.300
You really want to know
what you ought to do?

04:48.700 --> 04:51.100
Get the hell out of my car.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.200
What a way
to start our anniversary.

05:44.300 --> 05:49.300
Tell me...why do I love
that man so much?

05:49.400 --> 05:51.300
Maybe if I could stop
thinking about...

05:51.400 --> 05:53.300
how good things used to be...

05:53.400 --> 05:56.400
I might be able to find
the strength to leave.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.300
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.600
Hi, Mrs. McCarter.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.000
Hey, Mrs. McCarter.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.900
Kalvin, how are you?
How is Joanne?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.900
-She's doing great.
-That's great.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.300
-You doing all right?
-I'm wonderful. Thank you.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.200
Listen, is he in?
Because I brought him, uh...

06:29.300 --> 06:30.300
lunch.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.200
Actually, I'm headed that way--

06:32.300 --> 06:36.000
No, no. Please.
Thank you, though. Thank you.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
Helen.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.800
What, um...

06:43.900 --> 06:48.100
Um...hi.
I'm Brenda Marcos.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.900
How do you do?

06:51.100 --> 06:53.500
Um...we got to go.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.200
You ready, little fella?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.500
It was nice to meet you.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.100
Is that her?

07:04.700 --> 07:06.900
Don't play games with me.
Tell me, Charles.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.500
Is that her?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Thank you.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.300
I'll see you at home.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.300
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

07:42.400 --> 07:43.500
What?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.300
-What are you doing?
-Working.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.600
Where are you going
with my things?

07:48.700 --> 07:52.800
Lady, look...I'm just filling in
for my cousin because he's sick.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.300
Somebody named Charles McCarter
or something like that...

07:55.400 --> 07:57.500
rented this truck,
told me to load it up and wait.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.800
So that's what I'm doing.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.800
No. Wait. Wait.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.300
Christina?

08:10.400 --> 08:11.900
Christina.
Christina, there--

08:12.000 --> 08:15.400
there is a man out there
putting my things in a truck.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.900
What is going on?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.900
Mr. McCarter asked me to pack
all your things this morning.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.300
And all these clothes
are from the boutique.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.700
I wish I had a man to do
something like this for me.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.900
Happy anniversary.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.100
-I have something to tell you.
-Your gift first.

09:09.700 --> 09:13.400
Aren't you going to open it?
Charles, I have to admit...

09:13.500 --> 09:16.500
I thought you forgot,
but I saw all the clothes...

09:16.600 --> 09:20.100
in the closet
and...ta-da! Ha ha!

09:20.200 --> 09:23.100
It's not exactly my taste,
but I love it.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.400
Helen--

09:24.400 --> 09:26.300
This one, it doesn't really
fit quite right, though.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.100
I think I'm going to have
to get some alterations--

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Helen.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.100
You see how I keep
interrupting you?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.300
Charles, I only want
to hear the good tonight.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.000
OK?

09:41.700 --> 09:45.600
I need to tell you something.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.400
What is she doing here?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.300
I asked her to come.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.200
Charles, what is going on?

09:53.300 --> 09:55.700
Is she wearing the dress
that I just picked out?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.500
What?!

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
There's no easy way
to say this...

09:59.500 --> 10:01.600
but our marriage
has run its course.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.400
It's over.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.500
What? What are you
trying to say?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.500
I'm saying...
it's over.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.700
Charles!

10:08.800 --> 10:11.000
Helen,
don't act so surprised.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.300
I mean, I haven't
touched you in a year.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.800
I haven't...well...

10:14.900 --> 10:16.900
I haven't been happy for years.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
18 years, and you think
you can just come in here...

10:19.100 --> 10:20.300
and end it like this?

10:20.400 --> 10:24.600
Charles, what am I supposed
to do without you?

10:24.700 --> 10:26.500
You're a bright girl.
You'll figure it out.

10:30.100 --> 10:33.800
Charles...please.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
-Oh, my God.
-Don't do this.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.300
Please tell me you're not one of
those weak begging sisters.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.600
Brenda, let me handle this.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.600
You are not leaving.

10:48.700 --> 10:53.000
No...I'm not leaving.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.500
But you are.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.500
There's a truck outside.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.200
It's full of gas,
and I hired some guy...

10:58.200 --> 11:00.000
to take you
anywhere you want to go.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.100
I can't keep treating her
like this. And my children...

11:02.200 --> 11:03.800
not seeing their daddy
every night.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.100
I'm staying here and there--

11:09.400 --> 11:11.500
Children?

11:11.600 --> 11:14.000
Two boys. They need me.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.500
Charles.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.700
It's me.
How can you say this to me?

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
How can you do this to me?

11:24.700 --> 11:28.800
Good-bye, Helen. Now,
be a lady and leave quietly.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
-No.
-No?

11:30.700 --> 11:32.800
You would've never had
any of this without me.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.500
Now, you better
get up out of here...

11:34.500 --> 11:38.000
-before I lose my temper.
-No!

11:38.000 --> 11:39.400
No, I am not leaving!

11:39.500 --> 11:43.000
-You what?
-No!

11:43.100 --> 11:45.000
You're leaving, all right.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.900
You're leaving. Go on.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.700
Any way you want to do it.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.900
Get up! Get up!

11:53.900 --> 11:57.200
Aah! No! Charles! No!

12:04.700 --> 12:06.500
Come on.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.600
Huh? Come on.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.800
What you doin'?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.400
Get out of here! Get out!

12:17.500 --> 12:20.100
Charles! Charles!

12:21.700 --> 12:23.200
Charles!

12:53.400 --> 12:56.900
Oh, what the hell
have they got me into?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.600
Hey, look...

13:08.700 --> 13:10.900
we've been driving
around for hours now.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.900
I do have another job that
I have to be at in a few hours.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.800
So there's got to be
someplace I can take you.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.600
Take me where?

13:19.600 --> 13:24.500
He has alienated me
from my entire family.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.300
He made me put my mother
in a home bec--

13:30.000 --> 13:34.900
Because she didn't fit
into his "American dream."

13:36.400 --> 13:39.500
I don't have anyplace to go.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.300
Lady, I'm really sorry
to hear about that...

13:41.400 --> 13:42.700
but it's the middle
of the night--

13:42.700 --> 13:45.800
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm trying to help you out.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.100
-Just stop the truck!
-I'm not stopping the truck.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.500
All you men are just alike!
You just think about yourselves!

13:50.600 --> 13:52.300
You don't think about
anybody else but yourself!

13:52.400 --> 13:54.200
Just stop the truck,
and I will drive myself...

13:54.200 --> 13:55.800
where I have to!
Pull the truck over!

13:55.900 --> 13:58.900
Hey! Don't grab the wheel!
Hey. Don't touch the wheel.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.400
I'm stopping. I'm stopping.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.800
-Then get out!
-We're in the middle of nowhere.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.400
I don't care!
Get out of the car!

14:04.500 --> 14:05.900
I'll drive myself!

14:05.900 --> 14:07.600
You know what? Now I see
why you're going through...

14:07.700 --> 14:09.300
what you're going through.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.800
Oh, you go to hell!

14:10.900 --> 14:12.600
Have a nice life.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.300
Yeah, you're welcome!

15:17.800 --> 15:19.100
Don't shoot! It's Helen...

15:19.200 --> 15:20.500
your granddaughter!
Don't shoot!

15:20.500 --> 15:21.800
What the hell? Girl!

15:21.900 --> 15:24.200
I always open the door
this time of night shooting...

15:24.300 --> 15:25.800
'cause there ain't nothing
but a crackhead...

15:25.900 --> 15:27.700
or the police knocking
on your door this time of night.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.000
What you doing here this late?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.900
I was in the neighborhood and--

15:35.000 --> 15:36.800
You were in the neighborhood?

15:36.900 --> 15:38.100
I thought I'd come by
and say hi.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.000
You live in a mansion
on the other side of town.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.000
What the hell you doing
in the ghetto?

15:43.100 --> 15:44.800
You ain't on that stuff, is you?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.500
Is you over here trying
to buy some stuff?

15:46.600 --> 15:48.800
I missed you.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.000
Come by in the daylight here.
Don't come by--

15:51.000 --> 15:54.400
Madea, please.

15:54.500 --> 15:57.200
Come on in here.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.500
Who that is at the door?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.800
Shut up, Joe. I got this.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.800
...I'm gonna have
to put my foot down.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.600
Kunta Kinte put his foot down,
and it got chopped off.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.200
Now shut the hell up
and go back to sleep.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.100
I know I had some
cigarettes in this--

16:33.200 --> 16:34.300
Harpo.

16:34.400 --> 16:38.600
Harpo, who this woman?

16:38.700 --> 16:40.500
Joe, go in that room
and take your medicine.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.400
You know you crazy as hell
when you don't take it.

16:42.500 --> 16:46.100
I say hell...no.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.400
What the hell?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.500
Look what you
done made me do!

16:53.600 --> 16:54.900
Oh, hell!

16:54.900 --> 16:56.800
Get the hell up.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.000
You didn't come by yesterday.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.000
You got to eat something
out there on them streets.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.500
You got to be careful,
you hear?

17:04.500 --> 17:08.200
Look at you. Lord help me.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.900
You ain't got
no regular clothes, do you?

17:10.900 --> 17:11.900
What?

17:11.900 --> 17:14.000
Helen...hey.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.099
Debrah?

17:18.200 --> 17:21.300
Yeah, girl.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.300
You gonna hug me?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.800
Yeah.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.600
So, how are you doing?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.200
You look good. You look good.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.700
Marrying that rich lawyer.

17:39.700 --> 17:43.000
When we were kids, we both said
we'd get a rich man, right?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.400
We both got lawyers.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.900
Deb, what--
what's going on?

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
Don't. Don't do that.
Don't judge me.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.700
Thank you. I got to go.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.000
You take care of yourself
out there.

18:01.700 --> 18:02.900
Lord.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.600
You hungry?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.400
I can't eat anything.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.800
You need to eat something.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.000
What happened to her?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.100
Life.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.400
Brian and the kids must
really be going through it.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.900
They're doing all right.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.700
But I want to talk about you.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.400
I called Charles this morning...

18:23.500 --> 18:26.000
and he told me,
before he hung up...

18:26.100 --> 18:28.500
that you and him
is getting a divorce.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.100
But what I can't seem
to figure out is why you here.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.000
He put me out of the house.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.100
-Who house?
-Our house.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.500
Exactly. How the hell
a man gonna put a woman...

18:38.600 --> 18:40.400
out of her own house?
He might've put me out...

18:40.500 --> 18:41.800
but he was gonna
put me out of half.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.300
I'm gonna go in
the other half of the house.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.800
He wasn't puttin' me
out of all of it.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.500
The house is in his name, Madea.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.100
Lord have mercy.
That's how women get messed up.

18:49.200 --> 18:53.300
Too busy out shopping when you
need to be checking the deed.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.800
Whoo! That makes me mad, girl.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.200
I don't have any rights
to the money.

18:57.300 --> 18:58.600
No right?

18:59.900 --> 19:01.400
I signed a prenup.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.300
What the hell
you sign a prenup--

19:04.400 --> 19:06.400
I ought to punch you
in the face.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.100
Who the hell told you
to sign a renup?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.500
He didn't have nothin'
when you married him!

19:10.500 --> 19:12.300
Charles always knew
he'd be successful.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.600
And he said to me...

19:13.600 --> 19:15.800
"l want to know that
you're here for love."

19:15.800 --> 19:17.900
And I didn't have a job.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.400
So it's his money.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.700
Is it? What was you doing
while he was working, honey?

19:22.700 --> 19:25.800
Taking care of the house,
cooking and cleaning.

19:25.800 --> 19:29.300
Exactly.
That sounds like a job to me.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.000
Cooking and cleaning--
how long you do that?

19:31.100 --> 19:33.700
18 years.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.800
All right. OK.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.300
18 years...

19:38.400 --> 19:41.300
let's see how much he owes you.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.600
18 years...

19:44.700 --> 19:47.000
you've been cooking...

19:47.000 --> 19:48.800
cleaning...

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
having sex with him
when he wanted.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.800
-Was it good?
-No.

19:55.900 --> 19:58.600
Major deduction.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.100
And I didn't tell you
that he hit me.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.700
Girl, that man
owes you 64 billion...

20:20.700 --> 20:23.000
283 million, 974 trillion...

20:23.100 --> 20:24.700
5 thousand...

20:24.800 --> 20:28.100
and 20 dollars and 82 cents.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.800
Now, you need to get your money.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.900
-That'll never happen.
-You want to bet?

20:33.000 --> 20:34.700
I can happen
one of two ways, honey.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.800
You can get it from his
checking account voluntarily...

20:37.900 --> 20:39.400
or his insurance policy.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.100
Involuntary manslaughter.
Which one it's gonna be?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.400
-Madea.
-Mm-mm.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.400
I ain't gonna have this.
Come on.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.400
-What? Where are we going?
-To your house.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.400
Oh, no. The guard
will never let us in.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.300
I said come on!

20:58.500 --> 21:00.100
Mayday! Mayday!

21:09.400 --> 21:11.200
Lord have mercy.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.300
Get your stuff.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.000
What the hell
is wrong with you?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.500
These your clothes?

21:17.600 --> 21:18.800
They're hers.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.700
Oh, they're hers?

21:20.700 --> 21:24.600
Who is, uh...
"Dol...say & Gab-anna?"

21:24.700 --> 21:25.700
Who that is?

21:25.800 --> 21:29.300
Dolce and Gabbana.
They're designers.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.200
Oh. She a label ho.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.300
$700 for a damn rag?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.300
Just a rag.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.800
Madea, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.200
This man left you...

21:46.300 --> 21:48.900
for some old floozy.

21:52.400 --> 21:54.400
Madea, what's wrong?

21:58.400 --> 22:03.400
A wire hanger!

22:09.000 --> 22:10.500
Rip it.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.800
Rip it?

22:11.900 --> 22:13.100
-Rip it.
-No, no.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.800
Rip it!

22:14.800 --> 22:16.700
-Rip it? Rip it!
-Rip it!

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
Rip it!

22:17.900 --> 22:19.100
Rip it!

22:20.700 --> 22:23.200
What the hell are you doing?

22:24.500 --> 22:27.900
Rip it like this!
Get mad at it!

22:28.000 --> 22:31.200
It'll make you feel better!
Rip it!

22:31.300 --> 22:33.900
Rip it! Rip it!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Rip something!

22:35.100 --> 22:37.100
-Rip it!
-Rip it!

22:37.100 --> 22:38.700
Rip it real good. Rip it.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.300
Wait a minute.
What's this gonna solve?

22:41.400 --> 22:44.900
Nothing. It's just gonna
make you feel better.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.200
-Rip it! Ha ha ha!
-Rip it!

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
This is for every black woman...

23:00.100 --> 23:03.200
who ever had a problem
with a black man!

23:13.300 --> 23:14.400
Goodness.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.400
Calm down, girl.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.600
I'm tired as hell.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.100
OK.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
I'm gonna go down
to the office.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.200
I forgot some things.

23:28.300 --> 23:33.500
OK...you go down
in the office...

23:33.600 --> 23:35.600
because you forgot something.

23:35.700 --> 23:38.800
Find me some oxygen.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.700
And bring me some oxygen!

24:20.400 --> 24:23.300
What are you doing in here?

24:23.300 --> 24:24.900
Charles.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.800
Are you stealing from me?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.800
No. No, I just--

24:28.900 --> 24:32.300
How did you get in here?
I changed the locks.

24:37.300 --> 24:40.200
What the--who are you?

24:40.200 --> 24:41.800
Who are you?

24:41.800 --> 24:43.500
I'm the owner of this house.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.200
Wrong answer.
My granddaughter Helen...

24:45.300 --> 24:47.200
is the owner of this house.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.800
You're the ho. You ain't
got no power or no deed.

24:49.900 --> 24:52.100
Did you do this?
This is Vera Wang!

24:52.200 --> 24:55.300
Who that is? She do nails?
I need to get my nails did.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.500
That's it!
I'm calling the police!

24:57.500 --> 25:00.300
I'm not scared of no popo.
Call the popo, ho.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.600
Call the popo, ho!

25:02.700 --> 25:05.200
Charles, please...

25:05.300 --> 25:07.900
I don't have any money, and--

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I tried to be nice to you,
didn't l?

25:11.900 --> 25:15.200
Didn't l?

25:15.200 --> 25:16.900
I'll just go.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.500
You'll just go?

25:21.700 --> 25:23.600
I'll just take it,
and I'll just go.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.600
Oh, you'll just
take it and go, huh?

25:25.700 --> 25:28.300
You're gonna take
my money and go?!

25:28.400 --> 25:30.600
If I call the police, they're
gonna be here in ten minutes.

25:30.600 --> 25:34.300
OK. Then that leaves me nine
to beat the hell out of you.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.800
You think?
I know tae kwon do.

25:36.900 --> 25:39.800
And I know whoop your ass.
Come on. Bring it on.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.900
You don't know me.
I'm from the projects.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.900
Come on.
What the hell is your problem?

25:45.000 --> 25:46.500
Come on. Shut up. Shut up!

25:48.000 --> 25:49.800
Oh, hell no. Watch out.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.200
Yeah, you keep running!

25:51.300 --> 25:52.900
What?
Now you asking me questions?!

25:53.000 --> 25:54.300
You begging now?

25:54.400 --> 25:56.300
Oh, please do it.
Please hit her.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.500
Please!
I want to see you do it.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.900
What the hell's wrong with you?

25:59.900 --> 26:01.700
Here, now, you bastard.
Put your hands on her.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.500
Oh, my God! Don't hurt him!

26:03.600 --> 26:05.100
Oh, I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm gonna kill him.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.500
Putting his hand
on my granddaughter.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.200
I'm calling the police.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
You call the police, so they can
see how you done hit her.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.300
No, just get out.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.800
Charles, I have been nothing but
a good woman and wife to you.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.800
I don't deserve this.

26:16.900 --> 26:20.600
You will reap what you sow.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.600
Keep your money.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.400
You crazy as hell.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.500
Just leave it.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.300
I might leave some of it.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.900
It was this that made you
the evil bastard that you are.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.100
Get out.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.500
Here, now, the way I see it...

26:35.600 --> 26:37.100
half of everything in this house
belongs to her...

26:37.100 --> 26:38.600
and I ain't leaving here
till she get it.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.000
-She'll never see it.
-What did he say?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.600
Come on, Madea. Let's go.

26:42.700 --> 26:43.900
That's right. Go.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.800
Give me 5 minutes with her
in the bathroom, please.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.500
Madea, let's go.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.900
OK. Oh, yeah. I'm leaving.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.000
It's just a matter of time...

26:59.100 --> 27:00.700
before he does
the same thing to you.

27:00.700 --> 27:03.400
Never. I could never be you.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.400
I'm a woman who knows
how to get and keep her man!

27:08.300 --> 27:10.100
What's that?

27:10.200 --> 27:11.400
Madea...

27:11.500 --> 27:13.100
Half of everything
in here belongs to her.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.000
Which half do you want?
Do you want this half...

27:15.100 --> 27:16.800
or do you want this half?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.800
Madea.

28:02.400 --> 28:05.400
Your Honor,
case number 456790--

28:05.500 --> 28:09.200
the People versus Mabel Simmons
and Helen McCarter.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
Criminal trespassing,
reckless endangerment...

28:11.700 --> 28:13.100
criminal possession
of a handgun...

28:13.200 --> 28:14.500
assault with a deadly weapon...

28:14.600 --> 28:17.500
What are you
walking so fast for?

28:17.500 --> 28:19.500
Suspended license,
expired registration...

28:19.600 --> 28:23.500
reckless driving,
and a broken taillight.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.300
Girl, I know that ain't
who I think it is.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.800
I know you didn't say
Mabel Simmons. Madea?

28:29.900 --> 28:31.900
How are you doing,
Judge Mablean?

28:31.900 --> 28:35.000
It's good to see you.
Your hair is pretty, girl.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.700
Look at you.
You're looking good.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.400
How you been?

28:38.400 --> 28:39.700
You're still at it?

28:39.800 --> 28:41.200
This ain't even my fault.
What had happened was--

28:41.300 --> 28:44.000
Save it.
Who's here for the defense?

28:44.100 --> 28:45.700
Brian Simmons here on behalf...

28:45.700 --> 28:47.600
of Mrs. McCarter and
Mrs. Simmons, your Honor.

28:47.700 --> 28:49.900
-Brian?
-How you doing, Judge Ephriam?

28:49.900 --> 28:52.500
I'm getting tired
of seeing your aunt.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.800
I'm tired of seeing you.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
It won't happen again.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.600
Yeah, I bet.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.200
Bail is set at $5,000
for Miss McCarter...

29:02.300 --> 29:05.400
property or cash.
But as for you, Madea...

29:05.500 --> 29:08.000
I'm placing you
under house arrest.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.800
You ain't putting me
on no house arrest, honey.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.100
I ain't fi'n
to to deal with that.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.700
It's either that or prison.
What's your choice?

29:13.800 --> 29:15.400
I'll take the house arrest.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.900
Bailiff, call the next case.

29:17.900 --> 29:21.800
The city of Atlanta
versus Bobby Brown.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.400
What is this,
repeat-offender day?

29:23.500 --> 29:27.100
Bobby! Bobby, I love you!
Sit down, Miss Houston.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.800
-OK, you like hot sauce?
-Put that lid down!

29:47.500 --> 29:50.000
What the hell?
How the hell you do that?

29:50.100 --> 29:51.800
You don't know
what we're playing?

29:54.200 --> 29:55.500
Hey, Daddy.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.200
I see you got Thelma and Louise
out of jail.

29:59.300 --> 30:00.900
Yeah, I did. Hey, stop running.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.300
Stop running.
Say hi to your aunt Helen.

30:03.400 --> 30:04.800
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.000
That's your son. Tiffany.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.400
-My God. How old is she now?
-She'll be twelve tomorrow.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.900
Hey, baby. How you doing?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.700
-Can l?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.300
So...

30:17.400 --> 30:19.900
I saw Debrah.

30:22.800 --> 30:25.600
I didn't know she was so bad.

30:25.600 --> 30:31.200
Yeah. She took it pretty hard
when you left.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.100
Charles wanted us
to move away from anything...

30:34.100 --> 30:38.300
that reminded him of the past,
and why I let him do that...

30:38.400 --> 30:40.900
Debrah and I were thick
as thieves growing up, huh?

30:41.000 --> 30:43.700
Yeah, you were.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.000
I'll tell you what.
Y'all about to be set.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.700
What you got? Oh, hell.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.700
Y'all don't know nothing
about playing no cards.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.200
I'm gonna take mine and git.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.900
I could have spent my money
in a better place.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.200
Did you hear me, John?

30:54.200 --> 30:57.600
We gonna play, or we gonna talk?

31:00.300 --> 31:03.000
Joe, let me get some.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.100
That's some good stuff.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.500
You want some, John?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.000
I guess not.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.800
Joe, let me get some.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.000
Last time we gave you
some of this stuff, Mildred...

31:17.100 --> 31:18.700
we had to call the popo on you.

31:18.700 --> 31:19.900
We had to call the ambulance
and everything.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.300
You went crazy as hell.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.400
You ain't supposed to smoke this
when you're on lithium.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.000
I'm all right.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.400
All right. Don't wet up my butt,
get the lipstick all over it.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.800
You act crazy if you want to.
Whose play is it?

31:30.900 --> 31:32.000
Play something.
Play something.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.700
Brian, can you handle
my divorce?

31:35.700 --> 31:37.400
You don't even have to ask.

31:39.100 --> 31:42.800
I always thought that
if I did all I could...

31:42.900 --> 31:44.900
God would bless my marriage.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.700
It takes a lot more
than you doing all you can.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.200
And who's to say that
this is not your blessing?

31:50.300 --> 31:51.900
You know, sometimes
we hold onto the things...

31:51.900 --> 31:53.600
that God himself
is trying to tear away.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.900
It's not that easy.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.700
You know women. We love hard.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.200
-And men don't?
-Not like a woman.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.900
I don't know
if I agree with that.

32:00.900 --> 32:02.300
We don't love as easy...

32:02.400 --> 32:04.000
but when we love,
we love just as hard.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.700
You don't see men
getting themselves...

32:05.800 --> 32:08.100
in situations like mine.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.000
The mother of my kids
is a junkie...

32:12.700 --> 32:14.600
and I love her.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.800
That's a tough situation.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
Yeah. I look at Tiff--

32:19.200 --> 32:22.600
she is so much like her.
She wants to sing.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.200
I can't let her do that.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.800
She's not Debrah.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.300
Tell that to my heart.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.400
Orlando. O-dawg,
what's going on, man?

32:34.500 --> 32:37.100
Big Brian, what's up, man?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.800
Y'all got it smelling
real right around here.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.300
That's my deal, man.
That's my deal.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.100
Hey, I want to introduce
you to somebody.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.300
This is my cousin Helen.
Helen, this is Orlando.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.400
Did I miss something?
You two know each other?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.200
This is the sweet young lady...

32:51.300 --> 32:53.400
that threw me out
of a moving truck.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.000
This is the crazy woman--

32:56.000 --> 32:57.400
That's her.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.000
This town is too small.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.400
I think you owe me an apology.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.200
I don't owe you anything.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.400
I was just trying
to help you out the other night.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.400
Oh, yeah, right.
You're no good Samaritan.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.100
He paid it. It's not like
you're some savior or something.

33:09.200 --> 33:12.800
I'm gonna go...
check--do something.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.300
Just another bitter
black woman, huh?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.300
Excuse me?

33:19.400 --> 33:22.800
I called you bitter, because
now every man you meet...

33:22.900 --> 33:24.800
is gonna have to pay
for what he did.

33:24.900 --> 33:26.400
You don't know
anything about me.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
I know I watched a man
drag you out of a house...

33:28.600 --> 33:30.000
and treat you like dirt.

33:30.100 --> 33:33.800
Now there's another story
you can tell my cousin.

33:33.900 --> 33:36.500
And I'm not bitter.
I'm mad as hell!

33:41.500 --> 33:44.000
Turn that off up there.
Turn it off.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.700
Shut up up there, all that
music.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.200
How you doing, Henry Lee?

33:49.200 --> 33:50.700
It's good to see y'all.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.300
See, I'm on house arrest.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.700
What is that?

33:53.700 --> 33:55.200
You don't even
want to know, baby.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.700
You don't even want to know.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.600
Get somewhere and sit down
over there, little boy...

33:58.700 --> 34:01.000
before I knock the hell
out of you. Where's your mama?

34:01.100 --> 34:03.000
There you go.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.699
-Mildred, you all right?
-Mm-hmm.

34:08.699 --> 34:11.100
Mildred, don't you start
acting crazy.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.400
Give me, give me. Here.
I'm gonna put this out.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.100
You acting like you crazy.
I'll save that for later.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.800
Your play, Mildred.

34:22.100 --> 34:23.100
Play something.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.199
Help! Somebody help me!

34:33.300 --> 34:35.100
I'm out.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.500
What happened to my eyes?

34:36.600 --> 34:37.900
Everything is dark!

34:38.000 --> 34:40.400
Open your eyes, and you might
be able to see something, fool.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.300
Crawling all over me!
The rabbits!

34:42.300 --> 34:45.199
The rabbits
are crawling all over me!

34:45.300 --> 34:47.800
You ain't supposed to be
smoking that stuff, Mildred.

34:47.900 --> 34:49.000
Rabbits!

34:50.300 --> 34:51.800
Brian, please take her home
to her house.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.199
I don't know why the hell
you come over here...

34:53.300 --> 34:54.300
to my yard with that.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.800
Get on, rabbit. Go, rabbit.

34:55.900 --> 34:59.700
Go. Go, rabbit. Go.
OK, the rabbit's gone. OK?

35:00.900 --> 35:02.300
All right. No more rabbits.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.900
Hey, Mildred,
you forgot your rabbit.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.800
Don't come back over here
no more, Mildred!

35:10.900 --> 35:12.300
Don't come back over here!

35:12.400 --> 35:13.500
I don't see no rabbit.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.200
That was good stuff we had.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.200
Is that a rab--
that's a rabbit!

35:22.700 --> 35:25.400
Here. Use this.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.500
What's this,
your way of apologizing?

35:27.600 --> 35:30.600
Because if it is,
I'm not accepting it.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.800
I'm sorry, mister.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.900
Hey, hey.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.500
My name's Orlando.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.800
Orlando.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.000
Willie, put some music on.
Something we can dance to.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.800
You got it.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.800
Let's turn this party up.
Y'all, come on. Dance.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.400
Come on. Everybody come on.
Come on, Helen.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.900
You and that young man.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.700
Come on, young man. Come on.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.600
March 19.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.300
Dear diary...

36:25.400 --> 36:28.800
I look out at my family
having fun and laughing...

36:28.900 --> 36:32.100
and everything in me
is screaming for help.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.500
How do I get to that place?

36:35.600 --> 36:38.600
How?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.600
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

36:48.600 --> 36:50.700
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

36:50.800 --> 36:53.700
Go, Joe! Go, Joe!

37:02.700 --> 37:04.000
Hello?

37:04.100 --> 37:06.200
Chuck, this is Jamison.
Man, I need to talk to you.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.600
You know what time it is?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.100
I don't really care
what time it is.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.400
I got a situation.
We need to talk now.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.600
It went bad.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.100
What are you talking about?

37:20.200 --> 37:21.600
-I shot him.
-Who?

37:21.700 --> 37:24.000
Some cop undercover
who was trying to sting me.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.800
What does that
got to do with me?

37:25.800 --> 37:27.600
Charles,
I need a lawyer and a judge.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.100
Now, there is $300,000
in that bag.

37:30.100 --> 37:31.900
That ought to
buy me both, right?

37:32.000 --> 37:34.500
Look, I'm a legitimate
defense attorney...

37:34.500 --> 37:37.700
and I would advise you
not to try and bribe a judge.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.300
Look, man, I'm hot!

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
I don't have time for
all this legal stuff, man.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.600
OK, look, you know I don't deal
with your kind anymore.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.000
My kind? Brother,
before you started...

37:47.100 --> 37:48.700
defending all
these rich white boys...

37:48.800 --> 37:50.600
it was my kind
that got you down.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.300
-I'm going home.
-Home?

37:52.400 --> 37:54.600
Oh, how quickly we forget.

37:54.700 --> 37:57.100
I ran so much coke
for you back in the day...

37:57.200 --> 37:58.700
I paid for that house.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.100
Now look here. I need you,
like you needed me...

38:04.100 --> 38:06.700
back in the day
to get all you got.

38:06.700 --> 38:09.400
No. What you need
is a lawyer...

38:09.500 --> 38:11.800
and not to ever
call my house again.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.000
You are my lawyer.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.300
You know where to find me.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.300
Lord Jesus. All of this
calamity in the world.

38:44.300 --> 38:48.100
But I tell--

38:48.200 --> 38:51.300
The paper's sad.
It's really sad.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.400
You nasty as hell.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.300
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.800
Here.

38:58.900 --> 38:59.800
What?

38:59.900 --> 39:01.300
You need a job.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.600
Oh, Madea, I don't--

39:03.700 --> 39:05.400
I don't know
how to do anything.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.100
I got a job for you...

39:07.200 --> 39:09.500
as soon as I get
some more Vaseline.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.300
Joe, that is your--
that's your family.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.100
That's your dead husband's
side of the family.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.100
She ain't no kin to me.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.300
I could introduce you to Harvey.
Maybe he'll help you out.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.700
She ain't selling no dope, Joe.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
If I had a bottle
of battery acid...

39:24.800 --> 39:27.000
I would give you
a chemical peel...

39:27.100 --> 39:29.700
just scrub all of that ugly
off of your face.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.300
I know you're my brother...

39:32.400 --> 39:34.800
and the only reason I'm
letting you stay in my house...

39:34.900 --> 39:36.500
is to get your check.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.400
But I can still
get your check...

39:38.500 --> 39:39.900
if you come up missing.
Keep trying me.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.500
But you're gonna end up
in the Chattahoochee river.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.800
What you looking at?!

39:44.900 --> 39:46.500
You ain't moving in here.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.300
Next thing you know,
she'll be getting mail here.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.300
Joe, leave that baby alone.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.900
If their name
comes on the envelope...

39:52.000 --> 39:53.500
that means they move
right the hell in.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.000
Get out.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.400
Get--get out.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.000
Baby, take that newspaper...

40:00.100 --> 40:02.400
and go on in the kitchen
and look for you a job.

40:02.500 --> 40:03.800
And an apartment.

40:03.900 --> 40:06.100
Look for an apartment
while you're in there.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.800
You always messing
with somebody.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.500
What the hell's wrong with you?

40:09.600 --> 40:11.100
You're just grouchy as hell.
You been grouchy.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.300
That's why Mommy and Daddy
didn't like you.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.500
She ain't moving in here.

40:15.600 --> 40:17.800
Ain't enough room in this house
for all of us here.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.800
This ain't "Roots." These rooms
are barely big enough...

40:20.900 --> 40:22.300
for you to turn around in.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.200
Man, but you know,
you're just huge.

40:24.200 --> 40:27.300
You big as a Buick.
You just fat as hell.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.100
I watched you walk
down the hall the other day.

40:29.100 --> 40:31.300
I thought somebody had put
a refrigerator on your butt.

40:31.300 --> 40:32.800
You're huge. You're big.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.000
And that's something
you'll never...

40:35.000 --> 40:37.700
in your life hear a woman say.

41:14.100 --> 41:15.500
Yes!

42:05.400 --> 42:07.000
Thank you, Mrs. McCarter.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.700
She's in her room.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.100
Hi, Mama.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.800
Hi.

42:51.300 --> 42:54.000
I brought you some things.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.500
Hey, baby. How you doing?

43:01.600 --> 43:05.200
Oh. I'm doing OK.

43:06.700 --> 43:08.100
Yeah.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.800
They talked to me
about the bill here yesterday.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.200
They call you?

43:15.300 --> 43:17.500
Yes.

43:17.500 --> 43:19.900
I'm gonna get that paid.

43:19.900 --> 43:22.100
You know Charles
don't care nothing about me.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.400
What makes you think
he's gonna pay it?

43:24.500 --> 43:26.900
I talked to Madea.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.300
I know what's going on.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.300
I think I'm...

43:35.300 --> 43:37.100
losing my mind, Mama.

43:38.800 --> 43:41.200
He hurt me so bad.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.200
He was my everything.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.300
God is your everything.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.700
Don't you know
he's a jealous god?

43:52.700 --> 43:55.500
He don't want no man before him.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.800
I don't even know
where to begin...

43:59.900 --> 44:02.000
to pick up the pieces
of my life.

44:02.100 --> 44:03.600
Lord have mercy.

44:05.400 --> 44:09.300
I was 39 years old
when you were born.

44:09.400 --> 44:13.100
I never ever dreamed
I'd have children.

44:13.200 --> 44:15.800
And then here you come...

44:15.900 --> 44:17.900
sweet bundle of joy.

44:19.800 --> 44:22.200
But what did I do?

44:24.400 --> 44:27.800
I think I shielded you
way too much.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.600
Now you got to get out there...

44:31.700 --> 44:34.700
try to stand
on your own two feet.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.600
Oh, no, Mama.

44:36.700 --> 44:39.300
I can't do that.
I'm not strong like you.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.300
Sure you are.

44:41.400 --> 44:47.300
You got the strength
God gave us women to survive.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.100
You just ain't
tapped into it yet.

44:55.700 --> 44:57.000
Come here.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.300
Come on.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.800
Come on now.

45:03.900 --> 45:07.500
Oh...

45:10.400 --> 45:12.800
just let it go.

45:12.900 --> 45:16.800
Nothing wrong with
shedding a few tears.

45:16.900 --> 45:19.000
It cleanses the soul.

45:19.100 --> 45:25.000
You know, you need
to stop thinking...

45:25.000 --> 45:27.800
about what you think
you lost...

45:27.900 --> 45:30.800
and look forward
to what there is to gain.

45:30.900 --> 45:32.800
It's a new life, baby.

45:32.900 --> 45:35.700
It's right in front of you.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.800
All you got to do
is reach out and grab it.

45:40.400 --> 45:44.900
How do I do that, Mama? How?

45:48.200 --> 45:50.300
By waking up every morning...

45:50.300 --> 45:53.300
and thanking God that you did.

45:53.400 --> 45:57.300
And then ask him to help you.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.600
Just ask the savior to help you.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.500
April 18.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.400
Dear diary,
every day I wake up...

46:20.500 --> 46:24.000
I take my mother's advice.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
Most days, I don't want
to get out of bed...

46:27.000 --> 46:29.300
but I do.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.500
Some people say,
"One day at a time."

46:32.600 --> 46:35.300
Seems too long for me.

46:35.400 --> 46:39.100
Most days, all I can do
is moment to moment.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.300
The good thing
about being this low...

46:41.400 --> 46:46.500
is that there's
nowhere to go but up.

46:47.900 --> 46:50.000
Hi. Can I get your order?

46:50.100 --> 46:51.100
Hi.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.800
OK, I'm gonna kill Brian.
Did he tell you I work here?

46:55.900 --> 46:57.300
Hey, easy. Easy.

46:57.400 --> 46:59.800
A man's got to eat, right?

46:59.900 --> 47:02.000
What can I get for you?

47:02.000 --> 47:05.100
How about a coffee
and a number four?

47:05.200 --> 47:08.300
We don't have number fours
in this restaurant.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.700
OK. How about just a coffee?

47:10.700 --> 47:13.100
Coffee.

47:13.100 --> 47:15.000
OK.

47:16.300 --> 47:18.300
I like the new haircut...

47:18.400 --> 47:20.700
a lot.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.800
Thank you.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.500
Oh, no matter what

47:34.500 --> 47:37.100
You may be going through

47:37.200 --> 47:39.100
Take it to the master

47:39.200 --> 47:41.500
He'll see you right on through

47:41.500 --> 47:43.800
I know Jesus, whoo!

47:43.900 --> 47:45.500
Take it to him

47:45.600 --> 47:48.600
You can leave it there

47:48.700 --> 47:51.100
He will work it out

47:51.200 --> 47:53.500
No matter what

47:53.600 --> 47:56.800
You may be going through...

47:56.900 --> 47:58.500
April 25.

47:58.600 --> 48:03.000
Dear diary,
today was a bad day.

48:03.100 --> 48:06.900
I got up and came to church
because I was so angry.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.900
When I think
about all the blood...

48:09.000 --> 48:10.900
and sweat and tears
I put into my marriage...

48:11.000 --> 48:12.900
it makes me want to hate him.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.700
Let me tell you something, boss.

48:14.800 --> 48:18.600
I paid you a lot of money,
and that judge, he ain't down.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.100
The judge had no choice...

48:20.200 --> 48:21.900
but to allow the videotape
into evidence.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.100
I told you
to make this go away.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.400
Say it wasn't me,
I wasn't there.

48:26.500 --> 48:29.100
How the hell do you
use self-defense?

48:29.200 --> 48:30.600
You're on videotape.

48:30.700 --> 48:32.100
And it will be
very hard to explain...

48:32.200 --> 48:34.000
you not being there
at the time of the murder.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.600
Self-defense is our only option.

48:35.700 --> 48:37.800
Then put me on the stand.
I'll say it wasn't me.

48:37.900 --> 48:39.500
Then all your priors
come into play.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.700
Look, Mr. Jackson,
you have to let me work here.

48:42.700 --> 48:45.100
Look, man, you can get me off,
make this go away.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.700
Look, I said
I would do all I can.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.800
Well, that better be
a hell of a lot, brother.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.300
Or I will do all I can.

48:50.400 --> 48:51.800
Wait a minute.
Are you threatening--

48:51.900 --> 48:53.800
Ain't nobody talking to you.

48:53.900 --> 48:56.800
I done paid you a lot of money.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.500
You know how it is
on the streets, Chuck.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.800
Brother don't do what he say.

49:01.900 --> 49:05.800
However you and your homeys
settle your disputes...

49:05.800 --> 49:08.300
this has to play out in court.

49:08.300 --> 49:11.300
-If I go down, man--
-If you go down?

49:11.300 --> 49:13.300
Kalvin, walk away.

49:13.300 --> 49:14.800
Walk away.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.300
Don't let this suit fool you.

49:24.300 --> 49:28.300
I don't take too kindly
to threats, Mr. Jackson.

49:28.300 --> 49:32.800
And I don't make
idle threats, Mr. McCarter.

49:32.900 --> 49:35.500
I better get off.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.300
May 12.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.100
Dear diary...

49:49.800 --> 49:52.100
I'm beginning to find my way.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.600
It's been close to
three months...

49:54.700 --> 49:58.300
and every day
gets a little easier.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.600
Even though we're still
battling Charles in court...

50:00.700 --> 50:04.600
I don't even give it
that much energy anymore.

50:04.600 --> 50:07.100
I don't understand this,
but it's strange...

50:07.100 --> 50:10.000
how little can be so much
when you're happy.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.700
I find myself
smiling and laughing...

50:13.800 --> 50:16.000
more than I ever have.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.600
I find myself...

50:18.600 --> 50:23.100
Wait a minute. That's it.

50:23.200 --> 50:25.300
I'm finding myself.

50:31.700 --> 50:35.100
It's nights like this
I wish I had a car...

50:35.200 --> 50:38.000
or kept that U-Haul truck
a few more days.

50:56.000 --> 50:59.500
Hey. Brian asked me
to pick you up tonight.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.000
He did?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.100
No, thanks.

51:04.200 --> 51:05.500
All right, but you know...

51:05.500 --> 51:07.700
the next bus doesn't come
for at least an hour.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.100
I'll be fine.

51:11.200 --> 51:13.900
Why are you being
so mean, woman?

51:13.900 --> 51:17.100
Why are you being
so nice, man?

51:17.200 --> 51:20.600
You know, there are still
a few of us nice guys around.

51:20.700 --> 51:23.000
All right. Suit yourself.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.400
Come on, now.
This makes no sense.

51:26.400 --> 51:29.200
You'll take me straight home?

51:29.300 --> 51:31.000
I'll take you wherever
you want to go.

51:31.100 --> 51:33.100
Just get in the truck.

51:33.100 --> 51:34.200
Come on.

51:39.700 --> 51:41.400
You all right?

51:41.500 --> 51:42.600
Yeah.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.500
This is some weather, huh?

52:03.800 --> 52:06.000
Hey, you know what?
I'm kind of hungry.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.700
You want to stop
and have some dinner?

52:08.800 --> 52:10.400
I have food at home.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.300
I was thinking you might like...

52:13.400 --> 52:15.500
a nice little salmon dinner
at one of my favorite spots.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.600
Where is that? McDonald's?

52:17.700 --> 52:21.300
Actually, it's a little
jazz bar called Chandra's.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.100
I love that place.

52:26.100 --> 52:29.100
There you go. All right. So?

52:29.100 --> 52:30.500
Are we going?

52:30.500 --> 52:34.600
-I can't afford Chandra's.
-No, no, no, no. I got it.

52:34.700 --> 52:36.000
You got it?

52:36.100 --> 52:37.700
Yeah, I got it.

52:37.800 --> 52:39.900
And what do you do?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.100
Because I don't hang
with drug dealers.

52:42.200 --> 52:46.300
I work twelve hours a day
at McWorth steel, all right?

52:47.700 --> 52:49.100
I got the bill.

52:49.100 --> 52:52.400
Yeah. Well, this is not a date.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.500
Yes, ma'am.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.700
What are you looking at?

53:31.100 --> 53:33.300
A beautiful black woman.

53:34.500 --> 53:37.600
Is that all you see
when you look at me?

53:37.600 --> 53:40.300
No. No, not at all.

53:41.700 --> 53:45.100
I also see a woman
who's been hurt...

53:45.200 --> 53:46.700
a lot...

53:46.800 --> 53:50.200
and she's taught herself
how to be tough...

53:50.300 --> 53:52.200
real tough.

53:52.300 --> 53:56.300
But, you know, the key
is to be tough, not hard.

53:56.300 --> 54:00.100
And how would you know
what the key is?

54:01.700 --> 54:04.500
Let's just say
I had to learn it, too.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.400
Is that what you tell
all your women?

54:11.400 --> 54:13.700
I don't have women.

54:16.500 --> 54:20.100
I had a bad breakup last year.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.600
And I guess
you could say I've...

54:24.600 --> 54:27.600
I've been happily single
ever since.

54:30.300 --> 54:33.400
Well, I guess...

54:33.400 --> 54:36.100
we've both had
bad breakups, then.

54:36.100 --> 54:38.900
Hello. Welcome to Chandra's.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.800
I'm Chandra Currelley.

54:43.800 --> 54:46.300
This one is
for the new couples...

54:46.400 --> 54:48.700
here for the very first time
tonight.

54:52.200 --> 54:56.000
How do I start?

54:58.800 --> 55:03.700
Where do I begin?

55:03.800 --> 55:08.400
I've been hurt so much

55:08.400 --> 55:12.400
I just need a friend

55:12.400 --> 55:16.200
Could it be you?

55:16.200 --> 55:22.100
Will you break
through these walls?

55:22.200 --> 55:24.300
Are you willing

55:24.400 --> 55:28.000
To help them fall?

55:28.100 --> 55:34.800
I want to love again...

55:37.600 --> 55:39.400
So, what did you do?

55:41.100 --> 55:42.400
What?

55:42.500 --> 55:44.600
Well, men always do something.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.900
Did her looks change?

55:47.900 --> 55:49.900
Did you grow tired of her?

55:49.900 --> 55:51.100
No.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.700
She decided she wanted
a pro ball player.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.200
He had a lot more money
than I had.

56:01.700 --> 56:03.600
I'm sorry.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.400
It's not a big deal.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.400
...with you

56:11.800 --> 56:15.000
You don't know that

56:15.100 --> 56:16.800
These...

56:16.800 --> 56:19.200
Dance with me.

56:20.800 --> 56:22.500
No. I'm in my uniform.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.300
So what? Who cares?
Look at me. Come on.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
No, no, no.

56:25.500 --> 56:30.900
Is driving me crazy

56:31.000 --> 56:35.900
Oh, my mind,
my mind says no

56:36.000 --> 56:41.200
But my body says yes

56:41.300 --> 56:42.700
You're...

56:42.800 --> 56:44.900
Dear diary...

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
this man is fine.

56:49.100 --> 56:53.200
How does he know
I like to be held like this?

56:53.300 --> 56:54.900
Am I holding you too tight?

56:55.000 --> 56:58.400
Lord knows, I wanted to say,
"Yes. Back the hell up."

56:58.500 --> 57:02.300
But he felt so good.

57:02.300 --> 57:04.700
It's OK.

57:04.800 --> 57:07.700
Dear Jesus,
please let this man let me go...

57:07.800 --> 57:09.700
before I lose my mind.

57:12.500 --> 57:15.600
And he smells so good.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.000
What's the catch?

57:18.100 --> 57:20.000
Please let him
say something stupid...

57:20.100 --> 57:21.900
like all men do at this time.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.200
You know,
this feels like a fairy tale.

57:25.300 --> 57:27.500
No, he didn't!

57:27.600 --> 57:30.000
That was the right thing.

57:30.100 --> 57:33.400
What do you mean?

57:33.400 --> 57:36.700
Just me holding you like this.

57:39.100 --> 57:43.100
I used to believe
in fairy tales, but...

57:43.100 --> 57:45.600
I don't anymore.

57:45.600 --> 57:50.000
And I'll, I'll do the rest

57:50.100 --> 57:53.900
Your every smile,
your gentle touch

57:53.900 --> 57:57.400
I've...

57:57.400 --> 58:00.100
never been this close
to any man...

58:00.100 --> 58:05.000
other than my husband--
my ex-husband.

58:06.900 --> 58:10.200
Charles--that's his name.

58:12.900 --> 58:17.200
He was supposed
to be my fairy tale.

58:17.300 --> 58:20.400
He was my first...

58:20.400 --> 58:22.600
and my only.

58:42.100 --> 58:44.000
Here it is.

58:44.100 --> 58:45.500
Thank you.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.000
You're welcome.

58:47.100 --> 58:49.100
You know,
I'd like to see you again...

58:49.100 --> 58:50.600
if that's all right.

58:57.100 --> 58:59.700
Orlando, I'm just getting
out of a relationship and--

58:59.800 --> 59:05.100
You know, it's so easy to say no
sometimes out of fear.

59:05.100 --> 59:07.900
So how about just taking
the hard road...

59:07.900 --> 59:10.100
and saying yes?

59:10.200 --> 59:12.400
Just this one time.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.900
I mean, what's so wrong
about being friends?

59:19.500 --> 59:21.700
Nothing, I guess.

59:21.800 --> 59:25.400
Yeah. Nothing.

59:25.400 --> 59:28.600
So, I'll see you tomorrow?

59:31.600 --> 59:34.500
So, you're asking me out again?

59:36.300 --> 59:38.900
This wasn't a date, remember?

59:45.200 --> 59:48.100
-OK, I'll see you tomorrow.
-There you go.

59:48.100 --> 59:49.700
I'll see you tomorrow.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.600
-You got it?
-I'm trapped.

59:53.700 --> 59:55.700
It's old-school. I got it.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.100
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-OK.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:07.300
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.700
When you're finished,
you need to leave.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.200
Leave?
I don't have nowhere to go.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.900
What do you want me to do?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.800
Open the house up to you?
Give you the keys?

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.500
You put me and these
kids through enough.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.100
You need to go.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.600
You still have that picture.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:14.400
What happened to us?

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.800
You.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.400
I don't want to do this
anymore, Brian.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.800
Help me, please.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.800
No. Every time
I try to help you...

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.000
you disappoint me.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.900
This time,
you got to help yourself.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.400
But I can't.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:42.000
God knows how many times
we've been through this.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.700
You say that every time,
and I wake up...

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.800
the next morning,
my wallet is gone.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.500
No, but I'm serious
this time, Brian.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.800
Come on, please.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.400
I can make you feel good.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.600
Don't you want to feel good?

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
It's time to go.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.600
I really am trying.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.100
Damn thing working
on my nerves.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.700
You know, I was watching
the Animal Planet channel...

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.800
and they say that
when a coyote is trapped...

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.600
it will eat its own foots off
to get out of the trap.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.100
You want some hot sauce?

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.500
In your case,
it wouldn't be a coyote.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.000
It would be a elephant!

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.900
A big old giraffe!

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.400
A big old giraffe!

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.400
Say one more thing, Joe.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.700
Say one more thing.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:31.300
I don't hear you. You're quiet.
Can I buy a vowel?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.500
It's open!

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.900
Come on, Tiffany.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.400
Hey. Got to drop the kids off
because I got to go to court.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.600
My cigarettes.

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.600
How you doing? You all right?

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.000
Hey there, little boy.
What's going on?

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.800
How you doing?
Good to see you, B.J.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.300
What's wrong with you?

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:56.600
She wants to sing
in that church choir.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.000
You can join in at twelve.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.000
Go on in there and watch TV.
Let me talk to your daddy.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.700
Madea, I don't want to hear it.
She's not singing in that choir.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.900
Roll your eyes at me,
get slapped.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.600
Brian, just because singing
led Debrah to drugs...

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.300
don't mean the same thing is
gonna happen to your daughter.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.700
And why you put Debrah out of
the house the other night?

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.400
You need to try to help her.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.800
Hell, no! Don't do that.
That is stupid!

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.200
I've done all I can, Madea.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.600
You right. You right.
Let me tell you something...

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.000
what I learned.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.000
You can't turn no whore
into no housewife.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I'm telling him.
I tried it with your mama.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.500
Whoo, that was terrible.
Come on. Let's go out there.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.800
Madea, I can't keep putting
these kids through this, OK?

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.200
Brian, you is using them
children like a crutch.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.900
You understand
what I'm telling you?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.100
Any fool could see you love
that woman with all your might.

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.800
You need to help her.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.800
And at the same time,
it might help you.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.800
Don't do it! Don't do it!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.600
Don't do it, I say!

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:59.700
Don't do it!

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.300
Listen, you take your daughter
on down there...

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.400
and let her sing
in that church choir.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.400
That is constructive,
what she's doing.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.600
She need to do
something constructive.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.500
Love is stronger
than any addiction, baby.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.100
Hell, it is one.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.700
You got time to eat?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.500
August 30.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.000
Dear diary...

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.700
some random thoughts for you.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:31.000
Orlando and I have been out
every night since Chandra's.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:34.700
That was almost four months.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.300
I keep waiting
for him to change...

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.100
to be this evil person...

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.900
but it hasn't happened.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:45.700
I didn't know a man
could be so thoughtful.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.800
It's like second nature.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.100
What?

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.000
I'm just sitting here
trying to think of a way...

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.300
to say this to you.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
I'm in love with you.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.400
How do you know that?

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:26.300
I don't know
how to explain it to you.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.800
Try.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.800
Helen, if I'm away from you
for more than an hour...

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.100
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.600
I carry you in my spirit.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.800
I pray for you more
than I pray for myself.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.300
I got it so bad for you,
I'd go to the grocery store...

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.400
and I'd buy your feminine
products. I swear I would.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.300
See? And that. That.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.700
That smile.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.500
Helen, when you smile
like that...

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:13.100
my world...
it's all right.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.600
I am in love with you.

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:36.200
Dear diary,
when did I get here?

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.899
Somewhere,
out of all the pain...

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:42.000
came a man who is strong...

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.600
beautiful, sensitive...

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.100
and Christian.

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:51.399
Last night was so amazing.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.200
Even though we both wanted
to make love...

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:57.399
he chose to give me
something better.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.100
He gave me intimacy.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.100
I haven't felt this way in...

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.899
well...never.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.300
You know, what's strange
is that I thank Charles...

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:18.200
because if he hadn't been
such a terrible man to me...

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.700
I wouldn't know
what a good one feels like.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.200
He can have it all.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.700
Your Honor, may I have a moment
to confer with my client?

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.899
It's fine.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.600
It's fine.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.600
Your Honor, let him
have it all...everything.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.399
Are you sure?

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.600
Yes...

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.000
as long as he agrees
to pay my attorney's fees...

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.400
and my mother's stay
in a nursing home...

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:56.000
he can have it.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.700
So ordered. Mr. McCarter
will retain ownership...

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.300
of all said properties solely,
and no alimony is ordered.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.800
Mr. McCarter will pay all
Mrs. McCarter's attorney fees.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.700
Divorce will be granted...

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.200
upon the signature of
both parties after thirty days.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.600
Adjourned.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.700
Do you have any idea
what you just did?

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.100
Yes.

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.000
Smart choice.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.600
Later, Charles.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.600
Smart choice.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.300
Will the defendant please rise?

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.400
Mr. Foreman, has the jury
reached a unanimous verdict?

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.300
We have, your Honor.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.400
What say you?

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.100
We, the jury,
find the defendant...

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:32.400
Jamison Milton Jackson,
guilty.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Quiet. Quiet.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:37.300
Quiet.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.800
I'd like to thank the members
of the jury for their duties.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.100
Take him away.

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.700
Sentencing will be
in three weeks.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.400
This court is adjourned.

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.200
Good looking out.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.800
Somebody get an ambulance!

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.200
Hurry! We need
an ambulance, please!

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.300
Will someone get some help?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.800
Do you love me?

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:37.600
Hey.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.400
Hey. Hey.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:47.100
Helen, my heart says
that you do.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.400
Your actions say that you do.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.100
But you've never said it.

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.600
The last man that I said--

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.500
No, no, no, no.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.400
Please...

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.700
don't make me pay
for his mistakes.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.000
If you love me, just say it...

01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.100
and you trust me
with that information...

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.100
because I promise you
I won't abuse it.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.100
But I need to hear it.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.800
Yes...

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.800
I love you.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.000
Now what?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.900
That's it. That's it.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.400
You just trust it.

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.100
OK?

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.600
Any time you want
to give in to that fear...

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.800
you let our love outweigh it.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.200
Right?

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.000
-Yeah?
-OK.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:14.900
Good morning.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.800
Orlando, what's going--

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:10.600
I know you don't believe
in fairy tales.

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.300
But if you did...

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:20.500
I'd want to be your knight
in shining armor.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.800
You've been through so much.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:31.000
I don't want
to see you hurt anymore.

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.800
Now, I may not be able to give
you all that you're used to.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.300
But I do know I can love you
past your pain.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.600
I don't want you
to worry about anything.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.000
You just wake up
in the morning.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.700
That's all you have to do,
and I'll take it from there.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.600
There's one condition.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.100
You have to be my wife.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.700
Say something.

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.800
What? What's wrong?

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.400
-Oh, my God.
-What?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.300
What's wrong?

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.800
-What?
-I have to go.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.200
Go? Go where?

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300
I'm sorry.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.700
-Where are you going?
-I have to go.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.700
We removed two
of the four bullets...

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.000
but there's one that's
very close to the spine.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:18.500
There's a great possibility...

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.000
he could be
permanently paralyzed.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.400
Are you his wife?

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.700
I am soon to be.
He won't be able to walk?

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.000
It's touch-and-go
at this point.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.500
We're trying
to stabilize him...

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.900
so we can perform
this last surgery...

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:30.200
but this bullet
is in a very difficult place.

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.700
I need to know,
if things go badly...

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.200
should we resuscitate?

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:35.400
What do you mean,
"If things go bad"?

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:38.900
I have to be honest with you.
It doesn't look good in there.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Should we resuscitate?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
No.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:43.700
-Wait a minute.
-Excuse me?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.500
I'm sorry. These decisions
are usually left to the spouse.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.100
No, no, no.
Legally, she is still his wife.

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.700
Then you have to make the call.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.300
You do everything
you can for him.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.200
You are so vindictive!

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.800
What quality of life is that man
gonna have if he can't walk?

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:10.100
Did you not hear her
say "possibility"?

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.600
Why are you here?

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.000
Helen, calm down.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:16.600
Why are you here?!

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.000
Let me go.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.200
OK.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.300
I'm fine.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.200
September 1.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.500
Dear diary, tell me,
why am I here?

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.000
I know it's the Christian
thing to do...

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:47.100
but my flesh wants to beat
the hell out of him.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.600
I want to hate him...

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.100
but as I look at him...

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.800
all I feel is sympathy.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.000
Charles?

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400
Hi.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.700
Hi.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.700
He came through pretty well.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.400
He can't speak,
but he can hear you.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:24.500
What about the paralysis?

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.000
Mr. McCarter,
it's Dr. Shiloh.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:31.000
If you can feel this,
I want you to blink your eyes.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.500
Don't get discouraged.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.100
It's not as bad as we thought.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.900
He is breathing on his own.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.500
He's suffered a lot of scarring
and swelling...

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.600
around the nerves
of the spine...

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.200
but as the swelling goes down...

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:59.600
it's possible that he will
be able to regain some feeling.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.300
Don't give up.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.700
September 19.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.800
Dear diary...

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:11.400
as I sit here thinking about...

01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:15.700
picking up the pieces
of what used to be my life...

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.700
I realized something.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:23.500
Every room in this house
holds a painful memory for me.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.200
Even though he's suffering...

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:29.100
something somewhere in me
wants him to suffer more.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:31.000
A few months and a divorce...

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.900
can take you through
just as many emotions...

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.100
as 18 years in a marriage.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.300
And I'm starting to feel
all of them at once.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:45.100
But the one that is clear
is rage.

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.700
Signed, a mad black woman.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.400
I don't see it.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.400
-You don't see it?
-No.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.100
You ain't good for nothing.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.700
Find my bank statement and get
the accountant on the phone.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.200
Then call Kalvin
and tell him...

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:07.800
to get over here,
and you could leave.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.900
This is not gonna beat me.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:12.900
What you starin' at?

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.500
All of this,
and you're still the same.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.200
I'm Charles McCarter.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.200
I'm gonna die Charles McCarter.

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:21.200
Look, I don't even know
why you're here.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.300
I ain't giving you a dime.
Call Brenda and get my kids.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.500
Where are my kids?
Look, just get the hell out.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.600
I ask you to do
one little thing...

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:33.400
and you can't even do that
after 18 years?

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.600
Get out!

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.900
Let me explain something to you.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.500
Old Helen is gone...

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.600
and you will not
talk to me like that.

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:13.900
Now, I came here
to help you...

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.200
but now...

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:19.000
I'm gonna get even.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.600
-Helen, you--
-Shut up!

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.100
You want Brenda and your kids?

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.000
Do you see what you left me for?

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:34.700
This is what you left me for!

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.800
She didn't give a damn
about you, Charles.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.600
She told them to let you die.

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:43.900
I was your wife. I loved you.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.100
I never would have hurt you!

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:48.700
Why did you do this to me?

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:51.400
To us?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.100
Answer me!

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:03.000
And you know what's funny?

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:05.700
I gave you life...

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.600
even though
you took it from me.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.300
Your kids...

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.100
your boys...

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:22.600
I wanted children, Charles!

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:25.000
And had you not been
with those whores...

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.200
we would have them.

01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:30.400
Got me all stressed out--

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.200
my hair falling out,
my weight up and down...

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:36.200
can't keep anything down,
two miscarriages!

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:38.500
You took life from me...

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.600
and you never even said,
"I'm sorry."

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.100
I'm gonna let you sit here
for a few days...

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.600
and think about what I've said.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.700
You stink.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.600
Helen, what you doing?

01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.500
Hey! Stop it! Stop it!

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.400
Hey, stop!

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.200
"Bathe him, feed him...

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.100
"clothe him," they say.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:50.500
What about me?

01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:57.000
What about me?

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.800
Oh, stop making those bubbles.

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.200
You kicked me
out of our house!

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:22.200
You tried to keep me
from our money!

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.700
No.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.700
I was there...

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.300
when all we had was each other.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:18.200
Helen.

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.500
Are you hungry?

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:27.700
Maybe you should
go into the kitchen...

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:31.100
and get yourself
something to eat then.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.200
Christina.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.700
Christina?

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.100
Christina's gone.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.700
Your little tramp didn't leave
any money to pay her...

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:51.100
so she left,
just like your little slut.

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.700
She packed all her things--
and some of yours--

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.500
and left.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.800
Come to think of it...

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.500
she cleaned out
your bank account...

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.800
all of it.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:09.900
You tried to keep it from me,
and she took it all.

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.600
Lord have mercy.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:30.400
Charles,
you are like so many men.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.900
You'd rather leave with trash...

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:38.200
than make it work
with a good woman.

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.600
You're a coward.

01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.400
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.500
Hi.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:23.200
I thought you were
gonna stand me up.

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.600
No.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.100
Can I get a cranberry juice,
please?

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.500
Helen, I haven't heard
from you in three weeks.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.400
What's going on?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.100
I have a lot of things
going on right now, Orlando...

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.200
and I don't think
I can complicate it.

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:50.400
Complicate it?

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.600
I'm a complication?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.600
Thank you.

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:02.400
My husband's back home.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.600
We're back together.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.700
Helen, don't you do this.

01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.900
That man did everything
in his power...

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.100
to try and break you,
but you made it.

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.400
You found strength
and passion for life...

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.500
you never had before.
Why would you turn back?

01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:24.900
Why?

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.800
You can't answer me, can you?

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:38.000
Well, I know the answer,
because I was just like you.

01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.800
Every time things
were going good...

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:41.600
I would always find a way
to mess it up.

01:29:41.700 --> 01:29:45.000
I would sabotage,
just like you're doing.

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:47.000
But, Helen,
I learned that I do deserve...

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.000
to have good things
and a good life.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.100
And I deserve you.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.500
Helen, look at me.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.700
Look at me.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.800
You're a good woman,
and you deserve me.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.400
You want out of that life.
I know you do.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:10.000
The only reason
you're going back to it...

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.600
is because you are still afraid.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.600
I'm right here.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.600
Helen, I love you.

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.400
But I need you to trust me.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.900
I'm sorry, Orlando.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.900
Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.600
What? What? Don't what?
Don't what? What? What?

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:45.600
What do you want from me?

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:47.800
What? Am I supposed to say,
"Let's be friends"?

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:50.400
-ls that what you want?
-Yes.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.200
You don't get it, do you?

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.100
See, when you
really love someone...

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.100
you can't just be their friend.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.900
I don't want to lose you.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.500
And I don't want
just half of you.

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.600
What's that on the dog's leg?

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.700
It's a flea and tick thing.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.800
A flea and...

01:31:13.900 --> 01:31:15.000
Mm-hmm. Come on.

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.000
That don't look like
no flea and tick thing to me.

01:31:18.100 --> 01:31:19.800
That looks very strange.
What is it?

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.700
Madea, we're here!

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.700
Madea. Madea.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:26.900
What's that on the dog's leg?

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.800
Lord, Myrtle Jean, look at you.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.700
You're looking good, girl!

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.200
I just come from church.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.600
Go ahead on, honey.
You look good.

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:34.900
When you coming to church?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.300
I'll be there as soon as
you get a smokers section.

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:39.000
I'm gonna be right there.

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:40.300
Yeah, you look good,
Myrtle Jean.

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.400
You look real good.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.200
How are you doing, Joe?

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.300
I'm good. Come here, baby.
Come here.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.000
Come here.

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.400
Come here.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.100
I got Viagra.

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.300
Come here, baby.

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:57.600
I got Mace.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.500
You're just as mean as a snake,
Myrtle Jean.

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:04.400
You're mean as a snake.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.200
Listen, next Sunday I'm cooking
a big old dinner...

01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.000
and I want all of y'all
to come by here.

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.300
Helen,
have you called Orlando?

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.900
That boy been calling here...

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.700
and coming by here
like he's crazy.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.300
Who's Orlando?

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.100
Her boyfriend.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.600
My friend.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600
And yes, I did talk to him.

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.400
Baby, don't you
open that door...

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:24.700
before you've closed
the other one. You hear me?

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.400
Myrtle Jean, can I get you
to open the door for me?

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:31.300
Knock, knock. Open wide.

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:34.300
Shut up, you old fool.
That all sounds real good...

01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.300
sitting there telling your mom
he ain't nothing but a friend.

01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.700
But I don't know
if I believe that, honey.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.400
There's something
going on between y'all...

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.400
the way you've been
walking around here...

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:46.200
just smiling and grinning
all the time.

01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.100
Mm-mm. I'm too busy
taking care of Charles.

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.800
I don't have time for Orlando.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.800
You're better than me...

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.000
because I would be beating
the hell out of Charles, honey.

01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.300
Yeah, like that man
in "Misery."

01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.500
That woman took that board...

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.400
and she put it
on his ankle bone...

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.400
and she broke
both his foots off.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.000
They went just like this.
Both his foots went like this.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.900
Broke both of them. That's
exactly what I'll be doing--

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.100
breaking something.

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.300
I'll tell you,
I learned a long time ago...

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.800
that God could take care of
folks far better than you can.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.400
God takes too long sometimes.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.300
I need them
to get got right then.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.400
That's why I don't worry
about folks.

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:22.900
They can't make me happy,
and they can't make me sad.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.200
What did the pastor say?

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.900
You know I don't know.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.400
I'd be trying to read
that Bible...

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.800
or go to church or something
and sit there...

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:32.000
and I looked down at that
New Testimony and saw Jesus--

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.800
you know,
the one with the words in red.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.700
I look down and saw
all that red the other night.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.600
I said, "l can't sit here
and read all of this."

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:39.500
Jesus was talking too much
for me to read all of that.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.200
Ain't that the truth?
It seems like every time...

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.700
you open up the Bible,
you gets--

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:46.100
any time anybody
opens a Bible, I just fall--

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.800
I'm just playing.

01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:54.100
You looking just like Beyonce.

01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.300
Sexy thing.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.400
Peace. Be still.
That's what he said.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.000
Peace. Be still.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.400
You know what? Peace is
always still around me...

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:05.900
'cause I keeps me
what they call a piece of steel.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:07.900
As long as you've got
a piece of steel...

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.400
you're gonna have peace.

01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.600
Load your steel.
Thank you, Jesus.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.200
You're not reading
the right part.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.000
Look here. That all sounds
real good and everything...

01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:17.500
talking about
the "peace, be still"...

01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.000
and the Bible
and all that stuff.

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:20.600
But you got to be careful...

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:23.600
'cause I remember
this man did me wrong...

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600
honey, I didn't even know
how mad I was...

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.400
till I got to his funeral.
He had died.

01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:30.700
-Why were you so mad at him?
-Because he hit me.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.900
Yes, he did. He hit me.
And he is eight feet under.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.100
Six feet under. That's where
they bury folks--six feet.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.400
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.700
I thought I was over
what the man had done to me...

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.600
till I saw him
laying in that casket.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600
The man was dead,
and I got mad all over again.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:47.100
I beat him down two more feet.
I was mad as hell.

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.300
Listen, you think
you're over something...

01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.500
you think you're ready
to get on with your life.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:54.400
This is how you really find out
if you're over something or not.

01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.400
If you get an opportunity
to get even...

01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:59.000
with somebody who did you wrong
and you don't take it...

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.800
then you're over it,
but if you don't...

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.700
and you beat the hell
out of them...

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.300
you ain't over it yet.

01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:07.600
Baby, tell me something.
How are y'all doing?

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.000
I'll tell you how she's doing.

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.000
She's beating
the hell out of him.

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:12.400
How did you know?

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.400
Child, you've been around me.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.200
I know something
done rubbed off on you.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.100
You haven't hurt him, have you?

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.700
Just his feelings.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.400
You know, I know this man
put a hurting on you, baby...

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.600
but you got to forgive him.

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:32.100
No matter what he done,
you got to forgive him--

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.900
not for him, but for you.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.000
Forgive him for me?

01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:41.100
When somebody hurts you...

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.400
they take power over you.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:48.000
You don't forgive them,
they keeps the power.

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.000
Forgive him, baby.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:53.900
And after you forgive him,
forgive yourself.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.800
Forgive me.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:59.600
-For what?
-This.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.300
Oh, lord have mercy. You know,
you just don't have no couth.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.800
That's what's wrong with you.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.200
John, $35,000 is not enough...

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.200
for me to take to my client.
I'm on the phone, sweetheart.

01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.700
No. No way. You talk
to your client and--

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.000
Stop! Stop the car!

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.600
Stop! That's Mom!

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.000
I'll call you back, John.

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.500
I'll call you back.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.700
Can I go talk to her, Dad?
Please?

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.000
Dad! Can I go talk to her?

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.700
Go on.

01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.400
Hey, Mama.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:54.100
Tiffany. Hey, girl.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.700
Mom...Dad let me sing
in the church choir.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.000
That's good, baby.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.200
And I wish you would come.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.400
You know I ain't got
nothing to wear.

01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.000
Well, the service
starts at 10:00...

01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:29.000
if you want to come.

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.100
Tiffany.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.900
-Bye, Mama.
-Bye.

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.600
I can feel on my right side.

01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:02.300
Are you going somewhere?

01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.100
Actually, I was waiting on you.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.700
What do you want?

01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:09.500
I don't have anyone.

01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.700
Everybody who I thought
was my friend...

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.300
has turned their back on me,
and it hurts.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.600
But not nearly as much
as what I've done to you.

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:28.200
You are a good woman, Helen...

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:30.200
and a good person.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.800
So...don't be like me.

01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:37.000
You always used to tell me...

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
"God has the power...

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.900
"to show you who's God."

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.600
I get it.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.300
Even though
I almost destroyed it...

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.000
I know you still have a heart.

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:03.000
For everything...

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.100
everything...

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.700
that I have ever
done wrong to you...

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:15.300
I'm sorry.

01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:22.000
I...

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:24.900
am so...

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.100
sorry.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.600
See, what I love about God...

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.100
is that when he asks
a question...

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.700
he already knows the answer.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.800
He asked Ezekiel,
"Can these bones live?"

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:40.300
He asked the lame man,
"Will thy be made whole?"

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:42.300
Somebody's been made whole
up in here today.

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.900
Come on and give him
some praise.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.200
He asked Abraham...

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.400
"ls there anything
too hard for God?"

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.700
God is asking you
that question right now.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:51.600
Is there anything
too hard for God?

01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:54.700
Is there anything
too hard for him?

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:56.400
What will you
believe God for today?

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.400
God can deliver you
out of any addiction...

01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.800
situation, or anything
that you dislike.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.400
Come on, somebody.

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.400
What will you believe God for?
Come on, choir.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.700
The doors of the church
are open.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.100
Come on.

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.500
Come on and bless his name.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.500
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.100
Father, can you hear me?

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.600
We need your love today

01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:32.100
I know that you are listening

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:37.100
You hear them every day

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:40.200
Father, please hear us

01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:44.600
And we will be OK

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.200
Father, we need you

01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:52.100
To live and lead us today

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.500
Father, can you hear me?

01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:58.700
I'm calling on your name

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:00.300
Yes.

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:02.600
Not Buddha nor Muhammad

01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:06.700
But it's Jesus, we cry out loud

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.200
Father, just forgive us

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.200
Hear us when we say

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.400
We'll give you, give you,
give you everything

01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:23.100
Our lives and souls today

01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.200
God, you know we need it

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:30.300
I've never seen so much pain

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.900
We have the faith for now

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:38.100
Your victory we will gain

01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.700
Father, you know we need it

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.100
Hallelujah.

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:45.100
There's no more heart of stone

01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:49.500
We're ready for your power

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.800
Now the sin is gone

01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:56.800
Oh, father, can you hear me now?

01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:58.700
Father

01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.800
Can you hear me now?

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:02.400
Father

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:04.700
Can you hear me now?

01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.700
Father

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:15.100
We will sing, sing a song

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:17.000
Sing a song

01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:21.400
Just say you will, Jesus

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:22.800
Just say you will

01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.200
Come on now

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:44.700
Many people are in need of love

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.700
See them coming to you, Lord

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:51.400
Just as I am, I'm in need
of the blood of the lamb

01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:56.100
Oh, my soul, I say yeah

01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.400

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.000
Help me, Lord

01:45:04.100 --> 01:45:07.500
I know I can't do this
by myself

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:14.200
I surrender, Lord

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.400
Yeah

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.200
Do you believe?

01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.500
Somebody, please

Somebody ought to
send up a song, yeah

he'll come in

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.700
Somebody tell me who is
the king of glory

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.200
The lord God, strong and mighty

01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:53.100
Do you know Jesus?

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:57.900

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.300
Yes

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.000
Father God, we thank you...

01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:20.200
for this delicious meal
that we are about to partake in.

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:22.300
We ask that
you would bless us...

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.900
in the decisions that
we've made for you today.

01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:27.700
Keep us strong as a unit,
Father.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.400
We give you glory and honor
in the name of--

01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.800
Amen, amen, amen.

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:34.400
-Amen.
-Amen. Amen.

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.300
Y'all ain't had greens
like this before, baby.

01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:39.100
I put my foot in it.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.100
Give me some cornbread.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:43.000
Go ahead and eat something,
Myrtle Jean.

01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:44.600
You know I'm hungry.

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.700
Charles?

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:51.900
You know I love you, right?

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.500
Yeah.

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:57.100
And you know
I'll always be your friend.

01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:03.600
Do you forgive me?

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.400
I already have.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:15.500
Not just for what I did to you.

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.200
I'm in love.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:17.000
Where are you going?

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:22.400
I'm going to find my man.

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.100
Go get him, girl,
wherever he's at.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.100
Yeah, aunt Helen.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.500
Bye, y'all.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.900
Lord have mercy.
I knowed it. I knowed it.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.500
Come on, Ike Turner.
Go on out there and get her.

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:53.300
Orlando! Orlando!

01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:56.400
Ma'am! Whoa, ma'am!
You can't go in there!

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:58.700
That's not safe! Whoa!

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:01.000
Orlando!

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Orlando!

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.200
You have to stop.

01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:07.700
Orlando! Orlando!

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.000
Ma'am, you've got to stop.

01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:12.000
Orlando, where are you?

01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:15.400
Sorry. You've got--
This is too dangerous.

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.400
It's not safe.
I've got to ask you to leave.

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.200
Boss, she's all right.
She's with me.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.200
What are you doing here, Helen?

01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.700
I gave it all up.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.300
What?

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:30.400
I just want you.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.000
I just want you.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:42.000
Ask me again.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.400
Ask me again. I love you.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:50.000
Now, how do you
know that, Helen?

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:58.600
I carry you in my spirit.

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:02.200
I pray for you...

01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:05.200
more than I pray for myself.

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:11.100
And if you're away
for more than an hour...

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.000
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.800
And your smile.

01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:23.200
When you smile,
my world is all right.

01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:29.800
Ask me again. I love you.

01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:32.700
Ask me again.

01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:38.700
Will you marry me?

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.100
Yes.

01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:45.100
Yes. Yes.

01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.900
Oh, Helen.

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:56.700
This woman right here
wants to marry me, y'all!

01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:59.900
She wants to marry me!

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.500
Mary lost her faith

01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:39.200
'Cause her brother had died

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:41.300
Jesus came forth

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:44.200
Saying, "Lazarus, be untied"

01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:48.900
No matter how bad
you think it is

01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:51.500
If you leave it at his feet

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.400
He'll give you pity, yeah

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.700
No matter what

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.000
You may be going through

01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:01.400
Take it to the master

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:03.500
He'll see you right on through

01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:06.100
I know Jesus

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.300
Take it to him

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.500
You can leave it there

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.400
He will work it out

01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:15.500
No matter what

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:18.300
You might be going through

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:21.000
He will work it out

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:24.500
Pass it on, yeah

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.800
Don't let nobody

01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.200
Turn you around

01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:31.300
Give it to Jesus

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.700
He'll never let you down

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.200
Take it to Jesus

01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.300
Take it to Jesus

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.300
Take, take, take it to Jesus

01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.000
Take, take, take, take, take

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:46.500
Take, take, take it to Jesus

01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.900
He will be right there

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
All your problems

01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.200
Every situation

01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:56.400
He will work it out, yeah

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:23.900
I'll tell you. There ain't
nothing on TV no more.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Redd Foxx died, and all
the good TV went to hell.

01:53:27.100 --> 01:53:29.200
Yes.

01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:33.700
Donna Richardson on there
"Sweating in the Spirit."

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:35.500
Hold it here.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.800
Yes, Lord. Thank you
for Donna Richardson, Lord.

01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.800
Thank you for
Donna Richardson, Lord.

01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:42.800
...with the arms
swooping up and over.

01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:44.500
Reach over. Here we go.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.000
Now, keep your feet planted.
Separate them wider.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:48.700
And separate. Pick it up.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:51.800
Do it. Down. Down.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.900
Ooh, she did it!

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.700
Aw, hell, Donna.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:59.000
You don't do that to me, baby.

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.200
Oxygen. Oxygen.

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:02.100
This time,
when we come back up...

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.800
lift the arms above the head.

01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.800
Lift it up, two, three.

01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:09.000
Now, I really want you
to still concentrate...

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.700
on what the legs are doing.

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.900
Continue your breathing.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.200
That's it. Come on.

01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.800
When your muscles are working...

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:17.500
you've got to breathe it out.

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:19.800
And lower back down.
One more. Lift it up.

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:22.000
You're trying
to kill me, Donna.

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:24.000
Trying to kill me.

01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.200
And action.

01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:27.600
Harpo, who this woman?

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.000
Harpo, I say, who this woman?

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.500
Joe, leave that child alone.

01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.300
Where's your medicine?

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.200
They're at home. Where's yours?

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.300
I'm sorry.

01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.400
That's all right.

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.400
Harpo, who this woman?

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:47.000
Wait a minute.
I need somebody else...

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.300
to read that.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:50.600
Harpo, who this woman?

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.200
I say, Harpo, who this woman?

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:53.800
Joe, leave that child alone.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.300
You take your medicine?

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:57.500
They're at home. Where's yours?

01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.000
That won't cut.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.800
-You want some?
-No.

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:14.600
You sure?

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:16.000
I'm positive.

01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:17.100
Come on, John.

01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:18.500
Just have a little bit of it.

01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.600
Not me.

01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.100
Not you?
John, you want some?

01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:23.200
No.

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.600
All right.

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.100
I love you, Daddy.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.800
OK. All right.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.500
I love you, Dad--

01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.100
Come on, man.

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:39.000
All right. Come on.

01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:44.100
Man, we're gonna be here
all night with you.

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:45.800
Come on. One more time.

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.300
I got a funny bone.

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.700
You got a funny bone?
OK. All right.

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:51.700
You might want to cut there,
because I don't--

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:55.900
I done rubbed off
on her too much.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.300
She's gonna need to mail it.

01:55:58.300 --> 01:56:02.600
You ain't supposed
to leave a man at the table.

01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.100
At least wait
till you get in the car to--

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.100
She embarrassed
the hell out of you...

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:10.700
in front of the whole family.

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:14.400
That got to hurt.
You ought to feel this big.

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:16.700
Matter of fact,
she told me you were--

01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.200
I'm just--
