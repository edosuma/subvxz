26:06.299 --> 26:08.165
[groaning]

26:08.167 --> 26:09.900
[man] Relax. Relax.

26:10.703 --> 26:11.869
I have something...

26:11.871 --> 26:13.871
something inspired
by our own government.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.074
Lethal injection.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.109
- [Josh whimpers]
- [man] Uh-huh.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.115
I do tend to use a little extra
potassium chloride.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.350
- Yeah.
- [Josh whimpers]

26:36.896 --> 26:38.996
- [man exhales deeply]
- [Josh groans]

26:39.865 --> 26:42.066
[Josh grunting]

26:44.103 --> 26:46.704
[man] There, there. Relax.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.205
[man shushes]

26:48.207 --> 26:50.207
[clicks tongue]

26:50.208 --> 26:52.208
[man] It typically starts
with one single sore,

26:52.211 --> 26:53.277
the entry point.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.212
It breaks in.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.782
- Infiltrates enemy lines.
- [Josh gasping]

26:59.819 --> 27:01.785
It nags, it lingers. It...

27:01.787 --> 27:04.054
[Josh gagging]

27:04.056 --> 27:05.122
[man] It fights.

27:05.858 --> 27:07.024
It builds an army.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.361
- And then...
- [Josh gasping]

27:10.363 --> 27:11.629
...poof.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.298
[Josh groaning]

27:18.938 --> 27:20.304
[man] Within seconds...

27:22.642 --> 27:23.707
your heart...

27:25.344 --> 27:26.410
surrenders.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.851
Everything's
gonna be okay, Josh.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.754
[James] You're free.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.926
[James sighs deeply]

27:50.703 --> 27:52.302
[Brian grunting]

27:52.304 --> 27:53.370
[phone ringing]

27:53.372 --> 27:54.972
[groans]

27:55.408 --> 27:57.207
[phone ringing]

27:57.209 --> 28:00.110
[TV reporter
speaking indistinctly]

28:00.112 --> 28:01.178
Dana.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.880
<i>[Dana]Brian, I can't find Josh.</i>

28:02.882 --> 28:04.381
Huh? Hey, calm down.
Sorry, what?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.400
[Dana] <i> I know he went out</i>
<i>last night, drinking.</i>

28:06.401 --> 28:08.418
<i>This is the last time.
I'm not gonna take this shit</i>

28:08.421 --> 28:10.921
<i>- anymore.</i>
- No, you know what, I'm...

28:10.923 --> 28:12.289
He'll be all right.
I'll make some phone calls.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.957
Just stay by your phone,
I'll call you back, okay?

28:13.959 --> 28:15.392
[Dana] <i> Tell you brother</i>
<i>to get his ass--</i>

28:15.394 --> 28:16.460
[phone beeps]

28:21.367 --> 28:24.001
[Brian panting]

28:36.015 --> 28:37.781
[Brian] This guy, um...

28:39.318 --> 28:41.251
Have you seen him lately?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.387
[Lisa] I saw him
last night, actually.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.022
But I think he left with a pro.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.393
Can you describe her?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.795
[Lisa] Yeah, she was,
uh, early 30's.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.297
Tall, brown hair.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.364
Kinda pale.

28:55.835 --> 28:56.900
Huh.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.269
Yeah, all right.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.771
Yeah. I mean, keep it.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.641
Do you know where they went?

29:03.642 --> 29:05.075
[James] <i> What potential</i>
<i>do foster parents</i>

29:05.077 --> 29:06.376
<i>possess themselves?</i>

29:07.313 --> 29:09.880
<i>They're an abomination.</i>

29:09.882 --> 29:12.316
<i>God himself, has cursed them.</i>

29:12.318 --> 29:13.784
<i>They, they cannot,</i>

29:13.786 --> 29:15.819
<i>of their own accord,
bear children.</i>

29:15.821 --> 29:18.822
<i>They cannot bear fruit,
and like maggots,</i>

29:18.824 --> 29:20.958
<i>they must feast on the flesh</i>

29:20.960 --> 29:22.526
<i>of those
who do not belong to them,</i>

29:22.528 --> 29:24.094
- <i>in order to feel...</i>
- [phone ringing]

29:24.096 --> 29:25.162
[mouse clicks]

29:26.265 --> 29:28.349
Where are you?

29:28.350 --> 29:30.434
Parker put you
on my brother's case, right?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.336
Yes. But, Brian, are you okay?

29:32.338 --> 29:35.405
All right, look.
Josh's wife called me.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.141
She hasn't seen him.
She's worried sick.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.877
So, I went to visit
a couple places

29:39.879 --> 29:41.145
that we used to go.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.913
<i>[Brian]The bartender at Jones'</i>

29:42.915 --> 29:46.383
<i>remembers seeing him leave
with a pro last night.</i>

29:46.385 --> 29:48.185
Anadelle Motel,
you ever heard of it?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.966
- [door opens]
- [bell rings]

30:04.370 --> 30:05.469
[Rose] Can I help you?

30:07.506 --> 30:10.240
[Erica] Detective Shotwell,
Detective Abrams.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.026
We're looking for someone

30:12.027 --> 30:13.811
who might have
passed through here last night.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.546
Uh, may I please see
your log sheet?

30:18.484 --> 30:21.351
Okay, well, I can
speed things up, if you'd like.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.086
Just takes one call
to my superiors.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.988
Then I submit an affidavit
to the judge

30:24.990 --> 30:27.090
that states that you are running
a prostitution ring

30:27.092 --> 30:28.342
out of this motel.

30:28.343 --> 30:29.593
[Erica] They will come here.
They will take your license,

30:29.595 --> 30:30.861
they will take your motel.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.396
And they will give you
five to ten.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.364
Or you can just show me
the log sheet,

30:34.366 --> 30:36.233
and this conversation
never happened.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.504
Is this the shooter station?

30:40.506 --> 30:42.573
[Rose] Mm-hm.

30:42.575 --> 30:45.075
[Abrams] Did you read
the section on Point St. George?

30:45.077 --> 30:46.543
I went there last spring.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.378
[gasps]

30:49.014 --> 30:50.280
Gorgeous.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.517
[Erica] Peter Piper.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.986
- [Abrams] That's a pseudonym.
- You think?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.423
- All right, look.
- [Rose sighs]

31:01.427 --> 31:05.128
Is this the Peter Piper
that checked in last night?

31:05.130 --> 31:07.497
It's hard to say.
He's fine-looking.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.900
[Abrams] A shrike?

31:11.570 --> 31:13.003
[gasps]

31:18.944 --> 31:21.378
They pierce their food
on thorns.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.981
It holds them in position
so they can eat small bites.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.949
- [Rose chuckles]
- Abrams.

31:28.621 --> 31:30.053
[Abrams] Uh, sorry.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.922
I'm gonna need to see this room.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.228
[keys jangling]

31:44.937 --> 31:46.637
- [door clatters]
- [bell rings]

31:50.109 --> 31:53.911
You should take some
of my apples home with you.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.313
My crops this year
have been delicious.

31:57.983 --> 31:59.483
[Abrams] Is that a temptation?

32:02.621 --> 32:04.421
<i>Malus Domestica.</i>

32:05.925 --> 32:08.625
It's the fall of humanity.

32:08.627 --> 32:12.162
[Abrams] Actually, in Norse
and Greek mythology,

32:13.265 --> 32:15.565
this represents eternal youth.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.667
- Really?
- [keys jangle]

32:21.273 --> 32:22.940
[mouths]
What are you doing?

32:25.110 --> 32:26.610
- [Abrams] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:27.513 --> 32:28.645
[Erica] Thank you.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.252
[Parker] Okay.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.454
So, Josh bunks
with the lady of the evening

32:37.456 --> 32:39.056
at the no-tell-motel.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.391
This was his room.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.226
[Erica] We swept it.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.294
But...

32:46.699 --> 32:47.965
Oh.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.000
We did find something.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.538
[Erica] It's a fingernail.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.573
In Whitley's file, he took them
from all of the victims.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.643
If that fingernail
belongs to Josh Ridley...

32:59.645 --> 33:02.679
why him? He's not a kid.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.282
Well, he has to finish
what he started.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.483
There's something that I found

33:06.485 --> 33:08.418
that I think
you'll find interesting.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.154
So, all ten of the victims
were taken

33:11.156 --> 33:13.056
from or around Julian.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.658
[Erica] And although
Whitley's spree

33:14.660 --> 33:16.693
lasted for 11 years,

33:16.695 --> 33:19.629
He took them all
at the same time of year.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.264
It's a cyclical pattern.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.667
And the fingernails?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.736
The fingernails
are part of his M.O.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.338
So, our one dead body
was missing hers.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.506
And in the mineshaft,

33:29.508 --> 33:32.209
we had jars of fingernails
and seeds.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.711
And then, saplings, alongside.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.513
But her cause of death,

33:36.515 --> 33:38.615
the potassium chloride
is consistent

33:38.617 --> 33:40.083
with the other victim's DNA

33:40.085 --> 33:42.452
found on the hypodermic needles
in the shaft.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.289
He was essentially euthanizing
all of these foster children.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.091
[Abrams] He's kinda like a bird.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.159
What's that?

33:50.162 --> 33:52.462
Well, it, sort of, uh...

33:52.464 --> 33:54.164
There's evidence.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.166
It's all the victims
in the mine.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.467
You'd keep them there.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.136
Like a nest.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.038
No matter how far you had to go
to find someone,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.273
he would always return to it.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.244
What, what I don't understand
is why

34:07.246 --> 34:08.745
he did it all around here.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.250
Now, listen. I know that Larson
is still working this case.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.485
[Parker] So I'd like
the two of you to bring him in.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.753
And I'd like the two of you

34:16.755 --> 34:18.221
to go get
the other two brothers.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.590
Please, okay? Thank you.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.059
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.327
Abrams get a haircut, all right?
Jesus Christ.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.795
Yeah.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.504
[Erica] Hey.
Has my partner been in today?

34:34.505 --> 34:35.772
- Larson?
- Yeah.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.139
[bartender] No,
I haven't seen him yet.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.176
Okay, can I give you my number?

34:39.178 --> 34:42.279
- Sure.
- [Erica] If he shows up...

34:42.281 --> 34:43.746
- can you give me a call?
- [bartender] Yeah, you bet.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.815
Thanks.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.150
[Erica] Larson.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.721
Larson!

34:54.493 --> 34:56.092
Where the hell are you?

34:58.664 --> 35:00.130
[lock clicks]

35:04.803 --> 35:06.136
[Erica] Larson!

35:19.885 --> 35:22.786
[foreboding music]

35:33.198 --> 35:34.464
Those poor kids.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.201
[Erica] Jesus.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.272
[car door closes]

35:49.648 --> 35:52.349
[ominous music]

36:02.494 --> 36:03.860
[thuds]

36:10.435 --> 36:11.635
[door opens]

36:12.437 --> 36:13.503
[metal clanking]

36:15.574 --> 36:16.840
I could have
blown your head off.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.842
[Erica sighs]

36:20.612 --> 36:21.678
[Erica] Oh, my god.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.519
- Why all the secrecy?
- [keys jangle]

36:29.922 --> 36:31.288
Thank you.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.760
Make yourself at home.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.963
[Erica] Hey, what's up
with your phone?

36:39.964 --> 36:41.397
I've been trying to call you
all day, I was worried.

36:42.734 --> 36:43.900
It's dead.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.804
[Brian] Why don't you
lock your door?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.806
[Erica scoffs]
I did.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.374
Well, then you need to get
a better lock.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.679
Did you go to the motel?

36:57.983 --> 36:59.282
Yeah.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.218
[Brian] And?

37:01.220 --> 37:03.620
I found a fingernail
under the bed

37:03.622 --> 37:05.222
- in Josh Ridley's room.
- Oh, fuck!

37:05.224 --> 37:06.489
[Brian] Oh, fuck!

37:06.491 --> 37:08.225
[Brian groans]

37:08.227 --> 37:10.560
[panting]

37:10.562 --> 37:12.696
It's happening again.
Whitley has him.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.331
[sighs deeply]

37:14.333 --> 37:15.799
We'll find him.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.266
Uh, you need to tell me
where the other boys are

37:17.269 --> 37:19.453
so that we can help.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.638
Why am I not
on this case, Erica, huh?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.940
It is fucking bullshit,
I am the only one--

37:23.942 --> 37:25.675
We're all here
trying to solve this.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.377
We're all trying
to catch him, okay?

37:27.379 --> 37:28.979
You had me taken off the case,
didn't you?

37:28.981 --> 37:30.347
Why would I do that?

37:30.349 --> 37:31.648
You come into this town,

37:31.650 --> 37:34.751
and you start planting seeds
in Parker's head.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.519
Okay, that's why
this can't work.

37:38.824 --> 37:39.606
You need to leave.

37:39.607 --> 37:40.389
- [breathing heavily]
- [Erica] Get out!

37:44.563 --> 37:46.596
I'll fucking go. I'm gonna go.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.031
[pants]

37:48.033 --> 37:49.666
- You want me to go?
- Yes.

37:51.336 --> 37:52.569
You want me to go?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.961
[ominous music]

38:17.963 --> 38:19.562
[loud thud]

38:21.600 --> 38:23.700
[object clattering]

38:27.873 --> 38:30.440
Brian, are we gonna
make it out of here?

38:30.442 --> 38:32.309
[shushes]

38:32.311 --> 38:33.710
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.645
Hear that?

38:36.648 --> 38:37.981
[Brian groans]

38:40.852 --> 38:41.918
Oh, god.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.092
[man groans]

38:56.001 --> 38:58.068
[foreboding music]

39:02.574 --> 39:03.973
- Brian! Brian, Brian!
- [Brian grunts]

39:03.975 --> 39:06.509
- It's okay, it's okay.
- [Brian panting]

39:06.511 --> 39:08.945
[Erica] You're here with me.
You're okay, you're okay.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.114
- You're safe, okay?
- [Brian panting]

39:11.116 --> 39:14.417
I'm here with you. I got you.
I got you, I got you.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.586
- [Brian panting heavily]
- I got you.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.455
[Erica] You're okay,
you're safe.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.140
It's okay, sweetheart.

39:20.141 --> 39:21.824
I know what you're feeling.
I know what's happening.

39:21.827 --> 39:22.926
This happens to me sometimes.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.694
It used to happen to me
all the time.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.996
Right when I got back.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.634
Remember, you wanted to know...

39:32.404 --> 39:34.938
why I left the military.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.072
[Brian] Yeah.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.475
You know,
where we were stationed,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.443
we were basically peacekeepers.

39:41.146 --> 39:44.981
You know, we dig wells, and...

39:44.983 --> 39:48.651
help the village people, kinda,
build up an infrastructure.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.056
We, we helped them
set-up a preschool.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.026
I used to play
with all the kids.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.564
There's one, one little boy
in particular.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.932
His name was Afjah.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.869
Which means "most beautiful".

40:06.972 --> 40:08.538
He was so funny.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.476
We used to kick around
a soccer ball.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.445
We didn't really speak,
just like,

40:15.447 --> 40:17.480
we'd teach each other
a few words.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.017
The next week
we got credible intel,

40:21.019 --> 40:24.020
that there was an insurgent cell
at this one address,

40:24.022 --> 40:26.956
and near certainty
that the target was there

40:26.958 --> 40:28.725
and there would be
no civilian casualties.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.794
So, the next morning,

40:30.796 --> 40:33.430
when it... when it was time
for us to, um...

40:35.066 --> 40:37.901
to go and, you know,
clean everything up.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.803
And, you know, follow, um...

40:45.210 --> 40:46.876
It was, it was...

40:48.613 --> 40:50.647
It was Afjah's house.

40:55.187 --> 40:56.786
And I, I...
[sobbing]

40:57.622 --> 40:59.856
I found him in the rubble.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.758
His little body.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.160
His eyes were wide open.
[whimpering]

41:04.162 --> 41:07.730
I killed him. I... killed him.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.000
[Erica sobbing]

41:13.138 --> 41:14.237
[whimpers]

41:18.510 --> 41:20.944
[stuttering]
I just... I, I...

41:20.946 --> 41:23.580
For the longest time, I just,
every night I would wake up

41:23.582 --> 41:25.882
and I would, I would...
I would see his face.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.118
[Erica] It, it gets better.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.520
It'll get better. It's...

41:30.522 --> 41:33.523
Fewer and fewer times.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.258
It's not happening
very much anymore.

41:42.234 --> 41:44.567
[Erica] I'll be here for you.
I'll help you through it.

41:48.907 --> 41:51.140
[calm music]

41:57.816 --> 41:59.015
[knocking on door]

42:11.930 --> 42:13.696
You look like shit, man.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.133
[Matt] What's up?

42:20.038 --> 42:21.771
- Fridge?
- [Matt] Yeah.

42:25.076 --> 42:27.043
I don't understand
how this can happen, you know?

42:30.916 --> 42:32.782
Why isn't Whitley dead?

42:32.784 --> 42:35.084
Well, because...
[sighs]

42:35.086 --> 42:36.686
...we had a shit prosecutor.

42:36.688 --> 42:38.121
A shit legal system.

42:43.695 --> 42:44.711
Yeah.

42:44.712 --> 42:45.728
Hey, I got a question
for you. Uh...

42:47.732 --> 42:49.232
Has Josh called you?

42:51.269 --> 42:52.569
No. You?

42:53.038 --> 42:54.137
Uh-uh.

42:55.273 --> 42:57.707
No, I went to Jones' Bar, and...

42:59.244 --> 43:00.977
- Yeah.
- ...he was there two nights ago.

43:00.979 --> 43:02.245
[Brian] He left with a hooker.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.180
And he ended up
in a motel off of 48.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.653
[Brian sighs]

43:20.031 --> 43:21.998
- Bro.
- [Brian] Hm?

43:23.635 --> 43:25.168
You're on the case though,
right?

43:27.839 --> 43:29.606
Temporarily reassigned.

43:37.082 --> 43:38.314
How are you doing, kid?

43:40.719 --> 43:42.218
- Staying afloat.
- [Brian] Yeah?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.156
Why don't you take me up
on my offer

43:47.158 --> 43:49.208
to go back to school?

43:49.209 --> 43:51.259
I mean, you're wasting your time
at that restaurant.

43:51.262 --> 43:52.328
It's probably not the day

43:52.330 --> 43:54.063
to have
a big brother conversation.

44:00.705 --> 44:01.771
You're right.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.149
Do you got a light?

44:14.853 --> 44:15.918
Huh?

44:19.024 --> 44:20.256
Thanks, buddy.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.200
Oh, man.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.269
Have you talked to,
have you talked to Georgie?

44:35.874 --> 44:36.973
No.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.810
I haven't heard from him
in years, man.

44:56.127 --> 44:57.794
[cellphone ringing]

45:00.732 --> 45:02.432
[chatter on TV]

45:06.705 --> 45:08.171
[cellphone ringing]

45:14.946 --> 45:19.115
[TV reporter
speaking indistinctly]

45:19.117 --> 45:20.817
[Matt] Rise and shine, buddy.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.954
[groans]
Thanks, man.

45:24.956 --> 45:27.190
[Matt] A little hangover cure.

45:28.927 --> 45:30.059
Thank you, Matt.

45:34.766 --> 45:35.898
You sleep all right?

45:37.402 --> 45:38.968
No, my neck, it's...

45:40.071 --> 45:41.270
Sorry.
[chuckles]

45:41.272 --> 45:43.072
Like Old Bob.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.873
[news reporter] <i> We've been</i>
<i>notified that James Whitley</i>

45:44.876 --> 45:47.110
<i>is one of the convicts
that escaped.</i>

45:47.112 --> 45:49.479
<i>You might remember
the horrific story of Whitley.</i>

45:49.481 --> 45:51.848
<i>Who wreaked havoc
on our small town</i>

45:51.850 --> 45:53.349
<i>almost 30 years ago.</i>

45:54.152 --> 45:55.852
[Brian] Oh, shit!

45:57.288 --> 45:59.155
Shit! They leaked the pictures.

45:59.157 --> 46:01.390
These sons of bitches
leaked the pictures!

46:01.392 --> 46:03.059
Matt, get your keys!

46:03.061 --> 46:04.127
Matt!

46:05.964 --> 46:07.396
[Brian] <i> Parker!</i>

46:11.136 --> 46:12.969
- [Davis] Hey. Hey, hey.
- [objects clatter]

46:12.971 --> 46:14.771
- You need to calm down.
- Hey, hey. Hey!

46:14.773 --> 46:15.838
You need to calm down!

46:15.840 --> 46:17.273
[officer] Hey,
he said calm down.

46:17.275 --> 46:18.341
Okay, Larson.

46:18.343 --> 46:19.876
[Brian] Out of my way.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.310
Did you see
the news this morning?

46:21.312 --> 46:23.446
Huh? Did you see
the news this morning?

46:23.448 --> 46:25.214
Yes, I did.

46:25.216 --> 46:27.016
This is the only office

46:27.018 --> 46:29.018
where the press can get
those pictures from.

46:29.020 --> 46:31.154
Why would I leak them?

46:31.156 --> 46:33.523
I don't know, Parker. Why?
Why the fuck would you do that?

46:33.525 --> 46:35.558
I think you're a stupid ass.

46:35.560 --> 46:37.243
You've forgotten
what I did for you,

46:37.244 --> 46:38.927
and I'm gonna tell you
something right now.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.496
You got ten seconds
to make a U-turn,

46:40.498 --> 46:43.166
or put your badge
and gun on the desk!

46:43.168 --> 46:45.234
And get the fuck out of here.
Now!

46:52.811 --> 46:53.910
I'm sorry.

46:56.514 --> 46:57.947
Oh, Christ.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.353
Oh, Jesus.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.022
How the fuck did that happen?

47:14.299 --> 47:15.431
[sighs]

47:19.070 --> 47:20.169
[Abrams] What do you think?

47:22.140 --> 47:24.207
I think Josh Ridley's dead.

47:24.209 --> 47:26.275
Well, he could have ran off
with that prostitute.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.945
Mm-hm. I think he's part
of Whitney's ritual.

47:28.947 --> 47:31.013
What I'm fixated on,
is the fingernails.

47:32.450 --> 47:34.550
You know, I just read an article

47:34.552 --> 47:37.019
that proposed, people
with reoccurring obsessions,

47:37.021 --> 47:40.022
the most significant memories
often play out in their actions.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.490
The fingernails,
it could be this...

47:41.492 --> 47:44.260
mental marker. Some past trauma.

47:47.098 --> 47:49.065
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you.

47:49.067 --> 47:50.132
[Abrams]
Do you have any hobbies?

47:50.134 --> 47:51.367
No.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.202
Everybody has a hobby.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.904
It's personal.

47:54.906 --> 47:56.639
Come on. You know mine.

47:56.641 --> 47:59.141
That's cause you like
talking about it.

47:59.143 --> 48:01.477
Come on, I won't tell anyone.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.612
I hunt birds.

48:05.250 --> 48:06.315
Oh.

48:07.652 --> 48:09.252
- [chuckles]
- [doorbell chimes]

48:13.658 --> 48:16.158
[Nadine] Josh was always
the ladies' man.

48:16.160 --> 48:18.895
But he and Dana
were having a lot of...

48:18.897 --> 48:22.098
issues lately, I'm sorry to say.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.599
You know,
maybe he went to Vegas.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.535
He's done that before.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.470
We have reason to believe
that he is still in town.

48:27.472 --> 48:30.339
We just are having trouble
locating him.

48:30.341 --> 48:32.275
You work with my Brian,
don't you?

48:33.411 --> 48:34.610
He's my partner.

48:35.613 --> 48:37.680
Well, I...

48:37.682 --> 48:39.982
Oh, well, uh,
why don't you ask him?

48:39.984 --> 48:41.517
I'm sure he can help.

48:41.519 --> 48:43.219
He's currently on leave.

48:43.221 --> 48:45.554
[Nadine] Well, listen.
If anybody can find Josh,

48:45.556 --> 48:47.823
it's Brian.

48:47.824 --> 48:50.091
He was always such a good
big brother, growing up.

48:50.094 --> 48:52.194
And all his foster brothers
looked up to him.

48:58.069 --> 49:00.569
Do you mind
if ask about George Middleton?

49:00.571 --> 49:02.405
[Erica] We don't have
an address for him.

49:04.409 --> 49:05.708
[Nadine] Oh, Georgie.

49:07.412 --> 49:09.512
He was always so troubled.

49:10.715 --> 49:12.214
A lost soul.

49:14.619 --> 49:19.322
And you know, he never really
accepted me as his mother.

49:21.426 --> 49:22.725
But I loved him.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.296
[Nadine] I knew it was
just a matter of time

49:27.298 --> 49:29.198
before he moved on.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.133
It started when he was just, uh,

49:31.135 --> 49:32.335
just a boy.

49:33.571 --> 49:36.272
And then, it got really bad
in high school.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.743
His classmates would bully him,

49:42.246 --> 49:43.579
and harass him.

49:45.316 --> 49:46.482
[sniffles]

49:47.218 --> 49:48.551
And sometimes...

49:50.021 --> 49:52.321
he would just run home
from school

49:52.323 --> 49:54.390
and go straight to his room,
because...

49:55.393 --> 49:57.660
he didn't want me
to see his face.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.099
Oh, thank you.

50:03.101 --> 50:04.567
[sniffles]

50:07.572 --> 50:11.340
I will never forget
the day it happened.

50:11.342 --> 50:14.010
[Nadine] The day Whitley
came into our lives.

50:17.215 --> 50:19.081
[inhales deeply]

50:19.083 --> 50:21.617
There was a knock on the door.

50:21.619 --> 50:24.553
[Nadine] <i> He introduced himself</i>
<i>and all.</i>

50:24.555 --> 50:26.422
He was very polite.

50:26.424 --> 50:28.657
Charismatic, even.

50:28.659 --> 50:31.594
And he claimed to have worked
for social services.

50:31.596 --> 50:35.064
[Nadine] <i> He even had</i>
<i>all the paperwork.</i>

50:35.066 --> 50:37.767
And then, he wanted to speak
with all four boys.

50:39.670 --> 50:43.305
There had been
some speculation that...

50:43.307 --> 50:46.809
that I was mistreating
the boys, but...

50:47.345 --> 50:48.411
[sighs]

50:48.413 --> 50:50.780
...I would never lay
a hand on them.

50:50.782 --> 50:52.048
Never.

50:53.751 --> 50:55.117
[Nadine] <i> And then...</i>

50:57.255 --> 50:58.621
<i>he took them from me.</i>

51:01.526 --> 51:02.725
<i>He took them.</i>

51:07.532 --> 51:10.232
With James Whitley
being on the loose,

51:10.234 --> 51:11.567
your foster children will be--

51:11.569 --> 51:13.769
[Nadine] My children, Detective.

51:14.372 --> 51:15.438
Mine.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.708
What I meant to say is that,

51:19.710 --> 51:22.478
just ascertaining
their whereabouts, their safety,

51:22.480 --> 51:24.480
Perhaps, putting them
into protective custody

51:24.482 --> 51:26.549
till this is all over.
That's, that's our goal.

51:27.685 --> 51:31.287
Our records show
that George moved out...

51:31.289 --> 51:32.788
when he became a legal adult?

51:32.790 --> 51:35.591
Yeah. Right after
he dropped out of school.

51:38.362 --> 51:40.696
Do you have any way
of reaching out to him?

51:40.698 --> 51:42.131
[Nadine] He did
mention something

51:42.133 --> 51:43.599
the last time he wrote me.

51:43.601 --> 51:45.501
He said he was living in a...

51:46.370 --> 51:49.705
mobile home, an RV, or...

51:49.707 --> 51:52.408
Or in a mobile park
or something.

51:55.713 --> 51:56.846
But you know...

51:58.449 --> 52:01.817
it's hard to find someone
who just doesn't wanna be found.

52:04.722 --> 52:06.122
[Abrams] Thank you.

52:09.293 --> 52:12.828
Hey, uh, I'd like you to run
a DMV database check for me.

52:12.830 --> 52:15.598
See whether any RV
or mobile home

52:15.600 --> 52:18.167
has been registered
to George Middleton, thanks.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.413
[Brian] <i> How are you dealing</i>
<i>with all this, Matty?</i>

52:31.415 --> 52:32.915
[Matt] I'm not doing good, man.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.619
All this shit's coming back.

52:36.621 --> 52:38.554
All the real bad shit.

52:39.290 --> 52:40.356
[scoffs]

52:41.726 --> 52:43.292
I'm scared.

52:43.294 --> 52:44.627
How about the girl?

52:45.396 --> 52:46.629
Is she helping you?

52:47.865 --> 52:48.931
We tried.

52:48.933 --> 52:50.432
[Brian] What do you mean
you tried?

52:50.434 --> 52:52.401
Just... you just try harder,
actually.

52:52.403 --> 52:53.469
[Brian chuckles]

52:56.207 --> 52:57.907
You don't think
I don't want that?

52:59.677 --> 53:01.510
[Matt]
To live happily ever after?

53:03.681 --> 53:07.416
And not think about Whitley
and the cage he put me in?

53:07.418 --> 53:08.817
[Brian] We should not
talk about it.

53:09.954 --> 53:11.654
[Matt] He's coming for me.

53:11.656 --> 53:13.489
- I'm scared, Brian.
- [Brian] It's okay.

53:13.491 --> 53:14.823
- I'm scared.
- [Brian] It's okay.

53:14.825 --> 53:16.859
Hey, it's okay.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.627
[Brian] It's okay.

53:18.629 --> 53:21.230
[Matt] He ruined me, man.
[sobbing]

53:21.232 --> 53:22.398
He ruined me.

53:23.434 --> 53:24.567
Hey.

53:25.269 --> 53:26.535
[sniffles]

53:26.537 --> 53:28.404
Uh.
[clears throat]

53:30.274 --> 53:32.641
[Brian] Hey, Erica.
This is my baby brother.

53:32.643 --> 53:34.243
This is Matt.

53:34.245 --> 53:36.478
Matt, this is my partner,
Erica Shotwell.

53:38.749 --> 53:41.000
- Hey.
- [Matt] Hey.

53:41.001 --> 53:43.252
- Good to meet you.
- [Matt] You too, Erica.

53:43.254 --> 53:44.653
- [cellphone buzzing]
- [Brian] Hey.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.222
[scoffs]
It's Mom.

53:46.224 --> 53:47.590
[Matt] I gotta take this.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.325
Sure.

53:49.327 --> 53:50.659
[Matt] I'll give you guys
a minute.

53:53.965 --> 53:55.431
[Brian] Hey.

53:55.433 --> 53:56.599
[Erica] He seems sweet.

54:00.371 --> 54:01.837
- [Erica] You okay?
- Yeah.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.673
You know, you look pretty.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.610
Thank you.

54:07.612 --> 54:09.712
[Erica] Hey, you shoulda
let me know that you had Matt,

54:09.714 --> 54:11.814
I've been searching
all over for him today.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.316
You should let Parker know.

54:15.453 --> 54:17.953
We don't have much
on George yet,

54:17.955 --> 54:19.755
but I've been put in charge
of finding

54:19.757 --> 54:21.423
- all the boys--
- I've got Matt.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.859
I'm gonna go get George,
and I'll bring him in.

54:23.861 --> 54:25.794
[Brian] Okay?

54:25.796 --> 54:27.363
But, Brian,
maybe it'd be good if,

54:27.365 --> 54:29.382
if you let
other people help you.

54:29.383 --> 54:31.400
I will call you. You will be
the first person that I call.

54:31.402 --> 54:32.534
I promise you that.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.270
[Brian] Okay?

54:34.272 --> 54:35.938
I'll bring us in.
We'll all come in.

54:41.912 --> 54:42.978
Okay.

54:43.681 --> 54:44.747
[sighs]

54:50.554 --> 54:52.855
Ken, I need one more.

54:52.857 --> 54:54.290
[Brian] One more.

54:57.495 --> 54:58.727
[Erica] Thanks.

55:00.331 --> 55:02.564
[indistinct chatter]

55:14.011 --> 55:16.345
- [Brian] Who is that, man?
- [cellphone buzzing]

55:16.347 --> 55:17.680
[Brian] Who keeps calling you?

55:17.682 --> 55:19.348
[Matt] I don't know, man.

55:19.349 --> 55:21.015
You know, that's the same thing
that woke me up this morning.

55:21.018 --> 55:22.785
Who is that?

55:22.786 --> 55:24.553
I don't know,
I've just been ignoring it.

55:24.555 --> 55:25.954
Who the fuck is this?

55:27.792 --> 55:29.391
[Brian] George?

55:29.393 --> 55:30.826
You little weirdo.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.494
[both laugh]

55:32.496 --> 55:33.929
George.

55:33.931 --> 55:36.065
Buddy, yeah.

55:36.067 --> 55:38.067
Yeah, we'll come over.
We're looking for you.

56:40.564 --> 56:42.664
Captain, I'm on him now, but...

56:42.666 --> 56:44.066
Is this really necessary?

56:44.068 --> 56:45.618
I understand.

56:45.619 --> 56:47.169
You feel like
you're violating his trust.

56:47.171 --> 56:49.405
What I want you to do,
is get eyes on Middleton,

56:49.407 --> 56:51.039
as soon as you do,
you let me know.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.775
- Very good, sir.
- [phone beeps]

56:56.113 --> 56:57.880
You really think
Larson's hiding something?

57:05.022 --> 57:07.623
All right. Keep going,
let's lose them.

57:10.795 --> 57:12.761
[tires squeal]

57:16.967 --> 57:19.902

57:22.907 --> 57:24.907
We're close. Point three miles.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.746
[Erica] Oh, shit.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.749
Where'd they go?

57:33.751 --> 57:35.150
All right. Turn left up here.

57:41.625 --> 57:42.825
What are you writing?

57:43.994 --> 57:45.127
Observations.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.029
On what?

57:49.133 --> 57:50.466

You gotta come in, okay?

58:51.228 --> 58:53.996
I can't protect you

You sure this is him?

Hey, Georgie.

59:47.184 --> 59:48.850
It's good to see you guys.

59:58.162 --> 59:59.227
Hey, pal.

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:01.897
[Brian] Hey, pal.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.337
[George] You wanna--
Come on inside.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:22.317
Wow, jeez, Georgie.
You could use a maid.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.685
And a gardener.

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:25.087
[chuckles]

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:26.688
[George] Have a seat.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.824
Um, where are we
supposed to sit, pal?

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:42.771
[grunts]

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.980

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.315
Thanks, George.

Hey, George.

01:00:57.921 --> 01:00:59.438
Thanks.

01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:00.956
[George] Let me get you
guys some drinks.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.290
Great. Thanks, buddy.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:22.144
[Brian] So, how you've been,
Georgie?

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.047
Uh, real good.

01:01:35.926 --> 01:01:37.125
All right.

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.760
- Thanks, George.
- Now, um...

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:41.763
- Cheers.
- [glasses clink]

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:51.840
Wow.

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:53.375
Thanks, Georgie.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.816
[Matt] I spoke to Ma.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.217
She's worried about you.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:05.253
Why do you still call her that?

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.155
Come on, man. She's our mom.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.390
Hey.

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:09.925
Nadine was good to us.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:11.893
[Brian] We were lucky
to have her in our lives.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:17.299
Sorry.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.333
I just heard the news
about Pendleton.

01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:20.936
This is what we're gonna do.

01:02:20.937 --> 01:02:22.437
We're gonna stick together
until they catch Whitley.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:24.339
Well, you mentioned...

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:27.075
that Josh may have gone missing?

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:29.377
Yeah.

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:30.879
Two nights ago.

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:35.817
What are you talking about?

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:41.456
My partner found something
in the motel off of 48.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.758
What did they find?

01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:48.997
A fingernail.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:50.582
Why didn't you
tell me that, bro?

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.166
Because, Matt, you know
that I can't talk about

01:02:52.169 --> 01:02:53.468
an ongoing investigation.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:00.976
[sighs]

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:02.778
You said your partner found it?

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:06.348
Yeah, um...
[chuckles]

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.953
My partner,
the bird-loving shit for brain.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.889
[sighs]

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.160
Do you get...

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.461
I'm gonna use
your toilet, Georgie.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.562
[clatters]

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:55.163
Why did you leave us, George?

01:03:57.201 --> 01:04:00.001
Do I really need to answer
that question?

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.269
We grew up together, man.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.471
We were... we were brothers.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:05.974
Then you turned 18,
and you just disappeared on us.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.310
All people move on.

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.479
Things change.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:13.849
[George] I didn't see you
trying to find me.

01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:15.984
George, I meant...

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:19.855
[George] Did you know
that an adult lion...

01:04:19.857 --> 01:04:23.258
will eat the cubs that aren't
in the direct bloodline?

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.427
[George] It's true.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.431
You know why they do that?

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:34.336
Because, they're afraid...

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:37.906
that if the cubs grow up,

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.108
they'll eat the father,

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.310
and impregnate the mother.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:44.980
What?

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:47.916
And then I realized...

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.119
that we are those cubs.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:54.256
[George] You.

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:56.491
Me.

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:58.093
[thuds]

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.395
I'm back. We gotta go--

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.963
[thuds]

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:04.666
Our brother, the drunk.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:09.070
Born into fear.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:12.107
Afraid of what our
foster parents might do to us.

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:15.911
[George] Afraid
they might view us...

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:17.045
as a threat.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.684
It took me a really long time...

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.020
to realize...

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.522
that he was right.

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.359
He really was trying to save us.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.563
I made a deal, Matthew.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:39.367
What?

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:42.003
[George] Everything
is gonna be fine.

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:45.006
He's gonna send us
to see our real parents.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:50.078
[door opens, closes]

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.686
[Erica] Are you positive?

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:00.722
When?

01:06:00.724 --> 01:06:03.291
Okay, text it to me as soon
as you got it, all right?

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:04.392
Thanks.

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.096

01:06:14.538 --> 01:06:15.704
Oh, god.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.545
Wait. This is why
you had me stop here?

01:06:26.249 --> 01:06:27.515
My other one broke.

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:31.653

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.221

It's a goldfinch.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:37.793
Shit.

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:39.294
- [car engine revs]
- [wings fluttering]

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.333
[clatters, clanks]

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.402
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.575
Where'd you find it?

01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.210
[man] Sittin' on
the side of the road.

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:57.012
Like, a couple miles back.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:06:59.481
- [Abrams] Ha.
- [man] Gas tank was empty.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.083
Sure looks like the one
that was at the gas station.

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.151
- What was that?
- Yeah.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.619
- Oh, nothing.
- [lock clicking]

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:08.590
[sighs]

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.225
Whoa.

01:07:14.798 --> 01:07:17.098
Got anything interesting
up there?

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.466
Well, I need to look through.

01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:26.741
Huh.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:34.282
[cellphone ringing]

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:39.421
Shotwell.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.490
[bag rustling]

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.194
Okay. Thank you. Crap.

01:07:49.699 --> 01:07:50.799
Thanks.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.635
- [tapping]
- Abrams?

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.887
[Abrams] Yeah?

01:07:55.888 --> 01:07:58.138
Results say the fingernail
matched to Josh Ridley.

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.442
- What about the rest of him?
- You guys want an apple?

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:02.143
Oh, I'm good, thanks.

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.578
Yeah, sure. I'll take one.

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:05.647
[Abrams] Oh.

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:08.083
It's the best harvest we've had
since the fire.

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:09.317
What fire?

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:10.785
You know. The Bly place.

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:13.154
[crunches]

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:16.791
We have to go. Come on.
Thank you.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.093
- [Erica] Good bye.
- [man] Sure.

01:08:19.629 --> 01:08:22.130
This is the transcript
of Whitley's interrogation.

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.182
Look here.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.233
[Erica] He sees foster parents
as an abomination.

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:27.801
Then, there's the time of year.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:30.138
Look at the leaves,
early September,

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.738
to late November. What is that?

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.442
Harvest season.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.845
[Erica] Right.

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.247
Okay, Abrams. What kind of trees
are these saplings?

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.352
Malus Domestica Braeburn.

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:48.223
And what's the only orchard
in Julian, that grows Braeburns?

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:49.357
Bly's orchard.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:52.359
[car engine starts, revs]

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.566

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.256
[grunts]

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.663

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.216
[Brian screaming]

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:58.860
[Brian screams, sobs]

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:01.963
[screams]

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:14.576
[Abrams sighs]

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.314
[Erica] Whoa.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.796
[tapping]

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.397
- [Brian muffled] George.
- [leaves rustling]

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.666
[Brian muffled] Help me.

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:41.369
George!

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:43.972

[Brian muffled]
No.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:21.476
[whimpering]

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:30.451

[pants, grunts]

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:47.902
It's okay, Brian.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.971
George. Georgie.

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:51.939
This is how it's supposed to be.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.008
[panting]

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:57.645
[sighs]

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.516
You know, Nadine...

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.385
we were just...

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:08.356
distractions from her pathetic,

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:09.991
meaningless life.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.096
We were never supposed
to be with her.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:17.932
[Brian] Georgie.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:19.767
I'm your family.

01:12:19.769 --> 01:12:21.502
I am your family.
I am your big brother.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.037
[Brian] And you're
my little brother, George.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:24.505
And we're all we got.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.907
Hey. Hey.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:28.810
We're all we got.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.514
[Brian] We got to...

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.650
We got to stick together
so that we can be strong,

01:12:35.652 --> 01:12:37.885
so we can survive.

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:40.388
Look, he's using you, Georgie.
He's using you.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:42.423
And now, I want you to untie me.

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.659
[Brian] Georgie. Georgie.

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:45.860
Untie me.

01:12:48.565 --> 01:12:49.764
Untie me.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:52.900
[gasps]

01:12:52.902 --> 01:12:54.836

No! No!

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:57.105
[Brian panting]

01:12:58.641 --> 01:12:59.707
Shut up.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:03.544
- [James] George.
- [Brian groaning]

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:06.581
Would you be so kind
as to bring the shovel?

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.084
[Brian muffled]
George!

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:12.553
George!

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:14.522
Fuck!

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:21.746
[groans]

01:13:21.747 --> 01:13:22.529
[James] I know
what you're thinking.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.665
Hm.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.936
The Phantom and his opera.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.541
[chuckles]
No.

01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:36.644
It's not for me.

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:38.646
[James] I don't even like
classical music.

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:40.648
No.

01:13:42.819 --> 01:13:43.885
It's for you.

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:47.188
It's for all of you.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.992
A clarion's call.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:53.027
[James] For an usher
to the other side.

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:56.864
[Brian grunting]

01:13:56.866 --> 01:13:58.199
Hey, hey, hey.

01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:59.467
- Hey.
- [Brian groans]

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:02.570
George knows.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.140
- See...
- [Brian grunting]

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.044
George is the only one of you
who wrote me

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.747
while I was away.

01:14:12.749 --> 01:14:14.048

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:19.053
[James] See, I knew...

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.855
I knew that his suffering...

01:14:22.725 --> 01:14:23.991
was your suffering.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.697
- [James] My dear Brian.
- [Brian growling]

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:31.499
[James] Sweet Brian.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:33.868
I failed you.

01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:38.139
I failed all of you.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.074
- [James] But, hey...
- [Brian grunting]

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:43.611
- Hey!
- [Brian groaning]

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:45.880
It starts with...

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:48.082
with one single sore.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:52.920
- [Brian whimpers]
- [Erica] Whitley!

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:54.155
- [gunshot]
- [James] Ah!

01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:59.126
Oh, my god. Oh, Brian.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:01.629
[panting]

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:04.632

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:08.503

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:09.804
- [Brian grunts]
- [Erica] Oh, my god.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.742
- [Brian gasps]
- Are you all right?

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.544
- [Erica] Are you okay?
- Matt?

01:15:17.146 --> 01:15:18.246
Matt!

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:22.283
- [Brian] No. No.
- I'm so sorry.

01:15:22.285 --> 01:15:23.952
- You gotta go get him.
- [Erica] I'm sorry.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.620
- You're gonna be all right?
- I'm okay.

01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:27.054
[Abrams] I got Larson.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:28.523
Are you all right?

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.057
- You all right? You need help?
- [Brian sighs]

01:15:30.059 --> 01:15:31.125
- Hold on.
- [Brian] Help me up.

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.226
- [Abrams grunts]
- [Brian groans]

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:07.955
I almost saved them all.

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:12.259
[James] You'll never save them.

01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:15.162

- [zipper rasps]
- [paramedic] No, he's okay.

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:46.260
Something did knock him out
for a while.

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:48.396
- Could be the sodium pentothal.
- [Erica] Meaning?

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:49.864
[paramedic]
It's part of the cocktail.

01:17:49.866 --> 01:17:51.198
[Erica] He's gonna be all right?

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.266
[paramedic] Yeah.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:54.402
- Absolutely.
- Excuse me.

01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:55.770
[Erica] Thank god.

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:56.837
[Abrams] Thanks.

01:17:59.142 --> 01:18:01.442
Parker wants this area swept
and everything cataloged.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:03.144
The thing is,

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.845
the Feds are taking over
on anything involving Whitley.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:07.214
You know, I have, uh,

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.083
- theory on all of this.
- Abrams.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:13.854
You know what, I'll let you know
how it pans out.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:15.756
Thanks.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:19.286
You're too late.

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:21.455
Pardon?

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:24.825
I already gave my statement
to another detective.

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:26.961
Oh, no. I, um...
