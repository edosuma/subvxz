00:06.007 --> 00:08.623
( chickens clucking )

00:11.762 --> 00:13.673
Don't look so worried.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.384
It's my job.

00:15.558 --> 00:18.174
No, it's not.
You're a housewife.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.518
Yeah, punk?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.189
You see my house
around here?

00:24.233 --> 00:25.689
Housewife.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.228
( cheeping )

00:31.407 --> 00:33.113
They don't have a mother.

00:33.284 --> 00:35.616
She might be
somewhere else.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.742
Maybe she got eaten.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.869
Everything is food
for something else.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.577
- ( leg cracks )
- ( squawking loudly)

01:29.423 --> 01:31.254
( leg cracks )

01:57.451 --> 02:00.193
(growling)

02:07.420 --> 02:09.456
( clucking )

02:09.630 --> 02:11.040
( snarls )

02:14.260 --> 02:17.548
( bones cracking )

02:17.722 --> 02:20.338
(theme music playing )

03:02.016 --> 03:04.098
Could you be more obvious?

03:06.604 --> 03:07.969
Here, enjoy.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.887
Are you trying to buy
my silence with fruit?

03:10.066 --> 03:12.773
Of course not.
There's also jerky.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.650
Will you please tell me why your dad
has a secret barn full of walkers?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.402
- lt's creepy.
- Shh.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.029
- You know that, right?
- Shh.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.736
Just trust me
on this, okay?

03:20.910 --> 03:22.696
But I suck at lying.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.031
I can't even play poker.
It's too much like lying.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.821
You have to keep this
to yourself.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.741
You have to. Please.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.878
Dale, here's some
peaches for you.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.668
Mm, thank you.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.462
- Morning.
- Andrea: Morning.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.549
- 'Sup?
- Nothing.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.719
Nothing's up.
Why?

04:01.951 --> 04:04.658
Hey.

04:04.829 --> 04:07.946
This is not
that great, but...

04:11.627 --> 04:13.709
What, no pictures?

04:13.879 --> 04:16.256
I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.380
Yeah, you and me both.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.212
I don't expect you
to forgive me,

04:20.386 --> 04:22.752
but if there's
anything I can do...

04:22.930 --> 04:24.841
You were trying
to protect the group.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.926
We're good.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.595
But, hey,

04:33.774 --> 04:36.891
shoot me again,
you'd best pray I'm dead.

04:43.909 --> 04:45.991
What did Rick say?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.115
You didn't tell him?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.121
Okay.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.828
But you have to.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.958
You're pregnant.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.246
You need vitamins, medicine,
a nice pillow.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.384
You can have my share.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.637
Honey, I don't want
your food, okay? Eat.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.549
You need to eat.
You're too skinny.

05:09.727 --> 05:13.265
And if you're not gonna let Rick take
care of you, then someone has to.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.481
Lori, you have
a medical condition.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.362
I'll make another run into town.
Just tell me what you need.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.864
I need you to be quiet
about this.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.151
All right? Please.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.196
( Shane whistles )
Hey! Peach man.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.213
The creek flows south,
past that farmhouse Daryl found.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.998
Maybe Sophia dropped
the doll there,

05:43.177 --> 05:44.713
the current
brought it downstream.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.754
So what, you think she took this road
here and then she went north?

05:47.932 --> 05:49.092
Yeah.
What's up that way?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.676
A housing development.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.182
It went in
maybe 10 years ago.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.843
Take a run up there
after gun practice.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.262
l'll hold down the fort here,
but take backup.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.271
After what went down
with Daryl,

05:58.442 --> 06:00.603
I don't want anyone going out alone.
We stay in pairs.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.314
I'll take suggestions
on a partner.

06:02.488 --> 06:05.605
See how they do on the range,
then take your pick.

06:09.662 --> 06:11.323
Thanks.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.462
My binoculars.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.919
Yeah, yeah.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.548
Okay, bye.

06:35.271 --> 06:38.058
We'd like to join you
for gun training today.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.722
Hershel's been very clear.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.232
I can't involve any of you in what
we do without his okay.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.735
He doesn't like it,
but he consented.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.897
Otis was the only one
who knew guns.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.485
Now that he's gone,

06:49.660 --> 06:51.491
we gotta learn
to protect ourselves.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.869
Her father saw
the sense in that.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.122
No offense, but I'll ask
Hershel myself.

06:57.293 --> 07:00.626
Dude, nice lid, man.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.253
What's going on?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.919
I want to learn
to shoot, too.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.335
- Can you teach me?
- ( chuckles )

07:09.513 --> 07:13.756
Well, man, that's--
that's up to your parents.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.767
Can you talk to them?
They'll listen to you.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.973
( chuckles )

07:20.441 --> 07:22.432
We'll see, okay?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.895
- ( clicking )
- Hey.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.609
Let me see what
you've got there.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.830
Come on.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.041
How the hell
did this happen?

07:42.212 --> 07:46.330
Well, it's my fault.
I let him into the RV.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.921
He said he wanted a walkie,
that you sent him for one.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.632
So on top of everything else,
he lied.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.011
What's he thinking?

07:56.185 --> 07:58.767
He wants to learn how to shoot.
He asked me to teach him.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.223
Now it's none of
my business,

08:01.398 --> 08:03.810
but I'm happy to do it.
It's your call.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.020
Well, I'm not
comfortable with it.

08:08.489 --> 08:09.820
(sighs)

08:09.990 --> 08:13.528
Oh, don't make me out to be
the unreasonable one here. Rick?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.079
I know.
I have my concerns too, but--

08:16.246 --> 08:18.202
There's no but.
He was just shot.

08:18.374 --> 08:21.207
He's just back on his feet
and he wants a gun?

08:21.377 --> 08:23.368
Better than him
being afraid of 'em.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.376
There are guns in camp
for a reason.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.378
He should learn
to handle them safely.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.380
I don't want my kid
walking around with a gun.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.711
How can you
defend that?

08:30.886 --> 08:32.922
You can't let him go around
without protection.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.509
He's as safe as
he'll ever be right here.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.548
Look, everything
you're saying

08:37.726 --> 08:40.183
makes perfect sense.
It feels wrong.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.185
I mean,
I didn't feel good

08:42.356 --> 08:44.221
about him following you
out into the woods.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.561
And lwish l'd said something.
I should've gone with my gut.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.521
He's growing up,
thank God.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.403
We've got to start treating him
more like an adult.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.983
Then he needs
to act like one.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.989
He's not mature enough
to handle a gun.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.071
I'm not gonna
play with it, Mom.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.406
It's not a toy.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.865
I'm sorry
I disappointed you,

09:00.040 --> 09:01.780
but I want to look
for Sophia.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.120
I want to defend
our camp.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.704
I can't do that
without a gun.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.211
Shane's the best
instructor I know.

09:08.382 --> 09:12.091
I've seen him teach kids
younger than Carl.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.099
You will take this seriously

09:25.274 --> 09:26.730
and you will
behave responsibly.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.231
And if I hear from anyone
in this camp

09:28.402 --> 09:30.393
that you are not living up
to our expectations--

09:30.571 --> 09:32.061
He won't let you down.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.400
Yeah.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.737
Now if we're gonna do this,
you listen to Shane.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.246
- Okay, Dad.
- All right?

09:43.417 --> 09:45.328
- You be careful.
- You coming?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.118
I gotta help Dale clean
the spark plugs on the RV.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.628
He said he's gonna
teach me mechanics.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.254
I should probably go
look for him.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.791
- You found me.
- ( car engine starts)

09:56.597 --> 09:58.713
He's a good learner.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.071
Spark plugs, huh?

10:20.245 --> 10:22.031
Want to tell me
what's going on?

10:23.624 --> 10:24.989
You're old.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.579
You're-- you know things.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.291
So what if somebody
told you something

10:31.465 --> 10:34.707
that somebody else
should know--?

10:34.885 --> 10:36.967
Glenn, stop being dramatic.
Spit it out.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.806
There's-- there's walkers
in the barn

10:39.973 --> 10:41.474
and Lori's pregnant.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.059
(gunfire)

10:53.111 --> 10:55.067
Hey, come on, man.
Don't give me that gangsta shit.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.984
Attaboy.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.529
Don't be discouraged.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.243
You'll hit the target
eventually.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.794
Who says I didn't hit
my target?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.510
You get better balance,
twice the rounds.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.400
I'd say she's got
the hang of it.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.782
I'd say she's ready
for the advanced class.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.783
It might be
worth your while

11:43.954 --> 11:45.535
after the rest of us
head back to camp.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.866
Sure. Why not?

11:48.083 --> 11:51.166
- How's it feeling?
- I like the weight.

11:51.336 --> 11:54.669
So you decided
not to leave us.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.501
Something change your mind?

12:01.972 --> 12:04.008
- Got it.
- That's a great shot.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.815
Nervous Nelly.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.316
She find her way home?

12:20.490 --> 12:23.573
Found her in her stall
this morning.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.665
I love your fields.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.714
Took a long walk
this morning.

12:39.885 --> 12:44.174
I ended up by the barn.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.345
I heard the moans.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.010
That's unfortunate.

12:52.189 --> 12:55.181
I'm sure you have your reasons
for keeping this a secret.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.021
I saw the broadcasts
before they stopped,

12:58.195 --> 13:01.278
saw the irrational fear,
the atrocities,

13:01.448 --> 13:04.064
like the incident
at my well.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.948
We put down a walker.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.452
You killed a person.

13:09.623 --> 13:13.662
Well, if you watched
the same broadcasts I did,

13:13.835 --> 13:16.793
you saw walkers attack, kill.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.125
They're dangerous.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.676
A paranoid schizophrenic
is dangerous, too.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.629
We don't shoot
sick people.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.886
With all due respect,

13:26.056 --> 13:29.423
you are cut off
from the outside world here.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.432
But I've seen people
that I cared about

13:31.603 --> 13:34.219
die and come back,

13:34.398 --> 13:37.310
and they're not people.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.817
My wife and stepson

13:40.988 --> 13:43.024
are in that barn.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.486
They're people.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.822
I'm sorry.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.490
Let me help.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.001
l'll speak to Rick.
He's a good man.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.708
We can make the barn more secure,
keep everybody safe.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.249
The barn is secure.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.965
Keep this to yourself
if you want to help.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.755
Rick is a man of conscience,

14:09.933 --> 14:14.017
but are you so sure about
everyone in your group?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.148
Afternoon.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.036
I take it your boy did well.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.958
Not bad, actually.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.210
Be grateful you don't
have a daughter.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.213
If only things were as simple
as wanting to shoot.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.624
Carl's getting that chance,
thanks to you.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.963
And I'm eternally grateful

14:48.138 --> 14:50.504
for what you did
and your hospitality.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.593
We'll earn our keep.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.181
I appreciate that,
but with Carl getting better,

14:56.354 --> 14:58.219
I imagine you'll be
moving on soon--

15:00.525 --> 15:03.392
Fort Benning, I hear.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.873
(gunshot)

15:23.131 --> 15:25.338
- Still a virgin.
- The target's too small.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.295
Come on, that's crap.
Half-hour ago

15:27.469 --> 15:29.209
I saw you nail
a bull's-eye at 25 feet.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.593
It wasn't moving.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.675
You think a walker's
gonna hold still for you?

15:32.849 --> 15:34.589
Focus and reload,
go again.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.523
Uh-oh, did I piss you off?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.433
Come on, girl, you've got
walkers all around you.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.523
They're the woods.
They're in the RV.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.278
You're gonna need more
than a damn screwdriver.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.065
- Stop badgering me.
- You're too damn emotional.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.485
You need to shut it down.
Take all that guilt,

15:54.663 --> 15:56.449
take that fear,
that being pissed off, take it out.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.909
Right, 'cause you're so calm.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.450
See that?
See, I can be pissed off.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.539
I could be whistling "Dixie"
and I'll always hit the target.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.955
But you, God, you shoot
like a damn girl.

16:08.385 --> 16:09.966
You stand here
and you point your weapon.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.798
Point like you point your finger.
Do not think about it.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.587
I'm talking about
muscle memory, girl--

16:13.765 --> 16:15.096
muscle memory.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.599
Now go on, shoot that
son of a bitch.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.805
He's coming for you!
He's 10 feet away!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.516
He's nine feet--
he's five feet away!

16:21.690 --> 16:23.021
Right there, that's
the walker that got Amy.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.477
Now you shoot that son of a bitch!
Shoot him!

16:45.547 --> 16:48.289
Hershel expects us
to leave?

16:52.012 --> 16:54.003
Does anybody else know?

16:55.182 --> 16:57.423
Not yet.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.052
- Were you gonna tell me?
- Of course.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.016
When? How long
have you known?

17:04.191 --> 17:06.853
Not long. You don't need
to worry about this.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.109
How can you expect me not to worry?
We have shelter here

17:09.279 --> 17:11.611
and food and water
and medical care.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.193
I've been talking with Hershel.
It's not carved in stone.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.982
He thinks it is.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.697
We have to fix this.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.203
People are settling in here.
They'll be devastated.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.704
I know.
I'm working on it.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.365
Maybe I can talk to him, too,
and plead our case.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.204
No, things are uneasy.
The best thing right now

17:25.378 --> 17:27.790
is to give Hershel
some space.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.627
Don't look at me like that.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.632
Like what?

17:33.803 --> 17:35.668
Like you're scared.
Like you don't trust me.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.054
I can take it from everyone
else, but not from you.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.341
I don't understand
how you could keep

17:40.518 --> 17:43.885
something like this
from me.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.147
Carl's barely on his feet.
And Sophia's missing.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.979
And Daryl and T-Dog are hurt.
How can we leave?

17:50.153 --> 17:52.565
It's not what I want either,
but if we have to go,

17:52.739 --> 17:54.946
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure

17:55.116 --> 17:56.856
you and Carl are okay.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.777
We'll get by.
We will.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.244
Okay.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.049
Come on,
let me give you a lift.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.340
My feet work just fine.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.066
Look, I'm just trying
to get you rattled,

18:36.241 --> 18:38.277
give you an idea

18:38.451 --> 18:40.237
what it's like when
the shit starts to fly.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.027
Is that an apology?

18:42.205 --> 18:45.197
I crossed the line
when I brought Amy into it.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.082
Yeah, it's an apology.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.369
You're a real dick
sometimes.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.663
Yeah, I acknowledge that.
I'll tell you what:

18:52.841 --> 18:56.584
I've got a lead on Sophia.
I'm gonna go check it out.

18:56.761 --> 19:00.174
Why don't you come with me,
be my backup?

19:05.854 --> 19:07.469
Come on.

19:49.022 --> 19:51.684
My wife was
pregnant once.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.774
She miscarried

19:54.944 --> 19:57.526
and we didn't try again
after that.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.526
I'm so sorry.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.531
The thing
that I remember most

20:02.702 --> 20:05.193
is how nauseated
she became

20:05.372 --> 20:08.034
at the smell
of cooking meat.

20:09.334 --> 20:12.201
And she was
a meat-eating gal-- my wife,

20:12.379 --> 20:15.542
but with the pregnancy...

20:15.715 --> 20:17.876
That Thanksgiving,

20:18.051 --> 20:20.133
the turkey--

20:20.303 --> 20:23.795
she couldn't be
in the house

20:23.973 --> 20:26.225
for two days until
it was aired out,

20:26.393 --> 20:27.724
poor thing.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.885
Glenn told you?

20:30.063 --> 20:33.305
What did you expect?
The boy has no guile.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.728
I haven't told Rick.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.736
I can't.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.398
Because of Shane?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.736
Was it that obvious?

20:44.911 --> 20:47.072
No, no, I don't
think anyone knew.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.954
I didn't, not for sure.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.741
Look, I thought
my husband was dead.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.579
And I felt like
I'd died with him.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.418
And |--

20:59.592 --> 21:02.504
I wanted to feel
something-- anything.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.671
And now I hate myself for it.

21:06.850 --> 21:09.216
And the baby?

21:09.394 --> 21:11.225
lt's Rick's.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.603
None of the rest
of it matters.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.606
Then what's your concern?

21:16.776 --> 21:19.108
Memories are
what keep me going now.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.941
Memories of what life
used to be.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.946
And |--

21:24.117 --> 21:25.823
I've got a deep well
to draw on.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.655
I still rememberjoy.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.616
But I think Carl's well
is already running dry.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.530
And this baby--

21:32.709 --> 21:34.370
the baby won't have
any good memories at all,

21:34.544 --> 21:36.956
only fear and pain.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.462
You can't think like that.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.540
We can still find joy

21:42.719 --> 21:45.802
and we can still take
strength from each other.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.088
Do you really think
this baby has a chance,

21:48.266 --> 21:51.303
that it could grow up
and live a happy life?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.810
Look me in the eye
and tell me

21:53.980 --> 21:57.347
that my baby will grow up
to be your age

21:57.525 --> 22:00.733
and die happy.

22:00.904 --> 22:04.943
Tell me.
Tell me you believe that.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.296
I'm sorry. |'m-- itjust came out.
And it was Dale.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.337
It's okay. I never should have
put you in that position.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.803
I've been thinking
about what you said

22:31.976 --> 22:33.887
about needing help.

22:34.062 --> 22:36.144
And you're right that I do.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.975
Name it. Yeah.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.980
If you're still willing to make
a run into town for me...

22:40.151 --> 22:41.561
I'm your man.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.523
Thank you.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.405
It's okay.
It's not a big deal really.

22:55.625 --> 22:57.536
Glenn:
You didn't have to come.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.292
You could hate me
from a distance.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.377
Please say something.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.512
- Maggie, |--
- | asked for your trust

23:15.687 --> 23:19.225
and you betrayed it.
Now my dad's pissed at me.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.065
Yourturn.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.315
So your dad thinks
they're sick?

23:29.492 --> 23:31.073
You agree with that,

23:31.244 --> 23:33.906
even after what you saw
at the well?

23:34.080 --> 23:35.911
I'm not sure what I saw
at the well.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.073
Yes, you are.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.380
Look, if you'd seen Atlanta,

23:43.548 --> 23:45.209
you would not have
a barn full of walkers.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.419
| wish you'd stop
calling them that.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.590
What do you call them?

23:51.764 --> 23:53.595
Mom,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.427
Shawn,

23:55.602 --> 23:59.265
Mr. and Mrs. Fischer,
Lacey, Duncan.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.731
What does she want now?

24:07.905 --> 24:09.406
I can't say.

24:13.536 --> 24:16.528
So when one of them asks you
to keep your mouth shut...

24:18.124 --> 24:20.365
Crawl out of my butt

24:20.543 --> 24:22.534
and help me look, please.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.548
You've got to be kidding me.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.176
-(snaﬂs)
- Help!

25:13.346 --> 25:15.632
Glenn, help!

25:15.807 --> 25:17.263
Oh, God!

25:17.433 --> 25:20.516
- Maggie!
- Glenn, help me!

25:20.687 --> 25:24.305
Help! Glenn!

25:24.482 --> 25:27.189
Get it off me!
Help!

25:36.077 --> 25:37.567
Did it get you?
Did it bite you?

25:37.745 --> 25:40.077
(sobbing )

25:42.792 --> 25:44.032
Glenn!

25:55.388 --> 25:57.629
(Glenn grunting)

26:04.021 --> 26:06.683
( panting )

26:49.942 --> 26:52.024
We're gonna have to go
house to house.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.777
We'll start at the far end
and we'll work our way back.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.563
lf Sophia got this far,
she has a real shot,

26:57.742 --> 26:59.232
don't you think?

27:02.830 --> 27:04.491
Maggie:
Hey! We got your stuff.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.496
Maggie, hang on, please.

27:06.667 --> 27:09.659
- Come on in here.
- Why? Nothing to hide.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.122
We got your
special delivery right here.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.504
We got your lotion,
got your conditioner,

27:13.674 --> 27:15.881
- your "Soap Opera Digest."
- Maggie.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.633
Next time you want something,
get it your damn self.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.170
- We're not your errand boys.
- Honey, |--

27:21.265 --> 27:24.007
And here's your
abortion pills.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.695
- That was not cool.
- Which part?

27:41.869 --> 27:44.281
The part where that bitch
almost got us killed?

27:46.582 --> 27:47.913
lshould've gone alone.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.699
If you want to blame
anybody, blame me.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.913
Right, take the blame.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.921
You know, for a smart guy,
you're really stupid.

27:55.091 --> 27:58.003
Okay, I'm confused,

27:58.177 --> 28:00.793
because I think you just paid me
a compliment, but you made it s--

28:08.729 --> 28:10.560
I've already lost
three of the people

28:10.731 --> 28:12.107
that I care about most
in this world.

28:12.275 --> 28:14.186
- Maggie--
- Shut up.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.817
You're smart.
You're brave.

28:16.988 --> 28:18.979
You're a leader.
But you don't know it.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.566
And your friends
don't want to know it.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.073
They'd rather have you
fetching peaches.

28:23.244 --> 28:25.610
There's a dead guy in the well?
Send Glenn down.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.369
You're walker bait.

28:27.540 --> 28:30.532
I can't take you
becoming one of them.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.384
Sophia?

28:42.555 --> 28:44.216
Anyone?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.130
Shane:
Shh,shh,shh.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.679
Sophia?

29:05.411 --> 29:07.527
They walled off
the hallway?

29:07.705 --> 29:11.118
Theytﬁed
to make a stand here.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.141
Sophia?

29:40.404 --> 29:42.565
(flies buzzing )

30:06.430 --> 30:08.386
She was never here,

30:08.557 --> 30:10.548
was she?

30:12.645 --> 30:15.136
I don't know how to tell Carol
this was another dead end.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.600
(walkers snarling )

30:17.775 --> 30:19.265
Come on, let's move.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.783
Cover that street.
I'll clear the car.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.319
( gunshots)

30:42.299 --> 30:44.756
- ( gun clicks)
- Oh, shit.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.056
Focus now.
Clear the jam. Focus.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.946
- Are you kidding me?
- I got your back. Now go.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.028
-(snaﬂs)
-(gunshot)

31:19.879 --> 31:22.621
Andrea, Andrea, let's go.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.504
Come on.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.546
Andrea, come on.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.561
The blood
on Maggie's shirt--

31:47.740 --> 31:49.901
She was attacked.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.782
Are you guys all right?
How bad was it?

31:53.621 --> 31:54.861
It was pretty close.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.404
I'm so sorry.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.243
I should never have
asked you to go.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.157
I offered.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.873
I thought the town was safe,
but if you hadn't come back--

32:03.047 --> 32:05.663
But we did.
I always do.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.099
The morning-after pills--
will they even work?

32:14.266 --> 32:16.473
I don't know.

32:17.812 --> 32:19.552
I don't know
if I want them to.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.221
Then I got these, too,

32:22.399 --> 32:24.390
just in case.

32:31.242 --> 32:33.574
Prenatal vitamins.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.408
That's a hell of a choice.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.664
I'm glad it's not mine.

32:44.880 --> 32:48.714
Lori, we're friends,
aren't we?

32:48.884 --> 32:52.297
With everything
we've been through, yeah.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.427
I can't tell you
what to do.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.305
I could never tell you
something like that.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.971
But your choice--

33:03.149 --> 33:06.312
maybe you shouldn't
make it alone.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.845
Come on, then.

33:40.019 --> 33:43.182
Get over here.
Get over here.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.941
( horn honks)

33:51.530 --> 33:54.146
( stifled sobs )

34:21.393 --> 34:23.384
(whimpering)

34:26.065 --> 34:28.056
( panting )

34:42.414 --> 34:44.325
(gags)

35:10.985 --> 35:12.100
Anything?

35:12.278 --> 35:14.564
Not today.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.114
I'm so sorry.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.113
We'll cover
more ground tomorrow.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.693
What happened out there?

35:22.871 --> 35:25.613
Um, I--

35:25.791 --> 35:27.702
- The place was overrun.
- Yeah.

35:30.754 --> 35:33.006
Let's go get you cleaned up.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.434
-Shane,Shane.
-Hmm?

35:44.601 --> 35:46.557
lwas thinking,

35:46.729 --> 35:48.435
you've got that
nice new ride of yours,

35:48.605 --> 35:51.597
plenty of fuel, more than enough
for you to get far from here.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.606
What, you telling me
to leave?

35:53.777 --> 35:55.438
I know you've been
planning to.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.694
Maybe now is a good time.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.981
Is this about Andrea?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.317
I'm looking out
for the group.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.157
You think the group would be
better off without me, Dale?

36:06.332 --> 36:08.573
Why don't you tell that
to Rick or Lori?

36:08.751 --> 36:11.083
Their boy would be dead
if I hadn't put my ass on the line.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.459
And Otis's.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.582
You've been vague about that night,
about what happened.

36:22.097 --> 36:23.633
Otis died a hero.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.183
So you've said.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.763
A little boy lived because of what
went down that night.

36:27.936 --> 36:30.268
I think you ought
to show some gratitude.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.475
- I wasn't there.
- No, man, you weren't.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.981
But I was the time that you
raised your gun on Rick.

36:35.152 --> 36:37.609
- Come on. Jesus.
- You had him in your sights

36:37.780 --> 36:39.270
and you held him there.

36:42.910 --> 36:46.368
I know what kind of man
you are.

36:50.376 --> 36:53.368
You think I'd shoot Rick?

36:55.005 --> 36:56.836
That is my best friend.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.668
That's the man that I love.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.049
I love him like
he's my brother.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.552
You think that's
the kind of man I am?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.053
That's right.

37:05.224 --> 37:07.180
Well, maybe we ought
to just think that through.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.182
Say I'm the kind of man

37:09.353 --> 37:11.719
who'd gun down
his own best friend.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.855
What do you think I'd do
to some guy that I don't even like

37:15.025 --> 37:17.437
when he starts throwing
accusations my way?

37:17.611 --> 37:19.602
What do you think?

38:26.972 --> 38:29.588
Is there something
you need to tell me?

38:30.934 --> 38:33.220
We can't leave.
I'm pregnant.

38:33.395 --> 38:35.477
Are you?

38:36.773 --> 38:38.809
I threw them up.

38:45.449 --> 38:47.610
You can yell if you want.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.908
You can scream
if you have to,

38:51.079 --> 38:53.070
but talk to me.

38:55.042 --> 38:57.454
How long have you known?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.338
Does it matter?

39:02.549 --> 39:06.588
Days? Weeks?
And you didn't tell me?

39:06.762 --> 39:08.423
- I'm telling you now.
- No.

39:08.597 --> 39:12.636
I found these.
So Glenn knows, right?

39:12.809 --> 39:16.301
Instead of coming to me,
you sent him to get pills?

39:16.480 --> 39:19.438
I panicked. You tell me we have
no roof and no walls--

39:19.608 --> 39:22.315
Do not put this on me!

39:22.486 --> 39:25.398
You tear into me for keeping secrets
when you're holding onto this?

39:25.572 --> 39:27.403
You want me to bring
a baby into this?

39:27.574 --> 39:29.656
To live a short,
cruel life?

39:29.826 --> 39:31.691
How can you think
like that?

39:31.870 --> 39:34.111
We can't even protect
the son we already have.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.496
So this is the solution?

39:36.667 --> 39:39.033
Rick, I threw them up.

39:40.087 --> 39:42.043
I screwed up.

39:42.214 --> 39:46.833
I don't know
how we do this.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.397
We can make it work.

40:02.568 --> 40:06.060
How? Tell me how.

40:06.238 --> 40:10.072
We'll figure it out.
Shouldn't we try to figure it out?

40:10.242 --> 40:13.234
You threw up the pills.

40:13.412 --> 40:15.494
You want this baby.
I know you do.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.370
Not like this.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.907
Not giving birth
in a ditch.

40:20.085 --> 40:23.373
Not when its life
will hang by a thread

40:23.547 --> 40:25.538
from the second it's born.

40:25.716 --> 40:28.128
Not when every cry
will put it,

40:28.302 --> 40:31.044
and Carl, and everyone
we care about, into danger.

40:31.221 --> 40:32.597
That's not right.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.756
Not even giving it a chance
isn't right either.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.515
Maybe this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

40:37.686 --> 40:41.395
|sti||-- I still
don't understand why.

40:41.565 --> 40:45.433
You really think I'd make you
have a baby you don't want?

40:45.611 --> 40:48.819
No, so that if I
went through with it,

40:48.989 --> 40:52.106
it would be on my
conscience and not yours.

40:52.284 --> 40:56.744
Maybe that's true,

40:56.913 --> 40:59.620
but I can't live
like this anymore,

40:59.791 --> 41:02.874
Lori.

41:03.045 --> 41:05.752
We can't live like this.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.756
Is there anything else

41:09.926 --> 41:12.178
I should know about?

41:20.812 --> 41:23.098
Shane and I.

41:29.946 --> 41:33.734
I know.
Of course I know.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.199
You thought I was dead.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.748
The world went to shit
and you thought I was dead.

41:50.926 --> 41:52.962
Right?

42:02.688 --> 42:04.679
Yeah.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.531
