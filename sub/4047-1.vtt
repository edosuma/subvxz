I listened--
I listened the "goodest."

01:33:06.749 --> 01:33:08.751
I don't wanna do it anymore.

01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:10.653
One more time.
Last one and you're outta here.

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:15.123
[ frog croaking ]
Cut! Cut! Cut!

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:17.492
Somebody help me!
Help me!

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:20.395
Whoa!
Just for the record, Mom--

01:33:20.495 --> 01:33:23.331
Be careful, pally.
Slow down on that stuff.

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:24.733
You're not gonna remember
a damn thing in school

01:33:24.833 --> 01:33:28.170
if you suck 'em back
like I do.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.305
Now, on the end around
the guard pulls.

01:33:30.405 --> 01:33:34.843
That means you, Buttler.
Whoa.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.378
Cut!
[ all laughing ]

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:39.815
Action!
Frankly, I'm concerned.

01:33:39.915 --> 01:33:42.685
I go around those kids,
they start beatin' on me.

01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:44.953
What if I get a black eye?
[ laughs ]

01:33:45.053 --> 01:33:49.391
Frankly, I'm concerned, honey.
The kids set me on fire,
they beat me.

01:33:50.693 --> 01:33:52.560
They're abusive.
[ laughing ]

01:33:52.695 --> 01:33:55.263
This is how I get jobs,
right here!

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:57.866
I'm sorry. I looked
at myself in the camera.

01:33:57.966 --> 01:34:00.102
I'm so-- good-looking.
They set me on fire!

01:34:00.202 --> 01:34:01.569
Sounds good to me.

01:34:01.704 --> 01:34:03.571
All the kids
wrapped in duct tape.

01:34:03.706 --> 01:34:06.374
Maybe we can just roll,
roll ourselves in duct tape,

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.811
and then I can just
roll you across the floor.

01:34:08.911 --> 01:34:10.879
Together, maybe.

01:34:10.979 --> 01:34:13.015

you forgot *
