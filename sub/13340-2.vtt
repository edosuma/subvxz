WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:07.181
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

00:07.224 --> 00:09.487
- So what do think?
You got what it takes?

00:09.531 --> 00:11.185
- Do it, Beth.
Just shoot him.

00:11.228 --> 00:13.317
- I just want it to be over.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
- When's Dean-sy coming home?

00:16.233 --> 00:17.495
- Made all your favorites.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.671
- What happened
to the stop sign?

00:19.715 --> 00:21.282
- The things you did...

00:21.325 --> 00:22.587
Hand me those.
- Really?

00:22.631 --> 00:24.067
- Wanna act
like nothing's wrong?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.590
- I'm gonna leave Nancy.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.331
- I have a secret.
Nancy's pregs.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.159
- I'm going to take
these women down.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.074
- Yes.
I'm his key witness.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.468
- I can't go away for this.
What are you doing?

00:33.511 --> 00:35.731
- Well, a husband can't testify
against his wife.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.776
- Turns out
we got a mutual friend.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.256
He's talking to the Feds now.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.736
I'm going to need you
to take care of him.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.042
- That's insane.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.045
What is it?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.655
- What is it, Beth?

01:04.107 --> 01:05.413
- You had to bring it?

01:05.456 --> 01:07.197
- I wasn't going
to leave it at home.

01:07.241 --> 01:09.243
- All right.
Let me see it. Come on.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.115
- Careful.

01:14.813 --> 01:17.512
- Really?

01:17.555 --> 01:18.774
- Put it down.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.605
- All right.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.523
How's Tuesday?

01:30.394 --> 01:32.266
- Sara has
a doctor's appointment.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.792
Well, Wednesday I have Sadie.
Thursday?

01:38.446 --> 01:41.231
- I guess Thursday works.

01:42.754 --> 01:45.409
- Wanna whip out your iCal or--
- No!

01:45.453 --> 01:49.283
- You know, I'm just trying
to be proactive here, okay?

01:49.326 --> 01:51.459
Good news is,
we have the means.

01:51.502 --> 01:53.896
Now we just have
to find someone to do it.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.159
- I say we look
on the dark web.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.465
One "The First 48"
they always hire,

01:57.508 --> 01:59.423
like, a gym trainer
or something.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.860
- How do we get on that?
- I don't know.

02:01.904 --> 02:02.861
That's why it's called
the dark web.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.515
It's not meant for us.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.648
- Am I the only one
who doesn't want to do this?

02:06.691 --> 02:09.303
- No.
- He's a rapist.

02:09.346 --> 02:12.132
- He's a person.
- Who rapes.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.176
- God, I can't have
this conversation.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.264
I'm gonna be sick.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.922
Welcome to Dandy Donuts,
I'll be right with you.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.750
- It's 2 A.M.
Who needs a frickin' donut?

02:21.793 --> 02:23.578
- Why did he ask us to do it,
anyway?

02:24.622 --> 02:26.276
- To torture me.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.409
- Maybe if we wait
he'll get ants in his pants

02:28.452 --> 02:29.845
and he'll do it himself.

02:29.888 --> 02:33.240
- Yeah. Yeah, and then
he'll do the hokey pokey

02:33.283 --> 02:34.763
and he'll turn himself around

02:34.806 --> 02:36.721
and then you know
what he's gonna do?

02:36.765 --> 02:37.853
Us.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.160
- You know what this is?

02:41.335 --> 02:42.858
A gang initiation.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.773
- Son of a bitch.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.470
- Blood in, blood out.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.298
- Son of a bitch.

02:48.342 --> 02:50.474
- It's a thing.
Trust me.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.215
- Excuse me?

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
Can I order?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.661
- So then the doctor writes
the gender on a little slip

03:03.705 --> 03:06.360
of paper and you bring that
slip of paper to a bakery

03:06.403 --> 03:08.884
and they make a cake
that has either blue or pink--

03:08.927 --> 03:12.279
- Wow, hey.
Sadie! Chop chop.

03:12.322 --> 03:15.238
- I mean, obviously, who cares.
You just want a healthy baby,

03:15.282 --> 03:18.459
blah, blah, blah.
Did you do it naturally?

03:18.502 --> 03:22.506
- Uh, well, I pooped her out
in the bathroom at prom, so...

03:22.550 --> 03:24.204
Is she coming down or...

03:27.294 --> 03:29.992
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:33.648 --> 03:36.912
- Oh, uh,
did you get my message?

03:39.828 --> 03:40.916
- About what?

03:42.483 --> 03:45.268
- Uh, Sadie wants
to quit piano.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.530
- Mm.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.619
Well, I actually
think that's a good idea.

03:50.317 --> 03:53.450
- Well, I actually think
that she should stick it out.

03:53.494 --> 03:56.714
- Well, not if it's not
the right thing to do anymore.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.977
- You don't quit something just
because it starts to get hard.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.805
- Yeah, you can.

04:00.849 --> 04:03.286
Because sometimes it's just
the end of the road, Greg.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.636
Yeah,
and you got to deal with it.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.641
- How about if she finds
another instrument?

04:10.685 --> 04:12.730
- Yes, Nance gets it.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.993
- Can you please tell her
that she has to come?

04:15.037 --> 04:17.692
- Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, if...

04:17.735 --> 04:20.782
- Um, yeah.
You should... Come.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.349
- Good sell.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.524
You really should.

04:23.567 --> 04:24.960
You're the only other person

04:25.003 --> 04:27.745
on the planet who has been
here, you know?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
- Where's that?

04:29.834 --> 04:31.575
- Pregs with Gregs.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.404
- Sadie, please!

04:34.448 --> 04:36.580
- So, how is Sara doing?

04:36.624 --> 04:39.061
- Oh, she is way, way, better.
- Oh, goodness, so much better.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.758
- And what about you guys?

04:42.630 --> 04:43.892
- Is that a new Jesus?

04:43.935 --> 04:45.937
- Oh, yeah, yeah. You like him?

04:45.981 --> 04:48.375
- Yeah, word,
he's got the whole...

04:48.418 --> 04:50.942
- So, how are you doing?

04:50.986 --> 04:54.598
- God has put you two
through quite a bit.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.991
- Um...

04:58.820 --> 05:00.822
Well, you know the truth is
we've been having

05:00.865 --> 05:01.997
a rough go of it lately.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.348
- It's my fault.
I broke a vow.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.350
- More than one.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.961
- You were unfaithful?
- I wouldn't say that.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.964
- Why not? I mean,
you lied, you snuck around,

05:13.008 --> 05:15.097
you climbed in the bed with
a whole bunch of shady people.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.968
- Okay.
- Did things I would never do.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.753
- All right.
- This was betrayal, for sure.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.408
- And infidelity is one
of the biggest tests

05:21.451 --> 05:22.974
a marriage will face.

05:25.368 --> 05:29.851
- It's like I can feel
the distance and it's on me

05:29.894 --> 05:33.463
but...
I don't know how to fix it.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.424
- What do you think about
what Ruby just said?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.992
- I mean, listen, you know...

05:41.036 --> 05:44.126
I love her, she's the
mother of my children,

05:44.169 --> 05:48.348
she's my best friend--
- Ah, say it to her.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.576
- - You're my best friend.

05:59.620 --> 06:02.057
You're my road dog,
and honestly when I look at you

06:02.100 --> 06:05.016
right now,
I don't know who I married.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.546
- Is it over?

06:13.416 --> 06:14.504
- Is what over?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.593
- The affair.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.639
- Yeah, it's over.

06:19.727 --> 06:23.078
- God is good and he forgives,

06:23.121 --> 06:26.690
and in time Stan will, too.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.619
- Friend's giving his
deposition in the morning.

06:43.577 --> 06:44.882
- What the hell?

06:44.926 --> 06:46.667
He's not my friend.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.757
- So, how are you
going to do it?

06:56.981 --> 06:58.592
- I don't know.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.594
- Well maybe you should
figure that out, huh?

07:00.637 --> 07:03.031
- I can't just murder someone.
I'm not a psychopath.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.078
- Not easy being the boss, huh?

07:10.995 --> 07:13.084
- I need to pick
up my kids now.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
- Oh, yeah. You gotta hustle

07:14.782 --> 07:16.740
if you wanna make it
to Scouts, huh?

07:20.135 --> 07:21.789
- Do it tonight.

07:35.977 --> 07:39.807
- Did you see that shot?
That guy is incredible.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.593
- Can we watch "Minions" now?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.856
- It's the playoffs, my man.
Mm-mm.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.946
Oh, come on! Oh, my God.
Right there.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.948
- I want "Minions."

07:53.081 --> 07:55.692
- Now if I'm going to be
your Daddy, Son,

07:55.736 --> 07:57.651
you gotta learn to listen.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.488
- Listen to your Daddy, okay?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.756
- All right,
it's your lucky day.

08:15.799 --> 08:19.499
- Yay!
- I gotta run for a bit, okay?

08:19.542 --> 08:20.804
- Okay.

08:27.681 --> 08:28.725
-  Turner.

08:30.727 --> 08:31.859
Turner?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.652
- Jimmy?

08:42.696 --> 08:43.653
Jimbo?

08:43.697 --> 08:45.089
- Get on your knees.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.226
Oh, what is this?
"The Craft?"

08:51.269 --> 08:52.662
What are you going
to cast a spell on me?

08:52.706 --> 08:54.055
- Just get on your knees,
Boomer.

08:54.098 --> 08:56.187
- So you can shoot me
with a squirt gun?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.156
- Whoa.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.549
Okay, hey.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.160
- Just do it.

09:13.378 --> 09:14.858
- What's going on?

09:14.902 --> 09:16.251
- Don't let him talk.
Just do it.

09:17.948 --> 09:21.256
- No, please.
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.866
- Beth, pull the trigger.
- Hang on.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.302
- Shoot him now.
- No, please.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.174
- Beth, trust me.
Don't let him talk to you.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.959
Just shoot him.
- Come on. No, come on, please.

09:29.003 --> 09:33.137
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.096
Please.
Oh, God.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.230
- You are not going to give
that deposition.

09:39.274 --> 09:42.233
- What are you doing? Because
she's going to kill you! Beth!

09:42.277 --> 09:43.713
- You are ratting out a gang.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.672
You think they're going
to let you talk?

09:47.412 --> 09:49.066
- Wait,
who is going to kill me?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.241
You guys or the gang?

09:50.285 --> 09:52.113
- We are!
Beth, do it! Come on!

09:52.156 --> 09:53.244
What are you doing?

09:53.288 --> 09:54.289
Give me the gun,
give me the gun.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.812
- Annie.
- Ruby.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.379
- Make her give me
the gun right now.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.076
- I can't, I don't know what--I
can't help you.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.338
- Jesus, Ruby, come on.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.732
- Beth, pull the trigger.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.387
- So I'm gonna go now.

10:07.694 --> 10:08.869
- How much?

10:08.912 --> 10:10.218
Come on,
everyone's got a number.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.656
But you got to disappear
for good.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.269
- $20,000.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.794
- Oh, my God. Beth, come on.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.147
- Deal.
- Sweet Jesus.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.244
Well that's twice now.

10:46.950 --> 10:50.301
- No, it's a stop sign.
It's not damaged, it's missing,

10:50.345 --> 10:52.129
and we live on a street with,
like, a million kids,

10:52.173 --> 10:55.306
so you know somebody, somebody
is going to get killed.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.614
Where's the refrigerator?

10:59.963 --> 11:02.226
- The medical bills
alone are...

11:03.314 --> 11:05.447
Not to mention the mortgage.
- Why didn't you tell me?

11:07.362 --> 11:09.625
- Because you just
got out of surgery.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.497
- I can do something.
- What are you going to do?

11:12.541 --> 11:13.890
What are you
going to mow lawns?

11:13.934 --> 11:15.370
You can hardly even walk.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.724
And that's on me.

11:23.204 --> 11:26.381
So just let me figure it out,
okay?

11:27.643 --> 11:28.905
- Is that it?

11:28.949 --> 11:30.602
- I put the dishwasher
on Craigslist

11:30.646 --> 11:31.952
and I've got a lead
on the patio furniture.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.562
- That's not
what I'm talking about.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.696
It's about him, isn't it?

11:38.436 --> 11:40.351
- No.
- Have you talked to him?

11:40.395 --> 11:41.788
- No.
- Have you seen him?

11:41.831 --> 11:44.225
- No!

11:44.268 --> 11:46.880
I'm just trying
to keep us above water.

11:55.802 --> 12:00.894
- ♪ It's gonna take
a bit of work ♪

12:00.937 --> 12:03.723
♪ Oh-ho, work

12:06.900 --> 12:10.381
♪ Now that you're here

12:12.601 --> 12:15.691
♪ Whoa-ho, work

12:40.672 --> 12:42.849
I feel dirtier
than a truck stop ho.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.550
- And those late fees,
they're worse than an STD.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.555
- That's it?
- Are you for real?

12:53.598 --> 12:56.384
- Literally the only thing left
of value

12:56.427 --> 12:58.908
that I have are my eggs.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.606
- Okay, lets sell those.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.653
- Takes a full menstrual cycle,
but thanks.

13:07.047 --> 13:10.485
- Well, we're short.
- How much exactly?

13:11.747 --> 13:15.403
- $16,927.

13:16.447 --> 13:19.407
- Well, gotta go.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.410
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I got a party.

13:22.453 --> 13:26.936
- Seriously?
- Hey. I would have shot him.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.069
- I'm not sure I have the right
address here.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.767
I'm looking for
Leslie Peterson.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.334
- He's my fiancé.

13:34.422 --> 13:35.510
- Is he home?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.861
- No.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.820
- Will you tell him
Jimmy stopped by?

13:40.863 --> 13:43.518
With the FBI.
- He's right here.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.305
- Yeah, I've been a little
under the weather.

13:48.349 --> 13:49.698
- Dude.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.743
- You ever hear of IBS?
It's a chronic thing.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.702
It flares up.
- We had a deal.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.443
We're building a case, Leslie.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.054
Look, I just need
a couple of days.

13:58.098 --> 14:01.710
I swear. And then
I'll be back to regular.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.364
- Did they get to you?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.018
- Who?
- Come on, man.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.846
- Oh, no, come on.
No one got to me.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.544
- If somebody's trying to shake
you down I need to know.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.637
- It's just a condition.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.857
- So I'll get with the DA then?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.771
- Yeah.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.990
Let's do this.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.823
- Thank you everyone
for coming out tonight.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.825
I am so excited.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.047
Okay, so, how many people
think blue?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.092
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.877
How many people think pink?

14:39.487 --> 14:41.445
- How many don't give
a rat's ass?

14:41.489 --> 14:45.058
- Let's find out, okay?
- Yeah.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.017
- Let's go.
Take a deep breath, okay.

14:48.061 --> 14:52.500
Three, two, one.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.545
Oh, my gosh
I'm so nervous. I can't wait.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.025
Is it ready?
- Ah-huh.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.984
- It's a...

14:59.768 --> 15:01.422
wait, what is it?

15:01.465 --> 15:03.772
- I think it's kind of pink.
- No, it's nothing.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.861
It's nothing, it's marble.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.038
- Okay, uh...
- Great. Well, party ruined.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.822
- No, no, no, it's not. What
do you want me to do?

15:10.866 --> 15:12.433
I'll do anything.

15:12.476 --> 15:13.564
- I wanna know the sex
of the baby, Greg.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.044
- No, I--right.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.133
- Yowza.

15:17.177 --> 15:20.441
- What'd you get her?
- Oh, a bottle of wine.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.182
You?
- The Moo Mama,

15:22.225 --> 15:23.487
you know that pram?

15:23.531 --> 15:25.446
- Damn, aren't those like a G?

15:25.489 --> 15:27.100
- Oh, no,
I got her the good one.

- In someone else's purse?

16:01.482 --> 16:04.006
- If you must know.
- Sorry.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.095
- Just trying to keep
the mystery alive.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.749
That ship has sailed.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.011
- Really?
Like when?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.230
- Oh, I could tell you
exactly when.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.840
- When?

16:11.883 --> 16:14.103
- It was when you Dutch Oven'd
me in high school.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.192
You loved it.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.157
- Did you call?

16:25.680 --> 16:30.554
- Yeah, um, it's a boy.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.819
- Wow!
- Yeah.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.734
- You excited?

16:36.778 --> 16:37.997
- Yeah.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.043
But look,
this doesn't change anything

16:41.087 --> 16:44.133
about how I feel about us.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.917
- It changes everything.

16:53.012 --> 16:58.060
So, I'm gonna, um...I'm gonna
put this inside me now.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.193
- Yeah, just in there.

17:16.905 --> 17:21.083
- Okay, got your 17 grand
and then some.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.086
- The hell is that?
- It's a frick'n Tesla, dawg.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
Took it.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.918
- You stole a car?
- Oh, I didn't steal anything.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.921
- I'm not stealing
someone else's car.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.054
- Yeah, you're not shooting
anybody either, are you?

17:35.097 --> 17:37.230
- I made a decision
in the moment.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.797
- Well you made it for all
of us and guess what?

17:39.841 --> 17:41.060
It was the wrong one.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.891
- Take the keys.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.155
-  Okay. I'm sorry,
if you have another way

17:49.198 --> 17:51.331
of getting, like, 20 grand
by tomorrow then please,

17:51.374 --> 17:52.854
go with god.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.769
- Take the keys, Beth.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.687
- Next time, I hold the gun.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.697
- Hey, where--where
is the beer?

18:09.740 --> 18:11.264
- In the cooler
in the basement.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.267
- Well, that'll only take
me an hour.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.182
- Where can I sell a car
for parts?

18:17.922 --> 18:21.535
- We're not selling our car.
- It's not our car.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.276
- Whose is it?
- It doesn't matter.

18:23.319 --> 18:24.799
- Well, I'd like to know.
- I don't know.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.279
- What is this, "Fast and the
Furious?" It is, isn't it?

18:26.322 --> 18:27.802
- I don't have a lot of time.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.456
- What does he think he's
Vin Diesel all of a sudden?

18:29.499 --> 18:30.631
I'm not an idiot.
- You're just going to have

18:30.674 --> 18:32.285
to trust me, okay?

18:32.328 --> 18:34.287
- Trust you? I have a bullet
lodged a half inch

18:34.330 --> 18:35.897
from my spine because you
can't stop seeing this guy.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.638
Oh,
but I'm supposed to trust you.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.727
I'm supposed to trust that you
have a great idea what to do

18:39.770 --> 18:41.337
with everyone--
- Let me help you.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.905
- I got it, thank you!
I said I've got it!

19:02.228 --> 19:04.273
You should talk to Dominic
in Service.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.579
He's been around.

19:07.537 --> 19:08.625
- Okay.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.326
- What kind of car is it?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.198
- A Tesla.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.505
- You can't sell
a Tesla for parts.

19:18.548 --> 19:19.636
- Why not?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.899
It's like a giant iPad.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.861
Next time, go for the Honda.

19:51.929 --> 19:55.237
Tequila?
- Top shelf on the left.

20:04.464 --> 20:08.468
- Did you not...
want a boy or...?

20:08.511 --> 20:10.644
- It's a boy?
- Whoops.

20:11.993 --> 20:15.910
- Oh, my God,
this is so messed up.

20:17.868 --> 20:21.350
- Hey, do you want me to go
grab one of your friends, or...

20:21.394 --> 20:22.917
- They're not my friends.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.789
They're just bitches
I follow on Instagram.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.837
- Well I'll--
I'll get Greg then, okay?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.752
- I don't think
he wants a baby.

20:31.795 --> 20:32.883
- What?

20:32.927 --> 20:35.277
- He's been really weird.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.800
Like he's not there.

20:36.844 --> 20:40.500
You know, like, he's like,
there but he's not, like,

20:40.543 --> 20:42.632
there, there, you know?

20:44.895 --> 20:47.463
- What was he like
when you were pregnant?

20:47.507 --> 20:49.596
- I mean--freaked out.

20:49.639 --> 20:52.294
- Yeah.
- For sure.

20:52.338 --> 20:56.298
But you know, we also had
finals and teenage onset acne.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
- So.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.913
- What if there
is something really wrong?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.967
- You know,
I think you should just...

21:13.010 --> 21:14.708
Just talk to him.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.972
- Yeah, because maybe,
you know, it's just nerves.

21:18.015 --> 21:20.017
- Yeah.
It's probably that.

21:21.062 --> 21:22.585
- Okay.

21:23.717 --> 21:27.677
Can you...
Can you stay for just a minute?

21:29.549 --> 21:30.724
- Sure.

21:39.733 --> 21:42.431
You guys buy a lot of quinoa.

21:42.475 --> 21:45.478
- It's a really good
source of protein.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.668
- I gotta ask you something.

22:01.711 --> 22:02.973
- Okay.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.801
- Is Stan good with you, now?

22:06.542 --> 22:08.675
- I mean, in what--
- With the cheating and lying,

22:08.718 --> 22:10.633
all of it.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.766
Are you ever going to look at
him the same way you used to?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.071
- It's different.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.858
- That's not an answer.

22:17.901 --> 22:23.385
- When Dean cheated and lied,
he did it for Dean.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.865
You did it for your family.

22:27.650 --> 22:31.524
And besides, I don't know that
I've ever looked at Dean

22:31.567 --> 22:33.090
the way you look at Stan.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.006
- Damn.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.401
- Yeah.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.894
- Sorry 'bout the wait, ladies.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.200
- Whoa.

22:56.244 --> 22:59.639
- Is there a problem?
- I mean, we'll take it.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.989
- Hell yeah, we'll take it.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.470
- So this isn't your car.
- It is now.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.472
- Wait, what--
what car do you drive?

23:06.515 --> 23:07.908
- A Tesla, baby.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.084
- We're about to hit the club.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.480
- Come on,
I'm really slammed here.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.612
- Fine, the Honda.

23:16.656 --> 23:18.484
- Civic or Accord?
- Accord.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.094
- Black or silver?

23:20.137 --> 23:21.574
- Black.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.495
- It's only half.
- You'll get the other half

23:29.538 --> 23:30.800
when we know
you've left the country.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.541
- Whoa, no.
That was not the deal.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.631
- The deal was we kill you.
Want to go back to that?

23:39.548 --> 23:41.115
- How will I get it?

23:41.158 --> 23:42.246
- We'll mail it.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.770
- You'll need my address.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.685
- Yeah, it's kind of
how mail works.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.121
- I'm not going to compromise
my location.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.557
- We'll Venmo you.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.950
- Oh, and have the IRS
up my ass?

23:49.993 --> 23:53.606
- Fine. PayPal.
- It's the same problem.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.216
- P.O. box.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.176
- Yeah, that works.
- Done.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.569
- Great.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.051
- I'll leave first thing
in the morning.

24:07.620 --> 24:08.664
- Hey.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.624
I meant what I said.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.234
If it's not us it will be them.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.844
- I'll drop you a postcard.

24:31.731 --> 24:35.212
- I got an early shift,
so you're on car pool.

24:36.344 --> 24:38.651
- Couches are for cheaters,
Stanley.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.000
Did you cheat?

24:40.043 --> 24:41.741
- Nope.
- Neither did I.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.177
- What do you want here?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.092
- I want you to
come back to bed.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.659
- Well I can't ask like this
didn't happen.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.051
- So maybe we can just
give it back then.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.792
-  What are you
talking about?

24:49.836 --> 24:51.620
- The kidney.
Maybe we can return it.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.187
- Yeah, okay.
That's just crazy talk now.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.841
- What's crazy is that you
can't even look at me.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.190
- You know what?
You lied to my face.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.800
- I saved her life.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.978
It wasn't God or the church

25:02.022 --> 25:03.719
or any of those
thoughts and prayers.

25:03.763 --> 25:04.938
It was me.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.332
You say you don't know
who I am.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.596
Well let me introduce myself.
I'm the crazy ass bitch

25:10.639 --> 25:12.032
that robbed a grocery store

25:12.075 --> 25:14.295
to save her child
and protect her family.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.863
Your child and your family.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.647
I'm that bitch.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.258
Nice to meet you.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.175
And you're welcome.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.573
- Nana!

25:31.617 --> 25:32.661
Nana, it's me.
Open up.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.448
- Leslie, what time is it?

25:37.884 --> 25:40.016
- Oh, it's late, Nana.
I'm sorry.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.063
- I fell asleep during "Wheel."

25:43.106 --> 25:45.413
Why don't you come back
tomorrow?

25:45.456 --> 25:47.546
- Uh, no, we gotta do this now,
okay?

25:47.589 --> 25:49.809
- What's that?
- Oh. It's a phone, Nana.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.462
- I already have a phone.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.768
- Well, but,
you can't call long distance.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.640
- I don't call anyone
out of town.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.729
- Well you might need to,
and this way you can.

25:56.772 --> 26:00.602
It's unlimited. Oh, and,
uh, here, check this out.

26:00.646 --> 26:04.780
- Huh? See, now we can see
each other any time we want.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.477
- But you're right around
the corner.

26:06.521 --> 26:07.783
- Yeah, but what if I wasn't.
- But you are.

26:07.827 --> 26:08.958
- But what if I wasn't!

26:15.051 --> 26:17.576
- Is everything all right,
Leslie?

26:19.752 --> 26:21.492
- Yeah.

26:21.536 --> 26:24.626
- Are you in any
sort of trouble?

26:24.670 --> 26:25.758
- No.

26:31.024 --> 26:34.505
- Mildred's grandkids
got her one of these.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.857
- I think it was so
they didn't have to visit.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.902
- Oh, yeah?
Did she use it?

26:39.946 --> 26:41.904
- For about a week.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.776
Then she died.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.565
I can't waste my time
learning a whole new gadget.

26:51.697 --> 26:54.656
How about milk
and cookie, huh?

26:54.700 --> 26:56.484
That be good?

26:56.527 --> 26:58.094
- Yeah, sure.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.541
- Hello?

27:10.585 --> 27:12.674
How about a little customer
service here, huh, guys?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.808
- What's going on, Janet?
Ron, Gary?

27:15.851 --> 27:16.983
- Hey, welcome back, man.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.854
What are you doing here, Mr. B?

27:18.898 --> 27:21.988
- Last time I checked we had
some cars to sell, am I right?

27:22.031 --> 27:25.687
Look guys, I just want to say,
um, it's real nice to be back.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.821
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, oh yeah, I'm great.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.043
What is it the kids do?

27:34.087 --> 27:34.957
- Oh!

27:37.873 --> 27:40.920
- Hey, what is that Vette
still doing here.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.052
- Oh, that?
Deal fell through.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.620
Somebody's wife.
- Well.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.101
By the end of the day
that bad boy is mine.

27:48.144 --> 27:51.713
You mark my words.
It is on, gentlemen.

27:51.757 --> 27:55.935
- All right guys, let's--let's
get out there and just have a--

27:55.978 --> 27:58.067
let's have an awesome day, huh?
- Let's do it.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.983
- Right.
- Good to see you, man.

28:01.027 --> 28:02.681
- Okay.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.119
- Hey, mom, watch.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.557
- You're doing great.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.737
- Kid's got a lot going on.
- We like to keep him busy.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.827
- Oh yeah?
That's what he like?

28:18.871 --> 28:20.655
- He's 11.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.135
- Yeah, but if he doesn't
want to do something

28:22.178 --> 28:23.876
he ain't going
to be any good at it.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.617
- You're parenting my kid now?

28:26.661 --> 28:28.707
- Nah.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.099
No, I'm just saying
not everybody

28:30.143 --> 28:32.145
could be good at everything.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.717
- So that's it?

28:42.677 --> 28:43.809
So how'd you do it?

28:45.114 --> 28:46.725
- You want details?

28:46.768 --> 28:48.683
- Oh, please.

28:49.815 --> 28:52.818
- I googled the cleanest way
to kill somebody.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.691
There's a part of the brain
called the light switch

28:56.735 --> 28:58.867
in the back of your head.

28:58.911 --> 29:02.044
I had tarps and coveralls
from painting Emma's nursery.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.220
- Hey, mom, watch me!

29:05.918 --> 29:07.789
- Hey, I'm watching!

29:12.794 --> 29:15.275
We made him turn around
and put him on his knees.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.019
He cried like a baby.

29:23.718 --> 29:26.503
Then we turned out his lights.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.028
- And what did you do
with the body?

29:31.682 --> 29:34.511
- Put it in
a duffel with bricks.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.818
We rented a boat and took it
out as far as we could.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.559
- And you cleaned the boat?

29:39.125 --> 29:40.909
- Of course.

29:40.953 --> 29:44.043
- Wow, so you must have not had
much sleep then, huh?

29:44.086 --> 29:47.176
- Well, I'm a mother of four
so I'm used to it.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.308
- Right.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.051
That's a hell of a story.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.879
- Thank you.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.806
- Yeah,
I just wish it was true.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.853
You see,
you can't shoot someone

30:11.897 --> 30:14.029
if you don't use any bullets.

30:21.254 --> 30:25.084
- Hey mom!
I'm gonna dive.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.827
- Oh, you should watch.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.306
This will be good.

30:39.707 --> 30:43.058
- It's 455 horse power.
0 to 60 in four flat.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.755
- Damn, that's lit.

30:44.799 --> 30:49.630
- Oh, man.
It is lit.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.241
- Hey, you okay?
You look a little hot there.

30:52.285 --> 30:57.333
- Yeah, standing next to this
baby, anybody looks hot.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.640
And look at that,
rolling on twenty-twos.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.729
- Yeah, uh, you got a little--

31:01.772 --> 31:03.774
- Only car in the world that
compares to this one,

31:03.818 --> 31:06.081
in my opinion, is the Ferrari.

31:06.125 --> 31:09.650
And it's what--it's five times
as expe--as expensive,

31:09.693 --> 31:12.392
and it's not made in America,
so...

31:12.435 --> 31:15.786
- Yeah, you know, you've got
some blood right there.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.354
- You know what?
We sh--we should just go in...

31:18.398 --> 31:21.140
- Yeah, I'm gonna--you know,
I'm gonna come back.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.098
- I can't...

31:23.142 --> 31:25.884
I can't--I can't promise that
this is still gonna be here.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.234
- I really think you need
to see a doctor.

31:31.019 --> 31:33.804
Can we get a little help?
We need a little help here!

31:41.943 --> 31:45.164
- Hey,
what's with the pity party?

31:46.817 --> 31:48.689
- Oh, she's picking out
her wedding cake.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.213
- Hold up,
she's getting married?

31:51.257 --> 31:53.955
- Yeah, people say that
Mr. Peterson knocked her up,

31:53.999 --> 31:56.088
but, uh,
I think it's true love.

31:56.131 --> 31:58.220
- Have a Fine and Frugal day.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.356
- Um. I--I can get that.

32:03.399 --> 32:07.012
- Wow. Big news.
Congrats.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.319
- Can I try the lemon next?

32:10.363 --> 32:15.237
- So, how did he propose?
Poem? Song? Rape?

32:15.281 --> 32:19.024
- I don't have a choice, okay?
He's talking to the FBI.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.069
- Look,
he's not talking to anybody.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.332
He is long gone by now.

32:23.376 --> 32:24.943
- What?

32:24.986 --> 32:26.205
- He's probably in Canada
because it's, like,

32:26.248 --> 32:28.816
the only other country
he's ever heard of.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.339
- He's not in Canada.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.689
- Okay, maybe Mexico but--

32:32.733 --> 32:35.736
- He just booked our reception
hall an hour ago.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.783
- And he paid in cash, right?

32:39.827 --> 32:42.003
- He's invited
my entire church.

33:02.676 --> 33:06.767
- I've been calling and calling
about that sign.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.203
- I know.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.905
- No one's ever
going to fix it.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.572
- Hey, Carl?

33:33.489 --> 33:39.365
Remember when you needed
time off for your kid's play?

33:39.408 --> 33:41.671
And I made you work overtime.

33:41.715 --> 33:45.588
And then I didn't pay overtime.
Instead, I docked you.

33:45.632 --> 33:49.853
Because someone left
the meat locker open?

33:51.855 --> 33:54.162
Well...

33:54.206 --> 33:56.556
That someone was me.

33:56.599 --> 34:01.865
But I couldn't tell you because
I knew you would be pissed.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.262
How pissed are you, Carl?

34:14.530 --> 34:16.967
There were like,
three or four of them.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.666
I mean, they just--
they came out of nowhere, man.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.363
- This won't happen again.

34:21.407 --> 34:24.497
If I got to deliver you to
the court house myself I will.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.674
- Appreciate it.
- You have my word.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.979
All right?

34:31.808 --> 34:33.897
- Let's get somebody in here
to clean you up?

34:49.391 --> 34:50.958
- Give me the gun.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.351
- I don't have it.

34:52.394 --> 34:53.395
- What do you mean
you don't have it?

34:53.439 --> 34:54.875
- I gave it back.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.398
- Why would you do that?

34:57.660 --> 34:59.488
- I have children.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.316
I don't want a gun
in the house.

35:02.578 --> 35:06.800
- Then I'll just use Stan's.
- He's a cop, Annie.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.631
- Let's just go to a Walmart
and I will literally

35:11.674 --> 35:13.241
just buy one, like,
over the counter or whatever.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.808
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.550
- You gonna wait the seven days
for the permit?

35:17.593 --> 35:19.639
- Dammit. I'm gonna kill him!

35:19.682 --> 35:25.949
Stupid, whiny, little...face.
Little...

35:25.993 --> 35:27.386
Ah! I'm gonna kill him,

35:27.429 --> 35:28.996
I'm gonna kill him
in his entire face.

35:34.610 --> 35:35.829
You okay?

what's happening.

the anchor up.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.070
- Copy. Hauling anchor.

36:47.553 --> 36:50.599
- Actually, Conrad,
just take over the anchor,

36:50.643 --> 36:52.514
and Joao you can come
into the bridge.

36:52.558 --> 36:53.602
- Copy that.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.387
- Something I need to know.

36:58.390 --> 36:59.608
- Okay.

37:02.437 --> 37:05.005
Is Captain Sandy still
giving Conrad a hard time?

37:07.050 --> 37:08.704
- She's jamming him up good.

37:08.748 --> 37:12.099
- Now see, that woman needs
to calm her ass down.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.797
- She let Joao
dock the yacht.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.539
- What? That's Conrad's job.
- I know. I know.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.062
- That's just plain mean.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.503
You turn it up a little bit,
please?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.725
- You need your hearing
checked.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.074
- What's that now?

37:59.973 --> 38:02.192
- You know, I bet it was one
of those Pharma sluts

38:02.236 --> 38:03.368
that he works with.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.891
Their short skirts.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.893
You know, they're always
trying to land doctors.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.677
- Greg's not a doctor.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.723
- Yeah, he sells boner pills.

38:10.766 --> 38:13.987
Something bad
was bound to happen.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.989
- It's really not your fault.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.861
- I just feel so stupid.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.737
- Do you want
the honest to god truth?

38:26.869 --> 38:29.959
The second you see
that little kid's face

38:30.786 --> 38:32.440
nothing else matters.

38:34.616 --> 38:37.227
- I heard you split so wide

38:37.271 --> 38:39.708
you could park
a food truck in there?

38:39.752 --> 38:42.581
- Oh, it looks like a sleeping
bag with the zipper torn off.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.454
- 100%.
- Ugh.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.630
- And do not get me started
on your nipples, my friend.

38:51.285 --> 38:53.505
- Mine look like
sausages already.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.158
Is that normal?

38:55.202 --> 38:57.770
- Now just picture that you put
them in a food dehydrator for,

38:57.813 --> 39:01.774
like, seven weeks and then you
feed them to your dog and--

39:01.817 --> 39:05.081
- They were out of cinnamon,
so...
