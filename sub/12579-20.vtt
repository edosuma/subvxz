00:03.167 --> 00:05.499
- Hank, can I use your bathroom?
- No.

00:05.603 --> 00:07.764
But I locked myself out of my house.

00:07.871 --> 00:08.895
No.

00:09.607 --> 00:11.234
Can I use your phone to call a locksmith?

00:11.342 --> 00:15.210
If I let you use the phone,
you'll sneak in and use the toilet.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.843
Look, I'd prefer it if no one ever had to use
the bathroom.

00:19.950 --> 00:22.714
But until that day,
let's just make the best of it...

00:22.820 --> 00:25.015
and respect one another's privacy.

00:25.122 --> 00:27.454
From the lukewarm headwaters...

00:27.625 --> 00:29.786
of the mighty Brazos River...

00:29.893 --> 00:31.121
Stop it!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.059
Well, it is his cooler.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.932 --> 01:10.900
Okay, I'm putting you in charge...

01:11.001 --> 01:13.299
of buying our prom tickets
at lunch tomorrow.

01:13.404 --> 01:16.771
I have to break it to Kim and Dooley
they're out of the limo.

01:16.874 --> 01:18.102
Are you listening, Bobby?

01:18.208 --> 01:20.199
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:20.577 --> 01:22.772
We can't cut through the high-school
parking lot.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.440
We're middle-schoolers. They hate us.

01:25.582 --> 01:28.142
High-school students are far too busy
with their studies...

01:28.252 --> 01:31.312
to care about us riding
through their parking lot.

01:31.422 --> 01:33.049
Connie, come back!

01:33.323 --> 01:36.019
Oh! You are forcing me to protect you.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.565
Hey, Shorty.
Where do you think you're going?

01:48.772 --> 01:50.672
We don't want any trouble, gentlemen.

01:50.774 --> 01:53.607
We're not letting you pass
until you give us a little song.

01:53.711 --> 01:54.769
This is crazy.

01:54.878 --> 01:56.277
Just because we go to middle school...

01:56.380 --> 02:00.248
[Singing] If you want to be my lover,
you gotta get with my friends

02:00.350 --> 02:01.339
Connie, go!

02:01.452 --> 02:02.783
- What?
- Hey!

02:03.554 --> 02:04.782
Get him.

02:26.076 --> 02:28.544
I'm gonna beat the crap out of you.

02:33.951 --> 02:36.419
If you're not gonna help, be quiet.

02:41.992 --> 02:43.289
Oh, man!

02:43.393 --> 02:45.020
BOY: Dude, there he is.

02:52.136 --> 02:54.127
- Yup.
- Yup.

02:56.874 --> 02:58.341
What the heck?

03:01.612 --> 03:03.978
You know, Hank, your selfish refusal...

03:04.081 --> 03:07.642
to let Bill use your bathroom
got me thinking.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.287
I plan on creating and then cornering...

03:11.522 --> 03:13.854
the premium port-a-potty market.

03:14.024 --> 03:16.959
It'll be the best dollar
a person could spend.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.654
Nobody's gonna want to pay good money
to use...

03:19.763 --> 03:22.231
a stinky portable... washroom.

03:22.633 --> 03:23.600
Stinky?

03:23.700 --> 03:26.533
DALE: With the finest lotions,
the softest tissues...

03:26.637 --> 03:28.764
and the most pleasing lighting design...

03:28.872 --> 03:33.070
the Port-a-Gribble will be a
4-by-5-by-8-foot slice of paradise.

03:33.443 --> 03:35.707
Finally a vacation I can afford.

03:35.813 --> 03:38.043
Not so fast.

03:38.415 --> 03:41.475
A dollar buys the key.
That's the friend price.

03:44.588 --> 03:45.885
Thank you.

03:51.628 --> 03:55.587
BILL: Oh! I feel like I'm a millionaire
construction worker.

03:59.336 --> 04:00.325
What the...

04:00.437 --> 04:03.372
Oh, man, look at him running around
with that flabby little...

04:03.473 --> 04:05.304
BILL: What? What did I miss?

04:05.742 --> 04:08.074
Hank, we are getting his bike right now.

04:08.178 --> 04:10.942
If we move fast,
maybe we can still find his pants.

04:11.048 --> 04:15.314
Peggy, if we get his bike now,
we'll be getting it for him until he's 16.

04:15.419 --> 04:17.148
Then we'll be getting his truck.

04:17.254 --> 04:21.418
It's kind of a tradition for high-schoolers
to pick on the young and the weak.

04:21.524 --> 04:22.685
No offense, Son.

04:22.793 --> 04:24.954
All right. I'll go get the bike.

04:25.229 --> 04:30.166
Just make sure you videotape
my chef programs while I'm in the coma.

04:34.905 --> 04:36.133
Don't be a hero.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.038
Curl up in a ball and cry if you have to.

04:41.578 --> 04:43.808
Listen, if anything happens...

04:44.014 --> 04:46.107
promise me you'll take care of Connie.

04:46.216 --> 04:48.480
Make sure she goes to the prom.

04:48.685 --> 04:50.880
It's really important to her.

04:51.188 --> 04:53.179
Me and Connie at the prom?

04:54.725 --> 04:55.692
Wow!

04:56.026 --> 04:57.823
I won't let you down.

05:00.197 --> 05:03.860
Bobby? Tom Landry Middle School rules.

05:04.101 --> 05:06.001
TLMSR.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.073
Where's my bike?

05:13.176 --> 05:16.509
Yeah. So before I knew it,
my entire bangs were on fire.

05:16.613 --> 05:19.707
Okay. But did he say whether or not
he likes me?

05:20.350 --> 05:21.578
[School bell ringing]

05:22.319 --> 05:23.343
Yeah.

05:23.921 --> 05:25.616
Okay, let's go, freshman.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.246
That was the warning bell.

05:27.357 --> 05:28.688
Freshman? No.

05:28.792 --> 05:31.260
No, sir. I'm still in middle school.

05:31.361 --> 05:33.989
Look, I know it's tough in there
for a freshman.

05:34.097 --> 05:35.223
They're animals.

05:35.332 --> 05:36.663
I got some advice for you.

05:36.767 --> 05:39.258
Puff out your chest and walk like this.

05:39.369 --> 05:42.065
I saw a gorilla do it on a nature show.

05:42.406 --> 05:44.237
Scared the crap out of me.

05:44.341 --> 05:45.672
Now, go on.

06:06.129 --> 06:09.565
...and the uterine wall sloughs off...

06:20.877 --> 06:23.368
Taco Bueno in school?

06:23.547 --> 06:26.243
I thought that was just an urban legend.

06:35.325 --> 06:38.294
"Godspell"? That was banned
in middle school.

06:38.628 --> 06:40.357
I have arrived.

06:40.931 --> 06:43.195
I am so wassup.

06:47.571 --> 06:50.267
Bobby! Thank God you're alive.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.034
I've never been more alive in my life.

06:53.443 --> 06:55.172
I was in high school.

06:55.278 --> 06:57.906
It was like I was living in a dream.

06:58.248 --> 06:59.715
But if it was all a dream...

06:59.816 --> 07:03.274
how did I get this burrito wrapper
from Taco Bueno?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.846
BOBBY: That's right.

07:04.955 --> 07:08.584
Taco Bueno, in the food court,
at the high school.

07:08.892 --> 07:10.359
Did they have a language lab?

07:10.460 --> 07:12.951
Did you notice what the
teacher-student ratio was?

07:13.296 --> 07:15.992
Oh! My mind is just racing with questions.

07:16.099 --> 07:17.498
I gotta get back.

07:17.601 --> 07:20.798
The Colonel's cooking up something tasty
for lunch...

07:20.904 --> 07:23.464
in the food court, at the high school.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.027
Hey, fresh meat,
this is the senior bathroom.

07:46.129 --> 07:48.393
I'm gonna shove your head in the toilet.

07:48.498 --> 07:50.557
Put me down. My growth is stunted.

07:50.667 --> 07:53.568
My kidneys are broken. I'm really a senior.

07:54.337 --> 07:56.168
Like that kid on that old TV show?

07:56.273 --> 07:59.970
Yes, exactly like that kid
on that old TV show.

08:00.277 --> 08:01.869
Now, put me down.

08:02.946 --> 08:04.937
You know, you do look kind of familiar.

08:05.082 --> 08:07.209
Didn't we see you at Conklin's party?

08:07.317 --> 08:11.219
Anybody who says they remember
that party wasn't really there.

08:11.521 --> 08:13.216
- Oh, Dude.
- Dude.

08:17.294 --> 08:20.786
Okay. So, what's the deal with all the
"No Doubt" posters?

08:21.231 --> 08:23.563
Hey, wait. I thought you said
you went to school here.

08:23.667 --> 08:24.759
I do.

08:25.702 --> 08:28.865
But I've been in dialysis
the last couple of months.

08:28.972 --> 08:32.100
Lefty shut down and I just got him
working again.

08:32.708 --> 08:34.142
Sucks for you.

08:34.244 --> 08:37.145
Well, anyway, we're in the middle of
a big radio contest with...

08:37.246 --> 08:39.306
with, like, every high school in Texas.

08:40.484 --> 08:42.679
If we win,
No Doubt's gonna play our prom.

08:42.785 --> 08:45.687
We're in fifth place
behind a Catholic girls' school.

08:45.789 --> 08:47.222
Those chicks are tough.

08:47.324 --> 08:48.814
No Doubt rules.

08:49.459 --> 08:52.189
All we've got is some Vegas theme
at our dance...

08:53.263 --> 08:54.821
at the hospital.

08:55.198 --> 08:56.426
So, what do you do?

08:56.533 --> 08:58.023
Eat weird stuff?

08:58.135 --> 09:00.933
Eat stuff, stack stuff, spray paint stuff.

09:01.037 --> 09:02.868
We listen to Pig 106 every morning.

09:02.973 --> 09:05.441
Wacky and Steve tell us what to do.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.770
[School bell ringing]

09:06.877 --> 09:09.471
Yeah! It's pep-rally time.

09:09.813 --> 09:11.508
Come on, kidney boy.

09:12.249 --> 09:13.341
Cool.

09:15.719 --> 09:19.018
Wow! Your cheerleaders
really have boobies.

09:19.189 --> 09:21.657
Yeah. Even junior varsity has them.

09:22.926 --> 09:25.554
Okay, settle people. Settle.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.659
You're gonna want to hear this one.

09:27.764 --> 09:28.753
Conklin!

09:28.865 --> 09:31.333
Okay, I just got the word
from Wacky and Steve...

09:31.434 --> 09:34.232
that Pierce High School lost their
liability insurance...

09:34.337 --> 09:37.898
and can't do the Dishwasher of Doom.

09:38.041 --> 09:39.338
So, they're out.

09:39.576 --> 09:43.808
So that puts us in the top four
with 296 points.

09:44.014 --> 09:46.881
There's no doubt we're gonna win
this thing.

09:48.185 --> 09:50.278
God, I love this school.

09:50.754 --> 09:51.743
Yeah!

09:52.389 --> 09:54.482
Friends, I know you've used toilets.

09:54.591 --> 09:58.152
But I'll wager you've never
truly experienced one.

09:58.495 --> 10:02.226
Why just relieve yourself
when you can reward yourself?

10:03.700 --> 10:05.531
Mr. Strickland, is it?

10:05.869 --> 10:09.066
Well, I might be able to conjure up
a little something.

10:09.172 --> 10:11.140
STRICKLAND: Hank, pay the toilet man.

10:15.679 --> 10:16.703
All right.

10:18.582 --> 10:21.915
All right, Anthony. The record's a minute.
You ready?

10:28.758 --> 10:29.952
Dude...

10:30.727 --> 10:32.490
ANTHONY: Let me out. I can't breathe.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.089
I taste soap.

10:38.702 --> 10:40.033
Do we have anybody short?

10:40.136 --> 10:42.161
Where's that petite kid who tumbles?

10:42.272 --> 10:44.934
Rosemary? She moved to Oklahoma.

10:45.508 --> 10:46.873
I'll do it.

10:47.911 --> 10:49.503
What about your kidneys?

10:49.613 --> 10:52.013
They're full of Arlen High spirit.

10:54.251 --> 10:55.513
Who is he?

10:55.619 --> 10:58.144
He's so cute... and helpless.

10:58.255 --> 11:01.247
Kidney boy. We call him that because
of his bad kidneys.

11:01.358 --> 11:03.622
You mean, like, he could die any minute?

11:03.727 --> 11:05.217
Try any second.

11:09.199 --> 11:11.497
BOBBY: Oh, yeah! Arlen High rules.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.440
I can't stop thinking about Connie.

11:19.376 --> 11:22.174
I know she's Bobby's girl. But I love her.

11:22.479 --> 11:24.743
They're not married. Go for it.

11:24.981 --> 11:28.178
BOBBY: I need the latest hard numbers
in the No Doubt competition.

11:28.285 --> 11:30.412
An estimate does me no good.

11:31.988 --> 11:35.424
Pig 106 says Lubbock is getting
a point a person...

11:35.525 --> 11:37.686
for cramming kids into a phone booth.

11:37.794 --> 11:39.261
A phone booth?

11:40.063 --> 11:42.623
- How are we ever gonna beat that?
- Wait.

11:42.732 --> 11:46.031
I've got something that is the size
of a phone booth.

11:46.169 --> 11:47.727
And smells like a phone booth.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.065
A port-a-potty.

11:49.172 --> 11:50.264
- That's rad.
- Yeah.

11:50.373 --> 11:51.840
No Doubt is ours.

11:51.941 --> 11:53.067
CONNIE: Bobby?

11:56.880 --> 11:59.178
Please tell me you bought
our prom tickets.

12:00.650 --> 12:02.709
I've got a situation here, Connie.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.218
Lubbock is cramming kids
into a phone booth.

12:05.322 --> 12:06.983
I'll get the tickets tomorrow.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.887
Bobby, they're sold out.

12:08.992 --> 12:12.484
It turns out all those nerds who said
they have girlfriends at other schools...

12:12.595 --> 12:13.823
weren't lying.

12:14.464 --> 12:18.491
Well, then come with me
to the high-school prom.

12:18.601 --> 12:20.193
They're getting No Doubt to play.

12:20.303 --> 12:22.066
The high-school prom?

12:22.472 --> 12:24.667
Me at the high-school prom...

12:25.241 --> 12:27.937
hanging out with Arlen's best teachers.

12:29.479 --> 12:32.505
- Who's the middle-school cheese?
- Oh, no.

12:32.982 --> 12:36.611
She's a high-school girl I know
from the children's hospital.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.187
Yeah, she has...

12:38.822 --> 12:39.982
a little tail.

12:40.090 --> 12:42.081
It's not like a monkey...

12:42.258 --> 12:44.419
more like a hamster.

12:44.627 --> 12:46.322
They can't operate.

12:46.496 --> 12:49.294
So, they're dissolving it
with Compound W.

12:49.699 --> 12:51.929
Oh, that brave little hamster girl.

12:52.035 --> 12:54.799
And you are so sweet to take care of her.

12:59.309 --> 13:02.073
I like the bow tie. Lose everything else.

13:04.447 --> 13:06.039
Check you out.

13:07.016 --> 13:08.745
That is one fly tux.

13:09.085 --> 13:10.848
Is that hamster girl?

13:11.755 --> 13:13.518
She's very sensitive.

13:13.623 --> 13:15.614
And she has super hearing.

13:15.859 --> 13:20.558
Oh. Because I was gonna tell you that
Vivian wants to go to the prom with you.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.132
What are you staring at?

13:25.235 --> 13:26.827
Nothing. I was...

13:26.936 --> 13:28.961
Can you pick up things with your tail?

13:29.072 --> 13:30.733
Like that shoe?

13:30.907 --> 13:33.068
Yeah. Does it wag when you're happy?

13:33.176 --> 13:36.942
Connie, why don't we try this tux on
in the dressing room?

13:39.249 --> 13:42.218
Bobby, why do those guys think
I have a tail?

13:42.485 --> 13:46.319
Oh, probably because medical science...

13:46.856 --> 13:49.723
Oh! I told them you had one.

13:49.826 --> 13:51.225
Why were you making fun of me?

13:51.327 --> 13:54.228
No. It's very romantic.

13:54.664 --> 13:58.122
You have a tail. I have bad kidneys.

13:58.501 --> 14:01.436
We met on a rainy day at hospital camp.

14:02.071 --> 14:05.063
And now we can go
to the high-school prom.

14:05.408 --> 14:07.603
I thought they liked you
because you were so cool...

14:07.710 --> 14:09.610
not pitied you because you're a freak.

14:09.712 --> 14:12.772
No! I have the medical condition.
You're the freak.

14:12.882 --> 14:15.476
You've gotta keep this straight
or we're never gonna pull it off.

14:15.585 --> 14:18.076
I am not gonna pretend
I have a medical problem.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.679
There are people who really have tails.

14:20.790 --> 14:23.657
Maybe. Well, I'm not going.

14:25.128 --> 14:28.291
Fine! But I'm going
to the high-school prom.

14:28.731 --> 14:29.959
What's with hamster girl?

14:30.066 --> 14:32.534
Oh, she can't go to the prom.

14:33.102 --> 14:36.697
She's having that problem with her DNA
or something.

14:36.806 --> 14:39.104
I don't know. It's bad.

14:39.275 --> 14:41.470
Hey, that means you can take Vivian.

14:42.645 --> 14:44.044
- Dude!
- Dude!

15:00.063 --> 15:02.930
Let's go, kidney boy. Come on. Suck it in.

15:07.837 --> 15:08.861
I...

15:10.874 --> 15:13.069
thought maybe if you're not still
creeped out by me...

15:13.176 --> 15:14.666
you might go to the prom with me.

15:14.777 --> 15:16.176
I've got two tickets.

15:16.279 --> 15:19.146
If you're not still, you know, creeped out.

15:21.684 --> 15:23.174
I'd be honored.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.931
Everybody settle down.

15:39.602 --> 15:43.732
Any minute now I'm expecting
a phone call from Pig106.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.565
We're gonna find out...

15:49.679 --> 15:51.738
PRINCIPAL: Hello?
WACKY: Yes. Hello.

15:51.848 --> 15:53.907
I'd like to order a pizza.

15:54.284 --> 15:56.946
Please, ma 'am.
We're trying to keep the line clear.

15:57.053 --> 16:00.216
STEVE: Hey, you've been pranked
by Wacky and Steve.

16:02.825 --> 16:05.259
WACKY: Hey, we have a lady here
who'd like to speak to you.

16:05.395 --> 16:06.419
She's really hot.

16:06.529 --> 16:09.362
And I know I've spent more than
a few nights thinking about her.

16:09.465 --> 16:10.489
Here she is.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.965
Steve's mom!

16:12.635 --> 16:14.262
STEVE: Dang, now I've been pranked.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.462
Let's just get to the get to.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.540
There's someone that wants to talk
to you.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.938
GWEN: Hey, what's up?
This is Gwen from No Doubt.

16:20.043 --> 16:21.032
TOM: Hey, this is Tom from No Doubt.

16:21.144 --> 16:23.009
ADRIAN: Hey, how're you doing?
This is Tony from No Doubt.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.545
TONY: That's not Tony, that was Adrian.

16:24.647 --> 16:25.978
I'm Tony from No Doubt.

16:26.082 --> 16:29.210
GWEN: Sorry we can't talk.
But we gotta call Lubbock...

16:29.719 --> 16:32.483
and tell them they lost to Arlen High.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.148
Congratulations, you guys.
See you at the prom.

16:40.964 --> 16:42.989
You still in there, Peggy?

16:43.633 --> 16:45.328
What are you doing?

16:50.006 --> 16:51.837
LUANNE: Uncle Hank, is that you?

16:51.941 --> 16:54.239
I really need someone to talk to.

16:54.344 --> 16:55.709
Uncle Hank.

16:56.312 --> 16:58.041
Okay, Dale. You win.

16:58.348 --> 17:00.646
I need to use your port-a-room.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.878
So, now Mr.
I'll-Only-Share-A-Toilet-With-My-Wife...

17:04.988 --> 17:06.546
wants to share one with us.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.749
Well, take a walk, toilet snob.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.157
Hold on, Bill.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.728
Here at Port-a-Gribble,
we reserve the right...

17:13.829 --> 17:16.355
to refuse service to no one.

17:16.633 --> 17:18.362
No shirt, no shoes...

17:18.468 --> 17:19.833
yes service.

17:36.019 --> 17:37.213
Flowers.

17:48.231 --> 17:49.823

[Ride With Me by Nelly playing]

17:55.104 --> 17:58.267
All right, what are we water-ballooning?

17:58.841 --> 18:00.832
- Cows?
- Even better.

18:01.344 --> 18:03.710
Tonight's the middle-school prom.

18:04.914 --> 18:09.112
BOBBY: As high-schoolers, we should
be doing something way cooler than this.

18:09.919 --> 18:13.218
Bowling's on me. We can steal shoes.

18:20.363 --> 18:21.625
KIM: Oh, thanks.

18:21.731 --> 18:22.891
Run, Dooley.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.294
- No!
- You got soaked.

18:31.808 --> 18:35.505
Well, you're just jealous because
it's Friday night and we have dates.

18:35.611 --> 18:38.409
Hey, hamster girl,
what are you doing here?

18:39.949 --> 18:42.440
- She's...
- In middle school.

18:42.852 --> 18:44.319
Middle school?

18:46.956 --> 18:50.187
Yeah. The Compound W dissolved
the rest of my tail.

18:50.660 --> 18:53.390
They thought middle school would be
less stressful after...

18:53.529 --> 18:55.895
you know, losing my tail and all.

18:56.666 --> 18:58.657
Okay. So, you're, like all normal now?

18:58.835 --> 19:00.268
Yes. I'm cured.

19:00.369 --> 19:03.429
Good. Because otherwise I'd feel bad
about this.

19:06.943 --> 19:08.638
Get out of the way.

19:09.445 --> 19:13.245
If you want to hit a middle-schooler,
you might as well hit me.

19:13.349 --> 19:14.338
What?

19:14.450 --> 19:16.350
This is my real school.

19:16.452 --> 19:18.750
I am a middle-schooler.

19:18.855 --> 19:21.016
He's so lame. Let's soak him.

19:24.093 --> 19:25.685
ANTHONY: Yeah, soak in it.

19:26.129 --> 19:28.495
Soak in your lies, kidney boy.

19:35.805 --> 19:38.171
Come on, Connie. Let's go inside.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.370
- Hold on, Joseph.
- Oh, that's it.

19:41.544 --> 19:44.069
I can't take these mind games anymore.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.114
You're gonna have to choose right now.

19:46.215 --> 19:47.807
Is it him or me?

19:47.950 --> 19:48.917
What?

19:49.085 --> 19:51.986
Bobby is my boyfriend. You know that.

19:52.655 --> 19:54.646
I'm still your boyfriend?

19:54.957 --> 19:55.946
Really?

19:56.092 --> 19:59.994
Yes, but because you were such a jerk,
I don't have prom tickets.

20:00.096 --> 20:01.495
So, I'm going with Joseph.

20:01.597 --> 20:02.689
Cool.

20:10.873 --> 20:14.070
Joseph understands that you only went
to the prom with him...

20:14.177 --> 20:16.111
to get back at me, right?

20:16.479 --> 20:18.572
I don't really think he does.

20:18.681 --> 20:20.546
It's actually a bit of a mess.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.242
ANTHONY: Hey, kidney boy.

20:26.689 --> 20:28.748
- A prom ticket?
- Yeah.

20:29.292 --> 20:31.487
We got to thinking that
you did help us win.

20:31.594 --> 20:33.494
And No Doubt heard about the kidney boy.

20:33.629 --> 20:36.120
So, you had better be there.
And you had better look sick.

20:36.232 --> 20:39.861
Oh, I'll be there. On one condition.

20:41.070 --> 20:43.470
[Don't Speak by No Doubt playing]

21:11.300 --> 21:13.097
Hey, aren't you kidney boy?

21:13.202 --> 21:14.692
No, sir. I'm not.

21:15.037 --> 21:17.335
Kidney boy is gone for good.

21:19.508 --> 21:21.806
Kidney boy died. He's gone.

21:21.911 --> 21:23.776
What's up, Arlen High?

21:26.916 --> 21:28.679
I just got some terrible news.

21:28.918 --> 21:32.979
This next song is dedicated to the memory
of kidney boy.
