00:01.000 --> 00:02.559
<i>Previously on Kyle XY:</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:04.967
Kyle, you've been with us
for over a week.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.199
You haven't slept?
Not even once?

00:07.307 --> 00:10.037
I'll tell you why Kyle hasn't slept.
He's an alien.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.238
You said the last thing you remember
is being in the woods.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.781
- Now, how did you get there?
- I don't know.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.215
No one noticed he's gone?
How could that be?

00:18.318 --> 00:20.149
He has to have come from somewhere.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.778
Someone has to be missing him.

00:21.888 --> 00:24.948
Trager, I haven't seen you around.
No time for me anymore?

00:25.025 --> 00:27.152
I might be able
to fit you in my schedule.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.595
I want you to draw anything you
remember about where you came from.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.929
This must be the place near Victor Falls
where he was first seen.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.901
Something may have happened there.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.302
I bet your family's
searching for you now.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.671
I mean, they have to be.
You didn't just fall from the sky.

00:42.742 --> 00:45.438
Kyle. Kyle!
It's OK.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.674
- What are you doing here?
- Why did you come?

00:51.584 --> 00:54.018
I came so my family could find me.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.701
Mom, Dad, help!

01:09.769 --> 01:11.669
Kyle, come on, already.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.773
Kyle, get out!

01:15.875 --> 01:17.934
- What?
- I have to take a shower.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.479
And brainiac is still
asleep in the tub.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.242
Kyle, time to get up.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.715
It's so gross that he sleeps in there.

01:25.785 --> 01:28.049
It must remind him of his pod.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.648
What are you gonna do,
lure him with a credit card?

01:32.725 --> 01:35.592
No. That's how I would lure you out.
Kyle's a lot easier.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.132
- Whoa. Teach me.
- Not a chance.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.828
- Me first.
- I'm bursting here.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.463
Use my bathroom. Take a shower
and use soap and shampoo.

01:46.573 --> 01:49.269
- Don't just get your hair wet.
- Fine.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.772
Kyle, come on.
I have to go to work.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.214
He couldn't sleep,
now he's Rip Van Winkle.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.308
- Kyle!
- Dad, this isn't right.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.649
I have to take a shower
before I go to work.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.155
OK, but Kyle first.

02:07.026 --> 02:08.186
Next.

02:15.435 --> 02:18.165
<i>Everyone had something to do
and someplace to be.</i>

02:18.238 --> 02:20.001
Would you mind dropping off Josh?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.836
No, but we gotta get going.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.137
Not until I find my notebook.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.677
Here, dork.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.873
Must've left it there last night
when I went for that pudding.

02:28.948 --> 02:33.317
OK, Kyle. You've got plenty
of paper, markers, Sour Patch Kids.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.086
I cannot believe you're taking Kyle
to your office.

02:39.192 --> 02:42.127
Your mom's got a lot of cases
to catch up on. No big deal.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.527
Besides, it's
Take Your Alien to Work Day.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.656
Thank you.
Call if you need anything.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.394
All right.
We'll be fine.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.594
- Ready, men?
- Ready.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.500
Oh, joy. Summer school.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.901
See you later.

02:55.975 --> 02:58.637
Lori, you're on my way.
I can drop you at work.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.372
That's OK.
I'm meeting Hilary.

03:05.151 --> 03:08.052
<i>- Hello.
- Mrs. Trager, Detective Breen.</i>

03:08.121 --> 03:10.555
- Good morning.
- I need to come see you today.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.887
<i>- Did you find something out?
- Looks like it.</i>

03:12.959 --> 03:15.519
I think Kyle may be connected
to a murder.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.662
<i>I'll give you details
when I see you.</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:53.893
<i>The elevator was a little room that
gave me the strange sensation of rising.</i>

03:55.268 --> 03:57.828
<i>Everyone was careful
not to look at each other,</i>

03:57.904 --> 03:59.872
<i>or touch.</i>

03:59.973 --> 04:02.840
Hello.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.570
Yeah, we're in the elevator.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.475
Tell Brad we got stuck in traffic.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.906
- Yeah.
- We didn't get stuck.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.410
- Just a little white lie.
- You lied?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.321
Yes, but you shouldn't.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.853
Always tell the truth, Kyle, OK?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.599
Here we are, first day on the job.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.501
- I have a job?
- I'm just kidding.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.733
- I want to help.
- I'll find you something.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.502
I'm late for a meeting with Brad.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.066
LWK Software, please hold.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.840
Yes, sir, they're sending somebody.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.515
Yes, I did call. It's just I...

04:43.616 --> 04:45.550
- Sir...
- Rough morning?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.586
Yeah. Our server's down.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.247
- Again?
- It crashed this morning.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.586
But can I help you?

04:52.659 --> 04:54.422
I'm Stephen Trager, the VP.

04:54.494 --> 04:58.362
- Oh, sorry. I'm Alison. I'm a temp.
- A temp?

04:58.431 --> 05:00.956
She's not here all the time.
She's not permanent.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.501
I have to go and talk to Brad.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.229
- Brad?
- The CEO.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.068
- Oh.
- I need you to watch Kyle here.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.733
He's not used to being around
so many people.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.778
Don't worry.
He's just gonna sit here and draw.

05:12.845 --> 05:16.212
Kyle, stay here with Alison.
I'll be right back as soon as I can.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.954
Why don't you wait for your dad
just over there?

05:23.022 --> 05:26.150
Stephen's not my dad.
I'm a temp too.

05:31.030 --> 05:34.193
The victim was shot.
Some hikers found it near Victor Falls.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.202
Detective, I know Kyle was first seen
there, but that was a few weeks ago.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.762
This person was killed way before.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.307
Not necessarily.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.670
The bones are bleached clean.

05:44.744 --> 05:47.372
We know that quicklime
was poured on the body.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.109
- Quicklime?
- Used to decompose a corpse quickly.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.242
Makes it hard to identify.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.219
Probably the same reason
why the teeth are smashed in.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.155
- Kyle could never do this.
- I'm not saying he did.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.452
He's not a suspect?

05:59.525 --> 06:02.085
We can't completely discount
the possibility.

06:02.161 --> 06:06.530
Some flesh remained beneath the victim's
fingernails, indicating a struggle.

06:06.599 --> 06:10.035
Kyle didn't have a scratch on him
when he was found.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.196
For Kyle to be involved in any way...

06:12.271 --> 06:15.434
You yourself said that trauma
may have caused his amnesia.

06:15.541 --> 06:19.978
It's possible he witnessed the attack,
or stumbled upon the skeleton.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.413
- Has he remembered anything?
- I'm still working with him.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.609
All right. Well,

06:26.686 --> 06:29.314
- once he sees these photographs...
- No.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.118
Detective, we can't do that.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.682
Exposing Kyle to something like this
could further traumatize him.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.729
This is a murder investigation.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.663
If Kyle is a witness
or in some way involved,

06:39.732 --> 06:41.290
I need to find out.

06:42.602 --> 06:46.265
If you could find a less disturbing
trigger to help him remember.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.610
This symbol was on some sort
of security key card

06:53.679 --> 06:56.307
we found near the remains in the woods.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.748
The victim or the killer
may have dropped it.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.379
We've run it through our database
but haven't been able to trace it.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.547
If Kyle were to identify it,

07:04.624 --> 07:06.649
he might give us a lead.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.103
This so beats sneaking out at night.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.545
Except it cost you your job.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.878
Who knew missing one shift
was a big deal?

07:30.950 --> 07:34.886
- Your parents must be proud.
- They still think I'm going to work.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.581
Trager, you're a bad girl.

07:42.328 --> 07:44.421
Declan, it's not happening.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.667
There's always tomorrow.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.772
I can't tomorrow.

07:56.275 --> 07:58.106
I gotta golf with my dad.

07:58.177 --> 08:01.635
- Your dad?
- Yeah. We're doing guy stuff all day.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.182
Since when do you like hanging out
with your dad?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.774
Who said I liked it?

08:08.120 --> 08:09.678
I like this, though.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.852
LWK Software.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.692
No, no.
I've called three times already.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.928
We need to get somebody up here.
We need our server fixed now.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.031
LWK Software, please hold.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.943
<i>Everyone had a place to be
and something to do.</i>

08:39.018 --> 08:40.383
<i>Just like at home.</i>

08:45.958 --> 08:48.722
<i>- Excuse me.
- I felt in the way here too.</i>

08:50.396 --> 08:52.762
You must be Kyle.
I'm Mark, a friend of Stephen's.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.231
- He's told me all about you.
- He has?

08:55.334 --> 08:56.460
Absolutely.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.970
So, what do you make of this joint?

09:01.073 --> 09:02.563
The office.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.075
Everyone has a job.

09:04.143 --> 09:05.701
This is true.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.676
Anyways, Stephen's the best.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.181
The way he works, one big family.

09:12.118 --> 09:14.484
I gotta take this, Kyle.
Hang on.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.469
<i>It was as if
it were calling out to me.</i>

09:34.040 --> 09:36.133
<i>The server was something I understood.</i>

09:36.776 --> 09:39.006
<i>A chance for me to be useful.</i>

10:04.670 --> 10:06.900
I told you it's not just me
you're getting.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.531
You're getting my whole team.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.405
- We're a package.
- That package got too expensive.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.775
We had a terrible quarter.
Terrible year.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.542
If we outsource the research,
dump the division...

10:16.616 --> 10:18.243
Dump the division?

10:18.317 --> 10:20.581
These are people
with lives and families.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.587
Mark Renshaw's wife just had a baby.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.421
You're not working in your garage.
You have an obligation to shareholders.

10:26.492 --> 10:29.325
- And my friends.
- They're employees first.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.056
You knew this day was coming.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.894
We have cuts to make.
You know that we do.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.169
All right.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.272
- I'll tell them.
- No, you can't.

10:41.340 --> 10:45.276
You have to... Just wait
till next month, OK? After this quarter.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.836
- They have to make plans.
- Our shareholders will smell trouble.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.779
Our stock could tank.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.614
You have a loyalty to this company.

10:54.453 --> 10:55.818
You can't say a word.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.969
Stephen, um, I, uh...
kind of lost track of Kyle.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.699
What? I told you to watch him.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.003
I'm just supposed to answer the phones.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.201
Oh, no.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.412
Kyle, what did you do?

11:34.260 --> 11:35.420
We need IT up here now.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.361
I've been calling.
There's some kind of design flaw.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.194
They need to call a specialist in.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.407
What the hell is going on here?

11:55.481 --> 11:57.005
Brad, where are you going?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.775
My e-mail's not working.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.086
Wait.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.694
It's about time.

12:13.499 --> 12:15.592
We just left him a few minutes ago.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.266
Good job.

12:29.648 --> 12:30.876
Kyle.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.381
You don't have to draw there.
You can use my desk.

12:34.453 --> 12:35.715
I don't mind.

12:36.489 --> 12:40.926
Now that you're sleeping better, let's
put the second bed back in Josh's room.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.052
That's Josh's place in the house.

12:43.129 --> 12:44.687
I'll just sleep here.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.528
I'll wake up earlier
so Lori can take a shower.

12:47.633 --> 12:50.397
- It can't be comfortable.
- It is for me.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.233
But it's so cold and hard,

12:53.305 --> 12:55.773
and Lori's hair products
all over the place.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.169
They smell good.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.872
I think it's time you transition
back into a bed.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.073
But I like the tub.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.276
There's something about it.

13:07.086 --> 13:09.179
- It feels...
- Safe?

13:10.823 --> 13:13.758
Yes, but it's more than that.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.656
I don't know.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.463
All right.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.100
We won't push it.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.099
Sleep in the tub.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.697
For now.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.769
May I see?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.172
More of the woods.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.712
It's all that comes out.

13:42.454 --> 13:46.015
Because these images
are very vivid for you.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.290
And we'll find out why in time.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.920
Meanwhile, there's something
I need to show you. Come on.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.670
Think carefully, Kyle.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.070
Does this mean anything to you?

14:06.212 --> 14:08.510
- No.
- Take your time.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.709
Do you recognize it at all?

14:13.986 --> 14:15.886
- Should I?
- I don't know.

14:17.456 --> 14:20.220
Do you think you've
ever seen it before?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.502
No.

14:41.113 --> 14:44.139
Dad, I was on fire at summer school.
Aced every problem.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.650
So algebra's making
more sense to you now?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.653
Yeah.
I need to chill out for awhile.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.882
Let me guess.
With video games.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.753
- Great idea.
- Josh.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.554
Not till your grades improve.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.357
Dad, I'm going through
some serious withdrawal.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.921
If you don't pass summer school
you're not gonna go to high school.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.161
- Is that what you want?
- No.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.398
Then get upstairs and finish that test
you brought home.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.470
Wow. I thought I could be tough.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.772
The kid's smart.
He just needs to focus.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.938
- You through working with Kyle?
- Yeah.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.506
Listen, I have to tell you something.
Try not to get alarmed.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.449
I saw Detective Breen this morning.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.384
The police found...

15:23.355 --> 15:26.256
- What?
- Nothing. We're just talking.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.520
About Kyle?

15:32.097 --> 15:34.861
- Fine. Be that way.
- Hang on, Lori.

15:34.967 --> 15:38.459
Listen, I can't bring Kyle to the office
and Mom has to work.

15:38.537 --> 15:40.300
We need you to watch him tomorrow.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.273
Uh, like, I have to work too, remember?

15:44.343 --> 15:46.106
He can sit near the counter.

15:46.178 --> 15:49.409
Some weird mutant scaring off customers?

15:49.481 --> 15:52.644
It's just for a couple of hours.
I really need your help.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.278
You brought him here.
It's not my job to watch him.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.355
Come on, he's part of the family.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.583
You like to think that,
but he's not.

16:03.762 --> 16:05.286
Sorry.

16:24.783 --> 16:26.307
What are you doing?

16:26.385 --> 16:27.545
Homework.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.143
Homework?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.815
Is that your job?

16:31.890 --> 16:33.653
It's my hell.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.531
X equals 49.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.034
Hey, that's right.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.762
You like math, don't you, Kyle?

16:53.245 --> 16:55.770
- He's linked to a murder?
- Shh. The kids will hear.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.713
What else did Detective Breen say?

16:57.783 --> 16:59.717
He's not sure Kyle is connected.

16:59.785 --> 17:03.551
<i>- Kyle didn't recognize this?
- No. Not yet, anyway.</i>

17:04.289 --> 17:07.348
It's a big coincidence,
him being out there in the same area.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.587
It doesn't mean he's guilty
of anything.

17:09.661 --> 17:13.426
<i>I mean, maybe he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.</i>

17:13.531 --> 17:15.465
Do they have any suspects?

17:15.534 --> 17:16.898
No, not yet.

17:16.969 --> 17:20.336
He said that the killer would probably
have scratches on him.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.335
<i>If Kyle's a witness,
his memory comes back,</i>

17:24.410 --> 17:26.877
<i>- he could identify him.
- It's possible.</i>

17:26.944 --> 17:30.506
<i>He's living with us and some
murderer could be looking for him.</i>

17:30.582 --> 17:33.517
<i>Or he's just a lost boy
who needs a temporary home.</i>

17:46.732 --> 17:48.427
Still at it?

17:48.934 --> 17:50.367
- Done.
- Excellent.

17:50.436 --> 17:51.664
Here you go.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.735
Not bad, not bad.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.571
I'll have to change a few answers.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.907
- Change them?
- I can't get them all right.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.946
They'd know somebody helped me.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.448
- I thought it was good to help.
- It is.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.985
But it has to be a secret.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.949
A secret?

18:09.455 --> 18:10.717
Is that lying?

18:10.789 --> 18:13.724
How could it be lying
if we're not saying anything?

18:45.424 --> 18:46.789
Yes, I showered.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.384
- I'll be ready in a second.
- You finish your test?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.985
I did it last night.
No sweat.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.731
It made the papers.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.737
The other night we found Kyle sitting
next to this spot.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.773
It's so hard to imagine he's involved.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.810
Even if he's not, we still don't know
why he was wandering around the woods.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.675
<i>Vámonos.</i>

19:07.746 --> 19:11.773
First you shower with no complaint and
now you're eager to go to summer school?

19:11.850 --> 19:14.341
- I could stay home all day.
- Oh, nice try.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.910
- Where's Kyle?
- Must have left with Lori.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.219
Wow. She actually did something
we asked her to.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.201
- You ditched out on watching Kyle?
- My parents said to take him to work.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.716
And... I lost my job, remember?

19:44.783 --> 19:48.014
But your parents will be so pissed
when they find out.

19:48.086 --> 19:51.578
They're probably talking right now
about how irresponsible I am

19:51.657 --> 19:55.525
and I can never be trusted to watch Kyle
again, which is fine by me.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.425
I'll watch him for you.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.623
Where's Declan already?

20:05.437 --> 20:07.735
It's so cool that we're stalking him.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.774
We are not stalking him.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.707
We are confirming.

20:14.913 --> 20:18.747
Somehow I can't see him playing
nine holes of golf with his father.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.308
Look, I don't care
if he sees other girls.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.546
I just...

20:23.322 --> 20:25.290
I just want him to be honest with me.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.382
You are so full of it.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.290
I can see other guys too.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.828
That's our arrangement.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.761
Quite the open door policy.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.265
Listen to you.
Slut central.

20:35.334 --> 20:38.497
Come on. We both know you like him
more than you let on.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.732
That doesn't mean that I expect
this big commitment.

21:03.295 --> 21:04.785
Just the truth.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.840
Hello?

21:29.721 --> 21:31.245
Stephen?

21:34.026 --> 21:35.357
Nicole?

21:39.598 --> 21:41.327
Where are you?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.504
<i>In the family
everyone had a place,</i>

21:46.571 --> 21:47.936
<i>a purpose,</i>

21:48.040 --> 21:49.803
<i>something to contribute.</i>

21:49.875 --> 21:53.003
<i>Everyone mattered but me.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:57.440
<i>They didn't even notice
they left me behind.</i>

21:58.717 --> 22:00.878
<i>But then I stumbled on a way
to help them,</i>

22:01.620 --> 22:03.485
<i>to show them I was useful.</i>

23:30.475 --> 23:32.136
How did you do that?

23:32.711 --> 23:33.803
What?

23:34.579 --> 23:36.706
You jumped off the roof.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.747
I had to get down.

23:39.785 --> 23:42.413
People don't do that.
They use ladders.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.452
I don't get you at all.

23:49.961 --> 23:52.122
I am so grounded.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.859
- Your mother will understand.
- Have you met my mom?

23:55.434 --> 23:56.731
Yes.

23:57.402 --> 23:59.563
Kyle, obviously she's gonna punish me.

23:59.671 --> 24:01.400
You just need to explain.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.076
That I saw you jump off the roof?
Even I don't believe it.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.735
But it's the truth.

24:07.546 --> 24:08.877
It doesn't matter.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.042
I thought the truth always matters.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.617
What's happening here?

24:17.556 --> 24:18.818
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

24:18.890 --> 24:20.824
Just a fender bender
with the trash.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.587
How much trouble am I in?

24:23.862 --> 24:26.353
- For leaving you behind.
- Oh, they don't know.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.602
Come on.
We gotta get you inside.

24:45.717 --> 24:48.242
Two thousand square feet,
great yard, schools.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.289
Nursery plus a third bedroom
for another kid if we want one

24:51.389 --> 24:54.552
I want to, but Chloe's
already so tired she can't imagine...

24:54.659 --> 24:57.127
Mark, I know you're excited.

24:57.195 --> 24:59.663
I can't believe they accepted our offer.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.494
Is this the right time to buy a house?

25:01.566 --> 25:04.091
The market is high,
it will be a bit of a stretch...

25:07.305 --> 25:08.966
What?

25:09.608 --> 25:10.836
What's going on?

25:12.644 --> 25:15.807
- Well, uh...
- Thank you.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.042
I was just thinking,
because of the baby and all...

25:19.117 --> 25:21.483
...to pack up and move now...
- Stephen.

25:21.586 --> 25:24.953
We can't breathe in our place anymore,
it's so tight.

25:27.559 --> 25:29.390
Now is the perfect time to move.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.420
Yeah.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.710
<i>- Yes?
- They found Kern.</i>

25:53.251 --> 25:55.378
In the woods, along with his card.

25:55.453 --> 25:57.114
<i>- You were sloppy.
- I was rushed.</i>

25:57.188 --> 25:58.951
<i>Have they identified him yet?</i>

25:59.824 --> 26:02.793
<i>- I've made that difficult.
- It's a matter of time.</i>

26:02.861 --> 26:04.988
Time is what I need to cover my tracks.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.553
<i>Do a betterjob of it.</i>

26:13.672 --> 26:16.106
Lori! I need clothes.

26:26.117 --> 26:28.813
Kyle, it's time for you to learn
about modesty.

26:28.887 --> 26:30.946
- I'm not modest?
- No.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.825
Not Jewish either, apparently.

26:35.527 --> 26:38.291
Put on your clothes and come out.
We need a cover story.

26:38.396 --> 26:40.091
Cover story?

26:40.165 --> 26:42.065
What we tell my parents about today

26:42.133 --> 26:44.067
so they don't know that I lost my job.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.669
You want me to lie?

26:46.738 --> 26:48.103
You could put it that way.

26:51.409 --> 26:54.537
Come on, you're a guy.
Lying should come naturally to you.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.877
- It should?
- Lying's part of your makeup.

26:57.849 --> 27:01.615
- It doesn't feel like it.
- Believe me, men lie. It's a fact.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.847
- A fact?
- And what's even worse...

27:03.922 --> 27:06.891
- Something worse?
- Men want women to lie to them too.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.619
- We do?
- Yes.

27:08.693 --> 27:12.595
Because if we dare tell you the truth,
tried to express how we are feeling,

27:12.664 --> 27:14.029
men freak out.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.829
You'd rather we just keep lying to you
so you don't have to... like, commit.

27:19.270 --> 27:22.171
- I don't understand.
- That makes two of us.

27:33.551 --> 27:35.485
Hey, Kyle, is Mr. Trager home?

27:35.553 --> 27:36.986
No.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.319
You don't know
if he has any touchup paint?

27:39.391 --> 27:40.915
For my car. For the fender.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.655
Not that he'd have any that could match,
but I figured it's worth a shot.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.754
You're talking really fast.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.267
I'm in full-on freak-out mode.
I need something to hide the damage.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.769
- You want to hide it?
- Till I can fix it.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.202
What's up?

27:54.806 --> 27:56.637
I need to camouflage my car.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.677
Just tell her it was parked
and someone nailed it.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.678
- You think?
- Well, yeah.

28:01.746 --> 28:04.112
If you tell her what happened,
you're screwed.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.648
It's a no-win situation.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.652
Mom, I'm so sorry. I don't know
what happened. I've been so careful.

28:11.723 --> 28:14.556
Just like that.
She'll forget all about being mad.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.560
I thought you said men were the liars.

28:18.963 --> 28:20.931
I don't know.
I'm a terrible liar.

28:21.833 --> 28:25.360
Why don't we see if we can
find something to fix it?

28:28.606 --> 28:30.506
My way was better.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.907
What am I doing?
I don't know what I'm looking for.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.811
My mom's gonna have a coronary.

28:39.017 --> 28:41.645
Maybe you can wait
until Stephen gets home.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.614
I don't have time.
My mom's gonna be home in an hour.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.851
If I park by the hedge
she won't notice.

28:48.927 --> 28:50.485
Maybe she won't be that angry.

28:50.595 --> 28:53.428
Kyle, she got me that car
so I'd be responsible.

28:53.498 --> 28:55.762
What will she say
after I crash it in one week?

28:55.834 --> 28:57.165
What will happen?

28:57.235 --> 29:00.671
Oh. Well... She'll take away my car,
my social life.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.708
Besides that, nothing,
except for a long exile to my room.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.867
I think you should tell her.

29:08.146 --> 29:10.706
Not telling her
is making you feel worse.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.111
Wish me luck.

29:14.953 --> 29:16.318
How do I do that?

29:16.421 --> 29:18.753
You just say, "Good luck. "

29:19.724 --> 29:21.453
Good luck.

29:33.338 --> 29:37.104
Kyle got to go to the coffee shop today.
How did it go, Lori? Any problems?

29:39.043 --> 29:40.670
No. It was great.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.805
He just sat there near the counter
and drew the whole time,

29:43.882 --> 29:45.975
just like you said he would.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.078
How did you like it there, Kyle?

29:50.288 --> 29:52.654
<i>It was so hard
to look Nicole in the eye.</i>

29:54.159 --> 29:55.319
I think he was lonely.

29:55.426 --> 29:57.656
It's probably not
the best place for him.

30:00.398 --> 30:02.161
I can take Kyle to school with me.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.633
He'll sit right by me, read along.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.000
It'll be fun, right, Kyle?

30:07.071 --> 30:08.971
<i>My mouth began to feel dry.</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:10.974
It's not supposed to be fun, Josh.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.405
By the way, how did your test go?

30:13.478 --> 30:15.105
I passed.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.711
Yeah, all that hard work
really paid off.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.810
<i>They spun their stories
with ease and conviction.</i>

30:22.887 --> 30:25.856
<i>By staying silent was I lying too?</i>

30:25.924 --> 30:27.255
Sure you didn't cheat?

30:27.325 --> 30:29.350
<i>I could feel my heart pound.</i>

30:29.427 --> 30:31.793
Lori, just be happy Josh is doing well.

30:31.863 --> 30:34.832
Mom, think maybe I could play
some video games tonight?

30:37.101 --> 30:39.262
Yeah, I think you've earned a reward.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.999
<i>Until finally
I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

30:43.274 --> 30:45.538
I took the test for Josh.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.341
- I knew it.
- He's lying.

30:48.446 --> 30:50.004
It's the truth.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.845
And I wasn't at the coffee bar.
I was here all by myself.

30:52.917 --> 30:55.010
- Shut up, Kyle.
- Why didn't you take him?

30:55.086 --> 30:57.111
I got fired, OK?
Thanks a lot.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.486
Yeah, Kyle,
I thought you were my friend.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.821
I never wanted you here to begin with.

31:03.895 --> 31:07.387
- Kyle, they don't mean that.
- No, you did the right thing.

31:09.100 --> 31:11.466
Then why does it feel so wrong?

31:45.069 --> 31:47.162
- How'd you get up here?
- Climbed.

31:48.106 --> 31:50.074
Climbed? How?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.507
Nice up here.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.485
Private.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.787
Out of the way.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.021
I'm in the way.

32:09.093 --> 32:10.958
No, that's not true.

32:11.029 --> 32:12.553
Yes.

32:12.630 --> 32:15.565
No. Lori and Josh
didn't mean what they said.

32:18.202 --> 32:20.033
All I wanted to do was help them.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.631
Lying's not the way.
Like I told you, tell the truth.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.335
No matter what.

32:28.413 --> 32:31.382
- Telling the truth can hurt.
- Yeah.

32:32.383 --> 32:33.941
Sometimes.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.923
But you still shouldn't lie
just to protect people.

32:39.023 --> 32:41.253
But allowing people to be hurt...

32:42.994 --> 32:44.757
...is that all right?

33:07.552 --> 33:08.917
Hey.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.020
I'm sorry I didn't watch Kyle.

33:13.091 --> 33:15.651
I guess I was afraid to tell you guys
I got fired.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.489
Why?

33:17.562 --> 33:20.326
Why did I get fired
or why was I afraid to tell you?

33:20.398 --> 33:21.956
Take your pick.

33:23.301 --> 33:27.067
I blew off a shift, and I know it
was wrong, so please spare the lecture.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.798
Lori,

33:33.177 --> 33:35.304
I hope you know
you can tell me anything.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.507
Now, I'm not just saying that.

33:37.582 --> 33:41.814
Just... whatever you're going through,
I have the feeling I've been there too.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.581
This is one of those
"when I was your age" speeches?

33:45.690 --> 33:48.022
Well, the fact is, I was your age once.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.219
Not that long ago.

33:50.828 --> 33:54.594
Some styles may have changed,
but the basics...

33:56.434 --> 33:59.164
I think I still have
a pretty good handle on it.

34:00.071 --> 34:03.507
Did you ever wish
that somebody felt the way that you did?

34:04.142 --> 34:05.439
Which time?

34:10.248 --> 34:11.737
One thing I've learned...

34:12.483 --> 34:15.577
...you can't make anybody
feel the way you'd like them to.

34:17.155 --> 34:20.056
If they do, it's wonderful.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.088
And if they don't,

34:24.027 --> 34:25.393
you move on.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.907
Brad. It's Stephen.

34:37.975 --> 34:39.408
What's up?

34:40.078 --> 34:43.013
In the morning I'm telling
the staff about the layoffs.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.380
- You can't do that.
- They deserve to know the truth.

34:46.451 --> 34:50.217
<i>- If you say anything, Trager...
- What? You'll fire me too?</i>

34:50.321 --> 34:54.223
You won't have to. I'll quit. And I'll
take my software and patents with me.

34:54.891 --> 34:57.918
All right.
Don't get carried away.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.530
Come in tomorrow
and you can break the bad news to them.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.931
Bye.

35:10.174 --> 35:13.735
- I can explain.
- I trusted you with this car, Amanda.

35:13.811 --> 35:17.178
- You promised to be careful.
- It was an accident. I'm sorry.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.010
What happened?

35:19.083 --> 35:21.643
- I was... I was...
- I did it.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.277
I broke the car.

35:23.387 --> 35:24.854
What are you doing?

35:26.858 --> 35:30.123
- That's not what happened.
- Do not cover for him, Amanda.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.628
- I'm not. He's lying.
- It's the truth.

35:34.198 --> 35:37.065
OK. You listen to me very carefully.

35:37.135 --> 35:41.162
I want you to stay away
from my property and my daughter.

35:44.175 --> 35:45.642
Come on, Amanda.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.045
Now.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.814
<i>This lie was easy...</i>

35:57.989 --> 36:00.480
<i>...because I knew it was
the right thing to do.</i>

36:04.762 --> 36:07.322
- Surfing for porn?
- I wish.

36:08.099 --> 36:10.363
No Internet, no Xbox for a week.

36:11.068 --> 36:14.128
- You?
- I got the "mature" discussion.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.935
So not fair.

36:27.218 --> 36:28.742
Kyle.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.453
I completely suck.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.186
I didn't mean what I said and I should
never have asked you to cover for me.

36:36.260 --> 36:38.820
- Lie for you.
- Zip it, cheater.

36:38.896 --> 36:41.592
Hey, if you're gonna apologize,
make it accurate.

36:41.666 --> 36:44.100
At least I'm apologizing.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.532
I'm sorry.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.840
- We got busted.
- Josh!

36:57.215 --> 37:00.343
And, uh... you can still be my friend.

37:00.418 --> 37:02.318
You are so unbelievably lame.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.878
It's OK. I think I understand
about lying now.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.884
We will never ask you
to lie for us again,

37:09.961 --> 37:11.724
but can we trust you not to narc?

37:14.432 --> 37:18.459
To keep things just between us.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.695
You can trust me.

37:26.210 --> 37:29.179
I think we all learned
a very valuable lesson today.

37:38.956 --> 37:41.424
- All set.
- You're sure about this?

37:41.492 --> 37:43.050
You don't mind giving it up?

37:43.160 --> 37:46.857
I hardly use it anymore.
Besides, it's important for Kyle.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.956
Mom, Dad!

37:49.033 --> 37:51.467
I need you.

37:52.403 --> 37:54.132
Kyle, come on, already!

37:56.641 --> 37:58.131
Kyle locked the door again?

37:58.209 --> 37:59.540
Not for long.

38:00.745 --> 38:01.871
Ta-da.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.908
Too bad they don't give A's
for breaking and entering.

38:04.982 --> 38:07.473
- And theft.
- I didn't charge anything on it.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.451
- Shouldn't you be studying?
- I will.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.887
If you don't pass on your own,
I'll tell the school you cheated.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.480
My own mother?

38:17.361 --> 38:19.921
I can't wait for Kyle every morning
so I can shower.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.397
- You won't have to worry about that.
- Why?

38:22.500 --> 38:24.991
Just use our shower today.
I'll tell you later.

38:25.069 --> 38:27.333
And when you're done,
you're on the clock.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.102
When's my first break?

38:31.876 --> 38:34.401
You sure paying her to watch Kyle
is a good idea?

38:34.478 --> 38:36.844
She needs a job.
He needs supervision.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.514
Kyle.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.686
Time to get up.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.330
We've got a surprise for you.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.996
OK.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.565
Open them.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.253
What do you think?

39:38.976 --> 39:40.739
What happened to the workshop?

39:41.712 --> 39:43.646
It's not my workshop anymore.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.779
- It's your room.
- Mine?

39:48.452 --> 39:49.885
All yours.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.381
Do you like it?

39:57.294 --> 40:00.786
<i>In that moment I felt
I finally had a place here.</i>

40:00.865 --> 40:02.389
<i>I belonged.</i>

40:10.508 --> 40:11.736
Thank you.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.306
You're welcome.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.184
So... let's go get some breakfast.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.450
You guys go on.
I'm gonna set up a little.
