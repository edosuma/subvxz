we have two weeks.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.505
The venue is paid for

04:33.540 --> 04:36.508

11:34.995 --> 11:37.629
It's not all glamor
and designer shoes.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.132
Jimmy Choos?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.635
Okay, fine.
I have nice shoes.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.204
But you still don't understand
how hard my life really is.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.040
You have carpools
and teacher lounges.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.177
Your weekends are spa visits
and fancy parties.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.512
That is all work.
I have no personal life.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.614
'I'm exhausted.'

11:56.650 --> 11:58.283
Quite frankly,
running Winter Wonderland

11:58.318 --> 12:00.685
in my sweat pants
sounds like a vacation.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.687
Oh. That is so typical.

12:02.723 --> 12:06.291
You have never appreciated
how hard it is to do what I do.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.060
I would love to be
pampered and pretty all day

12:09.096 --> 12:11.463
while planning a party
with full creative control.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.832
I would rock it.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.867
- Really?
- Really.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.838
Prove it.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.141
How? Doing..

12:25.345 --> 12:26.911
Oh, come on.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.981
We haven't done that since
the infamous Tom Kinder fiasco.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.085
- We'd get caught.
- I wouldn't.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.054
Piper and Gabe would know.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.256
Although, it is Blake's week
to have them.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.992
No.. This is absurd.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.328
[sighs]
Whatever you think.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.030
[sighs]

12:47.768 --> 12:49.934
Don't you have a ton
of meetings?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.436
No.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.749
Miss Aldrin made sure this party

12:52.773 --> 12:55.573
is my <i> number one</i> project.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.410
Is school almost out?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.780
Today was the first day break.

13:03.750 --> 13:04.949
It could be fun.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.086
- It would be crazy.
- Maybe.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.122
But mom did want us
to spend more time together.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.630
(Kate)
'We'll do a test run
this afternoon.'

13:18.665 --> 13:20.999
'If at any point it looks like
we're gonna get caught'

13:21.034 --> 13:23.635
'we end this.'

13:23.670 --> 13:26.137
(Chris)
'Ugh, are these a size two?'

13:26.173 --> 13:27.693
(Kate)
'Just say you spilled
something.'

13:38.351 --> 13:39.717
[sighs]

13:41.288 --> 13:44.222
[instrumental music]

13:52.199 --> 13:54.165
Stand up straighter.
Look..

13:55.368 --> 13:56.701
Bossy?

13:56.736 --> 13:58.102
Authoritative.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.405
[sighs]

14:03.009 --> 14:05.777
[chuckles]
Boy, you never
listened to mom.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.145
Seriously?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.685
Well, check your e-mail.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.954
I sent you a quick note
on what you can expect.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.458
[scoffs]

14:20.493 --> 14:22.160
"A quick note?"

14:22.195 --> 14:24.429
Those are bullet points,
and it's color coordinated.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.966
Well, it will
get you through the day.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.934
Is what I gave you enough?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.972
I'll figure it out.
We'll check in after.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.443
[instrumental music]

14:47.621 --> 14:50.555
[indistinct chatter]

14:55.262 --> 14:56.494
[elevator dings]

15:00.400 --> 15:01.799
Let me help.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.169
Oh.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.572
Jeans, huh?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.909
Oh, I, I, um,
I spilled coffee.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.011
[chuckles]
Happens to me all the time.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.413
There you go.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.382
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.055
- See you, Kate.
- Yeah. Thanks... you.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.332
[instrumental music]

15:44.177 --> 15:47.245
Chris, you're on time
for a change.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.148
Principal Sumner,
you're not alone.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.816
No, I am not.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.720
Chris Dixon, I want you to meet
our generous new sponsor

15:55.755 --> 15:57.121
'Tom Kinder.'

15:58.124 --> 15:59.457
Hello.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.066
I'm sorry, it..
You just look familiar.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.568
Have we met before?

16:10.603 --> 16:13.171
Um, I don't,
I don't know where from.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.939
- I felt..
- Um..

16:14.975 --> 16:17.675
But maybe
you've met my sister.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.310
Kate Lockhart?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.580
Well, that's funny.

16:22.615 --> 16:26.484
I-I have met your sister
a-a long time ago.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.319
Chris is the head
of our Art Department.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.155
And she's been a part of
the Winter Wonderland planning

16:31.191 --> 16:32.957
for the past ten years.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.427
- Oh, well, that explains it.
- Explains what?

16:36.463 --> 16:37.773
Well, I've been lookin'
at the plans

16:37.797 --> 16:39.430
for the carnival for this year

16:39.466 --> 16:41.366
and I realized
that they look exactly the same

16:41.401 --> 16:43.534
as all the plans
for the last decade.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.669
[chuckles]

16:44.704 --> 16:46.938
Well, it's perfected.

16:46.973 --> 16:50.641
Well, I would argue that
they're a little bit... stale.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.543
But I figure with, uh,
my donation

16:52.579 --> 16:54.712
we can, we can expand this year.

16:54.748 --> 16:57.548
- That's a wonderful idea.
- Ah, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:57.584 --> 17:01.152
Um, the event is
less than two weeks away

17:01.187 --> 17:02.620
from being executed.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.188
- Plenty of time.
- Yeah, we'll..

17:04.223 --> 17:05.723
We're gonna make it
a priority.

17:05.759 --> 17:06.991
- 'The top.'
- Oh, hold on...

17:07.027 --> 17:08.326
You know what we should do?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.494
We should get together,
go over some ideas.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.196
- Get together?
- Great!

17:13.233 --> 17:15.833
Oh, wait,
my in-laws are in town.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.368
Chris will go to your place.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.505
Uh, dad, we're gonna be late
for dinner.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.339
Dylan, come here,
I want you to meet, uh

17:22.375 --> 17:24.375
two members of your new
school's faculty.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.911
This is Principal Sumner

17:26.945 --> 17:28.813
and this is Ms. Dixon.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.016
Dylan Kinder, uh,
new freshman this year.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.921
- A delight to meet you, Dylan.
- Hi, Dylan.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.157
Well, we're going over
to my cousin's place for dinner

17:39.192 --> 17:43.561
um, so, what do you think
tomorrow afternoon?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.164
- 'Perfect.'
- Okay. Good.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.966
Well, nice to meet you,
uh, Chris. Okay.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.605
That went well!

17:54.641 --> 17:56.007
Yeah.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.046
[instrumental music]

18:06.719 --> 18:08.619
- Hey.
- Huh! Oh.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.456
- You okay?
- Yes, fine.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.459
How may I help you, uh, Emily?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.526
[Emily chuckles]

18:15.562 --> 18:16.961
Um... I was just coming

18:16.996 --> 18:18.463
to make sure you got the calls

18:18.498 --> 18:20.431
that came in while you were
at your brunch.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.866
Yes, thank you.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.870
Seriously, are you okay?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.573
I-I'm just looking
at this Christmas party

18:28.608 --> 18:30.108
the office manager left.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.909
She hardly did anything.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.144
[knocks]

18:33.179 --> 18:34.979
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.826
(Greg)
'So, I noticed
this little puppy didn't quite'

18:36.850 --> 18:39.550
make it back into the tote.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.918
- Oh! Ooh.
- Oh!

18:42.322 --> 18:43.921
(Greg)
'Mm.'

18:43.957 --> 18:45.089
I'm fine.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.757
You should probably ice that.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.093
Yeah. Ooh!

18:49.129 --> 18:50.761
Oh, hey, the rumors are true,
huh?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.108
You're in charge
of the Christmas party?

18:52.132 --> 18:54.632
Oh, well,
somebody has to do it.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.468
Good luck. And try to avoid
Poetry Slam Santa again.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.837
That's a thing?

18:59.873 --> 19:01.939
You don't remember?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.842
Oh, I..
Yeah, must have blocked it out.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.277
[chuckles]
Wise.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.514
Um, hey, d-do you,
uh, have any suggestions

19:09.549 --> 19:11.249
for what the people might like?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.851
I mean, I-I have a lot of ideas.

19:13.887 --> 19:17.088
I have a ton of ideas,
but you know the office better.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.491
I doubt that. You've been here
longer than I have.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.161
Oh, um,
you have a little s-smudge.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.829
Oh.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.809
Hazards of being an architect
who likes to do things

19:26.833 --> 19:27.833
the old-fashioned way.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.267
Excuse me.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.801
Your sister called,
and she wants you

19:30.837 --> 19:32.670
to call her back
from your cell from

19:32.705 --> 19:35.273
and I'm quoting,
"A secure location, ASAP."

19:38.845 --> 19:41.312
What.. How much
does he wanna change it?

19:41.347 --> 19:44.048
Well, more than I bargained for,
which was none.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.651
Apparently,
Tom has all these ideas.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.452
Are you sure
this is the same guy

19:48.488 --> 19:50.454
you had a crush on
all those years ago?

19:50.490 --> 19:53.224
Positive.
He recognized me too.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.626
Well, as you.

19:55.662 --> 19:59.630
And did your insta-crush return
like when you guys were young?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.066
No. What..
No, of course not.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.068
Well, I remember
that you were really upset

20:04.103 --> 20:05.303
when he stood you up.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.837
Yeah, that was a long time ago.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.073
Okay, well, anyway,
we'll end the switch.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.686
And I'll probably
get to know him pretty well

20:10.710 --> 20:12.643
since we'll be working
at the carnival together.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.011
So if you want,
I can just..

20:14.047 --> 20:16.013
I can introduce you two
when it's over.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.651
- Or..
- 'Or?'

20:22.422 --> 20:23.888
We could keep going.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.524
Wait, what do..
What do you mean? You want..

20:26.559 --> 20:29.393
You want to keep going
with the switch?

20:29.429 --> 20:32.029
Well... yeah, I mean,
I've been wanting to hang around

20:32.065 --> 20:34.031
in sweats for a while.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.667
Ha-ha. No, seriously.
The changes.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.769
Are you up for that?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.572
Yeah, I don't think
it'll be that big of a deal.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.708
Are you up for keeping going?

20:46.279 --> 20:47.645
Oh..

20:48.648 --> 20:50.014
Absolutely.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.552
[instrumental music]

20:56.923 --> 21:00.424
(Kate)
'Oh, I forgot how much Littleton
likes to do up Christmas.'

21:02.495 --> 21:03.961
[sighs]

21:03.997 --> 21:06.931
Our lives could not be
any more different.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.532
(Chris)
'No kidding.'

21:09.902 --> 21:11.302
'When did that happen?'

21:11.337 --> 21:13.137
(Kate)
'High school. Senior Year.'

21:13.172 --> 21:14.939
We took different paths.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.941
But we kept on going.

21:16.976 --> 21:21.045
Last chance. Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

21:21.080 --> 21:23.147
Well, it's only
a few days, and..

21:23.182 --> 21:25.916
Well, after tomorrow, Gabe
and Piper will be with Blake

21:25.952 --> 21:27.385
'so you're all set.'

21:27.420 --> 21:28.420
Good.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.054
'Are you okay?'

21:34.327 --> 21:35.760
I am.

21:35.795 --> 21:39.096
Alright.
Well, good luck, Chris.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.798
Good luck, Kate.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.844
[door closes]

21:53.880 --> 21:56.080
Merry Christmas!

21:56.115 --> 21:57.448
[door closes]

22:01.521 --> 22:03.087
Merry Christmas!

[growling]

22:15.635 --> 22:16.667
[barks]

22:18.671 --> 22:20.004
Hi, Happy.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.241
- Oh, hey, Piper.
- Hey.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.913
We're out of peanut butter.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.749
[whimpering]

22:33.753 --> 22:35.519
And so it begins.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.460
[alarm beeping]

22:57.744 --> 22:59.043
[sighs]

22:59.078 --> 23:01.278
[alarm rings]

23:15.395 --> 23:16.727
Mm.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.796
Oh.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.004
Oh, Chris.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.243
[chuckles]

23:31.277 --> 23:33.043
Kate.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.412
Wow.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.753
Hmm.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.722
And this I could get used to.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.762
Huh! Now I could get
used to this.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.464
[whimpering]

23:53.499 --> 23:55.433
I promise,
the food's the same.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.940
Okay.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.010
"Feed dog, breakfast.."

24:08.614 --> 24:09.747
Oh.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.785
[instrumental music]

24:39.946 --> 24:41.579
Healthy.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.886
How do you even cook that?

24:52.792 --> 24:54.492
Oh! Shoot!

25:02.568 --> 25:04.668
Oh.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.604
[Happy whimpering]

25:06.639 --> 25:08.005
Don't judge me.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.613
Oh, good morning.

25:15.648 --> 25:19.250
Sorry, the bacon's
a little bit... burnt.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.790
- So...
- Can I have a glass of milk?

25:27.927 --> 25:29.293
Sure.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.640
So, your father, he's...

25:42.675 --> 25:44.341
Strawberry and yogurt, please.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.910
What? Who..

25:45.945 --> 25:48.112
Oh, sure, yogurt.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.589
- Okay. So...
- Oh, that's two percent.

25:58.624 --> 26:01.225
I drink whole milk.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.794
Right. Whole milk.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.946
I need a spoon.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.347
Mm-hmm.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.120
Where's the eggs?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.555
Eggs!

26:33.926 --> 26:35.059
Mm-hmm.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.661
Uh..

26:41.834 --> 26:44.969
Now, before you tell me
this isn't how you eat your eggs

26:45.004 --> 26:46.982
your father is going to be here
any minute to pick you up

26:47.006 --> 26:48.472
and I hope that you've packed

26:48.507 --> 26:49.618
and I'm sure you're gonna
have a great time

26:49.642 --> 26:51.141
and I love you both.

26:51.177 --> 26:52.910
Dad's not coming.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.645
- He's not?
- Change of plans.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.047
- 'He can't take us this week.'
- What?

26:57.083 --> 26:59.249
So, we'll be here, all week.

27:00.987 --> 27:04.288
Here, all week?

27:04.323 --> 27:07.558
Oh. Wow! That's unexpected.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.094
I'm gonna make a phone call.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.062
To who?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.598
Uh, my sister.

27:14.634 --> 27:18.002
I'm going to see if my sister's
up for a visit.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.771
- She's too busy.
- Aunt Kate's always too busy.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.807
What.. What..
No, that's not how it is.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.810
Aunt Kate..
Her life is..

27:26.846 --> 27:28.812
She's..

27:28.848 --> 27:32.583
Okay, she's really busy, but
she loves you very, very much.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.652
It doesn't matter.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.087
- It doesn't matter?
- Because you're here.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.756
And we're so excited to spend

27:38.791 --> 27:40.457
all of our vacation time
together.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.326
- Playing video games.
- And shopping.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.328
- Ice skating.
- Singing carols.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.297
♪ Oh Christmas tree
oh Christmas tree ♪♪

27:47.333 --> 27:50.100
Wait a second.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.771
Okay, okay, when did you guys
figure it out?

27:53.806 --> 27:55.472
When mom called to tell us.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.841
- She told you?
- We would've known.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.977
You're twins.
You're not clones.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.514
Well, okay, you can ha-ha
all the way to your father's.

28:03.549 --> 28:06.383
- Oh, no, that part was true.
- We're staying here.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.419
There's no way
we'd miss this.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.993
Of course, I told them. I'm not
gonna lie to my children.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.328
Yeah, but now they wanna
stay here all week.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.331
How am I supposed to juggle them
and Winter Wonderland?

28:21.367 --> 28:25.069
[chuckles]
Well, you're the one who wanted
to walk in my shoes. Oh.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.072
Um, but hey, if you don't think
you can handle it..

28:28.107 --> 28:31.075
Uh, that tactic
does not work on me.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.876
Well, let me know
'cause I'm almost there.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.414
Let me just see how the meeting
with Tom and Sumner goes.

28:37.450 --> 28:38.782
Okay.

28:44.356 --> 28:47.458
Okay. You guys wanna stay here?
That's fine.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.259
But there are gonna be
some changes.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.109
- That's a lot of pink.
- Ha-ha.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.811
I'm not sure what to get my
niece, so I'm ridin' the cliché.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.547
- Oh, how old is she?
- Uh, eight.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.816
Oh, yeah,
that's a tough age.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.651
'Cause they're
out of the cuddly stage

29:14.687 --> 29:17.221
but they haven't quite entered
the terrible teens yet.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.896
I didn't know
you knew so much about kids.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.326
Well, my sister
has two children.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.627
- Oh.
- Yeah.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.229
She talks about them
all the time.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.865
Which reminds me,
I need to go shopping for them.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.967
So no gift cards
from Aunty Kate?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.702
Uh, no, no.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.937
Aunty Kate is gonna be
a lot more involved this year.

29:38.778 --> 29:39.877
What's that?

29:39.912 --> 29:42.579
I believe
they're known as towels.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.381
I thought we could
fold them together.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.750
A little family bonding time.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.352
But mom does laundry.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.020
Well, your mother's not here.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.388
And I'm not doing it alone.

to earn your keep.

Whoa! What's that?

30:27.626 --> 30:29.426
Oh, it's my
Christmas Dream Board.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.529
Yeah, I have so many ideas
stored up

30:32.565 --> 30:35.532
but I have to visualize
before I actualize.

30:35.568 --> 30:36.934
Hey, go..

30:36.969 --> 30:40.671
- Oh, hey, a dream board. Cool!
- Yeah.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.744
Hey, so, um, no biggie,
I'm gonna cut out early though.

30:47.780 --> 30:50.914
Go shopping for my niece.
You know, it's kinda slow.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.950
And I thought maybe
you'd like to come with.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.063
In that way you could shop
for your niece and nephew too

30:55.087 --> 30:57.454
and maybe help out
a poor uncle?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.859
- I'll grab my purse.
- Okay.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.129
[instrumental music]

31:08.367 --> 31:10.934
Hey, why don't you just
put those in the dishwasher?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.569
It's broken.

31:12.605 --> 31:13.849
Mom's been meaning
to get it fixed

31:13.873 --> 31:15.305
but she's been too busy.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.574
Oh, that will not do.

31:17.610 --> 31:18.942
[doorbell rings]

31:20.279 --> 31:21.745
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.985
What's that?

31:28.020 --> 31:30.320
Cookies for today's meeting.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.089
Ah, ah, ah.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.991
Why didn't you make 'em
yourself?

31:35.394 --> 31:36.760
You're adorable.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.301
So, uh, I checked
with my brother

31:44.336 --> 31:47.304
apparently Zoe's going through
a big science phase lately.

31:47.339 --> 31:50.307
- Oh, a STEM girl.
- Hm?

31:50.342 --> 31:52.476
Science, technology,
engineering, and math.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.311
Yeah.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.213
Yeah, have you considered
getting her a tour

31:56.248 --> 31:59.182
of the Denver Museum
For Nature And Science?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.818
It's really cool. Yeah.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.654
I could get you
a schedule if you want.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.756
And she's artistic too.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.960
What other secrets
are you hiding, Kate Lockhart?

32:14.033 --> 32:17.000
Winter Wonderland is less than
two weeks away now.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.037
Embrace the opportunity
for change next year.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.072
Yes, the time crunch
is an issue

32:22.107 --> 32:24.227
but that doesn't mean
we can't make some improvements.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.476
Take the ice skating rink.

32:26.512 --> 32:27.923
What's wrong with
the ice skating rink?

32:27.947 --> 32:29.546
People love ice skating.

32:29.581 --> 32:32.249
Chris, we agreed
the ice rink was out

32:32.284 --> 32:33.750
the first year you took over.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.419
We did?

32:35.454 --> 32:38.622
I mean, of-of course we did.

32:39.858 --> 32:43.026
- Why?
- It was too expensive.

32:43.062 --> 32:46.263
Well, now it's not.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.398
Uh, just out of curiosity

32:48.434 --> 32:51.068
why is having
the ice skating rink back

32:51.103 --> 32:53.503
so important to you?

32:53.539 --> 32:55.517
You know, I have fond memories
of ice skating there.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.641
Knock, knock! It's me.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.279
Katie, what are you doin' here?

33:02.314 --> 33:05.115
Well.. Dad.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.750
We really have to
get his eyesight

33:06.785 --> 33:08.051
prescription pre-checked.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.419
It's Chris!

33:09.455 --> 33:11.488
Excuse us one second.

33:16.729 --> 33:19.596
Dad, how did you know it was me?

33:19.631 --> 33:20.931
[chuckles]
I'm your father.

33:20.966 --> 33:23.266
It's literally my job
to tell you apart.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.436
What's goin' on?

33:26.472 --> 33:28.972
Okay, remember in
Mrs. Paulson's trig class

33:29.008 --> 33:31.475
when Chris and I,
we kinda got caught?

33:31.510 --> 33:35.112
Oh, you're not doin'
the twin sister switch again?

33:35.147 --> 33:37.914
Well, you said you wanted us
to spend more time together.

33:37.950 --> 33:40.150
Yeah, but I thought
you'd go shopping

33:40.185 --> 33:42.552
or get your nail done,
not this.

33:42.588 --> 33:43.987
It's just until
Winter Wonderland

33:44.023 --> 33:45.622
and then we're switching back.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.392
But why?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.594
Well, Chris was comparing
how my life

33:50.629 --> 33:52.496
is so much easier than hers.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.499
Oh, and then you countered
with her life is easier.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.567
Yeah, but then,
it turned into a way

33:57.603 --> 33:59.636
for Chris to have
the freedom to plan

33:59.671 --> 34:01.738
the kind of Christmas party
she's always wanted to

34:01.774 --> 34:05.409
and, and I could get out
of planning my office one.

34:05.444 --> 34:08.145
But at this point, I think
it wasn't the best decision

34:08.179 --> 34:10.781
because I may have gone from
the frying pan into the fire.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.417
Sorry to interrupt.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.186
I have to go pick up Dylan
from my cousin's.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.489
Uh, Tom Kinder,
this is my father, Ed Lockhart.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.860
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.996
I'm just gonna go in
and say hi to the kids, Chris.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.569
How bad is your dad's eyesight?

34:33.806 --> 34:36.139
Well, in his defense

34:36.175 --> 34:37.841
Kate and I are identical twins.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.011
Twins?

34:41.045 --> 34:42.446
Yeah, didn't I..

34:42.481 --> 34:45.649
I mean,
didn't Kate tell you that

34:45.684 --> 34:47.884
she had an identical
twin sister?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.485
Oh, man,
I only met her the one time

34:49.521 --> 34:53.623
but I think that's something
that I would've recalled.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.059
Half your lights are out.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.062
Oh. Well, they're gonna
have to stay that way.

34:59.098 --> 35:01.364
Since someone decided

35:01.400 --> 35:03.366
to make some improvements
to Winter Wonderland

35:03.402 --> 35:05.869
at the last minute.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.171
I'll make it up to ya.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.539
See ya.

[instrumental music]

35:23.989 --> 35:26.523
[sighs]
Looks like I did
more shopping than you.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.994
So, how goes
the Christmas party planning?

35:31.029 --> 35:32.362
Uh, slow.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.864
Do you need
some help with that?

35:33.899 --> 35:35.298
'I mean,
it's the least I can do'

35:35.334 --> 35:36.666
after you pitched in
for me today.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.136
- Well, I...
- 'I mean..'

35:39.171 --> 35:40.348
'Unless you'd prefer
to work alone'

35:40.372 --> 35:42.005
which I totally respect.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.507
I just, um..

35:43.542 --> 35:45.509
I think we w-work well together.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.146
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:55.053 --> 35:57.854
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

36:01.593 --> 36:04.794
- What's that?
- This is pressed juice.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.431
Your arteries
will thank me later.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.200
Tom.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.035
I figured fixing
your Christmas lights

36:45.070 --> 36:46.870
was the least I could do.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.914
[cell phone ringing]

37:00.085 --> 37:01.651
- Hello.
- Hey.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.498
Last minute notice,
I know, but.. Oh, thanks, Mas.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.988
Are you available
for some lunch?

37:05.023 --> 37:07.123
'Maybe some Christmas party
brainstorming?'

37:07.159 --> 37:08.770
I've had these ideas buzzin'
through my head all morning.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.160
We're running short on time.

37:10.195 --> 37:12.662
Um, yeah, sure,
I'm-I'm just decorating my sis..

37:12.698 --> 37:15.098
Um, the condo.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.634
I could swing by,
I mean, unless..

37:17.669 --> 37:20.303
- Am I being too pushy?
- No. Uh..

37:20.339 --> 37:21.638
No, I'd love the company.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.240
Alright. I'll be right there.

37:26.478 --> 37:29.412
[instrumental music]

37:31.984 --> 37:33.350
Oh.

Why do they call it
a Lights Walk?

like to try to outdo each other

48:30.108 --> 48:33.776
But we are gonna make <i> certain</i>
that Jasper..

48:33.811 --> 48:36.612
- 'Tower.'
- Tower Properties..

48:36.648 --> 48:38.948
Will be our most successful
venture to date.

48:38.983 --> 48:43.085
Is our most
successful... venture.

48:43.121 --> 48:46.522
(Jasper)
I hope so. I've got a lot
invested in these condos.

48:46.557 --> 48:49.091
Uh-oh, condos.

48:49.127 --> 48:52.862
Oh, yeah. This is right near
the condo where I'm staying.

48:52.897 --> 48:55.298
Oh, own.
The condo I own.

48:55.333 --> 48:56.532
It's right across the street.

48:56.567 --> 48:59.235
You know,
my friend Haley Blevins

48:59.270 --> 49:02.305
she just moved in here.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.107
Oh, she moved into Denver
from Littleton

49:05.143 --> 49:07.209
and they were complaining
how hard it was to find

49:07.245 --> 49:09.412
a really good place
next to good schools.

49:09.447 --> 49:10.447
Chris!

49:10.481 --> 49:11.781
She said that the real estate

49:11.816 --> 49:13.249
was geared towards singles

49:13.284 --> 49:14.917
'and hipsters.'

49:14.953 --> 49:16.786
- Chris!
- Like mine is.

49:18.489 --> 49:20.289
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.104
But have you ever thought
about changing the design

49:24.128 --> 49:25.628
'and making it more
family-friendly?'

49:25.663 --> 49:26.696
[clears throat]

49:28.132 --> 49:29.432
You don't think it is?

49:29.467 --> 49:30.733
We.. Well, no.

49:30.768 --> 49:32.134
'I mean, look at this kitchen'

49:32.170 --> 49:33.436
I mean, it's so tiny.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.171
'I mean, you can't have a..'

49:35.206 --> 49:37.440
...a family Christmas dinner
in a kitchen that small.

49:37.475 --> 49:40.676
You need more counter space
and you need an island in there

49:40.712 --> 49:42.912
so everyone can
gather around and talk.

49:42.947 --> 49:45.081
And then, see that wall there,
that's blocking

49:45.116 --> 49:47.083
the view into the living room.

49:47.118 --> 49:48.818
And when it's Christmas morning

49:48.853 --> 49:51.420
and you're doing everything,
you wanna watch your kids

49:51.456 --> 49:53.589
opening their presents
next to the Christmas tree.

49:53.624 --> 49:55.691
I mean, that's really important.

49:55.727 --> 49:57.259
I guess I haven't
thought about that.

49:57.295 --> 50:00.262
We <i> could</i> move the kitchen
against the east wall

50:00.298 --> 50:02.164
create a window,
and then get rid of that wall.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.934
- That-that's a simple solution.
- Yeah.

50:04.969 --> 50:06.669
Yeah, and it would be so pretty

50:06.704 --> 50:09.038
'cause you could see
the sunrise at breakfast.

50:09.073 --> 50:12.808
Guess I figured I'd just
go after the tech boom people.

50:12.844 --> 50:14.477
Guess everybody else did
as well.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.056
(Kate on phone)
'Yeah, I warned him about that.'

50:16.080 --> 50:17.780
Which you did warn me about.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.650
You think this'll help
with presales?

50:21.686 --> 50:24.553
Tell him we'll,
we will do a market analysis

50:24.589 --> 50:26.700
'of the change in demographics,
but I think this could be'

50:26.724 --> 50:28.124
'exactly what we need'

50:28.159 --> 50:29.792
'to get this project
off and running.'

50:31.195 --> 50:32.461
Yes.

50:36.067 --> 50:37.900
I'm gonna be a family man.

50:37.935 --> 50:39.101
I love it!

50:40.405 --> 50:42.538

51:12.703 --> 51:14.570

52:13.231 --> 52:15.131
finally getting
into the spirit of things.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.933
Oh, I once went
to an ice hotel in Norway.

52:17.969 --> 52:21.403
It was like
an elegant fairytale.

52:21.439 --> 52:23.372
And I thought we could bring
some of that here.

52:23.407 --> 52:25.141
Color themes
in blues and whites

52:25.176 --> 52:27.476

52:29.180 --> 52:31.981
- Edible silver bells.
- Yes.

52:32.016 --> 52:34.216
I saw your plans
for the changes, Chris

52:34.252 --> 52:37.086
and I must say,
I'm concerned.

52:37.121 --> 52:38.787
Where's the Snowman
Bounce House?

52:38.823 --> 52:40.456
And the Hot Cocoa Corner?

52:40.491 --> 52:42.091
'Santa's Village?'

52:42.126 --> 52:44.059
No more Santa's Village?

52:44.095 --> 52:45.928
[sighs]
Some things had to go

52:45.963 --> 52:47.963
to make room
for the new elements.

52:47.999 --> 52:51.300
Mr. Sumner, Tom made
a very generous donation

52:51.335 --> 52:53.102
but it was for a reason.

52:53.137 --> 52:56.305
So this year's Winter Wonderland
could take a step up.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.941
But we need to be practical
about it, too.

53:00.211 --> 53:01.377
It's practical.

53:08.186 --> 53:10.619
He never was very good
with changes.

53:10.655 --> 53:12.955
Uh, honey, I-I think
Mr. Sumner is concerned

53:12.990 --> 53:15.291
that this is
too sophisticated.

53:15.326 --> 53:18.961
We're still a small town.
People need things to do.

53:18.996 --> 53:21.130
Not just admire
the pretty lights.

53:24.035 --> 53:26.969
[instrumental music]

53:28.873 --> 53:31.674
So the gingerbread
should be dry by tonight.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.053
- So, I'll get to decorating.
- Hey.

53:33.077 --> 53:34.710
- You want some help with that?
- Uh, no.

53:34.745 --> 53:36.845
This is my domain. You'll just
have to be surprised.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.147
Oh, I like surprises.

53:39.350 --> 53:41.684
Kate. Greg.

53:41.719 --> 53:44.353
Um, Kate, so I just read

53:44.388 --> 53:46.155
'the email about
the Christmas party.'

53:46.190 --> 53:48.290
"Most Festive Holiday Sweater"

53:48.326 --> 53:50.793
and "Christmas Carol Karaoke?"

53:50.828 --> 53:53.896
I'm just concerned
that it's not really within

53:53.931 --> 53:55.831
Aldrin Development's style.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.132
My..
I've seen Kate's plans.

53:57.168 --> 53:58.734
And, yes, it will be different

53:58.769 --> 54:01.103
but, uh, I also think
it's gonna be a lot of fun.

54:02.106 --> 54:03.472
Okay.

54:03.507 --> 54:05.040
Well, then, we'll just see.

54:09.614 --> 54:12.214
Do you think I've made this
too small-town folksy?

54:12.250 --> 54:14.083
No, no, it's gonna be great.

54:14.118 --> 54:16.285
You have a the talent
for Christmas. Come on.

54:19.557 --> 54:21.657
No, I was just trying to do
something different.

54:23.027 --> 54:25.160
Me too.

54:25.196 --> 54:28.364
Are you eating my mint
chocolate chip ice cream?

54:28.399 --> 54:31.233
Yep. Mine's behind
the chicken stock.

54:35.373 --> 54:37.840
Oh.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.876
(Kate on speaker)
'So, do you think
dad and Sumner were wrong?'

54:40.911 --> 54:42.444
No.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.680
But, I mean,
I really like your ideas too.

54:44.715 --> 54:47.516
I think you can still
use those changes, just..

54:47.551 --> 54:49.429
Just bring back the stuff
for the families with kids

54:49.453 --> 54:50.919
so they're not bored.

54:50.955 --> 54:53.355
Fair enough,
I think there's still time.

54:53.391 --> 54:56.225
I can call in some favors
from my work contacts.

'Yeah, you're lucky
you have a backup plan'

54:57.762 --> 54:59.595
because if I make this party
too homey

54:59.630 --> 55:00.763
you're gonna be in trouble.

55:01.666 --> 55:03.399
Thanks.

55:03.434 --> 55:05.234
You know what I mean.

55:05.269 --> 55:08.370
I do.
And they'll like it.

55:08.406 --> 55:11.206
You always make
Christmas awesome.

56:01.125 --> 56:02.791
Team Winter Wonderland.

56:02.827 --> 56:04.993
What do you think?
Because Sumner's got me nervous.

56:06.330 --> 56:08.263
Oh, but I think
you've done a great job.

56:08.299 --> 56:10.666
Uh, especially with the
curveballs I've thrown at you.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.368
And I love
the blue and white theme.

56:12.403 --> 56:13.602
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

56:13.637 --> 56:15.537
Reminds me
of this ice hotel in Norway.

56:15.573 --> 56:18.974
Wha.. In Oslo?
Run by the Grundersens?

56:19.009 --> 56:21.110
- Mari and Jani?
- Yes.

56:21.145 --> 56:23.946
Yes, I went there two years ago.
I spent Christmas.

56:23.981 --> 56:25.514
- It was amazing!
- Come on!

56:29.987 --> 56:31.687
So did, did your kids love it?

56:33.657 --> 56:35.791
I went by myself.

56:35.826 --> 56:38.227
Yeah, uh, I do that, too,
sometimes.

56:38.262 --> 56:40.329
When Dylan's mom has him
for the holidays

56:40.364 --> 56:41.930
we, uh, rotate.

56:43.701 --> 56:46.702
- What do you and your ex do?
- Um..

56:46.737 --> 56:49.204
Oh.. Th-that was too forward.
I shouldn't have asked.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.173
No, no, it's, um..

56:57.348 --> 57:00.716
I think I finally got
all my shopping done, even for..

57:00.751 --> 57:02.751
Mom.

57:02.787 --> 57:04.553
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:06.056 --> 57:09.158
Well, I have got to go

57:09.193 --> 57:11.226
get some dinner on.

57:11.262 --> 57:13.395
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

57:19.236 --> 57:21.370
You should be proud
of what you've done so far.

57:21.405 --> 57:23.205
You're doin' great work.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.140
And I can't wait to see
what you do next year.

57:26.577 --> 57:27.709
Thank you.

57:30.948 --> 57:33.048
Sorry, Aunt Kate.
Bad timing.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.617
No, no,
it was good timing, actually.

57:35.653 --> 57:38.454
I needed to be reminded
that this is just pretend.

57:38.489 --> 57:40.355
But I mean,
you do like him, right?

57:40.391 --> 57:41.924
Mr. Kinder?

57:41.959 --> 57:43.692
It seems like you do.

57:43.727 --> 57:45.961
And he likes you too.
You can tell.

gonna stop the switch?

having you around.

How are you feeling
about what happened?

01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.598
Well, I'm upset.

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:06.668
And sad. I liked Greg a lot.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.938
It's been so long.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.707
And you know
what's good for that?

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.577
Hot cocoa.
Meet me behind Santa's village.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:20.582
[instrumental music]

01:10:28.525 --> 01:10:30.291
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.466
Is there anything
we haven't done?

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.801
I think the ice skating.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.769
Ice skating?
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

01:10:46.977 --> 01:10:48.087
Alright, you know,
when we switched

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:49.611
in Mrs. Paulson's trig class

01:10:49.646 --> 01:10:51.646
I don't remember it being
quite this complicated.

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.415
Yeah, except maybe
when mom found out.

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:57.585
- Yeah, that wasn't fun.
- Not at all.

01:10:57.621 --> 01:11:00.121
- I miss her.
- Me, too.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.958
Is that why you stopped
coming back here

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:05.760
because it reminds you of her?

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:09.097
I never really thought about it.

01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:10.665
Maybe, in part.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:13.868
Well, dad misses you.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.470
And the kids miss you.

01:11:16.206 --> 01:11:17.872
So do I.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.341
I miss you, too.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:22.277
It's been one of the best parts
about the switch

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.522
being able to talk to you more.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:24.879
Same.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:27.815
And how you saved
the Jasper Tower property.

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:31.219
Right? Yeah,
I was pretty proud of myself.

01:11:31.254 --> 01:11:34.322
Well, you should be.
You did a really great job.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:36.457
And I really appreciate it.

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:40.161
Thank you.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.998
You know, I admit it. I, I've
been really jealous of you.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:45.366
It's everything that you have.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:48.036
Your clothes, your career

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.138
your freedom. I..

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:53.274
- Me, I'm, I'm just...
- One of the best people I know.

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:56.878
Seriously, you don't get
how awesome you are.

01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:01.182
I've never worked so hard
than I have being Chris.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:03.718
And you do this
day in and day out.

01:12:03.753 --> 01:12:06.821
And it's not all your fault,
by the way, that we've drifted.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:09.657
I've been kinda jealous, too.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:12.226
Of what? My laundry?

01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:14.896
You have people to share
your life with. I don't.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.297
All I do is work.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.668
I've never really
even fallen in love.

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:23.838
What about Tom Kinder?

01:12:23.873 --> 01:12:26.908
- We were just kids.
- Well, you're not now. So..

01:12:29.612 --> 01:12:30.645
Oh..

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:34.716
I hear ya.

01:12:37.087 --> 01:12:39.520
[exhales sharply]
What a mess.

01:12:40.824 --> 01:12:44.425
- We'll figure it out.
- Yeah.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.261
In the meantime,
Tom is gonna ask you to dinner.

01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:50.365
- I promise I'll say no.
- Thank you.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.201
And things will be fine
with Greg.

01:12:54.304 --> 01:12:55.536
I can feel it.

01:12:59.476 --> 01:13:02.410
[instrumental music]

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:11.886
Mom?

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:12.921
- Yes?
- Yes?

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:14.589
Oh..

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:15.957
(Sumner)
'Kate Lockhart?'

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:17.825
- Yes?
- Yes?

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:20.461
Kate, so glad you could

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:22.897
finally make it back
to our carnival.

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:25.933
Principal Sumner,
it is so good to see you.

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:30.071
My sister was just telling me
about your idea

01:13:30.106 --> 01:13:33.441
of using the surplus of
Mr. Kinder's generous donation

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:37.111
to finally address the supply
needs of the teachers.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.913
I think it's a wonderful idea.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.982
Yes. Thank you,
Principal Sumner.

01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:44.752
And I think
it's a great idea, too.

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:46.854
The Art Department, especially

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.590
has really come through
with this carnival.

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:51.926
Yes. Of course.

01:13:51.961 --> 01:13:53.094
Very excited.

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:00.868
You must be Tom.

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.069
It's great to see you, Kate.

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:09.811
Oh. It's been a while
since I've seen my niece.

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:12.580
- So if you don't mind..
- I'll find you.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:16.951
Uh..

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:19.320
Tom, I..

01:14:19.355 --> 01:14:21.289
There's something
I have to tell you.

01:14:21.324 --> 01:14:23.024
- 'Chris.'
- Yes?

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.792
Greg. Whoa, ooh..
Mm..

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:25.960
- Greg!
- Chris.

01:14:25.995 --> 01:14:27.695
- Kate!
- Oh.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.497
- Who is he?
- Greg.

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.132
- Who's he?
- Tom.

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.768
Alright.
But, uh, who exactly are you?

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.340
I'm..

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:42.443
I'm Kate Lockhart.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.346
Nice to meet you.

01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:51.819
[chuckles]

01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:53.988
Tom, Tom, if you'll just...

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:55.023
Kate, wa-wait.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:57.158
[sighs]
Well..

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:59.760
- I-I-I have to...
- Kate, wait, just..

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.362
Can help me with Chris?

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:02.964
'Please.'

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:05.933
[instrumental music]

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.908
- Dad, did you see that?
- Yeah.

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:15.276
You're looking good.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.286
I'm glad you're back.

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:29.123
It's nice that we're all here.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:30.158
Not everyone.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:33.160
[dog whining]

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:34.562
[chuckles]

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:36.397
Hi.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:37.932
I came to see how you're doing.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:41.335
Now we're all together.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:43.437
Aunt Kate, are you gonna stay
for Christmas morning?

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:46.208
Definitely.

01:15:47.944 --> 01:15:50.811
Chris, Kate,
how do you feel about opening up

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.813
a couple
of Christmas presents now?

01:16:00.323 --> 01:16:01.489
Well, thanks.

01:16:03.493 --> 01:16:05.526
For both my girls.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:06.761
From your mom.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:11.599
Did you just find them?

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:15.469
Is this what made you think
of the Christmas Sister Brunch?

01:16:15.505 --> 01:16:17.149
I found them in the attic
when I was getting out

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:18.739
those Christmas decoration.

01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:23.210
You know how your mom
loved to hide presents.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:24.679
All over the house.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:27.114
All year long. Now, open them.

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:37.692
Your mother remembered how much
you both liked to skate together

01:16:37.727 --> 01:16:39.260
when you were younger.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.131
- Let's do more of that.
- Definitely.

01:16:50.673 --> 01:16:52.440
[doorbell rings]

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.485
Greg, what are you doing here?

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.387
Hello, Chris.

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:10.191
I hope you don't mind me coming
here. I just, I had to see you.

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.627
Oh. Well, how did you find me?

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:14.629
Oh, you've, uh, you mentioned
Winter Wonderland

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:15.930
so I started there.

01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:17.698
And then, uh, then Kate...

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.900
- Kate?
- 'Yeah, the real Kate.'

01:17:19.936 --> 01:17:22.403
She told me I'd find you here.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:23.904
- I see.
- 'Hm.'

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:28.809
This is more like it.

01:17:28.845 --> 01:17:32.680
I kept thinking the condo
was pretty, but... not you.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.018
Yeah. Well, this is the real me.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:39.620
The real me.

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:42.990
I like the real you.

01:17:43.026 --> 01:17:46.160
'I-I also liked the other you.'

01:17:46.195 --> 01:17:49.263
I guess I pretty much like you

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:50.631
'in all forms.'

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:54.435
And how else
can I explain it?

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.303
You know, I saw Kate every day
for three years

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:58.673
'and... nothing'

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:03.511
but I know the moment
that was you in her place.

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:05.913
You wore jeans
and you spilled those papers.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.419
[chuckles]
Greg, I'm..

01:18:11.454 --> 01:18:13.387
I'm a suburban single mom.

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:15.589
So?

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.626
Are you sure
you're okay with that?

01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:24.065
[sighs]
Only one way to find out.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.988
Everyone, this is Greg Turner.

01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:51.192
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.797
Gabriel Dixon. Son.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:19:00.000
It's nice to meet you, Gabriel.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:01.302
[Chris chuckles]

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.073
Thanks for having me.
I appreciate it.

01:19:06.109 --> 01:19:07.641
'Nice to meet you.'

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.015
[laughs]
So..

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:21.757
Where are you going?

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:22.823
I need to return

01:19:22.859 --> 01:19:24.258
to Winter Wonderland.

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.327
- I'll be back soon.
- You better.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:29.663
Oh, you are gonna get so sick
of seeing me.

01:19:29.699 --> 01:19:30.865
I can't wait.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.403
[indistinct chatter]

01:19:43.546 --> 01:19:45.880
Oh. Okay. Hi. Uh-huh.

01:19:46.983 --> 01:19:48.015
Whoa!

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.118
Gotcha.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.520
Tom.

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:55.222
Hello... Kate.

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.764
Sorry about walking away
like that earlier.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.867
Oh. You should not be
the one apologizing.

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:10.237
I-I-I can't believe
you still wanna talk to me.

01:20:10.273 --> 01:20:13.207
I always knew there was more
to the story, then and now.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.644
When we were younger,
my sister and I

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:19.647
we used to switch places,
just for fun.

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:23.083
And the last time we did
was the day that you and I met

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:24.618
but I had someplace to be

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:28.289
but I-I really wanted
to be with you.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:31.659
And now, this whole time?

01:20:31.694 --> 01:20:33.093
Was me.

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:34.461
Chris and I
first started to do it

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:36.564
just to see
how the other one lived.

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:40.901
- But then you came along.
- And?

01:20:41.938 --> 01:20:44.338
I didn't wanna go back.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.607
I wanted to be with you.

01:20:52.849 --> 01:20:54.615
Alright,
I give you fair warning.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:57.952
This might sound a little..

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:01.322
You ever meet someone..

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.257
...who just makes you
feel at home?

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:06.393
Once.

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:09.630
On two occasions.

01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:14.535
[gasps]
Just to be clear

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.837
I'm Kate Lockhart.

01:21:16.873 --> 01:21:18.539
I'm single, I have no children.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:20.307
I work
in real estate development

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:22.943
and I live in Denver.

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:25.813
Any chance I can convince you
to come up to Littleton

01:21:25.848 --> 01:21:27.715
a little more often?

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.483
Hm..

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:31.051
There's a really good chance.

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:34.154
Well, Denver's not so far,
anyways.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:37.358
[chuckles]
I heard the road
goes both directions.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.393
We will have to test that theory

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:40.728
but not tonight.

01:21:40.763 --> 01:21:42.263
I have another plan.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.566
And what would that be?

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.368
Unfinished business.

01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:54.775
