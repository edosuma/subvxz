00:16.004 --> 00:18.005
A reading from the Holy Gospel.

00:18.645 --> 00:19.645
Which one's ours?

00:19.725 --> 00:22.125
She didn't send a photo.

00:22.205 --> 00:24.885
Her family probably
don't even own a camera.

00:24.965 --> 00:27.365
She'll find Derry
a bit overwhelming at first,

00:27.445 --> 00:29.725
just because of how advanced
everything is here.

00:29.805 --> 00:31.645
All the cracker stuff we have.

00:31.725 --> 00:35.685
They have some pretty cracker
stuff where she comes from, too, Erin.

00:35.765 --> 00:37.325
Oh, really? Like what?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.645
Disease? Poverty?

00:39.725 --> 00:41.005
No.

00:41.085 --> 00:43.805
You can get this wee woman
made of wood, right?

00:43.885 --> 00:48.365
You pull her apart and inside her
there's an even weer wooden woman,

00:48.445 --> 00:50.125
and you pull
the weer wooden woman apart...

00:50.165 --> 00:52.285
Are you talking about Russian dolls?

00:56.285 --> 00:57.485
What are you doing?

00:57.565 --> 00:58.845
Taking my change.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.685
Sarah, you don't get change.

01:00.765 --> 01:04.165
I telt you, Gerry.
I'm gonna give them a whole fiver?

01:04.245 --> 01:06.445
That's definitely happening.

01:09.005 --> 01:10.245
Did you just wink?

01:10.845 --> 01:12.045
No.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.165
You did.

01:13.245 --> 01:14.645
You just winked.

01:14.725 --> 01:18.085
Sure, winking's not in my notion, Mary.
What would I have to be winking about?

01:18.165 --> 01:21.005
I don't know. I'll find out.

01:21.085 --> 01:23.685
This is
the word of the Lord.

01:26.005 --> 01:29.525
And today we welcome
some very special guests:

01:29.605 --> 01:30.845
the wains from Chernobyl,

01:30.925 --> 01:34.845
who've come over to give
their wee lungs a bit of a clear out,

01:34.925 --> 01:39.885
because, ah, sure, there's all sorts
wafting about in their neck of the woods.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.285
Sister.

01:41.365 --> 01:44.125
Lovely job so far, Seamus,
but, you know, keep it moving.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.725
<i>Rawhide's </i> on in 15 minutes.

01:45.805 --> 01:51.565
Now, one might well question the wisdom
of sending you here, of all places.

01:52.005 --> 01:54.005
Out of the frying pan into the...

01:54.085 --> 01:57.685
well, maybe not the fire, but certainly
a different type of frying pan.

01:57.765 --> 02:00.605
Or some sort of wok at the very least.

02:01.365 --> 02:06.045
But please, don't worry yourselves
too much about the whole civil war,

02:06.125 --> 02:08.405
sectarian conflict carry on.

02:08.485 --> 02:10.324
There's really only one thing
you need to know.

02:11.325 --> 02:12.605
We're the goodies.

02:13.725 --> 02:14.765
Welcome to Derry.

02:35.725 --> 02:37.165
It's class, isn't it?

02:37.245 --> 02:39.725
Hmm. It's much how I imagine.

02:39.805 --> 02:41.645
Oh, because of my letters?

02:41.725 --> 02:44.565
Well, descriptive narrative
has always been a strong point.

02:44.645 --> 02:47.045
No, not your letters.
I see on news.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.925
What do you mean,
you've seen on news?

02:49.005 --> 02:51.685
You don't have news in the Ukraine.
You don't have televisions.

02:51.765 --> 02:54.285
- Yes, we do. We do.
- No, you don't. Really?

02:54.365 --> 02:55.565
Of course.

02:55.645 --> 02:57.325
Erin, stop hogging the Russian.

02:57.405 --> 02:59.085
Yeah, come on, Erin.
Give Orla a go.

02:59.165 --> 03:00.965
She's Ukrainian, actually.

03:01.045 --> 03:04.285
Yeah, go on, love.
Say something to Katya.

03:04.365 --> 03:07.565
Your name sounds a bit like "cat".

03:07.645 --> 03:08.965
God, aye, so it does.

03:09.045 --> 03:10.925
You don't know a Jack McGinley, do you?

03:11.005 --> 03:13.885
Moved to Moscow, '88, '89,
it would have been.

03:13.965 --> 03:15.405
- Seriously?
- No.

03:15.485 --> 03:17.045
- Stocky fella.
- No.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.285
- Curly hair, bit of a lisp.
- I do not know this person.

03:20.365 --> 03:22.005
Ah, maybe just as well, love.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.485
He's an awful prick.

03:31.525 --> 03:34.285
So, Katya, I've done
a bit of an itinerary for your stay.

03:34.365 --> 03:36.405
You should have received a copy
in my last letter.

03:36.485 --> 03:37.925
I don't read your letters, Erin.

03:38.005 --> 03:39.925
I'm sorry?
I don't follow.

03:40.005 --> 03:41.725
Your letters, they bore.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.525
- They're "boring".
- Exactly.

03:43.605 --> 03:45.341
- That's not what I...
- I can smoke here, yes?

03:45.365 --> 03:47.765
No. No, you can't.

03:47.845 --> 03:49.085
Mammy's like a bloodhound.

03:50.085 --> 03:52.461
Your ma said we could come up
and have a look at the Russian.

03:52.485 --> 03:54.845
- Ukrainian.
- Is this her?

03:54.925 --> 03:56.965
Isn't she cracker?
She's half mine.

03:57.045 --> 03:59.805
- No, she's not, Orla.
- Aye, she is. Mammy said so.

03:59.885 --> 04:01.125
You're so lucky, Erin.

04:01.205 --> 04:03.685
I begged my ma to let me have one,
but she said we've no room

04:03.765 --> 04:06.725
now that my dickhead, ballbag,
English prick of a cousin's moved in.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.805
Talking about you, James,
in case you're wondering.

04:08.845 --> 04:10.725
Yeah, that much was clear,
thank you, Michelle.

04:10.805 --> 04:12.965
Have you seen the one
Jenny Joyce got, the fella?

04:13.045 --> 04:14.885
Massive, massive ride.

04:14.965 --> 04:18.485
I've been thinking. Maybe time for me
to lose the rest of my virginity.

04:18.565 --> 04:20.565
He's definitely a contender.

04:21.045 --> 04:22.725
You help me.

04:22.805 --> 04:28.045
You put in good word
with your Cossack friend.

04:28.125 --> 04:29.805
So we can...

04:29.885 --> 04:31.285
Would you stop that?

04:32.045 --> 04:32.965
I'm very sorry
for all your trouble, you know,

04:33.045 --> 04:34.805
the whole hoo-ha at the power plant.

04:34.885 --> 04:36.245
Okay.

04:37.005 --> 04:39.445
When you think about it,
we've actually got a lot in common,

04:39.525 --> 04:42.925
'cause we understand what it's like to be
a young person from a troubled place,

04:43.005 --> 04:44.205
It is not the same.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.885
Chernobyl was terrible nuclear accident.

04:47.965 --> 04:50.245
You people like to fight each other
and, to be honest,

04:50.325 --> 04:52.565
no person really understands why.

04:52.645 --> 04:56.085
Well, there's actually
a political element to it, Katya,

04:56.165 --> 04:57.485
and there's a religious element.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.461
Mmm, but you're not
two different religions here.

04:59.485 --> 05:01.845
You're different flavors
of same religion, no?

05:02.965 --> 05:05.765
Well, yes, but...

05:05.845 --> 05:08.525
it's a little bit more complicated
than that, Katya.

05:08.605 --> 05:09.765
To me, is stupid.

05:09.845 --> 05:11.205
Oh, my God.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.125
It is stupid.

05:15.005 --> 05:17.085
It is so, so stupid.

05:17.165 --> 05:18.565
Who is this?

05:18.645 --> 05:19.845
Oh, that's just James.

05:19.925 --> 05:21.725
You are handsome.

05:21.805 --> 05:23.085
And also sexy.

05:24.205 --> 05:25.245
Is her English not great?

05:31.445 --> 05:33.845
What's happening?

05:33.925 --> 05:35.485
Why would she do that?

05:35.565 --> 05:37.445
- Why?
- Fuck knows. He's minging.

05:37.525 --> 05:40.045
She seems to be really
enjoying it.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.085
- Is he enjoying it?
- It's hard to tell.

05:42.165 --> 05:46.885
Well, if he's not enjoying it,
isn't that sort of sexual harassment?

05:46.965 --> 05:48.605
Yeah, we should put a stop to it.

05:48.685 --> 05:52.005
- Aye.
- Does anyone want a Fruit Pastille?

05:56.685 --> 06:00.325
And when Erin finished
reading me her poetry,

06:00.405 --> 06:02.565
she showed me some old walls.

06:02.645 --> 06:04.085
I showed you "the walls".

06:04.165 --> 06:08.245
I showed you the city walls,
and they are nothing short of spectacular.

06:08.325 --> 06:12.325
Ach, if she's not into walls,
she's not into walls, Erin, love.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.885
Have you any news, Da?

06:13.965 --> 06:15.205
Not really, no.

06:15.285 --> 06:17.885
Right. Shay Harkin was telling me

06:17.965 --> 06:20.605
you were in Duggan's bakery
yesterday lunchtime.

06:21.365 --> 06:22.765
That's hardly news.

06:22.845 --> 06:26.405
- Two buns he says you ordered.
- I often do.

06:26.485 --> 06:29.605
An apple turnover and a cream horn.

06:29.685 --> 06:31.045
A cream horn?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.285
That's not like you, Granda.

06:33.365 --> 06:35.485
Sure, you couldn't pay you
to eat a cream horn.

06:35.565 --> 06:38.205
Cream finger, it was.
Apple turnover and a cream finger.

06:38.285 --> 06:39.685
Cream horn, Shay said.

06:39.765 --> 06:41.125
Horns, fingers. Who cares?

06:41.205 --> 06:43.165
He swore on it.
Said he saw it being bagged up.

06:43.245 --> 06:45.205
Big Shay has eyes like a hawk, so he does.

06:45.285 --> 06:48.565
Shay said when you left Duggan's
you turned up Pump Street.

06:48.645 --> 06:50.125
Pump Street?

06:50.205 --> 06:52.205
Who do you know on Pump Street, Da?

06:52.285 --> 06:56.085
What were you doing heading up
Pump Street with a cream horn, Da?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.085
- I was visiting a friend of mine.
- What friend?

06:58.125 --> 07:00.245
- A new friend.
- A male friend, was it?

07:02.325 --> 07:04.645
Aye, I thought as much.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.925
Buying cream horns for his fancy woman.

07:07.005 --> 07:08.405
Sarah, what do you think of that?

07:08.485 --> 07:10.165
We met at the Stations of the Cross.

07:10.245 --> 07:12.965
- What station?
- Jesus falls for the second time.

07:13.045 --> 07:14.765
I could do without the details, Da.

07:14.845 --> 07:15.845
Maeve and me, we...

07:16.845 --> 07:18.101
We just get on well, that's all.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.685
- Maeve? That's her name, is it?
- Yes, that's right.

07:20.765 --> 07:22.581
Maeve.
That's what she's called, is she?

07:22.605 --> 07:25.485
- She is, aye.
- Maeve. Maeve. Really?

07:25.565 --> 07:27.845
- Maeve?
- Why does your mother make that sound?

07:27.925 --> 07:29.861
- I cannot believe this.
- I think it's a good thing, love.

07:29.885 --> 07:31.245
Just keep out of it, you.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.725
And that's who you
were winking at in mass?

07:33.805 --> 07:37.125
- Winking? At your age?
- Mm-hmm.

07:37.205 --> 07:39.285
Christ, I feel sick.

07:39.365 --> 07:41.365
It was only a friendly wink.

07:41.445 --> 07:43.485
There is no such thing as a
friendly wink.

07:43.565 --> 07:47.685
- Is there not?
- Our poor mother is barely cold,

07:47.765 --> 07:50.765
and you're straight back out there,
winking away.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.525
Your mother's been dead ten years, Mary.

07:52.605 --> 07:53.845
Look, I'll not tell you again.

07:53.925 --> 07:55.365
I'm sorry.

07:56.045 --> 07:58.205
I seem to have lost my appetite.

08:01.485 --> 08:04.005
You happy now?

08:04.085 --> 08:06.285
<i>♪ Young at heart ♪</i>

08:10.765 --> 08:12.685
I don't know.
I just find her a bit,

08:12.765 --> 08:14.725
"I have a fringe and cigarettes
and opinions",

08:14.805 --> 08:17.605
and she's also a bit, you know,
"I hate walls", and she's just not...

08:17.685 --> 08:19.685
Oh, the grateful, little,
peasant girl you ordered?

08:19.725 --> 08:20.805
Yeah... No.

08:21.525 --> 08:23.605
I just don't trust her, okay?

08:23.685 --> 08:26.765
And that thing she said
about my letters being boring,

08:26.845 --> 08:30.365
I really think she's playing some sort of
twisted psychological mind game here.

08:30.445 --> 08:32.205
Or maybe your letters
are just fucking dull.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.085
My letters are a gripping read.

08:34.164 --> 08:36.461
I'm not comfortable with you talking
about my girlfriend like this.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.804
Ah-ha! And she also fancies James.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.365
You don't find that a bit weird?

08:40.445 --> 08:42.284
Aye, that is a bit fucked up, in fairness.

08:42.365 --> 08:43.725
I can't get my head around it.

08:43.804 --> 08:45.725
I'm telling you, she's up to something.

08:45.805 --> 08:48.565
Even so, I need her to put a word in
with that big Russian ride.

08:48.645 --> 08:51.165
And I really like the fact
she glows in the dark.

08:51.245 --> 08:53.845
- I'm sorry?
- Because of the radiation,

08:53.925 --> 08:56.605
- they all glow in the dark.
- Right.

08:56.685 --> 09:00.285
She's also opened my eyes about
how we need to break down barriers here,

09:00.365 --> 09:04.325
to no longer define ourselves as Irish
or British, Catholic or Protestant,

09:04.405 --> 09:08.205
but simply as human,
with human hearts and human heads

09:08.285 --> 09:11.605
and human hands
and other human qualities,

09:11.685 --> 09:14.845
because at the end of the day,
we're all... humans.

09:17.205 --> 09:18.445
Hi.

09:21.045 --> 09:23.445
Incoming ride.
I repeat, incoming ride.

09:23.525 --> 09:26.165
Hi, everyone. This is Artem.

09:26.245 --> 09:28.085
Well, hello, Artem.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.325
Go on, then.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.845
She wants to have sex with you.

09:38.325 --> 09:39.845
He doesn't say much.

09:40.485 --> 09:42.605
Is he... is he tied to you?

09:42.685 --> 09:44.125
Yeah, he kept wandering off.

09:44.765 --> 09:48.645
Listen, I've a feeling Artem and
a few of the others are a bit homesick.

09:48.725 --> 09:51.045
It'd be nice for them
to spend some time together.

09:51.125 --> 09:55.685
So I'm having a bit of a soiree at
my place tonight. It's going to be great.

09:55.765 --> 09:57.525
I've got a chocolate
fountain and everything!

09:58.205 --> 10:00.285
Well, chocolate fountain or not,

10:00.365 --> 10:03.245
I'd actually prefer to keep
our Ukrainians separate, so...

10:05.445 --> 10:07.725
Oh, Christ. David.

10:07.805 --> 10:09.805
David Donnelly has just come in.
David's here.

10:09.885 --> 10:12.765
Right. Okay. Don't look.
Nobody look.

10:14.165 --> 10:16.165
Hi, do you have a playlist
for tonight, then?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.565
I'll need the sound system set
up by 7:00.

10:18.645 --> 10:21.005
Is your band playing
at this thing tonight?

10:21.085 --> 10:23.485
Oh, no. Christ, no,
I just do a bit of DJing at the side.

10:23.565 --> 10:24.765
Make a bit of extra cash.

10:24.845 --> 10:26.645
Wacca-wacca, cha-ching!

10:26.725 --> 10:29.605
Oh, my band, we don't really do covers.
Do you know what I mean?

10:29.685 --> 10:31.485
In this game,
you need a wee bit of integrity.

10:31.525 --> 10:33.725
Now, whatever you do,
don't forget the Grease mega mix.

10:35.005 --> 10:36.005
Yep.

10:39.325 --> 10:44.405
Actually, on second thoughts, I think this
party would be really great for Katya.

10:44.485 --> 10:47.125
Might help bring her
out of her shell a bit.

10:49.325 --> 10:51.525
<i>♪ Spinderella cut it up one time ♪</i>

10:52.445 --> 10:55.445
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, hey ♪</i>

10:59.045 --> 11:00.245
Oh, you look very...

11:02.045 --> 11:03.285
boob-y.

11:03.365 --> 11:05.325
Yes, I like.

11:05.405 --> 11:06.765
We go now?

11:09.845 --> 11:10.925
Katya.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.085
Well, well, well.

11:40.485 --> 11:42.885
<i>♪ She leads a lonely life ♪</i>

11:42.965 --> 11:44.645
Size of this motherfucking house!

11:44.725 --> 11:46.605
Listen, I think James
might be in real trouble.

11:46.685 --> 11:49.125
Right. Struggling to give a shit,
if I'm honest.

11:49.205 --> 11:51.885
- Where is Katya?
- I don't know. Why?

11:51.965 --> 11:53.485
I must... I must give.

11:56.805 --> 11:58.125
Hi, girls.

11:58.205 --> 12:01.045
Have you got a Union Jack
splashed across your tits, Clare?

12:01.125 --> 12:02.205
I'm making a point.

12:02.285 --> 12:03.621
Is the point, "I'd like to get beaten up"?

12:03.645 --> 12:05.485
Me wearing this, it should be meaningless.

12:05.565 --> 12:07.525
These are just colors and shapes.

12:07.605 --> 12:09.285
This flag is not an identity.

12:09.365 --> 12:11.445
We need to take the power
out of these symbols.

12:11.525 --> 12:14.565
Genuine question.
Why can't you just be fucking normal?

12:17.205 --> 12:19.485
- Enjoy the chocolate fountain, Orla?
- Very much so.

12:19.565 --> 12:21.285
Focus, girls.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.885
Has anyone seen Artem?

12:22.965 --> 12:25.485
I untied him for his toilet privileges
half an hour ago

12:25.565 --> 12:27.365
- and now I can't find him.
- What?

12:27.445 --> 12:29.485
Listen, I know this might be
a bit shocking,

12:29.565 --> 12:32.805
but I think Katya is planning
on taking James' virginity tonight.

12:32.885 --> 12:35.605
I found condoms in her bag,
actual condoms.

12:35.685 --> 12:37.381
Like, I don't even think
they're legal in Derry.

12:37.405 --> 12:39.365
- Wise up, Erin.
- We have to stop her.

12:40.525 --> 12:41.645
- Yes!
- Yes!

12:41.725 --> 12:45.445
- Tune!
- It's our song, girls. It's our song!

12:45.525 --> 12:47.405
- I've lost Katya.
- Good.

12:47.845 --> 12:49.085
Let's hit the floor, girls!

12:51.485 --> 12:53.445
She doesn't love him.
She's just using him.

12:53.525 --> 12:54.885
She just wants something to do.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.605
But she can't do James.
He's not a pastime or a plaything.

13:01.005 --> 13:04.525
Ach, Erin, if she wants to ride James,
just let her ride James.

13:04.605 --> 13:07.005
Nobody else is ever gonna wanna touch
the poor fucker.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.205
I mean, maybe it's just his time.

13:11.285 --> 13:13.125
I mean, we're all gonna
have sex at some point.

13:13.165 --> 13:14.205
You probably won't, Clare.

13:14.245 --> 13:16.245
Aye, I can't see that, either,
to be honest, Clare.

13:18.805 --> 13:19.845
There you are.

13:21.045 --> 13:23.045
Oh, playing hard to get, are we, Artem?

13:24.405 --> 13:27.045
Or he could be, you know,
just not interested.

13:27.445 --> 13:28.685
Fuck off, toots.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.565
Shit. James.

13:33.765 --> 13:36.005
How could he bring
another woman into this house?

13:37.725 --> 13:39.645
How could he bring her here,

13:39.725 --> 13:41.685
into our mother's home?

13:41.765 --> 13:44.765
- Your mother never lived in this house.
- Shut up, Gerry.

13:44.845 --> 13:46.485
Right. Come on in there, Maeve.

13:47.685 --> 13:49.765
Now, these are my daughters.

13:49.845 --> 13:51.925
That's Mary, and this is Sarah.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.285
Hello, Maeve.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.645
Maeve.

13:55.805 --> 13:57.485
I'm Mary's husband, Gerry.

13:57.565 --> 14:00.685
We're Mary and Gerry
and we're living in Derry.

14:03.405 --> 14:05.565
I'll get the tea going.

14:08.205 --> 14:10.845
Right, I'll just grab my beads.
Be back in a minute.

14:10.925 --> 14:12.405
Just make yourself comfortable.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.005
You'll not have to ask Maeve twice.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.005
Sorry, love, did you say something?

14:16.085 --> 14:18.445
Gerry's name is on the house, not my da's,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.085
if that's what you were thinking.

14:20.165 --> 14:21.645
If what's what I'm thinking?

14:21.725 --> 14:24.965
Hobnob? Custard cream? Wagon Wheel?

14:25.045 --> 14:27.885
What age are you, Maeve, like, 30?

14:27.965 --> 14:30.525
- I'm 62.
- Sugar daddy you're after, is it?

14:31.325 --> 14:33.565
I just wanna let you know, Maeve,

14:33.645 --> 14:35.685
we'll never call you "mammy".

14:37.125 --> 14:39.285
- Okay.
- And I just wanna say,

14:39.365 --> 14:42.965
although I'm not happy
about this thing with me da,

14:43.045 --> 14:46.325
I have to give it to you,
that is a cracker blow-dry.

14:46.405 --> 14:49.485
Great volume. Lovely movement.

15:02.365 --> 15:04.765
Come on, Artem.
You want me and I want you.

15:04.845 --> 15:06.245
Let's stop playing these games.

15:06.325 --> 15:07.925
Look, I don't want any trouble.

15:08.005 --> 15:10.925
I'm begging you,
just leave me alone, please.

15:11.685 --> 15:13.005
Why are you suddenly Irish?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.445
Queue to the right-hand side, please.

15:22.525 --> 15:25.325
One Chupa Chup per person.

15:25.405 --> 15:28.845
James. Listen, I have something
to tell you, and...

15:28.925 --> 15:31.085
Ooh, Dib-Dab. Okay.

15:31.165 --> 15:32.605
I'm just gonna say it.

15:32.685 --> 15:35.765
I think Katya is planning
on having sex with you, tonight.

15:35.845 --> 15:37.405
- I know.
- You know?

15:37.485 --> 15:39.005
I'm meeting her upstairs in a bit.

15:39.085 --> 15:40.925
She told me to have some food first.

15:41.005 --> 15:43.965
Apparently, sex uses up a lot of energy.

15:44.045 --> 15:46.365
- You do not want to do this, James.
- Yes, I do.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.525
- You're not ready for it.
- I am.

15:48.605 --> 15:51.245
She doesn't love you, James.
She's just using you.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.125
Yeah, but the thing is, I don't care.

15:54.845 --> 15:56.805
I won't let you.
I won't let you do it.

15:56.885 --> 15:58.165
You can't stop me.

15:58.245 --> 16:00.525
Fine. In that case,
I'll just come and watch.

16:00.805 --> 16:02.605
- What?
- You heard me, James.

16:02.685 --> 16:04.485
If you insist on going through with this,

16:04.565 --> 16:06.805
well, I'm... I'm gonna make sure
you don't enjoy it.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.565
I'm skiving. Say nothing.

16:10.485 --> 16:12.285
Oh, Jenny is a bit of
a head mother isn't she?

16:12.365 --> 16:13.445
What?

16:13.525 --> 16:15.925
Oh, yeah. Big time.

16:16.005 --> 16:18.085
I've got some beers,
if you fancy a sneaky one.

16:18.165 --> 16:20.125
Just give me one minute.

16:20.205 --> 16:21.805
I just have to... I'll be right back.

16:21.885 --> 16:25.325
Just stay here. One minute.

16:27.365 --> 16:28.685
- Where's Katya?
- I don't know.

16:28.765 --> 16:30.805
Up there somewhere,
trying to mount my friend.

16:31.405 --> 16:32.405
I owe.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.045
And the plot thickens.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.925
Can you believe him?

16:38.005 --> 16:40.525
Flaunting it in our faces like this.

16:40.605 --> 16:43.085
I don't even know the man anymore.

16:43.165 --> 16:47.165
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

16:47.245 --> 16:48.885
- Amen.
- Unbelievable.

16:48.965 --> 16:50.165
Jammy Dodger?

16:50.245 --> 16:53.885
Blessed art thou and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

17:00.405 --> 17:01.725
James?

17:05.204 --> 17:06.204
James?

17:07.085 --> 17:09.045
Is there any need
for the size of this place?

17:09.724 --> 17:11.565
- James?
- All right?

17:11.645 --> 17:14.204
- What is going on?
- Trying to sort Clive out.

17:14.285 --> 17:17.325
- Clive? Who's Clive?
- Christ.

17:17.405 --> 17:19.165
You dirty, dirty Brit.

17:19.244 --> 17:21.484
- I beg your pardon?
- I know what you're up to.

17:21.565 --> 17:24.325
I'm not up to anything.
I should be up to something,

17:24.405 --> 17:27.125
but I can't find the person
I'm supposed to be up to it with,

17:27.204 --> 17:29.045
because this place
is like a fucking maze.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.325
Shh!

17:30.405 --> 17:32.405
- You'll scare Clive.
- Who's Clive?

17:32.485 --> 17:33.845
Clive.

17:33.925 --> 17:36.045
Clive is a wee Prod from east
Belfast.

17:36.125 --> 17:39.165
Clive came back from Ibiza, got on
the wrong bus at Aldergrove Airport,

17:39.245 --> 17:40.685
then fell asleep.

17:40.765 --> 17:43.645
Clive woke up in Derry,
surrounded by Russians and Fenians.

17:43.725 --> 17:45.485
Clive is absolutely shitting himself.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.925
So where's the real Artem?

17:47.005 --> 17:48.685
Giant's Causeway, probably.

17:48.765 --> 17:51.045
Foreigners fucking love
the Giant's Causeway.

17:51.125 --> 17:54.205
I just wanna go home,
but she won't let me leave.

17:54.285 --> 17:56.485
She won't let me leave.

17:56.565 --> 18:00.485
Um, I also think Clive may have had
too many disco biscuits on his holidays.

18:01.765 --> 18:03.285
Here you are.

18:03.365 --> 18:05.685
Thank God.

18:06.765 --> 18:09.205
Whatever you do, don't slag off the Pope.

18:10.285 --> 18:11.365
We're outnumbered.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.805
For God's sake, Orla,
you're gonna make yourself boke.

18:16.525 --> 18:17.885
I can handle it.

18:19.325 --> 18:21.925
James, what is going on?
I wait long time.

18:22.005 --> 18:23.845
You no longer want to do sex?

18:23.925 --> 18:26.645
No, no, no, I do want to do sex.
I really, really want to do sex.

18:26.725 --> 18:29.805
- Come.
- You disgust me.

18:30.885 --> 18:33.525
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Piss off, Erin.

18:33.605 --> 18:35.965
I mean, I know you're desperate, James,
but paying for it?

18:36.045 --> 18:37.205
What?

18:37.285 --> 18:38.965
You really thought I wouldn't work it out?

18:39.045 --> 18:40.845
Work what out?

18:40.925 --> 18:43.805
What the actual cock
are you talking about?

18:43.885 --> 18:45.885
I'm talking about the fact
that she's a prostitute.

18:48.365 --> 18:51.205
I am prostitute?

18:51.285 --> 18:55.005
Oh, come off it, James.
She's charging you for it, isn't she?

18:55.085 --> 18:59.125
- Just admit it.
- No. I mean, I don't think so.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.725
- I mean, not that I wouldn't consider it.
- Ugh!

19:01.805 --> 19:06.725
How dare you? I am poor Ukrainian,
so I must be prostitute.

19:07.805 --> 19:08.885
Hear me out.

19:09.885 --> 19:12.165
First, she comes on to James
here.

19:12.245 --> 19:14.205
What would possess her?

19:14.285 --> 19:16.125
Financial gain, that's what.

19:16.205 --> 19:18.925
- He attractive boy, Erin.
- He's English, Katya.

19:19.005 --> 19:21.325
- I have no problem with this.
- You should.

19:21.405 --> 19:23.965
Secondly, she owns condoms.

19:24.045 --> 19:26.685
They're in her bag. A whole packet.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.005
And I've seen them, people.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.725
- You are imbecile.
- "An" imbecile.

19:29.805 --> 19:33.725
And thirdly, all night,
wee Ukrainian fellas

19:33.805 --> 19:36.965
have been coming up
and giving her money they "owe" her.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.765
How the hell do you explain that?

19:40.685 --> 19:43.925
I organize, how you say it, whip round.

19:44.525 --> 19:47.845
We like to buy Jenny present
to thank her for nice party.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.365
Oh, you guys.

19:51.205 --> 19:52.725
Right. Okay.

19:53.405 --> 19:54.965
Yeah, that does sort of explain it.

19:55.045 --> 19:56.645
- Dickhead.
- Really, Erin.

19:56.885 --> 20:00.285
So not only you insult me,
but you've also spoiled Jenny's surprise.

20:03.445 --> 20:05.285
I think you should leave.

20:08.205 --> 20:10.245
Yeah.

20:10.325 --> 20:14.645
But great evening all the same, Jenny.
You're a credit to yourself.

20:25.245 --> 20:27.565
Come on, Katya, love.
Let's talk about this, please.

20:27.645 --> 20:29.085
I am finished talking.

20:29.165 --> 20:31.525
She is racist, patronizing bitch.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.125
I am "a" racist, patronizing bitch.

20:34.205 --> 20:36.125
Now, come on, girls. Language, please.

20:36.205 --> 20:39.405
Well, you don't really wanna go
to Jenny Joyce's house, do you, love?

20:39.485 --> 20:40.805
Yes, I do.

20:41.605 --> 20:44.365
Apart from anything, it has eight bedrooms
and a chocolate fountain.

20:44.445 --> 20:46.365
I hope you're happy, Erin.

20:46.925 --> 20:49.085
- You've just done us out of your Russian.
- Ukrainian.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.525
Good for you, Mr. Joe.

20:51.605 --> 20:54.805
She is hot and you're not dead, yet.

20:54.885 --> 20:56.205
Why not have some fun?

21:06.285 --> 21:10.405
Tell me this. Does Jenny Joyce's house
really have eight bedrooms?

21:10.485 --> 21:13.165
Aye. And some of the bedrooms,

21:13.245 --> 21:17.005
they have these wee, tiny bathrooms
attached to them.

21:17.085 --> 21:18.645
Imagine.

21:23.125 --> 21:26.365
Your girls, they're just not ready, Joe.

21:27.325 --> 21:29.245
Maybe see you in mass, then, eh?

21:29.325 --> 21:30.605
Aye.

21:32.685 --> 21:34.445
Here, give me your hand.

21:36.005 --> 21:39.845
Tell Sarah this is the fella
that blow-dries my hair.

21:40.765 --> 21:42.165
He's an artist.

21:45.445 --> 21:46.645
Take care.

21:51.765 --> 21:54.845
- That Maeve away?
- Aye.

21:55.445 --> 21:58.045
