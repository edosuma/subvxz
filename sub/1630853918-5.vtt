00:03.838 --> 00:06.298
Rooster told me
you guys had a thing in prison.

00:06.382 --> 00:09.176
Well, we just used to talk to each other
through the toilet.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.053
And turns out,
he was lying to me the whole time.

00:11.137 --> 00:14.724
I gotta say, I thought you were crazy,
but you were right.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.183
-Mm.
-It feels good.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.936
Yeah. Sure does.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.521
What's your name?

00:20.604 --> 00:21.814
Rooster.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.024
Rooster. Exotic.

Don't be puttin' no toenails in there,
tryin' to get a free dog again.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.320
Nah, it's an engagement ring.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.114
You need to make a choice.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.658
Do you want a mother
or whatever this trash calls herself?

00:32.742 --> 00:33.617
I'm sorry.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.162
[Wiggles] You made your choice
and you chose Mommy.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.164
I love you, Wiggles Rosenstein.

That's a Claude van Woodson.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.711
It's probably worth half a million dollars
if we can get our hands on it.

00:43.794 --> 00:48.549
What do you say, Jack? Crooked politician
lying to the people while she cashes in?

00:48.632 --> 00:49.592
Bad enough for ya?

00:49.675 --> 00:51.761
See these security cameras
inside her house?

00:51.844 --> 00:55.306
We tap into her Wi-Fi and we get
24-hour surveillance inside her home.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.018
And the house can air out all weekend
while no one's here. I'm done!

00:59.101 --> 01:00.853
They're goin' away for the weekend.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.813
We're gonna be rich!

When do you think he'll be here?

01:29.089 --> 01:29.924
Soon, I hope.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.884
You were right, though.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.385
A few days ago when you said

01:33.469 --> 01:35.971
you were worried about someone
screwin' this whole thing up.

01:36.055 --> 01:39.683
Well, we still have time.
There's no reason to panic.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.602
Clock is tickin' on this thing, though.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.021
I mean, figuratively.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.940
It doesn't tick at all, does it?

[mocking] Would you like to be accompanied
when you go to the phone store?

02:05.793 --> 02:06.627
[chuckles]

02:06.710 --> 02:09.088
Sure, I'll be down in a sec.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.057
Whoa. Are you makin' a bomb?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.600
It's a fizzy water machine.

02:21.684 --> 02:25.688
I'll make you one, but be warned,
I prefer my carbonation sharp.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.690
Like the devil dancin' on my tongue.

02:27.773 --> 02:28.858
Well, maybe later.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.693
Gloria and I are gonna
walk to the phone store.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.778
If we're gonna hit
the Congresswoman's house Saturday,

02:32.862 --> 02:34.572
we're all gonna need
to be able to communicate.

02:34.655 --> 02:37.408
So it takes two people
to go to the phone store, does it?

02:38.701 --> 02:39.952
Is this a date?

02:40.035 --> 02:44.456
No, it's not. I just wanted to see
the inside of a phone store.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.125
Why? Did she say something to you?

02:46.208 --> 02:49.295
Told me she saw you naked through
the bullet hole in the twins' bedroom.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.921
Said you got abs.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.006
Kinda.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.842
-Let's hit it. Hmm?
-Oh.

02:54.925 --> 02:59.096
She also said
your nipples are nicely placed.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.977
Have fun, lovebirds.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.148
Here. I put all of our numbers
in your phone.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.233
If you wanna call Barb,
press "Barb."

03:11.317 --> 03:12.610
If you wanna call me,
press "Gloria."

03:12.693 --> 03:13.652
If you wanna call Rooster...

03:13.736 --> 03:15.279
Wait, wait, let me guess.

03:15.362 --> 03:20.284
[chuckles] Sorry, I'm just used to having
to spell it all out for Barb and Rooster.

03:20.367 --> 03:24.121
Yeah, I hear ya.
They're an interesting pair, those two.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.458
The other day, I had to explain
that there's no cotton in cotton candy.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.168
-[chuckles]
-Took a good chunk of the afternoon

03:29.251 --> 03:34.173
and ended with all of us tasting
a little bit of lint from the dryer.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.300
I just hope they don't screw it up.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.676
Maybe you and I should be the ones

03:37.760 --> 03:40.304
to go into the Congresswoman's
and grab the painting.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.140
They should just sit in the car
and pretend to be lookouts or something.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.308
That sounds good.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.935
We also need to pick up some maps

03:46.018 --> 03:49.104
and find a good parking place
where we can sneak in from the back way.

03:49.188 --> 03:51.690
We don't need maps.
You have maps on your phone.

03:51.774 --> 03:53.734
Really? How do you...?

03:53.817 --> 03:56.654
Uh, you just press "maps," right? Right.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.656
Ah.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.867
There is one other thing
I wanted to ask you. [chuckles]

04:01.951 --> 04:04.620
[newswoman on TV] Coronavirus,
which is said to be caused by a bat,

04:04.703 --> 04:09.083
is just the latest in a long line
of infectious diseases caused by animals.

You didn't let me finish.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.171
Didn't need to.
It's not gonna happen.

It's not that big a deal, Jack.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.261
[Jack]
Maybe not to you.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.904
Those kooky ass vegans
might be on to something.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.949
Maybe we should just eat vegetables
and kill all the animals.

04:43.075 --> 04:46.829
I mean, eat the ones we have,
of course, but, you know,

04:46.912 --> 04:49.415
just stop makin'
more chickens and shit.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.291
You're overreacting, Jack.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.837
Overreacting? You asked if I could get
my mother to paint a forgery.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.257
We need one for the job,
and you said your mother could paint.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.342
I am just exploring our options.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.429
Here.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.513
I already have a phone.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.474
A flip phone.
It takes you 20 minutes to type a text.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.476
That's only because
the bottom row is broken

05:09.560 --> 05:11.186
and it takes me a while to figure out

05:11.270 --> 05:13.230
how to respond
without the letters P through Z.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.191
We're gonna need P through Z, Barb.
We're gonna need P through Z.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.611
This is a big job.
It has to be perfect.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.322
Which is why we need
your mom to make a copy of the painting.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.450
Why do we need a painting
if we're stealing a painting?

05:24.533 --> 05:27.119
Because if we can
replace this one with a fake,

05:27.202 --> 05:29.246
no one will realize the real one is gone.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.957
That looks like Stretch Armstrong
and his wife doing it underwater.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.333

05:33.417 --> 05:35.127
It's a lot more difficult than you think.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.629
Which is why
we need someone who can paint.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.174
I'm not implicating my mother in a crime.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.967
Why not? My mother's implicated.

05:42.051 --> 05:45.345
If she does a good job, no one
will even know a crime was committed

05:45.429 --> 05:48.891
unless they try to sell the painting,
like, 20 years from now.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.435
Did you hear that? Twenty years.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.519
How old's your mother?

05:52.603 --> 05:54.188
Seventy-six, I think.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.733
Seventy-six. Do I need to say it?

05:57.816 --> 05:59.610
You don't need to say it.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.736
You know what
I'm talkin' about, though, right?

06:00.819 --> 06:01.904
We know what you're talking about.

but in 20 years... probably less.

Oh, we get it, Barb.

She's gonna be dead,
that's all I'm sayin'.

What does the word "less" mean to you?

22:44.072 --> 22:46.991
Stan was so boring to talk to,
even the gas bubble needed to escape.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.785
Let's go.

22:51.412 --> 22:52.330
Sorry about the ticket.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.583
I don't care.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.461
If the county wants 27 bucks,
they can go dig her up.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.800
Gloria, come take a look at this.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.719
I'm getting out of the shower.
Be down in a sec.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.513
[hair dryer whirring]

23:08.596 --> 23:11.015
James, I know
you are getting these messages.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.184
You've gotta believe me, I'm not a rat.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.393
We're doing this job tonight

23:14.477 --> 23:17.230
and I really don't wanna tell
these people that I can't come through.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.981
I need you for this.

23:19.065 --> 23:23.277
Look, I'll even go 50-50 this time.
Just call me. Please.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.493
Why do you keep lookin' at your phone?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.829
'Cause it's 2020, Jack.
That's where people look.

[siren wails]

23:34.914 --> 23:35.998
Oh, shit. What's this now?

23:38.543 --> 23:40.128
That house right there.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.754
Oh, this isn't good. [grunts]

23:43.422 --> 23:44.715
Where's Barb?

23:44.799 --> 23:45.800
-Who?
-Who?

23:45.883 --> 23:46.843
The bitch who lives here.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.386
Okay, let's settle down.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.012
Would you mind working with me on this?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.889
I'm trying to keep
the temperature to simmer.

23:51.973 --> 23:56.060
Yeah. Sorry. She... She called her Barb
and we call her Barbara,

23:56.144 --> 23:57.019
so I... I wasn't...

23:57.103 --> 23:59.605
Second coat should do it.
I got some snacks for the...

23:59.689 --> 24:01.566

It's been delivered.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.542
Really dig those
ham-hock toes in there, Rooster.

25:01.626 --> 25:06.255
We need to force this bubble to pick
a direction and head towards a hole.

25:06.339 --> 25:07.715
Think of Jean Michel.

[phone rings]

25:12.094 --> 25:14.013
Haven't seen you in here for a while.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.557
Yeah, well, there's
a virus killin' people, Stan,

25:16.641 --> 25:19.727
so I'm tryin' to avoid
unnecessary errands.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.520
Just makin' a quick deposit.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.439
Take your break, Mike.
I got this one.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.275
Barb's a VVIP
and VVIP's get the manager.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.121
[sighs]

25:39.205 --> 25:40.831
How you doin'?

25:40.915 --> 25:42.875
Don't you have a machine for that?

25:42.959 --> 25:44.919
I don't trust it.

Have you tried

If you wanna go sometime,
I could grab one of Mom's placards,

You stole my SodaStream!

I'm sorry, your soda what?

26:18.369 --> 26:19.912
SodaStream!

26:19.996 --> 26:21.956
Ma'am, would you mind
if we search the house?

26:22.039 --> 26:25.876
Oh, wait, are you talking about one of
those machines that makes the fizzy water?

26:25.960 --> 26:28.170
Yes! A SodaStream!

26:28.254 --> 26:30.589
Okay, that's my bad.
It was on our porch.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.967
I just assumed.
I didn't read the label.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.719
They must have delivered it
to the wrong house.

26:34.802 --> 26:38.014
I think somebody owes me an apology.

Oh, thank God.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.001
Okay, so I've done some research.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.794
The Covid thing seems to check out

27:08.878 --> 27:11.797
and you wet my whistle
with the 50-50 proposal, so...

You guys probably thought I would be
the one to screw this whole thing up.

But see, everything's fine.

Excuse me.
Whose car is this?

[inhales]

27:39.533 --> 27:41.869
We're gonna have to find another vehicle

27:41.952 --> 27:43.788
or we're gonna miss the window
to steal this painting.

27:43.871 --> 27:46.290
[sighs] Maybe we should wait then.

27:46.374 --> 27:48.209
Wait? We're not waiting.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.003
I already told Jean Michel
that I had a big surprise for him

27:51.087 --> 27:53.089
and if it's not that I'm stinkin' rich,

27:53.172 --> 27:56.384
I'm gonna have to dye my pubes purple
or something.

27:56.467 --> 27:58.552
Well, I'm just saying,
since we're not prepared,

27:58.636 --> 28:00.596
because Barb
hasn't paid her parking tickets,

28:00.679 --> 28:02.515
then we should just delay it.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.101
Screw that!
We're gettin' rich tonight!

28:05.184 --> 28:07.478
Can't we steal a car
like we did when we robbed Melvin?

28:07.561 --> 28:10.022
Not knowing what we know now
about this virus.

28:10.106 --> 28:11.232
I mean, if the windows were up,

28:11.315 --> 28:14.110
there could be a whole
Covid cloud sealed up in there.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.153
The most important thing
is our health and safety.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.781
Health and safety.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.908
I think I know where we can get a vehicle.

I am not a customer.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.349
I am from the County Health
and Safety Office

28:45.433 --> 28:50.187
and I am afraid I'm gonna have to
confiscate this illegal mobile bikini bus.

a few minutes to walk through the woods,

29:06.412 --> 29:08.539
another ten minutes or so
to break in and make the switch.

29:08.622 --> 29:12.460
Oh, Rooster,
take a picture of me on this pole.

29:12.543 --> 29:15.087
I wanna send it to Jean Michel Duklon.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up.

29:18.299 --> 29:21.969
Jean Michel's never seen a picture of me
from closer than 20 feet away.

between me and the lens.

to get outside again. We all do.

When you were in prison,
did you know any fences?

that surrounded the place.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.555
Oh. I don't know.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.558
I had a cellmate
who was in for selling stolen jewelry.

31:32.641 --> 31:34.351
I'm sure he knew people who'd buy it.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.395
You, uh, remember that guy's name?

What's goin' on?

31:38.063 --> 31:41.442

because I got out early.

31:41.525 --> 31:42.818
We don't have a fence?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.696
I know. I know. I screwed up.

'Cause when I'm in control of everything,
you know, this doesn't happen.

No, no, no, you don't get to bring up shit
that we talked about in prison.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.087
You are not allowed.

32:02.171 --> 32:04.089
Yeah, yeah, I lied about who I was.

Well, I think we might be even now.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.594
We are not even.
This is nothing compared to that.

32:08.677 --> 32:09.511
You played with my heart.

And you're playing with my life.
You said you had a plan.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.224
We should call it off.
We should just call it off.

32:14.308 --> 32:15.976
Call it off? No, no, no, no, no.

32:16.060 --> 32:18.395
You said yourself, you need this money
to get me my new identity.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.939
Do you know anybody with half
a million dollars that likes stolen art?

32:21.023 --> 32:21.857
Because I don't.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.859
So, we'll figure that out.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.403
Maybe my guy in prison has a lead.

32:26.487 --> 32:27.738
Or together you and I
could think of a way

32:27.821 --> 32:29.698
to convince your guy
that you're not a rat.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.076
Somehow, we'll fix this.
I promise.

32:32.159 --> 32:35.204
There hasn't been anything you and I
haven't been able to figure out yet.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.205
We'll get through this.

32:38.040 --> 32:38.874
Okay.

Come on, let's go.

Next time there's a problem,
just tell me.

I know you're used to working alone,
but we're supposed to be a team.
