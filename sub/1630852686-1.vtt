WEBVTT

00:19.311 --> 00:21.939
‐ House, call my son.
Lights on.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.150
‐ It's 2050,
how does this still not work?

00:25.901 --> 00:28.695
Call. My. Son!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.864
And turn down the damn lights.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.367
Hi, Mom.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.785
‐ Oh, hi, sweetie!

00:34.785 --> 00:38.330
Oh, you look tired.
Okay, thanks for calling.

00:38.330 --> 00:41.917
‐ Are you busy?
Not really. Just finished studying.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.711
‐ Good 'cause I wanna tell you

00:44.711 --> 00:47.130
the story of how I met your father.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.841
SON:
I already know how you met Dad.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.926
‐ Ah, you know the basics,

00:50.926 --> 00:54.137
but it's time for me to tell you
the unabridged version.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.849
How many glasses
of that wine have you had?

00:56.849 --> 00:59.351
‐ Just enough to include the sexy bits.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.563
SON:
Oh good god, here we go.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.941
‐ Now, like a lot of
love stories back in 2022,

01:05.941 --> 01:07.943
this one starts with a Tinder date.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.194
‐ Excuse me.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.197
Actually, it starts with me
being late to a Tinder date.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.116
‐ Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

01:14.116 --> 01:16.201
‐ Uh, Sophie?
‐ Yeah!

01:16.201 --> 01:17.911
‐ Hey, I'm Jesse.
This is my best friend Sid.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.580
Don't mind him, he's just hitching a ride.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.665
‐ Oh! Ask me why I'm hitching a ride.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.253
Come on! Ask me!
‐ Uh, w‐why are you hitching a ride, Sid?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.630
‐ I'm proposing to my girlfriend tonight.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.592
Wow, girlfriend! Not gonna be
saying that much longer!

01:31.592 --> 01:33.844
Someone's gonna be nothing but fiancée!

01:33.844 --> 01:36.305
Fiancée! Fiancée! Fiancée!

01:36.305 --> 01:39.057
‐ Sophie, be a dear and choke me out
with this charging cord, would you?

01:39.057 --> 01:40.809
‐ Ooh, actually, can I use it

01:40.809 --> 01:43.228
'cause my phone's belly is hungry.
She's all,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.731
:
"Feed me, Mama!"

01:47.065 --> 01:48.609
Okay, tell me everything.
Who is she?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.360
‐ Okay, so her name's Hannah.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.862
She's a surgical resident in LA,

01:51.862 --> 01:53.322
so we've been doing
the long‐distance thing

01:53.322 --> 01:55.365
while I'm here
running my bar, Pemberton's.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.576
‐ Uh, look at you,
locking down a surgeon!

01:57.576 --> 01:59.036
How you gonna ask her?

01:59.036 --> 02:01.371
‐ So, she thinks we're gonna go
see Beyoncé tonight,

02:01.371 --> 02:04.583
but really, I got all our friends
waiting at my bar to surprise her.

02:05.584 --> 02:08.587
‐ You think she's gonna be a little bummed
that you're not actually seeing Beyoncé?

02:08.587 --> 02:09.713
‐ I keep telling him
she's gonna be bummed.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.715
‐ Okay, a lifetime with me
is better than Beyoncé.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.510
‐ Sure.
‐ Hm...

02:14.510 --> 02:16.345
So, uh, what about you, Sophie?

02:16.345 --> 02:18.347
What's going on at the Rosewood bar?

02:19.181 --> 02:21.016
‐ Okay, uh,

02:21.016 --> 02:22.643
I know this might sound crazy,

02:22.643 --> 02:24.937
but I think I've found the man

02:24.937 --> 02:27.022
that I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.273
‐ Hm.
‐ Yeah.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.235
Only thing is he's from Tinder, and we
haven't actually met in real life yet.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.612
‐ Oh, very You've Got Mail.

02:33.612 --> 02:37.157
‐ More like you've got unrealistic
expectations for this date.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.785
‐ Okay, I‐I know how this sounds,

02:39.785 --> 02:42.079
but I am not some wide‐eyed dope

02:42.079 --> 02:45.541
who thinks she's found true love
every time some douchey ibanker

02:45.541 --> 02:48.043
swipes right and texts, "'Sup?"

02:48.043 --> 02:50.546
My last Tinder date was the worst one yet.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.172
The guy showed up 20 minutes late.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.967
‐ Sophie? Sorry, I'm late.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.553
‐ Oh. That's okay.

02:57.553 --> 02:58.720
Subway delay?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.764
‐ Uh, no, actually, I was, uh...

03:00.764 --> 03:02.641
I was on another date
before this, and, uh,

03:02.641 --> 03:03.809
let's just say it went well.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.143
Like, uh...

03:06.019 --> 03:07.521
Like really well.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.982
Like, I just had sex.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.942
‐ He told you that?!
‐ Why would he tell you that?!

03:11.942 --> 03:13.402
‐ That's not even the worst part.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.197
He actually thought that telling me
he just had sex was charming.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.158
He thought I'd just laugh
and smile and say,

03:20.158 --> 03:23.412
"That's so crazy!" Because,
God forbid, a woman in this city

03:23.412 --> 03:25.706
actually expects anything from a guy,

03:25.706 --> 03:28.166
even if it's just the basic
decency to not tell her

03:28.166 --> 03:30.669
he just had sexual intercourse
with someone else!

03:30.669 --> 03:32.421
What is wrong with everyone?!

03:34.631 --> 03:36.717
And right there, outside that bar,

03:36.717 --> 03:38.343
I decided to quit Tinder.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.763
But when I went to deactivate
my account...

03:41.763 --> 03:43.974
I matched with Ian.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.685
‐ You matched with Ian?!
She matched with Ian.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.020
‐ Yeah.
‐ It started with

03:48.020 --> 03:51.899
your typical flirty banter,
you know, just getting to know you stuff.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.526
Who was your first celebrity crush?

03:54.526 --> 03:57.404
IAN:
Tia Mowry. You?

03:57.404 --> 03:59.198
SOPHIE:
Buzz Lightyear.

03:59.198 --> 04:02.492
IAN:
Oh, an astronaut made of plastic...

04:02.492 --> 04:03.827
Freaky!

04:05.287 --> 04:07.956
‐ And then we started to
actually get to know each other.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.375
IAN:
What kind of photography do you do?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.794
Right now,
I shoot stuff like birthday parties

04:12.794 --> 04:14.838
and engagement photos to pay the rent,

04:14.838 --> 04:17.508
but my heart
is in street photography.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.967
IAN:
That's when you sneak up on a stranger,

04:18.967 --> 04:21.887
take their picture, and then run away
before they punch you, right?

04:21.887 --> 04:24.264
SOPHIE:
That's exactly right.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.308
What do you do?
I know this sounds made up,

04:26.308 --> 04:28.727
but I'm a marine biologist.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.230
SOPHIE:
That is 100% made up.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.566
‐ And before long,
we were texting all day.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.235
All night, too.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.570
First kiss?
Mabel Greyhound, seventh grade.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.614
- You cook?
- One of my favorite hobbies.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.453
IAN:
I've been thinkin' about you all day.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.830
‐ Oh my god, Ian,
ask a girl out already!

04:48.830 --> 04:51.583
‐ I was thinking the exact same thing!

04:51.583 --> 04:54.878
So, are you ever gonna ask me
to meet you in real life?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.338
IAN:
I'd love to,

04:56.338 --> 04:59.758
but I'm in Australia for work
for the next two weeks.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.135
‐ So, we made plans to meet up
when he got back,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.054
and that brings us to tonight,

05:04.054 --> 05:06.431
and my last first date ever.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.433
‐ Wow, that's romantic as hell.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.060
‐ I know, right?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.563
What does the killjoy think?
‐ Hey!

05:12.563 --> 05:15.190
Look, I got a real good
feeling about this Ian guy.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.734
No, no. I can't do it.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.611
No, the truth is the chances of this guy

05:19.611 --> 05:21.697
being your soul mate are lower than low.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.074
I mean, there's a better chance of you
giving me a five‐star review

05:24.074 --> 05:26.076
after this rude assessment I'm making.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.204
Speaking of which,
don't forget your phone.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.039
‐ Ah. Thanks.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.166
Uh, happy proposing.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.251
SID:
Thank you.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.843
‐ What?
‐ Ooh... You liked her.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.802
‐ Did not.

05:43.802 --> 05:44.970
‐ Did, too.
‐ Did not!

05:44.970 --> 05:46.972
‐ Did not.
‐ Did, too‐‐ Dammit.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.439
‐ Ian?

05:55.439 --> 05:56.648
‐ Sophie!

05:56.648 --> 05:58.108
‐ Hi.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.193
‐ Hi.

05:59.735 --> 06:03.322
‐ And thus began the best first date
I'd ever been on.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.658
A date so good, you don't
even check your phone.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.493
SOPHIE'S SON: Whoa.
‐ I know.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.957
‐ You know, we should go see
that new movie next week

06:13.957 --> 06:16.752
where walking Joaquin Phoenix
plays Amelia Earhart.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.545
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And then it happened.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.089
‐ What?

06:22.007 --> 06:23.842
‐ Okay, so...

06:23.842 --> 06:25.219
Sophie, the thing is...

06:25.219 --> 06:27.679
I'm moving to Australia.

06:29.515 --> 06:30.933
‐ You just got back from there.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.309
‐ I know.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.228
It was only supposed
to be a research trip,

06:34.228 --> 06:37.105
but right before I left,
they offered me a full‐time job

06:37.105 --> 06:39.608
on a team that's helping
endangered coral reef procreate.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.362
‐ Can't you just...

06:43.362 --> 06:45.781
light a candle
and put on some soft rock?

06:45.781 --> 06:47.658
I mean, that always works for me.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.704
When are you leaving?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.249
‐ Tonight.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.000
‐ Tonight.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.546
‐ I only came back to New York
to pack and sublet my place.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.340
I know I should have
told you this sooner.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.050
I was just afraid
that you wouldn't come,

07:05.050 --> 07:06.301
and...

07:07.344 --> 07:09.471
I had to meet you, Sophie.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.725
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And so,

07:13.725 --> 07:15.894
we decided it would be a bad idea

07:15.894 --> 07:17.938
to start a long‐distance relationship

07:17.938 --> 07:20.524
after just a few weeks of texting

07:20.524 --> 07:22.067
and an amazing first date.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.238
‐ Goodbye, Sophie.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.991
‐ Goodbye, Ian.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.870
‐ Uh...

07:33.745 --> 07:36.373
I kind of wanna kiss you right now.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.334
‐ I kind of want that, too.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.133
Uh... I think it's best if we don't.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.386
Maybe someday.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.224
‐ Yeah. Someday.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.911
‐ I was devastated.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.122
But at least I was coming home
to my bestie,

08:17.122 --> 08:18.707
Aunt Valentina!

08:18.707 --> 08:21.084
She was just back
from Fashion Week in London.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.337
SOPHIE:
Oh! I'm so happy you're home.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.630
I missed you so much.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.173
‐ We don't have time for
"I miss yous!" Dish.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.549
How was your date with Ian? Was he tall?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.635
‐ Yes.
‐ Was he a good listener?

08:29.635 --> 08:30.636
‐ Yes.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.138
‐ Were his eyes as kind as his photo?

08:33.138 --> 08:34.223
‐ Yes!

08:36.683 --> 08:38.310
‐ Why aren't you jumping?

08:39.144 --> 08:41.939
‐ Because he's moving to Australia.

08:43.941 --> 08:46.944
‐ Soph, I am so sorry.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.238
Did you bang one out anyway?

08:51.865 --> 08:53.742
‐ Oh, at least I still have you.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.410
You know what? We can just be

08:55.410 --> 08:57.704
two single New York ladies
doing it for ourselves.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.124
We can start a podcast called
"Who Needs Men?"

09:01.124 --> 09:03.961
‐ Ah! Yeah! Uh, about that‐‐

09:03.961 --> 09:05.003
‐ We can workshop the title later.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.756
‐ Oh my god!
‐ My god!

09:07.756 --> 09:09.049
A pervert! A pervert!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.343
‐ Please don't spray me!
I have an extremely delicate face!

09:11.343 --> 09:14.805
‐ He's not a pervert.
This is Charlie.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.058
Okay, he's sort of a pervert,
but in a good way,

09:18.517 --> 09:20.102
‐ You must be Sophie.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.145
It's a real pleasure‐‐ Oh my god.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.648
I'll go round up a robe.

09:26.108 --> 09:27.401
‐ Y‐‐ Funny story.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.612
We me at London Fashion Week.
Hit it off...

09:31.113 --> 09:32.614
big time.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.324
One thing led to another,

09:34.324 --> 09:37.995
and now he... lives with us.
So, back to you and Ian‐‐

09:37.995 --> 09:40.247
‐ Wait, what?!
‐ I know, this is fast,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.749
but when he told his crazy fancy

09:42.749 --> 09:45.878
"high society" family
that he was heading to New York

09:45.878 --> 09:49.047
to be with a Mexican assistant stylist,

09:49.047 --> 09:51.466
they made some very
outdated Ugly Betty jabs,

09:51.466 --> 09:53.510
and then they cut off his trust fund!

09:55.179 --> 09:56.847
‐ They Meghan Markled you guys.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.223
‐ Although, it's for the best.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.892
I mean, who needs
unlimited wealth and palaces?

09:59.892 --> 10:03.437
I will get by on my charm
and my street smarts.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.940
‐ I can see your penis again.
‐ Oh!

10:06.940 --> 10:09.318
Stay in there, lad.
‐ Hm.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.944
‐ There my undies are!

10:11.737 --> 10:13.780
That's right. Completely forgot

10:13.780 --> 10:16.033
we started out here
with all the fruit play.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.207
‐ You might wanna toss those, too.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.458
‐ These were organic!

10:26.627 --> 10:29.755
So, I said I know this is fast,
but I am super into him,

10:29.755 --> 10:32.925
and I decided I am not
gonna let something as irrational

10:32.925 --> 10:34.843
as rational thinking
stand in the way of that.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.929
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And that's when I realized...

10:36.929 --> 10:39.973
‐ I let rational thinking stand
in the way of me and Ian.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.683
I mean, sure, he's moving
to a different continent,

10:41.683 --> 10:44.728
but, you know, I've got tons of miles.
We can always have Facesex.

10:44.728 --> 10:46.730
‐ Whoa, what is Facesex?
‐ I think she's mixing up

10:46.730 --> 10:47.731
Facetime and phone sex.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.525
I'm the cool friend.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.736
‐ I have to tell Ian that
ending things was a mistake.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.530
‐ Yes. Yes!

10:54.530 --> 10:57.115
Tell him. Oh, I'd love that for you!

10:57.115 --> 10:58.617
And this is where you say you love

10:58.617 --> 11:01.078
my "British guy moves in with us"
plan for me.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.875
‐ Ah! This isn't my phone.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.879
I must've taken the wrong one
when I got out of the Uber!

11:10.879 --> 11:13.298
I've gotta get to Pemberton's right now.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.051
‐ Can we come with?
Can't wait to see the real New York.

11:16.051 --> 11:17.219
Can we take a subway?

11:17.219 --> 11:19.805
I've always wanted to see
what the subway's like!

11:19.805 --> 11:21.807
So, that's what a subway is like.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.726
Does it always smell like that?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.854
‐ No! Sometimes, it's way worse.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.148
One time, I was in a car where one guy
was peeing, one guy was pooping,

11:30.148 --> 11:32.818
and one guy was dead.
‐ Ah, the subway trifecta.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.069
Hope you made a wish.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.618
Surprise!

11:41.618 --> 11:44.371
Sophie! You're not Sid.
Why are you not Sid?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.540
‐ Because you gave me his phone
instead of mine

11:46.540 --> 11:47.666
when I got out of your car.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.251
‐ Wait, so I've been
tracking you this whole time?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.919
Okay, guys, we do not have eyes on Sid!

11:50.919 --> 11:52.504
Everyone, back to your hiding spots.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.714
‐ Okay, what is Sid's ETA?

11:53.714 --> 11:55.549
‐ Literally any second,
so I really need you to hide.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.843
‐ Good, good, 'cause I'm not sure
what time Ian's flight is,

11:57.843 --> 11:59.720
but I've gotta talk to him
before the plane takes off.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.221
‐ For the love of god, hide!

12:02.431 --> 12:03.932
‐ I freeze under pressure!

12:03.932 --> 12:05.642
This is why I've been hit
by three Citi Bikes!

12:15.402 --> 12:17.279
‐ What are you doing?

12:17.279 --> 12:20.032
‐ Still smelling that train.
It's in my hair.

12:20.032 --> 12:22.743
There's a stranger's body odor
trapped in my hair.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.496
‐ Um, hello!

12:26.496 --> 12:28.916
‐ Sorry. Didn't see you there.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.377
‐ I know. That's why I said, "Um, hello."

12:32.377 --> 12:35.714
I was feeling creepier and creepier
with every second that passed.

12:35.714 --> 12:37.966
I'm Ellen.
I just moved here from Iowa.

12:37.966 --> 12:38.926
‐ Mm.
‐ Oh,

12:38.926 --> 12:41.595
and I'm Jesse's sister.
Adopted, obviously.

12:41.595 --> 12:45.140
‐ I mean, it's not obvious to me.
I have no idea who Jesse is.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.518
Have you taken the train yet?
It's an underground freak show.

12:47.518 --> 12:49.811
‐ We get it. You hated the train.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.856
‐ So, what brings you to New York?

12:52.856 --> 12:53.857
‐ I'm getting divorced.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.151
‐ Oh...
‐ Oh my god, you poor thing.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.779
‐ Little Crescent, Iowa,
has 600 people in it,

12:58.779 --> 13:00.447
and she was the only other lesbian.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.033
We both knew it had run its course,

13:03.033 --> 13:06.203
so I moved to New York to start over,
reconnect with my brother...

13:07.079 --> 13:08.455
and ask out Kate McKinnon.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.666
‐ Whoa! Do you know Kate McKinnon?

13:10.666 --> 13:11.917
‐ No.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.752
Do you?

13:15.587 --> 13:18.048
‐ Where the hell are they?
‐ Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Look, look.

13:18.048 --> 13:20.717
Sid is my best friend, okay?
And if he were in charge of my proposal‐‐

13:20.717 --> 13:22.761
Purely hypothetical,
I'm never getting married,

13:22.761 --> 13:24.388
but he would make sure
it was perfect, alright?

13:24.388 --> 13:26.515
So, I can't have your peeking
head ruining his big night.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.017
‐ Alright, alright.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.728
Why are you never getting married?

13:31.728 --> 13:34.231
‐ Uh, I'm never getting married

13:34.231 --> 13:37.276
because the one girl I wanted
to marry broke my heart, okay?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.862
‐ Wait a second.
‐ No.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.781
‐ I know you.
‐ And here we go.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.284
You are the guy from the video!

13:45.284 --> 13:47.411
FUTURE SOPHIE:
The video was an unfortunate incident

13:47.411 --> 13:49.496
that had recently gone viral.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.791
‐ Jesse. I'm sorry. I...
She's gonna say no. Oh my god.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.710
‐ What a nightmare.
‐ This poor schmuck.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.462
‐ What a loser.
‐ What a disaster.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.759
‐ Now, she's in Europe,
recording her first solo album,

14:02.759 --> 14:05.971
and I'm known all around
the city as Mr. Proposal Fail.

14:05.971 --> 14:09.057
You know who liked the video
last week on Twitter? Michelle Obama.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.520
‐ How did you forget
the Beyoncé tickets at the bar?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.272
ALL:
Surprise!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.275
‐ What's happening?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.277
‐ Hannah...

14:21.778 --> 14:23.822
I remember the moment
I fell in love with you.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.743
It was our first year of med school,

14:27.743 --> 14:29.661
and we were dissecting dead bodies,

14:29.661 --> 14:31.163
and, um,

14:31.163 --> 14:33.540
you leaned over,
and you said to me, you said,

14:33.540 --> 14:35.542
"Hey, you know how to get to the stomach?

14:36.585 --> 14:38.045
You take the spleen‐ic route."

14:39.505 --> 14:41.298
And I thought, oh...

14:43.675 --> 14:44.968
This is the girl for me.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.637
Aww...

14:47.971 --> 14:50.390
Hannah, I believe we can make it
through anything together.

14:51.099 --> 14:54.645
Even if sometimes,
we take the spleen‐ic route.

14:54.645 --> 14:56.647
So...

14:59.900 --> 15:02.861
Hannah...

15:05.113 --> 15:06.156
Will you marry me?

15:07.115 --> 15:08.408
‐ Yes!

15:10.661 --> 15:11.703
Yes!

15:13.455 --> 15:15.791
Oh, I can't believe I'm getting engaged

15:15.791 --> 15:17.876
and seeing Beyoncé!

15:17.876 --> 15:19.503
‐ Oh...

15:20.045 --> 15:22.130
‐ I can't believe I'm getting engaged!

15:28.554 --> 15:30.597
‐ Look at that!
A proposal that won't haunt

15:30.597 --> 15:32.182
and traumatize them forever.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.142
Good for him.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.396
‐ I love you so much.
‐ I love you more.

15:37.396 --> 15:40.858
‐ And I love hilarious phone mishaps.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.237
We swapped in the Uber.
Mazel tov, by the way.

15:45.696 --> 15:48.323
‐ Uh, here. It's dead,
which feels very on brand for you.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.825
Um, I'm sorry.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.368
‐ Mm!

15:52.995 --> 15:54.705
‐ Oh my god.
‐ What?

15:54.705 --> 15:57.541
‐ There were so many men
urinating in there at once.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.543
Just a cacophony of piss.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.881
‐ Wait, now you're
too fancy for stalls?

16:03.881 --> 16:05.883
‐ Darling, I use stalls.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.552
That's where we keep the ponies.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.430
Valentina, I think I've made
a terrible mistake.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.515
I don't think I can live
in this hellscape.

16:13.515 --> 16:16.226
‐ This hellscape is my daily life,

16:16.226 --> 16:17.644
you prissy royal bitch.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
‐ Hey...

16:21.982 --> 16:23.066
‐ Mm!

16:23.066 --> 16:25.319
‐ Mm?
‐ Mm! One‐‐ one second.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.737
Alright.

16:27.446 --> 16:28.822
Oh my god.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.533
A lung just became
available for my patient!

16:31.533 --> 16:32.910
Yes! Oh!

16:32.910 --> 16:34.786
Honey, oh...

16:34.786 --> 16:37.497
Oh, it's all over your shirt.
‐ It's okay.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.293
‐ Babe, I am so sorry,
but I have to get back to LA.

16:42.503 --> 16:45.380
‐ Hey, hey. Look, my sister's
hanging out with your friends.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.549
She's kind of a loner, so I
really want her to meet people.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.929
‐ Yeah. Seems like
they're really hitting it off.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.056
‐ Mm.
‐ Hey,

16:54.056 --> 16:56.141
as soon as my phone powers on,
I'm out of here,

16:56.141 --> 16:58.936
but I wanted to tell you,
you can't give up on love

16:58.936 --> 17:01.647
just because of your proposal fail.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.899
I know that there is
a Brooklyn Bridge girl

17:03.899 --> 17:05.984
out there for you somewhere.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.780
‐ Am I supposed to know what that is?
Because you look like

17:09.780 --> 17:11.490
you practically moved yourself
to tears just now,

17:11.490 --> 17:13.659
but I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.954
‐ It's this thing I made up.
‐ Okay.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.706
‐ See, I've lived in New York
since college,

17:19.706 --> 17:22.084
but I've never walked across
the Brooklyn Bridge,

17:22.084 --> 17:23.961
and after a while,
I waited so long

17:23.961 --> 17:27.172
that I decided I would wait
and walk it with my soulmate.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.718
‐ You're one of those people whose parents
actually stayed married, aren't you?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.095
College sweethearts,

17:33.095 --> 17:34.680
married for 30 years sort of thing.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.181
So you're like, if they found each other,

17:36.181 --> 17:37.766
there must be someone
out there for everyone.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.643
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right?

17:40.185 --> 17:42.229
‐ Yeah. Something like that.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.439
‐ Must be nice.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.401
Those of us who grew up
in the real world, not so sure.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.945
Looks like your phone's back.
‐ Yes!

17:51.154 --> 17:52.990
Aw.

17:52.990 --> 17:56.118
Ian sent me a pic holding his
boarding pass and looking sad.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.662
‐ Aww.
‐ I'm gonna call him.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.874
Wait, look.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.668
I can see all of his flight info.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.838
‐ Cool. He's got TSA PreCheck.

18:07.838 --> 18:10.090
‐ He would!

18:10.090 --> 18:12.426
I've always talked
about getting that.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.094
But it's like a whole thing.
No, not the point.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.141
I'm going to go to JFK
and tell him that we're meant to be.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.935
‐ Really?
‐ Hey, uh, can I borrow your car?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.854
I need to take Hannah to the airport.

18:23.854 --> 18:26.356
‐ What?
‐ Emergency surgery calls.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.276
‐ Seems like the universe wants me
to take everyone to the airport.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.944
‐ Alright. Let's go.
‐ Okay. What, are you coming?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.196
‐ I am! Oh!

18:33.322 --> 18:34.698
‐ Wait!

18:34.698 --> 18:36.909
You can't leave me alone with Charlie.
I think I hate him.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.953
‐ We live with him.
‐ I know!

18:41.538 --> 18:44.958
‐ Valentina, don't abandon me!
I have nowhere to go!

18:44.958 --> 18:47.252
I'll need to sell my body to survive!

18:50.172 --> 18:52.174
‐ Hey, sis!
Uh, we're all going to the airport.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.134
‐ You forgot me, didn't you?

18:54.134 --> 18:56.011
‐ What? Who could for‐‐

18:56.011 --> 18:57.429
Yeah. Completely forgot you. I'm sorry.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.646
FUTURE SOPHIE:
And so, we all went to JFK

19:05.646 --> 19:08.815
to tell him that I wanted us
to be together.

19:10.067 --> 19:11.568
‐ There he is.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.572
‐ Oh god, don't let this be
the next Proposal Fail.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.449
Wait! Aren't you‐‐

19:17.449 --> 19:20.702
‐ It's actually Mr. Proposal Fail,
but yes.

19:22.120 --> 19:22.704
‐ Ian!

19:23.956 --> 19:26.124
‐ Sophie? What are you‐‐

19:26.124 --> 19:28.001
‐ I've been on 87 Tinder dates this year.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.379
Okay, all of them were duds.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.465
Just to be clear, I don't do,
like, sexy stuff with all the guys.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.718
A lot of the times, I just have
a white wine and talk.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.012
I also want to be clear
that I am not judging anyone

19:39.012 --> 19:40.472
who does hook up on every date.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.474
It's just not my style.
But if it's someone else's,

19:42.474 --> 19:44.268
that's her business,
and it's nothing to be ashamed of.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.228
‐ This is getting away from her.

19:47.271 --> 19:49.982
‐ Look, what I'm trying to say is that

19:49.982 --> 19:51.859
we live in confusing times,

19:51.859 --> 19:54.194
where it's really hard to meet someone

19:54.194 --> 19:56.363
and‐and‐and connect and have it feel...

19:57.698 --> 19:58.740
Easy.

19:59.408 --> 20:02.160
And tonight, it felt easy.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.621
Other than the Australia thing,

20:04.621 --> 20:07.332
which feels insurmountably hard,

20:07.332 --> 20:08.667
but we can get through it.

20:10.169 --> 20:11.670
I know that we can.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.174
What do you say?

20:17.551 --> 20:19.970
‐ Sophie, I'd love
to make it work, but...

20:20.804 --> 20:23.348
it's a 14‐hour time difference,

20:23.348 --> 20:25.267
and I'm gonna be living

20:25.267 --> 20:27.895
out at sea for weeks
on end without service.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.148
It'd just be way too hard.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.108
‐ Oh, this is brutal.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.695
‐ I'm really sorry, Sophie.

20:36.695 --> 20:39.072
But, maybe someday, right?

20:39.072 --> 20:41.700
‐ Yeah. Maybe.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.672
But I didn't
want to wait around for some day.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.972
‐ I'm doing it!

21:03.972 --> 21:07.184
I'm walking the bridge
without the love of my life!

21:08.143 --> 21:10.354
Sounded more triumphant in my head.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.647
‐ You walk that bridge, girl.

21:12.898 --> 21:16.109
That... surprisingly clean and...

21:16.109 --> 21:17.611
actually rather majestic bridge.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.322
‐ You don't have to pretend
to like this for me.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.283
‐ I'm not pretending.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.786
You know,
I‐I really do think it's stunning.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.790
Brimming with...
with life and personality.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.795
Like you.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.467
‐ Charlie, do you know one of
the reasons I fell so hard for you?

21:41.009 --> 21:44.096
‐ Because my charm is all boy,
but my body is all man?

21:44.930 --> 21:46.682
‐ No.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.642
It's because I thought you were brave.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.604
You've lived this
incredibly pampered life,

21:52.604 --> 21:54.314
but you walked away from it all.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.359
To take a chance on us.

21:59.069 --> 22:00.863
Charlie...

22:00.863 --> 22:02.906
this city is magic!

22:04.199 --> 22:05.826
And so am I.

22:08.579 --> 22:11.623
Do you wanna be a part
of that magic or not?

22:13.208 --> 22:14.710
‐ I do.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.004
Very, very much.

22:23.177 --> 22:26.555
‐ If Sophie can walk across
this bridge totally alone

22:26.555 --> 22:28.098
and Sid can have

22:28.098 --> 22:31.018
a good attitude about
his fiancée ditching him,

22:31.018 --> 22:33.854
and you two can try to make your...

22:33.854 --> 22:35.522
completely doomed relationship work...

22:35.522 --> 22:36.523
‐ Hey!
Ellen!

22:36.982 --> 22:40.194
‐ ...then I can stop obsessing
over my divorce

22:40.194 --> 22:42.196
and ask a woman out to divorce!

22:43.030 --> 22:45.199
To divorce. To dinner! Dammit!

22:45.199 --> 22:46.742
‐ You'll get there.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.706
‐ This is good for Soph.
She needed this.

22:52.706 --> 22:56.043
‐ What? She's gonna be fine.
She's got her parents' magic love story

22:56.043 --> 22:58.170
to keep her stupidly optimistic.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.880
‐ Magic love story?
‐ Yeah.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.382
‐ Sophie's mom is a party girl

23:02.382 --> 23:04.760
who bounces around
from boyfriend to boyfriend.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.970
Her dad wasn't even in the picture.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.139
The only thing
magical about Sophie's life

23:09.139 --> 23:11.141
is that she still believes in love at all.

23:13.477 --> 23:15.896
‐ How have I never walked
this bridge before?

23:15.896 --> 23:17.397
I told you!

23:18.106 --> 23:20.234
‐ Whoo!
‐ Now, we're talking!

23:20.234 --> 23:22.903
Listen, what are we gonna do for dinner?
Because it's late...

23:25.364 --> 23:27.658
‐ Thanks for having us
over for drinks, guys!

23:27.658 --> 23:28.992
‐ Yeah, of course. I mean,

23:28.992 --> 23:31.495
hot engagement sex,

23:31.495 --> 23:33.664
drinks with total strangers...

23:34.331 --> 23:35.874
Two equally good things.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.921
‐ Wow. Love your place!

23:40.921 --> 23:42.589
‐ Thanks. It was a total score.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.550
We got it from
this old married couple

23:44.550 --> 23:46.844
who posted it
on the Wesleyan Alumni Group.

23:46.844 --> 23:48.428
We even got them
to leave their swords.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.597
‐ Wow. Nice touch.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.059
FUTURE SOPHIE:
So, that's it.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.561
That's the night I met your father.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.945
SOPHIE'S SON:
But you guys didn't even get together.

24:04.945 --> 24:06.530
‐ Get together? Oh!

24:06.530 --> 24:08.156
That's a much longer story.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.658
Now, where was I?

24:10.534 --> 24:12.411
Where'd I put that bottle of wine?
