00:58.600 --> 01:00.600
Hello, everyone!

01:00.640 --> 01:03.040
Hello!

01:03.080 --> 01:05.120
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.720
Thanks, everyone.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.360
Hello.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.440
-Thank you.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.600
JAMES: Thank you.
-Thank you so much, everyone.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.120
Thank you and welcome.
Welcome!

01:20.160 --> 01:23.800
And in this show,
we have literally everything

01:23.840 --> 01:26.880
the motoring enthusiast
could possibly want.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.720
A shopping centre...

01:30.760 --> 01:33.040
an explosion...

01:33.080 --> 01:35.240
and a man banging a pole.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.200
Exciting stuff, isn't it?

01:42.240 --> 01:46.640
That... That is all to come -
but we start with this.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.720
If you're wealthy
and you have nothing
to do all day long,

01:49.760 --> 01:52.240
you're going to develop
a drink problem.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.600
It's inevitable
and it always happens.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.000
Paul Gascoigne,
Queen Mother...

01:58.880 --> 02:01.360
-James May.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.640
But if you're from
the United Arab Emirates,

02:04.680 --> 02:06.440
you can't do that.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.080
So instead, they buy toys
that run on the stuff

02:10.120 --> 02:12.040
that made them rich
in the first place.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.320
What, gold?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.520
No, James. Not gold.
Go and have another gin.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.480
That's why this week,

02:17.520 --> 02:19.920
I've taken The Grand Tour
to Dubai.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.640
So let's start out here.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.000
And let's start with this.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.560
Ah-ha-ha!

02:43.600 --> 02:45.560
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

02:47.280 --> 02:50.600
This is what's called
a Sandrail.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.320
A vehicle built specifically
to play in places like this.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.040
Whoo! Ha-ha!

03:02.400 --> 03:05.480
Admittedly, they were
invented in the USA.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.400
But here in the UAE,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.440
things are a bit more
hardcore.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.520
In America, they turn these
out with 300, 400 horsepower.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.760
Over here,
they've dialled that up.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.440
To 1500.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.120
Ho-ho!

03:24.160 --> 03:26.360
And they run them on
these incredibly aggressive

03:26.400 --> 03:28.720
paddle-style tyres.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.640
Which means
it can accelerate from 0-60

03:30.680 --> 03:32.760
in under three seconds.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.920
That's supercar speeds -
on sand!

03:38.600 --> 03:40.360
Holy mo... It's...

03:41.960 --> 03:44.120
Roughing hell!

03:44.160 --> 03:46.680
I'm doing  wheelies!

03:50.240 --> 03:52.880
Jesus! Ohh-ho!

03:54.520 --> 03:55.440
That's insane!

03:59.800 --> 04:02.160
I'm in love!

04:05.760 --> 04:07.760
Keen to see what else
the locals are driving,

04:09.760 --> 04:11.840
I headed back into town.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.080
This is called the Ripsaw

04:18.120 --> 04:20.880
and it's built
by a small American firm

04:20.920 --> 04:25.360
who specialise in extreme
off-road vehicles.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.720
Their customers
are mainly the military

04:27.760 --> 04:30.600
and the people who make
the Fast & Furious films.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.880
However,
if you have the money -

04:34.920 --> 04:36.680
uh...look where we are -

04:36.720 --> 04:39.400
you can have a Ripsaw
built just for you,

04:39.440 --> 04:41.560
as your own private run-about.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.520
So, let's see what it's like.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.800
Oh, and straight away we are
in thumbs-up territory.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.680
Gull-wing doors.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.560
Safety.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.160
It's a tank. I'm in a tank.
It's matte black.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.920
Ha-ha-ha!

05:09.960 --> 05:11.120
I'm on the road!

05:13.560 --> 05:16.520
Because each Ripsaw
is custom-made,

05:16.560 --> 05:19.120
there is no definitive
price list.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.520
But I can tell you,

05:20.560 --> 05:25.920
this one cost its owner
around Â£300,000.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.320
For that,
you get what's billed as
a high-end luxury supertank.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.680
And if you're nine,
which I am,

05:32.720 --> 05:34.560
it doesn't get much better
than that.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.040
On the luxury front,
I've got air-con,

05:39.080 --> 05:41.720
electrically adjusted
leather seats, stereo.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.040
I mean, it's hardly
a Bentley Bentayga in here

05:44.080 --> 05:46.560
but look at all the controls
and switches.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.520
I've got winches,
work lights,

05:48.560 --> 05:50.600
a light bar.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.920
And who doesn't want

05:51.960 --> 05:54.280
a Thunderbirds-style
steering wheel?

05:58.840 --> 06:00.360
Ooh. Roundabout.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.560
Yeah.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.280
Ooh. Yeah, I'll be honest,

06:12.320 --> 06:14.520
visibility is a bit poor
out the sides.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.000
It should
get marked down for that.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.160
And it turns out

06:21.200 --> 06:25.920
visibility isn't the Ripsaw's
only drawback as a city car.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.440
So here I am at the shops,
looking for a parking space.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.280
As you do.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.520
And... Well,
you can see for yourself.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.440
They haven't thought
somebody might turn up
in one of these.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.560
Thankfully, because
the Ripsaw weighs
nearly four tonnes,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.560
and is a tank,

06:43.600 --> 06:45.040
it can get round this issue.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.000
There we go.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.320
I think at the next
management meeting,

07:01.360 --> 07:04.320
they'll be having a serious
rethink about the width
of their parking spaces.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
Morning, shoppers.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.400
To be fair, this is
a very big shopping centre.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.760
This is easier than walking.
It's miles.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.000
Ooh, that reminds me.
I need to get cat food.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.480
Unfortunately,
I couldn't find the pet shop

07:34.520 --> 07:37.560
so it was time to leave.

07:37.600 --> 07:41.240
I'm going to go out the way
I came in. I don't want to
make too much mess.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.080
And right now,
you'll be thinking:

07:43.120 --> 07:45.040
how's he going to do
a three-point-turn
in that thing?

07:45.080 --> 07:47.280
Ah, this is actually better
than that.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.760
For in-town manoeuvrability,
this is a tremendous feature.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.640
I'm surprised more
manufacturers don't fit it.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.640
Although the Ripsaw is,
in its own unique way,

08:01.680 --> 08:03.280
a good town run-about,

08:03.320 --> 08:05.080
it's definitely
at its happiest...

08:06.320 --> 08:08.160
...out here.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.800
With a huge 6.6 litre
diesel V8,

08:28.840 --> 08:33.120
the standard Ripsaw is
acknowledged as the fastest
tracked vehicle ever built.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.560
But this particular Ripsaw
is not the standard model.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.560
In a normal state of tune
it's 400 brake horsepower.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.520
This one's been taken up
to 700.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.560
And 975 pounds feet
of torque.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.120
Nearly four tonnes
of off-road tank

08:56.160 --> 08:59.280
travelling at 60mph
perfectly happily.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.480
It is mighty.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.120
An equally surprising
sensation is the ride.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.000
I thought, because
it's tracked, it'll just be
solid and incredibly brutal.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.920
But it has suspension.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.520
More suspension travel
than a Range Rover,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.640
so it's supple.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.240
Suddenly,
it's more gazelle than rhino.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.720
This thing rocks.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.840
And when it comes
to bashing the dunes,

09:32.880 --> 09:36.400
the Ripsaw
is in a league of its own.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.760
A Land Rover Discovery
can climb a gradient
of about 45%.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.480
This thing, 75.

09:45.400 --> 09:46.760
That's damn near vertical.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.600
Boom! Ha-ha!

09:59.760 --> 10:01.640
This is the moment
when, in desert driving:

10:01.680 --> 10:03.360
"Oh, no! What's beyond?
What's beyond?"

10:06.520 --> 10:09.800
But I'm not worried,
cos I'll be fine.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.040
Ha-ha.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.320
Yeah!

10:22.520 --> 10:24.320
I've driven in deserts a lot,

10:24.360 --> 10:26.920
never in something
that just feels this capable.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.800
I mean, camels are good
in the desert, yeah.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.240
But this is better.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

10:46.640 --> 10:49.120
What a device.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.000
I love this thing.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.240
I want one, I want one. Yep!

11:01.280 --> 11:03.440
-I really, really want one.
-I do.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.160
Very nice.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.360
Not bothered about that 1400
horsepower thing, but "that".

11:08.400 --> 11:10.560
Yeah.

11:10.600 --> 11:14.680
I must ask, though, can you
drive a tracked vehicle
on the road in the UK?

11:14.720 --> 11:17.160
-Well, the Army can.
-Apart from the Army.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.160
You're not allowed to drive
a tracked vehicle that's
going to damage the road,

11:19.200 --> 11:21.880
but the Ripsaw's OK because
the tracks are rubber.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.400
And of course, because
they're rubber, if you're
a complete nincompoop

11:24.440 --> 11:27.320
and you crash into
somebody's treasured BMW,

11:27.360 --> 11:29.600
it does less damage...
Did you see that?

11:29.640 --> 11:31.240
Did you know
you had even done that?

11:31.280 --> 11:32.560
No.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.520
It's a tank.
Which is why I love it.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.560
And now it is time
for us to pop into
the post office of chat

11:39.600 --> 11:41.680
on Conversation Street.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.160
Now...

11:50.640 --> 11:52.720
...as this is the start
of a new year,

11:52.760 --> 11:55.080
we thought we'd have a look
at some of the cars we...

11:55.120 --> 11:58.120
we're looking forward
to coming along in 2018.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.520
It's actually quite a car-ry
Conversation Street.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.600
And I want to start with
the Bentley Continental GT,

12:02.640 --> 12:04.640
cos that's been around
for what, 15 years now?

12:04.680 --> 12:06.400
-Yeah, it is.
-15 years.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.840
Anyway, they've restyled it,
given it an all-new look.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.560
Here it is.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.080
RICHARD: Wow, that is
radical, isn't it?

12:12.120 --> 12:15.280
Yes,
all they've changed... What?

12:15.320 --> 12:17.440
Well, it's a good question.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.600
Anyway, on the inside, they
say it has "driver-orientated
instruments".

12:20.640 --> 12:22.280
As opposed to what?

12:22.320 --> 12:23.960
Yeah, no idea.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.640
They say the central command
screen is "retina quality".

12:27.680 --> 12:29.040
I hope it's not
my retina quality.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.440
It'll be sort of slightly
blurry and a bit bloodshot
round the edges.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.120
Actually,
if you defocus my camera

12:35.160 --> 12:37.080
you can see
what it would look like.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.360
-Like that.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.720
Actually, that's better.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.360
Yeah, to be honest,
I wish I had your retina,

12:43.400 --> 12:45.400
-sitting here
looking at you - it's better.
-I do.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.160
So anyway, in short,
this car looks the same
as it did before.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.160
It has a speedometer
you can see

12:51.200 --> 12:53.320
and a satnav screen
that's in focus,

12:53.360 --> 12:56.280
all for Â£150,000.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.960
No, but actually, to be fair,
for a W12 twin-turbo car
like that,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.680
150 grand these days
isn't bad.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.280
And...And I bet that's
a bloody good car.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.520
-I think it probably will be.
-I bet you it is.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.280
I bet that's going to be
bloody good as well.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.440
The only thing I don't like
about Bentley,

13:09.480 --> 13:12.320
I wish they'd stop going on
about all that Bentley boys
at Mulsanne,

13:12.360 --> 13:14.680
and men in aprons
making things.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.120
I've got a bit from their...
from their blurb here.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.720
With your blurry eyes,
here he goes.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.320
Retina quality reading
coming up.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.560
It's really not working,
is it?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.480
Oh, so depressing!

13:24.520 --> 13:26.960
It says,
"Designed, engineered
and handcrafted in Britain".

13:27.000 --> 13:29.440
But the truth is, that's a
Porsche Panamera underneath

13:29.480 --> 13:30.960
and it has a VW engine,

13:31.000 --> 13:32.840
and a Porsche gearbox,
in fact.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.560
No, that's true
but the chief executive
of Bentley is called

13:36.600 --> 13:39.200
-Bunter Potherington-Smythe.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.600
No, he's called
Wolfgang Durheimer.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.600
-Yeah. A bit of a giveaway.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.800
But that's exactly
the sort of thing
they should celebrate.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.680
They should say,
"Bentley. Don't worry,
it's reassuringly German".

13:48.720 --> 13:50.800
Precisely. That's what
you want to hear, actually.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.720
-There's a chance
it might work.

13:54.760 --> 13:59.840
This is the AMG Project One
developed by Lewis Hamilton,

13:59.880 --> 14:03.040
so presumably it will have
pierced door mirrors.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.600
-Yeah.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.640
-And tattooed bodywork.
-Yeah.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.720
And when it gets to where
it's going, the satnav says,

14:09.760 --> 14:11.080
"Hashtag blessed".

14:13.160 --> 14:14.600
Going to cost
two million pounds.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.640
Doesn't say whether
that includes tax.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.520
Cheeky, that is.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.800
-Cruel but fair.
-Ha-ha-ha!

14:27.840 --> 14:31.080
A car I'm looking forward
to driving this year is this.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.440
That is the new BMW 8 Series.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.400
And if it actually
looks like that,

14:35.440 --> 14:37.320
that admittedly
is the styling thing
that they show the public.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.720
But if it looks like that,
I think it will be fantastic.

14:39.760 --> 14:44.480
And I've heard
that it will be available
with a 6.6-litre V12.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.560
-That's a waste of time.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.440
Well, V12s actually
don't make much sense,
if you think about it.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.520
Well, that's a bit of a
sweeping statement, isn't it?

14:51.560 --> 14:54.480
No, seriously, cos you get
all the complexity

14:54.520 --> 14:56.560
and all the thirst
and where's the upside?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.840
Well, for a given capacity
you get a greater number
of smaller pistons

14:58.880 --> 15:00.680
which have a
lower reciprocating rate,

15:00.720 --> 15:02.360
which means you can
have a higher rev line
on the engine,

15:02.400 --> 15:03.880
-and that gets you
more power.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.200
Has a point.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.520
Yeah, the thing is,
though, the power,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.800
the extra power
you talk about,

15:08.840 --> 15:10.880
as a result of whatever
it was you just said,

15:10.920 --> 15:12.200
is offset by the weight.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.920
And they sound dreary,

15:13.960 --> 15:17.400
and all V12s depreciate
like pianos falling off
tower blocks.

15:17.440 --> 15:18.920
No, they do.
Friend of mine, OK?

15:18.960 --> 15:22.400
He had a Ferrari GTC4Lusso,
the V12 one.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.600
Kept it four months
and sold it,

15:24.640 --> 15:25.960
after four months -

15:26.000 --> 15:28.320
and lost Â£55,000.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.720
-Ouch.
-In four months.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.600
Four... Yes! I mean,
if he'd have had the V8,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.920
it wouldn't have
depreciated that much.

15:34.960 --> 15:37.640
Well, mainly because he
wouldn't have wanted to
sell it in the first place.

15:37.680 --> 15:42.000
That is really good buyers'
advice for everyman!
We all now know...

15:42.040 --> 15:45.680
This from a man who's just
reviewed a Â£300,000 tank!

15:47.360 --> 15:49.480
-Has anyone got
an expensive car?
MAN: Yes.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.080
MAN: Range Rover.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.680
That's not expensive.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.520
A Range Rover.
We use those as vans.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.520
What's the most... A what?

15:59.560 --> 16:00.680
SVR.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.000
Oh, an SVR
is quite expensive.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.280
-Yes.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.680
-Do you not feel an idiot
when you overtake?
-No, Hammond, it's got a 1.3!

16:08.880 --> 16:10.600
With that supercharged V8
you feel like such an idiot
when you overtake

16:10.640 --> 16:13.720
cos of the noise it makes.
It's genuinely embarrassing.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.440
I'll admit... OK, let's not talk
about supercars anymore.

16:16.480 --> 16:18.960
Try and think
of something that
isn't about Lamborghinis.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.480
-Well...

16:21.520 --> 16:23.360
It is, as well!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.800
The car I most
like the look of is this:

16:25.840 --> 16:27.720
it's the Lamborghini concept
for...

16:29.840 --> 16:31.400
Actually made me do it.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.560
It's called
the Terzo Millennio.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.520
I don't know if that's how
you pronounce that:
Terzo Millennio.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.840
But thing about that car,
interesting,

16:36.880 --> 16:38.920
it has super capacitors
instead of batteries,

16:38.960 --> 16:42.160
which are apparently better,
and a motor in each wheel.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.120
You can see them, and
they glow when it's running,
which is cool.

16:45.160 --> 16:49.160
But best of all, they say
it has self-healing bodywork.

16:49.200 --> 16:53.040
It's got nanotubes in it,
which can detect damage,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.680
and then repair it.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.520
-I don't know.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.600
No, they said they've been
thinking outside the box
to do it.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.000
I think they've been thinking
inside the pub, haven't they?

17:05.040 --> 17:06.760
With its self-healing...

17:06.800 --> 17:09.000
No, but when that isn't
a drawing any more
and is a real car,

17:09.040 --> 17:12.320
and you went on a motor show
stand and ran a key
down the side of it,

17:12.360 --> 17:15.760
I bet they wouldn't say,
"Well, that's good, now we
can watch it mend itself."

17:15.800 --> 17:18.000
No, they might charge
after you, bellowing,

17:18.040 --> 17:19.760
"I hope you've got nanotubes,
chum. You're going to get
a kicking."

17:21.640 --> 17:23.320
Things I'm excited about,
it's actually out about now.

17:23.360 --> 17:25.280
Renault have a pickup truck.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.480
-Look at that!

17:26.520 --> 17:28.200
-Yeah.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.840
Because the whole world wants
one. Je suis un rouge neck.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.760
-Je suis un nerd-kicker.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.920
I'm sorry to say
that won't work,

17:37.960 --> 17:40.680
cos the Americans don't want
a Renault and the French
don't want a pickup truck.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.680
ISIS like a pickup truck,
don't they?

17:42.720 --> 17:45.560
-ISIS would...

17:45.600 --> 17:47.480
-I'm just looking
for a market.
-It's a good idea.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.560
This is business,
that's what you do.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.440
-No, if Renault ship
them all out to Syria...

17:52.480 --> 17:53.840
"Oh, these crappy old
Toyotas".

17:53.880 --> 17:56.200
Shiny new Renault -
it won't start.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.000
It would solve ISIS
in a heartbeat.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.600
Global peace.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.320
"The drone's coming!"

18:01.360 --> 18:02.920
They'll be blown to pieces.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.840
Thank you, Renault.
Well done, saved the world.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.000
Renault has saved the world.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.240
-Yeah.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.840
I tell you what I thought
you'd like most of all for
this year, is this.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.520
I do like the look of that.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.000
That is the new... It's the
Dodge Challenger Demon.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.240
It's basically an even
more powerful version
of the Hellcat

18:17.280 --> 18:20.600
I drove in the last series.
840 horsepower.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.400
And it's got those
little wheels at the front

18:22.440 --> 18:24.760
because it's set up there
for drag racing.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.520
-But it looks like a T-Rex.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.480
It's ridic... It's like that.
It's just stupid.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.200
That's why T-Rexs died out,
they couldn't reach anything.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.840
Well, they were good at drag
racing though, weren't they?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.600
But they...they couldn't
even pleasure themselves.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.000
Well, how would
a T

18:42.040 --> 18:44.240
How has your mind
even gone there?

18:44.280 --> 18:46.040
I'm telling you--

18:46.080 --> 18:47.680
-Is that why they were
always in such a bad mood?
-Yes.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.040
And that is the end
of Conversation Street.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.640
Thank you very much.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.080
Excellent, excellent.
Now...

19:01.120 --> 19:04.440
Moving on,
I would like to talk a little
about hot hatchbacks,

19:04.480 --> 19:06.840
because I think they
might be getting a bit silly.

19:06.880 --> 19:12.200
The AMG Mercedes A Class
develops 375 horsepower.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.640
The Focus RS
has 345 horsepower.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.760
Why do you need that
much power in a hatchback?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.760
-Well, James--
-Well, nothing.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.840
Because I think it's time we
all just calmed down a bit.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.480
This is the Golf GTI,

19:32.520 --> 19:35.200
and it's a
perfect illustration
of what I'm on about.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.200
Yes, it is quick.
And it should be quick.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.320
It's got more power
than a 1980s Ferrari.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.040
But then again, it needs
a lot of power because
it's so big and so heavy.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.400
The hot hatch
wasn't always like this.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.480
To show you what I mean,

19:58.520 --> 20:02.480
here's the original Golf GTI
from 42 years ago.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.960
And it's a very different
animal indeed.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.560
Now that car wasn't
about massive rear leg room

20:09.600 --> 20:10.840
or a big bulky body,

20:10.880 --> 20:13.640
or a huge duvet
of sound deadening,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.480
or all this equipment,
or any of that stuff.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.120
It was just about
having a bit of a laugh,

20:18.160 --> 20:20.880
darting around in
a biscuit-tin body of a car.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.720
Sadly they don't
make 'em like that any more.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.200
Well, except when they do.

20:31.160 --> 20:36.160
This is the Volkswagen up! -
the smallest car VW sells.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.560
And now
they've made a GTI version.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.320
A car that's been created

20:41.360 --> 20:45.160
to resurrect the spirit
of that original Mark I Golf.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.880
In fact, the similarities
are uncanny.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.480
Let's start with horsepower.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.080
The original had just 108,

21:00.120 --> 21:04.720
and the up! GTI
has a similarly modest 113,

21:04.760 --> 21:07.400
giving both cars a 0-60 time

21:07.440 --> 21:10.720
of around nine seconds.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.080
It's also a little bit
'80s retro in here.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.280
For a start, you
start it by turning a key.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.240
There's no button to press
for people who want to
pretend to be fighter pilots.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.480
You change gear using a stick

21:21.520 --> 21:23.760
and an old-fashioned
clutch pedal.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.320
I haven't looked in the boot

21:25.360 --> 21:26.760
but I expect there's a
miners' strike in there,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.640
or the speeches
of Margaret Thatcher.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.880
However, one of
the reasons the Mark I GTI
was so much fun to drive

21:39.920 --> 21:41.720
was because it was so light.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.840
But the up!,
being a modern car,

21:44.880 --> 21:47.800
weighs a portly 200kg more.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.520
So, with all that extra
weight to lug around,

21:52.560 --> 21:55.800
is the new boy actually
any fun on the move?

22:02.720 --> 22:06.800
Well, its modernity
does pay under the bonnet.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.680
This has just
a one-litre engine

22:08.720 --> 22:10.360
with only three cylinders,

22:10.400 --> 22:12.920
but it does have
a turbo-charger

22:12.960 --> 22:14.480
for a bit of extra oomph.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.760
And it makes
a fantastic growly noise.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.880
Listen to this.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.040
You don't get that
in a modern Golf GTI.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.240
It's all smooth and asinine.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.680
Now, that noise...
There it is, there.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.560
It's a bit of a cheat
because there's something
called a sound actuator

22:34.600 --> 22:36.160
under the bonnet,

22:36.200 --> 22:39.200
and it artificially pumps
that growl into the cabin.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.520
But so what?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.600
It's very satisfying.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.120
So, the engine's
a bit of a hoot.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.560
And, despite
the extra weight,

22:48.600 --> 22:51.160
the up!'s pretty nimble
through corners too.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.280
Yeah, you see, small...

23:00.600 --> 23:02.400
...chuckable...

23:03.880 --> 23:05.720
...enjoyable.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.360
It is proper fun.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.200
Feels like I'm doing
hundreds of miles an hour.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.800
You know what this is like?
It's a bit like an '80s
action movie

23:19.840 --> 23:22.160
where the same thing
blows up ten times.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.800
And it's that compared
with say, a CGI blockbuster

23:32.840 --> 23:33.960
full of amazing effects.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.840
One is a simple laugh,

23:35.880 --> 23:37.880
the other is
a bit too bloated

23:37.920 --> 23:41.640
and, frankly,
up its own arse.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.000
But even though the up!
harks back to simpler times,

23:45.040 --> 23:48.320
it still comes
with climate control,

23:48.360 --> 23:49.800
heated seats,

23:49.840 --> 23:52.360
Bluetooth, a reversing camera

23:52.400 --> 23:55.080
and, for when your
17-year-old borrows it,

23:55.120 --> 23:57.920
traction control
that you can't turn off.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.320
So it's quicker
than it sounds.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.400
It scampers around
like a spaniel,

24:06.440 --> 24:09.080
and it's got just enough kick
to make it comfortable.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.440
But no more than that.

24:11.480 --> 24:16.040
And it gives you all this
for about Â£14,000.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.760
Or, to put it another way,

24:17.800 --> 24:20.920
it's half the price
of a new Golf GTI,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.880
and, I honestly believe,
twice the fun.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.120
I might actually want one.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.200
Nice little car.
Nice little car.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.440
-It is.
-So...

24:41.000 --> 24:42.560
So that is...
that is interesting.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.120
What you're saying is

24:44.160 --> 24:47.920
the up! GTI is half the price
of a modern Golf GTI

24:47.960 --> 24:50.280
and more fun.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.480
Yeah, and cheaper to run.
And actually, to be honest,
it's more characterful.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.120
So really the conclusion is

24:54.160 --> 24:57.480
that to own a Golf GTI,
you'd have to be a moron.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.640
To be honest,
you'd have to be demented.

25:00.680 --> 25:04.640
Shall we see how fast the up!
goes round the Eboladrome?

25:04.680 --> 25:07.520
Oh, wait. You own a Golf GTI,
don't you?

25:07.560 --> 25:08.880
Yes, I do.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.120
I knew somebody had one.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.760
It's when you said a moron,
that's when it all
clicked into place.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.960
Anyway, the lap.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.400
Right, let's see
what you've got.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.240
JEREMY: And she's off.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.920
A murky day out there,

25:22.960 --> 25:25.480
and I'm sure
she'd rather be in a Golf.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.360
Onto the Isn't Straight.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.040
Actual standing water
out there,

25:30.080 --> 25:32.880
but she's showing
no fear at all.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.440
Smooth line through there.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.600
Now trundling down
towards Your Name Here.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.280
A Golf, of course,
would have arrived hours ago.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.640
She still isn't there!
Come on!

25:43.680 --> 25:48.320
The little
up-exclamation-mark GTI
dawdling through there.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.760
Golf GTI has a clever diff,
of course. This doesn't.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.680
And now back onto the Isn't.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.320
Perfect line along there...

25:56.360 --> 25:58.200
And down the gears now
for Old Lady's House.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.640
Well, not yet but in a minute
she will be. Hang on.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.880
Any minute now...

26:01.920 --> 26:04.240
There she is,
down through the gears.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.520
Will it understeer
through here?

26:07.560 --> 26:10.280
No, cos of course you can't
turn off the traction control

26:10.320 --> 26:11.960
whereas you can in a Golf GTI

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
cos it's a car for
brave and brilliant people.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.880
Right, down the Bumpy Back
Straight to Substation.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.720
It really is awful weather
out there.

26:20.760 --> 26:23.240
If she was in a Golf,
it'd be sunny.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.120
Uh...right, just the last
corner to crawl round.

26:26.160 --> 26:28.520
There it is,
and across the line.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.040
Right, let's find out

26:36.080 --> 26:38.440
where it goes on the board,
shall we?

26:38.480 --> 26:40.440
Let's have a look.

26:40.480 --> 26:41.800
-Ha!

26:41.840 --> 26:44.840
Literally
the slowest car in the world.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.280
Yeah, but it was
chucking it down. Come on.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.960
So you're saying
if it had been dry

26:49.000 --> 26:50.600
it would have challenged
the Aston Martin Vulcan?

26:50.640 --> 26:53.880
-Yes, it would.
-Anyway, we must move it on

26:53.920 --> 26:57.120
because it is time to play
Celebrity Face Off.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.720
Thank you.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.920
And once again we are
asking an important question,

27:12.960 --> 27:14.240
and it's this.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.840
Who is the fastest person
in the world

27:15.880 --> 27:19.960
who has a failed
former career in a band?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.600
Well, to help us find out,
please welcome...

27:22.640 --> 27:24.560
Dominic Cooper
and Bill Bailey!

27:27.960 --> 27:30.120
Thank you very much.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.720
Twins!

27:31.760 --> 27:33.480
They're literally twins.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.720
-Hello.
-Welcome.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.680
-Cheers, thank you.
-Have a seat.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.080
-Welcome, gentlemen.
-Thank you.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.400
Welcome, welcome.
I have to tell you,

27:44.440 --> 27:46.000
I had a great one
last night, Dominic.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.480
I actually met you in
a restaurant just last night.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.920
No, no.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.480
Exactly,
that was the problem.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.800
I was with a couple of
theatrical and film people.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.560
I said you were coming on
the show, and they went,
"He's on the next table."

27:56.600 --> 27:58.720
So I went over and
actually said to this person,

27:58.760 --> 28:00.120
"I hear you're coming
on the show."

28:00.160 --> 28:01.600
He went,
"What are you talking about?"

28:03.160 --> 28:04.800
You went over
to someone that wasn't me,

28:04.840 --> 28:07.160
persuaded by the people
you were with that it was me.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.120
-Yes but it was incredible--

28:09.160 --> 28:11.520
He was a complete stranger.
He thinks Jeremy Clarkson--

28:11.560 --> 28:13.400
Perhaps it was Danny Dyer.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.560
-No.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.920
No, no, no, no, no.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.560
That is not fair.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.440
So I made a bit of a fool
of myself. Anyway, right...

28:19.480 --> 28:21.400
Well, thank goodness you
hadn't done that before.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.360
It's a new experience.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.680
-Phew.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.080
That was a lucky escape.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.040
Oh, dear.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.960
Anyway, the link,
of course, between you two

28:33.000 --> 28:35.560
is that you both had failed
careers in bands early on.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.800
-Yes.
-I wouldn't say failed.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.640
I don't... Fail, really?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.760
-Well...
-Interesting, uh...

28:41.800 --> 28:43.240
What's success,
in terms of a band?

28:43.280 --> 28:45.400
Well, OK, I think,
were you not once,

28:45.440 --> 28:47.680
the band
outnumbered the audience?

28:47.720 --> 28:49.320
-Every time we played.
-That's a failure.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.400
It is,
I'd call that a failure.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.280
Well, there was one
particular gig in Greenwich

28:54.320 --> 28:55.880
where, yeah, there
was one audience member.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.480
-Five band members,

28:57.520 --> 28:59.200
-one audience member, yeah.
-Oh, that's tricky.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.520
You...
before you start with the...

29:02.560 --> 29:03.960
What was your band called?

29:04.000 --> 29:06.800
Well, the band
was called the Famous Five

29:06.840 --> 29:09.040
and there was
actually four people in it.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.320
-And nobody had heard of us,

29:11.360 --> 29:13.760
so it sort of
didn't make any sense.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.440
We...
We did have a photo shoot

29:17.480 --> 29:19.480
and the drummer
was quite a vain man,

29:19.520 --> 29:22.840
and he decided what a
great idea it would be to...

29:22.880 --> 29:26.960
if we all painted
our little fingers
with black nail varnish,

29:27.000 --> 29:28.960
because that looked cool,
right?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.720
Then we saw the photo shoot

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
and it looks like we've all
trapped our hand in a door.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.720
-Just looks really stupid.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.600
Now, I've got a question
from Richard Hammond...
cos I was in a band.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.400
We were talking
about this the other day.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.320
James May was in a band,
He was in a band.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.320
He still wears socks down
the front of his underpants
to do the show.

29:43.360 --> 29:45.400
RICHARD: Whoa! What?

29:45.440 --> 29:47.680
He was wondering,
did you ever put anything
down the front of your--

29:47.720 --> 29:49.640
I did not ask that!

29:49.680 --> 29:52.560
You did! You said, "Can you
ask them what they put..."

29:52.600 --> 29:54.000
You've written
that down yourself!

29:54.040 --> 29:55.840
Well, I may have
made it up a bit.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.440
But you never went down
that route?

29:57.480 --> 29:58.760
-Yeah.
-No.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.480
-No. No, no, no, never.
Did you?

30:00.520 --> 30:03.360
Well, very recently, cos I
had to wear a lot of spandex

30:03.400 --> 30:05.120
in the thing I'm filming
at the moment,

30:05.160 --> 30:07.560
all-in-one spandex...
sort of...

30:07.600 --> 30:09.880
-This is Mamma Mia 2.
-'70s ABBA suit, yeah.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.960
So we were all discussing,
it was quite a logistical
and quite problematic thing.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.880
It makes you look like
you have absolutely

30:14.920 --> 30:17.160
very little going on
in that department.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.640
So we had to decide whether,
and what we would use to...

30:20.680 --> 30:22.200
-Right.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.000
What did you put down
the front of your trousers?

30:24.040 --> 30:25.520
This is what Hammond
was asking.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.520
RICHARD: I wasn't asking,
just to be clear.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.400
I tried two make-up
sponges at first.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.960
-Two make-up...

30:34.000 --> 30:36.120
Anyway, listen,
we've got to get on to cars.

30:36.160 --> 30:39.240
-You're united, I think,
by a love of French cars.
-Yes.

30:39.280 --> 30:40.880
-Cos you have a Citroen DS.
-I do.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.880
-Beautiful.
-Which is beautiful.

30:42.920 --> 30:45.080
-Stunning car.
-It's the most
beautiful car ever made.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.440
-There...
-I agree.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.080
And...it's a piece of work.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.960
And why did you
buy such a thing?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.240
Why?

30:51.280 --> 30:54.040
Well, because
of the Icelandic volcano

30:54.080 --> 30:56.400
with the unpronounceable
name,

30:56.440 --> 30:58.440
-Eyjally-jolly-joffakabl...

30:58.480 --> 31:01.200
...when it erupted and there
was the big ash cloud,
we were trapped.

31:01.240 --> 31:03.920
We were in southern Spain,
couldn't get home.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.160
All the flights
were cancelled.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.800
The ferries were full.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.960
We thought we'd get
the train back through France

31:09.000 --> 31:11.440
but, of course, perfectly,

31:11.480 --> 31:13.320
the French decided
to have a rail strike

31:13.360 --> 31:18.440
during the time of the
greatest travel upheaval
in recent memory.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.360
"Non, I don't care.
I don't care about you."

31:21.600 --> 31:24.240
But there's no flights.
"Non...uh."

31:24.280 --> 31:25.560
So we...

31:26.840 --> 31:29.720
I just... Just checking
my blood pressure.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.040
-So... So what happened
was we thought:

31:33.080 --> 31:36.320
let's just buy a car
and drive home in it.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.600
And then I thought: well,
let's not just buy any car,

31:39.640 --> 31:41.800
let's buy the car
I've always wanted to own.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.440
So we found a little garage
just outside Marseille

31:44.480 --> 31:47.760
and it was wrecks
of every kind of French car
you could imagine,

31:47.800 --> 31:50.480
but amongst them
was this old black DS

31:50.520 --> 31:52.760
and it was a
bit of a wreck, but it went.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.880
-And it got you home.
-It got us home.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.320
And then,
over the last few years,

31:57.360 --> 31:59.760
I've refurbed it
into its former glory.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.280
-Do you still
drive it around today?
-I still drive it around today.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.680
Now, you started
on this Citroen thing.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.400
Did you learn to drive
in a 2CV?

32:06.440 --> 32:08.480
Yes, I did, in a field.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.040
The thing about the 2CV is
if you learn in one of those,

32:11.080 --> 32:13.880
and I've often wondered that,
when you get into
an actual proper car...

32:15.880 --> 32:18.200
don't you think:
well, I don't know
what anything does.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.800
Cos the gear lever's all
in a different place and
everything feels different.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.080
Yeah, the gear's
all backwards isn't it?

32:22.120 --> 32:24.480
And it didn't help that
my stepdad at the time
put the engine in backwards

32:24.520 --> 32:26.640
so it had four reverse gears
and one forward.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.360
That's what he did
at that particular point.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.600
But they're so simple.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.720
And the fan.
They had those fan...

32:31.760 --> 32:34.480
They... just had a fan,
you just opened...
just a hole into the...

32:34.520 --> 32:36.600
I loved the basic nature
of it, you know?

32:36.640 --> 32:40.120
You could open it with
just a screwdriver, a coin.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.200
I had a...
I had a Citroen Dyane,

32:42.240 --> 32:45.560
which, if you can believe it,
is the more basic version
of the 2CV.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.440
And I left it
parked up somewhere
and I forgot my key.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.840
And I thought: nah,
don't worry, I can break in.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.640
So I broke into my own car
and I got into the back seat

32:54.680 --> 32:56.200
and there was
a child seat there,

32:56.240 --> 32:58.440
and I thought:
I don't have a child. Oh, no.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.040
-Oh, dear.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.320
And uh...

33:04.360 --> 33:06.120
But it's very easy to put
back together again,
you know.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.000
-For when the real owner
comes back.
-Yes.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.480
Cos your first car,
not French, was that...

33:10.520 --> 33:11.640
-No.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.600
Austin Healey Sprite, yeah.

33:13.640 --> 33:15.640
Oh, a Sprite, right,
not a big Healey.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.280
Not a 3000. It's tiny.
I don't know how
I dared drive it.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.760
Actually, it was my
brother's,

33:19.800 --> 33:22.200
and I needed to get
to Stratford to do a play

33:22.240 --> 33:25.960
and I don't know why
or how I had the nerve.
I wasn't insured.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.840
The car had a hole about that
high above the petrol tank

33:28.880 --> 33:31.880
so you could put 55p's worth
of petrol in it, which would
get you there.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.760
-Had no wipers -
wipers on strings.
-Like an Uber driver.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.520
And one headlight.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.720
So what are you running now?

33:39.760 --> 33:42.840
The Healey:
the Healey around London
and an Audi RS7.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.400
Hang on, so you
still have the Healey, and...

33:45.440 --> 33:46.840
Yeah, I got another one.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.280
From eBay.
It works quite well.

33:48.320 --> 33:50.480
-Yeah.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.520
It's the only thing
that's ever turned up,
that I bought on eBay.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.160
-And yeah, it's quite good.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.800
Because it's interesting,
you both drive old cars,
and why would you?

33:58.840 --> 34:00.720
Because you are
quite a speedy driver.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.200
Oh, well, I like the speed.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.920
I like to go fast.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.600
How many points did you get
on your licence at one point?

34:06.640 --> 34:08.440
Uh... Well, all of them.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.680
You know, I had 12 points

34:10.720 --> 34:12.760
and then I went over
the 12 points

34:12.800 --> 34:14.840
and I had to go on
a speed awareness course,

34:14.880 --> 34:16.760
and I've done that
three times now.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.560
So I'm quite used to that.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.080
-Yes.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.440
I was driving down to Devon

34:23.480 --> 34:25.160
and I forgot
to put my seatbelt.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.080
My bad, terrible thing to do.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.400
I'd just pulled out
of the service station,
I hadn't had it on.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.200
I was in the process of
putting it on.

34:31.240 --> 34:35.320
And anyway, so I got pulled
over and the copper,

34:35.360 --> 34:38.400
he said,
"Right", he goes, "Now."
He was from up north.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.240
He goes, "Very dangerous,
what you did there."
I went, "Oh, yeah."

34:41.280 --> 34:43.040
He said, "You know
the band Def Leppard?"

34:43.080 --> 34:45.200
And I said, "Yeah,
I know the band Def Leppard".

34:45.240 --> 34:48.120
He goes ,
"Yeah. You know the drummer?

34:48.160 --> 34:50.480
You know, lost his arm?
He wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.640
He was thrown from
the vehicle, lost his arm."

34:52.680 --> 34:54.360
And I went, "Oh, right."

34:54.400 --> 34:56.640
And he goes, "His girlfriend,
she was wearing a seatbelt.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.200
Killed instantly."

35:02.840 --> 35:04.640
What was his point?

35:04.680 --> 35:08.200
I don't know. It didn't back
up his story at all, did it?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.520
Right, so anyway.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.480
You came here, you did
all this, and...was it fun?

35:14.520 --> 35:16.160
It was great fun,
on the track.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.600
I just loved it, loved
every second of it, yeah.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.960
Trying to work out
whose lap shall we see first.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.360
-We'll go... You're nearest.
-All right.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.960
Shall we have
a look at Bill's lap?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.760
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Yeah.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.400
-Let's see it.
-I'm very worried
about this.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.840
JEREMY:
And away we go. It's looking
good today, the Jag.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.440
-It is.
-Ha-ha.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.640
Lovely lady of acceleration.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.720
JEREMY:
Few helmet issues there,
if I may be so bold.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.080
-BILL: I know.
-JEREMY: Jimmy Carr once--

35:42.120 --> 35:44.000
BILL:
Looks like
I've been punched...

35:44.040 --> 35:46.560
JEREMY: A fat kid
stuck in a lift.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.800
That's a bit steady through
there, but I agree with that,

35:48.840 --> 35:50.840
because otherwise
it's a bit tricky when
you get onto the gravel.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.800
BILL: Yes.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.480
JEREMY:
Holding it nicely together...
into Difficult Bit One.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.880
BILL: Tricky bit there,
that was pretty good.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.840
DOMINIC:
You're so good at this!

35:57.880 --> 36:00.480
Oh, horrible gravel,
horrible gravel.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.920
Horrible gravel.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.640
JEREMY:
In to the gravel.
Holding it nicely through.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.520
-That's very well done,
got to be honest, Bill.
-BILL: Not too bad.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.240
JEREMY:
No, right, now
into Difficult Bit Two.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.960
BILL:
This is tricky,
this is tricky.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.760
JEREMY:
Oh, you're in the
thick gravel now, that's...

36:13.800 --> 36:15.640
I was in the horrible,
nasty thick stuff there.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.240
JEREMY: Slow you down.
Now, coming back on the
track, very slippery here.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.560
BILL: That's very slippery.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.640
-BILL: Suddenly the...
-JEREMY: Oh!

36:20.680 --> 36:22.600
BILL: Suddenly you just...
There's a bit of fishtailing
because...

36:22.640 --> 36:25.120
-JEREMY: That's all right.
-BILL: ...you're back on
the tarmac.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.160
JEREMY:
Right, now we're
into the very fast bit now.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.280
Very exciting.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.800
JEREMY:
There's a man
who likes a bit of speed.

36:35.840 --> 36:38.160
And... Oh, it's a couple
of lines chosen for there.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
And another one there.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.040
Coming up to
the final corner.
Little bit of understeer,

36:43.080 --> 36:45.200
but not like Casey the
Bear Man had the other day.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.840
And there we are,
across the line, everybody.

36:46.880 --> 36:50.880
-Well done.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.920
-Well done.
-I'm furious, furious.

36:55.320 --> 36:56.880
Looked good.

36:56.920 --> 37:00.000
That did look good.
Now, Dominic, um...

37:00.040 --> 37:02.080
You had a bit
of a problem with...

37:02.120 --> 37:04.280
-Well, with one of
your practice laps.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.720
Would anybody like to see?

37:06.760 --> 37:08.440
AUDIENCE: Yes!

37:08.480 --> 37:10.320
-This bit.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.240
Here he comes.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.760
And onto the slippery bit.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.400
Oh, oopsy-daisy.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.720
DOMINIC: Yes, yes, yes.
Straight back on the track!

37:17.760 --> 37:22.080
JEREMY: This is what I love,
keeping it going, yes!

37:24.600 --> 37:27.720
That was very good.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.920
Yeah. It was a bad moment.
That was a bad moment.

37:30.960 --> 37:33.000
Eventually,
you got a lap put together.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.720
ALL: Yes!

37:34.760 --> 37:36.640
-Here we go.
-It's just not
going to be as good.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.520
It always seems to take
a while getting off the line.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.720
I'm going to have to break
quite hard into this corner.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.040
-Aargh!

37:47.080 --> 37:50.440
OK, now you've got to...
Hang on, let's listen.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.680
Oh, feathering the throttle
through there.
That's nicely done.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.680
Holding it as we head
toward the gravel.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.520
Yeah, you can see it
starting to fishtail.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.200
That is slightly
bowel-loosening
when it does that.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.440
DOMINIC: Yep.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.640
Very wide through there,
through the...
It looks like it's manure.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.840
Come on, car!

38:08.880 --> 38:11.640
-DOMINIC: Blaming the car.
-JEREMY: Cars respond
when you shout at them.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.200
It's what people don't
understand, but they do.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.720
DOMINIC:
It's such good fun,
that gravel bit.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.080
JEREMY:
That's tidy through there.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.120
-JEREMY: Right,
Difficult Bit Two.
-BILL: Tidy.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.920
JEREMY:
Sometimes tidy is fast.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.320
Sometimes it isn't,
I admit, but it is...
could be.

38:24.360 --> 38:28.200
More fishtailing there.
You've got to try and get it
right for this.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.880
Can you do it properly this
time? Yeah, look at that!

38:30.920 --> 38:32.920
DOMINIC: Now, this is
the corner, this is the one.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.680
JEREMY: It's greasy.
Was it very slippery?

38:34.720 --> 38:36.640
DOMINIC: It's hard coming out
of the gravel onto the tarmac.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.760
Be confident!
Keep going, keep going!

38:39.800 --> 38:41.000
JEREMY: It is exciting
because you're supposed--

38:41.040 --> 38:43.560
DOMINIC:
As though I'm going to stop.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.640
JEREMY: It's just... Ooh,
there's another one... Ooh,
shall I turn? Ooh, maybe not.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.960
There we go, coming up now
to the last corner.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.960
You can lose so much time
here, but I don't think you
are doing there.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.640
And there we are,
across the line, everyone.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.400
-Well done.
-Thank you.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.640
-That is such fun.
-Oh, the best.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.120
I've got the times here.

39:04.160 --> 39:05.760
Oh-ho-ho...

39:05.800 --> 39:07.360
-Bill Bailey.
-Yes.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.880
-It's a 1.25.1 is what it is.
-All right, then.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.360
-Now, it's a good time.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.280
A greasy track out there.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.680
-It was wet. It was wet.
-Greasy.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.600
Yeah, no question. That's
a greasy track out there,
and that's pretty good.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.440
-Times we've been having,
that's ballpark.
-OK.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.560
They've been in the dry
so you can be proud.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.000
Dominic Cooper.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.720
One...

39:28.760 --> 39:30.760
twenty...

39:30.800 --> 39:32.440
-3.6.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.920
BILL: Well done.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.600
-Congratulations.
-I thought I'd failed!

39:38.160 --> 39:40.120
So there we are,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.040
let's get this right,
shall we?

39:42.080 --> 39:45.800
It's Bill Bailey and the
fastest person with a beard

39:45.840 --> 39:48.240
who went on into
either stand-up or acting

39:48.280 --> 39:50.120
with a failed
early career in a band,

39:50.160 --> 39:51.960
-Dominic Cooper!
-Yay.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.320
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Very good.

39:56.360 --> 39:59.480
Now, if you go
on the Internet,

39:59.520 --> 40:03.240
there's lots of films
on there with people
skidding around in cars.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.200
I've got an example here
of what I'm on about.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.120
Yes, yes.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.920
I know what you're thinking.

40:41.960 --> 40:45.280
You're thinking:
Oh, that's very impressive.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.520
You're thinking that's
very impressive, but is it?

40:47.560 --> 40:49.560
Well, yes, it is.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.080
That's the thing.
I don't think it is.
Anyone could do it.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.440
-Well, no they couldn't.
-They could, seriously.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.200
Because every time
you make a mistake

40:56.240 --> 40:58.680
you cut to a shot of the rev
counter, or changing gear.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.120
Yeah? Or your face
looking a bit heroic,

41:01.160 --> 41:02.920
and then you get back
to the action again.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.400
It's just editing.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.080
I think it's a bit more
complicated than that.

41:06.120 --> 41:08.680
No, it isn't, honestly. And
I decided to prove my point

41:08.720 --> 41:12.480
by making a skidding-about
film of my own, OK?

41:14.840 --> 41:17.200
You just need a pretentious
opening with some smoke

41:17.240 --> 41:20.080
and then lots of shots of me
looking heroic like that.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.880
-So I look heroic, like that.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.840
-Well, you don't.
-I do, and I will.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.200
-This will be good.
-It is.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.080
-I bet it isn't.
-It is.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.720
Why have you stopped it?
Why did you stop it?

45:00.760 --> 45:03.240
Because...
Because it's rubbish.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.160
It isn't rubbish. The ladies
and gentlemen were enjoying
it. Were you enjoying that?

45:06.200 --> 45:08.200
ALL: Yes!
-Exactly.
Why did you stop it?

45:08.240 --> 45:10.600
Because
the whole thing is fake.

45:10.640 --> 45:12.680
What was faked in that?

45:12.720 --> 45:14.520
All right, take that
rev counter shot for a start.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.080
Pull it up,
let's have a look.

45:16.120 --> 45:20.840
OK, so you are doing 6750rpm
and no miles an hour.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.440
Speedometer was broken.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.560
-Yes, it was.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.000
What about that bit where
your feet were dancing
around on the pedals?

45:28.040 --> 45:29.840
-You know, that bit.
-Skilful work.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.880
-Yeah, it was.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.120
Would anybody like
to see the unedited footage
of how he did that?

45:34.160 --> 45:36.200
ALL: Yes!
-Yes we would, we would yes.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.400
-Yeah.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.760
So I can get my feet
wiggling around on the pedals
and we can cut that in?

45:41.800 --> 45:43.640
-Yeah.
-Good.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.520
Heel and toe, heel and toe...

45:49.080 --> 45:51.760
Shall we wobble
the car a bit as well?

45:51.800 --> 45:54.400
Yeah, rock it.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.720
And then drop these in
just every so often.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.440
Yeah.

45:58.480 --> 46:00.640
Do the gear change as well.
We can paint the windows out.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.880
Do we need to get
a rev counter shot, Phil?

46:06.920 --> 46:09.840
We'll just... We'll just
stick a camera on here.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.160
-Like that, on there.
-OK.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.640
We can use that one
from the footwell.

46:12.680 --> 46:13.600
Yeah.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.680
Got it?

46:24.720 --> 46:26.400
Totally convincing.
I'm keeping it so that it
looks like it's in gear,

46:26.440 --> 46:28.120
you know,
not just revving it:

46:29.760 --> 46:31.440
JEREMY: No, wait.

46:34.200 --> 46:35.960
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.160
And then...
Then there was that bit

46:39.200 --> 46:41.480
where you were doughnuting
around in the barn,
remember that?

46:42.920 --> 46:45.440
Who would like to see
the rushes of that one?

46:45.480 --> 46:49.000
-Let's see what was
on the cutting room floor.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.920
What scene's this,
scene four?

46:50.960 --> 46:53.400
Scenes two to seven in-car.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.680
So I just look heroic.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.600
Yeah, but you've really got
to throw it in and give it
a bit of oppo, yeah?

46:58.640 --> 47:01.320
Yeah. I can do that.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.920
20 years of practice.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.240
Farmkana, the introduction.
Take one.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.800
Handbrake!

47:18.760 --> 47:20.600
Had an accident.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.400
Damn.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.280
-Oh, shit.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.920
-Yeah.

47:44.960 --> 47:46.880
-I look pretty good.
-Nice one.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.840
It...it didn't, it didn't
look good though, did it?

47:56.880 --> 47:58.080
No, and on that terrible
disappointment--

47:58.120 --> 48:00.120
No, no, no. No.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.720
-No, no, no.
-We haven't got time for
any more of your nonsense.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.480
Oh, yes, we have, cos we
haven't got to that bit yet

48:05.520 --> 48:07.480
where you slid through
the gate, remember?

48:07.520 --> 48:09.080
-Oh, for God's sake!
-Who wants to see
what happened there?

48:09.120 --> 48:11.640
-Nobody does!
-The truth.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.520
Speed.

48:13.560 --> 48:15.680
Farmkana: The Gate.
Take one.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.160
Let's do this!

48:24.560 --> 48:25.840
Oh, shit.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.720
I may have clipped
something there.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.920
Damn. Sorry about that, Phil.

48:31.960 --> 48:34.240
Well, from now on we just...

48:34.280 --> 48:36.120
Why can't we shoot everything
from the other side?

48:36.160 --> 48:38.480
I can't do that cos the car's
turning around all the time.

48:38.520 --> 48:41.040
I can't just film from one
side. It's going to look
absolutely terrible.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.960
But if you...
You can barely see that.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.640
Well, you can, look, it's...

48:44.680 --> 48:46.680
Why don't we just
mend the fence and
have another go at it?

48:49.240 --> 48:50.960
The Gate. Take two.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.920
Concentrating, concentrating.

48:54.960 --> 48:57.200
And turn, and flick!

48:57.240 --> 48:58.640
Oh, dearie me.

48:58.680 --> 49:02.360
He's done it again.
What a massive twat.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.800
-You just can't do it.
-I can.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.480
-You can't.
-Well, I clipped it once.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.040
I'm getting better.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.520
It's still not going through
smoothly, is it?

49:08.560 --> 49:11.240
Could you just rebuild it
once more, honestly?

49:13.840 --> 49:16.720
I think I know
what the problem is.
My angle's too shallow.

49:16.760 --> 49:19.920
So I'm going to come up
this side of the bog
and swing it round.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.920
The Gate. Take three.

49:21.960 --> 49:24.280
PHIL: Action
when you're ready.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.760
Turn...yank, let go, power.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.760
PHIL: Action
when you're ready.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.640
Right, here we go.

49:34.360 --> 49:36.400
And handbrake! Oh, shit, that's
the bloody...

49:40.360 --> 49:43.040
What happened was...
You won't believe this,

49:43.080 --> 49:45.320
but I went for the handbrake,

49:45.360 --> 49:48.080
but I changed
into second by mistake.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.760
-Properly wedged it in there.
-Yeah.

49:50.800 --> 49:53.360
Well, at least we don't have
to reset the gatepost again.

49:53.400 --> 49:57.000
Exactly. There,
you see. That's the sort
of bright thinking I like.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.000
That's not a good thing,
though.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.480
-Cos that's worse.

50:00.520 --> 50:02.520
Phil, let's get the other guy
in the car.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.400
Can somebody get Mark?

50:08.440 --> 50:10.080
-Oh, don't show this.
-I should explain.

50:10.120 --> 50:13.080
That is three-times British
Rally Champion Mark Higgins.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.400
If you just drive through
there about...

50:17.440 --> 50:19.800
-I was doing about 85, 90.
-Right.

50:19.840 --> 50:21.400
And I wasn't
quite getting it.

50:21.440 --> 50:24.160
So if you could just come
through there, sideways,

50:24.200 --> 50:26.520
power up and power out.

50:26.560 --> 50:29.520
Right.

50:29.560 --> 50:31.080
Thing is,
you'll have to wear that.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.720
It's me - it's what
they use in Hollywood.

50:32.760 --> 50:34.320
Yeah, but how
can I see through them?

50:34.360 --> 50:36.120
Yes, you do.
Just look through the slits.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.000
Put it on, seriously,
it works.

50:38.040 --> 50:40.200
This is what they use.
All Hollywood stunt drivers
use them

50:40.240 --> 50:41.800
if they want to look...
Then you...and just...

50:41.840 --> 50:43.800
It's like looking
in a mirror.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.560
-That is... Look.

50:46.600 --> 50:49.120
Seriously, can you tell that
that's not... Look at this.

50:52.160 --> 50:54.360
Identical.
Now, put your helmet on.

50:54.400 --> 50:55.800
-Yeah.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.720
Shall we see
what Mark looked like
with the helmet on?

51:05.760 --> 51:06.920
-Yes.

51:10.080 --> 51:12.480
It's uncanny,
it really is, look at that.

51:12.520 --> 51:15.280
What it is is wanton cruelty
on your part.

51:15.320 --> 51:16.680
But anyway, listen.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.480
I did use Mark
for that one scene, I admit.

51:19.520 --> 51:22.040
Yeah, you did.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.120
It's a shame you didn't use
him for the sheep-herding
scene though, isn't it?

51:24.160 --> 51:25.960
-Don't show that.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.040
No, no seriously,
do not show that.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.960
PHIL: Action, Jeremy,
when you're ready.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.640
So I've got
to get these sheep

51:34.680 --> 51:37.080
in that pen
in the far corner,

51:37.120 --> 51:42.360
in an exciting and
exuberant...YouTubey way.
Here we go.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.480
Speed and power,
that's the solution.

51:51.680 --> 51:55.040
Duh...uh, nothing!

51:55.080 --> 51:56.920
-Right, just get these
stragglers...

51:58.360 --> 51:59.400
-Don't go...

52:01.200 --> 52:02.760
-Come on!

52:02.800 --> 52:04.520
Oh, shit!

52:07.160 --> 52:08.880
I can't believe this.

52:08.920 --> 52:12.680
Listen, you can either
round them up really slowly,

52:12.720 --> 52:14.000
which is quite
boring television,

52:14.040 --> 52:15.920
or you can give it
some of that.

52:15.960 --> 52:17.600
And if you give it
some of that,

52:17.640 --> 52:19.960
which is exciting for
the ladies and gentlemen,

52:20.000 --> 52:21.680
you're inevitably
going to hit some sheep.

52:25.280 --> 52:29.480
You've done one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

52:29.520 --> 52:31.000
eight, nine, ten,
11 sheep.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.160
And broken the windscreen.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.800
I think the windscreen
is the least of our worries,
to be honest with you.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.280
Well, not really,
not for continuity,

52:37.320 --> 52:40.200
cos it's hard
to cover that up.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.920
This isn't how they do it
on the normal film.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.200
Well, how do they do it?

52:45.240 --> 52:46.840
-Well, he doesn't crash it
every five minutes.
-I haven't crashed it.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.560
You have crashed it,
and you've killed things now.

52:48.600 --> 52:49.760
Well, a bit...

52:53.400 --> 52:57.080
No.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.160
Please, don't...
Don't clap. He's a murderer.

53:01.200 --> 53:05.400
They...they would
have been jumpers by now,
or Sunday lunch.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.160
It's not the end
of the world.

53:07.200 --> 53:10.240
No, all right, but the next
bit nearly was, wasn't it?

53:13.600 --> 53:16.040
How the ... How am
I going to film with that?

53:17.760 --> 53:19.120
JEREMY: Phil?

53:19.160 --> 53:21.040
-Rolled it.

53:21.080 --> 53:22.760
Just make it go
the other way up,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.320
whenever you've got a moment.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.440
Now I know what it's like
to be Richard Hammond.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.800
Thanks, chaps.

53:40.720 --> 53:43.200
-We can edit that out.
-No, we can't. Look at it.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.840
What
The door...

53:44.880 --> 53:47.240
This, look. I can't do
any of the drone shots now.

53:47.280 --> 53:50.280
This is all smashed to bits.
This is wrong.

53:50.320 --> 53:53.320
-You're such a fusspot.
-Oil's come out of it.

53:53.360 --> 53:56.080
Honestly.
It still works well.

53:56.120 --> 53:57.600
Pull that towards...

53:57.640 --> 53:59.400
-Completely...
-You haven't asked about me.

53:59.440 --> 54:00.800
You're fine, aren't you?
You've got your helmet on.

54:04.680 --> 54:07.880
-No.
-They didn't care.

54:07.920 --> 54:10.520
I was risking my life for
the ladies and gentlemen.
Nobody cares.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.600
-Right, all right.

54:13.640 --> 54:16.360
Let's move on
to the end of your film.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.480
The big finale?
Which was brilliant.

54:18.520 --> 54:20.960
-Hmm, yeah.
Well, it wasn't, was it?
-Yes, it was.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.960
No, well, this is the bit,
ladies and gentlemen,

54:23.000 --> 54:25.920
where Jeremy attempted
to jump over a river.

54:25.960 --> 54:28.080
-I did jump over a river.
-No, you didn't.

54:28.120 --> 54:31.520
-I did.
-No, you didn't,
as we shall now prove.

54:37.360 --> 54:39.160
Dyke Jump. Take one.

54:40.840 --> 54:42.160
PHIL: Action, action.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.040
JEREMY: Let's do this!

54:58.960 --> 55:00.680
Sorry!

55:00.720 --> 55:02.680
PHIL: What a prick.

55:04.520 --> 55:06.040
JEREMY: Erm...

55:07.880 --> 55:09.400
Really  it now.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.360
Yeah, no, I think
that's pretty much had it.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.400
-Look at it, look at it.
-I know!

55:13.440 --> 55:15.640
-I've... We've...
-We haven't got an ending.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.960
-You're supposed to go over.
-We'll just use another car.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.600
-It's the big stunt.
-I've got a backup car.

55:20.640 --> 55:22.400
We'll use that.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.800
Is that it?
Is that enough now?

55:26.840 --> 55:28.200
-Nearly.
-No.

55:28.240 --> 55:30.760
Right, hold on.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.400
-Let's move on, shall we...
-You're not still
going on about--

55:33.440 --> 55:35.560
No, I am, because
I think we would like to see

55:35.600 --> 55:37.680
the grand finale
of Jeremy's film

55:37.720 --> 55:39.520
and his backup car, yes?

55:39.560 --> 55:41.280
ALL: Yes!
-Yes, right.

56:14.360 --> 56:16.600
Oh, shit.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.840
JAMES: No. No, I'm sorry.

56:41.680 --> 56:43.240
Hold on.

56:43.280 --> 56:46.440
Your backup car,
it was an Audi.

56:46.480 --> 56:50.160
OK, who here... Who here
noticed that was an Audi?

56:50.200 --> 56:52.160
ALL: Yes!

56:52.200 --> 56:55.480
Yeah, so everybody noticed
that because it was obvious.

56:55.520 --> 56:57.480
I tell you what, why don't
you explain to everyone

56:57.520 --> 57:00.520
how magicians cut
a lady in half in a box?

57:00.560 --> 57:03.160
-I don't know
how that's done.
-Exactly, cos it's magic!

57:03.200 --> 57:05.920
People don't want to know
how it's done.

57:05.960 --> 57:08.080
And nobody wanted to know
how I had made my film.

57:08.120 --> 57:10.640
And you told them,
and now you've
spoiled everybody's year.

57:10.680 --> 57:12.800
-And on that terrible
disappointment,

57:12.840 --> 57:14.240
it is time to end this time.

57:14.280 --> 57:15.640
Thank you
so much for watching.

57:15.680 --> 57:16.800
I'm sorry about these two.

57:16.840 --> 57:17.960
See you next time. Goodbye.
