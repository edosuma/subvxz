01:09.836 --> 01:13.807
FAMILY FOR RENT

02:02.588 --> 02:04.226
If I may be so bold,

02:04.824 --> 02:08.636
the doctor advised you
not to listen to sad music, boss.

02:11.564 --> 02:12.907
It's not sad.

02:13.099 --> 02:14.442
It's the PathÃ©tique.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.069
Yes.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.543
Nonetheless, this type of music...

02:23.576 --> 02:24.611
is very dark.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.620
The world is dark, Leon.

02:36.255 --> 02:38.599
I think I'll take a blue one...

02:38.991 --> 02:41.767
I get the feeling
the green ones depress me.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.909
How long will I need them?

02:45.098 --> 02:47.908
I don't think
this is the moment to stop, boss.

03:46.692 --> 03:48.228
What are you supposed to do?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.637
Starve to death?

03:52.331 --> 03:53.833
I'd rather steal than beg!

03:54.033 --> 03:57.139
I've looked for work for years!
There aren't any jobs!

04:09.615 --> 04:10.719
Are you ok?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.260
Mommy, he's dead!

04:12.452 --> 04:14.090
Are you alright, sir?

04:15.121 --> 04:16.361
Look at that.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.002
Here at the courthouse we're waiting
for the release of Violet Mandini,

04:21.194 --> 04:22.229
aka, "The Clobberer,"

04:22.862 --> 04:24.398
in reference to her act...

04:24.597 --> 04:27.441
They say it took the guard one hour
to come round.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.544
...Emile Zola's famous work

04:29.735 --> 04:32.341
describing the ravages of poverty.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.279
Violet Mandini! Over here!

04:36.476 --> 04:38.114
Do you have anything to say?

04:39.312 --> 04:41.383
They want to take away my children.

04:41.747 --> 04:43.226
That's what they want!

04:43.416 --> 04:44.793
I 'II die without my kids!

04:45.785 --> 04:46.729
I'll die!

04:47.153 --> 04:48.894
Did they tell you why?

04:49.555 --> 04:51.057
Will you appeal?

04:51.257 --> 04:52.201
Appeal to who?

04:52.391 --> 04:54.871
- And the kids?
- They say I'm a bad mother!

04:55.495 --> 04:57.805
That my stealing
jeopardizes their future!

04:57.997 --> 05:00.102
But is stealing to eat a crime?

05:00.299 --> 05:01.039
I say no!

05:01.234 --> 05:04.044
But separating them
from their mother is a crime!

05:05.137 --> 05:06.241
Family...

05:06.672 --> 05:07.810
My family...

05:08.007 --> 05:09.748
There's nothing more precious.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.218
In troubled times,
family is a haven of peace.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.084
Harmony,

05:14.514 --> 05:16.255
gentleness, comfort...

05:16.983 --> 05:19.088
And they want
to deprive my kids of that?

05:20.286 --> 05:21.959
Without your family's love,

05:22.488 --> 05:24.729
you're no more than a sounding brass,

05:24.924 --> 05:26.335
a banging cymbal.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.833
St. Paul said it, not me.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.404
What are you without family?

05:33.466 --> 05:34.501
Nothing.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.241
Nothing.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.194
I saw you on TV.
You sure gave it to them!

06:27.386 --> 06:28.865
Thanks, hon. I tried.

06:29.355 --> 06:32.131
I liked the part about St. Paul
and the gang!

06:32.325 --> 06:33.702
That was my lawyer.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.634
But I need more than fancy words.

06:35.828 --> 06:36.704
Hang in there!

06:37.363 --> 06:38.307
Thanks.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.712
What do you want?

06:49.508 --> 06:51.215
Are you Violet Mandini?

06:52.778 --> 06:53.518
Maybe.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.053
Would you please come with me?

06:58.017 --> 06:58.688
Uh...

06:58.884 --> 06:59.692
No.

07:00.886 --> 07:02.160
You should.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.834
Why?

07:05.958 --> 07:08.871
My boss has an offer to make you.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.067
- Your boss?
-Yes.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.844
An offer that might possibly help you.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.416
Mr. Delalande will receive you.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.135
Can I get you something to drink?

07:40.459 --> 07:41.733
No, thank you.

07:43.562 --> 07:44.302
Ok.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.976
I'm a rich man.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.737
I make...

07:49.935 --> 07:52.381
or rather
I made computer software.

07:53.439 --> 07:54.543
I see.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.782
And then...

07:55.975 --> 07:57.215
Later on...

07:57.410 --> 08:00.152
I worked too hard and I burned out.

08:00.446 --> 08:01.891
I burned out...

08:04.183 --> 08:05.787
and sold everything.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.057
Even my favorite software.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.063
"Imaginestic."

08:11.757 --> 08:14.237
So now you're unemployed?

08:14.694 --> 08:16.765
No! I wouldn't say that.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.604
But I no longer need to work.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.147
You have enough money
to live until you die.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.516
Far more than that.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.783
How can I help you?

09:10.082 --> 09:11.891
That is an excellent question.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.790
You can imagine, with my life...

09:16.856 --> 09:18.358
I never had time to...

09:18.557 --> 09:19.968
how do you say it...

09:20.159 --> 09:21.229
found a family!

09:22.561 --> 09:23.904
Yes, I can imagine.

09:24.697 --> 09:28.304
And yet... as you said yourself,
it's very important.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.912
But I'm not sure...

09:31.036 --> 09:33.380
I'm not sure that I can...

09:35.541 --> 09:37.020
that I know how.

09:39.945 --> 09:42.482
I'd like to try it out beforehand.

09:44.049 --> 09:45.323
Try out what?

09:45.518 --> 09:46.588
A family.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.395
Try out a family?

09:56.529 --> 09:57.906
Here's my proposal.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.771
I'll pay your debts
and one year's wages.

10:00.966 --> 10:04.573
I'll ensure that the State
doesn't take your children away.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.181
And in exchange...

10:07.273 --> 10:09.685
you let me be part of your family.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.896
I let you be part of my family?

10:20.085 --> 10:21.086
Yes.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.526
He's mentally ill!

10:24.890 --> 10:26.198
He's got real problems.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.531
No one in real life
wants a guy like that.

10:28.727 --> 10:32.300
No wonder he's locked up all alone
in his psychotic ward.

10:32.498 --> 10:34.808
He's different.
He's not a bad person.

10:37.403 --> 10:38.438
May I?

10:38.637 --> 10:39.945
Help yourself.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.243
Thank you.

10:44.743 --> 10:48.919
It's not because he doesn't
have a family that he can buy one.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.120
No one does that.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.265
He wants me to lie to my children?

10:56.455 --> 10:58.799
Make them think I met some...

10:59.825 --> 11:03.102
Who's the guy who wears a black cape
and lives in a cave?

11:03.295 --> 11:04.069
Batman.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.298
Yeah, that's it.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.945
Just thinking about it makes me...

11:11.437 --> 11:13.007
Just for money...

11:14.540 --> 11:15.678
and debts...

11:16.642 --> 11:18.178
A shitload of debts.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.831
Firstly, not a word to the kids.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.325
In my world, love can't be bought.

11:30.522 --> 11:32.968
And I want it to stay that way
for my kids. Ok?

11:33.459 --> 11:34.437
Secondly,

11:34.627 --> 11:37.335
we make them think
that we're really in love.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.137
Love at first sight.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.305
Love at first sight?

11:42.501 --> 11:44.481
Yes.
It happens to me all the time.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.310
Both my kids' fathers
were love at first sight.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.383
Even if they didn't stick around.

11:50.976 --> 11:51.784
Trio...

11:51.977 --> 11:52.978
Thirdly.

11:53.479 --> 11:54.958
- What?
- Excuse me.

11:55.714 --> 11:56.886
You move in with me.

11:57.082 --> 11:59.358
Because this is...

12:00.219 --> 12:00.856
No.

12:01.053 --> 12:01.895
No way.

12:02.087 --> 12:04.795
There's no way
my kids are moving into this...

12:04.990 --> 12:06.196
bunker.

12:09.094 --> 12:11.631
I understand,
but you can't say this is...

12:11.830 --> 12:15.403
My kids have their habits.
School, their rooms, their friends...

12:15.601 --> 12:17.080
I won't upset their lives.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.147
No more sports cars or rich kid's toys.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.048
I agree.
No outward signs of conspicuous...

12:24.443 --> 12:25.478
consumption.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.749
The less your money shows the better.

12:27.947 --> 12:30.086
You sort out my problems
and in three months

12:30.282 --> 12:31.386
we say goodbye.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.857
Is that all?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.193
Is that all?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.028
For now.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.496
Very well.

12:42.795 --> 12:46.504
We're off to live
a three-month family adventure!

12:47.399 --> 12:48.742
I want a contract.

12:49.401 --> 12:53.577
A clear and precise contract.
In three months, the game is over.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.849
Goodbye, Violet.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.016
I guess...

13:04.249 --> 13:05.455
we're going to...

13:05.985 --> 13:08.022
That I'll have to...

13:09.722 --> 13:10.962
Excuse me?

13:11.490 --> 13:13.128
That we'll sleep together.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.299
- We'll have to...
-Yes?

13:17.496 --> 13:19.737
We'll have to sleep in the same room.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.108
Yeah, I see.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.615
No, no, no!

13:26.005 --> 13:27.643
Nothing else.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.248
Nothing else?

13:34.246 --> 13:35.884
I wouldn't dream of it.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.930
I'm trying out a family,
not a woman.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.626
You mean...

13:44.323 --> 13:45.961
- I don't have to...
- No.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.131
Really?

13:51.130 --> 13:52.131
Ok.

13:53.432 --> 13:54.274
If you say so.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.604
See you Monday.

14:31.703 --> 14:33.683
Drive around the block again, Leon.

14:33.872 --> 14:37.285
- It's the fourth time, sir.
-I know. It's the last time.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.786
Then you can drop me off
on the comer.

14:39.978 --> 14:40.979
Alright?

15:01.166 --> 15:03.168
Are you going to sleep here?

15:03.368 --> 15:05.541
Of course!
He's my sweetheart.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.212
Since when?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.315
No one told us.
We're your kids, aren't we?

15:10.876 --> 15:12.321
Yes, of course.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.320
But we only met...

15:15.514 --> 15:16.515
three days ago.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.217
And so... it was...

15:18.884 --> 15:19.988
it was...

15:20.185 --> 15:21.823
It was love at first sight.

15:22.020 --> 15:24.159
That's it. Love at first sight.

15:24.356 --> 15:25.664
Again?

15:27.059 --> 15:29.733
The players want to hear their fans!

15:29.928 --> 15:31.236
Super! Yes, yes!

15:31.530 --> 15:32.770
Only this time...

15:34.766 --> 15:35.506
it's serious.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.681
I thought you'd had it with love?

15:38.137 --> 15:41.414
You don't control
this kind of thing, Lucie.

15:42.307 --> 15:44.548
It hits you over the head...

15:44.743 --> 15:46.279
like a ton of bricks!

15:48.213 --> 15:50.022
An Olympic record!

15:51.250 --> 15:52.923
How did you meet?

15:55.487 --> 15:57.524
I saw your mother on TV.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.568
On T\/.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.432
I found her strikingly beautiful.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.297
And by pure chance,

16:04.496 --> 16:06.635
we ran into each other...

16:07.399 --> 16:08.742
at the employment office.

16:08.934 --> 16:09.912
Oh, brother.

16:12.971 --> 16:17.750
I was there because
I want to start up a new company.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.057
It takes money to start a company.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.452
Of course.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.488
But I have money.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.253
Yes, he certainly does.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.168
Could you tell me what he's doing?

16:31.356 --> 16:33.495
The Fosbury Flop.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.267
So there you go.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.333
We instantly hit it off

16:38.530 --> 16:42.171
and we decided to live together
for three months.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.143
- I mean for life!
-To try it out, for life.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.907
Do we have anything to say?

16:47.105 --> 16:47.742
No.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.318
Great.
Welcome to North Korea!

16:52.978 --> 16:55.288
Do you have kids?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.653
No.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.288
Then you can spoil us!

17:01.954 --> 17:03.331
Spoil you? Maybe.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.593
- How about an Xbox One?
- Excuse me?

17:05.790 --> 17:06.701
Auguste!

17:06.892 --> 17:09.805
Get this straight,
there'll be no extra spending.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.165
Isn't that right, Mr. Andre?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.708
- This isn't about money.
-Absolutely not.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.310
You call him "mister"?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.012
Did she call me "mister"?

17:23.909 --> 17:25.319
Did I say that?

17:28.079 --> 17:29.218
I said that?

17:29.414 --> 17:32.224
She must've said it for fun,
because otherwise no.

17:32.417 --> 17:33.896
No, not that I know of.

17:34.086 --> 17:35.895
- No.
-I don't call him "mister."

17:36.088 --> 17:37.465
Or maybe for a joke!

17:39.925 --> 17:42.906
Excuse me,
could you get off my suitcase?

17:44.162 --> 17:45.732
You know what I suggest?

17:46.531 --> 17:48.909
To celebrate my arrival...

17:49.101 --> 17:52.310
I'll take you out
to the best restaurant in town!

17:52.504 --> 17:54.415
Your choice. Your favorite place.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.488
Auguste!

18:03.682 --> 18:04.888
You're in their way!

18:09.454 --> 18:11.695
Getaway! Mom, do something!

18:11.890 --> 18:13.528
He's the one who started!

18:14.793 --> 18:16.568
You're giving me a headache!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.764
It's the first time we go outwith...

18:19.398 --> 18:20.536
Uh... Paul-Andre.

18:20.732 --> 18:21.836
Paul-Andre.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.445
And you can't...

18:23.635 --> 18:24.773
What's so funny?

18:24.970 --> 18:26.449
It's his name.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.282
Your name.

18:28.473 --> 18:30.009
The dude's name is Paul-Andre.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.050
That's right.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.190
- Do you know anyone called Paul-Andre?
-Yes, him.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.357
Paul-Andre!

18:35.947 --> 18:38.188
- Didn't your mother love you?
- Stop it!

18:38.383 --> 18:40.420
- His mother is dead.
- She is?

18:42.921 --> 18:44.298
What about your dad?

18:47.125 --> 18:48.763
My father argued with...

18:50.228 --> 18:51.798
My parents fell out.

18:52.431 --> 18:56.743
And when my father left,
my mother put me in boarding school.

18:56.935 --> 18:57.913
Boarding school?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.778
You poor thing!

18:59.971 --> 19:02.451
No brothers or sisters or anything?

19:02.641 --> 19:03.949
Nothing at all.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.484
How old were you when your dad left?

19:09.014 --> 19:10.049
Four.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.093
Like Lucie's dad.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.595
Auguste's dad left before he was born.
Huh, Lucie?

19:17.522 --> 19:19.832
Mine left when I was five.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.232
Remy was nine and a half
and I was five.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.838
Yeah, but we're not weird.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.608
Paul-Andre isn't weird.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.402
Yes, he is.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.651
Lucie, is your homework done?

19:39.845 --> 19:41.756
Then go wash up! Come on!

19:42.314 --> 19:44.760
No arguing. Do what I say!

19:44.950 --> 19:46.827
I said to turn that off.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.157
I'm not done! I didn't save my game!

19:49.354 --> 19:50.992
Then it won't be saved.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.793
Lucie! Bathroom!

19:52.991 --> 19:54.868
I said into the bathroom!

19:56.661 --> 19:58.538
Come on, both of you!

19:58.730 --> 19:59.936
Stop arguing!

20:00.132 --> 20:02.442
I'm turning this off right now.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.113
Sweetheart, please.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.116
Lucie! I won't say it again!

20:10.175 --> 20:12.018
Leave it, I'll take care of it.

20:12.210 --> 20:15.657
Auguste wants you to say goodnight
and tell him a story.

20:16.515 --> 20:18.290
Aren't we going to bed?

20:18.483 --> 20:20.224
Nope. Bedtime story first.

20:22.521 --> 20:24.159
You want me to do the dishes?

20:24.356 --> 20:25.801
We'll do it tomorrow.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.561
Paul-Andre, are you coming?

20:32.197 --> 20:33.835
I don't know any stories.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.177
Moreover, I'm not sure
that telling stories is a good idea

20:38.370 --> 20:41.408
because kids never know
if they're true or not.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.078
I guarantee you,
bedtime stories are a great idea.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.590
They can be extremely traumatic.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.384
One trauma more or less...

20:50.582 --> 20:53.654
This was your idea.
You wanted to try out a family?

20:53.852 --> 20:56.924
Bedtime stories are part of it
and I could use a break.

20:57.355 --> 21:00.859
I need to check
the fine print in this contract.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.205
That's where you get screwed.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.500
Come on!

21:06.364 --> 21:08.708
The train literally ran over him!

21:09.935 --> 21:11.039
Was he squashed?

21:11.536 --> 21:13.209
Of course he was squashed!

21:13.405 --> 21:16.943
- The train cut him in half.
- Did he die?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.349
- Lucie, no smoking at night!
-I'm not!

21:19.544 --> 21:21.182
- Did he die or not?
-Yes, he died.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.255
But what?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.257
You'll set the house on fire!

21:25.450 --> 21:27.123
The two halves of his body...

21:27.319 --> 21:31.267
the top part and the bottom part,
got back together.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.298
How?

21:33.158 --> 21:35.764
- Put that cigarette out right now!
-Leave me alone!

21:35.961 --> 21:37.531
How did he do it?

21:37.929 --> 21:39.465
He crawled.

21:39.664 --> 21:42.440
The bottom part crawled back
to the top part.

21:42.634 --> 21:46.138
Then he looked for the guy
who pushed him under the train

21:46.338 --> 21:47.715
to make mincemeat of him.

21:47.906 --> 21:49.112
What's mincemeat?

21:49.307 --> 21:51.378
Don't tell me what to do, ok?

21:51.576 --> 21:53.783
I'm your mother
and you'll do what I say!

21:54.312 --> 21:57.054
Mincemeat is ground meat.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.255
Ok.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.294
Is he going to grind him?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.557
You'll find out next time.

22:04.623 --> 22:05.795
I want to know now.

22:05.991 --> 22:06.935
I'll run away!

22:07.125 --> 22:09.571
Next time, ok? Now it's bedtime.

22:11.162 --> 22:13.108
- Leon, it's me.
- Yes, sir.

22:13.298 --> 22:16.336
You have to get me out of here.
It's horrible.

22:16.868 --> 22:19.280
But you just got there.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.077
Leon, you know
the downward spiral theory.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.652
The cogwheel starts spinning,

22:24.843 --> 22:26.982
it gains momentum,

22:27.178 --> 22:31.149
and the process becomes
increasingly difficult to interrupt.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.851
You know that, rig ht?

22:33.285 --> 22:35.356
You should see this place!

22:35.554 --> 22:39.161
You wouldn't believe how they live.
It's total chaos!

22:40.191 --> 22:42.364
- Paul-Andre, are you alright?
-Yes!

22:42.561 --> 22:44.370
- Are you sure?
-Of course!

22:44.563 --> 22:46.008
I'm having a quick wash.

22:46.498 --> 22:47.841
Freshening up!

22:49.234 --> 22:51.043
You'll call me back?

22:51.236 --> 22:52.112
Of course, sir.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.783
- You promise?
- I promise.

23:01.379 --> 23:02.483
Sorry.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.219
What exactly are you doing?

23:06.418 --> 23:08.830
Covering two pushed apart beds
with one quilt

23:09.020 --> 23:11.296
so it looks like
we're sleeping together.

23:11.690 --> 23:12.794
Smart thinking.

23:13.325 --> 23:17.671
But we need to act a little more
affectionate with each other.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.808
Lucie already made a comment.

23:20.665 --> 23:22.235
What did she say?

23:23.068 --> 23:26.572
She said that when
I'm head over heels in love, I'm more...

23:26.771 --> 23:29.342
So we'll have to fake it
in front of them.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.043
But otherwise, no touching.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.417
I'm wiped out.

23:33.612 --> 23:37.389
I have a suggestion.
Why don't we get a cleaning lady?

23:37.582 --> 23:38.356
What for?

23:38.550 --> 23:41.030
To straighten up a bit.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.595
I'm not sure cleaning ladies
know what they're doing.

23:46.791 --> 23:47.769
Fine.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.203
Can I have the left side?

23:52.897 --> 23:54.274
- Sure.
-Thank you.

24:05.410 --> 24:08.516
Is everything alright
between you and Lucie?

24:09.247 --> 24:10.590
Of course. Why?

24:12.117 --> 24:13.460
Just asking.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.962
Tell me... do you mind if I read?

24:23.261 --> 24:24.296
If what?

24:24.496 --> 24:27.909
If I read?
I need to read to fall asleep.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.304
But don't worry, I'm fully equipped.

24:33.471 --> 24:34.745
I can see that.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.437
Who are you?

25:34.365 --> 25:35.537
Excuse me?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.605
Are you a homosexual?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.707
I don't think so.

25:46.177 --> 25:47.349
Impotent?

25:47.545 --> 25:48.853
Not that either.

26:03.528 --> 26:05.303
You are weird, after all.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.340
Auguste was right.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.041
He's got a good eye.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.148
Men knock you up and split.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.411
So no thanks.

26:19.110 --> 26:21.590
All I want is a good job.
Forget love.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.987
And one more jerk
won't change my mind!

26:24.182 --> 26:25.490
Stop talking like that!

26:25.683 --> 26:27.720
No! I'm sick of living like this.

26:28.119 --> 26:29.359
You said no more men!

26:29.554 --> 26:30.726
One day we're orphans,

26:30.922 --> 26:33.732
-the next day we're not.
-If you're not happy, leave!

26:33.925 --> 26:35.336
That's not the point.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.530
That's enough, ok?

26:37.729 --> 26:39.402
Auguste, give me your bowl.

26:40.231 --> 26:41.676
Good morning!

26:41.866 --> 26:42.936
Good morning.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.275
There you go!

26:47.906 --> 26:49.579
What a pretty breakfast table.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.617
- Sleep well?
- Great!

27:20.805 --> 27:21.783
Everything ok?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.145
Just fine.

27:24.642 --> 27:27.452
Except that the sun's out.
I hate nice weather.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.919
You don't like the sun?

27:29.314 --> 27:30.292
No.

27:32.016 --> 27:33.120
It depresses me.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.093
Is that my telephone?

27:35.286 --> 27:38.267
I'm only playing.
I didn't look at your messages.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.329
That's good, sweetie.

27:43.795 --> 27:44.466
50!

27:44.662 --> 27:48.576
What'll we do today?
How about a museum exhibition?

27:49.167 --> 27:51.670
Or we could go bowling?

27:54.305 --> 27:56.251
We have to go to school.

27:57.442 --> 27:58.648
Of course you do!

27:58.843 --> 28:01.915
I have to help Remy.
You know, my big brother.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.828
And what do I do?

28:09.187 --> 28:10.996
Why don't you try working too?

28:13.858 --> 28:16.304
- I'll brush my teeth.
-Very good, honey.

28:16.494 --> 28:17.996
But hurry up!

28:20.031 --> 28:21.942
You could walk Auguste to school.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.874
- Watch outwith that!
- It's cool.

28:24.068 --> 28:25.172
He'd love it.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.512
We'll see each other tonight.

28:28.973 --> 28:29.974
Goodbye, kids.

28:30.174 --> 28:31.380
Love you!

28:31.576 --> 28:32.782
Goodbye, Mom!

28:33.711 --> 28:35.213
Get out, it's my tum!

28:35.413 --> 28:37.154
You're the one in my way!

28:41.519 --> 28:44.966
The probability
of a 6,000-mile-diameter meteorite

28:45.156 --> 28:46.897
hitting Earth is almost zero.

28:47.091 --> 28:49.002
But it doesn't need to be that big.

28:49.193 --> 28:51.400
Six miles in diameter would be plenty!

28:52.230 --> 28:54.733
There would be
utter chaos and commotion.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.413
It would be the end of the world!

28:59.237 --> 29:01.649
Morn never talks about
the end of the world.

29:01.839 --> 29:02.817
Is it for sure?

29:03.374 --> 29:05.251
It's mathematically proven.

29:05.443 --> 29:06.717
I'm lousy at math.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.721
What don't you understand?
I can explain it to you.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.257
Everything.

29:11.449 --> 29:13.554
And I'm not just bad at math.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.762
Lucie's the smart one.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.698
It's because she studies harder.

29:19.457 --> 29:21.437
It's not a question of studying.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.766
You see,
mathematics are like...

29:26.064 --> 29:29.375
A great mathematician once said that
math was like music...

29:29.567 --> 29:31.205
You can leave me here.

29:40.611 --> 29:42.249
I forgot to kiss you goodbye.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.519
You know,
just in case there's a meteorite.

29:47.919 --> 29:48.954
Bye!

30:05.636 --> 30:07.638
THE MANAGER IS IN THE STAIRWELL

30:13.511 --> 30:16.048
Thanks, baby sis.
You won't forget the mail?

30:16.247 --> 30:17.885
No. Go on!

30:18.082 --> 30:19.254
Ok.

30:19.784 --> 30:21.320
Hey, listen...

30:21.986 --> 30:23.556
Don't get too attached.

30:23.755 --> 30:26.258
You know men,
once they get what they want...

30:26.457 --> 30:27.663
Get out of here.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.497
And look for a soul mate
while you're at it.

30:32.663 --> 30:34.074
I have a soul mate.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.507
You're my soul mate.

30:41.305 --> 30:42.477
Hello?

30:43.474 --> 30:44.578
Who?

30:45.143 --> 30:46.952
Oh hello, Paul-Andre!

30:48.212 --> 30:50.419
Yes. I'll be home for dinner.

30:50.615 --> 30:54.961
The bisector of an angular sector
divides the said sector

30:55.153 --> 30:58.828
into two mirror angular sectors.
That's simple enough, right?

30:59.023 --> 31:00.866
What did you do this afternoon?

31:01.559 --> 31:03.266
I saw a friend of mine.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.997
So what is a bisector?

31:05.196 --> 31:06.300
What's his name?

31:06.497 --> 31:08.272
His name is Leon.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.374
- Is he your best friend?
- No.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.041
He's my assistant.

31:13.237 --> 31:17.276
The bisector is a line
that comes from an angular sector.

31:17.475 --> 31:18.886
What's an angular sector?

31:19.077 --> 31:23.184
I already told you, an angular sector
is that which relates to an angle.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.122
You understand? An angle!

31:25.316 --> 31:27.353
Then why don't you call it an angle?

31:27.552 --> 31:30.499
You can call it an angle!
That's not what matters.

31:30.688 --> 31:34.465
What matters is that you understand
what a bisector is!

31:34.859 --> 31:37.066
When's the next meteorite coming?

31:38.563 --> 31:40.907
I have no idea.

31:41.365 --> 31:42.207
Are you scared?

31:42.400 --> 31:43.504
No, I'm not scared.

31:43.701 --> 31:46.841
We're not even 100% sure
about this bisector!

31:47.205 --> 31:48.684
About this meteorite!

31:48.873 --> 31:50.045
For example, here.

31:50.241 --> 31:54.314
Show me where
you would place the bisector.

31:55.113 --> 31:55.921
Here.

31:56.447 --> 32:00.088
No. For one, it's wrong.
And two, you always use a ruler!

32:00.284 --> 32:03.322
Do you understand?
You always use a ruler!

32:03.521 --> 32:05.228
Ok?
And you sit up straight!

32:05.423 --> 32:09.030
You sit up straight when you do math.
Math deserves respect!

32:10.361 --> 32:11.499
Look who's here.

32:17.535 --> 32:19.173
We were doing some geometry.

32:23.307 --> 32:24.411
Are you ok?

32:24.609 --> 32:25.679
Yeah.

32:27.979 --> 32:30.084
- Did he explain it well?
-Yeah.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.357
- You'd tell me otherwise?
-Yeah, don't worry.

32:33.551 --> 32:34.723
You're sure?

33:04.148 --> 33:06.128
Did you have a nice day, honey?

33:07.451 --> 33:08.395
Swe eth eart?

33:09.587 --> 33:11.066
Did you have a nice day?

33:12.490 --> 33:13.628
Very nice.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.965
- Be careful with my phone.
- It's cool.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.414
There's no more fat-free yogurt?

33:28.606 --> 33:30.517
I'm sorry, I forget to get some.

33:30.708 --> 33:33.587
What's new?
You always forget about me.

33:34.212 --> 33:35.350
I'm really sorry.

33:35.546 --> 33:38.186
Maybe I could ask Leon
to take care of it?

33:38.783 --> 33:40.922
- Your assistant?
-Yes.

33:41.285 --> 33:43.526
We don't need Leon,
we can go by ourselves.

33:45.022 --> 33:46.262
What do you mean?

33:47.558 --> 33:50.368
What do I mean?
I mean go to the supermarket.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.204
Us?

33:53.831 --> 33:56.812
You mean a place
where they have those little carts

33:57.001 --> 33:58.708
that you ride around in?

33:58.903 --> 34:00.610
That's very...

34:01.872 --> 34:04.648
You'll have a hard time getting in,
you know.

34:05.243 --> 34:08.952
That sounds like an excellent idea!
What if we did that?

34:09.146 --> 34:10.523
We'll go shopping.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.319
Can I be nosy?

34:13.985 --> 34:14.690
I guess so.

34:14.885 --> 34:16.387
Who hit on who?

34:21.891 --> 34:23.132
That's a bit too nosy.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.801
Mom usually loves telling us.
Doesn't she?

34:27.531 --> 34:29.841
Yes, but this time it was...

34:30.201 --> 34:32.511
It was me. I'm the one...

34:33.170 --> 34:35.377
You could say it was me who started.

34:39.110 --> 34:42.250
I was totally lost
at the unemployment office

34:42.446 --> 34:45.085
because I couldn't fill out the forms.

34:45.283 --> 34:48.355
And so... I...

34:48.552 --> 34:51.692
I'd seen your mother before.
I saw her on TV.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.596
When I saw him looking at me,

34:53.791 --> 34:56.704
I asked for help
and he instantly sat down with me.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.872
He filled out the form.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.076
Just like that!

35:02.466 --> 35:04.912
You see... and I...

35:05.102 --> 35:07.605
I got up and stood behind him

35:07.805 --> 35:09.944
so I could look over his shoulder.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.519
And... I saw...

35:13.311 --> 35:14.551
I saw...

35:16.614 --> 35:17.786
The nape of his neck.

35:17.982 --> 35:19.859
I saw the nape of his neck.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.694
You know, Lucie,
the nape of a man's neck is...

35:27.124 --> 35:29.035
You'll understand one day.

35:29.226 --> 35:30.398
Yes, it's...

35:30.828 --> 35:33.206
And I fell head over heels in love.

35:33.564 --> 35:36.306
I instantly wanted...

35:36.500 --> 35:37.808
to touch him.

35:38.002 --> 35:39.208
Like this.

35:41.572 --> 35:44.644
Of course, I didn't do it.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.722
But you must have sensed
that I wanted to?

35:48.312 --> 35:49.222
Yes.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.984
- Did you feel it or not?
-Yes.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.731
Yes, he felt it.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.334
He must have felt it because...

36:01.926 --> 36:03.906
he took my hand like this.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.333
Right away.

36:06.530 --> 36:08.407
And it lasted...

36:09.533 --> 36:11.342
It lasted a very longtime.

36:12.169 --> 36:12.977
It was...

36:14.805 --> 36:16.250
It was...

36:18.175 --> 36:19.654
It was...

36:20.277 --> 36:21.688
A Monday.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.821
- It was Monday.
-Yes, that's right.

36:25.716 --> 36:26.922
And...

36:29.120 --> 36:30.292
That's all.

36:31.322 --> 36:32.767
That's what happened.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.272
The quickest pick-up in history.

36:45.069 --> 36:47.982
Yes! We made the Guinness Book.

36:51.709 --> 36:52.983
You're all red.

36:54.211 --> 36:55.349
I am?

36:56.347 --> 36:57.849
It must be...

36:58.883 --> 37:00.157
the memory of...

37:00.584 --> 37:02.723
the emotion of the memory.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.857
He's a real marshmallow at heart.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.296
Oh,yes.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.670
Didn't you say your mom was dead?

37:13.864 --> 37:16.401
- Absolutely.
- Because she's calling you.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.139
It says "Mother."

37:20.671 --> 37:21.877
So it does!

37:23.507 --> 37:26.886
When you say "my whole family is dead,"
it means everyone!

37:27.077 --> 37:28.522
You don't joke about that.

37:29.079 --> 37:31.650
My whole family is dead,
except my mother.

37:31.849 --> 37:32.919
Small detail.

37:33.117 --> 37:36.894
My mother and I rarely speak.
It's as if she were dead.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.695
That's terrible!

37:38.889 --> 37:42.564
If my mother were alive,
I'd smother her to death with kisses.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.205
Figuratively speaking.

37:44.395 --> 37:47.376
My mother and I... She doesn't like me.

37:48.732 --> 37:52.874
She doesn't care what happens to me,
so she must want something.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.277
She didn't call to see how I'm doing.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.518
What did you do
to make her not like you?

38:00.911 --> 38:04.017
Did you want to buy another mom
with your pocket money?

38:04.648 --> 38:05.718
No.

38:06.584 --> 38:07.722
I was born.

38:08.085 --> 38:10.190
Big mistake.
One should never be born.

38:10.621 --> 38:14.091
If she put you in boarding school,
she must've had problems.

38:15.626 --> 38:19.540
A mother always loves her children,
one way or another.

38:21.332 --> 38:22.436
Not mine.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.440
MY Zipper.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.875
You should call her back.

38:29.073 --> 38:30.313
Thank you.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.989
- Why are you getting dressed?
- I'm going out.

38:37.915 --> 38:40.225
I forgot!
I met someone at Remy's place.

38:40.417 --> 38:41.589
A good-looking guy.

38:41.785 --> 38:44.265
He's got a fabulous
clothing store downtown.

38:44.455 --> 38:46.162
I thought you could babysit...

38:46.690 --> 38:48.567
I won't be late, I promise.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.406
Didn't you say
that love was over for you?

38:56.133 --> 38:57.407
Men...

38:58.002 --> 38:59.811
I said love, not sex.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.351
I have physical needs.
I'm not a nun.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.484
Paul-Andre!

39:09.046 --> 39:10.320
My story!

39:27.464 --> 39:28.875
Paul-Andre!

39:29.366 --> 39:30.538
Paul-Andre?

39:34.071 --> 39:35.482
I'm afraid.

39:36.307 --> 39:37.217
What?

39:38.542 --> 39:40.146
Can I get in bed with you?

39:42.479 --> 39:44.288
Yes, ok.

39:48.085 --> 39:49.894
Mom isn't home yet?

39:50.521 --> 39:52.728
No. She's doing the grocery shopping.

39:52.923 --> 39:53.799
At night?

39:56.327 --> 39:57.738
Are you alright?

40:54.985 --> 40:56.794
- I'm late!
-I don't care!

40:56.987 --> 40:58.432
- Clear off the table!
- No!

40:58.622 --> 41:01.603
- Shut up and do what I say, ok?
- Thanks a lot!

41:02.159 --> 41:03.934
I do everything around here!

41:04.762 --> 41:05.638
I've had it!

41:05.829 --> 41:08.537
Are you still planning on
doing the shopping?

41:08.732 --> 41:11.542
The shopping?
Oh no, I forgot to tell you...

41:12.102 --> 41:13.308
I might've found a job.

41:13.504 --> 41:16.383
You know, the guy from last night.

41:16.573 --> 41:18.883
I'm doing atrial period in his shop.

41:19.443 --> 41:21.787
We're still doing
the shopping, aren't we?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.318
The shopping--

41:23.514 --> 41:25.084
I can't find my keys.

41:25.282 --> 41:26.955
The shopping?

41:28.318 --> 41:32.164
No, later on
I have to stop by Aunt Giselle's.

41:32.623 --> 41:33.658
Hang on.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.266
Here they are!

41:36.927 --> 41:38.304
Yes, Aunt Giselle.

41:38.495 --> 41:41.339
You'll meet her at the picnic
this weekend.

41:41.532 --> 41:42.340
Oh yeah?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.736
Here's the shopping list.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.471
I thought that maybe...

41:46.937 --> 41:49.008
We need some fat-free plain yogurt,

41:49.707 --> 41:52.119
low fat milk,
macaroni and grated cheese.

41:52.509 --> 41:54.318
- Ok.
-Thanks.

41:54.511 --> 41:56.491
Kids, are you ready to go?

41:57.314 --> 41:58.349
Goodbye.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.594
Goodbye, sweetheart.

42:03.487 --> 42:05.262
- Come on.
- See you tonight.

42:09.993 --> 42:13.099
- Do you have to sulk every morning?
-Leave me alone!

43:31.141 --> 43:33.052
Who cleaned up my room?

43:33.243 --> 43:36.520
My room is mine, it's off limits.
No one comes in!

43:36.713 --> 43:39.216
Is that so hard to understand,
Mr. Genius?

43:42.786 --> 43:45.130
Where's the ruler for the bisectors?

43:47.925 --> 43:50.132
- Right hand drawer.
- His room too?

43:50.327 --> 43:53.399
- You're crazy, you messed up...
-I cleaned up!

43:54.598 --> 43:56.578
I cleaned up. Alright?

43:56.767 --> 43:57.939
What is this?

43:58.135 --> 43:59.876
The law of the jungle?

44:01.638 --> 44:05.142
I wanted to find out, now I know.
It's the law of the jungle.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.481
Even family is the law of the jungle!

44:12.516 --> 44:13.722
We're all...

44:15.118 --> 44:16.222
We're...

44:18.088 --> 44:20.068
We're all alone, is that it?

44:23.827 --> 44:25.431
All I did was clean up.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.525
The guy was an asshole.

44:48.118 --> 44:50.029
He just wanted to use me.

44:51.622 --> 44:54.364
I don't deserve this!
Who do they think they are?

44:55.626 --> 44:56.764
But...

45:01.198 --> 45:04.179
How did he use you?

45:04.368 --> 45:06.939
He wouldn't pay me for my trial period!

45:07.137 --> 45:07.979
That's how.

45:10.140 --> 45:13.019
You agree with me, right?
He's using me.

45:13.510 --> 45:16.650
First he sleeps with me,
then he won't pay me for working?

45:17.347 --> 45:18.792
On the other hand...

45:18.982 --> 45:20.620
you wanted to...

45:21.151 --> 45:22.789
sleep with him too, right?

45:25.555 --> 45:27.535
- Would you have done that?
-What?

45:27.724 --> 45:29.897
Not pay you or sleep with you?

45:30.494 --> 45:31.495
Both.

45:33.497 --> 45:34.999
No. Neither one.

45:35.198 --> 45:37.178
There you go!

45:39.403 --> 45:40.746
- I feel so ashamed.
- Don't.

45:40.938 --> 45:44.545
I'm ashamed of this stupid game
we're playing.

45:44.741 --> 45:47.312
But the truth is, I can't do it alone.

45:47.511 --> 45:48.683
I can't cope.

45:48.879 --> 45:51.553
- For now...
- No, I'll never be able to!

45:52.282 --> 45:56.162
You're giving me a break
and then what? It'll be hell all over.

46:00.123 --> 46:02.831
You know what I feel like?
Like a whore.

46:03.026 --> 46:05.267
You like being part of a whore's family?

46:11.034 --> 46:12.206
What's that?

46:20.811 --> 46:22.119
It's for me?

46:25.482 --> 46:27.428
You don't give ?owers to a whore.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.404
Remy, put the tablecloth down!

46:45.602 --> 46:46.273
Need a hand?

46:46.470 --> 46:50.418
- Who have you met so farâ?
- Fabian. The driving instructor.

46:50.607 --> 46:52.609
- Isn't his wife gorgeous?
-Yes.

46:52.809 --> 46:54.550
- Did you see his kids?
-Yes.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.884
- Who made that?
-I did.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.889
- It's fabulous.
- Oh yeah?

46:59.082 --> 47:00.755
- A caterer made it.
- No, I did.

47:00.951 --> 47:04.057
When I get bored at Remy';
I make table decorations.

47:04.254 --> 47:06.131
- Are you serious?
-Yes.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.166
I think it's beautiful.

47:08.358 --> 47:09.393
It's very...

47:10.027 --> 47:12.064
- Thank you.
- It's very creative...

47:12.696 --> 47:14.937
You do it with vegetables?

47:15.132 --> 47:17.669
- Fruit or vegetables.
-Whatever comes...

47:18.168 --> 47:19.511
into your head.

47:21.104 --> 47:24.017
Violet's dream job
wasn't particularly glamorous!

47:25.475 --> 47:27.978
- Remy, come on!
- Listen to this...

47:28.378 --> 47:30.585
When I was about

47:30.781 --> 47:34.695
18 and she was 14,
you know what she wanted to be?

47:35.052 --> 47:36.929
Get this!

47:37.320 --> 47:40.927
She wanted to be a personal assistant.

47:41.124 --> 47:43.832
We sure had fun teasing her about that!

47:46.530 --> 47:48.373
Sorry, but that was my dream.

47:48.565 --> 47:52.172
I knew it was silly because
I'm not smart, but I loved the idea.

47:52.369 --> 47:55.612
It must've been
because of our neighbor, Mrs. Jouve.

47:55.806 --> 47:57.012
Mrs. Jouve!

47:57.207 --> 47:59.153
Mrs. Jouve, she was hot!

47:59.342 --> 48:00.218
Watch it!

48:00.410 --> 48:03.289
I loved watching her
leave for work in the morning,

48:03.480 --> 48:06.689
with her high heels clicking
and super elegant suits.

48:06.883 --> 48:07.827
That's right.

48:08.018 --> 48:10.726
And when Dad saw her,
he'd always say:

48:11.188 --> 48:13.293
"Now that's a woman who has class."

48:14.391 --> 48:16.234
it was real nice for Morn.

48:17.694 --> 48:20.800
Don't you need to speak English
to be a PA?

48:20.997 --> 48:21.975
Yes, of course.

48:22.165 --> 48:23.667
Not to mention spelling!

48:23.867 --> 48:26.404
Because Violet,
when it comes to spelling...

48:27.437 --> 48:30.384
I'm dyslexic. It's not my fault!

48:30.574 --> 48:32.918
All she cared about was boys.

48:33.110 --> 48:34.487
Isn't that right, Violet?

48:34.678 --> 48:37.887
- Boys were easier than spelling.
-And you were more talented!

48:39.616 --> 48:42.995
Yeah, you sure weren't dyslexic
when it came to boys!

48:43.186 --> 48:44.529
That was low!

48:47.090 --> 48:48.535
Come on, it's true.

48:48.725 --> 48:50.204
We're just joking.

48:50.393 --> 48:53.602
Julie was meant to be a hostess.
Weren't you, love?

48:56.766 --> 48:59.610
I wanted to be a hostess
ever since I was little.

49:01.037 --> 49:03.449
That's different, that's classy.

49:04.241 --> 49:07.552
Dad always said
"without class you're nothing."

49:07.744 --> 49:10.224
You either have it or you don't.

49:10.413 --> 49:13.087
And Violet, you don't.

49:14.151 --> 49:15.221
And you do?

49:15.418 --> 49:18.524
No way! It runs in the family,
we got no class.

49:18.722 --> 49:19.860
Excuse me.

49:20.490 --> 49:21.867
- Excuse me.
-Yeah?

49:23.226 --> 49:24.534
I think...

49:25.128 --> 49:26.436
lf I may say so...

49:26.630 --> 49:30.373
Violet is enthusiastic.
She's cheerful, she's kind...

49:31.067 --> 49:33.809
she's curious and people like her.

49:34.004 --> 49:35.711
Contrary to what you say,

49:35.906 --> 49:39.046
I think she'd make
an excellent personal assistant.

49:39.242 --> 49:41.620
Hey, we were joking.
Joking, you hear?

49:41.811 --> 49:44.314
It's our way of having fun.

49:44.514 --> 49:45.322
No.

49:45.982 --> 49:47.484
No, you're not joking.

49:48.585 --> 49:51.156
How do expect her to have confidence

49:51.354 --> 49:54.301
when all you do
is knock down everything she does?

49:55.792 --> 49:57.169
They have the right to talk.

49:57.360 --> 49:59.067
You can't let these no-hopers...

49:59.262 --> 50:02.766
Don't you insult my family!
You're no better than anyone here.

50:02.966 --> 50:04.240
That's for sure.

50:06.469 --> 50:09.006
- It's...
- Don't insult my family!

50:10.974 --> 50:12.282
It's them...

50:15.712 --> 50:17.692
He's warped.

50:17.881 --> 50:19.622
Hey, it's ok.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.828
Excuse me.

50:36.233 --> 50:39.009
- My, my.
-Where'd you find this one?

50:54.217 --> 50:57.960
For the picnic next week,
could we go to Chateaugrand instead?

50:58.488 --> 51:00.991
Nina lives close by. I could invite her.

51:02.993 --> 51:04.870
- Next week?
- We'll see.

51:05.929 --> 51:09.741
You're not having
another picnic next week?

51:09.933 --> 51:13.312
We have picnics every week!
That's what family's about.

51:13.737 --> 51:17.583
Thank god. Can you imagine us four
alone all weekend?

51:21.378 --> 51:25.690
Instead of picnicking each weekend,
we might consider a concert

51:25.882 --> 51:28.658
or a museum exhibition.

51:28.852 --> 51:29.728
What?

51:29.919 --> 51:33.492
I said I will not attend
a family picnic every weekend!

51:33.690 --> 51:36.728
You're a pain in the neck!
You all are!

51:40.130 --> 51:41.108
I want to get out.

51:41.731 --> 51:43.176
I want to get out.

51:43.767 --> 51:46.111
- Calm down.
- No, I'm getting out.

51:46.536 --> 51:49.210
Please, I want to get out.
Stop the car!

52:01.484 --> 52:04.624
What did I say?
It's been along day, everyone's tired.

52:04.821 --> 52:06.198
Don't shit a brick!

52:06.589 --> 52:08.125
Very elegant! Bravo!

52:08.325 --> 52:09.599
What's your problem?

52:09.793 --> 52:12.967
Picnics? Errands? The mess?
You just don't like family!

52:13.163 --> 52:17.612
When you talked about family,
you said "haven of peace" and "harmony."

52:19.336 --> 52:21.543
- "Human exchanges!"
-I said that?

52:21.738 --> 52:25.049
I listened to your interview again.
You spoke of comfort...

52:25.241 --> 52:27.881
"Without my family's love,
I'd be a booming gong..."

52:28.078 --> 52:30.888
But all you do is shout. Shout!

52:31.081 --> 52:35.223
Like before my father left,
all they did was shout.

52:35.418 --> 52:37.796
Shouting from morning to night!

52:37.987 --> 52:39.933
That's what family's about,
shouting!

52:40.790 --> 52:42.963
- You like when I kiss you.
-Yes. I mean no!

52:43.159 --> 52:45.230
No, because it's fake.

52:45.428 --> 52:47.908
- But you like Auguste for real?
-Yes.

52:48.531 --> 52:50.067
You're not going to stop?

52:50.266 --> 52:53.406
Listen, it's networking out.
It was a very bad idea.

52:53.603 --> 52:55.674
It's nothing but chaos.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.317
You're going to leave?

52:58.808 --> 53:00.617
I think it's the best thing to do.

53:00.810 --> 53:02.118
And what about me?

53:02.312 --> 53:04.349
I settled your debts.

53:04.547 --> 53:05.423
So...

53:06.549 --> 53:09.029
What about the one year's wages?

53:09.652 --> 53:12.155
There was a two-week trial period.

53:12.355 --> 53:13.595
- There was?
-Yes.

53:13.790 --> 53:16.361
I didn't see that.
It was really written tiny.

53:16.559 --> 53:19.199
Look for yourself. It's in the contract.

53:19.396 --> 53:21.137
You know what I think?

53:21.331 --> 53:24.710
I think you watched
"Little House on the Prairie" too much!

53:24.901 --> 53:28.872
You're no more mature than Auguste!
Your family fantasy is infantile!

53:29.072 --> 53:32.815
- So goodbye. I've had it too!
- Do you want a man or not?

53:33.343 --> 53:34.822
Make up your mind!

53:44.387 --> 53:45.559
Violet...

54:03.573 --> 54:05.519
I'm happy to see you again, boss.

54:28.531 --> 54:31.444
I was thinking,
we could buy something else.

54:32.969 --> 54:36.075
A while back,
you were thinking of an airplane.

54:36.272 --> 54:38.616
But how about a zeppelin?

54:41.578 --> 54:43.353
I like the idea of a zeppelin.

54:45.715 --> 54:47.626
Zeppelins catch fire.

54:50.820 --> 54:52.458
You're not going to...

54:53.923 --> 54:55.925
You're not going to relapse, boss?

54:56.125 --> 54:58.435
You haven't been out in three weeks.

55:04.133 --> 55:05.441
I think...

55:08.505 --> 55:10.576
This isn't easy to say, but...

55:11.641 --> 55:13.484
I might have a hypothesis.

55:16.613 --> 55:18.957
Maybe you miss
Violet and the children.

55:20.750 --> 55:21.626
No.

55:23.119 --> 55:24.291
But...

55:24.487 --> 55:27.593
Maybe it's up to you
to take things in hand.

55:28.591 --> 55:29.501
Meaning?

55:29.993 --> 55:32.439
To return as head of the family.

55:33.196 --> 55:36.006
You're the one who's paying,
you make the rules.

55:36.833 --> 55:37.937
It's...

55:40.837 --> 55:42.316
Head of the family?

55:42.505 --> 55:46.078
You lay down the law!
You impose your concept of the world.

55:46.276 --> 55:48.187
You set the pace.

55:55.885 --> 56:00.698
We got off to a bad start,
so I've decided to set things straight.

56:00.890 --> 56:02.528
Anything left lying around

56:02.725 --> 56:05.501
will be picked up
by he who left it lying around.

56:06.629 --> 56:08.870
Auguste, you know what
I'm talking about?

56:10.233 --> 56:11.769
We listen to each other.

56:11.968 --> 56:14.141
We talk to each other.
We're a family.

56:14.871 --> 56:15.781
Ok?

56:16.372 --> 56:17.817
As for pocket money...

56:18.575 --> 56:21.784
I thought 200 euros a week,

56:21.978 --> 56:24.049
not a penny more, would be quite...

56:25.548 --> 56:28.529
Maybe 100 euros.
We'll see about that later.

56:29.085 --> 56:29.995
Whatever the case,

56:30.186 --> 56:33.326
if you have any remarks to make,
which would be normal,

56:33.556 --> 56:37.470
a little box, which I shall make myself,
will be put at your disposal.

56:37.660 --> 56:41.403
You'll put your remarks inside
-no spelling mistakes allowed -

56:41.598 --> 56:45.512
and they will be considered in due time
as is appropriate.

56:45.768 --> 56:46.678
There you go.

56:47.604 --> 56:48.878
Everything clear?

56:49.572 --> 56:51.813
So you couldn't live without me?

56:52.008 --> 56:53.043
Not at all.

56:53.776 --> 56:55.722
It was a question of honesty.

56:55.912 --> 56:57.858
I wanted to respect the contract.

56:58.881 --> 57:01.521
It's really great that you came back,

57:01.718 --> 57:04.824
but when it comes to raising the kids,
that's my job.

57:05.021 --> 57:07.934
Yes, but if I'm going to stay
for two more months,

57:08.124 --> 57:10.934
they're my responsibility
for two more months.

57:11.127 --> 57:12.037
Therefore, I am...

57:12.462 --> 57:13.941
the head of the family.

57:16.065 --> 57:17.544
I'm not used to that.

57:18.267 --> 57:19.439
Me either.

57:27.410 --> 57:29.083
Are you going out?

57:29.278 --> 57:30.780
Yes, I have a date.

57:32.615 --> 57:33.719
Nth...

57:34.717 --> 57:35.525
a man?

57:35.718 --> 57:36.924
Yes.

57:38.888 --> 57:39.696
No.

57:40.223 --> 57:41.224
No what?

57:42.992 --> 57:43.936
No.

57:48.297 --> 57:50.777
I understand
you want to take things in hand

57:50.967 --> 57:52.776
and you're doing a good job.

57:53.403 --> 57:55.212
But this isn't about the family.

57:55.405 --> 57:57.248
Could you help me?

57:58.074 --> 57:59.553
This is about...

58:00.076 --> 58:02.454
how can I put it... my personal life.

58:02.645 --> 58:05.057
I'm free,
it's written in the contract.

58:05.682 --> 58:08.458
You don't want to see my family,

58:08.651 --> 58:10.460
so if I can't see my friends...

58:12.755 --> 58:14.325
Yes, but I paid.

58:15.291 --> 58:16.964
Yes, but...

58:17.160 --> 58:18.639
it was very clear that...

58:18.828 --> 58:20.603
I don't know about you,

58:20.797 --> 58:22.470
but I need to live.

58:22.665 --> 58:26.010
I can't hang around here
standing to attention.

58:26.202 --> 58:27.840
Not even for two days.

58:28.037 --> 58:29.641
It's impossible.

58:30.273 --> 58:32.116
So two months, forget it.

58:35.178 --> 58:37.658
I'm not asking for much, you know.

58:37.847 --> 58:39.485
I just want to go out...

58:39.982 --> 58:41.427
see people...

58:41.617 --> 58:42.755
go dancing!

58:44.187 --> 58:45.825
Maybe meet someone.

58:49.459 --> 58:53.703
I don't know how you manage,
but I couldn't stay that long without...

58:57.467 --> 58:59.140
without making love.

58:59.836 --> 59:02.180
And we're not going to make love.

59:05.074 --> 59:07.452
It wasn't stipulated in the contract.

59:11.481 --> 59:12.459
There you go.

59:12.915 --> 59:16.488
There's not a single book
that can replace that.

59:17.086 --> 59:18.622
Try it, you'll see.

59:22.225 --> 59:26.332
Could you say that again?
"it wasn't stipulated in the contract."

59:27.864 --> 59:30.037
It wasn't stipulated in the contract.

59:40.843 --> 59:44.518
I don't know why,
but it really turns me on.

59:49.786 --> 59:51.595
Wait a second.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:49.481
I don't want...

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:52.387
I don't want to take advantage of you.

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:55.558
Besides, I haven't done this in ages.

01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.341
Forgive me.

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.644
I'm sorry, forgive me.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.406
Forgive me.

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.923
I don't believe it.

01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:28.289
- Hey.
- I'll get my things.

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:29.929
Hello, stranger!

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.634
So...

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.337
you coming back to our picnics?

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:42.676
To be honest, I haven't had time
to think about it.

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:44.709
Ok, I'm going.

01:01:47.536 --> 01:01:48.276
Where?

01:01:48.471 --> 01:01:52.214
To Giselle's.
Her cleaning lady is off for the week.

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.945
Then I'll watch Remy's office
for a few hours.

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.020
No.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.683
- Bye.
- Have a nice day, sweetie.

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.697
We need to go grocery shopping.

01:02:07.089 --> 01:02:09.126
So we're going grocery shopping.

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.504
Because we need groceries.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.572
Violet can do what she wants.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:15.868
I think that...

01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:18.407
this is what she wants.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.244
He's not entirely wrong.

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.850
We're a family and we need groceries.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:29.682
You...

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.751
- You're abandoning me?
- No!

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:37.162
It's just that...

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.765
you didn't give me much warning.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.526
And we'd made plans.

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:45.194
I'm your brother.
Do I have to call for an appointment?

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.266
Yes.

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:52.071
We just need to organize things differently
for a while.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.509
Fine, I got it. Bye.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:03.117
We'd agreed?
We said we'd go grocery shopping.

01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:55.164
Is it far? I feel sick.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:56.638
Not in the car.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.351
It's Remy again.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:15.519
He's furious that we're going
to your mother's rather than the picnic.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.493
He says I'm abandoning them.

01:04:20.956 --> 01:04:22.799
He says I'm betraying my family.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.540
- I'm afraid for him.
- Afraid of what?

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:31.609
Watch the road, asshole!

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:38.048
Be careful,
I could lose my license.

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.647
We have to hurry
if we want to stop off at Hotel Tescou.

01:04:42.711 --> 01:04:45.317
Why are we stopping
on the way to your mother's?

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:48.184
Because I decided to.

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.003
Mom?

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:00.071
Can we sing
like when we were kids?

01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:04.242
Sing and heave, and heave and sing,
Hoodah, hoodah!

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:07.846
Heave and make the handspikes spring
Hoodah, hoodah, day!

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:11.541
And it's blow, boys, blow
For Californio!

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.813
There's plenty of gold so I've been told
On the banks of the Sacramento

01:05:16.011 --> 01:05:19.254
From Limehouse Docks to Sydney Heads
Hoodah! hoodah!

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:23.157
Was never more than seventy days
Hoodah, hoodah, day!

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:26.492
And it's blow, boys, blow
For Californio!

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:29.499
There's plenty of gold so I've been told
On the banks of the Sacramento!

01:05:30.392 --> 01:05:33.202
- Where's Paul-Andre?
-He's calling his mother.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.076
Our Seasonal Delights.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.750
We didn't order that, sir.

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:50.415
They're canapxzs, ma'am.

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:55.921
"CanapÃ©s"? I don't understand.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.597
They're starters, Mom.

01:05:59.922 --> 01:06:01.196
It's free, ma'am.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:04.028
That would surprise me.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:08.402
We'll wait for Mr. Delalande
before starting

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:10.577
the "canapÃ©s," as you say.

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:13.374
Very well, ma'am.

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.795
I bet it's Remy.

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.262
He says he hopes we're having fun.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:40.607
Then he says:

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:44.073
"I hope you're enjoying
your newfound social status,

01:06:45.367 --> 01:06:48.507
"which is completely destroying
a united family."

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:50.609
He writes well.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:58.083
I shouldn't have told him
we were eating in a fancy restaurant.

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:03.995
I hope you're proud of us,
we know how to behave in public.

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.696
I'm very proud of you.

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.531
You're very elegant.

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:25.848
- I'd like to make a speech.
-Not too loud, Mom.

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:29.183
Sorry. I'd like to make a speech.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.325
Today...

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:36.728
I'm going to make five wishes.

01:07:37.419 --> 01:07:38.363
Because...

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:42.798
I've had five new experiences
for the first time.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.399
It's the first time that...

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:49.166
anyone has ever
held a door open for me.

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.812
It's the first time that...

01:07:52.768 --> 01:07:54.873
I've been offered "canapÃ©s."

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:59.644
It's the first time that I've seen my kids
in such pretty surroundings.

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:01.417
Thank you.

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:08.490
It's the first time that...

01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:12.228
people call me ma'am all the time
and never argue.

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:15.095
And it's the first time that...

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.270
that...

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.233
Go on.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.113
I realize that I like my life,

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:30.841
because if I were someone else
this never would've happened.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.281
And that would've been a pity.

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.051
Come on.

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.756
This is totally embarrassing.

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:49.265
Thanks, Paul-Andre.
Now I know what being ridiculed means.

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:54.399
- Everyone does it.
- My school principal would never do it.

01:08:54.595 --> 01:08:57.133
Even the minister of interior
wears a bathrobe

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:58.868
to go to the steam room.

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.638
The Dalai Lama too.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:02.877
And the Chinese Emperor.

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.551
There is no more emperor.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.551
Don't worry, kids, the visit
to my mother's won't last forever...

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:11.417
You simply need to grin and bear it...

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.424
and it'll be over in no time!

01:09:14.616 --> 01:09:16.562
Like a visit to the dentist.

01:09:17.252 --> 01:09:19.732
Then it'll be done,
and what's done is done.

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:22.993
And what's done is done
and doesn't need to be done again.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.968
That's the nice part, you move on.
We can do it!

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:28.505
Aren't you supposed to relax
in a steam room?

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.341
I'm relaxed. I'm very relaxed.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:37.679
Will I get all nervous too
when I come to visit you later?

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.250
There's a good chance.

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:42.816
Go France!

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:43.785
Evra!

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.658
He makes a pass to Olivier Giroud!

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.116
Nice shot!

01:09:50.652 --> 01:09:52.359
What field are you in?

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:54.360
The home.

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.166
Interior design?

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.437
No, unemployed.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:09:59.872
At home.

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:05.611
Perhaps you have a personal fortune,
like my son?

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:07.540
Not really.

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.842
Personal misfortune
is unfortunately more like it.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:16.849
I take care of Violet.
Her children are my responsibility.

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:18.351
Excuse me?

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:22.489
Her children are my responsibility,
Mother!

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:25.457
I certainly hope it's temporary.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.501
I put him in a very strict
boarding school

01:10:35.697 --> 01:10:37.404
for family reasons.

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:42.138
I must admit, it didn't help him
become independent.

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.182
We are the way we are.

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.379
It's a goal!

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.015
What's that child doing!

01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.748
Hey you!
Watch out for my ?owers!

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.496
- Auguste!
- I've got it under control!

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:59.666
Responsible for a family...
That takes the cake!

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:05.100
Paul-Andre loved playing mommy and daddy
with Sandra when he was little.

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:10.108
They were this close to marrying!
I'll never understand what happened.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.505
Now they're both alone, like me.

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:18.781
Paul-Andre needs a strong woman

01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:21.580
who can take care of him.

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:24.118
An independent woman.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.217
I'm independent.

01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:32.598
I mean a woman who is truly his equal.

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:36.235
One who isn't motivated by interest,
who doesn't need money.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:37.369
Mother!

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:41.204
Can't I talk about you?

01:11:41.396 --> 01:11:43.103
It's not against the law.

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:53.917
Are you expecting company?

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:54.985
Mother!

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:59.224
Oh, it's Sandra!
She came to renew my prescription.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.053
I have to take care of myself.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:07.400
He shoots! The crowd is going wild!

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:12.502
I apologized, Mom. I said I was sorry.

01:12:12.694 --> 01:12:14.173
I know, sweetheart.

01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:17.970
Come on, Auguste.

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.907
It's nothing serious, Irene.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.638
It'll feel hot, but that's all.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:23.514
What a clumsy boy!

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.114
How are you?

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.512
You haven't changed.

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.949
Thank you. You haven't either.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:33.416
Thanks.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:37.623
Yet if my memory serves me well,

01:12:37.819 --> 01:12:41.926
the world has been rushing inexorably
towards disaster...

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:44.334
-ever since...
- The dawn of time.

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:49.471
- I've heard that one too.
- Daisy...

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.206
Violet.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.507
Bring me a glass of water.

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:55.473
Sure.

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.382
- I'll get it.
-No, that's ok. I've got it.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:09.518
Does nice weather still bother you?

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:12.455
Sometimes, yes.

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:19.873
You should have live-in help, Irene.

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.303
Yes, Sandra, you're right.

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:26.644
- Do you want me to take care of it?
- Sure. I trust you.

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:28.843
Here you go.

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.212
You're very welcome.

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:48.063
Sandra specialized in traumatology.
She's one of the best.

01:13:49.791 --> 01:13:51.065
Traumatology?

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:52.598
WOW!

01:13:52.794 --> 01:13:53.864
That's great!

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.601
What kind of patients do you treat?

01:13:57.799 --> 01:13:59.278
Traumatized ones.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.743
It depends.
Sometimes the elderly...

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:06.215
I also have a degree in sports medicine.

01:14:06.408 --> 01:14:09.878
For the anecdote,
my last patient fractured his knee

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.615
while attempting
to escape from a police van.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:15.424
I've been in a police van.

01:14:15.817 --> 01:14:17.057
Right, Paul-Andre?

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:19.796
A police record
and the whole nine yards!

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.797
That's actually how we met.

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:28.571
A miscarriage of justice, I presume?

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:33.245
Nope, caught in the act.
Assault and battery against a guard.

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:34.880
- Against a what?
-A cop.

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.914
- Then that means you're...
- She's joking.

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:39.585
No, I'm not joking.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.951
Yes, you are. You're joking.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.986
That's right, sorry.

01:14:46.348 --> 01:14:48.726
I'll go for a walk and stop shaming you.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:52.984
Are you ok?

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:54.387
Yes, fine.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:58.193
I warned you.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:00.197
She doesn't like me.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.669
I don't know why, but it's a fact.

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.462
So it always ends badly.

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:08.036
Your mother's not the problem.

01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:10.899
You're the problem.

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:13.636
Me?

01:16:14.903 --> 01:16:16.382
What did I do?

01:16:17.405 --> 01:16:19.476
You're still in love with Sandra.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:22.086
Your mother knows it. She feels it.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.751
I can see it too.

01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:26.721
You don't need a college degree.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.524
What are you talking about?

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.926
It's no big deal. It's the way it is.

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:38.536
She's better for you, it's obvious.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:41.374
She's beautiful...

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.035
she's traumatological...

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:48.537
She doesn't have kids
and she loves you.

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.009
You know...

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.050
when I was a teenager

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.223
and relatively impetuous,

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.926
I often sought refuge in this pavilion.

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:06.091
I liked thinking about the woman
who might one day share my life.

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:08.633
And I said to myself...

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.733
I would love...

01:17:12.727 --> 01:17:14.138
to be here...

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.209
when I told her I loved her.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.441
I think it's a beautiful spot

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.316
to ask someone...

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:29.451
if she wants to share your life,
for better or for worse.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:33.588
And tell her that a young love
won't stand in the way.

01:17:38.753 --> 01:17:41.427
- There's couch grass everywhere.
-Yes, there is.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.600
There's even a tag over there.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:45.904
"Go fun...

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:50.677
An angry teenager, I imagine.

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:57.809
But girls like being told
things like that...

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:00.983
even in strange places.

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:03.813
It's always nice to hear.

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:06.285
You know...

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.692
what I really feared...

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:12.863
wasn't that the girl
wouldn't like the spot...

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.630
but that she wouldn't like me.

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:16.928
Oh yeah?

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:24.008
That would be a very cold-hearted girl.

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.946
- Because...
- Really?

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:57.232
Where's Paul-Andre? What are they doing?

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:59.207
And what's that ringing?

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:00.812
It's Mom's phone.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:04.245
Can't someone please answer'?
It's the umpteenth time!

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:06.851
Go on, answer it. It's killing my ears!

01:19:08.843 --> 01:19:10.880
So you let yourself be bought?

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.081
You let him buy your kids too?

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:16.660
You abandoned me for money?
I found your contract!

01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:19.195
"In exchange for settling her debts

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.594
"and the equivalent of one year's wages,

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.100
'Violet Mandini agrees to make

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:27.364
"Paul-Andre Delalande
part of her family for 3 months!"

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:30.236
You found another crackpot!
I don't believe it!

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:31.274
He paid you

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:32.444
to be his girl?

01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:34.405
You lied to all of us.

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.244
Shit, we trusted you!

01:19:38.606 --> 01:19:41.052
I swear to god, Violet, you disgust me!

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:53.623
What happened?

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.094
She threw a fit.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.292
Lucie?

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.306
What's wrong?

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:05.705
Come on, tell me.

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:07.304
Why did she do this?

01:20:07.502 --> 01:20:10.244
Remy told her you guys had a contract.

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.881
That it was all fake.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:15.885
It's not all fake. It's not.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.446
Lucie...

01:20:17.645 --> 01:20:18.749
Get away from me.

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.626
Is it fake or not?

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:25.991
No.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:29.159
You can tell when feelings are fake.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:31.633
Did you feel like it was fake?

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:33.305
Then that means it's real.

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.940
There's nothing more I can do.
I'll get going.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.013
Here's my card.

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:48.677
You never know.

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:03.496
I'm not getting in the car with him.

01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:06.171
Don't try to mess with me.
It's me or him.

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.670
Paul-Andre, get lost.

01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:12.436
My mom is family, I have to see her.
But not you!

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:19.983
It would've been too complicated anyhow.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.802
I'm sorry for you.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.237
No.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.915
Don't even go there.

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:55.211
Don't pretend you care.

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.817
You don't give a damn
about either Violet or Lucie.

01:21:59.013 --> 01:22:00.651
Or about me for that matter.

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:05.261
It's not my fault
if the poor girl's nerves snapped.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.031
Don't call her "poor girl."

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.202
You almost sound loving.

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:14.737
But you've never been loving.

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.567
That's why I'm not.

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.445
Ok, everything? my fault.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:28.748
What are you doing?

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:30.889
Calling Leon. I want to go home.

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.120
You're leaving right away?
Can't you stay a while?

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:36.919
No, Mother.

01:22:37.819 --> 01:22:39.457
I'll leave you alone.

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:41.463
Because you love being alone.

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:43.465
And I like being alone too.

01:22:45.493 --> 01:22:48.633
You're so much like your father
when you act this way.

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.538
Hello, Leon?

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:57.280
Yes, it's me.

01:22:57.472 --> 01:23:00.612
Could you pick me up at my mother's
as soon as possible?

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:02.147
Thank you.

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:11.722
No, Mother.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.093
Let me do that.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:15.762
I'll do it.

01:25:20.148 --> 01:25:23.391
You have a first client
for your table decorations?

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:28.357
Yes.

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:29.927
A wedding.

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.130
You don't say!

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.907
That's so cool, Mom.

01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.376
A wedding is fantastic.
You must be happy.

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.803
Yes. I'm very, very happy.

01:25:42.503 --> 01:25:44.881
Did you find a name for your company?

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:47.280
No.

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:51.114
It's Tuesday.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.485
I have to file the papers on Tuesday.

01:25:54.515 --> 01:25:58.224
It was Lucie who helped me
with the paperwork.

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.725
She was very sweet.

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:06.832
"Violet's DÃ©co!"

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.006
That's pathetic.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:09.800
You need an English word.

01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:11.738
It would be better.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.935
For example,

01:26:14.135 --> 01:26:15.978
"Violet's Style." How's that?

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:18.673
That's great.
Do you like "Violet's Style"?

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.676
"Wolefs Style..."

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.280
Yes, that's nice.

01:26:25.546 --> 01:26:27.253
I think it's nice.

01:27:06.053 --> 01:27:09.296
You manipulated us!
You played with our feelings!

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:12.164
And what about me?

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:15.798
Did it ever occur to you
for a single second,

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:18.307
that I might be shaken up

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:19.976
b'! my feelings?

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.032
Thank you.

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.537
You don't go out at night anymore.

01:27:50.731 --> 01:27:53.405
I don't have time anymore
with my company.

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:54.773
Yeah, I guess.

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.576
- Hello!
-Hi Lucie!

01:27:57.772 --> 01:28:00.252
There she is. Get a bowl for her.

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:02.614
Hi!

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.957
Thanks.

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:10.390
How's life?

01:28:10.751 --> 01:28:11.593
Great.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.429
Mind telling me where you were?

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.124
At Paul-Andre's.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.296
What?

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.916
I don't know why you came back.
There's no point.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.020
There's always a point.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.681
To coming back?

01:29:13.314 --> 01:29:15.157
It only means leaving again.

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:16.927
Not necessarily.

01:29:19.654 --> 01:29:21.258
You can come back...

01:29:22.156 --> 01:29:23.533
and stay forever.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.472
I don't think so.

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:30.934
That kind of thing never works out.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:34.336
Of course it can workout.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:36.473
We all get along, don't we?

01:29:37.672 --> 01:29:39.174
Mom's right.

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.714
Nothing ever works out.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:52.224
Besides, we're too noisy for you.

01:29:54.221 --> 01:29:55.564
I could...

01:29:55.756 --> 01:29:58.032
I like it when you make noise.

01:29:58.225 --> 01:30:00.227
I think it's great. Honestly.

01:30:00.928 --> 01:30:02.134
You say that now.

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:05.375
What about in three weeks' time?

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:07.978
You'll be fed up. That's the reality.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.348
Right?
In the long run, no one gets along.

01:30:11.539 --> 01:30:13.348
And we're much too messy.

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:15.680
You can't live with people like us.

01:30:15.876 --> 01:30:16.911
It's pure hell.

01:30:17.111 --> 01:30:18.215
Yes.

01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:21.051
What's wrong with all of you?

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:29.262
Whatever? meant to be will be.
You have to trust life.

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.069
We're happy together.

01:30:31.525 --> 01:30:32.196
Aren't we?

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:36.673
We missed each other.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:40.041
Lucie.
We missed each other, right?

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:44.610
We'd be heading straight for disaster.

01:30:44.805 --> 01:30:46.182
That much we know.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:49.546
In the end, you're always alone.

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:50.586
Always.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:53.349
Don't forget the end of the world!

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.760
Yeah, that too.

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:58.859
The end of the world...

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:00.464
It's serious stuff.

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.029
Death period.

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:06.804
We're all heading for death.
That's a fact.

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.302
There's death...

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:09.304
and disease...

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:11.773
Yes! I hadn't thought of that.

01:31:11.966 --> 01:31:14.412
- Very true. It was about time.
- Metastases...

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:16.912
Absolutely. Heart attacks...

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:20.574
- Heart attacks!
- It could happen any time.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:23.813
I think it would be better
to end it all now.

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:27.758
- It's the surest thing.
- Maybe you're right. Good idea.

01:31:27.948 --> 01:31:29.825
I agree, there's no point in...

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.930
- On top of it, the sun's out.
- Oh my god!

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.066
The sun's out. How horrible!

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:37.600
It's so depressing when the sun's out.

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:39.399
You think it'll last?

01:31:40.194 --> 01:31:42.003
Yes. For the rest of your lives.

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.732
How horrible!

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.335
What'll we do?
