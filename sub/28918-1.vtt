02:04.411 --> 02:07.211
Ready? Go.

02:22.633 --> 02:25.170
Hello.

02:27.972 --> 02:31.109
I guess you don't take
the card under a tenner, right?

05:19.042 --> 05:20.307
Hi.

05:20.309 --> 05:22.846
What do you want?

05:24.981 --> 05:26.280
Nice to see you too.

05:26.282 --> 05:27.915
I don't know.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.052
To check up on you?

05:30.054 --> 05:32.253
You came here
to check up on me?

05:32.255 --> 05:34.825
I'm worried about you.

05:35.825 --> 05:38.160
You look tired.

05:38.162 --> 05:40.696
Stop, Chloe.

05:40.698 --> 05:42.633
What do you really want?

05:45.736 --> 05:48.373
The final part of Paranoia
starts today.

05:49.707 --> 05:51.840
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

05:51.842 --> 05:54.109
We're only one level short
of entering the game.

05:54.111 --> 05:55.777
Only one puzzle
left to solve.

05:55.779 --> 05:57.979
- Get out of here.
- I'm sure you can solve it.

05:57.981 --> 05:59.980
No one's ever been as far as you
in Paranoia.

05:59.982 --> 06:01.950
I don't give a shit.

06:01.952 --> 06:03.417
Do you understand?

06:03.419 --> 06:04.986
It's all over, Chloe.

06:04.988 --> 06:06.388
Are you listening to me?

06:06.390 --> 06:10.725
- It all begins today.
- No, you listen to me.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.893
I haven't seen your face
in months,

06:12.895 --> 06:15.097
and the first thing
you want to do is come in here

06:15.099 --> 06:16.864
and talk to me
about this bullshit.

06:16.866 --> 06:20.167
We spent a year 24/7 sitting in
front of our computers,

06:20.169 --> 06:24.773
searching for a lead,
for nothing.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.907
You're not interested in
the million-euro prize?

06:26.909 --> 06:30.378
I don't want to go back to
that place. It destroyed us.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.984
You know that's
not what destroyed us.

07:35.111 --> 07:38.515
Just think of what the two of us
could do with a million euros.

07:40.116 --> 07:42.018
The two of us?

07:43.554 --> 07:46.821
I read an article in the paper
about two black swans

07:46.823 --> 07:49.357
that disappeared from the zoo
in Manchester.

07:49.359 --> 07:50.958
Two black swans.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.261
That's the emblem
of Paranoia.

07:54.263 --> 07:56.263
That's just a coincidence.

07:56.265 --> 07:59.867
Except that the zoo never had
any black swans.

07:59.869 --> 08:02.871
I checked it out.

08:02.873 --> 08:05.840
- That is weird.
- I wrote to the zoo.

08:05.842 --> 08:07.508
I got a message back:

08:07.510 --> 08:09.511
"24 be careful."

08:09.513 --> 08:11.782
"24 be careful,"
that must be a code.

08:19.155 --> 08:22.425
Twenty... okay, two numbers,
two words.

08:24.594 --> 08:26.994
Could tell you the zip code.

08:26.996 --> 08:30.198
So let's just assume
A equals 1, B equals 2,

08:30.200 --> 08:32.032
C equals 3,
D equals 4.

08:32.034 --> 08:35.270
You get 24,
which equals BD.

08:35.272 --> 08:37.407
What is it, "Be careful"?

08:40.376 --> 08:46.180
First letter of each words
are B and C, which is 23.

08:46.182 --> 08:49.820
So you get BD23.

08:51.254 --> 08:53.487
There you go, the home page
of Skipton City,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.890
zip code: BD23.

08:55.892 --> 08:58.293
"Preservation
of our ecosystem"...

08:58.295 --> 09:00.060
"Protection of the black swan."

09:00.062 --> 09:02.296
This is it.
"A year on the road

09:02.298 --> 09:04.966
"brings us back
to the same place, as always.

09:04.968 --> 09:08.005
We'll be there tonight
until midnight."

09:09.205 --> 09:11.472
What does it mean?

09:11.474 --> 09:13.909
"A year on the road
brings us back..."

09:13.911 --> 09:17.181
Type in "01"
into the first box.

09:18.382 --> 09:21.484
"Brings us back
to the same place...

09:22.386 --> 09:24.288
as always."

09:25.989 --> 09:27.322
Try the infinity symbol.

09:27.324 --> 09:30.628
"We'll be there tonight
until midnight."

09:32.662 --> 09:35.166
Type today's date: 0811.

09:38.234 --> 09:39.501
It's not working.

09:39.503 --> 09:42.172
Okay, go back.

09:43.272 --> 09:45.640
"A year on the road..."

09:45.642 --> 09:48.510
01 again.

09:48.512 --> 09:53.113
Let's try 00
instead of the infinity.

09:53.115 --> 09:55.186
08...

09:56.585 --> 09:59.353
You've got it.
A rave in Skipton.

09:59.355 --> 10:01.222
You're a genius.

10:01.224 --> 10:03.094
Let's find it.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.406
Mum?

10:25.715 --> 10:28.551
Please, may I ask you
something?

10:35.492 --> 10:38.529
You're not going to like
what I'm about to tell you.

10:42.099 --> 10:46.034
But I'm going to go for a ride
with Chloe tonight,

10:46.036 --> 10:47.705
if that's okay.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.338
I know what you're thinking,

10:51.340 --> 10:55.443
that she's hurt me
too much, and.

10:55.445 --> 10:56.778
Please can you just
forgive me

10:56.780 --> 10:59.050
for still being in love
with her?

11:07.523 --> 11:11.059
Sorry, I'm going to have to
clean my car one of these days.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.229
You can put that in the back
if you want.

11:21.171 --> 11:24.208
No rave in sight so far.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.116
- There.
- Where?

11:36.118 --> 11:38.288
There, over there,
I can see it.

12:24.835 --> 12:26.634
I don't get it.

12:26.636 --> 12:28.569
If we're on
Paranoia's playground,

12:28.571 --> 12:29.838
who's running the show?

12:29.840 --> 12:33.107
Like, who's paying
for all this?

12:33.109 --> 12:34.741
And who are
all these people?

12:34.743 --> 12:37.748
Like, are they real partiers
or are they part of the game?

12:55.232 --> 12:58.433
Shit. Naomi's here.

12:58.435 --> 13:00.568
I'm guessing she's still
in the game then.

13:00.570 --> 13:01.568
More than ever.

13:01.570 --> 13:02.904
But if she's here,

13:02.906 --> 13:04.872
that means
we're on the right track.

13:04.874 --> 13:07.544
Come on, let's find Paranoia's
entrance before she does.

13:09.646 --> 13:11.545
- Can you hear that?
- What?

13:11.547 --> 13:13.280
The music of Swan Lake.

13:14.484 --> 13:16.650
- That's techno.
- No, no, no, no.

13:16.652 --> 13:18.785
It's in the distance.
It's...

13:18.787 --> 13:20.657
It's further. Come on.

13:51.555 --> 13:54.191
What the hell.

14:06.402 --> 14:08.770
You are late.

14:08.772 --> 14:11.305
There is only one joystick.

14:11.307 --> 14:15.742
- How do we play each other?
- We play against the computer.

14:15.744 --> 14:17.914
- Do you want to go first?
- No, thanks.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.661
Ah...

14:33.596 --> 14:35.431
Go, go, go, go, go.

14:36.766 --> 14:38.702
Shit.

14:43.706 --> 14:45.341
Your turn.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.947
Round one.

14:52.949 --> 14:54.748
Fight.

15:05.628 --> 15:07.565
Yes!

15:12.902 --> 15:15.937
You should hurry up.
You still have a long way to go.

15:15.939 --> 15:18.872
So, where are we going now?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.842
Okay there's
the GPS coordinates.

15:20.844 --> 15:22.646
Let me check.

15:27.050 --> 15:28.652
Got it.

16:26.042 --> 16:28.108
There's Paranoia.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.647
Looks like it.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.627
They're waiting for you.

18:14.117 --> 18:15.849
There's cameras everywhere.

18:15.851 --> 18:17.518
It's normal.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.656
They have to monitor the game.

18:39.175 --> 18:42.242
Sorry, guys,
we started without you.

18:42.244 --> 18:43.743
Welcome anyway.

18:43.745 --> 18:45.078
I am Ray.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.615
I'm Maxine.

18:47.617 --> 18:49.183
Jablowski.

18:49.185 --> 18:51.485
I'm Chloe.

18:51.487 --> 18:55.088
So you're back in the game?

18:55.090 --> 18:58.128
I haven't seen you online
for a while.

19:02.999 --> 19:06.067
Welcome to Paranoia,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:06.069 --> 19:09.036
First of all, we wish
to congratulate you.

19:09.038 --> 19:10.671
Of the thousands of hopefuls,

19:10.673 --> 19:13.107
only you made it
all the way here.

19:13.109 --> 19:15.675
This competition
was created for you.

19:15.677 --> 19:18.779
It will push your abilities
to the limit.

19:18.781 --> 19:22.884
It will exploit your weaknesses
and test you like never before.

19:22.886 --> 19:25.118
This hospital
is your playground.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.053
It's furthermost recesses,

19:27.055 --> 19:28.822
it's darkest corners,

19:28.824 --> 19:31.192
are yours for the entire
duration of the game.

19:31.194 --> 19:34.828
You're about to play
a gigantic escape game.

19:34.830 --> 19:37.597
You'll need to solve puzzles
to get out of each room

19:37.599 --> 19:38.933
and move on
to the next level.

19:38.935 --> 19:41.202
Every time you exit a room,

19:41.204 --> 19:43.003
you will be given a piece
of the puzzle.

19:43.005 --> 19:47.040
You've already found the first
piece on the table.

19:47.042 --> 19:49.844
Once complete, the puzzle
will reveal the combination

19:49.846 --> 19:52.245
to the exit
of the hospital.

19:52.247 --> 19:54.682
You have been divided
into teams of two.

19:54.684 --> 19:56.817
The first team
to exit the hospital

19:56.819 --> 20:00.687
wins the million-euro prize.

20:00.689 --> 20:03.124
Be aware that you will not
be allowed to leave the game

20:03.126 --> 20:05.225
once it has begun.

20:05.227 --> 20:08.128
Finally, does anyone among you
want to give up and leave now?

20:08.130 --> 20:10.330
This is your last chance.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.217
Chloe?

21:16.331 --> 21:17.831
As you can see,

21:17.833 --> 21:20.067
you are all isolated
to start the game.

21:20.069 --> 21:23.236
Now, you must find your teammate
to stay in the game.

21:23.238 --> 21:27.407
Three, two, one.

21:27.409 --> 21:29.679
Go.

23:03.138 --> 23:05.172
Chloe?

23:05.174 --> 23:06.773
Chloe, can you hear me?

23:06.775 --> 23:09.242
Lucas? Lucas, I can hear you.

23:09.244 --> 23:11.244
There's a vent connecting
our two rooms.

23:11.246 --> 23:13.780
- Do you see it?
- Yeah, I see it.

23:13.782 --> 23:15.950
I found a key, but it doesn't
open any locks.

23:15.952 --> 23:17.885
Does it fit the door?

23:17.887 --> 23:20.020
It doesn't have a lock.

23:20.022 --> 23:22.458
Does it have a metal plate
on it too?

23:23.525 --> 23:25.291
No, not even.

23:25.293 --> 23:28.098
How am I supposed to open
this fucking door?

23:32.001 --> 23:34.033
Okay, right.
Chloe, I've got it, okay?

23:34.035 --> 23:36.436
If you can't open it,
then it has to be me.

23:36.438 --> 23:39.408
I need you to throw
the key down, is that okay?

23:53.856 --> 23:55.422
Done.

24:00.329 --> 24:02.398
No, it's not far enough.

24:05.935 --> 24:08.739
I've got it, I've got it.
Okay, wait there, Chloe.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.460
Hey.

24:36.299 --> 24:38.033
Okay, let's go.

24:42.205 --> 24:44.340
Okay, now look for Room 7.

25:13.034 --> 25:14.838
Here.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.882
Okay.

25:27.884 --> 25:31.021
Whoa, what is this place?

25:35.323 --> 25:37.057
Okay, so, I mean,

25:37.059 --> 25:39.225
I'm guessing we have to exit
back through this door?

25:39.227 --> 25:40.493
And there's a keypad here,

25:40.495 --> 25:42.495
so we need to find
some sort of code.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.009
Do you think we have
to put this thing on?

25:58.214 --> 26:00.247
Yes.

26:00.249 --> 26:02.282
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

26:02.284 --> 26:04.617
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

26:04.619 --> 26:07.389
Come on, don't be a pussy.
Help me into it.

26:19.601 --> 26:21.237
Okay.

26:24.674 --> 26:27.040
Okay, now look around.

26:27.042 --> 26:29.378
There must be a riddle
that we have to solve.

26:33.115 --> 26:34.885
Oh, no.

26:38.020 --> 26:40.924
Okay, no, no, no, no.
I don't like this at all, Chloe.

26:42.558 --> 26:44.959
Don't move.

26:44.961 --> 26:46.930
We need to get
out of here now.

26:48.330 --> 26:50.497
What do we do if I can't
get out in time?

26:50.499 --> 26:52.566
Don't come.

26:52.568 --> 26:54.667
Find the riddle.

26:54.669 --> 26:56.672
Hurry.

27:00.609 --> 27:04.243
Okay, it looks like a puzzle,
so I think...

27:04.245 --> 27:06.113
some of the pieces
are black on the back,

27:06.115 --> 27:09.085
so I'm going to have to make
some sort of pattern here.

27:15.457 --> 27:18.358
Here we go.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.129
Oh, my God.

27:23.131 --> 27:25.034
Okay.

27:30.071 --> 27:32.138
- What are you doing?
- Look, it's taking shape.

27:32.140 --> 27:34.707
I don't understand. You can see
the swan here, Chloe.

27:34.709 --> 27:38.345
Well, you must be doing
something wrong.

27:38.347 --> 27:40.414
I can't, Chloe. I give up.
It's too dangerous.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.750
- No, no, no, no,
- I'm going to try to untie you.

27:42.752 --> 27:45.251
No! Finish the swan.

27:45.253 --> 27:46.520
Finish the swan.
Trust me.

27:46.522 --> 27:48.590
I can see something.

27:51.159 --> 27:52.393
Keep doing it.

27:52.395 --> 27:54.060
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

27:54.062 --> 27:58.001
Lucas, one minute left.
Make the fucking swan.

28:01.036 --> 28:04.570
I can see numbers.
I can see numbers.

28:04.572 --> 28:07.310
I need the blades to come closer
to me, to read them.

28:11.781 --> 28:13.579
God.

28:13.581 --> 28:15.318
Oh, God.

28:20.488 --> 28:21.821
Okay, Lucas.

28:21.823 --> 28:23.523
Lucas, I got it.
I see it.

28:23.525 --> 28:26.626
First row: 5, 30 and 6.

28:26.628 --> 28:28.194
Second row: 3...

28:28.196 --> 28:30.500
the one in the middle
is missing, and then...

28:32.167 --> 28:33.834
number 7.

28:33.836 --> 28:36.436
Okay, so we need to find
the missing number.

28:36.438 --> 28:38.137
Lucas, ten seconds left!

28:38.139 --> 28:39.807
Five times six is 30.
Okay, I've got it.

28:39.809 --> 28:41.207
So 5x6 is 30,

28:41.209 --> 28:42.709
3x7 is 21.

28:42.711 --> 28:44.344
So we got here,
we got...

28:44.346 --> 28:47.481
5, 30, 6, 3, 21, 7.

28:47.483 --> 28:49.284
Okay, got it.

28:57.459 --> 29:01.096
Chloe, what the fuck
are we doing here?

29:03.698 --> 29:06.535
Fucking psychos.

29:08.570 --> 29:10.537
Now look for Room 11.
Let's go.

29:10.539 --> 29:12.673
- Chloe...
- Come on!

29:12.675 --> 29:15.675
Chloe, can't you see there's
something wrong with this place?

29:15.677 --> 29:17.310
Chloe!

29:17.312 --> 29:19.282
Are you listening to me?

29:36.465 --> 29:38.234
Help!

29:39.368 --> 29:41.070
Help!

29:43.738 --> 29:45.841
Is anyone out there?

29:50.478 --> 29:52.215
Shit.

30:09.732 --> 30:11.665
What's the number
of the room again?

30:11.667 --> 30:13.336
Eleven.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.702
Ah! Damn it!

30:15.704 --> 30:18.172
Damn it.

30:18.174 --> 30:20.741
They're ahead of us now.

30:20.743 --> 30:22.576
Well...

30:22.578 --> 30:23.876
okay, well, let's look.

30:23.878 --> 30:25.479
Let's try another room.

30:25.481 --> 30:27.713
Maybe we can get
into the game again from there?

30:31.186 --> 30:32.621
Can you hear that?

30:37.525 --> 30:39.528
No, wait,
it's coming from this way.

30:51.907 --> 30:54.444
Shit, shit!

31:14.495 --> 31:15.995
Do you think the game
continues here?

31:15.997 --> 31:18.799
I don't know.
Let's look for clues.

31:18.801 --> 31:20.399
And let's not waste any time.

31:20.401 --> 31:22.836
I don't want the others
to destroy us.

31:22.838 --> 31:26.242
Okay, let's take a look
at the bookshelf over there.

31:34.949 --> 31:37.283
Do you know
your classical music?

31:37.285 --> 31:38.719
A little bit. You?

31:38.721 --> 31:40.390
No.

31:42.023 --> 31:43.892
There's a padlock here.

31:46.628 --> 31:49.663
There's a Swan Lake score
on every shelf.

31:49.665 --> 31:51.330
So there's three shelves.

31:51.332 --> 31:53.767
And that bottom lock's
three digits, right?

31:53.769 --> 31:55.601
- Yeah.
- Okay so the first shelf

31:55.603 --> 31:57.537
is fourth position.

31:57.539 --> 31:59.806
- Four...
- The second shelf is seventh position,

31:59.808 --> 32:01.974
- Seven...
- And the third shelf

32:01.976 --> 32:06.280
is ninth position.

32:06.282 --> 32:07.681
It's not working.

32:07.683 --> 32:09.482
Oh, God.

32:12.987 --> 32:16.359
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There is a score marked "479."

32:17.592 --> 32:19.795
Chopin's Ballad in G minor.

32:21.964 --> 32:23.997
Are they trying
to kill us here or what?

32:23.999 --> 32:26.767
- Hurry.
- Look for an Irish composer.

32:26.769 --> 32:29.302
- Why Irish?
- Ireland's missing on that map.

32:29.304 --> 32:31.738
Okay. Albert Ketelbey?

32:31.740 --> 32:32.938
English.

32:32.940 --> 32:36.443
- Learmont Drysdale?
- Scottish.

32:36.445 --> 32:38.678
Oh, my God.
Oh, there is a book here.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.446
The Purloined Letter.

32:40.448 --> 32:41.815
Edgar Allan Poe.

32:41.817 --> 32:43.016
He's Irish, right?

32:43.018 --> 32:45.655
No, he's American.

32:47.723 --> 32:49.955
We need to find an exit now.
We need to go.

32:49.957 --> 32:52.059
Okay, this one, this one.
Breve Deliran?

32:52.061 --> 32:53.693
You know this composer?

32:53.695 --> 32:54.895
No.

32:54.897 --> 32:56.096
On, wait, Deliran.

32:56.098 --> 32:58.565
Deliran is an anagram
for Ireland.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.399
And Breve?
What is Breve?

33:00.401 --> 33:02.034
Double whole note.

33:02.036 --> 33:05.605
- So it's in the score?
- Okay, let me check the pages.

33:05.607 --> 33:08.774
Okay, page four
is six breves.

33:08.776 --> 33:12.346
- Six...
- Page seven is three breves.

33:12.348 --> 33:13.680
Three.

33:13.682 --> 33:15.415
And page nine is eight breves.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.853
Six-three-eight.
It's working, it's working.

33:21.622 --> 33:23.589
It's gonna take us ages
to go through all this.

33:23.591 --> 33:24.957
- Calm down.
- The room's on fire.

33:24.959 --> 33:26.992
- Then solve the riddle.
- What riddle, Chloe?

33:26.994 --> 33:28.895
I don't even know
if this is part of it.

33:28.897 --> 33:31.431
- Maybe we're stuck in here.
- I got it, I got it.

33:34.369 --> 33:36.903
- How is your Spanish?
- The pianist, where did he go?

33:36.905 --> 33:38.571
Lucas!

33:38.573 --> 33:41.540
- My Spanish is terrible. Yours?
- Same.

33:41.542 --> 33:42.809
So, what do we do then?

33:42.811 --> 33:44.813
I don't know.

33:47.515 --> 33:50.585
You're the fucking whiz kid.
You find it, get us out of here.

33:52.087 --> 33:53.886
The Purloined Letter.

33:53.888 --> 33:56.559
- What?
- The Purloined Letter.

34:01.163 --> 34:02.899
Oh...

34:04.699 --> 34:06.335
Uh...

34:21.949 --> 34:23.618
Look.

34:39.634 --> 34:42.938
How did you find out we had
to finish the piano piece?

34:44.440 --> 34:47.107
Well, as Poe said
in The Purloined Letter,

34:47.109 --> 34:49.108
you know, the best place
to hide a treasure

34:49.110 --> 34:50.710
is the most conspicuous place,

34:50.712 --> 34:52.679
because people won't think
to search there.

34:52.681 --> 34:54.447
It's too obvious,
you know?

34:54.449 --> 34:56.449
So they're looking
for more intricate leads.

34:56.451 --> 34:59.719
So Ireland and all the other
places are just false leads.

34:59.721 --> 35:01.721
And the most conspicuous thing
was the piano.

35:01.723 --> 35:03.523
Of course.

35:03.525 --> 35:05.461
What do the papers say?

35:06.929 --> 35:09.898
"We are equal
in the face of it."

35:11.567 --> 35:13.136
The law?

35:25.781 --> 35:27.417
Death?

35:45.667 --> 35:49.138
Don't tell me this
is what I think it is.

36:09.558 --> 36:10.757
What the fuck?

36:20.201 --> 36:22.969
The keypad.

36:22.971 --> 36:25.672
The keypad is more complicated
this time.

36:25.674 --> 36:30.179
Digits from 0 to 9
and letters from A to F.

36:55.603 --> 36:58.672
Seems like a normal deck.
I think all the cards are here.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.942
That's one, two, three...

37:06.648 --> 37:07.947
What, what?

37:07.949 --> 37:10.050
- Oh, my God.
- Chloe, what?

37:10.052 --> 37:11.754
What?

37:18.060 --> 37:20.893
Calm down, okay?
Calm down, it's okay.

37:20.895 --> 37:22.631
Could just be a false alarm.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.835
It's okay.

37:34.842 --> 37:36.809
Is that part of the game?

37:38.179 --> 37:40.315
It's okay.
It's okay, calm down.

37:41.817 --> 37:43.382
What is this fucking place?

37:49.857 --> 37:52.661
- Okay, go and get the tables.
- Okay, okay, okay.

38:01.036 --> 38:02.738
Okay, hold the door, Chloe.

38:10.378 --> 38:12.014
Hurry, Lucas!

38:22.290 --> 38:24.226
Hurry!

38:34.869 --> 38:36.835
I'm coming, okay.
Turn this to the side

38:36.837 --> 38:38.239
and put it by the door.

38:40.976 --> 38:43.442
No! Fuck!
Do you remember the code?

38:43.444 --> 38:48.280
Try C... C-A-2-1-9-9.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.983
Okay, hurry up, Chloe.

38:50.985 --> 38:55.056
- That's not working.
- C-A-2-1-0-7.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.328
That's it! Come on!

39:02.029 --> 39:05.230
I managed to grab the puzzle
piece but not the paper.

39:05.232 --> 39:07.766
Shit, where do we go now?

39:09.203 --> 39:11.070
He's still after us,
this fucking freak.

39:11.072 --> 39:13.139
Okay, go, go, go, go.

39:15.243 --> 39:18.047
- How do we get out?
- This way, this way, this way.

39:30.726 --> 39:32.358
This place is a labyrinth.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.096
The door.

39:35.730 --> 39:37.831
Lucas? Lucas!

39:37.833 --> 39:39.032
Lucas!

39:39.034 --> 39:40.333
Chloe?

39:40.335 --> 39:42.101
Don't leave me here!

39:42.103 --> 39:43.503
I can't get the door open!

39:45.406 --> 39:47.942
Chloe! Chloe!

39:50.478 --> 39:52.247
Chloe!

40:43.264 --> 40:44.900
Help, help.

40:45.833 --> 40:48.333
Help! Somebody come.

40:48.335 --> 40:51.873
No, no, no, no, no, no.

40:55.310 --> 40:57.543
Did you know that
our memory skills improve

40:57.545 --> 40:59.846
when we understand
that every mistake we make

40:59.848 --> 41:01.346
results in punishment?

41:01.348 --> 41:03.983
Like when your parents
spanked you when you were wrong?

41:03.985 --> 41:05.818
You're about to experience it.

41:05.820 --> 41:07.052
Please just leave me alone.

41:07.054 --> 41:09.322
Please, leave me alone,
you psychos.

41:09.324 --> 41:10.924
We will measure the extent

41:10.926 --> 41:13.159
to which punishment
can affect memory.

41:13.161 --> 41:15.962
I will give you a series
of 11 word pairs.

41:15.964 --> 41:18.463
A noun, followed by
an adjective.

41:18.465 --> 41:20.300
Then I will give you
the adjective,

41:20.302 --> 41:22.902
and you will tell me
the noun it refers to.

41:22.904 --> 41:25.938
We will repeat the process
ten times in total.

41:25.940 --> 41:28.407
Every mistake
will be punished.

41:28.409 --> 41:32.110
A minimum of five correct
answers will set you free.

41:32.112 --> 41:34.917
What if I don't get
five correct answers?

41:35.851 --> 41:37.983
Mind, sick.

41:37.985 --> 41:41.154
Corpse, cold.

41:41.156 --> 41:43.056
Cross, black.

41:43.058 --> 41:45.458
Dungeon, dark.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.994
Mother, mystery.

41:47.996 --> 41:50.163
Circle, colored.

41:50.165 --> 41:53.099
Treasure, buried.

41:53.101 --> 41:55.601
Soul, flying.

41:55.603 --> 41:58.170
Presence, absent.

41:58.172 --> 42:00.639
Wind, violent.

42:00.641 --> 42:03.945
Murderer, innocent.

42:09.317 --> 42:11.085
Dark.

42:12.286 --> 42:14.587
Dungeon.

42:14.589 --> 42:15.954
Correct.

42:15.956 --> 42:18.194
Next word: flying.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.293
Sky.

42:21.295 --> 42:23.195
Wrong.

42:33.641 --> 42:35.243
Mystery.

42:37.177 --> 42:39.945
I repeat. Mystery.

42:43.083 --> 42:45.117
- Chloe...
- Wrong.

42:51.493 --> 42:54.596
Next word: colored.

42:59.034 --> 43:01.199
Circle.

43:01.201 --> 43:02.969
Correct.

43:02.971 --> 43:05.474
Next word: violent.

43:08.976 --> 43:10.242
- I don't know.
- Wrong.

43:18.520 --> 43:22.355
It seems like you have
a masochistic streak.

43:22.357 --> 43:24.056
Well, I have some good news:

43:24.058 --> 43:26.625
the shocks will keep
getting stronger.

43:26.627 --> 43:29.027
Next word: cold.

43:29.029 --> 43:30.462
I don't know.

43:30.464 --> 43:31.965
Wrong.

43:49.317 --> 43:51.650
Next word: sick.

43:51.652 --> 43:55.554
Take your time to make sure
you give me the correct answer.

43:55.556 --> 43:57.155
Concentrate.

43:57.157 --> 43:59.092
- Your voice sounds familiar.
- Wrong.

44:08.369 --> 44:10.636
You only have
three questions left.

44:10.638 --> 44:12.505
This is your last chance.

44:12.507 --> 44:14.773
As you've now already given
five incorrect answers,

44:14.775 --> 44:17.275
you have no room
for error now.

44:19.647 --> 44:22.648
Next word: murderer.

44:22.650 --> 44:25.117
Guilty.

44:25.119 --> 44:27.253
Finish him off.

44:27.255 --> 44:28.958
No, no, no...

44:42.103 --> 44:44.306
[electricity crackles

48:23.824 --> 48:25.527
Chloe, it's me.

48:31.898 --> 48:34.335
You should never have said yes
this morning.

48:35.670 --> 48:38.804
We wouldn't have found the rave.

48:38.806 --> 48:42.543
We wouldn't be locked up
in a fucking nuthouse.

48:44.045 --> 48:45.478
Chloe?

48:47.581 --> 48:51.252
Why didn't you tell me you spent
time in a psychiatric hospital?

48:55.889 --> 48:59.458
I didn't want you to think
I was crazy.

48:59.460 --> 49:04.029
Someone would hang crosses
on my door.

49:04.031 --> 49:06.299
Every day, for months.

49:06.301 --> 49:07.967
Every single day.

49:07.969 --> 49:09.934
I never found out
who it was.

49:09.936 --> 49:13.275
And then it got to me.

49:15.909 --> 49:18.379
And I fell into
a depression, and...

49:20.315 --> 49:23.351
ended up in a mental hospital.

49:24.319 --> 49:27.085
When I came out,

49:27.087 --> 49:29.023
the crosses reappeared.

49:30.958 --> 49:32.793
So I moved out.

49:35.496 --> 49:38.096
Things have been
pretty hectic for me

49:38.098 --> 49:39.864
since we broke up,
you know.

49:39.866 --> 49:41.500
Since broke up, you mean.

49:41.502 --> 49:43.639
You forced me
to break up.

49:49.110 --> 49:52.614
How come you never told me
about how your mother died?

50:02.489 --> 50:04.659
I was 16, and...

50:08.496 --> 50:10.029
she was killed
by burglars.

50:11.866 --> 50:13.532
I was at a party,

50:13.534 --> 50:17.369
and I got so drunk
that I came home

50:17.371 --> 50:19.505
and I passed out,
and I didn't hear anything.

50:19.507 --> 50:22.775
I didn't hear them coming in.

50:22.777 --> 50:25.076
I didn't hear them
killing my mother.

50:25.078 --> 50:26.714
Nothing.

50:28.482 --> 50:30.449
She must have cried for help,
you know?

50:30.451 --> 50:32.951
She must have thought I was
going to come around the corner

50:32.953 --> 50:34.989
and I was going to save her.

50:39.393 --> 50:40.962
I just feel so guilty.

50:42.897 --> 50:45.463
And they were searching
for something in the basement.

50:45.465 --> 50:47.065
I don't...

50:47.067 --> 50:48.900
I don't know what it was,

50:48.902 --> 50:51.872
but it must have been something
important, you know, to her.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.742
But they never
went to the basement.

50:56.744 --> 50:59.614
I always wanted to go down
into the basement, you know?

51:00.882 --> 51:03.118
But I never did,
because I just...

51:04.886 --> 51:06.518
I felt like I was
betraying her.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.723
Lucas.

51:13.527 --> 51:15.628
Lucas.

51:15.630 --> 51:17.898
I'm sorry.

51:35.715 --> 51:37.152
Ow.

51:41.589 --> 51:43.157
Check this out.

51:44.659 --> 51:46.895
Looks like Naomi.

51:48.161 --> 51:50.098
Wait, was she a patient here?

51:52.199 --> 51:54.467
It's written on her file.

51:54.469 --> 51:56.101
"Dangerous patient."

51:56.103 --> 52:00.142
She looks like 16 or 17 there.
It must have been ages ago.

52:07.148 --> 52:08.813
Look what's written.

52:08.815 --> 52:11.217
"Keep away from sharp objects,

52:11.219 --> 52:14.152
pens, keys, screwdriver."

52:14.154 --> 52:16.889
Maxine had a screwdriver
stuck in her throat, remember?

52:16.891 --> 52:18.791
She was probably
committed here

52:18.793 --> 52:20.826
when she was a teenager
for other issues,

52:20.828 --> 52:23.996
but now she wants revenge from
all the years she was locked up.

52:23.998 --> 52:26.931
And she wants to take it out
on innocent gamers?

52:26.933 --> 52:28.266
No, I don't believe that.

52:28.268 --> 52:29.902
I'm serious, Lucas.

52:29.904 --> 52:33.739
I'm sure it's her.

52:33.741 --> 52:37.809
We need to get one more piece,
then we've completed the puzzle.

52:37.811 --> 52:39.748
Come on, let's take this.
Let's go.

53:32.766 --> 53:35.569
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

53:36.871 --> 53:39.840
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

53:45.645 --> 53:47.848
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

54:01.127 --> 54:03.728
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

54:11.973 --> 54:13.639
I can't believe it.

54:13.641 --> 54:16.711
He was right there
in front of us the whole time.

54:19.380 --> 54:22.181
Wait, wait, wait. I don't think
that's coming towards us.

54:22.183 --> 54:24.116
I think that's going away.

54:24.118 --> 54:25.820
Jablowski.

54:29.889 --> 54:31.326
Is Naomi not with you?

54:32.960 --> 54:34.960
No, she disappeared
a while ago.

54:34.962 --> 54:36.862
Did you guys see what happened
to Maxine?

54:36.864 --> 54:38.963
Yeah.

54:38.965 --> 54:41.065
And Ray got killed too.

54:41.067 --> 54:42.333
What?

54:42.335 --> 54:45.837
When was the last time
you saw Naomi?

54:45.839 --> 54:48.306
She opened the door after we
solved a riddle and walked out.

54:48.308 --> 54:50.208
When I went out after her,
she was gone.

54:50.210 --> 54:52.777
Was that before or after
what happened to Maxine?

54:52.779 --> 54:54.913
Before.
I wasn't with her anymore

54:54.915 --> 54:57.049
when I found
Maxine's body.

54:57.051 --> 55:00.119
- Did you know Naomi before you came here?
- Why all these questions?

55:00.121 --> 55:02.221
Because she was a patient
here ten years ago.

55:02.223 --> 55:04.422
You kidding me?

55:04.424 --> 55:06.157
What's that all about?

55:06.159 --> 55:08.027
It's about a psycho
killing escape gamers

55:08.029 --> 55:10.262
- with a screwdriver.
- Hang on, maybe she's dead too.

55:10.264 --> 55:12.163
You know, that's just how
the game goes.

55:12.165 --> 55:13.965
The game?

55:13.967 --> 55:16.235
This isn't about a game anymore,
do you not understand?

55:16.237 --> 55:19.137
This is about a fucking killer
chasing us down hallways.

55:19.139 --> 55:22.875
The game is still on,
and we are opponents.

55:22.877 --> 55:24.143
What?

55:24.145 --> 55:25.744
That doesn't make sense,
Jablowski.

55:25.746 --> 55:27.146
We're stronger as a team,
surely.

55:27.148 --> 55:29.047
Yeah, good luck!

55:39.460 --> 55:41.192
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

55:41.194 --> 55:42.960
What could that mean?

55:42.962 --> 55:44.797
I don't know.

55:44.799 --> 55:48.000
Maybe the next level is taking
us outside in the daylight.

55:48.002 --> 55:50.735
Yeah, it's clever,
but it's just...

55:50.737 --> 55:52.170
It's too religious.

55:52.172 --> 55:54.038
Religious.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.907
A chapel?

55:55.909 --> 55:59.143
Maybe there is a chapel
in the hospital?

55:59.145 --> 56:01.947
Yeah, I...
I still don't understand

56:01.949 --> 56:04.449
why that door opened earlier,
after I electrocuted the nurse.

56:04.451 --> 56:07.485
Because if they're not testing
my intelligence, then I...

56:07.487 --> 56:09.353
What are they testing?

56:09.355 --> 56:11.859
Your ability to kill.

56:13.159 --> 56:15.159
Look at that painting.

56:15.161 --> 56:17.962
It looks like the one
in your living room.

56:17.964 --> 56:19.931
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

56:19.933 --> 56:21.733
It looks like
my mother's favorite...

56:21.735 --> 56:23.304
That's weird.

56:25.406 --> 56:27.271
How come a painting
painted by a patient

56:27.273 --> 56:29.974
in a mental hospital
ended up in your house?

56:29.976 --> 56:32.080
I have no idea.

56:53.967 --> 56:58.503
There is no way out.

56:58.505 --> 57:00.139
What are we doing now?

57:00.141 --> 57:02.541
Okay, well, we're not
going to turn back now.

57:02.543 --> 57:04.242
Let's just go quietly, okay?

57:04.244 --> 57:05.911
Just go through there.

57:05.913 --> 57:08.547
You are screwed...

57:08.549 --> 57:10.384
Lucas...

57:11.951 --> 57:16.355
There's no way...

57:16.357 --> 57:18.023
out.

57:18.025 --> 57:20.092
Just hold this down, okay?

57:20.094 --> 57:22.828
We...

57:22.830 --> 57:24.829
are screwed.

57:24.831 --> 57:27.833
Naomi?

57:27.835 --> 57:30.168
We just want to keep going
through, okay?

57:30.170 --> 57:31.536
That's all.

57:31.538 --> 57:33.471
We not going to make
any sudden movements.

57:33.473 --> 57:35.873
We just want to keep going.

57:35.875 --> 57:37.978
That's it.

57:40.346 --> 57:41.880
Why the bars?

57:41.882 --> 57:44.081
We not going to hurt you,
I promise.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.585
Why are you carrying bars then?

57:46.587 --> 57:50.255
Because we need to know that you
don't want to hurt us either.

57:50.257 --> 57:52.090
Okay?

57:52.092 --> 57:54.559
Why is everyone
scared of me?

57:54.561 --> 57:56.962
It's always been like that,
since I was little.

57:56.964 --> 57:58.831
Naomi...

57:58.833 --> 58:02.302
you know that somebody's been
killed in the game, right?

58:03.536 --> 58:05.103
I know.

58:05.105 --> 58:07.572
I saw the bodies too.

58:07.574 --> 58:09.944
Where were you
when the murders happened?

58:11.578 --> 58:13.814
I don't know.

58:17.016 --> 58:19.016
Okay, Naomi,

58:19.018 --> 58:21.119
I need you to take that
out of your pocket now.

58:21.121 --> 58:22.891
Okay?

58:29.462 --> 58:31.195
Slowly, slowly, slowly,

58:31.197 --> 58:34.099
and just put it
on the floor very slowly.

58:34.101 --> 58:36.304
Very slowly.

58:38.272 --> 58:42.040
Someone put it
in my pocket.

58:42.042 --> 58:43.641
Why would you
do that, Naomi?

58:43.643 --> 58:45.277
Chloe, don't.

58:45.279 --> 58:48.012
I always knew you were a weirdo,
but that?

58:48.014 --> 58:50.014
- Don't, Chloe.
- You've been playing Paranoia

58:50.016 --> 58:51.916
from your hospital room
all this time?

58:51.918 --> 58:53.317
- Naomi, Naomi.
- Stay away from me!

58:53.319 --> 58:54.619
- You too.
- Calm down.

58:54.621 --> 58:56.188
You fucking back off!

58:56.190 --> 58:58.190
You're trying
to make me think

58:58.192 --> 58:59.992
I'm fucking crazy.

58:59.994 --> 59:01.192
I'm not.

59:01.194 --> 59:03.328
You're trying to use my frailty

59:03.330 --> 59:07.132
to make me believe I did it
without even being aware of it.

59:07.134 --> 59:09.067
Calm down.

59:09.069 --> 59:12.036
But it won't work.
I know what I did and didn't do.

59:12.038 --> 59:14.508
- Okay.
- So how did I kill them?

59:15.909 --> 59:17.375
Their sleep?

59:19.313 --> 59:21.380
You motherfuckers.

59:21.382 --> 59:24.549
You use the word "crazy" but you
don't have a clue what it means.

59:24.551 --> 59:31.456
They've been messing with
my head since I was a teenager.

59:31.458 --> 59:35.994
They want me to think
I'm fucking crazy.

59:35.996 --> 59:39.163
But I'm so tired
of all this shit.

59:39.165 --> 59:41.500
- Calm down.
- I'm so tired of you

59:41.502 --> 59:43.534
trying to force your vision
of reality on me.

59:43.536 --> 59:47.271
Just... just leave me alone,
okay?

59:47.273 --> 59:49.041
Just... just leave me alone.

59:49.043 --> 59:50.976
I'm not like all of them, okay?

59:50.978 --> 59:52.543
I'm not like all of them,
I promise.

59:52.545 --> 59:55.346
Now put it down, okay?

59:55.348 --> 59:57.482
You can trust me, okay?

59:57.484 --> 59:58.717
Chloe, drop the bar.

59:58.719 --> 01:00:00.451
Okay? You can trust me.

01:00:00.453 --> 01:00:02.721
Chloe, put the bar down.

01:00:02.723 --> 01:00:04.458
Chloe, drop it, okay?

01:00:07.328 --> 01:00:09.126
What's the point of living

01:00:09.128 --> 01:00:11.496
if you can't trust
what you see?

01:00:47.234 --> 01:00:50.168
- Why did you do that?
- Why I did I do what?

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.003
Well, I had the situation
under control,

01:00:52.005 --> 01:00:53.304
but you made her panic.

01:00:53.306 --> 01:00:55.139
Are you serious?
She was a psychopath.

01:00:55.141 --> 01:00:57.175
You thought she would put
the screwdriver down

01:00:57.177 --> 01:00:58.710
just because
you asked her to?

01:00:58.712 --> 01:01:01.949
- She was going to put it down.
- You're so naive.

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:09.690
Goddamn you.

01:01:23.603 --> 01:01:25.339
Chloe?

01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:28.710
Chloe?

01:01:36.315 --> 01:01:38.418
Chloe?

01:01:52.732 --> 01:01:56.601
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

01:01:56.603 --> 01:01:59.340
"You will now ascend
into heaven."

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:04.708
There.

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:07.378
Three piles of dust
right there.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:11.284
You smart-asses. It's a triangle
It's the trinity.

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:37.511
Three different drills.

01:02:38.478 --> 01:02:40.747
Three extraction forceps.

01:02:41.848 --> 01:02:44.217
Three bottles.

01:02:46.353 --> 01:02:48.188
Three implants here.

01:02:58.331 --> 01:03:01.335
Pages 3 and 33
are dog-eared.

01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:04.404
Always the number 3.

01:03:05.605 --> 01:03:07.404
The sacrifice of one's own...

01:04:13.973 --> 01:04:17.608
Let me go,
you fucking assholes!

01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:48.743
What are you going
to do to me?

01:04:51.578 --> 01:04:53.813
Okay, okay.

01:04:59.619 --> 01:05:01.286
Please...

01:05:17.503 --> 01:05:18.940
No.

01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:21.575
No.

01:05:26.013 --> 01:05:27.614
Okay...

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.989
Fuck.

01:06:20.099 --> 01:06:22.837
Please, no!

01:07:01.942 --> 01:07:03.543
Please.

01:07:34.107 --> 01:07:37.442
No! No!

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:41.006
Chloe?

01:08:43.977 --> 01:08:46.714
Chloe, are you okay?

01:08:47.981 --> 01:08:49.948
Chloe, why are you
covered in blood?

01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:52.216
- Chloe?
- I tried to save him.

01:08:52.218 --> 01:08:54.854
He was still breathing
when I got here.

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:17.710
Jablowski?

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:21.078
Holy shit!

01:09:28.821 --> 01:09:30.587
But I couldn't do anything.

01:09:30.589 --> 01:09:32.524
Chloe, what's happened?

01:09:34.727 --> 01:09:36.728
- The killer...
- Chloe?

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:38.997
...he grabbed me before I could
call you for help.

01:09:38.999 --> 01:09:41.100
Why did you disappear, Chloe?

01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:44.203
But I managed to escape.

01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:56.314
Okay, come on.

01:09:56.316 --> 01:09:58.919
Let's go, okay?
Let's get out of here.

01:10:01.187 --> 01:10:03.591
It's just the two of us now.

01:10:13.732 --> 01:10:15.699
Find a way out of here, Chloe.
Help me.

01:10:15.701 --> 01:10:18.638
Because there's still a killer
on the loose, isn't there?

01:10:19.739 --> 01:10:22.140
The prize will be ours.

01:10:22.142 --> 01:10:24.943
Chloe, isn't there?

01:10:24.945 --> 01:10:26.580
Chloe?

01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:31.584
Tarot cards often hide
biblical symbols.

01:10:36.222 --> 01:10:38.855
Well, this one's
kind of biblical.

01:10:38.857 --> 01:10:40.958
Now this one has a bit
of a biblical references.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.762
There's seven branches here,
evenly spaced.

01:10:45.764 --> 01:10:47.966
You know, like the seven rungs
of Jacob's Ladder?

01:10:47.968 --> 01:10:49.603
Chloe?

01:10:51.737 --> 01:10:54.905
Like the...

01:10:54.907 --> 01:10:57.044
seven degrees of initiation,
you know?

01:10:58.812 --> 01:11:02.683
You know, what connected
man from Earth to heaven...

01:11:03.883 --> 01:11:05.286
or hell?

01:11:08.989 --> 01:11:10.924
Do you see Jacob anywhere?

01:11:15.995 --> 01:11:17.797
That's Jacob.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:01.240
Come on, time to see what's
waiting for us at the top.

01:12:02.842 --> 01:12:04.277
Okay.

01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:22.092
Why have you stopped, Chloe?

01:12:22.094 --> 01:12:23.961
- Sorry.
- What...?

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.870
You fucking cunt!

01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:41.949
Fucking cunt!

01:13:12.277 --> 01:13:14.077
You fucking...

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:16.015
fucking bitch!

01:13:31.798 --> 01:13:33.734
Chloe!

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.879
Chloe!

01:14:00.426 --> 01:14:02.463
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:14:04.196 --> 01:14:05.833
Ah.

01:14:07.499 --> 01:14:09.466
Lucas, I'm cold.

01:14:09.468 --> 01:14:11.471
For Christ sake, what...?

01:14:13.071 --> 01:14:14.842
Okay.

01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:18.846
Ah... what happened?

01:14:21.114 --> 01:14:22.516
Lucas...

01:14:24.484 --> 01:14:27.083
Lucas. Lucas.

01:14:27.085 --> 01:14:28.920
Please forgive me.

01:14:33.192 --> 01:14:34.524
No, no, stay with me.

01:14:34.526 --> 01:14:37.797
This place, it made me
lose my mind.

01:14:41.534 --> 01:14:43.600
Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, stay...
stay with me.

01:14:43.602 --> 01:14:46.237
No, you go.

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:49.810
Now, you're ready to face life.

01:14:52.212 --> 01:14:54.514
I love you, sweetheart.

01:14:58.284 --> 01:14:59.850
No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:59.852 --> 01:15:02.252
Chloe? Chloe?

01:15:02.254 --> 01:15:03.621
Chloe?

01:15:35.454 --> 01:15:38.322
Come on, you fucking coward!

01:15:38.324 --> 01:15:40.060
Where are you?

01:15:48.901 --> 01:15:50.603
Come on!

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:56.306
Come on!

01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:58.212
Come and face me.

01:16:25.338 --> 01:16:28.972
Come on, come and face me,
you fucking coward.

01:16:28.974 --> 01:16:32.279
Come on, what are you
waiting for?

01:17:19.325 --> 01:17:21.257
Go ahead. Take it off.

01:17:21.259 --> 01:17:25.065
See how much of a monster
you really are.

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.404
Look at what
you're capable of.

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:37.541
I've been hiding the truth
from you for years now.

01:17:37.543 --> 01:17:41.315
It's time for you to take
responsibility for your actions.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.148
You created Paranoia

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:46.550
to lure Chloe
into your trap.

01:17:46.552 --> 01:17:48.385
She'd been avoiding you
for years now.

01:17:48.387 --> 01:17:51.657
Since she dumped you, actually.

01:17:53.159 --> 01:17:54.728
Shut up!

01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:58.298
You harassed her so much...

01:17:59.798 --> 01:18:04.301
she left you because you were so
paranoid and violent.

01:18:04.303 --> 01:18:05.536
Chloe!

01:18:05.538 --> 01:18:07.570
Chloe!

01:18:07.572 --> 01:18:09.273
Shut up!

01:18:09.275 --> 01:18:10.573
Shut up.

01:18:10.575 --> 01:18:12.176
It's what you really want,
is it?

01:18:12.178 --> 01:18:13.644
It is what you really want?

01:18:13.646 --> 01:18:16.413
To forget about the monster
and go on as before?

01:18:16.415 --> 01:18:18.718
To forget your conscience...

01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:28.295
Lucas?

01:18:32.731 --> 01:18:35.332
Back off.

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.500
Lucas...

01:18:36.502 --> 01:18:40.171
I said back off. Huh?

01:18:40.173 --> 01:18:42.439
Because you're trying
to drive me crazy, aren't you?

01:18:42.441 --> 01:18:44.140
That's what you're doing.

01:18:44.142 --> 01:18:46.377
Or at least trying to make me
think I'm crazy.

01:18:46.379 --> 01:18:48.679
You're trying to make me
use my frailty

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:50.847
to believe I did something
I wasn't even aware of.

01:18:50.849 --> 01:18:53.219
I know what I did
and didn't do.

01:18:54.352 --> 01:18:56.022
Shut up!

01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:33.357
Mom, I can't do it.

01:19:33.359 --> 01:19:35.391
Keep trying, sweetheart.
Don't give up.

01:19:35.393 --> 01:19:38.295
It's too difficult.

01:19:38.297 --> 01:19:40.663
You will make it.
You're the best.

01:19:40.665 --> 01:19:42.502
You'll always be the best.

01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:46.206
Now, concentrate.

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:53.577
I love you, Mom.

01:19:53.579 --> 01:19:56.483
I love you too, but you'll have
to do much better.

01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:01.585
Mom?

01:20:01.587 --> 01:20:03.220
Come back!

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:23.703
Help!

01:21:24.837 --> 01:21:27.003
Please, help!

01:21:27.005 --> 01:21:29.209
Help!

01:21:29.874 --> 01:21:31.511
Please.

01:21:33.879 --> 01:21:35.815
Help!

01:21:39.852 --> 01:21:41.484
Help!

01:21:45.724 --> 01:21:50.293
Over here! Over here!

01:21:50.295 --> 01:21:53.633
You said you've seen a man
with an orange uniform?

01:21:55.534 --> 01:21:57.504
What happened to your hand?

01:22:01.874 --> 01:22:05.542
It's an injury
from when I was a child.

01:22:05.544 --> 01:22:07.043
Right, just wait a minute.

01:22:25.865 --> 01:22:28.799
All right all right,
calm down.

01:22:28.801 --> 01:22:32.905
You need to get some rest, okay?
We're going to take you home.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.939
But don't leave town.

01:22:35.941 --> 01:22:38.311
I still have got some questions
for you.

01:22:39.078 --> 01:22:40.644
Okay.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.894
I know what I did
and didn't do.

01:24:37.896 --> 01:24:41.899
So, uh, how did I kill
my mother?

01:24:41.901 --> 01:24:43.199
Asleep?

01:24:43.201 --> 01:24:45.003
Back off!

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:43.260
I've been waiting
for this moment to come.

01:25:43.262 --> 01:25:46.032
Now you're ready to face life.

01:26:58.005 --> 01:27:03.005
