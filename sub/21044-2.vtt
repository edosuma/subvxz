Excuse me, I'm sorry.

I have no idea how she got here.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.644
Do you know her?

01:00.811 --> 01:03.647
Yes, I know her. She's...

01:03.772 --> 01:05.482
She's my little sister.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.737
My sister, Claire.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.912
She was adopted.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.624
We were supposed to meet outside,
but she must have wandered in here.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.249
I see.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.794
And who are you?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.545
Me?

01:28.881 --> 01:29.840
I'm...

This is Seth, Chef.

That's right, I'm a waiter here.

Of course, Seth.

-Great job tonight.
-Thank you.

Don't forget this, Seth.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.655
Thank you, Seo-yeon.

Bye.

[Ga-in] What the hell was that?

Joon?

03:00.471 --> 03:02.265
I better call it a night.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.268
You should finish up and head home, too.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.647

03:28.458 --> 03:30.335
[Seth] Claire, you're
going to have to listen to me.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.587
-Yeah. Hi.
-Um...

03:33.088 --> 03:34.840
So I should probably start
from the basics.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.466
It's called Dramaworld.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.468
Capital D, lowercase W, all one word

03:38.551 --> 03:41.847
as opposed to the real world,
all lowercase, two words,

03:41.930 --> 03:44.141
which is where you're from
and where I am from

03:44.224 --> 03:46.559
in this world, no one else.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.479
- Wait, is that where--?
- Claire, Claire! Hi!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.065
-Sorry, I'm sorry.
-Ah...

03:51.148 --> 03:52.733
That'll be ten dollars.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.319
-Wait, how come I understand him?
-Oh, uh...

03:56.820 --> 03:58.446
Everything here is subtitled, so

03:58.529 --> 04:02.450
after a while, you won't even notice it,
it'll be like you're speaking Korean.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.286
Can you understand me?

04:06.830 --> 04:07.956
Yes.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.460
I speak

04:13.294 --> 04:14.755
Korean?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.632
Ah, well, not exactly but...

04:17.715 --> 04:20.343
-This place is freaking amazing!
-Okay, yes.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.805

05:57.732 --> 05:59.151
This...

05:59.234 --> 06:02.237

06:02.321 --> 06:04.655
This, for lack of a better word,

06:05.365 --> 06:07.450
is life. Okay.

Hey!

Seo-yeon! What are you doing here?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.301
I brought you hot chocolate.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.471
This brings back memories, doesn't it?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.558
You look happy today.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.270
Yup, it wasn't such a bad day after all.

-Hey!
-Huh?

06:46.365 --> 06:47.448
Oh.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.744
Come in and tell me all about it, then.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.373
"On occasion, a crisis will arise

06:54.455 --> 06:57.875
that requires a non-character facilitation
to realign a drama."

06:57.960 --> 06:59.502
This is such an occasion, meaning,

06:59.585 --> 07:01.671
there's something wrong in Dramaworld

07:01.754 --> 07:04.674
and they need someone from the outside
to fix it.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.386
Um...

Yeah, um...

07:11.848 --> 07:12.975
Cool!

07:13.474 --> 07:15.643
But why me?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.563
Well, obviously, you're a huge fan,

07:18.646 --> 07:23.151
but, you know, maybe there's something
special about you in particular.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.320
Special?

07:25.404 --> 07:29.324
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm totally unspecial.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.743
I mean, I'm not even
the main character in my own life.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.579
Then you're perfect.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.039
Um...

07:36.622 --> 07:38.041
With this handbook,

07:38.749 --> 07:42.879
you will have all the tools necessary
to bring Dramaworld back to order.

Yeah. Now let, let's skip ahead. Okay.

"A drama ends with true love's kiss."

07:56.726 --> 07:58.353

There can be bumps and detours."

leading towards true love."</i>

08:38.435 --> 08:39.478
"Law number five."

08:39.602 --> 08:42.688
"Upon true love being achieved,
the drama will be reset."

08:42.772 --> 08:46.068
"Character's memories will be wiped clean
in preparation for their next drama

08:46.151 --> 08:49.946
so that they can fall in love
for the first time again

08:50.030 --> 08:53.450
<i>and again, and again."</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.410
That is so cool!

08:57.245 --> 08:59.622
So what if something happens
and they don't?

08:59.705 --> 09:00.831
Oh, uh,

has not kissed the leading lady

09:06.796 --> 09:09.216
and true love is not achieved,

09:09.466 --> 09:11.385
Dramaworld will cease to exist."

09:13.512 --> 09:14.845
Wait, what?

09:15.514 --> 09:16.639
What?

09:18.683 --> 09:20.685
K-drama will just disappear?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.312
Poof, gone! That's it?

09:22.770 --> 09:25.856
I just got here!
How can you be so calm about this?

09:26.023 --> 09:26.983
I'm not!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.361
Uh, believe me, I'm scared to death.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.989
If Dramaworld ends,
all these people cease to exist

09:33.073 --> 09:35.534
and I lose the one thing I truly love.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.743
Life without K-drama?

09:41.038 --> 09:42.124
Dude!

09:42.416 --> 09:45.168
I know, but we can fix the story.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.629
Together, we can get Joon Park
and Seo-yeon to finally fall in love.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.508
We can save Dramaworld.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.054
My dad is going to be super pissed
if I don't show up for work tomorrow.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.473
He, he'll never know you were gone.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.765

09:59.849 --> 10:01.435

only an hour goes by,

10:01.518 --> 10:03.186
the exact length of an episode.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.895
There're only eight episodes left.
