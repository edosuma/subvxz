AMY (VOICEOVER):
Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.754 --> 00:06.089
 I have some news.

00:06.214 --> 00:09.884
These investors want to open
up a Maggie's in Brooklyn.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.262
 I thought you were just going
to New York for like a week.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.805
 Yeah, well, one
week has turned

00:13.930 --> 00:15.682
into two weeks, plus
investor meetings all summer.

00:15.807 --> 00:16.975
And it's only
going to get busier

00:17.100 --> 00:18.393
when we launch in the fall.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.978
 So you know?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.646
 Everyone knows.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.314
I mean, why else
wouldn't Casey be

00:23.440 --> 00:24.649
at our New Year's Eve dinner?

00:24.774 --> 00:27.402
 We took a break.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.821
My idea.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.573
I don't know if it's
the right one or not.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.409
But I'm the one that opened
my mouth and suggested it.

00:34.534 --> 00:40.081
And she didn't disagree,
so we haven't talked since.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.709
[music playing]

00:59.017 --> 01:00.643
GEORGIE: Hey, Woody.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.855
How are you doing?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.022
Hi.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.024
 So how is he?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.525
GEORGIE: Good.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.153
Bob says his gunshot
wound is almost healed up.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.571
 Amazing.

01:11.696 --> 01:14.949
 Yeah, don't you just
love working here?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.910
 Yeah.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.078
But our shift's over.

01:18.203 --> 01:18.995
So we should hit the books.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.288
 Seriously?

01:20.413 --> 01:21.206
Don't you think
we've studied enough

01:21.331 --> 01:22.457
for that stupid math test?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.709
 We need to brush
up a little more.

01:24.834 --> 01:25.752
 OK.

01:25.877 --> 01:26.878
But let's do it at Maggie's.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.463
I'm starving.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.464
 Deal.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.802
 Woody's watching us.

01:37.847 --> 01:41.935
JACK: OK, wrench.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.730
No, the wrench is the one that--

01:45.855 --> 01:46.981
look at you.
- [laughs]

01:47.107 --> 01:48.149
JACK: You had it all the time.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.654
Well, I'll be.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.161
Rich Wanstead.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.287
 How are you doing there, Jack?

02:01.413 --> 02:03.540
Well, I can't complain.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.293
Well, now, you didn't come here
to see how I'm doing, did you?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.086
You're not going
to try and rope me

02:09.211 --> 02:10.714
back into the stock business?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.841
 No, you pretty
much told me that you

02:12.966 --> 02:14.467
were done working with me.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.178
But I was hoping maybe
your granddaughter

02:17.303 --> 02:18.430
would feel different.

02:18.555 --> 02:19.472
 Oh?

02:19.597 --> 02:21.016
 I got myself a
bronc that's kind

02:21.141 --> 02:23.476
of lost his mojo, so to speak.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.645
And I was thinking maybe
the miracle girl might

02:25.770 --> 02:27.355
just be the one to get it back.

02:30.942 --> 02:31.860
 Hey.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.486
 They're looking healthy.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.488
 Yeah, they're doing great.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.783
TY: So someone has baby
on the brain this morning.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.326
AMY: Huh?

02:40.452 --> 02:41.619
 You left all the websites
on the computer open.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.662
 Oh, right.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.832
Uh, Lou sent me
a bunch of links.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.043
 Ah, that makes sense.

02:48.168 --> 02:52.672
 Yep, maternity wear, sleepers,
strollers, baby clothes.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.591
 Well, she's just making up
for not being here in person

02:54.716 --> 02:56.301
to badger you.
- I really wish she wouldn't.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.510
She's driving me crazy.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.305
JACK: Morning, you two.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.807
Hey, do you remember
Rich Wanstead?

03:02.932 --> 03:04.100
AMY: Um, stock contractor.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.060
 Yeah, that's right.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.353
Well, he's out front.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.480
He's got an issue with
one of his broncs,

03:08.605 --> 03:09.898
wants you to have a look at him.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.775
AMY: OK.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.070
 Uh, Amy, you can't work with a
bronc right now, not like this.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.988
 Uh, yes, I can.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.616
Ty, I don't have to ride
a horse to work with one.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.034
And I can do that
even like this.

03:21.159 --> 03:21.951
 [inaudible]

03:22.077 --> 03:22.827
 OK, but--

03:22.952 --> 03:24.037
 No.

03:24.162 --> 03:24.954
 --I'm looking
out for you, Amy.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.790
 Stop, OK?

03:26.915 --> 03:27.874
Bubble wrap.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.250
Bubble wrap.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.421
[music playing]

03:36.800 --> 03:38.760
ADAM: You pulled up
our next worksheet?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.095
 I-- no, I'm--

03:40.220 --> 03:41.262
I'm looking at something online.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.181
This is unbelievable.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.058
Look.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.895
ADAM: Oh my God.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.105
He killed that bear?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.231
 Yeah, and not just any bear.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.399
A gobi bear.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.525
They're super rare.

03:53.650 --> 03:54.943
And they're only in Mongolia.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.445
And there's only like 30
of them left in total.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.738
This guy killed one
for the fun of it

03:58.863 --> 04:01.866
and then posed for a picture.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.326
 That's just so--

04:03.451 --> 04:04.285
 Disgusting.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.287
TIM: What's disgusting?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.288
[door opening]

04:07.414 --> 04:08.707
JADE: You have no idea.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.417
I don't even think he
could ride a horse.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.793
I don't know what
he was thinking.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.003
Guys, over here.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.212
TIM: Wow, I wish I could
see this kind of energy

04:14.337 --> 04:15.630
at my rodeo school, huh?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.479
 So this is Hellion?

04:31.604 --> 04:33.481
RICH: Well, he's a
quiet bucking horse

04:33.606 --> 04:35.025
until you get him in the chute.

04:35.150 --> 04:37.444
Then, he's one of the rankest
broncs on the circuit.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.445
At least, he used to be.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.030
 So what's going on?

04:40.155 --> 04:42.991
 Well, he injured his
back real bad last year.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.451
My vet says it's healed.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.870
But it's kind of like
he's lost his spirit.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.496
 So he's just not
bucking anymore, or--

04:48.621 --> 04:49.998
 Nope.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.876
And it's not much good
having a bronc with no buck.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.919
Looks like I'm going to
have to sell him off.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.087
 He might be gentle.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.340
But he's no broke
saddle horse, either.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.341
Who'd want him?

04:59.466 --> 05:00.925
 Kill buyers.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.594
 I don't want to.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.555
That's why I brought
him to you first.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.516
 He's probably just afraid
of reinjuring himself.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.144
We have to help him get
his confidence back.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.104
RICH: How quickly can you
do that sort of thing?

05:13.229 --> 05:14.522
Give you a couple of days?

05:14.647 --> 05:16.149
 There's no way I
could promise that.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.942
 Oh, sorry.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.737
I've already spent too much
time and money on his recovery.

05:20.862 --> 05:25.533
But if you want to take a
shot, I'll leave him here.

05:25.658 --> 05:29.788
 OK, I'll work with him.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.831
 So then the guy asked
me if I wanted to go

05:31.956 --> 05:33.917
for a ride in his tub sometime.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.878
So I slapped him
across the face hard.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.798
I mean, I thought he was trying
to talk dirty or something.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.884
But turns out he actually
did have a bathtub on wheels

05:43.009 --> 05:45.845
because he was that
crazy rodeo clown.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.013
I felt bad.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.223
But I mean, how was
I supposed to know?

05:48.348 --> 05:49.349
He wasn't wearing any makeup.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
 Hey, I know you.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.398
It's, um, Clay, right?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.357
Saddle broncs.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.858
Kamloops last year?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.026
I beat you.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.027
 Right.

06:01.152 --> 06:01.986
How could I forget?

06:04.280 --> 06:05.073
JADE: What the--

06:05.198 --> 06:06.241
TIM: Hey, hey!

06:06.366 --> 06:07.992
Hey, what's that about?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.369
 He had it coming.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.245
And he knows it.
TIM: Get out of my diner.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.496
Come on.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.417
JADE: Are you OK?

06:16.167 --> 06:17.502
 Yeah, yeah.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.380
 Who was that guy?

06:20.505 --> 06:26.428
[music - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

06:35.228 --> 06:42.902
(SINGING) And at the break of
day, you sank into a dream.

06:43.028 --> 06:43.903
You dreamer.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.450
You dreamer.

06:51.327 --> 06:52.454
You dreamer.

07:01.796 --> 07:03.381
 Wow, what a jerk.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.216
AMY: Such a sore loser all
because you beat him at a rodeo

07:05.342 --> 07:06.301
last year?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.761
TIM: All right.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.305
All right, what did he
mean you had it coming?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.222
 It was nothing.

07:11.348 --> 07:14.059
Just gamesmanship.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.268
 What?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.561
 He drew a bronc
I'd ridden before.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.357
So I gave him some
helpful advice.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.193
I told them that the horse
bucked with his head low.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.069
 Except it didn't.

07:24.194 --> 07:24.986
[laughter]

07:26.154 --> 07:27.155
Right, he gave
him too much rain.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.239
And he threw him.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.699
 Yep, something like that.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.243
 And you guys all
think that's funny.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.661
It's not funny.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.996
That's not gamesmanship either.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.414
And I would have
knocked you on your butt

07:36.539 --> 07:37.540
too if you did that to me.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.209
[laughter]

07:39.334 --> 07:41.503
[interposing voices]

07:50.220 --> 07:51.262
 Seriously?
Again?

07:51.388 --> 07:52.263
JACK: I know.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.807
I'm sorry.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.101
Tim got stuck at the diner.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.894
 Yeah, right.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.270
Is this how it's
going to be now?

07:59.396 --> 08:00.605
Every time he wants
something for the school

08:00.730 --> 08:01.981
he's just going to send you?

08:02.107 --> 08:04.651
 I don't want to get
in the middle of this.

08:04.776 --> 08:08.446
Can we just go over your
upcoming rodeo schedule?

08:08.571 --> 08:09.364
 No.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.615
 Great.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.451
 Jack, it's
nothing against you.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.536
But if he wants
that information,

08:14.661 --> 08:16.162
he can come and get it himself.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.248
We both live and work in
the same small community.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.332
 I get it.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.084
 What's done is done.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.169

acting like grownups.

[music playing]

08:29.676 --> 08:31.970
 That was impressive in there.

You obviously have
all those little boys

08:33.471 --> 08:35.347
wrapped around your finger.

JADE: Whatever.

be with the best.

 (SCOFFING)

08:49.029 --> 08:51.740
 I'll take that as a
no, at least for now.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.996
 Yes, Adam, OK?

08:58.121 --> 09:00.248
That's enough about the test.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.541
Yeah.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.084
All right, I'll
see you tomorrow.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.503
OK, bye.

09:05.628 --> 09:09.758
(SIGHING) How can someone be
so obsessed about a math test?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.135
 I'm pretty sure that's not a
complaint any of my girlfriends

09:12.260 --> 09:13.011
ever had about me.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.055
JACK: You already missed dinner.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.682
 Yeah, I ate
something at Maggie's.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.019
So how'd it go
with the schedule?

09:21.144 --> 09:24.064
 The only thing I
learned was that Casey's

09:24.189 --> 09:26.441
is even more annoyed
than I am about how

09:26.566 --> 09:28.276
you've been ducking her.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.652
 Ducking her?

19:26.207 --> 19:27.167
Child's play.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.501
Wait till you see me on a bronc.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.419
TIM: Yeah, well I look
forward to getting

19:29.544 --> 19:32.714
you into the next level.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.049
 Seriously?

19:34.174 --> 19:35.258
 That's why you're
here, isn't it?

19:35.383 --> 19:36.760
To get better?

19:36.885 --> 19:39.054
 I'm only here because
my aunt wants me to be.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.723
She seems to think you're God's
gift to coaching or something.

19:41.848 --> 19:42.599
 Really?

19:42.724 --> 19:43.975
She said that?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.727
CLAY: She's pushing really
hard for me to join.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.021
But this rodeo school
thing you got going on?

19:48.146 --> 19:49.606
I ain't buying it.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.066
Sure, you can teach someone
how to play the cello.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.776
But riding a bronc?

19:52.901 --> 19:54.486
That ain't something
you can learn.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.279
That's something you
got to be born with.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.448
 First of all, no one's
ever going to teach

19:58.573 --> 20:00.658
you how to play the cello.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.285
And you may think you
were born for this

20:02.410 --> 20:05.080
and that your name is going
to pave your way in the rodeo.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.998
But you better think again
because these broncs,

20:07.123 --> 20:11.753
they don't know the difference
between a McMurtry or a Smith.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.629
 They will.

20:12.754 --> 20:17.425
[music playing]

20:21.262 --> 20:23.515
BOB: Dude, You are not
going to believe this.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.266
TY: What's going on?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.102
 I have a fire burning in my
belly for this gobi bear thing.

20:27.227 --> 20:27.977
 Yeah, man.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.854
Me too.

20:29.979 --> 20:30.897
 Good because I think there's
something we can do about it.

20:31.022 --> 20:31.981
 Really?

20:32.107 --> 20:33.316
Well, what do you have in mind?

20:33.441 --> 20:34.442
 I called this guy
I used to work for.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.069
His name's Gavin.
- OK.

20:36.194 --> 20:37.612
 He works for Veterinarians
Without Borders.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.655
It's this organization--

20:38.780 --> 20:40.198
TY: Yeah, I know who they are.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.616
They take on vets to deal
with animals in jeopardy.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.992
They have volunteers
all over the world.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.994
 Yes, including Mongolia.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.330
And this gobi bear issue has
become a top priority for them,

20:47.455 --> 20:48.456
especially now.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.333
 OK, so where do we fit in?

20:50.458 --> 20:53.461
 He says he can send us there
in a heartbeat, me and you.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.337
So what do you say?

20:54.462 --> 20:55.505
Are we going to do this?

21:03.638 --> 21:06.057
[music playing]

21:07.183 --> 21:08.810
 Woah.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.562
 What?

21:10.687 --> 21:12.564
 Looking a little burnt.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.525
 I know how to cook
ribs, thank you very much.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.277
 I'm just saying, I'd take
them off, if I were you.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.154
 I been barbecuing
for 50 years.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.572
I can handle it.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.073
 Trying to help.
GEORGIE: An obstacle course?

21:22.198 --> 21:23.033
So was it fun?

21:23.158 --> 21:24.576
AMY: Hey, dad?

21:24.701 --> 21:25.952
JADE: I guess it
wasn't totally lame.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.787
[interposing voices]
TIM: Yeah.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.206
 If you're done riling up
grandpa, can I ask you a favor?

21:30.331 --> 21:31.416
 Sure.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.209
 I'm working with this bronc.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.254
And I want him to feel like he's
at an actual rodeo, you know?

21:36.379 --> 21:37.881
See what he's like in
the arena with a bunch

21:38.006 --> 21:39.382
of people watching?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.468
Can I bring him by
your school tomorrow?

21:41.593 --> 21:45.013
 Yeah, I guess I could get
the kids to make some noise.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.806
Maybe they'd show
some life for once.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.016
 [laughs]

21:48.141 --> 21:49.351
 Seems like you're
taking any nasty animal

21:49.476 --> 21:50.769
into school these days.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.854
TIM: I know Clay's a pain.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.190
Best way to keep him
quiet is to beat him.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.441
 OK, who's Clay?

21:56.566 --> 21:57.734
 Casey's nephew.

21:57.859 --> 21:58.902
 He is?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.737
AMY: Wait, you're
coaching Casey's nephew?

22:00.862 --> 22:02.197
 Why else would he
take on that jerk?

22:02.322 --> 22:03.990
 All right, calm down.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.242
I didn't take him on
because he's Casey's nephew.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.244
I took him on because
he shows potential.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.412
TY: Who's got potential?

22:09.537 --> 22:10.622
AMY: Hey, hon.

22:10.747 --> 22:11.581
 No, no.

22:11.706 --> 22:15.293
I'm bored with this.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.378
Here.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.420
There you go, hon.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.339
AMY: So how was the reserve?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.924
 It was-- it was all right.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.634
 What did Bob say
about the gobi bears?

22:22.759 --> 22:25.387
 Yeah, I bet that really
got under his skin.

22:25.512 --> 22:26.554
 Oh, you read the story too?

22:26.680 --> 22:27.597
 Well, yeah.

22:27.722 --> 22:28.598
It's all over the internet.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.392
It's pretty horrifying.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.394
 Yeah, and it's going to keep
happening if someone doesn't

22:32.519 --> 22:33.978
do something to stop it.

22:34.104 --> 22:34.938
 Let me guess.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.606
Bob thinks he's that someone.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.109
He's probably on a flight
to Mongolia right now.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.528
 Yeah, sounds like Bob.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.862
JACK: Look at these babies.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.781
TY: Wow, those smell good.

22:44.906 --> 22:48.118
 Yeah, and they will taste
even better, guaranteed.

22:48.243 --> 22:50.829
 That's because I told
him to take them off.

22:50.954 --> 22:53.331
 I heard that.

22:53.456 --> 22:55.166
OK, dig in, everybody.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.008
 Oh, thanks.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.384
TY: Yeah.

23:04.509 --> 23:08.596
 So what did Bob really
say about the gobi bears?

23:08.722 --> 23:09.889
 What do you mean?

23:10.015 --> 23:12.100
 Well, you were
acting kind of, I

23:12.225 --> 23:14.477
don't know, weird
when Amy was joking

23:14.602 --> 23:15.854
about Bob hopping on a plane.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.275
 Well, he's not
hopping on a plane.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.651
So--

23:21.776 --> 23:23.528
 Well, does he want
to do or something?

23:27.407 --> 23:28.658
What?

23:28.783 --> 23:29.826
What's going on?

23:35.248 --> 23:37.375
 Bob knows somebody
in this organization

23:37.500 --> 23:40.795
that needs vets in Mongolia
to help deal with this.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.880
 Wow.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.214
Are you serious?

23:43.340 --> 23:45.091
 Yeah, and Bob thinks
that we should do it.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.260
 So you could
actually go over there

23:47.385 --> 23:48.803
and help save their lives?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.389
 Yeah, opportunity
of a lifetime, right?

23:51.514 --> 23:52.807
 Yeah.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.144
 The timing with Amy
being pregnant and--

23:56.269 --> 23:58.313
 Well, you have to
tell her about this.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.689
 I will tell her.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.066
Bob needs to get more
information first.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.151
And I want all the facts
before I talk to her.

24:03.276 --> 24:05.653
So please don't--

24:05.779 --> 24:08.031
 I-- I won't say anything.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.075
 Thank you.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.203
 Oh, that's so exciting.

24:13.328 --> 24:14.079
 Keep it down.

24:14.204 --> 24:15.080
GEORGIE: OK, OK.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.769
 Fancy meeting you here.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.855
 Yeah, I'm here all the time.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.649
Just checking out
a couple of horses.

24:42.774 --> 24:44.776
 Checking out a
couple of horses

24:44.901 --> 24:48.196
at exactly the same time that
you know I run my rodeo school?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.239
 So, what are you saying?

24:49.364 --> 24:50.365
You think I'm stalking you?

24:50.490 --> 24:51.616
 Stalking you?

24:51.741 --> 24:54.994
[laughs] I wouldn't
say stalking.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.288
I'd say maybe sniffing
around a little.

24:57.414 --> 24:58.248
 Sniffing around?

24:58.373 --> 25:00.208
Did you really say that?

25:00.333 --> 25:04.212
 I know why you pushed Clay
to enter my rodeo school,

25:04.337 --> 25:06.256
using your nephew
to get close to me.

25:06.381 --> 25:11.094
All I can say to that is,
well played, McMurtry.

25:11.219 --> 25:12.762
Well played.

25:12.887 --> 25:13.930
Why don't you just--

25:14.055 --> 25:14.973
OK.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.027
 Here it is, man.

25:27.152 --> 25:28.319
Everything you need to
know about Veterinarians

25:28.445 --> 25:30.572
Without Borders.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.240
- Very cool.
- Yeah.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.491
Oh, and hey, great news.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.410
My buddy Gavin says he's
totally willing to take

25:35.535 --> 25:36.494
us on, even for a short term.

25:36.619 --> 25:37.412
 Really?

25:37.537 --> 25:38.496
BOB: Yeah.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.456
 Great.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.373
 Yeah, man.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.916
Mongolia.

25:42.042 --> 25:43.418
 How short is a
short term, though?

25:43.543 --> 25:45.045
BOB: Oh, it'll be perfect.

25:45.170 --> 25:46.588
I know a guy who's willing
to look after this place.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.840
And you'll be back before
the baby's even born, swear.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.134
 Yeah, but how short is that?

25:51.259 --> 25:52.010
 Four months?

25:52.135 --> 25:55.013
Perfect setup.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.014
 Four months?

25:56.139 --> 25:56.765
No, man.

25:56.890 --> 25:57.724
It's not perfect.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.517
Four months?

25:59.642 --> 26:00.685
What if the baby comes early?

26:00.810 --> 26:01.603
What if there's complications?

26:01.728 --> 26:02.854
I can't--

26:02.979 --> 26:04.939
 Look, I know how huge this is.

26:05.065 --> 26:06.649
OK, you're having a baby.

26:06.775 --> 26:08.276
It's going to be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

26:08.401 --> 26:11.112
But come on, we have the
perfect background for this.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.365
We can protect those
bears and maybe even find

26:13.490 --> 26:14.991
ways to boost the populations.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.368
Imagine.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.578
We could actually help
these guys beat extinction.

26:18.703 --> 26:20.246
And then there's
a local herders.

26:20.372 --> 26:22.082
Apparently, they've lost
most of their livestock

26:22.207 --> 26:23.333
because of a bad drought.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.168
So it's not just
about saving animals.

26:25.293 --> 26:27.128
You'd be helping
people too, right?

26:30.674 --> 26:31.675
 Man, I really want to do this.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.134
 Yeah.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.344
 But I don't know if
Amy could ever forgive

26:34.469 --> 26:37.055
me for taking off right now.

26:37.180 --> 26:41.726
 Well, that's a question you
got to ask your wife, bro.

26:41.851 --> 26:47.315
[music playing]

26:58.076 --> 27:00.286
 It looks pretty
tame for a bronc.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.080
 I've seen plenty
of gentle horses

27:02.205 --> 27:04.249
who were full of surprises
once they get in the chute.

27:04.374 --> 27:07.419
 Right, from all those years
you spent on the circuit.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.254
 OK, I want you guys
to start making noise

27:09.379 --> 27:11.381
like it's the finals
at the stampede.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.465
Let's go right now.

27:12.590 --> 27:16.428
[cheering]

27:17.554 --> 27:18.805
 I think it's working.

27:18.930 --> 27:23.018
[cheering]

27:39.743 --> 27:40.535
 Woah.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.536
 Oh, man.

27:41.661 --> 27:42.704
I did not see that coming.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.122
 I did.

27:44.247 --> 27:46.041
Never rule out what any
bronc is capable of.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.548
 This was a good idea, Amy.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.760
I figure that horse
officially has his mojo back.

27:56.885 --> 28:02.974
[laughs]

28:03.099 --> 28:04.893
JADE: It's so cool
to see a top flight

28:05.018 --> 28:06.311
horse like that up close.

28:06.436 --> 28:07.771
 I've ridden a couple
that are just as nasty.

28:07.896 --> 28:08.980
 Do you ever shut the hell up?

28:09.105 --> 28:10.315
 I'm just saying I have.

28:10.440 --> 28:11.566
Right through the horn.

28:11.691 --> 28:12.984
I could probably do
the same on that guy.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.361
 You're so full of it.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.487
 Confidence?

28:15.612 --> 28:16.988
I'll take that.

28:17.113 --> 28:18.198
 You know, I think I
could ride that horse too.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.491
But you don't see me
bragging about it.

28:19.616 --> 28:20.992
 You just did.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.452
So let's see who's got
the game to back it up.

28:22.577 --> 28:23.536
Match ride.

28:23.661 --> 28:24.746
Right here, right now.
- No.

28:24.871 --> 28:25.830
Nobody's riding Hellion.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.332
He's done his work for today.

28:27.457 --> 28:28.458
Thanks.

28:28.583 --> 28:29.501
 So bring him back tomorrow.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.919
AMY: You're crazy.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.545
 You want to get the
rodeo ready, don't you?

28:32.671 --> 28:33.672
Wouldn't it be a
good idea to get

28:33.797 --> 28:34.923
him used to some actual riders?

28:35.048 --> 28:36.216
 You know, in case
you haven't noticed,

28:36.341 --> 28:37.842
Hellion is a professional.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.345
And you guys are not.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.388
 Oh, I get it.

28:41.513 --> 28:42.681
You don't want a
girl to get hurt.

28:42.806 --> 28:43.848
 OK, that's BS.

28:43.973 --> 28:44.808
I can ride that horse.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.142
Let me show him.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.143
 You really think
you can ride Hellion?

28:47.268 --> 28:48.478
 Yeah.

28:48.603 --> 28:52.148
 Absolutely.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.609
 Can you bring
him back tomorrow?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.403
 Are you serious?

28:56.528 --> 28:58.363
 Who am I to stand in the way
of these budding rodeo stars?

29:02.033 --> 29:03.743
All right.

29:03.868 --> 29:06.871
But today, we get to do
the obstacle course again.

29:06.996 --> 29:07.914
So grab your gear.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.332
And start setting things up.

29:09.457 --> 29:10.291
You two.

29:10.417 --> 29:11.084
Guys, come on.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.168
Now.
Let's go.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.211
One.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.590
 Come on, dad.

29:17.716 --> 29:19.009
 Who knows?

29:19.134 --> 29:20.552
Maybe it'll knock them
down a peg or two.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.388
Or kill them.

29:23.513 --> 29:24.973
 Just saying.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.517
GEORGIE: You only missed out
on the best mark in the class

29:27.642 --> 29:29.352
by a couple percent.

29:29.477 --> 29:32.188
 It's all because
of that one question.

29:32.313 --> 29:35.734
 Stop beating
yourself up about it.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.820
 I must have plugged the
wrong number in the cosine law.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.656
How could I have been so stupid?

29:41.781 --> 29:43.658
You know, this is the first
time I didn't get the best

29:43.783 --> 29:45.994
mark in class in forever.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.370
 Well, I'm the only
one who beat you.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.498
So that just means
you're a great tutor.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.584
 Maybe I should have used
the same simplistic formula

29:52.709 --> 29:54.461
you used.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.379
I just can't
believe you beat me.

30:01.051 --> 30:01.968
 Tomorrow morning.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.511
Rodeo grounds.
Be there.

30:03.636 --> 30:04.429
 OK.

30:04.554 --> 30:07.098
 Clay is so going down.

30:07.223 --> 30:08.850
You know that bronc that
Amy's been working with?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.602
 Yeah, the one
who's lost his mojo.

30:10.727 --> 30:11.895
 Yeah, well, he's got it back.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.605
And Clay's going to ride him.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.190
GEORGIE: What?

30:15.315 --> 30:16.733
 Yeah, and so am I.
We're doing a match ride.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.902
So whoever can stay on
the longest is the winner.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.653
 Well, are you sure
you can handle him?

30:20.779 --> 30:22.197
 Clay's all talk.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.616
 I meant the horse.

30:24.741 --> 30:25.784
 Better than Clay can.

30:25.909 --> 30:26.951
JADE'S FRIEND:
Yeah, you got this.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.625
 Hop, hop, hop scotch.

30:33.750 --> 30:34.793
I win!

30:34.918 --> 30:37.045
 Boy, you got me there.

30:37.170 --> 30:40.048
How did you do that again?

30:40.173 --> 30:42.300
Is everything OK?

30:42.425 --> 30:43.218
 Yeah.

30:43.343 --> 30:44.511
Yeah.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.972
We got our marks back
on our math tests today.

30:48.098 --> 30:49.766
 Uh oh, not good.

30:49.891 --> 30:50.767
 Oh no.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.977
Actually, I got 95%.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.230
An A plus.

30:55.355 --> 30:56.648
 95%?

30:56.773 --> 30:59.943
 Adam's all upset that
I beat him, though.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.736
 You beat Adam?

31:01.861 --> 31:02.821
 [laughs] I know.

31:02.946 --> 31:03.988
I'm just as shocked as you are.

31:04.114 --> 31:07.784
Just not as blown away as he is.

31:07.909 --> 31:10.161
He's acting like it's the end
of the world or something.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.996
 Oh well, I'm
sorry to hear that.

31:12.122 --> 31:14.290
But don't let it
take away from this.

31:14.416 --> 31:15.750
95%.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.460
You got to be proud about that.

31:17.585 --> 31:20.296
 Thanks, Jack.

31:20.422 --> 31:21.798
 Wait till you tell your mom.

31:21.923 --> 31:24.009
We'll hear her screaming
all the way from New York.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.260
 I'll go Skype her right now.

31:29.097 --> 31:33.518
[music playing]

31:49.826 --> 31:52.704
TY: Amy?

31:52.829 --> 31:54.039
AMY: Tada!

31:54.164 --> 31:55.498
A changing table.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.876
 Oh my gosh.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.252
That's amazing.

31:59.377 --> 32:00.712
 Isn't it so cute?

32:00.837 --> 32:03.423
I just put it together myself.

32:03.548 --> 32:04.591
 I love it.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.968
 It's starting to
feel like this space

32:07.093 --> 32:08.678
is for three, doesn't it?

32:08.803 --> 32:10.138
 Yeah, yeah.

32:10.263 --> 32:11.848
 And we'll get a little
mobile and hang it

32:11.973 --> 32:13.391
right above the cradle.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.393
 OK, let's not get ahead
of ourselves too much there.

32:15.518 --> 32:16.728
We still have five months to go.

32:16.853 --> 32:19.147
 I'm starting to sound
like Lou, aren't I?

32:19.272 --> 32:20.190
 Just a little bit.

32:20.315 --> 32:21.191
 [laughs] Just--

32:21.316 --> 32:21.983
I had the most amazing day.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.276
 Yeah?

32:23.401 --> 32:25.028
 I made great
progress with Hellion.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.072
And it just made me realize that
there's so much I can still do,

32:27.197 --> 32:28.865
even if I can't ride.

32:28.990 --> 32:32.243
And then I went shopping,
and I found this.

32:32.369 --> 32:35.872
Just, I don't know,
it all hit me at once.

32:35.997 --> 32:36.915
How exciting is this?

32:37.040 --> 32:38.249
Planning for our baby together.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.751
[laughs]

32:43.797 --> 32:45.048
What's this?

32:45.173 --> 32:47.258
 Oh, that's nothing.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.386
Just something from work.

32:49.511 --> 32:51.137
You did a great job putting
this thing together.

32:51.262 --> 32:52.055
 Thank you.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.223
 Come here.

33:02.107 --> 33:04.567
[music playing]

33:04.693 --> 33:05.485
 Oh, boy.

33:05.610 --> 33:06.569
Thanks, Jack.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.655
Guys, will you
help Jack, please?

33:08.780 --> 33:10.031
 Are you crazy?

33:10.156 --> 33:11.032
I know that horse.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.575
My nephew's not riding him?

33:12.701 --> 33:14.494
And neither should
Jade, for that matter.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.121
You're the one who's always
been so protective of her.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.914
Now, you're just going to
let her ride a pro bronc?

33:18.039 --> 33:20.083
 I know that neither one of
them is likely to ride him out,

33:20.208 --> 33:21.167
OK?

33:21.292 --> 33:22.585
But they can both take a fall.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.713
So it's probably going
to be a good lesson.

33:24.838 --> 33:26.214
 I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.716
TIM: See, right there?
That?

33:27.841 --> 33:30.760
That trash talking and bragging
between the two of them?

33:30.885 --> 33:31.678
Talk's cheap, bud.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.013
It's time to ride.

33:33.138 --> 33:34.139
 I couldn't agree more.

33:34.264 --> 33:35.181
 Right there.

33:35.306 --> 33:36.516
 If anything happens to him--

33:46.735 --> 33:49.195
 This should be pretty cool.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.488
 You're not worried about Jade?

33:50.613 --> 33:52.240
 Nah, she's put a
lot of work into this.

33:52.365 --> 33:54.784
She should be able
to handle herself.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.579
 Sometimes, it doesn't
matter how much you prepare.

33:57.704 --> 34:01.291
One false move, and you
get spilled on your butt.

34:01.416 --> 34:02.459
 Good luck.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.881
AMY: Thanks for coming to watch.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.757
 I'm glad you think there's
something worth seeing.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.634
 You're going to be surprised
at how far he's come.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.802
I'm sure of it.

34:12.927 --> 34:14.596
 I hope so.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.223
But he needs to be all the way
back if I'm going to keep him.

34:20.351 --> 34:23.021
 OK, don't do anything stupid.

34:23.146 --> 34:24.397
You can handle him.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.065
But if you get in
any kind of trouble,

34:26.190 --> 34:28.318
you got to double grab and let
the pickup man get you, OK?

34:28.443 --> 34:29.819
 I'll be fine.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.321
 Yeah, well, I'm not
really worried about you.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.655
It's Casey I'm worried about.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.282
She'll kill me if
anything happens to you.

34:34.407 --> 34:37.452
So don't be a hero.

34:37.577 --> 34:40.580
OK, you got this.

34:47.629 --> 34:51.382
[neighing]

34:51.507 --> 34:52.342
JADE: Come on, Hellian.

34:52.467 --> 34:53.592
You can do it.

35:14.072 --> 35:14.948
 Gotta admit.

35:15.073 --> 35:15.907
Pretty good run.

35:16.032 --> 35:17.575
 Thanks.

35:17.701 --> 35:18.201
I was hoping it'd be a little
bit more of a challenge,

35:18.326 --> 35:19.411
though.

35:21.246 --> 35:22.580
Who knows?

35:22.706 --> 35:24.582
You might actually have
a shot on this guy.

35:24.708 --> 35:27.377
Oh, and be sure to give
him a whole lot of reign.

35:34.009 --> 35:35.427
 He did great, didn't he?

35:35.552 --> 35:37.971
 That kid or my horse?

35:38.096 --> 35:39.556
 Both, I guess.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.307
 Not in my opinion.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.893
The only reason an amateur rode
him out was because Hellion

35:44.019 --> 35:45.270
was bucking like one too.

35:45.395 --> 35:46.646
 You have to cut
him some slack.

35:46.771 --> 35:49.357
This was his first time
back since the injury.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.693
 I just don't see that
edge he used to have.

35:51.818 --> 35:54.237
That's the best he's got,
it's not good enough for me.

35:54.362 --> 35:55.238
 Hold on.

35:55.363 --> 35:56.865
Jade still has to go.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.283
Just stay and watch.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.285
Maybe he needed a warm-up run.

36:00.410 --> 36:01.870
 Fine.

36:01.995 --> 36:03.663
But I think I've seen
everything I need to see.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.176
TY: How's the caribou doing?

36:16.301 --> 36:18.345
BOB: Oh, it's pretty much there.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.597
We'll be able to release her
before we head off to Mongolia.

36:23.641 --> 36:27.312
 You know, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.481
 Amy wasn't too receptive or--

36:29.606 --> 36:30.607
 No, it's not that.

36:30.732 --> 36:33.401
I-- I didn't actually tell her.

36:33.526 --> 36:34.986
 What?
Come on.

36:35.111 --> 36:36.404
Man up.

36:36.529 --> 36:38.323
 I'm not afraid of
how she'll react, Bob.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.282
She's not like that.

36:39.407 --> 36:41.368
 Then talk to her.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.119
 It's me.

36:43.244 --> 36:46.039
Bob, I don't want to go.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.540
I mean, I do.

36:47.665 --> 36:50.335
I really want to go, OK?

36:50.460 --> 36:53.338
It's just-- I can't right now.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.215
I want to be a dad.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.592
I want to set a good example,
fight for what I believe in.

36:57.717 --> 36:58.551
But now's not a good time.

36:58.677 --> 37:00.261
Not during the pregnancy.

37:00.387 --> 37:04.599
 You do realize you're not the
one carrying the child, right?

37:04.724 --> 37:05.850
 I don't want to
say anything, man.

37:05.975 --> 37:10.230
I-- I'll never be
able to get that back.

37:10.355 --> 37:13.358
 Well, I'm still going to go.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.651
 Well, good.

37:14.776 --> 37:15.485
 Yeah.

37:15.610 --> 37:17.737
 You're going to do great.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.948
Keep me in the loop with
everything that goes on, OK?

37:20.073 --> 37:21.199
 OK.

37:21.324 --> 37:23.076
 All right.

37:23.201 --> 37:24.411
 All right, I'll see you later.

37:34.129 --> 37:35.088
 More reign, like I said.

37:35.213 --> 37:37.924
Go here.

37:38.049 --> 37:38.883
Suit yourself.

37:39.009 --> 37:39.759
See how that works.

37:45.432 --> 37:48.226
STUDENT: You got it, Jade.

37:48.351 --> 37:49.352
 All right?

37:49.477 --> 37:50.520
 I'm good.

37:50.645 --> 37:56.109
[music playing]

38:21.676 --> 38:22.802
GEORGIE: Jade!

38:22.927 --> 38:23.803
 Jade?

38:26.848 --> 38:29.100
Hey.

38:29.225 --> 38:31.061
 Dammit!

38:31.186 --> 38:32.062
Ugh.

38:35.565 --> 38:37.359
 Could have stayed on if
you'd just given him more rain

38:37.484 --> 38:40.320
just like I said.

38:40.445 --> 38:42.030
 Wow.

38:42.155 --> 38:43.948
Jade had a way tougher
ride than Clay.

38:44.074 --> 38:46.910
 Yeah, Hellion was
back on his game.

38:47.035 --> 38:48.328
I mean, there's not
many pros could have

38:48.453 --> 38:49.871
handled him that time around.

38:49.996 --> 38:51.539
 Does that mean
you'll keep him, then?

38:51.664 --> 38:52.874
 Are you kidding?

38:52.999 --> 38:55.418
You just put the
hell back in Hellion.

38:55.543 --> 38:56.586
Thank you.

39:06.054 --> 39:07.639
 I can't believe I lost.

39:07.764 --> 39:08.848
 You did really great.

39:08.973 --> 39:09.891
 No.

39:10.016 --> 39:11.851
Now Clay thinks
he's better than me.

39:11.976 --> 39:14.521
There's no way he would
have stayed on that time.

39:14.646 --> 39:17.023
 Hey, don't worry
about that guy.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.566
Who cares if you win
this stupid contest?

39:18.692 --> 39:20.026
You rode a pro bronc.

39:20.151 --> 39:22.529
And it sure seemed like he
gave you a rougher ride.

39:22.654 --> 39:26.491
You should be happy you
stayed on as long as you did.

39:26.616 --> 39:29.744
 I hate losing.

39:29.869 --> 39:32.080
 Hmm.

39:32.205 --> 39:32.956
 What?

39:33.081 --> 39:34.541
Did I say something wrong?

39:34.666 --> 39:37.544
 No, it's just surprising
advice considering the way

39:37.669 --> 39:40.296
you've been acting
about the test.

39:40.422 --> 39:41.589
 That's different.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.049
 No, it's not.

39:43.174 --> 39:44.509
And the thing that bugs
you most is that I'm

39:44.634 --> 39:46.177
the one who got a better mark.

39:46.302 --> 39:48.054
You should be totally stoked
about how great we both did.

39:48.179 --> 39:51.141
But you can't get past
the fact that I beat you.

39:51.266 --> 39:54.185
 You don't know what it's like,
Georgie, to always have to be

39:54.310 --> 39:55.145
the smartest one in class.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.062
 Says who?

39:56.187 --> 39:57.439
 Me.

39:57.564 --> 40:00.150
That's who I am.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.318
Or at least, that's
who I used to be.

40:02.444 --> 40:07.198
Now, I'm not even the smartest
one in my relationship.

40:07.323 --> 40:08.408
 Look on the bright side.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.035
At least you're
in a relationship.

40:16.207 --> 40:19.711
 I have to admit, that was
even better than getting

40:19.836 --> 40:20.879
the top mark in class.

40:26.343 --> 40:28.178
I guess you're right.

40:28.303 --> 40:30.722
I don't always have to
be the best every time.

40:30.847 --> 40:32.724
Besides, it was only one test.

40:32.849 --> 40:35.727
I mean, I still have the best
average of the year so far.

40:35.852 --> 40:36.936
 Better watch out.

40:37.062 --> 40:39.397
I could still be
on the final exam.

40:39.522 --> 40:40.815
I am on a roll after all.

40:48.490 --> 40:52.744
 You're lucky my nephew
came away in one piece.

40:52.869 --> 40:56.790
 Yeah, with his ego
intact, unfortunately.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.334
He and Jade have
developed quite a rivalry.

40:59.459 --> 41:00.669
 I'm sure you can handle that.

41:03.338 --> 41:04.673
I think the school is
a good place for Clay.

41:04.798 --> 41:05.674
That's why I brought him.

41:05.799 --> 41:08.134
Not to sniff around your life.

41:08.259 --> 41:10.970
 Yeah, about that choice
of words, I really--

41:11.096 --> 41:12.138
 And just so you
know, I don't need

41:12.263 --> 41:14.391
an excuse to come
by and tell you

41:14.516 --> 41:17.143
how I really feel about you.

41:17.268 --> 41:18.978
It's probably time
I did just that.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.021
 OK.

41:23.066 --> 41:28.613
 Look, the truth
is I still love you.

41:28.738 --> 41:29.698
I never stopped.

41:29.823 --> 41:31.700
You were just moving so fast.

41:31.825 --> 41:33.034
I needed to put the brakes on.

41:37.580 --> 41:38.373
 So what are you saying?

41:41.292 --> 41:43.169
 Well, I'm still not
ready to play house.

41:43.294 --> 41:46.715
But if you wanted to
give it another shot--

41:52.053 --> 41:53.138
 After all these months--

41:55.765 --> 41:56.850
 Would you just cut
to the chase, Tim?

41:56.975 --> 41:58.184
Do you want to be
with me or not?

42:14.075 --> 42:16.077
TY: Hey, Georgie.

42:16.202 --> 42:17.245
Is Amy upstairs?

42:17.370 --> 42:18.538
 Yeah, I think
she's up in the loft.

42:18.663 --> 42:20.081
 OK.

42:20.206 --> 42:23.043
 Um, have you talked to
her about Mongolia yet?

42:26.463 --> 42:29.466
 No, I haven't talked to
her because I'm not going.

42:29.591 --> 42:30.884
 Oh.

42:31.009 --> 42:31.760
OK.

42:31.885 --> 42:35.263
I guess that makes sense.

42:35.388 --> 42:36.181
 Can you do me a favor?

42:36.306 --> 42:38.683
 I'm not going to say anything.

42:38.808 --> 42:39.768
 Thanks, Georgie.

42:49.527 --> 42:50.362
Amy?

42:50.487 --> 42:51.279
Is everything OK?

42:51.404 --> 42:53.615
 No, it's not.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.033
I popped the button on my jeans.

42:55.158 --> 42:56.117
And I can't get it done up.

42:59.454 --> 43:00.246
 I thought--

43:00.372 --> 43:01.456
 It's not funny.

43:01.581 --> 43:03.708
 I'm sorry, I--

43:03.833 --> 43:05.210
did you get it?
- Yep, good.

43:05.335 --> 43:05.960
 [laughs]

43:06.086 --> 43:07.128
 What's in there?

43:09.214 --> 43:12.425
 This is something
for the baby.

43:12.550 --> 43:13.426
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:13.551 --> 43:14.636
 What is it?

43:14.761 --> 43:15.804
 I'll show you.

43:19.391 --> 43:20.433
There.

43:20.558 --> 43:23.311
I think it's ready.

43:23.436 --> 43:26.981
 I think it's
absolutely perfect.
