WEBVTT

00:25.900 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:42.375 --> 00:45.962
STAR WARS
YOUNG JEDI ADVENTURES

00:49.966 --> 00:51.509
Whoo-hoo!

00:51.509 --> 00:52.594
Yeah!

00:52.594 --> 00:55.430
Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo! [laughs] Yeah!

00:55.430 --> 00:58.099
Lys, you're amazing at riding a wellagrin.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.268
I've never seen anyone learn so quickly.

01:00.268 --> 01:02.145
Thanks, Gumar. Thanks, Jam.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.397
She's the best with creature stuff.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.569
I'm so glad Master Zia sent us here
to planet Andraven.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.280
I love meeting new creatures and friends.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.704
Whoa. Whoa! Easy. Easy.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.623
Easy!

01:24.751 --> 01:25.752
Ew!

01:26.836 --> 01:28.505
Snowball likes you, Kai.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.882
Thanks... [laughs] ...I think.

01:30.882 --> 01:34.302
Who knew riding wellagrins
would be so hard?

01:34.302 --> 01:36.763
First you must be patient with yourself.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.349
Must be Master Zia.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.936
<i>Varna, thanks for inviting
the younglings today.</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:45.563
-<i>How are they doing?</i>
- They're adjusting well.

01:45.563 --> 01:49.484
They're ready to join Gumar and Jam
for the wellagrin migration.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.111
When the wellagrins need more food,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.905
we move them to the orchard
on the other side of the mountains.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.242
- They'll have plenty to eat there.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.202
We keep them safe on their journey.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.704
We get to help these cute creatures?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.915
I love this mission already.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.918
We'll make sure everyone gets
to the orchard safely.

02:07.585 --> 02:12.340
Now, remember. Stay close by the trail
to avoid any avalanches.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.468
That's when a bunch of snow
falls down the mountainsides.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.263
They can be dangerous,
but stay with us and you'll be fine.

02:18.263 --> 02:22.016
And be sure to get to the other side
of the mountains before dark.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.768
It gets stormy at night.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.187
No problem, Varna.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.022
While the Jedi help with the wellagrins,

02:28.022 --> 02:31.734
you and I will fly Varna to the other side
of the mountains in the <i>Crimson Firehawk</i>.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.696
- Also, I was told there'd be Moogan tea.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.780
Yum-yum!

02:35.780 --> 02:39.993
<i>Younglings, if things get difficult
on the trip, pause and take a deep breath.</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:41.703
<i>The Force will guide and help you.</i>

02:41.703 --> 02:42.996
<i>And have fun!</i>

02:48.042 --> 02:51.212
The wellagrins look like
they're having a blast!

02:51.212 --> 02:53.882
They love to explore and swim
in groups together.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.010
Wow,
I still can't believe they swim in snow.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.014
What's happening over there?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.474
They're heading for that dangerous cliff!

03:03.474 --> 03:04.559
They could fall!

03:05.059 --> 03:06.060
Watch this.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.025
- Wow!

03:12.025 --> 03:14.903
We use the sounds
of our Andraven flutes to signal them.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.571
So they know which way to swim.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.739
Watch me play!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.618
Sounds great, Jam.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.077
You try!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.628
Oof. Mine sounds like a sick bantha.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.421
That's okay, Kai.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.923
These flutes are tough to play.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.966
Keep practicing, and you'll get better.

03:36.966 --> 03:40.220
- Uh-oh. Where's Snowball going?

03:42.639 --> 03:44.849
Oh, no! He's going way off the trail.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.934
I'll signal him.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.488
Avalanche!

03:59.113 --> 04:02.158
That did not go how I expected.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.243
Whoa!

04:08.373 --> 04:11.000
It's not safe here.
We need to get to higher ground!

04:11.000 --> 04:12.210
But the herd!

04:12.210 --> 04:14.754
They can swim through it.
They'll be fine. Come on!

04:20.510 --> 04:22.679
Whoa! That was wild.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.013
Is everyone all right?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.016
We're fine, but the wellagrins are gone.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.436
I thought I could play
the flute like Gumar.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.563
But I was very, very wrong.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.982
It's okay, Lys.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.776
We'll find them all again
before the storm comes.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.281
You're right, Kai. But how?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.365
Hmm.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.622
It's a good idea, Nubs, but there's no way

04:49.622 --> 04:52.083
they could all hear the flute
from this far away.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.296
If we're gonna get them all back
before it gets dark and stormy,

04:56.296 --> 04:59.215
- it'll be faster if we all split up.
- Great idea, Kai.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.134
Now let's find that herd.

05:03.761 --> 05:04.846
There's one!

05:06.055 --> 05:08.641
Oh, no! She's stuck.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.771
It's okay. We're gonna get you out.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.858
She's too scared.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.527
I can't get close enough to untangle her.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.611
Hmm.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.780
Let me try something.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.327
It's okay.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.872
You're safe now.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.255
It's gonna be all right.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.759
Now, just back up.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.765
That's it. Good job.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.725
That was incredible.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.685
You really love creatures, huh?

05:52.685 --> 05:56.022
I do. I love connecting with them.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.774
They have feelings just like us.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.318
- We could learn a lot if we just listen.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.365
<i>Lys, we could really use
your help over here.</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:06.949
We'll be right there, Kai.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.787
We gotta get you back to the others.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.468
That wellagrin is not going to move.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.637
Hmm.

06:28.763 --> 06:29.889
Aha!

06:34.685 --> 06:35.686
Whoa.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.155
- Wow.
- You hungry?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.574
That's it. This way.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.326
How did you know that would work?

06:50.326 --> 06:53.454
Never underestimate
the power of a good snack.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.376
Now, let's find the other wellagrins
and get over these mountains.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.346
- Whoa!

07:22.358 --> 07:25.778
We found all the wellagrins
and made it to the top.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.988
We're halfway there.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.451
Aw, you hungry? Hmm.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.828
Aha!

07:36.330 --> 07:37.790
It's getting dark.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.002
We need to get down to the orchard
before the storm gets worse.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
Wait. Jam?

07:43.754 --> 07:46.007
Where'd he go? Jam?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.093
Jam? Jam?

07:50.928 --> 07:53.931
The power of a snack.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.016
Right, Lys?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.895
Uh-oh. Where'd everybody go?

07:59.395 --> 08:01.397
Gumar? Lys?

08:01.397 --> 08:02.732
Anybody?

08:02.732 --> 08:06.360
- It's okay. They'll find us.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.239
Jam!

08:10.823 --> 08:13.242
I can't see anything in this snow.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.540
First the wellagrins got scared
with that flute,

08:19.540 --> 08:22.585
and now Jam and his wellagrin
are out there all alone and cold.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.128
And...

08:25.963 --> 08:27.381
...I don't know what to do.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.593
Zia?

08:30.593 --> 08:32.428
That's right, Nubs.

08:32.428 --> 08:36.057
Master Zia says to take a breath
when things get tough.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.475
We're here with you, Lys.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.893
Just take a minute.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.938
- Breathe. Focus.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.523
The Force will guide you.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.274
Right. Okay.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.503
That's it!

09:05.503 --> 09:07.505
We can signal Jam with the flute.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.925
If he plays his back,
we can hear where he is and find him.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.736
I hear him. Jam's this way. Come on!

09:30.736 --> 09:32.071
Everyone, link up.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.448
Stay together
so we don't get lost in this storm.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.876
There! By that tree!

09:46.627 --> 09:47.920
Jam!

09:49.505 --> 09:50.631
Jam?

09:51.507 --> 09:52.925
- Yay!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.760
Whoo! Yes!

09:54.760 --> 09:57.054
- Way to go, Lys!

10:00.474 --> 10:02.310
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.520
- Uh-oh.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.689
Another avalanche?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.154
Everybody climb onto a wellagrin.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.365
- Whoa.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.868
Grab my hand.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.203
- Jam!
- Whoa!

10:21.912 --> 10:23.623
- Whoa!
- Hold on, Jam!

10:26.584 --> 10:28.586
Jam!

10:30.630 --> 10:33.174
- Lys.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.886
Yeah!
Yes!

10:37.470 --> 10:38.471
Yay!
- Whoo!

10:38.471 --> 10:39.764
Whoo-hoo!

10:39.764 --> 10:41.724
- Yeah!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.019
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.649
Whoo-hoo!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.150
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.158
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

11:07.792 --> 11:09.752
That was amazing.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.548
Well, we made it.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.592
And so did all the wellagrins.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.761
- Huh. You sure made something.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.389
Too much snow for me.
No, thank you. Goodbye.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.516
Are you kids all right?

11:24.975 --> 11:27.311
Now that was a mission.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.857
I did just like you said, Master Zia.
I paused and took a breath.

11:31.857 --> 11:35.653
Then we found Jam, slid down the mountain
riding the wellagrins, and now we're here.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.989
<i>Well, that sounds like
it was quite a journey.</i>

11:38.989 --> 11:40.491
<i>I'm very proud of you.</i>

11:40.491 --> 11:44.286
So am I.
Thank you for your help, young Jedi.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.498
You're welcome back to our planet anytime.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.252
Oh, yeah?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.337
- Watch this.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.050
Snowball fight!

11:58.050 --> 12:00.553
Whoa! Missed me!

12:09.562 --> 12:12.440
We gotta get that beacon on the droid
before the timer goes off.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.880
Maybe we should wait
until there's an opening?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.631
There's no time to wait, Lys.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.925
We need to make an opening.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.218
- Come on!

12:45.890 --> 12:49.268
Just need to get that beacon.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.317
Oh, time's up, younglings.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.777
Blast!

12:59.987 --> 13:03.574
I really wanted Master Yoda
to see us grab that beacon.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.203
Well, you almost had it,
but you acted a bit too quickly.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.248
Not important it is
how fast you perform a task.

13:11.248 --> 13:15.669
Take your time,
then successful will you be.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.468
Patience.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.561
- Wow.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.282
- Whoa! Whoo-hoo!
- Wow!

13:45.282 --> 13:49.036
Master Zia, Master Yoda,
it's time for you to depart.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.289
Thank you, Dee. Please look after
the Temple while we're gone.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.041
And as for you three...

13:56.252 --> 13:57.253
Phew.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.214
Please clean up the training area
before we get back tonight.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.966
- Yes, Master Zia.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.886
I really wanted them
to see us grab that beacon.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.764
- And maybe they still can!

14:08.764 --> 14:12.643
If we practice while they're gone,
we could try again when they get back.

14:13.686 --> 14:19.692
But Master Zia asked us to clean,
and that could take all day.

14:22.403 --> 14:27.449
True, but if some super fast droids
cleaned up for us,

14:27.449 --> 14:29.493
we'd have all afternoon to practice.

14:33.038 --> 14:36.041
I know Master Zia asked us to clean, Nubs,

14:36.041 --> 14:39.253
but we don't have time
to clean and practice.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.463
But those are training droids, Kai.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.091
How are you gonna get them to clean?

14:44.091 --> 14:47.845
I'll just reset the droids
and teach them to put everything away.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.765
- Okay, maybe if I do this.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.726
Ooh, yeah, yeah. And this.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.519
- Mmm.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.522
I think it worked.

14:58.522 --> 15:02.151
Now, please clean up everything.
This is how you do it.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.281
See? Easy.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.382
- It's working!

15:25.382 --> 15:27.718
See? What'd I tell you?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.136
- Huh?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.096
Whoa.
That was fast.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.647
Wait, where are they going?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.523
Well, they cleaned everything out here,

15:41.523 --> 15:44.068
so maybe they're looking
for more messes in the Temple?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.861
They could break something.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.864
We gotta get them back
to the training area and turn them off!

15:52.409 --> 15:54.203
Oh, goodness. What is all this?

15:54.203 --> 15:56.538
It's okay, Dee.
We'll take care of it.

15:56.538 --> 15:57.957
Yeah.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.800
Hey, I was eating that.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.385
What are they doing?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.553
They must think everything is a mess.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.056
They're stacking things in piles
like you showed them,

16:14.056 --> 16:15.975
but that's not where this stuff belongs.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.310
- We've gotta power them down.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.274
They're splitting up.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.486
Then we need to split up too.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.002
Just five more minutes.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.591
Thanks, Nubs.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.315
Hey, come back here.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.526
- Huh?
- Huh?

17:08.527 --> 17:11.488
- Aw, not again.
Put those down. Please?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.284
Stop moving!

17:15.284 --> 17:17.911
No, no, no, no.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.666
Hey!

17:26.837 --> 17:28.922
No, wait. That's not a mess!

17:28.922 --> 17:30.299
Those are kids!

17:32.551 --> 17:34.386
Something is very wrong with that droid.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.971
All right.

17:35.971 --> 17:40.476
We could do this the easy way
or the hard way.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.271
There they are!

17:46.857 --> 17:48.901
I hope Kai's doing better with his droid.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.570
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.449
My goodness. Oh! Oh, my!

17:56.658 --> 17:58.202
Oh!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.537
- Oh.
- Hey!

18:00.537 --> 18:02.498
Why are they acting so weird?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.708
- I don't know.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.211
I must have done something wrong
when I reset them.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.088
How do we stop 'em?

18:10.005 --> 18:12.341
- Nash fixes droids all the time.
Put me down!

18:12.341 --> 18:13.592
Maybe she can help.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.053
- Nash, you busy?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.679
- Stop that!
<i>Hey, Kai.</i>

18:17.679 --> 18:20.641
I just finished loading up some junk
for Marlaa. What's up?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.854
- We need your help with some droids.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.607
<i>Droid drama? No problem.</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:41.787
Hey, are these the pesky droids
you were talking about?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.960
And are they, uh, coming over here?

18:47.960 --> 18:51.380
I think they wanna clean the <i>Firehawk</i>.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.174
Oh, no.
They don't get to touch my ship.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.052
- Hey, no, thank you very much.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.473
It's not messy.
I've-- I've got a system.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.103
What is happening?

19:06.103 --> 19:08.147
Yeah, they like to stack.

19:17.072 --> 19:19.449
They're all looking at Kublop Springs!

19:20.659 --> 19:23.120
If they get to town,
it'll be even harder to stop them.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.538
After 'em!

19:24.538 --> 19:27.249
It's my fault we're in this mess.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.251
I try to do things too fast.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.836
- Whoops!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.634
Guess they wanna clean this first.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.805
That's it!
I know how to keep them from leaving.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.682
- We make more messes.
- Make more messes!

19:43.682 --> 19:45.309
Make more messes!

19:45.309 --> 19:47.978
What? I didn't know
we were gonna say it at the same time.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.316
- We can get them to follow us.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.401
And I know exactly where to lead 'em.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.710
Whew.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.676
All right, Nubs, block off the entrance!

20:23.388 --> 20:24.848
We've got 'em where we want 'em,

20:24.848 --> 20:27.643
but we still need to catch them
to power them down.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.895
And we haven't done that all day.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.688
Don't worry. I have a plan.

20:31.688 --> 20:33.482
We've been trying to go too fast.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.485
To catch 'em,
we're gonna need a little bit of patience.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.906
Wait for it. Wait for it.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.117
- Now!

20:46.912 --> 20:48.455
Yay!

21:06.306 --> 21:07.975
- Ha!

21:10.978 --> 21:13.230
Whoa!

21:13.230 --> 21:15.232
Whoa!

21:20.696 --> 21:22.739
- Yes! We did it!

21:22.739 --> 21:23.824
All right!

21:23.824 --> 21:26.243
Unexpected this is.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.289
- We better go.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.791
- Yeah. Thanks for your help.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.379
Master Yoda, Master Zia,
you're back already.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.884
Finished our trip early we did, hmm?

21:42.884 --> 21:45.137
Dee called and told us what happened.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.557
We're sorry.

21:48.557 --> 21:53.186
I thought the droids would clean up faster
so we'd have more time to practice.

21:53.186 --> 21:55.439
- But...
- They just made things worse.

21:56.523 --> 22:01.486
Ah. So better to take your time
and do things right,

22:01.486 --> 22:03.113
you have learned, hmm?

22:03.113 --> 22:06.742
We have Master Yoda, so we're gonna
clean this mess up ourselves.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.160
Like Master Zia asked.

22:13.457 --> 22:18.211
And done.
The training area is officially clean.

22:18.211 --> 22:22.174
A wonderfully clean training area this is.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.425
Thank you, Master Yoda.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.761
Since finished cleaning you have,

22:25.761 --> 22:29.389
care to train
with an old teacher?

22:29.389 --> 22:30.974
- Train with you?

22:30.974 --> 22:33.393
Will you show us
how to get the beacon like you did?

22:33.393 --> 22:35.729
Yes.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.482
- Now, do as I do.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.526
- But patient, hmm, you must be.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.492
Patience.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.829
Wait.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.165
Now!

23:09.388 --> 23:12.265
- Did you see that? I can't believe it!
- That was amazing!

23:12.265 --> 23:13.809
We did it!

23:29.157 --> 23:31.576
"Lys and the Snowy Mountain Rescue"
"Attack of the Training Droids"
