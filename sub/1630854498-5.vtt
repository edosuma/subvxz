I can't do everything live!
It's impossible!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.360
If you want real loops, I need a sampler.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.960
I can find a cheap beatbox,
it's not a big deal.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.680

01:27.760 --> 01:30.120
a sampler that can make
more than four-second loops,

01:30.200 --> 01:33.040
that's at least 6,000 francs,
otherwise it's garbage.

he's throwing a huge French rap concert

Guy dangled the show in front of me,
I fucking shut him up.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.520
Yeah, but you accepted a show
and we don't have one song.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.120
We're gonna look like total idiots!

02:47.200 --> 02:48.960
We have no songs, no gear, so what now?

There's already equipment there.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.480

Guys, I just have to say,
I'm simply elated to meet you,

17:25.440 --> 17:28.080
Hasn't really been anything
exciting here for years.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.760
This has energy, there's rhythm.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.960
It's a bit like modern Motown.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.520
Actually, that sample
reminds me of something.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.760
What's that bass line?

17:38.040 --> 17:40.280
It's my secret, not gonna tell you.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.800
Okay, understood.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.720
Farran, I'm sorry, could you please
go fetch some aspirin and water for me?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.200
Yes, of course.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.840
Sylvie has some.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.120
This guy's hurting.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.760
What I would love…

17:53.880 --> 17:55.480
is to introduce you to a lyricist.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.160
Someone a bit more seasoned.

17:58.240 --> 18:02.160
With your style and a bit of experience,
we could do something incredible.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.080
What for?

18:04.240 --> 18:05.880
What do we need a lyricist for?

18:05.960 --> 18:06.800
Thank you.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.760
A lyricist,

18:12.840 --> 18:16.160
uh, it's better to think of him
as a vocal coach.

18:16.240 --> 18:19.320
A lyricist isn't going to sing
in your band, nothing like that.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.680
He'll mostly help you with

18:21.760 --> 18:24.840
with finding your voice, your style.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.520
Because your lyrics are a bit flimsy.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.680
A bit what?

18:29.320 --> 18:31.080
We just signed this other guy.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.880
Do you know MC Solaar?

18:33.720 --> 18:36.040
Well, Solaar, do you know what he does?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.600
Every morning, he gets up,

18:38.680 --> 18:39.920
goes to the newsstand

18:40.000 --> 18:43.480
and he buys all the newspapers
and magazines for that day.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.320
he does research, he learns,
he develops his vocabulary.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.600
And he improvises rap
about current events in the world.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.280
Don't you think that's incredible?

18:53.720 --> 18:54.760
Okay.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.600
Never mind.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.840
And so, for the lyricist, is it a go?

18:59.920 --> 19:01.840
You know what you can do
with your lyricist?

19:02.560 --> 19:04.720
-Alright, we're outta here.
-Yeah, let's go.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.360
Be a dear
and hold that for me. Thanks.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.160
Mind if I grab a smoke?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.840
-Thanks.
-Of course.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.280
What do we do now?

19:16.360 --> 19:18.440
Don't need those guys,
we'll keep doing our thing.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.000
Doing our thing? What's that mean?

19:20.080 --> 19:22.600
You can't record a demo
in a fucking bedroom.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.720
What we need is quiet,
and a bunch of equipment.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.240
Guys, we've gotta find a studio.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.840
What the hell are we supposed to do?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.160
Do you wanna go back in there
and suck him off?

19:30.240 --> 19:33.320
Then maybe they can hook us up
with some old white guy. That'll be great.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.080
Fuck's sake!

19:38.120 --> 19:40.640
Seriously,
this is pissing me off.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.520
[hubbub]

19:49.320 --> 19:52.720
Excuse me. Hi, I'm looking
for the sociology department, building B.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.840
Don't go to this school,
don't know where it is.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.920
So, take the staircase,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.240
it'll be behind the auditorium
on the second floor.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.600
-Okay, thanks.
-No problem.

20:01.880 --> 20:02.960
So, do you rap?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.600
-No.
-Yes. I mean, we're gonna try it out.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.880
Well, it's very important
to speak your mind.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.080
And don't let the boys
take up too much space.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.440
So, you'll see,
it's at the end of the hall to your right.

20:14.520 --> 20:15.920
Okay, thank you.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.680
[dancer] Yeah!

20:30.400 --> 20:31.280
Ease up.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.520
-Hey!
-Hey!

20:37.080 --> 20:39.920
-Hey!
-One, two, three, four.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.560
They're so good!

20:43.640 --> 20:44.480
They're amazing.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.480
See the girl with the red jacket?

20:47.560 --> 20:48.640
Yeah.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.160
That's Dallande.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.640
We can rehearse here on Mondays,
just always after her.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.960
-Shit, that's amazing.
-Right?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.280
Did you write something?

20:58.960 --> 20:59.840
Yeah.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.840
Come on.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.840
-Like right now?
-Yeah.

21:02.920 --> 21:03.880
-Right here?
-Yeah.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.600
Go ahead.

Hey, apparently,
the VHS tape has been selling really well.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.200
So, he wants to do another one.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.400
There was even this guy who come in
and bought the whole batch.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.120

22:59.200 --> 23:01.440
So now,
he wants to do another movie with me.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.480
Isn't that awesome?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.800
He wants to call it "Asian Temptation".
I know, the title sucks.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.600
But who cares?
They're gonna pay really well,

23:06.680 --> 23:08.080

to start making music again,

You sound completely nuts.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.360
Do you think I'm a pimp or something?
I want you to stop this.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.320
Pimp? Do you hear yourself?

23:29.400 --> 23:31.920
Do you actually hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.560
Do you even know what a pimp is?
No, I don't think you do.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.480
However, if you keep telling me
what to do with my life,

23:36.560 --> 23:38.520
then sure, you'll be a pimp.
A lowdown, dirty pimp!

23:38.600 --> 23:41.880
Come on, Béatrice, it's not that.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.040
I just love you. Please, I love you.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.960
But I just don't want you to do this.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.760
-Have some self-respect.
-Self-respect?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.240
Hang on…

23:49.320 --> 23:50.720
Let me see if I understand.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.880
If I sell my pussy in a movie,
I don't respect myself,

23:52.960 --> 23:55.160
but if I get a job at a nasty factory,
breaking my back,

23:55.240 --> 23:57.800
my lungs, my head,
that's what you think self-respect is?

23:57.880 --> 24:00.680
Is that where the difference is
somewhere in your stupid male brain?

24:00.760 --> 24:03.840
I gotta work a shit job
before I can respect myself, is that it?

24:04.480 --> 24:05.800
What about you, you freeloader,

24:05.880 --> 24:07.920
you haven't paid your half
of the rent in months!

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Do you respect yourself?

24:10.080 --> 24:12.120
Can't stand that you do this.
Can't anymore and feel it's because of me

24:12.200 --> 24:14.160
and feel it's because of me,
that it's all my fault.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.600
Well, then I guess…

24:15.680 --> 24:17.760
If you can't take it anymore…

24:17.840 --> 24:19.840
it's because you thought you bought my ass
before anyone else could.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.160
You thought you owned me.

24:21.240 --> 24:24.360
You see? And that, that's a big problem.

24:25.880 --> 24:28.000
But there's something you should know…

24:28.760 --> 24:30.680
Ever since I got raped,

24:32.320 --> 24:33.720
I've been a whore.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.320
That's right, I'm a whore.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.440
Since the age of 11, I've been a whore…

24:39.240 --> 24:41.200
and I'll be one for the rest of my life.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.160
And you'll be a loser
for the rest of yours.

25:20.680 --> 25:22.080
-Hey, how's it going?
-Yeah, just fine,

25:22.160 --> 25:25.840
but there's this Portuguese guy, Lopes,
he wants to buy four thousand's worth.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.520
I told him to go to hell,
but he won't leave me alone.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.480
-I'm gonna kick his ass, just so you know.
-Hang on. Bring him to me.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.600
You got it.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.520
Hey, Kool Shen. So, what's up?

25:52.600 --> 25:53.480
It's all good.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.800
Heard your show the other night,
was off the charts.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.400
Kids can't stop talking about it.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.720
-You know Karim, my little brother?
-We graff together.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.160
93 NTM.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.680
-How's Didier doing?
-Yeah, we haven't seen him around.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.600
Yeah.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.440
-Well, he hangs out in Paris, mostly.
-Mmm.

26:16.080 --> 26:17.040
And so?

26:17.840 --> 26:19.400
They tell me you wanna sell my shit?

26:19.480 --> 26:22.320
It'll be the first and only time.
Just need to make some extra cash.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.440
-To buy a sample.
-That doesn't interest me.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.320
Those guys, they can't do anything else.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.320
And you wanna steal their job?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.760
You know how to speak.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.440
So speak.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.800
Speak for us.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.640
Say what you gotta say.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.520
That's your job.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.880
So, what's NTM?

26:41.960 --> 26:43.400
What's it about? What does it mean?

26:55.920 --> 26:57.080
That's good.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.520
Fuck these guys and their moms!

27:01.720 --> 27:03.040
So, anyway…

27:03.120 --> 27:05.080
When're you guys gonna do something here?

27:05.160 --> 27:07.000
A concert or something, I don't know.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.040
I wanna see that.
Karim, you wanna see that?

27:09.120 --> 27:10.320
-I wanna see that.
-Wanna see that?

27:10.400 --> 27:14.080
I know. We're trying.
But for now, we don't really have much.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.200
How about the radio?

27:15.280 --> 27:17.560
Deenastyle and all that?
I listen to it. Go represent.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.600
Yeah, well, Deenastyle's packed.
Everyone wants in.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.280
We're not guys who wait in line.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.800
Seine-Saint-Denis style.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.560
And if someone fucks with you
or anything at all…

27:33.880 --> 27:35.200
you'll let me know.

27:37.560 --> 27:38.560
Okay, Kool Shen?

27:50.400 --> 27:53.000
[Didier] Get out of the way. Move.
Make way for the stars.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.880
That's it, out of the way.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.200
Hey, Daniel, we're here!

28:00.360 --> 28:03.320
-Alright, everyone out. Let's go!
-What're you talking about?

28:03.400 --> 28:06.120
Hey, everyone.
Welcome to all of you just tuning in now.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.440
Coming to you with Deenastyle,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.840
it's time for some freestyle.
Suprême NTM-Assassin.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.320
Give the artists some room, please.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.000
Hey, what's the matter with that?
The man said to get out.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.160
Dee Nasty, cut the music.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.960
S-O-L-O, Rockin' Squat.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.200
Joey Starr, Kool Shen,
Assassin in the house!

28:22.280 --> 28:25.120
…I wanna dedicate this
to my man Yazid! Lady V…

28:25.200 --> 28:28.000
Big love to Chérif,
and his little bro, Karim!

28:28.080 --> 28:29.880
And we've got our detonator, S!

28:30.560 --> 28:33.720
Okay, we're Nique Ta Mère and Assassin,
so turn the music on!

Suprême NTM-Assassin live in studio!
That was freestyle!

31:00.400 --> 31:04.120
I'm sure you can tell, here in the studio
the temperature is skyrocketing!

31:06.800 --> 31:09.520
[Daniel] Real hip-hop is here.
Genuine French rap.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.680
Gonna keep things going
with an hour of mixing.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.800
We're all in this together. Here we go.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.920
Yep, one, two, one and two.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.240
One, two. Ah! Yeah! Yeah!

31:20.640 --> 31:22.760
-Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah!
-Yeah! It's cool, right?

31:22.840 --> 31:25.600
-What do you think of this?
-Vivi found it. Killing it!

31:26.440 --> 31:28.840
-I don't love it, though.
-With the shoulders?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.960
-No, I'm not into it.
-Got any other ideas?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.400
Of course, I do. Check it out.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.920
Yeah, that's a bit girly,
though. It's girly.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
-That says we've got this.
-Yeah, we've got this. I love it.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.560
-Okay, what is it?
-One, two, make-up on.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.320
-One, two, make-up on.
-Yeah!

31:43.920 --> 31:45.560
Make-up on.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.040
Girls? It's time to wrap things up.

31:48.120 --> 31:49.640
-Already?
-A class starting in five.

31:49.720 --> 31:51.600
Okay, thanks.

31:51.680 --> 31:52.960
Oh, that's too bad.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.800
-We didn't make much progress.
-We'll come back tomorrow.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.480
-Tomorrow?
-Well, yeah.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.920
Vivi, tomorrow we have school.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.640
We'll skip class
and focus on the choreography.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.320
Think we've all got a mom like Patou?

32:06.040 --> 32:09.160
If I skip class, my mom will murder me.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.720
Come on, you ready?

32:13.800 --> 32:14.960
Vivi, come on.

32:23.680 --> 32:24.800
Vivi!

32:28.200 --> 32:29.320
Vi, come on!

32:54.000 --> 32:56.160
My sweet Daniel,
have you come looking for Béatrice?

32:56.880 --> 32:58.240
We haven't seen her.

32:59.880 --> 33:01.120
Did you check at the store?

33:01.200 --> 33:02.520
Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.040
Have a number where I can reach her?

33:05.120 --> 33:07.320
Shouldn't get so attached.
She's always been like this.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.320
Like what?

33:08.400 --> 33:11.600
The quiet life doesn't work for her.
She hates routine.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.960
She always runs eventually. That's all.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.240
I'll make some phone calls,
see if I can find her.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.480
Thanks.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
You good?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.040
I'm okay.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.000
Here, we got this.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.400
IZB actually got us tickets to the show.
To see Big Daddy Kane.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.400
There's only one.

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
Did you lose the other?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.520
No, Dee, I didn't lose the other one.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.480
But there are two of us. What?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.880
There's no point in looking,
there was only one ticket.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.800
Fuck!

33:53.840 --> 33:56.800
I can't believe it, man,
this is ridiculous! I'm fed up! I'm done!

33:56.880 --> 33:58.480
They don't take us seriously.
They're taking advantage!

33:58.560 --> 34:00.560
-Think this is normal behavior?
-Not a big deal.

34:00.640 --> 34:01.880
It's the principle of the thing!

34:01.960 --> 34:04.920
These guys get free publicity
and we can't even get two tickets!

34:05.000 --> 34:06.040
You think that's normal?

34:06.120 --> 34:07.480
No, I don't think it's normal.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.280
We deserve some respect!

34:11.120 --> 34:14.000
You know what, the show is starting.
We'll roast them on the air.

34:23.280 --> 34:25.880
Hey, everyone, this is DJ Dee Nasty
coming to you live.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.360
I'm here with my bro Lionel D,
How're you doing?

34:28.440 --> 34:31.800
-Not too great. How about you?
-No. Shall we drop some truth?

34:31.880 --> 34:34.600
It's time to call out the selfish jerks
who refuse to behave like gentlemen.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.840
Basically,
we wanted to give you a nice gift.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.280
We were gonna give away an extra ticket
to see Big Daddy Kane's upcoming show,

34:40.360 --> 34:42.520
but the organizers
just weren't up to the task.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.640
The little pricks from IZB
had decided not to be very generous

34:45.720 --> 34:48.440
with the people
who are helping French rap progress.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.960
Remember guys,
hip-hop isn't about being selfish,

34:51.040 --> 34:53.960
-it's about helping each other out.
-Yeah, it needed to be said.

Oh, come to mama, baby.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.040
I'll be the dog.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.000
Wait, wait, wait.
Is that guy your manager?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.080
That big blonde guy with the weird hair?

36:49.160 --> 36:50.840
Okay, you guys, she's the dog.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.080
Why is this chick barking like a dog?
What've you guys been smoking?

36:53.160 --> 36:54.480
-Know who that is?
-No.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.320
It's Nina Hagen. She's a star.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.080
What? She's a star?

36:58.160 --> 37:00.240
She's been pretending
to be a dog for ten minutes.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.160
Definitely have some adventures
with Highlander and his woman.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.640
He'll manage you well.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.440
-Do you wanna go get this?
-Oh, fuck you!

37:09.200 --> 37:11.320
-Yeah, I know.
-[laughs] No. man.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.840
You think I'm laughing with you?

37:14.840 --> 37:17.600
Yazid, I have a gift for you.

37:17.680 --> 37:19.840
Thank you.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.040
-Look at that idiot.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.160
And NTM, what does it mean?

37:32.760 --> 37:35.120
It's <i>"Nique ta mère".</i>

37:35.200 --> 37:39.680
It means "screw your mom".
But here, it's more like "fuck off".

37:39.760 --> 37:43.320
I love it. <i>Nique ta mère!</i>

37:43.400 --> 37:45.600
I wish you were our mom.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.960
-Nice one.
-That's true love. Powerful.

So, are you with a record label?

37:56.120 --> 37:59.840
Nope. We wanna stay ourselves.
We don't wanna get fucked by the system.

37:59.920 --> 38:00.960
Come with us to New York.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.520
-What're you gonna do in NY?
-Everything's happening there.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.120
Nothing's happening here in France.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.640
But didn't you guys
just record your first single?

38:07.720 --> 38:09.280
Yeah, yeah. I mean…

38:09.360 --> 38:10.400
it's just a mix tape.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.040
But Assassin's on it.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.680
That's great! And what is the song?

38:13.760 --> 38:14.800
"Je Rap".

38:14.880 --> 38:16.520
-"Je Rap"?
-"Je Rap".

38:16.600 --> 38:18.760
-I'll let you hear it later, babe.
-Okay.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.880
Hey, you don't have to wait.
We'll do it for you now.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.440
Yes, oh yes, do it! I've gotta hear it.

I didn't know about this.
I'm very surprised.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.480
I didn't know she missed that much school.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.320
Uh…

39:34.400 --> 39:37.200
I know
she's not the most academically oriented.

39:37.280 --> 39:38.480
So, I try to guide her

39:38.560 --> 39:41.240
and I try to understand
what she really likes.

39:41.320 --> 39:44.160
Yes, well, in life,
we don't always get to do what we like.

Huh? I hope you're also teaching
that lesson to your child, Madam Sullé.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.240
Because, unfortunately,

39:50.320 --> 39:53.600
I have no time to deal with students
who aren't serious.

39:53.680 --> 39:57.200
So, if she doesn't shape up, immediately,

39:57.280 --> 39:59.800
I'll have no choice
but to expel her from school.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.760
And given her file
and the fact that she's almost 16,

40:02.840 --> 40:05.520
I'm pretty sure you won't find
another school that'll take her.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.360
Not in the middle of the year.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.280
High school isn't gonna get me
where I wanna go.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.240
Oh, no?

40:11.320 --> 40:13.360
And what would you like to do instead?

40:14.240 --> 40:15.520
I wanna do hip-hop.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.800
Do hip-hop?

40:20.840 --> 40:22.280
Listen, Madam Sullé,

40:22.360 --> 40:24.360
I'm well aware
you're raising her by yourself

40:24.440 --> 40:26.320
And that it can't always be easy.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.360
But somewhere in your community
there must be someone who can help you?

40:32.160 --> 40:34.080
Someone with authority, guiding her.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.040
Authority?

40:35.720 --> 40:37.840
Like someone stronger?
Is that what you mean?

40:37.920 --> 40:39.440
Exactly!

40:40.760 --> 40:42.360
A man, you mean?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.760
Well…

40:44.400 --> 40:45.920
A man with a firm hand?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.800
It's funny, but you seem
to have failed miserably in that regard.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.360
That's not what this is about,
Madame Sullé.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.560
I told you that guys was a giant asshole.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.360
-You hear how he talked to us?
-Be quiet!

41:06.960 --> 41:08.400
Stop being a smart-ass.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.120
You wanna do hip-hop?

41:10.200 --> 41:12.440
Weren't you listening?

41:12.520 --> 41:15.280
They don't give a shit
about you anymore. Huh?

41:15.360 --> 41:17.160
Okay. So what?

41:17.240 --> 41:19.240
-I don't care.
-Oh, you don't care?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.160
No. And besides, you didn't even graduate.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.480
No, you're right, I didn't.

41:22.560 --> 41:24.560
But I didn't have your luck.

41:24.640 --> 41:26.520
All this, I had none of it.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.680
Yeah, I'm in the music industry,
but in an office.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.880
Is that what you want?

41:30.960 --> 41:33.320
I'm just an assistant, I've got no power.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.920
And I'm the only black person there.
You get it?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.360
Think you know everything?

41:38.960 --> 41:40.200
You don't know a thing.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.840
So, go on.
You've got your freedom, it's your life.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.000
Decide what you wanna be.

41:46.760 --> 41:47.600
You'll have fun.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.400
You'll see.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.200
You'll finally understand real life

41:51.280 --> 41:53.560
and how hard you've got to fight
for a little piece.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.000
Good luck.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.800
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to Deenastyle,

42:02.880 --> 42:04.960
this is DJ Dee Nasty coming at ya.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.360
We've got
our usual Sunday night hour long mix

42:07.440 --> 42:09.760
and then our guests will be here.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.920
I'd like to start
with something more personal.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.920
Something I wrote. Here we go.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.560
This song
is dedicated to the woman I love.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.960

-That's enough! Motherfucker--
-What's happening?

43:46.960 --> 43:49.640
-You shut your mouth!
<i>-Nique ta mère!</i>

43:49.720 --> 43:51.160
Hey, tell your guys
to stop touching my shit!

43:51.240 --> 43:53.840
-Hey!
-Relax, relax.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.240
-Are you playing?
-Just chill.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.520
You spit on us publicly
on national radio?

43:58.600 --> 44:00.200
Huh? You think we're pricks?

44:00.280 --> 44:03.040
No, man, it was just a joke.
You gotta calm down.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.240
Calm down? I got a job for you, man,
you'll see. Turn on the mic.

44:06.320 --> 44:09.200
Don't touch that record, it's fragile!

44:09.280 --> 44:10.560
Wanna see my 9mm?

44:10.640 --> 44:13.440
That'll shut you up!
That's right, be quiet!

44:13.520 --> 44:14.760
I said turn on the mic.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.160
-No, I can't.
-Turn it on now!

44:16.240 --> 44:18.280
We want an apology! Right now!

44:18.360 --> 44:19.960
Just unplugged everything,
can't turn it back on.

44:20.040 --> 44:21.120
Turn it on and apologize!

44:21.200 --> 44:23.040
What do you mean "turn it on",
what do you want me to do?

44:23.120 --> 44:24.600
It's radio, isn't some kind of toy.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.880
Man, you really are
just a piece of shit, aren't you?

44:26.960 --> 44:28.360
You're a real piece of shit, man!

44:28.440 --> 44:30.440
You humiliate us, you shit on us,

44:30.520 --> 44:32.040
you profit off our culture,

44:32.120 --> 44:34.400
off our backs
while we're out there struggling?

44:35.240 --> 44:37.200
This some kind of joke?
We've never been paid!

44:37.280 --> 44:38.880
You think we're out here getting paid?

44:38.960 --> 44:41.360
And you, Lionel, you traitor!
You fucking clown!

44:41.440 --> 44:43.440
"Nanani nanana. Nanani nanana."

44:43.520 --> 44:46.040
-No one told you you can't rap? Huh?
-Whoa! What's going on?

44:46.120 --> 44:48.120
What is all this?
Daniel, what's happening here?

44:48.200 --> 44:50.400
-Everyone's out of their minds!
-We've heard enough from you!

44:50.480 --> 44:53.360
You had the monopoly, everyone heard you.
Now it's our turn to have a say in it.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.320
You shit on us in public,
now you apologize!

44:55.400 --> 44:58.000
And you're gonna do it on the air!
Right away, asshole!

44:58.080 --> 45:00.280
You! We want the mic, we wanna speak!

45:00.360 --> 45:01.440
I'm never apologizing!

45:01.520 --> 45:04.280
Hey!

45:04.360 --> 45:06.920
Stop! Stop it!
Let them speak! Let them!

45:07.000 --> 45:08.120
-Wanna be on the air?
-Yes.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.440
Stop pressuring everyone,
then we'll put you on.

45:10.520 --> 45:12.280
-Alright?
-There're four mics in there,

45:12.360 --> 45:14.040
so if you want,
three of you go in with Lionel.

45:14.120 --> 45:15.280
You don't get to decide!

45:15.360 --> 45:16.400
-Alright.
-Okay.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.640
Make yourself useful.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.560
-That's enough.
-Bunch of assholes.

45:19.640 --> 45:22.160
No, no, no name-calling.
That's it, okay. It's over.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.520
Too much talking, asshole.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.680
Alright! Come on.
That's enough for now.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.560
Daniel? This can't happen anymore. Got it?

45:31.640 --> 45:32.920
I'm so sorry, Jean-François--

45:33.000 --> 45:34.800
No, we're done here, understand?
Just stop.

45:34.880 --> 45:37.000
It's finished. That's the end.
For everyone.

46:00.920 --> 46:02.920
What up, What up, What up?

46:03.000 --> 46:06.560
This is IZB
coming at you live, my friends.

46:06.640 --> 46:09.000
Dee Nasty is indisposed right now.

46:09.080 --> 46:12.080
And Lionel D is shitting his diaper.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.120
So, we thought you could use
some new voices.

46:15.200 --> 46:19.240
Whatever happens from here on in,
we're gonna make things right.

46:19.320 --> 46:21.560
It's time for a new era of hip-hop!

46:22.640 --> 46:24.320
And we're gonna be the kings.
