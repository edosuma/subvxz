00:02.560 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:18.960 --> 00:22.560
<i>Michael Bluth was infatuated with
his brother's girlfriend, Marta...</i>

00:22.680 --> 00:25.000
<i>a Spanish-language
soap opera star.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:29.440
<i>But when he found out she was interested
in a man named Hermano, he confronted her.</i>

00:29.560 --> 00:32.320
<i>Unfortunately, he discovered too late...</i>

00:32.439 --> 00:35.120
<i>that "hermano"
in Spanish meant "brother,"</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:39.880
<i>and the person Marta was infatuated with
was, in fact, himself.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:42.605
<i>This was distracting
Michael the next day when</i>

00:42.640 --> 00:45.240
<i>he went to meet his
father's attorney at prison.</i>

00:45.320 --> 00:47.640
Look, there is nothing to it.
It's an arraignment.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.245
They announce the charges.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.160
However, it would help
if you all showed up...

00:52.280 --> 00:54.520
looking like a loving,
supportive family.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.640
- For how long?
- Ten minutes, tops.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.520
See if you can
get it down to five.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.920
<i>You know, maybe I should confess
these crimes, save everybody the trouble.</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:07.360
Oh, get off the mount. You're coming home,
guilty or somehow found not guilty.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.880
Hello?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.840
<i>What the hell is going on? I'm waiting to
hear about Marta and this Hermano guy.</i>

01:13.960 --> 01:16.320
Yeah, I checked it out.
I do not think that she's cheating.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.960
- I'm going over to Marta's.
- No, no, no. Don't do that, okay?

01:20.040 --> 01:22.080
just lay low, be cool
and I'll talk to her again.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.040
<i>- That way you won't look
so desperate, you know?</i>

01:24.075 --> 01:25.160
- You're a good guy, mon frère.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.160
That means "brother" in French.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.480
I don't know why I know that.
I took four years of Spanish.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.680
<i>So Michael went to speak with Marta...</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:35.640
<i>about the misunderstanding
from the night before.</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:38.440
- I owe you an apology.
- No, I owe you an apology.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.040
I'm so ashamed that
I was so disrespectful to your brother.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.440
Oh, who cares?
Nobody respects him.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.000
You see, Marta, I have been interested
in you since the first day that we met.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.360
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.680
It doesn't matter.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.160
We live by a code, you and I...
to honor family.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.200
Yes. That's one of the things
that attracted me to you...

02:00.235 --> 02:01.760
your sense of right and wrong.

02:01.840 --> 02:04.000
I also like your hair
and your face and your breasts.

02:04.120 --> 02:06.480
- You're so unlike your brother.
- Oh, thank you.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.560
- Gob is like the cock
of the walk. But not you.

02:09.595 --> 02:10.720
- You are so kind.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.240
- You're sensitive, like a woman.
- That's enough.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.480
We do have to do
the right thing.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.720
- And being together is the wrong thing.
- Very, very...

02:20.800 --> 02:22.640
wrong.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.040
- Is that Gob?
- He likes to make love to this.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.360
- I'm gonna turn this off.
- Please.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.480
Oh!

02:52.560 --> 02:56.280
- Gob's wand.
- Oh, this... this is so wrong.

02:56.360 --> 02:56.759
- Yes.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.000
- No, no, no. Not-Not-Not...
Not... Not hot wrong.

03:00.120 --> 03:03.240
- You know, regular
wrong. I gotta tell Gob.

03:03.275 --> 03:05.040
- No, I have to tell him.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.685
Yes, but you speak a little slowly,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.000
and I really want to get
this thing moving along.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.365
So, listen, you do the noble thing,

03:10.400 --> 03:12.160
and you tell him that
you've met somebody else.

03:12.280 --> 03:15.200
I'm gonna do the noble thing
and tell him that it's me.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.520
While I'm doing my noble thing you
could put those photos in a box,

03:17.555 --> 03:18.355
get rid of the wand...

03:18.360 --> 03:21.160
and we can do the wrong thing
the right way.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.120
<i>And Maeby was getting tired
ofher parents'constant fighting.</i>

03:24.200 --> 03:27.360
<i>I'm saying every time something
starts to go well for you, you blow it.</i>

03:27.480 --> 03:29.800
<i>Nothing has ever gone well for me,
and you know that!</i>

03:29.920 --> 03:33.360
That's my point,
you handsome cowboy, you.

03:33.440 --> 03:39.040
<i>Oh, great. And now you're mocking me,
you selfish, country-music-loving lady.</i>

03:39.160 --> 03:40.960
Hello, Maeby.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.160
Nice cover. Why don't you two just get
a divorce and save us all a lot of grief?

03:44.280 --> 03:48.560
<i>The night before, Tobias and Lindsay
had chosen to sleep in separate rooms...</i>

03:48.640 --> 03:51.880
<i>and Tobias had dropped
an intriguing bit of information.</i>

03:52.000 --> 03:54.840
And then, of course, we couldn't conceive,
so there was that famous ordeal.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.480
What do you mean, you couldn't conceive?
Was Maeby adopted?

03:57.600 --> 04:00.520
Is she not really related to me?
Is she just some girl I know?

04:00.640 --> 04:03.200
<i>George Michael never got an answer.
- It's Carl Weathers.</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:06.000
<i>So he set about doing some
investigating on his own.</i>

04:06.080 --> 04:08.240
- Hey, have you ever seen any
pictures of your mom pregnant?

04:08.275 --> 04:09.400
- Don't talk to me about my mom.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.560
She's crazy.
Both of them are.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.360
<i>- Sometimes I wish we
weren't even related.</i>

04:13.395 --> 04:14.560
- Hey, you know, maybe we're not.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.120
Because, I mean, when you think about it,
we don't even really look like each other.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.839
No, I was talking
about my parents.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.280
God, what's wrong
with this family?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.880
Maybe we're not a family.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.120
And maybe that's
very, very right. We...

04:29.240 --> 04:33.760
Uncle Gob.
Hey, uh, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant?

04:33.840 --> 04:38.400
Oh, yeah. Dozens of times.
Hey, is your dad around, or...

04:41.480 --> 04:44.840
- Hey, Gob. Marta call?
- She sure has...

04:44.960 --> 04:47.640
<i>four times,
but I didn't take the calls.</i>

04:47.720 --> 04:49.720
Oh, no? Why not?

04:49.800 --> 04:53.560
- Because of you. You said
to lay low. And it's working.

04:53.595 --> 04:54.239
- Great.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.000
Tell you what, you may
not be good with women,

04:56.035 --> 04:57.760
but you are great with
other people's women.

04:57.880 --> 04:58.685
I'll give you that.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.800
- No! Listen, Gob, you
can't just ignore her.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.200
<i>Maybe you should talk to her.
She is your girlfriend.</i>

05:03.320 --> 05:05.760
Exactly. And I want
to keep it that way.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.100
<i>For all I know, she's
calling to break up with me.</i>

05:08.135 --> 05:10.320
I don't answer the phone,
that doesn't happen.

05:10.400 --> 05:15.040
<i>And it's all because of you, fratello.
That's Italian for brother.</i>

05:15.160 --> 05:17.760
Now all I gotta do
is find this Hermano guy.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.160
<i>- I'm gonna kill him.
- Hey, Brother.</i>

05:20.280 --> 05:21.600
<i>- Hey, Busty.
- Hey, Brother.</i>

05:21.720 --> 05:23.880
- Hey, Buster.
- Gob, there's no need for violence.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.160
<i>There never is. I'd like to think
that we're all intelligent, mature...</i>

05:28.280 --> 05:30.840
adults that can settle
their differences...

05:30.920 --> 05:33.680
whenever they might come to light,
through words.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.920
Yeah, well, I let my fists
do the talking.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.560
Not this one, 'cause obviously,
I need it for coin tricks and stuff.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.800
<i>- But this one, I let it
speak for both of them.</i>

05:40.835 --> 05:41.635
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:41.720 --> 05:45.280
Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball
and remain motionless when confronted.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.600
That's what I did in high school
when I almost got into a fight.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.240
- I think that was about
being attacked by bears.

05:50.275 --> 05:51.075
- Yeah, I know.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.880
Hey, rich kid.
Gimme your lunch money.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.120
But sometimes I wonder what it would
be like to get into a fight today.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.525
- You'd be a much bigger ball.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.080
- There is so much in life
that I have not experienced.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.520
And now that I'm away from Mom,
I feel like this is my chance to live.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.960
I want to dance. I want
to make love to a woman.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.560
I want to get a checking account.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.480
I want to know what
it feels like to get my face socked in.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.920
Michael, don't get that!
That could be Marta!

06:18.040 --> 06:21.120
What? Oop! Too late. Hello?

06:21.240 --> 06:23.400
- Michael?
- Oh, hi, Mom.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.239
- I'm not here.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.600
- Is that Buster? Tell
him I'm fine without him.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.960
Why haven't you called me back?
I'm worried about your father's hearing.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.440
Mom, listen, it's gonna be fine.
I'm on it, okay? I'm taking care of it.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.840
- I'll be there first
thing Friday morning.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.160
- It's tomorrow at 4:30.

06:36.280 --> 06:40.040
- Oh. I should write that down.
- Where is your head, Michael?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.280
Everything's gonna be fine.
They just read the charges...

06:42.400 --> 06:44.520
and we look like a loving family for,
like, six minutes.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.440
- Ten minutes.
- We couldn't get that down, huh?

06:47.520 --> 06:50.600
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
went to speak with Tobias.</i>

06:50.720 --> 06:53.400
- This was just faxed to you.
- Oh, great! The rewrite.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.520
Let's see if they've
beefed up my part.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.760
I got three lines!

06:57.880 --> 06:59.965
So, uh, I've been
thinking about that, uh...

07:00.000 --> 07:02.400
that conversation we were
having the other night...

07:02.520 --> 07:04.920
about, uh, where Maeby
came from, and, uh...

07:05.000 --> 07:07.560
I was just wondering if
you could finish that thought.

07:07.680 --> 07:10.080
Yes, okay.
Uh, well, have a seat.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.960
Uh...

07:14.240 --> 07:16.160
Um...

07:17.600 --> 07:20.080
When a man...

07:20.160 --> 07:25.480
needs to prove to a woman
that he's actually...

07:25.600 --> 07:27.600
When a man loves a woman...

07:27.680 --> 07:31.880
and he actually wants
to make love, uh, to her...

07:32.000 --> 07:35.040
something very,
very special happens.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.360
And, uh, with deep,
deep concentration...

07:38.440 --> 07:42.600
- and-and great focus, he's often
able to achieve an erec... - I'm sorry.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.960
I'm gonna stop you.
I know where you're running.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.240
I- I didn't mean
babies in general.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.005
Oh, well, that's good,

07:49.040 --> 07:52.840
'cause it was about to
get a little, ick, gross.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.120
- Yeah. No, I meant
specifically with Maeby.

07:55.155 --> 07:56.400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.320
- This isn't right.
- I know. You're right.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.520
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It says it's a shower scene.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.960
I'm not supposed to be in a shower scene.
It has nudity.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.880
<i>Tobias was a never-nude,
which is exactly what it sounds like.</i>

08:08.000 --> 08:11.680
I don't do nudity.
It says that right on my résumé. Okay?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.160
What... What do you think
I wear these for?

08:14.240 --> 08:16.560
I was never actually
clear on that.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.560
So, you're, uh...
you're not with Marta anymore?

08:19.680 --> 08:24.120
Well, my plan is to get her wanting me
but bad, and then I spring it on her.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.680
I know you've been cheating on me,
and you just cost yourself one fine man...

08:27.800 --> 08:30.760
- and one fine CD of him
singing "Love is in the Air. "

08:30.795 --> 08:32.280
- Well, I would never, uh...

08:32.360 --> 08:35.320
do this while you were
still going out, but, uh...

08:35.440 --> 08:38.559
if you're done with her,
I'd sure like a crack at her.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.640
Right, right.
That sounds great. Go for it, buddy.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.560
But you know that she's kind of
used to being with me, right?

08:44.640 --> 08:48.560
So, it'd be sort of like
going from prime rib to...

08:48.640 --> 08:51.840
I don't know...
weird brother of prime rib.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.800
- Do you even know her?
- I met her. I fell for her.

08:54.880 --> 09:00.320
<i>I've been watching her program, El Amor
Prohibido... The Love That Is Forbidden.</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:02.600
<i>She is the love that's forbidden.</i>

09:02.720 --> 09:04.920
<i>The love of my hermano.</i>

09:05.000 --> 09:07.640
Wait a second. What?
You know Hermano?

09:07.720 --> 09:12.680
<i>"Hermano" is brother in Spanish.
As in, "Hey, hermano. "</i>

09:12.800 --> 09:15.160
- Huh.
- Brother?

09:15.240 --> 09:18.120
<i>- Hermano means brother?
- Yeah.</i>

09:18.240 --> 09:22.560
<i>Well, sounds like hermano
is about to get his ass kicked.</i>

09:22.680 --> 09:25.360
Well, this is what I said I wanted.

09:25.440 --> 09:30.720
So, all right.
Let's get it over with. Huh!

09:35.360 --> 09:37.640
Uh, so, are you gonna hit me?

09:37.760 --> 09:41.760
No, I'm not gonna hit you. You're not
the brother Marta's cheating on me with.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.320
- Oh. Oh, who is?
- How the hell should I know, Buster?

09:45.440 --> 09:49.120
You know, there is a guy who plays
her older brother on her show.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.440
I think his name is Tio.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.440
Tio.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.360
Well, sounds like someone who you
think's name is Tio...

09:57.440 --> 09:59.840
is about to get his ass kicked.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.040
Thanks for the tip, Buster.

10:03.160 --> 10:05.160
All right, Mom. I'll
be sure to tell Buster.

10:05.195 --> 10:06.960
Right. Bye. Mom wanted me to tell you...

10:07.040 --> 10:09.520
that she doesn't care whether you
live or die, but if you're not dead...

10:09.600 --> 10:11.680
she would like to see you at the
courthouse tomorrow in the blue sweater.

10:11.800 --> 10:12.885
- Damn! I hate the blue sweater.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.720
- She said it would look
nice with the gray pants.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.200
- Damn it! She's right!
- Where's Gob?

10:17.280 --> 10:20.560
- I think he's heading down to
the set of Marta's soap opera.

10:20.595 --> 10:21.079
- What?

10:21.080 --> 10:23.960
She may be cheating on him
with the guy who plays her brother.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.480
I mean, I still like her,
but we're gonna have to deal with this.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.400
- I gotta go stop him.
- And I've got a blue sweater to steam.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.240
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.160
<i>Gob raced to confront Tio,
with Michael in hot pursuit.</i>

10:39.720 --> 10:41.389
<i>George Michael, having failed to get</i>

10:41.390 --> 10:43.400
the information he
needed from anyone else...

10:43.520 --> 10:47.160
<i>made the ultimate sacrifice and went
to the keeper of the family secrets.</i>

10:47.240 --> 10:51.200
- So, uh, it's about Maeby.
- Oh! That's a lost cause.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.560
- But you get what you pay for, huh?
- Yeah.

10:54.640 --> 10:58.520
- Wait. What-What do you mean, "pay"?
- Fertility tests, lab fees...

10:58.640 --> 11:00.520
donors and implants.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.360
She's not real.
She was made in a cup.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.720
Like soup... a hundred and thirty
thousand dollar cup of soup.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.400
How do you like them egg rolls,
Mr. Goldstone?

11:10.520 --> 11:13.720
All I know is it took an extra year
before we could add a den.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.440
So are you saying we're
not directly related?

11:16.520 --> 11:20.640
I'm saying she already spent
her inheritance getting here.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.760
<i>Gob, meanwhile, had finally
shown up at the El Amor Prohibido set.</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:31.680
Hey, guy. They tell me you're the actor
who plays Marta's brother, Tio.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.457
<i>- ? Cómo?</i>

11:32.458 --> 11:34.920
- Oh, you're gonna be
in a coma, all right.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.920
<i>Unfortunately, the actor who played Tio...</i>

11:38.040 --> 11:42.080
<i>had also starred in a Mexican film
about the life of Oscar De La Hoya.</i>

11:44.920 --> 11:47.160
Gob. Hey, hey.

11:47.240 --> 11:52.120
- You all right? - Where am I? Am I
in... two-thirds of a hospital room?

11:52.200 --> 11:54.600
Yeah, listen, um...

11:56.320 --> 11:59.280
It's me.

12:01.240 --> 12:06.080
<i>I'm the guy that she likes.
"Hermano" is brother.</i>

12:06.200 --> 12:08.080
Me.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.200
- Well, if I'd known it was
you, I wouldn't have minded.

12:13.235 --> 12:14.035
- You wouldn't?

12:14.040 --> 12:17.120
Michael, you're a great guy.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.680
If you liked her, I would have said,
"Go for it. "

12:22.440 --> 12:25.080
I do kind of like her.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.640
Go for it.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.920
Hi.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.680
My brother said
we can do it.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.640
That didn't come out as romantic
as I'd hoped, but...

12:50.200 --> 12:53.400
Everything is finally perfect.

12:53.480 --> 12:58.280
Oh, wait. You jinxed it.
Don't worry. I'll turn it off.

12:58.400 --> 13:03.360
Mm. It's just my mother. She's probably
worried about my Dad's... hearing.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.400
Oh. With my Dad,
it is the vision.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.520
<i>Meanwhile, Tobias told Lindsay
that he couldn't do the part.</i>

13:09.600 --> 13:10.800
- It plays naked, okay?

13:10.840 --> 13:13.760
- Tobias, we're gonna have
to deal with this sometime.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.880
I understand you not
wanting to do it on film...

13:16.000 --> 13:18.720
- but you can't even get
undressed in front of me.

13:18.755 --> 13:20.120
- It is not you, Lindsay.

13:20.200 --> 13:24.280
I can't get undressed alone.
I can't get undressed by myself.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.645
I mean, this is a real affliction.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.680
I'm sorry it's not
recognized here in the states.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.400
But I know for a fact that there are
two members of German Parliament.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.320
<i>They're called
"nein wohlstandig" nude.</i>

13:33.440 --> 13:34.605
But they're German, so...

13:34.640 --> 13:37.000
They speak German, so
they have a different...

13:37.120 --> 13:41.840
Yeah, well, it's not normal, and
ignoring it isn't gonna make it go away.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.800
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.640
Please, please don't make fun.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.000
I'm not making fun.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.760
Look, how 'bout we
do this together?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.840
You take off your shirt,
and I'll take off my jacket.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.146
You know, this family can be
pretty screwed up sometimes.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.200
But the good news is...

14:05.280 --> 14:09.840
Actually, I used to think that, too,
but it's better than the alternative.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.560
Well, have you explored
all the alternatives?

14:11.595 --> 14:13.040
'Cause I guess what I'm getting at is...

14:13.120 --> 14:15.360
No, but I'm glad I have
this family, you know?

14:15.440 --> 14:16.805
'Cause I know I said some bad stuff,

14:16.840 --> 14:18.720
but it's much better here
than it was in Boston.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.243
<i>And I have a cousin here.</i>

14:20.244 --> 14:23.200
So even if my parents do get
divorced, I have you, right?

14:23.320 --> 14:26.920
<i>George Michael realized
that no matter how much it upset him...</i>

14:27.040 --> 14:28.960
<i>he didn't want to take
Maeby's family away from her.</i>

14:29.080 --> 14:33.360
- Yeah, you got us all right.
- Now all I need is a boyfriend.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.840
<i>Lucille was left alone
with her oldest son at the courthouse.</i>

14:43.960 --> 14:46.000
just you and me, huh?

14:46.080 --> 14:50.160
God, why am I the only one who
ever comes through in this family?

14:50.240 --> 14:52.280
<i>And George Sr. was led into the courtroom.</i>

14:52.400 --> 14:55.600
- Where the hell is everybody?
- I'm here, Dad.

14:55.680 --> 14:59.280
I can't believe no one showed up.
I don't know. Maybe it's for the best.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.640
Maybe I should just stay in prison
so my family can be free.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.840
- Look, you're my husband, and
you belong back at home with me.

15:05.875 --> 15:06.279
- Wow.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.080
- You really love me.
- Call it what you want.

15:09.160 --> 15:11.520
I'm tired of paying Lupe
to clean one dish.

15:11.640 --> 15:15.600
<i>I'm sorry, sorry. I'm so late.
I had another hearing.</i>

15:15.680 --> 15:21.040
I think I'm gonna
get off, huh? I have a good lawyer.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.280
You look great in red. Okay.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.320
"Anyhoo," what are we doing here?
What's the plan?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.040
The plan? You're our lawyer.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.440
It's a figure of speech.
You're gonna be fine.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.040
Oh, for God's sake. He's on his own
for two days, and he joins a gang.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.400
These guys?
Oh, I've got them for the afternoon.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.640
Besides, they're the only thing
I have left to live for in this world.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.840
Oh, stop being so dramatic.
You know where I live.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.480
I wasn't talking about you, Mom.
I was talking about Marta.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.280
Excuse me.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.320
You were serious? 'Cause
I got news for you, pal.

16:00.355 --> 16:02.400
Marta's been interested in Michael.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.800
That's right... dull,
nothing-going-on-upstairs...

16:08.320 --> 16:11.040
- Michael.
- Yeah, I know.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.680
- I saw them making out at her front door.
- What? When?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.880
just now. Huh!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.920
The stuff I've got to work out with Marta
just keeps piling up.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.880
- Unbelievable.
- All rise.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.840
<i>This court is now in session,
the Honorable Lionel Ping presiding.</i>

16:25.920 --> 16:28.480
- Oh! We've got Ping.
- I want to remind you...

16:28.600 --> 16:31.920
that there are no cameras
allowed in my courtroom.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.320
<i>Conspiracy, racketeering,
evidence tampering...</i>

16:35.400 --> 16:38.840
fraud, theft,
grand theft, petty theft...

16:38.960 --> 16:42.240
- Wow. I-I did not get that page.
- resisting arrest...

16:42.360 --> 16:44.240
<i>- Michael.
- resisting arrest at the scene.</i>

16:44.320 --> 16:45.205
- How dare you!

16:45.240 --> 16:48.800
- Now, come on. You said it
was okay. And nothing happened!

16:48.920 --> 16:51.240
<i>- Oh, did I?
- Take it easy.</i>

16:51.360 --> 16:53.240
<i>- Order!
- Is that my belt?</i>

16:53.320 --> 16:57.840
<i>- Well, so what? Get your hands off me!
- What is your problem?</i>

17:00.400 --> 17:05.240
What are you doing? What's
the matter with you? Get off him! George!

17:05.319 --> 17:07.800
<i>George Sr., having never
heard his charges...</i>

17:07.920 --> 17:11.000
<i>listed consecutively in one sitting,
panicked and ran with great intensity.</i>

17:11.079 --> 17:14.880
<i>Michael and Gob continued their fight
onto the courthouse steps.</i>

17:14.960 --> 17:16.920
Stop it before someone
gets hit in the face!

17:17.040 --> 17:21.680
<i>Buster realized this was his opportunity
to fulfill a longtime fantasy.</i>

17:21.760 --> 17:25.040
Oh, for God's sake! Barry!

17:25.119 --> 17:28.840
<i>Barry, too, felt overwhelmed by the
charges leveled against his client...</i>

17:28.960 --> 17:30.125
<i>- and also took flight.</i>

17:30.160 --> 17:33.120
- What are you doing? They'll
add ten years to your sentence.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.280
They'll never catch me!

17:35.360 --> 17:39.160
<i>Oh, good. We better get you
back in your cell.</i>

17:39.240 --> 17:43.000
It's gettin' kind of crazy out there.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.480
<i>Back at the model home, things were
heating up for Lindsay and Tobias as well.</i>

17:47.560 --> 17:51.840
<i>- I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
- For me, Tobias.</i>

17:54.760 --> 17:56.640
<i>That too.</i>

18:00.640 --> 18:05.440
<i>- You did it.
- Now what?</i>

18:05.560 --> 18:08.440
<i>- Now this.
- And for the first time in years...</i>

18:08.560 --> 18:10.800
<i>Lindsay and Tobias became intimate.</i>

18:10.880 --> 18:13.840
<i>The brothers'fight, meanwhile,
continued into the park...</i>

18:13.920 --> 18:16.320
<i>with Buster still hoping
to take a punch.</i>

18:16.440 --> 18:18.800
- I'll kill you!
- Oh, God!

18:18.880 --> 18:21.240
<i>- Go, go, go, go!
- Lucille had decided that perhaps...</i>

18:21.320 --> 18:23.960
<i>she was better off
without any of them.</i>

18:24.040 --> 18:26.720
- Me! Me, me, me!
- Buster, get out of the way!

18:26.840 --> 18:29.280
Hit me in the face!
Hit me in the face! Hit me in the face!

18:29.400 --> 18:31.480
<i>- Please! Hit me in the face!
- No! Buster!</i>

18:31.600 --> 18:33.880
<i>- Aah! Buster!
- While Marta...</i>

18:33.960 --> 18:37.680
<i>who'd been told the hearing would last
10 minutes, got tired of waiting.</i>

18:37.760 --> 18:40.040
Hey! Hey!

18:40.160 --> 18:42.680
- Marta.
- Marta.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.960
What is wrong with you? I thought you were
good people. I thought you were noble.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.880
I thought you cared about family,
but you clearly don't.

18:52.120 --> 18:55.760
I- It's over.
Both of you. It's over.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.840
Wait, wait.
What about, what about me?

18:57.920 --> 19:00.240
I'm sorry.
I'm not totally sure who you are.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.600
Wow! Wow.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.080
That's what it feels like
to get punched in the face.

19:06.160 --> 19:11.040
- Can you believe that?
- Yeah, lecturing us about family.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.040
I mean, who needs that?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.280
And what are we doing?
Hey, we're brothers.

19:16.360 --> 19:20.960
- That's gotta count for something.
- That counts for everything.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.480
- I'm not gonna throw
it away over some woman.

19:23.515 --> 19:25.160
- Heh! Especially not my woman.

19:25.280 --> 19:25.639
- Hmm?

19:25.640 --> 19:29.400
- But you're right, you're right.
I mean, this is what's real.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.600
- This is what lasts.
Everything else is just petty.

19:32.635 --> 19:34.240
- Yeah, totally beneath us.

19:34.320 --> 19:34.599
- Yeah.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.080
- And by the way, I don't know
how you call her your woman...

19:37.160 --> 19:41.640
when she clearly prefers me, and she was
all prepared to be my girlfriend...

19:41.760 --> 19:42.725
- calling me her boyfriend...

19:42.760 --> 19:44.480
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Hey!

19:44.560 --> 19:45.239
- Hang on one second.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.320
- This is all moot, because she
never got a chance to know me.

19:47.400 --> 19:52.920
Now, will someone please have the decency
to punch me in the face?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.160
Aah!

20:01.280 --> 20:03.760
- Well, it's effective.
- Yeah, it really is.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.120
<i>On the next
Arrested Development.</i>

20:07.200 --> 20:09.280
<i>Tobias quietly overcompensates.</i>

20:09.400 --> 20:12.560
Please tell me
there's some coffee left.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.400
Give me some.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.880
I slept very well
last night.
