-You do?

25:54.321 --> 25:57.393
No ice at all

26:04.241 --> 26:11.352
Yes, if you pass the guy in it, then you are participating
.

28:36.361 --> 28:41.355
You need to practice more.

28:45.361 --> 28:49.354
Thank you, I know what to do

28:55.281 --> 29:03.199
Sometimes I  as well as he,
very aggressive, not afraid at all

29:03.361 --> 29:07.274
A true warrior

29:31.401 --> 29:35.235
He said what?

29:36.401 --> 29:42.397
You have to fight more.
If you fall down, stand up

29:43.201 --> 29:46.352
If you fail to exercise harder

29:46.401 --> 29:52.317
It is the only way to survive

29:52.321 --> 29:57.236
it should make us respect their

29:57.361 --> 30:05.359
From then up to a gang of his own

30:07.201 --> 30:13.231
Yes, he was right

30:14.241 --> 30:19.269
Good luck

31:04.281 --> 31:06.351
We then agreed  which

31:06.401 --> 31:09.393
Tao thought you trusted because you understand the work of one of us

31:09.401 --> 31:13.360
-just put straight Matis...
-I do not care, just know...

31:14.161 --> 31:18.279

31:38.241 --> 31:44.237
Haircut He looked different-
-it's time to change then

31:44.281 --> 31:51.312
Well... Bronze is the largest gangs in the region

31:51.361 --> 31:56.196
They are not playing in the street

31:56.321 --> 32:02.191
... But only
martial arts tournament to fight gangs

32:02.201 --> 32:08.390
And Louis is a former champion of my favorite

32:09.201 --> 32:15.197
any Ice-In The "Bloods" also won the high-
- Now it's time to change

32:15.201 --> 32:20.195
I do not think this is a good idea where

32:20.241 --> 32:25.235
Do you know Matis is not signed up to participate?

32:27.201 --> 32:31.160
So have they treated him?

32:31.201 --> 32:36.229
It's possible that they fear

32:37.281 --> 32:42.230
He's like my brothers

32:44.201 --> 32:48.399
-He  Where to Go?

33:44.321 --> 33:49.156

-I heard people ask about us

33:49.201 --> 33:54.355
Seems not-
-Learn who is often regarded as any guy

33:54.401 --> 34:01.273
Hey... do not hit it dead, it's a little scare

34:01.361 --> 34:06.196

38:14.321 --> 38:18.234

47:43.201 --> 47:46.352
Every meal to go play again results

47:49.241 --> 47:53.200
You have to exercise more

47:53.241 --> 47:57.280
And if you fall down, stand up

47:57.321 --> 48:07.151
If he again fails to file his
until victory

48:17.281 --> 48:22.401
So I started fighting,
start with small gangs

48:23.201 --> 48:27.353

01:02:55.361 --> 01:02:56.139
Tao is so worried?

01:02:57.241 --> 01:03:01.200
No, but he was still practicing, hard work than ever

01:03:01.321 --> 01:03:03.198
he wanted to beat us

01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:04.316
If so

you still want to make me worry à? Fuck off

01:03:32.321 --> 01:03:34.357
You have to beat him

01:03:36.281 --> 01:03:38.351
in the tournament

01:03:39.201 --> 01:03:41.237
but then there will be more trouble

01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:46.317
You sure you do right?

01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:48.310
Yes

01:03:53.321 --> 01:03:54.356
Why?

01:03:57.281 --> 01:03:59.237

01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:53.312
and I are ready to fight

01:09:04.361 --> 01:09:07.158
This time it want?

01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:34.395
Everyone spotlight

01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:41.234
I thought this must be larger than

01:09:41.401 --> 01:09:44.154
They expected me to do things expecting

01:09:46.281 --> 01:09:50.354
Something more fun, more spectacular, perhaps?

01:09:51.241 --> 01:09:54.313
Maybe next time, but tonight
this time only

01:09:58.201 --> 01:10:00.192
I talk a bit

01:10:01.241 --> 01:10:03.152
I may here

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:07.200
Not enough time for his nonsense talk

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:36.236
Hey!

01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:39.234
- Here, this his
- Thanks

01:15:39.321 --> 01:15:41.152
that you need it doing?

01:15:41.361 --> 01:15:43.272
Of the time

01:15:43.361 --> 01:15:45.192
Safeguards game?

01:15:55.321 --> 01:15:57.232
At this point I do?

01:15:59.241 --> 01:16:01.232
Tao only to...

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:04.197
Congratulate Mikey

01:16:05.201 --> 01:16:07.192
and wish it luck

01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:12.154
It works pretty well there

01:16:14.281 --> 01:16:16.158
until now

01:16:21.401 --> 01:16:23.278
Now

01:16:25.161 --> 01:16:27.197
s about time

01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:34.154
better tomorrow you should lost

01:16:34.281 --> 01:16:38.194
Otherwise you'll see
less than 6 feet underground you are here

01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:43.237
As Martis was

01:16:45.321 --> 01:16:47.357
good day Nhe  1

01:16:48.201 --> 01:16:49.350
Come

01:16:56.321 --> 01:16:58.312
Everyone is right

01:17:02.281 --> 01:17:06.194
- How best to
- No, Mikey, you're right

01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:12.277
- We will fight to the end
- No retreat, no surrender

01:17:26.201 --> 01:17:30.194
In the city, we are dominated

01:17:30.281 --> 01:17:34.240
everyone vote for us, and
you know why?

01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:38.149
Since  champion is using the "Bloods"

01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:41.199
if you do not win tomorrow

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:44.159
we will lose that title here

01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:48.234
Defeat it, not be lost where there

01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:26.310
Come !

01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:23.158
Mikey!

01:21:23.281 --> 01:21:24.191
Do you have that?

01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:27.279
Or you are right Mikey?

01:21:34.321 --> 01:21:36.312
You want this, right?

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:40.192
This

01:21:40.281 --> 01:21:43.318
you will not escape this time where

01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:50.361
eyebrows and the little guy you will pay the price you

01:22:05.241 --> 01:22:06.356
Mark them away!

01:22:54.201 --> 01:22:55.350
Come ! Dammit!

01:23:05.281 --> 01:23:06.270
Hey!

01:23:39.241 --> 01:23:41.197
Dammit! Come on!

01:23:41.281 --> 01:23:42.236
Get up to!

01:23:46.201 --> 01:23:49.159
Come on! Beat them!

01:24:14.321 --> 01:24:18.200
That is it! I like it here!

01:24:32.281 --> 01:24:33.350
Let them taste it!

01:24:37.241 --> 01:24:40.153
Keep up!

01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:10.152
Okay, about time!

01:25:23.241 --> 01:25:24.276
Dammit!

01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:54.273
I only draw!

01:27:06.361 --> 01:27:09.159
Meet back later!

01:27:35.281 --> 01:27:37.351
I think you need this!

01:27:39.281 --> 01:27:41.272
True that I will need it

01:27:44.321 --> 01:27:46.152
Yes

01:27:46.321 --> 01:27:49.358
It will take hours before they both give me
to care for him

01:27:51.281 --> 01:27:54.353
I think it's better if you have pain medication available

01:27:56.201 --> 01:27:57.316
Mia!

01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:02.153
I remember our nice day!

01:28:11.361 --> 01:28:13.352
Where  Soon

01:28:14.321 --> 01:28:18.200
I will leave here

01:28:18.281 --> 01:28:23.355
I'll have what I want when I want

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:04.394
- Long, long not see you there
- Yes, a long time ago

01:29:32.361 --> 01:29:33.350
Mikey!

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:35.158
By the time it is!

01:30:58.201 --> 01:30:59.270
Why?

01:30:59.401 --> 01:31:02.313
How much I earn from this?

01:31:04.281 --> 01:31:07.193
You go find out for themselves

01:32:01.281 --> 01:32:04.239
Heard  you want to win to get out of here

01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:06.238
Yes

01:32:06.361 --> 01:32:08.317
We are gladiators

01:32:10.201 --> 01:32:14.274
- I will have to face these things
- Those words too big here

01:32:16.201 --> 01:32:21.195
Tao will be the champion,
and nobody will remember you more

01:32:22.361 --> 01:32:24.352
Tao no longer a champion more

01:32:25.281 --> 01:32:29.240
- Tao was here long ago
- Not so both

01:32:29.321 --> 01:32:34.315
As long as you remain champion,
you will have to continue fight

01:32:35.241 --> 01:32:39.200
- You are talking about?
- Just think

01:32:39.241 --> 01:32:42.233
Here there are always new games

01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:48.235
driver  anybody tournaments out there?
Do you think the gang have anything?

01:32:48.321 --> 01:32:51.199
We just use you as puppets only

01:32:53.281 --> 01:32:57.274
We control the entire city,
everyone, even in this

01:32:57.401 --> 01:33:01.155
They follow us everywhere

01:33:06.201 --> 01:33:08.317
We want ?

01:33:09.201 --> 01:33:13.160
Tao said too much then, the answer is not found in this
Where

01:33:14.241 --> 01:33:15.356
there's enough

01:36:23.401 --> 01:36:25.357
The loser then his

01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:29.271
Still he won

01:36:30.321 --> 01:36:35.349
-
He's good here - I'm glad he said it

01:36:36.161 --> 01:36:40.154
Listen sheriff, unfortunately, our people have...
tells how children

01:36:41.281 --> 01:36:43.192
disappear

01:36:43.321 --> 01:36:46.233
Why? You mean the game is killed?
Listen

01:36:46.361 --> 01:36:50.195
this normal, not only here where

01:36:50.281 --> 01:36:53.273
Threats everywhere,
I'm still trying to control it

01:36:53.401 --> 01:36:57.394
but I will try,
sure this happens before I'm on

01:36:58.241 --> 01:37:00.232
Flexibility is good

01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:04.314
- but still
not good enough - Anyway, we do not have anything new to the city

01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:10.237
so I have decided to expand this small tournament

01:37:10.321 --> 01:37:12.152
Very much

01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:14.357
And of course we have to find partners

01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:18.238
As a sheriff ,
I control everything in this city

01:37:18.321 --> 01:37:20.152
The city lies in my palm

01:37:20.281 --> 01:37:22.192
I was you

01:37:22.361 --> 01:37:24.192
I see

01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:29.401
I will find him the toughest boxer
, bravest

01:37:31.321 --> 01:37:33.391
But price

01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:36.317
Of course money does not matter

01:37:37.281 --> 01:37:39.351
Do not let me down

01:37:40.201 --> 01:37:41.270
Yes

01:37:43.201 --> 01:37:46.318
- Ta
will get in touch - I hope by that time

01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:08.313
-
Battle or there - Yes

01:38:09.161 --> 01:38:13.070
pretty boy there, it continues to grow,
I have plans for it.

01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:15.270
No problem.

01:38:28.321 --> 01:38:30.198
Miserable this guy!

01:38:31.201 --> 01:38:33.396
You'll never get out of here Where

01:38:38.241 --> 01:38:39.390
<i> If I'm just a puppet. <i/></i>

01:38:40.361 --> 01:38:44.240
<i> It's time to taste and smell of puppets! <i/></i>

01:38:45.321 --> 01:38:47.198
<i> I will be free! <i/></i>

01:38:47.401 --> 01:38:49.232
<i> Beware! <i/></i>
