Oh, thank you. Thank you.

Gosh, uh, do sit down, for goodness' sake.
I might talk for too long.

Gosh, when I was a little boy
and I was first brought here by my mother

02:17:22.050 --> 02:17:25.469
when I was five, I think,
to a Promenade concert,

02:17:25.555 --> 02:17:28.389
I think I heard Beethoven's Third Symphony,

02:17:28.474 --> 02:17:31.852
and I don't think I could have ever,
ever believed,

02:17:31.936 --> 02:17:35.063
sitting somewhere up there,

02:17:35.147 --> 02:17:38.191
that anything like this
would ever happen to my music.

02:17:38.316 --> 02:17:41.361
And I have to thank, immediately,
Cameron Mackintosh.

02:17:41.446 --> 02:17:43.989
What an extraordinary production
he's put together.

02:17:47.743 --> 02:17:49.995
Thank you, Cameron.
We'll meet him in a moment.

02:17:50.663 --> 02:17:55.083
But before I go any further,

02:17:55.168 --> 02:17:57.752
the wonderful thing about musicals is that

02:17:57.837 --> 02:18:00.254
something has to happen
that brings them all together.

02:18:00.339 --> 02:18:05.093
I mean, you can have a really great musical
and one aspect of it could be wrong,

02:18:05.178 --> 02:18:06.178
whether it be the production,

02:18:06.304 --> 02:18:08.888
whether it be something to do with
how it's staged or anything,

02:18:08.973 --> 02:18:11.808
and it might get buried
and then take years to find again.

02:18:11.893 --> 02:18:16.605
But what happened so extraordinarily
with this is that everything came together

02:18:16.689 --> 02:18:18.940
with Cameron as the producer.

02:18:19.025 --> 02:18:21.567
Before we go any further, I have to say that

02:18:21.652 --> 02:18:25.614
it would have never happened
without Maria Björnson, and of course...

02:18:25.698 --> 02:18:28.657
Maria Björnson

02:18:32.621 --> 02:18:36.040
was, as all of you know,
the incredible designer of the show:

02:18:36.125 --> 02:18:39.377
It was her vision combined, I think,
with everything else

02:18:39.504 --> 02:18:43.965
that really brought us along.
She tragically died some years ago.

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:46.635
One of the greatest sadnesses
is that she's not here tonight,

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:49.763
but I hope we've honoured her spirit
in every way.

02:18:49.847 --> 02:18:53.266
So. Maria, thank you.

02:18:57.396 --> 02:18:59.897
And I ought to say,
tonight's rather extraordinary

02:19:00.023 --> 02:19:03.860
because I know that there are
many companies of The Phantom of the Opera

02:19:03.945 --> 02:19:05.946
watching this performance around the world

02:19:06.072 --> 02:19:08.031
because it's being beamed
around the world tonight.

02:19:08.115 --> 02:19:12.201
And none, I suppose, more important
than the director who made it possible,

02:19:12.286 --> 02:19:16.248
who's in New York at the moment

Steve Barton, who of course played Raoul,
and Mary Millar,

02:20:45.504 --> 02:20:50.091

were wonderful members of our original team.
