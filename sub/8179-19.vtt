00:35.334 --> 00:37.285
HELLO?

00:37.353 --> 00:39.554
OH, HEY, JANET.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.572
YEAH, WE GOT OUR TICKETS.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.692
YEAH, WE CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU EITHER.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.295
UH, OK. IT'S YOUR MOM.

00:47.363 --> 00:49.330
SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF WE
STILL LIKE CORN CHEX.

00:50.699 --> 00:53.000
UH, YEAH.

00:53.068 --> 00:55.353
YEAH, THAT'S A GREEN LIGHT
ON THE CORN CHEX.

00:55.421 --> 00:58.256
OK. BYE-BYE, HON.

00:58.323 --> 01:00.859
OK, THAT'S THE 14th CALL
ABOUT OUR TRIP.

01:00.927 --> 01:03.028
YOU KNOW MY MOM. SHE JUST WANTS
IT TO BE GREAT FOR US DOWN THERE.

01:03.095 --> 01:04.613
NO, I KNOW.
I LOVE YOUR MOM.

01:04.712 --> 01:06.431
I JUST WISH SHE DIDN'T
HAVE TO WORK SO HARD

01:06.498 --> 01:08.799
WHEN WE COME THERE.

01:08.867 --> 01:11.269
HEY, MAYBE THIS TIME
WE CAN TAKE THE BURDEN OFF HER

01:11.337 --> 01:14.472
AND STAY IN A HOTEL
OR SOMETHING.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.341
A HOTEL. INTERESTING.

01:17.409 --> 01:18.342
ISN'T IT?

01:18.410 --> 01:19.444
YEAH. YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE WE COULD DO?

01:19.511 --> 01:22.413
WE COULD SMACK HER
IN THE FACE WITH A SHOVEL.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.432
WOULD YOU JUST THINK OF IT
FOR A MOMENT?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.802
I MEAN, WE'D SEE YOUR PARENTS
JUST AS MUCH DURING THE DAY,

01:27.870 --> 01:29.604
GET IN ALL
THAT FAMILY GOODNESS,

01:29.672 --> 01:31.139
AND THEN AT NIGHT
WE'D STAY IN A HOTEL.

01:31.206 --> 01:32.407
WE HAVE A LITTLE PRIVACY,

01:32.474 --> 01:34.376
YOU KNOW,
WITHOUT ALL THEIR STUFF

01:34.443 --> 01:38.179
THAT MAKES US
A LITTLE CRAZY. HEH.

01:38.247 --> 01:40.282
UH, WHAT-WHAT STUFF?

01:40.349 --> 01:41.283
DOUG, COME ON. LIKE-

01:41.350 --> 01:43.735
LIKE THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T
LEAVE THE HOUSE AFTER 8:00

01:43.802 --> 01:45.370
BECAUSE THEY SET THE ALARM

01:45.437 --> 01:49.940
AND IT'S TOO COMPLICATED
TO TEACH US A 4-DIGIT CODE.

01:50.008 --> 01:52.577
FOLLOWED BY "POUND."

01:52.644 --> 01:54.212
AND ONCE
THAT RED LIGHT IS ON,

01:54.279 --> 01:55.329
WE ARE STUCK THERE!

01:55.397 --> 01:58.416
DO YOU KNOW IN PRISON,
THEY CALL THAT LOCKDOWN?

01:58.484 --> 02:00.585
SO NOW STAYING AT
MY PARENTS' IS LIKE PRISON?

02:00.653 --> 02:01.752
NO, BECAUSE IN PRISON

02:01.787 --> 02:05.406
YOU COULD ACTUALLY FLUSH
THE TOILET PAST 8:30.

02:05.474 --> 02:06.458
THEY'RE
LIGHT SLEEPERS, OK?

02:06.525 --> 02:08.592
AND BY THE WAY, I'M NOT
QUITE SURE PRISON

02:08.661 --> 02:10.945
IS THE PARADISE
YOU THINK IT IS.

02:11.013 --> 02:13.164
ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR MOTHER'S
FEELINGS OUT OF THIS FOR A SECOND.

02:13.231 --> 02:14.249
THIS IS ABOUT YOU.

02:14.316 --> 02:16.734
YOU'RE SAYING YOU WOULD
ACTUALLY RATHER STAY

02:16.802 --> 02:19.437
IN YOUR PARENTS'
RETIREMENT COMPLEX

02:19.505 --> 02:20.738
THAN IN A BEAUTIFUL ROOM

02:20.806 --> 02:23.908
STOCKED WITH LIQUOR
AND DIRTY MOVIES?

02:32.768 --> 02:34.969
NO!

02:35.037 --> 02:36.137
BUT WE CAN'T STAY
IN A HOTEL.

02:36.205 --> 02:37.539
OK? WE JUST CAN'T!

02:37.574 --> 02:38.873
LOOK, DOUG-OK, LOOK,

02:38.941 --> 02:41.175
YOUR MOM WILL BE UPSET
FOR A MINUTE, OK,

02:41.210 --> 02:42.644
BUT THEN SHE'LL GET OVER IT,

02:42.712 --> 02:45.079
AND WE'RE ADULTS HERE!
WE'RE IN OUR THIRTIES.

02:45.147 --> 02:46.648
WE'RE ALLOWED TO DO THIS.

02:46.716 --> 02:48.800
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME
YOU FINALLY REALIZED

02:48.867 --> 02:51.819
<i>YOU CAN HAVE COOKIES
BEFORE DINNER.</i>

02:53.322 --> 02:55.589
YOU TOLD ME I COULDN'T
HAVE COOKIES BEFORE DINNER.

02:55.657 --> 02:57.392
YOU CAN'T, OK?

02:57.460 --> 02:59.060
I'M JUST SAYING YOUR PARENTS
AREN'T THE ONES

02:59.128 --> 03:00.128
WHO ARE STOPPING YOU.

03:00.195 --> 03:01.713
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY HEAD IS SPINNING.

03:01.780 --> 03:03.764
IF I GO GET A COOKIE RIGHT
NOW, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME?

03:03.832 --> 03:05.199
DOUG...

03:05.251 --> 03:07.952
PLEASE, HONEY, LET'S JUST
DO THIS THIS ONE TIME, OK?

03:07.970 --> 03:09.120
WE SET THE PRECEDENT.

03:09.187 --> 03:11.155
WE NEVER HAVE TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN.

03:11.223 --> 03:12.674
I WILL DIAL THE NUMBER
FOR YOU, OK?

03:12.741 --> 03:14.575
YOUR FINGERS DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO TOUCH THE BUTTONS.

03:14.643 --> 03:15.644
PLEASE? COME ON, HONEY.

03:15.711 --> 03:16.961
COME ON. I'M CALLING.

03:18.163 --> 03:20.548
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

03:20.616 --> 03:23.568
SHE'LL BE FINE,
I PROMISE.

03:23.635 --> 03:25.102
HEY, MOM.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.771
UH, LOOK, CARRIE
AND I WERE TALKING,

03:26.838 --> 03:28.706
AND WE NEED TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

03:28.774 --> 03:30.925
UH, WE'VE...

03:30.992 --> 03:33.994
KIND OF TURNED AGAINST
THE CORN CHEX.

03:39.601 --> 03:41.502
YOU KNOW WHAT SKILL
I REALIZED I HAVE?

03:41.570 --> 03:43.371
I CAN TELL WHO'S DOING
THE VOICE-OVER

03:43.438 --> 03:44.472
ON ANY COMMERCIAL.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.775
AND I'M NOT TALKIN' JAMES
EARL JONES FOR VERIZON.

03:46.842 --> 03:48.342
ALL RIGHT? THAT'S KID STUFF.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.479
I'M TALKIN' LISA KUDROW
FOR AQUAFINA.

03:51.547 --> 03:53.981
YEAH, IT'S HER.

03:54.049 --> 03:55.200
YOU WANNA TALK SKILLS?

03:55.267 --> 03:58.903
I CAN ALWAYS TELL WHETHER
A DOG IS A GIRL OR A BOY.

03:58.971 --> 03:59.971
YOU MEAN, WITHOUT
LOOKING UNDERNEATH?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.188
YEAH, SEE, THAT'S
WHAT MAKES IT A SKILL.

04:01.256 --> 04:04.275
SEE, OTHERWISE,
IT'S JUST LOOKING.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.962
WOW, I REALLY MISSED
THESE CONVERSATIONS

04:08.029 --> 04:09.530
WHEN WE WERE SEPARATED.

04:09.598 --> 04:12.683
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?
SHE AIN'T GOT NO SKILLS?

04:12.751 --> 04:13.735
SHE'S JUST MAD

04:13.803 --> 04:15.570
'CAUSE I'M MAKING HER
GO SKIING FOR A VACATION.

04:15.637 --> 04:16.870
OH, IT'S TOO DAMN COLD.

04:16.939 --> 04:19.190
HEY, WHEN ARE YOU GUYS
GOING ON VACATION?

04:19.257 --> 04:21.041
NEXT WEEK. HE'S DRAGGING ME
UP TO SOME LODGE IN VERMONT.

04:21.108 --> 04:22.076
YEAH, IT'S
GONNA BE GREAT.

04:22.144 --> 04:23.244
FUN FOR US
AND FUN FOR THEM

04:23.312 --> 04:26.214
TO SEE WHAT BLACK PEOPLE LOOK LIKE.

04:26.282 --> 04:28.783
UM, DOUG, COME WITH ME
TO THE SALAD BAR.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.334
WHAT?

04:30.402 --> 04:32.871
COME WITH ME
TO THE SALAD BAR.

04:32.938 --> 04:36.140
UH, I DON'T EAT THE SALAD
WHEN IT'S BROUGHT TO ME.

04:36.207 --> 04:38.676
DEFINITELY NOT MAKIN'
A SPECIAL TRIP FOR IT.

04:38.744 --> 04:40.695
THEY HAVE
A TACO SECTION.

04:40.763 --> 04:42.430
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

04:47.936 --> 04:50.204
OK, WHERE-WHERE'S
THE TACO SECTION?

04:50.272 --> 04:51.906
LISTEN, I LIED, OK?

04:51.974 --> 04:55.175
YOU LIED?
OK, I'M A PERSON.

04:55.243 --> 04:57.329
DOUG, LISTEN TO ME.
DEACON AND KELLY

04:57.396 --> 05:00.898
ARE GOING ON VACATION
THE SAME TIME AS US.

05:00.966 --> 05:02.567
SO? SO IF WE TALK THEM INTO GOING

05:02.635 --> 05:04.685
TO FLORIDA
WITH US INSTEAD,

05:04.753 --> 05:06.521
WE CAN'T STAY AT
YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

05:06.588 --> 05:07.855
THEY DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH ROOM FOR US!

05:07.923 --> 05:09.757
WE HAVE TO STAY
IN A HOTEL!

05:09.825 --> 05:11.992
YOU SEE? THAT WAY, YOUR
PARENTS ARE NOT OFFENDED,

05:12.060 --> 05:13.494
AND WE SET
OUR PRECEDENT,

05:13.562 --> 05:15.095
AND
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY!

05:15.163 --> 05:16.263
OH, MY GOD,
THEY'RE LOOKING.

05:16.331 --> 05:18.516
GET SOME SALAD,
GET SOME SALAD.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.168
OK, BUT DEACON AND KELLY AREN'T
GONNA CHANGE THEIR VACATION

05:21.236 --> 05:22.570
JUST SO WE DON'T HAVE
TO STAY AT MY PARENTS'.

05:22.638 --> 05:24.439
I KNOW. WE DON'T
TELL THEM THAT PART.

05:24.506 --> 05:27.224
WE JUST SAY, "YOU KNOW, WE
HAVEN'T ALL GONE AWAY TOGETHER

05:27.292 --> 05:28.960
SINCE YOU GUYS
GOT BACK TOGETHER,"

05:29.028 --> 05:30.594
HOW IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE FOURSOME,

05:30.663 --> 05:31.963
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

05:32.031 --> 05:33.414
KELLY DOESN'T WANNA
GO TO VERMONT ANYWAY.

05:33.482 --> 05:35.166
SHE'LL BE ALL OVER THIS!

05:35.233 --> 05:36.317
THIS COULD WORK.

05:36.385 --> 05:37.768
HEY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

05:37.836 --> 05:39.520
I- I DON'T KNOW. I PANICKED.
I WENT ALL BABY CORN.

05:39.588 --> 05:41.305
ALL RIGHT, PUT SOME DRESSING
ON, PUT SOME DRESSING ON!

05:41.340 --> 05:43.408
OK. ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.143
BUT DON'T SIT TOO CLOSE TO ME, 'CAUSE I'M
GONNA ACCIDENTALLY KNOCK THIS ON THE FLOOR.

05:46.211 --> 05:47.144
OK. COME ON.

05:52.234 --> 05:54.068
SO, LOOK AT US,

05:54.136 --> 05:55.970
ALL FOUR OF US
TOGETHER.

05:56.038 --> 05:58.072
THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS GREAT.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.974
I WONDER WHAT ELSE
WE COULD DO?

06:03.012 --> 06:05.379
YOU SEE? I TOLD YOU
THIS WOULD WORK OUT.

06:05.447 --> 06:06.647
I GUESS YOUR MOTHER
DIDN'T TAKE US

06:06.715 --> 06:08.749
STAYING AT THE HOTEL
TOO HARD, HUH?

06:11.670 --> 06:13.788
I SAID, "HUH?"

06:15.891 --> 06:18.359
OH, MY GOD!

06:18.427 --> 06:20.995
I TRIED TO TELL HER.
I COULDN'T!

06:21.063 --> 06:22.280
THERE THEY ARE!

06:22.348 --> 06:24.365
HI, KIDS! HI! HEY!

06:24.433 --> 06:26.701
OHH!
HI!

06:26.768 --> 06:28.536
HI, HOW YOU DOIN', DAD?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

06:28.603 --> 06:30.771
HI, SWEETHEART.
HI.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.906
YOU KIDS LOOK GREAT!

06:31.974 --> 06:33.607
DON'T THEY
LOOK GREAT, JOE?

06:33.876 --> 06:34.742
WHY AREN'T YOU STANDING UNDER THE CHUTE

06:34.810 --> 06:36.994
WHERE THE BAGS COME OUT? WHAT?

06:37.012 --> 06:37.861
NOW WE'LL BE STUCK
AT THE OTHER END

06:37.929 --> 06:39.480
OF THE CAROUSEL
IN SIBERIA!

06:39.548 --> 06:40.481
GET COMFORTABLE,
PEOPLE.

06:40.549 --> 06:41.615
WE'RE GONNA
BE HERE ALL DAY.

06:41.684 --> 06:43.484
WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE HERE ALL DAY.

06:43.552 --> 06:46.087
NO, WE'RE NOT, BECAUSE I'M GONNA
SHIMMY MY WAY UNDER THE CHUTE.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.705
DOUG, YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE
SITTIN' AROUND, GRAB IT.

06:47.772 --> 06:49.090
I'M NOT
COUGHING UP 2 BUCKS

06:49.158 --> 06:51.826
FOR A GLORIFIED
SHOPPING CART.

06:51.894 --> 06:53.961
YOU KIDS
MUST BE TIRED.

06:54.029 --> 06:55.262
WE'LL GO HOME,
WE'LL HAVE LUNCH,

06:55.330 --> 06:57.398
AND THEN YOU
CAN TAKE A NICE NAP.

06:57.465 --> 07:00.134
OH, BY THE WAY,
GOOD NEWS.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.654
COSTCO WAS WILLING
TO SWAP THE CORN CHEX

07:02.721 --> 07:05.022
FOR THE RICE CHEX
EVEN-STEVENS.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.108
WHEW!
CRISIS AVERTED!

07:07.176 --> 07:09.276
YEAH!
YEAH.

07:09.344 --> 07:10.995
ISN'T THAT
YOUR FRIEND DEACON?

07:11.063 --> 07:13.514
WHO? WHICH ONE?

07:13.582 --> 07:15.666
RIGHT THERE,
NEXT TO KELLY.

07:16.434 --> 07:17.618
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYIN'.

07:17.686 --> 07:20.087
I REALLY DON'T.

07:20.155 --> 07:21.522
UM, HERE'S
THE THING:

07:21.590 --> 07:23.224
YEAH, WE, UH-

07:23.292 --> 07:25.359
WE ALL DECIDED TO GO
ON VACATION TOGETHER.

07:25.427 --> 07:27.211
WE KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE THE
ROOM FOR ALL FOUR OF US,

07:27.279 --> 07:28.947
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
STAY AT A HOTEL.

07:29.014 --> 07:30.514
NO BIG WHOOP.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.200
OH.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.103
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

07:41.910 --> 07:44.244
WELL, THAT WAS
THE WORST CAR RIDE EVER.

07:44.312 --> 07:47.347
WHAT? I DON'T THINK YOUR
MOTHER TOOK IT THAT BAD.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.450
SHE REFUSED TO PUT ON
HER SEAT BELT.

07:49.518 --> 07:52.586
SHE SAID,
"WHAT'S THE POINT?"

07:52.654 --> 07:54.155
OK, SHE WAS
A LITTLE RATTLED,

07:54.222 --> 07:55.489
BUT SHE'LL
GET OVER IT, OK?

07:55.558 --> 07:58.009
HONEY, COME ON. PLEASE JUST
REMEMBER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.244
I MEAN, LOOK AROUND.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.413
WE ARE IN A HOTEL ROOM

08:02.481 --> 08:04.949
IN FLORIDA. OK?

08:05.017 --> 08:06.250
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THIS. LOOK.

08:06.318 --> 08:09.620
WE GOT A TV
THAT SWIVELS...

08:09.688 --> 08:12.540
AND SOME PAINTING
OF SOME...

08:12.607 --> 08:15.376
MYSTICAL DOLPHINS...

08:15.444 --> 08:17.078
AND WHEN WE GET BORED
LOOKIN' AT THAT,

08:17.146 --> 08:18.212
WE CAN GO DOWNSTAIRS

08:18.280 --> 08:20.548
AND HAVE A LITTLE DRINK
AT CAP'N TOBY'S.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.217
ACTUALLY, I SAW
THAT THEY LET YOU

08:23.285 --> 08:24.985
THROW YOUR PEANUT SHELLS
ON THE GROUND.

08:25.053 --> 08:28.456
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO TRY THAT.

08:28.523 --> 08:31.292
YOU SEE? NOW YOU'RE
THINKIN', HONEY!

08:31.360 --> 08:33.159
OK. SO WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DO FIRST?

08:33.227 --> 08:34.528
ANYTHING.
JUST NAME IT.

08:34.596 --> 08:36.530
ANYTHING?
ANYTHING.

08:36.597 --> 08:39.832
YOU'D WATCH A MOVIE
STARRING THE ROCK WITH ME?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.186
I WOULD LOVE TO.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.441
HEY! HELLO. HEY.

08:47.509 --> 08:48.843
NICE HOTEL YOU PICKED.

08:48.910 --> 08:51.045
UH, THE AIR-CONDITIONING
IN OUR ROOM?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.247
NOT WORKING.

08:53.314 --> 08:55.767
OH, WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD CALL DOWNSTAIRS-

08:55.834 --> 08:57.352
AND GET ANOTHER ROOM?
YEAH, ALREADY TRIED THAT.

08:57.419 --> 09:00.371
THEY'RE ALL BOOKED.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.807
YOU KNOW WHERE YOU DON'T
NEED AIR-CONDITIONING?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.508
VERMONT.

09:13.635 --> 09:17.922
I'M SURE SOMETIMES YOU NEED
AIR-CONDITIONING IN VERMONT.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.425
YEAH, I THINK YOU DO. I
THINK HE'S JUST EXAGGERATING.

09:20.492 --> 09:21.492
ALL RIGHT, HONEY,
COME ON.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.327
YOU PICK A LITTLE SNACK
FROM THE MINI-BAR,

09:23.395 --> 09:25.696
AND LET'S WATCH THE ROCK

09:25.764 --> 09:28.782
BE A NEUROSURGEON
WHO SAVES THE PRESIDENT.

09:43.131 --> 09:46.367
SPRING BREAK 2004
IS ON!

09:48.036 --> 09:49.203
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
HOW THIS WORKS, PEOPLE.

09:49.270 --> 09:50.971
I CALL YOUR SCHOOL,
YOU POUND A BEER

09:51.039 --> 09:53.907
AND SCREAM LIKE HELL!
ARE WE READY?

09:56.394 --> 09:59.380
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

09:59.447 --> 10:01.516
THAT'S CRAZY. HOW CAN HE NOT HEAR THAT?

10:03.335 --> 10:05.085
I'LL JUST TURN IT
UP A LITTLE BIT.

10:05.153 --> 10:06.186
THERE YOU GO.

10:06.254 --> 10:08.789
MICHIGAN STATE!

10:11.326 --> 10:14.261
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND!

10:15.730 --> 10:16.797
OK, WELL,

10:16.865 --> 10:20.068
THERE'S 9.95
I'LL NEVER SEE AGAIN.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.604
YEAH?

10:26.975 --> 10:31.011
YOU KNOW WHERE KIDS
DON'T GO FOR SPRING BREAK?

10:31.079 --> 10:32.847
VERMONT.

10:39.921 --> 10:41.922
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS!

10:46.194 --> 10:47.678
HONEY, COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

10:47.746 --> 10:50.748
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. WE HAVE
OUR OWN DISCO IN THE ROOM!

10:50.816 --> 10:52.550
HUH? COME ON!

10:52.617 --> 10:54.051
SHAKE THAT THING, BABY!

10:54.386 --> 10:55.019
I DON'T REALLY-
DO IT FOR ME, FOR ME!

10:55.086 --> 10:56.270
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT!
YOU KNOW I LOVE IT!

10:56.337 --> 10:57.271
COME ON,
DO IT FOR ME!

10:57.338 --> 10:58.272
DO IT FOR ME,

10:58.339 --> 10:59.774
COME ON, SHAKE IT!
SHAKE THAT THING!

10:59.841 --> 11:02.342
SHAKE THAT THING!
SHAKE THAT THING!

11:02.411 --> 11:03.844
YEAH! YEAH!

11:03.912 --> 11:05.245
I DON'T WANNA,
I DON'T WANNA!

11:05.313 --> 11:06.480
I- YOU KNOW,
I WANNA RELAX.

11:06.548 --> 11:08.031
YOU WANNA RELAX?
OK, HOW 'BOUT THIS?

11:08.099 --> 11:09.766
HOW 'BOUT THIS? WE JUST
FRESHEN UP A LITTLE BIT,

11:09.835 --> 11:12.703
WE GO DOWNSTAIRS, WE TIP
ONE BACK WITH CAP'N TOBY?

11:12.770 --> 11:14.538
COME ON, LET'S
FRESHEN UP. COME ON.

11:14.605 --> 11:15.706
ALL RIGHT.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.480
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:23.549 --> 11:26.684
THERE'S A BAT IN THERE. WHAT?!

11:26.752 --> 11:28.386
THERE IS A BAT
IN THE BATHROOM!

11:28.453 --> 11:30.020
NO!

11:30.088 --> 11:33.707
I'M SORRY.
DID YOU SAY NO?

11:33.775 --> 11:36.460
DOUG, HOW CAN THERE BE
A BAT IN THE BATHROOM?

11:36.528 --> 11:38.412
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A MOTH OR SOMETHING.

11:39.848 --> 11:40.781
AY-YI-YI.

11:42.283 --> 11:43.750
OK, UM,

11:43.819 --> 11:47.087
THERE'S A BAT
IN THE BATHROOM...

11:47.155 --> 11:48.989
AND HE'S A BIG 'UN.

11:49.057 --> 11:51.025
LET'S NOT PANIC,
LET'S NOT PANIC.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.560
I WILL JUST
CALL DOWNSTAIRS,

11:52.627 --> 11:55.729
AND WE WILL JUST GET THIS
TAKEN CARE OF RIGHT AWAY.

11:57.716 --> 11:59.917
YEAH, HI. UM...

11:59.984 --> 12:01.685
WE HAVE A BAT
IN OUR BATHROOM.

12:03.722 --> 12:04.789
NO, IT-

12:04.856 --> 12:06.791
NO, I'M SURE YOU GET
A LOT OF PRANK PHONE CALLS

12:06.858 --> 12:07.958
FROM THE SPRING BREAKERS,

12:08.026 --> 12:09.660
BUT I'M SERIOUS. WE REALLY-

12:11.863 --> 12:13.764
OKEY-DOKE.

12:13.832 --> 12:14.865
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.650
HE TOLD ME TO HAVE
ANOTHER HEINEKEN,

12:16.718 --> 12:18.435
AND HE HUNG UP ON ME.

12:18.503 --> 12:21.088
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M GOING IN THERE MYSELF.

12:23.725 --> 12:25.192
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE HAIR SPRAY?

12:25.259 --> 12:26.611
I'M GONNA SPRAY HIM, OK?

12:26.678 --> 12:28.095
MAYBE IT'LL KILL HIM.

12:28.163 --> 12:30.597
MAYBE IT'LL JUST FREEZE
HIS WINGS OUT LIKE THAT.

12:32.166 --> 12:32.833
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

12:32.901 --> 12:34.952
TAKE THESE. WEAR THESE
FOR PROTECTION.

12:39.274 --> 12:41.108
NOW THE BAT'S GONNA THINK
I'M ELTON JOHN.

12:41.176 --> 12:43.577
LOOK, JUST
WEAR THEM, PLEASE!

12:59.627 --> 13:00.912
DID YOU GET HIM?

13:00.979 --> 13:02.663
I GOT HIM ANGRY.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.550
PIEDMONT COLLEGE!
OHH.

13:09.504 --> 13:11.038
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE
SHAKE THAT THING

13:11.106 --> 13:13.958
AND GET IT OVER WITH?!

13:15.944 --> 13:19.847
SO HOW ARE THINGS
AT YOUR HOTEL?

13:19.915 --> 13:24.184
THERE WAS A GOAT SWIMMING
IN THE POOL THIS MORNING.

13:24.253 --> 13:26.270
DOUG'S REALLY ENJOYING THAT
MINI-BAR, AREN'T YOU, HONEY?

13:26.338 --> 13:28.605
WHAT DID YOU END UP
SETTLING ON? M&Ms?

13:28.673 --> 13:29.874
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
EATIN' FROM THE MINI-BAR?

13:29.942 --> 13:31.625
YOU CAN BUY M&Ms
AT WALGREEN'S

13:31.692 --> 13:33.660
FOR A THIRD
OF THE PRICE!

13:33.728 --> 13:35.595
I THINK I HAVE SOME CHOCOLATE
CHIPS IN THE KITCHEN.

13:35.663 --> 13:37.664
I COULD PUT SOME
IN A BAGGIE FOR YOU.

13:37.732 --> 13:39.533
OH, THAT'S OK.
THANK YOU.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.068
ALL RIGHT.

13:41.136 --> 13:42.803
YOU KNOW, KELLY,
DARLING, IF YOU'RE TIRED,

13:42.871 --> 13:44.538
YOU COULD TAKE A NAP
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.840
SOMEBODY MIGHT
AS WELL USE IT.

13:49.227 --> 13:50.828
YOUR PARENTS
HAVE A GUEST ROOM?

13:50.979 --> 13:52.913
WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT THE
HOTEL? SAVE YOURSELVES.

13:52.981 --> 13:54.648
HELL, NO, IF WE
HAVE TO SUFFER,

13:54.715 --> 13:56.583
THEY HAVE
TO SUFFER, TOO.

13:56.651 --> 13:59.436
DON'T WORRY. WE'RE
NOT STAYING HERE.

13:59.504 --> 14:00.404
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER. DEAC, HERE.

14:00.471 --> 14:01.822
HELP ME CLEAR.

14:06.928 --> 14:10.063
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE
OUT OF THE HOTEL AND STAY HERE.

14:10.131 --> 14:11.766
NO! I DON'T WANT TO.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.100
WELL, I KIND OF DO.

14:13.168 --> 14:14.535
UH, DOUG,

14:14.603 --> 14:17.672
LET'S REMEMBER WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. OK?

14:17.739 --> 14:19.473
WE ARE
SETTING A PRECEDENT

14:19.541 --> 14:22.009
TO STAY IN A HOTEL.

14:22.076 --> 14:24.512
NO ONE SAID IT
WAS GONNA BE EASY.

14:24.813 --> 14:26.897
YOU DID.

14:26.965 --> 14:29.367
YOU SAID AS LONG AS WE GOT DEACON
AND KELLY TO COME DOWN WITH US,

14:29.434 --> 14:31.402
WE'D BE HOME FREE.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.373
WHAT I JUST HEARD

14:36.441 --> 14:38.942
DID NOT
MAKE ME HAPPY.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.562
OH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE TAKING IT
COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.364
YOU INVITED US DOWN HERE JUST SO
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND TIME

14:44.432 --> 14:46.199
WITH YOUR IN-LAWS?

14:46.267 --> 14:47.601
NO. WE INVITED
YOU HERE

14:47.669 --> 14:49.536
BECAUSE
WE ARE A FOURSOME.

14:49.604 --> 14:52.072
YEAH, SEE, THAT'S FUNNY,
'CAUSE WHAT I HEARD

14:52.140 --> 14:53.641
WAS THAT I'M NOT
SKIING DOWN A MOUNTAIN

14:53.708 --> 14:55.809
OF FRESHLY PACKED SNOW
WITH THE WIND IN MY FACE

14:55.877 --> 14:58.412
BECAUSE YOU WANTED
TO SET A PRECEDENT.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.564
AND BECAUSE
WE'RE A FOURSOME!

15:00.631 --> 15:03.367
WHY DOES NOBODY
REMEMBER THIS?!

15:03.435 --> 15:06.153
KIDS, SHOULD I MAKE
SOMETHING FOR LUNCH,

15:06.221 --> 15:08.121
OR HAVE YOU MADE OTHER
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THAT, TOO?

15:08.190 --> 15:09.523
YOU-YOU KNOW WHAT,
MRS. HEFFERNAN?

15:09.591 --> 15:11.692
IF THAT GUEST ROOM
IS STILL AVAILABLE,

15:11.759 --> 15:13.760
WE'D LOVE
TO USE IT TONIGHT.

15:13.828 --> 15:15.829
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL!

15:15.897 --> 15:18.699
YOU'VE MADE ME
VERY, VERY HAPPY.

15:29.978 --> 15:31.712
WELL...

15:31.780 --> 15:33.914
BRUNCH WAS NICE.

15:38.436 --> 15:41.121
NOW, YOU READY
FOR A LITTLE DESSERT?

15:43.875 --> 15:47.110
'CAUSE I'M GONNA GET
ON YOU LIKE HOT FUDGE.

15:47.178 --> 15:48.261
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU, OK?

15:48.329 --> 15:50.831
THERE'S A BAT
IN OUR BATHROOM!

15:50.899 --> 15:53.166
AND THERE'S GONNA BE
SOME LOVIN' IN THE BEDROOM.

15:53.235 --> 15:55.236
STOP IT, OK?!

15:55.303 --> 15:57.338
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING
THAT'S GONE ON HERE?!

15:57.405 --> 15:58.873
I MEAN,
MY MOTHER HATES US.

15:58.940 --> 16:00.607
OUR BEST FRIENDS HATE US.

16:00.675 --> 16:02.126
THIS TRIP HAS TURNED EVIL!

16:02.277 --> 16:04.345
OK, AND FOR WHAT?
WHAT'S IT ALL FOR?

16:05.113 --> 16:08.131
FOR THE PRECEDENT?
OHH!

16:08.199 --> 16:09.683
WOULD YOU STOP
WITH THAT PRECEDENT!

16:09.834 --> 16:13.970
I'M NOT EVEN ENTIRELY SURE
WHAT IT MEANS.

16:14.038 --> 16:16.190
IT MEANS SWEET FREEDOM!

16:16.258 --> 16:17.157
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU
REALLY TELLING ME

16:17.309 --> 16:20.678
YOU CAN'T SPEND 3 DAYS
WITH MY PARENTS?

16:20.745 --> 16:22.929
LET ME FILL YOU IN
ON SOMETHING.

16:22.997 --> 16:24.198
I LIVE EVERY SECOND
OF MY LIFE

16:24.266 --> 16:26.566
WITH AN OLD MAN
WHO GETS CEREAL

16:26.634 --> 16:31.105
BY DIGGING HIS APE-LIKE HANDS
RIGHT INTO THE BOX!

16:31.172 --> 16:34.208
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T NEED TO
BRING MY FATHER INTO THIS, OK?

16:34.275 --> 16:35.259
OH, DON'T I?

16:35.326 --> 16:37.327
THIS IS A MAN
WHO CANCELED OUR CABLE

16:37.395 --> 16:40.997
<i>BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T PAY HIM EVERY
TIME THEY RAN THE MOVIE ARTHUR!</i>

16:45.820 --> 16:47.938
COME ON, HE'S NOT
THAT BAD, DOUG. I MEAN-

16:48.005 --> 16:50.374
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

16:50.441 --> 16:51.542
WHAT-WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.711
I'M PACKING. WE'RE
STAYING AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE

16:53.778 --> 16:54.712
LIKE WE SHOULD'VE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:54.779 --> 16:56.429
NO, DOUG, WE CAN'T!
DEACON AND KELLY

16:56.497 --> 16:58.699
ARE STAYING IN THEIR
GUEST BEDROOM ANYWAY!

16:58.767 --> 17:00.484
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW
WHAT? WE'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR,

17:00.552 --> 17:02.403
OR WE'LL SLEEP IN THE BED
WITH MY PARENTS.

17:02.470 --> 17:04.421
GOD, MY MOTHER
WOULD LOVE THAT.

17:08.693 --> 17:09.709
SO, YOU GOT YOUR WATER,

17:09.861 --> 17:11.395
AND HERE ARE
SOME EXTRA PILLOWS,

17:11.463 --> 17:13.896
AND I PUT SOME TANGERINES IN YOUR ROOM.

17:13.964 --> 17:15.699
NOW, THEY TOLD ME AT THE
MARKET THAT THEY WERE SEEDLESS,

17:15.767 --> 17:18.468
SO IF THEY'RE NOT,
I WANNA KNOW ABOUT IT.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.020
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

17:20.088 --> 17:21.021
WE'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

17:21.089 --> 17:24.191
GOOD NIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU TWO DOIN'?

17:24.258 --> 17:26.326
GREAT.
GOOD.

17:26.394 --> 17:29.045
I'M SO HAPPY
YOU'RE HERE.

17:29.113 --> 17:31.081
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

17:37.355 --> 17:39.222
SYSTEM ARMED.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.860
REMEMBER, DON'T OPEN
ANY DOORS OR WINDOWS.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.261
OKEY-DOKE.

17:52.203 --> 17:55.156
IT'S STILL
A LITTLE LIGHT OUT.

17:56.057 --> 17:57.841
IT'S BEDTIME.

18:19.297 --> 18:21.081
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I HAVE TO PEE.

18:21.149 --> 18:22.933
REMEMBER, DON'T FLUSH.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.034
OH, COME ON.

18:24.101 --> 18:26.653
CARRIE,
IT'S ALMOST 9:15.

18:26.721 --> 18:28.021
JUST...

18:28.089 --> 18:29.923
PEE IN THE TUB.

18:36.014 --> 18:39.984
I AM NOT GOING
TO PEE IN THE TUB, OK?

18:40.051 --> 18:41.068
I BEGGED YOU TO GO
AFTER DINNER!

18:41.136 --> 18:42.769
I DIDN'T
HAVE TO GO THEN!

18:42.837 --> 18:44.004
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU LOST YOUR CHANCE!

18:44.072 --> 18:45.639
FINE. I'LL HOLD IT.

18:47.057 --> 18:48.392
NO, I CAN'T HOLD IT.
I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA GO.

18:48.459 --> 18:50.627
WHOA! WHOA, WHOA.
WAIT A SECOND!

18:50.695 --> 18:52.479
LOOK, THE REC CENTER
DOWN THE HALL

18:52.546 --> 18:53.564
IS OPEN TILL 10:00,
ALL RIGHT?

18:53.631 --> 18:55.599
THEY GOT
A BEAUTIFUL BATHROOM.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.168
WHAT? DOUG, WE
CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR.

18:58.236 --> 19:00.137
THE FRICKIN' ALARM
IS ON!

19:01.990 --> 19:04.925
I MAY KNOW THE CODE.

19:04.993 --> 19:06.777
WHAT?

19:06.845 --> 19:07.877
I HEARD MY PARENTS
TALKING,

19:07.945 --> 19:10.347
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

19:10.415 --> 19:11.464
WELL, WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?

19:11.532 --> 19:13.116
LET'S GO!
OPEN THE DOOR!

19:13.184 --> 19:15.118
BUT YOU GO OUT, YOU DO YOUR
BUSINESS, YOU COME BACK.

19:15.186 --> 19:17.020
NO ONE HAS TO KNOW.
FINE!

19:17.088 --> 19:18.956
ALL RIGHT.

19:19.023 --> 19:20.858
MY BIRTHDAY'S, UH,

19:20.925 --> 19:25.762
FEBRUARY 9, 1965.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.764
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M
LOOSENING UP MY FINGERS!

19:27.832 --> 19:28.966
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

19:28.983 --> 19:30.734
OK...

19:30.802 --> 19:33.286
THAT'S, UH, 2...

19:33.354 --> 19:34.054
WAIT A SECOND. THAT
IS MY BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?

19:34.206 --> 19:35.539
DOUG, YOU DON'T KNOW
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

19:35.607 --> 19:37.107
I BLANKED OUT.
EXCUSE ME!

19:37.175 --> 19:38.542
OK, COME ON.

19:41.079 --> 19:44.982
2... 9... 6... 5...

19:45.050 --> 19:47.384
POUND.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.486
SYSTEM DISARMED.

19:49.554 --> 19:51.838
HONEY,
I LOVE YOU!

19:51.906 --> 19:53.440
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
PEE LIKE THE WIND.

19:53.508 --> 19:54.691
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.560
Intruder detected.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.729
OH, MY GOD! WHAT'S GOING
ON?! I DID IT RIGHT!

19:58.796 --> 20:01.898
IS EVERYBODY OK?!

20:01.966 --> 20:03.116
WHAT HAPPENED?!

20:03.184 --> 20:04.251
I SAW THE ALARM SWITCH OFF!

20:04.318 --> 20:07.320
I HIT THE PANIC BUTTON!
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN HERE!

20:07.388 --> 20:08.872
MA-

20:08.940 --> 20:10.040
THERE'S NOBODY
IN HERE, ALL RIGHT?

20:10.108 --> 20:11.474
I PUNCHED
IN THE CODE.

20:11.542 --> 20:12.993
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT?!

20:13.061 --> 20:16.863
OH, GREAT.

20:16.931 --> 20:17.781

20:17.849 --> 20:19.132

THE REAL COPS?

20:19.200 --> 20:21.501
LOO-NO.

20:21.569 --> 20:23.736
EVERYTHING'S FINE, OK?
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

20:23.804 --> 20:25.089
WHY WOULD YOU FIDDLE
WITH THE ALARM?!

20:25.156 --> 20:27.557
YOU KNOW
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED!

20:27.625 --> 20:30.394
YOU KNOW WHERE THEY DON'T
FIDDLE WITH THE ALARM?

20:32.363 --> 20:33.313
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
IT'S AFTER 9:00.

20:33.381 --> 20:35.049
BACK TO BED. LET'S GO.

20:38.886 --> 20:41.605
I JUST WANTED
TO STAY IN A HOTEL.

20:46.644 --> 20:48.695
I GOT THE FOOD.

20:49.964 --> 20:51.565

WITH THE A.C. WORKING,

20:51.633 --> 20:53.600
I'M NOT HATIN'
