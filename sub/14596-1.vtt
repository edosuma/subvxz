00:29.363 --> 00:30.948
Children, get into place.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.406
You in the back...

00:32.698 --> 00:35.160
In the back, stand up straight!

00:35.619 --> 00:37.704
Get ready for the photo.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.582
Children, please calm down!

00:40.791 --> 00:42.000
Children!

00:42.209 --> 00:44.127
The row in the back, stop moving.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.712
Stand still!

00:45.879 --> 00:47.214
You two over there...

00:48.966 --> 00:52.261
Our teacher gave us
a funny assignment the other day:

00:56.014 --> 00:59.393
"Tell me what you want to be

00:59.810 --> 01:01.562
"when you grow up."

01:10.571 --> 01:12.364
Nicholas, it can't be that hard.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.201
Yes it can, if you don't know
what you want to be.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.288
The other kids, they all know.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.750
Alceste, for example,
he wants to be a minister.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.504
Alceste is my best friend,
a fat boy who's always eating.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.548
That's ham hock.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.466
That's pork loin.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.010
Those are pork chops.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.263
That's pig's snout.
It doesn't look good, but it is.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.516
The reason he wants
to be a minister

01:41.351 --> 01:43.687
is because
they have lots of banquets.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.777
At our house for Christmas,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.656
we're having Granny, Aunt Dorothy
and Uncle Eugene.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.619
At our place, we're having sausage,
turkey and chestnuts.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.874
Later on, Geoffroy will work
with his father.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.461
Hello?

02:09.505 --> 02:10.631
One moment, please.

02:11.006 --> 02:11.757
Yes, hello?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.636
Geoffroy lives in a big house
with a big garden.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.557
He even has a kidney-shaped pool.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.147
Geoffroy's dad is very rich
and buys him anything he wants.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.192
What Geoffroy likes best of all
is dressing up.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.700
Since Geoffroy's dad works a lot,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.453
it's Albert, the butler,
who watches him.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.041
That's Clotaire.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.961
He has a terrific bike.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.465
It's a race bike.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.137
Then why's it got a rack?

02:59.638 --> 03:02.182
I told you, it's a race rack.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.940
Clotaire's dream
is to be a champion cyclist.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.986
Louis XVl was taken
to the scaffold.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.279
Clotaire!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.072
What did I just say?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.283
Clotaire is bottom of the class.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.077
A scaffold?

03:22.452 --> 03:23.662
What's a scaffold for?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.416
For making buildings?

03:30.878 --> 03:31.753
Go to the corner.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.552
He's always getting punished
or deprived of something.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.934
When he gets his report card,
he's deprived of TV and dessert.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.649
When the principal scolds him,
he says:

03:53.358 --> 03:56.862
Your parents deprive themselves
to give you an education!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.116
Of course, getting report cards

04:01.366 --> 04:03.160
is no fun for anyone.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.703
Nicholas...

04:05.037 --> 04:06.496
"Undisciplined. Easily distracted.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.081
"Could do better."

04:08.290 --> 04:10.209
Eudes is the only one
who isn't afraid.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.961
Eudes! "Quarrelsome and aggressive,

04:13.337 --> 04:15.005
"in class and at playtime.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.548
"Fair grades

04:16.757 --> 04:17.882
"in singing."

04:20.344 --> 04:21.887
My father never says a thing.

04:22.137 --> 04:22.888
You know why?

04:24.056 --> 04:26.058
I look him straight in the eye.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.729
Then he signs it and that's that.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.487
What kind of grades are these?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.572
T o bed with no dessert!

04:41.657 --> 04:44.409
I guess he must not have
looked straight enough.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.704
Eudes says he wants to be a bandit.

04:47.871 --> 04:48.872
I want to be a bandit.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.083
Bandit! That's not a profession.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.877
Yes, it is!
If there weren't any bandits,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.130
your father wouldn't have a job
and you'd live in a shack.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.090
Say that again?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.342
You heard me: a rotten shack.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.136
Rufus wants to be a policeman,

05:03.345 --> 05:04.513
like his father.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.726
But talk about goofing up,

05:10.394 --> 05:11.144
he's the champ.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.690
Hey guys, I'll imitate a monster.
Guess who it is?

05:16.692 --> 05:17.901
Frankenstein!
-The Mummy!

05:18.068 --> 05:19.403
Belphegor!
-Dracula!

05:19.778 --> 05:20.821
The bogeyman!

05:21.071 --> 05:22.364
My Aunt Germaine!

05:23.073 --> 05:25.492
No! It's Old Spuds!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.331
Old Spuds is our supervisor.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.667
He's always saying:

05:34.501 --> 05:35.419
Look me in the eye.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.171
And potatoes have eyes too.

05:38.172 --> 05:42.050
I didn't get it at first either.
The older boys explained it to me.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.929
O ld Spuds likes to make us
write sentences.

05:46.138 --> 05:49.349
100 times: "l will not mock
my supervisors by making

05:49.474 --> 05:53.103
"grotesque imitations
which are totally unrealistic."

05:54.229 --> 05:56.982
Agnan is the only one
that'll never happen to.

05:58.317 --> 06:02.487
Agnan is top of the class
and teacher's pet, but above all

06:02.696 --> 06:03.655
he's a dirty rat.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.073
Teacher! Teacher!

06:05.199 --> 06:06.283
They're talking.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.370
We don't like him much,

06:10.579 --> 06:12.456
but we can't hit him,
he's got glasses.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.125
You can't hit me, I've got glasses.

06:16.210 --> 06:19.296
No one knows what Agnan
wants to be when he grows up.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.589
Teacher! He's copying.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.344
When Dad was my age,

06:25.552 --> 06:28.096
there were plenty of things
he wanted to be.

06:29.223 --> 06:33.101
He says that if he hadn't married Mom,
he would've been

06:33.477 --> 06:34.436
a soccer champion...

06:41.735 --> 06:43.445
a swimming champion...

06:44.696 --> 06:46.448
Gentleman, on your marks,

06:46.698 --> 06:47.407
get set...

06:52.871 --> 06:53.580
And even...

06:54.039 --> 06:54.915
A cycling champion.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.044
World champion
of mythomania is more like it.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.504
That's Mr. Bledurt.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.131
Who asked you, Mister Busybody?

07:03.298 --> 07:04.466
Go eavesdrop elsewhere.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.803
The whole neighborhood
can hear you, loudmouth.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.721
Watch it...
-What?

07:09.930 --> 07:10.597
You don't scare me.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.641
He and Dad tease each other.

07:12.850 --> 07:13.851
Don't touch me, Ok?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.228
What kind of sport is mythomania?

07:16.687 --> 07:17.563
Go home!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.234
And then there's Mom...

07:22.401 --> 07:23.735
Mom! Mom!

07:26.947 --> 07:29.992
One thing's for sure,
Mom always wanted to be a mom.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.619
And I wouldn't want her

07:32.870 --> 07:33.745
to be anything else.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.330
You scared me.

07:38.167 --> 07:41.753
I know why I don't know
what I want to be when I grow up.

07:42.546 --> 07:46.800
It's because my life is swell
and I don't ever want it to change.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.285
Nicholas

08:17.080 --> 08:18.832
Based on the books
_by Goscinny & Sempe

10:35.385 --> 10:38.305
Who knows the story
of Little Tom Thumb?

10:38.889 --> 10:39.389
Eudes?

10:39.890 --> 10:40.933
He's little?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.059
Yes. What else?

10:44.061 --> 10:44.686
Rufus?

10:44.853 --> 10:47.689
He's little, so he steals things
and runs away.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.318
Not exactly.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.445
Alceste?

10:55.781 --> 10:58.283
He refuses to eat well,
so he's all skinny.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.327
Not quite.

11:06.124 --> 11:06.750
Nicholas?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.757
O k, go ahead, Agnan.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.636
Little Tom Thumb
was called Tom Thumb because

11:17.845 --> 11:19.054
he was as little as a thumb.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.140
He was the youngest child
of a poor family

11:22.349 --> 11:25.519
who had no food for their children,
so the parents decided

11:25.936 --> 11:27.312
to abandon them in the forest.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.106
Luckily, Little...

11:46.623 --> 11:48.041
Congratulations, Joachim.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.229
Pass the word:
Joachim has a little brother.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.023
Silence!

12:18.197 --> 12:19.448
Clotaire,
what are you doing?

12:25.329 --> 12:26.830
Come on, tell us!

12:27.581 --> 12:30.792
I was fast asleep.
Dad came in and woke me up.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.171
He was dressed and unshaved,
and he started to laugh.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.341
He said I'd had a little brother.

12:37.841 --> 12:38.467
And then?

12:38.926 --> 12:41.220
He took me to see my mother.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.473
She was at the hospital,
but she looked as happy as Dad.

12:45.015 --> 12:45.766
And next to her,

12:47.351 --> 12:48.519
was my little brother.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.813
You sure don't look happy.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.398
Why would I be?

12:53.607 --> 12:56.443
He's always screaming,
but if I raise my voice

12:56.610 --> 12:59.988
they tell me to hush and Dad says
I'm giving him a headache.

13:00.155 --> 13:02.407
If I get anywhere near the cradle,

13:02.991 --> 13:04.451
they tell me to scram.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.119
How big is a baby?

13:06.537 --> 13:07.496
About this high.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.373
Then put your toys that high.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.084
They'll make you
share your room with him.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.169
No way, it's my room!
It's mine!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.712
Put him in the garden.

13:15.879 --> 13:16.922
We don't have a garden.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.590
Then build one.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.051
How about the garage?
Our dog sleeps there.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.763
I wanted a bicycle, not a brother.

13:24.930 --> 13:28.517
He'll steal your candy
and you won't be able to complain.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.435
'Cause if you complain,

13:30.602 --> 13:33.188
they say you're jealous and punish you.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.232
Maybe you'll end up in the garage.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.820
You're in trouble.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.659
You didn't have any idea?

13:45.784 --> 13:49.746
No. But it's true,
Dad was acting strange lately.

13:49.913 --> 13:50.914
Like what?

13:51.123 --> 13:54.209
Well, like he was real nice
to my mother.

13:54.877 --> 13:58.463
For example,
he'd carry the groceries home.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.592
He'd say, "Darling,
I don't want you getting tired."

14:02.426 --> 14:06.555
One day, he even took the trash out
without moaning. That's unusual.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.854
Mom?
-Yes, sweetheart?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.689
How do you make babies?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.111
Oh look, your father's home!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.571
Surprise!

14:31.371 --> 14:35.751
"For Nicholas, whose father
works so hard. Roger Moucheboume."

14:36.752 --> 14:38.170
Mr. Moucheboume is Dad's boss.

14:38.337 --> 14:41.089
Did you get the note
I left with your secretary?

14:41.256 --> 14:44.092
What note?
-About my raise and promotion...

14:44.259 --> 14:45.469
We'd talked about it.

14:45.636 --> 14:49.348
We'll see about that later.
I have a little favor to ask you...

14:49.681 --> 14:51.808
Mom and Dad argue a lot about him.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.894
He's taking advantage of you.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.438
Fine, then I'll just walk out.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.857
Nicholas, pack up,
we're moving to a trailer.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.610
Swell, I'll get my suitcase.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.447
I have to admit,
Mom and Dad argue a lot.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.909
Why didn't you have it delivered?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.245
It cost more.
Look, where does it go?

15:11.453 --> 15:13.455
But I thought you got a raise.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.625
I haven't got a raise yet.
O n the little table?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.794
I thought...
-Look, it's not sure.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.546
O n the table or the dresser?

15:20.796 --> 15:22.631
Then we shouldn't have bought a TV.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.925
We're still making car payments.

15:25.175 --> 15:28.053
Should I return it or set it down?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.138
Don't hurry me!

15:30.305 --> 15:31.390
I hate being hurried.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.934
But things always work out.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.561
Ok, put it there.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.531
Well, usually.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.162
Nicholas?

15:53.370 --> 15:54.413
Yes?

15:54.788 --> 15:56.874
Never get married.
-Ok.

16:01.211 --> 16:05.382
Nicholas, I think you should write
Mr. Moucheboume a thank you note.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.303
"Dear Sir..."
No, "Dear Mr. Moucheboume..."

16:09.511 --> 16:11.096
No, that's too familiar.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.098
"My dear Mr. Moucheboume..."

16:13.599 --> 16:14.224
Hang on... Honey!

16:15.058 --> 16:17.686
"Dear Sir", "Dear Mr. Moucheboume"
or "My dear Mr. Moucheboume"?

16:17.769 --> 16:20.189
Don't shout! I'm in the kitchen.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.316
"Dear Sir"
or "Dear Mr. Moucheboume"...

16:24.651 --> 16:26.612
"Dear Mr. Moucheboume".
-lsn't that too familiar?

16:26.778 --> 16:29.865
Isn't "Dear Sir" better?
-Then why ask?

16:31.825 --> 16:35.621
Ok, write:
"Dear Sir", comma, new line,

16:36.121 --> 16:39.666
"lt was with surprise
that I had the great surpr..." No.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.961
"lt was with joy..."
No. "lt was with pleasure...

16:43.170 --> 16:46.298
"that I had the great surprise..."
No. "The immense surprise..."

16:46.507 --> 16:49.176
Why not "colossal surprise"
while you're at it?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.221
"The great surprise...

16:52.387 --> 16:55.140
"of receiving your lovely gift..."
No. "Your..."

16:55.516 --> 16:57.976
"Terrific gift"?
-No, "your marvelous gift".

16:58.477 --> 17:00.687
He's right,
"terrific" is more natural.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.981
Can we write this letter in peace?

17:04.816 --> 17:07.444
"Your lovely gift", period.
New paragraph.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.156
"My respects..." No.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.367
"Respectfully yours..."

17:13.450 --> 17:14.535
Hang on...

17:15.035 --> 17:17.663
"Respectfully yours"
or "My sincere respects"?

17:22.376 --> 17:25.587
Put: "My sincere respects".

17:25.921 --> 17:27.005
Then you sign it.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.190
Nicholas, please.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.781
Nicholas...

17:58.871 --> 18:01.165
Stop it with that god-awful toy!

18:24.062 --> 18:25.981
I'll never get that promotion.

18:30.194 --> 18:32.863
What if we invited
the Moucheboumes for dinner?

18:33.989 --> 18:36.617
Maybe your boss
would see you differently.

18:53.050 --> 18:56.303
"One day, he even took the trash out
without moaning.

18:58.222 --> 18:59.765
"That's unusual..."

19:35.801 --> 19:37.636
Honey, I'll get it.
-Thank you, darling.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.555
That's sweet of you.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.893
Which cups should I take?
-Don't worry, I'll get them.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.395
No, I insist.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.439
You'll never find them, love,
I'll do it.

19:57.948 --> 19:59.283
I'm going to have a brother!
-When?

19:59.491 --> 20:02.286
I don't know.
But it's just like Joachim said.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.039
Where is Joachim anyhow?

20:07.833 --> 20:09.251
Children!

20:12.963 --> 20:15.465
Stand in line and follow me.

20:15.716 --> 20:18.594
Today you're going to have
a medical examination.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.973
Miss! Joachim isn't here.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.516
Yes, I know.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.269
Come on now, follow me.
No talking!

20:29.104 --> 20:31.148
What happened to Joachim?

20:31.315 --> 20:33.066
It must be his little brother.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.235
Maybe his parents abandoned him

20:35.402 --> 20:37.529
in the woods like Tom Thumb.

20:43.744 --> 20:44.870
Does it hurt?

20:45.162 --> 20:46.079
You better believe it.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.373
They had to strap us down.

20:50.501 --> 20:52.628
I don't want to go!
I want my mommy!

20:53.045 --> 20:55.756
Agnan, what's wrong with you?
Calm down.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.549
I won't see the doctor!

20:57.799 --> 21:00.219
If you see go the doctor
like a good boy,

21:01.094 --> 21:02.554
I'll test you in math.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.682
On fractions?

21:06.934 --> 21:08.602
Yes.
-O k.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.233
Ok, children. Let's go.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.585
I'll show you some images.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.839
And you'll tell me what you see.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.257
Are you ready?

21:39.466 --> 21:40.926
What do you see?

21:42.010 --> 21:43.971
My father's car.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.100
My father's boat.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.355
My father's airplane.

21:53.564 --> 21:54.940
Cough.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.358
Very good.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.278
Cough.

21:59.570 --> 22:00.529
All right.

22:02.239 --> 22:02.656
Cough...

22:08.120 --> 22:09.746
I'm listening.

22:10.831 --> 22:12.708
I don't know. I didn't study.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.752
Just tell me
what runs through your head.

22:17.129 --> 22:18.213
Should I say a date?

22:19.590 --> 22:22.342
A date? You see a date?

22:22.718 --> 22:24.428
I don't know.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.431
"A date."

22:28.599 --> 22:29.683
And here?

22:31.435 --> 22:32.644
It's not me.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.897
It's not you...

22:35.063 --> 22:35.856
Ok.

22:39.818 --> 22:40.819
And this?

22:43.238 --> 22:44.114
What's wrong?

22:44.323 --> 22:48.160
It's not fair. It's not me
who made all those spots.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.328
Next.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.288
Take your glasses off.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.002
Take them off, I said.

23:00.088 --> 23:03.509
Is this related to your father too?

23:03.717 --> 23:04.968
No. It's my mother's coat.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.388
Which my father bought.

23:10.015 --> 23:10.432
Next.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.603
Without the sandwich,
it'll tip the scales.

23:19.483 --> 23:21.026
It's a little boy,

23:21.485 --> 23:24.571
who finds a seed and plants it.

23:25.656 --> 23:27.783
And the seed grows

23:28.116 --> 23:31.161
into a little baby that starts to grow

23:31.912 --> 23:33.038
and grow and grow...

23:33.455 --> 23:36.375
Until it's a big giant
who catches the little boy

23:36.708 --> 23:38.752
and eats him alive.

23:47.761 --> 23:50.097
I simply walked up to him and said,

23:50.305 --> 23:53.267
"Why don't you and your wife
come for dinner one night?"

23:53.684 --> 23:56.144
What did he say?
-"Excellent idea."

23:56.270 --> 23:59.314
"I'll tell my wife."
-I'm so happy!

24:00.190 --> 24:03.443
Tell me, what type of woman
is Mrs. Moucheboume?

24:04.278 --> 24:06.238
No idea. I never met her.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.949
I mean,
is she the sophisticated type or...

24:09.408 --> 24:10.576
I said, I don't know.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.830
Don't worry, there's no problem.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.082
But I am getting worried.

24:18.167 --> 24:20.127
Everything has to be perfect.

24:20.294 --> 24:23.547
What about Nicholas?
What'll we do with him?

24:24.506 --> 24:27.634
Will he stay with us?
-No, it's out of the question.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.304
He can't sit still.
-Oh my God...

24:30.304 --> 24:31.388
I'm afraid already.

24:39.688 --> 24:40.189
Here.

24:45.068 --> 24:46.111
Nicholas...

24:47.154 --> 24:48.155
You're not eating?

24:49.615 --> 24:51.533
You need to keep your strength up.

24:53.243 --> 24:56.371
How about a walk in the woods
next weekend?

25:08.175 --> 25:10.427
Be like Agnan, start kissing up.

25:10.928 --> 25:12.804
Yeah, buy your mother a present.

25:13.180 --> 25:16.099
Like some salami,
or a nice baked ham.

25:16.225 --> 25:19.603
That way, she won't have the heart
to abandon you.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.397
No! You should buy her a ring.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.816
That's what my father does.
It always works.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.861
But I only have three francs.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.076
Hello.

25:34.243 --> 25:37.204
Can I help you?
-I'd like some flowers for my mom.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.414
How sweet, she's lucky.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.625
It's so she won't abandon him.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.505
How much are roses?
-Three francs.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.382
Great! I'll take them.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.847
No. Three francs for one rose.

25:56.181 --> 25:59.059
Can you lend me some money?
I'll pay you back.

25:59.434 --> 26:01.186
I just have enough for a snack.

26:02.062 --> 26:03.230
And you?
-I'm broke.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.525
Sure. You just don't want to.
-It's my money.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.485
Stingy rat.
-Stingy yourself.

26:08.694 --> 26:10.904
You're lucky I'm holding the flowers.

26:11.405 --> 26:12.865
Calm down.
-I'll hold them for you.

26:14.867 --> 26:15.993
Don't touch me or...

26:22.166 --> 26:23.167
Murderer!

27:12.132 --> 27:14.551
Your flower is very pretty, sweetheart.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.472
Clotaire was right,

27:18.639 --> 27:20.432
the Agnan technique worked.

27:20.599 --> 27:23.644
I did everything I could
to make Mom happy.

27:24.520 --> 27:27.564
I even agreed to wear my blue suit,

27:27.856 --> 27:29.733
the one I look like a nitwit in,

27:29.942 --> 27:32.236
and go to Mrs. Courteplaque's.

27:32.736 --> 27:33.987
Look how cute he is.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.865
He's the one
who insisted on coming.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.326
Let me give you a kiss.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.579
Marie-Edwige, there you are.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.546
That's Marie-Edwige.

27:51.588 --> 27:54.466
She's very pretty
but she's just a girl.

27:58.846 --> 28:01.014
Take Nicholas to your room to play.

28:03.392 --> 28:05.310
What shall we play?

28:07.229 --> 28:08.480
We could play nurse.

28:08.856 --> 28:11.859
We'll pretend it's wartime.
You can be wounded

28:12.150 --> 28:14.945
and I'll heal you
and save you despite the danger.

28:16.530 --> 28:18.657
I'd rather play cards.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.118
Ok. What can you play?

28:22.619 --> 28:23.787
I can play "War".

28:24.079 --> 28:25.956
I know a much better game.

28:27.082 --> 28:30.043
Marie-Edwige's game
had very complicated rules.

28:30.169 --> 28:32.504
For example,
she could look at my hand

28:32.713 --> 28:34.464
and exchange certain cards.

28:35.966 --> 28:36.800
But not me.

28:40.971 --> 28:44.057
And the cards didn't have
the same value as usual.

28:45.225 --> 28:48.187
She could take my king
with her three.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.230
But...
-What?

28:50.772 --> 28:52.232
There were penalties too.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.484
Come on, giddy-up, horsey!

28:54.693 --> 28:56.361
And I always lost.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.698
It's sticky.
-Don't move!

29:02.993 --> 29:06.079
Later on, Marie-Edwige's girlfriends
came over.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.123
Hello!

29:10.292 --> 29:13.170
Then the fun really started.

29:23.388 --> 29:24.264
But at one point...

29:27.809 --> 29:31.563
I thought I might have
to change schools.

29:34.191 --> 29:35.901
Goodbye, Nicholas.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.153
Bye, Nicholas.

29:39.029 --> 29:40.531
See you soon, Nicholas.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.449
Goodbye, Nicholas.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.703
Well, bye.

29:47.538 --> 29:50.749
Goodbye, Marie-Edwige,
I had a swell time with you,

29:50.958 --> 29:53.961
you're very pretty
and I hope to see you again soon.

29:54.586 --> 29:57.464
Actually,
I think it was more like...

30:06.139 --> 30:07.599
I'm so proud of you.

30:07.933 --> 30:09.560
Mom was very pleased.

30:11.728 --> 30:13.397
But it still wasn't enough.

30:13.605 --> 30:16.567
Tomorrow,
we'll go for a walk in the woods.

30:58.275 --> 31:01.653
Nicholas. What are you doing?
Open the door.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.823
Come on, open the door.

31:05.449 --> 31:06.450
Open the door!

31:07.743 --> 31:09.995
Very funny. Come on, open it.

31:11.788 --> 31:15.167
Open this car door at once!
I don't believe it.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.044
Open it, for God's sake!

31:17.211 --> 31:19.421
Stop shouting, you'll scare him.

31:19.630 --> 31:22.174
Nicholas, it's me, your mother.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.259
Open the door.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.845
Come on, son, stop being silly.

31:27.262 --> 31:29.681
How are we going to get home?

31:56.416 --> 32:00.546
Mom and Dad spent the rest
of the afternoon arguing.

32:04.383 --> 32:07.886
I could tell that Mom
didn't want to abandon me,

32:08.595 --> 32:11.723
but I knew
Dad would persuade her in the end.

32:15.686 --> 32:16.562
I know what we'll do.

32:16.770 --> 32:19.022
We'll form a secret gang
to help Nicholas.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.984
What's a secret gang?
-A group of heroes.

32:22.192 --> 32:24.862
We can call our gang "The Unbeatables".

32:26.155 --> 32:29.199
We'll meet at the vacant lot.
-We need a password.

32:29.992 --> 32:32.035
"lnvincible courage"!
-Yeah!

32:32.452 --> 32:35.455
And only those who know it
can come in.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.709
Children, get in line!

32:46.675 --> 32:48.927
It's a note from my parents.

32:52.097 --> 32:55.142
Pleeze excuze our sun
hoo didn't doo his homework.

32:56.602 --> 32:57.477
Who wrote this?

33:00.189 --> 33:00.731
Daddy.

33:15.871 --> 33:16.997
Teacher?
-Yes?

33:17.164 --> 33:20.375
Can we come closer to see?
-Of course.

33:21.418 --> 33:22.419
Sit down!

33:25.380 --> 33:26.673
Stand up.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.300
Sit down.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.385
Children,

33:30.761 --> 33:35.641
I'm very pleased to announce that
the Minister of Education himself

33:35.849 --> 33:38.852
shall honor us
with a visit to our school.

33:39.061 --> 33:42.898
I'm counting on you
to make his visit unforgettable.

33:43.106 --> 33:45.067
I turn to your teacher

33:45.359 --> 33:48.779
and ask her to organize
a performance...

33:49.196 --> 33:53.450
which I'm sure will combine
culture and pedagogy.

33:53.659 --> 33:57.496
It will make a marvelous impression
on our guest.

33:57.913 --> 34:01.083
Our teacher didn't like
the idea of a performance.

34:01.542 --> 34:06.046
I have to admit, she'd already tried
to put on a play...

34:06.421 --> 34:07.548
Come on! The zebras!

34:08.215 --> 34:11.134
Go on. The zebra first,
then the crocodile.

34:11.342 --> 34:12.177
There, that's it.

34:12.386 --> 34:13.469
Geoffroy!

34:14.346 --> 34:16.931
What on earth is that costume?

34:17.391 --> 34:18.433
Geoffroy...

34:18.641 --> 34:19.935
A parade...

34:20.936 --> 34:22.563
One, two! One, two!

34:22.938 --> 34:24.565
Half turn... to the right!

34:26.233 --> 34:27.693
What's this?

34:27.818 --> 34:30.112
Lines of two!
What kind of troop is this?

34:32.114 --> 34:33.282
Lines of two, I said!

34:34.241 --> 34:36.493
You're the shame of France.

34:36.702 --> 34:38.620
You heard me,
the shame of France!

34:38.829 --> 34:40.664
And even a choir...

34:45.502 --> 34:47.545
But it never worked out.

34:49.089 --> 34:51.007
Sorry, these kids are hopeless.

34:52.801 --> 34:54.844
You see, it's just that...

34:54.928 --> 34:57.598
It might make us run late
with our program.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.185
Well then, have them recite a poem.

35:01.351 --> 35:04.229
They've studied poetry,
haven't they?

35:04.813 --> 35:06.148
Yes.

35:06.565 --> 35:09.026
"The Crow and the Fox".
-Wonderful.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.028
Let's see...

35:11.862 --> 35:16.116
You, my boy, please recite:
"The Crow and the Fox".

35:16.867 --> 35:17.951
I don't know it all

35:18.160 --> 35:21.205
but it's about a crow
with Roquefort cheese in its beak.

35:21.580 --> 35:22.456
It was Camembert!

35:22.623 --> 35:26.251
It couldn't be,
Camembert is runny and it stinks!

35:28.212 --> 35:30.255
"Master Crow, perched on a tree..."

35:30.506 --> 35:32.633
That's enough!

35:32.883 --> 35:35.552
Calm down!

35:38.096 --> 35:40.057
Back to your drawings.

35:48.273 --> 35:49.274
No.

36:00.744 --> 36:02.704
Password.
-"lnvincible courage".

36:05.249 --> 36:07.376
Password.
-"lnvincible courage".

36:10.045 --> 36:11.505
"lnvincible courage".

36:13.090 --> 36:14.424
"lnvincible courage".

36:18.554 --> 36:19.304
Password.

36:20.514 --> 36:23.016
"Terrible courage"?
-Password, or I can't let you in.

36:23.684 --> 36:24.643
"Funny courage"?

36:26.979 --> 36:28.814
"Terrific courage"?

36:29.022 --> 36:31.066
First of all, we need a leader.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.193
I suggest it be me.
-Why you?

36:33.443 --> 36:35.571
I've got the nicest clothes.

36:35.988 --> 36:37.281
The leader's the strongest!

36:37.489 --> 36:39.408
The leader's the oldest!
That's me.

36:39.616 --> 36:42.327
No, Clotaire is oldest,
he flunked nursery school.

36:42.578 --> 36:46.456
If it's only to argue,
we could've stayed at school.

36:50.043 --> 36:52.254
Hello?
One moment, I'll see.

36:52.671 --> 36:53.714
Sir?

36:53.881 --> 36:56.008
Yes?
-It's the ministry.

36:56.341 --> 36:59.511
The Legion of Honor ceremony.
-What a bore.

36:59.970 --> 37:02.055
Here. Find a date for them
next month.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.473
Yes, sir.

37:04.725 --> 37:07.311
"l have not yet received..."
-Your shirts, sir.

37:07.728 --> 37:08.770
Thank you, old boy.

37:10.439 --> 37:11.940
I shined your shoes too.

37:13.650 --> 37:15.068
Where were we, hon?

37:15.277 --> 37:18.322
"l have not yet received
an answer to last month's..."

37:20.908 --> 37:21.909
Did you hear me?

37:23.827 --> 37:25.579
I said I've changed my mind.

37:26.079 --> 37:28.123
I don't want
to have the Moucheboumes over.

37:28.207 --> 37:29.583
What? Why not?
-Because.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.252
I don't have a dress or jewelry,

37:32.377 --> 37:34.379
and I don't know how
to drive a car.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.093
Darling, what's got into you?

37:40.469 --> 37:44.139
I don't want to look like a dimwit
in front of Mrs. Moucheboume.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.355
A dimwit? What do you mean?

37:51.605 --> 37:54.358
Does her husband
drive her to the hairdresser?

37:54.525 --> 37:55.359
No.

37:55.526 --> 37:57.277
Does she take the bus? No.

37:57.402 --> 37:59.571
So she drives and I don't.
-Makes sense.

38:01.490 --> 38:04.117
Is her only fancy dress
her engagement dress?

38:04.618 --> 38:06.495
No. Me, yes.

38:06.703 --> 38:10.040
What about the green dress
you bought for Aunt Pelagia's 60th?

38:10.290 --> 38:13.585
I wear it all the time.
-No, you don't.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.088
Often enough, I'd say.

38:16.505 --> 38:19.883
Is her only topic of conversation
her family and home? No.

38:20.342 --> 38:22.344
She's modern...
-A woman of her time.

38:22.469 --> 38:23.929
Brilliant and independent...

38:24.304 --> 38:27.391
I'm just a middleclass housewife
who does the cooking.

38:27.599 --> 38:29.977
I refuse to be humiliated all evening.

38:30.727 --> 38:32.771
I'd rather call it off.

38:34.857 --> 38:36.066
Very well.

38:37.151 --> 38:40.028
My wife will be humiliated
in front of no one.

38:40.279 --> 38:42.364
Tomorrow,
we'll buy you a new dress.

38:43.323 --> 38:45.450
And some jewelry?
-And jewelry.

38:46.160 --> 38:46.952
I can learn to drive?

38:49.496 --> 38:51.540
That too.
-Oh, sweetheart!

38:53.917 --> 38:55.752
How much would a wall cost?

38:59.464 --> 39:01.216
"Courage..."

39:01.967 --> 39:02.676
"ln..."

39:03.969 --> 39:05.762
"lnvi..."
-"lnvisible"!

39:07.681 --> 39:10.475
Ok, everyone will be the leader
of his own gang,

39:10.684 --> 39:13.687
which includes members
of the full gang. For example,

39:13.896 --> 39:16.899
Geoffroy will be the leader
of his gang, which includes

39:17.191 --> 39:19.151
himself, Rufus, Alceste and me.

39:19.485 --> 39:21.361
Rufus is the leader of his gang,

39:21.820 --> 39:23.530
with Eudes, Clotaire and me.

39:23.697 --> 39:27.826
Eudes is the leader of his gang,
with Geoffroy, Rufus, Alceste and me.

39:28.076 --> 39:30.370
And my gang includes all of you.

39:30.621 --> 39:31.705
Do we agree?

39:32.247 --> 39:33.707
Do we agree?

39:33.874 --> 39:34.917
Yes.

39:35.167 --> 39:36.752
So, now what do we do?

39:40.130 --> 39:42.549
I know! We'll clean your house.

39:42.925 --> 39:44.635
We'll all come over and tidy up.

39:45.010 --> 39:48.472
Your parents will be so happy
they'll have to keep you.

39:48.889 --> 39:51.141
Be good, I'm counting on you.

39:51.350 --> 39:53.894
We'll be home in two hours.
Less if Mom's gifted.

39:54.102 --> 39:55.354
What's that mean?
-What?

39:55.562 --> 39:57.564
"Less if Mom's gifted."
-I don't know.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.608
Two hours, one hour, whatever.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.985
You're insinuating something.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.946
Don't start up, Ok?
-You started.

40:04.196 --> 40:06.865
You assume I'm going to fail.
-No, I don't.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.867
Yes, you do. I'm sorry, you do.

40:12.287 --> 40:13.580
We have two hours.

41:30.282 --> 41:32.534
Straighten up.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.829
Straighten up, straighten up, I said!

41:36.038 --> 41:39.166
You're flustering me
with your "straighten ups".

41:43.837 --> 41:45.047
Straighten up!

41:55.432 --> 41:58.143
Admit it. You were heading
straight off the road.

42:04.942 --> 42:09.029
I was awfully impatient
for Mom and Dad to see

42:09.196 --> 42:11.698
how my friends and l
had cleaned the house.

42:13.367 --> 42:15.744
Ok, I'll pay for driving lessons.

42:41.311 --> 42:44.773
I realized I'd never be able
to make them happy.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.986
So I decided to run away from home.

42:51.405 --> 42:54.491
I packed up everything
I thought I might need,

42:55.576 --> 42:57.119
and I left.

43:01.331 --> 43:05.294
I wanted to go a long way away,
like to China or Arcachon.

43:07.671 --> 43:10.841
Mom and Dad would be very sorry
and they'd miss me.

43:11.008 --> 43:12.926
But I'd only come back after years,

43:13.093 --> 43:15.345
when I was captain of a warship

43:15.679 --> 43:18.015
and I earned lots of money.

43:18.891 --> 43:22.019
I'd take them to the movies
and people would say:

43:22.227 --> 43:24.146
"Look, Nicholas has lots of money.

43:24.354 --> 43:27.232
"He takes his Mom and Dad
to the movies,

43:27.483 --> 43:30.486
"even if they were mean to him."

43:49.254 --> 43:52.466
You chickened out.
-I thought it over. Not the same!

43:53.383 --> 43:54.927
It's not up to me to leave.

43:55.385 --> 43:58.055
I was there first.
The one who should leave

43:58.597 --> 44:01.016
is the baby!
So when it gets here...

44:02.809 --> 44:04.728
we'll get rid of it.

44:07.105 --> 44:09.441
How?
-We could sell it to the SPCA.

44:09.608 --> 44:11.985
They only take animals, you idiot!

44:12.194 --> 44:15.155
We'll abandon it
in the jungle to wolves.

44:15.531 --> 44:17.616
Albert read me a story like that.

44:17.825 --> 44:19.409
No, the jungle is too far.

44:19.618 --> 44:22.621
We'll hide it in a hut
and raise it in secret.

44:22.830 --> 44:24.039
We'll take turns feeding it.

44:24.456 --> 44:27.751
I can only go out on Thursdays.

44:27.918 --> 44:29.294
Me too.

44:29.670 --> 44:32.256
Me too, except if I'm punished.
Which is often.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.091
We can leave food for it.

44:34.925 --> 44:36.593
My aunt does that with her cat.

44:36.969 --> 44:40.597
No way! Babies aren't like cats,
they can't feed themselves.

44:42.808 --> 44:44.226
I heard everything.

44:45.727 --> 44:47.354
What did you hear, you dirty rat?

44:47.604 --> 44:50.899
You want to take Nicholas' baby
and hide it in the jungle

44:51.066 --> 44:54.194
and feed it cat food.
I'll tell the teacher

44:54.611 --> 44:57.406
and the Principal,
and you'll be in big trouble.

44:57.990 --> 44:58.949
Unless...

44:59.199 --> 45:00.325
Unless what?

45:01.076 --> 45:04.371
You let me propose my idea
for the performance.

45:04.621 --> 45:05.706
What's your idea?

45:28.562 --> 45:31.231
Listen, we can't get rid
of the baby ourselves.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.026
The police will find out
and we'll be in trouble.

45:34.401 --> 45:37.029
The only solution
is to have it kidnapped

45:37.196 --> 45:37.988
by a gangster.

45:38.780 --> 45:41.825
A gangster?
Where will we find a gangster?

46:04.056 --> 46:05.849
Sir!

46:06.058 --> 46:07.851
Come here!

46:08.310 --> 46:10.062
Come on, sir!

46:12.147 --> 46:14.024
Come here. Yes, you!

46:14.274 --> 46:15.359
Come here!

46:26.453 --> 46:28.705
It flows into the sea,

46:29.164 --> 46:31.083
forming a delta
called the Camargue.

46:31.291 --> 46:32.417
Thank you, Agnan.

46:33.377 --> 46:35.546
What river flows through Paris?

46:39.758 --> 46:40.676
Clotaire.

46:43.345 --> 46:44.847
Did you hear the question?

46:45.180 --> 46:47.432
"What river flows through Paris?"-Yes.

46:47.724 --> 46:49.101
What's its name?

46:53.730 --> 46:55.899
Come now, Clotaire.
-It's...

47:14.293 --> 47:16.670
Clotaire.
-Yes, miss.

47:17.045 --> 47:20.340
Didn't your parents
take you on a riverboat ride?

47:20.799 --> 47:23.468
What river did the boat sail on?
-The Seine.

47:26.471 --> 47:28.307
Go on now.

47:34.354 --> 47:36.648
"Based on alliteration,
syllable counts,

47:37.399 --> 47:39.651
"or accents, Skaldic poetry,

47:39.818 --> 47:41.778
"developed by lcelander
Snorri Sturf..."

47:45.949 --> 47:46.950
I can't say that one.

47:47.242 --> 47:49.453
Then don't say it.
-No funny comments.

47:51.330 --> 47:52.414
Snorri Sturluson...

47:52.664 --> 47:55.083
"Developed
by lcelander Snorri Sturluson

47:55.250 --> 47:59.338
"is essentially a question of style
where literal meaning

47:59.588 --> 48:01.757
"is replaced by periphrases
and metaphors."

48:01.924 --> 48:03.509
Another one. On music.

48:05.052 --> 48:07.971
I doubt Mrs. Moucheboume
will want to discuss music

48:08.138 --> 48:10.974
after your talk on 13th century
Scandinavian poetry.

48:11.141 --> 48:15.312
I think she'll be delighted
to discover a cultivated person

48:15.521 --> 48:18.607
who can hold a conversation
while the men talk business.

48:19.441 --> 48:20.484
Go on.

48:21.401 --> 48:22.319
"Baroque style."

48:22.528 --> 48:26.532
"From the Portuguese word barroco
meaning misshapen pearls..."

48:28.992 --> 48:30.577
Hey guys!

48:32.621 --> 48:33.330
Look!

48:35.666 --> 48:36.917
Blind Jack!

48:37.167 --> 48:38.836
BLIND JACK ON THE RUN!

48:39.044 --> 48:40.128
That's who we need.

48:41.255 --> 48:43.799
Are you finished!
Jailbirds!

48:44.174 --> 48:46.218
Cossacks!
Everyone get in line.

48:48.387 --> 48:49.012
Move it.

48:53.433 --> 48:55.143
Boys,

48:56.687 --> 48:59.022
your teacher will be away
for a few days.

48:59.356 --> 49:02.776
A substitute teacher, Miss Navarrin,
will replace her.

49:03.152 --> 49:04.486
Here she is.

49:15.873 --> 49:18.167
Geography. The rivers of France.

49:31.597 --> 49:32.389
Sit down.

49:33.724 --> 49:34.850
Silence!

49:38.645 --> 49:39.646
Very well.

49:40.397 --> 49:44.234
I see that today's lesson
was to be on rivers.

49:45.152 --> 49:46.570
I'll start by testing

49:46.820 --> 49:49.323
your level of knowledge
on the subject.

49:53.035 --> 49:55.954
But first,
we must hang the map up.

49:56.455 --> 49:58.040
Who'd like to do that?

49:58.207 --> 49:58.707
Sit down!

50:00.584 --> 50:03.670
I'll decide who hangs the map.

50:06.131 --> 50:07.591
You, back there.

50:08.759 --> 50:09.718
What's your name?

50:12.137 --> 50:13.180
Clotaire, miss.

50:14.348 --> 50:16.558
You seem less unruly
than the others.

50:17.518 --> 50:18.393
Hang the map up.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.689
But, miss...

50:23.065 --> 50:25.442
Silence!

50:31.657 --> 50:33.450
I see we have a little rebel.

50:34.576 --> 50:37.246
Let me tell you,
I show little rebels who's boss.

50:38.038 --> 50:39.498
Is that clear?

50:45.796 --> 50:48.423
You, recite your lesson
on the Seine River.

50:49.466 --> 50:51.593
The source of the Seine
is in Burgundy,

50:51.844 --> 50:54.972
it's 776 km long
and flows into the English Channel.

50:55.639 --> 50:57.474
Very good. And you?

50:58.559 --> 51:01.228
Its tributaries are
the Aube, Marne, Oise and Yonne.

51:02.020 --> 51:03.147
Very good.

51:03.564 --> 51:05.023
Now you, the comedian.

51:06.233 --> 51:08.652
Mister Rattle Mouth,

51:09.027 --> 51:10.612
what else can you tell me?

51:12.698 --> 51:15.742
I see you have
nothing intelligent to say.

51:16.952 --> 51:19.663
To the corner.
That'll teach you to show off.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.084
What are you waiting for?

51:24.626 --> 51:26.670
It's because he's not used to it.

51:27.713 --> 51:29.882
I'll show him how.

51:32.384 --> 51:33.719
Thank you, Hilaire.

51:34.469 --> 51:37.472
"Gambert, Ganguin, Gangsain..."

51:38.265 --> 51:40.684
There's nothing under "Gangster".
-Try "Blind".

51:44.021 --> 51:46.648
"Blind, Jack." I found it!

51:52.404 --> 51:55.157
JACK'S GARAGE

52:00.662 --> 52:02.664
Blind Jack?
-Hang on.

52:02.873 --> 52:04.541
Jack! It's for you!

52:06.543 --> 52:09.630
See if he can take care of
the new teacher too.

52:11.173 --> 52:12.799
Hello?
-Blind Jack?

52:13.050 --> 52:14.092
Yes, that's me.

52:14.301 --> 52:15.302
It's for a removal.

52:15.511 --> 52:17.930
Can't we deal with it
on the spot?

52:18.180 --> 52:19.097
"On the spot?"

52:19.306 --> 52:20.140
Yeah, fix it...

52:20.390 --> 52:21.975
right there, on the spot.

52:22.184 --> 52:24.478
No! We want it taken away,
that's all.

52:24.686 --> 52:26.688
That's all!

52:26.980 --> 52:28.982
I'll have to get my hands in it.

52:29.608 --> 52:32.027
"ln it"?
-Yeah, strip the body down.

52:33.570 --> 52:34.863
If I have to come get it...

52:35.072 --> 52:37.074
it's 500 francs minimum.

52:37.783 --> 52:39.117
We'll call you back.

52:39.868 --> 52:42.162
What did he say?
-Tell us!

52:43.455 --> 52:45.040
What did he say?

52:45.207 --> 52:47.543
He wants 500 francs to strip the body.

52:48.377 --> 52:51.213
I knew it,
gangsters are all crooks.

52:51.588 --> 52:54.049
What about the new teacher?

53:01.056 --> 53:02.933
O h my, these chocolates are old.

53:04.059 --> 53:07.020
Don't touch this, honey,
it's like poison.

53:13.026 --> 53:15.195
TEACHERS' ROOM

53:18.657 --> 53:21.160
Yes.
-It's a present for you.

53:25.080 --> 53:26.623
How sweet.

53:28.041 --> 53:29.126
Thank you.

53:29.543 --> 53:32.629
A maid?
-Yes, a maid for the dinner.

53:32.963 --> 53:36.341
I can't leave poor Mrs. Moucheboume
by herself while I cook.

53:36.550 --> 53:39.094
It's more elegant, don't you agree?

53:40.596 --> 53:44.725
For the dinner menu, I was thinking
of lobster with mayonnaise.

53:45.184 --> 53:47.478
You know how much that costs?

53:47.686 --> 53:49.605
Eighty francs a kilo.

53:53.150 --> 53:53.859
Listen...

53:54.568 --> 53:56.820
The mayonnaise is a good idea.

53:57.029 --> 54:00.324
But for the rest,
can't we do something simple?

54:00.491 --> 54:02.075
-You know, casual.
"Casual".

54:02.284 --> 54:06.330
I can make ham sandwiches
and we'll eat in front of the TV.

54:11.168 --> 54:13.545
I spent the whole night thinking about

54:13.712 --> 54:17.841
how to find 500 francs
for the kidnapping.

54:18.509 --> 54:20.469
But the next day at school,

54:20.802 --> 54:23.722
Geoffroy showed up with something
I'd never seen before.

54:25.682 --> 54:28.101
How does it work?
-You got any change?

54:29.394 --> 54:32.564
Pick a number
and put your coin on it.

54:33.899 --> 54:36.109
I spin the wheel and throw the ball...

54:41.782 --> 54:42.366
And you lost.

54:44.076 --> 54:45.994
That's how we'll make money.

54:46.203 --> 54:48.288
We'll get adults to play
for big stakes.

54:50.874 --> 54:51.875
What are you up to?

54:52.292 --> 54:55.671
You're playing roulette!
For money on top of it!

54:56.380 --> 55:00.592
Haven't your parents told you
gambling leads to ruin and prison?

55:00.968 --> 55:03.637
Silly fools!
Give that to me.

55:04.137 --> 55:05.848
I'm confiscating this game.

55:06.098 --> 55:08.433
I don't approve of parents
buying such things.

55:09.685 --> 55:11.562
Everyone line up for class.

55:20.028 --> 55:21.405
Boys,

55:21.864 --> 55:23.615
I have more bad news for you.

55:24.741 --> 55:27.786
Your substitute teacher,
Miss Navarrin, has fallen ill.

55:28.162 --> 55:30.205
She won't be at school today.

55:31.206 --> 55:33.834
BOY KILLS SCHOOLTEACHER

55:36.753 --> 55:39.006
The jury finds the defendant guilty!

55:40.340 --> 55:42.593
On top of it, he's a dirty rat.

55:51.810 --> 55:52.978
Agnan, what's wrong?

55:53.645 --> 55:56.064
You can't hit me, I wear glasses.

55:57.858 --> 56:01.487
Like I said, Miss Navarrin
caught a cold and has to stay home.

56:02.154 --> 56:04.198
You'll stay in your classroom
like good boys.

56:04.364 --> 56:09.453
One of your friends will look after you.
Someone I can trust.

56:18.003 --> 56:20.130
We were supposed
to have math today.

56:20.797 --> 56:23.383
O pen your books
and we'll do some problems.

56:23.634 --> 56:24.384
Are you crazy?

56:24.676 --> 56:25.886
Be quiet! I'm in charge!

56:26.094 --> 56:27.513
Who does the rat think he is?

56:28.096 --> 56:29.389
Silence! Eudes, to the corner!

56:29.640 --> 56:30.766
You'll eat your math book.

56:31.975 --> 56:32.851
No, I wear glasses.

56:33.268 --> 56:34.311
You'll eat them too!

56:38.023 --> 56:39.691
-Geoffroy!
What?

56:39.900 --> 56:41.985
-We have to get the roulette.
But how?

57:06.802 --> 57:09.012
DOWN WITH TEAC...

57:09.972 --> 57:11.932
"Down with teachers"?

57:12.099 --> 57:13.559
"Down with teacups".

57:13.725 --> 57:15.561
I'm the Queen of England.

57:15.811 --> 57:17.396
Let's see the Principal.

57:23.735 --> 57:25.571
Rarely in my career,

57:26.196 --> 57:28.532
have I encountered
such blatant provocation.

57:29.575 --> 57:31.368
I'm worried about you, my friend.

57:31.952 --> 57:35.205
What do you suggest,
Old Sp... Mr. Dubon?

57:36.623 --> 57:38.584
I suggest writing 300 times:

57:38.917 --> 57:42.546
"l will not write disgraceful
inscriptions on my school walls,

57:42.754 --> 57:46.175
"for education is devoted
to learning and spiritual elevation

57:46.425 --> 57:48.510
"in accordance with
the values of the Republic."

57:48.719 --> 57:51.597
Up to "school walls" will do.

57:52.890 --> 57:55.684
You won't leave
before handing this in.

57:57.519 --> 57:58.228
You hear me?

58:00.314 --> 58:03.358
This way, ladies and gents.
-One-franc bets!

58:03.484 --> 58:04.776
Try your luck.

58:05.110 --> 58:06.528
One franc, sir.

58:06.737 --> 58:08.822
Come on! You can win!

58:14.536 --> 58:15.537
A game, ma'am?

58:15.746 --> 58:18.916
Why not! If it'll make
you children happy.

58:19.416 --> 58:20.792
How much do I bet?

58:21.001 --> 58:21.835
Ten francs.

58:23.003 --> 58:24.004
Ten francs.

58:24.338 --> 58:25.339
Here you go.

58:26.673 --> 58:28.967
What number should I bet on?

58:29.301 --> 58:31.053
Anything you want.
"4"?

58:31.762 --> 58:33.096
Ok, let's try "4".

58:33.388 --> 58:33.931
There.

58:34.348 --> 58:36.642
Ten on "4", let's roll.

58:42.773 --> 58:43.565
I won!

58:44.274 --> 58:45.108
I won!

59:22.729 --> 59:24.773
That's all you've done in an hour?

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:03.395
Where is she? Where is she?

01:00:11.111 --> 01:00:12.529
Honey, can you tie this?

01:00:12.654 --> 01:00:13.822
I'm a wreck!

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:16.742
I haven't eaten all day,
I was too busy preparing.

01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:18.619
Where is she, darn it?

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:23.916
Calm down.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:27.920
They'll be here any minute
and there's no one to serve dinner.

01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:29.505
There she is!

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.383
Come round the back.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.094
And toss this in the trash
on your way.

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.308
What's that?

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.352
That is lobster with mayonnaise.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.479
But it's not for little boys.

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:48.607
You're getting good old ravioli
and tomato sauce.

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:51.401
I don't want ravioli,
I want lobster.

01:00:51.819 --> 01:00:52.986
Nicholas, that's enough!

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:57.157
Where is the silly goose?

01:01:03.664 --> 01:01:04.790
Good evening, Mr. Moucheboume.

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:06.959
Good evening, madam.

01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:08.085
My wife isn't here?

01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:13.382
I sent her on ahead
while I parked the car.

01:01:19.638 --> 01:01:23.725
Oh, Mrs. Moucheboume,
what a horrible misunderstanding.

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:26.145
I'm so ashamed. Please, this way.

01:01:28.313 --> 01:01:29.523
Right this way.

01:01:38.031 --> 01:01:40.075
Nicholas, go in and say hello.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.295
Good evening, Mr. Moucheboume.

01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:52.796
Hello, Mrs. Moucheboume.

01:01:53.547 --> 01:01:55.382
So this is the little Nicholas.

01:01:55.966 --> 01:01:58.093
Did you like my top?

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:01.138
Yes, but Dad says
it gives him a headache.

01:02:03.223 --> 01:02:05.058
Next time, I'll get something else.

01:02:05.851 --> 01:02:07.978
What would make you happy?

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.355
500 francs would be great.

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:11.607
Watch your manners!

01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:12.649
He's only a child.

01:02:13.442 --> 01:02:16.820
T ell me, what would you do
with 500 francs?

01:02:17.488 --> 01:02:18.822
I have to whisper it.

01:02:19.031 --> 01:02:19.990
Ok, come here.

01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:24.244
I'd hire a gangster
to kidnap my brother

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.121
so my parents will keep me.

01:02:33.545 --> 01:02:36.715
Believe me, Nicholas,
the only way to earn money,

01:02:37.633 --> 01:02:38.550
is hard work.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:39.593
Very hard work.

01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:42.429
You'll thank me later.

01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:44.348
For 500 francs,
I'd thank you now.

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:45.641
Back to the kitchen!

01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:50.270
I'm so sorry.
-He's only a child.

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:52.481
I said hello.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.566
Very good.

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:58.695
There you go. Now it's time to eat.

01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:21.510
Mrs. Moucheboume, do you enjoy
Scandinavian literature?

01:03:23.095 --> 01:03:26.181
I have a soft spot
for 13th century Skaldic poetry.

01:03:26.431 --> 01:03:29.726
The manner it has of using
"polyphrases" and metaphors

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:33.021
instead of literal meaning.

01:03:35.232 --> 01:03:37.151
It's really very interesting.

01:03:39.278 --> 01:03:40.154
Yes, very.

01:03:44.074 --> 01:03:46.034
I just adore Snorsi Struffl...

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.621
Snorki Snuffn...

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.668
Storki Stleft...

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.920
Smurski Stroflt...

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:07.347
Speaking of which,

01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:10.601
did you know that
the word "baroque" was Portuguese?

01:04:11.351 --> 01:04:13.312
Yes, from the town of Barroco...

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:16.940
Very famous for its oysters.
Lully loved them.

01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:20.068
That's where the chocolate
got its name, incidentally.

01:04:21.028 --> 01:04:22.237
Lully...

01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:23.989
The chocolate.

01:04:33.582 --> 01:04:34.541
What if we ate?

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:36.335
Sure.

01:04:38.754 --> 01:04:41.507
It's just a casual little meal.
-Perfect.

01:04:41.757 --> 01:04:45.385
I'm so weary of eating
lobster with mayonnaise

01:04:45.594 --> 01:04:47.137
every time we're invited for dinner.

01:04:50.015 --> 01:04:51.850
One second, please.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:10.035
There you go.

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.206
We could sing in the street.

01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:57.916
Or wash windshields at red lights.

01:05:58.083 --> 01:05:59.626
Or keep the shopping change.

01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:02.546
No. We need to make lots of money fast.

01:06:02.754 --> 01:06:05.883
Hang on, my father told me
how he got rich.

01:06:06.091 --> 01:06:07.092
One day,

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:10.387
he found an apple, picked it up,
and sold it for a franc.

01:06:10.596 --> 01:06:11.346
And then?

01:06:11.972 --> 01:06:14.558
He bought two apples
and sold them for two francs.

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:15.517
And then?

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:18.312
His uncle died and he inherited.

01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:20.397
And then?

01:06:20.689 --> 01:06:22.524
Hey guys, the teacher's back!

01:06:34.369 --> 01:06:36.205
WELCOME MR. MINISTER

01:06:37.664 --> 01:06:38.499
Here they are.

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:42.794
I want you to be exemplary.

01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:45.714
The first one who laughs
will regret it for life. Ok?

01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:54.431
Like that. That's good.

01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:57.017
That's very good.

01:07:12.866 --> 01:07:14.952
Sit down, children.

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:23.126
How's the school year coming along?

01:07:28.757 --> 01:07:31.885
These children need to loosen up.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:35.055
Why don't we play a guessing game?

01:07:35.514 --> 01:07:36.640
Listen carefully...

01:07:37.015 --> 01:07:38.600
What is yellow,

01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:40.561
very tiny,

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:42.729
and goes snap, crackle, pop?

01:07:48.986 --> 01:07:51.989
A baby chick eating Cracker Jacks!

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:06.378
-What are you studying?
Rivers.

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:08.005
Rivers...

01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:11.049
Then let's test someone.

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:13.302
Of course.
Agnan, please stand up.

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.345
No, no. Not you.

01:08:16.013 --> 01:08:17.389
You, over there.

01:08:20.642 --> 01:08:22.269
What is your name?

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:24.604
Clotaire, sir.

01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:28.774
Very well then.
T ell me, which river

01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:31.111
runs through Paris?

01:08:39.161 --> 01:08:42.456
I'm listening...
The river that runs through Paris?

01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:01.058
Didn't your parents
take you on a riverboat ride?

01:09:06.145 --> 01:09:07.689
Swimming Forbidden In The Seine

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:11.819
The Seine?

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.206
Bravo, Clotaire!

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:27.376
Was it that hard?

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:28.585
Oh, yes.

01:09:35.341 --> 01:09:36.426
How's the deal going?

01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:38.929
-I think we should be firm.
But we mustn't...

01:09:39.095 --> 01:09:40.973
-What's the timeframe?
Ten days.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:41.890
I think that...

01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:44.225
Keep me informed
of any developments.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.024
-Hello?
Hi, it's me.

01:09:52.442 --> 01:09:54.361
Did he say anything to you?

01:10:06.623 --> 01:10:08.250
I know how we'll make the money.

01:10:44.077 --> 01:10:46.997
Hey guys,
you want to be unbeatable?

01:10:47.289 --> 01:10:48.207
What do you mean?

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:50.542
Come to the vacant lot
and you'll see.

01:10:56.715 --> 01:10:57.633
And?

01:10:58.091 --> 01:11:00.802
We found the formula
of the magic potion.

01:11:03.055 --> 01:11:05.349
It'll make you as strong as an ox.

01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:06.934
It costs five francs.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:08.519
How do we know it works?

01:11:09.061 --> 01:11:09.603
You there.

01:11:11.188 --> 01:11:11.772
Come here.

01:11:30.582 --> 01:11:31.291
Now,

01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:33.544
try to lift that.

01:12:33.937 --> 01:12:35.772
-Next!
Paid.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.320
Paid.

01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:57.169
We won't have enough.

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.254
Rufus went to make some more.

01:13:18.816 --> 01:13:21.068
Three and four...

01:13:21.735 --> 01:13:23.654
and five make...

01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:25.239
five hundred and thirty francs!

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:26.949
Hey, you!

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:28.116
Little rascals!

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:30.494
Look what you did to my boy!

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.706
I want to see your parents!
You brats!

01:13:40.087 --> 01:13:43.006
Come back here.

01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:45.509
Come on run,
we'll catch them.

01:13:45.676 --> 01:13:48.345
You won't get away!
I'll catch you!

01:13:48.971 --> 01:13:51.932
Come here!
Come back here.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:57.729
We have the money.

01:13:58.147 --> 01:14:00.190
Ok, where's the car?

01:14:01.608 --> 01:14:02.609
We'll call you back.

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:05.696
Now he wants a car.

01:14:06.363 --> 01:14:07.990
We'll never see the end of it.

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:29.553
What flavor, sir?

01:14:31.638 --> 01:14:32.347
Excuse me?

01:14:33.807 --> 01:14:34.766
Chocolate-strawberry.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:35.976
Very well, sir.

01:14:54.036 --> 01:14:56.413
Hurry up, the others are waiting.

01:14:57.998 --> 01:14:58.749
What?

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:00.876
I don't know how to drive.

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:02.753
You have to turn the key.

01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:03.837
He took it with him.

01:15:04.087 --> 01:15:05.380
We'll fix the wires.

01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:07.382
I saw it in a film.
Keep watch.

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:08.342
You, help me.

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:15.390
What's going on?

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:18.310
Chocolate-strawberry.

01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:23.774
Move aside!

01:15:24.024 --> 01:15:24.817
Move aside!

01:15:37.538 --> 01:15:40.249
City driving: Ok.

01:15:40.457 --> 01:15:42.793
Downshifting and braking: Ok.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:45.879
Let's see if you can parallel park.

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:48.590
Park over there.

01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:49.758
Ok.

01:15:54.429 --> 01:15:56.473
What the... Follow them!

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.558
-But...
Follow them!

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:00.227
I said, follow them!

01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:03.897
Out of my way!

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:05.357
Out of my way!

01:16:05.566 --> 01:16:06.984
Faster! We'll catch them.

01:16:07.234 --> 01:16:08.777
I'll have his license revoked!

01:16:13.949 --> 01:16:14.950
Out of my way!

01:16:16.201 --> 01:16:17.244
Out of my way!

01:16:18.871 --> 01:16:20.122
Pass them!

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:29.673
I need men I can trust.

01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:31.800
I won't live forever, you know.

01:16:31.967 --> 01:16:35.012
I need to think about
who'll take over one day.

01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:36.555
Watch out!

01:16:42.936 --> 01:16:44.354
Well, I do say...

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.982
Good thing you were there.

01:16:47.983 --> 01:16:51.278
T ell me, what's your opinion
on the Patemouille file?

01:16:51.487 --> 01:16:53.197
I think we should accept.

01:16:53.363 --> 01:16:54.031
I think that...

01:16:54.323 --> 01:16:55.866
Ok, you handle the deal.

01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:57.618
-But...
Shut up.

01:16:57.784 --> 01:16:58.994
I didn't mean you.

01:17:31.401 --> 01:17:33.111
Parallel parking: Ok.

01:17:33.529 --> 01:17:34.530
Thank you.

01:17:58.303 --> 01:17:59.513
That'll never work.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:05.185
What do we do now?

01:18:05.352 --> 01:18:06.603
I don't know.

01:18:09.773 --> 01:18:11.191
How did we get here?

01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:18.115
Hello? I'd like
to speak to Blind Jack, please.

01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:20.826
Ok, I'll hold.

01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:23.328
Hey look! It's Joachim.

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:26.165
Hi guys.

01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:29.168
I thought you'd disappeared.

01:18:29.334 --> 01:18:32.546
No, I just came down
with a case of the chickenpox.

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:35.757
This is my brother.

01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:38.051
Isn't he cute?

01:18:40.804 --> 01:18:42.848
Don't touch!
You'll give him germs.

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:43.891
Babies are fragile.

01:18:47.853 --> 01:18:49.313
Did you hear?
He said my name.

01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:51.732
I thought you didn't like him.

01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:53.358
That was before.

01:18:53.859 --> 01:18:54.818
Before what?

01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:57.613
Before I knew how great it was.

01:18:58.363 --> 01:19:00.991
I'll be able to teach him
lots of things...

01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:02.993
Like soccer and riding a bike.

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:05.120
And my parents will say things like:

01:19:05.329 --> 01:19:08.248
"When Joachim was your age,
he could do that."

01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:10.834
He'll be very impressed

01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:14.004
and I'll give him orders
and he'll do everything I say.

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:17.090
Ok, bye guys.

01:19:27.768 --> 01:19:28.685
Hello?

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:30.979
Hello?

01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:39.696
I'll never drive again
as long as I live.

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:41.782
I don't understand.

01:19:42.115 --> 01:19:43.575
Never ever.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.911
Mom! Dad!

01:19:46.787 --> 01:19:48.747
Thank you, I'm so happy.

01:19:48.872 --> 01:19:50.791
-About what?
About my little brother!

01:19:51.124 --> 01:19:52.709
What little brother?

01:19:52.835 --> 01:19:55.420
My little brother...
The baby Mom's going to have.

01:19:57.798 --> 01:19:58.966
I'm not having a baby.

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:01.969
Who gave you that idea?

01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:03.345
But...

01:20:04.555 --> 01:20:06.014
I wanted a little brother.

01:20:06.598 --> 01:20:08.767
Little brothers are terrific.

01:20:09.768 --> 01:20:11.562
Why can't I have one?

01:20:13.814 --> 01:20:16.108
You never do anything
to make me happy.

01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:10.472
That night, after dinner,

01:22:10.848 --> 01:22:14.476
Mom and Dad kept on laughing
in their bedroom.

01:22:16.145 --> 01:22:18.897
And one day,
when I came home from school,

01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:26.113
they had some good news for me.

01:22:30.117 --> 01:22:31.869
The baby took a long time.

01:22:32.035 --> 01:22:36.248
I don't know how long, but it was
longer than waiting for Christmas.

01:22:36.415 --> 01:22:38.667
The day after tomorrow?
-Not yet.

01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:43.297
Life went on.

01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:51.638
Geoffroy got punished
for the car incident.

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:55.684
Now he has to walk to school.

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.524
I saw Marie-Edwige
and she invited me to her birthday.

01:23:02.774 --> 01:23:03.984
It's on Thursday.

01:23:04.276 --> 01:23:07.446
Thursday? I'll have to see,
I have a very busy schedule.

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:11.533
Ok, it was more like...

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.080
We have another new neighbor.

01:23:17.289 --> 01:23:18.582
What's the problem?

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:20.667
He and Dad tease each other too.

01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:22.336
Just try it.
-You don't scare me.

01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:23.837
You don't scare me.

01:23:25.047 --> 01:23:26.298
Go back home!

01:23:27.674 --> 01:23:29.426
And I kept waiting.

01:23:29.593 --> 01:23:32.179
Tomorrow?
-No, but very soon.

01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:36.141
I was in a hurry to start teaching
my little brother new things.

01:23:38.977 --> 01:23:40.103
Good!

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:47.236
Look!

01:23:50.781 --> 01:23:52.199
And then one morning,

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:55.285
we all went to the hospital...

01:23:57.037 --> 01:23:59.331
and my little brother
finally arrived.

01:24:00.958 --> 01:24:01.792
It's a girl.

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:03.627
What?

01:24:05.796 --> 01:24:06.880
Come on, shoot!

01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:09.967
Go on, shoot.

01:24:12.469 --> 01:24:13.303
Look!

01:24:21.603 --> 01:24:23.981
My goodness, isn't she cute?

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:25.732
She's an angel.

01:24:25.941 --> 01:24:28.610
She certainly
does have her father's jaw.

01:24:28.819 --> 01:24:30.737
She's her mother's spitting image.

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:32.239
I'm sorry, not the jaw.

01:24:40.664 --> 01:24:42.457
How do you like your sister?

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:44.793
Frankly, it's hard to say.

01:24:45.544 --> 01:24:48.839
We'll see when she's done.
For now she's toothless and bald.

01:24:49.006 --> 01:24:50.591
She's cute anyhow.

01:24:50.883 --> 01:24:51.758
Cute?

01:24:51.967 --> 01:24:53.135
She's red and wrinkled,

01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:54.845
Like a pickled pepper.

01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.433
She just stares into space
and gurgles.

01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:03.437
Everyone says she's smiling,
but that's a joke.

01:25:03.604 --> 01:25:05.314
All she does is gurgle.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.693
I wanted a brother.

01:25:09.902 --> 01:25:12.488
But at the hospital,
Mom took this instead.

01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:13.864
I don't know why.

01:25:16.575 --> 01:25:18.744
She has rolls of fat everywhere,

01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:20.996
she looks like she has four cheeks.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.127
I should've asked for a puppy.

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:37.429
It's funny,

01:25:39.473 --> 01:25:43.519
but at that moment, I remembered
the teacher's writing assignment:

01:25:45.187 --> 01:25:49.191
Tell me what you want to be
when you grow up.

01:25:53.195 --> 01:25:55.072
Because now I know.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.786
What I want to do when I grow up

01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:03.163
is make people laugh.

01:26:11.004 --> 01:26:12.005
Look here!

01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:14.591
Look here!
