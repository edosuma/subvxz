WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:07.507
Wait.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.718
At least let me tell you the idea I have.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.761
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.845 --> 00:12.887
Go on, then.

00:12.971 --> 00:13.972
Idea for what?

00:14.848 --> 00:17.600
Karina leaving doesn't mean
the group has to end.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.061
Why the fuck do you need us?

00:20.145 --> 00:21.980
You're the best dancers I know.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.691
Together we can do a lot of things.

00:24.774 --> 00:28.820
Sure. Just admit you're doing all this
to take revenge on Karina.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.823
No, that's not true.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.451
Do you deny
you're angry she took your role?

00:37.245 --> 00:40.457
Well, yes. But that's not why I'm here.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.042
Let's try it.

00:42.917 --> 00:46.463
You've got the flow.
I've got the contacts. We all win.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.548
Pura Kaye is over.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.138
Wait.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.809
Help me convince them.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.020
I know you can.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.691
Get something concrete and we'll talk.

01:07.901 --> 01:11.863
So, if this guy answers,
what are you going to say?

01:12.739 --> 01:13.740
No, well…

01:20.205 --> 01:21.247
And Ximena?

01:21.956 --> 01:24.876
Don't think
you'll convince Ximena that quickly.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.422
Dude, that guy is here in Bogotá.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.592
What are you going to do?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.512
What do you mean? I'm going to call him.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.098
But you need to get me the number.

01:40.850 --> 01:44.104
I forgot my magic wand, honey.
I didn't bring it today.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.940
-How do I get it?
-I'm serious. Please.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.525
Where do I get it?

01:49.943 --> 01:50.944
Karina.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.871
<i>What's up, girl?</i>
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:03.581
<i>Can you give me Joy's number?</i>

02:03.665 --> 02:07.627
<i>I know a guy who sings really well,</i>
<i>and I want to help him. It's all good.</i>

02:13.550 --> 02:14.884
Hello, darling.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.052
How was it?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.515
Truthfully, harder than I thought.

02:21.224 --> 02:25.520
Don't worry about it.
Everything has a solution.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.898
I just want to know
what that school is like.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.487
That place is

02:35.989 --> 02:36.948
incredible.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.201
<i>It's enormous. The columns are big.</i>

02:40.910 --> 02:43.830
<i>From the moment you walk in,</i>
<i>you breathe dance.</i>

02:43.913 --> 02:45.582
<i>The dancers look like they float.</i>

02:46.499 --> 02:48.585
<i>It's like they're from a fairy tale.</i>

02:58.011 --> 03:00.263
<i>Everything that happens</i>
<i>at the Royal is magic.</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:04.017
Wait, stop. I don't understand.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.854
I don't get what's happening.
It's not that way, Karina.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.566
You're supposed to be leading everyone,
and you're lost.

03:11.649 --> 03:12.859
Imagine the rest.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.654
María José, Antonia,
what's with the timing?

03:20.950 --> 03:27.916
JOY: WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

03:41.095 --> 03:42.096
Hello.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.850
I have over ten missed calls. Who is this?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.061
Yes, I'm sorry.

03:48.853 --> 03:51.856
-<i>Who are you?</i>
-I'm part of Pura Kaye.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.442
-We're getting back together.
-<i>Karina?</i>

03:55.026 --> 03:57.528
No, I'm Antonia Pombo.

03:57.612 --> 04:02.200
I'm a new member of the group,
and I wanted to talk to you.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.327
<i>I'm very busy right now.</i>

04:04.410 --> 04:08.289
I don't give second chances, lady.
Good luck with your group.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.374
Jo…

04:11.417 --> 04:12.293
Fuck.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.011
No, sweetie. Relax.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.888
What we need is to sell.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.475
This is really small,
and you can see everything.

04:27.558 --> 04:29.727
I know more than ten girls

04:29.811 --> 04:33.773
who would like to take these photos,
willingly and for less.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.401
So don't be a pain. And here. Put this on.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.861
There.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.920
Hi. Did you get anything?

05:04.178 --> 05:05.179
What's going on?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.515
I'm looking for my wigs.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.477
Where are my wigs?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
I had to get back what I lost somehow.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.442
You sold them?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.528
Ximena, don't be shameless.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.407
You and the Venezuelan need
to empty the room. I've rented it out.

05:25.616 --> 05:27.744
So you're leaving me homeless?

05:27.827 --> 05:28.745
No, you'll see.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.832
If you like, I'll tell the police
you know who came to rob the salon.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.878
What are you talking about?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.047
What everyone is talking about.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.215
Isn't it odd?

05:41.924 --> 05:44.260
It's a strange coincidence
that your boyfriend,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.095
a day after I was robbed,

05:46.679 --> 05:47.680
went missing.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.432
Odd, isn't it?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.434
You know what? I'm going.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.479
Screw you and your room.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.939
You have until noon, Ximena.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.661
-That's the scumbag, right?
-Yeah.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.086
-Is this job necessary?
-It wasn't necessary.

06:18.169 --> 06:21.506
But seeing as you left the area,
it's necessary now.

06:22.590 --> 06:23.591
Go on, then.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.219
Go on, then. Let's see you.

06:38.272 --> 06:39.857
Dude, how's it going?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.317
Do you remember me?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.295
Let's go, Karina.

07:01.379 --> 07:06.008
Is Romeo slaughtered, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin and my dearer lord?

07:06.092 --> 07:07.009
Okay.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.720
She just received
the worst news of her life.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.348
Feel it. Let's go.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.684
Seven and…

07:23.484 --> 07:28.364
Sound the general doom!
For who is living if those two are gone?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.783
More intensity, Karina.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.786
Take over the role. You have it.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.621
Come on. You can do it.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.290
Seven and…

07:47.633 --> 07:50.761
I think that's enough for today, guys.
Take a break.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.355
-You haven't read <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>
-No. Not at all.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.609
I can read it if you lend it to me.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.835
There's a line of dancers outside
who would give their life for this role.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.549
But I'm looking for perfection,
and I want yours.

08:29.175 --> 08:33.387
I'm sorry. I've had a bad day.
My brother is in trouble--

08:33.471 --> 08:35.681
I know you have problems. We all do.

08:37.308 --> 08:41.521
But during rehearsals and the show,
you need to leave them outside.

08:42.396 --> 08:43.397
No, I know.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.483
But…

08:46.776 --> 08:47.818
I'm not a robot.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.863
If I wanted one, I have ten in there.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.991
I'm looking for something more.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.911
And in you, I see something more.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.206
I don't get what you see in me.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.762
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

09:17.723 --> 09:19.058
I want you to read it.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.144
Enjoy it. Study it.

09:23.771 --> 09:28.734
If you want to be on that stage
and show the world what you can do,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.403
you have to make a sacrifice.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.698
You have to get up early.
Stay up all night.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.450
Slog your guts out
in every rehearsal, Karina.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.871
Otherwise, Karina,
however much I believe in you,

09:41.747 --> 09:43.833
however much I believe in your talent,

09:45.084 --> 09:48.629
your days in this company
will end faster than they began.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.467
-I'll give it my all.
-I know.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.970
-I know.
-Thank you.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.516
There you go.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.476
Get on with it.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.033
-Ready?
-Ready.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.078
-Sister.
-Good to meet you.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.163
-Okay.
-Be seeing you.

10:22.663 --> 10:25.916
-How are you?
-Good. Free, at least.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.545
-Get your act together, okay?
-Okay.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.550
Thanks, bro.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.846
-I'll take you home.
-No, it's fine. It's all good.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.641
But it's complicated getting the bus now.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.101
Come on.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.372
Wow, your hair!

11:05.539 --> 11:08.125
I love that look. It suits you.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.005
-What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?
-You're shameless.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.050
You were really shitty with my brother.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.137
That whole story, even before it began,

11:21.389 --> 11:22.765
was fucked, right?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.017
What story? What's going on?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.353
Nothing. We're talking about the past.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.399
Your life is so colorful.

11:32.066 --> 11:32.900
Check it out.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.534
What did you see in him?

11:43.327 --> 11:44.161
I don't know.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.122
-Shall we go?
-Let's go.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.512
Here she is.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.390
I told Grandma you were working, remember?

12:04.473 --> 12:05.474
It's all good.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.812
Hey, Granny. This is beautiful.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.605
-How are you?
-You scared me, darling.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.232
Come and meet Grandma.

12:13.315 --> 12:16.110
How was it, darling? Hello, sweetie.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.028
-Hi, Granny.
-Hello.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.947
-Let me introduce you to…
-Hello.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.158
Vicente, he's a friend of Álex's.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.536
Pleasure to meet you, Vicente.
How are you?

12:25.619 --> 12:28.205
-Very well.
-How long have you known each other?

12:30.166 --> 12:33.085
-Not long.
-I have to go.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.712
-Again?
-Yes.

12:34.795 --> 12:35.713
Hey.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.923
-Oh, no.
-Where are you going?

12:38.007 --> 12:39.425
-Okay.
-To run an errand.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.471
-A pleasure, Mrs. Neila.
-Okay, take care.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.431
-Nice to meet you.
-Same here.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.974
Take care of yourself.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.727
Do you have a crush on him?

12:52.354 --> 12:53.814
Be patient with him.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.234
Okay.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.738
-See you tomorrow.
-Can I ask you something?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.951
Do you think I'm bad at acting?

13:06.911 --> 13:07.995
You're not awful,

13:08.078 --> 13:12.166
but if you want to be the lead,
you do have to make more of an effort.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.337
I don't know who else to ask.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.839
Would you help me?

13:24.845 --> 13:26.555
Don't worry about this, okay?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.474
It's all organized.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.023
Don't put a lot of clothes on top.
Don't make it too heavy.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.694
You'll have this with you.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.113
So you have control over everything.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.991
If you're being followed,
you can get rid of it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.076
Got it?

13:50.246 --> 13:52.248
How many times have you done this?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.834
A package goes every week.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.294
When am I going?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.796
Tomorrow.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.880
Tomorrow?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.010
Not tomorrow.
I haven't packed. I'm not ready.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.805
You asked me for a favor. Remember?

14:08.514 --> 14:11.433
So don't worry.
Tomorrow you'll see your mom.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.271
Another thing.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.774
My friend is serious.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.026
This is half of what we agreed on.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.780
You get the rest when you deliver the bag.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.869
Okay?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.874
I'm Antonia Pombo. I work with Joy.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.836
I need to leave him an envelope,
but I need his room number.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.839
-Can you remind me of it?
-No worries. One moment.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.176
He's in room 605.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.012
-Thanks so much.
-My pleasure.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.472
-Don't forget this.
-Of course.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.557
Thank you.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.518
HOTEL BOOKING CONFIRMATION

15:00.399 --> 15:04.153
Antonia, what the hell is happening?
I don't understand.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.155
I'll explain later, okay?

15:11.118 --> 15:12.119
Come on.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.258
We don't even have
an appointment with the guy?

15:27.801 --> 15:28.969
Fuck.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.981
There's no one there.
The man who was in there just left.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.777
We were in there with him,
and I left something inside.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.737
They're rehearsing.

15:47.404 --> 15:48.238
Where?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.616
In the rooms on the first floor.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.118
Thanks very much.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.037
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.943
GRAND 3 SALON

16:42.334 --> 16:43.961
Very good, guys.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.172
-Hello.
-Hello.

16:48.882 --> 16:52.136
I'm Antonia, she's Bombita,
and we're Pura Kaye.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.846
Okay.

16:53.929 --> 16:59.393
I spoke with Joy, and he told me
you needed dancers, so…

17:00.936 --> 17:04.481
We're looking for dancers,
but the audition isn't today or here.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.862
But we're here now, aren't we?
Why don't you take a look at us?

17:18.495 --> 17:19.997
What are you doing here?

17:20.581 --> 17:22.374
The lady and I have business.

17:23.292 --> 17:24.418
Is there a problem?

17:25.002 --> 17:26.962
No. What do you mean?

17:28.672 --> 17:29.673
What business?

17:30.716 --> 17:33.302
Dude, I think you and I
have finished for today.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.679
You can go home now. All good. Thanks.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.728
Okay. See you later.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.189
-Hope it goes well.
-Thanks.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.357
What's the occasion?

17:49.526 --> 17:50.694
I came to pay you back.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.159
And to say goodbye. I'm going to Miami.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.165
Don't break my heart with that, my love.
Don't laugh.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.250
I'm serious.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.754
Are you saying you have a heart?

18:10.422 --> 18:13.550
You think behind this businessman persona,
I'm not sensitive?

18:13.634 --> 18:16.053
With a devoted heart? And a will to love?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.889
Don't laugh. I'm being serious.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.810
Come on.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.438
Why don't we go out
and get to know each other before you go?

18:27.731 --> 18:29.108
I'm leaving tomorrow.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.568
Let's go out today. Let's go dancing.

18:33.821 --> 18:34.863
I can't.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.121
I'm going tomorrow, and if not…

18:42.204 --> 18:43.330
If not, what?

18:45.707 --> 18:46.542
What?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.168
Are you a big man?

18:50.629 --> 18:51.964
If you don't go, what?

18:53.924 --> 18:54.925
If I don't go…

18:59.930 --> 19:02.057
What? Are you angry?

20:05.537 --> 20:07.331
-Who are they?
-Pura Kaye.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.709
Didn't you get what I said on the phone?

20:12.336 --> 20:15.547
-We just wanted you to see us--
-You just nothing. You fucked up.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.467
I don't work with people
who don't respect others.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.969
Sorry. That wasn't my intention.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.639
Joy, wait.

20:27.517 --> 20:29.311
What a waste of time, Antonia.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.118
You're the only one who follows her game.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.704
-I know.
-Chama, dude, no.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.874
If you want, stay in my room.
I'm not sleeping here.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.794
You'll be nice and comfortable.

20:58.006 --> 20:58.966
Expecting someone?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.678
Who's coming?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.140
Ximena just arrived.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.017
Come on.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.855
Checho, why don't you stay here?
No one will know.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.066
Stay here so they come and catch me?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.652
No. I'm off.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.155
Are you still working
with that guy? Curro?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.657
Isn't he dangerous?

21:24.616 --> 21:25.951
What's it to you?

21:26.535 --> 21:28.412
We're seeing where to sleep.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.081
No, it's fine.

21:31.164 --> 21:34.501
-I don't need to unpack.
-Aren't we all staying here?

21:35.085 --> 21:36.545
No, I'm leaving tomorrow.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.839
Where are you going?

21:41.174 --> 21:42.634
You won't believe me.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.139
I'm going to Miami.

21:47.889 --> 21:48.724
Miami?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.810
Yes, to see my mom.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.813
She got the money
and sent it to me, and I'm going.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.108
-Why the fuck didn't you say?
-What do you mean?

21:58.608 --> 22:00.861
We spoke about this, remember?

22:03.447 --> 22:07.034
Anyway, girl,
me going doesn't mean I'm dying.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.619
I'm going to do what I like best.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.372
Pure scandal.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.876
Come here.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.505
I'm going to miss you.

22:21.214 --> 22:22.049
Me too.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.554
Don't cry. Princesses don't cry.
Or our crowns would fall off.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.685
-Can I leave this in your room?
-Of course.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.943
What are you up to with Curro, dude?

22:44.154 --> 22:46.323
Is it to do with this impromptu trip?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.783
It doesn't concern you.

22:48.867 --> 22:49.910
We're nothing.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.704
Do I ask you about that redhead? No.

22:53.955 --> 22:57.584
-So there's something between you?
-You've got a lot of nerve.

22:58.293 --> 23:02.547
When Curro had me locked up,
you didn't come. Not even a call, asshole.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.342
And now you see me with him
and you give me grief?

23:05.425 --> 23:08.637
-Don't be stupid. It's not that.
-Don't call me stupid.

23:09.262 --> 23:12.140
-Curro is a dangerous man.
-I know he is.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.936
And I love how
he has bigger balls than you.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.357
Girl, you can't leave
until we've given you a proper goodbye.

23:23.193 --> 23:27.280
"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."

23:27.364 --> 23:29.324
"What's Montague?"

23:29.408 --> 23:33.829
"It is nor… foot, nor…"
Why do they speak so convolutedly?

23:35.956 --> 23:36.957
Don't they?

23:37.541 --> 23:38.542
Differently.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.335
But look.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.880
The beauty of Shakespeare's plays
is that they sound like Shakespeare.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.008
And we're talking about a play from 1597.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.719
What beauty do you see?
With all due respect.

23:50.303 --> 23:51.304
Passion.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.349
Is that how your knee got like that?

23:56.351 --> 23:59.604
I've seen that it bothers you
a lot in rehearsals.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.689
It's not too bad.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.614
-Hi.
-<i>Ximena is going to the US tomorrow.</i>

24:10.198 --> 24:12.701
Her mom sped it up
so she could leave faster.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.745
We're going to have a goodbye party
on Checho's terrace.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.998
<i>Can you come? We'll be here.</i>

24:37.893 --> 24:39.603
XIMENA
LIKED BY NACHO22 AND 132 OTHERS

24:39.686 --> 24:41.396
XIMENA
LIKED BY PALOMA_33 AND 112 OTHERS

24:41.480 --> 24:44.316
XIMENA
LIKED BY KAMILLO11 AND 91 OTHERS

24:44.399 --> 24:45.859
-Girl.
-To Ximena.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.404
-You'll smash it!
-I love you girls.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.732
Checho, come here. Photo.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.442
Go on, then.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.864
-Yes, beautiful.
-I'll be back.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.200
Ximena, let's take a souvenir photo.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.371
Let's have a drink.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.873
Great. Gimme.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.003
Fuck.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.301
For Pura Kaye, right?

25:54.094 --> 25:55.428
A lot of history here.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.764
-Look what I brought.
-No.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.225
So you don't forget
we're more than a fight.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.144
You still have this? You idiot!

26:03.812 --> 26:08.066
That day was awesome, dude.
Do you remember? We smashed it.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.277
Put it on.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.612
Yes! Put it on.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.781
-One moment.
-Shall we all put one on?

26:57.949 --> 27:01.286
Bravo! Shall we have a drink or what?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.164
Look.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.542
-Are you not drinking?
-Mine's there. What do you mean?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.088
Everything we've been through.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.591
Dude, it's incredible…

27:16.301 --> 27:17.719
We'll see each other again.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.806
Still, I want you to know that…

27:24.934 --> 27:27.062
You've made me cry, goddamn it.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.608
Do you forgive me, then?

27:36.696 --> 27:38.114
Well, I have to.

27:39.532 --> 27:41.201
Are the Kayes back, then?

27:41.785 --> 27:44.037
Can't you see
that this idiot is leaving us?

27:46.790 --> 27:47.916
No, yeah.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.794
I have to go. My mom is waiting.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.923
What if you stay and we try again?

27:55.507 --> 27:57.509
It would be amazing, dude, but no.

27:59.552 --> 28:00.762
Well, then.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.683
Let this be our last toast.

28:05.266 --> 28:06.476
To Pura Kaye.

28:09.354 --> 28:10.772
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.942
-To old times.
-Bottoms up.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.362
Cheers, girls.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.701
Are we going to say goodbye, then?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.079
Let me tell you.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.625
For old times' sake.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.005
What are you playing at?

28:45.765 --> 28:46.725
No, lady.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.063
What would I be playing at?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.402
Ximena, let's get out of here.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.199
-No, wait a minute.
-What? Let me.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.162
Checho, let's fuck.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.840
Checho, what's going on?

30:00.882 --> 30:01.716
SLIDE TO CANCEL

30:01.800 --> 30:07.222
I'm worried now. I've called you
a few times and nothing. You okay?

30:24.113 --> 30:26.533
ANTONIA
VOICE MESSAGE

30:43.049 --> 30:44.676
Drink.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.973
I can't. I have rehearsal tomorrow.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.600
I have a thousand things in my head.
I have to be…

30:52.684 --> 30:57.021
You're going to start rubbing
the super academy in our faces.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.024
No, Bombita. What's the problem, dude?

31:00.733 --> 31:04.404
What happened with Pura Kaye
was everyone's decision, not just mine.

31:04.487 --> 31:05.488
No.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.200
-That's not true.
-How so?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.452
I was set on the show.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.998
I tried a thousand times to find a way.
One thing, then another.

31:15.081 --> 31:17.083
Dude, you caused a shit show.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.460
Ximena left.

31:20.628 --> 31:24.048
And you didn't give a shit about
what happened with Chama and me.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.634
Why do we have to talk about this now?

31:28.636 --> 31:30.471
-I had an audition today.
-Dude.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.057
With Antonia.

31:34.017 --> 31:34.851
What?

31:35.643 --> 31:38.980
And we did it as Pura Kaye,
and it went really well.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.151
Why with Antonia?

31:44.903 --> 31:45.862
She called me.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.823
She offered me an opportunity,
and I said yes.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.287
Well, I don't know,
but you can't accept that.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.663
We can't?

31:56.581 --> 32:01.961
So you can be in an academy,
be a star, and shine.

32:02.545 --> 32:06.382
Ximena can go to the US,
and we can't what?

32:07.842 --> 32:11.262
I'm sick of undressing for photographs.

32:11.346 --> 32:15.016
Dude, I want to achieve our dreams too.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.770
Chama and I deserve
to achieve our dreams, Karina.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.357
Cheers.

32:34.118 --> 32:40.083
JOY: YOU WON, GIRL.
THE CHOREOGRAPHER WANTS YOU.

32:48.049 --> 32:52.178
"My lips…
two blushing pilgrims, ready stand."

32:52.261 --> 32:56.057
"To smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss."

32:56.140 --> 32:57.141
Been here long?

32:58.226 --> 32:59.560
Yes, I got here early.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.732
-How's Shakespeare treating you?
-I'm trying to understand it, but…

33:05.858 --> 33:06.859
It's difficult.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.279
Let's see.

33:12.949 --> 33:16.494
This is a play, Karina,
about an impossible love.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.204
In this scene in particular,

33:19.330 --> 33:23.835
the conservative customs
of your character, Juliet,

33:23.918 --> 33:26.462
make her resist a kiss.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.590
But deep down she wants it.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.761
Have you ever been in love?

33:36.014 --> 33:40.018
I ask you because there are many ways
of approaching a character.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.311
One of them is appropriating it.

33:42.395 --> 33:46.441
Transferring your own experiences onto it
in order to find its truth.

33:47.275 --> 33:51.404
Yes, I understand, but it's easier for you
because you studied it. I…

33:54.032 --> 33:55.158
Let's do an exercise.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.668
Take a look at the changes.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.508
"…strong, a woman like me…"

34:17.930 --> 34:19.390
Karina, come here, please.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.227
Let's do the scene.

34:24.270 --> 34:26.898
I want you to relax, breathe deeply.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.778
Ready?

34:38.785 --> 34:40.620
"May I take your hand?"

34:42.705 --> 34:44.874
"Perhaps you could forgive me a kiss."

34:47.168 --> 34:49.253
"That wouldn't be good on your part."

34:50.254 --> 34:54.967
"A woman like me
couldn't kiss someone like you."

35:00.306 --> 35:01.474
A woman like you?

35:03.434 --> 35:06.062
What's the difference
between your lips and mine?

35:09.732 --> 35:10.942
My lips pray.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.861
They don't sin.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.865
It's as if you don't want it, Juliet.

37:31.832 --> 37:36.420
