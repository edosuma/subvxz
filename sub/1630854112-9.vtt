Ma'am, can you open your door?

Whoa.

Hey, what, uh, what happened?
I heard a shout.

-BOBBY: Ma'am?

20:38.629 --> 20:41.555

You know,
not without letting them go,

40:36.250 --> 40:37.767
so she held onto it
until she passed,

40:37.844 --> 40:39.102
which was last year.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.419
How did you find out all this?

40:40.513 --> 40:42.497
I tracked down
the current owner,

40:42.590 --> 40:43.606
her nephew.

40:43.758 --> 40:45.333
He hasn't even put it
on the market yet.

40:45.426 --> 40:46.501
He didn't want
to throw the doors open

40:46.519 --> 40:49.595
to all the vultures
and lookie-loos.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.264
He hasn't even been inside
in a decade.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.451
That's why it looks like this.

40:55.695 --> 40:57.512
MADDIE:
It's a height chart.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.197
Three girls.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.957
Wow.

41:01.184 --> 41:03.168
A family lived here.

41:07.281 --> 41:10.383
I think a family
should live here again.
