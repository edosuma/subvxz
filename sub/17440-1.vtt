00:14.544 --> 00:17.044
<i>And now the moment when
they're about to lose...</i>

00:17.045 --> 00:19.544
<i>...radio contact on the
far side of the moon.</i>

00:29.919 --> 00:32.503
OK... Let's make sure that
we don't do anything...

00:32.543 --> 00:36.544
...that's going to blow our CSM
electrical power with the batteries,

00:36.545 --> 00:40.544
...or that will cause us to lose
the main for the fuel cell no. 2.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.711
<i>Despite the gravity of the situation
the flat American voices...</i>

00:47.794 --> 00:50.794
<i>...retain their matter of fact tone
that has characterised so much...</i>

00:52.211 --> 00:55.211
It's unlocked, come in.

00:57.128 --> 01:00.128
I thought you'd come. Just a moment,
I don't want to miss this.

01:01.503 --> 01:05.336
<i>There's something coming through.
It's a response from Ferguson.</i>

01:06.003 --> 01:08.878
<i>Commander Ferguson responding
to Control's suggestions.</i>

01:09.711 --> 01:16.711
We're down to 10 miles, Geoff.
There's still no response from the Control.

01:16.961 --> 01:20.628
Understood, 6. We still show no fault here.

01:21.419 --> 01:24.419
Keep your finger on that
switch - we're still searching.

01:24.919 --> 01:28.919
I've poured you a drink.
We ought to be civilised about it.

01:34.128 --> 01:37.419
<i>Those were the last words,
they've lost radio contact.</i>

01:39.461 --> 01:42.253
<i>Achilles Six, the mission
that was to inaugurate...</i>

01:42.544 --> 01:44.878
<i>...man's first permanent
station on the moon,</i>

01:45.169 --> 01:48.253
<i>is locked into an orbit that,
unless some miracle occurs,</i>

01:48.544 --> 01:51.544
<i>...will produce the first
American disaster in space.</i>

01:55.169 --> 01:58.253
A response at last.

02:10.002 --> 02:16.003
<i>In a strange way, those men in that</i>
tiny craft have become a family to us all...

04:03.253 --> 04:06.003
About two hours, I'd say.
He's still soft.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.003
When it comes to violence,

04:11.253 --> 04:12.878
there really is a common market.

04:14.461 --> 04:15.878
I wouldn't...

04:16.043 --> 04:18.043
...spoil your breakfast.

04:20.711 --> 04:22.711
Oh, Jesus.

04:24.211 --> 04:26.294
Talk about beating somebody's brains out.

04:27.669 --> 04:29.211
He was a writer.

04:31.544 --> 04:33.378
Is that what you do with
writers in England?

04:34.753 --> 04:36.794
Oh, please, would you...?

04:43.503 --> 04:45.794
- That's the first one I've ever had.
- First what?

04:46.128 --> 04:48.961
Writer. It's what you might call
a turn up for the books.

04:51.503 --> 04:52.461
Sorry, sir.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.711
What did you find?

04:55.961 --> 04:59.503
The man next door reported to the night
porter, who found the body and called us.

05:00.044 --> 05:02.294
Let's speak to the neighbour.

05:03.544 --> 05:04.711
Sergeant Duff.

05:06.336 --> 05:08.294
Was the TV set on when they found him?

05:10.211 --> 05:13.128
Yes sir, it was on when I came in.

05:25.544 --> 05:27.794
NO SIGN OF L.

05:33.086 --> 05:35.419
THE WEST FRONT

05:44.169 --> 05:47.711
I saw the door standing open.
It isn't wise these days.

05:48.003 --> 05:49.586
I called the Porter.

05:49.878 --> 05:51.878
You didn't see the body, Mr. Pennington?

05:54.044 --> 05:58.044
- Did you know Mr. Morlar well? - I didn't
know him at all. We were just neighbours.

05:58.253 --> 06:00.711
- Very British.
- I am British.

06:01.669 --> 06:03.669
Any visitors, girlfriends?

06:04.419 --> 06:06.836
- None that I've seen.
- Boyfriends?

06:09.211 --> 06:13.253
No. He may have been strange,
but not that way, I think.

06:15.794 --> 06:17.878
Would you know if he had any visitors?

06:18.836 --> 06:19.878
How do you mean?

06:20.169 --> 06:22.628
I mean, I can hear your TV set distinctly.

06:32.461 --> 06:35.794
Which means, you would be
able to hear anything in here...

06:36.086 --> 06:38.544
...like laughter, argument, loud noise.

06:39.669 --> 06:43.086
Not if my TV was on, it
drowns the noise, you see?

06:44.003 --> 06:45.169
I see.

06:46.169 --> 06:48.294
How did you discover what happened then?

06:48.878 --> 06:52.378
I took my milk bottles out
during one of the commercial breaks.

06:52.628 --> 06:55.586
His door was wide open.
I called the porter.

06:56.461 --> 06:58.461
Did you miss any of the programme?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.961
What about your wife?

07:03.253 --> 07:05.836
- My wife is dead.
- I'm sorry.

07:07.378 --> 07:09.044
Thank you, Mr. Pennington.

07:13.169 --> 07:15.086
What do you drink?

07:15.711 --> 07:16.669
Pardon?

07:17.878 --> 07:21.211
A drop of whisky. Why?

07:22.044 --> 07:23.003
No reason.

07:31.086 --> 07:34.044
Television will be the death
of crime detection.

07:34.294 --> 07:37.336
- How's that, Inspector?
- No one hears anything any more.

07:39.669 --> 07:41.669
Could I speak to the porter now?

07:50.128 --> 07:51.086
Listen.

07:56.794 --> 08:00.836
"There are more tears than smiles.
There is more sea than earth."

08:02.044 --> 08:06.086
One day the insupportable grief of mankind
will sweep over the land...

08:06.503 --> 08:09.961
...and an ark will float
on that liquid expression of misery...

08:12.211 --> 08:13.794
What do you make of that?

08:14.086 --> 08:16.211
I'm not much on modern literature.

08:18.794 --> 08:22.836
He's turned his TV off,
we've made some progress.

08:34.086 --> 08:35.961
It's not possible...

08:43.336 --> 08:44.669
My God.

08:45.628 --> 08:48.669
Call an ambulance quickly
and alert the hospital.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.586
How we fight against it...

08:59.961 --> 09:02.961
Will Dr. Patel
please go to the burns unit.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.586
Dr. Patel to the burns unit, please.

09:12.044 --> 09:15.044
All available nurses
are required to go to Casualty.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.169
They're busy, Jumbo crash.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.586
This is Sergeant Hughes,
he'll be on the first shift.

10:10.253 --> 10:13.503
- If he speaks one word, I want it.
- Yes, sir.

10:13.753 --> 10:14.919
The porter?

10:15.253 --> 10:18.294
He claimed came up when Pennington called
and found the man dead.

10:18.586 --> 10:20.711
He ran back down and called
us on his own phone.

10:21.669 --> 10:23.336
Any reason not to believe him?

10:23.669 --> 10:25.753
None I could see, but
I'm having him checked.

10:26.461 --> 10:30.211
- What about visitors?
- He didn't have any.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.961
He had one tonight.

10:33.878 --> 10:36.336
- Zonfeld?
- Never heard of him.

10:37.669 --> 10:39.378
Pick me up in the morning at 9.30.

10:41.503 --> 10:43.503
As soon as they'll let you in there.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.211
- So the TV wasn't on when it happened?
- Apparently not.

11:55.503 --> 11:57.711
Anyway, the porter said he
turned it on while waiting,

11:57.961 --> 12:00.836
...because the astronauts
had just gone behind the moon...

12:01.086 --> 12:04.169
All right, but we can't put him
to the guillotine for that.

12:05.711 --> 12:09.294
- Were there any prints?
- They were too smeared on the statue.

12:09.586 --> 12:12.044
The only clear prints on the TV
were the porter's.

12:12.836 --> 12:15.544
Just when I thought
I was going back in peace,

12:16.253 --> 12:19.211
...it begins to have the smell
of one of those cases.

12:19.628 --> 12:22.336
I don't know, Inspector, we found Zonfeld.

12:22.628 --> 12:25.378
It's only been 12 hours, it's not bad.

12:28.044 --> 12:30.294
Here we are, number 44.

12:31.711 --> 12:35.294
- Dr. Zonfeld, please.
- First floor, end of the corridor, left.

12:42.919 --> 12:44.919
Oop... merde!

13:01.169 --> 13:03.419
Good morning, I am Inspector Brunel.

13:03.711 --> 13:06.211
Oh, yes, Inspector Brunnel,
I told the Doctor you'd called.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.544
Bru-nel. Bru-nel.

13:08.711 --> 13:12.128
Doctor, Inspector Brunel
is here to see you.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.669
Terrible, isn't it?

13:19.711 --> 13:21.919
There aren't many Zonfelds
in the directory.

13:22.211 --> 13:23.211
No.

13:23.794 --> 13:25.544
- You're French.
- Yes.

13:25.919 --> 13:27.919
I hope Mr. Morlar isn't in any trouble.

13:28.253 --> 13:29.086
No.

13:29.211 --> 13:31.211
Dr. Zonfeld will see you now.

13:31.336 --> 13:32.336
Thank you.

13:42.628 --> 13:44.336
I expected a man.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.294
I'm sorry, I had no way of knowing.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.211
And I expected an English Inspector.

13:51.294 --> 13:55.003
In Paris right now, a Frenchman
is confronting that English Inspector...

13:55.294 --> 13:57.044
...and he is equally surprised.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.294
I see.

13:58.586 --> 14:01.544
We're trying to acquire
each other's weaknesses.

14:02.211 --> 14:04.169
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

14:06.211 --> 14:08.294
I'm calling about John Morlar.

14:08.628 --> 14:10.919
My secretary explained.

14:12.419 --> 14:16.294
May I ask if your relationship
with Mr. Morlar...

14:16.586 --> 14:18.669
...is personal or professional?

14:19.961 --> 14:22.086
Purely professional, he's a patient.

14:22.419 --> 14:24.253
He was found in his flat last night.

14:27.336 --> 14:28.294
Dead?

14:28.753 --> 14:31.461
Not quite, but he had been badly assaulted.

14:33.878 --> 14:34.878
Oh.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.044
I'm very sorry.

14:40.044 --> 14:43.794
- I assume he'll be all right, then.
- He will never be all right again.

14:48.586 --> 14:49.878
That's tragic.

14:52.753 --> 14:54.919
No one seems to know much about him.

14:56.211 --> 14:59.544
I know a good deal about him.

14:59.836 --> 15:02.419
But he had no enemies that I know of.
No friends either.

15:02.753 --> 15:05.419
- That was one of his problems.
- He must have had one enemy.

15:06.086 --> 15:09.446
Well, I don't see that that follows. But a
man may be attacked by a perfect stranger.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.128
There were two glasses laid out.

15:15.128 --> 15:17.586
One contained brandy and one whisky.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.003
How can I help you?

15:21.711 --> 15:23.294
Why did he come to you?

15:23.628 --> 15:26.711
I have a gift for disaster.

15:29.628 --> 15:33.669
- You seem to have survived it.
- I don't mean for me, but for others.

15:35.961 --> 15:38.628
Have you come to me to confirm this gift...

15:38.878 --> 15:41.461
...or to assist you in repudiating it?

15:41.753 --> 15:43.753
He had delusions.

15:44.044 --> 15:47.753
Most patients come because they feel
the world is too much for them.

15:48.044 --> 15:51.003
Mr. Morlar felt
he was too much for the world.

15:52.003 --> 15:55.253
In his case it began when a nanny he hated
died of measles.

15:55.544 --> 15:57.544
He believed he caused it.

15:57.878 --> 16:01.794
She was an Irish bitch, priest-ridden,
rosary-racked...

16:02.128 --> 16:05.003
...and in desperate need
of the consolation of the damned.

16:05.336 --> 16:06.878
...get ye hence,

16:07.211 --> 16:09.586
...the Lord will no more dwell among you.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.628
You will wander as orphans.

16:13.044 --> 16:16.628
But Lucifer did not triumph...

16:17.128 --> 16:20.711
...for the Lord is mighty and terrible...

16:21.003 --> 16:24.919
...and in his wrath
he poured his fury out like fire...

16:25.836 --> 16:27.628
...tormenting the wanton,

16:27.919 --> 16:31.961
...searing the flesh of those
who dwelled in iniquity.

16:32.544 --> 16:35.128
He led the wicked into darkness.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.211
Night after night she filled me...

16:37.544 --> 16:40.794
...with visions of the blood red hell
she longed for on earth.

16:41.419 --> 16:43.961
Until one night, boiling with measles,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.336
...I closed my eyes
and prayed to the Devil.

16:47.003 --> 16:48.461
"Dear Lucifer,

16:48.753 --> 16:51.961
...let her burn in hellfire
as you're burning me".

16:57.544 --> 16:59.211
Next day she took to her bed and died.

17:00.836 --> 17:04.877
He was a writer and so his descriptions
tended to be a little lurid.

17:06.086 --> 17:08.002
It would hardly get him arrested.

17:08.836 --> 17:10.461
But there were others.

17:11.919 --> 17:15.211
Unfortunately his delusions
were reinforced.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.419
It was a dreary
place with seedy hotels...

17:19.544 --> 17:23.336
...with names like "Atlantis" and
"Fairview" and "Welcome".

17:24.877 --> 17:27.252
And Mother was much like the hotels,

17:27.836 --> 17:31.003
...a decade past her prime, a lot of
paint covering the worst cracks...

17:31.128 --> 17:34.128
...a pathetic pretence at
being better than she was.

17:34.294 --> 17:37.418
John... make yourself
useful for a change...

17:37.419 --> 17:38.836
...and fetch my parasol.

17:39.086 --> 17:41.294
Father sported a moustache,
a blazer...

17:42.044 --> 17:43.378
...and the title "Major"v

17:43.711 --> 17:46.711
...acquired from a reserve regiment
when England's need was at its greatest.

17:48.169 --> 17:50.294
But he was no match for her.

17:53.919 --> 17:56.919
You scuff those shoes,
you'll go to school in slippers.

17:58.336 --> 18:01.419
My God, I don't know how we came
to have such a dreamer.

18:09.878 --> 18:12.336
Doesn't look like anything
as far as I can see,

18:12.836 --> 18:16.586
...with those fish eyes
and that stupid mouth, half open.

18:17.836 --> 18:19.419
I wouldn't mind if he saw things.

18:19.753 --> 18:21.378
You're too hard on him,

18:21.711 --> 18:24.586
...he's naturally introspective.

18:24.919 --> 18:27.461
Don't try and muddle me with long words,
Henry Morlar.

18:27.961 --> 18:29.211
He's a born fool...

18:29.461 --> 18:32.711
...and I know where he gets it from.
And that's a hereditary facts...

18:46.086 --> 18:48.503
Come away from there, you stupid little...

18:48.836 --> 18:51.919
- Henry, can't you control him?
- Get your hands off that.

18:52.711 --> 18:55.753
- Let him enjoy himself.
- Are you taking his side against me?

18:56.086 --> 18:57.878
Should I do everything myself?

18:58.211 --> 19:00.294
Serve the lunch, pack it away again.

19:01.461 --> 19:03.919
Ever since I had that child...

19:04.211 --> 19:06.253
John, get over here, help your mother.

20:26.586 --> 20:28.586
Had you played with the brakes?

20:29.086 --> 20:30.086
No.

20:30.836 --> 20:32.419
You didn't yell, you didn't warn them?

20:33.086 --> 20:35.461
When I saw them from that hotel window,
I knew it was...

20:35.961 --> 20:36.878
...inevitable.

20:39.669 --> 20:43.336
- Are you sure that isn't an excuse?
- A simplistic interpretation.

20:45.336 --> 20:47.336
If it were the only incident...

20:47.378 --> 20:48.711
...it might be valid.

20:49.003 --> 20:50.961
- There were others?
- Several.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.169
All equally inevitable.

20:57.336 --> 20:58.753
I felt them to be.

21:04.086 --> 21:07.503
He's carried that kind of conviction
right through his life?

21:08.919 --> 21:09.919
Tes.

21:12.753 --> 21:15.461
Yes, that's one way to describe it.

21:16.461 --> 21:19.044
Doctor, Mrs. Harrison's here to see you.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.586
I'm sorry, Inspector, I have a patient now.

21:21.919 --> 21:24.294
- If I can be of any further help...
- You can.

21:26.836 --> 21:29.086
I want to hear those other incidents.

21:30.794 --> 21:33.253
If he believed he was
involved in disasters...

21:33.544 --> 21:35.628
...he may have convinced
someone else too.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.253
And they sought revenge.

21:39.336 --> 21:43.169
I hardly think so.
Most people are very sane about delusions.

21:43.461 --> 21:46.061
It's only the deluded themselves
who take their stories seriously.

21:46.294 --> 21:49.044
I could come at 6, after you've finished.

21:50.044 --> 21:51.003
Tonight?

21:52.378 --> 21:56.419
There's a murderer or at least
an attempted murderer somewhere in London.

21:58.253 --> 21:59.919
And I would like to find him.

22:00.794 --> 22:02.711
I'm meeting someone for dinner.

22:05.003 --> 22:07.086
All right, Inspector, 6 o'clock.

22:07.378 --> 22:08.544
Thank you.

22:10.378 --> 22:13.586
Does "West Front" mean anything to you?

22:16.128 --> 22:18.628
He wrote it in his journal
next to your name.

22:20.669 --> 22:23.669
No, I don't know what that means.

22:24.419 --> 22:26.003
Thank you, Doctor.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.211
- Please, try to keep the corridor clear.
- Sorry.

22:38.878 --> 22:42.461
- Anything?
- No, sir, he's hardly alive.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.211
I've met a Doctor Johnson, is he here now?

22:46.503 --> 22:49.169
I think so, they're all pretty busy...

22:50.336 --> 22:53.044
...and a bit unhappy about the bed
being tied up.

22:53.586 --> 22:56.461
- It doesn't seem as though...
- Wait, there he is.

22:57.294 --> 23:01.336
We'll have to have more plasma.
Call Leeds and try to get McManus here.

23:02.836 --> 23:04.794
Give them the full list of casualties.

23:05.128 --> 23:07.878
Inspector Brunel,
what a pain in the derriere you're being.

23:08.211 --> 23:10.961
White, separate the children's figures,
that'll get McManus.

23:12.044 --> 23:16.128
It's a waste of time,
we can't really afford that apparatus.

23:16.711 --> 23:18.336
Waste of your time too.

23:19.003 --> 23:22.211
- If you could get one word from him.
- The jaw's off its hinges.

23:22.503 --> 23:25.003
He couldn't form a word if he was sensate.

23:25.294 --> 23:26.878
He could write one.

23:29.794 --> 23:31.211
See that?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.878
That's his pulse.

23:36.294 --> 23:37.753
Now look at that...

23:38.044 --> 23:41.378
...and you'll be watching a miracle.
That's the EEG, his brain.

23:42.544 --> 23:45.878
It shouldn't be working at all
after the way it's been smashed.

23:46.919 --> 23:48.169
Crazy.

23:48.419 --> 23:50.253
The brain's a power to itself.

23:51.003 --> 23:53.002
But I'm warning you, Brunel,
when that brain...

23:53.003 --> 23:55.103
...stops screaming,
I'll need that bed badly.

24:02.711 --> 24:05.669
Stay by him and keep
your pad and pencil ready.

24:06.044 --> 24:07.044
Yes, sir.

24:25.836 --> 24:29.461
It's all right, the Assistant Commissioner
wants a word with you.

24:36.294 --> 24:39.336
Your office said you were on the way
to his publishers, I just wanted a word.

24:39.753 --> 24:40.961
Your privilege.

24:41.503 --> 24:43.003
Morlar.

24:43.211 --> 24:45.753
- Are you on anything else?
- Yes, sir.

24:46.086 --> 24:48.503
- There was a knifing in Clapham Common.
- Drop it.

24:50.544 --> 24:52.503
We want to know who did it.

24:52.878 --> 24:54.169
So do I.

24:54.836 --> 24:58.253
I'm glad it fell to you.
We wouldn't dream of taking you off it.

24:59.211 --> 25:01.253
Why don't you go and chat
in Piccadilly Circus?

25:01.586 --> 25:03.419
You'd stop a bit more traffic there.

25:05.586 --> 25:07.211
Is there something I ought to know?

25:07.586 --> 25:10.586
No, just keep me informed.

25:15.128 --> 25:17.961
He was a brilliant writer
and his last few books were the best.

25:18.503 --> 25:22.794
- What were they about?
- Evil... and power.

25:23.086 --> 25:26.086
He had the gift for tying one to the other,
but nobody wanted to know.

25:26.378 --> 25:29.169
Copies always sold,
but somehow they never got reviewed.

25:30.086 --> 25:32.336
Could he have made enemies
with what he wrote?

25:32.628 --> 25:34.378
You'd better read him and see.

25:35.253 --> 25:38.336
Since no one paid very much attention,
I doubt they inspired murder.

25:39.794 --> 25:41.211
It's funny,

25:42.544 --> 25:45.919
...there was something about him,
very private,

25:46.211 --> 25:49.253
very intense, a little menacing.

25:49.586 --> 25:51.566
If I'm honest I'm not
surprised somebody...

25:51.567 --> 25:53.527
...tried to kill him,
but I couldn't tell you why.

25:53.669 --> 25:55.503
And his personal life?

25:56.669 --> 25:59.878
I'd be surprised if he had one,
he was so self absorbed.

26:00.794 --> 26:03.794
In all the times we met,
I can only remember one moment...

26:04.128 --> 26:06.128
...that didn't have to do with business.

26:06.503 --> 26:08.336
I've read your manuscript.

26:08.836 --> 26:10.753
It's very exciting.

26:11.628 --> 26:14.336
I love your satirical dissection
of the Prime Minister.

26:15.378 --> 26:18.253
But there's this other bit that worries me.

26:19.753 --> 26:23.753
- It's God who should...
- ...stand at the bar of public opinion.

26:24.503 --> 26:29.128
That almighty enemy of evil should face
a jury of his victims,

26:29.419 --> 26:32.878
...the helpless, the hopelessly
deformed, the despairing.

26:35.211 --> 26:36.878
It's a little strong.

26:37.169 --> 26:40.044
I'm not responsible
for what my characters say.

26:40.336 --> 26:43.544
Colby's despair entitles him
to taunt that celestial non-entity.

26:44.253 --> 26:47.003
But your readers won't see it that way,
they'll say it's you.

26:49.669 --> 26:53.711
I can live with that.
I've known despair too.

26:55.753 --> 26:58.461
As you say. There was this...

26:59.294 --> 27:01.294
Another section I wondered about.

27:01.628 --> 27:02.919
How incredible!

27:06.503 --> 27:07.503
John?

27:07.961 --> 27:10.044
Just a moment, I think we ought to...

27:11.628 --> 27:12.628
John?

27:36.169 --> 27:38.419
They sat there for over 3 hours.

27:39.419 --> 27:41.378
They were still there when I left at 6.

27:42.711 --> 27:44.961
Did you mention him the next time you met?

27:46.878 --> 27:50.211
No, you didn't intrude
where Morlar didn't want you to be.

27:50.878 --> 27:53.878
And the tramp, do you remember him?

27:54.169 --> 27:57.711
- Could you describe him?
- Not really.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.919
I'm slightly myopic...

28:02.003 --> 28:03.378
Thanks for your help.

28:03.669 --> 28:07.294
I'm sorry, it's just the only
personal anecdote I have.

28:21.711 --> 28:25.336
For the state he's in he must have
a bloody good reason to stay alive.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.211
I cannot live
alone with this knowledge.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.753
What is more, I cannot die with it.

28:34.794 --> 28:37.836
It's the terrible beauty of a cleft stick.

28:38.169 --> 28:41.294
Either end can beat you to death.

28:41.419 --> 28:44.586
God and gentle Jesus are
now the "in-thing".

28:45.419 --> 28:46.961
Mouth pious nothings...

28:47.044 --> 28:50.211
...and then grab the
biggest fee you can.

28:50.253 --> 28:52.044
No sign of L.

28:52.753 --> 28:56.378
The walls of Jericho fell
to the power of thought.

28:57.128 --> 28:59.669
So what is the meaning of impossibility?

29:01.711 --> 29:05.294
Zonfeld. If only she knew.

30:18.419 --> 30:19.961
You'll go blind, Inspector.

30:20.294 --> 30:22.854
We've been sifting through the tenants,
it's a blank draw so far.

30:23.128 --> 30:26.544
Only one woman ever spoke to him to get him
to join the Tenant's Association.

30:27.003 --> 30:28.643
Apparently he said:
"Don't bother me again with...

30:28.644 --> 30:30.643
...your middle-class crap"
and closed the door.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.336
I'm learning to admire the man
more and more.

30:35.628 --> 30:37.461
What, even his collection of pictures?

30:38.169 --> 30:41.711
Look at Medusa over there,
she's not very pretty, is she?

30:42.003 --> 30:44.794
She was a monster created
to do battle with the Gods.

30:45.086 --> 30:47.961
She's supposed to turn you to stone,
not look pretty.

30:48.586 --> 30:50.419
Come, I want to show you something.

30:50.753 --> 30:52.919
- What's the word from the hospital?
- The same.

30:53.336 --> 30:57.211
I would like an extra crew to check
the working tenants tonight.

30:57.461 --> 31:00.336
Anything suspicious: I want it on paper.

31:00.628 --> 31:02.461
Will they give us the personnel for that?

31:02.919 --> 31:04.128
They will.

31:04.628 --> 31:05.544
Look.

31:06.211 --> 31:08.503
Floods, tornadoes,

31:09.419 --> 31:11.961
...earthquakes, massacres,

31:13.128 --> 31:15.128
...riots,

31:16.836 --> 31:20.253
...killings, murders, air crashes,

31:21.294 --> 31:23.919
...famine... nothing but disaster.

31:24.878 --> 31:27.878
He has reams of them
going back across the years.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.544
- It's morbid.
- Maybe.

31:30.836 --> 31:34.196
But when you see them collected like this
you realise how much disaster we live with.

31:34.503 --> 31:35.878
How far did he get?

31:36.794 --> 31:40.794
The atom risk at Windscale,
The B.1. Bomber crash,

31:41.086 --> 31:43.044
...the American submarine.

31:43.294 --> 31:45.628
The last is the Jumbo business here.

31:46.711 --> 31:49.961
Pity, if he'd lived a little bit longer,
he could've pasted in the moon shot.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.294
There's no end to disaster, Sergeant Duff.

31:55.669 --> 31:58.503
Whenever he died,
there'd always be another.

31:58.794 --> 32:01.628
- So what's the point?
- I don't know.

32:03.086 --> 32:05.586
I thought you'd come up
with something brilliant.

32:06.711 --> 32:08.794
His death will be a disaster.

32:09.086 --> 32:11.336
Perhaps he wanted to get
into the book too.

32:12.794 --> 32:14.711
Not bad, perhaps.

32:16.294 --> 32:19.294
Get Rogers to send the rest
of the journals to my place.

32:19.794 --> 32:22.753
With those and his novels
I have a lot of reading to do.

32:23.586 --> 32:26.878
- How did It go with the psychiatrist?
- I'm seeing her again.

32:28.128 --> 32:29.086
Now.

32:29.378 --> 32:32.336
At least I'm getting an idea
of what the man was like.

32:33.169 --> 32:36.628
- Her?
- Yes, "her".

32:37.169 --> 32:38.919
Not your type...

32:40.794 --> 32:42.711
I want to be all the help I can to you,

32:43.044 --> 32:46.044
...but I've been through my notes on
Mr. Morlar and I can't find anything...

32:46.378 --> 32:49.044
...that would prompt someone to
assault him the way you suggest.

32:50.003 --> 32:53.336
And tonight is very important to me.

32:53.669 --> 32:55.336
I will be brief.

32:56.086 --> 32:58.961
Do you know who "L" might be?

32:59.253 --> 33:03.253
In his journal he has written:
"No sign of L".

33:04.003 --> 33:05.628
Does that mean anything to you?

33:07.003 --> 33:08.961
No, he never referred to anyone that way.

33:09.294 --> 33:11.253
He seems fixated on disasters.

33:11.544 --> 33:14.711
Could any of the other incidents Morlar
felt responsible for...

33:15.003 --> 33:16.836
...be called disasters?

33:18.128 --> 33:21.419
One of them could be described that way.

33:21.753 --> 33:24.836
- Were there any deaths involved?
- Yes, a few.

33:26.086 --> 33:27.628
A few.

33:32.336 --> 33:34.419
Was Morlar blamed for any of them?

33:35.419 --> 33:37.419
Yes, he was under suspicion.

33:40.503 --> 33:42.503
May I take my coat off?

33:51.253 --> 33:52.169
Parsons.

33:52.669 --> 33:54.711
Since your first name is Walter...

33:55.044 --> 33:57.336
...and your father is allegedly
an expert in finance,

33:57.586 --> 33:59.503
...perhaps you'd care to contribute.

33:59.711 --> 34:00.711
Yes, sir...

34:01.878 --> 34:02.878
...that is...

34:03.503 --> 34:05.211
The F-F-First Crusade in...

34:06.919 --> 34:08.793
I have given you a clue.

34:09.168 --> 34:11.460
As the exquisite torture went on,

34:11.793 --> 34:15.003
...I chose to watch
the scarlet leaves...

34:15.293 --> 34:17.668
...being tossed by the grey gusts
of the autumn wind.

34:18.003 --> 34:20.128
I took myself out of the arena.

34:20.168 --> 34:21.168
...was led...

34:21.628 --> 34:24.628
...by Walter the penniless... and...

34:27.003 --> 34:30.710
Sit down, for God's sake,
you make me quite ill with your retchings.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.543
Retention of the facts, that is...

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
Morlar.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.460
Morlar.

34:42.753 --> 34:43.753
Sir?

34:44.085 --> 34:47.128
Can we assume that you are with us
in body if not in spirit?

34:48.043 --> 34:49.003
Yes, sir.

34:49.878 --> 34:53.753
- And what is that supposed to mean?
- That your assumption is correct, sir.

34:54.043 --> 34:56.043
I was watching the leaves.

34:58.128 --> 34:59.753
Get to your feet.

35:00.878 --> 35:03.128
Are you deliberately trying
to make a fool of me?

35:03.836 --> 35:07.253
I'm sure one can only make
a fool of himself, Mr. Copley.

35:08.919 --> 35:09.836
Silence!

35:10.544 --> 35:12.294
Very interesting.

35:12.586 --> 35:16.711
It appears we have a philosopher in
our midst watching the leaves.

35:17.378 --> 35:19.836
I'll assist you in your philosophic bent.

35:20.336 --> 35:22.378
After chapel you'll go out
into the grounds...

35:22.669 --> 35:25.544
...and you will pick up
exactly 1149 leaves,

35:25.836 --> 35:27.419
...which number, as you know,

35:27.753 --> 35:30.336
...is the terminating date
of the Second Crusade.

35:30.961 --> 35:31.961
Yes, sir.

35:32.169 --> 35:34.086
Then you'll bring those leaves to
my study and we will count them...

35:34.169 --> 35:37.544
...and if I find one leaf more or less,
I will thrash you, Morlar.

35:37.836 --> 35:41.669
I will thrash you so that you'll remember
it for the rest of your misbegotten life.

36:00.253 --> 36:01.836
Out of my way, boy!

36:10.878 --> 36:11.710
Well?

36:11.711 --> 36:15.086
Your leaves, sir... 1149.

36:16.878 --> 36:18.669
This won't do, Morlar.

36:18.961 --> 36:20.544
These leaves are wet,

36:20.878 --> 36:23.711
...I can't have them soiling my carpet.

36:24.044 --> 36:27.169
- Go and dry them.
- Yes, sir.

36:36.044 --> 36:37.878
How dare you look at me like that?

36:38.461 --> 36:39.378
Get out.

36:42.128 --> 36:43.461
Get out!

37:29.794 --> 37:31.794
One master and 4 boys...

37:32.086 --> 37:33.711
...died in the fire.

37:35.044 --> 37:37.084
- The master was the one who
had made him...? - Yes.

37:37.378 --> 37:40.961
At the inquest the whole story came out.
He admitted he left the furnace door open.

37:41.253 --> 37:43.336
That was seen as the cause of the fire.

37:44.086 --> 37:46.044
No one believed it was deliberate.

37:46.378 --> 37:49.628
- He was exonerated of all blame.
- Even by the parents of the boys?

37:51.378 --> 37:52.503
I don't know.

37:55.878 --> 37:58.253
You've given me my first lead.

37:58.544 --> 38:01.794
- I'm grateful.
- I'm glad I could be of some help.

38:02.086 --> 38:03.419
What did Morlar feel about it?

38:05.086 --> 38:08.294
When I looked at Copley in the doorway,
I knew he was going to die.

38:10.878 --> 38:12.503
What about the 4 boys?

38:14.294 --> 38:16.169
They're one of the reasons I'm here.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.961
- Did you set fire to the building?
- I didn't set fire to my school.

38:20.253 --> 38:22.503
I did not touch the brakes my father's car.

38:24.753 --> 38:25.669
Therefore?

38:26.253 --> 38:28.294
Therefore there must be something else.

38:30.044 --> 38:31.711
Was there something else?

38:34.336 --> 38:37.211
What else could there be?

38:43.086 --> 38:45.586
That's right, the south of Kent.

38:48.086 --> 38:51.128
I would like you to get the names
of the boys who died.

38:51.378 --> 38:52.378
Yes, yes...

38:53.128 --> 38:55.711
And then I would like a
biography of their families.

38:56.294 --> 38:58.586
Who's living, what they're doing, where...

39:01.503 --> 39:03.503
I know, it's late, Sergeant.

39:05.003 --> 39:08.211
May I suggest you start
tomorrow morning, early.

39:22.669 --> 39:24.294
L today.

39:25.253 --> 39:26.794
They blast off tomorrow.

39:28.086 --> 39:29.836
One of them said:

39:30.086 --> 39:32.628
"I'm just an ordinary fella doing a job"

39:32.919 --> 39:34.878
...and other finger-licking nausea.

39:35.169 --> 39:38.544
They are worried about cracks
in the West Front.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.336
We shall see.

39:42.128 --> 39:43.086
Corning.

39:45.169 --> 39:46.128
Telekinesis.

39:47.711 --> 39:48.711
Yes.

39:53.711 --> 39:55.503
Sergeant Duff, come in.

39:57.961 --> 39:59.919
I think I have found something.

40:00.419 --> 40:01.878
So have I.

40:05.461 --> 40:08.378
Two of the neighbours say
Pennington felt...

40:08.669 --> 40:11.628
...Morlar was responsible
for his wife's death.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.669
- How did she die?
- Apparently a suicide.

40:19.753 --> 40:23.628
Morlar did have the habit of making
himself responsible for such things.

40:24.669 --> 40:26.378
But that one, Pennington...

40:27.336 --> 40:29.336
...would he have the nerve to kill?

40:29.378 --> 40:30.669
Mm, I don't know.

40:30.753 --> 40:33.294
Maybe if you loved your wife enough.

40:33.961 --> 40:36.919
Neighbours. People should mind
their own business.

40:37.544 --> 40:40.544
- They were trying to help.
- They weren't trying to help me.

40:41.336 --> 40:43.628
I hated him, I never tried to kill him.

40:43.919 --> 40:46.544
Of course not, but the
more we learn about him,

40:46.836 --> 40:48.878
...the easier it will be to
find who did it.

40:49.169 --> 40:52.044
He'd deserve to get away with it.

40:52.086 --> 40:53.294
He would.

40:53.503 --> 40:55.503
You ever see Morlar's eyes?

40:55.836 --> 40:57.836
A man can't be done in because of his eyes.

40:58.128 --> 41:01.711
Maybe some should. The Church says
there demons in some people.

41:02.044 --> 41:03.503
And there are.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.586
My Grace would be alive today,
if it hadn't been for him.

41:08.253 --> 41:11.669
- He killed her?
- He didn't take a gun to her.

41:12.419 --> 41:14.544
There are more ways than
one of killing a cat.

41:16.461 --> 41:18.461
What exactly did he do, Mr. Pennington?

41:20.044 --> 41:22.003
It was because of the fish.

41:23.669 --> 41:24.836
Fish?

41:26.169 --> 41:27.211
Fish.

41:27.378 --> 41:28.419
Look at it it's rotten.
How can you pay...

41:28.420 --> 41:31.419
...money for something that's
diseased and rotten like that.

41:31.711 --> 41:33.586
I looked it over carefully.

41:33.836 --> 41:35.836
It's not rotten, it's the light in here.

41:36.086 --> 41:38.461
The light has nothing to do with it.

41:38.753 --> 41:42.628
It is bad, foul. Look at that colour,
it's... Oh, it's disgusting!

41:42.919 --> 41:44.961
It's dead, all fish look
like that when they're dead.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.961
I'd like to know what that fish died of.

41:47.253 --> 41:50.211
It's probably full of mercury and lead
and every poison in the sea.

41:51.169 --> 41:55.211
It died like any other fish.
I'll make a little parsley sauce.

41:55.503 --> 41:57.961
If you want to poison me,
don't try to disguise it.

41:58.294 --> 42:00.294
I'm not trying to poison you,

42:00.295 --> 42:02.415
...it's a perfectly good fish.
The fishmonger won't...

42:02.753 --> 42:06.669
Mr Miller? He sees
you coming, you fool.

42:07.419 --> 42:09.003
I won't eat it...

42:09.253 --> 42:11.253
...until you eat it first.

42:12.086 --> 42:13.169
All right.

42:13.419 --> 42:16.836
For heaven's sake, stop panicking,
we'll eat something else.

42:17.169 --> 42:19.169
I planned this meal all day...

42:19.461 --> 42:21.336
...and you bring something
full of infection.

42:21.628 --> 42:24.003
I don't know how I can go on.

42:24.336 --> 42:25.878
Keep your voice down.

42:26.961 --> 42:30.253
How can I, when the television's
screaming all the time?

42:30.586 --> 42:32.961
You worry more about the neighbours
than about me.

42:33.211 --> 42:36.461
I don't. I've wrapped the bloody fish up
and thrown it away.

42:36.794 --> 42:39.169
Now, please, take a pill and calm down.

42:39.461 --> 42:41.336
Take a pill.

42:41.586 --> 42:43.919
God, you and that doctor!

42:44.253 --> 42:47.836
I just don't know why I go on,
I just don't know why.

42:48.128 --> 42:50.961
I'll open a tin of ravioli,
it'll be all right.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.753
God! I'd rather die.

42:54.586 --> 42:56.669
I'd rather get it over
with before you kill me.

42:56.961 --> 43:00.336
- Stop talking like that.
- You wouldn't care, nobody cares.

43:00.628 --> 43:04.003
- I've a good mind to jump.
- For God's sake woman, jump.

43:20.378 --> 43:21.753
Grace?

43:30.003 --> 43:31.336
Grace?

43:40.919 --> 43:43.919
- Was Morlar always a writer?
- No, he began as a lawyer.

43:44.836 --> 43:46.086
Poor devil.

43:46.378 --> 43:49.178
I glance through the paper every day
to see whether he's still with us.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.628
- A medical wonder, they say.
- He has a great will to survive.

43:52.961 --> 43:55.878
There we are, life and death,
damn funny things.

43:57.086 --> 43:58.836
What do I know about him?

43:59.419 --> 44:01.711
He was my junior for a time.

44:02.836 --> 44:06.919
Just another ordinary young hack but
trying to make his way to an odd guinea.

44:08.794 --> 44:11.794
Never had a great deal to do with him,
little in common.

44:13.003 --> 44:14.294
Not even the law.

44:14.586 --> 44:17.169
Heart wasn't in it
and that's death in any profession.

44:18.128 --> 44:22.128
He married, not wisely,
but too well connected,

44:22.419 --> 44:24.128
...that probably didn't help.

44:26.919 --> 44:28.919
What kind of person was he?

44:29.503 --> 44:31.253
Very withdrawn sort of fellow.

44:32.211 --> 44:34.128
Had the most disconcerting eyes.

44:34.419 --> 44:37.294
One could never return his gaze
in conversation.

44:37.628 --> 44:39.461
Somehow made one feel guilty.

44:41.086 --> 44:43.086
Do you know why he left the law?

44:44.544 --> 44:47.961
I thought you knew,
thought that's why you'd come.

44:48.294 --> 44:49.961
No, I didn't know.

44:53.086 --> 44:55.794
Mr. Morlar, may I suggest you be brief?

44:56.086 --> 44:59.486
Barristers' first windings-up tend to be
rather more generous with the Court's time...

44:59.711 --> 45:01.669
...than is strictly necessary.

45:07.461 --> 45:11.503
The chief villainy
of Mr. Lovelass's pamphlet...

45:11.878 --> 45:14.919
...lies in his open admission
that he would do what he could...

45:15.253 --> 45:17.253
...to make a world saner...

45:17.919 --> 45:20.544
...and more humane than
the world we live in.

45:21.544 --> 45:23.253
His phrase, not mine.

45:23.586 --> 45:25.294
He made curbside speeches.

45:25.628 --> 45:29.044
He even wrote to certain politicians
and so-called princes of the church.

45:29.086 --> 45:31.086
Mr Molar. Could you bring
us to the charges?

45:31.878 --> 45:32.836
My Lord,

45:33.128 --> 45:35.794
...the prosecution makes much...

45:37.044 --> 45:40.878
...of the Defendant's professed wish to
see the Imperial War Museum destroyed.

45:41.794 --> 45:44.961
"Why", the Defendant asks,
"do we send bus-loads of children...

45:45.294 --> 45:48.086
...to gawk at that collection of tributes
to authorised murder?"

45:48.378 --> 45:49.711
A crime?

45:51.378 --> 45:53.711
Look at this venerable courtroom.

45:54.253 --> 45:56.336
We are supposed to be civilised,

45:57.003 --> 45:59.753
...yet we do shove innocents
into that chamber of horrors,

46:00.086 --> 46:02.544
...stuffed with pain, mutilation
and death and say:

46:02.836 --> 46:05.419
"Look, children. This is what
put the Great in Britain".

46:06.044 --> 46:08.669
But where in that asylum of grotesques...

46:08.961 --> 46:12.086
...do we find framed the armament
manufacturer's cheque book,

46:12.419 --> 46:16.419
...together with Grandpa's piss-pathetic
medal and his artificial leg?

46:16.961 --> 46:18.461
I am with the Defendant.

46:18.794 --> 46:22.211
If I knew how,
I would blow the bloody place sky high.

46:22.461 --> 46:25.961
For which thought, if memory serves,
the Prosecution argues,

46:26.253 --> 46:28.461
...if a man can be so scathing...

46:28.753 --> 46:31.419
...about our bloodied militaristic past,

46:31.711 --> 46:33.294
...what is he not capable of?

46:33.794 --> 46:36.544
I will tell you,
ladies and gentlemen of the Jury.

46:37.294 --> 46:39.169
He is not capable of a non-event.

46:39.503 --> 46:42.169
There was no bomb, no threats,
no conspiracy.

46:42.419 --> 46:44.919
You know it, the Prosecution knows it,
I know it,

46:45.211 --> 46:47.044
...the Judge knows it.

46:48.086 --> 46:50.628
It is not the Defendant
who should be on trial here,

46:51.169 --> 46:53.044
...but a besotted establishment...

46:53.586 --> 46:55.746
...who can cheerfully send
a generation to slaughter...

46:55.878 --> 46:59.211
...in the name of war
and yet has the audacity to bring...

46:59.544 --> 47:02.461
...a hapless fool like Lovelass
to trial for uttering...

47:02.753 --> 47:04.378
...words.

47:06.169 --> 47:09.628
There was no crime,
therefore there can be no sentence.

47:11.294 --> 47:12.878
My Lord.

47:14.419 --> 47:16.169
Some good points of course,

47:16.461 --> 47:20.003
...but McKinley was the wrong man
to give them to, especially in that way.

47:20.919 --> 47:22.836
He instructed the Jury.
Got a verdict...

47:23.128 --> 47:24.711
...and passed sentence.

47:27.086 --> 47:31.003
It is plain that you deliberately sought
to attack the law with violence.

47:31.711 --> 47:35.003
The only fit punishment
is to remove you from society.

47:35.628 --> 47:37.211
I sentence you...

47:37.503 --> 47:40.086
...to a period of imprisonment of 9 years.

47:44.336 --> 47:45.711
Take him away.

48:05.044 --> 48:06.669
May I guess what happened next?

48:07.878 --> 48:11.586
As Morlar stared at him,
the Judge grew pale.

48:12.961 --> 48:15.169
Exactly, on the nail.

48:15.919 --> 48:19.086
Later something happened to him.

48:20.253 --> 48:22.461
In his chambers, an hour after the trial,

48:24.211 --> 48:25.711
...died of a heart attack.

48:26.169 --> 48:28.169
The Coroner asked if
there was anything...

48:28.419 --> 48:30.544
...to account for the look
of terror on his face.

48:37.961 --> 48:41.961
- What's on your mind, Inspector?
- It's what's on that mind that worries me.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.336
I've honestly never
seen anything like it.

48:46.253 --> 48:48.003
It seems to be struggling harder.

48:50.253 --> 48:52.044
I have been reading his journals,

48:52.336 --> 48:54.503
...he talks about telekinesis.

48:55.669 --> 48:57.753
Fairy stories or anything to it?

48:58.086 --> 49:00.753
The power of thought to influence matter.

49:01.794 --> 49:05.378
The Americans have done a lot of
research, the Russians too.

49:07.128 --> 49:11.169
They have a girl who can apparently
think a chair across a room.

49:11.711 --> 49:16.044
In America there's a man who can think
pictures onto film through a lead plate.

49:17.378 --> 49:20.003
All I know is, our ignorance is so great,

49:20.044 --> 49:21.794
...I keep an open mind.

50:33.919 --> 50:35.919
Well, Inspector...
We have traced these...

50:35.920 --> 50:38.419
...experiments in telekinesis
and mental powers.

50:40.711 --> 50:42.669
The first one is fairly familiar,

50:43.169 --> 50:46.044
...it demonstrates the power
of the mind to dominate pain.

50:46.919 --> 50:50.669
It's in the tradition of lying on
spikes and walking on hot coals.

50:51.294 --> 50:53.919
This second experiment
is more interesting.

50:56.294 --> 50:59.294
The boy's head is
linked to a scoreboard.

51:00.503 --> 51:02.419
The power of his thoughts...

51:02.669 --> 51:04.586
...can turn on lights and ring bells.

51:17.044 --> 51:20.711
This film is one of the most famous
of telekinetic demonstrations.

51:21.794 --> 51:25.794
Kulagina is just a Leningrad
housewife and grandmother.

51:26.836 --> 51:28.919
Over 40 high ranking scientists...

51:29.253 --> 51:31.836
...examined her for hidden magnets,

51:32.128 --> 51:33.961
...wires and other artificial aids.

51:34.294 --> 51:36.169
There were none.

51:37.836 --> 51:41.878
They could give no explanation
of her powers to move objects.

51:58.961 --> 52:00.961
Lastly and the most dramatic.

52:03.044 --> 52:11.044
This young history teacher is going to try
to will this pane of glass to shatter.

52:30.044 --> 52:31.628
To build a cenotaph,

52:32.169 --> 52:34.336
...first choose a million victims.

52:37.336 --> 52:40.753
You know, Duff, I'm beginning to wonder
what we're chasing,

52:41.378 --> 52:43.044
...victim or murderer?

52:43.419 --> 52:45.211
It's a string of coincidences.

52:45.503 --> 52:48.836
I can see how it gave the bloke nightmares,
but every single one is explainable.

52:50.211 --> 52:53.919
- What do you think he wants?
- Conclusions.

52:55.086 --> 52:57.294
To tell me I have 2 months
left in England...

52:58.544 --> 53:01.586
...and I'm wasting too much time
on a man who isn't even dead.

53:04.086 --> 53:06.128
Meanwhile let's find Lovelass.

53:12.086 --> 53:13.669
Morning, sir.

53:14.461 --> 53:15.878
Ah, bonjour.

53:16.711 --> 53:19.544
- Morlar still alive?
- Yes, sir.

53:19.836 --> 53:21.169
Everything going all right?

53:21.711 --> 53:24.503
I think the expression is,
it belongs in a book.

53:25.878 --> 53:27.628
I've read your reports.

53:27.961 --> 53:30.753
This Zonfeld, is he reliable?

53:31.086 --> 53:32.628
He's a her,

53:33.586 --> 53:35.419
...and everything has checked so far.

53:36.294 --> 53:40.336
Some interested parties want his journals.

53:41.044 --> 53:42.003
Who?

53:44.128 --> 53:46.794
Oh, come - you have
interested parties, too.

53:47.961 --> 53:48.919
Why?

53:50.003 --> 53:51.836
They don't have to say why.

53:54.086 --> 53:58.128
- He wrote books.
- Is that against the law in England?

53:58.836 --> 54:02.544
Not yet. We've got enough trouble
without a dozen Watergates to handle.

54:03.544 --> 54:06.586
Morlar knew too much
about those corridors of power,

54:06.878 --> 54:09.159
...what goes on behind the wainscoting,
under the carpets.

54:09.378 --> 54:11.253
God knows how he ever learnt but he did.

54:11.586 --> 54:15.253
The books were bad enough, they want to see
what's going on in those journals.

54:17.086 --> 54:21.169
You've given me
an interesting set of new suspects.

54:22.628 --> 54:25.253
That's not their way, they're too subtle.

54:25.544 --> 54:28.044
It was personal hatred that got Morlar.

54:28.586 --> 54:31.211
Remember, I've been a detective too.

54:31.753 --> 54:33.628
That's why you know I want those journals.

54:35.503 --> 54:36.961
Taxi.

54:37.211 --> 54:38.919
I tell you one thing,

54:39.211 --> 54:41.503
...lots of people will be relieved
to know who did it.

54:42.169 --> 54:44.378
Not as many, apparently,
as wished him dead.

54:47.336 --> 54:49.753
No, Morlar didn't profess to use hypnosis.

54:50.253 --> 54:54.169
And you can't cause a school to burn
or a car to move with hypnosis.

54:55.711 --> 54:58.169
He talks in his journals
about telekinesis.

55:00.086 --> 55:01.711
A very disputed field.

55:02.003 --> 55:05.378
But it's hard to believe he could
give measles to his nanny in that way,

55:05.711 --> 55:08.711
...or induce a heart attack
on Judge McKinley.

55:10.211 --> 55:11.711
No.

55:12.003 --> 55:14.086
He told you about McKinley?

55:15.336 --> 55:16.419
Well, yes.

55:16.503 --> 55:18.711
And his neighbour, Mrs. Pennington?

55:18.753 --> 55:20.211
Yes.

55:21.294 --> 55:24.836
You sound a little like you're becoming
a victim of Morlar's own thinking.

55:28.419 --> 55:31.294
It is a remarkable chain of coincidence.

55:32.378 --> 55:33.336
Remarkable.

55:33.753 --> 55:35.753
It's not coincidence, it's me.

55:36.086 --> 55:37.628
It seems like you,

55:37.919 --> 55:40.753
...but when we understand more about you,
perhaps we'll know why.

55:41.044 --> 55:42.628
Don't patronise me.

55:42.919 --> 55:46.836
You drag people out of hell
and yet you refuse to recognise the devil.

55:49.378 --> 55:53.003
If I believed in possession,
I'd be a witch doctor.

55:53.253 --> 55:54.628
You're clever,

55:54.961 --> 55:57.878
...they told me you'd be clever,
that's why I came.

55:58.586 --> 56:00.836
But don't talk to me of coincidence.

56:04.753 --> 56:08.044
My wife and I had a baby,

56:09.544 --> 56:12.128
...it was born deformed, withered.

56:12.753 --> 56:16.461
It lived for an hour and when it died
the hospital breathed a sigh of relief.

56:18.003 --> 56:20.878
If you say coincidence to me,
I will drive my fist through your face.

56:26.544 --> 56:28.461
All right, I'm not possessed.

56:28.711 --> 56:30.961
I don't believe in the
devil any more than you,

56:31.294 --> 56:33.919
...any more than I believe in God.
But what is it?

56:35.211 --> 56:37.169
Do you know what I did when I saw the baby?

56:37.961 --> 56:39.544
I'd wanted that child.

56:40.419 --> 56:43.544
It was the only thing I had wanted
from my marriage.

56:45.711 --> 56:49.586
When I looked at it,
all these coincidences seemed too much.

56:51.294 --> 56:53.544
I was afraid, to tell anyone.

56:55.753 --> 56:59.461
So I went to the one place
where people who are afraid can go.

57:01.044 --> 57:02.669
Come in, Mr. Morlar.

57:03.878 --> 57:07.169
It is Morlar, is it?
Come in.

57:07.461 --> 57:14.419
It's a little dim in here,
but most of my clients expect it.

57:14.669 --> 57:18.336
The truth is we're nearer the Dark Ages
than we care to admit.

57:19.794 --> 57:23.086
Sit down by the table, don't be nervous.

57:25.669 --> 57:27.253
I have a very varied clientele.

57:28.003 --> 57:29.794
Young girls who are pregnant,

57:30.461 --> 57:33.878
...stockbrokers whose
businesses are failing,

57:35.211 --> 57:37.378
...Middle-aged ladies in love
with their hairdressers.

57:39.086 --> 57:41.669
We all need to know our destiny.

57:42.794 --> 57:44.503
Now is it...

57:44.669 --> 57:47.919
Just a simple reading you require, or...

57:52.503 --> 57:54.378
Just a simple reading.

57:56.128 --> 57:57.753
Is something wrong?

57:59.669 --> 58:03.544
No... no, it's...

58:03.878 --> 58:05.836
A simple reading will be fine.

58:09.503 --> 58:11.878
Your hand, please, left hand.

58:18.669 --> 58:20.419
Oh, no...

58:22.378 --> 58:24.378
There's been a recent tragedy...

58:25.044 --> 58:26.461
Yes.

58:28.128 --> 58:30.294
This...

58:32.086 --> 58:33.836
I...

58:37.044 --> 58:38.878
I...

58:41.419 --> 58:42.836
I... I...

58:43.003 --> 58:45.961
I'm sorry, I'm not feeling...

58:47.753 --> 58:49.586
I'm not...

58:53.878 --> 58:55.086
I suggest...

58:56.836 --> 59:00.169
...that you go elsewhere.

59:09.794 --> 59:11.753
Coincidence?

59:12.711 --> 59:16.003
Palmistry, I'm surprised at you.

59:17.461 --> 59:19.461
Let's say you are possessed,

59:20.003 --> 59:22.003
...where do we go from here,
the Church?

59:24.669 --> 59:26.211
I'm sorry.

59:27.503 --> 59:29.628
Perhaps it would be better
if we understood...

59:29.919 --> 59:32.378
...why the child was all you
wanted from your marriage.

59:34.336 --> 59:37.128
If you had met my wife that would be
totally understandable.

59:37.628 --> 59:40.128
It's the first time
you mention your marriage.

59:40.878 --> 59:46.378
We're separated, the one time in my life
when I almost felt pleasure at what I am.

01:00:05.711 --> 01:00:07.128
There you are.

01:00:07.378 --> 01:00:10.336
Yes, here I am.

01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:17.586
Don't I look ravishing?

01:00:18.461 --> 01:00:19.878
Ravishing.

01:00:20.003 --> 01:00:22.003
What's the occasion? A traffic accident?

01:00:23.003 --> 01:00:25.003
I am going to the theatre with Edward.

01:00:25.961 --> 01:00:29.544
Edward Parrish,
I'm sure you recognise the face.

01:00:29.878 --> 01:00:31.378
Vaguely.

01:00:33.336 --> 01:00:35.419
Isn't he the peculiar fellow...

01:00:35.711 --> 01:00:38.253
...who played Jesus with a wig once?

01:00:40.044 --> 01:00:41.711
No, it couldn't be,

01:00:42.419 --> 01:00:44.086
...adultery wouldn't be his game.

01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:47.961
Do you mind?

01:00:48.211 --> 01:00:51.586
Go right ahead,
I think you may need the drink.

01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:57.003
He isn't going to perform for us, is he?

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.294
No, but I see you are.

01:01:00.419 --> 01:01:04.461
We're performers all, aren't we? Me,
the dutiful husband, you, the loving wife.

01:01:05.419 --> 01:01:07.544
I can see what Patricia means.

01:01:08.628 --> 01:01:10.628
You really don't deserve her.

01:01:11.086 --> 01:01:12.711
Nobody deserves Patricia.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:15.461
She was invented by God
to test our belief in Him.

01:01:16.336 --> 01:01:20.044
She is a girl of extraordinary
sensitivity and talent.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:23.003
Patricia was never a girl,
little Jesus.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:26.003
Childhood has to do with
innocence, and roses...

01:01:26.044 --> 01:01:30.628
...her gift is for prussic acid
and flying on broom sticks.

01:01:30.836 --> 01:01:34.128
How did she ever come to choose you?

01:01:34.919 --> 01:01:35.878
Divination.

01:01:37.003 --> 01:01:40.961
I suppose daddy's going to finance
your next escapade on film.

01:01:44.253 --> 01:01:45.753
I want to marry her.

01:01:46.211 --> 01:01:47.878
He's offered that much!

01:01:48.294 --> 01:01:49.503
You bastard!

01:01:49.794 --> 01:01:53.753
- It was you who wanted to get married.
- I mistook you for a woman.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:57.419
You really are as foul as she says.

01:01:58.794 --> 01:02:00.461
I have a gift for speaking the truth,

01:02:00.753 --> 01:02:03.753
...it leaves a strange stench in her
nostrils, something you have in common.

01:02:05.628 --> 01:02:08.378
You go too far, dear boy.

01:02:08.711 --> 01:02:10.336
I doubt it.

01:02:11.419 --> 01:02:14.378
There's only one issue,
are you prepared to let her go?

01:02:15.044 --> 01:02:16.878
Let her go?

01:02:17.419 --> 01:02:19.753
My dear fellow,
if I weren't a faintly...

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.753
...interested party,
I'd appear for you myself.

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:29.544
To the happiest day of our marriage.

01:02:29.586 --> 01:02:31.878
Yes. Yes it is.

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:33.544
Daddy was right.

01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:36.711
You aren't capable of
producing anything...

01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:38.711
...but a vegetable.

01:02:42.544 --> 01:02:44.169
Patricia.

01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:54.211
Goodbye, my dear husband.
Don't expect me back.

01:02:56.794 --> 01:02:57.753
I won't.

01:03:06.753 --> 01:03:08.586
You know the rest.

01:03:10.961 --> 01:03:14.044
An hour later an artificially sympathetic
policeman told me that my wife...

01:03:14.378 --> 01:03:16.836
...and an unidentified male companion...

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:19.586
...had been killed in a car
crash on Baywater Road.

01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:24.544
I can see how, after your baby's death...

01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:26.669
I made it happen.

01:03:29.628 --> 01:03:32.503
It wasn't like the others where
I knew it would happen.

01:03:35.544 --> 01:03:36.711
I made it happen.

01:03:39.294 --> 01:03:42.419
Perhaps you wanted it to happen
more than the others,

01:03:43.461 --> 01:03:45.669
...but you couldn't cause
an accident miles away.

01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:49.003
You wanted it badly,
that's what we must concentrate on.

01:03:49.919 --> 01:03:51.919
I made that accident happen.

01:03:57.294 --> 01:03:59.919
Inspector, your thinking
has come round to his.

01:04:04.461 --> 01:04:06.919
You've given me another suspect to chase,

01:04:07.628 --> 01:04:09.211
...her father.

01:04:09.586 --> 01:04:12.919
But I confess if I were Morlar,
I would be coming to see you too.

01:04:15.294 --> 01:04:18.044
Were you able to help him at all?

01:04:18.544 --> 01:04:21.544
Oh, that was the last time I saw Mr Morlar.

01:04:23.669 --> 01:04:25.586
He never returned to my office.

01:04:31.794 --> 01:04:33.044
That's all?

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.878
I'm sorry we won't have to meet again,

01:04:38.794 --> 01:04:41.419
...but that is all I have to
tell you about Mr. Morlar.

01:04:43.628 --> 01:04:45.253
Thank you, Doctor.

01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:03.044
When all is said and done, Zonfeld
is no more than a witch doctor...

01:05:03.086 --> 01:05:05.961
...who conditions doubters
to accept the dung heap.

01:05:07.211 --> 01:05:10.253
"Doctor the planes are
keeping me awake at night",

01:05:10.503 --> 01:05:13.919
..."screaming over my head,
hour after hour".

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.753
"Delusions my dear friend".

01:05:17.211 --> 01:05:19.669
"Doctor my skin's black and I
keep thinking I'm different".

01:05:20.003 --> 01:05:21.378
"Delusions might be a problem".

01:05:24.003 --> 01:05:27.253
"Doctor when I get behind a wheel,
I have an insane urge to kill".

01:05:28.128 --> 01:05:31.586
"Delusions, my dear friend,
delusions, delusions, delusions".

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:43.878
Like a ride, Inspector?

01:05:47.169 --> 01:05:48.836
English humour?

01:05:54.544 --> 01:05:56.919
You're wanted at the
hospital, I don't know why.

01:05:58.044 --> 01:06:00.836
No more deaths from the Jumbo crash,
everything's back to normal.

01:06:01.169 --> 01:06:03.378
The long-hairs are planning
a protest march...

01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.628
...on the Atomic Energy Plant
at Windscale.

01:06:05.919 --> 01:06:08.378
- The dear old British pound is falling...
- Stop the car!

01:06:17.503 --> 01:06:20.294
Inspector Brunel, wait,
please, you can't...

01:06:20.461 --> 01:06:21.461
Inspector.

01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:24.461
I'm sorry, but you're coming
to the hospital with me.

01:06:24.753 --> 01:06:27.544
- I have a patient due in!
- The patient will wait.

01:06:28.336 --> 01:06:30.544
I want you to come to the hospital now.

01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:48.753
I'm not sure why I called.

01:06:50.003 --> 01:06:52.794
Perhaps I just needed someone
to share my astonishment.

01:06:56.253 --> 01:06:59.003
Somewhere deep within
what's left of that brain...

01:07:00.294 --> 01:07:01.919
...something is going on.

01:07:02.628 --> 01:07:04.753
It's grown stronger almost every hour.

01:07:10.086 --> 01:07:11.378
Is he recovering?

01:07:11.669 --> 01:07:14.711
We've kept the respirator going,
we've tried to stimulate the heart,

01:07:15.169 --> 01:07:17.919
...but if it weren't for that, nothing.

01:07:21.586 --> 01:07:25.044
- How can that be?
- The brain is complicated.

01:07:25.461 --> 01:07:26.836
Ask her.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:29.794
It begins in blood and flesh...

01:07:30.086 --> 01:07:33.628
...and ends in incomprehensible
tangles of fear, dreams, love...

01:07:35.003 --> 01:07:35.961
...Will.

01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:39.003
That's the ordinary brain,
never mind that one.

01:07:39.461 --> 01:07:41.086
All I can tell you is...

01:07:41.544 --> 01:07:44.544
...you're looking at a mind
determined not to die.

01:07:45.753 --> 01:07:46.836
But why?

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:49.503
Is there something he's trying to tell us?

01:07:49.669 --> 01:07:51.044
Maybe.

01:07:51.419 --> 01:07:53.753
Maybe he forgot to turn off the gas.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:55.711
Doctor.

01:08:07.544 --> 01:08:08.461
Extraordinary.

01:08:14.669 --> 01:08:17.836
You know more about that brain than anyone.

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:19.877
What's going on?

01:08:24.086 --> 01:08:25.211
I don't know.

01:08:27.502 --> 01:08:30.127
Whatever it is, it's keeping him alive.

01:08:40.294 --> 01:08:42.544
- I apologise.
- That's all right.

01:08:42.836 --> 01:08:44.461
It's something I ought to have seen.

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:49.377
Goodbye again, Inspector.

01:08:49.836 --> 01:08:51.252
Goodbye.

01:08:55.586 --> 01:08:58.877
...settlement was reached
about allowances and overtime pay.

01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:03.252
Prisoners' normal exercise periods and
other privileges which were stopped...

01:09:03.544 --> 01:09:06.877
...during the work to rule will
be restored tomorrow morning.

01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:10.669
A mass meeting of the Environmental
group of friends of the Earth...

01:09:10.961 --> 01:09:12.836
...has unanimously approved a plan...

01:09:13.127 --> 01:09:15.399
...to hold a protest march
from London to the...

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:18.252
...Nuclear Power Station
at Windscale in Cumbria.

01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:20.761
As part of their latest
campaign directed at...

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.961
...the dangers of nuclear
pollution in Britain.

01:09:24.044 --> 01:09:25.794
A spokesman for the campaign...

01:09:26.127 --> 01:09:29.377
...said the atomic plant and associated
waste materials at Windscale...

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:32.336
...constituted a threat to
generations of Englishmen.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.127
Okay It's simmering.

01:09:36.211 --> 01:09:37.752
I said, it's simmering.

01:09:37.836 --> 01:09:39.419
Are the onions brown?

01:09:40.627 --> 01:09:42.002
Yes.

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:43.669
What now?

01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:46.627
Put the onions and bacon in.

01:09:47.336 --> 01:09:48.544
Right.

01:09:49.169 --> 01:09:51.252
Onions and bacon going in.

01:09:53.544 --> 01:09:58.169
Then pour in the wine
and have it, uh, "bouillir".

01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:01.128
Have it what?

01:10:01.294 --> 01:10:03.378
Bubble for 2 minutes.

01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.669
Here at home...

01:10:05.711 --> 01:10:08.961
The Dean of Minster Cathedral
has announced that the Queen,

01:10:09.211 --> 01:10:11.811
...Members of the Cabinet and
representatives of the Commonwealth,

01:10:12.044 --> 01:10:14.878
...will be among the guests
at a Thanksgiving service...

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:20.253
...being held to commemorate the completion
of the font set up to restore the west front.

01:10:20.378 --> 01:10:24.461
It's amazing how many of those who might
have a grudge against him are dead.

01:10:24.711 --> 01:10:26.711
The family of those kids...

01:10:27.044 --> 01:10:29.836
...and that Lovelass, poor old bugger,
got out of the nick,

01:10:30.169 --> 01:10:33.086
...spent 6 months on the dole,
became a tramp...

01:10:33.419 --> 01:10:35.586
...and was finally knocked
flat by a bus.

01:10:49.044 --> 01:10:51.044
I want you to check on the father-in-law.

01:10:52.003 --> 01:10:54.711
I've discovered he's in property
here and abroad.

01:10:55.003 --> 01:10:56.794
She was the only daughter...

01:10:59.294 --> 01:11:01.378
Yes, yes it is.

01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:06.919
Of course. No, no... please, do.

01:11:09.211 --> 01:11:11.919
Flat B, 27 Latimer Gardens.

01:11:12.919 --> 01:11:14.628
Yes.

01:11:16.128 --> 01:11:17.294
It's her?

01:11:18.419 --> 01:11:20.794
I knew she couldn't just
drop him like that.

01:11:23.128 --> 01:11:25.919
Oh shit! After all that work.

01:11:43.294 --> 01:11:45.044
You wait in the kitchen.

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.878
Hello.

01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:56.711
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Not at all, I was glad to get your call.

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:01.253
I'm here for such a short time...

01:12:01.586 --> 01:12:05.294
You've made it warm, it's what I expected.

01:12:06.128 --> 01:12:10.044
- Could I offer you a drink?
- Oh yes whisky, please.

01:12:10.169 --> 01:12:11.669
Please, sit down.

01:12:11.711 --> 01:12:12.794
Thank you.

01:12:24.003 --> 01:12:26.711
- Anything?
- No, as it is.

01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:41.586
I lied to you when I told you...

01:12:41.878 --> 01:12:43.586
...I'd never seen him again.

01:12:46.336 --> 01:12:48.419
I never saw him in the office again.

01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:52.544
But I did see him.

01:12:57.919 --> 01:13:00.378
I lied because I knew so much more...

01:13:04.461 --> 01:13:08.044
...and what I knew seemed so incredible.

01:13:08.836 --> 01:13:12.253
You said it was urgent, I've had to leave
a situation I'd rather not have left.

01:13:12.878 --> 01:13:14.878
I'm sorry, but it was urgent to me.

01:13:15.336 --> 01:13:18.003
I'm surprised you found something
so important...

01:13:18.253 --> 01:13:20.253
...worth the attention of a witch doctor.

01:13:22.044 --> 01:13:25.794
When you're not being obvious,
I have hopes for you.

01:13:31.461 --> 01:13:34.253
You don't believe I could cause
my wife's death do you?

01:13:34.378 --> 01:13:36.544
- Oh Mr Molar...
- Please, listen to me.

01:13:38.044 --> 01:13:41.794
I know now it wasn't just
my wife, it was all of them.

01:13:42.378 --> 01:13:44.711
I made them happen: Copley, the children,

01:13:45.003 --> 01:13:46.753
...all of them, I made them happen.

01:13:46.919 --> 01:13:49.419
- I made that school burn.
- You couldn't.

01:13:49.753 --> 01:13:51.503
It's true, I made that school burn.

01:13:53.253 --> 01:13:55.503
I killed my mother,
I killed my father.

01:13:56.419 --> 01:13:59.961
Even my nurse, I made it happen.

01:14:00.628 --> 01:14:02.544
I made it happen.

01:14:04.044 --> 01:14:05.253
You don't believe me?

01:14:07.794 --> 01:14:11.836
It might be useful if I gave you
something to help you sleep tonight,

01:14:12.919 --> 01:14:14.586
...then we'll meet in my office tomorrow.

01:14:15.461 --> 01:14:19.503
I don't want your pills or to be
condescended to like some moron.

01:14:20.378 --> 01:14:22.961
I tell you, Zonfeld, I made it happen.

01:14:23.294 --> 01:14:24.836
I commanded it to happen!

01:14:29.378 --> 01:14:33.378
- You still don't believe me.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:14:34.044 --> 01:14:35.086
Tomorrow!

01:14:35.378 --> 01:14:36.836
For God's sake, Zonfeld,

01:14:37.128 --> 01:14:40.086
...I killed my father, I killed my mother,
I killed my wife.

01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:44.294
It's not just a damned headache.
What am I? How can I will death?

01:14:49.961 --> 01:14:51.211
I'm going.

01:14:51.794 --> 01:14:54.711
- I'll hold a space open at 11 o'clock.
- You stay here.

01:14:54.961 --> 01:14:56.461
Tomorrow at eleven.

01:14:56.836 --> 01:14:58.128
No.

01:15:02.003 --> 01:15:03.544
Not tomorrow.

01:15:04.919 --> 01:15:05.878
Now.

01:15:39.086 --> 01:15:40.711
Something's wrong.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:45.253
You've got full power captain.

01:15:53.211 --> 01:15:54.628
It's not responding!

01:15:56.044 --> 01:15:57.544
- Give me flaps 10.
- Flaps 10.

01:16:01.294 --> 01:16:02.753
It's all gone haywire, here!

01:16:15.878 --> 01:16:17.336
Morlar!

01:17:08.044 --> 01:17:10.044
What I don't understand is...

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:15.211
...why is it always destructive?

01:17:18.211 --> 01:17:20.128
Sometimes when I'm alone at night,

01:17:20.419 --> 01:17:23.003
...I've thought I've created all
the world's disasters,

01:17:23.836 --> 01:17:25.461
...but it's not true.

01:17:26.544 --> 01:17:28.628
We're all the devil's children.

01:17:29.753 --> 01:17:32.669
We find what powers the sun
and we make bombs of it.

01:17:34.086 --> 01:17:37.669
We create wealth
and we become obsessed with greed.

01:17:38.294 --> 01:17:40.336
We achieve power and we go mad.

01:17:40.628 --> 01:17:44.461
We always destroy. Why, Zonfeld why?

01:17:46.253 --> 01:17:50.003
Reports are just coming in that
a Jumbo Jet has crashed...

01:17:50.294 --> 01:17:51.878
...in central London.

01:17:52.211 --> 01:17:55.628
Over 300 people are believed
to have been on board the plane.

01:17:56.128 --> 01:18:00.211
Unconfirmed reports say that the plane
plunged into an office block and exploded,

01:18:00.961 --> 01:18:02.669
...falling debris has set fire to a cinema

01:18:03.003 --> 01:18:06.461
...and many people in the
streets below have been killed.

01:18:06.919 --> 01:18:09.794
Traffic in the West End
has been brought to a standstill.

01:18:10.044 --> 01:18:15.044
It's not yet known what caused the crash.
That is the end of this News Flash.

01:18:17.586 --> 01:18:21.628
Help me, Zonfeld, before I go mad.

01:18:25.836 --> 01:18:27.503
I could help no one that night.

01:18:28.378 --> 01:18:32.044
When I left those rooms I believed...

01:18:33.169 --> 01:18:34.794
...what I'd seen.

01:18:36.961 --> 01:18:38.961
When I got home I wasn't so certain.

01:18:39.878 --> 01:18:43.586
It seemed so beyond belief.

01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:46.794
And now... you believe again?

01:18:47.503 --> 01:18:48.586
Yes.

01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:54.419
When I saw what I saw today in that
hospital I felt I had to tell you.

01:18:56.086 --> 01:18:57.919
I won't disturb you anymore.

01:19:01.419 --> 01:19:02.586
Thank you.

01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.378
I'm grateful you came.

01:19:20.086 --> 01:19:21.544
What did you make of that?

01:19:23.086 --> 01:19:24.878
The victim was obviously a nut...

01:19:25.711 --> 01:19:28.753
...and now it turns out his
psychiatrist is one too.

01:19:34.419 --> 01:19:36.169
What are you really thinking?

01:19:37.544 --> 01:19:39.753
She just hasn't finished yet.

01:19:47.961 --> 01:19:49.711
Do you think she did it?

01:19:52.003 --> 01:19:53.628
No, Inspector,

01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:57.128
...that's a bit too much of a jump.

01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:15.003
But why kill him?

01:20:17.003 --> 01:20:20.919
It must have been because she believed
he was going to do something worse.

01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:23.378
Worse than the Jumbo Jet disaster?

01:20:25.461 --> 01:20:29.169
Certainly something worse
than she would be doing by killing him.

01:20:29.753 --> 01:20:31.961
As you say, it's not important,

01:20:35.753 --> 01:20:38.211
...what is important is
whether you're right.

01:20:39.169 --> 01:20:42.544
And if you are right, in getting a
confession that will stand up in court.

01:20:55.544 --> 01:20:57.211
Where the devil are you going?

01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:22.628
Excuse me, what is this for?

01:21:23.294 --> 01:21:26.294
We're getting ready for the
Thanksgiving Service tomorrow evening.

01:21:26.544 --> 01:21:29.503
The Queen, the Commonwealth
Prime Ministers, it's for that.

01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:31.961
3 million pounds.

01:21:33.628 --> 01:21:35.878
- It's not enough.
- What?

01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:37.794
The West Front's cracking.

01:21:40.003 --> 01:21:43.461
It goes right through to the nave.
If that goes, the whole lot goes.

01:21:44.878 --> 01:21:48.086
The tower's too heavy,
the foundations can't support it anymore.

01:21:54.419 --> 01:21:56.128
Thank you.

01:22:10.294 --> 01:22:13.378
They're worried about cracks
in the West front.

01:22:14.836 --> 01:22:16.003
We shall see.

01:22:19.628 --> 01:22:21.253
I am the man

01:22:21.544 --> 01:22:24.044
with the power to create catastrophe.

01:22:26.628 --> 01:22:28.503
Terri, I said I didn't want to be...

01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:34.461
I convinced her you would see me.

01:22:35.586 --> 01:22:36.544
Of course.

01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:40.294
I thought perhaps we should talk.

01:22:42.503 --> 01:22:44.169
You've decided, have you?

01:22:53.919 --> 01:22:57.086
It's been such a problem for me.

01:22:59.378 --> 01:23:01.586
I can't live with this knowledge...

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:04.086
...or die with it.

01:23:04.628 --> 01:23:06.878
I assume there were reasons.

01:23:07.836 --> 01:23:09.878
Yes, there were reasons.

01:23:11.753 --> 01:23:14.794
He came to see me at my home
the day after the Jumbo crash,

01:23:15.503 --> 01:23:17.503
...through all the chaos and the traffic.

01:23:18.586 --> 01:23:21.586
Somehow for me the reality
of ruined buildings,

01:23:21.878 --> 01:23:23.919
...ambulance men, broken bodies,

01:23:24.503 --> 01:23:27.378
...made what I'd seen in his flat
seem all the more impossible.

01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:32.086
He sensed that immediately and he left
before we'd exchanged two sentences.

01:23:34.753 --> 01:23:36.586
The next night he called,

01:23:37.378 --> 01:23:39.336
...he sounded unstable.

01:23:40.753 --> 01:23:41.711
He said:

01:23:43.044 --> 01:23:45.253
... "The space shot is nearing the moon."

01:23:46.003 --> 01:23:47.794
In 2 hours it goes into orbit.

01:23:48.419 --> 01:23:50.753
You have my word it won't return...

01:23:51.586 --> 01:23:55.544
While you're worrying about
that billion dollar coffin...

01:23:55.836 --> 01:23:57.419
...striking the moon,

01:23:58.128 --> 01:24:00.003
...spare a thought for the millions...

01:24:00.586 --> 01:24:04.461
...they might have fed with all
that technology and expertise.

01:24:05.878 --> 01:24:08.336
How concerned all our
great statesmen are...

01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:10.836
...about those three...

01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:16.086
...wonderful human beings while
millions of others rot to death.

01:24:16.336 --> 01:24:19.169
Listen, Zonfeld, listen to me.

01:24:20.336 --> 01:24:24.003
I've found a way to do
God's dirty work for him.

01:24:24.419 --> 01:24:26.919
The Royal Chieftain, the parasites...

01:24:27.253 --> 01:24:30.086
...and the whole gang
of international rabble rousers,

01:24:30.419 --> 01:24:32.461
...are going to bleat to the
Almighty nothing...

01:24:32.753 --> 01:24:35.044
...in his great Temple...

01:24:35.336 --> 01:24:38.128
...to give praise for 3 million pounds.

01:24:39.086 --> 01:24:42.586
I promise you,
the moment they kneel to pray...

01:24:44.044 --> 01:24:47.586
...I will bring the whole edifice down...

01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:50.503
...on their unworthy heads.

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.461
He sounded quite mad,

01:24:53.753 --> 01:24:56.919
...yet I believed every word he said.
I had to go to him.

01:24:57.878 --> 01:24:59.503
The streets were deserted,

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:03.044
...even the police were more concerned
with that traffic accident in space.

01:25:07.753 --> 01:25:10.878
No one saw me. No one cared.

01:25:12.711 --> 01:25:15.211
The porter didn't even look up
from his television set.

01:25:29.711 --> 01:25:31.461
I didn't know what I was going to do.

01:25:35.378 --> 01:25:37.419
It's unlocked, come in.

01:25:42.836 --> 01:25:44.461
I thought you'd come.

01:25:45.794 --> 01:25:48.336
Just a moment, I don't want to miss this.

01:25:54.878 --> 01:25:56.336
I've poured you a drink.

01:25:57.878 --> 01:26:00.628
I thought we ought
to be civilised about it.

01:26:09.753 --> 01:26:12.919
He sat watching
the last moments of catastrophe.

01:26:17.836 --> 01:26:20.336
Those were the last words.
They've lost radio contact.

01:26:22.628 --> 01:26:25.419
Achilles 6, the mission
that was to inaugurate...

01:26:25.711 --> 01:26:28.628
...man's first permanent station on
the moon is locked into an orbit...

01:26:28.919 --> 01:26:31.919
...that, unless some miracle occurs,
will produce the first...

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.919
...American disaster in space.

01:26:37.503 --> 01:26:40.128
Even then I thought
I might somehow stop it.

01:26:43.461 --> 01:26:45.836
For a moment, it turned me to stone.

01:26:49.961 --> 01:26:51.669
A response at last.

01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:56.461
I knew as long as he lived
that there was no way of stopping it.

01:27:11.253 --> 01:27:12.628
And I failed.

01:27:13.336 --> 01:27:16.086
I couldn't tell anyone,
no one would believe me.

01:27:16.544 --> 01:27:18.419
They'd say the madness was mine.

01:27:21.794 --> 01:27:23.419
And perhaps it was.

01:27:27.336 --> 01:27:29.211
Then we are mad together.

01:27:30.919 --> 01:27:34.794
I have seen the Cathedral and I think
I know what's keeping him alive.

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:38.753
There's nothing you can do,
no one will believe you.

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:41.128
I'm going to try.

01:27:41.419 --> 01:27:43.044
I wish you luck.

01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:46.503
You're not arresting me?

01:27:47.586 --> 01:27:50.503
It's a question of priorities.

01:27:56.294 --> 01:28:00.003
You found the murderer, but two crack pots
don't add up to one good theory.

01:28:00.294 --> 01:28:03.586
- I still don't believe you.
- To begin with Morlar isn't dead.

01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:07.211
He's fighting to live
with superhuman resistance, right?

01:28:07.628 --> 01:28:10.253
- Against all reason.
- All right.

01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:14.294
Against all reason he believed
he had the power to destroy a plane.

01:28:14.586 --> 01:28:16.253
To shatter a cathedral.

01:28:16.586 --> 01:28:18.878
He's alive, so is the belief.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:21.169
He said he would do it, I believe he will.

01:28:21.461 --> 01:28:22.419
How?

01:28:22.919 --> 01:28:24.836
I told you about those experiments.

01:28:25.128 --> 01:28:27.336
Russia, Denmark, the United States.

01:28:27.628 --> 01:28:31.669
I have seen a man shatter glass
just by concentrating his thoughts.

01:28:31.794 --> 01:28:32.878
Brunel...

01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:34.461
A hundred years ago,

01:28:34.711 --> 01:28:37.794
...the idea of sending the human
voice across oceans was madness.

01:28:38.086 --> 01:28:39.586
But Minster Cathedral...

01:28:39.878 --> 01:28:42.294
But Zonfeld believed he could do it,

01:28:42.628 --> 01:28:44.628
...she believed enough to kill him!

01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:48.461
But why Minster, why a cathedral?

01:28:49.128 --> 01:28:52.961
Because it's the Church,
the Establishment, everything he hates.

01:28:54.503 --> 01:28:58.128
All right, what would you suggest we do?

01:28:58.419 --> 01:29:00.669
Cancel the ceremony, close the Cathedral.

01:29:01.544 --> 01:29:03.044
Are you mad?

01:29:03.378 --> 01:29:05.503
Do you know the kind of preparation...

01:29:05.794 --> 01:29:07.044
Christ, Brunel.

01:29:07.586 --> 01:29:09.503
What reason am I going to give them?

01:29:09.919 --> 01:29:12.086
Your story? They'd lock me up.

01:29:12.378 --> 01:29:13.794
Go to the Dean.

01:29:14.086 --> 01:29:17.128
He shouldn't question
the power of unseen forces.

01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:22.753
It's quite out of the question.

01:29:23.086 --> 01:29:26.044
I have the surveyor's word for the
soundness of the Cathedral...

01:29:26.378 --> 01:29:29.419
...and Her Majesty can't be forced
to change long-laid plans...

01:29:29.711 --> 01:29:31.711
...simply because a madman makes threats.

01:29:31.961 --> 01:29:33.794
Sir, with respect,

01:29:34.503 --> 01:29:36.503
...we believe this threat is real.

01:29:37.169 --> 01:29:39.378
We call it reasonable suspicion,

01:29:39.961 --> 01:29:41.503
...you might call it faith.

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:45.461
Well, moral philosophy,

01:29:46.044 --> 01:29:48.294
...something one doesn't
expect from the Yard.

01:29:49.753 --> 01:29:53.003
Science can't explain why Morlar's mind
is still alive.

01:29:53.878 --> 01:29:55.878
And I don't think it can explain...

01:29:56.169 --> 01:29:58.586
...what his mind is capable of either.

01:29:59.294 --> 01:30:00.711
But you would agree...

01:30:01.003 --> 01:30:03.544
...that there is much
that science cannot explain.

01:30:04.336 --> 01:30:06.294
I've done you an injustice, Inspector.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.919
I must grant an open mind on
Mr. Morlar...

01:30:10.503 --> 01:30:12.086
...and I will pray for his soul.

01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:17.503
- Couldn't we go above the Dean?
- I could go to the Home Secretary.

01:30:17.794 --> 01:30:21.461
Tell him: "There's this maniac, three
parts dead, sending out brain waves..."

01:30:21.753 --> 01:30:24.794
"...powerful enough to shatter
cathedrals from 2 miles away".

01:30:26.169 --> 01:30:28.878
He's in Scotland, coming
down by train tomorrow.

01:30:29.628 --> 01:30:33.169
I'll try to catch him at Leeds,
talk to him on the way down.

01:30:33.919 --> 01:30:35.253
All right?

01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:45.419
It hurts to tell you,
I've failed again.

01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:50.253
Already you are becoming used
to my failures...

01:32:50.544 --> 01:32:53.253
...and we've only known each other
such a short time.

01:32:56.086 --> 01:32:58.169
I went back to the hospital.

01:32:58.544 --> 01:33:00.544
I stood and stared at him,

01:33:02.878 --> 01:33:04.544
...it seemed so easy,

01:33:05.169 --> 01:33:07.336
...cut one tube, pull one plug,

01:33:09.419 --> 01:33:11.419
...a dozen ways to end it.

01:33:13.044 --> 01:33:14.628
But I couldn't...

01:33:15.753 --> 01:33:17.753
...finish what I had begun.

01:33:19.919 --> 01:33:23.919
So I leave our problem with you,
my dear Inspector.

01:33:24.044 --> 01:33:25.628
Forgive me.

01:34:39.336 --> 01:34:40.878
It's the lorries.

01:34:42.128 --> 01:34:43.711
Terrible vibrations.

01:34:44.961 --> 01:34:46.961
They should ban them from this area.

01:34:56.586 --> 01:34:58.586
Riots at nuclear plant.

01:34:59.253 --> 01:35:02.294
- Any luck?
- He had meetings, wouldn't see me.

01:35:02.919 --> 01:35:05.159
Secretary said he'd make an
appointment tomorrow morning.

01:35:05.753 --> 01:35:08.419
I couldn't just barge in
with the story we have.

01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:11.253
- What news from the hospital?
- I don't understand.

01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:13.794
His EEG went crazy during the evening,

01:35:14.336 --> 01:35:17.044
...then it settled, now
it's increasing again.

01:35:17.378 --> 01:35:19.086
I don't know what it means.

01:35:21.544 --> 01:35:23.128
Zonfeld's dead.

01:35:25.169 --> 01:35:26.128
Suicide?

01:35:28.836 --> 01:35:32.878
There are times when I know you're right
and others when I know it just can't be.

01:35:34.336 --> 01:35:38.378
Frankly, I don't know what to do.

01:35:41.794 --> 01:35:43.544
Watch, wait,

01:35:44.128 --> 01:35:45.878
...hope we are insane.

01:37:22.544 --> 01:37:24.086
I have no time for this, Inspector.

01:37:24.419 --> 01:37:27.044
I know, but rubble
is falling from the church.

01:37:27.378 --> 01:37:29.919
That's what the fund is about,
it's the traffic.

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.836
The traffic has been diverted, there's...

01:37:33.128 --> 01:37:36.461
I understand your concern,
but I promise you have nothing to fear.

01:37:37.544 --> 01:37:41.461
Now pray for the church,
pray for your own peace of mind.

01:38:00.961 --> 01:38:03.253
Guards, general salute!

01:38:03.503 --> 01:38:05.503
Present arms!

01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:43.003
- Now are you convinced?
- Enough to want to stop it! Yes.

01:38:43.086 --> 01:38:44.836
There's one thing we can do.

01:38:47.628 --> 01:38:49.086
I'll buy it at any price.

01:38:49.544 --> 01:38:50.836
Throw a bomb scare.

01:38:51.128 --> 01:38:52.608
We could empty the church in minutes.

01:38:52.836 --> 01:38:56.044
We'll do it. You warn them in there,
I'll clear the whole area.

01:38:56.711 --> 01:38:59.586
He'll never believe me, you go,
I'll get the area cleared.

01:39:00.628 --> 01:39:02.878
Brunel, no panic.

01:39:08.336 --> 01:39:11.044
- It's quarter to 7, nearly time.
- Very good.

01:39:11.544 --> 01:39:13.336
Inspector Brunel, French Exchange.

01:39:14.169 --> 01:39:18.211
We've had a bomb threat,
the Cathedral has to be cleared at once.

01:39:18.461 --> 01:39:21.541
It's just a hoax, we've been through
that church 3 times, the Clergy have too.

01:39:21.753 --> 01:39:23.794
Not a prayer book that hasn't been checked.

01:39:24.544 --> 01:39:28.878
We have every reason to believe
it's not a hoax. You can't take the chance.

01:39:28.919 --> 01:39:31.878
Double check the main aisle and the section
held for the Queen and the Minister.

01:39:31.961 --> 01:39:33.419
- Yes sir...
- But sir...

01:39:33.461 --> 01:39:37.128
I'll handle this, inspector.
Now, what's the source of this call?

01:39:37.169 --> 01:39:39.211
I'll get the Assistant Commissioner.

01:39:49.461 --> 01:39:51.294
- Sir...
- have you seen the A.C.?

01:39:55.461 --> 01:39:58.003
They wouldn't believe me,
they think it's a hoax, talk to them.

01:39:58.461 --> 01:40:01.294
I got the Deacon. He gave them the news,
they'll be out shortly.

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:04.628
- That should convince them.
- It'll take time to clear this crowd.

01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:08.336
Come on, come on, come on,
get them out of there.

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:20.294
He didn't believe you,
they're not cancelling it.

01:40:20.586 --> 01:40:21.753
Look!

01:40:23.794 --> 01:40:27.544
I will bring the whole edifice down
on their unworthy heads!

01:40:30.378 --> 01:40:33.628
Get them out of there,
I'm going to the hospital.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:35.294
The Queen!

01:40:45.836 --> 01:40:48.919
Stop the procession.

01:40:49.003 --> 01:40:51.211
Stop the procession!

01:40:56.336 --> 01:40:57.711
Get out of my way!

01:40:58.169 --> 01:40:59.128
Stop!

01:41:02.586 --> 01:41:04.669
Clear the Cathedral at once.

01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:07.669
It is about to collapse, run!

01:41:07.711 --> 01:41:11.503
Out! Out! Take every
exit, go on! Out!

01:41:14.378 --> 01:41:16.419
Stop!

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:18.461
Stop!

01:41:21.211 --> 01:41:23.878
There's a bomb, get the car out of the way.

01:41:24.294 --> 01:41:26.044
It's all right! It's all right!

01:41:31.628 --> 01:41:35.669
Here at Minster Cathedral a man has
just stopped the Queen's car...

01:41:42.711 --> 01:41:44.503
Look, up there, the cross,

01:41:45.294 --> 01:41:46.919
...it's moving!

01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:51.794
Watch out!

01:42:00.086 --> 01:42:01.586
Come on, get it out now.

01:42:44.711 --> 01:42:47.336
Use the other door!
Don't panic!

01:43:08.044 --> 01:43:09.503
Go back!

01:43:09.794 --> 01:43:12.128
It's blocked outside, go back!

01:43:24.669 --> 01:43:27.378
Use the side exits.

01:44:07.419 --> 01:44:11.253
All emergency personnel
proceed to their stations immediately.

01:45:42.461 --> 01:45:44.044
Sir, sir look!

01:45:51.544 --> 01:45:52.461
The pen.

01:45:52.878 --> 01:45:54.253
The pen.

01:46:24.586 --> 01:46:26.003
Windscale?

01:46:27.878 --> 01:46:29.503
The nuclear plant.

01:46:42.378 --> 01:46:43.836
Brunel!

01:46:56.586 --> 01:46:58.128
I am the man...

01:46:58.461 --> 01:47:01.044
...with the power to create catastrophe.
