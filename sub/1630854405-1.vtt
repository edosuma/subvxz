WEBVTT

00:57.058 --> 00:59.826
- I'm so excited.
- I'm so excited too.

00:59.961 --> 01:02.296
This one looks so nice here.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.732
Yeah, it is a sign, people.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.305
Alright, kids.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.739
Come on.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.408
Come on out.

01:14.541 --> 01:16.277
I have some. Thanks.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.913
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.115
It'll be fine, honey. Relax.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.782
He lives here?

01:23.184 --> 01:24.684
That's what he said.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.288
It must be up there.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.789
I can't wait till Santa Claus
brings my gift!

01:29.924 --> 01:31.658
You mailed my letter,
didn't you, Daddy?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.227
Of course, sweetie. Of course.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.667
Last one there is a rotten egg!

01:40.800 --> 01:43.070
- And that's you!
- Slowly.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.112
How can you still believe in Santa?
That stuff is for babies.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.913
I know that Santa Claus exists

01:53.047 --> 01:55.682
and right now he's crazy busy
with his helper elves.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.303
Yeah. Of course.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.938
Maybe he's not home.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.074
We should go up the staircase.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.847
I don't know why we'd need
an escape hatch, Tony.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.518
Vince wouldn't be looking
at five to ten right now.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.053
That was bad luck.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.388
Vince got pinched
for an old crime.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.688
I really miss him.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.527
No, no, no, no.
You don't know who it is.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.328
That's why we answer the door,

02:41.462 --> 02:43.364
so we can see who it is.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.300
-It might be the cops.
-We aren't thieves anymore,
okay?

02:46.434 --> 02:49.236
-Try telling that to Vince.
-Well, I'll tell you
one thing about Vince.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.006
He wouldn't be peeing his pants
if someone knocked at the door.

02:52.139 --> 02:55.242
That's why I've been the lookout
for the past 15 years, alright?

02:55.742 --> 02:57.811
You just stay in your lane.
Let me do my job.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.516
-Okay. Answer it.
-Want me to answer the door?

03:02.649 --> 03:04.919
-Permission granted.
-Okay, okay.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.688
Hi, uncle Frank!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.458
Hello, kiddos!

03:11.158 --> 03:12.960
I'd like
to introduce you to Tony.

03:13.094 --> 03:14.428
Hi, uncle Tony!

03:14.562 --> 03:15.963
- Alright.
- Oh, uncle Tony!

03:16.097 --> 03:17.864
I told you, you got
nothing to worry about.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.934
- It's good to see you.
- Look what I brought.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.436
Oh, my gosh.
It's our favorite book.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.803
Puffins?

03:26.107 --> 03:28.109
Listen, take it over
to the couch,

03:28.242 --> 03:30.177
and I'll be over there
in a minute.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.946
Um, do you guys have a minute?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.881
We, uh, we need to talk.
We have an emergency.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.584
Of course. Of course.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.819
Sure. Take a seat. What's up?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.855
Okay. Let's do it upstairs.

03:42.289 --> 03:44.624
We already moved the bombs
up to over there, so don't...

03:44.757 --> 03:48.095
No, that-- Hey. Please.

03:48.229 --> 03:48.895
After you.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.298
Oh, no. This is empty.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.566
It's empty.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.002
So, what's the occasion?

03:55.136 --> 03:57.871
Frank and Tony, would you mind
doing us a huge favor?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.639
-Sure.
-Would it be okay to look after

03:59.772 --> 04:01.408
Liam and Olivia
just for a couple hours?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.776
We need to do some
last minute shopping.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.979
-Please?
-Oh, that'd be great!

04:05.112 --> 04:06.180
That'd be so much fun!

04:06.313 --> 04:07.714
-Thank you.
-This is a bless.

04:07.847 --> 04:08.882
We can teach them
how to toss the dice.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.484
-Play the ponies.
-Seriously?

04:11.118 --> 04:13.587
Peter, that's ancient history.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.589
Yeah, history. Exactly. History.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.124
You and Vince, you promised me

04:17.258 --> 04:19.226
you'd turned over a new leaf.
Tony promised too.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.661
Look what I got us.
We're unemployed.

04:21.794 --> 04:23.030
Hey, you know what could be fun?

04:23.164 --> 04:24.731
We could teach the kids
to pick a pocket.

04:24.864 --> 04:27.001
You know, uh,
hot-wire a car, crack a safe.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.969
That's not going to happen.
- No.

04:29.103 --> 04:31.906
Listen. You guys go shopping.
Don't worry about a thing.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.374
The kids will be safe
here with us.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.942
We're going to show them
some good old fashioned

04:35.075 --> 04:36.676
-Christmas cheer!
-Thank you!

04:36.809 --> 04:38.678
-Thank you so much.
-Thanks, guys.
We appreciate it.

04:38.811 --> 04:39.980
Yeah, thanks really.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.949
Uh, cops!

04:44.817 --> 04:46.620
- Now it's my turn!
- Oh,

04:46.753 --> 04:48.189
- that's my lucky balaclava!
- Hey, hey, hey

04:48.322 --> 04:49.490
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, what are you,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.291
a bunch of wild animals here?

04:50.424 --> 04:51.458
Come on.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.526
- Oh, this.
- Sorry.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.893
This one didn't rip.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.828
That's actually
my ski mask, okay?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.666
Hey, it's a good thing
you didn't bust that one,
because if you did,

04:58.798 --> 05:02.203
you wouldn't be able
to stay with uncle Tony
as your babysitter today.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.737
Hooray! We're going to stay
with uncle and uncle.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.407
Too bad uncle Vince is not here.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.109
I just hope he's having fun
in the Caribbean.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.912
-Oh, he's having fun, alright.
-Oh, my gosh.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.915
Vince is having so much fun
in the Caribbean. Right?

05:15.049 --> 05:17.318
He's there
with his buddies, you know.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.686
Hanging out.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.621
He'll be back.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.325
-One day. On good behavior.
-Hey, hey, what gives?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.260
We got rules here,
huh, kid, come on.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.860
Come on. Off the couch.
Off the couch.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.064
-Come on.
-uncle Frank said
we had no rules.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.599
I did say there are no rules,

05:31.731 --> 05:34.834
except follow the rules
at mom and dad's house.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.637
- Great. Come here.
- Yeah.

05:36.769 --> 05:39.306
Big story behind this couch.
One night, we're in Vegas,

05:39.440 --> 05:41.141
- we picked up a couple of broads and...
-  -Hey,

05:41.275 --> 05:43.377
that's a great story.
We're going to go.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.612
- Yes. We should go.
- Yeah, okay, you go.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.614
Look what I found!

05:46.746 --> 05:49.516
Yeah. Yeah, oh, okay.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.818
Yeah. That's a crowbar.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.087
That's not a big deal.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.022
I'm sure you have
a crowbar at your house.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.591
I'm sure you have one
at home too.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.692
What's this?

05:59.226 --> 06:01.996
Okay, those are
professional bolt cutters.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.432
Which, uh, you can
borrow anytime.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.799
Because not everybody has these.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.035
Don't worry, guys. Your kids are

06:08.168 --> 06:09.303
- in good hands.
- Yeah.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.704
Okay. Well, you be safe,

06:10.837 --> 06:12.172
- all four of you.
- Yeah,

06:12.306 --> 06:13.941
- okay. Thank you.
- Love you! Bye!

06:14.074 --> 06:15.542
- Be good, please.
- Bye!

06:15.676 --> 06:16.876
Bye, gorgeous!

06:17.844 --> 06:19.113
-Bye, mommy.
-Toodles!

06:19.246 --> 06:20.948
- Okay, alright. Bye.
- Toodles!

06:21.081 --> 06:22.349
-Bye, uncle Tony.
-Bye, Bob. Oh, thank you.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.951
Liam, Olivia. Let me teach you

06:24.084 --> 06:25.286
a thing or two.
Come on over here.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.654
- Okay.
- Tools of the trade.

06:26.786 --> 06:27.621
- Have some fun!
- Alright.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.922
You got your crowbar,

06:29.056 --> 06:30.224
your bolt cutters,
your blowtorch.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.525
You know what
these are for here?

06:32.026 --> 06:33.427
I don't like that we're
leaving them alone again

06:33.560 --> 06:34.995
this Christmas too.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.829
We're not leaving them alone.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.300
Anyway, last Christmas,
they had a blast.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.568
Ha! They did, and...

06:42.069 --> 06:44.538
- you made peace with your brother Frank.
-  -Exactly.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.207
And not one, but two
uncles that they adore.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.876
But I just wish you'd
remember to get the gifts.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.811
What? The gifts again? Come on.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.846
We'll be there in a flash.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.716
I know a shortcut.
We'll miss the traffic.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.117
Okay.

08:39.052 --> 08:43.457
This is because your uncle Frank
is a world class crack safe.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.235
Let's check Olivia's letter

08:55.369 --> 08:57.404
and see what she wants
for Christmas.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.473
Liam's easy.

08:59.606 --> 09:02.309
He wants a Star Shuttle
whatchamacallit.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.146
You didn't lose her letter,
did you?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.215
It must to be here somewhere.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.017
Just like you lost
my police badge.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.985
I had the letter.
I showed you the letter.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.454
I feel like I can't ever
trust you.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.222
It must have fallen out
of my pocket.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.724
Watch out!

09:21.895 --> 09:22.896
Are you okay?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.531
Yeah. All okay.

09:25.032 --> 09:26.567
-Hm.
-Okay.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.139
What was that?

09:35.976 --> 09:38.245
Hey, pay attention here.
Pay attention, alright?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.113
You got to spin
and hear the click.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.354
I have to ask my parents
to buy me one.

09:47.488 --> 09:49.556
You could've asked Santa
in a wish letter.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.292
Are you still rattling on
about that garbage?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.228
Santa Claus does not exist.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.137
Are you okay?

10:04.738 --> 10:05.806
Hey.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.642
Oh, for crying out loud.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.811
That was a serious blow.

10:11.411 --> 10:14.181
Dasher, Prancer, Blitzen, Vixen!

10:14.314 --> 10:16.216
Where in the blazes are you?

10:16.884 --> 10:19.119
Cupid? Rudolph!

10:19.520 --> 10:23.824
Aww, get back here,
you pea-brained flying goats!

10:24.191 --> 10:26.660
-Tony! How dare you!
-What?

10:26.793 --> 10:28.128
What I do?

10:28.262 --> 10:30.230
What, what's wrong with you?

10:31.398 --> 10:32.866
I'm the safe cracker!

10:33.001 --> 10:34.501
I'll teach you guys.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.570
Here you go, yeah.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.373
Listen, sir.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.475
If there's somewhere
you need to be,

10:41.608 --> 10:44.511
we can, we, we can
give you a ride.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.620
This? I don't think so.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.423
Besides, serious plan B.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.961
And I'd say you've done
enough damage already.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.835
Wunorse Openslae,
I've had an accident.

11:08.970 --> 11:10.304
No, I'm fine.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.473
But the reindeer panicked
and flew away.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.208
I need you to send somebody

11:15.342 --> 11:16.743
to pick me up right away.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.714
Send, uh, Bushy Evergreen
with sleigh number two.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.984
It's out of order?

11:23.450 --> 11:26.653
Okay, ah! Send Jimmy Snow
with his flying van.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.690
What are you talking about
he's on vacation?

11:29.823 --> 11:33.560
Who authorized his holiday
on the 24th of December?

11:34.194 --> 11:36.597
Oh. I did.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.334
You can't be serious. Ugh!

11:40.467 --> 11:44.005
She, she never could get here
in time to pick me up.

11:44.771 --> 11:48.308
What do you mean
she deserves another chance?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.411
No. Not her!

11:52.312 --> 11:54.082
She's not reliable.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.950
She's totally unreliable.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.620
She'll never
make it in time.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.825
Is somebody coming
to pick you up?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.728
It's an unmitigated disaster.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.601
Is that Santa Claus?

12:14.735 --> 12:17.671
Whoever it is,
nobody open the door.

12:18.906 --> 12:19.873
I got it.

12:20.374 --> 12:22.010
Frankie, what are you do--
Frankie!

12:22.142 --> 12:23.577
It could be the cops. Frankie!

12:23.710 --> 12:25.145
What are you doing?

12:25.278 --> 12:26.346
Mm-hmm.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.515
- Oh...
- Oh! Oh!

12:28.649 --> 12:31.885
- Frank,
what are you doing? Come on!
- I got it.

12:32.020 --> 12:33.186
Frankie!

12:33.320 --> 12:34.755
You don't like strangers
in the house.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.523
You bring strange women home
every weekend.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.126
That's a good point.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.994
Hey, listen, she could be a cop.

12:40.128 --> 12:42.496
What about all the loot
we got stashed in here?

12:42.629 --> 12:45.198
No! She must be
one of Santa's elves.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.035
Elf? Get real.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.937
- Hey. A little help?
- Yeah, I'll give you
a little help.

12:50.071 --> 12:51.872
-Here we go.
Right this way, ma'am.
-Oh, oh.

12:52.006 --> 12:53.807
-Right this way, come on.
-No, no! It's cold out there!

12:53.941 --> 12:56.276
-Go back in...
-No, no, no. Frank. I got this.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.477
-I'm not letting her go.
-Frank!

12:57.611 --> 12:59.212
Uncle Tony, if you kick her out,

12:59.346 --> 13:00.681
I'm going to scream.

13:03.017 --> 13:05.352
Uncle, uncle, uncle. Okay.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.320
-Relax. Lighten up, okay?
-Alright.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.923
-I won't throw her out.
-Yeah.

13:09.057 --> 13:10.624
Come on, we'll go over here.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.459
-Right over here.
-Yeah, we got you.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.928
-This way.
-That way.

13:14.062 --> 13:15.729
Hey, let's make her
comfortable right here.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.297
- Okay, come on.
- Nice and comfortable.

13:17.431 --> 13:19.332
Hey, hey, hey.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.536
-Yeah.
-Hey. You okay? Huh?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.805
- We're sorry.
- You okay? Hey.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.374
Alright. Make yourself at home.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.944
Hey, let's see
if her heart is beating.

13:30.078 --> 13:32.446
Look at the bash on her head!

13:32.579 --> 13:34.414
You two kids
get out of here. Upstairs.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.516
Let's go. Come on, until
we figure this out, alright?

13:36.650 --> 13:38.585
I already told you,
she's an elf.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.787
Let's go.

13:42.123 --> 13:43.356
Hey.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.358
You see what I see?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.929
Yeah. Nice jewelry.

13:48.462 --> 13:50.098
I wonder if she's wealthy.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.733
Some nice gems right there.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.906
Sir, are you okay?

13:59.339 --> 14:01.109
Do you need medical attention?

14:01.241 --> 14:04.112
A doctor?
That's just what I need.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.780
I'm running late enough
as it is.

14:08.149 --> 14:09.850
Can't you see all the presents

14:09.984 --> 14:11.818
I, I have to deliver?

14:15.455 --> 14:16.656
Oh...

14:17.691 --> 14:18.725
Rudolph.

14:21.229 --> 14:22.529
Oh...

14:24.065 --> 14:25.599
Rudolph.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.036
I knew you wouldn't abandon me.

14:29.971 --> 14:31.038
Rudolph.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.941
You think you can pull
the sleigh by yourself?

14:34.075 --> 14:35.143
Huh?

14:35.275 --> 14:36.643
Uh...

14:37.145 --> 14:38.378
Guess not.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.552
Hello? Hello? How are you?

14:47.155 --> 14:48.822
She doesn't wake up. Now what?

14:48.956 --> 14:51.092
I'll wake her up. Trust me.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.325
No!

14:52.459 --> 14:53.393
What?

14:53.527 --> 14:54.962
No violence.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.565
I'm going to boil up
a pot of my special spices.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.934
That'll get her going.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.169
Or kill her even faster.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.636
You don't like her, do you?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.871
-I don't like strangers.
-You don't like anyone.

15:05.006 --> 15:06.306
Bingo.

15:13.281 --> 15:14.215
Hey!

15:14.347 --> 15:16.550
Get your mitts off of that book!

15:17.384 --> 15:18.618
Where am I?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.654
Who are you?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.423
Relax. I am Frank.

15:23.557 --> 15:24.992
And this is Tony.

15:25.126 --> 15:28.129
We found you unconscious
outside that door

15:28.262 --> 15:29.663
and saved your life.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.067
Now we spilled our beans,
how about you?

15:33.201 --> 15:34.969
What gives, huh? What gives?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.570
Uh...

15:37.271 --> 15:38.973
I don't know who I am.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.208
I can't remember a thing.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.474
Likely story.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.910
I believe you.

15:43.044 --> 15:45.112
All I know is that
I have something to do.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.582
I have something
very important. Urgent!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.483
Would you like a cup of spices?

15:50.617 --> 15:52.119
- Um...
- What are you, Martha Stewart?

15:52.253 --> 15:53.420
I wish.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.422
What? What's next?
Essential oils?

15:55.555 --> 15:59.426
You'll never, ever
have my essential oil!

16:03.264 --> 16:04.464
I got to ask.

16:04.598 --> 16:06.533
What exactly are you
doing out here?

16:07.701 --> 16:10.804
I stopped here
so they could fill up.

16:10.938 --> 16:12.606
And they need a ton of water

16:12.739 --> 16:14.275
to go all the way
around the world.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.809
In this fog?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.546
I created it so nobody
would see me.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.121
What is this book?

16:27.255 --> 16:29.422
You wouldn't believe
who gave us this book last year.

16:29.556 --> 16:32.093
Hey. Thought you had
a bruise on your head.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.327
I did.

16:33.894 --> 16:35.695
Maybe the book holds a solution

16:35.829 --> 16:37.064
to understand who I am.

16:37.198 --> 16:38.665
Well, it is a very special book.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.034
-And I'd be honored
to read it to you.
-Yeah?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.701
I got a better idea.
What do you say

16:41.835 --> 16:43.271
we give this lovely lady

16:43.403 --> 16:44.537
-a tour of the house.
-Yeah.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.108
Shall we? Right this way, okay?

16:47.241 --> 16:48.675
Here's our lovely kitchen.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.777
And over here is
Frankie's bedroom.

16:50.912 --> 16:52.412
- Here's the door.
- Oh.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.680
- No! No, no, no!
- Oh, no.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.182
-Now she's gone! She's gone!
-No.

16:55.316 --> 16:56.250
-She's gone, Frank!
-No!

16:56.384 --> 16:57.550
-Let go!
-No, you don't!

16:57.684 --> 16:59.320
- I was...
- Hey!

16:59.486 --> 17:03.057
Would you throw a woman out
on the street with memory loss?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.259
- Who are you talking to?
- Okay.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.460
Just let me read her one story.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.930
Frank.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.198
Do it for the kids, Tony.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.204
Of course, the kids.

17:18.005 --> 17:20.007
- One story.
- Thank you.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.684
She woke up, but she can't
remember anything.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.787
The knock on her head must have
made her lose her memory.

17:37.992 --> 17:40.493
We might as well tell her.
She's an elf!

17:41.195 --> 17:44.031
That's enough already, Olivia.
I'll prove to you that
she's not an elf.

17:44.165 --> 17:47.068
This way you'll stop
pestering everyone
with your silly stories!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.870
Okay. Go ahead
and get all grumpy.

17:51.005 --> 17:53.840
When you find out that
I'm right, and you're wrong!

18:35.548 --> 18:38.219
I guess I lost
my power with the crash.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.322
I think he's had a concussion.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.722
Let's call 911.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.327
Dasher! Prancer!

18:46.460 --> 18:47.560
Blitzen, Vixen!

18:47.694 --> 18:48.895
We're late!

18:49.397 --> 18:50.998
-Look at that!
-Kids?

18:51.465 --> 18:53.034
Hey, quit the roughhouse.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.269
-Come on. Get, get in here.
Let's go.
-Hey, hey, hey.

18:55.403 --> 18:57.138
Give me some. Give me some.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.540
I'm Liam.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.543
I know. And you're Olivia.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.646
How do you know their names?
We didn't tell you nothing.

19:07.281 --> 19:08.349
I don't know.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.683
I do. You know all
the names of the children

19:10.817 --> 19:12.685
- because you're an elf.
- You know what?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.288
This whole thing
stinks to high heaven.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.790
We're going to read this book
now, and then little miss
know-it-all

19:16.924 --> 19:19.193
is going to take a powder, okay?

19:21.095 --> 19:23.397
I wonder what stories
there are this time.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.266
What do you mean?

19:26.067 --> 19:28.903
The stories always change.
It's a very special book.

19:29.036 --> 19:32.206
- No. I don't believe it.
- Alright, kids.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.606
Keep your ears open.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.675
We got to figure out who this

19:35.809 --> 19:37.677
sweet lady is.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.114
Here we go.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.249
Oh...

19:45.553 --> 19:47.121
The book is weird.

19:48.022 --> 19:49.523
<i>The Puffins. Didi.</i>

19:49.656 --> 19:50.925
<i>Her hair ties are so cute.</i>

19:51.058 --> 19:52.326
<i>Pie! Super-duper-powerful Pie!</i>

19:52.460 --> 19:54.727
Didi, Pie.
I've heard these names before.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.297
<i>Tic and Tac.</i>

19:56.430 --> 19:58.165
Or Tic tock.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.034
Like a ticking bomb.

20:01.068 --> 20:01.734
Hmm.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.370
Ugh! There's Otto.

20:03.504 --> 20:05.906
<i>Playing his tricks again!</i>

20:07.807 --> 20:09.043
<i>And with Johnny Puff,</i>

20:09.176 --> 20:11.112
we're finished
with the introductions.

20:11.512 --> 20:13.780
You're very acquainted
with the characters!

20:13.914 --> 20:15.249
-Some we even know in person.
-Really?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.151
- Yes.
- It's a long story.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.219
It is.

20:18.352 --> 20:20.887
But I'll tell it
one of these days.

20:23.557 --> 20:24.824
Hey! Look at Didi.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.793
-She's telling us something.
-Mm-hmm.

20:26.927 --> 20:29.762
Yeah, like, let's wrap
this up. It's killing me.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.967
Well, then, let's begin.

20:40.107 --> 20:43.010
<i>Oh, no! Poor Didi!
She feels sick.</i>

20:43.144 --> 20:45.246
<i>Ugh. The blueberries
must've been poisonous!</i>

20:45.379 --> 20:48.249
<i>There's no such thing
as poisonous blueberries.</i>

20:48.382 --> 20:49.583
Brrr!

20:53.087 --> 20:54.522
<i>Don't panic.</i>

20:54.654 --> 20:56.157
<i>Her friends
are going to take her to...</i>

20:56.689 --> 20:58.725
<i>Ta-da! Johnny Puff!</i>

20:59.093 --> 21:01.694
<i>- Ma-- -Yes!
-  Keep calm, Didi!</i>

21:01.828 --> 21:03.663
You have to trust your friends!

21:14.841 --> 21:15.775
Ma!

21:15.910 --> 21:18.212
- Ah!
- Hmm?

21:21.081 --> 21:23.951
Hey, Johnny Puff uses
Boy Scout first aid techniques.

21:29.123 --> 21:32.293
-Aah!
-But Didi still has
a bellyache.

21:33.394 --> 21:35.029
Unless she was faking it.

21:36.530 --> 21:38.765
Hmm?

21:39.333 --> 21:40.935
Hmm? Huh?

21:43.137 --> 21:46.240
You didn't wake me up like that
when I fainted, did you?

21:46.373 --> 21:47.707
No. You got lucky.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.577
Frankie boy here stopped me.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.485
-Whoa!
-Aah!

21:59.119 --> 22:01.455
Oh, no. There's nothing
more that can be done.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.024
Poor Didi.

22:05.526 --> 22:07.827
<i>Wait! Johnny Puff
has a plan.</i>

22:14.101 --> 22:16.203
<i>- What's that?
- A giant syringe!</i>

22:16.337 --> 22:18.838
No! It's an alien brain-sucker.

22:18.973 --> 22:20.274
Or a phony-baloney meter,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.209
which we could use
right about now.

22:25.613 --> 22:28.582
<i>Hurray! She got better
all on her own!</i>

22:29.250 --> 22:32.152
Or maybe she never
got sick in the first place.

22:33.320 --> 22:34.989
Mm-hmm.

22:43.597 --> 22:44.764
Aah!

22:44.897 --> 22:46.766
Ooh!

22:47.568 --> 22:48.469
The end.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.140
Thank God.

22:55.142 --> 22:57.578
Oh, I've got a bellyache too.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.680
Maybe I ate too much popcorn.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.181
Oh, no.

23:03.883 --> 23:04.952
Hey, hey.

23:05.085 --> 23:06.453
What are you doing with the kid?

23:07.721 --> 23:08.855
Hands off him.

23:08.989 --> 23:09.990
Wow! All better.

23:10.124 --> 23:11.759
How did you do that?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.528
I, I don't know actually.

23:15.229 --> 23:17.897
Hey, did you change your hair?

23:18.032 --> 23:19.733
It looks different.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.969
- Uh, me? No, why? No.
- Well...

23:22.102 --> 23:23.904
Thank you.

23:24.038 --> 23:25.372
Magic! What did I tell you?

23:25.506 --> 23:27.041
- You're a--
- A doctor! It's obvious!

23:27.174 --> 23:28.442
Look, Olivia,
I'll prove it to you!

23:28.575 --> 23:30.177
Maybe you can give
someone a quick check-up,

23:30.311 --> 23:31.979
-something will click.
-Oh, yes!

23:32.112 --> 23:33.547
-And your memory will come back.
-Oh, yes.

23:33.681 --> 23:34.814
What?

23:34.948 --> 23:35.949
Examine me, please.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.251
-Okay.
-Whoa, whoa,

23:37.384 --> 23:39.753
Where you going
with that, sister?

23:40.254 --> 23:42.289
Tony, maybe I'm a doctor.

23:43.424 --> 23:44.658
A doctor, huh?

23:44.792 --> 23:46.393
Give her a chance, Tony.

23:46.927 --> 23:47.827
For real?

23:47.961 --> 23:49.229
Yeah.

23:50.397 --> 23:51.699
Your funeral.

23:52.366 --> 23:53.767
-Okay.
-Okay, here we go.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.835
Let me try.

23:55.969 --> 23:57.071
Alright.

23:57.204 --> 23:58.272
Ow! I'm sorry!

23:58.405 --> 23:59.640
-I'll help...
-Oh, oh, gosh.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.308
-I'm sorry.
-Some doctor.

24:01.442 --> 24:04.011
I'll bet she just won the Nobel
prize in medicine. Huh?

24:04.144 --> 24:06.547
Frank, can we chat
in private, please?

24:06.680 --> 24:09.283
Uncle Tony, can you
give me more lemonade?

24:09.416 --> 24:11.919
- Sure thing, kid.
- Oh, for me too, please.

24:12.052 --> 24:13.954
I'd like something
to sweeten me up.

24:14.355 --> 24:15.956
What do I look like, a butler?

24:16.724 --> 24:18.926
Maybe you're not a doctor,
but you were terrific.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.527
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Really?

24:20.661 --> 24:21.894
Thank you, Liam.

24:22.029 --> 24:24.298
But there's a little voice
inside of me

24:24.431 --> 24:26.600
that keeps saying that
I have to do something,

24:26.734 --> 24:27.935
but I can't remember what.

24:28.068 --> 24:29.837
A little voice inside my head

24:29.970 --> 24:31.905
tells me you need to get lost.

24:32.039 --> 24:34.708
Hey, uncle Tony.
Lemonade! Chop-chop!

24:35.309 --> 24:37.144
-Frank!
-Okay! God...

24:37.277 --> 24:40.447
- darn it!
- That's right. Show.

24:41.949 --> 24:43.417
Get in here.

24:48.222 --> 24:49.456
I figured out who she is.

24:49.590 --> 24:51.558
- Great! Let's go tell her.
- Wait.

24:52.459 --> 24:55.095
-She's a swindler.
-Oh.

24:55.462 --> 24:58.165
You mean like Didi
who wasn't really sick?

24:58.732 --> 25:00.401
That, that's exactly right!

25:00.534 --> 25:03.103
Look, the clues in the book
are crystal clear!

25:03.237 --> 25:05.806
This babe is pretending
that she lost her memory.

25:05.939 --> 25:07.408
And she's playing it
all cute with us.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.243
So she can win us over
and then...

25:09.376 --> 25:11.078
...stab us in the back!

25:11.211 --> 25:13.280
I don't like
back-stabbers one bit!

25:13.981 --> 25:15.082
Yeah, well, trust me,

25:15.649 --> 25:18.018
we lookouts, we got
pretty good instincts

25:18.152 --> 25:19.720
about these things.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.355
Really?

25:23.257 --> 25:24.725
We got no signal.

25:24.858 --> 25:26.360
Nothing. No reception.

25:27.594 --> 25:30.497
Sir, could we use
your cell phone

25:30.631 --> 25:32.266
as you have signal?

25:33.500 --> 25:36.036
Just so long as you don't
break it too.

25:36.603 --> 25:37.704
Thanks.

25:41.775 --> 25:43.010
Yeah, we need an ambulance.

25:43.143 --> 25:45.813
We've had an accident. What?

25:45.946 --> 25:47.948
There's an order
of gingerbread men

25:48.081 --> 25:49.716
that needs to be paid for.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.419
How much? Listen, I'm sorry.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.254
I think I must have
dialed the wrong number.

25:54.388 --> 25:56.290
I, I don't even like
gingerbread.

25:56.824 --> 25:57.958
-That was weird.
-Let me try.

25:58.091 --> 25:59.326
Let me try it.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.161
- 911.
- Yeah.

26:03.030 --> 26:04.933
Hello. I'm Emma Wallace,

26:05.065 --> 26:07.000
and we've had an accident.

26:07.701 --> 26:08.602
What?

26:09.136 --> 26:11.004
What do I care if red on green

26:11.138 --> 26:13.574
looks better than green on red?

26:14.575 --> 26:15.542
No.

26:18.979 --> 26:22.115
I've told you a thousand times.
Red on green is perfect.

26:22.249 --> 26:24.551
Even if not everybody
agrees with me.

26:25.118 --> 26:27.187
So, any news?

26:28.322 --> 26:30.858
She should be here by now.

26:31.391 --> 26:33.260
I'll believe it when I see her.

26:42.169 --> 26:45.472
Do you, do you need some help?

26:46.673 --> 26:48.509
Oh, I can do it on my own.

26:48.642 --> 26:50.177
I always have.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.281
Here you go.

26:56.884 --> 26:59.052
Oh! Oh, it's sour!

26:59.186 --> 27:01.321
-What?
-It's gross!

27:01.455 --> 27:02.689
You know, she seems
pretty honest

27:02.823 --> 27:04.591
for a lady that's playing
all sweet and cute

27:04.725 --> 27:06.193
just so she can
stab us in the back.

27:06.326 --> 27:08.228
If you ask me, it's good.

27:08.595 --> 27:09.663
Delicious.

27:11.565 --> 27:13.600
Hey, Tony.
Get our lady friend some sugar.

27:13.734 --> 27:14.434
Yeah.

27:14.568 --> 27:15.937
You can forget about that.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.305
I'm staying right here.

27:23.210 --> 27:24.979
Can you read to us, uncle Tony?

27:25.646 --> 27:27.881
You got it, kiddo.

27:31.518 --> 27:34.187
- Wow!
- Whoa!

27:34.321 --> 27:35.355
It's pretty cool.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.658
Pie's telling us
to read this one.

27:42.129 --> 27:44.431
<i>Aren't they cold underwater?</i>

27:44.898 --> 27:46.233
<i>It's a safe.</i>

27:48.735 --> 27:50.537
<i>Hey, you better hope
those little birdies can bring</i>

27:50.671 --> 27:52.873
<i>that all the way to the surface,
and get their hands</i>

27:53.007 --> 27:55.142
on all that cash, huh?

28:13.928 --> 28:15.128
Aah!

28:15.562 --> 28:17.497
<i>Puffins are being spied on!</i>

28:17.631 --> 28:19.700
By Otto!

28:22.235 --> 28:24.404
<i>He's scheming something up.</i>

28:38.352 --> 28:39.753
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

28:40.922 --> 28:44.092
The team. You have to have
faith in yourself, guys.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.459
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

28:53.200 --> 28:54.936
-It's here.
-Oh, thank you.

28:55.069 --> 28:56.470
Speaking of teams.

28:57.571 --> 28:59.139
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:59.272 --> 29:00.942
Go easy on the sugar! Let go--

29:01.075 --> 29:02.576
Give me that!

29:05.512 --> 29:07.115
It's still a little bit
on the sour side,

29:07.247 --> 29:08.682
but good.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.817
Of course she likes
sugar so much because she's--

29:10.952 --> 29:13.453
She has a big sweet tooth.
Come on. Let's see
how the story ends.

29:23.296 --> 29:27.001
So let me get this straight.
The puffins brought
the safe to the surface,

29:27.135 --> 29:29.736
<i>but-- Whoa, whoa!
Be careful down there.</i>

29:36.443 --> 29:38.845
What a catch! I mean,
Otto's got some crew, huh?

29:38.980 --> 29:40.982
<i>All he needs now
is a good lookout, of course.</i>

29:41.115 --> 29:43.850
Uncle Tony, you're not supposed
to cheer for them.

29:43.985 --> 29:44.952
<i>Now what?</i>

29:47.055 --> 29:48.789
Way to go.

29:53.894 --> 29:55.495
<i>Hm, who's going to win the safe?</i>

29:55.629 --> 29:57.564
<i>Come on. Otto, of course.</i>

29:57.698 --> 29:59.133
<i>He's the strongest.</i>

29:59.633 --> 30:02.235
<i>But that's not fair.
He's a thief!</i>

30:03.203 --> 30:04.805
A thief, huh?

30:07.175 --> 30:09.543
<i>Olivia just gave me
a great idea.</i>

30:09.676 --> 30:11.244
<i>What? To open the safe?</i>

30:11.378 --> 30:13.747
<i>because Otto there,
he's having a real tough time.</i>

30:15.649 --> 30:16.817
No.

30:27.627 --> 30:29.362
And the safe is open.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.832
Oh, boy. There's nothing
inside though.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.767
Enough with that.

30:38.371 --> 30:39.806
You can go now.

30:40.373 --> 30:42.242
-Hmm.
-Hey, uncle Tony.

30:42.576 --> 30:44.611
Can you give us
some more lemonade?

30:45.278 --> 30:46.147
Please?

30:46.279 --> 30:47.714
Please.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.517
Help yourself.
It's in the kitchen.

30:50.918 --> 30:52.319
Tony had no money.

30:52.452 --> 30:54.222
He was, like,
raised in the streets.

30:54.387 --> 30:55.957
So I said, "Hey..."

30:56.090 --> 30:58.792
Hey, uncle Frank. What do
you say we take advantage

30:58.926 --> 31:01.062
of this little break
and go do some laundry?

31:01.195 --> 31:02.930
We just did laundry, Tony.

31:03.064 --> 31:04.431
In October.

31:04.564 --> 31:05.766
Yeah. It's December.

31:05.899 --> 31:07.901
-That was just two months ago.
-Hm.

31:08.035 --> 31:09.469
What a kidder.

31:09.603 --> 31:10.972
This guy, what a joker, right?

31:11.105 --> 31:13.273
Hey, I'll tell you what,
we'll be right back. Okay?

31:13.406 --> 31:14.741
I mean, in a good long while.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.043
Okay.

31:16.476 --> 31:17.912
And you take whatever
time you need

31:18.045 --> 31:20.280
to do whatever it is
you do, alright?

31:20.413 --> 31:21.615
- Okay.
- Ugh.

31:21.748 --> 31:22.816
- Oh, my gosh.
- Frank?

31:22.950 --> 31:24.484
- Okay. Alright.
- Laundry.

31:24.618 --> 31:25.485
I'll be back.

31:26.988 --> 31:28.089
Um...

31:43.570 --> 31:44.939
She's adorable, right?

31:45.872 --> 31:48.708
So, you want to borrow
some clean underwear?

31:49.010 --> 31:50.144
Gross.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.846
Then why are we doing laundry?

31:54.248 --> 31:55.749
- Hmm.
- Because...

31:55.882 --> 31:57.151
I got a plan.

31:57.285 --> 31:58.618
Okay.

31:59.153 --> 32:00.922
-I'll explain.
-Okay.

32:04.791 --> 32:07.394
-Oh, geez!
-What are you doing?

32:08.229 --> 32:09.596
Where's all the laundry?

32:10.198 --> 32:13.201
Please. That was the excuse
to set my trap.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.769
You saw what Otto did,
right, huh?

32:16.037 --> 32:17.905
-He opened the safe.
-No, no, no, no.

32:18.039 --> 32:19.273
Before that. Before that!

32:19.406 --> 32:20.740
He tried to steal it.

32:20.874 --> 32:22.977
Don't you get it? He's a thief.
That's the clue.

32:23.110 --> 32:25.980
He's a thief.
She's a thief. Got it?

32:27.315 --> 32:29.416
Nobody steals on Christmas Eve.

32:30.318 --> 32:33.353
-Frank.
-Okay. Okay.

32:33.486 --> 32:35.122
Anyway. Listen.

32:35.256 --> 32:36.790
I set the bait.

32:38.326 --> 32:41.128
Now we're going to see
if she takes a nibble.

32:49.502 --> 32:51.005
I knew it. I knew it!

32:51.138 --> 32:52.873
- Caught red-handed. Yes!
- Oh! What?

32:53.007 --> 32:55.309
You knew it. Caught red-handed.
Caught red-handed!

32:55.442 --> 32:56.476
You're out of this!

32:56.610 --> 32:57.744
You're out of this house!

32:57.878 --> 32:59.313
-Right out of here!
-Why?

32:59.446 --> 33:00.680
Because we know who you are.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.482
-Honey, we know who you are.
-Who am I?

33:02.616 --> 33:03.951
You're a thief!

33:04.085 --> 33:05.152
-A thief?
-Yeah.

33:05.286 --> 33:06.553
But I didn't steal anything.

33:06.686 --> 33:07.621
How about my wallet
that was right there

33:07.754 --> 33:09.056
about two minutes ago? Huh, huh?

33:09.190 --> 33:10.258
Oh.

33:10.523 --> 33:13.127
Well, isn't it there
in your pocket?

33:16.563 --> 33:18.899
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

33:19.499 --> 33:20.901
How did you do that?

33:21.035 --> 33:22.336
I don't know.

33:22.469 --> 33:23.803
Don't ever

33:23.938 --> 33:27.341
question this honorable
woman's integrity again.

33:27.474 --> 33:29.709
Oh, Frankie-boy,
thank you so much!

33:29.843 --> 33:33.147
You're a constant source
of trust and hope.

33:33.281 --> 33:34.881
-I know. I know.
-Oh.

33:35.249 --> 33:38.252
But, but the truth is, I feel
I'm doing everything wrong,

33:38.386 --> 33:40.388
you know, I, I feel
I'm in the wrong place.

33:40.520 --> 33:42.189
-I should be somewhere else.
-Stop.

33:42.924 --> 33:45.725
You are kind. You're clever.

33:45.859 --> 33:48.728
Whoever you are,
whatever you do, it's amazing.

33:48.862 --> 33:51.198
I can't take this.
Please. You can't expect me--

33:51.332 --> 33:53.500
You know what? We're going
to finish reading this book,

33:53.633 --> 33:55.602
so you can get on to
your urgent commitments.

33:55.735 --> 33:57.071
Kids! Enough lemonade. Come on!

33:57.204 --> 33:59.006
Uncle Frank's going to read
another story.

33:59.140 --> 34:00.374
Sorry about that.

34:00.740 --> 34:03.344
He's just crabby
because he doesn't have
any clean underwear.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.744
Oh.

34:05.980 --> 34:08.149
How many presents are there?

34:08.983 --> 34:09.816
You do the math.

34:09.951 --> 34:11.851
At least one for every child.

34:11.986 --> 34:15.522
- And they wonder why
I always have a backache.

34:16.756 --> 34:18.025
He's a bit nuts.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.994
But I don't think
he's dangerous.

34:20.127 --> 34:21.828
I don't think he's nuts.

34:29.270 --> 34:30.704
Tony, join us.

34:30.837 --> 34:32.907
I'm about to read another story.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.042
Oh, I can't wait.

34:36.010 --> 34:38.645
But the question is, which one?

34:39.146 --> 34:41.315
Wow!

34:41.449 --> 34:42.350
Pretty cool.

34:42.482 --> 34:43.850
Tac decided for us!

34:43.985 --> 34:46.253
This book keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

34:47.587 --> 34:50.657
<i>- What a great balloon!
- I wonder who it belongs to.</i>

34:50.790 --> 34:52.759
To Tac and the others
who are following him!

35:00.468 --> 35:01.402
And like all beautiful things

35:01.534 --> 35:03.204
in life, sooner or later...

35:03.337 --> 35:04.771
Boom!

35:05.906 --> 35:07.274
Oh.

35:20.653 --> 35:21.922
Way to go, puffins!

35:22.490 --> 35:24.258
Ah, aah.

35:33.733 --> 35:34.567
Hey!

35:45.046 --> 35:47.181
Hey, Otto's the one
handing out the balloons.

35:50.717 --> 35:52.186
I told you he's a good guy.

35:52.319 --> 35:54.721
Good guy? What're you talking
about? It's a swindle!

35:54.854 --> 35:56.924
I don't see how the story
of a double-dealing Walrus

35:57.058 --> 35:59.026
can help me figure out who I am.

35:59.626 --> 36:00.461
Well, I do.

36:12.073 --> 36:14.475
It's a trap!
Otto's doing everything he can

36:14.607 --> 36:16.709
to lure the Puffins
into his den.

36:17.511 --> 36:19.180
<i>And he's pulling it off.</i>

36:19.313 --> 36:20.414
<i>Oh, no! Don't go in!</i>

36:20.548 --> 36:21.681
It's dangerous!

36:21.815 --> 36:22.849
<i>This time</i>

36:22.983 --> 36:24.952
<i>Otto is really close to winning.</i>

36:30.324 --> 36:32.692
Well, all good plans
have a weakness.

36:32.826 --> 36:35.262
Or somebody who's
too smart to fall for it.

36:35.396 --> 36:38.265
<i>You're right, uncle Tony!
It serves you right, Otto!</i>

36:38.399 --> 36:39.333
<i>Good teamwork.</i>

36:41.235 --> 36:42.002
What is going on?

36:43.736 --> 36:45.906
Uncle Frank!
It's Otto's balloon.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.640
-Thank you, Puffins.
-Give me that thing.

36:47.774 --> 36:49.944
Hey, kids. Who wants a balloon,
huh? Come play with it.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.711
- Who wants the big red balloon?
- Me!

36:51.845 --> 36:53.180
Come and get it!

36:53.813 --> 36:56.016
-Go fetch.
-Ah.

36:56.150 --> 36:58.319
- I got it!
- Frank?
Step into my office.

36:58.852 --> 37:01.122
- Uh, I can't wait to hear
what uncle Tony thinks...

37:01.255 --> 37:03.890
- ...this clue means. We're up!
- Let me, let me see!

37:04.024 --> 37:06.093
No! It's mine!

37:06.594 --> 37:07.928
-No!
-Give me that!

37:08.062 --> 37:10.231
- Let me see!
- No, it's mine!

37:10.364 --> 37:11.999
No!

37:13.900 --> 37:15.503
No!

37:15.635 --> 37:17.204
Goodbye, balloon.

37:26.981 --> 37:28.315
Thank you, thank you.

37:28.449 --> 37:30.417
You were there,
and then you were here.

37:30.551 --> 37:31.919
How did you do that?

37:32.419 --> 37:34.255
- I don't know.
- Hyper-speed!

37:34.388 --> 37:36.090
With all the gifts
they have to deliver,

37:36.223 --> 37:37.591
it's an important skill...

37:37.724 --> 37:39.960
No! I get it.
You work in a circus!

37:40.427 --> 37:42.795
Let's see if any circuses
in town have lost an acrobat.

37:42.930 --> 37:44.764
-Maybe we can use the phone.
-Good idea.

37:44.898 --> 37:47.067
Go for it!

37:47.901 --> 37:49.136
I'm so sorry.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.510
Frank, the book tells the story.

37:56.644 --> 37:57.810
She's definitely a kidnapper.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.246
We got to get rid of her.

38:00.014 --> 38:01.248
She's not a kidnapper.

38:01.649 --> 38:04.351
Have you seen her face?
She wouldn't harm a fly.

38:04.485 --> 38:06.153
Did you fall for that? Come on.

38:06.287 --> 38:08.422
You know the angel faces
are the most evil.

38:08.556 --> 38:11.058
Take a look at yours truly.

38:13.227 --> 38:14.861
Okay, we can't
kick her out without proof.

38:14.995 --> 38:16.763
Trust me. I got a plan.

38:16.896 --> 38:18.232
Oh, you do...

38:23.237 --> 38:25.573
What's your plan? We can't leave
the kids out there

38:25.705 --> 38:27.007
with a potential kidnapper.

38:27.141 --> 38:29.543
That is the plan.
We leave her with the kids,

38:29.677 --> 38:30.911
she tries to kidnap them, boom.

38:31.045 --> 38:32.712
We have all the proof we need.

38:33.547 --> 38:35.782
Well, what if she actually
kidnaps them?

38:35.916 --> 38:37.784
Please, one false move,

38:37.918 --> 38:39.620
I'll knock her into next week.

38:39.752 --> 38:40.988
Now we just sit and wait.

38:41.121 --> 38:43.490
Right? Just like
the good old days

38:43.624 --> 38:45.159
when I used to be lookout.

38:45.292 --> 38:47.094
Yeah.

38:47.228 --> 38:49.496
You know, hey, I got an idea.
Vince gets out,

38:49.630 --> 38:51.999
we get the boys in the band
back together, boom.

38:52.132 --> 38:54.568
-I miss Vince, yeah.
That'd be nice.
-Hm.

38:54.702 --> 38:56.270
Or if we do get arrested,

38:56.403 --> 38:59.073
-then we could end up
with Vince in the jail.
-Hm.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.208
I like plan A.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.844
Waiting right here.

39:05.412 --> 39:07.581
Okay, we've waited long enough.
Let's go!

39:07.715 --> 39:08.815
Hey!

39:09.683 --> 39:12.019
-Gone.
-What did I tell you?

39:12.152 --> 39:14.588
She waited for a moment
of chaos, boom.

39:14.722 --> 39:16.090
She kidnapped the kids.

39:17.124 --> 39:20.160
Oh, no. Oh, no,
I got to call my brother.

39:20.561 --> 39:21.962
He's going to be so mad.

39:22.529 --> 39:24.031
Just like I told you.

39:24.164 --> 39:26.700
The angel faces are always
the most evil.

39:27.434 --> 39:29.303
Okay, what?
It's going to be a long time

39:29.436 --> 39:31.438
-before he trusts us
to babysit again.
-I'll say.

39:33.474 --> 39:34.807
His phone's out of range!

39:35.542 --> 39:36.944
Where do you think
she took them?

39:38.345 --> 39:39.680
How could all of those presents

39:39.812 --> 39:41.548
possibly fit in this sack?

39:43.651 --> 39:45.719
It's getting late though, huh?
We better go.

39:45.852 --> 39:48.355
Oh, she's not going to make it.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.457
I'll never manage to deliver

39:50.591 --> 39:53.093
two billion two hundred
and thirty-four million

39:53.227 --> 39:55.029
three hundred
and fifty-nine thousand

39:55.162 --> 39:57.031
five hundred and thirteen...

39:57.164 --> 39:59.233
...five hundred and fourteen.

39:59.933 --> 40:03.270
A baby was just born.

40:03.737 --> 40:05.005
Should we offer him a ride?

40:05.139 --> 40:06.540
And the reindeer?

40:06.974 --> 40:09.109
I'll call a patrol car
when we get to town.

40:09.243 --> 40:10.611
They should be able
to take care of it.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.845
Would you like a ride, sir?

40:13.347 --> 40:14.381
Uh...

40:15.049 --> 40:16.383
Geez, in all the confusion,

40:16.517 --> 40:18.485
we didn't even
introduce ourselves.

40:18.885 --> 40:20.654
I'm Pete. Pete Wallace.

40:20.788 --> 40:22.356
This is my wife Emma.

40:22.489 --> 40:23.524
Nice to meet you.

40:24.824 --> 40:25.726
You are?

40:26.427 --> 40:28.762
You know exactly who I am.

40:29.196 --> 40:31.498
Even though you don't
believe in me anymore.

40:31.632 --> 40:33.067
And that's a real shame.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.270
For instance, have you ever
asked yourself

40:36.403 --> 40:38.838
why you buy all these presents?

40:38.972 --> 40:42.276
I take care of that.
Hasn't that sunk in?

40:44.712 --> 40:46.380
I'm usually all "Ho ho ho!"

40:46.513 --> 40:48.782
But you have to understand,

40:48.916 --> 40:52.086
this, the situation is
a little more than dramatic.

40:52.219 --> 40:54.054
We'll give you a ride.

40:54.588 --> 40:57.324
-I expected it to be heavier.
-Yeah?

40:58.058 --> 40:59.693
She hasn't shown up yet.

41:00.527 --> 41:03.263
What do you mean you don't know
where she is anymore?

41:03.564 --> 41:04.631
I knew it.

41:05.165 --> 41:06.600
Can't trust anybody.

41:12.039 --> 41:13.173
-Oh, oh!
-Hey, wait!

41:13.307 --> 41:14.942
Stop the car! Ahh!

41:17.077 --> 41:18.545
Come on.
You'll flood the engine!

41:18.679 --> 41:20.114
- Get out of the car!
- I knew it.

41:20.247 --> 41:22.449
No car is as good as a sleigh.

41:22.983 --> 41:24.418
Oh! You're here!

41:24.952 --> 41:27.187
Thank you. Mwah! Oh!

41:27.488 --> 41:28.489
Yes. Why?

41:28.622 --> 41:30.524
There's nothing
to play with over there.

41:31.091 --> 41:32.393
And all of a sudden
we were here.

41:32.526 --> 41:34.995
Next to this.
How did we do that?

41:35.129 --> 41:37.164
-Magic! What did I tell you?
-Mm-hmm.

41:37.297 --> 41:38.832
Well, if you are a magician,

41:38.966 --> 41:40.801
maybe you can fix
my lucky ski mask.

41:40.934 --> 41:43.737
- This is my mask.
- She's not a magician.

41:43.871 --> 41:46.874
That's what I'm trying
to tell you! She's an elf!

41:47.007 --> 41:49.977
I didn't hear nobody move.
How's that?

41:50.110 --> 41:51.645
Maybe you need a hearing aid.

41:52.946 --> 41:53.981
I see perfect.

41:54.481 --> 41:55.883
That's why I'm the best
in the business.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.218
Oh, if you can see so well,

41:58.919 --> 42:00.454
then you can read this to us.

42:00.587 --> 42:02.623
Yay!

42:06.627 --> 42:09.029
Hey, get lost!
Out of here, okay?

42:09.163 --> 42:10.964
I choose the story.

42:12.666 --> 42:15.068
Okay! I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

42:15.602 --> 42:17.938
I guess we'll go
with this one here.

42:31.318 --> 42:33.787
Tic wants to show us
what a great magician he is!

42:33.922 --> 42:36.623
That trick could help us with
our Christmas dinner problem.

42:36.757 --> 42:38.192
Our refrigerator is empty.

42:45.432 --> 42:46.467
Ah-ha!

43:18.732 --> 43:20.734
And now he'll need
another volunteer.

43:21.134 --> 43:22.336
Me! Me!

43:22.469 --> 43:25.172
No! Let's see what happens.

43:25.305 --> 43:27.909
<i>Vanished! Way to go, Tic!</i>

43:28.442 --> 43:29.944
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

43:30.477 --> 43:32.312
<i>Tac's not coming back anymore!</i>

43:32.446 --> 43:35.883
Tic, don't mess around.
Make him come back!

43:36.350 --> 43:37.784
<i>Don't worry, Olivia.</i>

43:37.919 --> 43:41.255
<i>Didi and Pie
will make Tac reappear!</i>

44:05.279 --> 44:08.315
<i>Looks like Didi disappeared too.</i>

44:09.449 --> 44:11.752
<i>Pie, you're our last hope!</i>

44:22.095 --> 44:23.564
Aah!

44:39.047 --> 44:41.081
Now what? The Puffins
are going to need help

44:41.214 --> 44:42.349
from a real magician!

44:42.482 --> 44:43.750
Me?

44:44.484 --> 44:46.620
Yes. You have to use your magic.

44:46.753 --> 44:48.288
You only need
to remember that you're--

44:48.422 --> 44:51.291
-A Magician! Great idea, Olivia!
-No, I said an--

44:51.425 --> 44:52.726
This will explain how suddenly

44:52.859 --> 44:55.095
we found ourselves
in the bedroom

44:55.228 --> 44:56.363
without us even noticing!

44:56.496 --> 44:57.831
If she's a magician,

44:57.966 --> 44:59.833
then maybe she can pull
a disappearing act.

44:59.968 --> 45:01.401
Yes!

45:02.169 --> 45:04.304
I'm sorry
to disturb you so much.

45:04.438 --> 45:06.340
-Yeah.
-You know,
maybe I should just go.

45:06.473 --> 45:08.943
No, no, no. Don't listen to him.

45:09.476 --> 45:11.345
Let's see how the story ends.

45:21.521 --> 45:23.624
Tic called Johnny Puff!
Poor guy.

45:23.757 --> 45:25.425
We have to trust Johnny Puff.

45:25.559 --> 45:27.461
He'll make everything right.

45:47.714 --> 45:48.849
Ha!

45:52.586 --> 45:54.989
<i>Well, they're safe and sound.</i>

45:55.389 --> 45:57.791
Oh, boy. You feel
any calmer, Tony?

45:57.925 --> 45:59.559
I'm not buying it.

46:01.062 --> 46:04.498
Johnny Puff
is going to do a magic act.

46:12.907 --> 46:14.307
Oh.

46:19.413 --> 46:20.747
I think it's a raid!

46:20.881 --> 46:22.616
We got to get out of here!
Come on, Olivia.

46:23.151 --> 46:24.284
Where we going?

46:24.851 --> 46:27.654
To our secret escape tunnel.
Right in here.

46:27.788 --> 46:29.389
Cool.

46:30.024 --> 46:31.391
Right in here.

46:33.061 --> 46:34.828
Alright, I'm innocent.

46:34.962 --> 46:36.563
- Oh.
- Um...

46:37.497 --> 46:39.466
Oh, there's no cops.
There's no cops.

46:39.599 --> 46:41.401
What, what are
you doing with that...

46:42.235 --> 46:43.336
...box of skinny clothes?

46:43.905 --> 46:45.739
I figure that if she's
really a magician,

46:45.872 --> 46:47.240
performing a trick
could help her

46:47.374 --> 46:49.110
click her memory back
into action.

46:49.242 --> 46:51.145
That's solid thinking
there, son.

46:51.545 --> 46:52.546
-You know--
-You go in here.

46:52.679 --> 46:53.580
- In there?
- Yeah.

46:53.714 --> 46:54.614
You go in there.

46:55.315 --> 46:56.750
Disappear if you can.

46:57.217 --> 46:58.652
Then we'll know.

46:59.453 --> 47:00.687
- Oh!
- Okay, easy!

47:00.821 --> 47:01.923
- Okay.
- Slowly, I'm--

47:02.422 --> 47:04.725
Alright. Are you still in there?

47:04.858 --> 47:06.326
- I'm stuck!
- Now what?

47:06.460 --> 47:09.629
When you open this,
if she's gone,

47:10.263 --> 47:11.531
she's a magician.

47:11.665 --> 47:14.668
But if she's here,
she's not a magician.

47:14.801 --> 47:18.206
- Ah, okay.
- Hey, careful.
Slow, slow, slow.

47:18.906 --> 47:20.540
-What's the verdict?
-She's stuck.

47:20.674 --> 47:22.043
- She's stuck? Okay.
- She's not a magician.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.477
Okay. Come on out, then.

47:23.610 --> 47:24.946
Oh! Hold up.

47:25.079 --> 47:26.413
Oh, gosh! Oh, my gosh!

47:26.546 --> 47:27.949
There you go! Okay!

47:28.082 --> 47:29.083
-Oh, gosh!
-There.

47:29.217 --> 47:30.784
-Okay, thank you.
-Yeah.

47:30.918 --> 47:33.520
-Oh, my gosh.
-I was stuck. Thank you.

47:36.090 --> 47:38.725
Well, the battery seems okay,
so, um...

47:39.426 --> 47:41.428
I don't know.
Maybe it's the sparkplugs.

47:41.561 --> 47:43.663
I'll fix it.

47:44.065 --> 47:46.867
Well, don't--
Don't touch anything!

47:47.001 --> 47:49.070
You see?

47:49.836 --> 47:51.571
Do you know anything
about engines?

47:51.705 --> 47:53.273
I know a lot about reindeer.

47:53.406 --> 47:54.775
Exactly.

47:55.675 --> 47:58.345
I need a sparkplug wrench.

48:02.582 --> 48:04.218
Merry Christmas!

48:04.351 --> 48:05.619
Seriously?

48:09.790 --> 48:11.892
Ah, you got to be kidding me.

48:14.996 --> 48:16.797
If you got a torch down there
as well, that'd be great.

48:16.931 --> 48:19.499
I can't see anything out here.

48:20.134 --> 48:21.936
Merry Christmas again.

48:23.570 --> 48:27.841
Hey! You know, I like Rudolph.

48:29.476 --> 48:30.677
How's it going with the car?

48:30.811 --> 48:32.512
Good.

48:33.346 --> 48:34.614
Great.

48:36.184 --> 48:37.784
You're not a magician.

48:37.919 --> 48:39.053
I guess not.

48:39.586 --> 48:41.655
And you're such an angel,
Frankie boy.

48:44.491 --> 48:47.828
Hey. Why didn't nobody tell us
it was a false alarm, huh?

48:48.095 --> 48:49.696
I thought you were playing
hide and seek.

48:49.830 --> 48:52.099
Uncle Frank, I found these
in the secret passage.

48:52.233 --> 48:55.937
You can wear these instead of
the one that got ripped. Right?

48:56.070 --> 49:00.007
Oh, sure, honey.
But no ski mask will ever

49:00.740 --> 49:02.944
replace my first one, you know.

49:03.410 --> 49:04.678
In my heart.

49:05.980 --> 49:08.149
Thank you, though.

49:08.615 --> 49:10.417
You're welcome.

49:10.550 --> 49:12.419
Oh! Oh...

49:12.920 --> 49:16.456
Oh, my God. I think you're right
about doing laundry. Smell this.

49:17.291 --> 49:19.392
Ooh! Smells like cat piss!

49:21.062 --> 49:22.163
Frank,

49:22.696 --> 49:24.131
you got to get this broad
out of your head.

49:24.265 --> 49:26.633
I told you already.
She isn't interested.

49:28.202 --> 49:29.669
She could be interested.

49:30.137 --> 49:31.471
I have a lot of charisma.

49:31.605 --> 49:33.241
You sure do, Frankie boy.

49:33.640 --> 49:34.708
You're a charmer.

49:35.042 --> 49:36.776
It all makes perfect sense
now actually.

49:36.911 --> 49:38.445
She's pretended to be
cracked in the head

49:38.578 --> 49:40.714
all because she's so
madly in love with you.

49:40.847 --> 49:43.450
-You think so?
-No.

49:44.517 --> 49:46.187
Tell you what.
I'll bet you a dollar,

49:46.320 --> 49:49.723
by the end of the next story,
she asks me out.

49:52.059 --> 49:54.195
-Make it five.
-You got it.

49:54.328 --> 49:55.462
-Deal.
-Yeah.

49:56.230 --> 49:57.430
Got it.

49:57.564 --> 49:59.399
Like taking candy from a baby.

49:59.532 --> 50:00.567
And on our date,

50:01.035 --> 50:03.137
I'm going to wear
my high-school jeans.

50:05.605 --> 50:07.074
She couldn't even get those on.

50:07.607 --> 50:09.609
I'm going to wash them first.

50:09.743 --> 50:11.212
Time to read, kiddies.

50:11.345 --> 50:13.214
Yay!

50:13.347 --> 50:14.614
Because I got a bet to win.

50:16.883 --> 50:18.785
Ooh! Pretty. Ooh.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.553
Hey. This time Johnny Puff

50:20.687 --> 50:22.689
is going to tell us
which story to read.

50:22.822 --> 50:25.359
Hey, maybe this time
we'll figure out

50:25.492 --> 50:26.793
who you really are.

50:27.295 --> 50:28.329
Oh!

50:28.461 --> 50:29.596
Yeah, because so far,

50:29.729 --> 50:30.664
the stories chosen
by the Puffins

50:30.797 --> 50:32.133
haven't told us very much.

50:32.732 --> 50:35.769
Yeah. Still, I was sure
the answer was in there.

50:35.902 --> 50:38.339
But we have to hurry
before it's too late.

50:38.738 --> 50:40.573
Even if I can't
remember for what.

50:40.707 --> 50:42.776
Well, the sooner we read,
the sooner I get my money.

50:42.910 --> 50:45.845
I, I mean, we figure
all this out for you.

50:45.980 --> 50:47.081
Oh.

50:47.214 --> 50:48.548
Yeah.

50:56.656 --> 50:59.492
I wonder what diabolical plan
Otto has in mind this time?

51:02.330 --> 51:03.463
What's that?

51:06.167 --> 51:07.368
A gigantic drill.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.070
-Cool.
-Oh!

51:14.708 --> 51:15.910
It's noisy.

51:16.043 --> 51:19.080
And really smokey. How gross!

51:24.584 --> 51:28.122
<i>Hey, check it out.
It looks like night's falling over Taigasville!</i>

51:28.255 --> 51:30.424
It's not darkness, it's smog!

51:30.590 --> 51:31.558
Really?

51:31.691 --> 51:33.260
Somebody stop Otto!

51:33.394 --> 51:35.930
He's making everything stinky!

51:47.274 --> 51:49.709
Yeah, it looks like
Vince's old apartment.

51:49.843 --> 51:51.312
That was stinky too.

51:51.778 --> 51:53.914
But I bet he wishes
he was there right now.

52:35.822 --> 52:37.824
They're cooking up a plan
to stop Otto.

52:37.958 --> 52:40.094
A gamma ray cannon?
An atomic magnet?

52:40.227 --> 52:41.996
What will they
invent for themselves?

52:42.129 --> 52:45.332
There's the plan!
Using solar panels!

52:45.466 --> 52:46.599
Brilliant idea!

52:46.733 --> 52:47.867
Mm-hmm.

52:58.145 --> 52:59.612
Hm? Oh!

53:10.024 --> 53:11.459
That's not right!

53:11.591 --> 53:12.960
Otto's polluting everything!

53:13.094 --> 53:15.529
What's going on? The smoke
is coming from the book!

53:16.964 --> 53:18.432
Let's go into
the secret passage!

53:26.574 --> 53:28.008
Enough smoke!

53:46.127 --> 53:47.194
Nice.

53:52.866 --> 53:54.701
Olivia! It's all clear!

53:55.402 --> 53:56.470
Olivia!

53:56.937 --> 53:59.173
Yeah, kids, let's go.
We got a...

53:59.806 --> 54:01.774
We got a story to finish.

54:05.980 --> 54:07.680
-Where did all the smoke go?
-Oh, my gosh,

54:07.814 --> 54:09.749
you should've seen it.
It was so smokey--

54:09.883 --> 54:12.920
Frank! Let's do this, shall we?

54:20.928 --> 54:23.297
Here's Johnny Puff!

54:29.802 --> 54:31.305
They went to warn him!

54:31.438 --> 54:33.274
Hey! What's he got going?

54:33.607 --> 54:35.009
He's calling in reinforcements.

54:35.142 --> 54:36.944
Look at all them birdies, huh?

54:40.014 --> 54:42.550
If the Puffins have faith
in Johnny Puff,

54:43.117 --> 54:45.186
then we need
to believe in him too.

54:45.319 --> 54:46.420
Mm-hmm.

54:51.425 --> 54:52.960
Huh?

54:54.128 --> 54:56.197
<i>Oh! Oh, that is so cool!</i>

54:56.330 --> 54:59.033
They're sending all the smoke
back to Otto.

54:59.466 --> 55:00.700
-Good going!
-Yeah!

55:00.833 --> 55:02.002
What goes around comes around!

55:02.136 --> 55:04.104
That's right. I said that too.

55:16.050 --> 55:17.384
Poor puffins!

55:37.404 --> 55:39.940
<i>- Wow!
- Whoa!</i>

55:50.618 --> 55:51.884
The end.

55:52.419 --> 55:55.155
- Hey, Olivia. Let's go play
with the safe.
- Yeah.

55:55.522 --> 55:57.391
Now that's a man
after my own heart.

55:57.524 --> 56:00.728
And in the end, Otto will have
to pay all the damages!

56:00.860 --> 56:01.996
I really like that story.

56:02.129 --> 56:03.664
Justice was served.

56:04.231 --> 56:07.034
Frankie boy knows a thing or two
about serving justice.

56:07.167 --> 56:08.569
I serve a lot of justice.

56:08.702 --> 56:10.337
We must all respect the law.

56:10.471 --> 56:12.872
Oh, I have so much
respect for the law.

56:13.007 --> 56:16.143
Just like Vince.
Looking at five to ten.

56:18.279 --> 56:20.780
You know, sometimes
I respect the law,

56:20.914 --> 56:23.050
and serve justice
at the same time.

56:23.183 --> 56:24.685
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

56:25.319 --> 56:27.454
At this point,
it's hopelessly late.

56:27.588 --> 56:29.590
I knew I shouldn't have
trusted her.

56:29.723 --> 56:31.358
I can't trust anybody.

56:33.961 --> 56:35.396
Not even you.

56:37.731 --> 56:40.100
-A car!
-Hey! Hey!

56:41.535 --> 56:43.070
Hey!

56:43.971 --> 56:44.905
Excuse me.

56:45.039 --> 56:46.106
Good evening, sir.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.408
Our car broke down.

56:47.541 --> 56:49.343
Oh, I'm sorry to hear
about that.

56:49.476 --> 56:52.212
-We just really need a lift.
-Well, I don't know. Hm...

56:52.346 --> 56:54.448
-I don't even know you.
-Can you just give us a--

56:54.581 --> 56:56.583
Horace. You know who I am.

56:56.717 --> 56:58.252
I need your car. Get out.

56:58.885 --> 57:00.853
Hey! Whoa!

57:08.796 --> 57:10.030
Everything will be okay.

57:10.297 --> 57:12.399
I know it.

57:13.900 --> 57:16.869
First, there was my lost badge,
and then Olivia's letter,

57:17.004 --> 57:18.672
and now this crazy guy.

57:18.806 --> 57:21.375
And we're going to be
spending Christmas eve

57:21.508 --> 57:23.711
without our children again
this year.

57:38.158 --> 57:41.562
Hey. Was there something
you forgot to ask me?

57:42.162 --> 57:44.064
No. I, I don't think so.

57:44.198 --> 57:46.333
Something, uh, we were
going to do together?

57:46.467 --> 57:47.534
It was your idea?

57:47.668 --> 57:48.702
No. No.

57:48.836 --> 57:50.537
I don't think so. No.

57:52.439 --> 57:53.640
Like I said,

57:53.774 --> 57:56.443
taking candy from a baby.

57:56.577 --> 57:57.378
It's chocolate!

57:57.511 --> 57:59.179
Uncle Tony, can I have one too?

57:59.646 --> 58:01.081
Sure thing, kid.

58:01.215 --> 58:03.283
-Hey, can I have one too?
-Sure, kid.

58:03.417 --> 58:04.585
Thanks!

58:05.018 --> 58:06.019
Hey, can I have some more?

58:06.153 --> 58:08.122
There are no more in the house.

58:08.255 --> 58:12.226
I hid some under the eaves
so Tony wouldn't find them.

58:13.327 --> 58:15.295
Hey! Save some for me too, okay?

58:15.429 --> 58:16.630
Okay!

58:17.064 --> 58:19.032
Did you remember
what you wanted to ask me?

58:19.566 --> 58:20.234
Actually, I do.

58:20.367 --> 58:22.569
I'd love some sweets!

58:23.170 --> 58:24.872
- Some sweets.
- Mm-hmm.

58:25.472 --> 58:28.776
-There you go.
-No. More sweets.
Lots of sweets.

58:29.209 --> 58:30.577
That ought to take care of it.

58:31.445 --> 58:33.046
Tell you what we're going to do.
I'm going to go in the kitchen

58:33.180 --> 58:34.515
with Frankie boy here,

58:34.648 --> 58:35.849
and we're going to make you
a peanut butter

58:35.983 --> 58:37.818
and sugar sandwich

58:37.951 --> 58:39.153
with so much sugar on it

58:39.286 --> 58:40.754
it's going to look
like a volcano.

58:40.888 --> 58:42.089
Yes! Yes! Thanks!

58:42.222 --> 58:43.490
-I'd love that.
-Uncle Frankie and I

58:43.624 --> 58:44.958
will take care of that
for you right now,

58:45.092 --> 58:46.860
isn't that right, Frankie?

58:47.294 --> 58:48.962
Peanut butter
and sugar sandwiches

58:49.096 --> 58:50.497
are my specialty.

58:51.098 --> 58:53.233
- Oh, Frankie.
- Yeah. Well,

58:53.367 --> 58:54.535
-I love...
-Frank!

58:54.668 --> 58:56.804
You still owe me five bucks!

58:56.937 --> 58:58.105
Let's go.

58:58.238 --> 59:00.574
-Can I take a look at your book?
-Sure.

59:40.013 --> 59:41.415
Maybe you're a firewoman.

59:41.849 --> 59:44.418
You were the one who opened
the window somehow, right?

59:45.052 --> 59:46.019
No.

59:46.153 --> 59:47.888
I don't, I don't know.

59:48.422 --> 59:52.426
I just opened the window because
I thought it would be useful
to get the smoke out, but--

59:52.559 --> 59:53.928
Oh! Careful!

59:54.061 --> 59:55.896
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

59:56.463 --> 59:58.933
Alright, little by little,
we'll figure out who you are.

59:59.066 --> 1:00:01.869
You have to be patient.
That's what my dad always says.

1:00:02.236 --> 1:00:04.571
Patient. I wish.

1:00:05.038 --> 1:00:06.640
I'm full of anxiety.

1:00:07.274 --> 1:00:09.109
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:00:09.710 --> 1:00:11.778
It's good for me
to be here with you

1:00:11.913 --> 1:00:16.850
and all the others, and even
that old grumble-guts of Tony.

1:00:16.985 --> 1:00:18.418
But I have to do something.

1:00:18.552 --> 1:00:21.021
I really feel
I have to do something.

1:00:29.363 --> 1:00:31.732
She's definitely strange.

1:00:31.865 --> 1:00:34.434
She cured my bellyache
without medicine.

1:00:35.068 --> 1:00:36.036
Somehow,

1:00:36.737 --> 1:00:39.139
she moved me and Olivia
from the living room

1:00:39.606 --> 1:00:41.976
to the bedroom
without us even noticing.

1:00:42.911 --> 1:00:45.679
And now, she opened
the windows with her mind.

1:00:47.648 --> 1:00:48.615
Who is she?

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:51.118
She says the answer
is in the book.

1:00:51.251 --> 1:00:52.653
But where?

1:00:54.521 --> 1:00:57.357
Didi, I already read that story.

1:00:59.192 --> 1:01:00.962
I need to look
for clues that can...

1:01:01.395 --> 1:01:03.497
Ah! I got it!

1:01:03.630 --> 1:01:05.499
The "S" that starts the story.

1:01:06.968 --> 1:01:08.201
"S"?

1:01:09.570 --> 1:01:12.839
That means the letters
themselves are the clues!

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:15.742
Okay. Tell me
who she is already.

1:01:16.209 --> 1:01:19.379
You saw how pissed she got
because of the way Otto
treated the Puffins.

1:01:19.914 --> 1:01:20.982
So what?

1:01:21.381 --> 1:01:23.417
It's obvious she's a cop, right?

1:01:23.550 --> 1:01:25.752
She's here to make sure
we're on our best behavior!

1:01:25.886 --> 1:01:28.789
Otherwise, how would
she know the names of
Olivia and Liam, huh?

1:01:29.222 --> 1:01:32.292
And that explains why she's
being playing cutesy with you!

1:01:32.426 --> 1:01:33.962
-Does it?
-Hm.

1:01:34.294 --> 1:01:36.030
Why else would
she flirt with you?

1:01:36.163 --> 1:01:37.497
Now go in there
and be super polite

1:01:37.631 --> 1:01:39.000
and give her anything she wants.

1:01:39.132 --> 1:01:40.601
Alright. I'm going
to go in there,

1:01:40.734 --> 1:01:42.502
and be super polite and give
her anything she wants.

1:01:42.636 --> 1:01:45.105
Perfect! Then she'll put in a
good word with the parole board,

1:01:45.238 --> 1:01:47.541
and we'll finally be done
with all of this.

1:01:47.674 --> 1:01:48.910
Is that it then?

1:01:49.043 --> 1:01:51.812
Is that why you're so sweet
with me, Frankie-boy?

1:01:51.946 --> 1:01:53.982
So, you admit you're a cop, huh?

1:01:54.114 --> 1:01:55.816
I don't know who I am.

1:01:55.950 --> 1:01:56.883
All I know is that

1:01:57.018 --> 1:01:58.752
I don't want to be here anymore.

1:01:58.885 --> 1:02:00.021
There's the door.

1:02:00.955 --> 1:02:03.357
Fine. I'll get my hat,
and then I'll go.

1:02:04.825 --> 1:02:06.293
What about your sandwich?

1:02:07.294 --> 1:02:08.629
-What do you got against cops?
-Hey.

1:02:08.762 --> 1:02:11.032
-My sister in law's a cop!
-Frankie, baby,

1:02:11.164 --> 1:02:12.466
you're getting
soft on me, alright?

1:02:12.599 --> 1:02:14.701
She's a cop. You're going
to get us locked up.

1:02:14.835 --> 1:02:15.902
Come on.

1:02:17.170 --> 1:02:18.472
Get tough.

1:02:28.148 --> 1:02:29.549
Where are you going?

1:02:30.018 --> 1:02:32.219
I'm going away. I'm sorry.

1:02:32.352 --> 1:02:34.821
Well, you can't go away.
You're an--

1:02:34.956 --> 1:02:36.124
No.

1:02:36.256 --> 1:02:38.892
Whatever you think I am,
it's not true.

1:02:39.027 --> 1:02:40.360
I'm a big nothing.

1:02:41.062 --> 1:02:42.696
You're Santa Claus's elf!

1:02:48.036 --> 1:02:49.269
Why are you leaving?

1:02:49.403 --> 1:02:51.438
You promised me
you were going to help me

1:02:51.571 --> 1:02:53.240
figure out who I am.

1:02:53.740 --> 1:02:54.942
I trusted you.

1:02:55.076 --> 1:02:57.744
Instead, you're just like Tony.

1:03:06.386 --> 1:03:07.788
You happy now?

1:03:11.425 --> 1:03:12.826
What a shame.

1:03:45.292 --> 1:03:47.427
Oh, my gosh! Olivia was right!

1:03:49.997 --> 1:03:51.465
Olivia! You were right!

1:03:51.598 --> 1:03:54.068
No. You were right.

1:03:54.202 --> 1:03:56.436
Santa Claus doesn't exist.

1:04:05.645 --> 1:04:08.515
Look at all
that loot, huh?

1:04:08.648 --> 1:04:11.185
You may wind up in the family
business after all.

1:04:13.988 --> 1:04:16.590
Oh, no!

1:04:16.991 --> 1:04:18.025
What's that?

1:04:20.061 --> 1:04:21.461
What happened?
Where's the elf lady?

1:04:21.595 --> 1:04:23.965
Oh, no, don't you
start that too, okay?

1:04:24.098 --> 1:04:25.265
She's gone. Finally.

1:04:25.832 --> 1:04:29.536
This, this is the letter that
Olivia wrote to Santa Claus.

1:04:29.669 --> 1:04:32.639
Oh, no. Daddy must've lost it!

1:04:32.773 --> 1:04:34.341
Uncle Tony, call him right away.

1:04:34.474 --> 1:04:36.144
Meanwhile,
I'll see what she wants.

1:04:36.276 --> 1:04:37.511
I'll give him a ring later.

1:04:38.146 --> 1:04:39.080
It's a disaster.

1:04:39.213 --> 1:04:40.280
Why?

1:04:40.413 --> 1:04:41.448
What am I going to do?

1:04:41.882 --> 1:04:44.085
Olivia can't stop
believing in Christmas.

1:04:44.818 --> 1:04:47.788
-I thought that's what
you wanted.
-Yes.

1:04:48.256 --> 1:04:49.991
But it was a mistake.

1:04:51.291 --> 1:04:52.626
And now I feel guilty.

1:04:53.293 --> 1:04:54.294
You'll get over it.

1:04:54.828 --> 1:04:57.031
Look, uncle Tony,
I don't have time to explain

1:04:57.165 --> 1:04:58.298
it to you, but trust me,

1:04:58.431 --> 1:05:00.867
that woman,
she's Santa Claus's elf.

1:05:02.469 --> 1:05:03.737
You sure about that?

1:05:05.372 --> 1:05:08.542
-Yeah.
-You know, that could explain
all the sugar in the lemonade.

1:05:09.043 --> 1:05:11.012
I hear elves
got some sweet tooth.

1:05:11.145 --> 1:05:13.580
Take this. Find her
and give it to her.

1:05:13.713 --> 1:05:15.283
This way she'll deliver it
to Santa Claus

1:05:15.415 --> 1:05:17.884
-and Olivia can have her gift.
-Kid, kid, kid. Give me a break.

1:05:18.019 --> 1:05:20.353
It's already too late.
It's Christmas eve.

1:05:20.955 --> 1:05:22.455
What do you say
we just stay here

1:05:22.589 --> 1:05:24.891
full of guilt, nice and cozy.

1:05:25.692 --> 1:05:28.628
Please, uncle Tony?

1:05:32.432 --> 1:05:34.734
Who can say no
to a face like that.

1:05:36.603 --> 1:05:38.172
You owe me one, kid.

1:05:38.306 --> 1:05:39.539
Thank you, uncle Tony.

1:05:42.742 --> 1:05:44.444
Ever since you guys ripped this,

1:05:44.878 --> 1:05:46.746
all my good luck has run out.

1:05:49.250 --> 1:05:50.918
Just give me a sign.

1:05:51.384 --> 1:05:54.021
Please give me a sign.
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:05:54.688 --> 1:05:57.959
Oh! Is this a sign?

1:05:58.092 --> 1:05:59.459
No.

1:05:59.593 --> 1:06:01.996
But maybe reading it
will cheer us up a little.

1:06:05.066 --> 1:06:07.901
Hey, where you going?
Come on. Don't do this!

1:06:08.135 --> 1:06:10.071
You're going to go outside,
it's freezing out there.

1:06:10.204 --> 1:06:12.873
-Don't do that.
Come on back upstairs!
-No!

1:06:13.274 --> 1:06:15.009
Hey, listen. I'm sorry, alright?

1:06:15.142 --> 1:06:17.211
I was wrong about you
being a cop.

1:06:17.677 --> 1:06:19.313
You know, and that's
the only reason

1:06:19.446 --> 1:06:21.514
that Frankie's not sweet
on you right now.

1:06:21.648 --> 1:06:22.917
You know? But I can
tell you one thing.

1:06:23.050 --> 1:06:26.620
He thinks you're real,
real special.

1:06:27.454 --> 1:06:29.957
No. I'm a real disaster area.

1:06:30.091 --> 1:06:32.792
That's not true! You're honest.
You're great with kids.

1:06:32.927 --> 1:06:35.562
You, you can cure a bellyache
with just a touch of your hand.

1:06:35.695 --> 1:06:37.831
And you're the world's
greatest fire lady.

1:06:38.232 --> 1:06:41.468
- Those are only coincidences.
- Listen to me.

1:06:41.601 --> 1:06:43.436
I don't know
how much I believe this,

1:06:43.570 --> 1:06:45.505
but Liam told me to tell you

1:06:45.639 --> 1:06:47.540
that you're one
of Santa's elves.

1:06:48.875 --> 1:06:50.410
What are you going on about?

1:06:50.543 --> 1:06:52.380
Now it sounds like
you banged your head.

1:06:52.512 --> 1:06:53.981
I told you I don't know.

1:06:54.115 --> 1:06:55.715
But Liam sure does.

1:06:56.850 --> 1:06:58.718
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

1:06:58.852 --> 1:07:01.155
Hey, he told me
to give you this.

1:07:01.821 --> 1:07:04.424
I don't need it.
I already know what it says.

1:07:05.692 --> 1:07:07.161
How do you know?

1:07:07.661 --> 1:07:08.930
How do I know?

1:07:10.530 --> 1:07:14.402
I know because
I'm one of Santa's elves!

1:07:16.503 --> 1:07:18.906
-Oh!
-Holy smokes!

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:20.374
Liam was right!

1:07:20.507 --> 1:07:22.043
I remember everything now!

1:07:22.509 --> 1:07:26.347
Oh, no, I'm super late!
I have to reach Santa
right now! Right away!

1:07:26.981 --> 1:07:29.083
You wanna borrow my car? I mean,
the clutch is a little sticky,

1:07:29.216 --> 1:07:30.750
but other than that,
it runs pretty well.

1:07:30.884 --> 1:07:33.787
Oh, no, thank you, Tony.
That won't be necessary.

1:07:41.295 --> 1:07:42.662
Don't mention it.

1:07:46.566 --> 1:07:47.867
Wow!

1:07:53.207 --> 1:07:54.175
Ugh!

1:07:55.943 --> 1:07:57.244
Hey.

1:07:58.145 --> 1:08:00.847
-Where you going?
-To deliver my presents.

1:08:00.982 --> 1:08:03.451
Even if it takes
till next Christmas eve.

1:08:03.817 --> 1:08:05.920
And I'll do it by myself
as always.

1:08:06.053 --> 1:08:08.189
You don't trust people
much, do you?

1:08:09.423 --> 1:08:10.857
Why should I?

1:08:11.425 --> 1:08:12.525
Give it a try.

1:08:12.826 --> 1:08:15.495
Your helper. She'll get here.

1:08:16.397 --> 1:08:19.066
For a man your age,
you're awfully naive.

1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:21.568
Maybe if you met her,
you'd understand.

1:08:21.969 --> 1:08:23.237
- Peter?
- Mm?

1:08:23.903 --> 1:08:25.940
I was picking up
my things in the car,

1:08:26.073 --> 1:08:27.208
and...

1:08:27.341 --> 1:08:28.608
Look what I found?

1:08:28.742 --> 1:08:29.977
Hey, your badge.

1:08:30.111 --> 1:08:31.544
My police badge.

1:08:32.380 --> 1:08:33.680
Forgive me.

1:08:35.016 --> 1:08:36.816
Forgive me for everything.

1:08:37.284 --> 1:08:39.786
I need to trust you, instead,
I blamed it all on you,

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:41.755
and all I needed to do
was look a little harder.

1:08:41.888 --> 1:08:43.257
Come here.

1:08:43.790 --> 1:08:46.060
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

1:08:48.795 --> 1:08:49.964
There, you see?

1:08:50.097 --> 1:08:51.198
Trust.

1:08:57.704 --> 1:08:59.173
They had a happy ending.

1:09:02.476 --> 1:09:03.743
At least they did.

1:09:03.978 --> 1:09:05.312
Uncle Frank and Olivia!

1:09:05.446 --> 1:09:07.014
I think you need
to look outside!

1:09:07.148 --> 1:09:09.316
Frank, you got to see
this, baby.

1:09:09.450 --> 1:09:11.285
It's going to blow your mind.

1:09:16.390 --> 1:09:17.891
Wow!

1:09:19.527 --> 1:09:20.894
What'd I tell you?

1:09:23.863 --> 1:09:25.632
-You're real.
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:29.070 --> 1:09:31.972
So, I took off to help Santa
deliver his presents,

1:09:32.106 --> 1:09:35.976
but I smashed
into this huge seagull.

1:09:36.477 --> 1:09:39.846
And I know Santa doesn't
really like me wearing...

1:09:41.015 --> 1:09:42.483
...not being dressed
like an elf,

1:09:42.615 --> 1:09:45.685
but you know, I think
they wear such dorky clothes.

1:09:45.819 --> 1:09:48.089
And I feel much more original.

1:09:48.456 --> 1:09:50.623
Um, where was I? Um, oh, yes.

1:09:50.757 --> 1:09:53.961
So, I, I lost control
during my landing

1:09:54.095 --> 1:09:57.331
and banged my head
real hard against your door.

1:09:57.465 --> 1:09:59.066
How did your memory come back?

1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:02.269
Well, when Tony gave me
Olivia's letter.

1:10:03.270 --> 1:10:07.208
But really, I think
it's feeling your trust in me.

1:10:07.841 --> 1:10:10.978
You know, I've never been
much for self-esteem.

1:10:12.046 --> 1:10:14.949
Eh, that's mostly my fault
I suppose.

1:10:15.715 --> 1:10:16.984
Ugh, I've got to learn

1:10:17.118 --> 1:10:18.919
to stop trying to do
everything by myself

1:10:19.053 --> 1:10:23.756
and start giving you elves
more responsibility!

1:10:24.558 --> 1:10:26.293
I think it's time that I...

1:10:27.061 --> 1:10:32.433
...let you wear this
decorative outfit.

1:10:32.566 --> 1:10:34.335
Thank you! Really.

1:10:34.468 --> 1:10:36.303
So all's well
that ends well, right?

1:10:36.437 --> 1:10:38.139
- And it's all thanks
to this book!

1:10:38.272 --> 1:10:41.342
And more precisely, in the
first letter in each story!

1:10:41.475 --> 1:10:43.843
-You hear that, Frank?
-I did. Our mistake

1:10:43.978 --> 1:10:45.446
was looking for the answers
in the story.

1:10:45.579 --> 1:10:47.881
The Puffins were definitely
trying to help us.

1:10:48.015 --> 1:10:49.749
Yeah, they were.

1:10:49.883 --> 1:10:51.352
Olivia, sweetie.

1:10:51.485 --> 1:10:53.653
How happy are you that
you're going to get your gift

1:10:53.786 --> 1:10:55.822
directly from Santa Claus
this year?

1:10:55.956 --> 1:10:58.092
Oh, he's the real present.

1:10:58.225 --> 1:10:59.960
What do you mean, Olivia?

1:11:00.827 --> 1:11:02.795
You got my letter!

1:11:05.065 --> 1:11:06.534
"Dear Santa Claus.

1:11:06.967 --> 1:11:08.768
This year as my present

1:11:08.902 --> 1:11:11.671
the only thing
I really want is to meet you.

1:11:12.705 --> 1:11:15.509
And for my brother to see you,

1:11:15.643 --> 1:11:18.279
and admit that you exist."

1:11:19.679 --> 1:11:22.416
And you, Liam?
What do you want for Christmas?

1:11:22.550 --> 1:11:23.816
I already got what I wanted.

1:11:23.951 --> 1:11:26.153
But I wouldn't mind
a Galactic Star Shuttle.

1:11:29.356 --> 1:11:30.823
- Here you are, young man!
- Oh!

1:11:30.958 --> 1:11:33.027
Ooh, there it is!

1:11:33.427 --> 1:11:35.695
Hang on. We'll open
presents together, okay?

1:11:36.263 --> 1:11:37.364
Sure.

1:11:38.532 --> 1:11:40.700
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:11:41.202 --> 1:11:42.236
And you.

1:11:42.702 --> 1:11:44.804
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh

1:11:44.939 --> 1:11:46.640
Oh, it's my lucky ski mask!

1:11:46.773 --> 1:11:48.242
And it's good as new!

1:11:48.375 --> 1:11:51.345
Frankie, baby, we're back
in business, yeah!

1:11:51.478 --> 1:11:52.712
Yeah!

1:11:52.845 --> 1:11:54.682
Uh, Santa, I think
we should get going.

1:11:54.814 --> 1:11:57.784
Otherwise, you know, we're going
to be late for the rounds. Yeah?

1:11:57.918 --> 1:11:59.353
Right.

1:12:04.692 --> 1:12:08.028
Listen, I was wondering
if after you're done

1:12:08.162 --> 1:12:09.930
delivering gifts
all over the world,

1:12:10.064 --> 1:12:11.565
maybe you and I could...

1:12:12.166 --> 1:12:13.667
I'll gladly accept.

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:15.936
-Alright.
-And you can call me
Elfia, Frankie-boy.

1:12:16.070 --> 1:12:18.305
Elfia and Frankie-boy.
I love it!

1:12:18.439 --> 1:12:19.373
Love it.

1:12:19.506 --> 1:12:20.908
