WHY?

08:11.021 --> 08:12.221

08:23.121 --> 08:24.954
‐ KIM JONG‐UN, LEMON.

08:24.987 --> 08:27.154
HAVE YOU SEEN NEWS FOOTAGE
OF THAT MAN?

08:27.187 --> 08:30.421
‐ I HAVE SO MANY MISSILE!

08:30.454 --> 08:33.154
I EVEN HAVE
NUCLEAR MISSILE.

08:33.187 --> 08:36.121
JUST FOR YOU,
SUGARPRONG.

08:36.154 --> 08:38.687
‐ THERE WAS ANOTHER
AMERICAN THERE, LEMON.

08:38.721 --> 08:41.121
A MAN. IT RAISES
SOME RED FLAGS.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.421
‐ OH, MY GOD.
WHO ARE YOU TO TALK?

08:42.454 --> 08:44.354
YOU FRENCH‐CANADIAN KISSED
HER MOTHER,

08:44.387 --> 08:45.987
WHICH IS MY NAME
FOR FRENCH KISSING

08:46.021 --> 08:47.321
WHEN IT BUMS
EVERYBODY ELSE OUT.

08:47.354 --> 08:51.487
‐ YES. BRILLIANT.
I'LL USE MY INDISCRETION

08:51.521 --> 08:53.154
TO GUILT HER INTO
REVEALING HERS.

08:53.187 --> 08:54.687
THE GAME IS AFOOT!

08:54.721 --> 08:57.021
‐ NO. SHE'S BEEN BACK
FOR, LIKE SIX HOURS.

08:57.054 --> 08:58.187
MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE TIME,

08:58.221 --> 09:00.221
LET THINGS GET BACK
TO NORMAL.

09:00.254 --> 09:02.721
‐ PLAYING PSYCHO‐SEXUAL
MIND GAMES IS OUR NORMAL, LEMON.

09:02.754 --> 09:06.321
THIS IS PERFECT.
EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

09:16.754 --> 09:19.721
‐ DADGUM POSSUM UP'N WHAT BIT
MY MAMA'S NECK BRACE.

09:19.721 --> 09:23.025
‐ DADGUM POSSUM UP AND WHAT

09:23.025 --> 09:25.392
‐ AGAIN!
‐ DADGUM POSSUM UP AND WHAT BEEN

09:25.425 --> 09:27.125
MY MOM'S NECK BRACE.

09:27.158 --> 09:29.025
‐ AGAIN, YOU WASTE
OF MY TIME!

09:29.058 --> 09:32.192
‐ DADGUM POSSUM UP'N WHAT BIT
MY MAMA'S NECK BRACE!

09:32.225 --> 09:34.558
‐ THERE IT IS.
AGAIN!

09:45.225 --> 09:47.525
EXCELLENT.
AGAIN!

09:47.558 --> 09:52.992
‐ DIXIE'S CALLIN', Y'ALL.
I RECKON YOU SHOULD ANSWER.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.592
NO, THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.458
THIS ISN'T SOUTHERN ELEGANCE.

09:57.492 --> 09:59.525
THIS IS A DIRTBAG GIRL
I ONCE KNEW.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.425
A GIRL NAMED JAY‐NUH!

10:01.458 --> 10:04.025
SHE USED TO GET INTO
FISTFIGHTS AT WATER PARKS,

10:04.058 --> 10:07.225
AND LOST HER VIRGINITY TO A BAIT
SALESMAN ON A WATER BED.

10:07.258 --> 10:11.025
SHE'S NOT WHO I AM ANYMORE.
I'M CLASSY.

10:11.058 --> 10:13.492
‐ PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT
ABOUT THEMSELVES USUALLY ARE.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.592
‐ THIS WHOLE SOUTHERN THING
IS WRONG.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.192
I NEED TO FIND
A NEW WEDDING SPONSOR

10:17.225 --> 10:18.525
THAT'S AS CLASSY
AS I AM.

10:18.558 --> 10:22.192
I'M NOT THIS PERSON,
'CAUSE I DONE GOT RID OF HER!

10:25.492 --> 10:27.092
‐ KIM JONG‐IL COULD NOT
BE REACHED FOR COMMENT

10:27.125 --> 10:28.525
BECAUSE HE WAS HAVING
A TOTALLY NORMAL DAY

10:28.558 --> 10:30.258
BEING ALIVE AND NOT DEAD.

10:30.292 --> 10:32.392
AND NOW WITH SPORTS,
SCOTT SCOTTSMAN.

10:32.425 --> 10:34.358
‐ THANKS, AVERY.
IN NBA ACTION,

10:34.392 --> 10:36.992
KIM JONG‐UN WON
THE CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY.

10:37.025 --> 10:38.592
OUR BRILLIANT COMRADE
SCORED 200 POINTS

10:38.625 --> 10:40.992
AND THEN WENT HOT‐TUBBING
WITH A COUPLE GUYS

10:41.025 --> 10:42.592
HE'S DEFINITELY
JUST FRIENDS WITH.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.558
[pause button hit]

10:46.625 --> 10:49.058
‐ HEY.
‐ HI.

10:49.092 --> 10:51.125
‐ LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER

10:51.158 --> 10:54.092
ABOUT FORGIVENESS‐‐
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.392
BUT I WOULD FEEL VERY GUILTY
IF I KEPT ANYTHING FROM YOU,

10:56.425 --> 10:58.492
AS I KNOW YOU WOULD IF YOU
KEPT SOMETHING FROM ME.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.058
SO WHILE YOU WERE AWAY,

11:01.092 --> 11:05.458
I DID HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

11:05.492 --> 11:08.058
‐ THANK YOU.

11:08.092 --> 11:09.392
I FORGIVE YOU.

11:09.425 --> 11:12.258
‐ YOU LOSE, JACK...

11:12.292 --> 11:14.258
IS WHAT KIM JONG‐IL SAID
TO JACK NICKLAUS

11:14.292 --> 11:15.392
AFTER DEFEATING HIM
IN GOLF TODAY

11:15.425 --> 11:18.292
BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH
TOTALLY ALIVE.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.425
‐ WOW, YOU WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT A FEDORA.

11:26.458 --> 11:29.025
‐ OH, THIS? I FINALLY WATCHED
THE PREMIERE

11:29.058 --> 11:31.525
OF PRIME SUSPECT ON HULU.
IT'S REALLY VERY GOOD.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.558
ANYWAY, I THOUGHT
I WOULD TREAT MYSELF.

11:33.592 --> 11:37.592
BUT DON'T WORRY, I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU TOO.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.325
‐ WOW. OKAY, BUT LOOK,

11:39.358 --> 11:41.292
I STILL WANT TO CHIP IN
ON THIS RENOVATION.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.192
‐ AND CLEAN OUT
YOUR LIFE SAVINGS?

11:43.225 --> 11:44.992
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THAT $200

11:45.025 --> 11:46.992
AND BUY YOURSELF
SOMETHING CUTE?

11:47.025 --> 11:50.325
HERE'S A HINT.
[whispers] I LIKE ZIPPERS.

11:50.358 --> 11:52.392
‐ I'M A MAN.
I'M A MAN, I'M A MAN!

11:52.425 --> 11:54.325
I'M AN ADULT MAN!

11:54.358 --> 11:55.992
YOU THINK I LIKE YOU HAVING
TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING?

11:56.025 --> 11:57.125
IT'S HUMILIATING.

11:57.158 --> 11:58.992
‐ BUT GENDER ROLES,
FAT DOLLS‐‐

11:59.025 --> 12:01.258
‐ YOU THINK I LIKE HAVING
TO EARN CRISSPOINTS

12:01.292 --> 12:04.158
SO THAT I CAN TAKE YOU ON DATES
THAT YOU ACTUALLY PAY FOR?

12:04.192 --> 12:05.558
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
THE CRISSPOINTS SYSTEM.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.025
‐ ONLY BECAUSE LIKING
THE CRISSPOINTS SYSTEM

12:08.058 --> 12:11.058
IS ONE OF THE WAYS
I EARN CRISSPOINTS!

12:11.092 --> 12:14.558
‐ OKAY, I'M SORRY THAT I
OFFENDED YOUR MALE PRIDE,

12:14.592 --> 12:17.425
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CHOSE
TO SELL HOT DOGS OUT OF A CAR.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.425
‐ IT IS A VAN
WITH A CAR ENGINE, LIZ, OKAY?

12:20.458 --> 12:23.525
NOW, LOOK, IF YOUR SHOW
GETS CANCELED, OKAY,

12:23.558 --> 12:26.025
OR NBC JUST BECOMES
A WEB SITE

12:26.058 --> 12:27.392
THAT SELLS
USED OFFICE SUPPLIES,

12:27.425 --> 12:29.292
I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT
I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU.

12:29.325 --> 12:32.025
AND NOW WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HAVING A PLANT?

12:32.058 --> 12:33.058
IT'S STRESSING ME OUT!

12:33.092 --> 12:35.025
‐ OH, REALLY?
IT'S STRESSING YOU OUT?

12:35.058 --> 12:36.025
OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE PERSON

12:36.058 --> 12:37.225
WHO HAS TO KRANG THAT PLANT
FOR NINE MONTHS,

12:37.258 --> 12:40.192
POOP IT, AND THEN GO BACK
TO WORK TO SUPPORT BOTH OF YOU!

12:40.225 --> 12:42.125
‐ UH‐HUH.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

12:42.158 --> 12:43.225
YOU NEED SOMEBODY DIFFERENT
TO DO THIS WITH.

12:43.258 --> 12:45.992
SOMEBODY WITH MONEY
THAT'S PROBABLY NAMED SPENCER

12:46.025 --> 12:47.292
OR GRANT.

12:47.325 --> 12:50.025
AND HE HAS A WATCH,
AND AN OFFICE WITH A TRASH CAN

12:50.058 --> 12:51.558
AND A LITTLE BASKETBALL HOOP
ON IT.

12:51.592 --> 12:53.458
AND HE PLAYS AS HARD
AS HE WORKS BECAUSE, DAMN IT,

12:53.492 --> 12:55.358
HE DESERVES TO BLOW OFF
A LITTLE STEAM.

12:55.392 --> 12:57.992
‐ GOD, I DON'T WANNA BE
WITH SPENCER!

12:58.025 --> 12:59.992
‐ AND YET YOU'RE SILENT
ABOUT GRANT.

13:00.025 --> 13:02.525
WELL, GUESS WHAT‐‐
I'M GONNA BECOME GRANT.

13:02.558 --> 13:05.125
THAT'S RIGHT, TOMORROW
I'M GONNA TAKE MY TRUCK OUT,

13:05.158 --> 13:08.592
AND I'M GONNA START
PULLING MY WEIGHT, LIKE A MAN.

13:08.625 --> 13:14.292
NOW, GET IN THAT BED,
AND LET'S WATCH DANCE MOMS.

13:22.025 --> 13:23.425
‐ HEY, GIRL.

13:23.458 --> 13:25.558
ARE YOU CRYING BECAUSE
THERE ARE NO ROLES

13:25.592 --> 13:28.992
FOR ACTRESSES IN THEIR 40s,
NOR SHOULD THERE BE?

13:29.025 --> 13:31.992
‐ I THOUGHT I FOUND A CLASSY
NEW SPONSOR FOR MY WEDDING,

13:32.025 --> 13:33.558
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED.

13:33.592 --> 13:35.125
‐ [from English accent
to Southern accent]

13:35.158 --> 13:37.125
HUBBARD'S FLAVORLESS
ENGLISH WATER BISCUITS‐‐

13:37.158 --> 13:38.525
[clears throat]
I'M SORRY.

13:38.558 --> 13:41.592
HUBBARD'S FLAVORLESS
ENGLISH WATER BISCUITS‐‐

13:41.625 --> 13:44.125
‐ CUT!
‐ THEY FIRED ME.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.392
WE DID 50 TAKES,
AND I COULDN'T DO IT.

13:46.425 --> 13:49.125
‐ 50? THAT'S NOTHING.
I ONCE DID 100 TAKES

13:49.158 --> 13:51.558
AND STILL COULDN'T SAY
THE WORD "INCORRIGIBLE."

13:51.592 --> 13:53.125
GREAT, NOW I GET IT!

13:53.158 --> 13:55.392
SIRI, BRING JESSICA TANDY
BACK TO LIFE.

13:55.425 --> 13:57.392
‐ I THOUGHT THAT GIRL
FROM TOILET SWAMP COVE

13:57.425 --> 13:58.592
WAS DEAD AND BURIED,

13:58.625 --> 14:00.992
BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE
INSIDE ME,

14:01.025 --> 14:02.558
AND NOW SHE'S TAKING OVER.

14:02.592 --> 14:05.092
I WANT TO THROW A NATTY LIGHT
AT A COP CAR!

14:05.125 --> 14:07.125
‐ I HAVE SOMEONE
INSIDE ME TOO.

14:07.158 --> 14:09.092
IT'S A BATH TOY
OF A SCUBA DIVER.

14:09.125 --> 14:12.158
‐ I NEED TO TAKE A WALK
AND CLEAR MY HEAD

14:12.192 --> 14:13.525
[cell phone chimes]
‐ TRACY...

14:13.558 --> 14:15.992
JESSICA TANDY'S ZOMBIE
IS COMING TO FIND YOU.

14:16.025 --> 14:17.392
IS THAT CORRECT?

14:17.425 --> 14:19.025
‐ YES, SIRI.
THANK YOU, BABY.

14:28.805 --> 14:29.802
‐ SO, LEMON,
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE

14:29.802 --> 14:31.737
AND USED MY TRANSGRESSION
WITH DIANA,

14:31.737 --> 14:33.517
AS A WEAPON
TO INTERROGATE AVERY,

14:33.517 --> 14:34.984
JUST AS YOU SUGGESTED.

14:35.017 --> 14:36.751
‐ THAT IS NOT
WHAT I SUGGESTED.

14:36.784 --> 14:37.984
YOU JUST HEAR
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

14:38.017 --> 14:39.784
‐ OH, THANK YOU.
THEY'RE FROM ITALY.

14:39.817 --> 14:41.484
I JUST GAVE AVERY
A LITTLE TASTE.

14:41.517 --> 14:43.517
SAID I WAS ATTRACTED
TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

14:43.551 --> 14:44.617
GUESS WHAT SHE TOLD ME.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.017
NOTHING.
SHE JUST FORGAVE ME.

14:47.051 --> 14:48.884
BELIEVE ME,
I DIDN'T EXPECT HER

14:48.917 --> 14:50.717
TO COME OUT OF HER
FORGIVENESS BUNKER SO EASILY,

14:50.751 --> 14:53.017
BUT I REALLY NEED
TO UP THE ANTE.

14:53.051 --> 14:54.717
DROP A GRENADE
IN THAT BUNKER,

14:54.751 --> 14:56.551
LIKE JIM BROWN
IN THE DIRTY DOZEN.

14:56.584 --> 14:57.951

YOUR WIFE?

15:01.851 --> 15:02.817
‐ GOD, SHE'S GOOD.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.651
THIS KIND OF GAMESMANSHIP
IS WHY I LOVE HER.

15:05.684 --> 15:08.951
SHE HAS THE BRAIN OF A MAN, AND
THE ASS OF A FRENCH TEENAGER.

15:08.984 --> 15:10.517
BUT I WILL WIN.

15:10.551 --> 15:12.017
‐ I DON'T KNOW, JACK,
IT'S 2012.

15:12.051 --> 15:14.084
IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR WHO WEARS
THE PANTS IN THE FAMILY.

15:14.117 --> 15:16.017
I DO, LEMON.
I WEAR THE PANTS.

15:16.051 --> 15:17.984
‐ GOOD MORNING.
‐ OH, GOOD MORNING.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.884
‐ NICE PANTS, AVERY.

15:21.651 --> 15:23.951
OH, YOU'RE HAIR'S THE SAME.

15:23.984 --> 15:26.484
‐ IT'S NOT. ACTUALLY,
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED.

15:26.517 --> 15:27.584
‐ I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

15:27.617 --> 15:28.651

I'M ELMARG!

17:12.051 --> 17:14.684
‐ [hick accent]
OH, THEM PUPPETS DONE PICKED

17:14.717 --> 17:16.984
THE WRONG DAY TO CROSS
MY KIN!

17:17.017 --> 17:20.784
IT'S ON,
PANHANDLE STYLE!

17:26.517 --> 17:27.951
WELL, IT'S OVER.

17:27.984 --> 17:30.584
I'M NEVER GONNA GET
A WEDDING SPONSOR NOW.

17:30.617 --> 17:34.084
THAT DIRTBAG JAY‐NUH WON.

17:34.117 --> 17:35.951
I WANTED MY WEDDING TO BE
AN EXPRESSION OF WHO I AM,

17:35.984 --> 17:36.951
AND NOW IT WILL BE.

17:36.984 --> 17:39.084
I'M A PANHANDLE HICK,

17:39.117 --> 17:41.017
AND MY WEDDING WILL BE
JUST ANOTHER PANEL

17:41.051 --> 17:43.717
ON MY MOTHER'S FAMILY HISTORY
BACK TATTOO.

17:43.751 --> 17:46.717
‐ OH, COME ON,
IT'S NOT ALL THAT BAD.

17:46.751 --> 17:48.551
LOOK AT THAT CAPTION.

17:48.584 --> 17:52.751
"AGING STAR, JENNA MARONEY,
BEATS UP ELMO WITH HER..."

17:52.784 --> 17:54.751
SO YOU OWN THINGS.
THAT'S GOOD.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.551
"CHRISTIAN..."
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD WORD.

17:57.584 --> 18:01.017
‐ WAIT, DID THEY SAY
"CHRISTIAN" ABOUT MY SHOES?

18:01.051 --> 18:03.484
"WITH HER
CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTINS."

18:03.517 --> 18:06.084
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY SHOES
WERE CHEAP KNOCKOFFS.

18:06.117 --> 18:07.684
THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FANCY,

18:07.717 --> 18:09.751
EVEN THOUGH
THEY'RE SECRETLY CRAP.

18:09.784 --> 18:13.017
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S WHO I AM!

18:13.051 --> 18:15.584
I'M THAT KNOCKOFF
DESIGNER SHOE.

18:15.617 --> 18:18.051
MY OUTSIDE IS
SHINY AND PRETTY,

18:18.084 --> 18:21.817
BUT MY INSIDE IS FILLED
WITH CARDBOARD AND HORSE GLUE.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.951
I'VE SOLVED
MY IDENTITY CRISIS!

18:23.984 --> 18:28.717
MORE IMPORTANTLY, I KNOW
WHO CAN SPONSOR MY WEDDING!

18:28.751 --> 18:32.551
[laughter, chatter]

18:32.584 --> 18:34.984
‐ NO, I THINK IT'S A VERY
COOL COSTUME, MAYOR BLOOMBERG.

18:35.017 --> 18:37.484
‐ TONIGHT,
I'M MAYOR BOOO‐MBERG.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.017
‐ YES, I THINK
YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.651
‐ BOOO...BOOO...

18:44.117 --> 18:45.617
‐ SCOTT.

18:45.651 --> 18:48.551
‐ HAPPY BIRTHDAVERSARY,
HONEY.

18:48.584 --> 18:50.584
‐ OH, JACK, THIS HOMECOMING'S
BEEN AMAZING.

18:50.617 --> 18:52.951
‐ NICE TO SEE YOU RELAXING
AND ENJOYING YOURSELF,

18:52.984 --> 18:56.017
AND TOTALLY UNPREPARED
FOR A FORGIVENESS ATTACK.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.984
‐ WHAT?
‐ AVERY...

18:58.017 --> 18:58.817
‐ WHAT?

18:58.851 --> 19:02.584
‐ THE WOMAN I KISSED
IS YOUR MOTHER.

19:02.617 --> 19:04.651
‐ [gasps]

19:04.684 --> 19:09.684
THAT IS...SHOCKING.

19:09.717 --> 19:12.884
BUT I TOLD YOU
ALL IS FORGIVEN,

19:12.917 --> 19:17.551
SO...ALL IS FORGIVEN.

19:17.584 --> 19:21.617
‐ WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY
TO GUILT THE TRUTH OUT OF YOU?

19:21.651 --> 19:22.784
HOW ABOUT THIS?
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

19:22.817 --> 19:23.917
LIDDY BROKE INTO
THE GUN SAFE

19:23.951 --> 19:26.017
AND SHOT UP
YOUR GIFT‐WRAPPING ROOM.

19:26.051 --> 19:27.817
I DID WEAR YOUR NIGHTGOWNS.

19:27.851 --> 19:29.984
NOT TO FEEL YOU NEAR,
THEY'RE JUST COMFORTABLE.

19:30.017 --> 19:34.884
I HAD AN EROTIC DREAM ABOUT
AN ADULT DORA THE EXPLORER.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.551
I TOOK HER ON A BALCONY
IN MADRID,

19:36.584 --> 19:38.651
ABOVE THE PLAZA MAYOR.

19:38.684 --> 19:41.084
SHE HAD FLOWERS
IN HER HAIR.

19:41.117 --> 19:42.684
NOW I'VE ADMITTED EVERYTHING.

19:42.717 --> 19:45.017
GAME OVER, AVERY.
TELL ME WHAT YOU DID.

19:45.051 --> 19:48.051
‐ I'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHAT I DID, JACK.

19:48.084 --> 19:50.717
I WON.
‐ YOU WHAT?

19:50.751 --> 19:52.017
‐ I GOT YOU TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU DID.

19:52.051 --> 19:55.084
AND GUESS WHAT‐‐
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

19:55.117 --> 19:57.484
‐ BUT SCOTT SCOTTSMAN‐‐
‐ UNTIL THE FLIGHT HOME,

19:57.517 --> 20:00.084
THE ONLY WORDS I'D EVER SAID
TO SCOTT SCOTTSMAN WERE,

20:00.117 --> 20:02.617
"AND NOW WITH SPORTS,
SCOTT SCOTTSMAN."

20:02.651 --> 20:03.917
‐ I THOUGHT I WAS PLAYING YOU,

20:03.951 --> 20:06.084
AND YOU WERE PLAYING ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.884
‐ AND IN 24 HOURS,
I GOT YOU TO TELL ME THINGS

20:07.917 --> 20:10.017
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU YEARS
TO ADMIT.

20:10.051 --> 20:12.484
NOW WE CAN START OVER.

20:12.517 --> 20:15.017
THE FINAL PIECE OF THE PUZZLE
IS JUST ME FORGIVING YOU

20:15.051 --> 20:19.884
FOR, UM...
KISSING MY MOTHER!

20:19.917 --> 20:22.017
‐ WE DID IT.
EVERYTHING'S NORMAL.

20:22.051 --> 20:24.484
‐ USA!
‐ IT'S CLASSIC US.

20:24.517 --> 20:26.584
DAMN IT, JESSUP,
I'D MARRY YOU ALL OVER AGAIN!

20:26.617 --> 20:30.584
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.
WE'VE GONNA RENEW OUR VOWS.

20:30.617 --> 20:32.517
‐ WE NEED A NEW BLENDER ANYWAY.
‐ OH, BABY.

20:32.551 --> 20:34.884
‐ OH!

20:34.917 --> 20:36.084
‐ SORRY I'M LATE.
CRISS GOT INTO A FIGHT

20:36.117 --> 20:37.684
WITH AN ELMO.

20:37.717 --> 20:39.617
AND HE HATES IT THAT
I MAKE MORE MONEY THAN HE DOES.

20:39.651 --> 20:40.917
AND I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED

20:40.951 --> 20:42.051
TO HAVE A PLANT TOGETHER.

20:42.084 --> 20:44.884
LOVE IS COMPLICATED, RIGHT?
‐ WRONG.

20:44.917 --> 20:47.084
WE KICKED LOVE'S ASS!
‐ YES!

20:47.117 --> 20:48.584
WE'RE RENEWING OUR VOWS.

20:48.617 --> 20:51.584
‐ NO, NO, RENEWING VOWS
IS A KISS OF DEATH.

20:51.617 --> 20:52.817
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME
FINISH MY RAP.
