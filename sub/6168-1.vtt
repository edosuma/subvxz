Bring up the couch.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.196
I'm a return!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.419
D'oh!

00:55.455 --> 00:57.222
<i>Turn left.</i>

00:57.257 --> 00:58.257
You're the driver.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.726
Watch it, ya jerk!

01:01.761 --> 01:03.428
<i>Turn left. Don't look at me.</i>

01:03.463 --> 01:04.629
<i>Look at the road.</i>

01:04.664 --> 01:05.897
Yes, dear.

01:08.335 --> 01:12.237
<i>In 50 feet ago,</i>
<i>U-turn without signaling.</i>

01:12.272 --> 01:13.438
Oh...

01:17.844 --> 01:19.578
<i>Turn left, into Garbage Alley.</i>

01:25.452 --> 01:27.119
Mmm.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.224
Uh, uh...

01:32.259 --> 01:34.659
Huh? What? Huh?

01:34.694 --> 01:36.428
What the hell do those mean?

01:37.797 --> 01:39.164
<i>Can't stop,</i>
<i>I have to hit one of them.</i>

01:39.199 --> 01:40.599
<i>Man or dog?</i>

01:40.634 --> 01:42.100
<i>Oh, it's a Snoopy's Choice.</i>

01:42.135 --> 01:43.935
<i>I guess your days</i>

01:43.970 --> 01:45.670
<i>of eating out of the garbage</i>
<i>are over, Gil.</i>

01:45.705 --> 01:47.105
Hey...

01:48.475 --> 01:50.942
<i>I was never here.</i>

01:50.977 --> 01:53.145
<i>I saw nothing.</i>

01:54.648 --> 01:56.948
Now I do have to warn
you, if Gil sues,

01:56.983 --> 01:58.984
he'll end up with
everything you've got.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.619
But that's everything I got.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.955
Okay, kids, give me
your best worried looks.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.524
Ooh, that's good worry.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.292
And Maggie, when we visit Gil,

02:07.327 --> 02:10.162
you should think about your mom
and me disappearing forever

02:10.197 --> 02:12.498
any time we step behind a wall.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.700
Where am I?

02:15.735 --> 02:17.002
Where am I?

02:18.572 --> 02:21.506
No, seriously, where did I go?

02:21.541 --> 02:22.707
It's so dark in here.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.176
Maggie!

02:28.748 --> 02:30.182
Ol' Gil,

02:30.217 --> 02:32.817
there must be something
we can do for you.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.819
Hmm? Hmm?

02:34.854 --> 02:37.322
Ah, there sure is, you can
let me scratch your husband.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.657
Sure, but why?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.158
Because you're
the lottery ticket

02:40.193 --> 02:41.993
I've been waiting
for all my life!

02:42.028 --> 02:43.328
Bam!

02:43.363 --> 02:45.330
Zing!
Before this goes
any further,

02:45.365 --> 02:48.500
can you just take one look
at our darling daughters?

02:48.535 --> 02:51.736
Mr. Gunderson? They don't let
saxophones in the I.C.U.,

02:51.771 --> 02:54.172
so I'll just tell you
the song I wrote for you.

02:54.207 --> 02:55.540
B-flat, C, D-flat...

02:55.575 --> 02:57.409
If memory serves,
you have a son.
...B-flat, C...

02:57.444 --> 02:59.678
Where's he at?

02:59.713 --> 03:03.081
I'm here
to give Mr. Gunderson his shot.

03:03.116 --> 03:05.183
Boy, the "putting
him in a coma" idea

03:05.218 --> 03:07.018
was just dinner
table chatter.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.587
I did not sign off.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.188
You tapped your nose.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.690
I was scratching it.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.026
Well, I got to put
something in a coma.

03:15.061 --> 03:17.762
Why, you little...

03:19.799 --> 03:22.067
Well, I'll see you in court.
Zing!

03:22.102 --> 03:23.201
Ah, cha-cha-cha!

03:23.236 --> 03:24.703
Cha-cha-cha?

03:24.738 --> 03:25.870
That's hopeful.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.539
Cha-cha-ching!

03:27.574 --> 03:29.241
Oh.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.779
Your Honor, my client
had just turned his life around.

03:34.814 --> 03:37.082
His daughter recently bought
a washing machine

03:37.117 --> 03:39.117
and promised him the box
to live in.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.086
Do you think they'll send
Dad away forever?

03:41.121 --> 03:42.587
Oh, no, sweetie.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.723
They just want
all our money.

03:44.758 --> 03:48.160
Will they send us
to live with other families?

03:52.799 --> 03:55.066
Miss Simpson, from now on
you shall live with us,

03:55.101 --> 03:57.902
receiving musical instruction
from Mr. Adolphe Sax himself.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.606
Adolphe. A name that
will only be associated

04:01.641 --> 04:04.075
with beautiful music.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.245
<i> We'll be free</i>
<i>to do whatever we want.</i>

04:07.280 --> 04:09.080
A thousand bucks a kidney?

04:09.115 --> 04:10.148
Take them both.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.249
Hmm.

04:11.284 --> 04:13.318
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

04:16.589 --> 04:17.789
Mr. Simpson,

04:17.824 --> 04:19.624
you deliberately ran your car

04:19.659 --> 04:22.494
into my paycheck...
I-I mean, my client.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.462
No, "paycheck" is better.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.931
What possible defense
could you have?

04:26.966 --> 04:28.266
I had no other choice.

04:28.301 --> 04:29.467
I didn't want to hit a dog.

04:29.502 --> 04:30.468
Aw...

04:30.503 --> 04:32.003
A dog?
He saved a dog?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.605
He was gonna
save a dog.
Wow.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.939
People love dogs.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.008
This is our key
to winning this case.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.143
You're on my side, right?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.277
I am.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.481
Now, go ahead, son.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.850
You tell us how
you got your dog.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.452
It was Christmas, sir.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.288
We saved him
and he saved us.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.956
Now we love the dog,

04:51.991 --> 04:54.659
and the dog gives us
all the love we could handle.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.027
Love.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.295
Aw...

04:57.330 --> 04:58.997
Could the stenographer
read that last part back

04:59.032 --> 05:00.965
with sentimental music?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.335
"The dog gives us all the love

05:03.370 --> 05:06.338
we could handle. Love."

05:07.674 --> 05:09.674
Does the defendant
ask this court

05:09.709 --> 05:12.210
to believe that in order
to avoid hitting a dog,

05:12.245 --> 05:14.546
it is acceptable
to hit a human--

05:14.581 --> 05:16.147
my client?

05:16.182 --> 05:18.383
It's looking good, Homie.
According to our consultant,

05:18.418 --> 05:21.053
the toughest nut to crack
is juror number six.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.055
Aw, good doggy.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.991
Ladies and gentlemen,
this man is a human being,

05:27.026 --> 05:29.327
just like you or me.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.529
Surely his life has more value

05:31.564 --> 05:36.000
than some creature that scoots
its buttocks along the ground.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.335
Aw...

05:37.370 --> 05:38.803
Or-or gets
its head stuck

05:38.838 --> 05:40.839
in an empty
pickle jar.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.340
Aw!

05:42.375 --> 05:44.576
Or walks on
a hot sidewalk

05:44.611 --> 05:47.545
in a way that suggests
it's dancing!

05:47.580 --> 05:49.848
Aw!

05:49.883 --> 05:52.083
This is ridiculous.
I'm a human being here,

05:52.118 --> 05:54.018
not some dumb animal.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.353
What?
I never.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.188
Who are you
calling dumb?

05:57.223 --> 05:59.858
The dogs who sniff for bombs
at the airport?

05:59.893 --> 06:04.596
The St. Bernards who save lives
on the slopes of St. Moritz?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.197
Or this one?

06:13.606 --> 06:15.673
Now, I have a brief instruction
for the jury:

06:15.708 --> 06:18.209
"There's more sanctity
in a dog's loyalty

06:18.244 --> 06:20.412
than there is
in all your human laws."

06:25.084 --> 06:26.551
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, how...

06:26.586 --> 06:28.386
Not guilty.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.754
Case dismissed.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.924
We won! It's all
because of you, boy.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.426
Mwah.
Aw...

06:34.461 --> 06:36.394
Aw, I have never
been more glad

06:36.429 --> 06:38.229
that I didn't hit
you with my car,

06:38.264 --> 06:40.064
secretly bury you,
get another greyhound,

06:40.099 --> 06:43.134
paint it your exact coloring,
then realize it's a girl,

06:43.169 --> 06:45.737
stick on a fake wang, and
pretend that she's you

06:45.772 --> 06:48.106
for however long
dogs live.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.341
Aw...

06:51.611 --> 06:53.745
Take us to the dog park!

06:55.448 --> 06:57.415
I know I've been through a lot,

06:57.450 --> 06:59.984
but I always believed people
cared about a human being

07:00.019 --> 07:01.820
more than a dog.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.088
Hold it,
I forgot my phone charger.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.662
Oh, wait,
this isn't mine.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.270
It's now official:
a Springfield jury has decided

07:19.305 --> 07:22.474
that the life of this greyhound
is more valuable

07:22.509 --> 07:25.176
than the life of this
Greyhound station inhabitant.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.780
Look at me, I'm a big man.
A big man!

07:28.815 --> 07:30.148
Anybody got a quarter?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.450
Got to be a quarter,
not two dimes and a nickel.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.985
That ain't worth jack.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.187
What's your take on all
this, Anger Watkins?

07:36.222 --> 07:39.491
I'm angrier than a beehive
in a paint mixer.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.459
This is the craziest
legal decision

07:41.494 --> 07:43.361
ever made outside
of Arizona.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.463
What's next?
Cats get credit cards?

07:45.498 --> 07:47.699
Let a snail race
in the Indy 500?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.801
Like that stupid movie <i> Turbo?</i>

07:49.836 --> 07:52.470
I tried to inhale
nitrous oxide to get fast.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.540
I ended up naked
behind an appliance store!

07:55.575 --> 07:56.641
Lies!

07:56.676 --> 07:58.543
Lies! Lies!

07:58.578 --> 08:01.713
Oh, you're gonna get
ten walks a day, boy.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.848
You can
even bite the mailman.

08:06.352 --> 08:07.685
There he is.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.021
America's number one
doggy daddy.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.489
Would you care to
do the honors?

08:11.524 --> 08:12.657
Would I!

08:12.692 --> 08:14.826
Uh, that's what I asked.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.628
Would you?

08:18.197 --> 08:20.999
You're the greatest man
I know one thing about!

08:27.707 --> 08:29.040
Look at all those voters.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.075
What is our current position
on dogs?

08:31.110 --> 08:32.744
We currently have
a city employee

08:32.779 --> 08:35.013
who rounds them up
and puts them to sleep.

08:35.048 --> 08:37.015
What? I can't believe
such a jerk

08:37.049 --> 08:39.017
would even be
elected dog catcher.

08:39.052 --> 08:41.519
From this point forth,
this town will be known

08:41.554 --> 08:44.255
as the dog-loving capital
of the world.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.757
That'll put Springfield
on the map.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.592
Yeah, why aren't we
on the map?

08:47.627 --> 08:50.862
I don't know. I made, like,
20 calls to Rand McNally.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.864
They don't even know
what state we're in.

08:52.899 --> 08:56.100
Thanks to these hastily-passed
untested pandering laws,

08:56.135 --> 09:00.204
Springfield is now the most
dog-friendly city in America.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.441
Er, uh, arf.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.480
Is there anything here
the dogs haven't gotten into?

09:42.515 --> 09:44.148
Just the dog food.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.250
Why are you shutting me down?

09:46.285 --> 09:48.486
You made a dog wait
for a teeth cleaning

09:48.521 --> 09:51.255
while you saved a
racehorse's life?

09:51.290 --> 09:54.459
And you call yourself
a veterinarian. Ha.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.927
And you know what
we found inside?

09:55.962 --> 09:57.595
Dogs in cages.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.497
That's no way to treat
man's best friend.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.632
Lock him up.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.766
In a cage.

10:01.801 --> 10:02.967
Like a dog.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.268
Don't you understand?

10:04.303 --> 10:06.671
Dogs are born
to follow and obey.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.439
The moment the pack realizes

10:08.474 --> 10:11.109
that humans are no longer
their masters,

10:11.144 --> 10:15.013
thousands of years
of domestication will fall away.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.116
They'll revert
to their wild wolf nature.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.517
Well, then I guess
you'll be happy

10:19.552 --> 10:21.953
being nice and
safe in jail.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.622
Oh, yes, please!
Take me there now.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.124
You're all doomed!

10:26.159 --> 10:28.326
Doomed.

10:29.662 --> 10:31.629
Santa's Little Helper
didn't come home last night.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.165
If you were a dog these
days, would you come home?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.968
It's like doggy heaven
out there, only real.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.469
Doggy heaven isn't real?

10:38.504 --> 10:39.671
No! No, it's real!

10:39.706 --> 10:41.806
The dogs all have
harps and wings.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.875
How do they play harps
if they don't have fingers?

10:43.910 --> 10:46.044
Um... dogs have fingers
in heaven.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.945
How do you know so much
about dog heaven?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.381
I died for five minutes and
was sent there by mistake.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.649
Now leave me alone.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.488
Hmm...

10:57.523 --> 10:58.990
Ooh! Come on, girl.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.325
Ow! Ow, ow. Just get
him by the collar.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.528
You can do it. Come
on, don't bite me.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.496
Come on. Pull.
Come on.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.699
Dad, we don't have
time for this.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.534
Quiet. I'm doing
something important.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.869
There you go.
Yes, that's it!

11:11.904 --> 11:13.871
Well, well, well,

11:13.906 --> 11:16.841
look what the cat dragged in.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.843
Worth it.
Totally worth it.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.178
I know.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.253
Kirk, Taquito is
digging up my dahlias.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.689
Stop him.
Mm.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.092
Sorry.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.359
Please don't hurt me.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.728
I'm exposing my belly.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.530
See? Exposing. Exposing!

11:57.817 --> 12:00.618
See ya later, Moe!

12:02.755 --> 12:05.456
Huh? My car's not starting.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.725
Oh, I see the problem.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.560
Out of gas.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.763
Well, probably safer
to walk anyway.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.234
Yep, nothing safer than walking.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.902
This is so healthy.

12:17.937 --> 12:20.238
Thanks to this walk,
I'll live a lot longer.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.415
Hey, here come some
of my four-footed friends.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.651
I guess you want to meet the guy
who's responsible

12:33.686 --> 12:35.586
for making
all your lives better.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.157
Okay, wait a minute.
Let me guess.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.325
Collie, dachshund,
Tibetan Mastiff,

12:41.360 --> 12:43.261
otterhound, Swedish Vallhund,

12:43.296 --> 12:45.496
Finnish Spitz,
Norwegian Lundehund,

12:45.531 --> 12:48.766
Catahoula Leopard Dog,
Lagotto Romagnolo,

12:48.801 --> 12:50.334
and three wolves!

12:52.371 --> 12:54.539
Stand back! Back!

12:55.975 --> 12:56.941
Ow!

12:56.976 --> 12:58.342
Oh!

12:58.377 --> 12:59.677
You don't scare me.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.579
Your bark is worse
than your bite.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.082
Oh, those horrible barks!

13:10.356 --> 13:12.623
<i>Dr. Budgie warned them.</i>

13:12.658 --> 13:14.192
Dr. Budgie warned all of them.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.194
But did they listen
to Dr. Budgie?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.629
All right, that's it.
I'm comin' in there!

13:18.664 --> 13:20.464
Oh, for cryin'
out...

13:20.499 --> 13:22.466
Maybe if I
turn sideways.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.869
Lou, get
the bar butter!

13:24.904 --> 13:28.973
This is what happens when
you buy European prison cells.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.345
Kids, lower the Purge armor!

13:34.380 --> 13:36.180
We don't have
any Purge armor.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.850
Oh, right. I always mean to buy
it the day after the Purge,

13:38.885 --> 13:40.685
when it's cheaper.
What happened?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.186
The dogs have gone savage!

13:42.221 --> 13:43.821
They've taken over the town!

13:44.857 --> 13:45.823
No, boy.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.658
Resist the call of the wild.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.894
Like I did when they assigned
that book for summer reading.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.063
Somebody help! Stop him!

13:56.068 --> 13:57.201
D'oh!

13:57.236 --> 14:00.004
Oh, we've lost him to the pack.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.706
No, he's a good dog.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.507
He'd never turn against us.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.377
Hmm, he's ripping the stuffing
out of your car seats.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.678
Oh, yeah?!

14:07.713 --> 14:08.880
You think you're so smart?!

14:08.915 --> 14:12.016
Okay! I'm eating your dog food!

14:12.051 --> 14:13.718
This is on you!

14:13.753 --> 14:15.853
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.764
Hmm. Not one student
showed up to school

14:26.799 --> 14:29.767
just because a pack
of ferocious, masterless dogs

14:29.802 --> 14:31.535
are roaming the playground.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.371
Ow! Damn it!

14:33.406 --> 14:36.374
I thought we sent Willie
out there to deal with them.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.710
I did. But he, uh,
hasn't returned.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.713
I've finally been accepted
for who I truly am.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.724
How come I don't get
a dog-proof suit?

14:53.759 --> 14:55.726
Because I smell
like lamb, Lou.

14:55.761 --> 14:58.396
Very well. You were
right and we were wrong.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.899
Yes. Um, can you remove
the shackles?

15:01.934 --> 15:03.401
Don't push your luck.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.103
These dogs, they walk around
all high and mighty,

15:06.138 --> 15:08.439
no regard for anyone else
on the planet.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.274
I mean, that's humans' job!

15:10.309 --> 15:13.110
Repeal the stupid new laws!

15:13.145 --> 15:15.079
Yes. Repeal the dog--

15:15.114 --> 15:17.448
and child labor-- laws!

15:17.483 --> 15:20.084
Fine, just the dog ones.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.652
I say "status," you say...

15:21.687 --> 15:22.653
Quo!

15:22.688 --> 15:24.088
So passed!

15:24.123 --> 15:27.325
Well, everything's back
to normal again.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.894
It's a pity no one told
the dogs that.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.762
Huh?
Wha?!

15:31.797 --> 15:34.598
You fools have surrendered
your position as alpha dogs.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.968
Until you reassert
human dominance,

15:37.003 --> 15:41.138
it is you who will be calling
these savage canines master.

15:41.173 --> 15:45.109
Who among you is brave enough
to tame this slobbering horde?

15:48.347 --> 15:51.115
Well, I guess
it's up to ol' Gil.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.850
Gil? Why are you helping
these people

15:52.885 --> 15:54.452
who think
so little of you?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.120
That's why
I'm doin' it!

15:56.155 --> 15:59.023
To show everyone I'm
not the town failure.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.459
I thought <i> I</i> was
the town failure!

16:01.494 --> 16:03.361
You're not even that.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.595
Aw!

16:04.630 --> 16:06.130
So who will come with me?!

16:06.165 --> 16:07.798
None of us!

16:07.833 --> 16:09.133
One more time!

16:09.168 --> 16:10.334
Nobody!

16:10.369 --> 16:12.169
I can't hear you!

16:12.204 --> 16:13.705
Yes, you can!

16:14.740 --> 16:16.374
Standing next to me

16:16.409 --> 16:18.376
is the man whose life
we all agreed

16:18.411 --> 16:20.378
was worth less than a dog.

16:20.413 --> 16:24.548
I say we stand behind him
as he redeems himself!

16:24.583 --> 16:26.217
Even though he did
nothing wrong.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.686
Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,

16:28.721 --> 16:31.322
Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil, Gil,

16:31.357 --> 16:33.725
Gil, Gil!

16:36.362 --> 16:38.195
We've got to get
Santa's Little Helper back.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.831
It's too dangerous!

16:40.866 --> 16:42.500
You kids
ain't goin' nowhere!

16:42.535 --> 16:43.768
I got this.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.573
Fine. But we
can't go out alone.

16:49.608 --> 16:53.077
We need someone who knows
how to fend off angry dogs.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.081
Here, boy! Come on, boy!

16:57.116 --> 16:59.183
Oh, where can he be?

17:15.601 --> 17:18.234
Grampa, I called to make sure
the kids are okay.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.738
They're not okay!
The boy's got sass,

17:20.772 --> 17:23.074
and the girl thinks
she's Queen of the May.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.742
You leave 'em with me
and I'll straighten 'em out!

17:25.778 --> 17:27.411
I <i> did</i> leave them with you.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.380
Why the hell would you do that?!

17:29.415 --> 17:31.749
Here, boy.
Here, boy. Here, boy.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.624
It's the alpha.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.261
I know that dog.

17:44.296 --> 17:45.896
It's the one Milhouse got

17:45.931 --> 17:48.433
when he didn't wet
the bed for a week.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.075
We're about to die
at the hands of a dog!

17:58.110 --> 17:59.777
Paws. Dogs have paws.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.113
Just remember the last thing
you did in life was correct me.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.248
Oh, that actually
makes me feel better.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.924
This has gone on long enough!

18:15.661 --> 18:16.627
You sit!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.702
I'm sorry!

18:25.971 --> 18:28.939
Mom, you've become
the alpha dog!

18:28.974 --> 18:31.775
Dogs are nice.
I love dogs.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.011
Because, in dogs,
we see the things we wish

18:34.046 --> 18:36.280
we saw more of in people:

18:36.315 --> 18:39.483
lifelong friendship,
unwavering loyalty,

18:39.518 --> 18:42.786
and a willingness
to eat anything you cook.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.121
You rang?

18:44.156 --> 18:46.323
Ol' Gil's here
to save the day!

18:46.358 --> 18:48.325
Where are those out
of control pooches?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.828
Sorry, ol' Gil,
you're too late.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.297
But-but I was supposed
to redeem myself

18:53.332 --> 18:55.332
and finally earn
the town's respect.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.134
Uh, good job, Gil.

18:57.169 --> 19:00.838
You had to stop at the Automat
for an egg salad sandwich.

19:00.873 --> 19:03.040
Well, at least
you still have the sandwich.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.909
Uh... Aw...

19:06.245 --> 19:08.045
Baz, you belong
with the Flanders.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.146
Okily-dokily.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.881
Dalmatian, fire department.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.685
Mr. Burns, the hounds.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.187
Excellent.

19:16.222 --> 19:17.655
Uh, since you were gone,

19:17.690 --> 19:19.323
all I had to release were
the June bugs.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.028
Willie, Skinner.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.063
Aw, good boy.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.046
You'll have your day.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.421
It's gonna be hard to cheer
myself up after this day.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.190
Hey, little fella!

19:53.225 --> 19:54.892
You had a bad night, too, huh?

19:54.927 --> 19:58.028
Come on out. I won't hurt ya.

19:58.063 --> 20:02.233
You just licked away
a very bad day.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.636
Attaboy!

20:52.084 --> 20:54.085
Shh!
