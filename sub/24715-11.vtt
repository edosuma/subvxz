ANDY: <i>Previously on</i> NYPD Blue...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.504
I’ve sent Michael back to social services.

00:04.629 --> 00:06.089
-Why?
-Michael’s father showed up.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.675
If he’s made any threats,
we can do something about it.

00:08.758 --> 00:09.884
My wife doesn’t feel safe.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.554
-I’ll talk to Michael’s father.
-We’re done.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.389
I’m off the list for captain’s money.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.266
-You’re kidding.
-A little payback for the trial.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.393
This is as far as I’ll go on the job.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.937
-Give them a year.
-I’ve already given them 18.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.982
-Why you messing up Michael’s life?
-Can I ask you the same thing?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.900
We’re helping him out. Get him a place
to live. That’s messing with him?

00:26.067 --> 00:28.987
I’m talking about you trying to turn him
into a white boy like yourself.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.781
Go ahead, white boy.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.534
-You glad about going to your aunt’s?
-I don’t even really know her.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.786
Well, I talked to her on the phone.
She seems like a nice person.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.539
-Tammy? Hi, I’m Detective Jones.
-Hi.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.876
I can’t have any problems with his dad.
That’s my only condition.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.128
Michael’s father tries
to contact you for any reason,

00:45.211 --> 00:46.254
-call me.
-All right.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.382
Hey.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.552
-Hey, Aunt Tammy.
-Look at you, all grown up.

00:53.845 --> 00:54.971
Ready?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.182
-Yeah.
-TAMMY: Come on.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.781
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-Morning.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.658
Hey. DOA’s a Stuart Steinman.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.620
That’s his jewelry store,
and that’s his wife.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.164
-ANDY: She with him?
-No, they live across the street.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.875
She heard the shots, looked out
the window, saw her husband.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.462
-The wallet’s on him, and 300 cash.
-Was he carrying jewelry?

01:27.712 --> 01:29.756
-The wife said he wasn’t.
-She see anyone leaving the scene?

01:30.131 --> 01:32.258
She broke down.
We were giving her a minute.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.886
-She looks better now.
-We'll start a canvass.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.096
ANDY: All right.

01:36.846 --> 01:40.433
(CLEARS THROAT) Mrs. Steinman,
uh, detectives Sipowicz and Clark.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.060
We’re very sorry.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.396
-Did you hear the shots this morning?
-(SOBS) I was in the bedroom.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.108
I looked out the window
and saw him lying there.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.027
-JOHN: Did you see anyone on the street?
-I just saw Stuart.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.239
-What about a car pulling away?
-I was looking at my husband.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.990
Can you think of anyone
who might have done this?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.659
Oh, he was a decent man.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.246
Anyone who was giving him trouble,
personally or in his business life?

02:01.329 --> 02:03.498
-(SNIFFLES) Maybe.
-Who, Mrs. Steinman?

02:03.998 --> 02:06.543
-Well, there’s this neighborhood guy.
-(POLICE SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

02:07.001 --> 02:09.003
Last week, he told Stuart

02:09.170 --> 02:11.756
he should rot in hell,
and would rot in hell.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.342
-On account of what?
-Being a Jew.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.971
This guy calls himself
Muhammad something. But he’s white.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.181
A convert.
Now, what could be more foolish?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.600
Did your husband and this guy
ever get into fights physically?

02:23.017 --> 02:25.728
Just a lot of yelling back
and forth from both of them.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.314
-Did you hear that this morning?
-No.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.191
You know where this Muhammad lives?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.735
It’s got to be nearby.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.823
I think he goes to the mosque on 8th.
(SNIFFLES)

02:37.157 --> 02:40.743
Stuart just thought
he was a dumb, confused kid.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.996
Okay. Well, we’ll look into it,
Mrs. Steinman.

02:43.371 --> 02:47.792
They need to get the blood off the street.
He needs to be buried whole.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.544
I don’t know how to do that.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.588
All right. Why don’t you give us
the number of your rabbi?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.840

We got a DOA Jewish male.

04:15.505 --> 04:18.591
Main suspect right now is a Muslim
the DOA had some run-ins with.

-Junior’s trying to get an address on him.
-IRWIN: Fifteenth Squad.

-formerly known as Tim Garrity.
-Detective Jones? It’s Michael.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.309
DOA was a jeweler,
but there’s no indication

04:28.476 --> 04:30.645
this was a robbery gone bad,
which makes us think

04:30.728 --> 04:33.189
-this was a straight beef.
-GREG: Bias unit’s been notified

On her way to Bellevue.
She got knocked around pretty good.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.433

05:08.516 --> 05:10.310

Aunt Tammy just got attacked.

-So, I run back here, called you.
-Where’s Tammy’s other kids?

Nope.

Has he been here at all
since you moved in?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.641
No. I told you I’d let you know if he did.

’Cause it sounds
like something he’d do, Michael.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.355
I didn’t see him.
I don’t know what else to tell you.

05:55.438 --> 05:59.317
If you’re lying, if you know your dad
was here, I’m done, Michael.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.153

He got assaulted this morning.
We know that you two liked to get into it.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.430
Just verbally. Discussion.

-Regarding?
-Zionism, Palestine, Islam.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.854

-He’s dead. Shot twice.

Account for yourself this morning.

-Is that an accusation?
-Yeah, it is, Tim.

06:55.873 --> 06:57.834
Because I engaged the man
in verbal discourse,

06:57.917 --> 07:02.171
-or because I’m a Muslim?
-It’s just you in here, no other Muslims.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.882
I ask you not to disparage
the name of my religion.

07:05.049 --> 07:09.137

-Two years ago.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.780
-Why did you convert?
-Why are you a cop?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.409
To solve crimes like this one.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.538
But unlike you and your conversion,
I’ve been at this for over 30 years.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.373

08:39.727 --> 08:41.395
Draw you into beating the hell
out of him,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.481

08:43.564 --> 08:45.233
Yeah. Which is why I haven’t.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.402
Well, if he’s trying to get to you,

look, and she made it pretty clear

09:01.624 --> 09:05.336
that she’s not getting involved
past the general description she gave us.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.297

So, Phoebe, um, how long
have you worked for Mr. Steinman?

09:33.155 --> 09:34.156
Two years.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.285
Do you know anything about his arguments
with a Muslim guy in the neighborhood?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.287
The white kid? Sure.

09:39.370 --> 09:41.497
Did he ever say he felt threatened
by this white kid?

09:41.664 --> 09:45.751
Mr. Steinman felt sorry for him,
'cause he was so misguided.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.338
Anybody else your boss
was having problems with?

09:49.797 --> 09:52.800
No. I mean, I don’t know.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.096
Phoebe... if you know something,
you need to tell me.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.348
Could it fall under the heading of,

09:59.432 --> 10:02.226
"You didn’t hear it from me,"
for various reasons?

10:02.351 --> 10:03.352
Sure.

10:04.562 --> 10:08.357
I overheard Mr. Steinman
having an argument with DJ Drayno.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.611
The rapper, you know?

10:13.195 --> 10:18.451
Darnell Ellison, real tough guy.
He’s been shot a few times.

10:18.576 --> 10:22.163
-He was a client to Mr. Steinman’s?
-And some other pretty well-known rappers.

10:22.538 --> 10:28.336
They commissioned big, flashy pieces,
30 to 50,000 in stones.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.172
-What was the argument about?
-I don’t know,

10:31.255 --> 10:32.548
because it was over the phone,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.592
-but it was ugly.
-Like threatening?

10:34.759 --> 10:35.801
Like nasty.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.055
And, personally, I wouldn’t want
to get on Drayno’s bad side.

10:39.430 --> 10:44.518
I think people who have end up dead.
At least that’s what he sings about.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.980
Well, do you have an address
for this, um, Drayno?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.025
I don’t have addresses
for any of these guys.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.612
-And they only pay in cash.
-Well, how can we find him?

10:54.737 --> 11:00.076
He hangs out at Phat Factory on Bleecker.
It’s a hip-hop record store.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.287
He had invited me there once
to hang out with him.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.750
I mean, I didn’t go. (CHUCKLES)
What would my mom say? (CHUCKLES)

11:07.833 --> 11:11.045
Phat Factory, okay. Well, thanks, Phoebe.
We’ll be in touch.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.637
Boss, the, uh... the DOA Steinman
had a rapper clientele.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.807
His salesgirl just gave us one
to look at, DJ Drayno.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.017
-Where are Sipowicz and Clark?
-Recanvassing.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.688

-Looking for work.
-As a beer taster?

11:42.827 --> 11:44.787
I’ve been out pounding
the pavement for days now

11:44.954 --> 11:48.874
per my parole requirements.
I got a lot of doors slammed in my face.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.169
Frustration got to me,
and I had myself a drink or two.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.254
That’s all.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.967
That frustration get you over

this morning?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.680
No, ma’am. I’ve been instructed
to keep away from there,

12:02.763 --> 12:04.682
and that’s just what I’ve been doing.

knocking on Tammy’s door.

I dealt with you people before.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.982
I’ve been lied to before,

i.e., you’re trying to call
what you think is my bluff

12:16.902 --> 12:18.904
by presenting facts I know ain’t true.

-Well, I ain’t biting.
-No bluffing this time, Craig.

We got a witness.
We’ll prove you were there.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.622
Okay, so, say you prove I was there.
Let’s assume that.

12:29.373 --> 12:33.169
Don’t mean I beat up on Tammy.
Hell, she’s taking care of my son.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.588
If anything, I reach my hand
out to her in gratitude.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.841
You’ve been up all night drinking.
You went over there looking for Michael.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.885
Tammy gave you some lip,
and you smacked her around.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.803

Your ex-wife couldn’t testify
about the beating you gave her,

12:48.225 --> 12:50.269
but the difference here is Tammy lived.

after they reconstruct her eye socket,

12:54.857 --> 12:56.066

-Mostly we talk on the phone.
-What was your last conversation about?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.790
-Why?
-Steinman got shot this morning.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.500
-Wasn’t me.
-Always got that "wasn’t me"

14:36.584 --> 14:40.462
-right at the tip of your tongue?
-Lots of folks get shot in my game, son.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.464
And I know when I’m the one
who did it. This wasn’t me.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.508
Afraid we’re gonna need you
to convince us of that.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.136
'Cause the way we hear it,
your last conversation with Steinman

14:47.344 --> 14:49.263
was more of an argument. What about?

who I was banging around on,
but I’m past that.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.026
And to prove it, I laid on her
an emerald and diamond necklace

15:02.151 --> 15:04.570
of Kermit the Frog.
Or I thought it was emeralds and diamonds,

15:04.820 --> 15:07.573
‘cause she had it appraised,
and it wasn’t worth dick.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.867
-What did you pay for that?
-Sixty grand.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.746
Wasn’t worth five. Paper's was all off,
wasn’t nothing about it for real.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456

or we got serious trouble."

-He didn’t know what I was talking about.

that he’ll turn things around

but that’s just not gonna happen, Michael.

went to the trouble

so, he could rip your husband off?

24:42.230 --> 24:44.816
you know about their dealings
with a jeweler named Stuart Steinman?

I knew they had trouble,
fake jewels and whatnot.

-You get involved in it?
-I had to. Part of the job.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.616
When’s the last time
you talked to Steinman?

24:52.991 --> 24:57.078
Gentlemen, I think you’re well aware
that I spoke with Mr. Steinman last night.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.414
Oh. You’re just a cut-to-the-chase
kind of guy, huh?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.832
All right. So, what did you talk about?

25:01.124 --> 25:03.126
-Drayno’s fake frog.
-What about it?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.921
That Steinman needed to replace it
like he had done with King Paul.

25:06.087 --> 25:09.799
-Or pay the money back. He got the point.
-After you threatened him?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.053
Why would I threaten a man
admitting he did wrong

25:13.136 --> 25:15.430
and promising to take care of the problem?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.599
Now, Steinman admitted it was fake?

25:18.099 --> 25:21.645
He did, like he did with King Paul.
And he said he’d make it right.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.105
But somehow, this morning,
he winds up shot.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.859
Well, obviously, Steinman
did some shady business.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.153
And I doubt we’re the only folks
that he tried to rip off.

25:30.403 --> 25:33.615
Or maybe I’m in here
because we’re the only Black folks.

You introduce your guys to Steinman?

25:56.263 --> 25:57.264
I did.

are you the lone psycho in the group,

with Steinman over Zionism

35:14.737 --> 35:16.114
You want to stay alive?

35:19.242 --> 35:20.118
Yes.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.037
Did Steinman figure out it was you

35:23.121 --> 35:25.623
that switched the jewels
on Drayno and King Paul?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.168
-Yes.
-He threaten to go to the police?

35:30.294 --> 35:31.796
-Yes.
-ANDY: So, you shot him.

35:33.631 --> 35:34.549
Yes or no?

35:35.299 --> 35:39.720
Yes, but you got to understand something.
In my industry, appearance is everything.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.765
You got an expensive lifestyle.
You ran short. You cooked up a scheme.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.350
It backfired. Is that where you going?

35:44.475 --> 35:48.020
You think it’s that simple,
that I got greedy? I came from nothing!

35:48.229 --> 35:50.523
I worked 20 hours a day
to get to where I am,

35:50.773 --> 35:53.818
Competing against Ivy-League white boys,
big management firms.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.444
I couldn’t just let that go.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.406
So, it was on the jeweler
to bankroll your cash-flow problem.

35:58.573 --> 36:02.118
-He had plenty. More than enough.
-You were way off.

36:03.828 --> 36:08.624
(SIGHS) I want administrative segregation
in the facility of my choosing.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.002
-This ain’t no record deal, pal.
-(NOTEPAD THUDDING)

36:16.716 --> 36:18.968
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:26.100 --> 36:28.853
-Got an update for you, Craig.
-Let’s hear it.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.606
After seeing what happened to his aunt,
Michael finally decided

36:31.689 --> 36:33.232
he couldn’t let it go anymore.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.693
-Sounds complicated.
-It’s not.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.113
He just gave a statement
about how he saw you kill his mom.

36:39.322 --> 36:43.201
(SCOFFS) You guys
and your tired-ass bluffs, man.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.705
You’re going in, Craig. This is it.

36:49.081 --> 36:52.251
And to the extent that you care,
I’ll be looking out for Michael.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.170
Not to get back at you...

36:54.921 --> 36:57.590
but because he’s a good kid
and deserves a chance.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.803
-So, Michael’s saying what now?
-One last thing...

37:04.430 --> 37:07.099
-I’m gonna make you a deal.
-(SCOFFS) Really?

37:08.684 --> 37:10.186
Don’t push this to trial.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.732
Don’t force Michael to testify
and relive this all over again.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.692
Let him go.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.195
What’s the deal part?

37:20.863 --> 37:22.198
If you agree to that...

37:22.949 --> 37:24.825
I’ll let you finish your cold beer...

37:25.785 --> 37:27.662
‘cause it’s the last one
you’re ever gonna have.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.131
Just keep in mind...

37:40.591 --> 37:42.343
if you break the deal,
I’ll call in a favor

37:42.426 --> 37:45.554
with the Department of Corrections,
and you’ll be in 23-hour lockdown

37:45.638 --> 37:49.225
for however many years you got left.
Or someone on your tier...

37:50.393 --> 37:52.186
I’ll help one of their family
members on the outside,

37:52.270 --> 37:54.397
and they’ll deal with you
whatever way they want.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.732
So, I want you to think about that beer.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.111
'Cause I’ll push a button on you,
and don’t think

38:00.236 --> 38:01.904
I won’t enjoy every second of it.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.289
If what you say is true...

38:12.915 --> 38:16.419
and Michael betrayed his own flesh
and blood and sided with a cop like you...

38:19.422 --> 38:23.676
(SMACKS LIPS) ...then he’s dead to me.
(GULPS)

38:24.844 --> 38:28.264
-(BOTTLE THUDDING)
-(GULPS) And he’s all yours.

38:30.933 --> 38:31.934
On your feet.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.325
So...

38:49.243 --> 38:50.411
this is nice.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.830
Yeah. Food’s good.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.585
-And we’re just sharing a meal, or...
-Maybe more than that.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.880
-It’s up to you.
-Isn’t this a little out of bounds?

39:01.088 --> 39:02.131
A boss and a subordinate

39:02.256 --> 39:03.966
from the same command
is very out of bounds.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.177
-But here we are.
-Yeah.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.181
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:11.182 --> 39:13.934
I don’t... I don’t know
how comfortable I am with it.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.771
With me or with the situation?

39:17.605 --> 39:19.940
I don’t like the idea
of keeping a secret in the squad.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.609
Well, what if you didn’t have to?

39:22.693 --> 39:24.236
I mean, what if the situation changed?

39:24.403 --> 39:26.364
That means someone transferring
out of the 15th.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.490
What if that happened?

39:27.823 --> 39:31.827
It’d look like we’d had an ongoing thing,
and that somebody transferred

39:31.911 --> 39:32.995
to make it ethical.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.875
(SIGHS) I don’t like people
talking behind my back.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.710
I’ve been through it too much.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.589
Well, say all that was off the table.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.176
No talking, no rumors.
We were free and clear.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.512
Would you want to spend more time with me?

39:49.637 --> 39:50.638
Free and clear?

39:51.764 --> 39:53.057
Yeah, I would.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.311
I’ve been approached
by this real estate developer

39:57.478 --> 40:00.523
about heading up his security.
I’m considering taking the job.

40:00.648 --> 40:01.649
'Cause of this?

40:01.732 --> 40:04.527
Because it’s a good opportunity,
and because losing the trial

40:04.610 --> 40:07.613
dropped the ceiling on how far
I’ll ever get on the job.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.242
When do you give your answer
to the developer?

40:11.700 --> 40:14.662
-By the end of the week.
-Hard to imagine you off the job.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.206
Think about it.

40:18.332 --> 40:19.417
I will.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.044
-Will you?
-Yeah.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.338
I will, too.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.561
This pulls out into a bed.

40:40.396 --> 40:41.772
The couch is fine.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.067
How you holding up?

40:45.401 --> 40:46.735
All right.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.072
You know, as far as...

40:50.739 --> 40:52.283
having to move out and...

40:53.200 --> 40:55.035
-you know, your Aunt Tammy...
-No.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.455
I got it.

41:00.332 --> 41:03.002
-So, what now?
-Crash here for a while.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.256
-How long’s a while?
-Long as you need.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.759
Well, I need...

41:12.470 --> 41:13.804
a place to live.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.233
I’ll get a dresser for you.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.403
Put it in the corner for your stuff.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.868
This is your home now if you want it.

41:37.077 --> 41:41.081
-You sure that’s cool with you?
-Michael, after seeing what you did today,

41:41.624 --> 41:44.126
it would be my privilege
to have you as a roommate.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.297
Okay.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.675
And I’ll start looking into it
paperwork-wise

41:51.759 --> 41:53.135
in order to make it official.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.476
I don’t want you worrying about anything.
