00:06.495 --> 00:09.513
<i>Walter Kendrick believes
that he can get away with anything.</i>

00:09.555 --> 00:13.405
Patty Hewes has just sued us
on behalf of a major UNR shareholder.

00:13.703 --> 00:14.403
Who?

00:14.445 --> 00:16.745
- I'm in this for me.
- Understood.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.976
This is the man
who was following me.

00:19.205 --> 00:21.473
- He's a cop.
- He must have {\been working}worked for Frobisher.

00:21.515 --> 00:23.959
No wonder they haven't gotten anywhere
with David's murder.

00:24.001 --> 00:25.433
This is my first real lead.

00:25.475 --> 00:26.803
Katie Connor saw you?

00:26.845 --> 00:28.033
What if she talks?

00:28.075 --> 00:30.196
We need to do what we should
have done a long time ago.

00:32.815 --> 00:35.868
Arthur Frobisher
had your fiancé killed, didn't he?

00:36.355 --> 00:38.455
She's been meeting with someone.

00:38.565 --> 00:40.832
Looks like law enforcement.
I think it's FBI.

00:40.995 --> 00:42.795
The merger's gone through.

00:43.135 --> 00:44.377
You ready on your end?

00:44.705 --> 00:46.305
Yeah. Let's get going.

00:47.145 --> 00:49.795
Kendrick overpaid
to acquire that company.

00:50.275 --> 00:53.493
Well, if he overpaid, he must have
a way to make that money back.

00:53.535 --> 00:55.685
We have to find out what that is.

- <i>Ellen, Uncle Pete.</i>

01:48.185 --> 01:50.185
<i>Uncle Pete's been with Patty
longer than any of us.</i>

01:50.227 --> 01:52.195
<i>He's {\*really }the one who runs
everything around here.</i>

02:43.065 --> 02:44.705
Thanks for the heads up, Ellen.

02:44.789 --> 02:48.139
We looked into Uncle Pete.
His full name is Peter McKee.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.045
Dishonorable discharge
from the Army in'49,

02:51.145 --> 02:53.798
with a criminal record
that goes back some 52 years.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.801
- A record for what?
- All sorts of petty stuff.

02:56.945 --> 02:58.345
Burglary, larceny,

02:58.775 --> 03:00.054
bribing a city official.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.854
20 years ago, he was arrested

03:02.896 --> 03:06.046
for using neighborhood kids
to run a numbers racket.

03:06.735 --> 03:09.647
- All charges were dismissed.
- And guess who his attorney was?

03:10.035 --> 03:11.985
- Patty Hewes.
- You got it.

03:12.475 --> 03:15.444
And there's been no record of him
breaking the law ever since.

03:16.245 --> 03:18.545
Pete's been by her side for decades.

03:19.105 --> 03:21.126
I can't believe
I didn't think of this sooner.

03:21.168 --> 03:21.868
No.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.411
We're getting somewhere, Ellen.

03:23.785 --> 03:24.785
If...

03:24.945 --> 03:26.095
Pete McKee...

03:26.755 --> 03:29.128
knows where Patty's skeletons
are buried,

03:29.404 --> 03:30.418
we'll find them.

03:39.719 --> 03:40.887
Thanks to Valpi.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.210
www.seriestele.net

04:13.565 --> 04:17.563
I've arranged a press conference
to announce you as my lead plaintiff.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.505
I've written down some words

04:19.625 --> 04:21.274
that I'd like you to...

04:22.095 --> 04:23.245
say about me.

04:34.055 --> 04:35.855
Don't you think this is...

04:36.215 --> 04:37.735
pouring it on a bit thick?

04:38.295 --> 04:40.195
You destroyed my reputation.

04:40.275 --> 04:41.525
I want it back.

04:42.335 --> 04:44.485
You're the only one
who can give it to me.

04:44.815 --> 04:46.965
So, that's why you're doing this?

04:47.685 --> 04:50.385
- For your image?
- No, I didn't say image.

04:51.175 --> 04:53.084
I said reputation.
There's a difference.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.242
Ever since I got out
of the hospital,

04:58.275 --> 05:01.790
I've sought the counsel
of a spiritual advisor.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.285
- Really?
- Yes.

05:05.025 --> 05:06.475
I have clarity now.

05:09.295 --> 05:10.695
I made mistakes...

05:11.825 --> 05:13.375
and I can admit that.

05:13.875 --> 05:15.275
That's big of you.

05:19.635 --> 05:21.385
But I'm no Walt Kendrick.

05:22.955 --> 05:26.455
Now, that guy is a destructive force.
He tears things down.

05:26.925 --> 05:30.125
He rapes the environment for profit.
I don't do that.

05:31.845 --> 05:33.045
I'm a builder.

05:34.325 --> 05:37.325
Well, if you're going to
rebuild your reputation,

05:38.295 --> 05:41.542
a few kind words from me
at a press conference won't be enough.

05:41.584 --> 05:44.552
- The other side is going to attack you.
- I know how these things work.

05:44.695 --> 05:47.416
And based on our previous
experience together,

05:47.458 --> 05:51.142
I'm sure you'll understand why
it's necessary to vet your financials.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.335
Fair enough.
You can have anything you want.

05:54.815 --> 05:56.465
I have nothing to hide.

05:57.455 --> 05:58.455
Good.

06:00.425 --> 06:01.425
Come in.

06:03.095 --> 06:04.945
Patty, you wanted to see...

06:06.053 --> 06:07.053
Arthur,

06:07.095 --> 06:10.345
I'm not sure you remember
my associate, Ellen Parsons.

06:11.275 --> 06:12.375
Oh, yes. Hi.

06:13.285 --> 06:16.985
Mr. Frobisher's going to be
our lead plaintiff in the UNR case.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.575
I can't take this noise.

06:30.105 --> 06:32.366
This noise is
the closest thing there is

06:32.408 --> 06:34.477
to musical epic poetry.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.585
I wanna keep going.

06:40.865 --> 06:42.568
One more bump, that's it.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.575
You have to pace yourself.

06:53.839 --> 06:54.789
Oh, shit!

07:01.004 --> 07:01.754
Damn it!

07:04.715 --> 07:05.765
No running!

07:06.375 --> 07:08.514
Andrew, stop the horseplay.

07:09.885 --> 07:10.995
He's a wild man.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.465
Listen to this, Allison.

07:14.845 --> 07:17.738
A male sea lion can weigh
up to 700 pounds.

07:18.265 --> 07:19.265
So?

07:19.825 --> 07:22.563
They can hold their breath
for 15 minutes,

07:22.605 --> 07:24.355
dive over 500 feet,

07:24.485 --> 07:27.363
and reach a speed
of 25 miles per hour.

07:27.995 --> 07:28.995
So?

07:29.245 --> 07:32.076
That's a remarkably
efficient use of resources.

07:33.275 --> 07:34.825
Seals are stupid.

07:35.415 --> 07:37.081
Sea lions.
These are sea lions.

07:37.485 --> 07:40.251
They've lived in New York
since before you were born.

07:40.975 --> 07:42.775
I hate coming to New York.

07:43.225 --> 07:44.225
Why?

07:44.395 --> 07:45.631
New York sucks.

07:48.265 --> 07:50.532
You know, when your great-great
grandfather left Scotland,

07:50.574 --> 07:51.846
he came to New York.

07:52.295 --> 07:53.295
So?

07:53.565 --> 07:55.103
It's the land of opportunity.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.345
If a man is honest and works hard,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.323
if he's productive,

07:59.365 --> 08:01.313
there's no telling
what he can accomplish here.

08:12.035 --> 08:13.617
Go play with your cousins, Ally.

08:16.765 --> 08:19.003
What is it, Dave?
I'm with my grandkids.

08:19.045 --> 08:21.250
<i>The trader got busted with a hooker.</i>

08:22.875 --> 08:25.203
- He was arrested?
- There was a mishap.

08:25.245 --> 08:27.089
He was with a girl.
They were partying.

08:27.305 --> 08:29.505
- So, the trade didn't go through?
- No.

08:30.655 --> 08:32.455
We'll try again this week.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.155
Find someone new.

08:34.655 --> 08:35.722
I can't do that.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.115
- Find someone new.
- He screwed up.

08:39.155 --> 08:41.755
But he's in a unique position
to help us.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.283
I have restless shareholders
and a goddamn lawsuit against me.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.425
I am not going to risk exposure.

08:48.685 --> 08:52.685
You're on the national stage now, Walt,
which is exactly where you wanted to be.

08:52.925 --> 08:55.943
If you didn't take risks,
you'd be back in Appalachia

08:55.985 --> 08:58.135
ruling over the toothless masses.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.135
Look...

09:03.395 --> 09:06.545
The incident was unfortunate.
It won't happen again.

09:07.325 --> 09:09.210
I've had his name
taken off the police report,

09:09.252 --> 09:11.091
but we have to take care
of the girl.

09:11.515 --> 09:13.065
Take care of her how?

09:13.355 --> 09:15.005
We need a lawyer, Walt.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.775
One we can trust.

09:24.995 --> 09:26.945
You've drifted. Stay present.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.782
Your breath is shallow.
You're not focused.

09:37.555 --> 09:40.205
I'm struggling
with this press conference.

09:41.395 --> 09:42.645
In what regard?

09:44.155 --> 09:47.855
Am I getting involved with
these people for the right reason?

09:48.995 --> 09:50.145
Right, wrong.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.525
What are your reasons?

09:53.895 --> 09:55.195
I made mistakes.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.665
I'd like to use my talents, my...

10:00.755 --> 10:01.755
my gifts,

10:02.625 --> 10:04.025
to correct things.

10:05.455 --> 10:09.155
Arthur, if you want to change the world,
first change yourself.

10:09.255 --> 10:12.255
Then your part in changing
the world is finished.

10:16.105 --> 10:18.005
I don't think I'm there yet.

10:18.365 --> 10:20.965
It's a monumental task,
changing oneself.

10:23.445 --> 10:25.291
You need to become
more self-centered.

10:27.575 --> 10:29.475
I'm pretty selfish as it is.

10:29.543 --> 10:30.543
Not selfish.

10:30.585 --> 10:32.135
Focused on self.

10:32.755 --> 10:35.185
One's aim should be
to know oneself truly,

10:35.227 --> 10:37.302
apart from one's place in the world.

10:43.445 --> 10:46.395
I may have to have you
explain that to me again.

10:48.175 --> 10:49.175
Breathe.

10:50.585 --> 10:52.635
Frobisher had my fiancé killed.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.925
Rage without focus isn't a strategy.

11:00.025 --> 11:03.783
Frobisher is the only shareholder
who is willing to sue right now.

11:03.825 --> 11:06.913
We don't always have the luxury
of choosing our friends.

11:06.955 --> 11:09.985
If we keep Frobisher close to us,

11:11.135 --> 11:14.535
we may be able to get information
that can help you prove

11:14.785 --> 11:16.592
he was involved in David's murder.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.295
You should have asked me first.

11:23.085 --> 11:24.235
But I didn't.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.125
Shit.

11:40.355 --> 11:41.565
<i>Dupeczka!</i>

11:41.925 --> 11:42.925
Coming!

11:43.485 --> 11:44.485
Jesus.

11:46.025 --> 11:47.573
<i>Now, if you're on a diet,</i>

11:47.615 --> 11:49.953
<i>chicken, fish or meat, high protein,</i>

11:49.995 --> 11:52.480
<i>well, that's what this machine does,
chicken, fish or meat.</i>

11:53.115 --> 11:55.465
One infomercial,
you're a fiber Nazi.

11:57.565 --> 11:58.915
This is bullshit.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.183
What are we {\still }kicking up to McKee for?
The guy's 100 years old.

12:02.225 --> 12:03.175
Shut up.

12:03.217 --> 12:05.432
He's like a grandfather to me.
Show some respect.

12:08.015 --> 12:09.269
If you go to Key Food,

12:10.295 --> 12:12.395
please pick up some fresh fruit.

12:13.555 --> 12:15.055
You got it, sweetie.

12:20.905 --> 12:22.005
Hey, fellas.

12:22.185 --> 12:24.326
I'll have another shipment
for you next week.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.500
All right,
the guy in the track suit...

12:33.445 --> 12:34.853
That's Timothy McAdams.

12:34.895 --> 12:37.464
And the other guy,
that's Michael O'Shea.

12:37.855 --> 12:39.758
Now, both of those guys
got rap sheets.

12:43.065 --> 12:45.015
Looks like we found a way in.

12:50.505 --> 12:53.183
It's an improvement.
You got some body shots in.

12:53.225 --> 12:54.623
This one came close.

12:54.665 --> 12:57.068
If you were attacked by a guy
wearing epaulets...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.410
Fuckin' asshole.

12:58.452 --> 12:59.552
I'm serious.

13:00.695 --> 13:03.293
If I were Sergeant Pepper,
I'd be terrified.

13:03.335 --> 13:05.683
It is your fault if I suck,
by the way,

13:05.725 --> 13:08.325
- 'cause you're supposed to {\be teaching}teach me.
- I'm trying.

13:08.835 --> 13:11.535
How do you know so much
about guns, anyway?

13:12.155 --> 13:13.405
My dad was a...

13:14.085 --> 13:15.335
a violent dude.

13:16.083 --> 13:17.033
A Marine.

13:17.075 --> 13:19.475
I shot my first gun
when I was eight.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.923
He took me and my brother
into the woods,

13:21.965 --> 13:24.065
gave us a Bushmaster A3,

13:25.105 --> 13:27.514
preached the doctrine of
"One shot, one kill".

13:33.625 --> 13:36.575
You making any progress
on that Frobisher thing?

13:36.655 --> 13:38.455
Let's not talk about that.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.125
I want to hear more about you.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.205
Like what?

13:42.825 --> 13:44.475
I don't know. Anything.

13:51.945 --> 13:54.045
What are we doing here, Parsons?

13:54.955 --> 13:56.213
What do you mean?

13:56.255 --> 13:57.543
You know what I mean.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.221
Let's have dinner or something.

14:01.825 --> 14:05.219
I'd like to have a conversation with you
that doesn't involve firearms.

14:06.535 --> 14:08.385
You know my situation, I...

14:08.785 --> 14:10.235
And I respect that.

14:11.495 --> 14:15.270
But we both know what's going on here,
I don't wanna dance around it anymore.

14:18.045 --> 14:20.295
Hey, look, if it's just me, say so.

14:21.185 --> 14:22.819
I won't bring it up again.

14:30.275 --> 14:31.375
That's fine.

14:33.135 --> 14:35.585
- I'm sorry, Wes.
- No, don't.

14:37.035 --> 14:38.185
I understand.

14:40.975 --> 14:42.475
Same time next week?

14:44.095 --> 14:45.145
Yeah, sure.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.575
This is definitely him.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.743
When I filed my complaint
with Internal Affairs...

14:59.785 --> 15:02.043
The wrong person must
have found out about it.

15:02.085 --> 15:04.236
Someone decided
this guy is a liability.

15:05.085 --> 15:06.835
We've lost our only lead.

15:10.655 --> 15:12.573
I should have listened to you.

15:12.615 --> 15:14.915
I don't blame you for being anxious.

15:16.465 --> 15:19.918
David's dead,
and Frobisher's still out there, but...

15:21.125 --> 15:22.925
These are powerful people.

15:23.565 --> 15:26.800
There's clearly corruption.
We can't go through the normal channels.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.475
And we can't turn on each other.

15:33.195 --> 15:35.295
What else do you know about him?

15:35.895 --> 15:39.153
Patty's investigator found out
he moonlighted for a security firm,

15:39.195 --> 15:41.045
<i>Calder Protective Services.</i>

15:41.375 --> 15:45.075
We're still finding out exactly
what kind of work he did there.

15:49.965 --> 15:51.165
Mr. Frobisher.

15:58.285 --> 16:00.167
What the hell are you doing here?

16:00.805 --> 16:02.913
You're gonna pull out
of this lawsuit.

16:02.955 --> 16:04.455
How did you find me?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.883
And you're gonna stop
all contact with Patty Hewes.

16:08.785 --> 16:11.035
No, actually, I'm not.

16:11.755 --> 16:14.355
How is this any of
your goddamn business?

16:15.555 --> 16:18.005
You need to be
very careful right now.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.845
- You don't want to be in the spotlight.
- Why is that?

16:21.939 --> 16:23.899
Katie Connor is back in the picture.

16:27.915 --> 16:29.714
No, I'm through with that.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.515
No, I've moved on.

16:32.485 --> 16:33.992
You don't get to do that.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.384
Look, asshole,

16:36.065 --> 16:38.343
I've been through
some really rough shit recently.

16:38.385 --> 16:40.135
I'm not that guy anymore.

16:40.595 --> 16:42.695
You started this, Mr. Frobisher.

16:43.155 --> 16:44.673
The decision was yours.

16:44.715 --> 16:46.505
No one forced you to make it.

16:47.765 --> 16:49.315
You said so yourself.

16:50.255 --> 16:52.105
Once you go down this road,

16:52.255 --> 16:53.512
there's no turning back.

16:56.465 --> 16:57.465
Watch me.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.142
Your Honor, the defendant was caught

17:07.184 --> 17:09.164
with more than an eighth
of an ounce of cocaine,

17:09.205 --> 17:10.987
which she readily admits was hers.

17:11.565 --> 17:12.864
That's a class E felony.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.353
We don't dispute that,

17:14.395 --> 17:17.285
but my client has no prior
felony drug convictions.

17:17.444 --> 17:19.395
This is a first-time offense.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.823
How about her two arrests
for prostitution?

17:21.865 --> 17:25.214
You saw her record.
You know both counts were dismissed.

17:26.105 --> 17:28.755
Your Honor, Ms. Samble
works as an escort.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.092
The service she provides
is purely social.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.226
Regardless,

17:33.765 --> 17:36.263
her profession is immaterial here.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.375
Agreed.

17:37.495 --> 17:40.058
Stick to the facts, counsel.
And make sure they're relevant.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.742
Thank you, Your Honor.

17:41.865 --> 17:42.915
Ms. Samble.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.675
Do you plead guilty to this offense?

17:47.975 --> 17:49.325
I do, Your Honor.

17:50.765 --> 17:54.765
In light of this being Ms. Samble's
first possession charge, Your Honor,

17:55.065 --> 17:56.683
I beg the court's leniency.

17:56.725 --> 17:58.325
All right, Ms. Maddox.

17:58.755 --> 18:00.705
Defendant is given probation,

18:01.395 --> 18:04.207
but if it happens again,
it will be jail time.

18:16.535 --> 18:19.035
My grandchildren are here
for the rest of the week.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.016
What do you do
with kids in this city?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.924
There's a reason
I don't have children.

18:23.735 --> 18:26.385
Take 'em to a movie.
That'll shut them up.

18:26.585 --> 18:29.441
Do you want to tell me
what I was doing in that courtroom?

18:34.355 --> 18:35.405
I'm sorry, Claire.

18:35.515 --> 18:39.415
The john's name was blacked out
on the police report. Was that you?

18:41.805 --> 18:43.963
I won't ask a favor like this again,

18:44.005 --> 18:46.003
but you were the only one
I could trust with it.

18:46.045 --> 18:47.603
I don't care about the favor,

18:47.645 --> 18:50.793
but you can't be out cavorting
in the middle of a major lawsuit.

18:50.835 --> 18:52.235
I get the message.

18:57.045 --> 18:59.679
And we need to discuss
Frobisher's press conference.

18:59.795 --> 19:03.795
Frobisher is just more bullshit media
attention to keep the stock down.

19:04.195 --> 19:06.443
- All they want is a settlement.
- No.

19:06.485 --> 19:08.213
Patty's not looking for a quick hit,

19:08.255 --> 19:10.213
and Frobisher isn't in this
for the money.

19:10.255 --> 19:12.255
He's back to salvage his name.

19:12.815 --> 19:15.815
This is going to be a long,
drawn-out proceeding.

19:16.905 --> 19:20.105
- What are you suggesting?
- Get the stock prices up.

19:20.255 --> 19:21.805
Do whatever it takes.

19:21.885 --> 19:23.985
I've already lined up investors.

19:25.035 --> 19:28.685
We're going to have a significant
influx of capital very soon,

19:29.805 --> 19:32.170
and we'll make up
the merger deficit.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.175
And you were going to tell me
about this when?

19:38.215 --> 19:39.865
When the deal was done.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.645
Which it will be soon.

19:43.925 --> 19:47.525
I can't do my job, Walt,
if I don't have all the information.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.113
Once we get that capital,

19:49.155 --> 19:52.505
the stock will rebound
and this lawsuit will be history.

19:58.033 --> 19:59.115
What happened?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.522
We got to try again.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.202
The trader screwed up.

20:09.713 --> 20:10.552
Yeah?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.786
Claire Maddox was defending
a woman on cocaine charges.

20:13.828 --> 20:16.646
I looked into her.
She works for an escort service.

20:19.605 --> 20:22.052
Why would the lead counsel

20:22.440 --> 20:26.181
of an energy company be defending
a hooker on a drug bust?

20:26.393 --> 20:27.473
I have no idea.

20:27.599 --> 20:29.555
Couldn't find any connection to UNR.

20:29.597 --> 20:31.057
So I checked the police report.

20:31.099 --> 20:33.449
There was someone else in the car

20:33.491 --> 20:35.472
when the escort was arrested.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.444
- A john?
- That would be my guess.

20:39.525 --> 20:42.247
The name was redacted
from the police report.

20:43.101 --> 20:45.865
So, this escort is taking
the fall for someone.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.324
She must be.

20:48.911 --> 20:50.638
Find her.
Run it down.

21:59.758 --> 22:02.606
Arthur Frobisher is
a great American.

22:03.656 --> 22:04.521
Recently,

22:04.877 --> 22:08.215
I've had the opportunity to get
to know the private man, and

22:08.732 --> 22:11.933
and I have been
deeply impressed by his character

22:11.975 --> 22:13.144
and his resolve.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.542
I have come to see

22:15.855 --> 22:18.319
that he is by nature a builder.

22:19.106 --> 22:21.228
He is an inspiring human being

22:21.420 --> 22:23.801
whose passion in life is to create,

22:24.159 --> 22:25.343
not destroy.

22:26.105 --> 22:29.526
I am pleased that we have
set aside our differences

22:29.815 --> 22:31.375
and I am proud

22:31.417 --> 22:35.154
that I can count
Arthur Frobisher my friend

22:35.319 --> 22:36.846
and my partner...

22:37.177 --> 22:38.855
in this great cause.

22:42.711 --> 22:44.154
Thank you, Patty.

22:46.984 --> 22:49.909
This case is about greed,

22:49.993 --> 22:51.036
pure and simple.

22:51.293 --> 22:53.155
It's about a CEO,

22:53.775 --> 22:55.632
Walter Kendrick,

22:56.321 --> 22:58.791
who has circumvented every safety

22:58.833 --> 23:01.985
and environmental regulation
on the books

23:02.645 --> 23:05.662
and engineered
a catastrophic merger,

23:05.704 --> 23:09.452
all to increase
his personal base of power

23:10.454 --> 23:13.420
at the expense of his shareholders.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.874
Now, the fact is that I,

23:17.245 --> 23:20.736
I was so impressed, years ago,
with Mr. Kendrick's vision

23:21.727 --> 23:24.611
that I became a major stockholder
in his company.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.194
But time has tested Mr. Kendrick

23:29.158 --> 23:31.112
and he's failed that test. So,

23:31.369 --> 23:35.692
now, as a person who has
a stake in this company,

23:36.782 --> 23:39.823
I feel it's my duty
to hold him accountable.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.669
And that's why I'm here today.

23:48.113 --> 23:50.386
"Every man deserves the best".

23:58.769 --> 24:00.365
What kind of work do you do?

24:03.351 --> 24:04.761
Does it make a difference?

24:06.316 --> 24:07.445
Not a bit.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.307
So...

24:11.215 --> 24:13.326
what do you like, mystery man?

24:13.940 --> 24:15.296
I just want to talk.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.744
One of those.

24:20.382 --> 24:22.001
It's gonna cost you the same.

24:25.606 --> 24:26.638
There you go.

24:29.170 --> 24:32.748
No offense,
but I was hoping to see Susie tonight.

24:33.987 --> 24:36.230
Susie's a very busy girl.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.376
But she only sees a few customers.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.689
Does she have regulars?

24:43.629 --> 24:44.899
We all do.

24:45.492 --> 24:47.528
Do you happen to know
some of her regulars?

24:47.927 --> 24:50.029
I don't talk about other clients.

24:53.716 --> 24:55.477
Susie got arrested the other night.

24:55.882 --> 24:57.431
Don't know if you knew about that.

24:57.473 --> 24:59.984
Was she with one of her regulars?

25:08.198 --> 25:10.386
His name's Finn Garrety.

25:10.428 --> 25:12.659
I saw him a couple of times.
He's a creep.

25:13.061 --> 25:14.884
But Susie doesn't seem to mind.

25:15.095 --> 25:16.358
He takes care of her.

25:17.354 --> 25:19.259
Thank you very much, Gabriella.

25:22.458 --> 25:23.999
- Thanks for the drink.
- Wait.

25:25.032 --> 25:26.303
You're all paid up.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.111
You sure you don't want to stay?

25:37.361 --> 25:38.494
You wanted to see me?

25:40.252 --> 25:42.264
Discovery for the UNR case.

25:43.187 --> 25:46.502
The only reason we filed this suit was
to get our hands on those documents.

25:46.626 --> 25:48.146
What are we looking for exactly?

25:48.188 --> 25:49.660
E-mails, memos,

25:49.702 --> 25:53.059
anything that gets behind
Kendrick's real motives for the merger.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.111
Tom's supervising.
I want you to...

25:56.697 --> 25:57.597
assist.

25:58.314 --> 25:59.314
All right.

26:00.154 --> 26:01.904
Hope I'm not interrupting.

26:02.438 --> 26:04.503
Stefania wanted you to have this.

26:07.189 --> 26:07.982
Try one.

26:08.453 --> 26:09.430
What is it?

26:09.595 --> 26:10.951
Polish pastry.

26:12.073 --> 26:14.739
Uncle Pete's wife makes it.
You'll never taste anything better.

26:15.070 --> 26:16.658
I didn't know you were married.

26:17.752 --> 26:19.052
Almost 60 years.

26:20.065 --> 26:20.842
Enjoy.

26:21.692 --> 26:22.842
Thanks, Pete.

26:33.644 --> 26:35.345
How long have you known Uncle Pete?

26:36.308 --> 26:37.454
Since I was a kid.

26:40.270 --> 26:41.681
Is he really your uncle?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.929
He's my mother's brother.

26:44.981 --> 26:47.596
And the most loyal
man I'll ever know.

26:55.607 --> 26:57.146
- What's up, fellas?
- What's up?

26:57.188 --> 26:58.550
How was the ride from Jersey?

26:58.949 --> 27:00.450
You know the tunnel.

27:00.999 --> 27:02.605
We heard good things about you guys.

27:02.647 --> 27:05.045
Said you move shit quick,
always pay in cash.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.891
Well, let's see it.

27:10.607 --> 27:12.983
You got bonus features,
original artwork,

27:13.561 --> 27:14.442
everything.

27:15.075 --> 27:16.801
It's good shit.
Where'd you get it?

27:17.649 --> 27:18.825
It fell off a truck.

27:21.985 --> 27:23.016
How much?

27:24.648 --> 27:27.559
You take it all,
I'll give it to you for nine grand even.

27:29.025 --> 27:30.002
Seven.

27:30.277 --> 27:32.525
Come on,
you can offload this for 20, easy.

27:32.850 --> 27:35.314
We got seven grand right here,
you want it or not?

27:39.228 --> 27:40.095
All right.

27:40.274 --> 27:41.075
Count it.

27:44.287 --> 27:45.486
Don't bother.

28:20.814 --> 28:22.013
Pete McKee?

28:23.181 --> 28:24.101
FBI.

28:24.143 --> 28:26.120
What do you say we do this quietly?

28:26.406 --> 28:28.081
I was just talking with my pals.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.333
Yeah, I know. I heard every word.

28:33.699 --> 28:35.750
Three grand is a nice
little payoff, huh?

28:36.066 --> 28:37.048
Come on.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.761
How's it feel to have
a buddy flipped on you?

28:43.914 --> 28:45.737
Congratulations, Uncle Pete.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.781
You've graduated to racketeering.

28:49.292 --> 28:52.429
And when stolen merchandise
crosses state lines,

28:52.677 --> 28:54.135
you get to talk to the Feds.

28:54.177 --> 28:55.608
And we got two options for you.

28:56.464 --> 28:58.673
Well, he's not gonna
like the first option.

28:58.820 --> 28:59.622
Nope.

28:59.664 --> 29:02.330
Ten years in prison,
250 large in fines.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.085
No takers?

29:08.287 --> 29:09.615
The man's not interested.

29:09.657 --> 29:11.548
Tell him what's behind
door number two.

29:11.590 --> 29:13.175
You go home to your wife.

29:13.217 --> 29:15.670
You live out the rest
of your days together.

29:15.781 --> 29:17.663
You'll be there with Stefania...

29:18.582 --> 29:20.544
When she dies of lung disease.

29:25.782 --> 29:26.782
What's the catch?

29:27.842 --> 29:29.350
You give us Patty Hewes.

29:30.967 --> 29:32.346
This is about Patty?

29:32.896 --> 29:36.062
Of course, if you don't have
anything on Patty, then...

29:36.104 --> 29:37.548
option two goes away.

29:38.282 --> 29:40.285
And you go straight to jail.

29:44.970 --> 29:47.282
Sorry, fellas.
I've got nothing for you.

29:51.468 --> 29:52.182
Pete...

29:52.953 --> 29:55.585
Do you really think Patty
gives a shit about you?

29:56.032 --> 29:59.880
You have no idea. I'd be a bum
on the street. I'd be dead

29:59.965 --> 30:03.612
if it wasn't for that woman.
You sons of bitches!

30:03.832 --> 30:05.112
You have no idea.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.312
I understand.

30:07.645 --> 30:08.353
But...

30:08.553 --> 30:10.600
you're gonna have to screw somebody.

30:11.035 --> 30:12.387
Now, who's it gonna be?

30:15.870 --> 30:18.733
How long do you think Stefania's
got left to live, anyway?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.221
Oh, God...

30:20.410 --> 30:22.489
Three, four months tops.

30:24.159 --> 30:25.480
Shame on you!

30:25.810 --> 30:27.030
Yeah, shame on us.

30:27.658 --> 30:29.540
But are you gonna give us Patty?

30:30.090 --> 30:32.573
Or are you gonna
abandon your dying wife?

30:39.912 --> 30:41.249
What do I have to do?

30:41.715 --> 30:42.684
It's simple.

30:42.973 --> 30:46.928
You tell Patty you got busted,
you need some cash to pay off the cops.

30:47.542 --> 30:50.014
She says yes, you get it on tape,
we're in business.

30:51.803 --> 30:52.672
No.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.794
If I'm going to do this to Patty,

30:55.836 --> 30:58.491
I can't see her again.
I couldn't look her in the eye.

30:59.719 --> 31:01.508
All right, then what do you suggest?

31:02.609 --> 31:04.147
I have evidence.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.105
Evidence that will put her away.

31:09.805 --> 31:11.035
Where is the evidence?

31:11.263 --> 31:12.588
In a storage locker.

31:13.163 --> 31:14.759
I got the key at my house.

31:16.914 --> 31:18.419
All right, Pete.

31:19.155 --> 31:20.050
Let's go.

31:20.787 --> 31:21.737
No, wait.

31:23.242 --> 31:25.382
My wife will wonder where I went.

31:25.761 --> 31:27.856
Can I pick up some strawberries?

31:30.876 --> 31:32.858
We can get some strawberries.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.273
Did you have fun with your hooker?

31:42.287 --> 31:44.723
We talked, we shared some laughs.

31:45.728 --> 31:46.737
Is that all?

31:47.899 --> 31:49.055
I was home by 10:00.

31:49.413 --> 31:51.685
It's okay if I fact-check
that with Deb?

31:52.454 --> 31:55.245
Look, the important
thing is I got us a name.

31:57.667 --> 31:58.817
Finn Garrety.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.269
Do I know who this is?

32:00.355 --> 32:03.309
Holds a doctorate in Advanced
Economic Theory from MIT.

32:03.351 --> 32:06.468
Youngest guy ever to be
offered a full professorship.

32:06.542 --> 32:08.290
Turned it down
to work on Wall Street.

32:08.332 --> 32:09.473
Real maverick.

32:09.515 --> 32:11.689
Also a bit of a head case.

32:12.102 --> 32:13.973
Garrety is a commodities trader.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.225
So what's Walter
Kendrick's interest in him?

32:16.459 --> 32:18.034
That's the kicker.

32:19.817 --> 32:21.389
He trades exclusively...

32:22.879 --> 32:24.765
in the energy market.

32:40.515 --> 32:41.946
T minus

32:42.648 --> 32:43.586
15 seconds.

32:46.104 --> 32:47.104
Houston...

32:47.751 --> 32:49.091
Ain't gonna be no no problem.

32:52.085 --> 32:52.939
Three...

32:53.131 --> 32:53.932
Two...

32:54.549 --> 32:55.556
One...

32:56.159 --> 32:56.995
2:00.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.746
Finn, what was all that about?

33:03.508 --> 33:05.399
You're asking the questions now?

33:06.245 --> 33:07.193
Just wondering.

33:07.278 --> 33:09.487
If you really want to know,
that was about money, babe.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.827
It's all about money.

33:11.582 --> 33:12.957
I like that.

33:13.164 --> 33:13.931
Good.

33:14.684 --> 33:16.226
Now turn around and face the wall.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.010
We've got a lot of work to do.

33:22.831 --> 33:23.850
We're good.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.022
The trade went through.

33:26.656 --> 33:27.536
All right.

33:27.984 --> 33:28.984
I'll be in touch.

33:34.403 --> 33:35.307
Okay.

33:36.230 --> 33:38.315
So, who's up for some
ice cream after lunch?

33:38.357 --> 33:39.433
Yeah!

33:39.546 --> 33:42.162
We scoured Frobisher's
financial records,

33:42.340 --> 33:43.813
and ran a background check.

33:44.985 --> 33:47.972
I'm afraid nothing pointed
directly to David's murder.

33:48.647 --> 33:51.070
But we did find
something interesting.

33:52.693 --> 33:54.314
For the past decade,

33:54.575 --> 33:57.243
Frobisher's had a high-end
security firm on retainer.

33:58.358 --> 34:01.286
The same firm your missing
policeman moonlighted for.

34:01.878 --> 34:03.763
Calder Protective Services.

34:05.486 --> 34:06.736
We have a lead.

34:08.331 --> 34:10.699
Because we took
Frobisher on as a client.

34:16.735 --> 34:17.735
Thank you, Patty.

34:24.110 --> 34:26.933
Special Agents Randall
Harrison and L.J. Werner.

34:29.204 --> 34:30.610
Definitely FBI.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.208
Ellen Parsons is a lawyer.

34:33.469 --> 34:36.083
A thousand reasons why she's
meeting with these guys.

34:36.607 --> 34:38.868
Then why the sudden interest
in learning how to shoot?

34:39.222 --> 34:40.444
She's scared.

34:40.485 --> 34:41.721
She wants protection.

34:42.969 --> 34:45.197
And what about the missing cop?
She still pursuing that?

34:45.239 --> 34:46.292
I don't know.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.380
I can't get her to talk about it.

34:49.233 --> 34:50.360
You can't?

34:52.243 --> 34:54.101
Maybe I should
take you off this thing,

34:54.417 --> 34:55.760
stick you someplace else.

35:00.174 --> 35:01.514
Okay, look,

35:02.697 --> 35:04.693
you slipped up here, right?

35:05.188 --> 35:07.175
I'm sure it feels like
you're walking around,

35:07.409 --> 35:08.840
and your dick's hanging out.

35:09.176 --> 35:10.470
It's no fun. I get it.

35:11.303 --> 35:12.401
But trust me.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.645
She's not talking
revenge anymore, right?

35:14.907 --> 35:16.576
So let me play this my way.

35:16.957 --> 35:18.114
What way is that?

35:20.315 --> 35:21.482
Ellen isn't stupid.

35:22.239 --> 35:24.914
If I push too hard, she'll shut down,
but if I just...

35:25.666 --> 35:26.808
step back,

35:28.679 --> 35:29.863
she'll come to me.

35:31.088 --> 35:32.942
Then I can get her to open up.

35:35.131 --> 35:36.886
All right, whatever.
It's not my decision.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.056
You're right.

35:39.708 --> 35:40.753
It's not.

35:42.735 --> 35:45.263
If Parsons isn't talking,
you'll have to try someone else.

35:46.865 --> 35:47.565
Who?

35:48.492 --> 35:49.642
Katie Connor.

35:50.411 --> 35:53.823
- I told you Frobisher hired that guy.
- We still don't have proof of that.

35:53.865 --> 35:55.761
We need to look into
the security firm.

35:55.803 --> 35:58.155
- But we're getting somewhere.
- I understand.

36:01.809 --> 36:02.993
I don't believe it.

36:03.639 --> 36:04.507
What?

36:06.460 --> 36:07.373
Krulik!

36:11.836 --> 36:12.878
You know him?

36:13.201 --> 36:14.712
From grief counseling.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.507
This is weird.

36:17.741 --> 36:19.605
Well, that's the great
thing about New York.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.209
You can run into anyone.

36:22.888 --> 36:24.581
No! No, it's not like that.

36:24.623 --> 36:27.910
I had a boyfriend.
We just broke up recently, you know.

36:28.667 --> 36:29.582
That's rough.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.267
It just didn't feel right.

36:32.508 --> 36:34.562
It's hard to know
when you're really ready.

36:35.012 --> 36:36.884
I think I'm ready for something now,

36:36.926 --> 36:40.698
but with Mark,
it was just a little too soon.

36:42.099 --> 36:42.882
Shit.

36:43.559 --> 36:45.327
I have to take this.
I'll be right back.

36:45.692 --> 36:46.600
Okay.

36:49.985 --> 36:50.955
What is it?

36:51.354 --> 36:53.721
<i>Pete's not going to be
in the office tomorrow.</i>

36:55.015 --> 36:56.141
You arrested him?

36:56.183 --> 36:56.883
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:57.165 --> 37:00.096
<i>And by the end of the night,
we should have what we need on Patty.</i>

37:01.119 --> 37:02.530
Thanks for the heads up.

37:14.872 --> 37:16.229
I was getting worried.

37:17.358 --> 37:18.941
Sorry I didn't call, sweetie.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.757
I brought you some more fruit.

37:22.725 --> 37:24.693
These are Patty's clients.

37:24.968 --> 37:27.625
Sweetie,
I got to get something from the kitchen.

37:28.024 --> 37:31.165
If you don't mind,
keep these fellows company, will you?

37:34.312 --> 37:36.144
Would you like a strawberry?

37:36.295 --> 37:37.945
Where is this storage unit?

37:37.987 --> 37:39.266
Ten minutes away.

37:39.308 --> 37:40.729
McGinness and Freeman.

37:41.165 --> 37:43.078
I got the key here somewhere.

37:53.785 --> 37:55.602
There's a trunk in the storage unit.

37:56.414 --> 37:58.619
It holds everything I got on Patty.

37:58.823 --> 37:59.902
I'll take you there.

38:00.571 --> 38:02.583
You're doing the right thing,
Mr. McKee.

38:05.064 --> 38:06.520
I gotta hit the can.

38:07.114 --> 38:09.620
I gotta give Stefania
her medication before I leave.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.613
Leave the door open.

38:20.339 --> 38:23.063
- What is case?
- It's a securities case.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.414
Stocks.

38:25.377 --> 38:26.788
We're suing the company.

38:28.312 --> 38:30.858
She is something, this Patty, yes.

38:31.326 --> 38:32.853
Tough as nails.

38:33.101 --> 38:35.353
But very nice lady
once you know her.

38:35.716 --> 38:37.766
Well, she seems like a real doll.

38:40.229 --> 38:41.399
Let's go.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.291
Here you go.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.224
We're going back to the office.

38:49.419 --> 38:50.921
I'll be home in a bit.

38:59.441 --> 39:00.462
No smoking.

39:00.878 --> 39:01.578
Pete.

39:20.109 --> 39:20.935
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

39:20.977 --> 39:23.094
<i>You poke it, you stab it,
you jab it, you give the...</i>

39:23.136 --> 39:24.392
<i>Oh, my goodness gracious.</i>

39:24.434 --> 39:26.776
<i>Let me take these knives and put
them where they belong, okay?</i>

39:26.818 --> 39:28.406
<i>All right. Right over here.</i>

39:31.038 --> 39:32.153
<i>Problem solved.</i>

39:32.195 --> 39:35.469
<i>So, Ron, what really great, innovative
products have you brought us here?</i>

39:35.511 --> 39:38.401
<i>Well, I've created
the greatest knife.</i>

39:38.443 --> 39:40.461
<i>A knife that will never get dull.</i>

39:40.819 --> 39:43.547
<i>We call it the Showtime
Six Star Plus Series.</i>

39:52.145 --> 39:53.301
Which one is it?

39:53.505 --> 39:54.605
Third shelf.

39:54.879 --> 39:55.879
The trunk.

40:18.674 --> 40:19.833
What's the combination?

40:22.018 --> 40:22.983
Nine...

40:23.382 --> 40:24.082
Two...

40:24.887 --> 40:25.602
Two...

40:25.945 --> 40:26.645
Eight.

40:42.296 --> 40:43.315
Shit!
