WEBVTT

00:04.214 --> 00:07.218
Sh. I'm not supposed to be in the attic.

00:07.305 --> 00:09.271
Mom and Dad said it's off limits.

00:11.109 --> 00:12.804
And no kids allowed

00:12.829 --> 00:15.211
means it's the perfect place
to try my new invention.

00:15.247 --> 00:17.380
A virtual reality helmet!

00:17.416 --> 00:20.150
And I do not need
my siblings knowing about it,

00:20.185 --> 00:23.319
because with them around,
nothing lasts long.

00:24.903 --> 00:27.323
I had that pogo stick for three weeks.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.325
Video game, two days.

00:31.129 --> 00:32.395
Dead on arrival.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.431
This helmet may not look like much,

00:34.466 --> 00:36.266
but when I put it on...

00:38.303 --> 00:40.103
there's nowhere I can't go.

00:42.274 --> 00:44.174
Precision is everything.

00:47.312 --> 00:49.279
One false move, and my next trip

00:49.314 --> 00:51.314
will be to a virtual hospital.

00:53.452 --> 00:55.351
Who's up here?

00:55.387 --> 00:57.187
What are you doing?

01:01.526 --> 01:03.293
Uh, playing a new game called

01:03.328 --> 01:05.328
take big steps and knock things down.

01:05.363 --> 01:08.064
That's not new. We've been
playing it for years.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.265
You know you're not
supposed to be up here.

01:09.301 --> 01:12.068
- Neither are you.
- We heard noises.

01:12.104 --> 01:13.403
We thought the house had rats.

01:13.438 --> 01:15.238
To be honest, I'm
disappointed it doesn't.

01:15.273 --> 01:18.274
If you want rats,
you know where you should play?

01:18.310 --> 01:20.110
The old skunk den under the house.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.516
Lewie and Beast's baby book.

01:26.551 --> 01:29.185
Why is our baby book a shoebox?

01:29.221 --> 01:30.353
Mom and Dad were pretty burned out

01:30.388 --> 01:32.255
by the time you guys came along.

01:32.290 --> 01:34.057
Be glad you have a shoebox.

01:34.092 --> 01:35.425
All Daphne has is
a sticky note that says

01:35.460 --> 01:37.360
"take pictures of Daphne."

01:37.395 --> 01:40.130
Cool. Our birth certificates.

01:40.165 --> 01:42.532
Check it. I was born at 11:58 p.m.

01:42.567 --> 01:45.502
I was born at 12:03 a.m.

01:45.537 --> 01:47.537
Mom and Dad's names are both on here.

01:47.572 --> 01:50.306
Bummer. I'm not half dragon.

01:50.342 --> 01:52.142
Hang on.

01:52.177 --> 01:54.244
If I was born just before midnight,

01:54.279 --> 01:55.478
and you were born just after,

01:55.514 --> 01:58.214
that means we were
born on separate days.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.050
Wait, you guys have different birthdays?

02:01.086 --> 02:03.419
Mom and Dad never told us. So they lied?

02:03.455 --> 02:06.356
What else have they been lying about?

02:06.391 --> 02:08.458
If I make this face,
will it really get stuck?

02:11.062 --> 02:12.195
No!

02:12.230 --> 02:13.429
Come on.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.431
Mom and Dad owe us an explanation.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.267
They're lucky you're not half dragon,

02:17.302 --> 02:19.202
or they'd be in for quite the crisping.

02:21.239 --> 02:23.306
Guys, no, you can't tell Mom and Dad.

02:23.341 --> 02:25.375
They'll know you were up here.

02:25.410 --> 02:28.311
They'll know I was up here.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.413
Virtual reality...

02:30.448 --> 02:32.382
so much better than real reality.

03:27.239 --> 03:29.038
Guys, I promise you,
we weren't hiding anything.

03:29.074 --> 03:30.406
This is news to us, too.

03:30.442 --> 03:32.141
We never really looked
at the birth certificates,

03:32.177 --> 03:33.376
which frankly,
I'm impressed we still have.

03:33.411 --> 03:35.411
And to be fair, it was eight hours

03:35.447 --> 03:39.082
of horrible pain, followed by
eight years of craziness.

03:39.117 --> 03:40.383
What were you guys
doing in the attic anyway?

03:40.418 --> 03:42.285
You know it's off limits.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.088
I'm sorry, but this place
is drowning in Diazes.

03:45.123 --> 03:46.356
I needed some air.

03:46.391 --> 03:49.092
Besides, we were only
up there the one time.

03:49.127 --> 03:52.161
Not a lie. I've been up there a bunch,

03:52.197 --> 03:54.430
but we've only been up there one time.

03:54.466 --> 03:57.333
Let's not give them too long
to think about this.

03:57.369 --> 03:59.335
Lewie, Beast, different birthdays.

03:59.371 --> 04:02.338
Let's move on to a more
exciting topic, like groceries.

04:02.374 --> 04:05.141
Who wants to finish
unloading the car? I do!

04:05.176 --> 04:08.311
For our whole lives, we've had
our party on my birthday.

04:08.346 --> 04:10.346
That doesn't seem fair to Beast.

04:10.382 --> 04:12.148
Thanks, almost twin.

04:12.183 --> 04:15.385
Okay, this year, when you turn nine,

04:15.420 --> 04:17.487
you'll each get your own party.

04:17.522 --> 04:19.289
And there goes the only benefit

04:19.324 --> 04:21.089
of having two kids at once.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.159
We'll do Lewie's party on the 20th,

04:23.194 --> 04:24.360
and Beast's on the 21st.

04:24.396 --> 04:26.195
Yes, got the dates right!

04:26.231 --> 04:28.364
We're really sorry, guys.
We can't change the past,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.333
but we can fix it in the future.

04:30.368 --> 04:32.335
And since your birthday's
not for a while,

04:32.370 --> 04:34.370
take this as an early present.

04:34.406 --> 04:37.140
We know you're buying our love.

04:37.175 --> 04:38.274
And it's working.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.177
Yes!

04:41.212 --> 04:43.212
That was close.

04:43.248 --> 04:45.214
Just another example of
why whipped cream

04:45.250 --> 04:47.350
is one of nature's super foods.

04:47.385 --> 04:49.485
Now, if you'll excuse me.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:00.098 --> 05:03.099
That's good. Eight years
of missed birthdays,

05:03.134 --> 05:05.034
and you're happy with
a can of whipped cream.

05:05.070 --> 05:07.370
You're handling this
better than I would.

05:07.405 --> 05:11.040
- Especially you, Beast.
- Why?

05:11.076 --> 05:12.408
Go on.

05:15.146 --> 05:16.446
Why can't I focus?

05:16.481 --> 05:19.248
If A equals B, and B equals C,

05:19.284 --> 05:22.085
then C equals...

05:22.120 --> 05:24.354
...me blowing the SAT
for the third time.

05:24.389 --> 05:26.289
You can do this.
Think about the problem,

05:26.324 --> 05:29.092
not the picture of Liam
Hemsworth on your phone.

05:29.127 --> 05:31.094
I can't help it. He has surf hair.

05:31.129 --> 05:33.129
It's been 17 days
since he had surf hair.

05:33.164 --> 05:36.499
He was wearing red board shorts

05:36.534 --> 05:39.068
and three rope bracelets on Bondi Beach.

05:39.104 --> 05:41.270
Okay, so retaining
information, not a problem.

05:41.306 --> 05:43.206
I know, right?

05:43.241 --> 05:45.308
It's like I know the answers,
but when I'm taking the test,

05:45.343 --> 05:47.176
there's all these cute boys
I've never seen before,

05:47.212 --> 05:49.212
and I can't concen...

05:49.247 --> 05:51.114
Oh, Tatum alert.

05:51.149 --> 05:52.415
And this time, he's rocking glasses.

05:52.450 --> 05:54.417
I like smart Channing.

05:54.452 --> 05:57.053
On the other hand, higher
education isn't for everyone.

05:57.088 --> 05:59.222
No, I have to do well on
this test to get into college.

05:59.257 --> 06:01.190
I need out of here.

06:01.226 --> 06:03.426
I can't live with you people anymore.
No offense.

06:03.461 --> 06:06.129
I'm not offended, 'cause I'm
taking over your side of the room.

06:06.164 --> 06:08.131
Oh, calm down.
It's a corner, not a side.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.233
Look, we're taking
the test together this time.

06:10.268 --> 06:12.235
And now you can benefit
from the incredible focus

06:12.270 --> 06:14.070
I've learned in sports.

06:14.105 --> 06:15.471
It hasn't helped me score,
but it did win me

06:15.507 --> 06:17.206
every staring contest I had on the bus.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.078
You wanna look at surf hair, or live
with Mom and Dad until you're 90?

06:24.115 --> 06:26.149
Don't give this back to me,
no matter how much I beg.

06:26.184 --> 06:27.350
Mm-hmm.

06:27.385 --> 06:29.352
Ooh.

06:42.534 --> 06:44.434
You can't just tap someone
on the shoulder

06:44.469 --> 06:46.102
like a normal person?

06:46.137 --> 06:48.337
Taps don't make people fall.

06:48.373 --> 06:50.239
We have to talk about
a very important birthday.

06:50.275 --> 06:52.475
And by the way, what is that?

06:55.480 --> 06:58.414
This is what I'm wearing
for the SAT tomorrow.

06:58.450 --> 07:02.085
- How do I look?
- Great. Now go change.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.353
You need to wear an outfit you
wouldn't want to talk to guys in.

07:04.389 --> 07:06.355
I tried. This is me dressing down.

07:06.391 --> 07:08.057
You need to dress downer.

07:08.093 --> 07:11.027
I'm sorry, but I don't own
any horrible clothes.

07:11.062 --> 07:13.229
Ooh, I'll need something
from your closet.

07:13.264 --> 07:17.100
What? You want my fashion advice?

07:17.135 --> 07:19.368
Sure. You pick out bad outfits
for yourself every day.

07:19.404 --> 07:21.337
Thanks.

07:21.372 --> 07:24.006
See, in my head, that was a compliment.

07:24.042 --> 07:26.008
Positive thinking.
That's our next lesson.

07:27.112 --> 07:28.444
What do you guys want?

07:28.480 --> 07:31.447
Beast's half birthday is this Sunday.
He needs a party.

07:31.483 --> 07:34.250
Mom and Dad are not going to
throw a half birthday party.

07:34.285 --> 07:38.287
- I know, but you will.
- Why?

07:38.323 --> 07:41.057
Because if you don't, we'll tell
Mom and Dad about this spot,

07:41.092 --> 07:43.192
and all the other kids will know about

07:43.228 --> 07:44.360
your virtual reality helmet.

07:44.395 --> 07:46.129
Nice things don't do well here.

07:50.235 --> 07:51.334
Oh, come on.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.022
This thing is awesome.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.524
It's not even on.

08:00.558 --> 08:02.525
An hour ago, you guys were fine.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.694
Now you want me to throw you a party?

08:04.729 --> 08:05.728
What happened?

08:05.763 --> 08:07.463
We talked to Ethan.

08:09.734 --> 08:11.400
So you sold me out.

08:11.436 --> 08:13.569
No, all I said was...

08:13.605 --> 08:15.671
Eight years of missed birthdays,

08:15.707 --> 08:18.474
and you're happy with
a can of whipped cream.

08:18.510 --> 08:20.476
That's not the way I remember it.

08:20.512 --> 08:23.279
Eight years of missed birthdays,

08:23.314 --> 08:25.448
and you're happy with
a can of whipped cream?!

08:27.519 --> 08:29.318
No, I just said...

08:29.354 --> 08:30.653
You always had the party
on Lewie's birthday.

08:30.688 --> 08:34.323
Technically, Beast has never
even had a birthday party.

08:34.359 --> 08:36.325
You did not. You said...

08:36.361 --> 08:38.561
Beast has never had a birthday party

08:38.596 --> 08:40.763
in his entire life!!

08:42.534 --> 08:44.600
Wait, wait, all I said was...

08:44.636 --> 08:46.569
I really admire your patience,

08:46.604 --> 08:48.704
waiting six months for that party.

08:48.740 --> 08:51.574
I'm gonna get a sandwich.

08:51.609 --> 08:53.609
No, it was more like...

08:53.645 --> 08:56.579
This family has
always been out to get you.

08:56.614 --> 08:58.481
You've been robbed!

08:58.516 --> 09:00.583
Robbed, I say!

09:00.618 --> 09:03.553
Beast needs a party now!

09:03.588 --> 09:06.589
I'm gonna get a sandwich.

09:10.528 --> 09:12.662
Oh, so it's the sandwich part
you get right.

09:12.697 --> 09:16.265
However it went down,
you opened your big mouth.

09:16.301 --> 09:18.501
So now you're on
the party planning train.

09:18.536 --> 09:20.736
We look forward to hearing your plans.

09:20.772 --> 09:23.339
And no trains. Been there, done that.

09:40.758 --> 09:45.328
Wow. A boy hasn't looked
at me once in this outfit.

09:45.363 --> 09:47.363
This is a real insight into your world.

09:47.398 --> 09:51.367
You are really testing
this positive thinking thing.

10:04.649 --> 10:06.616
"Hey, purple top, you're cute."

10:10.722 --> 10:12.488
And begin.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.659
Rachel. Rachel!

10:16.694 --> 10:18.461
Sh. I'm in the zone.

10:23.601 --> 10:27.503
We have cotton candy, a hot dog
cart with all the fixin's,

10:27.538 --> 10:30.373
- and a clown.
- And don't worry, I asked.

10:30.408 --> 10:31.674
You can slap him with a fish.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.376
You guys get me.

10:33.411 --> 10:35.511
They get you?

10:35.546 --> 10:38.381
With all due respect,
Beast, I think not.

10:38.416 --> 10:40.483
This boy...

10:40.518 --> 10:42.451
this sweet, innocent boy,

10:42.487 --> 10:43.719
has been wronged.

10:43.755 --> 10:45.821
He has been denied his right to eight,

10:45.857 --> 10:48.457
count them, eight birthday parties,

10:48.493 --> 10:50.593
and you think tubed meat

10:50.628 --> 10:52.695
and a guy in comically large shoes

10:52.730 --> 10:54.764
will remedy this injustice?

10:54.799 --> 10:57.600
Shame on you.

10:57.635 --> 11:00.469
Shame on this entire family.

11:03.408 --> 11:04.640
You get my point.

11:05.677 --> 11:08.377
That is good poster board.

11:08.413 --> 11:10.579
I have made a list of demands
to make this man whole again.

11:13.451 --> 11:15.518
Dancing monkeys? Are you kidding me?

11:15.553 --> 11:18.387
Beast, you said you were fine
with hot dogs and a clown.

11:18.423 --> 11:19.789
That was before.

11:19.824 --> 11:21.590
I want whatever Lewie says I want.

11:23.528 --> 11:25.594
Deliver on this, or you know what.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.530
I want to go virtual shopping in France.

11:27.565 --> 11:29.665
I want to do the Tour de France.

11:31.803 --> 11:33.502
What are you doing up here?

11:33.538 --> 11:36.372
Don't get mad at us;
this is Harley's secret spot.

11:37.575 --> 11:39.542
Harley!!

11:39.577 --> 11:41.711
I look forward to hearing from you.

11:41.746 --> 11:44.346
We will now take our leave
to watch Man vs. Dumpster.

11:44.382 --> 11:46.582
Dumpster Jack will be drinking the juice

11:46.617 --> 11:49.385
from the bottom of a trash bag.

11:52.423 --> 11:53.656
Beast would've been fine
with our party plans.

11:53.691 --> 11:55.624
Lewie's the problem.

11:55.660 --> 11:57.493
We've gotta get him out of Beast's ear.

11:57.528 --> 11:59.428
Look at this.

11:59.464 --> 12:02.431
Somebody who can't spell
submarine shouldn't ask for one.

12:09.373 --> 12:10.439
Pencils down.

12:20.618 --> 12:23.385
They say love is all you need.

12:23.421 --> 12:24.687
I'm really hoping that's true.

12:28.426 --> 12:30.359
Rachel, the craziest thing happened.

12:30.394 --> 12:32.361
I know. I totally focused.

12:32.396 --> 12:34.730
I did what you told me to,
and the whole class fell away.

12:34.766 --> 12:36.565
No. Look.

12:36.601 --> 12:38.367
Right before the test started,

12:38.402 --> 12:39.568
a boy threw me this note.

12:39.604 --> 12:41.804
And after that, I couldn't concentrate.

12:41.839 --> 12:43.539
During the math section,
all I could think about

12:43.574 --> 12:45.474
is what angle the note came from.

12:45.510 --> 12:48.778
There were two boys sitting at
a perfect isosceles triangle...

12:48.813 --> 12:50.546
- two sides of equal length.
- Yes, nailed that one.

12:50.581 --> 12:52.481
This is perfect.

12:52.517 --> 12:53.749
The first boy who ever liked me,

12:53.785 --> 12:55.751
and I'm never going to know his name.

12:55.787 --> 12:58.554
Calm down.
We're playing in my court now.

12:58.589 --> 13:01.290
I'll find out who wrote that note.
Positive thinking, right?

13:01.325 --> 13:03.459
You have really turned a corner.

13:03.494 --> 13:04.727
Hmm.

13:12.804 --> 13:15.538
What a coincidence finding you in here.

13:15.573 --> 13:18.474
Alone. In your room.

13:18.509 --> 13:21.577
Since I'm here, what kind of
frosting do you want on your cake?

13:21.612 --> 13:23.312
Chocolate or vanilla?

13:23.347 --> 13:24.513
I like both,

13:24.549 --> 13:26.649
but let's see what Lewie thinks.

13:26.684 --> 13:28.450
He's in the bathroom. He'll be back

13:28.486 --> 13:30.519
in either one or eight minutes.

13:30.555 --> 13:33.389
You know, that's funny.

13:33.424 --> 13:35.758
It seems like Lewie's making
all the decisions for you.

13:35.793 --> 13:38.494
And not just about the party.

13:38.529 --> 13:40.496
Makes you wonder.

13:40.531 --> 13:43.666
If you don't stop this
now, will it ever end?

13:47.505 --> 13:50.439
We could have pudding or fruit cups.

13:50.474 --> 13:51.740
Pudding.

13:51.776 --> 13:55.477
You'll be up all night.
Have a fruit cup.

14:00.451 --> 14:03.419
When I grow up,
no one is going to tell me

14:03.454 --> 14:05.387
how much pudding I can eat.

14:05.423 --> 14:07.423
I don't know what that means,
but I agree.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.725
Time for you to start
making decisions for yourself.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.761
- Yeah.
- So, what do you want at your party?

14:12.797 --> 14:14.597
Um...

14:14.632 --> 14:16.398
Give me a minute.

14:16.434 --> 14:18.334
I'm not used to doing this.

14:20.438 --> 14:22.338
Happy Beast Day is a go!

14:25.576 --> 14:27.776
Yep, just the right amount of cling.

14:27.812 --> 14:30.779
Gotta say, great party.

14:30.815 --> 14:32.748
I'm not sure why you're doing it.

14:32.783 --> 14:34.750
Don't really wanna know, because
then I might have to do something,

14:34.785 --> 14:36.752
and right now, I'm having a good day.

14:36.787 --> 14:38.454
I think that's a smart choice.

14:38.489 --> 14:39.788
How did you pay for all this?

14:39.824 --> 14:42.391
I told abuela we're
celebrating half birthdays now.

14:42.426 --> 14:44.760
Lucky for us,
she's on a hot bingo streak.

14:44.795 --> 14:46.795
Well, what you did was so nice,

14:46.831 --> 14:49.765
we're gonna do something nice for you.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.800
We know you've been looking
for a little quiet space.

14:51.836 --> 14:53.736
Don't tell the kids.

14:53.771 --> 14:55.704
We're giving you permission
to use the attic.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.539
I thought it wasn't safe.

14:57.575 --> 14:59.742
Yeah, that was mostly
about us not wanting

14:59.777 --> 15:02.578
- to climb more steps to yell at people.
- Speaking of safety,

15:02.613 --> 15:03.746
we should grab hot dogs
before the fixin's

15:03.781 --> 15:06.515
get touched by about 50 kids.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.618
My first party. This is amazing.

15:09.654 --> 15:11.353
Happy Beast Day, Beast.

15:11.389 --> 15:12.721
The hot dog cart is fired up,

15:12.757 --> 15:14.290
and the clown will be here soon.

15:14.325 --> 15:15.524
How many fish slaps?

15:15.559 --> 15:17.426
I talked him up to three.

15:17.461 --> 15:19.361
- But nothing frozen.
- I can work with that.

15:19.397 --> 15:21.563
Hot dogs and a clown?!

15:21.599 --> 15:23.465
What are we, animals?

15:23.501 --> 15:25.367
What happened to
the things we decided on?

15:25.403 --> 15:27.703
It's my party. Why should
you pick everything?

15:27.738 --> 15:29.772
'Cause I make the best decisions.

15:29.807 --> 15:31.473
Well, I don't think so.

15:31.509 --> 15:33.409
See, that's a bad decision.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.544
Who wants to stick on a wall?

15:35.579 --> 15:36.679
You don't always know better than me.

15:36.714 --> 15:39.448
You make me have fruit cup

15:39.483 --> 15:40.783
when you know I want pudding.

15:40.818 --> 15:42.551
What are you talking about?

15:42.586 --> 15:45.387
Harley told me I should
start making my own decisions.

15:45.423 --> 15:46.622
And she was right.

15:46.657 --> 15:50.326
Oh. Harley told you.

15:51.362 --> 15:52.661
That's not what I said.

15:52.697 --> 15:55.731
Maybe it's time you start
making decisions for yourself.

15:57.435 --> 15:59.735
Yeah, that one's hard to spin.

15:59.770 --> 16:01.437
If Lewie tattles to Mom and Dad,

16:01.472 --> 16:03.372
I'll lose the hideout I just got.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.117
Oh, yes!

16:17.153 --> 16:18.486
- Ethan.
- Hey.

16:18.521 --> 16:21.388
How can you be enjoying
yourself at a time like this?

16:21.424 --> 16:23.090
I thought it was a party.

16:25.194 --> 16:27.428
I have to find Lewie before
he talks to Mom and Dad.

16:27.463 --> 16:30.097
So what do you want me to do?

16:30.133 --> 16:32.433
Beast is used to having
Lewie to do stuff with.

16:32.468 --> 16:34.235
Cover for me until I can get him back.

16:34.270 --> 16:37.371
And I couldn't have done that
with cotton candy in my hand?

16:38.407 --> 16:40.274
Lewie, I'm begging you.

16:40.309 --> 16:42.510
- Please don't tell Mom and Dad.
- Why shouldn't I?

16:42.545 --> 16:46.280
Look, I'm sorry I got
in between you and Beast.

16:46.315 --> 16:47.548
But I had to do something.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.117
You gave me an impossible list.

16:50.153 --> 16:52.153
I mean, abuela didn't make
enough at bingo

16:52.188 --> 16:53.420
to pay for a submarine,

16:53.456 --> 16:55.356
which, by the way,
has an "e" at the end.

16:55.391 --> 16:59.093
Nice talking to you. Mom!

16:59.128 --> 17:02.396
Wait. Wasn't the whole point
of this for Beast to have fun?

17:02.431 --> 17:05.332
He's having the time
of his life out there.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.401
You gotta give him credit.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.170
He planned a really good party.

17:09.204 --> 17:10.337
But he did it all without me.

17:10.373 --> 17:13.174
Yeah, and everything turned out great.

17:13.209 --> 17:16.143
You're right. It did.

17:16.179 --> 17:19.512
I guess Beast doesn't need me anymore.

17:22.218 --> 17:24.251
Listen, I'm sorry I wasn't
able to find that boy.

17:24.287 --> 17:26.086
Oh, no biggie.

17:26.122 --> 17:28.289
I can't believe I messed up
on an important test

17:28.324 --> 17:30.191
because of a boy. I learned my lesson.

17:30.226 --> 17:31.258
I am done chasing guys.

17:31.294 --> 17:34.228
That's too bad, because I was gonna say

17:34.263 --> 17:36.263
I'm sorry that I didn't
find him right away,

17:36.299 --> 17:39.099
but I did find him, and he's
coming to Beast's party.

17:39.135 --> 17:41.468
What?! Who? When?

17:41.504 --> 17:43.304
I thought you were done chasing guys.

17:43.339 --> 17:46.173
Oh, don't tell me what I said.
How did you do it?

17:54.250 --> 17:56.250
When you dress that badly,
you're basically invisible.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.186
I got the names of
all the guys who took the test,

17:59.222 --> 18:00.287
and invited them to Beast's party.

18:00.323 --> 18:03.490
Wait, wait, but if they all show up,
how will we know who wrote the note?

18:03.526 --> 18:07.027
It's a party for a kid
turning eight and a half.

18:07.063 --> 18:09.063
Whoever shows up
is the one who wrote it.

18:09.098 --> 18:10.231
Hm.

18:10.266 --> 18:12.266
What is all this?

18:12.301 --> 18:14.034
Pie-eating contest.

18:14.070 --> 18:16.215
First team to eat five wins.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.442
No hands.

18:18.467 --> 18:20.634
- We got this.
- We do?

18:22.704 --> 18:24.471
Harley!

18:24.506 --> 18:26.573
Whoo hoo!

18:26.608 --> 18:27.807
Awesome stick.

18:27.843 --> 18:30.777
We really should've done this
before the pies.

18:30.812 --> 18:32.779
Harley.

18:34.783 --> 18:37.417
We're doing the three-legged race next.

18:37.452 --> 18:40.353
That doesn't sound so bad.

18:40.389 --> 18:41.588
It's great.

18:41.623 --> 18:44.457
We put mud pies down our pants first.

18:44.493 --> 18:45.692
Start stretching, partner.

18:49.398 --> 18:51.598
Finally. Please tell me
Lewie is coming back.

18:51.633 --> 18:52.799
Or ratted you out.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.634
I don't care at this point.

18:54.670 --> 18:56.603
Okay, everybody, gather round.

18:56.638 --> 18:59.539
Come on, come on,
bring it in, bring it in.

18:59.575 --> 19:01.575
Okay, come on. Bring it in.

19:01.610 --> 19:03.577
We have a surprise guest.

19:06.348 --> 19:08.381
Someone having a half birthday?

19:11.453 --> 19:12.786
Dumpster Jack!

19:12.821 --> 19:15.555
Here, in my dumpster?!

19:15.591 --> 19:16.690
You must be Beast.

19:19.528 --> 19:22.395
I heard you and your brother
are my biggest fans.

19:22.431 --> 19:24.364
He called me and said
you deserved to have

19:24.399 --> 19:25.632
the best birthday ever.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.634
Lewie said that?

19:27.669 --> 19:31.338
Yep. Now which one is he?

19:31.373 --> 19:33.673
He's... he's not here.

19:33.709 --> 19:35.508
That's too bad.

19:35.544 --> 19:38.478
'Cause I brought you guys something.

19:42.517 --> 19:44.651
Just so you know,

19:44.686 --> 19:46.653
I absolutely cannot fit in those.

19:46.688 --> 19:49.623
All right, kids, who wants to see me

19:49.658 --> 19:52.459
chug spoiled eggnog?

20:03.405 --> 20:05.372
What do you mean, don't come in?

20:08.777 --> 20:11.378
I'd like to be alone with my thoughts.

20:11.413 --> 20:13.813
You sure? 'Cause the party's pretty fun.

20:13.849 --> 20:16.583
Yeah. I know. It turned out great,

20:16.618 --> 20:19.519
and I had nothing to do with it.

20:19.554 --> 20:21.788
I guess you don't need
me around anymore.

20:21.823 --> 20:24.557
I wouldn't say that.

20:24.593 --> 20:27.494
Because without you, how
would Dumpster Jack be here?

20:27.529 --> 20:28.862
What?!

20:29.898 --> 20:31.698
Dumpster Jack came?

20:31.733 --> 20:33.600
Yep. He brought us these.

20:37.806 --> 20:39.572
Wow!

20:39.608 --> 20:41.508
I can't believe you got him
to come to my party.

20:41.543 --> 20:42.742
How did you do it?

20:42.778 --> 20:44.611
You know how he has that tip line.

20:44.646 --> 20:47.480
"If there's a disgusting
trash bin making you wanna hurl,

20:47.516 --> 20:48.848
call me now"

20:48.884 --> 20:51.685
I called 73 times.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.453
Seventy-two were about your party.

20:53.488 --> 20:54.788
One was about our trash bin.

20:54.823 --> 20:57.557
I threw a good party,
but you made it great.

20:59.695 --> 21:01.494
We may have different birthdays,

21:01.530 --> 21:03.496
but we're still better together.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.500
I'd tell you how much
this all means to me,

21:07.536 --> 21:09.836
but I don't wanna get
emotional in front of Santa.

21:15.811 --> 21:18.778
Mystery boy's not here yet.
I wonder if he'll come.

21:18.814 --> 21:21.748
We've got a Velcro wall
and a guy in a dumpster.

21:21.783 --> 21:24.551
I'd be more worried if he'll stay.

21:24.586 --> 21:25.685
Is that him?

21:27.689 --> 21:31.491
Yes. He was seated at
the hypotenuse of the triangle.

21:32.794 --> 21:34.728
Thank you for doing this.

21:34.763 --> 21:36.396
You helped me with the test.

21:36.431 --> 21:37.864
It's the least I could do.

21:37.899 --> 21:39.632
It's also the most I was going to do.

21:41.570 --> 21:43.503
Hi. I'm Wyatt.

21:43.538 --> 21:45.572
I'm Georgie. I got your hair note.

21:45.607 --> 21:48.708
Oh, I'm glad. I was aiming
for your desk, but missed.

21:50.445 --> 21:52.612
I thought it might be
weeks before you found it.

21:53.815 --> 21:55.749
You're just lucky it wasn't a humid day.

22:05.527 --> 22:06.793
Glad you made it, Lewie.

22:06.828 --> 22:10.530
He said my name. I think I may pass out.

22:10.565 --> 22:12.399
Speaking of passing out,

22:12.434 --> 22:14.567
will you drink some more
of that spoiled eggnog?

22:14.603 --> 22:16.636
I really shouldn't.

22:16.671 --> 22:18.371
But I will!

22:18.407 --> 22:19.572
Yeah!!

22:24.746 --> 22:26.713
Well, it all worked out.

22:26.748 --> 22:29.649
The boys are back together,
and my attic space is safe.

22:29.684 --> 22:31.818
And my VR helmet is mine alone.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.853
Hey, so we went up to the attic

22:33.889 --> 22:36.423
to clear some space for you.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.658
I'm halfway up the ice wall.

22:38.693 --> 22:40.393
I'll tell you where it ends.

22:40.429 --> 22:41.694
Punishment Peak.

22:42.507 --> 22:47.507
