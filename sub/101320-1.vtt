WEBVTT

00:39.804 --> 00:41.941
You boys

00:41.974 --> 00:43.709
have dishonored our nation.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.615
and betrayed your oath to protect
the people of this country.

00:51.984 --> 00:54.219
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

01:44.336 --> 01:47.340
Men of the 24th Infantry,

01:47.372 --> 01:48.774
this is Texas.

01:49.875 --> 01:52.944
And we have
a great opportunity here.

01:52.978 --> 01:56.881
While we're overseeing
the building of Camp Logan,

01:56.914 --> 02:00.419
we will also be building
our legacy,

02:00.452 --> 02:03.822
a legacy, if proven worthy,

02:03.856 --> 02:07.627
that will carry us all the way
to the shores of France.

02:09.428 --> 02:10.763
Let's go! Let's go!

02:10.794 --> 02:12.597
First Sergeant Hayes,

02:12.631 --> 02:14.767
take command.

02:14.799 --> 02:16.501
Sir.

02:19.771 --> 02:21.807
Home sweet home, boys.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.877
Order, arms!

02:28.347 --> 02:29.949
Fall out!

02:39.390 --> 02:40.959
You gonna
get a taste, boy.

02:40.993 --> 02:43.061
I talked to the cleaner,

02:43.095 --> 02:44.896
the Colonel said
we're going to France.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.432
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:46.465 --> 02:47.566
- Yeah, we're going to France.
- Uh-huh.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.401
Yeah, while we're out here
digging the shitting hole.

02:49.435 --> 02:50.735
That's the 24th honor.

02:50.769 --> 02:51.970
We fly to Philippines
but not France.

02:52.003 --> 02:56.508
Well, this is the war to make
the world a safer democracy.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.477
And we're not
part of that democracy.

02:58.509 --> 03:00.679
How you talk like that?
You talk better than white folks.

03:00.712 --> 03:02.982
He's a fancy talking nigger.
Didn't you know that?

03:03.014 --> 03:04.616
Yeah, he's a joker.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.886
And he has
already been to France.

03:06.918 --> 03:09.554
- Now, hold on now, you've been to France?
- Yes, sir. That's right.

03:09.587 --> 03:10.823
You better tell me about that.

03:10.856 --> 03:12.892
- What do you wanna know?
- Then why'd you join the army, boy?

03:14.827 --> 03:17.830
- Same reason as you, friend.
- Oh, hell no.

03:17.863 --> 03:19.098
See I joined
'cause the judge said

03:19.131 --> 03:21.800
I go to the army
or I go to jail.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.669
I had no choice.

03:23.702 --> 03:25.871
But you're so goddamn smart.

03:25.904 --> 03:27.940
What in the shit
is you doing here?

03:27.972 --> 03:30.108
Oh, he's smart, Walker,
he know the fancy words.

03:30.142 --> 03:32.578
You shut 'em
tunnel lips, pickaninny,

03:32.610 --> 03:35.047
before I come over there
and shut 'em.

03:35.079 --> 03:36.348
I'm no better than you.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.551
But in here, you think you is.

03:38.584 --> 03:41.787
- Now, hold on now, Walker.
- I want to serve my country

03:41.819 --> 03:43.756
and raise the image
of the colored man.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.491
You can't
raise me nowhere, boy.

03:46.525 --> 03:47.693
I've got this raisin'.

03:47.726 --> 03:51.030
- Hey! Hey!
- You put that down, you put that down now.

03:51.062 --> 03:52.631
Damn it, Walker, leave him be.

03:52.663 --> 03:54.833
I'm just messing with him.

03:54.866 --> 03:56.935
If I wanted to use it,
I'd have slashed your face already, boy.

03:56.968 --> 03:58.370
Come on then.

03:59.071 --> 04:01.941
I'm just messin' with you, boy.

04:01.973 --> 04:05.009
Getting friendly with you
'cause I don't know you.

04:05.043 --> 04:06.479
Getting familiar.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.985
What's your name?

04:13.018 --> 04:15.554
- Boston.
- Walker.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.723
Mulatto bastard.

04:18.189 --> 04:19.757
Attention!

04:19.791 --> 04:21.125
Hey!

04:22.561 --> 04:24.063
Get out that hole.

04:28.967 --> 04:32.705
Get your asses cleaned up.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.044
Curfew!

04:39.076 --> 04:40.512
Sorry, Captain.

04:42.147 --> 04:45.050
- What happened to your eye?
- Had an accident, Captain.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.585
Mmm-hmm.

05:01.799 --> 05:04.169
- Get your black ass back inside, soldier.
- Yes, Captain.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.850
You can walk down
the <i>Champs-Elysees</i>

05:17.883 --> 05:20.051
hand in hand with whoever.

05:20.085 --> 05:21.620
Everybody's equal there.

05:21.652 --> 05:22.989
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

05:24.989 --> 05:26.725
You ever get with
one of them French white gals?

05:29.494 --> 05:31.729
White and colored, both.

05:34.099 --> 05:35.634
- Come on!
- Mmm-hmm.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.236
Boston, you something.

05:37.268 --> 05:38.937
You know,
but why didn't you stay there?

05:38.970 --> 05:41.506
It's not home.

05:42.674 --> 05:45.077
Do you talk that Frenchie?

05:45.109 --> 05:46.679
I know you know something.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.151
Oh, what's that?

05:53.184 --> 05:58.056
It means, "There's no love
like the love of a brother."

05:58.957 --> 06:00.493
Hmm. I like that.

06:00.525 --> 06:01.693
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:01.727 --> 06:02.794
- All right.
- I'm learning.

06:02.828 --> 06:04.729
...a move
for the brothers, right?

06:04.763 --> 06:05.965
- Say it again.
- Close.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.199
Yes, I got it.

06:09.835 --> 06:11.704
You think
you're getting to know him.

06:21.813 --> 06:24.650
Look like you needed a drink
with that sandwich, boy.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.119
Just be glad
I didn't shit on him.

06:41.633 --> 06:42.935
Is someone there?

06:57.215 --> 06:58.883
Oh, you wanna get your head cut.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.619
Oh, Lord!

07:00.652 --> 07:02.054
Oh, you scared?

07:02.087 --> 07:04.789
You look like
you've seen Medusa.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.659
Where... Where you coming from?

07:06.691 --> 07:08.793
- Oh, it's a story...
- Ah, let me tell it.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.128
Okay, go on.

07:10.162 --> 07:11.597
<i>♪ You see</i>

07:11.629 --> 07:13.932
<i>♪ We went down
to the sugar shack</i>

07:13.965 --> 07:15.266
<i>♪ And then</i>

07:15.299 --> 07:18.102
<i>♪ Me and him got kicked out</i>

07:18.136 --> 07:19.203
<i>♪ 'Cause of him</i>

07:19.237 --> 07:20.606
<i>♪ I'm able</i>

07:20.638 --> 07:21.906
<i>♪ At gun point ♪</i>

07:21.941 --> 07:24.075
- That's the whole story.
- Now, listen, now you tell it wrong.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.078
Tell him what happened.

07:26.111 --> 07:28.047
Listen, so, look.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.249
- I had me a gal, all right?
- Okay.

07:30.282 --> 07:32.051
Everything was going good,
all right?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.985
I was giving her my best move, all right.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.854
And then, all of a sudden,
she just goes down to the ground.

07:36.888 --> 07:38.257
Hey, I thought
she dropped something.

07:38.289 --> 07:41.626
All of a sudden
she puts her whole mouth

07:41.660 --> 07:44.063
- on Mr. Johnson.
- All right, now.

07:44.095 --> 07:46.164
Fucking piranha or what...

07:46.198 --> 07:47.032
Goddamn Dracula.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.234
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait...
She bit you?

07:49.266 --> 07:51.269
Yeah, I mean, almost.

07:51.302 --> 07:53.304
What else was she doing down there?
I had to push her off.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.809
Why you laughing?

07:56.842 --> 07:59.678
- I'm sorry.
- You know what? Fuck you both.

07:59.710 --> 08:01.780
I don't think
she was trying to bite you.

08:01.813 --> 08:04.250
What? Then what the hell
was she doing down there?

08:08.186 --> 08:10.756
Well, that's not gonna happen now,
you see, 'Cause you pushed her off.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.324
What?

08:12.357 --> 08:13.725
- That's right.
- Hey, let's get some...

08:13.758 --> 08:17.095
- Hold on now, I didn't know you could do that.
- Too late!

08:17.128 --> 08:19.297
No, we gotta go back,
I gotta get that.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.200
Uh-uh, let's go, bring yourself.
- No, hold on now.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.639
Three cents.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.874
Here.

08:34.211 --> 08:36.313
Oh, ain't that some shit.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.282
Ain't no seats left.

08:38.316 --> 08:40.318
Three cents.

08:40.351 --> 08:41.986
Hold that car.

08:42.019 --> 08:43.655
Hold that car.

08:46.258 --> 08:49.128
Will if it ain't
the fancy nigger.

08:49.161 --> 08:52.263
You know, I'm just now getting out that
hole Sarge put me in 'cause of you.

08:54.766 --> 08:56.202
You ain't gonna
be talking to me, boy?

08:57.902 --> 09:00.038
Oh, you fancy and deaf, huh?

09:00.071 --> 09:01.239
Three cents.

09:08.113 --> 09:09.715
Come on back here.

09:11.282 --> 09:13.185
Shit.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.155
Walker?

09:16.187 --> 09:18.723
Walker, what the hell
are you doing?

09:18.757 --> 09:20.926
What does it look like I'm doing?
Sitting in my goddamn seat.

09:20.959 --> 09:23.195
You better stand your ass up and come
on back here with the rest of us.

09:23.228 --> 09:25.263
Come on back here, boy's
room, sit on my lap, come on.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.800
- You want me to sit on your lap?
- Move behind the screen.

09:27.832 --> 09:29.131
There ain't no room, man.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.902
Get back with the others.

09:30.936 --> 09:33.739
Look, I'm a soldier here
on assignment.

09:33.772 --> 09:34.806
I'm headed back to camp.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.740
I paid my money.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.175
Now just go ahead
and drive this machine.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.113
Oh, shit.

09:41.146 --> 09:43.048
Officer Cross.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.449
- Need some help here.
- Walker...

09:44.483 --> 09:47.286
- Stop being stubborn. Come on.
- Stop worrying so much.

09:47.319 --> 09:49.689
- This one right here, Officer.
- We're trying to help you.

09:59.998 --> 10:01.267
Y'all get off.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.226
Get where you belong.

10:31.296 --> 10:34.398
I'm a soldier in the U.S. Army.

10:34.431 --> 10:35.901
I sit where I wanna sit.

10:38.235 --> 10:39.904
Shit!

10:39.937 --> 10:41.405
Sir...

10:48.479 --> 10:52.283
Don't you ever talk back
to a white man.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.356
Yo! Stop!

10:57.388 --> 10:59.224
Drop it, big buck.

10:59.257 --> 11:02.027
You mean as about
as much to me as a gnat.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.529
So get off before I swat ya.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.233
Okay, come on,
come on, Boston...

11:08.266 --> 11:10.269
Let's go, let's go, come on.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.042
Come here, boy.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.278
You're a soldier, huh?

11:23.514 --> 11:26.885
You ain't nothing
but a nagger in a fancy getup.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.543
Jim Crow's the law.

11:51.575 --> 11:52.912
Respect it.

11:54.446 --> 11:56.315
Sorry for the trouble, folks.

12:12.196 --> 12:14.298
Private William Boston,

12:14.331 --> 12:17.034
you have
an impressive background.

12:17.067 --> 12:20.905
It's says here in your file you
recently graduated from the Sorbonne

12:20.939 --> 12:22.875
- in Paris, France.
- Yes, sir.

12:22.907 --> 12:24.210
It's a fine school.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.246
I'd like to recommend you

12:28.279 --> 12:32.149
for Colored Officer Training
School in Des Moines, Iowa.

12:32.182 --> 12:35.354
I think with your credentials
you'll do very well there.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.055
- No, sir.
- No?

12:37.088 --> 12:38.657
Why, Private?

12:38.690 --> 12:40.392
Well, sir,

12:40.425 --> 12:43.195
I joined the army
to be of service to my country

12:43.228 --> 12:44.596
and my race.

12:44.628 --> 12:46.999
Your only allegiance
is to your country, Private.

12:47.532 --> 12:48.966
Of course, sir.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.134
However, sir, my intent

12:50.167 --> 12:53.104
is to constructive with the
other men of color, sir.

12:53.138 --> 12:55.407
Well, that's a lot
of hard work, Private.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.676
Officers are excused
from that kind of manual labor.

12:58.710 --> 13:02.013
Is that what
drove your commission, Captain,

13:02.047 --> 13:03.581
escaping manual labor?

13:05.249 --> 13:08.253
I admire service over ambition.

13:08.286 --> 13:11.223
So, we'll leave it at that.

13:14.392 --> 13:19.330
You were with Private Walker
last night.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.166
Yes, sir.

13:21.199 --> 13:23.902
Why did Private Walker
violate the racial code?

13:26.104 --> 13:29.240
Because he's a soldier
in the U.S. Military, sir.

13:29.273 --> 13:30.676
They violated his right
as an American.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.712
Private, he's a negro
in Houston, Texas.

13:33.744 --> 13:35.413
He has no rights.

13:38.450 --> 13:42.688
Things are a little different
down here in the South,

13:42.720 --> 13:45.691
Boston.

13:45.724 --> 13:49.427
From now on, I'll expect you
men to obey the racial code.

13:49.460 --> 13:51.529
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.431
You're dismissed.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.189
Hey!

14:19.391 --> 14:20.726
Get away from that water, boy.

14:21.192 --> 14:23.127
It's our water.

14:24.662 --> 14:26.064
My apologies.

14:26.096 --> 14:28.699
There's no sign.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.502
Drink your own kind's water.

14:31.569 --> 14:33.572
But where's my kind's water?

14:37.808 --> 14:38.743
You sassin' me, boy?

14:38.777 --> 14:40.746
- Don't put your hands on me.
- Do what now?

14:40.778 --> 14:42.681
Don't put your hands on me.

14:43.681 --> 14:45.316
Clean your plough, boy.

14:47.685 --> 14:51.256
Only somebody you gonna
be pissing on today, boy,

14:51.288 --> 14:52.523
is yourself.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.399
We got guns too.

15:04.402 --> 15:06.372
Next time it ain't going to
spit, it's going to be blood.

15:08.239 --> 15:11.744
You ain't gonna be wiping it off
'cause you'll be dead...

15:12.744 --> 15:14.213
Nigger.

15:15.613 --> 15:16.749
You too.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.218
At ease.

15:21.252 --> 15:22.521
Let's go, boys.

15:50.681 --> 15:52.350
All right, Boston.

15:55.152 --> 15:56.687
- Evening, Sergeants.
- Evening, Boston.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.758
- Enjoying yourself, Private?
- Oh, yes, sir, First Sergeant.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.527
Someone did
a great thing for us.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.198
You know, I've been in
the army for a long time

16:07.231 --> 16:09.700
and I knows enough to know
something about you don't add up.

16:12.537 --> 16:14.605
I don't know
what you mean, First Sergeant.

16:15.907 --> 16:18.176
This act you're putting on,

16:18.209 --> 16:20.878
walking different,
talking different.

16:20.912 --> 16:23.114
I'm not acting, First Sergeant.

16:25.182 --> 16:27.284
- Excuse me.
- I didn't dismiss you.

16:33.191 --> 16:35.293
Dismissed.

16:43.935 --> 16:45.637
Why are you so hard
on that boy?

16:47.272 --> 16:50.175
You know who he reminds me of?

16:50.207 --> 16:51.476
- Who?
- Fagen.

16:54.278 --> 16:56.213
That Black motherfucker
did desert

16:56.247 --> 16:59.551
and join the Filipino army,
fought against his own damn country and us.

16:59.584 --> 17:00.786
Yep.

17:02.186 --> 17:04.522
Why Boston remind you of him?

17:04.555 --> 17:08.259
I don't think Fagen believed
he was a nigger,

17:08.291 --> 17:09.594
just like him.

17:12.396 --> 17:13.763
Let's go play some tonk.

17:34.985 --> 17:36.321
You know any Eubie Blake?

17:43.828 --> 17:45.864
Very nice.

17:45.897 --> 17:48.633
You know, I've seen him play in
New York on numerous occasions.

17:48.666 --> 17:50.202
You've seen Eubie Blake?

17:50.234 --> 17:53.271
Yes, ma'am,
and Scott Joplin as well.

17:53.303 --> 17:54.705
What about Jimmy Earl?

17:54.738 --> 17:55.639
You know about Jimmy Earl?

17:55.674 --> 17:58.609
I listen to
Talking Machine recordings.

18:10.988 --> 18:12.456
You sound just like him.

18:13.925 --> 18:14.960
Are you playing for us tonight?

18:20.965 --> 18:22.701
Come on now, Marie.

18:27.438 --> 18:30.774
- So you're not playing for us tonight?
- No.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.445
They dropped me last minute.

18:33.477 --> 18:35.446
Said they wanted men
to play for men.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.815
Didn't want me to distract.

18:36.848 --> 18:40.719
- Then why are you here?
- To distract.

18:40.752 --> 18:42.854
So maybe
I can help you out with that?

18:42.887 --> 18:44.723
What you mean?

18:44.755 --> 18:46.890
- May I have this dance?
- Why should I?

18:46.924 --> 18:48.260
'Cause you've got
a score to settle.

19:24.962 --> 19:26.965
Looks like
you took back the night.

19:26.997 --> 19:28.632
You might be right.

20:17.482 --> 20:20.018
What happened?
Let's keep dancing.

20:21.418 --> 20:22.720
Uh, I got to get home.

20:24.921 --> 20:26.023
May I walk you?

20:45.576 --> 20:47.512
Do you like living here?

20:47.544 --> 20:50.614
Lot of folks is leaving,
thought about migration.

20:50.648 --> 20:54.151
- Why do you stay?
- My home.

20:56.521 --> 20:58.490
Ever think of going to New York?

20:59.791 --> 21:01.760
An artist like you
could make a life there.

21:01.792 --> 21:05.397
Hmm, New York City.

21:05.429 --> 21:07.664
That's so far away
from what I know,

21:07.697 --> 21:09.400
I have to believe it's there.

21:09.434 --> 21:12.070
like heaven.

21:12.102 --> 21:14.138
You got people there?

21:14.171 --> 21:16.874
- Most dead.
- Mmm.

21:16.907 --> 21:18.877
My mom passed a few years ago.

21:18.909 --> 21:21.079
My daddy just this spring.

21:21.111 --> 21:23.415
He's a preacher.

21:23.447 --> 21:26.150
- Is that where you learned the piano?
- Yes.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.620
My daddy and I, we fell out.

21:29.654 --> 21:30.689
What happened?

21:33.224 --> 21:36.160
This is my place.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.896
Thanks for the walk.

21:39.563 --> 21:41.733
My pleasure,

21:41.765 --> 21:44.468
Miss...

21:44.502 --> 21:47.406
Marie. Downing.

21:48.705 --> 21:50.408
William Boston.

21:53.543 --> 21:54.879
Goodnight, William.

21:57.247 --> 21:58.850
Goodnight, Marie.

22:09.793 --> 22:11.662
This is chief of
police, Carter Hammond.

22:12.863 --> 22:14.865
Now, he assures me

22:14.898 --> 22:18.669
that you will have no further
problems with the Houston police.

22:18.703 --> 22:21.138
As military police
in the city of Houston,

22:21.171 --> 22:23.941
you are to ensure order

22:23.975 --> 22:26.610
of the men
of the 24th Infantry only.

22:26.644 --> 22:29.614
We'll issue nightsticks
but no side on it.

22:29.647 --> 22:32.783
Any trouble
that you might encounter,

22:32.817 --> 22:35.553
report it immediately
to your new corporal,

22:35.586 --> 22:38.022
Boston.

22:38.054 --> 22:40.725
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

22:40.757 --> 22:42.526
You can stand at ease.

22:45.596 --> 22:46.865
- Corporal.
- Corporal.

22:48.366 --> 22:51.269
Hey, you know the best thing about this?
He'll have provost duty now.

22:51.301 --> 22:52.637
What's that?

22:52.669 --> 22:55.539
We gonna be in town
every day.

22:55.572 --> 22:56.874
Gonna get me a little hand.

22:56.907 --> 22:58.642
You trace that gal of yours?

22:58.676 --> 22:59.711
Oh, yeah,
that piano-playing gal.

22:59.744 --> 23:01.812
She still got you
chasing behind that jelly roll?

23:01.846 --> 23:04.883
- Bells are ringing for me and my gal.
- Yeah.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.952
Hey, well, good luck
with them crackers.

23:08.084 --> 23:10.954
Corporal Half Falooda.

23:10.987 --> 23:14.725
You can fool everybody else
with your Houdini,

23:14.759 --> 23:17.796
but you can't fool old Sarge.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.031
Top Sergeant.

23:20.063 --> 23:21.733
Encouraging the men, sir.

23:21.765 --> 23:24.735
Being an MP ain't no walk in the
park, sir. No, sir.

23:24.769 --> 23:25.770
That's correct.

23:25.803 --> 23:28.138
I'd like a private word
with Corporal Boston.

23:29.005 --> 23:30.175
Yes, sir.

23:33.610 --> 23:34.912
Corporal, sir?

23:36.947 --> 23:38.749
You're the only man I have

23:38.782 --> 23:41.119
that understands both sides.

23:41.151 --> 23:42.719
You can make
a difference here, William.

23:44.288 --> 23:46.691
The police brutalize us, sir.

23:46.724 --> 23:48.592
We need more than night sticks.

23:48.626 --> 23:52.998
I report everything that happens
here to the War Department.

23:54.231 --> 23:56.968
What I need from you

23:57.001 --> 23:59.771
is to keep the men safe
and in order.

23:59.803 --> 24:01.805
You do that,

24:01.839 --> 24:05.243
and I will personally
protect you from any trouble.

24:05.275 --> 24:08.079
All we want, sir,

24:08.111 --> 24:11.782
is to be treated as soldiers
and as men.

24:14.150 --> 24:16.120
That is certainly
a fair request.

24:19.956 --> 24:22.159
Thank you, sir.

24:22.193 --> 24:24.362
Chief, Captain.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.766
Dead man walking.

24:40.211 --> 24:41.780
Ah!

24:44.881 --> 24:46.083
Ah!

25:00.798 --> 25:02.667
I wanna know
what your problem is.

25:07.338 --> 25:08.873
Ooh!

25:11.975 --> 25:14.878
You see this here?

25:14.911 --> 25:17.781
I got it moving up San Juan Hill

25:17.814 --> 25:20.017
alongside Teddy Roosevelt.

25:22.153 --> 25:24.889
Gave it everything we had.

25:24.921 --> 25:26.323
Courage,

25:26.357 --> 25:28.693
blood,

25:28.725 --> 25:31.195
everything.

25:31.227 --> 25:36.199
In the end, it was our
dead black bodies on the ground,

25:36.233 --> 25:37.902
and my eye...

25:39.369 --> 25:41.773
That lying son of a bitch

25:41.805 --> 25:44.174
sailed off to the White House,

25:45.042 --> 25:47.811
took our credit...

25:48.745 --> 25:50.314
We don't matter, boy.

25:52.782 --> 25:54.051
Bullshit.

25:55.186 --> 25:57.789
We do matter.

25:57.821 --> 25:59.456
We keep proving ourselves,

25:59.490 --> 26:02.359
maybe things will change.

26:02.392 --> 26:06.830
Only thing worse than a
dumb nigger is a blind one.

26:06.863 --> 26:10.167
- I didn't dismiss you yet.
- Yes, sir, First Sergeant.

26:22.012 --> 26:26.117
Everything you've seen
here so far,

26:26.149 --> 26:29.019
that's child's play.

26:29.052 --> 26:30.253
What you gonna do

26:30.286 --> 26:32.856
when the fire get hot?

26:34.058 --> 26:35.859
You're gonna run back
to your France

26:35.892 --> 26:38.429
and tell them you helped
with the negro cause?

26:40.531 --> 26:41.866
Nigger.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.970
Next time you get an itch

26:47.003 --> 26:48.371
and want to talk to me,

26:48.405 --> 26:51.442
you better look around.

26:51.475 --> 26:54.111
You got too many problems

26:54.145 --> 26:56.181
to be asking me
what my problem is.

27:00.885 --> 27:04.288
Ah, dismissed.

27:04.321 --> 27:05.990
Actor.

27:28.946 --> 27:32.149
I received a message
from my brother Ben.

27:32.183 --> 27:35.253
Apparently, our father is doing
quite poorly.

27:35.285 --> 27:37.554
Did your brother
say anything else?

27:37.588 --> 27:39.124
Just more of the same.

27:40.890 --> 27:45.162
"Wasting your career
commanding colored troops,

27:45.196 --> 27:47.031
"ruining the family legacy."

27:47.063 --> 27:49.801
You're never going to get
what you deserve

27:49.833 --> 27:52.836
as long as you work with negros.

27:52.869 --> 27:53.905
You'll retire a colonel,

27:53.937 --> 27:57.475
instead of retiring a general,
like your brother.

27:58.542 --> 28:00.244
My brother...

28:03.513 --> 28:04.815
The general,

28:06.984 --> 28:10.455
he could leverage his position
with the War Department

28:11.589 --> 28:14.392
and get the 24th over there,

28:15.225 --> 28:17.294
in the fight, in the war.

28:17.328 --> 28:19.497
He's never going to do that.

28:26.536 --> 28:28.305
Then I'll retire a colonel.

28:34.477 --> 28:36.046
Hi.

28:36.546 --> 28:37.548
William.

28:38.581 --> 28:40.350
I couldn't stop thinking
about you.

28:42.352 --> 28:44.120
- Thank you.
- May I come in.

28:44.154 --> 28:45.590
That's not a good idea.

28:45.622 --> 28:49.226
Well, can you
come out here?

28:49.260 --> 28:51.061
William, I have a guest.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.535
Corporal Fancy.
What you doing here, boy?

29:01.405 --> 29:03.975
- Is she your girl?
- What you think?

29:04.475 --> 29:06.878
Hmm? Good night.

29:11.482 --> 29:15.987
Mmm-hmm.

29:16.020 --> 29:19.056
Boy, you should have
seen your face.

29:19.089 --> 29:21.524
Can't believe you bought
that gal flowers.

29:21.558 --> 29:23.494
You know what she did?

29:23.526 --> 29:25.295
Slammed the door in your face,

29:25.329 --> 29:27.999
Then she threw 'em out.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.934
What are you talking about?

29:29.966 --> 29:31.534
Fool ass Boston.

29:31.568 --> 29:33.537
Didn't know his best gal
was my little whore.

29:33.570 --> 29:35.373
Oh, shit.

29:38.274 --> 29:40.378
Get up. Come on.

29:40.410 --> 29:42.880
- You ready now?
- Come on.

29:53.991 --> 29:55.459
Enough!

29:55.492 --> 29:57.295
Get out of my way.
Hey. Hey!

29:57.328 --> 29:59.664
Sons of bitches.
Get your black asses up!

29:59.696 --> 30:01.599
Let me tell you
something right now.

30:01.631 --> 30:05.268
Hey, I'm gonna cool
you two bucks off. Huh?

30:05.301 --> 30:07.105
You ready for that?
Come with me.

30:15.311 --> 30:17.215
Oh, shit.

30:23.219 --> 30:25.422
What's taking you
so long, Private?

30:25.455 --> 30:29.961
Sir, that's another man.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.929
You wanna be next?

30:33.263 --> 30:34.698
Tie the goddamn ropes.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.103
Welcome to my world, boy.

30:40.137 --> 30:42.540
You ain't so fancy now,
huh, Uncle Tom?

30:43.340 --> 30:44.707
Welcome to my world.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.178
- Franklin, you tie those nice and tight.
- Yeah, you tie them ropes.

30:48.212 --> 30:51.215
Listen to your master, boy.

30:51.247 --> 30:53.517
Why do you do this
to yourself, Walker?

31:11.502 --> 31:13.204
Don't you look at me.

31:13.236 --> 31:14.437
Don't you look at me, Private.

31:14.471 --> 31:17.241
- You keep those eyes off me.
- Yes, sir.

31:29.619 --> 31:31.723
I never did like grapefruit...

31:34.224 --> 31:36.093
But my mother made me
eat them.

31:38.762 --> 31:41.099
Now you gonna
hate them too, boy.

31:55.111 --> 31:57.281
Jesus Christ.

32:23.307 --> 32:27.812
Corporal, I promoted you so that you
would be an example for the other men.

32:27.844 --> 32:30.313
- You understand that?
- Yes, sir.

32:32.582 --> 32:34.084
Then you're dismissed.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.273
He was fighting
over a whore, sir.

32:57.307 --> 32:58.709
I'm well aware
of that, Captain.

32:58.742 --> 33:01.311
Boston is no different
than the others.

33:01.344 --> 33:03.179
They're all inferior,

33:03.213 --> 33:04.548
and it disturbs me, Colonel,

33:04.580 --> 33:07.318
when you start to think that
they are more than what they are.

33:07.350 --> 33:09.853
I'm curious
about something, Abner.

33:09.887 --> 33:13.457
Is it his education
that makes you feel inferior?

33:19.362 --> 33:22.765
- Am I dismissed, Colonel?
- No, you are not.

33:22.799 --> 33:24.869
That horse shit today,

33:24.901 --> 33:27.804
I could have
you court martialed.

33:27.838 --> 33:29.706
At the very least,
stripped of your rank.

33:31.742 --> 33:34.678
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

33:37.714 --> 33:39.282
Get out of my sight.

33:55.765 --> 33:58.701
Walker don't mean
nothing to her.

33:58.734 --> 34:01.338
- Don't, Joe.
- Ain't too common.

34:01.370 --> 34:04.841
I mean, look at you.
The way you carry yourself,

34:04.875 --> 34:07.511
the words you be putting out,

34:07.543 --> 34:09.379
boy, you something different.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.315
- Don't tell me what I know now.
- No, thank you.

34:13.817 --> 34:16.253
Boston! Boston!

34:16.286 --> 34:18.455
A man's in trouble.
Come on, now.

34:18.487 --> 34:19.790
Come on.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.210
He wouldn't get behind me,
so I gutted him.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.277
Son of a bitch,
you lying.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.779
- He's ahead of you.
- Well, your boy's dead now.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.915
Drop the knife.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.654
Joe!

34:50.987 --> 34:52.723
Backup's gone now, boy.

34:52.755 --> 34:54.391
You ain't so tough now,
is you?

34:55.891 --> 34:57.727
I'm escorting you
to the police.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.768
For the last time,
you drop that damn knife.

35:05.469 --> 35:07.605
Y'all boys want
some soldier this time?

35:07.638 --> 35:09.940
Hey! Hey!

35:09.973 --> 35:11.708
- He's got a razor.
- Walker, get back.

35:11.741 --> 35:13.243
Who wants to get
behind me now?

35:13.277 --> 35:15.012
Y'all gonna let
this boy arrest me.

35:15.045 --> 35:17.615
- This nigger's crazy.
- Listen to me.

35:17.647 --> 35:19.882
You kill us,
you don't get paid.

35:19.915 --> 35:23.353
You won't see a plug nickel while
they investigate what happened here?

35:23.386 --> 35:25.888
Quartermaster will shut
this place down for months.

35:25.922 --> 35:27.925
Let us pass.

35:27.958 --> 35:32.296
Colonel Norton will see to it
that pay windows reopen today.

35:32.328 --> 35:34.297
You like this boy enough
to not get paid.

35:34.331 --> 35:36.634
You want to feed
your families? Back up!

35:36.667 --> 35:39.569
- Tommy Lee ain't worth it.
- He ain't worth it.

35:39.603 --> 35:41.539
Miller, pick that man up.

35:43.507 --> 35:44.909
We just gonna stand here?

36:01.924 --> 36:03.693
What the hell
is going on here?

36:03.726 --> 36:06.730
Chief Hammond,
as ordered by yourself

36:06.763 --> 36:08.732
and Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Norton,

36:08.764 --> 36:12.502
I have arrested this man for
threatening members of the 24th Infantry

36:12.536 --> 36:14.438
and murdering
a local citizen.

36:28.819 --> 36:29.920
That true?

36:32.589 --> 36:34.891
God damn right.

36:34.924 --> 36:37.327
This is the murder weapon.
Walker...

36:41.031 --> 36:43.034
I place him
in your custody, sir.

36:45.569 --> 36:47.672
Yours now, boy,

36:48.839 --> 36:51.542
- Arrest him.
- All right, let's go.

36:51.574 --> 36:53.944
Not him. Tommy Lee.

36:55.411 --> 36:56.647
What?

36:58.081 --> 36:59.983
You arresting a white man

37:00.016 --> 37:01.819
for killing
that God damn nigger?

37:01.851 --> 37:03.119
That's an order, Cross.

37:03.152 --> 37:05.788
Them solder boys
been shitting all over us.

37:05.822 --> 37:08.392
You shut the hell up
or I'll fire you

37:08.424 --> 37:10.093
as sure as I'm standing here.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.688
<i>Twenty men, sir.</i>

37:38.721 --> 37:42.825
Outnumbered by 20 against four!

37:42.859 --> 37:46.897
Corporal, I watched
a man die, sir.

37:46.929 --> 37:49.433
- I had to look in his face, sir.
- Corporal!

37:49.465 --> 37:51.969
Lower your voice when you
are talking to the Colonel.

37:58.507 --> 38:00.743
We need side arms, sir.

38:00.777 --> 38:03.614
Chief Hammond will not
allow it.

38:05.714 --> 38:07.917
William,

38:07.951 --> 38:10.987
the circumstances here
are not lost on any of us.

38:13.556 --> 38:15.792
Do we have to do it
this way?

38:15.826 --> 38:18.795
The police want to kill you.

38:18.828 --> 38:20.096
Walk with me.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.069
If you had a gun today,

38:25.835 --> 38:27.971
it would be
much worse for you.

38:29.605 --> 38:31.040
You have to believe that.

38:34.076 --> 38:37.415
Hey, y'all. Here comes the man of the day.

38:45.889 --> 38:48.091
What is this, sir?

38:48.123 --> 38:49.959
I believe you're
the first negro

38:49.993 --> 38:55.132
to ever arrest a white man
for murdering another negro.

38:55.165 --> 38:57.167
Congratulations.

38:57.199 --> 38:59.168
Three cheers for Boston.
Hip, hip...

38:59.201 --> 39:00.904
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip...

39:00.936 --> 39:02.639
- Hooray!
- Hip, hip...

39:02.672 --> 39:03.874
Hooray!

39:16.652 --> 39:18.922
Why did you put yourself
out there like that?

39:22.157 --> 39:24.261
- I'm a negro.
- No, You ain't no negro.

39:24.293 --> 39:26.797
- You's a lighty.
- Is that why you hate me?

39:26.830 --> 39:28.799
- You think I got it easier?
- You God damn right,

39:28.831 --> 39:30.000
you got it easier than me.

39:30.032 --> 39:31.935
Look at you, boy.
It's hard for me.

39:31.967 --> 39:34.036
My mom and my papa
were born as slaves.

39:34.069 --> 39:35.437
I don't want to hear
that shit.

39:35.471 --> 39:38.942
In the proclamation they became
teachers at the Freedman's Bureau.

39:40.043 --> 39:42.146
He died in Atlanta in 1906.

39:44.915 --> 39:46.617
You're right.

39:48.183 --> 39:49.486
Yeah.

39:51.121 --> 39:54.057
Their friends,
their community...

39:54.089 --> 39:57.059
They took it upon themselves
to send me overseas

39:57.092 --> 39:59.830
to educate and protect me.

40:01.730 --> 40:05.268
It's the best education
a person could get.

40:05.302 --> 40:08.239
But it separated me
from being colored in America.

40:09.605 --> 40:12.174
I needed to be united
with the legacy

40:12.208 --> 40:14.778
that my parents lived for
and died for.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.613
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

40:17.647 --> 40:20.750
I needed to be united
with the blood in my veins,

40:22.786 --> 40:24.188
so I came here

40:25.621 --> 40:28.993
and here is where
I'm going to stay, Walker.

40:30.259 --> 40:32.161
This is my home now.

40:33.196 --> 40:35.098
Right next to you.

40:35.965 --> 40:38.301
You better not be messin'.

40:38.335 --> 40:40.571
'Cause I ain't have
much family, either.

40:41.670 --> 40:43.806
So, I know what
you're looking for.

40:46.976 --> 40:48.679
I ain't touched her.

40:49.179 --> 40:50.947
I was lying.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.083
She ain't a whore.

40:54.116 --> 40:55.819
She a proper lady.

41:05.161 --> 41:06.863
I'm done.

41:06.895 --> 41:09.232
Just go on back
to your fancy book, boy.

41:29.652 --> 41:31.120
May I have a word?

41:31.154 --> 41:32.755
Are you following me?

41:35.157 --> 41:36.326
Yes.

41:36.993 --> 41:38.761
I don't like being followed.

41:38.795 --> 41:40.263
I just want a moment
of your time.

41:40.295 --> 41:41.897
If this about Zeke,
I'm a grown woman.

41:41.931 --> 41:44.234
- I can speak to whoever I choose.
- Then choose me.

41:48.304 --> 41:50.139
I'd like to buy you a meal.

41:52.775 --> 41:54.177
Please.

41:57.714 --> 41:59.183
Yes, please.

42:01.784 --> 42:02.953
Thank you.

42:05.755 --> 42:06.824
Are you all right?

42:08.991 --> 42:12.161
This is where
the society coloreds eat.

42:12.194 --> 42:15.031
Well, aren't we part
of colored society?

42:16.031 --> 42:18.668
Maybe you, not me.

42:20.170 --> 42:23.206
All you have to do
to be part of colored society

42:23.940 --> 42:25.075
is be colored.

42:28.911 --> 42:30.846
Did you really throw
my flowers away?

42:30.880 --> 42:32.749
- Zeke tell you that?
- Yeah.

42:32.781 --> 42:34.283
Yeah, he did.

42:37.119 --> 42:39.223
I didn't toss your flowers.

42:41.090 --> 42:43.027
I thought they was pretty.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.199
Got any other questions
you wanna ask?

42:49.232 --> 42:51.668
As a matter of fact, I do.

42:52.302 --> 42:56.006
Do you like pork chops?

42:59.007 --> 43:01.744
- Perfect. Sir.
- Yes, sir.

43:01.777 --> 43:04.113
Two pork chop lunches,
please. Thank you.

43:33.810 --> 43:35.446
Why you join the army?

43:36.880 --> 43:38.148
For our rights.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.417
Rights?

43:40.449 --> 43:44.353
Yes. The right to life,

43:44.386 --> 43:47.389
liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness

43:49.159 --> 43:51.361
That's how they say it, right?

43:51.393 --> 43:54.197
Well, we ain't got none of them rights.

43:55.063 --> 43:57.399
All we got is wrongs.

43:57.433 --> 44:00.270
Well, if we get to fight
for America,

44:00.302 --> 44:02.339
we prove we deserve our rights.

44:04.473 --> 44:05.975
What if you die?

44:08.110 --> 44:10.179
Well...

44:10.212 --> 44:13.249
If you die
fighting for justice,

44:13.282 --> 44:16.085
you never really die.

44:17.386 --> 44:19.388
My mother used to say that
to my father

44:19.422 --> 44:20.824
and just like that too,
you know?

44:20.857 --> 44:24.360
"You never really die..."

44:27.063 --> 44:28.799
Ain't you scared?

44:39.909 --> 44:41.311
Not anymore.

44:44.279 --> 44:45.915
William...

44:51.420 --> 44:53.256
I'm not what you might think.

44:55.458 --> 44:57.394
I think you're beautiful.

45:33.429 --> 45:34.965
Boston.

45:39.402 --> 45:41.038
Come on, boy.

45:46.342 --> 45:48.378
Why'd you run off, Joe?

45:50.078 --> 45:53.015
I got a telegram from home.

45:53.049 --> 45:56.253
It was, uh...
It was the fourth of July.

45:58.321 --> 46:01.257
Can't nobody find my sister

46:01.657 --> 46:03.058
or her baby.

46:03.092 --> 46:07.931
So, of course, right after it I
went right home to East St. Louis...

46:09.098 --> 46:12.168
My mama's house.

46:12.201 --> 46:17.240
It was full of bullet holes
I mean, the whole neighborhood.

46:17.272 --> 46:20.176
It looked like Admiral Dewey
blowed it up!

46:23.045 --> 46:27.283
A white mob came through there
like a devil cyclone, killing...

46:37.427 --> 46:39.096
And burning.

46:50.172 --> 46:51.475
Here.

46:52.976 --> 46:54.244
Take this

46:56.145 --> 46:57.547
What is this?

46:57.580 --> 46:59.581
It's mojo.

46:59.614 --> 47:01.450
- It's for protection.
- Protection?

47:03.552 --> 47:05.054
I thought that's what
you were.

47:10.993 --> 47:12.696
You can't fight them and win.

47:14.230 --> 47:16.132
They too strong.

47:16.799 --> 47:19.201
When I see 'em coming, man,

47:19.601 --> 47:21.471
I freeze.

47:21.503 --> 47:23.373
Can't move a muscle.

47:23.406 --> 47:25.542
I could fight over in France,

47:25.574 --> 47:28.244
I ain't afraid of them
but them white folks here...

47:29.712 --> 47:32.449
Oh, they monsters.

47:32.482 --> 47:34.351
And they scare me to death.

47:41.223 --> 47:42.558
I've seen it
first hand.

47:44.259 --> 47:46.662
After they freed them
burrheads,

47:46.696 --> 47:49.598
they swarmed Fort Bend
like a sea of locusts.

47:52.368 --> 47:54.571
They ruin
every God damn thing.

47:56.172 --> 48:00.076
Nigger schools,
nigger colleges...

48:00.109 --> 48:03.045
High sheriff, tax collector.

48:03.078 --> 48:05.114
They both God damn niggers.

48:07.784 --> 48:10.520
White man couldn't even
take a shit

48:10.552 --> 48:12.788
without some
tar baby coming in

48:12.822 --> 48:15.125
right behind wanting
to smell it.

48:21.797 --> 48:23.632
My Pa...

48:25.400 --> 48:27.603
he sittin'
at that kitchen table,

48:28.837 --> 48:30.673
he lost his forearm.

48:31.706 --> 48:33.342
He was crying.

48:34.810 --> 48:36.746
He had this in his hand.

48:40.148 --> 48:42.085
I didn't know

48:42.118 --> 48:44.353
if he was going to use it
on himself...

48:46.322 --> 48:48.025
or me.

48:54.230 --> 48:56.699
"If you ain't better
than a nigger

48:58.400 --> 49:00.536
"you as good as dead."

49:13.782 --> 49:15.118
What are we gonna do, Jimmy?

49:19.188 --> 49:21.657
We're gonna take
our God damn country back.

49:24.594 --> 49:27.297
- Ben.
- Forgive the surprise visit, Charles

49:27.330 --> 49:28.799
Always
a pleasure, sir.

49:31.134 --> 49:32.235
Father's dead.

49:34.337 --> 49:36.373
He passed away
two days ago.

49:37.672 --> 49:39.708
I wanted to
tell you in person.

49:42.911 --> 49:45.415
- Did he suffer?
- No.

49:49.451 --> 49:51.654
I'd like to make you an offer.

49:51.686 --> 49:54.123
A transfer to
the War Department,

49:54.156 --> 49:56.492
Overseeing combat soldiers
in France.

49:56.525 --> 49:58.393
This is great news.

49:58.427 --> 50:01.231
The 24th Infantry
is a crack unit.

50:01.264 --> 50:05.368
- We are drilled, trained...
- The offer is for you,

50:05.400 --> 50:08.605
not your men.

50:08.638 --> 50:13.509
Your decision to stand beside these
negro troops will end in disappointment.

50:16.411 --> 50:18.714
That was always
Father's concern.

50:26.221 --> 50:28.657
When father would speak
to me

50:28.690 --> 50:32.328
about my commanding
colored troops,

50:32.360 --> 50:36.232
he always said the same thing,
that it would get me nowhere in my career.

50:38.301 --> 50:39.802
And now...

50:41.536 --> 50:44.174
you're here
to take his place.

50:45.340 --> 50:46.743
I can't escape this, can I?

50:49.478 --> 50:52.615
All we want is
what's best for you.

50:52.647 --> 50:56.451
Tell me the issues
with my men will be addressed.

50:56.485 --> 50:59.189
These boys are not our men.

50:59.889 --> 51:01.657
They're the cleanup crew.

51:01.690 --> 51:03.525
They're men!

51:03.558 --> 51:05.394
They are my men!

51:06.761 --> 51:08.597
And they have honor.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.399
They deserve better than this.

51:16.938 --> 51:20.877
I always argued to Father
that you were a good soldier.

51:20.909 --> 51:23.212
That you were dealt a bad hand.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.682
But you did the best
you could.

51:25.714 --> 51:29.651
We're the only ones
left, Charles.

51:29.685 --> 51:32.489
I'm counting on you
to make our family proud.

52:05.855 --> 52:06.856
Gentlemen,

52:08.056 --> 52:10.959
I present your new
commanding officer.

52:10.993 --> 52:13.462
Major Abner Lockhart.

52:13.929 --> 52:15.831
Major Lockhart,

52:16.866 --> 52:18.268
the battalion is yours.

52:25.975 --> 52:28.344
- First, Sergeant Hayes.
- Sir.

52:29.311 --> 52:31.413
Dismiss the men.

52:31.714 --> 52:33.282
Sir.

52:40.322 --> 52:43.525
All right, company.
Dismissed.

52:45.728 --> 52:47.998
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Congratulations.

52:54.369 --> 52:55.739
Boston.

53:00.743 --> 53:04.447
William, I know
you have concerns,

53:04.480 --> 53:09.552
but I've had a very stern
conversation with Major Lockhart

53:09.585 --> 53:11.888
about how to treat you men
in the future.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.389
I believe he will serve
in my stead,

53:14.422 --> 53:16.959
and I believe
he will protect you.

53:17.226 --> 53:19.529
Sir.

53:19.561 --> 53:22.331
Captain Lockhart
doesn't understand.

53:22.364 --> 53:24.366
I have the scars to prove it.

53:25.634 --> 53:28.737
How did Washington
respond to your reports?

53:28.770 --> 53:32.808
Racially charged complaints
are never received well

53:32.842 --> 53:35.645
- at the War Department.
- Then what do we do, sir?

53:35.677 --> 53:38.513
You leave.

53:38.547 --> 53:42.752
Go to officer training school in
Des Moines and make a difference.

53:42.784 --> 53:44.687
I thought we had a deal.

53:45.420 --> 53:46.790
We did.

53:48.391 --> 53:50.460
- It's time for you to leave.
- No, sir.

53:50.493 --> 53:53.929
The deal was we were going
to be treated as soldiers

53:53.962 --> 53:55.731
and as men, sir.

53:55.764 --> 53:58.835
William, I've done
all I can do here.

53:58.868 --> 54:00.869
I hope you take
my advice.

54:02.071 --> 54:03.906
Good luck, William.

54:13.915 --> 54:15.384
Boston...

54:19.487 --> 54:21.523
So, Lockhart in charge now?

54:23.159 --> 54:25.061
What that mean for us?

54:35.737 --> 54:37.973
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

54:38.007 --> 54:39.309
Why would I want to go?

54:39.342 --> 54:42.145
Becoming an officer won't end the
hell we're going through here.

54:42.177 --> 54:43.880
I'd just be
another Uncle Tom

54:43.913 --> 54:45.481
who couldn't cut it
with his own people.

54:45.514 --> 54:46.649
- That's what they say.
- Who?

54:46.681 --> 54:48.685
Everybody. The 24th...

54:51.554 --> 54:52.655
Me.

54:55.623 --> 54:58.395
Everybody. There's
no honor in that.

55:00.029 --> 55:02.031
People say things
they don't know.

55:02.063 --> 55:03.565
Don't make 'em true.

55:04.799 --> 55:08.537
My daddy had a storefront
church, right down in San Felipe

55:09.904 --> 55:11.975
I played piano every service.

55:14.076 --> 55:16.612
Daddy's deacon,

55:17.913 --> 55:19.416
Johnny Tibbs,

55:20.982 --> 55:23.852
he was a good talker.

55:23.886 --> 55:27.857
Church was riding high
and Daddy...

55:32.962 --> 55:35.498
Daddy loved him
some Johnny.

55:41.703 --> 55:44.172
One evening after
choir let out,

55:44.206 --> 55:46.542
Johnny and I was alone,

55:46.574 --> 55:50.647
and he asked me
to be his gal.

55:53.281 --> 55:55.117
I said no.

55:58.554 --> 56:00.456
That didn't stop him.

56:05.860 --> 56:07.096
He...

56:13.201 --> 56:15.138
He had his way with me.

56:21.643 --> 56:22.978
And Daddy blamed me.

56:25.848 --> 56:27.183
Called me a jezebel.

56:28.884 --> 56:30.587
Put me out in the street.

56:35.623 --> 56:37.759
Whole town thought
I was this whore

56:37.793 --> 56:40.964
who tried to take advantage
of the good deacon.

56:53.708 --> 56:57.078
But I ain't gonna
lay down and die

56:57.112 --> 57:00.016
'cause people think
I'm something I ain't.

57:16.799 --> 57:18.735
I was robbed of my honor.

57:21.235 --> 57:23.940
You get outta here
before they take yours too.

57:27.743 --> 57:28.777
You come with me.

57:34.650 --> 57:36.019
Oh, please.

57:37.353 --> 57:38.555
Please.

57:40.723 --> 57:41.724
Depends...

57:43.726 --> 57:46.262
Can I bring my piano?

57:46.295 --> 57:50.900
I would never separate
a woman from her piano.

57:50.933 --> 57:53.670
- Never?
- No, never.

57:55.170 --> 57:56.272
Never.

58:12.955 --> 58:15.290
I'd like to attend officer training
school, First Sergeant.

58:15.324 --> 58:17.393
I heard you declined.

58:17.426 --> 58:18.962
I changed my mind,
First Sergeant.

58:19.795 --> 58:21.130
Surprise, surprise.

58:22.096 --> 58:23.899
My Roosevelt was your Norton.

58:25.868 --> 58:27.902
How does it feel
to be a damn fool?

58:27.935 --> 58:29.337
I'm not a fool, First Sergeant.

58:29.371 --> 58:30.906
Now you gonna cut and run.

58:30.938 --> 58:32.241
I'm not running,
First Sergeant.

58:32.273 --> 58:33.842
My daddy was like you.

58:35.009 --> 58:37.112
Soldier wanted to help
the white man.

58:38.179 --> 58:39.281
Told me, "Son...

58:40.815 --> 58:42.118
"this a white man's world.

58:44.018 --> 58:46.022
"You gotta play by
the white man's rules."

58:48.190 --> 58:49.258
Yeah, well,

58:50.292 --> 58:52.161
I saw what helping took him.

58:53.395 --> 58:55.163
The same place it took me.

58:56.732 --> 58:59.701
Same place it took you.

59:00.703 --> 59:02.071
Niggaville.

59:05.406 --> 59:09.144
Every man here
has got a lit fuse.

59:09.177 --> 59:11.380
But you thought you were
better than most.

59:11.413 --> 59:14.884
Thought you could get
chummy with that white man.

59:16.185 --> 59:19.688
Norton, he onto
greener pastures,

59:19.721 --> 59:20.756
and you here.

59:21.389 --> 59:23.092
Sick...

59:23.125 --> 59:25.661
crying to another nigga
about being a nigga.

59:27.228 --> 59:30.265
Well, welcome to the club.
We all sick of it.

59:30.299 --> 59:33.768
Watching our boys come though that
gate head bloodied, beat up by the law

59:33.802 --> 59:35.438
but you ain't got to
worry about that no more.

59:35.471 --> 59:37.840
Do ya, Corporal?

59:37.873 --> 59:39.141
'Cause you running.

59:39.174 --> 59:40.743
And what about you?

59:42.511 --> 59:45.014
You playing boy
with your "Yes, sir.

59:45.047 --> 59:46.749
"No, sir.

59:46.781 --> 59:48.750
"Be on my way, sir."

59:50.319 --> 59:53.723
You won't even look
that white man in his eye.

59:55.824 --> 59:57.193
I'm the one who's running?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.297
At least what I did
made a difference,

01:00:02.297 --> 01:00:03.465
First Sergeant.

01:00:03.498 --> 01:00:05.900
You right.

01:00:05.933 --> 01:00:08.303
You the first colored man
to ever arrest a white man

01:00:08.337 --> 01:00:10.039
for killing a colored man.

01:00:10.072 --> 01:00:11.374
You made a difference.

01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:15.844
The judge just released him.

01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:17.746
No charges.

01:00:20.114 --> 01:00:23.018
Norton told me that
on his way out the door.

01:00:34.429 --> 01:00:38.134
I'll get Major Lockhart to put your
papers through as you requested.

01:00:40.002 --> 01:00:41.471
Get out of my face.

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:09.198
The clouds
is gathering.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.933
We might get us
a little weather.

01:01:12.034 --> 01:01:13.335
Maybe it'll hold.

01:01:13.368 --> 01:01:16.304
Yeah? You think so?
Hope it does.

01:01:17.339 --> 01:01:18.474
Listen up.

01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:22.378
I got something to tell you.

01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:24.846
I'm leaving.

01:01:26.547 --> 01:01:31.119
They are sending me to
officer training school.

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:32.788
What, you gonna be an officer?

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:41.596
Boss is gonna be a captain.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.599
What you gonna do
when you Lieutenant Boss, huh?

01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:46.467
Well, Davids,
I'm going to France.

01:01:50.572 --> 01:01:52.975
<i>♪ Over there</i>

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:56.011

01:02:25.107 --> 01:02:27.643
Y'all quit shooting

01:02:27.676 --> 01:02:29.110
What'd you say to me?

01:02:29.143 --> 01:02:30.979
You almost killed my baby.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:33.348
Watch where you shootin', mister.

01:02:38.386 --> 01:02:40.055
Mr. Cross, I didn't mean
nothing by it.

01:02:43.058 --> 01:02:45.061
- Get out of my way, bitch.
- No!

01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:49.866
Hey, you little nigga baby.

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.500
Hey, you gonna shut up?

01:02:52.534 --> 01:02:54.503
- Don't touch him.
- Oh, you'll shut up now.

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:04.547
I didn't mean nothing by it.

01:03:16.223 --> 01:03:17.459
Got something else to say to me?

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.962
You got something
to say to me now, huh?

01:03:20.996 --> 01:03:23.465
Do you need to beg? Evans!

01:03:23.498 --> 01:03:26.368
- Evans! Come get this dang bitch.
- No!

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.503
- Evans.
- No!

01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:31.105
- Lock this bitch up.
- No!

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.943
Best call it in first.
Don't want no trouble from Hammond.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.345
I don't give a shit
about Hammond. I said,

01:03:36.377 --> 01:03:38.013
- lock her up.
- This ain't right.

01:03:43.284 --> 01:03:44.920
Come on, get outta here!

01:03:47.621 --> 01:03:50.292
My baby, please!

01:03:50.324 --> 01:03:52.194
Somebody he...

01:03:52.226 --> 01:03:54.128
Shut your goddamn mouth!

01:03:54.161 --> 01:03:55.563
Come on. Get this shit up.

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:00.436
Yeah, this is Evans.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:03.172
Let Chief know we got
a nigga female we bringing in.

01:04:04.105 --> 01:04:06.574
Cross, you
son of a bitch!

01:04:08.743 --> 01:04:12.113
Get off me, nigga.

01:04:12.147 --> 01:04:14.049
- Get off me.
- Funny to hit on people?

01:04:15.784 --> 01:04:17.052
Goddammit.

01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:31.232
Boss. They got one of your boys.

01:04:31.266 --> 01:04:33.435
- Who?
- The police. Nearly beat him to death.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:35.670
- They bled him like a stuck pig.
- Who are you talking about, McGhee?

01:04:35.703 --> 01:04:37.505
One of yours.
What's his name, Dawson...

01:04:37.538 --> 01:04:39.140
No, Davids. That's it.

01:04:39.174 --> 01:04:40.275
- Davids?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:40.308 --> 01:04:42.078
- You sure?
- Come on now.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.418
Wait.

01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:53.054
What's going on?

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:56.257
A soldier's in trouble.
I'm gonna be late.

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:57.558
Why don't you come inside
with me.

01:04:57.592 --> 01:04:58.761
- I can't, Marie.
- Please.

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.563
I'll be right back, okay?

01:05:01.596 --> 01:05:03.065
I promise you,
I'll be right back.

01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:04.532
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

01:05:04.565 --> 01:05:05.567
I promise.

01:05:14.241 --> 01:05:15.377
Cross.

01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:18.147
You detained one of my soldiers.

01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:19.681
I need him released
to my custody.

01:05:19.714 --> 01:05:22.583
I think he's talking about
that nigga we whipped upon.

01:05:22.616 --> 01:05:25.486
Was he livin' when we left him?

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:28.157
Pissing and shitting himself.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:30.626
- If that constitutes living.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.661
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:34.730
- I am Corporal...
- I know who you are.

01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:37.632
- I'm being nicer than I need to be.
- Boston! Boston is my name.

01:05:37.665 --> 01:05:41.235
Provost Guard. Assigned to protect
the men of the 24th Infantry

01:05:41.268 --> 01:05:43.604
and I am demanding
that you take my soldier

01:05:43.638 --> 01:05:45.674
out from whatever
fucking hole you put him in!

01:05:46.373 --> 01:05:47.409
Now.

01:05:48.743 --> 01:05:49.779
All right.

01:05:50.545 --> 01:05:51.547
We're good here.

01:05:52.447 --> 01:05:53.449
It's all good.

01:06:35.357 --> 01:06:36.525
They killed Boston.

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:38.761
What?

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.229
And Davids too.

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:43.232
Whole mob of them
coming to finish us off.

01:06:43.264 --> 01:06:44.465
Who said that?

01:06:44.498 --> 01:06:45.834
The colored man
came in from town.

01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:49.171
They killed him.

01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:50.773
They killed him!

01:07:17.799 --> 01:07:19.534
What the hell is going on here?

01:07:19.567 --> 01:07:23.705
Sir, two of my mens was killed
today in Houston City limits.

01:07:23.737 --> 01:07:26.507
We just got word that the local
police and the white citizens

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.243
of Houston have
declared war on us.

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:30.279
In fact, they could be
on their way right now.

01:07:30.311 --> 01:07:32.714
- First Sergeant, you tell these men to put down the guns.
- Sir...

01:07:32.746 --> 01:07:34.282
Tell them to out down
the guns!

01:07:36.784 --> 01:07:38.853
I was there

01:07:38.886 --> 01:07:42.890
that December day in the Philippines
when nine boys from the 24th

01:07:42.924 --> 01:07:46.929
rounded 100 of them son of a
bitch Filipinos out the trenches.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.364
You hear me? One hundred!

01:07:49.397 --> 01:07:51.199
We didn't lose
a single man that day.

01:07:51.232 --> 01:07:53.801
I done lost two tonight.
I'll be damned if I lose another, sir.

01:07:53.835 --> 01:07:55.103
Let me rephrase.

01:07:55.136 --> 01:07:59.174
Tell my men to
put down those damn guns, now!

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.282
No, sir.

01:08:07.315 --> 01:08:09.650
Not as long as my men
are in danger, sir.

01:08:09.683 --> 01:08:11.352
Do you wanna lose them stripes?

01:08:12.286 --> 01:08:13.355
No, sir.

01:08:13.388 --> 01:08:14.889
How about
a goddamn court-martial.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.495
- No, sir.
- Then you do what I fucking command!

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.531
Right now!

01:08:37.879 --> 01:08:39.548
Put the weapons away.

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:44.520
Put 'em away.

01:08:54.728 --> 01:08:56.029
Now, I'm going into Houston,

01:08:56.063 --> 01:08:57.799
I will get down
to the bottom of this.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.305
You lock down this armory and don't
you give another goddamn order.

01:09:04.337 --> 01:09:06.006
You understand me,
First Sergeant?

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.843
Do you understand me?

01:09:10.477 --> 01:09:12.279
Yes, Sir.

01:09:12.313 --> 01:09:13.848
Give me your armory key.

01:09:53.386 --> 01:09:54.489
Jesus.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:56.725
Give me a towel for this man.

01:09:59.727 --> 01:10:00.828
Where's Davids?

01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:03.731
They said they didn't know.

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.301
They can't find him.

01:10:06.401 --> 01:10:08.671
He may be dead.
Hell, who knows.

01:10:15.043 --> 01:10:17.446
Look, we have a problem.

01:10:17.478 --> 01:10:19.414
The men think
there's a militia on the way.

01:10:21.148 --> 01:10:23.051
Are they?

01:10:23.084 --> 01:10:26.822
I need you to do everything in your
power to allay this excitement.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:30.092
You make it clear that this
incident did not amount to anything.

01:10:30.924 --> 01:10:32.393
Do you understand?

01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:33.862
You want me to lie.

01:10:33.895 --> 01:10:35.364
Yes, you lie, goddammit!

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:37.532
And no more talk of Davids.

01:10:38.732 --> 01:10:40.002
We need to keep order.

01:10:43.737 --> 01:10:47.609
Now, as you can see,
Corporal Boston is alive.

01:10:50.779 --> 01:10:55.450
But it is foolhardy to think about
taking the law into your own hands.

01:10:55.482 --> 01:10:58.753
I will personally see to it
that this man Cross

01:10:58.786 --> 01:11:00.922
is ejected
from the police force.

01:11:00.954 --> 01:11:02.122
All the police
is like that.

01:11:02.155 --> 01:11:04.392
- What do we do what they beat us again?
- Report it to me.

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.160
- Where's Davids?
- You know the mob's coming for us next.

01:11:06.194 --> 01:11:08.696
A white mob, the whole town
is talking about it.

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:10.999
Listen, you gotta get us up outta here.
You gotta get us outta here right now!

01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:13.634
- I don't have the authority to do that.
- Then who has the authority?

01:11:13.668 --> 01:11:15.137
First Sergeant,
control your men.

01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:16.837
I'm fed up! We fed up!

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:18.672
We can't go nowhere, sir!

01:11:18.705 --> 01:11:21.642
Boston needs a medic,
Davids' gone! What we doing?

01:11:21.676 --> 01:11:23.879
Sergeant Hayes,
you take control of the men.

01:11:25.446 --> 01:11:27.815
Where you going, sir?

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:29.584
I'm going to call
the Chief of Police.

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:50.038
They coming!

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.179
Argh!

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.615
- All hell done broke lose.
- With me!

01:12:00.647 --> 01:12:02.183
It's a mob of white folks!

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:04.953
- What?
- It's a mob of white folks!

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.989
Which way did they go?

01:12:08.121 --> 01:12:10.959
Private, which way did they go?

01:12:12.125 --> 01:12:13.594
That way.

01:12:16.998 --> 01:12:18.200
I'm on it.

01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:23.838
Fire!

01:12:24.638 --> 01:12:26.441
Fire goddammit!

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:42.491
Arm yourselves.

01:12:49.062 --> 01:12:51.900
All right, men.
Get your head on.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:53.133
Get your bayonets.

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:54.837
Arm yourselves.

01:13:39.614 --> 01:13:40.715
Halt!

01:13:41.348 --> 01:13:43.584
Hold platoon, move!

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.757
Forward march!

01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:01.703
Front rank kneel.

01:14:02.536 --> 01:14:04.271
What the hell
are you niggas doing?

01:14:04.304 --> 01:14:05.706
Squad aim.

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:10.111
Squad fire.

01:14:15.383 --> 01:14:16.952
Front rank stand.

01:14:18.119 --> 01:14:20.054
Right!

01:14:20.088 --> 01:14:22.590
This is our France.

01:14:30.597 --> 01:14:34.602
Now look, these niggas give up,
you let me handle it. You hear?

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.905
You're civilians.
Don't you forget that.

01:14:36.937 --> 01:14:38.306
The law run this town,

01:14:38.338 --> 01:14:39.640
and nobody else.

01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:41.642
Fire!

01:15:22.049 --> 01:15:23.150
What the hell
are you doing, Chief?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.821
- It's for our own good, Cross.
- Just let me outta here.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.188
I can fix the city.

01:15:28.222 --> 01:15:29.992
You only make it worse.

01:15:31.758 --> 01:15:32.860
Chief?

01:15:33.794 --> 01:15:34.962
Chief?

01:15:34.995 --> 01:15:36.063
Chief!

01:15:59.486 --> 01:16:02.023
You niggas done lost
your goddamn minds.

01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:03.859
Form skirmish order.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.961
Put your goddamn guns down,
we'll let you live. You hear?

01:16:06.994 --> 01:16:09.030
Boston. Boy,
I showed you some respect.

01:16:09.062 --> 01:16:10.865
- You show me some now.
- Take aim.

01:16:11.398 --> 01:16:13.234
Dammit, it's the law!

01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:15.003
Fire!

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.255
Uh-oh.

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.459
Little boy's still alive.

01:16:40.962 --> 01:16:45.133
Hey man...
Oh, you need some help?

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:46.900
All right, come on,
let me help you out here.

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:48.436
Come on. Get your ass up.

01:16:48.468 --> 01:16:50.771
Come on. Come on.
Get up.

01:16:51.972 --> 01:16:53.273
Hey, you need some help.

01:16:53.307 --> 01:16:54.910
Here you go, boy,
I got you.

01:17:21.235 --> 01:17:22.270
Joe.

01:17:39.219 --> 01:17:40.489
He needed some help.

01:17:55.035 --> 01:17:56.137
Say,

01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:58.405
you boys on night maneuvers?

01:18:46.087 --> 01:18:47.321
You smell that?

01:18:48.556 --> 01:18:49.891
It's blood.

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.062
Yeah, but there ain't nobody
innocent here, soldier.

01:18:55.663 --> 01:18:58.500
Not them, not us...

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.901
Nobody.

01:19:15.482 --> 01:19:17.118
Look in front.

01:19:17.951 --> 01:19:19.654
Wait. Wait!

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:21.890
- Is it the police?
- Hold your fire!

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.023
Hold your fire!

01:19:23.723 --> 01:19:25.426
Stop!

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.028
Stop!

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:31.065
What's going on?

01:19:31.097 --> 01:19:32.566
- You got any weapons?
- No.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.236
No, my wife, she just had a
baby I'm drivin' 'em home.

01:19:40.607 --> 01:19:42.377
Drive through.

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.979
Don't slow down, don't look back.
Come on.

01:19:45.012 --> 01:19:47.014
- Thank you.
- They're not police.

01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.316
Hold your fire.

01:19:49.683 --> 01:19:51.151
Clear a way.
Clear a way, y'all.

01:19:54.321 --> 01:19:56.356
Boston. The fuck
is your problem?

01:19:56.389 --> 01:19:59.360
- Hey, Clinton.
- What, they beat on your head too hard, boy?

01:19:59.392 --> 01:20:01.361
We should have killed 'em.
They can identify us!

01:20:01.395 --> 01:20:03.531
- Clinton, calm yourself.
- Hey.

01:20:03.563 --> 01:20:06.034
- A machine's coming.
- Machine!

01:20:08.602 --> 01:20:11.371
- Sarge, what we doing?
- Hold your fire!

01:20:11.405 --> 01:20:13.608
- What we doing, Sarge?
- Sarge, what we doing?

01:20:14.508 --> 01:20:15.543
Wait.

01:20:15.575 --> 01:20:18.012
Wait!

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.290
Walker, take a look.
See what's what.

01:20:29.523 --> 01:20:30.592
No.

01:20:32.058 --> 01:20:33.227
You, Boston.

01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:06.494
What?

01:21:15.035 --> 01:21:16.070
What?

01:21:18.405 --> 01:21:19.540
Army.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:22.677
They're not police,
this one's a captain.

01:21:23.677 --> 01:21:25.146
Oh, shit!

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.014
Boston.

01:21:28.182 --> 01:21:29.351
Shit!

01:21:30.785 --> 01:21:32.787
Army.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.223
- National Guard.
- No, don't say that.

01:21:37.223 --> 01:21:38.560
Shit!

01:21:40.093 --> 01:21:41.695
Why the fuck we shooting
at soldiers?

01:21:43.563 --> 01:21:45.665
Goddammit! What...

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.668
What was we supposed to do?

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.570
One of you niggas
get us up outta here!

01:22:07.554 --> 01:22:08.623
Sarge...

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.361
It's over now.

01:22:17.231 --> 01:22:18.366
What we gonna do?

01:22:20.234 --> 01:22:22.102
Well, you know
the answer to that.

01:22:24.637 --> 01:22:27.274
We done soldier together
long time,

01:22:27.307 --> 01:22:28.308
you and me.

01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:30.244
Yeah.

01:22:41.288 --> 01:22:43.424
We can go back to camp.
They might not be dead.

01:22:43.456 --> 01:22:44.825
I ain't going back
to camp no more.

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:49.431
There ain't no more honor
in this world for me.

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:51.532
No.

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:56.170
No, I ain't doing that.

01:22:58.672 --> 01:23:00.375
Looks like it's
your lucky day, Boston.

01:23:03.276 --> 01:23:05.212
For all the hell
I done put you through.

01:23:07.447 --> 01:23:08.782
Let me have it.

01:23:29.469 --> 01:23:31.505
You holster that weapon
right now, Boston.

01:23:33.173 --> 01:23:34.475
So long, soldier.

01:23:38.879 --> 01:23:40.548
Sarge, you ain't got to do this.

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.185
Goodbye.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:55.757
I'm not going to shoot you,
First Sergeant.

01:24:57.523 --> 01:24:59.227
I didn't think you would.

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:19.246
You don't have to do this.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.748
Then let them do it for me?

01:25:21.347 --> 01:25:22.649
No.

01:25:23.616 --> 01:25:25.852
Army was my whole life.

01:25:26.919 --> 01:25:28.388
That's over now.

01:25:28.922 --> 01:25:31.426
We crossed that line.

01:25:34.895 --> 01:25:36.397
You...

01:25:37.865 --> 01:25:39.400
are no actor.

01:25:42.835 --> 01:25:45.772
I was the one wearing the mask.

01:25:48.875 --> 01:25:50.410
That's over now.

01:26:31.951 --> 01:26:34.387
Don't you boys move.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.722
Stay right there.

01:26:36.322 --> 01:26:37.792
Hand over your weapons.

01:26:41.527 --> 01:26:42.664
Do it now.

01:27:35.115 --> 01:27:36.884
No! Oh, no!

01:27:39.453 --> 01:27:40.687
No!

01:27:41.655 --> 01:27:42.923
No!

01:27:42.955 --> 01:27:45.659
Get off me! Get off me!

01:27:45.691 --> 01:27:47.594
Hey! No! Don't you touch her!

01:27:47.628 --> 01:27:49.163
Don't you touch her!

01:27:49.195 --> 01:27:50.864
You stay with me!

01:27:50.897 --> 01:27:52.366
You stay with me!

01:27:53.767 --> 01:27:55.670
She's strong.
She gonna be okay.

01:28:25.699 --> 01:28:26.868
Have a seat.

01:28:45.252 --> 01:28:47.554
Thought you'd be
in France by now.

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:49.557
It seems another war
took precedence.

01:28:53.794 --> 01:28:56.464
Rather ironic place for a court
martial, don't you think?

01:28:58.065 --> 01:28:59.567
And they're
a young couple.

01:29:01.101 --> 01:29:02.703
I was married here.

01:29:10.177 --> 01:29:11.212
Did you do this?

01:29:15.615 --> 01:29:17.651
This is a perfect place
for a wedding.

01:29:20.721 --> 01:29:24.459
William, what I'm about to
say to you violates

01:29:25.124 --> 01:29:27.694
my moral code

01:29:27.727 --> 01:29:29.230
to the depths of my soul,
but I have to say it.

01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:32.933
If someone doesn't testify...

01:29:34.234 --> 01:29:35.837
for the prosecution

01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:41.007
they are going to execute
every last man.

01:29:46.579 --> 01:29:47.914
You want me to name the men?

01:29:49.749 --> 01:29:50.817
Someone has to.

01:29:52.218 --> 01:29:53.487
Okay.

01:29:56.822 --> 01:29:59.627
Corporal William Boston.
I was there.

01:30:00.861 --> 01:30:04.098
The weapon that they found you
with had not been discharged.

01:30:04.130 --> 01:30:05.833
I was there.

01:30:05.865 --> 01:30:07.935
They need someone

01:30:07.968 --> 01:30:10.170
who was against the mutiny.

01:30:10.203 --> 01:30:11.839
Someone that they can trust

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.674
and respect.

01:30:18.712 --> 01:30:20.748
Trust and respect?

01:30:22.615 --> 01:30:23.650
The good one?

01:30:23.683 --> 01:30:24.717
It's who you are.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.887
You're a good man.

01:30:27.053 --> 01:30:29.222
If it's not you,
they'll find someone else.

01:30:29.255 --> 01:30:30.758
- So be it.
- You'd rather die?

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:33.060
Yes! With honor.

01:30:33.093 --> 01:30:34.828
There's no honor

01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:36.697
in killing innocent people.

01:30:36.996 --> 01:30:38.231
Innocent?

01:30:38.264 --> 01:30:41.035
I should've never taken
the transfer.

01:30:41.067 --> 01:30:43.003
I should've never
left you men behind.

01:30:45.137 --> 01:30:47.542
None of us are absolved.

01:30:48.808 --> 01:30:49.976
William...

01:30:51.344 --> 01:30:54.847
help me save your life.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:56.749
No!

01:30:56.782 --> 01:30:58.785
The actions I took with the men

01:30:58.819 --> 01:31:01.722
come from the same self
you find worthy of saving.

01:31:02.388 --> 01:31:04.257
If I am worth it,

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.759
then so is every man
in this regiment

01:31:06.793 --> 01:31:08.228
that marched on Houston.

01:31:08.261 --> 01:31:10.030
I am them and they are me.

01:31:10.062 --> 01:31:13.132
You can make a difference.

01:31:13.165 --> 01:31:16.971
You can go to officer training,
become an officer.

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.272
You can affect the careers

01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:20.273
of thousands of
colored soldiers.

01:31:20.941 --> 01:31:22.009
I am them...

01:31:23.343 --> 01:31:24.779
- and they are...
- Damn it!

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.121
William?

01:31:36.722 --> 01:31:37.792
Do you have a girl?

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:42.597
What's her name?

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:44.699
Marie.

01:31:45.264 --> 01:31:46.334
Do you love her?

01:31:49.201 --> 01:31:50.870
With all my heart.

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:54.709
She must be quite distraught.

01:31:59.045 --> 01:32:00.213
I imagine so.

01:32:10.322 --> 01:32:12.058
I didn't fire my gun...

01:32:15.195 --> 01:32:17.063
but I wanted to kill them...

01:32:18.964 --> 01:32:20.935
just as much as the others did.

01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:27.107
Every time they spit...

01:32:29.875 --> 01:32:31.012
they pissed...

01:32:33.045 --> 01:32:34.380
they'd beat us down,

01:32:34.414 --> 01:32:37.084
I could, I could feel it.

01:32:39.119 --> 01:32:40.388
I could feel it.

01:32:42.121 --> 01:32:43.190
Hate...

01:32:47.093 --> 01:32:48.995
But when I aimed the gun...

01:32:51.897 --> 01:32:53.833
Oh, God, help me.

01:32:55.067 --> 01:32:56.736
Oh, help me.

01:32:59.239 --> 01:33:00.775
I saw a man...

01:33:02.142 --> 01:33:04.211
I saw a man...

01:33:08.048 --> 01:33:09.417
And you know the thing?

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.287
He didn't see one back.

01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.061
I won't stay unheard forever.

01:33:22.094 --> 01:33:24.464
You keep
pushing people down,

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:27.401
sooner or later they rise up...

01:33:29.268 --> 01:33:30.737
and they won't see a man...

01:33:33.906 --> 01:33:35.042
they'll see murder.

01:33:42.281 --> 01:33:45.285
If death is the price
for a night of justice...

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:50.190
I'm ready to pay it.

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:54.061
My answer is no.

01:33:56.096 --> 01:33:57.263
No.

01:34:03.536 --> 01:34:04.938
No.

01:34:16.182 --> 01:34:17.752
You should be on your way.

01:34:20.853 --> 01:34:22.490
I told you
when I first met you...

01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:27.428
that I admired service.

01:34:29.862 --> 01:34:32.266
Sacrifice over ambition.

01:34:34.534 --> 01:34:35.902
I always will.

01:34:39.338 --> 01:34:40.440
I know.

01:34:48.181 --> 01:34:49.450
Goodbye, William.

01:35:04.063 --> 01:35:05.199
Goodbye...

01:35:06.298 --> 01:35:07.333
Charles.

01:35:33.226 --> 01:35:35.929
We call Private
Cleator Lucky to the stand.

01:35:42.302 --> 01:35:43.603
God damn Judas.

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.039
He's a kid.

01:35:47.072 --> 01:35:49.442
Private Lucky has been
given immunity for his testimony.

01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:51.411
Good for him.

01:35:53.346 --> 01:35:55.648
Was there a belief
among the men

01:35:55.682 --> 01:35:58.285
that Private David's was killed
by the local police?

01:35:58.685 --> 01:36:00.219
Yes, sir.

01:36:00.253 --> 01:36:01.355
Was he dead?

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.857
No, sir.

01:36:03.624 --> 01:36:05.492
They just had beat him
awful bad.

01:36:06.459 --> 01:36:07.494
Point him out to us.

01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:16.170
Private, please stand.

01:36:23.575 --> 01:36:24.643
Private Lucky,

01:36:24.677 --> 01:36:27.548
can you identify any of
the leaders of the mutiny?

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.352
Private Walker there.

01:36:34.654 --> 01:36:36.322
Him and Private Franklin,

01:36:37.423 --> 01:36:38.892
Miller...

01:36:40.192 --> 01:36:41.462
Wilson and Taylor there.

01:36:42.728 --> 01:36:44.530
They charged the armor
and took the weapons.

01:36:45.565 --> 01:36:46.634
Gave 'em out.

01:36:50.169 --> 01:36:51.570
And Big Joe, he yelled...

01:36:51.603 --> 01:36:54.340
They're coming!

01:36:54.374 --> 01:36:55.709
Was there a mob?

01:36:55.741 --> 01:36:58.244
No, sir.

01:36:58.277 --> 01:37:00.547
Matter of fact was that there was
nothing out there but an old cow.

01:37:03.016 --> 01:37:05.686
The false mob,
was that the signal to mutiny?

01:37:06.652 --> 01:37:08.187
Yes, sir, I believe so.

01:37:09.755 --> 01:37:11.357
Will you men please stand.

01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:24.405
Walker told
Private Jackson, Anderson,

01:37:26.039 --> 01:37:28.709
Lamon White, Anthony Harris,

01:37:31.177 --> 01:37:35.281
Ennis Clark, they all wanted
to go to town and raise Cain.

01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:40.521
Sergeant Clinton and Sergeant
Hayes, they's led the march.

01:37:42.288 --> 01:37:43.723
Will you man stand.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.335
Private,

01:37:56.369 --> 01:37:58.505
who was the other key figure
in the mutiny?

01:38:02.542 --> 01:38:03.710
Come on, Private.

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:05.479
Who was it?

01:38:17.824 --> 01:38:20.527
Corporal William Boston.

01:38:21.761 --> 01:38:23.297
What was his role?

01:38:24.364 --> 01:38:25.632
Well, sir...

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.703
We all looked up to Boston.

01:38:32.271 --> 01:38:34.307
And when he come back all beat
up and picked up a rifle...

01:38:36.342 --> 01:38:37.544
That was it.

01:38:41.414 --> 01:38:43.317
It's when I made my mind to go.

01:38:46.186 --> 01:38:48.255
I know it was the same
for every man there.

01:38:52.725 --> 01:38:55.462
Boston's the most educated fellow I
seen, colored or white.

01:39:00.633 --> 01:39:03.137
And for him to have all that
and be whooped upon like that...

01:39:06.505 --> 01:39:08.609
nothing seemed to matter
no more.

01:39:12.779 --> 01:39:14.714
We felt we weren't
all men...

01:39:16.449 --> 01:39:18.218
if we didn't march too.

01:39:22.454 --> 01:39:23.756
Yes, sir.

01:39:26.793 --> 01:39:28.161
Boston's the one.

01:39:32.365 --> 01:39:34.134
He the real reason
we all done it.

01:39:35.301 --> 01:39:36.602
Corporal
William Boston.

01:39:38.771 --> 01:39:40.340
Rise and stand with the man.

01:39:49.648 --> 01:39:50.750
You boys

01:39:51.784 --> 01:39:53.120
have dishonored our nation...

01:39:54.387 --> 01:39:57.224
and betrayed your oath to protect
the people of this country.

01:39:59.792 --> 01:40:01.361
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.203
I am a man.

01:40:15.441 --> 01:40:16.443
I'm a man.

01:40:20.646 --> 01:40:21.714
I am a man.

01:40:24.784 --> 01:40:26.753
- I'm a man.
- I am a man.

01:40:26.785 --> 01:40:28.587
I am a man.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.788
Take them away.

01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:31.525
I am a man.

01:40:54.614 --> 01:40:56.750
I am a man!

01:40:56.782 --> 01:40:58.384
I am a man!
