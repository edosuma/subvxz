THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:13.972 --> 00:16.016
You must be very busy, Mr. Jung.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.647
I went to the trouble of sailing
all the way here,

00:24.566 --> 00:26.860
and I'm not even sure if I can meet you.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.571
I'll come right over to you.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.075
I'll see you at the bar
on the first floor.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.369
Also, my man is in the lobby,

00:36.453 --> 00:38.705
so feel free to ask him
if you need anything.

00:40.790 --> 00:41.791
Okay, bye.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.381
I'm sorry.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.508
Isn't this place too fancy?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.677
Good food will give you energy.

00:52.761 --> 00:55.513
I'm sure your mother wants you
to feel better soon too.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.474
Let's not talk about that.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.933
Euijeong.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.727
When we were young,

01:02.020 --> 01:04.189
I ran away without saying anything.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.273
I'm sorry.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.150
Why did you do that?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.985
I didn't want to trouble you.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.032
The whole neighborhood
would've denounced us as murderers.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.747
Remember the dream
I talked about back then?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.082
Kind of.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.666
I've nearly realized it, right?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.045
How many businesses do you own again?

01:27.670 --> 01:32.383
Well, most of them are run
by my employees.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.010
If you combine them...

01:36.304 --> 01:37.430
A lot.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.891
How were you able to open
all of those businesses?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.019
You seemed to be working
with your old friends.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.479
Are they business partners?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.272
Or are they your employees?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.066
You have a lot of questions.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.197
I'm just curious how your life has been.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.034
I've been curious about you too.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.286
So your dream came true?

02:02.455 --> 02:03.915
I should keep my promise now.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.292
What promise?

02:44.247 --> 02:45.248
EUIJEONG: What's your dream?

02:45.665 --> 02:46.666
My dream?

02:47.625 --> 02:48.626
Being a nightclub owner?

02:49.836 --> 02:52.046
That's the most specific dream I've heard.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.090
Well, not just a nightclub.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.427
I want to open a restaurant and a cafe
next to the nightclub.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.181
And a movie theater, a Chinese restaurant,
a bar, and a Korean restaurant.

03:01.639 --> 03:05.059
So if anyone visits Gangnam,
they have to visit one of my stores.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.811
Then, nobody will look down on me.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.899
So like an "emperor of the night"?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.942
Emperor?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.444
I like that.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.738
If I become famous like that,

03:16.821 --> 03:19.699
I won't have to go
to a prestigious university to marry you.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.784
What are you saying?

03:22.785 --> 03:24.370
I'll have to become an emperor.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.040
I'll become an emperor and marry you.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.708
I promise.

03:38.968 --> 03:44.933
THE WORST OF EVIL

04:00.949 --> 04:02.075
Where are the Chinese?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.451
They're upstairs now.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.203
Any issues?

04:05.495 --> 04:06.496
No, Boss.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.122
(PHONE RINGING)

04:08.414 --> 04:09.624
Did you go somewhere, sir?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.045
Hello, Jung Gicheul speaking.

04:14.712 --> 04:15.713
I've arrived.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.992
Thank you for coming all this way.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.953
You can use this during your stay.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.455
(SNAPS FINGERS)

04:50.999 --> 04:52.667
(SOFTLY) Are you fucking serious?

05:17.233 --> 05:18.234
What's this?

05:18.609 --> 05:19.610
A gift for you.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.367
(SNICKERS)

05:27.243 --> 05:29.078
Professor Yoon was wearing this watch too.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.957
Is this how you handle things?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.168
(BAG THUDS)

05:40.340 --> 05:41.341
Man...

05:41.424 --> 05:43.343
You don't even have a fucking lighter?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.094
Hey.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.811
Considering all the loss we've incurred,

05:54.145 --> 05:56.481
from arranging the boat and sailors...

05:59.108 --> 06:01.277
Don't you at least owe me
a clock made of gold?

06:05.907 --> 06:07.241
I'll apologize once again.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.368
I'm sorry.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.827
It won't happen again.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.832
I should only work with those
who I can trust.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.962
That's what my father always said.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.549
If you continue to trade
with us like before,

06:24.467 --> 06:26.594
that trust will naturally be built again.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.097
Trust will naturally be built again?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.809
As they say here,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.103
dream on, Mr. Jung.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.650
What more can I do for you?

06:44.112 --> 06:47.490
Those Japanese must have
a lot of connections.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.120
I don't know how they did it,
but they called my father.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.916
They suggested
the three of us meet in Korea.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.459
That's why I'm here.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.715
But why meet in person
when we can talk on the phone?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.010
I think I know why.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.599
I'm tired. I'll get going.

07:15.768 --> 07:16.936
Haeryun.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.857
We want to raise our imports

07:21.566 --> 07:22.817
from 8kg to 10kg.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.613
We'll pay for the extra fee, not Japan.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.997
You've become very generous
after hearing the Japanese are coming,

07:36.080 --> 07:37.081
Mr. Jung.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.591
(IN MANDARIN)
It's too little, too late.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.223
(PHONE RINGING)

07:59.729 --> 08:01.022
-(IN KOREAN) This is Oyama.
-Hello.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.900
Meet me at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.443
Are you in Korea now?

08:07.195 --> 08:08.571
Did Father come too?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.782
I'll tell you the location tomorrow.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.662
(SIGHS)

08:20.166 --> 08:23.002
Mr. Murayama from Japan called me.

08:23.085 --> 08:27.798
He said one of the higher-ups
from Yoshioka-gumi's Yokohama branch

08:27.882 --> 08:30.593
is headed to Korea.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.762
His name is Oyama Tsuyoshi.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.932
He's also staying
at Grand Plaza Hotel in Gangnam

08:36.015 --> 08:37.850
like the Chinese.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.936
He's in Room 608.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.395
And the Chinese?

08:41.479 --> 08:43.564
Room 850 and 851.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.150
Maybe they're coming to discuss the attack

08:46.234 --> 08:47.985
that interrupted their trade.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.865
It'd be great if we could bug
all the hotel rooms.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.951
We can request the warrant later.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.247
The detectives and I will monitor
the CCTVs in the hotel corridors.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.917
Once we see them gather
in the same room or move somewhere,

09:03.000 --> 09:05.002
we'll start bugging each room.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.422
If Jung Gicheul meets them,

09:08.506 --> 09:11.008
it'd be perfect
if Detective Park can be there too.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.718
If that happens...

09:13.469 --> 09:15.012
Here.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.515
This bug can cover a 1km radius.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.434
Detective Park will be wearing this.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.645
I'll monitor the situation around him

09:22.770 --> 09:24.355
and record in real-time.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.439
Are we done now?

09:26.983 --> 09:28.276
I'll get going then.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.112
A triangle made of three countries.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.281
An international drug cartel!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.410
By the way, Mr. Cho,

09:39.245 --> 09:44.041
when can Inspector Yu stop
meeting with Jung Gicheul?

09:44.959 --> 09:48.588
Well, we don't want to do this either.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.757
But we can't just let her
disappear all of a sudden.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.428
Let's arrest them all
with all the evidence we collect this time

09:55.511 --> 09:56.887
and wrap this up quickly.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.271
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

10:15.990 --> 10:17.366
The name of the missing person?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.743
Cho Janghyun.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.996
But people call him Manager Cho.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.581
Manager of which company?

10:25.416 --> 10:26.584
Which was it?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.753
Our company.

10:31.255 --> 10:34.425
(BOTH LAUGH)

10:34.634 --> 10:36.302
When did you lose touch with him?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.596
-Well...
-So...

10:39.764 --> 10:42.266
That's not what happened.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.101
Was it last Monday?

10:44.727 --> 10:45.728
I don't know.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.521
Last Monday,

10:47.605 --> 10:50.566
he got kidnapped before our eyes.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.942
This is so frustrating.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.027
Kidnapped?

10:58.949 --> 11:00.159
Manager Cho, the drug dealer?

11:00.409 --> 11:01.410
-Yes.
-Yes.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.082
-Roll up your sleeves.
-What?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.291
Come on. Roll them up.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.003
Why is your arm so dirty?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.047
So you are Manager Cho's lackeys.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.131
Sorry?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.593
So Manager Cho...

11:19.470 --> 11:20.513
has been kidnapped?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.101
There's this thing called Gangnam Crystal.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.688
It's a type of meth
that's popular these days.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.106
Who's your boss?

11:30.940 --> 11:33.192
There's this drug dealer called Yankees,

11:33.275 --> 11:34.985
and we told him to bring his boss.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.947
So we brought this guy,
and three of them took Manager Cho.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.740
We need to catch this Yankees guy,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.492
but we don't know where to start,

11:41.575 --> 11:43.869
-and we don't...
-Hey!

11:43.953 --> 11:46.497
Are you high now? Why are you rambling?

11:46.872 --> 11:48.999
Tell me about this Yankees or whatever.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.084
And stop crying.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.713
We took him, beat him up,
and then asked him questions.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.047
-You mean Yankees?
-Yes.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.259
-And?
-And the names he told us

11:58.342 --> 12:00.052
were all fake.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.056
But we figured out
that he went to Yeoksam High.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
Yeoksam High.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.017
How?

12:07.101 --> 12:08.102
Tell me.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.311
How did you know that?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.149
It was in his pocket.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.320
A ticket from Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.573
And?

12:21.490 --> 12:22.825
That day, there was a game

12:23.617 --> 12:24.785
between Yeoksam High...

12:24.869 --> 12:25.995
And Gwangju Jeil High!

12:26.162 --> 12:28.247
(LAUGHING HEARTILY)

12:28.414 --> 12:29.790
-The game that day?
-BOTH: Yes.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.208
Yeoksam versus Gwangju Jeil?

12:31.292 --> 12:32.293
BOTH: Yes!

12:32.668 --> 12:34.170
-That's why Yeoksam High?
-BOTH: Yes.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.175
You God damn morons.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.094
We figured it out.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.805
Yeoksam High graduates
do have a close relationship

12:44.889 --> 12:46.223
-in Gangnam.
-BOTH: Yes.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.308
Right.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.700
(PHONE RINGING)

13:07.953 --> 13:08.954
Hello?

13:09.038 --> 13:10.915
Come to Grand Plaza Hotel.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.542
Bring the Chinese too.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.669
Okay. I'll come with them.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.256
I'll tell you later where in the hotel.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.383
Can I come with my men?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.677
Bring just one bodyguard.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.060
Kwon Seungho.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.312
Yes, Boss?

13:33.395 --> 13:34.396
Come with me.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.899
The rest will wait in front of the hotel.

13:36.982 --> 13:37.983
Discreetly.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.918
(THUMPS CAR)

13:56.001 --> 13:57.711
What the fuck?

13:58.379 --> 14:00.130
(HONKS HORN) Hey, move!

14:01.006 --> 14:02.675
You fucker.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.010
Where are you going in such a hurry?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.679
You almost hit him.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.973
-I'm sorry, sir.
-You almost hit him.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.434
Fucking Mercedes snob.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.811
Get out of the car.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.104
-This fucking...
-Come on.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.773
Get out. I'm a cop.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.277
What a moron.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.031
Drive better, you bastard.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.577
Hey, Mr. Jung. It's been a while.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.828
Hang on.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.912
Damn, my back hurts.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.164
Get out. I want to talk to you.

14:34.498 --> 14:37.334
What the fuck?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.295
Hey.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.422
What in the world are you doing?

14:41.505 --> 14:42.631
Do you have a warrant?

14:42.798 --> 14:46.719
Where did you learn about warrants?

14:46.802 --> 14:48.721
I said do you have a fucking warrant?

14:49.179 --> 14:50.472

It seems that punk offed
this dealer called Manager Cho.

So I wanted to talk to him,
but I can't seem to locate him.

in the nightlife business in Gangnam.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.223
What brings you here?

15:33.307 --> 15:34.600
Have you been well, Detective?

15:34.683 --> 15:35.976
Hey, Jungbae.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.103
No, because of you fuckers.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.231
Jungbae, Heesung.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.484
-Yes?
-Do you know Yankees?

15:43.901 --> 15:45.694
What? Yankees?

15:45.778 --> 15:47.529
No, we've never heard of him. (LAUGHS)

15:47.613 --> 15:50.824
Fuck, how could you not know him?
He went to your school.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.786
From Yeoksam High School,
the crappiest school in history.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.206
I know you thugs look after your alumni.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.832
Come on, Detective.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.044
There were 12 classes
for one grade in our school. (LAUGHS)

16:02.127 --> 16:04.838
And over 50 students in each.
So how should we know?

16:05.547 --> 16:09.259
Well, I can shake you guys down
to see if that's true.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.719

Hey, Jung Gicheul.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.732
If your lackey Yankees
really did off Manager Cho,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.401
this won't be a drug crime.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.319
It'll be a violent crime.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.238
What do you think that means?

16:32.741 --> 16:34.743
It means you might have to see me often.

16:36.745 --> 16:37.746
I'll see you around.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.202
Get going.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.204
No need to see me off.

17:27.921 --> 17:31.050
Sir, just because you mentioned
this Yankees guy

17:31.133 --> 17:33.552
doesn't mean they'll go straight to him.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.512
What's the point of following them?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.140
Well, we had nothing to do anyway.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.224
Are you busy?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
Let's follow them just for today.

before going in.

found out about that.

36:14.755 --> 36:15.756
Korean?

36:16.883 --> 36:19.135
Your boss speaks fluent Korean though.

36:23.806 --> 36:27.685
Does he understand me or not? (SIGHS)

36:29.020 --> 36:31.814
Why are the guys here so quiet?

36:38.237 --> 36:40.239
Are you still using matches?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.950
Are you from the Qing Dynasty or what?

36:45.494 --> 36:47.163
Here. Take this.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.290
It's my gift for you. Take it.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.854
The police are here.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.815
There's a cop coming.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.943
I'll handle things over there.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.486
Take the people inside and run...

37:18.569 --> 37:19.779
Hey!

37:22.823 --> 37:25.576
I said the police are here. Understand?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.578
Take them and run. Now.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.791
Detective.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.418
What brings you here?

37:34.502 --> 37:35.753
What do you think?

37:36.420 --> 37:37.797
I told you we'd meet again.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.216
What's Jung Gicheul doing in there?

37:42.677 --> 37:44.220
He's doing some business.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.473
Business, my fucking ass. Move.

37:48.849 --> 37:49.850
I said move.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.352
You hear me?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.106
Stop looking at me and move.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.566
-Hey.
-I'm sorry.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.735
Have you lost your mind? Move.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.113
Hey, Mr. Jung!

38:02.738 --> 38:05.866
Jung Gicheul!

38:05.950 --> 38:07.910
There you are.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.830
Hey, Mr. Jung!

38:10.913 --> 38:12.665
Jung Gicheul, come here.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.334
Mr. Jung. Hey!

38:15.418 --> 38:17.962
-Let's go finish our talk.
-MINGOO: What were you doing?

38:18.045 --> 38:19.547
Were you all playing poker?

38:19.839 --> 38:20.840
Come here!

38:20.923 --> 38:22.091
Stop!

38:22.174 --> 38:24.635
Stop right there, you bastard!

38:25.720 --> 38:27.263
Have you lost your damn mind?

38:30.766 --> 38:32.601
Come on, Detective.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.520
-Don't be like this.
-Did you hit me?

38:34.603 --> 38:35.896
Did you just hit me?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.159
(GROANS)

38:52.079 --> 38:53.664
Come here, you bastard.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.436
(GROWLS)

39:25.863 --> 39:28.574
Mr. Jung, does this mean
our trade is over now?

39:30.993 --> 39:31.994
(SCOFFS)

39:32.078 --> 39:33.954
(IN MANDARIN) I guess it really is.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.541
It looks like he has
great trust in his man.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.340
(IN KOREAN)
Go help Mr. Jung's man up there.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.175
Let's go.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.682
Detectives. To the 12th floor.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.102
-Where are they?
-Here.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.064
-We found them.
-Arrest him.

40:00.147 --> 40:01.565
Which one of the two?

40:01.649 --> 40:03.484
Who the hell are you?

40:03.901 --> 40:05.778
-The bigger one.
-Okay.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.696
-Do you have a death wish?
-Fuck off.

40:07.780 --> 40:09.031
Motherfucker.

40:09.115 --> 40:10.825
-Freeze!
-What are you doing?

40:10.908 --> 40:11.909
Who are you?

40:11.992 --> 40:13.202
You're under arrest.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.704
-Let go of me, you bastards!
-Stop moving!

40:15.788 --> 40:19.458
I'm a cop, you fuckers!

40:20.459 --> 40:23.337
I'm a real fucking cop, for God's sake!

40:23.421 --> 40:25.464
You motherfuckers!

40:25.548 --> 40:26.674
For fuck's sake!

40:33.889 --> 40:36.225
Captain, he really is a cop.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.435
A cop?

40:37.726 --> 40:39.353
What about the other guy?

40:39.437 --> 40:40.438
He ran away.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.066
Pull out now.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.451
(EXHALES)

40:59.457 --> 41:04.587
Damn it. Those God damn fuckers!

41:07.006 --> 41:08.007
Are you okay?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.633
Yes, I'm okay.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.136
Let's get out when things quiet down.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.554
Yes, Boss.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.745
MAN 1: That fucking pig!

41:37.828 --> 41:39.914
MAN 2: You should bribe him or something.

41:39.997 --> 41:41.457
God damn it.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.764
It would've been okay to let the cop in.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.603
Just talking isn't illegal.

42:02.686 --> 42:05.272
That cop would've found
something on us somehow.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.191
Also, that passport of yours...

42:09.401 --> 42:10.778
Isn't it forged?

42:12.446 --> 42:13.989
So you were protecting me?

42:15.366 --> 42:18.202
From getting arrested?
(DISPARAGING SIGH)

42:22.081 --> 42:24.041
It seems you had a pretty wild scuffle.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.548
Doesn't that mean
things will get more serious?

42:31.799 --> 42:34.969
You have quite the talent
for making things worse.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.434
Mr. Jung, you have
a wild way of doing business.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.021
But it's too dangerous to work with.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.232
I got this wound recently.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.858
And it's minor.

42:49.984 --> 42:50.985
And until now,

42:51.068 --> 42:54.154
we've never had any issues
caused by this kind of matter.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.573
I can guarantee you that.

42:55.656 --> 42:56.657
I see.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.120
So this isn't even an issue to you?

43:04.081 --> 43:07.209
Could you at least do something
about the wound on your back?

43:07.918 --> 43:10.170
People might think
someone's dead and call the police.

43:12.798 --> 43:13.924
(IN MANDARIN) Come here.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.308
Treat his wound.

43:24.476 --> 43:27.104
He risked his life to take responsibility,

43:27.354 --> 43:29.857
which isn't a bad quality
for a business partner.

43:32.318 --> 43:34.945
(IN KOREAN) Gosh, you're so annoying!

43:35.029 --> 43:38.198
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

43:38.282 --> 43:41.327
From Room 1203,

43:41.410 --> 43:44.038
a God damn parade of people came out.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.289
Both men and women.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.707
And the room was huge as hell!

43:46.790 --> 43:49.376
It doesn't make sense that
nobody reserved the room!

43:49.460 --> 43:52.838
There was no reservation made
for Room 1203 today.

43:53.088 --> 43:54.673
Then, who were those people?

43:54.757 --> 43:55.841
Ghosts?

43:57.009 --> 43:59.637
Hey, lady. You better tell me the truth.

44:00.346 --> 44:02.473
Or you'll be tagged
with a criminal record.

44:02.556 --> 44:03.599
Show me the register.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.726
You think I'm joking?

44:05.809 --> 44:07.019
Sir.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.563
-I looked for them.
-And?

44:09.647 --> 44:10.898
I can't find anyone.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.776
God damn it.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.486
Let's go then.

44:37.424 --> 44:41.679
The Japanese proposed
that we use a different Korean carrier.

44:44.348 --> 44:48.143
And they offered to pay me
15% more than what you do.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.188
We'll pay double the price

44:51.814 --> 44:53.691
that we used to pay per kilogram.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.656
Money is not the problem here.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.078
What are you going to do
to regain my trust?

45:12.084 --> 45:15.713
Of course, trading with someone new
would be a hard decision for us too.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.840
What should we do?

45:27.683 --> 45:30.602
You have a good man
who is willing to give up

45:31.353 --> 45:33.021
everything for you.

45:34.273 --> 45:37.609
I heard Korea's government
was pretty powerful too.

45:38.652 --> 45:40.946
Now that the police are involved,

45:41.029 --> 45:42.781
let's see how it goes.

45:50.622 --> 45:53.000
Why are you going
to such lengths for this?

46:02.468 --> 46:06.764
Because I trust my boss.

46:09.683 --> 46:12.686
You value trust too, don't you?

46:14.062 --> 46:17.065
We're the same.
Trust is our number one priority.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.904
Especially in this deal.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.157
(IN MANDARIN) What do you think

46:26.116 --> 46:27.242
of that crazy man?

46:30.120 --> 46:31.371
He seems loyal.

46:36.752 --> 46:38.045
Looks like a good guy.

46:38.128 --> 46:39.129
Hmm.

46:51.099 --> 46:52.684
(IN KOREAN) Hello.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.520
I'd like to call Room 608.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.732
-OYAMA: (IN JAPANESE) Hello?
-(IN KOREAN) This is Miss Lee.

46:58.982 --> 46:59.983
Hello.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.570
Must I decide today?

47:19.086 --> 47:20.838
I'll take a few more days to think.

47:39.022 --> 47:40.858
It's been a while
since I've visited Korea.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.153
I should do some sightseeing.

47:49.366 --> 47:50.951
And check out the real estate.

47:52.536 --> 47:55.998
I should probably stop
secretly taking money into China.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.500
I might as well invest it here.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.006
I'll need a tour guide.

48:09.219 --> 48:10.470
I guess you can't, right?

48:12.264 --> 48:14.725
You hit a cop, so you should stay low.

48:21.106 --> 48:22.524
(PHONE RINGING)

48:23.775 --> 48:24.776
Hello?

48:25.819 --> 48:27.821
OYAMA: Are you with Miss Lee?

48:29.448 --> 48:30.699
Yes, I am.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.375
Miss Lee.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.587
You're one impatient man.

48:43.670 --> 48:45.297
I didn't expect you to call already.

48:45.631 --> 48:47.799
The boss has delivered

48:48.342 --> 48:49.676
his message.

48:50.260 --> 48:53.889
He says he'll be okay
with whatever decision you make.

48:54.222 --> 48:57.643
However, regardless of the decision,

48:58.352 --> 49:03.023
he wants this trade to stop
for the time being.

49:03.106 --> 49:07.277
And since the police
interrupted our meeting,

49:07.361 --> 49:08.695
he is furious.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.614
That cop didn't come because of this.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.532
Whatever the reason was,

49:12.824 --> 49:16.203
he came because of you, didn't he?

49:16.411 --> 49:19.790
Only when everything feels safe again,

49:20.749 --> 49:23.293
he will reopen the trade.

49:23.752 --> 49:24.962
Miss Lee.

49:25.462 --> 49:28.382
I hope you make a wise decision.

49:32.427 --> 49:36.723
God damn it! (SIGHS WITH FRUSTRATION)

49:45.816 --> 49:47.567
Mr. Jung, can we talk?

50:19.307 --> 50:22.019
Without customers,
there's no point in production.

50:24.479 --> 50:27.232
That's going to play
the biggest role in my decision.

50:30.819 --> 50:32.320
What can I do to help you?

50:32.487 --> 50:34.031
There's nothing you can do right now.

50:36.408 --> 50:40.704
Your Japanese father is acting
like he's the king.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.970
Assaulting a police officer
and obstruction of justice.

51:00.182 --> 51:03.018
So you'll get out of prison
when your hair's gray?

51:04.644 --> 51:07.647
Well, I'll see you with gray hair then.

51:11.026 --> 51:13.320
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

51:13.570 --> 51:14.863
If things work out...

51:15.864 --> 51:18.033
I'd like you to be my tour guide.

51:29.544 --> 51:31.421
MAN 1: Odds.
MAN 2: Damn it.

51:32.172 --> 51:33.465
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

51:44.935 --> 51:46.228
Who are you?

51:46.311 --> 51:47.854
How may I help you?

51:47.938 --> 51:49.106
We're the police.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.361
Jung Gicheul is back, right?

51:58.532 --> 52:00.450
Gicheul!

52:00.534 --> 52:02.244
Come on out while I'm being nice.

52:04.287 --> 52:05.372
What the fuck?

52:05.455 --> 52:07.624
Sir!

52:07.749 --> 52:09.626
Fuck, what is it?

52:09.709 --> 52:11.294
Could you come check the CCTV?

52:11.545 --> 52:13.922
If you're going to investigate,
bring a warrant.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.299
As I always say,

52:17.217 --> 52:19.386
these underling pricks never listen.

52:27.227 --> 52:28.812
Damn, these motherfuckers.

52:29.187 --> 52:30.647
They're coming.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.065
-Did you lock the door?
-What?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.651
-The door.
-Go lock the door, you fuck!

52:40.365 --> 52:41.658
"Gangnam Industry"?

52:42.117 --> 52:43.535
You have to be fucking kidding me.

52:47.747 --> 52:50.083
Open up. This is the police.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.589
We're the police. Open up!

52:55.672 --> 52:57.841
Sir, what should we do?

52:58.049 --> 52:59.676
Did we commit a fucking crime?

52:59.759 --> 53:00.760
-I'm sorry.
-Did we?

53:00.844 --> 53:02.179
Step aside.

53:02.929 --> 53:03.972
Bastards.

Hey!

53:07.100 --> 53:08.518
You're not going to open up?

53:10.562 --> 53:13.273
I'll give you three seconds.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.527
Three.

Two!

some manual labor.

54:12.374 --> 54:16.419
Just because you're a cop,
it doesn't mean you can act like this.

Shit.

54:23.385 --> 54:25.762
A cop can act like this, you motherfucker.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.138
What the...

54:27.222 --> 54:29.015
Stop, you damn thugs.

54:30.225 --> 54:33.561
Get back. Make a line.

54:33.645 --> 54:37.065
-God damn it.
-I said make a line! Move!

54:38.566 --> 54:39.734
Where's Jung Gicheul?

54:40.151 --> 54:42.112
I said he's not here.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.114
(MALLET CLATTERS TO GROUND)

54:45.073 --> 54:46.866
Then, call him.

54:46.950 --> 54:48.827
We don't know where he went.

54:52.914 --> 54:55.500
Call his cellphone, you fuck.

54:55.667 --> 54:58.670
He didn't tell us his phone number. Okay?

54:59.879 --> 55:00.922
What the fuck?

55:02.590 --> 55:03.633
He didn't...

55:03.717 --> 55:04.718
tell you...

55:04.801 --> 55:06.511
his phone number?

55:06.594 --> 55:08.346
So does that mean...

55:08.430 --> 55:10.598
you deserve a lot of hits?

55:10.682 --> 55:11.766
You fuck!

55:11.850 --> 55:13.268
You deserve to be hit?

55:13.351 --> 55:15.437
A whole fucking ton?

55:15.520 --> 55:16.813
Is that what you mean?

55:16.896 --> 55:18.189
Is it, you motherfucker?

55:21.318 --> 55:22.319
(COUGHS)

55:22.569 --> 55:23.653
Hey!

55:24.404 --> 55:27.032
I guess you don't know
his number either. Right?

55:28.616 --> 55:29.868
I will...

55:32.454 --> 55:34.164
help you remember.

55:34.581 --> 55:35.623
JUNGBAE: Okay.

55:36.374 --> 55:37.375
Got it.

55:39.919 --> 55:42.964
They destroyed our office and left.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.508
-What do we do?
-God damn it.

55:45.592 --> 55:47.969
Of all people, it's that fucking lunatic
Hwang Mingoo.

55:49.220 --> 55:50.263
Chief Seo.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.931
Call all of our emergency contacts.

55:52.015 --> 55:54.225
Tell them to close the stores and lie low.

55:54.642 --> 55:55.769
All of the stores?

55:56.811 --> 55:58.855
Just do as I say, you bastard.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.357
I'll turn myself in.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.068
GICHEUL: What?

56:03.151 --> 56:05.945
Somebody has to step up to resolve this.

56:06.571 --> 56:08.073
I caused this,

56:08.448 --> 56:10.450
so I'll take care of it
one way or another.

56:18.083 --> 56:19.376
Hey, Kwon Seungho.

56:19.459 --> 56:20.877
You bastard.

56:22.003 --> 56:24.881
You think I'll just let you go to prison?

56:25.298 --> 56:26.299
Boss.

56:27.258 --> 56:28.760
I'll go take care of things

56:28.843 --> 56:30.970
so nothing bad happens
to you or the company.

56:36.267 --> 56:37.310
In return...

56:41.106 --> 56:42.774
if I manage to work things out,

56:45.985 --> 56:47.612
I have a favor to ask of you.

56:53.743 --> 56:56.204
The trade with Japan and China.

56:57.247 --> 56:58.957
Let me join it.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.337
I'll go and take care of this then.

57:11.010 --> 57:13.805
Hurry up and give me
an answer, you bastard.
