01:51.942 --> 01:53.211
<i>OX-2 is in the air.</i>

01:53.311 --> 01:56.214
<i>I repeat, OX-2 is in the air.</i>

02:06.023 --> 02:09.294
-Hostages...
where are they?

02:11.630 --> 02:13.698
-Where are they,
you asshole?

02:15.866 --> 02:18.236
<i>Approaching target,</i>
<i>T minus 30 seconds.</i>

02:18.336 --> 02:19.271
-Affirmative.

02:20.472 --> 02:22.173
It's time to get down,
sir.

02:22.274 --> 02:23.241
Two minutes.

02:24.743 --> 02:26.244
Sir, we need to go.

02:27.412 --> 02:29.514
-You go.

02:29.614 --> 02:31.882
Fall back.
I said fall back!

02:35.453 --> 02:38.022
Where are they?

02:38.122 --> 02:41.259
I will never tell you.

02:46.531 --> 02:48.266
-Don't make me ask again.

02:48.366 --> 02:50.168
You're never gonna find them.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.208
Go on.

02:57.309 --> 03:00.445
Do it. Do it.

03:00.545 --> 03:02.547
Do it, you want to do it.

03:02.647 --> 03:03.847
Do it.

03:13.224 --> 03:14.091
<i>Firing on order.</i>

03:14.192 --> 03:17.662
Please confirm. Confirm, over.

05:18.048 --> 05:20.552
Hello, boss.

05:20.652 --> 05:21.553
All right? All right?

05:21.653 --> 05:22.554
-Nice to see you, buddy.

05:22.654 --> 05:23.588
-You look great, boss.

05:23.688 --> 05:24.722
-Take it easy
with that stuff.

05:24.823 --> 05:25.857
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.024
-What have we
got in there?

05:27.124 --> 05:29.327
-In the bag here, two mil, boss.

05:29.427 --> 05:30.328
-Two mil?

05:30.428 --> 05:31.229
-Two mil.

05:31.329 --> 05:32.630
-That's good week.
-Good week.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.898
-What else?

05:33.997 --> 05:36.534
-Andre here
has something to show you.

05:36.634 --> 05:37.869
Honestly, what?

05:37.968 --> 05:38.903
Savo?

05:39.002 --> 05:40.138
-See that, boss.

06:07.365 --> 06:08.900
-Fresh in this mornin', boss.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.502
-They look fresh to you, Andre?

06:13.571 --> 06:14.472
-No, they don't.
-No, no.

06:14.572 --> 06:16.073
That's the right answer.

06:16.174 --> 06:18.075
-Maybe that one over there.

06:18.176 --> 06:20.010
-Get serious,
would you, mate?

06:20.110 --> 06:21.546
For fuck's sake,
this is my business

06:21.646 --> 06:22.847
we're talking about, right?

06:22.947 --> 06:25.048
Clean 'em up!

06:25.149 --> 06:26.484
Fuckin' hose 'em down,
do whatever you want.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.353
Just make sure they look good
for the whorehouse tomorrow.

06:28.453 --> 06:30.588
Very simple. Do you think
you can do that?

06:30.688 --> 06:32.490
-Yeah.
-Go on.

06:34.024 --> 06:35.226
-Benny.

06:38.296 --> 06:39.464
Did you get it sorted?

06:39.564 --> 06:40.765
-It's done, guv.

06:40.865 --> 06:41.766
-Lead the way.

06:44.101 --> 06:45.803
All right, all right.

06:48.406 --> 06:50.040
One out of the gate.
Come on.

06:50.141 --> 06:51.376
All right, now. Come on.

06:55.078 --> 06:56.214
Come on.

07:27.145 --> 07:28.780
Oh, fuck you.

07:28.880 --> 07:29.881
-I fuckin' warned you.

07:29.981 --> 07:31.382
I told you exactly
what would happen

07:31.482 --> 07:34.686
if you kept doing business
in my territory, right?

07:34.786 --> 07:37.155
Now you see, the difference
between me and you

07:37.255 --> 07:39.424
is that my business wallet
is expanding.

07:39.524 --> 07:42.994
Whereas yours, well,
your patch is getting smaller.

07:43.093 --> 07:44.362
So, ultimately,
you're gonna end up

07:44.462 --> 07:47.799
doing business in my territory.
So, you know what?

07:47.899 --> 07:49.067
-What?

07:49.167 --> 07:50.935
-I think it's time
you got the fuck out of my city,

07:51.035 --> 07:52.270
that's what.

07:52.370 --> 07:56.541
-Your city?
You're fucking 40, you cunt.

08:01.012 --> 08:04.048
-Well, I was.
Not anymore.

08:04.182 --> 08:08.286
Now, you do not know
how fucking lucky you are

08:08.386 --> 08:09.954
I'm gonna let you live.

08:10.054 --> 08:11.356
You see, I need to
send a message

08:11.456 --> 08:14.192
to those ponce pricks
that work for you.

08:14.292 --> 08:15.627
Now listen to this
very carefully,

08:15.727 --> 08:16.961
you fucking idiot.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.329
The message is,

08:18.429 --> 08:21.966
you sell one gram of cocaine
in my territory again,

08:22.066 --> 08:24.235
and I will cut
all your fucking heads off

08:24.335 --> 08:26.571
and send them
to those closest to you.

08:26.671 --> 08:29.173
Oh, I hope
you understand that, mate.

08:31.442 --> 08:33.044
-Prick.

08:33.144 --> 08:34.846
-That'll be the last time
you ever do that.

08:34.946 --> 08:36.781
Send him to the red room,
will you?

08:46.591 --> 08:47.959
-Major Carver.

08:48.059 --> 08:50.094
-It's good to see you, kid.

08:50.194 --> 08:51.562
You know,
one of the guys told me

08:51.663 --> 08:53.564
you were hanging here
at the park.

08:55.066 --> 08:57.235
-Yeah, I--
sorry I stopped coming

08:57.335 --> 09:00.204
to the sessions, sir.
I was preoccupied.

09:00.304 --> 09:02.073
-Oh, well, forget that.

09:02.173 --> 09:04.175
You know, just don't
make a habit of it.

09:04.275 --> 09:06.811
The guys, they were just getting
used to you.

09:06.911 --> 09:08.513
What's with the bag?

09:10.748 --> 09:12.383
That's nothing.

09:14.218 --> 09:15.787
-Be straight with me, kid.

09:15.887 --> 09:18.189
Where are you staying?

09:18.289 --> 09:20.491
-I'm in between places
right now.

09:20.591 --> 09:25.430
-Well, I've got
a spare room at my place.

09:25.530 --> 09:28.933
It's got a cot
and some drawers and--

09:29.033 --> 09:33.471
well, it's basic, but it's yours
as long as you need it.

09:33.571 --> 09:37.442
And I have some spare shirts.
Use anything you like.

09:39.210 --> 09:40.478
-I couldn't do that, sir.

09:40.578 --> 09:42.847
-Oh, yes, you can,
and you will.

09:42.947 --> 09:44.749
You know, your old man
would have done the same thing

09:44.849 --> 09:47.186
for my little Judy
if she needed help.

09:47.285 --> 09:50.621
Besides, I'm--I'm not there
much anymore lately.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.391
-With a lady friend,
have we, sir?

09:53.491 --> 09:56.961
-No, no.
I'm staying at Judy's, you know.

09:57.061 --> 10:02.066
It's, uh, personal stuff.
You know, father-daughter stuff.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.501
-Anything I can do?

10:03.601 --> 10:06.637
-What you can do for me
is learn how to accept help.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.774
And maybe a shave and a haircut.
What do you say?

10:09.874 --> 10:12.076
Come on, let's go and
we'll get you a meeting after.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.978
Come on.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.170
-So, I hear you like to
play golf, am I right, mate?

10:38.269 --> 10:40.239
-Looks like
a good golfer, guv.

10:40.338 --> 10:42.273
Might as well
fucking handicap him.

10:46.010 --> 10:46.944
-Fore.

10:52.583 --> 10:53.651
-Jesus.

10:53.751 --> 10:55.620
Cauterize the fucking hand,
take him back to the club

10:55.720 --> 10:58.890
and make sure
everyone sees him, right?

11:01.292 --> 11:02.426
Fuck.

11:13.337 --> 11:15.373
-Hey, you look
a hell of a lot better.

11:15.473 --> 11:17.074
You ready for the meeting?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.043
-I'm as ready
as I'll ever be.

11:19.144 --> 11:20.044
-Let's do it.

11:21.679 --> 11:22.814
-Let's do it.

12:13.298 --> 12:15.300
-Hey!

12:15.399 --> 12:16.901
- Come in,.
Come on, brother.

12:19.003 --> 12:20.205
Look what I found.

12:20.305 --> 12:21.706
- Hi, sir.
- How you doing?

12:21.806 --> 12:22.974
- Been a while.
- You all right?

12:23.074 --> 12:24.408
-Let's go, guys, come on.

12:34.685 --> 12:36.754
-Do me a favor--
retire that little prick anyway,

12:36.854 --> 12:38.522
we need to
send a message, right?

12:38.623 --> 12:39.724
-It's done.
-Okay.

12:39.824 --> 12:41.092
-I'll call Savo.

12:43.561 --> 12:46.631
-And when I came out
of the war, Barbara was there.

12:46.731 --> 12:50.601
When we were up to our necks
in blood and mud,

12:50.701 --> 12:54.538
she had this knack
of steering me away from the--

12:54.639 --> 12:59.244
the bad thoughts and the--
the darkness, you know.

12:59.344 --> 13:02.113
And she--she brought me
into the hope.

13:03.714 --> 13:06.751
Sorry, you've--
you've heard all this before.

13:08.586 --> 13:09.620
-It's all right, Harris.

13:09.720 --> 13:10.821
That's the whole point
of this, isn't it?

13:10.922 --> 13:13.392
We talk about it.
We bring it out in the open

13:13.491 --> 13:15.660
even if we have been
through it all before.

13:19.430 --> 13:22.767
-You know,
me, Peck and Woody,

13:22.867 --> 13:25.803
we were in the same unit
together, you know.

13:25.903 --> 13:29.274
We had a few friends
that we lost along the way.

13:29.374 --> 13:32.777
Three of the guys that were
with us, they shot themselves.

13:35.646 --> 13:39.384
-Yeah, I came back after
a few years of mercenary work.

13:39.483 --> 13:40.451
And as we all know,
there's nothing like

13:40.551 --> 13:42.387
mercenary work to fuck you up.

13:42.486 --> 13:44.789
I came very close to

13:44.889 --> 13:46.924
myself
a few times.

13:48.393 --> 13:49.794
Anyway, then one day,
I walk into a pub,

13:49.894 --> 13:51.662
not this one,
it was a real shithole,

13:51.762 --> 13:53.931
and there's old Woody sitting
all by himself,

13:54.031 --> 13:56.301
really morose he was.

13:56.401 --> 13:57.369
And he was sitting right beside

13:57.468 --> 13:59.904
a whole line of
empty pint glasses.

14:00.004 --> 14:01.639
-Don't forget the shots.

14:01.739 --> 14:03.975
-Yeah, you were
a soggy mess, my friend.

14:04.075 --> 14:06.477
Anyway, that's when
I realized he needed me;

14:06.577 --> 14:08.347
we all needed each other.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.613
So, I bought this place

14:09.714 --> 14:11.949
and then we hooked up
with Carver and Harris,

14:12.049 --> 14:14.719
and here we all are.

14:14.819 --> 14:17.322
The point being is that
you don't leave a man behind

14:17.422 --> 14:19.757
even when the war is over
and done with.

14:19.857 --> 14:22.860
-You know, these guys,
they helped me face the past

14:22.960 --> 14:25.997
because we faced the pain
as a unit.

14:26.097 --> 14:27.765
And it's because of
these boys over here

14:27.865 --> 14:29.934
that I could become
a good father.

15:43.308 --> 15:44.708
-Who the fuck are you?

15:44.809 --> 15:45.876
-Does Nate live here?

15:45.976 --> 15:48.380
-No. Fuck off.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.948
-Are you sure
Nate doesn't live here?

15:51.048 --> 15:52.049
-No.

15:52.150 --> 15:54.519
Ground floor,
door number three, gray door.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.161
Wait!

16:41.632 --> 16:42.900
- Shots fired
at Towers,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.034
shots fired!

16:44.136 --> 16:46.036
Send an armed unit
and an ambulance immediately.

17:19.937 --> 17:21.273
The apartment is clear.

17:22.607 --> 17:23.807
Nate is dead.

17:23.908 --> 17:25.075
<i>I'm coming.</i>

17:42.627 --> 17:43.961
-So, now, Mr. Burton,

17:44.061 --> 17:46.764
do you feel like sharing
anything with us today?

17:48.433 --> 17:49.700
-Well--

17:49.800 --> 17:51.068
-Yeah,
we're here to listen, kid.

17:51.169 --> 17:52.604
Come on.

17:52.703 --> 17:54.406
-Three-seven-two-eight
Rifleman Burton,

17:54.506 --> 17:58.343
Warrant Officer, Royal Green
Jackets Second Battalion.

17:58.443 --> 18:02.280
I--well,...

18:05.584 --> 18:07.851
I've been having nightmares.

18:11.021 --> 18:12.557
So, they're not nightmares,
are they.

18:12.657 --> 18:15.393
They're memories,
they're flashbacks,

18:15.493 --> 18:17.728
and they are so fucking real.

18:21.666 --> 18:28.540
I joined up from school,
you know, father's footsteps.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.544
Operation Desert Shield,
an arcade game.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.946
And Bosnia, that--
that wasn't a game.

18:36.947 --> 18:44.522
Went to Iraq... Afghanistan...
Yemen.

18:47.592 --> 18:54.366
You-- you see things, you know,
you do things and...

18:54.466 --> 18:56.201
they cut you to the bone.

18:59.137 --> 19:02.340
But you wanna finish the tour,
so you bury 'em.

19:03.974 --> 19:08.179
You bury 'em and you think
you've conquered them.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.349
But only while you're awake...

19:22.227 --> 19:23.428
...you see things.

19:27.332 --> 19:34.205
And the memories, you know,
they're so--it's so clear.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.174
It's so real.

19:38.075 --> 19:40.412
And then, the good memories,

19:40.512 --> 19:42.147
the ones that had nothing to do
with the war,

19:42.247 --> 19:45.550
they just get more distant,
more faded.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.255
And the next thing you know,

19:50.355 --> 19:54.192
you're sleeping
on a cemetery bench

19:54.292 --> 19:57.928
near your dad's grave,
trying to work out why it is

19:58.028 --> 20:03.335
every time you close your eyes
there's a fucking horror show.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.005
-I think it's time
for a pint.

20:08.105 --> 20:11.075
-Yup.
-Whose turn is it though?

20:12.777 --> 20:14.512
-Oh, yeah.

20:14.612 --> 20:15.747
-Oh, please.

20:15.846 --> 20:16.715
No, what do you mean,
please?

20:16.815 --> 20:17.749
-Give it a rest, camel.

20:17.848 --> 20:19.517
-Get your hands
in those pockets.

20:19.617 --> 20:22.354
Come on. No, man. Please.
-No, no.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.322
-He never wants
a fucking drink ever.

20:32.096 --> 20:35.200
-Well, how did you
find the session today?

20:35.300 --> 20:38.803
-I feel a weight
was lifted by sharing.

20:38.902 --> 20:41.905
-Yeah, well, it's not
a cure, but it's a start.

20:42.005 --> 20:42.906
Things will get better.

20:43.006 --> 20:43.941
-You want another pint?

20:44.041 --> 20:45.943
-No, no, no.
I gotta go, kid.

20:46.043 --> 20:47.878
I gotta help my daughter
with something.

20:47.978 --> 20:50.415
Here, you take the key,
make yourself at home

20:50.515 --> 20:53.251
and I'll check in with you
in a couple of days, okay?

20:56.554 --> 20:57.655
-Thank you, Major Carver.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.292
Thank you.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.460
-You bet.

21:24.081 --> 21:25.417
-Oh, hello, salad squeezer.

21:28.051 --> 21:29.953
Oy. We're closed, mate.

21:30.053 --> 21:31.689
-Yeah, well,
I'm just here to see your boss.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.724
-Didn't you
fucking hear me, mate?

21:32.824 --> 21:34.091
We're closed.

21:34.192 --> 21:35.058
You know, I don't think

21:35.160 --> 21:36.861
I like your manner, buddy.

21:36.960 --> 21:40.398
You know, I used to work a door,
but we kept order,

21:40.498 --> 21:42.367
but we were polite.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.401
And you know what else?

21:43.501 --> 21:44.736
-What?

21:44.836 --> 21:48.840
-We used to wear a tie. We
presented ourselves properly.

21:48.939 --> 21:50.909
You do know where a tie goes,
right?

21:51.008 --> 21:52.744
-'Round your fucking neck.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.046
-You're right.

22:13.565 --> 22:15.467
-Who the fuck are you?

22:15.567 --> 22:16.801
-Are you the owner?

22:16.901 --> 22:18.436
-Yeah.

22:18.536 --> 22:20.872
How the hell did you
get in here anyway?

22:20.971 --> 22:22.973
-Oh, it's okay.
I showed Marcus my ID.

22:23.073 --> 22:24.709
I'm over 21.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.015
-So, what do you want?

22:32.115 --> 22:33.852
-I just want
a little chat with you.

22:33.952 --> 22:36.488
-Chat? About what?

22:36.588 --> 22:38.756
-It seems that
there's a local councilor

22:38.857 --> 22:41.326
that you guys are intimidating.

22:41.426 --> 22:44.896
-So, what the
fuck has it got to do with you?

22:44.995 --> 22:47.030
-Well, I voted for her.

22:47.130 --> 22:49.334
Call me a concerned
senior citizen.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.504
I'm asking you guys politely
to stop intimidating her

22:52.604 --> 22:55.640
and maybe be just
a little bit more discreet

22:55.740 --> 22:57.542
in the operation you run.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.277
-Operation?

22:59.377 --> 23:02.380
-You guys aren't
too subtle in your dealings.

23:02.480 --> 23:07.117
Now, she may not go to
the police, but someone will.

23:07.218 --> 23:10.922
-And I suppose
that someone would be you?

23:11.021 --> 23:12.991
-Not my style, buddy.

23:13.090 --> 23:17.228
-And what
exactly is your style, buddy?

23:17.328 --> 23:19.898
-I'd rather you
not have to find out.

23:19.998 --> 23:24.168
-That sounds a
little bit like a threat to me.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.871
-Take it the way you want.

23:26.971 --> 23:28.239
But I'm giving you guys
the chance

23:28.339 --> 23:32.210
to do the honorable thing here,
okay?

23:32.310 --> 23:35.613
So, think on it, buddy.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.496
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

23:51.596 --> 23:53.665
-Goram, we got a problem.

24:46.184 --> 24:47.251
<i>Carver.</i>

24:47.352 --> 24:48.353
<i>Sorry I can't get to</i>
<i>the phone right now.</i>

24:48.453 --> 24:50.355
-Hey, Carver.
I just missed your call.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.758
Can you try me again later?
Thanks, bye.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.099
-Buddy,
I got your answer for you.

25:01.199 --> 25:04.302
Your answer is no.

25:04.402 --> 25:07.438
-Well, what two-bit piece
of shit wants the first swing?

25:49.113 --> 25:51.949
-Whoa! Who are you?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.252
-You're Major Carver's
daughter, right?

25:54.352 --> 25:56.220
-Yes, yes, and--
and who are you?

25:56.320 --> 25:57.955
-I'm a friend
of your dad's.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.024
-What are you doing here?

26:00.124 --> 26:03.127
-He said I could stay.

26:03.227 --> 26:06.097
-Dad! Dad!

26:06.197 --> 26:07.765
-He's not here.

26:07.865 --> 26:09.200
-Well, where is he?

26:09.300 --> 26:11.569
-I thought he was with you.

26:11.669 --> 26:14.906
-No, he--
he didn't come home last night.

26:15.006 --> 26:19.144
I thought he might have stayed
here after his group session.

26:19.243 --> 26:20.511
-Normally he does, but he left.

26:20.611 --> 26:23.815
He said he had to help you
with something.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.350
-Who the fuck are you?

26:26.451 --> 26:28.119
-My name is Burton,
Carl Burton.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.253
-Yes.

26:29.353 --> 26:33.691
-My dad used to be
in the same unit as--

26:33.791 --> 26:34.992
-Burton, yeah.

26:35.093 --> 26:39.097
Your--your dad was in the same
unit as mine for a bit.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.565
-Yes.

26:40.665 --> 26:45.570
-Yeah.
He talked about him a lot.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.072
Well, I'm worried about my dad.
What do I do?

26:48.173 --> 26:49.107
Do I call the police?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.108
-I don't think
they can do anything

26:50.209 --> 26:52.110
for the first 24 hours,
can they?

26:52.211 --> 26:54.479
-I mean, I have
called around all his friends

26:54.579 --> 26:56.848
and he tried to call Peck.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.150
Peck missed the call,

26:58.249 --> 27:00.752
and now Dad's phone goes
straight to voice mail.

27:00.852 --> 27:01.586
-Do you know what he meant

27:01.686 --> 27:03.888
when he said
help you with something?

27:03.988 --> 27:08.626
-No. Just ring me
if you hear anything from him.

27:08.726 --> 27:10.162
-Sure.

27:10.261 --> 27:11.129
-My number is on that.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.097
-Judy.

27:13.198 --> 27:15.099
-Yeah. Thank you.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.734
-Goodbye.

27:40.725 --> 27:43.461
Mrs. Marsh?

27:43.561 --> 27:47.098
-It's Miss. I'm divorced.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.766
I'm Detective Inspector Moore,

27:48.866 --> 27:51.203
and this is my colleague,
Detective Collins.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.838
Can we come in, please?

27:53.938 --> 27:55.072
-What's happened?

27:58.442 --> 28:01.946
<i>Oh, my god. Oh, no.</i>

28:02.046 --> 28:03.848
No, no, no, no.

28:03.948 --> 28:08.019
-We promise that we're
gonna find out who did this.

28:08.119 --> 28:11.656
We're gonna make them suffer
as much as they did your dad.

28:23.968 --> 28:26.003
-Hello?

28:26.103 --> 28:27.638
-Burton.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.942
-Judy.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.145
-It's my dad.

28:33.245 --> 28:36.614
He--

28:36.714 --> 28:38.449
-What is it?

28:38.549 --> 28:41.953
-He was found
yesterday afternoon,

28:42.053 --> 28:44.522
dead in a canal.

28:46.924 --> 28:48.926
-What happened?

28:49.026 --> 28:50.561
-He was murdered.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.498
-What can I do to help?

28:56.801 --> 28:59.238
-The police
are gonna pay you a visit.

28:59.338 --> 29:03.342
I told them that you are
at the apartment and,

29:03.441 --> 29:08.079
um, they want info about
his last known movements.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.481
-Yeah, of course.

29:12.351 --> 29:19.291
-And, um, I'll let you know
about the funeral.

29:19.390 --> 29:20.625
If that's okay, I mean.

29:20.725 --> 29:25.163
It would be great
if you could come.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.999
My dad would really
have wanted that.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.235
-Of course I'll be there.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.371
-Burton?

29:32.470 --> 29:35.340
-Yes, Judy?

29:35.439 --> 29:37.875
-Goodbye.

29:37.975 --> 29:39.010
-Bye.

29:59.463 --> 30:00.998
-Mr. Burton?

30:01.098 --> 30:02.401
-Yeah.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.568
-Can we trouble you
for a moment of your time?

30:05.937 --> 30:09.573
We understand you were staying
here the night he went missing.

30:09.674 --> 30:13.911
-Yeah.
I've been staying here.

30:14.011 --> 30:15.913
He was friends with my father.
They worked together.

30:16.013 --> 30:21.953
And we bumped into each other
a month or so ago

30:22.053 --> 30:24.789
and he recognized me,

30:24.889 --> 30:28.659
started inviting me
to the sessions and--

30:28.759 --> 30:29.927
-So, he was helping you out.

30:30.027 --> 30:31.430
Yeah.

30:31.529 --> 30:35.400
He was
very kind.

30:35.499 --> 30:37.269
-Well, from what
Judy has told us,

30:37.369 --> 30:40.405
her old man goes above and
beyond to help out ex-soldiers.

30:40.504 --> 30:43.607
-We want to catch
whoever did this, Mr. Burton.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.911
Did he mention any dealings
with gangs or--

30:47.011 --> 30:50.449
-Gangs? No.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.984
No, he didn't mention
any issues at all.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.819
-Did he mention
anything in particular?

30:54.919 --> 30:58.022
-No, he just said,
"You stay here, kid.

30:58.122 --> 30:59.890
I'll check in on you
in a couple of days."

30:59.991 --> 31:03.828
And told me he would be
staying at Judy's.

31:03.928 --> 31:07.265
I wish there was more
I could do to help.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.204
-Okay. Look, we'll leave you
to it, Mr. Burton.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.972
You know, if there's anything
that you can think of,

31:15.072 --> 31:18.542
please, don't hesitate to
give us a call.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.559
Thank you, Peck,
for putting this on.

31:35.659 --> 31:37.262
Least I can do, Judy.

31:40.531 --> 31:43.067
-Judy.
What a beautiful service, love.

31:43.168 --> 31:45.870
-Yeah, you did
your dad proud.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.439
Well done, Judy.

31:47.538 --> 31:48.739
-Thank you, gents.

31:48.839 --> 31:52.643
-Anything you need,
you let us know, all right?

31:52.743 --> 31:55.280
-I'm gonna
pop outside and get some air.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.014
-You do that.

31:57.114 --> 31:59.817
Thank you.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.586
-Thanks.

32:34.752 --> 32:37.189
-I hope
they find those bastards,

32:37.289 --> 32:40.325
lock 'em up,
and throw away the fucking key.

32:42.593 --> 32:46.831
-Judy, I'm sorry to ask,
but this thing

32:46.931 --> 32:51.936
that Major Carver was
helping you with, what was it?

32:52.036 --> 32:54.638
It's just that
the police asked me

32:54.738 --> 32:59.444
if Carver had
any dealings with gangs.

32:59.544 --> 33:02.046
-I'm councilor
for this district,

33:02.147 --> 33:05.183
and there's been a significant
rise in drug dealing,

33:05.283 --> 33:06.951
as well as violent crime.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.053
Now, I made several
police complaints.

33:09.154 --> 33:13.492
Then, not long after,
I began getting threats.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.994
I was being intimidated,
followed,

33:17.094 --> 33:18.028
sometimes threatened

33:18.129 --> 33:21.832
that if I didn't stop
causing problems, then--

33:21.932 --> 33:24.202
-And you told this
to your dad?

33:24.302 --> 33:29.073
-Well, yeah. I mean, this gang
run most of London now.

33:29.174 --> 33:31.075
-And who runs it?

33:31.176 --> 33:34.479
-His name is Goram.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.780
-What else
did you tell your dad?

33:36.881 --> 33:37.982
-Well, there's this spot

33:38.082 --> 33:39.618
that they've been using
frequently.

33:39.717 --> 33:42.853
It's a back road
off Leyton Avenue.

33:42.953 --> 33:44.989
-Why didn't you
tell the police?

33:45.089 --> 33:48.193
-I've been telling them
about this stuff for months,

33:48.293 --> 33:50.262
and they don't do anything.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.197
These guys never talk.

33:52.297 --> 33:56.000
Nothing ever leads back to the
people who are running things.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.636
I'm gonna go home.

33:57.735 --> 34:00.871
Will you, uh,
thank Peck again for me?

34:04.342 --> 34:05.910
-About the flat. I'm--

34:06.010 --> 34:08.413
-Oh, don't worry about that.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.047
You can stay.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.592
<i>Dirty stinking bastards.</i>

34:20.691 --> 34:22.327
-Yeah. Well, I'm sure
we'd all be good

34:22.427 --> 34:25.696
to get our hands on the fuckers
who did this, eh?

34:25.796 --> 34:27.731
Hey, come and join us.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.136
-What if you could
get your hands

34:31.236 --> 34:32.836
on the bastards, sir?

34:32.937 --> 34:34.071
-Do you know something?

34:36.641 --> 34:38.108
-Councilor Judy
has been having trouble

34:38.210 --> 34:43.148
with some low-level street scum
run by a man called Mr. Goram.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.049
They threatened her.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.386
I believe that Major Carver
tried to intervene.

34:50.988 --> 34:53.225
But I know where
this scum operate.

34:53.325 --> 34:59.129
-Oh, do you now?
So, what are you suggesting, eh?

34:59.231 --> 35:01.199
-Listen, I might not be
the brightest spark

35:01.299 --> 35:04.935
on our planet, but I know
what he's suggesting.

35:05.035 --> 35:06.571
-I'm just saying
that Major Carver

35:06.671 --> 35:08.506
was very good to me.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.476
He works with all of you.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.346
And what happened to him
isn't right.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.680
-No, it wasn't.

35:15.779 --> 35:18.717
-And the police aren't
gonna make it right, sir.

35:18.816 --> 35:22.687
They're either bent or
too scared to do anything.

35:22.786 --> 35:24.155
No witness
has ever come forward,

35:24.256 --> 35:27.726
so I'm gonna do
a reconnaissance.

35:27.825 --> 35:30.828
I'm gonna find out who
the big names are in this game

35:30.928 --> 35:35.267
that ordered his hit
and I'm gonna engage.

35:35.367 --> 35:40.070
And I'll do it alone,
but I'm looking for volunteers.

35:40.171 --> 35:41.473
-Ha!

35:41.573 --> 35:44.276
-Calm down, son,
calm down.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.145
You don't know what you're
letting yourself in for.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.614
This new lot that are running
the streets,

35:49.714 --> 35:51.182
they're fucking ruthless.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.584
-Yeah, well,
they may be ruthless,

35:52.684 --> 35:54.686
but they've not dealt with us,
have they, eh?

35:54.818 --> 35:56.655
The Magnificent Three?

35:56.755 --> 35:59.089
Four? No, I'm in.

36:00.791 --> 36:02.560
-What are you,
fucking crazy?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.396
It's a fucking suicide mission.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.464
-Harris.

36:06.564 --> 36:08.166
Every time I eat
a fucking pork pie,

36:08.266 --> 36:11.202
that's a suicide mission.
I'm in.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.103
-There's nothing wrong
with the pork pies.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.547
-Fine, fine.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.817
Okay, you wanna go out
in a blaze of fucking glory?

36:26.917 --> 36:30.588
I'm not staying here on me own
for the next meeting.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.157
I'm in.

36:33.625 --> 36:38.563
-So, we reconvene here
tomorrow and check our weaponry.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.334
-Done.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.568
-Okay.

36:45.069 --> 36:47.104
I'm not sure
what I've got...

36:50.675 --> 36:51.609
-Right.

37:01.252 --> 37:03.755
-A couple pigs in
to see you.

37:03.854 --> 37:07.525
All right.

37:16.401 --> 37:17.769
-Morning, Goram.

37:17.868 --> 37:19.204
-What do you need, love?

37:19.304 --> 37:20.805
-We were wondering
if you had some time

37:20.904 --> 37:22.873
to come and speak to us
at the station.

37:22.973 --> 37:24.975
-Oh, well, there's
absolutely no fucking chance

37:25.075 --> 37:26.944
that's happening, right?

37:27.044 --> 37:28.513
But if you wanna talk
right here, I'm fine with that.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.281
I'm assuming it's about
the old guy that got murdered,

37:30.382 --> 37:32.751
am I right?
-So you know about that?

37:32.851 --> 37:34.017
Do I know about it?

37:34.118 --> 37:36.488
Well, it's all over
the fucking news, isn't it?

37:36.588 --> 37:37.856
Let's have a look here.

37:37.955 --> 37:41.359
"Local war hero murdered."

37:41.459 --> 37:45.397
Yup, it's right here.
Fucking tell you something else.

37:45.497 --> 37:48.899
Breaks
my fucking heart, it does.

37:50.568 --> 37:51.870
-Where were you
on Monday night

37:51.969 --> 37:54.104
between 11:00 p.m.
and 2:00 a.m.?

37:54.205 --> 37:56.875
-Monday night?
Fuck, where were--

37:56.974 --> 37:58.209
-We were at cards, guv.

37:58.309 --> 38:01.179
-No, we went to the fucking--
now, wait a minute.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.013
Monday we went to see
me mother, didn't we?

38:03.113 --> 38:05.183
-No, we were. Beat ya.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.083
-It was cards.

38:06.184 --> 38:08.586
It was cards,
and you fucking beat me.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.455
Yes, four or five of us
actually.

38:10.555 --> 38:13.023
Witnesses, video recordings,
the whole nine yards,

38:13.123 --> 38:15.025
to be honest.
-We'd expect nothing less.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.594
-Yeah, well, in that case,

38:16.694 --> 38:18.696
what the fuck
are you doing here?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.698
-We thought
we'd drop in on you,

38:20.799 --> 38:22.434
just so you know
we're thinking of you.

38:22.534 --> 38:26.738
-Oh, wow, how touching.
You know, maybe next time

38:26.838 --> 38:28.640
you can shoot off
a fucking email,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.875
save yourself
a little travel time.

38:30.974 --> 38:34.212
Unless, of course,
you wanna come alone,

38:34.312 --> 38:36.915
and that's an entirely
different story, that is.

38:37.014 --> 38:37.916
-In your dreams.

38:38.015 --> 38:39.851
-Yeah, right?

38:39.950 --> 38:41.084
-We'll be on our way.

38:42.887 --> 38:43.987
-See you, Goram.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.792
-Oh, and be sure
to send those witnesses in

38:47.892 --> 38:49.327
to make their statements...

38:50.695 --> 38:52.630
and bring the video footage in.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.732
Time stamped would be nice.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.576
-You fucking pigs.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.414
Get 'em out
of my fucking building.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.715
-It's done.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.834
-Afternoon, gentlemen.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.402
-We've been waiting
for you two guys

40:04.502 --> 40:08.139
to come in and show you
the goods before the big reveal.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.208
-I can hardly
contain my excitement.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.977
Mr. Burton, good to see you.
-Sir.

40:13.076 --> 40:16.079
So, obviously
Her Majesty's government,

40:16.180 --> 40:20.552
Glock 17, 15,
couple of smoke grenades,

40:20.652 --> 40:21.920
first grenade in the bag.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.856
-Okay, for a start,
here's mine.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.358
-So, Harris,
you wanna go next?

40:27.458 --> 40:29.427
-Age before beauty,
my friend.

40:29.527 --> 40:30.828
-You saucy sod.

40:32.263 --> 40:37.201
The most dangerous thing I could
find in my shed was these.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.703
Oh, Christ, Woody!

40:38.803 --> 40:39.904
-What the fuck is that?

40:40.004 --> 40:41.539
-They're shears.

40:41.639 --> 40:42.373
-Back in the old day,

40:42.473 --> 40:43.708
we used to call you
Captain Ahab.

40:43.808 --> 40:44.876
What are we gonna call you now?

40:44.976 --> 40:49.714
- Well,
if that impressed you, um,

40:49.814 --> 40:51.114
what do you make of this?

40:53.184 --> 40:54.786
-Is that a fishing reel?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.387
-Of course.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.891
A very dangerous weapon
in my hands.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.159
-If you're a fish.

41:01.259 --> 41:02.627
-Christ, Woody,
what are you going for?

41:02.727 --> 41:03.962
Moby Dick?

41:04.062 --> 41:06.798
-Well, I've got something
far more impressive.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.935
-Well, that's marginally
better, I suppose.

41:11.035 --> 41:16.207
-And in my hands,
better than an AK-47.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.775
-Is that an harpoon?

41:17.875 --> 41:19.978
-Harpoon?

41:20.078 --> 41:22.747
It's a fucking crossbow,
you donut.

41:22.847 --> 41:24.582
-What have
you brought, Harris?

41:24.682 --> 41:28.720
-Ah. Well, I have brought to
the table, gentlemen...

41:30.388 --> 41:31.155
this.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.457
And what's this?

41:32.557 --> 41:37.695
Blow the fucking place up.

41:37.795 --> 41:39.464
I have got...

41:43.334 --> 41:47.572
there's this.
My piece de résistance...

41:50.842 --> 41:52.577
Is that a live Claymore?

41:52.677 --> 41:53.811
It certainly is.

41:53.911 --> 41:55.480
-Fuck me, Harris.

41:55.580 --> 41:57.782
You'd blow the arse
out of London with that.

41:57.882 --> 42:00.184
-That is the idea, Woody.

42:00.284 --> 42:05.056
-So, this is
our collective arsenal.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.392
-Not exactly
the Wild Geese, are we?

42:07.492 --> 42:10.061
-If anybody wants to
pull out of this operation,

42:10.161 --> 42:12.363
then now's the time to speak.

42:12.463 --> 42:13.998
-No, no, no.
We're still with you.

42:14.098 --> 42:16.300
We'll stick this
through to the end.

42:16.401 --> 42:17.335
-I'm in.

42:18.569 --> 42:20.171
-Harris?

42:20.271 --> 42:22.640
-Well, to be honest, Burton...

42:24.275 --> 42:26.644
I can't wait to
blow something up.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.979
-Looks like some sort of
exchange going on.

44:25.164 --> 44:26.864
-So what do you reckon?

44:26.964 --> 44:29.268
You think Carver came here?

44:29.367 --> 44:32.670
-Yes, I do,
and so do the police.

44:38.143 --> 44:39.977
-We wanna be in there, don't we?

44:40.077 --> 44:42.647
-You know, it occurs to me
we could use some intel.

44:42.747 --> 44:45.683
Yeah. I think it's about time
we visited Sanchez.

44:45.783 --> 44:46.717
-Who's Sanchez?

44:46.818 --> 44:47.752
-Sanchez.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.620
Ah, Sanchez, always
the font of all knowledge

44:49.720 --> 44:50.955
when it comes to London gangs.

44:51.055 --> 44:52.257
He knows them all:

44:52.356 --> 44:54.458
good, the bad, and fucking ugly,
too.

44:54.559 --> 44:59.096
-Right. Well, you go
and see Sanchez.

44:59.198 --> 45:00.665
Harris, do you fancy a drink?

45:02.567 --> 45:03.968
-Sure.

45:04.068 --> 45:05.369
-We'll pop in there.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.606
You got your phone on you?

45:08.706 --> 45:09.841
Yeah.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.642
-Do you know how it works?

45:14.912 --> 45:16.148
-You bein' funny?

45:16.248 --> 45:18.516
-Want you to take
a couple of pictures of

45:18.616 --> 45:21.153
in there,
send 'em to you,

45:21.253 --> 45:23.921
see if Sanchez makes any of 'em.

45:24.021 --> 45:25.489
-Yeah, okay.

45:25.590 --> 45:27.959
Oh, congratulations, Woody,
you got the evening off.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.660
-That's perfect, Peck.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.696
<i>Bake Off</i> 's on the box tonight.

45:31.796 --> 45:33.965
And I need to catch up,
I'm addicted.

45:34.065 --> 45:36.168
-That's good. There's no point
you coming anyway

45:36.268 --> 45:38.203
'cause you always argue
with Sanchez.

45:38.303 --> 45:40.104
-Can you give me a lift?

45:40.205 --> 45:43.040
-Yes, I suppose I could.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.609
Well, jolly good
good luck, chaps.

46:15.207 --> 46:16.741
-Evening, squire.

46:35.227 --> 46:37.296
The atmosphere in here...

46:37.396 --> 46:39.298
fuckin' hell.

46:41.233 --> 46:44.468
-Over your shoulder,
on your six,

46:44.568 --> 46:46.470
I think he's the one in charge.

46:48.706 --> 46:50.942
-We've had to break rule.

46:51.042 --> 46:52.977
-Do you think we need
to worry about Carver's old

46:53.077 --> 46:54.812
military veteran's facility?

46:54.912 --> 46:56.814
I mean, they're ex-military,
aren't they?

46:56.914 --> 46:59.717
-No, they're old.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.086
I don't think they're stupid
enough to mess with Goram.

47:03.654 --> 47:07.892
-I think it's time
for a selfie then, don't you?

47:07.992 --> 47:09.627
A selfie, you know.

47:09.727 --> 47:11.163
Would you--

47:11.263 --> 47:13.464
there you are, look.

47:13.564 --> 47:15.900
Press that button there.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.969
-No that's not a selfie.
A selfie is when you--

47:18.069 --> 47:20.671
-Look, just take
the fucking picture, all right?

47:22.506 --> 47:24.976
Get me good side.

47:29.046 --> 47:31.216
-Alright, one down.

47:31.316 --> 47:36.053
You send that to Peck and see if
his mate recognizes any of 'em.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.505
-Hello, Peck. Long time no see.

47:54.605 --> 47:55.673
-Hello, Gracie.

47:55.773 --> 47:57.342
Sanchez in a receptive mood
I hope?

47:57.442 --> 47:58.843
-As always.

48:01.078 --> 48:03.014
-This place
is pretty fucking done,

48:03.114 --> 48:05.750
so let's make our exit.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.188
Time for your bedtime, I think.

48:10.288 --> 48:11.689
-Fuck off.

48:13.958 --> 48:16.395
-Sanchez, my old mate.
How are you?

48:16.495 --> 48:19.063
- Hey!

48:19.164 --> 48:20.965
What, are you lost, old man?

48:21.065 --> 48:22.800
What are you doing
on this side of town?

48:22.900 --> 48:25.303
-Well, you know me. I always
like living dangerously.

48:25.404 --> 48:27.571
Yeah, I heard that.

48:27.671 --> 48:30.841
Hey, I'm sorry to hear
about Carver.

48:30.941 --> 48:34.979
He was a...
he was a good man, Peck.

48:35.079 --> 48:37.382
-Yes, he was.

48:37.482 --> 48:39.251
-Yeah, come on,
sit down. Have a drink.

48:47.192 --> 48:48.959
- Okay, <i>salud</i> .

48:52.963 --> 48:55.666
-Well, this relates to
Carver, actually.

48:55.766 --> 48:59.471
There's a crap-looking bar
over on Hardy Road

48:59.570 --> 49:01.038
and this guy's inside.

49:01.139 --> 49:02.673
What can you tell us?

49:02.773 --> 49:04.975
-That's one of Goram's
three henchmen.

49:05.076 --> 49:08.547
Together they call themselves
The Four Horsemen.

49:08.646 --> 49:11.949
<i>Anything that Goram wants,</i>
<i>he just takes,</i>

49:12.049 --> 49:15.487
<i>and he doesn't mind</i>
<i>getting his hands dirty.</i>

49:15.619 --> 49:17.588
-Oh, now you're not
going to go weird on me,

49:17.688 --> 49:18.956
are you, Sanchez, eh?

49:19.056 --> 49:22.026
We're not stumbling into
something biblical here, are we?

49:22.126 --> 49:24.695
-No.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.432
It's because of their
street reputation.

49:27.532 --> 49:30.868
Everywhere they go,
death follows.

49:32.636 --> 49:33.771
<i>They're part of</i>
<i>a crime syndicate</i>

49:33.871 --> 49:35.106
<i>running through Europe.</i>

49:35.207 --> 49:36.141
-Everything, it's yours.

49:36.241 --> 49:37.142
What about the vig?

49:37.242 --> 49:38.943
-They took the city by force.

49:39.043 --> 49:40.479
You understand what
that means, motherfucker?

49:40.579 --> 49:42.547
The vig?

49:42.646 --> 49:44.349
That's the tax.

49:48.253 --> 49:51.956
<i>They own a brothel</i>
<i>trafficking girls,</i>

49:52.056 --> 49:54.658
use them to cut and handle
all the drugs,

49:54.758 --> 49:56.627
<i>turn them into prostitutes.</i>

49:56.727 --> 49:58.497
-They sound adorb.

49:58.597 --> 50:01.132
-They're scum,
lowest kind.

50:01.233 --> 50:05.403
Look, I'm no angel, but, uh,
you know there's always been

50:05.504 --> 50:08.005
some kind of honor
amongst thieves

50:08.105 --> 50:09.907
'til these motherfuckers
showed up.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.444
Cops can't do a damn thing.

50:12.544 --> 50:15.247
Old-school gangsters
had to step aside.

50:17.482 --> 50:19.217
I have to wash money for 'em.

50:20.385 --> 50:22.587
-Oh, Jesus, mate.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.089
-I can't help it, homes. They're
ruthless.

50:26.525 --> 50:28.058
Why the interest?

50:28.160 --> 50:31.862
-Because these are
the bastards that killed Carver.

50:31.962 --> 50:35.900
-Peck,
if you're going up against them,

50:37.668 --> 50:39.770
you better be prepared.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.772
-Ha! They won't know
what hit 'em.

50:41.872 --> 50:44.675
And me and the boys are bringing
the bad band together.

50:44.775 --> 50:46.411
-You're like, renegades?

50:46.511 --> 50:49.414
-What? No... yeah.

50:49.514 --> 50:51.982
Hey, you wanna join in?

50:52.082 --> 50:54.952
-My knees are shot.
I can barely walk.

50:55.052 --> 51:00.958
My lenses on the glasses are
as big as a Hubble telescope.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.028
-And I pee five times a night,
what can I tell you?

51:04.128 --> 51:07.998
- No.
I'll give you information,

51:08.098 --> 51:10.435
but I got to sit this one out.

51:10.535 --> 51:14.439
I, uh...
I've got a young family.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.742
-I understand, mate.

51:18.842 --> 51:20.778
-Do me one favor, Peck.

51:22.280 --> 51:24.549
Kill the motherfuckers.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.376
-We'll go over this
one last time.

51:51.476 --> 51:53.578
Harris, you are our inside man.

51:53.678 --> 51:55.380
We let him settle.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.616
Woody, you cause a distraction.

51:57.716 --> 52:00.485
I engage from the back,
Peck from the front.

52:00.585 --> 52:02.254
We go in hard, and fast,
and hit them

52:02.354 --> 52:05.390
before they know
what's fucking happening.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.325
-You ready, Harris?

52:07.425 --> 52:09.361
-I was born ready, Woody.

52:21.206 --> 52:24.875
-Now that is what I call
a fucking improvement.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.745
-This from Quasimodo here.

52:26.844 --> 52:28.380
- the bell.

52:41.293 --> 52:46.096
-Nice decor.
Just like the mother-in-law's.

52:46.197 --> 52:48.065
-Twenty quid
for a half hour.

52:49.668 --> 52:53.471
-Don't start the timer until
I'm in the room, all right?

52:53.571 --> 52:55.440
I wanna get me money's worth.

52:55.540 --> 52:56.874
-What kind of woman
you want?

52:56.974 --> 53:00.345
-I dunno.
Dark hair, big tits.

53:00.445 --> 53:02.347
She'll do.

53:02.447 --> 53:03.947
-Come on.

53:15.260 --> 53:16.695
Got a half hour.

53:16.795 --> 53:18.363
I'll be outside.

53:35.112 --> 53:38.550
-Relax, love.
Not tonight.

54:08.246 --> 54:11.750
-Quick, check the front.
I'll check the back.

54:23.828 --> 54:25.896
-Warehouse. Location.

54:25.996 --> 54:28.333
-You're dead.
You're all dead.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.836
-You are gonna tell me.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.204
-Fuck you!

54:36.073 --> 54:38.075
-Um, you really need to work on

54:38.176 --> 54:39.943
your interrogation technique,
I think.

54:40.043 --> 54:42.380
-I'll work on that, sir.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.849
-You didn't get
the location of the warehouse?

54:44.948 --> 54:47.385
-No, we'll have to get it
when we hit the bar.

54:47.485 --> 54:49.119
-Oh, fuck.

54:49.220 --> 54:50.889
We're not gonna have time
to rifle through

54:50.988 --> 54:52.624
this place for info, are we?

54:52.724 --> 54:53.725
-The longer this goes on,

54:53.825 --> 54:55.860
we're gonna get rumbled
by the police.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.263
-I know where
the warehouse is.

54:58.363 --> 55:00.565
-Where is it?

55:00.665 --> 55:02.567
-Um, Mercen Street,
Unit 5.

55:02.667 --> 55:05.035
I remember when they brought us
here from the warehouse.

55:05.136 --> 55:08.071
-Good girl.
We need you to do something.

55:08.173 --> 55:10.408
Police are coming.
Don't tell them where we are,

55:10.508 --> 55:13.545
go back to your room,
play dumb, okay?

55:13.645 --> 55:15.814
-Okay. Wait, does this have
anything to do with

55:15.914 --> 55:17.515
the war hero that got killed?

55:17.615 --> 55:21.453
Because I heard the guy who
ordered the hit talk about it.

55:21.553 --> 55:22.921
-Who?

55:23.053 --> 55:24.322
<i>Goram.</i>

55:28.927 --> 55:31.196
Yeah, what is it?

55:31.296 --> 55:34.165
Savo, the fuck's going on?

55:34.265 --> 55:35.800
<i>Fucking Goram.</i>

55:35.900 --> 55:38.001
The man's a savage.

55:38.101 --> 55:40.037
No sense of honor, no code.

55:40.138 --> 55:42.507
-Oh, we can teach him
a fucking code.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.049
-There's cameras
all over this place.

55:52.150 --> 55:53.384
-And you know they're all
going to a remote server

55:53.485 --> 55:55.487
that only
one person has access to.

55:55.587 --> 55:58.723
-Yep, and he's not
gonna hand it over to us.

55:58.823 --> 56:00.225
Did the girls say anything?

56:00.325 --> 56:02.961
-Well, two of them are
still off their tits on smack.

56:03.060 --> 56:04.329
One of them hid,

56:04.429 --> 56:07.499
said she heard gunshots
but didn't see anything.

56:07.599 --> 56:08.733
They're all here illegally.

56:08.833 --> 56:11.302
I'll have someone from
immigration take care of 'em.

56:11.402 --> 56:12.770
-Okay, good.

56:12.871 --> 56:14.472
-What do you think?
Gang hit?

56:14.572 --> 56:16.207
Another turf war?

56:16.307 --> 56:19.042
-D'you know anyone
ballsy enough to pull this off?

56:19.143 --> 56:20.778
-Only you, mum.

56:20.879 --> 56:22.012
And me and you
were on duty together,

56:22.112 --> 56:22.981
so you can rule that one out.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.283
- No.

56:25.383 --> 56:28.219
I can't see this being
a rival we know about.

56:37.262 --> 56:38.363
-I'm gonna lock the front doors.

56:38.463 --> 56:40.865
-All right. Ah, it'll be
one of those drunks.

56:40.965 --> 56:43.001
Just tell him to fuck off.

56:58.816 --> 56:59.918
-Fuck off, old chap.

57:00.018 --> 57:01.252
It's been a long day,
you know what I mean?

57:01.352 --> 57:02.887
Fuckin' hell,
I need you, don't I?

57:02.987 --> 57:04.121
Oy, silly bollocks.

57:04.222 --> 57:05.723
Do you know who fuckin'
owns this place, eh?

57:05.823 --> 57:07.625
Fuckin'--

58:08.086 --> 58:09.454
Here you go, chump.

58:10.955 --> 58:12.724
Tell him what's going on.

58:18.262 --> 58:19.129
<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

58:19.230 --> 58:20.865
-I got hit, boss.

58:20.965 --> 58:22.634
-Fucking what?

58:22.734 --> 58:24.769
What's going on? Talk to me.

58:24.869 --> 58:26.304
-What is this, sunshine?

58:26.404 --> 58:28.506
-They got the ledger, boss.

58:28.606 --> 58:29.707
<i>If you can see 'em,</i>

58:29.807 --> 58:30.842
shoot 'em!

58:30.942 --> 58:33.077
Okay? Fucking kill 'em!

58:35.880 --> 58:37.749
-Savo!

58:37.849 --> 58:39.350
You're a fucking joke.

58:41.252 --> 58:43.287
-Souvenir, eh?
-Mm-hmm.

58:55.266 --> 58:56.401
-Oh, Christ's sake, Woody.

58:56.501 --> 58:57.535
What did you bring
this thing for?

58:58.936 --> 59:01.739
How the fuck did you think
that I cut through the wires?

59:08.212 --> 59:10.081
-That old prick
I whacked the other day.

59:10.181 --> 59:11.816
-What about him?
Fucking anything at all?

59:11.916 --> 59:13.518
When you fucking killed him,
did he say anything?

59:13.618 --> 59:16.087
-He was pissing out blood,
but something about

59:16.187 --> 59:18.022
woman from the council
being good friends.

59:18.122 --> 59:19.357
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

59:19.457 --> 59:22.393
-Councilwoman, all right.
Now get the boys together

59:22.493 --> 59:24.729
and follow this fucking
councilwoman around.

59:24.829 --> 59:26.964
If they're seen talking
to any of these geriatrics,

59:27.065 --> 59:28.167
give me a call.

59:28.266 --> 59:30.169
We need to know
who they are, right?

59:30.268 --> 59:31.469
-I'm on it.

59:31.569 --> 59:34.505
-And listen to me.
They have the fucking ledger.

59:34.605 --> 59:36.974
You of all people know what
that fucking means, right?

59:37.075 --> 59:38.509
We need it back at all costs.

59:38.609 --> 59:40.478
I don't care
how many people you kill.

59:40.578 --> 59:42.880
I don't care if you tear
the city apart brick by brick.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.549
Get the fucking ledger back,
right?

59:44.649 --> 59:45.650
-I get it.

59:45.750 --> 59:47.552
-Go fucking get it.

1:00:01.799 --> 1:00:03.067
-This isn't good, Moore.

1:00:03.168 --> 1:00:06.637
We have two dead criminals,
both known associates of Goram.

1:00:06.738 --> 1:00:08.306
-Two of the four
Horsemen dead now.

1:00:08.406 --> 1:00:11.143
-What? Horsemen?
Who comes up with this nonsense?

1:00:11.242 --> 1:00:14.078
This case is becoming
a thorn in my side.

1:00:14.179 --> 1:00:15.880
-We're actively
investigating, mum.

1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:19.617
-No one here will shed
any tears over these animals.

1:00:19.717 --> 1:00:22.386
Frankly, whoever's cleaning
house on these streets

1:00:22.487 --> 1:00:23.721
is doing the world a favor.

1:00:23.821 --> 1:00:26.591
My gut says
that this doesn't seem to be

1:00:26.691 --> 1:00:28.960
the power play of a rival gang.

1:00:29.060 --> 1:00:30.561
-So, you think
something personal?

1:00:31.829 --> 1:00:33.264
-Maybe.

1:00:34.832 --> 1:00:36.135
Any leads?

1:00:36.235 --> 1:00:37.535
-Nothing solid.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:40.605
Our only potential suspects
on that front are unlikely.

1:00:40.705 --> 1:00:44.509
It's a stretch--
Carver's ex-military pals.

1:00:44.609 --> 1:00:46.310
They're more of a threat
to the local bulls club

1:00:46.410 --> 1:00:47.378
than the gangs.

1:00:47.478 --> 1:00:50.081
-A bunch of
geriatric vigilantes?

1:00:50.182 --> 1:00:51.883
Are you clutching at straws?

1:00:51.983 --> 1:00:53.252
-It's difficult.

1:00:53.351 --> 1:00:56.287
-Ex-military...

1:00:56.387 --> 1:00:58.556
that could come up with blocks

1:00:58.656 --> 1:01:02.093
on a background check
above our clearance.

1:01:02.194 --> 1:01:07.899
Didn't you date
some ex-CIA spook once,

1:01:07.999 --> 1:01:09.333
Agent Donovan, was it?

1:01:09.433 --> 1:01:10.735
Could he get intel?

1:01:10.835 --> 1:01:12.837
-Look, I'd rather not
dig up the past.

1:01:16.307 --> 1:01:18.277
-What do you think,
too much?

1:01:18.376 --> 1:01:20.378
-It's a drunk fisherman
that we need to talk to.

1:01:23.014 --> 1:01:26.185
-I'll take a Glock
in case he falls in the water.

1:01:31.722 --> 1:01:33.192
-Oh, do it
for the greater good,

1:01:33.292 --> 1:01:34.859
for queen and country.

1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:37.528
-Okay.

1:01:37.628 --> 1:01:40.665
-What exactly
does Donovan do?

1:01:40.765 --> 1:01:44.735
I mean, if he helps,
it must all be aboveboard.

1:01:44.836 --> 1:01:48.005
-Well, he can't get the intel
through legitimate channels.

1:01:48.105 --> 1:01:51.108
His day-to-day is breaking up
human trafficking rings.

1:02:01.652 --> 1:02:04.755
But let's just say that part's
not always by the book.

1:02:17.034 --> 1:02:17.969
-Fuck.

1:02:18.069 --> 1:02:19.370
-Hands behind your head.

1:02:19.470 --> 1:02:21.472
Get out here.

1:02:32.150 --> 1:02:35.052
-Someone needs to put
the trash out in this city.

1:02:58.409 --> 1:03:04.582
-Why are you watching her? Ey?

1:03:04.682 --> 1:03:06.817
-Piss off, you old boiled
sweet eating fucker!

1:03:07.785 --> 1:03:10.454
That's pretty funny.

1:03:10.554 --> 1:03:12.123
Boiled sweet, that's really--

1:03:14.359 --> 1:03:15.927
-Now.

1:03:16.027 --> 1:03:21.199
You are gonna go back to those
wankers that you work for.

1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:22.667
You're gonna tell them

1:03:22.767 --> 1:03:27.272
that their days
are fucking numbered.

1:03:27.372 --> 1:03:28.940
-Okay, okay.

1:03:32.977 --> 1:03:34.445
-Burton, what's up?

1:03:34.545 --> 1:03:35.846
-Something's happened.

1:03:35.947 --> 1:03:37.149
-What?

1:03:37.249 --> 1:03:40.017
-You might wanna spend
a few days at your dad's place.

1:03:40.117 --> 1:03:41.186
-This is insane.

1:03:41.286 --> 1:03:43.188
-You get packed.
I'll explain.

1:03:44.956 --> 1:03:47.225
<i>You lot are a bunch of fools!</i>

1:03:47.326 --> 1:03:49.627
<i>You better give me</i>
<i>one good reason</i>

1:03:49.727 --> 1:03:52.096
<i>why I shouldn't go</i>
<i>to the police right now.</i>

1:04:06.110 --> 1:04:07.645
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Detective Inspector Moore.

1:04:07.745 --> 1:04:10.681
-Donovan,
what have you got for me?

1:04:10.781 --> 1:04:13.084
-Anne,
I'm going out on a limb for you.

1:04:13.185 --> 1:04:14.919
This is highly classified.

1:04:15.019 --> 1:04:16.654
-I appreciate it.

1:04:16.754 --> 1:04:18.689
So, what am I dealing with?

1:04:18.789 --> 1:04:20.958
-These guys
have seen a lot of action.

1:04:21.058 --> 1:04:24.162
Peck, Harris, Woodward,
they all served together

1:04:24.262 --> 1:04:27.898
in the late '60s, did tours
in Ireland and the Falklands.

1:04:27.999 --> 1:04:31.669
Before that, they did
some black operations in Europe.

1:04:31.769 --> 1:04:34.306
Later on, they were doing
mercenary work.

1:04:34.406 --> 1:04:38.176
-Christ.
So, they're hardcore.

1:04:38.276 --> 1:04:39.344
-Well, they were.

1:04:39.444 --> 1:04:40.845
At this age,

1:04:40.945 --> 1:04:43.681
I don't know how much fight
they still have in them.

1:04:43.781 --> 1:04:47.084
And I can't say if they're the
ones picking off your gangsters.

1:04:47.185 --> 1:04:48.686
But there was a time

1:04:48.786 --> 1:04:50.955
that this was a typical day
for these guys.

1:04:51.055 --> 1:04:53.492
-So, what can you tell me
about Burton?

1:04:53.591 --> 1:04:56.461
-Burton's old man served
with Carver in Vietnam

1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:59.730
and again, special operations
across the world.

1:04:59.830 --> 1:05:02.666
I guess the apple don't fall
far from the tree.

1:05:02.767 --> 1:05:07.506
Burton Jr., he had tours in
Iraq, Afghanistan and Bosnia,

1:05:07.605 --> 1:05:10.509
and several
unclassified missions.

1:05:10.608 --> 1:05:13.644
His last outing Bosnia
was a total shit show.

1:05:13.744 --> 1:05:17.615
The mission went to hell,
extraction was withdrawn.

1:05:17.715 --> 1:05:19.351
<i>He was</i>
<i>the only one to get out.</i>

1:05:19.451 --> 1:05:20.918
<i>Kind of fell off the grid</i>
<i>since then.</i>

1:05:21.018 --> 1:05:24.822
-So, Burton has the capacity
to pull this off?

1:05:24.922 --> 1:05:27.492
-Burton alone, no.
These old guys alone, no.

1:05:27.591 --> 1:05:29.827
But together, maybe.
And you know what?

1:05:30.761 --> 1:05:34.332
If these are the guys,

1:05:34.433 --> 1:05:37.068
good luck
to these crazy old bastards.

1:05:37.169 --> 1:05:40.704
-You see here,
this is all shipping information

1:05:40.805 --> 1:05:43.007
and dates and details.

1:05:43.107 --> 1:05:47.578
But here,
these are all payments made

1:05:47.678 --> 1:05:49.980
to politicians
and bent coppers.

1:05:50.081 --> 1:05:52.484
-Christ, how do you
make sense of all this?

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:54.085
I can't make
heads or tail of it.

1:05:54.186 --> 1:05:56.921
-You'll have to ask
the code breaker over there.

1:05:57.021 --> 1:05:59.023
-Who, Harris?

1:05:59.123 --> 1:06:01.326
-I like a good puzzle.

1:06:01.426 --> 1:06:03.528
-Sudoku's one thing.

1:06:03.627 --> 1:06:05.830
Hey, Harris, this is impressive.

1:06:06.797 --> 1:06:09.667
-I'm full of surprises,
aren't I?

1:06:09.767 --> 1:06:11.436
-Thanks, Donovan.

1:06:11.536 --> 1:06:13.138
It's really been a help.

1:06:13.238 --> 1:06:14.972
-Annie, you want my advice?

1:06:15.072 --> 1:06:16.575
-Okay.

1:06:16.674 --> 1:06:18.343
-Stay out of the crossfire.

1:06:18.443 --> 1:06:20.245
These guys want to clean house?

1:06:20.345 --> 1:06:23.448
Let 'em flush the turds,
save the city some money.

1:06:23.548 --> 1:06:25.749
That's just my personal
standpoint,

1:06:25.850 --> 1:06:27.252
<i>off the record, of course.</i>

1:06:27.352 --> 1:06:29.053
-But of course.

1:06:29.154 --> 1:06:30.388
-Take care.

1:06:30.489 --> 1:06:35.227
Anne, I'd like to take you
dinner next time I'm in London.

1:06:35.327 --> 1:06:37.496
You know I'd like to see you.

1:06:37.596 --> 1:06:39.130
-Always the optimist.

1:06:48.140 --> 1:06:51.610
-Peck, and you're right.
I don't like the warehouse.

1:06:51.709 --> 1:06:55.614
It's too large, too many
unknowns with the interior.

1:06:55.713 --> 1:06:57.648
-Yeah, we need to
funnel them in someplace,

1:06:57.748 --> 1:06:58.649
somewhere we know.

1:06:58.749 --> 1:07:00.117
-Suggestions?

1:07:00.218 --> 1:07:02.254
-Ta-da. Here.

1:07:02.354 --> 1:07:04.322
-Oh, man.
You gotta be joking.

1:07:04.422 --> 1:07:05.557
-Are you sure?

1:07:05.656 --> 1:07:07.292
-Gents,
it's just a building.

1:07:07.392 --> 1:07:10.961
-Yeah, but it's my local.

1:07:11.061 --> 1:07:12.096
-I own it.

1:07:12.197 --> 1:07:14.366
Come on! Look, we know
the place inside and out.

1:07:14.466 --> 1:07:16.568
Tactically,
it's the logical choice.

1:07:16.667 --> 1:07:19.137
-Right, so we still
hit the warehouse,

1:07:19.237 --> 1:07:20.704
put on a few surprises,

1:07:20.804 --> 1:07:22.607
really stoke up
the hornets' nest,

1:07:22.706 --> 1:07:25.177
and draw Goram out
to find us.

1:07:25.277 --> 1:07:26.645
-Yes. He won't come alone.

1:07:26.744 --> 1:07:29.747
-I don't doubt it.
But you can put word out

1:07:29.847 --> 1:07:33.652
through your friend Sanchez
about our whereabouts.

1:07:33.751 --> 1:07:36.188
-Yeah, I guess I could.
Yeah, I'll give him a call,

1:07:36.288 --> 1:07:38.722
see if I can get him
to bait the hook, eh?

1:07:38.822 --> 1:07:40.659
-If that's all sorted,

1:07:40.758 --> 1:07:42.460
I think we should have
another drink, don't you?

1:07:42.561 --> 1:07:43.595
-Yeah.

1:07:43.694 --> 1:07:45.930
Come on, you know
where the glasses are.

1:08:00.679 --> 1:08:02.746
-Is this ever gonna end?

1:08:02.846 --> 1:08:04.316
I don't agree with
what you're doing.

1:08:04.416 --> 1:08:08.852
-You do agree
that Goram is evil. Don't you?

1:08:08.953 --> 1:08:11.456
When we were on operations,
a warlord behaved like him,

1:08:11.556 --> 1:08:13.191
we'd do something about it.

1:08:14.858 --> 1:08:19.763
Come home, see worse,
and you expect us to do nothing?

1:08:21.832 --> 1:08:24.768
When it's done,
and he's gone,

1:08:24.868 --> 1:08:28.038
I'll go,
if that's what you want.

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.776
Thank you.

1:08:48.125 --> 1:08:49.628
Hey.

1:09:05.477 --> 1:09:07.044
-Fry 'em!

1:09:13.851 --> 1:09:16.621
Loves that bloody
crossbow, doesn't he?

1:09:45.082 --> 1:09:47.185
-All right, it's all set.

1:11:23.914 --> 1:11:25.015
-Hey.

1:11:25.115 --> 1:11:26.451
-Sanchez, old boy.

1:11:26.551 --> 1:11:27.752
-Hey, Peck.

1:11:27.852 --> 1:11:28.986
Enough of that old
guy stuff, huh.

1:11:29.086 --> 1:11:30.921
I was just gonna call you.

1:11:31.021 --> 1:11:32.457
-Oh, yeah? What's up?

1:11:32.557 --> 1:11:36.927
-Goram has the whole of London
looking for you guys.

1:11:37.027 --> 1:11:39.731
-Tempted to turn us in, are you?

1:11:39.831 --> 1:11:44.469
-No. Bastard wouldn't even offer
a reward, so you're safe.

1:11:44.569 --> 1:11:48.840
- Well, as it happens,
we want you to stitch us up.

1:11:48.939 --> 1:11:50.708
-What are you, crazy?

1:11:50.809 --> 1:11:52.042
-We're laying a trap, okay?

1:11:52.143 --> 1:11:54.279
Specifically,
get the word out to Goram.

1:11:54.379 --> 1:11:57.014
We want you to reveal
the location of the Legion.

1:11:57.114 --> 1:11:59.584
But listen,
keep yourself clean, mate.

1:11:59.684 --> 1:12:02.454
You know, don't go around
to Goram yourself with this.

1:12:02.554 --> 1:12:03.721
-Yeah, I'll get it out.

1:12:03.822 --> 1:12:06.224
I got the right guy to do it.

1:12:06.324 --> 1:12:10.495
And don't worry, I'll be sure
it won't come back to me.

1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:22.874
-Guv.

1:12:22.973 --> 1:12:23.974
-Yeah, what is it?

1:12:24.074 --> 1:12:25.376
-You got a phone call.

1:12:25.477 --> 1:12:27.846
He says you're definitely
gonna want to talk to him.

1:12:27.946 --> 1:12:28.913
-Who is it?

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:30.448
-Apollo Jackson.

1:12:31.950 --> 1:12:33.785
-Yeah, put it through,
and get the fuck out.

1:12:33.885 --> 1:12:36.654
-One more thing.
We got eyes on the woman.

1:12:36.754 --> 1:12:38.723
Do you want me
to get her lifted?

1:12:38.823 --> 1:12:42.760
-Yeah, make it happen.

1:12:44.896 --> 1:12:46.331
-Apollo, to what do I owe
the pleasure?

1:12:46.431 --> 1:12:48.600
-I hear you looking
for some information

1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:52.837
about a group of old men
that tore your ass up.

1:12:52.937 --> 1:12:54.739
-Yeah, nothing
we can't handle ourselves.

1:12:54.839 --> 1:12:55.807
<i>I got a tip</i>

1:12:55.907 --> 1:12:58.443
that the group
was some old war vets

1:12:58.543 --> 1:13:02.112
who hang around at the bar
on Norton Road.

1:13:02.213 --> 1:13:03.915
I looked into the owner.

1:13:04.014 --> 1:13:06.885
Peck's ex-military,
special ops.

1:13:06.985 --> 1:13:08.253
-Don't you worry about it, okay?

1:13:08.353 --> 1:13:10.655
-I hear things.
You wanna know what I hear?

1:13:10.755 --> 1:13:12.257
-What do you hear? Tell me.

1:13:12.357 --> 1:13:13.191
<i>I understand</i>

1:13:13.291 --> 1:13:14.759
you killed a vet called Carver.

1:13:14.859 --> 1:13:17.395
-The old fellow, he was
looking for fucking trouble.

1:13:17.495 --> 1:13:19.797
-You brought
this shit to your door.

1:13:19.898 --> 1:13:21.966
So, you better finish.

1:13:22.065 --> 1:13:23.133
-Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

1:13:23.234 --> 1:13:24.736
<i>You're a small-time</i>

1:13:24.836 --> 1:13:27.672
...bitch!
Don't you ever forget that.

1:13:27.772 --> 1:13:29.541
You work for my association.

1:13:29.641 --> 1:13:32.176
<i>You let your ego</i>
<i>blind you, fool,</i>

1:13:32.277 --> 1:13:33.511
<i>you hear what I'm sayin'?</i>

1:13:33.611 --> 1:13:34.479
All them old soldiers,

1:13:34.579 --> 1:13:36.581
they have
crippled your organization.

1:13:36.681 --> 1:13:37.849
Kill them.

1:13:37.949 --> 1:13:39.284
-Nothing we can't take care of.

1:13:39.384 --> 1:13:40.919
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1:13:41.019 --> 1:13:42.186
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1:13:42.287 --> 1:13:44.889
Tick-tock, motherfucker.

1:13:46.457 --> 1:13:48.526
If you don't clean this mess up,

1:13:48.626 --> 1:13:50.562
<i>you gonna retire early.</i>

1:13:50.662 --> 1:13:52.397
Do you understand that?

1:13:52.497 --> 1:13:55.733
Sleep with your lights on.
You done pissed me off.

1:13:56.801 --> 1:13:57.835
-Yakveni!

1:14:01.372 --> 1:14:03.207
-What the fuck did he want?

1:14:03.308 --> 1:14:05.743
-Gave me a little intel.

1:14:05.843 --> 1:14:09.380
Filled me in on where
these geriatrics are at, so.

1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:11.649
Gather the boys,
let's get ready for war.

1:14:23.995 --> 1:14:25.597
-No! No!

1:14:25.697 --> 1:14:28.066
No! Help me! Help!

1:14:43.915 --> 1:14:45.283
-Approaching target,

1:14:46.985 --> 1:14:48.353
<i>T minus 30 seconds.</i>

1:14:53.658 --> 1:14:54.959
<i>OX-2 firing.</i>

1:14:55.059 --> 1:14:56.294
<i>Fire!</i>

1:15:09.807 --> 1:15:12.010
Everything is set.

1:15:12.110 --> 1:15:15.079
We are prepared.

1:15:15.179 --> 1:15:17.815
-So, how are we
feeling, chaps, eh?

1:15:17.915 --> 1:15:19.484
-I'm okay.

1:15:20.818 --> 1:15:25.390
-When I was younger, about 25,
I couldn't give a monkey's fuck

1:15:25.490 --> 1:15:28.793
if I got killed in the crossfire
of a firefight.

1:15:28.893 --> 1:15:31.129
But now I'm a little bit older,

1:15:31.229 --> 1:15:33.531
I've decided I'd like to
see this one through

1:15:33.631 --> 1:15:35.266
right to the end.

1:15:35.366 --> 1:15:37.602
-Think we all would, matey.

1:15:37.702 --> 1:15:39.270
Think we all would.

1:15:44.409 --> 1:15:46.911
Why are you smiling?

1:15:47.011 --> 1:15:51.249
-Because this is the only
thing I'm any fucking good at.

1:15:53.317 --> 1:15:55.019
-Well, I think
a toast is called for

1:15:55.119 --> 1:15:56.754
while we still can, yeah?

1:15:56.854 --> 1:15:59.158
Calm before the storm.

1:15:59.290 --> 1:16:00.858
-To Carver.

1:16:00.958 --> 1:16:02.226
-To Carver.

1:16:03.327 --> 1:16:04.629
-Certainly drink to that.

1:16:42.201 --> 1:16:43.835
-You and me
take the rear.

1:16:43.935 --> 1:16:45.636
You four at the front, go!

1:16:53.145 --> 1:16:55.646
-Okay, we're on.
Company incoming,

1:16:55.747 --> 1:16:59.083
and they ain't looking pretty,
especially your one.

1:16:59.184 --> 1:17:00.585
Right!

1:17:00.685 --> 1:17:02.253
Positions.

1:17:02.353 --> 1:17:06.158
And try not to get shot.

1:17:23.074 --> 1:17:24.942
-Got you.

1:17:30.081 --> 1:17:32.383
Hey! You soppy prick.

1:17:32.483 --> 1:17:34.018
That's our best scotch!

1:17:35.254 --> 1:17:38.089
Down, Woody!

1:17:51.602 --> 1:17:52.737
Eat this.

1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:10.988
Back, back, back, back!

1:18:18.830 --> 1:18:19.897
-Fuck it!

1:18:51.230 --> 1:18:53.931
-Shots fired at the Legion.
Units are seven minutes away.

1:18:54.031 --> 1:18:55.366
-We're not far. Let's go.

1:19:08.146 --> 1:19:09.580
-What's your name,
you old bastard!

1:19:26.265 --> 1:19:29.400
- Oh, fuck! Fuck!

1:19:49.221 --> 1:19:50.655
-All right.

1:19:50.755 --> 1:19:54.226
I want that fucking ledger
back, Burton.

1:19:54.326 --> 1:19:56.560
-How about
you eat your bullet?

1:19:56.661 --> 1:19:57.895
-No.

1:19:57.995 --> 1:20:02.334
How about I blow her head clean
off her fucking shoulders, mate?

1:20:02.433 --> 1:20:05.670
Oh, go on, take the shot.
Do it.

1:20:05.770 --> 1:20:08.373
-Don't you fucking tempt me.

1:20:08.472 --> 1:20:11.809
-Actually, how about you
give me the fucking ledger

1:20:11.909 --> 1:20:13.278
and your life--

1:20:13.378 --> 1:20:15.280
-How about bollocks?

1:20:15.380 --> 1:20:16.415
-Drop the fucking gun
or I'll do it, mate,

1:20:16.514 --> 1:20:17.448
I'll fucking do it.

1:20:20.484 --> 1:20:22.920
There you go. Yeah.

1:20:23.020 --> 1:20:25.324
There you go.

1:20:27.426 --> 1:20:28.492
-The fuck!

1:20:46.477 --> 1:20:48.012
-Police!
Hands above your head.

1:20:48.112 --> 1:20:49.580
Don't even think about it.

1:20:50.815 --> 1:20:52.116
What the fuck did you do?

1:20:52.217 --> 1:20:53.452
Get the.

1:21:14.638 --> 1:21:16.040
-I want you to know,

1:21:16.141 --> 1:21:18.609
neither one of us is
getting out alive, all right?

1:21:18.709 --> 1:21:20.544
-Shut up and fight me.

1:21:20.644 --> 1:21:23.148
-By the way, you met Lurch?

1:21:45.437 --> 1:21:47.071
Come on.

1:21:47.172 --> 1:21:49.408
Come on.

1:22:08.559 --> 1:22:09.494
-Run!

1:22:16.368 --> 1:22:17.436
-Come on!

1:22:20.604 --> 1:22:21.473
Moby--

1:22:21.572 --> 1:22:22.773
Dick!

1:22:24.875 --> 1:22:25.876
-We'll be hearing about this

1:22:25.976 --> 1:22:28.313
for the rest of
our fucking lives.

1:22:40.525 --> 1:22:41.892
-And he's dead.

1:22:44.162 --> 1:22:48.233
Legion's just up ahead.
What do you wanna do?

1:22:48.333 --> 1:22:49.900
-ETA backup on Norton Road.

1:22:53.338 --> 1:22:54.439
-Fuck.

1:22:54.539 --> 1:22:56.141
- Oh, Burton! Oh!

1:22:58.609 --> 1:23:00.278
Judy, you all right?

1:23:00.378 --> 1:23:01.912
-Is it over?
Is it over?

1:23:02.012 --> 1:23:04.982
-Yeah, yeah.
It's definitely over.

1:23:20.030 --> 1:23:22.267
-Fucking hell, he's dead, too.

1:23:28.273 --> 1:23:30.774
Now that's what I call
a coincidence.

1:23:30.875 --> 1:23:32.977
We were just about to call you.

1:23:33.077 --> 1:23:34.346
-Oh, were you now?

1:23:34.446 --> 1:23:36.914
-Of course we were, officer.

1:23:37.014 --> 1:23:39.584
-Okay, chaps, I suppose
you can explain all this?

1:23:39.683 --> 1:23:43.555
-Yes. Well, they were armed,
and they broke in.

1:23:43.654 --> 1:23:45.055
I don't know what gave the idea

1:23:45.157 --> 1:23:47.425
there was anything
valuable in here.

1:23:47.526 --> 1:23:49.427
-And you don't know
who they are

1:23:49.528 --> 1:23:52.129
or the fact
they work for Goram?

1:23:52.230 --> 1:23:54.533
-Goram? Who's Goram?

1:23:54.633 --> 1:23:55.766
-Well, they broke in

1:23:55.866 --> 1:23:59.538
and we were forced
to defend ourselves.

1:23:59.638 --> 1:24:01.139
-With weapons at hand?

1:24:01.239 --> 1:24:03.841
-Oh, well, you see,
I'm very sentimental, officer,

1:24:03.941 --> 1:24:05.776
and I like to
have them on display.

1:24:05.876 --> 1:24:08.547
Bloody lucky I do, too,
otherwise we'd be toast.

1:24:08.647 --> 1:24:10.215
Wouldn't we, fellows?

1:24:10.315 --> 1:24:11.882
-Very lucky.

1:24:11.982 --> 1:24:16.720
-Oh, one of them
dropped this.

1:24:19.624 --> 1:24:21.293
-They dropped a ledger?

1:24:25.263 --> 1:24:27.199
And what's this?

1:24:27.299 --> 1:24:30.335
-The keys to the code, love.

1:24:30.435 --> 1:24:32.370
-During a break in
and shoot out,

1:24:32.470 --> 1:24:35.105
you guys had time
to crack a code?

1:24:35.207 --> 1:24:36.341
-Yeah.

1:24:36.441 --> 1:24:40.911
I mean, we are
full of surprises.

1:24:41.011 --> 1:24:43.348
-Well, there's
an ambulance en route.

1:24:43.448 --> 1:24:47.219
I suggest you guys get seen to.

1:24:47.319 --> 1:24:48.819
-What about the guns?

1:24:50.422 --> 1:24:52.022
-Do you mind
if we look around?

1:24:52.122 --> 1:24:55.427
-Be my guest.
Just don't break anything.

1:25:22.886 --> 1:25:25.490
-A final toast
to Major Carver.

1:25:25.590 --> 1:25:27.192
-I think that's great of you.

1:25:28.693 --> 1:25:29.694
Thank you.

1:25:29.793 --> 1:25:32.062
-To Carver.
-To Carver.

1:25:42.039 --> 1:25:43.974
-Oh, excuse me, lads.

1:25:46.810 --> 1:25:48.613
-Hey, Peck!

1:25:48.713 --> 1:25:50.515
-Sanchez.

1:25:50.615 --> 1:25:51.716
-I thought
I'd call you and tell you

1:25:51.815 --> 1:25:54.885
that you did one hell of a job.

1:25:54.985 --> 1:25:56.621
-I couldn't have done it
without you, Sanchez,

1:25:56.721 --> 1:25:58.022
so thank you.

1:25:58.122 --> 1:26:01.025
-Yeah, anytime, homes.
Hey, you know what?

1:26:01.125 --> 1:26:03.728
I just wish I could have
been there to see it.

1:26:03.827 --> 1:26:05.896
-Ha!
Well, maybe next time, eh.

1:26:05.996 --> 1:26:08.166
If there is a next time.

1:26:08.266 --> 1:26:11.403
-Well, old friend,
it's funny you say that.

1:26:11.503 --> 1:26:15.273
A friend of mine is on his way
to see you right now.

1:26:15.373 --> 1:26:16.907
-Oh yes, a friend?

1:26:17.007 --> 1:26:19.943
-You'll see, Peck.
Later!

1:26:24.048 --> 1:26:26.384
-Sorry, we're closed.

1:26:26.484 --> 1:26:28.353
-I'm not here for a drink.

1:26:31.256 --> 1:26:32.890
Now, you're Peck.

1:26:32.990 --> 1:26:37.295
You're Mr. Woody, Mr. Burton,
Mr. Harris,

1:26:37.395 --> 1:26:41.333
and I assume the lady
is late Mr. Carver's daughter.

1:26:44.302 --> 1:26:46.338
And Detective Moore.

1:26:46.438 --> 1:26:48.540
-Don't pull it again.

1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:51.710
-I got a funny feeling
that we've got a mutual friend.

1:26:51.810 --> 1:26:53.678
Could we have a name, please?

1:26:53.778 --> 1:26:55.045
-My name is Palmer.

1:26:55.146 --> 1:26:58.650
-Palmer, what agency
do you work for?

1:26:58.750 --> 1:27:00.685
-I'm not at liberty
to divulge my employers.

1:27:00.785 --> 1:27:02.086
But needless to say,

1:27:02.187 --> 1:27:04.855
they've taken
a very serious interest

1:27:04.955 --> 1:27:10.395
in the sudden end of
Anthony Goram's criminal empire.

1:27:10.495 --> 1:27:12.597
We'd like to hire your services.

1:27:12.697 --> 1:27:14.532
Okay, look, chum.

1:27:14.632 --> 1:27:17.935
I do wedding receptions
and the occasional.

1:27:18.035 --> 1:27:20.305
-I wouldn't be so coy,
Mr. Peck.

1:27:20.405 --> 1:27:22.807
We know all about you.

1:27:22.906 --> 1:27:26.043
Don't worry about
repercussions over Goram.

1:27:26.144 --> 1:27:27.878
You did the city a favor.

1:27:27.978 --> 1:27:30.248
-Do we get
a choice in this?

1:27:30.348 --> 1:27:34.386
-Of course.
We're all on the good side here.

1:27:34.486 --> 1:27:37.255
Read the files.

1:27:37.355 --> 1:27:40.692
If you want the assignment,
let me know.

1:27:40.792 --> 1:27:42.660
But you're our first choice.

1:27:46.063 --> 1:27:48.400
I'll call for an answer
tomorrow.

1:27:58.743 --> 1:28:00.978
This does worry me.

1:28:01.078 --> 1:28:02.946
I mean, where has it been?

1:28:03.046 --> 1:28:04.849
-I think I know where he
brought that into the country.

1:28:07.218 --> 1:28:08.952
-Good job
it wasn't the fucking ledger.

1:28:23.668 --> 1:28:25.370
Hey, boss.

1:28:25.470 --> 1:28:26.704
-Apollo.

1:28:26.805 --> 1:28:29.106
-I got some bad news, man.

1:28:29.207 --> 1:28:30.542
<i>Goram, he fell.</i>

1:28:30.642 --> 1:28:32.577
All the Horsemen, they dead.

1:28:32.677 --> 1:28:34.011
The whole operation crumbled.

1:28:34.111 --> 1:28:35.513
<i>We need to</i>
<i>take back the fifth</i>

1:28:35.613 --> 1:28:37.415
<i>and eliminate our enemies.</i>

1:28:37.515 --> 1:28:40.083
I'll be in contact
with the local mercenaries.

1:28:40.185 --> 1:28:42.520
They'll be waiting for you.

1:28:42.620 --> 1:28:43.788
-Fucking renegades.
