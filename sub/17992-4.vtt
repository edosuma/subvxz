{\an8}Stop touching me, Teairra.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.108
{\an8}I told you not to
invite this bitch, yo.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.342
{\an8}I have love for you.

00:09.409 --> 00:12.178

accept that, then that's fine.

Soulja Boy and Corrine.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.650
{\an8}There was you in the picture.

00:17.717 --> 00:18.651
{\an8}You got [bleep] that.

00:18.718 --> 00:19.686
{\an8}See, I don't want you
to touch me right now.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.854

{\an8}If you had a party going on.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.159
{\an8}You're saying the same
thing over and over.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.094
{\an8}I have nothing to do with any
of the issues you

00:28.161 --> 00:29.195
{\an8}and your mom have.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.330
{\an8}You want me to talk to her?

00:30.397 --> 00:31.431
{\an8}Some people you gotta check.

00:31.498 --> 00:32.631
{\an8}I love both of you.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.733
{\an8}You're my mom, you're my lady.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.768
{\an8}I do not like you.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.870
{\an8}Who is Maskia?

00:36.936 --> 00:37.771
{\an8}Me and her messed around.

00:37.837 --> 00:38.605
{\an8}So, where do you guys stand now?

00:38.671 --> 00:39.472
{\an8}We're done.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.306
{\an8}Does she know that?

00:40.373 --> 00:41.341
{\an8}We're cool.

00:41.408 --> 00:42.842
{\an8}I'm definitely your
boo and all that.

00:42.909 --> 00:43.910
{\an8}[laughs].

00:43.977 --> 00:45.945
{\an8}She's never going to take
my man from me, period.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.881
{\an8}Grab your stuff and clean out
half of the closet and

00:47.947 --> 00:49.149
{\an8}put your stuff in there.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.451
{\an8}What I want you to do is worry
about getting [bleep] and let me

00:51.518 --> 00:52.652
{\an8}worry about my child.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.487

{\an8}You ain't even got his
name tattooed on you.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.964
{\an8}I would never do that, though.

01:05.031 --> 01:06.466
{\an8}I would never put no
[bleep] tattoo on me.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.735
{\an8}Take your wretched
ass on somewhere.

01:08.802 --> 01:09.903
{\an8}I'm done with you.

01:09.969 --> 01:11.538
{\an8}Why the [bleep] do
you get to talk to me?

01:11.604 --> 01:13.306
{\an8}What the [bleep]
is wrong with you?

01:13.373 --> 01:14.874
{\an8}That's why the [bleep] I
can't be with your ass.

I ain't got no kids, but you

You really ready for that?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.256

03:11.824 --> 03:13.092
Not with a chick, with
a kid, though, you dig?

05:43.543 --> 05:45.378
I know he doesn't care for him.

You know, he was kind of
acting like he was too busy.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.337
Too busy to be with you, but
not too busy to be with others.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.473
Speaking of that, there's a

Who is the girl?

06:21.247 --> 06:22.248
I'll show you pictures.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.349
Oh, you have pictures?

06:23.416 --> 06:24.283
Yes, I have pictures of them.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.818
Let me get my glasses.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.854
I want to see this beauty
that he replaced you by.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.557
Okay, so this was just a couple
days after we broke up,

06:31.624 --> 06:33.459
him and some girl named Masika.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.695
Wow, this is what
she looks like.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.630
Her face is not that cute.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.332
She's whatever, like
she's not that bitch.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.900
It's no match.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.135
You're a diamond.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.970
He replaced you with,
basically, a cubic zirconia,

06:44.036 --> 06:45.471
that's what he did.

06:45.538 --> 06:46.606
A rhinestone, exactly.

06:46.672 --> 06:47.974
The one on my finger,
a rhinestone, exactly.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.909
Exactly.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.879
My mom knows better than anybody
and she knows no bum bitch is

06:52.945 --> 06:54.614
going to take my
place with my man.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.349
It was temporary.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.884
He swore to me
that it was nothing.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.386
That's over and
done with, the end.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.522
I said, "Hey, did
you guys [bleep]?"

07:02.588 --> 07:05.558
And he was like, "Oh, she just
threw herself on me, she woke me

07:05.625 --> 07:08.661
up and she started
[bleep] my [bleep], you know."

07:08.728 --> 07:10.163
I was like, "So, you
didn't want her to do it."

07:10.229 --> 07:12.031
Oh, come on, Nikki, I
didn't raise you to be naive.

07:12.098 --> 07:16.102
If she did [bleep] his
[bleep], that means [bleep].

07:16.169 --> 07:18.371
I don't know what to believe
and I don't want to be lied to.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.673
If you did it, you're a

and I'm not trying to get
in Ray's [bleep] anymore.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.997
But it did get really ugly and I
wanted to apologize about that.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.066
{\an5}Morgan and I have a really
complicated relationship.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.769
{\an5}We were friends when
Ray and I were together.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.804
So, I have love
for her and her son.

16:45.871 --> 16:48.173
But we haven't been able to make
our relationship work since her

16:48.240 --> 16:50.342
boss and I broke up.

16:50.409 --> 16:54.213
I'm at the point right now where
I don't want to continue to have

16:54.279 --> 16:58.117
this energy with you and
this beef over something that

16:58.183 --> 17:00.319
honestly doesn't have
anything to do with me.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.121
The RayJ.com party
shouldn't have happened.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.323
But I'm not going to lie, if I
was put in that situation, it's

17:04.390 --> 17:07.326
possible I would have
acted the same way.

17:07.393 --> 17:09.395
I didn't even know he was going
to be there with another woman.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.463
You have to, hon.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.031
I know that, but why invite me?

17:13.098 --> 17:15.200
Then after that he showed
up to my damn tattoo party.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.069
The way he came
and humiliated me.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.740
I know, but you have got
to stop being violent.

17:21.807 --> 17:26.178
You're a woman and you hitting
him, it's like, what if he

17:26.244 --> 17:27.746
turned around and
really hit you back.

17:27.813 --> 17:28.781
And hit me back, yeah.

17:28.847 --> 17:30.182
And it turns into
this big ass thing.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.984
No matter what he said, I
shouldn't have took it to that

17:32.050 --> 17:34.720
level, because I'm
in the wrong, period.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.788
Yeah.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.222
I'm done playing games.

17:37.289 --> 17:39.458
I just want to move on
in peace with my life.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.960
I just feel like at the end of
the day I don't have time to be

17:42.027 --> 17:46.665
sitting here having beefs with
people that I actually love.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.334
I'm so glad that Morgan invited
me over because, you know,

17:49.401 --> 17:53.739
we're finally in a better
place and we can talk.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.442
And it's good to
have my friend back.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.743
I invited Masika over here.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.644
She should be here any minute.

17:58.710 --> 17:59.812
I have no clue who this girl is.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.547
I know Masika through Hazel.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.949
The other day I
actually talking to Nikki.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.317
I don't know if you
know who she is or not.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.285
Who is that?

18:06.351 --> 18:07.252
That's Mally's girlfriend.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.287
What the hell?

18:08.353 --> 18:10.589
I thought she was
dating him from what I know.

18:10.656 --> 18:14.126
I think there's a lot of
confusion going on and right now

18:14.193 --> 18:15.727
I think I just need
to be the peacemaker.

18:15.794 --> 18:16.762
Are you sure you
want to do that?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.697
Maybe.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.966
Masika was at my tattoo party,
so she seen me at my worst.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.802
I'm kind of happy to focus on
somebody else's drama

18:23.869 --> 18:25.003
for a minute.

18:25.070 --> 18:26.338
This might be fun.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.941
Hey, bitches.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.042
Hi.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.578
Hey, boo.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.746
How you been?

18:34.813 --> 18:37.416
I've been spending a lot of
time with this Mally character.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.517
Cool.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.619
We've just been kicking it.

18:40.686 --> 18:45.657
Okay, I have to ask you,
do you know who Nikki is?

18:45.724 --> 18:48.460
Are you talking about the
Cabbage Patch doll,

18:48.527 --> 18:50.028
the Cabbage Patch.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.130
Mally's girl, I
guess, his girlfriend.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.800
Not according to him.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.034
So, you know a
little bit about her.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.170
Here's the thing, not to cut
you off, but just background.

18:58.237 --> 19:03.041
Basically, PDA, going public,
Mally got me posting all these

19:03.108 --> 19:04.409
pictures of us together.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.445
And at first I was like,
mmm, but now it's kind of cute.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.446
I'll post something.

19:07.513 --> 19:08.947
He'll post
something, a little video.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.449
So, I've been getting a tag.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.817
I didn't even know who she was.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.419
So, I asked him what's going on.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.622
He explained it's
his ex-girlfriend.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.656
Like how long ago?

19:17.723 --> 19:19.224
They broke up a while ago.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.660
So, I'm like, "Why
is she attacking me?"

19:21.727 --> 19:23.195
Either cue it or
keep it on mute.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.596
I'm not the bitch.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.298
He was like, "She was trying to
get back together and I didn't

19:26.365 --> 19:27.833
want to for several reasons."

19:27.900 --> 19:31.003
I feel like since posting that
first picture, it's been hell.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.071
Y'all shouldn't have posted
no pictures with each other.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.306
But he was having you do it.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.707
Posted, tagged.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.142
He was writing the captions.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.444
This is kind of awkward for me
because I definitely do like

19:39.511 --> 19:41.947
both of these girls, but from
the sound of it, Mally's playing

19:42.014 --> 19:44.449
both of them.

19:44.516 --> 19:45.817
It's not cool.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.953
I just feel like her perception
of this whole thing

19:48.020 --> 19:49.922
is completely different.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.490
Like that's her man,
they're supposed to be

19:51.557 --> 19:52.624
moving in together.

19:52.691 --> 19:53.759
She's got a ring.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.260
She never said it was an
engagement ring, she just kept

19:55.327 --> 19:56.862
saying, "He got me this ring."

19:56.929 --> 19:59.031
She definitely told me her and
Mally were broken up for a week

19:59.097 --> 20:00.766
and you like
swooped up in there.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.868
Which week was this
that I swooped in?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.836
Because I didn't swoop
in, I was swooped on.

20:04.903 --> 20:06.705
{\an5}I'm a lot of things, but a
home wrecker is not one of them.

20:06.772 --> 20:12.010
{\an5}Mally Mal was and still is
100% single, according to him.

20:12.077 --> 20:13.312
You know me, I'm the peacemaker.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.846
You're my girl.

20:14.913 --> 20:17.649
I've known Nikki
for a long time.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.751
When her body was
still, uh, eh, uh.

20:19.818 --> 20:24.590
[laughter].

20:24.656 --> 20:26.258
I have pictures from back then.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.392
Let me see.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.361
That's her before.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.096
You are joking.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.498
The bump on this nose, okay.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.634
I want to see the new nose
because it sounds like

20:35.701 --> 20:36.668
it's worth it.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.103
Let me see.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.304
That is not her.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.740
That looks like a
"Jersey Shore" audition tape.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.709
Okay, so that was a little
shady, but the truth is Nikki

20:43.775 --> 20:46.478
has gotten a lot of work done.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.513
Boobs, nose, you
name it, she's done it.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.949
Sorry, Nikki, but seriously I
need to make sure both

20:51.016 --> 20:52.351
girls are in the know.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.920
Seriously, who's
Mally's girl anyways?

20:54.987 --> 20:58.290
I personally think that you two
should meet up and we should try

20:58.357 --> 21:00.058
to hash this thing out because I
really feel like maybe there's

21:00.125 --> 21:03.762
a little confusion
on the Mally part.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.264
I don't feel like it's any of
her business what I'm doing.

21:06.331 --> 21:09.067
But just the simple fact that
you do know her, cool,

21:09.134 --> 21:10.502
we can chat.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.404
But I don't do disrespect.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.640
So, she needs to know,
be pretty, not petty.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.842
So, I know what I'm going to do.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.744
I'm going to have these masseuse
come and give us massages,

21:18.810 --> 21:20.812
get us really relaxed, so that
way there is no tension.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.347
I can't wait.

21:22.414 --> 21:23.582
You just want to come because
you just want to be in

21:23.649 --> 21:24.583
the damn mix.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.751
I just want a massage.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.019
She wants a massage.

21:27.085 --> 21:27.552
With all the [bleep] I've been
through I need a damn massage,

21:27.619 --> 21:28.320
okay.

21:28.387 --> 21:29.187
Oh, God, whatever.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.323
I don't fight, that's not me.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.726
But I will drag a bitch like the
trash she belongs in to the curb

21:34.793 --> 21:38.163
if she gets out of hand.

21:38.230 --> 21:38.964
This is going to be --

21:39.031 --> 21:40.032
Interesting.

21:40.098 --> 21:41.633
Very.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.202
{\an8}Sometimes what you say, it
really comes off like rude.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.570
{\an8}You're not listening to me then,
I'm going to make you

21:45.637 --> 21:46.605
{\an8}listen to me.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.440
{\an8}Why are you
protecting your bitches?

21:48.507 --> 21:49.641
{\an8}You don't like it.

21:49.708 --> 21:50.976
{\an8}I think you're whack.

21:51.043 --> 21:55.414
♪♪

22:04.089 --> 22:05.957
{\an5}I keep hoping that my mom and
Apryl are going to work things

22:06.024 --> 22:08.794
{\an5}out, but that doesn't
seem to be working.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.430
Moms came down pretty hard
on Apryl the last time

22:11.496 --> 22:13.031
we got together.

22:13.098 --> 22:14.599
So, today I'm spending some
alone time with moms so

22:14.666 --> 22:17.269
I can see if I can get to
the bottom of this.

22:17.335 --> 22:18.537
Oh, my goodness.

22:18.603 --> 22:20.639
That's that
wheatgrass, it'll clean you out.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.240
It tastes like grass, like
I've been chewing on

22:22.307 --> 22:24.242
the grass outside.

22:24.309 --> 22:25.544
You know I want you to be
healthy, you know

22:25.610 --> 22:26.678
what I'm saying?

22:26.745 --> 22:27.679
Yes.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.081
Mom, you got to be around.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.416
This has been going on
for a good ten years now.

22:31.483 --> 22:32.984
Me and my seizures
and stuff like that.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.254
I never got used to it,
I'm still not used to it.

22:36.321 --> 22:38.590
{\an5}I started having
seizures seven years ago.

22:38.657 --> 22:41.760
They were brought on by stress
and I take medication every day

22:41.827 --> 22:43.395
to control them.

22:43.462 --> 22:46.431
I believe over the
years they've gotten worse.

22:46.498 --> 22:50.368
I don't think everybody
takes it as seriously as it

22:50.435 --> 22:51.837
truly really is.

22:51.903 --> 22:55.474
Sometimes I put on a face that
I'm okay, but I'm not feeling as

22:55.540 --> 22:57.509
good as you think I look.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.912
I wanted to talk to you about,
um, you know, the last time

23:00.979 --> 23:02.414
we came to the house.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.449
Uh huh.

23:04.516 --> 23:07.619
And it didn't really go so well.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.222
People don't listen sometimes,
and if you're not listening

23:10.288 --> 23:12.190
to me, then I'm going to
make you listen to me.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.092
That made her listen, didn't it?

23:14.159 --> 23:16.728
No, not really, it hurt
her feelings more so.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.096
I didn't mean to hurt her
feelings, but I didn't like

23:18.163 --> 23:20.232
where she was coming from.

23:20.298 --> 23:21.833
Well, I'm going to be
honest with you, mom.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.502
I understand you and
I know who you are.

23:23.568 --> 23:26.805
But it's like sometimes what you
say, it really comes off rude

23:26.872 --> 23:29.775
and obnoxious and aggressive,
you know what I'm saying, mom?

23:29.841 --> 23:33.612
For the sake of everything
that's working out, like

23:33.678 --> 23:35.313
because I really love Apryl.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.282
I want that to work,
mom, you know what I mean?

23:37.349 --> 23:39.217
How old was I when
I first had you?

23:39.284 --> 23:40.619
16.

23:40.685 --> 23:44.022
Okay, so she already got over
ten years on me and I didn't

23:44.089 --> 23:46.625
have no good man
like you helping me.

23:46.691 --> 23:47.826
Word.

23:47.893 --> 23:50.162
Okay, so see, she
has a big advantage.

23:50.228 --> 23:54.533
So, it's not like I feel
like she's taking away from me

23:54.599 --> 23:56.668
because you been
taking care of me.

23:56.735 --> 24:00.105
We had a certain regiment
and then it just stopped.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.606
Yeah.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.308
And I'm like, "What happened?"

24:03.375 --> 24:05.577
And then when I say, "What
happened", it come off as I'm

24:05.644 --> 24:08.914
being snotty about
it and I wasn't.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.016
There's adjustments that are
going to have to be made because

24:11.082 --> 24:13.552
now I have to support a child.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.420
This arrangement
didn't come about until I

24:15.487 --> 24:17.389
started having seizures.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.790
I don't want all this on you.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.058
Okay.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.893
I just want you to understand
that I'm in a position to where

24:21.960 --> 24:24.329
it's like I need help.

24:24.396 --> 24:27.132
It kills me that I have to
ask my child to help me.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.734
If I can change the
situation, I would.

24:29.801 --> 24:33.138
But ever since I got
sick, I have no choice.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.340
You know, I'm glad we had the
opportunity to sit down and, you

24:35.407 --> 24:39.544
know, talk because I wanted to
invite you to the baby shower.

24:39.611 --> 24:43.081

32:55.440 --> 32:57.809
I really am.

32:57.875 --> 32:59.944
{\an5}One thing we definitely need to
be clear on is there can't be

33:00.011 --> 33:03.348
{\an5}people in and out of the house
at different times all day.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.184
Dre really wants me and Cam,
or he wants his entourage.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.886
He definitely can't
have it both ways.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.725
What do you normally
do when you're on tour?

33:13.791 --> 33:15.727
Getting money.

33:15.793 --> 33:17.028
And what else?

33:17.095 --> 33:18.529
What you want me to say,
I'm [bleep] bitches on tour?

33:18.596 --> 33:19.864
Yeah, that would be nice.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.367
Did I just call you every
single day when I was in Texas,

33:22.433 --> 33:24.702
FaceTime you every
day when I was gone?

33:24.769 --> 33:26.771
Don't turn it.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.306
Don't start.

33:28.373 --> 33:31.008
I've been on tour with my
dad and I know what he does.

33:31.075 --> 33:32.143
And he's not a rapper.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.612
I'm for sure rappers are worse.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.547
When my mom and dad were
together and he was on the road

33:36.614 --> 33:38.683
with Guy and Blackstreet,
I'm pretty sure he wasn't a

33:38.750 --> 33:40.251
one-woman man.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.487
My dad has nine kids with six
different women and I'm not

33:42.553 --> 33:45.323
trying to live that life.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.792
You make it sound like I'm going
to cheat on you or I'm fixing to

33:47.859 --> 33:49.193
be smashing with groupies.

33:49.260 --> 33:50.561
You're comparing me to
what your father did.

33:50.628 --> 33:51.796
I'm not saying that.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.332
Can I finish?

33:54.399 --> 33:57.869
I'm not your father, but at the
end of the day I get why you may

33:57.935 --> 34:00.671
feel that way, because he
did what he did or whatever.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.306
But this is different though.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.343

your pops is your pops.

around when he was on the road.

And I'm afraid those
things will happen again.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.223

I'm going to do my best to trust

35:54.585 --> 35:56.487
But by the looks of Masika,
I don't know what

35:56.554 --> 35:57.955
Mally was thinking.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.024
Did he pick up this ho
on the corner somewhere?

36:00.091 --> 36:02.927
There's simply no
comparison over here.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.829
You know, I don't understand
what's going on with

36:04.896 --> 36:06.697
you and Mall.

36:06.764 --> 36:09.367
Maybe he fed you something, or
maybe you thought something,

36:09.433 --> 36:10.935
so let's just get it clear.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.136
I've been with him
for a year and a half.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.204
I'm his woman.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.572
We were about to
move in a house.

36:14.639 --> 36:15.873
I have a ring from him.

36:15.940 --> 36:16.707
So, I don't know if you
understand the severity

36:16.774 --> 36:17.642
of our relationship.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.243
I just don't know
what's going on.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.712
See, this is like
Chinese that I don't speak.

36:21.779 --> 36:24.248
Because he's saying
something completely different.

36:24.315 --> 36:28.019
But considering he's your man
and saying he's my man too,

36:28.085 --> 36:30.721
it does make it a
bit interesting.

36:30.788 --> 36:32.356
So, you still think
right now he's your man.

36:32.423 --> 36:33.357
That's what he says.

36:33.424 --> 36:34.292
No.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.860
According to my
phone, my picture.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.995
According to my phone,
you are not his woman.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.464
And that's vice versa.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.933
When I'm listening to Masika say
that Mally is her man,

36:41.999 --> 36:44.302
I'm just looking at her
like she's crazy.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.536
Everything she's saying is going
in this ear and out

36:45.603 --> 36:46.604
the other one.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.139
Me and Mall, we broke up.

36:48.205 --> 36:49.206
A couple of days later I see
pictures of you laying in

36:49.273 --> 36:50.808
the bed with his cat.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.543
I'm thinking
you're a home wrecker.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.011
And you would too.

36:54.078 --> 36:55.046
But how would I be a home
wrecker if you say you

36:55.112 --> 36:56.213
were broken up.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.548
Because you don't waste no time.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.317
Everybody knows that
man belongs to me.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.985
That's why people
tagged me in your photo.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.621
No.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.289
He posted the pictures on my
phone, tagged himself and

37:05.356 --> 37:06.490
wrote the captions.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.192
I can vouch for that
because I've heard that too.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.962
I would love to believe you,
but my loyalty is with him.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.237
{\an8}Morgan is just phony to me.

40:06.303 --> 40:07.772
{\an8}I'm going to provide some
dancers for Ray J's shoot,

40:07.838 --> 40:10.207
{\an8}so I know exactly how I feel.

40:10.274 --> 40:15.212
{\an8}What you did totally seemed
vague to me, or some hater.

40:15.279 --> 40:16.280
{\an8}In my eyes what I think.

40:16.347 --> 40:17.848
{\an8}Act like a professional.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.216
{\an8}I get it.

40:19.283 --> 40:21.285
{\an8}Please, don't do that here.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.988
{\an8}I'm sick of being loyal to
people who are not loyal to me.

40:24.054 --> 40:27.191
{\an8}have you ever thought about
separating yourself from Ray

40:27.258 --> 40:28.592
{\an8}and venturing on your own?

40:28.659 --> 40:30.528
{\an8}I'm thinking I do.

40:30.594 --> 40:35.332
{\an8}I just want to know if we start
to work and Hazel gets mad,

40:35.399 --> 40:37.501
{\an8}you're not going to
backtrack and change your mind.

40:37.568 --> 40:39.537
{\an8}I stay out of [bleep] business.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.305
{\an8}I'm about to call Teairra
up about doing some

40:41.372 --> 40:42.673
{\an8}records together.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.941
{\an8}Really?

40:44.008 --> 40:46.277
{\an8}You like making me look like a
fool and all I'm doing is being

40:46.343 --> 40:49.613
{\an8}down for you and you can't
[bleep] do the same for me.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.315
{\an8}I don't like the way
you're talking to me.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.384
{\an8}I'm just trying to figure
out what kind of game

40:53.450 --> 40:54.518
{\an8}you're playing.

40:54.585 --> 40:55.886
{\an8}Oh, we have company today.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.022
{\an8}Oh, this is clown.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.791
{\an8}You told me you [bleep] my
man, did you [bleep] her.

41:00.858 --> 41:01.959
{\an8}No.

41:02.026 --> 41:02.993
{\an8}You've proven
that you're a liar.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.228
{\an8}You've just proven that.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.529
{\an8}Don't [bleep].

41:05.596 --> 41:09.166
{\an8}I swear to God,
don't touch me, bitch.
