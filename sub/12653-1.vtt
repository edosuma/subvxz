Well, I Think I'm
Actually Finished.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.134
So This Is It, Huh?

00:33.167 --> 00:38.341
Yeah. Malcolm, We're Finally Gonna
Be Able To Change The World.

00:40.576 --> 00:42.945
And They're Not Gonna Be
Able To Do Anything About It.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.849
Scott Marshall Has The Ball.

00:47.883 --> 00:49.417
He Fakes Right.

00:49.451 --> 00:50.518
Left.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.153
He's Almost In The Clear.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.756
Will He... Will He...

00:55.189 --> 00:56.091
Ooh!

00:58.793 --> 01:00.428
Dad, Are You
All Right?

01:00.462 --> 01:03.365
I'm... Fine.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.435
Nothing Like A Concussion
Before Breakfast

01:06.468 --> 01:08.137
To Make You Feel Alive.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.605
Sorry. I Was Practicing.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.973
We Have A Game Today.

01:12.007 --> 01:15.743
Who Can Be Mad At A Kid
Who's Got A Birthday

01:15.777 --> 01:17.846
In Four Days?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.551
Four Days.

01:24.453 --> 01:27.689
Adam! Scott! Molly! Jim!

01:27.722 --> 01:28.990
Right Here.

01:29.024 --> 01:30.292
Sorry, Honey.

01:30.325 --> 01:33.262
It's Ok. I'm Hearing A Lot
Of That This Morning.

01:33.295 --> 01:36.198
Mom, My Retainer Fell
In The Toilet Again.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.932
Well, Maybe You Should
Stop Drinking Out Of It.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.467
I Wasn't Drinking
Out Of It!

01:39.501 --> 01:40.736
Don't Tease Your Sister.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.471
Adam, Get Down Here!

01:42.504 --> 01:45.274
And They Say Teenage Girls Spend
Too Much Time In Front Of The Mirror.

01:45.307 --> 01:47.308
Dad, About My Party
On Sunday...

01:47.341 --> 01:50.111
Oh, That Reminds Me. I Have
To Order A Larger Cake.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.579
Seems Like The Whole
World Is Coming.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.549
Chocolate With White
Icing, Right?

01:53.581 --> 01:54.782
Right.

01:54.816 --> 01:56.418
Hey, Scooter, Four More Days!

01:56.450 --> 01:58.419
Is There Anymore Milk?

01:58.453 --> 02:00.356
I Don't Know. We Were Just
Talking About The Party.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.324
Oh, Man, It's Gonna
Be A Total Blow-Out.

02:03.358 --> 02:05.860
I Can't Wait. Oh, I Almost
Forgot. You Lose Something?

02:05.894 --> 02:07.329
Oh, Gross!

02:07.361 --> 02:08.963
Adam!
Adam!

02:08.997 --> 02:11.200
Hey. Good Morning,
Marshalls.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.806
Uh, Hey, Randy.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.143
Good Morning.

02:21.175 --> 02:25.381
Ah, What Ya Got There?

02:25.413 --> 02:27.382
Zucchini Bread.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.286
My Mom Made It.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.254
Just Put It On The Table.

02:33.288 --> 02:34.457
Right There.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.825
Yeah.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.131
C'mon, Randy. I Think We
Better Get Out Of Here Now.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.199
Enjoy.

02:44.233 --> 02:47.203
Have Fun At School.
I'll See You, Randy.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.038
Thanks, Dad. Bye,
Everybody.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.182
Can I Make An
Observation?

03:01.216 --> 03:03.953
Your Family Is
Totally Whacked.

03:03.985 --> 03:06.287
We're All Really
Allergic To Zucchini.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.790
Lucky. I'm Lactose
Intolerant.

03:10.092 --> 03:11.727
You Know, You Should Try
Punching Her In The Arm

03:11.759 --> 03:12.995
And Then Running Away.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.829
I Hear Girls Really
Go For That Thing.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.931
I Don't Like Her, Ok?

03:15.963 --> 03:17.699
Louder. I Don't
Think She Heard You.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.703
Hey, Marshall.

03:20.735 --> 03:22.637
Still Think You Got A Chance

03:22.670 --> 03:24.439
Of Being Team Captain
After Yesterday's Game?

03:24.473 --> 03:26.875
I've Got A Better
Chance Than You Do.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.176
Yeah, Right.

03:28.210 --> 03:30.246
I Don't Think Anybody's
Voting For The Choke King.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.680
I Can Outshoot You
Any Day, Rosen.

03:32.713 --> 03:33.949
Wanna Bet?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.586
My Lunch Money's On
The Pigtails.

03:39.354 --> 03:40.656
Ha! Missed!

03:40.688 --> 03:42.590
No. She Didn't.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.658
Ow.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.199
Oh, Man.

03:52.234 --> 03:54.069
Amy, If You Like
Scott That Much,

03:54.102 --> 03:55.871
Why Don't You Just Ask
Him To The Dance?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.539
Mom, Please. I Don't
Like Him, Ok?

03:58.573 --> 03:59.942
Not Much.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.245
I'll Go Get My Soccer Ball.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.816
I Just Thought That, Uh,

04:07.848 --> 04:10.118
If We Didn't Pressure
Him About His Birthday,

04:10.151 --> 04:12.453
It Would Be
Easier On Him.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.822
If I Ever Thought
This Might Happen,

04:14.855 --> 04:17.058
I Never Would Have Made Such
A Big Deal Out Of The Party.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.594
Oh, Don't Forget You're
Soccer Mom Today.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.228
I Have A Trustees
Meeting.

04:21.262 --> 04:25.266
I've Already Rearranged My Schedule.
2:45 In Front Of The School.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.036
Ok.

04:27.069 --> 04:29.237
And, Sweetie, Will
You Hurry Up?

04:29.271 --> 04:32.275
Just Being Near This Stuff
Makes Me Weak In The Knees.

04:40.382 --> 04:41.516
Such A Shame.

04:41.550 --> 04:43.752
I Really Love
Zucchini Bread.

04:46.521 --> 04:48.524
Settle. Everyone, Settle.

04:48.557 --> 04:50.859
Now, I'd Like To
Introduce To You

Eighth Grade, Mr. Quinn.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.614
All: Good.

05:13.648 --> 05:15.317
Good. That's Good.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.486
Today I'm Gonna Talk To You Guys
A Little Bit About The Environment,

05:17.519 --> 05:19.288
And I'm Gonna Hand
Out A Few Upgrades.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.424
I Hope You're Gonna
Recycle That.

05:23.524 --> 05:24.759
Please?

05:24.793 --> 05:26.495
Uh-Huh.

05:26.528 --> 05:28.697
Good Girl.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.400
Now, We've Designed The Software
That Goes Into The Computers

05:31.432 --> 05:33.201
To Be Fun, As Well
As Educational.

05:33.235 --> 05:36.504
Randy: Something Tells Me This Is Not A Video Game.

05:36.538 --> 05:39.475
They Can Disguise It
Anyway They Want,

05:39.507 --> 05:41.409
It's Still Homework.

05:43.512 --> 05:45.012
How Are You Guys Doing?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.016
Keep Up The Good Work.
You'll Be An Earth Protector One Day.

05:48.817 --> 05:51.220
Recycle Those, Guys.
I'm Serious.

05:51.252 --> 05:52.320
We Will.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.955
C'mon, Now. Have
Fun At School Today.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.937
Man, I Hate Kids!

06:09.971 --> 06:13.309
Can't We Just Run Tests On
Rats, Like Everybody Else?

06:15.043 --> 06:17.278
We Just Finished The Pineland Bank Download, Boss.

06:17.312 --> 06:18.713
We Better Get Moving.
We're Gonna Be Late.

06:18.747 --> 06:19.948
Where's Nina?

06:19.980 --> 06:21.082
She's At The Warehouse.

06:21.115 --> 06:22.283
She's Not Expecting
Us For Hours.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.086
Perfect.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.057
Now We'll See What This Little
Program Of Hers Can Really Do.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.334
Yeah, They Gave Us Computers.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.637
But Every Night We Have To
Download These Stupid Programs

06:42.670 --> 06:45.507
On Recycling, You Know, And
Planting Trees And Junk.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.444
You Guys Don't Know How Lucky You
Are To Have Your Own Computers.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.711
When I Was Your Age--

06:50.745 --> 06:51.814
Yeah, Mr. Marshall,
Tell Us.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.882
How Was It Using A
Hammer And Chisel?

06:55.684 --> 06:58.654
Well, If You Don't Mind Waiting For Just A Moment, Sir,

06:58.687 --> 07:00.889
I'd Be More Than Happy To
Access Your Account For You.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.727
Ah, Here You Are.

07:06.761 --> 07:12.067
Oh, I'm Showing That You Have $1.37 In Your Account.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.403
Do You Want That In
Nickles And Dimes?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.572
No. That's, Uh,
That's Impossible.

07:16.605 --> 07:18.674
I Have A Lot Of Money
In This Bank, Ok?

07:18.706 --> 07:20.608
Is There A Problem Here?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.577
Yes. There Is
A Problem.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.947
I Have Money In This Bank.
He's Telling Me I Don't.

07:24.980 --> 07:26.747
There Must Be Some Kind Of A
Problem With The Computer.

07:26.781 --> 07:30.953
Look, Do Me A Favor And Just
Look Again For Me, Please?

07:30.985 --> 07:32.420
Sure.

All The Thinking For You.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.843

[Sneezes]

08:14.329 --> 08:15.898
What's Going On?

08:15.930 --> 08:18.966
Security!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.735
Security!

08:20.769 --> 08:23.338
[Pager Beeping]

08:23.370 --> 08:26.407
Do You Guys Mind If I Let
You Off At The Corner?

08:26.440 --> 08:28.643
I've Got An Emergency
At The Office.

08:28.677 --> 08:31.279
What's The Emergency? You're
An Orthodontist, Right?

08:31.312 --> 08:34.115
What, Two Losers Get Their
Braces Stuck Together?

08:34.149 --> 08:36.384
Dad, Is Something
Wrong With The Car?

08:36.418 --> 08:39.754
Uh, Yeah.
I Think Something Is Wrong With The Car.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.856
Let Me Pull Over
Here At The Corner.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.625
Why Does This Always Happen When Your Dad Drives?

08:49.965 --> 08:51.767
C'mon, Scott. Hurry Up.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.536
You Know They're Picking Team Captain Today.

08:56.037 --> 08:57.706
I'll Catch Up.

09:00.609 --> 09:02.478
Excuse Me A Moment.

09:09.618 --> 09:11.086
All Clear, Dad.

09:11.119 --> 09:13.654
Sorry About This, Son.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.624
But Have A Great Game.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.730
Up, Up And Away!

09:28.503 --> 09:30.739

09:49.658 --> 09:50.959
Well, It's About Time.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.193
Did You Walk Here?

09:54.162 --> 09:55.663
Honey...

09:55.697 --> 09:57.164
I Had A Van Full Of Kids.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.100
And I Had A Room
Full Of Trustees.

09:59.134 --> 10:01.702
Didn't You Hear Me When I Said I
Had An Important Meeting Today?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.438
I Swear, You're Always
Doing This To Me.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.777
Honey, What Do You Want
Me To Say? I Tried.

10:14.416 --> 10:18.920
Look. You Told Me To Pick
'Em Up At 2:45. I Did.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.122
Sometimes I Don't Feel Like
You Take What I Do Seriously.

10:21.155 --> 10:22.957
I Totally Appreciate
You, Honey.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.159
Maybe You Could Show
It Once In A While.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.962
Honey, Today... Ok, I
Made A Mistake.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.597
But You Know How I Feel.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.399
I'm Always Soccer Mom For You.

10:31.432 --> 10:32.668
Just Get Here
On Time.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.472

Are Super Mom.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.041

10:55.222 --> 10:58.159
Say, Honey,
Would This Be A Bad Time To Talk About The Laundry?

10:58.192 --> 11:01.129
Oh, Don't Make Me Pluck
Your Tail Feathers.

11:02.263 --> 11:03.965
See You At Home,
Eagle Boy.

11:03.998 --> 11:05.300
Yes, Honey.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.836
Drive Careful. Put
Your Helmet On.

11:08.870 --> 11:09.804
Fasten It Up.

11:16.878 --> 11:18.881
That's My Wife.

11:19.581 --> 11:21.283
Up, Up And Away!

11:24.251 --> 11:27.521
I Was In Line, Just
Waiting To Cash My Check,

11:27.554 --> 11:30.125
And Everybody Started
Screaming And Yelling.

11:30.158 --> 11:31.960
I Didn't Really See Too
Much Of It, Actually.

11:33.595 --> 11:35.596
But I Know That It's A Good
Thing That Those Guys Showed Up.

11:35.629 --> 11:38.399
'Cause I Don't Think That Anybody
Else Is Gonna Be Able To Stop 'Em.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.934
Certainly Not Me, Anyway.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.083
We'll See Who's
The Best Shooter.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.551
We'll See Who's
The Best Shooter.

11:57.585 --> 11:58.552
Pass The
Ball To Amy!

11:58.586 --> 12:00.788
Scott, C'mon! Amy's Open! C'mon!

12:00.822 --> 12:02.390
We'll See Who's
The Best Shooter.

12:07.162 --> 12:09.464
Well, At Least You've Got A
Career In Field Goal Kicking.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.966
Yeah, You're Gonna Be
Team Captain, All Right.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.101
Pass It Next Time.

C'mon, Scott! C'mon, Randy!

12:21.509 --> 12:23.245
Hey, Dad.

12:23.278 --> 12:24.446
I Wish You Wouldn't Do That.

12:24.479 --> 12:25.747
Somebody's Gonna See
You One Of These Days.

12:25.779 --> 12:29.350
Relax. I Zip Around At
Nearly The Speed Of Light.

12:29.384 --> 12:30.885
Nobody's Gonna See Me.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.920
And If They Do...

12:32.953 --> 12:36.657
I'll Just Fry A Couple Of
Brain Cells, Baby. Whooo!

12:38.826 --> 12:41.263
Man, I Can't Believe I Missed
The Bank Robbery This Afternoon.

12:41.296 --> 12:43.298
Well, Somehow We
Managed Without You.

12:43.331 --> 12:45.332
And Can You Do
Me A Favor?

12:45.365 --> 12:46.735
Keep It A Little Low-Key
Around Your Brother

12:46.768 --> 12:47.836
For The Next Few Days.

12:47.869 --> 12:49.271
Why?

12:49.303 --> 12:50.704
I Mean, He's Gonna Be
Getting His Powers

12:50.738 --> 12:51.773
Any Day Now, Right?

12:51.806 --> 12:54.576
Well, The Closer
It Gets To Sunday,

12:54.609 --> 12:56.211
It Doesn't Look Likely.

12:56.244 --> 12:57.579
But I Didn't Start
To Get My Powers

12:57.611 --> 12:58.846
Until A Couple Of Weeks
Before My Big 1-4.

13:01.416 --> 13:03.518
You Mean...

13:03.551 --> 13:06.021
Scott Might Be...

13:06.053 --> 13:07.755
Normal?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.658
Yeah.

13:10.692 --> 13:12.427
Yeah. Scott Might Be Normal.

13:16.663 --> 13:19.533
A Bank Robbery!
What Were You Thinking, Malcolm?

13:19.567 --> 13:20.969
You Could Have Destroyed Everything.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.636
I'll Tell You What
I Was Thinking.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.272
I Was Thinking That
Somebody's Got To Pay

13:25.306 --> 13:26.908
For This Little
Scheme Of Yours.

13:26.941 --> 13:29.945
Besides, There's Nothing
Left To Destroy, Ok?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.413
Your Stupid Program
Didn't Even Work.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.983
Of Course It Didn't Work.

13:36.017 --> 13:38.787
It's Specifically Designed To
Work On Adolescent Brains.

13:38.820 --> 13:40.055
Oh.

13:45.626 --> 13:47.495
I'm Sorry I Said
That, Nina.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.230
I Didn't
Know That.

13:50.899 --> 13:53.768
It's Just That-- I Mean,
After You're Done Running All Your Tests,

13:53.801 --> 13:56.605
How Are We Supposed To Get One Of
These To Every Kid In The Country?

13:59.740 --> 14:02.977
I Don't Know. I Hadn't... I
Hadn't Thought That Far.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.847
Exactly. That's
Why I'm Here.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.221
Hey, Honey. You
Still Mad At Me?

14:13.254 --> 14:15.590
Huh? Huh?

14:15.623 --> 14:18.593
No. You're Forgiven.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.194
You Ok With Burgers
On The Grill?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.762
Yeah. I'm Fine.

14:21.796 --> 14:24.967
I'll Light It Just
As Soon As...

14:26.433 --> 14:29.471
Oh. Somebody Used
Her Laser Vision

14:29.504 --> 14:31.373
To Play Forest
Fire With My Lily.

14:31.405 --> 14:33.707
Oh.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.742
Uh-Huh.

14:34.775 --> 14:37.177
[Watch Beeping]
Ok. Time's Up.

14:37.211 --> 14:38.846
You Want To Help
Daddy Out?

14:38.879 --> 14:42.484
Why Don't You Go Light
The Barbecue Grill?

14:42.517 --> 14:43.619
Ok!

14:45.485 --> 14:47.088
Adam, Could You
Please Set The--

14:51.960 --> 14:53.061
Done.

14:54.962 --> 14:58.165
Man, Mom Really Kicked
Some Serious Butt.

15:01.302 --> 15:04.438
<I>...Once Again Proved
That Crime Does Not Pay.

15:04.471 --> 15:08.742
<I>They Successfully Apprehended
Three Robbery Suspects...

15:08.775 --> 15:10.544
Honey, We've Got To Get
Some New Head Shots.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.279
Photographer Called
Yesterday.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.350
Is Your Brother
In His Room?

15:15.383 --> 15:19.054
Yeah... You Know,
None Of The Tellers

15:19.086 --> 15:20.587
Can Remember What Happened.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.557
They Just Handed
Over The Money.

15:22.590 --> 15:25.125
I Mean, No Guns,
No Note, Nothing.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.830
Maybe They Were Using Some
Kind Of Mind-Control Device.

15:28.863 --> 15:32.534
I Hope We're Not Dealing With
Some New Criminal Mastermind.

15:32.567 --> 15:33.969
Can I Take Him
Out, Please?

15:34.001 --> 15:34.935
Come On.

15:34.969 --> 15:36.504
You Know The Rules--

15:36.537 --> 15:38.105
No Crime Fighting Until You've Done Your Homework,
Young Man.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.914
Hey! If You Melt The Patio
Furniture Again, Young Lady,

15:46.947 --> 15:48.350
You're In A Lot Of Trouble.

15:49.850 --> 15:51.519
[Knocking]

15:51.552 --> 15:53.021
Oh, Hey, Son.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.221
Hey, Dad.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.889
Great Game Today.

15:55.923 --> 15:57.826
Oh, It Wasn't
So Great.

15:57.859 --> 15:59.494
What Do You Mean?

15:59.527 --> 16:01.796
Eleven Steals,
Three Assists--

16:01.828 --> 16:03.597
That's Pretty
Impressive In My Book.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.600
Yeah, But I Missed That Goal.

16:06.634 --> 16:08.669
Maybe You Were A Little Off

16:08.702 --> 16:12.039
Because You Got A Little
Super Strength Coming On?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.875
No, I Was A Little Off
Because I'm The Choke King.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.211
Well, At Least
You're The King.

16:19.047 --> 16:21.383
You Know, Your Mother
And I Have Been Thinking

16:21.416 --> 16:23.785
About A Name For You.

16:23.817 --> 16:28.155
And What Do You Think
About "The Destroyer"?

16:29.990 --> 16:31.592
The Destroyer?

16:33.528 --> 16:35.897
Kind Of Pro-Wrestling, Dad.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.965
Ok. Ok.

16:37.999 --> 16:41.503
But, Dad, Does Anybody Ever
Get Their Super Powers

16:41.535 --> 16:43.771
After Their 14th Birthday?

16:43.804 --> 16:45.439
No.

16:46.441 --> 16:48.343
I'm Afraid Not.

16:48.375 --> 16:51.446
I'm Not Gonna Be A
Superhero, Am I?

16:51.479 --> 16:53.114
What Makes You Say That?

16:53.147 --> 16:56.951
I Mean, You Still Have
Three Whole Days Left.

16:56.984 --> 16:59.521
You Know, There's
Tons Of Superheros

16:59.553 --> 17:02.123
That Didn't Get Their Powers Until The Day Before.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.290
Really?

17:03.324 --> 17:08.329
Yeah. Flame Guy, Rocket
Man, Jello Girl.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.265
So There's Still Time!

17:10.298 --> 17:13.733
Uh, Yeah. Definitely.

17:16.671 --> 17:18.906
Molly, If I've Told You Once,
I've Told You A Million Times--

17:18.940 --> 17:20.741
No Laser Vision
Without Supervision!

17:20.775 --> 17:22.509
Now, Upstairs! Now!

17:22.541 --> 17:25.112
And No Spinach Ice Cream For
You Tonight, Young Lady.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.380
Mom!

17:26.413 --> 17:27.580
Don't Make Me Take Away
Your Broccoli Pudding.

17:27.615 --> 17:29.084
It's Not Fair!

17:29.116 --> 17:32.053
And If You Never Develop
Laser Vision, I'll Be Happy.

17:41.295 --> 17:43.031
I'm Gonna Be The Best
Superhero Ever.

17:43.064 --> 17:45.033
Just Like My Dad.

17:46.767 --> 17:47.302
Are You In Yet?

17:47.335 --> 17:48.870
Almost.

17:48.903 --> 17:51.639
There.

17:51.672 --> 17:55.043
County Jail.
Access Granted.

17:55.076 --> 17:59.447
Unfortunately, Now We Have A
Herd Of Rabid Superheros

17:59.480 --> 18:00.815
Out Looking For Us.

18:00.847 --> 18:04.184
What? Why Would They
Care About Us?

18:04.218 --> 18:05.120
You Didn't Even
Get Any Money.

18:05.153 --> 18:08.256
Please. Don't Remind Me.

18:10.458 --> 18:14.362
Malcolm, We Can't
Let 'Em Stop Us.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.632
I Mean,
We Are So Close To Really Helping The Planet.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.134
Don't Worry, Nina.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.801
They're Not Gonna Be
Able To Stop Us.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.771
Of Course,
It Would Be Easier If We Knew Where They Were.

18:24.805 --> 18:29.744
I'm Sure They Have Some Fabulous,
High-Tech Secret Lair Somewhere.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.645
What Do You Mean,
You Told Him There's Still Time?

18:31.679 --> 18:34.249
Well, Honey, Technically
There Is Still Time.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.350
Jim, He's Got To Face
Reality Sooner Or Later.

18:36.384 --> 18:37.919
We All Do.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.653
I'm Canceling
That Party.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.122
He'll Be Humiliated.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.657
Honey, Just One More Day.

18:43.691 --> 18:46.760
And Then We Can
Cancel The Party.

18:46.794 --> 18:49.030
Who's More Disappointed,
Him Or You?

18:49.063 --> 18:51.232
Honey, That's
Not Fair.

18:51.265 --> 18:54.969
You're Just Disappointed Because
You Can't Brag To Your Buddies.

18:55.001 --> 18:59.473
Honey, You Want Him To Be A
Superhero Just As Much As I Do.

18:59.507 --> 19:02.677
I Just Always Thought Scott Would
Go Into The Family Business.

19:02.710 --> 19:04.812
Yeah, Well, He's Not.

19:04.845 --> 19:07.981
Honey, All He Really Needs
Is A Glimpse Of Some Power

19:08.015 --> 19:09.751
For Us To Have That Party.

19:09.784 --> 19:12.820
Super Strength,
X-Ray Vision...

19:12.853 --> 19:15.690
If He Could Morph Like His Grandmother,
I'd Be Happy.

19:25.833 --> 19:29.137
Oh, Dad, Can I Just
Take That, Please?

19:29.170 --> 19:30.104
Why? Don't You Think
I Can Handle It?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.638
No. It's Not That...

19:31.672 --> 19:32.941
I'll Have You Know I
Was Lifting Redwoods

19:32.973 --> 19:34.341
Like They Were
Lincoln Logs

19:34.375 --> 19:35.910
Long Before You Were Born.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.110
I Was Afraid That--

19:37.144 --> 19:38.346
That It's Too Heavy?

19:38.378 --> 19:39.446
I Lifted Up The Cadillac
The Other Day

19:39.480 --> 19:41.615
With Just One Hand.
Ask Your Mother.

19:43.384 --> 19:47.488
...I Was Afraid That The
Bottom Was Gonna Fall Out.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.257
Well, Why Didn't
You Say That?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.825
You Take Care Of That.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.359
I Gotta Go Say Hi
To My Grandkids.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.029
You Know Your Father.

19:57.131 --> 19:58.233
Hey, Grandpa!

20:07.107 --> 20:09.411
Super Strength!

20:11.878 --> 20:13.413
Just Kinda Started.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.282
Scott, That's
Wonderful!

20:15.316 --> 20:18.486
Did You See That? He Ripped
It Right Off The Hinges!

20:18.519 --> 20:19.854
What Did I Tell You?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.255
One More Day.

20:23.190 --> 20:25.093
When Your Father Went
Through This Phase,

20:25.125 --> 20:26.860
We Had To Put A New
Foundation On The House.

20:26.894 --> 20:28.963
Sorry About That, Mama.

20:30.298 --> 20:31.932
That Is So Cool, Scott!

20:31.965 --> 20:33.700
I Want To See You
Do Something.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.069
Juggle The Piano.

20:36.103 --> 20:38.105
Oh, It Kinda
Comes And Goes.

20:38.138 --> 20:40.240
He Can Show Off
After Dinner.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.776
Have Some More
Spinach, Honey.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.778
You Have Your Super
Strength To Maintain.

20:44.811 --> 20:48.649
Oh, We Had Spiderman And Mary
Jane Over For Dinner Last Night.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.286
They Say Hi.

20:51.318 --> 20:54.254
Any Idea How To Take Webs
Out Of The Carpet?

20:54.288 --> 20:58.226
Ha. Ice And Club Soda.
They Come Right Up.

20:58.259 --> 21:01.062
Hmmm. This Is Some Good
Spinach Casserole.

21:03.497 --> 21:05.033
What Do You Make Of That
Bank Robbery Yesterday, Jim?

21:05.066 --> 21:07.101
Kind Of Unusual.

21:07.134 --> 21:08.502
It Has Me Concerned.

21:08.536 --> 21:12.140
I Think We Might Be In
For A Major Crime Wave.

21:12.173 --> 21:14.208
Don't Even Worry
About It.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.644
Scooter Here Can Pick
Up The Slack, Baby.

21:17.678 --> 21:20.048
Oh, No. I Don't Think So.

21:20.080 --> 21:21.548
A Little Super Strength--

21:21.582 --> 21:23.017
Uh-Uh. He's Not About To Go Out
And Face Hardened Criminals.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.720
He Was Trying To Fly
This Afternoon.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.425
Did You? Did You
Try To Fly?

21:34.194 --> 21:35.896
Maybe A Little.

21:35.930 --> 21:36.764
Did Not.

21:36.797 --> 21:37.832
Molly!

21:37.865 --> 21:40.067
Scott, That's Fantastic.

21:40.101 --> 21:41.869
Honey, Flying's The Most
Difficult Thing There Is.

21:41.902 --> 21:43.171
I Can't Even Fly.

21:43.203 --> 21:44.838
Was There Ever
Any Doubt,

21:44.872 --> 21:46.641
Considering Who
His Father Is?

21:46.673 --> 21:48.576
And His Grandfather.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.380
Scott, I've Been
Waiting For This Day

21:52.413 --> 21:54.182
Since You Were Born.

21:54.214 --> 21:56.317
Man, I Am So
Jealous.

21:56.349 --> 21:59.920
Oh, Come On, Scott.
You Have To Give Us A Little Demonstration.

21:59.953 --> 22:02.456
Yeah. Show Us What
You Really Can Do.

22:02.490 --> 22:04.092
I Want To See You
Fly. Come On.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.826
Uh, Sure.

22:05.859 --> 22:09.697
Let Me Just Go Put On My
Training Cape, Ok?

22:11.965 --> 22:13.834
Yeah!

22:19.807 --> 22:22.844
Fly? I Can't Fly.

22:22.876 --> 22:25.178
I'll Just Say It
Was A Fluke.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.816
I'm Not Fooling Anyone.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.454
I Hope You Two Picked Out
A Decent Name For Him.

22:34.488 --> 22:37.458
My Father Named Me
"The Steel Condor,"

22:37.490 --> 22:39.093
Because I've Got
Muscles Of Steel.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.894
Dad, Don't Get Started.

22:40.928 --> 22:45.233
And Then That Clark "Curl In The Middle
Of His Forehead" Kent Comes Along,

22:45.266 --> 22:47.268
Gets Himself A Publicist,

22:47.300 --> 22:49.236
And Starts Calling Himself,
"The Man Of Steel."

22:49.269 --> 22:50.771
What Does That Make Me,

22:50.805 --> 22:52.006
The Bird Of Steel?

22:53.807 --> 22:56.844
I'm Outside. I'll
Yell When I'm Ready.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.280
As I Was Saying, Krypton!
Krypton! Krypton!

23:00.314 --> 23:02.150
Ready!

23:03.116 --> 23:07.020
Up, Up And Away!

23:09.123 --> 23:10.125
Oh, He Hit The Tree!

23:15.729 --> 23:17.164
Where Is He?

23:17.198 --> 23:18.867
He's Not In The Tree.

23:19.933 --> 23:21.635
Then He's Gotta
Be In The Sky.

23:22.970 --> 23:24.404
He Did It!

23:24.438 --> 23:25.740
He's Flying.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.411
What If There's
A Downdraft?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.981
You Know How Difficult
Those Can Be.

23:35.316 --> 23:36.918
Jim, I Think You
Better Go After Him,

23:36.951 --> 23:38.885
Before There's An Altercation
With A Low-Flying Plane.

23:38.919 --> 23:40.755
Ok. Ok, Honey. Ok.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.722
Up! Up!

23:42.756 --> 23:44.091
Look Out!

23:44.124 --> 23:47.327
Oh, Scooter, You Are
The Man! You Did It!

23:47.361 --> 23:48.796
Congratulations!

23:48.828 --> 23:50.932
Scott, Are You Ok?

23:50.964 --> 23:54.034
Oh, Honey, We Are
So Proud Of You.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.569
We're Gonna Celebrate.

23:55.603 --> 23:57.672
Let's Go Downtown And
Have Some Ice Cream.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.807
I Still Don't
Believe You Flew.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.675
Well, I Did.

24:01.709 --> 24:03.644
Uh-Huh. Whatever.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.712
Molly, Molly.
Let's Go Inside.

24:07.248 --> 24:09.350
Let Me Have A Few
Seconds With The Boy.

24:09.383 --> 24:10.852
I'm Gonna Give Him
A Few Pointers.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.654
Pretty Impressive.

24:14.688 --> 24:17.525
Thanks.
I'm Still Trying To Get My Ears To Pop.

24:17.557 --> 24:21.362
Those Super Powers Of Yours
Just Came Out Of Nowhere.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.897
Yeah. Like I Said,
They Come And Go.

24:23.931 --> 24:25.833
Kind Of Like The Door
This Afternoon, Huh?

24:25.865 --> 24:26.968
With All Those Screws Loose?

24:27.999 --> 24:29.604
Yeah. Pretty Shoddy
Workmanship, Huh?

24:29.636 --> 24:32.138
Well, I'm Going Inside Now.

24:32.172 --> 24:33.274
Scott...

24:35.976 --> 24:37.512
You Know, Don't You?

24:37.545 --> 24:38.778
Yes.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.413
Do They?

24:40.446 --> 24:43.216
No. And They Couldn't Be
More Excited For You.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.553
Grandpa, Please Don't
Say Anything, Ok?

24:45.586 --> 24:48.556
But, Scott, A Superhero
Is Not Supposed To Lie.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.956
I Know, But I Had To.

24:49.990 --> 24:51.959
They Were Gonna End Up
Canceling The Party.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.494
Look, The Party Is In Honor Of
You Becoming A Superhero.

24:54.528 --> 24:56.063
Getting Your Powers!

24:56.096 --> 24:58.665
But Dad Was Gonna Be Embarrassed
In Front Of All His Friends.

24:58.699 --> 25:01.102
I Couldn't Just Let
Him Down Like That.

25:01.134 --> 25:03.871
Grandpa, Please
Don't Say Anything.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.342
Look, I'll Tell Mom And Dad
Right After The Party's Over, Ok?

25:08.107 --> 25:09.376
Please?

25:11.345 --> 25:13.247
Ok. Ok.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.848
Thanks, Grandpa.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.720
I Love You.

25:20.054 --> 25:20.955
Love You Too.

25:24.424 --> 25:25.859
Hey, Son.

25:25.893 --> 25:26.826
Oh, Hey, Dad.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.061
You're Up Awfully Early.

25:28.095 --> 25:30.197
Yeah. With All The
Excitement Last Night,

25:30.230 --> 25:31.566
I Kinda Forgot To
Do My Homework.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.268
Well, Remember, If
You Want To Fly,

25:34.300 --> 25:36.470
You're Gonna Have To
Maintain A "B" Average.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.139
Flying Is A Privilege,
Not A Right.

25:39.173 --> 25:40.942
Yes, Sir.

25:46.747 --> 25:49.616
<I>Welcome To Earth Protectors.

25:49.650 --> 25:52.053
<I>You Have Been Chosen
To Save The Planet.

25:52.086 --> 25:56.423
<I>Listen Very Carefully To The
Following Instructions.

25:56.457 --> 26:01.829
<I>Relax And Let Earth Protectors
Do All The Thinking For You.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.304
Scott, Let's Go.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.641
What Is Taking
You So Long?

26:13.673 --> 26:16.076
You're Gonna Be Late
For School, Son.

26:16.109 --> 26:17.444
Scott!

26:17.478 --> 26:19.447
Oh, That Was Quick.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.115
Hope All The Assignments
Are This Easy.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.951
How Can You Stare At This
Screen So Mindlessly?

26:23.983 --> 26:27.487
It's Like This Thing's
Got You Mesmerized.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.990
I Just Need To
Change, Ok?

26:34.795 --> 26:36.096
Mesmerized...

26:38.298 --> 26:39.366
Good Morning, Adam.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.368
Hey, Dad.

26:40.401 --> 26:42.003
Did You Hear About This?

26:42.036 --> 26:44.939
The Guys From The Bank
Robbery Escaped.

26:44.971 --> 26:47.508
All The Cells Opened
Automatically.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.810
I Bet They're Calling It
A Computer Malfunction.

26:50.844 --> 26:52.779
Yeah. How'd You Know?

26:52.813 --> 26:54.715
A Hunch.

26:54.748 --> 26:59.953
Do You Mind Going By The Bank With Me Before School?
I--

26:59.987 --> 27:02.123
I Thought You'd Never Ask.

27:03.390 --> 27:05.727
Let Me Go Get Dressed.

27:07.528 --> 27:09.596
Oh, Yeah. Oh, Yeah.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.432
At First I Thought The
Criminals Used Some Sort

27:12.465 --> 27:15.435
Of Hand-Held,
Mind-Control Device,

27:15.469 --> 27:17.471
But The More I
Thought About It,

27:17.503 --> 27:20.240
It Could've Been Generated
Within The Computer Itself.

27:20.273 --> 27:23.710
If You're Suggesting That
Our Systems Are To Blame--

27:23.743 --> 27:26.513
No, But You Never Know.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.483
Silver Charge, Take A Look.

27:30.517 --> 27:31.818
I'm On It.

27:47.101 --> 27:49.971
Sometimes, He Gets
A Little Excited.

27:54.508 --> 27:55.843
Good Morning,
Miss Parker.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.845
Good Morning, Scott.

28:20.968 --> 28:23.170
Very Good Work.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.574
Now, Did Anyone Not Do
Their Homework Assignment?

28:34.213 --> 28:36.282
It Really Works!

28:36.316 --> 28:39.153
Every Single One
Of Them! Blue!

28:39.185 --> 28:41.554
What Shall We
Teach 'Em First?

28:41.587 --> 28:44.090
Recycling? Composting?

28:44.124 --> 28:46.093
Love Of Tofu?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.195
Looks Like We Can Make 'Em
Do Anything We Want.

28:50.864 --> 28:52.298
What Are You Doing?

28:52.332 --> 28:54.335
I'm Gonna Bean
Your Boyfriend.

28:54.367 --> 28:56.069
How Weird Would It Be If I
Asked Amy To That Dance?

28:56.103 --> 28:59.474
Really Weird,
'Cause It'll Mean You Got A Backbone Transplant.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.209
Hey. What's With
All The Blue?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.512
What Are You
Talking About?

29:05.546 --> 29:07.815
Blue. You're All
Wearing Blue.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.415
Is It Some Sort Of Pep
Rally Or Something?

29:09.449 --> 29:11.786
I Didn't Even Notice.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.119
Coincidence?

29:13.153 --> 29:14.721
Hey, Randy,
Think Fast!

29:16.490 --> 29:17.625
Hey, Scott, Think Fast!

29:18.991 --> 29:21.596
Why'd You Do That?
Now She's Gonna Think I Can't Catch.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.301
Are You Ok?

29:28.335 --> 29:30.203
Yeah. I'll Be Fine.

29:30.237 --> 29:32.273
What Were You Thinking?

29:32.306 --> 29:33.841
You Were Gonna Catch
That, Weren't You?

29:33.874 --> 29:35.175
Look, I Forgot, Ok?

29:35.209 --> 29:37.111
You Can't Forget
Anymore.

29:37.144 --> 29:38.378
Now That You Have
These Powers,

29:38.412 --> 29:39.913
You're Gonna Have To Be
A Lot More Careful.

29:39.946 --> 29:43.483
Aluminum Foil Is
The One Thing

29:43.517 --> 29:45.519
That Screws Up Our
Molecular Structure.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.088
Too Much Of It Can Kill Us!

29:50.523 --> 29:52.125
You Know What?
You're Right Though.

29:52.159 --> 29:53.360
I Mean, How're We Gonna
Expand This Thing?

29:53.393 --> 29:55.196
I Mean, We Owe
It To The Planet

29:55.229 --> 29:57.730
To Get This Program Into Every School In The Country.

29:57.763 --> 29:59.567
Look, You Just Leave
That Up To Me, Ok?

29:59.599 --> 30:01.334
You Go Back And Work
On Some More Tests.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.435
We'll Meet Up
With You Later.

30:02.469 --> 30:03.403
Cool.

30:02.469 --> 30:03.403
Bye.

30:05.505 --> 30:07.708
Fact Is, I'm Already
Way Ahead Of Her.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.911
Actually, I Added A Little
Pizazz To Today's Lesson.

30:10.943 --> 30:15.249
3... 2...1... Snack Time.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.667
You Gave Them Chocolate
Cravings? Ha Ha!

30:34.701 --> 30:36.103
I Can Make 'Em Do Anything I Want 'Em To Do.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.872
Buy Anything I
Want 'Em To Buy,

30:37.904 --> 30:39.740
Watch Anything I
Want 'Em To Watch.

30:39.772 --> 30:41.608
And People Will Pay For That Kind Of Influence.

30:41.642 --> 30:43.043
Exactly.

30:43.076 --> 30:45.746
You See, Nina's Problem Is,
She Wants To Do Too Much.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.681
I Mean, She's Not
Gonna Be Happy

30:47.713 --> 30:49.750
Until She's Saved The
Ozone, Fed The Hungry,

30:49.782 --> 30:51.484
And Made Meat-Eating
Illegal.

30:51.518 --> 30:55.456
Me, I Have Much
Simpler Desires.

30:55.489 --> 30:59.293
Ten Or Twenty Billion Dollars
Would Make Me Incredibly Happy.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.130
<I>So We're Here To Warn You

31:04.163 --> 31:07.468
<I>That There's A New Criminal
Mastermind In Our Midst.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.305
<I>This Mastermind Is Using An
Ingenious Computer Program

31:11.337 --> 31:12.873
<I>To Brainwash.

31:12.905 --> 31:14.375
Malcolm, What
Are We Gonna Do?

31:14.407 --> 31:16.676
You Were Right.
They're Actually Gonna Try And Stop Us.

31:16.710 --> 31:19.779
Not If We Stop Them First.

31:19.813 --> 31:21.515
<I>We're Currently Working
With Authorities.

31:21.548 --> 31:24.718
<I>And We're Producing And
Distributing An Anti-Virus Program

31:24.750 --> 31:28.187
<I>That Will Disable And Destroy
Their Brainwashing Software.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.891
Cool! I Didn't Know You
Could Program A Computer.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.192
I Can't.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.562
I Just Thought It Would
Buy Us Some Time.

31:35.595 --> 31:37.631
Yeah, And Even
If We Could,

31:37.663 --> 31:39.165
Thanks To Your
Brother,

31:39.199 --> 31:42.737
Whatever Evidence There Was Is Completely Fried.

31:43.537 --> 31:45.271
<I>Thank You. Yes?

31:45.305 --> 31:46.539
Speaking Of Fried,

31:46.573 --> 31:49.977
Is That Your
Chicken I Smell?

31:54.714 --> 31:55.715
Excellent, Excellent.

31:55.749 --> 31:57.418
Ok, Chin Up,
Chin Up, Chin Up.

31:57.451 --> 32:01.855
Shoulders Back Just
A Little Bit More.

32:01.887 --> 32:05.058
Shoulders Back. That's Good.

32:05.092 --> 32:08.395
'Cause Nobody Respects A
Superhero That Slouches.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.297
That's What Happened
To Your Uncle Freddy.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.432
That's Why They
Kicked Him Out.

32:11.464 --> 32:12.599
That's Right.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.934
Thanks For The
Lessons.

32:14.968 --> 32:16.070
Would You Look
At The Time?

32:16.103 --> 32:17.571
No, No, No, No.

32:17.604 --> 32:21.408
Now, The Most Important Thing
To Remember About Takeoff,

32:21.441 --> 32:23.410
Other Than Watching Out
For The Trees--

32:23.442 --> 32:24.577
And Fences!

32:24.611 --> 32:25.980
...Is That You Have
To Go Fast Enough

32:26.012 --> 32:27.614
So Nobody
Can See You.

32:27.646 --> 32:29.549
Especially When You're
Not In Costume.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.785
Well, It's Gonna Be A While Before We Can Practice.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.989
'Cause I Just Kind Of Putt
Along On My Takeoffs.

32:35.021 --> 32:36.990
The Whole Neighborhood
Would Know. See Ya.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.391
No, No, No, No.
Scott, Scott.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.228
That's Why We Practice
Takeoffs At Night.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.430
But You Can Practice
Flying At Anytime.

32:43.462 --> 32:44.464
See Ya Guys Later.

32:44.498 --> 32:46.167
Up, Up And Away!

32:53.640 --> 32:56.711
Keep Your Eyes Open, Son.
Keep Your Eyes Open.

32:58.045 --> 33:01.115
C'mon, Son. Keep Your Eyes
Open. Keep Your Eyes Open.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.850
Dad, What Are
You Doing?

33:03.884 --> 33:06.053
Letting You Get Used
To How It Feels, Son.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.889
I'm Flying! I'm Really Flying!

33:13.192 --> 33:14.627
You're Not Gonna
Let Go, Are You?

33:14.661 --> 33:16.964
No, Not Without A Warning.

33:16.997 --> 33:18.966
This Is A Warning.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.534
Aaahhh!

33:20.567 --> 33:22.970
Dad! No! Help Me!

33:28.174 --> 33:30.109
You Know, This
Is So Unlike Jim.

33:30.143 --> 33:32.211
He's Usually Never Late.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.980
I Don't Know, Judy.
I've Got To Get This Game On The Go.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.582
Oh, There They Are.

33:36.316 --> 33:37.550
Hi, Honey.

33:37.584 --> 33:38.753
Finally.

33:40.220 --> 33:41.422
I Was Getting Worried.

33:42.489 --> 33:45.125
Ah, Because If
You Missed,

33:45.157 --> 33:46.959
I'd Automatically
Be Captain

33:46.992 --> 33:48.628
And I Don't Want To
Win On Technicality.

33:48.662 --> 33:50.631
Try Not To Mess Up.

33:50.663 --> 33:51.932
Mess Up?

33:51.964 --> 33:53.800
Yeah. Mess Up.

33:53.834 --> 33:56.269
Marshall, Rosen,
Get On The Field.

33:56.303 --> 33:57.538
Come On.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.340
Either You Were Practicing Loop-The-Loops,

34:01.374 --> 34:02.643
Or It Didn't
Go Very Well.

34:02.675 --> 34:05.144
It Was Like He's Never
Flown Before In His Life.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.214
I've Never Seen Powers
Come And Go Like That.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.717
Don't Be Too
Hard On Him.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.853
Maybe He's Having
Trouble Concentrating

34:12.885 --> 34:14.487
Because He's So Excited
About Tomorrow.

34:17.523 --> 34:19.626
Yeah. Yeah.

34:24.664 --> 34:25.833
Here You Go.

34:25.864 --> 34:26.867
Thank You.

34:35.742 --> 34:36.844
Everything's Ready.

34:36.876 --> 34:38.244
Excellent.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.013
You Sure You
Want To Do This?

34:41.047 --> 34:43.451
Wouldn't It Be Better Just To Lay Low For A While?

34:45.117 --> 34:48.188
Look, Achieving Greatness
Involves A Certain Amount Of Risk.

34:48.221 --> 34:52.391
Pretty Soon We're Gonna Have 20
Million Young Minds Under Our Control.

34:52.425 --> 34:55.629
If Today Goes Well,
The Superheros Can Provide The Muscle.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.564
There's Gonna Be
Nobody Out There

34:58.597 --> 35:00.467
That's Gonna Be
Able To Stop Us.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.003
Except Nina.

35:05.405 --> 35:06.841
Except Nina.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.154
That's Why I Always
Saved The Day.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.428
Oh, Reach. I'm Glad
You Could Make It.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.864
Wonton?

35:30.896 --> 35:33.166
Oh, Here. Don't
Forget A Napkin.

35:34.601 --> 35:36.503
These Spinach
Puffs Are Great.

35:36.536 --> 35:38.304
Judy's An Excellent Cook.

35:38.338 --> 35:40.574
So, Anyway, Back To Me.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.041
So You Still Want To
Go Through With It?

35:42.074 --> 35:44.777
I Have To. Dad Is So--

35:44.811 --> 35:46.480
Don't Underestimate
Your Father.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.482
He Loves You. Powers
Or No Powers.

35:49.516 --> 35:51.885
So, Whatever You
Decide To Do,

35:51.918 --> 35:53.186
I'll Be Right
Beside You.

35:53.219 --> 35:54.587
Thanks, Grandpa.

35:56.590 --> 35:58.158
Can I Have Everybody's
Attention, Please?

35:58.190 --> 36:02.461
We're Here Today To
Honor And Welcome

36:02.494 --> 36:04.397
The Newest Superhero--

36:04.431 --> 36:05.532
My Son Scott.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.836
I'm Really
Proud Of You.

36:10.869 --> 36:14.574
Recognizing Scott's
Unique Talents,

36:14.608 --> 36:16.843
Warrior Woman And
I Have Decided

36:16.876 --> 36:18.846
To Name Him Warrior Eagle.

36:25.418 --> 36:27.021
It's Time To Take Your Oath.

36:31.123 --> 36:34.160
Do You, Warrior Eagle,

36:34.193 --> 36:36.230
Agree To Only Use
Your Power For Good,

36:36.262 --> 36:38.632
To Fight For Peace
And Freedom,

36:38.664 --> 36:40.601
And To Uphold The
Superhero Credo

36:40.634 --> 36:43.871
Of Truth, Justice,
And Integrity?

36:48.141 --> 36:50.376
Dad, I Have To Tell
You Something...

36:50.409 --> 36:55.382
Uh, Scott, You're
Supposed To Say, "I Do."

37:06.126 --> 37:08.162
I Do.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.702
I Don't Know About
This, Malcolm.

37:15.735 --> 37:18.105
Look, Nina. This Is
Very Simple, Ok?

37:18.137 --> 37:20.007
When Bronze Eagle Arrives,

37:20.039 --> 37:21.708
You Just Slip The Homing
Device Right Onto Him.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.043
Me? Why Me?

37:24.077 --> 37:25.345
Because If You
Don't Do It,

37:25.378 --> 37:27.014
We're Not Going To Be Able
To Find His Hideout.

37:27.047 --> 37:28.315
And If We Can't
Find His Hideout,

37:28.347 --> 37:29.516
We're Not Going To
Be Able To Stop Him.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.784
And If We Can't
Stop Him,

37:31.818 --> 37:34.054
All This Hard Work Will
Have Been For Nothing.

37:34.086 --> 37:37.724
Is That What You Want?

37:37.757 --> 37:40.927
Well, No,
But I Still Don't Understand Why I...

37:40.960 --> 37:43.063
Thanks, Nina. We're
All Counting On You.

37:46.666 --> 37:48.068
Here You Go.

37:53.672 --> 37:55.375
The Door To The
Roof's Welded Shut.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.110
She's Not Getting
Out That Way.

37:57.143 --> 37:59.512
I Think She's Probably Gonna Have A
Tough Time With The Front Door Too.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.181
So Even If Her Friends
Don't Show Up,

38:02.215 --> 38:07.421
This Is What We Criminal
Masterminds Call A Win-Win Situation.

38:11.190 --> 38:12.959
[Explosion]

38:15.762 --> 38:17.331
You In The Mood For Steak?

38:17.364 --> 38:18.766
Let's Go. I'm Buying.

38:27.340 --> 38:30.044
[Coughing]

38:39.786 --> 38:41.989
I've Got To Tell You,
I Think He's Gonna Be One Of The Best.

38:43.255 --> 38:46.492
[Beeping]

38:53.699 --> 38:56.135
Oh, There's A Woman In
A Burning Building.

38:56.168 --> 38:59.138
Honey, I'd Better
Take This.

38:59.172 --> 39:00.139
I'll Be Back.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.441
No, No. Please?
Let Me Go.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.643
Flash! There And Back!

39:03.675 --> 39:05.311
Why Not Let The
Boy Do It?

39:05.344 --> 39:06.913
I Mean, Woman In A
Burning Building--

39:06.945 --> 39:08.414
That's Superheroing 101.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.116
You've Got A Point
There, Reach.

39:10.150 --> 39:11.651
What Do You Say, Scott?

39:11.684 --> 39:15.722
I Mean, Warrior Eagle.

39:15.755 --> 39:17.157
Jim, Honey, I Don't Know.

39:17.190 --> 39:19.291
[Chanting]
Warrior - Eagle!

39:19.324 --> 39:21.027
Warrior - Eagle!

39:21.059 --> 39:22.695
Warrior - Eagle!

39:22.728 --> 39:24.431
Warrior - Eagle!

39:24.463 --> 39:25.998
Warrior - Eagle!

39:26.032 --> 39:28.101
Where's Grandpa?

39:28.134 --> 39:31.103
Hello. Here I Am,
The Handsome Prince.

39:31.137 --> 39:34.374
I Am Coming To Rescue
The Lovely Princess.

39:34.407 --> 39:37.344
Son, This Woman's In
A Burning Building.

39:37.376 --> 39:39.079
I Think You've Got
To Take This.

39:39.112 --> 39:42.481
Right. Uh, I'm All Over It.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.016
All Right, All Ri--

39:44.050 --> 39:45.085
Yeah, Yeah.

39:49.456 --> 39:52.358
Up, Up And Away!

40:02.068 --> 40:04.705
That's My Boy!

40:06.873 --> 40:08.307
Oh, There He Is.
There He Is.

40:08.340 --> 40:10.242
No. Helicopter. Helicopter.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.612
Oh! Eagle. Eagle.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.449
Oh! Yes! Yes!

40:17.684 --> 40:18.886
Ufo.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.634
[Coughing]

40:39.038 --> 40:41.574
Roof. Gotta Get
To The Roof.

40:47.914 --> 40:49.349
Help!

40:49.382 --> 40:51.851
Somebody!

40:53.519 --> 40:55.155
Bronze Eagle!

40:55.188 --> 40:57.691
<I>I'm Downtown At The
Scene Of A 4-Alarm Fire

40:57.724 --> 40:59.659
<I>Which Is Currently
Raging Out Of Control.

40:59.692 --> 41:02.661
<I>And I've Just Been Informed That There's
A Woman Trapped In The Building.

41:02.695 --> 41:04.397
Where Is He?!

41:04.429 --> 41:06.332
Did He Take The
Scenic Route?

41:06.365 --> 41:07.099
What's Up?

41:08.800 --> 41:12.739
Attempts To Rescue The
Woman Have Been Futile.

41:12.771 --> 41:15.775
Officials Tell Me That...

41:18.143 --> 41:19.678
Kid, Where Do You
Think You're Going?

41:19.711 --> 41:21.313
It's An Emergency.

41:21.347 --> 41:23.517
No Kidding, No Kidding.

41:23.550 --> 41:24.852
Nice Cape.

41:28.922 --> 41:31.057
There He Is!
There He Is!

41:31.090 --> 41:33.425
<I>...Attempt To Rescue A Woman
Trapped Inside The Burning Building.

41:33.458 --> 41:36.096
What's He Doing
On The Ground?

41:39.498 --> 41:41.234
The Kid's Gone Into
The Building!

41:42.735 --> 41:45.639
[Coughing]

41:47.072 --> 41:48.074
Somebody?

41:48.106 --> 41:50.809
Don't Worry! I'm Here!

41:50.842 --> 41:52.711
Now Listen To Me.

41:52.744 --> 41:54.146
We Just Need To Find
A Firehose, Ok?

41:54.179 --> 41:56.315
Wait! Who Are You?

41:56.349 --> 41:57.951
Oh.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.554
Never Fear, Warrior
Eagle Is Here.

42:03.255 --> 42:05.257
I Know. It's
Kind Of Dorky.

42:05.291 --> 42:07.494
You're A Superhero?

42:07.527 --> 42:10.063
Long Story. Come On!

42:10.096 --> 42:12.965
We're Sure Not Going
Back Out That Way.

42:25.878 --> 42:28.448
There's A Firehose And
A Ladder! Come On!

42:29.882 --> 42:31.552
Stay With Me!

42:38.891 --> 42:40.293
Where's The Water?!

42:40.326 --> 42:42.262
Why Can't We Just
Fly Out Of Here?

42:42.295 --> 42:44.497
You Can Fly?
That's Great!

42:44.530 --> 42:47.167
No! I Can't Fly!

42:48.867 --> 42:51.471
Go Up. I've Got An Idea.

42:53.438 --> 42:54.707
I Hope You Know What You're Doing.

42:54.740 --> 42:56.710
I'm Right Behind You.

43:03.449 --> 43:05.351
[Coughing]

43:13.525 --> 43:14.927
Here I Come!

43:16.061 --> 43:18.464
Judy, Could You Get Me A
Couple Of Ice Cubes?

43:18.498 --> 43:20.634
I Didn't Rescue My Little
Princess Soon Enough.

43:22.402 --> 43:25.304
What's The Matter?
Where's Scott?

43:26.606 --> 43:30.243
<I>...There's A Kid In A
Mask And A Cape...

43:30.275 --> 43:31.611
Scott?

43:34.179 --> 43:35.481
Jim...

43:35.514 --> 43:36.482
What?

43:45.090 --> 43:46.125
Come On!

43:46.159 --> 43:47.227
What Are You Doing?!

43:47.260 --> 43:48.628
Come On!

43:48.661 --> 43:49.929
No! There's Gotta
Be Another Way.

43:52.565 --> 43:54.467
Come On! Come On!

43:57.737 --> 43:58.838
Don't Be Afraid.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.203
Please Don't Drop Me!

44:08.904 --> 44:09.872
Come On.

44:09.906 --> 44:11.608
Don't Drop Me!

44:17.546 --> 44:19.415
I'm Slipping!

44:20.917 --> 44:22.685
Aaahh!

44:25.321 --> 44:27.223
Don't Worry. I've Got You.

44:31.593 --> 44:33.729
Aaaahhh!

44:36.866 --> 44:37.901
Bronze Eagle!

44:43.673 --> 44:44.908
Dad?

44:44.941 --> 44:46.576
Come On. We've
Got To Get This.

44:47.910 --> 44:49.211
I Can Explain.

44:49.245 --> 44:51.114
Good, 'Cause You've Got A
Lot Of Explaining To Do.

44:51.147 --> 44:52.716
Now Get On Your Bike
And Get Home.

44:52.749 --> 44:54.116
But I--

44:54.149 --> 44:55.484
Now!

44:55.517 --> 44:56.319
Bye.

44:58.888 --> 45:00.090
Kids.

45:22.178 --> 45:24.848
You Don't Know How Disappointed We Are, Scott.

45:24.881 --> 45:27.384
'Cause I'm Not A
Superhero?

45:27.417 --> 45:29.419
No. Because You
Lied To Us.

45:29.451 --> 45:33.055
To Everyone. Because You Almost
Got Yourself And That Woman Killed.

45:33.089 --> 45:35.625
Because I Embarrassed You In Front Of Your Friends?

45:35.658 --> 45:38.828
Scott, This Is
Not About Us.

45:38.861 --> 45:42.165
Scott, I'm Sorry That You Thought You
Had To Do This Just To Make Us Happy.

45:42.198 --> 45:43.833
But We Love You, No
Matter What You Are.

45:43.866 --> 45:46.036
Powers Or No Powers.

45:46.069 --> 45:48.138
That's What
Grandpa Said.

45:48.171 --> 45:51.308
I Just Saw How
Happy You Were

45:51.341 --> 45:53.877
When Adam Circled The Globe In
Under A Second For The First Time.

45:53.910 --> 45:56.913
And When Molly Could Boil
Water At The Age Of Two...

45:56.946 --> 45:58.415
Listen To Me, Sweetie.

45:58.448 --> 46:01.585
We Love You Just
For Being You.

46:03.519 --> 46:06.122
I Didn't Mean To
Hurt Anyone.

46:06.154 --> 46:07.957
We Know.

46:07.991 --> 46:10.727
Why Don't You
Hit The Showers?

46:10.759 --> 46:13.095
And We'll Talk About
This Some More Tomorrow.

46:19.769 --> 46:21.437
Poor Kid.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.843
Any Concern About His
Mask Falling Off?

46:26.875 --> 46:29.578
Shall We Send Adam Out To Do
A Little Mind Erasing?

46:29.611 --> 46:32.281
No. We'll Be Fine.

46:32.314 --> 46:36.185
The Public Was Too Far
Away To See Anything,

46:36.218 --> 46:38.421
And That Woman Has No
Way Of Finding It.

46:40.256 --> 46:42.792
It's Beautiful, Nina.
That's Just Beautiful.

46:48.163 --> 46:50.966
Did You Kids See That Boy On The News Yesterday?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.537
Oh, Yeah!
You Mean The Stupid Kid With The Cape?

46:54.569 --> 46:56.338
What Kind Of Loser
Wears A Cape?

46:56.372 --> 46:57.707
He Thought He
Was A Superhero.

46:57.740 --> 47:00.042
He Forgot One Thing--
Super Powers!

47:00.075 --> 47:02.645
And Then Bronze Eagle Had
To Totally Save His Butt.

47:02.678 --> 47:04.847
Help Me! Save Me! I'm In
A Burning Building!

47:04.881 --> 47:07.116
Knock It Off, Randy!

47:08.651 --> 47:10.854
It's Not His Fault He Didn't Get
His Super Powers When He Was...

47:13.221 --> 47:17.026
You're Right. Total Loser.

47:25.667 --> 47:27.503
Here's The Earth
Protector Software

47:27.537 --> 47:29.372
For You To Take Home
And Test Tonight.

47:29.404 --> 47:31.640
Be Sure You Review
These Discs

47:31.674 --> 47:34.177
And Return Them The
First Thing Tomorrow.

47:34.209 --> 47:37.146
Don't Forget, It's
Your Homework.

47:56.332 --> 47:58.435
It's Not Your Dad's Fault.

47:58.468 --> 48:01.071
I Know.

48:01.104 --> 48:04.774
I'm Sorry. I'm Sure This
All Doesn't Seem Fair.

48:04.807 --> 48:07.843
But This Means You Can Be
Anything You Wanna Be Now.

48:07.877 --> 48:10.013
Look, Grandpa, I Want
To Be A Superhero.

48:10.046 --> 48:11.980
Well, Stop Whining
And Be One.

48:12.013 --> 48:13.383
How? I Can't Fly!

48:13.415 --> 48:15.118
I Can't Run At
Supersonic Speed.

48:15.151 --> 48:19.423
Look, It's Not The Cape That
Makes Your Dad A Hero.

48:21.557 --> 48:22.759
Think It Over.

48:37.607 --> 48:40.210
<I>Welcome To Earth Protectors.

48:40.243 --> 48:43.179
<I>It's Time For You
To Take Control.

48:43.212 --> 48:47.217
<I>Listen Very Carefully To The
Following Instructions.

48:47.250 --> 48:51.154
<I>Earth Protectors Will Tell
You Exactly What To Do.

48:51.187 --> 48:56.692
<I>Relax And Let Earth Protectors
Do All The Thinking For You.

48:56.725 --> 48:59.194
<I>We Are Here To Help You.

48:59.227 --> 49:02.999
<I>We Are Here To Help
You Take Control.

49:03.031 --> 49:06.202
<I>We Are Here To Help
You Take Control.

50:04.026 --> 50:05.995
Molly?

50:09.332 --> 50:11.401
That Is Not Cute.

50:11.433 --> 50:13.368
Honey, Honey,
Honey, Honey...

50:13.401 --> 50:15.604
Did You Take Some Money
Out Of My Wallet?

50:15.638 --> 50:17.473
No, But I Should Have.

50:17.506 --> 50:18.807
You Already
Cleaned Me Out.

50:18.841 --> 50:19.609
No, No. I Didn't Take
Any Money From You.

50:19.642 --> 50:20.944
Speaking Of Money--

50:20.977 --> 50:22.345
Mom, Did You Borrow Money
For The Paper Boy Again?

50:22.377 --> 50:23.846
Because I'm Missing 20 Bucks.

50:24.779 --> 50:27.149
Ok, I'm Outta Here.

50:27.183 --> 50:29.919
Scott, You Didn't...

50:29.951 --> 50:31.520
No Way.

50:31.553 --> 50:33.522
Wait A Minute.

50:37.826 --> 50:41.798
With My X-Ray Vision, I Can
See Money In Your Backpack.

50:46.102 --> 50:47.569
You Have To Believe Me.

50:47.602 --> 50:49.171
I Don't Know How
It Got In There.

50:49.205 --> 50:52.909
I'm Not Really Into The "Believing
Scott" Business These Days.

50:52.941 --> 50:54.076
Scott, If This Is
A Cry For Help,

50:54.109 --> 50:55.678
You Need To Talk To Us.

50:55.711 --> 50:58.448
Honey, Regardless,
We're Gonna Have To Punish You For Stealing.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.850
What?! I Didn't
Take The Money!

51:00.883 --> 51:03.019
And Lying About
It, Scott.

51:03.051 --> 51:05.521
I'm Holding The
Money In My Hand.

51:05.555 --> 51:07.490
All Right, That's
It. No Soccer.

51:07.522 --> 51:08.725
What?!

51:08.758 --> 51:09.759
For At Least A Month.

51:09.792 --> 51:10.860
You Can't Do That!

51:10.892 --> 51:12.728
We're Picking A
Captain In Two Days.

51:14.497 --> 51:16.031
This Isn't Fair.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.302
No Soccer?

51:20.336 --> 51:21.703
That's What
They Said.

51:21.736 --> 51:23.238
I Can't Believe They Think I Took The Stupid Money.

51:23.272 --> 51:27.777
What I Don't Get Is How Come The
Money Got Inside The Backpack.

51:27.810 --> 51:28.778
I Mean...

51:28.810 --> 51:30.345
It Beats Me, Man.

51:30.379 --> 51:31.647
Weird.

51:40.423 --> 51:42.658
I Would Love To
Know Your Secret.

51:42.691 --> 51:44.560
I Can't Even Get Them To
Hand In Their Homework.

51:44.593 --> 51:45.627
Good Job.

51:45.660 --> 51:47.196
Thank You.

51:58.174 --> 51:59.509
What Are You
Gonna Do To Him?

51:59.542 --> 52:02.212
Nothing.
You Said This Kid Saved Your Life, Right?

52:03.312 --> 52:04.547
I'm Not Gonna
Do Anything.

52:04.580 --> 52:05.515
I'm Grateful.

52:14.290 --> 52:16.492
Perfect Match.

52:16.524 --> 52:19.628
You Know, I Think It's Time
I Met This Scott Marshall.

52:19.662 --> 52:22.464
[Intercom] <I>Good Morning,
Students Of Centennial School.

52:22.497 --> 52:24.366
<I>Please Go To Your
Classrooms Now.

52:24.399 --> 52:27.102
Hey, Did You See That Totally Lame
Adventure Program Last Night?

52:27.136 --> 52:29.906
Stunk. But For Some Reason,
I Couldn't Turn It Off.

52:29.939 --> 52:31.741
Yeah. Me Too.

52:31.774 --> 52:34.444
Oh, Scott.
They Need To See You In The Principal's Office.

52:37.046 --> 52:40.082
Remember, Corporal Punishment Is
Illegal In This State.

52:41.383 --> 52:42.451
Thanks.

52:44.486 --> 52:46.689
This Is Quite An Honor
For You, Scott.

52:46.721 --> 52:48.658
Earth Protectors
Has Picked You

52:48.691 --> 52:50.894
Out Of All The Students To
Test Their Latest Product.

52:52.361 --> 52:53.663
Have Fun.

52:53.696 --> 52:54.964
Thanks, Miss Parker.

52:57.767 --> 52:59.969
<I>Welcome To Earth Protectors.

53:00.002 --> 53:02.505
<I>You Have Been
Individually Selected

53:02.537 --> 53:05.107
<I>For This Special Earth
Protectors Upgrade.

53:05.140 --> 53:08.810
<I>Listen Very Carefully To The
Following Instructions.

53:08.843 --> 53:13.048
<I>It Is Very Important That You Answer
All Of The Following Questions

53:13.082 --> 53:14.616
<I>Honestly And Accurately.

53:14.649 --> 53:17.586
Ok, Scott, Let's Start With
A Few Simple Questions

53:17.620 --> 53:18.955
About Your Family.

53:18.988 --> 53:22.424
Likes, Dislikes, Weaknesses.

53:22.457 --> 53:25.227
You Know, This Way,
Nina Can Reconfigure The Parameters Of The Software

53:25.261 --> 53:26.796
And We'll Be Able To
Enslave Your Parents.

53:32.834 --> 53:35.070
Scott! Hey,
Come Here!

53:35.104 --> 53:37.406
Scott. Hey. What Was
That All About?

53:37.439 --> 53:39.107
No Idea. It Was
Totally Stupid.

53:39.140 --> 53:40.876
I Just Sat Down And
They Said I Could Go.

53:40.910 --> 53:43.245
But You Were There For
Almost Two Hours.

53:43.279 --> 53:44.447
Are You Sure?

53:44.479 --> 53:47.816
Yeah. I Mean, You
Missed Math And P.E.

53:47.850 --> 53:50.086
Personally, I'd Be Doing A
Victory Dance Right About Now.

53:52.654 --> 53:53.790
See You Later.

54:07.203 --> 54:10.807
Here, Scott.
They Wanted To Make Sure I Gave This One To You.

54:10.839 --> 54:15.377
Now, Forget, Tonight's Homework
Must Be Done With A Parent.

54:21.484 --> 54:23.386
It's Her?

54:32.328 --> 54:34.564
Scott, Watch Where
You're Going.

54:34.596 --> 54:36.899
Why Don't You Watch
Where You're Going?

54:36.932 --> 54:38.500
Sorry. I'd Love To
Stay And Chat,

54:38.533 --> 54:39.635
But I Gotta Go.

54:44.339 --> 54:47.743
And I'm Positive It Was The
Same Woman From The Fire

54:47.776 --> 54:50.178
That Was Getting Into The
Software Company Van.

54:50.212 --> 54:52.381
Strange Coincidence.

54:52.413 --> 54:54.716
The Police Never Found Her
After You Set Her Down.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.252
And When I Went
To The Office,

54:56.285 --> 54:57.720
I Thought I Was There
For Two Minutes.

54:57.752 --> 54:59.421
But Randy Said I Was
There For Two Hours.

54:59.455 --> 55:01.624
They Called You
Into The Office?

55:01.656 --> 55:03.258
Not Because I
Was In Trouble,

55:03.292 --> 55:04.694
But The President Of
Earth Protectors

55:04.727 --> 55:06.162
Wanted To Talk
To Me Personally.

55:06.194 --> 55:09.664
Remember You Said Somebody Was
Using A Mind-Control Device?

55:09.698 --> 55:11.000
Well, This Is It.

55:14.870 --> 55:17.507
Scott, I Don't Think
Anybody Is Trying

55:17.540 --> 55:19.308
To Take Over The Minds
Of Your Junior High.

55:19.341 --> 55:21.743
Yeah, You're All Already
Pretty Mindless.

55:21.776 --> 55:24.146
Ok, But What About When
Everybody Wore Blue?

55:24.180 --> 55:27.183
And Maybe It's Why You
Think I Took The Money.

55:27.216 --> 55:28.683
Ha. Here
We Go.

55:28.716 --> 55:30.586
I Knew It'd Get
Back To That.

55:30.618 --> 55:33.722
Please. Just Look At It.

55:33.756 --> 55:36.091
They Insisted That I Do
It With My Parents.

55:36.125 --> 55:39.829
Ok. Adam, Man The Plug.

55:39.861 --> 55:42.964
If Anything Weird
Happens, Blast It.

55:42.997 --> 55:44.133
I'm On It.

55:45.533 --> 55:49.538
<I>Welcome To Earth Protectors.

55:49.571 --> 55:53.308
<I>Hi, Kids. Today's Lesson
Is About Compost.

55:53.341 --> 55:58.480
<I>There's Nothing I Like More
Than A Big Serving Of Garbage.

55:58.513 --> 56:00.749
<I>So, Kids, Let's Have Fun...

56:00.783 --> 56:02.585
I'm Sure Any Minute Now,

56:02.618 --> 56:05.388
This Thing'll Convince You To Take
Over The World Or Something.

56:08.957 --> 56:11.459
Scott.

56:11.493 --> 56:14.464
You've Got To Take Responsibility
For Your Actions, Son.

56:17.732 --> 56:18.834
Wait.

56:18.868 --> 56:20.436
Wait!

56:20.468 --> 56:24.206
Mom, You're Supposed To Watch This
And Help Me With My Homework.

56:30.145 --> 56:32.248
<I>Welcome To Earth Protectors.

56:32.281 --> 56:35.484
<I>Listen Very Carefully To The
Following Instructions.

56:35.517 --> 56:38.821
<I>Earth Protectors Will Tell
You Exactly What To Do.

56:38.854 --> 56:41.890
<I>Earth Protectors Will Tell You Exactly What To Do.

56:50.598 --> 56:51.667
Good Morning, Ma'am.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.236
Good Morning, Sir.

56:57.473 --> 57:00.343
Excuse Me.
Can I Have Everyone's Attention, Please?

57:00.375 --> 57:03.278
This Is A Hold-Up.

57:06.615 --> 57:09.852
Where's Bronze Eagle?
Where Are They?

57:09.884 --> 57:12.988
Where Are They? They Should
Be Here By Now If It Worked.

57:13.022 --> 57:15.691
The Program Just Said,
Wake Up, Get Dressed,

57:15.723 --> 57:17.192
And Report Here For
Further Instructions.

57:17.225 --> 57:19.028
Nothing Complicated.

57:19.060 --> 57:21.564
Oh, I Asked Them To Run A Few
Errands For Me On The Way.

57:22.997 --> 57:25.166
Well, I Figured They Might As
Well Make Themselves Useful.

57:25.200 --> 57:28.604
Malcolm, Adult Minds Are Almost Impossible To Control.

57:28.636 --> 57:30.673
I Mean, The More
Complicated...

57:30.705 --> 57:32.741
[Crash]

57:32.774 --> 57:34.175
Sounds Like Them Now.

57:34.209 --> 57:36.011
Hello?

57:36.044 --> 57:38.981
Mrs. Rosen Here,
Reporting For Duty.

57:42.151 --> 57:44.086
What Is Going On Here?

57:44.118 --> 57:45.754
I Have No Idea.

57:45.787 --> 57:47.423
Ok, Don't Worry. I'll
Take Care Of It.

57:47.455 --> 57:49.091
You Just Go See What's
Wrong With That Program.

57:49.124 --> 57:50.826
I'll Handle
This. I Will.

57:53.662 --> 57:56.131
I Think We Need To Take A
More Direct Approach.

57:57.066 --> 57:58.834
Thank You, Dear.

57:58.866 --> 58:00.336
Thank You.

58:02.404 --> 58:05.141
Scott, This Isn't The Disc
I Gave You Yesterday.

58:05.174 --> 58:06.976
It's Not?

58:07.008 --> 58:10.078
Remember, Yours Was Different
From Everybody Else's.

58:10.111 --> 58:11.780
Miss Parker.

58:11.814 --> 58:13.415
Scott, Did You Hear?

58:13.448 --> 58:15.250
Amy's Mom Robbed The Bank.

58:15.283 --> 58:16.184
What?!

58:16.218 --> 58:17.520
Boys, Settle Down.

58:17.553 --> 58:20.923
Yeah, The Police Are Out
Looking For Her Right Now.

58:20.955 --> 58:23.758
She Must've Gotten My
Disc When We Fell.

58:23.792 --> 58:25.828
Come On, I Gotta Go.

58:25.861 --> 58:27.930
Uh, The Bell
Has Rung.

58:27.962 --> 58:29.832
What's Going On?

58:29.865 --> 58:32.935
Uh, Sick. Very Sick.

58:32.968 --> 58:36.372
Gotta Go. Randy Is Too.

58:36.404 --> 58:39.408
Sick. Sick. Oh!
Ooh, Tummy!

58:39.441 --> 58:41.678
Oh, Head! Oh!
Uh, Come On!

58:42.544 --> 58:44.446
Randy! Scott!

58:44.479 --> 58:47.349
Hey, Scott, You
Know, At My House

58:47.383 --> 58:49.685
When There's An Emergency,
We Do The Kookiest Thing--

58:49.718 --> 58:52.922
We Call 9-1-1, Ok?
Not Our Grandparents.

58:52.955 --> 58:53.823
<I>You Were Right, Scott.

58:53.855 --> 58:54.957
I Knew It!

58:54.990 --> 58:55.857
<I>E.P. Headquarters.

58:55.890 --> 58:56.358
<I>You Know Where That Is?

58:56.392 --> 58:57.560
Yes.

58:57.593 --> 58:58.493
<I>They've All Gone To
That Location.

58:58.526 --> 59:00.829
It's Gotta Be A Trap.

59:00.863 --> 59:02.498
<I>Well, I'm Gonna Provide
Some Backup, Just In Case.

59:02.531 --> 59:04.533
Ok, I'll Meet You There.
All Right. Bye.

59:04.566 --> 59:06.067
Come On!

59:06.100 --> 59:09.171
It's Just As I Thought.
The Kids Are In Trouble.

59:09.203 --> 59:10.805
They All Got
Emergency Pages

59:10.839 --> 59:12.942
From A Place Called
Earth Protectors.

59:12.975 --> 59:14.810
Scott Thinks
It's A Set-Up.

59:14.843 --> 59:16.245
Well, We Better
Call Somebody.

59:16.278 --> 59:18.446
The Fantastic Four.
Superman--

59:18.479 --> 59:22.150
Superman?
You Think Superman Could Do A Better Job Than Me?

59:24.553 --> 59:25.821
Do You Know
Who I Am?

59:27.756 --> 59:29.024
I'm...

59:29.058 --> 59:31.994
I-I'm...

59:32.026 --> 59:33.361
Aahhhh!

59:33.395 --> 59:35.898
Eeahhhh!

59:35.930 --> 59:37.732
I'm Steel Condor!

59:37.765 --> 59:39.167
Condor!

59:39.200 --> 59:41.069
Condor!

59:41.102 --> 59:43.905
I Hope You Don't Expect Me To
Sew All Those Buttons Back On.

59:43.939 --> 59:45.707
Up, Up And Away!

59:47.875 --> 59:51.346
Up... Up... And Awayyyy!

59:51.379 --> 59:53.115
Ah, I Better Get
A Running Start.

59:55.316 --> 59:56.618
Watch Out For That...

59:56.651 --> 59:58.253
Aaahhhh!

59:58.287 --> 59:59.489
Fence.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:10.066
Looks Like We've All Been Invited To The Same Party.

01:00:10.098 --> 01:00:11.834
And Earth Protectors,
Whoever They Are,

01:00:11.866 --> 01:00:12.834
Is Throwing It.

01:00:12.868 --> 01:00:15.071
Maybe We Owe Scott An Apology.

01:00:17.538 --> 01:00:18.640
Let's Go.

01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:48.671
A Little Theatrical,
Don't You Think?

01:00:48.703 --> 01:00:50.406
Yes. It Is Theatrical.

01:00:54.243 --> 01:00:55.178
Aaahhhh!

01:01:00.214 --> 01:01:01.517
A Cage?

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.053
I Gotta Tell You,

01:01:05.087 --> 01:01:08.057
I Wasn't Sure If This Cage Was
Going To Be Able To Hold You Guys.

01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:11.559
Well, Considering The Bars Are
Made Out Of Aluminum Foil.

01:01:11.593 --> 01:01:13.028
But...

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.997
I Guess That's All Just
Part Of The Game, Huh?

01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:17.466
What Exactly Is
Your Game?

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:19.234
Brainwashing Kids?

01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:20.702
What's Going On?

01:01:20.736 --> 01:01:22.471
Kidnapping Housewives?

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:25.174
Stop Me When I'm Warm.

01:01:25.207 --> 01:01:28.344
Malcolm! What Are You Doing?

01:01:28.377 --> 01:01:30.980
What Is All Of This?

01:01:31.013 --> 01:01:33.749
Look, Bronze Eagle,
You've Got It All Wrong.

01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:35.484
We're Not Criminals.

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:39.288
Really, We're Not.
We're Just Trying To Make The World A Better Place.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:41.156
If You'll Just Give Me A
Couple Minutes To Explain--

01:01:41.189 --> 01:01:44.059
Nina! Shut Up!

01:01:48.462 --> 01:01:51.566
My Delusional And
Altruistic Friend Here,

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.836
Constantly Fails To
See The True Potential

01:01:53.868 --> 01:01:54.870
Of Her Own Invention.

01:01:56.805 --> 01:01:58.908
I Hope I Don't Come
Off Overly Cautious.

01:01:58.941 --> 01:02:02.011
What With All The Aluminum
Foil And Whatnot.

01:02:14.957 --> 01:02:17.026
Amy, I Don't Have
Time To Explain,

01:02:17.058 --> 01:02:19.495
But Your Mother Didn't
Really Rob That Bank.

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:21.497
How Do You Know That?

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:24.200
I'm Pretty Sure It's Part Of
A Plot To Capture My Parents.

01:02:24.232 --> 01:02:26.234
What Are You Talking About?

01:02:26.267 --> 01:02:28.236
Look, But You Have To
Trust Me On This--

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:30.372
You Remember That Kid On
The Side Of The Building?

01:02:30.404 --> 01:02:31.540
The Dorky One?

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.975
Well, That Was Me.

01:02:34.977 --> 01:02:36.379
Come On!

01:02:48.122 --> 01:02:53.528
Steel Condor To The Rescue!

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.169
Maybe I Should Have Taken A Cab.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:21.957
Adam, Right?

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:27.495
You're... Totally Fried...
When I Get Out Of Here.

01:03:27.529 --> 01:03:29.999
You Know, With Your
Powers At My Disposal,

01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:31.966
I'll Have No Trouble Eventually
Controlling The Mind

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.769
Of Every Consumer In The World.

01:03:33.801 --> 01:03:36.171
What Makes You Think
We'll Cooperate?

01:03:37.673 --> 01:03:39.207
I Don't.

01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:41.810
But, In Another Minute Or
Two With This Aluminum Foil

01:03:41.843 --> 01:03:42.978
Soaking Up All Your Energy,

01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:44.247
You'll Be Too Weak
To Resist Anything.

01:03:45.279 --> 01:03:47.749
Malcolm, Why Are
You Doing This?

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:50.353
Nina, Gimme The Disc.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.587
No.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.523
I Can't Believe I've
Been Such An Idiot.

01:03:55.557 --> 01:03:58.192
I Thought That You And I
Shared The Same Dream.

01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.861
Nina, Look,

01:03:59.895 --> 01:04:02.163
There's No Reason We Both Can't
Accomplish Our Dreams Here, Ok?

01:04:03.397 --> 01:04:05.133
I Should Have Known The
Day I Caught You Drinking

01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:07.403
Out Of That Styrofoam Cup.

01:04:07.435 --> 01:04:10.038
Hey, There Were
So Many Signs.

01:04:10.071 --> 01:04:12.240
I Mean, All Those
Beef Jerky Wrappers,

01:04:12.274 --> 01:04:14.310
And That Leather Belt You
Told Me Came From A Cow

01:04:14.343 --> 01:04:15.978
That Died Of
Natural Causes.

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.285
Get Her Outta Here, Please.

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:25.388
Maybe We're Recycle Her Later.

01:04:28.857 --> 01:04:30.559
What Were We Talking About?

01:04:41.136 --> 01:04:42.104
Look!

01:04:42.136 --> 01:04:43.638
There's My Mom's
Motorcycle.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:44.807
I Was Right!

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.341
That's Your Mom's?

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.911
Aw, Geez, My Mom
Drives A Hatchback.

01:04:48.944 --> 01:04:52.181
Hey, There's My
Mom's Station Wagon.

01:04:52.214 --> 01:04:54.982
Ok, I Feel A Little
Bit Better.

01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:57.251
Ah, Where's
My Grandpa?

01:04:57.285 --> 01:05:00.288
He Should Have Been
Here By Now.

01:05:00.321 --> 01:05:02.357
We Need His
Reinforcements.

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.825
Scott, If My Mom's In There,

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:05.394
We Can't Just Stand
Out Here And Wait.

01:05:05.426 --> 01:05:06.729
Let's Go.

01:05:06.761 --> 01:05:07.962
Wait. What Are You
Guys Talking About?

01:05:07.995 --> 01:05:08.963
We Can't Go In There, Ok?

01:05:08.997 --> 01:05:10.065
I Mean, We're Not Superheros.

01:05:10.098 --> 01:05:11.866
No Super Powers.
Rawk! Rawk! Rawk!

01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:15.069
So What, Randy.
You Don't Need Super Powers To Help People.

01:05:15.102 --> 01:05:16.504
Now Come On!

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:18.773
Guys, I'm Probably Not
Your Best Bet Here--

01:05:18.807 --> 01:05:20.475
Come On!

01:05:20.508 --> 01:05:21.376
Guys! No. No. No.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.096
Sshhhh!

01:05:50.372 --> 01:05:51.839
At This Point,

01:05:51.872 --> 01:05:54.008
I Probably Shouldn't
Be Surprised,

01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:57.011
But Your Parents Are Bronze
Eagle And Warrior Woman?

01:05:57.044 --> 01:05:59.046
Yeah, You Got A
Problem With That?

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.652
No. Just, Uh, Wondering Why They
Never Came To Career Day, Right?

01:06:03.685 --> 01:06:05.921
So, That Really Was You On
The Side Of That Building?

01:06:05.953 --> 01:06:09.158
Yeah.
Saving People Is Kind Of A Family Business.

01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:11.160
But You're Not A
Superhero, Right?

01:06:11.192 --> 01:06:13.294
Right. How'd You
Know That?

01:06:13.328 --> 01:06:15.130
Well, You'd Expect A
Superhero To Make A Goal

01:06:15.162 --> 01:06:16.664
Every Once In A While.

01:06:18.133 --> 01:06:21.703
Hello. Hi.
Yeah, Can We Just Get A Little Bit Of Focus Here?

01:06:21.736 --> 01:06:23.672
I Mean,
You Have The Entire 7th Grade To Stare At Each Other.

01:06:23.705 --> 01:06:24.607
Am I Right?

01:06:31.111 --> 01:06:33.581
We Just Have To Distract
Them Long Enough

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.783
To Get Into That Cage.

01:06:35.816 --> 01:06:38.953
And Them We Have To Get The
Cuff Off My Folks, Ok?

01:06:38.986 --> 01:06:41.856
Oh, Shoot. And Me
Without My Welding Gun.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:43.558
It's Just Aluminum Foil.

01:06:44.392 --> 01:06:45.660
Long Story.

01:06:45.694 --> 01:06:47.129
And The Distracting
Part?

01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:51.133
Don't Worry. I Think
I Got A Plan.

01:06:51.165 --> 01:06:52.434
Great.

01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:56.805
Now, We're Going To Have
A Little Training Video.

01:07:07.848 --> 01:07:10.486
Don't Move! We've
Got You Surrounded!

01:07:13.187 --> 01:07:14.455
Take One Step,

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:17.492
And We'll Be Forced
To Open Fire!

01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:18.826
Nah, They're Bluffing.

01:07:18.859 --> 01:07:20.261
Don't Worry About It.

01:07:22.397 --> 01:07:23.332
Aaahhhhh!

01:07:33.008 --> 01:07:34.308
Where Are They?

01:07:34.341 --> 01:07:36.110
I Don't Know.

01:07:36.144 --> 01:07:37.779
Where's It
Coming From?

01:07:37.812 --> 01:07:39.181
Come On!

01:07:40.982 --> 01:07:42.184
Get Up!

01:07:42.216 --> 01:07:44.752
What? What Was It?

01:07:44.785 --> 01:07:46.153
Come On. Let's Go.
It's Those Kids.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:47.589
They're Around Here Somewhere.
Find 'Em. Let's Go!

01:07:52.761 --> 01:07:54.830
Anybody Up For A
Double Dutch?

01:07:55.497 --> 01:07:56.332
Go Get 'Em!

01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:04.639
Come On!

01:08:06.707 --> 01:08:09.243
Wait! Stand Back!

01:08:09.276 --> 01:08:11.746
Ah, Yeah...
'Cause, Ah...

01:08:11.779 --> 01:08:13.314
One Step Closer,

01:08:13.348 --> 01:08:16.484
And You Unleash The
Powers Of... The...

01:08:16.518 --> 01:08:18.053
Randinator!

01:08:18.085 --> 01:08:20.688
Yeah! 'Cause I'm Your
Worst Nightmare, Ok?

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:22.424
I Have More Powers--

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:26.727
Powerrrrrs

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.662
Than You've Ever Dreamed Of!

01:08:28.697 --> 01:08:32.000
And You Know What?
There's Nothing You Can Do To Hurt Me.

01:08:32.032 --> 01:08:35.002
But There's A Millions Different
Things I Can Do To Hurt You!

01:08:35.036 --> 01:08:37.439
Whaaaaa!

01:08:39.608 --> 01:08:40.908
Whaaaaaa!

01:08:40.942 --> 01:08:43.278
This Stuff. Yeah,
Come On, Tough Guy.

01:08:43.310 --> 01:08:44.712
I Can Eat This Stuff
For Breakfast, Huh?

01:08:46.014 --> 01:08:47.515
Oww! My Filling.

01:08:47.549 --> 01:08:48.350
Ow, Oh!

01:08:48.383 --> 01:08:49.550
Come Over Here!

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:51.319
So, I Guess That
Leaves You.

01:08:51.353 --> 01:08:52.621
I Got Him.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.523
Scott, You've
Got To Save Us.

01:08:54.555 --> 01:08:55.823
What Are You Doing?

01:08:55.857 --> 01:08:57.326
Sorry, Kid. I Know
The Foil Hurts,

01:08:57.358 --> 01:08:59.493
But I Can't Have You
Messing Up Our Plans.

01:08:59.527 --> 01:09:01.063
Play Along.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.229
Ah, My Powers!

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.633
Get Him Out Of Here.

01:09:04.666 --> 01:09:06.135
Aahh. Oohhh.

01:09:08.202 --> 01:09:09.671
<I>Our Plans?

01:09:10.639 --> 01:09:12.073
You Can't Do
This Without Me.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.776
There's No Way I'm Letting
You Get Rich Off My Program.

01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:16.511
Besides, With My
Half Of The Money,

01:09:16.544 --> 01:09:18.779
I'll Just Buy The
Stupid Rain Forest.

01:09:18.813 --> 01:09:22.651
Nina, I Think I
Underestimated You.

01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:31.326
Three More Minutes And
Their Minds Belong To Me.

01:09:31.358 --> 01:09:32.760
Us.

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:35.798
What...? What Is That Doing?

01:09:36.729 --> 01:09:38.300
What Is That? What
Just Happened?

01:09:38.332 --> 01:09:39.901

While I Go Take Care
Of His Friends.

01:11:59.674 --> 01:12:01.343
That's My Wife.

01:12:03.077 --> 01:12:04.113
Ooohhh.

01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:12.187
Scott, I Just Want To Say That I'm Really Proud Of You.

01:12:12.219 --> 01:12:14.155
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:14.188 --> 01:12:15.557
And It's Like I Said,

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:19.560
You Don't Need Super Powers To Be A Superhero.

01:12:19.594 --> 01:12:22.064
Yeah, But I Sure Would
Have Been A Lot Easier.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:28.068
That Should Take Care Of
Any Lingering Memories

01:12:28.102 --> 01:12:30.005
Of Our Identities.

01:12:30.037 --> 01:12:32.273
You Know, If You
Guys Could Destroy

01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:33.608
The Rest Of The
Discs As Well,

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.376
I'd Really Appreciate It.

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:38.513
I Realize You Can't Force
A Person To Do Something.

01:12:38.545 --> 01:12:41.515
And I Think I'd Like To Go
Back To Saving The World

01:12:41.549 --> 01:12:43.719
One Bag Of Garbage At A Time.

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:47.254
Thanks For
Saving My Mom.

01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:49.057
You Were Awesome.

01:12:49.090 --> 01:12:50.692
Thanks.

01:12:50.724 --> 01:12:53.227
Uh, I Would Ask
You Something,

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.831
But I Don't Want You To Think It's
Just Because You Saved My Life.

01:12:56.865 --> 01:12:59.367
'Cause I Liked You
Before You Did That.

01:13:00.768 --> 01:13:01.970
But There's This Dance--

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:03.638
Yes!

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.240
Really?

01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:08.710
Yes! I Wanted To Ask You, But I
Didn't Think You Liked Me.

01:13:08.742 --> 01:13:10.245
No Way! I Thought
You Didn't Like Me.

01:13:10.277 --> 01:13:11.879
No Way!

01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:14.282
Adam, Don't.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:16.617
Mom? Dad?

01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:19.254
Scott, She'll Be Fine.
She Just Won't Remember

01:13:19.286 --> 01:13:21.222
Anything That Happened In
The Last Couple Of Hours.

01:13:21.255 --> 01:13:23.157
Now, She's Not Going To
Remember She Likes Me.

01:13:23.191 --> 01:13:25.527
If She Liked You Before,
It Shouldn't Matter.

01:13:27.694 --> 01:13:29.063
Whoa! All Right,
Down, Sparky!

01:13:29.096 --> 01:13:30.898
I Mean, Look,
I Need All The Brain Cells I Can Get.

01:13:30.932 --> 01:13:32.300
All Right? I Mean--

01:13:32.332 --> 01:13:35.036
Guys? Wait, Guys, Look. I
Promise Not To Tell Anybody.

01:13:35.068 --> 01:13:36.737
I Mean Look, Who Would
Believe Me, Right?

01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:39.041
I Don't Even Believe Me. You
Guys Don't Believe Me And--

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:41.843
You Know, You Guys Owe Me.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:45.213
Ok? I Mean, I Practically Saved
Your Lives. Waaaaooo, Remember?

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.349
Can I Zap Him Just
To Shut Him Up?

01:13:47.381 --> 01:13:49.183
We Couldn't Have
Done It Without Him.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.886
It Would Be Nice For Scott To
Have Someone To Talk To.

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:54.956
Ok.

01:13:54.988 --> 01:13:55.890
Yes!

01:13:57.425 --> 01:13:59.394
Whoooo! Ok, Come On.

01:13:59.426 --> 01:14:01.862
Honey, Is This A Bad Time To Talk About The Laundry?

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:04.465
You're Putting Way Too
Much Starch In My--

01:14:05.633 --> 01:14:06.667
Aahhhhh!

01:14:06.701 --> 01:14:08.370
Steel Condor!

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:10.037
I'm Here To Save The Day!

01:14:11.339 --> 01:14:12.741
Uh, Dad, Dad, Dad.

01:14:12.773 --> 01:14:14.475
You're Late.

01:14:14.509 --> 01:14:16.712
Darn! I Knew I Should
Have Taken A Cab.

01:14:18.979 --> 01:14:20.447
I Better Sit Down.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.416
Oh, Right Over Here.

01:14:30.692 --> 01:14:33.662
Now, All We Have To Do
Is Light The Campfire.

01:14:33.694 --> 01:14:35.930
Don't Even Think About It,
You Little Fire-Starter.

01:14:35.964 --> 01:14:37.399
You Know You're Not
Supposed To Do That.

01:14:37.432 --> 01:14:41.068
Who Appointed You,
Smokey The Bear?

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:43.672
Hey?

01:14:43.705 --> 01:14:44.573
Hey, Amy?

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.342
Pretty Exciting Day, Huh?

01:14:47.375 --> 01:14:49.243
What's That Supposed To Mean?

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:52.781
Your Mom Robbing The Bank, And
Finding Out She Was Brainwashed?

01:14:52.813 --> 01:14:55.349
Good Thing Bronze Eagle And
Warrior Woman Showed Up.

01:14:55.383 --> 01:14:57.184
Yeah, It Was Really Lucky.

01:14:58.152 --> 01:14:59.054
Amy?

01:15:01.488 --> 01:15:02.991
Uh...

01:15:03.023 --> 01:15:04.425
Good Luck Today.

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:06.661
Thanks. You Too.

01:15:06.693 --> 01:15:08.129
Try Not To Choke, Ok?

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:11.299
So Much For Remembering.

01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:18.907
Is That Burning Rubber I Smell?

01:15:20.608 --> 01:15:21.643
Molly!

01:15:24.511 --> 01:15:25.714
Aahhh!

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.448
Mom!

01:15:28.616 --> 01:15:29.917
Mom!

01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:31.953
Ok, Let's Vote For
Team Captain Now.

01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:35.924

01:15:35.956 --> 01:15:37.358
Amy.

01:15:40.193 --> 01:15:41.462
Scott.

01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:42.497
What?

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.133
Well, Congratulations, Scott.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:46.334
You're Ahead By One Vote,

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:47.769
And You're The Only
One Who Hasn't Voted.

01:15:47.801 --> 01:15:49.203
Ha, Yeah.

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:52.506
Amy.

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:54.576
What?

01:15:54.608 --> 01:15:56.477
I Vote For Amy.

01:15:57.144 --> 01:15:59.013
All Tied Up Then.

01:15:59.046 --> 01:16:01.515
You Two Ok With
Being Co-Captains?

01:16:01.549 --> 01:16:03.885
Yep.
Yep.

01:16:05.286 --> 01:16:07.822
You Must Be
Very Proud.

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:09.290
I Am.

01:16:09.322 --> 01:16:10.491
Let's Play
Some Ball.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.593
All Right.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.229
Hey, You Know, I
Was Thinking...

01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:15.462
Don't You Need
A Sidekick?

01:16:15.496 --> 01:16:17.232
I Mean, Every Great
Superhero Has One.

01:16:17.264 --> 01:16:19.867
You Know, The Cool Wise-Cracking
Friend That Just Follows Him Around?

01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:22.336
Randy? I'm Not A
Superhero.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:25.640
So, Neither Was The Lone Ranger,
But He Had Tonto, Huh?

01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:27.442
Ok, You Want
To Be Tonto?

01:16:27.474 --> 01:16:29.276
Actually, No.

01:16:29.309 --> 01:16:31.245
But I'd Like To Be
That Kato Guy.

01:16:31.278 --> 01:16:32.546
You Know, The Guy From
The Green Hornet?

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.848
I Mean The Green
Hornet Was One

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.816
Of The Coolest
Superheros Of All.

01:16:35.849 --> 01:16:37.218
Yeah, He Is A
Pretty Nice Guy.

01:16:37.251 --> 01:16:38.053
I Like Him A Lot.

01:16:38.085 --> 01:16:39.186
You Know Him?

01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:41.255
Know Him? He Came To
My Birthday Party.

01:16:42.305 --> 01:16:48.496
