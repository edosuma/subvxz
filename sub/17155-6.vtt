00:02.041 --> 00:03.208

Rock star Joe, welcome to my movie.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.041
[applause]

00:08.125 --> 00:11.375
You just seem different this summer.
Good different.

00:11.458 --> 00:14.583
If you like a girl, you should tell her,

00:14.667 --> 00:17.125
so she's not confused
by the messages you're sending.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.291
What I'm trying to say is I like you.

00:19.375 --> 00:22.291
This is crazy.
You're a rock star

00:22.375 --> 00:24.375
-and I'm your--
-Macy.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.458
I'm your Macy.

00:26.542 --> 00:29.917
-I like the sound of that.
-Me too.

00:37.291 --> 00:39.041
I can't look.
Just tell me when it's over!

00:39.125 --> 00:40.542
It's almost there.
Just hang on.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.375

I can't look!

-[man] <i>Oh, and he got away.</i>
-Oh, thank goodness.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.041
Wow, I never knew pro bass fishing
could be this exciting.

00:50.125 --> 00:53.000
-I know and I always root for the fish.
-That's so you.

00:53.083 --> 00:55.542
You're so sweet pretending
you care about the show.

00:55.625 --> 00:56.458
I'm not pretending.

00:56.542 --> 00:57.625
And you're so sweet
to say you're not pretending

00:57.709 --> 00:58.792
when you're totally pretending.

00:58.875 --> 01:01.083
-Hey, guys, what's going on over here?
-Uh, just a show.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.834
-Tense moment.
-On a fishing show?

01:02.917 --> 01:05.458
-It's pro bass fishing.
-How does the bass go pro?

01:05.542 --> 01:08.250
-Yeah, a bass is a fish.
-No, the fishermen are the pros.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.417
-These fish are amateurs.
-Joe, I was making a joke.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.792
Oh, it's kinda hard to tell with you.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.000
It's just a really good show.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.917
Really?
Well, let's watch it.

-Somewhere.
-Ooh, I want to watch <i>Miss Tyra.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:25.625
-What? No!
-Give me that. Give it back.

01:25.709 --> 01:27.125
-I said sports.
-No!

-Sounds great, man.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.083
No, it doesn't because
it's missing something like,

03:35.166 --> 03:37.500
I don't know, the rest of the band.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.250
Nick, seriously, how many times
are we gonna record this track?

03:40.333 --> 03:43.500
-It sounds fine.
-Fine isn't good enough.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.333
You know what would make it better?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.333
-Words.
-Yeah, put some of those in.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.250
All right, the lyrics
need to fit the music

03:49.333 --> 03:50.750

03:50.834 --> 03:53.458
Dude, admit it, you're blocked.

03:53.542 --> 03:55.208
When you're blocked you're no fun.

03:55.709 --> 03:58.417
I'm lots of fun.
I'm a really fun guy.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.875
Like, remember that one time
I got those wrestling tickets?

04:00.959 --> 04:03.125
You hate wrestling.
You didn't even come with us.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, but I had a great time
getting the tickets.

04:06.083 --> 04:10.583
And they came three weeks in advance.
Three weeks... in advance.

04:11.375 --> 04:13.834
Well, Nick, while you enjoy
reliving the good times,

04:13.917 --> 04:15.709
we're gonna have fun on our vacation.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.792
I like advanced planning.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.208
Chuck, this is gonna be so cool.

04:26.291 --> 04:28.750
I'm so excited to start punching stuff.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.625
Let me guess, first movie fight?

04:30.709 --> 04:34.333
Well, <i>Forever April</i>
is my first movie, so, yeah.

04:34.417 --> 04:37.083
OK. OK, we're all set.
Ready to get to work?

04:37.166 --> 04:38.625
I am so ready to get to work.

04:38.709 --> 04:41.667
I'm gonna be fighting an evil ghost,
so I want to make it look totally awesome.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.875
Ah, don't worry. I've trained cowboys,
gladiators, angry aliens;

04:44.959 --> 04:46.792
and that's just at a Halloween party.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.458
So, like, you're a funny fight trainer?

04:49.542 --> 04:52.250
I do a little standup on the side.
It's Hollywood, you know?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.542
-Gotcha.
-Yeah.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.917
Why don't we just jump in, you know?
Maybe some punches, a little karate.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.542
Put 'em together
for a little mixed martial arts.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.625

-Ow!
-I usually start with some stretching.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.834
OK, let's stretch.

-Who are you?

05:18.208 --> 05:20.250
I'm the one telling you
that the track is whack.

05:20.333 --> 05:23.959
OK, random kid in my house,
what's wrong with my track?

05:24.041 --> 05:25.834
It's not hot.
No flavor.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.917
Not hot.
And what do you know?

05:29.000 --> 05:33.208
[chuckles] I know that your track
sounds like water tastes, flat.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.917
I see you've met my niece, Kiara.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.709
Oh, that's who you are.
Well, it's really nice to meet you.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.875
-Come back again soon, OK?
-Oh, she's staying.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.166
And you're watching her.

where are you going?

05:45.041 --> 05:46.917

You, behave.
You, double behave.

05:57.542 --> 06:00.125
Listen, Nick, we got a lot in common.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.625
I'm a singer, too.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.834
Oh, really?
That's cute.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.458
Yeah?
You ready to hear me?

06:05.542 --> 06:07.291
Actually, I'm a little busy today.

06:07.375 --> 06:10.208
But I know a couple people
who would love to meet you.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.041
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.542
I was just thinking about you.

06:16.625 --> 06:18.500
-Hello.
-Well, hello!

06:18.583 --> 06:22.333
I was just thinking about you
and your web interview

06:22.417 --> 06:25.500
for the fans who miss you so much.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.792
Oh, who's this?

06:27.875 --> 06:30.667
Macy, Stella,
meet Big Man's niece, Kiara.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.083
Kiara, meet Macy and Stella.

06:32.166 --> 06:34.291
Oh, what a little cutie!

06:34.375 --> 06:37.125
Little? How old do you think I am?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.333
Um, ten.

06:39.417 --> 06:41.083
-I'm 11.
-Spunky.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.792
You guys are gonna love her when you
watch her for me, all day. Please?

06:45.083 --> 06:47.959
He's just mad 'cause he won't take
my constructive criticism.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.417
My, what a large vocabulary you have.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.417
-Help.
-Nick, I got this.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.083
I have a very special connection
with children.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.959
Plus, I'm kinda young at heart myself.

06:59.583 --> 07:03.709
So, Kiara, little sweetie,
do you want to play dress-up today?

07:03.792 --> 07:07.583
You could be a princess
or a ballerina or a bunny.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.458
Are you for real?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.041
-You think she's onto us?
-Who, Stella?

07:14.125 --> 07:17.333
No, the kid. She gave us a weird look
when you opened the door.

07:17.417 --> 07:20.041
-So?
-We agreed to keep us a secret.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.000
-What if she spills it?
-Well, what if she does?

07:23.083 --> 07:25.333
Well, then we obviously
wouldn't be a secret couple anymore.

07:25.417 --> 07:28.375
-OK, sounds good to me.
-What?

07:28.458 --> 07:30.333
Nick, do you have any idea
how hard it is for a girl

07:30.417 --> 07:33.125
not to tell her best friend
about her super-secret boyfriend?

07:33.333 --> 07:34.291
No.

07:34.375 --> 07:36.750
I'll just say this:
it's never been done.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.834
I'm sorry.
It's hard for me, too.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.333
We don't want to end up
like Joe and Stella,

07:42.417 --> 07:46.041
everybody talking about their relationship
before it was even a relationship.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.750
They never had a chance.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.125
I know, but...

07:53.250 --> 07:55.583
Please, just be patient with me.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.458
-OK, fine.
-Thank you.

07:58.542 --> 08:01.125
-But I don't like it.

with the dress-up?

08:04.500 --> 08:06.500

Guys, guys, violence is never the answer.

08:17.458 --> 08:20.500
Dude, it's not real.
Chuck is my fight trainer for the movie.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.125
He's gonna make it look like
I can beat up a ghost.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.375
Can you even hit a ghost?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.458
Oh, wait, does your fist
go right through him?

08:27.542 --> 08:29.166
Well, it works in the movies.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.625
I don't really know
how it works in real life.

08:30.709 --> 08:33.125
-Joe, focus.
-Sorry.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.542
Right now we're working on
throwing a movie punch.

08:35.625 --> 08:38.291
Oh, is that when like you almost
hit somebody but you really don't?

08:38.375 --> 08:40.041
-Yeah. You want me to do it with you?
-Yeah.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.333
Guys, don't.
Someone always gets--

-[thuds]
-Hurt.

08:44.542 --> 08:47.333
-He leaned into it.
-I did not lean into it.

08:47.417 --> 08:49.375
Oh, you're gonna have to
put some ice on that.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.667
Yeah, my knuckles are feeling swollen.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.500
He's talking about my eye.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.834
Hey, you leaned into it.
Didn't he?

08:55.917 --> 08:57.625
I don't know, man,
but I don't have all day.

08:57.709 --> 08:58.959
I got to train
some vampires in the valley.

08:59.041 --> 09:02.250
-Oh, cool, what movie?
-There is no movie.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.875
Whoa.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.750
It's a commercial, man.
Now, come on, hit me.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.083
-[grunting]
-Good.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.333
Good.

09:10.417 --> 09:15.166
[gasps] How cute
would these earrings look on Kiara?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.875
Oh, um, I don't know.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.625
So cute.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.458
I wore these on my date
with Ben last week.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.041
He loved them.
He told me so.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.417
Aww.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.208
-Macy...
-Uh-huh?

09:27.291 --> 09:28.583
We need to find you a boyfriend.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.041
-We do?
-Yes.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.208
-Oh.
-I mean, think about it.

09:31.291 --> 09:34.500
If you had a boyfriend we could, like,
go on double dates all the time.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.208
[laughs]
Um...

09:36.291 --> 09:38.917
I mean, we came to LA
to find love and romance.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.041
Look how well it worked out
for me and Ben.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.083
That's true.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.959
You and Ben have been
official for now what?

09:46.041 --> 09:51.125
Uh, 21 days, 17 hours and... 12 minutes.

09:51.834 --> 09:56.625
And when was Ben ready to, you know,
tell everyone about you guys?

09:56.709 --> 10:00.291
Oh, he was ready to make it official
after like the first date.

10:00.375 --> 10:04.041
I was the one that was like,
"Whoa, Ben, whoa."

10:04.125 --> 10:05.750
-Hey, here's a thought.
-Mm-hmm?

10:05.834 --> 10:07.875
Say there's this girl,
she's dating a boy.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.041
The boy doesn't want to tell anyone.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.709
Ew, that's gross.
I hate that.

10:11.792 --> 10:15.333
I mean, guys will brag about their burps,
but when it comes to girls they're like,

10:15.417 --> 10:17.333
"Oh, no, I'm too cool to be in love."

10:17.417 --> 10:20.166
Except for Ben, of course.
But a lot of guys are like that.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.959
Right.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.250
So, if the guy and the girl
are the only ones

10:25.333 --> 10:28.458
that know about the relationship,
I mean, is it even real?

10:29.375 --> 10:32.000
Well, yeah, it's real.
Real over.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.417
I mean, what kind of girl
is gonna put up with that?

10:34.500 --> 10:37.875
-A nice one?
-And the guy, he's a jerk.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.834
Or he's just complicated.
You don't know the whole story.

10:40.917 --> 10:43.291
-Why are you being so judgmental?
-Wait, hold up.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.125
Mace, are you trying to tell me something?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.875
[laughs]
What?!

10:46.959 --> 10:48.542
No. What? No.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.041
Don't we have a little girl
around here to dress or something?

10:53.125 --> 10:54.625
Yes, we do.

10:54.709 --> 10:58.083
Kiara, I hope your ears are pierced.

10:59.917 --> 11:02.125
Dude, tell me that's not
the last cherry pop.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.250
Sorry, I had a more urgent need for it.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.458
Whoa. I really clocked you.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.083
I guess I don't know my own strength.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.000
I can't believe you!
You're actually happy you hit me.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.709
I see what's going on here.
You're going to hold this over my head

11:14.792 --> 11:16.834
just like the time
I accidentally broke your toy train.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.125
Mr. Chooch meant everything to me!

11:18.208 --> 11:20.458
You were 17. Get over it.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.583
Fine, just tell me
what you're gonna do to make this right.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.083
If it'll shut you up, why don't you
just hit me and we'll call it even?

11:25.166 --> 11:27.542
-You want me to hit you?
-Yeah, in the arm. Go ahead.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.333
How is that even fair?
Look at my eye.

11:29.417 --> 11:31.208
Kevin, I'm an actor.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.333
My face is my instrument.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.709
All right, Joe, fine.
The face is off-limits.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.709
But I'm not gonna hit you now.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.875
You're just gonna hit me
when I least expect it?

11:41.959 --> 11:42.959
Perhaps.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.834
Or possibly when I least expect it.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.750
What does that even mean?

11:48.834 --> 11:50.542
Kiara.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.667
-Kiara?
-Where is she?

11:52.750 --> 11:54.667
Maybe she's playing hide-and-seek.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.875
Uh, no, Kiara's not
a hide-and-seek kind of girl.

11:57.959 --> 11:59.500
She's gone.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.625
Thank you, lady obvious.

12:01.667 --> 12:04.125
Big Man's gonna be big angry.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.667
Fan out!

12:07.875 --> 12:10.375
-Have you seen Kiara?
-I thought you were watching her.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.250
We were, and then she ran away.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.500
I mean, I've lost things before
but they were little things,

12:14.583 --> 12:15.500
like a lipstick or a bracelet.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.583
But I've never lost
an entire person before.

12:17.667 --> 12:20.625
-Don't worry, we'll find her.
-I'm so glad I have you.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.166
Busted!

12:23.250 --> 12:26.417
I just knew there was something
going on between you two.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.834
-That's ridiculous.
-Y'all are love doves.

12:28.917 --> 12:31.875
-Would you keep it down, please?
-Love doves! Coo, coo!

12:31.959 --> 12:33.959
Love doves!
Coo!

12:36.375 --> 12:38.709
[Kiara] Love doves!
Coo! Coo!

12:38.792 --> 12:40.625
Love doves!
[laughs]

12:40.709 --> 12:44.166
Oh, Nick, I'm so glad to have you.
You're so cute.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.166
That doesn't even sound like me!
Does it?

12:46.250 --> 12:47.542
No, of course not.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.458
Oh, I want to kiss you.
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.333
-Kiara, shh.
-Why?

12:51.417 --> 12:54.709
-Because it's none of your business.
-Oh, it's a secret.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.709
I love secrets,
but I'm bad at keeping them.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.583
Oh, Kiara, you had me so worried.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.875
Everything's fine.
It's all good. You found me.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.834
I hear that, girl.

13:08.959 --> 13:12.667
[clears throat]
Because you said it so clearly.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.000
All right, let's go style you up.

13:15.166 --> 13:17.125
Um, I want to hang with Nick.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.417
Oh, honey, Nick has a lot of work to do.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.166
Oh, yeah, I guess I should've
stayed with you guys.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.333
-Let's tell each other our secrets!
-[Stella] Yes!

13:25.458 --> 13:26.834
No! No.

13:26.917 --> 13:30.792
Big Man asked me to watch Kiara,
and I keep my promises.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.750
So come with me.
We're gonna go have a great time together.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.458
-Right?
-Yeah.

13:36.542 --> 13:40.000
-But I picked out earrings for you.
-Oh, honey, just let it go.

13:43.917 --> 13:45.750
All right, Nick, here's how I see it.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.709
You're a famous songwriter
and I'm an up-and-coming singer.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.750
OK.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.542
-I want to be on a Jonas song.
-With this Jonas?

13:53.625 --> 13:56.166
Really? Because as I recall it,
my tracks are whack.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.583
Oh, they are.
But if you sprinkle

13:58.667 --> 14:01.208
a little Kiara in that mix,
it's gonna blow up.

14:01.291 --> 14:02.917
All right, listen,
I know you think you can sing--

14:03.000 --> 14:07.458

for your love dove.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.542
-Maybe.
-Definitely.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.458
Now if you put me on your track,
let me give it a little flavor,

-[screams]
-Hello, brother.

15:16.709 --> 15:19.417
Will you just hit me already?
Just get it over with.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.542
That was it?
I didn't feel a thing.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.875
That's because
I didn't hit you yet, brother.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.333
Will you stop calling me brother?
It's freaking me out.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.875
But you are my brother, brother.

15:33.542 --> 15:36.625
Oh, yeah, still tender, brother.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.959
-I got it!
-You got what?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.208
The lyrics to the song.
You were right, it's about Macy.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.750

15:51.834 --> 15:54.917
Well, that is Kiara magic.
Check the beat I did for our new track.

16:00.333 --> 16:03.208
-[stops music]
-See? The track is no longer whack.

16:03.291 --> 16:05.750
-It's actually not bad.
-Now give me the words.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.166
It's time for me to lay down my vocals.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kiara, I'm singing.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.500
It's a song for my girlfriend.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.542
Yes, but you didn't even know
it was about your girlfriend

16:12.625 --> 16:15.000
-until I came along.
-Kiara, I'm singing the song.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.875
Nick, it's supposed
to be a collaboration.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.709
You know what?
You just don't understand music.

16:18.834 --> 16:20.709
[sighs]
Well, you don't understand women.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.667
-What?
-You have no idea how to work

16:22.750 --> 16:26.333
with a young, talented
female artiste like myself.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.250
And you keep your beautiful girlfriend
a secret from all your friends.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.125
Honestly, I don't know
what she sees in you.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.750
-Whoa, you just crossed the line.
-Like this?

16:33.834 --> 16:35.500
I am not getting in
a stare down with a kid.

16:35.583 --> 16:36.417
You already are.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.542
-No, I'm not.
-Then walk away.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.125
-You walk away.
-You walk away.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.875
You know what?
I'm gonna get some string cheese.

16:40.959 --> 16:45.041
And maybe if you were a little nicer,
I'd get you some, too. But no!

I'm just gonna hit myself.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.166
But that wouldn't count now, would it?

17:13.875 --> 17:16.625
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.458
All right, Kiara, I'm all cheddared up.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.667
Let's get back to work.
Where you going?

17:21.917 --> 17:23.709
I'm out.
Deal off.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.625
What? Why?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.959
Stop! Why?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.458
One, I don't like working with you.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.250
Two, you didn't bring me cheese.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.583
So you're gonna tell?

17:35.959 --> 17:37.750
[sighs]
No.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.208
Because that's not the way your friends
should find out you're with Macy.

-[cheering]
-[Kiara] That was great.

20:25.333 --> 20:26.709
Wow.

20:27.875 --> 20:32.542
Now in case you guys hadn't noticed,
I like Macy and Macy likes me.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.125
-Yeah.
-That was so romantic.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.750
-I knew all along.
-No, you didn't.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.041
I had no idea.
[chuckles]

20:41.125 --> 20:44.625
Hey, you two,
what's this situation all about?

20:47.792 --> 20:49.625
When did we get a kid?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.917
So, how long has this been going on?

20:57.041 --> 21:01.417
Fourteen days,
seven hours and 23 minutes.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.041
Not that we're counting.

21:03.125 --> 21:07.917
I can't believe you guys didn't tell me.
I want to be mad at you, but I can't.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.917
'Cause I'm so happy for you guys.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.500
-Aw, besties.
-But no more secret boyfriends.

21:13.583 --> 21:15.750
-You promise?
-Uh-huh.

21:15.834 --> 21:18.125
First day of massage school!

21:18.208 --> 21:22.208
Oh, I learned all about muscles and nerves
and how not to pinch 'em too hard.

21:22.291 --> 21:24.083
So, what'd I miss here?

21:24.166 --> 21:26.542
I hope no one started dating
any rock stars.

21:26.625 --> 21:28.959
-[laughing]
-[both] Well, um...

21:29.458 --> 21:31.500
No.
Oh, no.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.417
No. You two?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.583
I'm gone for one day.

21:35.667 --> 21:38.709
Well, I guess I can't leave this house.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.500
Goodbye, massage school.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.417
I hope I can get my money back.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.250
Just, Kevin, please get it over with.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.917
Do it now.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.709
Kevin, you're killing me already.
Just hit me.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.667
One, two, three, punch!

21:53.750 --> 21:55.417
Dude, come on, just hit me already!

21:55.500 --> 21:56.750
-[thuds]
-[Joe] Ow.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.834
[Macy]
<i>Next on</i> Jonas LA...

21:58.917 --> 22:01.208
-We're heading to the golf course today.
-Really? Can I come with?

22:01.291 --> 22:04.083
Macy, it's a lot harder than it looks.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.250
That was pretty bad.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.291
-Hey, guys.
-Hey!

22:07.375 --> 22:09.083
You guys, you remember Ben.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.667
You two should totally join us for lunch.

22:11.750 --> 22:12.834
Uh, yes.

22:12.917 --> 22:14.625
Does Ben know that you and I were...?

22:14.709 --> 22:16.667
-No! Does Vanessa know about...?
-No.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.083
Shiraki-san has arrived.

22:19.166 --> 22:20.834
-[gasps]
-Joe.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.583
-There you go.
-You rule.

22:22.667 --> 22:23.667
