WEBVTT

00:10.385 --> 00:12.595
On this episode,
we're off to Austin, Texas,

00:13.638 --> 00:16.516
to help the owner
of this struggling pool property.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.811
I had to move so quickly,
I didn't really have time to optimize it.

00:19.894 --> 00:24.190
The location is perfect,
but it's not living up to its potential.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.902
And we've got what look to be
devices that you smoke pot in.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.322
To turn this around, we'll make
some Texas-sized transformations.

00:31.948 --> 00:33.825
-How much does it weigh?
-A thousand pounds.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.493
And teach this headstrong owner...

00:35.577 --> 00:38.121
I'm worried about
what you guys are gonna do.

00:38.204 --> 00:39.122
You should be.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.458
...how to succeed at short-term rental.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.792
Oh, my god!

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:00.935 --> 01:04.480
Right now, we are on
one of the main arteries of Austin.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.899
This is South Congress.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.027
I think the locals call it... SoCo.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.947
The style is definitely
separate from the rest of Texas,

01:13.031 --> 01:14.491
a culture unto itself.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.494
-You can just feel the vibrance here.
-Yeah.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.830
Austin is just loaded
with incredibly good food,

01:20.914 --> 01:22.582
of course, including barbecue.

01:22.665 --> 01:28.463
Incredible live music scene,
and this giant tech hub as well.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.673
Austin's a top destination

01:30.757 --> 01:33.343
for some of the world's biggest
conventions and festivals.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.054
Things like South by Southwest
and Austin City Limits

01:36.137 --> 01:38.556
make it a huge location
for vacation rentals.

01:38.640 --> 01:43.686
There are lots of hotels being built
right now because the demand is so high.

01:43.770 --> 01:47.607
There are approximately 6,200
vacation rental properties in Austin.

01:47.690 --> 01:52.695
Last year, they brought in about
$250 million in revenue for owners.

02:02.163 --> 02:06.751
South Congress is one of the most
desirable neighborhoods in the city,

02:06.835 --> 02:10.547
and this house is two blocks away,
and it's really exceptional.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.049
Let's talk about the rental
that needs our help.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.760
Bret, our homeowner,
landed a great job in Colorado.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.096
He's back and forth
between Colorado and Austin.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.431
He does have
a property management company.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.600
They're handling the property
while he's away.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.644
This is his property management website.

02:25.186 --> 02:28.231
From the pictures,
it looks cute from the street.

02:28.690 --> 02:33.194
I feel like there's no style
or personality. It's just very disjointed.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.237
There is no design.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.740
He's marketing it as
a two-bedroom, two-bathroom right now.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.160
-Yeah.
-It looks like there's a bedroom

02:40.243 --> 02:43.746
that's being used as an office,
which, for me, is a big no-no.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.416
The last thing I'm going to do
when I'm on vacation

02:46.499 --> 02:49.377
is go sit in someone else's
half-imagined office.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.336
It has a pool.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.714
- A pool's a big deal in Texas.
- Yeah!

02:52.797 --> 02:55.383
He is one of three in the neighborhood.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.427
Three vacation rentals that have a pool.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.928
-That's it.
-That's crazy.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.973
He's not attracting the guests
'cause it's not dialed-in.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.350
He is leaving so much money on the table.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.604
His potential for profit,
I don't think he's even seeing it.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.231
You've got a management company,
so good job there.

03:10.315 --> 03:14.944
But the biggest problem is Bret is not
complying with what they want him to do.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.572
The management company
is considering dropping him.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.365
-Is that's what's happening?
-Yeah!

03:19.449 --> 03:20.658
He's in trouble, huh?

03:20.742 --> 03:24.204
He's going to be really in trouble.
I've invited them to the property,

03:24.829 --> 03:26.998
so we can all meet
and let's hash this out.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.433
-Cute street.
-It's super cute.

03:45.516 --> 03:51.064
And beautiful little picket fence,
and yellow cottage. Definitely inviting.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.441
I don't even mind the yellow,
I quite like it.

03:53.524 --> 03:57.528
I'm happy to see that, on the front
exterior, we don't have to do any work

03:57.612 --> 04:00.907
because we have to do a lot
in the interior and the backyard.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.908
She's pretty.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.077
-Hi, Bret.
-Hey, y'all.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.787
-How you doing?
 -What a cute house!

04:06.329 --> 04:07.747
Thank you, guys, so much.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.457
My name is Bret Caddison.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.835
I live in Steamboat Springs, Colorado,
part of the year,

04:12.919 --> 04:16.505
and I've been dividing my time
between Colorado and Austin.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.882
You're from here, right?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.969
I grew up in Austin. I always wanted
to live in this neighborhood.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.472
I bought it about two years ago,
and I had planned to do a renovation,

04:24.555 --> 04:28.476
but, ultimately, got a job offer
in Colorado that I couldn't pass up.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.229
-Got it.
-So I immediately started renting it out.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.440
I wanted to be completely hands off,
so I hired a property management firm.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.110
What's the problem? Why are we here?

04:37.193 --> 04:41.614
I'm bringing in about $250 a night,
on average, at 60 percent occupancy.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.658
I'd love to make money on this house,

04:43.741 --> 04:46.119
but I'm losing a little bit of money
every month

04:46.202 --> 04:49.747
when you factor in the money I have
to pay the property management company.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.835
My goal is increase the occupancy
to run 80 percent.

04:53.918 --> 04:57.755
It's really a function of, can I double
or triple what I'm getting?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.924
Triple? Easy, tiger.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.136
I like to set ambitious goals.

05:03.219 --> 05:07.098
My property could definitely be designed
to be a lot more appealing.

05:07.181 --> 05:11.352
So you really just need a serious design
and look to market.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.356
I think that's exactly what it needs.
It needs more of a hook.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.276
Guess what? I'm a designer.
Let's go do this.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.489
The truth is,
managing a hospitality business

05:24.032 --> 05:25.700
isn't really in my DNA.

05:25.783 --> 05:29.329
So having Peter and Genevieve's help
will be invaluable to me.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.293
This is kind of the dining area,

05:35.376 --> 05:38.963
which I use occasionally
for small dinner parties and whatnot.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.466
I'm sorry.
I'm barely steps into the place,

05:41.549 --> 05:45.762
and we've got what look to be
like devices that you smoke pot in.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.474
So what if a family is checking in
and the first thing their kids see...

05:49.557 --> 05:51.476
-"What are those, Mommy?"
-Hookah!

05:51.559 --> 05:53.811
I've collected these
from all over the world.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.774
The depersonalization of this home
is something that we have to work on

05:57.857 --> 05:59.817
because this isn't just for you anymore.

05:59.901 --> 06:04.030
Maybe this is more of a game room
or something fun.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.366
I actually have
a tabletop Ms. Pac-Man game

06:06.449 --> 06:09.035
that's about yea high,
like from pizza parlors.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.329
I have it at at a friend's house
'cause I had no room.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.665
Here's the spot! I would die
if that were in a house that I rented.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.250
I challenge you to a game.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.710
-I will kill you.
-All right!

06:17.794 --> 06:21.631
What I'm really loving, visually,
 is this hallway.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.841
-What's in this room?
-That's actually an office.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.220
I also use it for storage
and lock it off when guests are here.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.554
It's a nice size.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.473
So the thing that jumps out to me.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.143
Heads in beds
is how you fluff up the numbers.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.146
You want to make more money,
increase your occupancy,

06:37.230 --> 06:40.525
yet you're sealing off one of the rooms
that can be occupied.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.985
I need a place to do work. I'm here a lot.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.279
When was the last time
you worked in this room?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.368
The sigh says a lot.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.622
Judging by the mouse and the monitor,
it was the '80s you were last in here!

06:56.457 --> 06:58.126
Damn, kitty has claws!

07:00.169 --> 07:01.921
Okay, kitchen time.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.965
All right, the kitchen's been renovated.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.092
-Lots of space.
-Yeah, it works great.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.554
We have glass cabinetry,
which is great for guest rentals 'cause...

07:09.637 --> 07:12.932
You can see everything, you don't need
to go digging through drawers.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.725
-I wouldn't spend the money here.
-Terrific.

07:14.809 --> 07:19.272
This area, though, needs a lot of love.
Take me to your living room lair.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.481
-Sure.
-Okay.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.609
Tell me about your furniture picks
in here.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.863
I have to admit,
I had always wanted a recliner couch

07:26.946 --> 07:30.658
and my ex told me it was too trashy,
and he was absolutely right.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.743
-Can we talk about the arrangement?
-Okay.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.913
So Peter's over there.
I'm going to sit over here. Hey, Peter!

07:36.873 --> 07:38.499
Hey, Gen! Hi!

07:38.583 --> 07:39.959
I can't hear you.

07:40.042 --> 07:44.338
-It's really uncomfortably far away.
-Okay, guys, you've made your point.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.757
This room needs a little bit of work,
I get it.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.968
Biggest project is your backyard.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.928
-Ready?
-Yeah.

07:51.012 --> 07:51.888
Let's go.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.267
Okay. Oh, my gosh!

07:59.145 --> 08:04.025
You have a pool, a hot tub, patio area,
cabana, pool house,

08:04.442 --> 08:06.444
and then this little litter box!

08:06.527 --> 08:11.407
Yes, so... the people before me
bought used Putt-Putt turf.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.368
-Putt-Putt gone wrong, right?
-Yes, an abomination.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.245
Let's look at the real abomination,

08:16.329 --> 08:19.123
this huge exposed pipe situation.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.625
This is all for the pool.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.378
We'll cover this so we don't have to
look at it full-time but can access it.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.589
Just like when you enter the house,

08:26.672 --> 08:30.510
the exit to the backyard
needs to be just as impressive.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.511
Let's talk about this space right here.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.306
A grilling situation would be good.
You gotta represent.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.349
Absolutely.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.726
This is where we chill by the pool.

08:38.808 --> 08:41.687
This is something we see
all over the country.

08:41.770 --> 08:45.775
A really easy way to combat this
is to use furniture covers.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.570
'Cause you're not here, they should be on
the furniture every time a guest leaves.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.530
Okay.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.283
The shade detail is a huge feature
of any backyard.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.160
People overlook it way too often.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.873
This is just dirt. We can clean this off
easily, which saves you a lot of money.

09:00.957 --> 09:06.796
You know, at a hotel, the cabana is always
the most expensive poolside seat.

09:06.879 --> 09:11.384
We want this to feel like that destination
as well. However, it costs you nothing.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.304
Now, let's talk about this pool shed.
What's in here?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.223
TV boxes...

09:17.306 --> 09:18.391
snowmen...

09:18.849 --> 09:21.102
- Snowmen?
- Some killer pumpkins.

09:21.185 --> 09:25.022
this could be your storage, for sure.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.900
You could put a little desk in here
and work in here!

09:27.984 --> 09:30.319
And you're completely private
from the house.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.739
We put money in your pocket by turning
that into a bedroom, which is key.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.910
Bret, I want to know
if I have full permission to use this

09:38.411 --> 09:41.163
-as a big ornament in your backyard.
-Yeah.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.291
Now, we're going to get down to business.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.835
We've brought your property management
company as well.

09:45.918 --> 09:49.255
All be on the same page to make sure
we're doing everything for this property.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.172
Great.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.801
I realized I wasn't going to have time
to focus on the property.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.887
And so I hired
a property management company.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.765
They take care of the maintenance,
handle the guests.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.267
-Hi, guys!
-Hi!

10:01.350 --> 10:04.729
What I like about them is
our economic interests are aligned.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.691
If they see an opportunity
to improve revenue on my property,

10:08.774 --> 10:10.067
they're going to do it.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.696
Our job, here at Turnkey,
is to help homeowners

10:13.779 --> 10:17.700
maximize the potential for income
through their property.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.369
Raul, you know the property well.
What do you,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.456
and your company, recommend
that Bret does immediately?

10:23.539 --> 10:26.334
Couple recommendations
when he first joined our program,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.753
which was to convert the office
to a third bedroom

10:28.836 --> 10:30.421
to increase the occupancy rate.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.507
Turnkey told me to convert my office
into the third bedroom,

10:33.591 --> 10:35.593
which I should have done before I left.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.512
He has this amazing pool area
in the backyard.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.141
But it's not hitting its potential
in terms of the landscaping.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.227
It's Austin. You have to have a barbecue.
It's the center--

10:45.311 --> 10:47.063
It's like sacrilegious, yeah.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.857
Have you made these recommendations
to him?

10:49.940 --> 10:53.069
We're not a decorating firm per se,
we don't do construction.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.530
We can give him tips about what to have,
but Bret's a busy guy.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.366
What happens if one of your owners

10:58.449 --> 11:01.535
just disregards all the recommendations
you're making

11:01.619 --> 11:03.412
and the house doesn't change?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.623
In relationships, you say
"It's you, not me."

11:07.458 --> 11:08.793
Consciously uncouple.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.588
So, on your listing, your photographer
did a really good job.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.341
When I scroll down,
I find the description...

11:16.008 --> 11:17.802
is good but not great.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.639
I think there's a couple of points
we could work on as a team

11:21.722 --> 11:23.808
to get you a banging description.

11:23.891 --> 11:28.562
We'll welcome Bret's input on the local
features of this home that we could add.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.608
So, on the numbers, your monthly nut
on this is approximately how much?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.861
$4,500, which includes mortgage
and most of the expenses.

11:35.945 --> 11:39.740
And you're getting, on average,
throughout the year, how much a night?

11:39.824 --> 11:41.450
I would say about $250.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.786
- And at 60 percent occupancy.
- Yeah.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.747
Okay, that actually works out
to 4,500 bucks.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.875
But how much do you guys take?

11:49.959 --> 11:53.170
Our fee is 18 percent of the rent
generated on the property.

11:53.254 --> 11:57.216
Nearly 900 bucks getting removed
from that 4,500.

11:57.299 --> 12:02.304
We are way below market. So you're
generating approximately $55,000 a year.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.017
If we got your rate up to $420 a night,
which the redesign will do,

12:07.101 --> 12:10.146
and increase the occupancy
from 60 to 80 percent,

12:10.229 --> 12:13.149
you get to almost $121,000.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.026
So, more than double
what you're making now.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.904
Yeah, that would be a start.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.114
-That works?
-Yeah.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.700
I love Austin, actually.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.619
It's important to me
that people that stay in my home

12:25.703 --> 12:28.164
have a good experience here.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.665
Boom! There you go!

12:29.749 --> 12:32.626
And I feel like,
if I'm able to deliver that experience,

12:33.085 --> 12:34.837
that's going to show me the money.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.896
This homeowner wants
to optimize his vacation rental.

12:51.979 --> 12:55.900
To do that, he must get involved in
all areas of the business transformation.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.487
First, Genevieve will reimagine the design
of the house,

12:59.570 --> 13:01.405
especially the backyard pool area.

13:01.489 --> 13:05.910
We'll add an artistic social media moment
for his guests to promote their stay.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.414
Finally we'll meet with his property
manager to improve the website listing.

13:22.593 --> 13:26.639
The biggest tool we have to help Bret
make more money with his property

13:26.722 --> 13:27.765
is design.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.309
We need to make this prettier
from the inside out

13:30.392 --> 13:32.686
so it stands out
against the competition.

13:32.770 --> 13:36.941
In order to do that, we're turning this
former dining room into a game room

13:37.024 --> 13:40.986
so, the first impression guests have
coming in, is that they're on vacation.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.613
That is worth money.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.324
And we're turning this office
into a bedroom.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.284
With two more people able to sleep here,

13:47.368 --> 13:51.747
we're increasing what Bret can charge
per night by 20 to 30 percent.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.958
Just like any great hotel,

13:54.041 --> 13:56.836
you need to really deliver
in the common areas.

13:57.878 --> 14:02.091
But we're funneling the majority
of our budget into the backyard space.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.636
We're going to make it
the ultimate barbecue pool lounge.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.181
We need to get everything
in the boxes. Let's take this one up.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.267
So, what do you think? I mean, look!

14:12.309 --> 14:16.063
It's pretty bare. I'm worried about
what you guys are gonna do to this place.

14:16.146 --> 14:16.981
You should be.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.650
I didn't realize
I was gonna be kicked away from my house.

14:19.733 --> 14:24.572
My biggest fear is Genevieve is gonna add
a little too much estrogen to this place.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.740
See you later. Bye!

14:38.836 --> 14:39.795
So cute.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.548
The furniture in Bret's house
has got to go.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.174
It's very comfortable.

14:44.258 --> 14:47.094
We're going to a local Austin
furniture store to find pieces

14:47.177 --> 14:49.263
that are going to appease
as many guests as possible.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.348
It's no longer just about Bret.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.767
Let's look at this bed!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.144
Let's talk about it.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.983
I detest metal frame beds
with every fiber of my being.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.401
Okay, tell us why.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.236
I like a mixture of wood.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.322
I really don't like just...

15:06.614 --> 15:08.741
-Metal.
-Thin metal frames, yeah.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.786
Remember, you are not sleeping
in this bed. That is for your guests.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.999
The bed that we have to choose for this
space needs to have a small footprint.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.959
Because the room is small, remember?

15:19.043 --> 15:20.961
I will not... I will keep that in mind.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.546
I want a bed that has a wood frame.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.174
You're not hearing it go...

15:25.257 --> 15:28.218
The challenge is
that room doesn't have a lot of space.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.178
I'm not sure

15:29.261 --> 15:32.181
if I'm going to find
what I want to accommodate that.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.557
Incredible couch.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.560
- I'm not a huge fan. It's too deep.
- Sit on it.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.062
-Yeah.
-It's a sucker.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.689
I love it,
but maybe not for a guest rental.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.817
-This color, for guest rental, is tough.
-It'd be destroyed.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.402
I wanna try this guy out.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.947
I'm worried,
because it's leather and I have a pool,

15:48.030 --> 15:50.824
people are gonna come in, sit on it,
and it'll get ruined.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.910
Leather is easy to protect and clean.

15:52.993 --> 15:57.247
While we're a little scared of it,
the more it ages, the better it looks.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.584
As long as we have it Scotchgarded,
and we condition it,

16:01.001 --> 16:02.836
once in a while, you're fine.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.590
This sit is an important one
because people spend the most time...

16:06.674 --> 16:08.968
in this room, by your kitchen.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.929
I'm not sure if I love the color.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.348
The brown is just a little bit off.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.391
For you.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.600
For me.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.562
But we're not just thinking about me.
It's not all about me.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.817
I get it. This is about my guests
and what's gonna make them comfortable.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.820
You're making so much progress
in a very short time!

16:27.903 --> 16:29.279
I am putty in your hands.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.844
- You can float it.
- Gen, let me help!

16:51.927 --> 16:53.804
-Let you help what?
-Okay, you're done.

16:53.887 --> 16:57.808
-Ms. Pac-Man, are you kidding me?
-My favorite arcade game of all time.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.602
-Let's turn this sucker on.
-The winner...

17:01.395 --> 17:02.312
You hear that?

17:02.396 --> 17:05.190
-This is an '80s computer booting up.
-Oh yeah!

17:05.273 --> 17:07.483
He happened just to have this!

17:07.568 --> 17:12.614
Then we're going to have a foosball table
right here. Full shelves in back of you.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.702
-I am...
-Yeah!

17:16.785 --> 17:18.704
Freedom!

17:18.787 --> 17:22.374
3630. Nice score.
If you just learned yesterday.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.792
-Where are we going to put this?
-Right here.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.503
-In the middle of the room?
-This is a game room,

17:27.588 --> 17:32.051
and I want everyone to know exactly
what to do the minute they get here.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.512
27... Hang on! Are you on to level two?

17:35.596 --> 17:36.430
Yeah.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.557
It's a fluke.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.602
I love, when people walk in,
there's a game room.

17:41.685 --> 17:44.104
Because Austin, from what I've gathered,

17:44.188 --> 17:47.066
-is all about fun and bars and eating...
-And it's weird.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.025
And it's weird.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.401
Oh, yeah!

17:49.485 --> 17:51.987
You are absolutely kicking my ass.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.197
Yes, I am.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.994
You know, I'm getting called. Bye!
See you later, Gen! I've got to work!

17:59.078 --> 18:02.289
-12,330. No problem.
-It's a fluke! All luck!

18:02.372 --> 18:04.208
Don't need help carrying it, either.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.882
South Congress is an artists' community.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.176
The street is filled
with artwork and murals

18:14.259 --> 18:16.678
that travelers frequently post
on social media.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.473
To help Bret
stick out from his competition,

18:19.556 --> 18:22.226
we're gonna create a social media moment
for his property.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.864
-You're getting color on!
-I'm finally filling in the lines.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.907
Yeah!

18:36.990 --> 18:37.825
So you've got...

18:38.325 --> 18:41.286
-the whole Aztec blanket pattern...
-Yeah.

18:41.370 --> 18:45.541
...mapped out on the pool house
to create, like, this vertical mural.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.586
Once I've finished this star, I'm going
to start at the top and work my way down.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.464
-It's that ultimate backdrop.
-Yeah.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.884
It's gonna set the whole pool area
apart from the competition.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.845
-Definitely.
-Nobody has this.

18:57.928 --> 19:00.055
-It's a mural city, so it kind of works.
-Yeah.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.473
I can't wait to see it!

19:01.557 --> 19:05.018
In order to create a proper
Texas backyard pool oasis,

19:05.102 --> 19:08.689
I'm going to make a dramatic focal point
on the front of the pool house.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.442
I'll create some sort of casbah seating
adjacent to that,

19:12.526 --> 19:15.320
soften the fence in whites and plantings,

19:15.404 --> 19:19.449
I'll bring in lighting, I'll add a full
outdoor kitchen and barbecue situation,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.451
and a full dining feature.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.916
Look how fast this is all happening.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.044
Landscapers and painters
are like zippety-zips in Texas.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.255
We're going to go
from this...

19:34.256 --> 19:36.758
-...kind of poopy brown rock...
-It looks like a potato.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.345
...and we're going to match
this limestone in small gravel.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.307
I'm thinking,
underneath the lip over here,

19:43.390 --> 19:46.685
it would all tuck under
and there'll be plantings in there.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.521
But it'll be one continuous line
of limestone.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.024
I'm sure everything you do
will be five-star.

19:52.107 --> 19:52.941
I hope!

20:05.078 --> 20:06.330
Gentlemen...

20:06.413 --> 20:08.415
The final step
for our business plan

20:08.498 --> 20:13.086
is to get Bret and his property manager
to rethink the information on the listing.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.714
I wanted to kind of just...
jump into the listing,

20:15.797 --> 20:19.051
regarding some suggestions where I think
there's room for improvement.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.012
I wanna talk about the headline.
For me, everything starts with a hook.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.515
Two-bedroom Victorian with private pool.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.309
It isn't grabbing me.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.480
To be honest, I never even looked at that.
And Peter was right. It kind of sucked.

20:31.563 --> 20:35.776
What are the most important words
that grab you regarding that property?

20:35.859 --> 20:39.196
First thing that stands out is
the location, and then the pool.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.449
What's really cool about the location is
it's an oasis.

20:42.532 --> 20:45.285
We've got to hit all the points
in the title, right?

20:45.369 --> 20:47.829
-Yeah.
-I would probably have something like

20:47.913 --> 20:49.915
"Three-bedroom pool oasis...

20:50.374 --> 20:53.001
steps from trendy South Congress
in Austin."

20:53.418 --> 20:55.087
-I like that.
-That sounds great.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.464
Okay, so we've got them now
with the new title.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.508
I want to dig into the photos a little.

20:59.591 --> 21:03.428
The lead picture is the album cover.
Now, your lead picture here...

21:04.054 --> 21:06.473
is the master bedroom
where I can't see the pool.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.851
-Correct.
-So you're saying to me, Mr. Consumer,

21:09.935 --> 21:15.565
the most valuable part of the home
is this half of a double bed

21:15.649 --> 21:18.151
that I can see looking out
onto an umbrella.

21:18.568 --> 21:21.905
I'm not getting sold.
I need that money shot.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.324
I see this with clients all the time.

21:24.408 --> 21:27.619
Property owners with a short-term rental,
who have management, go,

21:27.703 --> 21:29.621
"Here you go, just run with it."

21:29.705 --> 21:32.374
Property management,
for me, is a two-way street,

21:32.457 --> 21:34.543
where you're both extracting...

21:35.168 --> 21:36.795
information from each other.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.674
I clearly have not put in the effort
and the time and attention

21:41.049 --> 21:43.176
to help maximize the revenue on the house.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.762
But I think we're gonna be
in a great position after this.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.055
-Ta-da!
-Yes!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.433
So, good work, team!

21:51.643 --> 21:54.062
One of the biggest aspects
of vacation rentals

21:54.146 --> 21:56.732
is making sure
you provide excellent recommendations

21:56.815 --> 21:58.567
for your guests during their stay.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.696
The guidebook should include the owner's
 favorite restaurants, activities,

22:02.779 --> 22:07.326
and any experiences that can be offered
to help make guests' vacations memorable.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.661
To help build Bret's guidebook,

22:09.745 --> 22:13.290
we've curated a very special
Texas barbecue cooking class.

22:13.373 --> 22:17.127
So, Bret, we have a true,
authentic Texas barbecue experience

22:17.210 --> 22:19.504
we can't wait for you to show your guests.

22:26.803 --> 22:28.930
So, Scott, what is BrisketU?

22:29.306 --> 22:31.725
BrisketU is a pitmaster class.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.395
We go from the A to Z
of cooking a brisket.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.522
We do a lot of private events.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.900
That's great!
So you can go to Bret's house

22:39.983 --> 22:43.862
and you can teach his guests how to...
the correct word is smoke a brisket?

22:43.945 --> 22:46.156
-Yes, sir.
-Brilliant. Brilliant.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.450
In Texas, barbecue is a religion.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.619
And brisket is Jesus.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.913
With the rub,
you're just spreading it around,

22:53.413 --> 22:54.790
-getting it even.
-Oh yeah!

22:55.999 --> 22:58.168
Scott was the epitome of a pitmaster.

22:58.251 --> 23:02.297
You want to stay at 225 to 250
to cook your brisket.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.841
-Hello!
-Ooh, nice.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.885
Oh, my god, you have sausages in there!

23:06.968 --> 23:11.473
It's a really social activity. I think
this could be an amazing guest experience.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.811
That is so good and it's so rich.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.563
It needs no sauce.
That's really good, Scott.

23:19.022 --> 23:23.527
Peter and I are a bit of a matchmaking
couple. We love to create partnerships.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.364
And, I think, since Scott will come over
and teach this class at your house,

23:27.989 --> 23:31.660
we should give you a big smoker
on the back of your deck,

23:31.743 --> 23:34.621
so all your guests
can have this experience privately.

23:34.704 --> 23:35.831
Whenever you're home,

23:36.373 --> 23:39.709
-you can teach all your friends to do it.
-No freaking way!

23:39.793 --> 23:41.169
Thank you, guys!

23:41.253 --> 23:42.462
You're welcome!

23:49.719 --> 23:52.639
-Brilliant. How much does it weigh?
-A thousand pounds.

23:52.722 --> 23:57.727
Chaos in cupboards drives me crazy,
and guess who it drives more crazy?

23:57.811 --> 23:58.728
Guests.

23:58.812 --> 24:02.816
Only the necessary items.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.569
It's the last few hours
of the transformation.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.113
We're doing our final staging
and styling...

24:08.196 --> 24:09.197
Two means you care.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.742
...to make this
the ultimate Texas pool oasis.

24:12.826 --> 24:14.161
I think they're cute.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.165
Wow!

24:18.248 --> 24:19.833
-Beautiful, huh?
-This is nice.

24:19.916 --> 24:23.295
-Gen's killed it again, of course.
-Doesn't that look pretty?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.131
These are really great!

24:26.214 --> 24:27.966
With the house nearing completion,

24:28.049 --> 24:32.053
I've brought in our world-class
photographer to update the listing photos.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.724
So, Cris, for people
who are not professional photographers,

24:35.807 --> 24:37.434
who want to learn a few tips,

24:37.517 --> 24:41.688
can you make any recommendations on
how to get the best results from a room?

24:41.771 --> 24:45.233
First thing you want to do
is let in as much light as possible.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.488
Second tip is get in the corners
and shoot all four corners of the room.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.948
Tuck yourself in nice and tight
and... shoot.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.493
-Not up, down. Straight on.
-Got it.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.287
I can't wait for Bret
to see his vacation rental.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.128
I couldn't sleep last night.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.380
I'm really excited to see my house.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.298
Hey, guys!

25:09.883 --> 25:13.595
You called us in because you needed help
with your vacation rental.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.014
-Yeah!
-You kind of didn't want to lift a finger.

25:16.097 --> 25:18.558
-Yeah.
-But, you know, we've worked on the inside

25:18.642 --> 25:21.144
and we've worked through
the business plan as well.

25:21.228 --> 25:25.023
I think we've reached a point where we can
now launch a successful business.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.983
-I can't wait to see it.
-Ready to see all of it?

25:27.067 --> 25:29.361
-I'm really ready.
-We've transformed your house.

25:29.444 --> 25:31.947
I know it's going to be girlier
than it was before.

25:32.447 --> 25:34.574
It isn't hard. You had a pleather couch.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.036
-Ready?
-This is so exciting.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.749
Oh, my god!

25:43.750 --> 25:45.585
This is amazing!

25:46.586 --> 25:48.338
Love the foosball table.

25:48.421 --> 25:52.300
The Ms. Pac-Man from my youth!
I can't believe this!

25:52.384 --> 25:54.302
Do you remember what was here before?

25:55.011 --> 25:57.472
I feel like this room
is perfect for entertaining.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.224
I love the boots.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.518
Oh, my god, the horns!

26:02.143 --> 26:03.353
The horns!

26:05.564 --> 26:07.440
I feel Texan!

26:08.233 --> 26:11.236
And another thing that's really beneficial
for your guests,

26:11.736 --> 26:13.071
is adding another bedroom.

26:13.655 --> 26:16.074
Okay, now, this I've got to see.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.160
Oh, Genevieve!

26:19.619 --> 26:20.453
Wow!

26:20.954 --> 26:22.372
This is great!

26:22.455 --> 26:24.457
What was once your office

26:24.874 --> 26:26.293
is now a proper bedroom

26:28.128 --> 26:31.131
- This is the perfect amount of girly.
- You're okay with it?

26:31.214 --> 26:32.882
I think this works beautifully.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.301
It feels nurturing.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.304
My house may be a boy,
but this is a mom!

26:38.305 --> 26:41.099
Even though this is a tight space,
full-length mirror.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.811
A, it makes the room feel bigger,
and, B, we all need it on the road.

26:44.894 --> 26:47.355
On the business aspect,
you can sleep more people.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.482
I can't see why
we can't increase the rate.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.734
This is awesome!

26:51.151 --> 26:52.402
Oh, my god!

26:54.029 --> 26:55.071
Oh, my god!

26:55.530 --> 26:57.449
Yeah, this is really cool!

26:58.742 --> 27:00.744
Oh, god, I love the couch.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.830
I was so skeptical about this color,
Genevieve.

27:04.497 --> 27:08.960
And I love it! I love the coffee tables.
The chairs, they're so handsome!

27:09.044 --> 27:12.964
So we had your little pleather love seat,
a hand-me-down Mom chair.

27:13.048 --> 27:17.344
Now we have seating
for ten people. It's inviting, it's warm.

27:17.427 --> 27:19.429
Two groups of people can be hanging out.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.766
I thought of it as a TV room,
perfectly laid out, for me.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.518
I had not considered other ways
to use the space.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.146
I feel like
I have a little slice of heaven.

27:28.229 --> 27:32.567
That's what I want everyone who comes here
to feel. Ready for the backyard?

27:32.901 --> 27:34.110
-I am.
-Let's go!

27:35.111 --> 27:36.738
No way!

27:41.326 --> 27:43.536
So cool! Oh, my god!

27:43.870 --> 27:46.456
- Really helps, from Astroturf.
- Yeah.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.291
The deck is amazing.

27:49.417 --> 27:53.588
The first thing I want to do
in Texas is be outside, eating barbecue.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.715
You have an outdoor dining area now.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.884
-I don't know what to say.
-Keep going.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.597
Oh, my god!

28:03.098 --> 28:04.974
That's crazy!

28:08.353 --> 28:10.438
That is an amazing design.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.400
You're the coolest one on the block, Bret.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.653
Your pool shed is... bomb.

28:16.736 --> 28:20.407
Yeah, I love it so much. I always like
to think about the competition.

28:20.490 --> 28:24.077
There are two other vacation rentals
in the SoCo area that have a pool,

28:24.160 --> 28:27.247
but now that you offer... this experience,

28:27.330 --> 28:30.375
people are gonna go,
"Yeah, I get more with this guy. Click."

28:31.000 --> 28:33.294
I'm going to crush my competition.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.713
Can we go back in time?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.382
This was terrifying to me.

28:37.465 --> 28:41.386
This area was sloping, everything was
rotting out, the carpet was rotted.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.140
You've gained a whole gang-load
of experiences now.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.808
This looks so amazing!

28:47.475 --> 28:49.811
- It looks brand new!
- This is totally an oasis!

28:50.478 --> 28:54.566
This is really going to give guests
a much more amazing experience

28:54.649 --> 28:56.651
than they were getting before.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.654
This is what they'll remember
as a big part of Austin.

29:00.155 --> 29:04.993
I think this pool shed
is a wonderful backdrop for photos.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.287
Well, it is the perfect backdrop now.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.582
You have your social media
marketing moment.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.167
So let's do your profile pic.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.502
- It's so cute!
- Are you ready?

29:15.503 --> 29:16.963
-There you go!
-Awesome!

29:17.046 --> 29:21.468
I think it's gonna be an indelible image
that people have once they stay here.

29:23.511 --> 29:26.097
Peter and Genevieve are going
to make me a lot more money.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.599
Wow!

29:27.682 --> 29:31.853
My favorite part is definitely
the backyard. It's all beautifully done.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.938
And it comes together as a work of art.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.815
-What?
-Hi, Raul.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.525
-Hi!
-Hey!

29:37.609 --> 29:39.736
-It's a serious barbecue.
-Bret!

29:41.237 --> 29:43.156
-I know! Score!
-This is...

29:43.239 --> 29:44.866
Oh, my god! What?

29:45.658 --> 29:46.493
Look at that!

29:46.951 --> 29:47.786
Wow!

29:47.869 --> 29:52.332
Have we now delivered,
to both of you, the best pool house

29:52.415 --> 29:54.876
that is a vacation rental in SoCo?

29:55.293 --> 29:58.755
Hands down this is one
of the best properties with a pool.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.007
It's beautiful. It's phenomenal.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.259
-You make my job a lot easier.
-I love that.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.221
I want you to make a promise to each other

30:06.304 --> 30:08.348
to communicate on all levels from now on.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.266
-Deal.
-Give me a hug.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.768
All right! Good!

30:11.851 --> 30:14.896
We need to go live
and launch the new property listing.

30:17.190 --> 30:21.277
Walkable to the beating heart
of the famed South Congress area

30:21.361 --> 30:23.655
lives the Austin SoCo PoolHouse.

30:24.197 --> 30:28.284
Three bedrooms and two bathrooms,
with a game room and updated furniture,

30:28.368 --> 30:32.497
makes this home perfect for festivalgoers
and travelers looking for the local vibe.

30:33.289 --> 30:37.085
The crescendo to the story
is the outdoor entertainment pool area,

30:37.168 --> 30:41.381
complete with luxury cabana,
an unforgettable artist's mural,

30:41.464 --> 30:46.135
and an authentic smoker
for a true Texas barbecue experience.
