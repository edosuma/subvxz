00:22.146 --> 00:24.565
As Hurricane Flozell grows stronger,

00:24.690 --> 00:27.605
record surf threatens to breach
the Langley Falls Sea Wall

00:27.730 --> 00:29.601
and flood all of Lower Langley.

00:29.726 --> 00:31.657
Residents are urged to evacuate.

00:31.823 --> 00:33.575
Thanks, Greg.
Stay safe out there.

00:33.741 --> 00:35.015
Ahahahah, don't worry.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.662
I've been in some nasty storms.

00:39.580 --> 00:40.415
Oh my God.

00:41.017 --> 00:42.370
The sky ate Greg.

00:42.899 --> 00:46.399
How can you calmly do housework
when there's a hurricane outside?

00:46.524 --> 00:48.212
I'm stuck inside all day anyway,

00:48.337 --> 00:50.722
Might as well scratch some 
things off my to-do list.

00:51.164 --> 00:52.266
Install this light fixture,

00:52.391 --> 00:54.789
prepare the table,
find my old college javelin.

00:54.914 --> 00:57.099
Why on Earth would you ever need that?

00:57.815 --> 00:59.315
You'll never know.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.463
Well, this weather is worrying me.

01:03.588 --> 01:05.355
Are you sure we shouldn't evacuate?

01:05.522 --> 01:06.523
Evacuate?

01:06.608 --> 01:08.042
I'm not going to abandon my house

01:08.109 --> 01:10.010
just so a bunch of guys
in sports jerseys

01:10.078 --> 01:11.945
can loot the place and do
God-knows-what with...

01:12.013 --> 01:14.682
my old college javelin.

01:14.749 --> 01:16.410
(thunder crashes)

01:16.576 --> 01:18.652
But we're in Lower Langley.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.788
<i>And</i> we're in the lowest part
of the neighborhood!

01:20.855 --> 01:23.834
That's why so many soccer balls
end up in our yard.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.493
(wind howling)

01:26.544 --> 01:27.629
(Greg screams)

01:27.795 --> 01:29.330
We'll be fine.

01:29.397 --> 01:31.632
I've got us totally prepared
to ride out the storm.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.969
But what if the sea wall breaks?
Greg said that...

01:34.202 --> 01:36.270
Francine, a man's most important duty

01:36.338 --> 01:37.504
is to protect his family.

01:37.572 --> 01:39.440
So, please, just trust me.

01:39.507 --> 01:41.601
I won't let anything
happen to you guys. Okay?

01:41.767 --> 01:43.193
Mm, okay...

01:43.261 --> 01:44.662
Try to relax.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.764
Watching all that news is
just making you paranoid.

01:46.848 --> 01:48.832
Maybe a nice massage
will calm you down.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.986
Just start up here.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.486
Check it out!

01:52.553 --> 01:54.888
I got full blueprints
of our house for my project.

01:54.939 --> 01:57.074
The Junior Architect Society

01:57.158 --> 01:58.676
isn't going to know what hit them!

01:58.743 --> 02:02.112
Are you allergic to vaginas, Steve?

02:05.066 --> 02:06.752
Jeff, what if the sea wall breaks?

02:06.918 --> 02:08.619
The zoo is in Lower Langley.

02:08.703 --> 02:10.422
Wh-What about the animals?

02:10.588 --> 02:12.089
Uh, don't worry, babe.

02:12.173 --> 02:14.241
All the animals will
take care of each other,

02:14.292 --> 02:16.427
just like they do in the wild.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.379
I don't know what I'd do without you.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.713
You're my rock.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.215
Come on.
Let's go get high

02:21.266 --> 02:22.934
and talk about
other times we got high.

02:25.737 --> 02:27.371
Last night was magical.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.306
I think we could
really have something.

02:29.374 --> 02:31.675
Oh, yeah, yeah...

02:31.743 --> 02:34.244
Yeah, say, could I get
that sweatshirt back from you?

02:34.312 --> 02:35.813
It looks pretty nasty out there.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.448
Maybe I could just wear it

02:37.515 --> 02:39.201
and give it back to you next time?

02:39.367 --> 02:40.801
Yeah... it's just,

02:40.869 --> 02:43.747
it's kinda my favorite,
you know, from college.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.272
I'll wash it for you.

02:45.323 --> 02:47.241
I just want to wear it for a while.

02:47.308 --> 02:50.577
(deep sniff, sighs)

02:50.645 --> 02:51.945
It smells like us.

02:52.013 --> 02:53.298
(groans)

02:53.464 --> 02:56.301
(wind rushing)

02:56.468 --> 02:59.269
If you've seen this man, please
call the station right away.

02:59.337 --> 03:02.740
He was last seen being sucked
into the sky, where he belongs.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.726
(voice cracking):
Because he's an angel!

03:04.892 --> 03:06.477
(doorbell rings)

03:09.030 --> 03:11.515
- Hey, Buckle.
- Stan, you're still here?!

03:11.583 --> 03:14.184
Everyone in the
neighborhood has evacuated.

03:14.269 --> 03:16.970
Even my friends Julius and
Rachel Epstein left.

03:17.021 --> 03:18.740
They're beavers, Stan!

03:18.906 --> 03:21.701
I appreciate the concern,
Buckle, but we'll be fine.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.727
The roads aren't passable anymore,

03:23.795 --> 03:26.039
but I've got an amphibious vehicle!

03:26.205 --> 03:29.550
I'm going to get Shari, and
we'll stop by on our way out.

03:29.617 --> 03:32.753
I pray you come with us, my friend.

03:32.821 --> 03:33.937
(kisses)

03:36.590 --> 03:39.710
Stan, are you sure
we shouldn't go with them?

03:39.778 --> 03:41.596
The sea wall could break any minute.

03:41.762 --> 03:43.781
For the last time, we'll be fine.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.032
We have weeks of supplies,

03:45.100 --> 03:46.350
and the house is
completely watertight.

03:46.418 --> 03:47.936
How do you know that?

03:48.102 --> 03:49.937
Remember when everyone
was worried about anthrax

03:50.004 --> 03:51.638
and dirty bombs a few years ago,

03:51.706 --> 03:54.258
even though they should be far,
far more worried about it now...

03:54.325 --> 03:56.486
- trust me I know what I'm talking about?
- I remember.

03:56.652 --> 03:58.595
Well, I everything-proofed the house.

03:58.663 --> 04:01.283
It's sealed against anthrax,
radiation, water...

04:01.449 --> 04:03.767
This dumb bastard's going
to get us all killed!

04:03.835 --> 04:05.161
We have to evacuate!

04:05.327 --> 04:06.920
We are staying right here!

04:06.988 --> 04:10.090
"Not I," said the guy
who lived, and was beautiful.

04:10.158 --> 04:12.059
I'm going with
Red Beard Raccoon Coat.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.660
Anyone who's interested in living

04:13.728 --> 04:15.362
and not being stupid and crazy,

04:15.430 --> 04:16.764
I suggest you join me.

04:16.831 --> 04:18.531
And anyone who trusts <i>my</i> judgment

04:18.600 --> 04:19.867
as the protector of this family,

04:19.934 --> 04:21.351
I suggest you join <i>me!</i>

04:24.305 --> 04:25.682
Francine?!

04:25.848 --> 04:27.408
I'm sorry, Stan.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.844
But when there's a crisis,
you make bad decisions.

04:30.912 --> 04:32.946
They sound reasonable in the moment,

04:33.014 --> 04:34.214
but they...

04:34.282 --> 04:37.110
always...
end badly.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.194
That's ridiculous!

04:38.360 --> 04:40.154
I know it's hard to hear, Stan,

04:40.255 --> 04:41.255
but it's true.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.140
Come on, kids.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.951
I'm with Mommy!
Betrayal!

04:45.117 --> 04:47.027
I have to stay, Mom.

04:47.095 --> 04:48.695
If the zoo floods, I need to be here,

04:48.763 --> 04:50.297
so I can start rescuing animals.

04:50.365 --> 04:53.016
Besides, I-I think the house
will probably hold.

04:53.101 --> 04:54.468
I'm with you, babe.

04:54.536 --> 04:56.370
See what a good wife
Jeff is, Francine?

04:56.438 --> 04:58.048
He sticks by <i>her</i> husband.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.307
I'll stay with you, Roger.

05:00.408 --> 05:02.693
You're still here?

05:05.596 --> 05:07.265
Come on, you guys!

05:07.431 --> 05:10.317
How can you trust that guy
over me, your own husband?!

05:10.368 --> 05:12.302
You're not giving me any choice!

05:12.370 --> 05:14.922
Staying here is a perfect example

05:14.989 --> 05:17.651
of you making a bad crisis decision.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.094
I still don't understand why we
couldn't have taken the Solara!

05:21.162 --> 05:25.033
The Solara is not amphibious,
my sweet Semitic treasure!

05:25.199 --> 05:27.634
Francine, staying here
is not a bad decision.

05:27.685 --> 05:28.619
I've prepared for this...

05:28.686 --> 05:30.971
I finally did it.

05:31.022 --> 05:32.022
I've made my decision

05:32.106 --> 05:33.690
about whether to stay or go.

05:33.775 --> 05:35.559
It took a lot of soul searching,

05:35.643 --> 05:36.643
but in the end...

05:36.694 --> 05:37.545
ALL OTHERS:
Shut up, Klaus!

05:37.711 --> 05:39.172
Punt!
(Klaus screams)

05:39.338 --> 05:41.424
Hayley, please come with us.

05:41.590 --> 05:42.549
I can't, Mom.

05:42.617 --> 05:45.762
(dramatically):
What of... the animals?

05:45.928 --> 05:47.404
Why, why, why, why

05:47.472 --> 05:49.656
do you have to say it like that?
(deep rumbling)

05:49.707 --> 05:50.908
No...!

05:50.992 --> 05:53.076
The sea wall has broken!

05:57.022 --> 05:58.499
(all scream)

05:58.550 --> 06:00.443
(panting)

06:00.609 --> 06:02.970
What an exciting first date!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.239
We're not dating, you miserable cow!

06:05.306 --> 06:07.274
(laughs)
You're funny!

06:07.342 --> 06:08.609
Oh... my God.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.938
Buckle and Shari!

06:14.006 --> 06:15.506
They're dead.

06:15.574 --> 06:16.841
Nothing we can do now but pray

06:16.909 --> 06:19.045
and strip all the copper piping
out of their house.

06:19.211 --> 06:22.096
If you'd gotten in that vehicle,
you'd be dead, too, Francine.

06:22.147 --> 06:24.448
If we'd left this
morning, like I wanted,

06:24.533 --> 06:26.534
we'd be safe at Mah Mah
and Bah Bah's right now!

06:26.601 --> 06:27.595
We're safe here!

06:27.761 --> 06:29.203
The generator's working.

06:29.271 --> 06:31.839
The place is sealed tighter than
an unlubricated Komzel valve.

06:31.907 --> 06:33.975
Or maybe the more obvious joke:

06:34.042 --> 06:37.044
a Zwanzi tribesman's nook-nook
ribbon, pre-Lonzi ritual.

06:37.112 --> 06:38.815
(loud bump,
house jerks slightly)

06:38.981 --> 06:41.599
Um, Dad...
You didn't seal the drainage

06:41.667 --> 06:44.118
that allows water to pass
under the house, did you?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.586
'Cause without that, the water'll put

06:45.654 --> 06:46.614
too much pressure on the structure...

06:46.780 --> 06:48.172
Steve, stop it.
Just because

06:48.256 --> 06:49.724
you're in an architect club
doesn't mean...

06:49.791 --> 06:52.176
Hiya, Barb!
Some weather, huh?

06:52.260 --> 06:53.728
...doesn't mean you know
everything about...

06:53.795 --> 06:54.831
Hey, Principal Lewis!

06:54.997 --> 06:57.932
End of days... bitches...!

06:57.983 --> 07:00.045
(laughs raucously)

07:00.211 --> 07:02.903
...about this house...

07:02.971 --> 07:05.508
We're moving. The house
is moving. I see that now.

07:05.674 --> 07:06.907
(wind whistling)

07:09.011 --> 07:10.728
Just as I suspected!

07:10.796 --> 07:12.446
The water couldn't
pass under the house,

07:12.514 --> 07:14.315
so it pushed it off the foundation!

07:14.383 --> 07:15.583
See, Stan?

07:15.651 --> 07:17.918
Sealing up the house and staying here

07:17.986 --> 07:20.982
sounded like okay decisions,
but look what happened!

07:21.148 --> 07:23.474
I feel so close to you.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.243
Let's go look at your baby pictures.

07:26.311 --> 07:28.179
Great, you go get them.
They're outside.

07:28.246 --> 07:31.015
Where?
Just... outside.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.994
Anywhere. Just go find
them. It's a game.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.652
I say we go up to the attic...

07:34.720 --> 07:36.454
the highest, safest part
of the house.

07:36.521 --> 07:38.205
We should stay down here.

07:38.273 --> 07:40.875
If rescue comes, we can climb
right out the window

07:40.942 --> 07:42.076
and onto the boat.

07:42.144 --> 07:43.444
You know what?
Fine.

07:43.512 --> 07:46.447
Anyone smart or loyal enough
to take my side in this,

07:46.515 --> 07:47.615
come with me to the attic.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.514
Hayley, don't listen to him!

07:52.680 --> 07:53.971
She's made up her mind, Francine.

07:54.039 --> 07:56.440
Just like how I normally
make up your mind.

07:57.726 --> 07:58.959
(thunderclap)

08:01.230 --> 08:02.997
Penny for your thoughts?

08:03.048 --> 08:04.315
I don't have any change.

08:04.383 --> 08:05.966
Saucy.
Shut up.

08:06.034 --> 08:07.685
Do not pass go.
What?

08:07.753 --> 08:10.004
Chicken butt.
I hate you.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.239
Got your nose!
(groans)

08:15.494 --> 08:17.455
Stan, what are you doing?

08:17.621 --> 08:19.379
I'm dropping an anchor to stop us.

08:19.431 --> 08:21.000
We could crash into something
and sink!

08:21.166 --> 08:23.234
Oh, please don't do that!

08:23.318 --> 08:25.970
I know an anchor sounds like
a good plan.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.040
I can't poke any holes in it, per se.

08:29.107 --> 08:32.226
But based on your history...
(Stan grunts)

08:32.277 --> 08:34.061
My wine fridge!

08:34.129 --> 08:35.780
I had my cocaine in there!

08:37.365 --> 08:39.450
(deep creaking sound)

08:39.534 --> 08:41.534
See, Francine!

08:41.586 --> 08:43.438
It <i>was</i> a good idea, and it worked!

08:43.605 --> 08:45.942
Thanks to me,
the Smith family is safe!

08:46.108 --> 08:49.076
(house creaking)

08:52.281 --> 08:53.783
(All scream)

08:53.949 --> 08:55.082
(All scream)

08:59.771 --> 09:01.749
(Francine and Roger groan)

09:01.915 --> 09:04.127
I'll never forget you, Roger!

09:04.293 --> 09:05.259
Just ignore her.

09:06.695 --> 09:08.179
No...!

09:08.246 --> 09:10.383
My sweatshirt!

09:10.549 --> 09:12.666
(Jeff cries)

09:12.734 --> 09:13.767
Don't worry.
I can fix this.

09:17.438 --> 09:18.823
It's jammed!

09:18.890 --> 09:21.269
Ha! Tables have turned, bitches!

09:21.435 --> 09:23.227
This whole house is going to flood.

09:23.295 --> 09:25.729
Tough luck for you dicks
who don't have gills.

09:25.797 --> 09:27.598
I guess it's my house now,

09:27.666 --> 09:30.450
and I can go wherever I want!

09:30.502 --> 09:31.836
(laughs hysterically)

09:31.903 --> 09:34.621
See you never, goat-(bleep)!

09:36.224 --> 09:38.458
(screams)
This is salt water!

09:38.510 --> 09:39.760
It burns!

09:39.811 --> 09:42.373
(gasping)
Put me back, put me back!

09:42.539 --> 09:44.315
(panting)

09:44.399 --> 09:45.833
Whew!

09:45.901 --> 09:49.453
(laughs sheepishly):
So...

09:49.521 --> 09:54.302
a lot of funny jokes
happened just now, <i>ja?</i>

09:54.468 --> 09:56.243
We're completely upside down!

09:56.311 --> 09:58.245
Aw, look Steve.

09:58.313 --> 10:00.642
Our glow-in-the-dark
star stickers are still here.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.000
Remember that night we camped
out in the living room?

10:03.068 --> 10:05.769
We told ghost stories and you
had your first big-boy dream?

10:05.837 --> 10:07.188
Such volume!

10:07.255 --> 10:08.539
(faint pounding from below)

10:08.623 --> 10:10.207
That must be the others,
in the attic!

10:10.275 --> 10:11.408
We have to help them!

10:11.476 --> 10:13.154
Hmm. Looks like we can use

10:13.320 --> 10:15.312
this vertical access
aft to get down there.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.231
Those are the stairs, Steve.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.266
We need to make some kind of rope...

10:19.334 --> 10:20.601
maybe out of curtains.

10:20.669 --> 10:21.902
As if!

10:21.970 --> 10:23.671
You think I'm gonna risk
my neck for Stan,

10:23.738 --> 10:24.805
after what he did to my wine fridge?!

10:24.873 --> 10:25.667
No way!

10:25.999 --> 10:28.442
But... what about your wigs?

10:28.510 --> 10:29.671
They're all in the attic.

10:29.911 --> 10:32.446
(gasps)
Get out of my way! I'll kill you!

10:32.513 --> 10:33.914
(crashes)

10:33.982 --> 10:35.382
(debris clattering)

10:35.450 --> 10:37.918
ROGER (in pain):
Franny... we need to make...

10:37.986 --> 10:39.353
some kind of rope

10:39.421 --> 10:40.754
perhaps...

10:40.822 --> 10:42.392
out of curtains.

10:42.624 --> 10:44.158
(creaking)
I couldn't get the window shut!

10:44.209 --> 10:45.492
The water is rising!

10:45.544 --> 10:47.355
I'll get us out of this!

10:47.521 --> 10:49.747
(crying)

10:49.831 --> 10:51.999
I'm... not gonna make it, babe!

10:52.050 --> 10:54.919
I-I want you to take my Hacky Sack...

10:55.003 --> 10:58.088
and-and give it to our grandchildren.

10:58.173 --> 10:59.423
Jeff, we don't even have kids.

10:59.507 --> 11:00.891
I know.

11:00.976 --> 11:02.726
That's why...
I want you to...

11:02.811 --> 11:04.478
take this folded-up candy wrapper.

11:04.545 --> 11:06.347
Don't ask me how I did it.

11:06.398 --> 11:09.585
Just take it and start our family.

11:09.751 --> 11:11.952
It looks like this corridor
should take us

11:12.020 --> 11:13.954
directly to the main attic access.

11:14.022 --> 11:16.523
It's not a corridor, it's a hallway!

11:16.591 --> 11:18.859
You need to stop with
the architect jargon.

11:18.927 --> 11:20.594
Seriously.
Look at me.

11:20.662 --> 11:24.225
You need to zip it, lock it
and put it in your pocket.

11:24.391 --> 11:25.733
FRANCINE:
Stan?!

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
It's Mom!

11:26.868 --> 11:28.135
She's gonna save us!

11:28.203 --> 11:29.303
We don't need saving.

11:29.371 --> 11:30.788
I've got this under control.

11:30.872 --> 11:33.057
I'm here, Francine!
Don't panic!

11:33.124 --> 11:34.541
I'll get us through this!

11:34.609 --> 11:35.960
FRANCINE:
What?

11:36.027 --> 11:38.829
Stan, we're moving
the stuff off the door!

11:38.897 --> 11:40.114
Just hang on!

11:40.215 --> 11:42.049
That's real good, honey!
Keep your spirits up!

11:42.100 --> 11:43.884
I'm coming!

11:45.887 --> 11:47.638
There, there, you're safe now.

11:51.610 --> 11:53.004
The wigs!
They're all gone!

11:53.170 --> 11:56.799
Half of those belonged
to Brendan Fraser!

11:56.965 --> 11:59.149
Oh, thank the stars you made it!

11:59.217 --> 12:00.303
Come here, I've got you!

12:00.469 --> 12:01.804
Oh, bless you, Roger!

12:01.970 --> 12:03.604
KLAUS:
I was afraid I...

12:03.672 --> 12:05.606
Thank God this one survived.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.810
I can still go to cowboy weddings.

12:07.976 --> 12:09.660
<i>Nein!</i>

12:12.481 --> 12:14.298
Okay, one at a time.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.917
The rope isn't very strong.

12:16.985 --> 12:18.569
I don't want to die here!

12:18.637 --> 12:20.888
I'm supposed to die
in the medical tent

12:20.956 --> 12:22.006
at a music festival!

12:22.090 --> 12:23.618
(Jeff screaming)

12:23.784 --> 12:25.059
Jeff, no!

12:25.126 --> 12:26.460
Ow!

12:26.528 --> 12:27.955
Jeff! Now we lost our rope!

12:28.121 --> 12:31.015
(sobbing):
I'm so sorry!

12:31.099 --> 12:32.900
Get ahold of yourself!

12:36.504 --> 12:38.339
Huh.

12:40.041 --> 12:41.241
Huh.

12:42.377 --> 12:44.044
How are we gonna get up there now?

12:44.112 --> 12:45.746
Get us out of here, Mrs. S!

12:45.830 --> 12:47.100
No!
I'll save us!

12:47.266 --> 12:48.549
We, uh... we should...

12:48.616 --> 12:50.985
open a window and flood this floor!

12:51.052 --> 12:53.398
The rising water will carry us
right up to the living room.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.818
There's no way we're doing
another one of your ideas, Stan!

12:59.486 --> 13:01.239
HAYLEY:
Maybe we should.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.663
What?

13:02.731 --> 13:04.531
Look, I know Dad's decisions
haven't worked out,

13:04.599 --> 13:06.567
but he is trying.

13:06.634 --> 13:07.735
I say we open the window...

13:09.246 --> 13:12.039
unless anyone has a better idea...

13:12.107 --> 13:14.108
based in reality.

13:14.175 --> 13:15.920
Okay, then.
Window it is.

13:16.086 --> 13:16.921
Thank you, Hayley.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.145
You're welcome, Dad.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.678
(Hayley screams)

13:23.844 --> 13:25.369
Ahh!

13:25.453 --> 13:28.355
(trailing off):
Dad was wrong...

13:28.406 --> 13:31.158
Wow, what a beautiful creature.

13:31.242 --> 13:32.960
And we know so little about them.

13:37.858 --> 13:38.691
Hayley!
Hayley!

13:38.742 --> 13:40.153
Oh, God! Oh, God!

13:40.319 --> 13:41.994
That shark's in here, man!

13:42.062 --> 13:44.664
If they're really attracted
to blood, then it's in my room,

13:44.731 --> 13:48.367
attacking the boxers I wore
the day Francine made tacos.

13:48.418 --> 13:49.919
Just leave me behind!

13:50.003 --> 13:51.664
I am bad in a crisis.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.238
And it got Hayley killed!

13:53.290 --> 13:54.707
Don't give up, Dad.

13:54.758 --> 13:56.711
We got the window closed
and we'll find her.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.545
(muffled groaning)

13:59.596 --> 14:02.048
It's the ghost of Hayley risen
up from the depths of hell!

14:02.099 --> 14:04.050
She has unfinished business with me!

14:04.101 --> 14:05.417
Leave me be, specter!

14:05.469 --> 14:07.386
No, she's alive!

14:07.437 --> 14:09.223
Why would you assume
she went to hell?

14:09.806 --> 14:12.185
Hayley?!

14:12.409 --> 14:15.511
What's on the bottom
of your mattress, Steve?

14:15.579 --> 14:18.581
So many of the girls
are Asian, and pregnant.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.316
She's not in here,
we should keep moving.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.154
Shark!

14:25.238 --> 14:26.389
Oh, thank god.
It's just a dead girl.

14:26.456 --> 14:27.623
Ah!

14:27.691 --> 14:30.275
Roger, you came back for me.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.787
Uh, okay.

14:31.953 --> 14:36.250
Do you want to come to dinner
at my parents' house on Tuesday?

14:36.416 --> 14:38.669
What did you find?!
I-Is it Hayley?!

14:38.835 --> 14:40.713
No, it's nothing.
Just a cushion.

14:40.879 --> 14:44.890
We're going to have lots of babies.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.595
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.579
She's not in here, either.

14:50.647 --> 14:51.931
Where's your father?

14:51.999 --> 14:53.518
The shark got him!

14:53.684 --> 14:55.434
Stan! Hayley!

14:55.502 --> 14:57.939
I don't see any...

14:58.105 --> 14:58.940
(groaning):
Oh!

14:59.106 --> 14:59.857
Hayley!

15:00.023 --> 15:01.657
Careful!

15:01.725 --> 15:05.127
The shark let me go when I
jammed my one-hitter in its eye,

15:05.195 --> 15:06.812
but I think it's
still here somewhere.

15:08.000 --> 15:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:16.498 --> 15:17.757
Hang on, Hayley.

15:17.824 --> 15:18.874
Mama's coming.

15:24.330 --> 15:27.099
(whispering):
Does anyone have Chap Stick?

15:28.505 --> 15:30.039
I got you, honey.

15:30.107 --> 15:31.222
It's okay...

15:31.388 --> 15:33.140
(screaming)

15:33.306 --> 15:34.827
Go, go, go!

15:37.060 --> 15:39.061
(thudding)

15:40.313 --> 15:41.564
We have to go up!

15:42.649 --> 15:43.516
Oh!

15:47.320 --> 15:48.698
(shark growling)

15:48.864 --> 15:49.972
(sighs)
(creaking)

15:50.040 --> 15:51.140
We did it!

15:51.208 --> 15:53.259
We got away.

15:53.326 --> 15:55.411
Okay, according to the blueprints...

15:55.495 --> 15:56.946
(yelling)

15:57.013 --> 15:59.582
It's hungry for flesh <i>and</i> knowledge!

15:59.666 --> 16:01.877
(screaming)

16:02.043 --> 16:03.769
(crying)

16:03.837 --> 16:05.087
Don't look at me, whore!

16:05.172 --> 16:07.206
We both know what this is!

16:07.257 --> 16:08.491
It's love!

16:08.558 --> 16:11.010
Forever love!

16:11.061 --> 16:12.978
(crying)

16:14.431 --> 16:15.564
Stan! Oh.

16:15.649 --> 16:18.017
(laughs sheepishly):
Didn't see you there.

16:18.068 --> 16:21.937
Sneaky. A sneaky boy is what you are.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.523
Francine was right about me, Klaus.

16:24.574 --> 16:27.693
The farther away from the family
I am, the safer they'll be.

16:27.744 --> 16:29.211
HAYLEY: There he is! There he is!

16:29.279 --> 16:30.579
STEVE:
Look at all his teeth!

16:30.664 --> 16:31.947
They don't sound very safe, Stan.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.232
You'd better get in there!

16:33.283 --> 16:35.734
I want to, but I'll only
make things worse

16:35.786 --> 16:37.330
- with my bad decisions.
FRANCINE: - Aah, look!

16:37.496 --> 16:40.206
Look, Stan, everyone
makes bad decisions,

16:40.257 --> 16:42.174
but it's a numbers game.

16:42.242 --> 16:44.962
Eventually, you're bound
to make the right call.

16:45.128 --> 16:46.005
(Hayley screaming in distance)
I am?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.246
Sure.
(blows landing nearby)

16:47.297 --> 16:48.514
Look at Nicolas Cage.

16:48.581 --> 16:50.582
He made many horrible movies.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.802
<i>Snake Eyes, Eight Millimeter,</i>

16:52.886 --> 16:54.386
<i>Gone in Sixty Seconds,</i>

16:54.438 --> 16:55.855
<i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin,</i>
<i>Windtalkers...</i>

16:55.922 --> 16:57.422
(blows landing, indistinct shouting)

16:57.524 --> 16:58.891
<i>...Ghost Rider, Family Man,</i>

16:58.942 --> 17:01.227
<i>Weather Man, Wicker Man,</i>
<i>Bangkok Dangerous.</i>

17:01.278 --> 17:02.862
(Francine screaming)

17:02.929 --> 17:06.531
But then he nailed it, Stan,
with <i>National Treasure Two,</i>

17:06.598 --> 17:08.819
the greatest movie of all time!

17:08.984 --> 17:11.237
(distant screaming)
He did nail it!

17:11.288 --> 17:14.707
He nailed it so hard that he
<i>became</i> a national treasure...

17:14.773 --> 17:16.125
too.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.242
STEVE:
Mom, behind you!

17:17.294 --> 17:18.377
(Francine screams)
My God!

17:18.444 --> 17:19.795
(blows landing, screaming)

17:19.880 --> 17:22.381
If Nicolas Cage can recover
from his bad decisions

17:22.448 --> 17:24.666
and make a great one, so can I!

17:24.751 --> 17:25.711
That's the spirit.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.220
I'm going to save my family!

17:28.547 --> 17:30.675
(monkey hooting,
lion roaring)

17:30.966 --> 17:33.844
And this time, I'm going
to make the right call.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.345
I don't want to die yet.

17:36.429 --> 17:38.180
I haven't experienced
the disappointment

17:38.265 --> 17:40.516
of being in a monogamous
sexual relationship.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.934
(whimpers)

17:41.985 --> 17:43.135
STAN:
Help has arrived!

17:43.186 --> 17:44.730
(growling)

17:44.971 --> 17:46.482
(all screaming)
STAN: It's okay.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.651
I let the bear in to kill the shark.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.487
They're natural enemies
since the dawn of time.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.413
(growls)

17:54.480 --> 17:56.742
(growling)

17:56.908 --> 17:58.334
They're working in tandem!

17:58.401 --> 17:59.702
They're brothers in arms!

17:59.769 --> 18:00.871
(grunts)

18:01.037 --> 18:02.540
(growling)

18:02.706 --> 18:04.290
Just a hiccup. Don't worry.

18:04.357 --> 18:05.835
I'm Nic Caging this mother!

18:06.001 --> 18:07.503
(metallic clanging)

18:07.669 --> 18:08.660
(hissing)

18:08.712 --> 18:11.180
This time, I'll make the right call.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.008
I'm gonna electrocute them!

18:13.174 --> 18:14.817
Oh, Stan, I don't think...

18:16.011 --> 18:17.553
Aah!

18:17.637 --> 18:19.889
(whimpering)

18:22.726 --> 18:25.227
(wood creaking)

18:28.681 --> 18:30.232
Don't worry. I'm on this.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.351
Next time, I'm bound
to make the right call.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.353
You're killing us, Mr. S!

18:34.404 --> 18:35.988
Stop it!
Stay calm, Jeff!

18:36.039 --> 18:37.156
I'll get us through this.

18:37.207 --> 18:38.274
You have to let...
(groans)

18:38.341 --> 18:39.775
me... (punching)
(groans)

18:39.843 --> 18:41.043
help... you...
(groans)

18:41.127 --> 18:42.962
FRANCINE: - Stan!
- I know, honey.

18:43.029 --> 18:44.081
You believe in me again.

18:44.247 --> 18:45.781
No!

18:45.849 --> 18:47.752
You're making everything
much, much worse!

18:47.918 --> 18:49.652
Now look me in the eyes.

18:49.719 --> 18:53.155
I'm going to tell you
exactly what to do.

18:53.223 --> 18:55.885
You need to go out and get help.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.554
No more decisions or ideas.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.224
Go outside and get help, okay?!

19:02.390 --> 19:03.548
Okay, I hear you.

19:03.650 --> 19:05.050
I really do.

19:05.101 --> 19:06.852
But I'm not going to do that.

19:06.903 --> 19:08.487
Because I have a better idea.

19:08.554 --> 19:11.942
My old college javelin.

19:12.108 --> 19:14.820
Remember?

19:14.986 --> 19:16.395
I'll harpoon the bear,

19:16.463 --> 19:19.116
and the bear blood will distract
the shark, and we can escape!

19:19.282 --> 19:21.076
Stan!

19:21.242 --> 19:22.995
(wind whipping)

19:23.161 --> 19:24.470
No!

19:28.833 --> 19:30.442
No!

19:34.347 --> 19:35.580
(tranquilizer gun fires)

19:35.632 --> 19:36.632
(tranquilizer gun fires)

19:36.716 --> 19:37.967
(tranquilizer gun fires)

19:38.084 --> 19:39.845
Ow!

19:41.187 --> 19:43.005
(birds singing)

19:45.058 --> 19:46.775
(groaning)

19:48.233 --> 19:50.212
Sorry about tranquilizing you, Stan.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.048
I-I wasn't sure who was doing
the most damage down there.

19:53.116 --> 19:54.450
It's okay.

19:54.517 --> 19:56.251
You did the right thing, Buckle.

19:56.319 --> 19:59.114
You harpooned me.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.824
I told you to go out and get help...

20:01.891 --> 20:04.026
and you harpooned me.

20:04.094 --> 20:05.995
I'm so sorry, Francine.

20:06.062 --> 20:08.964
I just wanted to prove
I'm good in a crisis.

20:09.032 --> 20:11.066
I failed.

20:11.134 --> 20:15.771
Stan, 99% of the time,
there is no crisis,

20:15.839 --> 20:19.041
and you're a wonderful
husband and father.

20:19.109 --> 20:21.043
But what about when there is one?

20:21.111 --> 20:23.329
It's the man's job
to protect his family.

20:23.396 --> 20:25.297
And you <i>can, honey...</i>

20:25.365 --> 20:28.352
by getting the hell out
of the way and doing nothing.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.647
Huh. Do nothing.

20:31.813 --> 20:36.151
Francine, we both know
I'm not going to do that.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.677
I wonder how much damage
the hurricane did

20:38.745 --> 20:39.738
to the neighborhood.

20:45.452 --> 20:46.769
Oh, what a day.

20:46.836 --> 20:47.997
CLEVELAND:
Tell me about it.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.040
I don't even know
where the hell I am.

20:50.206 --> 20:52.585
Looter!
Self defense!

20:52.834 --> 20:54.877
A black and a white talking
as if it's normal!

20:56.588 --> 20:58.047
Peter, what are you doing?

20:58.114 --> 20:59.381
You know me!

20:59.449 --> 21:00.999
Everybody shut up and let me think!

21:01.067 --> 21:02.317
Just let me think!

21:02.385 --> 21:03.535
Stan, have you...?
(fires gun)

21:03.603 --> 21:05.070
(crying)

21:05.138 --> 21:09.594
(laughs)
Oh, man. Classic <i>American Dad.</i>
