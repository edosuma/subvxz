WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.371
Here we are digging in
the Money Pit.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.073
Nothing like this has been done
since 1801.

00:08.074 --> 00:10.309
- Wait until we hit something.
- You better believe it.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.578
The treasure of Tumbes is
the biggest

00:12.580 --> 00:14.313
missing treasure of gold.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.081
I think it's on Oak Island.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.416
This could be the year, Dan.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.384
We're poised on the vault.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.152
How prophetic is that?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.554
We're feet away
from what we've labored for,

00:22.556 --> 00:23.555
for eight years.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.157
Come on baby.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.458
Wood.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.660
Wood! Well, I'll be damned.

00:31.665 --> 00:35.234
<i>There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:35.236 --> 00:38.337
<i>where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:41.540
<i>for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:45.310
<i>So far, they have found bits
of gold chain,</i>

00:45.312 --> 00:49.415
<i>a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:53.085
<i>even a 17th century
Spanish coin.</i>

00:53.087 --> 00:57.756
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

00:57.758 --> 01:00.359
And, according to legend,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.595
one more will have to die

01:03.597 --> 01:06.298
before the treasure
can be found.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.150
All right, slammin' can.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.287
Oscillate, baby.

01:28.289 --> 01:32.458
<i>For brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,</i>

01:32.460 --> 01:36.462
<i>what began as a dream
more than fifty years ago,</i>

01:36.464 --> 01:39.465
<i>has finally become a reality.</i>

01:39.467 --> 01:41.733
<i>They and their partners
are digging</i>

01:41.735 --> 01:43.735
<i>in the Oak Island Money Pit.</i>

01:45.406 --> 01:47.206
Andrew! Making hole!

01:47.208 --> 01:49.475
Hey guys. Yes, making hole.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.743
- I love that.
- Sinking casing.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.580
You know, when we first
started doing this,

01:54.582 --> 01:56.515
I'm thinking "man, this is
painfully slow."

01:56.517 --> 01:58.217
But you know what? It's not.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.886
It's almost 20 feet
buried there. Already 15.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.655
Yeah, so we're probably 2 hours
into it and we're down 15 feet.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.291
13 feet inside.
So things are going well.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.128
<i>With the help of a device known</i>

02:10.131 --> 02:12.431
<i>as a casing oscillator,</i>

02:12.433 --> 02:14.867
<i>the first of several
five-foot wide,</i>

02:14.869 --> 02:18.237
<i>30,000 pound steel caissons
is driven</i>

02:18.239 --> 02:20.672
<i>down into the ground.</i>

02:20.674 --> 02:23.542
<i>It is a method strikingly
similar</i>

02:23.544 --> 02:27.446
<i>to the one Dan Blankenship
employed 45 years ago</i>

02:27.448 --> 02:29.915
<i>when he dug borehole 10-X</i>

02:29.917 --> 02:33.919
<i>by using old railway tank
cars welded end-to-end.</i>

02:35.256 --> 02:37.289
<i>And, just like 10-X,</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:39.825
<i>the Valley 3 borehole
will be both wide</i>

02:39.827 --> 02:42.261
<i>and safe enough for a diver,</i>

02:42.263 --> 02:45.731
<i>should one be required when
the team reaches their target:</i>

02:45.733 --> 02:47.633
<i>The Chappell Vault.</i>

02:47.635 --> 02:51.770
<i>In 1897, treasure hunters,</i>

02:51.772 --> 02:54.506
<i>William Chappell
and Frederick Blair</i>

02:54.508 --> 02:56.508
<i>located what they believed to be</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:59.244
<i>a seven-foot-tall wooden box.</i>

02:59.246 --> 03:01.947
<i>It was covered in a type
of concrete,</i>

03:01.949 --> 03:05.717
<i>and located approximately
143 feet deep</i>

03:05.719 --> 03:08.921
<i>beneath the surface
of the Money Pit.</i>

03:08.923 --> 03:11.857
<i>What made their find
even more astonishing</i>

03:11.859 --> 03:15.928
<i>was that their coring bit
also pulled up bits of gold,</i>

03:15.930 --> 03:18.430
<i>along with a small
piece of paper,</i>

03:18.432 --> 03:22.301
<i>on which was written
the letters, "V.I."</i>

03:22.303 --> 03:26.238
Definitely got wood.
See what else we might have.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.341
<i>It was this same wooden vault
that Rick and Craig</i>

03:29.343 --> 03:31.977
<i>believed they located
two years ago.</i>

03:31.979 --> 03:35.614
Concrete and then wood.
That's the description.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.884
<i>That discovery,</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:41.687
<i>coupled with several weeks
of painstaking research,</i>

03:41.689 --> 03:44.456
<i>have suggested to
the Oak Island team</i>

03:44.458 --> 03:46.692
<i>that this is the best location</i>

03:46.694 --> 03:49.461
<i>for their first
major excavation.</i>

03:52.233 --> 03:53.532
We're going to go pick up
the next extension,

03:53.534 --> 03:55.334
24 feet long,

03:55.336 --> 03:57.603
put it in place, bolt it on,
16 bolts,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.938
and we're sinking can,
driving can.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.807
Driving can, sinking can,
making hole.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.644
You know what?

04:05.646 --> 04:07.546
We made substantial
progress here.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.748
And it's basically historic.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.017
Nothing like this has been done,
in my opinion,

04:12.019 --> 04:13.919
since the original Money Pit.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.521
Because everybody else
was guessing.

04:16.523 --> 04:18.523
We know exactly what
we're heading for.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.360
I mean, even Chappell and
Hedden, they were guessing.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.295
So this is the first time

04:23.297 --> 04:25.764
someone has actually
drilled with a target,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.367
I'd say, since 1801 or so.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.435
- Yep.
- It is historic.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.571
Here we are digging
in the Money Pit.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.307
- Finally.
- Yeah, finally!

04:35.309 --> 04:37.643
- Wait until we hit something.
- You better believe it.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.578
As Kent says, keep slamming can.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.416
<i>It's pretty exciting!</i>

04:44.418 --> 04:45.617
<i>You know, nothing's
falling apart.</i>

04:45.619 --> 04:47.386
<i>We seem to be on target.</i>

04:47.388 --> 04:50.455
Something is actually all coming
together on Oak Island.

04:50.457 --> 04:54.359
<i>As the 24-foot long
steel caisson</i>

04:54.361 --> 04:58.363
<i>grinds slowly into the ground,
an 8-ton digging tool</i>

04:58.365 --> 05:01.900
<i>known as a "hammer grab"
excavates the earth.</i>

05:01.902 --> 05:04.936
<i>Each extraction,
also known as "spoils,"</i>

05:04.938 --> 05:07.739
<i>is then loaded onto a truck</i>

05:07.741 --> 05:11.943
<i>and transported
some 1000 yards away</i>

05:11.945 --> 05:15.714
<i>near the middle of the island
on Lot 25.</i>

05:18.619 --> 05:21.386
<i>First, the spoils are unloaded.</i>

05:21.388 --> 05:22.988
Hey Jack, why don't you
grab the back hoe,

05:22.990 --> 05:24.589
and let's spread
these spoils out.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.692
<i>Then, Jack Begley,</i>

05:26.694 --> 05:28.894
<i>and island historian
Charles Barkhouse,</i>

05:28.896 --> 05:32.731
<i>will carefully examine them
for artifacts or bits of debris</i>

05:32.733 --> 05:35.534
<i>that could provide
important evidence.</i>

05:35.536 --> 05:37.836
Down more, there you go,
now just back up.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.340
That's better. Perfect.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.708
As we dig in the Money Pit,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.476
we have to look at what we
are digging up.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.745
Do you want to pick out
any wood that you see?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.714
I'll go over and take a look,
before you go over there.

05:48.716 --> 05:53.585
<i>So we need to keep
those spoils separate,</i>

05:53.587 --> 05:55.087
and we will make sure we
analyze them.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.023
Guess what!

05:58.025 --> 05:59.891
- What?
- Another dowel hole!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.893
I'm coming out.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.095
- What?
- I got one

06:03.097 --> 06:04.663
with a dowel in it, right here.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.099
- Are you serious? Wow.
- See?

06:07.101 --> 06:08.867
There's the dowel right in it.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.535
Wow. Great.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.104
I mean, we gotta do
some research,

06:12.106 --> 06:14.005
see if we can find how
these shafts were constructed,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.041
and maybe we'll know
where these came from.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.510
That's why it's important to
save all this stuff.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.779
<i>Although the team's first target</i>

06:20.781 --> 06:23.648
<i>in the Money Pit, the
mysterious, "Chappell Vault,"</i>

06:23.650 --> 06:27.619
<i>is approximately
140 feet deep underground,</i>

06:27.621 --> 06:29.454
<i>there is no telling
what a search</i>

06:29.456 --> 06:31.656
<i>of the spoils might turn up.</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:34.059
We're finding a lot of wood
from other tunnels,

06:34.061 --> 06:35.460
from other shafts.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.462
It's a possibility it could be

06:37.464 --> 06:39.698
what we call
"the Dunfield spoils."

06:39.700 --> 06:42.968
<i>When Robert Dunfield undertook</i>

06:42.970 --> 06:47.439
<i>a massive excavation
of the site in 1965,</i>

06:47.441 --> 06:50.976
<i>the spoils were never
properly examined.</i>

06:50.978 --> 06:55.647
<i>Although much of the excavated
material was later used to fill</i>

06:55.649 --> 06:58.817
<i>the 135-foot deep hole back in,</i>

06:58.819 --> 07:01.720
<i>valuable evidence
and possible treasure</i>

07:01.722 --> 07:05.590
<i>was lost or destroyed.</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:06.858
You want to get
you metal detector,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.760
start going over this stuff?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.796
There's a possibility that there

07:10.798 --> 07:12.898
could be something in
those spoils,

07:12.900 --> 07:15.967
and the fact that area's
gonna change dramatically,

07:15.969 --> 07:18.203
we have a perfect opportunity
today,

07:18.205 --> 07:20.772
to go through it
and hopefully find something.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.909
Anything, Jack?

07:23.911 --> 07:25.977
Maybe.

07:25.979 --> 07:30.882
<i>Using the Minelab CTX
3030 hand-held metal detector,</i>

07:30.884 --> 07:34.553
<i>Jack Begley begins scouring
the area for evidence.</i>

07:45.833 --> 07:47.466
Look at that.

07:47.468 --> 07:48.948
Wow, that's way above the
line, there.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.643
What do ya' got, Jack?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.111
Is it a nail?

08:00.113 --> 08:02.714
There it is.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.055
It's a bullet!

08:10.057 --> 08:12.524
You know what? You're right.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.227
It's a shell casing.

08:15.229 --> 08:18.964
<i>A shell casing? From a bullet?</i>

08:18.966 --> 08:21.166
<i>Could this have been left behind</i>

08:21.168 --> 08:25.036
<i>by someone hunting on
the island decades ago?</i>

08:25.038 --> 08:28.106
<i>And, if so, what was the prey?</i>

08:28.108 --> 08:32.510
<i>Was it animal... or human?</i>

08:32.513 --> 08:35.580
And we know it came from
down in the Money Pit area.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.082
- Yeah.
- All right.

08:37.083 --> 08:38.917
I'm going to see
if there's anything else.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.266
That sounds different, Jack.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.234
Yeah, we got something.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.571
Yeah.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.546
This is very curious.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.080
What ya' got, Jack?

09:09.082 --> 09:11.116
Take a look at that.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.186
I got a really weird
hit off this.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.923
When you say "weird," you mean
weird good or just weird?

09:17.925 --> 09:21.726
Well, it started off
looking like silver.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.328
It could be.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.730
<i>A silver object?</i>

09:25.732 --> 09:28.934
<i>Found in the spoils
of the Money Pit excavation?</i>

09:28.936 --> 09:30.802
I mean, look at how
perfectly round it is.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.238
<i>Could Jack Begley
and Charles Barkhouse</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:36.074
<i>have just found
an important clue?</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:39.210
<i>Something previously
overlooked by Robert Dunfield?</i>

09:39.212 --> 09:40.645
It looks really weird to me,
though.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.113
It does look weird.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.915
<i>Or could they be
looking at something</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:45.817
<i>even more significant?</i>

09:45.819 --> 09:50.121
<i>Perhaps even a small piece
of the treasure itself?</i>

09:50.123 --> 09:52.657
I have no idea what that is.

09:52.659 --> 09:54.626
It's very curious,
no question about that.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.128
- It's very dense.
- Yeah.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.063
Whatever it is, it's very heavy.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.731
Wow, it is.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.633
Okay, Jack, I'm going to put
this in a bag.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.835
Alright, we're almost done with
this first pile, Charles.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.837
Yeah, I know.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.740
<i>Like all of the
artifacts found on the island,</i>

10:08.742 --> 10:11.910
<i>the metal object Jack
discovered must be cleaned,</i>

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
<i>photographed, weighed,</i>

10:13.981 --> 10:17.215
<i>and analyzed to see
if it has any significance,</i>

10:17.217 --> 10:20.151
<i>either geologically
or historically.</i>

10:20.153 --> 10:22.020
Charles, we're done
with pile one.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.788
- Okay, man.
- Let's move on to pile two.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.124
Sounds like a plan. Let's do it.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.934
<i>Coming up...</i>

10:35.936 --> 10:39.738
<i>momentous operation
at the Money Pit continues...</i>

10:41.341 --> 10:43.975
<i>Rick, Marty and their partners</i>

10:43.977 --> 10:46.678
<i>gather at the nearby
Atlantica resort</i>

10:46.680 --> 10:50.115
<i>and await the arrival
of a special visitor.</i>

10:50.117 --> 10:52.183
So, Randall Sullivan,

10:52.185 --> 10:53.818
I think Charles,
do you know of him?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.720
Yeah, he wrote the article

10:55.722 --> 10:57.188
<i>in Rolling Stone magazine
a number of years ago,</i>

10:57.190 --> 10:58.950
and he's doing a little research
in the area.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.228
<i>In January of 2004,</i>

11:03.230 --> 11:06.431
<i>investigative journalist
and author, Randall Sullivan,</i>

11:06.433 --> 11:09.401
<i>published an article in

11:09.403 --> 11:13.104
<i>entitled "The Curse
of Oak Island."</i>

11:13.106 --> 11:15.440
<i>It featured a detailed history</i>

11:15.442 --> 11:17.776
<i>of the search for treasure
on the island,</i>

11:17.778 --> 11:19.678
<i>as well as compelling interviews</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:21.046
<i>with rival treasure hunters.</i>

11:21.048 --> 11:23.682
<i>Fred Nolan and Dan Blankenship.</i>

11:28.055 --> 11:32.223
<i>Now, more than a decade after
his article's publication,</i>

11:32.225 --> 11:35.894
<i>Randall Sullivan has returned
to Nova Scotia</i>

11:35.896 --> 11:38.697
<i>in hopes of writing
the Oak Island mystery's</i>

11:38.699 --> 11:40.465
<i>final chapter.</i>

11:40.467 --> 11:42.233
Five or six feet per day.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.037
Randall!
Nice to meet you, finally.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.338
- Good to meet you.
- How are you?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.740
This is my brother, Marty.

11:48.742 --> 11:49.974
- Hi, Marty.
- Nice to meet you.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.476
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.182
So, I just, I just want
to say one thing:

11:57.184 --> 11:58.917
I loved that article.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.852
I thought it was absolutely
phenomenal.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.455
- It was well done!
- Well done, very concise.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.023
I have two copies still at home.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.025
Thank you.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.894
Investigative journalist is
the way to describe yourself?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.162
Well, yeah, I'd say my books
either fall into

12:11.164 --> 12:12.897
one of two categories,

12:12.899 --> 12:15.333
investigative journalism,
or literary journalism.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.302
What was the response
to that article?

12:17.304 --> 12:20.405
You know, it was...
it astonished me how many people

12:20.407 --> 12:23.208
didn't know about the story and
were completely entranced by it.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.843
The story just didn't go away

12:24.845 --> 12:26.745
because the mystery's not
gone away.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.413
It's never been solved,
and the feeling that

12:28.415 --> 12:30.915
you walked away
or I walked away from something,

12:30.917 --> 12:32.817
it wasn't done and I wasn't
done with it.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.786
Finally, I had a free moment

12:34.788 --> 12:36.955
and my publisher was finally
ready to say,

12:36.957 --> 12:39.224
"Hey, you should do a book."

12:39.226 --> 12:41.326
Which is why I'm here.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.861
Really, you're writing
a book now?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.496
I am.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.864
Well, I'm not writing it yet.
I'm researching it.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.832
You're researching it!

12:47.834 --> 12:52.804
What do you find is the most
intriguing aspect of the search,

12:52.806 --> 12:54.539
from an informational
point of view?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.775
You know, I completely dismissed

12:56.777 --> 12:58.476
the pirate theory because,
you know,

12:58.478 --> 13:01.913
pirates would dig a hole
maybe 10 feet deep

13:01.915 --> 13:03.548
and come back
when they were ready.

13:03.550 --> 13:07.318
But I didn't know then about
what the pirates did in Tortuga,

13:07.320 --> 13:09.454
where they created a system
of tunnels

13:09.456 --> 13:12.791
that rivals what's
been done on Oak Island.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.893
So there were pirate engineers.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.296
<i>Of the many theories</i>

13:18.298 --> 13:21.132
<i>concerning treasure being
hidden on Oak Island,</i>

13:21.134 --> 13:23.802
<i>perhaps the most popular
and persistent</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:25.804
<i>is that it was most likely
the work</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:28.339
<i>of Spanish
or Portuguese pirates,</i>

13:28.341 --> 13:30.074
<i>who were known to sail
the waters</i>

13:30.076 --> 13:32.310
<i>in and around Nova Scotia during</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:35.380
<i>the 17th and 18th centuries.</i>

13:35.382 --> 13:38.550
<i>But those who doubt
that a sophisticated system</i>

13:38.552 --> 13:41.319
<i>of underground flood tunnels
and booby-traps</i>

13:41.321 --> 13:44.823
<i>could be engineered by rowdy,
rum-soaked buccaneers,</i>

13:44.825 --> 13:47.992
<i>might be in for a surprise.</i>

13:47.994 --> 13:50.061
<i>The popular notion that pirates</i>

13:50.063 --> 13:53.031
<i>were swarthy illiterates
who sported peg legs</i>

13:53.033 --> 13:56.868
<i>and eye patches is largely
a fiction.</i>

13:56.870 --> 14:01.840
<i>Some, like Francis Drake,
were highly respected noblemen.</i>

14:01.842 --> 14:03.842
<i>Others, like Henry Morgan</i>

14:03.844 --> 14:06.377
<i>and Captain Kidd,
were educated seamen</i>

14:06.379 --> 14:08.980
<i>and shrewd businessmen.</i>

14:08.982 --> 14:11.149
<i>Just as sophisticated,</i>

14:11.151 --> 14:13.384
<i>were many members
of their crews,</i>

14:13.386 --> 14:17.322
<i>who often included doctors,
masons, carpenters,</i>

14:17.324 --> 14:20.225
<i>and experts in almost
every profession.</i>

14:21.928 --> 14:24.495
What tags into people
about this mystery?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.599
I think it's 'cause Oak Island's
not just a search for treasure.

14:27.601 --> 14:30.001
It's also a search for meaning.

14:30.003 --> 14:34.939
And nothing engages people
like the search for meaning.

14:34.941 --> 14:38.209
And that's actually what engages
me in terms of writing the book.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.611
I mean, I hope you find
the treasure,

14:39.613 --> 14:43.348
but to me it's the story
and the mystery of it

14:43.350 --> 14:45.416
that is really compelling.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.085
Well, you two share that.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.053
Yeah, my impression is you
feel the same way.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.357
Your story was named
The Curse of Oak Island.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.092
- Yeah.
- Do you believe in the curse?

14:54.094 --> 14:55.927
Well actually,
one of the things that really

14:55.929 --> 14:58.897
struck me deeply
when I was here those years ago,

14:58.899 --> 15:02.267
on Oak Island, it was misty and
foggy and damp the whole time,

15:02.269 --> 15:05.403
but I just...
The place felt haunted.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.039
The reason for, you know,
the Curse is that

15:08.041 --> 15:09.607
so much has been lost there

15:09.609 --> 15:13.278
and when Dan first took me
to the Money Pit area,

15:13.280 --> 15:16.381
the first thing that struck me
was all the wrecked equipment,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.016
'cause back then it was just...

15:18.018 --> 15:19.150
Scattered all over.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.085
All over the place, you know?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.421
And it's sort of almost like
the history of the failures

15:23.423 --> 15:25.356
of these different expeditions,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.959
which in many cases, you know,
devastated lives.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.460
I mean, people couldn't
let it go.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.162
- Yeah.
- I'm hoping that we're gonna

15:31.164 --> 15:34.499
have a, a
mutual assistance league here.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.668
- Of course! Yeah.
- So, I'm picking up

15:36.670 --> 15:40.371
that the Money Pit is the focus
of what you're doing?

15:40.373 --> 15:42.273
- Absolutely.
- Yep.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.208
I mean, we have to...
You can't leave that island

15:44.210 --> 15:46.044
without digging
in the Money Pit.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.414
I understand, I understand.
It's got so much history.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.382
If I was you guys I would wanna
find out what's down there.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.951
It's hard to overlook it.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.252
Yeah, you gotta know
what's down there.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.486
I tell you what, why don't
you come on over

15:55.488 --> 15:57.288
to the island and have
a look around.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.456
You haven't been, yet, right,
not in how many years?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.425
- 13 years.
- All right, it's time.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.060
- It's time.
- You will find the Money Pit

16:02.062 --> 16:04.362
much changed.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.730
- Much changed.
- I'll bet.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.341
This goes up to our big project,

16:16.343 --> 16:18.409
where we built this
big platform.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.544
This is where things are
going to look

16:19.546 --> 16:21.412
a lot different to you.

16:21.414 --> 16:25.083
Here you go, this is it.
I mean, and it's-it's big.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.318
- Let's go have a look.
- Not even close to recognizing...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.287
You know, I'm thinking that
Randall's going to

16:29.289 --> 16:32.423
have a little gasp,
or a little hiccup in his voice,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.359
because it's radically changed.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.300
Man... I mean, it's...

16:45.438 --> 16:47.305
I'm just looking at it,

16:47.307 --> 16:50.041
I mean when Dan brought me
back up here 13 years ago,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.577
this was, you know,

16:52.579 --> 16:54.712
patches of grass.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.049
But you did feel all this
history, you know.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.518
You did feel the layers of all
these things that happened.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.186
Stop now, right?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.655
You're gonna get right
to him if you do that.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.357
That's what I hope.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.792
We have not, quote-un-quote,
"buried history."

17:08.795 --> 17:11.429
Nature will reclaim
that so fast,

17:11.431 --> 17:13.097
and it'll look just the same.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.098
I mean, you have a choice,

17:15.101 --> 17:16.401
you're either going to
preserve a museum,

17:16.403 --> 17:18.703
or, you know, dig.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.204
Enact a search agenda.
Absolutely.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.775
Not to put you in the same
category with Dunfield,

17:23.777 --> 17:26.243
but this is the biggest
excavation,

17:26.246 --> 17:28.579
first major excavation
since him, right?

17:28.581 --> 17:30.314
It is. Absolutely.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.383
This is so much different
than Dunfield.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.519
Dunfield's methodology,

17:34.521 --> 17:38.256
this is surgery
compared to what he did.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.492
Just imagine if the ghosts of
the 19th century could see this.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.494
I mean, it would be...

17:43.496 --> 17:46.164
There is something here.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.765
Call it what you will,
but there's a wonderful

17:47.767 --> 17:50.234
story written beneath our feet.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.136
I want to follow that story,

17:52.138 --> 17:56.474
and hopefully some of what I
learn will be of use to you.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.443
<i>As far as Randall is concerned,</i>

17:58.445 --> 18:00.411
<i>I think it's going
to be helpful.</i>

18:00.413 --> 18:02.647
He comes from an investigative
journalistic background,

18:02.649 --> 18:06.517
and, you know, you set,
you set his nose to something,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.753
and he's going to follow
the trail as far as it goes.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.255
So, that's gonna be very,
very helpful.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.724
<i>Randall Sullivan is
clearly a good writer</i>

18:13.726 --> 18:15.526
and a talented
researcher and if he can

18:15.528 --> 18:17.261
unearth something that's
helpful to us,

18:17.263 --> 18:19.831
we're...
Wide open arms, bring it!

18:19.833 --> 18:21.432
Okay, well here's the deal,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.134
when you write it, make
us look good, okay?

18:23.136 --> 18:26.137
The tough-mind...
The tough-minded Marty,

18:26.139 --> 18:27.371
and the chivalrous Rick.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.609
I think it's going
to lead us somewhere.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.178
I think we're all going to be
very, very surprised.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.747
I'm already very surprised.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.217
The massive amount of
work you've already done,

18:39.219 --> 18:41.652
and the massive amount of work
you're still gonna do;

18:41.654 --> 18:43.654
I sure hope it pays off.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.823
Me, too. I like that thought.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.334
<i>Coming up... ur sledg?</i>

18:56.336 --> 18:58.703
Yeah, I grabbed some rebar,
and some mallets,

18:58.705 --> 19:00.338
and a sledge.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.640
Okay. Let's go see
if it pounds through.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.676
<i>As operations
at the Money Pit site continue,</i>

19:05.678 --> 19:10.214
<i>Rick Lagina, Craig Tester,

19:13.419 --> 19:15.753
<i>where just a few weeks
earlier...</i>

19:15.755 --> 19:17.822
Yeah, think this is it here.

19:17.824 --> 19:21.192
<i>They found what appeared
to be a mysterious hatchway</i>

19:21.194 --> 19:23.261
<i>carved in stone.</i>

19:23.263 --> 19:25.463
Holy smokes.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.599
If this is a hatch,
it would be a way in,

19:28.601 --> 19:31.169
a vertical shaft,
to enter something.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.938
That's very, very odd.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.807
<i>The hatch was located
with the help</i>

19:36.809 --> 19:39.510
<i>of what is reportedly
an ancient map,</i>

19:39.512 --> 19:41.479
<i>which was provided to the team</i>

19:41.481 --> 19:43.814
<i>by New York based writer

19:43.816 --> 19:45.216
<i>Zena Halpern.</i>

19:55.595 --> 19:57.495
<i>It was during this meeting that.</i>

19:57.497 --> 19:59.697
<i>Halpern shared with the team,</i>

19:59.699 --> 20:02.733
<i>not only the map,

connect Oak Island</i>

20:08.575 --> 20:10.942
<i>to the activities
of the Knights Templar,</i>

20:10.944 --> 20:14.245
<i>as far back as the 12th century.</i>

20:16.349 --> 20:19.584
<i>When Jack Begley later
superimposed Zena's map</i>

20:19.586 --> 20:21.285

20:21.287 --> 20:22.620
Look at the top of that.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.689
It follows it perfectly.

20:24.691 --> 20:28.292
<i>The location of the hatch
lined up almost exactly</i>

20:28.294 --> 20:29.961
<i>to a place on the island</i>

20:29.963 --> 20:33.231
<i>where Dave Blankenship had
noticed a deep impression</i>

20:33.233 --> 20:35.266
<i>in the ground near his property.</i>

20:35.268 --> 20:38.836
This hatch lands kind
of where David said...

20:38.838 --> 20:40.338
- The hole is.
- Yeah.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.009
- Well, it's not sunk.
- Yeah, surprisingly.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.746
<i>Ever since Zena's map
surfaced about the hatch,</i>

20:48.748 --> 20:51.682
we need to decide,
does it lead somewhere,

20:51.684 --> 20:53.951
is there really a tunnel
underneath that or not?

20:53.953 --> 20:56.721
Is it a doorway
to an underground complex?

20:56.723 --> 20:58.856
We need to decide that,
yes or no.

returned to see if the hatch</i>

21:11.304 --> 21:16.507
<i>might possibly be a back door
or gateway into the Money Pit.</i>

21:16.509 --> 21:18.576
I'm an old man.
You understand that, right?

21:18.578 --> 21:19.644
Yeah.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.612
You see it slip, you let her go.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.953
- Is it still going down?
- Nope.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.856
Nah, it's kind of stopped
there now.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.692
I'd say he got close
to a foot down

21:34.694 --> 21:37.328
before it really
hit something hard.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.929
If a man dug here,

21:38.931 --> 21:41.032
it would've had to be at least
a couple feet wide,

21:41.034 --> 21:43.501
I mean two or three feet
in length or something,

21:43.503 --> 21:45.403
so let's probe around.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.937
So we got to here, right?

21:46.939 --> 21:48.572
- Somewhere in there?
- Yeah.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.975
Why don't we try a couple
more little holes?

21:55.348 --> 21:57.415
Yeah, there it's
looks like it's stopped.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.456
Same depth. We got to here.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.491
It could be stopping because
it's hitting

22:07.493 --> 22:10.061
a solid piece of slate
like this.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.829
If this fills up with water,

22:11.831 --> 22:13.898
which it should every time
it rains,

22:13.900 --> 22:16.534
it's going to deteriorate
the bottom,

22:16.536 --> 22:18.035
so it's going to be softer
to start off

22:18.037 --> 22:19.737
and then you'll hit
the hard stuff.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.472
You have to have a way down.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.508
You have to have a man-size
opening, and...

22:24.510 --> 22:26.377
- At least!
- It's only going uni...

22:26.379 --> 22:30.047
That depth and no further,
everywhere you've put it so far.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.782
I think we found the bottom.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.018
I mean, I definitely
think this is man-made.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.686
Yep. I do, too.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.459
I mean, you want something
to be something so badly,

22:41.461 --> 22:45.463
i.e., I want it
to be soft material,

22:45.465 --> 22:47.698
and we dig our way down
into something.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.435
But it sunk uniformly
across the bottom

22:51.437 --> 22:53.437
of the so-called hatch.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.374
At that point you have to assume
that it's just bedrock.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.075
Is there a possibility

22:58.077 --> 23:00.544
there was already something
here, and it was dug out?

23:00.546 --> 23:02.513
There is theories,

23:02.515 --> 23:05.416
I mean Fred felt there was
chests all around the island.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.951
Multiple treasure chests that
had been retrieved.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.754
I think he thought there were
eleven sites

23:09.756 --> 23:12.656
where shallow
treasures were recovered.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.026
<i>"Shallow treasures?"</i>

23:16.028 --> 23:18.896
<i>Is it possible
that what the team believed</i>

23:18.898 --> 23:22.032
<i>could be an entrance
into the Money Pit was actually</i>

23:22.034 --> 23:24.802
<i>a hole where treasure was
once buried,</i>

23:24.804 --> 23:28.939
<i>and later filled in after
the treasure was retrieved?</i>

23:28.941 --> 23:31.542
Could it be? Yes.
Do I want to say that?

23:31.544 --> 23:34.745
No, because that's one
less thing we can recover.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.647
But again, it's the "why" of it.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.050
This whole... the whole island is
a one big question mark.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.186
And the biggest question is,
"Why?"

23:42.188 --> 23:45.923
- Yeah.
- Well, we're due answers soon.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.092
<i>Today we surely didn't say,</i>

23:48.094 --> 23:49.727
<i>okay, this isn't worth
exploring,</i>

23:49.729 --> 23:51.695
<i>this isn't worth pursuing.</i>

23:51.697 --> 23:56.634
We surely didn't cross it off
our search agenda, so you know,

23:56.636 --> 23:58.102
again not to use a pun,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.571
but the door on the hatch
is not closed.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.174
- Okay.
- Great attempt, time to move on.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.708
You need to keep
doing your work.

24:04.710 --> 24:06.110
- A-A right.
- Okay.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.079
This island,
I've said it innumerable times,

24:09.081 --> 24:11.115
if this island is
about nothing else,

24:11.117 --> 24:14.919
and it's about many things,
one of which surely is:

24:14.921 --> 24:16.887
This is an island of
possibilities.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.091
Might that be the hatch?
Sure, it might.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.636
<i>Coming up...</i>

24:32.638 --> 24:35.573
<i>and the team from
Irving Equipment Ltd.</i>

24:35.575 --> 24:37.708
<i>Arrives on schedule.</i>

24:39.712 --> 24:43.013
<i>As the giant casing
oscillator continues to grind</i>

24:43.015 --> 24:47.885
<i>the steel caisson
into the rocky ground,</i>

24:47.887 --> 24:51.856
<i>the Oak Island team is now
just a few precious feet away</i>

24:51.858 --> 24:53.824
<i>from reaching their target:</i>

24:53.826 --> 24:58.596
<i>The mysterious wooden structure
that lies 143 feet</i>

24:58.598 --> 25:01.866
<i>beneath the surface
of the Money Pit.</i>

25:01.868 --> 25:05.870
<i>Meanwhile, on the western
side of the island,</i>

25:05.872 --> 25:08.939
<i>author and investigative
journalist, Randall Sullivan,</i>

25:08.941 --> 25:10.841
<i>along with Charles Barkhouse...</i>

25:10.843 --> 25:12.943
After you.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.145
<i>Have arranged a meeting
with veteran treasure hunter,</i>

25:15.147 --> 25:17.648
<i>and local legend,
Dan Blankenship.</i>

25:17.650 --> 25:18.916
- Hey.
- Hi, Dan.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.751
- How are you?
- I'm good.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.119
- It's good to see you.
- Long time no see.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.288
- It has been.
- You look as good as ever.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.824
<i>It is the first time
Randall and Dan</i>

25:26.826 --> 25:28.993
<i>have met since Randall's story</i>

25:28.995 --> 25:32.696
<i>about Oak Island first appeared
in the pages of Rolling Stone</i>

25:32.698 --> 25:34.231
<i>more than ten years ago.</i>

25:34.233 --> 25:36.066
Long time no see.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.935
- 13 years.
- Right.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.803
Lot of water's gone
under the dam,

25:39.805 --> 25:41.071
- that's for sure.
- Yeah.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.606
When I was out here before,

25:42.608 --> 25:43.741
it was just you and me
and your wife.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.910
And now so much has happened

25:45.912 --> 25:48.579
and Rick and Marty have
opened new doors.

25:48.581 --> 25:51.215
I was really
happy to see what Rick

25:51.217 --> 25:53.584
and Marty were doing
in the Money Pit.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.687
Hopefully, this year we'll
maybe get you some conclusions.

25:56.689 --> 25:57.888
Hopefully!

25:57.890 --> 25:59.723
I've been here for a long time.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.559
I'd like to have some positive

26:01.561 --> 26:03.260
- answers one way or the other.
- Well...

26:03.262 --> 26:05.596
- This could be the year, Dan.
- Yes.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.132
What brought you here?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.701
Well, the article wasn't enough.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.270
- I decided I need to do a book.
- Yeah.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.040
- So I've come back to...
- You still in the business?

26:16.042 --> 26:18.909
That's what I do.

26:18.911 --> 26:23.047
Dan, I was always really
dismissive of the pirate theory.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.983
What-what exactly do you mean?

26:25.985 --> 26:28.319
From the coast of Brazil
all the way to Newfoundland,

26:28.321 --> 26:30.154
there were pirates all
along here.

26:30.156 --> 26:33.057
Yeah, they used... they used
the northern hemisphere.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.191
- Yes.
- This part

26:34.193 --> 26:36.160
of the northern hemisphere.

26:36.162 --> 26:40.965
Would any one pirate group have
accumulated enough treasure

26:40.967 --> 26:43.934
to be worth what was
done on Oak Island?

26:43.936 --> 26:47.271
You know, I've always had a hard
time believing that this

26:47.273 --> 26:49.974
amount of work was done
to keep it secret,

26:49.976 --> 26:54.044
unless there was something
really profound and important.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.314
Well, that-that observation
you made is a good one.

26:57.316 --> 27:01.619
How much research have you
really done on the ancient

27:01.621 --> 27:06.123
history of the possibilities of
whatever was done on Oak Island?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.157
A fair bit.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.026
- Have you?
- Yeah.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.961
Well, then you're well aware of,

27:10.963 --> 27:14.999
of Pizarro coming back
from... from Spain

27:15.001 --> 27:17.301
to sack Peru.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.837
And, at that time when he left,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.740
they were eating out of
gold plates in Peru.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.708
- Yeah.
- And when he came back,

27:24.710 --> 27:28.345
even though he left
a Spanish missionary there,

27:28.347 --> 27:30.814
- everything was gone.
- The treasure...

27:30.816 --> 27:33.117
- You aware of that?
- Yeah, I'm very aware of it.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.120
That-that treasure, the treasure
of Tumbes is the biggest

27:36.122 --> 27:38.188
missing treasure of gold.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.225
There's no doubt there was
an enormous fortune in gold.

27:43.329 --> 27:47.965
<i>In 1524, Spanish
explorer Francisco Pizarro led</i>

27:47.967 --> 27:52.036
<i>led an expedition to Peru,</i>

27:52.038 --> 27:55.205
<i>where he encountered the people
of the great Inca Empire</i>

27:55.207 --> 27:57.941
<i>in the ancient city of Tumbes.</i>

27:59.912 --> 28:02.880
<i>Pizarro was astonished
by the Inca's vast amounts</i>

28:02.882 --> 28:05.449
<i>of gold and silver used
to make everything</i>

28:05.451 --> 28:10.120
<i>from dishes to garments
by the native people.</i>

28:10.122 --> 28:14.892
<i>Pizarro returned to Spain
and convinced King Charles V</i>

28:14.894 --> 28:19.963
<i>to allow him more ships and men
to conquer the city of Tumbes</i>

28:19.965 --> 28:23.734
<i>and bring the vast riches
back home to the crown.</i>

28:23.736 --> 28:27.471
<i>However, it has been reported
that when the conquistador</i>

28:27.473 --> 28:31.442
<i>and his fleet returned to the
Inca city several years later,</i>

28:31.444 --> 28:33.844
they found it in ruins,

28:33.846 --> 28:36.013
<i>and the vast treasures of Tumbes</i>

28:36.015 --> 28:39.383
<i>had vanished without a trace.</i>

28:39.385 --> 28:42.786
There's a lot of credence in it,
because according to

28:42.788 --> 28:46.790
what I've read there had to be
a sizeable fortune, you know.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.859
There's a convincing
historical record

28:48.861 --> 28:51.328
that that treasure existed,
because Pizarro

28:51.330 --> 28:54.098
wasn't the only one who saw it,
there were other witnesses.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.733
I mean, I don't think there's
any question

28:55.735 --> 28:59.803
that there was basically
a city of gold in Tumbes.

29:01.373 --> 29:05.075
It is the single greatest
missing treasure,

29:05.077 --> 29:07.144
but it's hard for me
to believe they could

29:07.146 --> 29:10.380
have gotten that from Peru
to Nova Scotia.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.182
Why would it be any harder
to believe that

29:12.184 --> 29:16.887
than to believe whatever
is-is-is out there, you know?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.489
Well, I'm not ruling it out.

29:18.491 --> 29:22.392
It does defy the imagination,
don't misunderstand me.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.228
There's a lot of very
possible theories

29:24.230 --> 29:26.029
of what could be buried here.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.932
I know, you have your theory,
Fred had his theory,

29:28.934 --> 29:30.033
there's a lot of theories
out there.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.902
I have no conclusions, though.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.804
- No, but just a theory.
- There's still theory.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.939
Absolutely.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.342
Dan, grateful for your time,

29:38.344 --> 29:41.178
you know so much,
you are living history.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.214
Always a pleasure, Dan.
Always a pleasure.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.984
- Any time, Charles.
- Okay. You take care.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.452
You, too.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.420
Nice meeting you again.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.303
So where are we?
How close are we to target?

30:06.305 --> 30:09.173
Um, about four feet I think.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.008
From our old ground level,

30:11.010 --> 30:15.212
we are at, 137 with the casing.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.549
<i>If Craig Tester's
calculations are correct,</i>

30:18.551 --> 30:21.318
<i>the Oak Island team is
within minutes</i>

30:21.320 --> 30:24.521
<i>of reaching the place
where two years ago</i>

30:24.523 --> 30:28.959
<i>he and Rick Lagina found what
appeared to be wooden planks</i>

30:28.961 --> 30:31.261
<i>which matched the descriptions
of the so-called,</i>

30:31.263 --> 30:33.597
<i>Chappell Vault, first discovered</i>

30:33.599 --> 30:37.134
<i>more than 100 years ago.</i>

30:37.136 --> 30:39.169
<i>Look, we're very close.</i>

30:39.171 --> 30:42.906
<i>We're feet away
from what we've labored for.</i>

30:42.908 --> 30:45.275
This is as close
as anybody has gotten.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.844
You know, we're on the edge
of our seat.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.071
Didn't get a hell of a lot
that time.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.601
<i>The first sign that we
have reached the vault</i>

31:10.603 --> 31:12.302
<i>should be that we start
bringing up</i>

31:12.304 --> 31:15.138
some significant
quantities of wood.

31:15.140 --> 31:18.075
That's what we expect, um,
that's what we anticipate.

31:20.012 --> 31:23.013
<i>So far, Rick, Marty, Craig,</i>

31:23.015 --> 31:26.416
<i>and the Oak Island team are
justifiably anxious.</i>

31:26.418 --> 31:28.085
We better find some wood.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.387
<i>The Money Pit operation has</i>

31:30.389 --> 31:33.991
<i>cost them more than
$2 million so far,</i>

31:33.993 --> 31:36.159
<i>and the spoils brought
to the surface</i>

31:36.161 --> 31:39.363
<i>by the hammer grab consist
only of soil,</i>

31:39.365 --> 31:43.433
rocks, and other,
natural materials.

31:43.435 --> 31:48.071
So right now, we're 22 inches
with our casing, from vault,

31:48.073 --> 31:50.908
and 14 inches with
our excavation.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.610
14? Okay, you gonna lower
the casing one more time?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.512
We're going down 12 inches now,

31:55.514 --> 31:57.314
so that'll put the two
at the same elevation,

31:57.316 --> 31:59.016
and then we're gonna be roughly
a foot away.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.485
Okay. It's moving pretty
quick through here.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.420
- We'll see.
- Let's let 'em do it.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.491
Now that the massive caisson

32:07.493 --> 32:09.526
<i>has nearly reached what could be</i>

32:09.528 --> 32:11.929
<i>the so-called "Chappell Vault,"</i>

32:11.931 --> 32:14.097
<i>the team from Irving
Equipment Ltd.</i>

32:14.099 --> 32:17.701
<i>Is drilling,
and digging, at a slower rate.</i>

32:17.703 --> 32:21.405
<i>This is done so that potential
damage to the target will,</i>

32:21.407 --> 32:24.007
<i>hopefully, be minimized.</i>

32:24.009 --> 32:28.378
<i>But, if located, what could
the mysterious box contain?</i>

32:28.380 --> 32:30.547
<i>Pirate gold?</i>

32:30.549 --> 32:34.451
<i>Priceless religious artifacts
like the Ark of the Covenant,</i>

32:34.453 --> 32:37.154
<i>or the Holy Grail?</i>

32:37.156 --> 32:39.623
<i>Or could it contain
the lost treasures</i>

32:39.625 --> 32:41.558
<i>of the ancient Incas?</i>

32:43.629 --> 32:46.096
It's the deepest...
Deep as 14 inches.

32:46.098 --> 32:49.199
- Yeah.
- 14 inches away from an answer

32:49.201 --> 32:51.301
or another question,
why didn't we hit it?

32:51.303 --> 32:53.103
Yeah.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.472
<i>As the hammer grab emerges</i>

32:55.474 --> 32:57.474
<i>from the hole with only mud,</i>

32:57.476 --> 33:00.677
<i>the Oak Island team becomes
increasingly concerned.</i>

33:00.679 --> 33:04.247
Come on, bring up a skull
or something.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.249
<i>Could they have miscalculated</i>

33:06.251 --> 33:09.353
<i>the precise location of the
mysterious wooden structure</i>

33:09.355 --> 33:13.023
<i>they located two years ago?</i>

33:13.025 --> 33:14.524
Okay look, here's what I think,

33:14.526 --> 33:16.493
I think this is going perfectly.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.364
I mean, I know we're on pins
and needles because 12 inches

33:20.366 --> 33:22.332
or so we should set
down on wood.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.201
That's what we're hoping, right?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.403
- Yeah.
- It's almost inconceivable

33:26.405 --> 33:28.171
to think that we're not going
to touch wood.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.473
We're going to, Rick!

33:29.475 --> 33:32.509
We're going to,
I have confidence.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.344
You know what, I'm usually
the skeptic,

33:34.346 --> 33:36.113
but we're going
to find something made

33:36.115 --> 33:38.382
of wood at 140 feet,
because we know it's there.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.250
- Yeah!
- And I think that's what's

33:40.252 --> 33:41.685
going to happen, I do.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.220
- I love your attitude.
- I do!

33:43.222 --> 33:45.722
- Yeah.
- There. You feel better?

33:45.724 --> 33:46.790
I don't feel bad.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.293
This is typical Oak Island.

33:50.295 --> 33:52.429
There will be an answer there
or there won't be.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.504
<i>The drill has now
reached its target depth,</i>

34:00.506 --> 34:02.539
<i>but there is still no sign of</i>

34:02.541 --> 34:04.574
<i>the mysterious wooden structure.</i>

34:06.345 --> 34:09.045
How you feeling?

34:09.047 --> 34:13.617
I'd-I'd be willing
to go to one, like, 145.

34:13.619 --> 34:17.187
145, there's nothing there,
then,

34:17.188 --> 34:19.822
then you gotta say you know
what, we misinterpreted,

34:19.824 --> 34:21.358
we mis-calculated.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.826
Yeah.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.161
<i>We believe, we certainly believe</i>

34:24.163 --> 34:25.462
<i>that there's something there.</i>

34:25.464 --> 34:27.464
Now, is it the vault?
I don't know.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.331
I mean, I've been
on this roller coaster,

34:29.333 --> 34:31.601
Oak Island, right, we all have,
for a long time.

34:31.603 --> 34:35.705
But we believe at this point
that we're very close to...

34:35.706 --> 34:38.507
- An answer.
- An answer. Exactly.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.415
See any wood, do you?

34:45.417 --> 34:47.484
- No wood, no wood.
- No wood.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.553
Come on, man, where's my wood?

35:03.135 --> 35:04.668
Just more sludge.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.704
Thinking we should have already
hit the wood?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.474
I can't believe we haven't
hit something yet.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.176
It's okay. It's there.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.186
Come on, baby.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.912
- Wood! Wood!
- We got wood.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.447
I'll be damned.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.648
Look at that.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.391
Yeah!

36:01.393 --> 36:03.426
- Yeah, I think it is.
- I think so.

36:06.532 --> 36:10.300
<i>Has the steel caisson
finally reached its target,</i>

36:10.302 --> 36:13.937
<i>and located the mysterious
wooden structure Rick Lagina</i>

36:13.939 --> 36:17.574
<i>and Craig Tester discovered
two years ago?</i>

36:17.576 --> 36:20.610
When that hammer grab gets
past the casing,

36:20.612 --> 36:23.613
all eyes are on that target.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.183
I think everybody's going,
"My goodness."

36:26.185 --> 36:28.185
Because you can see the wood
coming off of it.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.623
There it is. It's right there.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.194
I'll be damned. Look at that.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.396
- Wood!
- We got wood!

36:39.398 --> 36:41.298
We got wood.

36:41.300 --> 36:44.935
<i>It's within a foot
of where we believed it to be.</i>

36:44.937 --> 36:47.671
Where the historical
record says it should be.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.406
And there's wood.

36:49.408 --> 36:52.876
Okay, so the wood is right
on schedule.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.813
- Did anybody doubt it?
- Never for a minute.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.882
<i>Yes, it's exciting.</i>

36:58.884 --> 37:02.852
<i>But, I want to be absolutely
certain we've hit the vault.</i>

37:02.854 --> 37:04.955
I'm positive at this point
we've hit what we cored,

37:04.957 --> 37:06.723
whatever that is.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.392
We're about to find out
if it's the vault or not.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.994
Okay, let's dig.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.829
Wait, we want to keep digging
now?

37:12.831 --> 37:15.265
Yes! We found it,
let's dig it up.

37:15.267 --> 37:19.469
Now we have to be very careful
at this point.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.837
No we don't. We need that thing
back in the hole.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.806
Rick, it's already been
breached.

37:22.808 --> 37:25.442
We know it's been breached with
drill holes.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.810
Several titis. I know.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.911
We're not going to wreck
anything.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.579
It's been breached.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.451
<i>At this point I'd like
an "all stop" moment,</i>

37:34.453 --> 37:37.354
<i>because I do not want
to blow into this thing.</i>

37:37.356 --> 37:38.922
I believe in my heart of hearts

37:38.924 --> 37:42.459
that it's something
that is very significant

37:42.461 --> 37:44.427
historically and
archeologically.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.330
<i>And I think we need
to take a deep breath,</i>

37:47.332 --> 37:48.865
<i>a long deep breath.</i>

37:48.867 --> 37:50.400
It's all elementary is my point,

37:50.402 --> 37:52.502
I'm not expecting to enter
like a nice,

37:52.504 --> 37:54.871
pristine cave, are you?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.640
- I don't want to be a smart-ass.
- We need... we need clarity,

37:56.642 --> 37:57.974
and right now
we don't have clarity.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.809
We need to proceed slowly.

37:59.811 --> 38:00.944
Well, let's just quit, then.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.982
<i>Right now we fall into
two camps.</i>

38:05.984 --> 38:08.652
<i>Should we aggressively
excavate this thing</i>

38:08.654 --> 38:11.755
<i>or shall we try
and be less invasive?</i>

38:11.757 --> 38:15.492
And it bears saying,
this is hideously expensive.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.761
We have a lot of equipment,
people,

38:17.763 --> 38:20.030
and they need to get paid
whether they're running or not.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.898
That's the rub.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.366
What do you think?

38:23.368 --> 38:26.569
What do you need to say,
"all stop."

38:26.571 --> 38:29.339
Or go to a different method.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.875
I-I think if you
have some definitive proof

38:31.877 --> 38:33.476
that you're sitting on cement.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.679
I don't think we got that.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.748
There's never been a better time
to keep digging than right now.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.451
- You say?
- It's your call, so...

38:43.355 --> 38:45.055
<i>After making a discovery</i>

38:45.057 --> 38:48.091
<i>that they hope will help
solve the Oak Island mystery,</i>

38:48.093 --> 38:50.994
<i>brothers Rick and Marty Lagina</i>

38:50.996 --> 38:54.597
<i>now find themselves
at a crossroads.</i>

38:54.599 --> 38:57.667
<i>Should they use the giant
hammer grab to lift up</i>

38:57.669 --> 39:00.503
<i>whatever lies within
the wooden box?</i>

39:00.505 --> 39:03.406
<i>Or should they wait,</i>

39:03.408 --> 39:06.476
<i>and explore the area
more cautiously,</i>

39:06.478 --> 39:10.647
<i>so that the possible contents
of the box might remain intact.</i>

39:12.451 --> 39:15.585
What would you do?
You know the historical context,

39:15.587 --> 39:18.855
you know how important this is,
you know, you have a sense.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.790
It's been breached before,
though, you need to know that.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.625
By an inch and a quarter core.

39:22.627 --> 39:23.993
There's no way there's an intact
vault there.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.662
I would suggest that we
push on it first,

39:25.664 --> 39:27.530
before we keep cutting,

39:27.532 --> 39:29.666
and see what it does, see if it
gives us that resistance,

39:29.668 --> 39:31.601
and if it does, then

39:31.603 --> 39:32.902
we know we need to look at other
options of excavating out,

39:32.904 --> 39:34.671
or, you know, protecting it.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.953
That's you guys, make that call.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.110
<i>Many people disagree sometimes,</i>

39:40.112 --> 39:44.080
<i>and Rick has a long history
of disagreeing with me.</i>

39:44.082 --> 39:48.718
But I learned a long time
ago that what Rick said is wise,

39:48.720 --> 39:51.755
is smart, and that is to stop,

39:51.757 --> 39:54.424
don't worry about the expenses
for a little bit,

39:54.426 --> 39:56.126
take a deep breath, and think.

39:56.128 --> 39:57.927
If you have to walk off

39:57.929 --> 40:01.164
and be by yourself
or with our group in our case,

40:01.166 --> 40:03.833
and think it through,
that's just smart.

40:03.835 --> 40:07.170
My angst comes from where it
has always come from.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.506
That I think something amazing
happened here

40:09.508 --> 40:12.642
and I don't wanna just
brute force it.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.644
The wonderful thing is
that we have,

40:14.646 --> 40:17.680
obviously, several options.
That's where I'm at.

40:17.682 --> 40:20.116
You know, we could think about
it, so...

40:20.118 --> 40:22.552
Okay, so I say we go
kick this around.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.820
Yup. Yeah.

40:23.822 --> 40:24.988
So let's go back
and talk about it.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.890
- Okay. All right.
- Let's be done.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.825
I'm happy with that decision.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.693
<i>It's an emotional
roller coaster,</i>

40:30.695 --> 40:34.431
and I try not to
let myself ride it.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.834
But, we do ride it,
because we're just humans.

40:37.836 --> 40:39.102
All right, shut down for
tonight?

40:39.104 --> 40:40.570
- Done for the night.
- Good day.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.138
Excellent day, man, well done.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.907
Well done, you guys.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.809
<i>It is a time of both excitement</i>

40:45.811 --> 40:48.077
<i>and satisfaction on Oak Island.</i>

40:48.079 --> 40:49.546
Okay, let's go.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.015
<i>As Rick, Marty, Craig,</i>

40:52.017 --> 40:56.653
<i>and the team decide to suspend
operations after making what</i>

40:56.655 --> 41:00.089
<i>looks to be a huge discovery.</i>

41:00.091 --> 41:03.726
<i>This is the most momentous
decision we need to make.</i>

41:03.728 --> 41:05.929
It's tangible now.

41:05.931 --> 41:10.033
We're within arm's reach
of a box, vault, whatever.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.669
<i>We mustn't make a mistake.</i>

41:12.671 --> 41:16.105
<i>Up until now,
the goal of the team</i>

41:16.107 --> 41:20.810
<i>has been to find out what
lies buried in the Money Pit.</i>

41:20.812 --> 41:23.146
<i>Now that they may have
found something,</i>

41:23.148 --> 41:27.684
<i>they have yet another
problem to solve:</i>

41:27.686 --> 41:30.487
<i>What do they do next?</i>

41:33.892 --> 41:36.993
<i>Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:36.995 --> 41:39.028
There's something very
significant in there,

41:39.030 --> 41:40.697
and I want to proceed slowly.

41:40.699 --> 41:41.698
I don't wanna do that.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.166
We have to find something.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.934
I say drill a hold through
the thing.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.669
That wouldn't scare me.

41:46.671 --> 41:47.770
- Whoa!
- It's a coin!

41:47.772 --> 41:49.672
Wow, look at that.

41:49.674 --> 41:52.075
It's over 200 years old.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.843
There's a lot of uncertainty.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.245
Are we really gonna destroy

41:55.247 --> 41:56.779
whatever it is down there?

41:56.781 --> 41:58.681
That ain't good.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.817
We think there's almost 3,000
gallons in that hole.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.585
And now we don't know
what to do.
