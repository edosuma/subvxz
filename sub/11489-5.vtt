00:01.300 --> 00:02.790
- hey
- hey

00:02.900 --> 00:04.490
what***

00:04.500 --> 00:06.890
***

00:07.500 --> 00:11.090
***

00:12.700 --> 00:14.590
***

00:16.700 --> 00:19.390
you***

00:20.100 --> 00:23.090
***the Datsun 280-Z.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.990
So whatcha you doing?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.490
Paying our household bills.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.390
You're a good wife,Alan.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.690
I can't believe some lucky
fella hasn't snapped you up.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.590
Probably the penis.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.890
That's usually a d eal-breaker.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.190
So,how are we doing bill-wise?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.590
Not very well.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.590
Are you aware you haven't had a
paying job in over nine months?

00:50.600 --> 00:53.990
Are you aware that urine
cures athlete's foot?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.890
Seriously,you've got a big pile
of bills and no money coming in.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.790
Seriously, no itching,no burning,

01:04.800 --> 01:06.590
just clears it right up.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.890
The drug companies don't want you
to know about it because it's free.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.990
Charlie,you're unemployed!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.090
I know.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.990
Haven't you heard? The
jingle business is dead.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.390
How would I hear that?
Who would have told me?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.690
It was in all the jingle magazines.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.990
You know,before they
went out of business.

01:29.100 --> 01:31.190
Everybody's using old rock songs now.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.990
They're not gonna hire a guy like
me to write a jingle for tampons

01:34.000 --> 01:36.790
when they can just play "Stuck
in the Middle with You. "

01:44.100 --> 01:45.990
This doesn't concern you at all?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.590
Nah,something will turn up.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.090
How can you be so sure?

01:49.100 --> 01:52.190
Hey,do you have any idea how
I got in the jingle business?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.790
- No.
- Neither do I.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.790
But look how good that worked out.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.790
Charlie,you cannot just depend
on the kindness of the universe.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.090
I have to.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.790
I don't have an older
brother I can sponge off of.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.990
Now,if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go pee on my feet.

02:56.700 --> 02:57.890
Okay...

02:59.400 --> 03:00.990
Oh,crap.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.990
Berta,you got a minute?

03:05.300 --> 03:06.790
What's on your mind, Princess?

03:08.400 --> 03:09.790
Well,um,first and foremost,

03:09.800 --> 03:13.490
you know that we consider you
a beloved member of this family.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.990
Alan,you can roll
manure in powdered sugar,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.290
but it still ain't a jelly donut.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.290
Now,now,see, that right there,

03:22.300 --> 03:25.090
that's one of the things
that we love about you.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.390
- Folksy...
- Spill it,Mildred.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.990
Right,right.Well,I'm not
sure you're aware of this,

03:31.000 --> 03:35.390
but it's been quite some time since
Charlie has had any actual income.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.790
Okay.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.990
And I can't help but notice

03:39.000 --> 03:44.190
that you're the only beloved family
member actually drawing a salary.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.790
I'm also the only beloved family member

03:46.800 --> 03:49.890
who takes a toothbrush
to your kid's skivvies.

03:51.500 --> 03:55.090
And... and we can never
begin to repay you for that,

03:55.100 --> 03:59.190
but-but during these difficult
financial times we all have to...

03:59.700 --> 04:01.990
For the record,it's
not my toothbrush,right?

04:04.800 --> 04:07.990
Not right now,but cut my
pay and all bets are off.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.990
Come on,Berta. Be reasonable.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.190
This might be more than just a
temporary dry spell for Charlie.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.290
Look,I know things may
seem dark right now,

04:16.300 --> 04:18.690
but I've known Charlie a
lot longer than you have.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.690
Um,technically, that's not true.

04:20.700 --> 04:22.590
Are you gonna let me talk?

04:23.500 --> 04:24.590
Sorry.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.690
One thing I've learned working
for Mr. Charles Roscoe Harper...

04:27.700 --> 04:28.790
His middle name isn't Roscoe...

04:28.800 --> 04:30.890
Who's telling the story?!

04:32.800 --> 04:34.090
Continue.

04:34.100 --> 04:38.890
Anyway,what I've learned is God
takes care of drunks and fools,

04:38.900 --> 04:41.290
and C. Roscoe Harper is both.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.990
His middle name is Francis.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.690
Hey. What's going on?

04:53.700 --> 04:55.490
Trying to save you a
little money around here.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.890
Ah. Good man.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.390
Appreciate it.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.390
Check out what I bought Linda.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.590
Diamond earrings?

05:06.600 --> 05:08.490
She's a classy woman,Alan.

05:08.500 --> 05:12.590
She's not going be impressed with a
continental breakfast and a copy of the video.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.790
Be that as it may,

05:18.800 --> 05:20.890
you can't keep spending
money you don't have.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.490
Oh,relax.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.590
Something will turn up.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.790
Will you stop saying that?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.190
Things don't just "turn up. "

05:26.200 --> 05:27.590
You're living in a dream world.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.090
Money doesn't just fall from the sky.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.590
Obviously,you've never
been sitting ringside

05:32.600 --> 05:35.290
when a pole dancer hangs upside down.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.490
So did you buy this for your girlfriend
because you're breaking up with her?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.190
No.Why would you think that?

05:47.200 --> 05:50.390
Because you always give jewelry to
girls you're getting ready to dump.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.390
Very observant.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.490
You watch,you learn.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.890
Well,this isn't "breakup" jewelry.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.290
This is "I like you,
stick around" jewelry.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.590
What's the difference?

06:02.600 --> 06:04.890
About 1,500 bucks.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.490
But let's back up a step.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.190
A gentleman never "dumps" a lady.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.690
He merely acknowledges the fact

06:13.700 --> 06:18.490
that a relationship has run its course
by presenting her with a memento,

06:18.500 --> 06:21.590
a keepsake,if you will,
of their time together.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.690
Remember that big blonde who
threw the toaster oven at you?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.790
Yeah,I remember.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.390
Or when that yoga teacher who chucked the
fire extinguisher through your windshield?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.190
Yeah,yeah,yeah.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.790
And there was that
actress who set fire...

06:34.800 --> 06:37.590
It's not a perfect system,Jake.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.290
Oh,Charlie...

06:44.300 --> 06:45.790
they're beautiful.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.990
You do realize I was going to
sleep with you tonight anyway.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.090
This is just a little bonus.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.990
Like when you get to a baseball
game and find out it's helmet night.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.190
You silver-tongued devil.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.090
Well,I don't know about silver,
but you'll find I am tongued.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.690
If you ignore that,

07:08.700 --> 07:11.590
there's a matching
necklace in it for you.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.990
Why don't you open the wine?

07:17.100 --> 07:19.090
Gary,what are you doing here?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.390
I'm sorry,I tried to call,
but your line's been busy.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.290
What do you mean my line's been busy?

07:23.300 --> 07:24.190
I haven't been on the phone.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.390
Well,I must've called 20 times.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.190
Fine.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.590
I have to go to New York
tonight and I can't take Brandon.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.490
- Butlhave company.
- And I have an emergency board...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.690
Who are you?

07:35.700 --> 07:36.790
I'm Charlie.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.290
I'm Brandon.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.190
Nice to meet you,Brandon.

07:40.600 --> 07:41.590
You know...

07:41.600 --> 07:43.990
I have a nephew about your age.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.290
Hey,Dad,did you give Mom a
present when you got divorced?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.190
A present?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.990
Yeah,a mento of your time together.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.790
Jake,buddy,you're the
memento of our time together.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.490
So you were too cheap
to get her earrings.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.590
She did better than earrings.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.890
She got my family jewels.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.490
- Hi,honey.
- Hi,Mom.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.090
When you die,do I get
Dad's family jewels?

08:16.600 --> 08:17.490
What?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.390
Nothing. Just go inside.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.090
Okay,well,thanks for dropping him off.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.990
Uh,Judith,hang on a second.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.490
What?

08:24.500 --> 08:27.290
Um... how's it going?

08:27.800 --> 08:28.790
Good.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.890
So your,uh,your new marriage
going well?Herb's okay?

08:31.900 --> 08:33.590
What do you want,Alan?

08:34.500 --> 08:36.690
Charlie's jingle business is
dead, and I'm going to be homeless.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.190
Well,you can't stayhere.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.890
Oh,no,no...

08:40.299 --> 08:41.590
That's not what I was getting at,

08:41.600 --> 08:45.090
but it's good to know
that door is firmly closed.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.590
Uh,no,what I was hoping was that we
could talk about the child support.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.390
What about my child support?

08:52.800 --> 08:56.290
Ah,ah. Well,technically
it's Jake's child support,

08:56.500 --> 08:58.890
hence the term "child," um...

08:59.900 --> 09:02.890
But I-I just thought maybe
we could make some trims.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.090
Uh,for instance, the karate classes,

09:05.100 --> 09:06.590
the,uh,archery lessons,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.490
the algebra tutor.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.290
I mean,I don't know about you,

09:10.300 --> 09:11.790
but,uh,I've never seen him, you know,

09:11.800 --> 09:14.590
break a board or,uh, string a bow.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.490
And,uh,and the algebra tutor,
I mean,who are we kidding?

09:18.900 --> 09:21.590
That's like putting swim fins on a cat.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.190
He needs the tutor;
he likes the lessons;

09:24.200 --> 09:25.790
and I'm not going to
ask Herb to pay for them.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.090
That's okay. I'll ask him. Is he home?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.290
Good-bye,Alan.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.190
How about I stay in Jake's
tree house?!He never uses it!

09:36.700 --> 09:39.890
Kid doesn't even like to climb stairs.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.790
Come on,sweetheart,
just one little bite.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.290
No.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.090
He's not usually this cranky.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.390
Have you tried a little
whiskey in his sippy cup?

09:50.900 --> 09:51.990
Charlie.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.490
I'm just saying. It
worked on my brother.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.790
You really did that?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.890
I still do it.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.890
You know what? I'm just
going to make him a hot dog.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.790
You want a hot dog?

10:01.800 --> 10:03.290
Sure.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.790
I was talking to my son.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.590
What,you just got the one?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.990
I'll be right back.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.490
Come on,kid,just have a
little corn,and then bedtime.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.090
For both of us.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.790
No.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.590
Oh,for the love of God.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.390
I don't come to Gymboree and
knock the blocks out ofyourhand.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.890
Come on.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.090
It's corn-tastic.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.590
I like corn, it tastes real sweet

10:35.600 --> 10:38.590
I don't like peas They taste like feet

10:40.800 --> 10:43.590
Corn's the king of the veggie food group

10:44.100 --> 10:47.190
And it looks the same
when it's in your poop.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.790
Son of a bitch.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.090
I mean,"Golly!"

11:09.000 --> 11:10.190
Hi,Mom.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.290
Hello,Alan.

11:12.300 --> 11:14.590
Uh... got a minute?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.190
Mm... sure.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.490
I
- I mean,could you come to the door?

11:27.500 --> 11:29.790
Uh... no.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.990
Please. Mom,it's important.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.290
I'm... I'm having a real crisis here.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.090
Oh,darling,I'm so sorry.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.090
Well,good luck with that.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.990
Mom,please.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.390
I'm such a pushover.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.790
The money isn't just for me.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.390
It's for Charlie and your only grandson.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.690
I'll just be a minute,Teddy!

12:01.400 --> 12:03.490
What can I do for you,Alan?

12:06.700 --> 12:08.590
Nothing. Never mind.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.990
What? I'm not entitled to a love life?

12:16.300 --> 12:19.190
I'm ready for my punishment, headmaster.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.790
So... you must be getting tired,huh?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.290
No shame in calling it a night.

12:34.300 --> 12:36.290
I got to go pee-pee.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.790
All right,go ahead.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.990
First pee-pee,then
beddy-bye.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.290
Beats the other way around. Trust me.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.390
I got to go pee-pee now.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.990
Linda,he says he's got to go pee-pee!

12:47.000 --> 12:48.790
Would you mind taking him?

12:48.800 --> 12:49.890
Me?

12:49.900 --> 12:52.990
He can't undo his pants,
and I'm doing the dishes.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.190
Fine. Let's go pee-pee.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.590
Don't feel bad.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.490
I can't always undo my pants,either.

13:06.300 --> 13:07.490
What are you waiting for?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.990
I don't have to anymore.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.690
Linda,he says he
doesn't have to anymore!

13:12.700 --> 13:15.490
Trust me: he has to.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.890
You heard the lady. Let 'er rip.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.290
No.

13:21.000 --> 13:21.890
Okay.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.090
Okay,how about this?

13:24.700 --> 13:27.290
You're a giant, and there's a...

13:27.300 --> 13:30.590
there's a tiny village in the
toilet bowl that's on fire,

13:30.600 --> 13:34.890
and you have to put it out
by whizzing all over it.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.290
Hey,look!

13:37.300 --> 13:39.790
Here comes the giant now!

13:41.500 --> 13:43.290
I had a root beer

13:43.300 --> 13:44.990
I had a Coke

13:45.000 --> 13:46.890
I need to pee

13:46.900 --> 13:48.790
Hey,I smell smoke.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.890
Giant,giant

13:50.900 --> 13:52.690
Up in the sky

13:52.700 --> 13:56.090
Grab your firehose, let it fly!

13:57.500 --> 13:58.790
Close your windows

13:58.800 --> 14:00.290
Lock your doors

14:00.300 --> 14:04.790
'Cause when I rain, it really pours.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.090
There you go.

14:10.700 --> 14:11.790
Hey,hey,hey.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.290
I'm the only one who
gets to pee on my feet.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.190
Come on,buddy, right in here.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.590
Hey,Berta, look what I got.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.890
Big deal... it's a freaking
miracle you don't have ten of 'em.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.790
This is Linda's son,Brandon.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.490
I'm Brandon.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.990
I got ears.

14:37.400 --> 14:38.690
So,what's he doing here?

14:38.700 --> 14:39.790
I'm baby-sitting.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.490
- You?
- Why not me?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.390
You're a rum-soaked degenerate.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.590
Yeah,but it turns out,
I have child skills.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.190
I already got him to eat his vegetables
and make pee-pee in the toilet.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.990
So,"Do as I say, not as I do," huh?

14:54.300 --> 14:56.290
Ha. Ha. Ha.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.690
Are you gonna help me or what?

14:57.700 --> 15:00.290
Hey,his mom's not throwing me any.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.790
Don't get the wrong idea.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.090
Your mom and I are actually
in a committed relationship.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.590
So if I sign up for this drug trial...

15:17.000 --> 15:18.490
I take these pills not knowing

15:18.500 --> 15:21.590
if I'm getting the actual
anxiety medication or a placebo?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.990
That's correct.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.190
The test group gets
the actual medication,

15:25.200 --> 15:28.590
and the control group is
being given sugar pills.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.890
So,is there anything
I should know about?

15:31.900 --> 15:34.090
Any side effects or anything?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.390
Well,that's one of the
purposes of the research,

15:37.600 --> 15:38.990
but in tests of this nature,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.790
common side effects
include dry mouth,hair loss,

15:42.800 --> 15:45.090
blurred vision,inflamed gums...

15:45.100 --> 15:45.990
Okay.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.390
...mild nausea,heart
palpitations,liver damage...

15:50.200 --> 15:53.190
...boils,shingles,

15:53.200 --> 15:57.390
sudden fainting and temporary
darkening of the stool.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.690
Good Lord.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.090
How much do you pay people to do this?

16:04.100 --> 16:05.590
A thousand dollars a week.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.090
I'm in.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.890
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.590
That's not a toy.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.690
That's how I make my living.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.290
Not so much anymore,
but still,be careful.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.790
I want to play.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.590
All right.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.090
Play... this one.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.590
And... this one.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.090
That's great.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.090
Now it's my turn.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.890
This is a little tune
I wrote for my nephew

16:49.900 --> 16:52.590
when he was feeling down in the dumps.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.390
I know that the winter follows the fall

16:59.200 --> 17:02.990
And in New York, the buildings are tall

17:05.599 --> 17:09.089
I hear that in China,
they have a great wall

17:10.800 --> 17:13.490
I know these things and more

17:14.000 --> 17:19.490
But there's just one answer
I'm still looking for...

17:23.500 --> 17:24.990
Who cut the cheese?

17:25.599 --> 17:26.790
Who cut the cheese?!

17:27.099 --> 17:30.090
I ask you please, did
you cut the cheese?

17:30.700 --> 17:31.990
I'm not averse to learning

17:32.000 --> 17:34.190
Tell me why my eyes are burning

17:34.500 --> 17:36.290
Who cut the cheese?

17:36.300 --> 17:37.790
Everybody!

17:37.800 --> 17:39.390
Who cut the cheese?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.090
Who cut the cheese?

17:41.100 --> 17:44.390
I ask you please, did
you cut the cheese?

17:44.900 --> 17:46.290
I'm not averse to learning

17:46.300 --> 17:48.290
Tell me why my eyes are burning

17:48.800 --> 17:51.690
Who cut the cheese...?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.990
I can't thank you enough.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.590
No problem. We had fun.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.990
Look,um,after I drop
him off at his dad's,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.990
why don't I come back and show my
appreciation for those earrings?

18:12.000 --> 18:15.090
Gee,I'd love to,but
it's been a long day.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.490
I just want to soak in a hot
bath and have a little "me" time.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.390
Oh,come on,Charlie.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.190
Hey,hey,while you were
off having fun at work,

18:24.200 --> 18:27.890
I was cooped up all day in this
house taking care of your child.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.690
Okay,sorry.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.090
I'm just saying...

18:31.100 --> 18:32.590
I'm not a light switch.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.090
I'll call you later.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.390
No,wait,wait.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.290
I made something for Brandon.

18:41.900 --> 18:46.290
I sang some songs for him, and he seemed
to like them,so I burned 'em onto a CD.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.890
Oh,how sweet.

18:47.900 --> 18:48.790
Sweet?

18:48.800 --> 18:51.090
Clearly,you're not
familiar with my work.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.290
Anyway,he seemed to dig it.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.390
Well,thank you.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.590
Hi... Alan.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.090
Hi.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.390
I don't think I'm in the control group.

19:40.200 --> 19:43.190
Are you really sure you should
be taking those pills with beer?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.490
What else can happen to me,Charlie?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.990
My hair is coming out. I'm
having fainting spells...

19:50.600 --> 19:53.590
I can see my heart
beating through my shirt

19:54.600 --> 19:57.190
and my poop looks
like charcoal briquets.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.190
So stop taking the medication.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.290
It's a thousand dollars
a week. We need the money.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.690
Oh,relax. Something'll turn up.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.690
Something's already turned up.

20:06.700 --> 20:09.390
I'm pretty sure I
dropped a third testicle.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.190
Hello?

20:17.600 --> 20:18.790
Hang on.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.390
It's Linda's ex-husband.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.690
He wants to talk to you.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.390
I don't want to talk
to him. You talk to him.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.290
I'm not gonna talk to him.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.890
Come on,you've got 30%
more balls than I do.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.790
Hello.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.490
Yeah,this is Charlie.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.590
What about Brandon?

20:39.400 --> 20:40.590
Oh,good,good.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.790
I'm-I'm glad he likes the songs.

20:43.300 --> 20:46.090
Yeah,Linda mentioned you
were in the music business.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.890
Well,that's flattering,

20:48.900 --> 20:51.790
but I already have a very
lucrative career writing jingles.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.590
I don't see myself walking away
from that to record children's songs.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.590
How much?

21:01.200 --> 21:02.990
I'm in.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.690
How about that? Something turned up.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.790
Send the papers over.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.690
Great. Great.

21:14.300 --> 21:18.790
No,no,I love kids and more
important, they love me.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.590
No,no,no,no,none of my own.
