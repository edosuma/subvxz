00:05.338 --> 00:08.008
My name is Bridget.
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.551
Just get up
on the stand

00:09.592 --> 00:10.885
and tell the judge
what you saw.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.262
And we'll
protect you.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.513
BRIDGET: You don't get it.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.932
If Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.269
I ran to my sister Siobhan
for help.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.104
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:21.146 --> 00:24.024
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.525
It was so easy.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.069
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.405
They all think that I'm her--
her husband,

00:30.447 --> 00:32.282
her best friend...

00:34.784 --> 00:36.077
her lover...

00:36.119 --> 00:37.412
Tell me what you
did to my wife.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.247
BRIDGET: the only person
I could trust.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.832
Something's not right here.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.627
Charlie has another address.
I need to check it out.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.797
OK, Gemma, you're not
going to make a peep.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.758
Charlie, you've gone
above and beyond

00:49.799 --> 00:51.760
the call of duty
of a sponsor.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.887
I'm just trying
to figure out why.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.598
I'm just a good guy,
I guess.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.892
Siobhan, she's on to me.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.358
Hey, you OK?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.860
Yeah. You?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.195
I'm OK.
Just a little freaked out.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.863
Did you find the gun?

01:11.905 --> 01:14.491
No. I searched most
of Charlie's apartment.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.951
I got out of there after
you texted.

01:16.993 --> 01:20.038
But I found something
else--Charlie's cell.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.664
The thing's dead,
though.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.999
Too late to get
a charger tonight.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.834
I'll pick one up
in the morning.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.336
Hopefully we'll get
some answers then.

01:26.377 --> 01:29.005
-OK.
-I'll call you in the morning.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.765
-Andrew?
-I'm in here.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.983
Oh, my God.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.571
It's not overkill, is it?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.366
I know white roses
are your favorite.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.451
It's amazing.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.245
What did I do
to deserve this?

02:03.081 --> 02:06.334
Well, I know it's not
until tomorrow, but I--

02:06.376 --> 02:09.420
I wanted to say,
Happy anniversary.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.175
Thank you.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.219
Can you believe
it's been 6 years?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.846
Feels like...

02:17.887 --> 02:18.471
6 weeks?

02:22.517 --> 02:27.147
I made reservations at
Daniel for 8:30 tomorrow.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.857
You'll get your
real gift then.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.025
Real gift?
Wait. There's more?

02:31.067 --> 02:34.154
Trust me, you're
going to love it.

02:34.195 --> 02:38.324
I--I don't have
anything for you.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.909
I have everything I need.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.706
I love you.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.714
I love you, too.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.510
It's been a while
since we've said that.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.973
Feels pretty good, huh?

03:02.015 --> 03:03.516
Uh-huh.

Oui, monsieur.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.727
Andrew found out
that I was in Paris.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.146
I--I slipped up, and I used
my credit card.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.481
He asked me to come back.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.734
He wanted to work
things out.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.320
So the second I leave,
you sneak off.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.113
We've been together
6 years.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.406
I have a stepdaughter.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.534
I had to at least try.

06:08.576 --> 06:09.869
I thought you were
going to be in Rome.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.287
I had no idea you would
be in New York.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.081
What do you want,
Siobhan?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.043
I know you didn't fly back
just to say you're sorry.

06:20.421 --> 06:26.094
Andrew and I didn't
exactly work things out.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.179
Oh, my God.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.472
I know.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.681
He hit you?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.943
Andrew puts on a good face,

06:41.984 --> 06:44.946
but he's not the man
that you think he is.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.697
I'm sorry for lying to you.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.033
My husband is an incredibly
powerful man.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.701
He was never going
to let me just walk away.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.036
I had to do something.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.623
You have insider
information.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.375
I needed your help.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.129
So you targeted me because
Andrew was my boss?

07:01.170 --> 07:02.422
Asked me to do
something illegal

07:02.463 --> 07:05.007
that could have
destroyed my career?

07:05.049 --> 07:07.176
I know. And I can't
even begin to tell you

07:07.218 --> 07:09.011
how sorry I am.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.471
And I can't believe that
you pretended to like me

07:10.513 --> 07:12.515
just to get back
at your husband.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.186
I did...at first.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.980
But then
something happened.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.359
I started to have
feelings for you.

07:25.361 --> 07:28.197
The other stuff doesn't
matter anymore.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.116
I came back to Paris
for you.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.789
You may want to put
some ice on that.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.805
What would Charlie
want with Gemma?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.807
It doesn't make sense.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.226
Well, if he didn't want
something,

07:57.268 --> 07:59.479
why would he
have her cell phone?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.189
The door to the basement
was padlocked.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.982
Why would you do that

08:03.024 --> 08:04.692
if you weren't trying
to hide something?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.277
I don't know. A lot of
people lock their basements.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.279
If Charlie is behind
the hit on Siobhan,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.239
what's the reasoning
behind taking Gemma?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.783
Maybe he's trying to hurt
everyone around her.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.035
I don't know.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.164
-Where you going?
-To Charlie's.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.665
You're not going there.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.709
I already broke
in there once.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.461
-We got to call the cops.
-And tell them what?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.213
That you broke
into his house to steal

08:25.254 --> 08:26.589
an already stolen gun?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.132
Oh, and by the way,

08:28.174 --> 08:29.842
you found the missing
woman's cell phone?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.844
I'm not saying tell
them the whole truth.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.889
Just make them suspicious
enough to search his place.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.516
Make Charlie open that door.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.059
If your friend's
life's on the line...

Pleasant surprise.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.234
Just wanted to stop by
and say thank you again.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.777
That's not necessary.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.196
Just glad to see
you're doing well.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.199
Well, I'm off to work.
Can't wait for tonight.

-Happy anniversary.

Can you believe it?

09:26.440 --> 09:28.109
NYPD. We have
some questions.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.945
I'm Detective Towers.
This is Detective Saldana.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.573
-Elizabeth Saldana?
-Yeah.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.075
You worked with a buddy
of mine--Steve Norman.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.452
How do you know Steve?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.413
He was my partner
for 5 years.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.998
You NYPD?

09:42.039 --> 09:43.874
I'm retired.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.626
So what can I do
for you guys?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.421
We're investigating a lead
in a missing person's case.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.715
You ever hear
of Gemma Butler?

09:50.756 --> 09:53.301
The architect? Yeah, I read
about her in the paper.

09:53.342 --> 09:55.553
Do you know Malcolm Ward?

09:55.595 --> 09:58.055
Yeah. From N.A.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.849
He's been making
some allegations.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.018
He claims you've been
misrepresenting yourself.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.853
That you call yourself
Charlie Young.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.980
I do--in group.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.065
I don't like using
my real name.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.526
It's called
Narcotics Anonymous.

10:10.568 --> 10:14.530
Mr. Ward also says you--
you have a fake apartment.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.490
Wow. You know, this guy
needed a place to stay

10:16.532 --> 10:18.326
so I put him up
in my apartment.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.494
Then I come here
to my mother's old place...

10:20.536 --> 10:22.163
She recently passed.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.873
Does this look
familiar?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.794
Look, Elizabeth, they all
look alike to me.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.713
This belongs
to Gemma Butler.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.257
Mr. Ward claims he found
it at your place.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.509
Look, guys, I know you're
just doing your job,

10:35.551 --> 10:38.512
but Malcolm Ward--
he's a drug addict.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.973
He's been clean for what,
6 days?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.975
I wouldn't take
his word as gospel.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.561
Now that said,
I got nothing to hide.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.188
Come on in.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.777
-Sorry about the trouble.
-It's all good.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.788
[horn honking]

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790

never seen the cell phone

11:05.831 --> 11:07.208
or Gemma Butler.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.459
And you believe him?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.253
His place came up clean.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.463
We're running prints
on the phone,

11:12.505 --> 11:13.839
but right now,
there's no proof.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.383
And it's your word against his.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.593
Would you mind coming down
to the station with us?

11:17.635 --> 11:19.261
What for?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.013
You think Malcolm
is involved in this?!

11:21.055 --> 11:23.015
I don't think anything,
Mrs. Martin.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.101
But let me tell you
what I know:

11:25.142 --> 11:27.103
Malcolm Ward--the sponsor
of Bridget Kelly,

11:27.144 --> 11:28.729
who right now is
the main suspect in

11:28.771 --> 11:30.356
Gemma Butler's
disappearance--

11:30.398 --> 11:33.401
is somehow in possession
of the victim's cell phone.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.778
I told you I found it
in Charlie's apartment.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.988
We spoke
to Mr. Delario's neighbor.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.657
She saw a man who fits
your description

11:39.699 --> 11:42.618
breaking into Mr. Delario's
second residence last night.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.246
The same residence you
allege you've never been to.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.207
Let's get this
over with.

11:48.249 --> 11:49.667
Then I'm going.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.960
You've already been
questioned, Mrs. Martin.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.169
It's not necessary.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.796
I don't really care
if it's...

11:53.838 --> 11:55.756
Siobhan, please.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.050
Just give us a second.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.598
Charlie's a smart guy.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.475
If Gemma wasn't
in the basement,

12:06.517 --> 12:07.893
then he must've
moved her.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.145
He's also an ex-cop.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.604
So no matter what I say,

12:10.646 --> 12:12.857
they're gonna believe him
over an ex-junkie.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.984
And he knows it.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.986
Just let me answer
their questions.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.280
I got nothing to hide.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.282
Fine.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.170
Siobhan, I knew
your frigging sister

12:34.211 --> 12:36.046
knew something.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.132
I just didn't know
how much.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.759
Calm down, John.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.886
Don't you tell me
to calm down!

12:44.054 --> 12:46.724
She knows my real name,

12:46.766 --> 12:48.559
she knows where I live.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.853
And her dick friend stole
the frigging cell phone.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.607
They know I got Gemma.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.358
Where is she?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.110
I moved her...

12:58.152 --> 13:00.196
before the cops got here.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.781
If I didn't realize

13:01.822 --> 13:03.574
that someone
had been in my house,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.367
she'd still be
in the basement

13:05.409 --> 13:06.952
and I'd be in jail.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.455
Well, what do
you want to do?

13:09.497 --> 13:13.542
You know,
Gemma knows too much.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.631
I think it's time
we got rid of her.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.133
No! No way.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.593
You're just supposed
to keep her quiet.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.136
That's the plan.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.346
The plan changed.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.014
John, if you
hurt her, I sw...

13:27.056 --> 13:28.349
Oh, would you
just spare me?

13:28.390 --> 13:29.558
I think it's a little
late to pretend

13:29.600 --> 13:31.185
that you still give
a damn about her!

13:31.227 --> 13:33.687
She's my friend.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.064
Yeah. I'd hate

13:35.105 --> 13:37.024
to see how you
treat your enemies.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.697
OK, John, look, there's
no reason for us to argue.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.866
I need you. I know that.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.368
What do you want?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.791
Double what you
promised me.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.962
Fine. But it's gonna take
me a little bit of time

13:58.003 --> 13:59.588
to access that kind
of money.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.175
Yeah, all right.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.885
Well, If I'm gonna do
this pro bono,

14:04.927 --> 14:06.095
we're gonna do
this my way.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.596
John, please!

14:07.638 --> 14:09.807
No, sorry, Siobhan.
Game over.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.727
You no longer get
a say.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.607
John!
[sighs]

14:24.488 --> 14:26.574
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

14:29.034 --> 14:30.202
Hey.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.956
Heard you were in town.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.500
Welcome back to Wyoming.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.627
Great to be back.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.047
You got a rundown
on the victim?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.632
Mary Curtis.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.138
Rock Springs local.
Mother of one.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.890
Dancer at Club Caged.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.809
Bridget's not the only
answer to locking up Bodaway

14:53.851 --> 14:55.227
thanks to you.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.855
Don't sweet-talk
a sweet talker, Vic.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.732
I'm just a blabbermouth
stripper.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.191
Let's not pretend
I'm anything else.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.902
No, no, you're my informant.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.111
And I don't take
that lightly.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.284
I'm sure Bodaway's got
an airtight alibi.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.577
Mary was last seen
pulling into

15:11.619 --> 15:14.580
the motel parking lot
early this morning.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.789
OK.

15:23.756 --> 15:28.302
Anyone in your department
that you're not 100% on?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.887
Detective Hanes is
a Red Sox fan,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.389
but I'm not gonna
hold that against him.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.558
They're all stand-up guys
as far as I can tell. Why?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.810
I knew her.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.729
She was my C.I.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.230
Bodaway say anything else

15:40.272 --> 15:41.899
about this guy
on the inside?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.819
No. Just keeps calling
him "The Matador."

15:45.861 --> 15:47.446
[chuckles softly]

15:47.488 --> 15:50.240
Ever see him
or hear him?

15:50.282 --> 15:53.077
No. Everything happens
in the basement of the club.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.536
No girls allowed.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.707
-Hey, Vic.
-Yeah?

15:58.749 --> 16:00.084
If you find Bridget...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.837
tell her I miss her.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.714
A few weeks ago she told me

16:05.756 --> 16:08.425
that Bodaway's got a man
inside your department.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.052
Hold on.
We've been working

16:10.094 --> 16:11.720
the Macawi case together
what, for two years?

16:11.762 --> 16:13.055
And in all that time, you
never thought to mention

16:13.097 --> 16:15.099
that you had an informant
feeding you tips?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.101
No. Mary Curtis wasn't
my C.I. the whole time.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.311
Shaylene Briggs was
till Bodaway killed her.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.521
-You serious?
-Yes.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.523
I just started
working with Mary.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.191
I gave her my word that
I'd keep her a secret...

16:24.233 --> 16:24.817
even from my colleagues.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.905
I'm sorry, man. This has
gotta be rough for you.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.532
The inside man must've

16:31.573 --> 16:33.409
been following Mary.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.952
She told me Bodaway's
nickname for him.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.704
What's the name?

16:36.745 --> 16:39.623
"Matador."
Mean anything to you?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.875
No. I'll sniff around.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.335
OK. Just be careful, OK?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.129
Last thing I need
is another body.

16:57.599 --> 17:01.437
OK, what do you mean
that Charlie took Gemma?

17:01.478 --> 17:02.855
I thought he was supposed
to be helping us.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.649
I mean, you said that this guy
could be trusted.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.526
I was wrong.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.862
Does Charlie have something
to do with your sister?

17:09.903 --> 17:11.780
-No.
-But he knows you.

17:11.822 --> 17:14.116
Yes, but I...

17:14.158 --> 17:16.201
OK, why do all roads
lead back to Siobhan Martin?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.703
How many times
are we gonna do this?

17:17.745 --> 17:19.538
I had nothing to do with
Gemma's disappearance.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.415
And yet the only suspects
are your twin

17:21.457 --> 17:24.918
and a guy that you brought
into our lives.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.004
I didn't come here to play
the blame game, OK?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.672
I came for help.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.424
Malcolm thinks that Gemma
was in Charlie's basement,

17:30.466 --> 17:31.967
but he must've
moved her.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.803
Who--who the hell is Malcolm?

17:34.845 --> 17:36.430
He's a friend of mine.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.890
Another friend helping out?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.516
That's awesome, Siobhan,
that's awesome.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.851
So what is he gonna
turn out to be?

17:40.893 --> 17:43.854
A mob boss? A serial
killer? Al-Qaeda?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.272
I'm just trying
to find Gemma.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.732
And you don't think
that I want that, too?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.692
I have not slept in weeks!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.319
My kids miss their mom
like crazy!

17:50.360 --> 17:53.197
All I want is
for Gemma to come home!

17:53.238 --> 17:54.531
OK, then help me
find her.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.075
Stop, stop! Don't you get it?!

17:56.116 --> 17:57.284
Every time
that you get involved,

17:57.326 --> 17:58.494
it just makes
matters worse.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.953
You are not a cop.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.580
So stay out of it, Siobhan.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.082
Let the police do their job.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.755
[whispers]
OK, fine.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.931
[bell ringing]

18:20.474 --> 18:22.434
All right, start by
separating trash

18:22.476 --> 18:24.144
from recycling.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.854
If you're not sure if
something's recyclable,

18:25.896 --> 18:27.856
look for the "chasing arrow"
symbol on the bottom.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.483
Thanks for being
here, Tessa.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.026
Mmm. See, I don't have
a choice.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.236
It's called detention.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.862
Well, the planet
still thanks you.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.410
Mr. C. is so hot.

18:40.452 --> 18:43.288
Ew. He wears ties and is,
like, a thousand.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.498
Ties are sexy.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.250
And he's only 30.
Besides...

18:46.291 --> 18:47.459
Guys, there's trash
everywhere here.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.336
Let's go, huh?

18:49.378 --> 18:50.879
Bella married Edward
when she was a teenager,

18:50.921 --> 18:52.256
and he's, like, 400.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.925
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.510
-Thanks. Thank you.
-Thanks.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.138
I'm so psyched
to go green.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.932
I appreciate the enthusiasm.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.063
Wow. Yeah, he, like,
hates you.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.149
No, he doesn't.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.568
He's just
playing it cool.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.194
We totally have
a connection.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.404
Huh?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.993
[indistinct chatter]

19:23.120 --> 19:24.580

can you do about it?

19:24.621 --> 19:26.039
I mean, please.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.791
It's all
my own fault.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.585
Siobhan, you remember
Charlie Young,

19:29.626 --> 19:32.337
Malcolm's sponsor?

19:32.379 --> 19:34.506
Hey. It's been a while.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.761
Charlie wanted to stop by

19:39.803 --> 19:41.096
and give us an update
on Malcolm.

19:41.138 --> 19:45.517
-Isn't that nice?
-Hmm. Very.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.144
ANDREW: Look, I don't
want to be rude,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.813
but I have to run a couple
of errands before tonight.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.565
You're leaving me?

19:51.607 --> 19:54.985
Trust me. You're gonna want
me to run these errands.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.321
It's our anniversary.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.948
It's your anniversary?
Oh, well, congratulations.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.451
Thank you.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.744
Don't worry,
Mrs. Martin.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.995
I'm not gonna keep you
here that long.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.956
-A pleasure.
-Mm-hmm.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.208
See you later, darling.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.345
Sit your ass down.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.055
You try anything,

20:23.096 --> 20:26.016
I'll have cops swarming
this place in 30 seconds.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.268
Oh, relax. I'm not here
to hurt you.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.770
You could've fooled me.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.067
Whatever it is
you think you know...

20:35.108 --> 20:36.276
you don't.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.780
I know you took Gemma.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.367
Just tell me she's OK.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.369
She's OK.

20:45.410 --> 20:46.995
Why did you take her?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.288
What do you want
from me?

20:48.330 --> 20:50.582
This is not
"20 Questions," Siobhan.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.834
I'm not here for
your edification.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.795
Then what do you want?

20:54.836 --> 20:56.922
I want money.

20:58.924 --> 21:03.136
That's what this is
about? Money?

21:03.178 --> 21:05.097
It's real simple.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.767
You pay me, and I give you
back your friend.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.315
How do I know
I can trust you?

21:15.357 --> 21:17.734
You don't.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.861
But what choice
do you have?

21:32.374 --> 21:34.126
Hiya, Max.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.836
-Hey, Mr. Butler.
-How you doing today?

21:35.877 --> 21:37.504
Pretty good.

21:39.256 --> 21:43.343
Did, uh, did Charlie Young
visit the Martins?

21:43.385 --> 21:45.429
He was just here.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.389
-Is he the guy that just left?
-Yeah.

Hey, it's Jimmy.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.545
I think I know
who Matador is.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.047
Yeah, I'm listening.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.466
Meet me tonight.
The warehouse in Cherokee.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.884
OK.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.526
I know I said
I didn't want anything

22:41.568 --> 22:43.695
for our anniversary,

22:43.737 --> 22:45.906
but I'd be a fool to
turn away cold, hard cash.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.035
What's this?

Siobh...

22:57.667 --> 22:59.294
Siobh, what's wrong?

23:03.590 --> 23:05.509
I know where Gemma is.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.897
Ransom? When were you
going to tell me, Siobh?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.524
Well, I wanted to,

23:20.565 --> 23:22.317
but Charlie said if I
told anyone, that...

23:24.361 --> 23:26.571
I'm supposed to meet him
at Penn Station at 10:00.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.909
What are you doing?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.536
-I'm calling the cops.
-Well, you can't!

23:32.577 --> 23:34.371
You're being blackmailed.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.956
We're calling
Detective Saldana.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.541
Look, Charlie said we
can't tell anyone, OK?

23:37.582 --> 23:38.917
We can't take that risk.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.419
Malcolm already tried
calling the cops,

23:40.460 --> 23:42.003
and it backfired.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.964
Please. It's
a very public place.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.841
Charlie is not stupid.
He's not gonna try anything.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.344
Will you please
just trust me?

23:53.598 --> 23:55.434
OK, fine.

23:55.475 --> 23:56.768
But you're not going alone.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.770
-I don't have a choice.
-Neither do I.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.355

my wife go toe to toe

24:00.397 --> 24:02.190

24:02.232 --> 24:03.400
I'm going with you.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.611
OK.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.321
How much does he want?

24:10.073 --> 24:12.242
$250,000.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.997
I mean,
without even counting,

24:17.038 --> 24:19.207
I know that's not enough.

24:19.249 --> 24:22.210
It's, um...almost $40,000.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.045
It's from my savings.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.756
I wish you'd have
told me sooner, Siobh.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.800
I could've gotten the rest,
but the bank's now closed.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.929

-For the money?

24:32.971 --> 24:34.556
No, no, no. He doesn't
have that sort of money

24:34.598 --> 24:36.558
lying around. No.
Just to tell him.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.101
I mean...it is
his wife.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.352
I was afraid he would
tell his in-laws.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.938
-And...then...
-The police get involved.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.024
I'm out of ideas.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.504
It's stunning.

25:05.545 --> 25:08.298

propose again.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.883

25:09.925 --> 25:11.801
No, it's...

25:11.843 --> 25:13.261
it's not silly.

picking up trash

25:32.197 --> 25:33.615

25:37.911 --> 25:39.287
Yeah, I guess.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.456
So, um...what are
you doing tonight?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.627
Uh, cleaning up,
then grading papers.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.170
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.881
I could stay and help.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.427
-I mean, if you want me to.
-Thanks.

25:54.469 --> 25:56.346
But you've helped out
enough already today.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.847
No, really. It's no
bother. Really.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.307

26:02.352 --> 26:03.728
You need to stop this.

Stop what?

Acting this way.

-It's inappropriate.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:11.861 --> 26:13.947
This kind of behavior's
unacceptable.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.574
And it won't be
tolerated.

flirting with you...

wait in the hall.

doing out here?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.039
I got something for you.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.793
Officer Jesse Provenz.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.713
He's got a cousin who worked
the door at Bodaway's club

27:11.755 --> 27:13.423
and a brand-new speedboat
he likes to take out

27:13.465 --> 27:16.009
to Glendo Reservoir
on the weekends.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.345
You think he bought it
with dirty money?

27:18.386 --> 27:20.347
Well, I wasn't sure,
so I followed him

27:20.388 --> 27:21.848
after he
clocked out tonight.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.350
He came straight here.

27:23.391 --> 27:24.851
Seems like a nice
little spot

27:24.893 --> 27:26.436
for a rendezvous
with Bodaway.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.564
Any idea why Bodaway
would call him "Matador?"

27:29.606 --> 27:31.399
Not a one.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.194
But if we find them
together, maybe we can ask.

What do we do?

28:12.315 --> 28:13.566
We wait.

28:13.608 --> 28:15.235
If he wants his money,
he'll find us.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.828
He's not coming.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.338
I'm sorry.
Andrew wouldn't let me.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.006
CHARLIE: I'm not talking
about London Fog.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.675
I'm talking about the cops.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.636
I didn't call the cops.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.638
Look out the window.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.056
Somebody did.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.531
It wasn't me.

Well, it doesn't matter,
because they're there.

just give me a second chance?

Please, just, just tell
me where I can meet you.

have what you want.

I can get it to you.

doing here?

involved in this?

asked for a ransom.

That's why we're here.

Well, then where
the hell is he?

more about this guy.

check here?

It's a bill

No, I mean Siobhan.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.700
That bitch is still alive.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.828
[gunshot]

36:22.972 --> 36:24.932
Siobhan?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.517
Give me your weapon.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.947
I told you
not to kill Gemma.

36:39.989 --> 36:43.326
Yeah, well, I told you
if I'm taking all the risks,

36:43.367 --> 36:45.536
we were gonna do it my way.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.872
Not anymore.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.999
You're not
a killer, Siobhan.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.834
Otherwise, you would
have put a bullet

36:51.876 --> 36:53.294
right in Bridget's head.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.545
Which, by the way,
would've been

36:54.587 --> 36:56.255
a hell of a lot
easier than getting her

36:56.297 --> 36:58.841
to take the fall for you, so
don't point that gun at me!

37:03.804 --> 37:07.767
Besides, you said so
yourself...

37:07.808 --> 37:09.018
you need me.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.146
I don't.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.731
You're a glorified
babysitter

37:13.773 --> 37:16.067
who got
way too expensive.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.860
OK.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.754
MALCOLM: Thanks for letting
me spend the night...again.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.965
It's not a problem.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.466
Please tell me
the police apologized

38:22.508 --> 38:24.385
when they released you.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.637
They asked me if I
needed a ride home.

38:26.679 --> 38:27.847
That's about it.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.857
Maybe you should go
to bed.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.234
I can't.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.030
If anything happens
to Gemma...

38:44.071 --> 38:46.198
Hey, listen to me,

38:46.240 --> 38:49.285
none of this
is your fault.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.079
[phone rings]

38:52.121 --> 38:53.873
Hello?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.337
I see.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.715
OK. Thank you,
Detective Saldana.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.387
They found Charlie's body.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.807
They think he
killed himself.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.852
Gemma?

39:18.272 --> 39:20.107
I'm so sorry, Siobh.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.405
[sobbing]

39:38.250 --> 39:40.044
[phone rings]

39:40.086 --> 39:41.545
SIOBHAN: Hello.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.130
TYLER:
It's me. Where are you?

39:43.172 --> 39:44.507
New York.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.467
I'm going to have to
stay here for a while.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.719
Figured as much.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.721
Did I wake you?

39:50.763 --> 39:54.934
No. I haven't really
been able to sleep.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.269
Me neither.

39:57.311 --> 40:01.190
I went to settle
your tab at the hotel.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.359
They said you left
some stuff in a drawer.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.075
Siobhan...

40:13.619 --> 40:15.413
are you pregnant?

40:17.373 --> 40:18.749
Yes.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.628
Is it mine?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.298
Yes.

40:35.224 --> 40:37.726
You OK?

40:37.768 --> 40:39.603
No.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.481
But I will be.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.775
One more look around.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.485
Make sure
we got everything.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.656
This is the last time

40:50.698 --> 40:52.575
I ever want to see
Charlie's apartment.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.704
What's that?

40:58.622 --> 40:59.999
I don't know.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.336
That's Charlie's
handwriting.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.921
What's "Pivoine"?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.011
I thought
with Charlie gone,

41:12.052 --> 41:15.222
I would stop
asking questions...

41:15.264 --> 41:16.974
but I can't.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.686
Why was he after Siobhan?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.941
Why Gemma?

41:25.983 --> 41:29.028
This can't just be
about money.

41:29.069 --> 41:31.405
There has to be more to it.

41:31.447 --> 41:35.409
