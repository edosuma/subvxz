00:03.890 --> 00:07.158
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
That spice rub smells amazing.

00:07.205 --> 00:10.040
Do you need any help basting?
I am an excellent baster.

00:10.074 --> 00:11.074
What are we rubbing down?

00:11.109 --> 00:13.310
- Me.
- Okay, no.

00:13.344 --> 00:16.312
Yep, Mom's back has been
hurting since last week

00:16.347 --> 00:18.548
when she tried to pick up a ham
but she won't go to the doctor

00:18.583 --> 00:20.884
because she's stubborn
and because, of course,

00:20.918 --> 00:22.986
there's nothing a
turmeric paste can't cure.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.222
This is the original Ben and Gay.

00:25.256 --> 00:27.057
Mom, listen, you smell
so delicious that I'd love

00:27.091 --> 00:28.425
to serve you over a bed of rice

00:28.459 --> 00:30.994
but I think you need to see a doctor.

00:31.028 --> 00:33.563
No! My friend Gurjinder
went to the doctor.

00:33.598 --> 00:34.765
Now she's dead.

00:34.799 --> 00:36.600
That's not why. Okay, Mom,

00:36.634 --> 00:39.136
I need you to go to the doctor
because I care about you,

00:39.170 --> 00:40.804
and because I need you
to take care of our kids.

00:40.838 --> 00:42.072
- Yeah.
- Mom's home!

00:42.106 --> 00:44.074
Mom, mom, mom, mom!

00:44.108 --> 00:45.976
<i>Aww, my babies.</i>

00:46.010 --> 00:47.844
<i>After working all day,
I look forward to this.</i>

00:47.879 --> 00:49.746
Mom, tell Louie that's my keychain.

00:49.781 --> 00:53.517
He needs to give it back to me.
He threw his away at Taco Bell.

00:53.551 --> 00:56.753
Those are false allegations;
this is my grizzly.

00:56.788 --> 00:58.522
It's chewed on one end, and I chewed it!

00:58.556 --> 01:01.425
Nobody needs a keychain
because neither of you owns any keys.

01:01.459 --> 01:03.660
That's not the point;
it's special to me.

01:03.694 --> 01:06.863
It's special to me!
Chewing it brings me comfort.

01:06.898 --> 01:09.766
Okay, we'll work on that...
Wait, no, Mom. No!

01:11.588 --> 01:12.602
Problem solved.

01:12.637 --> 01:16.773
Come Louie, take this and rub
it on my hard to reach places.

01:17.575 --> 01:22.045
<i>God, I can't believe I let
my mom take care of my kids.</i>

_

01:31.088 --> 01:32.722
<i>Getting my mom to go to the doctor</i>

01:32.757 --> 01:35.492
<i>was a lot like tricking a dog
into going to the vet.</i>

01:35.526 --> 01:37.227
<i>You gotta promise a treat
to get them in the car.</i>

01:37.261 --> 01:41.298
Oh, boy. I can't believe
I'm finally seeing "Hamilton."

01:41.332 --> 01:45.001
Nothing takes away pain like
a three hour hip-hop musical

01:45.036 --> 01:47.170
about a treasury secretary.

01:47.205 --> 01:50.807
Yeah, just got to get the tickets
from my friend Deb in her office.

01:50.842 --> 01:53.810
<i>Poor little buddy.
She has no idea what she's in for.</i>

01:53.845 --> 01:55.212
Are we there yet?

01:55.246 --> 01:58.915
Mom, I'm doing this for your own good.

01:58.950 --> 02:01.718
What? A doctor?

02:01.752 --> 02:03.320
I should have known this was a lie.

02:03.354 --> 02:04.554
You have no friends.

02:04.589 --> 02:07.824
- All right, come on. Come on.
- No!

02:07.859 --> 02:10.926
<i>So, my mom is confined
to bed rest in her house.</i>

02:10.961 --> 02:13.063
Okay, Mom,
you heard what the doctor said.

02:13.097 --> 02:15.932
You have a bulging disc.
You need to stay off your feet

02:15.967 --> 02:17.601
and rest so that you can heal.

02:17.635 --> 02:19.536
If Sonny is going to take care of me

02:19.570 --> 02:21.505
who is going to take
care of the children?

02:21.539 --> 02:24.174
Some stranger who will duct
tape the baby to the couch

02:24.208 --> 02:26.743
so she can go outside
and smoke a doobie pipe?

02:26.777 --> 02:29.880
Yes, Mom, I know
what you think about strangers

02:29.914 --> 02:31.348
taking care of the kids.

02:31.382 --> 02:33.250
That it's white people nonsense

02:33.284 --> 02:35.685
like sunscreen and
supporting public radio.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.187
You know, without our support,
National Public Radio

02:37.221 --> 02:38.555
would actually be in dire, dire...

02:38.589 --> 02:40.524
- It's not the time.
- I'll sit this one out.

02:40.558 --> 02:43.960
With family at least you know
they'll do best for the kids.

02:43.995 --> 02:45.929
Mom, you took the kids
to Gurjinder's funeral.

02:45.963 --> 02:48.431
Yes, I used it as a lesson.

02:48.466 --> 02:50.600
I said,
"She didn't finish her vegetables."

02:50.635 --> 02:52.035
Oh, my God, Mom.

02:52.069 --> 02:53.937
Please just focus
on getting better, okay?

02:53.971 --> 02:55.094
The kids will be fine.

02:55.139 --> 02:57.140
Yes. I will take some
work from home days.

02:57.174 --> 02:58.408
I will rearrange some commitments.

02:58.442 --> 03:00.243
It won't be easy, but we will manage.

03:00.278 --> 03:04.381
Oh, Googaloo, only you know
how to ease my pain.

03:04.415 --> 03:08.251
- Sing to me, Sweetie.
- For you, my love, anything.

03:10.588 --> 03:12.722
♪ Come and get your love, Baby ♪

03:12.757 --> 03:14.824
You know what?
We're gonna get out of here.

03:14.859 --> 03:17.894
- ♪ Come and get your love ♪
- Feel better.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.066
Guys, sorry I'm late.
This morning was stressful

03:23.100 --> 03:24.634
because my parents aren't around.

03:24.669 --> 03:28.238
Oh dear. So sudden.
It's just that there's nothing

03:28.272 --> 03:29.472
that can prepare you for this, is there?

03:29.507 --> 03:31.341
Chewey, do you seriously think

03:31.375 --> 03:33.910
that I would come into work
if my parents had just died?

03:33.945 --> 03:35.579
- Yes.
- The answer is no.

03:35.613 --> 03:37.914
My mom's back is out
and my dad is taking care of her.

03:37.949 --> 03:39.583
David couldn't even go into work.

03:39.617 --> 03:41.017
We're such a mess.

03:41.052 --> 03:43.653
Ah! I think I put coffee
in Louie's lunch box.

03:43.688 --> 03:46.089
Ugh, okay, well, we'll find out tonight.

03:46.123 --> 03:47.190
Why don't you just hire a nanny?

03:47.224 --> 03:48.592
You're a freaking millionaire.

03:48.626 --> 03:50.093
Okay, Griff, just because I'm your boss

03:50.127 --> 03:51.761
does not mean I'm a millionaire.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.331
Also, as much as I fantasized
about having a nanny

03:54.365 --> 03:55.832
my mom would freak out,
and she'd be right to.

03:55.866 --> 03:57.334
I mean, those are my babies.

03:57.368 --> 03:59.469
If Jake was in danger
do you think a stranger

03:59.503 --> 04:01.137
would throw down their life for him?

04:01.172 --> 04:02.806
Well, actually,
I can answer that question

04:02.840 --> 04:05.108
as I've had many nannies,
but I'll never forget about Tabitha

04:05.142 --> 04:08.044
who risked it all to scoop
me up at a polo match

04:08.079 --> 04:10.280
when a stampede broke
out on our property.

04:10.314 --> 04:11.548
Wait, you've had a lot of nannies?

04:11.582 --> 04:13.450
Wait, you grew up on a property?

04:13.484 --> 04:17.853
Just a small farm with a
small castle and polo grounds.

04:17.887 --> 04:19.154
Chewey, are you, like, royalty?

04:19.190 --> 04:22.125
No, don't be silly. No.

04:22.159 --> 04:24.661
No, nobility.
Yeah, the correct title is baron,

04:24.695 --> 04:26.950
which is just a lord
who owns land, basically.

04:26.985 --> 04:28.231
And you never mentioned this, why?

04:28.265 --> 04:31.334
Well, it's very unbecoming of
a lord to mention he's a lord.

04:31.369 --> 04:32.669
It's like if you went to Oxford.

04:32.703 --> 04:35.538
You wouldn't walk around
telling everyone, "I went to Oxford."

04:35.573 --> 04:37.474
- Did you go to Oxford?
- Yes.

04:37.508 --> 04:40.644
So, how do we get ahead of this scandal
in the skies, David?

04:40.678 --> 04:43.380
Well, Dennis,
the press is going to spin this

04:43.414 --> 04:45.515
like we kicked a breastfeeding
mother off an airplane,

04:45.549 --> 04:48.018
because that is in fact what we did.

04:48.364 --> 04:50.053
So I think it's... whoops...

04:50.087 --> 04:52.922
I think it's really important that...
that we let people know

04:52.957 --> 04:57.027
that we have the second lowest
breastfeeding mom kickoff rate

04:57.061 --> 04:59.696
of any domestic airline, umm...

04:59.730 --> 05:01.431
What are you doing? Dad's doing work.

05:01.465 --> 05:03.166
I'm going viral, momma.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.101
Uh, David, is this not a good time?

05:05.136 --> 05:06.503
No, this is a great time, Dennis. Umm...

05:06.537 --> 05:07.604
Dennis?

05:07.638 --> 05:11.641
Is that that bald turd
you're always talking about?

05:16.881 --> 05:18.515
- Ems. Ems.
- No, babe. What?

05:18.549 --> 05:20.216
Uh, little bit
of a Skype problem at home.

05:20.251 --> 05:21.718
I need to go into the office.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.253
So, can you take the kids
for the afternoon?

05:23.287 --> 05:24.854
- Yes?
- No, no, no, David.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.390
- This is not a daycare.
- Emet. Emet, watch.

05:27.425 --> 05:29.092
I'm gonna do it.
Emet, Emet, check it out. Ready?

05:29.126 --> 05:32.195
Yeah, no, for children.
It's not a daycare for children.

05:32.229 --> 05:35.298
Okay, I tried working from home.
It wasn't productive, so,

05:35.332 --> 05:37.200
we can't keep our jobs without help.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.569
So either Lily is the mom now,
or we hire someone.

05:39.603 --> 05:41.071
You guys shouldn't be so worried.

05:41.105 --> 05:42.439
Okay, having a nanny isn't all bad.

05:42.473 --> 05:44.641
I mean, sure, some of mine were cruel,

05:44.675 --> 05:46.876
and some of them were kind,
but one thing's for certain:

05:46.911 --> 05:51.047
♪ A boy who makes his bed
is a very clever lad ♪

05:51.082 --> 05:54.718
♪ and a very clever lad
doesn't need his dad ♪

05:56.087 --> 05:59.055
It's like Mary Poppins but depressing.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.924
Yeah, it's something.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.225
Okay, fine. David, you're right.

06:02.259 --> 06:03.660
Maybe we should just do it.

06:03.694 --> 06:06.096
We'll hire a nanny
until my mom gets back.

06:06.130 --> 06:07.097
All right, what should we tell your mom?

06:07.131 --> 06:08.565
Are you crazy? Nothing.

06:08.599 --> 06:10.266
If I can hide dating
a white guy for a year

06:10.301 --> 06:12.569
I can certainly hide a
nanny for a few weeks.

06:12.603 --> 06:14.270
Check out my big red ball. Watch!

06:14.305 --> 06:16.072
Okay, you know what?
Just ignore. Ignore him.

06:16.107 --> 06:19.142
- Do not talk to him, ever. Ever.
- Side by side.

06:20.665 --> 06:23.954
Okay, what if the nanny is
a sociopath or a meth addict

06:23.989 --> 06:26.023
or has a weird sized eye
that I can't stop looking at,

06:26.057 --> 06:27.791
and then she senses that
it's making me uncomfortable

06:27.826 --> 06:29.126
and she takes it out on the kids?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.962
On paper this woman is more qualified
to raise our children than we are.

06:32.831 --> 06:34.198
Oh, I like her knock.

06:34.232 --> 06:37.001
Mm-hmm. Knock says a lot about a person.

06:37.035 --> 06:40.804
Just a sec. Nice to meet you.
Come on in.

06:40.839 --> 06:42.006
- Hi.
- Hi!

06:42.040 --> 06:43.640
- I'm Anna Mae.
- Yes, hello.

06:43.675 --> 06:46.143
Hello, Mommy.
And this must be my friend, Jake.

06:46.177 --> 06:49.046
Now you come to me,
little smoosh muffin.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.048
Just don't be offended
because he does sometimes

06:51.082 --> 06:53.350
take a minute to just
warm up to strangers and...

06:54.686 --> 06:56.720
He's just fine. Wow.

06:56.755 --> 07:00.657
Little trick... I just dab
some banana behind each ear.

07:00.692 --> 07:03.327
Kids love it.
Unfortunately, so do fruit flies.

07:03.361 --> 07:05.729
- Sure.
- Oh, there's one.

07:05.764 --> 07:07.398
Louie, give me back my hair tie!

07:07.432 --> 07:08.866
Guys, cut it out!

07:08.900 --> 07:09.967
Louie!

07:10.001 --> 07:11.668
- It's my hair tie!
- I need it!

07:11.703 --> 07:13.570
Is that what I think it is, young man?

07:13.605 --> 07:15.739
Wow, I have heard of those

07:15.774 --> 07:17.641
but I can't believe
you actually have one.

07:17.675 --> 07:20.544
This is not a hair tie or a weapon.

07:20.578 --> 07:24.181
This is a magical sibling bonding band.

07:24.215 --> 07:28.085
Hurry up! Show me your wrist
before it loses its power.

07:28.119 --> 07:30.187
Wow. I feel it.

07:30.221 --> 07:32.156
- Oh, this bitch is good.
- Yeah, that is the real deal.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.424
Who are you?

07:33.458 --> 07:37.828
Yeah, uh, guys, this is Anna Mae
and she's your new nanny.

07:37.862 --> 07:39.329
'Cause she's magic.

07:39.364 --> 07:42.166
So, what do we want for dinner?
Chicken pot pie?

07:42.200 --> 07:45.602
Are you more of a crusty bottom
or like a biscuit top guy?

07:45.637 --> 07:48.672
- Well...
- Wait. Both?

07:48.706 --> 07:50.374
Can you love two women at once?

07:50.408 --> 07:52.176
Yes.

07:54.045 --> 07:55.546
Uh, me and Griff have been talking

07:55.580 --> 07:57.081
and we want to come to your castle.

07:57.115 --> 07:58.682
Yes. You've taken dumps
at both of our apartments

07:58.716 --> 08:00.184
so it's only fair.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.752
And I know black people are allowed now

08:01.786 --> 08:03.420
because Duchess Meghan
kicked down the door.

08:03.455 --> 08:05.289
Hi guys, good morning.

08:05.323 --> 08:08.459
Anna Mae made muffins.
This woman is amazing.

08:08.493 --> 08:11.528
I mean, she cooks, she cleans,
she tricks the kids.

08:11.563 --> 08:13.864
This is exactly what I dreamed
parenting would be like.

08:13.898 --> 08:15.899
I don't suppose there's
any freshly churned butter

08:15.934 --> 08:17.134
to go with them, is there?

08:17.168 --> 08:18.035
No.

08:18.069 --> 08:20.537
Well, she's no nanny Tabitha, then.

08:21.773 --> 08:24.575
Oh, no, no, no, this is terrible.

08:24.609 --> 08:26.310
My mom is gonna be fine.

08:26.344 --> 08:28.145
She's gonna be back on
her feet in a few days.

08:28.179 --> 08:29.079
Damn.

08:29.114 --> 08:30.614
I pray every night that
my mom stay healthy

08:30.648 --> 08:32.082
but that's just me, I guess.

08:32.116 --> 08:35.652
That is just you, okay?
I want her to be healthy.

08:35.687 --> 08:37.821
I just don't want her to be able to walk
or get up for a little while.

08:37.856 --> 08:39.389
Is that so wrong?

08:39.424 --> 08:42.426
<i>Anna Mae is like if
Xanax became a person.</i>

08:42.460 --> 08:44.661
<i>And David and I needed
to make this prescription</i>

08:44.696 --> 08:46.330
<i>last as long as possible.</i>

08:46.364 --> 08:48.165
<i>I just had to hope David could lie.</i>

08:48.199 --> 08:50.067
The kids send their love.
They're with Trina.

08:50.101 --> 08:51.602
You don't know her but she exists.

08:51.636 --> 08:53.303
She's a third cousin of mine. Family.

08:53.338 --> 08:55.672
It's only temporary. How are you doing?

08:55.707 --> 08:57.274
I miss my grandkids.

08:57.308 --> 08:59.443
Hey, no sitting. That's the fancy chair.

08:59.477 --> 09:01.445
- What are you doing?
- I forgot family stands.

09:01.479 --> 09:03.480
Oh, Mom, we are just so glad
that you're feeling

09:03.515 --> 09:06.116
so much better but you should
take your time, you know?

09:06.151 --> 09:08.018
I mean, we wouldn't want you to
come back before you're ready.

09:08.052 --> 09:09.586
You could reinjure yourself.

09:09.621 --> 09:11.188
You could be gone for, like, six months.

09:11.222 --> 09:15.025
What nonsense.
When I was a girl I won the jump rope

09:15.059 --> 09:17.654
competition while I was
burning with malaria.

09:17.689 --> 09:18.662
I'm a strong woman.

09:18.696 --> 09:20.297
Oh, she's right.
Quick, throw a wooden block

09:20.331 --> 09:21.865
at her feet and hobble her.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.034
Maya, the kids,
they miss you but they are fine.

09:24.068 --> 09:26.036
I'm working from home, kinda.

09:26.070 --> 09:28.138
You should take your time and get well.

09:28.173 --> 09:31.189
Yeah, perhaps I should stay
off my feet a bit longer.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.276
You definitely should, Mom.

09:32.310 --> 09:36.380
Oh, Sonny! It's both too hot
and too cold in this room.

09:36.928 --> 09:38.115
Of course, my love,

09:38.149 --> 09:41.318
I shall both raise and lower
the thermostat per your needs.

09:41.352 --> 09:44.454
Okay, we're gonna go,
but you rest and be warm and cold.

09:44.489 --> 09:45.622
- Okay.
- Psst.

09:45.657 --> 09:46.890
What? What? Hi, Dad.

09:46.925 --> 09:47.991
I knew you two were up to something.

09:48.026 --> 09:49.726
I need you to stop.

09:49.761 --> 09:51.795
Very concerned about my mother-in...

09:51.829 --> 09:54.831
I love her, but I need my life back.

09:54.866 --> 10:00.204
Sonny, I'm craving Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

10:00.238 --> 10:02.339
Postmates. Okay, come on.

10:02.373 --> 10:03.840
I'm gonna kick your butt, Lily!

10:03.875 --> 10:05.509
I'm gonna kick your butt!

10:05.543 --> 10:07.144
Well, we knew that was too good to last.

10:07.178 --> 10:10.847
- Yup.
- Three. Two. One. Hands up.

10:10.882 --> 10:13.350
And the folding champion is...

10:13.384 --> 10:15.519
both of you for doing
your personal best.

10:15.553 --> 10:18.422
Yes! I love the way we smell.

10:18.456 --> 10:20.224
Mountain fresh!

10:21.359 --> 10:23.927
My God,
is she turning chores into games?

10:23.962 --> 10:26.029
Remember my mom,
she turns games into chores.

10:26.064 --> 10:27.664
You remember when we
played checkers with her?

10:27.699 --> 10:28.865
Oh, my God that was hell.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.234
Can I ask you guys a quick favor?

10:30.268 --> 10:31.301
Sure.

10:31.336 --> 10:33.337
Do you mind if I stay
a little later tonight?

10:33.371 --> 10:35.339
I don't think she knows how favors work.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.909
Well, it's just Jake's asleep
and Lil and Lou are easy-peasy,

10:38.943 --> 10:41.545
and you guys have a sick cable package.

10:41.579 --> 10:43.680
Plus, I thought maybe you
could use a night out together?

10:43.715 --> 10:47.517
- We couldn't do that.
- You've been working all day.

10:47.552 --> 10:49.386
- But what's a few more hours?
- If you insist, though.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.754
I insist.

10:51.089 --> 10:52.356
What?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

10:52.390 --> 10:53.790
Buca Di Beppo's?

10:53.825 --> 10:55.892
Yes, but also,
if we hired her permanently

10:55.927 --> 10:57.394
we could live like this all the time.

10:57.428 --> 10:59.062
We could have a healthy, stable home

10:59.097 --> 11:01.732
and we could get our pictures
on the wall at the Buc.

11:01.766 --> 11:04.901
The only problem is once
my mom's back gets better

11:04.936 --> 11:06.403
we'd have to break her heart.

11:06.437 --> 11:08.138
Yeah... we would.

11:08.172 --> 11:09.853
You know what? Tomorrow thoughts.

11:10.008 --> 11:11.656
Let's go carbo load.

11:14.112 --> 11:15.812
<i>After the greatest
night's sleep I've had</i>

11:15.847 --> 11:19.650
<i>since I accidentally mistook a Valium
for an allergy pill, I felt less guilty</i>

11:19.684 --> 11:21.251
<i>about kicking my mom to the curb.</i>

11:21.286 --> 11:23.787
<i>I mean, look at this kitchen.
It's so clean,</i>

11:23.821 --> 11:25.722
<i>you'd never even know I had kids.</i>

11:25.757 --> 11:27.758
<i>That's the dream, people.</i>

11:27.792 --> 11:29.326
- Good morning, Emet.
- Good morning.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.927
The kids will be ready
for school shortly.

11:30.962 --> 11:32.929
Ah, amazing. God, it is just so nice

11:32.964 --> 11:34.298
to have a breather in the morning,
you know?

11:34.332 --> 11:36.099
- Yeah.
- Just, usually I'm scrambling

11:36.134 --> 11:38.101
to get the kids ready for
school and Louie's homework

11:38.136 --> 11:40.270
ready and here it is just
done and ready to go.

11:40.305 --> 11:42.606
Well, you should read Louie's story.

11:42.640 --> 11:49.246
Such imagination.
Hyperbole aside, his mind is boundless.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.481
- My Louie?
- Okay, I'm gonna go sanitize

11:51.516 --> 11:53.116
the baby's humidifier.

11:53.151 --> 11:57.287
Thank you. You do that and
I'm just gonna sit right here.

11:57.322 --> 11:59.423
All right, let's see this story.

11:59.457 --> 12:03.293
"The Magical Fairy who Saved the Boy"
by Louie Sweetzer.

12:03.328 --> 12:04.695
This is cute.

12:04.729 --> 12:07.931
<i>"Once upon a time there was
a little prince whose mommy,</i>

12:07.965 --> 12:09.599
<i>"the queen, was busy all the time.</i>

12:09.634 --> 12:12.436
<i>"Too busy to make the
boy carne asada tacos</i>

12:12.470 --> 12:15.106
<i>"even though a lot of families
have taco Tuesday.</i>

12:15.507 --> 12:18.642
<i>"The fairy was fun and
cool and not busy at all,</i>

12:18.676 --> 12:20.510
<i>"so, he asked her
to put a spell on his mom</i>

12:20.545 --> 12:22.779
<i>"so she wouldn't remember
he'd been born.</i>

12:22.814 --> 12:25.615
<i>Then the boy could live
with the fairy forever."</i>

12:26.160 --> 12:29.119
<i>Seriously, Louie? You think
the nanny's better than me?</i>

12:31.489 --> 12:32.956
Oh, gosh.

12:32.990 --> 12:34.958
<i>I'm gonna need her to iron that.</i>

12:40.608 --> 12:42.528
Okay, okay, okay guys.
Just talk me off the ledge.

12:42.563 --> 12:44.656
Sure. Emet, you don't look forty.

12:44.691 --> 12:46.375
Not that ledge, but, thank you.

12:46.410 --> 12:48.604
Does Louie's story mean that the kids
like the nanny better than me?

12:48.636 --> 12:51.404
No way, Lily and Louie have,
like, a special bond with you.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.339
- You're their mom.
- Thank you, Griff.

12:53.374 --> 12:54.607
The baby on the other hand...

12:54.642 --> 12:56.009
You guys basically just met.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.577
So every day that goes by,

12:57.611 --> 13:01.848
she becomes more his mom than you are.
You guys craving tacos?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.383
Oh, God, that's my actual nightmare.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.952
Okay, but if David's happy
and the kids are happy

13:05.986 --> 13:07.453
then do I even really get to admit

13:07.488 --> 13:09.455
that I'm too insecure
to let them be happy?

13:09.490 --> 13:12.592
Good golly, I need a vacation from this.

13:12.626 --> 13:16.629
Which is why we're all
going to jolly old England.

13:16.664 --> 13:19.465
Yep, mum says you're all invited
to use this castle for tea.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.900
Yes!

13:20.934 --> 13:23.202
I can't go to England.
I'm losing my family.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.470
Just bring them with you!

13:24.505 --> 13:26.239
Anyway, I've organized everything, okay?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.408
So, between the airfare,
ground transportation,

13:28.442 --> 13:29.742
and our share of the staff salaries,

13:29.777 --> 13:31.544
it comes to ã5,000 each.

13:31.578 --> 13:35.048
Venmo me. I'm chuffed!

13:35.082 --> 13:36.582
We're not [bleep] doing that, right?

13:36.617 --> 13:38.251
<i>Maybe I'm overreacting.</i>

13:38.285 --> 13:41.788
<i>After all, I'm not used to the kids
spending time with anyone new.</i>

13:41.822 --> 13:44.057
<i>It's fine. I'm good. I'm fine.</i>

13:44.091 --> 13:46.659
<i>I know my kids love me
more than anything.</i>

13:46.694 --> 13:48.327
- Mommy's home.
- Yay!

13:48.362 --> 13:49.095
Aww, already?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.997
Does Anna Mae have to go home?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.766
Please stay. We love you.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.903
<i>Yeah, that's it.
This bitch has got to go.</i>

13:57.671 --> 14:00.273
You know, babe,
as much as we love Anna Mae...

14:00.307 --> 14:02.842
Oh, my gosh do we love her.
I mean, a blessing on her head.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.244
Mazel Tov. Mazel Tov.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.581
Yeah, but you know,
maybe family is best.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.982
- Hmm?
- I mean, at least we can trust

14:10.017 --> 14:11.451
my mom, you know?

14:11.485 --> 14:13.319
'Cause I just read this
article about this nanny

14:13.353 --> 14:16.022
who turned out to be in a cult
and brainwashed the kids...

14:16.056 --> 14:17.857
Oh, yeah. Wash those brains right out.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.092
Scrub a dub dub 'em.

14:19.688 --> 14:21.928
- Our family's never been happier.
- Yeah.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.696
<i>Dammit. David's not biting.</i>

14:23.731 --> 14:25.298
<i>If I'm gonna get rid of Anna Mae
she'll have to give me</i>

14:25.332 --> 14:27.300
<i>a reason to send her packing.</i>

14:27.334 --> 14:30.503
Hey, Anna Mae.
Listen, um, I know you asked

14:30.537 --> 14:33.272
to go to your brother's wedding but,
um, I'm getting a massage

14:33.307 --> 14:35.708
that day so it's a hard no.

14:35.743 --> 14:38.845
Well, I don't know how
to say this nicely but...

14:38.879 --> 14:40.713
Quit, quit, quit, quit, quit.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.115
- Thank you!
- What?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.217
Ah! I did not want
to go to that wedding.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.120
- Oh.
- Toby is a toxic personality.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.721
- Oh.
- And it's in Tucson.

14:48.756 --> 14:50.189
- No thank you.
- Yeah.

14:50.224 --> 14:52.391
- Okay. Well I'm here for you.
- Thank you.

14:52.426 --> 14:54.560
Okay. So good.

14:54.595 --> 14:59.031
<i>I knew what I had to do:
frame the nanny for a felony.</i>

14:59.066 --> 15:02.969
<i>Okay, even for me that's a low.
I can't, I can't...</i>

15:03.003 --> 15:05.238
Oh, let me get that out of your way.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.207
Oh! Louie's iPad?

15:08.242 --> 15:09.642
How did that get in my bag?

15:09.956 --> 15:12.078
I was wondering the same thing.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.381
It was me. I did it.
I put the iPad in the bag.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.883
I don't think that's what happened.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.252
It is what happened. I saw.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.988
I wanted to give Anna Mae
a present for being the best.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.489
Aww, Louie.

15:23.524 --> 15:25.525
That's very sweet but
I couldn't accept that.

15:25.559 --> 15:29.228
You know what I do take? Hugs.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.264
- Come here.
- Get her. Get her good.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.066
<i>God, they're protecting her.
My nanny's not a thief</i>

15:34.101 --> 15:35.668
<i>but my kids are frickin' liars.</i>

15:35.702 --> 15:39.071
<i>I need something big. I will break her.</i>

15:41.141 --> 15:43.442
Googaloo, shall we have a baby?

15:43.477 --> 15:46.612
Hmm? I knew I should have
cut those pain pills in half.

15:46.647 --> 15:49.715
There was a 72 year
old in India who stuck

15:49.750 --> 15:52.714
some other woman's eggs
inside her and plopped out a baby.

15:52.749 --> 15:53.586
Why can't I?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.455
Okay, look.
I know you miss the grandchildren

15:56.490 --> 15:58.457
but you'll get better soon.
Just be patient.

15:58.492 --> 16:02.428
You're right, Googaloo.
I miss my grandkids so much.

16:02.462 --> 16:07.800
Can you get me a pillow
that's as firm as it is soft?

16:09.670 --> 16:11.938
<i>If I was going to get this
loveable leech out of the way</i>

16:11.972 --> 16:13.706
<i>I needed David on my side.</i>

16:13.740 --> 16:17.310
<i>I was gonna hit him where it hurts...
his vintage guitar,</i>

16:17.344 --> 16:19.312
<i>which he named Butter.</i>

16:19.346 --> 16:20.780
Sorry, Butter.

16:22.583 --> 16:26.552
I'm so sorry.
I took my eyes off Jake for a second.

16:26.587 --> 16:30.389
He must have found a way
to reach and unscrew the cap

16:30.424 --> 16:32.458
to the paint and then
he got it on his fingers

16:32.492 --> 16:34.460
and got it all over the guitar

16:34.494 --> 16:37.720
without getting a drop
anywhere else, somehow?

16:37.755 --> 16:40.266
Okay, you know what, the details
actually don't really matter.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.969
What concerns me more
than the very, very, very

16:43.003 --> 16:44.337
special guitar that you ruined

16:44.371 --> 16:47.273
is why were you not watching our child?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.743
I mean, this says toxic if swallowed.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.778
<i>Okay, the baby didn't touch toxic paint.</i>

16:52.813 --> 16:54.180
<i>I switched them out.</i>

16:54.214 --> 16:56.682
You know,
he could have gotten into pills,

16:56.717 --> 16:58.184
rat poison, bath salts.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.785
I mean, this is serious, Anna Mae.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.320
Can you just please explain to us

17:01.355 --> 17:04.022
what you could have possibly been doing

17:04.057 --> 17:06.525
that made you leave our baby alone?

17:06.560 --> 17:10.630
I was on my phone but I was
making Bitmojis of the kids.

17:10.664 --> 17:12.198
Okay, don't know what that means.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.666
- Super fun cartoon.
- Wow.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.337
I can't believe I'm saying
this but we have to let you go.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.173
I understand. I'll get my things.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.377
<i>Who did that? Emet did that.</i>

17:25.412 --> 17:27.480
Okay, honey, look.
I know that that was hard,

17:27.513 --> 17:28.948
but you did the right thing.

17:28.982 --> 17:32.385
- You really did.
- Yeah. I'm gonna miss her.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.520
Okay, but the good news is
my mom will be back soon.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.023
It's just so weird.
She was so good with the kids.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.960
She was so, so, so attentive.
Why are your nail beds blue?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.228
Oh, you know what?

17:42.262 --> 17:43.329
That's the new Kylie Jenner nail polish.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.563
It's supposed to look stupid.

17:44.598 --> 17:45.998
God, I caught you blue handed.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.911
You... you set that woman up?

17:47.946 --> 17:49.769
Look, David, she just wasn't
the right fit for us, okay?

17:49.804 --> 17:52.171
- That's just... I'm being honest.
- That's not what you said the other day

17:52.205 --> 17:55.074
when you said we should ask
her to replace your mother.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.379
Oh, no. So how long have you been there?

18:00.414 --> 18:02.248
Long enough, man.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.750
I was stopping by to
show you that I'm better.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.087
I was going to do one of
those dramatic moments

18:08.121 --> 18:12.892
where I look hopeless but then
I get up from my chair and walk.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.594
Okay, well, we're really
glad that you're better, Mom.

18:15.629 --> 18:19.031
My back was better until
you stabbed me in it.

18:19.066 --> 18:21.934
You two are dishonest and ungrateful

18:21.969 --> 18:23.502
and you have hurt me deeply.

18:23.537 --> 18:26.172
So I quit. I'm not going to
look after your children.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.606
Good luck.

18:27.641 --> 18:31.010
Okay, Emet did this and they're
my kids too so this seems unfair.

18:31.044 --> 18:32.745
Wow, you're here, too. Great.

18:32.779 --> 18:37.216
Okie-dokie. Good to see you. Love you.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.186
My life is over.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.487
I think we should talk.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.000
Oh, God. My mom's
never gonna forgive me.

18:45.026 --> 18:46.232
I mean, I don't know
if you picked up on this...

18:46.295 --> 18:47.758
she holds grudges
tighter than a handbag.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.036
Oh, your mom? I mean,
I don't know if I'm gonna forgive you.

18:50.099 --> 18:51.944
You chased away Anna Mae...

18:52.033 --> 18:54.071
the best thing that ever happened to us.

18:54.168 --> 18:56.202
Honey, you read Louie's story, okay?

18:56.236 --> 18:58.071
I... I thought I was replacing my mom.

18:58.105 --> 18:59.372
I didn't want to replace myself.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.207
Sweetie, it's just a story.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.443
Yeah, it's a story of my life.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.718
Look, my time with the kids
is already cut in half

19:05.753 --> 19:06.756
because of work, okay?

19:06.791 --> 19:07.847
And I love my job. I do.

19:07.881 --> 19:10.450
I just feel a little guilty
sometimes but at least

19:10.484 --> 19:13.286
I get to come home and see
their excited faces saying,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.354
"Yay, Mommy's home!"

19:15.389 --> 19:17.690
I wanted to be the magic fairy.

19:17.725 --> 19:19.759
You're their mother.
You'll always be their magic fairy

19:19.793 --> 19:22.128
but you are a magic fairy
with a full time job

19:22.162 --> 19:23.696
and so am I and we have to get real.

19:23.731 --> 19:26.365
Because of your jealousy,
you pushed away someone

19:26.400 --> 19:28.568
who made our family happier.

19:28.602 --> 19:32.371
- And you pushed away pot pie.
- You're right.

19:32.406 --> 19:33.806
We gotta get her back.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.944
<i>When you let the greatest thing</i>

19:37.978 --> 19:40.546
<i>that's ever happened to you
walk out of your life,</i>

19:40.581 --> 19:42.548
- <i>there's only one thing to do.</i>
- _

19:42.583 --> 19:44.450
<i>Dump your kids at a play
date and get her back.</i>

19:48.522 --> 19:50.123
<i>I just hope it wasn't too late.</i>

19:55.295 --> 19:57.897
Hi. Look, I know what I did
was wrong. I do.

19:57.931 --> 20:00.733
And even more than that,
I realize you don't know how much

20:00.768 --> 20:02.502
you need someone until you lose them.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.771
What Emet is trying to say is,

20:04.805 --> 20:07.640
we need you. Yes. You.

20:08.609 --> 20:11.010
Not a stranger that acts like family

20:11.044 --> 20:14.747
but family that acts strange.

20:14.782 --> 20:16.315
Hold that.

20:16.350 --> 20:18.251
I'm just a girl standing
in front of her mother,

20:18.285 --> 20:19.418
asking her to forgive her,

20:19.453 --> 20:21.921
and watch her children for free.

20:21.955 --> 20:24.357
You had me at you made a giant mistake,

20:24.391 --> 20:27.827
and I'm always right
because family is best.

20:27.861 --> 20:31.364
Mom, I know now
how it feels to be replaced.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.866
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you.

20:33.901 --> 20:36.536
<i>Also, we tried to get Anna Mae back,
but she was pissed</i>

20:36.570 --> 20:38.271
<i>and wanted an extra $500 a month</i>

20:38.305 --> 20:39.855
<i>and that meant Jake
couldn't go to college.</i>

20:39.890 --> 20:40.706
<i>So, here we are.</i>

20:40.741 --> 20:43.876
You're right, Maya. Family is best.

20:43.911 --> 20:44.877
<i>'Cause it's free.</i>

20:44.912 --> 20:46.212
Okie-dokie.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.848
I'm going to take a little nap now.

20:48.882 --> 20:51.150
Wake me in three days.

20:53.921 --> 20:56.122
Clear your plates, kids,
and put them on the island

20:56.156 --> 20:57.490
for your mom to wash.

20:57.524 --> 21:01.494
Grandma, can you make it into a game
like how Anna Mae used to?

21:01.528 --> 21:04.163
What do I look like?
Buster's Dave Arcade?

21:04.198 --> 21:05.998
Just do it. Emet?

21:06.033 --> 21:07.300
- Yeah?
- Where's the saffron?

21:07.334 --> 21:10.536
I need to slather some on my psoriasis.

21:10.571 --> 21:12.471
And it was all just a dream.

21:12.506 --> 21:14.674
- Stop following me, Louie.
- I'm not following you!

21:14.708 --> 21:16.309
Where do you keep your saffron?

21:16.343 --> 21:19.145
Everything's back to normal. Happy days.

21:19.179 --> 21:21.481
You stop it now or I'll
throw cold water on you.
