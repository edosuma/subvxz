(tranquil music playing)

01:23.967 --> 01:25.500
Well, I'm off.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.667
That would be
my diagnosis.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.300
No. I mean
I'm going out.

01:31.367 --> 01:33.300
Ma, put down
the binoculars.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.734
No. I need them.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.767
I lost my glasses.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.600
I'm not supposed
to drive without them.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.834
Let's analyze this.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.066
You're now, what,
about 200 years old?

01:44.133 --> 01:45.533
About.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.600
You have no license.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.667
You're not
allowed to drive.

01:50.734 --> 01:52.600
Curses!

01:54.066 --> 01:58.166
Dorothy, help me go through
these papers I sent for.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.967
They're to authenticate
my family tree.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.967
Tomorrow I'm presenting it

02:03.033 --> 02:05.367
at the Daughters of the Old South
initiation banquet.

02:05.433 --> 02:08.100
Blanche, you're not really going
through with this?

02:08.166 --> 02:09.433
Well, indeed I am.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.567
This club is a link

02:10.633 --> 02:13.133
to the proudest of all heritages.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.800
Growing up in Atlanta,

02:14.867 --> 02:17.567
us girls used to pretend to be
confederate belles

02:17.633 --> 02:19.500
and we'd received
gentleman callers.

02:19.567 --> 02:20.967
Got to be like a competition.

02:21.033 --> 02:24.100
I once received
seven callers in one evening.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.600
I'm just thinking out loud,

02:27.667 --> 02:32.433
but isn't Atlanta where the center
for disease control is?

02:35.734 --> 02:37.867
Coincidence.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.667
Hey, these are all right.

02:39.734 --> 02:42.633
When I look through them backwards,
you actually look demure.

02:43.867 --> 02:47.266
Ma, get new glasses, all right?

02:47.333 --> 02:48.166
(doorbell rings)

02:48.233 --> 02:51.066
You always make a big deal
out of everything.

02:51.133 --> 02:54.066
I'm not making a big deal out of it.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.467
Hi, Barbara.

02:55.533 --> 02:58.600
The police station got a call
about some lost glasses.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.133
How many men you got on this?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.633
Well, none, really.

03:02.700 --> 03:03.900
I checked the station.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.934
Nobody reported any lost glasses.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.800
Not lost, stolen.

03:07.867 --> 03:09.100
I want cops on this.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.233
Big, burly, steroid-crazed cops.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.767
Sophia.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.734
Oh. Fine. Get one for Blanche, too.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.100
Throw it on my tab.

03:24.233 --> 03:27.567
There's been some complaints
from the neighbors

03:27.633 --> 03:28.967
about the noise at night.

03:29.033 --> 03:29.967
Which neighbors?

03:30.033 --> 03:32.033
Well, me.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.300
Which noise?

03:33.367 --> 03:34.500
Well, you.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.033
Well, get earmuffs.
I pay my taxes.

03:42.734 --> 03:44.066
Ah, Rose.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.266
Another date with Karl tonight.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.000
You must really like him.

03:48.066 --> 03:49.300
I do.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.266
Karl is sweet, and he's supportive.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.800
He understands
I still have feelings for Miles.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.333
Rose.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.000
Miles is in the witness
relocation program.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.266
Don't tell people about him.

04:00.333 --> 04:04.200
I didn't tell him Miles ratted on a
gangster named the Cheeseman.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.734
He just knows there's somebody
I can't see anymore.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.200
Karl's quite a guy.

04:10.266 --> 04:13.667
I dream about him at night. Not Miles.

04:13.734 --> 04:18.567
Although I do have one dream
that both Karl and Miles are in.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.967
Ooh.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.166
And?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.767
Okay.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.867
And Captain Kangaroo.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.867
Oh, look here, Dorothy,

04:38.934 --> 04:41.433
this is my grandmother
Marcel Davaval.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.734
Pure southern through and through.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.533
Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry,
I just don't like

04:45.600 --> 04:47.100
the idea of this club.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.934
I mean, it seems so discriminatory.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.133
Dorothy, there is nothing wrong
with being proud

04:52.200 --> 04:53.600
of what you are.

04:53.667 --> 04:54.934
This club celebrates

04:55.000 --> 04:58.600
those individuals who can prove
they come from 100 percent

04:58.667 --> 05:00.300
southern confederate stock.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.667
And if you can't then
fiddle-di-doo to you.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.800
Do you have any idea
how much that hurts?

05:18.834 --> 05:22.033
Ladies and gentlemen,
Roy Orbison.

05:27.967 --> 05:30.133
Ma, where did you
get those glasses?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.533
They're pop's.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.633
But at least they've got
prescription lenses.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.567
You can't see through them.

05:35.633 --> 05:37.500
Now, take them off
before you hurt yourself.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.633
No. They're great.
I see just fine.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.367
Who's the black guy?

05:47.834 --> 05:50.033
I'm about done with this side
of the family tree.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.100
You have the papers from
the roquet marriage.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.700
Oh. Yeah. Wait.

05:53.767 --> 05:55.934
Oh, yeah. Here.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.367
Uh, "Walker Roquet married
Rosalyn Roquet, 1861.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.066
Rosalyn was from--"

06:02.133 --> 06:03.600
Uh-oh.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.533
What?

06:04.600 --> 06:07.133
Well, I hate telling you this.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.367
No, that's not true.

06:08.433 --> 06:11.500
I look forward to telling you this.

06:11.567 --> 06:13.967
The woman your
great-grandfather married

06:14.033 --> 06:18.767
was born, well, outside of Georgia.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.133
How far outside of Georgia?

06:21.700 --> 06:23.166
Buffalo.

06:26.266 --> 06:28.033
You're a Yankee, Blanche.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.166
No. This can't be.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.633
A Yankee doodle.

06:32.667 --> 06:33.834
There must be some mistake.

06:33.900 --> 06:37.300
You are that Yankee doodle gal.

06:37.367 --> 06:41.667
I want to see for myself
that my great-grandmother

06:41.734 --> 06:43.567
was that thing you said.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.100
-A Yankee.
-Right.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.500
A Yankee doodle.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.166
Oh, stop it.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.233
Oh, my God.

06:51.300 --> 06:55.500
Oh, did I mention
her last name was Feldman?

07:00.367 --> 07:02.500
Oh, no.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.333
I can't be Jewish.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.166
I'll be damned.

07:08.233 --> 07:10.433
The black guy is prejudiced.

07:17.266 --> 07:19.500
This information will have no bearing

07:19.567 --> 07:21.100
on my getting into that club.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.100
I'll just lie.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.467
This is ridiculous.

07:23.533 --> 07:26.667
Why lie? You're only 1/8 Yankee.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.867
That's right. I'm 7/8 southern.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.266
That's more than enough.

07:30.333 --> 07:34.266
If they don't let you in,
instead of saying fiddle-di-doo,

07:34.333 --> 07:35.867
you can switch to...

07:35.934 --> 07:39.633
<i>♪ Deedle didle deedle dum ♪</i>

07:44.000 --> 07:46.333
(serene music playing)

07:47.834 --> 07:49.900
Thanks for a lovely evening, Karl.

07:49.967 --> 07:51.433
Rose, I've got an idea.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.300
Let's go away for the weekend.

07:53.367 --> 07:56.233
Karl, I'm not sure I'm ready to.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.967
Because of this Miles?

07:58.033 --> 07:59.834
I don't want to push you,

07:59.900 --> 08:02.600
but I just wish I knew
what I was up against.

08:02.667 --> 08:06.066
Who is this guy? Where is he now?

08:06.133 --> 08:08.633
Oh, I wish I could tell you.

08:08.700 --> 08:11.333
I don't know anything
about him anymore.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.200
When I knew him,
he was a professor at a college.

08:14.266 --> 08:15.467
That's hard to believe.

08:15.533 --> 08:19.734
Well, it's one of the few places
they have professors.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.100
No. Yeah. No. I know that.

08:23.166 --> 08:26.667
I meant I can't believe
he left someone like you.

08:26.734 --> 08:30.000
He left someone else like me?

08:30.066 --> 08:31.166
No.

08:31.233 --> 08:33.266
I mean you.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.834
That he left you.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.767
Oh.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.600
Okay.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.100
I should be more clear.

08:42.166 --> 08:45.166
That would be great.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.567
I'll think about the weekend.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.433
I just want to be sure I'm ready.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.834
I'll give you a ring.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.033
I can't accept jewelry.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.767
I mean I'll call you soon.

09:01.033 --> 09:05.233
I mean I'll call you, Rose, soon.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.033
And the phone will ring.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.867
(sighs) Wow. He really
understands me.

09:24.166 --> 09:25.166
(sighs)

09:28.266 --> 09:32.066
Rose. Rose. It's me.

09:32.133 --> 09:33.934
Mi... Miles?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.266
I beg your pardon.

09:37.433 --> 09:40.266
I'm sure Blanche
will be out any minute.

09:43.266 --> 09:46.600
No, Rose. Rose. It's me.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.900
-Miles?
-I've come back, Rose.

09:48.967 --> 09:50.266
I had to see you.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.700
But you've changed.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.166
Well, I'm Amish, Rose.

09:55.233 --> 09:56.767
That's my new identity

09:56.834 --> 09:58.367
in the witness protection program.

09:58.433 --> 10:01.333
I'm an Amish man
on an Amish farm.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.600
I carry wood, I dig holes,
and I milk things,

10:04.667 --> 10:09.033
and, to be frank, it sucks.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.433
I've missed you, Rose.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.100
I've missed you, too, Miles.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.700
No, Rose. My name is Samuel.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.700
Samuel Plankmaker.

10:20.867 --> 10:23.934
Isn't it dangerous to be here?
You might have been followed.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.500
I took precautions.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.734
I even switched buggies
on the way over.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.900
Rose, of course you
can't tell a soul who I am.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.700
Don't worry. Your secret's safe.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.633
What am I going to do?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.100
You find out you're a Jew
with a dilemma,

10:41.166 --> 10:45.200
and these rabbis
just come out of the woodwork.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.667
Rose, who is this?

10:51.734 --> 10:54.500
This is... this is a friend.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.834
His name is Samuel.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.033
Samuel Plankmaker.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.000
Samuel, these are my roommates.

11:01.066 --> 11:03.900
Girls, you know Miles. Samuel!

11:03.967 --> 11:05.300
(Rose) Shoot.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.100
Sorry.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.800
I'm... I'm sorry, ladies.

11:09.867 --> 11:13.100
It's me. I was hoping to play
a trick on you.

11:13.166 --> 11:15.967
Silly rabbi. Tricks are for kids.

11:19.467 --> 11:22.400
Ladies, I know it's a lot to ask,

11:22.467 --> 11:24.867
but I had to see Rose.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.367
But I can't risk
leaving tonight.

11:27.433 --> 11:29.400
I need to stay here.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.800
Come on, Plankmaker.
I'll fix up a room.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.433
Oh. Thank you.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.500
Let me say that
I am against this.

11:37.567 --> 11:39.533
That Cheeseman character
could be following Miles.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.066
Who knows what he'll do
to me for information.

11:43.867 --> 11:46.667
Blanche, you are really
so self-centered.

11:46.734 --> 11:49.467
First, no gangster is going to come here.

11:49.533 --> 11:50.600
And secondly,

11:50.667 --> 11:53.266
Blanche, this is important to Rose.

11:53.333 --> 11:57.567
Aren't you interested
in Rose's happiness?

11:57.633 --> 12:00.500
Happiness?
I'm supposed to be happy?

12:00.567 --> 12:03.033
Just when I was getting on
with my life,

12:03.100 --> 12:04.100
Miles shows up.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.166
And for a visit. He can't even stay.

12:07.233 --> 12:10.433
How am I going to move on?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
How is my heart
ever supposed to heal

12:12.567 --> 12:14.633
with Miles here?

12:16.433 --> 12:17.367
(sighs)

12:18.967 --> 12:21.367
Do you really think
I'm self-centered?

12:23.467 --> 12:24.633
Huh?

12:29.300 --> 12:32.333
(tranquil music playing)

12:36.333 --> 12:38.400
Come on, y'all. Hurry up.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.567
Folks, I've got to
make a phone call.

12:41.633 --> 12:44.500
Rose, please get me some punch.

12:44.567 --> 12:47.333
He'll be late for the
initiation ceremony.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.600
Oh, take it easy, Feldman.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.400
Hello. Billy Club?

12:54.467 --> 12:57.200
It's me, Moran.

12:57.266 --> 13:00.266
No. Moran, The Cheeseman.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.500
I need some fake I.D.
to get out of the country.

13:03.567 --> 13:04.867
Yeah.

13:04.934 --> 13:08.533
I think my girlfriend's about to blab.
(laughs)

13:08.600 --> 13:11.166
Well, thank you,
Evelyn and Margaret

13:11.233 --> 13:13.934
for that gripping and realistic
re-enactment

13:14.000 --> 13:18.133
of the defeat of General Burnside's
troops at Fredericksburg.

13:24.633 --> 13:28.467
It's hard to believe you couldn't get
federal funding for this.

13:30.066 --> 13:34.300
-Mom says hi.
-I'm sorry. What?

13:34.367 --> 13:36.233
Rose, what's going on with you?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.033
You've been acting strange lately,

13:38.100 --> 13:40.333
like you're hiding
something from me.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.533
I can't lie to you.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.767
It's just not fair.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.867
I have been hiding something from you.

13:47.934 --> 13:51.200
I can't tell you where he's been,
but Miles is back.

13:51.266 --> 13:52.900
He's staying with me.

13:52.967 --> 13:54.667
I understand, Rose.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.600
Don't worry about your secret.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.900
It won't go any further than me.

13:58.967 --> 14:00.166
Oh.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.567
Now let's meet
our new applicants

14:02.633 --> 14:04.900
and hear their lineage
presentations.

14:04.967 --> 14:07.867
So let us begin with Mrs. Louise Blakely.

14:08.767 --> 14:11.967
Blanche, there is still time to back out.

14:12.033 --> 14:15.533
Can you go up there
and betray your heritage?

14:15.600 --> 14:17.600
Dorothy, I belong in this club.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.500
I'm just as southern
as the fruit of a scuppernong arbor

14:21.567 --> 14:23.867
growing proudly by the lazy Mississippi.

14:23.934 --> 14:27.266
Lawdy, lawdy, are you full of it.

14:29.767 --> 14:32.967
...who married my great-aunt
Anna Lou Sellers,

14:33.033 --> 14:35.533
cousin to Claude Livaudais,

14:35.600 --> 14:38.266
-who begat Elizabeth Blasingale--
-Wait a minute.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.600
Did you say Claude Livaudais?

14:40.667 --> 14:41.734
Yes.

14:41.800 --> 14:45.300
My great-grandfather
told stories of Claude Livaudais.

14:45.367 --> 14:49.033
He once sold horseshoes
to a Union soldier.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.166
Yankee.

14:50.233 --> 14:52.367
Oh, no. I can explain.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.367
Fie.

14:53.433 --> 14:54.300
Traitor.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.800
<i>Oy vey.</i>

15:01.066 --> 15:03.033
Well, that was a close one.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.100
We now call Blanche Devereaux.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.900
Dorothy, I can't see a thing.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.033
What's happening now?

15:11.100 --> 15:14.333
The Harlem Globetrotters
just took the court.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.500
Hello, ladies.
Thank you for making time for me.

15:19.567 --> 15:22.767
I wonder if, instead of reading
my family tree,

15:22.834 --> 15:24.066
I couldn't just say a few words

15:24.133 --> 15:27.300
about what the south means to me.

15:27.367 --> 15:31.500
No. We need your family tree.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.600
I see.

15:36.900 --> 15:37.934
Okay.

15:39.433 --> 15:43.633
Well, I am Blanche Devereaux,

15:43.700 --> 15:47.000
nee Hollingsworth of Atlanta,

15:47.066 --> 15:48.834
daughter of Curtis Hollingsworth

15:48.900 --> 15:53.133
and Samantha Roquet of Augusta
and Shreveport,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.533
daughter of...

15:59.166 --> 16:00.567
I can't do it.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.233
Daughter of Feldman.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.166
I'm a Feldman, damn it.

16:08.066 --> 16:09.867
Of buffalo.

16:09.934 --> 16:12.433
Oh.

16:14.633 --> 16:17.367
Oh, ladies, now, please.
I beg of you,

16:17.433 --> 16:19.700
let us put aside
our ancient prejudices

16:19.767 --> 16:21.433
and change these rules.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.900
Oh, ladies, let my people in.

16:24.967 --> 16:28.266
No. Next up, we have a lady--

16:28.333 --> 16:30.600
I would like to say something else,

16:30.667 --> 16:33.200
if you don't mind.

16:33.266 --> 16:34.467
Please let me in.

16:34.533 --> 16:35.867
No!

16:35.934 --> 16:39.367
That wasn't what
I was going to say.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.567
Yes, I am a Yankee.

16:41.633 --> 16:44.100
But hath not a Yankee eyes?

16:44.166 --> 16:46.100
Hath not a Yankee hands?

16:46.166 --> 16:48.667
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

16:48.734 --> 16:51.200
If you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

16:51.266 --> 16:53.734
Sometimes all night.
I've heard her.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.800
My point is,

16:58.867 --> 17:01.166
I am made up of many ingredients.

17:01.233 --> 17:05.166
Perhaps that is what gives me
my uniquely American flavor.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.367
Yes.

17:07.433 --> 17:09.166
For I am an American.

17:10.633 --> 17:11.967
And I'm leaving.

17:12.033 --> 17:14.900
I don't need your lousy club
to make me feel special.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.967
Oh, please.

17:22.033 --> 17:23.700
-No!
-No!

17:23.767 --> 17:25.700
Oh, you lost the war. Get over it.

17:29.967 --> 17:31.000
Oh, honey,

17:31.066 --> 17:32.734
I hope you're not too upset

17:32.800 --> 17:36.266
about not fitting in
with those dreadful people today.

17:36.333 --> 17:40.400
Those small-minded peckerwoods
aren't real southerners.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.233
I am a real southerner.

17:45.300 --> 17:47.467
Real southerners are
compassionate people.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.367
They're wise and gentle

17:49.433 --> 17:51.333
and they sit around porch swings

17:51.400 --> 17:55.934
regaling with stories
of Abraham and Moses and...

17:56.000 --> 17:59.200
and all the other people who
worked on the plantation.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.333
Well, I sent Karl home.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.133
Now I just have to talk to Miles.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.233
Talk to Miles?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.834
You're seeing somebody else, Rose?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.233
(stammering) I can explain.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.633
(Miles) No. I understand.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.533
Of course. You're dating.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.900
That's why I've come to a decision.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.100
I'll talk to the bureau.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.133
I am leaving
the Witness Protection Program.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.300
I need to be with you.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.433
But The Cheeseman's looking for you.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.567
Rose, don't worry.

18:29.633 --> 18:32.400
So, hope I'm not interrupting anything.

18:32.467 --> 18:33.533
Oh, my God.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.433
You. How did you find me?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.567
Time to say goodbye, buddy boy.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.667
Karl. Miles.

18:39.734 --> 18:41.367
As flattering as this is...

18:41.433 --> 18:47.100
-I... I don't want you fighting over me.
-Karl?

18:47.166 --> 18:49.200
You've been seeing this man?

18:49.266 --> 18:52.066
Uh-huh. But don't worry.
He's just a little jealous.

18:52.133 --> 18:55.767
That's a bad news, Rose.
It's not you he's after.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.133
He's using you to get to me.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.133
This is The Cheeseman.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.066
-Ah!
-Oh!

19:00.133 --> 19:02.200
What do I do with all of you?

19:02.266 --> 19:04.133
You can't just come into this house

19:04.200 --> 19:05.433
waving that gun around,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.033
although it is a very nice one.

19:08.867 --> 19:10.700
What is this, a colt?

19:11.734 --> 19:14.934
I knew this was a bad idea.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.433
I'm too young to be struck down.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.066
I've got to escape.

19:19.133 --> 19:19.967
(doorbell rings)

19:20.033 --> 19:22.967
-I'll get it.
-No one move.

19:23.033 --> 19:24.166
No one makes a sound.

19:24.233 --> 19:26.166
We all stand still
until they leave.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.200
Don't make a move,
old lady.

19:30.266 --> 19:34.033
Nice way to talk
to your mother, pussycat.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.633
-Who is it?
-Put these on and find out.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.600
My glasses.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.834
Where did you find them?

19:41.900 --> 19:44.934
Dreyfuss got them off the lanai.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.767
You should keep that gate closed.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.700
Anybody could get in here.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.467
It's great. I can finally see again.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.133
Hey, it's The Cheeseman.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.400
Come on.
Get in here, both of you.

19:58.467 --> 20:01.500
Sophia, you recognize Karl
as The Cheeseman?

20:01.567 --> 20:02.567
You don't?

20:02.633 --> 20:06.734
The man's been on <i>America's Most Wanted</i>
at least six times.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.767
The last episode was
the highest rated ever.

20:10.567 --> 20:11.800
Ever.

20:11.867 --> 20:13.900
That must be a good feeling.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.133
It's kind of an acknowledgment.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.533
I hate to interrupt you,
but I have some bad news.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.767
It's all over.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.934
That's right. You're busted.
Barbara's a cop.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.633
In a dress. Without a gun.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.567
What you have here is
a crossing guard thing.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.734
All you gals get locked
in the closet,

20:39.800 --> 20:42.633
and us boys are going for a walk.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.934
Wow. Were you ever activities director

20:45.000 --> 20:47.467
of a place called Shady Pines?

20:48.900 --> 20:53.033
We got a lot of old business
to discuss.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.200
Can't you do anything, Barbara?

20:55.266 --> 20:57.066
-I suppose I could do this.
-(gasps)

20:57.133 --> 20:59.000
Cheeseman, you're under arrest.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.834
You told us you didn't have a gun.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.800
You lied.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.667
To a bad guy.

21:06.734 --> 21:09.300
It's okay to lie to a bad guy.

21:09.367 --> 21:11.200
You see? There are so many things

21:11.266 --> 21:14.800
we as the public don't understand.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.467
I'll take this creep outside.

21:17.533 --> 21:19.467
Call the station for backup.

21:19.533 --> 21:21.400
And I need some handcuffs
right away.

21:24.033 --> 21:27.266
Oh. Oh. Okay.
You can borrow mine.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.967
But be careful with them.
They're a gift.

21:35.500 --> 21:40.100
Ma, why don't we make that phone call
from the kitchen.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.066
Rose.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.567
Rose, it's over.

21:43.633 --> 21:45.834
I'm free. I can be with you now,

21:45.900 --> 21:47.834
if that's still what you want.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.900
That's all I've ever wanted.

21:52.266 --> 21:55.033
But you have to promise never
to leave me again.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.734
I might have to for a little while.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.467
Back on my farm in Pennsylvania,

22:00.533 --> 22:03.734
I still have an order in
for 13 windmills.

22:04.867 --> 22:07.266
Oh, screw 'em. What are they
going to do, phone?

22:17.400 --> 22:21.700
(theme music playing)
