01:16.034 --> 01:18.453
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY PAULA PIMENTA

01:19.413 --> 01:23.208
DJ CINDERELLA

01:31.466 --> 01:34.344
<i>That's me, living my dream.</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:36.847
<i>To be a successful DJ at a nightclub!</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:49.276
Cíntia, wake up! Wake up, Cíntia!

01:49.359 --> 01:53.322
<i>And this is Patrícia.</i>
<i>Once again, messing with my dreams.</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:54.656
Cíntia, wake up!

01:55.365 --> 01:58.619
Sleeping in your parents' party?
What will people think?

01:58.702 --> 02:02.539
That you're a fake who's trying to destroy
my family's happiness!

02:02.831 --> 02:04.791
<i>That's what I should have said.</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:08.045
<i>But since I had no idea</i>
<i>what was going to happen, I said:</i>

02:08.128 --> 02:11.757
you're right, Patrícia, sweetheart,
I'll go mingle.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.697
<i>Life in my house was always a party.</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:38.950
<i>Those two are my parents.</i>

02:39.076 --> 02:41.453
<i>So beautiful and loving!</i>

02:41.828 --> 02:45.332
<i>In my family, everyone believed in love.</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:48.001
-Men are a disgrace!
-What is it, aunt?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.796
Rafa got jealous because I talked
to the waiter!

02:50.879 --> 02:52.464
-Come on!
<i>-Except for aunt Helena.</i>

02:52.547 --> 02:55.592
-Is it Rafa who pays my bills?
-But isn't it, aunt?

02:57.260 --> 02:58.303
At this stage, it actually is.

02:58.387 --> 03:03.016
But only until I become the star
of Brazilian poetry.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.227
-Come on, aunt...
-No one's buying my freedom!

03:05.852 --> 03:08.855
You know what? I'll get some juice,
because I'm not obligated to anyone!

03:13.360 --> 03:17.739
-Wow, Cíntia! You look beautiful!
-Looking like a princess.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.701
And you look like two hags
from a horror movie.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.955
<i>I'd love to have said that</i>
<i>to Patrícia's hypocrite daughters.</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:26.123
<i>But I said:</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:27.749
you look beautiful, too.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.627
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

03:34.631 --> 03:37.926
Look, Rafa! It's a piano piece I want
to surprise my parents with.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.386
Is this yours?

03:39.469 --> 03:43.056
-It will spice up the couple's song.
-That's the idea, right?

03:43.181 --> 03:45.809
-Do you think they'll like it?
-That's cool, Cíntia.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.519
You always do well. Go get them!

03:51.940 --> 03:53.358
<i>Rafa is a piece of work.</i>

03:53.567 --> 03:57.779
<i>He and aunt Helena are a case</i>
<i>of opposites that form a perfect pair.</i>

03:58.363 --> 04:01.283
<i>But people say love is like this:</i>
<i>when it hits, it hits.</i>

04:01.950 --> 04:03.034
Ouch!

04:04.453 --> 04:07.038
<i>That's me, Freddy Prince.</i>

04:07.122 --> 04:10.083
<i>And now I'm going to tell</i>
<i>my version of this party.</i>

04:11.293 --> 04:12.878
Bonjour, beautiful!

04:12.961 --> 04:15.881
Today the Belinha's channel will enter
the Dorella family mansion

04:15.964 --> 04:17.841
to see how the rich have fun.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.845
How they dance, how they dress,
what they eat!

04:21.970 --> 04:24.014
Let's find out now. Come with me!

04:25.932 --> 04:28.727
All right, Bê. You can't complain
about your friend here.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.645
Now let's go back. I have to play.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.359
If I were you, I'd give up on the quartet
and focus on my own music.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.361
Classical music only works in Germany.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.072
In Germany and at this party,
because they pay well!

04:41.323 --> 04:43.241
The money goes to recording my music, Bê.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.744
-Sell-out!
-And there's more!

04:46.036 --> 04:48.038
If I hadn't come, who'd have got you in?

04:48.121 --> 04:51.666
Now you have exclusive content
for your half a dozen followers!

04:53.084 --> 04:56.296
One day I'll explode and you'll beg me

04:56.379 --> 04:58.757
to give props to your music on my channel.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.010
I'll think about playing
in your little channel, alright?

05:02.677 --> 05:03.762
Keep dreaming!

05:04.012 --> 05:06.139
Before I go play,
I'll change the sneakers

05:06.223 --> 05:08.850
because the client demanded dress shoes.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.977
I think they're in my bag. I don't know.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.229
Relax, we got time!

05:12.312 --> 05:14.272
Let's see if we find someone interesting!

05:14.356 --> 05:16.691
-I'm here for work, Bê.
-You only think of work!

05:16.983 --> 05:20.237
You stay home all day,
writing songs about perfect love.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.531
"Where will my princess be?"

05:22.614 --> 05:25.534
Find a flesh and bones princess
to know the real thing.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.662
I see nothing here that fits me, Bê,
look at that!

05:28.787 --> 05:30.831
Yeah. It's going to be tough here.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.916
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

05:34.876 --> 05:39.047
There, the quartet guys are back.
Go play, and I'll film the place.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.218
Is the break over?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.470
What are we jamming now?

05:45.554 --> 05:50.141
I'm jamming you out of here
if you don't wear proper shoes.

05:50.392 --> 05:51.726
Come on boy, go! Get them out now.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.604
No, I won't.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.691
You don't own the house.
You're an employee.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.861
Right? You stuck-up secretary.
You don't write the rules.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.988
And you're also very rude.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.241
<i>I'd have said that if I knew</i>
<i>who in fact she was.</i>

06:06.324 --> 06:08.994
-Go, boy! Take them off!
-Alright, of course!

06:09.452 --> 06:11.621
I'd better be smart and obey, right?

06:11.705 --> 06:14.749
Exactly.
Robson, stand here now.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.426
So...

06:25.135 --> 06:27.304
I left my shoe at home.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.097
We have a problem.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.058
We have a problem? You have a problem.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.603
Look around, my dear.
See what's going on?

06:34.686 --> 06:37.731
-It's a party for classy people, get it?
-No, I don't.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.108
People like me, classy, fine, elegant.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.568
-Rude?
-No, honest.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.906
Which may sound the same, right?
Depending on the situation.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.866
And this is your situation:

06:48.283 --> 06:51.912
get a decent shoe or get out.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.663
Alright, but give me back my sneakers.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.334
Lost your tone, musician?
Now you want your sneakers?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.462
Catch! Go get it!

07:01.588 --> 07:03.340
-Oh, my God! Cíntia!
-Ouch!

07:03.423 --> 07:05.091
Oh, my God! Are you alright?

07:05.175 --> 07:07.510
-Are you fine? Does it hurt?
-No, it's fine.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.138
It was this stupid musician
who's wearing this garbage.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.683
-I'm expelling him...
-Don't be silly, Patrícia, let him play!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.809
What is the problem?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.782
Annoying girl. How long will I have
to put up with her?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.368
Me too, mom! How long?
She has everything I don't:

07:31.451 --> 07:33.453
more clothes, more shoes, more bags...

07:33.536 --> 07:36.289
-The only thing I have more than her...
-It's envy!

07:36.414 --> 07:40.377
-It's something, right?
-Easy! Calm down, momma's cubs.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.671
This game will turn,
the story will change.

07:42.754 --> 07:44.130
What story? On Instagram?

07:44.673 --> 07:47.384
What is it, guys?
It could be on Facebook!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.552
-I don't know.
-Look, it's going to start.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.682
Oh, this is very good!

08:39.477 --> 08:40.353
César!

08:44.899 --> 08:45.942
César!

08:47.777 --> 08:48.987
Come, love.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.239
What got into you?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.700
-Sorry, dad, it was a surprise.
-Daughter...

08:53.783 --> 08:56.077
-I thought you'd like it.
-That was Beethoven.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.289
-And you messed it up adding... whatever.
-Easy, César!

08:59.372 --> 09:01.082
-You've embarrassed me!
-Dad!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.834
-Easy!
-You nailed it.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086
She had it coming!

09:05.170 --> 09:07.297
If only I had a powerful father
like that...

09:07.547 --> 09:10.550
Do you want the royal life
that fool takes for granted?

09:10.675 --> 09:12.343
Do you? Come with me.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.013
No, you stay, I didn't call you. Let's go.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.229
Got it, Graziele? Now go. Go hide.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.233
César!

09:28.276 --> 09:29.569
What a shame!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.573
An important man like you
doesn't deserve this.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.034
But I'm here, my love.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.286
I'm here, whatever happens.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.497
-Always here.
-I didn't want this party,

09:40.830 --> 09:42.373
-you know it.
-I know.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.125
Ana insisted so much!

09:44.542 --> 09:47.045
-I'm not complaining, am I?
-No.

09:47.128 --> 09:51.674
I'm not saying: "Ditch your wife,
give me a good life, give my girls a dad,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.719
be a man and realize
that I'm the one for you, you moron."

09:55.261 --> 09:56.805
Am I saying that?

09:59.808 --> 10:02.936
Of course not, my love, you're an angel.
You'd never say that.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.230
Never, your love is enough for me.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.068
Don't mind your dad.
You know how he is, don't you?

10:10.151 --> 10:13.947
-Your father is traditional.
-He's wrong, Ana. And so are you.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.990
Giving up on your career for this fossil.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.659
-Helena!
-He's your dinosaur!

10:17.742 --> 10:20.120
He's my love.
Do you know what love is?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.164
For love, you give up on some things.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.167
And, to this day, I don't regret
having married César!

10:34.676 --> 10:35.844
César...

10:41.057 --> 10:42.475
Till this day, right?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.272
<i>And that's when I stopped believing</i>
<i>in love.</i>

11:28.730 --> 11:32.233
<i>I learned from my mother</i>
<i>that we have to look to the future.</i>

11:33.109 --> 11:35.445
<i>Two years after leaving my father's house,</i>

11:35.528 --> 11:39.115
<i>we felt that nothing could limit</i>
<i>our dreams.</i>

11:40.533 --> 11:42.785
I'm glad you arrived on time, my love.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.579
I thought you weren't coming.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.875
-Of course I came, mom.
-I'll miss you so much!

11:49.125 --> 11:52.795
And, your crazy aunt!
After all, I stayed here for a long time.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.506
Two years, right?
Two years aren't two days.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.759
I got used to having you here, sis.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.677
It's an unique opportunity, you know?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.347
-I know.
-You worked hard for the scholarship.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.891
-Archaeology has always been your passion.
-Since childhood!

12:04.974 --> 12:07.393
She dug bones from the garden
and said it was a mummy.

12:07.477 --> 12:11.022
Then grandma would say:
"This is a chicken bone, you menace!"

12:12.732 --> 12:15.151
Look what a beautiful family I got!

12:15.944 --> 12:17.695
He acts like he's married to me.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.114
What are you saying, my partner?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.243
I'll be fine, mom, I promise.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.204
Go after your dreams
and I'll go after mine.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.623
-Studying music in London.
-You'll succeed,

12:28.706 --> 12:31.626
-I know you will.
-Cíntia will be a star.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.962
-I believe in her future.
-Me too.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.132
-Travel safely.
-Take care of her.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.634
-Trust me.
-Thanks.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.764
-Bye, mom.
-Bye, my love. Take care.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.016
-You too.
-I love you so much!

13:08.997 --> 13:11.457
THE KING OF ROMANTIC BALLADS
OF THE INTERNET

13:12.208 --> 13:13.501
Did you remember Cat?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.587
What cat? There is no cat here!
Are you crazy?

13:16.713 --> 13:19.632
The little mouse, girl.
You have to feed him.

13:19.757 --> 13:24.053
That Cat?
Who would name a mouse "Cat"?

13:26.306 --> 13:29.142
I named it Cat because
of the guy who gave it to me.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.560
The guy was a stray.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.854
You and your boyfriends, aunt.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.732
By the way, wasn't it this cat
who disappeared?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.400
No! That was Dog.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.069
He gave me this cat.

13:40.403 --> 13:44.741
-Then, in his memory...
-You named the cat "Dog".

13:45.158 --> 13:47.493
This one was given to me by an ex

13:47.577 --> 13:51.331
who wasn't worth a rotten tomato.
Did I tell you that story?

13:51.414 --> 13:54.625
If the parakeet is called "Chicken",
you don't need to tell.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.336
Cíntia, the truth is this:

13:56.753 --> 13:59.589
animals are noble except for men,
they're all strays.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.592
That's why my motto is:
pick them up, but don't cling to them.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.344
That goes for Rafa too.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.554
Hi, love. Did you say something?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.307
"Don't cling" and here you are,
together for two years.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.185
-Imagine if you clung.
-Alright, Cíntia, quit the crap.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.980
I want to know what you think
of my newest concrete poetry.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.523
-Let me hear it.
-Attention!

14:20.693 --> 14:23.488
"The mass, the carcass,

14:24.238 --> 14:27.075
the bagasse, the lass and the class,

14:27.158 --> 14:29.869
the boat and the goat,

14:30.328 --> 14:33.581
that squeezes my throat,

14:33.790 --> 14:37.710
mine, ours, yours, the turtle's hole!"

14:39.087 --> 14:40.129
What's up?

14:40.755 --> 14:44.300
-Do turtles have holes, aunt?
-No, it's not in that sense.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.845
-It's where it lives, the turtle's hole.
-Got it.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.681
-It's very concrete, isn't it?
-You were amazing, my love!

14:50.765 --> 14:53.726
I think you're amazing.
Let me kiss you, my softie.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.104
Softie, Rafa? Have mercy!

14:56.604 --> 14:57.730
Hold on, Helena!

14:59.565 --> 15:01.359
-What did I do?
-You were soft.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.694
Soft and concrete. You see, right?

15:03.778 --> 15:06.489
-Each one has a talent, right?
-Never mind, she's silly.

15:06.572 --> 15:10.118
In fact, how about we take this time
to practice with your music?

15:10.201 --> 15:11.828
-Let's practice!
-Let's go!

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
Alright. Go.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.460
Always keep the pace.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.172
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.303
It goes up and then you go down
and then you pull out.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.056
Look at the bass.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.643
Now eight more.

15:37.603 --> 15:38.729
Lower the bass.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.817
Good!

16:00.168 --> 16:03.713
Very good! You're doing great!

16:03.796 --> 16:06.924
If you keep this up
and get good grades in school,

16:07.008 --> 16:09.760
you'll get that scholarship in London.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.889
Rafa, you could let her play
in some parties,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.932
-to get some practice.
-I promise I'll try.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.268
Don't be all over me, alright?
I need some air.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.898
<i>Cíntia, I'm coming. Let's go to class.</i>

16:22.523 --> 16:25.693
Lara, I wish I could skip class
to stay here learning from Rafa.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.404
Yeah, but I can't. I have to go, Cíntia.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.073
-We'll practice more later.
-Stay a little longer

16:31.157 --> 16:32.950
to hear more of my concrete poetry.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.495
-Lara, wait for me, I'm going.
-No! Wait! "The green!

16:35.578 --> 16:38.873
The plants! Photosynthesis!
One, two, three, four..."

16:39.248 --> 16:41.334
Good morning. Hi!

16:41.459 --> 16:44.170
-Hi, girl. Let's go?
-Let's go.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.558
Cycling is good for fat people, right?

16:57.642 --> 17:01.229
Better than going to the gym
just to post pictures!

17:01.312 --> 17:03.481
-Ignore it.
-Come on, Graziele.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.816
-Leave it alone.
-But she teased me, mom!

17:05.900 --> 17:07.777
Against facts there are no arguments!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
-Less, Gisele.
-Less what, mom?

17:09.946 --> 17:12.198
In your case, less weight would help,
alright?

17:12.281 --> 17:15.368
-Mom, come on!
-Truth hurts but strengthens!

17:15.451 --> 17:17.036
Get out, you two, out of the car!

17:17.119 --> 17:18.120
-Go, Graziele.
-Go!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.748
So you know who's going to play
on my birthday?

17:20.831 --> 17:22.792
Our birthday, Graziele! We're twins.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.877
Same mother, but not the same father.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.546
How come, if we're twins?

17:26.629 --> 17:29.507
Gisele, my angel,
there must be a genetic explanation

17:29.590 --> 17:31.551
for me to be like this and you...

17:31.884 --> 17:33.094
-like that.
-What?

17:33.261 --> 17:36.764
Leave me alone, girl!
Let me tell the news, please?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.724
Do you know who'll play on my birthday?

17:38.808 --> 17:41.978
-Who?
-Go away, you won't be invited.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.230
Freddy Prince!

17:44.897 --> 17:49.694
In flesh and bone, rhythm and poetry!

18:21.100 --> 18:23.936
<i>After I started putting</i>
<i>my songs on the internet,</i>

18:24.020 --> 18:27.857
<i>I discovered that there's still</i>
<i>people wanting to talk about love.</i>

18:30.026 --> 18:33.195
<i>Soon I started to receive show proposals,</i>

18:33.279 --> 18:36.449
<i>record label contracts</i>
<i>and even an international tour.</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:21.994
-Your fans will go nuts, it's perfect.
-Yeah, it got better but...

19:22.536 --> 19:23.454
something's missing.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.041
You should go out more, see some people.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.293
You have to enjoy success a bit, Freddy.

19:29.377 --> 19:32.755
You only talk about love,
but you have to stop idealizing it and...

19:32.838 --> 19:35.091
start living!
Get a girlfriend!

19:35.841 --> 19:39.428
What boyfriend, mom?
I want to go after my dreams.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.973
Alright, my love.
Now let me tell you something.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.893
We've found remnants
from the mummy of a queen

19:45.976 --> 19:48.270
miles from the mummy of a king.
Can you believe it?

19:48.354 --> 19:51.399
See? Even mummies keep men away.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.612
And speaking of mummies,
can you believe daddy put

19:56.696 --> 19:59.198
both of Patrícia's girls in my school?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.784
They even have the guts to call him dad

20:01.867 --> 20:04.203
in front of everyone.
Seriously, mom!

20:04.286 --> 20:06.872
Daughter, mom can't talk now,
I have to go.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.541
Now take care, my love.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.419
-I love you, alright?
-I miss you. I love you.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.258
Hi! Did you know Freddy Prince will give
an exclusive show

20:17.341 --> 20:19.635
-at my birthday party?
-Really?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.554
So? I don't like his music!

20:21.637 --> 20:22.972
-She doesn't like it!
-She doesn't like it!

20:23.055 --> 20:25.307
-Right!
-But this is great,

20:25.391 --> 20:28.018
because now you have
an excuse not to go, right?

20:28.102 --> 20:32.273
After all, it was daddy who invited you.
If it depended on me, you wouldn't go.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.363
Like I'm leaving my house to see
Freddy Prince and his cheeky songs.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.701
I like Freddy's music.
His lyrics are so beautiful!

20:44.326 --> 20:47.037
I wish André said those things to me!

20:47.121 --> 20:50.541
Boring lyrics.
"I'll greet the sea,

20:50.666 --> 20:53.461
my heart is high, love at first sight."

20:54.253 --> 20:57.089
For someone who doesn't like,
you know them well. Right?

20:57.214 --> 20:59.592
Of course, I don't criticize
without knowing.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.012
I heard the songs
that's why I know they are awful.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.347
-Hi, Cíntia. Are you all right, cutie?
-Hi, boys!

21:05.431 --> 21:07.641
I was talking to Cíntia
about seeing a movie.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.769
-Let's go, André?
-You didn't say that!

21:09.852 --> 21:12.480
Lara, your shot's gone.
I'm sorry, all right?

21:12.605 --> 21:16.567
Have you seen the app we invented?
More like I invented it. The Vibracheat.

21:16.859 --> 21:19.069
-What is it?
-An app for cheating on tests.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.781
It's easy, look!
A long vibration is the question number.

21:21.864 --> 21:25.075
And short vibrations are the answers,
like A, B, C, D.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.661
-Nice, right?
-No, it's easier to study, isn't it?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.789
For those who like it.
Come on, Diego.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.001
That way the guy will give up on you.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.337
He should, with that stupid app.

21:36.504 --> 21:38.506
You need therapy, do you know that?

21:38.589 --> 21:42.676
"My parents divorced, I'm traumatized,
nobody cares, blah, blah, blah..."

21:42.760 --> 21:45.638
The worse was you calling André
out of nowhere to go out.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.390
-Lara, he doesn't like you.
-If you say so!

21:48.474 --> 21:51.101
I know he loves me.
He even promised to marry me.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.229
Yeah, when you were seven, right?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.105
So what? Children are honest.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.650
And I'm the one who needs therapy. Bye.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.986
Cíntia! Run, Cíntia!

22:01.403 --> 22:05.115
Come here, girl. Rafa wants you
to play at a party now!

22:05.199 --> 22:06.867
Now? In the afternoon?

22:06.951 --> 22:09.787
So what? It must be a crazy pool party.

22:10.204 --> 22:14.041
Prepare the set today! We'll rock it
with your music at the club!

22:27.096 --> 22:29.557
Aunty, define a crazy pool party.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.017
Rafa will pay for this!

22:32.101 --> 22:35.437
But look on the bright side,
you're here forming an audience.

22:36.564 --> 22:37.857
I'll get you some snacks.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.737
Phonograph lady,
can you lower the sound a bit?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.364
I can't hear anything.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.325
-I'm sorry, ma'am, if I lower...
-What?

22:49.159 --> 22:53.038
If I lower it a bit more,
nobody will be able to hear the music.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.625
I'll complain to the party host.
What's your name again?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.169
-Cíntia Dorella.
-Cinderella?

22:59.253 --> 23:01.213
Yeah! It's DJ Cinderella.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.966
What a piece of work! Cinderella!

23:04.508 --> 23:06.093
DJ Cinderella.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.722
Beautiful, wonderful, a spectacle!

23:09.847 --> 23:12.099
-Am I beautiful, mom?
-I was talking about myself.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.101
Wow, I look amazing!

23:14.518 --> 23:18.188
-Gisele, my dear, do you like this mask?
-Pretty, right?

23:18.272 --> 23:20.316
Wear it, to hide your ugliness.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.652
Graziele, don't mess with your sister,
or you'll look even uglier.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.237
Sorry, I didn't mean that!

23:25.321 --> 23:28.365
-No, mom. You're forgiven.
-I was apologizing to Graziele.

23:28.449 --> 23:32.202
-Mom!
-Darling, inner beauty also counts.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.997
-And, on the inside, you're full of...
-Fat.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.248
Values.

23:36.707 --> 23:40.461
Your inner values are heavy,
I mean, they count a lot.

23:40.544 --> 23:44.048
-I have a normal weight, mother!
-Anyone can do normal, Gisele.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.592
What sets us apart, daughter? Beauty.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.385
Being beautiful inside also counts,

23:48.469 --> 23:51.221
but outside a few less kilos would help
a big deal, you know?

23:51.597 --> 23:54.350
-I don't agree.
-Darling, truth hurts but strengthens.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.977
-Stop laughing.
-Accept that you're fat!

23:57.061 --> 23:58.437
-I'm not fat.
-Yes, you are!

23:58.520 --> 23:59.688
Hey!

24:01.065 --> 24:04.193
Dear sister, you look so beautiful!

24:04.610 --> 24:07.071
You look lovely. And mom?

24:07.154 --> 24:08.739
-Mom looks like an angel!
-Mom looks like an angel!

24:08.822 --> 24:11.450
My babies!

24:11.784 --> 24:14.370
You know that mom is an Amelia, right?

24:14.453 --> 24:17.247
No vanity at all.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.749
César, I didn't see you there!

24:19.166 --> 24:22.670
What beautiful women! True court ladies.

24:22.753 --> 24:25.881
Court dance is the theme of the party.
How do we look?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.759
Beautiful.
I wish Cíntia were like you!

24:28.842 --> 24:31.762
-Beautiful?
-No, my love, she's beautiful.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.931
I wish she were this sweet
and affectionate.

24:34.014 --> 24:37.309
Let's talk about good things.
The girls want to thank you

24:37.393 --> 24:41.355
for hiring Freddy Prince to play
on their fifteenth birthday party.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.732
It's alright.
You're his fans, aren't you?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.734
-Just look at this.
-Look.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.863
Look at that!

24:50.155 --> 24:51.782
Does Cíntia like this Freddy Prince?

24:51.865 --> 24:54.284
-That one doesn't like anyone.
-What is it, my love?

24:54.618 --> 24:57.788
The boy conquers anyone, right?
Look how pretty he is.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.291
I hope so. Now, will you excuse me?
Dad's going to travel...

25:01.375 --> 25:05.629
Already? No, my love!
I'm going to miss you so much!

25:11.385 --> 25:12.803
Goodbye!

25:12.928 --> 25:14.888
It took so long this time!

25:15.889 --> 25:17.808
So much to solve for the party!

25:17.891 --> 25:19.727
Mom, Freddy has to love the party!

25:19.810 --> 25:22.438
Love! Because I love him
and I want to marry him.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.566
You and Freddy? How crazy!
This is impossible.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.736
Impossible is a place
which doesn't exist, child.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.321
It's "far away is a place
which doesn't exist", mom.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.740
But you get it, right?

25:32.823 --> 25:36.744
What mom meant was that there are
no barriers to our dreams, right?

25:36.952 --> 25:38.287
Look at mom's example.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.790
Mom was a very poor girl.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.627
Mom had to work hard to get things, see?

25:46.545 --> 25:51.216
To win the Miss Pool contest,
I had to forge the result.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.261
Mom always finds a way!

25:54.845 --> 25:58.432
The test to work at the firm:
mom stole the answers

25:58.515 --> 26:00.350
and got first place.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.978
Mom always finds a way!

26:03.312 --> 26:07.149
Even to conquer César,
what did mom have to do?

26:07.232 --> 26:08.817
Should we answer that?

26:09.443 --> 26:12.780
To find a way!
Mom always finds a way.

26:13.030 --> 26:16.992
Mom, I want to be like you and do
whatever it takes to catch Freddy.

26:17.367 --> 26:20.204
Is that what you want?
So that's what you'll get.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.955
You just need to focus!

26:22.039 --> 26:23.916
-And what do I need, mom?
-To lose weight.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.668
Mom, I don't.
I already told you, I'm normal.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.378
Darling, listen to your mother.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.466
Normal people hate themselves, my dear.
I'll schedule you therapy. You need it.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.524
Were those three or four short vibrations?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.567
Two short ones and a long one, I think.

26:52.194 --> 26:53.779
Or a short one and two long ones?

26:57.699 --> 27:00.536
<i>You've abused the confidence</i>
<i>of the school.</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:05.207
<i>Using the cell phone to cheat.</i>
<i>That is fraud.</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:09.044
<i>From now on, It's forbidden</i>
<i>to use cell phones at school.</i>

27:09.128 --> 27:11.588
What? What about my mother? How absurd!

27:11.672 --> 27:16.135
<i>Your parents have the school number</i>
<i>for any emergency.</i>

27:16.218 --> 27:17.052
Yes, Cíntia.

27:17.344 --> 27:20.139
-During recess, will we be able to use it?
<i>-No.</i>

27:20.848 --> 27:24.351
<i>Recess is for your socialization.</i>

27:24.434 --> 27:25.936
<i>Talk to each other.</i>

27:26.395 --> 27:28.689
It's all your fault, morons.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.901
"Calm down"? How am I going
to talk to my mother now?

27:33.026 --> 27:36.029
It had to be during recess
because of Japan's time zone.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.073
It's twelve hours apart!

27:38.198 --> 27:41.410
Yeah, looks like you're screwed.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.455
But look, talk to your father,
he's important.

27:45.539 --> 27:48.417
Wasn't it his company that donated
all the computers?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.835
I didn't want this!

27:49.918 --> 27:53.797
But friend, it's for a good cause.
They can't ban cell phones!

27:55.924 --> 27:58.719
Look at André, he must be devastated!

27:58.802 --> 28:01.346
Lara, forget this boy.
You deserve better.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.933
-He doesn't care about you.
-Girl, it's love, what can I do?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.894
Have a little more self-love.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.981
That's why I don't fall in love.
I don't want to look like you.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.448
Rafa, how are you?

28:19.573 --> 28:20.908
It's all cool.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.702
Look, they called me
for a last-minute trip.

28:23.785 --> 28:25.913
Can you cover a party for me?

28:25.996 --> 28:28.916
-For real?
-I'm serious, for real.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.126
But this time it's a cool party.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.838
Good money, professional equipment,
laser harp...

28:35.047 --> 28:38.383
You'll only play until midnight.
No problem being under age.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.928
Of course I'll do it!
Where will you play?

28:41.011 --> 28:43.722
I'm going to play in a rave in Recife!

28:43.805 --> 28:46.225
-Are you kidding? How awesome!
-Cool, for real!

28:46.308 --> 28:47.392
So, are you ready?

28:47.476 --> 28:50.187
You can trust me, Rafa. I'm super ready.

28:50.270 --> 28:54.149
I want to see that.
Cool. I'll text you the address, alright?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.067
Cool.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.571
Hi, Domingos!

28:59.655 --> 29:02.115
Girl, Rafa called me to play at a party.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.618
There will be a lot of people, laser harp.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.536
I don't know, he'll text me later.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.996
But, girl, I'm super anxious.

29:09.164 --> 29:14.127
Scared? Me? Of playing?
Am I a woman who gets scared, Lara?

29:15.754 --> 29:16.922
What is it, girl?

29:18.131 --> 29:19.132
Aunt...

29:19.633 --> 29:22.427
It's my costume for today's presentation.
Is it that ugly?

29:22.511 --> 29:26.682
Yeah, it's not ugly, but...
What presentation is it?

29:26.765 --> 29:30.269
I'll perform with a group
of Bolivians who loved my texts.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.561
Did they understand them?

29:31.895 --> 29:34.648
-I didn't get the question.
-Forget it.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.233
Where will this thing be?

29:36.316 --> 29:39.736
So, a super nice place,
a clandestine casino!

29:39.820 --> 29:40.821
Aunt!

29:40.904 --> 29:42.823
Casinos are forbidden, the law says so.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.118
It's forbidden to forbid, Caetano says so.

29:46.201 --> 29:50.205
What's up? Isn't it amazing?
I amaze myself!

29:51.081 --> 29:53.083
DAD

29:58.046 --> 30:00.007
<i>-Cíntia?</i>
-Who else could it be, father?

30:00.966 --> 30:03.677
It's been difficult to talk
to you lately, darling.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.847
<i>-Hi, honey? Are you there?</i>
-Yes. What do you want?

30:07.180 --> 30:09.808
I want to confirm your presence
at the twins party.

30:10.392 --> 30:13.520
My love, not everything is simple.
Dad knows he screwed up.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.272
I don't want to talk about it.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.774
Dad, I have a problem.

30:18.275 --> 30:19.401
What problem, daughter?

30:19.484 --> 30:21.945
They banned cell phones at school.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.197
It makes sense, I think it's great.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.700
It may be great for you,
but for me it's awful.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.618
How will I talk to my mother in Japan?

30:28.785 --> 30:31.955
Well, I can solve this for you,

30:32.039 --> 30:35.083
just as you can go
to Gisele and Graziele's party.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.294
<i>I sent you the invitation.</i>
<i>Did you get it?</i>

30:38.587 --> 30:40.547
FIFTEENTH BIRTHDAY PARTY

30:40.630 --> 30:43.884
Then you said no to your father?
I can't believe!

30:43.967 --> 30:47.929
That's right. Imagine that!
Blackmailed by my own father now.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.306
That's all I need.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.100
But, anyway, I can't even go
to this party.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.477
I'm playing at another one.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.613
Hi! My name should be
on the service list, I'm the DJ.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.531
Cíntia!

31:08.283 --> 31:09.117
Dad?

31:09.201 --> 31:10.160
My daughter.

31:12.829 --> 31:13.997
My love!

31:14.915 --> 31:18.543
Daughter, I'm glad you decided to come
to your sisters' party.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.629
I'm serious. Right, girls?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.091
And why aren't you wearing a costume?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.552
I didn't know it was a matter
of obligation.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.805
Obligation? Never!

31:30.180 --> 31:34.184
Consideration maybe, but that's silly.
What matters is that you came.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.685
Right, girls?

31:36.311 --> 31:37.270
Exactly!

31:38.897 --> 31:40.982
Come here. I'll help you.
Come on.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.444
How could I know it was the same party?

31:44.528 --> 31:46.822
By comparing the addresses. Right, dummy?

31:46.905 --> 31:49.616
I didn't notice,
I wasn't even coming to this party.

31:49.699 --> 31:53.745
-If my dad sees me as a DJ, he'll kill me.
-How will you play without being seen?

31:53.829 --> 31:57.207
So... I had an idea,
but I need your help.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.337
Daughter, where were you, my love?

32:02.421 --> 32:05.465
Me? Walking around, seeing the party.
It's very nice.

32:05.549 --> 32:08.635
Oh no! The DJ hasn't come yet.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.637
I want music when Freddy Prince arrives.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.181
Calm down, she must be late, that's all.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.892
She? Is the DJ a woman?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.019
I don't know, that's what I heard.

32:18.145 --> 32:18.979
Where?

32:19.062 --> 32:21.523
No need to explain,
I've figured it all out.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.777
The DJ company that the house hired
belongs to her aunt's boyfriend.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.530
The irresponsible Rafael.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.699
-I'll call him.
-Yes, my love.

32:31.408 --> 32:34.202
Freddy!
Freddy Prince has arrived!

32:35.620 --> 32:37.622
Freddy!

32:38.331 --> 32:40.584
Freddy! I'm the birthday girl!

32:40.667 --> 32:42.043
-We are!
-But I'm more.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.379
And I'm Patrícia, mother of the twins.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.589
I'm such a fan!

32:45.672 --> 32:47.591
-We are!
-But I'm more!

32:47.716 --> 32:49.092
Get out, girl!

32:49.176 --> 32:51.386
Sorry, have we already met?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.639
Hardly. I'm too remarkable for you
to doubt.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.768
Well, I've been Miss Pool 2004!
Was that the occasion?

32:59.019 --> 33:02.105
-I think not.
-I'm a very important woman, you know?

33:02.189 --> 33:05.233
Very commented, photographed,
seen in a thousand places.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.485
I'll take you to the dressing room.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.494
Aunt, where are you? I need to play!

33:18.538 --> 33:19.372
Aunt!

33:21.333 --> 33:25.253
-You crazy! Why didn't you use the door?
-I wasn't invited. Oh! My spine!

33:25.337 --> 33:26.838
Why didn't you give my name?

33:26.922 --> 33:30.091
Would the doorman believe,
I'm 17 like César's daughter, Cíntia?

33:30.300 --> 33:31.760
If you were 18, maybe...

33:31.843 --> 33:35.013
-Alright, aunt! Did you bring everything?
-I did, it's all here.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.682
And... this is it!

33:38.225 --> 33:41.269
-Now, your new sneakers!
-How beautiful!

33:41.353 --> 33:43.647
Because you're here to rock it, right?

33:50.237 --> 33:51.613
The main thing.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.159
Can you recognize me?

33:56.243 --> 33:59.955
If no one recognizes Superman in glasses,
no one will recognize you!

34:19.140 --> 34:22.477
César, César, the DJ has arrived.

34:22.561 --> 34:25.438
That's good! Because I couldn't reach
that moron Rafael.

34:25.522 --> 34:28.149
-Just out of area.
-And talking about morons...

34:29.067 --> 34:32.612
Helena! You came with Cíntia, my dear!
What's new?

34:32.696 --> 34:35.240
New? Just your cute attitude, chubby.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.382
Helena, I want to talk to you.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.259
-About my daughter.
-Later, César!

34:54.342 --> 34:56.595
-Now let the girl shine!
-Shine where?

34:57.804 --> 34:59.973
At the party, right? "Shine where?"

35:00.265 --> 35:02.225
Guys, what a wonderful DJ, right?

35:19.659 --> 35:22.746
Mom, the DJ has to play
a Freddy Prince song, right?

35:22.829 --> 35:25.081
-In homage to him.
-He's there, it'll be cute.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.876
You're right, girls.
I'm going to talk to her.

35:39.179 --> 35:42.724
DJ! Play a Freddy Prince song.

35:43.475 --> 35:46.519
Freddy Prince, my dear,
play one of his songs.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.597
Oh, do I need all this?

36:22.931 --> 36:26.685
You do, little cute prince.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.438
Do you hear that, Bê?

36:30.522 --> 36:32.774
All right, Freddy. Let me finish this?

36:36.069 --> 36:38.071
-Who's playing?
-I don't know.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.116
-I'll go and see.
-Are you crazy?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.493
If you go like this,
the girls will attack you.

36:44.411 --> 36:47.247
Put the mask on.
Nobody will recognize you there.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.766
What is this DJ doing to Freddy's song?

37:06.850 --> 37:09.477
Freddy's going to hate it.
What a stupid DJ!

37:09.561 --> 37:10.603
Patrícia!

37:10.687 --> 37:13.606
Mom, look at what the DJ did
to my future husband's music!

37:13.690 --> 37:15.859
-My future husband!
-Watch yourself, girl.

37:15.984 --> 37:18.278
Freddy will think it was my idea.
My life is over!

37:18.361 --> 37:19.738
What happened to this DJ?

37:27.370 --> 37:29.706
Your costume is so different.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.709
They're all dressed as princesses
and you're queen of hearts!

37:32.792 --> 37:34.085
Thanks!

37:35.879 --> 37:37.380
I like your sneakers!

37:38.047 --> 37:41.342
-Dude, your place is down there!
-I know!

37:41.426 --> 37:44.220
I came to say I love what you did
to Freddy Prince's music.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.265
I had to fix that tacky stuff, right?

37:48.516 --> 37:49.684
Tacky?

37:51.561 --> 37:53.146
You don't like Freddy Prince?

37:53.229 --> 37:55.857
I don't like corny music.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.358
Corny?

38:05.033 --> 38:08.369
You're the first girl I know
who doesn't like romantic music!

38:09.245 --> 38:11.873
I don't like anything that isn't real!

38:11.956 --> 38:13.750
-And what's love?
-An illusion!

38:13.833 --> 38:16.461
-What?
-Love is an illusion

38:16.544 --> 38:19.506
that guys like Freddy Prince use
to fool the girls.

38:19.589 --> 38:23.384
Of course not! I even believe
in love at first sight!

38:23.468 --> 38:25.512
To love a person just by looking at her?

38:25.595 --> 38:27.722
Sometimes you don't even have to look!

38:29.891 --> 38:32.852
Sometimes what the eyes don't see
the heart feels.

38:35.104 --> 38:38.650
-Isn't it the other way around?
-Not in all cases, right?

38:46.866 --> 38:49.118
Girl, what are you thinking?

38:49.202 --> 38:50.829
Freddy Prince is here!

38:51.204 --> 38:53.873
What will he say when he sees
you're destroying his music?

38:53.957 --> 38:55.875
Why destroying?
The music is great!

38:55.959 --> 38:57.919
What is this?
Who are you?

38:58.711 --> 38:59.879
I'm Freddy Prince!

39:01.297 --> 39:02.757
Wow!

39:02.841 --> 39:05.969
So you decided to surprise us!

39:06.052 --> 39:08.179
Such a nice surprise!

39:10.306 --> 39:13.101
-Freddy, it's almost midnight. Show time!
-I'm going.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.602
What's your name?

39:15.186 --> 39:17.647
Cin... Cinderella.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.858
DJ Cinderella!

39:19.941 --> 39:21.150
Cinderella?

39:21.317 --> 39:23.444
Freddy! It's time, go!

39:23.528 --> 39:25.738
It's already midnight. I have to go!

39:50.805 --> 39:55.935
<i>Freddy, I love you!</i>

39:59.230 --> 40:01.691
<i>The time everyone was waiting for!</i>

40:01.774 --> 40:03.526
Freddy!

40:04.819 --> 40:08.823
<i>With you... mine, yours,</i>
<i>the more mine than yours,</i>

40:08.907 --> 40:11.117
<i>Freddy Prince, to liven up the party!</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:19.083
<i>Good night.</i>

40:19.375 --> 40:20.418
Beautiful!

40:23.755 --> 40:28.217
<i>When one day I'll find you again</i>

40:28.635 --> 40:33.389
<i>In total danger</i>

40:33.473 --> 40:37.727
<i>Fate will reveal itself</i>

40:38.186 --> 40:40.897
<i>Come with me</i>

40:51.032 --> 40:53.242
I bet your dad thought you wouldn't come.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.161
I also thought I wasn't coming.

40:55.495 --> 40:58.414
Parties with you and my dad
don't bring me good memories.

40:58.498 --> 41:01.459
Why? He's so much better with me.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.879
An attentive wife
with daughters who respect him.

41:05.213 --> 41:07.840
-Daughters!
-They like him as a father

41:07.924 --> 41:11.302
and César also considers Graziele
and Gisele as daughters.

41:11.386 --> 41:15.431
-As long as he's sponsoring the parties.
-What are you insinuating?

41:16.099 --> 41:17.684
César!

41:17.767 --> 41:20.019
Dad is very happy you came, darling.

41:20.103 --> 41:23.231
Dad, I can't stay for long.
Tomorrow I have wake up early.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.442
But what about the show?
Don't you like Freddy Prince?

41:26.526 --> 41:28.695
She does! For sure!

41:28.820 --> 41:30.780
Good! Honey, I'm going to take this out!

41:30.863 --> 41:34.283
-No, my love! You look so handsome!
-I'm too hot. I'll be back.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.459
<i>Thanks, guys.</i>

41:44.085 --> 41:45.795
Freddy!

41:46.295 --> 41:47.296
<i>So...</i>

41:47.380 --> 41:50.800
<i>Every show, I call a girl</i>
<i>from the audience to dance with me.</i>

41:52.051 --> 41:54.804
<i>Today, I want to call a different girl.</i>

41:55.471 --> 41:57.807
<i>I don't know her face or name,</i>

41:58.349 --> 42:00.560
<i>but I know she has attitude...</i>

42:01.811 --> 42:05.356
<i>opinion and rhythm.</i>

42:06.607 --> 42:08.609
<i>I call DJ Cinderella to the stage!</i>

42:12.572 --> 42:13.656
What?

42:18.161 --> 42:21.414
Don't you dare to disguise
yourself again and go.

42:21.831 --> 42:25.918
If you do, I'll tell your father
that you were the masked DJ.

42:26.753 --> 42:29.756
Will you risk losing your secret DJ life?

42:30.173 --> 42:33.426
A father like César can destroy
your freedom

42:33.509 --> 42:36.304
and without freedom nobody can dream,
honey.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.181
You heard that! Cíntia, Cíntia!

42:38.264 --> 42:40.767
Put on the mask, Cíntia!
The boy is calling on the stage...

42:40.850 --> 42:43.686
-What's going on?
-Nothing, love.

42:43.978 --> 42:47.482
The boy called the DJ to dance
but it looks like she's gone.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.608
-Right, Helena?
-What?

42:48.816 --> 42:50.485
-Yes, she's gone.
-Yeah?

42:50.568 --> 42:52.653
Yes! She's gone and so are we.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.573
-Wait, honey...
-Leave it! Leave it.

42:55.823 --> 42:59.452
-We didn't even catch up.
-But look on the bright side.

43:00.203 --> 43:03.498
We are already starting to get along.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.583
She must have left by now.
Continue the show.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.044
It's not possible,
she must be back there.

43:10.463 --> 43:11.798
<i>Just a minute, guys.</i>

43:16.177 --> 43:19.514
<i>Just a minute, guys,</i>
<i>Freddy Prince will be back.</i>

43:28.940 --> 43:31.734
What's up?
Did you find your runaway princess?

43:33.945 --> 43:35.238
Just the sneaker.

43:40.701 --> 43:44.205
<i>When one day I'll find you again...</i>

43:44.288 --> 43:47.792
Lara, turn it off, for God's sake.
I need to focus on the subject.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.627
My scholarship depends on my grades!

43:49.710 --> 43:52.421
Wow, what a bad mood.
You're supposed to be happy.

43:52.505 --> 43:55.049
Didn't you rock it yesterday
at the party Rafa put you in?

43:55.133 --> 43:58.177
I did, actually.
That's why I need to focus here.

43:58.261 --> 43:59.720
Being a DJ is what matters.

43:59.804 --> 44:03.599
-Love only gets in the way.
-What love? What are you talking about?

44:04.475 --> 44:07.311
Your love... for Andre.
It takes your focus away.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.939
No, André doesn't take my focus away.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.816
Andre is my focus.

44:11.941 --> 44:14.610
Dating never harmed anyone.
Cíntia, are you crazy?

44:14.694 --> 44:18.072
-Really? My aunt dated a lot and...
-And what?

44:18.156 --> 44:21.409
Girl, Chicken sang so beautifully
this morning, you should've heard it.

44:21.492 --> 44:25.621
Right, momma's Chicken?
Are you there, Dog?

44:25.746 --> 44:29.750
You runaway Dog! You run from home
and spend the night meowing!

44:30.168 --> 44:32.670
Cíntia, don't forget to feed Cat,
alright?

44:32.753 --> 44:36.924
Eat everything, Cat! Kiss. Goodbye!

44:37.550 --> 44:40.595
See? Boyfriends left her like this!

44:46.225 --> 44:50.354
-Freddy Prince!
-Now I remember where I knew you.

44:50.521 --> 44:54.317
-I played in this house two years ago.
-Really?

44:54.442 --> 44:58.112
In a party that didn't end very well.

44:58.279 --> 45:02.366
For me it ended well, right?
I live here now.

45:02.575 --> 45:04.577
With César and my daughters.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.788
But to what do I owe the honor
of this visit?

45:08.039 --> 45:09.123
So...

45:09.415 --> 45:12.752
I want to know who's the DJ
who opened my show yesterday at the party.

45:14.253 --> 45:15.504
I loved her.

45:16.714 --> 45:17.548
Come with me.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.512
Here.

45:24.430 --> 45:27.433
She was the DJ.
My daughter Graziele.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.063
I met her at the party when I arrived.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.440
Beautiful.

45:35.816 --> 45:38.110
It's just that
on stage she was so different.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.279
-She had a mask, right?
-Yes!

45:40.905 --> 45:42.448
Of course.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.076
Sorry.

45:45.868 --> 45:48.412
I don't want to sound crazy, but...

45:49.372 --> 45:52.583
there on the stage,
I felt a very rare thing for her.

45:53.042 --> 45:54.085
With all due respect.

45:54.168 --> 45:58.214
I know...
Love is a rare thing indeed.

45:58.547 --> 46:02.134
Look, as a mother, I approve of it.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.887
You're such a famous boy,

46:04.971 --> 46:08.641
I mean, beautiful and romantic, right?

46:09.016 --> 46:12.228
-Fit for Graziele.
-She didn't look romantic at all.

46:12.311 --> 46:16.065
She's naughty, but sometimes
a little squeamish.

46:16.148 --> 46:17.483
We're always fighting.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.404
I'll tell you why.
Her dream is to be a DJ.

46:21.487 --> 46:24.907
Her stepfather is against it,
but I support her a lot.

46:25.032 --> 46:27.702
So I gave her the idea of playing
with a mask,

46:27.785 --> 46:29.245
so he doesn't notice, you know?

46:29.328 --> 46:31.956
But she gets nervous, poor thing.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.627
So, well, can I see your daughter?

46:40.131 --> 46:42.425
She's not at home! What a shame!

46:42.550 --> 46:45.845
But look, we'll arrange this meeting,
alright?

46:45.928 --> 46:49.015
-Not here, because of the stepfather.
-Where then? When?

46:49.098 --> 46:53.728
Relax, kid.
Leave it to me. I'll figure it out.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.187
I'm good at it.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.149
Come on! Let's stay just a bit more!

46:58.232 --> 47:00.609
Let's go! Why would I want
to see these guys?

47:00.901 --> 47:02.820
André is so awesome.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.655
Nice kick!

47:04.989 --> 47:05.865
Yeah, right!

47:07.950 --> 47:09.952
Hey, girls. Enjoying the game?

47:10.411 --> 47:11.871
You can't imagine how much!

47:11.954 --> 47:14.665
I have an invitation
you can't miss tonight.

47:14.749 --> 47:17.293
I got tickets for the Mid Night club!

47:18.002 --> 47:20.254
I loved the invitation, André!

47:20.796 --> 47:23.132
Lara, I've already told you,
you lost your shot!

47:23.841 --> 47:26.552
Well, the shots go, they come back,

47:26.635 --> 47:29.430
-they repeat themselves...
-Lara!

47:29.513 --> 47:32.183
I'd love to go, I really like
the DJ that plays there but...

47:32.266 --> 47:33.976
But she won't go alone!

47:35.102 --> 47:37.521
But if it's the four of us, she'll go.
Right, girl?

47:37.897 --> 47:40.441
-You can pick us up at seven.
-Alright then!

47:40.524 --> 47:41.942
At seven in your place, Cíntia.

47:42.401 --> 47:43.694
Kisses, girls.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.282
Thank you, girl!
Thank you for running with it!

47:49.784 --> 47:51.160
<i>Lara is so clueless.</i>

47:51.243 --> 47:54.330
Then I had no choice, right?
I'll have to go with the boy.

47:54.497 --> 47:57.500
But, on the other hand,
the nightclub is super cool,

47:57.583 --> 47:59.960
everyone goes, the best DJs play there.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.089
Aunt?

48:03.839 --> 48:05.091
Aunt Helena?

48:05.716 --> 48:07.510
Is there anyone there? Are you alright?

48:09.303 --> 48:12.306
Rafa called and told me not to meet him
in Recife.

48:13.099 --> 48:16.060
I think it's so strange.
He always wanted me to go.

48:16.602 --> 48:18.687
Well, maybe he's busy.

48:19.021 --> 48:20.231
I don't know.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.942
He's always been crazy about me.
What is this now?

48:29.615 --> 48:31.534
It's my dream to play here!

48:31.909 --> 48:34.870
What if I tell you my father owns
this place? What would you say?

48:35.204 --> 48:38.749
That it's a lie.
I know your father and the owner.

48:38.833 --> 48:42.044
I just wanted to make your dream
come true, even if it was a lie.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.505
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that,
alright?

48:45.798 --> 48:47.675
Of course I'm anxious, Bê.

48:48.050 --> 48:50.553
I'll meet the princess of my life tonight.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.012
Dude, calm down!

48:52.096 --> 48:54.765
Even romance has limits, Freddy!
What an exaggeration!

48:54.849 --> 48:56.725
-You'll see, just wait!
-Right!

48:57.017 --> 48:58.269
I'm going to get a drink, alright?

48:59.603 --> 49:02.815
-Do you want to dance, André?
-No, I'm fine.

49:02.982 --> 49:06.861
-Yeah... because I don't dance well?
-No, I'm not in the mood.

49:07.027 --> 49:10.030
To dance? Let's talk then,
I also prefer...

49:10.156 --> 49:13.951
-No, I'm not in the mood to do anything.
-Fine, I'll do nothing with you.

49:17.163 --> 49:21.083
-You have such a beautiful smile!
-Lara, do something for me.

49:21.167 --> 49:24.211
Go get us some soda.
I'll be back later, alright?

49:30.843 --> 49:33.304
Hi! Can you get me two sodas, please?

49:33.679 --> 49:35.139
-Here, lass.
-Thanks.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.311
Sorry!
I'll get another one for you.

49:41.604 --> 49:45.065
Wait! You're Belinha, from the internet!
I know your channel!

49:45.274 --> 49:48.319
What a thrill! A follower of mine!
What's your name?

49:48.402 --> 49:49.236
Lara!

49:50.029 --> 49:52.239
-Nice to meet you.
-My pleasure, Lara.

49:52.531 --> 49:55.201
So, do you agree when I say
that today's women

49:55.284 --> 49:58.537
have to value themselves,
take care of their self-esteem?

49:58.621 --> 50:00.706
Yes, of course, and I agree!

50:00.789 --> 50:04.001
I think you, as a public person,
have to open our eyes.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.294
Good to know.

50:05.794 --> 50:09.882
Sorry, but I could not help but listen
to you talking to that dude.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.260
It's André. I love him

50:13.344 --> 50:16.055
and deep down I know
he loves me too, you know?

50:16.138 --> 50:19.850
-Yeah, but do you love yourself?
-I don't understand.

50:20.184 --> 50:23.437
Alright, relax, it was just a tip.

50:23.562 --> 50:26.148
Do you want one or two sodas?

50:27.650 --> 50:29.109
Two, please.

50:30.611 --> 50:31.445
Two.

50:32.154 --> 50:35.824
Look who I brought.

50:37.117 --> 50:40.037
I'm sure you were born for one another.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.958
Go, Gisele. Go take a walk, darling.

50:44.959 --> 50:46.293
So it was you?

50:46.961 --> 50:49.380
I couldn't forget about you
since that party.

50:49.463 --> 50:53.342
Neither could I. I'm such a fan of you!

50:53.509 --> 50:56.262
Don't you think my music is tacky?

50:56.345 --> 50:59.640
-What idiot would think that?
-You.

51:00.015 --> 51:03.143
Besides me, of course!
But I was playing hard to get.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.145
I'm a huge fan of yours.

51:05.229 --> 51:09.608
-Do you have a map?
-A map? What for, boy?

51:09.692 --> 51:11.986
It's just that I got lost
in the glow of your eyes.

51:14.238 --> 51:16.782
How creative! Not!

51:16.865 --> 51:19.326
-Tell me more about you.
-What do you mean?

51:19.410 --> 51:23.664
-The things you like, I don't know!
-That's easy, I really like you.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.291
I'm a really huge fan!

51:26.000 --> 51:28.836
Do you know I'm organizing
an organ donation campaign?

51:28.961 --> 51:33.007
Seriously? That's cool! I'm surprised.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.718
So why don't give your heart to me?

51:36.343 --> 51:38.345
Girl, what can I do?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.723
You're not a neck,
but you turned my head.

51:40.806 --> 51:43.559
No! Everything has a limit. Excuse me!

51:45.811 --> 51:48.772
Are you sure you were the party DJ?

51:48.856 --> 51:53.360
I was and I'm going to be
whatever you want.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.529
I'm such a fan!

51:56.739 --> 51:59.450
Hello, everything cool?
Do you have a map?

51:59.533 --> 52:00.367
A map?

52:00.451 --> 52:02.453
It's just that I got lost
in the glow of your eyes!

52:03.412 --> 52:06.332
Wow, so original! Loved it.

52:06.415 --> 52:08.250
Excuse me, just a minute.

52:08.917 --> 52:12.630
-Something's wrong, that's not her!
-Mom, it isn't working! What do I do?

52:12.713 --> 52:15.049
Go and kiss him now!

52:25.643 --> 52:27.728
No, not again!

52:27.853 --> 52:31.315
The soda Andre asked me for.
By the way, where is he?

52:34.234 --> 52:36.195
Lara, we're leaving now!

52:42.534 --> 52:45.996
-Why did you do that?
-Because I'm your biggest fan.

52:47.289 --> 52:50.459
It's not possible!
He didn't believe she was me.

52:50.793 --> 52:53.712
-But you're not her, moron!
-Yes, I am. You're jealous!

52:53.796 --> 52:56.256
-No, you're not!
-Silence! Nobody is anything here.

52:56.507 --> 52:57.549
Except for mom.

52:58.592 --> 53:02.721
Darling, we'll figure out something
to make Freddy believe

53:02.805 --> 53:05.265
that you're his beloved DJ, alright?

53:05.349 --> 53:07.226
I don't know how, but I'll figure it out.

53:07.309 --> 53:09.478
Mom, if I don't get Freddy
I'm going to die!

53:09.770 --> 53:11.939
Is it a promise?

53:13.107 --> 53:15.776
Stop. You'll have this boy!

53:16.110 --> 53:18.153
That is a promise!

53:18.237 --> 53:21.198
I think it must be really her, Freddy.
Think with me.

53:21.740 --> 53:26.537
It's her birthday. She wanted to play
the DJ without her parents noticing.

53:26.954 --> 53:29.832
Then she put on a mask.
It makes perfect sense to me.

53:30.833 --> 53:34.795
-Why? Was the kiss so bad?
-No, that's not it. It's that...

53:35.212 --> 53:39.550
I just want to make sure it's her.
How do I make sure?

53:40.801 --> 53:45.973
Just as the prince was sure
about who Cinderella was!

53:47.891 --> 53:51.228
<i>Lost in distraction</i>

53:51.854 --> 53:56.775
<i>Feeling the breeze blowing a name</i>

53:56.942 --> 54:01.238
<i>That I can't understand</i>

54:01.905 --> 54:05.868
<i>Imagine only you</i>

54:06.201 --> 54:09.705
Rafa! You're back from traveling.
How was it?

54:09.830 --> 54:14.585
Cool. But I'm leaving.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.921
Like, for real.
I just came to say goodbye.

54:18.505 --> 54:23.719
How come? You and aunt Helena...
Is that what I'm thinking?

54:28.223 --> 54:30.267
But I have some good news for you.

54:31.059 --> 54:33.312
I got a job for you at the Mid Night club.

54:34.188 --> 54:37.649
No way! My goodness, Rafa!
I don't know how to thank you.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.611
This will help in the curriculum
for the scholarship!

54:40.694 --> 54:43.614
Look, I'm sorry for the mess
with your father's party.

54:43.822 --> 54:48.035
My bad, I'm sorry, I didn't realize...
You know sometimes I'm kind of...

54:48.118 --> 54:49.828
Dumb!

54:49.995 --> 54:53.332
I was going to say "busy." But it's fine.
"Dumb" is also good.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.085
Take care of her for me.

55:18.398 --> 55:19.233
Hello?

55:19.566 --> 55:23.111
<i>Hello, Rafael? You don't know me,</i>
<i>my name is Suelen.</i>

55:23.362 --> 55:26.824
-Smooth!
-No! It's not smooth, it's Suelen!

55:27.074 --> 55:32.663
Well, anyway, I went to a party
with my daughter and she loved the DJ.

55:33.205 --> 55:35.916
<i>The owners of the house gave me</i>
<i>your contact.</i>

55:36.041 --> 55:39.336
-Smooth.
-It's not smooth, honey, it's Suelen.

55:39.503 --> 55:43.173
Anyway, I really wanted to know
what's the next place

55:43.257 --> 55:45.634
-where this DJ will play.
-Cíntia?

55:46.051 --> 55:47.219
She rocks, right?

55:47.302 --> 55:50.222
<i>She'll play next weekend</i>
<i>at the Mid Night club.</i>

55:50.305 --> 55:52.724
-But it's for a little while!
-Because?

55:52.808 --> 55:55.894
Because she's awesome!
She got a scholarship to study in London.

55:56.645 --> 55:58.981
To see her play,
you'll have to go there. Smooth?

55:59.064 --> 56:04.236
That's more than smooth, dear.
That's very interesting.

56:04.361 --> 56:07.739
London, is it? Tell me more about it!

56:20.210 --> 56:21.753
How cute!

56:22.421 --> 56:23.922
Rafa got tired.

56:24.882 --> 56:28.093
He wanted a serious relationship,
I never corresponded.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.262
Another woman did, for sure.

56:31.013 --> 56:32.848
Love also gets tired of waiting, Cíntia.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.100
Aunt, don't be like that.

56:35.851 --> 56:37.603
-He gave it to you?
-Yeah.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.649
Since I always baptize my pets
in honor of an ex,

56:42.983 --> 56:44.943
-I'll call this one...
-DJ.

56:45.277 --> 56:47.446
It's a great name to remember Rafa.

56:47.571 --> 56:49.072
There's a better name for it.

56:50.115 --> 56:51.158
Love.

56:55.829 --> 56:56.914
<i>Love.</i>

56:57.289 --> 57:01.001
Those who know me or listen to me know
that love is my guide.

57:01.501 --> 57:03.420
And that's why I'm here on Belinha's Vlog,

57:03.503 --> 57:06.673
who is my childhood friend,
to leave a message.

57:07.257 --> 57:08.508
<i>DJ Cinderella...</i>

57:10.344 --> 57:11.720
I couldn't even say goodbye.

57:11.803 --> 57:14.848
<i>You really disappeared at 12 o'clock.</i>

57:15.807 --> 57:17.851
<i>-I hope you listened...</i>
-See that?

57:17.935 --> 57:18.977
Moron!

57:19.186 --> 57:20.562
<i>As I like yours.</i>

57:22.147 --> 57:26.318
<i>I have your crystal shoe.</i>
<i>I'll only return it personally.</i>

57:27.027 --> 57:28.904
<i>Bring the other one to complete the pair.</i>

57:29.404 --> 57:34.368
<i>On the seventh, at 2 p.m.,</i>
<i>at the Castle of Rock, where we met.</i>

57:35.202 --> 57:37.287
Confess! You're DJ Cinderella, aren't you?

57:37.704 --> 57:38.830
Keep quiet!

57:38.914 --> 57:41.083
My God!
I want to scream because I'm angry!

57:41.208 --> 57:44.336
My best friend has a romance
with Freddy Prince and I don't know?

57:44.419 --> 57:47.506
What romance, you loony?
He doesn't even know who I am.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.884
-He was kissing another girl.
-It doesn't make sense, does it?

57:50.968 --> 57:53.595
If he has another one,
why did he post a love video?

57:54.137 --> 57:55.430
It's written on his face.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.684
It's the same face André makes
when he looks at me in class.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.979
Really?
If I had doubts, they're gone now.

58:02.145 --> 58:04.940
Listen, I don't want anyone to know
about this. Or else...

58:05.023 --> 58:06.858
Or else what, stone cold heart?

58:07.150 --> 58:09.194
I'll tell André you have gum disease.

58:09.277 --> 58:10.612
-Gross!
-Cíntia.

58:11.780 --> 58:15.033
Can I have a word with you?
It's about a chat I had with your father.

58:15.117 --> 58:18.787
Darling, I can't believe
your father did something like that.

58:18.870 --> 58:22.207
Very good, right mother?
They made this exception only for me,

58:22.290 --> 58:24.126
but I have to stay away from the others.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.461
That's good, honey.

58:26.628 --> 58:28.630
Look. About what you told me,

58:28.797 --> 58:31.800
I think it's good that you're chasing
your dreams, really.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.844
But honey, don't close yourself to love.

58:33.927 --> 58:37.639
Mom, love only causes pain.
Why would I risk it?

58:37.723 --> 58:41.852
Love is a risk and you're at the age
of risking, kid.

58:41.977 --> 58:46.440
It's not because my marriage
with your father is over that I regret it.

58:46.898 --> 58:52.070
Our love has brought me much happiness.
And you're the greatest of all.

59:03.248 --> 59:06.001
-Are you crazy? Do you want to kill me?
-Don't overreact.

59:06.084 --> 59:08.128
I'm not a witch from a children's book.

59:08.336 --> 59:12.215
I come in peace. White flag. Can we talk?

59:14.509 --> 59:16.887
You don't need to treat me
as an enemy, Cíntia.

59:16.970 --> 59:19.389
Enough, alright?
You've been doing this for two years.

59:19.473 --> 59:22.267
-And don't I have my reasons?
-And I have mine, right?

59:22.350 --> 59:26.480
But that is beside the point.
What matters is that I can help you.

59:26.563 --> 59:30.150
Just as I can accidentally tell
your father

59:30.233 --> 59:32.194
you're going to play at a nightclub.

59:32.486 --> 59:35.280
-How do you know this?
-I found a way.

59:35.822 --> 59:38.450
The fact I know it changes nothing.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.202
But when your father finds out...

59:40.285 --> 59:42.579
You'd make a point of telling him,
of course.

59:42.954 --> 59:46.041
Or not. And you see,
he can even finally agree to it.

59:46.124 --> 59:48.210
He'd never agree with me being a DJ.

59:48.293 --> 59:52.923
Just as he'd never part with your mother,
he'd never let you live here...

59:53.465 --> 59:57.094
Do you see the power a woman has
over a man who is in love?

59:58.303 --> 1:00:02.349
-What's your angle, Patrícia?
-My family, that's what matters.

1:00:03.058 --> 1:00:06.478
I want peace, Cíntia,
including for you, my dear.

1:00:06.978 --> 1:00:08.730
And I can get you that.

1:00:09.439 --> 1:00:12.859
-But peace has its price, doesn't it?
-I knew it!

1:00:13.819 --> 1:00:16.822
I want the shoe that you used
at the party as a DJ.

1:00:17.489 --> 1:00:21.993
I get it! You want Graziele to say
she was the DJ at the party.

1:00:22.953 --> 1:00:25.455
I've always found you unbearable,
you know?

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:28.208
But I didn't think you were that smart.

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:32.170
Unfortunately, Graziele isn't as smart
as you.

1:00:32.337 --> 1:00:34.131
That boy is the big chance in her life.

1:00:34.214 --> 1:00:36.258
-What?
-And you must agree

1:00:36.341 --> 1:00:38.552
-you two are not a match!
-You can't know that.

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.971
Of course you can! Imagine.

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:44.391
What would a boy like that do
to your life, Cíntia?

1:00:44.474 --> 1:00:48.770
He'd mess up your goals.
Because that's what love does, baby.

1:00:49.396 --> 1:00:50.730
It blinds.

1:00:51.356 --> 1:00:54.568
You already have an example at home
with your mother, don't you?

1:01:19.801 --> 1:01:21.928
Here, isn't that what you wanted?

1:01:22.846 --> 1:01:25.015
Didn't I say you were smart?

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:29.311
You can come out now, Helena. I'm leaving!

1:01:29.561 --> 1:01:32.230
Scoot! Scoot, you buzzard!

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:37.319
Come here, Cíntia. Am I crazy
or did you give Patrícia the shoe?

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:40.322
She took the wrong shoe, aunt.

1:01:41.114 --> 1:01:44.451
So today you play in peace
without that hag blackmailing you

1:01:44.534 --> 1:01:46.870
and tomorrow you have
a chance with the stud.

1:01:46.953 --> 1:01:48.496
What a great idea, girl!

1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:51.124
So aunt, in fact, the idea wasn't mine.

1:01:51.458 --> 1:01:53.668
-Who was it then?
-It was Love's.

1:01:55.295 --> 1:01:57.714
Sweetheart, come here!

1:02:19.236 --> 1:02:20.695
This DJ is a minor.

1:02:21.321 --> 1:02:25.033
I'm her father and I demand
that she leaves immediately.

1:02:25.116 --> 1:02:28.203
-Dad, don't do this, please!
-He's already doing it, my dear.

1:02:31.581 --> 1:02:32.415
Let's go!

1:02:41.633 --> 1:02:44.594
You're not working at night like a nobody.

1:02:44.678 --> 1:02:47.681
This is the doing of Helena
and that lowlife boyfriend.

1:02:47.764 --> 1:02:51.601
Of course. From now on,
you're living with us.

1:02:51.685 --> 1:02:54.896
-You can't do that. I'll run away!
-Try.

1:02:55.146 --> 1:02:57.107
I'll denounce your aunt Helena

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:59.484
and that moron Rafael for exploiting
a minor.

1:03:00.068 --> 1:03:02.112
Is that what you want?

1:03:25.552 --> 1:03:28.638
This is your new room, Cíntia.

1:03:28.763 --> 1:03:31.057
The room is messy
because of the renovations,

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:32.559
but Patrícia will find a way.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:33.476
Super.

1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:37.105
Darling, despite it all, dad's happy
you came back to live here.

1:03:37.272 --> 1:03:39.357
From now on,
you'll have a present father.

1:03:39.482 --> 1:03:41.651
-When will you travel, dear?
-Tomorrow morning.

1:03:41.943 --> 1:03:44.529
But I'll be back soon. I mean...

1:03:45.655 --> 1:03:46.823
Well, anyway...

1:03:48.992 --> 1:03:50.660
There's bedding in the closet.

1:03:51.119 --> 1:03:54.873
-Why did you do it, Patrícia?
-I didn't mean to have you here. Promise.

1:03:55.874 --> 1:03:59.294
-Miscalculation, honey, it happens.
-So why take my father to the club?

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:01.921
To avoid the risk of Fred finding you.

1:04:02.297 --> 1:04:05.342
You're too stubborn, girl.
You were going to see him, I know.

1:04:06.092 --> 1:04:10.221
Tomorrow he becomes convinced
that Graziele was the masked DJ.

1:04:10.930 --> 1:04:13.767
I'll tell my father everything.
He'll believe me. You'll see!

1:04:14.059 --> 1:04:17.979
Let's make a bet?
Let's bet on who has more power?

1:04:18.146 --> 1:04:21.107
Let's bet, let me see... two reals.

1:04:21.191 --> 1:04:23.693
What do you think? Up for a bet?

1:04:25.403 --> 1:04:26.988
What is this? Stop!

1:04:28.198 --> 1:04:31.034
-César! César!
-Stop screaming! Are you crazy?

1:04:31.117 --> 1:04:34.454
-What are you doing?
-What's going on? What is this?

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:36.456
-César!
-What is this?

1:04:36.539 --> 1:04:39.459
César, I just asked Cíntia
if I could call her daughter.

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:41.628
I wanted to be nice, and she attacked me!

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:44.297
Dad, I didn't attack this woman,
I didn't do anything!

1:04:44.381 --> 1:04:46.549
Enough! Apologize to Patrícia.

1:04:46.633 --> 1:04:49.594
-Never!
-Daughter, you crossed the line!

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:53.098
You'll be grounded at home.
From now on, you only go to school.

1:04:53.348 --> 1:04:54.891
That's it, until you graduate.

1:04:57.185 --> 1:04:58.353
That's ridiculous!

1:05:06.486 --> 1:05:07.946
You owe me two reals.

1:05:11.533 --> 1:05:12.909
Attention!

1:05:13.451 --> 1:05:14.536
Guys!

1:05:16.246 --> 1:05:20.834
Attention, Fredylettes,
Freddyloves, Fredminions!

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:25.505
No more turmoil. Freddy's in there,
watching my live stream,

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:31.761
and when I identify the right shoe,
I'll take the princess to him. Alright?

1:05:33.638 --> 1:05:35.014
Come on!
Get out!

1:05:36.349 --> 1:05:38.143
<i>Guys, it's a riot in here.</i>

1:05:38.226 --> 1:05:42.105
-Don't jump the line!
-I'm priority, have patience.

1:05:44.607 --> 1:05:48.945
And if there's any doubt, here it is.
Proof that my daughter was the DJ!

1:05:49.028 --> 1:05:50.280
-Come!
-Come on, daughter!

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:53.450
<i>Hello, beautiful!</i>
<i>It's the owner of the party</i>

1:05:53.700 --> 1:05:55.660
where Freddy met the masked DJ

1:05:55.743 --> 1:05:58.496
and if anyone knows her true identity,
it's this woman.

1:05:58.580 --> 1:06:01.166
Sorry, but I'll have to prioritize her,
alright folks?

1:06:01.249 --> 1:06:02.667
We've been here for hours!

1:06:03.251 --> 1:06:04.669
<i>Come on, people!</i>

1:06:05.128 --> 1:06:06.421
Just a minute!

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:09.048
Guys, now is the great moment!

1:06:09.841 --> 1:06:13.303
Look, after you doubted
my daughter was speaking the truth,

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:17.348
I thought I shouldn't let
her come here and go through this.

1:06:17.724 --> 1:06:20.310
But her love moved me

1:06:20.477 --> 1:06:23.354
and I thought you deserved
this second chance.

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:25.106
Here it is!

1:06:25.607 --> 1:06:26.649
It's now, people! It's now!

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:31.529
-You're kidding, right?
-What do you mean?

1:06:32.614 --> 1:06:34.073
-That's the shoe!
-No, it's not!

1:06:34.157 --> 1:06:36.534
Of course it is, kid.
I organized the party. I know!

1:06:36.618 --> 1:06:38.995
-Guys, it's trouble!
-Tell him, Graziele.

1:06:39.078 --> 1:06:40.955
Freddy, I'm such a fan of you!

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:44.000
Okay, maybe I was wrong.

1:06:44.083 --> 1:06:45.752
She has so many shoes. You have no idea.

1:06:46.085 --> 1:06:49.172
What is this fixation for shoes?
For the love of God.

1:06:49.339 --> 1:06:52.425
Graziele is a wonderful girl.
She sings like a nightingale.

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:53.968
Sing to him, daughter. Sing!

1:06:54.636 --> 1:06:58.556
<i>When one day I'll find you again</i>

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:02.143
<i>And a chance full of infinity</i>

1:07:02.227 --> 1:07:04.479
My God!

1:07:04.562 --> 1:07:08.149
<i>It will reveal itself</i>
<i>Come with me</i>

1:07:08.608 --> 1:07:13.446
<i>-I'm going to greet the sky!</i>
-It's alright, fine. Thanks?

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:16.991
-Sorry, Freddy but...
-I know! You're a huge fan.

1:07:17.075 --> 1:07:18.201
I get it.

1:07:18.952 --> 1:07:20.995
I've always written about love and...

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:24.499
although I don't approve
of what you did...

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:27.126
now I know what it's like to be in love...

1:07:27.252 --> 1:07:28.670
and I think I understand you.

1:07:31.256 --> 1:07:32.090
How cute!

1:07:35.802 --> 1:07:37.679
Move, Graziele.
Come, girl.

1:07:37.762 --> 1:07:39.055
Come here.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:43.893
And sorry, but I need to find
my princess.

1:07:44.352 --> 1:07:45.853
Freddy, you'll be sorry!

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:48.982
-Leave it. It's over.
-It's over for you, moron!

1:07:49.107 --> 1:07:50.275
For me it's just started.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:53.486
Isn't revenge a dish you eat cold?
And so it will be!

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:56.155
Guys, what a mess!

1:07:56.781 --> 1:07:58.032
What's up, Freddy?

1:07:58.533 --> 1:07:59.492
She didn't come.

1:08:18.094 --> 1:08:21.764
-Oh, my God!
-Come on, Lara! Let me go!

1:08:24.183 --> 1:08:25.852
Girl, you don't know!

1:08:25.935 --> 1:08:28.813
I'm going to prom with André.
And what does that mean?

1:08:29.022 --> 1:08:30.398
That he had no choice?

1:08:30.648 --> 1:08:33.151
No, that he loves me, right?
I always knew that!

1:08:33.985 --> 1:08:35.570
Good for you guys then.

1:08:36.446 --> 1:08:38.489
Come on, best friend! Cheer up!

1:08:38.698 --> 1:08:42.368
I saw on Belinha's channel
that Freddy's going on a long tour.

1:08:42.619 --> 1:08:44.412
Are you trying to cheer me up, Lara?

1:08:44.495 --> 1:08:47.373
No! Before leaving,
he'll give another show

1:08:47.457 --> 1:08:51.419
on our graduation party. Which means...
you still have a chance, you silly.

1:08:51.628 --> 1:08:54.047
-Is this true?
-Truly true.

1:08:54.172 --> 1:08:56.257
If I were you,
I wouldn't wait for the party.

1:08:56.341 --> 1:08:58.468
I'd look for him and sort this mess.

1:08:58.843 --> 1:09:01.971
I'm grounded, remember?
It's from school to home and period.

1:09:02.055 --> 1:09:03.806
Even my cell phone was taken.

1:09:04.682 --> 1:09:08.186
At least I could see Patrícia
being embarrassed with the wrong shoe.

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:11.147
Yeah? And do you think
she won't take revenge?

1:09:11.481 --> 1:09:14.233
Friend, you can bet she's coming for you.

1:09:14.359 --> 1:09:16.819
What else can she do against me?

1:09:20.740 --> 1:09:21.783
Hello!

1:09:22.992 --> 1:09:24.869
Hi, darling! How are you?

1:09:27.789 --> 1:09:29.624
-Really?
-Yeah!

1:09:29.707 --> 1:09:34.212
César decided to donate
more computers to the school.

1:09:34.379 --> 1:09:36.214
I think that's great too.

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:39.967
Listen, when can I send the technician
to install the software?

1:09:40.051 --> 1:09:42.595
-I'm almost finished now.
-Good.

1:09:42.762 --> 1:09:45.098
-Will you excuse me for a minute?
-Sure.

1:09:45.181 --> 1:09:46.391
Thanks.

1:09:56.109 --> 1:09:59.237
Hello, Mrs. Patrícia?
Everything is cool.

1:09:59.487 --> 1:10:01.447
You have access to the school system!

1:10:01.531 --> 1:10:02.865
Very well!

1:10:22.844 --> 1:10:24.679
You scared me, creature!

1:10:25.596 --> 1:10:27.390
-What do you want?
-Nothing!

1:10:27.557 --> 1:10:29.809
I came to tell you daddy's here.
That's it.

1:10:29.892 --> 1:10:31.144
Fine.

1:10:33.062 --> 1:10:34.731
I so want to go to prom!

1:10:35.189 --> 1:10:38.317
-But isn't the party only for the grads?
-Grads and family.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:41.654
-We could go with Cíntia.
-I'm grounded, remember?

1:10:41.738 --> 1:10:44.407
César! Hi, my love.

1:10:45.032 --> 1:10:48.786
Cíntia has behaved so well.
It's her graduation. She has to go.

1:10:48.870 --> 1:10:50.788
Guys, I hardly have any clothes.

1:10:50.872 --> 1:10:53.040
My things stayed at aunt Helena's house.

1:10:53.124 --> 1:10:55.501
Of course you'll go
to your graduation, daughter.

1:10:55.668 --> 1:10:57.795
I don't want you to go
to your aunt's house.

1:10:57.879 --> 1:11:02.633
-But we can call a store here, right?
-I'll call and they'll bring some options.

1:11:03.050 --> 1:11:06.095
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>my little girl is graduating.</i>

1:11:09.056 --> 1:11:11.517
-What will you study now, kid?
-Thanks.

1:11:11.851 --> 1:11:16.105
So... Dad, I'm one of the best students
at school

1:11:16.189 --> 1:11:19.984
and with my grades, I want to apply
for a scholarship for a college in London.

1:11:20.067 --> 1:11:23.112
Seriously?
But what do you want to study?

1:11:24.238 --> 1:11:27.450
Musical production.
I want to be a DJ, dad.

1:11:27.533 --> 1:11:30.495
-My love, DJ?
-Dad...

1:11:30.703 --> 1:11:32.830
Being a DJ isn't just about playing
at night.

1:11:32.955 --> 1:11:35.458
Being a DJ is also producing content,
making music.

1:11:35.750 --> 1:11:37.960
And you're going to live as a DJ?

1:11:38.085 --> 1:11:40.963
Why not? So many people do.
This is my passion.

1:11:41.047 --> 1:11:44.634
You graduate and then we'll talk, alright?

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:46.344
I really liked it, dad.

1:11:46.427 --> 1:11:48.763
-It's beautiful, my love.
-It's really beautiful.

1:11:50.056 --> 1:11:51.641
A bit basic, no?

1:11:52.016 --> 1:11:54.519
But a black dress always looks good.

1:11:55.228 --> 1:11:58.105
It's a but crumpled.
Do you want me to iron it?

1:11:58.189 --> 1:12:00.149
No, I'll do it myself.

1:12:00.817 --> 1:12:05.488
Seriously, one of the best students
at school? I'm stunned!

1:12:05.738 --> 1:12:09.867
-It's the least she could do. Right, love?
-But that's a lot, César.

1:12:10.409 --> 1:12:13.204
Shall we check the grades
on the school website?

1:12:13.287 --> 1:12:15.039
Later...

1:12:15.456 --> 1:12:18.709
I want to be proud of my stepdaughter too!

1:12:41.190 --> 1:12:43.150
Gisele's coming. Come here.

1:12:44.360 --> 1:12:47.280
Call your sister.
César wants to talk to her. Go!

1:12:49.198 --> 1:12:51.075
Cíntia, dad's calling you.

1:13:07.466 --> 1:13:09.844
-Did you send for me, dad?
-No, daughter.

1:13:09.927 --> 1:13:11.470
Yes, you did, César.

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:14.974
We wanted to check Cíntia's grades
on the school website.

1:13:15.057 --> 1:13:16.767
The bulletin hasn't come out yet!

1:13:16.851 --> 1:13:19.770
I think it has. I'm dying
to see how the girls are doing.

1:13:20.897 --> 1:13:24.984
I'm worried about Gisele, my love.
Here. Check it out.

1:13:26.027 --> 1:13:29.530
Cíntia! You failed in two subjects?

1:13:29.614 --> 1:13:32.533
Are you kidding, dad?
My grades are great, I know that!

1:13:32.617 --> 1:13:35.202
-Great?
-Five in Geography,

1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:37.455
four and a half in History?

1:13:37.580 --> 1:13:39.749
Look, I don't know what's your concept
of great.

1:13:39.832 --> 1:13:42.168
-That doesn't make sense!
-It kind of does.

1:13:42.251 --> 1:13:45.296
It must be hard to study by day
and work at night.

1:13:45.379 --> 1:13:48.424
-No! This isn't right!
-Stop being a liar, Cíntia!

1:13:48.549 --> 1:13:49.926
-But...
-It's too much to discover

1:13:50.009 --> 1:13:52.261
my daughter will repeat
the year on prom day!

1:13:52.345 --> 1:13:53.596
Dad, I'm not a liar.

1:13:53.679 --> 1:13:55.473
-You're not a liar?
-César, calm down!

1:13:55.556 --> 1:13:58.059
Probably she meant
to tell you after the party.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:13:59.894
-No!
-That's the point!

1:14:00.269 --> 1:14:03.689
For you, it's all partying.
You're ill accustomed.

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.983
Your princess life is over!

1:14:06.067 --> 1:14:07.401
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

1:14:11.155 --> 1:14:12.990
My dress!

1:14:13.074 --> 1:14:16.410
-You rascal!
-Me? What do I have to do with it?

1:14:16.494 --> 1:14:19.497
-Do you see, César, how she treats me?
-Daughter! Hold on!

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:22.416
Are you crazy?
Patrícia was with us all the time!

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:24.418
Cíntia, you must have left it!

1:14:24.502 --> 1:14:26.837
You viper! Liar! I'll end you!

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:30.883
Daughter, stop it! Come here with me!

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:37.682
Father, you must believe me, please.

1:14:37.765 --> 1:14:41.644
-I barely recognize you lately!
-You really don't know me, dad!

1:14:41.727 --> 1:14:43.729
-You're going to get grounded.
-What?

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:46.816
The worst is that I still have to go
to this party, for the girls.

1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:49.735
We'll have a serious chat later.
You and me!

1:14:59.203 --> 1:15:02.581
You messed up Graziele's dream
without any consideration.

1:15:02.957 --> 1:15:05.042
Was it so hard to be more generous?

1:15:06.252 --> 1:15:09.296
You gave me the wrong shoe
and thought I'd leave it alone.

1:15:10.423 --> 1:15:12.049
Payback can be really cruel, dear!

1:15:23.227 --> 1:15:24.979
André, pick it up!

1:15:45.458 --> 1:15:46.542
Pick it up.

1:15:51.922 --> 1:15:52.757
Hello.

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:56.469
-Cíntia, I need to talk to Cíntia.
-Make some sense, honey.

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:58.888
It's not the time of the day
to call homes.

1:15:58.971 --> 1:16:01.640
Please, I need to talk to my friend.

1:16:01.724 --> 1:16:04.935
Cíntia is grounded, my dear.
For an indefinite period.

1:16:05.019 --> 1:16:08.022
Look, you better get
another friend, alright? Kiss!

1:16:11.358 --> 1:16:13.819
Selling something at this hour,
do you believe it?

1:16:13.944 --> 1:16:15.404
-Did you buy it?
-Of course not!

1:16:22.536 --> 1:16:27.124
<i>Lost in distraction</i>

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:30.628
<i>Feeling the breeze</i>

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:33.464
<i>Blowing a name</i>

1:16:33.547 --> 1:16:39.220
<i>That I can't understand</i>

1:16:39.512 --> 1:16:42.431
I'm going to miss you so much
when you go on tour.

1:16:45.101 --> 1:16:46.435
I'm happy with the tour.

1:16:49.647 --> 1:16:52.316
But I can't stop thinking
about DJ Cinderella.

1:16:53.734 --> 1:16:54.777
It's difficult.

1:16:55.069 --> 1:16:56.904
Look, Freddy, for real...

1:16:57.279 --> 1:17:01.200
I think you need to wake up.
If she didn't show up, it's because...

1:17:16.173 --> 1:17:17.299
Ouch!

1:17:22.179 --> 1:17:23.347
<i>Cíntia!</i>

1:17:24.723 --> 1:17:25.850
<i>Cíntia!</i>

1:17:26.267 --> 1:17:27.560
<i>Cíntia!</i>

1:17:28.644 --> 1:17:29.812
Aunt!

1:17:29.979 --> 1:17:33.732
-Aunt, the door is locked!
-Here, child! Right here, behind you!

1:17:34.275 --> 1:17:37.862
Come on, let's go!
Rhythm, DJ! Help me here!

1:17:43.742 --> 1:17:45.369
There you go!

1:17:45.494 --> 1:17:47.705
I came to rescue you.
Your friend called.

1:17:47.788 --> 1:17:50.916
-You have to go to this prom.
-How? I don't even have clothes!

1:17:51.292 --> 1:17:54.003
Your aunt godmother has
it all figured out, my dear.

1:17:54.086 --> 1:17:57.006
-Here's your little dress!
-This dress?

1:17:57.089 --> 1:17:58.883
It's all we got! Be grateful!

1:17:58.966 --> 1:18:01.552
The last time I wore
this dress was two years ago

1:18:01.635 --> 1:18:04.471
at my parents' wedding party.
Do you know what that means?

1:18:04.555 --> 1:18:06.015
That it's kind of musty, right?

1:18:06.348 --> 1:18:08.434
-But the smell isn't bad.
-No, aunt!

1:18:08.517 --> 1:18:10.311
I was a fool who believed in love.

1:18:10.477 --> 1:18:14.899
After everything I went through,
I'll just dress up and chase a boy?

1:18:14.982 --> 1:18:18.194
You can do anything you want.
The question is: What do you want?

1:18:32.458 --> 1:18:33.667
Friend!

1:18:35.211 --> 1:18:37.421
-You're so beautiful!
-Thanks.

1:18:37.504 --> 1:18:39.465
-Did you bring the mask?
-I did!

1:18:39.548 --> 1:18:41.550
I brought a mask, and I brought a shoe.

1:18:41.634 --> 1:18:43.552
Everything that got them together.

1:18:43.636 --> 1:18:45.888
I won't fool you.
There's a mega security scheme.

1:18:45.971 --> 1:18:50.059
-No one's getting near the dressing room.
-What if I play? Will he hear me?

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:53.729
-Good! Great!
-Yeah, you at least still have hope.

1:18:53.812 --> 1:18:55.731
My friend, how are you?

1:18:56.398 --> 1:18:59.902
Angry at that Camila Abrantes.
She ruined my chance with André.

1:18:59.985 --> 1:19:02.071
But why hate this girl?

1:19:02.154 --> 1:19:04.740
-André invited you to prom.
-No, we won't hate today!

1:19:04.823 --> 1:19:07.243
Let's dance, enjoy,

1:19:07.534 --> 1:19:11.789
and in our case, Larinha,
forget that men exist.

1:19:13.374 --> 1:19:17.127
Wait, is Rafa here?
With another one?

1:19:19.421 --> 1:19:20.256
I'm going after her!

1:19:24.635 --> 1:19:26.595
-The clowning's over!
-Helena?

1:19:26.679 --> 1:19:28.180
Listen here, you fool.

1:19:28.472 --> 1:19:30.474
I've never needed a man in my life

1:19:30.557 --> 1:19:33.727
until you showed up with a puppy
called Love and got me disturbed.

1:19:33.811 --> 1:19:35.854
-What?
-Was I wrong? Yes!

1:19:35.938 --> 1:19:39.066
But it was my way of loving.
You should have straightened me up,

1:19:39.149 --> 1:19:40.818
not dumped me for another one.

1:19:40.901 --> 1:19:42.695
I won't have it!

1:19:42.778 --> 1:19:46.407
Listen here, sweetheart,
pay attention and see if you understand.

1:19:52.079 --> 1:19:53.956
Got it? Or do you want me to draw it?

1:19:54.039 --> 1:19:56.667
-I'll put that shoe in your face.
-Helena.

1:19:56.750 --> 1:19:58.377
-Scoot out of here!
-Helena!

1:19:58.460 --> 1:20:01.088
Helena, easy!
I don't have another woman!

1:20:01.171 --> 1:20:03.841
-Right! And who is she, punk?
-I don't know, never seen her.

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:07.303
Poor girl! Girl, I'm sorry!

1:20:08.887 --> 1:20:11.098
Rafa, I love you! Come back?

1:20:11.181 --> 1:20:13.684
Do I have a choice?
I love you too, my softie.

1:20:16.603 --> 1:20:18.731
I'm glad you got along.

1:20:19.606 --> 1:20:22.484
Cíntia! I like the mask!

1:20:22.609 --> 1:20:27.114
Then take your place, DJ Cinderella,
and attract your prince!

1:20:28.157 --> 1:20:30.117
-What? I don't get it.
-I'll explain.

1:20:30.200 --> 1:20:31.618
Come, switch places, come!

1:20:36.707 --> 1:20:38.959
Intern school would be great for Cíntia.

1:20:39.043 --> 1:20:43.505
It would free her from the influences
of her aunt and Rafael.

1:20:43.589 --> 1:20:46.550
-I have doubts...
-Hi. Let me introduce you. This is Diego.

1:20:47.009 --> 1:20:49.345
Is everything alright, Diego?
Excuse me.

1:20:50.095 --> 1:20:53.474
-Am I wrong or you're...
-Mom, we're getting to know each other.

1:20:53.557 --> 1:20:56.727
-Is he rich, famous, something like that?
-He's a normal boy!

1:20:56.810 --> 1:20:59.480
What else could I expect from you?

1:20:59.563 --> 1:21:01.732
A lowlife always looks for another one!

1:21:01.815 --> 1:21:04.735
-Mom!
-Truth hurts but strengthens, daughter.

1:21:05.069 --> 1:21:06.236
Come on, Diego.

1:21:06.779 --> 1:21:11.158
Mom... again this horrible version
of Freddy's song?

1:21:20.376 --> 1:21:22.127
Thought I'd never see you again.

1:21:24.046 --> 1:21:26.382
Freddy! I really wanted to meet you!

1:21:26.465 --> 1:21:29.843
I saw your calling on the internet.
I mean, I don't follow you,

1:21:29.927 --> 1:21:31.970
-but my friend Lara...
-No need to explain.

1:21:32.346 --> 1:21:33.680
You made that clear.

1:21:33.764 --> 1:21:38.018
You said you didn't like Freddy Prince,
that his songs were corny.

1:21:38.310 --> 1:21:40.687
Love is an illusion. I was right.

1:21:41.605 --> 1:21:44.108
-I was just another one.
-Not! That isn't it!

1:21:44.191 --> 1:21:46.819
-You're getting it all wrong.
-You know, I believed

1:21:46.902 --> 1:21:49.696
I'd find someone
that really cared about me,

1:21:50.114 --> 1:21:52.825
independently of fame or name.

1:21:53.117 --> 1:21:53.951
And then...

1:21:55.994 --> 1:21:58.414
when I finally found
what I was looking for...

1:21:59.039 --> 1:22:02.126
-you didn't feel the same for me.
-But that's not it, listen to me!

1:22:02.209 --> 1:22:06.130
Forget it. It's over.
I'm not going to play the clown anymore.

1:22:09.216 --> 1:22:12.177
<i>Beautiful people,</i>
<i>it's the last opportunity</i>

1:22:12.261 --> 1:22:14.930
<i>to see Freddy playing in town</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

1:22:15.013 --> 1:22:18.517
<i>So enjoy mine, yours,</i>

1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:22.020
<i>more mine than yours, Freddy Prince!</i>

1:22:23.605 --> 1:22:27.901
<i>When one day I'll find you again</i>

1:22:28.402 --> 1:22:32.698
<i>In total danger</i>

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:37.536
<i>Fate will reveal itself</i>

1:22:37.995 --> 1:22:40.747
<i>Come with me</i>

1:22:50.215 --> 1:22:51.758
Let's take a selfie here.

1:22:51.842 --> 1:22:53.469
-Now with a kiss.
-You know...

1:22:53.552 --> 1:22:56.096
-I want to see Freddy.
-No, this Freddy is awful.

1:22:56.180 --> 1:23:00.684
André, what awful is spending my prom
with a boring guy like you. Excuse me.

1:23:08.025 --> 1:23:08.984
What's up, Lara?

1:23:09.568 --> 1:23:11.987
Look, my bad for leaving you by yourself.

1:23:12.446 --> 1:23:14.948
The good news is you got another shot.

1:23:15.032 --> 1:23:17.576
If you want to be with me,
this is the time.

1:23:17.659 --> 1:23:19.328
Really, André?

1:23:19.828 --> 1:23:22.414
I'm not another one in your contact list.

1:23:22.498 --> 1:23:24.875
-So you'd rather be here alone?
-Who said she was alone?

1:23:25.167 --> 1:23:27.544
-Belinha from the internet?
-In the flesh, bone

1:23:27.628 --> 1:23:29.963
and two million followers.
Is he bothering you?

1:23:30.130 --> 1:23:32.049
No, this one doesn't bother me anymore.

1:23:32.382 --> 1:23:34.384
Your shot's gone, right, André?

1:23:38.305 --> 1:23:41.975
I'm very proud of you, girl.
You did very well.

1:23:42.267 --> 1:23:43.393
Clown.

1:23:43.602 --> 1:23:46.647
I wish I'd taken a photo
of his face at that moment!

1:23:46.813 --> 1:23:47.940
It's you!

1:23:48.690 --> 1:23:51.360
Look, I think I know
this girl from somewhere.

1:23:51.610 --> 1:23:54.029
This is Cíntia, my best friend.

1:23:54.404 --> 1:23:55.906
She's the DJ who was playing now.

1:23:55.989 --> 1:23:58.283
You didn't recognize her
because of her mask.

1:24:10.337 --> 1:24:12.464
Freddy!

1:24:13.590 --> 1:24:16.218
I found out who your princess is.

1:24:19.471 --> 1:24:22.641
-She doesn't want anything to do with me.
-Why are men so dumb?

1:24:22.724 --> 1:24:24.101
I've figured it out, listen.

1:24:26.687 --> 1:24:29.565
Cíntia!
Calm down, girl! Calm down!

1:24:29.815 --> 1:24:32.985
-You can't leave now!
-I have nothing else to do here.

1:24:33.652 --> 1:24:35.779
If my father sees me,
I'll be dead.

1:24:35.904 --> 1:24:37.406
No, you won't leave!

1:24:38.824 --> 1:24:41.326
<i>I always do this part of the show </i>
<i>more towards the end,</i>

1:24:41.410 --> 1:24:44.204
<i>but the girl that I want to call</i>
<i>to dance with me</i>

1:24:44.288 --> 1:24:47.040
<i>has the strange tendency to disappear.</i>

1:24:47.124 --> 1:24:48.500
My heart will explode!

1:24:48.584 --> 1:24:52.713
<i>To this day I didn't know her name</i>
<i>and I didn't know her face either</i>

1:24:52.796 --> 1:24:56.133
<i>or at least I thought not...</i>

1:24:56.216 --> 1:25:00.721
<i>because I discovered that it's</i>
<i>the same face I dreamt with for years.</i>

1:25:00.804 --> 1:25:02.931
<i>-You have to go up there!</i>
-My father can't know!

1:25:03.015 --> 1:25:04.850
-Now, everything I want...
-I can't!

1:25:05.976 --> 1:25:08.520
<i>Is that you give me</i>
<i>the honor of this dance...</i>

1:25:09.146 --> 1:25:11.273
<i>-Cíntia Dorella.</i>
-Too late.

1:25:37.799 --> 1:25:39.051
She won't dance.

1:25:40.093 --> 1:25:41.595
She won't dance.

1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:46.224
I'm responsible for Cíntia
and she wasn't allowed to be here.

1:25:47.392 --> 1:25:48.894
Get your hands off of Cíntia!

1:25:50.187 --> 1:25:53.106
Mom! I don't believe!

1:25:53.231 --> 1:25:56.026
Daughter, I asked your aunt
to keep it a secret

1:25:56.109 --> 1:25:58.403
because I wanted to be here for your prom.

1:25:58.945 --> 1:26:01.657
She's my daughter,
she has my authorization.

1:26:02.157 --> 1:26:04.534
Ana, dear, sorry to disturb this moment

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.703
but Cíntia didn't graduate.

1:26:06.787 --> 1:26:10.749
César grounded her
because she failed. Right, honey?

1:26:11.166 --> 1:26:13.126
Impossible.
Cíntia is the best student in class!

1:26:13.210 --> 1:26:16.338
-How come, César?
-Unfortunately, it's true, Anna.

1:26:17.172 --> 1:26:19.966
Mother, confess!
You've changed Cíntia's grades.

1:26:20.050 --> 1:26:22.010
I saw you fiddling with the school system.

1:26:22.761 --> 1:26:25.722
-What on earth, Patrícia?
-No! She's nuts.

1:26:25.889 --> 1:26:27.933
She's crazy. Did you go insane?

1:26:28.016 --> 1:26:31.353
That's right, mother!
Truth hurts but strengthens, doesn't it?

1:26:31.770 --> 1:26:36.525
<i>People, Cíntia has</i>
<i>more than enough to graduate.</i>

1:26:36.608 --> 1:26:40.320
<i>So let's continue the party</i>
<i>and we can sort that out later.</i>

1:26:40.404 --> 1:26:44.157
-César, my love, I can explain.
-Let's go.

1:26:44.241 --> 1:26:47.119
The girl isn't well, she needs therapy.

1:26:49.579 --> 1:26:50.706
Go there.

1:26:51.123 --> 1:26:52.165
Go.

1:27:01.842 --> 1:27:03.093
So it was you.

1:27:26.825 --> 1:27:30.203
<i>Lost in distraction</i>

1:27:30.996 --> 1:27:35.792
<i>Feeling the breeze blowing a name</i>

1:27:35.959 --> 1:27:40.046
<i>That I can't understand</i>

1:27:40.881 --> 1:27:44.718
<i>Imagine only you</i>

1:27:46.136 --> 1:27:50.015
<i>I'm looking for the first track</i>

1:27:50.307 --> 1:27:53.810
<i>I find only this tone</i>

1:27:55.312 --> 1:27:58.607
<i>I expect some syllable</i>

1:27:59.232 --> 1:28:03.862
<i>But nothing's done I only hear the breeze</i>

1:28:04.279 --> 1:28:08.325
<i>Love at first sight</i>

1:28:08.492 --> 1:28:12.621
<i>The dream awakened me</i>

1:28:13.205 --> 1:28:19.377
<i>Your heart is my sound</i>

1:28:22.297 --> 1:28:26.301
<i>Love at first sight</i>

1:28:26.802 --> 1:28:32.557
<i>Your heart is my sound</i>

1:28:35.268 --> 1:28:37.687
<i>And that's how our story started, people.</i>

1:28:37.771 --> 1:28:40.565
<i>And, with ours, new stories also started.</i>

1:28:41.274 --> 1:28:42.108
Good!

1:28:44.861 --> 1:28:46.613
<i>Gisele has changed a lot.</i>

1:28:46.780 --> 1:28:48.657
You should call yourself Marv, girl.

1:28:48.740 --> 1:28:51.034
-Why Marv?
-Because you look marvelous.

1:28:51.326 --> 1:28:54.496
<i>And Graziele?</i>
<i>She hasn't changed at all.</i>

1:28:54.579 --> 1:28:58.291
You want to go out with me?
Graziele, you've never looked at my face.

1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:01.461
But that was before you turned
into a famous YouTuber. Now?

1:29:01.628 --> 1:29:04.256
-Now I'm a super fan of you.
-Really?

1:29:05.090 --> 1:29:08.093
Girls, does anyone want
to go out with me today?

1:29:08.218 --> 1:29:09.845
-I do!
-I do!

1:29:09.928 --> 1:29:12.639
See? Now it's too late.
You've lost your shot.

1:29:13.473 --> 1:29:16.560
-Wasn't that my phrase?
-What do you want, boy?

1:29:16.685 --> 1:29:17.727
A chance.

1:29:17.811 --> 1:29:19.896
What do I need
to get your attention, Graziele?

1:29:20.230 --> 1:29:24.359
Success! Is that the case? Then scoot!

1:29:25.026 --> 1:29:27.612
<i>-Aunt Helena and Rafa are super happy,</i>
-Goodbye, my Love!

1:29:27.696 --> 1:29:29.531
<i>and the puppy Love made his own puppies.</i>

1:29:29.614 --> 1:29:30.866
Don't forget to bathe Love.

1:29:30.949 --> 1:29:35.328
-Don't forget the bath salts for Joy.
-Cool, my soft little thing.

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:42.127
<i>Patrícia? She left her daughters</i>
<i>with my father</i>

1:29:42.210 --> 1:29:44.462
<i>and went back to her home.</i>

1:29:44.546 --> 1:29:48.842
Mother, look here,
I left everything clean for you.

1:29:48.925 --> 1:29:50.260
Why all the ass-kissing?

1:29:50.343 --> 1:29:53.054
Am I telling you to increase my allowance,

1:29:53.138 --> 1:29:55.849
and stop being stingy
because I deserve more money?

1:29:56.266 --> 1:29:58.310
-Am I saying that?
-You wouldn't dare!

1:29:58.393 --> 1:30:00.437
Because I won't raise a penny!

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:02.939
And do me the favor of fixing the toilet!

1:30:03.023 --> 1:30:06.902
It's clogged again
and it keeps overflowing!

1:30:06.985 --> 1:30:09.738
It's very dirty. Go, toughen up!

1:30:09.821 --> 1:30:13.199
And do it right, because I'll check.
Do you understand me?

1:30:13.325 --> 1:30:15.660
If she's happy,
that's another story, right?

1:30:15.827 --> 1:30:16.828
I know we are.

1:30:16.912 --> 1:30:19.414
You can tell by your passionate faces.

1:30:19.664 --> 1:30:22.542
-And London, did you like it?
-Dude, it was awesome!

1:30:22.834 --> 1:30:26.087
That's where we started playing together.
Anyway...

1:30:26.171 --> 1:30:28.632
-You already know the rest.
-Romantic pop

1:30:28.715 --> 1:30:31.092
with an electronic beat. It became a hit.

1:30:31.176 --> 1:30:32.385
And...

1:30:33.345 --> 1:30:34.346
Cut!

1:30:40.268 --> 1:30:45.690
<i>She danced smiling</i>
<i>Different, a DJ pop star</i>

1:30:46.274 --> 1:30:51.529
<i>He was an irreverent prince</i>
<i>Suddenly saw everything change</i>

1:30:52.072 --> 1:30:57.577
<i>And now where are you?</i>
<i>I tried but don't know where to find</i>

1:30:57.661 --> 1:31:03.959
<i>I look everywhere on the street</i>
<i>And beyond</i>

1:31:04.042 --> 1:31:09.714
<i>He was an inconsequential prince</i>
<i>By accident he looked at her</i>

1:31:09.798 --> 1:31:15.595
<i>She enjoyed a teen pop without worries</i>
<i>He was enchanted</i>

1:31:15.845 --> 1:31:21.768
<i>And now where are you?</i>
<i>In my dream you continue to dance</i>

1:31:21.851 --> 1:31:28.024
<i>In this rhythm I want to play, honey</i>

1:31:34.239 --> 1:31:36.741
<i>Now I just want to love you</i>

1:31:36.825 --> 1:31:39.828
<i>I've found you</i>
<i>And I'll never leave you again</i>

1:31:39.911 --> 1:31:43.123
<i>Your rhythm I'll follow my honey</i>

1:31:43.206 --> 1:31:47.544
<i>My love, my darling</i>
