I'll fucking kill you.

Why does he hate you so much?

00:22.959 --> 00:25.083

12:35.250 --> 12:37.083
Thank you.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.500
Thank you.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.959
♪ ♪

13:07.834 --> 13:09.917
(ship horn blows in distance)

13:12.792 --> 13:14.875
You picked him up at Walpole?

13:14.959 --> 13:16.875
Yeah. Drove him over
to St. Mary's.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.333
He didn't say a word
the entire way.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.458
He'd just, you know,
look out the window.

13:21.542 --> 13:24.417
He went inside?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.583
Yeah, he was in there--

13:26.667 --> 13:29.792
I don't know--
five minutes, tops.

13:29.875 --> 13:33.625
Come out. I drove him over
to a motel on Western Avenue.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.500
You know he killed a priest.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.667
Did you talk to the police?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.375
What the fuck business
do I got talking

13:41.458 --> 13:42.166
to the cops about anything?

13:42.250 --> 13:45.458
(coughs)

13:45.542 --> 13:48.125
I could make it
your business.

13:49.917 --> 13:52.166
Nah. They might think that...

13:52.250 --> 13:55.250
I knew what he was planning
to do.

13:55.333 --> 13:58.083
That-that would make me
an accomplice.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.417
(chuckles)

13:59.500 --> 14:01.834
Why should I take
that kind of risk?

14:23.583 --> 14:25.542
You know, you talk funny.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.083
Where were you born?

14:29.166 --> 14:32.250
You don't want to know.

14:34.417 --> 14:37.291
Better?

14:37.375 --> 14:39.458
It's okay.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.125
The drugs
will kick in any sec.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.750
Did I do this to you?

14:48.834 --> 14:50.709
That's all I
want to know.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.709
That last fight
in Worcester--

14:52.792 --> 14:53.792
pretty rough,
you took a lot of punches.

14:53.875 --> 14:57.291
Did I keep you
in the game too long?

14:57.375 --> 14:58.750
'Cause if I did, give me a gun.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.583
Blow my brains out right now.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.709
It's all right, Mick.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.834
I don't know.
Maybe I did this.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.458
No one knows
what causes it.

15:06.542 --> 15:07.750
There's lots of factors.

15:07.834 --> 15:10.542
Oh, all right, good.

15:10.625 --> 15:13.041
Makes jerking off easier, right?

15:14.333 --> 15:15.333
Can we have
a minute alone?

15:15.417 --> 15:18.417
Sure.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.250
I don't want
to be a third wheel.

15:27.375 --> 15:30.166
(Mickey sighs)
(door shuts)

15:30.250 --> 15:32.834
Is he for real?

15:32.917 --> 15:35.083
He's all right.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.041
How's that?
Is that better?

15:40.166 --> 15:41.792
I'm sorry about the mess.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.500
Oh. (chuckles)
I've seen worse.

15:44.583 --> 15:48.500
Yeah?
Sure.

15:48.583 --> 15:52.625
You know, I used to be a hooker
before I was a nurse.

15:53.959 --> 15:56.041
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.

15:56.125 --> 15:57.750
(chuckles)

15:57.834 --> 16:01.500
Someone's got to mean a lot,
I guess, if you're gonna...

16:01.583 --> 16:04.166
wear her name
on your body forever.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.458
Unless you were drunk
when you got it.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.792
I wasn't drunk.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.667
I'm feeling better.

16:11.750 --> 16:14.375
What do I owe you?

16:14.458 --> 16:15.542
Oh, nothing.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.583
Your brother
took care of it.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.667
I'm not a charity case.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.583
You're done here, right?

16:22.667 --> 16:24.375
Yeah.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.792
I'm done.

16:30.959 --> 16:33.375
(exhales)

16:33.458 --> 16:36.583
Yeah. Okay.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.917
I'll see you then.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.166
He okay?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.500
He's hurting, but it'll ease up.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.667
Your brother's
a stubborn bastard.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.917
He's a good guy, though.
The best.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.083
Thanks for the cash.
I can use it.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.125
No problem.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.417
I moved the lawyer
to this afternoon.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.709
Why don't you come with me?

17:00.792 --> 17:02.166
We can hang out
till the appointment.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.000
It's dirty money, Ray, you know?

17:05.083 --> 17:07.542
The church is going broke
with all these lawsuits.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.709
(sniffles)

17:09.792 --> 17:12.083
Who put that crap in your head?

17:12.166 --> 17:14.375
(door shuts)

17:16.041 --> 17:19.000
MICKEY:
Ray Ray.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.250
You hear this one?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.291
There's the...

17:23.375 --> 17:24.709
there's the half nelson.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.500
See? Like that.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.959
There's the full nelson.

17:28.041 --> 17:30.625
And there's
the Father Nelson.

17:30.709 --> 17:33.458
(chuckles)

17:33.542 --> 17:35.625
You think that's funny?

17:35.709 --> 17:38.792
You take life
too fucking serious, Ray.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.875
Smile and the world
smiles with you.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.625
Cry and you cry alone.

17:42.709 --> 17:45.625
Speaking of priests...

17:45.709 --> 17:47.000
you killed the wrong one, Mick.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.000
What are you
talking about?

17:49.083 --> 17:51.834
The priest that
molested Bunchy?

17:51.917 --> 17:55.750
They moved him out
of that parish ten years ago.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.291
(snorts, chuckles)

18:01.375 --> 18:03.583
You killed his brother,
you moron.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.583
So what?

18:08.667 --> 18:11.875
He didn't fuck my boy,
he fucked someone else's.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.208
Let's go.

18:16.834 --> 18:20.166
(mumbling):
Look...

18:20.250 --> 18:21.834
I-I got my SNAP meeting.

18:23.959 --> 18:27.000
Dad's...
coming with me.

18:29.041 --> 18:32.250
You know how many times I
asked you to come with me, Ray?

18:32.333 --> 18:36.500
I got to support my kid.
That's what fathers are for.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.709
EZRA:
It's a groundbreaking
celebration!

18:47.792 --> 18:49.709
I want little shovels!

18:49.792 --> 18:52.709
Is that too much to ask?

18:52.792 --> 18:55.333
Raymond, shut the door.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.709
What's going on, Ezra?

19:03.792 --> 19:05.750
The golem's arrived.

19:06.834 --> 19:09.333
Uh-huh.

19:11.041 --> 19:14.959
Listen, Ezra...

19:15.041 --> 19:18.125
I think we should make
an appointment with a doctor.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.375
Are you sick?

19:21.917 --> 19:24.375
Your father called three times.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.375
You didn't talk to him, did you?

19:26.458 --> 19:28.291
Do you think I'm crazy?
I thought we took care of him.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.709
All right. Calm down.
I am taking care of it.

19:31.792 --> 19:32.959
How?

19:33.041 --> 19:34.458
Better if you don't know.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.083
(hip-hop music playing)
Take it out.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.667
I'm gonna give you the best
hand job of your life.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.291
You know how long I've been
trying to sign this guy?

19:39.375 --> 19:40.333
Who?

19:40.417 --> 19:42.041
Re-Kon!

19:42.125 --> 19:43.583
Four DUIs last year.

19:43.667 --> 19:47.041
Two months ago, he tried to go
through L.A.X. with an Uzi.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.333
An Uzi.

19:48.417 --> 19:50.083
Three record companies
are suing him.

19:50.166 --> 19:53.083
The hours we can bill!
And his little protégé?

19:53.166 --> 19:54.750
Gonna be the black
Justin Bieber.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.417
Word.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.333
Oh, one problem.

20:00.417 --> 20:02.041
We got to get total control,
all parental rights.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.834
So, Ray, you got to buy the kid.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.500
We're buying kids now, Lee?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.667
We've done worse.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.000
(door shuts)

20:11.083 --> 20:12.917
This is my legacy, Raymond.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.083
My tribute to Ruth.

20:14.166 --> 20:17.250
Your father's
going to ruin it.

20:19.709 --> 20:20.208
I became withdrawn.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.458
I quit all my sports.

20:22.542 --> 20:25.375
I was a, uh, 12-year-old
with post-traumatic stress

20:25.458 --> 20:27.625
and they just didn't notice?

20:27.709 --> 20:29.458
Bullshit. They noticed.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.291
They were just too damn afraid
to do anything about it.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.875
Afraid of the priest,
afraid of their...

20:35.959 --> 20:37.959
beloved holy Catholic Church,

20:38.041 --> 20:40.834
afraid of the
fucking Pope.

20:41.542 --> 20:44.250
So they just let it happen.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.542
(voice cracking):
They just fucking let it happen.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.875
I'm sorry.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.834
Wow.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.834
God bless you.

20:58.709 --> 21:00.834
You was all abused?
All of you?

21:00.917 --> 21:02.458
Ain't that something, huh?

21:05.625 --> 21:07.000
We got to lighten
things up around here.

21:07.083 --> 21:10.333
Come on.
(claps)

21:10.417 --> 21:12.291
Bunch of sad sacks.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.834
Okay. Here's one for you.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.125
Guy comes home from work

21:18.208 --> 21:21.000
and finds that his girlfriend
is packing to leave.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.667
She's upset about something.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.875
And he says, uh, "Honey,
what's wrong?" And she says,

21:25.959 --> 21:29.250
"Today I found out
you're a pedophile."

21:29.333 --> 21:30.333
He says, "Pedophile?

21:30.417 --> 21:33.458
Whoa, that's a big word
for an eight-year-old."

21:35.792 --> 21:38.041
(Mickey laughs)

21:40.333 --> 21:41.625
(light chuckling)

21:44.500 --> 21:45.000
MICKEY:
Yeah, you get it.

21:45.083 --> 21:48.709
Yeah.
(chuckles)

21:48.792 --> 21:51.041
Well...
(chuckles)

21:51.125 --> 21:54.166
who's next?

21:54.250 --> 21:55.750
LENA (over phone):
Yo. Where you headed?

21:55.834 --> 21:57.041
Compton.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.375
What's in Compton?

21:58.458 --> 21:59.792
Someone's mother.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.291
Hey, Lena, you know that,
uh, rapper, my neighbor?

22:01.375 --> 22:04.333
I want you to check him out.
Yeah. Re-Kon.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.500
See if he's ever had sex
with a minor.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.250
Hurt a kid, anything like that.

22:08.333 --> 22:09.542
You hear from Avi?

22:09.625 --> 22:11.041
Yeah, he says
the guy's playing games,

22:11.125 --> 22:12.375
but he'll probably do it
for more money.

22:12.458 --> 22:13.208
Tell him to do
whatever it takes.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.375
(line beeps)
I got another call.

22:17.709 --> 22:19.041
Yeah, Terry, what's up?

22:19.125 --> 22:20.041
How's the arm?

22:20.125 --> 22:21.625
The arm's fine.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.125
I'm gonna pay you back.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.125
For what?

22:24.208 --> 22:25.709
That nurse, the medicine.

22:25.792 --> 22:27.750
Christ, Ter, you want
to pay me back? Call her.

22:27.834 --> 22:30.083
She likes you.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.000
MAN:
Is there anger inside?

22:34.083 --> 22:37.083
Disappointment?

22:37.917 --> 22:41.750
Inhale deeply.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.834
Gather that anger,
and when you exhale,

22:43.917 --> 22:45.583
just let it go.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.125
(deep exhale)

22:47.208 --> 22:49.208
Very good, very good.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.750
Surrender to the ground.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.000
Inhale again.

22:53.083 --> 22:56.291
Gather that anger.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.250
And when you exhale,
just let it go.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.333
(exhales)

23:01.417 --> 23:02.792
Very good.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.959
(crying)

23:05.041 --> 23:07.458
(mutters quietly)

23:07.542 --> 23:07.959
Let it go.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.500
Let it go, Abby.

23:10.583 --> 23:12.583
Let it go.

23:12.667 --> 23:15.208
Send those negative thoughts
to the universe.

23:15.291 --> 23:15.709
Don't forget to exhale.

23:15.792 --> 23:18.792
Breathe.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.542
Good.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.583
Very good.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.083
(inhales deeply)

23:26.166 --> 23:28.625
(exhales)
There we go.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.500
(whispers):
I'm a terrible person.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.291
No, no. This is about
breathing. No talking, okay?

23:33.375 --> 23:35.333
I'm spiteful.
It's not...

23:35.417 --> 23:39.792
This is about letting go.
Just let go.

23:39.875 --> 23:42.792
Good. Good.

23:43.125 --> 23:47.083
Good.

23:47.166 --> 23:49.083
(shuddering breath)

23:49.166 --> 23:50.375
Oh, relax.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.834
No, stay-stay down.
Stay down.

23:52.917 --> 23:53.875
Stay down.
I'm sorry.

23:53.959 --> 23:56.583
Good.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.834
I'm sorry...
No, no, no. Just relax.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.834
You need to relax into the pose.
I...

24:00.917 --> 24:01.834
I have to go!

24:01.917 --> 24:03.458
Okay.

24:03.542 --> 24:07.041
Shavasana, everybody.
Shavasana.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.625
Relax.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.458
When I woke up...

24:11.542 --> 24:15.041
I realized I'd been...

24:15.125 --> 24:17.959
orally raped.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.166
Oh, boy.

24:21.250 --> 24:24.250
I could use
some oral rape right now.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.417
(sniffs, sighs)

24:29.625 --> 24:30.875
What the fuck?!

24:30.959 --> 24:34.500
Sir. Sir.

24:34.583 --> 24:35.959
It's time for you to leave.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.542
I couldn't agree with you more.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.667
We're out of here, Bunch.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.917
All right.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.667
All right,
all right, you stay.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.500
This is your thing.

24:51.583 --> 24:54.000
I got some...
stuff to do.

24:54.083 --> 24:55.917
And I'll catch up
with you later.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.083
(sighs)

24:59.166 --> 25:01.667
What they done to you all,

25:01.750 --> 25:05.750
every last one of them
should burn in hell, all right?

25:10.625 --> 25:12.542
Keep in touch.

25:12.625 --> 25:13.709
You can find me
at Terry Donovan's Fite Club.

25:13.792 --> 25:17.083
Come in there.
We'll put some gloves on you,

25:17.166 --> 25:19.417
toughen you up a little.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.125
(door shuts)

25:24.208 --> 25:25.542
(sighs)

25:25.625 --> 25:27.792
How you doing today, Bunchy?

25:28.208 --> 25:32.583
Not so good.

25:32.667 --> 25:35.000
(cries)

25:35.083 --> 25:37.250
I'm sorry.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.250
Big day for you, right?

25:39.333 --> 25:41.583
You're picking up your check
from the diocese.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.583
Supposed to.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.875
And, uh, how do you feel
about that?

25:57.834 --> 26:00.834
(cell phone ringing)

26:00.917 --> 26:01.458
Hey, sweetheart.

26:01.542 --> 26:03.625
BRIDGET:
Hey, Daddy.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.125
How was your day?

26:05.208 --> 26:06.625
Okay. Kind of boring, actually.

26:06.709 --> 26:07.792
How's yours?

26:07.875 --> 26:09.375
Nothing special so far.

26:09.458 --> 26:11.250
What's your brother up to?

26:11.333 --> 26:13.000
Soccer practice.
(hip-hop music playing)

26:13.083 --> 26:15.166
Daddy...

26:15.250 --> 26:17.375
when are you coming home?

26:18.458 --> 26:20.166
Soon.

26:20.250 --> 26:22.917
Tonight?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.333
Soon, sweetheart.

26:27.291 --> 26:29.625
I love you.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.166
Listen, honey, I got to go.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.583
Love you.
Hey!

26:34.667 --> 26:38.125
(sighs)
You in the jean shorts.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.333
Get your sweet ass over here.

26:44.917 --> 26:46.125
You know I'm talking to you.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.834
What's your name?

26:48.917 --> 26:50.375
Bridget Donovan.
Mmm.

26:50.458 --> 26:51.750
What's your name?

26:51.834 --> 26:53.500
Marvin Gaye.
Marvin Gaye Washington.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.709
Hey, you want to hear
some sweet shit?

26:59.125 --> 27:00.959
Sure.

27:02.875 --> 27:06.542
It's very nice to meet you,
Marvin Gaye Washington.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.083
Marvin Gaye...
pause...

27:09.166 --> 27:10.834
Washington. Got it.
Washington. That's right.

27:10.917 --> 27:14.166
WOMAN:
I'm just supposed to hand
my kid over to someone?

27:14.250 --> 27:17.083
'Cause he rich?

27:17.166 --> 27:19.208
Famous?

27:19.291 --> 27:21.208
Not care what happen?

27:21.291 --> 27:23.875
I know you care.

27:23.959 --> 27:25.792
He kidnapped my boy.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.208
I should get
the law on him.

27:28.291 --> 27:29.875
Maybe you should.

27:29.959 --> 27:31.125
Get a lawyer.

27:31.208 --> 27:32.250
Do something about it.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.291
Get my boy back.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.375
Marvin get his talent
from me.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.917
Tell him about 'Retha.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.166
WOMAN:
I sang backup
for Aretha.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.542
She was old then,
but it was still Aretha.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.917
Even wrote a little
on one of her records.

27:49.166 --> 27:52.792
Did studio stuff
for Mary J. Blige, too.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.417
I got paid
good money for that.

28:13.834 --> 28:15.709
You work?

28:15.792 --> 28:17.458
How I'm supposed to work?

28:17.542 --> 28:19.333
I been sick.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.458
Real sick.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.083
I'm just saying...

28:32.583 --> 28:35.125
...asking someone to...

28:35.208 --> 28:37.750

28:39.333 --> 28:42.500
...even a lot
of money...

28:43.709 --> 28:46.834
I don't even know how something
like that gets arranged.

28:48.417 --> 28:50.458
Signature on a piece of paper.

28:50.542 --> 28:51.834
When you're ready.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.834
I'm deep in my addiction now.

29:00.542 --> 29:04.417
How can I raise a child?

29:24.583 --> 29:25.500
Excuse me.

29:25.583 --> 29:28.333
Those suits...
Uh...

29:28.417 --> 29:30.834
I haven't priced these yet.
Are you interested?

29:30.917 --> 29:32.000
Well, they're...
Actually, they're mine.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.542
Well, somebody donated these
this morning.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.542
It was me. I brought
them in this morning.

29:37.625 --> 29:39.333
It was an accident.
I'll-I'll just take them back.

29:39.417 --> 29:41.375
You can't do that.

29:41.458 --> 29:42.709
MAN:
What's going on?

29:42.792 --> 29:44.333
Well, uh...
MAN:
Oh.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.625
Hello again.
Uh, this woman wants
to take these suits.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.542
She says...
They're hers.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.834
I was here this morning
when she dropped them off.

29:51.917 --> 29:55.625
When you left, I assumed
you made a mistake.

29:55.709 --> 29:58.208
Here.

29:58.291 --> 29:59.417
They're yours.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.875
Thank you, Father.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.792
Thank you.

30:05.875 --> 30:07.709
Um...

30:16.583 --> 30:18.583
This is $2,000 or $3,000.

30:48.208 --> 30:49.750
Get off.

30:49.834 --> 30:51.000

EZRA:
Who is this?!

32:18.125 --> 32:22.500
Brown boy from Compton,
used to be coppin'.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.583
Now I'm pimped out.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.583
That's what it's about.

32:26.667 --> 32:29.834
Re-Kon's sellin' my story,
that's the glory.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.625
I got a story.

32:32.709 --> 32:36.458
Yeah, I got a story.

32:36.542 --> 32:38.792
You like it?
(giggles)
Yeah, I like it.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.291
Badass, right?
How do you come
up with it?

32:41.375 --> 32:42.792
That's my talent.

32:42.875 --> 32:44.750
And what I see
inspires me.

32:44.834 --> 32:47.125
All the crazy fuckers
in my neighborhood?

32:47.208 --> 32:48.542
(exhales)

32:48.625 --> 32:51.083
Everyone got to be
inspired by his life.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.834
Well, my life's not
inspiring; it's boring.

32:53.917 --> 32:54.875
You buggin'.

32:54.959 --> 32:57.250
Living here?
(door opens)

32:57.333 --> 32:58.750
Hi, Mom.

32:58.834 --> 33:00.959
This is Marvin
from down the street.

33:01.041 --> 33:03.041
Hi.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.542
Um, Bridg, you want to help me
with this stuff?

33:05.625 --> 33:06.875
I'll get it!

33:06.959 --> 33:08.709
No, it's fine.
It's done.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.375
(quietly):
You think that's
a good idea?
What?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.792
Inviting some strange kid into
the house when nobody's home?

33:14.875 --> 33:16.625
I was home.
You know what I mean.

33:16.709 --> 33:18.667
He's a neighbor,
and he's nice.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.041
He lives in that house

33:20.125 --> 33:23.041
where they play
all that music all the time.

33:23.125 --> 33:26.542
Mom... he's nice.

33:27.917 --> 33:29.667
Are you and Dad fighting?

33:29.750 --> 33:32.250
Why?

33:32.333 --> 33:34.208
He doesn't sleep
here anymore.

33:36.750 --> 33:39.083
He stays in his apartment...

33:39.166 --> 33:39.792
for business.

33:39.875 --> 33:41.917
That's what he says.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.667
Bridget, you give me
a break.

33:44.750 --> 33:48.291
(chuckles)

33:49.625 --> 33:51.625
Thank you.

33:51.709 --> 33:53.375
Sure.

33:55.542 --> 33:58.041
(sighs)

34:02.166 --> 34:03.417
Are you hungry?

34:03.500 --> 34:06.041
Hell, yeah.

34:08.041 --> 34:09.959
(Bridget chuckles)

34:10.041 --> 34:12.333
MAN:
This is a check
from the diocese

34:12.417 --> 34:16.625
for your settlement
of $1.4 million.

34:16.709 --> 34:19.542
And this is a durable
power of attorney form.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.625
It authorizes
your brother

34:21.709 --> 34:24.875
to make decisions for you
regarding your finances.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.458
What's that mean?

34:29.542 --> 34:30.625
It means I'm
gonna help you.

34:30.709 --> 34:33.125
Help me what?

34:33.208 --> 34:34.542
You're in a slip, Bunch.

34:34.625 --> 34:37.125
You think I can't take care
of myself?

34:38.709 --> 34:42.000
Do I have to sign that form
to get the check?

34:43.959 --> 34:46.583
No, it's... it's yours.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.709
Good.

34:51.792 --> 34:53.792
Bunch, wait.

34:54.917 --> 34:58.208
Would you mind?
Sure.

35:02.166 --> 35:05.875
(door opens, closes)

35:06.583 --> 35:08.333
What the fuck are you doing?

35:08.417 --> 35:09.959
You treat me like a kid.
You are a kid.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.333
I'm fucking 40 years old, Ray!

35:12.417 --> 35:14.667
You can't handle $1.4 million.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.417
How do you know?
When's the last time

35:16.500 --> 35:17.667
you had a job
for more than a week?

35:17.750 --> 35:20.500
I have issues!

35:20.583 --> 35:22.166
I know you do.
That's why I'm trying to help.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.750
Well, maybe I don't need
your help no more.

35:25.834 --> 35:29.166
'Cause of him? Huh?

35:29.250 --> 35:32.792
(snorts) You think
he's gonna look after you?

35:32.875 --> 35:34.083
Huh?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.375
I'm gonna look after him.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.083
Fuck, Bunch, what the fuck
are you talking about?

35:39.166 --> 35:39.834
We owe him something.

35:39.917 --> 35:42.750
We owe him nothing.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.375
Did you beat up Daryll?

35:45.458 --> 35:46.041
No.

35:46.125 --> 35:49.625
I had someone else do it.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.750
You want to know why? Ask Mick.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.375
He says you sent him to prison.

35:55.458 --> 35:56.667
Bunch...
Did you?

35:56.750 --> 35:58.000
Come on, Bunch.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.625
Let's put this money
somewhere safe.

35:59.709 --> 36:00.875
Make sure you're all right.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.208
He says you framed him.

36:02.291 --> 36:03.750
Bunch, please.
Come on.

36:04.834 --> 36:06.125
Let me help you.

36:06.208 --> 36:11.000
I'm doing this
for your own good, I swear.

36:16.125 --> 36:18.667
(door opens)

36:20.166 --> 36:21.959
(softly):
"...Queequeg had handled

36:24.500 --> 36:28.709
"all hands were in a panic;
and to attempt snatching

36:28.792 --> 36:32.583

seemed madness."

36:32.667 --> 36:34.333
The whale wins.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.875
Who the fuck are you?

36:39.959 --> 36:43.208
I'm the guy
that got you out of prison.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.417
I got myself out of prison.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.333
You were supposed
to do five more years.

36:52.291 --> 36:55.250
What are you? FBI?

36:58.709 --> 37:00.792
You know how many punks
would have wanted

37:00.875 --> 37:03.959
to kill me in Walpole if they
knew what I fed you people?

37:04.041 --> 37:06.875
Practically shit myself
every time I took a shower.

37:06.959 --> 37:09.458
I gave you Sully's gang.
What the fuck else do you want?

37:09.542 --> 37:12.834
You didn't give us Sully.
He's still out there.

37:12.917 --> 37:16.041
The guy's a fucking Houdini.
What can I do?

37:16.125 --> 37:19.000
Anyways... that's the past.

37:19.083 --> 37:21.834
I got a new life now.

37:21.917 --> 37:24.500
I know.

37:24.583 --> 37:26.709
You've been busy.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.834
What do you want?

37:47.041 --> 37:50.458
I'll let you know.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.750
This ain't enough.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.750
More next time.

37:57.834 --> 38:00.041
(laughs)

38:00.125 --> 38:00.750
I'll be in touch.

38:00.834 --> 38:03.291
Take care, Mick.

38:06.166 --> 38:08.083
(exhales sharply)

38:09.542 --> 38:11.583
(phone rings)

38:15.625 --> 38:18.083
Hey, Avi, what's up? Are we on?

38:18.166 --> 38:21.709
Yeah. He'll I.D. Mickey
for 50 K.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.125
Do it.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.208
It's a lot of cash. Boss?

38:29.291 --> 38:31.208
I need to know
the minute it's done.

38:31.291 --> 38:34.542
Okay, you got it.
Got another call.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.041
Yeah, Lena, what's up?

38:36.125 --> 38:37.333
Okay, Re-Kon's checked out.
Your meet's set.

38:37.417 --> 38:40.917
I'll see you outside
Ezra's party.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.709
(knocking)

38:51.792 --> 38:52.792
BRIDGET:
Mom?

38:52.875 --> 38:55.166
Uh-huh?

38:55.250 --> 38:57.709
Uh, there's a limo downstairs.

38:57.792 --> 38:58.959
A limo?

38:59.041 --> 39:01.083
With a driver.

39:01.166 --> 39:03.291
Daddy sent it for you.

39:03.917 --> 39:06.375

39:42.875 --> 39:45.166
All right.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.041
So, what you think, Ray?

39:54.125 --> 39:55.333
Think I'm gonna get the kid?

39:55.417 --> 39:56.792
Got to sort

Done.

40:27.083 --> 40:28.000
You keep him away from drugs.

40:28.083 --> 40:31.125
Drugs, yeah, (chuckles)
but not the reefer.

40:31.208 --> 40:33.333
Artists can't create
without the reefer, baby.

40:33.417 --> 40:35.500
Drugs.

40:35.583 --> 40:35.875
(sighs)

40:35.959 --> 40:38.208
All right.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.750
You make sure no one

40:41.834 --> 40:43.375
You understand me?
Oh, man.

40:43.458 --> 40:45.083
I don't even get down
in that type of scene.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.083
You kidding me?

40:46.166 --> 40:47.125
Yo, I love the kids.

40:47.208 --> 40:50.000
Shit, I got my own foundation.

40:51.542 --> 40:53.500
All right.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.625
Drexler will call you.

40:57.375 --> 40:59.667

Whoa, hold up.
Yo, we straight, right?

41:05.333 --> 41:06.959
Like, I mean, I ain't got

41:07.041 --> 41:09.000
to worry about her
changing her mind?

41:09.083 --> 41:12.458
She won't change her mind.

41:13.625 --> 41:16.083
Hey, Ray,
thank you, thank you.

41:16.166 --> 41:16.709
(sighs)

41:26.959 --> 41:29.166
Ray!

41:30.583 --> 41:32.041
Hey, how are you?

41:32.125 --> 41:33.709
I'm okay.

41:33.792 --> 41:34.333
Where's Ezra?

41:34.417 --> 41:37.834
Praying at the shrine.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.583
Excuse me.

41:44.083 --> 41:46.542
Ezra.

41:46.625 --> 41:49.125
Oyf farshemen zikh.

41:50.166 --> 41:52.625
You all right?

41:53.291 --> 41:56.166
Mickey called me.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.625
You told me
to trust you.

41:57.709 --> 42:00.083
This is great, Ezra.
A real tribute to Ruth.

42:00.166 --> 42:00.917
I'm literally
moved to tears.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.375
Ray, Hanukah
with the crack mom?

42:03.458 --> 42:05.792
Are we gonna make
my new homey client happy?

42:05.875 --> 42:09.041
Why don't you go
get a drink, Lee?

42:12.917 --> 42:15.041
I meant what I said, Ezra.

42:15.125 --> 42:17.083
You can trust me.

42:19.959 --> 42:20.709
I do.

42:41.875 --> 42:43.125
You showed up.

42:43.208 --> 42:45.500
Did I have any choice?

42:46.750 --> 42:48.875
A fucking limo? (chuckles)

42:48.959 --> 42:50.125
Driver?

42:50.208 --> 42:52.542
Don't start. Come on.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.458
You look nice.

42:56.542 --> 42:58.834
Thank you.

42:59.875 --> 43:01.667
(applause)

43:06.250 --> 43:10.417
Welcome! Welcome.

43:10.500 --> 43:13.583
Tonight is a blessing.

43:13.667 --> 43:16.583
Next week, we break ground

43:16.667 --> 43:20.166
for the Ruth Goldman
Ovarian Cancer Center.

43:23.750 --> 43:26.625
Paying tribute to Ruth.

43:26.709 --> 43:28.500
She was a wonderful woman.

43:28.583 --> 43:29.917
(chuckling):
Yeah, wonderful.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.125
I often felt
that she was an angel.

43:33.208 --> 43:37.000
Angel? Do you want
to know about Ruth?

43:37.083 --> 43:38.542
She was so giving, so generous.

43:38.625 --> 43:41.000
Ruth the saint,
Ruth the holy.

43:41.083 --> 43:42.250
Deb, hi.

43:42.333 --> 43:43.500
EZRA:
She loved everyone.

43:43.583 --> 43:44.750
Let's get some air.

43:44.834 --> 43:46.041
She was no angel, believe me.

43:46.125 --> 43:47.083
She was sleeping
with her shrink for years.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.542
There was nothing
she wouldn't do for anyone.

43:49.625 --> 43:52.041
Years!

43:52.125 --> 43:55.041
I see this center as my legacy.

43:55.125 --> 43:58.166
Ruth would want that.

44:06.250 --> 44:09.709
A legacy...

44:09.792 --> 44:12.041
is important.

44:12.125 --> 44:15.333
Especially when you've done
terrible things.

44:15.417 --> 44:18.667
Not to be spoken of.

44:18.750 --> 44:23.875
There's a price to pay
for the wrong that we do.

44:23.959 --> 44:25.709
A terrible...

44:25.792 --> 44:27.959
price.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.000
Baruch attah Adonai...

44:35.250 --> 44:36.917

44:42.792 --> 44:44.458

44:44.542 --> 44:46.875
Thanks for your support.

44:46.959 --> 44:48.000
What a great night.

44:56.291 --> 44:59.041
(Deb sighs)

44:59.125 --> 45:01.542
(Deb retching)

45:01.625 --> 45:03.542
Oh, God.
Come here.

45:03.625 --> 45:06.000
I made such a fool of myself.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.834
No, it's all right.
Wipe your face.

45:10.250 --> 45:13.500
(food sizzling,
low indistinct conversations)

45:14.333 --> 45:15.917
(bell dings twice)

45:20.375 --> 45:23.000
(low conversations)

45:26.041 --> 45:28.792
I just want to say
I gave Ray the money.

45:28.875 --> 45:30.583
Nobody pays for me--
I pay for myself.

45:30.667 --> 45:33.917
Just want to
make that clear.

45:34.000 --> 45:34.875
Hello to you, too.

45:36.709 --> 45:37.875
Hello.

45:39.583 --> 45:43.125
So, this is about the money?

45:43.208 --> 45:45.959
I don't know.

45:46.041 --> 45:46.917
It's what it is.

45:49.041 --> 45:52.792
That's a nice shirt
for a business transaction.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.000
I'm a clean man.

45:56.917 --> 45:59.417
This isn't how it's done.

45:59.500 --> 46:00.500
What?

46:00.583 --> 46:02.875
Asking someone for a date.

46:02.959 --> 46:04.375
This isn't
how you do it.

46:04.458 --> 46:05.917
Fine.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.542
(short laugh)

46:13.875 --> 46:15.083
You like spaghetti?

46:15.166 --> 46:16.625
Sure.

46:16.709 --> 46:18.375
Good.

46:22.208 --> 46:24.041
(laughs)

46:27.083 --> 46:29.083
(Ray sighs)

46:30.458 --> 46:32.792
(phone rings)

46:35.458 --> 46:36.709
Yeah, Avi?

46:36.792 --> 46:38.083
Yeah, it's done.

46:38.166 --> 46:40.208
Your father's getting sent back
to prison.

46:40.291 --> 46:41.875
They took his statement?

46:41.959 --> 46:44.709
Yeah. They want him to come back
in a couple of days,

46:44.792 --> 46:47.709
look at photos,
but it's... happening.

46:47.792 --> 46:49.000
Thanks.

46:49.083 --> 46:50.917
No problem.

46:55.166 --> 46:57.125
(sighs)

47:13.125 --> 47:14.375
Bunch?

47:14.458 --> 47:15.709
(door closes)

47:15.792 --> 47:17.250
Come on out here, Bunch.

47:17.333 --> 47:18.375
We got company. Come on.

47:18.458 --> 47:20.625
Come on.

47:21.834 --> 47:23.500
Right this way.

47:23.583 --> 47:27.125
You lovely ladies, uh,
know how to twerk?

47:27.208 --> 47:28.834
Yeah, sure we do.
Of course.

47:28.917 --> 47:29.417
MICKEY:
Let's see.

47:29.500 --> 47:33.041
Whoa-ho-ho... Bunch?

47:33.125 --> 47:34.250
This is my son, Bunchy.

47:34.333 --> 47:35.875
Bunch.
Hey, Bunch.
Hi, Bunchy.

47:35.959 --> 47:37.917
Show him a little
twerk, Cinderella.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.542
She's an artist who
makes you the hardest.

47:40.625 --> 47:43.625
(both laughing)

47:43.709 --> 47:45.834
He'll warm up.
He'll warm up.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.083
This is a gymnasium.
