WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.253
- In accordance
with the authority

00:03.336 --> 00:04.254
vested in this Council
by the Realm,

00:04.337 --> 00:07.382
we hereby sentence you,
Emma Alonso,

00:07.465 --> 00:10.093
to have your powers stripped
at the completion of this spell.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.596
- You too, Lily?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.807
I'm not surprised those two
would try something like this.

00:15.890 --> 00:16.933
They've done it before.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.935
But I thought you were
on my side.

00:19.018 --> 00:21.146
- I am on your side, Emma,
but you're out of control.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.273
You know, this doesn't
have to be permanent.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.942
Just until you can show
you can handle your powers.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.610
- Oh, I can handle them.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.487
I can more than handle them.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.197
- Try telling that
to the pool.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.327
LILY: She's out of control,
a threat to us all.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.037
- Thus we ask
this grim recall.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.874
- For all the days
and all the hours...

00:40.957 --> 00:43.918
- Take from this one
all her powers.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.588
- Quick, Emma,
get out of here!

00:49.048 --> 00:51.426
- Treachery, treason,
betrayal, shame,

00:51.509 --> 00:53.553
return this spell
whence it came.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.975
- No!
You didn't!

00:59.058 --> 01:00.560
- Wait--
what just happened?

01:00.643 --> 01:03.688
- Reflection Spell?

01:03.772 --> 01:04.813
That's extremely advanced!

01:04.897 --> 01:07.025
How did you--
- A little help from <i> Hex.</i>

01:07.108 --> 01:08.318
- What did you do?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.528
- Our powers!
How dare you?

01:10.612 --> 01:12.864
- Don't worry.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.533
This doesn't
have to be permanent.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.243
But it could be.

{\an8}Where did you learn
a Reflection Spell?

01:54.697 --> 01:55.698
{\an8}-<i> Hex.</i>

01:55.782 --> 01:58.034
{\an8}- I really should start
reading more books.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.327
{\an8}I'll put that in my notes.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.915
"Tell Jax Jr.
to read more books."

02:03.998 --> 02:05.834
- Do you think
I went too far?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.086
- No. I don't think
you went far enough.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.963
I think you should've turned
them into caterpillars

02:10.045 --> 02:12.382
and put them right in
the middle of Highway A1A.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.219
- Hey, did you talk to Jessie
about moving in with your mom?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.262
- I couldn't.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.556
When I got home,
she wasn't there.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.641
Neither was Dad.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.476
- What?
Where did they go?

02:23.560 --> 02:24.561
- I don't know.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.895
Dad has houses
all over the world.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.021
He could be anywhere.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.023
- Are you gonna look for her?
- Yeah.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.109
I mean, she might be
an annoying pest,

02:31.192 --> 02:34.112
but she's <i> my</i>
annoying pest.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.199
- I'm bored.
What's the point

02:38.283 --> 02:40.410
of coming all the way
to Australia

02:40.493 --> 02:41.578
if we're gonna just
sit here all day?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.955
- Just need to make sure
that you're safe.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.373
- Safe?
Safe from what?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.709
You keep telling me what
a powerful wizard you are.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.086
You can protect us.

02:50.169 --> 02:53.089
Come on, I want to see
koalas and kangaroos and...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.257
Tasmanian devils!

02:54.340 --> 02:57.385
- Those animals can be
quite aggressive.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.012
But how about...

03:00.555 --> 03:03.349
- Aww, he's so cute!

03:03.433 --> 03:04.350
What is he?

03:04.434 --> 03:06.269
Can we keep him?
Please?

03:06.352 --> 03:09.022
- Well, it's called a sugar
glider, and we'll see.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.274
But for now,
you can play with him.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.651
- Hi, Mr. Sugar Glider.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.445
Or are you a Miss?
A Mrs?

03:15.528 --> 03:16.946
I'll call you "Mugsy"

03:17.030 --> 03:18.615
'cause that works for a girl,
or a boy, like Jessie!

03:18.698 --> 03:20.700
- Steven!

03:20.783 --> 03:22.327
How many times
do I have to tell you?

03:22.410 --> 03:26.039
We do not put emojis
in our spreadsheets!

03:26.122 --> 03:28.166
- How 'bout a selfie
sesh, Mugsy?

03:30.752 --> 03:31.836
- Hey, how's it coming?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.964
Any progress?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.591
- Progress on what?

03:36.674 --> 03:37.717
- Getting me back
to my other life.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.928
The Everglades?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.346
- Oh, right.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.057
No, not yet, but that
was only yesterday.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.266
I haven't done anything yet.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.852
I've got a ton
of stuff going on.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.021
But it's second on
my to-do list.

03:50.104 --> 03:50.813
Right under "eat lunch."

03:50.897 --> 03:53.274
- Oh.
Good.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.154
- I'm gonna do it.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.865
- Right.
Carry on.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.795
- Agamemnon?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.718
Hey, Aggie!
Your shoelaces are untied.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.761
- I know.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.388
I'm still learning
how to tie them!

04:23.471 --> 04:26.391
The bunny going
'round the tree...

04:26.474 --> 04:28.977
Oh, it's just
so complex!

04:30.895 --> 04:32.730
[text alert]

04:36.985 --> 04:38.319
- Jessie!

04:38.403 --> 04:39.570
"Hey big bro, I can't tell you
where I am right now.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.740
"I just wanted to
let you know that I'm okay

04:42.824 --> 04:44.033
"and that I miss you.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.034
XO, Jessie."

04:50.415 --> 04:51.749
- Where have you been?

04:51.833 --> 04:53.042
- Oh, with nurse Lily.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.252
I think it's
safe to say

04:54.335 --> 04:56.879
you're officially off of
her Christmas card list.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.714
Which is too bad 'cause her
cards are always so cool.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.882
- Why?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.759
I didn't take
any powers from her.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.220
- That's not really
the point.

05:04.303 --> 05:06.639
She was your
biggest fan--

05:06.723 --> 05:07.640
Second biggest fan.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.559
She always supported you
in the Council.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.769
- [scoffs]
You call that support?

05:11.853 --> 05:14.605
Getting in
on the, the...

05:14.689 --> 05:15.940
Triangle of Traitors?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.650
- "Secret of the Triad".

05:17.734 --> 05:19.819
Although your version of it
does have a better ring to it.

05:19.902 --> 05:24.741
Look, I know what the Council
did might seem a little drastic,

05:24.824 --> 05:26.075
but they're still
the Council--

05:26.159 --> 05:28.911
- And I'm still
the Chosen One!

05:28.995 --> 05:30.747
Last time I checked.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.623
- Dude, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

05:32.707 --> 05:33.583
but I think it might
have been better

05:33.666 --> 05:35.168
if they did take
your powers away.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.627
- What?
- Not forever!

05:36.711 --> 05:40.089
Just 'til you've had
some time to simmer down.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.932
[intercom beeps]

05:50.016 --> 05:50.933
- Yes?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.226

05:52.310 --> 05:53.936

05:54.020 --> 05:55.021
- Thank you, Steven.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.440
I'll be back shortly.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.650
You need anything?
You hungry?

05:59.734 --> 06:00.860
- I'm okay, thanks.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.529
- [speaking Korean]

06:12.163 --> 06:13.289
- Come on, we're going
back to Miami.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.332
- Yes!
It's so boring here

06:14.415 --> 06:17.210
just
sitting and watching Dad work.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.712
But Mugs is cute,
though.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.797
Come on, Mugs,
let's go.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.923
- There's not
enough time.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.844
- [speaking Korean]

06:35.353 --> 06:36.854
- Look, Em, no one thinks
having magic powers

06:36.938 --> 06:41.442
is cooler than I do, but when
you really get down to it,

06:41.526 --> 06:42.944
you don't need them.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.362
I mean, not on
a daily basis.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.572
- You didn't object
when I used them

06:46.656 --> 06:48.616
to turn a certain video game
zombie into a real boy.

06:48.699 --> 06:49.826
- What?
Don't bring Phillip into this!

06:49.909 --> 06:50.827
- I know.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.329
Sorry.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.791
And I know lately with my magic
I've been going a little...

06:56.874 --> 06:57.333
- Nutty?
Over the top?

06:57.416 --> 06:58.793
To Crazytown?

06:58.876 --> 07:01.129
- A little far.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.381
But I didn't ask to be
the Chosen One.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.382
The Realm gave
me a lot of power

07:04.465 --> 07:07.760
and I need to know
how to use it.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.345
- That is true.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.514
- If that means getting
a little out of hand,

07:11.597 --> 07:15.393
isn't it better that I learn
now than when it really matters?

07:15.476 --> 07:17.979
- So what you're saying is
you're just testing out

07:18.062 --> 07:19.438
the limits of your powers,

07:19.522 --> 07:22.859
like taking them on a test drive
at 200 miles per hour?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.277
- Exactly.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.612
- But you're not gonna do
anything crazy with them.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.655
- Crazy?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.282
No.

07:29.365 --> 07:30.491
- Oh.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.701
Okay, well...

07:31.784 --> 07:32.952
Just be careful then.

07:33.035 --> 07:33.452
- Of course.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.623
- That felt so weird
just now.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.708
"Be careful."

07:38.791 --> 07:39.709
Who am I?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.586
- You're my
best friend...

07:41.669 --> 07:43.421
Who gets to eat
all my fries.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.839
- No way!

07:44.922 --> 07:46.507
- Stop!

07:46.591 --> 07:48.634
That's Desdemona's powers.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.303
- Oh, phew...

07:50.386 --> 07:51.387
I mean,
everybody knows

07:51.470 --> 07:53.514
Agamemnon tastes better
on potatoes.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.978
- Do you think it's weird that
we named our fundraiser

07:59.061 --> 08:01.772
before we decided
what to raise funds for?

08:01.856 --> 08:05.276
- When inspiration strikes,
you just gotta go with it!

08:05.359 --> 08:07.820
"Panther Paws for a Cause"
is brilliant.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.822
So glad I thought of it.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.407
- I thought Diego did.

08:11.490 --> 08:12.783
- But we're a couple,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.577
so I'm allowed to take
credit for his ideas.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.246
That's how
relationships work.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.247
Katie?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.708
Pass me the
Panther Pink paint.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.962
Thank you.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.547
[screaming]

08:28.257 --> 08:30.760
- So fun!
That is never gonna get old.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.094
- Jax!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.638
Look what you
made me do!

08:33.721 --> 08:34.179
- Sorry.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.265
White furniture?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.475
You're basically
asking for it.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.227
- Clean it up!

08:42.647 --> 08:44.941
- You know, you probably
shouldn't paint in here.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.027
- Oh, and where else should
I paint in my house?

08:48.110 --> 08:49.946
- I don't know,
maybe the painting studio?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.073
- [gasps]

08:52.156 --> 08:53.783
That is Maddie's
lip makeup bathroom!

08:53.866 --> 08:54.492
- Come on!

08:54.575 --> 08:56.577
- Where are we going?

08:56.661 --> 08:57.995
- The painting studio.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.163
I have to fix
my lip gloss

08:59.247 --> 08:59.664
after all the shrieking
and gasping.

09:05.753 --> 09:09.131
- The bunny runs around
the tree, but, uh-oh!

09:09.215 --> 09:10.549
He sees a dog and jumps
into the hole.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.097
- This is impossible!

09:16.180 --> 09:20.142
- Are you saying that humans
can do something you can't?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.103
- I will conquer you.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.983
- Learning to tie
our shoes, are we?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.150
Ah, to be four years
old again.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.695
- What do you want?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.613
- To broker a truce
between you and Emma.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.823
- Out of the question.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.074
- Wait.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.325
Let's at least
hear her out.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.078
- You say you want to take
Emma's powers away

09:39.161 --> 09:41.455
because she's
getting out of control.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.915
But she's not.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.458
- Oh, really?

09:44.542 --> 09:47.253
- She's just experimenting,
pushing the limits a little.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.921
But she's not going
to do anything crazy.

09:49.005 --> 09:49.922
- Oh, really?

09:50.006 --> 09:51.424
- What are you proposing?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.009
- That you have a real
conversation with her.

09:53.092 --> 09:57.013
Really listen to her and she'll
really listen to you.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.055
As long as you're not
interrupting

09:58.139 --> 09:59.181
every two seconds with--

09:59.265 --> 10:00.641
[together]
Oh, really?

10:00.725 --> 10:04.020
- Look, if you make an
enemy out of Emma now,

10:04.103 --> 10:06.355
you'll never
get her back.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.065
- I think it's
a reasonable idea.

10:08.149 --> 10:11.027
- We cannot even consider
anything like that

10:11.110 --> 10:14.030
until we have our
powers returned to us.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.490
Take that message to
the Chosen One.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.034
- She'll never
go for it.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.327
She'll think
it's a trick.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.620
- Well, then we have
nothing else to discuss.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.913
- Guys, come on.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.458
Let's at least
give it a shot.

10:25.541 --> 10:26.876
- Yeah, I mean honestly,

10:26.959 --> 10:30.254
not really speaking from a
position of strength here.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.547
- The Chosen One may think
she holds the cards,

10:31.630 --> 10:33.674
but she's only
won this round.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.011
- We have deposed
a Chosen One before.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.681
We can do it again.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.515
- Okay.

10:55.988 --> 10:56.530
- What are you
doing here?

10:56.614 --> 10:57.990
- Looking for you.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.661
- What's up?

11:02.745 --> 11:04.955
- I was thinking about what
you said the other day,

11:05.039 --> 11:07.416
this other life.

11:07.500 --> 11:12.004
I just started to wonder if it
might actually be possible.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.172
- I know it is.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.299
Diego and Maddie saw it,
they can tell you.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.842
- Why don't you tell me
about it to start?

11:20.679 --> 11:21.931
<i>LIANA: I knew you were home</i>
<i>when I heard Maddie scream.</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:23.265
Jessie!

11:23.349 --> 11:24.892
- Hi, Mom!

11:24.975 --> 11:26.227
- I was so worried
about you!

11:26.310 --> 11:28.604
Thank goodness
you're all right.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.398
Let me take a look
at both of you.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.901
My beautiful,
perfect family.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.196
- [laughing]

11:37.279 --> 11:38.948
I can believe you
lived in the Everglades,

11:39.031 --> 11:40.866
and you had a snake
named Billy,

11:40.950 --> 11:44.578
but there's no way I can believe
the T-3 were actually helpful.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.123
Are you sure they weren't
punking the alligators?

11:47.206 --> 11:48.165
- It's true.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.751
And not "lived"
in the Everglades.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.294
I live there.

11:52.378 --> 11:52.837
I just need to find
a way back.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.215
- Okay.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.926
If you say so.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.678
So, I live there too?

12:00.761 --> 12:02.930
- Yeah, and you
were amazing.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.141
You were the best wilderness
guide in the Glades.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.142
- Really?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227
- Mm-hmm.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.812
You didn't just
help the animals,

12:09.895 --> 12:11.480
you took care of
people, too.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.773
If somebody got hurt,
you took care of 'em.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.567
You knew how to splint
broken bones,

12:14.650 --> 12:17.736
suck the poison
out of snakebites.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.904
Anything.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.198
- [scoffs]
That totally sounds like me.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.200
The other day, I got
a blister from my sandal

12:23.284 --> 12:25.828
and I knew exactly where
to put the bandage.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.121
- Well, that's something.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.042
- Is Emma there?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.043
In this other life?

12:33.127 --> 12:35.171
- Nope.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.506
Never even heard of her,
or Iridium High.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.841
I'd barely even
been to Miami.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.218
It's just you and me.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.678
Best friends
and a couple.

12:42.761 --> 12:46.807
- That sounds...
really nice, actually.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.683
- It is.

12:51.937 --> 12:52.480
- Am I late?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.648
- No, I'm early.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.775
Just thought I'd do
a little reading.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.402
- What are you
looking for now?

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
- Nothing in particular.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.406
General knowledge,
interesting observations,

13:02.490 --> 13:03.699
et cetera,
et cetera.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.576
So, where's the family?

13:05.659 --> 13:06.911
- They're on their way.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.163
It feels so weird to hear
that word, "family,"

13:09.246 --> 13:10.706
I mean,
applied to me.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.584
- Weird but great,
right?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.669
Your mom seems cool
and Jessie's... a hoot.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.423
- That's one word
for her.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.884
I'm just so used to
living on my own,

13:21.967 --> 13:24.803
I mean, with my dad, which
is basically living alone,

13:24.887 --> 13:27.681
that it's going to be
strange living with them.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.266
- And don't forget
the Van Pelts.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.893
- How could I forget?

13:30.976 --> 13:33.896
Maddie's always yelling at me
to get out of her bathroom.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.190
I just don't understand
how mom thinks

13:36.273 --> 13:38.108
that the Van Pelts
are gonna protect her.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.528
Maddie's mom doesn't
even have powers,

13:40.611 --> 13:43.113
and my dad is ten times
more powerful than Maddie.

13:43.197 --> 13:43.906
- And it's not like she'd lift a
finger

13:43.989 --> 13:45.699
to protect you if she could.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.743
She wouldn't want
to chip a nail.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.745
- I guess if anyone's gonna
protect 'em, it's me.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.121
- And me.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.623
I got your back.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.916
- Hi, there!

13:53.999 --> 13:56.585
I've been so looking
forward to this dinner.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.336
So, what's good here?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.588
- The pizza.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.090
They'll customize it
however you want.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.467
My dad and I like
to get a little...

14:03.551 --> 14:05.594
crazy with
the toppings.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.012
- What about the salads?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.806
I want to be sure
my kids eat healthy.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.183
- What can I get
for you guys?

14:11.267 --> 14:15.145
- I'll have a pizza with salad
on it, so that I can save time.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.606
- I'll have
the chicken salad.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.483
- Cheese pizza,
please.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.193
- Emma?

14:21.277 --> 14:22.611
Emma!

14:22.695 --> 14:24.321
- Oh, sorry, Gigi.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.614
- No problem.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.408
What can I get for you?
[text alert]

14:27.491 --> 14:28.450
No way!

14:28.534 --> 14:30.035
I've gotta answer
this text--here!

14:30.119 --> 14:31.787
Oh, my gosh.
- Wow, does that happen...

14:31.870 --> 14:33.956
[together]
All the time.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.458
- Well, then,
in that case,

14:36.542 --> 14:37.626
what do you think,
Emma?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.962
Pizza, salad,
or pizza and salad?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.213
- I guess
I'll get both.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.214
- Okay.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.341
- Oh, just up there.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.805
You were a million
miles away there.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.056
What were you
thinking about?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.141
- Oh.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.684
Just stuff.

14:53.767 --> 14:56.228
Your mom is
so great.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.479
- We're splitting the tab.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.861
- So is Everglades
Mia a Kanay?

15:03.944 --> 15:05.487
- You know,
I'm not really sure.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.655
If she--

15:06.739 --> 15:09.408
I mean, you are--
I don't know about it.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.536
Maybe you are and you don't
even know about it yet.

15:12.620 --> 15:12.911
[text alert]

15:16.415 --> 15:17.541
- Wow.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.918
Is that really
what time it is?

15:20.002 --> 15:22.838
I have to get back
to Vero.

15:22.921 --> 15:23.714
- Do you like it
up there?

15:23.797 --> 15:25.174
- The kids at
school are okay

15:25.257 --> 15:28.010
but I don't have like
a best friend or anything.

15:28.093 --> 15:29.511
- And you live with
your cousins, right?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.929
- Yeah.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.057
They're okay too but we're
not like, super tight.

15:33.807 --> 15:37.394
Who does Everglades Mia--

15:37.478 --> 15:39.229
me, live with?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.189
- Your parents.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.482
Your dad was
a veterinarian.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.691
He took care of all
the injured animals.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.568
You know you learned most
of your skills from him.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.402
- My dad?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.613
My parents?

15:47.696 --> 15:48.822
They're still alive?

15:48.906 --> 15:49.907
- Yeah, they're...

15:51.325 --> 15:53.869
Oh.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.872
- The last time I saw my parents
was when I was seven,

15:56.955 --> 15:58.582
before they were
taken out by witches.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.877
In your--

16:01.960 --> 16:03.962
Our--

16:04.046 --> 16:06.715
Your life, you get to
see him all the time?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.883
- I'm really sorry.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.843
I didn't mean
to upset you.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.387
- It's...

16:11.470 --> 16:13.430
This is...

16:13.514 --> 16:15.432
I've gotta go.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.069
- Ursula, Maddie?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.737
We're back.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.280
- Maybe they went out.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.407
- They're not home?
Sweet!

16:31.490 --> 16:32.491
Maddie's makeup kit,
here I come!

16:32.574 --> 16:34.660
- Jessie...

16:34.743 --> 16:35.577
- What?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.745
I'm not gonna
touch it.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.080
I just want to look.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.332
I never knew there were so many
different shades of pink!

16:41.500 --> 16:45.254
- Well, I think I'm gonna
go up to bed.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.840
- I'm starting to think you
only like me for my mom.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.551
- That's not true.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.344
There's your hair,
too.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.137
<i>JESSIE: Jax, come quick!</i>

17:00.352 --> 17:01.270
- What?
- I don't know!

17:01.353 --> 17:02.438
I just found them
this way.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.356
- Mom.
Mom!

17:04.440 --> 17:05.607
Stay in your room!
Lock the door.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.483
- Maddie, Mrs. Van Pelt!

17:07.568 --> 17:08.527
Are you all right?

17:08.609 --> 17:10.279
Can you hear me?

17:10.362 --> 17:11.613
- Maybe they ate
that blowfish

17:11.696 --> 17:12.448
that paralyzes you
when it's not cooked.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.366
- Stand back.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.534
- Why?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.743
- Maddie's silence I do approve,

17:16.827 --> 17:18.328
but show me why
she can't talk or move.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.375
- Whoa.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.419
- That means...

17:25.502 --> 17:27.588
- You're correct, son.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.673
Whoa, there's no need
for any of that.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.592
I didn't hurt Ursula

17:31.675 --> 17:34.470
or her very talkative
and opinionated daughter.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.637
[muffled shouting]

17:35.721 --> 17:37.306
- What are you
doing here?

17:37.389 --> 17:38.474
What do you even want?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.516
- I'm here for you.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.851
Both of you.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.311
You belong with me.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.479
- We're not going
with you.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.855
- Your mother is not
who she is--

17:44.938 --> 17:46.398
- Stop it!

17:46.482 --> 17:48.650
I don't want to hear
what you have to say.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.235
I believed in everything

17:50.319 --> 17:52.654
that you've had to say
about mom for too long.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.989
- You're right.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.824
I shouldn't have lied,
but you need to understand--

17:55.908 --> 17:56.825
- Enough!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.705
- Stop!

18:01.789 --> 18:03.165
I think you'd better
go now, Mr. Novoa.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.291
- Not without my kids.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.334
Both of you.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.794
- Not a chance.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.587
Emma, get Jessie
out of here.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.013
[muffled shouting]

18:27.314 --> 18:28.232
Emma, keep going,
we've almost got him!

18:37.783 --> 18:40.118
Jessie, come out.

18:40.202 --> 18:40.285
We're safe now.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.124
[muffled shouting]

18:51.672 --> 18:53.465
- Maddie-Winky.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.386
We are okay and
that is what matters.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.137
- My...

18:59.221 --> 19:01.056
stuff!
- Huh?

19:01.139 --> 19:04.017
- What did you do...

19:04.101 --> 19:06.228
with my stuff?

19:06.311 --> 19:08.814
- Maybe we should go,
like, right now.

19:08.897 --> 19:09.815
- Yeah.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.491
- [gasps]

19:20.993 --> 19:23.078
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

19:23.161 --> 19:24.746
- Sorry.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.081
I thought you
were your dad.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.916
- So, you didn't
find him?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.293
- He's not here.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.129
- Well, he's not at any of
the other houses.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.589
At least not
the ones that I know of.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.757
What does a guy need with
ten houses anyway?

19:35.841 --> 19:37.801
- We must have driven
him into hiding.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.261
Should we bring them in?

19:39.344 --> 19:39.386
- Yeah.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.392
<i>LIANA:</i>
<i>Is it safe?</i>

19:49.062 --> 19:50.272
- It is for now.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.524
I'm surprised,
though.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.984
Why would you want
to live here?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.944
- Well, I lived here
when you guys were little.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.905
I always liked this house.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.740
And besides, we don't have
anywhere else to go.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.076
- W-What if he comes back?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.703
I can't be here
all the time.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.580
- I can make it safe.
- That's right.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.457
You can cast a protection bubble
around the house

20:08.540 --> 20:09.750
to keep him out.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.543
Oh, Emma, that would make me
feel so much better.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.295
- You sure you have
anything left?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.796
I mean, you did use
a lot of magic tonight.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.633
- I've got plenty.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.759
To keep away any
Jake Novoa trouble,

20:18.842 --> 20:21.011
wrap this house in
a protective bubble.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.059
- Thank you so much,
Emma.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.977
Now we can relax.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.604
- I hope it doesn't keep out
our food deliveries.

20:30.687 --> 20:31.355
Who's up for pizza?

20:36.693 --> 20:38.153
- You were
amazing tonight.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.322
I really appreciate
everything you did.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.990
- You were amazing.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.575
You really
took charge.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.451
- I couldn't have
done it without you.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.078
You are one
powerful witch.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.122
- I have been
practicing.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.208
The Chosen One has to know
her own powers, right?

20:51.291 --> 20:55.504
- Well...
it looks good on you.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.672
- Thanks.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.965
Feels pretty good, too.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.764
I've made a decision.

21:47.848 --> 21:48.890
- Oh, me too.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.100
I am done eating
corndogs.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.810
You know, I always think
I'm gonna like them,

21:51.893 --> 21:52.936
but then I get the
breading stuck in my teeth--

21:53.020 --> 21:54.104
- I think...

21:54.187 --> 21:57.983
No, I know I can
bring my mom back.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.360
I don't care what
it takes.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.820
I'm going to do it.
