WEBVTT

00:07.560 --> 00:12.160
A FEW HOURS LATER

00:13.240 --> 00:15.880
THE CARABINIERI RELEASE A VIDEO

00:15.960 --> 00:19.720
OF PINO MANIACI ALLEGEDLY
EXTORTING MONEY FROM THE LOCAL MAYOR

00:21.400 --> 00:24.160
In Palermo,
an incredible story is unfolding.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.920
From anti-Mafia champion to extortionist,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.440
the double life of Pino Maniaci,
director of Telejato.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.760
I told you this was coming.
I warned you,

00:37.840 --> 00:41.600
and you kept on making mistakes.
You want to keep on making mistakes.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.360
This is the other face of Pino Maniaci.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.040
He is not a hero
fighting for the rule of law at all,

00:50.120 --> 00:53.280
as revealed in secret recordings
by the Carabinieri as part of an inquiry

00:53.360 --> 00:55.000
into the Mafia in Borgetto.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.240
So €366 plus 100
you still owe me, 466.

01:00.320 --> 01:03.200
I need €466
because I need to go to the bank.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.240
Journalist Pino Maniaci,

01:06.320 --> 01:08.720
who is proclaimed the champion
of free and brave news,

01:08.800 --> 01:12.080
has been accused of extorting
money to tone down his news reports.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.120
Pino Maniaci
exposed criminals on Telejato,

01:17.200 --> 01:19.320
and in Partinico, he fought the Mafia.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.360
But for the prosecutor in Palermo,
he himself committed the same crimes

01:23.880 --> 01:26.000
using the same methods as the Mafia.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.560
Here's €100,
so you can get rid of some of that shit.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.200
Two, three, four,
and five, and that's 200, 270, okay?

01:35.560 --> 01:38.280
They released a fucking DVD

01:40.080 --> 01:44.880
with the aim of ruining
Pino Maniaci's reputation.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.240
As long as he fought the Mafia,
everyone was fine.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.320
When he decided to attack the big guns,

01:55.400 --> 01:58.200
Pino had to be stopped.
He had to be destroyed.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.920
They put me with ten mafiosos
who we think are pieces of shit.

02:08.040 --> 02:11.520
You have to ask yourselves,
"When will all this mess end?"

02:15.080 --> 02:18.800
Ruining Pino Maniaci. Ruining Telejato,

02:18.880 --> 02:20.240
to achieve what?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.080
To shut us down.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.360
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

02:55.920 --> 02:58.400
MAY 2016

02:59.200 --> 03:02.480
With everything that's come out,
this doesn't look good for you.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.400
I know that.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.120
It's really disgraceful,
and very disappointing.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.200
The media has already sentenced me

03:12.280 --> 03:15.840
without a trial.
Pino Maniaci isn't an extortioner.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.520
Pino Maniaci
has never asked a dime from anyone,

03:19.600 --> 03:23.960
except what is owed to him.
Pino Maniaci has had a lot of trouble.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.480
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:36.160 --> 03:40.240
48 HOURS AFTER PINO MANIACI WAS CHARGED

03:46.560 --> 03:48.920
NEWSROOM

03:50.920 --> 03:54.040
Here's €100,
so you can get rid of some of that shit…

03:54.560 --> 03:58.600
Two, three, four, and five,
and that's 200, 270, okay?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.800
So this is the video
that incriminated me

04:02.880 --> 04:05.720
and that was broadcast all over the world

04:07.720 --> 04:10.880
to show that Pino Maniaci is an extorter.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.360
I challenge anybody,

04:17.480 --> 04:21.000
prosecutors, only an ignoramus,

04:21.080 --> 04:24.320
the last of the idiots,
who fails to understand

04:24.840 --> 04:28.720
that €366 is an invoice with VAT

04:28.800 --> 04:30.960
and not some kind of extortion.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.800
Here it is. Now…

04:45.680 --> 04:46.560
Hello?

04:47.200 --> 04:48.040
Yes.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.400
Yes, what is it?

04:53.040 --> 04:53.960
I get it.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.120
I understand.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.360
Give me half an hour?

05:00.280 --> 05:02.080
Okay. Okay. Goodbye.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.640
The Carabinieri have got the order.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.400
They're going to serve it to me.
They're leaving now.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.320
Okay.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.160
Fuck. Is this for real, guys?

05:26.520 --> 05:30.000
They're banishing you? To Sciacca, Pino?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.760
Sciacca? Why? I decide where I go.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.640
When it happened,

05:39.720 --> 05:42.200
when my dad had to leave,

05:43.280 --> 05:44.960
my world fell around me.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.960
He had to leave Telejato.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.480
He had to leave his family.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.720
So that time was awful.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.800
It's not just the Mafia who are the enemy,

06:05.480 --> 06:07.120
but also the higher powers.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.360
Pino Maniaci
is leaving Partinico.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.960
From anti-Mafia hero to extortion suspect.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.720
Today, the judges
banished him from Partinico.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.440
He's no longer permitted to live
in the provinces of Trapani and Palermo.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.360
They're closing in on me.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.640
Those who oppose the big guns,
get screwed in the ass.

07:36.160 --> 07:41.120
They spread shit to destroy Pino Maniaci
and make him look like a fraud.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.680
I have made some mistakes, of course.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.600
I've made mistakes,
but I haven't committed extortion.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.960
Their aim was to break up my family.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.160
It's truly devastating

08:06.240 --> 08:09.400
that the news was spread
at an international level.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.480
We'll start with the report
about me being banished.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.080
You'll have everything by 1:00 p.m.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.440
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.520
If anyone thought Telejato was closing,

08:38.480 --> 08:39.720
you thought wrong.

08:39.800 --> 08:41.920
Freedom of information continues…

08:44.160 --> 08:46.600
…despite what I'm going through.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.200
Pino Maniaci is being persecuted.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.160
They want to stop this rabid dog
who is being accused

08:58.240 --> 08:59.720
of extorting everyone.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.000
Here is the report,

09:05.080 --> 09:08.000
and we'll start by telling you
about the current situation.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.440
-Okay.
-You can send that now.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.040
If you wanna stop me
from using TV to extort people,

09:30.120 --> 09:32.200
you'll have to take my cameras away.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.440
You've banned me from broadcasting.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.120
That was just a measure

09:43.200 --> 09:44.760
to change the public's opinion

09:44.840 --> 09:46.720
of Telejato and Pino Maniaci.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
First, there was the video
from the Carabinieri,

09:54.080 --> 09:57.600
then there was the precautionary measure
that said that Pino Maniaci

09:57.680 --> 09:58.840
had to be sent away.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.840
This… um… This concoction,
this diabolical arrangement…

10:07.360 --> 10:08.800
What was the aim of it?

10:08.880 --> 10:12.240
It was intended to show
that Pino Maniaci can't be trusted,

10:12.320 --> 10:14.920
that he's a scoundrel, that he's a cheat.

10:30.480 --> 10:35.360
20 DAYS LATER

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
MAY 2016

10:40.920 --> 10:44.400
Pino Maniaci
returned to anchor Telejato News.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.880
The journalist was accused of extortion
by the public prosecutors of Palermo.

10:49.960 --> 10:54.120
Now his Provision of Residence
is revoked due to an administrative error.

11:10.280 --> 11:14.240
After 20 days, he returned home
and returned to broadcasting Telejato.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.480
However, the road remains long

11:19.000 --> 11:20.760
because he's still facing trial,

11:21.280 --> 11:25.000
we have to defend ourselves against
the existing accusation of extortion.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.000
What is it? What is it?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.960
What is it?

11:35.440 --> 11:38.360
MISTER VANITY
HAIR FOR MEN AND WOMEN

11:41.960 --> 11:43.400
I went to Sciacca.

11:44.200 --> 11:49.000
A judge can say a politician is corrupt,
but you can't say that a judge is corrupt

11:49.080 --> 11:52.040
because as soon as you say
that a judge is stealing money,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.360
that they're corrupt, they destroy you.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.440
I think…
that any normal person in this situation,

12:05.920 --> 12:09.080
would have… reacted differently.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.320
My reaction was quite strong.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.520
I defended myself, tooth and nail,

12:20.040 --> 12:21.160
at all costs,

12:35.840 --> 12:38.400
Did you bring oranges?
What did you bring me?

12:40.720 --> 12:41.720
How are you?

12:44.800 --> 12:47.000
Telejato is Telejato today

12:47.080 --> 12:49.160
thanks to Salvo Vitale,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.320
our pillar of strength.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.000
Last night, he went crazy.
He went so crazy last night.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.000
He's been with me
through good times and bad,

12:58.680 --> 13:00.120
since the start.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.240
Peaches!

13:03.400 --> 13:04.600
You know I like them.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.320
The basket doesn't mean I bought them.
They're from my garden.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.880
Wonderful.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.440
I've been working here
for almost 20 years.

13:18.600 --> 13:23.200
I've always investigated the Mafia,
the environment, and the local news.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.200
Pino is like a kamikaze,
who isn't afraid of anybody.

13:33.080 --> 13:37.080
I don't think he'd fight
if he didn't think that… something

13:37.160 --> 13:41.000
would slowly… but surely come from it.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.640
So, I have two aims.

13:45.640 --> 13:49.120
One… to save the TV station

13:49.200 --> 13:52.120
because like I said,
they closed my bank account.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.880
Everything went up in smoke.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.320
Maybe they'll cut my phone line too.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.200
We're completely screwed, if we shut down,

13:59.280 --> 14:00.800
the world shuts down.

14:01.960 --> 14:03.800
Two, get people's support back.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.640
Rolling.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.080
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.680
Whoever thought Telejato was closing down…

14:15.040 --> 14:18.120
Some people thought
they had destroyed this TV station,

14:18.880 --> 14:20.720
as you can see, they were wrong.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.280
They were wrong because

14:24.280 --> 14:27.480
even with everything
that has happened in the media

14:28.000 --> 14:29.320
in recent days…

14:32.240 --> 14:34.160
…Telejato has fought back.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.600
From this point of view,
Pino is extremely stubborn and determined.

14:41.440 --> 14:46.320
So he starts his investigation again
into the Preventive Measures Department

14:47.680 --> 14:49.800
and continues to accuse its president,

14:49.880 --> 14:51.560
Judge Silvana Saguto.

14:54.560 --> 14:59.080
How will the Saguto case end?
The newspapers don't talk about it.

14:59.600 --> 15:00.880
They don't talk about it.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.800
It's one of the biggest scandals
of this century,

15:04.880 --> 15:07.360
managing the seized Mafia assets

15:07.440 --> 15:09.000
for personal use.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.120
The first reports that we did

15:15.200 --> 15:18.200
about preventive measures, on this theft

15:18.280 --> 15:22.840
of confiscated goods, were back in 2013.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.880
Now, dear Judge Saguto,

15:25.960 --> 15:27.920
MARCH 2013

15:28.000 --> 15:30.040
you are obsessed with power,

15:32.080 --> 15:35.160
and you say
you managed the seized Mafia assets

15:35.240 --> 15:36.520
for the collective good

15:36.600 --> 15:38.320
not to line your friends' pockets?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.240
You know what they say,

15:41.320 --> 15:44.680
as the mouse said to the nut,
"Give me time and I'll crack you."

15:45.760 --> 15:49.520
We'll see whether there will be
an arrest warrant, or a search.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.400
-How are you?
-Good. Thanks.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.800
Is this my car? No.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.960
SILVANA SAGUTO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION

16:19.040 --> 16:21.840
HER JUDGE TITLE IS AT RISK

16:23.520 --> 16:25.520
Palermo is full of plaques.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.200
Strangely, in Palermo, for a long time
people have referred to places saying,

16:29.280 --> 16:31.120
"Where Judge Terranova was killed."

16:31.200 --> 16:34.720
"Where Judge Chinnici was killed."
"Where Borsellino was killed."

16:34.800 --> 16:36.760
"Do you know where Falcone was killed?"

16:38.160 --> 16:41.760
It's very sad, and I think it only…
it only happens in Palermo.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.080
Look, the Mafia is quieter again

16:51.160 --> 16:54.520
and so, I think, more dangerous
because no one's fighting them.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.480
WE SHOUT, WE CHEER
BALLARÒ IS MAGIC!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.320
See that building?

17:01.840 --> 17:05.160
I seized it,
I confiscated it and fixed it.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.080
It was one of
the first things I confiscated.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.680
When I arrived
at the Preventive Measures Department,

17:16.760 --> 17:18.320
as the president,

17:18.400 --> 17:22.600
I increased the number
of preventive measures by 400%.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.320
Here, for example, I confiscated
the fruit and vegetable market.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.680
Nothing was legal
about that fruit and vegetable market,

17:31.760 --> 17:37.200
and they complained because we ruined
their flourishing, and illegal, business.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.840
People were scared of what I was doing

17:45.720 --> 17:48.400
because no one had ever gotten
the same results.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.480
The investigations
stem from complaints

17:52.560 --> 17:55.040
about the appointment
of a group of administrators

17:55.120 --> 17:57.040
that made huge financial gains.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.400
"I'm completely above suspicion,"
says Judge Saguto.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.160
"And I request to be heard immediately,
so I can clear my reputation."

18:10.720 --> 18:12.880
It's crazy. Crazy.

18:12.960 --> 18:17.280
TO THE VICTIMS
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE MAFIA

18:19.720 --> 18:21.760
The anti-Mafia Mafia.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.920
This is really serious.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.400
And it's… devastating.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.640
The judicial administrators,
after they got their money,

18:35.360 --> 18:37.640
left businesses to go bankrupt.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.400
Isn't that great?

18:41.080 --> 18:42.880
The anti-Mafia Mafia.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.080
No one else
wanted to confront Judge Saguto.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.280
Why?

18:49.440 --> 18:51.920
Because she has
such strong influence and power,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.680
that she just has to say the word,
and she can bring down half of Italy.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.520
I'm just waiting.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.040
There's nothing else to do.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.080
I'm not scared.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.840
I read what Telejato published recently,
but, obviously,

19:11.920 --> 19:13.800
I'm not going to reply to Telejato.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.560
No, not yet, Giovanni.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.760
-Come in.
-Pino's not having pasta.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.880
Really?

19:43.480 --> 19:45.840
Am I wrong, or did you just want dessert?

19:45.920 --> 19:47.120
No, no.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.680
Even if there was
some extortion,

19:54.760 --> 19:57.240
why did they have to lump him in
with the Mafia?

19:57.880 --> 20:00.520
Arresting him with his worst enemies,

20:01.240 --> 20:04.000
so that anyone looking
at those photos would think…

20:05.960 --> 20:10.000
I think the idea is that Pino Maniaci
was the same as them, right?

20:10.960 --> 20:11.800
Stay there.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.680
Because I think
that their goal was to…

20:18.520 --> 20:20.920
If these people hate him,

20:21.760 --> 20:24.840
their aim was to make them hate him
even more, right?

20:27.200 --> 20:31.880
PINO MANIACI IS ON TRIAL
WITH ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE BORGETTO MAFIA

20:35.760 --> 20:38.080
THE CARABINIERI OPERATION

20:38.160 --> 20:41.320
AGAINST THE BORGETTO MAFIA
IS CALLED KELEVRA

20:48.000 --> 20:50.400
The terrible thing
about operation Kelevra

20:50.480 --> 20:53.640
was being imprisoned
at the Partinico Carabinieri Station,

20:53.720 --> 20:54.760
as it happened,

20:55.560 --> 20:58.800
with all the mafiosos
I had always badmouthed.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.000
Seeing all that riffraff next to me,

21:06.800 --> 21:07.720
was scary.

21:08.960 --> 21:09.920
JUNE 2011

21:10.000 --> 21:14.480
Nicolò Salto, who is often named
as the boss of the Borgetto Mafia,

21:15.520 --> 21:17.480
has been placed under house arrest,

21:18.120 --> 21:19.920
and therefore, he's back with us.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.840
Nicolò Salto
had Borgetto in his hands.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.520
And when I saw him in Borgetto,
going into a pharmacy,

21:40.240 --> 21:41.080
he threatened me

21:41.160 --> 21:44.160
by saying that I should buy
three meters of rope

21:45.480 --> 21:48.080
and find a tree to hang myself from.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.480
That's the price you pay

21:51.560 --> 21:53.840
for being a certain kind of journalist.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.680
Kelevra is becoming a shit show

22:01.760 --> 22:05.600
because by putting Pino Maniaci
with the people he was fighting,

22:05.680 --> 22:08.960
it sent a message that,
"You're all the same thing."

22:11.720 --> 22:14.440
That's what the prosecutors
of Palermo wanted to do.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.040
It worked. It worked pretty well.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.720
And then obviously, all together,
they decided to make me pay.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.000
They are the ones with all the power.

22:46.760 --> 22:49.560
PALERMO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
FALCONE AND BORSELLINO

22:52.440 --> 22:55.360
I started my career
as a public prosecutor in Palermo

22:55.440 --> 22:56.960
working on Mafia cases,

22:59.560 --> 23:02.560
the relationship
between the State and the Mafia.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.880
This is what made me popular.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.800
PINO MANIACI'S LAWYER

23:07.880 --> 23:08.840
Now, I'm a lawyer.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.680
I defend citizens
who are victims of injustice,

23:12.200 --> 23:15.600
and this is why
I came to Sicily, to defend Pino Maniaci.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.920
Coming from the airport,
you pass the site of the Capaci Bombing,

23:21.440 --> 23:23.120
where Giovanni Falcone died.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.280
He was
one of the most famous judges in Palermo.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.320
I was very lucky,

23:34.840 --> 23:38.120
lucky to start my career
in the right place, at the right time,

23:38.200 --> 23:39.040
let's say.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.280
I worked with the best in the field,
Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.

23:46.280 --> 23:49.320
I started my career
as a public prosecutor with Borsellino.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.400
We liked each other straight away,
and we became friends.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.320
On May 23rd, 1992,
I drove along the same motorway

24:03.400 --> 24:06.720
Giovanni Falcone died on two hours later.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.080
AMBULANCE

24:09.200 --> 24:12.200
MAY 23, 1992

24:22.480 --> 24:26.240
A few months later,
Paolo Borsellino was killed.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.840
He was blown up
outside his mother's house.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.600
And when Borsellino died,
it was like the end of everything.

24:38.760 --> 24:39.680
I was distraught

24:39.760 --> 24:42.480
because not only was my boss dead,

24:42.560 --> 24:46.720
not only was my teacher dead,
but… my friend was dead.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.240
And from then on, I dedicated myself

24:51.320 --> 24:56.720
to investigations to find out the truth
behind those terrible events.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.040
Pino Maniaci made his name on TV,

25:03.120 --> 25:05.400
and he was destroyed on TV.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.480
That video was the murder weapon.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.120
Tomorrow is an important day
in Pino Maniaci's trial.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.160
We have to convince
the judges that his case

25:30.240 --> 25:33.040
should be severed
from the other defendants'.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.160
Because those defendants
have always been the enemy.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.320
He accused them of being mafiosos.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.120
They can't and mustn't be tried together.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.840
Oh, shit.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.360
The light?

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
Where's the light?

25:56.760 --> 25:59.920
Look, the light! They still haven't cut
the electricity off.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.840
Pino Maniaci
has been accused of serious crimes.

26:05.800 --> 26:09.000
Extortion, attempted extortion,
and defamation.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.560
He risks ten years
in prison for extortion alone.

26:16.440 --> 26:19.840
So let's discuss
the process of separating this trial.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.520
The prosecutor will object.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.280
There's a 90% chance
that the judge will reject it,

26:25.360 --> 26:27.480
but we have to put it on record.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.920
We'll see what they do,
whether they retire to their chambers

26:31.000 --> 26:34.280
or if they stay there
and decide straight away.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.560
NEWSROOM

26:37.000 --> 26:41.120
OCTOBER 2017

26:41.840 --> 26:47.800
KELEVRA TRIAL
SEPARATION OF THE HEARING

27:10.160 --> 27:13.040
The request under review
is founded on the premise

27:13.120 --> 27:16.080
that the crimes
that Maniaci is accused of,

27:16.160 --> 27:19.960
have nothing to do with the crimes
the other defendants are accused of.

27:23.040 --> 27:26.280
And we find that Giuseppe Maniaci

27:26.360 --> 27:28.320
should be removed from this trial.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.720
-Congratulations.
-So, the first success.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.720
-Tell your lawyers "congratulations."
-Congratulations.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.160
His trial continues.

27:40.480 --> 27:45.320
There are serious charges, extortion,
attempted extortion, defamation.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.400
We hope to win on all fronts.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.280
The motion
from Maniaci's defense team was granted.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.480
He won't be tried
alongside other Mafia defendants

28:01.560 --> 28:04.320
because he has nothing to do
with their charges.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.440
Welcome to today's Telejato News.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.680
I will be tried alone.

28:16.400 --> 28:20.760
If we were playing soccer,
we'd say, "Two-nil to the defense."

28:23.000 --> 28:25.200
The judge decided to remove me

28:25.280 --> 28:28.320
from a case that I had nothing to do with.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.920
You can imagine

28:33.440 --> 28:37.120
the wonderful glances directed my way

28:37.760 --> 28:38.920
from behind the glass.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.840
Let's roll forward.
We will continue in this fight,

28:45.360 --> 28:47.040
fighting criminals

28:47.560 --> 28:54.280
and mafiosos… with no ifs or buts,
regardless of what happens to me, always.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.840
AFTER ABOUT TWO YEARS

29:07.920 --> 29:10.600
THE INVESTIGATION
INTO SILVANA SAGUTO COMES TO AN END

29:14.080 --> 29:15.880
Everything is clear.

29:15.960 --> 29:19.160
The prosecution of Caltanissetta
has indicted Silvana Saguto,

29:19.840 --> 29:21.920
following a five-hour-long debate.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.320
She's been accused of creating a system
to manage assets seized from the Mafia.

29:28.080 --> 29:31.160
From corruption
to embezzlement, the charges are serious.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.160
She's accused of managing
the controversial department

29:34.240 --> 29:37.080
for the custody of seized
and confiscated Mafia assets

29:37.160 --> 29:38.480
like a family business.

29:40.200 --> 29:43.280
When I found out
that the accusations were corruption,

29:43.360 --> 29:45.400
embezzlement, and abuse of power,

29:45.480 --> 29:48.640
I thought that my colleagues were crazy,
and I was furious.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.480
When it emerged that Judge Saguto
was being investigated

29:53.560 --> 29:55.680
for a series of serious crimes,

29:56.280 --> 29:57.640
it was definitely big news.

30:01.640 --> 30:05.480
No one expected that the president
would be involved in such serious crimes.

30:05.560 --> 30:09.480
"It's a huge blow to a credible
institution," write the magistrates.

30:09.560 --> 30:13.120
It's made even worse by the fact
that it happened in the same department

30:13.200 --> 30:16.800
that represents legality and commitment
to fighting criminal activity.

30:18.240 --> 30:22.920
Then we found out that not only
was Saguto implicated as the president,

30:23.000 --> 30:24.040
but also her family.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.720
CRIMINAL CHARGES
CORRUPTION - EMBEZZLEMENT

30:27.800 --> 30:31.000

30:32.160 --> 30:34.760
CRIMINAL CHARGES
PLAGIARISM OF DISSERTATION

30:36.000 --> 30:38.160
CRIMINAL CHARGES
MONEY LAUNDERING

30:40.440 --> 30:43.880
How could my colleagues think
that I was corrupt?

30:43.960 --> 30:45.760
39 CHARGES  INCLUDING

30:45.840 --> 30:47.520
FORGERY
ABUSE OF POWER

30:47.600 --> 30:49.080
CORRUPTION
EMBEZZLEMENT

30:49.160 --> 30:52.560
VIOLATING PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENTIALITY
CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY

30:55.600 --> 30:58.440
They were all charged with
corruption, Silvana Saguto,

30:58.520 --> 31:00.360
her husband, Lorenzo Caramma,

31:00.440 --> 31:02.600
and the most well-known
court administrator,

31:02.680 --> 31:05.280
Palermo lawyer
Gaetano Cappellano Seminara.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.880
Saguto was accused of favoring
Cappellano Seminara's appointment

31:08.960 --> 31:10.200
in exchange for payoffs.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.360
It has emerged that Cappellano Seminara

31:13.440 --> 31:15.680
suggested an asset for seizure.

31:15.760 --> 31:20.520
Silvana Seguro seized it,
and named Cappellano as the administrator.

31:21.040 --> 31:23.200
He would then cash in a huge payment,

31:23.280 --> 31:26.560
often based on
an excessive evaluation of the asset,

31:27.160 --> 31:29.200
then he named Silvana Saguto's husband

31:29.280 --> 31:31.080
as his collaborator,

31:31.160 --> 31:33.560
and so a portion of what he had cashed in

31:33.640 --> 31:37.800
went back to Saguto's family
as Saguto's husband's salary.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.320
She's accused of cronyism
with regard to assets

31:41.400 --> 31:42.560
seized from the Mafia,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.720
through a magic circle
of court administrators.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.640
A magic circle.

31:50.680 --> 31:54.920
A banquet for a few people.
I don't know how to explain it.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.720
Pino Maniaci was right.

31:58.800 --> 32:03.320
The anti-Mafia had over-reached
and had become a sort of hidden power,

32:03.400 --> 32:06.760
a way of profiting,
making money, and doing business.
