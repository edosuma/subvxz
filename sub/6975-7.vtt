Excellent job, gentlemen.

tells me our suspect's

31:57.762 --> 31:59.491

31:59.564 --> 32:01.429
Now you're saying it's not over?

32:01.499 --> 32:03.262
We have no murder weapon...

32:03.335 --> 32:05.895
no forensic evidence.

32:05.971 --> 32:08.201
Unless we accept
Tipet's own beliefs

32:08.273 --> 32:10.707
which you yourself characterize
as preposterous--

32:10.742 --> 32:11.868
It's over, Agent Doggett.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.275
We have no way of explaining

32:13.345 --> 32:14.778
how he killed
any of these people.

32:14.846 --> 32:17.508
I said it's over, Agent Doggett.

32:17.582 --> 32:19.447
I don't need every ""I'' dotted

to know that we've got our man.

Agent Scully, I think

32:37.535 --> 32:39.503
we caught the guy who did it.

32:40.939 --> 32:43.567
But it--

32:43.642 --> 32:45.269
still it--

32:47.012 --> 32:48.809
it just doesn't add up.

what if this guy was right,
you know?

33:06.865 --> 33:09.265
What if I should have
let him die?

33:12.971 --> 33:15.701
I'm not making
a whole lot of sense.

33:15.740 --> 33:17.731
Maybe I just need some sleep.

36:44.749 --> 36:47.877
Last night

36:47.952 --> 36:51.183
I dreamt Tipet
was inside my house

36:51.222 --> 36:53.713
holding an ax.

36:53.758 --> 36:55.851
I thought

36:55.894 --> 36:58.863
I woke up this morning.

You're already awake.

experienced the same thing...

all Tipet's victims.

Everything seemed real

but it was a dream...

37:24.789 --> 37:27.815
...a dream that ended
in their deaths.

37:27.892 --> 37:31.623
