Dad, this isn't about glue.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.400
It's in the second drawer

10:43.660 --> 10:44.630
Things like that

10:44.690 --> 10:45.930
always happen
in this family.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.600
I've noticed that too.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.000
Well, when you feel
like coming down

10:50.060 --> 10:51.530
we'll be there.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.440
( <i>playing saxophone )</i>

10:57.500 --> 11:00.430
Bart, you can come down
to dinner as soon

11:00.510 --> 11:03.310
as you're ready to apologize
to your sister--

11:03.380 --> 11:05.880
and it's going to be
a real apology in front
of everybody

11:05.940 --> 11:07.640
<i>and you have to mean it.</i>

11:07.710 --> 11:09.310
Apologize? For what?

11:09.380 --> 11:10.650
Clearing the table?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.350
Having a sense of humor?

11:12.420 --> 11:15.820
If they think they can starve
an apology out of me-- ha!

11:20.690 --> 11:21.930
Uh-oh.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.250
I mean... good!

11:26.600 --> 11:28.900
<i>No! Drop that drumstick.</i>

11:28.970 --> 11:30.170
<i>Bad dog.</i>

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
<i>Bad Santa's Little Helper.</i>

11:31.300 --> 11:33.900
<i>Come on, give me that.
D-ohh!</i>

11:33.970 --> 11:35.610
<i>Okay, out you go.</i>

11:35.670 --> 11:37.230
( <i>whimpering )</i>

11:37.310 --> 11:38.780
Hey, boy, come here.

11:38.840 --> 11:39.740
You're a good dog.

11:39.810 --> 11:40.710
Come on.

11:40.780 --> 11:41.780
We don't need them

11:41.850 --> 11:42.950

dinner.

Wow!

11:53.160 --> 11:56.100
Swanky.

11:59.660 --> 12:00.990
Mmm, delicious.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.770
Smithers, every year
you outstrip yourself

12:03.840 --> 12:05.270
in succulence.

12:05.340 --> 12:06.840
Thank you, sir.

12:06.910 --> 12:09.180
Would you like
some candied yams?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.880
Oh, no, I couldn't eat
another bite.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.600
Dispose of all this.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.620
I did however, save room
for your special pumpkin pie.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.590
It's cooling
on the windowsill, sir.

12:18.650 --> 12:19.750

14:03.990 --> 14:07.030
At the risk
of losing my voice

14:07.090 --> 14:10.200
let me just say
one more thing.

14:10.260 --> 14:12.600
I'm sorry I came.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.060
When is that boy
going to apologize?

14:14.130 --> 14:15.340
He sure is stubborn.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.370
Homer was never stubborn.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.840
He always folded instantly
over anything.

14:20.910 --> 14:23.380
It was if he had no will
of his own.

14:23.440 --> 14:24.750
Isn't that true, Homer?

14:24.810 --> 14:25.880
Yes, Dad.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.420
12 bucks and a free cookie.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.090
What a country.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.220
Cute little guy.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.200
He's starting
to come around.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.590
You look a
little pale, son.

14:47.670 --> 14:49.670
We better get you
some food.

14:50.940 --> 14:51.540
Here we are.

( <i>cheerful music playing )</i>

15:03.480 --> 15:04.850
Viva, skid row!

15:04.920 --> 15:07.150
It's that anchor dude
from Channel Six.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.590
He's doing
one of those

15:08.650 --> 15:11.020
"Be thankful
for what you got" stories.

15:11.090 --> 15:14.160
Anchor:
Oh, we have lots of names
for these people--

15:14.230 --> 15:18.800
bums, deadbeats, losers,
scums of the Earth.

15:18.860 --> 15:21.030
We'd like to sweep these
people into the gutter

15:21.100 --> 15:22.270
or, if they're already
in the gutter

15:22.330 --> 15:24.430
to some other
out-of-the-way place.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.030
Oh, we have our reasons.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.260
They're depressing.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.010
They wear ragged clothes.

15:29.070 --> 15:31.200
They're "crazy."

15:31.280 --> 15:32.610
- They smell bad.
- Hey, listen, man...

15:32.680 --> 15:33.450
Wait.

15:33.510 --> 15:35.320
I'm going somewhere with this.

15:35.380 --> 15:38.920
So, every year on one lone,

15:38.980 --> 15:42.310
we toss these people a bone--
a turkey bone--

15:42.390 --> 15:45.560
and that's supposed
to make it all better.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.920
<i>No, you won't find

15:54.530 --> 15:57.430
You know, his girl friend
is the weather lady.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.910
You don't say?

15:58.970 --> 16:02.510
Everyone, Lisa wants to read us
a poem she's written.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.970
Sounds interesting.
Okay.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.770
"Howl of the Unappreciated"

16:07.850 --> 16:10.120

16:10.180 --> 16:12.590
I saw the best meal...

It's Bart!

is this?

<i>Son, your family may
be watching. Is there anything</i>

16:21.160 --> 16:22.300
<i>you'd like to say to them?</i>

16:22.360 --> 16:23.700
Yes, there is, Kent.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.730
Ha, ha, I didn't apologize.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.730
Oh, no.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.600
My sweet, little Bart.

16:30.900 --> 16:31.870
Hello, operator?

16:31.940 --> 16:33.640
Give me the number for 911.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.740
Hey, thanks for
your help, fellas.

16:37.810 --> 16:40.480
This reporter smells
another local Emmy.

16:40.550 --> 16:42.780
Yeah, we're rooting
for you, guy.

16:42.850 --> 16:44.950
You got someplace

16:45.020 --> 16:46.350
to sleep tonight, Bart?

16:46.420 --> 16:49.490
Yeah, there's this family
I kinda hang out with.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.880
Sounds pretty sweet.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.190
Yeah, I guess it is.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.860
See you at Christmas.

17:01.030 --> 17:03.470
Listen, guys, I was thinking...

17:03.530 --> 17:06.329
unless you feel weird about
taking money from a kid

17:06.400 --> 17:07.730
I thought maybe...

17:07.810 --> 17:09.910
I wouldn't feel weird,
would you?

17:09.970 --> 17:11.670
No, I'm comfortable
with it.

17:14.849 --> 17:16.550
Will you forget the report?

17:16.609 --> 17:18.880
He's down at the rescue mission.

17:18.950 --> 17:19.890
We checked.
He's long gone.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.220
Can you think
of any reason

17:21.290 --> 17:23.319
he might have run away?
Anything at all?

17:23.390 --> 17:25.660
Well, we did
kind of yell at him

17:25.720 --> 17:27.650
and sent him to his room

17:27.730 --> 17:31.500
and tried to force him
to apologize to his sister.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.620
Uh-huh.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.740
And I said
he ruined Thanksgiving.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.470
Oh, I see.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.040
Best Thanksgiving ever

17:43.110 --> 17:44.180
eh, boy?

17:44.240 --> 17:45.610
Good-bye.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.710
Sorry.
I'm sure Bart
will be back.

17:47.780 --> 17:50.050
I would say something
comforting

17:50.110 --> 17:51.780
but, you know, my voice.

17:51.850 --> 17:52.990
Let's go!

17:53.050 --> 17:54.490
If I'm not back
at the home by 9:00

17:54.550 --> 17:56.350
they declare me
legally dead

17:56.420 --> 17:57.620

my insurance.

Homer, this is
a terrible thing
that's happened.

18:01.690 --> 18:03.650
but we can't blame
ourselves.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.070
We can and will.

Children need
discipline.

You can ask any
syndicated advice

to see him again?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.190
Oh, my special little guy.
Mwah!

18:26.250 --> 18:27.960
We were so worried.

18:28.020 --> 18:30.090
It's great
to have you back, boy.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.880
We were afraid
we'd lost you.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.460
Welcome back, Bart.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.290
I'm sorry we had
such a terrible fight.

there something

to your sister?

18:40.600 --> 18:41.500
Okay.

18:41.570 --> 18:42.840
I'm sorry too.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.240
No, no, no,
that won't do at all.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.500
Yeah, boy.

18:46.570 --> 18:49.240
Get on your knees
and beg for forgiveness!

18:49.310 --> 18:50.780
Yeah, beg me, Bart.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.080
Beg me!

18:52.140 --> 18:55.240

please, forgive me.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, all right.

20:40.350 --> 20:41.320
Really? Did they cry?

20:41.390 --> 20:41.960
Yes.

20:42.020 --> 20:43.420
Whoa, bull's-eye.

20:43.490 --> 20:45.960
Bart, why did you burn
my centerpiece?

20:46.020 --> 20:47.180
Aw, come on.

20:47.260 --> 20:48.800
Was it because
you hate me

20:48.860 --> 20:52.030
- or because you're bad?
- I don't know.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.500
I don't know
why I did it.

20:53.560 --> 20:54.960
I don't know
why I enjoyed it

20:55.030 --> 20:55.730
and I don't know why

20:55.800 --> 20:56.700
I'll do it again.

20:56.770 --> 20:58.010
Just tell me
you're sorry.

20:58.070 --> 20:59.140
Why should I?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.330
Bart, the only reason
to apologize

21:01.410 --> 21:03.010
is if you look deep down

21:03.070 --> 21:04.230
<i>inside yourself</i>

21:04.310 --> 21:05.850
<i>and you find a spot.</i>

21:05.910 --> 21:08.320
<i>Something you wish
wasn't there.</i>

21:08.380 --> 21:12.050
Because you feel bad
you hurt your sister's feelings.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.050
Leave me alone.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.550
Just look!

21:14.620 --> 21:15.820
Okay, okay.

21:15.890 --> 21:20.990
( <i>muttering: )
Looking for the spot.</i>

21:21.060 --> 21:22.160
Still checking.

21:22.230 --> 21:23.630
This is so stupid.

21:23.690 --> 21:25.060
I'm not going
to find anything.

21:25.130 --> 21:27.300
Just because I wrecked something
she worked really hard on

21:27.370 --> 21:29.540
and I made her cr...

21:29.600 --> 21:31.200
Uh-oh.

21:33.340 --> 21:35.040
I'm sorry, Lisa.

21:35.110 --> 21:36.880
Apology accepted.

21:41.250 --> 21:44.680
You know, Marge,
we're great parents.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.650
Oh Lord, on this blessed day,
we thank thee

21:47.720 --> 21:51.360
for giving our family
one more crack at togetherness.

21:51.420 --> 21:53.050
All:
Amen.
