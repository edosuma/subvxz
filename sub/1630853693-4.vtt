WEBVTT

00:06.773 --> 00:09.943
( Cogliostro )
IS THE HELL SPAWN EVEN AWARE
THAT HIS PRESENCE

00:10.009 --> 00:12.011
CAUSES THE DESTRUCTION

00:12.078 --> 00:15.048
OF THOSE HE HAD HOPED
TO PROTECT ?

00:15.115 --> 00:17.584
THIS HAS BECOME A VERY
DANGEROUS SITUATION TO TERRY.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.219
HE'S NOT A CRIMINAL.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.720
YOU'VE ALREADY
LOST ONE HUSBAND,

00:20.787 --> 00:23.089
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
TO LOSE ANOTHER.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.559
WE OWN
THESE ALLEYS NOW.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.495
HELP, PLEASE !

00:28.561 --> 00:30.563
I TOLD EVERYBODY
THAT YOU'D PROTECT US !

00:30.630 --> 00:33.400
THIS PLACE HAS
THE STINK OF HELL ALL OVER IT.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.335
ARGH !!

00:36.269 --> 00:38.571
WHO ARE YOU ?!

00:45.111 --> 00:47.447
YOU'RE GONNA DIE !

00:54.154 --> 00:56.790
( Cogliostro )
HE KNOWS HE HAS
LOST AGAIN.

00:56.856 --> 01:00.226
THE REAL VICTOR HERE
IS THE ONE WHO SENT HIM

01:00.293 --> 01:04.097
TO HARVEST MORE SOULS.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.603
NO !!

02:01.087 --> 02:02.489
( babies crying )

02:06.125 --> 02:09.262
IT'S BEEN SAID
THAT EVIL IS PAIN

02:09.329 --> 02:12.432
DELIBERATELY INFLICTED
ON A SINGLE HUMAN BEING.

02:14.701 --> 02:19.372
BUT IF YOU WERE TO TAKE
THE POINTY WHITE HOOD
OFF THE KKK...

02:20.874 --> 02:24.010
OR STRIP THE SWASTIKA
OFF A STORM TROOPER...

02:24.077 --> 02:28.181
THESE MEN SO FILLED
WITH ANGER AND HATRED,

02:28.248 --> 02:31.351
THAT ACTUALLY LOOK
JUST LIKE OUR NEIGHBOR.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.952
SO I WONDER,

02:33.019 --> 02:35.555
IF THE DEVIL DOES EXIST
COULD HE HAVE BEEN MADE

02:35.622 --> 02:38.224
IN MAN'S OWN IMAGE
AND LIKENESS TOO ?

02:38.291 --> 02:41.294
AND WOULD HE LOOK
AS NORMAL AS YOU AND I ?

03:03.216 --> 03:06.052
( male )
THE DREAM
IS ALWAYS THE SAME.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.421
WE ARE PALE RIDERS
IN THE NIGHT,

03:08.488 --> 03:10.723
CARRYING THE SWORDS
OF JUSTICE...

03:10.790 --> 03:12.959
AS WAS DONE WHEN MEN
FIRST PUT ON THE HOODS

03:13.026 --> 03:15.128
AND SET
THE CROSS ON FIRE,

03:15.194 --> 03:18.264
FOR ALL TO SEE
AND FEAR...

03:18.331 --> 03:22.168
ONE MORE OF THE OUTSIDERS
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO JUSTICE,

03:22.235 --> 03:25.471
THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN
OUR HOMES AND JOBS,

03:25.538 --> 03:29.142
DEFILED OUR COUNTRY
AND OUR GOD.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.321
I KNOW NOW WHAT
THE DREAM REALLY MEANS.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.957
I AM TO
PREPARE THE WAY

03:44.023 --> 03:46.926
FOR THE ONE
WHO IS COMING.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.861
I SEE HIS FACE,
EVERY NIGHT.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.464
WE SHARE
THE SAME DREAM...

03:51.531 --> 03:54.434
THE MASTER TOLD ME
WHAT I HAD TO DO.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.037
HE SPEAKS TO ME,
AND I KNOW HIS NAME.

03:58.104 --> 04:01.307
HE CALLS HIMSELF
"MALEBOLGIA".

04:03.042 --> 04:06.179
PLEASE, SIR,
NO SMOKING IN CAB.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.514
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.049
NO PROBLEM.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.285
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TONIGHT ?

04:13.353 --> 04:14.354
HUH ?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.189
I'M GOING
TO BROOKLYN.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.524
BROOKLYN, OKAY.

04:22.161 --> 04:25.331
( male )
I AM THE ONE TO CLEANSE
AND PURIFY THIS CITY,

04:25.398 --> 04:27.500
TO RID US OF THEM.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.502
THEY'RE NOT LIKE US.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.537
BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY
HELP THEMSELVES...

04:31.604 --> 04:34.440
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY THIS MUST HAPPEN.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.075
( male )
PLEASE...

04:36.142 --> 04:38.444
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS ?

04:38.511 --> 04:40.680
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.218
I'M SORRY.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.021
I KNOW
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.457
AND IT'S REALLY
NOTHING PERSONAL.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.501
( Cogliostro )
IT IS NOT JUST THE LOST
AND DISPOSSESSED

05:35.568 --> 05:38.571
THAT HAVE GATHERED
NEAR THE HELL SPAWN.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.474
THERE ARE THOSE
LONE PREDATORS...

05:41.541 --> 05:43.943
THE HUMAN MONSTERS.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.946
THOSE WHO HAVE HEARD
THE VOICE OF MALEBOLGIA...

05:47.013 --> 05:49.348
WHISPERING TO THEM.

05:49.415 --> 05:52.819
EVIL HAS SEEPED
INTO THEIR EMPTY LIVES

05:52.885 --> 05:55.054
LIKE A STAINED LIQUID.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.857
AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF
THE HELL SPAWN,

05:57.924 --> 06:00.827
THEY COME TO THE ALLEYS
TO BE NEAR HIM.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.863
THEY ARE
DRAWN TO HIM.

06:03.930 --> 06:06.499
HE IS THEIR SAVIOR...

06:06.566 --> 06:09.202
THEIR LINK
TO THE MASTER.

06:09.268 --> 06:12.672
HELL HAS SENT THEM TO BE
MALEBOLGIA'S HANDS,

06:12.739 --> 06:14.707
COVERED WITH BLOOD...

06:14.774 --> 06:16.843
( male )
I'VE FOUND YOU.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.014
GET AWAY FROM ME.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.652
( Merrick )
A WOMAN MAKES IT HER BUSINESS
TO KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND IS.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.287
( Jason )
SHE KNOWS
SHE'S BEING WATCHED.

06:28.354 --> 06:29.989
WHY IS THIS WOMAN
STILL ALIVE ?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.557
LET ME TAKE HER,
AND THE KID,

06:31.624 --> 06:34.093
I'LL KNOW WHERE
FITZGERALD IS IN AN HOUR.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.195
AND IF SHE REALLY
DOESN'T KNOW,

06:36.262 --> 06:38.464
YOU WOULD'VE
CUT HER TO PIECES.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.266
I'LL FIND HIM,
DON'T WORRY.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.868
( phone ringing )

06:41.934 --> 06:43.035
YES ?

06:43.102 --> 06:45.438
YOU WANTED US
TO CHECK IN SIR ?

06:45.505 --> 06:47.573
YES, RAYMOND,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT ?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.375
SHE HASN'T LEFT
HER OFFICE ALL DAY.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.377
SHE SPOKE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER,
HER DAUGHTER,

06:51.444 --> 06:52.612
SEVERAL CLIENTS,

06:52.678 --> 06:54.180
and you.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.517
SHE'S CLEVER,
THIS ONE.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.086
( Merrick )
YOU KNOW I'M GOOD
IN VOICE STRESS ANALYSIS.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.221
LET ME BE THERE...
NEXT TO YOU.

07:02.288 --> 07:05.091
SHE'S NOT A PRO,
I'LL KNOW WHEN SHE'S LYING.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.194
IF I FEEL LIKE SHE'S LYING,
YOU CAN TAKE HER.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.163
( Merrick )
ASK HER ABOUT
HER DAUGHTER.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.098
IS SHE
MISSING DADDY ?

07:12.165 --> 07:15.368
A MOTHER WON'T LIE
ABOUT HER KID'S FEELINGS.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.214
WANDA ?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.384
IT'S AFTER NINE O'CLOCK,
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE ?

07:31.450 --> 07:33.753
I'VE GOT SOME BRIEFS
TO CATCH UP ON.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.722
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU DELEGATE
THE CASES TO SOMEONE ELSE ?

07:36.789 --> 07:39.425
AT LEAST 'TIL
YOU HEAR ABOUT TERRY.

07:39.492 --> 07:40.893
THANKS, LOIS,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.796
BUT I HAVE TO STAY BUSY
OR I'LL LOSE MY MIND FOR SURE.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.865
WELL, OKAY,
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

07:45.932 --> 07:49.168
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
LET ME KNOW, OKAY ?

07:49.235 --> 07:50.636
'NIGHT.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.738
GOODNIGHT, LOIS.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.157
( phone )

08:11.224 --> 08:14.026
WANDA BLAKE.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.094
Wanda...

08:15.161 --> 08:16.195
JASON WYNN.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.496
Jason,
anything new ?

08:17.563 --> 08:18.865
YES, CAN YOU MEET ME
FOR DINNER ?

08:18.931 --> 08:19.932
OF COURSE I CAN.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.634
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME
TO MEET YOU ?

08:21.701 --> 08:23.636
I'LL SEND A CAR AROUND
TO PICK YOU UP.

08:23.703 --> 08:24.871
Alright,

08:24.937 --> 08:26.906
I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS
IN TEN MINUTES.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.341
See you then.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.278
YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.346
NO SLEEP.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.349
I HAVE THE SAME DREAMS,
EVERY NIGHT.

08:45.524 --> 08:48.327
( reporter on tv )
There's been a recent
string of disappearances,

08:48.394 --> 08:50.563
all in the Brooklyn area.

08:50.630 --> 08:51.964
Police are investigating,

08:52.031 --> 08:53.366
but there are no leads
at this time,

08:53.432 --> 08:55.301
and they're asking
for the public's help.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.802
The most recent
disappearance

08:56.869 --> 08:59.272
is local cab driver,
Joseph Weiss.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.307
If you've seen this man,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.576
or have any information
as to his whereabouts,

09:03.643 --> 09:06.379
please call the number
on the screen.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.054
I CAN
GET THE MONEY.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.290
YEAH, I SWEAR.

09:17.356 --> 09:20.092
I'LL NEVER
DO IT AGAIN.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.895
PLEASE, PLEASE, BABY,
COME GET ME...

09:22.962 --> 09:24.864
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT ?

09:24.931 --> 09:26.532
FUCK OFF !

09:43.082 --> 09:44.116
( honking )

09:52.024 --> 09:53.759
ASTORIA, QUEENS,
PLEASE.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.963
ASTORIA, IT IS.

10:01.634 --> 10:05.571
OH, THANK YOU, HONEY,
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:05.638 --> 10:07.740
SO ARE YOU.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.276
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY,
BABY.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.386
HEY, EXCUSE ME,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.922
ASTORIA IN QUEENS,
NOT BROOKLYN.

10:22.989 --> 10:25.591
I'M SORRY, THE TRAFFIC
ON THE TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE IS--

10:25.658 --> 10:27.626
WHAT DO WE LOOK LIKE ?
TOURISTS ?

10:27.693 --> 10:29.295
STOP THE CAB !

10:31.197 --> 10:33.299
I SAID

10:33.366 --> 10:36.268
STOP THE CAB RIGHT NOW
AND LET US OUT !

10:44.510 --> 10:46.379
HEY MAN, LOOK.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.981
I ONLY GOT 50 BUCKS,
IT'S YOURS.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.817
JUST LET US
OUT HERE, OKAY ?

10:53.519 --> 10:56.922
( driver )
I APOLOGIZE, BUT IT HAS
TO BE THIS WAY.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.558
( male )
DON'T, NO PLEASE,
DON'T !

10:59.625 --> 11:00.926
( gunshot )

11:01.961 --> 11:03.496
( gunshots )

11:39.398 --> 11:41.700
I REALLY AM SORRY.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.891
AS HIS LAWYER,
I'D LIKE TO KNOW

12:05.958 --> 12:07.860
IF MY HUSBAND IS BEING
CHARGED WITH A CRIME.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.129
I THINK THIS CAN BE RESOLVED
IN TERRY'S FAVOR.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.664
DON'T GET
MY HOPES UP, JASON,

12:11.730 --> 12:13.265
UNLESS YOU ARE SURE.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.501
I'LL ALWAYS TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, WANDA.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.169
SO, HOW ARE YOU
MAKING OUT ?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.270
HOW'S CYAN ?

12:18.337 --> 12:20.406
IT'S TOUGH
ON A KID.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.641
SHE CRIES FOR TERRY
EVERY NIGHT,

12:22.708 --> 12:24.844
AND I TRY TO
STAY BUSY AT WORK,

12:24.910 --> 12:27.913
AND TRY TO KEEP MYSELF
TOGETHER FOR HER,

12:27.980 --> 12:30.282
BUT I DO MY OWN
SHARE OF CRYING.

12:30.349 --> 12:33.385
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DUMP MY PROBLEMS ON YOU.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.821
IT'S ALRIGHT, WANDA,
I KNOW IT'S TOUGH.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.524
BUT I'LL BE HERE AS LONG AS
YOU NEED ME TO BE.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.392
I JUST WANT
TERRY HOME.

12:40.459 --> 12:42.595
SO DO I.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.410
( male )
IS THAT HIM ?

12:58.477 --> 13:00.880
IS THAT
THE ONE YOU WANT ?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.264
( phone ringing )

13:18.330 --> 13:19.498
( beeping )

13:21.700 --> 13:22.735
( gasping )

13:24.203 --> 13:25.538
PROBLEM ?

13:25.604 --> 13:28.574
NO, NO, I'VE JUST
GOT TO MAKE A CALL.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.943
YOU CAN
USE MY PHONE.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.112
UH, NO,
THANK YOU.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.347
THIS IS
A PRIVATE CALL.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.149
I'LL USE ONE OF
THE PAY PHONES.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.284
EXCUSE ME.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.223
SHE'S LYING.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.829
( dialing )

13:53.365 --> 13:54.166
WANDA.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.634
Terry,
where are you ?

13:55.701 --> 13:57.937
OUR OLD CLUB
IN BROOKLYN.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.939
I CAN BE THERE
IN 30 MINUTES.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.507
I'll be waiting
in front.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.410
TERRY, I LOVE YOU.

14:04.476 --> 14:06.679
I LOVE YOU TOO.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.287
I'M SORRY.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.323
CYAN'S NOT FEELING WELL,
I HAVE TO GO.

14:17.389 --> 14:20.025
I HOPE
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.027
SHE'S BEEN RUNNING
A HIGH FEVER.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.563
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING,
I'LL TAKE A CAB.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.699
NO, NO, NO,
I WOULDN'T HEAR OF IT.

14:26.765 --> 14:27.967
MERRICK,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.903
WILL YOU SEE MISS BLAKE
TO THE CAR PLEASE ?

14:30.970 --> 14:32.538
ALRIGHT.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.106
NO PROBLEM,
MA'AM.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.141
I'LL CALL YOU,
JASON.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.245
GOODNIGHT, WANDA.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.713
BE CAREFUL.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.371
TRACED HER CALL TO
A PAY PHONE IN BROOKLYN.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.673
( phone ringing )

15:12.378 --> 15:14.546
WHERE IS SHE NOW ?

15:14.613 --> 15:17.449
ON THE MANHATTAN BRIDGE,
HEADING INTO BROOKLYN.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.686
( Jason )
Keep me posted.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.572
( rustling )

15:58.090 --> 16:00.326
( flies buzzing )

16:24.116 --> 16:26.852
OH, YOU'RE AWAKE,
THAT'S BETTER.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.400
PLEASE FORGIVE ALL THIS.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.802
I REALLY
DON'T BLAME YOU.

16:43.869 --> 16:46.672
AND NONE OF US
CHOOSES

16:46.739 --> 16:49.274
WHAT WE ARE BORN TO BE.

17:33.619 --> 17:34.586
( phone )

17:35.487 --> 17:36.789
YES.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.424
EXCELLENT.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.559
BROOKLYN...
INTERESTING.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.797
ONE OF FITZGERALD'S CREDIT CARDS
WAS JUST TRACED IN BROOKLYN.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.499
THAT SONOFABITCH HAS BEEN
IN OUR BACKYARD ALL THIS TIME,

17:47.566 --> 17:50.135
AND BLAKE IS ON
HER WAY THERE NOW.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.488
( phone )

18:09.555 --> 18:10.589
WHAT ?

18:10.656 --> 18:13.192
She keeps circling
the same couple of blocks

18:13.258 --> 18:14.660
REAL SLOW.

18:14.726 --> 18:15.994
Pull her over.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.496
Hold her
'til I get there.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.145
OH, NO !

18:47.059 --> 18:48.794
PLEASE STEP OUT
OF THE CAR.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.195
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT ?

18:50.262 --> 18:52.464
PLEASE, DON'T MAKE
THIS DIFFICULT.

18:52.531 --> 18:54.199
WHO ARE YOU ?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

18:54.266 --> 18:56.001
GET OUT
OF THE CAR.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.135
( doors locking )

18:57.202 --> 18:58.303
NO, I WON'T.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.405
LISTEN LADY,
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.840
( engine choking )

19:03.208 --> 19:04.576
( rustling )

19:15.387 --> 19:17.322
WATTS,
GO CHECK IT OUT.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.395
( engine choking )

19:23.462 --> 19:25.764
PLEASE GET OUT
OF THE CAR, MISS.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.802
WATTS,

19:32.237 --> 19:34.907
YEAH, NOTHING.

19:36.208 --> 19:37.676

19:52.491 --> 19:53.625
OH, GOD !

20:18.317 --> 20:19.785

20:19.851 --> 20:22.020
OH, NO, NO !

20:25.691 --> 20:28.026
NO, NO, NO !

20:28.093 --> 20:29.795
NO, NO !

20:31.496 --> 20:33.599
COME ON !

20:33.665 --> 20:35.634
( engine choking )

20:39.137 --> 20:40.305
COME ON !

20:43.775 --> 20:44.810
OH...

20:50.415 --> 20:51.650
NO !

20:51.717 --> 20:55.721
NO, NO !

20:55.787 --> 20:57.022

WANDA... !!

21:21.313 --> 21:23.382
ARGH... !!

21:31.023 --> 21:34.726
I'M SORRY, I TOOK A BIT
LONGER THAN I EXPECTED.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.636
OH, NO.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.378
THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO
HAPPEN THIS WAY.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.049
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE...

21:57.115 --> 22:00.185
'CAUSE THERE'S
NO PLACE TO GO.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.124
YOU FUCKED
WITH THE WRONG GUY.

22:17.602 --> 22:19.671
YOU SICK
LITTLE TWIRP !

22:27.846 --> 22:30.182
COME ON OUT.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.317
IT'S TIME TO TAKE YOUR PLACE
AMONG THE OTHERS.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.535
HE TOLD ME IT HAS
TO BE THIS WAY.

23:31.543 --> 23:34.346
DOES HE THINK
HE CAN FUCK WITH ME ?

23:34.412 --> 23:36.281
WITH MY PLANS ?

23:41.386 --> 23:44.356
( Spawn )
YOU'D HAVE KILLED HER TOO,
IF YOU HAD THE CHANCE.

23:44.422 --> 23:46.458
WHO'S THAT ?

23:46.525 --> 23:48.927
WHO'S THERE ?

23:50.095 --> 23:53.198
( Merrick )
I HAVE A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

23:57.702 --> 24:01.273
WHERE THE HELL
ARE RAYMOND AND WATTS ?

24:02.207 --> 24:04.543
DO YOU SEE
WHAT I'VE DONE HERE ?

24:04.609 --> 24:07.279
THIS WAS FOR THE MASTER,
I'VE SAVED THEM FOR YOU.

24:07.345 --> 24:10.415
( Spawn )
I DON'T
SERVE ANY MASTER.

24:13.218 --> 24:16.087
DO YOU THINK OUR MASTER
WILL BE PLEASED ?

24:16.154 --> 24:18.290
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF ?

24:18.356 --> 24:20.559
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO MEET HIM.

25:03.268 --> 25:05.437
MY DREAM...

25:11.276 --> 25:14.646
( male )
MY SAVIOR...
HE BETRAYED ME.
