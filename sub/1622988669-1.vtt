01:10.226 --> 01:11.228
What do you think?

01:15.365 --> 01:16.700
I don't know.

01:16.734 --> 01:17.802
Hmm?

01:19.303 --> 01:20.538
What do you think?

01:21.771 --> 01:22.841
Who, me?

01:25.609 --> 01:28.412
Oh, I think you look
just perfect.

01:28.445 --> 01:30.747
I can see why my little boy
is head over heels for you.

01:33.249 --> 01:34.251
Yeah.

01:35.586 --> 01:36.654
Perfect.

01:39.756 --> 01:41.225
That's the problem.

01:41.258 --> 01:42.494
Isn't perfect a good thing?

01:46.729 --> 01:49.133
It just doesn't look like me.

01:50.934 --> 01:52.936
I'm just saying,
when someone gets murdered,

01:52.969 --> 01:54.638
they investigate
the spouse first.

01:54.672 --> 01:56.674
That tells you everything
you need to know about marriage.

01:56.707 --> 01:59.677
Come on, guys. Marriage brings
a lot of great things into your life.

01:59.710 --> 02:03.514
Like, uh, come on, guys.
Help me.

02:03.547 --> 02:05.883
- Feminine hygiene products.
- Empty wallets.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.284
They take over
the bathroom.

02:07.318 --> 02:11.623
And they withhold sex until you're
in, like, actual physical pain.

02:13.356 --> 02:14.359
I mean, so I've heard.

02:18.329 --> 02:19.430
You guys done?

02:19.462 --> 02:22.332
Are we all done being jealous?

02:22.366 --> 02:24.202
- Are you guys done being jealous?
- Yup.

02:24.235 --> 02:26.437
I was wondering where everyone
was hanging out for a smoke.

02:26.469 --> 02:27.906
Yep, I think we're all done.

02:29.807 --> 02:31.543
Sorry, sir,
you can't smoke up here.

02:43.653 --> 02:45.522
Want one?

02:45.556 --> 02:47.558
No, no, you really can't
smoke in here, though.

02:47.591 --> 02:48.826
It's ah, policy.

02:54.765 --> 02:56.901
Can't smoke anywhere these days.

02:56.933 --> 03:00.437
And you guys think everyone of my
generation who smokes is an idiot.

03:00.470 --> 03:02.573
- I never said that.
- Yeah, but you're thinking it.

03:02.605 --> 03:03.942
Hey, I get it.

03:04.807 --> 03:06.476
Smoke is not your vice.

03:08.011 --> 03:09.847
I'm sure you have other vices.

03:09.879 --> 03:11.915
Come on, out with it.

03:11.949 --> 03:13.718
Chewing tobacco.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.222
No, you are not the type.

03:18.455 --> 03:19.823
A little too much alcohol.

03:19.856 --> 03:22.859
Probably drank your way through
college with your buddies, right?

03:22.892 --> 03:23.961
Or is it pot?

03:25.428 --> 03:26.931
You like that wacky weed, Noah?

03:29.867 --> 03:32.604
Yeah. Pot's not that bad,
I guess.

03:33.937 --> 03:34.973
I tried it once.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.277
God, that was a long time ago.

03:39.309 --> 03:42.279
You know that
whole munchies thing, it's true.

03:42.313 --> 03:43.914
You smoked pot.

03:43.946 --> 03:46.016
I'm not the total square
you think I am.

03:47.318 --> 03:49.354
You did just use
the word square, though.

03:54.825 --> 03:59.297
But, you know,
people grow up, Noah.

03:59.330 --> 04:03.034
And when they grow up, they usually
learn that grownups aren't all idiots.

04:05.402 --> 04:06.470
My point is...

04:08.372 --> 04:09.940
The foundation of a marriage is

04:09.974 --> 04:13.444
how are you going to support each other,
raise a family, that sort of thing.

04:13.476 --> 04:16.579
And you, you do not have a plan.

04:18.447 --> 04:20.649
Sir, I'm going to grad school
in the fall.

04:20.683 --> 04:21.986
Grad school.

04:22.019 --> 04:24.088
To be a filmmaker.

04:24.121 --> 04:26.690
That's not a plan, son,
that's a fantasy.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.327
How many filmmakers
are there in the world?

04:29.359 --> 04:30.427
Quite a few.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.529
And how many can buy
a home and raise a family?

04:32.563 --> 04:33.897
How many put that family first?

04:36.099 --> 04:38.335
Sir, this might sound,

04:38.368 --> 04:39.871
I don't know,
pretentious, but...

04:42.472 --> 04:44.775
I want to change the world.

04:44.808 --> 04:47.344
Or whatever part of it
I can impact.

04:47.378 --> 04:49.380
And I feel like I can do that
through film.

04:50.447 --> 04:51.482
Look son,

04:53.750 --> 04:57.087
I don't have a problem with you wanting
to make movies. I mean, whatever.

04:57.121 --> 04:58.690
I guess someone has to do that.

05:00.556 --> 05:02.960
But it doesn't have to be
the guy married to my daughter.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.464
Now...

05:06.496 --> 05:08.131
I need to lay down
some hard truth on you

05:08.164 --> 05:11.868
that you may not be ready to
hear, but it's truth nonetheless.

05:11.902 --> 05:14.003
And I'm a dad,
so I have to say it.

05:14.037 --> 05:16.440
Noah, you know me.

05:16.472 --> 05:18.775
And you know how much I care
about my daughter.

05:19.876 --> 05:21.211
You know,
I want the best for her

05:21.245 --> 05:24.349
and I believe that you want the
best for her, too. I really do.

05:26.916 --> 05:30.421
So that's why we've got to talk
about how difficult it is

05:30.453 --> 05:34.791
for someone like her to be married
to someone of another color.

05:36.193 --> 05:39.496
You know, I'm not a racist,
that's not my issue.

05:40.897 --> 05:42.767
These are difficult times
we live in

05:42.799 --> 05:44.934
and I just worry about
what her life will be like

05:44.967 --> 05:47.670
and the lives of kids
you might have together.

05:47.703 --> 05:51.775
What's it like for mixed race
children out there these days?

05:51.808 --> 05:55.412
You don't want her children to start
out life with a disadvantage, do you?

05:56.746 --> 05:57.948
I know you love her

05:57.981 --> 05:59.183
and you want
what's best for her.

05:59.215 --> 06:01.017
I want what's best for her too.

06:01.051 --> 06:03.921
I'm willing to throw away all the
money I've spent on this wedding

06:03.953 --> 06:05.589
because I want
what's best for her.

06:06.789 --> 06:08.092
So I want you to think about,

06:08.125 --> 06:11.529
really think about
what's best from Madison.

06:12.229 --> 06:14.198
If you really love her,

06:14.231 --> 06:15.832
you'll do the right thing.

06:18.034 --> 06:19.169
Okay?

06:22.072 --> 06:23.474
Yeah.

06:23.507 --> 06:24.542
Okay.

06:32.916 --> 06:33.918
Good talk.

06:48.498 --> 06:49.499
Who is it?

06:50.234 --> 06:51.436
It's me.

06:52.769 --> 06:53.771
What do you want?

06:58.140 --> 06:59.142
I don't know.

07:02.746 --> 07:04.181
Turn around.

07:04.214 --> 07:06.150
- What?
- Turn around.

07:06.183 --> 07:07.418
Why?

07:07.450 --> 07:09.919
Because I don't want to talk
to you through a closed window,

07:09.952 --> 07:13.022
but I also don't want you
to see me before the ceremony.

07:13.056 --> 07:14.123
Really?

07:14.157 --> 07:15.560
Yes, really.

07:17.594 --> 07:19.063
All right,
I'm turned around.

07:25.801 --> 07:26.871
You okay?

07:28.938 --> 07:30.808
Are you sure you want
to marry me?

07:30.840 --> 07:32.976
What? Of course, I am.

07:34.111 --> 07:36.146
Are you sure
you want to marry me?

07:36.178 --> 07:37.748
I want you to be happy.

07:39.582 --> 07:42.652
That's why
we're getting married.

07:42.686 --> 07:45.255
You're not worried
about our life together?

07:45.289 --> 07:50.060
I'm anxious about
starting our life together.

07:50.092 --> 07:51.729
What you talking about?

07:53.262 --> 07:56.267
Is being married to a Black man
gonna be too difficult for us?

07:56.299 --> 07:58.134
Noah,

07:58.167 --> 07:59.703
we talked about this.

08:00.671 --> 08:01.806
Where is this coming from?

08:02.738 --> 08:04.075
Did my dad talk to you?

08:06.609 --> 08:07.744
I'm gonna kill him.

08:07.777 --> 08:09.946
Better yet, I'm gonna get Mom
to kill him.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.616
I thought he was over this.

08:13.150 --> 08:16.654
My dad's views are my problem.

08:18.255 --> 08:19.991
They're sort of my problem now.

08:22.758 --> 08:24.662
I didn't want them
to be your problem.

08:24.695 --> 08:26.863
Can't pretend like
there's not gonna be an issue.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.099
I'm gonna see him
at thanksgiving,

08:29.132 --> 08:32.035
family gatherings
all the time.

08:32.068 --> 08:34.270
Not all the time.

08:34.303 --> 08:36.908
Probably, hardly ever see
our parents.

08:42.178 --> 08:44.015
Do you really think
he's a racist?

08:46.750 --> 08:47.985
Don't you?

08:49.285 --> 08:51.655
He raised me and I'm not racist.

08:55.891 --> 08:56.893
Noah,

08:57.827 --> 08:58.828
he's my dad.

09:00.163 --> 09:01.198
I love him.

09:01.231 --> 09:03.299
I don't like what he believes,

09:03.332 --> 09:05.669
but I can't just
stop loving him.

09:06.770 --> 09:07.771
I'm not asking you to.

09:12.074 --> 09:13.309
But what if he's right?

09:13.342 --> 09:15.011
He's not right.

09:15.044 --> 09:16.746
He's right that it won't be
easy for us.

09:16.779 --> 09:19.949
So, Black and white people
can never be together?

09:19.982 --> 09:22.719
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Then what are you saying?

09:25.355 --> 09:27.324
I don't know. I'm...

09:27.356 --> 09:29.927
I'm just trying to figure out
how all this is gonna work.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.962
Aren't you?

09:34.264 --> 09:37.801
Yeah, sometimes.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.770
Can you imagine our families
at thanksgiving dinner together?

09:42.838 --> 09:45.808
It'll be like the meeting of the
five families in <i> The Godfather.</i>

09:45.842 --> 09:50.081
I can't really imagine that because
I have never seen <i> The Godfather.</i>

09:51.448 --> 09:52.949
Madison.

09:52.982 --> 09:55.084
I don't like old movies.

09:55.117 --> 09:58.087
You know, I was worried about
the whole Black man

09:58.121 --> 10:00.289
married to
a white woman thing, but

10:00.323 --> 10:04.227
now I'm worried about being married
to a woman that knows nothing about

10:04.260 --> 10:06.097
one of the classics
in modern cinema.

10:12.836 --> 10:13.938
Take my hand, Noah.

10:21.310 --> 10:24.648
I'm not giving up just because
this is going to be hard.

10:25.848 --> 10:27.150
Of course it's gonna be hard.

10:28.952 --> 10:32.088
I didn't expect it
to happen right now, but fine.

10:33.823 --> 10:35.159
We'll face it together.

10:37.827 --> 10:39.963
Because there's no one else
I want to face it with

10:42.432 --> 10:44.769
and because I can't face it
without you.

10:47.904 --> 10:50.106
We're not doing
this for them.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.909
We're doing it for us.

10:54.276 --> 10:57.814
So, you know, let's...
Let's do it right here.

10:59.381 --> 11:00.416
Do what right here?

11:00.449 --> 11:02.285
Get married.

11:02.318 --> 11:03.886
In a bathroom?

11:03.919 --> 11:05.988
Well, me in the bathroom,
you out there.

11:06.021 --> 11:07.790
Why don't I just come in there?

11:07.823 --> 11:09.092
Or you come out here.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.294
Because we're still going to do
the whole ceremony after this,

11:11.327 --> 11:14.997
but right here,
right now is for us.

11:15.030 --> 11:16.265
You sure about this?

11:16.299 --> 11:22.438
Do you Noah, take me, Madison,
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

11:22.472 --> 11:26.210
to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish to...

11:27.910 --> 11:29.779
hold my head when I vomit,

11:29.813 --> 11:31.749
like, when we had those tacos
from taco truck

11:31.781 --> 11:33.950
and then you made me ride
that rollercoaster

11:33.983 --> 11:36.386
that you said wouldn't be
too intense,

11:37.853 --> 11:42.025
to not care when
I want to sleep in all day

11:42.058 --> 11:44.928
even if we had plans,

11:44.961 --> 11:50.000
to pick up after me
because I hate folding clothes

11:50.033 --> 11:52.402
and putting them away,

11:52.434 --> 11:57.473
to be okay with me
occasionally making us late

11:57.506 --> 12:00.176
because I'm ready to leave,
when I'm ready to leave.

12:01.845 --> 12:05.916
To remember what you love
most about me,

12:05.948 --> 12:07.217
right in the middle of a fight

12:08.052 --> 12:12.422
and to support me as
I pursue my dream

12:12.454 --> 12:15.058
of becoming
a professional ballerina.

12:16.393 --> 12:17.428
I do.

12:19.395 --> 12:25.169
And do you, Madison, take me,
Noah, with all of my baggage,

12:25.202 --> 12:29.139
even though I'm a mama's boy
who thinks he's always right,

12:29.172 --> 12:32.409
promise not to get upset with me
when I pee with the seat down,

12:32.442 --> 12:35.513
because I promise that I will
clean it up if I miss.

12:36.980 --> 12:38.215
To...

12:39.515 --> 12:41.952
let me keep the thermostat
at 70 degrees,

12:41.985 --> 12:43.921
even if that means
you need to get under a blanket,

12:44.621 --> 12:48.991
and to give me space

12:49.025 --> 12:51.795
when I'm in a crappy mood
for no reason at all,

12:53.196 --> 12:57.334
and to never withhold sex

12:57.366 --> 12:59.336
as a weapon,
which I'm not saying

12:59.369 --> 13:00.571
you would do
something like that.

13:00.603 --> 13:03.106
I just, you know,
I heard that could happen.

13:04.573 --> 13:05.575
Uh...

13:06.776 --> 13:10.880
And to support me in my dreams
of becoming a great filmmaker

13:12.115 --> 13:13.350
who changes the world.

13:14.451 --> 13:15.452
I do.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.289
I always did.

13:21.223 --> 13:22.491
I hope you washed
this hand.

13:32.302 --> 13:36.306
Okay, so remember, you guys
come from two very different worlds.

13:36.338 --> 13:38.941
All right, so what we want to do
is they really want to hit that

13:38.975 --> 13:42.346
and kind of feel that difficulty
and that separation between the two.

13:42.379 --> 13:45.349
I think we get it.
You want us to talk at each other

13:45.381 --> 13:47.351
- but not with each other.
- Yes, exactly.

13:47.384 --> 13:50.387
That's exactly we want. So, at this
point, we're trying to figure out

13:50.419 --> 13:52.588
if these people can get past
what they're supposed

13:52.621 --> 13:55.391
to think about each other
and really hear one another.

13:55.424 --> 13:56.959
You know? Really, really listen.

13:56.992 --> 13:59.195
You know, so what,
there has to be conflict.

13:59.228 --> 14:00.963
You know,
they're really passionate

14:00.996 --> 14:02.131
about what they believe.

14:02.164 --> 14:04.433
Great. Let's run
the scene again.

14:04.467 --> 14:05.401
Yes. Great idea.

14:05.434 --> 14:07.470
- We can do that. Absolutely.
- Noah?

14:07.504 --> 14:08.906
One second.

14:08.938 --> 14:09.972
What's up?

14:10.005 --> 14:11.073
I was just about
to come find you.

14:11.106 --> 14:12.641
We're actually going to run
the scene one more time,

14:12.675 --> 14:16.246
- I think we're ready to shoot so if you want to get everybody...
- No we won't.

14:16.279 --> 14:18.381
- What do you mean?
- Audio.

14:18.414 --> 14:20.384
- What about audio?
- They got a paying gig

14:20.417 --> 14:24.288
and they said, that you said, that you
wouldn't hold them back if one came.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.124
I didn't say they could just take
off without giving us any notice.

14:28.390 --> 14:31.627
Okay. Call them, tell them
we will fire them.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.429
We've had this scheduled
for weeks.

14:33.462 --> 14:35.531
I tried that, they don't care.

14:35.564 --> 14:37.233
You're paying them in meals
and credit

14:37.266 --> 14:40.069
and this other gig's
paying them in actual cash.

14:41.371 --> 14:44.707
All right, uh, B roll,
we got B roll to shoot here, right?

14:44.741 --> 14:47.476
I'll get started on that while you
track down some more audio people.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.679
- I know it's last minute...
- That leads us to our second problem.

14:49.712 --> 14:52.049
The bar owner has
changed his mind.

14:52.082 --> 14:53.250
Why?

14:54.217 --> 14:55.686
Maybe he finally read the script

14:55.718 --> 14:58.654
and didn't appreciate his place
being described as

14:58.688 --> 15:03.327
and I quote, "A dive where people go to
get drunk and avoid making eye contact."

15:03.360 --> 15:04.962
That was in draft three.

15:04.995 --> 15:07.965
We clearly updated the script
to make it a nicer place.

15:07.997 --> 15:10.166
Maybe you should have sent
the more recent version.

15:11.768 --> 15:13.637
Tell him that we will make sure

15:13.669 --> 15:15.338
that the bar's name
isn't mentioned.

15:15.371 --> 15:17.540
I suggested that,
it didn't change his mind.

15:18.707 --> 15:20.043
He can't do this.

15:20.076 --> 15:22.212
We have a signed agreement,
right?

15:22.245 --> 15:24.347
We do, but he's still
kicking us out.

15:24.380 --> 15:27.250
Isn't the signed agreement, isn't
that, like a contract or something?

15:27.283 --> 15:29.318
- Yeah, it is.
- So enforce the contract.

15:29.351 --> 15:32.021
But unless you want to take him
to court right now,

15:32.054 --> 15:35.558
you cannot force him to do
anything he does not want to do.

15:35.592 --> 15:38.028
And you can't actually
take him to court right now,

15:38.060 --> 15:39.628
I wasn't being serious
about that.

15:39.661 --> 15:41.030
That's not helping.

15:41.063 --> 15:42.598
Just trying
to keep things light,

15:42.631 --> 15:45.234
but we do have to leave now.

15:46.602 --> 15:48.237
Well, what are we gonna do?

15:48.270 --> 15:51.507
Loose a day of shooting,
at least a day, maybe more.

15:51.540 --> 15:54.176
At least until we find
a new bar.

15:54.209 --> 15:56.546
I'll get everyone to start
striking everything in here.

15:58.414 --> 15:59.415
You okay?

16:00.449 --> 16:01.451
Noah?

16:02.251 --> 16:03.652
Yeah. Okay.

16:03.685 --> 16:05.020
Okay.

16:05.053 --> 16:07.725
Okay, everyone.
We'll strike this location immediately...

16:15.564 --> 16:18.734
Hi. I was planning on coming in
for today's audition,

16:18.768 --> 16:21.204
but I couldn't get anyone
to cover my class,

16:21.236 --> 16:25.174
so I was hoping there might be
some other times available?

16:28.577 --> 16:29.645
Yes, I understand.

16:29.678 --> 16:34.418
Um, are there maybe
any other auditions coming up?

16:38.188 --> 16:39.188
Right.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.725
Okay. Thank you.

16:49.332 --> 16:52.269
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

16:53.569 --> 16:55.638
<i>Changement, changement,</i>

16:55.672 --> 16:58.275
<i>chaine, pique,</i>

16:58.308 --> 17:00.443
<i>sous sous, plie.</i>

17:01.244 --> 17:03.413
Okay, ready?

17:03.446 --> 17:06.315
Come on, girls. Everyone on your feet.
Let's start learning this.

17:06.348 --> 17:07.684
- Come on.
- Miss Maddie,

17:07.717 --> 17:09.152
I need to go to the bathroom.

17:10.486 --> 17:11.821
Okay, Laney. Come on.

17:11.854 --> 17:13.556
Starting in fifth position,
girls.

17:17.326 --> 17:18.594
What are you doing here?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.664
Location.

17:20.696 --> 17:22.665
Location bailed on us and we lost
an entire day in the schedule

17:22.698 --> 17:24.367
and I don't know
what we're gonna do.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.303
I am so sorry. That's terrible.

17:27.336 --> 17:29.238
I'll have to talk to
you about it later.

17:29.272 --> 17:32.342
Wait, Maddie,
I need you right now.

17:35.544 --> 17:36.846
I'm working.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.747
I have to get back to my class.

17:38.781 --> 17:41.717
And I need to figure this out.
My entire film is collapsing.

17:42.851 --> 17:44.188
Not right now.

18:04.940 --> 18:06.209
Yeah.

18:07.944 --> 18:09.513
Hey, Mom, I gotta call you back.

18:10.813 --> 18:13.283
Yeah, I love you too.

18:17.754 --> 18:19.456
So, does your mom know
every word

18:19.488 --> 18:22.491
spoken between us
or just the highlights?

18:22.525 --> 18:23.759
She called me.

18:23.793 --> 18:25.195
Really?

18:25.227 --> 18:26.263
For what?

18:26.295 --> 18:28.465
Hmm.

18:28.497 --> 18:31.567
She's calling to see if you got
that birthday money she sent

18:31.601 --> 18:33.203
because she never heard
from you.

18:34.469 --> 18:35.505
Mm-hmm.

18:40.709 --> 18:41.711
Welcome home.

18:46.682 --> 18:48.351
I'll just pick this up
for you.

18:49.986 --> 18:52.389
Put it on the bed with the
rest of the stuff on the floor.

18:59.996 --> 19:01.198
How was your day?

19:02.465 --> 19:03.467
Fine.

19:06.002 --> 19:07.704
Would you like to know
how my day was?

19:09.005 --> 19:11.207
Pretty sure I know
how your day was.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.808
Oh, you were listening.

19:12.842 --> 19:16.313
Well, it was kind of hard not to
when you showed up where I work.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.550
I do have a job, you know?

19:20.383 --> 19:22.318
I thought you might be
between classes.

19:22.951 --> 19:23.953
But I wasn't.

19:25.787 --> 19:28.191
You couldn't stop
and talk to me for five minutes.

19:41.938 --> 19:44.774
We never have anything to eat
in this apartment.

19:44.806 --> 19:45.874
Is that directed at me?

19:45.908 --> 19:47.611
How would that
be directed at you?

19:47.643 --> 19:49.813
Because I'm not working
while finishing this film.

19:52.348 --> 19:53.582
Just order a pizza.

19:53.615 --> 19:56.619
- We can't afford to order pizza.
- Because I'm not working

19:56.652 --> 19:59.789
- while finishing this film.
- Because we just can't, that's all.

20:03.592 --> 20:04.727
What do you want from me?

20:05.461 --> 20:07.029
I'm trying to finish this film,

20:07.063 --> 20:10.499
it could be my break
and everything is falling apart.

20:10.533 --> 20:14.471
What do I want from you? I want you
to have some respect for my job.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.406
But how would you like it if I...

20:16.438 --> 20:19.642
You don't even like your damn job.
You complain about it all the time.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.445
Okay, first off, please don't
talk to me like that.

20:22.477 --> 20:24.781
And yeah, I don't even like
my job because

20:24.813 --> 20:27.417
it wasn't supposed to be
my job forever.

20:27.449 --> 20:29.451
What happened to our deal?

20:29.485 --> 20:32.322
You get to do what you love,
every day.

20:32.354 --> 20:33.522
What are you talking about?

20:33.555 --> 20:35.725
You get to be around dance,
every day.

20:35.757 --> 20:37.760
That... that's not
the same thing.

20:37.794 --> 20:41.497
And whether I like my job or not
is not the point.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.500
When you bust in

20:43.533 --> 20:46.369
and act like I should stop
everything I'm doing.

20:46.401 --> 20:48.705
I mean, how dare you?

20:48.737 --> 20:51.373
Madison, you're my wife.

20:51.407 --> 20:53.610
- I can't stop by work and see you?
- Give me a break.

20:53.642 --> 20:54.777
Stop by work and...

20:54.811 --> 20:59.916
You demanded my attention
and completely embarrassed me.

20:59.948 --> 21:02.351
I would never do that to you.

21:04.553 --> 21:06.456
I can't lose any of
these classes.

21:06.488 --> 21:07.990
Our budget is tight enough
as it is.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.928
How much are you getting
per class again?

21:15.965 --> 21:18.935
All I'm saying is that maybe
you should ask for a raise.

21:18.967 --> 21:23.073
I am the newest person there,
not including the interns.

21:23.105 --> 21:25.608
I cannot ask for
a raise already.

21:27.008 --> 21:28.944
But you could get
a part time job.

21:28.977 --> 21:30.346
Not this again.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.650
I am not making enough
to pay the bills.

21:34.816 --> 21:37.753
We're going more
and more into debt.

21:37.786 --> 21:40.556
And I had to miss another
audition today

21:40.590 --> 21:44.361
because I'm the only one
bringing in any money.

21:44.393 --> 21:45.694
We talked about this.

21:45.727 --> 21:47.063
I have to finish this film.

21:47.095 --> 21:50.833
I cannot change the schedule
right now and go and get some job.

21:50.867 --> 21:52.969
But you can work somewhere
that pays you better.

21:54.836 --> 21:55.905
Noah...

21:56.906 --> 21:57.908
Honey...

21:59.775 --> 22:05.114
I am thrilled that
you're pursuing your passion.

22:05.148 --> 22:07.484
You know, it's one of
the reasons we're together.

22:07.516 --> 22:11.587
I love that you're trying to do
important things with art.

22:15.525 --> 22:18.461
But I am just
as important as that.

22:20.662 --> 22:24.900
We are just
as important as that.

22:46.589 --> 22:47.858
And Noah,

22:49.158 --> 22:50.794
don't drink anymore tonight.

22:52.027 --> 22:53.028
Okay?

22:56.032 --> 22:57.434
Yeah, okay.

26:03.218 --> 26:05.054
I thought
you'd be asleep by now.

26:07.689 --> 26:09.092
Wanted to get some work done.

26:10.959 --> 26:11.961
Ended up writing.

26:14.429 --> 26:15.698
Changes on the film?

26:16.666 --> 26:17.867
Langston Hughes Bio.

26:19.968 --> 26:21.938
When you finish that,
it's gonna be awesome.

26:23.773 --> 26:26.175
I have to face the facts
that there's not a huge audience

26:26.207 --> 26:28.178
for a movie about jazz poetry.

26:33.381 --> 26:35.284
Aren't you curious where I was?

26:36.686 --> 26:37.687
I know where you were.

26:39.021 --> 26:40.023
How?

26:41.157 --> 26:42.258
It's where you always go.

26:43.391 --> 26:44.393
Hmm.

26:45.794 --> 26:46.996
And I tracked your phone.

26:47.028 --> 26:48.997
Ah.

26:49.031 --> 26:50.767
I just want to make sure
you were safe.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.068
I know.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.376
I'm sorry about all this.
It's just...

27:04.179 --> 27:06.215
Feel like things
are slipping away, you know.

27:06.247 --> 27:07.683
I want to finish this film,

27:07.717 --> 27:09.217
but all I can think about is...

27:09.251 --> 27:10.820
the film I actually wanna do,

27:10.852 --> 27:13.023
the thing this film
is supposed to get me to and...

27:14.422 --> 27:16.092
It feels like
it's all falling apart.

27:19.328 --> 27:20.430
Maybe you should just...

27:22.031 --> 27:23.767
do one thing at a time,
you know.

27:24.833 --> 27:27.703
Do your best on this,
and then...

27:27.736 --> 27:29.238
then you can move on
to the next step.

27:31.005 --> 27:32.007
Yeah.

27:34.275 --> 27:36.045
Hey, how was your audition?

27:37.178 --> 27:38.313
I missed it, remember?

27:38.346 --> 27:40.883
Couldn't get someone
to cover my class.

27:50.759 --> 27:51.760
I'm sorry.

27:56.532 --> 27:57.900
What are we gonna do?

27:59.067 --> 28:00.069
About what?

28:01.236 --> 28:03.305
Bills, jobs,

28:04.540 --> 28:05.809
future,

28:06.842 --> 28:08.177
everything.

28:09.410 --> 28:11.447
That's a lot of problems
for me to solve

28:11.479 --> 28:13.783
at midnight after four beers.

28:13.815 --> 28:15.884
For us to solve.

28:15.918 --> 28:17.152
For us to solve.

28:19.220 --> 28:20.323
But...

28:20.355 --> 28:22.190
do you mind if we solve them

28:22.224 --> 28:23.893
after I go to the bathroom?

28:24.560 --> 28:25.962
Four beers.

28:34.269 --> 28:35.270
You okay?

28:37.573 --> 28:38.775
Yeah.

28:39.574 --> 28:40.776
Are we okay?

28:44.213 --> 28:45.215
We will be.

28:48.316 --> 28:49.318
Okay.

28:53.922 --> 28:55.357
Don't forget to lift the seat.

29:00.129 --> 29:01.997
Just clean it up,

29:03.532 --> 29:04.833
for once.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.436
Clean it up.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.348
Madison.

29:20.381 --> 29:22.450
The anesthesia will kick in soon

29:22.484 --> 29:24.053
and then we'll need
to wait a bit

29:24.085 --> 29:26.054
until your cervix
is fully dilated, okay?

29:49.611 --> 29:51.380
Madison,
are you still with us?

29:52.514 --> 29:53.917
Get Claire. Let's get started.

30:30.619 --> 30:32.121
Hey honey, I'm here.

30:36.025 --> 30:37.060
Hey.

30:43.431 --> 30:44.499
Are you okay?

30:51.439 --> 30:52.909
No, no.

30:54.543 --> 30:55.544
No.

31:22.971 --> 31:24.039
Hey.

31:27.242 --> 31:29.578
I was gonna clean up a bit.

31:29.611 --> 31:32.081
Didn't know where you wanted
to put all of this stuff.

31:37.018 --> 31:39.054
Do you know where
you want me to put all this?

31:52.266 --> 31:54.035
I'm uh...

31:54.069 --> 31:55.471
I'm gonna head out
for a bit, so.

31:55.504 --> 31:57.540
Head out, where?

31:57.573 --> 31:59.574
Just scout some locations
for the work thing.

32:01.476 --> 32:02.477
Today?

32:03.211 --> 32:04.479
Yeah.

32:04.513 --> 32:05.648
Do you have to?

32:06.715 --> 32:08.150
We talked about this.

32:08.182 --> 32:10.585
I got some appointments
at some places

32:13.054 --> 32:14.690
and I can't really
cancel on them again.

32:21.263 --> 32:22.732
You know,

32:22.765 --> 32:25.668
it'll just be a few months
till we can start trying again.

32:26.802 --> 32:28.004
Maybe.

32:29.371 --> 32:30.439
Don't you want to?

32:32.306 --> 32:33.508
Yeah.

32:33.542 --> 32:35.378
Maybe not right away.

32:42.150 --> 32:43.719
Are you gonna go
to your audition today?

32:47.622 --> 32:48.623
I don't know.

32:50.324 --> 32:52.527
Noah,

32:52.561 --> 32:55.264
I'm gonna take a break
from auditions for a while.

32:56.465 --> 32:57.533
A break?

32:59.435 --> 33:00.570
For how long?

33:02.371 --> 33:03.438
I don't know.

33:10.845 --> 33:12.680
Do you think we were gonna have

33:12.714 --> 33:14.417
a girl or a boy?

33:16.584 --> 33:18.386
Too early to tell,
wasn't it?

33:18.419 --> 33:19.621
What do you think?

33:21.489 --> 33:22.525
I don't know.

33:25.660 --> 33:27.596
I think
we were gonna have a girl.

33:30.599 --> 33:31.601
Okay.

33:35.403 --> 33:36.605
Do you like the name,

33:37.538 --> 33:38.640
Molly?

33:40.609 --> 33:41.644
Yeah.

33:41.677 --> 33:43.678
Yeah. Molly is a nice name,
I guess.

33:46.448 --> 33:48.684
I wanted to name
our girl, Molly.

33:52.653 --> 33:53.655
Okay.

33:55.256 --> 33:56.426
So you like that name?

33:57.426 --> 33:58.428
Yeah.

34:00.661 --> 34:02.265
'Cause she's not just mine,

34:03.698 --> 34:04.766
she's ours.

34:07.236 --> 34:09.505
I need to know
that you like that name.

34:11.572 --> 34:12.607
I do.

34:21.215 --> 34:23.217
Noah, I'm, uh,

34:23.251 --> 34:25.487
I'm gonna need to focus
on Molly for a while

34:25.521 --> 34:28.389
before I can think
about trying again.

34:30.190 --> 34:31.193
Okay?

34:33.195 --> 34:34.295
Okay.

34:40.601 --> 34:41.603
All right, well...

34:43.405 --> 34:44.540
I'm gonna head out, but...

34:45.907 --> 34:47.708
I'll make it
as quick as possible.

34:49.844 --> 34:50.880
I promise.

35:32.454 --> 35:33.689
No.

35:35.691 --> 35:36.759
Uh-huh.

35:36.791 --> 35:37.927
That is you.

35:40.829 --> 35:41.863
Maddie.

35:43.264 --> 35:46.368
Oh, isn't that
just perfect for you?

35:47.401 --> 35:48.403
How much is it?

35:51.006 --> 35:53.309
Oh, come on. We can afford it.

35:53.342 --> 35:55.577
Mr. full-time videographer.

35:56.177 --> 35:58.313
Oh, it's my favorite term.

35:58.347 --> 36:00.448
Okay. I know you hate it, but...

36:00.481 --> 36:02.517
Marketing is still
telling stories.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.452
Just itty-bitty short ones.

36:04.485 --> 36:06.688
At least it means I can keep you
in fancy T shirts.

36:06.722 --> 36:08.224
Oh, my prince.

36:09.957 --> 36:11.593
I don't know.
I mean, these I can afford,

36:11.626 --> 36:12.894
but I'll buy you just one more.

36:42.923 --> 36:44.492
Are you okay?

36:45.894 --> 36:47.496
I'm fine.

36:47.528 --> 36:48.597
Are you sure?

36:49.865 --> 36:51.934
Uh, yeah, yes.

36:51.967 --> 36:53.535
Is there anything
I can do?

36:54.068 --> 36:55.537
No, thank you.

37:07.581 --> 37:09.751
Hey, you okay?

37:09.785 --> 37:12.053
- I'm fine. Let's just go.
- Wait.

37:12.086 --> 37:13.855
- What happened?
- Nothing.

37:13.889 --> 37:15.423
I-I just want to go home.

37:16.023 --> 37:18.660
Maddie, what's wrong?

37:19.860 --> 37:21.362
What's wrong with you?

37:21.396 --> 37:23.532
Why does this stuff
never bother you?

37:23.564 --> 37:24.800
Why does what never bother me?

37:24.832 --> 37:26.901
- The baby.
- Oh.

37:27.936 --> 37:30.372
It's like you don't care at all.

37:30.405 --> 37:31.939
Of course, I care.

37:31.972 --> 37:33.608
All right? It's just different
than you do.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.477
Just not as much as I do.

37:35.510 --> 37:36.812
That's not fair.

37:36.845 --> 37:38.781
This is different for men
and for women.

37:38.814 --> 37:40.449
Okay. You had it inside of you.

37:40.481 --> 37:41.483
Her.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.320
You had her inside of you.

37:44.352 --> 37:45.954
For me,

37:45.986 --> 37:48.356
she wasn't even real yet.

37:49.390 --> 37:51.427
Where'd you read that, WebMD?

37:51.459 --> 37:52.860
I'm just trying to understand.

37:52.894 --> 37:54.063
I'm trying to understand

37:54.095 --> 37:55.930
why you haven't touched me
in four months.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.506
I was waiting for you
to tell me when you were ready.

38:05.539 --> 38:07.543
Maybe I need you
to reach out to me.

38:07.575 --> 38:09.043
I can't read your mind, Madison.

38:09.077 --> 38:10.845
I don't know what you want
or what you...

38:14.148 --> 38:15.351
Maddie.

38:23.392 --> 38:24.893
Maddie, talk to me.

38:24.925 --> 38:26.461
Unlock the car, please.

38:40.941 --> 38:43.512
Do you think
I don't wanna be with you or...

38:43.544 --> 38:45.046
Turn the AC on, it's hot.

38:52.052 --> 38:53.355
Do you?

38:55.090 --> 38:56.559
Of course, I do.

38:57.892 --> 38:58.994
Why wouldn't I?

39:00.762 --> 39:02.731
I don't know. I mean,

39:02.764 --> 39:04.767
people change
after stuff like this.

39:06.468 --> 39:07.536
Guys change.

39:09.438 --> 39:13.642
You look at me
like I'm some fragile flower.

39:13.675 --> 39:15.611
It's only because
I want to take care of you.

39:18.546 --> 39:19.747
I don't know how.

39:19.780 --> 39:23.052
You have to stop
thinking of me like that.

39:26.121 --> 39:26.988
We have to go back

39:27.021 --> 39:29.758
to the way things
were before, before...

39:31.159 --> 39:32.561
Molly.

39:34.463 --> 39:35.497
I'm just Maddie

39:35.530 --> 39:37.733
and you're just Noah and...

39:38.967 --> 39:41.102
I don't know.
You know, maybe that's...

39:42.204 --> 39:43.706
all we'll ever be.

39:45.139 --> 39:47.008
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

39:47.809 --> 39:49.611
I don't know when

39:49.644 --> 39:52.548
or if I'll get
through this and...

39:55.150 --> 39:57.186
I need you to be okay with that.

39:59.988 --> 40:01.123
Okay.

40:01.155 --> 40:02.791
I need you to be okay with me

40:02.823 --> 40:04.793
being in a bad place
emotionally.

40:04.825 --> 40:06.896
You can't always fix my moods.

40:08.997 --> 40:10.466
Okay.

40:10.499 --> 40:12.134
And I need you to...

40:13.735 --> 40:15.838
want to make love to me.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.106
Even if I'm not over this yet.

40:19.573 --> 40:20.575
I do.

40:21.610 --> 40:23.711
I might not want to sometimes.

40:23.744 --> 40:25.713
I might say, "No,
not now. I can't."

40:27.648 --> 40:28.650
Yeah.

40:29.284 --> 40:30.519
I can do that.

40:31.952 --> 40:32.987
You can?

40:34.555 --> 40:35.590
Are you sure?

40:37.659 --> 40:39.126
Uh, I can try.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.629
Don't try.

40:41.829 --> 40:43.532
Just be sure.

40:43.564 --> 40:46.068
I need you to be sure.

40:47.635 --> 40:48.736
Okay.

40:50.639 --> 40:52.707
- Okay?
- Okay.

40:56.144 --> 40:57.145
Then take me home

40:57.178 --> 40:59.615
'cause I need you
to make love to me right now.

41:03.184 --> 41:04.253
Don't you want to?

41:04.285 --> 41:06.787
Yeah, yeah.

41:06.820 --> 41:07.956
Then let's go.

41:09.323 --> 41:10.592
Let's go.

41:33.014 --> 41:35.784
And then you ran into the room
with a balloon on your face.

41:35.816 --> 41:39.655
I said, "Give me all the money
or the balloon gets it."

41:40.956 --> 41:42.758
I can't believe
you didn't get arrested.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.959
- I actually did.
- What?

41:44.992 --> 41:47.862
Yeah, I did.
I just never told anybody.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.264
Why not? I would
have bailed you out.

41:49.296 --> 41:51.032
It just made it really clear

41:51.066 --> 41:54.002
that a Black male, 20 something,

41:54.035 --> 41:57.973
should never,
never pretend to rob anyone.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.110
Well, I need another drink.

42:02.142 --> 42:04.211
- Grab you another?
- Uh, I'm good, man.

42:04.244 --> 42:06.781
Nonsense. After that story,

42:06.814 --> 42:09.017
we need to get drunk.

42:10.184 --> 42:11.619
- Oh, my God.
- What?

42:11.653 --> 42:12.688
Carol Stone.

42:14.322 --> 42:17.325
Well, I was kind of hoping
she wouldn't make it.

42:17.358 --> 42:18.860
You didn't want to see your ex?

42:20.095 --> 42:21.196
It's not a big deal.

42:22.664 --> 42:25.734
Wow. She has aged
quite gracefully indeed.

42:25.767 --> 42:27.303
Yeah, she looks good.

42:29.204 --> 42:30.872
This isn't gonna be
a problem, is it?

42:32.240 --> 42:35.644
Man, I'm a, I'm a married man
now, all right?

42:35.677 --> 42:37.678
She is ancient history.

42:37.711 --> 42:40.148
Really. You, my friend,
are as magnanimous as ever.

42:40.180 --> 42:42.249
- Magnanimous.
- Monogamous.

42:42.282 --> 42:44.586
Whatever. See?
College education worked.

42:45.919 --> 42:46.921
Yeah.

42:48.088 --> 42:49.357
Shit. I lost her.

42:50.791 --> 42:52.126
- Hi, guys.
- Whoa! Hey.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.329
Hi.

42:54.361 --> 42:56.164
Nice to see you too, Gabe.

42:56.197 --> 42:58.834
Carol Stone,
as I live and breathe.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.369
- Hi. Um...
- Hi, Gabe.

43:01.802 --> 43:03.070
Noah.

43:03.104 --> 43:04.239
How've you been?

43:05.939 --> 43:07.809
Great, great.

43:07.842 --> 43:09.044
I'm good too.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.915
I'm going to go
get us some drinks.

43:13.947 --> 43:15.249
Hey.

43:15.282 --> 43:17.051
- Won't you let me do that?
- No, no.

43:17.084 --> 43:18.753
No, you're great. I'm...

43:18.787 --> 43:19.888
Be right back.

43:29.396 --> 43:32.767
Is that Maddog Madison?

43:32.800 --> 43:34.035
Luke.

43:35.403 --> 43:36.839
Hi.

43:40.775 --> 43:43.278
- Everything okay?
- I, uh, yes.

43:46.414 --> 43:49.184
Wow, this is embarrassing.

43:50.017 --> 43:51.352
What?

43:51.385 --> 43:52.987
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.

43:54.088 --> 43:55.690
I knew you'd probably be here.

43:55.724 --> 43:59.093
I just didn't know how I'd feel

43:59.126 --> 44:00.428
when we saw each other.

44:02.896 --> 44:04.132
How do you feel?

44:07.334 --> 44:08.836
Do I have to answer that?

44:12.039 --> 44:15.476
Hey, uh, at least
join me for a drink.

44:15.510 --> 44:17.146
Then you can decide
how you feel.

44:33.827 --> 44:37.032
So, I see you're still married.

44:38.432 --> 44:40.268
Yeah. Still married.

44:40.934 --> 44:41.936
Any kids?

44:43.037 --> 44:45.140
No.

44:45.173 --> 44:47.275
I can't believe you got to meet
with the Prime Minister.

44:47.307 --> 44:49.510
That is so cool.

44:49.543 --> 44:51.212
It wasn't that big a deal.

44:51.246 --> 44:53.347
It's not like I had an audience
with the Queen.

44:53.381 --> 44:54.783
True.

44:54.816 --> 44:56.452
Why am I even talking to you?

45:02.791 --> 45:04.793
You know, I'm glad
we're both here tonight.

45:04.825 --> 45:06.827
Why is that?

45:06.860 --> 45:09.196
Because it gives me the chance
to say something to you

45:09.229 --> 45:12.066
that I have wanted to say
for a long time.

45:12.867 --> 45:13.901
I'm sorry.

45:14.968 --> 45:16.003
For what?

45:17.805 --> 45:20.374
I was a terrible boyfriend.

45:20.407 --> 45:21.843
Oh, Luke.

45:22.543 --> 45:24.345
Whatever. It's in the past.

45:24.378 --> 45:26.214
No, no.

45:28.316 --> 45:30.318
I look back on the way
I behaved in college

45:30.351 --> 45:31.887
and not just to you.

45:32.887 --> 45:34.523
God, I just cringe.

45:36.990 --> 45:40.294
So I'm hoping that
you will accept my apology.

45:42.363 --> 45:43.432
Yeah, of course.

45:44.566 --> 45:45.768
Maddie,

45:46.601 --> 45:47.936
I mean it.

45:49.403 --> 45:52.340
I just wish
you had said that years ago.

45:55.142 --> 45:56.144
You do?

45:57.412 --> 46:01.249
No, I mean, not that I didn't...

46:01.282 --> 46:04.852
Uh, that came out not what I...

46:04.885 --> 46:06.854
how I meant it. Sorry.

46:06.887 --> 46:09.557
I just always thought

46:09.590 --> 46:12.026
you and I might end up together.

46:12.059 --> 46:13.928
I thought we had more in common.

46:13.961 --> 46:15.530
Like what?

46:17.064 --> 46:18.967
I don't know.

46:18.999 --> 46:21.003
Life experience.

46:22.403 --> 46:24.206
Anyway, I interrupted you.

46:26.474 --> 46:28.176
Not much since then.

46:28.209 --> 46:30.477
I've been working
at the university for a while,

46:30.510 --> 46:33.881
marketing department,
making videos.

46:33.914 --> 46:36.250
Not exactly the type of work
I set out to do.

46:37.184 --> 46:39.486
Still trying to get
funds together, to...

46:39.519 --> 46:41.255
start this film
that I've been working on.

46:41.289 --> 46:42.557
Oh, what's it about?

46:42.590 --> 46:45.160
Used to be about
Langston Hughes,

46:45.193 --> 46:49.164
- Mm.
- but it sort of evolved.

46:49.197 --> 46:50.932
And now I found myself
more interested

46:50.965 --> 46:53.133
in writing about
the types of people

46:53.166 --> 46:55.469
and situations
that he wrote about.

46:57.037 --> 46:59.073
Anyway, somewhere in there,

46:59.106 --> 47:00.575
ten years passed and...

47:04.111 --> 47:05.180
Ten years.

47:07.447 --> 47:09.116
Madison and I, we've...

47:10.651 --> 47:13.588
we've been through
some stuff together.

47:13.621 --> 47:17.392
Hasn't always been easy,
but we're still standing.

47:22.262 --> 47:23.430
You?

47:23.463 --> 47:26.200
Honestly, I should have known
better from the beginning.

47:26.934 --> 47:28.068
What do you mean?

47:28.102 --> 47:32.107
I mean, we met
in a dive bar downtown.

47:32.139 --> 47:34.375
It's not how great romances
begin, you know.

47:34.409 --> 47:36.378
I don't know, stranger things
have happened.

47:36.410 --> 47:39.347
Yeah, but not likely.

47:39.380 --> 47:43.684
For example, you guys have been
together for ten years.

47:43.718 --> 47:46.988
I bet you have a great story
about how you met, right?

47:47.021 --> 47:48.923
Don't know if it's
a great story...

47:48.956 --> 47:50.391
I mean, it's a story.

47:51.224 --> 47:53.227
Tell me. Come on.

47:54.294 --> 47:58.166
So, uh, you guys are doing good?

47:58.198 --> 47:59.635
Yeah, yeah, we're, we're good.

48:02.637 --> 48:05.140
Do I detect a little doubt?

48:05.173 --> 48:08.310
We had a little fight
on the way over here.

48:08.843 --> 48:09.711
We were running late

48:09.744 --> 48:11.713
because I wasn't finished
getting ready.

48:11.746 --> 48:13.581
Being late drives him crazy.

48:14.581 --> 48:17.084
Seems like a pretty minor thing.

48:17.117 --> 48:19.486
Certainly does to me.

48:19.519 --> 48:22.489
So you met him
after you broke up with me

48:22.523 --> 48:23.791
because I was such an asshole.

48:23.825 --> 48:27.162
Noah was one of my best friends
the whole time we were dating.

48:27.195 --> 48:29.597
You met him
before we were dating

48:30.631 --> 48:31.499
or during?

48:31.532 --> 48:33.735
I would have to tell you
the whole story

48:33.767 --> 48:36.137
and I know
you don't want to hear that.

48:36.169 --> 48:38.506
No, no, I'm curious.

48:40.140 --> 48:42.010
Annie, my younger sister

48:42.043 --> 48:44.412
told me that she knew this guy

48:44.445 --> 48:46.613
that was a freshman, uh,

48:46.646 --> 48:49.683
that I should meet him,
that he was funny and nice.

48:49.717 --> 48:50.584
I was a lonely freshman

48:50.617 --> 48:52.453
so I was all about
making new friends.

48:52.486 --> 48:55.090
But we'd just never seemed
to cross paths.

48:55.122 --> 48:57.758
Until one day, I had to go
to the Dean's office

48:57.791 --> 49:00.027
'cause I missed
too many arts events.

49:00.061 --> 49:01.496
You remember that requirement
where we had to see

49:01.528 --> 49:03.530
so many plays
or musical events or whatever.

49:03.564 --> 49:06.501
A requirement I was not paying
attention to, whatsoever.

49:06.534 --> 49:08.135
And...

49:08.168 --> 49:09.470
- There she was.
- There he was.

49:10.738 --> 49:12.107
I figured out who he was

49:12.139 --> 49:15.042
because Annie
had described him to me.

49:15.075 --> 49:18.112
I wasn't expecting her
to be so, so pretty

49:18.146 --> 49:20.715
or so down to earth.

49:20.747 --> 49:23.184
So you fell for her
right then and there?

49:24.552 --> 49:27.122
No, not at all.

49:27.155 --> 49:30.225
We just kind of clicked
and became really good friends.

49:30.258 --> 49:32.694
I loved spending time with him.

49:32.727 --> 49:34.029
We had a blast,

49:34.061 --> 49:36.163
we did everything together.

49:36.731 --> 49:38.499
He was so passionate.

49:38.532 --> 49:43.137
He, he believed art
could change the world.

49:43.171 --> 49:44.473
When she danced...

49:47.108 --> 49:48.476
it inspired me.

49:48.508 --> 49:52.481
But I didn't see him
as boyfriend material at all.

49:53.247 --> 49:54.783
Why not?

49:54.816 --> 49:56.751
I don't know. You know how it is

49:56.784 --> 49:59.186
when you're attracted
to someone.

49:59.220 --> 50:01.723
With Noah, he was my friend.

50:01.756 --> 50:03.358
And whatever that thing was

50:03.390 --> 50:06.126
that had to click for me
to be attracted to him

50:06.160 --> 50:08.630
just hadn't clicked.

50:08.662 --> 50:11.832
Every time I thought about doing
something, I would call her.

50:11.865 --> 50:14.503
We really were best friends,
but...

50:16.236 --> 50:18.405
something started to change.

50:18.439 --> 50:22.244
It became clear to me that he
wanted more than a friendship.

50:23.644 --> 50:25.380
She was just not interested.

50:28.381 --> 50:33.822
And I did a lot of cheesy stuff
to try to convince her.

50:33.854 --> 50:37.092
He left notes in my car,
for example.

50:37.124 --> 50:39.226
This one time,
I borrowed her car

50:39.260 --> 50:40.595
and I left the CD player queued,

50:40.628 --> 50:42.363
so that when she turned
the car on,

50:42.396 --> 50:44.332
that particular song would play.

50:44.365 --> 50:47.102
And I'm listening
to this song play...

50:47.135 --> 50:50.537
I mean, there's this entire
song about not being able to let go.

50:50.570 --> 50:55.342
And I'm thinking,
"This is going to be a problem."

50:55.376 --> 50:57.812
I mean, I told myself,
"I'll get over it."

50:57.845 --> 50:59.581
"She's my best friend
and I'll get over it."

51:00.648 --> 51:03.151
But he couldn't.

51:03.184 --> 51:06.187
I felt like I was hurting him
being around him.

51:06.220 --> 51:08.457
And just like that,
we stopped hanging out altogether.

51:09.423 --> 51:10.425
I cut it off.

51:15.762 --> 51:20.200
A year and a half goes by
and I finally got over her.

51:20.233 --> 51:22.669
And I started seeing you,
focused more on school

51:22.702 --> 51:26.273
and I just moved on.

51:26.307 --> 51:29.511
And, one night, I'm having some
friends over to watch a movie

51:29.543 --> 51:32.146
and he was with them.

51:32.180 --> 51:35.817
By this point, we hadn't
spoken in probably over a year.

51:35.849 --> 51:40.421
So, yeah, kinda awkward,
you know, but...

51:42.423 --> 51:43.825
We talked the entire night.

51:45.226 --> 51:46.461
I don't remember
what we talked about.

51:46.494 --> 51:50.164
Just caught up on
what we missed, I guess.

51:52.265 --> 51:57.872
I remember new feelings
swirling around.

51:59.874 --> 52:02.577
I didn't know
what I was feeling, really.

52:02.610 --> 52:04.711
But, now I'm just
thinking to myself,

52:04.744 --> 52:07.948
"Do not get feelings
for her, again. Just don't."

52:07.981 --> 52:10.351
But I could tell
it was happening.

52:11.086 --> 52:13.254
And I wake up
later in the day

52:13.287 --> 52:16.691
and I'm going over this in my mind.
I'm thinking, I'm like,

52:16.724 --> 52:19.727
"I'm pretty sure she was
giving me some signals."

52:19.760 --> 52:23.631
But after everything that has
happened, I do not trust myself.

52:23.664 --> 52:27.602
The phone rings and it's him.

52:27.635 --> 52:30.972
And he asked me if I want
to get a bite to eat sometime.

52:31.005 --> 52:32.573
Dinner and a movie, maybe.

52:33.441 --> 52:35.944
I said, "Yeah, sure."

52:35.977 --> 52:37.979
And he says,
"Just to be clear..."

52:38.012 --> 52:41.849
"I'm kind of thinking
of this as, an actual date."

52:41.881 --> 52:43.584
Me too.

52:43.617 --> 52:45.719
We went out that weekend and...

52:45.753 --> 52:49.957
And I fell in love with him
within a few weeks.

52:49.990 --> 52:52.626
We got engaged
a couple of months later.

52:52.660 --> 52:55.697
And we've been
together ever since.

52:55.729 --> 52:59.200
Through good times and bad.

52:59.867 --> 53:01.769
See, I told you.

53:02.702 --> 53:03.737
What?

53:03.771 --> 53:05.539
Great couples
have great stories.

53:09.010 --> 53:11.613
Through good times and bad?

53:11.646 --> 53:14.216
Well, every marriage
has its ups and downs.

53:21.021 --> 53:22.823
It is nice seeing you, Luke.

53:24.392 --> 53:26.261
I'm gonna
find my husband now.

53:32.566 --> 53:35.270
So, can I get one dance
before the night is over?

53:37.505 --> 53:39.608
It was really
nice to see you, Carol.

53:43.711 --> 53:44.879
I got to go find my wife.

53:47.615 --> 53:48.617
Take care.

53:57.557 --> 53:59.660
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

54:00.927 --> 54:02.729
Wanna dance?

54:02.762 --> 54:05.032
Thought you'd never ask.

54:09.669 --> 54:10.671
Is that your ex?

54:11.639 --> 54:13.742
- Yeah. It is.
- Hmm.

54:15.543 --> 54:16.845
And where have you been?

54:17.477 --> 54:20.014
My ex is here too, actually.

54:20.046 --> 54:22.382
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

54:22.416 --> 54:23.450
You know,

54:23.483 --> 54:25.619
I think
she wanted me to ditch you.

54:25.653 --> 54:26.655
Oh!

54:27.588 --> 54:28.622
What did you say?

54:30.657 --> 54:32.559
I told her
I was a married man.

54:45.905 --> 54:48.842
So what the short is ultimately
about is these three generations.

54:48.876 --> 54:51.778
Grandfather, father and son,
passing on the tailgate tradition

54:51.811 --> 54:53.847
from generation
to generation,

54:53.881 --> 54:55.583
through winning
and losing seasons.

54:55.615 --> 54:57.117
It's about being a fan,

54:57.151 --> 54:59.688
and it's about bonding
with family through sports.

55:03.691 --> 55:05.959
How will this help me
sell hamburger buns?

55:05.992 --> 55:08.829
Well, I'm not trying to sell...

55:13.032 --> 55:15.402
I'm not just trying
to sell hamburger buns.

55:15.436 --> 55:17.905
I'm trying to tell the story
of your brand

55:17.938 --> 55:21.709
to connect your brand to the way
people think about family and sports.

55:21.742 --> 55:23.845
When they associate
those two things,

55:23.878 --> 55:26.447
they will see your brand
as an integral part

55:26.479 --> 55:28.448
of the tailgate tradition,

55:28.481 --> 55:30.684
and that will
sell hamburger buns.

55:32.787 --> 55:34.655
I don't get it.

55:34.688 --> 55:37.624
Could they bond over a
shared love of hamburger buns?

55:39.559 --> 55:42.662
Well, of course, we'll end on the
classic, 'Bite and Smile'.

55:42.695 --> 55:44.464
With a big close-up
on the bun,

55:44.497 --> 55:45.766
around the juicy burger.

55:46.934 --> 55:48.136
Why didn't you just say so?

55:58.611 --> 56:00.782
Hey, David,

56:00.814 --> 56:02.650
I know I'm new here
and everything,

56:02.682 --> 56:05.119
- but, what the hell was that?
- Mm?

56:05.151 --> 56:08.423
I thought you and I, we were on the
same page with this entire pitch.

56:08.456 --> 56:12.827
Calm down. Look, they were not
tracking with that idea at all.

56:12.860 --> 56:14.796
Just trying to keep it
from going further south.

56:14.829 --> 56:17.497
But the cheesy,
'Bite and Smile.' Really?

56:17.530 --> 56:19.800
That is literally every
commercial they've ever done.

56:19.834 --> 56:22.003
I'm trying to give 'em
something new. Okay.

56:22.035 --> 56:23.570
People would have
remembered that spot.

56:23.604 --> 56:27.008
They would have cried remembering
tailgates they had with their grandfathers.

56:27.041 --> 56:31.144
Okay, well, I just don't think they're
ready for this kind of campaign.

56:31.177 --> 56:33.447
Some brands are just
more conservative.

56:33.481 --> 56:34.916
Well, maybe they'd
have gone for it,

56:34.948 --> 56:36.751
if you would have
backed it up a little.

56:36.784 --> 56:38.885
It's one 'Bite and Smile.'

56:38.918 --> 56:40.687
If they let you do
the whole thing,

56:40.720 --> 56:42.023
you just add that at the end.

56:42.055 --> 56:45.159
- What's the big deal?
- Then it's not a story.

56:45.191 --> 56:48.662
It's just another
hamburger bun commercial.

56:48.695 --> 56:50.964
They're paying us for another
hamburger bun commercial.

56:59.974 --> 57:03.577
Forehead five, six, seven, eight.

57:03.610 --> 57:06.213
And one, two, three, four,

57:06.247 --> 57:09.584
<i>plie,</i> six, seven, eight.

57:15.122 --> 57:17.692
Slide, and...

57:18.425 --> 57:21.528
<i>Rond de jambe, Rond de jambe,</i>

57:21.561 --> 57:24.164
classic, arabesque.

57:33.907 --> 57:35.842
Nice.
It's looking really good, ladies.

57:35.876 --> 57:39.146
Um, some of us need a little
more practice than others,

57:39.178 --> 57:41.282
but just make sure we're
working on it over the weekend.

57:41.314 --> 57:42.583
Yeah?

58:10.276 --> 58:12.546
Ava not doing well?

58:12.579 --> 58:15.315
Oh, yeah. She's not picking it
up as fast as the other girls,

58:15.349 --> 58:16.816
but she'll be fine.

58:16.849 --> 58:18.052
She just needs
a little confidence.

58:18.084 --> 58:19.787
I'm not worried.

58:20.787 --> 58:24.124
You know, every girl
who starts teaching here,

58:24.157 --> 58:27.193
wants to be
or wanted to be a dancer.

58:27.227 --> 58:29.096
I saw that in you too.

58:29.128 --> 58:31.898
You know, the kids
were just a distraction.

58:31.932 --> 58:35.269
You have a look of someone
who had settled for this job.

58:35.302 --> 58:36.671
Oh, I'm sorry...

58:36.704 --> 58:38.238
It's okay.

58:38.271 --> 58:42.976
It's okay. Everyone here
has settled to some extent.

58:44.177 --> 58:46.313
But,

58:46.347 --> 58:50.117
I've been watching you this
year really take to the girls.

58:50.150 --> 58:52.919
Really encourage them,
mentor them,

58:52.952 --> 58:57.023
and teach them about
this beautiful art form.

58:57.057 --> 59:01.662
You've helped them build their
self esteem until it spills out

59:01.695 --> 59:04.899
into every other aspect of their lives.

59:04.932 --> 59:07.301
When I see you
with girls like Ava,

59:07.334 --> 59:10.004
I can see that you understand,

59:10.037 --> 59:14.241
that dance is not just about
being a good dancer.

59:14.273 --> 59:17.611
It's about expressing yourself,
regardless of who's watching.

59:20.713 --> 59:23.717
I... I don't know
how else to say this?

59:23.751 --> 59:25.285
Um...

59:25.318 --> 59:27.153
I'm announcing my retirement

59:27.186 --> 59:29.222
at our last
recital performance this year.

59:30.823 --> 59:32.026
What?

59:32.059 --> 59:36.162
And because I've seen
all of this and you,

59:36.195 --> 59:38.098
I want you to take over
the studio.

59:39.298 --> 59:40.968
I want to sell it to you.

59:43.037 --> 59:44.405
Wh...

59:44.439 --> 59:47.207
Well, you're the only person that I trust

59:47.240 --> 59:50.878
to do the things that
I've always done here.

59:50.910 --> 59:52.380
And I won't charge you much.

59:52.412 --> 59:55.048
You can make payments
with the monthly profits.

59:56.383 --> 59:58.151
I don't care
about the money.

59:59.086 --> 01:00:02.290
What I mostly care about
is you running it.

01:00:05.124 --> 01:00:06.193
Um...

01:00:08.128 --> 01:00:12.867
- Noah just took that job in Texas.
- I know.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:18.238
And I also know that you're not
so sure about this whole move.

01:00:18.271 --> 01:00:22.677
Dear, you have to decide
what is right for you.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.713
If this school
is right for you.

01:00:28.981 --> 01:00:30.317
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:00:50.403 --> 01:00:51.738
<i>Hey, man.
How did the pitch go?</i>

01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:54.340
- Double vodka.<i>
- That good, huh?</i>

01:00:54.374 --> 01:00:57.912
Yet another great idea that
will never see the light of day.

01:00:58.479 --> 01:00:59.914
<i>Well, speaking of...</i>

01:01:00.947 --> 01:01:02.048
What?

01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:03.717
<i>There's been some interest.</i>

01:01:03.751 --> 01:01:05.019
In what?

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:06.287
<i>In what? Come on!</i>

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.722
<i>The Langston Hughes script.</i>

01:01:08.354 --> 01:01:09.322
What kind of interest?

01:01:09.356 --> 01:01:11.358
<i>Well, don't get your hopes up
too high,</i>

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.360
<i>but a producer with
a first-look deal,</i>

01:01:13.392 --> 01:01:15.262
<i>with a very small
production company.</i>

01:01:15.294 --> 01:01:17.497
<i>But he's interested
and wants to read it.</i>

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:19.400
He hasn't even read it?

01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:21.902
<i>Man, this is good.
It's a start.</i>

01:01:23.003 --> 01:01:24.338
Yeah, you're right.

01:01:24.371 --> 01:01:27.775
Uh, hey, here's to getting
our hopes up.

01:01:28.407 --> 01:01:29.409
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:01:30.443 --> 01:01:31.813
<i>Just you wait.</i>

01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:35.549
<i>Where were we?</i>

01:01:35.581 --> 01:01:39.753
- Here's to getting our hopes up.<i>
- But not too high.</i>

01:01:39.787 --> 01:01:42.457
Here's to getting our hopes up
to just the right height.

01:01:49.329 --> 01:01:50.497
So, Noah.

01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:53.767
You wanna talk about
why you're here?

01:01:56.235 --> 01:01:57.304
I don't know.

01:01:58.539 --> 01:01:59.874
My wife wants me here.

01:02:01.275 --> 01:02:03.443
I feel like things are fine.

01:02:03.477 --> 01:02:06.414
I have a decent job,
even if it's not what I want to be doing.

01:02:07.981 --> 01:02:10.151
I might, one day, maybe,

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:13.019
get to make this film that I've
been working on for a long time.

01:02:16.423 --> 01:02:17.992
I don't know.
She hasn't even moved here yet.

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:20.061
So, maybe we should ask her?

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.496
Oh.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:25.398
Why do you think
she wants you here?

01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:28.401
She says she wants me to
understand the source of my anger.

01:02:29.836 --> 01:02:31.905
Because she says
that I get angry

01:02:31.939 --> 01:02:33.507
and then I take it out on her.

01:02:33.539 --> 01:02:36.309
What do you mean
when you say, "I get angry?"

01:02:39.546 --> 01:02:41.381
I don't know.
I get angry about...

01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:44.952
Little stuff.

01:02:44.985 --> 01:02:46.187
Like what?

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.322
Like work.

01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:53.361
How my ideas are constantly
looked over and...

01:02:56.997 --> 01:02:57.999
Oh, it's just a job.

01:02:59.932 --> 01:03:02.068
It's not my passion,
so I guess it doesn't matter.

01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:04.304
What else?

01:03:04.338 --> 01:03:06.439
- Is work all that bothers you?
- No.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.144
Other things
bother me too, like,

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:13.514
the way people drive, how Madison
never picks up around the house.

01:03:18.651 --> 01:03:22.956
Yeah. Yes, I know how petty
and stupid that sounds.

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:26.259
Why do you think these things
make you angry?

01:03:29.997 --> 01:03:32.033
Is this ever successful?

01:03:32.932 --> 01:03:34.434
When someone goes to therapy

01:03:34.468 --> 01:03:37.371
because their spouse
effectively forces them to.

01:03:37.403 --> 01:03:39.505
What do you mean,
forces you to?

01:03:39.539 --> 01:03:41.342
It feels like
emotional blackmail.

01:03:42.575 --> 01:03:45.378
Like, if I don't come here,
she'll leave me.

01:03:45.412 --> 01:03:48.249
- She said that you?
- It's just a feeling.

01:03:53.019 --> 01:03:54.420
You never
answered my question.

01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:56.490
Oh, I'm sorry.
Which question?

01:03:56.523 --> 01:03:58.059
Does this ever work?

01:03:58.992 --> 01:04:00.928
It can.

01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:03.030
If you're willing to go beyond

01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:04.465
whatever reasons
that brought you here

01:04:04.497 --> 01:04:07.168
and see if there's work
we can do together.

01:04:09.135 --> 01:04:12.538
For example, what I'm hearing
you say is that

01:04:12.572 --> 01:04:14.407
some of the things
you're angry about

01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:17.244
are likely representing
your frustration

01:04:17.276 --> 01:04:20.380
at not being in control
of some areas of your life.

01:04:20.414 --> 01:04:23.651
In areas like your marriage,
your job.

01:04:25.184 --> 01:04:26.387
Does that ring true?

01:04:30.122 --> 01:04:31.624
Maybe.

01:04:31.657 --> 01:04:34.361
Then why don't we try
to unpack it a little,

01:04:35.428 --> 01:04:36.664
see if I can help?

01:04:37.497 --> 01:04:38.900
Hmm?

01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:40.968
What do you say?

01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:45.439
Yeah, okay.

01:04:53.347 --> 01:04:56.115
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:04:56.148 --> 01:04:57.383
Hey.

01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:59.219
You'll never guess
where I am right now.

01:05:00.454 --> 01:05:02.089
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>
- Okay.

01:05:06.059 --> 01:05:08.162
- <i>I'm not coming.</i>
- You're not coming where?

01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:11.564
<i>There to Texas.
I'm not moving.</i>

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.469
Why?

01:05:16.503 --> 01:05:20.041
<i>Gloria is retiring and she's
selling me the studio.</i>

01:05:21.441 --> 01:05:23.977
<i>I'm gonna stay here
and run the studio full time.</i>

01:05:25.611 --> 01:05:27.247
You're leaving me.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.685
<i>This can't come
as a complete surprise, right?</i>

01:05:33.186 --> 01:05:35.990
You're leaving me
to run a dance studio.

01:05:36.023 --> 01:05:39.559
<i>I'm not leaving you
to run a dance studio.</i>

01:05:39.593 --> 01:05:42.563
<i>I'm leaving you because
you're an unhappy person</i>

01:05:42.595 --> 01:05:45.032
<i>and you're making me
an unhappy person.</i>

01:05:46.099 --> 01:05:48.568
<i>It's not like we haven't had
this conversation</i>

01:05:48.602 --> 01:05:51.605
<i>a hundred times
and it's always the same.</i>

01:05:51.637 --> 01:05:54.207
<i>And now I have to pick up
and change my life</i>

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.177
<i>because you took a job
that you don't even want?</i>

01:05:59.311 --> 01:06:02.348
I need to work, okay.
We need to pay bills.

01:06:02.381 --> 01:06:05.084
So, yes,
I took a job in marketing.

01:06:05.117 --> 01:06:07.186
A job I don't exactly want.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.557
A job you encouraged me to take,
might I remind you.

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:12.425
<i>I encouraged you
to take it because</i>

01:06:12.459 --> 01:06:14.128
<i>I thought it would
make you happy.</i>

01:06:18.798 --> 01:06:20.034
You know, it's, it is...

01:06:20.066 --> 01:06:23.469
It's better than sitting around
and complaining all the time

01:06:23.503 --> 01:06:25.706
about not being able to
do what I want to do.

01:06:25.738 --> 01:06:27.707
<i>I do not complain about that.</i>

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:29.209
I was talking about me.

01:06:31.077 --> 01:06:33.046
<i>No, you're not the person
I married.</i>

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:36.584
Nobody gets this far in life
without changing.

01:06:37.651 --> 01:06:38.752
Okay?

01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:41.022
You've changed too.

01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:44.457
<i>Look, let's not do this
right now.</i>

01:06:44.490 --> 01:06:46.760
<i>We're just gonna fight.
It's not gonna help anything.</i>

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.661
<i>You won't work on this.</i>

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.935
That's not true.

01:06:54.968 --> 01:06:58.172
Okay? I literally just came out
of a therapist's office.

01:07:00.606 --> 01:07:03.076
<i>It's just too late.</i>

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:05.111
<i>Let's talk later
about the details.</i>

01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:07.081
The details?

01:07:07.113 --> 01:07:08.381
<i>The apartment and stuff.</i>

01:07:08.414 --> 01:07:10.450
<i>I might sign a new lease,</i>

01:07:10.483 --> 01:07:13.319
<i>but I don't know
if I can afford it by myself.</i>

01:07:13.352 --> 01:07:14.320
<i>If I move, I'll let you know.</i>

01:07:14.354 --> 01:07:16.622
<i>Is there anything
that you left behind?</i>

01:07:16.655 --> 01:07:18.391
<i>Anything I need to send?</i>

01:07:18.425 --> 01:07:19.794
Yeah, I'm sure there's...

01:07:21.595 --> 01:07:22.630
I don't know.

01:07:22.662 --> 01:07:26.132
<i>If I find anything,
I'll send it over, okay?</i>

01:07:29.903 --> 01:07:31.138
Noah?

01:07:32.372 --> 01:07:37.511
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Madison, please, okay?

01:07:37.543 --> 01:07:40.480
Let's just talk about this, all right?
I'll drive out tonight.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:43.249
- Then we can work on...<i>
- Don't drive down. Please no, don't.</i>

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:46.486
<i>Let's just do it this way,
please.</i>

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.190
<i>It hurts now, Noah.</i>

01:07:50.823 --> 01:07:52.358
<i>It'll hurt for a while.</i>

01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:56.863
<i>And then one day,
you'll realize,</i>

01:07:56.896 --> 01:07:59.132
<i>it's been a few days
since you thought about me.</i>

01:08:00.901 --> 01:08:02.636
<i>And then you'll go
few more days.</i>

01:08:04.704 --> 01:08:09.110
<i>And the days in between will
keep getting longer and longer.</i>

01:08:11.311 --> 01:08:12.746
And how do you know that?

01:08:13.912 --> 01:08:16.783
<i>I've been getting past you
like that for a while now.</i>

01:08:18.718 --> 01:08:20.488
<i>It wasn't easy,
but it happened.</i>

01:08:22.188 --> 01:08:24.323
<i>I didn't realize
it was over until</i>

01:08:24.357 --> 01:08:26.827
<i>Gloria asked me
to take over the studio.</i>

01:08:28.961 --> 01:08:30.863
<i>When she did,
my only hesitation was</i>

01:08:30.897 --> 01:08:32.600
<i>whether or not
I could afford it.</i>

01:08:33.866 --> 01:08:36.202
<i>And I knew
that meant something.</i>

01:08:40.607 --> 01:08:42.709
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.710
<i>Look, don't drive
until you're ready</i>

01:08:44.743 --> 01:08:46.412
<i>to concentrate
on the road, okay?</i>

01:09:18.745 --> 01:09:21.515
Uh, I can, of course, provide
most of these services for you.

01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:24.885
I'll just need whatever
information you want to provide.

01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:27.453
This is the full range
of casket options.

01:09:27.487 --> 01:09:29.923
You'll see both wood
and metal options on there,

01:09:29.955 --> 01:09:32.558
along with a variety
of interior fabrics.

01:09:32.591 --> 01:09:36.229
From a simple crepe to a
more luxurious velvet lining.

01:09:36.263 --> 01:09:38.765
What's the difference
between wood and metal?

01:09:38.798 --> 01:09:41.835
The metal caskets are
more protective.

01:09:41.867 --> 01:09:44.971
Meaning, they're designed to withstand
the entrance of outside elements.

01:09:45.004 --> 01:09:48.774
- Outside elements?
- Like tree roots or burrowing animals.

01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:52.946
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean that anything...

01:09:52.978 --> 01:09:55.816
It's okay. We know you didn't
mean anything by it.

01:09:55.848 --> 01:09:57.316
Why don't you take Mom home

01:09:57.349 --> 01:09:58.885
and I'll finish with
the arrangements here?

01:09:59.919 --> 01:10:01.588
Are you sure?

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:03.923
I'm the oldest. It's my job.

01:10:03.956 --> 01:10:05.491
It's not just your job.

01:10:05.525 --> 01:10:07.460
It can handle it.

01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:09.662
Okay. Come on, Mom.
Let's go home.

01:10:09.696 --> 01:10:12.433
We can let Madison finish the
arrangements and we'll go home and rest.

01:10:17.536 --> 01:10:20.740
I don't want any
tree roots getting in, okay?

01:10:21.607 --> 01:10:22.610
Okay, Mom.

01:10:25.711 --> 01:10:28.014
I'm truly sorry.

01:10:28.048 --> 01:10:31.318
It's fine. Uh, what else
do we have to cover?

01:10:31.351 --> 01:10:33.820
There are a number of
arrangements I can handle for you.

01:10:33.853 --> 01:10:35.756
Uh, the obituary.
You can either write it yourself

01:10:35.789 --> 01:10:39.826
or I have a template here that you
can fill in with relevant details.

01:10:39.858 --> 01:10:42.929
Does your family have a preferred
church or a member of the clergy?

01:10:43.996 --> 01:10:45.365
No.

01:10:45.397 --> 01:10:48.302
We can arrange that, too
if you'd like.

01:10:48.335 --> 01:10:51.471
So that's a yes to arranging
the clergy for the service?

01:10:51.504 --> 01:10:55.843
- Uh, yes.
- Uh, do you already have a family plot in a cemetery?

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.780
- Uh, no.
- We can help arrange that as well.

01:11:00.813 --> 01:11:02.682
Lakeview and Trinity Memorial

01:11:02.715 --> 01:11:05.486
are both wonderful locations
and very easy to work with.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.088
You may want to consider

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.056
thinking ahead now
for your mother's sake,

01:11:10.089 --> 01:11:12.592
about whether she would
eventually like to be interred

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:13.660
beside your father

01:11:13.692 --> 01:11:15.428
and you,
and your sister as well.

01:11:16.362 --> 01:11:17.697
The only reason I mention it

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:19.767
is that you would want to be sure
to plan a plot near your father.

01:11:57.670 --> 01:11:58.839
Hey.

01:12:00.839 --> 01:12:02.942
Thought you might need these.

01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:29.103
You have another
candy bar?

01:12:30.503 --> 01:12:32.106
How many have you had?

01:12:33.039 --> 01:12:34.206
Shut up.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.777
- The coconut enhances the flavor of the beer.
- Hmm.

01:12:38.777 --> 01:12:40.546
Thanks for coming.

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.983
Of course.

01:12:43.015 --> 01:12:45.952
I know you and dad
weren't the best of friends.

01:12:48.021 --> 01:12:49.590
Madison, I'm here for you.

01:12:51.457 --> 01:12:52.625
Why?

01:12:53.992 --> 01:12:55.995
Because I knew no one else
would be.

01:12:58.031 --> 01:13:00.867
My mom and sister
are here for me.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.903
Yeah, but eventually
you'd be the one to take over.

01:13:05.205 --> 01:13:07.174
That's always been your place
in your family.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.544
You're the one that makes sure
things get done.

01:13:12.478 --> 01:13:13.646
Hmm, thanks.

01:13:14.613 --> 01:13:15.715
You're welcome.

01:13:24.924 --> 01:13:25.926
How's work?

01:13:27.259 --> 01:13:28.461
It's good.

01:13:29.929 --> 01:13:32.065
We added two more
studio locations

01:13:32.098 --> 01:13:33.900
to handle
all the new students.

01:13:33.933 --> 01:13:35.202
Yeah, I heard.

01:13:35.235 --> 01:13:36.737
Really? From who?

01:13:38.838 --> 01:13:40.006
I looked online.

01:13:41.741 --> 01:13:42.776
Hmm.

01:13:45.644 --> 01:13:48.915
How about you?
Are you still working on your film?

01:13:50.616 --> 01:13:53.486
Yeah. I'm trying, um...

01:13:53.519 --> 01:13:55.522
Waiting on this producer
to get back to us.

01:13:57.089 --> 01:14:00.860
Gabe thinks there's still hope,
but I don't know.

01:14:03.763 --> 01:14:04.765
And how's work?

01:14:05.932 --> 01:14:07.568
Work is work, you know?

01:14:09.602 --> 01:14:12.738
There's potential for me to make
creative director at the agency.

01:14:12.772 --> 01:14:14.674
- Wow!
- Yeah.

01:14:14.706 --> 01:14:16.610
At least, this is
how I feel today.

01:14:16.643 --> 01:14:20.213
You ask me tomorrow, and I'll be an insecure mess.

01:14:20.245 --> 01:14:21.981
- It's pretty common, actually.
- Yeah.

01:14:23.816 --> 01:14:25.818
- Well, I'm glad to hear it.
- Hmm.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:28.220
- Not the insecure mess part, but
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:28.254 --> 01:14:29.890
- The rest of it.
- Yeah.

01:14:35.327 --> 01:14:36.862
Now's the part
where you ask me

01:14:36.896 --> 01:14:40.066
if I feel like I settled
by going into marketing.

01:14:40.098 --> 01:14:42.635
- Do you feel like...
- Don't actually ask me that.

01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:43.836
What?

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:45.606
It's rhetorical.
I don't want to answer that.

01:14:56.982 --> 01:14:58.584
Had you talked
to your dad lately?

01:15:00.586 --> 01:15:02.289
I had called him
on Father's Day.

01:15:04.323 --> 01:15:08.061
We didn't talk long 'cause
he wasn't feeling very well.

01:15:08.094 --> 01:15:10.130
I don't remember
what we talked about.

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:14.166
All I can remember
are his last words.

01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:18.071
Ernie, gotta go.

01:15:19.272 --> 01:15:21.707
Mom needs my help
in the kitchen.

01:15:22.808 --> 01:15:23.876
Ernie?

01:15:24.811 --> 01:15:26.112
Yeah. That's my boy name.

01:15:26.144 --> 01:15:27.714
Did I never tell you that?

01:15:27.746 --> 01:15:29.081
Your boy name?

01:15:29.115 --> 01:15:32.352
Yeah. That's the name they were
gonna call me if I was a boy.

01:15:32.384 --> 01:15:33.686
- Ernie?
- Yeah.

01:15:34.987 --> 01:15:36.121
What?

01:15:36.155 --> 01:15:38.058
Nothing.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:39.992
Let's just be
glad I'm a girl.

01:15:40.026 --> 01:15:41.327
Yeah, I certainly am.

01:15:43.396 --> 01:15:44.664
Do you have
a girl name?

01:15:44.696 --> 01:15:45.698
I don't know.

01:15:46.665 --> 01:15:48.034
I never asked.

01:15:48.067 --> 01:15:49.102
Hmm.

01:15:53.406 --> 01:15:55.008
What are you doing?

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.175
I'm asking.

01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:57.277
Now?

01:15:57.309 --> 01:15:58.579
Mm-hmm.

01:16:01.013 --> 01:16:02.682
Uh-oh, she's responded.

01:16:05.284 --> 01:16:06.620
Noelle.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.288
Noelle.

01:16:09.321 --> 01:16:10.590
Noah.

01:16:11.424 --> 01:16:12.659
Creative.

01:16:12.692 --> 01:16:13.727
Consistent.

01:16:21.299 --> 01:16:24.803
Whenever he called me Ernie,
it was like...

01:16:24.836 --> 01:16:26.839
something we
shared between us,

01:16:28.006 --> 01:16:31.077
like something
only for us.

01:16:35.281 --> 01:16:39.086
He could be so
loving and kind.

01:16:41.888 --> 01:16:45.659
And he'd turn around
and treat you like you're dead

01:16:45.692 --> 01:16:48.061
or yell at Mom for a mess
he had to clean up.

01:16:57.937 --> 01:16:59.906
And we...

01:16:59.938 --> 01:17:01.674
we raise our parents
up in our minds

01:17:01.707 --> 01:17:03.977
to be these... these icons.

01:17:06.179 --> 01:17:07.648
It's never that simple.

01:17:08.714 --> 01:17:11.684
They're human beings
just like us,

01:17:11.718 --> 01:17:14.187
and we have to love them
in spite of their flaws.

01:17:18.758 --> 01:17:21.228
It's kind of what they do with
us, when you think about it.

01:17:22.961 --> 01:17:26.700
Coming from the guy
whose dad wasn't sort of racist.

01:17:27.299 --> 01:17:28.735
That's true.

01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:30.904
That is true.
I do have perfect parents.

01:17:30.937 --> 01:17:33.238
It's probably why I'm so wise.

01:17:33.272 --> 01:17:34.741
Jerk.

01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:50.923
What happened to us?

01:18:42.275 --> 01:18:44.076
- Madison... Madison...
- Wh-what...

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.245
I can't... I can't.

01:18:45.277 --> 01:18:46.945
Well, why?

01:18:46.978 --> 01:18:48.347
Have you been
with anyone else?

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:50.082
No. No.

01:18:50.116 --> 01:18:51.151
Have you?

01:18:51.183 --> 01:18:54.387
No, of course not.
We're still technically married.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.922
Right.

01:18:56.388 --> 01:18:58.223
I just...

01:18:58.256 --> 01:19:01.294
I don't want
to complicate things.

01:19:01.326 --> 01:19:02.594
You and... You and I,

01:19:02.629 --> 01:19:05.098
we've never really worked
through any of our issues, and...

01:19:06.598 --> 01:19:08.802
I don't... I don't want
to be that guy.

01:19:08.835 --> 01:19:10.270
What guy?

01:19:11.237 --> 01:19:13.540
Your father died.

01:19:13.572 --> 01:19:15.508
And I don't want to be the kind
that takes advantage.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.110
You're not
taking advantage.

01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:20.013
I'm the aggressor here.

01:19:20.045 --> 01:19:22.281
It doesn't make it
any better.

01:19:22.314 --> 01:19:23.348
Actually, it kind of makes

01:19:23.381 --> 01:19:24.416
- my point for me.
- Noah.

01:19:26.885 --> 01:19:28.854
You came here
to help me.

01:19:30.622 --> 01:19:32.224
This is what I want.

01:19:33.491 --> 01:19:36.362
This is what
I need right now.

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:41.034
I need to get lost in you
for a little while.

01:19:42.934 --> 01:19:44.804
Forget all that stuff.

01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:49.008
Are you sure?

01:19:51.911 --> 01:19:54.080
Stop being so whiny.

01:19:55.147 --> 01:19:56.850
It's killing my mood.

01:20:08.294 --> 01:20:09.329
Thank you.

01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:12.599
One thing real quick.

01:20:12.631 --> 01:20:13.599
What?

01:20:13.633 --> 01:20:15.934
Do you mind just going.
um, to the bathroom

01:20:15.968 --> 01:20:17.470
and brushing your teeth,

01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:20.072
or using a mouthwash
or something?

01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:21.974
Why?

01:20:22.008 --> 01:20:25.111
You just... You taste like
that beer you've been drinking.

01:20:25.143 --> 01:20:27.313
You know I hate
the taste of beer.

01:20:28.113 --> 01:20:29.549
Yeah.

01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:31.284
No, really.

01:20:31.317 --> 01:20:33.920
I feel like I picked you up
in a bar.

01:20:36.022 --> 01:20:37.057
Please.

01:20:38.323 --> 01:20:39.326
Okay.

01:20:40.558 --> 01:20:41.960
Yeah.
Sure.

01:20:41.994 --> 01:20:43.196
Thank you.

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.280
All right.
All minty fresh.

01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:40.387
Um...

01:21:41.387 --> 01:21:42.956
Um, maybe...

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:45.090
Maybe you're right.

01:21:46.759 --> 01:21:48.194
Well, of course.

01:21:52.263 --> 01:21:53.298
I should go.

01:21:53.331 --> 01:21:55.434
No, no. Please. Please don't.

01:21:55.468 --> 01:21:57.670
Maddy, I...
I can't stay here.

01:21:57.702 --> 01:21:59.004
Please.

01:22:03.275 --> 01:22:05.978
I'll stay until you fall asleep.

01:22:06.012 --> 01:22:07.080
Okay.

01:23:07.372 --> 01:23:08.707
So let's hear it.

01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:11.276
Let's hear what?

01:23:11.844 --> 01:23:13.079
Your pitch.

01:23:14.345 --> 01:23:15.381
My pitch?

01:23:17.849 --> 01:23:19.485
You obviously planned
everything here

01:23:19.518 --> 01:23:21.521
to try to convince me
not to go through with it.

01:23:23.488 --> 01:23:25.290
So go ahead.

01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:28.727
Nah.

01:23:30.728 --> 01:23:31.764
"Nah?"

01:23:33.365 --> 01:23:34.601
What does that mean?

01:23:37.369 --> 01:23:39.171
Just... nah.

01:23:43.875 --> 01:23:45.577
So I mean
nothing to you?

01:23:47.146 --> 01:23:48.814
Maddie, I didn't
want to meet here

01:23:48.848 --> 01:23:50.383
to try to convince you.

01:23:51.616 --> 01:23:53.251
There are no
magic words I can say

01:23:53.285 --> 01:23:55.155
that'll turn back time
and change things.

01:23:57.188 --> 01:23:58.590
We were married long
enough for me to know

01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:01.294
that the only thing that
convinces you are my actions.

01:24:02.728 --> 01:24:05.531
My actions were
screwed up enough that

01:24:05.563 --> 01:24:07.299
I can't change them
with words.

01:24:09.602 --> 01:24:11.171
I used to think that.

01:24:13.238 --> 01:24:15.340
But now I know
it's all just a fantasy.

01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:20.713
It's not how
real people deal with life.

01:24:26.384 --> 01:24:28.353
Honestly, I just...

01:24:28.387 --> 01:24:30.523
I just wanted to meet here
because it reminds me of

01:24:31.756 --> 01:24:33.093
how we felt

01:24:35.193 --> 01:24:36.463
the day
we said "I do."

01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:46.171
I haven't felt that
in a long time.

01:24:48.439 --> 01:24:51.277
and I thought maybe
being here with you,

01:24:52.210 --> 01:24:54.379
I might feel that again.

01:24:55.281 --> 01:24:56.515
Just a little.

01:24:59.919 --> 01:25:01.121
And, yeah,

01:25:02.521 --> 01:25:05.625
I thought we both might
feel it a little.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.263
Do you feel it?

01:25:18.403 --> 01:25:19.705
I don't think so.

01:25:21.506 --> 01:25:22.909
I just feel regret.

01:25:22.942 --> 01:25:24.677
So I guess
it backfired on me.

01:25:28.847 --> 01:25:30.450
You have the papers?

01:25:51.503 --> 01:25:52.804
You have a pen?

01:25:56.875 --> 01:25:57.877
What?

01:25:59.844 --> 01:26:02.615
Who carries pens anymore?
Everything's electronic.

01:26:03.482 --> 01:26:04.551
Not this.

01:26:06.018 --> 01:26:07.487
No, not this.

01:26:12.957 --> 01:26:14.559
Where?

01:26:14.593 --> 01:26:17.597
Initial here, here,
and sign there.

01:27:00.673 --> 01:27:02.275
Why are we
shaking hands?

01:27:03.842 --> 01:27:04.844
I don't know.

01:27:06.812 --> 01:27:09.749
Um... More official this way?

01:27:16.988 --> 01:27:18.957
Bye... I guess.

01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:27.599
Noah, come back
and sit down, please.

01:27:27.633 --> 01:27:28.668
Why?

01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:32.438
Just don't walk away.

01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:34.439
Just please, come sit down.

01:27:37.608 --> 01:27:38.844
Walk away.

01:27:40.079 --> 01:27:42.380
It's funny.

01:27:42.414 --> 01:27:45.751
You know, I'm not the one
who wanted to get a divorce.

01:27:45.784 --> 01:27:46.986
Please?

01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:10.608
You didn't want
to get a divorce,

01:28:10.642 --> 01:28:12.644
but you didn't want
to fix things either.

01:28:15.981 --> 01:28:18.517
Now, at the risk of
sounding petty,

01:28:18.549 --> 01:28:19.750
now that we're
officially divorced,

01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:23.122
do I still have to sit here
and get lectured on my flaws?

01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:24.423
I don't want to be here either.

01:28:24.455 --> 01:28:25.523
But this isn't all my fault.

01:28:25.557 --> 01:28:26.791
I never said it was
all your fault.

01:28:26.825 --> 01:28:28.027
Why couldn't you put me first?

01:28:28.994 --> 01:28:31.863
Why was your career
more important than mine?

01:28:31.897 --> 01:28:34.100
What about my dreams
and my plans?

01:28:39.905 --> 01:28:41.506
Maddie, I don't know.

01:28:43.174 --> 01:28:46.945
I don't know why my career
was so important to me.

01:28:46.978 --> 01:28:48.780
It was. I know.

01:28:50.782 --> 01:28:53.084
I wanted to do something
great with my films.

01:28:53.117 --> 01:28:54.687
I wanted to touch
people's hearts.

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:57.122
I wanted to change their lives.

01:28:57.156 --> 01:28:59.492
That sounds silly now because

01:28:59.525 --> 01:29:01.126
I couldn't even get
my own shit together.

01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:04.630
Sorry.

01:29:06.564 --> 01:29:10.035
The truth is, you were right
and I was wrong.

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.973
I regret it all, because,

01:29:15.006 --> 01:29:17.442
as much as I still hope

01:29:17.476 --> 01:29:19.711
I have a chance of making films
that matter to people,

01:29:23.014 --> 01:29:24.784
I'd rather be with you.

01:29:31.889 --> 01:29:33.459
So what can I say?

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.796
I screwed it up because

01:29:40.198 --> 01:29:43.035
I was too immature to see all
of that until it was too late.

01:29:46.604 --> 01:29:48.107
I accept the blame.

01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:51.677
And I'm sorry.

01:29:53.845 --> 01:29:56.848
I've heard the apologies before.

01:29:57.683 --> 01:29:59.118
I understand that.

01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:03.522
I have nothing to gain.

01:30:04.255 --> 01:30:05.791
Nothing to prove.

01:30:07.893 --> 01:30:09.429
I'm just sorry.

01:30:24.942 --> 01:30:26.478
It's not all your fault.

01:30:33.818 --> 01:30:35.888
I wanted to be a dancer,

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.990
and clearly that wasn't
going to happen.

01:30:40.692 --> 01:30:43.262
It was like cold water
on my face.

01:30:43.295 --> 01:30:44.930
Seeing how good
everyone else was

01:30:44.963 --> 01:30:47.532
at something that
I loved so much.

01:30:50.168 --> 01:30:51.571
I was good.

01:30:53.037 --> 01:30:54.072
Yes, you were.

01:30:57.808 --> 01:30:59.678
But not near good enough.

01:31:02.013 --> 01:31:03.415
Time kept ticking away.

01:31:03.448 --> 01:31:08.987
And I can never rehearse or audition
as much as I needed to, so...

01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:13.992
becoming a mom,

01:31:15.994 --> 01:31:17.863
that consumed me.

01:31:20.933 --> 01:31:23.202
You know, I never really
even wanted kids

01:31:23.235 --> 01:31:24.269
when we got married.

01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:32.678
Then that got taken away
from me, too.

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:35.914
And when the doctor told us
we couldn't have kids, I just...

01:31:38.082 --> 01:31:39.117
I shut down.

01:31:41.286 --> 01:31:44.256
And I didn't let you
or anyone in, and...

01:31:47.092 --> 01:31:48.693
that's my fault,

01:31:50.696 --> 01:31:53.032
'cause it just...
It drove us further apart.

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:03.875
Um...

01:32:08.813 --> 01:32:09.848
Thank you.

01:32:12.317 --> 01:32:14.820
I wish I had known
some of that before.

01:32:19.290 --> 01:32:22.193
I wish I had been smart
enough to see it for myself.

01:32:24.196 --> 01:32:25.932
I could have told you.

01:32:27.098 --> 01:32:29.134
I don't know why
I waited till now.

01:32:39.978 --> 01:32:41.013
Noah...

01:32:46.284 --> 01:32:50.054
I want to be okay
with the fact that

01:32:50.088 --> 01:32:52.959
I'll never be the dancer
I dreamed of being,

01:32:55.059 --> 01:32:56.595
but I'm not.

01:32:58.964 --> 01:33:00.899
I want to be okay
with the fact that

01:33:00.932 --> 01:33:03.769
I'll never be able
to have children.

01:33:05.704 --> 01:33:06.906
But I'm not.

01:33:10.442 --> 01:33:13.345
I want to be okay
with the fact that

01:33:13.378 --> 01:33:17.849
you've constantly put me in
second position behind your career

01:33:17.883 --> 01:33:19.619
and my career
behind that,

01:33:20.986 --> 01:33:22.688
but I'm not.

01:33:24.856 --> 01:33:28.093
I want to be okay
with the fact that

01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:31.830
you take your frustrations
about your career out on me.

01:33:33.064 --> 01:33:34.200
But I'm not.

01:33:36.867 --> 01:33:40.004
I want you to be okay with the
fact that you might never be

01:33:40.037 --> 01:33:42.340
that filmmaker
that changes the world

01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:46.379
but I know
that you're not.

01:33:49.747 --> 01:33:51.717
And maybe you never will be.

01:33:54.352 --> 01:33:56.689
I want to be okay
with the fact that...

01:33:58.356 --> 01:34:00.059
my dad died

01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:03.795
before I could directly
deal with his racism

01:34:03.829 --> 01:34:05.363
and the way that
he treated you.

01:34:07.898 --> 01:34:12.871
I'm ashamed that I never did,
because I had plenty of time.

01:34:15.307 --> 01:34:18.911
I want to be okay
with being a coward

01:34:18.943 --> 01:34:23.014
and not being able to reconcile
the idea of my daddy...

01:34:24.515 --> 01:34:25.951
who I loved...

01:34:27.853 --> 01:34:31.957
with this man who believed such
horrible things about the world.

01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:34.726
But I'm not okay with that.

01:34:34.759 --> 01:34:37.428
And... And he's dead,

01:34:37.461 --> 01:34:39.397
And I'll never
be able to fix it.

01:34:41.866 --> 01:34:43.201
I want to be okay
with the fact

01:34:43.235 --> 01:34:45.137
that 14 years
into our marriage,

01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:48.941
it's nothing like
I thought it would be.

01:34:50.407 --> 01:34:52.445
It's full of
a lot of raw...

01:34:53.378 --> 01:34:54.380
shit...

01:34:55.213 --> 01:34:57.282
that I never saw coming

01:34:57.314 --> 01:35:01.085
and that neither of us
responded particularly well to.

01:35:01.119 --> 01:35:03.121
But I'm not okay
with that either.

01:35:07.224 --> 01:35:09.327
I'm not okay
with any of it.

01:35:10.829 --> 01:35:11.863
My life,

01:35:12.897 --> 01:35:15.433
our life together
it's... it's...

01:35:15.467 --> 01:35:18.937
nothing like I
wanted or imagined.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:26.512
I really, really want
to be okay with it.

01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:33.818
And...

01:35:36.187 --> 01:35:37.822
I don't know, I mean...

01:35:40.991 --> 01:35:42.293
maybe...

01:35:44.495 --> 01:35:47.298
wanting to be okay with it

01:35:49.166 --> 01:35:50.769
is enough

01:35:51.503 --> 01:35:52.972
for now.

01:36:45.557 --> 01:36:47.226
Are you gonna write about this?

01:36:52.397 --> 01:36:54.366
You're going to write
about this, aren't you?

01:37:36.685 --> 01:37:38.544
