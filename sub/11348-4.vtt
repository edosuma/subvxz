IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.542 --> 00:12.213
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.648
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.682 --> 00:16.550
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.584 --> 00:18.219
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:18.252 --> 00:20.354
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.489
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.091 --> 00:26.094
- HI, HOLDEN MARCH HERE.

00:27.495 --> 00:31.232
LOOK AT THEM. LOOK AT
ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.602
ALL OF THEM OUT ON DATES,
HAVING FUN,

00:34.635 --> 00:37.171
FLIRTING, KISSING.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.073
IT'S SATURDAY AFTERNOON,

00:39.107 --> 00:43.844
AND EVERYBODY IS OUT AND ABOUT
WITH THEIR LOVERS,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.813
EXCEPT FOR ME.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.382
IT IS NOT FAIR.

00:48.416 --> 00:51.152
WHY DO THESE GIRLS
ONLY GO OUT WITH JERKS,

00:51.185 --> 00:56.357
WHILE I, DESPITE HAVING
SO MUCH TO OFFER, AM ALONE?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.327
[ominous music]

00:59.360 --> 01:02.163
*

01:12.640 --> 01:15.809
- JUST BREATHE.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.478
MOMMY'S HERE.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.680
- LIV?
- HEY.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.182
- HOW'S NOAH?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.516
- HE'S FINALLY FELL ASLEEP.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.852
HIS FEVER'S DOWN.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.121
- DETECTIVE AMARO
CALLED MY CELL.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.356
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE
STILL HERE,

01:28.389 --> 01:29.590
BUT YOUR PHONE'S OFF.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.824
- OH, RIGHT.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.426
- HE SAID IT'S URGENT.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.794
- YEAH.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.329
- I'LL STAY WITH HIM.

01:35.363 --> 01:39.267
- OKAY. YOU'LL WAIT WITH NOAH
TILL I COME BACK?

01:39.300 --> 01:40.334
- YES. YEAH.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.902
OF COURSE.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.337
- OKAY.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.472
ALL RIGHT.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.573
THANKS, LUCY.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.679
[police radio chatter]

01:51.712 --> 01:54.515
- NYPD. COMING THROUGH.
NYPD.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.217
- HEY, SORRY TO CALL,

01:56.250 --> 01:57.551
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF PRESS HERE ALREADY.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.320
- ASSAULT IN CENTRAL PARK?
I HAVE TO BE HERE.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.254
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

02:00.288 --> 02:01.355
- THE SUSPECT'S A MALE WHITE,

02:01.389 --> 02:02.823
EARLY 20s,
AVERAGE HEIGHT.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.894
STABBED THE VIC--GWEN YOUNG,
22--REPEATEDLY, ATTEMPTED RAPE.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.429
- BUT SHE'S LUCKY.
MOST OF HER WOUNDS WERE SHALLOW.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.563
SHE'S OUT OF IT.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.632
- ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S NO PRO.

02:11.665 --> 02:12.766
SHE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?
- NOT MUCH.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.535
THE EMTs
WERE TENDING TO HER WOUNDS.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.338
THOUGH, SHE DID TELL ME
THAT HER ASSAILANT

02:17.371 --> 02:19.540
COUNTED OUT
EACH TIME HE STABBED HER.

02:19.573 --> 02:20.708
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.243
ANY WITNESSES?

02:22.276 --> 02:23.177
- A DOG WALKER FOUND HER.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.945
DIDN'T SEE THE PERP.
UNIS ARE CANVASSING.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.181
- OKAY, UH, LET'S GET TO
THE HOSPITAL.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.349
I WANT TO TALK TO HER
AS SOON AS SHE'S ABLE.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.617
- HEY, HOW'S NOAH?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.852
- UH, HE'S A FIGHTER.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.588
HE'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.590
[siren wails]

02:42.496 --> 02:43.897
- IDIOTS.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.335
I'M RIGHT THERE,
AND NO ONE EVEN NOTICES ME.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.570
NO ONE EVER NOTICES ME,

02:49.603 --> 02:52.806
BUT THAT IS ALL
GOING TO CHANGE.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.611
VERY SOON,
EVERYONE WILL KNOW WHO I AM.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.347
[chuckles]

03:01.515 --> 03:04.485
[dramatic music]

03:48.996 --> 03:49.397
.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.398
- THANK YOU, LUCY.
I'LL BE THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.301
IT'S A NEW SHIFT,
MAKE SURE THAT THE NURSE KNOWS

03:53.334 --> 03:54.902
THAT HIS TEMPERATURE
RUNS A LITTLE LOW, OKAY?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.770
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.439
HOW'S GWEN?

03:58.472 --> 03:59.940
- SHE'S STABILIZED
AND TALKING.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.375
HEY, LOOK,
ROLLINS AND I GOT THIS.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.443
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.944
- UNTIL I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS, I DO.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.813
- CAN I DO ANYTHING?
- I GOT THIS.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.549
ACTUALLY, NICK,
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.050
- ANYTHING.
- IS THERE, UH...

04:10.083 --> 04:12.286
ANY WAY MAYBE
YOU COULD CALL YOUR MOTHER

04:12.320 --> 04:14.522
AND ASK HER TO RELIEVE LUCY
AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A MINUTE?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.524
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M ON IT.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.625
- THANK YOU.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.792
- HEY.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.529
- HEY.
GWEN, THIS IS SERGEANT BENSON.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.930
- HI.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.498
- SHE WAS JUST TELLING ME
THAT SHE DIDN'T SEE

04:24.532 --> 04:26.367
HER ATTACKER
BEFORE THE ASSAULT.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.901
- I LEFT SOME FRIENDS
AT THE BOATHOUSE,

04:27.935 --> 04:29.570
STARTED WALKING HOME.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.971
- SO YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
HIM AT ALL.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.607
- HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,
A KNIFE TO MY NECK.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.610
I SHOULD HAVE RUN OR SCREAMED,
BUT I JUST FROZE.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.980
- A KNIFE TO YOUR NECK,
IT'S NORMAL TO FREEZE.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.583
- OKAY.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.620
HE PUSHED ME PAST
THE PLAYGROUNDS INTO THE BUSHES.

04:46.654 --> 04:51.492
HE GRABBED MY BREASTS,
LIFTED UP MY SKIRT, GROPED.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.627
- BUT HE DIDN'T RAPE YOU?

04:53.661 --> 04:55.363
- NO.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.532
HE DIDN'T SEEM
TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.601
I PUSHED HIM AWAY,
I SAID, "GET OFF ME."

05:00.634 --> 05:03.604
THAT'S WHEN HE GOT ANGRY,
THREW ME DOWN,

05:03.637 --> 05:06.340
STARTED STABBING ME.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.508
- AND YOU TOLD ME BEFORE

05:07.541 --> 05:10.478
THAT HE COUNTED EACH TIME
HE STABBED?

05:10.511 --> 05:11.545
- YEAH.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.482
I THOUGHT
HE WAS GOING TO KILL ME.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.016
[sniffles] UM...

05:16.049 --> 05:19.887
BUT AS SOON AS HE GOT TO 11,
HE STOPPED AND HE RAN.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.055
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.592
- HE SAID,
"THIS IS YOUR FAULT, GIGI.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.959
YOU MISSED YOUR CHANCE."

05:25.993 --> 05:27.495
- GIGI?

05:27.528 --> 05:29.530
- IT'S AN OLD NICKNAME.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.599
- MAYBE YOU USE IT ON
YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, OR...

05:31.632 --> 05:32.900
- NO ONE'S CALLED ME
THAT SINCE

05:32.933 --> 05:35.369
HIGH SCHOOL,
MAYBE NINTH GRADE.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.005
- OKAY, SO THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO
KNEW YOU WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG?

05:38.038 --> 05:41.074
- NO. I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED
SOMEONE LIKE THAT.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.844
I HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
IN MY LIFE.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.348
- [sighs]

05:48.382 --> 05:50.418
- HE CALLS HER
BY HER OLD NICKNAME

05:50.451 --> 05:51.519
AND COUNTS AS HE STABS HER?

05:51.552 --> 05:52.686
IT'S GOTTA BE PERSONAL.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.655
- EXCEPT GWEN
DOESN'T KNOW HIM.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.924
AMARO, ANY LUCK
WITH THOSE YEARBOOKS?

05:56.957 --> 05:58.626
- THERE'S A FEW GUYS
WHO HAD RECORDS,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.160
RUN-INS WITH THE S.E.C.
FOR STOCK FRAUD.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.062
NO ONE ON THE REGISTRY,
NO ASSAULTS.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.597
- I GOT
OUR BEST SKETCH ARTIST ON IT,

06:03.631 --> 06:06.166
BUT GWEN DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.134
- AND THAT'S
WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.937
THAT'S EVERY OTHER WHITE GUY
IN WILLIAMSBURG.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.172
- OKAY, SO NO LUCK
WITH THE SCHOOLS.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.608
WHAT ABOUT NEIGHBORS?
SHE GREW UP IN GRAMERCY.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.176
RUN THE BUILDING,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.511
RUN THE BLOCK.
[telephone rings]

06:17.545 --> 06:19.046
DID SHE GO TO CHURCH,
SUMMER CAMP?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.014
- I WILL CHECK IT OUT.
- TUTOULA, SVU.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.617
- HE WAITED
UNTIL HER FRIENDS LEFT,

06:23.651 --> 06:25.519
SO HE TARGETED HER.

06:25.553 --> 06:26.687
THE COUNTING,
THAT'S OBSESSIVE.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.622
ARE THERE
ANY OPEN M.O.s THAT FIT?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.958
- I MEAN, AMATEURISH WOUNDS,
STALKING THE VIC, REVENGE--

06:30.991 --> 06:32.726
IT'S A ONE OFF SO FAR.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.595
- LET'S HOPE HE DOESN'T DEVELOP
A TASTE FOR IT.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.029
- TOO LATE.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.665
ANOTHER ATTEMPTED RAPE
IN THE ONE-TWO.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.601
ASSAILANT COUNTED OUT LOUD
AS HE STABBED HER.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.536
- FIN, ROLLINS, GO.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.140
- DID YOU NOTICE
ANYONE FOLLOWING YOU?

06:47.174 --> 06:50.143
- NO. IT WAS 6:00 AM,
THE STREETS WERE EMPTY.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.079
- YOU WERE ON YOUR WAY
TO WORK?

06:52.112 --> 06:55.483
- I WAS ACTUALLY COMING HOME
FROM A DATE.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.618
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED, HALEY?

06:57.651 --> 07:00.153
- I OPENED MY BUILDING DOOR.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.022
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,

07:02.055 --> 07:04.525
PUSHED ME IN, DRAGGED ME
BEHIND THE STAIRS,

07:04.558 --> 07:05.926
AND PULLED A KNIFE.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.529
HE GRABBED MY BREAST,
MY LEGS,

07:08.562 --> 07:10.598
TRIED TO STICK HIS FINGERS
INSIDE ME.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.100
- HE TRIED?
BUT HE DIDN'T RAPE YOU?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.503
- I PUSHED HIM AWAY.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.436
I SCREAMED,

07:16.470 --> 07:18.506
I TOLD HIM TO GET
HIS F'ING HANDS OFF ME.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.140
THAT'S WHEN HE LOST IT.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.542
- AND STARTED STABBING YOU?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.243
- MORE LIKE FLAILING.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.580
I WAS FIGHTING HIM OFF.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.617
HE COUNTED EACH STAB,
15 OF THEM.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.252
HIS VOICE WAS FLAT,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.154
AND HE HAD THIS...

07:34.187 --> 07:35.523
WEIRD SMILE.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.957
THEN HE STOPPED.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.926
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.495
YEAH, ACTUALLY.

07:41.529 --> 07:45.599
WHEN HE STARTED, HE SAID,
"I KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE, HALEY."

07:45.633 --> 07:49.002
- SO HE KNEW YOUR NAME,
BUT YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.138
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.973
- IS THIS THE GUY?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.510
- IT LOOKS LIKE HIM,
I GUESS.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.011
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER HIM

07:58.045 --> 07:59.680
FROM SCHOOL OR WORK?

07:59.713 --> 08:02.215
- NO, BUT WHEN I RESISTED,

08:02.249 --> 08:06.654
HE ACCUSED ME OF NOT LIKING HIM
BECAUSE HE WASN'T BLACK.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.557
- THE GUY YOU WERE DATING
LAST NIGHT, WAS HE BLACK?

08:09.590 --> 08:11.191
- NO. HE WAS IRISH.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.926
WE MET AT A BAR.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
- HAD YOU DATED
ANY BLACK GUYS RECENTLY?

08:14.962 --> 08:19.232
- WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
A GUY ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM,

08:19.266 --> 08:21.001
BUT NOT SINCE THEN.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.008
- I UNDERSTAND, CHIEF.
YES, SIR.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.242
- ONE-P-P?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.678
- OH, THAT WAS DODDS...AGAIN.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.312
- NEW DEPUTY CHIEF OF SVU.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.513
- YEAH, CITYWIDE,

08:33.547 --> 08:36.149
AND HE WANTS TO DO A FULL
PRESS CONFERENCE ON THIS PERP.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.685
- OF COURSE HE DOES.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.820
SO GUESS HE'S DECIDED
THAT IT'S ONLY ONE GUY?

08:39.853 --> 08:42.155
- HE HAS, AND I TOLD HIM THAT
THAT WAS OUR JOB,

08:42.189 --> 08:44.692
AND WE'RE STILL DECIDING WHETHER
OR NOT TO MAKE THAT CALL.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.027
SO ANY DNA YET?

08:47.060 --> 08:49.329
- IN BOTH ATTACKS,
THE PERP FAILED TO LAUNCH.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.131
- AND FROM
A VICTIMOLOGY PERSPECTIVE,

08:51.164 --> 08:52.866
THEY'RE BOTH
IN THEIR EARLY 20s,

08:52.900 --> 08:54.167
BLONDE, THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE,

08:54.201 --> 08:55.803
AND HE CALLED THEM
BOTH BY NAME,

08:55.836 --> 08:58.038
KNEW PERSONAL DETAILS
FROM THEIR PAST.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.873
- HE ALSO COUNTED
OUT THE STABS.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.809
MELINDA SAID THE WOUNDS WERE
CONSISTENT ENOUGH

09:01.842 --> 09:03.677
THAT THEY COULD HAVE COME
FROM THE SAME KNIFE.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.345
- WELL, IF IT IS THE SAME GUY,
HE'S ESCALATING.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.180
THERE'S FEWER HESITATION MARKS
ON HALEY.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.682
HE'S GETTING
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.317
- AND THE VICS
DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER?

09:10.350 --> 09:11.885
- DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS,
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.654
NO POINTS OF INTERSECTION,

09:13.687 --> 09:15.288
AND NEITHER ONE RECOGNIZED
HER ASSAILANT.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.625
- ALL RIGHT, SO FIND OUT
IF ANYBODY ELSE DOES.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.226
CHECK OPEN CASES.

09:19.259 --> 09:24.064
SHOW THIS SKETCH TO ANY VICS
OF UNKNOWN KNIFE ASSAULTS.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.800
- OKAY, AND WHAT DO WE RELEASE
TO THE PRESS?

09:26.834 --> 09:28.168
- THIS SKETCH.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.269
I GUESS WE WORK
OFF THE ASSUMPTION

09:29.302 --> 09:30.203
THAT IT IS THE SAME GUY

09:30.237 --> 09:32.640
AND THESE ARE
HIS FIRST KNOWN ASSAULTS.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.875
ROLLINS, WHAT NUMBER
ARE WE UP TO THIS YEAR?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.645
- LUCKY PATTERN 13.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.647
- HE DIDN'T STAB ME,
BUT HE HAD A KNIFE.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.148
HE THREW ME DOWN.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.282
- COULD THIS HAVE BEEN HIM?

09:42.315 --> 09:45.753
- NO, THE GUY THAT DID ME
HAD A SCAR DOWN HIS CHEEK.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.689
- DID HE KNOW YOUR NAME
OR ANYTHING ABOUT YOU?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.658
- YES, ACTUALLY.
HE CALLED ME J.L.,

09:50.691 --> 09:51.859
WHICH ARE MY INITIALS.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.360
- ISN'T YOUR NAME
JEAN ASHER?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.629
- MY MIDDLE NAME IS LOUISE.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.230
I USED TO
WORK IN THIS RESTAURANT.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.633
THERE WAS GIRL THERE NAMED
JEAN-ANNE ALREADY,

09:59.667 --> 10:01.835
SO WE USED TO CALL HER J.A.
AND ME J.L.,

10:01.869 --> 10:02.903
YOU KNOW,
TO AVOID CONFUSION.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.005
- UH, ROLLINS.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.741
JEAN HERE WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT A GUY

10:07.775 --> 10:10.210
WHO PULLED A KNIFE ON HER
IN CHELSEA PARK FOUR DAYS AGO.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.245
- NOTHING HAPPENED.
HE GOT SCARED OFF.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.181
- HE KNEW HER INITIALS,

10:14.214 --> 10:15.348
WHICH YOU WENT
BY AT WHAT RESTAURANT?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.784
- CATIGNANO'S,
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.351
IT WAS ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.388
- OKAY. WERE YOU EVER INVOLVED
WITH ANYBODY AT THE RESTAURANT?

10:21.421 --> 10:22.890
- THE MANAGER'S MY EX.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.257
KINDA HOW I GOT THE JOB.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.325
- ARE YOU STILL
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

10:25.358 --> 10:26.894
- YEAH.
- ANYBODY ELSE?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.429
LIKE A CO-WORKER, A WAITER,
A CUSTOMER, EVEN.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.699
ANYBODY THERE SEEM JEALOUS?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.433
- NO, I GOT ALONG
WITH EVERYONE.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.369
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY
BEING JEALOUS.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.271
- [moaning]

10:38.305 --> 10:39.707
[pounding on wall]

10:39.740 --> 10:41.709
- AGAIN? WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

10:41.742 --> 10:42.843
[pounding on wall]

10:42.876 --> 10:44.244
- JUST IGNORE HIM.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.847
IGNORE HIM.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.350
[woman moaning,
headboard thumping]

10:50.383 --> 10:52.986
- LISTEN TO THEM,
RUTTING LIKE ANIMALS,

10:53.020 --> 10:56.223
TAUNTING ME
WITH WHAT I CANNOT HAVE.

10:56.256 --> 11:00.894
ALL OF YOU WOMEN WHO WILL NOT
LOOK AT ME OR KISS ME,

11:00.928 --> 11:03.296
GIVING YOURSELVES
TO OTHER MEN,

11:03.330 --> 11:06.466
GIVING SEX TO MEN
WHO DO NOT LOVE YOU,

11:06.499 --> 11:08.368
WHO USE YOUR BODIES.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.304
[woman moaning]

11:12.773 --> 11:15.275
I WOULD KNOW
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

11:15.308 --> 11:16.443
TO WORSHIP YOU,

11:16.476 --> 11:19.880
BUT ALL
OF YOU BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,

11:19.913 --> 11:23.784
YOU THROW YOURSELVES AT MEN
WHO ARE MEAN AND SELFISH.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.720
SWEATING, GRUNTING BRUTES.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.356
[ominous music]

11:29.389 --> 11:31.391
YOU REJECT ME--

11:31.424 --> 11:36.429
A NICE GUY, SMART,
SUPERB, CLEAN.

11:36.463 --> 11:41.268
I DRESS WELL,
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

11:46.774 --> 11:51.344
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF YOU,
BEEN GENTLE.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.513
BUT THOSE DAYS ARE GONE.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.382
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.218
YOU DO NOT DESERVE ME ANYMORE.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.454
YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO LIVE.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.294
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:15.268 --> 12:15.468
.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.303
- SO WHERE ARE WE
ON THAT RESTAURANT?

12:17.004 --> 12:18.505
HAVE YOU REACHED
THE MANAGER YET?

12:18.538 --> 12:19.840
I UNDERSTAND
THAT NOBODY'S I.D.'d HIM,

12:19.873 --> 12:21.041
BUT RESTAURANTS
HAVE TURNOVER.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.911
YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU SPEAK TO THAT MANAGER, OKAY?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.846
NICK, I GOTTA GO.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.281
DR. LEE.
NOAH LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.417
HIS COLOR'S COME BACK.
HE'S SMILING.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.451
THANK YOU.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.020
- HE'S STABILIZED FOR NOW.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.154
HE'S BREATHING ON HIS OWN.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.223
GREAT.
WHEN CAN I TAKE HIM HOME?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.158
- WE'D LIKE TO KEEP HIM
A FEW MORE DAYS.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.092
- WHY?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.128
- NOAH'S BIRTH MOTHER
WAS A DRUG ADDICT?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.931
- YES. HE HASN'T HAD MUCH
PRENATAL OR INFANT CARE,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.198
BUT WE ARE ALL CAUGHT UP.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.300
HE'S HAD HIS VACCINATIONS,
HIS WEIGHT--

12:47.334 --> 12:49.236
- YOU BROUGHT HIM INTO YOUR HOME
FOUR MONTHS AGO?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.404
BEFORE THAT,
MULTIPLE FOSTER CARE HOMES?

12:51.438 --> 12:55.275
- YES, BUT SINCE THEN,
HE'S BEEN THRIVING.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.844
- NOT TO ALARM YOU,

12:56.877 --> 12:59.012
BUT HIS LUNG X-RAYS SHOWED
OLD RIB FRACTURES.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.381
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
IN FOSTER CARE INFANTS.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.016
WERE THE HOMES VETTED?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.052
- YES.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.855
BUT THE FIRST 2 1/2 MONTHS
OF HIS LIFE,

13:07.888 --> 13:10.924
HE WAS...
NOT IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT,

13:10.958 --> 13:14.962
BUT CHILD SERVICES SAID THAT
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ABUSE.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.429
- HOW HARD DID THEY LOOK?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.398
WE NEED TO DO
A MORE THOROUGH WORKUP.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.033
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.168
HE'S HAD SO MANY NEEDLES.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.003
- NO NEEDLES.
SKELETAL X-RAY, CT SCAN.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.872
- BUT HE'S
DEVELOPING NORMALLY.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.107
- HE HAS LUNG ISSUES.
HE HAD IT ROUGH EARLY ON.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.342
SOMETIMES COMPLICATIONS
FROM TRAUMA DEVELOP LATER,

13:29.376 --> 13:31.378
PHYSIOLOGICALLY
AND NEUROLOGICALLY.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.013
HE CAN'T TELL US
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.115
I'D LIKE TO BE
PROACTIVE HERE.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.121
- SORRY
I DIDN'T GET BACK TO YOU.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.555
THIS IS ABOUT J.L.?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.024
SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THE GUY WHO ATTACKED HER.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.158
- BUT MAYBE
SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.260
- WHEN J.L. WORKED HERE,
WAS THERE ANYONE SHE REJECTED

13:47.294 --> 13:49.096
OR SOMEONE
WHO HAD A CRUSH ON HER?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.998
- SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.934
- WELL, YOU REMEMBER ANYONE
WHO LOOKED LIKE THIS,

13:53.967 --> 13:54.935
A CUSTOMER MAYBE?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.304
- YOU KNOW, THAT LOOKS
LIKE THIS BUSBOY WE HAD.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.873
GUY WAS KINDA OFF.
O.C.D., I THINK.

13:59.907 --> 14:00.840
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.242
- NO ONE GOT THE GRILL
AS CLEAN AS HE DID.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.443
BROKE MY HEART TO FIRE HIM.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.145
- ANYTHING TO DO WITH J.L.?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.980
- I FIRED HIM AFTER SHE LEFT.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.282
LAST VALENTINE'S DAY,
A COUPLE COMES IN, BUZZED.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.084
THEY WERE GOING AT IT
IN THE BOOTH.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.020
HE "ACCIDENTALLY" POURS ICE
WATER ON THE GUY'S LAP.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.287
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.956
- WHAT WAS THIS BUSBOY'S NAME?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.958
- HOLDEN...SOMETHING.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.160
THE SON OF A BITCH FILED
FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.996
LET ME CHECK.
- THANK YOU.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.098
- SO SUSPECT'S NAME'S
HOLDEN MARCH.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.167
PARENTS DIVORCED,

14:27.200 --> 14:29.136
AND HOLDEN'S STEP-FATHER
IS A THOMAS ELDRIDGE,

14:29.169 --> 14:30.403
A VP AT A SOFTWARE COMPANY.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.505
MOTHER'S AN ADRIANA MARCH,
A NURSE.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.042
NOW, HOLDEN GREW UP
IN MANHATTAN,

14:35.075 --> 14:37.177
BUT MOVED OUT TO NYACK
AFTER HIS MOTHER'S RE-MARRIAGE.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.946
- FIN AND ROLLINS
ARE HEADED THERE NOW?

14:38.979 --> 14:40.180
- YEAH.
- AND HOLDEN'S NAME AND PHOTO

14:40.213 --> 14:41.681
DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
TO THE VICS?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.416
- J.L. COULDN'T PICK HIM
OUT OF A PHOTO ARRAY.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.551
NEITHER COULD GWEN.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.518
HALEY THINKS
HER LITTLE BROTHER

14:45.552 --> 14:48.588
MAY HAVE HAD A FRIEND
NAMED HOLDEN, BUT...

14:48.621 --> 14:49.722
- SERGEANT BENSON.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.392
- CHIEF DODDS, I DIDN'T
REALIZE THAT YOU WERE WAITING.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.161
- IF YOU'D BEEN HERE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO WAIT.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.195
- OF COURSE.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.330
THIS IS
DETECTIVE NICK AMARO.

14:57.364 --> 15:02.202
- YES. I SIGNED OFF ON
YOUR CONDITIONAL RETURN TO SVU.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.170
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.205
- SO WHERE ARE WE ON
THE PATTERN 13 RAPIST?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.108
- WE HAVE A SUSPECT--
HOLDEN MARCH.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.143
- HOW SOLID?
ANYONE I.D. HIM?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.344
- WE'RE STILL CONNECTING
THE DOTS

15:11.378 --> 15:13.546
BETWEEN HOLDEN
AND THREE VICTIMS.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.148
- DOTS. YOU HAVE DOTS.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.149
WHERE IS HE?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.085
- WE'RE TRYING TO GET
UPDATED CELL CONTACTS.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.552
HE HAS NO SOCIAL MEDIA
PRESENCE.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.289
- THE RESTAURANT MANAGER GAVE US
HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.624
HIS PARENTS' HOUSE
IN NYACK.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.160
I HAVE TWO DETECTIVES
HEADED THERE NOW.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.229
WE DIDN'T WANT TO CALL
AND RISK TIPPING HIM OFF.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.097
- SO NO ONE'S MADE HIM,

15:30.130 --> 15:31.731
AND YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN TALKED TO HIM YET.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.300
- NO, SIR.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.702
- I NEED YOU AT COMPSTAT
TOMORROW TO GIVE THE UPDATE.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.405
WE HAVE A SERIAL ON THE
FRONT PAGE OF EVERY NEWSPAPER.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.706
SOLVE THIS, NOW.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.474
[cell phone rings]

15:41.508 --> 15:43.010
YEAH?

15:43.043 --> 15:46.413
- MAYBE SOMEBODY COULD HAVE
GIVEN ME A HEADS UP.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.185
- IS HOLDEN
IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?

15:52.219 --> 15:54.054
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR SON?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.656
- STEPSON.
AND IT WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.325
- HE DOESN'T LIVE HERE?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.993
- NOT FOR A FEW YEARS.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.329
WE RENT AN APARTMENT
FOR HIM IN MURRAY HILL NOW.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.496
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.632
- THOMAS, WHAT IS THIS?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.168
- NEW YORK DETECTIVES.
THEY'RE ASKING--

16:08.201 --> 16:10.237
- HOLDEN? WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE IS HE?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.471
- WE DON'T KNOW.

16:11.504 --> 16:15.542
HIS NAME JUST POPPED UP AS PART
OF A BROADER INVESTIGATION.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.077
HE MAY HAVE
WITNESSED SOMETHING,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.212
SO WE NEED TO CHECK
THE SCHOOLS HE WENT TO.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.448
- HE CHANGED SCHOOLS
SEVERAL TIMES.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.350
HE GOT BULLIED A LOT.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.585
I STILL THINK
THAT'S PART OF ALL HIS...

16:25.618 --> 16:27.687
- ALL HIS WHAT?
- HOLDEN IS HOLDEN.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.023
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING
CAUSED IT, ADRIANA.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.359
- HOLDEN IS HOLDEN?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.661
- HE MAY BE...ON THE SPECTRUM.

16:34.694 --> 16:35.662
- MAY BE?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.297
- THERE'S NO ONE DIAGNOSIS.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.333
HE'S SMART,
BUT HE'S SOCIALLY AWKWARD.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.035
WE'VE HAD HIM IN THERAPY.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.471
HE SHOWS PROGRESS,
AND THEN NEW CHALLENGES SURFACE.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.773
- WHAT KIND OF THERAPY?
IS HE ON MEDICATION?

16:46.806 --> 16:49.309
- WHEN HE REMEMBERS
TO TAKE IT.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.312
HE'S LONELY, HE'S BRILLIANT,
AND NO ONE NOTICES.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.381
EVERYONE HAS IT EASY
EXCEPT HIM.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.249
- BUT LATELY,
HE'S BEEN DOING BETTER.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.086
HE GOT A NEW JOB
AS A BICYCLE MESSENGER.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.453
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO HIM.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.821
CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE HE WORKS,

17:01.854 --> 17:03.590
GIVE US
HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.158
- HE SAID HIS PHONE BROKE.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.726
HE HASN'T GOTTEN A NEW ONE.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.328
- HOW ABOUT THE ADDRESS
TO THAT APARTMENT?

17:08.361 --> 17:11.131
- THAT WE CAN GIVE YOU.
- GREAT.

17:11.164 --> 17:14.067
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY PICTURES
OF HIM AS A CHILD,

17:14.101 --> 17:16.403
THAT COULD REALLY HELP US
IN OUR INVESTIGATION.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.240
- HOLDEN MARCH?

17:20.273 --> 17:23.276
- YES. I AM HOLDEN MARCH.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.444
- CAN WE TALK TO YOU?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.213
- I JUST GOT A WALL STREET
TO MIDTOWN RUN,

17:26.246 --> 17:27.614
SO NOW IS NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.216
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
THIS'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.683
- IS THIS ABOUT MY NEIGHBORS?

17:30.717 --> 17:31.751
- YOUR NEIGHBORS?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.153
- THE ONES MAKING
ALL THE NOISE.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.821
YOU KNOW,
HAVING SEX ALL THE TIME.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.423
THE WHOLE BUILDING
CAN HEAR THEM.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.591
- WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT.
LET'S TALK INSIDE.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.193
- WELL, THEY'RE
NOT HOME RIGHT NOW.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.195
SHE HAS A JOB.
SHE DRESSES UP ALL FANCY,

17:42.229 --> 17:43.696
AND HE GETS TO SPEND
HIS DAYS AT THE GYM.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.632
- OKAY. WELL, HOW ABOUT
WE GO BACK UPSTAIRS,

17:45.665 --> 17:47.500
AND THEN YOU CAN GIVE US
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEM?

17:47.534 --> 17:49.836
- NOW? NO, SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.438
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
BEFORE YOU DO--

17:51.471 --> 17:53.873
- PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH
MY BICYCLE.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.176
- SORRY.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.610
- OKAY, HOLDEN,

17:57.644 --> 18:01.248
SO WE WERE JUST WONDERING
IF YOU KNOW A JEAN ASHER?

18:01.281 --> 18:02.882
MAYBE YOU CALLED HER J.L.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.152
- SHE WORKED
AT A RESTAURANT WITH ME

18:05.185 --> 18:06.486
BEFORE I QUIT.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.820
THE MANAGER WAS ABUSIVE.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.489
- OKAY.
WELL, SHE WAS ASSAULTED,

18:09.522 --> 18:11.758
AND WE'RE THINKING
THAT MAYBE IT WAS

18:11.791 --> 18:14.427
ONE OF THE RESTAURANT'S
CUSTOMERS THAT WAS INVOLVED.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.129
- WITH HER, WHO KNOWS?

18:16.163 --> 18:19.732
SHE FLIRTED A LOT
WITH UNSAVORY MEN AT THAT PLACE.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.136
DID SHE GIVE YOU MY NAME?
SHE REMEMBERED WHO I WAS?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.805
- NO, ACTUALLY,
IT WAS THE MANAGER.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.707
- OH. WELL, I HAVE TO GO.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.908
- ACTUALLY, HOLDEN,
WE'D LIKE YOU

18:28.941 --> 18:30.543
TO COME TO THE STATION
WITH US.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.778
- I TOLD YOU I CANNOT.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.480
DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT?
AM I UNDER ARREST?

18:33.513 --> 18:35.148
- WE JUST WANT TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.418
- IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.919
- HOLDEN MARCH HERE.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.889
I AM WITH THE NYPD.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.924
THEY ARE ILLEGALLY RESTRAINING
MY MOVEMENT

18:44.957 --> 18:45.958
AND PREVENTING ME
FROM GETTING TO MY JOB.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.560
- NO ONE'S PREVENTING YOU
FROM DOING ANYTHING.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.795
CAN WE JUST
TAKE A LOOK IN YOUR BAG?

18:48.828 --> 18:49.796
- THEY HAVE NO WARRANT,

18:49.829 --> 18:53.600
AND THEY ARE BULLYING ME
AND VIOLATING MY RIGHTS.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.302
[bystanders shouting]
- HOLDEN, HOLDEN.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.337
WE'RE GOING TO CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER, OKAY?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.738
NICK?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.507
CALL DIVISION.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.542
WE NEED
24-HOUR SURVEILLANCE ON HIM

19:02.575 --> 19:04.511
UNTIL WE RULE HIM OUT.
- YEAH.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.216
- YOU THINK I WENT TO CAMP
WITH THE GUY WHO ATTACKED ME?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.484
- YEAH,
JUST TAKE A LOOK, OKAY?

19:14.721 --> 19:17.790
- OH, MY GOD. HIM?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.792
HOLDEN MARCH.
THAT'S THE GUY?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.295
- YEAH,
JUST ONE STEP AT A TIME.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.603
- IT'S HIM,
THE ONE WHO ATTACKED ME.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.872
I'M POSITIVE NOW.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.276
BUT WHY? I HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM SINCE I WAS 11.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.744
- WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT HIM?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.646
- JUST A SHY, SKINNY BOY.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.281
NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.550
ALL THE OTHER GUYS
WERE GOING THROUGH PUBERTY.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.285
THEY TEASED HIM.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.287
- THAT'S HIM.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.921
HOLDEN MARCH.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.557
I RECOGNIZE HIM NOW.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.659
HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
WITH MY BROTHER.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.527
- ANY REASON
HE'D BE ANGRY WITH YOU?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.529
- HE ASKED ME
TO A DANCE ONCE.

19:56.563 --> 20:00.199
BUT HE WAS THIS SHRIMP.
I WAS DATING A FOOTBALL PLAYER.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.672
A BLACK GUY.
THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.874
- HOW OLD WERE YOU, 15?

20:07.907 --> 20:11.911
- IS THAT WHY HE STABBED ME
15 TIMES?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.380
- YOU SAID HIS NAME IS HOLDEN?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.714
HE WORKED AT CATIGNANO?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.584
- MOSTLY IN THE KITCHEN.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.885
- IT COULD BE THE GUY
WHO CAME AT ME.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.921
I DON'T REMEMBER
HIM AT ALL.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.691
- HEY. SO THIS GUY IS
A BOO RADLEY.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.958
WE HAD TO SHOW THE GIRLS
CHILDHOOD PICTURES

20:25.992 --> 20:27.994
BEFORE THEY COULD
EVEN START TO PLACE HIM.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.896
- BUT HE REMEMBERS EVERY SLIGHT
FROM GRADE SCHOOL ON.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.465
HE'S AN ACCUMULATOR,
AN INJUSTICE COLLECTOR.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.767
- BACK UP.
DID THEY I.D. HIM?

20:34.801 --> 20:35.868
- TWO OUT OF THREE.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.737
- GREAT. PICK HIM UP.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.273
GET A WARRANT FOR THAT KNIFE
AND FOR THAT CELL PHONE.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.775
- OKAY, WE'RE ON IT.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.977
- SURVEILLANCE UNIT'S BEEN
OUTSIDE ALL DAY.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.379
THEY SAY.
HOLDEN NEVER CAME HOME.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.514
- WHAT ABOUT WORK?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.715
- HE DIDN'T
SHOW UP THERE, EITHER.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.049
- WHEN WERE THEY
GONNA TELL US THAT?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.485
- OKAY, WE'RE READY.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.355
HOLDEN MARCH. NYPD.
YOU IN THERE?

21:01.561 --> 21:03.896
- CLEAR!
- NOBODY MOVE.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.999
- HOLDEN!
- KITCHEN'S CLEAR.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.968
- WE'RE CLEAR.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.003
- BEDROOM'S CLEAR.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.772
- HE WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE NOISE

21:12.805 --> 21:15.007
THAT THE NEXT DOOR
NEIGHBORS MAKING.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.709
- POLICE!

21:22.615 --> 21:24.784
- WE GOT A BODY.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.322
- NICK, HE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF MANIFESTO HERE.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.757
LOOK AT THIS.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.593
- NOBODY HOME EXCEPT HER.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.994
- ROLLINS.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.900
THEY'RE EMPTY.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.735
- TWO DEAD.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.604
- HOLDEN HASN'T BEEN HERE
ALL DAY.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.739
THESE BODIES ARE IN RIGOR.
THEY'VE BEEN HERE A WHILE.

21:46.773 --> 21:47.940
- CALL A BUS.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.076
[walkie bloops]

21:50.109 --> 21:52.445
- WE GOT SOMETHING!

21:57.417 --> 21:59.452
- I FOUND THESE
IN THE RADIATOR.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.920
HE'S GOT AT LEAST TWO GUNS,
BRAND-NEW, OUT THE BOX,

22:00.953 --> 22:02.589
AND OVER 200 ROUNDS
OF AMMO.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.691
- AND THERE'S
ABOUT A 300-OR-SO-PAGE DOCUMENT,

22:04.724 --> 22:06.693
"NOW YOU KNOW,"
AND THE LAPTOP WAS OPEN.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.595
A BUNCH OF VIDEOS.
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.398
- HEY. HOLDEN MARCH HERE.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.600
ALL OF YOU STUCK-UP GIRLS

22:13.633 --> 22:16.736
WHO DATE ATHLETES
OR POPULAR FELLOWS

22:16.769 --> 22:19.872
AND PAY NO ATTENTION TO ME,
YOU SHOULD HAVE,

22:19.906 --> 22:22.609
BUT IT IS TOO LATE NOW.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.811
NONE OF YOU CAN HIDE FROM ME.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.548
I WILL BE COMING FOR YOU.

22:35.121 --> 22:35.622
.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.088
- HOLDEN MARCH, 23.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.525
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.792
IN THE PAST WEEK,

22:39.826 --> 22:42.094
HAS ASSAULTED THREE WOMEN
IN REVENGE ATTACKS

22:42.128 --> 22:43.830
AND THEN ESCALATED TO MURDER.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.164
- WE FOUND A MANIFESTO

22:45.197 --> 22:47.500
CONTAINING DOZENS
OF NAMES FROM HIS PAST,

22:47.534 --> 22:49.168
WHOM HE MIGHT BE TARGETING.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.471
- ALL HIS FORMER SCHOOLS
ARE ON LOCKDOWN.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.406
WE NEED UNITS FROM EACH
OF THOSE PRECINCTS

22:53.440 --> 22:54.874
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOLS.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.576
WE HAVE UNMARKED CARS
AT HIS RESIDENCE

22:56.609 --> 22:57.910
AND HIS
PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.647
- THE SUSPECT MAY BE ON FOOT
OR RIDING A BICYCLE.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.081
THE LAST ENCOUNTER
WE HAD WITH HIM,

23:02.114 --> 23:03.583
HIS AFFECT WAS RATIONAL.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.418
HE WAS ABLE TO MASK
FOR A SHORT TIME

23:05.452 --> 23:06.919
WHAT APPEARS TO BE
A PSYCHOTIC BREAK.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.489
- AND DON'T ASSUME THAT
HE WILL STICK TO HIS PATTERN.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.424
EVERYBODY WEAR YOUR VEST.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.759
DO NOT BE A HERO.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.463
ROLLINS, ANY LEADS
FROM HOLDEN'S SHRINK?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.064
- SHE SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE
ENOUGH ANGER

23:18.097 --> 23:18.931
TO COMMIT THESE ACTS.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.833
- SHE LEFT TOWN JUST IN CASE.
- YEAH.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.602
- WHAT ABOUT THE PARENTS?
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE?

23:22.635 --> 23:24.537
- ON THE WAY
IN FROM NYACK.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.105
- AS SOON AS THEY GET HERE,
SHOW THEM HOLDEN'S HIT LIST.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.040
SEE IF THEY'RE IN TOUCH
WITH ANY OF THESE PEOPLE.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.809
[cell phone rings]

23:29.842 --> 23:31.744
OH, UM...

23:31.778 --> 23:33.145
I'M SORRY,
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.847
- SERGEANT, A WORD.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.616
DETECTIVE, YOU, TOO.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.085
- DR. LEE.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.521
YES, I SEE.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.655
UM...

23:42.689 --> 23:44.491
OKAY.

23:44.524 --> 23:45.792
UM...

23:45.825 --> 23:48.595
MAY I CALL YOU BACK
IN A FEW MOMENTS?

23:48.628 --> 23:50.597
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. LEE.

23:50.630 --> 23:51.864
- ARE WE READY?

23:55.502 --> 23:58.004
- I'M ON IT, CHIEF.
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.509
- YOU TWO HAD HIM YESTERDAY,
AND YOU LET HIM GO?

24:02.542 --> 24:04.811
- 'CAUSE AT THAT TIME,
NOBODY HAD I.D.'d HIM YET.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.212
HE WAS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

24:06.245 --> 24:08.515
THAT WE COULDN'T COMPEL HIM
TO COME IN,

24:08.548 --> 24:10.617
AND THERE WASN'T
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AN ARREST.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.784
- YOU CREATE PROBABLE CAUSE.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.520
YOU PUSH HIM AROUND,
YOU PROVOKE HIM!

24:13.553 --> 24:15.922
- AFTER ERIC GARNER
AND THE STOP-AND-FRISK LAWSUITS,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.557
ONE-P-P'S BEEN VERY CLEAR.

24:17.590 --> 24:18.958
"DON'T MAKE A SCENE."

24:18.991 --> 24:20.927
- THEN WHY ARE YOU OPENING
YOUR MOUTH RIGHT NOW?

24:20.960 --> 24:24.130
- CHIEF, PLEASE,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

24:24.163 --> 24:26.232
WHEN WE SPOKE
TO THE SUSPECT,

24:26.265 --> 24:28.668
HE WAS IN COMPLETE CONTROL
OF HIMSELF,

24:28.701 --> 24:30.202
HE KNEW
HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS,

24:30.236 --> 24:32.939
AND I ORDERED
IMMEDIATELY FOR SURVEILLANCE.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.073
- WHICH DIDN'T MATTER,

24:34.106 --> 24:36.142
BECAUSE HE'D ALREADY MURDERED
HIS NEIGHBORS BY THEN.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.577
[cell phone rings]

24:37.610 --> 24:40.179
- I'M SORRY.
THIS IS A FAMILY EMERGENCY,

24:40.212 --> 24:41.213
AND I HAVE TO TAKE IT.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.650
- I'LL WAIT. AGAIN.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.552
- UH, MISS JACKSON.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.786
YES, HOW ARE YOU?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.589
YES, I KNOW.
I JUST SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.691
UM, HOLD A SECOND?

24:51.724 --> 24:53.926
I'M SORRY.
I NEED A MINUTE, PLEASE.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.605
MISS JACKSON, YES.
SO SORRY.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.907
- [on phone] THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE SORRY ABOUT.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.643
I'M IN THE HOSPITAL
WHERE YOUR FOSTER CHILD

25:10.677 --> 25:13.079
IS IN A STEP-DOWN UNIT
WITH A BABYSITTER.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.981
- YES, I KNOW.
I WAS THERE ALL NIGHT,

25:15.014 --> 25:17.249
AND MRS. AMARO
IS NOT A SITTER.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.885
SHE'S ACTUALLY
A FAMILY FRIEND.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.087
AND I JUST SPOKE TO
NOAH'S DOCTOR.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.755
- SO DID I.

25:22.789 --> 25:25.658
SHE CALLED ME AFTER FINDING
THE CHILD'S FRACTURED RIBS.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.695
- YES. THEN YOU KNOW
THAT THOSE INJURIES

25:28.728 --> 25:30.797
HAPPENED BEFORE
I TOOK CUSTODY OF NOAH,

25:30.830 --> 25:32.264
AND THAT THEY'VE HEALED NOW.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.034
- I'M NOT SUGGESTING
THAT YOU CAUSED THE INJURIES.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.970
I AM TROUBLED THAT YOU CHOSE
TO GO TO WORK

25:38.004 --> 25:40.106
WHILE YOUR FOSTER CHILD
REMAINED IN THE HOSPITAL.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.841
- I WAS CALLED AWAY
FOR AN EMERGENCY,

25:41.874 --> 25:43.843
AND I'M DOING EVERYTHING
THAT I CAN TO GET BACK THERE

25:43.876 --> 25:46.112
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,
BELIEVE ME.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.714
- I HOPE SO.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.682
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
THAT YOUR ABSENCE

25:49.716 --> 25:51.317
WILL BE INCLUDED IN MY REPORT.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.719
- YEAH, I DO.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.731
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

26:04.764 --> 26:06.633
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.167
- THE PARENTS ARE HERE.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.176
- CARLA AND BILL FRANKS.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.611
THEY WERE FRIENDS OF OURS
FROM CHURCH.

26:18.645 --> 26:19.846
- OKAY,
DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS?

26:19.879 --> 26:21.848
- UH, THEY MOVED TO FLORIDA
YEARS AGO.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.716
- WHAT IN GOD'S NAME WOULD
HE HAVE AGAINST THE FRANKS?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.317
- HE'S LOST IT, THOMAS.

26:25.351 --> 26:27.219
HURTING THOSE GIRLS,
THE PEOPLE HE'S KILLED.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.855
I SHOULD REACH
OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.256
- THEY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR FROM US.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.758
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.893

NOT A VERY GOOD TEACHER,
THOUGH.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.784
- ROLLINS, YOU AND AMARO

HIS LOVE OF WRITING.

28:09.889 --> 28:11.457
THAT YOU BETRAYED HIM.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.359

POLITE,

35:35.467 --> 35:40.672
THE KIND THAT WILL
HOLD THE DOOR OPEN FOR YOU.

35:40.706 --> 35:44.243
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MACHO.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.545
- THESE GIRLS THINK YOU DO.
- [whimpering]

35:46.578 --> 35:48.880
- WOMEN DON'T.

35:48.914 --> 35:52.851
THERE ARE THINGS
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.222
ADULT THINGS.

35:56.255 --> 35:59.658
NOT IN FRONT
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.330
PRIVATE THINGS,
YOU KNOW, JUST...

36:04.363 --> 36:06.698
JUST FOR YOU.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.540
OKAY?

36:14.573 --> 36:16.742
I SEE THE POTENTIAL
IN YOU, HOLDEN.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.415
I SEE HOW POWERFUL YOU ARE.

36:25.351 --> 36:26.618
- DO YOU?

36:26.652 --> 36:29.355
[dramatic music]

36:39.231 --> 36:39.431
.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.065
- HE'S GOT THE GUN ON ROLLINS.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.901
- WHERE ARE THE STUDENTS?
- HE MOVED THEM OFF CAMERA.

36:42.934 --> 36:43.702
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET ANOTHER ANGLE.

36:43.735 --> 36:44.870
- FAST. WE NEED
TO TAKE OUR SHOT.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.272
- HOLD UP.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.639
IF YOU MISS,
OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL IN THERE.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.541
- COMING OUT!
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

36:49.575 --> 36:50.676
- NICK!

36:54.846 --> 36:57.416
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHY DID HE LET YOU GO?

36:57.449 --> 36:59.585
- HE WANTED TO BE ALONE
WITH ROLLINS.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.588
[suspenseful music]

37:02.621 --> 37:06.858
*

37:09.027 --> 37:10.862
- I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.433
NICK IS THE KIND OF BOY
THAT I USED TO LIKE.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.302
YEAH, I FELL
FOR THE QUARTERBACK,

37:16.335 --> 37:18.670
THE GUYS WITH THE BIG SHOULDERS
AND THE BIG SMILES.

37:18.704 --> 37:21.540
THEY TOLD ME
THAT I WAS SPECIAL,

37:21.573 --> 37:23.775
BUT THEY JUST
WANTED TO USE ME.

37:23.809 --> 37:26.545
YOU KNOW WHAT, HOLDEN,
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.979
I WENT BACK TO MY HIGH SCHOOL
FOR A REUNION,

37:28.013 --> 37:29.648
AND EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.817
THE STAR ATHLETES, THEY'RE
JUST FAT AND SWEATY NOW.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.820
THEY'RE WITH BIG, UGLY WOMEN
THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.788
IT'S THE INTELLIGENT GUYS,
THE SMART GUYS,

37:36.822 --> 37:39.024
THEY HAVE...
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.827
I MEAN, THEY'RE RICH,
THEY'VE GOT BEAUTIFUL WIVES.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.796
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE GUYS LIKE YOU.

37:44.830 --> 37:47.433
*

37:47.466 --> 37:51.570
THEY WERE INTELLIGENT,
SENSITIVE, CONSIDERATE.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.705
- I TRY TO BE.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.707
- I KNOW.

37:55.741 --> 37:59.345
I KNOW THAT.
I CAN SEE THAT IN YOU NOW.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.747
NOW THAT...

38:01.780 --> 38:02.781
I'M A WOMAN.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.056
AND I WISH WE WEREN'T
HERE RIGHT NOW.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.795
YEAH, I WISH WE'D MET
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

38:16.828 --> 38:21.767
I JUST DON'T WANT THIS
TO SOUND WRONG, HOLDEN, BUT...

38:24.370 --> 38:28.407
I THINK YOU'RE SUPERB.
I REALLY DO.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.677
- IT IS TOO LATE.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.781
- I READ YOUR MANIFESTO.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.555
- YOU DID?

38:44.856 --> 38:47.058
- MMM.
I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.695
HOLDEN, IT'S...

38:49.728 --> 38:51.963
IT'S BRILLIANT,
AND I JUST...

38:51.997 --> 38:54.766
I'M SO SORRY
THAT SOMEBODY LIKE YOU

38:54.800 --> 38:55.667
HAS HAD TO GO
THROUGH ALL THIS.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.035
YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS.

38:57.068 --> 38:59.037
YOU DESERVE TO BE ADORED,

38:59.070 --> 39:01.106
TO BE CARESSED, TO BE...

39:01.139 --> 39:03.409
UM...

39:03.442 --> 39:05.411
TO BE KISSED, YEAH.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.518
WOULD YOU LET ME KISS YOU?

39:22.794 --> 39:24.730
- HE'S LOWERING THE GUN.
GIVE THEM THE GREEN LIGHT.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.498
- SNIPER STILL DOESN'T
HAVE A CLEAR SHOT.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.634
HOLDEN HAS TO
GET CLOSER TO AMANDA.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.135
- WHY ISN'T SHE GETTING HIM
INTO RANGE?

39:30.168 --> 39:31.169
- JUST GIVE HER TIME.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.471
- SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.640
SHE'LL GET
HIM TO PUT THE GUN DOWN.

39:34.673 --> 39:38.710
- NOW, WHILE WE'RE HERE,
WHILE WE'RE ALONE,

39:38.744 --> 39:41.613
JUST LET ME KISS YOU.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.751
- I HAVE NEVER KISSED ANYONE.

39:45.784 --> 39:46.785
- GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

39:46.818 --> 39:49.087
I WON'T HURT YOU.
I PROMISE.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.689
IT'S GOING TO
BE ALL RIGHT, HOLDEN.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.065
IT ALL BEGINS WITH A KISS.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.705
[gunshot]
- AAH!

40:06.738 --> 40:08.574

MY SON! MY BABY!

40:17.549 --> 40:18.784
YOU SHOT MY SON!

40:18.817 --> 40:20.719

40:21.753 --> 40:22.721
- I'M SORRY.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.656

40:24.690 --> 40:27.158
- [sobbing]
- IT'S OKAY.

40:27.192 --> 40:30.729
- MY BABY!

40:30.762 --> 40:32.598
HE'S GONE.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.236
- AMANDA, HEY.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.237
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

- YEAH?

40:41.239 --> 40:43.475
- I HAD HIM.

40:43.509 --> 40:45.010
IT WAS...IT WAS DONE.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.745
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP THEM?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.779
- IT WASN'T OUR CALL,
ALL RIGHT?

40:47.813 --> 40:48.780
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

40:48.814 --> 40:51.016
- OKAY. OKAY.

40:51.049 --> 40:54.152
OKAY.

40:54.185 --> 40:55.654
I'M FINE.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.196
- YOU GAVE MOMMY A SCARE,
DIDN'T YOU, NOAH?

41:06.231 --> 41:08.834
BUT YOU'RE MY BIG BOY.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.803
YOU'RE MY LITTLE FIGHTER,
AREN'T YOU?

41:11.837 --> 41:13.839
YOU'RE SO STRONG.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.842
YOU HAD TO BE, HUH?

41:16.875 --> 41:19.277
YOU GOT A LONG LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

41:19.310 --> 41:23.248
YOU GOT PLACES TO SEE,
THINGS TO DO.

41:25.884 --> 41:30.556
AND PEOPLE
WHO WILL LOVE YOU.

41:30.589 --> 41:34.793
- ALL OF YOU BEAUTIFUL,
BLONDE, UNOBTAINABLE GIRLS,

41:34.826 --> 41:37.195
I FORGIVE YOU.

41:37.228 --> 41:41.166
IF IT WERE NOT FOR YOU,
I WOULD NOT BE HERE

41:41.199 --> 41:43.134
ON THE EDGE OF GREATNESS.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.838
I COULD HAVE SPENT
MY WHOLE LIFE IN THE SHADOWS,

41:46.872 --> 41:49.941
BUT I CHOOSE INSTEAD
TO FIGHT BACK,

41:49.975 --> 41:53.779
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE
REMEMBER ME,

41:53.812 --> 41:56.014
BECAUSE I KNOW ONE THING--

41:56.047 --> 41:59.184
IT IS BETTER TO DIE
IN INFAMY

41:59.217 --> 42:02.087
THAN TO LIVE
A LIFE OF OBSCURITY.
