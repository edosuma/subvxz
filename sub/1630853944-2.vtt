00:01.871 --> 00:02.741
<i>Previously,
on</i> Chesapeake Shores...

00:02.785 --> 00:03.699
You're back!

00:03.742 --> 00:05.962
I'm doing okay.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.137
Nell and Abby and I,
we can look after him.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.530
And me.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.487
- You're not gonna--
- Take the job at the Getty?

00:09.531 --> 00:10.532
How can I?

00:10.575 --> 00:12.012
That was my sister.

00:12.055 --> 00:14.057
<i>She's even more angry with Dad
than I am.</i>

00:14.101 --> 00:15.189
I like where this is going.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.842
- I do, too.
- Yeah?

00:16.886 --> 00:17.974
Mm-hmm.

00:18.018 --> 00:18.844
Hey, Dad.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.150
- Hey!

00:21.630 --> 00:23.066
<i>So I was just calling
to tell you</i>

00:23.110 --> 00:24.981
<i>that I think maybe
we should give us a try.</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:26.287
You do want to go on a date?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.853
Yes, I do.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.159
Did you give
Luke Tatum a promotion?

00:29.203 --> 00:30.813
<i>I did.
Why didn't you tell me</i>

00:30.856 --> 00:31.770
you were seeing him?

00:31.814 --> 00:32.989
Because he went to prison?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.686
Maybe.

00:34.730 --> 00:35.731
I think you're gonna
have to find some other work.

00:35.774 --> 00:36.993
I can keep things going

00:37.037 --> 00:38.212
at the office
for a little while.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.778
- Would you care to dance?
- I would.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.693
I don't want to rush this.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.086
We'll kiss when it's time,

00:43.130 --> 00:44.783
but not now.

00:49.136 --> 00:52.226
"As you wish!"

00:53.749 --> 00:55.838
I love this movie so much.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.492
Me too.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.885
Is this, like, the zillionth
time we've seen it?

00:59.929 --> 01:02.497
Well, I can't count that high,
but it's definitely up there.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.585
Hello!

01:03.628 --> 01:05.587
I heard laughter
and smelled popcorn.

01:05.630 --> 01:06.805
Aunt Bree, come join us!

01:06.849 --> 01:08.677
Oh, no,
I don't want to intru-- ooh!

01:08.720 --> 01:11.027
<i>Princess Bride?</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:12.376
Pull up a pillow.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.813
Okay. Oops. Excuse me.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.513
Oh. Mm! Good popcorn.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.644
I know.

01:19.688 --> 01:21.298
It's Caitlyn's
special secret recipe.

01:21.342 --> 01:22.734
She adds
a little touch of garlic salt.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.910
And a ton butter.

01:24.954 --> 01:27.348
I mean, if you're gonna
have popcorn, have popcorn.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.786
Hey! What's going on in here?

01:30.829 --> 01:33.354
Uh, impromptu
girls' movie night.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.791
Oo <i>Princess Bride.</i>
I love this film.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.662
Mm, well, it is pretty crowded
in here.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.925
Yes, but I brought ice cream.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.753
You know, there's always room
for one more.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.061
Here you go.

01:45.105 --> 01:45.975
Somebody press play!

02:55.958 --> 02:58.221
You know, eventually,
you gotta make a move.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.657
Mm-hmm.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.184
Like this one?

03:06.316 --> 03:07.578
I hate you.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.759
Listen, Connor...

03:14.803 --> 03:16.457
Sarah and I have been talking,

03:16.500 --> 03:17.762
and we're thinking

03:17.806 --> 03:19.895
that we should
postpone our Maui trip

03:19.938 --> 03:21.462
just until
you're fully recovered.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.550
What?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.073
That's ridiculous.

03:24.116 --> 03:26.728
I appreciate the sentiment,
but, come on, no way.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.686
Okay, well, then how about
just until you're back on--

03:28.730 --> 03:29.644
Kev, Kev.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.211
I'm getting better every day.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.517
And I mean, what would
you staying home do, really?

03:33.561 --> 03:36.520
I've got Gran, I've got Mom,
I've got Dad, I got Abby,

03:36.564 --> 03:37.826
I got Margaret,

03:37.869 --> 03:39.349
I got the nieces
taking care of me.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.221
Plus, you and Sarah,
you deserve to get away.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.223
Really.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.485
You're not just saying that

03:44.528 --> 03:46.487
because I've won
two straight games, are you?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.489
It's a bit of both.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.055
Oh,

03:50.099 --> 03:51.709
and, uh...

03:51.753 --> 03:53.494
- ...checkmate.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.235
Oh, now I really
want you to go.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.282
And I'm due
back to work anyways, so.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.805
Just...

04:00.849 --> 04:02.111
take it easy, okay?

04:03.068 --> 04:04.592
Yeah.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.550
Kicking my butt in chess
is really relaxing. <i>Thank you.</i>

04:11.555 --> 04:13.427
Hi there, O'Brien.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.732
Hello yourself.

04:14.776 --> 04:15.951
How you doing?

04:15.994 --> 04:18.345
Good. Little stressed.

04:18.388 --> 04:21.304
Yeah? You feeling ready
for the bar exam?

04:21.348 --> 04:23.088
Hopefully.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.874
Next Thursday and Friday
will be here before I know it.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.136
Well, if you brought
your index cards, I'll quiz you.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.833
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.444
Oh, I also want to tell you

04:30.487 --> 04:32.924
how much I appreciate
you not asking me

04:32.968 --> 04:34.056
how I am feeling.

04:34.099 --> 04:37.189
No problem.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.887
So how are you feeling?

04:40.018 --> 04:41.585
You do look better.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.717
Thank you.

04:42.760 --> 04:43.674
Yeah.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.894
'Kay, um...

04:45.937 --> 04:48.375
what is the definition
of criminal trespass?

04:48.418 --> 04:50.028
Um...

04:50.072 --> 04:53.031
the a <i>ctus reus</i> is entering
or remaining on property

04:53.075 --> 04:54.903
without authorization,

04:54.946 --> 04:56.121
and the <i>mens rea</i>

04:56.165 --> 04:58.123
is knowledge
it is without authorization.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.169
Yeah, you got it.
That's really good.

05:01.649 --> 05:04.086
Well, I hope this doesn't count
as criminal trespass.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.348
Hello, Margaret.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.045
Hi, Megan.
Always good to see you.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.613
Mm. Sorry to interrupt
your studying,

05:09.657 --> 05:11.223
but it is time, Connor.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.399
Hmm.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.791
Doctor's orders.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.707
Diet is very important
for his recovery.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.362
You need your vitamins
and protein.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.016
Here is your kale smoothie.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.236
Yummy.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.064
Mm. Would you like one?

05:26.108 --> 05:27.718
If it's not too much trouble.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.285
Not at all.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.288
Ahem?

05:40.644 --> 05:42.037
Thattaboy.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.824
I don't care
how healthy it is...

05:46.868 --> 05:49.871
still tastes like fresh-cut
grass through a blender.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.440
Oh! Now I can't wait.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.312
So...

05:56.356 --> 05:58.488
the big second date
with Evan, hmm?

05:58.532 --> 05:59.576
Mm-hmm.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.795
Second dates
are very important.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.883
No pressure.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.841
I know. Thank you.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.408
And I get to pick what we do.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.062
- Well, that's nice.
- Freedom of choice.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.890
Yes, except that
I have too much choice,

06:08.933 --> 06:10.065
and I cannot make a decision.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.632
Oh, yeah, I can relate to that.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.242
That's me
just trying to order coffee.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.418
Oh, great,
so you two have no advice.

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
Of course we have advice.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.769
We have tons.

06:18.813 --> 06:19.770
Now, you have
to consider the source, though,

06:19.814 --> 06:20.989
'cause I think,
out of all of us,

06:21.032 --> 06:22.338
I'm the one
who's dated the most here--

06:22.382 --> 06:24.819
not something
I'm necessarily proud of,

06:24.862 --> 06:27.430
but, hands down, best
second date I've ever been on

06:27.474 --> 06:28.518
was at a carnival.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.520
You dated a carny?

06:30.564 --> 06:33.001
No! I went <i>on</i> a second date <i>
to</i> a carnival.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.437
- Are you even listening?
- Sort of.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.265
Well, a carnival
sounds interesting.

06:36.308 --> 06:38.180
- Who did you go with?
- Peter.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.790
Remember the musician?
He had a big beard.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.052
Played in a rock band?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.184
Oh, yeah.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.707
Dad hated him!

06:43.751 --> 06:44.882
Oh, yeah.
He had reason to.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.320
Anyway, we went,
and it was a blast.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.888
You know?
Roller coasters, Ferris wheel.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.324
Big funhouse mirrors...

06:52.368 --> 06:53.761
you kinda can't help
but let down all your defenses

06:53.804 --> 06:54.718
and we were just like kids.

06:54.762 --> 06:55.806
Hmm.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.939
Well, Evan would like that.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.506
Maybe a little too much.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.463
Oh.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.508
You know what? No.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.423
This is my decision,
it's my choice.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.555
The best date
David and I ever went on

07:05.599 --> 07:06.817
was a picnic on the beach.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.167
Aw, that's romantic.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.734
Yeah, it was,
until he got food poisoning.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.257
Bad clams.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.303
How is that the best date?

07:14.346 --> 07:16.740
Because, for two days after,
I got to take care of him,

07:16.784 --> 07:18.046
and we got super-close.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.440
And plus,
once you hold a wastebasket

07:20.483 --> 07:22.267
for someone to be sick in...

07:22.311 --> 07:24.313
the walls come down.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.228
Well, there you go, Abby--
just feed Evan some bad clams,

07:26.271 --> 07:28.230
and, bam!
Romance.

07:28.273 --> 07:32.277
Great. You know, I love you two
more than anything,

07:32.321 --> 07:34.889
but I have changed my mind--
please, no more advice.

07:34.932 --> 07:38.980
Okay, so I... can't find
a carnival anywhere nearby,

07:39.023 --> 07:40.372
but I can find a snake farm
that's--

07:40.416 --> 07:41.852
- Oh!
- ...only 70 miles from here.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.029
And that could be
unique and fun!

07:45.073 --> 07:46.509
Wow, that's a lot of snakes.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.164
Ooh. Yeah.
Yelp reviews seem mixed.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.781
Well...

07:57.825 --> 08:00.654
it was definitely
not my finest moment,

08:00.697 --> 08:03.178
but sure, I remember
the bad clams at the beach.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.049
You were so cute
and vulnerable!

08:05.093 --> 08:06.268
Cute and dehydrated.

08:06.311 --> 08:10.054
But you did take
such good care of me.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.926
- Mm.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.365
- Mom?

08:16.408 --> 08:17.932
David, Jess...

08:17.975 --> 08:19.716
I hope you don't mind.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.110
I'm so sorry to show up
like this,

08:22.153 --> 08:24.591
but I just had to get
out of Boston.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.679
No, it's fine.

08:25.722 --> 08:26.897
Yeah, but why
didn't you call us?

08:26.941 --> 08:28.203
We would've picked you up
at the airport.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.900
Yeah, it was
a last-minute decision.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.163
I had to make sure
I wasn't being followed.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.252
Followed?

08:34.296 --> 08:36.864
It's horrible.
It's so horrible, David.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.996
I mean, the press,

08:39.040 --> 08:40.432
they just won't leave me alone.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.610
And the FBI...
I mean, they're the worst.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.437
They keep on asking me

08:45.481 --> 08:47.396
the same questions
over and over and over.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.833
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mom.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.836
My so-called friends
want nothing to do with me.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.231
I mean,
Helen Coolidge hung up on me.

08:56.274 --> 08:57.885
Helen Coolidge!

08:57.928 --> 08:59.364
I've known her for 40 years!

09:00.931 --> 09:03.586
Why would your father
do something like this to us?

09:11.681 --> 09:13.117
I can't sleep.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.902
I can't eat.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.339
I keep going over in my mind

09:17.382 --> 09:19.863
if your father said anything...

09:19.907 --> 09:23.388
anything that might give us
a clue as to where he went.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.522
But... he just left.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.742
I know, Mom.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.573
Can I get you anything?

09:35.618 --> 09:38.186
Some more water or...?

09:38.229 --> 09:40.014
No, thanks, Jess.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.060
Actually...

09:43.104 --> 09:44.671
you could fill this up
with gin and tonic,

09:44.714 --> 09:45.889
if you have any.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.587
Uh, Mom...

09:47.630 --> 09:49.676
I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

09:49.719 --> 09:50.938
Why not?

09:52.113 --> 09:53.897
We are ruined, David.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.778
Mm. Thank you
for having me over for brunch.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.867
This is excellent oatmeal.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.782
Well, I do make
a good bowl of porridge.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.785
Or wait, is oatmeal
and porridge the same thing?

10:11.828 --> 10:15.484
Well, actually, um,
oatmeal is a type of porridge,

10:15.527 --> 10:18.356
but not all porridge
has oats.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.315
You know,
the best porridge I've ever had

10:20.358 --> 10:22.230
was the Filipino type,

10:22.273 --> 10:23.535
"champorado,"

10:23.579 --> 10:26.669
made from corn, milk,
sugar, and chocolate.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.758
How do you know all this?

10:28.802 --> 10:30.107
Like I said,

10:30.151 --> 10:31.979
I think I read everything
in the prison library,

10:32.022 --> 10:33.458
including cookbooks.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.895
Okay.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.679
If I didn't keep myself busy,
I would've lost my mind.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.377
You're very impressive.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.468
Nah, I don't know about that.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.775
You know, but I do make a great
Trivial Pursuit partner.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.559
Ooh! You are gonna have to be
my partner,

10:47.603 --> 10:49.257
and we will play
my entire family.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.693
Actually, on second thought,
that's a terrible idea.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.086
They are crazy competitive.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.958
Okay, well,
I'm also good Scrabble.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.438
Me too.

10:56.481 --> 10:57.526
We should play that sometime.

10:57.569 --> 10:59.136
Okay. I'm in.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.399
Um...

11:01.443 --> 11:03.837
I have a question for you.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.796
How would you feel about...

11:06.840 --> 11:09.494
reading my new short story?

11:10.931 --> 11:12.149
Yeah, I'd be honored.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.585
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.197
'Cause I feel like
your opinion would matter a lot

11:16.240 --> 11:18.808
as it is set in prison.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.419
- Oh.
- Yeah.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.336
I tend to get inspired
by new things.

11:26.511 --> 11:27.948
Like me?

11:29.166 --> 11:30.690
Kinda.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.954
Um, anyway, this one just
kind of popped into my head,

11:33.997 --> 11:36.478
and it's a story
about redemption,

11:36.521 --> 11:37.784
and I would love
to get your feedback on it.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.351
Yeah, sure.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.658
Great. Thank you.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.573
Yeah.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.403
Uh, where are you going?

11:48.446 --> 11:50.013
Oh, I've learned not to watch
people read my stuff.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.493
It's better this way.
Enjoy!

11:51.536 --> 11:54.235
Uh...

11:57.499 --> 12:00.502
Hey, Carter. How's L.A.?

12:00.545 --> 12:02.417
Yeah, well,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.680
it's great to know that
the Getty offer still stands,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.377
but--

12:06.421 --> 12:08.075
what?

12:08.118 --> 12:09.990
I told you,
things have changed here.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.861
You know my son
had a heart attack.

12:11.905 --> 12:13.820
We're lucky he's alive.

12:13.863 --> 12:18.781
So, Carter, really,
thanks, but no thanks.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.478
I am needed here.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.744
Yeah, and I appreciate that,
but I--

12:26.833 --> 12:28.660
You know, I-- I gotta run,

12:28.704 --> 12:30.880
so we'll talk later, okay?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.839
Yeah. Bye.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.800
So...

12:37.844 --> 12:40.237
how much of that did you hear?

12:40.281 --> 12:42.500
- Enough.
- Ah-hah.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.416
Did you just turn down
a job at the Getty?

12:45.460 --> 12:46.635
Yeah, I guess I did.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.376
Why?

12:48.419 --> 12:50.204
Honey, I can't leave you
right now.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.814
Yes, you can.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.250
You talked to the cardiologist.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.817
She says
that I'm doing great,

12:54.861 --> 12:55.905
I'm getting better every day.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.386
Yeah.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.822
Mom, come here.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.132
I don't want you
turning down this job--

13:05.175 --> 13:07.264
this amazing job--

13:07.308 --> 13:08.570
because of me.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.398
I appreciate that.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.356
I do.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.272
But I've made up my mind.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.326
Oh. Are you finished?

13:25.369 --> 13:26.762
Yep. Yeah, it's...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.111
it's good, Bree.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.026
It's really good.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.201
I like it.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.552
Nice job.

13:34.596 --> 13:37.120
Well, good, thank you.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.818
No, but you can--

13:38.861 --> 13:41.690
I mean, I asked you--
for you to be honest,

13:41.733 --> 13:44.911
so you can, you know, give me--
give me your honest criticism.

13:44.954 --> 13:45.955
You know, be brutal.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.958
Okay. Um...

13:49.002 --> 13:50.830
you didn't quite capture it.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.746
Huh.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.924
I mean,
it's-it's well-written.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.404
It just, um...

14:00.448 --> 14:01.405
it doesn't really ring true.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.018
Hmm.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.454
You see...

14:06.497 --> 14:08.064
the thing about prison--

14:08.108 --> 14:11.285
it's... it's a mixture of, uh,

14:11.328 --> 14:13.853
terror and boredom.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.507
And, um...

14:16.551 --> 14:19.336
this is like someone looking
from the outside in.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.993
Okay, 'kay.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.647
Mm-hmm.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.257
You're not mad at me,
are you?

14:27.301 --> 14:29.869
No! No, no, no, no. No.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.000
Not mad, just--

14:31.044 --> 14:33.002
I asked
for your honest opinion, so,

14:33.046 --> 14:35.178
I don't want false praise...

14:36.571 --> 14:38.616
Just a little praise
would be nice, though.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.183
It's-- It's really good.

14:40.227 --> 14:43.056
It's just...
it's just not accurate.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.363
Okay.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.887
Thank you.

14:51.673 --> 14:54.110
So, do you wanna, I don't know,
watch a movie or something?

14:54.154 --> 14:56.112
Sure, yeah.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.984
Okay.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.466
So what exactly about it
is not accurate?

15:04.207 --> 15:05.513
You know, like,
forget I said anything--

15:05.556 --> 15:07.123
it's-it's fine.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.995
It's not fine.
Clearly, it's not fine.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.823
And, you know, I want to be
a professional about this,

15:11.867 --> 15:13.129
I want to make it better,

15:13.173 --> 15:15.044
so why don't we just
start from the beginning?

15:15.088 --> 15:16.611
You know, sit.
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sir.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.308
I'll read it from the top.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.788
From the top.
We'll go through it.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.443
Okay, well,
there isn't much, really.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.966
Okay, good.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.316
"It was
a gray Sunday morning--"

15:26.360 --> 15:27.796
Okay, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

15:27.839 --> 15:31.017
Um, see, in prison,

15:31.060 --> 15:33.106
very few cells have windows--

15:33.149 --> 15:35.151
like, mine didn't--

15:35.195 --> 15:37.893
and you can't see
what the weather's like, so.

15:39.025 --> 15:42.115
Okay. Noted.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.334
"My cellmate was just getting
out of his bunk when--"

15:44.378 --> 15:46.771
Yeah, and, um,
nobody says "cellmate".

15:46.815 --> 15:47.816
We say "cellie".

15:47.859 --> 15:49.383
"Cellie"? Really?

15:49.426 --> 15:51.602
Yeah.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.736
Okay. This is good.
Let's keep going!

15:54.779 --> 15:57.043
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm!

16:05.616 --> 16:06.922
Well, if we still
have that suitcase,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.489
it would be in here.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.751
Yeah, the big brown one
with wheels.

16:09.794 --> 16:13.711
Yeah. So, you and Sarah
excited about Maui?

16:13.755 --> 16:16.149
Yeah, it'll be good
for us to get away.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.629
Like you said--
"make some memories."

16:18.673 --> 16:20.022
Hey! Wow!

16:20.066 --> 16:21.197
You really do listen to me.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.504
Sometimes.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.854
Oh, here you are.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.943
Man, look at this place.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.684
How you feeling?

16:29.727 --> 16:31.033
Good. Whoa! You remember this?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.121
Of course!

16:32.165 --> 16:33.383
Taught you to curse,
playing this.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.689
Sweet story.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.387
I swear, that suitcase
is in here somewhere.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.389
- He shoots, he scores!

16:39.433 --> 16:40.912
Fine,
but I still beat you at chess.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.914
Hey, why doesn't
one of you win

16:42.958 --> 16:44.525
at finding
the brown suitcase, okay?

16:45.830 --> 16:47.354
This one right here?

16:47.397 --> 16:48.703
No.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.140
- That one with the wheels?
- Yeah.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.576
Hey, Dad?

16:52.620 --> 16:56.928
Mom mentioned
that she wants to stay here

16:56.972 --> 16:58.974
instead of taking
the job at the Getty.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.062
Yeah.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.499
How do you feel about that?

17:02.543 --> 17:04.675
Well, I feel a lot of things,
but it's her decision.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.720
You know?

17:05.763 --> 17:08.462
Hey-ey-ey!

17:08.505 --> 17:10.855
You remember how much
Jess loved this thing?

17:10.899 --> 17:13.423
I always thought that
Captain Carrot was super-creepy.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.773
Yeah, but, Dad, if she gives up
this opportunity because of me,

17:15.817 --> 17:17.558
I'm gonna feel guilty.

17:17.601 --> 17:18.907
Well, it's not just that.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.258
She's also hesitant
because of our... situation.

17:22.302 --> 17:25.261
You know, here we were, ready
to travel around the world,

17:25.305 --> 17:26.915
and this dream job
drops in her lap,

17:26.958 --> 17:28.482
and then you have
a heart attack.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.571
That's a lot to take in.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.094
Yeah. Well, you know
what they say--

17:32.138 --> 17:34.531
"if you want to make God laugh,
just tell him your plan."

17:34.575 --> 17:35.967
That's the truth!

17:36.011 --> 17:39.188
Anyway, it's a big decision
for your mother to make,

17:39.232 --> 17:41.451
and I'll support her,
whatever she decides.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.671
Ah-hah!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.803
Success!

17:45.847 --> 17:47.805
Maui, here we come.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.808
Man, there's a lot of junk
in here.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.115
One man's junk
is another man's treasure.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
Have you never heard
of a garage sale?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.901
What would I sell?
This is my stuff!

17:56.945 --> 17:59.208
You know what, you could
start with this thing.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.036
Aww, he was so cute.
Look at him, isn't he cute?

18:02.559 --> 18:04.909
Oh! Gosh! Creepy.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.567
This is from the Smithsonian.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.569
Looks like
they've identified the ship.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.964
It's the <i>Sapphire,</i>
out of Harwich, England.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.835
<i>Sapphire.</i>

18:17.879 --> 18:19.837
I don't know
if I like that name.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.970
Wow. It was built in 1675.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.754
No. On second thought,
I love that name.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.147
<i>Sapphire!</i>

18:25.191 --> 18:26.322
Who wouldn't love that?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.673
Hey, these museum blueprints
are outstanding.

18:29.717 --> 18:30.805
I agree.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.676
You were right
about hiring Murakami.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.330
She's an excellent architect.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.245
Thank you.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.682
Since I'm on such a roll,

18:38.726 --> 18:40.249
do you think
we could switch gears

18:40.293 --> 18:41.903
and discuss our second date?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.861
Absolutely.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.996
Okay. So...

18:48.039 --> 18:49.302
I would like to go

18:49.345 --> 18:50.694
to a jazz club
in Baltimore.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.743
Oh! You're serious?

18:55.786 --> 18:57.614
Uh, what?
You don't like jazz?

18:58.789 --> 19:01.183
I like jazz.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.185
I can't lie. I hate jazz.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.492
It sounds like fingernails
on a chalkboard.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.363
Oh! Okay.
So you really hate jazz.

19:07.407 --> 19:08.886
But you know what?
No, no, we'll go,

19:08.930 --> 19:10.323
and maybe this club
will change my mind.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.889
It'll be fun.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.195
Yeah, it doesn't sound like it.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.241
Seriously, let's go
and make a night of it.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.591
You know,
you took me on your yacht.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.723
Suppose I told you
I hate boats?

19:19.767 --> 19:20.855
Do you?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.770
No, but you didn't ask.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.163
You just took me on your boat.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.903
I should've just taken you
to a jazz club.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.514
And I would have
made the best of it.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.342
"Made the best of it"?

19:29.385 --> 19:31.779
Just what every woman
wants to hear.

19:35.304 --> 19:39.178
So, is it Colonel Mustard
in the kitchen with a knife?

19:40.483 --> 19:42.181
Yeah. You win.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.312
Wow.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.922
How about that?

19:44.966 --> 19:46.315
You're so good at this game,
Uncle Connor.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.360
Three in a row.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.970
Yep.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.712
Why do I get the impression
that you two are letting me win?

19:51.755 --> 19:53.322
- No!
- What do you mean?

19:53.366 --> 19:55.106
You don't have to be nice to me
just because I'm convalescing.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.978
Really?
Well, if that's the case,

19:57.021 --> 19:58.501
then we can play Monopoly tomorrow

19:58.545 --> 20:00.764
and I'm gonna destroy you.

20:00.808 --> 20:01.765
You're gonna destroy me?

20:01.809 --> 20:02.810
She will.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.899
Oh, if that's the case, then...

20:04.942 --> 20:05.943
...you're on.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.078
- Hey, girls.
- Hi!

20:10.121 --> 20:12.472
Oh! You'd better practice up!

20:12.515 --> 20:13.516
Okay.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.952
Hey there, O'Brien.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.172
Hello, Keller.
How goes it?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.695
I brought you
some office mail.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.131
Any bills?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.089
A few.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.656
Oh, goody.

20:22.699 --> 20:25.267
So, uh, do you want me
to quiz you for that bar exam?

20:25.311 --> 20:26.399
No, that's okay.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.487
I studied all last night.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.879
You sure?

20:28.923 --> 20:31.012
I think you're more nervous
about it than I am.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.275
I just want you to pass
with flying colors.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.146
I have no doubt that you will.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.713
Thanks.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.193
I must say,

20:38.237 --> 20:39.847
you're really
looking better, Connor.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.065
Thanks.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.763
Feeling better.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.156
Must be those kale smoothies.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.941
Let me ask your mom
to whip you up another one.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.030
- D-Don't you dare!
- No?

20:49.073 --> 20:50.379
Never thought I'd say this,
but let's get to the bills.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.911
This is great, Bree.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.173
Really?

21:02.217 --> 21:03.305
Yeah.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.786
It's so much better
than before.

21:06.874 --> 21:07.831
So moving.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.050
Ohh.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.575
You really captured it.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.490
Well, I mean, it's really
all because of you.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.536
Your notes
made all the difference.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.668
yeah, well, I'm glad being
in that damn place

21:18.712 --> 21:20.453
finally paid off somehow,
you know?

21:20.496 --> 21:22.063
Thank you so much.

21:22.106 --> 21:23.630
Anytime.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:23.673 --> 21:25.414
those beer cases aren't
gonna unload themselves.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.372
Right.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.242
I'll see you after work?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.330
I'd like that.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.724
Okay. Bye.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.161
- Hey, Daddy-o.
- Hi, honey.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.250
- See you later?
- Yeah.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.298
Hey, Luke.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.343
Oh, hey, Mick.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.041
Oh, hey, Harrelson called
and confirmed.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.653
Um, the next inspection's
gonna be on the 12th.

21:46.696 --> 21:47.741
Who?

21:48.959 --> 21:51.048
Harrelson,
the, uh, health inspector.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.354
Oh. Yeah.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.616
- Yeah.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.139
Hey!

21:56.402 --> 21:58.055
You okay?

21:58.099 --> 22:00.406
What? Yeah. I'm fine.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.280
Oh, and if you took a look

22:05.324 --> 22:06.629
at those job applications
I sent you,

22:06.673 --> 22:08.196
I was going to, um,

22:08.239 --> 22:10.459
I was gonna hire Alfonzo
to help out in the kitchen.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.504
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.027
Uh, uh, Alfonzo seems fine.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.942
You go ahead with that.

22:18.511 --> 22:19.468
Mick...

22:21.557 --> 22:22.689
I hope you don't think

22:22.732 --> 22:25.169
I'm out of line here
or anything, but...

22:25.213 --> 22:27.520
are you still taking
those prescription painkillers?

22:28.825 --> 22:30.087
What?

22:30.131 --> 22:32.046
Those pills?

22:32.089 --> 22:33.308
You still taking 'em?

22:36.267 --> 22:37.443
It's just you seem
a little bit off.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.837
All I'm saying is,

22:40.881 --> 22:43.797
that stuff can get away
from the best of us.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.930
You know, I--
Mick, I've been there.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.323
You know?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.064
For me, it was, uh,
it was alcohol.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.545
What are you insinuating?

22:54.285 --> 22:57.419
Mick, I apologize if I'm wrong
and you're just--

22:57.463 --> 22:59.203
You are wrong.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.640
Way wrong.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.121
Mick? Hey, Mick, come on.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.689
I didn't mean to upset you!

23:19.006 --> 23:20.921
All right, are you ready

23:20.964 --> 23:23.010
for a very adventurous
second date?

23:23.053 --> 23:24.664
Will you just tell me
what we're doing?

23:24.707 --> 23:26.230
- It's a surprise!
- Okay, let me guess.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.885
It's a jazz club on a yacht.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.583
Not even close.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.588
Wow.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.024
This is
a very picturesque place.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.462
Secluded.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.637
What's next?

23:41.681 --> 23:43.030
You'll see.

23:43.073 --> 23:45.075
I may need you to help me
with something, though.

23:46.642 --> 23:49.079
You're not gonna ask me
to help you dispose of a body,

23:49.123 --> 23:50.254
are you?

23:50.298 --> 23:51.604
Mm. Nope.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.478
Okay, what do we have here?

23:56.522 --> 23:58.175
Have you ever been crabbing?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.829
Crabbing?
Can't say that I have.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.178
Well, it's
a Maryland tradition,

24:01.222 --> 24:02.658
and some of the best crabbing
in the country

24:02.702 --> 24:04.181
is right here
in Chesapeake Shores.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.488
Well, I love seafood,
and crabs are my favorite.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.403
Great.
I grew up doing this.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.926
Dad taught us all
when we were kids,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.624
and I thought

24:11.667 --> 24:13.060
you might enjoy

24:13.103 --> 24:14.496
trying something new.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.063
I love trying new things.

24:16.106 --> 24:17.543
This is
a wonderful surprise, Abby.

24:17.586 --> 24:18.848
Good.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.589
I wasn't sure how you'd react,
because, well,

24:20.633 --> 24:22.504
I never know how you're gonna
react about anything.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.940
- But it's really fun.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.115
All right, do we take all this?

24:25.159 --> 24:27.727
Uh, it's gonna be a few trips.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.077
All right.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.557
Last one to the dock
is a jazz-lover.

24:35.343 --> 24:37.084
So the hand lines
are already out there,

24:37.127 --> 24:39.260
but I thought I would show you
how to toss a cage.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.304
Okay.

24:40.348 --> 24:41.871
First, we need our bait.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.264
Do you want to pass me
another turkey neck?

24:43.307 --> 24:44.961
Oh. My pleasure.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.267
Who would have ever thought

24:46.310 --> 24:47.834
"can you please get me
another turkey neck"

24:47.877 --> 24:49.400
would be said
on our second date?

24:49.444 --> 24:51.751
Makes you wildly anticipate
our third date.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.928
All right.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.103
There you go.

24:56.146 --> 24:57.060
Okay.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.541
Just let 'er rip?

24:59.585 --> 25:00.890
Yep.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.502
Huh?

25:03.545 --> 25:04.851
Don't forget your rope.

25:04.894 --> 25:05.982
Oh! Right.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.854
Check me out.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.725
Huh? I'm a fisherman!

25:11.597 --> 25:14.513
- No, you're a crabber.
-"Crabber." Right.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.607
Success!

25:21.650 --> 25:22.608
Crab legs!

25:25.349 --> 25:26.916
Hey, hey. Ah!

25:28.178 --> 25:29.571
Not funny.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.444
Evan, there's a little seal.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.403
Oh, wow!

25:46.501 --> 25:48.590
What a fun,
fantastic day.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.027
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

25:51.071 --> 25:53.421
It's one of
my favorite childhood memories.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.466
Thank you for sharing it
with me.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.817
My pleasure.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.255
You might just turn out
to be a darn good crabber.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.909
That is one of
the nicest things

26:02.952 --> 26:03.910
anyone has ever said to me.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
Cheers.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.537
Perfect.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.635
Hey, have you seen Mom
this morning?

26:33.679 --> 26:34.854
Do you know if she's up yet?

26:34.897 --> 26:36.420
Still asleep.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.772
She never sleeps this late.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.426
Well, can you blame her?
She's depressed.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.298
Let her sleep
as long as she wants.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.996
You have to be kidding me.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.694
What now?

26:48.737 --> 26:51.087
You thought
one distressed Peck was bad?

26:51.131 --> 26:53.220
Guess who just texted me
she's right outside.

26:55.570 --> 26:56.571
Hello?

26:57.616 --> 26:58.660
Sis!

26:58.704 --> 27:00.096
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

27:00.140 --> 27:01.228
I kind of didn't know myself,

27:01.271 --> 27:02.882
but I didn't have
much of a choice.

27:02.925 --> 27:04.274
- Hi, Jess.
- Hi!

27:05.536 --> 27:07.321
I hope that it's okay
I followed Mom here.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.801
Yeah, of course.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.194
Yeah, I think the...
Maple Room is open, maybe?

27:11.238 --> 27:12.674
I think so.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
Oh, I have inconvenienced you.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.677
No, no, no, no, no!

27:15.721 --> 27:16.678
I couldn't stay in Boston.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.419
The press is going crazy--

27:18.462 --> 27:19.681
going through our trash,
paying staff members,

27:19.725 --> 27:21.683
trying to get the dirt.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.729
That's disgusting.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.687
But enough of that.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.037
I am so sorry
that I missed the wedding.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.865
Can you ever forgive me?

27:29.909 --> 27:31.475
Of course, we understood.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.956
Rafiq needed me for
this big takeover in Dubai,

27:34.000 --> 27:35.697
and then
I got this weird stomach bug.

27:35.741 --> 27:36.742
Anyway, let me see the ring.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.700
Oh.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.963
Oh! It's so lovely.
Did you get my gift?

27:41.007 --> 27:42.312
- Yes. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.575
So where is mother?

27:44.619 --> 27:47.361
Behind closed doors?
Sobbing?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.755
Yeah. Pretty much.

27:49.798 --> 27:53.019
But what's going on with you
and all this adrenaline?

27:53.062 --> 27:54.585
When I talked to you
the other day,

27:54.629 --> 27:56.022
you seemed so exhausted.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.763
Mm. Well, it fluctuates.

27:57.806 --> 28:00.722
I go from pure rage,
to depression,

28:00.766 --> 28:02.724
to irony, to dark humor.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.117
Plus, I've had two espressos.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.988
I can see that.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.512
And how is Rafiq?

28:08.556 --> 28:11.385
Oh, he dumped me the second
he heard all about Dad.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.603
Oh, yikes.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.301
So, um...

28:14.344 --> 28:16.346
do you have anything stronger
than wine to drink around here?

28:22.831 --> 28:25.355
Here you go, Connor.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.183
Sorry, we're all out of kale.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.402
Yay.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.490
I'm getting more.

28:29.533 --> 28:31.144
Boo.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.321
But seriously, Mom,
thank you for taking care of me.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.279
Of course.
That's what mothers are for.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.284
Mm!

28:41.328 --> 28:42.677
What the heck is this?

28:42.721 --> 28:45.811
That is fresh
Irish sea moss tea.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.987
One of the healthiest things
you can drink.

28:48.030 --> 28:50.119
Not to be rude,
but this is probably

28:50.163 --> 28:51.773
the worst thing
I've ever tasted.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.385
Well,
the Irish have been drinking it

28:55.429 --> 28:56.735
for thousands of years.

28:56.778 --> 29:00.347
That contains 92 minerals,
including iron,

29:00.390 --> 29:02.349
that your body needs
to thrive.

29:02.392 --> 29:05.265
So, down the hatch. Hmm?

29:10.444 --> 29:12.185
You can really taste the iron.

29:12.228 --> 29:14.361
Yeah, it's a powerhouse tea, Connor.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.406
It's gonna boost
your energy levels.

29:16.450 --> 29:17.799
Hey!

29:17.843 --> 29:19.279
Oh...

29:19.322 --> 29:21.237
I really like Margaret.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.717
I do, too.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.110
She's going places,
you can tell.

29:25.372 --> 29:27.374
Oh, there's my phone.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.593
Drink the tea.
You're already looking stronger.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.727
Hi.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.512
So...?

29:35.556 --> 29:37.340
How'd the first part
of the bar exam go?

29:37.384 --> 29:38.515
Great.

29:38.559 --> 29:39.821
I think it went great.

29:39.865 --> 29:40.996
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.258
These were
the essay questions, right?

29:42.302 --> 29:43.477
Right.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.609
Yeah.
I remember struggling with them.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.786
But, hey, you survived
your first day.

29:47.829 --> 29:48.830
Congratulations.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.005
Thanks.

29:50.049 --> 29:51.441
And thanks
for all your help studying.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.054
So tomorrow is
multiple-choice questions?

29:55.097 --> 29:56.098
Yeah.

29:56.142 --> 29:58.100
And I feel ready.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.798
I really think--

29:59.841 --> 30:00.973
Yeah?

30:03.845 --> 30:05.238
What?

30:05.281 --> 30:07.501
What is that smell?

30:07.544 --> 30:09.024
Oh, that smell?

30:09.068 --> 30:11.200
That would be
my Irish sea moss tea.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.549
Mom made it for me.

30:12.593 --> 30:13.768
It's really good! Here.

30:13.812 --> 30:14.900
You want some?

30:14.943 --> 30:16.771
Hard pass.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.303
This was lovely.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.435
Thank you for this.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.263
You're welcome--

30:30.306 --> 30:31.873
Oh! They found us!

30:31.917 --> 30:33.875
Oh, this is a nightmare.

30:33.919 --> 30:36.008
Jess, Jess, please
close the drapes. Please hurry.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.491
Mr. Peck!
Just a few words! Please!

30:41.535 --> 30:43.885
Mr. Peck, please, we want
to hear your side of the story.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.931
So sorry, everyone.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.934
Um, just a slight problem,
and we are taking care of it.

30:48.977 --> 30:49.935
Promise.

30:54.678 --> 30:57.029
Hi. Connor? It's Jess.
We have a problem.

30:57.072 --> 31:00.423
Um, some of the press are here
and they're hounding the Pecks.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.164
They're banging on the door
and screaming questions at us

31:02.208 --> 31:03.600
and trying to take photos
through the windows.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.344
Enough!

31:08.388 --> 31:09.476
Are you sure?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.347
Okay, yeah.
I-I'll keep you posted.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.916
Um, Connor said
to call the police,

31:14.960 --> 31:16.135
that they're trespassing,

31:16.178 --> 31:17.745
and they can force them
off our property.

31:17.788 --> 31:18.702
Okay, but what are you--

31:18.746 --> 31:20.922
WMCS News--

31:20.966 --> 31:22.706
Okay, back up.
Back up.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.534
All right.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.971
I just spoke with our attorney,

31:26.014 --> 31:27.798
and he instructed us
that you all are trespassing

31:27.842 --> 31:29.278
and you need move
to the end of the driveway

31:29.322 --> 31:30.149
or you will be arrested.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.063
Who are you?

31:31.106 --> 31:33.065
Can we speak with the Pecks?

31:33.108 --> 31:34.457
I won't say it again.

31:34.501 --> 31:36.590
The police are on their way,
and you are trespassing.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.940
This is not only our business,
but it's also our home.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.289
Please respect that.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.943
And if you can't be respectful,

31:41.987 --> 31:43.466
then at least be mobile...

31:43.510 --> 31:45.251
...and get off my lawn!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.994
Go.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.526
Oh...

31:59.569 --> 32:00.962
There you go!

32:01.006 --> 32:02.268
Freedom.

32:02.311 --> 32:03.486
Thanks, Doc.

32:03.530 --> 32:04.618
Itchy, huh?

32:04.661 --> 32:05.967
Like crazy!

32:06.011 --> 32:08.230
Understandable,
but that's enough scratching.

32:08.274 --> 32:11.538
Put the arm in some warm water
for 20 minutes or so,

32:11.581 --> 32:13.235
that will soak off
the dry, flaky skin.

32:13.279 --> 32:14.889
- Got it.
- Don't scrub it.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.457
And you can apply lotion
for the next couple of days.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.241
- How's the family?
- They're good.

32:20.721 --> 32:21.765
Your Jess got married, huh?

32:21.809 --> 32:22.636
Yep.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.725
Congratulations.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.640
I hear
Connor's recuperating nicely.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.210
I play tennis with Dr. Yang.
You know how small towns are.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.907
Everyone knows
everybody's business.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.169
Yeah. Yeah.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.694
Okay, Mick,
you are good to go.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.435
Hey, uh, listen, I'm out of
that prescription you gave me.

32:39.479 --> 32:40.654
Can I get a refill?

32:40.697 --> 32:42.003
- The painkillers?
- Yeah.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.787
Nah, you'll be fine now.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.876
If there's any discomfort,
just take some ibuprofen.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.400
Really?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.793
Yeah, the x-rays show that
the break is completely healed.

32:49.837 --> 32:53.493
Besides, you don't want
to mess with opioids.

32:54.798 --> 32:57.888
I don't prescribe 'em unless
they're absolutely necessary.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.847
Okay. Understood.
Thanks, Doc.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.641
So, is it forks on the right?

33:11.685 --> 33:14.775
After all this time,
you still have to ask that?

33:14.818 --> 33:16.298
I only have
a limited amount of bandwidth

33:16.342 --> 33:17.299
for vital information.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.692
This is not vital.

33:18.735 --> 33:19.954
Forks go to the left
of the plate,

33:19.998 --> 33:21.738
and knives and spoons
go to the right.

33:21.782 --> 33:23.305
Knives always face inward,

33:23.349 --> 33:24.741
and if you're not serving soup,
you don't need a spoon.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.656
Oh. Hmm!

33:26.700 --> 33:27.570
I run a B-and-B.

33:27.614 --> 33:28.484
Do you?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.401
Uh, thanks for
your legal advice today, Connor.

33:32.445 --> 33:34.012
No problem.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.274
Trespassing is trespassing.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.405
The police show up?

33:36.449 --> 33:38.016
They did,

33:38.059 --> 33:39.887
and they're keeping the press
at the end of the driveway,

33:39.930 --> 33:41.410
but it's still total chaos.

33:41.454 --> 33:42.933
How's David's family
doing with all this?

33:42.977 --> 33:45.153
Uh, they're shell-shocked.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.677
It's nice to get away,
to be honest.

33:47.721 --> 33:48.939
Yeah, I can imagine.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.118
Hey, so how was
your second date with Evan?

33:53.161 --> 33:54.467
Yes, how was it?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.948
It was perfect.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.863
Aww. Did the snake farm
have a gift shop?

33:59.907 --> 34:01.648
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.998
You're looking good, brother.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.434
Got some color
back in your cheeks.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.871
Oh, thanks.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.308
Well, I'm glad

34:09.351 --> 34:11.223
that you could all make
this impromptu family meal

34:11.266 --> 34:13.181
because I really
want your help.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.704
It's about Mom.

34:14.748 --> 34:15.836
Of course.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.751
I'm concerned

34:17.794 --> 34:20.101
that she's turning down
the Getty job because of me.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.886
Well, Connor, look at it
from her perspective.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.975
If it was Carrie or Caitlyn,
God forbid,

34:25.019 --> 34:26.760
I wouldn't be
going anywhere just yet.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.979
No, I-I get it,

34:29.023 --> 34:30.981
but I'm an adult,
not a kid,

34:31.025 --> 34:33.549
and my EKG and CAT scans
are perfect.

34:33.593 --> 34:35.029
My doctors are very encouraged.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.726
Are you sure
you don't want her to go

34:36.770 --> 34:38.641
just 'cause she made you
drink Irish moss tea?

34:38.685 --> 34:41.557
Oh, she used to swear
by that stuff

34:41.601 --> 34:42.819
as a cure-all for everything--

34:42.863 --> 34:44.125
headaches, cramps, acne--

34:44.169 --> 34:45.561
she gave it to me
all the time in high school.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.955
I refused to drink it.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.175
Well, when she left the room,
I'd dump it on a potted plant.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.351
I have to say, though,
that plant lived for decades.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.138
Connor, I think
she should take the gig.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.705
But where does Dad stand
on all this?

34:58.748 --> 34:59.880
That's complicated.

34:59.923 --> 35:01.360
It is.

35:01.403 --> 35:02.839
Where is Dad?

35:02.883 --> 35:06.104
Uh, he is getting his cast off,

35:06.147 --> 35:08.193
but Kevin and I spoke to him
before he left for Hawaii,

35:08.236 --> 35:11.152
and Dad thinks
that Mom should consider it.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.414
Well, it is her dream job.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.939
Oh, sorry,
I just gotta take this.

35:15.983 --> 35:16.984
It's work.

35:17.027 --> 35:18.159
The timing sucks, though.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.422
Yeah, it really does.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.338
Oh, it's Dad.

35:23.382 --> 35:25.253
Hey, are you close?

35:25.297 --> 35:27.081
Yeah, why?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.127
<i>Did you not get my texts?
Everyone's coming for dinner.</i>

35:29.170 --> 35:30.258
Tonight?

35:30.302 --> 35:31.607
<i>Yes, tonight.</i>

35:31.651 --> 35:33.218
Are you okay?

35:33.261 --> 35:35.045
Yeah, I'm fine.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.917
Arm still hurts a little bit,
that's all.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.962
It'll, um, be great
to see everyone.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.878
Okay. Good.
Because we made Irish stew.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.446
<i>Hoo-hoo!
Now I'm really psyched.</i>

35:44.490 --> 35:45.969
I'm just pulling
into the driveway now.

35:46.013 --> 35:48.189
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and wash up what's leftover

35:48.233 --> 35:49.973
of this adhesive stuff
from the cast,

35:50.017 --> 35:51.714
and I'll meet you all
in the kitchen.

35:51.758 --> 35:54.021
Okay. Great.
See you in a minute.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.930
- Hey!
- How's it feel?

37:16.973 --> 37:19.367
Strange, itchy,
and a little stiff.

37:19.411 --> 37:21.239
Moisturizer is your friend.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.763
So I've heard. Ooh.
That stew smells sensational.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.330
Ah! Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut.

37:25.373 --> 37:26.809
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.290
So, Mom will be here momentarily.

37:29.334 --> 37:32.162
I'm hoping that we can
present a united front.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.512
Well, I'm all for
a united front,

37:33.555 --> 37:35.078
as long as we don't make her
feel ganged up on.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.341
Absolutely.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.038
I honestly don't know
how I feel about it.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.735
Mm, yeah, I mean, one minute,

37:39.779 --> 37:41.084
you guys are going on
a trip around the world,

37:41.128 --> 37:42.782
then she gets offered
the job at the Getty,

37:42.825 --> 37:44.653
then Connor gets sick...

37:44.697 --> 37:47.482
it's no wonder she wants
to stay close to home.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.180
Yeah, I mean, sometimes, life
has a cruel sense of humor--

37:50.224 --> 37:52.487
giving you what you want most
at the worst possible time.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.750
And what
is the worst possible time?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.361
Mom.

37:56.404 --> 37:58.145
I brought wine.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.713
Oh, boy, do I smell
Irish stew?

38:00.756 --> 38:02.236
You sure do.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.935
It's simmering on the stove.
Hope I didn't mess it up.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.328
Uh, come on, let's sit.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.721
Yeah, we can start
with the salad.

38:08.764 --> 38:09.504
Dad, can you grab
some wine glasses?

38:09.548 --> 38:10.375
Yeah.

38:10.418 --> 38:11.463
Does red go with stew?

38:11.506 --> 38:12.768
Oh, yeah, it does, indeed.

38:12.812 --> 38:14.553
There's already
Guinness in the stew,

38:14.596 --> 38:17.207
so you might as well bring
all the alcohol.

38:17.251 --> 38:19.471
Oh, this is such
a nice surprise, you guys.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.299
Well, we wanted to see you,

38:21.342 --> 38:23.997
and, well, Abby was motivated
to make the family stew,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.607
so it's a win/win.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.870
Uh, but I do want
to get to the point.

38:31.613 --> 38:34.355
We are so happy that you're in
Chesapeake Shores now

38:34.399 --> 38:35.443
and that you're part
of our lives again,

38:35.487 --> 38:37.619
and you and Dad
are back together.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.534
Oh, thank you, honey.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.320
Yeah, and we're so proud of you

38:42.363 --> 38:44.626
and all of the success
you've had with the art show.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.106
Yeah, seeing you

38:46.149 --> 38:47.847
and your skills in action
was really special.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.154
Okay, uh,

38:51.198 --> 38:53.896
why do I sense there is
an ulterior motive here?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.333
No, no, no.
No ulterior motive.

38:55.376 --> 38:58.466
It's just... we feel...

38:58.510 --> 39:00.773
uh, we feel--

39:00.816 --> 39:02.949
Uh, we are very...

39:02.992 --> 39:05.517
excited to have
this lovely family dinner,

39:05.560 --> 39:08.302
but we just want to say...

39:08.346 --> 39:10.043
We don't think
you should pass up

39:10.086 --> 39:11.566
the opportunity at the Getty.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.308
Uh-huh.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.266
Well, as you all know,

39:16.310 --> 39:18.268
things have changed a bit,

39:18.312 --> 39:19.705
and, Connor,

39:19.748 --> 39:21.707
your health
means everything to me.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.404
And I appreciate that--

39:23.448 --> 39:24.405
everything
that you've done for me,

39:24.449 --> 39:25.537
but, I mean,

39:25.580 --> 39:27.408
you gotta know
that the O'Brien team,

39:27.452 --> 39:28.366
they got me covered.

39:28.409 --> 39:29.454
We do.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.325
Plus,
I really am getting better.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.110
This has changed me
in nothing but positive ways,

39:34.154 --> 39:35.938
and my doctor did tell you

39:35.982 --> 39:38.201
that she is very pleased
with my recovery.

39:38.245 --> 39:39.638
Yes.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.509
But...

39:41.553 --> 39:43.076
But what?

39:44.207 --> 39:46.253
Mick? How do you feel about it?

39:46.296 --> 39:48.037
I told you how I feel, honey.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.822
I don't want you to not go

39:49.865 --> 39:51.214
and then regret it
a few years from now.

39:51.258 --> 39:54.000
Mom, you always told me
to follow my dreams.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.654
You have to follow yours, too.

39:55.697 --> 39:59.135
We can always take
that trip of ours down the road,

39:59.179 --> 40:00.833
but this opportunity
at the Getty,

40:00.876 --> 40:02.922
it doesn't come along
very often, if ever.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.492
What about you, Jess?

40:10.190 --> 40:11.626
I am

40:11.670 --> 40:13.628
so, so happy

40:13.672 --> 40:15.500
that we are finally talking

40:15.543 --> 40:18.241
and we're open
about the past,

40:18.285 --> 40:21.506
and it's not gonna stop
if you'd be in L.A.

40:21.549 --> 40:25.335
We're still gonna Zoom
and talk on the phone and text.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.208
And just think about
the Frequent Flyer miles.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.776
But, Mom, we also
don't want to force you

40:30.819 --> 40:32.560
to do anything that you yourself
don't want to do.

40:32.604 --> 40:33.605
Absolutely not.

40:35.389 --> 40:36.956
Is that stew burning, I think?

40:36.999 --> 40:38.827
Ah! Don't change the subject.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.350
- And Abby is right.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.701
We are not trying to force you
to do anything.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.224
We're just telling you
how we feel.

40:44.267 --> 40:46.400
I understand that.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.923
And if the Getty
doesn't work out.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.316
then you'll know
it wasn't right,

40:49.359 --> 40:50.839
and you just quit.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.016
Mom, we just want you
to follow your heart.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.410
In the end,

40:56.454 --> 40:58.238
you only really regret
the chances you didn't take

40:58.281 --> 40:59.544
and the decisions
we were too afraid to make.

41:01.415 --> 41:03.330
Isn't that from
your last play?

41:03.373 --> 41:04.505
Sure is! Just felt it was
a very quotable moment

41:04.549 --> 41:05.463
right now.

41:06.551 --> 41:07.552
It totally is!

41:09.336 --> 41:11.643
Oh, you guys are...

41:14.776 --> 41:15.951
Okay.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.300
All right.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.128
Let's give L.A. a try, I guess!

41:19.172 --> 41:20.434
- Yeah!
- That's great!

41:20.478 --> 41:21.957
Let's have some wine
and celebrate that.
