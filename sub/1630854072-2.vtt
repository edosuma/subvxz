WEBVTT

00:11.886 --> 00:13.972
High time I chrome the fuck up.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.182
Get da hell out.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.393
Wanna sell, hear my offer.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.728
I'm not selling.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.730
Came here to chip this shit.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.440
Listen, Davey.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.900
That there is a military-grade piece.

00:25.984 --> 00:28.069
Got to have the build to handle it.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.613
And, choom, that's something
you ain't got.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.992
Spoken like a ripper
who really cares about his customers.

00:34.075 --> 00:37.495
Hah! Point is,
can't afford me.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.751
Whoa. Wait a minute.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.253
Fuck it, man. I'll buy it.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.505
I'll chip you up.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.676
But when you come back,
crying to yank it out…

00:52.844 --> 00:57.640
because it's poaching your brain,
the Sandy is mine for free.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.268
So, ready to rip?

02:46.082 --> 02:47.125
During the discussion,

02:47.208 --> 02:52.755
Lavabre pressured Arasaka with measures
drawn from the EU's tariff policy.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.258
Martinez, David, your tardiness
has been recorded.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.760
Check it out.
Get a load of this guy.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.762
Is he serio--

03:01.848 --> 03:04.100
You can't, Martinez. We're at school!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.019
There are cameras. Have you lost your--

03:07.270 --> 03:09.063
What? Are you afraid of getting caught?

03:09.147 --> 03:12.066
'Cause I know I sure as shit ain't.
Come on.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.693
Well?

03:47.268 --> 03:50.605
Shit. What did you do?

03:50.688 --> 03:54.192
What the hell kind of implant is that?
You broke my nose, you asshole!

03:54.275 --> 03:56.319
You're done! Know who my father is?

03:56.402 --> 04:00.448
An Arasaka exec on the Academy board!
You're so fucking gone.

04:00.531 --> 04:04.619
You should have quit while you're
ahead, you rat bastard.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.246
<i>Like I give a shit.</i>

04:11.834 --> 04:15.380
Hmm?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.147
<i>Is he serio--</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:40.613
<i>You're done! Know who my father is?</i>
<i>An Arasaka exec on the Academy board!</i>

04:40.697 --> 04:43.074
<i>You're so fucking gone!</i>

04:43.157 --> 04:44.701
Marcus,

04:44.784 --> 04:49.664
you bring me footage of my own son
being assaulted by a classmate.

04:49.747 --> 04:50.623
Why?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.876
<i>His name is David Martinez,</i>
<i>17 years old,</i>

04:53.960 --> 04:55.378
<i>from Santo Domingo.</i>

04:55.461 --> 04:56.671
<i>He is a top student</i>

04:56.754 --> 04:59.173
<i>who recently corrupted</i>
<i>Academy data and hardware</i>

04:59.257 --> 05:01.301
<i>with a bootleg wreath update.</i>

05:01.384 --> 05:04.554
<i>No father. Mother was recently killed</i>
<i>in a traffic accident.</i>

05:04.637 --> 05:06.431
<i>He owes considerable debt to the Academy.</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:07.974
Must I know all this?

05:08.057 --> 05:09.475
<i>Notice his movements, sir.</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:12.395
<i>It's clear he used the Sandevistan implant</i>
<i>former second lieutenant</i>

05:12.478 --> 05:14.981
<i>James Norris had been equipped with</i>
<i>at the time of this death.</i>

05:15.064 --> 05:18.526
I see. The case was filed
as a cyberpsychotic incident.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.653
<i>Yes, sir. Yet, unlike the soldier,</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:24.741
<i>this student displays no apparent</i>
<i>side effects stemming from the implant.</i>

05:24.824 --> 05:26.993
<i>I believe his tolerance for cybernetics</i>

05:27.076 --> 05:31.706
<i>could, in fact, make him</i>
<i>a prime candidate to test the product.</i>

05:31.789 --> 05:34.500
Hmm. Where is he now?

05:34.584 --> 05:37.045
-<i>He was expelled, sir.</i>
-Summon him.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.839
Lure him with promises of financial aid.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.008
<i>Yes, sir. And what about your son?</i>

05:42.091 --> 05:45.219
As my heir, it's high time he learned

05:45.303 --> 05:49.015
what it means to serve
the company's best interests.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.103
<i>Mr. Martinez,</i>

05:54.187 --> 05:57.023
<i>please know your expulsion</i>
<i>has been formally processed.</i>

05:57.106 --> 06:00.443
<i>However, Mr. Tanaka's parents</i>
<i>contacted us to request--</i>

06:03.029 --> 06:05.948
I am so fucked.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.920
<i>Wash cycle complete.</i>

06:55.581 --> 06:57.291
Hey! How you doing?

07:00.378 --> 07:03.047
Shit happens all the time.
I'm telling you it's a load of crap.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.558
Huh?

07:25.736 --> 07:26.779
Huh?

07:46.257 --> 07:48.176
Come on.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.053
-So, what's your angle? Spill it.
-What? My angle?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.389
What do you want?
You're messing up my work.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.059
Work, huh? If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were a pig socket.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.061
So, what? You're gonna put cuffs on me?

07:59.145 --> 08:01.522
Can't believe that you're a petty thief.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.901
Hmm…

08:04.984 --> 08:06.944
-Do I know you?
-No, uh…

08:07.028 --> 08:09.071
Not really. I don't think so.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.452
Ah! Lookey, here, boy, you are in trouble.

08:14.535 --> 08:15.495
Huh?

08:15.578 --> 08:19.874
Really? A Sandevistan?
Damn. Do tell me where you found it.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.753
Wait. Curiosity killed the cat
and all that.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.839
Crazy idea. How about we work together?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.090
Doing what? Stealing?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.885
Is it stealing if I only hit
Arasaka suits?

08:30.968 --> 08:33.721
Come on. Do I look corpo to you?

08:33.804 --> 08:37.308
Funny you should ask.
Scan did pick up an Arasaka Academy ID.

08:37.391 --> 08:41.270
But you're right, you definitely
don't look the type, that's for sure.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.981
I, uh… I dropped out.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.360
Ah! What a bad boy you are.

08:47.443 --> 08:50.279
So, you just target 'Saka, huh?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.156
Why? You in?

08:52.240 --> 08:55.368
Gonna break poor mama's heart
if she finds out, you know.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.038
Listen up. Lesson number 1.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.541
Less judgment, more awareness.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.543
Yeah, yeah. So, what's my cut?

09:03.626 --> 09:06.295
We'll split the haul, 80-20.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.883
What? Fuck that. We go halfsies
on the work and then I get ennies?

09:10.967 --> 09:13.511
I'm the one who'll be pushing
the club shards.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.013
Plus, got a trainee to supervise now.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.682
Trainee? Come on.

09:17.765 --> 09:21.435
I'm really tight on eddies right now.
60-40's fair, ain't it?

09:22.144 --> 09:23.604
70-30.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.024
And I'll pay the second the job's done.
I think that's fair.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.695
-Alright. Sounds fine.
-It's a deal.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.446
I'm Lucy, 'kay?.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.324
Name's David.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
<i>Clear? Reading me clear?</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:41.080
<i>Crystal. Good.</i>

09:41.163 --> 09:44.458
<i>My end too. Our mark, yeah?</i>

09:44.542 --> 09:45.960
<i>Three o'clock. Don't turn.</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:47.837
<i>Got 'im.</i>

09:47.920 --> 09:49.213
<i>Moving in.</i>

09:50.506 --> 09:53.467
<i>Okay, set? Ready… to roll.</i>

09:53.551 --> 09:56.971
<i>Three, two, one… Showtime.</i>

10:04.895 --> 10:06.397
<i>Easy as pie!</i>

10:06.480 --> 10:09.400
<i>Chill, noob, chill.</i>
<i>Real deal's next.</i>

10:09.483 --> 10:10.443
<i>Bring it!</i>

10:10.526 --> 10:13.946
<i>Three chirpy shesuits? Yada-go!</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:16.824
<i>Then the two two braindance glazed.</i>

10:17.408 --> 10:18.909
<i>Easy.</i>

10:18.993 --> 10:20.995
<i>Come on. Challenge, please.</i>

10:21.078 --> 10:24.540
<i>Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Big fish, big loot coming up.</i>

10:24.624 --> 10:27.293
<i>Sounds…</i>

10:27.376 --> 10:29.086
<i>Doesn't scream corpo to me.</i>

10:29.170 --> 10:31.213
<i>No. Hired muscle. Ready?</i>

10:31.297 --> 10:33.507
-<i>Three, two, one.</i>
-<i>Wait.</i>

10:41.140 --> 10:43.643
<i>Nice, nice.</i>
<i>We've bled this car dry.</i>

10:43.726 --> 10:45.478
<i>Next stop, we ghost.</i>

10:45.561 --> 10:46.854
<i>Roger that.</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:52.568
-So, how did I do?
-I'd say you're well worth the 20%.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.695
Hey, it's 30!

10:54.779 --> 10:56.155
Kidding.

10:56.864 --> 11:00.117
-Keep it rolling? Another car?
-A different line maybe?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.662
Somebody's probably
tipped the pigs off by now.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.622
When we hop around, less chance--

11:07.541 --> 11:08.793
How bad is he?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.419
Typical rookie mistake.

11:10.503 --> 11:14.131
Hasn't taken any precautions
since the implant was installed.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.217
Which immunosuppressant is he on?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.552
Hey, this guy insured?

11:18.636 --> 11:21.889
Haven't got a clue.
For sure doesn't look like he would be.

11:21.972 --> 11:25.643
Any family, legal guardian?
Anyone I can call?

11:25.726 --> 11:28.604
Dunno. Parents, I guess.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.773
Used to go to Arasaka Academy.

11:30.856 --> 11:34.235
Arasaka?
No wonder he could afford…

11:34.318 --> 11:37.029
Hey. Hold on a sec.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.116
Morning. So, how are you feeling?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.451
I'm gonna hurl.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.286
Remember which pills you take?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.414
-Pills?
-What?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.001
Wow, man!You're psycho.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.174
Hey, lady, we just passed the hospital--

11:57.258 --> 11:58.467
Oh my.

11:58.551 --> 12:02.304
Listen, choom, this kid got an implant on
him that'll fetch at least a couple of K.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.099
-So, just sit back and relax and--
-Is that right?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.309
You, like, cut a deal
with some Scavengers?

12:07.393 --> 12:10.062
I said sit back and chill
or we'll probe you for chrome too.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.647
Sorry, David.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.817
Looks like we gotta change our plans.
You're back to 20.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.444
Huh?

12:27.621 --> 12:30.291
Oh my God! Yeah!

12:48.642 --> 12:50.311
Whoops.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.731
Hey, doin' okay? Not gonna die, are ya?

12:53.814 --> 12:56.275
-Doc, please.
-Huh?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.569
Doc's clinic. Ripperdoc. Get me there.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.080
David, buddy.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.167
Man, you look like shit.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.460
Thanks a lot.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.796
How many times you fired up?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.340
Six. No, maybe eight.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.258
Jesus Henry Christ.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.094
Grown-ass man couldn't take
that punishment.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.680
I was fine an hour ago and then…

13:26.764 --> 13:28.474
my nose popped a cork.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.686
Gonk had no immunoblockers.
You care to explain?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.231
Ah, didn't really see the need.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.401
Thought wrong, then.
Sell him the meds.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.780
Shit off this shelf
ain't gonna cut it. Different league.

13:42.863 --> 13:43.948
You good for it?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.908
You're fucking charging me?

13:45.991 --> 13:49.829
Fucking right, I am!
Ain't runnin' no charity, choom.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.081
How much'll these buy?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.084
Two days' worth.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.253
That's it?

13:57.336 --> 13:59.922
Hey, feel free
to shop around, sweetheart.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.925
'Cause that might land you
back with the Scavs.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.011
Greedy bastard.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.434
Sure you wouldn't rather have it gone?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.769
Nope.

14:13.853 --> 14:18.816
Still can't quite believe you fired that
thing up eight times in one goddamn day.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.277
You're either a total masochist or…

14:21.360 --> 14:23.821
Listen close, Davey. Two a day, no more.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.699
Three maybe, but that's the max.
No bullshit.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.952
Even if your body can take it,
that egghead of yours sure can't.

14:30.035 --> 14:34.373
Keep fucking around and that implant
gonna scramble ya brain.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.711
You're saying a single implant
could make me a cyberpsycho?

14:38.794 --> 14:42.214
Is that even possible?
Never heard of that happenin' before.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.549
Well, Davey,

14:43.632 --> 14:46.051
guess you just heard it from me,
didn't ya?

14:57.354 --> 14:58.439
Hmm?

15:03.819 --> 15:06.447
-So, you all done?
-Uh, yeah.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.782
Well, then I guess
that's a wrap for today.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.784
I'm good. I can keep running.

15:10.868 --> 15:15.080
You big dope. I'm not about to start
babysitting a cyberpsycho.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.918
Sandevistan, only use it
when you got no other choice.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.003
Lots of other ways to turn out eds.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.131
Still wanna work with me even after that?

15:24.214 --> 15:27.259
Think I'd let you go
without paying me back first?

15:29.803 --> 15:32.473
Good. I definitely need
the eddies.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.724
That's the spirit.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.103
Sure you're not up
for some more tonight?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.230
I'm kind of lagging on rent.

15:40.314 --> 15:44.818
-Not tonight. Tomorrow.
-Okay, okay.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.492
-Come on.
-Huh? I knew you'd want to!

15:51.575 --> 15:53.786
It's not work-related.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.787
Huh?

15:56.497 --> 15:57.623
Right here.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.250
You, uh… live alone?

16:00.334 --> 16:03.003
-Hm-mmm. And?
-Nothing.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.508
-What? Nervous or something?
-Of course not.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.010
-This your first time?
-Hell, no.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.513
Shut up, will ya!

16:13.222 --> 16:14.264
Sit down. Relax.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.976
Beer's all I got. You drink?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.519
Uh, of course, yeah.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.603
Cheers.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.278
Oh, boy.

16:28.862 --> 16:32.074
Seriously? So, it is
your first time drinking.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.994
-No, I have. It's just--
-Hm-mmm.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.496
Fizzy drink and smokes, don't do neither.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.207
I wouldn't
tease you about that.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.291
I'm telling the truth.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.294
Sure you are.
What's with the getup anyway?

16:47.840 --> 16:48.757
Take it off.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.217
What? Why?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.635
Just do it. Come on.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.178
Hey!

16:55.139 --> 16:58.976
Uh, wait. Don't mess with that. Come on.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.062
Uh… Edgerunners?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.940
Another word for cyberpunk.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.067
It's who you wanna be, don't ya?

17:08.360 --> 17:11.071
JK's <i>Edgerunners</i> series.
Shit, yeah, I'm a fan.

17:12.322 --> 17:13.323
You serious?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.826
Right back at ya.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.704
Like that kinda gunk poster.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.206
Got a problem?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.625
Uh… No problem.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.586
Just always whacked me out.

17:25.669 --> 17:30.007
All of those ads makin' it seem like
it's some kind of paradise or something.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.469
Lots of peeps died tryin' to turn
that dumb rock into something useful.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.221
More like a prison camp than a paradise,
if you ask me.

17:37.264 --> 17:40.184
Sounds to me like someone
did their homework.

17:40.267 --> 17:44.188
Uh, not really.
Just a bunch of shit I learned in school.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.940
Begging your pardon, prep boy.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.318
It ain't like that.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.362
Isn't it? Never met a pleb
who attended a 'Saka school.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.405
It's not!

17:57.618 --> 18:00.621
My, uh, my mom and I
weren't very well off.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.373
There's no way they would have
accepted me off the street like that.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.502
She worked damn hard to keep me
in the Academy,

18:06.585 --> 18:09.463
scraping together eddies
anyways she could.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.507
You wanna know the real kicker though?

18:11.590 --> 18:14.134
I knew from day 1 I'd never belong there.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.554
So why stick around for so long?
Or at all.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.139
Good fuckin' question.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.183
Guess it was for Mom. You know.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.520
"You'll get a job at Arasaka,
climb the corpo ladder."

18:25.145 --> 18:29.858
Was kinda her dream, all that 'Saka stuff.
Our dream, I guess.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.110
Or whatever.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.781
-It's not your dream, though, is it?
-My dream?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.284
Well, yeah. You, your mom,
you're different people.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.621
Why should you work to achieve her dream?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.791
Actually, there's nothing wrong with that.

18:45.874 --> 18:48.669
You need to find your own dream.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.547
Sounds to me
like you already found yours.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.550
Is that a joke, or what?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.385
You called it a prison camp.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.514
To me, this city is a whole lot worse.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.890
This place?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.810
I wanna go away. Far as possible.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.940
-Come on. Got something to show ya.
-Huh?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.708
Whoa! Check out this resolution!

19:27.791 --> 19:29.751
I can feel the fucking sun.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.253
That's through your personal link.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.714
It's what allows you
to feel the heat of the sun.

19:33.797 --> 19:36.967
Of course, you'd be fried crispy
if I gave you the actual temp.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.262
I made sure to lower the settings,
mellow out the experience.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.347
Dial it back up?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.349
No way! This is totally preem!

19:45.517 --> 19:46.852
You look ridiculous!

19:53.483 --> 19:56.278
-Nova, huh?
-Fucking awesome!

19:56.361 --> 19:57.571
Isn't it?

19:59.781 --> 20:00.866
Over here.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.193
Hm?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.540
First time I've shown anyone this.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.208
Oh, really?

21:34.876 --> 21:38.463
Uh, so, like, why me?

21:39.256 --> 21:42.801
Dunno. Guess it just felt right.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.681
Got this feeling.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.725
Think you and I'd make a pretty good team.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.728
I think so too.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.033
<i>You fell</i>
<i>over the edge, punk.</i>

22:07.617 --> 22:10.162
Huh?

22:10.245 --> 22:14.291
Tough deal, bud. That implant
you chipped is all mine.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.044
I'm taking it back now.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.179
Uh…
