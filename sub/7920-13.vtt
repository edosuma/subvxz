00:02.536 --> 00:03.936
Boo! Sorry to startle you.

00:03.938 --> 00:05.537
You didn't startle us.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.639
Yeah, you struggled with the
lock for, like, 30 seconds.

00:07.641 --> 00:08.841
I got a new job!

00:08.843 --> 00:10.275
Babe, that's great.
Oh, that's awesome.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.944
Well, not really "new."

00:11.946 --> 00:14.446
I'm starting on a trial
basis tomorrow.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.781
So where is it?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.116
Is it at that super
crunchy school?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.284
It's the most progressive
school in Los Angeles.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.987
It's basically heaven
if heaven were populated

00:21.989 --> 00:24.289
with kids that look like tiny
members of Arcade Fire.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.058
Sounds like
your dream job.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.960
I'd give you a hug, but my shirt
smells pretty weird today.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.294
Thank you.
I was actually worried.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.462
It was getting rough out there.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.965
(speaking French)

00:35.803 --> 00:36.802
Ah...

00:36.804 --> 00:38.704
La-la-la-la-la-la.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.573
God, I miss Paris.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.142
Stop it!

00:43.144 --> 00:44.309
Wha...? I was
drinking that.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.477
It's Jess's.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.146
Every time she gets
a job at a new school,

00:47.148 --> 00:48.313
she brings back kid germs

00:48.315 --> 00:49.982
that infect your filthy body.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.150
Don't get me sick.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.484
Don't get me sick
either, man.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.987
I got a date coming up,
and I might get to mouth-base.

00:54.989 --> 00:56.321
I'm not gonna get sick.

00:56.323 --> 00:59.324
No germ can live in a
body that is 65% beer.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.994
Nick, are you eating
raisins from my purse?

01:01.996 --> 01:03.829
I confiscated those from a kid.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.664
That explains why
they're so sticky.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.266
(chuckles)
Sticky Nicky eats anything

01:07.268 --> 01:09.168
and I don't get sick.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.503
Nick, you have, like, 7,500
raisins all over your room.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.338
Why would you eat the...?
(sneezes)

01:13.340 --> 01:15.340
I knew it. I knew it.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.042
That was so immediate.

nondenominational Eden.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.627
Wow.
I know.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.062
JESS: Did the kids build
the chicken coup?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.398
Yep. Only hens,
though, obviously.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.067
Banyon Canyon has a strict
"zero cocks" policy.

01:42.069 --> 01:45.037
I like how it... it encourages
the chickens to stay inside

01:45.039 --> 01:46.371
but doesn't force them.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.040
In line with our philosophy.

01:48.042 --> 01:50.909
Who are we to tell the children
what to learn and when?

01:50.911 --> 01:52.711
Their teachers?

01:52.713 --> 01:56.048
Williamsburg ate
my seaweed, Genevieve.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.382
No, I didn't.

01:57.384 --> 01:59.384
Don, Williamsburg, do
I have your permission

01:59.386 --> 02:01.887
to move this conflict
to the Feelings Farm?

02:01.889 --> 02:05.224
W-Wait, Jess, we sit
on the floor.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.658
Chairs are reserved
for the children's feelings.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.060
Oh.

02:08.062 --> 02:11.230
This is much better than solving
problems the Coolidge way.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.898
There's a fight in the gym!

02:12.900 --> 02:13.899
Oh, my God!

02:13.901 --> 02:15.567
I got this, Jess.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.570
CHILDREN (chanting):
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

02:18.572 --> 02:20.305
(chanting stops)

02:21.742 --> 02:24.910
I've been thinking about
starting to wear a watch again.

02:24.912 --> 02:29.014
Let me open the barn door
and welcome Honesty.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.283
BOTH:
Hi, Honesty.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.619
Williamsburg, now,
Honesty is here

02:33.621 --> 02:36.421
and has no agenda
but to listen.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.091
Honesty, I ate
the seaweed.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.425
And I'm sorry.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.529
And, Don, do you have
anything to say to Honesty?

02:43.531 --> 02:46.431
Honesty, sorry for
being so macho.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.767
I'm sorry I picked you
last for touch basket.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.204
I'm sorry I insulted you
for having a mommy and daddy.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.438
Beautiful, Jess.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.439
Well done.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.274
Thank you.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.276
Into quarantine, you.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.710
Huge presentation

02:58.712 --> 02:59.711
at Ass-Strat tomorrow,

02:59.713 --> 03:01.280

be sick for it.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.615
Women I work with hate weakness.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.751
You show up sick,
you-you might as well be dead.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.721
(sneezes)

03:09.723 --> 03:12.057
Uh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.392
No, uh, it wasn't
really...

03:13.394 --> 03:15.727
Get out.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.529
Guys, I'm on the mend.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.330
Sorry, Nick.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.831
(sneezes)

03:19.833 --> 03:21.466
Winston here has got that hot
coffee date tomorrow, so...

03:21.468 --> 03:24.036
But, to be clear, the date's
hot, not the coffee.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.337
Uh, thinking about going iced.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.638
Don't look at my hands.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.740
Thanks for backing me up, boo.
Oh, you know how boo do.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.642
You know who's my boo?
I got a clue it's you.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.744
Aw...

03:32.746 --> 03:34.046
(sneezes)

03:37.084 --> 03:40.018
So...

03:40.020 --> 03:42.487
this is the most time
we've ever spent alone.

03:42.489 --> 03:45.490
Pretty interesting observation
on your part.

03:45.492 --> 03:46.825
Yeah.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.660
What are we...
what are we watching?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.662
We are having a...

03:50.664 --> 03:53.365
I just started streaming it,
and now it won't stop playing.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.367
Boy, ham sandwiches.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.368
(laughs)

03:56.370 --> 03:57.569
What is it?

03:57.571 --> 03:58.904
It's hard to say.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.572
It's either
a puppet show for kids,

04:00.574 --> 04:02.507
or it's North Korean propaganda.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.943
(screaming)

04:04.945 --> 04:06.178
Pretty weird.

GENEVIEVE: I feel like
we have a real connection.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.454
Me, too.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.189
I know it's only the first day
of your trial period,

04:17.191 --> 04:20.859
but my gut is telling me...

04:20.861 --> 04:22.394
you're a perfect fit.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.396
I just-- like, I'm so
happy here, I could cry,

04:24.398 --> 04:25.731
but the gray water bucket's
too far away,

04:25.733 --> 04:28.033
and I want to save my tears
to water these plants.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.368
That's considerate. Ooh!

04:29.370 --> 04:31.036
My partner's here
to pick me up.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.204
I think you're gonna
really like him.

04:32.206 --> 04:33.372
SAM:
Sorry I'm late.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.374
The string came out
of my prayer beads,

04:35.376 --> 04:36.575
and they just bounced
all over the office.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.709
Oh...
So frustrating.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.378
GENEVIEVE: Sam, I want
you to meet Jess.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.380
This is the candidate we were
discussing in the shower.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.548
Yeah. Jess, this
is Sam, my partner.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.386
Hey, Jess.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.556
You're a doctor
for children.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.991
Uh, it's, you know,
mostly paperwork.

04:52.993 --> 04:56.228
How do you always look
so beautiful in the morning?

04:56.230 --> 04:57.496

Oh, my God.

You could have killed him.

kick your ass, man.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.802
Hi, Sam.
Hi.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.406
Have you met before?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.907
We... Yeah, we've met.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.909
We did. Yes, that's right,
we met, we met.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.911
(laughing): How funny.
Um, a bunch of times.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.579
A lot of times. Very many.
A lot of times.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.747
We met a lot... Yeah.

Sometimes in the day,
sometimes...

more fly shirts.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.310
Okay, let's make this quick.

05:45.312 --> 05:46.778
I need to work
on my presentation.

05:46.780 --> 05:47.879
It's for a chair company,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.281
and it's tentatively titled,

05:49.283 --> 05:51.416
"I Hope You're Sitting
Down for This."

05:52.619 --> 05:53.952
'Cause it's chairs.
Yeah.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.287

would laugh if you weren't

05:55.289 --> 05:56.621

05:56.623 --> 05:58.957
Okay, Winston,
what are you wearing?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.459
Well, you know,
I don't want to overthink it.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.461
It's just coffee, so...

06:02.463 --> 06:04.129
So you're going to just
dress like you did today,

during a solar eclipse

since the Aly heartbreak.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.748
(sniffling)

08:03.750 --> 08:06.251
All these puppets do is sing
about how they're friends.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.420
I'm starting
to not believe them.

08:08.422 --> 08:09.521
(fanfare plays)
Shh!

08:09.523 --> 08:10.922
This is the best part.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.859
The Tee-Tee Wah Wah was in...

08:13.861 --> 08:16.261
(drumroll plays)

08:17.865 --> 08:19.197
It's in the damn
Pee-Paw Playhouse!

08:19.199 --> 08:20.932
Shh.
Spoiler alert, man.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.602
The Pee-Paw Playhouse!

08:23.604 --> 08:24.936
(laughing)

08:24.938 --> 08:26.271
Every time.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.272
I've been saying
that for the past hour

08:27.274 --> 08:28.273
'cause I saw you
put it in there!

08:28.275 --> 08:29.274
You know what?

08:29.276 --> 08:31.476
I can't. I can not.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.644
I'm not sick.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.712
I've been faking it.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.647
There you go,<i> Poppycock Palace.</i>

08:35.649 --> 08:37.449
You've outed me!

08:37.451 --> 08:38.884
You're choosing to be in here?
Why?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.485
'Cause I'm freaking out
about the date. Okay?

08:40.487 --> 08:42.287
Why don't you want
to go on this date?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.788
Because I'm not over Aly.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.790
And I know
I should be moving on

08:45.792 --> 08:47.325
and this girl is okay,

08:47.327 --> 08:48.493
but she's not Aly.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.394
(congested):
No one is Aly.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.329
What'd she say?

08:51.331 --> 08:52.631
Wait.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.632
Just hold.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.666
Oh, please don't blow your nose.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.667
You do it so disgustingly.

08:55.669 --> 08:56.902
(blowing loudly)

08:59.306 --> 09:01.473
Not done.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.408
I don't need to know that bad
what you said.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.477
(Cece blowing nose loudly)

09:08.682 --> 09:10.515
(continues blowing)

09:10.517 --> 09:12.183
I'm beggin' you to stop.
Just stop.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.351
(sniffs wetly)

09:13.353 --> 09:14.986
(coughs)

09:14.988 --> 09:17.422
(clearly):
No one is Aly.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.491
Okay? You have to give
other people a chance.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.593
You deserve to be happy,
Winston.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.928
Just go on the date.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.063
Or I could fire up
another episode

09:25.065 --> 09:27.699
and we could see where they hide
the Tee-Tee Wah Wah this time.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.000
I wonder where it would be.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.637
(breathing roughly)

09:34.274 --> 09:35.941
No, I'm-I'm gonna go
on the date.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.108
Yeah, I think I'll do that.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.109
You guys are right.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.210
Could you tell
your future husband

09:39.212 --> 09:40.445
to let me out
of this room, please?

09:40.447 --> 09:41.613
I love that man,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.214
but he is not letting
anyone out of this room.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.449
Just being in here

09:44.451 --> 09:46.117
makes you fully contaminated.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.619
(puppets chattering happily)

09:47.621 --> 09:49.454
Uh, hey, I was hoping

09:49.456 --> 09:51.189
you could put in
a good word for me.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.190
I know you're mad...

09:52.192 --> 09:53.592
No, I'm not mad, Jess.

09:53.594 --> 09:57.028
I'm just, you know,
bummed that you're at my house.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.030
Obviously, I know
I messed up our relationship

09:59.032 --> 10:01.566
and you probably think
I'm a bad person,

10:01.568 --> 10:03.535
but if you could...
Jess!

10:03.537 --> 10:04.869
What are you doing here?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.305
At my lover's house?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.541
Oh!

10:09.543 --> 10:11.076
Hi! Hi.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.044
Um, were you...
Making love?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.346
Just finished.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.382
He defused me like a bomb.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.752
That sounds nice.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.754
Um...
Did you bake...

10:22.756 --> 10:24.255
Sam brownies?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.725
No. Chocolate's<i> way</i> too sexual.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.259
(laughs)

10:28.261 --> 10:30.362
This is just good,
old-fashioned Kansas cornbread.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.404
Jess...

10:39.406 --> 10:41.339
No.
(chuckles)

10:41.341 --> 10:44.275
...my gut is telling me

10:44.277 --> 10:46.077
this isn't going to work out.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.912
Please give me a chance
to make this right.

10:47.914 --> 10:48.913
Five minutes.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.584
Mmm...

10:52.586 --> 10:56.855
(high-pitched):
Mmm...

11:01.361 --> 11:03.428
♪ ♪

11:09.770 --> 11:10.835
Okay, good morning.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.837
Yes, help yourself to a bagel.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.272
Hmm.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.440
They're all
the same, Jan.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.175
No need to put your hands
on every one of them.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.977
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

11:18.979 --> 11:20.812
as you know,

11:20.814 --> 11:23.982
on the seventh day,
God... he rested.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.117
Yes, that's right.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.452
God rested on
the seventh day.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.287
But the question remains:

11:29.289 --> 11:30.789
what did he rest on?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.191
That's right.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.860
He rested... on a chair.

11:37.964 --> 11:38.963
(sneezes)

11:40.133 --> 11:41.466
Oh...

11:44.504 --> 11:45.670
Look underneath
your butts.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.205
You will find

11:47.207 --> 11:49.074
mankind's greatest invention.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.975
(exhales) Without chairs,
do you know what we have?

11:50.977 --> 11:53.645
Squat, both position
and diddly kind.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.413
JESS:
<i> Sam, you got rid of your sofa.</i>

11:55.415 --> 11:57.682
Boy, that thing
really gave me a rash.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.717
Five minutes, Jess.

11:58.719 --> 11:59.851
Okay, look.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.985
I know it's weird to hire

12:00.987 --> 12:02.220
your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend,

12:02.222 --> 12:04.089
but I think
it's another way

12:04.091 --> 12:05.857
in which we are linked.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.493
You are the best candidate
we've had in a long time.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.161
Thank you.
As we all know,

12:10.163 --> 12:12.230
healing is talking.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.865
Samuel, what
do you think?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.166
I would love to explore
all of this with you,

12:15.168 --> 12:16.868
but I have
a circumcision to perform.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.336
Hopefully not your own.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.507
Just kidding.
I know you're circumcised.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.342
Ha, ha. Yeah.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.244
Well, not that I think
about it, it just...

12:26.246 --> 12:28.413
I mean, I'm definitely not
picturing it right now.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.881
I am picturing it.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.249
Only 'cause we talked about it.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.851
How long did you two
share your journeys?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.719
Couple months.
But at first it was just sex.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.287
Mmm. Mmm.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.355
SAM:
I used sex

12:37.357 --> 12:39.424
as a wall around my heart.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.961
Mmm. Uh, Jess climbed that
wall many, many times.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.863
Mmm.
Uh, couldn't stop climbing it.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.865
I think I was not the only
climber to climb that wall.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.366
Until we decided to become

12:48.368 --> 12:51.102
a one-wall,
one-climber mountain.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.437
And then you invited
another climber

12:52.439 --> 12:54.205
to lick your toehold.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.976
My roommate, Nick, kissed me.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.144
I'm so sorry, Sam.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.211
I exist only in the present.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.379
All of that's
behind me.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.314
What... what about
this Nick?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.916
Is he sorry?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.051
I think Nick's
kind of still upset

13:07.053 --> 13:08.553
that Sam punched him
in the throat.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.354
What?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.156
Sam...

13:11.158 --> 13:12.390
so tender and delicate...

13:12.392 --> 13:13.591
You haven't met Nick.

13:13.593 --> 13:14.926
He's just the most
throat-punchable boy

13:14.928 --> 13:16.227
in all the world.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.229
I don't care.
I don't even...

13:18.231 --> 13:19.898
Nick is a whatever,
I don't even have to...

13:19.900 --> 13:21.566
Sam, do you need this Nick
to apologize for wounding you?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.700
I do.

13:23.904 --> 13:24.936
JESS:
<i> So, Nick...</i>

13:24.938 --> 13:26.437
I'm wondering if you could

13:26.439 --> 13:28.006
come in the other room with me

13:28.008 --> 13:29.440
and just, like, real quick,

13:29.442 --> 13:30.842
apologize to Sam for kissing me?

13:30.844 --> 13:31.843
No.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.511
Jess, I told you
to leave it alone.

13:33.513 --> 13:34.846
I didn't, though.

13:34.848 --> 13:35.914
I made it worse.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.115
Now the only way

13:37.117 --> 13:38.983
I'm gonna get that job

13:38.985 --> 13:42.020
is if Nick apologizes to Sam.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.454
Jess, he hit me.
He's gonna hit me again.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.522
He's not gonna hit you.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.257
Please, it's my dream job.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.725
(puppets chattering)

13:49.095 --> 13:51.629
I'd like to apologize, Nick,

13:51.631 --> 13:53.431
for punching you in the throat.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.599
I know it hurt a whole lot.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.700
Not that much,
but you did it, so...

13:55.702 --> 13:56.801
Okay.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.803
And I feel like you should
apologize to me

13:58.805 --> 14:01.206
for kissing my girlfriend.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.841
Yes, uh, right.

14:02.843 --> 14:03.908
Cool.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.778
(exhales)
Well, that went so well.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.848
I-I don't really feel like
that was a genuine apology,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.282
and-and I'd really like one.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.817
Yeah. I mean... did you
feel like it was genuine?

14:12.819 --> 14:14.619
No. Actually, he
didn't even apologize.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.487
Cool beard, Sam.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.057
What'd you just say
about my beard, bro?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.058
"Bro"?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.392
Yeah, I just said "cool beard."

14:21.394 --> 14:22.894
I think your beard
looks really cool.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.730
Talk about my beard
one more time, bro.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.298
Sam, "bro" is a beach term.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.068
The beard is very fun.
Say "beard."

14:30.070 --> 14:31.135
You want me to say the word

14:31.137 --> 14:32.303
that starts with a "B,"

14:32.305 --> 14:33.304
ends with a "D"?
Yeah.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.873
Say "beard" one more time, bro.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.878
Say the word "beard," bro!

14:41.147 --> 14:43.481
(quietly):
Beard.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.583
(grunts)
Oh! Oh!

14:45.585 --> 14:47.018
Nick, are you dying?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.152
'Cause it looks
like you're dying!

14:48.154 --> 14:49.187
Not dying.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.355
Who are you?
I don't know what it is.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.257
I just can't help it
with this guy.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
Why didn't you just hit me
in the nads

14:53.493 --> 14:54.592
like a normal person, Sam?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.694
Well, I'm leaving.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.496
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait! Don't, don't go!

14:58.498 --> 14:59.697
Nobody goes.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.199
Jim Morrison.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.367
That's who you look like.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.868
We are solving this conflict

15:03.870 --> 15:06.738
in the mother-loving
Feelings Farm.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.714
Those sunglasses are amazing.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.016
Well, they're made
even more amazing

15:18.018 --> 15:19.550
by your reflection in them.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.020
Wait, how are you seeing
my reflection in them?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.521
You got me.
I'm not.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.522
(both laugh)

15:24.524 --> 15:25.790
I'm just running game.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.026
Are you this smooth-talking
in regular glasses?

15:28.028 --> 15:29.460
No, I'm not
that smooth-talking, no.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.863
I'm not.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.231
JESS:
Honesty,

15:33.233 --> 15:36.100
I stole coffee
from a bagel restaurant.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.870
Um, I didn't know
how the line worked.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.905
Okay, now I've talked.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.473
Uh, who wants
to go next-- Sam?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.375
Sure, uh, Honesty,

15:44.377 --> 15:47.478
I honestly want Nick to
apologize for kissing Jess.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.047
I did apologize, Sam.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.150
Real, real quick-- you have
to address Honesty directly.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.052
You want me to
talk to a chair?

15:54.054 --> 15:55.219
(quietly):
I don't want to.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.587
Hey, you like soup?

15:56.589 --> 15:58.122
Right? You like
soup, right?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.457
Of course I like soup.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.892
All right, well,
address the chair

16:00.894 --> 16:01.926
and I'll make you some soup.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.394
NICK:
No strings attached.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.562
Well, except for the
string of the chair.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.997
All right.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.232
Honesty,

16:08.234 --> 16:11.069
I'm, uh, sorry I ki...

16:11.071 --> 16:12.303
You know what?
I'm not.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.073
I'm not sorry
that I kissed your girlfriend.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.240
'Cause, first of all,

16:16.242 --> 16:17.442
she wanted me to!

16:17.444 --> 16:19.577
And it was fun.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.912
It felt great.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.413
And then we dated
for a long time

16:22.415 --> 16:24.916
and that was fun.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.418
You were out of the picture,
not even in her thoughts.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.687
It was a whole new thing.
We just, we fell in love

16:29.689 --> 16:31.789
with each other,
like crazy love-- like,

16:31.791 --> 16:34.359
a lot of good memories,
a lot of passion.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.794
A lot of good sex.
Nick.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.263
We once tried to sneak
into the Kids' Choice Awards,

16:39.265 --> 16:42.033
and we got in
and watched a bunch of kids

16:42.035 --> 16:44.102
get awards.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.871
So, yeah.

16:46.873 --> 16:47.872
Nick.
Topped...

16:47.874 --> 16:49.807
Okay.
I have a fever of 103

16:49.809 --> 16:52.310
and I'm talking to a chair and
I'm not a great talk...  O-Okay.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.445
Cool, cool. Well, I think
everything's good then.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.947
Sam, I can feel you
holding back.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.782
If you can't be honest now

16:57.784 --> 16:59.550
in this strange place
to that hideous chair,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.853
how can I trust you
with my mind,

17:01.855 --> 17:03.788
my breasts

17:03.790 --> 17:05.890
and my precious yoni.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.291
Sounds like it's full
of yarn. (laughs)

17:07.293 --> 17:09.360
Okay, fine.
Honesty, all right,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.629
I... had a really hard time

17:11.631 --> 17:13.798
opening up to someone
and then I met Jess

17:13.800 --> 17:15.967
and...

17:15.969 --> 17:17.535
and I thought
we were...

17:19.372 --> 17:20.805
We were great together.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.074
And then Nick kissed her,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.810
and I-I went down
kind of a weird path.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.712
I gained 85 pounds.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.814
And then I lost, like, 100.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.249
I had no idea.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.484
Poured almost all my money
into silkworms.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.519
They froze to death.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.821
Now I'm doing yoga,
meditation,

17:36.823 --> 17:39.223
and... I'm a vegan

17:39.225 --> 17:41.426
and I don't know.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.428
What the hell have I become?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.363
Look at these shoes, huh?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.498
Look at these
ridiculous shoes!

17:47.500 --> 17:48.599
I like those shoes.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.201
They're made
from recycled shoes.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.769
They are so dumb!

17:51.771 --> 17:53.337
I don't know who I am!

17:53.339 --> 17:54.605
I want

17:54.607 --> 17:57.141
to go back to who I was!

18:04.284 --> 18:07.018
There he is.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.920
The real Sam.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.021
Wow!

18:10.857 --> 18:12.623
(exclaiming)

18:12.625 --> 18:16.194
What a breakthrough!
Sam.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.029
It is an honor to meet you.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.832
I'm Genevieve.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.140
And I am also dumping you.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.374
Okay, that's great.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.909
That's perfect, yeah.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.078
As usual, I have had
a terrible time

18:34.080 --> 18:36.214
in your horrible loft

18:36.216 --> 18:39.750
with all of you
idiot people.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.652
Sam, wait!

18:41.654 --> 18:43.321
If you take your bike,
will you relock mine?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.890
Thank you.

18:45.892 --> 18:49.393
Oh, Genevieve, I am so sorry.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.162
Don't be, don't be.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.431
I wanted a resolution

18:53.433 --> 18:55.233
and I got one.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.734
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:56.736 --> 18:58.569
I'm going to call

18:58.571 --> 19:01.405
my childhood phone number
and scream at whoever picks up.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.607
I'll see you Monday.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.575
Wait, I got the job?

19:04.577 --> 19:06.410
Of course you did.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.412
This was one of
the most profound

19:08.414 --> 19:11.082
Feelings Farm I have
ever been a part of.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.584
Radical, Jess, radical.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.019
Uh, yeah, I have questions

19:15.021 --> 19:16.521
about where to park and stuff,
but you know,

19:16.523 --> 19:18.089
I'll just, uh,
I'll text you!

19:18.091 --> 19:19.924
Ha!
(door closes)

19:19.926 --> 19:21.926
What if the big letter
comes back?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.361
I can't believe
it just took a high fever

19:23.363 --> 19:25.463
for me to like this show.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.697
Not if it's silent!

19:26.699 --> 19:27.798
Well, I hate it.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.634
Why is the Crispy Castle

19:29.636 --> 19:31.102
bigger than Mount Tummy Tum?

19:31.104 --> 19:32.203
It's dang gibberish.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.371
How was your presentation?

19:33.373 --> 19:34.805
(groans)
Well, thank you for asking.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.941
It was a disaster.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.310
We can expect robust grow...

19:39.312 --> 19:40.845
(snorts)

19:41.981 --> 19:44.715
Are you holding in a sneeze?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.784
(quietly):
Mm-mm.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.788
(quiet sneeze)

19:50.790 --> 19:52.490
God, where did it even go?

19:52.492 --> 19:54.792
(chuckles)

19:54.794 --> 19:55.927
(sneezing)

19:58.831 --> 19:59.964
Son of a bitch.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.667
How did I get sick?
I was so careful.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.968
You did the best you could.
I have no idea, man.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.570
We're missing<i> Poppycock. </i>
You guys,

20:05.572 --> 20:08.139
I hate that Sam's
out there mad at me.

20:08.141 --> 20:09.574
Because he's mad at you

20:09.576 --> 20:11.642
or because you still
have feelings for him?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.344
Because he's mad at me.
If I could just...

20:13.346 --> 20:15.413
ALL: Leave it alone.
Leave it alone, Jess.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.615
Right.
You're right.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.154
Wow, you shaved.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.722
I mean, not "wow"
like I like it.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.158
I mean...
I don't not like it.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.327
What are you doing here?
I, I don't want your cornbread.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.762
It's not cornbread.
It's, uh,

20:31.764 --> 20:32.997
it's brownies.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.399
(laughs)
Um...

20:36.436 --> 20:39.337
Hey, I'm sorry we broke up.

20:39.339 --> 20:42.840
And I think for me
it was just...

20:42.842 --> 20:44.842
weird timing.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.011
But I agree with you.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.679
We were...

20:48.681 --> 20:50.681
great together.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.084
Really great.

20:56.189 --> 20:58.356
(both chuckle)

21:20.813 --> 21:24.348
Get out of my life.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.257
Big shift in tone there.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.993
(sighs)

21:35.995 --> 21:38.963
<i> Eh, Nick'll eat 'em.</i>
