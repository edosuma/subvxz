Perfect! Man, it feels good

I can't believe your parents
chucked it on the front lawn.

00:16.771 --> 00:20.366
Yeah, but it was cool of the gardeners to help,
though. That guy with the leaf blower...

00:20.441 --> 00:23.274

Where are you gonna
put the rest of this crap?

put my clothes in the--

00:30.084 --> 00:33.212

00:33.287 --> 00:36.313

I hope one of those trash bags
has a maid in it.

00:43.864 --> 00:46.492
Mrs. H., I'm giving the room
a touch of Van.

00:46.567 --> 00:50.162
It's not a gentle touch, is it?

00:50.237 --> 00:52.432
- You wanna give me a hand here?
- What's that?

00:52.506 --> 00:56.408
My lucky comforter. Wildcat colors.
The orange and black attack.

00:56.477 --> 01:00.470

- Yeah. To help me get worked up.

01:17.865 --> 01:21.392

For the game.

- Certainly not implants.

See, the head cheerleader's
cheerin' me on. " Go, Van!''

01:36.951 --> 01:40.387
She really didn't say that,
but it's sort of like she did.

01:40.454 --> 01:44.515
You're gonna wish you had a bubble
over your head when your wife gets here.

01:44.592 --> 01:47.959
It's all right, Mrs. H.
Cheyenne knew I was bringin' my gear.

01:48.029 --> 01:50.259
- She wants me to feel at home.
- Van, listen to me.

01:50.331 --> 01:52.993
This isn't good.
I know my daughter.

01:53.067 --> 01:56.969
- She was moody before she was pregnant.
- Hey.

on the truck or the ones on the cheerleaders?

Sorry. I didn't mean

- Why is this in my living room?
- There's no room in the garage...

04:20.281 --> 04:22.249
and I figure this way,
everybody can use it.

04:22.316 --> 04:26.446
Plus, there's a good airflow,
so the sweat smell won't knock you out.

You know, Reba, sometimes
when life becomes chaotic...

14:18.812 --> 14:23.977
we tend to focus on controlling
the smaller issues to avoid the bigger issues.

14:24.050 --> 14:28.111
You know, this isn't the first time I've
been accused of this controlling thing...

14:28.188 --> 14:30.622
and, frankly, I'd like
to put a stop to it.

14:30.690 --> 14:33.318
I see.

14:33.393 --> 14:36.191
I mean, I was the one
that stuck by her.

14:36.262 --> 14:39.698
He wasn't even gonna come
to her wedding, which I planned myself.

14:39.766 --> 14:43.327
And don't get me started
on that Exer-cist in her bedroom.

14:45.505 --> 14:48.167
No matter what I do,
I get the blame.

14:48.241 --> 14:51.733
I should just let them
fend for themselves for a change.

14:51.811 --> 14:53.802
They'd fall flat on their face
in five minutes.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.646
- Or they'd learn to take care of themselves.
- [ Scoffs ] Fat chance.

14:57.717 --> 15:00.311
Well, you never know
until you give it a shot.

15:00.386 --> 15:03.480
So what do I do?

15:03.556 --> 15:05.990
- Nothing.
- Say again.

15:06.059 --> 15:09.995
Look, I know it's
a scary concept, but try it.

15:10.063 --> 15:14.432
- You're losing me.
- Take some time for yourself.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.994
Get a massage. Go to a movie.
Take up a hobby.

15:20.406 --> 15:22.738
Couldn't you just
write me a prescription instead?

15:25.578 --> 15:30.311
- So what did Mom say exactly?
- She said, " Feed your brother and sister.

15:30.383 --> 15:33.546
- I'm going to the movies.''
- She's lost it.

15:33.620 --> 15:37.579
- What are we going to eat?
- I don't know.

15:37.657 --> 15:40.751
There's, like,
nothing in here.

15:42.762 --> 15:46.163
- What's goin' on?
- So you're talking to me now?

15:46.232 --> 15:48.598
Only because I'm hungry.

15:50.436 --> 15:54.202
- Well, we're in a crisis, so go away.
- What's the crisis?

15:54.274 --> 15:59.678
- Mom bolted, so we have
to make dinner for ourselves.
- No way. What are we gonna eat?

15:59.746 --> 16:03.842
- You eat the most. Why
don't you make something?
- I can make chili.

16:03.917 --> 16:07.444
You got a can of chili?

16:07.520 --> 16:11.479
- We're all going to die.
- [ Cheyenne Grunts ]

16:11.557 --> 16:14.651
Do I have to
do everything myself?

16:16.195 --> 16:18.925
Daddy?

16:22.435 --> 16:25.893
- Pizza man.
- [Jake ] Yea!

16:25.972 --> 16:30.602
- Thank you, Daddy.
- I was this close to rolling Jake in a tortilla.

16:30.677 --> 16:32.975
Thanks, Coach.
Mmm. Onions.

16:33.046 --> 16:35.981
If you have any interest in kissing me
tonight, you will not eat those.

16:36.049 --> 16:39.382
Mmm. Onions.

16:42.155 --> 16:45.249
- So what's up with you two?
- We're having our first married fight.

16:45.325 --> 16:48.294
- It's awful.
- Honey, it was bound to happen sooner or later.

16:48.361 --> 16:52.263
- Yeah. That's what Mom said.
- Well, she should know.

16:52.332 --> 16:57.929
We had a thousand of those little fights,
and then, of course, the one big one.

16:58.004 --> 17:00.598
Well, the whole thing's
her fault anyway.

17:00.673 --> 17:04.074
I mean, I do not know how you lived
with her. She is such a control freak.

17:04.143 --> 17:06.134
Tell me about it.
I got lists up the wazoo.

17:06.212 --> 17:09.238
She's constantly interfering,
telling people what to do.

17:09.315 --> 17:12.944
- Or what not to do.
- It's no wonder she drove you away, Dad.

17:16.856 --> 17:20.291
Say, listen. Could you guys take your pizza
and eat it in the living room?

17:20.359 --> 17:22.624
Mom doesn't let us eat
in the living room.

17:22.694 --> 17:25.755
- Well, she's not here.
- Cool!

17:25.832 --> 17:28.767
No, no, no.
Wait a second.

17:28.835 --> 17:33.636
If that's the rule,
then... use napkins.

17:33.706 --> 17:37.802
And give yourself a time-out
after you've finished.

17:41.347 --> 17:44.043
Cheyenne, honey,
you got it all wrong.

17:44.117 --> 17:48.349
- Your mama didn't drive me away.
- Dad, it's me. You don't have to defend her.

17:48.421 --> 17:51.948
Sweetheart, I'm not the easiest guy
to get along with.

17:52.025 --> 17:54.721
You know, the fact that your mama stayed
with me as long as she did...

17:54.794 --> 17:57.024
shows just how amazing
she really is.

17:57.096 --> 18:02.796
- I can't believe you said that.
- Look, I know she can be tough sometimes...

18:02.869 --> 18:06.669
but... I've always admired
the way she speaks her mind.

18:08.875 --> 18:12.311
[ Sighs ]
Then what happened with you guys?

18:12.378 --> 18:17.179
Well, we had
some little problems.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.981
And little problems become big problems
when you don't communicate, and...

18:21.054 --> 18:23.522
that's not exactly
my strong point.

18:23.589 --> 18:27.286
- Yeah. That's what Mom said.
- Oh, yeah. Like she's perfect.

18:39.238 --> 18:42.230
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:42.308 --> 18:45.471
So, uh,
when did you get home?

18:45.545 --> 18:48.981
A little while ago.

18:49.048 --> 18:52.677
It's nice out here.

18:52.752 --> 18:56.347
- So how was the movie?
- Good.

18:56.422 --> 19:00.222
Did you know the last time I went
to see a movie was beforeJake was born?

19:02.995 --> 19:06.192
They're a lot louder now.

19:06.265 --> 19:10.929
- So how'd you guys make out tonight?
- Okay.

19:11.003 --> 19:13.028
Dad brought pizza.

19:15.441 --> 19:19.901
- We also talked.
- That's nice.

19:19.979 --> 19:24.313
Mom, he made me
realize...

19:24.383 --> 19:27.546
that... I was wrong...

19:27.620 --> 19:29.884
about a lot of things.

19:29.956 --> 19:33.483
I am so sorry about the horrible thing
that I said to you.

19:33.559 --> 19:37.154
You have every right
to kill me if you want to.

19:37.230 --> 19:41.132
Wow. There really is something
to this " doin' nothin'.''

19:41.200 --> 19:46.570
- What does that mean?
- Well, I had a little talk
with someone today myself.

19:46.639 --> 19:50.006
- Course, my talk cost me 80 bucks.
- What'd you learn?

19:50.076 --> 19:55.946
That you and Van are married now, and that
I have to let you make your own mistakes.

19:56.015 --> 19:59.610
That's how you're gonna learn.
So no more interferin'.

20:03.022 --> 20:08.756
Sometimes, the best thing I can do
for the two of you is nothin' at all.

20:11.764 --> 20:14.790
- I love you, Mom.
- Ohh.

20:16.235 --> 20:19.568
- But you're still gonna do laundry, right?
- [ Scoffs ]

20:21.874 --> 20:24.069
No.

20:31.684 --> 20:33.982
So when you wanna look at it,
just open the door...

20:34.053 --> 20:36.851
and the rest of the time,
keep it shut.

20:36.923 --> 20:39.949
That's gonna work great.
We have an awesome marriage.

20:40.026 --> 20:44.326
I know. But remember,
this honesty thing works both ways...

20:44.397 --> 20:47.594
so if there's ever anything that I do
that bothers you, you can tell me, okay?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.965
Okay.

20:50.036 --> 20:53.437
Well, I kinda wasn't
gonna say anything, but...

20:53.506 --> 20:56.304
I kinda wish you wouldn't
put that potpourri stuff in my underwear.

20:58.010 --> 21:01.707
I went through a whole practice
with an acorn in my jockstrap.

21:01.781 --> 21:05.114
- I didn't do that.
- Well, then who did?

21:09.755 --> 21:13.657
I've been under a lot of stress.
