WEBVTT

00:08.591 --> 00:13.930
Pulled over by the cops 20 minutes after
we gave you the Vista Cruiser?

00:14.014 --> 00:16.766
Who could have pulled off
something like that?

00:17.350 --> 00:22.063
Only a criminal mastermind
without the mind.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.233
A Kelso.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.445
Trouble just follows them, honey.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.031
They're like those frogs
in the rainforest.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.240
Colorful and pretty,

00:32.323 --> 00:35.702
but if you lick them,
all your skin falls off and you die.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.621
I'm sorry, but can we just stop
for a second?

00:38.705 --> 00:41.499
Because how cute is this
that we are holding hands?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.376
It finally happened, you guys!

00:44.669 --> 00:47.797
Grandpa, I know this looks bad,
but we only got pulled over

00:47.881 --> 00:50.300
because the car had
license plates from 1980.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.052
She's right, Mr. Forman.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.846
Sometimes, if you're searching for blame,

00:54.929 --> 00:56.264
it's best to look inward.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.809
My foot's about to go inward your ass.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.104
You can't set him up like that.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.274
I know we're off to a rough start,
but give me a chance.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.694
Someday, this frog
is gonna turn into a butterfly.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.822
I'm getting stupider standing here.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.202
You are banned from this house. Get out.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.536
What? No!

01:20.497 --> 01:22.123
Honey. Honey.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.416
Let go of the frog.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.002
-<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:37.138 --> 01:39.682
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:41.810
The Kool-Aid Man?

01:42.477 --> 01:44.104
<i>That's</i> the tattoo you wanna get?

01:44.187 --> 01:45.855
The key is to not overthink it.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.690
Mission accomplished.

01:48.399 --> 01:52.028
Jay, I miss you, and I feel so bad
you can't be here for all the fun.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.822
Gwen and Ozzie are talking.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.323
Nikki's chewing gum.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.534
And Nate's adjusting his junk.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.077
You need more powder, babe.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.038
Summer's the worst season for your junk.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.040
Hey. Can I talk to him?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.085
Just come over, bro.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.462
Leia's grandma's at the dentist.
Red's stuck at the DMV.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.548
Damn it. I miss you too.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.801
-He's coming over.
-He is?

02:14.884 --> 02:16.427
I gotta shave my pits!

02:16.511 --> 02:17.762
<i>Uh, what?</i>

02:17.846 --> 02:19.889
That was Nikki. Bye!

02:21.015 --> 02:22.725
Gwen. Help me.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.770
Boyfriend, day one.

02:26.396 --> 02:27.897
Oh, I gotta take off too.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.066
I'm meeting my SAT tutor in 20 minutes.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.192
Again with that guy?

02:31.276 --> 02:34.863
But you're already so smart.
You helped me escape from that trampoline.

02:34.946 --> 02:39.242
Babe, I need to ace the SATs,
get into a good college, cure a disease,

02:39.325 --> 02:41.995
and have my face on a stamp
so my enemies can lick it.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.710
She's spending a lot of time
with that tutor guy.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.170
Is someone feeling jealous?

02:50.253 --> 02:51.963
No, I am.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.884
I mean, she's with this guy all the time.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.928
Do you think I have
anything to worry about?

02:59.804 --> 03:03.141
Tough to answer without knowing
who the guy is, but, knowing you,

03:04.309 --> 03:05.143
maybe.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.353
I know, right?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.647
If it's really bothering you,
let's check this guy out.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.233
Nah, I should just trust her.

03:12.317 --> 03:16.863
Nate, I watch a lot of talk shows,
and I've learned two things.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.531
People cheat.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.201
And once a ho, always a ho.

03:26.956 --> 03:27.957
I'm so happy you're here.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.920
It's gonna be okay.
Take three steps forward.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.463
I can't. What if Red comes home?

03:33.546 --> 03:35.381
He is just being smart, Gwen.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.550
Smart and hot and brave.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.803
-I'm not scared of somebody's grandpa.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.182
Holy hell! I was just
trying to scooch by ya,

03:44.265 --> 03:48.102
not scare the Milk Duds
out of all of us.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.480
Hi, Ms. Runck.
Sorry, but my grandma's not home.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.858
I know. I gotta pick her up at the dentist
soon because she's gonna be zonked.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.736
But I thought I'd pop over first
and do a little grocery shoppin'.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.572
So much easier than going
all the way down to the store, ya know?

03:59.656 --> 04:00.990
Mom!

04:01.574 --> 04:03.701
-Grab me some yogurts.
-Oh.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.080
Oh, you know it's the beginning
of a relationship

04:07.163 --> 04:09.415
when the guy still goes outside
to cut the cheese.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.293
Jay, just come in.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.421
-I missed you so much.
-Missed you too.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.298
What? He just get back
from Iraq or something?

04:18.091 --> 04:21.469
They've been apart for one day.
Her grandpa banned him from the house.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.097
Sounds like Red's being
a hard-ass like my dad.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.932
He never believed in me.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.268
Sometimes I wonder
if that might've screwed me up.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.352
No.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.897
Aw, that's nice, hon,
but I really think he did.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.193
The point is, adults should be
more understanding. You know?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.488
I mean, just throwing rules out at kids
is not the answer.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.490
So you'll sign off on me getting a tattoo?

04:42.991 --> 04:43.866
Sorry, lady.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.411
I'm fine with you making mistakes,
but not permanent ones.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.831
Tattoos, babies, and DUIs,
the unholy trinity.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.667
Wait, isn't the dentist
like five minutes away?

04:52.750 --> 04:54.794
Jay, why don't <i>we </i>go pick up my grandma?

04:54.877 --> 04:57.338
I know this isn't
the sexiest thing I've ever said,

04:58.089 --> 04:59.966
but I'm pretty sure
your grandpa can kick my ass.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.720
But it would show him
how responsible you are.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.264
Yeah, and while you're at it,
you gotta let Red know

05:06.347 --> 05:08.141
that you're tired of him judging ya.

05:08.224 --> 05:12.103
And still, to this day,
making you feel unworthy, disrespected,

05:12.186 --> 05:14.022
and like you're not a good mom!

05:15.606 --> 05:17.692
I feel like that wasn't all about us.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.902
We have to try something.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.154
Can we borrow your car?

05:21.654 --> 05:23.781
Don't know if I should get
between you and your grandpa.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.409
-We'll fill it up with gas.
-Here's my keys.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.871
I'll stay here
and finish up my grocery shopping.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.082
I know you're worried,
but all we have to do

05:33.166 --> 05:34.876
is pick up my sweet, sedated grandma.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.300
Your turn!

05:47.930 --> 05:48.765
Big finish!

05:51.184 --> 05:53.061
Gwen, stop encouraging her!

05:53.144 --> 05:54.645
But this is fun.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.148
She's high as a kite that's also on drugs.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.069
Grandma, can you please just chill out?

06:01.152 --> 06:03.196
Boo!

06:03.279 --> 06:06.783
-Yeah. Yeah. Boo!
-Boo!

06:07.450 --> 06:11.120
-Wait. We just passed a tattoo shop. Stop!
-Forget it, Gwen.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.916
My only job is to get her home safe.
Okay? I'm not stopping for anything.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.793
-Red light!

06:22.006 --> 06:23.966
-Come on.

06:24.050 --> 06:24.884
This is my chance.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.387
Your grandma's out of it.
She'll sign the release.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.641
Right, Mrs. Forman?
You want me to get a tattoo, don't you?

06:31.724 --> 06:35.978
Yeah. And then let's steal a boat
and go to Vegas.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.398
No. We're going home,
we're putting Grandma to bed,

06:38.481 --> 06:41.859
and we're showing my grandpa
that Jay is a responsible human being.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.830
-Guess who?
-Oh my God!

06:53.913 --> 06:55.498
-Oh my God!

06:55.581 --> 06:56.999
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

06:59.752 --> 07:00.586
We'll be quick.

07:02.088 --> 07:02.964
Later, nerds.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.303
Nik?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.139
What?!

07:11.222 --> 07:12.306
You?! Here?!

07:12.390 --> 07:13.724
I mean, whoa!

07:13.808 --> 07:16.769
Now? How? What? Weird!

07:17.270 --> 07:18.688
I told you I was gonna be here.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.440
Right. Right, with your tutor.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.068
I totally forgot about him. Where is he?

07:24.152 --> 07:27.029
Oh, Trevor? Here he comes.

07:37.582 --> 07:41.085
Holy sh--

07:44.297 --> 07:46.048
Trevor, this is my boyfriend, Nate.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.758
"Boyfriend"?

07:47.842 --> 07:51.596
More like "manfriend."
I can't grow any hair on my face,

07:51.679 --> 07:54.348
but from the waist down,
it is wall-to-wall carpeting.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.018
And I'm Ozzie.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.605
My pediatrician said I'll be 6'2".

08:01.397 --> 08:03.774
-Oh. I've heard a lot about you.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.485
Nikki tells me
you're on the football team?

08:05.568 --> 08:06.944
Yeah, but we couldn't do it

08:07.028 --> 08:09.489
without guys like you
in the stands cheering us on. So…

08:09.572 --> 08:12.700
Actually, Trevor got
a football scholarship to Notre Dame.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.785
Not that he needs it.
His dad's a congressman.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.829
God bless America.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.123
Well, this is fun.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.000
And normal.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.545
Thanks for stopping by, but we really
need to get back to studying.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.216
Oh yeah. Super busy day on our end too.

08:28.299 --> 08:32.470
Ozzie's… lizard is sick,
and I have to help with the pills.

08:34.263 --> 08:35.556
They go in the butt.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.267
Okay, cool.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.561
Nice to meet you, Nate.
Nice to meet you, Ozzie.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.104
I'm 25.

08:47.026 --> 08:47.860
You're screwed.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.281
What's taking so long?

08:52.865 --> 08:55.326
Aw, we said that at the same time.
We're adorable.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.620
I can't do adorable right now.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.163
If your grandpa beats us home…

08:59.664 --> 09:01.374
-He's…
-Gonna kill us.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.584
Okay, that was cute.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.380
Finally.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.590
-Let's see it.
-Oh, I bailed on the tattoo.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.842
Some lady cut in front of me,
and it was taking forever.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.970
I got a tattoo!

09:16.347 --> 09:17.348
To Vegas!

09:21.852 --> 09:23.020
So I was right.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.439
That Trevor dude is
obviously trying to seduce Nikki.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.733
I don't think he needs to try very hard.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.404
How am I gonna save my relationship?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.281
He's hot. He's smart.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.116
He doesn't owe Nikki 70 bucks.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.494
I got it.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.621
I'll go kick his ass. Duh!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.498
So you're the "let's bring him out" guy.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.416
The what guy?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.376
There's one on every talk show.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.337
The host says, "Let's bring him out."

09:48.421 --> 09:49.589
Everyone boos.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.008
Then he says, "You don't know me."

09:54.135 --> 09:56.053
Have you never seen a talk show?

09:57.138 --> 10:01.100
-Ozzie! Ozzie! Ozzie!

10:01.183 --> 10:03.102
Welcome back!

10:03.185 --> 10:06.397
Today, we have Nikki and Trevor.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.857
Aww!

10:07.940 --> 10:09.692
They may look like the perfect couple,

10:10.985 --> 10:13.195
but somebody has a problem with that.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.615
Let's bring him out.

10:17.199 --> 10:18.492
Boo!

10:18.576 --> 10:21.412
Hey, you don't know me! You don't know me!

10:22.955 --> 10:24.040
Nate.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.792
Why don't you tell us
what's gotten you so upset?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.588
That's my girlfriend,
and now she's hanging out with this chump,

10:30.671 --> 10:32.506
and suddenly I'm not good enough for her.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.424
Nikki?

10:33.507 --> 10:37.928
Nate's fine, but… Trevor stimulates
my mind <i>and</i> my body.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.430
-Both?!

10:39.513 --> 10:40.598
That's impossible!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.266
Not for me.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.895
Nate, stop.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.190
I'm done playing around.
Nik, you need to make a choice.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.525
Is it him? Or is it me?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.693
Oh, then him.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.445
This guy?!

10:54.528 --> 10:55.696
You don't know him.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.823
You don't know him.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.120
Shut up! You don't know me!

11:03.204 --> 11:05.456
-You don't know me!

11:07.708 --> 11:08.709
Nobody knows you.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.504
Stop saying that.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.843
I need to talk to Nikki.

11:18.678 --> 11:22.056
-And what are you gonna say to her?
-This is getting weird, dude.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.141
We'll be right back.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.398
A tattoo?!

11:30.481 --> 11:33.234
I don't even wear waterproof mascara.

11:33.818 --> 11:34.819
Red's gonna kill me.

11:34.902 --> 11:35.903
Gwen.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.824
I know. But I stopped her
from getting a barbed wire tramp stamp.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.367
So you're welcome.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.705
Grandma, I am so sorry.
None of this was supposed to happen.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.081
How are you cooking dinner now?

11:47.164 --> 11:51.585
It is helping me deal with the stress
of waking up with a flipping tattoo!

11:52.503 --> 11:53.504
What's the emergency?

11:53.587 --> 11:56.132
D'you run out of eggs?
'Cause I don't know how that happened.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.175
Look what happened at the dentist.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.761
Holy crapola!

12:00.845 --> 12:04.265
I heard of them feeling you up
when you're out, but this crosses a line.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.809
My mother would be rolling in her grave,

12:06.892 --> 12:08.978
if we hadn't spread her ashes

12:09.061 --> 12:11.856
in the parking lot
of the Sizzler by her church.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.233
Did you get one too?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.444
You've been talking nonstop about tatties.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.196
No. You told me not to get one,
and I always follow what you tell me.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.324
Good. Those things are
a one-way ticket to whore town.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.244
Sorry.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.080
Are you sure there is no way
to get this off?

12:28.164 --> 12:31.041
Is there a… a special cream or something?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.794
If there was I wouldn't have
Fred Flintstone riding a surfboard

12:33.878 --> 12:35.004
on my hip bone.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.843
That's Red.
Good Lord, what is he gonna think?

12:40.926 --> 12:42.803
Oh man, he's gonna be pissed.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.681
Stomp around,
probably take away my allowance.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.103
Sorry. It's a Dad flashback.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.980
You need to get out of here.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.357
No, I'm not leaving you here
to take the blame.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.693
Cool. If he has
the blame thing covered, I'm out.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.195
Hang on.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.031
Take these. We're low on fresh produce.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.367
Don't let Grandpa see your wrist

13:05.451 --> 13:07.244
until we figure out
the best way to tell him.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.873
I do not keep things from my husband.
He is a reasonable man.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.965
Down in hell,
there's this little room in the wayback

13:20.049 --> 13:23.594
where the devil craps fire
into your mouth.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.099
That's the DMV.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.145
How was your day, dear?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.773
Oh, it was just… It was…

13:37.233 --> 13:38.692
It… It was great.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.446
Just, like, nothing crazy happened.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.074
And what's he doing here?

13:45.157 --> 13:46.075
Um…

13:46.158 --> 13:49.537
He brought Grandma the chicken.
From his garden.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.621
Yes.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.122
I was making supper.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.877
I… I have to get up inside there.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.921
Oh yeah.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.006
This is gonna be yummy.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.469
Wanna take that chicken off your hand?

14:06.846 --> 14:07.680
I do not.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.977
I'm gonna go get the laundry now.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.531
I am so disappointed in you.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.366
All of you.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.328
But especially you, little Kelso.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.581
I was wrong the other day.

14:33.664 --> 14:37.418
You are a complete waste
of a foot in the ass.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.087
You never even gave him a chance.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.340
You decided based on his last name
that you were going to hate him.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.466
This is so unfair.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.594
And that's what makes it fun for me.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.095
Leia, he's right.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.516
It is my fault, sir.
I was the one driving.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.728
Look, I'm not proud of what happened,

14:55.811 --> 14:59.773
but I do believe the mistakes we make
are what turn us into the men we become.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.861
And I would like to become a man
worthy of dating your granddaughter.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.156
-Get out.
-Already gone.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.199
And you, go to your room.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.289
Red, don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.833
Yeah, they made a mistake,
but nobody got hurt.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.879
My wife is tatted up
like she's doing time at Rikers.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.423
I'm starting to like it.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.384
I feel like Rizzo from <i>Grease</i>.

15:29.386 --> 15:33.974
All I asked you to do
was to give Kitty a simple ride home.

15:34.058 --> 15:39.146
But you pawned it off on the kids
and turned it into a circus.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.231
Like everything in your life.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.192
You know what?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.027
Screw you.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.905
You're such a blowhard.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.199
You know how many years
I spent getting yelled at,

15:50.282 --> 15:52.493
being told how much I messed up?

15:52.576 --> 15:56.372
So you don't have to respect me,
because I finally respect myself.

15:56.455 --> 16:00.042
And I don't have to stand here
while you yell at me anymore.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.546
And thanks a lot for never teaching me
how to ride a bike!

16:07.549 --> 16:09.218
Do I look like her father?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.309
I brought you a little treat.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.021
-What's with her?
-Oh, Red.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.982
Leia is a teenager.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.527
She's bursting with hormones
and bad decisions.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.362
I was talking about Sherri.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.907
Well, she's bursting with hormones
and bad decisions too.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.535
I mean…

16:34.618 --> 16:39.456
If she has issues with her father,
let her go and yell at him.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.499
Yeah.

16:40.582 --> 16:45.087
It's not great when people blame you
for other people's problems.

16:49.049 --> 16:49.883
What?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.385
Jay is not his father.

16:52.636 --> 16:56.181
He could have run off,
let Leia take all the blame.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.727
But you saw how he stood up for her
and took responsibility.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.562
Michael Kelso would never have done that.

17:01.645 --> 17:05.482
Michael Kelso glued himself
to our refrigerator.

17:06.692 --> 17:09.236
I think you're setting the bar kinda low.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.364
Well, look, Red. I'm guilty of it too.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.408
Leia's right.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
We never really did give Jay a chance.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
-Oh, oh, oh, oh!

17:20.873 --> 17:24.877
I know that sound.
It means you're starting to come around.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.589
While you're a little open-minded…

17:29.214 --> 17:30.049
Do you hate it?

17:31.091 --> 17:32.926
Well, actually…

17:33.010 --> 17:36.221
-It's kind of adventurous.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.225
Oh!

17:40.309 --> 17:42.186
I know what you're in the mood for.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.812
Yeah.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.607
Yeah!

17:52.529 --> 17:53.530
Hey, babe.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.701
Are you okay?

17:57.785 --> 18:00.454
You didn't squeeze my butt
and say, "Hey, ladies."

18:01.497 --> 18:04.541
Nik, I'm kind of freaking out about us.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.211
-You've been spending time with Trevor--
-Trevor?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.671
Nate, there's nothing
between me and Trevor.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.340
You know I don't like muscular guys.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.219
I don't know how I feel about that, but…

18:15.886 --> 18:19.181
It's not just him.
It's all this other stuff.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.933
The SATs, the studying.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.603
I'm afraid you're gonna leave me behind.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.022
Nate, I'm not going to college
to leave you behind.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.275
I'm… I'm going to college
so I can have a future.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.736
Am I in that future?

18:33.320 --> 18:34.613
Well, the future's not set.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.449
There's no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.993
You're hot <i>and </i>you quote <i>Terminator 2!</i>

18:41.703 --> 18:43.872
I can't imagine not being with you.

18:45.415 --> 18:47.876
I need you to tell me
we're always gonna be together.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.670
Hey, come here.

18:52.339 --> 18:56.260
Babe, I don't know what's gonna happen.
All I know is that I love you.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.428
And I hope that's enough.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.722
It is.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.855
-Feeling better?
-Yeah.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.732
Hello, ladies.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.444
Okay, well I have to head home for dinner.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.281
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.700
-Yeah, totally.
-Okay.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.376
Hey there.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.087
Listen, kiddo. I've been thinking.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.965
If you really want to see this Kelso kid,

19:36.675 --> 19:37.718
I'll give him a chance.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.761
Really?

19:40.762 --> 19:43.724
But you gotta be careful.
No more joyrides.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.768
And he's not allowed upstairs. Fair?

19:47.769 --> 19:50.647
So fair. I'll tell Jay everything
the next time I see him.

19:50.731 --> 19:51.732
Uh-huh.

19:57.863 --> 19:58.864
Already gone.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.200
Bye, babe!

20:01.283 --> 20:02.576
Aww!

20:08.081 --> 20:10.292
I talked to Kitty, and I gotta tell ya,

20:11.126 --> 20:12.336
I know you're not my dad.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.756
For one thing, you're alive.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.842
And also you're not a jerk.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.848
Well, uh, are we here to chat or…
or learn?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.934
Now… like we practiced.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.561
My balance is probably pretty good

20:29.645 --> 20:32.439
from all those times
I walked home drunk in high heels.

20:33.815 --> 20:36.109
Oh, I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

20:36.193 --> 20:38.528
All right, there you go. Now turn around.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.529
Hey, I'm doing it.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.656
Good job.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.451
-Now, brake. Okay, now brake.
-Oh, whoa!

20:45.619 --> 20:46.828
You idiot!

20:46.912 --> 20:48.413
Don't worry. I'm okay.
