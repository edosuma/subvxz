Hello?

01:32.660 --> 01:34.290
Dad, I'm calling
about the school
talent show...

01:34.360 --> 01:35.990
Don't worry.
I know it's tonight.

01:36.060 --> 01:37.230
No. Dad,
I broke my last

01:37.290 --> 01:38.790
saxophone reed

01:38.860 --> 01:40.400
and I need you to
get me a new one.

01:40.460 --> 01:43.120
Isn't this the kind of thing
your mother's better at?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.100
I called her.
She's not home.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.540
I also tried Mr. Flanders,
Aunt Patty, Aunt Selma, Doctor
Hibbert, Reverend Lovejoy

01:48.600 --> 01:52.630
and that nice man who caught
the snake in our basement.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.050
Wow. And after them

01:54.110 --> 01:56.650
out of all the people
in the world

01:56.710 --> 01:57.780
you chose me.

01:57.850 --> 01:58.950
Uh-huh.

01:59.010 --> 02:01.410
Number 4 1/2 reed. Got it.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.350
Well, you're in for
a whale of a show tonight.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.360
I'd like to point out that
the doors are now locked,
so you parents

02:07.420 --> 02:08.449
can't sneak out
of the show

02:08.520 --> 02:10.889
after your own child
has performed.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.600
Oh, and let me
caution the people
in the first five rows--

02:13.660 --> 02:15.690
you <i>will get wet.</i>

02:18.470 --> 02:20.000

02:23.670 --> 02:25.400
( <i>smacking lips )</i>

02:25.470 --> 02:28.740
Hurry. Moe, hurry.
I've only got five minutes
till the music store closes.

02:28.810 --> 02:30.150
Well why don't you
go there first?

02:30.210 --> 02:31.310
Hey, do I tell you
how to do <i>your job?</i>

02:31.380 --> 02:33.220
Sorry, Homer.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.690
You know, if you tip the glass,
there won't be so much
foam on top,

02:35.750 --> 02:36.690
Sorry, Homer.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.180
( <i>feeble applause )</i>

02:42.260 --> 02:44.360
This is a whole lot

02:44.430 --> 02:46.500
I'd rather be watchin'
the boilers.

02:46.560 --> 02:50.200
Make sure you return
those chairs to the cafeteria,
Kim.

02:50.270 --> 02:50.900
I'm not kidding.

02:52.670 --> 02:55.610

03:02.080 --> 03:03.920
What's the matter, buddy?

03:03.980 --> 03:06.180
The moron next door
closed early.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.550
I happen to <i>be that moron.</i>

03:16.830 --> 03:19.100
Oh, terrible,
just terrible.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.370
They seem to get worse
every year.

03:21.430 --> 03:22.270
Ha, ha, ha!

03:22.330 --> 03:24.300
Wonderful!

03:24.370 --> 03:27.270
You know, I think this is the
best batch we've ever had.
I really do.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.570
And now, here's Bart Simpson

03:28.640 --> 03:31.580
the boy
of a thousand voices.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.380
I'd like to open

Principal Skinner.

( <i>dopey voice: )
Duh, look at me.</i>

03:43.920 --> 03:45.290
I'm Principal Skinner.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.150
( <i>kids cheering )</i>

03:47.220 --> 03:48.720
That young man
just became

03:48.790 --> 03:51.160
the boy of a thousand days
detention.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.470
Hey, it's Lunch Lady Doris.
I wonder what she's
got for us today.

to open that store.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.000
Let me think about it.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.750
Uh... no.

04:08.810 --> 04:11.750
Okay, but I want you
to see a picture

04:11.810 --> 04:14.680
of the little girl
you're disappointing.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.019
Well, I don't have one.

04:16.079 --> 04:16.880
Come on, Jer.

04:16.950 --> 04:18.760
Open up. Be a pal.

04:18.820 --> 04:21.560
Remember when I pulled
you and your wife out of
that burning car?

04:21.620 --> 04:23.580
Okay, okay,
but now we're even.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.730
What does your daughter need?

04:25.790 --> 04:27.060
I'll have you know
I wrote it down.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.630
"Number...
number 4 1/2..."

04:29.700 --> 04:31.000
Stupid gum!

04:31.070 --> 04:32.670
"Number 4 1/2 reed."

04:32.730 --> 04:34.200
Whoo-hoo!

04:34.270 --> 04:36.670
Mm-hmm. And,
what instrument
does she play?

04:36.740 --> 04:38.880
I don't know.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.750
Mom, where is he?

04:44.810 --> 04:47.680
If I don't get that reed,
I'll sound terrible.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.020
Don't worry, honey.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.210
I'm sure your father is...

04:51.290 --> 04:54.030
<i>maybe...</i>

04:54.090 --> 04:55.890
<i>No.</i>

<i>That's a long shot.</i>

04:58.630 --> 05:01.370
<i>Bingo.</i>

05:01.430 --> 05:02.500
Don't worry.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.390
He'll be here.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.840
Clarinet? Oboe?
No.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.170
Saxophone?
No.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.470
Wait a minute.
What was that last one again?

05:07.540 --> 05:08.440
Saxophone.

Hmm...

It's not my fault.

It's the reed.

Oh, yes, of course.

It's the reed.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.180
Okay, who ordered
a Mount Bellyache?

06:29.250 --> 06:31.860
I ordered it
for my little girl.

I'm done.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.860
Oh! That cost $88!

I'm sorry, Dad.
I don't feel much like eating.

06:39.590 --> 06:42.160
Look, I let you down
and I apologize.

06:42.230 --> 06:44.770
I know that
doesn't make it right.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.930
But I hope you can
find it in your heart
to forgive me.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.370
I forgive you.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.140
D-ohhh!
You didn't mean that.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.680
No, I didn't.

to make up with Lisa

just spend some

Maybe I should just
cut my losses,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.470

07:57.540 --> 07:59.980
Homie, you've got to
stop looking for the quick fix.

If you keep spending time
with Lisa, she'll forgive you.

Marge, if I spend any more time
doing these girl things

08:06.450 --> 08:08.720
I'm going to, you know,
go fruity.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.980
No, you were right

Let's see--
quick fix, quick fix.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.520
Ahh.. I'll buy her that pony
she's always bugging me for.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.420
We can't afford
to buy a pony.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.300
Marge, with today's
gasoline prices, we can't
afford <i>not to buy a pony.</i>

08:23.370 --> 08:24.570
That's ridiculous.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.560
Marge, I've gotta
get her a pony.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.510
When I look in Lisa's eyes
I don't see love anymore

08:28.570 --> 08:30.640
That's no reason
to buy a pony.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.309
See, even when you yell at me,
I can see love in <i>your eyes.</i>

08:33.380 --> 08:34.710

08:37.049 --> 08:38.350
Let's be realistic.

08:38.409 --> 08:40.679
A pony is very expensive.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.390
and we have enough trouble
paying bills as it is.

08:42.450 --> 08:44.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Promise me you won't.

Hmm.

08:47.890 --> 08:49.630

Was that a yes or a no?

08:49.690 --> 08:50.460
Baa.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.940
Oh, it's you.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.270
Excuse me.

09:04.340 --> 09:05.540
Do you sell ponies?

09:05.610 --> 09:07.410
Sure, pal.
Right here.

"Scottish Deer Hound."

Hey, this is a dog.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.520
Ooh my friend, you're smarter
than I gave you credit for.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.960
I suggest you try the Boney Farm
on Route 401.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.660
Merely take a left
at the rendering plant.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.870
Homer:
Now lady, I'm buying a pony
for my little girl

09:30.930 --> 09:32.160
and I don't care
what it costs.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.590
Very good.

09:33.670 --> 09:35.170
That stunning creature
over there

09:35.240 --> 09:36.570
is half a million dollars.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.480
Half a million dollars?!

09:38.540 --> 09:40.580
He was sired by Seattle Slew.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.400
and his mother won
the Kentucky Derby.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.410
His likeness

09:43.480 --> 09:45.750
graces a stamp in Tanzania.

09:45.810 --> 09:46.670
I'll take it!

09:46.750 --> 09:48.650
Mr. Simpson, do you have

09:48.720 --> 09:50.720
half a million dollars?

09:50.790 --> 09:53.960
Sure, let me write you
a check.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.660
Mr. Simpson

09:58.730 --> 10:02.700
this check is dated
January 1, 2054.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.630
Is there a problem
with that?

10:04.700 --> 10:07.940
Our ponies start
at $5,000... cash.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.410
Isn't there like a pound

10:11.470 --> 10:13.030
where you can pick up
cheap ponies

10:13.110 --> 10:14.010
that ran away from home?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.580
I sincerely hope not.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.380
Homer:
<i>I'd like</i>

10:20.450 --> 10:21.920
to borrow $5,000.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.510
Sorry.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.590
I can't approve
a loan that size myself.
( rings bell )

10:27.090 --> 10:27.860
Hello.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.580
( <i>scream )</i>

10:28.660 --> 10:29.860
"Simpson." eh?

10:29.930 --> 10:31.700
How can I help you?

10:31.760 --> 10:33.460
Mr. Burns,
you do this personally?

10:33.530 --> 10:35.130
It's a hobby.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.440
I'm not in this
for any personal gain.
Heavens no.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.010
By the way, are you
acquainted with our
state's stringent usury laws?

10:41.070 --> 10:41.710
Usury?

10:41.770 --> 10:43.070
Silly me.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.040
I must've just made up
a word that doesn't exist.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.180
Now, what is the purpose
of this loan?

10:47.240 --> 10:48.780
I want to buy a pony.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.200
Isn't that cute?

10:50.280 --> 10:53.120
Smithers, he's planning
on joining the horsey set.

10:53.180 --> 10:54.790
That is it, isn't it?

10:54.850 --> 10:57.050
You're not planning to eat it?

10:57.120 --> 10:59.920
No I need to get it
for my little girl because
she doesn't love me anymore.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.290
Shut up, Simpson.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.190
You have any collateral?

11:03.260 --> 11:05.500
Oh, Smithers,
let's not be so cold.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.970
His spirit
is my collateral.

11:09.030 --> 11:12.340
Just sign this form
and the money will be yours.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.110
( <i>diabolical laughter )</i>

11:14.170 --> 11:16.240
Sorry, I was just thinking

11:16.300 --> 11:18.900
of something funny
Smithers did today.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.470
I didn't do anything
funny, Sir.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.010
Shut up.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.750
Mr. Simpson

11:25.810 --> 11:29.990
are you quite sure you know
how to take care of a pony?

11:30.070 --> 11:31.540
Of course.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.030
Simpson, you've done it again.

11:46.150 --> 11:50.160
( <i>screaming )</i>

11:56.460 --> 11:59.130
I love you, Dad!

12:00.230 --> 12:02.400
Mmmmm.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.710
I am very upset with you.

12:04.770 --> 12:06.470
Sounds like someone's
angling

12:06.540 --> 12:08.540
for a pony of her own.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.310
( <i>gasping )</i>

12:10.380 --> 12:12.750
How come Lisa gets a pony?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.050
Because she
stopped loving me.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.150
I don't love ya' either,
so gimme a moped.

12:16.210 --> 12:20.280
I know you love me,
so you don't get squat.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.660
Snowball II,
Santa's little helper--

12:22.720 --> 12:24.460
this is Princess.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.420
Please don't exclude her
because she's different.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.620
Homer, just where were you
planning to keep this horse?

12:33.700 --> 12:35.270
I've got it
all figured out.

12:35.330 --> 12:38.300
By day, it will roam free
around the neighborhood

12:38.370 --> 12:40.470
and at night,
it will nestle snugly

12:40.540 --> 12:42.510
between the cars
in our garage.

12:42.570 --> 12:43.830
Dad, no!

12:43.910 --> 12:45.080
That's illegal.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.300
That's for the courts
to decide.

12:47.380 --> 12:48.850
Marge, she loves me.

12:48.910 --> 12:52.440
Dad, I think Princess
belongs in a stable.

12:52.520 --> 12:53.450
Stable?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.190
That sounds expensive.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.820
This is what love costs
a month?

12:57.890 --> 13:00.900
These are standard
stable fees,
Mr. Simpson.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.030
Plus, I'm teaching your daughter
riding, grooming

13:04.100 --> 13:07.200
and at no extra charge,
pronunciation.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.300
( <i>with British accent:)
Father, you've made me the
happiest girl who ever lived.</i>

13:10.370 --> 13:12.240
Oh, nuts.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.410
?

13:14.470 --> 13:15.770
Grampa, if you want
to go right

13:15.840 --> 13:16.980
move the joy stick to the left.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.550
Yes. Move the...

13:18.610 --> 13:20.380
What's a joy stick?
You didn't tell me--

13:20.450 --> 13:22.750
Oh, oh!
Here comes a Xylon cruiser!
Woah, woah woah!

13:22.810 --> 13:24.340
Go into hyperspace!
Ready, hit it!

13:24.420 --> 13:26.950
Wait!
Where's the hyperspace?

13:27.020 --> 13:28.360
Grampa, you're the spaceship,
not the--

13:28.420 --> 13:30.320
I thought I was <i>this guy.</i>

13:31.760 --> 13:33.130
Oh!
Oh!

13:33.190 --> 13:34.400
Game's over, Grampa.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.400
I got down on the floor
for this?!

13:37.530 --> 13:38.470
Wait, Dad.

13:38.530 --> 13:40.570
I've got something for you.

13:42.030 --> 13:42.990
I was hoping

13:43.070 --> 13:44.640
it would be money.

13:44.700 --> 13:50.700
Oh dear. We're
in serious trouble here.

13:50.780 --> 13:53.650
We're just going to have
to cut down on luxuries.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.050
Well, you know
we're always buying
Maggie vaccinations

13:56.110 --> 13:57.680
for diseases
she doesn't even have.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.550
Actually, I was thinking
we could cut down on beer.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.560
We're not going
to be doing that.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.490
Then I'm afraid
there's no choice
but to give up the pony.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.490
First you didn't
want me to get the pony.

14:06.560 --> 14:08.600
Now you want me
to take it back.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.830
Make up your mind.

14:09.890 --> 14:10.920
Homer!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.100
Marge, Lisa loves me.
The pony stays.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.860
Alright. You got us
into this.

14:14.930 --> 14:16.390
You get us out.

14:16.470 --> 14:18.510
Fine, I will.
There's plenty of money
out there

14:18.570 --> 14:20.710
for a guy who's
willing to work for it.

14:20.770 --> 14:23.340
Do you have any jewelry
you don't need anymore?

14:23.410 --> 14:24.950
Mmmmm.

14:25.010 --> 14:28.280
You're <i>so beautiful.</i>

14:28.350 --> 14:31.450
Oh look, you haven't
touched your salt lick.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.120
Num-num.
Good salt lick.

14:37.590 --> 14:40.690
Homer:
Need money. Need money.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.300
One scratch-for-cash, please.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.300
Here you go.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.730
Liberty bell.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.930
Two liberty bells.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.940
Come on,
come on, come on...

14:49.000 --> 14:50.140
Oh.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.410
Yes!

14:51.470 --> 14:52.510
Whoo-whoo!

14:52.570 --> 14:54.380
Three liberty bells!

14:54.440 --> 14:56.710
That will be
$10,000, Apu.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.570
Congratulations,
Mr. Homer.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
Thank you.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.450
If I could just see
the ticket...

15:01.510 --> 15:02.540
There it is.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.910
Please to be removing
your thumb.

15:04.980 --> 15:05.980
No.

15:06.050 --> 15:07.790
Yes, please.
I must insist.

15:07.850 --> 15:08.810
No. No.

15:08.890 --> 15:09.790
You can't see...

15:09.850 --> 15:10.780
Yes, I must...

15:10.860 --> 15:11.790
No! Let go!

15:11.860 --> 15:14.160
You're ripping it.

15:14.230 --> 15:15.130
( <i>gasps )</i>

15:15.190 --> 15:16.420
A cherry.

15:16.490 --> 15:18.160
Oh, Mr. Homer

15:18.230 --> 15:21.440
what has reduced you
to such cheap chicanery?

15:21.500 --> 15:22.940
Oh... I need money.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.410
Well, if you need money

15:24.470 --> 15:27.470
you should have at least
jammed a gun in my ribs

15:27.540 --> 15:30.380
or better yet,
you could inquire
about my help wanted sign.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.480
You're looking for help?

15:31.540 --> 15:32.940
Yes, we need someone
for the demanding

15:33.010 --> 15:35.350
yet high profile
midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.710
I'm your man.

15:36.780 --> 15:38.390
- You're hired.
- Whoo-hoo!

15:38.450 --> 15:39.850
Always I dreamed the day
would come

15:39.920 --> 15:41.890
when one of you would
be working for me.

15:41.950 --> 15:46.520
( clapping )
So pretty.

15:46.590 --> 15:48.530
She certainly tamed
that horse.

15:48.590 --> 15:50.520
Yes, but what man
can tame her?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.100
<i>I won't lie to you.</i>

15:52.160 --> 15:54.220
<i>On this job,
you will be shot at.</i>

15:54.300 --> 15:56.840
Each of these bullet wounds
is a badge of honor.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.310
"Badge of honor..."

15:58.370 --> 15:59.870
Here's a pointer.

15:59.940 --> 16:01.880
Try to take it
in the shoulder.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.880
These hot dogs have been here
for three years.

16:04.940 --> 16:06.670
They are strictly ornamental.

16:06.740 --> 16:10.540
There is only one bozo
who comes in and buys them.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.390
But I eat... oh.

16:12.450 --> 16:15.720
( <i>Homer yawning )</i>

16:15.790 --> 16:18.560
The perfect crime.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.450
Homer, where have you been
all night?

16:21.530 --> 16:22.900
I was so worried.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.900
Marge, can we go
in the other room?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.890
I did something last night
I'm not proud of

16:26.970 --> 16:28.500
and I don't want the
kids to hear it.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.400
Busted.

16:30.470 --> 16:31.940
I'll work
midnight to 8:00.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.400
Come home,
sleep five minutes

16:33.470 --> 16:35.880
eat breakfast,
sleep six more minutes, shower.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.310
I have ten minutes
to bask in Lisa's love

16:38.380 --> 16:40.310
then off to the power plant.

16:40.380 --> 16:43.350
Oh, my God,
she killed him.

16:43.410 --> 16:47.850

16:50.020 --> 16:53.360
Mmm. Salty.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.250
Homer!

16:55.330 --> 16:57.630
Are you stealing Squishies?

16:57.700 --> 17:00.130
No, Sir.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.270
This next song is also

17:01.330 --> 17:03.330
about a girl and her pony.

17:03.400 --> 17:07.640
It's called "Wildfire."

<i>Come on, Apu, honey,

17:15.310 --> 17:16.839
Apu:
<i>Ohh!</i>

17:16.910 --> 17:18.310
I'm sorry, baby.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.140
While I'm here
pleasuring you

17:20.220 --> 17:22.960
my store is going
down the tubes.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.630
( <i>snoring )</i>

17:26.690 --> 17:32.630
Three dollars
and 51... 52... 53 cents.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.470
Homer, you are asleep
at your post!

17:35.530 --> 17:36.860
Now go change
the expiration dates

17:36.930 --> 17:38.230
on the dairy products.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
Yes, Sir.

Sorry, baby.

Homie, how long do you
plan to do this?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.200
I don't know.

18:44.270 --> 18:45.610
How long
do horses live?

18:45.670 --> 18:46.940

D-ohhh.

Yello?

18:57.420 --> 18:59.250
I just called
to say I love you, Dad.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.490
Thanks.

19:00.550 --> 19:03.460
When is she going
to stop loving me?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.330
( <i>snoring )</i>

19:05.390 --> 19:07.460
I just heard Milli Vanilli
was arrested

19:07.530 --> 19:09.660
for impersonating a McNugget.

19:09.730 --> 19:13.030
Well, it's still fun
to be up late.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.570
Hey, Homer,
where you going?

19:14.630 --> 19:15.930
Going for...

19:16.000 --> 19:19.010
eight-hour walk.

19:22.740 --> 19:23.510

19:23.570 --> 19:25.200
Homer. Homer?

19:25.280 --> 19:27.610
Homer sleep now.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.020
What's wrong with Dad?

19:30.080 --> 19:32.120
He's just exhausted.

19:32.180 --> 19:35.380
Lisa, do you know how much
it costs to keep a pony?

19:35.450 --> 19:36.450
No.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.960
Well, it's a lot.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.320
In fact, your father had
to take a second job.

19:40.390 --> 19:41.330
The poor guy.

19:41.390 --> 19:42.720
Where's he working?

19:42.790 --> 19:43.820
The Kwik-E Mart.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.530
( <i>laughing )</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:47.900
Lisa, I hope
you realize

19:47.970 --> 19:50.340
that your father
can't keep this up.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.210
You're gonna make me
give up Princess?

19:52.270 --> 19:54.880
Lisa, we can't make you
give up that pony.

19:54.940 --> 19:56.140
I can make her.

19:56.210 --> 19:57.880
Just give me five minutes
alone with her.

19:57.940 --> 19:58.870
No, Bart.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.500
No one's going to make her.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.520
This is something
Lisa has to decide
for herself.

20:02.580 --> 20:06.020
All the years I've lobbied
to be treated like an adult

20:06.080 --> 20:07.740
have blown up in my face.

20:09.990 --> 20:10.790
Hey!
Pink hat!

20:10.860 --> 20:11.790
When I ordered

20:11.860 --> 20:12.990
that blueberry squishy

20:13.060 --> 20:13.990
I meant today.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.630
Coming right up, Sir.

20:15.690 --> 20:17.990
And fill it to the top
this time.

20:18.060 --> 20:19.260
Yes, Sir.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.030
( <i>sighs )</i>

20:21.100 --> 20:23.540
She likes a little carrot
after her oats

20:23.600 --> 20:25.040
and she really
likes it

20:25.100 --> 20:27.530
when you scratch her
behind the ear.

20:27.610 --> 20:30.980
And if you're playing the radio,
she likes contemporary
adult in the morning

20:31.040 --> 20:32.950
and easy listening at night.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.450
Please take good care
of my Princess.

20:35.510 --> 20:38.840
Although there is no change
in my patrician facade,

20:38.920 --> 20:40.790
I can assure you
my heart is breaking.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.060
I'll never forget you.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.380
What the..?

20:46.460 --> 20:49.960
You call this melted cheese
receptacle clean?

20:50.030 --> 20:53.800
The young man you replaced
is rolling over in his grave.

20:53.870 --> 20:55.070
Dad, you don't have
to do this.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.060
Yes, I do.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.590
You see, Lisa

20:57.670 --> 20:59.940
grown-ups have
a thing called money...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.900
Dad, I understand the sacrifice
you've made for me.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.140
That's why
I gave up the pony.

21:05.210 --> 21:06.080
You did?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.640
There's
a big dumb animal

21:07.710 --> 21:09.820
I love even more
than that horse.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.220
Oh no, what is it,
a hippopotamus?

21:12.280 --> 21:14.280
I mean you, you dummy.

21:14.350 --> 21:15.920
Oh.

21:15.990 --> 21:21.560
Apu, you can take this job
and restaff it.

21:21.630 --> 21:22.660
( <i>laughing )</i>

21:22.730 --> 21:24.970
Giddy-up, Dad!

21:25.030 --> 21:26.100
( <i>whinnies )</i>

21:27.770 --> 21:29.800
He slept, he stole

21:29.870 --> 21:31.810
he was rude
to the customers.

21:31.870 --> 21:35.180
Still, there goes
the best damned employee

21:35.240 --> 21:37.080
a convenience store ever had.
