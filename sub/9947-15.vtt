00:08.600 --> 00:13.319
So, you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.320 --> 00:17.919
literally, literally, taking
the grass from its own roots.

00:17.920 --> 00:23.439
Now you've got your Con-Dem nation,
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.319
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:27.320 --> 00:33.679
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.680 --> 00:37.159
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.160 --> 00:43.199
Well, for fuck's sake, we live
in Manchester and they charge us
for water.

00:43.200 --> 00:48.079
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.719
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.720 --> 00:54.319
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.320 --> 01:00.039
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.120
Party!

01:06.080 --> 01:10.239
'You know where you're up to
with animals.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.999
'Which ones will sting you,
bite you, piss you off.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.639
'People are different. You've got no
fucking idea what people are about

01:17.640 --> 01:21.559
'until they've stung,
bit or pissed you off.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.039
'People don't advertise what they're
about. They say one thing

01:25.040 --> 01:27.959
'and do something completely
different.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.879
'You never know what's going on
for someone, what they're thinking.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.239
'What's what.'

01:34.240 --> 01:35.839
Don't miss your bus now.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.839
About time you made a move, innit?

01:37.840 --> 01:42.399
I don't work any more, I was sacked
for selling prescription pads
and flogging them on

01:42.400 --> 01:46.199
to the great unwashed and depressed.
I'm on a late shift.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.040
Meet me in the Jockey. Seven?

01:47.041 --> 01:48.279
Great.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.360
See you later.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.200 --> 02:10.679
Hiya! We meet again.
People will be talking.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.120
I've just delivered your mail.

02:12.121 --> 02:13.679
Is there anything else?

02:13.680 --> 02:14.800
It's just, I'm waiting
for something special.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.279
Again?

02:16.280 --> 02:18.879
More of the wrong names
at your address. Again.

02:18.880 --> 02:19.880
I'll sort them.

02:19.881 --> 02:21.719
I'll sort it out.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.720
No, I'll sort them.

02:22.721 --> 02:25.719
You must be snowed under,
what with the fire and that.

02:25.720 --> 02:29.799
We're up and running again.
We've got a dead mail room, opens
wrong addresses and lost letters,

02:29.800 --> 02:33.519
and gets in touch with the senders
and tells them who lives where.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.160
I'll do it.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.040
Four of those.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.920
Eight of those.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.320
Seven of those.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.760
Five of them. Seven.
Two. Four. Six. Eight. Two. Nine.

03:14.480 --> 03:15.759
Gracias.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.559
Can't wait.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.799
Fucking hate Magaluf.
Full of Spaniards.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.759
No, it's mainly British.
You should come. Half the estate are.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.159
Another reason not to.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.199
Come on, the more the merrier.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.400
The more the cheaper, you mean?

03:29.401 --> 03:31.479
Group discounts are no bad thing.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.480
Especially for the organiser?

03:32.481 --> 03:34.159
What do you mean?

03:34.160 --> 03:37.239
You'll be going free, won't you,
for planning it all?

03:37.240 --> 03:39.759
I'm only the treasurer.
It's all Karen's idea.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.200
Talking of... Can you get your hands
on any more of those uppers?

03:44.840 --> 03:48.319
You're not supposed to munch 'em
like fucking sweets, you know.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.919
It's been a difficult month or two.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.319
Right, I'm back. Where were we?

03:54.320 --> 03:57.239
I'm all over the place
at the minute, forgetting stuff!

03:57.240 --> 03:58.959
You were on question four.

03:58.960 --> 04:04.159
Question four. Have you ever
pleasured yourself - had a wank...

04:04.160 --> 04:05.719
in a public place?

04:05.720 --> 04:06.839
Yes.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.560
Yeah.

04:07.561 --> 04:09.159
Where?

04:09.160 --> 04:10.959
On a train.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.719
Work.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.359
It's high, this bar, innit?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.319
Now, that's four points each,
except Mimi.

04:17.320 --> 04:22.679
Question five.
Have you ever performed anal sex?

04:22.680 --> 04:24.279
Yep.

04:24.280 --> 04:24.920
Yeah.

04:24.921 --> 04:26.279
Have I fuck!

04:26.280 --> 04:29.359
You're quite straight on the quiet,
aren't you? No offence.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.999
It's funny, cos you've had
loads of blokes, haven't you?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.399
You calling me a slag?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.839
No.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.759
Just because I haven't got a bloke,
and haven't done

04:38.760 --> 04:42.920
half of what you lot have done,
doesn't make me a virgin, does it?

04:45.720 --> 04:47.399
What time do you call this?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.079
Sorry, I got held up.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.558
Time you had a new watch?

04:50.559 --> 04:51.880
Yeah, this one's playing up.

04:51.881 --> 04:53.959
Tah-dah!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.639
Must have cost a fortune!

04:56.640 --> 04:57.999
Unless it's a knock-off?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.519
It's proper. Work gave me a bit of
a bonus. Employee of the month.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.599
Again?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.160
I know.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.759
Will you get a room?

05:09.760 --> 05:14.680
We will. I've got questions
17 to 20 planned already.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.480
Ooh!

05:37.280 --> 05:39.560
Oh!

05:48.360 --> 05:50.559
I haven't got any knickers on.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.439
Ahem!

05:54.440 --> 05:56.279
You rang, brother?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.719
The delivery's there.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.119
So, where am I off to today, then?
Havana? Rio?

06:00.120 --> 06:01.199
Whalley Range.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.559
The address is in the bag,
with the bill.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.519
You OK to work through the night?
That new driver's gone AWOL.

06:07.520 --> 06:10.399
Always glad of the cash, brother.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.040
Hang on, another customer.
Chesney's.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.919
And Bex's.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.399
What can we get for you?
Where's it going to, mate?

06:20.400 --> 06:23.479
About 40 minutes? Cheers.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.319
Business is booming?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.999
Can't complain.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.760
Home deliveries, good idea. I've got
a bit of stock needs shifting.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.479
No way. He's not dealing.

06:36.480 --> 06:41.319
I don't want anything to do
with any dealers, right?

06:41.320 --> 06:43.439
Sorry, mate, I'm trying
to play it halal.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.719
He's trying to run
a respectable business.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.439
Yeah, don't want to get involved
in any illegal shit.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.559
Still come to me
for a bag of weed, though.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.679
Not any more.
Knocked it on the head.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.599
He has, right?

06:54.600 --> 06:58.520
Nappies. I forgot nappies.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.080
Oh, I'll get them, shall I?

07:05.760 --> 07:07.199
20 per cent.

07:07.200 --> 07:07.960
30.

07:07.961 --> 07:08.839
10.

07:08.840 --> 07:09.879
All right, 20.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.519
And if the cops appear?

07:11.520 --> 07:14.279
Deny all knowledge.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.520
Let your driver take the flak.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.479
Oh! Sorry.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.039
I'm not after a job or anything.
I'm busy enough.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.959
But when I'm here and that,
maybe I could, you know, help?

07:54.960 --> 07:58.119
You all right there, kid?
You gonna pay for that?

07:58.120 --> 08:01.840
Zero tolerance to shoplifters.
That includes you too, Frank.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.719
Fucking hell.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.160
Don't do something
you'll regret, eh?

08:08.161 --> 08:09.840
Dunno what you're on about.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.959
You little thief.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.559
Right, your mum or the police?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.919
Let go! Oi!

08:16.920 --> 08:17.678
Home?

08:17.679 --> 08:18.720
Give it back!
Dad.

08:18.721 --> 08:21.359
Please. I won't do it again.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.879
Bet you won't.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.239
Please, don't. Do you want some sex?

08:25.240 --> 08:27.599
You can have some sex.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.479
How old are you?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.919
Hello?

08:37.240 --> 08:40.519
I don't know what goes on in
her head half the time. Daft kid.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.878
I hope this don't mess anything up?

08:41.879 --> 08:42.919
Nah, don't worry.

08:42.921 --> 08:45.079
Thanks. I'll get her home,

08:45.080 --> 08:47.479
have a word, make sure
she doesn't do it again.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.360
Be back before you know it.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.200
Hm.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.519
You're fucking mental, Catshit!

09:02.520 --> 09:04.719
What did you want
with all that weed, anyway?

09:04.720 --> 09:07.520
Just leave us alone, yeah?

09:10.920 --> 09:11.878
He ate all the gear.

09:11.879 --> 09:13.160
It's not funny, Ches.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.999
It is. You giving it,
"It's the police, it's the police!"

09:16.000 --> 09:17.280
Yeah, all them flashing lights.

09:17.281 --> 09:18.839
A breakdown recovery truck?

09:18.840 --> 09:22.119
You've got to be careful
in my job. One fuck-up and that's it,

09:22.120 --> 09:23.358
you're on the nursery nurse
blacklist.

09:23.359 --> 09:24.480
Does that exist?

09:24.481 --> 09:28.559
Do you think Maxine Carr would ever
get a job as a nursery nurse? See?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.759
Now come on, let's go to bed.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.920
I'm in the toddler room tomorrow
with a dozen little fuckers.
I need all my wotsits about me.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.200
You all right, kid?

09:58.840 --> 10:00.799
It's for you-hoo!

10:00.800 --> 10:02.839
It's not my birthday.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.878
Doesn't have to be your birthday
to get a present, does it?

10:04.879 --> 10:06.520
I know we've always said no to this,

10:06.521 --> 10:10.159
but I think you're old enough now.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.039
I love her, Mum.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.599
Thank you, Mum.
Thank you, thank you.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.840
I'm gonna call her Beyonce!

10:23.160 --> 10:26.119
I haven't taken my vitamins yet.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.198
We've talked about getting a pet
a million times.

10:28.199 --> 10:29.078
You talked.

10:29.079 --> 10:30.120
Pets are expensive.

10:30.121 --> 10:31.439
It was only 500 quid.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.239
I didn't mean... 500 quid?!

10:33.240 --> 10:36.239
It's an investment. Can put her
out to stud and make a fortune.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.360
You don't put bitches out to stud.

10:39.640 --> 10:42.599
Well, it's lovely for a child to
grow up with a pet.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.399
You never had one, did you?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.479
You should have talked
it over with me.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.558
You'd have said no.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.960
So, you go behind my back instead?

10:48.961 --> 10:50.760
Fuck you.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.079
Do you know your problem?
You're a control freak.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.919
We'll continue this later.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.320
No, no, no. If you want to continue
this, we'll continue this now,

11:02.321 --> 11:04.079
you arrogant piece of shit!

11:04.080 --> 11:05.079
Morning!

11:05.080 --> 11:07.319
Hiya. Don't you run away from me!

11:07.320 --> 11:08.558
I'm not running.
I'm gonna be late for work.

11:08.559 --> 11:09.318
Bollocks!

11:09.319 --> 11:09.720
Stop it!

11:09.721 --> 11:10.799
Stop what?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.680
You're embarrassing me,
following me down the street.

11:12.681 --> 11:14.159
Embarrassing?

11:14.160 --> 11:16.799
Who the fuck do you think you are?

11:16.800 --> 11:20.119
Avril! I need to close my holiday
account now, me and Micky's.

11:20.120 --> 11:20.960
We need the cash quick.

11:20.961 --> 11:22.639
I haven't got it, Carl.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.960
I mean, I haven't got it right
at this moment. It's in the bank.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.280
Oi!

11:30.880 --> 11:33.559
Did you get it?

11:35.080 --> 11:37.679
Ha-ha-ha. Fuck off.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.880
The suffragettes...

11:38.881 --> 11:40.519
You're off your head, woman.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.359
The suffragettes
chained themselves to railings.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.759
Demanding their right
to buy a puppy?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.279
Fuck off!

11:47.280 --> 11:50.399
We're a team, Avril, me and you,

11:50.400 --> 11:54.999
and we work best when we make
decisions, not alone, but together.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.239
I knows my place, master.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.479
I goes home now and waits
on your next instructions.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.240
Yes, sir.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.680
Urgh!

12:55.280 --> 12:56.879
What year is it?

12:56.880 --> 12:58.480
1973.

13:08.240 --> 13:12.120
There's no fucking way
I'm going through all that shit.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.760
Urgh!

13:28.560 --> 13:30.560
Thank you.

13:43.200 --> 13:43.760
Morning.

13:43.761 --> 13:45.199
Hiya.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.479
Looks like you're going my way.
Do you mind if I walk with you?

13:48.480 --> 13:52.199
I mean, say no... I mean, yeah,
if you do.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.240
I don't mind. Hiya, Ches!

13:57.640 --> 13:59.679
What if she's
already gone to school?

13:59.680 --> 14:02.279
I can't stay here all day, you know.
I've got a business to run.

14:02.280 --> 14:06.119
I know, but think of that poor kid.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.319
I'd do it,
but I've got to go to work.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.919
You make sure she's all right and,

14:10.920 --> 14:13.479
er... I'll make it up to you later.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.240
My hero.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.079
We should do that again.

14:31.080 --> 14:34.879
Definitely. Although maybe something
a little easier on the knees?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.600
Low-impact exercise?

14:38.640 --> 14:41.720
Yeah, any suggestions?

14:43.040 --> 14:46.599
Swimming? It strengthens
all the muscles.

14:46.600 --> 14:51.039
I was thinking about something
I can work up a bit of sweat to.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.759
You know, I love it
when I'm like I am now.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.719
All hot.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.359
All wet.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.119
Badminton?

15:03.400 --> 15:06.039
Have you pulled something?

15:06.040 --> 15:07.639
I'm trying.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.519
I trained as a sports masseur.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.000
I could give you a rubdown,
if you like.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.079
Aaah!

15:16.080 --> 15:20.719
Yeah, now, there's just a little
nub of tension just there.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.359
Yeah.

15:22.360 --> 15:23.200
That better?

15:23.201 --> 15:24.879
Yeah.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.840
That good?

15:25.841 --> 15:29.079
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

15:29.080 --> 15:32.360
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Mimi, but... no.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.200
Hey!

15:43.160 --> 15:45.160
Wait.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.039
Look, I, er...
I just wanted to say sorry.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.039
I didn't know that your dad
would...

15:53.040 --> 15:54.759
It wasn't him.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.799
Don't sack him. Please.
It had nowt to do with him.

15:58.800 --> 16:03.720
I had a fight with this girl.
I fell down some stairs. Honest.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.200
Well, do you want a lift to school?

16:10.600 --> 16:13.279
That your car? How fast is it?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.040
Fast.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.639
What about your mum? You got a mum?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.479
Up in Scotland, Dundee.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.999
Nice.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.160
Never been there, then?!

16:31.640 --> 16:35.799
Look, it'd help if you talk to her,
talk to someone.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.200
No matter what you've done,
you don't deserve this.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.159
You think you know what's what
and that, but you don't.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.239
You don't know the half of it.

16:46.240 --> 16:49.040
Leave me alone. Please.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.719
Whoa!

16:54.720 --> 16:56.319
What did you do that for?

16:56.320 --> 16:57.600
I'm late. See you.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.760
Oh.

17:06.920 --> 17:10.359
Oh, fuck.

17:16.720 --> 17:19.200
Aah!

17:36.840 --> 17:39.920
Look who it is.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.599
All right, brother?

17:44.600 --> 17:47.519
I am. How about you?

17:47.520 --> 17:48.879
Can't complain, captain.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.798
And if I did, no-one would
listen, would they?

17:50.799 --> 17:51.760
What you drinking?

17:51.761 --> 17:54.079
Fuck off, child abuser.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.319
Battering your kid like that.

17:57.320 --> 18:00.599
If you think my kid's face
has something to do with me,

18:00.600 --> 18:02.519
then you're wrong, very wrong.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.718
She fell off her bike, that's all.

18:03.719 --> 18:04.920
That's not what she said.

18:04.921 --> 18:07.519
Come on, ring the police, Ches.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.719
And tell 'em about your paedo
tendencies while you're at it?

18:10.720 --> 18:12.679
School phoned me,

18:12.680 --> 18:13.838
concerned that my daughter's

18:13.839 --> 18:15.360
having an inappropriate
relationship.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.399
You were seen kissing her.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.519
No, no, no. She kissed me.
A peck and I pulled away.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.239
It's bollocks, I swear.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.480
Police would be dead into it.
They love nicking dirty old pervs

18:24.481 --> 18:27.479
from Gary Glitter's gang,
don't they?

18:27.480 --> 18:29.959
And don't you get any
big ideas either.

18:29.960 --> 18:33.319
Be an accessory,
part of his little paedo ring.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.919
Nursery nurse, aren't you?

18:35.920 --> 18:37.440
No.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.720
Maybe.

18:51.160 --> 18:52.759
Connie!

18:52.760 --> 18:53.640
Whose hen do is it?

18:53.641 --> 18:56.799
Oh, I was trying something
different.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.680
Any post?

18:57.681 --> 18:59.719
Been and gone.
And you won't be getting any

18:59.720 --> 19:01.918
of those mixed-up letters
and addresses any more.

19:01.919 --> 19:03.360
They're being killed off as we
speak.

19:03.361 --> 19:06.239
Everyone will know
exactly who lives where...

19:06.240 --> 19:08.719
and that will be the
end of that.

19:08.720 --> 19:13.199
And I won't be breaking my back
carrying a load of shit post.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.039
'You won't be getting any of those

19:15.040 --> 19:17.359
'mixed-up letters and addresses
any more.'

19:17.360 --> 19:18.200
Have you been to the bank yet?

19:18.201 --> 19:19.639
Our holiday money.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.479
Yeah, we want it back.
People are asking.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.479
Yeah, where are you going?

19:25.480 --> 19:26.559
April!

19:34.280 --> 19:36.560
I wanted to apologise about earlier.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.239
No, it's me that should be sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.679
I shouldn't have...

19:44.680 --> 19:46.719
No, I was giving out signals and
I...

19:46.720 --> 19:49.280
I just couldn't, Mimi.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.439
I'm sorry.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.280
My wife...

19:55.960 --> 19:58.159
My wife died recently.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.199
I'm not completely ready yet,
you know?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.120
Yeah.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.839
But I am a little attracted to you.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.639
And, you know, maybe one day,
I'll be ready for a relationship.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.319
Maybe I'm not ready
for a relationship either.

20:19.320 --> 20:23.720
Maybe I just want a good hard fuck.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.839
Beyonce! Beyonce!

20:29.840 --> 20:31.799
Sorry, not at this number.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.519
OK, bye.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.679
Change your uniform
before your dad comes home.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.840
Beyonce! Beyonce!

20:43.680 --> 20:44.879
Hiya, love.

20:44.880 --> 20:45.759
Hiya.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.199
Beyonce!

20:47.200 --> 20:49.679
Jackson!

20:49.680 --> 20:52.199
Finished early.
Thought we had stuff to sort out.

20:52.200 --> 20:55.280
Beyonce! Beyonce!

20:56.280 --> 20:58.039
Beyonce!
All right?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.159
Yeah!

20:59.160 --> 21:00.280
What's up?

21:01.960 --> 21:03.639
You seen her anywhere, Mum?

21:03.640 --> 21:05.120
The front door was open for a bit.

21:05.121 --> 21:06.759
It's escaped?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.839
Looks like it, yeah. But you've
not had a proper look upstairs,

21:09.840 --> 21:11.320
under the beds and that, have you?

21:13.280 --> 21:15.600
That's not your uniform.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.159
Letitia?

21:20.160 --> 21:23.559
You're right. She had an accident.

21:23.560 --> 21:28.559
She got run over by a car.
No, splashed by a car.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.679
Got soaked.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.040
So, you borrowed
someone else's uniform?

21:32.041 --> 21:33.920
Yeah.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.000
Someone from a different school?

21:39.120 --> 21:43.119
Avril Powell? I'm from ManLex,
your electricity supplier.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.119
Beyonce!

21:45.120 --> 21:46.839
You have an outstanding payment.

21:46.840 --> 21:50.559
You said it were good with kids,
and it's not. I want my money back.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.360
Avril! Avril!

21:58.280 --> 21:59.719
What's going on?

21:59.720 --> 22:01.879
We want our money right now.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.879
Yeah, our holiday money!
All of us!

22:03.880 --> 22:05.959
What have you done with it?

22:05.960 --> 22:08.560
Where's the money?

22:24.240 --> 22:25.480
You sold her dog?

22:25.481 --> 22:28.279
You were right.
We should have talked it through.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.520
Stole the holiday club money?

22:29.521 --> 22:30.759
Borrowed!

22:30.760 --> 22:33.519
And private school? Going behind my
back with fucking private school!

22:33.520 --> 22:34.640
You know what I think...

22:34.641 --> 22:38.239
Where you going? Where do you
think you're going? Doing a runner?

22:38.240 --> 22:40.839
I'm not. Just a minute.

22:40.840 --> 22:41.920
We need to talk.

22:41.921 --> 22:43.280
Get off!

22:52.440 --> 22:54.640
Surprise.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.439
They make money round
so it... it goes round.

23:20.440 --> 23:24.119
See, it can't wait to
fucking roll away from me.

23:24.120 --> 23:29.399
Yeah, you know, I've had a bit
of windfall roll my way.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.599
But, you know, at the end of the day...

23:31.600 --> 23:35.759
Fucking hate that.
What, £23.59 at the end of the day?

23:35.760 --> 23:39.399
Look at it, eh? Just all rolls on.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.120
The good Lord giveth with one hand,
and taketh away with the other.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.760
He's your employee,
he's your problem.

23:46.761 --> 23:49.319
This delivery arrangement suits me.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.600
I'm expanding into new areas,
the lad seems good at his job.

23:51.601 --> 23:54.679
Don't rock the boat and fuck it up
with your bleeding heart.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.840
It's good business.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.119
Avril?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.680
We have to talk about this.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.599
We owe thousands.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.360
Where's it all gone?

24:16.600 --> 24:19.079
Your wages is pennies,
and mine is stopped.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.240
- Stopped?
- I've been sacked!

24:26.480 --> 24:30.159
Gross misconduct
for stealing prescription pads.

24:30.160 --> 24:34.199
No pay, no reference,
no chance of getting another job.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.159
I can't even sign on!

24:36.160 --> 24:37.319
Why?

24:37.320 --> 24:40.199
- There were bills and... and
rent and...
- And shopping?

24:40.200 --> 24:43.639
Instead of dealing with the bills,
you splash out on a bit of
retail therapy?

24:43.640 --> 24:47.599
Only to sell on.
Or presents for you, for Letitia.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.280
To make you happy.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.479
- Open the door, sweetheart.
- I'll sort this out.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.080
- How?
- Move?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.400
We'll move.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.160
We've done it before - moved on when
the going's got tough.

25:06.161 --> 25:09.759
We've never run away.
We've only ever moved up.
Bigger houses...

25:09.760 --> 25:13.360
Jackson, do you really think
we moved here out of choice?

25:14.840 --> 25:17.879
We can be in a new place tomorrow.
Start again.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.239
Fresh, clean page. Everybody happy.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.280
We're not running away!

25:22.800 --> 25:26.439
We're not!
We'll pay it back!

25:26.440 --> 25:28.240
All of it!

25:30.080 --> 25:31.119
Somehow.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.880
Well, we are going nowhere.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.840
I said no peeking.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.960
Mm. First one.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.039
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.600
Mm, nice.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.199
Mm. Mm.

26:01.200 --> 26:02.880
Hm.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.399
Uh-uh-uh-uh. Mm.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.960
- Ah. Ah.
- Mm.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.759
Mm! Mm!

26:14.760 --> 26:16.519
Ah, yeah.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.799
- Ah.
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

26:18.800 --> 26:20.480
- Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Oh!

26:23.640 --> 26:26.439
This floor's a bit sticky,
isn't it?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.839
Morning.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.080
Just gonna rustle up
some breakfast for your mum.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.119
- Enjoy.
- Yeah, see you later... Dad.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.040
Aah!

26:54.360 --> 26:57.639
I thought it was you.
She's been in there all night.

26:57.640 --> 27:02.239
That stands for everything I hate,
money buying privilege.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.399
Must be nice for you, though,

27:04.400 --> 27:08.279
not having to sneak around any more,
changing uniforms behind my back.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.120
It's easy to sneak around someone
that has their head in the sand.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.639
I know the price of stuff
and where the money comes from.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.399
You happy with
your plasma screen TV, yeah?

27:18.400 --> 27:21.479
Rare vinyl, blu-ray, holidays...

27:21.480 --> 27:25.280
Coffee. Smell it. Wake up.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.559
Mum?

27:31.560 --> 27:32.600
Mum!

27:36.320 --> 27:38.680
Mum!

27:47.800 --> 27:49.360
We can't go bankrupt.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.839
- Why not?
- Be like everyone else around here.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.959
It's OK. Doesn't bother me.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.519
Bothers your dad.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.239
You could call Grandpa.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.920
I'd rather go bankrupt.

28:05.840 --> 28:06.880
Then we'll sort it out.

28:06.881 --> 28:09.120
All of us, as a family.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.680
Just a couple of shifts
here or there, that's all.

28:18.200 --> 28:19.760
Please, Chesney.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.679
No offence or 'owt,
but your name's mud round here.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.160
If I give you a job,
people will boycott the shop.

28:29.160 --> 28:31.640
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.599
You did the right thing.

28:36.600 --> 28:40.399
- Did I?
- Mm. Using your business head.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.959
I'm proud of you.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.759
Get shut of you-know-who
and his lies...

28:44.760 --> 28:48.279
and then we can concentrate on us
and the business. Mwah!

28:48.280 --> 28:50.880
Oh, I'll get it.

28:53.640 --> 28:57.119
All right? Surprised you called me.

28:57.120 --> 28:58.679
I need a driver.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.640
It's business.

29:03.680 --> 29:05.039
That's all.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.560
Just business?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.320
He's on his way.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.479
You're looking good.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.919
Between you and me...

29:26.920 --> 29:29.200
Fucking nerve!

29:35.320 --> 29:37.200
Got any shifts going?

29:39.400 --> 29:40.919
Go on.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.718
I've been trying to shift some weight...

29:42.719 --> 29:44.880
Although I haven't lost
a single fucking pound...

29:44.881 --> 29:48.679
Well, that could be something
to do with you falling in love.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.039
It's not over, is it?

29:50.040 --> 29:51.240
Between you and the running man?

29:51.241 --> 29:53.439
Nah, but it's not love either.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.199
We're just having a bit of fun.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.199
I've got some catching up to do,
haven't I?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.000
We've been acting out our fantasies.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.479
- Is that you?
- Aye.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.799
Did you come on your horse?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.519
I did that.

30:08.520 --> 30:15.320
Even though I arrived on horseback,
I certainly haven't come yet.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.919
- ..Me darling.
- Me darling.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.520
Ha-ha-ha!

30:21.560 --> 30:26.239
He didn't enjoy
that one so much, so now
we concentrate on his fantasies.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.559
Oh, yeah?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.960
Well, go on, I won't tell anyone.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.479
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.719
- Ah. Oh.
- Mm.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.839
It's nothing compared to
what you were bragging
about the other night.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.559
It is. And we were probably
lying about half of it anyway.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.920
He's degrading you, Mimi.

30:48.921 --> 30:50.279
Nah.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.040
He is.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.239
- Ahem.
- Sorry. Thanks.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.600
Dirty bastards.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.479
Hm. We should get someone
to look after the shop
for an hour or two.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.360
- Yeah? OK.
- Yeah.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.519
Tah-dah! Yeah.

31:13.520 --> 31:14.678
I'm a free man.

31:14.679 --> 31:16.120
Not banged up
on a possession charge.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.039
Like butter wouldn't melt.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.880
Police just pulled me.

31:23.640 --> 31:27.919
Luckily I hid this lot
somewhere else.
I thought it was a strange order.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.238
Ten grams for one house
that's not Kerry Katona's.

31:30.239 --> 31:32.040
I wouldn't get away
with personal use.

31:32.041 --> 31:33.879
Caught with that amount.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.919
That's intent to supply. Life.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.839
You've been dealing.
No.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.439
Course he has.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.320
Do you think he cares about
anything else other than himself,

31:41.321 --> 31:42.840
other than his business?

31:44.040 --> 31:45.439
Ah.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.319
Think it's time we went
our separate ways, sweet cheeks.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.439
We're leaving town.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.280
But I'll keep hold
of this, though.

31:52.281 --> 31:54.479
Call it a severance package.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.640
You explain it to Jamie Maguire.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.040
- I'll get my bag.
- No!

32:11.720 --> 32:13.760
Mm-hm!

32:19.360 --> 32:21.920
What do you want?

32:25.680 --> 32:27.839
I tried the shop.
The Jockey.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.079
Everywhere.
You're my last chance.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.279
We're pushed for punters
as it is.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.520
Please.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.079
She steals from her own.
We'll be boycotted.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.400
Her name's mud around here.

32:38.401 --> 32:40.039
Kelly's right, love.

32:40.040 --> 32:41.399
Everyone does hate ya.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.480
I know.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.879
Change of underwear here,
along with your condoms.

32:50.880 --> 32:55.279
Use the flavoured ones for oral,
the mint for the ones
who refuse to wash.

32:55.280 --> 32:59.559
Toys are in here. Make sure
you clean 'em after you've used 'em.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.840
There's some spray in there,

33:00.841 --> 33:03.239
but you might want to get
the nailbrush on 'em

33:03.240 --> 33:07.159
if there's a bit of
stubborn something.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.279
Enjoy.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.880
Come in.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.279
I went for an Indian. He hadn't
done owt. I just went for him.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.519
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Joking.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.679
But I've got us a nice little
something.

33:42.680 --> 33:46.279
I've picked up a curry
and naan breads and the works.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.879
It's not very healthy, though,
is it?

33:48.880 --> 33:51.599
Hey, well soon burn that off
with what I've got planned for us.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.159
No, no.

33:54.160 --> 33:58.879
Were going to have
a really nice healthy meal,

33:58.880 --> 34:01.119
then were going to go to bed

34:01.120 --> 34:08.280
and have normal, very normal,
straight vanilla, nice sex.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.559
You're not cut out for this game.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.960
Sorry, love.

34:26.120 --> 34:30.799
Id like to think that I've
helped you become a little freer.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.839
Its helped you and all,
get over the loss of your wife.

34:34.840 --> 34:40.560
Ill never get over Tracy.
She was my life, my everything.

34:44.880 --> 34:47.799
Last Christmas,
after her third heart attack.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.239
She was a big girl.

34:49.239 --> 34:53.719
That's nothing compared to Michelle,
my first wife.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.280
You like the big girls, then?

34:56.281 --> 35:00.279
I like to help women
realise their true potential.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.759
Like you, Mimi.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.239
Samosa?

35:04.240 --> 35:09.839
I could see you wanted to lose weight
but you were going the wrong way.

35:09.840 --> 35:14.319
You need to bulk up,
do less, eat more.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.839
Get up to that sexy size 34.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.959
Get the fuck out!

35:18.960 --> 35:20.799
I'm a feminist, Mimi.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.759
I help women put on weight

35:22.760 --> 35:27.999
rather than wanting them,
like the rest of society, to lose it.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.119
Lose weight or put it on,

35:31.120 --> 35:37.359
I do it for me, not you,
you weird-sex little turd!

35:37.360 --> 35:39.439
Oh, come on, Mimi.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.679
You could be so beautiful
if you'd just...

35:42.680 --> 35:45.280
eat it, bitch.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.559
Oh, yeah.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.079
Oh, yeah. Oh!

35:54.080 --> 35:56.479
Oh!

35:56.480 --> 35:59.679
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, yeah!

35:59.680 --> 36:02.839
Aah! Aah! Oh! Oh!

36:02.840 --> 36:06.999
I don't ever want to see you
round here again!

36:07.000 --> 36:09.039
Got it?

36:09.040 --> 36:11.679
Urgh! Aah!

36:11.680 --> 36:15.039
You know I grew up with nothing.
Warming tins of beans up
on radiators.

36:15.040 --> 36:19.319
That's why I was trying to
make a better life for you, us.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.959
I was trying to make you happy.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.039
And you have.

36:22.040 --> 36:27.479
But I don't need things to make me
happy. I just need you.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.960
So, its just the rest of the estate
that hates me?

36:29.961 --> 36:31.960
They wont once
we've paid them back.

36:31.961 --> 36:34.719
How? Bit by bit.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.919
I've seen the head and I'm going to
do a bit of extracurricular work.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.920
All right, lads?

36:49.040 --> 36:51.119
Nothing demeaning.

36:51.120 --> 36:54.999
Well pay the club money back first,
then start on everything else.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.199
And, yeah, well struggle, but only
as much as anyone else around here.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.519
We wont starve.

37:00.520 --> 37:06.480
And everything else, what does it
matter, as long as were all right?

37:08.280 --> 37:10.279
Come on, lets get you home.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.200
By the way,
how much do you charge for oral?

37:19.840 --> 37:23.520
Oi! Get in, were moving.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.920
What you doing?

38:26.080 --> 38:29.999
Jamie Maguire's fucking potty,
you know. Hell track you down
and he will kill you.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.799
Over a couple of bags of coke?

38:32.800 --> 38:34.839
Is that why you're here,
to save us from Jamie?

38:34.840 --> 38:39.279
He's here for the coke. It's all
you care about, innit? Business.

38:39.280 --> 38:42.840
Not interested in her, are you?
I'm the only one who cares.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.960
Take it.
It's what you're here for, innit?

38:54.840 --> 38:57.640
Now get out and don't come back.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.119
Something else?

39:04.120 --> 39:06.799
Its not business, its pleasure.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.880
I thought as much.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.719
I've seen the way
you look at her. You're here
for her, really, aren't you?

39:17.720 --> 39:21.479
You'd love to get your hands on her,
wouldn't you? Dirty little fucker.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.919
How much?

39:22.920 --> 39:25.879
How much do you want for her?

39:25.880 --> 39:27.600
A hundred? Two?

39:29.480 --> 39:34.120
To fuck her. How much do you want
from me so I can fuck her?

39:35.840 --> 39:38.759
Come on,
its not the first time. Eh?

39:38.760 --> 39:40.959
Or is it?

39:40.960 --> 39:44.120
Ill give you more if it is.
How much?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.159
A grand.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.079
You'll bring her round to my flat.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.399
No, not your place.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.919
Or here.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.439
Somewhere safe, neutral.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.360
You can trust me.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.519
Ill find a shitty hotel.

40:05.520 --> 40:10.199
Call me when you've got the money.
Ill tell you where to meet.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.679
A grand.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.360
Cash only.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.920
Business.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.279
Hm. Do you like that, Catshit, yeah?

40:31.960 --> 40:33.959
Ooh. Mm.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.999
Oh. Oh. Oh.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.439
Oh! You frightened me to death,
you fucker.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.639
All right?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.720
I thought we were...

40:42.721 --> 40:45.000
Oh, give us a minute, babes.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.879
I'm sorry, Ches, dead sorry.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.919
I like you and that,
but I cant go out with a dealer.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.320
It's not in my job description,
I'm afraid.

40:53.321 --> 40:54.879
No, no, I've sorted it.

40:54.880 --> 40:59.159
I've given the coke back to Jamie,
and I wont be dealing again,
I swear it.

40:59.160 --> 41:02.600
I'm going to save the kid, the girl.
Come with me.

41:03.600 --> 41:04.438
Come on.

41:04.439 --> 41:05.560
Just leave it alone, yeah?

41:05.561 --> 41:07.199
No, I've set something up and...

41:07.200 --> 41:08.640
They've moved off the estate now.

41:08.641 --> 41:12.759
Just leave it alone, yeah?
Its not your problem anyway.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.040
You should have just let her be.
Shell be right anyway.

41:15.041 --> 41:16.759
I did this for you. Me?

41:16.760 --> 41:19.959
You know, I thought... thought
you'd be chuffed, proud of me.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.479
I thought you were special.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.799
I am special.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.080
No, you're not.

41:27.160 --> 41:30.479
Well, Ill come and see you
when I'm done here.

41:30.480 --> 41:31.879
Don't bother.

41:32.521 --> 41:34.320
I'm not doing it for you anymore.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.759
I'm on my way. Where are you?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.000
Hello? Fuck.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.519
It's all right.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.600
I'm not going to hurt you.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.000
There was this car...

42:20.001 --> 42:22.080
Oh, sweetheart!

42:23.720 --> 42:25.839
Its OK, honey.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.880
Its OK.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.920
I know it is.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.999
Beyonce! Where are you?

42:38.000 --> 42:39.799
Beyonce! Beyonce!

42:47.000 --> 42:51.200
Look, I'm so sorry. Here you are.
Get yourself another dog.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.800
I have another idea.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.679
Are you all right?

42:59.680 --> 43:01.439
Business, love?

43:01.440 --> 43:03.080
You dirty kerb-crawling scum!

43:09.040 --> 43:11.959
Completely legit.

43:11.960 --> 43:15.560
Cashed in some old jewellery,
flogged a couple of things.

43:17.600 --> 43:20.719
They say you shouldn't judge
books by covers, and you shouldn't.

43:20.720 --> 43:25.199
But people with nothing
don't have to be nothing, you know.

43:25.200 --> 43:30.000
And, by the same token,
people with something
aren't necessarily something.

43:32.760 --> 43:35.040
Go to your mum. Start again.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.960
Thanks.

43:43.640 --> 43:48.119
Lots of folk love the Queen
and the Royal Family.
They think they're nice.

43:48.120 --> 43:51.119
Its a start.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.040
They've got all of those
houses, palaces and estates,

43:53.041 --> 43:55.159
shit-loads of cash and jewels,

43:55.160 --> 44:00.439
and yet they still hold out
gloved hands for more.

44:00.440 --> 44:05.959
And yet you can go travelling
and meet some of
the poorest people on earth

44:05.960 --> 44:10.519
and they'll tear their last piece of
bread in half to share with you.

44:10.520 --> 44:13.119
Don't presume that someone's nice
just because they look nice,

44:13.120 --> 44:16.999
and don't presume
someone's a knobhead
just cos they look like a knobhead.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.559
Don't care about the way people look,
but care about what they do.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.159
Its actions, not appearances.

44:25.160 --> 44:32.680
And if you're not nice, one way
or another, somehow, you will burn.

44:55.280 --> 44:56.520
The pub is mine.

44:56.521 --> 45:02.480
And until you swear you'll return it,
you ain't getting your bollocks back.

45:06.120 --> 45:06.520
Don't move.

45:06.521 --> 45:09.639
I had a few drinks
and took some drugs.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.599
You're a very bad man, Frank.

45:11.600 --> 45:13.040
'You have to be stopped.'

45:13.041 --> 45:15.279
I caught some bastard
shagging our daughter.

45:15.280 --> 45:16.919
He's not some dirty bastard...

45:16.920 --> 45:19.279
they've been seeing each
other for weeks.

45:19.280 --> 45:21.559
Letitia's new boyfriend is
probably my son.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.559
'Come clean
and my marriage is over.'

45:23.560 --> 45:25.160
Morning, Daddy.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.959
100 quid? You're good, but...

46:07.960 --> 46:10.719
That's it. I'm calling my pimp.

46:10.720 --> 46:12.120
There's role play and there's...

46:12.121 --> 46:15.519
Any more shit from you, motherfucker,

46:15.520 --> 46:17.320
and I'll pop a cap
in your goddamn ass.

46:17.321 --> 46:19.360
Thanks, pimp.

46:19.385 --> 46:22.985
