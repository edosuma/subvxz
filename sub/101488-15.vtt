WEBVTT

00:21.646 --> 00:23.356
-And that's when
I switched to boxer briefs.
-Mm-hmm.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.567
And I never looked back.
Best of both worlds.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.318
Okay, I'm heading out.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.903
Hey, Linda, you're just in time to hear

00:28.987 --> 00:30.113
why I changed my underpants.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.198
I-I mean the kind of underpants I wear.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.908
I'm gonna have to take
a rain check, Teddy.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.201
I'm going on a power walk.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.287
Ooh, power walk. Sounds fun.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.164
What is that? Do you stomp really hard?

00:39.247 --> 00:41.541
Yeah, it's a part of this thing
I'm doing with Ginger.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.585
Gettin' Fitty in your Forties.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.628
It's all about exercising
and eating better

00:45.712 --> 00:47.505
-and being in your forties.
-Can I do it, too?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.799
-I could probably be healthier.
-No.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.385
Sure you can. Get ready for salads

00:52.469 --> 00:54.471
and veggies and smoothies.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.806
Smoothies with cayenne pepper
and flax seed.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.433
Wow. What's flax seed?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.101
I don't know, but I feel great.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.853
Maybe it comes from a flax machine.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.689
-Ha! I'm getting fittier and funnier.
-Yeah, you are.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.566
Anyway, Ginger already took her walk,

01:06.649 --> 01:08.610
so now I got to take mine
or I'll get a frowny face

01:08.693 --> 01:09.736
on my profile.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.071
And Ginger and I have this bet.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.655
Whoever gets the most frowny faces

01:12.739 --> 01:13.865
has to wear their bra over their shirt

01:13.948 --> 01:14.866
for a whole day.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.993
That might be bad for business.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.411
Or possibly good.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.830
Yeah, it depends on the bra.
Ooh, I better get going.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.916
We got the kids' parent-teacher-
student conferences

01:22.999 --> 01:23.917
in an hour and a half.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.127
Yeah, where they make us all sit together

01:26.211 --> 01:27.837
and discuss the kids
right in front of them.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
I try to not make eye contact
with... our children.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.384
Well, they don't usually
grade the parents,

01:32.467 --> 01:34.594
but I bet the teachers will
probably give me an "A"

01:34.678 --> 01:37.847
for A-mazing lifestyle changes
and great parenting.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.433
-Speaking of, where are the kids?
They're late.
-You're right.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.019
Maybe it's for a good reason?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.479
I mean, it never is.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.773
Maybe there's a cool new dance
all the kids are doing,

01:46.856 --> 01:48.775
and they're having a dance-off
in the alley?

01:48.858 --> 01:49.984
Why is it in an alley?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.861
That's where people step to you, Bob.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.697
Maybe they got on
the wrong bus from school

01:53.780 --> 01:55.198
and ended up in a different town.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.866
-That happened to me a lot.
-(entry bell jingles)

01:56.950 --> 01:58.451
LINDA:
There you are. Where were you?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.954
Where were<i> you?</i>
No? Does that not work?

02:01.037 --> 02:02.872
-(sighs) We all got detention.
-What?!

02:02.956 --> 02:04.708
-Yeah.
-Uh-huh.
-How?

02:04.791 --> 02:06.876
I swapped out Ms. Labonz's
morning announcements

02:06.960 --> 02:08.420
with the lyrics for "Baby Got Back,"

02:08.503 --> 02:10.088
which she only read the first line of,

02:10.171 --> 02:11.673
but it was hilarious.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.299
I put a hot dog in the pencil sharpener

02:13.383 --> 02:15.343
to make Hot Dog Swirl Snacks--
patent pending.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.721
And Tammy said horses are just
boring zebras.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.389
And one of us got her hair pulled,

02:19.472 --> 02:20.890
and the other one got detention.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.308
So, what's new around here?

02:22.392 --> 02:23.893
I can't believe you guys.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.645
What?
Oh, the detentions.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.063
Yeah, kids, that's not good.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.399
But, Gene, the hot dog thing?
I kind of get it.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.984
I've had the same thought before.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.986
-(angry groan)
-But y-you shouldn't do it.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.071
And you do this on parent-
teacher-student conference day,

02:35.155 --> 02:36.656
of all days?!

02:36.740 --> 02:38.533
I guess it's not a great look.
Sorry, Mom.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.785
But, hey, if it helps,
you don't even have to worry

02:40.869 --> 02:44.164
about punishing us
because detention was... woof.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.833
It was rough.
They didn't let us get water,

02:46.916 --> 02:48.668
more than several times.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.587
And there were no pastries at all.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.963
Not even a bear claw.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.715
I did kind of enjoy
being alone with my thoughts.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.092
-(Louise clears throat)
-But, yeah, it was hard. Real, real hard.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.094
Oh, you're all getting punished,
Miss Missies

02:58.178 --> 02:59.262
and Mister Misters.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.348
But we're sorry, Mama.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.059
-No! It's not gonna work this time, Gene.
-(gasps)

03:04.142 --> 03:07.228
It's called rules, okay?
Rules exist for a reason.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.273
It's how society is a thing.
You got to follow the rules.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.692
Right? Bob, right?
This is where you come in.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.152
Um, yeah, that's right.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.737
Sorry, you just seemed
like you were on a roll.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.989
I mean, we should all be trying
to be better people

03:18.073 --> 03:19.240
around here, you know.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.326
I'm doing my part.
I'm eating flax.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.079
-Maybe you should just relax
and have some more flax.
-No!

03:24.162 --> 03:26.039
No, Gene.
Leave my flax out of this.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.208
Now I'm going on my power walk,
and I'm gonna think of

03:28.291 --> 03:30.543
a punishment that fits how annoyed I am.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.796
Spoiler alert, it's gonna be a big one.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.965
In the meantime, get to work
here and do your homework.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.592
-(entry bell jingles)
-Wait, which one do you want us to do?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.636
Both.
Multitask!

03:39.719 --> 03:42.097
Wow, I would not want
to be you guys right now.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.807
-Nope.
-Thank you both.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.308
Mom seemed extra angry.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.976
Her teeth were grittier than ever.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.353
Gritty and gorgeous.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.146
Okay, so here's what I think we should do.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.107
Work extra hard, and when she comes back,

03:52.190 --> 03:53.858
this place will look so great, she'll say,

03:53.942 --> 03:55.443
"No punishment necessary."

03:55.527 --> 03:57.862
Yeah. And she'll pick us up
and throw us in the air

03:57.946 --> 04:00.782
and say, "My beautiful bouncing babies."

04:00.865 --> 04:02.325
I mean, I always work extra hard.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.827
I leave it on the field every day.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.371
But, okay, let's try it
with all three of us.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.873
So, Bob, back to my underpants story.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.251
Oh, do we need to go back?
I think I got it all.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.461
Here's the thing.
I signed up for an improv class,

04:13.545 --> 04:14.838
and I'm really nervous about it.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.423
So we're not talking about underpants?

04:16.506 --> 04:17.799
No, we are.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.342
Our first performance is tonight.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.011
I'm starting to freak out,
so I was wondering

04:21.094 --> 04:23.388
if you'd come to the show
and yell out a suggestion.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.848
In this case, underpants,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.766
so I can roll into my underpants story.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.476
I don't think the point
of improv is to have

04:28.560 --> 04:30.186
a story ready to tell, Teddy.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.355
Oh, I'm sorry, Professor Think-em-ups.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.982
Listen, please just come.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.275
Please come and yell out "underpants."

04:35.358 --> 04:37.569
-No.
-Yes, and?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.821
(scoffs)
I can't believe those kids.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.281
Darn rule-breaking hooligans.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.491
On parent-teacher-student
conference night.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.201
Out of my way, squirrel!

04:45.285 --> 04:46.953
-Oh, I'm so mad.
-(stomach rumbles)

04:47.037 --> 04:49.956
Uh-oh, cayenne smoothie
is moving around in there. Ow.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.043
-Oh, oh, oh, boy. I better go back home.
-(rumbling louder)

04:53.126 --> 04:54.836
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I'm gonna poop!

04:54.919 --> 04:56.171
Oh, no. Oh, no, it's gonna happen.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.547
Oh, thank God.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.257
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.800
Hold it, hold it.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.886
-Damn it! Oh, what?
-(rumbling)

05:02.969 --> 05:04.137
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

05:04.220 --> 05:06.014
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.808
-Tag, you're it.
-Eh, stupid kids!

05:08.892 --> 05:10.268
I mean, hi.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.354
Childhood.
Happy memories.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.064
Oh, maybe I'll just go behind there.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.525
No. No. No. No. No!
Hi.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.111
Oh, my God, it's happening!

05:20.195 --> 05:22.614
-(relieved): Okay...
-(siren wails)

05:22.697 --> 05:24.908
Oh, poop.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.871
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>You got to believe me.</i>

05:29.954 --> 05:31.498
I almost always poop in toilets.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.667
It was an accident.
An emergency.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.836
-That's what they all say.
-They all say that? Who's they?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.588
-Public poopers.
-What?!

05:38.672 --> 05:40.965
No, no, that's not who I am.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.509
This was all just a mistake.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.261
I'm on this new exercise program,
and I'm eating healthy.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.846
I think my body's just confused

05:46.930 --> 05:48.640
that I'm not shoveling garbage into it.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.100
It's not used to salads.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.894
And that damn cayenne pepper
is a spicy little bastard.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.230
So, I didn't need to hear any of that.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.566
-Uh, the fine is $100.
-Okay.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.569
But since you have no wallet or ID,
or even a phone,

06:01.653 --> 06:03.780
we need someone to come pay the citation

06:03.863 --> 06:05.156
with cash before you can leave.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.366
Okay, no problem.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.867
I'll call my husband
and he'll be right here.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.620
I get a phone call, right?
Like in the movies?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.038
-Let me see your hands.
-Wha?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.832
-Palms up.
-Oh, hand sanitizer.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.459
Right, right, right, right.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.836
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>Oh, come on, Bob.</i>

06:17.919 --> 06:20.380
Kids, tell your dad
to come to my improv show

06:20.463 --> 06:21.631
and yell out "underpants."

06:21.715 --> 06:23.174
I'll do it at your wedding.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.427
Sorry, Teddy, we're quietly
and obediently doing our work,

06:25.510 --> 06:28.680
-like good children.
-But if you want some advice,
maybe just have fun with it?

06:28.763 --> 06:30.598
You think improv's supposed to be fun?!

06:30.682 --> 06:31.850
-(phone ringing)
-Sorry, sorry.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.436
Bob's Burgers.
Oh, hi. What?

06:34.519 --> 06:36.730
You're kidding.
Are you serious?

06:36.813 --> 06:40.066
Uh, okay, okay, let me look.
We might be a little short.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.277
But I'll go to the bank
and head right over.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.280
Oh, uh... I-I promise.
I won't.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.907
L-Love you, too.
Bye.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.117
That was, um...
(clears throat)

06:49.200 --> 06:50.744
...the restaurant supply store.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.038
They called me personally
to say they're-they're having

06:53.121 --> 06:56.332
a, uh, half-off sale
for the next 30 minutes.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.667
And you love them?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.961
-Yes, very much.
-TINA: Aw.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.463
Uh, so I'm gonna go check it out real fast

07:01.546 --> 07:03.590
and be back in time
to take you to your conferences.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.009
Kids, go upstairs
and-and do your homework. Teddy,

07:06.092 --> 07:08.553
-um... leave.
-Okay, fine.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.055
But if you need someone
to shout "underpants"

07:10.138 --> 07:12.098
in a room full of ten or 11 people,

07:12.182 --> 07:13.933
don't come crawling to me, Bob.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.185
Okay, sounds good.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.436
Are you sure you don't want us
to stay here

07:16.519 --> 07:18.438
and do <i>extra</i> work, Dad,

07:18.521 --> 07:19.564
with our sweet little hands?

07:19.647 --> 07:21.232
Yeah, really get into it.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.776
I don't know, maybe mop the ceiling?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.194
No, that's-that's okay.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.780
We could tackle that sticky corner
that we always avoid.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.699
So many hairs stuck there.
It looks like a little forest.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
I'm positive.
Go upstairs and I'll be right back

07:31.993 --> 07:34.037
with, uh, all those restaurant supplies
I'm gonna get.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
-Your wish is our command, Papa.
-(bell jingles)

07:36.206 --> 07:38.958
Looks like there's no cleaning
our way out of this one.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.169
And Mom's still out there,
angrily strutting around

07:41.252 --> 07:43.088
thinking of God knows what to punish us.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.298
And God's seen some pretty rough stuff.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.426
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>So, uh, yeah,</i>

07:48.510 --> 07:50.637
-my husband will be here really soon.
-Mm-hmm.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.139
And, uh, he'll bring the money
and we'll clear all this up.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.058
-Uh-huh.
-He just has to stop at the bank.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.268
Sure.
He sounds great and totally real.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.436
He is real.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.647
You know what else is real?
Toilets.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.774
I know.
I was looking for one.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.109
Would it help if I showed you a picture

08:04.192 --> 08:06.778
of what they look like?
Toilet. Toilet.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.447
That's the kind I have.
Oh, that's a nice one.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.824
-That one's okay.
-Ugh.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.158
That one's dumb.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.161
What? Bank holiday?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.580
I know, right?
Another one?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.500
They should just tell us the days
that aren't bank holidays.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.918
It'd be a shorter list.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.795
Well, at least the ATMs are open.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.463
I know, but it's not the same.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.508
-I like the human interaction.
-Why is my card not working?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.969
Oh, it's all scratched up.
How did that happen?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.804
Oh, right.

08:32.887 --> 08:35.598
Get in there.
Oh, ah...

08:35.682 --> 08:37.350
-Is that my ATM card?
-Yeah.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.644
I'm showing Gene and Tina
how they can open any door

08:39.728 --> 08:41.396
with a simple credit card.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.605
I'm not sure I need to know this.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.065
Then why did you sign up for

08:44.149 --> 08:45.859
Louise's Life Skills Workshop?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.486
I thought it would be more
about organizing my closet.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.613
I'm just here to network.
Hello, I'm Gene.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.740
What do you do for work?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.409
Oh, my God, I hate that workshop.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.412
Math, math, math.
Oh, who can do math

08:57.495 --> 08:59.122
-at a time like this?!
-I know.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.707
I think we finally
pushed Mom over the edge.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.208
I'm scared of what she's gonna do to us.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.209
It's gonna be bad.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.919
It's gonna be really bad.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.671
You think she's gonna ground us
through high school?

09:06.755 --> 09:09.382
What if she replaces our hands
and feet with mops and brooms,

09:09.466 --> 09:10.925
makes us clean all day long?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.802
What if she hires a gorilla to eat us?!

09:12.886 --> 09:14.346
I know they're plant-eating,
gentle giants,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.139
but everyone has their price!

09:16.222 --> 09:17.599
What if she says no TV?

09:17.682 --> 09:19.809
-Aah!
-Aah! I don't want that life!

09:19.893 --> 09:21.644
Hey, did you guys watch
that really great TV show

09:21.728 --> 09:24.481
-that was on the TV last night?
-ALL: No!

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
Too bad.
It was a shared cultural moment.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.859
(chuckles)
See you later.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.403
We can't let this happen!

09:30.487 --> 09:32.155
-MAN: Just the gum?
-BOB: Yes.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.366
So, you were sitting at home,
and you thought,

09:34.449 --> 09:36.368
"I need some gum, I'm gonna get in the car

09:36.451 --> 09:38.370
and head over to the grocery store"?

09:38.453 --> 09:39.662
Uh... yeah.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.289
So can you just ring it up?

09:41.373 --> 09:43.124
Yep. Ringing up one gum.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.418
One gum for the man that only needs gum.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.836
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.005
I-I came to cash a check
because the banks are closed

09:49.089 --> 09:50.548
and my ATM card isn't working.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.926
-Cash a check?
-Yeah. Like, if I write a check

09:53.009 --> 09:55.387
for $40 over the amount of my purchase,

09:55.470 --> 09:57.055
you give me the $40.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.057
Oh, no, I, uh, I know
what cashing a check means,

09:59.140 --> 10:00.934
but we're not in the '80s anymore.

10:01.017 --> 10:04.437
-What?
-Most stores stopped doing that
a long time ago, including ours.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.648
Well, there should be a sign
that says that.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.899
There is.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.901
-Damn it!
-You still want the gum?

10:09.984 --> 10:11.903
-Yes.
-That'll be $1.39.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.531
Uh, one dollar

10:14.614 --> 10:17.450
and 39 cents.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.494
This feels like time traveling.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.038
Carp. 40 minutes till parent-
teacher-student conferences.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.374
Oh, why can't we just have
lots of money lying around?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.459
Oh. Linda's secret emergency money drawer.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.337
-Of course! I forgot.
-You know, the more I hear you,

10:29.421 --> 10:31.423
the more I feel like
your life doesn't make sense.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.466
But, uh, I'm just a normal person.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.093
Shush.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.803
I don't know what's taking him so long.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.054
He should have been here by now.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.848
Yeah, most people who exist

10:39.931 --> 10:41.099
would have been here by now.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.308
You know what?
I have an idea.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.977
I'll go home, I'll get the money,

10:44.060 --> 10:45.186
I'll come right back and pay you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.313
No, no, that's not how this works.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.732
No, yeah, it's good, it's good.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.859
So should I just let everyone out of jail?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.444
I'm sure they'll all come back, right?

10:52.527 --> 10:54.112
I mean, it's something to try.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.239
I'm gonna go, I'll be right back.
You'll see.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.782
You really should sit back down.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.618
If you walk out that door,
I'll be forced to detain you.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.871
More than I'm already detaining you.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.914
-But we're friends.
-Nope.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.834
Acquaintances?
If I saw you on the street, I'd say hi.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.252
Ma'am, don't open that door.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.628
No, it's fine, it's fine.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.757
Oh, double poop.

11:17.218 --> 11:20.055
In case Mom really does go crazy
and says no TV,

11:20.138 --> 11:22.807
we should make a cardboard decoy TV
for the living room,

11:22.891 --> 11:24.601
and we'll put the real TV in my room.

11:24.684 --> 11:25.935
-Um, my room?
-My room.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.896
Okay, we'll put the TV
in the middle of the floor

11:27.979 --> 11:29.522
and let it come to who it likes best.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.899
-(door closes)
-Aah! Homework!

11:30.982 --> 11:32.317
Yeah, my hands are so sore

11:32.400 --> 11:34.235
from doing all this homework so well.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.280
And my butt is sore
from all of my homework farts.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.075
-Uh, uh-huh, uh-huh, great.
-Are you chewing gum?

11:40.158 --> 11:42.077
Since when do you have gum
we don't know about?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.079
Did you get anything good
at the restaurant supply store?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.622
Maybe some fun aprons?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.791
-Oh, um...
-Apron fashion show?

11:47.874 --> 11:49.793
First of all, even if I did
get some good aprons,

11:49.876 --> 11:52.629
you kids are in trouble,
so no apron fashion show.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.547
-Boo.
-And second of all, um,

11:54.631 --> 11:57.759
there wasn't anything good at the store,
so I got some gum

11:57.842 --> 11:59.386
to cheer myself up.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.846
And now I'm going
into my bedroom to get something,

12:01.930 --> 12:04.307
and I don't want you to follow me.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.143
I like new Gum Dad.
He's in charge.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.728
<i>LINDA:</i>
<i>You made a big mistake</i>

12:08.812 --> 12:10.647
putting me in here, a big mistake.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.608
<i>Pretty Woman</i> big.
Not that I do <i>Pretty Woman</i> stuff.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.443
My lawyer's gonna be so mad!

12:15.527 --> 12:16.945
What's your lawyer's name?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.572
John Lawyer... ton.

12:19.656 --> 12:22.033
John Lawyerton.
I've heard of him.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.159
-He's good.
-Oh.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.828
Oh, there's Sergeant Bosco.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.579
He'll vouch for me.
You'll see.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.248
He knows I'm good for the money.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.583
-Sergeant Bosco!
-Linda Belcher?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.336
-What are you doing here?
-It's all a big misunderstanding.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.046
I was on a power walk and I got a ticket

12:35.130 --> 12:37.257
and I don't have my purse or any ID.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.050
Yeah?
What'd you get a ticket for?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.970
Nothing. It was nothing.
It-it was no big deal.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.055
Public defecation.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.182
-Oh, dear Lord.
-No, no, please.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.892
It was the cayenne pepper.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.436
And maybe the flax, I don't know.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.230
Oh, but come on, Bosco, you know me.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.442
I thought I knew you.
Public poopers are just... ugh.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.528
I mean, this is a society.
There are rules.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.947
I know, I know. I say that all the time.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.574
It's just the worst.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.950
Well, what about murderers?

13:04.034 --> 13:06.369
Well, murder is bad, too, but at least

13:06.453 --> 13:09.456
it's not pooping outside
like some kind of psycho.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.250
Sergeant Bosco, wait, come back.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.128
-It was an accident.
-That went well.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.340
Come on, secret emergency money
underwear drawer.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.675
Nothing. And so many holes
in the underwear.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.385
Why does she keep these?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.554
-(yelps)
-Are you looking for Mom's
secret cash stash?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.473
Hey.
I told you not to follow me.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.058
You look like a different guy from behind.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.517
Huh.
What's this?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.478
"I.O.U. seven dollars.
Love, Linda."

13:31.561 --> 13:32.979
Why would she write herself I.O.U.s?

13:33.063 --> 13:34.189
GENE:
Because she's on it.

13:34.272 --> 13:35.690
Dad, what's happening?

13:35.774 --> 13:37.067
Why do you need emergency money?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.902
And where's Mom?
She should be back by now.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.613
-What's going on?
-Was Mom taken and you
need to pay her ransom?

13:41.696 --> 13:44.449
Should we call Liam Neeson?
Do we need some Neeson?

13:44.532 --> 13:48.161
-I bet he drives a Nissan.
-(hyperventilating)

13:48.244 --> 13:50.580
Tina, kids, calm down.
Everything's okay.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.166
Bull-doody.
Give us some answers, old man.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.127
(sighs) Okay, fine.
While she was on her walk,

13:56.211 --> 13:59.714
your mom got a ticket,
and we have to go pay the ticket

13:59.798 --> 14:02.425
but I don't have enough cash
and the banks are all closed.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.135
-Mom got a ticket?
-Yes.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.929
It's just a ticket?
So she's fine? Phew.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.014
Tina, I know
this is a little awkward, but...

14:08.098 --> 14:10.016
you don't have
any babysitting money, do you?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.477
Like, $18?
I'll-I'll pay you back tomorrow.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.437
With interest.
50%, I get half.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.398
-Tina, let's do this.
-I don't have any.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.982
I spent it all on Boys 4 Now perfume.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.819
Pituitary by Boyz 4 Now.
It's nasty.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.197
(sighs) I think I have an idea
of how to get some money.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.157
Wait a minute,
what did Mom get a ticket for?

14:26.241 --> 14:27.784
I promised her I wouldn't tell you.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.619
-Jaywalking?
-Walking way too loud?

14:29.703 --> 14:32.872
-Did her boob fall out again?
-No. Wait, her boob fell out?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.250
At the store once.
She didn't notice for a while.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.376
She's fun.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.794
-Was she trespassing?
-No.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.254
-Carjacking?
-No.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.256
Flapjacking?
It shouldn't be illegal.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.216
No, look, the reason she got a ticket

14:43.299 --> 14:45.427
was not that big of a deal, but I promised

14:45.510 --> 14:47.679
-I wouldn't tell you.
-Why are we stopping here?

14:47.762 --> 14:49.472
Time to say goodbye to an old friend.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.641
Is that a panini maker?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.101
BOB:
It's my CD player.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.853
It's the only thing that truly gets me.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.356
So as you can see,
it-it's in great condition.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.942
-Mm...
-I paid probably a lot for it.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.986
And it-it has the cassette thingy here

15:03.069 --> 15:04.612
that you plug into the dashboard,

15:04.696 --> 15:07.741
which is basically magic,
and the CD goes there.

15:07.824 --> 15:11.286
Oh, it has skip protection,
by the way, so rest easy.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.621
I-I could let it go for $40.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.040
I'll give you five bucks for it.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.458
What?
A-Are you crazy?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.752
CDs are coming back.
I-In a big way.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.920
I'm young and hip
and I can vouch for that.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.256
So am I and so can I, daddio.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.674
Five bucks, take it or leave it.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.677
-$18? Final offer.
-Let me handle this, Dad.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.222
Hey. Give my dad $18
for his old man music machine.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.058
I'd listen to her if I were you, mister.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.351
She seems loco.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.394
-No.
-Well, I tried.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.396
Okay, that didn't go great.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.023
But at least I didn't have to lose you.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.941
-To that mean man.
-What are we gonna do now?

15:42.025 --> 15:43.943
Well, your parent-
teacher-student conferences

15:44.027 --> 15:45.820
start in half an hour.
(sighs)

15:45.904 --> 15:47.822
I guess there's one other thing we can do.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.616
-Tell us what Mom did?
-No.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.451
-(phone rings)
-Hello, Teddy?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.453
I deserve this.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.663
I was supposed to be
getting fitty in my 40s

15:55.747 --> 15:57.957
but instead I got poopy in the park.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.001
I'm a bad person rule breaker.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.753
No wonder the kids all got detention.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.672
Look at what kind of example I set.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.924
They'll never respect me again after this.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.926
They probably don't want to come
'cause they won't be able

16:08.009 --> 16:09.886
to look me in my public pooping eyes.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.180
That's why they're taking so long.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.224
-What are you in for?
-Attempted to sell drugs

16:14.307 --> 16:16.351
to a state trooper.
You?

16:16.434 --> 16:19.396
-Public defecation.
-Oh.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.858
So, you need $18?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.902
-Yep.
-Is it okay if I only have a 20?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.904
Yeah, that's fine, Teddy.
Thank you.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.739
Do you want to give me
the two dollars' change now,

16:29.823 --> 16:31.741
or just owe me the whole 20?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.576
I-I'll owe you 20, Teddy.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.370
I'm so sorry, we're-we're in a big rush.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.830
I can't believe Linda got a ticket

16:36.913 --> 16:38.373
and you won't tell me what it's for.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.709
Probably flapjacking.
(chuckles)

16:40.792 --> 16:43.503
He won't tell us, either.
He's keeping that mustache shut.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.296
Except to chew his precious gum.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.381
Oh, you got gum?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.466
Y-Yeah.
Do-do you want a piece?

16:48.550 --> 16:50.051
I never say no to a piece of gum.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.387
Okay, uh, here you go.
Now if I could just get that...

16:52.470 --> 16:54.723
-Maybe one for now, one for later?
-(sighs)

16:54.806 --> 16:57.100
-Okay, fine. Here.
-Big night for me, too, I guess.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.102
-Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.
-I'm just bouncing off the walls.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.938
-Going through scenarios,
you know, pre-improvising.
-Right.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.607
-Yep.
-Who knows. Who knows what
the night holds, right, Bobby?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.277
-Mm-hmm.
-Ah. Maybe I'll think of some improvs,

17:07.360 --> 17:09.988
maybe I won't, maybe my mind
will just go blank.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.531
Okay, fine.
Teddy, I'll come.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.158
I'll come and yell out "underpants."

17:13.241 --> 17:14.951
Oh, really?
That's great.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.661
Because you weren't that into it before.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.455
Yeah, no, yeah.
It's-it's gonna be great.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.749
So, anyway, Teddy, we really have to go.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.084
We have parent-teacher-student
conferences in 20 minutes.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.962
Gosh, I-I'm just dying to know
what Linda's ticket was for.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.673
I bet it was something great
and the cops just misunderstood.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.383
Like stealing a cloud.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.385
-It was for public pooping, okay?
-(all gasp)

17:32.469 --> 17:34.387
I mean, allegedly.
I mean, not that.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.848
I was improvising.
Forget I said anything.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.267
I'm taking the 20.
Bye.

17:39.351 --> 17:40.560
Wow.

17:40.643 --> 17:41.978
Mmm.
Just chew it, Teddy.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.647
Don't swallow it.
(gulps) Damn it!

17:48.735 --> 17:50.028
Okay, you guys have to pretend

17:50.111 --> 17:51.488
I didn't tell you what your mom did.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.740
May-may or may not have done, I mean.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.492
Y-You have to erase that from your minds.

17:55.575 --> 17:56.993
There are some things
your father tells you

17:57.077 --> 17:58.411
that you never forget.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.038
And "your mom got a ticket
for public defecation"

18:00.121 --> 18:01.956
is definitely one of them.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.667
I can't believe this
and I can't believe I learned

18:03.750 --> 18:05.085
a new word for poop today.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.711
Defecation, defecation, defecation,

18:06.795 --> 18:08.254
-(grumbles)
-defecation, defecation, de...

18:08.338 --> 18:10.298
Dead.
They're all dead.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.008
Bob, Tina,

18:12.092 --> 18:15.178
Gene, Louise-- dead.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.097
That's why they aren't gettin' me.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.015
I've got no one and nothing in this world.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.225
I live here now.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.560
Can I-can I switch cells?

18:22.644 --> 18:25.397
Hi, we're here to pay the fine
for Linda Belcher. Here it is.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.856
In small bills.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.233
Great.
Why is it wet?

18:28.316 --> 18:30.193
-Is that sweat?
-Probably.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.571
20, 25, 26...

18:33.655 --> 18:34.989
We're kind of in a hurry, so...

18:35.073 --> 18:36.991
Well, now I've lost my place.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.410
20, 25...

18:38.493 --> 18:40.036
It's just, we have the kids'

18:40.120 --> 18:41.454
parent-teacher-student conferences,

18:41.538 --> 18:43.873
and we need to get to the school, so...

18:43.957 --> 18:46.209
-Oh, let me know how that goes.
-TINA: We got detention today.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.461
That's probably already in your system.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.130
I don't know if that's how it works.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.715
Yeah, we had a meeting
about it with the chief.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.924
Oh, God.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.260
Hi, honey. Sorry it took
so long to get here.

18:55.343 --> 18:58.013
There were, um, some, uh, money things.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.931
It's fine.
Hi, kids.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.808
-Hi, Mom.
-Hey, there.
-Hello, Mother.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.144
-You told them, didn't you?
-Told us what?
-No.

19:04.227 --> 19:06.062
I don't even know what defecation is.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.689
Something you do at church?

19:07.772 --> 19:09.941
Yeah, sorry.
And I told Teddy.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.110
And maybe a guy at the ATM.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.446
-I-I can't really remember.
-Okay, fine.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.364
I pooped in public and I got arrested.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.742
Not technically.
You were detained.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.744
-She got detention.
-Thank you.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.580
So, newsflash:
your mom isn't perfect, okay?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.957
What made you think
we thought you were perfect?

19:26.041 --> 19:28.084
Yeah, you're a work in progress.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.170
Hey, we should really finish
this conversation i-in the car.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.005
Uh, the conferences
start in seven minutes.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.425
So we should leave jail and go do that.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.886
So you thought I was gonna say no TV?

19:37.969 --> 19:40.680
-Kind of?
-I would never. I'm not a monster.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.808
TV's almost my favorite child.
If I had a favorite.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.268
We do celebrate its birthday.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.936
And you thought we'd never respect you

19:47.020 --> 19:48.563
or listen to you again?

19:48.646 --> 19:50.982
Well, yeah.
Why would you, after all this?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.984
Are you serious?
You did time.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.778
I respect you more than ever now.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.113
Yeah, you've changed, man.
You got hard.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.157
And we also kind of
don't want to end up like you.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.784
-(laughs softly)
-So I...

20:00.867 --> 20:02.285
kind of scared you straight?

20:02.369 --> 20:04.037
-GENE: Damn straight.
-Well, then, good.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.747
-BOB: Okay, let's go in.
-LINDA: Wait a sec. Listen.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.791
-We're already late.
-So we'll be a little late.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.168
Here's the thing: it is important

20:10.251 --> 20:11.670
for everyone to follow the rules.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.755
But sometimes we make mistakes.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.049
Some we can control,
like putting a hot dog

20:16.132 --> 20:18.468
in a pencil sharpener, and some we can't.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.261
-Like clenching your <i>sphynxter.</i>
-"Sphincter."

20:20.345 --> 20:21.429
-What did I say?
-Never mind.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.014
But as long as we're trying,

20:23.098 --> 20:25.183
we'll all be okay, you know?

20:25.266 --> 20:27.310
-(coughs) You pooped in a bush.
-Look at me.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.397
Any of you bring this up
inside of that school, ever,

20:30.480 --> 20:31.940
the TV goes in the ocean.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.109
-(shouts)
-Got it.
-We won't, ever!

20:34.192 --> 20:36.695
-You, too, Bob.
-I'm so scared of you right now.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.280
Good.
Now somebody get me a baby wipe.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.323
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

20:40.407 --> 20:41.658
So we need a suggestion.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.659
Anything at all.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.577
-Underpants.
-Chicken wings.

20:44.661 --> 20:47.288
Oh, chicken wings.
I got a great story about chicken wings.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.791
I mean, i-it's a thing
I'm just coming up with now.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.876
-Okay, chicken wings.
-What?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.920
Ah, one order of chicken wings, please.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.797
-(chuckles)
-Oh, my God.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.842
Uh, take it easy, sir.
Who brought this guy? Uh...
