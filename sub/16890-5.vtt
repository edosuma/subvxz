Hey, Red.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.886
You're making me wish
I was those jeans.

00:09.969 --> 00:12.096
Well, I wish
I was your yellow hat!

00:12.179 --> 00:13.848

- What?

00:13.932 --> 00:16.267
It's my favorite color.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.894
Did I say something wrong?

00:17.977 --> 00:20.730
Okay, uh, I'm sorry
about the jeans thing.

00:20.813 --> 00:21.856
You made your point.

00:21.940 --> 00:23.065
And my point is wh--

00:23.148 --> 00:24.943
That I say these things
to women

00:25.025 --> 00:27.194
even though I got a mother
that I love

00:27.278 --> 00:29.906
and three beautiful sisters,
okay?

00:29.989 --> 00:31.950
- Are you happy?
- Happy but nervous.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.952
My friend from Indiana
is coming to visit.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.453
Why do I talk to women
like that?

A construction worker
called me Red.

we could have nicknames.

That I will not ask her
any questions

01:45.064 --> 01:46.357
about the bunker.

to kiss you later.

then we can wait.

and smell his chest. [sighs]

04:49.123 --> 04:50.791
Oh, my gosh.
Super great!

I'm managing the pet store
in town.

are moving into a new house.

Cool! Wait a minute!
Did you get a tattoo?

05:00.259 --> 05:02.511
Yeah,
I saw it on a Chinese menu,

05:02.594 --> 05:04.013
and I just fell in love
with it.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.764
It means "bean curd."

05:05.848 --> 05:07.975
Brandon got a matching one
for our one-month anniversary,

05:08.059 --> 05:09.935
but there was a mix-up,
so his is in English.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.729
[Kimmy]
Ah, wow. Matching tattoos.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.480
Yeah.
It's real popular now,

05:13.564 --> 05:16.316

of your food or being biracial.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.442

Gosh, Cyndee.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.569

you're doing pretty great too.

we kissed today.

- [gasps delightedly]
- This is boring!

05:28.871 --> 05:30.581

to the bathroom?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.130
Did anybody try
to eat anybody?

05:38.214 --> 05:39.631
Was there ever a moment
where you were like,

05:39.715 --> 05:41.092
"The real prison is
in my mind"?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.434
Well, I wanted to let you two
catch up,

05:50.517 --> 05:52.394
so I went and got you flowers

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
from the flower district.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.732
And from
the Meatpacking District...

05:56.815 --> 05:58.358
- Meat.
- Ah, thank you!

06:10.537 --> 06:12.414
You asked me to help you
keep an eye on Cyndee, correct?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.041
Yeah, but now
you don't need to.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.500
I underestimated her.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.419
She's got a job and a house

06:17.502 --> 06:19.671
and a guy who brings her
the traditional meat and flowers

06:19.755 --> 06:20.798
of Indiana courtship.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.300
Yeah, that boy's gay.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.717
- What?
- Gay as a penguin.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.427
- [gasps]
- Educate yourself.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.512
- Read a nature video.
- He's not gay.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.265
Gay hasn't even gotten
to Indiana yet.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.058
There have been rumors in Ohio.

06:31.142 --> 06:33.185
I know small-town gay, Kimmy.

06:33.269 --> 06:35.437
Brandon has a tan line where
he usually wears a leather cuff.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.648
He's from Indiana, but he weighs
less than 200 pounds.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.608
And there's a stain on his jeans
that could only be

06:39.691 --> 06:41.568
from re-varnishing
an Edwardian escritoire.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.028
- What?
- It's gay for "desk."

06:43.112 --> 06:45.405
Ugh!
You're being ridiculous, Titus.

06:48.617 --> 06:52.330
Titus! When are us guys
going to talk about cars?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.874
Huh, Titus.
Brandon is into cars.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.168
Kimberly, a word.

07:01.339 --> 07:02.673
That was smoke and mirrors,
Kimmy,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.508
two things gay men love.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.677
And I'd call him out on it
if I knew anything about cars.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.762
Did I say that right?
"Curs."

07:08.846 --> 07:10.514
- "Coors."
- Stop it.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.557
Why would a gay man even want
to be with Cyndee, Titus?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.643
I-- what would he possibly
get out of that?

07:14.726 --> 07:16.020
Very well!
I'm sure you're right.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.480
There's no way Brandon's gay.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.565
Which means you wouldn't care
if I tried to seduce him.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.484
- What?
- I'm just saying.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.278
Obviously, I'll fail.

07:24.362 --> 07:26.405
Because Cyndee's boyfriend
is super straight, right?

07:26.488 --> 07:28.657
Right.
Do whatever you want.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.660
The wheels are already
in motion.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.465
So, Brandon,

07:45.549 --> 07:46.800
tell me about yourself.

07:46.884 --> 07:47.926
What do you like to do?

07:48.010 --> 07:49.636
I'm just a regular guy.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.390
I like, uh,
NASCAR and fishing,

07:52.472 --> 07:53.974
you know,
quoting Borat,

07:54.058 --> 07:55.851
setting up universal remotes,

07:55.934 --> 07:57.686
and, of course, Vegas, baby.

07:57.769 --> 07:58.854
[Cyndee]
Come on.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.980
Let's go someplace else.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.400
Let's go to the fanciest place
in Manhattan.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.860
Did you know some places
call shrimp "prawns"?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.237
I do now.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.863
We could get a reservation
anywhere.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.199
Just call up and say
we're Mole Women.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.909
What? No.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.202
I don't tell anyone
about that.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.413
Really?
Kimmy, that's crazy.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.415
Because when people find out
you're a Mole Woman,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.417
they feel bad for you
and they give you free stuff!

08:19.499 --> 08:21.335
Is that what you do
in Durnsville?

08:21.419 --> 08:23.503
You get stuff because people
feel sorry for you?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.464
Sure.
I didn't finish middle school.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.466
I'm not qualified
to run a pet store.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.927
I just said I liked dogs,
so they--

08:30.010 --> 08:33.597
Oh, no, I forgot to get someone
to cover for me while I'm here.

08:33.680 --> 08:37.768
So... the clothes, the house,
the "curs," the car...

08:37.851 --> 08:39.270
that is not an easy word.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.896
[Brandon]
It really is pretty great.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.274
The Durnsville Elks Club
is paying for this whole trip,

08:43.357 --> 08:45.025
plus spending money.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.569
I want to get
a big-city spray tan.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.530
So you both get stuff
out of this.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.326
[pop music ringtone]

08:54.410 --> 08:55.286
[gasps]

08:55.369 --> 08:57.871
Ooh, it's the Durnsville
Board of Education.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.623
This year,
I get to pick the chapter

08:59.706 --> 09:01.875
that gets taken
out of the science textbook.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.092
I think I'm going to have
the chef salad.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.676
Who do you like
to have sex with?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.804
Oh, I like hairless guys
with a little bit of--

09:13.887 --> 09:15.680
You are an escritoire!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.141
I'm a desk?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.767
I mean,
I don't know what that means.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.938
[knocking on door]

09:23.021 --> 09:24.482
[Lillian]
What do you want, dear?

09:24.523 --> 09:26.400
I was Rear Window-ing,

09:26.484 --> 09:28.402
and it was just starting
to get good.

09:28.486 --> 09:31.822
The old man on the third floor's
stuck in the tub.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.532
He's starting to panic.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.534
Lillian,
I'm planning a seduction.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.119
A seduction.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.455
I remember those days.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.499
A cocktail at the bar,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.084
a conversation held only
with the eyes,

09:44.168 --> 09:47.004
and then the two of you
retire to the bathroom.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.547
I called you
because I need you to keep

09:48.630 --> 09:50.466
Kimmy and her girlfriend
out of the apartment.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.050
Oh, sure.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.635
I just need five minutes
with that country boy.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.804
Or however long
Kenny Loggins' Footloose is.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.598
Titus, cherish this time.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.101
Someday you'll wake up
and you'll say,

10:01.185 --> 10:03.312
"Who's that old woman
in the mirror?"

10:03.395 --> 10:06.064
And then she'll punch you,
and you'll say,

10:06.148 --> 10:09.151
"That's not a mirror.
That's an open window."

10:10.610 --> 10:12.363
What are we talking about again?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.489
Eh.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.450
You're lying to my friend.

10:16.534 --> 10:17.576
I'm telling her!

10:18.285 --> 10:19.328
Kimmy!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.873
Kimmy, please!

10:22.956 --> 10:25.709
I'm not using Cyndee
to get stuff for myself.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.337
- I'm part of the stuff.
- What?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.173
She wanted me.
Ever since middle school.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.758
What choice did I have
after what she's been through?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.177
I do whatever she wants.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.889
I-- I got a tattoo
that says "bean curd."

10:38.972 --> 10:40.640
So you're doing all this
to make her happy?

10:40.724 --> 10:43.227
I dumped Richard Hinkle
for her.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.729
He's the one I wanted
to give flowers and meat to.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.774
No, this is not okay, Brandon.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.860
- You're lying to her.
- Really?

10:51.943 --> 10:55.072
You never lied to Cyndee
in the bunker?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.865
We're never going to get out
of this stupid bunker.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.451
I'll never own a sports car
or a pool.

10:59.535 --> 11:01.579
And Brandon Yeagley
got Apocalypsed!

11:01.661 --> 11:04.206
Well, that's not true.
The reverend told me.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.874
God spared Brandon.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.959
And he's in an all-men's bunker,

11:08.043 --> 11:10.379
so you know he's being faithful.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.505
Really?

11:11.589 --> 11:15.175
[in Spanish] "Brandon" is
a gay guy's name, right?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.177
Okay.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.846
You know Cyndee needs someone
to take care of her.

11:19.930 --> 11:23.975
You left, so everyone back home
is stepping up.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.228
Please don't ruin it for her.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.521
Welcome to New York.

11:27.605 --> 11:29.523
I wanna say... Brandon?

11:30.732 --> 11:31.816
Ugh.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.070
Titus, it's Brandon.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.030
The gals are outside
talking to your landlord.

11:37.114 --> 11:40.409
So then, in 1984...

11:50.168 --> 11:52.879
I think you know.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.424
Well, I was wrong.
Brandon is not gay.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.509
[whispers] No, he is.
He told me.

11:57.593 --> 11:58.636
[whispers]
That's impossible!

11:58.718 --> 11:59.928
I tried to seduce him.

Am I not a pretty young thing

What do I do?

12:10.522 --> 12:11.898
Are you asking me for advice

12:11.982 --> 12:13.525
because I seem like
a wise old black man?

12:13.609 --> 12:15.944
Oh, God.

the senior citizen discount.

Why would they think someone
ordering broiled scrod

is a senior citizen?

about Ancient Greece

were different then?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.371
Awesome.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.959
I've only got one life,
so it's now or never.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.294
What do you mean next level?
Like, relationship-wise?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.837
Okay, cool, look,
why don't you draw their fire?

17:25.921 --> 17:27.338
I'll steal the antidote
from the monkey lab.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.382
Let's go for it.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.134
I found these butterscotches
in my pocket.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.427
They just appeared!

17:32.510 --> 17:34.596
It's a sign!

17:34.679 --> 17:36.347
Come on,
I'm totally exposed here.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.975
- Don't let me down, dude.
- Okay, I'm gonna blow the door.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.101
- Oh, the monkeys look mad!
- Okay, dude.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.478
- Okay.
- [both] I'm in!

17:41.561 --> 17:42.729
I got it.
Meet me by the hover-car.

17:42.813 --> 17:45.273
Awesome! Yes!

17:45.356 --> 17:47.108
[sighs]
I love you.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.527
- Me, too, dude.
- Me, too.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.988
Oh, my gosh.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.447
I thought it was rude
when you said,

17:52.530 --> 17:54.282
"Troll the respawn, Jeremy."

17:54.365 --> 17:57.285
But I figured that was just
a new way of saying goodbye.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.412
I've been saying it all day.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.666
Troll the respawn, Jeremy.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.669
[laughs]
First time on bath salts, dear?

18:06.169 --> 18:09.088
So you thought that I said
I love you

18:09.172 --> 18:11.758
after we kissed, like, twice?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.802
And you want to get
matching tattoos?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.637
Kimmy, you don't know anything
about me.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.972
You're from Tampa.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.431
You have two sisters,
Liz and Sarah.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.809
And your childhood dog
was named Jellybean.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.769
None of that is correct.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.395
Kimmy, I thought
that this was just fun--

18:24.479 --> 18:26.898
Me, too-- I was trying
to have fun,

18:26.982 --> 18:29.484
and then I made everything weird
'cause I'm weird.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.069
And now you're looking at me

18:31.152 --> 18:34.113
like I'm Jesus's
crazy stepbrother Terry.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.782
That's not in the Bible,
is it?

18:35.866 --> 18:36.741
No.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.285
It'd probably be for the best--

18:39.369 --> 18:41.245
Yep.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.873
Got it.

18:44.541 --> 18:47.126
Troll the respawn, Jeremy.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.007
Troll the respawn, Jeremy.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.514
Black, gay, and old?

18:59.597 --> 19:02.350
Oh, I'm not even gonna know
which box to check

19:02.433 --> 19:04.644
on the hate crime form.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.146
Excuse me, pal,
I'm sorry to bother you, but,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.148
well, the last couple of days,
I've been asking myself

19:09.232 --> 19:11.234
some tough questions
about how I treat women.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.486
- Interest level exceeded.
- Wait, wait, wait!

19:13.570 --> 19:17.699
Um, the thing is I-- I think
that I envy women

19:17.782 --> 19:19.325
because they can be with men.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.411
And I've never said this
out loud before,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.955
but I think
that's what I want, too.

19:24.039 --> 19:28.001
So... you want to go out
for a drink sometime?

19:28.085 --> 19:31.004
Are you asking me out, you
tasty little Bob the Builder?

19:31.088 --> 19:33.339
Yeah. I am.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.470
You can't handle this yet.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.597
Still got it!

19:40.680 --> 19:42.933
Call me in ten years.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.060
This is actually supposed
to take that long, so...

19:48.396 --> 19:49.940
Cyndee.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.276
My fiancé and I have decided
to return to Durnsville,

19:53.359 --> 19:54.778
the city that never sleeps.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.988
Is that siren still going off?

20:04.829 --> 20:06.623
Cyndee... I'm sorry.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.877
- Go on.
- You were right.

20:10.961 --> 20:13.880
I'm not doing any of the things
I said I would.

20:13.964 --> 20:17.383
It turns out
I don't even have a boyfriend.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.551
I don't have anything.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.303
It's like in the Bible,

20:20.386 --> 20:23.765
when Terry borrowed
his brother's moped.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.601
Listen to me.
Don't listen to me.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.519
You get to live your life
the way you want.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.314
That's the whole point
of not being in a bunker.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.441
No one gets to tell you
what to do.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.986
And I think part of me
is jealous of you,

20:36.069 --> 20:39.363
because you really do have
everything you want.

20:39.447 --> 20:40.865
You just took a shortcut
to get there,

20:40.949 --> 20:43.367
and I can't do it that way.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.245
You're gonna take
the road less traveled.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.165
I guess so, Cyndee.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.959
Even though that's exactly
how you got kidnapped.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.043
True.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.838
But if I'm going to do
all the things I said I would,

20:54.921 --> 20:56.464
I need to get going.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.549
And I know
where I'm going to start.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.136
[Don't You [Forget about Me]
by Simple Minds]

21:09.519 --> 21:11.604
I'm here to enroll
in the eighth grade.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.730
I'm sorry,
but someone your age

21:12.814 --> 21:14.232
can't enroll in middle school.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.942
But Billy Madison did.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.569
Yes, but Billy Madison's
family was very wealthy.

21:18.653 --> 21:22.699
They owned Madison Hotels,
a Fortune 500 company.

21:22.782 --> 21:27.078
But there is a GED class
that meets here.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.790
This is perfect!

21:30.874 --> 21:32.458
And they have a lacrosse team!

21:32.542 --> 21:34.627
No, those are all
flyswatters.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.006
Look out, world!
Here comes Kimmy!

21:38.089 --> 21:39.590
[music continues]

21:43.261 --> 21:44.554
End of Breakfast Club.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.680
I know what it is.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.015
[music stops abruptly]

22:52.705 --> 22:54.582
Good night, everybody.
