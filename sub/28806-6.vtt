01:46.648 --> 01:48.525
<i>Mom would have loved this.</i>

01:50.401 --> 01:51.903
<i>Not the corpses...</i>

01:54.030 --> 01:57.075
<i>or my near-death encounter
with a shitwad psycho...</i>

01:58.993 --> 02:01.704
<i>but finding said shitwad,</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:05.458
<i>exposing him...</i>

02:06.000 --> 02:08.044
<i>...that's the stuff of heroes.</i>

02:09.461 --> 02:11.089
<i>That's what Mom wanted.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:15.343
<i>Maybe I want it, too.</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:30.483
Jesus.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.197
Address for Gregory Sallinger.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.575
The killer who you followed here.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.952
How'd you get onto Sallinger
in the first place?

02:41.619 --> 02:42.745
Working a case.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.499
Who are the clients? Was there
a specific lead or piece of evidence?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.709
It's privileged.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.002
That's not good enough.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.173
Finding a serial killer,
that's not good enough?

02:53.256 --> 02:55.258
Part of my job is to build a case
against this guy.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.678
I gotta walk the jury through
the investigation, the chain of evidence.

02:58.761 --> 03:02.015
Well, all the evidence I've got
is in that tank.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.936
- But you'll search his place?
- Second I get a warrant.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.689
Check behind the bureau.

03:09.772 --> 03:12.442
You might find something
that helps you put those pieces together.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.824
You single-handedly found a serial killer.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.619
Not bad for a day's work.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.663
I'll come down when you're ready
for my official statement.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.875
Till then, I'll be drunk.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.857
Let's get into Sallinger's apartment
before the cops get a warrant.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.401
- There's got to be a lead.
- The cops are gonna handle it.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.447
Well...
The cops only know what we gave them.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.033
They didn't even know
there was a serial killer for years.

04:02.116 --> 04:05.245
There's heroic shit that we do,
which we've done.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.830
And there's heroic shit that they do,
which they're doing

04:07.914 --> 04:10.041
with resources that we don't have.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.335
And we have resources
that they don't have.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.003
Why pull out now?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.548
Because this piece of shit
tried to kill me, twice.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.801
If he gets off
on some technicality, then...

04:20.551 --> 04:23.721
he's gonna try again, and I'm gonna have
to do something that I don't wanna do.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.307
Oh, damn it.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.060
Mom and that stupid show.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.770
Text.

04:30.853 --> 04:34.357
Got caught up, period.
Cover for me, question mark.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.485
- You should just go.
- Not while he's still out there.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.947
Next time, it could be you in that tank.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.949
"Next time"? So...

04:43.032 --> 04:45.618
- we're still doing this?
- I think you're missing the point.

04:45.702 --> 04:48.538
I get the point.
This is dangerous. I could die.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.331
Okay, you get the point.

04:50.873 --> 04:55.586
Or you could save me, like I saved you,
because we have each other's backs now.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.464
I think you're having
too much fun with this.

04:59.299 --> 05:04.012
And, right now, I really just wanna shower
those dead body parts out of my head.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.890
You're spoiling my shot.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.655
I normally do this
in a private home setting,

06:04.739 --> 06:05.907
which you don't have.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.161
But no one will distract me here.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.122
Distracting you from... from what?

06:16.167 --> 06:19.212
- From your photo shoot.
- Is that what this is?

06:20.630 --> 06:24.842
Looks more like a kill-type situation.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.094
That's incidental.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.639
What I create and capture on film
is the point.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.105
Look, I know I blackmailed you.
That pisses you off.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.691
- You don't want me spilling your secret...
- It's too late for that.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.113
They found my scraps,
so I've had to move on.

06:46.572 --> 06:51.536
I am here to witness the moment
you realize your true worth.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.623
My... my worth?

06:55.706 --> 06:56.541
Hmm.

06:56.624 --> 07:01.003
You are crippled by good looks and charm,

07:01.087 --> 07:04.424
and they afford you a pride
in your underfed mind.

07:05.591 --> 07:11.222
You've teamed with an arrogant alcoholic
who embodies fortune over ability.

07:11.305 --> 07:14.142
She has not earned her powers.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.187
- She's cheated.
- Yeah.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.232
Cheaters suck.

07:21.315 --> 07:26.154
And because she has cheated,
you two were able to do me harm.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.991
Do you see... that this is unfair?

07:31.701 --> 07:33.828
Yes. Fortune over ability.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.495
No.

07:36.747 --> 07:37.999
You don't see it.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.085
Not yet.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.506
Before we begin,
there's something I need to know.

07:48.134 --> 07:52.138
How exactly did you find out about me?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.162
Hey.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.456
Where are you?
Hogarth called an emergency meeting.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.583
I can't make it.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.877
<i>Babe, it's all hands on deck.
We rely on you.</i>

08:23.419 --> 08:24.795
I'm nobody's goddamn errand boy.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.924
Is this you bailing when shit gets real?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.469
I'm not bailing.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.429
I'll come in when I can,
but right now, I gotta run.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.515
Talk later.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.099
Love y...

08:41.520 --> 08:46.025
Peter Lyonne was a troubled man.
Unstable, angry, despairing.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.403
He needed to blame someone, he...

08:50.404 --> 08:51.989
He blamed me.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.826
If I could force the fallout of this
onto me alone, I would.

08:55.910 --> 09:00.456
But, inevitably,
it will spill over onto you as well.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.211
However...

09:08.047 --> 09:13.427
trust me when I say
that this will not define us.

09:14.428 --> 09:18.349
Not one more client
will leave us today. Not one.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.850
You know why?

09:19.934 --> 09:22.603
Because we are the best goddamn lawyers

09:22.687 --> 09:26.232
they will ever have the privilege
of working with.

09:26.816 --> 09:31.988
We know our shit. We know their shit.
And we do not lose.

09:34.031 --> 09:40.162
I want every client contacted, reassured,
bullied, cajoled, whatever it takes.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.249
Do what you do best. Fight.

09:44.208 --> 09:45.251
Go do it.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.090
Zaya.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.345
Any word from Rand?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.514
They're giving me the runaround.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.600
But I'm going there now
to beat down some doors.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.519
There is not a door
strong enough to keep you out.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.606
Careers are made on days like this.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.660
Hey. What happened to you? Where's Berry?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.996
She called her goddamn pimp,
who sucker punched me.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.539
Jesus. So she's back on the street?

10:23.623 --> 10:27.001
I've just spent my entire night searching
street corners and hooker hotels.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.296
I'm just back here to check her priors,
regular haunts, and I got leads, so...

10:30.379 --> 10:35.509
Malcolm, I was just standing knee-deep
in body parts of Sallinger's kills.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.554
- What? You got him?
- Not yet. So she can't be out there alone.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.805
I'm on it.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.891
She works the street corner
of 40th and 10th.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.977
- Copy.
- Maybe she's with Erik.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.071
Erik?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.199
<i>- He traded up.</i>
- He's got me in a commercial...

11:02.078 --> 11:04.413
You touch him, and I'll rip your face off.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.791
That's exactly the level
of discourse I expected.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.837
What do you want?

11:11.921 --> 11:13.714
<i>I want to know how you found me.</i>

11:16.008 --> 11:19.845
Tell me where you are, and I'll come
explain every mistake you've made.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.057
<i>If you can find me, find me.</i>

11:23.140 --> 11:26.310
<i>If not, you can pick up his pieces.</i>

11:40.574 --> 11:43.994
A superhero is after me.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.082
It'd be flattering
if it weren't such hubris.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.093
Time to capture some truth.

12:00.678 --> 12:04.348
Let's start with you being honest
about who you are.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.007
I told you we'd handle it.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.760
I heard you.

12:40.843 --> 12:45.014
Yet here you are.
You have control issues, Jones.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.642
Look, I just... I can't let him get away.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.145
We've got an APB out.
His phone is being tracked.

12:51.228 --> 12:54.188
His neighbors are being canvassed.
The feds are gonna get involved as well.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.751
Costa, I need to know what you've got.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.860
You agreed to let us
carry the ball on this.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.403
That was before.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.489
I changed my mind. I...

13:02.281 --> 13:03.491
What do you have?

13:03.574 --> 13:06.660
Nothing yet. Tell me about the photos
behind the bureau.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.997
- You found it?
- It was full of bleak landscape photos.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.332
But the guy has an eye.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.044
- He cleaned it out.
- What was in it?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.963
Photos of his eight victims.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.131
Jesus.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.884
Seven. You mean seven, not eight.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.845
The coroner counted seven bodies
in that train yard.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.348
We've already ID'd all of them.

13:27.431 --> 13:30.309
Detective Costa? We got press.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.435
Shit!

13:32.686 --> 13:34.313
- Goddamn Internet.
- Hey...

13:35.314 --> 13:37.608
I have copies of the photos
that were in that album.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.903
I'll trade you for that list
of victims' names.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.613
The photos will be inadmissible.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.074
But you have seven bodies.
There are eight victims.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.494
If I know which photo isn't on the list,
I can find the eighth victim.

13:50.079 --> 13:53.541
Back off,
or I will run you in for obstruction.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.308
The names?

14:13.561 --> 14:16.272
Finding the eighth victim
won't necessarily help you find Erik.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.400
I know that, but it's something.
It's more than we had.

14:20.484 --> 14:21.861
Thank you for calling me.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.571
Let's go.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.994
I heard Erik yell
that he's in a commercial something.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.955
Commercial warehouse? Retail building?
Production house?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.583
Well, it'd have to be abandoned
for Sallinger to do his thing.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.169
- That narrows it down, but not by much.
- Don't worry. We'll save him.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.756
All right, you drive,
I'll find the eighth man.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.233
Hey... Hey, where you going?

15:01.317 --> 15:03.611
Get the hell out of here. Get out of here.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.571
What the hell, Malcolm?
What are you doing?

15:05.654 --> 15:06.822
Where's my money?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.699
Hey.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.577
I take a lot of shit,
but not from you, asshole.

15:12.953 --> 15:13.787
You...

15:20.586 --> 15:23.923
All right! All right! Take her.
She's not worth the aggrava...

15:28.469 --> 15:31.138
- Stop! I'll go with you!
- Get off me!

15:31.221 --> 15:33.933
Stop! Okay! Okay, I said I'd go with you!

15:37.853 --> 15:41.190
Are you crazy?
Why did you do that? Why...

15:41.899 --> 15:44.068
A serial killer
just kidnapped your brother.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.153
What?

15:46.236 --> 15:49.365
Erik might already be dead.
Guess who's next?

15:53.243 --> 15:56.538
What? What does that mean? What do I do?

16:18.602 --> 16:20.020
Jeryn Hogarth?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.733
I searched your name
after watching Dad's performance.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.111
Laurent. I'm...

16:28.487 --> 16:30.823
I'm sorry that we're meeting this way.
Kith talks about...

16:30.906 --> 16:32.157
You should go.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.827
I just wanted to check on your mom.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.621
She doesn't want to see you.

16:38.288 --> 16:42.042
She won't tell me what part
you played in this, but you seem awful.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.839
I'll take that, because you're in pain.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.592
But I am not the person
that your father made me out to be.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.597
Well... he was a liar, apparently.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.475
And a cheat, a thief...

17:00.060 --> 17:02.396
So, sure, you're off the hook.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.147
- At least take the bagels.
- Just...

17:05.023 --> 17:07.358
God, I'm sorry. Are you hurt?

17:07.443 --> 17:09.194
- My wrist.
- Here, let me help you.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.529
I can... I can do it.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.907
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I just...

17:15.659 --> 17:18.454
- Are you hurt?
- Just tell your mother that I was here.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.190
Found the eighth man.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.026
It's the only photo
that isn't listed on the victim IDs.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.405
He looks sad. Or maybe sorry.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.533
Either way, we have a face.
Now we just need a name.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.951
Then we'll nail that asshole.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.912
Would you stop saying that?

17:59.995 --> 18:00.996
Saying what?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.499
"We'll save him. We'll nail that asshole."

18:03.582 --> 18:06.460
You should be scared
and worried and pessimistic.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.212
Sounds like you got that covered.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.963
Because I know what the stakes are.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.298
So do I.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.928
What the hell?

18:16.011 --> 18:17.721
It's always Jessica.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.474
Mother, what are you doing here?

18:20.557 --> 18:22.643
I covered for you
at your production meeting,

18:22.726 --> 18:23.811
and I wanted to know why.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.895
Now I do.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.438
Actually, you don't.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.689
So fill me in.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.067
If I'm gonna do your job for you,
I deserve that.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.487
Look, Mom...

18:34.655 --> 18:35.739
So come on in.

18:43.580 --> 18:47.251
Mom, it's complicated
and actually kinda private.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.502
I think you should tell her.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.005
Please don't tell me you're a couple.

18:52.089 --> 18:52.923
What?

18:53.006 --> 18:55.092
There are much better lesbians out there.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.053
Mom, I'm not... We're... No.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.471
Trish has powers.

19:01.223 --> 19:05.686
- What on earth are you talking about?
- She's kidding. Ignore her.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.689
You remember that nightmare experiment
that put Trish in a coma?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.859
Well, turns out... it worked.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.444
I skipped a body wrap
at the Peninsula for this?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.698
She can run up walls.
She can fight. She can kick.

19:17.781 --> 19:18.949
Jess, just stop.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.201
Have you finally
just gone off the deep end?

19:22.744 --> 19:26.415
She can jump off the side of a building
and land on her feet.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.709
- I cannot.
- Sure, you can. I've seen you.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.588
Okay, just stop. You're scaring me now.
You'll give me nightmares.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.671
Good.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.215
That's enough.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.092
Baby, what is she talking about?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.804
What did you do?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.688
I'll give you two a minute.

20:05.495 --> 20:06.622
What the hell?

20:07.164 --> 20:08.332
You're here.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.458
I live here.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.377
- Why aren't you out finding Berry?
- I found her.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.422
- Well, where is she?
- She's on her way.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
Are you shitting me?

20:18.675 --> 20:23.180
She has to choose to come back
for herself, or she will just leave again.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.183
- Now, why did you break my door?
- I need an ID on this guy.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.895
I assumed you had
facial recognition software,

20:29.978 --> 20:31.855
being that you're so well-funded
these days.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.565
So you broke my door?

20:35.275 --> 20:40.530
Look, Erik's life is in danger.
Do you have the software or not?

20:41.907 --> 20:43.700
As it happens. Send me the photo.

20:44.868 --> 20:48.038
You're still paying for that door.
This will take a few.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.767
Why didn't you tell me?

21:11.103 --> 21:14.106
I thought you'd react
the way you're reacting.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.816
What? Hurt?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.568
Horrified?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.446
Afraid?

21:26.076 --> 21:29.746
I mean, I also know how you feel
about powered people.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.374
You've always resented Jessica.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.543
My problem with Jessica isn't her powers.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.878
It's that's she's rude,
violent and ungrateful.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.256
Well, there's that.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.052
I'm sorry about the secrecy.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.096
It's a precaution.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.389
Against what?

21:48.223 --> 21:51.143
You sell polyblends
to the obese and homebound.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.644
I save lives, Mother.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.813
In fact, someone's in danger right now...

21:54.896 --> 21:56.064
Yeah, y... you!

21:56.148 --> 21:58.734
What you're doing is dangerous.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.610
You don't know what I'm capable of.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.529
I know you're capable of dying.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.114
I was there...

22:04.823 --> 22:06.742
...remember?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.619
Mom, Jess and I are a team now.

22:10.495 --> 22:14.666
We're gonna have each other's backs.
We'll be perfectly safe.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.293
Bullshit.

22:16.376 --> 22:20.172
And what happens to me
when you're hurt, or worse?

22:21.089 --> 22:24.384
What happens to the people at work
who all depend on you?

22:24.468 --> 22:26.887
You never gave me a choice in the matter!

22:26.970 --> 22:28.638
You never gave me a choice!

22:28.722 --> 22:30.766
You think you're afraid?

22:30.849 --> 22:35.020
Try being a little kid whose
mother's mood swings end up in bruises.

22:35.103 --> 22:40.609
Or the teen who's pimped out by the person
who is supposed to protect her.

22:42.235 --> 22:46.031
Now I can protect
other little girls from that.

22:46.114 --> 22:50.118
I can protect a lot of people
from a lot of bad things.

22:51.328 --> 22:54.247
I am this way
because you made me this way.

22:57.918 --> 22:58.919
Well...

23:01.421 --> 23:04.549
I had you back for a minute, didn't I?

23:05.759 --> 23:08.970
I was... so happy.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.774
The love of my life...

23:23.151 --> 23:24.736
was in my world again.

23:26.363 --> 23:28.323
Mom...

23:28.407 --> 23:29.991
I'd always worried I'd...

23:31.243 --> 23:32.661
done too much damage.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.705
Turns out I did.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.625
Mom... no...

23:41.628 --> 23:43.338
I'm okay, Mom.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.136
I'm grateful you're back in my life, too.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.638
Mom!

24:00.897 --> 24:02.399
How long is this gonna take?

24:02.482 --> 24:05.986
Well, it's only searching
through the whole damn Internet.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.287
Something's wrong with you.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.417
I'm not sure you're one to judge.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.543
Erik is.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.630
He got a read on you
when we dropped off his sister.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.718
Erik? He's got powers, too?

24:29.801 --> 24:33.555
He sees evil in people, or... something.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.974
Bet he's great at parties.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.979
What happened to you?

24:43.523 --> 24:44.900
I grew up.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.488
Caspar Marx.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.074
Marx is a chef. Well known, actually.
Also alive.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.576
Holy shit.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.079
Get contacts, addresses. Text me.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.292
Where's my brother?

25:07.589 --> 25:09.382
We haven't found him yet.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.971
Bad people, they make him sick.
He can't take it.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.556
I know.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.981
Don't worry. We're gonna save him.

25:35.575 --> 25:39.621
I took advantage of people. I regret that.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.373
I don't think you do.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.833
Um...

25:45.460 --> 25:49.297
I missed so many chances to help people.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.425
I was selfish.

25:53.885 --> 25:54.885
Yeah.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.555
I'm not seeing it.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.101
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

26:01.184 --> 26:03.979
I need an honest assessment
of your falsity.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.274
All I'm seeing now are vanity and lies.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.818
Well, that's bad.

26:09.901 --> 26:13.947
This photograph is to be your apology...

26:16.074 --> 26:21.037
for casting others in shadow while you
soaked up sunlight you didn't deserve.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.585
Is that your sorry face?

26:27.168 --> 26:30.130
It's just... the pain.

26:32.215 --> 26:36.386
The pain helps us focus.
My father and brother taught me that.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.681
Brother? There's more of you?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.349
There's only one of me.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.978
What's his name?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.857
Keep me talking, right?

26:49.649 --> 26:52.902
I'll veer off course,
you'll buy yourself some time.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.238
Underfed mind.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.199
God. You're just like Donny.

27:03.246 --> 27:07.417
Donny... wanted to be a photographer, too.

27:08.585 --> 27:09.836
And my father...

27:12.297 --> 27:14.132
he thought he was a genius.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.759
I guess that he wasn't.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.762
I was the artist.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.098
I even won a contest once.

27:23.558 --> 27:24.934
Dad and Donny...

27:26.061 --> 27:29.064
they said the judges
had chosen the winner at random.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.817
They laughed at how proud I was.

27:33.735 --> 27:37.530
Well, Donny sounds like a real asshole.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.741
He really was.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.535
And worse, he was unintelligent.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.164
I thought when Donny died...

27:48.208 --> 27:50.168
that I would become the favorite.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.922
Yeah, well, odds were in your favor there.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.635
But Dad just said
he wished it had been me.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.555
I doubt he meant that literally.

28:02.639 --> 28:06.184
He stabbed me in the chest
at the funeral luncheon.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.732
You're about to die.

28:14.818 --> 28:17.112
You were given every advantage.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.490
Allowed to make mistake after mistake.

28:21.032 --> 28:24.619
And just like Donny,
you never worked hard...

28:25.203 --> 28:27.080
or made any effort to improve.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.874
It was handed to you.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.795
No longer.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.265
These photographs are shit.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.312
You still think you can lie.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.190
The dishonesty and the fraud
in every word...

29:03.867 --> 29:05.076
What's the matter with you?

29:07.454 --> 29:08.455
Headache.

29:09.372 --> 29:13.084
Happens sometimes
when the serial killer holding me captive

29:13.168 --> 29:14.627
forgets to bring me lunch.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.005
I don't think so.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.440
It's me.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.861
- You're allergic to me.
- That's crazy.

29:39.944 --> 29:40.945
Is it?

29:46.242 --> 29:48.578
Why do I do this to you?

29:51.122 --> 29:53.249
Why? Hmm?

29:55.001 --> 30:00.423
Because I feel your sick, evil...

30:00.507 --> 30:04.344
the void, the hole of black shit.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.846
You're barely human.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.151
You're a cheater.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.447
Surprise.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.663
I hoped Dorothy would talk you out of it.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.499
- It was a long shot.
- It was shitty.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.758
I forgot what it feels like...

30:45.301 --> 30:47.470
being the wreckage that you left behind.

30:50.473 --> 30:54.561
I wouldn't wish that on anybody,
but I still choose this.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.147
Then, you choose it.

30:59.941 --> 31:00.942
There it is.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.034
Uh, hey, Patsy.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.580
- What?
- Exactly. I'll be right back.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.383
Caspar Marx?

31:25.466 --> 31:26.926
We're closed. I'm busy.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.679
No, you're not.

31:32.265 --> 31:36.436
- Where'd you get that? Who are you?
- Jessica Jones, private investigator.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.731
Tell me everything you know
about Gregory Sallinger.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.609
I keep my private life private.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.819
Sallinger kidnapped a friend of mine.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.113
Then, your friend is into some kinky shit.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.824
This isn't rope play.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.370
Sallinger is a serial killer.
People are dead.

31:56.915 --> 31:57.916
I knew it.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.919
I mean, I didn't know it,
but it all makes...

32:01.544 --> 32:05.715
Oh, God. Uh, I need a minute to process...

32:08.676 --> 32:11.054
Tell me everything you know
about Sallinger,

32:11.137 --> 32:12.639
or I'll move on to your fingers.

32:12.722 --> 32:13.848
All right.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.768
Oh, my God. Okay. Um...

32:17.560 --> 32:22.774
Gregory was a regular.
Intense but smart, nice.

32:23.316 --> 32:24.525
"Nice"?

32:24.609 --> 32:27.445
Except the time that his steak was
a little overcooked. That was ugly.

32:27.528 --> 32:30.198
- But I've seen worse.
- So it was a date?

32:31.115 --> 32:34.369
He wanted to photograph me.
It was flattering.

32:34.452 --> 32:39.832
He came by the restaurant after hours.
He brought this... portable photo lab.

32:39.916 --> 32:44.462
He took pictures and then what?
Why are you making this face?

32:44.545 --> 32:47.298
I poured wine, made an amuse-bouche.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.300
Even when he had me in a choke hold,

32:49.384 --> 32:52.345
I thought,
"Okay, we're skipping right to it."

32:52.428 --> 32:55.390
Then I woke up in the kitchen
taped to a chair...

32:55.473 --> 32:57.392
And that didn't raise any red flags?

32:57.475 --> 33:02.647
It was sexy at first.
Abduction scenario, control stuff...

33:02.730 --> 33:04.816
But then he just snapped away,

33:04.899 --> 33:08.903
and the whole time, he complained
about that damn medium-well steak.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.532
He said I was a fraud, that I had
a Michelin star for cooking crap.

33:12.615 --> 33:15.451
I tried to get past the mind games
by kissing him.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.535
And?

33:16.577 --> 33:21.749
He freaked out
like he'd never been kissed by anyone.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.251
He bolted out of there.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.920
The sous chef had to untie me
in the morning.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.755
It was humiliating.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.716
- It saved your life.
- Jesus.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.220
And then what? Did he ever come back here?

33:35.096 --> 33:37.598
Here? No. This was at my old place,
which closed.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.392
It's a shitty location.

33:41.602 --> 33:45.064
A commercial kitchen? Abandoned?

33:47.358 --> 33:48.693
Write down the address.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.113
I made you cry blood.

33:53.614 --> 33:54.907
Does that happen a lot?

33:56.826 --> 33:57.827
No.

33:59.746 --> 34:03.416
And you say it's because I lack empathy,
because I'm evil.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.127
Basically.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.504
Evil is the wrong word.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.550
I am asserting fairness
in an unfair world.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.138
I'm vengeful...

34:18.097 --> 34:21.641
without pity, appropriately cruel.

34:22.185 --> 34:25.521
Those are the things
you're sensing, not evil.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.237
You cheaters...

34:34.655 --> 34:36.616
you all think you're so superior...

34:38.284 --> 34:42.914
but it's just an unfair advantage,
like lifts in your shoes.

34:44.665 --> 34:49.879
All I am is a man
with my feet on the ground

34:49.962 --> 34:51.839
and a brain in my head.

34:52.590 --> 34:58.346
And yet, I can bring pain to power
just by getting close.

34:58.429 --> 35:03.226
I have the only superpower
that is not a fraud,

35:03.309 --> 35:06.479
because it was evolved
through sheer human pain.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.524
And that is extraordinary.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.651
Because it's real.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
Say it.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.699
It's real.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.120
Say I'm real.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.974
Say it!

35:48.104 --> 35:50.523
Shit. Erik, can you hear me?

35:50.606 --> 35:51.816
Are you okay?

35:53.901 --> 35:55.403
Shit.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.884
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

36:21.262 --> 36:22.471
He's coming.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.663
He needs a hospital.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.582
No, no, no, no, no. No people.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.459
Okay.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.170
You get him to Alias.
I'll take care of Sallinger.

36:54.253 --> 36:55.546
Photos.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.717
The cops won't need them.
They've got the bodies.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.262
We'll get rid of 'em.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.766
Asshole never did get my good side.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.119
We work our entire careers...

37:28.871 --> 37:32.500
hoping for a clear-cut piece of shit
like Sallinger...

37:33.251 --> 37:37.672
so when we look at the ledger,
we know we got at least one right.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.132
It's not gonna stick.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.636
Those bodies are clean. No DNA, no prints.

37:43.719 --> 37:44.929
That is not possible.

37:45.012 --> 37:46.847
No physical evidence at his place.

37:47.556 --> 37:50.476
We're holding him
on trespassing right now.

37:50.559 --> 37:55.064
You have me. I'm a witness.
I followed him into that death-hole.

37:55.147 --> 37:56.565
You had eyes on him the whole time?

37:56.649 --> 37:58.651
See his face?
Didn't lose him in that train yard?

37:58.734 --> 38:01.070
- Costa, come on!
- He said you were harassing him,

38:01.153 --> 38:02.953
he hid in the restaurant
to get away from you.

38:03.030 --> 38:03.906
That is bullshit!

38:03.990 --> 38:05.449
I know it's bullshit.

38:09.078 --> 38:12.957
- What really went down in that kitchen?
- I did everything right.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.918
I called you. I brought you in.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.879
It wasn't just you and Sallinger
on the scene. That was obvious.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.091
I am giving you my word, he's the killer.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.176
I know.

38:26.512 --> 38:29.223
The jury's gonna see a stand-up guy,

38:29.307 --> 38:32.768
a volunteer for the community center,
with no priors.

38:32.852 --> 38:35.104
You're a super with a record.

38:35.187 --> 38:38.649
The DA took one look at this case
and passed.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.610
So unless you got another witness...

38:46.991 --> 38:49.952
- How long can you keep him for?
- Overnight.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.038
Don't let him out a second sooner.

38:57.835 --> 39:02.590
This is not a good time to make a change,
not in the middle of your merger.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.259
Of course. You're always our top priority.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.761
I know you know.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.095
Great, we'll be in touch.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.222
Saxon is staying.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.184
Cam, I would hate to see you go,

39:13.267 --> 39:16.187
but Saxon has been demanding
more of our time lately.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.565
Yeah. Of course, Saxon is staying.

39:21.192 --> 39:25.946
Great. I will set up a meeting
so we can go over the merger. Bye.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.657
- Volnar?
- We're in business.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.952
<i>Jeri?</i>

39:34.205 --> 39:36.445
- What's up, Char?
- Tell me she's got Rand on the phone.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.377
It's Jessica Jones.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.174
Call back.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.472
Steven, you're rather premature to gloat.

39:51.555 --> 39:55.601
Gloating isn't my style.
Hi. Steven Benowitz.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.478
Yup, that Benowitz.

39:58.938 --> 40:00.022
Zaya Okonjo.

40:00.106 --> 40:04.235
- Okonjo? I've heard good things.
- That's because I have the best mentor.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.571
Excuse me.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.994
How's your health?
A wrist brace isn't a good sign.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.079
Never better.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.207
You're looking dapper.

40:18.290 --> 40:21.919
Gay, you mean? Yes, very.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.588
Out and proud. Congratulations.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.632
My wife was actually relieved.

40:26.715 --> 40:30.428
And I'm dating someone now.
Thanks for the push.

40:30.511 --> 40:34.765
I'm very pleased for you, but I...
assume that isn't why you're here.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.684
Sadly, no.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.856
I felt I should deliver these personally.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.276
Client transfer papers.

40:45.359 --> 40:46.735
You're poaching one of my clients.

40:46.819 --> 40:50.156
Actually, we're poaching
two-thirds of your business.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.202
Rand. You're...

40:57.329 --> 40:59.748
stealing Rand Enterprises.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.333
I didn't steal Rand.

41:01.417 --> 41:05.546
Oh, yeah, but, uh, Linda,
she sure as hell did, and you let her.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.966
I backed my partner's play.
That's what partners do.

41:09.049 --> 41:12.595
She convinced them they needed
a bigger firm. Then with this scandal...

41:12.678 --> 41:14.680
Danny Rand would never agree to this.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.974
Mr. Rand has been
on some sort of sabbatical.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.518
The board made the decision yesterday.

41:26.192 --> 41:30.905
Jeri, you looked at me
and told me to come out.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.032
I hated you for it.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.658
But you were right.

41:35.242 --> 41:40.539
So now I'm looking at you and saying
slow down, enjoy your life.

41:41.248 --> 41:47.087
Steven, this is my life,
and you're not welcome in it.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.736
Am I alive?

42:11.737 --> 42:12.863
You're alive.

42:16.408 --> 42:17.993
Where's the psycho?

42:18.077 --> 42:20.538
In jail. Jessica brought him in.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.626
She saved my life.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.757
So did you.

42:33.217 --> 42:36.053
I thought you were more of a mood ring
than a telepath.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.847
I know your voice.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.601
You saved me at the bookie's, too.

42:43.936 --> 42:48.232
So, out of gratitude,
you'll never tell a soul, right?

42:50.276 --> 42:51.944
I'm glad that I didn't know before.

42:52.027 --> 42:55.447
I would have told that maniac anything
to get him the hell away from me.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.783
Well, that doesn't fill me
with confidence.

42:58.742 --> 42:59.743
Hey.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.414
Gratitude...

43:04.331 --> 43:05.499
nothing but.

43:06.125 --> 43:08.043
And silence.

43:12.881 --> 43:14.008
Thank you.

43:17.678 --> 43:19.597
I don't hear that very often.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.600
It's the downside to fighting crime
in a ski mask.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.394
It's a scarf.

43:26.478 --> 43:29.940
Erik! Erik? Shithead!
Where are you, Erik?

43:30.024 --> 43:32.568
Oh, you shithead!

43:33.068 --> 43:36.280
Oh, you scared the hell out of me. God.

43:36.989 --> 43:39.158
Oh, yeah, you're still stuck with me.

43:41.076 --> 43:42.620
Shithead.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.704
Asshole.

43:45.706 --> 43:48.751
- What did he do to you?
- Hey.

43:48.834 --> 43:51.295
- You want the gory details?
- Christ, no.

43:51.378 --> 43:54.006
- Okay, he did nothing.
- Mmm-hmm. Liar.

43:54.089 --> 43:56.842
He wouldn't give me lunch.
My blood sugar was in the toilet.

43:56.925 --> 43:57.926
Better.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.435
Hey, you can't just go in there.

44:07.019 --> 44:10.856
Hypothetically, if I have a client
who's dabbled in blackmailing,

44:10.939 --> 44:13.651
but now he could help
put away a bigger bad guy,

44:13.734 --> 44:16.070
could my client get immunity
for his testimony?

44:16.153 --> 44:20.157
You are not my investigator or my client.
I am done giving out free legal advice.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.202
I found a serial killer.
Those bodies in the train yard.

44:23.911 --> 44:24.745
That was you?

44:24.828 --> 44:27.414
Problem is the cops can't pin it
on the killer. He's too careful.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.376
But my blackmailer could help
get him locked up for kidnapping.

44:31.001 --> 44:33.462
Well, that's a much lesser sentence
than mass murder.

44:33.545 --> 44:35.089
Well, I can't get him on mass murder.

44:35.172 --> 44:38.008
I can get him on assault or kidnapping
or reckless endangerment,

44:38.092 --> 44:42.388
but that's if my client testifies,
if he gets immunity.

44:43.472 --> 44:45.891
Decent lawyer could probably get
your client down to a year.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.601
Even for putting away a serial killer?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.311
He's a blackmailer, Jessica.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.736
- Jail time for a year, huh?
- Yeah, hypothetically.

44:58.570 --> 45:00.322
You're welcome.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.158
Sorry. She practically mowed me down.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.496
Find out everything you can
on those train yard bodies.

45:07.579 --> 45:08.706
On the what?

45:08.789 --> 45:10.499
- Look it up.
- Okay.

45:22.177 --> 45:23.971
You didn't get enough
of a workout with Gor?

45:24.596 --> 45:26.348
I just want to feel something else.

45:29.143 --> 45:31.103
Why? What's wrong with you?

45:35.691 --> 45:37.860
You know, you're the second person
to ask me that.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.070
And you don't have an answer?

45:45.951 --> 45:47.202
I don't know.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.164
That's the answer.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.041
Hmm.

45:55.043 --> 45:58.130
Just,
I've done some things, and...

45:59.923 --> 46:01.842
you know, it's not who I want to be.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.303
Who do you want to be?

46:06.346 --> 46:07.931
Someone who's effective...

46:09.767 --> 46:11.435
who... who takes care of people...

46:12.561 --> 46:13.604
Hmm.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.484
A man.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.904
You beat the shit out of Gor.
That's manly.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.363
That's not how I define it.

46:26.366 --> 46:28.744
- Hey. Whoa, wait.
- This is how I define it.

46:28.827 --> 46:32.414
- No... What are you doing?
- Just reminding you you're a man.

46:32.498 --> 46:35.459
- No, I don't want you to do that.
- I think...

46:36.502 --> 46:37.711
I think you do.

46:41.423 --> 46:42.633
Hmm?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.969
It's just a business arrangement.
I had the same thing with Gor.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.179
I am not like Gor.

46:47.262 --> 46:51.642
No, you're more... brutal.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.585
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:20.796 --> 47:21.797
How is he?

47:22.589 --> 47:23.757
Better than he was.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.926
Yeah, bar was pretty low.

47:28.428 --> 47:29.763
What's the good news?

47:35.269 --> 47:36.270
Well...

47:38.647 --> 47:42.025
The killer's DNA isn't on the body.
There's no hard evidence.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.861
- Sallinger's gonna walk.
- What?

47:43.944 --> 47:46.196
Where's my sister?
We're getting out of here.

47:46.280 --> 47:50.075
No, he's not getting out
until the morning, and I have a plan.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.037
We're gonna get him on kidnapping.

47:54.621 --> 47:55.664
For taking Erik.

47:55.747 --> 47:57.916
You make a deal
in exchange for your testimony.

47:58.000 --> 48:02.462
You'll serve maybe a year
for your... prior infractions.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.090
Like getting Capone on tax evasion.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.009
I can't do it.

48:07.759 --> 48:09.636
How many years for kidnapping?

48:09.720 --> 48:10.554
Erik.

48:10.637 --> 48:11.847
I can't.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.809
Wait. What do you mean, you can't?

48:15.893 --> 48:17.102
It would kill me.

48:18.312 --> 48:19.938
I'm sure it would suck, but...

48:20.022 --> 48:23.233
I barely survived a day with Sallinger.

48:23.317 --> 48:26.737
We're talking about a year
with hundreds of Sallingers?

48:26.820 --> 48:29.031
I mean...
But they would put you in solitary.

48:29.114 --> 48:31.742
- You'd parole out in a few months.
- No, I can't.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.327
You won't.

48:33.410 --> 48:34.410
Trish.

48:34.453 --> 48:36.013
If it was me, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

48:36.038 --> 48:39.082
Yeah, because you chose this.
I chose this.

48:41.668 --> 48:42.753
But he didn't.

48:50.135 --> 48:53.221
Don't ever lecture me
on knowing what the stakes are again.

49:00.562 --> 49:01.563
Tomorrow?

49:04.274 --> 49:05.734
We start at the beginning.

49:14.618 --> 49:15.827
I'm sorry.

49:17.245 --> 49:19.998
Yeah, well, I would've been sorry
if we found you in pieces.

49:21.792 --> 49:22.793
Yeah?

49:22.876 --> 49:24.211
Yeah.

49:27.673 --> 49:28.715
It was something...

49:30.300 --> 49:32.177
seeing you bust in like that.

49:34.429 --> 49:37.140
I get it now. Why you do it.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.143
And why is that?

49:41.812 --> 49:44.898
Because it's... it's who you are.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.194
And not doing it would be a lie.

49:58.662 --> 50:02.916
You mind... moving closer?

50:05.502 --> 50:07.671
You're like aspirin to me.

50:09.923 --> 50:11.550
Worst come-on line ever.

50:14.302 --> 50:17.472
It's the whole hero vibe.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.231
It helps.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.581
Sallinger's just getting started.

50:51.089 --> 50:52.549
He talked about you.
