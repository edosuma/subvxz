You don't mind if I
change this, do you?

00:17.550 --> 00:19.950
Yes, I do mind.
Come on.
You're not gonna make me

00:19.950 --> 00:22.980
listen to another chorus
of some gal losing her guy

00:22.990 --> 00:25.150
to some pickup truck
named Lucille?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.420
At least you can
understand the words.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.090
That's more than I can say
about your music.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.730
What, this is the tape
that C.D. got you?

00:31.730 --> 00:32.990
Merrilee Summers.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.830
Hey, she's pretty good-looking.
Look at that.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.030
Hey, I'm trying to drive.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.430
"Take My Word For It."

00:37.430 --> 00:39.330
I don't have to
take your word for it.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.340
C.D. plays her video
over and over again.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.500
He's like a child
with his first crush.

00:44.510 --> 00:47.070
Well, he's excited about her
playing at the bar and grill.

TRIVETTE:
Hey, how long
has he been up there?

01:06.130 --> 01:08.800
Climbed out there
just shy on 10 minutes ago.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.100
Bank here
foreclosed on his ranch.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.130
Just broke down
and bawled like a baby.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.540
Then, next thing you know--
Yeah. Hey, look,

01:15.540 --> 01:17.100
call 911, all right?
All right?

01:17.110 --> 01:19.110
Tell them the Texas Rangers
are on it.

01:25.510 --> 01:27.250
TRIVETTE:
Why didn't you
wait for me?

01:27.250 --> 01:29.120
'Cause I don't think
this guy's gonna wait.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.590
Hey, buddy.

01:34.590 --> 01:35.960
Don't!

01:35.960 --> 01:37.490
Don't come
any closer.

01:37.490 --> 01:40.130
All right. Just take it easy.
We just want to talk.

01:40.130 --> 01:43.360
There's nothing to talk about.
Nothing at all.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.130
Look, it can't be
as bad as all that.

01:45.130 --> 01:46.630
Let's discuss it.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.900
Walker, let me handle this.
I know how to talk to this guy.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.000
Are you sure?
Yeah.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.610
He wants attention.
He wants to be saved.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.140
Otherwise,
he'd have jumped already.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.910
I don't know, Trivette.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.040
Yeah. Watch and learn.

01:58.050 --> 01:59.110
Hey.

01:59.110 --> 02:01.410
Hey, don't!
I-I'll jump, I swear it.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.120
I can dig it, buddy,
all right?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.720
Now, look,

02:04.720 --> 02:06.750
I know you think

02:06.760 --> 02:08.419
that it's the end
of everything, all right?

02:08.419 --> 02:10.389
But you're gonna find

02:10.389 --> 02:11.390
you got a lot
to live for.

02:11.390 --> 02:12.460
Yeah?

02:12.460 --> 02:15.160
Now, everybody's
had bad breaks.

02:16.630 --> 02:19.130
Now, if you talk to me,

02:19.130 --> 02:20.970
you're gonna find...

02:20.970 --> 02:22.700
that just maybe...

02:25.340 --> 02:29.080
Maybe I've had just as many
bad breaks as you have.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.610
All right.
What's going on?

02:35.280 --> 02:38.950
I can't have kids.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.920
Not ever, the doctor said.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.530
So my wife left me.

02:45.530 --> 02:46.690
( sobs )

02:46.700 --> 02:49.030
Then my pa died.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.670
And on his deathbed,
he called me a fool

02:52.670 --> 02:55.240
and he said I was going to
lose the farm, which I did.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.070
What happened
to you this week?

02:58.640 --> 03:01.110
And talking to you,
it all makes sense.

03:01.110 --> 03:02.310
I'm gonna do it!

03:02.310 --> 03:03.540
No, wait!
No, wait, wait, wait!

03:03.550 --> 03:05.510
I just got one more
thing to say, one more thing.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.710
What?

03:07.880 --> 03:10.820
What are you doing?

03:10.820 --> 03:13.320
Now, you want to kill
yourself, right?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.990
But you don't want to take
an innocent guy with you.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.260
Suit yourself.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.360

03:30.840 --> 03:32.810
Don't let go, Walker.

03:37.350 --> 03:40.350
Oh, don't you
let go, Walker. Oh!

03:43.650 --> 03:45.590
Mama... Oh.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.830

03:56.970 --> 03:58.830
Well, it worked
for Mel Gibson

03:58.830 --> 04:00.470
in <i> Lethal Weapon.</i>

04:00.470 --> 04:03.770
Trivette,
that was a movie.

04:08.610 --> 04:11.750
(<i> rock action theme playing</i> )

04:57.290 --> 04:59.330
TRIVETTE:
You sold this thing out
in three hours?

05:00.660 --> 05:03.000
There you go.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.230
Yeah. I sold this thing out
in three hours.

05:05.230 --> 05:07.330
Biggest thing I ever saw
in my life.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.400
People gonna be clamoring
in here.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.710
I guess I'm gonna
have to ask Merrilee

05:11.710 --> 05:13.210
to do me a couple
of extra shows.

05:13.210 --> 05:14.610
Merrilee?

05:14.610 --> 05:17.080
Merrilee?
First-name basis already.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.280
( Trivette laughing )

05:19.280 --> 05:21.580
C.D.:
When I found out that
Ethan was representing her,

05:21.580 --> 05:23.180
I could've got
down on my knees

05:23.180 --> 05:25.890
to beg him to get
her in this place.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.090
When she said yes,

05:27.090 --> 05:30.490
hey, I shed
real tears of joy.

05:30.490 --> 05:32.060
Boy, you got it bad.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.530
Well, she is pretty, all right.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.130
And smart and let me
tell you this,

05:36.130 --> 05:37.330
very, very friendly.

05:37.330 --> 05:38.630
You haven't even met her yet.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.530
Well, I just know,
that's how I know.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.700
When's she supposed
to get here anyway?

05:44.140 --> 05:45.240
Any minute.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.810
( sighs )

05:46.810 --> 05:49.140
Lord, I hope she
hasn't changed her mind.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.580
She ain't gonna change her mind.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.550
She's a woman, ain't she?

05:55.650 --> 05:59.620

06:02.060 --> 06:03.090

06:06.590 --> 06:08.060
Well, well, well.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.800
What the hell
is all this?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.230
Oh, Wayland, can't you
leave us alone?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.840
Wayland, we're tired of this.
You're terrorizing Merrilee.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.570
You back off, old man.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.170
You're her business manager.
This is family matter.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.210
Now, you're not my family
anymore, Wayland.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.780
Nobody walks out on me,
precious. Nobody.

06:26.450 --> 06:27.480
Hey, Merrilee.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.750
Hey, Bobby.

06:28.750 --> 06:31.150
Would you please tell
your boss to leave us alone?

06:31.150 --> 06:32.590
Come on, let's get out--
Bobby,

06:32.590 --> 06:34.520
I will get when I'm ready
to get, all right?

06:34.520 --> 06:35.920
Oh! Wayland--

06:35.920 --> 06:37.560
All I want to do is talk.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.290
I'm all talked out, Wayland.
I got nothing left to say.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.060
Well, maybe I got
something to say, Merrilee.

06:42.060 --> 06:44.330
Okay. Shh, baby. Okay.

06:44.330 --> 06:48.340
You just-- You just tell me
what you want from me.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.540
I just...

06:50.540 --> 06:53.370
I want a second chance.

06:53.370 --> 06:55.810
Come on, baby.
Baby, just another chance.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.110
We're family.
I want my family back.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.710
And I know I can make it,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.810
but you gotta try, Merrilee.
You gotta try.

07:01.820 --> 07:03.220
I did try, Wayland.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.320
( sighs )

07:04.320 --> 07:05.750
For too hard, and too long.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.220
Now, that's why we're divorced.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.020
Now, please,
you have got to leave me be.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.830
Well...

07:12.830 --> 07:14.490
( sniffs)

07:14.500 --> 07:17.200
I ain't-- I ain't
never gonna leave you be.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.800
Mm-- Oof!

07:22.340 --> 07:23.870
Till we're both
dead and buried.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.110
See ya.

07:30.010 --> 07:31.450
I'm sorry, Merrilee.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.410
Oh, Bobby.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.460
Let's go.
Get the hell out of here.

we'll just come back.

to meet you too.

Hi.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.900
Will you excuse them both?
Yeah.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.270
It won't be hard, I'm sure.
C.D.: I know it will.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.570
Uh, I would really
like to thank you for, uh,

12:21.570 --> 12:23.470

12:23.470 --> 12:25.070
C.D., I am so sorry
about all that.

they just can't keep
their personal problems at home.

Yes.

any personal problems.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.530
C.D., can I ask a favor?

12:50.530 --> 12:53.300
Would you mind running
and finding Ethan and tell him

12:53.300 --> 12:55.070
that I'll be ready to go
in a couple of minutes?

12:55.070 --> 12:56.370

12:56.370 --> 12:57.900
a couple guys over to the motel,

12:57.910 --> 12:59.910
and he said, well, ahem,

12:59.910 --> 13:01.010
maybe I could take you home.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.780
Why, that'd be just fine.
Course now--

He made me feel so good
