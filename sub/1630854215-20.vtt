00:01.070 --> 00:03.003
[Lea] Previously on
The Good Doctor...

00:03.037 --> 00:06.282
I've been thinking,
and I need a break
from our coffees.

00:06.316 --> 00:08.663
If you don't value
what the nurses do,

00:08.698 --> 00:10.493
how much can you
care about me?

00:10.527 --> 00:13.185
-[Dr. Lim] This is my patient.
-[Dr. Andrews]
And I'm your boss.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.808
You can either do this with me,
or I'll find someone who will.

00:17.707 --> 00:20.503
If you don't trust me,
fire me.

00:20.537 --> 00:23.230
And if you do,
then stay out of my way.

00:23.264 --> 00:24.886
Are you trying
to pick your embryo?

00:24.921 --> 00:29.029
I'm leaning towards a girl.
I have a playbook to work from.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.686
I didn't OD because of you.
Or us.

00:31.721 --> 00:34.172
Jordan, if I let myself
get close to you,

00:34.206 --> 00:35.725
I will fall for you.

00:35.759 --> 00:37.761
I can't risk that.

00:37.796 --> 00:40.040
You deserve somebody
who's ready to fully commit,

00:40.074 --> 00:41.662
somebody who
makes you happy.

00:41.696 --> 00:44.665
Your brain cancer
may have returned.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.530
The crib needs to be assembled.

00:47.564 --> 00:50.015
Go. I got this.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.260
There are
two screws missing.

00:53.294 --> 00:55.883
Dr. Glassman
doesn't have brain cancer,

00:55.917 --> 00:59.059
but there is something wrong
with his brain.

01:01.785 --> 01:04.098
Lea forgot to add
the blueberries,

01:04.132 --> 01:05.926
but we can still
put them on top.

01:05.962 --> 01:07.170
Sorry.

01:07.205 --> 01:08.516
Not a problem.

01:08.551 --> 01:10.449
Underneath, on top,
on the side.

01:10.484 --> 01:12.106
I can eat them here.
I can eat them there.

01:12.141 --> 01:13.383
I can eat them anywhere.

01:15.937 --> 01:18.216
Not Dr. Seuss fans.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.907
We need to discuss something
very important.

01:19.941 --> 01:22.116
After we eat.

01:22.151 --> 01:24.049
Don't worry, I'm fine,
the baby's fine.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.224
Shaun just wanted to have
a bit of a discussion--

01:26.258 --> 01:29.917
You forgot two screws
when you built the crib.

01:29.951 --> 01:32.195
-Okay.
-Okay, Shaun, slow down.

01:32.229 --> 01:33.817
Let's all at least
take a seat first.

01:33.852 --> 01:36.268
We're gonna have a discussion
about a crib?

01:36.303 --> 01:39.926
Your CSF DNA test
showed your brain cancer
has not returned,

01:39.961 --> 01:41.308
but there is
clearly something

01:41.342 --> 01:43.137
impacting your
neurological function.

01:43.172 --> 01:44.794
[chuckles]

01:44.828 --> 01:48.591
Shaun, the crib has like
100 different parts

01:48.625 --> 01:50.765
and instructions
without any words.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.389
Just pictures with arrows going
in every possible direction.

01:53.423 --> 01:56.564
Okay. Thankfully, I was there
to correct your mistake,

01:56.598 --> 01:59.015
but that won't always
be possible in the O.R.

02:02.260 --> 02:03.399
The O.R.?

02:03.433 --> 02:05.504
Yes.

02:05.539 --> 02:07.920
-I would like to do more tests.
-That's not gonna happen.

02:07.955 --> 02:09.990
-That's not gonna happen.
-And... And Dr. Lim
should be notified.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.993
That's absolutely
not gonna happen!

02:12.028 --> 02:14.030
If your executive function
has deteriorated

02:14.064 --> 02:15.963
-even a small percentage--
-Shaun, just one second.

02:15.997 --> 02:18.068
Just stop for a second.

02:18.103 --> 02:20.140
Two screws?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.934
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

02:21.969 --> 02:23.626
There's nothing wrong
with any part of my body,

02:23.660 --> 02:26.007
for that matter,
not that that concerns you.

02:26.042 --> 02:29.494
You go to Lim, and you're
gonna look ridiculous.

02:29.528 --> 02:31.461
-Doctor--
-That's the end
of the discussion!

02:34.947 --> 02:36.121
And breakfast.

02:40.332 --> 02:43.853
[door opens and closes]

02:43.887 --> 02:44.957
He's right.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.787
It's okay.
You were just trying--

02:46.821 --> 02:48.892
I can't go to Dr. Lim

02:48.927 --> 02:52.172
without conclusive
medical evidence.

02:52.862 --> 02:55.382
Or maybe he was right.

02:55.416 --> 02:57.832
It is just a crib,
and he was in a rush.

02:57.867 --> 03:01.215
Everyone forgets things.
I-I forgot the blueberries.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.217
Instead of tests,

03:03.252 --> 03:06.462
I can gather data
through direct observation.

03:06.496 --> 03:08.015
What does that mean?

03:08.049 --> 03:09.534
Are you gonna spy
on him?

03:09.568 --> 03:11.743
Please put my pancakes
in the fridge.

03:11.777 --> 03:13.400
I will eat them
for dinner.

03:18.922 --> 03:20.061
Good morning.

03:20.096 --> 03:22.995
Mind if I join you?

03:23.030 --> 03:24.411
Sure.

03:28.622 --> 03:30.037
How are things in surgical?

03:32.971 --> 03:35.317
-Great.
-Great, as in, actually great?

03:35.353 --> 03:37.734
Or great, as in,
"I'm saying the right thing

03:37.769 --> 03:39.702
because he's the president
of the hospital"?

03:41.462 --> 03:42.567
Both.

03:42.601 --> 03:43.982
Well, any feedback
you have,

03:44.016 --> 03:45.535
you can always come to me.

03:48.642 --> 03:50.333
Sorry to interrupt.
I have a clinic patient

03:50.368 --> 03:52.128
who needs
a surgical consult.

03:52.162 --> 03:54.993
It's a former patient of yours,
Eddie Richter.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.166
Eddie?

03:56.201 --> 03:58.238
I haven't seen him
in years.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.412
He came in with GI pain
and acid reflux.

04:00.447 --> 04:03.173
Ultrasound reveals a small mass
on his duodenum.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.245
He'll need surgery
to remove it.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.626
I think I can fit that in.
Join me.

04:09.076 --> 04:11.078
Dr. Lim scheduled us
with Dr. Park today.

04:11.112 --> 04:12.873
Doctors Park and Lim
will understand.

04:12.907 --> 04:14.288
This is a unique case.

04:16.325 --> 04:17.947
A small duodenal mass?

04:17.981 --> 04:19.466
I don't know.

04:23.884 --> 04:25.126
Eddie!

04:27.681 --> 04:29.407
-[chuckles]
-Long time no see.

04:29.441 --> 04:31.271
I wish it were longer.
No offense.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.169
I wasn't planning on
seeing a surgeon today.

04:33.203 --> 04:35.758
[Dr. Andrews] Yeah,
yeah, fair enough.
I've brought along with me

04:35.792 --> 04:38.207
Doctors Allen and Wolke
to assist.

04:38.243 --> 04:40.245
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.798
Judging by
the astonishment

04:41.832 --> 04:43.283
they are both
desperately trying to hide,

04:43.317 --> 04:45.146
you did not tell them
about my condition.

04:45.181 --> 04:47.804
I did not.
Very few residents get to see

04:47.839 --> 04:51.187
Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis
outside of a textbook,

04:51.221 --> 04:54.190
and I figured this
would be an important
learning opportunity.

04:54.224 --> 04:56.088
They definitely failed
the bedside manner part.

04:56.123 --> 04:57.573
I'm sorry.

04:57.607 --> 05:00.023
Eh, heartthrobs like me
and Brad Pitt are used to it.

05:01.818 --> 05:04.338
[theme music playing]

05:13.968 --> 05:16.108
Any deep pain
or tenderness here?

05:16.143 --> 05:17.317
A little.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.456
[Dr. Andrews] How's business?

05:18.490 --> 05:20.665
Oh, fantastic.
Thank the Lord.

05:20.699 --> 05:22.322
Eddie is
an amazing carpenter.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.530
He built Isabel and I

05:23.564 --> 05:27.603
this stunning mahogany
live edge dining table.

05:27.637 --> 05:32.262
I have no idea what that is,
but it sounds delightful.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.264
Yeah.
Not much good for guitar,

05:34.299 --> 05:36.336
but I can still wield
a power tool.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.957
You'll need to use
a carotid pulse monitor

05:37.992 --> 05:39.304
and upper thigh for BP.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.617
Got it.

05:41.651 --> 05:43.343
How painful
are the growths?

05:43.377 --> 05:46.138
I mean, that depends.
They're basically just
huge warts,

05:46.173 --> 05:47.968
so face, not much.

05:48.002 --> 05:49.314
Hands, a little.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.659
Feet, a lot.

05:51.799 --> 05:53.456
I'm blessed.

05:53.491 --> 05:54.699
The Lord knows
that a pretty face

05:54.733 --> 05:56.804
can only get
a handyman in trouble.

05:56.839 --> 06:00.532
Dr. Reznick gave us
a really good view
with her ultrasound,

06:00.567 --> 06:03.846
but I'd like an MRI
and a biopsy to better
assess the lesion.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.193
Ah, might as well get
my money's worth, huh?

06:06.227 --> 06:07.884
It's good
seeing you, Eddie.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.547
The team doc's
playing it safe.

06:15.582 --> 06:16.893
It was a damn curveball.

06:16.928 --> 06:19.171
Well, even a damn
double-A curveball

06:19.206 --> 06:21.311
comes in
at, what, 80, 85?

06:21.346 --> 06:23.452
It can still do some damage,
helmet or no.

06:23.486 --> 06:25.937
Two weeks isn't a long time
to be in concussion protocol.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.905
Okay, well, I-I didn't
have a concussion.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.011
I mean, I barely even had
a headache, so...

06:33.358 --> 06:34.773
Can I help you,
Dr. Murphy?

06:34.808 --> 06:37.673
I came to observe.
Please continue.

06:41.297 --> 06:44.024
Your ImPACT scores
are a bit worse than baseline.

06:44.058 --> 06:45.163
Okay, that's one test.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.131
I mean, I-I passed
all the others,

06:48.166 --> 06:50.133
but the doc still
won't clear me.

06:50.168 --> 06:51.963
It's not a bad idea
to play it safe, though.

06:51.997 --> 06:53.447
It is your brain
we're talking about.

06:53.482 --> 06:56.519
I mean, you're an outfielder,
so you don't need one
just now...

06:56.554 --> 06:59.764
-[snickers]
-...but you are gonna
retire someday.

06:59.798 --> 07:01.697
Look, if I don't get back
on the field ASAP,

07:01.731 --> 07:03.526
I won't have a career
to retire from.

07:05.770 --> 07:08.393
I wouldn't have come
to the best brain doctor
in town otherwise.

07:09.912 --> 07:11.327
Alright.
We'll take a look.

07:13.674 --> 07:16.056
Do a neuro
and get me an MRI.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.472
An MRI?
For a concussion?

07:18.507 --> 07:20.957
Well, he's got some dilation
of his left pupil.

07:20.992 --> 07:23.166
Probably not significant,

07:23.201 --> 07:25.790
but if we're gonna override
the team doctor,

07:25.824 --> 07:27.895
we better be sure, hmm?

07:27.930 --> 07:30.311
-On it.
-The MRI is a good idea.

07:30.346 --> 07:32.210
I did not notice
the dilated pupil.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.383
Well, thank you.

07:33.418 --> 07:35.316
Not a problem
since it's not your case.

07:35.351 --> 07:36.939
But it is
an interesting case,

07:36.973 --> 07:39.113
even if I did not know that
when I came here.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.012
Since I've cleared
my schedule,

07:41.046 --> 07:42.600
I would like
to continue observing.

07:42.634 --> 07:45.395
You cleared your schedule
of people with actual ailments?

07:45.430 --> 07:47.121
Mmm.

07:47.156 --> 07:48.951
Okay, fine.
Observe all you want.

07:48.985 --> 07:50.504
I will.

07:50.539 --> 07:52.023
Both you and the case.

07:53.990 --> 07:57.787
Oh, there's no bleeding
or hematoma in your groin,

07:57.822 --> 08:00.756
which means
you're doing fantastic.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.620
[chuckles softly]

08:02.654 --> 08:04.414
Her color looks better.

08:04.449 --> 08:07.279
Everything looks better.

08:07.314 --> 08:10.110
I just got off the phone
with Eden's social worker.

08:10.144 --> 08:12.181
She's having trouble
finding foster parents

08:12.215 --> 08:14.597
who are willing to take
a newborn with Turner Syndrome.

08:14.632 --> 08:15.840
Well, it's not
that difficult.

08:15.874 --> 08:18.221
Her long-term symptoms
might not even be that severe.

08:18.256 --> 08:21.949
Still, Eden will always
need special care.

08:21.984 --> 08:24.296
[Eden grunts]

08:29.232 --> 08:32.615
It'll take a minute for
the lidocaine to take effect.

08:32.650 --> 08:34.341
You may feel some discomfort

08:34.375 --> 08:36.101
when the scope
goes down your throat.

08:36.135 --> 08:38.309
Got it.

08:38.345 --> 08:41.244
I assume you've discussed
surgical removal

08:41.279 --> 08:43.661
of your EV growths
with Dr. Andrews?

08:43.695 --> 08:45.076
Yeah.
No, he wanted to try,

08:45.110 --> 08:47.285
but obviously, there's the risk
of nerve damage,

08:47.319 --> 08:49.701
plus they would
just grow back.

08:49.736 --> 08:52.083
This is how
I was meant to be.

08:52.117 --> 08:54.050
Lord works
in mysterious ways.

08:54.085 --> 08:55.431
But surgeons don't.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.159
The risk of nerve damage
is actually quite small,

08:59.193 --> 09:02.472
and I'd imagine easier
to live with than the pain

09:02.507 --> 09:04.371
and lack
of mobility and--

09:04.405 --> 09:05.855
Repulsiveness?

09:06.373 --> 09:08.340
No, no. I-I was--

09:08.375 --> 09:10.308
It's alright.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.516
I know how I look.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.831
I see the frightened kids,
people laughing,

09:15.865 --> 09:17.108
staring.

09:18.454 --> 09:20.042
I just try my best to keep
my eyes and arms open

09:20.076 --> 09:21.871
to all of God's gifts.

09:25.461 --> 09:29.430
Cannot imagine taking
an 80-mile-an-hour baseball
to the dome.

09:29.465 --> 09:31.053
Some guys in the majors
throw over 100.

09:31.087 --> 09:32.226
Phew.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.403
I don't see any edema
or evidence of a hematoma.

09:37.128 --> 09:38.578
Neither do I.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.614
The anisocoria's
probably harmless.

09:40.649 --> 09:43.479
Twenty percent of people
actually have one pupil
larger than the other.

09:45.654 --> 09:46.931
You play any sports?

09:46.965 --> 09:49.658
I played football and baseball
in high school. Why?

09:49.692 --> 09:53.213
I have a friend
who runs a sports program
for at-risk teens.

09:53.247 --> 09:55.008
I've been helping coaching
some indoor football,

09:55.042 --> 09:57.286
I mean soccer.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.495
She's always looking for help
from positive role models.

09:59.529 --> 10:02.567
Yeah, I've...
I've never
coached kids before.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.363
Mainly just making sure
they have fun and
stay off the streets.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.020
And my friend's super cool.

10:07.054 --> 10:08.780
She's cute, too.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.613
Well, helping kids
sounds great,

10:13.647 --> 10:15.200
but I'm trying to get
a year in recovery

10:15.235 --> 10:16.581
before I start dating.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.755
Damn, my bad.

10:17.789 --> 10:19.273
Oh, it's no big deal.
I just--

10:19.308 --> 10:21.586
No, I mean the...
The anisocoria.

10:25.176 --> 10:27.488
Definitely not harmless.

10:27.523 --> 10:29.352
Or a concussion.

10:35.807 --> 10:37.429
You have multiple
cerebral aneurysms,

10:37.464 --> 10:39.362
which puts you in danger
of a brain hemorrhage.

10:41.779 --> 10:43.297
So, what now?

10:43.332 --> 10:45.610
Well, we're gonna map
the precise vessels involved,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.061
take some pictures
of the inside of your brain.

10:48.095 --> 10:50.270
It's called a...

10:50.304 --> 10:53.135
Cerebral angiogram.

10:53.169 --> 10:54.619
We'll feed a catheter
into your brain

10:54.654 --> 10:55.827
through an artery
in your wrist.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.311
You'll be sedated.
It's harmless.

10:57.346 --> 11:00.107
As soon as we get the results,
we'll map out a surgical plan.

11:01.868 --> 11:02.972
B-Brain surgery?

11:03.007 --> 11:06.113
Hey. Best brain doc
in town, right?

11:12.982 --> 11:14.156
[Asher] It just
keeps getting worse.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.814
The tumor has significantly
damaged the bile duct.

11:16.848 --> 11:18.608
Eddie's gonna need
a surgical resection

11:18.643 --> 11:21.128
or possibly a major
GI reconstruction.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.578
The poor guy.

11:22.612 --> 11:25.132
As if one rare and devastating
disease wasn't enough.

11:25.167 --> 11:27.825
Well, the surgery
is manageable.

11:27.859 --> 11:29.861
I've known Eddie for years.
He's always been the embodiment

11:29.896 --> 11:32.070
of, "What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger."

11:32.105 --> 11:33.313
Who needs strength

11:33.347 --> 11:35.177
when you're cradled
in the Lord's loving arms?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.111
Given his situation,
don't you think his,

11:38.145 --> 11:42.046
"I'm just thankful for
all God's gifts" attitude's
just a bit crazy?

11:42.080 --> 11:44.704
I find the strength
he draws from his faith
very inspiring.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.084
Except that his faith
has inspired him

11:46.119 --> 11:48.259
to not do the only thing
that would actually help him.

11:48.293 --> 11:51.918
Get an octreoscan to confirm
that his liver, pancreas,

11:51.952 --> 11:53.574
and lymph nodes
aren't involved.

11:53.609 --> 11:55.059
On it.

11:56.129 --> 11:58.407
-You should probably go and--
-Referee?

11:58.441 --> 12:00.202
Assist.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.864
The radiolabeled tracer
will light up any areas

12:06.898 --> 12:09.107
infiltrated
by the tumor.

12:09.142 --> 12:11.282
Will I get
spidey strength, too?

12:11.316 --> 12:13.594
Can I get you flat
on your back for the scan?

12:13.629 --> 12:14.941
That won't be too painful,
will it?

12:14.975 --> 12:16.908
No. Sure,
I'll be alright.

12:18.047 --> 12:19.842
Is there any family
you'd like to contact?

12:19.877 --> 12:22.603
No, it's just me.
I live alone.

12:22.638 --> 12:26.193
If you don't mind my asking,
E.V. is genetically inherited.

12:26.228 --> 12:28.851
I'd assume at least one of
your parents suffered from it?

12:28.886 --> 12:30.025
Yeah, they both did.

12:30.059 --> 12:32.924
Did they both also decide
against surgical treatment?

12:32.959 --> 12:35.927
Well, my parents were
circus performers,

12:35.962 --> 12:37.860
made a living
off their appearance,

12:37.895 --> 12:39.897
so I doubt they wanted
any treatment.

12:39.931 --> 12:41.070
Can't say that
for sure, though.

12:41.105 --> 12:44.384
They gave me up,
uh, right after I was born.

12:44.418 --> 12:47.042
I'm sure they were
trying to protect you
from the life they had.

12:47.076 --> 12:49.423
Heh. No,
from what I found out,

12:49.458 --> 12:51.943
they thought a family act
would be too sad

12:51.978 --> 12:54.083
and ruin the gig,
so they didn't want me around.

12:54.635 --> 12:55.878
That's horrible.

12:55.913 --> 12:57.742
Not at all.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.915
I grew up in foster homes.

12:58.950 --> 13:02.057
I had one mom
who was a minister,

13:02.091 --> 13:04.128
introduced me to the power
of the Lord.

13:04.162 --> 13:08.477
And then, when I was older,
I had a dad who was
a carpenter.

13:08.511 --> 13:09.892
Taught me everything I know.

13:09.927 --> 13:11.618
[chuckles softly]

13:11.652 --> 13:13.793
I've always been blessed.

13:18.867 --> 13:22.111
Advancing the catheter
to assess posterior
circulation.

13:25.943 --> 13:27.668
Dr. Murphy,
do you mind if I ask,

13:27.703 --> 13:28.842
qhy are you observing us?

13:29.878 --> 13:31.465
I don't mind.

13:33.122 --> 13:34.641
Why are you observing us?

13:34.675 --> 13:35.918
I am not observing you.

13:35.953 --> 13:38.956
I observing this case
because it is interesting.

13:38.990 --> 13:40.750
Also, because it is
Dr. Glassman's,

13:40.785 --> 13:41.924
and he may display
additional symptoms

13:41.959 --> 13:43.029
that will help me
diagnose

13:43.063 --> 13:45.928
his deteriorating
executive function.

13:45.963 --> 13:47.447
So you're worried
because he forgot

13:47.481 --> 13:49.656
-a couple of stitches
on a routine close?
-Stop.

13:54.695 --> 13:57.629
The third aneurysm is low lying
at the basilar trunk.

13:57.664 --> 14:00.046
That will be very difficult
to clip.

14:00.494 --> 14:02.013
And dangerous.

14:02.048 --> 14:05.292
Definitely a very
interesting case.

14:11.574 --> 14:15.233
♪ Hush, little baby
Don't say a word ♪

14:15.268 --> 14:18.996
♪ Mama's gonna buy you
A mockingbird ♪

14:19.030 --> 14:20.721
You sure you should be
doing that?

14:20.756 --> 14:22.862
Changing bandages
or singing?

14:23.207 --> 14:24.415
Both.

14:28.350 --> 14:30.283
She's gonna be
leaving soon.

14:30.317 --> 14:31.663
I'll be fine.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.122
[Asher] No,
I'm not overreacting.

14:42.157 --> 14:45.746
He is covered
in these tree-like growths
but refuses surgery.

14:45.781 --> 14:48.163
But everyone acts
as if he's so inspiring.

14:48.197 --> 14:49.509
It's a pretty
brave choice.

14:49.543 --> 14:51.097
No, it's a stupid choice.

14:51.131 --> 14:53.754
Living in isolation
and unnecessary pain,

14:53.789 --> 14:55.066
all because of his belief

14:55.101 --> 14:57.551
in the Magical Mystery Tour
that is religion.

14:57.586 --> 14:59.036
Well, given
your family history,

14:59.070 --> 15:01.038
I see why this patient is
a little triggering for you.

15:01.072 --> 15:02.694
Okay, I'm not triggered.

15:02.729 --> 15:05.905
This has nothing
to do with my family.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.873
Religion is the opiate
of the masses.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.082
You know, Marx got a lot wrong,
but not that one.

15:11.117 --> 15:12.566
Why don't we talk about
something else?

15:12.601 --> 15:15.466
I mean, look at terrorism,
the countless wars,

15:15.500 --> 15:18.745
the KKK, al-Qaeda,
bombed abortion clinics,

15:18.779 --> 15:20.712
the assault on women's rights,
not to mention

15:20.747 --> 15:23.992
the rampant persecution
of the LGBTQIA community.

15:24.026 --> 15:25.959
I mean, you either have to have
your head in the sand

15:25.994 --> 15:28.272
or be a complete moron
not to see that.

15:28.755 --> 15:29.756
Mmm.

15:30.895 --> 15:33.242
This is done.
Will you grab the salad?

15:48.188 --> 15:51.260
Sorry. I was looking
for a place to meditate.

15:51.295 --> 15:52.917
It's okay.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.059
I came here to decompress
before I head home.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.583
Jordan.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.621
The other night
at karaoke,

16:07.656 --> 16:10.348
I shouldn't have tried to
give you relationship advice.

16:10.383 --> 16:12.626
I mean, you don't need me
for that...

16:14.525 --> 16:16.285
or anything else, really.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.325
You're everything.

16:26.192 --> 16:27.158
Thanks.

16:28.435 --> 16:29.678
[cellphone chimes]

16:31.369 --> 16:33.095
Sorry, I gotta go.

16:34.510 --> 16:35.822
[machine beeping]

16:35.856 --> 16:37.720
He started vomiting blood
and then lost consciousness.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.274
Get two units PRBC,
stay two ahead,

16:39.308 --> 16:41.034
-and place an NG tube.
-On it.

16:41.069 --> 16:43.726
Eddie, can you hear me?
Eddie?

16:47.868 --> 16:49.318
The tumor's caused
a severe duodenal ulcer

16:49.353 --> 16:51.872
and major hemorrhaging
in his upper GI tract.

16:51.907 --> 16:54.185
Yeah. We can't excise it
if we can't stop the bleed.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.567
We could do it in two steps,
endoscopy to stop the bleed

16:56.601 --> 16:58.879
and a partial duodenectomy
to remove the tumor.

16:58.914 --> 17:01.744
But it'd be safer to debulk
the tumor after the scope

17:01.779 --> 17:03.988
and follow up with
aggressive chemotherapy.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.782
Chemo would increase the pace
of the E.V. growths.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.198
Which he doesn't
seem bothered by.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.647
Doesn't mean we should
make it worse.

17:08.682 --> 17:10.201
Well, it's better than
bleeding out in the OR.

17:10.236 --> 17:12.340
He's not going
to bleed out.

17:12.376 --> 17:14.240
We can solve
both the GI bleed

17:14.273 --> 17:18.070
and totally excise the tumor
with a pancreaticoduodenectomy.

17:18.106 --> 17:20.935
A Whipple while the patient
is hemorrhaging?

17:20.970 --> 17:23.145
That's even more risky
than combining the scope and--

17:23.180 --> 17:26.700
I'm aware of that,
but unlike your
department chief,

17:26.734 --> 17:28.012
I'm not interested
in whether residents

17:28.047 --> 17:29.669
approve of my decisions.

17:29.703 --> 17:31.947
Get him prepped.

17:31.981 --> 17:33.328
[Dr. Glassman] We'll approach
all three aneurysms

17:33.362 --> 17:35.054
from a left-sided craniotomy.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.505
Even though the ICA aneurysm
is on the right side?

17:38.540 --> 17:39.955
Yes.

17:40.956 --> 17:42.785
We'll go after
the basilar first,

17:42.820 --> 17:44.373
as that is
the most challenging.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.548
What about
the ipsilateral PCOM?

17:46.582 --> 17:49.033
It's pressing the third nerve
and may rupture soon.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.897
If you'd let me finish,

17:50.931 --> 17:53.658
step two
will be the PCOM,

17:53.693 --> 17:55.798
and after that,

17:55.833 --> 17:58.215
we'll cut across the infield
and go after the ICA.

17:58.249 --> 17:59.561
Have you considered--

17:59.595 --> 18:01.873
Shaun, will you stop?
Will you just please stop?

18:01.908 --> 18:03.668
I'm fine.
I know what I'm doing.

18:03.703 --> 18:05.222
My memory is intact.

18:05.256 --> 18:08.466
[raises voice] Does anyone
have an actual objection
to the surgical plan?

18:08.915 --> 18:10.123
-No.
-Nope.

18:10.158 --> 18:12.229
Thank you.
It is extensive

18:12.263 --> 18:16.336
and could put Ricky at risk
for future seizures.

18:16.371 --> 18:18.821
And your outburst
could indicate a lack
of impulse control,

18:18.856 --> 18:21.169
which is a symptom
of executive dysfunction.

18:21.203 --> 18:25.000
I am exhibiting extraordinary
impulse control as we speak.

18:25.034 --> 18:28.383
As to the risks,
I have clipped
over 2,000 aneurysms.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.144
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to clip three more.

18:34.423 --> 18:36.563
Put Ricky
on the schedule.

18:36.598 --> 18:38.462
Go home.
Get some sleep.

18:42.293 --> 18:45.227
It's not milk and cookies,
but it'll have to do for now.

18:46.711 --> 18:49.438
Oh, sorry.
I was gonna take care of that.

18:49.473 --> 18:52.131
Why? Did Park tell you to?

18:52.165 --> 18:54.133
Dr. Park? No.
I just got off my break,

18:54.167 --> 18:56.411
-and I was going to--
-Great news.

18:56.445 --> 18:58.999
I just got off the phone
with her social worker.

18:59.034 --> 19:00.656
She found a foster family.

19:00.691 --> 19:02.831
[chuckles]

19:02.865 --> 19:05.454
Lucky girl.
You've got a home.

19:09.596 --> 19:10.701
[gurgles]

19:14.222 --> 19:16.155
I know you were hoping
for a pancake dinner,

19:16.189 --> 19:18.778
but I was thinking
maybe we could go
to Barone's instead.

19:18.812 --> 19:21.367
I'm really craving
a meatball.

19:21.401 --> 19:24.128
Yes, Dr. Glassman is not only
highly experienced.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.613
He has above average
intelligence.

19:26.648 --> 19:28.443
I don't know.
He is an A's fan.

19:29.306 --> 19:31.963
I have not noticed
any symptoms

19:31.998 --> 19:34.207
significant enough
to alert Dr. Lim,

19:34.242 --> 19:36.727
but even with a decline
in executive function,

19:36.761 --> 19:38.970
he might not
show serious deficits.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.489
I think we should definitely
discuss it further,

19:40.524 --> 19:42.319
over sauteed artichokes.

19:42.353 --> 19:44.700
I am not hungry,
but I will come
and keep you company

19:44.735 --> 19:46.392
while I continue
to work.

19:49.326 --> 19:51.811
If Glassy can still
do brain surgery

19:51.845 --> 19:54.400
and you haven't seen
any serious deficits--

19:54.434 --> 19:58.093
There is definitely something
wrong with his brain.

19:58.127 --> 20:00.578
He's getting older.
It happens to everyone.

20:00.613 --> 20:02.787
This is not just aging.

20:02.822 --> 20:04.375
I know Dr. Glassman.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.207
Do you think Glassman
is a danger to his patients?

20:12.418 --> 20:13.902
No.

20:14.592 --> 20:15.593
Not yet.

20:17.285 --> 20:20.943
Then let's go to Barone's
and eat some meatballs

20:20.978 --> 20:24.050
and chicken wings
that I will enjoy for
a few glorious hours

20:24.084 --> 20:26.086
until the indigestion
kicks in.

20:29.952 --> 20:31.195
You are right.

20:32.369 --> 20:33.956
Meatball, stat.

20:40.515 --> 20:43.345
[Dr. Andrews]
That's the last anastomosis.
Remove the clamp.

20:47.107 --> 20:49.109
Looks like the sutures
are holding.

20:49.144 --> 20:51.457
[Asher] I can't believe we did
a Whipple in under six hours.

20:51.491 --> 20:53.113
That's gotta be
a record.

20:53.148 --> 20:56.703
More importantly,
no more tumor,
no more bleeding ulcer.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.187
Went even better
than I'd hoped.

20:58.222 --> 21:00.397
[Jordan] Gotta give
the good Lord his due.

21:01.329 --> 21:02.951
Eddie is truly blessed.

21:04.918 --> 21:07.058
We need a few more
4-0 prolenes on a Castro

21:07.093 --> 21:09.095
and two surgical drains.

21:18.656 --> 21:21.141
Hey. You got your gear
for tonight?

21:21.176 --> 21:22.488
Yep.

21:22.522 --> 21:24.075
Dug out
the old football cleats.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.491
[chuckles] Awesome.

21:25.525 --> 21:27.286
Samira's really looking forward
to meeting you.

21:29.011 --> 21:30.944
Don't worry.
I respect your recovery.

21:30.979 --> 21:32.636
-I'm not trying
to set you up.
-Thank you.

21:33.809 --> 21:35.086
Jordan also told me
she'd kill me

21:35.121 --> 21:36.743
if I did anything
to tempt you off your path.

21:38.952 --> 21:41.438
You and Dr. Allen
were talking about me?

21:41.472 --> 21:43.474
Yeah. She was just
making sure I knew
what you were dealing with.

21:44.855 --> 21:46.477
She's definitely
looking out for you.

21:47.754 --> 21:49.135
[cellphone chimes]

21:54.968 --> 21:58.178
[Ricky grunting
and gasping]

21:58.213 --> 22:00.215
My head.
It's gonna explode.

22:00.249 --> 22:03.632
He has a thunderclap headache
and double vision.

22:03.667 --> 22:06.497
His left eyelid's droopy,
looks like complete
third nerve palsy.

22:06.532 --> 22:07.947
Left pupil non-reactive
to light.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.500
The PCOM aneurysm
must have ruptured.

22:09.535 --> 22:11.882
We need to get him
to the OR, stat.

22:11.916 --> 22:13.228
[Dr. Perez] Page Dr. Glassman.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.130
[Dr. Glassman] Scalpel.

22:29.071 --> 22:31.557
[Dr. Kalu] Intracranial
pressure is dropping.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.006
We've bought him
some temporary relief.

22:33.041 --> 22:36.078
Can we see the CT scans,
the new ones, please?

22:38.529 --> 22:40.220
[Shaun] Given the
subarachnoid hemorrhage,

22:40.255 --> 22:42.740
the risk of the previous
surgical plan has increased.

22:42.775 --> 22:44.673
I can still clip
the two smaller aneurysms,

22:44.708 --> 22:47.331
then ligate and bypass
the ruptured one.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.022
We should consider
coil embolization

22:49.057 --> 22:50.334
of the ruptured aneurysm.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.336
We treat that now
and then come back
for the other two

22:52.371 --> 22:53.820
once Ricky
has recovered.

22:53.855 --> 22:56.478
Then he has to come in
every six months
for an angiogram,

22:56.513 --> 22:59.516
weakening his muscles,
damaging his coordination,

22:59.550 --> 23:01.310
effectively ending
his pro career.

23:01.345 --> 23:02.657
That's your recommendation?

23:04.072 --> 23:07.731
[Kalu] The treatment is
a much safer option.

23:07.765 --> 23:09.111
[Perez] He's 19.

23:09.146 --> 23:11.493
He has lots of life
to consider after baseball.

23:11.528 --> 23:13.322
[Dr. Glassman] I'm confident
in what I promised.

23:13.357 --> 23:15.117
I'm confident
that I can deliver it.

23:15.152 --> 23:18.500
Your experience mitigates
the increased risks

23:18.535 --> 23:20.606
of the craniotomy,
but it does not eliminate them.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.297
The patient should decide.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.059
Fine.

23:26.094 --> 23:28.579
Let's wake him up
and present both plans.

23:32.100 --> 23:35.275
The surgery went better
than we could have hoped.

23:35.310 --> 23:37.208
We removed the tumor,

23:37.243 --> 23:39.866
and your liver and pancreas
are working great.

23:41.281 --> 23:44.112
So when do I
get to go home?

23:44.146 --> 23:46.355
Well, we need to keep an eye
on you for a couple days.

23:46.390 --> 23:48.047
I took the liberty of
getting you a few things

23:48.081 --> 23:49.738
to help pass the time.

23:52.741 --> 23:53.915
Thank you.

23:57.332 --> 24:00.231
I'm so grateful
to you all.

24:00.266 --> 24:02.889
I've spent so much time
on my own, I can forget
how wonderful it is

24:02.924 --> 24:04.615
to have other people there
who care about you.

24:14.798 --> 24:18.387
Hey. Sorry. I got
a little aggro last night.

24:18.422 --> 24:20.182
My family was big
on dinner debate time.

24:20.838 --> 24:21.943
Okay.

24:23.151 --> 24:24.946
That's all you have
to say?

24:24.980 --> 24:27.431
I have a blood draw
to do, so...

24:28.950 --> 24:30.607
It was just
a philosophical discussion.

24:30.641 --> 24:32.816
It's not like we got
into a fight, right?

24:32.850 --> 24:34.645
No, we didn't.

24:40.996 --> 24:43.171
[Lea and Morgan laugh]

24:43.205 --> 24:45.104
-It was awful.
-Terrible.

24:45.138 --> 24:46.830
[humming]

24:46.864 --> 24:48.590
Somebody's
in a good mood.

24:48.625 --> 24:49.867
Indeed I am.

24:49.902 --> 24:51.144
It's the Eddie effect.

24:51.179 --> 24:53.492
Our patient
radiates positivity.

24:53.526 --> 24:54.976
It's oddly contagious.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.219
It's got me wondering
why I'm always so focused

24:57.254 --> 25:00.015
on choosing the right path
instead of...

25:00.050 --> 25:03.018
just being open
to God's gifts.

25:03.053 --> 25:04.503
[burps] Sorry.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.162
My gift is using my stomach
as a speedbag.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.512
[laughs]

25:14.236 --> 25:16.169
I don't know what's worse...

25:16.204 --> 25:17.861
that I might not
walk out of here,

25:17.895 --> 25:20.415
or walking out knowing that
I'll never play ball again.

25:20.449 --> 25:24.902
Yes. That is the question
you need to answer.

25:24.937 --> 25:27.180
Don't get stuck
on worst-case scenarios.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.494
I worked real hard to get here,
you know?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.220
And I... And I got
people counting on me...

25:32.254 --> 25:33.739
Hey, hey, hey.

25:33.773 --> 25:36.017
Shut out the noise.

25:36.051 --> 25:37.363
Other people are gonna
have opinions,

25:37.397 --> 25:38.847
whether you swing 3-0,

25:38.882 --> 25:41.022
whether you don't take
the extra base.

25:41.056 --> 25:43.265
Whatever decision
you make,

25:43.300 --> 25:45.233
that's gonna be
the right decision.

25:53.621 --> 25:57.176
You know, uh, there's a...
There's a saying

25:57.866 --> 25:59.661
back in the DR...

26:00.869 --> 26:02.871
"You can't walk off
the island."

26:07.151 --> 26:08.567
You gotta take big swings.

26:13.468 --> 26:15.263
Let's fix
all the aneurysms now.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.438
Good call.

26:28.138 --> 26:30.692
You'll need to keep
the wound site clean and dry.

26:30.727 --> 26:33.074
And be sure to monitor
her caloric intake closely.

26:33.108 --> 26:35.214
Babies with Turner Syndrome
have difficulty swallowing

26:35.248 --> 26:36.871
and tongue dysfunction.

26:36.905 --> 26:38.079
Turner Syndrome?

26:38.113 --> 26:39.874
Will she need
additional surgeries?

26:39.908 --> 26:42.842
Yes, but
not for a few years.

26:42.877 --> 26:46.639
With things like this,
it's best to take it
one step at a time.

26:46.674 --> 26:49.711
We were hoping
to foster to adopt.

26:49.746 --> 26:52.921
And these long-term
medical issues...

26:52.956 --> 26:54.474
they're significant.

26:54.509 --> 26:57.167
When it comes to medicine,
Google is not your friend.

26:58.513 --> 27:02.897
Patrick, Annie,
I know it all sounds scary,

27:02.931 --> 27:05.762
and you have every right
to be nervous.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.247
But you can do this.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.181
Eden needs you.

27:24.297 --> 27:26.092
Wouldn't it be best
for Eden

27:26.127 --> 27:28.474
if you found someone
more qualified?

27:32.512 --> 27:34.376
I'll let
Social Services know.

27:48.218 --> 27:51.808
What's the score?

27:51.842 --> 27:54.431
How am I doing?
My executive function.

27:54.465 --> 27:55.984
What's the score?

27:56.019 --> 27:58.400
It is not a score,
it is data,

27:58.435 --> 28:00.782
and I am not ready
to draw my conclusions.

28:00.817 --> 28:02.163
Well, you're
wasting your time.

28:02.197 --> 28:04.855
You should focus on people
who actually need you.

28:04.890 --> 28:07.168
I'm fine.

28:07.202 --> 28:11.137
[Shaun] I am focused on you...

28:11.172 --> 28:14.416
because for most of my life,
you've watched out for me.

28:16.522 --> 28:18.697
No one asked you
to do it.

28:19.249 --> 28:20.388
You chose to.

28:24.357 --> 28:26.566
Sometimes when I didn't
want you to.

28:28.948 --> 28:30.363
I'm very glad you did.

28:33.194 --> 28:36.991
So no matter what anyone,
including you, says,

28:37.025 --> 28:39.407
I am going to
watch out for you.

28:46.863 --> 28:48.830
What are you talking about?
It's fantastic.

28:48.865 --> 28:50.694
-These are incredible,
seriously.
-[chuckles]

28:52.800 --> 28:54.077
I didn't mean to interrupt.

28:54.111 --> 28:57.080
No, Dalisay was just showing me
her watercolor landscapes.

28:57.114 --> 28:58.909
She's a wonderful painter.

28:58.944 --> 29:00.842
[Dr. Andrews]
Really? I had no idea.

29:00.877 --> 29:04.121
There's increased output
in his J.P. drains.

29:04.156 --> 29:06.020
That's not surprising,
considering your EV.

29:07.435 --> 29:08.885
Send a sample to the lab
and add meropenem

29:08.919 --> 29:10.749
to his antibiotic regimen,
just to be safe.

29:13.613 --> 29:15.892
Your recovery
looks to be on track.

29:15.926 --> 29:17.617
And we've made
significant advances

29:17.652 --> 29:20.137
in plastic surgery techniques
since your last consult.

29:20.172 --> 29:22.070
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

29:22.105 --> 29:23.727
But we both know
it would still be painful,

29:23.762 --> 29:26.937
and they'd just
grow back anyway.

29:26.972 --> 29:30.492
There's one thing I've learned
from the home reno business,

29:30.527 --> 29:32.598
"If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."

29:35.325 --> 29:36.947
A proverb for the ages.

29:45.991 --> 29:47.061
I wanted to say goodbye.

29:47.095 --> 29:48.959
The foster parents
backed out.

29:48.994 --> 29:51.099
She's scrambling
to find someone else.

29:58.279 --> 29:59.936
I don't have another family
lined up.

30:02.145 --> 30:03.491
Can you give me
more time?

30:05.873 --> 30:06.977
N-No.

30:08.530 --> 30:11.706
Eden needs a home,
and I know the perfect person
to foster her.

30:13.328 --> 30:14.433
Me.

30:29.724 --> 30:31.312
[Dr. Glassman]
One down, two to go.

30:34.004 --> 30:36.662
[Shaun] It's been five hours.
Do you need a break?

30:36.696 --> 30:38.491
Not when I have
a 30-year-old Macallan

30:38.526 --> 30:41.425
waiting for me
at the finish line.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.048
Fenestrated aneurysm clip.

30:43.082 --> 30:45.015
[monitor alarm sounds]

30:45.050 --> 30:46.223
[Perez] We've got
an intra-op rupture.

30:46.258 --> 30:47.397
[Kalu] Bleed is massive.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.985
Suction.
Both of you, suction.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.503
Let's keep this field clear.

30:50.538 --> 30:51.780
Should we try
balloon occlusion?

30:51.815 --> 30:53.299
-Or a flow diverting stent?
-[Shaun] No.

30:53.334 --> 30:54.645
We should adjust the clips

30:54.680 --> 30:56.371
to get better proximal
and distal control

30:56.406 --> 30:59.547
[fading] and pivot
to a Muslin wrapping.

30:59.581 --> 31:02.308
[Dr. Glassman]
Push 6 mg bolus adenosine.

31:04.724 --> 31:06.381
We're gonna stop the heart.

31:06.416 --> 31:08.004
Push it, please.
Push it.

31:11.076 --> 31:13.699
-[machine flatlines]
-Aneurysm clips.

31:15.080 --> 31:18.635
Oh. That is very innovative.

31:18.669 --> 31:19.981
Inducing a brief
cardiac arrest

31:20.016 --> 31:22.604
reduces blood flow
to the aneurysm.

31:22.639 --> 31:25.055
Gives us time
to apply the clips.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.851
[flatline continues]

31:30.578 --> 31:34.893
[alarm stops
and beeping resumes]

31:34.927 --> 31:39.173
Okay. Let us proceed
with the parent vessel
reconstruction.

31:39.207 --> 31:42.762
One more time,
fenestrated aneurysm clip.

31:42.797 --> 31:44.040
Thank you.

31:45.455 --> 31:47.112
That was exciting.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.120
-[monitor alarm sounds]
-[Asher] He's in Vfib,

31:55.154 --> 31:56.949
not responding to chest
compressions or epi--

31:56.984 --> 31:58.364
We need to shock him.
Charge to 200,

31:58.399 --> 31:59.779
and push another
milligram of epi.

31:59.814 --> 32:00.919
[Asher] He must have
thrown a clot.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.127
[Nurse Villanueva] Clear!

32:02.161 --> 32:04.267
[paddles thumping]

32:30.741 --> 32:33.503
Time of death, 7:34.

32:37.300 --> 32:40.889
His underlying illness
weakened his immune system

32:40.924 --> 32:44.065
and made his blood
more susceptible to clots.

32:44.928 --> 32:46.481
There's nothing
we could have done.

32:56.802 --> 32:58.597
Do you know
what hospital you're in?

32:58.631 --> 32:59.978
St. Bonaventure.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.462
And why are you here?

33:01.496 --> 33:05.086
Aneurysms, which you were
supposed to fix.

33:05.121 --> 33:07.916
Which we did.
And we did quite well.

33:07.951 --> 33:09.953
In fact, if you stick
to your rehab,

33:09.988 --> 33:12.507
you might be back
on the field by mid-season.

33:12.542 --> 33:15.027
[sighs]

33:15.062 --> 33:16.787
Thank you, Dr. Glassman.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.345
You got a surgery that can
help me hit a curveball?

33:22.379 --> 33:24.657
[chuckles]
Try hitting a knuckleball.

33:24.692 --> 33:27.833
You don't know what it is
until, pfft, it's too late.

33:27.867 --> 33:29.179
[Ricky] That's old school.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.354
I haven't even seen one
in a game.

33:31.388 --> 33:33.149
Oh, I used to throw
a knuckleball, actually,

33:33.183 --> 33:34.667
back in the day.

33:34.702 --> 33:36.669
[fading]
I tried to be a pitcher.

33:36.704 --> 33:38.809
But I didn't have
a fastball...

33:46.541 --> 33:48.647
[normal voice] And then
you have no idea
where it's gonna go

33:48.681 --> 33:50.200
'cause it had just a...

33:52.616 --> 33:54.170
Just a slight
amount of spin.

33:58.588 --> 34:00.486
[sighs] You heard?

34:03.351 --> 34:05.250
Thank you
for checking on me.

34:06.458 --> 34:07.666
Andrews was right.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.219
There's nothing more
we could have done.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.396
I'm really sorry
about your patient,

34:13.429 --> 34:15.536
but I actually
came to tell you

34:15.570 --> 34:18.746
that I'm meeting up
with some friends tonight.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.920
I'm gonna go back
to my place after.

34:22.507 --> 34:24.062
Okay.

34:26.029 --> 34:28.065
But what's wrong?

34:28.100 --> 34:30.033
Nothing. [sighs]

34:30.068 --> 34:34.072
I've been meaning to see
these folks for a while, and...

34:34.106 --> 34:36.074
we're meeting near my place.
No big deal.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.248
Well, it's starting
to feel like one.

34:39.732 --> 34:42.114
Clearly, you're mad.
Please tell me what I did.

34:45.152 --> 34:48.706
Sometimes having
a conversation with you

34:48.741 --> 34:50.639
feels like combat.

34:50.674 --> 34:52.745
[scoffs] Well, I was just
stating my opinion.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.059
No, you were obliterating all
other opinions, including mine.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.819
And calling me a complete
moron in the process.

34:57.854 --> 34:59.407
I have never said
that you were a moron.

34:59.442 --> 35:01.927
-I said...
-Ash, I didn't grow up
discussing religion

35:01.961 --> 35:03.618
or quoting Marx
at the dinner table.

35:03.653 --> 35:05.379
That doesn't mean
I don't value your opinion.

35:05.413 --> 35:07.381
It doesn't seem like it
when you take a sledgehammer

35:07.415 --> 35:08.451
to my every argument.

35:08.485 --> 35:10.211
I can give you 100 examples
of times when--

35:10.246 --> 35:12.248
This is not another argument
for you to win.

35:16.804 --> 35:18.150
I have to get to dinner.

35:32.268 --> 35:34.097
I'm so sorry.

35:35.616 --> 35:38.239
If you want some company
or someone to talk to...

35:40.034 --> 35:42.140
It's alright.
I'll be okay.

35:42.864 --> 35:44.072
I know.

35:44.107 --> 35:45.936
But...

35:45.971 --> 35:49.147
if you change your mind,
I've got your back.

35:49.181 --> 35:50.355
Like you've had mine.

35:51.356 --> 35:52.805
Thank you.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.362
You...

36:00.019 --> 36:01.366
really see me.

36:03.885 --> 36:08.718
I think maybe you and I
could be gifts to each other.

36:11.652 --> 36:13.895
And we should
be open to that.

36:17.830 --> 36:20.833
I have no idea
what it looks like
for us to move forward.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.631
We'll figure it out.

36:43.925 --> 36:45.893
[Dr. Andrews] Dalisay.

36:45.927 --> 36:47.584
Dr. Andrews.

36:47.619 --> 36:51.001
Your landscapes
you showed Eddie
before he...

36:53.970 --> 36:57.491
I think you shared them
with him because he was
so open-hearted.

37:00.563 --> 37:04.187
See, my whole life,
I've believed

37:04.222 --> 37:09.088
that success only came
from constant striving,

37:09.123 --> 37:12.160
constant dissatisfaction
with where I was

37:12.195 --> 37:14.024
or what
I'd accomplished.

37:14.059 --> 37:17.373
Contentment was a sign
of complacency.

37:17.407 --> 37:19.444
That's no way
to go through life.

37:19.478 --> 37:21.446
I know.

37:21.480 --> 37:26.520
And I know I didn't
show you enough respect,

37:26.554 --> 37:28.453
and I didn't make
enough effort

37:28.487 --> 37:32.042
to see things
from your point of view.

37:33.112 --> 37:36.219
But I want to change.

37:36.254 --> 37:40.085
I want to value
the people I care about

37:40.119 --> 37:41.880
and who might
care about me.

37:46.850 --> 37:50.578
And if I haven't screwed up
too badly, then maybe one day,

37:50.613 --> 37:55.411
I'll be worthy enough
to see those landscapes.

38:00.933 --> 38:02.141
How about dinner?

38:02.176 --> 38:04.316
You pick me up at 7:30,
Saturday.

38:04.351 --> 38:06.491
We can try
that Filipino place.

38:11.979 --> 38:14.809
-[all laughing]
-Why would you say that?

38:14.844 --> 38:16.259
-You know--
-Oh, man.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.399
Hey, what else do you say
in that situation?

38:18.434 --> 38:20.228
I think
I agree with the guy.

38:20.263 --> 38:22.196
I mean, I think he's--
I think...

38:24.509 --> 38:25.924
You were right.

38:25.958 --> 38:29.962
I have a tendency to go
scorched earth in a debate

38:29.997 --> 38:31.688
because I just want
to win.

38:31.723 --> 38:35.347
I lose sight of
what's important
because I'm...

38:35.382 --> 38:37.004
I-I'm a moron.

38:37.038 --> 38:38.488
But today, I realized

38:38.523 --> 38:42.458
I shouldn't take anything
or anyone for granted.

38:45.633 --> 38:50.224
You showed me
what it truly means
to belong,

38:51.329 --> 38:53.123
to not be an island.

38:55.712 --> 38:59.440
And I just feel so blessed
to be in your life.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.447
Uh, and you should order
the salmon carpaccio.

39:06.482 --> 39:09.070
It's delightful here.
It's like butter.

39:13.903 --> 39:15.353
Is your boyfriend
really that passionate,

39:15.387 --> 39:17.009
or is he
a little insane?

39:19.426 --> 39:20.806
Both.

39:20.841 --> 39:22.187
[laughs]

39:22.221 --> 39:23.361
[sighs]

39:23.395 --> 39:24.465
[doorbell rings]

39:26.985 --> 39:28.883
Hi.

39:28.918 --> 39:32.162
I thought I'd stop by,
see how you and Eden
are settling in.

39:32.197 --> 39:33.612
We're fine, so far.

39:33.647 --> 39:34.924
I think.

39:36.270 --> 39:38.755
I'm fairly sure I have
everything Eden needs,

39:38.790 --> 39:40.999
though peds might find
a few things missing

39:41.033 --> 39:43.484
from their inventory
this month.

39:43.519 --> 39:45.762
I don't see
one of these.

39:47.454 --> 39:48.869
Oh.

39:48.903 --> 39:50.526
Oh, Eden will love it.

39:51.596 --> 39:52.700
Thank you.

39:56.670 --> 39:58.326
Toys.

39:58.361 --> 40:00.501
Onesies.
I need to get a stroller--

40:00.536 --> 40:02.434
Hey, you'll handle it.

40:02.469 --> 40:05.403
It's the perfect practice run
for when your own comes along.

40:07.991 --> 40:10.235
I'm going off
my IVF meds.

40:10.269 --> 40:11.857
I'm not doing
another cycle.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.171
Eden,

40:15.205 --> 40:19.037
she's what
I've been waiting for.

40:19.071 --> 40:20.832
She's my daughter.

40:40.921 --> 40:43.820
I thought it was Dr. Glassman's
cancer returning,

40:43.855 --> 40:45.788
but it is damage
to Dr. Glassman's brain

40:45.822 --> 40:47.928
as a result
of a mini-stroke.

40:54.659 --> 40:56.799
If that were the case,
the area would have
smooth edges.

40:56.833 --> 40:58.939
Mmm, usually, yes.
But rare presentations

40:58.973 --> 41:01.079
can show abnormalities
like these rough edges,

41:01.113 --> 41:04.496
particularly when the patient
has had radiation treatment.

41:06.602 --> 41:09.467
It explains why his memory
has been impacted,

41:09.501 --> 41:11.158
especially during periods
of intense focus

41:11.192 --> 41:13.850
