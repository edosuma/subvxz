01:52.416 --> 01:54.316
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:20.122 --> 02:22.172
- Good morning.
- Mr Stjaernblom.

02:24.557 --> 02:25.921
Got your bathing costume?

02:26.872 --> 02:28.416
- Bathing costume?
- Yes.

02:30.205 --> 02:31.425
Bathing costume?

02:32.013 --> 02:33.159
Bathing costume?

03:13.747 --> 03:15.895
Father... time to get up!

03:19.899 --> 03:20.863
G'day!

03:21.543 --> 03:22.504
G'day!

03:28.163 --> 03:29.350
Hi there!

03:32.979 --> 03:35.699
Lydia, Lydia, Lydia.
As beautiful as ever.

03:38.679 --> 03:41.171
This is Anders Stille's daughter Lydia.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.158
Stjaernblom, the new proof-reader
at the 'National News'.

03:48.372 --> 03:49.462
It's still...

03:50.314 --> 03:52.775
I mean, if you compare it with...

03:54.122 --> 03:55.294
This one.

03:56.130 --> 03:57.497
But that's good isn't it?

03:59.050 --> 04:01.365
I didn't realise it was morning.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.598
- Anders...

04:04.458 --> 04:05.502
Anders!

04:06.002 --> 04:07.091
My brother!

04:08.145 --> 04:09.458
Welcome!

04:11.469 --> 04:12.977
Skoal!

04:15.996 --> 04:17.425
Let's get stuck into it!

04:18.264 --> 04:19.353
A tasty-looking repast!

04:19.474 --> 04:20.406
Thanks.

04:24.459 --> 04:27.304
It's still cooking... it's perfect.

04:27.484 --> 04:28.383
Mr Stjaernblom.

04:28.430 --> 04:29.591
Beautifully done.

04:31.442 --> 04:32.596
I can take one more.

04:33.870 --> 04:34.924
A small potato.

04:35.410 --> 04:37.185
Lydia, do we have serviettes?

04:37.349 --> 04:40.146
- We can have another one, eh?
- Of course we can!

04:42.163 --> 04:44.134
Yes, so... Bon appetit!

04:45.112 --> 04:47.229
We've barely started...

04:53.788 --> 04:55.342
You not having a drink, Lydia?

04:55.874 --> 04:56.741
Lydia?

05:01.795 --> 05:03.727
A toast to love and art.

05:04.252 --> 05:07.274
We raise our glasses to toast...

05:07.736 --> 05:08.732
Stille's...

05:09.475 --> 05:11.338
...splendid paintings.

05:11.955 --> 05:13.207
For the...

05:13.652 --> 05:14.868
rain that...

05:15.306 --> 05:17.009
glistens on the tree-trunks.

05:19.302 --> 05:20.712
Something has happened...

05:21.273 --> 05:22.952
...a moment is captured.

05:38.411 --> 05:40.154
Once, back in the eighties...

05:40.638 --> 05:43.148
I painted a neat little canvas...

05:45.497 --> 05:49.700
...that I called
"Outhouse in stormy weather".

06:02.451 --> 06:04.068
Is that your father's?

06:05.705 --> 06:06.530
That?

06:07.686 --> 06:09.108
No, that's mine.

06:14.372 --> 06:15.439
Here...

06:32.997 --> 06:34.617
I've nothing on the walls at home....

06:34.961 --> 06:36.125
except for a map.

06:37.622 --> 06:38.843
A map of the world?

06:38.907 --> 06:39.712
No.

06:40.360 --> 06:41.742
Just Vaermland.

06:55.175 --> 06:57.332
I'd really like to travel...

07:00.283 --> 07:01.539
See the world.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.133
I'm going to keep you here.

08:07.663 --> 08:09.157
- You alright?
- Yes, thanks.

08:11.597 --> 08:12.641
AdjÃ¶.

08:14.199 --> 08:16.939
I promise we'll write well
about your work!

08:17.086 --> 08:19.430
I'll hit upon the right description.

08:20.663 --> 08:21.978
I thank you in advance!

08:22.277 --> 08:24.019
We'll certainly see to it.

08:26.122 --> 08:27.599
Goodbye!

08:37.080 --> 08:38.706
That Stjaernblom fellow...

08:39.491 --> 08:40.941
Arvid's his name.

08:43.038 --> 08:46.044
Did you notice how hungry he was ?

08:50.238 --> 08:52.371
Is that the sort of man you want?

08:53.214 --> 08:54.326
A Vaermlander?

08:55.745 --> 08:58.021
Your children would be going hungry.

08:58.698 --> 09:01.099
His type tend to be troubled.

09:01.259 --> 09:05.456
There's always insecurity
with those who have been poor.

09:05.622 --> 09:07.177
Markel left the punch out.

09:08.326 --> 09:09.154
Where?

09:09.740 --> 09:11.224
It's on the table.

09:20.669 --> 09:22.964
Out - I want to get out

10:01.747 --> 10:05.546
Hell and damnation!
What are the advertisers going to think?

10:07.350 --> 10:09.574
How can we have editorial
which maintains...

10:10.340 --> 10:13.690
...that the telephone is a passing fad
that will soon disappear.

10:15.161 --> 10:19.327
Maybe I exaggerated a little,
but I give it 10 years at the most

10:19.741 --> 10:21.998
The voice gets quite distorted in it.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.439
That'll improve.

10:23.795 --> 10:27.034
Write something about Queen Sofia.
She has a new dog.

10:27.261 --> 10:28.613
We go to press in an hour!

10:30.861 --> 10:31.959
Stjaernblom!

10:40.872 --> 10:44.228
Lovein will not review "Faust".

10:44.369 --> 10:47.040
He won't write his article at night.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.431
That would be devastating for him,
not for the composer.

10:51.455 --> 10:52.673
This is an opera?

10:54.040 --> 10:55.884
Yes. It's "Faust"!

10:57.455 --> 10:58.717
Could you do it, Stjaernblom?

10:59.295 --> 11:01.233
I don't know much about opera.

11:01.422 --> 11:04.571
No, but you can spell,
and you can play the piano.

11:06.613 --> 11:08.082
Just don't be pretentious s.

11:08.247 --> 11:10.699
And whatever you do,
don't imitate Lovein

11:10.793 --> 11:11.981
or there'll be hell to pay.

11:15.690 --> 11:16.637
Thank you.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.406
You'll get to see a bit of Germany.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.151
Of Germany?

11:23.622 --> 11:25.036
Yes, on the stage...

11:26.497 --> 11:27.467
in "Faust".

11:29.705 --> 11:30.964
God almighty...!

13:12.663 --> 13:13.695
Good evening.

13:15.023 --> 13:16.101
Good evening.

13:17.207 --> 13:18.272
Are you alone?

13:19.295 --> 13:21.974
I'm writing a review...
for the 'National News'.

13:24.702 --> 13:26.038
I hope I manage to do it.

13:26.955 --> 13:28.465
I thought you were
a proof-reader.

13:28.996 --> 13:30.653
This is probably a
one-off occurrence.

13:35.955 --> 13:37.293
My father will be coming down.

13:40.212 --> 13:41.956
I've been thinking about you.

13:44.253 --> 13:46.168
I've been thinking
about you, too.

13:47.455 --> 13:48.656
Lydia!

13:50.955 --> 13:51.870
Father.

14:07.788 --> 14:10.535
"The strings...  Miss Klarholm"...
bla bla bla...

14:11.332 --> 14:13.773
Here it is!
Listen everybody!

14:14.021 --> 14:17.538
"At first in the prison scene
Margareta is insane"

14:17.774 --> 14:21.538
 "but Miss Klarholm
plays insane from the beginning."

14:21.705 --> 14:24.067
"She seems to have been
crazy since birth."

14:24.177 --> 14:26.927
Damn! That's good
stuff, Stjaernblom.

14:28.330 --> 14:29.825
Bloody good!

14:37.413 --> 14:38.767
New passengers?

14:57.038 --> 14:58.373
Father!

15:07.163 --> 15:08.568
Hello, Arvid.

15:09.747 --> 15:10.802
Hello.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.440
- How long are you staying?
- I'm leaving tomorrow.

15:32.372 --> 15:33.503
Can I have something to eat?

15:33.686 --> 15:34.659
Whatever you like.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.851
There are potatoes, too.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.888
Are you eating properly
in Stockholm?

15:41.411 --> 15:43.076
Yes, my boarding house
is pretty good.

15:43.836 --> 15:45.156
But everything's quite expensive.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.080
I've been to the opera.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.980
I was there as a sort of journalist.

15:57.642 --> 15:59.580
I wrote a review.

16:01.247 --> 16:02.852
I can read it to you if you like.

16:05.363 --> 16:06.475
I can.

16:06.662 --> 16:10.042
You were pretty clever in school.
You were going to be a teacher.

16:30.705 --> 16:33.458
Have you any use for this in Stockholm?

16:34.102 --> 16:36.540
I bought it for your mother's funeral.

16:38.413 --> 16:41.830
I don't know why I bought it.
It was quite dear.

16:55.788 --> 16:57.280
Looks great.

16:57.678 --> 16:58.468
Yes.

17:01.022 --> 17:02.044
Thanks.

17:12.641 --> 17:14.869
Stjaernblom,
look at this proof.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.902
There. I've written an obituary for Stille.

17:21.824 --> 17:22.911
Anders Stille?

17:23.778 --> 17:25.239
Yes... he's dead.

17:26.728 --> 17:28.382
I didn't know he was sick.

17:28.874 --> 17:30.772
No, it was an accident.

17:31.585 --> 17:33.887
He went out painting at night.

17:34.902 --> 17:36.361
He'd been drinking,
here was frost...

17:36.533 --> 17:37.739
And his daughter?

17:41.395 --> 17:43.243
She was the one
 who found him.

18:52.982 --> 18:53.951
Good day.

18:54.626 --> 18:56.076
How can I help you?

18:56.831 --> 19:00.105
I want to put an advertisement in
for housework.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.066
Miss Stille?

19:08.038 --> 19:09.653
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:11.477 --> 19:14.742
I want to put an advertisement in
about housework.

19:17.622 --> 19:20.996
The editor's out.
We can use the office.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.419
My condolences.

19:43.438 --> 19:44.451
Thank you.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.965
So, are you looking
for household help?

19:48.418 --> 19:49.673
Oh no...

19:50.111 --> 19:52.924
I'm looking for a position for myself.

19:54.372 --> 19:55.705
Housework?

19:57.291 --> 19:58.376
Nothing else?

19:58.899 --> 20:00.672
I can't do anything else.

20:03.997 --> 20:05.569
Can I take your coat?

21:11.955 --> 21:13.650
I can't stop thinking about you.

21:14.587 --> 21:16.314
I think about you at night.

21:18.747 --> 21:21.496
I'm so scared I'll forget
what you look like.

21:25.705 --> 21:26.950
But I can't get married.

21:29.520 --> 21:30.526
Not now.

21:50.205 --> 21:51.454
I have nothing.

21:55.663 --> 21:56.959
Nothing.

22:04.872 --> 22:06.055
Do you understand?

22:07.656 --> 22:08.534
Yes...

22:09.644 --> 22:10.629
No.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.761
Can we see each other in secret?

22:27.955 --> 22:29.164
I have to go.

23:34.476 --> 23:38.038
Lamb steak at Rydberg's. My shout.
Red wine sauce, Stjaernblom.

23:38.205 --> 23:40.327
Gustav Adolf's Square
is closed off.

23:41.023 --> 23:42.099
The demonstrators?

23:42.191 --> 23:43.356
Are we writing about that?

23:43.658 --> 23:45.681
Yes, I'm not writing about lamb steak.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.903
Shall I make some sandwiches instead?

23:49.012 --> 23:51.004
No, thanks, I don't like home-made.

23:52.413 --> 23:54.121
Come on Stjaernblom!

23:56.824 --> 23:57.942
Now they're coming.

23:58.955 --> 24:00.672
Where's this country headed?

24:01.348 --> 24:02.866
Socialists och communists.

24:05.245 --> 24:06.958
I think it's good.

24:07.122 --> 24:07.881
Good?

24:08.717 --> 24:10.114
Don't you see how it looks?

24:10.658 --> 24:13.877
Roslin! Are you one
of the demonstrators?

24:14.497 --> 24:18.376
I'm going to a Nobel committee meeting.
That indispensable Norwegian.

24:18.609 --> 24:22.101
It's only right that ordinary people
should get to vote.

24:22.689 --> 24:24.566
The question is if women
are ordinary people.

24:25.303 --> 24:27.618
Lovein. Art, music.

24:28.056 --> 24:29.085
Science.

24:29.788 --> 24:31.858
Markel, I am newly engaged
to be married.

24:31.883 --> 24:33.911
Congratulations!

24:34.330 --> 24:38.289
I don't believe my future wife
knows what she should vote for.

24:41.264 --> 24:44.198
Gentlemen, my future wife...

24:44.972 --> 24:46.893
Lydia, do you know Markel, the editor?

24:47.872 --> 24:49.833
Yes... we have met.

24:50.169 --> 24:51.736
- This is Lovein.
- Miss Stille.

24:55.330 --> 24:56.431
And...?

24:57.853 --> 24:59.197
Stjaernblom.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.036
Lydia Stille.

25:06.955 --> 25:08.381
Come, my pet.

25:22.663 --> 25:24.835
He's good for at least 600,000.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.327
I believed she thought I was too old.

25:35.705 --> 25:38.187
I thought that she hoped
to find someone younger.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.769
And Roslin...!

25:41.906 --> 25:43.266
He's well over 50.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.175
So age was obviously
not the decider.

25:48.925 --> 25:50.190
She didn't have a choice.

25:50.346 --> 25:52.886
Stille's paintings
wouldn't have brought much.

25:53.269 --> 25:54.796
It really wasn't great art.

25:56.871 --> 25:57.951
Yes...

25:59.249 --> 26:01.260
But a person always has a choice.

26:06.252 --> 26:07.541
Fucking hell!

26:14.873 --> 26:18.365
Autumn comes early

27:05.090 --> 27:06.973
Offer him a glass of champagne.

27:07.983 --> 27:09.350
Go on, do it!

27:19.955 --> 27:21.685
I'm sorry... my parents insisted I come.

27:21.911 --> 27:24.493
You looked as if you were
in need of a little champagne.

27:25.865 --> 27:27.233
We're just over there.

27:30.835 --> 27:31.999
Father calls himself director,

27:32.179 --> 27:34.624
and mother goes on as if
she's in a play by Strindberg.

27:35.413 --> 27:36.360
Thank you.

27:37.016 --> 27:38.235
Don't mention it.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.677
Isn't it miserable to see Paris
on the stage and not in reality.

27:42.966 --> 27:45.263
Or what do you think
of the performance?

27:47.205 --> 27:50.893
Well... I can't actually talk about that.

27:52.663 --> 27:53.807
You see, I'm reviewing it...

27:55.205 --> 27:56.729
for the 'National News'.

27:58.483 --> 27:59.971
You don't say!

28:00.409 --> 28:01.823
Is that true?

28:03.289 --> 28:05.581
- Director Randel.
- Arvid Stjaernblom.

28:06.503 --> 28:08.674
- Mrs Randel.
- Arvid Stjaernblom.

28:09.038 --> 28:11.947
- Dagmar... Randel.
- Arvid Stjaernblom.

28:14.580 --> 28:18.115
The second act may be starting
so we'll take our seats.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.174
You can come later.

28:27.703 --> 28:29.695
Good evening.

29:02.413 --> 29:04.202
The salmon will be excellent.

29:06.372 --> 29:07.969
And you can call me Monica.

29:08.735 --> 29:09.498
Arvid.

29:09.538 --> 29:10.310
Leif.

29:11.088 --> 29:14.745
"That's life!"...
As the English say!

29:16.747 --> 29:19.271
Mother, please stop being silly.

29:22.330 --> 29:23.929
Let me propose a toast.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.403
Arvid...  Dagmar.

29:33.354 --> 29:36.479
Yes this is a genuine Anders Stille.

29:36.854 --> 29:38.653
I believe it's of his wife.

29:38.825 --> 29:41.084
Father, thanks for the picture.
People are staring.

29:42.663 --> 29:45.508
- They aren't always like this.
- Oh, yes we are!

29:46.205 --> 29:48.788
I got this cheap at an auction.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.405
I don't think it is
his wife, though.

29:52.147 --> 29:53.261
Oh, please, Father!

29:53.362 --> 29:56.438
Dagmar, this is
just an investment.

29:57.580 --> 30:00.269
Don't talk about money
in front of the children...

30:00.710 --> 30:02.624
We've had enough embarrassment
already, with the painting.

30:04.122 --> 30:05.849
Stjaernblom is an intellectual, of course.

30:06.841 --> 30:09.025
Nudity is is a somewhat
of a fashion nowadays.

30:09.372 --> 30:13.144
Dagmar threatens to report us
to the police, if we hang it at home.

30:14.330 --> 30:16.561
I really don't care one way
or the other, Mother.

30:17.955 --> 30:21.167
There's something special about Stille.
He's underrated.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.163
There, you see, Monica!

30:24.226 --> 30:27.982
Do you think a percentage value
can be put on that?

30:29.955 --> 30:33.413
You mean how underrated is he,
percentage-wise?

30:33.800 --> 30:34.683
Exactly.

30:40.747 --> 30:42.091
One don't put a price
on one's destiny,

30:42.721 --> 30:43.672
or wife,

30:44.018 --> 30:45.201
or mistress...

30:46.569 --> 30:47.629
...or children.

30:49.122 --> 30:50.405
You get them.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.773
You have them.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.751
And maybe you lose them.

30:57.997 --> 30:59.518
But you don't appraise them.

31:02.872 --> 31:04.332
Congratulations.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.104
Thanks.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.947
Miss Randel is well fixed.

31:10.122 --> 31:12.016
Her father said that he'd help us.

31:13.047 --> 31:15.231
Yes, he's had some luck
with his property deals.

31:15.923 --> 31:19.197
So let's hope the daughter
hasn't inherited father's intelligence.

31:20.056 --> 31:22.589
Or the mother's looks,
for that matter.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.745
Yes, I'm envious of you, Arvid.

31:28.604 --> 31:30.243
You've found love!

32:23.455 --> 32:24.366
Tea?

32:25.747 --> 32:26.673
Thanks.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.822
have you seen my ring?

33:21.134 --> 33:22.602
Your wedding ring?

33:23.497 --> 33:25.443
- Isn't it in the bathroom?
- No.

33:35.223 --> 33:36.530
We'll be tops, I think.

33:37.222 --> 33:39.357
What shall I do
if I'm asked to sing?

33:39.413 --> 33:40.398
You'll sing.

33:42.372 --> 33:44.210
Wait, I have to fix it...

33:45.399 --> 33:47.421
It's a shame you can't come.

33:47.657 --> 33:49.953
Mother has got a small orchestra.

33:50.455 --> 33:52.569
It has to be 'Carmen'
for me instead.

33:53.663 --> 33:57.963
They'll play "The Trout Quintet",
so mother can serve trout as an entree.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.562
Stop!

34:03.497 --> 34:04.760
Good night.

34:07.705 --> 34:09.045
Good night.

34:10.496 --> 34:11.473
Good night.

34:12.587 --> 34:14.860
Felicia, leave the nursery door open.

34:24.126 --> 34:27.032
- You can wake me if you like.
- Give everyone my regards.

36:19.705 --> 36:21.547
Are you happy?

36:24.497 --> 36:26.266
Are you happy?

37:26.038 --> 37:28.633
I've been here a few days,
shopping for Christmas presents.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.695
My husband goes back to Solvik,
first thing tomorrow.

37:38.286 --> 37:40.224
But I'll be here till Monday.

37:42.302 --> 37:43.800
At the Hotel Continental.

37:50.038 --> 37:53.206
I'll be having tea
in the dining room at 2.30.

37:58.637 --> 37:59.709
I'm married.

38:01.376 --> 38:03.045
But we'll just be drinking tea.

38:35.102 --> 38:36.430
Here it is.

38:37.803 --> 38:39.014
That's it.

38:39.913 --> 38:41.131
In our bed.

39:20.711 --> 39:23.871
Arvid, there's a tasting
of Christmas fare at Rydbergs.

39:24.163 --> 39:27.550
Unfortunately I can't.
I've got too much to do.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.137
Hello.

40:21.122 --> 40:23.561
There are just too many
people in here.

40:25.135 --> 40:26.739
I think the room would be better.

40:30.497 --> 40:31.861
I'll wait for you.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.247
Room 12.

41:03.381 --> 41:05.145
Fancy you saving it!

41:09.330 --> 41:11.096
"Out - I want to get out."

41:14.372 --> 41:15.908
Do you still want to get out?

41:20.806 --> 41:22.348
I suppose I want to go home.

41:23.790 --> 41:25.525
I feel I'm lost.

41:35.181 --> 41:38.585
It's remarkable that things between us
are always going to be melancholy.

41:40.772 --> 41:41.639
Yes...

41:43.817 --> 41:45.077
It's remarkable.

43:27.372 --> 43:32.582
All that's missing is to go through life
without having ever been yours.

44:06.788 --> 44:08.552
Do you love your wife?

44:17.241 --> 44:18.424
We're married.

44:20.500 --> 44:21.978
I've promised to love her.

44:27.221 --> 44:28.249
What about you?

44:34.018 --> 44:35.143
We have a daughter.

44:35.612 --> 44:36.815
So do we.

44:38.161 --> 44:39.207
Marianne.

44:41.205 --> 44:42.324
Anne-Marie.

44:43.988 --> 44:45.253
Nearly the same.

44:47.247 --> 44:48.913
It's not the same!

44:57.455 --> 44:58.811
I don't understand.

45:03.163 --> 45:04.680
I don't understand.

45:05.282 --> 45:06.970
How can you live with Roslin?

45:09.580 --> 45:10.639
How can you?

45:15.997 --> 45:17.844
How can you live with your wife?

45:18.852 --> 45:19.977
How can you?

46:40.444 --> 46:41.913
You're home!?

46:44.955 --> 46:47.911
- Father! Look what we've bought.
- Lovely.

46:48.509 --> 46:49.937
Christmas candy.

46:50.149 --> 46:52.352
You can't come here.
We've bought Christmas presents.

46:53.259 --> 46:54.429
Would you like something?

46:54.454 --> 46:56.655
- We've bought biscuits.
- No thanks.

46:57.122 --> 46:58.703
Are you sure? Tea?

46:59.492 --> 47:00.466
No thanks.

47:01.046 --> 47:02.568
Put some tea on.

47:16.872 --> 47:18.181
Harriet!

47:26.090 --> 47:27.397
It was the mail.

47:39.830 --> 47:41.165
Thanks for that.

47:57.587 --> 47:59.901
Shall we look for things
to decorate the tree?

48:00.049 --> 48:01.632
But nothing out of the garden

48:02.671 --> 48:05.643
The natural decorations
looked crummy last year.

48:06.182 --> 48:08.119
We'll try and have it
looking a bit smart.

48:09.830 --> 48:12.173
<i>Now it's Christmas,
now it's Christmas...</i>

48:12.330 --> 48:14.511
<i>Christmas lasts till Easter.</i>

48:14.830 --> 48:16.797
<i>That's not true,
no, that's not true...</i>

48:16.955 --> 48:19.127
<i>coz in-between comes Lent!</i>

48:19.288 --> 48:21.325
Would you bring in some port.

48:24.062 --> 48:25.593
Don't touch anything yet.

48:29.019 --> 48:32.205
I think the presents are more
for Grandpa than Anne-Marie.

48:32.372 --> 48:34.068
Look how fast it goes, eh?

48:34.910 --> 48:35.964
Father!

48:36.605 --> 48:38.035
Come and look at it, Father!

48:39.330 --> 48:40.403
A bit later.

48:41.317 --> 48:46.033
Suddenly we find Uncle Leif
lying on the kitchen floor, dead drunk.

49:07.413 --> 49:08.589
Lydia, my dear...

49:08.614 --> 49:10.770
It's Christmas Eve... 
We have guests.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.547
I'm coming.

50:08.997 --> 50:10.321
Are you taking a bath now?

50:11.382 --> 50:12.813
I have a headache

50:13.955 --> 50:15.441
I think it was the champagne.

50:25.038 --> 50:27.008
- Didn't you buy that in Paris?
- Yes.

50:31.756 --> 50:34.248
How about you put it on,
when you've had a bath?

50:37.163 --> 50:38.735
I think I'll move out.

50:42.247 --> 50:43.479
I want to go home.

50:45.744 --> 50:47.435
This is your home here.

50:51.122 --> 50:52.348
I want a divorce.

50:55.213 --> 50:56.470
I'm sorry.

50:57.712 --> 50:58.944
Why do you?

51:00.569 --> 51:03.265
Is it the theatre, the social life 
and all that?

51:05.413 --> 51:06.791
The main thing is...

51:08.788 --> 51:10.160
...that I don't love you.

51:11.042 --> 51:13.902
Lydia, I'm a lot older than you,
but I'm not an idiot.

51:16.413 --> 51:18.731
Have I ever asked you 
if you loved me?

51:33.455 --> 51:35.250
I'll do it myself.

52:05.205 --> 52:08.395
Lydia, I've decided that 
it shall be as you wish.

52:10.043 --> 52:11.684
You'll get 3,000 a year.

52:13.622 --> 52:16.643
People shouldn't believe
that you deceived me...

52:17.889 --> 52:20.421
...and that I'm punishing you 
by forcing you into poverty.

52:20.580 --> 52:22.038
People can believe 
what they want.

52:23.202 --> 52:24.632
I don't need that much.

52:26.205 --> 52:27.251
Come here   .

52:34.955 --> 52:37.765
I can at least let you have
some decent furniture?

52:43.580 --> 52:44.476
Thanks.

52:54.747 --> 52:55.693
But Marianne...

52:56.230 --> 52:58.555
Of course she'll stay here with me.

53:04.837 --> 53:06.947
You're the one who's decided to leave.

53:09.955 --> 53:11.388
Not without Marianne.

53:12.630 --> 53:14.707
You didn't even want 
to have any children.

53:15.330 --> 53:17.421
No... but I do now.

53:19.288 --> 53:22.461
It's best she doesn't end up 
becoming someone like you.

54:17.608 --> 54:18.780
Marianne...

54:20.584 --> 54:22.030
Won't you open the door?

54:28.622 --> 54:30.717
I promise we'll see each other again.

55:00.721 --> 55:03.380
Spring arrives

55:13.955 --> 55:15.760
Good morning.

55:19.580 --> 55:20.787
Good morning.

55:27.455 --> 55:28.840
It's 9 o'clock.

55:29.902 --> 55:32.188
The sun is shining and 
we begin with Pettersson.

55:32.814 --> 55:36.251
He prepares his photo plates
and gets himself over to Parliament House.

55:37.997 --> 55:41.796
Lovein will cover 
the Enskilda Bank announcements.

55:42.216 --> 55:43.637
Last, but not least...

55:46.184 --> 55:49.636
Comrade Lidner,
our new foreign correspondent!

55:49.706 --> 55:50.868
- Welcome!
- Thanks.

55:51.128 --> 55:52.124
Spasibo!

55:58.956 --> 56:01.076
What countries 
have you worked in, Lidner?

56:01.936 --> 56:03.576
Russia and Denmark.

56:04.018 --> 56:06.715
But Stockholm is the only place 
where I can sleep well.

56:07.395 --> 56:09.514
Are you still writing short stories?

56:09.858 --> 56:12.004
No, I'm better at politics.

56:12.750 --> 56:15.336
Mr Lidner is a Bolshevik.

56:16.628 --> 56:17.526
Yes.

56:18.321 --> 56:19.727
- Stjaernblom.
- Thanks.

56:55.293 --> 56:56.567
Are you going to the theatre?

56:57.901 --> 56:59.442
No, not this evening.

57:00.543 --> 57:02.153
I would've liked to gone 
with you, otherwise.

57:02.300 --> 57:03.479
Where are you going?

57:05.379 --> 57:07.100
I intend learning Russian.

57:08.288 --> 57:13.328
Lidner, our new foreign corespondent,
is going to give me lessons.

57:16.781 --> 57:19.008
- Couldn't you do that here?
- No...

57:19.955 --> 57:22.753
We're doing it at his place.
It's too late to change.

57:24.612 --> 57:26.750
- Where does he live?
- In a boarding house.

57:30.622 --> 57:31.868
Thanks for dinner.

58:11.288 --> 58:12.532
Come   in!

58:32.437 --> 58:34.117
Wine. Grapes.

58:38.193 --> 58:39.677
Pears.

58:43.297 --> 58:44.563
Lydia.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.400
You must never write to me again.

58:51.430 --> 58:53.594
It burns a hole in my pocket 
all day long.

58:54.663 --> 58:56.447
I wanted to show you 
my new home.

59:00.955 --> 59:03.332
- Did you see the name on the door?
- Yes.

59:05.747 --> 59:07.087
Your own name.

59:14.872 --> 59:16.523
These are here for us.

59:56.663 --> 59:57.858
I've missed you.

59:59.233 --> 01:00:00.896
I've missed you so much!

01:02:00.538 --> 01:02:01.879
Open it.

01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:10.182
No, but...!

01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:14.670
Can we afford this, Arvid?

01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:18.009
We'll see...

01:02:20.873 --> 01:02:22.357
It's beautiful!

01:02:22.663 --> 01:02:24.827
You just bought it for no reason?

01:02:26.116 --> 01:02:27.304
Yes...

01:02:29.757 --> 01:02:31.214
I saw it...

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.448
and I thought...

01:02:34.456 --> 01:02:35.839
that you had to have it.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.189
Did you see it?

01:02:40.677 --> 01:02:42.573
Lovely. A heart.

01:02:48.538 --> 01:02:49.975
Things are good with us, eh?

01:02:52.923 --> 01:02:54.087
Father...

01:02:54.376 --> 01:02:56.284
Say something in Russian.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:06.529
Good dayski, little Anne-Mariski.

01:03:06.725 --> 01:03:09.468
No! In real Russian!

01:03:11.372 --> 01:03:15.672
Shall we danceki, little Mariski?
Come on, Mumski.

01:03:22.483 --> 01:03:24.404
I'd just like to see...

01:03:28.955 --> 01:03:30.535
Did you see, Anne-Marie?

01:03:30.668 --> 01:03:32.983
It goes perfectly.
Don't you think?

01:03:38.054 --> 01:03:39.624
There... pleasant journey.

01:03:42.433 --> 01:03:44.507
You need to hurry now.
The train leaves soon.

01:03:45.163 --> 01:03:47.573
Father should come too!

01:03:48.003 --> 01:03:49.652
Anne-Marie dear...!

01:03:49.955 --> 01:03:52.722
Father has to work 
to get the newspaper out.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:55.501
It can come out 
when summer's over!

01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:59.070
Grandpa misses you.
He'll be so happy to see you.

01:04:12.546 --> 01:04:14.429
Have a lovely summer, now.

01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:17.488
Bye bye!

01:05:02.747 --> 01:05:04.277
It feels so small.

01:05:34.744 --> 01:05:35.831
Come in !

01:06:30.601 --> 01:06:31.749
Come here.

01:06:54.512 --> 01:06:55.679
Paris.

01:06:57.459 --> 01:06:58.500
London.

01:06:59.196 --> 01:07:00.400
Ah, London...!

01:07:00.663 --> 01:07:01.759
Venice.

01:07:03.955 --> 01:07:05.096
Rome.

01:07:06.765 --> 01:07:08.348
I'd love to go to Rome.

01:07:09.909 --> 01:07:11.230
Or the moon.

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:14.948
Uppsala.

01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:19.752
I'd prefer the moon to Uppsala.

01:07:22.752 --> 01:07:24.242
We'll go to the moon.

01:07:26.747 --> 01:07:28.105
You and I .

01:08:23.482 --> 01:08:25.357
I like being with you.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.118
I love you.

01:08:37.872 --> 01:08:39.854
Last week I met a man.

01:08:40.694 --> 01:08:42.319
An author I know.

01:08:42.787 --> 01:08:44.194
Used to know.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:47.258
In what way did you know him?

01:08:48.747 --> 01:08:50.676
No, nothing like that...

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:53.715
We saw each other for a while.

01:08:54.629 --> 01:08:56.513
There was nothing serious about it.

01:08:57.444 --> 01:08:58.380
When was this?

01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:00.475
A few years ago.

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:03.611
A few years ago? 
You were married.

01:09:04.787 --> 01:09:06.444
Just like you.

01:09:08.747 --> 01:09:10.471
When we said goodbye...

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.027
An author?

01:09:13.497 --> 01:09:15.350
Yes. He writes short stories.

01:09:16.705 --> 01:09:19.377
They're pretty good. 
Sad.

01:09:22.834 --> 01:09:25.560
You would have thought 
he had no talent.

01:09:25.803 --> 01:09:27.319
I'm sure of that.

01:09:30.053 --> 01:09:31.850
When we said goodbye...

01:09:35.412 --> 01:09:36.975
...I felt quite empty.

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:39.863
I hadn't realised...

01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:42.221
that he'd meant anything to me.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:43.465
What's his name?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.965
That's irrelevant.

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.997
You mean something to me.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.225
I love you.

01:10:07.243 --> 01:10:08.688
Give me a kiss.

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:49.740
I'm hungry. There wouldn't be 
many people there on a Sunday?

01:10:51.663 --> 01:10:53.754
And who would there be 
to recognise us?

01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:59.164
- I'll refrain from kissing you.
- No you won't.

01:11:13.288 --> 01:11:14.685
Stjaernblom.

01:11:15.076 --> 01:11:16.146
Mrs Roslin.

01:11:16.287 --> 01:11:17.224
Hi.

01:11:17.832 --> 01:11:19.199
Markel.

01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:21.027
It's been a long time.

01:11:22.824 --> 01:11:24.072
I'm not interrupting?

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.557
Not at all.

01:11:25.955 --> 01:11:28.840
A telegram came for you yesterday.

01:11:30.029 --> 01:11:31.521
We didn't know 
where to find you.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.455
Thanks .

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:50.914
What the hell...?

01:11:59.288 --> 01:12:00.985
My father's fallen ill.

01:12:02.806 --> 01:12:04.462
I'll have to go up there.

01:12:06.205 --> 01:12:07.722
Have you been looking for me?

01:12:10.753 --> 01:12:11.988
We haven't... no.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:17.458
You mustn't think 
that Mrs Roslin and I...

01:12:17.798 --> 01:12:18.969
Lydia?

01:12:20.277 --> 01:12:22.504
No you mustn't think that... eh...

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:24.883
Take the morning train to Vaermland.

01:12:28.828 --> 01:12:30.176
For your wife's sake.

01:12:31.562 --> 01:12:33.242
I like her a lot.

01:12:36.622 --> 01:12:37.986
Your wife, too.

01:12:38.984 --> 01:12:41.180
I wouldn't mind having 
such a marriage myself.

01:12:43.663 --> 01:12:45.108
It's not too late.

01:12:54.909 --> 01:12:57.112
Shall I sharpen your pencils as well?

01:12:58.692 --> 01:12:59.846
No thanks.

01:13:08.665 --> 01:13:10.071
Is it serious?

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.923
She never would've written otherwise.

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:22.458
Does she know anything 
about us?

01:13:22.779 --> 01:13:23.794
No.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.068
You mustn't go.

01:13:32.872 --> 01:13:35.201
This is our summer.
It isn't over yet.

01:13:39.163 --> 01:13:40.443
I have no choice.

01:13:48.763 --> 01:13:50.497
These days...

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:55.311
These nights. This must be 
the best time of our lives.

01:13:58.163 --> 01:13:59.640
I'm married, Lydia.

01:14:01.765 --> 01:14:03.670
And my father is ill.

01:14:11.788 --> 01:14:12.812
Go then.

01:14:14.955 --> 01:14:16.320
Get out of here.

01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:58.890
Hello? Roslin residence.

01:14:59.446 --> 01:15:01.157
Many happy returns of the day!

01:15:01.772 --> 01:15:03.817
Mummy! When are you coming?

01:15:05.872 --> 01:15:08.608
I'll show you my new dress 
when you come.

01:15:09.997 --> 01:15:11.844
Did you get it from Father?

01:15:12.836 --> 01:15:14.640
It's white, and has lace.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.755
Can I have the phone?

01:15:22.705 --> 01:15:23.886
Roslin.

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.386
It's Lydia.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:29.209
I just wanted to wish Marianne
a happy birthday.

01:15:30.038 --> 01:15:33.109
Well, now that you've done that,
we'll say goodbye.

01:15:34.126 --> 01:15:35.158
Wait, Markus...

01:15:36.028 --> 01:15:38.074
Couldn't I drop by
and say hello?

01:15:38.691 --> 01:15:39.869
We've said goodbye.

01:15:40.455 --> 01:15:42.521
I want to talk to Mummy!

01:16:16.622 --> 01:16:18.162
Is it you?

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:27.318
You alright?

01:16:29.705 --> 01:16:30.624
Yes.

01:16:33.955 --> 01:16:35.300
It's a beautiful summer.

01:16:38.705 --> 01:16:40.012
I'm almost...

01:16:42.788 --> 01:16:45.024
I could say that I'm happy.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.647
Happy?

01:16:50.218 --> 01:16:51.694
Can a person be that?

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.558
Happiness, Arvid...

01:17:10.567 --> 01:17:13.457
It can ruin your life.

01:17:17.081 --> 01:17:18.675
And others'.

01:19:26.413 --> 01:19:27.945
I love you .

01:19:49.258 --> 01:19:51.960
So summer went.

01:20:25.305 --> 01:20:26.750
Good evening.

01:20:27.955 --> 01:20:29.398
Lidner.

01:20:30.663 --> 01:20:32.425
What an evening, eh?

01:20:34.896 --> 01:20:38.274
I'm just waiting for a lady,
so I'm a bit...

01:20:39.097 --> 01:20:40.261
Dagmar Stjaernblom.

01:20:41.409 --> 01:20:44.267
Carl Lidner...
Foreign correspondent.

01:20:46.122 --> 01:20:49.823
Oh, yes... You're the one
teaching my husband Russian.

01:20:51.372 --> 01:20:53.973
- Shall we go in?
- Yes... of course.

01:20:55.163 --> 01:20:58.602
Would Mr Lidner be able 
to understand every word?

01:20:58.892 --> 01:21:01.114
It's a ballet.
It's all dancing.

01:21:02.955 --> 01:21:04.337
Good evening!

01:21:04.782 --> 01:21:06.188
Good evening.

01:21:24.622 --> 01:21:26.069
Good evening again.

01:21:29.321 --> 01:21:32.876
This is my friend, 
Miss Lydia Stille.

01:21:34.809 --> 01:21:36.356
Mrs Stjaernblom.

01:21:37.332 --> 01:21:38.770
Dagmar.

01:22:47.485 --> 01:22:49.443
I would probably have danced differently.

01:22:50.224 --> 01:22:51.889
But it was a lovely performance.

01:22:52.747 --> 01:22:55.343
Your colleague Lidner...

01:22:56.468 --> 01:22:57.901
He seemed very moved, too.

01:23:02.565 --> 01:23:03.729
Can you help me?

01:23:17.319 --> 01:23:19.036
I need to go in to the office.

01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:21.466
- Now?
- Yes.

01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:28.005
- Shall I wait for you?
- No.

01:24:34.978 --> 01:24:36.978
Was he the one 
you told me about?

01:24:39.038 --> 01:24:40.479
Lydia?

01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:42.049
Is it Lidner?

01:24:44.122 --> 01:24:46.281
Tell me the truth.
Is it Lidner?

01:24:48.163 --> 01:24:50.076
- Is it Lidner?!
- Yes!

01:24:58.038 --> 01:24:59.283
Was it here?

01:24:59.576 --> 01:25:01.127
Was it in bed, here?

01:25:02.252 --> 01:25:03.736
Did it happen there?

01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:05.621
You are mine.

01:25:06.512 --> 01:25:09.364
You can't give yourself to others.
It's unworthy...

01:25:09.912 --> 01:25:10.982
Cheap!

01:25:11.067 --> 01:25:12.808
What about you?!

01:25:15.449 --> 01:25:17.050
I'll never forgive this.

01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:19.644
I've never asked 
for your forgiveness.

01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:22.503
There's a side to you
that I deeply dislike!

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.863
Everything you've done 
has been for your own sake.

01:25:26.231 --> 01:25:28.872
Married for money...
Deceived your husband...

01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:31.025
You did exactly the same!

01:26:21.251 --> 01:26:22.557
Hello.

01:26:24.742 --> 01:26:27.682
I'm wondering what 
I can get for these.

01:26:29.079 --> 01:26:32.334
One to Katrineholm, return.

01:26:35.622 --> 01:26:36.657
Mrs Roslin...

01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:39.327
Has something happened?

01:26:39.535 --> 01:26:40.579
Is Mr Roslin in?

01:26:40.637 --> 01:26:41.933
He's in the laboratory.

01:26:43.268 --> 01:26:45.530
He's said I'm to tell you 
you're not welcome here.

01:26:46.468 --> 01:26:48.069
I just want to see Marianne.

01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:50.038
He told me to say... No.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.558
This can't be done.

01:26:54.355 --> 01:26:55.862
He can't do it.

01:26:57.955 --> 01:27:01.446
Mr Roslin will call the authorities, 
if you don't leave the premises.

01:28:06.330 --> 01:28:07.892
Has something happened?

01:28:28.054 --> 01:28:29.375
Thanks.

01:28:42.413 --> 01:28:43.755
Hold me tight.

01:28:59.622 --> 01:29:00.869
I've missed you.

01:29:07.288 --> 01:29:09.225
I've missed you so much.

01:29:28.747 --> 01:29:29.850
I love you.

01:29:33.791 --> 01:29:35.065
I love you so much.

01:29:38.694 --> 01:29:39.958
I'm sorry.

01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:43.593
I should never have come.

01:29:45.784 --> 01:29:47.425
I'm glad you came.

01:29:47.784 --> 01:29:50.148
No... I have to go.

01:29:50.414 --> 01:29:54.664
No. No, no, you shan't go!
No, Lydia, Lydia...

01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:57.529
No, Lydia, you shan't go.
You're to stay with me.

01:29:58.443 --> 01:29:59.905
Stop it, Carl!

01:30:02.357 --> 01:30:03.810
Let me take you home.

01:30:06.705 --> 01:30:08.265
No, you're to forget me.

01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:07.140
Lydia?

01:33:09.545 --> 01:33:10.850
Lydia!

01:33:13.497 --> 01:33:14.973
Open the door!

01:33:15.825 --> 01:33:17.307
Aren't you going to open?

01:33:24.372 --> 01:33:25.785
Why don't you open it?

01:33:26.098 --> 01:33:27.067
Lydia...

01:33:29.791 --> 01:33:31.221
I know you're there.

01:33:41.191 --> 01:33:43.168
You can at least snuff the candles.

01:33:47.543 --> 01:33:49.027
It doesn't matter.

01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:53.661
You're here now.

01:35:29.247 --> 01:35:31.302
Lidner committed suicide.

01:35:35.247 --> 01:35:36.954
They found him 
at his boarding house.

01:35:37.146 --> 01:35:38.126
How?

01:35:45.955 --> 01:35:47.424
Why didn't he say something?

01:35:48.775 --> 01:35:50.463
Didn't you suspect anything?

01:35:57.663 --> 01:35:59.496
Did he have no friends in town?

01:36:35.282 --> 01:36:36.544
He's dead.

01:36:38.888 --> 01:36:41.678
- What do you mean? Who...?
- He committed suicide.

01:36:42.748 --> 01:36:43.741
Who?

01:36:45.788 --> 01:36:46.794
Lidner.

01:37:01.205 --> 01:37:03.123
I don't dare see you any more.

01:38:34.413 --> 01:38:36.320
- Don't you want anything to eat?
- No thanks..

01:38:50.455 --> 01:38:52.093
I've done something stupid, Arvid.

01:38:53.695 --> 01:38:55.581
I'd find that hard to believe.

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:59.278
A letter came for you
and I read it.

01:39:02.538 --> 01:39:03.617
Who from?

01:39:06.955 --> 01:39:08.204
Who from?

01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:12.302
I don't understand 
what she could imagine.

01:39:13.330 --> 01:39:16.060
When she writes here, to our family.
To our home..

01:39:22.288 --> 01:39:23.763
I'm going away.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.787
What do you mean? 
Where are you going?

01:39:30.873 --> 01:39:32.170
I have to get away from here.

01:39:34.287 --> 01:39:35.382
What are you saying?

01:39:36.005 --> 01:39:37.006
I have to get out

01:39:42.748 --> 01:39:44.795
- What do you mean?
- I want a divorce.

01:39:48.455 --> 01:39:50.601
I'll make sure 
it'll be alright for you.

01:39:51.586 --> 01:39:52.906
But I want a divorce.

01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:58.794
You are such a...

01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:00.880
loving...

01:40:02.071 --> 01:40:04.247
...kind and refined husband.

01:40:04.919 --> 01:40:06.653
And I love you so much.

01:40:11.247 --> 01:40:13.186
We can just forget it altogether.

01:40:19.061 --> 01:40:21.468
I know she's sacrificed 
a lot for you...

01:40:22.497 --> 01:40:24.923
...but I'm the one 
married to you, Arvid.

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.261
Arvid, I can't get divorced.

01:40:47.622 --> 01:40:49.351
I do NOT agree with it!

01:40:50.997 --> 01:40:53.272
Did you hear me?
I don't agree with it!

01:41:25.327 --> 01:41:26.397
Arvid?

01:41:33.205 --> 01:41:34.626
I'm frightened.

01:42:18.454 --> 01:42:19.816
You'll come to love me.

01:42:20.803 --> 01:42:22.335
I'm your best friend.

01:42:26.288 --> 01:42:28.315
And the physical has always 
been so good.

01:42:35.848 --> 01:42:36.911
No.

01:42:37.479 --> 01:42:40.713
What could I have done differently?
Tell me where I went wrong?

01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:48.378
- We've had it so good!
- Stop it!

01:42:48.499 --> 01:42:50.437
- You live as you please.
- Stop it!

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.096
Our marriage is built on a lie.

01:42:53.624 --> 01:42:55.007
It's best for all if I go.

01:42:55.455 --> 01:42:57.115
I don't want to go.

01:43:00.997 --> 01:43:02.468
No, you don't have to go anywhere.

01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:06.353
Listen to me.

01:43:07.642 --> 01:43:08.830
Daddy's going away.

01:43:09.741 --> 01:43:12.180
He's leaving you and me?
Understand?

01:43:16.955 --> 01:43:19.878
- I don't know what I'll do!
- Let go!

01:43:20.038 --> 01:43:22.857
Come on now...
Let go!

01:43:28.705 --> 01:43:30.739
Where have you been 
seeing each other?

01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:34.448
Was it here?
How often was it?

01:43:37.288 --> 01:43:38.746
Tell me!

01:43:40.622 --> 01:43:42.727
- How often did you see her?
- Stop it!

01:43:45.604 --> 01:43:46.667
What?!

01:43:52.413 --> 01:43:54.540
I do love you,
but not the same way.

01:45:34.876 --> 01:45:36.875
The National Daily is
going to miss you.

01:45:36.992 --> 01:45:38.375
Let's sit down, shall we?

01:45:38.478 --> 01:45:41.632
- I will write every day.
- Yes, but as a human being.

01:45:43.282 --> 01:45:45.075
Send personal telegrams.

01:45:45.293 --> 01:45:48.156
I want to know what
you think of Europe.

01:45:48.789 --> 01:45:50.872
Whether it goes in
the paper or not.

01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:53.105
Better still, change plans 
and stay.

01:45:53.308 --> 01:45:54.973
I won't change my mind.

01:45:57.497 --> 01:45:58.696
When's your train go?

01:46:00.095 --> 01:46:01.370
How about lunch?

01:46:01.915 --> 01:46:04.753
We can look at the solar eclipse.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.637
I'll miss you, Arvid.

01:46:09.705 --> 01:46:10.612
Let go!

01:46:15.116 --> 01:46:17.155
Shall you write up the eclipse, Lovein?

01:46:18.455 --> 01:46:21.046
Yes I am. This is idiotic.

01:46:21.507 --> 01:46:22.980
I look like a raccoon.

01:46:26.247 --> 01:46:28.501
Might I offer you lunch, 
Miss Zeijlon.

01:46:31.303 --> 01:46:32.842
We can get a window table.

01:46:34.195 --> 01:46:36.914
Yes, thank you.
That would be nice.

01:46:42.594 --> 01:46:45.259
- Goodbye!
- Bon voyage!

01:48:27.413 --> 01:48:29.418
I've missed you so much!

01:48:31.538 --> 01:48:32.630
Me too.

01:48:33.372 --> 01:48:34.606
That's good!

01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:41.921
A single to Hamburg.
Change in Copenhagen .

01:49:06.329 --> 01:49:07.204
Hello.

01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:09.463
Hello.

01:49:14.455 --> 01:49:16.796
This is my daughter, Marianne.

01:49:17.921 --> 01:49:20.434
Marianne, Arvid Stjaernblom, who's...

01:49:22.747 --> 01:49:24.012
...an old friend.

01:49:31.951 --> 01:49:33.303
Hurry up, Mummy!
