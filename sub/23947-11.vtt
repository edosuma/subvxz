00:38.455 --> 00:39.289
That's it.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.593
Keith.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.599
You're pretty amazing.
But this is as far as you go.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.977
I'm going to put an end to this.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.859
Keith.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.404
Lily!

02:35.739 --> 02:36.573
Bran!

02:37.240 --> 02:38.408
Are you okay?

02:39.576 --> 02:40.994
That's my line!

02:41.453 --> 02:43.872
You have to stay lying down.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.626
How long was I out?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.378
Just a few hours.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.464
W-Wait, what are you--

02:53.965 --> 02:54.966
My clothes!

02:55.133 --> 02:57.552
-I tore my stitches!
-Where are my clothes?

03:17.989 --> 03:21.034
He'll come. Koku will come.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.327
He'll come.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.042
<i>A ship hidden among the stars.</i>

04:34.316 --> 04:36.902
Stop it, Minatsuki. Calm down.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.529
Can't you hear the alarm?

04:40.363 --> 04:42.157
He's already close.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.536
He's coming?

04:48.955 --> 04:49.790
Who's coming?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.666
Minatsuki?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.130
You mean him!

04:58.632 --> 04:59.466
You...

05:01.176 --> 05:05.889
So sorry, I just remembered.
I was going to kill him.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.726
Kill. I'll kill them all.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.020
Then it'll be over.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.190
Kill. Kill.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.067
Kill.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.319
Kill.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.116
I suppose he'll at least buy us some time.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.747
It's just like the myth says.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.334
As I thought, it's not going to end here.

05:37.921 --> 05:42.050
The inscription desires that the ending
take place at that spot.

05:57.649 --> 05:58.483
That's it.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.585
Yuna.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.848
Silver nuptial coloration...

06:32.350 --> 06:34.352
This marks the beginning of the end.

06:36.313 --> 06:40.859
As well as the hour when
a new black-winged king will be crowned.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.745
Welcome aboard the <i>Moby Dick.</i>

06:53.788 --> 06:57.792
I thought you'd never get here,
Black-winged King.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.048
Right here and now,
I'll take everything you have...

07:03.715 --> 07:05.634
and become lord of all creation!

07:15.518 --> 07:16.645
You're sure?

07:16.853 --> 07:17.687
Yes.

07:17.979 --> 07:18.813
Boris!

07:19.814 --> 07:23.485
Just like you thought,
these bodies have all been embalmed.

07:24.194 --> 07:28.740
Given the number of them, it must cost
eight figures to keep this place running.

07:29.366 --> 07:34.955
So it's like Eric said. Just one person
couldn't run this facility, huh?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.623
That's my thought.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.132
Eric! It's Lily!

07:46.716 --> 07:47.550
Lily?

07:47.676 --> 07:48.885
Has she woken up?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.848
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

07:54.182 --> 07:56.643
-Lily, it's Boris! We're--
<i>-Where's Keith?</i>

07:57.602 --> 07:58.436
Keith?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.984
Isn't Keith at the hospital?
We thought he was there with you.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.487
<i>He mentioned returning to the scene
<i>of the crime... three hours ago.</i></i>

08:07.821 --> 08:08.697
What?

08:09.155 --> 08:13.910
<i>Just before Gilbert escaped,
<i>he put a capsule or something in my mouth.</i></i>

08:14.744 --> 08:19.290
<i>Keith took it out while he was carrying me
<i>and then said something.</i></i>

08:20.291 --> 08:21.126
Eric!

08:21.918 --> 08:22.752
Lily!

08:23.128 --> 08:25.130
We're coming to you! Sit tight!

08:25.380 --> 08:26.256
<i>Will do!</i>

09:17.098 --> 09:18.349
Where is Yuna?

09:19.934 --> 09:22.395
If you tell me,
I'll give you a quick death.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.358
Yuna?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.111
Who's that?

09:33.865 --> 09:34.699
Wait.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.369
Who...

09:40.205 --> 09:41.039
am I?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.499
<i>Reggie.</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:06.773
<i>-Reggie.
-Who's that?</i>

10:07.398 --> 10:08.733
Withdrawal symptoms?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.195
You're a Reggie?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.572
Reggie?

10:16.449 --> 10:17.700
We don't need Reggies.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.244
Kill them all.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.832
Actually, this will be perfect.
I'll use this Reggie.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.044
His eyes are the same color as mine.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.506
I know it.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.633
I...

10:34.384 --> 10:35.927
That eye...

10:37.137 --> 10:38.263
I know it!

10:39.681 --> 10:40.557
I know it.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.143
I know it.

10:44.269 --> 10:45.186
I know it.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.438
I know it.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.790
Don't be afraid.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.459
Look deep into my eye.

11:09.752 --> 11:13.089
From now on, you will be my phantom.

11:18.261 --> 11:21.055
Just as I was his.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.435
Who...

11:26.185 --> 11:27.020
are you?

11:30.857 --> 11:31.691
Who...

11:33.484 --> 11:34.360
I...

11:36.195 --> 11:39.616
Who am I?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.296
Don't let it end here.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.400
This isn't him.

12:16.945 --> 12:17.779
Yuna.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.980
Yuna, you were waiting for me.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.905
She waited for me.

13:44.991 --> 13:49.704
She waited for me, but again, I was...

14:24.864 --> 14:26.240
What took you so long?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.995
I was getting worried
you wouldn't crack it.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.298
We used to use that cipher all the time
to pass notes in class, remember?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.931
Doesn't that take you back?

14:52.809 --> 14:54.769
<i>Badmouthing the professors.</i>

14:54.852 --> 14:57.855
<i>Asking if our nemesis was there.
<i>Our favorite records.</i></i>

14:59.065 --> 15:03.403
Yours was Blue Ã–yster Cult.
Mine was Thin Lizzy.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.364
<i>Yours was Kate Bush.</i>

15:10.034 --> 15:10.993
Hurry over.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.124
<i>This place has seen better days,
<i>but it's just like it was back then.</i></i>

15:19.585 --> 15:21.587
He said he'll put an end to this!

15:22.672 --> 15:24.841
Those were Keith's exact words to you?

15:24.924 --> 15:25.758
Yes!

15:25.842 --> 15:29.762
That means he's going to the murder scene,
right? Up in the mountains?

15:30.263 --> 15:33.599
That's where her body was dumped,
not where she was killed.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.103
The place where Erika was murdered was...

15:40.648 --> 15:41.691
Tell me one thing.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.651
<i>What?</i>

15:44.527 --> 15:48.698
You couldn't have carried it out
on your own authority. Who ordered it?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.076
<i>You mean the attack?</i>

15:53.202 --> 15:54.036
That's simple.

15:55.079 --> 15:59.417
Jaula Blanca's main product
was the living weapons called Reggies.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.338
The king and military couldn't care less
about resurrecting gods.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.966
Success was the last thing they wanted.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.889
And I'll let you in on one other detail:

16:13.681 --> 16:17.685
The one who both proposed
and led the attack was me.

16:20.021 --> 16:23.357
I let Minatsuki kill Dr. Kazama.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.862
Children are the strangest things.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.281
If it's what they want to hear,

16:30.698 --> 16:32.700
<i>they'll even believe lies.</i>

16:39.790 --> 16:42.710
Why weren't you controlled by him?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.799
You mean the ability
of Minatsuki's right eye?

16:50.051 --> 16:52.803
<i>You know why. You're asking anyway?</i>

16:54.972 --> 16:57.016
Because you were controlling him.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.981
When it comes to childhood beliefs,

17:04.690 --> 17:08.236
unless the child sees irrefutable proof
with its own two eyes,

17:08.319 --> 17:10.070
those beliefs will never fade.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.031
It's a sort of hypnosis, you see.

17:13.657 --> 17:15.576
It was a clumsy lie,

17:16.202 --> 17:17.494
<i>and yet he believed it.</i>

17:18.496 --> 17:20.748
<i>Even now, he believes if he kills Koku</i>

17:20.830 --> 17:26.295
as set out in the inscription, he can rule
over a new world as its invincible king.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.882
<i>How many?</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:35.054
<i>How many lives will you toy with
<i>before you're satisfied?</i></i>

17:41.519 --> 17:42.562
Surely you see it.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.065
I will never feel satisfied.

17:48.859 --> 17:52.697
I... have to kill to live.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.829
But the thing is, Keith... Think about it.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.624
You're the same as me. Don't you agree?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.879
My impulse to kill
and your impulse to study.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.718
We're the same in that
neither one of us can control ourselves.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.806
That's a trait common to all Flicks.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.394
Erika wasn't able to keep her emotions
under control.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.396
So I...

18:32.278 --> 18:34.280
We both belong to cursed bloodlines.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.866
Let's put an end to this.

19:31.712 --> 19:36.592
The glyph for "black" is repeatedly used
as a synonym for "perfect" here.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.472
Do you know how you make the color black?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.059
You mix all colors together.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.981
That's why black stands apart
from all other colors.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.693
It's the perfect color.

19:54.402 --> 19:55.736
A color fit for a king.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.243
You don't know, do you?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.913
Why it is I'm doing this.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.292
I listened to you.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.798
I listened to your voices in the distance
through the window.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.302
I passed the time,
imagining what everyone was like.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.557
Until Izanami came,
I had been alone my entire life.

20:26.684 --> 20:27.893
I wanted to know.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.147
Why only I was kept isolated.

20:36.193 --> 20:39.864
On that tumultuous night,
he told me everything.

20:41.907 --> 20:45.745
I was created and kept alive
just to be spare parts for Koku.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.873
My fate was to be carved up as we grew,

20:48.956 --> 20:51.959
and eventually be put down
like a stray dog.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.964
That's why my existence isn't recorded
in the inscription.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.510
I was... nothing more than a phantom.

21:06.807 --> 21:11.103
He's the only Reggie who was successfully
stabilized through treatment

21:11.604 --> 21:14.440
and showed no signs
of rejecting Koku's eye.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.735
He was kept in strict isolation.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.653
It's only natural.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.324
If the military learned of his existence,
he would be eliminated.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.787
The last hope for stabilizing the Reggies.

21:30.039 --> 21:30.998
I get it now.

21:32.833 --> 21:36.837
The real target
of that attack was Minatsuki?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.383
I didn't want to believe it.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.179
I fought with all my might
against the inscription.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.640
But it was hopeless.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.898
The first time I saw his eye,
that convinced me it was all true.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.567
And so I swore to myself.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.654
Whatever it took,

22:03.155 --> 22:06.867
I would steal everything from him.

22:09.078 --> 22:09.912
You can't.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.421
Koku will never lose.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.425
So... you won't be able to steal anything.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.555
You don't get it, do you?

22:35.312 --> 22:36.230
Can't you see?

22:37.106 --> 22:41.110
We're all playing out our roles
exactly as written in this inscription.

22:41.318 --> 22:46.156
Life, death, everything.
There's no fighting it.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.578
We're nothing more than bit players
in a repeating story.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.413
Which is why...

22:53.038 --> 22:54.373
you and Koku will...

22:55.791 --> 22:56.750
die here.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.795
Yuna!
