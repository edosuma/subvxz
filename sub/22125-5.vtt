WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:03.070
We've taken your son, and
you've taken my country.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.910
This is our son. You have to talk to me.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.870
What was so important that you
couldn't bring George swimming?

00:08.920 --> 00:10.750
A reporter -- Martha Franklin.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.550
I had to get back the film,
and I had to destroy it.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.640
Did you tell your wife where
you were going on Christmas day?

00:17.840 --> 00:19.110
I don't want a baby.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.950
I don't want two babies.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.990
The boy?

00:22.040 --> 00:23.310
~

00:23.360 --> 00:24.520
They've taken the boy.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.590
I think the NLF took Malik to force Yusra.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.310
This suggests you're wrong about that.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.910
Have you got it? Do you know where he is?

00:30.960 --> 00:32.030
You have to move fast.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.510
This is your one chance.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.520
Joe, I think it's George.
We've got him. George!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.480
- George, come on!
- Hey!

00:40.840 --> 00:41.830
George!

00:46.560 --> 00:50.460
We're going to get you to a hospital, but you
bloody well stay with me, OK? Do you hear?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.710
Breathe, breathe, come on!

00:59.960 --> 01:01.400
Help!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:11.720 --> 01:12.830
Why can't he breathe?

01:12.880 --> 01:16.670
Collapsed lung. His chest cavity is
full of air so his lung can't reinflate.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.430
- This way! - We need
to go. - This way! - Go!

01:19.480 --> 01:24.320
You stay with us, OK? Jesus
Christ! You stay with us, damn it!

01:25.600 --> 01:26.640
Damn it!

01:31.200 --> 01:33.590
Take me to the hospital now!

01:33.640 --> 01:36.030
They're all out, ma'am, looking
for George -- the whole unit.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.350
It's just me.

01:37.400 --> 01:42.350
So you drive me. What's the
bloody problem, Orchover?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.950
An officer's wife has to be...

01:44.000 --> 01:46.350
What? What?

01:46.400 --> 01:48.430
Protected, ma'am. Someone
needs to ride shotgun.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.040
I can't drive you and keep
you safe at the same time.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.910
- Well, give me your gun.
- Ma'am?

01:54.960 --> 01:58.150
Give me your stupid gun
and I'll protect myself.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.190
I don't think I...

01:59.240 --> 02:02.030
My husband has been
shot! He needs me there.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.160
Christ, has the Army shut
your brain down, Corporal?

02:17.160 --> 02:18.200
Is he dying?

02:19.520 --> 02:21.750
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.200
I really don't know, ma'am.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.360
Let's go.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.640
Ed was close.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.520
He nearly made it. He was moments
away from rescuing George.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.360
Your husband is a hero.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.960
Aden -- where East meets West.

04:29.080 --> 04:32.320
Vital as an oil refinery, as
well as a Gulf trade route.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.830
The beach here at Aden is lovely.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.870
The sand is warm,

04:37.920 --> 04:40.240
and the sharks are not always hungry.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.030
The occasional outbreaks of violence are

04:49.080 --> 04:52.160
caused by what are officially
called dissident tribesmen.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.000
As long as there's trouble,
there must be troops.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.470
The Queen has full
confidence in Aden's future,

05:01.520 --> 05:05.080
describing it as the perfect
example of colonial rule.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.910
What's the pressure doing?

05:20.040 --> 05:21.320
Hold him! Hold him down!

06:24.800 --> 06:27.150
What did she think about you?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.270
What's that?

06:28.320 --> 06:32.590
Yusra. You were head over
heels. What about her?

06:32.640 --> 06:33.870
You wouldn't understand.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.920
Ah. The love that passeth
all understanding, eh?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.920
Your understanding, anyway.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.360
Has anyone heard from my husband?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.470
No, ma'am.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.040
Still at the hospital, ma'am.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.600
What are you doing?

06:59.600 --> 07:02.910
The Royal Scots had a grenade
lobbed into the Land Rover.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.000
What happened?

07:05.600 --> 07:06.900
It got stuck under a seat.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.360
Why do they want to do this to us?

07:16.080 --> 07:17.120
Don't know, ma'am.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.960
But we should know, shouldn't we?

07:29.800 --> 07:34.160
The NLF, we think, delivered
the film this morning.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.840
- I want to see it.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.150
I have a right to see
what they did to my son.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.280
- Mary...
- Don't you dare patronise me.

07:47.240 --> 07:53.440
He's my son. You will take me to see
this film, and you will do it now.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.470
- Again.
- Mary.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.560
Play it again.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.000
The parting! In his hair.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.470
What?

09:11.520 --> 09:15.160
Yusra does that. She's
sending us a message, Harry.

09:17.600 --> 09:21.000
She's with him, and she's helping him.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.720
I knew it.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.000
~

09:53.960 --> 09:55.720
~

10:04.360 --> 10:06.200
~

10:09.120 --> 10:11.120
~

10:12.800 --> 10:14.430
Malik! Malik!

10:14.480 --> 10:15.840
~

10:17.080 --> 10:18.670
Malik!

10:18.720 --> 10:23.320
~

10:32.160 --> 10:34.040
You go on, darling. I'll catch you up.

10:47.240 --> 10:51.040
What monsters these people
are. What do they want?

10:53.040 --> 10:56.320
Kadir, in exchange for George.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.760
They're offering a swap, Harry.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.360
There's a rule.

11:12.800 --> 11:13.840
We have a rule.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.960
We don't talk to terrorists.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.120
They have to know where
they stand, these people.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.960
There's one more thing.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.550
But I don't quite know
how to put this, Harry.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.640
Then just say it.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.590
Like with children?

12:21.640 --> 12:22.680
Hm?

12:23.800 --> 12:25.560
We let them get away with it once.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.080
Mary, there's something Harvey
didn't want you to know.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.000
I'm afraid there's a deadline.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.000
How long?

12:49.520 --> 12:50.560
Eight hours.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.440
Does Harvey Tilbrook have children?

13:53.760 --> 13:54.800
Don't go.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.120
Stay with me.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.240
I'm here.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.000
Joe saved your life.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.240
Baxter?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.320
Sir.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.600
At 18.00 hours...

15:19.800 --> 15:21.430
Sir.

15:21.480 --> 15:22.670
At 1800 hours,

15:22.720 --> 15:26.720
I have it on good authority that the
NLF will be ending my son's life.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.240
- I want you to...
- We'll do everything we can, sir.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.670
What's the point, Alec? What
good could it do their cause?

15:42.720 --> 15:45.190
What's in it for them?

15:45.240 --> 15:49.390
They'll say that they made an offer
and that, by refusing that offer,

15:49.440 --> 15:56.160
they'll say that it was us
who killed him, not them.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.920
That's what they'll say, sir.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.950
- You've always been honest
with me, Baxter. - Yes, sir.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.760
That's why I trust you.
That's why I trust you.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.710
Permission to carry on, sir?

16:23.760 --> 16:24.800
Yes, yes, of course.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.200
- Ma'am. - Oh! - I was
looking for the CO.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.840
Come in. Please.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.550
Would you like some lemonade?

17:04.599 --> 17:05.720
No, thank you, ma'am.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.589
I was just making summer
pudding -- George's favourite.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.910
Yes, ma'am.

17:13.480 --> 17:18.470
I wanted to say, um... Sorry,
I know he's not dead, I just...

17:18.520 --> 17:20.520
I just wanted to tell you that, um...

17:22.760 --> 17:24.800
.. he was such a good lad.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.720
Sorry, I keep saying
"was", like he's, um...

17:34.480 --> 17:35.640
I shouldn't have come.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.960
I'm so glad you did, Corporal Stoneham.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.720
People have become frightened of me,
because of what's happened, you see.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.800
But not you.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.600
And I'm very grateful. Thank you.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.830
How's Lieutenant Laithwaite, sir?

18:16.880 --> 18:21.830
He's a fighter, Sergeant. He
wants, very badly, to live.

18:21.880 --> 18:24.030
How did you get him back on your own, sir?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.550
I just did.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.350
Bloody hero, if you don't
mind me saying, sir.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.440
You don't think, do you?
The training takes over.

18:32.480 --> 18:37.200
So not brave, not a hero, just...
being in the British Army.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.520
Just doing your job.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.830
And now that you've
finished buttering me up,

18:44.880 --> 18:46.880
why don't you tell me what it is you want?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.760
It's the CO, sir. He's not himself.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.710
That's hardly surprising.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.630
Would you do me a favour,
sir? Drop the English.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.670
I'm sorry?

18:59.720 --> 19:02.950
Keeping calm and carrying on --
it's just posh folks' idea of virtue,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.080
like cold showers and thrift.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.910
But where I come from, it's all bollocks,

19:08.960 --> 19:10.790
if you'll excuse the Glaswegian.

19:10.840 --> 19:14.560
I'd walk through fire for that man.
In fact, I have -- more than once.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.550
So please don't ever tell him I said this.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.000
It would kill him if he knew.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.880
You've lost trust in him.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.830
He'll get it back.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.680
Yes, sir. But we need
a leader, sir -- now.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.350
I don't know if I can do this, Honor.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.440
Joe!

20:01.880 --> 20:02.920
Mm.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.400
Joe?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.030
My husband's tired.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.680
He wants you to bring me to
the hospital in his place.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.480
Time to go home, Mrs Laithwaite.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.910
I'll stay here, thank you.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.000
You can't do that.

21:13.440 --> 21:18.880
Why not? What will happen?

21:36.080 --> 21:37.120
Is there a problem?

21:38.400 --> 21:39.510
No.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.270
Mrs Laithwaite, visiting hours...

21:41.320 --> 21:45.590
Jesus Christ! Rules, rules, rules!

21:45.640 --> 21:46.630
There's a reason why...

21:46.680 --> 21:49.510
Yes! Everything put in a box.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.950
Everything described
and put in a fucking box

21:52.000 --> 21:54.350
and made never to leave or
else the world might end!

21:54.400 --> 21:57.310
- You're getting needlessly...
- What?

21:57.360 --> 22:01.790
I'm getting out of my box, and you
can't stand it or understand it.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.230
You're a pregnant woman. You
don't know what you're saying.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.800
You're the one making
me have these babies!

22:08.400 --> 22:10.270
What else is there, Mrs Laithwaite?

22:10.320 --> 22:12.200
What exactly am I stopping you doing?

22:13.680 --> 22:16.750
Is there anything more cowardly
than a man asking questions

22:16.800 --> 22:21.310
he already knows the answer to for
the purpose of humiliating someone?

22:21.360 --> 22:23.430
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, yes!

22:23.480 --> 22:26.710
There is something more cowardly
-- a man who avoids answering

22:26.760 --> 22:29.790
a question he doesn't like
by asking a question himself!

22:29.840 --> 22:32.110
Here's my question, Mrs
Laithwaite -- what kind of wife,

22:32.160 --> 22:34.390
with a man as brave as your
husband in the condition

22:34.440 --> 22:36.790
he's in, behaves this selfishly?

22:38.760 --> 22:42.990
The character of my husband? Is that it?

22:43.040 --> 22:46.800
What can a woman possibly complain
about if her husband is a good egg?

22:49.160 --> 22:50.560
And what's wrong with that?

22:52.280 --> 22:58.240
Because he's not me! Because
I exist! Look! Here I am!

22:59.720 --> 23:02.080
A human being, all by myself!

23:03.720 --> 23:04.760
Alison?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.790
Breathe deeply.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.030
Is that what your mother's book says?

23:19.080 --> 23:22.480
How to deal with collapsed
lungs and hysterical women?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.400
No, it's just common sense.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.440
Goodness me, how quickly
you're growing up!

23:34.160 --> 23:39.750
That's what everybody says, isn't
it? Well done, she's crawling!

23:39.800 --> 23:42.190
Her first word! She can walk!

23:42.240 --> 23:46.240
Why are we so desperate
for children to grow up?

23:48.640 --> 23:54.840
All the prizes in life -- coming
of age, getting married...

23:57.160 --> 23:58.920
.. are all for getting older.

24:01.560 --> 24:04.280
Well done on getting closer to death!

24:07.720 --> 24:09.800
Do you remember hurting yourself?

24:11.440 --> 24:12.480
What do you mean?

24:14.360 --> 24:15.480
Falling over.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.480
Wasn't it wonderful?

24:21.240 --> 24:24.150
God, the shock of it!

24:24.200 --> 24:26.580
The ground in your face!

24:26.630 --> 24:29.110
Bam! BAM!

24:29.160 --> 24:30.590
Knees, elbows.

24:30.640 --> 24:34.390
When was the last time you gave
your elbow a second thought?

24:34.440 --> 24:40.440
The taste of fresh scab --
good and salty and bloody.

24:44.120 --> 24:50.600
I miss pain. How far away
from childhood people go.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.200
That's one of the things I love about you.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.520
Sometimes, when I hear you laugh,
I could scream with pleasure.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.800
Don't grow up, Honor.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.560
I'll die if you turn into one of them.

25:17.520 --> 25:18.560
I have to.

25:21.640 --> 25:22.680
I think I have to.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.830
It's a driver escort job for you.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.270
And can't one of the men...?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.360
It has to be you.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.840
But George is...

25:38.520 --> 25:39.560
The deadline, sir.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.640
This takes precedence. The
order comes from high command.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.720
- I'll take Armstrong and Baxter
as my wingmen. - No, no. Just you.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.960
- Can I ask why?
- No.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.960
Strictly need-to-know,
Captain Martin, and hush-hush.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.960
It must be connected to George, sir.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.080
Sir.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.800
What if George were a prince?

26:26.560 --> 26:27.870
What?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.790
What if Prince Charles had
been kidnapped by terrorists,

26:31.840 --> 26:37.560
and a swap was offered? They'd
take it. They'd make the swap.

26:39.560 --> 26:44.790
The thing that matters is the
identity of the kidnap victim.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.160
They don't think our
son is important enough.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.000
What do you want me to do?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.600
Go and tell them, Harry.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.840
At six o'clock, our son
will be put to death.

27:02.960 --> 27:07.230
He's our son. There's a rule.

27:07.280 --> 27:11.870
It can be broken. If it's
broken, our son will live.

27:11.920 --> 27:19.040
I want you, for the first time in
your life, to go and make a fuss.

27:22.120 --> 27:23.830
That was base, ma'am.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.190
Just to let you know, ma'am,
your husband left an hour ago.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.750
What? Where to?

27:28.800 --> 27:29.840
He wouldn't say.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.510
Er, Armstrong, would you mind
taking me somewhere else?

27:46.560 --> 27:47.600
Certainly, ma'am.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.800
Tilbrook here. He's landed.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.990
The Gordon Hotel.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.080
Sir.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.280
Move out the way!

28:43.120 --> 28:44.960
Move out the way! Move out the way!

28:46.120 --> 28:47.160
Move out the way!

28:58.760 --> 29:00.230
I can't breathe!

29:03.520 --> 29:05.200
George, do you have the... the...

29:07.040 --> 29:09.080
No? OK.

29:10.120 --> 29:14.830
OK. Wait. I'm going to the
pharmacy. I won't be long.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.920
OK?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.800
~

29:53.640 --> 29:55.920
Hello, I'm here to see Martha Franklin.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.440
Room 271, madam.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.720
Thank you.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.720
Open!

30:34.880 --> 30:38.960
800 words on the hemline of
the miniskirt for The Times!

30:40.520 --> 30:43.990
What can you say in 800 words?

30:44.040 --> 30:48.990
Jean Shrimpton wore a mini-dress
to Ascot and scared the horses?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.830
Mary Quant did or didn't
invent the damn thing?

30:51.880 --> 30:53.400
There's blood on your blouse.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.750
Where do you stand on how
far below the panty line

30:57.800 --> 30:59.600
the mini can safely go?

31:02.360 --> 31:03.550
I don't know.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.720
I don't like my knees.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.200
The blood?

31:10.280 --> 31:11.790
A man.

31:11.840 --> 31:13.600
A protestor, I don't know.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.480
So?

31:21.200 --> 31:22.240
How can I help?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.470
You don't know me?

31:25.520 --> 31:26.560
No.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.160
I'm Captain Martin's wife.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.470
Do you do that at home?

31:37.520 --> 31:38.550
Sorry?

31:38.600 --> 31:40.310
Do you, "Pass the sugar, Captain Martin?"

31:40.360 --> 31:42.830
- "Oh, certainly, Mrs Martin."
- What's the matter?

31:42.880 --> 31:44.070
Huh?

31:44.120 --> 31:45.990
It feels like you're...

31:46.040 --> 31:49.120
You're jumping all over me. You
don't know anything about me.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.280
I expect it's the same for
Joe, isn't it, when he's here?

31:55.920 --> 31:57.000
So this is not a...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.040
.. friendly visit.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.510
I don't know. I...

32:02.560 --> 32:03.600
I love him.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.440
You do, don't you?

32:09.000 --> 32:11.190
Have you ever been in love?

32:11.240 --> 32:13.520
Often. All the time.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.920
No.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.600
Men love you.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.920
Often, all the time.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.440
I suppose they do.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.320
Is that enough?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.480
I don't suppose it is.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.840
(How can they help themselves?)

32:43.920 --> 32:45.230
He hasn't.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.710
Joe, Captain Martin, has never...

32:48.760 --> 32:50.110
You wouldn't...

32:50.160 --> 32:52.200
You wouldn't lie to me?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.160
How could anyone lie to you?

33:00.040 --> 33:01.080
How old are you?

33:03.200 --> 33:04.240
21.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.000
How old are you?

33:16.960 --> 33:20.310
Oh. Hello, Harvey. What
are you doing here?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.710
I'm having a chin-wag with a journalist.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.750
Setting her straight on a few things.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.590
American journalist, Martha Franklin.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.190
Just now?

33:30.240 --> 33:34.510
Yes. I wouldn't go near her, if
I was you. She does bad things.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.110
And why are you here, Honour
Martin? All on your own here?

33:38.160 --> 33:40.350
I... We didn't have a honeymoon,

33:40.400 --> 33:42.840
so I thought we could spend
a night in The Gordon.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.350
A bit dear.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.790
Yes.

33:46.840 --> 33:47.920
Yes, I didn't know.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.200
I do now.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.300
~

35:21.800 --> 35:23.080
Royal Military Police.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.390
What was all that about?

35:42.440 --> 35:46.270
Pharmacist in Crater on the
Aden Road. Bit odd, actually.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.560
Why?

35:49.200 --> 35:51.400
Does George Markham want a second inhaler?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.670
What?

35:55.720 --> 35:56.760
What?

35:58.240 --> 35:59.280
What?

36:16.760 --> 36:19.070
Look, I think it's where
they are. I think she

36:19.120 --> 36:22.990
left this at the pharmacy so
we know where their location is.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.760
It could be. We need to be careful.

36:26.720 --> 36:28.350
It could be a trap.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.670
But it's not. It's not, it's
Yusra. She's not like that.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.430
- She loves George. - I'm not sure
we can take that risk, Armstrong.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.190
- Captain Martin?
- Sir?

36:35.240 --> 36:37.190
I've another driving
job for you, I'm afraid.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.430
- But keep it low key, would you?
- Who is it, sir?

36:39.480 --> 36:40.560
It's...

36:42.320 --> 36:43.360
It's Kadir.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.710
Starfish.

36:45.760 --> 36:48.950
You're to take him to a
secure location on the coast.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.310
Intelligence suggests there
may be a rescue attempt,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.120
so to be safe, take a man with you.

36:55.880 --> 36:56.920
Sir.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.480
He treats us like we're his guests.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.950
Two more seconds of him
looking at me like that,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.710
I'd have broke his neck.

37:56.760 --> 37:59.760
Timing, one of his many qualities.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.720
You sound like you admire him.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.760
Yes, I do.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.590
I hate him with all my heart.

38:07.640 --> 38:09.910
But I recognise a worthy adversary, Harry.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.720
If I didn't, I wouldn't have my job.

38:15.320 --> 38:18.670
Mary was wondering whether
you had any children.

38:18.720 --> 38:21.710
I realised, I didn't know.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.390
One of each.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.320
- Have they been out?
- Their mother doesn't like the heat.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.870
I want you to re-consider, Harvey.

38:38.920 --> 38:39.960
Course you do.

38:42.320 --> 38:46.720
I was a year older than George
when I went to boarding school.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.790
My father dropped me off on the first day.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.880
Seven years old.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.200
A week later, towards the end of
the day, he came back for a visit.

39:00.240 --> 39:03.150
And they'd already
started beating out of me

39:03.200 --> 39:05.280
whatever it is they saw they didn't like.

39:07.080 --> 39:11.240
When he came back that day,
I was playing football.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.470
Just a kick-about.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.040
He stood there and watched.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.720
I wanted my father to go away.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.150
I couldn't bear the thought of
having to go through it all again.

39:27.200 --> 39:29.160
I didn't want to stop playing the game.

39:31.520 --> 39:33.840
I was rejecting him...

39:36.120 --> 39:38.350
.. so I could get on with
forgetting about him.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.750
That was the lesson.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.760
- You had to grow up fast.
- Yeah.

39:45.880 --> 39:51.520
But I promised myself,
when George was born...

39:55.280 --> 39:58.320
I've never told anyone
this, not even Mary...

40:00.480 --> 40:03.240
.. that I would never leave him...

40:05.520 --> 40:10.070
.. with that absolute and
desolate feeling of being alone

40:10.120 --> 40:12.470
in a place where nobody loves you.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.070
And you're not.

40:14.120 --> 40:18.590
As a father, you have done -- are
doing -- everything you possibly can.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.680
I respect that.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.400
Which is why it's right
that you came to see me.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.280
And it's why it's the hardest
thing I've ever done...

40:30.280 --> 40:31.320
.. in my life...

40:33.200 --> 40:34.990
.. to say no to you.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.470
Harvey, I can't go back to
Mary and tell her I've failed.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.560
Yes, you can.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.480
Yes, you will.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.760
It's straight on for the coast, sir.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.280
And left for Al-Hinna Farmhouse.

41:24.920 --> 41:25.960
George.

42:05.040 --> 42:08.080
I don't want you to have anything
to do with this, Armstrong.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.110
Sir, I...

42:10.160 --> 42:13.480
- Nobody need know you were involved in any way.
- I'm coming with you.

42:17.280 --> 42:21.070
- The penalty for allowing...
- You won't pull this off without me.

42:21.120 --> 42:22.630
With two of us, we stand half a chance.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.960
It's not a job for one man.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.880
You love her, don't you?

42:33.320 --> 42:34.360
Sir, yes, sir.

43:17.480 --> 43:19.270
He's not here.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.560
Kadir left an hour ago.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.800
If he's not with you,
where the hell is he?

44:24.800 --> 44:27.000
~

44:49.760 --> 44:50.800
Tony.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.800
~

45:08.280 --> 45:10.440
How do we know you have our leader, Kadir?

45:12.320 --> 45:13.800
~

45:22.400 --> 45:24.470
~

45:24.520 --> 45:26.350
How do we know he's alive?

45:26.400 --> 45:30.110
Because if he's not, we have
nothing to exchange for George.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.560
~

45:39.320 --> 45:41.400
How did you know we were here?

45:48.560 --> 45:49.600
Kadir told us.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.640
He seems to know everything.

46:08.280 --> 46:09.600
OK, OK.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.800
One more thing.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.280
Yusra comes with George.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.880
No.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.270
Please, take George. Leave me.

46:30.320 --> 46:34.550
One woman and a child in
exchange for your great leader.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.400
Is he not worth this?

46:40.320 --> 46:41.360
Tell them.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.760
Tell them!

46:57.480 --> 46:58.520
OK.

47:10.600 --> 47:11.910
What is happening?

47:11.960 --> 47:13.120
We're giving you back.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.280
I see.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.160
It doesn't matter.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.520
Do you have my glasses?

48:41.400 --> 48:42.480
It's OK.

48:57.080 --> 48:58.120
- Sir.
- Sir.

49:24.680 --> 49:25.880
Why's he stopped?

49:27.960 --> 49:29.150
Don't know.

49:29.200 --> 49:31.030
George...

49:31.080 --> 49:33.630
walk around it. OK?

49:33.680 --> 49:35.840
Hold my hand, walk slowly.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.510
Come on. Come on, George, come on.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.000
Yes, yes, George.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.160
You did it. OK, let's go!

49:45.520 --> 49:46.830
Come on, let's go.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.360
Go, come, come!

49:50.560 --> 49:52.840
~

52:09.240 --> 52:11.430
'.. second time around,
and this time we know

52:11.480 --> 52:15.150
for a fact that he's safe at
home to hear his favourite song.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.630
- So stand up, everyone, join in...
- George.

52:17.680 --> 52:20.230
- Listen. - .. sing along with
Michael Flanders, Donald Swann,

54:17.600 --> 54:18.910
What do you suggest we do?

54:18.960 --> 54:20.640
- Look after her.
- How?

54:21.840 --> 54:25.870
Erm, protect her, something.
Look, the NLF know what she did.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.310
- Does she have family?
- Yeah.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.830
And do they know where they live?

54:30.880 --> 54:31.910
Yes, sir.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.190
Well, we can't really
bring the whole family

54:34.240 --> 54:37.150
into our care now, can we? Excuse me.

54:37.200 --> 54:38.720
Well, then they'll kill them.
