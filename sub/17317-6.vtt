00:14.720 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, Boris Johnson is the mayor-
in our reasonably priced car. Yeah!

00:19.600 --> 00:22.880
Jeremy attempts an old-fashioned
sensible road-test of
the new Ford Fiesta.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.080
And has Communism ever
produced a good car?

00:35.960 --> 00:38.680
Hello! Hello. And welcome.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.840
Thank you. We start with this
phenomenal new Caterham

00:45.160 --> 00:47.520
that is actually too small
for Jeremy to fit in.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.680
Happily, I fit in it perfectly,
which is why I have been driving it.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.320
And here it comes now.

00:57.680 --> 00:59.080
And there it goes.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.880
and it likes to go this quickly
all the time.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.560
Ye gods! This is something else!

01:12.680 --> 01:14.960
It moves with the agility of a flea.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.000
Every little input through the
steering, the brakes, the throttle,

01:19.840 --> 01:21.400
you get a result every time.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.280
The figures that go with this
little thing are off the scale.

01:29.720 --> 01:32.120
0-60, 2.9 seconds.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.520
Power to weight,
520 horsepower per tonne.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.480
That's the same as a Bugatti Veyron.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.200
If you define driving excitement
as just raw, pure adrenalin then...

01:46.040 --> 01:47.240
well, this is it.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.480
And I'm really glad
I'm driving it on our track.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.200
But not for the
reason you might think.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.880
No, the reason I'm glad to be here
is that no-one can see me.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.640
Allow me to explain. This is the To-
Gear Excellence/Embarrassment graph,

02:06.040 --> 02:09.759
and it measures how good the car
is to drive against how
embarrassing it is to be seen in.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.280
Some examples - the Alfa Romeo
Spider is a pretty shonky thing to
drive

02:14.760 --> 02:16.320
but very cool to be seen in,

02:16.800 --> 02:18.840
so it sits about here on our graph.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.040
The Audi RS4 is undeniably
very, very good to drive,

02:22.960 --> 02:24.760
but driven exclusively by cocks,

02:25.960 --> 02:28.800
so pretty embarrassing to be
seen in - it ends up about here.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.480
Last example, Citroen Pluriel -
well, that's terrible to drive

02:33.720 --> 02:37.400
and really very embarrassing to be
seen in, so it sits right up here.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.960
Finally,
the Caterham R500 Superlight.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.880
Well, there's no denying it is
absolutely brilliant to drive,

02:46.040 --> 02:48.840
but also catastrophically
embarrassing to be seen in,

02:50.160 --> 02:51.680
because it's driven only
by geeks and nerds,

02:52.680 --> 02:54.520
so it ends up well in
the problem area of the graph...

02:55.280 --> 02:56.560
up here.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.160
What we need then, really, is a
Caterham that's OK to be seen in.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.480
And this could be a contender.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.680
It's called the Veritas RSIII,

03:18.560 --> 03:20.280
and there's certainly no problem
with its appearance,

03:21.080 --> 03:25.240
because it looks like a
1930s racing car from the future.

03:29.320 --> 03:33.440
Now, you've probably never heard
of the Veritas, and that
usually only means two things.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.680
Firstly,
it's built by a man in a shed.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.360
Secondly, that man's wife
will leave him

03:40.120 --> 03:41.640
when the bank manager forces him
to sell the house

03:42.600 --> 03:44.360
to pay for his fibreglass lash-up.

03:46.920 --> 03:51.200
However, the Veritas is German
and, annoyingly, German shed cars

03:51.920 --> 03:54.640
can be as good as most other
people's factory cars.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.200
This incredible body is hand-crafte-
from carbon fibre and Kevlar
with precision -

04:01.840 --> 04:03.920
and that's German precision,
remember, which is the best sort.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.440
Then there's the engine,
which is a V8 from BMW's M division.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.680
Now, the M division don't sell
their engines to cowboys or losers,

04:16.040 --> 04:19.240
so the Veritas has got a
good job reference right there.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.200
And what this also means is that th-
Veritas is pretty quick.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.720
Woah! Where have I felt that
before?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.000
Oh, yeah, in that Caterham
about five minutes ago.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.320
This V8 once powered the BMW M3

04:39.200 --> 04:43.600
but has been tuned up from 420
to 473 horsepower.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.680
0-60, 3.6 seconds.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.240
Every time you stamp on the
throttle,

04:54.120 --> 04:56.120
this thing just drop-kicks your
stomach half a mile
back down the road.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.600
ENGINE REVS

05:03.040 --> 05:05.200
The reason for this
speed isn't just power.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.480
It's also down to weight -
or rather lack of it.

05:11.240 --> 05:15.280
The Veritas only weighs a snatch
over 1,000 kilos, but then it would,

05:16.640 --> 05:19.600
because you don't get ABS, traction-
control or a windscreen,

05:20.680 --> 05:24.120
and there's no roof,
just a sort of submarine hatch
covering the passenger seat.

05:24.120 --> 05:28.400
But this absence of anything
does come at quite a price -

05:31.040 --> 05:35.600
£246,948, to be exact.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.000
But you do get this glorious
speedboat-style wooden flooring

05:41.960 --> 05:45.000
and these hand-milled
bespoke switches

05:45.760 --> 05:48.360
and, well, couple that with the
fact that, in the jet set,

05:49.080 --> 05:51.680
there's generally one born every
minute, and it all sort
of makes sense, really.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.120
At least what the Veritas lacks
in toys or value for money

05:59.240 --> 06:05.640
it does make up for in history -
because, many decades ago, Veritas
was a German sports car company

06:07.120 --> 06:10.280
and they made the very first
German Formula One car.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.920
Which means, if I apply some
Top Gear logic, this thing
should be good through the corners.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.400
TYRES SCREECH

06:28.880 --> 06:33.160
In fact, it's nowhere near as
sharp as the dweeby Caterham.

06:34.840 --> 06:39.480
The biggest problem by a country
mile is the big round thing
in front of me.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.200
appears to have been taken
from a lorry.

06:46.640 --> 06:51.960
I mean, look, I have to keep
turning, keep turning, take my
hands off and do some more turning.

06:59.960 --> 07:04.200
Now, Veritas say they
won't be selling cars to
customers until next year,

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
and that by then the steering will
have been sorted out but, even if
it is, this won't be the car for me.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.400
It's just too serious.
The price is too serious.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.120
The engine, Kevlar...

07:20.200 --> 07:22.200
I want my Caterham back.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.040
I want my fun back.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.480
APPLAUSE

07:32.680 --> 07:34.120
Very good, but Hammond... Yes.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.240
..I'm slightly perplexed.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.040
You say if you drive around in
one of these you look a dweeb.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.040
Yes. You know Jeremy's wife's got
one of these? Ah... Very
fond of it, big fan.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.600
She's here today. All right...
She wants a word with you.
Thank you(!)

07:49.760 --> 07:52.560
Anyway, if you drive one of
these and you look a dweeb,
how do you think you look in that?

07:54.160 --> 07:55.880
Emeritus Professor of History?
LAUGHTER

07:56.960 --> 07:58.480
Edward Fox, perhaps?

07:59.440 --> 08:00.840
Or a big, slobbering...

08:02.440 --> 08:05.640
No, no. The thing is, this costs
£212,000 more than the Caterham.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.840
Exactly, so you're paying a
lot more for a car that's worse.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.760
Well, to find that out, we'll have
to see how fast they go
round our track,

08:14.120 --> 08:15.760
and for that we need
our tame racing driver.

08:18.560 --> 08:18.840
Some say one of his legs gets
longer when he sees
a pretty lady.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.000
LAUGHTER

08:24.760 --> 08:27.680
And that I haven't done one of
these for some time and I've
forgotten to make up a second thing.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.640
LAUGHTER

08:32.679 --> 08:34.240
All we know is he's called The Stig.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.440
And he's off!

08:38.799 --> 08:42.480
Lots of wheel-spin off the line but-
then it digs in and unleashes the
full force of that four-litre V8.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.960
Powers down towards the first
corner.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.200
Turns in rather gingerly,
it must be said.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.280
I should add, since I drove
the car, Veritas have given it

08:51.040 --> 08:53.520
a faster steering rack, which
should make it easier
to drive quickly.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.480
Stig suddenly having
no problems at Chicago.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.160
Down to Hammerhead now,
hard on the brakes.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.600
Turns it in. Seemed to scrub off
quite a bit of speed there.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.920
But he's right back on it now,
kicking the tail out on the exit.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.760
Let's see him really wind
it up for the follow-through.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.200
Here he goes.

09:18.560 --> 09:20.400
Doesn't actually
sound like a V8 there.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.920
Just two corners left.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.000
Going into the penultimate corner.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.240
Very smooth. Just Gambon left.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.640
Very composed into there,

09:32.280 --> 09:34.040
just a little flick of opposite
lock, and across the line.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.160
APPLAUSE

09:41.520 --> 09:43.720
And it...
A big V8 in there, powerful car.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.120
So let's have a look. It did it
in 1.24.02,

09:48.720 --> 09:51.240
which is faster than an Audi R8.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.520
That's a quick time.
Well done, Veritas.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.840
Now we must find out if
the Caterham
can do any better.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.960
Off it goes again,
and let's just see how quickly the
Caterham gets off the line.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.480
It is like a little flea,
this thing.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
Piles it into the first corner,
locking up the brakes.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.920
Like the Veritas, the R500 has got
no ABS or other electronic nonsense.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.240
Beautiful drift
through the other side.

10:13.360 --> 10:17.280
Just sliding it around Chicago.
That is how
this car should be driven.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.480
Hammerhead now. Stig is so excited
he's flipped on the indicator.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.960
He's rarely had so
much fun out here.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.320
You really notice that bump on
Hammerhead in a car as light as
this.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.120
Only problem is that lack of
weight can make it hard to
get heated with the tyres on.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.120
This is a very cold day, remember.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.560
That two-litre Ford engine,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.680
half the cylinders and capacity of
the Veritas but, by God, it flies.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.520
Neat through the penultimate corner.
Stig really on it now,
loving every minute.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.120
Slings it through Gambon,
and across the line.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.040
APPLAUSE

10:49.000 --> 10:52.800
Obviously, the big question is,
did it go faster than the Veritas?

10:53.880 --> 10:59.120
In fact, it did go faster -
quite a bit faster, quite
a lot faster, actually.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.600
Quite a heck of a lot
faster, because it's up here!

11:02.440 --> 11:05.160
1.17.9. Look at that!

11:06.600 --> 11:09.440
1.17.9! Nearly as fast
as a Zonda F Convertible!

11:10.640 --> 11:12.400
That means the £36,000 Caterham

11:13.160 --> 11:15.400
is faster than a £1 million
Bugatti Veyron. I just...!

11:16.360 --> 11:17.520
APPLAUSE

11:18.560 --> 11:19.760
An amazing little car!

11:21.040 --> 11:22.360
Absolutely fabulous.

11:22.960 --> 11:24.520
And now the news,

11:25.240 --> 11:27.120
and it's great news,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.840
It's news to warm
the hearts of nations.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.120
Jeremy Clarkson has lost his voice.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

11:37.840 --> 11:41.280
Mate, I'm sorry. I know!
Imagine how we feel!

11:44.400 --> 11:45.920
They're gutted, mate.
They're gutted.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.480
But the good news is that means
we can talk about whatever we
like and say what we like.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.840
So, let's...
LAUGHTER

11:54.360 --> 11:55.440
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.800
Let's get on with the news. I
thought we'd start this week

11:58.400 --> 12:00.680
with talking about this
magazine called Heat.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.360
Ooh, yeah?
LAUGHTER

12:04.000 --> 12:07.680
Every year, they do a survey in
which they ask the whole world

12:08.880 --> 12:10.760
to tell them their sort of
weirdest crush,

12:13.080 --> 12:17.320
their strangest, freakiest,
oddest, most embarrassing,
ridiculous person to fancy.

12:19.240 --> 12:20.680
And, well, do you wanna guess?

12:22.080 --> 12:24.480
He's won it, ladies and gentlemen!

12:25.320 --> 12:27.440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Here he is! Look at that!

12:28.880 --> 12:31.240
Yeah! "Number one weird crush."

12:33.520 --> 12:36.000
And the other thing, ladies and
gentlemen, in the same magazine...

12:38.080 --> 12:39.920
This is actually quite poetic,
in the romance.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.920
He's in the same magazine as his
boyfriend, look! Aw! Will Young.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.680
And he loves him so much.
Jeremy, I'm really pleased that
you should share magazine space

12:51.920 --> 12:54.600
with Will Young, your boyfriend.
You know what he did the other
day, when he still had his voice?

12:55.880 --> 12:59.120
He came into the office and went,
"Have you heard Will's new single?
It's fantastic!" He loves it.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.440
"Will"! He went on about it all the
time. "I love Bill's new song."
He does.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
Can I just say... Oh, it speaks!

13:07.600 --> 13:08.760
Or sort of squeaks.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.920
Yeah, no... That's just a noise.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.760
Are you deflating? What's that?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.040
Synthetic saliva?!

13:21.880 --> 13:24.360
It means that I have
just a few minutes of speaking. Oh!

13:25.560 --> 13:27.200
So you need more saliva?

13:28.920 --> 13:30.680
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I've
no doubt we can oblige with that.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.560
LAUGHTER

13:33.160 --> 13:35.280
How do you know it's synthetic
and isn't just some bloke's...?

13:36.240 --> 13:37.040
LAUGHTER

13:38.120 --> 13:39.520
Gobbing...
HE MIMICS SPITTING

13:40.120 --> 13:41.080
Bottle it.

13:41.680 --> 13:42.800
You can shut up for a
kick-off as well.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.520
What is that noise you're making?

13:45.240 --> 13:49.360
Have you seen his eye?
He's got the biggest eye
infection I've ever seen!

13:51.080 --> 13:52.320
At least I don't look like a
mutant!

13:56.320 --> 13:57.680
Has it come to this?
I'm working with these two.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.600
This isn't a television
programme any more. It's a colony!

14:01.160 --> 14:02.320
LAUGHTER

14:03.520 --> 14:05.160
I tell you what, instead of
hurling abuse at each other, why...

14:06.280 --> 14:07.520
Excuse me. Why don't we do the
news?

14:09.000 --> 14:09.920
Yes, let's do the news.
Good news, OK?

14:12.320 --> 14:16.120
We haven't been asked to do
the commentary on the Formula One
coverage on the BBC next year.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.480
No, it's good news.
What they've got, they've brought
Martin Brundle over from ITV.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.440
That's fantastic. We'll be able
to watch the slow march of
his trousers up his stomach.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.000
LAUGHTER
They've got Eddie Jordan.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.320
He's gonna be a pundit. That's
fantastic. Eddie's a great guy.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.920
David Coulthard is the other
pundit, and that worries me.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.960
I think that means that on
lap two of every race your
telly will suddenly go off.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.800
Or it'll just fall off the stand
for no reason.
"Why have you done that?"

14:47.640 --> 14:50.440
Apparently, they've got Murray
Walker involved. They have. Murray
Walker's coming back to the BBC.

14:51.280 --> 14:52.560
He is. Yeah.
AUDIENCE CHEERS

14:55.320 --> 14:56.360
Bless him. It is good news.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.080
Did you know, though, he's 84?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.160
He'll be at Silverstone going, "It
were all trees when I were a lad."

15:03.760 --> 15:05.160
Ferrari's pulled in
with their first pit stop.
Let's go to Murray Walker.

15:05.880 --> 15:08.000
"Can someone change me bag?
It's full again."

15:10.320 --> 15:12.880
commentating
on F1, that's pretty cool.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.880
You won't be commentating on
anything. Look! I've just thought.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.560
I wanna move it on. You know the
Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson?

15:21.880 --> 15:23.640
She recently sold her Jaguar.
It has ended up in the hands of -

15:26.640 --> 15:28.040
it was in the papers this week -
hands of a cabbie.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.080
Steve Coulson, 31,
of the north somewhere.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.440
He's gone to the papers

15:35.520 --> 15:36.920
because he found that she's left
all the addresses she's been to

15:37.680 --> 15:39.440
in the sat nav,
still programmed into the system.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.120
He is saying,
"What if I'd been a terrorist?

15:44.080 --> 15:45.960
"This car is a suicide
bomber's dream."

15:48.280 --> 15:49.760
Now one of the addresses in there,
Windsor Castle.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.720
Another, Buckingham Palace.
LAUGHTER

15:54.840 --> 15:57.160
I think some people know
where those things are already.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.200
No, don't laugh, this is a
national security nightmare, it is.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.280
And also, he has inadvertently made-
himself the world's most hunted man.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.240
I'm presuming he's looked at this
sat nav and seen the addresses.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.200
He knows where Windsor Castle is.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.440
Every terrorist organisation in
the world is going to be after him

16:15.160 --> 16:16.760
for his lethal secret knowledge.
LAUGHTER

16:18.480 --> 16:20.000
I think there's only one decent
course of action here. What?

16:21.240 --> 16:23.800
Assuming he has destroyed it,
that's fine. He has read it,

16:25.640 --> 16:27.480
therefore he must kill himself
and take his knowledge to the grave.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.560
Now, there's a new Mini convertible.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.560
It's got better engines,
bigger boot.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.440
But the thing that caught my eye is-
it's fitted with something called

16:36.080 --> 16:37.920
an "openometer".
I'm not making this up.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.160
An openometer tells you
how much you
have driven it with the roof off.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.880
Well, what's the point in that?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.880
Why not have a dial that
tells you how many times you've
driven through Leicester?

16:50.560 --> 16:52.440
Why would you want to know what you-
drove with the roof up,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.840
and what you drove with the
roof down? It makes no sense.

16:56.120 --> 16:57.800
Do you remember the early Corvettes,

16:58.680 --> 17:02.800
they had a little dial that showed
you how many revs the engine had
done. Revs? Revs, yeah.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.520
What, going around at 5,000 rpm?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.800
It would be wider than the car
just to get the dial in.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.240
I worked it out from
my old Porsche actually. Your what?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.200
My old Porsche is 25 years old.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.760
8.4 times 10 to the eight revs.
You worked that out...

17:22.680 --> 17:24.599
LAUGHTER
..for your car? You've spent time...

17:25.839 --> 17:30.320
Wow, so you must actually have done-
everything there is to do
in the whole world

17:31.440 --> 17:34.520
to get to the bottom of the list
of everything a human being can do.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.600
What's it like on the top of
Everest? It's all right.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.560
Richard, I went to
a dinner party the other day.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.640
I was sat next to a girl who said
she couldn't believe James May
was still single.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.320
There's your answer!
There's your answer!

17:48.520 --> 17:50.520
Anyway, look, tough times
for carmakers, as we know.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.160
They're all in really, really
deep...

17:54.720 --> 17:58.640
Oh, dear, I've arrived at a point
where I can't say the word
I need to say - deep mess.

18:00.600 --> 18:03.880
They've resorted to offering
incredibly long test drives

18:04.640 --> 18:06.400
to people just to
get them into the showrooms.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.680
Lexus will lend you a car
for 48 hours - two days.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.800
BMW say you can go in one
of their cars for 100 miles.

18:13.640 --> 18:16.000
Peugeot, 24 hours. Peugeot? Peugeot.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.440
Are they surprised when people
bring it back after 24 minutes?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.240
That's enough of that!
Now the reporter who uncovered

18:23.880 --> 18:26.680
this story, he said he went to a
Peugeot dealership to try a 207.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.400
And the salesman said,
"I can go one better than that, sir.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.880
"I can lend you a 4007."

18:33.840 --> 18:35.240
That's not ONE better, is it?

18:36.320 --> 18:39.040
That's 3,800 better he went,
just to try and get a sale.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.200
One better than a 207 is...

18:41.640 --> 18:43.440
work it out. It's...

18:44.040 --> 18:45.560
it's herpes. Yeah.
LAUGHTER

18:46.040 --> 18:47.200
Think about this logically.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.440
How many people here drove to the
studio today?

18:50.240 --> 18:53.160
Everybody? In my Peugeot.
Brilliant car. Best in the world.
What's a brilliant car?

18:53.760 --> 18:56.360
Peugeot 406 with a six-player CD.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.240
Best car in the world.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.880
That's you told!

19:02.440 --> 19:04.440
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
He's making a fine case for it.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.720
He thinks the Peugeot 406,
with a six-player CD,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.400
is the best car in the world.
Not an Enzo, as it turns out.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.400
We've been wasting our time.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.440
I'm glad you brought that up,
because I'm going to
skip on down, if I may.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.000
The number of lunatics in Britain
has been halved.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.800
I know there's some evidence to
suggest that they're out and in
the countryside and among us.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.800
But I have arrived at
this conclusion

19:36.560 --> 19:38.800
by a simple and alarming fact
that came across my desk
only this morning.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.000
Electric car sales are down by half.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.040
That must mean that loonies
are fewer and far between.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.200
Really, I genuinely
congratulate you for your bravery.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.840
It seems these days that absolutely
everything you buy is made in China.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.080
Chopsticks,
Ming vases, mah jong sets...

19:58.680 --> 20:00.200
Dogs. Exactly.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.160
Some people are saying that
soon we will be buying cars
made in the People's Republic.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.080
Thing is, though,
China is a Communist country.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.360
And that got James and me wondering.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.240
Communism - has it ever produced
a good car?

20:17.040 --> 20:20.800
We thought it would ironic to
film our hunt here
at the Greenham Common airbase,

20:23.160 --> 20:29.360
home in the 1980s
to 96 US Air Force missiles
and several hundred lesbians.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.760
Today they're all gone,
and in their place we find this.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.880
It's a Lada Riva, which started
out in life as a Fiat 124,

20:43.360 --> 20:45.560
one of the most advanced
sports saloons of the period.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.480
But the Russians made a few changes-
to the original design.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.240
They replaced the excellent disc
brakes with drums, which were worse.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.720
They fitted a starting handle,

21:01.600 --> 21:05.000
a manual fuel pump,
and they made the body
from much, much thicker steel.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.280
As I shall now demonstrate...

21:08.840 --> 21:10.240
..with my hammer. Ready?

21:15.280 --> 21:16.440
It's nuclear.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.200
The heaviest part of the car,
though, was not the nuclear
bunker bodywork.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.040
It was the steering.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.160
I actually believe
it's set in concrete.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.720
In fact, the only good thing
about this car is that
you could drive it in a hat.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.640
Let me give you
an example of its terribleness.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.440
The rear brakes were
made from aluminium.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.560
They must have thought,
"Aha, that's very advanced!

21:45.040 --> 21:46.560
"The West hasn't thought of this."

21:47.560 --> 21:48.560
There's a very good
reason for that though.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.840
Aluminium has the same braking
properties, really, as...cheese.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.000
TYRES SCREECH

22:01.960 --> 22:03.240
Despite all these things,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.320
the Riva is still being built today-
under licence in Egypt.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.080
Imagine that,
a 40-year-old Italian design,

22:12.080 --> 22:15.760
improved by the Russians and
now built by a bunch of Egyptians.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.720
I can't think of
anything worse than that!

22:25.200 --> 22:26.600
Well, I can.

22:28.040 --> 22:31.520
You see, the Lada was not the only
car to come from the Soviet Union.

22:32.840 --> 22:33.880
There were hundreds of
the damn things -

22:34.840 --> 22:36.240
GAZes, VAZes,

22:37.560 --> 22:40.160
ZILs, ISHes, ZAZes...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.840
..and this, the Moskvitch 408.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.680
Now this car was originally launched-
at the 1964 British
Earl's Court Motor Show.

22:52.640 --> 22:56.400
And it was Communism's response
to our very own people's car,
the Mark I Cortina.

22:57.880 --> 23:03.000
And as you'd expect, the Moskvitch
was very cheap. Just £679.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.760
The Cortina was a whole pound
more expensive.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.000
The gearbox is sloppy,
the suspension is bouncy,

23:13.880 --> 23:16.840
the steering is very heavy
and yet very vague.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.400
And just listen to the noise
when you hit 40?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.920
ENGINE SHUDDERS

23:26.040 --> 23:28.760
Interestingly, this particular one
was built in the factory
where they also made

23:29.480 --> 23:31.480
the AK47 rifle.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.800
The difference is,
this is much more lethal.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.720
So, whose car was the most wretched?

23:41.400 --> 23:43.640
That is simply the worst car in
the world. Even worse than this.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.000
Disagree.
Have you seen the pedals in this?

23:47.120 --> 23:49.960
Look where the accelerator pedal is-
in relation to the other two.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.560
Thought so. A rev counter. Yes?

23:53.400 --> 23:54.720
You decadent, capitalist pig!

23:55.400 --> 23:56.760
Ownership of a rev counter is theft.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.520
This is the colour
of a prosthetic limb.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.880
You've got wipers on your headlights.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.240
They don't work! Not the point.
It's aspirational.

24:07.320 --> 24:10.120
Rear suspension made out of cart
springs. What have you got on yours?-
Coils. Exactly.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.920
Elitist! The coils, James,
are from a Bulgarian's biro.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.960
We decided to settle our argument

24:19.960 --> 24:22.800
by finding out which was
the slowest
in a quarter-mile drag race.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.160
And, to spice it up, we would be
racing against a Western car
from the time,

24:28.760 --> 24:34.520
a Ford Cortina 1600 E, and a dog.

24:39.560 --> 24:40.600
Fast as you can. Don't cheat.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.720
Why would I need to cheat?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.040
Er... Launch control?

24:46.760 --> 24:48.200
No, doesn't have that. Er...

25:10.320 --> 25:12.560
Clearly,
the Commie cars would be a while.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.520
So let's move on - to this...

25:18.080 --> 25:19.800
..the Zzzgggz 968.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.400
Maybe this could save the day
for Socialism.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.960
Oh, my God, there's no key!

25:29.280 --> 25:30.760
ENGINE STARTS

25:31.400 --> 25:32.480
Yeah!

25:37.920 --> 25:42.520
Interestingly it was
rear-engined, so it was exactly
the same as a Porsche 911...

25:44.320 --> 25:45.720
..except for one thing.

25:47.320 --> 25:53.120
Look at this. Under the carpet in
here, the passenger foot-well,
there's a little flap.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.200
You open it and there's a hole.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.920
The idea is that you park your car
on a frozen lake,
cut a hole in the ice,

26:00.320 --> 26:05.760
drop your fishing line
through the hole, plug in your
interior lamp, like that.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.320
Then you hang that up,
and you can sit back and
do an evening's fishing.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.680
Not even a Maybach has this!

26:18.720 --> 26:22.480
Better still, the Zappo 968
was available with a choice of
trim levels.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Unusual in a single party state.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.400
This is the standard 968, OK? Yes.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.240
What do you suppose the 968 B2 was?

26:36.920 --> 26:37.960
It was an estate version. No.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.480
It was for people who had
the use of only one foot. Ah!

26:42.840 --> 26:44.600
968 B?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.280
That's the least of its problems.
968 B? Twin carb?

26:50.520 --> 26:52.480
No. For people who didn't
have the use of either foot.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.720
968 A?

26:56.280 --> 26:57.720
People with...

26:59.160 --> 27:03.080
..one foot and two hands but
one of them is frozen?

27:04.760 --> 27:06.880
No. That was the one
with the 0.7 litre engine. Wow!

27:11.600 --> 27:13.720
Now, if you're name begins with
"Ar" and ends with "thur Scargill",

27:14.720 --> 27:17.800
you might claim we're wrong to blame-
Communism for all these
truly terrible cars.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.920
You might say that it's just
a Russian problem,

27:28.480 --> 27:32.480
Well, Mr Scargill, a quick canter
through some other Eastern Bloc
cars will prove you wrong.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.680
Take this, the Wartburg,
from East Germany.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.680
When they made a rally version
of this,
they had to fit uprated brakes,

27:42.280 --> 27:44.040
which they got from an Austin Maxi.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.760
How bad do the standard brakes have-
to be for a Maxi's to be better?

27:53.120 --> 27:55.960
And then there was the equally
East German Trabant,

27:57.200 --> 28:00.360
which was made from,
and I'm not making this up...cotton.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.840
Mr Khrushchev once said,
"We will bury you."

28:08.760 --> 28:12.920
What with? This?
It's actually made from leather.

28:13.920 --> 28:18.280
I think it looks like
somebody's crashed a motorcycle
into the back of a cow.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.400
And then from Poland
there's the FSO pick-up truck.

28:26.600 --> 28:30.000
And, of course, we know
a thing or two on Top Gear
about how to test such things.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.080
This free world Toyota, for example.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.400
We dropped it from
a 23-storey tower block.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.760
And it worked afterwards.

28:43.520 --> 28:47.800
So, surely the rugged FSO,
from the world's best plumbers,
could survive this?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.240
'It didn't.'

28:57.640 --> 28:59.360
Maybe we should try dropping
it from a slightly lower height?

29:00.240 --> 29:01.360
It's a bit late now, isn't it?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.760
NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYS

29:07.480 --> 29:09.640
Finally, from Britain,
there was the Morris Marina.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.680
The unpleasant log laid by British
Leyland after Communism crept,

29:16.320 --> 29:17.960
like a Nietzsche red blanket,
over the shop floor.

29:21.440 --> 29:25.040
God almighty. God almighty!

29:26.080 --> 29:27.640
Britain made this.

29:29.480 --> 29:33.080
They have the effrontery,
the bare-faced cheek,
to call this super?

29:34.360 --> 29:38.240
I suppose
you weren't actually allowed back
then to call it Trotskyite crap.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.320
Maybe that's what the
TC version stood for.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.160
Still, having it here enables us
to answer an important question.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.320
You see, the Cold War ended before
we ever got the chance to find out

29:49.840 --> 29:52.160
who would have won
if we'd actually started fighting.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.040
Yeah, but now we can
find out with a race.
We have all the ingredients here.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.000
It's cold,
the track is much too narrow,
it's too pockmarked, it's bumpy.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.240
I shall be driving the Morris
Marxist and you shall be in the...

30:08.040 --> 30:11.200
What is it? The Lenin 1.6 SLX.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.280
Lovely. And the winner gets Berlin.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.240
And the loser
has to sacrifice his bath plug.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
Now we'll see, Mr Clarkson.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.640
Oi!

30:25.920 --> 30:26.240
Welcome to the inaugural round of
the BTCC, The British Touring
Communism Championships.

30:29.400 --> 30:33.400
Welcome to the inaugural round of
the BTCC, The British Touring
Communism Championships.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.000
I can get him on the inside. Yes!

30:38.720 --> 30:43.200
Oh, no, he's coming
through but he has an 86 brake
horse power - I've only got 83.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.800
May! Marvellous.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.000
Russian communism is better
than British communism.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.160
How do you like that?

30:55.200 --> 30:56.640
Come on, get out of my way!

30:58.640 --> 31:01.040
This thing is impossible to steer.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.400
Whoa! I've missed the track.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.640
I'll take him here.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.320
Get off!

31:15.320 --> 31:18.280
No, May, no. I'm back in the lead.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.120
The handling is simply diabolical.
There's no other word for it.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.200
Yes, the Polaris is way
in the lead here.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.200
Gaining. Gaining. No, wait!

31:38.040 --> 31:41.360
The SS18 is coming through.
BUMP

31:42.200 --> 31:43.240
He's hit me. He's hit me.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.920
There's nothing I can do.
Ha! That will annoy him.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.480
There's some catching up
to be done now!

31:56.360 --> 31:57.520
Come on, Marina!

31:59.440 --> 32:00.840
There he is, he's in my sights.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.040
'The Marina caught the Lada
quite quickly,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.080
'which means we would have won the
Cold War if we'd started fighting.'

32:09.640 --> 32:10.720
Yes, what you think of this?!

32:12.840 --> 32:14.480
Argh! Goodbye, Mr May.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.840
Oh, dear.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.560
I seem to have accidentally
killed James May there.

32:22.800 --> 32:28.000
Anyway... The miracle is not
that the Marina won that, it's that-
it was built in the first place.

32:30.760 --> 32:34.080
In Russia, you had to work hard in
the car factories or you'd suddenly

32:34.840 --> 32:40.880
discover how difficult it is to
mine Siberian salt while wearing
a hat made from your wife's head.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.120
British Communists didn't really
bother with any of that.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.240
Mostly, in fact, they didn't
bother turning up for work at all.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.240
They'd simply get to the factory
gates where they'd spent the rest

32:55.480 --> 32:57.320
of the day chatting and huddling
for warmth round a burning dustbin.

33:00.600 --> 33:01.760
It does work well as a brazier.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.120
But that's what they were best
at because they spent

33:04.640 --> 33:07.080
more time with braziers than
they did making cars. It's true.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.080
So far, we've established that
Communistical cars were not fast,

33:13.080 --> 33:15.560
pretty, well engineered,
cheap or reliable.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.960
But while all animals were equal,
some were more equal than others.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.400
This is a GAZ Chaika. They made
just 144 of these every year,

33:30.880 --> 33:33.360
and not one of them ever made
it in the hands of the proletariat.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.560
These were for high-ranking
officials.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.360
Well, ha, you know the KGB
used these?

33:39.960 --> 33:41.200
Except theirs had
more powerful engines.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.960
You should see the amount
of space back here.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.160
You could chop up 30 dissidents
in the back of here.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.800
'But despite all these plus points,
the Chaika isn't a good car.'

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
LOUD CLUNK
Was that a gear change? It was.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.960
Is there a man in the gearbox
with a sledgehammer?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.000
That's what it feels like.
That's unbelievable.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.440
How is the steering - precise?
Yeah... No.

34:13.239 --> 34:15.400
Don't do that. I'm doing 20mph.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.760
How can I shoot you
if I can't sit still?

34:20.400 --> 34:22.280
Top speed? 99mph.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.639
So it can't even do 100? No.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.360
With a 5.5 litre V8?! Quite.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.800
I suspect this is as far
as we go, Mr Clarkson.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.360
You're going to have to turn
it round. That's going to take
the rest of our lives. Oh, BEEP!

34:39.679 --> 34:40.840
It's disappeared into
the bloody dashboard!

34:41.440 --> 34:42.400
THEY LAUGH

34:43.040 --> 34:45.600
I'm going to grab this camera
so you can actually see
what has happened here.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.400
These are the buttons
that change the gears.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.639
That's park, that's backwards
and that was forwards.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
I promise you, I merely pressed it
and my finger just...

34:54.960 --> 34:56.400
THEY LAUGH

34:58.800 --> 35:00.440
'So they couldn't make
a decent luxury car either.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.600
'But one about the other end of
the scale? Rugged simplicity.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.800
'Surely this is good
Commie territory.'

35:10.840 --> 35:11.360
It does seem to have been built
on relatively sensible principles.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.400
It does seem to have been built
on relatively sensible principles.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.400
Add weight and simplify.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.360
'What's more, it had coiled springs

35:29.680 --> 35:31.280
'- not the RSJs
you got in Land Rovers

35:31.920 --> 35:33.680
'of the time - so it
was surprisingly comfortable.'

35:36.000 --> 35:39.160
I once drove one of these down
a very heavily rutted track
at 50mph

35:40.400 --> 35:41.680
and I was able to use
the cigarette lighter

35:42.280 --> 35:45.000
because it was so smooth to light
a cigarette. It was that smooth.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.760
I'd actually quite like to
demonstrate that for you now
but, unfortunately,

35:50.600 --> 35:52.360
we don't live in a free country.

35:58.040 --> 36:01.040
'We ploughed on through the field
and things looked promising.'

36:03.880 --> 36:04.720
'But then...'

36:11.760 --> 36:14.240
Oh, give up. We are in Berkshire
and it's been completely defeated.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.080
If this comes out, I can stand
up like Rommel and guide you.

36:19.160 --> 36:19.960
Argh!

36:20.920 --> 36:21.960
We don't need that. Right.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.960
Forwards, slowly.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.320
Argh, no, no, no, no!

36:32.360 --> 36:35.800
'In the end, we were pulled free by-
a decadent capitalist Land Rover.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.320
'But we were reluctant to give up
on our little Niva.'

36:42.200 --> 36:44.280
And it is quite a rugged,
personable little thing.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.320
It is, actually. It is. It's the
sort of car you can give it a name.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.400
It's got one - Niva.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.720
Do you think we've actually found
the Communist car that we like?

37:02.800 --> 37:03.520
No!

37:04.320 --> 37:05.640
THEY LAUGH

37:06.360 --> 37:07.280
Shall we get the train?

37:13.400 --> 37:14.920
Simple message.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.480
Don't buy a Chinese car until China-
renounces Communisticalness.

37:20.920 --> 37:21.720
You pair of idiots.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.600
Did it, what - slip your mind?

37:24.200 --> 37:25.520
These three cars - Maserati,
Lamborghini, Ferrari.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.200
All three built within 30 miles
of the Italian city Bologna which,

37:30.400 --> 37:34.720
for 50 years and until nine
years ago, was run by
the Italian Communist Party.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.520
Which means that actual Ferrari
was built by Communists.

37:40.600 --> 37:41.960
I'm glad he brought that up

37:43.640 --> 37:47.040
because London used to be
a communist city but now,

37:48.640 --> 37:51.760
thanks to my guest,
it isn't any more.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.600
Ladies and gentlemen, please...
You do this, my voice...

37:55.160 --> 37:56.000
Go, quickly!

37:57.040 --> 37:59.200
Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Johnson!

38:03.840 --> 38:05.280
How are you? Very well. Have a seat.

38:06.920 --> 38:07.760
Thank you, Jeremy.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.200
What's this? Is that for me?

38:12.760 --> 38:14.160
It's my urine sample.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.560
I'm very startled. What's that?

38:18.480 --> 38:20.360
How can you be a journalist
and politician and still be loved?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.720
Most people still love Boris!

38:25.240 --> 38:27.240
I resent... I think I'd resist
your analysis there.

38:30.160 --> 38:34.160
What you find is that people
are far from loving - shout all
sorts of hostile things. Who shouts

38:35.400 --> 38:37.640
I was watching your programme
and someone was saying

38:38.480 --> 38:40.880
I was a faffing around in trying
to remove the bendy buses.

38:42.520 --> 38:43.800
Let's get straight... Yeah,
let's get straight to it.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.360
How long have you been mayor
of London for? Eight months.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.320
You said before you were mayor,
"I will get rid of the bendy
buses."

38:52.080 --> 38:53.800
And I will. This Friday...
Burn them.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.320
..I am told that we are
announcing the removal of

38:59.080 --> 39:01.560
the bendy bus from
three routes, 80 buses.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.480
You are talking
but I'm hearing music!

39:06.160 --> 39:07.600
When's this happening?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.440
They will be off by 2010.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.040
For God's sake!
You are a very hard man to please.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.160
A very hard man!

39:18.720 --> 39:19.960
Anybody would think you were some
kind of crazed petrolhead.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.480
LAUGHTER

39:24.360 --> 39:25.280
I'm looking at what you've done,
or your initiatives, since you came

39:26.160 --> 39:28.880
in here and it is extraordinary how-
I disagree with almost all of them.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.440
LAUGHTER
Like not drinking on the tube.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.440
I'm 48 years old and if I want
a refreshing pint on the tube...

39:40.000 --> 39:42.480
A 44-year-old man can't tell me
not to. Well, listen...

39:44.160 --> 39:47.120
Am I allowed to have a drink on the-
tube? No, you're not. Here's why.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.120
There are people who drink on
the tube with a six packs of beer
who loll around swearing

39:52.720 --> 39:55.800
and cursing who offer aggression
towards their fellow passengers.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.720
And I think that removing that
possibility actually makes
the tube friendlier.

40:02.520 --> 40:05.000
Although I have to admit, it was
rather wonderful that thousands

40:05.760 --> 40:09.400
of people had a party,
hurling execration at my name...

40:11.120 --> 40:16.280
Over that? Over that. It took
Margaret Thatcher ten years
to achieve that level

40:16.960 --> 40:19.800
of unpopularity with
the youth of society.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.600
I thought it was quite something
to have pulled it off
after only six weeks.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.320
You are going to allow motorcycles
to travel in bus lanes.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.080
From January there is going
to be a trial.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.160
Because I think it would smooth,
smooth traffic flow,

40:34.280 --> 40:35.760
provided those motorcyclists
remember that

40:36.520 --> 40:39.720
they can't terrify vulnerable
road users such as cyclists.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.560
What about bus drivers?

40:43.280 --> 40:44.560
You cycle, have you not been
attacked by a bus driver?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.760
You don't cycle?
No. Because I have a car.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.600
Talk to the little one...
Hammond? Yes!

40:52.680 --> 40:54.880
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

40:56.600 --> 40:59.200
He...
He knows what he's talking about.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.200
I remember watching your show
where he beat you hollow around
London on his bike.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.800
You were going by speedboat,
he was far quicker than you.

41:07.920 --> 41:12.920
He will confirm that bus drivers
are, in fact, extremely considerate.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.680
What he actually says is they
are a load of murdering BEEP!

41:18.760 --> 41:20.080
I speak from experience.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.560
They look at their mirrors,
they know where you are

41:23.160 --> 41:25.280
and by comparison with HGV drivers,-
they are extremely good.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.920
No, I won't have that.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.040
MUTTERING IN CROWD

41:31.080 --> 41:32.640
Who thinks lorry drivers...

41:33.600 --> 41:35.120
I'm a big fan of lorry drivers...

41:36.800 --> 41:37.720
Well, I...!

41:38.480 --> 41:39.720
Who thinks lorry drivers
are better than bus drivers?

41:40.360 --> 41:42.640
Before I needlessly throw away the
lorry driver vote... You just have!

41:43.360 --> 41:45.320
I just want to say
that they are not all bad...

41:46.440 --> 41:48.320
LAUGHTER

41:49.280 --> 41:51.160
But they need to look in their
mirrors. Let's move it on.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.240
If I may.

41:55.120 --> 41:56.640
You were the motoring
correspondent of GQ magazine.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.160
Yes. Do you know...
Where's this going?

42:02.880 --> 42:06.640
Do you know how much you
built up in parking tickets
on those cars that you tested?

42:07.640 --> 42:09.840
I can tell you something, I jolly
well paid them because... Now.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.080
Your publisher argues with that.

42:14.040 --> 42:15.560
LAUGHTER

42:17.640 --> 42:18.880
There were two phases
in our relationship.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.240
There was the phase where they paid-
for the parking tickets and...

42:22.280 --> 42:23.640
Do you know how much the phase
cost them

42:24.280 --> 42:26.760
when they were paying for them? No.-
£4,500.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.480
CROWD GROANS

42:30.640 --> 42:31.960
So they may claim now!

42:35.320 --> 42:37.320
While we're on the subject of this,-
there's a photograph -

42:38.080 --> 42:39.320
we brought this up on
the programme a few weeks ago -

42:40.440 --> 42:41.720
this is a message from you on
the back of one of the lovely buses.

42:42.600 --> 42:45.880
Changing gears at lower revs
reduces your C02 emissions
and saves you money.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.960
Very good. You've put that up.
Absolutely right.

42:50.680 --> 42:51.960
Let me draw your attention to
something you wrote in GQ magazine.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.280
"The essence of it is, in my view,
not to change up until you
hit about 6,000rpm."

43:02.520 --> 43:06.120
In the case of the Ferrari 430...
LAUGHTER

43:08.840 --> 43:10.720
..which I was...
I admit I was driving.

43:12.200 --> 43:13.560
It may very well be that that
was the cleanest, greenest,

43:14.920 --> 43:18.720
most fuel-efficient way...
of changing gear!

43:23.760 --> 43:27.520
On your very track the other day,
I was introduced to this wonderful

43:28.360 --> 43:30.880
electric car by the proprietor
of this Dunsfold track. Yes.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.360
And we've all got to go electric.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.520
1p a mile. Where does
the power come from, Boris?

43:38.840 --> 43:40.480
It comes from the plug.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.440
In fact, I'll tell you something...

43:44.520 --> 43:46.320
LAUGHTER

43:47.840 --> 43:48.920
You...

43:51.080 --> 43:54.280
..I make this prophecy,
Jeremy, that
the gear is going to be obsolete

43:55.480 --> 43:58.080
and your programme will have
to change its name to Top Plug.

44:01.240 --> 44:02.640
Can I just talk about the Olympics?

44:03.240 --> 44:04.520
I know this is off topic.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.000
We are going to make
a mess of it, aren't we?

44:08.960 --> 44:10.600
No. It's going to be fantastic.
We're going to ruin it. No.

44:11.920 --> 44:15.720
We're going to do it brilliantly
but in our own particular,
ingenious...British way.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.480
LAUGHTER

44:18.600 --> 44:20.080
I just have this vision
of the opening ceremony

44:22.440 --> 44:24.600
and there'll be one council house
in the middle of it and
a bloke going, "I'm not moving!"

44:26.200 --> 44:27.440
You know in Beijing when it closed,

44:28.200 --> 44:30.080
you were there of course,
the British...

44:30.800 --> 44:34.360
handing over ceremony, there was
a bus and a girl from the X Factor.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.560
People would have thought,
"Great country."

44:42.160 --> 44:43.200
Instead of going,
"That looks like BEEP."

44:45.120 --> 44:46.640
People loved it with that thing
with Beckham kicking a football.

44:47.640 --> 44:50.080
No, Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin,
I'm very fond of that.

44:50.960 --> 44:54.480
But Jimmy Page standing out
the back of a burning Jaguar,
power-sliding round.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.600
Fantastic. Perhaps we should
commission some of your ideas for
the opening ceremony.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.080
Let's do that, can we do that?!

45:05.720 --> 45:07.040
I'll ring Jimmy Page immediately.

45:07.720 --> 45:08.640
APPLAUSE

45:12.040 --> 45:14.880
The lap was, pouring with rain. It
didn't go quite as smoothly as
perhaps you'd hoped.

45:16.840 --> 45:19.040
Most people, as you know, spin off
on the second to last corner.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.480
Boris decided he was going to
spin of on every single corner.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.000
LAUGHTER

45:26.560 --> 45:27.600
Who'd like to see Boris's
practices?

45:28.280 --> 45:29.240
AUDIENCE: Yes!

45:30.360 --> 45:33.160
Shall we have a look at some?
Second to last corner, there's the
traditional spot for going off.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.200
Here we are on the final corner...
Here we go again.

45:39.160 --> 45:42.600
Here we are on the actual
pass the tyres was there.

45:49.560 --> 45:50.480
The problem is,
Boris, you can't turn left.

45:50.960 --> 45:52.960
Wait - you go right here and...

45:55.480 --> 45:57.240
First person ever to go off on the
follow-through.

45:58.600 --> 45:59.720
Well done, Boris.

46:06.360 --> 46:09.200
The atmospheric conditions
were challenging.
It was your fault.

46:11.840 --> 46:15.120
If you believe that cars cause
global warming, get a Range
Rover and it will warm it up.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.200
Anyway, you did eventually

46:19.960 --> 46:21.440
complete a lap.
Who'd like to see that?

46:22.040 --> 46:23.120
AUDIENCE: Yes!

46:24.600 --> 46:26.800
Let's have a look at Boris's
lap here. It really is wet,
isn't it?

46:32.600 --> 46:35.080
There's a determined-looking man
behind the wheel there.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.520
That's soaking wet.

46:40.200 --> 46:41.480
Trinny and Susannah wet.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.760
Looking smooth.

46:44.200 --> 46:45.360
HE MUMBLES

46:46.200 --> 46:47.600
Talking in Greek.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.960
HE MUMBLES

46:53.880 --> 46:56.800
More funny noises.
And into the hammer head.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.960
you are in the lines or not.

47:00.040 --> 47:05.040
Yes, no, actually, well done.
Sounding patronising, I apologise.
This is good coming out.

47:06.720 --> 47:07.880
No, hit the rev limit.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.800
Happy, were we, with our gear
change?

47:13.640 --> 47:19.840
That's lovely. Watch out for
the rubber tyres. The rubber tyres.-
Yes, missed those. Come on, Boris.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.680
You've slowed.

47:23.520 --> 47:24.800
Come on, faster, faster.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.040
It's a gamble.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.840
A bit wide but well held. There we
are, across the line.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.600
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

47:40.440 --> 47:44.120
To be brutally honest,
in conditions such as those
you aren't really realistically...

47:45.360 --> 47:48.040
Keith Allen would be our fastest
very wet lap on 1.51.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.840
There is no point hoping for that.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.440
No. I've no idea how fast it was.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.920
Did it feel...
I thought it was pretty good.

47:58.520 --> 48:00.880
Pretty sluggish. You think so? Yeah.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.360
You did it in 1...

48:04.360 --> 48:06.800
Which in itself in conditions
like that... I like that word.

48:08.760 --> 48:09.800
Would you like to stop
the interview there. Yeah.

48:11.840 --> 48:15.520
Good idea, because the
next bit is a 50... 57.4.

48:16.640 --> 48:18.760
Which puts you... And give him
a round of applause...

48:25.800 --> 48:30.080
I'm off the bottom. Now I look
at it, it's catastrophically bad.

48:30.800 --> 48:31.960
LAUGHTER

48:33.200 --> 48:36.760
There's no other word. It's the
slowest very wet. No, it's the same-
as Fiona Bruce. I feel proud.

48:38.960 --> 48:40.960
Very proud, and it's been
marvellous having you here, Boris.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.400
Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Johnson.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

48:52.320 --> 48:57.040
Every week on Top Gear we get
a stack of letters. But this week,
one in particular caught our eye.

48:58.880 --> 49:03.520
It's from a Mr Needham and it says,-
"Why do not test cars properly any
more, have you forgotten how?"

49:05.440 --> 49:08.760
This really hurt us so we decided
to take the new Ford Fiesta and do

49:09.480 --> 49:12.800
a proper road test, like they used
to do on Top Gear in the old days.

49:14.040 --> 49:18.200
We were quite looking forward to it-
but at the very last minute, Jeremy-
came in and said he wanted to do it.

49:26.160 --> 49:28.360
Right. There's the car in
question, the new Fiesta.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.840
What I thought I'd do is break
the road test down into segments.
Hopefully, cover all the bases.

49:42.320 --> 49:47.960
Behind the extremely pretty body,
I'm sorry to report there are
one or two small problems.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.120
The back seats, for
instance, do not fold flat.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.680
Other cars in this price range
do have bigger boots.

49:58.400 --> 50:02.320
However, despite this, there
is still room in the boot
for a zebra's head.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.760
Pop the neck in first.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
There we are. So if you're
a sort of Mafia game ranger,

50:09.760 --> 50:10.960
that goes very nicely.

50:12.800 --> 50:17.040
Then, in the back seat, there's
room for the traditional
2.2 children.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.440
I should say so. This new car maybe-
the biggest Fiesta yet,

50:29.520 --> 50:32.440
but it's a whopping 40 kilograms
lighter than the last model.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.200
That'll help at the pumps.

50:38.120 --> 50:43.200
There's even a 1.6 litre diesel
model called the Econetic,
which produces such a small amount

50:43.840 --> 50:46.920
of carbon dioxide you pay
no road tax on it at all.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.640
I wouldn't bother with that
particular model though, because
it'll almost certainly be sh...

50:58.560 --> 51:02.320
Ever since the Ford Focus came
along in 1998, or whenever it was,

51:04.160 --> 51:10.600
all Fords have had a driving feel
that you just don't get in other
cars of the same size or price.

51:14.320 --> 51:15.720
This is no different.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.320
Here, as I go through the
hammerhead, for example,

51:20.920 --> 51:25.960
I can feel that it has a sort of
Volkswagen feel of solidity
and a Lotus feel of sportiness.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.320
Rare to get that combination.

51:36.360 --> 51:39.640
The steering has a linear response,-
understeer well taken,
no tread shuffle.

51:47.480 --> 51:51.280
It feels fabulous.
And if you go for the 1.6 litre

51:52.520 --> 51:56.400
TV CT engine that I have in this
test car, it's pretty fast as well.

51:58.280 --> 52:00.680
Certainly, it will
easily do 70mph,
which is what I'm doing now.

52:01.920 --> 52:04.280
That's the maximum speed that you
can go in Britain, so that's good.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.640
Is this thorough enough for you,
Mr Needham? I hope so because
it's going well.

52:18.320 --> 52:22.960
Hopefully not. Apart from the
fact it's made by Germans, most of
the equipment on this car has been

52:24.160 --> 52:28.200
fitted to other Fords for years
and we've heard no horror stories.

52:32.680 --> 52:36.560
There's an entry-level version,
which has no equipment on it at all-
so there's nothing to go wrong.

52:39.120 --> 52:41.360
Do you want that one, though -
really, honestly, a basic model?

52:43.000 --> 52:44.200
I bet that's also sh...

52:52.120 --> 52:55.080
Of course it's easy to park. It's
got windows, a steering wheel.

52:57.280 --> 52:58.560
There we are.

52:59.520 --> 53:00.200
Next.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.240
This can happen.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.400
Oh, and it just has. Here we go!

53:27.760 --> 53:30.880
Good grip. Power...

53:34.600 --> 53:37.200
I am now
breaking the speed limit indoors.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.520
He's right on my tail.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.960
This is where
front-wheel-drive comes in.

53:46.240 --> 53:47.400
Round the palm-tree, there we go.

53:52.080 --> 53:53.880
He's taken out Costa Coffee.

53:56.040 --> 53:58.280
The baddie has made the
classic baddie error.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.880
He's got too much power.

54:02.080 --> 54:03.720
I've got 120 horsepower in this.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.800
You don't want any more
than that on marble.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.480
The bears.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.200
The handbrake.

54:19.600 --> 54:22.320
Does he have to hit
absolutely everything?

54:26.320 --> 54:27.680
Steering is light,
turning circle is good.

54:29.320 --> 54:33.560
I was once chased through
a shopping centre
in Putney, actually, by baddies.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.440
I had an original Mini and, I
must say, that was very good.

54:38.600 --> 54:39.880
Just cut through
British Home Stores.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.320
Dab on the handbrake
and there we go.

54:50.040 --> 54:50.600
Mmm...

54:52.560 --> 54:55.720
The Corvette is stuck
in British Home Stores. Turning
circle, not good enough.

55:04.720 --> 55:05.680
I'm getting away.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.920
Instruments are superb,
really sharp.

55:19.680 --> 55:20.960
Handbrake!

55:23.040 --> 55:24.640
TYRES SCREECH

55:25.880 --> 55:28.680
The headlamps are brilliant.
Excellent range on full beam.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.720
Look at him.

55:34.480 --> 55:38.120
Look at him! He'll never follow me
if I go through here.

55:40.280 --> 55:42.040
Oh, he is doing!

56:02.720 --> 56:04.360
The upshot is that
after half-an-hour,

56:05.240 --> 56:09.040
I got out of the shopping centre
and the 'Vette didn't.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
Yes... Very.

56:35.120 --> 56:41.520
Well, prices start at around £8,500-
but you need £11,000 to get
a decent mid-range model.

56:42.720 --> 56:45.440
So if you have £11,000 to spend
on a car then, yes, you can.

56:46.760 --> 56:46.800
But if you've only got 40p then,

56:02.440 --> 56:04.960
The upshot is that
after half an hour,

56:04.960 --> 56:09.200
I got out of the shopping centre
and the 'Vette didn't.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.600
Yes. Very.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.240
Well, prices start at around £8,500,

56:38.240 --> 56:42.360
but you need £11,000 to get
a decent mid-range model.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.520
So if you have £11,000 to spend
on a car, then yes, you can.

56:46.520 --> 56:54.000
But if you've only got 40p,
then no, you can't.

57:02.880 --> 57:06.800
Although it is quite large for
a supermini, very large, in fact,

57:06.800 --> 57:12.120
it still fits
on the marines' LCV Mark 5
landing craft with room to spare.

57:15.440 --> 57:18.760
Now, if you'll forgive me,
we are approaching the beach.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.560
The gunfire has started.
Lads, do you want to mount up?

57:21.560 --> 57:24.480
HELICOPTER BLADES WHIR

57:24.480 --> 57:26.760
GUNFIRE

57:27.520 --> 57:29.800
That gunfire can be
quite loud, can't it?

57:29.800 --> 57:33.600
If you get that door shut...
You can barely hear it now.

57:34.400 --> 57:35.920
GUNFIRE

57:38.160 --> 57:42.800
Look at that! The smoke grenades
fit perfectly in the cup holders.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.960
How much ammo can you get
in the glove box? Just two mags?

57:51.720 --> 57:54.480
The windscreen is heated,
but not bullet-proof.

57:57.480 --> 57:59.560
Stand by the beach!

58:01.680 --> 58:03.320
You cold? Yeah, I am, actually.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.600
HELICOPTER BLADES WHIR

58:11.320 --> 58:13.680
SHOUTING AND GUNFIRE

58:32.480 --> 58:36.560
SHOUTING AND GUNFIRE
Let's go! Come on!

58:36.560 --> 58:38.680
Come on, Fiesta!

58:40.680 --> 58:44.120
That's a lot deeper than I thought!

58:44.120 --> 58:46.880
Look at this
for a beach assault craft!

58:48.400 --> 58:50.600
You've got a bit
of water coming in there.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.120
Come on! Are we there yet?

58:54.880 --> 58:57.720
You kids are being annoying.
Shoot them!

58:57.720 --> 58:59.880
SHOUTING AND GUNFIRE

58:59.880 --> 59:01.720
Where am I going, boys?

59:11.440 --> 59:14.880
Do you want to shoot from in here?
Would that be more comfortable?

59:15.680 --> 59:19.120
It's got electric windows.
I'll just put...

59:21.160 --> 59:23.240
GUNFIRE

59:23.240 --> 59:26.880
Go, go, go! Shoot the enemy
in the middle of its face!

59:31.000 --> 59:34.120
Carry on, there's a plucky chap!
Well done.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.400
These carpets are excellent.

59:38.400 --> 59:40.720
No evidence at all
of the marines' muddy boots.

59:45.640 --> 59:47.480
So, there you are, Mr Needham.

59:49.200 --> 59:54.680
The most thorough test of a car ever
undertaken on British television.

59:54.680 --> 59:58.120
The Fiesta's come through
with flying colours.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.720
Drive safely.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.080
Absolutely thorough. Well done.
Foot on the bonnet
at the end, traditional.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.880
Jumper...all of it.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.760
Anyway, that's all we've got
time for this week.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.280
Next week, for reasons we don't
understand, we're on at 9pm.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.720
We'll see you then, unless you're
watching this on Dave. In February.
in the middle of the afternoon.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.840
In which case, we hope
you get a job soon.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.760
Take care. See you soon. Bye.
