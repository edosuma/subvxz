Dexter, Dexter honey?

00:45.466 --> 00:47.350
Dexter: Yes?

00:47.383 --> 00:50.183
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're reading.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.183
Yes.

00:52.216 --> 00:55.083
Oh, you just
look so cute

00:55.116 --> 00:57.316
in your little
story corner.

00:57.350 --> 01:01.166
Dexter,
I came to ask you
a little favor.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.433
Yes?

01:02.466 --> 01:05.100
Your sister's
feeling
a little puny.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.166
Seems she caught
a little bug.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.166
So,
I was thinking

01:10.200 --> 01:12.416
it might make
Dee Dee feel
a lot better

01:12.450 --> 01:15.300
if you went
and read your book
with her.

01:15.333 --> 01:19.200
What?! If she has got
the creeping crud,
count me out!

01:19.233 --> 01:21.216
I'm not going nowhere near

01:21.250 --> 01:24.000
that infectious,
plague-ridden sack of cooties.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.366
Dexter!

01:25.400 --> 01:28.050
Well, I don't want
to get it on me.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.450
[Angrily]
Be nice and read a story

01:30.483 --> 01:32.433
to your sick sister!

01:32.466 --> 01:34.483
Dearest Dee Dee
is ill, you say?

01:35.016 --> 01:36.383
I must away
to her bedside

01:36.416 --> 01:39.250
to comfort her
in her time of need.

01:39.283 --> 01:41.400
[Breathing echoing]

01:41.433 --> 01:44.000
Dexter,
is that you?

01:44.033 --> 01:46.466
I have come to read to you
during your incapacitation.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.050

that's so sweet!

01:51.350 --> 01:54.116
Uh-huh. Now let's
get this over with.

01:54.150 --> 01:57.033
You silly,
you need to come
up here with me.

01:57.066 --> 01:58.450
Aah!

01:58.483 --> 02:02.216
Now I want you
to be all comfy cozy

02:02.250 --> 02:05.483
because you're
the bestest brother
I ever had.

02:06.016 --> 02:09.050
Ooh! I love you
so very, very much!

02:09.083 --> 02:10.200
Aah! Whew.

02:10.233 --> 02:11.383
Comfy?

02:11.416 --> 02:13.466
Comfy?!
I have been
contaminated!

02:14.016 --> 02:15.466
I got to get
the heck--

02:17.300 --> 02:20.016
back to reading
this whimsical fable

02:20.050 --> 02:22.200
to my
precious sister.

Ooh, a fair!

11:25.133 --> 11:27.266
[Teeth chattering]

11:27.300 --> 11:28.350
Dee Dee: Whee!

11:28.383 --> 11:31.150
Aah!

11:31.183 --> 11:33.316
Help!

11:33.350 --> 11:36.350
Dee Dee: Whee!

11:36.383 --> 11:38.066
[Dee Dee laughing]

11:43.416 --> 11:45.083
Woo!

11:45.116 --> 11:47.200
Look, Dexter,
toys!

11:47.233 --> 11:49.400
Please, can we
go down now?

11:49.433 --> 11:52.283
I don't feel
so good.

11:52.316 --> 11:54.216
[Stomach grumbling]

11:54.250 --> 11:56.116
Sure!
Aah!

11:56.150 --> 11:59.233
[Dexter moaning]

11:59.266 --> 12:01.016
Stop!

12:01.050 --> 12:04.150
Dee Dee:
I want one of those
and 3 of those.

12:04.183 --> 12:06.233
Please, Dee Dee,
we have to get home.

12:06.266 --> 12:08.216
Dad will be
furious with us.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.333
No more ballet lessons.

12:10.366 --> 12:11.433
[Tires screech]

12:11.466 --> 12:13.233
Ok.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.433
[Siren]

12:18.466 --> 12:21.333
Dexter: Oh, no.
We are being chased
by the coppers.

12:27.266 --> 12:29.050
[Yawns]

12:29.083 --> 12:31.150
Rise and shine, honey.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.383
It's Sunday,
and it's almost time

12:33.416 --> 12:35.450
for the family road trip.

12:35.483 --> 12:38.150
What if dad
finds out about this?

12:38.183 --> 12:40.450
Dee Dee, go faster.
Don't pull over,
no matter what.

12:40.483 --> 12:43.016
But, Dexter,
we'll get arrested!

12:43.050 --> 12:45.383
That is nothing
compared to
what dad will do

12:45.416 --> 12:48.383
if he finds out.
We'll be grounded
for weeks.

12:48.416 --> 12:51.133
Honey,
I am making
extra sandwiches

12:51.166 --> 12:53.166
in case the kids
get hungry.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.400
Father:
Good idea, muffin.

12:55.433 --> 12:58.383
Mmm. Pepperoni
and jelly--my favorite.

12:58.416 --> 13:01.133
[Sirens]

13:01.166 --> 13:03.433
Dee Dee,
you are almost out of gas.

13:03.466 --> 13:06.300
There is only 5 minutes left
before the road trip.

13:13.216 --> 13:15.183
[Panting]

13:15.216 --> 13:18.100
Oh, too late.
It is 9:00.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.416
Father:
There you are, Dexter.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.066
[Gulp]

13:21.100 --> 13:23.400
You just can't wait
for our trip, can you?

13:23.433 --> 13:26.383
But--but, dad,
I have to explain.

13:26.416 --> 13:29.133
The antimatter
and then Dee Dee

13:29.166 --> 13:32.033
and then the car
and there was
a big flash and then--

13:32.066 --> 13:33.466
Dexter,
have you seen
your sister?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.300
It's time
we got going.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.333
But that is what
I have been trying
to tell you!

13:37.366 --> 13:39.233
She's in the car.

13:39.266 --> 13:41.316
Well, good.
You hop in, too,

13:41.350 --> 13:43.400
and we'll take off.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.116
[Guns being cocked]

13:45.150 --> 13:48.283
All right, everyone,
come on out
with your hands up.

13:48.316 --> 13:50.166
[Pop]

13:50.200 --> 13:52.000

[Pop]

13:53.400 --> 13:56.083
Ouch!

13:56.116 --> 13:59.266
Excuse me.
I guess I wasn't
out of<i>gas</i>

13:59.300 --> 14:01.133
hee hee.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.300
[Dexter laughs]

14:02.333 --> 14:03.333
[Laughing]

14:03.366 --> 14:05.366
[Laughing]

14:26.383 --> 14:31.216
Ah. Time now
for a nice sit.

14:34.333 --> 14:38.050
Hey, what do
I look like,
a chair?

14:38.083 --> 14:41.416
No. "I"
looks like<i>this.</i>

15:29.283 --> 15:31.266
Hi, Dexter!

15:31.300 --> 15:33.450
[Whispering]
Dee Dee, what
are you doing here?

15:33.483 --> 15:36.183
I gots me
a book on ponies!

15:36.216 --> 15:38.350
Want to see?

15:38.383 --> 15:40.383
[Whispering]
I have no time
for pretty ponies.

15:40.416 --> 15:43.016
I am reading
for science.
Now beat it.

15:43.050 --> 15:44.116
What?!

15:44.150 --> 15:46.050
Dee Dee,
will you stop
being so loud,

15:46.083 --> 15:48.000
and get your book
and get lost?

15:48.033 --> 15:49.083
What?! Speak up!

15:49.116 --> 15:51.233
Dee Dee, will you
quit yelling?

15:51.266 --> 15:53.366
This is a library.
You must keep quiet.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.150
Now, Dee Dee,

15:57.183 --> 15:59.483
the head librarian
is checking out
books today.

16:00.016 --> 16:02.183
So you please
show some respect.
Keep your yap shut.

16:02.216 --> 16:05.133
Oh, yeah?
Well, why should I?!

16:05.166 --> 16:08.233
Because, Dee Dee,
I have a reputation
to uphold.

16:08.266 --> 16:11.033
For, you see, I have been
the library patron
of the month...

16:11.066 --> 16:12.450
For the past 12 months.

16:12.483 --> 16:15.366
So if you would
just shut up, clam up,
button your lip,

16:15.400 --> 16:18.166
close your cake-hole,
and please be quiet,

16:18.200 --> 16:20.450
everything will be
hunky-dory, ok?
Now come on.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.450
Ok!

16:25.433 --> 16:27.316
[Whistles]

16:27.350 --> 16:30.100
Dexter: Here are
my selections
for today, miss l.

16:30.133 --> 16:33.150
My, my, Dexter,
what a big stack
you have.

16:33.183 --> 16:36.066
Why, Dexter,
you're quite
the little scholar.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.316
Ah, shucks.

16:37.350 --> 16:38.433
Oh, brother.

16:38.466 --> 16:41.133
Miss l: You know,
if you keep
this reading up,

16:41.166 --> 16:44.400
you'll be
the patron of the month
all of next year, too.

16:44.433 --> 16:47.133
I don't think
even Einstein himself

16:47.166 --> 16:49.150
was such an avid reader
as you, Dexter.

16:49.183 --> 16:52.100
No television
and donuts for you.

16:52.133 --> 16:55.100
I bet it's just
all study, study, study
day and night.

16:55.133 --> 16:58.350
Well, Dexter,
I think you're all set.
There you go.

16:58.383 --> 17:01.100
Thank you,
miss l.
Come on, Dee Dee.

17:01.133 --> 17:04.083
Hey, Dex,
there's no pictures
in this book.

17:04.116 --> 17:05.383
Dee Dee,
come on!

17:05.416 --> 17:07.383
But you forgot to--
Dee Dee!

17:07.416 --> 17:09.200
You forgot
to check out!

17:09.233 --> 17:10.416
Move it
or lose it,
sister!

17:14.000 --> 17:15.266
Uh-huh.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.150
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

17:17.183 --> 17:18.400
[Yawns]

17:18.433 --> 17:21.166
Hey, Dexter!
Here's a book
you forgot!

17:21.200 --> 17:23.166
Why, thank you,
Dee Dee.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.266
Ah, more
learning material.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.483
Oh!

17:27.016 --> 17:28.166
No stamp!

17:28.200 --> 17:31.100
This book has been
illegally checked out.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.466
Oh, Dexter,
how could you?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.100
Your actions
have brought shame
upon this library.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.400
For this,
you shall
be punished!

17:40.433 --> 17:42.416
You're banned

17:42.450 --> 17:45.066
from
the library...

17:45.100 --> 17:46.400
Forever!

17:46.433 --> 17:48.383
Aah!

17:48.416 --> 17:51.333
Deflected!

17:51.366 --> 17:54.416
It's awfully hot
where you're going,
Dexter.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.266
[Slap]

17:56.300 --> 17:58.283
[Laughing]

17:58.316 --> 18:01.483
Welcome
to library heck.

18:02.016 --> 18:04.266
Ha ha ha...

18:06.266 --> 18:08.383
The book
must be returned.

18:08.416 --> 18:10.150
Just do it!

18:10.183 --> 18:12.366
Vision goggles,
bibliograph,

[Thunder]

18:31.483 --> 18:33.250
Are you quite finished?

18:33.283 --> 18:35.116
Now I'm going in.

18:35.150 --> 18:37.350
You just lower me
down on this rope,

18:37.383 --> 18:40.000
and I'll return
the book.

18:40.033 --> 18:43.216
Remember, this
is a library mission,
so keep quiet.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.066
Okey-dokey!

18:45.100 --> 18:47.000
[Sighs]

18:47.033 --> 18:48.350
Hold this.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.466
Fat porkster.

18:55.016 --> 18:56.316
Ooh.

18:56.350 --> 18:57.350

18:57.383 --> 18:59.133

Whew.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.250
Hi!

19:38.283 --> 19:41.033
Ah! How did you--
what? How'd you get--

19:41.066 --> 19:44.150
that's it!
I've had it with
your monkey business.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.450
But--

19:45.483 --> 19:47.116
quiet!

19:47.150 --> 19:50.016
[Dexter's voice echoing]

19:50.050 --> 19:53.283

Warning.
Noise level exceeded.

19:53.316 --> 19:54.283

20:18.083 --> 20:20.250
[Growls]

20:36.083 --> 20:37.283
Dexter: Yep, just books.

20:37.316 --> 20:39.283
Judge us only by looks

20:39.316 --> 20:41.416
because we're
just plain old books.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.033
I think
we lost them.

20:44.066 --> 20:46.283
Dexter, I'm tired
of this game.

20:46.316 --> 20:48.250
I quit playing.

20:48.283 --> 20:51.033
Quit? What do you mean quit?

20:51.066 --> 20:54.250
It is too late for quitsies now,
woman. We must fight.

we quit. You win!

21:00.016 --> 21:02.183
Dexter: Traitor!

21:02.216 --> 21:05.483
What?
Why, Dee Dee,

21:06.016 --> 21:08.033
thank you
for apprehending

21:08.066 --> 21:10.116
