00:26.327 --> 00:29.897
Colby! Colby!

00:29.897 --> 00:31.832
You did it!
That was your fastest time yet.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.867
- Oh, faster than Maui?
- Yeah.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.336
How much did I
beat Sergio by?

00:35.336 --> 00:37.004
- At least a second.
- Oh!

00:37.004 --> 00:38.406
Sponsors are gonna be
over the moon!

00:38.406 --> 00:39.740
I'm so proud of you, sweetie.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.509
Oh, there's my girl!

00:45.246 --> 00:47.381
Oh, you killed it.
- So did you.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.317
You killed it.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.076
Hey, sorry.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.611
Drinks went a little later
than I thought.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.880
Wish you would have joined us.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.382
I made sushi.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.151
The uni's fresh from Hokkaido.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.385
Oh, yum city.

01:24.385 --> 01:25.753
Well, I'll be home soon.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.988
No way.
I got you next time.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.724
Colby, is there somebody
in the car with you?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.560
Uh, I'm just gonna
drop Roger off at his place.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.395
It's all good. See you soon.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.432
Hey, hey.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.357
Sorry I can't come over.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.592
It's okay.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.328
Last night,
Sparrow May was found dead

03:14.328 --> 03:16.063
in her apartment
in South Philly.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.831
The front door was ajar,
there was no forced entry.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.467
The neighbor called it in.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.134
27 years old
and a rising star

03:21.134 --> 03:22.770
in the alt-triathlon world.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.805
- Ah, she was an Ironman woman?
- To the extreme--

03:24.805 --> 03:27.107
open water swimming,
cross-country running,

03:27.107 --> 03:29.377
obstacle courses.
It's a whole vibe.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.513
The race she ran yesterday
is called the Polar Xpress.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.148
It's described
as 75% race, 25% party.

03:35.148 --> 03:39.420
She was stabbed 20 times,
cut so deep they chipped bone.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.654
It sounds like
she knew her killer.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.090
First person of interest
is Colby Dysart,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.825
current leader
in the men's division.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.760
Comes from
Atlanta Buckhead money.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.096
Last seen leaving
a local bar with Sparrow.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.498
And the second person?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.500
Colby's live-in girlfriend, Mavis.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.535
Mavis is a wellness fanatic--

03:54.535 --> 03:58.272
an ethos that extends to every
corner of her macrobiotic life.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.575
Mavis was spotted on the Jersey
turnpike earlier this morning,

04:01.575 --> 04:03.811
driving her 2022 Polestar,

04:03.811 --> 04:06.614
crossing state lines,
making this case ours.

04:06.614 --> 04:07.915
What about Colby?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.383
Philly PD has him in
for questioning

04:09.383 --> 04:10.884
but hasn't gotten far.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.853
If Mavis found out
that Sparrow

04:12.853 --> 04:15.556
was with Colby last night,
maybe jealousy is the motive?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.758
Or maybe Sparrow and Colby
were hooking up,

04:17.758 --> 04:20.594
Colby kills Sparrow
to keep their affair secret.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.029
Love, man, I tell you.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.698
Makes people
lose their minds.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.734
God, I miss it.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.001
Says the man
who's been divorced twice?

04:28.001 --> 04:31.839
Call me crazy,
but I still believe in love.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.240
Well, Sparrow was
an athlete, right?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.942
She would have been
strong enough to fight back.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.577
Did Colby have
any defensive wounds?

04:36.577 --> 04:39.713
Nope--no bloody clothes,
no murder weapon recovered yet.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.615
ERT has the scene.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.884
Mavis' phone is off.
We do have a BOLO out.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.453
Now I'm gonna get in touch
with Polestar

04:45.453 --> 04:46.587
and see if they'll cooperate,

04:46.587 --> 04:48.021
but they're gonna want
a warrant.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.190
We don't have enough yet
for a warrant on Mavis.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.826
Philly PD wants us to track
her down for questioning.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.395
Why New Jersey?
She have family there?

04:54.395 --> 04:55.696
Queens, Breezy Point.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.164
The Irish Riviera.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.566
I don't know that area.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.633
That's where a lot
of law enforcement

04:59.633 --> 05:00.901
and first responders live.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.003
Mavis comes from a family
of firefighters.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.972
Kristen, you and I
will head over there now.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.040
Barnes, Ray,
take a run at Colby,

05:07.040 --> 05:08.709
see what he remembers
about that night.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.243
A lot of eyes on this one,
little homeys.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.079
Let's roll.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.983
I mean, look at them--
puppies, sunsets, van life.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.885
This is what Instagram
was made for.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.121
This story has everything--
sushi, interracial sex,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.156
a middle-aged woman
out for blood.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.292
A perfect case
for "Wanted: America."

05:25.292 --> 05:26.960
How middle-aged?

05:26.960 --> 05:28.829
Mavis just turned 40,
but she's got incredible skin.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.863
I mean, look at her.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.298
Don't you wanna be her?

05:31.298 --> 05:33.200
What I want
is to be 20 pounds lighter

05:33.200 --> 05:35.268
and on the other end
of my divorce.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.371
What do we do about
that fire in Hoboken?

05:37.371 --> 05:39.239
Dead kids have nothing
on dead pretty people.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.443
We spent two weeks
on six dead kids.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.878
This murder was in
the "Enquirer" this morning.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.747
It'll be national
any second now.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.549
I bet my regional Emmy on it.

05:48.549 --> 05:49.550
But no warrants out?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.251
Not yet.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.926
It's gonna be a challenge
to cast these reenactments,

05:58.926 --> 06:00.894
to find people
who look that good?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.362
I call dibs on cameraman Joe.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.697
Em!

06:05.966 --> 06:09.437
Until a warrant comes down,
tread lightly.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.838
Tread lightly.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.305
For sure, of course.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.542
That's not
what you're known for!

06:14.542 --> 06:16.009
There's no way my baby girl

06:16.009 --> 06:17.678
had anything to do
with that murder.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.179
Maybe we should come in
and talk about it.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.381
Colby's the one
you should be looking at.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.016
He's an abusive, no good--

06:23.016 --> 06:25.152
Abusive how, Captain?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.655
Always putting himself first.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.289
Throwing his family name around.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.659
Dysart this, Dysart that.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.226
Running all over the world.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.563
He's never worked
an honest day in his life.

06:35.563 --> 06:39.533
Captain, we know
you've already lost one child.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.035
A son, right? In Tower Two.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.572
And all we wanna do
is talk to your daughter.

06:44.572 --> 06:48.609
We can protect her.
From Colby, even.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.143
I appreciate that.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.212
When's the last time
you spoke with Mavis?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.981
Sunday at noon,
just like always.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.449
You mind if we look
at your phone?

06:55.449 --> 06:57.184
Yeah, I mind.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.286
You're retired FD,
your brother's on the force,

06:59.286 --> 07:00.688
your nephew's an EMT.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.255
You know how this goes.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.692
Yeah.
It's called confirmation bias.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
You see it on the news
all the time.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.629
You people make up
your mind about a case,

07:08.629 --> 07:11.699
and then you find every little
thing you can to back it up.

07:11.699 --> 07:12.966
Keeps you
from seeing the truth.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.434
And what is the truth,
Captain?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.869
There's a killer out there.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.506
And until I know for sure
my daughter's safe,

07:18.506 --> 07:20.440
I'm not talking to nobody.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.215
Mavis and I would--

07:28.215 --> 07:30.250
after a while, things were
just different, you know?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.384
Enlighten me.

07:33.621 --> 07:36.890
Things just weren't as fresh.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.592
So we started
seeing other people,

07:38.592 --> 07:40.460
mix things up a little bit.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.862
And it wasn't for long.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.631
Sparrow and I only connected
for about two weeks.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.665
You know,
you were the last person

07:44.665 --> 07:47.234
to see Sparrow May alive.

07:47.234 --> 07:51.238
Did--did I connect with her
the day that she died?

07:51.238 --> 07:55.075
Yes, just like I told
the other detective before.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.712
After I dropped Sparrow off,
I went home.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.714
Mavis wasn't there,
I passed out.

08:00.714 --> 08:04.217
The next day, I woke up,
she was gone, had packed a bag.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.087
And she was cool with y'all
seeing other people, right?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.858
She had this temper,
you know?

08:12.092 --> 08:15.829
Short fuse, runs in the family.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.197
There was this one time

08:17.197 --> 08:18.999
where Sparrow and I
were at Vitelli's.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.968
We ran into Mavis there.

08:20.968 --> 08:21.935
She was not pleased to see us.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.904
Defined not pleased.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.206
Well, she said to Sparrow,

08:26.206 --> 08:29.610
"Stay away from my boyfriend
or I'll kill you."

08:29.610 --> 08:31.511
And that amuses you, Colby,
the fact that

08:31.511 --> 08:33.113
you got caught out?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.415
What happened is horrible--

08:35.415 --> 08:36.584
horrible.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.021
I mean, I--

08:41.021 --> 08:42.656
I lost two of my sponsors.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.857
My phone keeps blowing up--

08:43.857 --> 08:45.458
Unlock your damn phone.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.360
Unlock it.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.940
All of these messages are from
women who wanna comfort him.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.142
Let me ask you something.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.078
Things ever get heated
between you and Mavis?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.947
I mean, you did say
she had a temper.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.882
You ever
have to defend yourself?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.784
If you're asking
if I ever hit Mavis,

09:10.784 --> 09:12.219
the answer is a resounding no.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.323
I was raised to cherish women.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.828
Plenty of them at once,
it seems.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.329
Hey.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.864
I didn't make them
fall in love with me.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.878
Hey.
Can you help me with this?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.847
Oh. Oh, my gosh.
You're bleeding.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.015
Come here. Sit down.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.291
Let me see.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.193
I will be gentle.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.528
Promise.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.033
Come here.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.940
Do you wanna tell me
about it, Mave?

10:06.940 --> 10:09.176
You wanna--what happened?

10:13.647 --> 10:17.084
I mean, you know
how Colby gets, um,

10:17.084 --> 10:19.119
when he wins, that high he has.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.721
I know. I've seen it.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.322
You combine that
with a couple tequila shots

10:22.322 --> 10:26.093
and he thinks
he can do anything.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.896
He did this to you?

10:28.896 --> 10:31.364
He came home after the bar,
and I--

10:31.364 --> 10:35.535
um, he, uh,
he came after me, and I--

10:35.535 --> 10:39.072
I--I tried
to fight him off and--

10:39.072 --> 10:43.176
You were lucky
to get out of there alive.

10:43.176 --> 10:47.815
But I have to ask, why don't
you just talk to the cops?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.216
No, I--

10:49.216 --> 10:51.018
Tell them about Colby
being so mean to you.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.720
Just clear everything up.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.554
No, I'm afraid.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.923
Of Colby?

10:55.923 --> 10:58.158
I'm afraid of Colby,
I'm afraid of the cops,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
I'm afraid of everybody.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.895
And it feels like a witch hunt.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.130
I gotcha.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.434
Just one second.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.571
Yeah?

11:11.571 --> 11:13.707
Okay.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.142
I'll be right there.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.978
That was work.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.247
I have to go deal
with something.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.382
You just sit tight here.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.318
No, I can't--
I can't just sit here.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.154
Just give me two seconds.
I'll be right back, okay?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.093
<i>I haven't seen her.</i>

11:33.093 --> 11:35.362
It's funny, your father
said the same thing.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.030
So you don't mind if we
check out your apartment

11:37.030 --> 11:38.331
then, right?
You live nearby?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.133
Sure, when you
show me a warrant.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.602
In the meantime,
I'm having a sale on wet suits.

11:42.602 --> 11:46.039
I mean, winter is
the best time for surfing.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.908
You surf?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.543
I'm no Laird Hamilton,
but dude, broski,

11:50.543 --> 11:53.546
there's some rad barrels
out there today.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.351
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.386
No way.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.054
Why aren't you
in Santa Clarita?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.589
Why are you in Vegas?

12:04.524 --> 12:08.428
Em McAdoo, segment producer
for "Wanted: America."

12:08.428 --> 12:10.898
Right.
And how do you know each other?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.299
Take it outside, all of you.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.701
No way am I talking
to you or the press.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.903
This is a witch hunt.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.404
You know,
my sister is innocent.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.072
I'm shocked
you still have your job.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.976
Please.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.177
All right, what'd she do?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.546
It's a long story.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.782
Remy.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.918
I think we should work
together again on this one.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.922
You know how helpful our show
can be in finding a fugitive.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.490
Your show that
sensationalizes tragedy.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.393
It's not a Lifetime show,
but I hear you.

12:42.695 --> 12:46.233
I know I need to reestablish
trust between us.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.668
Listen, the owner
of Queen's Beach Surf Shop

12:48.668 --> 12:50.971
saw Delilah's van leaving
her shop early this morning

12:50.971 --> 12:52.639
and returning
about an hour ago.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.174
It may be nothing,
but she may have gone

12:54.174 --> 12:55.475
to see her sister somewhere.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.878
Mavis probably
ditched her Polestar.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.046
Such a recognizable car?

12:59.046 --> 13:00.380
I would.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.215
How'd you get him to talk?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.251
My roommate from film school
has a cousin

13:04.251 --> 13:06.920
who waitresses here
in the summer.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.521
Hot white chick at large,

13:08.521 --> 13:10.790
people are gonna be
all over this one.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.292
And I'm the devil you know.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.895
Yeah, look, I've been
burned by the press before.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.098
Same. Me too. By you.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.100
I know.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.569
I can't change what happened.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.838
But it's up to you how you
want this one to play out.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.343
- Your number still the same?
- Remy?

13:30.343 --> 13:33.947
She's a tool we can use
to find Mavis.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.482
You'll share
everything with us?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.684
You won't hold anything back
for yourself like last time?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.887
For sure. Of course.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.721
As long as you don't
call me a tool again.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.226
I'll be in touch.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.729
Don't look at me like that.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.216
Mavis?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.618
I thought that was you.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.420
Hey.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.689
Your picture's
everywhere, girl.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.626
Something about
a murder in Philly?

14:19.626 --> 14:20.593
Yeah.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.729
Look, you didn't see me, okay?

14:22.729 --> 14:24.797
You're, uh,
standing right in front of me.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.835
We can keep it our secret.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.474
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

14:34.474 --> 14:37.010
Yeah. My name's Rodney.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.412
I'm here at Rockaway Beach,
and I'm with that girl that--

15:24.757 --> 15:26.059
The surfer's official
cause of death is drowning.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.794
The surfer's
cause of death is Mavis.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.262
I agree, but we have
no proof of that.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.398
No eyewitnesses
to his 911 call.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.366
Just an overwhelming
possibility that Mavis

15:33.366 --> 15:34.901
was in the vicinity
of his death.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.070
Three blocks
from her sister's surf shop?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.571
Possibility is not enough
for a warrant.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.840
But what is she doing surfing
when she's on the run?

15:40.840 --> 15:42.775
Right?
I'd call it delusional.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.277
And psychotic.

15:44.277 --> 15:48.081
Let's say Colby
traded in Mavis for Sparrow.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.783
Mavis is no longer the bright,
shining star she once was.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.852
It's infuriating
to be replaced.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.121
So where does that leave us?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.622
We still need a warrant.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.424
Without the murder weapon,
we need something definitive

15:57.424 --> 16:00.027
linking Mavis
to Sparrow's homicide.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.635
How do I look?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.770
Different. But that's good.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.742
Uncle Arnie.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.909
Did anybody see you?

16:16.909 --> 16:18.545
- No.
- Are you sure?

16:18.545 --> 16:19.979
Just relax.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.948
Nobody's gonna
connect us to this place.

16:21.948 --> 16:24.051
I gave Declan some money
to close early.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.853
He's a good guy,
he owes me one.

16:26.853 --> 16:29.256
So what'd you find out
down at the station?

16:29.256 --> 16:31.891
It's all the guys
are talking about.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.493
Colby let them
search your place,

16:33.493 --> 16:34.594
but they didn't find anything.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.962
'Cause there's
nothing to find.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.031
Nobody talks to the cops
or the Feds

16:38.031 --> 16:39.566
until we straighten
all this out.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.134
Everybody understand?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.769
Yeah.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.072
All right,
I've been thinking.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.107
You still have connections
from when you were teaching

16:47.107 --> 16:48.441
mindfulness down in Bali?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.942
Mm-hmm.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.744
We need to get you to Bali.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.912
How?

16:52.912 --> 16:55.648
My passport won't be any good.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.050
What can you do here?

16:57.050 --> 16:59.186
Surely you can do something.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.653
Me?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.189
Come on.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.993
Who do you know?

17:06.993 --> 17:10.063
Jimmy, I'm this close
to making detective, I--

17:10.063 --> 17:13.433
This is my daughter
we're talking about here!

17:13.433 --> 17:15.602
Your niece! Your family!

17:15.602 --> 17:17.036
Okay, okay!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.905
I think I know a guy
who can get her a passport.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.480
How long will that take?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.382
Three days.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.551
Get on it.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.453
But what are we supposed
to do for three days?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.788
We're going to Buffalo.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.790
We don't know anybody
in Buffalo.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.159
Exactly.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.274
Cut.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.543
Shay, can we cut the water?

17:56.543 --> 17:57.777
What's going on?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.078
Knife keeps slipping
out of my hand.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.447
That's the second time
that happened.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.648
Is your hand okay?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.049
Yeah, because
this blade's rubber.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.585
Hey, Em. Em.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.786
A good tip just came in.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.621
You're gonna wanna head
to Philly.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.190
Uh, gather round, everybody.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.159
Uh, that's it for the day.
Thank you very much.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.526
Em, can we talk, please?

18:17.164 --> 18:18.398
Hey, Em.
You're on speaker.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.432
Two things.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.733
One, in our reenactment,

18:20.733 --> 18:22.235
Sparrow's killer could have
cut her hand.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.238
Blood and water makes
for a very slippery situation.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.573
<i>What's the other thing?</i>

18:26.573 --> 18:28.040
Some guy from Philly
called in with footage

18:28.040 --> 18:29.509
from his Ring camera.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.544
<i>Says he can place
Mavis' Polestar</i>

18:31.544 --> 18:33.746
<i>eight blocks from Sparrow's
apartment the night she died.</i>

18:33.746 --> 18:35.114
Why didn't he call us?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.150
He wanted to try
and sell it and make a buck?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.685
- And what'd you do?
<i>- Bought it, of course.</i>

18:38.685 --> 18:40.687
I'll text you the address.
I'm headed there now.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.722
Do not touch or do anything.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.524
I know, Remy, I know.
Crime scene rules.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.625
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

18:48.195 --> 18:50.029
The friend proves useful
after all.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.465
I wouldn't say Em and I
are friends.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.601
So the Polestar
stops at the dumpster,

18:54.601 --> 18:59.672
which is right at the end
of the alley, which is there.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.073
Can we get a walk and talk

19:01.073 --> 19:03.576
with all of you
leading up to that?

19:03.576 --> 19:05.845
Come on, I kept my end
of the deal.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.547
Our audience needs
some context.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.716
I just give
and give and give.

19:09.716 --> 19:13.320
We're about eight blocks
from Sparrow May's apartment.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.388
Neighbors camera
picked up a Polestar

19:15.388 --> 19:20.026
coming down this alley
at 10:34 p.m.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.594
License plate's not visible,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.696
so we can't say for sure
it's Mavis' car.

19:23.696 --> 19:26.466
But the time is significant
because we believe

19:26.466 --> 19:28.535
Sparrow May died
around 10:00 p.m.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.503
Polestar stopped in front
of the dumpster,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.039
the driver seemingly
threw something in it.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.441
Was the murder weapon
ever recovered?

19:34.441 --> 19:37.310
Not yet, but this is where
I need you to stay back.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.746
We can't have you contaminating
a potential crime scene.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.147
For sure, of course.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.577
This matches the towels
in Sparrow May's bathroom.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.780
If Mavis cut her hand
and that's her blood

20:13.780 --> 20:16.549
on Sparrow's towel,

20:16.549 --> 20:19.218
that's our warrant,
and that's our case.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.955
<i>Delilah, what's going on?</i>

20:22.955 --> 20:24.591
They are in my place, Daddy.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.859
The police, the FBI,
they're searching everywhere.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.094
Why'd you let them in?

20:28.094 --> 20:30.463
They have a warrant.

20:30.463 --> 20:33.866
It-it says they're looking
for a knife.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.242
Kristin.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.679
There you go.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.249
They found something.
They're coming.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.486
Daddy?

20:56.723 --> 20:58.190
You wanna tell us
why this knife roll

20:58.190 --> 21:00.760
was in the toilet tank?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.062
I-I don't know.
I've never seen that before.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.264
It has
your sister's name on it.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.067
Was she here?

21:08.067 --> 21:09.569
Who were you just talking to?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.137
Nobody.

21:11.137 --> 21:14.006
Listen, Delilah,
we found your sister's car

21:14.006 --> 21:15.708
with blood in it.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.477
If you're helping her, it's
called accessory to murder.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.011
Do you understand that?
- Lawyer.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.414
I-I want to talk to a lawyer.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.083
That's what I thought.
Okay, you're under arrest.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.923
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.627
Dad, Dad, whatever
they found, it wasn't mine--

21:34.627 --> 21:35.628
Just stop!

21:42.101 --> 21:43.570
Daddy, please.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.805
I'm sorry.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.374
I need you to believe me.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.808
You're my daughter, Mavis.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.110
Doesn't matter what I believe.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.846
But I'm gonna protect you
no matter what.

21:56.349 --> 22:00.219
Sometimes you just make
some bad choices, is all.

22:00.219 --> 22:02.121
Like dating Colby?

22:02.121 --> 22:03.890
And who was that woman
you were with?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.091
What was her name, Leah?

22:05.091 --> 22:08.495
- Yeah, Leah.
- Oh yeah, oh.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.731
You just let your emotions
get the best of you.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.467
And I know, I do it too.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.971
We just gotta weather
the storm is all, okay?

22:18.971 --> 22:19.939
We're gonna make it through.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.641
Okay.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.810
But I don't think
going to Buffalo

22:23.810 --> 22:26.212
is a good idea anymore.

22:26.212 --> 22:30.149
We need somewhere
off the beaten path.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.921
I know where we can go.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.598
You sure you don't want me
to drive you there?

22:45.598 --> 22:46.933
The weather's changing.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.669
Dad, there's no road.
It's okay. I'll be fine.

22:49.669 --> 22:50.937
All right.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.072
This is a burner.
It's all ready.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.742
You need anything, you call me.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.944
Okay.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.946
You sure that cabin's
up there?

22:59.946 --> 23:01.313
Yeah. It's a hostel, Dad.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.915
I stay there
when I hike the trail,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.117
and it's closed for the season.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.352
It's okay.
- All right.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.687
I'll pick you up
in Gorham in two days.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.288
Okay.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.462
<i>Om namah shivaya.</i>

23:15.462 --> 23:17.797
Is that Bali-speak?

23:17.797 --> 23:21.768
It's a prayer for peace.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.736
Thank you for everything.

23:30.710 --> 23:31.911
Love you.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.528
Okay, so we've got her
on a no-fly list,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.129
so she can't leave the country.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.398
We're up on her credit cards,
we've got her family covered.

23:52.398 --> 23:53.933
So where does she go?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.202
Some place she knows,
she's familiar with.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.470
Well,
she's got survival skills.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.838
She's in great shape, right?

23:58.838 --> 24:01.073
Maybe she's hiding out
till everything dies down.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.876
Mavis hiked
the Appalachian Trail,

24:03.876 --> 24:06.045
some kind
of "Eat, Pray, Love" thing.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.580
Come on, guys--
the Appalachian trail's

24:07.580 --> 24:08.848
over 2000 miles.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.149
That's a lot of real estate.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.852
Well, she focused
on the greatest hits.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.054
Mount Moosilauke
and Mount Killington.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.790
She made it to the end
of the trail in Maine.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.193
That only narrows it down
to 500 miles.

25:25.558 --> 25:26.525
Hi.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.896
I need your help.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.265
All right, thank you.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.835
James Kennedy's Ford went
through the Everett Turnpike

25:35.835 --> 25:37.904
in New Hampshire an hour ago.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.740
The Appalachian Trail
approaches I-93

25:40.740 --> 25:43.576
about 70 minutes from where
the Ford was spotted.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.845
Beaver Brook Trailhead.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.046
Call the locals
and get them there.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.480
Let's hit the tarmac.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.916
There's a big storm
about to hit New Hampshire.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.818
I don't know
if we'll be able to land.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.486
So we better hurry.
It's all we got.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.732
You came.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.635
You're all over the news.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.803
How do I look?

26:10.803 --> 26:13.372
You haven't changed.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.475
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.358
Captain Wyatt.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.562
BOLO went out for James
Kennedy right after we spoke.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.064
Good.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.232
We got Patrol in Connecticut
and Massachusetts on I-91.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.701
This is where we are.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.670
This juncture has four possible
paths that can be taken,

26:43.670 --> 26:44.904
one in each direction.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.538
If Mavis stayed along the AT,

26:46.538 --> 26:48.407
she went either south
toward Mount Moosilauke

26:48.407 --> 26:50.843
or north toward River Mountain.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.244
She's got
a five-hour lead on us?

26:52.244 --> 26:54.513
Let's say she's traveling
five miles an hour.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.382
That gives us
a search radius of--

26:56.382 --> 26:58.050
25 miles.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.385
She'll likely seek shelter.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.620
We've marked the possible
cabins and hostels

27:01.620 --> 27:03.122
where she could be.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.958
My choppers can't take off
in this visibility.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.994
So the only way
to get there is on foot?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.662
We don't have
much light left, either.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.132
Gear up and fan out.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.675
What are you doing here?

27:22.675 --> 27:24.844
My camera stopped working
because of the cold.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.513
- Where's Em?
- She's up ahead a little bit.

27:27.513 --> 27:28.748
I was heading back
to the command post,

27:28.748 --> 27:30.182
but I might be a little lost.

27:30.182 --> 27:32.551
Do I take a left or a right
up the fork?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.887
I'm good here.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.555
Get Barry Jenkins out of here.

27:41.761 --> 27:42.594
Em?

27:45.164 --> 27:46.733
You're here.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.567
I could almost hug you.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.937
You okay?
You scared the hell out of me.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.238
I think so.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.841
I can't feel my feet,
but otherwise good.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.976
What happened to giving me
a heads-up?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.045
I found this on a subreddit.
I knew it was a long shot.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.847
I didn't wanna wild goose you.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.248
<i>Remy!</i>

28:02.248 --> 28:03.682
Yeah, I'm here with McAdoo.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.917
This is bad.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.753
The temperature's
just dropped 20 degrees

28:06.753 --> 28:08.187
in the last half hour.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.688
Any evidence of Mavis?

28:09.688 --> 28:11.390
Nothing so far.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.458
Right.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.360
How about you and Hana?

28:14.360 --> 28:16.395
The storm's getting worse.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.764
Yeah, it's coming in fast.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.331
It's getting dark too.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.967
Remy, look. There's huts.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.671
We're gonna
check out these huts.

28:25.671 --> 28:27.406
I'm calling the search off.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.041
<i>Meet back at the command post.</i>

28:29.041 --> 28:31.811
Okay. Okay, let's go.
Move out.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.082
This is the last hut.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.152
She's not here.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.453
Go in and get warm.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.195
<i>Are you okay out there?</i>

28:49.195 --> 28:51.798
Storm's right over us.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.400
Have to wait
till it passes and take cover.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.434
You sure?

28:55.434 --> 28:56.568
We're three miles in.

28:56.568 --> 28:58.237
We'll never make it back.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.671
It's our only option.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.996
Hey.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.698
Nurse Leah at your service.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.436
Lucky me.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.972
I'm the lucky one.

29:32.972 --> 29:37.977
When you called, it was like
God answering my prayers.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.979
Ow! Ah!

29:39.979 --> 29:41.613
Oh.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.714
Here.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.083
Let me give you this for pain.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.122
There.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.030
Good.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.699
Okay.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.734
Ah!

30:02.734 --> 30:06.238
Hey, um, look, I'm sorry.

30:06.238 --> 30:10.676
I'm sorry for the way
that things ended between us.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.481
Things ended?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.750
That, my dear,
is abdicating responsibility.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.686
You ended our relationship.

30:22.688 --> 30:25.191
You ended our marriage.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.526
Broke my heart.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.229
Ow! Ah!

30:34.733 --> 30:37.003
What's going on?

30:37.003 --> 30:40.306
I'm never
letting you go again.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.051
Impressive.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.253
I never would have
taken you for a Boy Scout.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.989
Don't tell anyone,
but I still have my uniform.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.991
Anything to eat in there?

30:58.991 --> 31:01.593
Got an energy bar,
the kind that sponsored Colby,

31:01.593 --> 31:04.130
and some butter rum
Life Savers.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.698
Mm-hmm? Mmm-mmm.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.400
- Oh. Dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.370
No nicotine gum, but it'll do.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.039
Look at this.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.206
Nice.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.775
<i>Remy, Em?</i>

31:20.279 --> 31:21.413
Go for Remy.

31:21.413 --> 31:22.648
Just checking
you're still alive.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.183
Yeah.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.152
Everything's good here. Right?

31:26.152 --> 31:29.455
Look, before Colby,
and I mean long before,

31:29.455 --> 31:32.124
Mavis was in a pretty serious
relationship with a woman.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.493
<i>In fact, they were married.</i>

31:34.493 --> 31:36.929
She must've deleted that
from her social media.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.664
Her name is Leah Wilson.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.732
She's a nurse in Maine now.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.168
It looks like
they were trying to open

31:42.168 --> 31:44.070
<i>a wellness center together.</i>

31:44.070 --> 31:46.772
This case just gets
better and better.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.307
Do we have
a location on Leah?

31:48.307 --> 31:50.042
Well, she's not at her home,
but the police say

31:50.042 --> 31:51.743
it looks like she left
in a hurry.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.413
<i>I've got a BOLO out and I'm
trying to track her phone now.</i>

31:54.413 --> 31:56.315
Find out if Leah
has any connection

31:56.315 --> 31:57.516
to the Appalachian Trail.

31:57.516 --> 31:58.684
Will do.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.987
<i>Stay warm, you two.</i>

32:03.922 --> 32:05.992
Almost eight hours till dawn.

32:05.992 --> 32:08.794
I'm sure we can think
of something to do.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.502
You're someone who's always
trying to take what they can.

32:16.502 --> 32:19.538
Like when you're at the grocery
store doing self-checkout,

32:19.538 --> 32:21.907
you always slip a few things
into your bag gratis.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.875
- I don't do that.
- I've seen you--

32:26.178 --> 32:28.847
I've seen you do it.

32:28.847 --> 32:31.917
And when you met Colby,

32:31.917 --> 32:33.552
suddenly you're into men?

32:33.552 --> 32:35.187
Into triathlons?

32:35.187 --> 32:36.655
How cool.

32:36.655 --> 32:40.159
You saw an opportunity
for a new life and a new brand

32:40.159 --> 32:42.461
with Colby, and you took it.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.764
Thought you were trading up.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.434
I'm sorry, Leah.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.403
But when Colby traded up
for that young, pretty thing,

32:51.403 --> 32:53.805
you couldn't stand it.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.009
I don't blame you.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.579
I know exactly how it feels.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.517
Colby did to you
exactly what you did to me.

33:08.587 --> 33:12.924
But now we have
a golden opportunity

33:12.924 --> 33:15.427
to right the wrongs
of the past.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.030
Tell me, did you call me
because you needed help

33:18.030 --> 33:22.068
or because you wanted to make
things right between us?

33:23.435 --> 33:24.403
Leah.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.840
I--ah! Ah!

33:28.840 --> 33:30.976
Yes! Yes! I did. I'm sorry.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.479
I wanna make things right.
I do. I really do.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.514
- You do?
- Yes.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.516
I do.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.884
Good.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.296
<i>You know, we're not
so different, you and me.</i>

33:50.296 --> 33:52.198
Murder's our business.
- No, my business.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.366
Yours is reenactments.
A little different.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.034
We're both after
the same thing.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.204
I mean, here we are.

33:58.204 --> 34:02.441
Yeah, Ritz-Carlton
of the Appalachian Trail.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.976
Beautiful.

34:04.976 --> 34:07.679
We live for this.

34:07.679 --> 34:11.217
Nothing beats that feeling when
the phone rings with a case

34:11.217 --> 34:14.286
and that thrill of what's next.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.989
Why'd you burn me on Vegas?

34:20.092 --> 34:21.927
When the tip came out
on Woolard?

34:23.462 --> 34:25.564
You went to his house
without me.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.065
Why?

34:27.065 --> 34:30.669
I never thought
he'd take off the way he did.

34:30.669 --> 34:34.173
And kill someone else.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.175
You put yourself first, Em.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.510
I made a mistake.

34:38.510 --> 34:41.847
I apologized to the family,
I asked for forgiveness.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.750
What else can I do, Remy?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.852
We can't keep going back.

34:49.121 --> 34:52.758
To be fair, the way he
got away with the drainpipe--

34:52.758 --> 34:56.662
no one, not you, not me,
knew the entrance was there.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.130
Same thing probably
would have happened

34:58.130 --> 35:00.366
if we got in there first.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.506
Thank you for saying that.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.742
And we would've never gotten
that warrant without you.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.778
I know.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.981
See, you do need me after all.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.684
I do.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.954
Your hands are freezing, here.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.557
Let's try this.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.694
It's one way to warm up.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.600
There it is.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.670
What?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.039
That feeling.

35:41.039 --> 35:43.175
What's next,
what's next, what's next?

35:54.085 --> 35:56.222
Glad to see
you survived the night.

35:56.222 --> 35:58.724
- So not an outdoors person.
- I was worried about you.

35:58.724 --> 35:59.958
What's the latest
and greatest?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.660
Mavis' ex, Leah,
her Subaru was found

36:01.660 --> 36:03.161
at the Glencliff Trailhead
parking lot.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.696
That's the other side
of the mountain.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.498
On this trail,
like six miles away.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.599
Both Kristin and Hana
are there now,

36:07.599 --> 36:08.900
making their way toward us.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.736
And Leah and Mavis
are somewhere in between.

36:10.736 --> 36:13.171
- You good?
- I need you two to stay back.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.940
- What?
- Too dangerous.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.975
Leah could be armed.
I don't want you getting hurt.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.311
I'm okay with getting hurt as
long as we get great footage.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.548
Sorry, no. Let's go.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.615
Let's go!

36:23.615 --> 36:25.451
You two, stay here.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.963
All right, open wide.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.404
Mmm, mmm.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.273
Can I have some coffee?

36:47.273 --> 36:48.274
Sure.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.824
Ooh!
It's hot.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.659
Let me blow on it
for you a little.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.644
Come on.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.182
Yeah.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.258
We're coming up
on a cluster of cabins.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.861
I count three.
- Any sign of Mavis or Leah?

37:42.861 --> 37:44.296
Not that we know of so far.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.966
I've got something.

37:47.966 --> 37:50.436
I think it's Mavis.
She's gone off the trail.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.703
- Fan out.
- Spread out!

37:51.703 --> 37:52.804
What direction?

37:52.804 --> 37:54.306
North by northeast.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.374
Don't lose her.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.982
Over there!

38:06.251 --> 38:08.019
It's Leah.
She's got a rifle.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.624
Help!

38:17.829 --> 38:20.932
Oh!

38:20.932 --> 38:22.968
Drop your weapon, Leah.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.736
Drop it!

38:30.275 --> 38:31.209
Leah's down.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.046
- Hands up!
- Hands where I can see them.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.283
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:38.283 --> 38:39.718
Hands behind your back,
thumbs up.

38:39.718 --> 38:40.986
Let's go.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.021
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:46.057 --> 38:49.227
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

38:49.227 --> 38:52.063
I didn't mean to.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.805
<i>We can't have you contaminating</i>

38:59.805 --> 39:01.373
<i>a potential crime scene.</i>

39:03.509 --> 39:06.745
So this, uh, Remy guy.

39:06.745 --> 39:10.148
It's good TV.
- He knows it too.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.117
You've got a good thing
with him now.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.219
Don't do anything stupid
and mess it up.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.321
We need an open line
of communication.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.256
Remember that whole
"tread lightly" thing?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.994
Em?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.996
Em, you hear me on this?

39:24.996 --> 39:27.399
Yeah, of course.
Tread lightly.

39:27.399 --> 39:28.934
I gotta go.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.438
Hey.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.940
How do you feel about pizza?

39:34.940 --> 39:36.808
How is it you only
been here a few weeks

39:36.808 --> 39:38.143
and you already know Carlo?

39:38.143 --> 39:40.812
I've never gotten
into Roberta's that fast.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.414
Cameraman Joe knows him.

39:42.414 --> 39:43.815
That dude.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.086
That's my place.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.857
Bet it has a nice view.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.124
I'd invite you up...

39:53.124 --> 39:55.427
And I'd probably say yes.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.802
I have an early
call time tomorrow.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.971
Mm.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.443
What are you afraid of?

40:16.782 --> 40:21.386
Um, everything?

40:23.655 --> 40:25.190
Making a mistake.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.395
Me too.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.267
You know, there's a real
upside to being who we are.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.004
Compartmentalized
and cut off from our feelings?

40:39.004 --> 40:42.007
No attachments, no kids,
make our own rules,

40:42.007 --> 40:44.843
do whatever we want.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.479
- I like the sound of that.
- Mm-hmm.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.462
Maybe this is the beginning
of a beautiful,

41:04.462 --> 41:06.898
sexy,

41:06.898 --> 41:09.935
hot friendship.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.605
I'm good with that.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.146
Go get 'em, kid.
