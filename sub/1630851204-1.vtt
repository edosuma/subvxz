-- This programme contains
strong language and scenes some
viewers may find distressing

00:11.440 --> 00:14.040
Being a carer is all about...

00:18.360 --> 00:22.880
..acknowledging and, you know,
preserving the residents' dignity.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.160
You know, I've been told,
I've been told before

00:27.200 --> 00:29.800
that I'm very good at making people
feel comfortable.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.920
Very, you know, I'm very social,

00:34.960 --> 00:39.240
very sociable person,
very personable,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.400
very personable...

00:42.800 --> 00:44.280
..very personable.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.720
Like to have a laugh, like to go...
like to have a

00:49.760 --> 00:52.000
Don't say you like have laugh.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
She's not your mate.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.480
Ow!

01:11.480 --> 01:16.520

02:12.000 --> 02:13.640
WHISPERING: -- Follow me. Be quick.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
Go on, then.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.640
We've been given the honour

02:28.680 --> 02:30.600
of getting tea and that
for the candidate.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.080
-- You're the only candidate.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.160
-- Er, tea, please, yeah.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.400
Ta.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.760
-- Milk and sugar?
--One and a half, please.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.920
-- You mean two.
--No, she means one and a half.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.760
-- That's not a number, is it?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.560
-- Well, it is a number,
it's one and a half.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.440
I'm sorry. He's rude.

02:52.480 --> 02:53.880
I'm Tony, by the way.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.240
He's Kenny.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.960
-- After Kenny Dalglish, easy.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.640
Where he's named after milkman
his mum used to play dominoes with.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.400
-- Ask him how old he is, ask him when
Dalglish made his debut.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.320
-- My dad was a fortune teller.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.520
A point to me. -- Tit.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.600
-- Sarah, is it? -- Yeah.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.800
-- Thank you, lads.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.560
So what brings you
to residential care?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.960
-- Well, I've got me Level 1

03:31.000 --> 03:34.200
in Preparing to Work in Adult Social
Care... -- Going to stop you there.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.160
This job is about treating
people with dignity.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.080
-- Of course.
--This is their home that we work in.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.200
So I'm not just employing any old
knobby-knobstopper to wipe an arse.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
-- Have I upset you?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.880
-- You sent your CV and,
well, your skills are joking

03:50.920 --> 03:52.480
and your work's not much better.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.320
-- You know, I just... I haven't found
a good fit,

03:57.360 --> 03:59.000
and I think,
given the opportunity...

03:59.040 --> 04:01.680
-- You think 53 hours of your Level 1
makes you ready for this?

04:03.520 --> 04:06.120
-- Did I say that? -- Cos you
might be trusted to pull a pint,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.640
but sitting with a scared old man
while he's trying to work out

04:08.680 --> 04:11.200
what a fork is...
--All right, Alan Sugar!

04:11.240 --> 04:13.320
Yeah, you see me,
but I see you as well.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.200
-- Do you know how many people... -- You
came in here absolutely certain...

04:16.240 --> 04:18.440
-- ..with this precious Level 1...
--..I was a waste of time.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.360
-- ..and they last no more than I week.
--Well, I won't even last that long.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.160
Stick your job.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.920
Do you know, me grandad had
Alzheimer's and I was only young,

04:27.960 --> 04:30.920
but I remember...I remember singing
and dancing with him and I thought,

04:30.960 --> 04:33.400
"Do you know, if I can help someone
else like that,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.120
"maybe I'll feel less like shit."

04:35.160 --> 04:37.240
So I understand dignity.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.720
But from the way that you've carried
on, I'm not sure that you do.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.120
-- You'll do fine.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.080
You can start Monday. -- Whatever.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.400
-- I was baiting you.

-- Stop!

05:10.120 --> 05:11.200
You wanted tea.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.000
I'm not supposed to be out
here unsupervised,

05:17.040 --> 05:20.040
but I learnt the door code

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
and I wrote it down.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.600
-- OK. -- They'll change the code now.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.560
That's all right. I'll risk that.

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
Cos I like you.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.960
-- WHISPERS: Fucking hell.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.880
-- Tony!

05:37.920 --> 05:39.040
Tony, come on, lad.

05:40.520 --> 05:41.560
In!

05:43.680 --> 05:44.800
-- Ta-ra.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.920
-- I'll see you Monday.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.080
-- So?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.360
-- I got it.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.080
-- Look at you! -- What's that screaming?
--She got the job, Bob.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.520
-- I'll give her five minutes before
she fucks it. -- Bob, don't.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.200
-- I say it, you think it.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.080
-- I won't mess up, not this time.
--Did you take the car? -- Yeah.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.080
-- She took the car today. It's my
turn. -- Well, she had her interview.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.480
-- Doesn't mean she can take my keys.
--I paid for the car.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.160
-- Car's for all the family.
Messed up there, didn't you?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.600
-- And what did you do today, Dad, eh?

06:32.640 --> 06:35.320
Did you scratch your right bollock
or left? -- I see you...

06:36.400 --> 06:37.840
..even if she doesn't.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.440
-- DOOR ENTRY BUZZES

06:51.800 --> 06:54.160
-- Hello, love. You having a sad day?

06:56.720 --> 06:57.880
-- Thelma?

06:58.920 --> 07:00.920
Are you all right?
Where are you going?

-- TV ON

QUIET CONVERSATION

07:29.320 --> 07:31.040
-- You get nothing.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.640
-- Don't I now?

07:33.680 --> 07:36.280
-- Bill's just delivering the post,
if you'll excuse us? -- Yeah.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.280
-- Nothing for her. -- No, love, not yet.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.400
-- Any for me, Bill?

07:43.600 --> 07:45.440
I'll take that as a no.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.800
Follow me to the office, please.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.360
So what we have here
is a one week induction...

07:54.040 --> 07:57.120
..with two days training
on the floor.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.880
The first six weeks of probationary
but I'll do my best by you.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.760
Nights, you know,
they're generally OK.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.840
I've switched my shifts
so I can be doing your induction,

08:07.880 --> 08:10.800
so it's all joined up.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.520
Right, uniform.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.680
Me mum chose the colour.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.800
Used to be hers, all this. -- OK.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.880
-- I think it makes it look like you
work in a tuck shop

08:23.920 --> 08:26.680
or on Play School or whatever shit
they watch these days,

08:26.720 --> 08:27.880
I haven't got kids.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.720
I'll let you get changed, then,
and when I come back,

08:31.760 --> 08:34.000

Hello, my name's Steve Frobisher.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.840
I'm calling from
Bright Sky Care Home.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.000
One of our residents
has gone missing.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.480
His name is Tony Connell.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.560
He's 47 years old.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.320
He has young onset Alzheimer's.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.240
Jeans and a blue jacket, I think.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.280
Well, he hasn't been seen since tea.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.760
Yeah, thank you. All right.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.920
Well, someone will be here to answer
this number.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.960
-- CLICKS FINGERS
--OK, thank you. OK, thank you. Bye.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.200
You with me now. -- But... -- Come on.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.880
-- Ooh!

10:00.920 --> 10:03.960
-- I know where he'll probably be -
he'll have gone to his mum's.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.680
Have you got this?
Cos I need her with me.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.240
-- Well, there's only two of us.
Are you kidding? -- We'll be quick.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.440
-- My feet hurt.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.280
-- Oh, that's because you've been
walking over my heart all day, pal.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.880
Come on, let's have a sit-down.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.920
-- You'll know her...

10:21.360 --> 10:22.520
..by her foot

10:22.560 --> 10:25.360
The smallest gamboge hand

10:25.400 --> 10:29.120
Fingers where the toes should be

10:29.160 --> 10:30.920
Would more affront the sand.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.040
-- That's beautiful.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.400
This is his route.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.600
I can't watch for him, you can,
both windows.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.000
You remember his face, right?

10:38.040 --> 10:40.320
-- He's a bit young, isn't he,
for all this?

10:40.360 --> 10:42.000
-- It happens more than you think,
you know.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.960
Probably been ill for a while with
the Alzheimer's,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.720
but his mum was masking it.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.880
Anyway, she dies and he sets fire
to the back kitchen,

10:50.920 --> 10:53.720
ends up walking down the
street half naked. -- Shit.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.160
-- Police pick him up and he's like,
"Don't touch me, don't touch me!"

10:57.200 --> 10:59.040
You know the sort of thing? -- No.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.400
-- A few evaluations later and a brain
scan or two and he moves in with us.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.800
He's a lovely fellow...

11:05.960 --> 11:08.000
..but can't keep him still for
love nor money.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.080
-- There.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.240
There he is.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.200
There. -- Good girl, good girl.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.720
-- INDICATOR CLICKS

11:26.800 --> 11:29.240
-- Tony, come on, mate. -- Get your
fucking hands off me, will ya?!

11:29.280 --> 11:31.280
-- Tony, come on. You're going
to get me into trouble

11:31.320 --> 11:32.920
with the police again
like last time.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.160
-- Who the fuck are you to talk
to me like that? -- Tony...

11:35.200 --> 11:37.560
You're just confused, mate.
--Do you want to go? -- Come on.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.720
It's only Steve.
--I was expecting a big hello here

11:39.760 --> 11:41.800
and this is what you do.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.280
-- I've got to get back to me ma.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.640
She needs me.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.600
She worries about me
when I'm not there.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.520
-- Why, were you a naughty boy at
school, was you?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.840
-- Sometimes, yeah. -- Oh, she had a right
to worry, then, didn't she?

12:09.920 --> 12:10.920
SHE CHUCKLES

12:13.400 --> 12:15.480
-- Well, do you want to come back
to ours?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.000
Me ma makes the best scouse
in the world.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.800
-- Oh, I love scouse,
especially with a load of HP.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.400
Can you tell me her recipe?

12:28.680 --> 12:29.760
-- No, she'd rather die.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.680
She is dead, isn't she?

12:48.200 --> 12:49.200
-- HE SNIFFLES

12:49.240 --> 12:51.040
-- I forgot me ma was dead.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.560
-- We're going to take you home, Tony.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.920
-- I'm going home. -- Somebody else
lives there now, Tony.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.400
The council, they've given that to
someone else.

13:04.440 --> 13:08.760
-- You have a bed in a home with us -
Bright Sky Homes, do you remember?

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
Bright Sky.

You all right? -- Oh, hey.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.720
So, we've got six breakfasts due,
and we're behind on feeds.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.640
-- How did we get behind on feeds?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.160
-- Needed a hand with the
meds order. We're behind.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.000
Seniors are behind, we're behind.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.320
Do you want to make a start
on Gloria's pad change?

about that, actually.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.360
-- About my bits? -- No!

15:06.400 --> 15:08.280

Now, there's this little boy called
Liam, and he goes downstairs

15:13.760 --> 15:16.480

asks his dad for a cup of water...

15:16.520 --> 15:17.880
-- Oh, they do that.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.840
-- And his dad says,
"Jesus, Liam, that's the 15th one

15:20.880 --> 15:22.360
"you've asked for tonight."

15:22.400 --> 15:24.440
-- Oh, it's difficult
when they won't asleep.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.400
-- And he says,
"I know it's the 15th, Dad,

15:26.440 --> 15:28.640
"but me room's still on fire."

15:34.560 --> 15:36.480
It's not a great joke.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.520
Are you ready for me
to start downstairs now?

19:58.840 --> 20:00.760
-- It's a simple game, really.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.760
You deal three card blind,
three cards facing,

20:03.800 --> 20:06.600
and you get three cards
in your hand.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.560
Right, the aim of the game is to
get rid of all your cards.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.520
Yeah? -- OK.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.000
-- Highest card wins.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.240
If you can't go higher,
then you pick up from the pile.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.440
Only cards that'll do you
different is two - which means

20:20.480 --> 20:22.560
you start again from two
- or seven.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.000
If I play a seven,
you have to play lower then.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.520
Or a ten, which is like a magic
card, a ten clears the whole pile.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.240
Capishe?
--How do you remember all of that?

20:32.280 --> 20:35.240

Yeah, we'll pick up as we go along.

-- Well, when my dad left,
it was just me and Aunt Trisha.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.960
We had to look after me mum.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.600
That was hard.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.640
Some days it was really messy.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.880
And then after that doctor gave her
her tablets, then...

21:10.640 --> 21:12.600
..she never left the couch.

21:16.160 --> 21:21.440

didn't get me anything.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.680
No presents.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.320

she weren't going to get shit."

the time, so...

21:36.680 --> 21:39.280
Oh, it's a pupil referral unit.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.200
It's...it's basically where
they put kids no school wants.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.920
No! But I was 12!

21:45.960 --> 21:48.200
Do you know what I mean? I was...

21:48.240 --> 21:51.240
I think all 12-year-olds should
get presents. Don't you?

21:51.280 --> 21:54.480
-- Yeah. -- Yeah, well, the worst thing
was me mum went along with it.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.960
She's just as bad.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.080
-- So you were a proper bad girl, then?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.000
-- "Proper bad girl."

22:00.040 --> 22:02.840
I did some damage.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.880
-- Primary school,
I'd lost me bouncy ball,

22:05.920 --> 22:09.040
and the teacher couldn't find it,
so I smashed every single light

22:09.080 --> 22:12.160
in the classroom and got
suspended for two weeks.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.720
-- Oh, school disco, Sonia Sherbet.

22:14.760 --> 22:19.000
Well, she called me a slag
because I had boobs before her.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.200
So I broke her nose.

and me, erm...

22:33.200 --> 22:35.600
-- Pen. -- Pen, yeah, yeah.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.040
So, erm... So he said
to me I was too late

22:39.080 --> 22:41.680
and he'd given them all out, so...
I knocked him out.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.920
I didn't get no GCSE though.
--Neither did I.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.480

off the caretaker,

22:51.520 --> 22:53.480
and I let these mates of mine in...

22:54.680 --> 22:57.920
..and they cleared out every
computer they could find.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.440
Yeah. They didn't know it was me.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.320
Otherwise I probably would've
been sent away. -- Yeah.

23:03.360 --> 23:07.080
-- But I think the caretaker knew, but
he didn't say anything, because...

23:07.120 --> 23:09.960
Well, I mean, me mate was
sucking him off at the time.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.440
-- Hiya, Stan.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.000
-- Where's your mask?

28:08.880 --> 28:10.840
-- Uh, I didn't knew we needed
to wear them.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.760
-- Who's your manager?
--I'm the manager.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.440
No masks unless you're around the
infection, that's what we were told.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.840
He's been tested, right?
He's all clear?

28:17.880 --> 28:21.160
-- It's above my station, that.
Shall we get him in?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.200
I've got five others
to deliver today.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.240
-- Yeah, let's get you somewhere
comfortable, shall we, Stan?

28:37.040 --> 28:39.960
RADIO BEEPS

28:48.000 --> 28:52.240
-- Right, I need to talk to you all
about Covid-19 protocols.

28:52.280 --> 28:55.480
-- We need more PPE. -- Let's not start
out all aggressively, shall we?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.640
-- We've got a box of this
and a box of that

28:57.680 --> 28:59.720
but mostly we've got a box
of eff all.

28:59.760 --> 29:03.240
-- Look, I am trying. I drove around
every bloody chemist yesterday,

29:03.280 --> 29:05.480
every one in the best part
of Merseyside.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.000
I couldn't get masks, I couldn't get
alcohol wipes, couldn't get nothing.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.000
And PHE don't give a shit. -- No,
it's rationing, pure and simple.

29:12.040 --> 29:15.480
They want to protect the NHS
and care homes can just go to hell.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.000
-- The guidance is face masks
should only be worn

29:18.040 --> 29:20.240
when within two metres
of the infected

29:20.280 --> 29:24.480
and we don't have any infected yet
so we don't need to wear them, OK?

29:24.520 --> 29:28.000
Cleaning - when in doubt, scrub with
every disinfectant you can find.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.000
And residents are to be fed in
their rooms exclusively from now on.

29:32.040 --> 29:35.080
-- Where are we supposed to find time
for that? -- The priority has to be

29:35.120 --> 29:38.000
keeping the residents apart,
so we have to do a lockdown

29:38.040 --> 29:40.720
inside the home.
--But we carry it between them.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.640
-- Then we have to be dead careful
not to carry it between them.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.480
As soon as we know there's a case,
barrier nursing, OK?

29:46.520 --> 29:48.320
Washing hands, erm...

29:48.360 --> 29:53.000
Happy Birthday twice, or two verses
of Ferry Cross The Mersey.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.480
-- New masks, new aprons?
Oh, no, we can't do that, can we?

29:56.520 --> 29:59.000
-- And I'm banning visits.
--What? -- Just till we know.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.880
-- Hold on, there's no advice on that.
--No, that's me.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.880
I'm saying it's happening,
for the sake of everyone here.

30:04.920 --> 30:08.080
-- What about Bill? He sleeps in the
lounge. What am I supposed to do?

30:08.120 --> 30:10.400
-- Tell him to sleep in his
own bloody bed for once.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.640
One last thing, the laundry service
have said that they can only do half

30:13.680 --> 30:15.480
of what they did before
so can we please

30:15.520 --> 30:18.080
try and keep the sheets on the beds
a little bit longer.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.000
-- Oh, Steve, come on. If people
are sick they need new sheets.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.160
Do they not know that?
--It's Covid protocol.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.480
It's there to keep their
staff apart. It's...

30:25.520 --> 30:28.680
I don't know. It's annoying.
It's all just annoying.

30:28.720 --> 30:32.720
From midday we implement, OK?
And I will find you your PPE.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.480
-- REPORTER: -- There have been
92 care homes

30:38.520 --> 30:40.480
where an outbreak has been detected.

30:40.520 --> 30:43.400
One of the things we want to do
is to extend the amount

30:43.440 --> 30:47.480
of testing of people in care homes
and the ability to test...

30:47.520 --> 30:49.240
-- Where have you been?

30:50.280 --> 30:52.480
-- Out. Why? Looking to grass me up
are you?

30:52.520 --> 30:54.280
-- You're not supposed to be going out.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.040
-- You can cut the holier than thou
crap. You're going to work.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.240
-- I'm supposed to be in work.
I'm needed in work.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.000
-- Yeah, and they've all got it,
and you're bringing it here,

31:02.040 --> 31:05.160
so what's the problem? -- Because your
divvy mates could infect you,

31:05.200 --> 31:08.040
which could infect me, which
could then infect my residents.

31:08.080 --> 31:11.480
-- It's such shit. I'm young. I need to
live my life - do something with it.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.440
-- Yeah, you're really doing something
with your life, aren't you?

31:14.480 --> 31:17.000
-- Hey, hey, hey.
You sound like your dad.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.000
-- It's her, saying I can't go out.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.480
-- If he infects me
and then I infect them.

31:21.520 --> 31:23.800
-- Well, there's a solution to that,
isn't there?

31:24.840 --> 31:26.720
Don't look at me like that.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.800
We've coped without your wage
before, we can cope again.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.000
Come on now. -- I like it, Mum.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.480
Actually, I'm good at it.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.720
I'll get you fed as soon as I can.
--I don't want to be fed.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.000
I want to watch telly.
--The lounge is closed.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.000
I need to get all these dinners out.

32:12.040 --> 32:15.360
Can we get you in here? I'll get
your tray and bring it in for you.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.400
-- I need to come in.
--You can't be here right now.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.880
-- I'm not leaving my dad in there
knowing what's going on.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.640
-- We'll sort something out, OK?
--I need to see him now. Let us in.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.640
-- Maybe you can talk to him
through the window.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.320
It's for the best for everyone.
--It's not for me, is it, Steve?

32:27.360 --> 32:30.240
-- Why can't you come in?
--We're just not allowed in.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.000
They're not allowed to let us
near you. -- What do you mean?

32:33.040 --> 32:35.840
-- It's not allowed. -- In case we catch
this silly Covid thing.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.320
-- Let's open the window, yeah?
--No, no, we can't...

32:39.360 --> 32:41.640
We can't open the window.
--Why can't we?

-- THEY LAUGH

He was fine.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.480
He just needed calming.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.160
-- Good news and bad news.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.720
The good news is, my mate Rob the

34:23.760 --> 34:25.080
-- Bad news?

34:25.120 --> 34:28.360
-- Gloria's got a cough
and a temperature.

Tim is with her in her room.
--Is she OK?

34:32.040 --> 34:33.320

available to send out right now.

have been sent to local hospitals

I always made sure I was the one
who cleaned her up,

you know, gave her her dignity
with the other members of staff,

35:35.040 --> 35:37.880
cos they were her employees
and they shouldn't be the ones

35:37.920 --> 35:39.720
to have to wash her bottom.

a know-it-all, you know?

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:39.360
Oi, you.

1:23:39.400 --> 1:23:40.400
Hey.

1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:43.920
Oi! -- I've got to get back to me ma.

1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:49.840
-- But, Tony, it's me. -- No, it's me ma.
Look, she needs me.

1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:52.880
She worries about me
when I'm not there.

1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:54.000
-- Well, she's this way.

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:59.080
Hey, you're a little bit lost.
Come on now. She's this way.

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:12.880
-- Hey.

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:15.840
You'll make the colour run
on me top like that.

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:21.680

elephant. Quiet your noise.

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:39.680
RADIO: -- Good afternoon and welcome
to Downing Street for the daily

1:24:39.720 --> 1:24:41.280
coronavirus briefing.

1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:43.680
I want to tell you what we've
been doing to protect

1:24:43.720 --> 1:24:46.360
people in care homes throughout
the crisis.

1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:49.960
Right from the start it's been clear
that this horrible virus

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:54.280
affects older people most. So, right
from the start we've tried to

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:57.440
throw a protective ring around
our care homes.

1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:01.160
We set out our first
advice in February

1:25:01.200 --> 1:25:04.880
and as the virus grew,
we strengthened it throughout.

1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:07.280
We made sure that care homes
have the resources

1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:10.000
they need to control the spread
of infection.

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.040
Social care is a devolved matter...

1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:27.560
-- It's lovely, that.

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:31.440
I've always said you can't beat
bread and butter.

1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:36.320
-- Yeah.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.400
Dad, you can get out of here.

1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.000
-- Now, don't get dramatic. -- Nah, I mean
it. I mean it, Dad, just go.

1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:57.160
-- You're quite the cover girl, do you
know that? -- What?

1:25:57.200 --> 1:25:59.720
-- Well, front page of the Echo you
were last week. "Covid on the run."

1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:01.840
-- You think you're the one who's going
to fuck it up for me?

1:26:01.880 --> 1:26:04.240
-- I remembered Nana took you
caravanning round here once.

1:26:04.280 --> 1:26:08.280
What did you...? Did you break into
the vans? -- Please. Please go away.

1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:10.120
-- Always with the fucking drama!

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:14.280
These are people's holidays,
people's dreams.

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:17.160
Where is he?

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:23.160
-- We've done ten days.

1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:28.040
We only need to do four more. -- What?

1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:31.800
-- We just need to get to 14 days
and then I'll make them put him

1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:32.960
somewhere different.

1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:35.200
-- This is quarantine?

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.520
-- Well, for 14 days, that's all that
matters, isn't it?

1:26:39.560 --> 1:26:41.280
That's what they say.

1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:44.000
You know, they'll know he doesn't
have it, then, and I think...

1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:48.360
I'm sure he will be allowed to go...

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:50.320
He'll be allowed to go
somewhere different.

1:26:57.800 --> 1:26:58.800
-- You're a mad cow.

1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:02.440
-- You always say that.
--Because you fucking are!

1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:09.520
-- We had 20 residents when
this started.

1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:12.720
Got given eight more.

1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:15.120
We lost nine.

1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:18.360
12 more had the bug.

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:23.360
They've been dying off,
one by one, Dad.

1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:26.160
No.

1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.760
The thought of leaving him
like that...

1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:38.600
-- What do you need?

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:43.920
-- Money.

1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.560
No... Uh, food. Just normal food.

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:50.840
-- Fucking hell.

1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.040
-- Steady, all right?

1:28:01.640 --> 1:28:05.040
-- What's going on? -- Right foot. Ooh!
There you go.

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:08.560
Left foot down. Next step. Perfect.

1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:12.040
Don't get your hopes up, all right?

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.240
But it's something, do you know
what I mean?

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:20.720
-- Where are you taking me? To
the firing squad or something?

1:28:20.760 --> 1:28:21.920
-- Sit down.

1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:27.560
-- What's going on?
--Just wait, will you?

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:40.000
Woohoo-hoo!

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:41.440
Ta-da!

1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:49.080
-- What is it you did?

1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:53.680
-- The cards.

1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:55.840
That'll be telling.

1:28:57.440 --> 1:28:58.440
Now...

1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:01.640
Do you know how to play shitter?

1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:03.160
-- HE CHUCKLES

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:05.800
Is this me surprise?

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:09.800
-- Yeah. Do you like it? -- Yeah.

1:29:13.240 --> 1:29:16.240
-- Do you know? I've never done much of
this before.

1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.920
To think the world we know
and it's all over. Walking.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:25.200
Seeing. Shift-free for one thing.

1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:30.640
-- We went on holiday when I was a kid.
--Oh. Where did you go?

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:39.520
-- Donegal.

1:29:39.560 --> 1:29:43.440
-- Oh, Donegal. -- Donegal. Yeah.
Yeah, me ma had a cousin.

1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:45.600
Left us some money when she died
and she just went, "Fuck it.

1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:47.520
"We're going to Donegal." To this
day, I don't know

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:49.400
why it was Donegal.

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:51.640
-- Were you there with Trish? -- Yeah.

1:29:55.400 --> 1:29:57.560
You look like her a little
bit, actually.

1:29:58.920 --> 1:29:59.920
Softness.

1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:04.920
Can always tell when someone's
a bit soft.

1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:07.360
-- I'm not soft. I'm not soft!

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:11.920
-- I'm saying you are, Sarah.
You're soft. -- Oh, right.

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.200
Hang on a minute.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.680
-- MUSIC: The Fields of Athenry

1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:41.080
I like this one. -- Me, too.

1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:48.280
-- This is Sarah's song.
--Yeah, I know. -- Yeah.

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:49.960
Yeah, you're a blue, though.

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:54.800
You're Everton. You're Everton.
--Nah! -- Yes, blue nose. "Meh!"

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:56.640
You're a blue nose.

1:30:56.680 --> 1:30:59.400
You are a blue nose.
--Yeah, I am. -- Yeah.

1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:02.160
-- And what? How did you know that?

1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:04.280
How did you know that?
--Because I can smell it.

1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:10.200
-- I thought I had you. -- No, you didn't.

1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:13.200
Hasn't put me off you, though.

1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:18.200
I love you, actually.

1:31:25.640 --> 1:31:26.800
-- I love you, too.

1:31:29.760 --> 1:31:33.880
-- # Our love was on the wing

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:38.080
# We had dreams and songs to sing

1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:44.320
# It's so lonely round the fields
of Athenry

1:31:46.640 --> 1:31:50.880
# By a lonely prison wall

1:31:50.920 --> 1:31:56.200
# I heard a young man calling... #

1:31:56.240 --> 1:31:58.920
-- Shit. Tony, go inside.

1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:00.920
-- Why? -- Go inside.

1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:03.800
Look, can you just...?
Just wait for one minute.

1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.760
-- Come on now, love. Come here. -- No!
No! No, you don't. No, you don't.

1:32:09.800 --> 1:32:12.200
-- Where are you taking her? -- You're
going to come with me for a minute.

1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:14.160
-- I don't want to go with you.
I want to go with Sarah.

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:16.880
-- You do not have to say anything.
--Tony! -- Sarah!

1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:21.800
-- Tony!

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.680
-- Harm your defence if you do not
mention when questioned something

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:30.680
you later rely on in court. Anything
you do say may be given in evidence.

1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:32.760
Do you understand me? -- Please don't
take him back there.

1:32:32.800 --> 1:32:36.640
You don't understand. -- Sarah, you're
in enough trouble as it is,
love. -- Please.

1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.120
Tony!

1:32:38.160 --> 1:32:40.200
Tony, are you OK?

1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:42.200
Come here, mate!

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:45.040
-- Calm down, love. -- Calm down.
--Come on, Sarah.

1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:48.120
-- Calm down! Leave him alone.

1:32:57.280 --> 1:32:59.400
-- MUFFLED: Sarah. No, I'm going
with Sarah.

1:33:57.360 --> 1:33:59.160
SHE SNIFFS

1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:01.400
-- Was it me dad who told you?

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:04.840
-- No, some walkers saw you.
Do-gooders, you know.

1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:09.440
-- Do-gooders. -- Well, they did good.
Caught you.

1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:19.760
-- I need your help. Listen to me. He's
done 12 days. He's nearly safe. -- No.

1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:24.040
-- No, I quarantined him, I did. -- No.

1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:27.520
-- Just radio in and tell them not
to take him back there.

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:29.160
Take him somewhere else, please.

1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:32.480
Please! -- Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.200
-- Please. -- It's not my
department, love.

1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:43.480
-- No. No. No, it never is, is it? Eh?

1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:49.080
No, never... Never is. Never is.
It's always someone else.

1:34:51.880 --> 1:34:53.680
It's the way this country works now.

1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:57.840
You know, keep our eyes
down to the rest of it.

1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:03.760
You know, cos if we see people
queueing up for food banks

1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:06.920
and if we see people lying...
Lying on the streets,

1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:11.320
if we see disabled people being left
to die, we'll feel sorry.

1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:17.200
We can't cope. We can't cope with
Tory. Not us.

1:35:18.680 --> 1:35:23.560
Not any more. Underlying health
conditions. What's in them?

1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:28.880
When did our lives stop being
worth the same, eh?

1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:30.280
Eh?!

1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:35.760
-- Come on, Tony.

1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:41.840
-- Come on, mate.

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:47.120
Welcome home.

1:35:47.160 --> 1:35:48.960
-- Where's Sarah?

1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.800
-- You don't need to worry about
her right now.

1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:57.600
Come on. Let's just get you in.
Have a nice cup of tea.
