11:49.835 --> 11:52.713
for this feeling of relief was...

11:53.630 --> 11:57.259
destroying you, then... then why not?

11:58.802 --> 12:00.846
People died, Ivy.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.433
Because of you.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.559
I know.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.394
I know. I know. (SOBS)

12:10.480 --> 12:12.191
Oh, God. I don't know

12:12.274 --> 12:15.068
how I could have been so stupid
and so weak.

12:15.152 --> 12:20.073
I don't know. I'm so sorry, Ally.
And now I see him for what he is.

12:20.157 --> 12:23.160
He's a demagogue and a manipulator and...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.996
everything he touches dies.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.582
But I was leaving. I was done.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.376
I was on my way out.
So you have to explain to me,

12:31.460 --> 12:33.587
why did you become a part
of this insanity?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.714
What choice did you give me?

12:37.007 --> 12:39.426
You wouldn't talk to me.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.472
You wouldn't let me see our son.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.519
I knew you would never leave
unless I got you out.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.396
You came back for me?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.190
I came back for Oz.

12:54.316 --> 12:57.236
And for our family.

12:57.319 --> 13:00.239
I'm not saying if we get out of this
that we're gonna be together.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.616
But if we can escape,

13:02.699 --> 13:05.536
I am not leaving Oz's mother behind.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.847
Hey, Ozymandius.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.767
Can you give your mama a hug?

13:43.532 --> 13:45.701
I'm sure you're feeling confused.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.707
You've probably heard some strange things
about me from your mom,

13:51.790 --> 13:54.042
and... maybe others.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.880
But I am never going to leave
you ever again.

13:57.963 --> 14:03.135
And it's going to take some time,
but I promise it will feel easy and normal

14:03.218 --> 14:06.597
before you know it. Okay?

14:06.680 --> 14:07.848
Okay.

14:11.435 --> 14:15.439
Would you just go upstairs for a minute
so the grownups can talk?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.857
And, um...

14:17.649 --> 14:19.151
I got you something.

I was an idiot.

We all were.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.745
The election made me lose my mind.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.834
I didn't believe in anything anymore,
except that my brother loved me

15:16.917 --> 15:18.961
and would take care of me no matter what.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.463
The world decided
to take a huge shit on my head,

15:21.547 --> 15:22.923
so I said fuck the world.

but he was one of us.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.645
He doesn't care about anyone.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.230
We have to run away.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.439

They lay out 14 steps, it's all in there.

We have to pack lightly
and get out as quickly as we can.

-And go where?
-WINTER: Anywhere.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.045
We just have to go now.

If Kai finds out we're even
thinking about this,

16:04.298 --> 16:06.300
we'll be killed
or put in the hole like Beverly.

We're gonna have so much fun.

29:54.920 --> 29:58.173
(WHISPERS) Ivy. Hey. What did we just do?

29:58.257 --> 29:59.466
We saved our son's life.

29:59.550 --> 30:01.635
By leaving him in there with that psycho?

30:01.718 --> 30:02.928
What choice did we have?

30:03.011 --> 30:05.722
If we had pushed just a little bit more,
he would have killed all of us,

30:05.806 --> 30:06.807
and you know it.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.559
Maybe now we have a chance.

30:20.821 --> 30:23.949
I found that paperwork in the attic.
It doesn't have a picture,

30:24.032 --> 30:26.201
but it has
all the sperm donor's attributes.

30:26.285 --> 30:28.912
I mean, look at this. It's got race, age,

30:28.996 --> 30:34.126
hair color, uh, weight, height,
IQ, m-medical history...

30:34.209 --> 30:38.005
The only it doesn't show
is the propensity to be a psychopath.

30:38.547 --> 30:40.674
All of this
could easily match up with Kai.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.384
And a million other white males.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.470
We have to go to the clinic.
I know they have pictures in their files.

30:45.554 --> 30:49.224
No, Ivy, the important thing
is Kai thinks Oz is his son.

30:49.308 --> 30:52.186
And as long as he believes that,
he's not gonna hurt him.

30:53.228 --> 30:54.855
He's safe now.

30:56.190 --> 30:59.943
What happened to you?
Th... that wasn't enough before.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.028
I know that.

31:01.111 --> 31:02.946
But I've had a chance to think,

31:03.030 --> 31:05.365
and you were absolutely right.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.538
We didn't have a choice.

31:11.622 --> 31:13.999
There is a way to get him back.

31:17.628 --> 31:20.297
The only answer is murder.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.341
That's exactly what I've been thinking.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.676
How would we do it? He has an army.

31:24.760 --> 31:27.721
It's gonna be dangerous,
and we... we can't put Oz at risk.

31:27.804 --> 31:29.681
Ivy, you need to calm down.

31:30.933 --> 31:33.769
It's not good for your health.
Come on. Sit down.

31:34.978 --> 31:38.315
Eat some food. Drink some wine.

31:40.359 --> 31:42.027

but it is your sauce.

31:58.502 --> 32:01.588
I did... pick the wine.

32:04.383 --> 32:07.052
That's what we had on our honeymoon.

32:07.135 --> 32:10.180
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

32:15.727 --> 32:16.728
Tonight?

32:24.194 --> 32:26.697
Tonight we start over.

32:56.894 --> 32:58.020

33:03.066 --> 33:04.484

33:15.120 --> 33:17.456
When I was put in the psych ward...

33:20.459 --> 33:23.545
that, uh, very first week inside...

33:24.713 --> 33:28.050
I had thoughts of suicide.

33:29.051 --> 33:33.138
I wanted to end it... so badly. I...

33:34.389 --> 33:36.808
was in so much pain.

33:38.310 --> 33:42.064
I felt completely alone in the world,

33:42.147 --> 33:44.149
and I almost did it.

33:45.150 --> 33:47.903
And then I thought about you...

33:52.950 --> 33:56.662
and how you left me alone in there

33:56.745 --> 33:58.288
without a word.

33:58.372 --> 33:59.665
No visits.

34:00.832 --> 34:03.377
Not even a glimpse of Oz

34:03.460 --> 34:05.170
in all that time.

34:05.963 --> 34:09.216
They told me you were insane.
I was trying to protect our son.

34:09.299 --> 34:12.761
You were trying to take him away from me.

34:12.845 --> 34:14.263
Admit it.

34:18.809 --> 34:20.769
So, in that second week,

34:20.853 --> 34:23.856
I pulled myself together,

34:23.939 --> 34:26.692
pushed those
self-destructive thoughts away

34:26.775 --> 34:28.151
and turned my energy

34:28.235 --> 34:32.739
towards freeing myself
from the fears that paralyzed me.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.826
And it was...

34:35.909 --> 34:37.995
desperately hard.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.997
But then I realized...

34:40.998 --> 34:44.710
that those fears were filling a hole
I had inside me,

34:44.793 --> 34:46.753
and you can't take those fears away

34:46.837 --> 34:49.298
without filling that hole
with something else.

34:50.507 --> 34:53.010
So I chose revenge.

34:55.846 --> 34:56.972
On you.

34:58.432 --> 34:59.433
Ally...

34:59.516 --> 35:02.477
You tried to make me go crazy.

35:02.561 --> 35:05.355
You tried to take my son away.

35:06.732 --> 35:10.235
You let yourself be seduced
by the babysitter.

35:10.319 --> 35:13.906
And worst of all,
you let Kai into our lives.

35:15.991 --> 35:19.119
And I couldn't forgive you for any of it.

35:22.164 --> 35:25.918
But then the thought of revenge...

35:26.001 --> 35:28.837
mmm, mmm, mmm...

35:28.921 --> 35:30.380
that cured me.

35:37.221 --> 35:38.764

Hell, this is the woman
I've always wanted...

35:53.195 --> 35:55.614
strong and assertive,
someone who doesn't cower

35:55.697 --> 36:00.118
at the sight of clowns,
or holes, or blood, or whatever else.

36:02.663 --> 36:06.667
But it's a passing phase, Ally.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.420
You're all bluster and no follow-through.

36:10.504 --> 36:12.923
You'll revert back to what you really are:

36:13.006 --> 36:15.217
a coward.

36:15.300 --> 36:19.054
So... you can dream of revenge,

36:20.389 --> 36:22.349
but I'm not afraid of you.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.408
Aah!

41:32.993 --> 41:33.994
(OZ SCREAMING)

41:44.713 --> 41:47.758
-Divine Ruler is not available.
-Yeah, I'm here to pick up my son.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.968
-That's not possible right now.
-Not possible?

41:50.052 --> 41:53.305
What the hell are you talking about?
Where is Oz?

41:55.933 --> 41:57.893
Please, Speed Wagon.

41:57.976 --> 41:59.603
I need to see my son.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.730
Look, I don't know where your kid is.

42:01.813 --> 42:03.732
Divine Ruler must have left
with him early this morning.

42:03.815 --> 42:06.652
-Left with him?
-I'm sure he's fine.

42:06.735 --> 42:07.736
Hey!

42:09.279 --> 42:11.323
You tell Kai, dinner at my house tonight.

42:12.491 --> 42:13.659
I'm making Manwiches.

42:18.830 --> 42:20.040
All I'm asking you to do

42:20.123 --> 42:22.584
is show me a photograph
of my son's biological father.

42:22.668 --> 42:24.169
That's it. That's all I need.

42:24.253 --> 42:27.881
Like I said, we never release
identifying information of our donors.

42:27.965 --> 42:29.842
There is nothing that I can do.

42:29.925 --> 42:30.926
Okay.

42:37.933 --> 42:40.602
My son's life depends on this.

42:42.688 --> 42:44.439
Woman to woman,

42:44.523 --> 42:46.942
I am begging you.

42:47.025 --> 42:49.611
Please. Please, help me.

43:02.708 --> 43:07.171
Thank you, um, it is, uh,
patient number X93994.

43:30.527 --> 43:33.155
Now there's something else
you're going to do for me.

43:48.086 --> 43:49.171
Mmm.

43:51.215 --> 43:53.717
I've been dreaming
of your cooking all week.

43:55.928 --> 43:57.846
Will you open the wine, please?

43:59.515 --> 44:00.974
Only for you.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.315
How's my son?

44:09.816 --> 44:11.527
Has he been behaving himself?

44:11.610 --> 44:12.611
Oh, yeah.

44:16.740 --> 44:17.783
He's cute.

44:18.700 --> 44:19.743
Talks a lot.

44:20.911 --> 44:22.079
No filter.

44:23.413 --> 44:24.498
Yeah.

44:25.499 --> 44:28.293
He can be a precocious little fucker.

44:28.377 --> 44:30.546
Well, with a name like Ozymandius,

44:30.629 --> 44:33.382
kid's just begging to get
the shit kicked out of him.

44:35.259 --> 44:36.385
Who came up with that?

44:37.636 --> 44:38.637
I did.

44:39.638 --> 44:41.974
King of kings.

44:43.851 --> 44:44.893
Oh.

44:45.561 --> 44:48.105
The boy is crying out
for order in his life.

44:49.606 --> 44:50.732
Discipline.

44:54.361 --> 44:56.488
That's why he's lucky to have you

44:56.572 --> 44:57.781
as a role model.

44:57.865 --> 44:59.408
Bon appétit.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.221
Yum!

45:22.890 --> 45:24.266
Manwich!

45:28.979 --> 45:29.980
Where's your wife?

45:30.063 --> 45:31.190
She's in the trunk.

45:32.316 --> 45:33.358
I killed her.

45:33.442 --> 45:34.526
(LAUGHS)

45:36.153 --> 45:37.529
Holy shit. Are you serious?

45:37.988 --> 45:38.989
Yeah.

45:39.072 --> 45:40.157
(LAUGHS)

45:41.408 --> 45:42.409
Wow.

45:42.492 --> 45:44.369
I had you all wrong, didn't I?

45:45.078 --> 45:46.121
How'd you do it?

45:46.205 --> 45:47.664
I poisoned her.

45:57.466 --> 46:00.469
How did it feel to watch her die?

46:00.552 --> 46:02.763
Oh, it felt fucking fantastic.

46:04.056 --> 46:05.724
She wanted us to kill you.

46:06.308 --> 46:07.601
Why am I still alive?

46:07.684 --> 46:09.478
A son needs his father.

46:09.561 --> 46:12.523
-So, you finally believe me.
-ALLY: I didn't...

46:13.815 --> 46:15.943
until I got the evidence.

46:18.612 --> 46:19.863
There it is,

46:19.947 --> 46:21.114
in black and white.

46:31.124 --> 46:33.627
You were an easy person to choose.

46:35.712 --> 46:36.964
Athletic...

46:38.215 --> 46:39.550
no diseases...

46:40.509 --> 46:42.886
IQ through the roof.

46:47.391 --> 46:49.935
It's like hitting the genetic jackpot.

46:50.727 --> 46:53.438
Somehow, all those years ago,

46:54.022 --> 46:55.983
I knew you were extraordinary...

46:57.401 --> 46:59.903
without ever meeting you
or even knowing your name.

46:59.987 --> 47:03.574
You were just donor number X93994.

47:03.657 --> 47:06.869
Something about you spoke to me.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.955
-Because this is cosmic,
-(EXHALES)

47:10.038 --> 47:13.250
written in the stars, divine intervention

47:13.333 --> 47:15.335
bringing us together.

47:15.419 --> 47:16.920
Holy shitballs.

47:17.004 --> 47:18.839
I'm fucking awesome.

47:18.922 --> 47:22.092
I literally spoke this into existence.

47:24.094 --> 47:25.220
I'm a daddy.

47:25.304 --> 47:27.222
I'm Oz's real daddy.

47:27.973 --> 47:30.058
We made...

47:30.142 --> 47:31.852
a messiah baby.

47:31.935 --> 47:32.978
This child

47:33.645 --> 47:36.481
is destined for greatness,

47:36.565 --> 47:37.941
like his father.

47:39.735 --> 47:41.111
My son.

47:45.532 --> 47:47.075
Our son.

47:53.123 --> 47:55.334
(ALLY COUGHING)

48:02.341 --> 48:03.842
The bed's for family.

48:11.099 --> 48:12.267
(COUGHING)

48:30.702 --> 48:31.703
(PANTING)

48:43.382 --> 48:44.675
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

49:14.913 --> 49:16.915
Now we can be a real family.
