Raven: Raven's Home
<i>was filmed in front</i>
<i>a live studio audience.</i>

00:03.629 --> 00:08.759
(knocking)

00:17.643 --> 00:20.062
(clattering)

00:20.062 --> 00:22.147
Oh, Rae, did you need help?

00:22.773 --> 00:25.359
No, Chels, I was practicing
my juggling.

00:26.610 --> 00:29.863
Aw, well good for you, Raven.
Keep at it, huh?

00:30.864 --> 00:33.116
Why do you have
all that stuff, though?

00:33.116 --> 00:36.119
Little Z hired me to make
jean jackets for his dancers

00:36.119 --> 00:37.579
for his new music video.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.331
Did you hear that?
I'm gettin' the check.

00:39.331 --> 00:43.126
‐(both laughing)
‐Signed by a 13‐year‐old,
but it's still a check.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.586
‐Yeah.
‐(laughs)

00:44.586 --> 00:47.089
Listen, you're not
gonna turn your
sewing machine on now,

00:47.089 --> 00:49.466
because I'm about to
video chat with a client.

00:50.676 --> 00:54.554
But the acoustics are
much better in the kitchen.
(chuckles)

00:56.139 --> 00:58.058
Hey, Mom, can you sign
my permission slip?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.061
Oh, yeah. Sure.
What, uh‐‐
What am I permissing?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.188
Oh. Our class is taking
a field trip.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.940
We're going to volunteer
at the recycling center.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.984
Oh! Booker, where's
your permission slip?

01:06.984 --> 01:09.736
Oh, oh, no.
I‐I volunteered not to go.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.911
Tess, we‐‐
we talked about
the knocking.

01:17.911 --> 01:21.456
‐Oh! Yeah, you're right.
‐(knocking)

01:23.250 --> 01:25.127
‐Guess what, guys?
‐What?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.587
We made it
to the next round

01:26.587 --> 01:28.463
in the Radio Eclipse Live
competition!

01:28.463 --> 01:30.048
‐Oh!
‐I‐I can't believe it!

01:30.048 --> 01:31.258
I mean,
I should believe it,

01:31.258 --> 01:32.843
but we actually did it.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.136
Well, okay,
so what do we do next?

01:34.136 --> 01:37.139
Well, we have to come up
with a theme for the next
music video.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.141
That means a new song,
costumes...

01:39.141 --> 01:41.852
I get it, Tess.
You don't have to be coy.

01:41.852 --> 01:44.938
Yes. I'll direct the video.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.150
Says who?
The Chi‐Lective's hot.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.319
All the greats are gonna
want to work with us.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.528
You gotta get in line.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.324
I'm just playing, travel size.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.369
All right, guys,
we got a lot to do,
so who has ideas?

01:59.369 --> 02:02.539
(all chattering)

02:02.539 --> 02:05.625
Hey, you guys!
Hey, you guys!
I got a good idea.

Except for the one where
I show up to school
with no pants on.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.481
Whew!

03:10.023 --> 03:11.983
Guys, if we want to win
that contest,

03:11.983 --> 03:14.486
we need to focus
on coming up a with
a theme for the video.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.239
‐(bell rings)
‐We'll talk about it later.
Bye.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.117
Hey, Booker,

03:20.117 --> 03:22.994
I thought you'd be
a lot happier about this.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.579
Come on.

03:25.831 --> 03:26.998
Yeah, I would be.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.459
If I didn't have
to deal with this.

03:30.168 --> 03:35.048
Ooh. Uh, any chance that "D"
stands for "darn good grade"?

03:35.048 --> 03:38.176
And the worst part is,
my mom has to sign this.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.303
Otherwise, I can't take
the make‐up test.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.602
No more Chi‐Lective.
You're finished.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.354
(echoing):
<i>Finished, finished...</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:54.234
Okay, new plan.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.069
My mom can't sign this.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.697
I just had a vision.
If my mom sees this,

03:58.697 --> 04:00.782
she's not gonna let me
be in the group anymore.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.784
I have to keep her
from finding out.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.954
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Your mom knows everything.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.415
She probably already knows
about this conversation.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.794
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:16.840 --> 04:18.425
Booker, you better
not be putting

04:18.425 --> 04:20.635
your sweaty gym clothes
in my locker again.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.929
It took a week to get the smell
of stale potatoes out.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.765
Okay, for the record,

04:24.765 --> 04:28.351
that was only because
it was French fry Friday,
you tater‐hater.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.314
‐Anyway, Nia, I need a favor.
‐What's up?

04:32.314 --> 04:36.651
I need you
to sign Mom's name
on my test paper.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.362
(laughs)
Raven Baxter.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.824
As in Raven
"You Gon' Get It"
Baxter.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.787
(laughs) Booker,
what makes you think
I can sign her name?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.580
'Cause you both
do the B's with, like,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.999
the small stem
and the little loop‐de‐loop.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.959
And it took me years
to master them.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.628
You think I'm gonna
use it for evil?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.214
So, you're on the fence
about it.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.633
Booker, I'm on the "no"
side of the fence.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.092
I'm not forging
Mom's signature.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.220
Please, Nia.
You're my sister.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.096
‐Help me out.
‐Nope.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.015
Uh‐uh, no.
You were supposed
to study for the test,

05:07.015 --> 05:08.391
but you didn't.
Why?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.895
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just bad
at taking tests.

05:11.895 --> 05:15.106
I‐I studied a little,
but it's a lot to remember.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.776
Please just sign the test.
It's not a big deal.

05:17.776 --> 05:21.029
It's a very big deal.
Forgery is a crime.

05:21.029 --> 05:24.074
What are you talking about?
You do it all the time, Tess!

05:24.074 --> 05:26.910
Hey. Hey, hey.
This isn't about me
right now.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.037
Besides, my mom taught me
how to sign her name

05:29.037 --> 05:30.497
so that
I'd stop bothering her

05:30.497 --> 05:32.999
while she's watching one of
those lonely housewife shows.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.418
I'm not doing it, Booker.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.003
Then I'm gonna get
kicked out of the group.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.172
We're not gonna kick you
out of The Chi‐Lective.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.091
Oh, you won't have to.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.968
According to my vision,
Mom's gonna do it.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.887
That's why I need you
to sign this test.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.139
Look, show Mom that test,

05:48.139 --> 05:49.724
and I'll help you study
for the make‐up,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.685
but I'm no signing it for her.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.690
Bedding. Clothing.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.361
Delicates.
(purring)

06:03.029 --> 06:05.365
Dang it.
Cat Man Clark.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.621
Hey, Mr.‐‐ No, Mr. Clark,
hey, you can't use
all three machines.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.458
‐It's one per tenant.
‐I am not aware of that rule.
(chuckles)

06:15.458 --> 06:17.460
I'm just saying.
It's common courtesy.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.005
Oh. well, I was here first.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.966
And my 12 cats need
their pajamas cleaned.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.968
Who puts their cats in pajamas?

06:24.968 --> 06:28.638
Oh, like I'm the person
who made up the phrase
"the cat's pajamas"?

06:28.638 --> 06:31.474
Could you just remember
to clean out your machines
when you're done?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.435
I don't want to put a label
on my clothes that says,

06:33.435 --> 06:35.020
"May contain hairballs."

06:35.020 --> 06:36.438
Meow!

06:38.148 --> 06:41.985
May I remind you of last month's
melted candy bar incident?

06:41.985 --> 06:45.113
That chocolate permanently
stained Whisker's lederhosen.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.032
Are you implying that
I'm not smart enough

06:47.032 --> 06:49.534
to take my delicious
chocolate bar out of my‐‐
I mean, what‐‐ wait‐‐

06:49.534 --> 06:51.286
Lederhosen?

06:51.286 --> 06:53.079
He's a German short hair.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.831
Good, 'cause it was
a German chocolate bar.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.666
‐(growls)
‐(hisses)

06:57.876 --> 07:01.671
You guys, so the host
of Radio Eclipse Live
just announced

07:01.671 --> 07:03.340
that the winner
of the competition

07:03.340 --> 07:05.550
will not only win 25K,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.969
but they will also
sign a record deal!

07:07.969 --> 07:11.139
‐A record deal? Are you serious?
‐That could change our lives.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.601
Can you imagine
the exposure I'll get
for directing the video?

07:14.976 --> 07:19.064
Wow, minnow.
A little less about you,
and more of us.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.483
We're the only ones
repping Chi‐Town.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.026
We have to bring this home.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.362
‐Whatever it takes.
‐Yeah.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.615
Yeah, Nia. Whatever it takes.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.118
I am not signing
that test for you.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.620
I think Nia's right.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.872
There's no real reason
for us to cheat like this.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.375
There's three reasons
for us to cheat like this.

07:38.375 --> 07:42.962
$25,000. A record deal.
A trip to Cali.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.799
Yeah, that's three reasons.
You know,

07:45.799 --> 07:49.594
just like the third amendment.
Which is...

07:49.594 --> 07:52.430
Mm. Uh...

07:53.264 --> 07:57.143
"Do what you need to do
to get what you want."

07:57.936 --> 08:01.648
Oh, come on, Nia.
He is more than
a week‐long project.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.277
So you guys want me
to go against everything
I believe in,

08:06.277 --> 08:07.529
and forge Mom's signature?

08:07.529 --> 08:09.197
Both:
Yes!

08:10.532 --> 08:13.702
Oh! So now you wanna
hear my ideas?

08:14.119 --> 08:16.746
Nia, come on.
We could all use this.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.332
Just think how much
we could do with that money.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.543
Please, Nia. Come on.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.253
It's just
one small signature.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.298
One small stem and two
little loop‐de‐loops.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.343
No, Booker. I can't.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.430
Come on, Nia.
I'll owe you forever.

08:33.430 --> 08:37.100
Look, we're twins.
We shared an umbilical cord.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.604
Maybe. I'm not‐‐
I'm not sure
how biology works.

Please.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.570

Fine.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.447
I'll do it.

You don't think I know

You don't think I know.

09:02.459 --> 09:06.212
Cat Man Clark wants to use
all the washing machines.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.339
But I got a surprise for him.

I'm about to wash everything

Oh.

Oh, well, I guess
I could make the call
from the laundry room

10:01.267 --> 10:02.936

on your make‐up test?

21:09.977 --> 21:12.104
A B‐plus. You passed!

21:12.104 --> 21:15.024
You know I like to call it
the Booker‐plus,
but I passed,

21:15.024 --> 21:17.735
‐I passed. I passed. I passed.
‐You passed. You passed.

21:17.735 --> 21:18.986
‐I passed. I passed.
‐He passed. He passed.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.989
Who at the door?
Who at the door?
Who at the door?

21:21.989 --> 21:23.449
Aah!

21:26.160 --> 21:28.496
(whispers):
It's‐‐ It's the cat man
from the second floor.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.708
Hey. Hey, Mr. Clark.
What happened?

21:32.708 --> 21:34.585
Uh, Whiskers escape again?

21:34.585 --> 21:38.798
For the last time,
he does not escape.
He power walks.

21:39.465 --> 21:43.052
Now, did you litter
the laundry room

21:43.052 --> 21:45.346
‐with these fake signs?
‐Mm‐mm.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.140
Wasn't me. Mm‐mm.
I don't know who
would do such a thing.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.520
Really. It sounds like someone

21:52.520 --> 21:55.147
is suffering from amnesia.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.150
I am so sorry.
Well, in that case,

21:58.150 --> 22:00.945
I'm not Raven Baxter.
She's down the hall.
Bye.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.530
No, no‐‐

22:03.197 --> 22:06.450
Now, before we go any further,
I would like you to know

22:06.450 --> 22:09.411
that they have cameras
in and outside of
the laundry room.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.499
Mm, what's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

22:13.499 --> 22:16.126
‐No.
‐(both growling)

22:16.126 --> 22:18.963
‐We're gonna talk about this
right now‐‐
‐(yelling)

22:18.963 --> 22:21.423
‐Now, please, help your momma.
Help your momma!
‐(meowing)

22:24.885 --> 22:27.638
‐Mr. Clark: We're gonna
talk about this later!
‐Mm, bye!

22:31.934 --> 22:34.103
You have anything
you want to tell us?

22:34.854 --> 22:37.940
I plead the fifth.
The right to remain silent.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.111
Aw. You learned something.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.821
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Write a song about it.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.991
You can go on your field trip,
only because it's for school.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.076
‐Thank you.
‐You're welcome.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.290
Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess!

22:54.290 --> 22:55.916
Tess.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.169
‐(knocking)
‐Tess.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.338
Guess what, guys?

23:01.338 --> 23:03.924
We got the results back
from Radio Eclipse Live.

23:03.924 --> 23:04.842
Okay.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.553
And the Chi‐Lective
made it to the finals.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.306
(all cheering)

23:10.306 --> 23:12.182
That's amazing.
They didn't even‐‐

23:12.182 --> 23:15.060
‐Hey, what's going on?
‐We are going to LA.
