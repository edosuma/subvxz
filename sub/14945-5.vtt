Previously on Continuum...

00:02.503 --> 00:05.666
Alec and I
are in the process of forging
a business alliance.

00:05.756 --> 00:07.587
You can't game
someone's life like this.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.332
Jason's a little skittish...

00:09.427 --> 00:10.416
MAN: IS that him?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.842
You are connected
to these terrorists.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.836
Until you get
truthful with me,

00:13.931 --> 00:15.717
we're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

00:16.142 --> 00:18.633
WOMAN: Carlos radioed in,
they were ambushed.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.514
How the hell did Liber8
get wind of this?

00:20.605 --> 00:22.891
Do you think we have
someone inside
feeding intel to Liber8?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.013
Well, lwouldn't
rule it out.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.275
(CHILDREN TALKING
INDISTINCTLY)

00:31.741 --> 00:33.231
Have you seen Sam?

00:48.507 --> 00:50.088
What're you doing
out here, Sam?

00:50.468 --> 00:51.833
Your birthday party
is inside.

00:53.638 --> 00:54.878
I wish he was here.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.130
I know you do,

00:57.850 --> 00:59.010
he wishes
he was here too.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.807
Sometimes Dad
just has to work late.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.187
ls Daddy mad at me?

01:05.608 --> 01:07.098
Oh, sweetheart, no.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.603
Why would he
be mad at you?

01:09.070 --> 01:10.480
He wanted to be here,

01:10.988 --> 01:12.649
he just couldn't
make it back
in time.

01:13.866 --> 01:15.606
The good news is

01:15.952 --> 01:17.283
you get to
see him tomorrow.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.406
We do this
all over again,

01:19.497 --> 01:22.159
and it'll be like
having two birthdays.

01:23.834 --> 01:24.960
(SIGHING)

01:25.836 --> 01:27.667
What about

01:28.798 --> 01:29.833
an early
birthday gift?

01:31.801 --> 01:33.166
This one's from Dad.

01:36.055 --> 01:37.420
It's wrapped so well.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.504
lfyou're not
gonna open it,

01:38.599 --> 01:39.679
you know,
I'm pretty curious...

01:39.767 --> 01:42.099
So, I might
have to just peek
in there myself.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.394
Wow, cool!

01:55.366 --> 01:56.697
Can I go play for a bit?

01:57.076 --> 01:58.532
I'll call you when
it's time for cake.

02:02.748 --> 02:03.954
Look at what I got!

02:04.041 --> 02:05.326
BOY: Oh, What is it?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.201
The Colonials
versus the Rebels.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.711
Battle of Georgia Strait!

02:11.215 --> 02:14.048
BOY: Oh, great,
that's awesome!

02:17.221 --> 02:18.882
Oh, look
what we have!

02:30.026 --> 02:31.015
KIERA: 2077.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.317
My time, my city, my family.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.687
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

02:35.781 --> 02:37.191
they were condemned to die.

02:37.283 --> 02:38.398
They had other plans.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.279
A time-travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.492

02:42.580 --> 02:45.822
but I can’t be sure
what / will return to
if history is changed.

02:45.958 --> 02:46.947
Their plan,

02:47.043 --> 02:50.126
to corrupt
and control the present
in order to win the future.

02:50.212 --> 02:52.043
What they didn’t plan on
was me.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.413
KIERA: Alec, I need
your help.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.533
I can't deal with this
primitive database.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.284
Did you find anything?

03:32.380 --> 03:33.460
SADLER: No Escher anywhere.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.173
/ looked into Piron,
privately held

03:35.424 --> 03:36.539
so there's no
annual reports

03:36.634 --> 03:38.340
and very little
promotional material.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.797
lf Escher is running it,
then he's like the Great Oz,

03:41.097 --> 03:42.633
hands on lever,
all curtain...

03:43.057 --> 03:46.549
In 2077,
Piron is one of the top
20 corporations.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.759
They have a seat
at the congress,

03:47.853 --> 03:49.309
and Escher
got them there.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.808
Well, in 2013
they might as well
be SadTech.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.138
Justanidea.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.937
Please keep working on this.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.654
Yeah, lwill.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.478
Is everything okay?

03:59.990 --> 04:01.196
You seem a little edgy.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.901
It's Sam's birthday today,

04:04.995 --> 04:05.984
I'm just not...

04:07.665 --> 04:08.745
l have to go.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.420
So what've you got?
A colossal headache.

04:16.632 --> 04:20.420
Travis and Garza allied,
Liber8 splintered,

04:20.511 --> 04:24.003
and, uh, both groups
appealing to completely
different constituencies.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.713
Mmm-hmm.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.173
Maybe we send
this guy in after them.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.808
Um, I know we could
get more on Travis

04:29.895 --> 04:32.557
if we were following
the gangs he's coerced
intojoining him.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.309
Is this your kid's?

04:35.067 --> 04:36.182
Yeah. Can we focus?

04:36.277 --> 04:38.268
Yeah, you want
surveillance on
the gang clubhouses,

04:38.362 --> 04:40.569
wire taps and satellite
GPS tracking.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.942
How often
do you get visitation?

04:50.082 --> 04:51.583
These gangsters
are sloppy.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.207
They lack discipline.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.003
Travis' new army
may end up

04:55.087 --> 04:56.418
doing our work for us.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.249
Yeah, agreed.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.211
But, they've been breeding
their own lawyers
for years now,

05:01.302 --> 05:04.214
we can't even get
near these guys
with a camera phone.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.470
Not at the clubhouses,
but they don't live there.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.800
Mmm-hmm.

05:07.892 --> 05:08.881
They live out
in the suburbs,

05:09.310 --> 05:11.301
most of them,
in big houses

05:11.395 --> 05:13.727
with pretty wives
and 15 kids.

05:14.732 --> 05:15.892
Maybe they're
the smart ones.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.232
Can I have that?
Yeah.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.191
Look, Kiera,

05:27.286 --> 05:29.322
I know this has been
a rough week for you
with your friend...

05:29.413 --> 05:31.153
I'm going to go see
what Section 6
can do for us.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.237
...dying.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.462
The man himself!
Yeah.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.212
Sorry I'm late.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.664
I'm just glad
you agreed to see me.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.340
Ah, anything to keep you
from playing this show up

05:43.427 --> 05:44.507
when you least
want it game.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.381

Pmamn

05:47.890 --> 05:49.630
We're going to have
to talk about
Director's insurance

05:49.725 --> 05:51.590
and fiduciary
responsibility, partner.

05:51.727 --> 05:52.716
What, this?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.139
Company car can
pick you up for work.
No way!

05:55.981 --> 05:57.357
I live like
five blocks from here.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.685
People wait
their whole lives

05:58.776 --> 06:00.937
to see evaluation
like this go public.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.611
All you need to do
is stay in one piece
until it does.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.609
No buts.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.612
I haven't even
agreed to do business
with you yet.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.110
Formality.
You seem pretty sure.

06:11.622 --> 06:14.989
It's because I know
what's on the other side
of this door.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.451
The question is,
do you?

06:29.515 --> 06:30.880
Get the lights here...

06:33.852 --> 06:34.932
Ta-da!

06:36.772 --> 06:37.887

06:40.693 --> 06:42.979
Still has that
new server smell.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.323
Well?

06:52.329 --> 06:53.364
Okay.

06:53.455 --> 06:54.831
I'll take you on
as a minority partner.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.993
You do realize
this minority is going
to be number one

06:57.084 --> 06:58.494
in a few short years,
white boy.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.371
You've got the capital,
but you can't remember

07:00.462 --> 07:02.669
the name
of every derby winner
for the next decade.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.499
What you want,
what you need, I got.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.970
It's 50/50.

07:09.054 --> 07:10.385
51/49.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.254
I'm the 51,
and we're pursuing projects

07:12.349 --> 07:13.384
I'm interested in.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.018
Well, I know
they're mutual.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.347
I'm also gonna need
a living space
for those all-nighters.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.769
I'll see to it.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.899
So how secure
is this place?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.147
Every entrance
is controlled
by biometrics

07:26.238 --> 07:28.524
and RFID encoded
access cards.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.612
I need us
to be really clear.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.445
l have final say
in all the science
we develop

07:36.540 --> 07:37.620
and how we use it.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.289
That's the beauty
of our little venture.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.287
No VC's making nice

07:41.378 --> 07:43.710
while they wait
to strip you
of your ideas.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.626
This is it.
You and me, partner.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.959
That wasn't an answer.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.345
You have final say.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.404
For tomorrow,
in case you need back-up.

a minute?
Not really.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.589
Can you get one?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.001
Uh, Travis Verta's escape.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.256
I've been looking
for whoever

08:33.347 --> 08:34.382
ratted out
our operation.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.429
I thought Dillon said
our department
had been cleared.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.848
Yeah, and he asked me
to keep looking.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.974
I found a CO of the person
who looks good,

08:40.187 --> 08:42.553
booze, bookies,
loan defaults,
all the usual markers...

08:42.773 --> 08:44.309
So, show Dillon.
Yeah, he's not buying it.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.023
He says it's not enough,
but he'll listen to you.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.898
Right, me, Section 6,
my magic contacts.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.603
No, no. I've already
made the case
with the suspect.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.235
He has motive
and opportunity.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.314
ljust think
the inspector

08:54.410 --> 08:55.866
isn't giving this
full consideration.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.284
Okay, put it on my desk

08:57.371 --> 08:58.827
and lwill have him
review it.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.620
(SOFTLY) Like it's gonna
make a difference.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.788
Thanks.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.617
Is she all right?

09:05.796 --> 09:07.081
That's a good question.

09:31.864 --> 09:33.354
What? Why?
What are you talking about?

09:33.699 --> 09:34.814

kidding me.

to be kidding me!
Damn it!

Thank you.

Sorry about that.

the best of us.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.074
Yeah, that was, uh...
Intense?

10:28.796 --> 10:29.785
Lousy day.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.336
You want to talk
about it?

just now.

I should be with today.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.095
Birthday.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.385
Tough missing those.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.099
Especially with
the little ones.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.935
Yeah.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.266
Maybe you'll get
the chance later.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.457
What is happening?

11:13.882 --> 11:15.258

myself with the active

while internal affairs
does their search.

but as soon
as we've contained
the situation,

12:06.560 --> 12:07.675
interviews immediately.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.687
Kiera Cameron
is your partner,

12:09.813 --> 12:11.314
for lack
of a better term?
Right again.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.470
I need to speak
with her.

12:12.691 --> 12:13.726
Where is she?

12:15.736 --> 12:17.021
Whatjust happened?

12:17.779 --> 12:18.985
I was ambushed.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.648
I needed to hang
this Travis cock-up
on someone,

12:23.285 --> 12:24.900
and Harris is here
to clean house.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.867
Trust me, she won't
hesitate to throw
anybody under the bus,

12:28.957 --> 12:29.992
so watch your back.

12:34.755 --> 12:35.915
What can I do
to help you?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.831
When I figure it out,
lllbeintouch.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.402
(CHUCKLES)

13:11.792 --> 13:12.872
(CHUCKLES)
Jason?

13:13.210 --> 13:14.199
Hi!

13:14.544 --> 13:15.533
Why are you following me?

13:16.004 --> 13:17.960
Uh...
'Cause I'm tracking you.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.335
Okay, yes, we all agree
that you're tracking
and following me.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.625
Yeah. I should
get a coffee.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.709
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll get you a coffee,

13:24.805 --> 13:25.840
just tell me
what you want.

13:25.931 --> 13:26.920
Uh, cappuccino?

13:27.015 --> 13:28.391
Uh... Why are you
tracking me?

13:29.059 --> 13:31.050
Oh, yeah, you know,
I have something for you.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.218
What is this?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.726
I have some
very good skills for a guy
in your line of work.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.941
If you're interested
in time travel, right?

13:40.570 --> 13:41.605
I know you are.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.906
Huh?
Uh, maybe we should
take this outside.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.409
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.033
We'll be back.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.875
The tight ass
in Dillon's office
is looking for you.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.542
Yeah, we're old friends.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.793
You're kidding.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.091
Forget it.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.594
Just keep it
together, all right?

14:07.764 --> 14:08.844
I'm fine.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.588
Listen.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.049
We are chasing
our own tail.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.593
Who stands to benefit
from sidelining us?

14:15.105 --> 14:16.094
Liber8.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.178
We've already canceled out
the chance

14:17.274 --> 14:18.263
of there being a mole
in this department.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.438
Maybe we missed it.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.771
There must be
somewhere else to look.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.272
Some other way to look.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.523
No, we have,
we've searched through...

14:24.614 --> 14:25.774
NORA:
Special Agent Cameron.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.320
Nice to see you again.
Join me?

14:29.661 --> 14:32.949
Kiera's not
with the police, officially.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.122
So officially,
she should have
nothing to worry about.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.032
Call it courtesy.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.742
She still has the right
to a department lawyer.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.243
Should we get you one?

14:41.214 --> 14:42.203
Should you?

14:42.299 --> 14:43.584
I'm sure
we'll be done quickly.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.629
That wasn't an answer.
Kiera...

14:49.556 --> 14:50.762
Alec.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.060
Oh, Alec, I really hope
you're listening right now.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.844
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

14:59.566 --> 15:02.399
NORA: Today's date
is March 15,2013.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.980
Present are,
VPD Inspector Nora Harris,

15:05.572 --> 15:06.857
Detective Ed Lam,

15:07.324 --> 15:09.030
and Special Agent
Kiera Cameron.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.820
The nano circuits
and the relays,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.787

efficiency under
normal conditions...

15:15.874 --> 15:16.989
Kiera?

15:17.084 --> 15:18.790
NORA:
Let the record show,
Special Agent Cameron

15:18.877 --> 15:20.583
has waived
her right to council.

15:20.962 --> 15:21.997
Her cell phone.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.495
I gotta go!

15:23.590 --> 15:24.955
Hey, is that Kiera?
Wait, wait!

15:25.801 --> 15:26.790
You wanna take it?

15:27.302 --> 15:28.587
We're investigating
a possible mole.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.169
We'll need your phone
until you've been cleared.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.301
Don't worry,
I can wipe it
from my end.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.180
What is he doing here?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.935
I've asked
Agent Gardiner to join us.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.108
A third party
ensures transparency
for all of us.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.231
Imagine.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.191
I'm here
to protect you.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.946
This is your witch hunt?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.149
NORA:
Let the record also show

15:52.244 --> 15:54.326
that Agent Gardiner
from CSIS hasjoined us.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.868
In case you
run out of questions?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.363
Just think of this
as a continuation

15:57.457 --> 15:58.913
from our
earlier meeting, Kiera.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.036
It can be that easy.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.376
Now.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.708
Your record
does intrigue me.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.548
Essentially, you're here
on your own recognizance,

16:08.802 --> 16:11.088
supported by some
electronic bread crumbs

16:11.179 --> 16:12.385
thataHlead
to one place.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.677
Section 6.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.347
NORA:
An organization apparently
backed by the US Government.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.601
Yet neither the FBI
nor the NSA have
ever heard of it.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.220
How does that work?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.563
That's need to know.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.811
Inspector Dillon accepted
your credentials because
you are effective.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.237
And I admire his zeal.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.902
But look where
it got him.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.532
And your effectiveness
is a matter of debate,
frankly.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.993
We'd like to know
what your case officer
has to say.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.870
You can call him. Or her.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.702
Now.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.085
Kiera, this is serious!
I need time to build you
a new cover.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.248
That won't work.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.425
I'm almost at the lab,
just hold them off
till I get there.

16:52.596 --> 16:53.927
Because you
have to invent him?

16:55.599 --> 16:57.430
Cameron. A name.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.928
I'm not going to tell you
anything about myself,

17:00.687 --> 17:03.019
my handlers,
or Section 6.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.522
If you're looking
for a mole,
search my computer.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.100
Go through my phone.

17:08.820 --> 17:09.900
We are.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.688
Just a second!

17:14.951 --> 17:16.236
Now this is interesting.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.451
There's nothing in here
about her family.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.199
But we talked about them
when we met.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.832
And yet,
they're completely
absent from your record.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.212
You misunderstood me.

17:26.296 --> 17:27.456
Someone you were
supposed to be with?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.542
A family member?
A son?

17:32.135 --> 17:33.545
And today is his birthday.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.800
All right, Kiera, be careful.
I'm building you
a new record.

17:37.891 --> 17:38.880
Just hold them off.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.804
NORA: Is your son
with your husband?

17:46.191 --> 17:48.523
I don't have a family.

17:51.947 --> 17:52.982
What's that?

17:55.825 --> 17:56.814
May I have that back?

17:56.952 --> 17:59.159
Is this another one
of your fantasies, Cameron?

18:00.622 --> 18:04.706
Fake government agents
that employ you,
family that loves you.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.158
Give it back.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.408
No birth certificate.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.835
How old is he?

18:08.964 --> 18:10.625
Seven? Eight?

18:11.174 --> 18:12.334
No marriage certificate.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.831
We Will find him.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.000
And then we'll find you.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.550
(STUTTERS) You can't do...

18:21.017 --> 18:22.302
(CHUCKLING)
Ithink he's gonna
miss this.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.429
He doesn't exist!

18:24.521 --> 18:25.681
|Wi|| kill you!

18:26.314 --> 18:27.349
Kiera, go easy!

18:32.279 --> 18:34.361
Kiera! Kiera!

18:35.198 --> 18:38.110
You know, I think
we might be on
to something here.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.492
NORA: Cameron?

18:43.540 --> 18:45.405
Who are you?
Who are you?

18:45.542 --> 18:46.657
I could write you up
for this!

18:47.043 --> 18:48.123
Officer Cameron,
you just threatened

18:48.211 --> 18:49.712
the life
of a fellow officer.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.045
I need to see
that you can regain
control of your emotions.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.459
What?
That's called assault.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.588
I'm Mr. Fairweather,
from CPS.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.377
I'm sorry, I...

18:59.472 --> 19:01.008
I'm here to do
your psych review.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.049
I need a minute.
No, No!

19:04.519 --> 19:05.599
You're not going
anywhere.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.435
I'm concerned
that you're a danger
to yourself

19:07.522 --> 19:08.887
and to others

19:08.982 --> 19:10.563
so I've taken you offline.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.574
Let's start
with your son. Sam.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.160
(EXHALING)
I'll be right back.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.913
Wait! We're not done!
Just, let her
sweat it out.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.419
Obviously, your relationship
with Sam is a stressor
of some kind.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.215
My relationship?

19:38.303 --> 19:41.010
Let's gain some clarity
so we can get you
back in the field.

19:42.766 --> 19:43.755
Alec?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.928
Uh, no. Sam.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.676
Kiera, I suggest that
you don't test me,

19:47.771 --> 19:49.056
we've only got
so much time.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.187
How much time?
I'm part of your
CMR coding,

19:51.274 --> 19:52.810
I'm familiar with your
personal history,

19:52.901 --> 19:54.311
and l have access
to all your files

19:54.402 --> 19:57.394
so I'm certain
we can get you
operational in no time.

19:57.489 --> 19:58.820
You're not answering
my question.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.813
I do provide
an authentic
therapy experience.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.319
How much time?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.484
You're feeling
enough pressure
for now.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.115
How much time for what?

20:08.291 --> 20:09.326
Nothing.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.583
How much time?

20:19.677 --> 20:21.884
I'd like to see you
operationally functional
in an hour.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.548
And if I'm not?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.307
If I find you at less than
80% efficiency,

20:28.603 --> 20:30.969
the memory that
is causing you
the most distress

20:32.190 --> 20:33.225
will be erased.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.979
I need my COM's back.
Certainly.
That's why I'm here.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.900
Butyour
recent outburst...

20:42.158 --> 20:44.069
That wasn't
an outburst!

20:44.202 --> 20:46.284
They are trying
to take me down!

20:50.834 --> 20:53.951
As I said,
your record is exemplary.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.915
But since
she's been assigned
to this department,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.788
you've been
involved in some
questionable calls.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.711
Ah, if that's your read.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.007
GARDINER:
No, read me this,
how is it

21:02.095 --> 21:03.835
that Cameron's always
one step ahead?

21:04.139 --> 21:05.675
There's no way
that Kiera is Liber8.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.589
Where does
she get her intel?
Section 6.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.932
GARDINER: It doesn't exist.
Yeah, so you
keep saying.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.056
Would you not be
ashamed to throw
away your career

21:12.147 --> 21:13.557
on a woman
that no one trusts?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.897
You don't work
alongside her
every single day, okay?

21:15.984 --> 21:17.474
She takes some risks.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.650
Some crazy risks
to bring down Liber8!

21:19.779 --> 21:20.939
I have a different
interpretation.

21:21.030 --> 21:23.487
I believe Section 6
is a legend that
she created.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.691
Travis Verta's escape
is still a mystery.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.194
As is her own
miraculous survival
during the shoot-out.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.660
Unless you realize
that Liber8 wouldn't
kill their own agent.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.408
Their mole.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.790
Are you sure that
there isn't some light

21:37.881 --> 21:39.587
that you can shed
on this, Carlos?

21:40.884 --> 21:42.545
Are you sure
you don't have some
questions of your own?

21:47.056 --> 21:48.637
Let me speak
with Alec.

21:48.725 --> 21:49.760
Alec.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.309
Can he help you
moderate your behavior?

21:53.730 --> 21:55.891
Well, he invented you,

21:56.107 --> 21:57.972
and you are attempting
to moderate my behavior,

21:58.067 --> 22:00.228
so I would say
a resounding "yes"!

22:01.070 --> 22:02.059
Yes.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.561
He invented?

22:04.491 --> 22:05.651
Alec Sadler.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.990
True. You're in contact?

22:14.792 --> 22:16.407
Ah, also true.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.001
So,canl?

22:21.633 --> 22:23.169
Please, Alec, be there.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.801
Suit signature
is nowhere,

22:27.931 --> 22:29.421
CMR is offline.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.552
(EXHALING) Come on.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.268
(VIBRATING)

22:46.741 --> 22:47.776
Hello?

22:48.826 --> 22:49.815
Who is this?

22:50.119 --> 22:51.108
Hello, Alec.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.249
Oh, crap!

22:55.917 --> 22:57.782
What did you mean
when you said
Sam didn't exist?

22:57.961 --> 22:59.952
Please, let me
speak with Alec,

23:01.005 --> 23:02.620
and I swear
we can talk
about Sam.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.344
Alec?

23:16.521 --> 23:17.510
Kiera! You're back!

23:18.314 --> 23:19.269
Only for a moment.

23:19.357 --> 23:21.222
What happened?
Your CMR totally shut down.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.277
Oh, cognitive
therapist, cool.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.647
My biometrics
triggered a psych eval.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.410
You have an
on board shrink?

23:31.661 --> 23:32.901
What did you do?
Nothing.

23:33.121 --> 23:34.361
Is that
what you think?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.664
I lost my temper.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.242
So Dr. Feelweird cut us off?
Unbelievable!

23:41.838 --> 23:42.918
Let me check the code.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.414
I'm locked out.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.124
No outside operator
has access

23:48.219 --> 23:50.050
until the results
of the review
are completed.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.965
Even Alec Sadler.

23:52.682 --> 23:53.717
I designed you!

23:53.850 --> 23:55.306
Will... Design you.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.887
What do you think
I should change
when it comes time

23:56.978 --> 23:57.967
for me to design it?

23:59.063 --> 24:01.770
Remove its ability
to erase my memories!

24:02.525 --> 24:04.140
Only those memories
causing the distress

24:04.235 --> 24:05.896
leading to the disruption
of functionality.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.695
Only my whole life, then.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.319
You won't know me.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.327
I won't know anybody.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.195
I'll figure
something out.

24:21.419 --> 24:22.454
Time is up.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.761
Okay, full psychological
health in an hour or less.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.051
Let's do it.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.887
You seem most upset
about your son, Sam.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.148
I miss him.
More than I can say.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.442
So you've repressed
the grief,

24:48.529 --> 24:49.518
turned it into anger.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.689
I worry that
I may never
get back to him.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.363
I don't see anything
in your file about
a separation or divorce.

24:56.788 --> 24:57.777
How come you
don't see him?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.453
Because he hasn't
been born yet.

24:59.916 --> 25:00.951
What makes you
think that?

25:03.169 --> 25:04.329
Because he hasn't.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.956
You don't know
what time this is.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.921
No record of psychosis
in the family...

25:12.095 --> 25:13.835
This is the year 2013.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.545
lam in the year 2013,

25:15.640 --> 25:16.880
it is my son's birthday

25:16.974 --> 25:18.680
and he hasn't
been born yet.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.093
Hmm. Extreme
psychological break.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.729
No. Do you know
where you are?
I mean, when?

25:25.650 --> 25:28.016
Look around you!
This is the year
2013, this is it!

25:28.277 --> 25:30.859
And they use these
to dry their hands.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.031
Hey, you alone?
Yeah.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.033
Okay.
We've got a problem.

25:38.121 --> 25:39.281
Yeah, no kidding.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.705
I kept files on you.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.198
For Dillon.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.420
It was before
we were sure
ofyouragenda.

25:46.504 --> 25:47.493
He had me track you.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.916
How thoroughly?

25:50.007 --> 25:52.043
Well, if Nora
or Gardiner sees them,

25:52.135 --> 25:53.375
those files might
cause you problems.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.505
Might?
There are cell traces

25:55.596 --> 25:57.427
that put you in places
you shouldn't be.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.051
Video too,
of the power plant

25:59.142 --> 26:01.098
when Liber8
killed our strike team,
of the time you were...

26:01.185 --> 26:03.221
Can you erase them?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.563
Nora and Gardiner
locked me out.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.393
There's a data team
hacking my firewalls
as we speak.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.643
It's only
a matter of time.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.310
There's a program
on here that will
execute a full system wipe.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.317
If I can get
into your office.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.945
Okay.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.030
Betty?

26:27.044 --> 26:28.500
What else
is in those files?

26:29.922 --> 26:31.537
I went to a Liber8
meeting once,

26:31.632 --> 26:33.543
it was
a grassroots thing,

26:33.843 --> 26:34.958
research for Dillon.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.173
But it wasn't
exactly sanctioned.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.630
They'll think
you're the mole.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.185
I'm in deep shit, too.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.227

my weapon systems.

26:47.315 --> 26:48.521

26:48.649 --> 26:49.604
I am unable
to clear you,

26:49.692 --> 26:51.102
your root
problem remains.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.434
This can't wait.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.860
A good officer
might be arrested
forjust doing herjob.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.528
You need to deal
with your loss.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.528
To tackle head on
the underlying cause
of your anxiety.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.701
And more importantly,
yourgth

27:01.954 --> 27:02.943
What guilt?

27:03.039 --> 27:05.997
Kiera, you abandoned
yourcth.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.218
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

27:23.935 --> 27:25.721
Does this look
like 2077?

27:28.940 --> 27:31.431
The office does
appear archaic.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.395
Get in touch
with your duty, Officer.

27:36.864 --> 27:37.853
You can't, can you?

27:39.075 --> 27:41.066
Because CPS doesn't
exist in the past.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.116
Butlspoke
with Alec Sadler.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.944
Eighteen-year-old
Alec Sadler.

27:45.790 --> 27:47.405
He hasn't even
invented you yet.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.917
I am having issues
connecting with
the CPS servers.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.680
I have traveled
back in time.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.975
I have left behind everybody
I ever cared about.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.638
So tell me, please,
how exactly am I
supposed to function?

28:09.856 --> 28:10.936
That's an
excellent question.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.685
Are you going
to answer it?

28:13.776 --> 28:15.277
lfthis is 2013...

28:16.654 --> 28:18.610
Then your program
doesn't apply to me.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.356
I can't be evaluated
because there is no CPS.

28:21.617 --> 28:22.823
NORA: Betty Robertson?

28:23.953 --> 28:24.988
Can you join us?

28:26.080 --> 28:27.115
Cameron.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.118
You're still not
off the hook.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.052
Betty, the Liber8 mole?
Come on.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.629
Take a seat.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.811
You want to tell Carlos
what we found?

28:53.816 --> 28:55.352
There are a number
of protected files

28:55.443 --> 28:56.808
hidden on
Betty's hard drive.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.518
We haven't been able
to open them all yet,

28:59.530 --> 29:01.316
but the one
that we did
was illuminating.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.991
You attended
a Liber8 meeting.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.275
Betty?

29:09.624 --> 29:11.455
Yeah. lwent
to a low level meeting.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.203
But only to find out
how they organized.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.333
But why bother
when you've got
Kiera and Section 6

29:15.421 --> 29:16.536
feeding you this
great information?

29:16.631 --> 29:18.462
Because Dillon
wanted to infiltrate
the group.

29:18.549 --> 29:19.538
I was just
doing myjob.

29:19.675 --> 29:20.630
Then explain why
there's no record

29:20.718 --> 29:22.174
of Dillon ever giving
such an order.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.762
Well, it's in the files.

29:25.723 --> 29:28.931
I saw it. I did, Carlos,
I swear.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.183
You know
there's no file, Betty.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.309
Take her to holding.
No, there's a file
in there!

29:36.400 --> 29:38.140
This is ridiculous.
Formal charges pending.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.979
You just
haventlooked”.
Okay, just let me...

29:40.071 --> 29:42.062
I'll find this file for you.
MAN: This meeting is over,
Miss Robertson.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.397
Listen, you just
haven't found the file,
there's a file in there!

29:45.409 --> 29:46.660
Are you freaking
kidding me?

29:46.994 --> 29:48.029
Are you joking?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.202
You're going to take
me away because
Dillon gave the order?

29:50.373 --> 29:51.863
I don't know
where you come from?

29:51.958 --> 29:52.947
Just call Dillon!

29:53.042 --> 29:55.579
Dillon can't help
you now, Miss Robertson.
Just call Dillon, Carlos.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.956
Did Dillon mention
anything about sending
Betty to those meetings?

29:58.047 --> 29:59.127
You're out of line,
Gardiner.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.163
Did he say
anything to you?

30:01.801 --> 30:03.917
This is a mistake,
and it's going
to get handled.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.713
There's only
one question left.

30:06.263 --> 30:07.719
Was Cameron in
on itwith her?

30:10.226 --> 30:11.215
(SCOFFS)

30:14.230 --> 30:17.222

I need my systems back.

(SIGHING)

30:26.617 --> 30:27.993
All right.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.198
I think about him
every day.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.119
Every move I make,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.038
I wonder,
does this hurt him?

30:39.005 --> 30:40.245
Am I harming him?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.042
And then it gets worse.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.085
I love him so much,

30:47.179 --> 30:48.760
and I don't even know
if he lives.

30:49.598 --> 30:50.633
That's all theory.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.095
Not to me.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.935
All those questions
that can never
be answered.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.230
In that way,
madness lies.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.730
All you have to do
is open your heart.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.979
I can't.
I know it hurts.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.782
It will destroy me.

31:12.455 --> 31:13.695
Because?

31:13.789 --> 31:16.121
Because I left him.

31:18.753 --> 31:19.993
I didn't even say goodbye.

31:21.756 --> 31:23.087
You know
how kids are, they...

31:24.300 --> 31:26.962
No, you don't.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.418
So I'll tell you.

31:30.014 --> 31:33.427
They always think
it's their fault.

31:34.643 --> 31:35.803
I'm the one that left.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.722
That died.

31:39.273 --> 31:42.140
And I know that
Sam lies awake
in bed every night

31:44.153 --> 31:45.734
thinking that
there was something
he could have done

31:45.821 --> 31:47.652
to keep me from going
to work that day.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.162
So tell him
it's not his fault.

(GASPING)

32:03.923 --> 32:04.958

that exists in your mind.

32:08.302 --> 32:09.291
Pulled from your memories.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.670
You seem to want to keep
these memories, Kiera.

32:14.683 --> 32:15.889
So use them.

really hard to get
back to you,

and now
I'm not sure I can.

that you must
think I'm dead,

32:45.631 --> 32:48.373
and lwant to tell you
so badly that I'm not.

I'm sorry that
I didn't get
to say goodbye.

32:55.558 --> 32:59.801
I would never,
ever leave you.

happened to me.

be with you.

I will always be with you.

33:25.796 --> 33:27.127
I promise.

to let you go.

I love you, Sam.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.032
But you didn't
let him go.

33:55.284 --> 33:56.399
No, I never will.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.447
Perhaps you don't
haveto,

34:01.123 --> 34:02.488
but something has
to change.

34:05.294 --> 34:06.329
I know.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.296
l have to accept the truth

34:15.429 --> 34:17.135
that I may never
get back to him.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.929
It doesn't mean
I have to stop trying.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.810
But it means I have
to accept that I may
never get there.

34:32.154 --> 34:33.439
The cuff's unnecessary.

straightened out.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.011
Some new information
has come to light

36:31.106 --> 36:32.266
that you should be
aware of.

36:33.484 --> 36:34.849
We think that
Betty's the mole,

36:36.737 --> 36:37.852
and that
you're working together.

36:37.946 --> 36:38.935
(CHUCKUNG)

36:39.031 --> 36:42.068
A very thorough review
of this unit's case files

36:42.159 --> 36:43.569
revealed that Betty
was the only person,

36:43.660 --> 36:46.117
other than you
and Fonnegra and Dillon,

36:47.289 --> 36:49.746
who handled information
relating to Section 6.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.991
Starting with the day
your cover story
first appeared online.

36:52.336 --> 36:53.416
Yeah, we checked.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.836
Section 6 didn't exist
before Betty went
looking for it.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.798
Take your time.
But not too long.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.926
We found some
additional files
on Betty's hard drives.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.554
Care to comment
on what's in them?

37:10.396 --> 37:11.476
Pass.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.808
I'd hoped you'd be
smarter than this.

37:15.651 --> 37:17.141
(SOFTLY)
I'm really glad
you weren't.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.570
Kiera, you're back!

37:23.158 --> 37:24.409
What were you doing?

37:25.536 --> 37:27.197
Don’t you want to hear
my side of the story?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.827
My data team has
Betty's passwords.

37:33.252 --> 37:34.537
Once we find
the connections,

37:35.045 --> 37:36.706
anything you have
to say will be moot.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.083
If those files
even exist.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.755
Well, they exist, all right.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.003
Gardiner.
Hmm?

37:42.261 --> 37:43.626
Oh, that was for me.
Got it.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.635
Looks like
you beat me to it,
those files are gone.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.351
No, that's impossible.

37:55.816 --> 37:58.853
Hold on,
there's a Trojan horse
in her root directory.

37:59.695 --> 38:00.730
It’s a nasty one.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.403
It's set up to
send out information
on the VPD server.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.772
A virus.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.691
The code is written
to leave a trail
like someone would

38:07.786 --> 38:09.322
if they were sending
the information.

38:10.539 --> 38:11.528
What did you say?

38:11.748 --> 38:15.081
Liber8 put an electronic mole
in place that framed Betty
when itwas found!

38:16.712 --> 38:19.954
Liber8 embedded
a Trojan virus
to make it appear

38:20.048 --> 38:21.584
Betty was feeding
them information.

38:22.426 --> 38:26.044
The truth is,
theyjust set her up
to cover their intentions.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.054
Check it out.

38:29.766 --> 38:30.846
I'll shut it down.

38:31.143 --> 38:32.929
No. Make it obvious.

38:33.729 --> 38:34.809
Make what obvious?

38:34.938 --> 38:35.973
That's a great idea!

38:36.732 --> 38:37.721
And with
a few improvements,

38:37.816 --> 38:39.226
I'll control the flow
of information.

38:40.068 --> 38:43.606
The perfect mole
is the one you think
you've caught.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.357
The obvious one.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.575
In reality, you've just
let your guard down
to the real danger.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.246
You should be
seeing the Trojan
pop-up now.

38:58.837 --> 38:59.826
She's right.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.002
It's good to have
you back, Kiera.

39:19.942 --> 39:21.352
Miss Robertson
is free to go.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.522
We still need
to discuss your family.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.186
Section 6.

39:26.782 --> 39:27.817
Tell me to go.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.439
Excuse me?

39:30.118 --> 39:31.574
Have me escorted
out of the building.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.659
You have the power
to do that.

39:34.790 --> 39:37.122
I am under no obligation
to prove anything to you

39:37.209 --> 39:39.746
because technically,
I do not work here.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.040
Ask anyone
in this building

39:43.131 --> 39:45.292
if they would
rather have me
alongside them or not,

39:45.676 --> 39:46.791
and then
do what you want.

39:47.636 --> 39:48.751
But enough dancing
around the issue.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.972
The call is yours.
Make it.

40:01.984 --> 40:03.815
Remind me never to play
poker with you.

40:21.169 --> 40:22.124
What are you doing here?

40:22.212 --> 40:23.497
I've been waiting for you!

40:27.134 --> 40:28.465
I knew you'd be thinking
about my offer,

40:28.552 --> 40:29.712
I didn't want
to miss the boat.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.878
Why did you give me
those diagrams?

40:33.348 --> 40:35.634
Because I wanted
you to know
I was for real

40:35.726 --> 40:37.762
and that I had
something to offer
in my offer.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.097
Yeah.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.854
Jason, did you have
something to do with
that time travel device?

40:43.025 --> 40:44.686
Well, I... I know it.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.478
I mean, I knew it.
No, I know it.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.352
You know it better.
You will know it.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.778
Do you think we could
start working on those
schematics first thing?

40:54.536 --> 40:56.367
If we're lucky,
and ifyou're interested,

40:56.872 --> 40:59.113
we might even be able
to reverse engineer
a way home for you.

41:00.334 --> 41:01.369
Reverse engineer?

41:03.170 --> 41:04.501
I know somebody
who would love that.

41:04.713 --> 41:05.873
Yeah, me too.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.713
Wanna start now?
Yeah.

41:20.020 --> 41:21.885
Retinal scanner, juicy.

41:31.073 --> 41:32.404
CARLOS: Hey, you okay?

41:32.783 --> 41:33.898
I'm good.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.320
I can't thank you
enough for today.

41:38.580 --> 41:40.411
You can...
You can owe me one.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.202
Done.

41:44.336 --> 41:45.917
Good night.
KIERA: Good night, Betty.

41:46.546 --> 41:49.413
Carlos, (CHUCKLES) I'm fine.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.248
Go home.

41:52.386 --> 41:53.421
Okay.

42:20.372 --> 42:21.578
I love you, Sam.

42:32.801 --> 42:34.337
Happy birthday.

43:01.121 --> 43:02.406
MAN: How'd it go?

43:04.166 --> 43:05.201
I'm here, aren't I?
