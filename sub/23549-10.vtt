WEBVTT

00:16.320 --> 00:19.160
-It belongs to me.
-[door thudding]

00:19.240 --> 00:22.640
You stole the scroll
and tortured gods to translate it.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.960
It does not belong to you.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.400
[Davari] Look...

00:27.000 --> 00:28.560
you can't stop me now.

00:28.640 --> 00:29.880
-Hey!
-[Tripitaka grunts]

00:32.280 --> 00:33.120
Hey!

00:34.120 --> 00:35.360
Open this door!

00:46.280 --> 00:49.720
[Silver] Swords, daggers. Pack it up.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.400
Demons from all over
are here for this banquet.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.360
If they become immortal,

01:03.920 --> 01:06.080
there'll be no return
to the way things were.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.720
We will not let this happen.

01:08.520 --> 01:10.040
We need a disguise
to get into the banquet.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.240
I've been telling you, that's the plan.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.280
In the theater, it's called a costume.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.160
We shall ambush them.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.400
-What is this?
-Guard two, for the play.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.240
[Monkey] And who are you?

01:20.320 --> 01:21.640
I will play...

01:21.720 --> 01:22.920
the Monkey King.

01:23.560 --> 01:24.880
-[Monkey grunts]
-Hey! Hey!

01:25.520 --> 01:29.440
I auditioned. I attended rehearsals.
The part is mine. Thank you.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.760
This... No... [sighs]

01:31.840 --> 01:33.960
We are gods, not actors.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.600
-This is--
-The only way get you into the banquet.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.760
Trust the plan.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.000
[Sandy] Have you seen
any strangers around?

01:49.080 --> 01:50.240
Probably hiding out?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.000
Are you sure?

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
Carry on.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.960
It's rude to spit.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.919
[boys laugh]

02:09.639 --> 02:11.920
[Davari] All translated.

02:13.040 --> 02:18.760
"And so no demon
shall ever look upon these words."

02:19.280 --> 02:20.840
[sighs] Well...

02:21.360 --> 02:22.360
[laughs]

02:23.200 --> 02:25.200
[door opens]

02:26.680 --> 02:28.440
-Excuse me, sir.
-What?

02:28.520 --> 02:31.680
We haven't quite managed
to locate the little girl.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.520
Or the Monkey King.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.920
[sighs] Okay. Come here.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.040
[clears throat] Come.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
[clears throat]

02:48.280 --> 02:50.800
Now, listen to me.

02:50.880 --> 02:54.440
This is my final moment, okay?

02:54.520 --> 02:59.040
This is... This is my, uh,
transcendence to a higher plane.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.760
To immortality.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.960
And I will not have Monkey ruin it.

03:05.040 --> 03:11.680
So I want every guard we have patrolling,
and you will find them.

03:11.760 --> 03:12.880
Yes, sir!

03:15.240 --> 03:16.520
[Davari sighs]

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
[grunts]

03:26.560 --> 03:28.160
Bye... [clears throat]

03:28.240 --> 03:30.360
my wise old blobs.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.560
See, this is what happens
when you get soft.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.720
Comfortable.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.280
Oh, and thanks.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.800
Find the prisoner and the Monkey King.

03:47.880 --> 03:48.880
[guards grunting assent]

03:54.280 --> 03:56.280
[indistinct chatter]

04:00.360 --> 04:01.720
How will we get into the palace?

04:02.360 --> 04:04.560
Yeah, Monkey, if you'd attended rehearsal,

04:04.640 --> 04:06.680
I wouldn't have to go through this
every single time.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.120
-Okay.
-You know?

04:08.200 --> 04:11.000
I got it. I got the plan.
But what about Tripitaka?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.080
There's no plan past the banquet.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.440
Okay, one step at a time.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.640
If we take down Davari,
the palace is ours.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.440
Pigsy, we're onstage in five.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.880
I'm on my way.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.000
[sighs] There's something you don't know.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.480
[sighs]

04:34.400 --> 04:35.480
Tripitaka...

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
is a girl.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.120
Yeah.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.080
All along she's been
pretending to be a boy.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.880
Okay.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.960
Did she tell you why?

04:50.800 --> 04:52.520
Pigsy, she was born that way.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.440
No, Monkey, not why is she a girl,
why she was pretending to be a boy.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.200
Oh.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.000
I didn't have time to find out.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.720
Do you still trust her?

05:04.800 --> 05:06.320
-Tripitaka?
-Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
Yes.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.800
And I believe in him.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.760
Her.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.320
We all have history we're not so proud of.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.400
We've all done things
that we have to hide from.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.080
I trust in her deeds and actions.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.040
Hey, wait. Uh...

05:25.160 --> 05:26.320
Sorry. Just...

05:27.320 --> 05:28.760
-Okay.
-Thank you.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.560
I am the strongest god in the known world!

05:35.640 --> 05:36.640
[demons booing]

05:36.720 --> 05:38.880
-Ha-ha! So you keep telling everyone.
-[gasps]

05:38.960 --> 05:40.040
[demons laughing]

05:40.120 --> 05:43.040
I will take that crown,
and this palace will be mine!

05:43.120 --> 05:44.920
Watch how good I am.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.040
[both grunting]

05:48.080 --> 05:50.360
[demons exclaiming]

05:50.440 --> 05:51.920
But as the Monkey King was prancing

05:52.000 --> 05:54.720
like he loved himself more
than he loved the world...

05:54.800 --> 05:58.880
and while hot air came from his mouth,
rather than the wisdom of the ages...

06:02.160 --> 06:05.160
-[farting]
-[demons laughing]

06:05.240 --> 06:07.760
-[coughs and chokes]
-Give me this.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.280
[Lusio] ...a hero rose.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.560
A hero rose to save us all.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.000
[demon] It's Davari!

06:13.080 --> 06:15.520
-This world needs new blood, new wisdom.
-[cheering]

06:15.600 --> 06:18.520
A new age is dawning,
and we are here to take it.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.480
Farewell old ways.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.840
[Shamai grunts]

06:22.920 --> 06:24.600
Just do what I do. Come on.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.560
[continues groaning]

06:26.640 --> 06:28.680
[demons laughing]

06:28.760 --> 06:31.120
[demons cheering]

06:33.320 --> 06:35.720
[demons laughing]

06:35.800 --> 06:37.280
[cheering]

06:38.480 --> 06:43.320
And I shall survey our wonderful world
from my amazing flying cloud.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.600
[cheering continues]

07:02.240 --> 07:03.720
[sighs] I have to get you out of here.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
No, leave us.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
You must stop him.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.880
We have given you the means of control.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.280
Control of what?

07:12.280 --> 07:15.520
I can't square up to a demon.
I'm just human.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.480
[door opens]

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
Go.

07:18.640 --> 07:22.360
You have all the answers.
Don't get caught here. Now go.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.480
And who... might you be?

07:32.840 --> 07:35.080
[Sandy] Uh, I'm Sandborg.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
The guard.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.640
Run along then, Sandborg.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.560
Tonight is a momentous occasion
for all of us.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.880
-But I'm here! I'm here!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Name?

07:56.960 --> 07:59.760
Locke. Princess Locke.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.280
Well, hello, there.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.040
Do not do anything stupid.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.680
-What are you talking about?
-[Locke] Whoo!

08:17.760 --> 08:19.040
I'm fine.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.800
I'm fine.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.680
[Locke laughing]

08:25.760 --> 08:28.040
Ooh, so flirty.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.600
Ooh, I do like a good big un.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.039
Cheers! You're very beautiful.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
[laughing]

08:54.120 --> 08:56.400
[playing aggressive melody]

09:17.960 --> 09:18.960
Tripitaka!

09:25.800 --> 09:28.720
[laughter and indistinct chatter]

09:34.400 --> 09:36.040
[chatter stops]

09:36.120 --> 09:37.480
[footsteps approaching]

09:40.960 --> 09:43.400
Good evening, friends!

09:48.840 --> 09:51.360
Please... sit. Sit.

09:52.560 --> 09:53.840
[sighs]

09:54.640 --> 09:55.640
Well...

09:56.520 --> 09:59.520
Welcome, rulers...

10:00.120 --> 10:03.960
from each corner of the world
to the center of the universe.

10:05.600 --> 10:11.560
Now, what is the difference
between a god and a demon?

10:13.400 --> 10:16.160
We both have powers, skill sets

10:16.240 --> 10:19.920
and some magic potential
that our dear humans do not have.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.360
[sighs]

10:22.440 --> 10:25.480
And it's big and it's unfair.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.280
But demons only live for 600 years,

10:30.360 --> 10:32.880
and gods get infinity...

10:32.960 --> 10:37.120
-[demons exclaiming]
-...immortality, foreverness!

10:37.200 --> 10:38.640
Not right.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.040
Not fair.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.600
And now, my dear friends...

10:48.800 --> 10:49.880
not anymore.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.640
-Argh!
-[Shamai] No!

11:06.360 --> 11:08.640
-[Davari] What were you thinking, hmm?
-[Shamai] Silver! Oak!

11:08.720 --> 11:10.960
You could just sneak in here
and I wouldn't even know?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.200
-No!
-[Davari] Huh?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.120
-[Silver] Let go!
-[Shamai] Please!

11:17.520 --> 11:19.280
[panting]

11:32.000 --> 11:35.560
Control his power... control them.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.400
Hey, you!

11:47.000 --> 11:49.400
-[scuffle]
-[guard groans]

11:56.080 --> 11:57.320
Sandy.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
The sentinels.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
We must destroy them.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.360
No!

12:06.560 --> 12:08.200
They're Davari's power.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
There must be a way to wake them up.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.560
It's all just been a wonderful dream.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.640
[demons chuckle]

12:33.720 --> 12:37.960
Fate brought my old pal back here,
just let him into my house.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.160
[chuckles] And even better, he brought
with him a monk who could translate...

12:43.280 --> 12:46.480
and make me immortal.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.240
[exhales heavily]

13:12.680 --> 13:14.160
Why is it not working?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.680
It's a magic spell.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.560
Don't magic spells need ingredients?

13:24.360 --> 13:25.880
The little packages.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.960
"We have given you the means of control."

13:34.120 --> 13:35.920
The hair of a god.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.480
[chanting]

13:49.840 --> 13:51.040
[gasps]

13:54.080 --> 13:55.320
[softly] They are awake.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.360
I know what to do now.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.320
Time to turn enemies into friends.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.080
[Pigsy] Move it!

14:21.600 --> 14:23.480
[Monkey] I have to do something.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.920
[Pigsy] There's nothing you can do.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.320
[demon grunts]

15:08.440 --> 15:09.960
[Davari] Argh!

15:11.480 --> 15:15.120
What's this, hmm? [panting]

15:16.560 --> 15:21.360
What orders would bring you
to my banquet, huh?

15:21.440 --> 15:23.920
Destroy Davari.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.240
[growls] Guards!

15:34.520 --> 15:35.600
Let's do this.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.160
[all grunting]

15:55.520 --> 15:58.280
Oak! Silver! Quickly, come with me.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.440
[grunts]

16:08.040 --> 16:09.400
[groans]

16:16.000 --> 16:17.120
[groans]

16:24.640 --> 16:26.080
[all grunting]

16:26.720 --> 16:28.280
Pigsy, my love.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.720
Princess.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.040
How did you get out of the cart?

16:32.680 --> 16:36.360
They drove me around for three days
and then left me in a ditch.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.720
And that's where I stayed...

16:38.320 --> 16:43.160
until one of Davari's handsome patrolmen
found me, and here I am.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.120
Pigsy, this is hardly the time!

16:46.680 --> 16:49.960
Oh, yes, this is exactly the time.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.400
That's my boy.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.680

-[groans]

16:55.400 --> 16:58.440

-[grunts]

17:13.599 --> 17:15.119
[groans]

17:17.640 --> 17:19.760
[groaning]

17:44.320 --> 17:45.680
Good of you to make an appearance.

17:46.240 --> 17:47.720
You missed me, didn't you?

17:47.800 --> 17:49.640
I'm not so sure about that.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
Where's Tripitaka?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.120
And Davari?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.520
I know where they'll be.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.160
[Locke shrieks]

18:06.040 --> 18:07.800
[both grunting]

18:14.120 --> 18:15.640
[screams]

18:24.880 --> 18:26.840
Let's finish this, shall we?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.840
[mutters]

18:32.960 --> 18:33.960
[sighs]

18:38.400 --> 18:41.360
I'm not gonna fight you. [grunts]

18:42.720 --> 18:44.120
Those powers are not for you.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.840
Uh, shaman.

18:48.480 --> 18:49.560
[shaman] Monkey.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.360
You have a wonderful choice.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.480
[gasps]

18:57.800 --> 19:02.160
I will send the little human to its death
if you touch a hair on his head.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.600
-It's over.
-[Tripitaka] Stop him, Monkey.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.240
We have to stop him!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.240
Let...

19:17.320 --> 19:18.760
her...

19:18.840 --> 19:20.000
go.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.920
Or what?

19:26.520 --> 19:27.880
[tsk-tsks]

19:35.760 --> 19:37.280
[Tripitaka screams]

19:38.960 --> 19:40.200
[Sandy] Monkey!

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
[thunder rumbling]

19:58.920 --> 20:01.520
Whoo! [sighing heavily]

20:08.120 --> 20:10.000
-Is it done?
-Yes.

20:10.720 --> 20:14.960
You are the first demon
to achieve immortality.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.320
Ah!

20:59.840 --> 21:02.360
[straining]

21:13.000 --> 21:14.120
[both groan]

21:17.640 --> 21:18.640
[beeping]

21:21.840 --> 21:23.120
[straining]

21:23.200 --> 21:25.840
-[grunting]
-[beeping intensifies]

21:27.960 --> 21:28.920
[Sandy groans]

21:29.880 --> 21:32.200
Davari, you may be immortal,
but you'll never be free.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.360
[grunts]

21:40.600 --> 21:43.440
[both grunting and panting]

21:45.680 --> 21:48.920
[Davari shrieking]

21:49.000 --> 21:50.760
[shrieking continues]

21:52.600 --> 21:54.240
[Davari screaming]

21:59.280 --> 22:01.440
[screaming intensifies]

22:07.640 --> 22:09.120
[screaming continues]

22:13.040 --> 22:15.440
[sighs] It's done.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.600
Thank you, wise monk.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.880
I'm not a monk.
And I'm sure I'm not very wise.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.920
You are as brave as any god.

22:23.000 --> 22:23.840
No.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.880
Braver.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.520
Our journey's not over.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.360
There are more scrolls we must find
to take to the Western Mountains.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.280
Ah, good.
I was starting to get a little bored.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.160
Could stay a couple of days, though.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.840
You know, take stock,
grab a massage or a haircut.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
So, uh...

22:45.640 --> 22:48.440
now that you are someone else,
what do we call you?

22:53.040 --> 22:54.080
I'm Tripitaka.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.840
[theme music playing]
