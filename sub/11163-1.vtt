14:41.423 --> 14:44.551
I actually like it.

14:44.843 --> 14:47.929
Well, thank you.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.683
Ew...

14:51.975 --> 14:55.103
Die!

14:57.188 --> 14:59.149
I can't believe I've
spent my whole summer

14:59.441 --> 15:01.902
with my hand up
a chicken's ass.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.862
Actually, I've
enjoyed it.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.031
Must be second nature.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.073
Excuse me, please.

15:07.365 --> 15:07.824
Grubbers!

15:08.158 --> 15:10.368
It's going to be a busy,
inconvenient day,

15:10.660 --> 15:13.788
so make that
cuttage quick.

15:16.416 --> 15:20.962
Lover god.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.172
Coolness.

15:22.464 --> 15:26.801
My little lovey, he's
getting so handsome.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.011
Mag cut it.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.056
You look like
David Bowie.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.017
Give me a hand?

15:39.481 --> 15:42.067
Pie break!

15:42.359 --> 15:44.945
Rod, shit, they
could fire you.

15:45.236 --> 15:45.695
Fuck 'em.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.948
Summer's almost over.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.621
Can't forget the
whipped cream.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.311
Oh.

16:27.529 --> 16:31.616
I love your hair.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.848
(laughter)

16:55.140 --> 16:56.516
When you were out
on break today,

16:56.808 --> 16:59.102
we all had to clean
the chicken oven

16:59.394 --> 17:03.106
and Angie started going
around asking everybody

17:03.398 --> 17:05.733
about their first time.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.152
Having sex?

17:07.444 --> 17:10.155
Yeah, what else does
Angie ever talk about?

17:10.446 --> 17:13.157
And Frieda freaked
out and ran off

17:13.450 --> 17:14.200
and was hiding
in the walk-in.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.744
And then Angie turns,
Angie turns to me

17:17.037 --> 17:20.165
in front of everybody
and she goes,

17:20.457 --> 17:25.170
"Lovey, how is your
cherry situation?"

17:25.462 --> 17:30.300
What did you say?

17:30.592 --> 17:33.178
Um.

17:33.470 --> 17:38.183
Don't, don't be mad.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.185
What?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.187
What?

17:42.479 --> 17:46.566
I said that we did it.

17:46.858 --> 17:50.028
You and me?

17:50.320 --> 17:55.200
Mm-hmm.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.367
What was I
supposed to say?

17:56.659 --> 18:01.623
In front of everybody, yes, we
are total sexual rejects?

18:01.915 --> 18:04.667
Here you go,
try and enjoy it.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.004
That was really nice.

18:15.345 --> 18:19.390
Oh, come on.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.227
Eric, don't hate me.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.436
Maggie, please.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.979
I don't hate you.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.233
That's...

18:35.240 --> 18:38.243
Would it be that bad?

18:42.622 --> 18:47.043
No, it wouldn't
be bad, it's...

18:47.335 --> 18:50.213
It's like...

18:56.427 --> 19:00.265
I mean...

19:00.557 --> 19:01.558
Hmm.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.269
You should have seen
Rod's face though,

19:04.561 --> 19:08.273
when I said it.

19:08.565 --> 19:13.778
I think he was jealous.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.531
Of what?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.241
I think he likes you.

19:18.533 --> 19:19.367
No he does not.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.285
Why are you
being weird?

19:20.577 --> 19:21.286
Shut up, I'm not
being weird.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.871
You are being so weird.
I'm not.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.289
Yes you are.
I am not.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.290
Yes you are.

19:25.582 --> 19:25.915
I am not.

19:26.249 --> 19:30.545

21:01.886 --> 21:03.554
Oh no, there you go!

21:07.600 --> 21:12.397
Summer's over, grubbers,
deal with it.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.857
Frieda is toast.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.486
Oh, she is wasted.

21:22.323 --> 21:25.368
Oh, what?

21:25.660 --> 21:27.578
Oh my God.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.663
Hey, Eric.

Eric!

Drop a basket of

Oh.

22:11.664 --> 22:12.081
Hey.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.250
Did I do that?

22:14.542 --> 22:18.254
He always has
zipper trouble.

22:24.802 --> 22:29.474
Frieda, I don't feel good.

22:29.766 --> 22:35.396
Don't feel good.

22:35.688 --> 22:40.568
I'm sick.

23:01.589 --> 23:06.511
(whispering)
Maggie...

23:06.803 --> 23:10.056
Maggie.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.106
(Rod)
No, I gotta do
something first.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.524
(woman)
You have to come though.

23:19.816 --> 23:20.775
(Rod)
Maybe I'll meet you later.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.611
(woman) See you there.
(Rod) Okay.

23:23.903 --> 23:28.449
(man on PA)
Ladies and gentlemen,
the park gate will be closing

23:28.741 --> 23:29.534
in approximately

23:29.826 --> 23:30.952
We thank you for
your patronage

23:31.244 --> 23:34.163
and hope to see you
back next season.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.915
Thank you.

23:36.207 --> 23:39.502
Ladies and gentlemen, the parkgate will be
closing...

23:39.794 --> 23:42.046
Hey, little boy.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.632
Hi.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.138
Heading out?

23:50.430 --> 23:51.931
Yeah.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.560
You want to get
out of here?

23:55.852 --> 23:59.355
Say goodbye?

24:07.655 --> 24:11.325
(laughing)

24:15.955 --> 24:17.457
(Eric)
Do you want to
go to the party?

24:17.748 --> 24:21.461
(Rod)
Uh, I think we should
get something to eat.

24:21.752 --> 24:22.879
(Eric)
Yes.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.213
So you want
cheese fries?

24:24.505 --> 24:26.674
I want cheese fries,
yes, I do.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.592
No, no, no.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.344
What?
Come on, my treat.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.597
This is a proper date.

24:32.889 --> 24:35.808
Well, thank you.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.655
Yay!

25:30.947 --> 25:32.907
Dinner time.

25:33.199 --> 25:33.866
Mmm.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.619
Did you put on
my cologne?

25:36.911 --> 25:37.411
No.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.997
Um, I mean I just like,
opened it up.

25:40.289 --> 25:44.669
I wanted to see what
it smelled like.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.171
You did.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.216
I'm sorry.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.718
I did.

26:01.852 --> 26:05.690
I'm gonna miss you.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.025
You are?

26:08.317 --> 26:12.405
Yeah.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.699
Well, from the
way it looks,

26:14.991 --> 26:18.953
I'm gonna end up at Ohio
State with you next year.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.707
You're gonna make
me wait that long.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.631
What do we do?

26:30.923 --> 26:34.802
Let's go someplace else.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.521
Close your eyes.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.964
Now open.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.930
Oh, man.

29:28.309 --> 29:32.938
Oh, no, where
are you going?

29:33.230 --> 29:36.233
Come here.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.521
You'd make the
coolest boyfriend.

30:18.901 --> 30:22.029
I--

30:36.001 --> 30:38.379
Turn around.

30:38.671 --> 30:42.383
Those look nice.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.427
One more to go.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.346
Hey.

30:47.638 --> 30:48.138
Hey.

30:48.430 --> 30:49.974
You survived, huh?

30:50.266 --> 30:52.268
(Mom)
How was it?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.270
It was fine.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.855
I got school clothes!

30:56.146 --> 30:56.605
Yeah.

30:56.897 --> 31:00.693
Was it hard to
say goodbye?

31:00.985 --> 31:03.946
No, well, yeah.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.865
It was fine.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.784
Wanna try on a few things?

31:09.076 --> 31:10.911
Can I do it later?

31:11.203 --> 31:13.289
A little worn out?

31:13.622 --> 31:14.039
Yeah.

31:14.331 --> 31:20.004
(Mom)
Just don't forget
school in the morning.

31:20.296 --> 31:23.924
Why doesn't he
have to do it?

31:24.216 --> 31:27.469
I lied, one more.

33:13.117 --> 33:16.996
Yes, I've been dying.

33:17.287 --> 33:17.663
I just wrote this.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.041
I haven't even played
it for Maggie yet.

33:30.592 --> 33:33.762
(synthesizer music)

33:49.570 --> 33:51.155
Well, it's not finished yet.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.532
And it'll get a lot better.

33:53.824 --> 33:56.744
Eric, it's
really good.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.163
Really good.

33:59.455 --> 34:00.039
Thank you.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.248
Kind of different.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.626
Little more serious maybe.

34:04.918 --> 34:11.132
Just remember I taught you
everything you know.

34:11.425 --> 34:14.178
You never play anymore.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.304
Do you regret giving that up?

34:16.597 --> 34:19.766
Dropping out of
college and stuff?

34:20.059 --> 34:22.061
Hm.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.813
Sometimes.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.193
But I met your dad.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.695
I always wanted a family.

34:36.658 --> 34:37.909
Ooh.

34:38.202 --> 34:43.791
Trigonometry.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.126
When you met Dad,

34:46.418 --> 34:49.505
did you know right away that,

34:49.797 --> 34:53.217
you know, that you guys
would end up together?

34:53.509 --> 34:58.055
Didn't take long.

34:58.347 --> 35:03.268
How did you know when
you were in love?

35:08.273 --> 35:11.568
When I thought about
him so much it hurt.

35:16.115 --> 35:19.868
How come?

35:20.160 --> 35:24.331
We talking about
someone I know?

35:38.929 --> 35:42.599
(phone beeping)

35:48.105 --> 35:50.274
(phone ringing)

35:50.566 --> 35:51.275
Hello?

35:51.608 --> 35:52.109
Rod?

35:52.401 --> 35:53.277
No, this is his roommate.

35:53.569 --> 35:54.278
Who's this?

35:54.570 --> 35:56.363
Um, it's Eric.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.281
Is Rod there?

35:57.573 --> 36:00.951
Uh, let me see if
he's down the hall.

36:01.243 --> 36:02.202
Hey, Rod?

36:02.494 --> 36:04.371
Rod!

36:09.168 --> 36:11.545
Hey, Eric, he says
he'll call you back.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.505
Does he have your number?

36:13.797 --> 36:16.884
Yeah, thanks.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.876
What's that smell?

36:51.168 --> 36:55.047
(gasps)
The rolls!

36:55.339 --> 36:57.591
Friday?

37:08.602 --> 37:10.354
Close your eyes.

37:10.646 --> 37:14.149
Close your eyes.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.827
Okay, open.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.287
Oh, God.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.832
What?

37:31.124 --> 37:33.835
It's getting a
bit out of hand.

37:34.127 --> 37:37.923
I thought you'd like it.

37:38.215 --> 37:41.385
Dinner's on the table.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.220
Maggie, you staying?

37:43.512 --> 37:46.306
No, I gotta go.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.401
How did you start
wearing makeup?

37:57.693 --> 38:00.487
Hey, brought you
some dessert.

Oh.

38:02.197 --> 38:05.242
Scoot over.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.422
That is some hairdo.

38:18.714 --> 38:21.425
Thanks.

38:21.717 --> 38:22.676
I mean, really outrageous.

38:22.968 --> 38:27.848
I think I was dressed up even
more when I went out to...

38:28.140 --> 38:30.309
What are you watching?

38:30.600 --> 38:35.022
Oh, just some
interview show.

38:35.314 --> 38:38.275
But my father...

38:38.567 --> 38:41.194
So now, this New York thing.

38:41.486 --> 38:45.282
You really
serious about it?

38:45.574 --> 38:47.451
Yeah.

38:50.912 --> 38:55.208
I only wear it
because they...

38:58.128 --> 38:59.588
Listen, uh,

38:59.880 --> 39:03.550
I haven't said much
to you and the kids,

39:03.842 --> 39:07.554
but, uh, the
business has been

39:07.846 --> 39:13.310
a little tough the
last couple of years.

39:13.602 --> 39:16.063
I mean, I keep trying
different things

39:16.355 --> 39:18.482
and it seems like
no matter what I do,

39:18.774 --> 39:23.403
I just can't get
it back on track.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.698
Maybe it's the economy,
I don't know.

39:26.990 --> 39:27.407
Listen, Dad, um--

39:27.699 --> 39:33.121
Look, your mother and I are
going to send you to New York.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.664
She didn't want me
to tell you this,

39:34.956 --> 39:39.378
but, uh, she decided
to get a job.

39:41.671 --> 39:42.089

of the night.

53:25.620 --> 53:29.332
I just slept with somebody.

53:29.624 --> 53:30.166
Uh.

53:30.458 --> 53:35.046
I went out to the Fruit
and Nut, a gay bar.

53:35.338 --> 53:40.760
I picked somebody up.

53:41.052 --> 53:44.347
Was he hung?

53:44.639 --> 53:48.726
Not like you.

53:49.018 --> 53:51.437
It was right in the middle
of the parking lot.

53:51.729 --> 53:54.106
We did it in the car.

53:54.398 --> 53:57.235
It was really sexy and all.

53:57.526 --> 53:58.778
Did you do the nasty?

53:59.070 --> 53:59.445
What?

53:59.737 --> 54:02.531
Did he open the back door?

54:02.823 --> 54:05.368
God, no.

54:05.660 --> 54:07.578
Um.

54:07.870 --> 54:09.997
I don't think so.

54:10.289 --> 54:11.916

Rod.

54:17.672 --> 54:18.214
Um.

54:18.506 --> 54:23.302
Afterwards, he wouldn't
even look at me.

54:28.266 --> 54:32.186
Do you think most guys
only care about sex?

54:32.478 --> 54:33.396
Look, I really have to go.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.856
Holy shit, he
gave me a hickey.

54:36.148 --> 54:38.401

gonna notice that.

54:38.693 --> 54:41.112

54:41.404 --> 54:42.405
Wait, wait.

54:42.697 --> 54:45.491

54:45.783 --> 54:48.077

54:48.369 --> 54:51.706
I just want you to know I,

54:51.998 --> 54:57.336
I was only
thinking about you.

54:57.628 --> 55:00.172

Please, don't call me again.

55:54.560 --> 55:56.479

57:35.286 --> 57:37.371

57:37.663 --> 57:41.375

was just being stupid.

57:50.968 --> 57:54.930

I have to tell you.

57:55.222 --> 57:58.934

Promise no matter
what I say,

58:04.899 --> 58:10.154
nothing will change
between us.

58:10.446 --> 58:15.451
Promise.

58:15.743 --> 58:21.624
This is so hard to
finally say out loud.

58:21.916 --> 58:25.544
You can tell
me anything.

58:34.428 --> 58:38.390
I think I like guys.

58:40.518 --> 58:42.978
What?

58:43.270 --> 58:45.523
What do you mean?

58:45.814 --> 58:50.945
I don't know.

58:51.237 --> 58:54.740
I don't know what
the fuck I am.

59:05.834 --> 59:07.670
Mag?

59:07.962 --> 59:11.757
You're scaring me here.

59:12.049 --> 59:15.094
Tell me I'm not a freak.

59:15.386 --> 59:18.889
You're all I have.

59:19.181 --> 59:22.560
Eric, you're my
best friend.

59:22.851 --> 59:25.896
It doesn't
change anything.

59:31.569 --> 59:35.698
Thank you.

59:35.990 --> 59:40.703
It's Rod, right?

59:40.995 --> 59:42.580
You knew.

59:42.871 --> 59:44.873
No.

59:45.165 --> 59:50.504
I don't know.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.048
Is he your boyfriend?

59:57.136 --> 01:00:02.433
He doesn't give a
shit about me.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.730
I really liked him.

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:13.068
He said he liked me.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.615
Did you guys have sex?

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.165
Every time I try
to forget about him,

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:30.210
I can remember
him kissing me.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:33.797
It felt so right.

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:37.259
I'm scared.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:41.764
All I want is to meet
somebody special.

01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:47.144
I want to fall in love.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.815
I need you so bad.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:58.530
Oh.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:19.802
(Mom)
Hello.

01:01:20.094 --> 01:01:22.638
God, you gave me
a heart attack.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.014
You were out all night.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:24.765
I know.

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:27.226
Um, after the party,
Mag and I went to the

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:30.312
Country Kitchen and,
God, it was so busy.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:31.814
You know, we had
to wait.

01:01:32.106 --> 01:01:33.857
A call would
have been nice.

01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:38.028
I know, I know,
I'm sorry.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.698
I was worried.

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:42.032
Just warn me next time.

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:43.409
Okay, yeah.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:47.955
I'm really sorry,
I really am.

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:51.750
It's weird seeing
you in that uniform.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.961
At least the pockets work.
