00:02.586 --> 00:06.881
I think we're all familiar with
the tragic events at Arctic Biosystems...

00:07.049 --> 00:10.134
...and the failure that occurred
under the watch of Hiroshi Hatake.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.889
But from the ashes,
a new opportunity has arisen.

00:15.057 --> 00:18.017
A scientific breakthrough: Narvik-C.

00:20.646 --> 00:25.566
Unlike Dr. Hatake, science doesn't lie,
or make excuses or feel confused.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.071
We can trust the new Narvik.
It's right there in the report.

00:30.239 --> 00:34.325
Which is why I recommend moving
forward with Narvik-C immediately.

00:39.331 --> 00:43.668
We've all made great sacrifices to
prevent humanity from going off-course.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.838
Unfortunately, those sacrifices
have been in vain.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.720
Alan.

00:55.723 --> 00:56.764
Sorry.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.017
It's cool.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.312
You know, we don't have to stop.

01:04.481 --> 01:05.690
Yes, we do.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.569
At this hour?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.280
Come on.

01:14.158 --> 01:17.577
-Board meeting's been rescheduled.
-What? When?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.037
An hour ago.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.708
Why the hell didn't they tell me?

01:24.168 --> 01:27.336
With Narvik-C,
we can finally arrive at our goal...

01:27.504 --> 01:31.841
...of making the planet
a stable, sustainable concern.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.850
Dr. Walker, nice of you to join us.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.438
I would have joined you sooner
if I'd been informed of this meeting.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.231
A scheduling error, I'm sure.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.818
As always, we value
your input in these matters.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.820
As I was saying...

01:52.988 --> 01:56.866
...we at the Ilaria Corporation held out
hope that nature would take care of itself.

01:57.034 --> 02:00.703
But overpopulation, diminishing
resources and drastic climate change...

02:00.871 --> 02:02.330
...have forced our hand.

02:02.498 --> 02:07.168
We must take a more active role
in the stewardship of the human race.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.382
With 17 coordinated strikes...

02:13.550 --> 02:17.470
...we can reduce world population
by 75 percent within three months.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.516
And we'd still have the ability to administer
the cure created by Dr. Walker...

02:21.683 --> 02:23.851
...to any mortals deemed essential.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.938
We expect this to be a short list.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.441
I had assurances Ilaria
would suspend work on the Narvik virus.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.694
You were assured
we would suspend human testing.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.154
Nothing more.

02:35.322 --> 02:39.450
You told me I would have time to research
and develop non-lethal alternatives.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.786
And tell us, what have you delivered?

02:41.954 --> 02:44.747
My crop redistribution initiative
is very promising.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.791
-How long?
-Fifty to a hundred years.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.460
Narvik can accomplish that
in 50 to a hundred days.

02:49.628 --> 02:54.674
Pollution, famine, drought....
They won't wait, Dr. Walker.

02:55.217 --> 02:58.636
-This is about our very survival.
-Call it what you want. It's genocide.

02:58.804 --> 03:03.182
Must we hear this from someone
who's barely lived a single lifetime?

03:03.350 --> 03:07.728
We've been harassed, persecuted
and tortured on seven continents.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.065
You didn't have to see your loved ones
burned at the stake.

03:11.233 --> 03:15.236
This isn't genocide,
it's a cleansing moment of clarity.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.156
Let's put it to a vote. Those in favor?

03:23.745 --> 03:24.787
Opposed?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.417
The motion carries.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.463
Next item: executive compensation.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.263
She collapsed.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.349
I did everything I could.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.518
I tried to help her.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.980
-I tried.
-Of course you did.

03:51.148 --> 03:55.735
I mean, she didn't even have any signs
that she was ill.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.361
It's better this way.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.655
She didn't suffer.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.200
I'm just not ready to let her go.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.578
-She was ready.
-But I wasn't.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.914
I wasn't.
This is not what I wanted.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.126
-It's not how I wanted it to be.
-Michael, listen to me, please.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.503
-She was my mother.
-And my daughter.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.713
I know.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.841
And I should be falling apart right now,
but I'm not.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.968
Do you know why?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.887
Because I'm with you.

04:23.680 --> 04:28.517
And I know you're going to take care
of me and everyone else here.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.813
Because no matter what, you prevail.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.149
You understand?

04:35.317 --> 04:38.527
You prevail.

04:39.821 --> 04:43.407
That is how we prevail.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.958
She's taken her final path.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.296
Yes, she has.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.634
We will prevail.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.845
We will.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.891
Oh, thank you, Anne.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.851
Thank you.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.814
I knew I could count on your strength.

05:16.400 --> 05:21.821
Of all my daughters,
you've always been my favorite.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.959
-Sarah. Thank God.
-Alan?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.712
Where have you been?
I can't get a straight answer.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.798
It's a long story.
Why are you handcuffed?

06:23.633 --> 06:27.053
You should ask your good friend,
Dr. Sommer.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.345
If he is a doctor.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.349
Texas Tech Med School in Lubbock.
That's the Harvard of the Panhandle.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.685
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.688
-Kyle, what the hell is going on?
-You haven't figured it out?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.398
-He's a mole.
-Watch it, friend.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.902
He's undercover.
Apparently, I'm the CDC's most wanted.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.779
And I am not your friend.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.615
You've been investigating us
this entire time?

06:47.783 --> 06:48.824
Not you, him.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.659
This man's a wanted terrorist.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.662
Multiple counts of murder
and the bombing of Ilaria in Paris.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.249
I trust him, which is more
than I can say for you right now.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.210
That's why you're not in charge
of uncuffing people.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.713
I've been watching you. You do not
have the know-how to get out of this.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.841
Then start looking closer
because I'm the guy who's doing it.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.968
-Where's Peter? Does he know?
-He's AWOL.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.930
-Well, we should find him.
-I've tried. No one's seen him.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.266
Maybe he knew something about you
the rest of us didn't.

07:15.685 --> 07:19.939
Last I checked, I was the one who didn't
desert or get himself on a suspect list.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.233
So how about we start
with what I have to say?

07:22.400 --> 07:26.070
I filtered the honey and found pollen
with three sides and distinctive furrows.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.073
-Pollen?
-Yeah. It should lead us to the source.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.367
We just have to take samples
and find a match.

07:31.535 --> 07:35.079
Do you have any idea how many trees
and plants there are on this island?

07:35.247 --> 07:36.330
That could take months.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.291
What's so funny?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.626
M. domestica.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.964
-Of course. How did we not see it?
-What didn't we see?

07:45.132 --> 07:48.342
It was right under your nose all along,
doctor.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.845
Three-sided pollen, distinctive furrows.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.681
That's M. domestica,
otherwise known as the common apple.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.766
Everybody's eating apples.
Why aren't they all sick?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.768
That's what you need to find out.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.605
We need to take apple pollen samples,
and we need to do it now.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.441
And I would be happy to do it,
except that I'm....

08:04.609 --> 08:05.985
You sit tight.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.404
I'm done trusting anybody
with the name Farragut.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.283
I suggest you do the same.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.789
A stroke.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.876
-Is that what he said?
-Yes.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.171
Does our father even know
what a stroke looks like?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.798
Why are you questioning him?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.427
Because you're blind.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.387
Mind your tone with me.

08:33.555 --> 08:37.057
Of course.
I should never question, never doubt.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.644
-Just be Michael's humble servant.
-Yes.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.730
As I am.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.858
-As your grandmother was.
-My grandmother?

08:47.319 --> 08:54.074
You know, I saw her last night on her way
to see Michael. To accuse him.

08:55.827 --> 09:01.415
She didn't tell you?
The girl from the CDC, Sarah?

09:02.584 --> 09:06.795
She has eyes just like him.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.882
All this time,
Michael told us he was the only one.

09:10.050 --> 09:14.887
And the moment Agnes finds another,
she dies?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.430
Of a stroke?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.141
Yes.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.688
And you'd better accept it
before you step out of this room.

09:24.856 --> 09:30.110
-We owe that man everything.
-Maybe we owe him too much.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.071
Maybe it's time for him to pay.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.114
Now, you listen to me.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.533
Your 20th birthday is coming.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.995
-I won't do it.
-You will do your duty.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.249
Like I did, and my mother
and her mother before her.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.417
And on and on.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.462
All those portraits on the wall.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.382
All of them his precious daughters.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.384
All of them his lovers.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.554
-I'm not ashamed of what I am.
-Maybe you should be.

09:57.722 --> 10:02.434
You and Agnes
and every last one of us.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.938
You made me what I am,
but I didn't ask for it.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.691
What you should be is grateful.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.859
This gift honors all of us.

10:11.027 --> 10:16.865
And like me and every one of us,
you will bear Michael a daughter.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.911
-I won't let my father have me.
-You will give me a granddaughter.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.748
The line will remain unbroken.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.757
Good morning, Peter.

10:33.925 --> 10:37.177
It seems your brother's flown the coop.

10:37.345 --> 10:40.597
So why don't you step out
into the light?

10:41.516 --> 10:43.017
Come on now.

10:43.184 --> 10:47.563
Step into the light
and let me see your eyes.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.357
Your real eyes.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.695
You've already seen my eyes.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.697
Yes, well...

10:56.865 --> 11:00.576
...there's so many ways to hide:
dyes, lenses, injections.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.370
-I have no idea what you're talk--
-Oh, come on. Come on.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.331
I'll get answers one way or the other.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
Are you one of them?

11:07.417 --> 11:08.667
Did Ilaria send you?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.627
What's Ilaria?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.338
Nice try.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.132
But the correct response
would have been "Who's Ilaria?"

11:15.300 --> 11:17.384
I work for the CDC. I'm just a scientist.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.886
-Just a scientist.
-Yeah.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.723
So then you should know the function
of a catalyst, yes?

11:22.891 --> 11:28.187
-Of course.
-Well, I'd like to introduce a catalyst...

11:31.483 --> 11:37.488
...to jump-start
your consideration of my questions.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.370
I wouldn't sleep if I were you.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.831
They haven't been fed in a few days.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.309
They call it the Planting Ritual.

12:07.477 --> 12:12.064
He did it to my mother
and my grandmother.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.399
It's barbaric.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.529
He's a great man.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.116
-You should be honored.
-He's my father.

12:22.283 --> 12:26.328
I don't know what you want me to do.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.250
Michael's made us all free.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.254
Oh, you're free?

12:35.755 --> 12:36.880
How nice for you.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.051
I'll think of that
when he's forcing himself on me.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.261
Don't talk like that.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.805
Don't like having to hear
something so unpleasant?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.265
Stop.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.724
Just stop.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.481
Do you know I pray?

12:54.649 --> 12:58.026
Ever since
this horrible disease started...

12:58.194 --> 12:59.695
...I've prayed.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.489
Not that things would get better.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.659
That they would get worse.

13:07.328 --> 13:12.624
That it would get so bad, it would take
away his power and I could run away.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.923
I don't want him to be
the father of my child.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.802
I want it to be someone special.

13:35.273 --> 13:39.485
If only someone would make sure he
couldn't do those horrible things to me.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.625
There is a moment in every life...

13:54.792 --> 13:58.295
...where the body can no longer
follow the path prescribed by the mind.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.009
Agnes has reached
the end of her path...

14:04.177 --> 14:09.640
...and discarded the hollow shell
that we call the body.

14:10.475 --> 14:13.894
But in a time like this,
we must ask ourselves...

14:14.938 --> 14:18.899
...who better, who more deserving...

14:20.485 --> 14:24.488
...to go on so great a journey?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.909
Agnes was the best of us.

14:30.620 --> 14:35.666
A caring soul brimming with love...

14:35.833 --> 14:40.128
...and a gifted scientist
whose miraculous abilities...

14:40.296 --> 14:46.093
...gave us the sweetest
of all of our garden's bounty.

14:48.304 --> 14:54.226
Everything sweet on this island
was made so by Agnes' creation.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.314
The hybrid Chester blackberry...

15:00.316 --> 15:03.986
...that, like the life
she taught us to lead...

15:04.612 --> 15:09.700
...survives the worst conditions.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.832
So let us honor her and partake...

15:19.377 --> 15:22.963
...in the greatest gift she created.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.372
-Get off.
-You're trying to kill me!

16:02.920 --> 16:04.212
I need some help here.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.777
Where'd these new infected
come from?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.196
I don't know.
The screams started 10 minutes ago.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.240
-What do we do?
-Get these people into quarantine.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.992
What if there's not enough room?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.078
Find the biggest room,
round up the sick.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.413
-They won't come willingly.
-Use physical force.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.583
They're having a psychotic break,
they won't listen to reason.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.752
They're not your friends and family
anymore.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.963
Divide into teams of two.
Use ropes, belts, whatever you can find.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.050
We need to restrain these people
before they hurt themselves.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.052
-Now go.
-Quickly, everyone.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.735
That's not the face of someone
who got her way.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.153
That's because I didn't.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.073
-But everything they promised....
-Is now un-promised.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.618
The facilities are operational
in 17 major cities, shipments are moving.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.163
They're making plans to ensure
the nuclear power plants don't melt down.

17:20.331 --> 17:21.915
This is happening.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.710
-So this really is the end of the world.
-Not yet.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.421
It's still a week
before they can pull the trigger.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.050
Sergio?

17:35.179 --> 17:36.888
I'm sorry.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.434
I've seen a lot of death in my time.

17:40.601 --> 17:44.688
Hell, I've caused a fair share of it. But
the scope of what they are planning is....

17:44.856 --> 17:46.982
I'm gonna contact the CDC.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.609
-Blow the whistle.
-Is that our best option?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.446
It's not like the CDC's
been able to contain the virus.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.948
Who knows how long
it'll take them to coordinate.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.034
It's our only option
unless you have a better idea.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.709
You know how Ilaria deals with traitors.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.669
I'm not asking you to be part of this.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.338
Guilt by association.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.716
There are Ilaria safe houses
around the world.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.761
Yeah.
I'm sure I'd be safe in one of those.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.104
What's this?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.607
Little souvenir from Arctic Biosystems.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.695
Best served chilled.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.699
-The cure.
-A single dose.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.659
Keep it safe.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.413
It's about to become
the most valuable substance on Earth.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.961
What happened?
You get the samples?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.964
We got a new outbreak.
At least 30 victims, maybe more.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.759
Anne's putting together teams
to get them into quarantine.

18:55.927 --> 18:58.094
-Thirty victims? How?
-I don't know.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.097
We gotta get this thing under control.
It's a war zone.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.600
Hey, watch it. You'll pop your stitches.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.185
He's right.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.312
-You gotta sit this one out.
-What? No.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.774
You cannot triage an abbey's worth
of unstable patients on your own.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.651
-I'm coming with you.
-For God's sake.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.238
-Take me out of these cuffs so I can help.
-No way.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.490
Where will I go?
We're in the middle of the ocean.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.493
-I got my orders.
-They can recite them at your funeral.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.622
If you don't let me out of these cuffs,
none of us are getting off this island alive.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.127
Let me go!

19:45.101 --> 19:47.269
I need those sedatives.
What's the holdup?

19:47.436 --> 19:50.355
I was explaining we only have
20 injectable doses of diazepam.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.817
-I can't allow you to use it on our people.
-See what I'm dealing with?

19:53.985 --> 19:57.654
We don't see Western medicine
as a positive step to being.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.614
Anne, these people are suffering.

19:59.782 --> 20:03.702
What you call suffering
we see as a difficult but necessary path.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.163
I don't give a damn what kind
of kale smoothies you've been drinking.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.708
People are gonna be
pulling out of their restraints.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.878
No amount of "being" will keep them
from ripping out your throat.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.838
He's right, Anne.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.506
Hello, Jerome.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.052
I'm glad your path brought you here
where you can be of help.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.805
I know where my path
is gonna take me when this is over.

20:23.973 --> 20:29.185
Please. Let's not let unfinished business
get in the way of caring for the sick.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.771
And don't let dogma prevent healing.

20:31.939 --> 20:35.734
It's the CDC's job to make sure
our people get well.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.068
Isn't that right?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.654
The sedatives will provide comfort
for six hours.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.449
-And what do we do after that?
-Sominous?

20:43.326 --> 20:46.578
It's a hybrid of valerian, skullcap
and mother's wort.

20:46.746 --> 20:50.790
Agnes was making it before she left us.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.084
It's an excellent sedative.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.795
It can be administered orally in a tea.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.183
Hello, Olivia.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.686
I brought you something.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.027
I thought everyone
had forgotten about me.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.236
Of course not.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.448
Things have gotten a little crazy.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.117
I heard screaming.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.619
What's going on up there?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.789
There are a lot more sick people now.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.626
The CDC doctors are locking everyone
in the refectory.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.128
Monsters.

21:38.339 --> 21:42.175
I just hope they don't do to them
what they did to my Soren.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.386
Truth is, no one knows
what they're doing.

21:44.553 --> 21:48.640
You may be in the safest place
in the whole Abbey.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.893
They had no right to punish me.

21:52.812 --> 21:58.108
Doesn't Michael say that a true path
is always righteous?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.317
That he does.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.363
Then I'm glad I stabbed
that CDC woman.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.533
I'd do it again.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.451
Please, Olivia.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.162
-Don't say that.
-I mean it.

22:12.373 --> 22:16.334
No one was sick until they got here.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.545
And now Soren's gone.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.714
They killed my son.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.924
Who's gonna be punished for that?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.467
I don't know.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.430
I just wish someone
would make them go away.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.609
This Valerian skullcap stuff,
it's gonna work, right?

23:22.777 --> 23:26.112
-My mother was a brilliant chemist.
-That's not what I asked.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.657
I need to know we're not gonna
have a slaughterhouse on our hands.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.493
It will work.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.412
How did 83 people get sick
at the same time?

23:34.580 --> 23:37.499
They were all exposed
to the pathogen simultaneously.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.085
So, what was the axis event?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.669
Breakfast?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.755
This is the same diet as every day?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.507
Nothing was added to the menu.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.509
Were all these people together
somewhere?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.053
Maybe the orchard
or the counsel hall?

23:50.221 --> 23:52.806
We were all at the memorial service
for Agnes.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.141
We all ate the berries,
the hybrid she created.

23:55.309 --> 23:58.311
-All of these people?
-We all ate them, even me.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.730
If you were gonna be sick,
you'd be sick already.

24:00.898 --> 24:04.317
Still, eating those berries is the only thing
the infected have in common.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.820
That's where we start.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.654
It's the black hole.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.322
No light can escape.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.991
Listen.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.452
I know you're in pain, but I can help.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.497
-I'm a doctor.
-Pain is fleeting.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.332
It goes in the hole.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.792
Understand?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.879
Once it's in there, it never escapes.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.256
-I understand.
-Never. Never.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.926
I understand. Please.
Please. Just get me out of here.

25:12.094 --> 25:15.638
The things they want gone
go in the hole.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.599
In the hole.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.975
Look, hey. Listen, listen.

25:19.143 --> 25:25.106
Just you pull up the grate
and I'll do the rest, okay?

25:27.651 --> 25:29.611
-Pain stays in the hole.
-No, no, no.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.738
-It can't escape.
-No, no, no.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.824
-No, no, no.
-Pain goes in the hole.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.953
Pain goes in the hole!

26:44.061 --> 26:45.520
Here's the next batch.

26:46.897 --> 26:49.649
Say, Sarah, you wouldn't happen
to have some gum, would you?

26:49.817 --> 26:53.111
Oh, so now I'm "Sarah"
now that you need something from me?

26:53.279 --> 26:55.321
Didn't think we'd be here this long.
I'm out.

26:55.489 --> 26:59.117
You do know too much xylitol can
increase your blood sugar levels, right?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.618
Thanks.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.788
I'll remember that when I go
for my Ph.D. in gum-ology.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.711
I've got something.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.214
It's definitely a fungus.

27:14.425 --> 27:17.677
It looks like the same one we found
in Soren's blood.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.013
Is it in all the samples?

27:20.180 --> 27:24.851
No. Only in wells 3 through 9,
15 through 21, and 43 through 48.

27:25.019 --> 27:26.853
And those all came
from the same batch.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.022
Only some of the berries
are contaminated.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.150
-Well, that rules out accidental exposure.
-What are you saying?

27:32.318 --> 27:35.486
-Think somebody did this on purpose?
-It's the only explanation.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.365
Half the bowls were spiked,
probably with contaminated honey.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.618
The only question is, who had access?

27:46.623 --> 27:47.790
Hello, Peter.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.584
Are you ready to talk?

27:50.294 --> 27:51.669
There's been a new outbreak.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.589
And I know you'd like
to help your friends.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.716
They're struggling without their leader.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.968
Then let me out so I can help them.

27:59.136 --> 28:00.219
In good time.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.139
Provided you help me.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.974
And how do I do that?

28:05.142 --> 28:07.894
Your friend, Sarah, she's very special.

28:08.062 --> 28:11.522
And please don't pretend
that you don't know about her or me.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.902
But I'd like you to tell me
how she got to be that way.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.279
I don't know.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.406
I wasn't there when it happened.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.033
Oh, I get it.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.118
You liked those rats.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.579
You wanna see how many more
I can fit down there.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.916
I mean, I was sick, out of my mind.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.334
I wasn't a part of it.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.798
Well, maybe you just need a little
more time to think about your answers.

28:37.674 --> 28:42.428
I'll be back, say, in a year or two.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.930
No, no. Wait, wait.

28:45.182 --> 28:47.558
I know the people
who made her immortal.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.187
If you let me out,
I can get the information.

28:51.814 --> 28:54.232
If you give me something I can use...

28:54.400 --> 28:57.026
...I will contemplate your release.

28:57.194 --> 29:01.030
I don't know what made Sarah immortal,
but I know about her baby.

29:01.198 --> 29:03.241
It's immortal too.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.786
At least she thinks it is.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.830
Her....

29:10.374 --> 29:11.749
Her baby?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.210
She has an immortal child?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.546
She was pregnant
when she became immortal.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.464
You're sure about this?

29:18.632 --> 29:20.758
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.265
Thank you, Peter.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.309
I think we're going to be great friends.

29:32.479 --> 29:33.938
Hey, then let me out of here.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.190
-Please invite Dr. Jordan to my office.
-Hey!

29:36.358 --> 29:37.525
And bring the restraints.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.652
Hey, let me out of here!

29:40.195 --> 29:43.197
Hey! Come on!

29:43.365 --> 29:45.324
Michael!

29:45.492 --> 29:46.826
Michael!

29:56.670 --> 29:59.338
An immortal child?

30:01.091 --> 30:02.967
Not just that.

30:03.135 --> 30:07.555
The child might be the way
to make the rest of us like Michael.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.224
Are you sure that's all he said?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.269
Isn't that enough?

30:15.314 --> 30:20.776
Enough to make you bring Dr. Jordan
to me instead of him.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.154
But....

30:23.572 --> 30:24.614
Michael told me--

30:24.781 --> 30:27.742
I know what he told you,
but don't you understand?

30:27.910 --> 30:31.996
The moment I was born without the eyes,
I've been good for only one thing.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.082
To bear him another daughter.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.836
And he'll keep doing it
to every one of his daughters.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.047
Do you know why?

30:41.798 --> 30:45.134
Because every time he does,
the mortal part gets weaker...

30:45.302 --> 30:47.845
...and the immortal part gets stronger.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.223
That's why it has to be his daughters.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.726
He thinks one day he'll have a child
like himself.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.728
Don't.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.648
-Damn it, Amy.
-What did you just say?

30:59.233 --> 31:00.816
You heard me.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.736
I've done a lot of things, bad things.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.279
I've done them for you.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.240
And you've received nothing in return?

31:07.407 --> 31:08.574
I didn't say that.

31:08.742 --> 31:12.578
But Michael has Anne asking questions
about how people got sick.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.288
She won't find out.

31:14.456 --> 31:17.083
She's not just gonna let you do
whatever you want.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.003
-If I get caught--
-You think I would let you suffer?

31:23.507 --> 31:24.840
Little you think of me.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.844
Of us.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.973
You keep telling me there is no "us."

31:35.018 --> 31:38.688
There's either you and me
or you and Michael.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.190
You can't have both.

31:41.733 --> 31:47.446
When you make a decision,
that's when you'll know if there is an "us."

32:13.807 --> 32:15.558
Hello?

32:16.476 --> 32:18.269
Is someone there?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.029
I guess I don't have to ask
how you got in.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.115
We do own the place.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.577
Please, sit.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.246
-I don't have time for games.
-More's the pity.

32:37.414 --> 32:41.500
I've spent the balance of a hundred years
learning to make the perfect coq au vin.

32:42.294 --> 32:47.673
Turns out the secret is in skimming
the impurities from the sauce.

32:48.508 --> 32:51.344
Much like what Ilaria
is trying to accomplish.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.722
Why are you here?

32:55.223 --> 32:57.350
Why is any of us here?

32:58.143 --> 33:01.771
You ask that a lot when you spend so
much time around people with agendas.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.940
Like our colleagues at Ilaria.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.610
You still haven't answered
my question.

33:08.195 --> 33:12.657
Your plan to inform the CDC will fail.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.286
-Balleseros told you?
-Oh, please.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.915
I heard your protests, I saw the files
you pulled from the data banks.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.667
The rest was arithmetic.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.543
Don't beat yourself up.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.671
We've been doing this
a very long time.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.636
What is that?

33:33.804 --> 33:36.305
Our last chance.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.101
Turns out I don't relish the idea
of spending eternity...

33:40.268 --> 33:43.771
...in the company of the same silver-eyed
dullards any more than you do.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.318
No more than I like the idea
of exterminating humanity.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.489
And I'm not the only one
who feels that way.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.241
"Mademoiselle Durant"?

33:55.409 --> 33:59.995
She'll be at the Jardin De La Jeune Lune
tomorrow at 9 sharp.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.164
Don't be late.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.254
I do hope you're not vegan.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.639
Oh, damn, that is good.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.936
Everyone, please stay. Please.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.313
I'd like you all to see this.

34:27.691 --> 34:28.733
Is something wrong?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.986
Well, I don't know, Amy.
Is something wrong?

34:34.740 --> 34:35.990
I'd like to know.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.369
Is there anything you need
to say to me?

34:41.663 --> 34:42.830
No.

34:43.915 --> 34:44.957
What's wrong?

34:45.125 --> 34:46.459
You're scaring us.

34:46.626 --> 34:50.713
Landry, would you be so kind
as to search that locker, please?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.810
-Whose coat is this?
-It's mine.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.738
Oh, Anne.

35:15.906 --> 35:16.989
How could you?

35:17.157 --> 35:19.575
I have no idea how that got there.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.744
Of course you don't.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.121
Bring her.

35:24.289 --> 35:25.998
Look, this is ridiculous.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.167
Step aside.

35:32.172 --> 35:35.132
There's no way she brought that
into this Abbey.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.176
Oh, you mean the source
of the disease?

35:37.344 --> 35:39.386
The reason why we're all cowering
in fear?

35:39.554 --> 35:41.680
You made them all sick.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.265
No. Why would I?

35:43.433 --> 35:44.809
I don't know.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.101
But I'm gonna find out.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.148
No, Michael.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.399
I'd never do that.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.443
I'd never do that.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.363
Please, Michael.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.225
Mademoiselle Durant?

36:29.479 --> 36:32.064
After 500 years? Really?

36:44.870 --> 36:46.954
That was very rude of her.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.414
I'm sorry?

36:48.582 --> 36:50.082
No need to be sorry.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.263
Madame Walker, I presume?

37:04.431 --> 37:05.973
I am Mademoiselle Durant.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.978
I never could get used
to the contact lenses.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.939
Don't be so surprised.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.358
You know we come in all sizes.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.572
I hear you met that little shit
who calls himself "The Scythe."

37:22.073 --> 37:23.198
I did.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.994
It's because of people like him
that there are people like me...

37:27.162 --> 37:28.704
...and Madame Wallenberg.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.789
What kind of people are you?

37:30.957 --> 37:35.252
The kind who know damn well you
cannot change the system from within.

37:36.004 --> 37:40.674
A young person's mistake,
but there's hope for you yet.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.260
I need more than hope right now.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.137
We need you too.

37:45.305 --> 37:48.015
There is another renegade immortal.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.725
Not one of us.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.437
But he's been working
on something very promising.

37:53.605 --> 37:57.858
A project that might prevent our friends
at Ilaria from ending the human race.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.819
-Well, tell me.
-There is much for you to learn.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.656
And it begins here.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.218
Cut the bonds
and get them out of those beds.

38:24.386 --> 38:26.804
We need to save
our brothers and sisters.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.266
Hey. Hey, what are you people doing?

38:31.434 --> 38:33.102
You gotta put them back in the beds.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.313
Hey, when these people come to,
they're gonna be violent.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.983
-Don't you understand?
-Olivia? What is happening here?

38:39.150 --> 38:41.860
What does it look like?
We're taking care of our own.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.114
Olivia, you know me.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.448
I've lived here.

38:46.616 --> 38:49.284
You lived among us,
but you were never one of us.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.453
But you have to let us help
these people.

38:51.621 --> 38:54.373
I took your help, and I lost my son.

38:54.541 --> 38:58.752
Now is our time to show
these sowers of disease and discord...

38:58.920 --> 39:00.587
...that they can't bully us.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.839
We stand together.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.716
-Let's go.
-Together. Come on.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.426
Let's go.

39:06.594 --> 39:09.263
-We're not gonna win this one.
-We let them take the sick?

39:09.431 --> 39:11.557
For now. I've seen this before.

39:11.725 --> 39:15.936
Frightened people blaming their doctors
for their disease, hurting, even killing.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.606
Get to the lab, protect Sarah.
Go. Now, now.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.568
I don't know what's taking Alan so long.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.236
He knows what he's doing.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.364
I hope so.
Those people were ready to kill.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.784
They'd have turned on us in a moment,
no problem.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.746
That's ironic, coming from you.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.791
Hey, I'm just doing a job. Like you.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.292
Not exactly like me.

40:23.588 --> 40:26.965
-This doesn't make any sense.
-What doesn't?

40:27.133 --> 40:29.051
No. Something must be wrong
with the spec.

40:29.219 --> 40:32.805
Seeing as it probably shares a birthday
with my daddy.... What's it saying?

40:32.972 --> 40:36.725
The apple pollen samples you gathered
tested positive for the fungus.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.019
Great. Now we know
how the honey got infected.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.648
Except there are no traces of mycotoxin
in the apples, only in the honey.

40:43.608 --> 40:49.029
So the honey makes you Mycotic
and kills you, but the apples don't?

40:52.408 --> 40:55.160
-Kyle. Sarah.
-Alan, great. We need fresh eyes on this.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.370
Come here.

40:56.538 --> 40:59.581
Kyle, we're conducting a room-by-room
search for the Mycotics.

40:59.749 --> 41:00.833
We could use your help.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.168
You calling the shots now?

41:03.336 --> 41:05.087
Just conveying information.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.215
All right, all right. I'm coming.
