00:10.802 --> 00:13.388
Guys, I can't find my phone!

00:14.180 --> 00:15.432
Oh, not again.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.226
All right, Claire lost her phone.
I'll check the fridge.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.894
Claire, cabinets. Jayden, bathroom.

00:19.978 --> 00:23.732
Grant, cushions, in between, underneath
and most importantly, right on top.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.985
Let's go, people, the first 48 seconds
are the most important!

00:27.068 --> 00:29.738
Hey, Solana, I found your tarot cards.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.615
My tarot cards! Oh, thank Vishnu.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.369
-Bathroom's clear.
-Guys, found a phone.

00:36.953 --> 00:40.707
Wait, that's my old phone.
Oh, it still has 4%.

00:40.790 --> 00:44.044
-Aww. Look at all of our old pictures.
-Look at us at the beach!

00:44.127 --> 00:47.338
And look, that cooler with the cup holders
on it. Where is that thing?

00:47.422 --> 00:48.840
I thought you had it.

00:50.216 --> 00:54.304
Okay, people, we've got a missing cooler,
wheels on the back, so this thing moves.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.473
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:03.188 --> 01:05.815
Yep. Claire, your phone's in your purse!

01:17.077 --> 01:20.205
The way the tarot cards work is
I will lay down a card,

01:20.288 --> 01:22.665
and that card reveals
what the universe has in store.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.876
-You're gonna tell us our future?
-In a sense.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.294
In a nonsense.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.423
Don't listen to her. The cards have power.

01:30.507 --> 01:33.134
I'll pick one for myself so you can see.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.388
Oh. The Temperance card.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.725
That means there's patience,
peace, and calm in my future.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.352
-I want a reading.
-Oh. Me too.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.729
-Do us together.
-Together.

01:46.689 --> 01:50.151
Claire and Jayden, ah,
you got the Two of Cups.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.070
Unified love and partnership.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.365
-Jaydie, we're Two of Cups.
-Yeah.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.867
Two gorgeous cups, sitting in a cabinet

01:57.951 --> 02:00.745
waiting to be filled up
with limoncello spritz.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.623
-I have to pee.
-I'm coming with you.

02:03.706 --> 02:04.833
Duh.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.377
Did Claire follow Jayden
into the bathroom?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.711
Two of Cups.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.798
If you just accept the cards as truth,
you'll stop being confused.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.716
-I'm not confused.
-You seem confused.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.803
-There's nothing confusing happening.
-For you there is.

02:19.264 --> 02:24.269
Tarot cards are unproven and fake
and get people worked up over nothing!

02:26.062 --> 02:26.896
Sorry.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.821
It's a shame you think it's fake
because you got the Lovers card.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.699
There's a soulmate in your future.

02:37.782 --> 02:41.703
Congratulations. Any guy would be lucky
to be with you, Chels.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.788
Oh, thanks, Grant.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.542
But judging by my current situation,
the only love in my future

02:47.625 --> 02:50.295
is between me and my weighted blanket.

02:50.378 --> 02:54.299
I call him Lennie because he does
not know his own strength.

02:56.968 --> 02:58.011
Okay.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.722
-Do me next.
-Okay.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.437
-The Tower card.
-Oh, hell yeah!

03:08.646 --> 03:11.149
I wonder which tower I'm gonna go to.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.317
There are so many.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.445
There's the Eiffel Tower,
the Leaning Tower,

03:15.528 --> 03:18.364
and the power tower
where I do my pull-ups.

03:18.448 --> 03:23.494
No, Grant, the Tower card represents
disaster, upheaval, and danger.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.454
Danger?

03:25.580 --> 03:26.414
Me?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.083
On a leg day?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.384
Okay, for the Laura Dern Drag Night,

03:38.468 --> 03:41.429
I was thinking about going
as Jurassic Park Laura Dern,

03:41.512 --> 03:43.223
but it's just so frumpy.

03:43.806 --> 03:46.184
What do you think
about Wild at Heart Laura Dern?

03:46.267 --> 03:50.772
Oh, the polka dot dress, the '90s hair
whipping around in a convertible.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.774
That and still Laura is the girl

03:52.857 --> 03:55.360
that you could call at 2 a.m.
just to talk.

03:56.819 --> 04:00.031
-Oh, hey, babe, how was work?
-Crazy.

04:00.114 --> 04:04.077
I spilled 11 soups.
I wasn't counting, but Howard was.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.788
-Hi, girl!
-Hi!

04:07.538 --> 04:11.918
The last time I saw you,
you were about to keep a stray squirrel.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.004
-Did that end up happening?
-No. He wouldn't get in my car.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.840
But that's okay
because I see him everywhere.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.384
What's up with you guys?

04:19.467 --> 04:21.427
We're talking about this party.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.805
Yeah, it's Laura Dern themed,
so we're all going

04:23.888 --> 04:27.016
dressed up as Laura Dern from her roles,
and get this.

04:27.100 --> 04:31.229
-It's called Derning Down the House.
-Oh, so, fun!

04:31.312 --> 04:32.730
Wait, why Laura Dern?

04:32.814 --> 04:35.400
Oh, she's one of the top five queer icons.

04:35.483 --> 04:39.696
Yeah, it goes, Laura Dern,
Janet Jackson, Judge Judy, Liza,

04:39.779 --> 04:42.824
'cause if not, the gay elders would panic,
and E.T. in a wig.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.619
Oh. But why is she an icon?

04:46.703 --> 04:51.541
She played Ellen DeGeneres' girlfriend,
and then, got blacklisted for years.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.503
And she was in Big Little Lies,
which is our NBA All-Star game.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.172
-Oh...

04:58.256 --> 05:02.302
Oh, my God. You should come with us.
She should come, shouldn't she?

05:02.385 --> 05:05.013
Yes! I mean, totally.

05:05.638 --> 05:09.517
Maybe. Yeah, I just-- I don't even think
it's gonna be that fun.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.477
I'd hate for you to be bored.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.731
I could never be bored with you, Jaydie.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.151
Unless you don't want me to come.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.489
-Of course I want you to come!
-Yay.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.408
Oh, so fun.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.409
Ooh.

05:29.245 --> 05:30.413
Why would you invite her?

05:30.496 --> 05:33.333
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were best friends.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.377
Oh, yes, she is my absolute bestie,

05:36.461 --> 05:39.714
and we're together all the time,
and it's great, but...

05:40.673 --> 05:41.758
I don't know.

05:41.841 --> 05:46.012
I also need our nights out
with our gay gaggle gabbing in gay garb.

05:47.221 --> 05:50.933
You live in a house that's basically
queer Xanadu, but I don't.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.353
You saw how I had to explain
the Laura Dern thing.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.814
I just don't want to be
Claire's tour guide in gay Narnia.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.693
JK, just Narnia. The whole thing
takes place inside of a closet.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.780
I get it!

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
You need boundaries. It makes sense.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.868
Just tell her,
and I'm sure she'll understand.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.828
Oh, no, I can't.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.457
It would hurt her too much. It's fine.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.252
Claire has a super short attention span.
She probably forgot about it already.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.587
Check it out!

06:19.670 --> 06:22.256
I'm going as Wild At Heart Laura Dern!

06:23.091 --> 06:24.008
Oh, great!

06:27.428 --> 06:30.264
Hey, how's it going over here?

06:31.849 --> 06:35.853
-You okay? You look a little freaked out.
-I am. It's the Tower card.

06:35.937 --> 06:39.023
I stubbed my toe on the bench press
and got a paper cut on my tongue.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.942
Were you licking an envelope?

06:41.025 --> 06:43.277
That's the thing. No.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.699
-Did you hear that?
-Yes. It's the sound of the gym.

06:48.783 --> 06:52.245
It's clanging weights
and a playlist called Ibiza 2018.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.039
I'm in danger, Chelsea. Serious danger.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.584
You're fine. All that tarot card
stuff is complete hogwash.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.088
Sorry, I'm reading Dickens.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.049
I don't know. It could be real.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.385
The universe works in mysterious ways.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.471
Hey, guys. Peaceful day, isn't it?

07:11.055 --> 07:11.889
No.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.644
You freaked Grant out
with your tarot card stuff.

07:16.727 --> 07:20.231
Now he jumps every time Buff Billy does
a deadlift, which is all day.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.026
God, that guy's ass is big.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.405
Will you please tell Grant
he's not in danger?

07:27.488 --> 07:29.157
I can't do that.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.202
The tarot cards have spoken, and they've
proven to be right time and time again.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.998
For example, look at me
after receiving the Temperance card.

07:37.582 --> 07:41.502
Yeah. Nothing says temperance
like a fluorescent orange sports bra.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.673
That card has brought me
patience and calm.

07:45.756 --> 07:49.677
Even though you question my beliefs,
I remain completely at ease.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.888
Wow. You're right.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.433
Solana used to get this eye twitch
whenever you disagreed with her, and now

07:56.142 --> 07:56.976
nothing!

07:57.059 --> 08:01.272
Solana, it's not that the cards are real.
It's that you want them to be.

08:01.355 --> 08:05.568
And yet I find myself taking
a full day of yoga classes.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.153
How do you explain that?

08:07.862 --> 08:10.114
You don't find yourself
taking a yoga class,

08:10.198 --> 08:14.118
just like you don't find yourself putting
that top on five straps at a time.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.996
You're obsessed with my top today.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.124
It all makes so much sense.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.378
Grant, no, it doesn't. I promise,
you're not in danger of being hurt.

08:24.462 --> 08:28.007
-Chelsea does have a point.
-Finally. Thank you, Solana.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.092
Danger is all around you.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.761
-What?
-Oh, my God!

08:31.844 --> 08:35.681
The card can take on many shapes.
Maybe danger is coming your way.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.185
Maybe you have to prepare for danger
coming to someone close to you.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.939
Anyway, off to my yoga. Namaste.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.361
Did you hear that?
Everyone around me is in danger.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.948
Stop deadlifting, Buff Billy!
Your ass isn't safe here!

09:00.831 --> 09:03.251
These drinks are wild!

09:03.334 --> 09:06.796
Iced Teabag, Mai Tai Me Up,
A Cock-in-Tail!

09:06.879 --> 09:09.257
I love how gay bars just go there.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.509
Why don't we have names like this
at Franklin's?

09:11.592 --> 09:14.845
I don't think a straight bar would
appreciate the gay sex puns, Claire.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.849
These are gay sex puns?

09:19.433 --> 09:24.063
Oh. Okay, I'm gonna get a white wine. Mm.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.773
I wonder what that's about.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.402
-She's so fun!
-Love.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.946
-Yeah.
-Jay, what's wrong?

09:32.655 --> 09:37.451
Oh, I don't know. It's just Claire is
just, like, super here.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.370
And I gotta explain stuff.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.997
I told you to talk to her.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.999
I know. It's not Claire's fault.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.460
I'm just gonna, as the straights
would say, roll with it.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.631
Jayden, look at that guy.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.091
How is he so hairless?

09:52.174 --> 09:56.178
Part genetics, part lasers, sweetie.
Just keep walking.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.435
Dillon, Jayden, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you guys are friends!

10:02.518 --> 10:03.894
Why are you fighting?

10:03.978 --> 10:06.731
Oh, Claire, we're not fighting.

10:06.814 --> 10:10.318
We were just getting excited about
how fierce Lady Gaga will be in her 80s.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.035
Jayden, what's going on?

10:19.118 --> 10:21.537
Should we go? The cops are here.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.999
And they've already arrested someone!

10:26.125 --> 10:28.711
It's fine, Claire, he's a sub.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.922
I don't care if he's a part-time teacher.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.015
Sorry, Gladys, it's too dangerous
to work your lats. today.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.811
I'd walk you to your car,
but I have others to protect.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.066
Grant, your concern for your clients
is very sweet,

10:50.149 --> 10:52.276
but that's the third session
you've canceled.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.529
Danger surrounds me.
I can't take any chances.

10:56.030 --> 10:59.450
What if something happened to you?
I couldn't live with myself.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.453
Oh. Hmm. Yeah.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.249
Hi. Do you guys have an icepack
I could use for my knee?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.460
-Yeah.
-Oh, no, your knee is hurting?

11:10.336 --> 11:11.462
It's all my fault.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.049
What? No. This is an injury
I've had since I was a kid.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.550
-There you go.
-Thanks.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.887
But you did cancel our session,
which I booked to rehab my knee.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.391
So I'm responsible for hurting your knee!

11:24.183 --> 11:25.434
See? It's happening.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.144
Grant, stop, okay?

11:27.728 --> 11:30.356
What if I proved
that this tarot card stuff isn't real?

11:30.439 --> 11:31.941
Then will you calm down?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.109
I guess.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.445
Okay, all right,
so I got the Lovers card, right?

11:36.529 --> 11:41.033
Which means I will miraculously find love
today, which of course, I won't.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.077
So here, watch this. Um...

11:44.954 --> 11:47.289
Hey! Hey, you in the blue shorts.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.209
Hi. Do you want to go out with me?

11:51.127 --> 11:51.961
Yeah.

11:52.753 --> 11:56.424
-The Lovers card! It worked!
-Oh, okay, hang on, hang on.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.842
Um...

11:57.925 --> 12:01.178
Are you sure?
Because, you know, you don't even know me.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.766
I happen to have a vicious rash on my...

12:08.644 --> 12:10.604
I have a genital rash too.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.523
What are the odds?

12:12.606 --> 12:16.902
-It's a perfect match!
-No, I don't actually have a genital rash.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.488
That proves it. I'm canceling all classes.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.450
I'm happy for you two,
but this place is a death box.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.788
So? What are we thinking?

12:27.872 --> 12:30.249
I rub ointment on you.
You rub ointment on me

12:30.332 --> 12:31.459
-and--

12:34.253 --> 12:35.087
No.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.138
-Jayden!

12:44.805 --> 12:48.350
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Look what I got us.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.771
These are Red Headed Bottoms.
Which refers to...

12:51.854 --> 12:54.857
Butts, Claire.
Just assume it's always butts.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.777
Are you okay? You seem off.

12:59.111 --> 12:59.945
It's just...

13:00.946 --> 13:01.864
I--

13:03.866 --> 13:07.077
Oh, no, it's just these shorts have
sapped me, emotionally.

13:08.829 --> 13:12.917
Well, I have something that will cheer
you up. I signed you up for the contest.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.544
The Greatest Moments
of Dern-story contest?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.589
-Yeah.
-I forgot to sign up. Thanks, Claire.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.008
-Oh, no probs, Jaydie.
-All contestants,

13:21.091 --> 13:25.221
come up to the stage
for The Greatest Moments in Dern-story!

13:25.304 --> 13:26.347
That's our cue.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.933
-Our?
-Yeah.

13:29.016 --> 13:33.771
I signed us up together, as a team.
The Two of Cups.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.443
Where's Grant?

13:42.196 --> 13:44.532
Oh, no. Are you injured?
Where does it hurt?

13:45.533 --> 13:48.869
-Why did you cancel all the yoga classes?
-Because of the Tower card.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.371
Yoga is too dangerous.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.498
What if somebody falls asleep
during savasana

13:52.581 --> 13:54.542
and sleepwalks into the big fan and dies?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.377
-That's not gonna--
-Someone else wakes up.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.586
They see guts everywhere.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.755
They have a weak heart,
so they go into cardiac arrest!

13:59.839 --> 14:03.592
Grant, I needed that yoga class
to stay calm.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.304
Without it, I'll get angry,
which will make me even less calm,

14:07.388 --> 14:11.350
which will make me even angrier,
which will make me very angry.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.019
Solana, you are clearly all riled up.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.189
Why don't you just admit it?
The cards aren't real.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.569
-Those cards are real.
-Hmm.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.654
That twitch in your eye's
telling a different story.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.241
-You...
-What?

14:27.825 --> 14:28.701
You!

14:28.784 --> 14:29.618
Hmm?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.873
-Hmm. Namaste!

14:35.624 --> 14:36.458
You see?

14:40.254 --> 14:44.925
I will not not be rich!

14:48.262 --> 14:50.347
Up next for the moment-off,

14:50.431 --> 14:54.727
Claire and Jayden doing a scene
from Jurassic Park!

14:55.227 --> 14:58.647
Remember, you're
a sick dinosaur on the brink of death.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.317
So just lay there. Yeah?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.278
-Yes!

15:09.575 --> 15:11.410
Is this West Indian Lilac?

15:13.329 --> 15:17.875
There's only one way to be positive.
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.960
Roar! That's my poop!

15:21.378 --> 15:23.547
What are you doing?
You don't have any lines.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.175
Roar! I'm protecting my poop.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.761
I'm hungry! Bring me a goat!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.271
Oh. Wait.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.606
Jayden!

15:40.689 --> 15:41.857
Oh, wait!

15:41.941 --> 15:42.858
Jayden!

15:43.651 --> 15:46.070
Was that last part from Blue Velvet?

15:49.365 --> 15:52.952
I can't believe how scared I got
over those silly tarot cards.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.872
I'm sure your clients will forgive
you, except for Gladys.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.334
But she lives on holding grudges
and Lipitor.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.756
I guess your Lovers card
wasn't real either. I'm sorry.

16:05.839 --> 16:10.511
Yes, alas, love is, as they say,
not in the cards.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.522
Chelsea!

16:22.481 --> 16:24.441
Are you choking?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.110
Chelsea, Chelsea!

16:34.952 --> 16:36.078
Are you okay?

16:39.623 --> 16:42.960
What just happened?
I couldn't breathe.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.547
Grant, you saved my life.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.342
-I'm so glad I was here. You could have--
-I know.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.094
Wow.

16:52.803 --> 16:53.846
The tarot cards.

16:55.014 --> 16:55.973
They're real.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.398
Jayden, can we talk?

17:06.608 --> 17:08.652
Jayden, will you please let me in?

17:10.446 --> 17:12.823
-Fine.
-Jayden, I'm so sorry about the dinosaur.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.867
I know I wasn't supposed to say anything.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.578
And then I ruined the whole night,
and it's all my fault!

17:17.661 --> 17:19.997
-And I'm so, so--
-Claire, stop, please.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.499
It's not about you.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.377
Well, it feels like it is.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.632
Feels like you don't want me here at all.
What's going on?

17:33.052 --> 17:33.886
Okay.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.475
-You know when you go to the bank?
-No. I do all my banking on my phone.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.770
Just pretend you go to the bank.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.021
Okay. Okay.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.568
-I think I see a robber.
-Oh, no, no.

17:49.651 --> 17:54.406
He's not a robber. He's just
a straight guy in a stupid beanie.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.619
And everyone else in the bank
is straight too,

17:59.119 --> 18:02.164
except me, and maybe the twink
behind the counter.

18:02.247 --> 18:06.293
But forget about him. He's gotten so high
and mighty since he bleached his hair.

18:08.003 --> 18:12.174
The point is, the bank is,
by default, a straight space.

18:13.133 --> 18:18.263
And the world is full of straight spaces.
Doctors' offices, gas stations.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.350
H and R Blocks.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.813
Explaining why I spend so much on iced
coffee to my accountant is so annoying.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.190
-But Lou is so good.
-He's the best.

18:28.899 --> 18:32.152
But still, it's a lot.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.950
Being gay in a straight world
can be exhausting.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.203
So having spots like this,

18:41.787 --> 18:43.413
it's so important to me.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.250
A place where I don't feel like...

18:49.002 --> 18:50.796
a stranger in a straight land.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.843
Does that make sense?

18:56.927 --> 18:59.304
Yes. Totally.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.099
Jaydie, I'm so sorry.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.936
You shouldn't have to explain
these things to me,

19:07.020 --> 19:08.730
but I'm really glad you did.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.443
-I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
-Oh, that's okay.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.613
I know when I get upset,
I can be kind of a...

19:16.697 --> 19:18.365
-hurt puppy dog.
-Hurt puppy dog.

19:21.285 --> 19:25.080
I would rather be a hurt puppy dog
than lose your friendship.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.173
The fact that you love me
for who I am means so much to me.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.010
And I'm not saying you're never allowed
to go to gay bars

19:38.093 --> 19:40.929
or come to the Pride Parade
so you can take pictures of me

19:41.013 --> 19:42.890
looking incredible on a float.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.226
I mean, your cheekbones
highlight themselves.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.899
It's gay icon, E.T in a wig!

19:52.482 --> 19:55.485
Yeah, I got my calendar mixed up.
Wrong theme night.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.159
Hey.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.288
-What are you up to?
-Just re-energizing my crystals.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.582
Full moon tonight,
so they should charge quickly.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.043
Right.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.879
So, Solana. Um...

20:15.214 --> 20:19.259
-About these tarot cards...
-Chelsea, I don't wanna argue right now.

20:19.343 --> 20:24.848
I don't have the energy,
and neither do my crystals... yet.

20:27.309 --> 20:32.856
No, I was just wondering,
have there been any studies done?

20:34.107 --> 20:38.195
You know, like double-blinds,
to speak to the actual efficacy.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.824
I'm sensing a different tone here.
Did something happen?

20:43.325 --> 20:46.578
Something involving... love?

20:49.373 --> 20:52.292
No. No, nothing happened. Um...

20:55.087 --> 20:57.297
Maybe a little something happened.

20:59.299 --> 21:03.553
Something a little difficult
to otherwise explain. Um...

21:06.765 --> 21:09.101
Honestly, those tarot cards
aren't real, right?

21:10.185 --> 21:12.980
Maybe the question is not
if the cards are real,

21:13.063 --> 21:14.690
but if you want them to be.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.449
Yeah.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.830
I think maybe I do.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.692
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.281
Do you have a second?
There's something I wanna tell you.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.200
I actually wanted to talk to you too.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.953
-You did?
-Yeah.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.622
Come on in.
