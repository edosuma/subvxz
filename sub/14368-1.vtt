DARREN:
Really think so, Lexi?

01:55.281 --> 01:56.533
{\an1}Surprise!

01:56.616 --> 01:59.244
Can you believe the amount
of homework that Cilia gave?

01:59.327 --> 02:01.663
Is this excruciating or what?

02:01.746 --> 02:04.874
{\an1}Hey, Ginger, if you took
a minute to notice me,

02:04.958 --> 02:07.544
{\an1}you might actually
notice me, okay?

02:07.627 --> 02:09.044
What's that
supposed...

02:09.127 --> 02:10.003
Darren...

02:10.088 --> 02:12.507
You're hot!

02:12.590 --> 02:14.759
Well, I don't know about hot.

02:14.843 --> 02:15.593
Maybe lukewarm.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.512
It's not that
you weren't,

02:17.595 --> 02:18.596
it's just that now...

02:18.680 --> 02:20.890
What I'm trying to say
is I guess it's been a long time

02:20.974 --> 02:24.269
since I've seen you
without metal.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.520
I know, right.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.819

So what do you mean by "hot"

02:36.447 --> 02:37.740
{\an1}on a scale
of one to ten?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.577
{\an5}Um, anyone mind
if I help myself
to the box?

02:40.660 --> 02:41.870
An 11, Dodie.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.746
Maybe even a 12-- honest.

02:43.830 --> 02:48.376
{\an1}Oh, warm

{\an1}An 11?

02:50.628 --> 02:51.921
For real?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.298
Not that this ain't
riveting conversation

02:53.381 --> 02:56.551
but aren't you three supposed
to be focusing on life science?

Mom, this <i> is</i> life

{\an1}Darren is like
this beautiful butterfly

03:04.100 --> 03:05.602
{\an1}that finally came out
of its cocoon.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.604
Nice segue.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.065
And now he's ready
to spread his wings

03:11.149 --> 03:12.191
and take flight.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.068
Ginger, the last time
you considered

03:14.152 --> 03:15.612
developing feelings for Darren,

03:15.695 --> 03:18.740
the whole thing was, like, over
before it even started.

03:18.823 --> 03:22.285
{\an1}Wildly unrewarding
for us spectators, got to admit.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.204
You guys,
I'm not in love with Darren.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.623
I'm just happy for him.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.960
Really, really happy for him.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.006
He plunged at me
with these huge blades.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.426
They were four,
maybe five feet long.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.385
(<i> girls gasps</i> )

03:39.469 --> 03:40.470
He placed the blades

03:40.553 --> 03:42.305
right inside my mouth,
and crack--

03:42.388 --> 03:44.432
snapped right through the metal.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.058
Did it hurt?

03:45.141 --> 03:49.312
Did it hurt?! Did it hurt?!

03:49.395 --> 03:49.854
No, not really.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.316
(<i> girls laughing</i> )

03:53.399 --> 03:54.233
How could he?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.653
We didn't even
hear the story yet.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.321
{\an1}Okay, let's not jump
the gun, you guys.

03:58.404 --> 04:02.492
{\an4}I'm sure Darren is going
to be heading over here
any minute now.

(<i> girls flirting</i> )

04:09.082 --> 04:14.379
{\an5}GIRL:
Oh, Darren,
oh, you're so strong.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.591
Okay, let's just give
him one more minute.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.804
(<i> kids talking</i> )

04:22.887 --> 04:25.848
Best little monkey
in the whole, wide world.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.267
Yes, you are.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.185
Oh, gosh, Carl.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.812
{\an1}Did Brandon Higsby's
pet monkey die?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.690
It sure sounds that way.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.024
But he was so young.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.401
So full of monkey life.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.236
Higsby, we couldn't
help but overhear.

04:38.319 --> 04:42.115
{\an5}Since you were
practically shouting
and everything.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.242
{\an1}Is your monkey,
like, dead?

04:44.325 --> 04:45.118
Not dead.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.369
Just gone missing.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.537
Somebody stole him.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.580
Best little monkey
in the whole world.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.790
Yes, he was.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.750
Who stole him?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.210
If I knew the answer
to that,

04:54.293 --> 04:55.878
do you think I'd
be standing here

04:55.962 --> 04:58.881
next to the garbage pale
blubbering like a whale?!

04:58.965 --> 05:01.217
{\an1}Whales don't actually
blubber, Brandon.

05:01.300 --> 05:02.635
They only <i> have</i> blubber.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.595
It's an easy
mistake, Carl.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.141
The worse part
is it's been nippy.

05:08.224 --> 05:11.728
It just kills me knowing
he's out there somewhere

05:11.811 --> 05:13.104
without so much as a sweater.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.480
{\an5}I'm offering my
whole life savings
as ransom

05:14.564 --> 05:21.446
but that's only $46.93 and
a glow in the dark sour ball.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.406
The sour ball's lime.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.575
{\an1}Look, Higsby,
you're in luck.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.409
{\an1}Hoodsey and I
just happen

05:26.492 --> 05:30.371
{\an1}to do a little P.I.ing
in our spare time.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.039
P.I.ing?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.582

investigating.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.499
But it's total
poppycock.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.501
{\an1}Is not!

05:35.585 --> 05:38.171
We helped the police
catch that dognapper.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.673
Carl had his picture
in the paper.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.883
Do you really think

05:41.966 --> 05:43.760
you can find
Mr. Licorice for me?

05:43.843 --> 05:47.263
{\an1}I do, and our services fall
within your price range.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.433
Lucky me.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.100
Indeed.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.603
Don't listen
to him, Higsby.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.896
We're prepared
to offer you

05:54.979 --> 05:57.857
a monkey-back-or-your
money-back guarantee.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.442
Now you're talking.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.860
Minus the cost
of supplies.

{\an1}The sour ball
is nonrefundable.

We're firm
on that.

GINGER:
Okay, I'm trying not to freak.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.535
So Darren didn't show up
at lunch.

06:09.619 --> 06:14.540
Does that really mean
he totally forgot I'm alive?

06:14.624 --> 06:17.293
Would you check my
breath for freshness?

06:17.376 --> 06:18.920
My pleasure.

06:21.255 --> 06:25.968
Oh, my gosh, that was
yesterday's lunch.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.389
{\an1}So how about
Darren Patterson?

06:30.473 --> 06:33.309
Is it me or did he turn
total hottie overnight?

06:33.392 --> 06:36.896
{\an5}Are you thinking
what I think
you're thinking?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.147
Spit, Courtney.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.440

{\an1}Did you realize if you and
Darren Patterson hook up

06:45.404 --> 06:48.157
and then me and the fabulous
Will Patterson hook up...

06:48.241 --> 06:51.327
And then we have
a double wedding...

06:51.410 --> 06:52.995
BOTH:
We'll be related!

06:53.079 --> 06:55.039
(<i> giggling wildly</i> )

06:55.123 --> 06:57.667
{\an1}A lot of girls
will go for Darren

06:57.750 --> 06:59.544
{\an1}now that he has
his headgear off.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.587
{\an1}Do you think
I'll get shut out?

07:01.671 --> 07:02.296
Don't be absurd.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.548
After all,
you and he had

07:03.631 --> 07:06.008
that whole summer camp
experience together.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.720
I hope Ginger Foutley
doesn't take the news too hard.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.097
Darren <i> was</i> her B.F.F.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.057
and they're usually
the first to know.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.519
{\an1}Well, in this case,
Darren's B.F.F.

07:16.602 --> 07:21.107
is going to be
the first thing to go.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.496
(<i> camera whirring</i> )

07:40.126 --> 07:40.835
No shoes.

Oh, geez.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.174
House rules, Robert Joseph.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.968
But I'm moist-soled.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.432
Nice place
you got here, Brandon.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.058
Rent or own?

07:56.767 --> 07:59.896
Can I offer you boys
a juice box?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.190
That'd be swell.

08:03.941 --> 08:07.403
Carrot-beet or tropical punch?

08:07.486 --> 08:07.737
Tropical punch!

08:07.820 --> 08:10.031
Uh, duh!

08:10.781 --> 08:12.825
Some joint,
all right.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.791
{\an1}Say, Brandon, no chance
those cameras are installed

08:20.875 --> 08:23.252
{\an1}throughout the entire
Higsby compound.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.421
In every room except
the bathroom,

08:25.504 --> 08:27.423
for obvious reasons.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.759
{\an1}This job may be even easier
than I imagined.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.553
Take me to the room where
the monkey was last seen.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.932
{\an5}GINGER:
And then I overheard Miranda
and Courtney say

08:36.015 --> 08:39.143
Darren would be spending
less time hanging out with me

08:39.227 --> 08:41.770
and they hope
I don't take it too hard.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.272
Take it too hard.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.899
You wouldn't do that.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.108
Yes, she would, Macie.

08:46.192 --> 08:46.901
I stand corrected.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.779
And you know Miranda's
only doing this

08:49.862 --> 08:51.572
to try to make me
feel bad.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.533
I'm not sure about that.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.618

Stop it.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.204
See for yourself.

09:01.540 --> 09:05.127
{\an5}Perhaps our
little butterfly
has indeed flown--

09:05.211 --> 09:06.295
flown away.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.881
Just because Darren has
a girlfriend, that doesn't mean

09:08.965 --> 09:11.175
that he can't hang out
with us anymore... does it?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.803
{\an1}If that girlfriend
is Miranda,

09:13.886 --> 09:15.471
I don't know what
it means, Ginger.

Meet Sherry.

a doting Sherry
couldn't get Norman

09:48.629 --> 09:50.089
to even notice
she was alive.

But after using the patented
Fondfeeling silent treatment,

09:54.176 --> 09:55.177
who's zooming who?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.846
Or should I say "whom?"

09:56.929 --> 09:58.639
You go, girl.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.976
The truth is,
people respond to rejection.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.520
They just do.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.982
It just might work.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.400
Of course it'll work.

10:19.744 --> 10:24.123
in the whole, wide world--
yes, he is-- and me.

10:24.206 --> 10:25.166
Fast-forward.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.294
{\an5}You'll miss the part
where I bless you
and Hoodsey.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.046
{\an1}BRANDON:
Now blow a kiss.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.673
(<i> blows kiss</i> )

10:45.728 --> 10:46.228
CARL:
Aha!

10:46.312 --> 10:49.732
BRANDON:
No, it can't be!

10:49.815 --> 10:55.488
I always thought it
was Stuart who stole my money.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.410
(<i> blows raspberry,</i>
<i>gibbering meanly</i> )

11:01.494 --> 11:04.497
BRANDON:
How could he?!

11:04.580 --> 11:05.164
No!

11:05.247 --> 11:06.082
I don't understand it.

11:06.165 --> 11:11.212
Me and Mr. Licorice,
we were best friends!

11:11.295 --> 11:11.921
Were you, though?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.297
{\an1}You didn't, like,
change his diet

11:13.381 --> 11:15.674
{\an1}or anything
recently, huh?

11:15.758 --> 11:18.636
His diet was
the same as always--

11:18.719 --> 11:21.639
organic fruit,
organic vegetables

11:21.722 --> 11:25.601
and oodles and oodles
of organic love!

11:25.684 --> 11:29.105
(<i> sobbing wildly</i> )

11:29.188 --> 11:32.316
Maybe that's the part
he didn't like.

11:34.985 --> 11:39.115
{\an5}Did you find out
about arranging things
between me and Will?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.033
{\an1}Not yet,
but maybe after school.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.869
{\an1}He's coming with me
to my clarinet lesson.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.414
Then I'm going
to his house for dinner

11:46.497 --> 11:49.125
and then to
my house for dessert.

11:49.208 --> 11:49.959
Oh... oh, I see.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.335
This whole having-
a-boyfriend thing

11:51.419 --> 11:53.629
really eats up
your free time.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.506
Yes, it certainly
seems that way.

11:55.589 --> 11:58.926
Well, I've got to meet
Darren at his locker.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.011
Of course you do.

12:06.058 --> 12:10.020
Follow the Fondfeelings
formula, and just ice him.

12:10.104 --> 12:10.604
See him in the hallway?

12:10.688 --> 12:11.981
Look right through him.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.983
{\an1}(<i> crying</i> )

12:14.066 --> 12:14.775
Courtney... Hi.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.192
Ginger, I was just...

12:15.276 --> 12:16.902
Uh, I had to...

12:16.986 --> 12:18.154
(<i> clears throat</i> )

12:18.237 --> 12:20.156
Would you mind checking
my breath for freshness?

12:20.239 --> 12:22.032
Sure... I guess.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.159
{\an1}This is the sort
of thing

12:23.242 --> 12:25.119
{\an1}Miranda and I used
to do together,

12:25.202 --> 12:26.829
{\an1}before...
well, you know...

12:26.912 --> 12:28.164
Yeah.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.541
Honestly, I never
would have encouraged her

12:30.624 --> 12:32.585
to pursue this
whole Darren thing,

12:32.668 --> 12:34.378
had I known that
she would become

12:34.462 --> 12:36.505
{\an1}so totally and utterly
unavailable to me.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.674
I know exactly how
you feel, Courtney.

12:38.757 --> 12:39.341
{\an1}(<i> yelling</i> ):
No, you don't!

12:39.425 --> 12:41.469
Miranda was my right hand,

12:41.552 --> 12:43.262
and now that she's gone,
it's like, well,

12:43.345 --> 12:46.182
all I have left is the left.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.517
The left, you see?

12:48.601 --> 12:49.643
{\an1}The left!!

12:49.727 --> 12:52.104
{\an5}I've... got to go
work on things
with Darren.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.690
I need both hands,
Ginger, both hands.

12:54.774 --> 12:59.570
And you forgot
to check my breath.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.535
{\an1}According to
Dr. Fondfeelings,

13:06.619 --> 13:07.703
{\an1}if I don't
do something,

13:07.786 --> 13:10.581
{\an4}I'm going to lose
Darren's friendship
forever.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.166
So what are you
going to say?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.126
Nothing--
that's the whole point.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.920
{\an5}You're just going
to walk by,

13:16.003 --> 13:17.880
like you don't
even see him?

13:17.963 --> 13:20.341
Like I don't even see him.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.595
{\an5}Ginge-- I was
just thinking
about you.

13:24.678 --> 13:28.057
{\an4}Listen, Miranda
likes my hair on
a side part,

13:28.140 --> 13:29.183
but I'm not sure.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.643
What do you think?

13:30.726 --> 13:31.602
Ginger?

13:31.685 --> 13:32.978
Hello?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.104
Hello!

13:34.188 --> 13:35.397
{\an1}Oh, hey...

13:35.481 --> 13:37.233
Well, don't sound
so glad to see me.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.360
{\an1}No, sorry,
it's just that...

13:39.443 --> 13:40.027
Darren, we agreed

13:40.110 --> 13:41.445
that you were
going to call me

13:41.529 --> 13:44.448
by a pet name
from now on.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.991
Right, um...

13:46.075 --> 13:47.201
Sorry... Schmoo.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.161
{\an1}Look, I'm just
a little preoccupied

13:49.245 --> 13:50.663
{\an1}because I think
Ginger's mad,

13:50.746 --> 13:52.248
and it may be
because the...

13:52.331 --> 13:54.041
(<i> bell rings</i> )

13:54.124 --> 13:55.459
The bell, and F.Y.I.,

13:55.543 --> 13:56.585
you might want
to stop obsessing

13:56.669 --> 13:58.796
over Ginger
Foutley, P.D.Q!

13:58.879 --> 14:00.673
You only have room
for one woman

14:00.756 --> 14:04.552
in your life now,
and her name is Schmoo.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.229
(<i> sobbing desperately</i> )

14:15.312 --> 14:19.275
There are certain things
you simply cannot own.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.943
It's time you learned that.

14:21.026 --> 14:21.986
{\an1}Wind-baggery,
Higsby.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.821
{\an1}Carl Foutley
just doesn't care

14:23.904 --> 14:25.656
{\an1}to admit
that he's failed.

14:25.739 --> 14:26.949
Failed, I say.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.076
Did not! And mind
your own business.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.328
Did you flush?

14:31.412 --> 14:34.039
Please, no fighting.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.418
Here, take it--
take it all,

14:37.501 --> 14:40.796
but find Mr. Licorice for me.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.923
(<i> sobbing</i> )

14:43.549 --> 14:50.097
(<i> bad clarinet playing</i> )

14:52.308 --> 14:54.810
{\an1}Uh, Schmoo...
remind me again

14:54.893 --> 14:55.603
why I have
to be here?

14:55.686 --> 14:58.272
Uh... it's just
the way the whole

14:58.355 --> 15:00.357
boyfriend-girlfriend
thing operates.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.525
If you don't like
the arrangement...

15:01.609 --> 15:04.820
{\an1}No, no, no, no, no,
it's great.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.071
It's great, really.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.197
Uh, it's just that...

15:07.281 --> 15:09.241
I haven't seen
a whole lot of Ginger

15:09.325 --> 15:11.201
ever since we started dating.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.745
You should thank
me for that.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.496
Look, I made a lot
of sacrifices

15:14.580 --> 15:15.956
for this
relationship, too.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
You should have
seen the look

15:17.750 --> 15:18.667
on Courtney's face

15:18.751 --> 15:20.169
when I told her
I couldn't hang out.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.796
Well, then, maybe
we should take a day off

15:22.880 --> 15:24.506
to spend time with our friends.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.091
But that's not how the whole

15:26.175 --> 15:28.802
boyfriend-girlfriend
dynamic works.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.845
There are things

15:29.928 --> 15:31.889
{\an1}about this boyfriend-
girlfriend dynamic

15:31.972 --> 15:33.515
{\an1}that don't work,
all right.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.516
Oh, yeah? Like what?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.810
{\an1}Like not being
able to see

15:36.894 --> 15:38.228
my friends, for one.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.939
Is this about Ginger again?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.483
{\an1}Look! If I'm
willing to accept

15:42.566 --> 15:43.901
your friends,
like Courtney,

15:43.984 --> 15:45.361
{\an1}then you have to be
willing to accept

15:45.444 --> 15:47.529
my friends, like Ginger.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.947
It's hardly the same,

15:49.031 --> 15:49.531
but fine, Darren, fine.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.076
You don't
have to shout.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.535
{\an1}And another thing,
Schmoo!

15:53.619 --> 15:56.330
{\an1}I don't like
the side part.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.499
{\an1}It's not working
for me!

15:58.582 --> 15:59.708
(<i> gasps</i> )

15:59.792 --> 16:01.001
Well, fine.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.002
Fine.

16:02.086 --> 16:02.711
Fine.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.253
Fine.

16:03.337 --> 16:03.921
Fine.

16:04.004 --> 16:04.463
Fine.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.255
(<i> gasps</i> )

16:05.339 --> 16:06.507
Oh, my gosh.

16:06.590 --> 16:08.926
Our first fight.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.010
Wow.

16:10.094 --> 16:10.803
I guess so.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.221
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

16:12.304 --> 16:13.263
Now go ahead and leave,

16:13.347 --> 16:14.306
but call me later
to make up, okay

16:14.390 --> 16:18.394
{\an5}because that's
what boyfriends
and girlfriends do.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.395
{\an1}Miranda...

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
Shh, shh, shh--
don't speak.

16:20.979 --> 16:25.234
"Icing Darren felt really bad,
but now only time will tell

16:25.317 --> 16:27.403
if such drastic measures
actually worked."

16:27.486 --> 16:29.363
Knock, knock.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.324
Hey, look, Ginger,
I know you're mad.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.701
Is it because of Miranda?

16:33.784 --> 16:36.912
Is it because I didn't
sit with you guys at lunch?

16:36.995 --> 16:37.496
(<i> whistling</i> )

16:37.579 --> 16:39.498
I'm sorry, okay?

16:39.581 --> 16:40.666
I guess I just
got caught up

16:40.749 --> 16:41.750
in all the attention
for a minute.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.920
But come on, do you
have to give me

16:45.003 --> 16:46.088
the silent
treatment?

16:46.171 --> 16:48.424
{\an5}You know,
you blew me off
once or twice

16:48.507 --> 16:50.092
when Courtney
came knocking,

16:50.175 --> 16:51.885
but I never
acted like this.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.845
I just came by
to see

16:52.928 --> 16:54.596
if you wanted
to hang out with me

16:54.680 --> 16:56.265
at the cheese
plate factory

16:56.348 --> 16:57.433
tomorrow
after school.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.935
{\an1}You know,
like old times.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.604
{\an1}(<i> sighs</i> ):
I guess not.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.358
{\an1}I guess...
this is good-bye.

17:12.364 --> 17:12.906
(<i> slurping</i> )

17:12.990 --> 17:15.159
(<i> cash register rings</i> )

17:15.242 --> 17:17.453
It doesn't taste right, Carl.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.537
Too much syrup?

17:18.619 --> 17:21.123
No, it's bitter
with the taste

17:21.205 --> 17:22.708
of unfound monkey.

17:22.790 --> 17:23.791
Relax, Hoods.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.710
I told Brandon

17:24.792 --> 17:27.296
it was minus the
cost of supplies.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.675
Whoa!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.051
Uh-oh.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.512
Let's get him!

17:35.596 --> 17:38.307
I don't know what to do.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.641
{\an1}The silent treatment
kind of worked,

17:39.725 --> 17:40.976
because Darren did show up.

17:41.059 --> 17:45.230
Who says it was the silent
treatment that worked?

17:45.314 --> 17:46.398
Darren is your friend.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.733
{\an5}He was going
to come around
one way or another.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.319
Give him a little
credit, Ginger.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.113
We'll wait for you
in Pierce-a-topia.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.035
That monkey
is a fugitive.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.995
He belongs to
a friend of mine.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.330
I'd know him
anywhere.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.248
(<i> chattering</i> )

18:03.332 --> 18:04.208
That's nonsense.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.168
{\an1}I got him from
my usual supplier.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.378
{\an1}If you want him,
you'll have to pay,

18:08.462 --> 18:10.172
{\an1}just like everyone
else would.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.383
{\an5}It's going to
totally eat up
our profits.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.845
{\an1}It's the right thing to do,
Carl, and you know it.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.180
(<i> groaning</i> )

18:21.642 --> 18:23.644
It's hardly enough.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.020
(<i> hooting</i> )

18:25.103 --> 18:25.854
Shame on you,
Mr. Licorice!

18:25.938 --> 18:29.650
{\an1}You're Brandon's monkey
and you know it.

18:29.733 --> 18:37.533
(<i> loud, terrible screeching</i> )

18:37.616 --> 18:39.535
(<i> sobbing</i> )

18:39.618 --> 18:40.828
On second thought,

18:40.911 --> 18:43.038
take him--
and quickly!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.793
So, mules or clogs,
capris or bootlegs?

18:47.876 --> 18:50.337
Clogs, bootlegs, no,
but that's just me.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.714
Oh, Miranda!

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216
I have been positively
lonesome without you.

18:54.299 --> 18:58.887
Did I tell you that Mipsy
is going to cut her hair?

18:58.971 --> 18:59.888
No way.

18:59.972 --> 19:00.722
No way!

19:00.806 --> 19:01.890
When did this happen?

19:01.974 --> 19:03.308
I'm missing everything.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.393
I never have this kind of

19:04.476 --> 19:07.855
{\an1}thought-provoking
conversation with Darren.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.315
(<i> sighing</i> )

19:10.774 --> 19:12.651
Can I
sit down?

19:12.734 --> 19:13.360
Wow.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.444
Are you actually talking to me?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
Yeah.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.740
I'm sorry, Darren,
sorry I was giving you

19:18.824 --> 19:19.992
the silent treatment.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.743
It's just that first
you dissed me, and...

19:21.827 --> 19:24.288
{\an1}I didn't
diss you, Ginger.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.247
I just got a little

19:25.330 --> 19:26.123
{\an1}caught up for
a minute, that's all.

19:26.206 --> 19:29.459
I know-- I should have
given you a chance.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.045
But Dr. Fondfeelings
said that...

19:32.129 --> 19:32.838
Wow!

19:32.921 --> 19:34.631
You saw a therapist over this?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.008
Not exactly.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.593
She was on Channel 9.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.427
Oh.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.261
I really don't want

19:39.344 --> 19:40.596
to lose you
as a friend,

19:40.679 --> 19:41.388
and if that means

19:41.471 --> 19:42.764
being supportive
of you and Schmoo,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.725
I'm ready to do that.

19:44.808 --> 19:45.601
(<i> clearing throat</i> )

19:45.684 --> 19:48.186
Darren, can I talk to you
for a minute?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.069
This isn't working
out for me

19:56.153 --> 20:00.490
and it's not just because
of the side part either.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.450
Miranda...

20:01.533 --> 20:02.826
Please! Let me finish.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.994
Courtney misses me.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.120
I'm missing everything

20:05.203 --> 20:07.581
and I don't want
to have to pretend

20:07.664 --> 20:09.124
that I like
Ginger Foutley.

20:09.207 --> 20:11.335
{\an1}So, I guess
this is good-bye.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.337
Just so you know.

20:13.420 --> 20:14.421
All things
considered,

20:14.504 --> 20:16.089
you're a pretty
good boyfriend.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.508
{\an1}You weren't bad
yourself, Schmoo.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
Miranda!

20:20.719 --> 20:22.471
Pierce-a-topia
closes early today.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.390
We have to hurry
if we want toe jewelry.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.476
{\an3}Later.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.941
(<i> Miranda and Courtney</i>
<i>giggling</i> )

20:34.650 --> 20:36.026
So... you think
Dodie and Macie

20:36.109 --> 20:37.986
{\an1}will take me back
at the lunch table?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.489
I think I can
pull a few strings.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.407
{\an1}Did someone teach
Macie to rollerblade?

20:42.491 --> 20:45.202
{\an1}Does Dodie still need help
with that book report?

20:45.285 --> 20:47.329
{\an1}Did you seal your
bedroom window shut?

20:47.412 --> 20:50.499
No, yes, and no,
Darren, of course not.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.000
{\an1}(<i> sighs</i>
<i>with relief</i> )

20:52.084 --> 20:54.336
{\an1}Because my
social calendar

20:54.419 --> 20:57.506
{\an1}is about to
really open up.

20:57.965 --> 20:58.882
The thing of it is

20:58.966 --> 21:02.010
he didn't want to come back.

21:02.094 --> 21:02.552
He put up a real fight.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.596
I don't care.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.847
Listen to me, Brandon!

21:05.931 --> 21:06.682
He doesn't like you.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.559
{\an5}Neither do you
and Hoodsey,
but so what?

21:09.643 --> 21:10.852
Don't you see?

21:10.936 --> 21:13.230
The monkey is what
makes me interesting.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.147
Without the monkey,

21:14.231 --> 21:16.024
I'm just an
annoying little boy.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.526
And with the monkey?

21:17.609 --> 21:20.487
I'm an annoying little boy with
a monkey-- that's something.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.531
You can't hide behind
your monkey forever.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.075
{\an3}Hoods.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.536
(<i> chattering</i> )

21:27.619 --> 21:28.745
{\an3}Come on.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.247
(<i> hooting desperately</i> )

21:30.330 --> 21:34.543
{\an5}Talk about a
dysfunctional
relationship.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.545
We should talk.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.797
Oh, yes, Mr. Licorice,
this is your home,

21:38.880 --> 21:41.174
and that
is your cage.

21:41.258 --> 21:41.800
You can't
change that.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.926
(<i> hooting</i> )

21:43.010 --> 21:46.638
I think-- if
I'm not mistaken--

21:46.722 --> 21:49.725
what he wants
to change... is you.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.976
Me?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.644
{\an5}But I know
what's best
for Mr. Licorice.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.980
(<i> wailing</i> )

21:55.063 --> 21:57.816
Wait... I'm willing
to work on this relationship.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.277
Just tell me what to do.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.069
Stop micro-managing
the monkey

22:01.153 --> 22:03.071
and let his cage
get a little dirty.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.615
Let him ditch
that dorky bow-tie.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.492
It's annoying.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.410
It's embarrassing.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.578
It's a little of each.

22:09.661 --> 22:12.247
Point taken,
duly noted.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.041
And boys-- thanks.

22:14.124 --> 22:14.958
Don't mention it.

22:15.042 --> 22:15.792
All in
a day's work.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.628
Let me just tidy up
your fur a smidgen.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.713
(<i> chattering</i> )

22:19.796 --> 22:20.964
BRANDON:
I got you now.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.966
Well, it's like
I always say:

22:23.050 --> 22:23.925
you can lead a horse
to water...

22:24.009 --> 22:25.886
{\an1}But you can't change
his spots.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.055
{\an1}Boy, don't
I know it, brother.

22:28.138 --> 22:31.308
Not exactly
where I was going,

22:31.391 --> 22:32.601
but close enough.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.477
{\an1}HOODSEY:
Hey, Carl?

22:33.560 --> 22:35.103
{\an1}I know it sounds
kind of crazy,

22:35.187 --> 22:36.271
{\an1}but about
that juice box...

22:36.354 --> 22:40.108
{\an4}I kind of regret
not having tried
carrot-beet.

22:40.192 --> 22:40.817
Yeah.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.485
{\an1}I feel
that I should be

22:41.568 --> 22:43.779
{\an1}more open to
new experiences...

22:43.862 --> 22:44.946
You're pretty open.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.198
...and tastes, too.
