WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.700
Give me all your cash!

00:04.787 --> 00:06.397
And some scratchers.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.095
I'm feeling lucky.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.487
[bell jingles]

00:09.574 --> 00:11.185
Be cool.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.664
MIKE: Why do we gotta
come here for a snack?

00:12.751 --> 00:14.231
There's no healthy
choices for me.

00:14.318 --> 00:15.711
Listen, I support you
tryin' to eat right,

00:15.798 --> 00:17.060
but I've been craving
this burrito ever since

00:17.147 --> 00:18.540
we heard that
"La Cucaracha" car horn.

00:18.627 --> 00:21.151
I thought you just
wanted the burrito.

00:21.238 --> 00:22.674
Well, if I'd told you
my whole plan,

00:22.761 --> 00:23.284
you never would have
let me come in here.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.155
Ugh.

00:25.242 --> 00:28.332
This looks like the same apple
that tempted Eve.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.856
You know, there's an interesting
fact about apples.

00:30.943 --> 00:33.033
There are so many varieties that
if you ate a new one every day

00:33.120 --> 00:34.643
it'd take you 20 years
to try them all.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.340
You don't say.CARL:
Yep.

00:36.427 --> 00:37.602
My favorite,
in order:

00:37.689 --> 00:39.648
Gala, Braeburn,
Honeycrisp, Fuji...

00:39.735 --> 00:40.692
No, no, wait, wait.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.694
Fuji before Honeycrisp.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.305
Buddy, you checkin' out
or not?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.698
Back off!
Just back off!
Whoa.

00:46.785 --> 00:47.656
Okay. Take it easy.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.179
Put the gun down.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.137
We can figure
this out.
No! No...

00:50.224 --> 00:51.094
I'm gonna get my money

00:51.181 --> 00:53.053
and my scratchers

00:53.140 --> 00:55.925
and you're gonna let me
walk out of here.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.796
Hey, it's all right.
It's cool.

00:57.883 --> 00:58.449

anything stupid.

I'm hit!
I'm hit!

Officer down!
Officer down!

01:08.329 --> 01:09.417
You all right,
buddy?

01:09.504 --> 01:10.592
No, I'm not
all right!

01:10.679 --> 01:12.159
I got a bullet
in my ass!

01:12.246 --> 01:13.899
Don't just stand there, man.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.466
Go grab some of those maxi pads

01:15.553 --> 01:16.946
and put some pressure on
my partner's backside.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.034
Stay where you are!

01:18.121 --> 01:20.254
Nobody's touching my ass!

01:51.328 --> 01:52.590
Well, luckily
the bullet

01:52.677 --> 01:54.679
passed clean
through the cheek.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.072
But sadly, I think
your thong bikini
days are behind you.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.029
[chuckles]

01:57.117 --> 01:58.727
Oh, don't make me laugh.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.773
MOLLY:
Mike?
Molly!

02:01.860 --> 02:03.471
In here!

02:03.558 --> 02:05.560
Hi. Oh, my God, sweetie,
how are you feeling?

02:05.647 --> 02:07.083
Better, now that you're here.Oh, God.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.693
I'm sorry, I got here
as soon as I could.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.826
But first they sent me
to the wrong hospital,

02:10.913 --> 02:12.523
and then when I got in here,
they wouldn't let me in

02:12.610 --> 02:13.829
because they said
your husband

02:13.916 --> 02:15.396
was already with you...

02:15.483 --> 02:17.224
Hey, I just said "partner"

02:17.311 --> 02:18.747
and "the most important
person in my life."

02:18.834 --> 02:20.227
They're the ones who
made the assumption.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.142
Are they gonna make
you spend the night?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.795
They just want me to stay
for a couple more hours.

02:23.882 --> 02:24.796
Then I can go.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.407
Okay, good.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.409
Let me take you home
and take care of you

02:28.496 --> 02:31.325
and keep you away from
all these bad people.

02:31.412 --> 02:31.977
PEGGY:
Where's my son?

02:32.064 --> 02:33.631
Mike!

02:33.718 --> 02:34.545
Shh, shh, shh.
You should rest.

02:34.632 --> 02:35.590
[mouthing]

02:41.117 --> 02:43.119
Oh, they're home.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.861
Oh, hey.
There he is.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.690
The man with
the Kevlar ass.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.039
Can I get you something
for the pain, sweetie?

02:50.126 --> 02:53.651
Whiskey, vodka,
Mexican NyQuil...

02:53.738 --> 02:56.524
Maybe a Percocet, Vicodin...

02:56.611 --> 02:58.743
I'm out of Demerol, but I can
have some here in an hour.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.832
No, I'm fine.

03:00.919 --> 03:03.052
They loaded me up
with pain pills.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.227
Which I will count
and lock up

03:04.314 --> 03:05.707
at the end
of each night.

03:05.794 --> 03:06.838
I'm gonna get
you some ice.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.059
You should have seen
this man today.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.626
They say don't bring
a knife to a gunfight?

03:11.713 --> 03:13.018
Well, Mike Biggs showed up

03:13.105 --> 03:14.716
with nothing but
a can of Diet Coke.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.849
Just needed one calorie
to take down that dirtbag.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.462
I'm just glad
nobody else was hurt.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.377
Well, you are
a real hero.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.249
Your next meal at
the diner is on the house.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.903
Like it usually is,

03:27.990 --> 03:29.992
but this time I won't
give you crap for it.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.602
Well, that's very generous.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.213
And thank you all
for the concern,

03:33.300 --> 03:34.388
but I'm pretty tired.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.650
I just want
to go to bed.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.042
Yeah? You need me
to sit with you?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.653
Read you a book?

03:38.740 --> 03:40.829
Tickle your back?

03:40.916 --> 03:43.353
It wasn't okay in the hospital,

03:43.440 --> 03:45.616
it's not okay here.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.617
PEGGY:
Come on, boy,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.445
I'll get you upstairs.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.186
Oh, it's okay, I think his wife
can put him to bed.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.362
I think if anybody
should take him up,
it's his mother.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.190
It's time for nurturing,
not nookie.

03:55.626 --> 03:56.801
He got shot.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.194
I'm not trying
to get laid.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.370
Shut your mouth,
that's my son!

04:00.457 --> 04:01.893
Stop it!

04:01.980 --> 04:03.939
I can put myself to bed.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.204
Well... call down
if you need anything.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.641
I'll be up in a little bit.

04:10.728 --> 04:11.903
Shouldn't you be
getting home?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.036
Sun'll be
coming up soon.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.821
Yeah, let-let me take
you home, Mrs. Biggs.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.214
Thank you.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.650
While my boy heals,

04:19.737 --> 04:21.086
you might want
to consider dusting.

04:21.173 --> 04:24.525
I'd hate to lose him
to infection.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.788
Hey, hey, hey, Peggy,
lose this!

04:29.399 --> 04:30.966
Did you just flip off
your mother-in-law?

04:31.053 --> 04:32.924
Not really.
She can't see at night.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.970
It was more for me.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.547
Sweetie, are you okay?

04:46.634 --> 04:49.463
Yeah, I just can't
get comfortable.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.116
I'm gonna go downstairs
for a while.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.075
Oh.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.642
Do you want me to go
downstairs with you

04:54.729 --> 04:56.557
and help you get
set up in a chair?

04:56.644 --> 04:57.732
It's really clean
down there.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.995
I dusted.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.824
No. You, uh...
you keep sleeping.

05:02.911 --> 05:03.781
You know, you've been
through a lot today.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.001
You want to...

05:06.088 --> 05:07.089
maybe talk about it?

05:07.176 --> 05:09.178
Honey, I-I'm fine, really.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.223
Okay?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.965
I'm just gonna go downstairs,
watch some TV.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.880
Mike...

05:15.967 --> 05:17.142
Yeah?

05:17.229 --> 05:19.014
I'm really glad
you're okay.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.233
You know, when I got that
call today, it just...

05:21.321 --> 05:22.234
I know.

05:22.322 --> 05:22.931
I know.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.107
Good night.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.630
Good night.

05:26.717 --> 05:27.457
I love you.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.285
Love you, too.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.895
I agree with Carl.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.071
Your butt's still
really cute.

05:35.378 --> 05:35.900
[spectators shouting on TV]

05:35.987 --> 05:38.033
Hey.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.164
Hey, you're up late.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.340
Come on, have a seat.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.776
I can't.

05:41.863 --> 05:43.647
Somebody shot the thing
I used to sit on.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.215
Boy, you don't realize

05:46.302 --> 05:46.868
how much you use your ass
until you can't.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.437
Here...

05:50.524 --> 05:51.655
I want you
to have this.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.050
Oh, no-- your hemorrhoid pillow?

05:55.137 --> 05:56.181
You deserve it.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.269
I mean, you took a bullet.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.663
All I did was push too hard.

06:01.665 --> 06:02.927
No, thanks.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.973
That poor pillow's
been through enough.

06:07.192 --> 06:08.585
Couldn't
sleep, huh?

06:08.672 --> 06:09.586
No.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.632
[groans]

06:11.719 --> 06:13.111
I just keep
replaying today

06:13.198 --> 06:14.852
over and over again
in my head.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.811
If we'd come in
two minutes earlier

06:16.898 --> 06:18.247
or two minutes later...

06:18.334 --> 06:20.292
if the gun drops
a little different...

06:20.380 --> 06:21.293
Boom.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.294
I'm dead.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.296
No more Mike Biggs.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.733
Well, you can't think about it.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.430
You just gotta
thank God you're alive

06:27.517 --> 06:29.737
and live every day
like it's your last.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.782
You know, you're right, Vince.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.133
I need to talk to somebody

06:35.220 --> 06:36.178
I haven't spoken with
in a long time.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.179
Hand me that phone.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.268
That's the spirit.

06:43.315 --> 06:44.621
Is this Tony?

06:44.708 --> 06:46.797
Hey, Mike Biggs.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.973
How you doin', man?

06:49.060 --> 06:51.628
Yeah, it's been a while.

06:51.715 --> 06:55.066
Listen, I'd like to order
a pepperoni pizza.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.376
You want in on this?

07:00.463 --> 07:01.943
What about your diet?

07:02.030 --> 07:04.946
You gonna judge me, or join me?

07:06.513 --> 07:07.775
Ah, what the hell.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.690
Pineapples and jalapeños.

07:09.777 --> 07:09.951
Tonight, we ride!

07:11.996 --> 07:13.650
[speaking indistinctly]

07:16.653 --> 07:19.569
No, he's still in bed, Carl.

07:19.656 --> 07:22.398
Yeah, well, he had
a pretty restless night.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.008
Yes, he...

07:24.095 --> 07:26.054
he does look like
a little sleeping angel.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.884
No, I'm not gonna take
a picture and send it to you.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.844
Because it's weird.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.019
Okay.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.500
Okay, I'll...

07:37.587 --> 07:38.806
Okay, I'll have him call you
when he gets up.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.852
He loves you, too.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.419
Okay, bye...

07:43.506 --> 07:44.638
Okay, bye.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.987
Bye!

07:46.074 --> 07:47.510
Oh, my God.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.991
My sister-wife
has got to chill out.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.387
Huh.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
Oh, boy.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.916
Oh, that's not good.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.961
That's not good at all.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.791
I got Zantac,

08:07.878 --> 08:09.619
I got Tums,
I got Mylanta...

08:09.706 --> 08:11.099
Gimme 'em all.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.231
Feels like I swallowed
a nest of fire ants.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.233
What's wrong
with him?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.234
Oh, heartburn,

08:16.321 --> 08:17.845
diarrhea...

08:17.932 --> 08:19.368
Oh, it was so bad
I made him use the bathroom

08:19.455 --> 08:22.327
at the 76 station
down the street.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.894
Does this have anything to do

08:23.981 --> 08:25.679
with the pizza boxes
in the trash?

08:25.766 --> 08:28.682
I-I promised not to tell.

08:28.769 --> 08:29.944
Come on, your word
is meaningless.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.902
Spill it.

08:31.989 --> 08:32.990
All right.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.470
It was just supposed to be

08:34.557 --> 08:36.124
a late-night pizza
between friends.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.648
But then your husband
got this look in his eyes.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.477
They went dead, like a shark's.

08:41.564 --> 08:44.306
I know that look.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.134
He kept circling
the pizza boxes,

08:46.221 --> 08:48.092
just eating and eating.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.007
At one point, we had delivery
guys stacked up three deep,

08:50.094 --> 08:54.359
like planes waitin'
to land at O'Hare.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.013
Come on, you know
he's on a diet.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.711
Why didn't you
try to stop him?

08:57.798 --> 08:59.451
I asked myself the same question

08:59.539 --> 09:01.932
while I was squattin'
over a gas station toilet.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.418
I'm just thankful
to OA for helping me

09:09.505 --> 09:11.246
get my eating
under control.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.073
How you holding up,
buddy?

09:12.160 --> 09:13.465
I'm fine.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.946
I heard about what
happened yesterday.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.601
It was just
a little pizza.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.430
I was talking about
you being shot.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
Oh, yeah,
that was awful.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.697
So, would anyone else
like to share?

09:31.048 --> 09:33.050
Fine.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.663
Hi, my name's Mike.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.664
I'm an overeater.

09:37.751 --> 09:38.665
ALL:
Hi, Mike.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.710
I slipped up last night.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.233
I ate a little more
than I should've.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.018
Was that good? No.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.846
But I had kind of a rough day.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.674
You know, the kind of day

09:47.761 --> 09:49.676
where the bad guys use your ass
for target practice?

09:52.113 --> 09:54.115
So what if I've had
a few pizzas, some wings,

09:54.202 --> 09:58.206
a little cheesecake,
and a can of frosting?

09:58.293 --> 10:01.252
He's got food issues.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.253
MIKE:
I could have

10:02.340 --> 10:03.690
died last night.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.517
So I ate. Big deal.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.475
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
Too late.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.608
Somebody already did!

10:10.305 --> 10:11.175
Hey, you know what?

10:11.262 --> 10:12.699
Screw this.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.526
I'm going over to
the AA meeting next door.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.921
They got better stories
and they have snacks!

10:21.142 --> 10:23.100
Shut up, Harry.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.458
[doorbell rings]

10:33.545 --> 10:35.112
Have you seen Mike?

10:35.199 --> 10:37.811
No, but I saw you flip me
the bird the other night.

10:39.247 --> 10:40.291
How did you
see that?

10:40.378 --> 10:43.381
I got the cataract surgery!

10:45.122 --> 10:47.777
Hey, good for you.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.561
When's the last time
you saw him?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.433
He was hobbling out
of our OA meeting.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.565
Can you blame him?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.785
Nothing worse than
those boo-hoo groups.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.352
I deal with my issues
the old-fashioned way.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.441
I drink.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.662
What's this?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.446
Making a feel-good pudding
for the boy.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.752
Really?

11:05.839 --> 11:07.797
Food is the last thing he needs.Hey.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.538
I know how to heal my own son.

11:09.625 --> 11:10.974
It wasn't a cast

11:11.061 --> 11:12.889
that fixed his broken arm
when he was six.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.325
It was banana pudding,

11:14.412 --> 11:16.066
morning, noon and night.
And when that cast

11:16.153 --> 11:17.067
couldn't fit anymore,

11:17.154 --> 11:19.853
we knew he was healed.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.419
Are you insane?

11:21.506 --> 11:23.421
Pudding is not medicinal!

11:23.508 --> 11:24.640
Calm down.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.120
No, I will
not calm down.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.774
My husband was shot

11:27.861 --> 11:29.514
and he won't talk
to me about it,

11:29.601 --> 11:31.952
and now he's eating himself
into an early grave.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.171
And I thought maybe you
would want to help me

11:34.258 --> 11:36.347
because you're the only other
person in this entire world

11:36.434 --> 11:37.653
who loves him as much as I do.

11:38.654 --> 11:41.439
Come here.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.485
Why?

11:44.573 --> 11:46.183
Just come here!

11:46.270 --> 11:48.838
Put the knife down.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.323
Oh, my God....
what are you doing?

11:55.410 --> 11:58.021
I'm hugging you.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.154
And no one needs
to know about this.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.417
Well, I'm certainly
not going

12:02.504 --> 12:04.419
to tell anybody
about it.

12:04.506 --> 12:05.507
Okay.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.037
There you are.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.909
Man, do you have any
idea how many people

12:15.996 --> 12:17.214
are out there
looking for you?

12:17.301 --> 12:19.303
Three.

12:22.437 --> 12:25.222
Yes.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.571
Well, thanks for coming.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.269
I have something
I want to say to you.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.358
You're sorry?

12:30.445 --> 12:32.273
I quit.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.622
What are you
talking about?

12:33.709 --> 12:35.798
I want you to turn
my badge in for me.

12:35.885 --> 12:36.886
[scoffs]
Get outta here.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.759
I'm done.
I don't need it.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.325
First of all, no.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.023
And secondly, when we
do decide to quit,

12:43.110 --> 12:44.807
that's gonna be a decision
that we make together.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.591
As a couple.
Oh...

12:48.768 --> 12:49.856
Just take
the damn badge.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.161
What... I will not!

12:51.248 --> 12:51.945
And what has
gotten into you?

12:52.032 --> 12:53.990
A bullet, okay?

12:56.601 --> 12:57.951
Okay.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.996
Thank you.

13:01.215 --> 13:02.564
Well, I tell you what,

13:02.651 --> 13:03.826
you've had a...
a long couple of days.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.045
Why don't I just
drive you home?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.220
That's probably
a good idea.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.525
The bartender cut me off.

13:07.612 --> 13:08.744
Yeah? You don't
seem that drunk.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.790
From the nachos.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.670
Man...

13:21.757 --> 13:23.628
we have patrolled
every inch of this city.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.326
We sure have.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.197
Look.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.416
There's the park where
we busted that carriage driver

13:28.503 --> 13:29.809
for selling drugs.

13:29.896 --> 13:30.940
Yeah, I knew
something was fishy.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.420
Too many junkies were taking

13:32.507 --> 13:34.117
romantic rides
around the duck pond.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.249
[chuckles]

13:35.336 --> 13:36.772
You're a damn good cop,

13:36.859 --> 13:38.426
'cause you're the one
who figured out

13:38.513 --> 13:39.993
that he was hiding the drugs
in the manure bag.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.603
You know what still
gnaws at me, though?
Hmm?

13:41.690 --> 13:44.345
Where did
that horse poop?

13:44.432 --> 13:45.737
Oh!

13:45.825 --> 13:46.869
And there goes
the building

13:46.956 --> 13:48.175
where you saved
that jumper.

13:48.262 --> 13:49.524
Yeah, that one
could have gone

13:49.611 --> 13:51.091
a couple different ways.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.919
[scoffs] Not with Mike
Biggs on the job.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.746
I still can't believe that
you went out on that ledge.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.270
God, you remember how afraid
of heights you used to be?

13:56.357 --> 13:57.358
I still am.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.359
I just worked through it.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.490
It's what you gotta do.

13:59.577 --> 14:00.622
Well, whatever you did,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.667
you saved a man's life.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.541
I know what you're doing, Carl.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.151
Yeah, is it working?

14:08.238 --> 14:10.240
I could take you by
that drain pipe

14:10.327 --> 14:11.546
where you rescued
that stuck kitten

14:11.633 --> 14:12.939
and the fire department

14:13.026 --> 14:14.549
had to come rescue
the stuck you.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.638
Just drive.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.521
Hey.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.872
Oh. Thanks for
coming home.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.440
Sorry, I... had
to work some things out.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.056
What are you doing?

14:43.143 --> 14:46.189
I'm making a sundae
as big as my head.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.106
You trying to make me feel bad?

14:50.193 --> 14:52.108
No, I'm trying
to make me feel good.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.330
Molly, please, don't...
don't-don't do this.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.636
I was wrong.

14:58.723 --> 14:59.899
I should've talked to you.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.598
You know, if you
can't come to me,

15:03.685 --> 15:05.948
and I can't come to you,
then what are we doing here?

15:08.646 --> 15:09.691
I said I was wrong.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.606
I mean, what else can I say?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.740
I just want us
to remember this moment

15:15.827 --> 15:17.829
the next time I screw up.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.401
Let's throw this away.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.968
[sighs]

15:26.055 --> 15:27.622
It won't take
anything away from

15:27.709 --> 15:29.102
what happened
to you yesterday,

15:29.189 --> 15:30.538
but I had a bit of

15:30.625 --> 15:32.366
a traumatic
experience myself.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.628
What happened?

15:33.715 --> 15:35.673
Your mother hugged me.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.068
Really?

15:39.155 --> 15:40.243
Yeah.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.462
And the worst part was...

15:41.549 --> 15:43.507
it was kind of nice.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.989
Let's go to bed.

16:08.271 --> 16:08.880
I've eaten worse.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.024
Brought you a snack.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.939
I'm back on the wagon
again, Vince.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.942
Same here-- sugar-free Jell-O
and nonfat whipped cream.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.423
I packed on six pounds
being your binge buddy.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.816
That's not that bad.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.601
Are you kidding? On my frame,

16:33.688 --> 16:35.429
goes right to my neck,
like I swallowed a fanny pack.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.865
[chuckling]

16:36.952 --> 16:38.258
Thanks.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.650
Well, how's the
bullet hole healing?

16:39.737 --> 16:43.480
Ah, Molly says
my twerking days are over.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.092
I don't know what that is.

16:46.179 --> 16:49.399
Neither do I, but she sure
thought it was funny.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.142
You're probably going to have
a nice scar back there.

16:53.229 --> 16:56.537
Speaking of which-- have I
ever shown you this one?

16:56.624 --> 16:57.407
Looks like you were
stapled or something.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.627
I was bartending

16:59.714 --> 17:02.804
on a cruise ship and I got bit
by a buck-tooth Russian gal.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.327
Caught me on the lido deck

17:04.414 --> 17:07.287
playing topless shuffleboard
with her sister.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.376
See this?

17:09.463 --> 17:10.594
Bar fight?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.901
Trombone scar.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.946
High school July 4th parade.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.513
Shriner in a mini-car
stopped short.

17:16.600 --> 17:20.996
Even with all the blood,
I never missed a note.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.258
Impressive.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.304
You see this one?

17:24.391 --> 17:26.219
Went camping
with a little person

17:26.306 --> 17:28.830
and they caught me on the back
of the head with a shovel.

17:28.917 --> 17:29.396
What the hell
did you do to him?

17:29.483 --> 17:32.355
Her.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.014
Did you know they don't like
being called midgets anymore?

17:40.015 --> 17:42.017
Yes. Yes, I did.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.281
You want the rest of this?

17:45.368 --> 17:46.413
Sure. You don't like it?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.241
Nah.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.546
I'm gonna roll the dice,

17:49.633 --> 17:51.592
maybe see what's
in the garbage.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.162
Shovel to the head
explains a lot.
