00:04.255 --> 00:06.246
(birds chirping)

00:39.540 --> 00:41.246
( chuckles )

01:18.746 --> 01:20.737
Looks good.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.087
Hi.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.255
Hello.

01:33.678 --> 01:36.590
( spoon clattering )

01:36.764 --> 01:38.755
You can lower that.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.568
What's the W for?

01:57.493 --> 01:59.859
You know,
the first settlers here,

02:00.037 --> 02:03.279
they put bounties
on wolves' heads.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.119
Brought the natives into it.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.080
Made them hunt them.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.462
Didn't take them too long
to kill them all.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.677
They're back now.

02:19.724 --> 02:21.430
Thoughts?

02:24.061 --> 02:26.222
Everything gets a return.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.607
- Are you shitting me?
- No, l shit you not.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.359
(both laughing)

02:36.073 --> 02:38.109
I like this.

02:39.243 --> 02:40.904
Just talking.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.409
( laughs)

02:42.580 --> 02:47.040
I don't get to meet
new people very often.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.497
Maybe once
every two weeks.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.208
- That's a lot.
- Oh, I work at it.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.919
We do.

02:56.093 --> 03:00.427
Sometimes we find camps.
We run through them.

03:00.598 --> 03:02.429
But we have traps, too.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.845
It's different.
It's not like meeting like this.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.354
As equals.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.735
Little chats in front of a fire
with a stranger.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.447
That's the closest thing
to movies now.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.947
I miss the movies.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.657
| used to-- put that down.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.618
Why?

03:28.793 --> 03:30.374
'Cause I want it.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.249
I want everything you have.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.248
Every last drop.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.133
Can I keep a little of it?

03:40.304 --> 03:41.589
Just to get me through
a day or two?

03:41.764 --> 03:44.301
You know,
just to keep me alive?

03:45.810 --> 03:47.801
I'm taking you, too.

03:49.105 --> 03:52.643
And you're not exactly
gonna be alive.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.820
Okay.

04:01.492 --> 04:04.359
Some of the tribes
around here,

04:04.537 --> 04:10.248
they thought that the first people
were wolves transformed into men.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.996
And now...

04:14.171 --> 04:16.662
well, you know.

04:17.842 --> 04:20.128
Everything gets
a return, right?

04:23.681 --> 04:26.593
You can have my supplies.
You can have everything.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.263
Doesn't need
to be any ugliness.

04:31.814 --> 04:34.601
But I can't allow you
to take me away.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.393
I will not allow that.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.739
Don't move.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.993
(sighs)

04:49.665 --> 04:54.159
Just be still.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.713
Just be still.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.882
(grunts)

05:18.652 --> 05:21.439
Morgan:
You should just go now.

05:21.614 --> 05:23.104
No.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.496
Just go.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.586
Please.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.380
Now!

06:00.444 --> 06:02.776
(snarling )

06:04.240 --> 06:05.605
( clicks )

06:05.783 --> 06:09.617
( clicking )

06:32.518 --> 06:35.476
( honks horn )

06:47.950 --> 06:50.817
(theme music playing )

08:22.795 --> 08:25.502
( groans )

08:43.691 --> 08:45.898
( chuckles )

08:47.736 --> 08:49.852
( groans )

08:51.865 --> 08:53.901
Michonne:
What's so funny?

08:56.078 --> 08:57.943
You were here
the whole time?

08:58.122 --> 09:00.488
All night.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.156
What's so funny?

09:05.254 --> 09:08.371
lt's-- it's like the train car.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.626
After the whole thing,

09:13.804 --> 09:15.669
I'm still there.

09:18.142 --> 09:21.430
Deanna wanted you in here,
calm things down.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.975
Rosita patched you up.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.685
Carl came by for a while.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.474
I sent him home.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.646
Rick.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.110
What are you doing?

09:40.289 --> 09:42.701
(sighs)

09:47.212 --> 09:49.498
We put Pete
in another house.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.128
You could have told me
what was happening.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.008
lt moved fast.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.090
And then Noah.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.217
I couldn't tell you
about the gun.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.805
No, you couldn't.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.187
Oh, you wanted this place.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.894
We had to stop being out there.

10:13.947 --> 10:18.190
Well, we're here.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.868
( Michonne scoffs)

10:22.039 --> 10:25.497
Well, you just said you weren't.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.917
( door opens)

10:35.552 --> 10:38.385
Michonne:
Where'd you get the gun?

10:38.555 --> 10:41.547
Carol: You took it, right?
From the armory?

10:43.185 --> 10:46.393
That was stupid.
Why did you do it?

10:51.568 --> 10:54.184
Just in case.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.524
Glenn: Deanna's planning
to have a meeting tonight.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.778
For anyone who wants to.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.781
- To kick Rick out?
- To try.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.193
We don't know that.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.032
Maggie's with Deanna right now.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.867
She's gonna find out what it is.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.906
At the meeting,
you say you were worried

11:08.085 --> 11:09.495
about someone being abused

11:09.670 --> 11:11.581
and no one was doing
anything about it.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.996
You say you took a gun
just to be sure

11:14.174 --> 11:16.961
that Jessie was safe from a man
who wound up attacking you.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.750
You say you'll do
whatever you want them to.

11:18.929 --> 11:22.262
Just tell them a story
that they want to hear.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.469
It's what I've been doing
since I got here.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.009
Why?

11:27.187 --> 11:30.850
Because these people are children
and children like stories.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.811
What happens
after all the nice words

11:33.986 --> 11:35.942
and they still try
to kick him out?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.445
They're guarding
the armory now.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.776
We still have knives.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.862
That's all we'll need
against them.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.196
Well, tonight at the meeting...

11:48.250 --> 11:52.038
if it looks like it's going bad,
| whistle.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.797
Carol grabs Deanna,
I take Spencer, you grab Reg,

11:56.967 --> 11:59.299
Glenn and Abraham cover us,
watch the crowd.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.677
- We can talk to them.
- Yeah, we will.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.554
If we can't get through,

12:04.725 --> 12:07.933
we take the three of them
and say we'll slit their throats.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.309
Like at Terminus?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.970
No, wejust tell 'em.

12:12.149 --> 12:15.687
They give us the armory
and it's over.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.728
Did you want this?

12:19.907 --> 12:22.273
No.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.816
I hit my limit.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.952
|-- I screwed up.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.160
And here we are.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.921
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just gonna sleep some more.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.032
Reg: Maggie, hey.
She's out on the porch.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.202
What do you need
to talk about, Maggie?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.912
The meeting tonight.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.451
Maggie, if we could talk--

13:15.629 --> 13:16.960
I want to talk to everyone
about what happened

13:17.130 --> 13:18.540
and what we need
to do about it.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.799
If it includes sending Rick away,
it's not gonna work.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.426
Tell me what that means.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.713
You let Rick in.
You let all of us in.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.301
You talked to us.
You decided.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.553
And now you want
to put that decision

13:34.731 --> 13:35.891
on a group
of very frightened people

13:36.066 --> 13:38.557
who might not have
the whole story.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.236
That's not leadership.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.645
Well, tonight is just a forum.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.609
It's just for people
to say their piece.

13:44.783 --> 13:47.570
And I'll make the decision
as I've done since the beginning.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.326
He was frustrated.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.739
The things he's seen.
The things he's lost.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.453
The things we have all lost.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.458
The things you've lost?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.380
We've lost so much more.

14:02.551 --> 14:05.463
Rick took a gun
and he pointed it at people.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.922
He didn't pull the trigger.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.588
That's a metric?
That he didn't pull the trigger?

14:09.766 --> 14:13.930
- Yes.
- Michonne stopped him, Deanna.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.469
Michonne did.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.229
I'm gonna do
what I have to do, Maggie.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.150
Maggie.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.360
Look, Maggie.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.914
The cavemen...

14:41.214 --> 14:43.205
they were all nomads.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.217
And they all died.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.754
Then we evolved into this
and we lived.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.642
Civilization starts
when we stop running.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.311
When we live together.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.647
When we stop
sending people away

15:01.818 --> 15:04.685
from the world
and from each other.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.819
That's what I'm going
to tell her.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.700
That's what I'm going
to tell everyone.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.156
Okay?

16:20.021 --> 16:21.761
(sighs)

17:00.270 --> 17:02.477
Somebody came through here
a while ago.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.387
If we see them,
we hang back,

17:04.566 --> 17:08.525
set up the mike,
watch and listen.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.356
For how long?

17:11.573 --> 17:13.734
Until we know.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.649
We have to know.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.239
You've sent people away?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.914
Yeah.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.619
What happened?

17:24.920 --> 17:26.956
It was early on.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.836
It was three people.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.790
Two men and a woman.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.382
Davidson was their leader.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.797
Smart as hell, strong.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.761
I thought they'd work out.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.765
They didn't.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.764
I brought them in
and I had to see them out.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.526
So me, Aiden,
and Nicholas,

17:51.696 --> 17:55.814
we drove them out far...

17:57.702 --> 18:02.196
gave them a day's worth
of food and water and left them.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.409
They just went?

18:07.587 --> 18:09.168
We had their guns.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.877
We had all the guns.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.294
I can't make
that kind of mistake again.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.427
Wake up.

18:28.525 --> 18:31.107
It's good what happened
last night.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.690
We have more cover now.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.277
All of them think you've been
found out, that it's over.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.493
Why didn't you want to tell them
we had more guns?

18:50.922 --> 18:53.709
Michonne stopped you.
She knocked you out.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.874
Well, | deserved it.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.008
Well, it was stupid.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.342
She's with us.
Glenn is.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.553
I didn't tell them
about the guns just in case.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.305
(sighs)

19:11.901 --> 19:14.392
I don't want to lie anymore.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.068
You said you don't want
to take this place.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.153
And you don't want to lie?

19:22.871 --> 19:26.739
Oh, sunshine,
you don't get both.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.348
Aaron:
What's he doing?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.259
Daryl:
Wild leeks.

19:50.273 --> 19:53.265
Son of a bitch knows about
how to keep mosquitos off of him.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.685
Come on.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.463
Hey, Tobin.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.249
Hey, Rick.

20:56.089 --> 20:58.080
- You met with her?
- Yeah.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.998
So what is it?

21:00.176 --> 21:02.167
It's what we thought.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.926
I'm gonna talk to people.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.214
I'll talk to everyone I can
right up until.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.383
I'm gonna try to solve this.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.599
What?

21:19.654 --> 21:21.235
What?

21:22.532 --> 21:24.523
I love you.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.695
We're gonna work it out.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.534
I know it.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.285
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.346
( metal rattling )

22:01.613 --> 22:03.695
Sure you don't want
a gun, Father?

22:03.865 --> 22:05.571
| just want a quick walk.

22:08.036 --> 22:10.869
The word of God
is the only protection I need.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.756
Carl:
Dad.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.256
Hey.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.587
You okay?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.343
Yeah.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.379
Look, I'm sorry.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.263
I heard about the meeting.

22:31.434 --> 22:33.049
You're staying home.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.435
That's what it is now, right?

22:35.605 --> 22:37.266
Home?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.311
Yeah.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.776
They need us.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.942
They'll die without us.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.957
I might have to threaten
one of them.

22:59.462 --> 23:00.963
I could have
to kill one of them.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.416
- You won't.
- I might.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.749
You have to tell them.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.384
I told them last night.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.171
You have to tell them
so they can hear you.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.143
I don't know if they can.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.098
Does that make you afraid?

23:22.277 --> 23:25.269
Just for them.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.402
You have to tell them.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.944
(walkers snarling )

23:41.296 --> 23:44.504
We checked the forest,
we checked the roads.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.423
We can't find him.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.381
Sometimes they slip away.
lthappens.

23:50.555 --> 23:51.886
But...

23:53.433 --> 23:55.765
you don't come across
something like this every day.

23:59.647 --> 24:03.185
We do this now,
it means we're giving up.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.027
Home is 50 miles back.
It's time to go.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.688
You saw it last night.
There's bad people out here.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.779
That's why we ought to keep
looking for the good ones.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.071
We need more people
and we'll find them.

24:18.249 --> 24:22.208
But when we do,
we'll need to feed them.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.540
All right.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.800
(metal ringing)

24:30.970 --> 24:33.256
(snarling )

24:33.431 --> 24:35.547
(flesh squelching )

25:03.461 --> 25:05.497
- ( cans clanging )
- ( wind whistling)

25:28.611 --> 25:30.112
Huh.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.187
Whoa.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.322
( chuckles )

25:35.493 --> 25:37.529
Wasn't sure I'd ever
see one of these.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.616
Hey, listen, I don't
like giving up either,

25:44.794 --> 25:48.161
but the guy is in a red poncho.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.796
You can see him
from a mile away.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.758
We've gone a lot of miles here.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.715
No sign of him.

25:59.976 --> 26:01.637
But...

26:01.811 --> 26:05.770
if we come away
with a trailer full of cans,

26:05.940 --> 26:07.931
I'd say that's a good trip.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.444
Here we go.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.817
(snarling )

26:38.514 --> 26:40.050
Over here!

26:41.768 --> 26:43.349
Daryl:
Come on!

26:56.574 --> 26:58.360
- No!
- Come on.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.888
Come on!
Go!

27:52.255 --> 27:54.086
Glass will hold for a while, right?

27:54.257 --> 27:56.213
Maybe.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.375
Maybe we can make it
so they can't see us.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.845
In a couple hours,
something will come by,

28:03.015 --> 28:05.097
they'll follow it out.

28:05.268 --> 28:08.010
There's got to be something in here
we can use to block the view.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.848
We can cut up these seats.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.449
( knocking at door)

28:35.089 --> 28:36.499
( knocking )

28:36.674 --> 28:38.710
(sighs)

28:43.264 --> 28:45.129
( knocking )

28:50.813 --> 28:52.349
What the hell are you doing?

28:52.523 --> 28:54.639
You need to check on Tara.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.057
You treated her.
You're a surgeon.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.315
You need to do that.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.272
Get out.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.116
I could kill you right now.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.742
I could.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.249
lwill.

29:13.419 --> 29:18.914
And then who would believe I did it
because I didn't like you?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.627
No one.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.423
They'd believe
you tried to hurt me.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.091
Definitely believe that.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.260
( gasps )

29:36.025 --> 29:38.232
Come at me.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.693
No?

29:46.327 --> 29:48.033
Yeah?

29:50.289 --> 29:52.029
No.

29:54.418 --> 29:57.125
The way this has played out,
you have a chance.

30:00.716 --> 30:02.707
You're here.

30:02.885 --> 30:04.796
Your wife's there.

30:11.811 --> 30:15.178
You're a small, weak nothing.

30:16.399 --> 30:21.063
And with the world how it is,
you're even weaker.

30:23.489 --> 30:27.903
Play your cards right,
maybe you don't have to die.

30:31.205 --> 30:34.163
And I want my dish back clean
when you're done.

30:44.927 --> 30:47.634
Pete:
This isn't my house.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.387
( furniture crashes )

30:50.558 --> 30:52.890
This isn't my house!

31:20.629 --> 31:22.460
( branch snaps)

31:24.133 --> 31:26.124
(gunshot)

31:44.987 --> 31:46.568
(sighs)

31:47.907 --> 31:49.568
You should go.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.903
ljust wanted to check on you.

31:56.457 --> 31:58.823
Ybureye.

31:59.001 --> 32:00.582
He did it right when
it was happening.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.368
It wasn't you.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.924
People shouldn't see us
talking right now.

32:11.889 --> 32:14.346
I'm not sorry I did it.

32:16.685 --> 32:20.678
No matter what happens
or what I have to do.

32:23.192 --> 32:25.478
Don't turn around, Rick.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.855
You were right.

32:53.848 --> 32:55.930
( chuckles )

32:57.852 --> 32:59.388
What?

33:02.565 --> 33:04.476
I came out here to...

33:05.693 --> 33:07.775
not feel all closed up back there.

33:10.614 --> 33:15.324
Even now,
this still feels more like me...

33:17.371 --> 33:19.532
than back in them houses.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.292
That's pretty messed up, huh?

33:25.045 --> 33:26.546
You were trying.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.171
I had to.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.092
No, you didn't.

33:34.263 --> 33:38.176
Listen, I saw you with your group
out there on the road.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.183
Then you went off
on your own by the barn.

33:43.230 --> 33:48.020
Storm hit and you led
your people to safety.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.064
That was it.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.866
I knew I had to bring
you people back.

33:57.912 --> 33:59.493
You were right.

33:59.663 --> 34:02.530
We should have kept looking
for that guy in the poncho.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.246
I shouldn't have given up.

34:07.463 --> 34:08.703
You didn't.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.347
I'll go.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.720
l'll lead them out.
You make a break for the fence.

34:23.854 --> 34:26.721
No, no, no.
This was my fault.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.140
It wasn't a question.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.058
And this ain't your decision.

34:32.321 --> 34:34.277
It ain't nobody's fault.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.656
Just let me finish
my smoke first.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.951
No. You don't draw them away.

34:46.335 --> 34:48.326
We fight.

34:48.504 --> 34:51.041
We go for the fence.
We do it together.

34:51.215 --> 34:53.501
All right,
whether we make it or not,

34:53.676 --> 34:55.541
we do it together.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.172
We have to.

35:07.523 --> 35:09.184
All right.

35:11.694 --> 35:13.776
- You ready?
- Yeah.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.358
We'll go on three.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.700
One, two--

35:41.974 --> 35:44.181
Come on.
Come on, get in here.

35:58.198 --> 36:00.405
That was--

36:00.576 --> 36:03.659
that was-- thank you.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.583
l'm Aaron, this is Daryl.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.290
Morgan.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.543
Why?

36:18.927 --> 36:20.428
Why?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.092
Because all life
is precious, Daryl.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.348
Whoever set that trap,
they're coming.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.013
But I have good news.
We do.

36:33.192 --> 36:36.150
We have a community
not too far from here.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.107
Walls, electricity, it's safe.

36:39.281 --> 36:40.691
If you'd like to come join us--

36:40.866 --> 36:42.697
I thank you.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.073
But I'm on my way
somewhere.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.704
Fact is, I'm lost, so...

36:51.293 --> 36:52.829
if you could tell me
where we are.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.468
(whistling tune)

37:13.649 --> 37:16.061
(munching)

37:21.490 --> 37:23.697
(whistling louder)

37:36.505 --> 37:38.086
I'm ready.

37:41.385 --> 37:43.922
(snarling )

37:48.767 --> 37:50.803
I'm ready.

38:12.374 --> 38:14.410
(gurgling)

38:18.088 --> 38:20.124
(whimpers)

38:25.554 --> 38:27.044
( splats )

38:32.394 --> 38:35.010
(gasping, gurgling)

38:49.411 --> 38:51.151
( splats )

38:57.169 --> 38:59.455
(sobbing )

39:16.772 --> 39:19.434
Oh.
I'll come by later.

39:19.608 --> 39:21.439
He's asleep.

39:23.654 --> 39:25.485
He's asleep.
Sit.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.004
( clatters )

39:52.182 --> 39:53.968
Whoops.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.646
Good afternoon.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.581
Eugene:
She saved my life.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.124
She also cracked
open my gourd

40:21.295 --> 40:24.128
to considering
implications I hadn't.

40:24.298 --> 40:26.630
I will remark about those
at this time.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.210
You got us here.

40:33.265 --> 40:36.883
All I did was craft
a top-shelf lie

40:37.060 --> 40:39.847
to which a person with strength
and heroism could apply their talents.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.138
My bet was you needed that.

40:45.485 --> 40:47.350
I thank you.

40:49.531 --> 40:52.068
lam sorry.

40:52.242 --> 40:55.234
And I mean both emphatically
and in equal measure.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.756
l'm...

41:13.347 --> 41:14.712
sorry, too.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.881
Utterly and completely
unnecessary.

41:17.059 --> 41:19.141
I almost killed you.

41:20.437 --> 41:23.770
Yes, there's that.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.202
You're back.

41:40.374 --> 41:42.660
Good, just wanted
to sneak off to the meeting.

41:47.756 --> 41:50.748
You think we could find
some time to talk later?

41:50.926 --> 41:52.837
About Aiden?

41:53.011 --> 41:54.421
Just some things
I need to say

41:54.596 --> 41:56.962
and I'm not sure
who I can say them to.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.257
I don't really have
anyone here right now,

42:00.435 --> 42:02.266
if you know what I mean.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.098
I'll see.

42:05.315 --> 42:07.431
Cool.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.474
Can you get that?

42:09.653 --> 42:11.769
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.591
(snarling )

42:51.570 --> 42:52.810
(gunshot)

42:52.988 --> 42:55.149
(grunts)

42:58.869 --> 43:00.700
( screams )

43:05.792 --> 43:07.498
( groans )

43:09.171 --> 43:10.752
( screams )

43:14.342 --> 43:17.084
(screaming )

43:20.390 --> 43:23.052
- ( snarling)
- ( Glenn screaming)

43:43.371 --> 43:45.157
Rick.

43:46.875 --> 43:48.831
You ready?

43:56.426 --> 43:59.042
Carol, Daryl,

43:59.221 --> 44:01.052
and me...

44:02.641 --> 44:04.723
we worked it out together.

44:08.104 --> 44:11.346
Carol took three guns
from the armory.

44:11.525 --> 44:14.141
I still have one,
she still has one.

44:17.447 --> 44:21.781
We lied to you because I wasn't sure
how you'd take it,

44:21.952 --> 44:23.738
what you'd do.

44:28.250 --> 44:29.615
( jacket rustles )

44:29.793 --> 44:31.875
You think I'd try to stop you?

44:36.132 --> 44:38.384
Well, you did hit me
over the head.

44:38.552 --> 44:42.295
That was for you, not them.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.895
l was afraid
you'd talk me out of it.

44:54.317 --> 44:56.023
You could've.

44:57.904 --> 45:00.566
We don't need them here.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.446
I don't need my sword.

45:04.870 --> 45:07.156
I think you can find a way.

45:07.330 --> 45:10.743
We can find a way.

45:12.919 --> 45:14.625
And if we don't...

45:17.173 --> 45:19.084
I'm still with you.

45:25.181 --> 45:27.046
Something's gonna happen.

45:28.351 --> 45:31.434
Just don't make
something happen.

45:45.702 --> 45:47.283
Don't be too long.

46:02.135 --> 46:03.671
Bob's voice: You're gonna find
yourself in a place

46:03.845 --> 46:05.710
where it's like how it used to be.

46:05.889 --> 46:08.346
And if you let too much go
along the way,

46:08.516 --> 46:10.507
that's not gonna work.

46:12.228 --> 46:14.890
'Cause you're gonna be back
in the real world.

46:15.065 --> 46:18.899
Rick's voice:
This is the real world, Bob.

46:19.069 --> 46:21.776
Bob's voice:
Nah, this is a nightmare.

46:21.947 --> 46:24.029
And nightmares end.

47:46.406 --> 47:48.237
( door closes)

47:56.916 --> 47:58.747
I came here...

48:03.965 --> 48:06.456
because I don't--
I don't know what to do.

48:07.844 --> 48:09.835
I'm losing my head.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.516
Can you help me?

48:19.355 --> 48:20.856
No.

48:22.150 --> 48:25.563
( people chatting quietly )

48:35.747 --> 48:37.078
We're going to start.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.113
Can we wait?

48:39.292 --> 48:40.748
There's still people coming.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.205
Glenn, Rick.

48:43.379 --> 48:45.461
We're going to start.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.372
It's already dark.

48:48.718 --> 48:50.879
We're going to talk
about what happened.

48:51.054 --> 48:54.512
Not the fight.
Not what precipitated it.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.468
We're dealing with that.

48:56.643 --> 48:59.385
We're going to talk about
one of our constables,

48:59.562 --> 49:02.053
Rick Grimes.

49:02.232 --> 49:06.441
We're going to talk about how he had
a pistol he stole from the armory,

49:06.611 --> 49:08.522
about how he pointed it
at people.

49:08.696 --> 49:11.233
And we're going to talk
about what he said.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.398
lwas hoping he'd be here.

49:13.576 --> 49:15.612
She said he's coming.

49:15.787 --> 49:17.618
I'm sure he'll be here.

49:17.789 --> 49:20.326
And I'm sure we can
work this all out.

49:42.438 --> 49:44.770
( distant dog barking )

49:57.954 --> 50:00.115
lthink I want to die.

50:04.252 --> 50:06.413
Why wouldn't you want to die?

50:08.298 --> 50:10.789
You don't deserve to be here.

50:10.967 --> 50:15.336
What you did
can never be undone.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.255
The dead don't choose,
but the choices you made,

50:18.433 --> 50:20.719
how you sacrificed your own--

50:23.396 --> 50:25.728
I know what you're doing.

50:30.028 --> 50:32.189
Bob was mutilated.

50:33.489 --> 50:35.901
Consumed.

50:36.075 --> 50:38.566
Destroyed because of your sins.

50:38.745 --> 50:39.780
Stop it.

50:39.954 --> 50:41.819
Your brother felt
he was apart from it.

50:41.998 --> 50:43.659
He was a part of it.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.073
He didn't deserve to be here.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.912
- You don't!
- Stop it!

50:47.086 --> 50:48.337
Stop it!

50:48.504 --> 50:50.631
( barking continues)

50:53.676 --> 50:56.008
( panting )

50:56.179 --> 50:58.340
(snarling )

50:59.807 --> 51:03.015
And after being out there

51:03.186 --> 51:06.019
and then not being
how you were out there...

51:07.899 --> 51:09.389
it can drive you crazy.

51:09.567 --> 51:12.684
Rick just wants his family to live.

51:12.862 --> 51:16.025
He wants all of you to live.

51:18.076 --> 51:22.365
Who he is
is who you're gonna be...

51:27.877 --> 51:29.413
if you're lucky.

51:32.257 --> 51:33.667
(grunting)

51:38.930 --> 51:40.340
(grunting)

51:40.515 --> 51:42.221
(silenced gunshot)

51:53.903 --> 51:56.064
(grunts)

51:56.239 --> 52:00.653
Rick Grimes saved my life
over and over.

52:00.827 --> 52:04.240
There's terrifying people
out there.

52:04.414 --> 52:06.826
And he rescued me from them.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.912
People like me,

52:10.086 --> 52:13.078
people like us

52:13.256 --> 52:16.544
need people like him.

52:19.721 --> 52:22.383
I know what happened
last night was scary.

52:23.808 --> 52:26.265
And I'm sure
he's sorry for that.

52:27.937 --> 52:30.644
But maybe we should listen
to what he was saying.

52:34.027 --> 52:36.143
(snarling )

52:58.301 --> 53:00.292
(crunching)

53:06.809 --> 53:09.061
(groaning)

53:15.443 --> 53:17.354
Simply put...

53:19.030 --> 53:21.442
there is a vast ocean of shit

53:21.616 --> 53:24.073
that you people
don't know shit about.

53:25.870 --> 53:29.613
Rick knows every fine grain
of said shit...

53:32.627 --> 53:34.242
and then some.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.209
(snarling )

53:44.555 --> 53:46.295
(gunshot)

53:50.436 --> 53:52.518
- Please don't.
- Shh...

53:52.688 --> 53:55.430
- No.
- They'll hear you.

53:55.608 --> 53:57.769
It'll take longer to reset it.

53:59.028 --> 54:01.110
Just be still.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.566
Just be still.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.408
(gurgling)

54:07.578 --> 54:09.534
Welcome home.

54:15.962 --> 54:18.499
My father respected
Rick Grimes.

54:19.757 --> 54:22.089
Rick is a father, too.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.000
He's a man with a good heart

54:24.178 --> 54:28.012
who feels the things he does,

54:28.182 --> 54:29.718
the things he has to do.

54:31.185 --> 54:35.394
And all of us who were together
before this place,

54:35.565 --> 54:39.353
no matter when we found
each other, we're family now.

54:41.112 --> 54:43.649
Rick started that.

54:43.823 --> 54:45.563
And you won't stop it.

54:45.741 --> 54:47.777
You can't.

54:47.952 --> 54:50.068
And you don't want to.

54:50.246 --> 54:53.784
This community,
you people...

54:56.002 --> 54:58.084
that family...

55:00.214 --> 55:02.296
you want to be a part of it, too.

55:05.428 --> 55:09.967
Before we hear
from anyone else, |--

55:12.059 --> 55:15.222
I would like to share something
in the spirit of transparency.

55:18.524 --> 55:22.483
Father Gabriel came to see me
the day before yesterday

55:22.653 --> 55:27.522
and he said our new arrivals
can't be trusted,

55:27.700 --> 55:29.907
that they were dangerous,

55:30.077 --> 55:33.786
that they would put themselves
before this community.

55:33.956 --> 55:37.369
And not one day later,

55:37.543 --> 55:42.913
Rick seemed to demonstrate
all the things Father Gabriel said.

55:45.676 --> 55:48.133
I had hoped Gabriel
would be here tonight.

55:48.304 --> 55:50.636
I don't see him here,
Deanna.

55:50.806 --> 55:52.967
So you're just saying
what someone said.

55:55.603 --> 55:56.934
Did you tape him?

55:57.104 --> 55:59.641
- He's not here.
- Neither is Rick.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.645
Excuse me.

56:06.822 --> 56:08.483
(grunts)

56:09.659 --> 56:11.991
Noah died because of you.

56:12.161 --> 56:15.949
And I tried to tell you how it is,
how it has to be

56:16.123 --> 56:17.863
and you try to kill me?

56:18.042 --> 56:20.909
(sobbing )

56:21.087 --> 56:22.952
( gun hammer clicks)

56:28.135 --> 56:30.547
( breathing heavily )

56:32.765 --> 56:34.847
(snarling )

56:35.017 --> 56:38.100
- ( beeps)
-( loud music playing )

56:59.542 --> 57:03.251
| just want to keep
my family safe, you know?

57:03.421 --> 57:05.537
And I don't even know
what that means anymore,

57:05.715 --> 57:09.128
but if it means that
we've got to get rid of--

57:09.302 --> 57:10.758
( footsteps )

57:15.266 --> 57:17.177
( women gasp )

57:22.440 --> 57:25.432
( breathing heavily )

57:27.862 --> 57:29.523
l was scared.
I was scared.

57:29.697 --> 57:31.403
- I don't belong out here.
- Shut up.

57:31.574 --> 57:33.815
(sobbing ) l was scared.
I was just scared.

57:33.993 --> 57:36.735
- Shut up.
- I don't-- I don't belong--

57:36.912 --> 57:39.619
- Shut up!
- ( sobbing)

57:39.790 --> 57:42.907
I don't belong out here.

57:43.085 --> 57:44.495
I don't.

57:46.922 --> 57:48.833
Shut up.

57:50.926 --> 57:52.917
( screams )

57:56.015 --> 57:58.427
( Nicholas sobbing )

58:03.981 --> 58:05.437
Gabriel:
Do it.

58:05.608 --> 58:08.475
( breathing heavily )

58:08.653 --> 58:10.359
( door opens)

58:12.323 --> 58:13.984
Sasha.

58:15.743 --> 58:18.359
(whimpering)

58:29.590 --> 58:31.421
You should let her.

58:38.391 --> 58:40.256
They died.

58:43.896 --> 58:46.228
They all died because of me.

58:59.078 --> 59:00.989
They did.

59:15.302 --> 59:18.089
There wasn't a guard
on the gate.

59:18.264 --> 59:19.800
It was open.

59:19.974 --> 59:21.680
| asked Gabriel to close it.

59:21.851 --> 59:23.432
Go.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.345
I didn't bring it in.

59:29.442 --> 59:32.354
It got inside on its own.

59:34.113 --> 59:37.856
They always will--
the dead and the living,

59:38.033 --> 59:40.490
because we're in here.

59:42.538 --> 59:44.199
And the ones out there...

59:47.585 --> 59:49.246
...they'l| hunt us.

59:53.299 --> 59:55.210
They'll find us.

59:58.012 --> 1:00:00.253
They'll try to use us.

1:00:05.060 --> 1:00:06.971
They'll try to kill us.

1:00:32.338 --> 1:00:35.080
But we'll kill them.

1:00:36.175 --> 1:00:39.167
We'll survive.
I'll show you how.

1:00:42.264 --> 1:00:44.220
You know,
I was thinking--

1:00:48.229 --> 1:00:51.221
l was thinking how many of you
do l have to kill

1:00:51.398 --> 1:00:53.525
to save your lives?

1:00:59.949 --> 1:01:02.190
But I'm not gonna do that.

1:01:04.245 --> 1:01:07.203
You're gonna change.

1:01:11.043 --> 1:01:13.534
I'm not sorry
for what I said last night.

1:01:15.631 --> 1:01:18.589
I'm sorry for not
saying it sooner.

1:01:18.759 --> 1:01:20.966
You're not ready...

1:01:21.971 --> 1:01:23.461
but you have to be.

1:01:23.639 --> 1:01:26.506
Right now,
you have to be.

1:01:29.436 --> 1:01:31.427
Luck runs out.

1:01:33.482 --> 1:01:35.313
( footsteps approaching )

1:01:35.484 --> 1:01:38.351
You're not one of us.
You're not one of us!

1:01:38.529 --> 1:01:39.814
Pete, you don't want
to do this.

1:01:39.989 --> 1:01:41.525
- Get the hell away from me, Reg.
- Pete, just stop.

1:01:41.699 --> 1:01:43.735
- Get away from me.
- Deanna: Reg. Reg.

1:01:43.909 --> 1:01:45.820
( whispers )
Not now.

1:01:45.995 --> 1:01:47.826
- Get away. Get away!
- Pete, stop. Pete--

1:01:47.997 --> 1:01:49.988
( Deanna screams )

1:01:52.710 --> 1:01:56.168
- No, no! Oh, my God! No!
- ( gurgling)

1:01:56.338 --> 1:01:58.294
Deanna: Oh, my love.
My love, my love.

1:01:58.465 --> 1:01:59.671
- This is him!
- Stop!

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:02.675
- This is him!
-( Deanna sobbing ) Oh, God!

1:02:02.845 --> 1:02:06.383
Oh! Oh, my love.
My love, my love.

1:02:06.557 --> 1:02:09.048
(sobbing )
No, my love, no, no.

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:11.217
No, my love.

1:02:11.395 --> 1:02:13.260
No, my love, my love.

1:02:13.439 --> 1:02:15.225
Pete:
lt's him!

1:02:15.399 --> 1:02:17.606
This is him!

1:02:22.990 --> 1:02:24.400
Rick...

1:02:28.954 --> 1:02:30.364
do it.

1:02:32.041 --> 1:02:33.906
- ( gunshot )
- ( women scream )

1:02:37.713 --> 1:02:39.249
Morgan:
Rick?

1:02:54.063 --> 1:02:57.021
(theme music playing )

1:04:11.098 --> 1:04:14.932
(snarling )

1:04:18.814 --> 1:04:21.476
( cans rattling )
