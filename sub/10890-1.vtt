00:34.243 --> 00:36.285
You know, high school to college,

00:36.286 --> 00:37.578
it can be a big transition,

00:37.579 --> 00:39.580
especially if you're not from the city,

00:39.581 --> 00:42.250
so... so we try to help
out with that transition

00:42.251 --> 00:43.751
in a number of ways.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.419
That's a real accomplishment.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.754
Congratulations.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.923
I mean, you're not in yet, but...

00:48.924 --> 00:50.383
no, things are looking pretty good.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.635
We do an all-campus
picnic, which is a nice way

00:52.636 --> 00:56.806
for the incoming
students to acclimate themselves

00:56.807 --> 00:58.349
to the college.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.269
For me, the most exciting thing
about this place is the classes.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.937
So you don't want to go to college?

01:02.938 --> 01:06.357
You know, I'm not up to
date on the course catalog.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.611
One of the great things about
this school is, you know,

01:10.612 --> 01:13.030
you have a campus called New York City.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.949
Greatest city in the world, they say.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.285
I thought your essay was...
was interesting.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.870
A spell-check might be
nice on these essays.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.455
Planning on taking your boards again?

01:21.456 --> 01:22.873
Love those extracurriculars.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.459
Have you heard about the meal plan?

01:25.460 --> 01:26.877
Fantastic.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.462
Where do you see things going, you know,

01:28.463 --> 01:30.590
after... after college?

You can have it if you want, though.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.463
Is that a new shirt?

03:34.464 --> 03:36.507
Yeah, it is.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.758
Do you like it?

03:37.759 --> 03:39.176
Don't ask me that.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.428
Why?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.846
Because it's not my job

03:41.847 --> 03:44.306
to make you feel good
about yourself anymore.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.580
Jesse Fisher?

04:49.581 --> 04:50.664
Yeah?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.999
It's your favorite Communist.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.375
Professor Peter Hoberg?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.211
Screw you. I'm not a Communist.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.337
How you doing?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.838
Oh, you know.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.883
Listen, I don't want to take
up too much of your time,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.176
but here's why I'm calling.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.011
Ever since I announced that
I was packing it in,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.222
it's funny, but this whole
place has finally decided

05:06.223 --> 05:07.890
that they don't really hate me after all.

05:07.891 --> 05:10.601
Now, I know Ohio is not
as glamorous as New York,

05:10.602 --> 05:12.937
but they're throwing me
a retirement dinner thing

05:12.938 --> 05:14.230
at the end of the month,

05:14.231 --> 05:16.565
and they asked me to
invite any former students

05:16.566 --> 05:18.859
that might want to lie and
say some nice things about me.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.570
And since you're one of the
great liars that I know...

05:21.571 --> 05:22.738
When is it?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.864
Weekend of the 25th.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.616
You know, check your schedule.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.618
Okay.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.412
Checking now.

05:30.413 --> 05:37.169
Looks like I'd have to
shift some things around, but yeah.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.338
I'll be there.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.582
Hi.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.043
Look at this.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.920
How are you?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.091
- Jesse.
- Yeah, hi.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.718
Hi, I'm David. This is Susan.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.844
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.304
Peter warned you that we'd be here?

07:10.305 --> 07:11.305
He did. He did, yeah.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.725
We're making him take
care of us while we're here.

07:14.726 --> 07:15.976
How was your drive?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.686
It was good, yeah. Pleasant, actually.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.396
Peter, Jesse's here!

07:19.397 --> 07:20.606
So it's good to be back?

07:20.607 --> 07:21.857
Yeah. Yeah, it's weird.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.983
I drove up the hill.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.401
I suddenly felt like I was seeing

07:24.402 --> 07:25.736
an ex-girlfriend or something.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.030
- The one that got away.
- Exactly.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.782
Zibby loves it here so much,

07:29.783 --> 07:31.158
she gets sad to come home on breaks.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.242
Zibby?

07:32.243 --> 07:33.661
Sorry. Elizabeth, our daughter.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.787
She's a sophomore.

07:34.788 --> 07:35.871
She's in the improv group.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.331
We came up to see one of her shows.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.958
- How was it?
- Hilarious.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.460
Filthy but hilarious.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.962
So how do you guys know Peter?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.713
He was my camp counselor.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.215
No way.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.426
He made us sing pro-union
songs around the campfire.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.512
<i>♪ You must stand up for your brother ♪</i>

07:51.513 --> 07:54.014
<i>♪ So you won't die for the man ♪</i>

07:54.015 --> 07:56.725
<i>♪ Stand up for your
brother so you won't die for... ♪</i>

07:56.726 --> 07:58.519
He never writes. He never calls.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.270
Oh, hey.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.022
Let me look at you.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.524
Not bad.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.234
Who's hungry?

08:05.235 --> 08:06.944
- I'm hungry.
- Okay, let's go.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.362
We've got reservations.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.324
Oh, man, 37 years.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.701
Can you believe it?

08:13.702 --> 08:18.163
Native New Yorker spends
37 years in a county

08:18.164 --> 08:20.499
where the tallest building's nine stories.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.377
Oh, my.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.212
How are you feeling about it all?

08:25.213 --> 08:26.338
- The retirement?
- Yeah.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.132
Oh, I don't know.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.009
Another year of faculty meetings,

08:30.010 --> 08:33.220
I'd throw myself off
that nine-story building.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.433
So how's the admissions game, buddy?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.227
"How's the admissions game, buddy?"

08:41.438 --> 08:43.022
Is that Professor Fairfield?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.063
Yeah.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.066
She looks fantastic!

08:46.067 --> 08:47.443
Professor!

08:47.444 --> 08:49.361
What is she like? Is she cool?

08:49.362 --> 08:50.946
She's definitely not warm.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.116
I loved her British Romantic lit class.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.452
She was, like, the best teacher I had here.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.663
She was, like, the second
best teacher I had here.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.250
Unbelievable.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.960
You are unbelievable.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.170
What?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.264
Tell her how you feel.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.766
I will.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.478
Jesse, this is my daughter, Zibby.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.562
Hey.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.439
Hi. Hello.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.899
Peter, should we follow you?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.650
If you think that's wise.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.240
And he's like, "I had it
up to here with America"

09:35.241 --> 09:37.409
and its repressive,
regressive, fascist", whatever.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.952
I sound like that? That's how I sound?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.120
You do. You sound like that.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.497
And he gets up in front of the class.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.290
He says, "I just... I
couldn't take it anymore",

09:43.291 --> 09:47.294
so I picked up my
life, and I moved to France".

09:47.295 --> 09:49.463
This is being ludicrously
misreported, by the way.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.798
So I raised my hand.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.633
I said, "Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, Peter."

09:52.634 --> 09:55.427
You're telling us you
got so angry at this country

09:55.428 --> 09:58.305
"that you moved to France?"

09:58.306 --> 10:01.141
And Peter says, "Yeah."

10:01.142 --> 10:02.267
Well, I had a Fulbright".

10:03.978 --> 10:05.312
Yeah, well, yeah, if I told you

10:05.313 --> 10:06.939
what this putz was like when he was here,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.148
he'd run out of the room crying.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.399
That's probably true.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.318
Well, what were you like
when you were here?

10:11.319 --> 10:14.530
I was very handsome, wasn't I?

10:14.531 --> 10:15.864
Am I remembering that correctly?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.116
No, I don't remember that.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.326
But what I do remember
is you being a real jerk

10:19.327 --> 10:21.328
to your parents on graduation weekend.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.704
He didn't want to leave.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.956
It's true.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.834
And I blamed my parents,
weirdly, all four of them.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.794
Like it was their fault college was ending.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.920
Don't do that to us.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.089
- No, I won't.
- She says that now.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.467
So your parents told me
you're in the improv group?

10:35.468 --> 10:36.635
Yeah.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.719
How's that?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.471
It's the best. I love it.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.764
What do you love about it?

10:40.765 --> 10:45.352
I think I love how terrifying it is

10:45.353 --> 10:48.689
and how you have to say
"yes" to everything.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.691
Sorry, what does that mean?

10:50.692 --> 10:52.317
It's, like, the only rule of improv.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.610
You can never say "no".

10:53.611 --> 10:56.697
You have to say "yes"
and then add something.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.241
Like... like, look.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.785
Okay, Mom, you and I

11:01.786 --> 11:04.121
have been wandering in the desert for days,

11:04.122 --> 11:06.039
and we're about to die, okay?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.249
Okay.

11:07.250 --> 11:12.254
Okay, and I say, "Hand me that lemonade".

11:14.716 --> 11:17.050
So hand me that lemonade.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.097
Jesus, Susan, hand her
the goddamn lemonade.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.223
Never mind.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.059
Jesse, hand me that lemonade.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.979
Thank you.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.567
Sweet, just the way I like it.

11:33.568 --> 11:34.902
I nailed this.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.240
It doesn't make sense.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.575
We're in the desert.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.036
I mean, where would we get lemonade?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.207
It's great seeing you guys.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.583
So what was your major?

11:49.584 --> 11:52.044
I was English with a minor in history,

11:52.045 --> 11:53.962
just to make sure I was fully unemployable.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.422
- Right.
- What about you?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.506
Drama.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.925
I mean, not officially yet,

11:57.926 --> 12:00.010
'cause my dad's not
totally thrilled with the idea,

12:00.011 --> 12:02.763
so maybe also art history?

12:02.764 --> 12:04.932
I'm just happy you go
to class occasionally.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.017
I thought maybe you
just improvised all day long.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.435
Nope.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.811
I mean, I do, I guess.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.230
Have you ever thought about that?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.397
About what?

12:12.398 --> 12:15.025
How everything in life is
basically improvised?

12:15.026 --> 12:16.318
There's no script.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.363
We're just making this up as we go.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.697
That's true.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.823
So yeah.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.243
Well, improv is deep, man.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.702
Well, we're about to head out.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.788
- Pleasure to meet you, Jesse.
- Yeah, yeah, you too.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.081
Take care. Bye.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.666
So I'll... I'll see you around, I guess.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.751
- Yeah, yeah, see you around.
- Okay.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.877
It was nice to meet you.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.462
Yeah, you too.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.714
- See you later.
- Okay, bye.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.262
Enjoy college.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.604
You wearing a tie tonight?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.694
What can you say, really?

13:00.405 --> 13:03.573
People get up and say all
this great stuff about you.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.992
You know, I'm thinking,

13:04.993 --> 13:06.827
"Who in the hell are they talking about?"

13:14.002 --> 13:16.795
It's just, where does the time go?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.005
This seems impossible.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.423
37 years.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.758
37.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.345
There comes a time in a man's life

13:25.346 --> 13:27.639
when it hurts to do the math.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.191
You know, I worry that
I've been here so long

13:38.192 --> 13:42.029
that I'll be lousy being anyplace else.

13:43.364 --> 13:47.701
Oh, well, I guess I'll
find out very shortly.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.799
Hey, thanks for the chicken.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.053
It was a little cold, but still I...

14:08.139 --> 14:10.974
Think nice thoughts about me when I'm gone,

14:10.975 --> 14:13.352
if you can.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.027
No, they did it at Macalester.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.403
I really think it could work here.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.821
Well, it sounds great.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.324
I tell you, let's talk about it on Monday.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.493
Oh, sure.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.786
Night, Jesse.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.412
Yeah, good night.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.916
It's a good idea, though.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.544
It's a terrible idea.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.008
Oh, what a disaster.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.511
What... no, it was nice.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.013
You're not half the liar you used to be.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.936
You know, it really means a lot to me

14:55.937 --> 14:57.145
that you came out for this.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.438
How could I miss it?

14:58.439 --> 15:00.148
You're the second best teacher I had here.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.359
I'm serious.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.448
I'm gonna take off.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.616
Well, I'll come with you.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.451
Oh, no, no, no, you stay.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.578
I want to be alone for a bit.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.232
I feel you, man.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.485
A lot of information in trees.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.325
How's your night going?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.410
Fine.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.663
Is your name...

15:56.664 --> 15:58.790
Ethan?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.334
No. Why?

16:01.335 --> 16:02.836
You look like an Ethan to me.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.671
My name's not Ethan.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.840
How cool would that have
been if that was your name

16:06.841 --> 16:08.383
and I just, like...

16:08.384 --> 16:11.011
Knew it?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.721
Are you a student here?

16:12.722 --> 16:15.724
No, but thank you for thinking that.

16:15.725 --> 16:16.808
You?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.059
Nah, man.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.187
I'm just here visiting a buddy of mine.

16:20.188 --> 16:23.732
But it's not a bad place to
kill a little time?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.567
I'm Nat.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.694
I'm Jesse.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.030
Do you hear that music, Ethan?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.657
It sounds like a celebration.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.910
I say we do a little sherlocking,

16:34.911 --> 16:37.120
find out where it's coming
from and what's going on.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.539
- No...
- Don't say no.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.000
Fortune never smiles on those who say no.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.050
<i>♪ Everybody get on the floor ♪</i>

16:50.051 --> 16:52.219
<i>♪ Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh ♪</i>

16:52.220 --> 16:54.721
<i>♪ Everybody get on the floor ♪</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:56.681
<i>♪ Everybody wanna uh-uh-uh ♪</i>

16:56.682 --> 16:58.183
<i>♪ Everybody get... ♪</i>

16:58.184 --> 17:01.436
I would get you a beer,
but alcohol's for suckers, man.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.812
Yeah.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.897
Listen, Nat, this isn't
really my scene anymore.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.358
I'm gonna...

17:06.358 --> 17:08.484
Give yourself five minutes
to adapt, my brother.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.904
Change is never easy.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.082
Tell me this.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.252
What are your thoughts on crop circles?

17:25.252 --> 17:27.337
I don't have any.

17:27.338 --> 17:31.132
There's some seriously
weird shit going on, bro.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.134
You think it's just a
bunch of drunk English guys

17:33.135 --> 17:34.469
with planks and rope?

17:34.470 --> 17:36.304
You're a fool.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.224
Spend some time with those patterns.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.101
You can feel it.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.271
Something's trying to communicate with us.

17:44.272 --> 17:48.692
It should be on the front
page of every paper every day.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.194
Okay. Thanks.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.320
Hey!

17:52.321 --> 17:54.114
I thought that was you.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.283
- Hi.
- How'd you end up here?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.534
He made a friend.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.786
Yeah, yeah, I... yeah.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.204
Look at you.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.790
You're, like, back in college.

18:03.791 --> 18:04.874
Whee!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.167
How does it feel?

18:07.253 --> 18:08.670
Oh, this is Vanessa.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.213
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.464
- I'm Nat.
- Hey.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.507
Jesse's an alum.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.800
We had brunch this morning.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.969
I think my mom has a little crush on him.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.178
You went here?

18:17.179 --> 18:18.221
I did, yeah.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.639
When'd you graduate?

18:19.640 --> 18:22.517
Oh, man, it was the '90s.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.646
That was when we were born.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.773
Yeah, yeah.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.483
I'm old.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.319
But you look good.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.656
And you're overdressed.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.296
<i>♪ Hotter, sweeter, taller... ♪</i>

18:51.297 --> 18:53.048
That's better.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.008
<i>♪ Hotter, sweeter ♪</i>

18:55.009 --> 18:57.427
Why do I like this guy so much?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.512
Because he's likable.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.807
Hey, let's get you guys some drinks.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.101
Yeah, no, I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take off.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.353
No, you should stay.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.521
No, really, I should go.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.899
- Do you drink coffee?
- Yeah.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.859
What? That's crazy.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.986
So does my friend here.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.988
You two, tomorrow.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.823
Shoop! Coffee.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.159
Yeah, I could do that. You want to?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.203
I... yeah... yeah.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.038
That'd be... that's great.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.498
9:00 okay?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.087
Oh, you're serious.

19:32.088 --> 19:35.715
Is 11:30 okay?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.550
Yeah, that works.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.135
Hey.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.345
Hi.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.721
Can we talk?

19:41.722 --> 19:44.015
Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.642
See you tomorrow?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.394
Yeah, yeah. See you then.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.479
Okay.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.232
Hey, Vanessa.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.862
Don't sweat that guy.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.032
She only had eyes for you.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.909
Okay.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.411
Good night, Nat.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.705
Good night, Ethan.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.091
Can I help you?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.426
Sorry.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.136
I just...

21:03.137 --> 21:04.804
just the best book of all time.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.141
I just like holding it, I guess.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.851
Best book of all time?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.352
Well, one of them, sure.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.313
Have you ever noticed
how everyone around here

21:13.314 --> 21:15.273
speaks in wild hyperbole?

21:15.274 --> 21:16.608
Everything's the best.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.818
Like, "He's the best professor ever",

21:18.819 --> 21:21.446
or, "This is the best
patty melt on the planet",

21:21.447 --> 21:23.281
as if they've sampled
every possible variety

21:23.282 --> 21:24.991
of professor and patty melt,

21:24.992 --> 21:28.244
which is, as we know, logistically
impossible.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.959
Okay.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.006
All right, do we have enough time for that?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.178
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.179
Am I super late?

21:46.180 --> 21:47.680
No. You want a coffee?

21:47.681 --> 21:50.683
No, I'll just drink yours.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.101
You okay?

21:52.102 --> 21:54.437
I don't know yet.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.444
I smell like beer. Do you smell that?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.532
Yeah, actually, you do.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.038
I... I need to excuse myself just...

22:12.039 --> 22:14.249
just for a...

22:25.803 --> 22:27.720
Sorry about that.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.931
Back there.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.724
You walked away, and I was just wondering

22:31.725 --> 22:36.145
why I was being rude to
someone who loves the same writer I do.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.232
And I don't have an answer for that.

22:39.233 --> 22:40.316
Okay.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.736
Okay, so yeah...

22:43.737 --> 22:44.863
I'll just...

22:44.864 --> 22:47.323
My grades tanked senior year.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.076
That book was the only
thing I wanted to read.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.369
You liking it?

22:51.370 --> 22:54.622
Yeah.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.499
It's my second time reading it, actually.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.710
That's impressive.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.836
It's not short.

22:59.837 --> 23:01.045
Yeah, I know.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.672
You know, he said the purpose of fiction

23:02.673 --> 23:04.257
was to combat loneliness.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.925
That's good.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.302
I never heard that.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.386
Yeah.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.929
Well, on the other hand,

23:09.930 --> 23:12.140
spending most of your
time with an 1,100-page book

23:12.141 --> 23:14.100
tends to put a dent in your social life.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.185
Yeah.

23:16.186 --> 23:20.690
Loneliness
simultaneously increased and decreased.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.525
Hey.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.485
What, you guys know each other?

23:24.486 --> 23:27.280
Yeah, we had Symbolic Logic first semester.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.781
Zibby.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.867
Right. Dean, hi.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.619
- Hey.
- I'm Jesse, by the way.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.120
Okay.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.626
Interesting guy.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.793
Yeah.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.004
I can't believe he's even back here.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.797
Why? What do you mean?

23:44.798 --> 23:47.634
He had a manic episode last year.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.928
Eventually, they took him to a hospital

23:49.929 --> 23:52.805
and, I don't know, calmed
him down, I guess.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.974
He's supposed to be,
like, the smartest guy ever.

23:57.478 --> 23:58.645
Everything okay?

23:58.646 --> 24:01.105
Yeah, everything's great.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.607
I puked.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.151
That's gross.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.611
Sorry, you did not need to hear that.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.571
Come on, let's... let's walk.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.619
My parents really liked you.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.912
That's nice.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.039
I like them.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.583
You're really lucky to
have parents like that.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.126
Like what?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.836
Like, I don't know.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.005
Around, first of all.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.758
Still together so they can
fret over you as a team.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.343
Yeah, I guess.

24:30.344 --> 24:33.012
I like them best when
they're not being so parental,

24:33.013 --> 24:36.766
which is, like, 1% of the time.

24:36.767 --> 24:39.435
Oh, I thought of this great trick

24:39.436 --> 24:40.687
for having them annoy me less.

24:40.688 --> 24:41.854
- Want to hear it?
- Okay.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.690
Okay, I decided to treat my parents

24:43.691 --> 24:45.149
like they're always drunk.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.110
No, really, it works.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.737
Any time they say
something irritating or offensive,

24:49.738 --> 24:52.365
I'm just like, "Oh, I
can't get mad at them."

24:52.366 --> 24:54.367
They're drunk. It's not their fault".

24:54.368 --> 24:56.619
And why should I take advice
from drunk people seriously?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.538
That's great.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.456
Do you like classical music?

25:00.457 --> 25:02.041
Yeah, sure.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.211
Okay, I took this music
survey class last year.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.046
Oh, my God!

25:07.047 --> 25:09.007
It totally changed my life.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.971
I'm really happy I ran into you last night.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.764
Yeah, yeah, me too.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.725
It's random.

25:20.394 --> 25:23.187
Who was that guy?

25:23.188 --> 25:24.731
What guy?

25:24.732 --> 25:26.274
The... last night, that guy.

25:26.275 --> 25:31.237
Oh, his name is Eric.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.489
Eric.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.075
Is Eric your fella?

25:36.076 --> 25:39.037
No.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.290
No.

25:42.291 --> 25:46.836
You know, I think I like
almost everything about this place

25:46.837 --> 25:49.630
but the dude situation.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.049
Not great?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.759
No one, like, dates.

25:52.760 --> 25:57.388
Everyone's so casual about it all.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.766
Same as when I was here.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.894
Yeah.

26:02.895 --> 26:07.440
I guess there's part of me that's
a little old-fashioned.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.989
Well, on behalf

26:14.990 --> 26:19.619
of all current and
former 18- to 22-year-olds,

26:19.620 --> 26:22.288
I'd like to apologize.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.040
Forgive us.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.875
Seriously.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.795
We know not what we do.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.134
I think one of the things

26:35.135 --> 26:37.345
I loved the most about being here

26:37.346 --> 26:40.056
was the feeling that anything was possible.

26:40.057 --> 26:43.309
It's just infinite choices ahead of you.

26:43.310 --> 26:47.271
You'd get out of school,
and anything could happen.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.691
And then you do get out, and...

26:50.692 --> 26:51.943
life happens, you know?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.402
Decisions get made.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.447
And then all those many
choices you had in front of you

26:56.448 --> 26:58.324
are no longer really there.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.909
At a certain point, you just got to go,

26:59.910 --> 27:02.495
"Oh, I guess this is how it's going down".

27:02.496 --> 27:07.166
And there's just something a
little depressing about that.

27:07.167 --> 27:11.462
Well, don't you think you're
romanticizing youth a bit much?

27:11.463 --> 27:14.173
You know, 'cause it's just
as hard and annoying

27:14.174 --> 27:17.718
to be young as it is to
be old, I'm assuming.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.138
Not that you're old, 'cause,
you know, you're not.

27:20.139 --> 27:24.684
Look, I get the whole "we're
all equal" argument,

27:24.685 --> 27:27.436
and it's kind of true, but
it's also kind of not true.

27:27.437 --> 27:32.358
Like, okay, I feel different
now than I felt when I was here,

27:32.359 --> 27:36.320
and I hate to break this
to you, but so will you.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.197
So you're saying things suck?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.283
I should prepare myself for suckiness?

27:40.284 --> 27:43.619
No, a liberal arts education
solves all your problems.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.954
Thank God!

27:44.955 --> 27:46.372
Worth every penny.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.004
We should hug.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.422
What?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.299
I mean, we could keep talking,

27:56.300 --> 28:01.304
but I think it would be
better if we hugged.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.514
Come on.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.891
Okay.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.395
- Who starts?
- I do.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.730
- Okay.
- Here we go.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.786
God, so you were here a long time ago.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.330
Okay.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.540
- I mean...
- Enough, enough.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.088
That's... I mean, I just
mean because I thought,

28:36.089 --> 28:38.174
with the greenhouses...

28:38.175 --> 28:42.428
Hey, before you go, I thought
you might like these,

28:42.429 --> 28:44.847
'cause I don't really need
'em anymore and here.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.642
Look at this one.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.979
No?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.314
Nah.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.774
Oh, please, that's a great shirt.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.692
You know the trouble I
caused in this shirt?

28:56.693 --> 28:57.902
I can only imagine.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.112
You got no taste on top of everything else.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.989
Oh, my God, what a beautiful shirt.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.616
- Not giving it to you anyway.
- All right.

29:03.617 --> 29:04.784
Oh, it feels great!

29:09.331 --> 29:10.957
Hello?

29:10.958 --> 29:13.251
Oh, hi.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.796
No, no, he's... he's still here.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.005
Yeah, hold on.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.802
Zibby.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.429
Hello?

29:25.430 --> 29:26.597
You haven't left yet.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.974
- No.
- Good.

29:27.975 --> 29:30.476
I need to see you before you go.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.645
Will you meet me at the bookstore?

29:34.481 --> 29:35.564
Say yes.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.150
Yes.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.403
Okay.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.154
She's asking about a book I recommended.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.365
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.783
Be a gentleman. Walk me to my car.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.159
All right, all right.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.328
Thanks for the shirts.
I'll get them next time, okay?

29:49.329 --> 29:51.372
Yeah, you'll be on the road,
and you'll be saying,

29:51.373 --> 29:52.533
"Oh, maybe I'll call him up".

29:59.965 --> 30:01.590
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.509
Sorry, I don't want to
hold you up or anything,

30:03.510 --> 30:05.636
but I...

30:05.637 --> 30:06.929
I made this for you.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.098
Burned it, whatever.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.350
It's music from the survey class

30:11.351 --> 30:12.518
I was telling you about.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.021
Classical, baroque, opera.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.482
This is great.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.234
I know none of this.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.403
Who says we always have to be listening

30:22.404 --> 30:23.821
to obscure indie bands, right?

30:23.822 --> 30:25.364
Right.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.575
So yeah, I don't know.

30:27.576 --> 30:31.704
This is all music I never thought
I'd like or care about,

30:31.705 --> 30:33.706
and this class just...

30:33.707 --> 30:36.167
well, you know how you can
be told something so many times

30:36.168 --> 30:38.127
and it's like, "Whatever",

30:38.128 --> 30:39.712
and then you have a great teacher

30:39.713 --> 30:40.963
take you through it,

30:40.964 --> 30:46.010
and suddenly it's like, "Beethoven, whoa".

30:46.011 --> 30:47.970
Yeah.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.472
This is really great. Thank you.

30:49.473 --> 30:53.142
I wish I had come with something for you.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.520
Well, you know what you could do?

30:56.521 --> 31:00.441
You could write me a letter.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.567
I could do that.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.902
Handwritten, I mean,

31:02.903 --> 31:04.278
like with a pen or something.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.822
Yeah, paper.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.075
Maybe seal it with some red wax.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.826
I could listen to this while I'm writing.

31:10.827 --> 31:13.454
Right, it'll be like full-on 17th century.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.664
Right, right.

31:15.665 --> 31:18.125
So I don't have your address.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.710
Oh, 108 is my P.O. Box,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.253
and you can figure out the rest, right?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.671
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:22.672 --> 31:27.176
I also... I put my number
on the inside of the case.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.969
Yes, you did.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.596
You know, in case you ever...

31:30.597 --> 31:31.680
whatever.

31:31.681 --> 31:34.475
Yeah, right.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.643
Okay.

31:35.644 --> 31:39.313
- Well...
- Well...

31:39.314 --> 31:40.439
Yeah.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.941
- Bye.
- Bye.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.120
Professor Fairfield.

31:54.121 --> 31:57.039
Jesse Fisher.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.041
I...

31:59.042 --> 32:01.127
I took your British
Romantic literature class

32:01.128 --> 32:04.422
when I was here as a student.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.299
And?

32:07.300 --> 32:12.471
And I loved it.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.439
Great.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.159
Hey, Dean.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.996
I know it's bad for you.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.374
Just quit when you graduate,
like everyone else.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.042
Sweet ride.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.502
You jerk.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.171
It's a rental.

32:45.172 --> 32:48.507
I'm not the best at flying.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.717
I can understand that.

32:49.718 --> 32:50.759
Where you headed?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.969
Back to my dorm.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.180
Get in. I'll give you a lift.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.942
So you went here, right?

33:06.943 --> 33:08.027
I did.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.069
You liked it?

33:09.070 --> 33:10.696
A lot.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.865
I mean, you block out the bad memories...

33:12.866 --> 33:15.826
writing a senior thesis, February.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.578
Yeah, February here sucks.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.246
Yeah, it's horrible.

33:19.247 --> 33:24.043
So other than February, things
are good for you here?

33:24.044 --> 33:27.296
I wouldn't say that.

33:27.297 --> 33:31.884
You want to... you can
tell me about it if you want.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.556
Well it's not exactly a secret.

33:37.557 --> 33:44.063
Last year, I kind of lost my mind a bit.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.564
I don't really remember much of it,

33:45.565 --> 33:50.361
but apparently I got up to
some pretty amusing antics.

33:50.362 --> 33:55.241
So now they've got me on
this pretty heavy stuff,

33:55.242 --> 33:58.244
which I guess allows me to function,

33:58.245 --> 34:01.747
but it also makes
everything seem underwater,

34:01.748 --> 34:04.792
which is not as pleasant as it sounds.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.503
Why'd you come back?

34:07.504 --> 34:10.797
My mom's a nurse.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.967
She raised me on her own.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.427
I got a full ride.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.973
She's...

34:18.974 --> 34:21.266
so proud I'm here.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.984
Thanks for the lift.

35:43.016 --> 35:45.851
<i>"Dear Zibby, I can't thank you enough"</i>

35:45.852 --> 35:48.729
<i>for introducing me to this music.</i>

35:48.730 --> 35:50.397
<i>Beyond just genuinely loving it,</i>

35:50.398 --> 35:53.651
<i>I feel it's quietly altering
my feeling about New York City,</i>

35:53.652 --> 35:55.110
<i>with which I've always had</i>

35:55.111 --> 35:57.404
<i>a slightly conflicted relationship.</i>

35:57.405 --> 36:00.074
<i>I've found that if you
replace the horns and the shouting</i>

36:00.075 --> 36:02.993
<i>with, say, Schubert or Telemann,</i>

36:02.994 --> 36:05.788
<i>the city becomes unbearably beautiful.</i>

36:05.789 --> 36:09.208
<i>After years of thinly
disguised rage on both our parts,</i>

36:09.209 --> 36:12.878
<i>it's like the music has mediated
a truce between us.</i>

36:12.879 --> 36:14.838
<i>Some early favorites.</i>

36:14.839 --> 36:16.799
<i>Massenet's Meditation.</i>

36:16.800 --> 36:19.259
<i>If a more beautiful piece of
music has ever been composed,</i>

36:19.260 --> 36:20.886
<i>I don't know it.</i>

36:20.887 --> 36:23.555
<i>That Brandenburg concerto is no joke,</i>

36:23.556 --> 36:26.809
<i>and I echo your
sentiment regarding Beethoven.</i>

36:28.478 --> 36:29.937
<i>I have no idea</i>

36:29.938 --> 36:33.232
<i>what the Vivaldi piece from
Giustino is actually about,</i>

36:33.233 --> 36:36.235
<i>but to me, it suggests deception,</i>

36:36.236 --> 36:39.363
<i>some kind of elegant double-crossing.</i>

36:42.992 --> 36:45.369
<i>It makes me feel like I'm a double agent</i>

36:45.370 --> 36:48.706
<i>knee deep in some kind of sexy espionage.</i>

36:55.130 --> 36:57.715
<i>I've decided the
Wagner overture you included</i>

36:57.716 --> 36:59.550
<i>should come with a warning label.</i>

36:59.551 --> 37:01.760
<i>According to some quick online research,</i>

37:01.761 --> 37:03.220
<i>the opera deals with the struggle</i>

37:03.221 --> 37:05.472
<i>between sacred and profane love,</i>

37:05.473 --> 37:09.518
<i>which is arguably the
only struggle there is.</i>

37:09.519 --> 37:11.979
<i>The other day, I was crossing the street,</i>

37:11.980 --> 37:13.480
<i>lost in my head about something,</i>

37:13.481 --> 37:16.191
<i>a not uncommon state of affairs.</i>

37:16.192 --> 37:17.901
<i>I was listening to the overture,</i>

37:17.902 --> 37:19.653
<i>and as the music began to swell,</i>

37:19.654 --> 37:26.535
<i>I suddenly realized that I
had hands and legs and a torso</i>

37:26.536 --> 37:29.413
<i>and that I was
surrounded by people and cars.</i>

37:48.558 --> 37:51.226
<i>It's hard to explain exactly what happened.</i>

37:51.227 --> 37:54.271
<i>But I felt in that moment that the divine,</i>

37:54.272 --> 37:57.608
<i>however we may choose
to define such a thing,</i>

37:57.609 --> 38:00.611
<i>surely dwells as much in
the concrete and taxicabs</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:03.572
<i>as it does in the
rivers, lakes, and mountains.</i>

38:03.573 --> 38:08.243
<i>Grace, I realized, is
neither time-nor place-dependent.</i>

38:08.244 --> 38:11.205
<i>All we need is the right soundtrack.</i>

38:11.206 --> 38:14.166
<i>I suppose this new
infusion of music in my life is,</i>

38:14.167 --> 38:16.418
<i>at the very least, making me reconsider</i>

38:16.419 --> 38:18.295
<i>"my hostility to dead, white males".</i>

38:19.464 --> 38:21.507
<i>"And I've you to thank for that."</i>

38:21.508 --> 38:23.550
<i>How's things, by the way?</i>

38:23.551 --> 38:27.596
<i>"Your friend, Jesse Fisher".</i>

38:27.597 --> 38:31.225
<i>Jesse, things is good.</i>

38:31.226 --> 38:33.685
<i>So happy you're loving the music.</i>

38:33.686 --> 38:35.771
<i>I felt my whole life got an upgrade</i>

38:35.772 --> 38:37.523
<i>when I took that class.</i>

38:37.524 --> 38:39.316
<i>The thing that floors me most</i>

38:39.317 --> 38:42.694
<i>is that human beings wrote that music.</i>

38:42.695 --> 38:45.656
<i>Are people writing

38:52.247 --> 38:55.541

listen to it, for some reason,</i>

38:55.542 --> 38:59.461

more attractive.</i>

<i>It somehow made
everyone in New York look like</i>

39:40.336 --> 39:42.754
<i>a viable romantic partner.</i>

39:45.091 --> 39:47.593
<i>I can't escape it any longer.</i>

39:47.594 --> 39:50.512
<i>I think I like opera.</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:19.458
<i>If I haven't been
clear about this, I miss you.</i>

40:19.459 --> 40:22.711
<i>Don't really know why.</i>

40:22.712 --> 40:25.422
<i>I barely know you.</i>

40:25.423 --> 40:28.342
<i>By the way, handwritten letters?</i>

40:28.343 --> 40:29.635
<i>Greatest thing in the world.</i>

this isn't being written today."</i>

<i>"I bet if we went here at the same time,</i>

40:58.831 --> 41:00.916
<i>"Will this music be the death of me?"</i>

41:00.917 --> 41:04.962
<i>If so, you'll have
blood on your hands, Elizabeth.</i>

41:04.963 --> 41:07.172

41:17.183 --> 41:21.103
<i>So come back here and see me.</i>

<i>I'd like a gentleman
caller, and I'd like him to be you.</i>

41:32.281 --> 41:35.492

<i>"Dear Elizabeth, I've
decided to take you up on your offer."</i>

43:02.663 --> 43:05.791
<i>I'll be getting in on the
14th and staying at the inn,</i>

43:05.792 --> 43:09.961
<i>but I will be available for
walks, strolls, saunters,</i>

43:09.962 --> 43:11.880
<i>ambles, and promenades.</i>

43:11.881 --> 43:13.465
<i>Looking forward to it.</i>

43:13.466 --> 43:14.966
<i>"Jesse Fisher".</i>

43:23.976 --> 43:25.477
Hey.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.581
So, Bob...

43:46.582 --> 43:50.669
I've been asking myself a
lot of tough questions lately.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.754
Everybody knows I made a whole stink

43:52.755 --> 43:54.965
about leaving this
place, you know, how it's time...

43:54.966 --> 43:56.049
How if you'd look back,

43:56.050 --> 43:58.426
you'd turn into a pillar of salt.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.262
Yeah, all that. That's...

44:02.974 --> 44:06.226
I think I may have spoken too soon.

44:09.021 --> 44:12.274
I think... I think I still
got a little gas in the tank is all.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.692
I just...

44:13.693 --> 44:16.403
Well, Peter, you have no bigger
fan around here than me.

44:16.404 --> 44:18.780
Thank you.

44:18.781 --> 44:22.200
When you announced your
plans, we were all sad to see you go,

44:22.201 --> 44:23.702
but you insisted that it was time.

44:23.703 --> 44:26.288
Right, which I thought it was.

44:26.289 --> 44:29.374
We hired someone,

44:29.375 --> 44:31.668
young guy out of UVA.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.087
Very impressive candidate.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.381
He was our first choice, actually.

44:36.382 --> 44:39.384
We didn't think we would
get him, but we did.

44:39.385 --> 44:42.888
You said you wanted nothing
to do with the search.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.432
Right, right. No, I...

44:45.433 --> 44:48.560
I just...

44:48.561 --> 44:50.687
I just didn't think it would move so fast.

44:50.688 --> 44:54.649
Well, there was unanimous
enthusiasm for the candidate,

44:54.650 --> 44:58.278
so things just moved
along faster than normal.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.407
Bob.

45:02.408 --> 45:03.533
Give me this one.

45:03.534 --> 45:07.495
Peter, we can't.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.456
The department has spent
thousands of dollars

45:09.457 --> 45:10.582
on this search.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.334
He's turned down other offers.

45:12.335 --> 45:14.252
You know what goes into this sort of thing.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.297
I hired you, Bob.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.424
You don't have to tell me how this w...

45:21.385 --> 45:23.136
And let me tell you,

45:23.137 --> 45:27.432
there was not unanimous enthusiasm
for you back then.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.100
It took a lot of arm-twisting on my part

45:29.101 --> 45:31.519
to get people to come around.

45:31.520 --> 45:35.774
And now, 20 years later, the only reason

45:35.775 --> 45:37.943
that you're the chairman
of this goddamn department

45:37.944 --> 45:39.611
is 'cause I loathe politics!

45:39.612 --> 45:43.156
And you, for reasons which
I cannot fathom, do not.

45:45.493 --> 45:49.371
In fact, you seem to
have a real taste for it.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.969
I'm asking...

46:07.640 --> 46:09.391
I'm asking a favor.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.642
Listen.

46:10.643 --> 46:13.853
Just give me this one, Bob, okay?

46:13.854 --> 46:16.231
I need three more years.

46:19.151 --> 46:21.820
I'm sorry.

46:21.821 --> 46:23.989
There's nothing I can do.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.502
Hey.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.796
Hi.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.006
Oh, hey.

46:41.007 --> 46:42.590
Jesse, you remember Vanessa, right?

46:42.591 --> 46:45.343
- Yeah, hi.
- You're back.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.469
Yeah.

46:49.557 --> 46:51.599
So I should...

46:51.600 --> 46:55.603
yeah, I got some stuff to do.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.944
So this is your room.

47:02.945 --> 47:04.070
Yeah. Fancy?

47:04.071 --> 47:05.196
Yeah.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.157
Forgot how small these are.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.742
Good training for living in New York.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.912
So are you gonna see Professor Hoberg

47:12.913 --> 47:14.706
while you're here?

47:14.707 --> 47:16.374
You know, probably not.

47:17.793 --> 47:20.462
And, you know, if you...
if you run into him,

47:20.463 --> 47:22.213
maybe don't mention that I'm here.

47:22.214 --> 47:26.051
- Okay.
- Okay.

47:26.052 --> 47:29.471
Do you want to sit?

47:29.472 --> 47:31.931
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:38.773 --> 47:40.231
So I should tell you,

47:40.232 --> 47:42.567
I feel a little weird about being here.

47:42.568 --> 47:43.985
Why? Don't.

47:43.986 --> 47:45.904
Well, I don't know if you know this,

47:45.905 --> 47:49.074
but I'm a few years older than you.

47:49.075 --> 47:50.533
You are?

47:50.534 --> 47:52.077
Just a few, yeah,

47:52.078 --> 47:53.787
and I'm not necessarily saying...

47:53.788 --> 47:55.413
I don't want to get ahead of myself here.

47:55.414 --> 47:56.539
It's just...

47:56.540 --> 47:57.874
Oh, wait, sorry.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.920
You... did you think this
was, like, a romantic thing?

48:05.257 --> 48:06.633
Just kidding.

48:07.927 --> 48:09.302
Oh, my...

48:09.303 --> 48:11.429
Come here.

48:18.437 --> 48:21.815
Try not to overthink things, okay?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.274
You're talking to the wrong guy.

48:23.275 --> 48:26.569
Well, look.

48:26.570 --> 48:28.613
We connect really well, don't you think?

48:28.614 --> 48:31.408
We do, yeah.

48:31.409 --> 48:33.743
I just can't figure out if
it's because you're advanced

48:33.744 --> 48:35.829
or because I'm stunted.

48:35.830 --> 48:38.331
It's because I'm advanced.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.125
Maybe.

48:40.126 --> 48:42.669
But I'm also a little stunted.

48:45.965 --> 48:48.842
Look, I want to take things slowly, okay?

48:48.843 --> 48:50.593
Yeah, okay.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.138
Me too. Me too.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.807
But I would like to kiss you

48:55.808 --> 48:57.976
on your forehead.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.020
Can I kiss you on your forehead?

49:02.440 --> 49:03.523
Say yes.

49:03.524 --> 49:05.233
Yes.

49:12.408 --> 49:14.242
And your chin?

49:14.243 --> 49:15.660
May I kiss your chin?

49:34.013 --> 49:35.138
Sorry. Hi, sorry.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.515
Just need to grab something.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.899
Roommates.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.735
Can we... are you hungry?

49:48.736 --> 49:50.028
I could eat.

49:50.029 --> 49:51.362
Yeah?

49:51.363 --> 49:53.990
Maybe we could go into
town and grab something?

49:53.991 --> 49:55.074
That'll take too long.

49:55.075 --> 49:57.243
I have class at 2:00.

49:58.579 --> 50:03.541
But I know a place
that's good and even closer.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.574
Hey, Dean.

50:39.328 --> 50:41.204
You get a job here?

50:41.205 --> 50:42.288
I wish.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.290
Hey, I seem to have lost my friend.

50:44.291 --> 50:45.500
You mind if I...

50:50.005 --> 50:52.131
What are you working on?

50:52.132 --> 50:56.052
Yeah, it's this...

50:56.053 --> 50:57.762
novel.

50:57.763 --> 50:59.097
Good for you.

50:59.098 --> 51:00.181
I guess.

51:00.182 --> 51:01.266
You happy with it?

51:01.267 --> 51:02.433
Not really.

51:06.438 --> 51:07.772
How you been? Any better?

51:07.773 --> 51:10.275
No.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.610
I kind of just wish this would all be over

51:12.611 --> 51:14.070
as soon as possible.

51:17.241 --> 51:20.326
Why did you love it here so much?

51:24.623 --> 51:28.167
It's the only time you
get to do this, you know?

51:28.168 --> 51:30.461
You get to sit around
and read books all day,

51:30.462 --> 51:33.631
have really great
conversations about ideas.

51:33.632 --> 51:37.885
People out in the world, they're
not really doing that.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.262
Think about it.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.431
You could go up to everyone
here and say, "I'm a poet",

51:41.432 --> 51:44.350
and no one will punch you in the face.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.811
I mean, that's something.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.396
Yeah.

51:48.397 --> 51:51.816
I get that.

51:51.817 --> 51:54.235
I just can't get around the fact

51:54.236 --> 51:58.406
that I'm, like, aggressively unhappy here.

51:58.407 --> 52:00.033
Jesse.

52:00.034 --> 52:01.993
Jesse!

52:10.878 --> 52:14.922
That's my number, if you ever want to talk.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.073
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.327
Please tell me this is Vanessa's.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.454
Nope, that's mine.

52:46.455 --> 52:47.705
Wait, you actually read this?

52:47.706 --> 52:48.831
Yeah.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.124
All of it?

52:50.125 --> 52:51.376
Yep.

52:51.377 --> 52:54.087
Unironically?

52:54.088 --> 52:57.215
Very sincerely.

52:57.216 --> 52:59.842
What is it with you girls and vampires?

53:01.387 --> 53:02.887
What's it about?

53:02.888 --> 53:04.180
Vampires.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.891
No, what's it about?

53:06.892 --> 53:08.059
Vampires.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.061
I don't understand. Is it good?

53:10.062 --> 53:11.104
No.

53:11.105 --> 53:13.398
I mean, yeah. But no.

53:13.399 --> 53:14.399
Well, then why read it?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.733
'Cause I like it.

53:15.734 --> 53:18.361
That's no reason to read something.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.697
Why else would you read something?

53:20.698 --> 53:21.864
Seriously.

53:21.865 --> 53:24.200
Many amazing books in the world.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.618
Why would you read this?

53:25.619 --> 53:28.079
Okay, I hate this conversation.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.580
Can we stop?

53:29.581 --> 53:30.915
Wait, this is a trilogy, right?

53:30.916 --> 53:33.668
I'm afraid to answer that.

53:33.669 --> 53:35.503
You've read three of these?

53:35.504 --> 53:36.796
Have you ever read one of them?

53:36.797 --> 53:38.214
What do you think?

53:38.215 --> 53:41.134
How can you hate something
if you've never read it?

53:41.135 --> 53:44.679
I mean, isn't that like what
repressive regimes do?

53:44.680 --> 53:46.764
You want to burn books you don't like?

53:46.765 --> 53:49.183
You're right. You know what I'm gonna do?

53:49.184 --> 53:51.102
I'm gonna read this book, all of it.

53:51.103 --> 53:53.146
And then we can discuss it.

53:53.147 --> 53:55.231
- Right now?
- Yeah, why not?

53:55.232 --> 53:57.233
I mean, how long can it take, really?

53:57.234 --> 54:00.319
This is great, a little book club.

54:02.197 --> 54:03.698
Seriously?

54:03.699 --> 54:05.533
Yup.

54:05.534 --> 54:07.452
See ya soon.

54:42.946 --> 54:45.782
Oh, no, this isn't what it...

54:45.783 --> 54:47.658
I'm reading it as a dare.

54:47.659 --> 54:50.495
It's a bet, actually.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.124
I loved your class!

55:25.823 --> 55:27.198
Should I start?

55:27.199 --> 55:29.033
Please.

55:29.034 --> 55:31.118
Okay.

55:31.119 --> 55:33.496
I liked it.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.873
It was fun and stupid.

55:35.874 --> 55:37.500
And it passed the time.

55:37.501 --> 55:40.837
And it's not Tolstoy, but
it's also not television.

55:40.838 --> 55:43.965
And it made me happy.

55:43.966 --> 55:46.050
Now you.

55:47.553 --> 55:50.388
Thank you.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.183
This...

55:54.184 --> 55:56.394
is the worst book

55:56.395 --> 55:59.146
ever written

55:59.147 --> 56:01.440
in English.

56:01.441 --> 56:05.987
So there are worse books
written in other languages?

56:05.988 --> 56:07.655
Probably not,

56:07.656 --> 56:10.241
unless this book is
translated into other languages.

56:10.242 --> 56:11.909
Okay, we really...

56:11.910 --> 56:13.035
we don't need to do this.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.620
No, please, let's.

56:14.621 --> 56:17.790
I need to know how you read these...

56:17.791 --> 56:20.459
I guess you call them sentences...

56:20.460 --> 56:22.753
close the book, and feel anything

56:22.754 --> 56:23.880
other than offended and sad?

56:23.881 --> 56:25.256
Well, millions of people like it.

56:25.257 --> 56:27.049
So when millions of people like something,

56:27.050 --> 56:28.217
that means it's good?

56:28.218 --> 56:29.844
No, it means millions of people like it.

56:29.845 --> 56:33.139
These books make people happy.

56:33.140 --> 56:35.474
We don't always have to
be thinking about poli-sci

56:35.475 --> 56:37.768
or reading Chaucer, which,
by the way, I hated.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.645
You're not supposed to like it.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.230
But then why read it?

56:42.357 --> 56:43.774
You love college so much, right?

56:43.775 --> 56:46.193
Isn't it all about
understanding different points of view?

56:46.194 --> 56:47.945
It's also about developing taste.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.780
That was snobby. You're a snob.

56:49.781 --> 56:50.948
No, I'm not.

56:50.949 --> 56:52.116
Yes, you are.

56:52.117 --> 56:53.618
You think it's cool to hate things.

56:53.619 --> 56:55.453
And it's not. It's boring.

56:55.454 --> 56:56.704
Talk about what you love,

56:56.705 --> 56:58.623
and keep quiet about what you don't.

56:58.624 --> 57:00.750
Look, I know how this
sounds, but trust me.

57:00.751 --> 57:02.460
This is a big deal, okay?

57:02.461 --> 57:03.920
This country is in bad shape,

57:03.921 --> 57:06.505
and it has to do, in large part, I think,

57:06.506 --> 57:09.550
with people liking
things that are very, very bad.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.385
But according to you.

57:11.386 --> 57:13.763
Why are you the one who gets to
decide what's good and bad?

57:13.764 --> 57:15.473
And do you only want to surround yourself

57:15.474 --> 57:17.391
with people who've
read the same books as you?

57:17.392 --> 57:20.645
I guess we're gonna have to
move on to a specific example...

57:23.357 --> 57:24.857
Where are you?

57:24.858 --> 57:26.150
What do you mean?

57:26.151 --> 57:28.152
I mean, you are somewhere,

57:28.153 --> 57:29.487
but it's not here.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.198
No, I'm... I'm here.

57:32.199 --> 57:34.492
So why are we spending all our time

57:34.493 --> 57:37.036
having a stupid argument about a book?

57:49.967 --> 57:51.008
Hey, Peter.

57:51.009 --> 57:52.843
Zibby.

58:05.023 --> 58:06.565
Peter.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.692
Peter.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.237
What the hell are you doing here?

58:13.323 --> 58:15.032
I don't know.

58:20.914 --> 58:23.666
You know how old I am?

58:23.667 --> 58:25.001
No, how old are you?

58:25.002 --> 58:27.044
It's none of your goddamn business.

58:27.045 --> 58:31.173
Do you know how old I feel like I am?

58:31.174 --> 58:33.884
19.

58:33.885 --> 58:38.222
Since I was 19, I have never felt not 19.

58:38.223 --> 58:42.059
But I shave my face, and
I look in the mirror,

58:42.060 --> 58:43.394
and I'm forced to say,

58:43.395 --> 58:46.564
"This is not a
19-year-old staring back at me".

58:48.984 --> 58:51.944
Teaching here all these years,

58:51.945 --> 58:55.239
I've had to be very clear with myself

58:55.240 --> 58:57.533
that even though I'm
surrounded by 19-year-olds

58:57.534 --> 59:00.077
and I may have felt 19,

59:00.078 --> 59:02.371
I'm not 19 anymore.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.290
You follow me?

59:06.126 --> 59:07.793
Yeah.

59:09.004 --> 59:13.132
Nobody feels like an adult.

59:13.133 --> 59:15.468
It's the world's dirty secret.

59:27.439 --> 59:30.941
How perfect is the universe?

59:30.942 --> 59:33.360
You're still here?

59:33.361 --> 59:35.196
Lucky for you,

59:35.197 --> 59:38.949
'cause you look like you
could use a friend.

59:43.455 --> 59:46.165
Did you know there's so many preservatives
in the food we eat

59:46.166 --> 59:47.875
that they're finding it's taking longer

59:47.876 --> 59:52.004
for our bodies to decompose once we die?

59:52.005 --> 59:53.297
No way. Really?

59:53.298 --> 59:56.467
Preservatives, man. It's messed up.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.305
Want some good news?

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.808
Please.

01:00:03.809 --> 01:00:06.936
Caterpillars... give me my hat.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.730
They're just scooting along, right,

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:11.690
being caterpillars.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.777
At some point, these cells show
up called imaginal cells.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.487
Scientists don't know where they come from

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:17.822
or why they appear,

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:21.200
but these imaginal cells
show up inside the caterpillar

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:23.160
and say, "Get psyched, caterpillar!"

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.663
It's
butterfly-turning-into time".

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.958
And what do all the
other caterpillar cells do

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.960
when these imaginal cells show up?

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:32.545
I have no idea.

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:33.671
They attack 'em!

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.339
Try to kill 'em!

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:38.342
They're like, "Screw you, imaginal cells."

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.136
We're happy being a caterpillar.

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.887
"Get lost!"

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.975
But eventually, the
imaginal cells keep growing

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.853
and overtake the destiny of the caterpillar

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.188
and will it into this cocoon.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.065
And then guess what happens next.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:56.026
The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:00:59.029
The caterpillar turns into a butterfly.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.197
That's awesome.

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.532
I know it is!

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:03.242
Yeah, that's good.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:07.746
And that is why there
is no reason to be afraid,

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:11.750
because everything is okay.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:15.671
Yeah, I don't know if I believe that.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.967
It has to be true.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:22.720
There can be no other way.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.018
You know, I'm not
even sure if you're real.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.811
I mean, seriously.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.814
It's all true, brother.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.399
Whatever you believe.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.569
What is that?

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.612
What are you drinking?

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:42.114
H to the 2 to the O.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:43.657
You should have some.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.910
Got to stay hydrated.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.288
All right.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.216
Oh, thanks.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.401
You with me, bro?

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:24.490
Yeah.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:28.577
I like you, Nat.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.830
Thanks for being my friend.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:34.124
Easiest thing in the world.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.461
I enjoyed this.

01:02:37.462 --> 01:02:39.463
I'm off.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.134
You go get her, man.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.350
Okay.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.148
Be love, man.

01:02:58.149 --> 01:02:59.608
Be love!

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.038
You seem happy.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.165
I am.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.501
What happened?

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.586
I don't know.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:21.964
Something.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.091
Can I tell you some things?

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.426
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:29.430
Okay, well, except for the book thing,

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.267
which was genuinely super annoying,

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:38.856
I... I feel really good about you.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:44.695
It's been a while since I
felt that way about someone.

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:48.324
And I like it.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.784
Yeah, me too.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:54.079
I want you to stay here with me tonight.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.042
You have a roommate.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:01.545
She's sleeping elsewhere.

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:06.425
So will you stay here?

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:10.888
Yes.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:13.599
Good.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.392
But I have to tell you something.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:23.734
This... it would be my...

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:26.403
first time.

01:04:29.616 --> 01:04:32.576
But I want to.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.870
With you.

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:41.168
Okay...

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:42.961
I have to...

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.254
hold on.

01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.965
I'll... I'll be back in a second, okay?

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.967
Okay.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.163
I should never have told you that.

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:19.748
No, no, it's good.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:24.545
I'm... I'm glad you did.

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.922
So is that a problem?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:30.384
Well, yeah, it is.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.469
Why?

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.682
Okay, well, first of all, I'm 35.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.600
- You don't look it.
- Thank you.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.810
Plus, it doesn't bother me.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.145
Well, it bothers me.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.312
Well, it shouldn't.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:45.399
Age is a stupid thing to obsess over.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.860
What if reincarnation is real?

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.361
Think about that.

01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:52.823
What if I'm, like,
thousands of years older than you?

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:55.492
Okay, that's not really a sound argument.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:56.827
Why not?

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:58.620
Because it's like saying,

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.373
"What if reality is all an illusion?"

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.375
Then there are no consequences to anything.

01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.252
We're completely off the hook.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:08.380
And I believe in consequences.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.507
No, you believe in guilt.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.843
Maybe.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:18.265
But guilt before we act is called morality.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.689
Why did you come back here?

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:28.025
To see you, but I didn't know that you...

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:29.359
Why should that matter?

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.945
I mean, isn't it, I don't know, flattering?

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.072
Listen.

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.866
Elizabeth.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:41.538
Sex is really complicated, okay?

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.875
I didn't quite understand
that when I was younger,

01:06:44.876 --> 01:06:46.335
but I do now.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:48.587
Okay, look, I didn't
sign one of those contracts

01:06:48.588 --> 01:06:50.464
when I was in high school, okay?

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:53.300
I'm not a prude or whatever.

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:57.721
It's just, I never met
anyone that I trusted

01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:02.100
or even liked enough

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:04.102
until now.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.233
I can't.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:17.407
Are you not attracted to me?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.618
No. I mean, yes, I am.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.079
It's just,

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.335
I also care about you a
lot already, somehow.

01:07:28.336 --> 01:07:31.922
So essentially,

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:33.257
you don't want to sleep with me

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:37.386
because you like and respect me too much.

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.391
Basically.

01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.851
Yeah.

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:47.271
That's, like, the saddest thing ever.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.689
Look, I want to be in your life.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.898
I do.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:52.693
Yeah, I already have
an older brother, okay?

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.653
And I don't need some mentor.

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:02.452
I can't just say yes to everything.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:07.416
Elizabeth.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.334
Stop calling me that.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.419
What?

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.628
No one calls me that.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.088
You need to leave right now.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.340
I'm really upset, and you need to go.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.301
Okay.

01:08:20.888 --> 01:08:23.098
Get out!

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:37.029

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.575

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.743
Well, well, well.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:47.456
<i>♪ Since you left me here ♪</i>

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.751
Now I remember you.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:53.420
You do?

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.339
Not really.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:09:00.510
<i>♪ I stumbled ♪</i>

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:02.054
<i>♪ On a new world ♪</i>

Rough day?

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.183
Yeah.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:12.104
<i>"Mock on. Mock on."</i>

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:15.067
<i>'Tis all in vain.</i>

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:22.115
<i>"and the wind blows it back again".</i>

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.368
Blake.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.703

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.627

French fries.

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:41.009
I was just about to order a basket.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.886
<i>♪ To lose my mind ♪</i>

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:46.348
<i>♪ I've got a right to lose my mind ♪</i>

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.441
Hey.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.486
Can you get me a beer?

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:00.862
Yeah, have mine.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.533
Of course, I'm thrilled.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.451
Newly minted PhD.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:07.994
I'm feeling very fancy

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:11.665
and officially teaching
Ode on a Grecian Urn

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:13.041
for the first time.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.376
It's like heaven, right?

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.627
Right. Right, right, right.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.462
And I decide to be a little dramatic.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.714
I'm really gonna go for it

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.382
and just recite the whole thing out loud.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.425
What the hell, right?

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:22.843
Sure.

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:26.972
And it's going very
well, if I do say so myself.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:30.642
And as I reach the immortal final lines

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:34.104
of one of the great
poems ever written in English,

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:37.566
I hear myself say the following:

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:41.361
"Beauth is trudy, trudy beauth".

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.781
"That is all ye know on
Earth and all ye need know".

01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.491
That is great.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.785
Great story.

01:10:48.786 --> 01:10:50.662
When did you fall for the Romantics?

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.164
Was it, like... I'm just curious,

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.499
but was it in college or grad school?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.460
'Cause I knew almost
nothing about those guys

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.295
before your class.

01:10:58.296 --> 01:10:59.629
Your class.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.715
I can gush, right?

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.341
I mean, I still think about it.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.760
It's just...

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:09.222
What?

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.808
You're very enthusiastic.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.353
I guess.

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:28.992
I have a car.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.580
Okay.

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:40.796
I would like for you to get in it with me,

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:44.925
and I would like to drive us somewhere.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.846
Where?

01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:59.397
Don't worry about the fries.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:01.817
They know me here.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.699
Yo, Eric, what's up?

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.243
Oh, hey, man.

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.141
Okay, you got to go.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.977
What?

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:39.312
Out. Go, now.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.398
Are you serious?

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.941
Yep.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:47.195
Yeah, I don't have to
stay the night or anything,

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.573
but could I... could I
at least catch my breath?

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:52.075
Sure.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.744
How long do you think that'll be?

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:58.665
- What?
- No, no.

01:12:58.666 --> 01:13:01.167
It's just funny to me all of a sudden.

01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:04.212
What about it is amusing to you?

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:08.592
Your post-coital cigarette,
for one, is amusing to me.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:10.176
What, you never smoked?

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.178
- No, I did.
- But you quit.

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:13.555
- Yeah.
- Pussy.

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.058
Okay, you are the same Judith Fairfield

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.935
I took British Romantic literature from?

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:21.313
"From whom I took British
Romantic literature",

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.023
and yes, that's me.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.442
But just because we screwed,
don't assume we're suddenly...

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.777
what is it you kids say nowadays?

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.154
BFFs?

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:30.447
Yeah, that's not really...

01:13:30.448 --> 01:13:32.365
I mean, what do we really
know about each other?

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.034
You're a nonsmoker. Congratulations.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.702
You're going to live to be a hundred.

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:37.787
But what does it matter
if your life is joyless?

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.373
And it will be. Trust me.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:41.958
What's happening here?

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:44.002
You're getting your
clothes and you're leaving,

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.962
and I'm going to take an Ambien.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.047
No, I meant, what is hap...

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.298
I mean, seriously.

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:50.008
You weren't thinking we were gonna cuddle

01:13:50.009 --> 01:13:52.886
the rest of the night as
I read you Wordsworth?

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:54.888
Not anymore.

01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:56.640
Good.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.767
I've taught at this
school for over 20 years.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.020
I've seen the emergence of
your kind like an infection...

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:05.148
all these effete, overarticulate man-boys

01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:06.942
who never learned to toughen up.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.485
Don't be one of them.

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:09.611
Go work with your hands.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:10.654
Build something.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.489
Punch someone in the face.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.241
Too bad Norman Mailer's dead.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.160
You guys would have been
perfect for each other.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:18.328
Shall I count to ten?

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:19.329
Wait, just, can...

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.915
hold on just one second, okay?

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:28.088
You don't seem very happy.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:32.509
Your powers of deduction are stunning.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.928
You must have gone to a very good college.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:37.305
I'm just confused how...

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.932
I mean, you're a tenured professor

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:41.685
in one of the most
prestigious English departments

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:42.727
in the country.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:44.562
That's not fulfilling?

01:14:44.563 --> 01:14:46.856
Sit through a faculty
meeting at a liberal arts college,

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.316
Mr. Young Person.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.652
I assure you, you will
lose all faith in humanity.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.904
Okay, but what about the classroom?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.739
There had to have been some joy there.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.117
I mean, you were such a good teacher.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:59.202
Thank you.

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.162
I like to teach.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.831
I used to love it.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.374
What happened?

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:08.294
Life happened.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.672
Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit more.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.257
Well, that's all you're gonna get.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:15.385
Unlike you, I'm not from
the "let me tell you"

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.096
"every sick, sordid
detail of my life" generation.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.723
I value discretion.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.766
I loathe self-pity.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.685
So let's just leave it at this:

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:27.647
People are disappointing.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:29.399
Yeah, it's just, I would think...

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.942
- Don't get comfortable.
- Sorry.

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.152
I would just think

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:34.571
that spending so much time with those poems

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:38.241
would make you more, you
know, optimistic and hopeful.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.617
Nonsense.

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.952
They were miserable men

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.912
who were granted a few
moments of transcendence,

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.414
and they had the talent and foresight

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.583
to grab pen and paper and write it down.

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:48.752
Byron was probably the happiest of the lot,

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.921
only because he put his dick in everything.

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.799
This is the saddest evening of my life.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.092
Get used to it.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:59.721
My advice to you is this:

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:03.975
Put some armor around that
gooey little heart of yours.

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:14.527
Well, at least I appreciate the irony.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.821
I just had the least
romantic night of my life

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.573
with a Romantics professor.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.467
For what it's worth,

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.637
I meant everything I said about your class.

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:45.809
It opened something in me,

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.812
and I'm grateful for it.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:51.898
And if my heart is gooey,

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:55.819
you're at least
partially responsible for that.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.925
So you're still uninspired by admissions.

01:17:18.926 --> 01:17:20.802
Yeah, pretty much.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.138
No little Jesse Fishers out there?

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.723
Well, if there are, I'm not meeting them.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:29.686
Well, maybe you're
just not recognizing them.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.813
Anyway,

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:34.274
I do appreciate you coming by.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:35.692
I really do.

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:37.152
It's great to see you one last time

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.946
before I get the hell out of here.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.365
You feeling any better about things?

01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:44.450
Well,

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:46.494
I tried to turn the clock back.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.873
It doesn't work.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:52.709
No, it doesn't.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.920
Now I just...

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.299
I keep waiting to feel
more resolve somehow.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.886
What if I'm like one of those prisoners

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:04.387
that gets paroled

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:06.222
and finds he can't handle
life on the outside

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:07.891
so he commits a petty crime

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:12.937
so he can go back to what he knows?

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:15.732
You think this place is a prison?

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:20.653
Well, any place you
don't leave is a prison.

01:18:25.242 --> 01:18:28.578
Well, whatever.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:32.749
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:36.544
Hey.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:39.005
You know why you're my second favorite
professor of all time?

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:40.590
I have no idea.

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.927
Because you had us read
books by authors you hated.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.933
Feel good about what you did here.

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:54.979
Thank you.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.615
Get in your car now, and leave me be.

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:26.344
<i>"Dear Zibby, even after all these months,"</i>

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:28.304
<i>I'm still half-expecting a letter from you</i>

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.723
<i>to be sitting in my mailbox.</i>

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:33.142
<i>I'm sure you have little
left to say to me at this point,</i>

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:36.104
<i>but your letters are very much missed.</i>

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:39.357
<i>I know I hurt you, and I'm sorry.</i>

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:40.942
<i>Any bone-headed moves I made</i>

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:44.237
<i>were born of confusion and not malice.</i>

01:19:44.238 --> 01:19:46.823
<i>That said, I've been
feeling lately the stirrings</i>

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:49.575
<i>of something I can only call growth.</i>

01:19:49.576 --> 01:19:53.121
<i>It's a tribute of sorts to
say that someone 16 years my junior</i>

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:56.624
<i>helped me finally start acting my age.</i>

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.294
<i>Awise man in a red hat once told me,</i>

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.838
<i>'Everything is okay'.</i>

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.257
<i>I didn't believe him then,</i>

01:20:04.258 --> 01:20:07.760
<i>"but for some reason, I'm starting to".</i>

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:17.020
Sorry, we're closed!

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:19.981
Hey.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.190
Hi.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:28.573
Are you here for this?

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.870
I always notice you reading
it when you're in here.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:36.039
Yeah.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.790
Any bookstore I'm in, I have to read the...

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:38.958
Last three pages.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.376
I know. They're devastating.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.005
Yeah.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:49.719
I'm Jesse.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.887
I'm Ana.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:53.139
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:57.226
I love books.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.854
I do in, like, the dorkiest way possible.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:00.980
Oh, me too.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:02.357
It's a problem.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:06.444
Like, I love trees 'cause
they give us books.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.447
It's super cool of the
trees to do that, right?

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.574
I'm actually...

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:13.034
this is weird.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.286
I'm actually trying to read less.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.621
Why?

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.998
I felt like I wasn't
watching enough television.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:23.836
No, I just... I started to
feel like reading about life

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:26.923
was taking time away from
actually living life,

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:30.426
so I'm trying to, like, accept
invitations to things,

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.261
say "hi" to the world a little more.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:35.264
That sounds scary.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:36.599
It's going well?

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.768
It's... okay.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.103
Most of the time when I'm out,

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:41.646
I keep thinking I'd be so much happier

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:43.356
in bed with a book,

01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:48.277
and that makes me feel not super cool.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.488
I still read tons.

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:54.117
I just feel like I'm more
aware of a book's limitations.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.952
Does that make sense?

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:59.205
Yeah, totally.

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:00.540
How am I doing here?

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.417
What? Here in this conversation?

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.501
Yeah.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.838
Very well. You are doing great.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.804
So you maybe want to
get away from these books

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.140
and walk somewhere?

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:18.599
Yeah, okay.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.977
- Really?
- Sure, let's do it.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:23.020
Great. Great.

01:22:23.021 --> 01:22:25.398
And feel free to invite your
husband or boyfriend.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:27.316
They're both pretty busy right now, so...

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.651
Probably just be us, then.

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.195
Yeah. Just us.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.019
Hello.

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.813
Oh, hi.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:07.857
It's Dean.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:10.526
Franzen? We like the same writer.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:12.904
Right, hey. Dean, what's up?

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:16.949
You gave me your number,
and you told me to call you.

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.494
Yeah. No, it's good to hear from you.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:20.870
How are you doing?

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:25.291
I'm pretty good, yeah.

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:27.168
Things...

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:29.086
I've been...

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:35.343
Dean?

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:38.137
I just took a bunch of pills.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.765
What?

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.059
I just took a lot of pills.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:46.354
How many?

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.397
I don't know.

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:53.736
I'm really scared.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.363
- Where are you?
- In my dorm.

01:23:55.364 --> 01:23:57.323
Stay... stay there, okay?

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:58.991
Stay right there.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:00.910
Okay, yeah, just stay
ri... I'm gonna make a call,

01:24:00.911 --> 01:24:02.245
and I'm gonna call...

01:24:02.246 --> 01:24:04.038
I need you to stay by
the phone, though, okay?

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.122
Dean?

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:10.044
Miss Hanson to reception area, please.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.129
Miss Hanson.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:26.894
Hey.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.439
Hey, man.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.735
How you feeling?

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:38.281
Kind of ridiculous.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.825
You didn't have to
drive all the way out here.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:44.161
I flew, you bastard.

01:24:44.162 --> 01:24:46.956
Thanks.

01:24:46.957 --> 01:24:51.294
For picking up the phone.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:54.297
I didn't know who else to call.

01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:59.635
Can I make a suggestion?

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:00.970
Yeah.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:02.555
Stop reading this.

01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:04.140
Why?

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:08.144
Because he killed himself,
and you're not gonna do that.

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:11.063
You need to read something else.

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:14.483
Listen, don't be a genius who dies young.

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:15.985
Be one who dies old.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.987
Being old is cool.

01:25:17.988 --> 01:25:20.323
Grow old and die old.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.617
It's a better arc.

01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:24.327
Listen to me, man.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:29.665
This right now, all this
stuff you're feeling,

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.917
this is a footnote, okay?

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.794
You're gonna graduate,

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.047
and you're gonna get out in the world

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:38.507
and stumble into something
like contentment.

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:41.761
I know it.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:43.846
Is that how it's been for you?

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.890
Hell, no.

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:51.354
But some days are all right, you know?

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:54.607
Some days are like a gift,

01:25:54.608 --> 01:25:56.942
and some days suck.

01:25:56.943 --> 01:25:59.695
But all of that's okay.

01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:04.575
So I'm taking you off post-modernists.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:09.622
What are you prescribing?

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:13.042
There are these vampire books.

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:15.336
The kids love 'em.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:20.257
Trust me, they will
empty your mind completely.

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:27.014
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:31.394
You flew all the way back here to see me,

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:34.605
and we had, like, two conversations.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:38.484
I have a soft spot for good readers.

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.277
They're hard to find these days.

01:27:01.258 --> 01:27:04.969
I really did miss you.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.054
You know, we had this thing happening,

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:12.017
and it was so exciting, and
then you were just gone.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.938
But it's okay now.

01:27:15.939 --> 01:27:18.065
I get it.

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:28.200
I sometimes feel like I'm
looking down on myself,

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:32.872
like there's this older, wiser me

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:36.876
watching over this
19-year-old rough draft

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:40.963
who's full of all this potential

01:27:40.964 --> 01:27:44.300
but has to live more

01:27:44.301 --> 01:27:48.763
to catch up with that other self somehow.

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.766
And...

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:53.142
I know I'll get there.

01:27:53.143 --> 01:27:56.145
It's just sometimes I think

01:27:56.146 --> 01:28:00.775
I want to rush the process, you know?

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:02.359
And I don't know.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:09.033
Maybe... maybe I thought you
were some sort of shortcut.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:15.164
Does that make any sense?

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:22.963
If I wrote you, I would be like,

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:25.883
"This is the best rough draft ever".

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:38.145
Seriously?

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:41.023
Roommates.

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:49.949
Well, I should get back to adulthood.

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.158
Yeah.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:54.078
See you there soon, I guess.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:28:59.875
Bye, Zibby.

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:01.961
Bye, Jesse.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:30:00.853
You're so beautiful and fascinating

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:01.979
and age-appropriate.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.063
What?

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:05.441
Oh, nothing.

Look, you're getting wise.

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.653
I'm getting old.

01:30:50.654 --> 01:30:54.990
Not the same thing.
I say you're getting wise.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.493
You worry about getting old?

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:01.455
I think being old's gonna be okay.

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:04.166
It's just the getting there that
kicks your ass, you know?

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.460
You're gonna be a great old guy.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:07.753
Really?

01:31:07.754 --> 01:31:09.213
I feel like that's the nicest thing

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.631
anyone's ever said to me.

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.299
Unless it's a criticism,

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.802
like, "You're already
judgmental and racist."

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:51.046
