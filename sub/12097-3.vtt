Is that you, Chester?

Oh, darling, darling,

01:41.668 --> 01:43.168
you did escape.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.170
That's right,

04:18.324 --> 04:19.324
the way you've been
spending dough,

04:19.325 --> 04:20.826
I can't afford it.

04:20.827 --> 04:21.827
You can't afford it?

04:21.827 --> 04:22.828
You can't afford anything.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.329
That's because
you've got the brain

real sickly looking too.
