00:27.440 --> 00:30.557
Remind Daddy to get some milk
while you're out.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.311
Right. Have you had a wee-wee?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.311
Ah! Good idea.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.470
I won't be a minute.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.996
Hello.
- Hello.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.593
Hello.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.839
There's another one coming, look. Look!
Come on, goosey.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.878
You're not supposed to eat it.
It's for the ducks.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.910
Look, darling. This is your new
baby sister Ellie.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.715
<i>Mummy's gonna be wondering where we are,
in't she?</i>

01:17.800 --> 01:21.315
<i>Look. There's two there. Look!
- Two little ducks.</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:24.358
<i>Two little ducks. Quack! Quack!
- Yeah.</i>

01:24.440 --> 01:28.638
And here's your other baby sister...Olivia.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.152
Boo!

01:34.520 --> 01:35.999
Hey, stinker!

01:37.080 --> 01:38.638
There you go.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.153
Thanks.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.678
Do I owe you anything for this?

01:46.720 --> 01:49.359
See you, tiger.
You be a good boy for Mummy, then. Yeah?

01:49.440 --> 01:51.396
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:51.480 --> 01:54.597
Same time next week, then?
- Yeah, same time next week.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.918
See you, Pete.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.992
Bills...bills...bills...

02:13.080 --> 02:15.389
William...William. Nightmare.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.285
<i>It's got a real '70s feel to it,
which you don't want.</i>

02:26.440 --> 02:30.638
<i>The shoes she's wearing are 35 pounds.
- How much was that skirt again?</i>

02:30.720 --> 02:32.715
<i>That skirt was 35
pounds. Very inexpensive.</i>

02:33.239 --> 02:35.157
Really? It looks an
awful lot more expensive.

02:35.240 --> 02:40.268
<i>The high street is getting so good now,
because they look at the big collections.</i>

02:40.360 --> 02:42.920
<i>So, they create the looks but
obviously give...</i>

02:43.000 --> 02:44.956
Arrrgh!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.549
Hello.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.671
Jesus, you made me jump!

02:52.760 --> 02:55.957
Surprised to see us, then?
- Or do you always dress like that?

02:56.040 --> 02:59.032
You're back so early.
- The flight landed at five.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.678
A week early.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.955
Due back the 4th. I even wrote it down.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.510
I lost that piece of paper.
- Well, maybe it's underneath all this crap.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.511
I was going to tidy up.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.433
You were supposed to meet us at Heathrow.
I lent you the car.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.034
Ah, yes. The car.
- We had to get the coach up.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.031
After a 12-hour flight.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.758
How were the Maldives?

03:17.840 --> 03:21.071
Not as nice as Mauritius.
- I'm going to go and get some coffee.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.391
I hope you haven't got skid marks on
that sofa! - No, of course not!

03:26.960 --> 03:28.996
I'm sure that mark was there before.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.071
Do you not want milk with those?
- We're out of milk.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.550
Oh, great. Black coffee.
- Er...yeah.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.108
<i>Where's the coffee?</i>

03:42.560 --> 03:44.516
Mum!

03:46.880 --> 03:47.949
Hello.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.429
It's lovely to see you. How was your flight?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.431
Well, you know, it was a charter.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.238
You even had to pay for your drinks.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.515
Still, at this time of day, who'd
want a drink?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.513
We'd have paid for you to fly scheduled.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.353
I did think David might have collected me
from the airport.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.793
Oh, he's at work.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.791
At 7:30?!

04:07.880 --> 04:11.475
Mm. He's had a lot of early starts.
Since the twins were born, actually.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.471
Well, come on.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.710
Let's go and see the little darlings.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.755
And my grandson, of course.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.036
Er...Mum.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.234
Right. I'll bring the bags in, then,
shall I?

04:28.560 --> 04:32.473
It is not pubic.
- It is. It's all crinkly.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.630
God! He's been using my razor.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.234
Come on! No-one shaves their pubes.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.117
Well, not blokes anyway.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.997
Well, maybe some. But not Pete.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.672
He's got to go, Adam.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.070
Give him some more time.
He said he'll mend his ways. He's tidied up.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.754
And he's promised to wear clothes
in the future.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.876
We said he could stay a month,
not six weeks.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.518
We can't kick him out now.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.797
No, we can't give him a lift,
because he's buggered the bloody car.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.475
I didn't like him staying in the first
place. It felt like we were taking sides.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.391
But Jenny stayed in their house.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.836
And since he's been here we haven't
seen her. No. He's got to go.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.070
You know, you're being very unfair.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.199
If any of your friends needed help,
I'd be there for them, no questions asked.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.875
Look, one last chance. OK?

05:14.960 --> 05:18.518
If he's out of order again, if he does
anything to put you out in the slightest,

05:18.635 --> 05:20.193
I will ask him to go.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.872
Anything?
- I promise.

05:24.236 --> 05:25.638
<i>Are you going to be long in there?</i>

05:25.720 --> 05:29.713
We'll be as long as we want!
- It's just I'm a bit desperate for the loo.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.395
Look, I am not getting out of this bath.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.319
OK. You can come in now.

05:42.560 --> 05:44.391
Oh, thanks. Sorry about this.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.630
Come on. Come on.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.591
Erm...oh.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.716
Actually, it's a number two.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.558
I'll help him pack.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.712
Divorce, is it?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.352
What makes you say that?

06:07.480 --> 06:10.278
Woman out of work for a few years,
it's usually a divorce.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.591
Well, it's not. We're separated.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.990
Same difference.
Ideally, how much would you like to earn?

06:17.080 --> 06:22.955
Well, ideally, I'd like to cover my share
of the mortgage...clothes...food.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.754
Nice to have the odd luxury
every now and then.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.549
35000 pounds? Have you got anything like
that? - If we did, I'd apply for 'em.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.473
Did you say you'd got shorthand?
- Yeah. And typing.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.358
And a pair of rubber gloves?
- Sorry?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.078
There's a firm here needs a cleaner.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.516
Yeah, but I wouldn't be able to use
my secretarial skills, would I?

06:41.600 --> 06:43.798
You've been out the job market a while.

06:43.899 --> 06:46.196
You'll have to start at the
bottom of the career ladder.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.633
Fine.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.627
Here's one that might suit you.

06:49.794 --> 06:53.158
Requires a bright person
capable of working unsupervised.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.798
Hello, me.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.836
<i>Oh, no, you're too old.</i>

06:58.040 --> 07:00.952
<i>Cleaning...cleaning.</i>

07:01.040 --> 07:03.190
Stuffing envelopes?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.629
<i>Cleaning.</i>

07:06.720 --> 07:10.759
Ah, secretarial work. A nice quiet office.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.353
A funeral parlour?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.237
Yeah...

07:14.320 --> 07:16.231
What's wrong with a funeral parlour?

07:17.720 --> 07:19.676
Nothing. Nothing at all.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.836
I mean, we all need funeral parlours,
don't we?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.751
Eventually.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.388
Yeah. So, how's it going?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.391
Good.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.994
A few teething troubles.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.674
Anyone mind if I close a window?

07:36.760 --> 07:39.354
Catch your death in here.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.152
My life is finished.
- Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.233
My marriage is over.
I'm kipping in my best mate's spare room.

07:52.320 --> 07:56.996
I'm this far away from being a bag lady.
- It's closer than that, mate.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.638
It's not me. It's Rachel.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.878
Big issue?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.555
Big issue.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.752
Oi! Psst! Psst! David!

08:15.240 --> 08:18.471
Someone's turned our drive into
a bloody ashtray.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.074
Ah, Heather. You've arrived, then?
- Looks like it.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.636
Hello, Joshy. Building
a tower? Jolly good.

08:28.398 --> 08:30.212
Very good of you to offer
to help with the twins.

08:30.280 --> 08:34.114
Jack didn't mind you coming over?
- It wouldn't be easy for Karen on her own.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.510
I'll stay as long as I can.
Would you like a drink, David?

08:40.600 --> 08:42.875
Er, it's a bit early.
- Oh, not in Europe.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.473
I haven't adjusted yet.

08:44.560 --> 08:48.678
Well, I won't, but don't let me stop you...
having another.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.149
Hi, darling. How was your day?

08:51.240 --> 08:54.516
Oh, busy. Probably a picnic compared
to yours.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.672
Still, it must be easier having
Heather here?

08:57.760 --> 09:01.150
Hey, Mum, have you sterilised
those bottles yet?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.993
Oh, my God! I must be jet-lagged.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.589
Who'd have thought it?
Back to a bedsit at my age.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.875
You could always move in with your mum.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.235
I don't like that Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.074
There's something not right about him.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.318
Don't forget your vegetables, Peter.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.676
Well, OK, not your mum.
But you must have friends who'll put you up.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.320
Yeah. I thought I did.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.960
David and Karen. They've got plenty of room.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.837
No. No. They've just had twins.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.708
Oh, no. I wouldn't want all that
crying again. - No.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.951
I know. I know where there's a free bed.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.397
To be honest, life's like 100 % better
since Pete moved out.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.508
Not for me, it's not.
How did you cope with all his...little ways?

09:58.022 --> 10:00.273
Used a lot of bleach.
- Yeah.

10:01.512 --> 10:05.166
It's funny, we're sort of getting
on really well since we separated.

10:05.217 --> 10:06.599
We're quite matey now.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.752
It's putting that bit of distance
between us.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.955
Hello?

10:11.040 --> 10:13.918
Oh, hello. We were just talking about you.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.996
I beg your pardon?

10:22.560 --> 10:24.869
You might want to get some more sherry in.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.758
No, I bought a few bottles
when I knew Mum was coming.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.592
I know.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.432
You might want to get some more.

10:32.480 --> 10:36.359
It's the Costa del Sol, David.
Cocktail hour all day.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.916
Karen...she's an alcoholic.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.956
Don't be ridiculous.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.995
What would you call it, then?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.598
Unhappy.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.148
I don't think she and Dad are getting on
that well.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.435
Maybe he has to pay her bar bill.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.592
David, she is not an alcoholic.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.076
She's not. How can she be?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.628
She doesn't have her first drink
till lunchtime.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.915
She doesn't get up till 12.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.991
I bet that's Josh.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.198
Or it could be Heather sneaking out
her empties.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.239
David...come and have a look.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.360
Sweet. He's come to see his sisters.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.510
Darling, it's time for bed now.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.750
You can play with the girls in the morning.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.114
Josh!

11:42.320 --> 11:44.959
Come here, poppet.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.116
Pete, I'm not sure about this.
I should speak to Rachel or give her a call.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.270
She seemed pretty adamant.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.909
It's only for a few days,
just till I get myself sorted.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.150
Besides, little Adam likes his dad at home.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.708
But you're not home, Pete. Have you got it?

12:00.800 --> 12:03.872
We're just friends. Yeah?
- Yeah. That's why it'll work.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.394
You are looking for a place to live,
aren't you?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.357
It's not all part of some master plan?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.510
Do you think I could be that Machiavellian?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.272
I didn't even know you knew the word.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.396
Guardian crossword.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.436
We'll have to have some ground rules.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.592
All right. Name them.
- I don't know. I haven't thought of any.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.000
We'll have our own flannels,
that sort of thing.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.832
Done.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.518
Right, love. What's for tea?

12:35.680 --> 12:37.352
Evening, all.

12:39.280 --> 12:43.068
Everything all right?
- I think you should go upstairs, David.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.474
Karen! What's going on?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.318
Hello, Joshy.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.674
What?
- Look again, David.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.075
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

13:05.160 --> 13:07.879
I was only playing.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.111
Hey, I told you this would work out,
didn't I?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.315
What would?
- Eh?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.318
What would?

13:20.320 --> 13:22.072
Me stopping here.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.879
The first six hours have gone OK, yeah.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.916
Well, so far so good, then.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.899
<i>Hey, if you're getting
up, put the kettle on.</i>

13:31.369 --> 13:33.239
While you're at it,
bung a tea bag in a mug.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.039
And for you, I'll even add milk
and one sugar.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.196
It's all booked.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.475
Venice? Ooooh!

13:54.200 --> 13:57.795
We fly out Friday evening after you finish
work. Back on Monday morning.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.071
Oh, I don't know. What about Adam?

14:01.160 --> 14:04.118
It's all right. Pete said he'll look
after him. - Jen!

14:10.200 --> 14:12.714
What?
- Where have the tea bags gone?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.951
It's your cupboard now. Mine are over there.
- Eh?

14:18.920 --> 14:22.674
Go on, then.
Use these till you get yourself sorted.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.076
Happy Christmas.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.391
They're beautiful.

14:28.480 --> 14:31.392
I bet they're a handful, though.
- Yeah. Two handfuls.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.755
Yeah, not that David's held them much.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.956
Work's just gone ballistic.
- Yeah. Right.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.991
How's my big mate Josh enjoying
having two baby sisters?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.911
Aye.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.718
A bit jealous, is he?

14:49.800 --> 14:52.439
We were rather hoping we might discuss that.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.990
Come on. Let's get you something to eat.

14:59.960 --> 15:04.590
The fact is, Josh has been displaying some
antisocial tendencies towards the girls.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.116
Murderous.
- David, that's a bit much.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.111
Manslaughter?

15:10.200 --> 15:14.034
There was an incident involving an iron.
I think he just feels a bit pushed out.

15:14.120 --> 15:17.874
We were wondering if maybe
he could spend a couple of days with you.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.633
Because you don't want him
to feel pushed out?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.870
No, it was his idea. He says he wants to.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.837
And we want to indulge him.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.717
You mean, you're serious?

15:26.800 --> 15:30.509
Yeah. Just for a couple of days,
while we get the twins settled in.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.672
And then, when he comes back,
we can give him more attention.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.273
We thought we'd say it's a holiday.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.271
Who for?

15:37.360 --> 15:40.113
Look, guys, you know,
we'd love to help you, but...

15:40.200 --> 15:42.668
Adam's right.
We would absolutely love to help you.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.069
What?!

15:48.640 --> 15:51.598
What do we want a four-year-old for?
We've just got rid of Pete.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.114
You said you would help my friends
without question.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.353
Yeah, but David and Karen
are my friends too.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.432
Anyway, it was you Josh asked to stay with.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.034
Is it my fault kids find me fun?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.917
All right, Rach?
- Good.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.752
Yeah, we'll be fine.
- Good luck.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.355
All set, big fella?
- I want to sit in the front!

16:18.440 --> 16:20.396
Terrific.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.073
Do you like car washes, Josh?
- I've never been in one.

16:31.160 --> 16:35.233
Your dad washes his own car?
- They do it for him at work.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.357
Yeah, well. Of course.
- I want to sit in the front!

16:38.440 --> 16:40.317
Do you want to drive?

16:40.400 --> 16:41.753
Cool!

16:41.840 --> 16:43.353
Come on, then.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.840
Where are you two off to?

16:47.920 --> 16:50.115
We're going to the park. Gonna go
on the slide.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.839
It's not your weekend to have him.
- Jen!

16:54.920 --> 16:56.319
Yeah. Have a good time.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.949
Would you like to come?
- I'm all right.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.272
All right. Come on, tiger.
That's it. Good boy.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.597
Shall we go in the car?

17:08.680 --> 17:10.432
Yeah.

17:16.319 --> 17:21.348
That's a good boy.
- Pete! Give us a sec.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.869
That is a brilliant bit of driving, Josh.
Fantastic.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.837
Right. Into the back with you.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.751
Adam, you've not shut the sunroof.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.796
Or my window.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.514
Did you switch the engine off, Josh?

17:45.000 --> 17:46.797
Josh, where's my key?

17:46.880 --> 17:48.711
Where is the key?

17:48.800 --> 17:51.439
Adam, hurry up! Josh, give us the keys.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.755
Give it to me! Give it to me,
you little bollocks!

17:54.840 --> 17:56.796
Arrrrgggghhh!

18:00.760 --> 18:02.716
Oh, Josh!

18:03.160 --> 18:06.072
No! Josh! Shut your eyes!

18:15.880 --> 18:18.235
<i>Oh! Oh, my God!</i>

18:18.600 --> 18:21.239
Can you not get it out, Adam? Oh, my...

18:21.880 --> 18:25.236
Oh, my God! Ooh!

18:27.160 --> 18:28.832
Do you think he'll be all right?

18:28.920 --> 18:31.115
Who? Josh? Yeah, he'll be fine.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.317
What are we doing on Wednesday?
- Er...baby-sitting?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.994
So, we're not going out, then? Good.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.913
No. Why?
- I need to invite some people for dinner.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.198
David, it may have escaped your attention,
darling, but I've just given birth to twins.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.191
Well, Josh is out of the way.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.999
Ramona's doing nothing
and Heather will lend a hand.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.150
I could make one of my sherry trifles.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.549
Some people will be driving, you know.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.596
What people exactly?

18:55.680 --> 18:57.193
Oh, just a few business contacts.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.113
Business? I thought this was
going to be fun.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.111
I rather hoped you might be helping.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.997
You mean, I wasn't going to be invited?

19:04.080 --> 19:07.629
Of course you'd be welcome, but you
said yourself it wouldn't be much fun.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.280
It beats standing over the stove all night.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.920
Right. So, that's six, then.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.518
Including Heather.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.068
You'd better get some more wine in.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.108
At least we didn't have the hot wax.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.390
Mountjoy Funeral Services.
How might we be of assistance?

19:42.480 --> 19:44.630
Hello? Hello?

19:44.720 --> 19:46.358
Hello?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.675
Line just went dead... Ahh.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.671
This isn't really working out,
is it, Mrs Gifford?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.672
Look, I'm sorry, Mr Mountjoy.
I know I keep mentioning death...

19:56.760 --> 19:59.194
That isn't actually what I was referring to.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.030
Right.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.634
I've had complaints, Mrs Gifford.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.030
Is this about Mrs Cunningham?
Sorry, but that woman was impossible.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.031
That woman had just lost her husband.

20:08.120 --> 20:13.069
She wanted him cremated, dressed like
Elvis Presley. The Vegas years! Come on!

20:13.160 --> 20:15.628
This isn't about Mrs Cunningham.
- Oh.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.713
I've had a gentleman on from the council.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.711
He was almost in tears.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.792
Claimed you called him a Nazi.
- That's not true.

20:24.880 --> 20:29.032
It was ''fascist''.
The thing is, they've got ludicrous rules.

20:29.120 --> 20:33.636
You know, no headstones,
no landscaping, no angels with wings.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.029
Mr Mountjoy, people want choice.

20:36.120 --> 20:40.352
The freedom to bid farewell to their
loved ones the way they see fit.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.796
Including dressed like Elvis Presley.
The Vegas years or otherwise.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.203
I really think you'd be better suited
to a job

20:47.397 --> 20:51.192
that doesn't involve dealing
with the public.

21:11.720 --> 21:15.349
Hello. Can I sleep with you?

21:15.440 --> 21:19.228
What?!
- Mummy and Daddy let me sometimes.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.276
No. No, Josh.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.433
Go back to bed, please. That's a good boy.

21:31.320 --> 21:36.394
"Mummy and Daddy let me sometimes.''
- Sssh! Shhhhh!

21:37.440 --> 21:38.190
Please.

22:18.256 --> 22:21.593
Rach rang. I think they're making
real progress with Josh.

22:21.857 --> 22:24.057
He's even called two of
his toys Ellie and Olivia.

22:24.729 --> 22:26.435
Mind you, he keeps
pulling their heads off.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.553
That was Felix Bishop. His date's not well.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.631
They're not coming?
- She isn't.

22:33.720 --> 22:37.554
I mean, great to tell us
half an hour before they're due to arrive.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.030
Is that the time?
I must go and put some more make-up on.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.439
More?

22:43.520 --> 22:45.272
She already looks like a cheap tart.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.191
That is my mother you're talking about.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.872
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.632
Yeah. I take back ''cheap''.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.299
Felix and Robert are
due here within the hour

22:54.597 --> 22:56.236
and the only company I
can offer is your mother.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.958
We need another girl, don't we?

22:58.040 --> 23:03.273
Where are we going to find someone suitably
attractive and charming at such short notice?

23:04.360 --> 23:06.316
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.157
Thank you very much, but I'm going
out tonight.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.515
What?
- Sorry.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.318
How about Rachel?

23:16.400 --> 23:19.358
What? And leave Josh alone with Adam?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.271
Actually, I know someone.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.235
Have you eaten, love?
- No. Not yet.

23:27.320 --> 23:30.869
Do you fancy a curry? I'm doing one for
myself, but I could always do a bit more.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.996
Yeah, all right. Go on, then.

23:33.280 --> 23:36.397
It's working out quite well,
this living apart together, isn't it?

23:38.160 --> 23:41.470
And it'll save you money.
Which, given your situation...

23:41.560 --> 23:43.516
I start a new job tomorrow, Pete.

23:46.200 --> 23:48.873
Oh. Every little helps, doesn't it?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.597
Do you think I should still look
for somewhere else or stay here?

23:53.680 --> 23:56.592
Pete...I don't know.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.878
I don't want an answer now.
Wait till the end of the month.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.430
Or, better still, start of next month,

24:04.520 --> 24:08.069
we could sit down, have a chat,
see what the future holds.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.832
What? Whether you should be my lodger?

24:11.360 --> 24:12.554
Whatever.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.557
All right. We'll see how it goes.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.518
Great! Great!

24:19.640 --> 24:23.269
One minute to Coronation Street.
Should we have tea in the lounge?

24:23.360 --> 24:25.316
Good idea. Hello?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.470
Oh, hello.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.831
Yeah. All right. Yeah. Yeah.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.196
That'd be great.
Give us five minutes, I'll get changed.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.748
See you later. All right. Bye.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.957
Listen, forget about that curry.
Dinner at David and Karen's.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.996
Oh, what? Now?

24:43.120 --> 24:45.475
Oh, well.
I suppose we could always tape the Street.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.516
Not you. Just me.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.356
You don't mind baby-sitting, do you?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.789
You know I said I was doing a boat?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.871
It's a dinosaur now.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.795
Oh, bollocks!

25:07.840 --> 25:09.876
Still seeing who can burp the loudest?

25:09.960 --> 25:13.191
Well, no, I was under the impression
that someone didn't approve,

25:13.280 --> 25:15.669
so we're doing something educational now.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.399
What's Adam been teaching you, Josh?
- Bollocks.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.319
Excellent. We'll continue this
in the morning.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.231
It's way past your bedtime.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.880
No. Not yet.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.916
Do you know what, Josh? This is really good.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.911
It is, isn't it? Yeah.
- Brilliant.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.558
Is it yours?

25:32.640 --> 25:34.631
Yeah.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.790
Come on, you two. Bed. Now.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.518
Up we go.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.238
God. Women, eh?

25:40.320 --> 25:42.117
Yeah.

25:42.200 --> 25:48.639
<i>Anteater walks into a pub, right?
Walks up to the bar, orders a pint of bitter.</i>

25:48.720 --> 25:52.349
The barman pulls him a pint,
puts it down in front of him.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.034
He says, ''All right, sir?'' He says, ''Yeah. ''

25:55.120 --> 25:58.715
He comes back later, and he says,
''Is everythlng all right, sir?''

25:58.800 --> 26:00.756
The anteater said, ''Yeah, it's fine.''

26:00.840 --> 26:03.593
And he goes away.
He comes back a couple of minutes later.

26:03.680 --> 26:06.399
And he says, ''Are you sure
everything's all right, sir?''

26:06.480 --> 26:10.917
And the anteater says, ''Yes, it's fine.
I wish you'd just leave me alone.''

26:11.000 --> 26:14.072
And the barman says,
''Oh, well, why the long face, then?''

26:15.600 --> 26:18.160
Excuse me.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.838
Man walks into a pub.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.310
The same pub?
- The same pub.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.719
Hi.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.518
Jenny! What brings you here?

26:29.600 --> 26:32.831
I thought I was invited for dinner.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.516
Of course. Yes, of course. Come in.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.919
Right.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.916
Sorry. Yes, come in.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.074
Right. Jenny, let me introduce you
to everyone.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.230
Er...this is Felix.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.276
Felix Bishop.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.678
The pleasure's mine.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.318
<i>And this is Heather...</i>

27:00.360 --> 27:02.430
..who's Karen's mother.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.352
And this is Robert...

27:09.040 --> 27:11.076
..who works with Felix.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.194
Jenny is... Jenny's a friend of ours.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.430
Available at no notice.

27:18.520 --> 27:20.875
David...

27:20.960 --> 27:23.952
Right. Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll just erm...

27:26.440 --> 27:28.032
Felix was just telling a joke.

27:29.120 --> 27:31.634
Jokes? Great.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.352
You invited Jenny?!

27:35.440 --> 27:37.351
Oh, is she here already?

27:37.440 --> 27:40.830
The last time we invited her, she emptied
a fire extinguisher over my boss.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.876
David, we haven't got fire extinguishers.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.918
This is supposed to be a dinner party,
not a business function.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.355
Well, we'll be talking business.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.390
Briefly.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.835
I know another one...
- What do you chaps do, then?

27:54.920 --> 27:57.593
Let me guess. Second-hand cars?
- Internet.

27:57.680 --> 28:02.310
Oh, bugger. Sorry.
It's just...at least I know what a car is.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.551
I'm the same. I can't even turn
a computer on.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.876
Is that your job, then, Robert?
- Er, no. It's my company.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.190
Right.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.748
So, do you work for him or...

28:15.840 --> 28:18.638
Felix is what's known as an incubator.
- Yeah. I bet he is.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.829
What he does, right, is...he looks for people
with a good idea, like me, then exploits us.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.355
Exploits the idea.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.830
I raise the money to make it happen.
- Oh, is that it?

28:31.920 --> 28:34.115
Do you know how much he's worth?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.236
I dunno. Internet...

28:38.320 --> 28:40.311
Got to be...20 million pounds!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.830
That was last week. Try 30.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.233
I hate having to pander to these people.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.959
I've had to work hard to achieve...all this.

28:57.040 --> 29:02.831
Robert just switches on his laptop and bingo!
He's a multimillionaire. There is no justice.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.638
What's your point exactly?

29:04.720 --> 29:08.793
They're looking to appoint another firm of
consultants and we're in with a shout.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.839
We were, but with the charm offensive
in the hands of your mother and Jenny,

29:12.920 --> 29:16.276
I might as well log off now.
- David, I'm sure they'll behave.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.635
Oh, I'm absolutely starving.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.318
Thanks for inviting us...Karen.

29:21.400 --> 29:24.472
It's lovely to see you.
- Hey, that Robert's a bit of all right.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.794
David, there are people dying of thirst
in here.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.671
And he's filthy rich.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.876
What the hell? I might just have
a crack at him.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.672
Thank you.

29:39.760 --> 29:43.070
Now...David. Here's a thing.

29:43.160 --> 29:49.030
Did you know that ''mother-in-law''
is an anagram...of ''woman Hitler''?

30:01.440 --> 30:07.037
And ''middle-aged man'' is...
''reactionary old fart''.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.351
No, it's not.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.192
No, there's no F in ''middle-aged man''.

30:13.280 --> 30:17.831
There's no effing wine left either, David.
Get some more will you, darling?

30:21.000 --> 30:25.755
I...er...I was just wondering
if I'd left any aftershave behind.

30:25.840 --> 30:31.312
Allright. So, at ten at night with your child asleep
in bed, you thought you'd pop over and check?

30:31.400 --> 30:32.958
Interesting.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.951
Is that so unbelievable?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.918
Given your record for personal hygiene?

30:38.760 --> 30:41.957
Actually, I...I just need someone
to talk to.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.519
Pete.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.909
Hmm. That was lovely.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.716
Can I ask you a personal question?

30:52.800 --> 30:55.360
What's it like to be a millionaire?

30:55.440 --> 30:57.590
It's the first question I'm asked by women.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.148
What's the second?
- Am I gay?

31:00.240 --> 31:02.879
Are you?
- That's for you to find out.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.151
What is it like, then?

31:06.240 --> 31:08.276
I'm only a millionaire on paper.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.828
I didn't think you'd carry that
much cash on you.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.831
And no, I'm not gay.

31:12.920 --> 31:17.391
And the answer to your next question is...
no, I'm not seeing anyone at the moment.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.552
I wasn't going to ask you that.
- You'd have asked David.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.676
God, you're very confident.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.475
I guess that is what being
a millionaire's like.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.471
Only on paper.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.154
What's wrong with you?
Why haven't you got a girlfriend?

31:30.240 --> 31:32.549
I ain't got much time for women.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.551
I mean...

31:34.640 --> 31:38.519
I haven't got much time, you know,
what with the business.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.149
Married to your work.
- But one day I'm hoping to get a divorce.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.957
The thing with
most management consultants, Felix,

31:49.040 --> 31:52.953
is when they know they've got your business,
they don't try as hard.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.999
They put in a junior team.
Faces change from meeting to meeting.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.790
Now, at DZQ, we believe that building
relations is vitally important.

32:03.800 --> 32:09.033
Speaking of relations, David,
what's your mother-in-law's situation?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.596
I think Felix likes me.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.352
Yeah. I wonder whether Dad would like him.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.396
I've left your father, Karen.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.837
<i>Sorry, I hope you didn't mind me
bringing little Adam along.</i>

32:27.920 --> 32:32.311
No. No. Josh is usually up around this time.
- Yeah. He wets his bed.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.551
Playing with little Adam might take
his mind off it.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.956
So?

32:40.600 --> 32:45.799
So...I think...me and Jenny
might be getting back together again.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.759
Karen mentioned
something about your husband.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.478
Been asking questions?

32:54.560 --> 32:56.516
No... No.

32:56.600 --> 33:01.435
His name's Pete. And, at the moment,
he's at home with our little boy.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.111
Right. I see.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.873
You probably don't. We're separated.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.793
Not very effectively.
We live under the same roof, but...

33:10.880 --> 33:12.438
Separate beds?

33:13.480 --> 33:15.232
That's a very personal question.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.276
And I'm very sorry.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.155
Separate bedrooms, actually.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.433
Would you like some more coffee, you two?

33:24.520 --> 33:26.750
I think we'd better.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.751
Do you think I'm mad?

33:28.840 --> 33:32.799
Maybe I'm misreading the signals, but since
I moved back in, we've been getting on well.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.189
Is that how Jenny sees it,
that you've moved back in?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.158
She calls me the lodger.
But that's just a running gag.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.037
Well, where is she tonight?

33:41.120 --> 33:42.712
Dinner at David and Karen's.

33:42.800 --> 33:46.588
We weren't invited.
- Oh, no. It's a last-minute thing.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.830
They needed a single woman
to make up numbers.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.036
But is Jenny a single woman?

33:51.120 --> 33:53.031
Er...maybe not for much longer.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.908
We said we'd sort out our living arrangements
at the beginning of next month.

33:57.000 --> 34:01.630
I'm quietly confident that I won't be sending
out any change of address cards.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.751
So where did you park the Porsche, then?
- Over there.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.429
Blimey! I was only joking.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.512
Right.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.149
Jenny...can I see you again?

34:28.639 --> 34:30.835
Ha! It's my designated driver.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.911
Ready to hit the road?

34:34.679 --> 34:36.636
I should go. See you.

34:36.719 --> 34:38.676
Jenny...

34:39.920 --> 34:42.228
Was it something you said?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.358
Whoops!

34:55.880 --> 34:57.029
Mum...

34:57.120 --> 34:59.076
Not now, Karen.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.871
Thanks for listening, fellas.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.315
It's nice to hear someone else's
take on things.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.709
Don't jump to conclusions too quickly, Pete.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.711
Oh, come on, Rach.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.076
Adam's right.
I think we know Jen a bit better than you.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.469
What's this?
- It looks like dog hair.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.516
We haven't got a dog.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.355
Josh!

35:36.920 --> 35:38.638
Oh, my God!

35:40.240 --> 35:43.073
Well, I must say, that went better
than expected.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.913
Robert and Jenny hit it off.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.310
And Felix seemed very taken
with your mother.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.868
She's left my dad.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.996
What?!
- Apparently.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.196
She hasn't said why yet.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.952
Darling, that's terrible.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.389
So, she'd be free to see Felix again.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.792
David! My mother has left my father.
- That's my point.

36:06.880 --> 36:09.189
So how do you think that makes me feel?

36:10.360 --> 36:12.271
What about my dad?

36:12.360 --> 36:16.194
Yeah. I'm sorry, darling.
That was very thoughtless of me. Poor Jack.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.475
David, you don't even like him.

36:18.560 --> 36:21.677
No, But I wouldn't wish a failed
marriage on him.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.990
Not even if it's good for business?
- No.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.593
No, of course not.

36:38.680 --> 36:40.796
We can't take him home looking like this.

36:41.320 --> 36:43.880
Maybe if we brushed his hair across...

36:43.960 --> 36:45.951
What? Like Jackie Charlton?

36:46.040 --> 36:47.996
Bobby, actually.

36:48.560 --> 36:50.949
All right. We could cut a bit off
the other side.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.632
What would be the point of that?

36:52.720 --> 36:56.235
At least it would look symmetrical!
People might think it's a fashion.

36:58.040 --> 37:01.430
God! You know, it's got to look better
than this.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.079
Oh, my...!

37:08.160 --> 37:11.869
Funnily enough, it doesn't. Give them here.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.269
It's not bad. Just the one error.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.276
Oh, sorry. I did... I did check it.

37:23.360 --> 37:25.032
Looks all right to me.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.270
No. See? You got this bit wrong.

37:27.360 --> 37:30.875
Oh, no, actually. You did.
- I'm sorry?

37:30.960 --> 37:33.428
Well, ''to kindly wait'' is a
split infinitive.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.670
It should be '''I would ask you
kindly to wait.''

37:35.760 --> 37:39.196
That suggests I'm asking him kindly,
whereas in fact the opposite's true.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.908
It suggests you would ask him
to kindly wait. - Precisely.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.468
Pardon?
- To kindly wait. Change it, please.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.518
Right. It's just it's grammatically
incorrect.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.750
Change it!

37:53.520 --> 37:55.476
Geraldine Hughes.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.310
Is your name Jenny?

37:59.400 --> 38:00.913
Yeah.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.558
Er...hello?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.359
You never answered my question.
- What?

38:07.440 --> 38:08.998
About seeing you again.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.593
Who's this?

38:10.680 --> 38:12.636
Robert...Brown.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.751
We met at Karen and David's last night.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.355
Oh, right. Hello, Bob.com!

38:19.440 --> 38:21.556
Erm...hang on a sec.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.358
Sorry, it's personal.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.078
How did you find me?

38:25.160 --> 38:27.071
I rang your temp agency.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.913
Very reluctant to give out your number.
I used all my charm.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.558
What? And that was enough?

38:31.640 --> 38:33.631
I had to pretend I wanted to employ you.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.190
Well, thank you very much, but I have a job.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.510
Erm...excuse me for butting in.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.352
But that's where you're wrong.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.078
Hang on a sec. I'll just be a minute.

38:43.160 --> 38:47.790
Good. All the sooner you can change
this letter, get your coat and go!

38:55.680 --> 38:57.033
Hello.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.839
Are you free for lunch?

38:59.920 --> 39:01.876
Erm...

39:03.000 --> 39:05.560
As it happens, I think I might be.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.518
I had no idea you and Dad were unhappy.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.716
We haven't been getting on for some time.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.677
The drinking's been a problem.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.671
Well, I had noticed.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.352
No, not me! Him.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.351
Dad's drinking?

39:20.440 --> 39:23.318
Why don't I know about any of this?
- I'm telling you now.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.113
You've your own life.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.954
Do you want us on the phone every few days,
complaining about each other?

39:30.800 --> 39:33.360
We've had a good run. 35 years.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.114
And maybe half of them were happy.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.156
Don't talk like it's over.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.795
Do you mind if I stay
with you and David just for a while?

39:43.880 --> 39:46.235
Just till I've thought things through?

39:46.320 --> 39:48.834
Mum, you're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

39:48.920 --> 39:52.515
Just promise me
you'll try and sort things out with Dad.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.116
Oh, look at those shoes!

39:57.880 --> 40:00.952
Do you think they're the sort of thing
Felix might like?

40:04.080 --> 40:08.631
Mum and Dad'll be excited to see you.
They're gonna love us!

40:10.520 --> 40:11.794
<i>Joshy!</i>

40:11.880 --> 40:14.917
Hello, Ramona. Are David and Karen in?
- Yeah.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.956
That's...a pity.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.758
Heather, you're looking good.
Something special?

40:21.840 --> 40:23.398
Dinner with Felix Bishop.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.391
Really?

40:25.480 --> 40:27.357
Excellent!

40:28.080 --> 40:33.029
I mean...erm... Ahhh! Look who's here.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.269
Hello, darllng.
- Hello, Joshy.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.193
Big lad.
- What a lovely new hat.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.158
Yeah. There's a reason for that, Karen.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.110
So, how did they react?

41:03.200 --> 41:05.873
Pretty well, really. All things considered.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.554
Apart from Ramona. Latin blood. Mad.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.394
Olive oil?
- Oh, yeah. Extra virgin olive oil.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.151
Yeah. That's the one.

41:17.240 --> 41:18.878
Jenny was cool as well.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.474
I thought she'd go mad
when the ink wouldn't come out.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.118
Yeah, I bet you did.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.714
Does that papaya feel ripe to you?

41:25.800 --> 41:27.472
No.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.710
No...Yeah.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.951
She just smiled and said,
''There's more important things in life.''

41:33.040 --> 41:35.270
You could take that as an encouraging sign.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.590
Oh, I do. I do. Now, smoked salmon.

41:37.680 --> 41:40.797
Norwegian wild or Scottish farmed?

41:40.880 --> 41:43.440
What are we doing here?

41:43.520 --> 41:45.750
Tomorrow is a very significant day.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.556
May 7th?

41:48.640 --> 41:50.949
Quince jelly...

41:55.400 --> 41:59.109
Joshy, your little sisters have
a surprise for you.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.350
Do you want to see what it is now?

42:01.440 --> 42:03.396
Go on!

42:04.040 --> 42:05.758
Wow!

42:05.840 --> 42:07.796
<i>Wow!</i>

42:07.880 --> 42:09.871
It's a present from the girls.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.075
Great!

42:12.680 --> 42:17.470
That was Karen. Apparently,
Josh thinks his sisters are wonderful.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.632
You mean David's bought him off?
- Yeah, it sounds like it.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.076
They're storing up trouble.
Spoiling him now.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.116
Mm. Rod for their own backs.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.548
I think we handled the wee lad quite well.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.790
We did, didn't we?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.791
Firm but fair. That's the secret, you know.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.916
Establish your boundaries and stick to them.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.117
Except when you gave him all that chocolate.
- That was different.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.115
I don't know how. But it was.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.270
It was hell having him here though,
wasn't it?

42:51.360 --> 42:53.316
It was a nightmare.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.470
Just imagine that 24 hours a day.

42:55.560 --> 42:57.073
Drive you mad.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.596
It is quiet without him, isn't it?

43:04.560 --> 43:05.515
Hmm.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.998
I think I miss him.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.718
Do you?

43:13.800 --> 43:15.631
Well, no...you know, I mean...

43:15.720 --> 43:17.312
I miss him too.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.353
What?

43:26.440 --> 43:29.238
What?
- You were going to say something.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.629
Oh...yeah.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.278
Oh, no, forget it.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.196
Well, it's just that...

43:46.360 --> 43:50.114
No...no...no. It's a crazy idea.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.714
Us?
- Yeah.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.392
Do you want to?

43:54.480 --> 43:57.836
Do you?
- It's a hell of a decision to take.

43:57.920 --> 44:00.070
Unless you don't take it.

44:00.160 --> 44:04.073
You know...just leave things to chance.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.638
And you wouldn't mind?

44:12.760 --> 44:14.716
No.

44:21.280 --> 44:24.033
I'm glad you said that, because...

44:24.120 --> 44:27.908
you know our special friend
that comes to stay now and again?

44:28.000 --> 44:30.833
Pete?
- No, my period. It's late.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.070
How late?

44:33.160 --> 44:35.628
A week or so.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.118
Oh, my God!

44:39.200 --> 44:42.078
Yeah. Well...

45:38.560 --> 45:41.028
May 7th.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.636
Oops!

45:54.280 --> 45:58.273
Da-da! Happy anniversary, Jen. Ha-ha!

45:58.360 --> 46:00.271
Oh, God!

46:00.360 --> 46:04.353
Look. I kinda thought that we
wouldn't be celebrating this any more.

46:04.440 --> 46:07.159
Well, why not?
We're still together. After a fashion.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.756
Well, yeah. But...

46:10.840 --> 46:14.310
Oh, come on, love. Sit down. Your
salmon and scrambled egg's getting cold.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.958
We've got loads to discuss.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.951
Look, Pete, I'd...

46:21.600 --> 46:23.556
Hang on a sec.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.560
Look, Pete, this is too much. It really is.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.796
I didn't send those.

46:42.520 --> 46:43.714
Hello?

46:45.280 --> 46:48.033
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've just got 'em.

46:48.120 --> 46:53.478
Yeah, listen, I can't really talk, to be
honest. Yeah. Oh, they're lovely.

46:53.560 --> 46:55.152
Let me give you a ring.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.118
I'll give you a ring in about half an hour.
