with Captain Buck.

Okay, thank you.

do that. Hold!

01:31.091 --> 01:33.127
More than that.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.828
I'm sorry.

still gonna have to come

Hello, Jules.

What perfect

talking about you.

I'm Eve Miller.
Hello.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.507
Eve reads your
column. Religiously.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.042
Well, I write it
the same way,

02:22.109 --> 02:24.878

that I don't say
something stupid.

Uh, perhaps we should...

No.

I'll summarize.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.363
You know, you're
a fine writer,
Ms. MacGruder,

to the topic of when
to take a chance on love,

well, your opinion is...

(LAUGHING)

You know,
forgive me,

Excuse me. Lovely
to meet you. Bye.

Hey, Mandi,
did I get a letter

03:17.531 --> 03:19.900
from someone
named Eve Miller?

03:19.967 --> 03:22.503
Not that I remember.
Why? Who is she, anyway?

03:22.570 --> 03:25.839
(SIGHING) That's what
I intend to find out.
Would you do me a favor?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.207
Run down to
the mailroom

03:27.275 --> 03:28.342
and see if they know
anything about it.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.710
Sure.

Oh. And, Mandi?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.648
On your way back,
stop at the kitchen
and get me some aspirin.

You're absolutely right.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.792
That's a nice change.
About what?

03:44.858 --> 03:48.095
Passion. It should always
be tempered with caution.

03:48.161 --> 03:52.400
Especially when deciding
whether or not to take
a chance on amore.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.569
Are you speaking from
personal experience?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.205
It's none of your business.

03:58.272 --> 04:02.209
Anyway,
your columns have
been excellent lately.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.077
Seems to be
a minority opinion.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.413
What?

04:05.479 --> 04:07.348
Uh, nothing.
Mmm.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.384
So you came all the way
down here just to give me
a pat on the back?

04:10.451 --> 04:11.952
No. I came all
the way down here

04:12.019 --> 04:14.388
to tell you that in addition
to writing the "Heart Healer,"

04:14.455 --> 04:16.357
you're gonna be covering
fashion and accessories

04:16.423 --> 04:18.358
while my staff writer's
on maternity leave.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.027
Why me?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.963
Because it's your
old job and that should
make it easy for you.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.698
But I don't
have the time.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.933
Hey, Nora.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.338
King.

04:30.404 --> 04:34.675
Well, perhaps if you
tempered your own passion,
you'd find the time.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.285
I ran into Mandi
in the coffee room.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.954
She said you were
gonna need these.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.088
Yep.

04:49.056 --> 04:53.361
Look, Nora may be your boss,

04:53.427 --> 04:55.896
but you still shouldn't
let her push you around.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.432
Too late.
Well, in that case,

04:58.499 --> 05:01.535
I would prescribe
either two of these,

05:03.471 --> 05:05.172
or one of these.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.513
Do any good?

05:12.580 --> 05:16.350
Not sure. Try again.
Maybe up the dosage.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.651
Ah!

05:18.118 --> 05:19.319
Yeah.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.800
That's better.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.036
To avoid relapse,
we should probably
sweep off your desk

05:36.103 --> 05:38.005
and move on to the
next level of therapy.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.807
It's exactly that
kind of temptation

05:39.873 --> 05:42.142
that led to the
fashion writer's
maternity leave.

05:42.209 --> 05:45.012
And, in turn,
to my headache.

to run out to the university.

from a friend in New York.

06:08.101 --> 06:12.205
He said my name came up
at a board meeting
for the Times recently.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.708
Which means what, exactly?

06:14.775 --> 06:17.911
Don't know, but
I'll keep you posted.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.386

to yell at the mailroom

do any good?

he's a little
too old for you?

none of my business.

"weird"? What sounds
weird about that?

negative by it.

these years apart,

from knowing how
to be a decent mom.

I give you
some advice, then?

an "S" in front of it.

so passionate
about the game.

can have a shelf life.

12:07.895 --> 12:10.898
And a time
to be passionate.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.165
Good answer.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.938
And what time
would you say
it is now?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.884
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

12:31.952 --> 12:33.520
(PHONE RINGING)

12:38.425 --> 12:40.861
(EXCLAIMS) Like a
beacon in a storm.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.263
(CHUCKLING)
You are a lifesaver, Mandi.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.998
Were you up late?

12:45.065 --> 12:47.868
Late enough to need
a bellhop for these bags.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.537
You have an interview
for the fashion section
in five minutes.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.105
And Nora called.
She wants your leads

12:52.172 --> 12:54.474
for your upcoming
columns ASAP.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.444
Would it be wrong
to put out
a hit on Nora?

12:57.510 --> 12:58.611
Yeah.
Wrong.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.080
(LAUGHS)

13:00.147 --> 13:01.314
All righty, then.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.416
Do me a favor.
Get in touch with
Eve Miller for me.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.686
The lost-letter lady?
Mmm-hmm.

13:06.753 --> 13:09.890
Tell her I'm ready
to take her up
on her offer.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.464
PEYTON: Did you
have that follow-up
conversation with David?

13:18.665 --> 13:20.300
This morning.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.071
And?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.874
He's still
over baseball.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.679
Would you like me
to talk to him?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.281
Oh, that'd be fan...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.186
...tastic.

13:39.252 --> 13:43.023
What'll be fantastic?
If I speak to David,
or my dress?

13:43.090 --> 13:45.492
Both. With the
emphasis on the dress.

13:45.558 --> 13:46.793
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

13:48.828 --> 13:50.063
Wow.

13:51.731 --> 13:55.368
You become more beautiful
every time I see you.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.237
Thank you.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.672
Champagne?
What's the occasion?

13:59.739 --> 14:03.043
Well, I just thought
a pre-theater cocktail

14:03.110 --> 14:05.812
might be a nice start
to the evening's
festivities.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.681
My, but you're
winning brownie points.

14:15.388 --> 14:20.627
And also to
soften you up

14:23.663 --> 14:25.265
for this.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.002
Oh, King...

14:29.069 --> 14:30.503
What do you think?

14:33.740 --> 14:36.443
That's gorgeous.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.445
Like the woman
I hope will accept it.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.248
Hey, I'd get down
on one knee,

14:41.314 --> 14:44.417
but too many sports
injuries preclude
that possibility,

14:44.484 --> 14:48.788
so I will just come
right out with it.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.223
MacGruder...

14:51.024 --> 14:52.359
Sorry.

14:53.593 --> 14:58.165
(CHUCKLES)
Peyton,
will you marry me?

15:02.169 --> 15:06.573
You know that
I love you, right?
You do know that?

15:08.508 --> 15:14.014
I know that, and if your
next sentence is gonna
start with the word "but,"

15:14.081 --> 15:16.549
I'd like to cash in all
the brownie points I got
for bringing the bubbly,

15:16.616 --> 15:19.619
and any others
I might've earned over
the last nine months.

15:19.686 --> 15:24.091
Save them. Just let me
think about it, okay?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.894
What's there
to think about?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.931
Well, there's
Christine,
for one thing.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.666
What about her?

15:33.733 --> 15:36.469
Well, she's fragile.

15:36.536 --> 15:41.074
She's trying to be
strong, but, you know,
she's really struggling.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.177
The kid's lost
both the people
who raised her.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.547
I'm all she has left,
and we barely
know each other.

15:49.216 --> 15:52.185
I don't want
to seem insensitive,

15:52.252 --> 15:56.189
but how does our getting
married affect that?

15:58.258 --> 16:02.529
I don't know. I...
That's one of the things
I need to figure out.

16:14.774 --> 16:20.447
Kingston, thank you
for thinking me worthy
of being your wife

16:22.449 --> 16:24.817
and for loving me
enough to ask.

16:27.054 --> 16:30.423
And for having the
patience to wait
for an answer?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.977
(BOTH LAUGHING)
CHRISTINE: Come on.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.113
(MIKE EXCLAIMS)
No, I put my
hand there first.

16:53.180 --> 16:56.049
That's mine.
I'm sorry, that's mine.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.850
(EXCLAIMING)
Come on.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.152
(LAUGHING)
I'm winning.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.321
Oh, I'm out of control.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.757
(EXCLAIMS) That's
because you're cheating.
Look at that.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.194
That's not fair,
that was mine.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.429
(MIKE EXCLAIMING)
I put my hand
down first.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.498
What about that?
Yeah...

17:15.768 --> 17:17.036
Hello?

17:18.238 --> 17:19.506
Oh. Um...

17:19.571 --> 17:22.275
Perfect timing!
I was actually just
about to call you.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.876
Uh-huh?

17:23.943 --> 17:26.479
Course catalog
came from State and
I checked with Admissions.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.946
They said that since
I'd already enrolled,

17:28.013 --> 17:29.149
you know, before
the plane crash,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.151
that I don't need to reapply.

17:31.218 --> 17:34.020
That's cool, huh?
Very cool.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.922
Oh, you remember
Mike, right?

17:35.988 --> 17:39.759
Of course.
Hey. Great
to see you again.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.629
Listen, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.033
Oh.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.968
Oh, yeah,
not a problem.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.104
I got some
stuff in the back
I gotta do anyway.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.273
Just give me a holler
if a customer
comes in, okay?

17:53.340 --> 17:54.407
I'll take care
of them.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.608
Okay.

17:58.145 --> 18:01.013
Jeez, what's
so important?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.683
King proposed
to me last night.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.218
Wow!

18:05.285 --> 18:07.053
Did you say yes?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.522
I said I'd have
to think about it.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.291
Well, that makes sense

18:11.358 --> 18:12.625
'cause you guys
have only been seeing
each other seriously

18:12.692 --> 18:14.461
for like a couple
of months now, right?

18:14.527 --> 18:15.762
Nine months.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.064
Well, I mean, that's
still not an eternity.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.334
I've left clothes
at the dry cleaner
for longer than that.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.036
I know. It came as
a surprise to me, too,
that he was ready

18:24.103 --> 18:28.441
to make such
a big commitment,
but I do adore him.

18:28.508 --> 18:33.079
Well, what's not to adore?
I mean, King's a really
great guy. I just...

18:34.581 --> 18:35.582
What?

18:35.648 --> 18:37.083
I don't know.
Nothing.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.587
Come on, now. Spit it out.
Tell me what you're feeling.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.526
I guess I'm just
a little bit afraid

18:46.593 --> 18:49.862
of getting squeezed
out of the family
portrait again.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.498
Oh, Christine.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.503
Whatever happens
between me and King,

18:56.569 --> 18:59.038
it'll never change
the love I have for you.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.974
Right. No,
of course.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.778
I'm just being selfish.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.747
It's gonna be great.

19:09.616 --> 19:13.119
And whatever you
decide is cool. Really.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.664
Peyton. I was just
coming to see you.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.666
I need leads.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.268
Yes, I know.

19:30.136 --> 19:34.173
How about a follow-up on the
caution-versus-passion piece?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.643
What kind of a follow-up?

19:36.709 --> 19:40.747
A new angle on the
right time to take
a chance on love.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.181
New angle?

19:42.249 --> 19:45.117
Opposing opinion.
From a reader.
Mmm.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.654
Flesh it out.
Get back to me.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.021
(SIGHS)

19:53.025 --> 19:57.430
Mandi, tell me
you've gotten in touch
with our friend Eve.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.900
If I told you that,
I'd be lying.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.437
Do you still have
the envelope that
the letter came in?

20:06.939 --> 20:09.108
Good. There's
a return address.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.177
Okay, if you're not
able to get in touch
with her today,

20:11.244 --> 20:14.213
I will stop by
to see her tomorrow.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.382
Okay.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.655
Hey.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.190
Hey.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.592
I enjoyed the
play last night.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.261
Oh, me, too,
especially
the last act.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.331
(CHUCKLING) You slept
through the last act.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.399
My point exactly.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.267
(LAUGHING) Come in.

20:35.568 --> 20:40.072
So, any news?
On the decision front?

20:40.139 --> 20:42.975
King, you proposed to me
less than 12 hours ago.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.244
What? That's
not enough time?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.389
I told Christine.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.426
And?

20:59.492 --> 21:01.561
She did her best
to act happy about it,

21:01.628 --> 21:03.930
but I think the idea
of sharing me with you

21:03.996 --> 21:05.998
really has her
pretty freaked out.

21:06.065 --> 21:10.202
You don't think you're
reading more into this
than there really is?

21:12.472 --> 21:15.207
Maybe. I mean,
I don't know.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.011
I'm just building
my relationship with her

21:19.078 --> 21:22.181
and I'm terrified to do
anything to damage it.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.150
Right.

21:24.216 --> 21:27.587
I think that
we should both

21:27.654 --> 21:30.557
give our full attention
to the kids right now.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.291
Solidify our
relationships,
you know,

21:32.359 --> 21:35.995
and then we can
move on to re-focusing
on ourselves later.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.098
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

21:39.165 --> 21:42.969
Oh, it's David.
Returning my text.
He's on for lunch.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.504
Great.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.940
Oh.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.109
Hey, my buddy
from New York called.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.979
It turns out that
the Times is looking
for a new sports editor.

21:53.045 --> 21:56.516
Apparently, I'm
on the short list.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.919
Is that something
you'd consider?

21:59.986 --> 22:03.656
(SIGHS) Look,
the short list is
not an offer.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.625
Let's not worry about it
until we have to, okay?

22:05.692 --> 22:06.926
Now go.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.194
Solidify my relationship
with David

22:08.260 --> 22:11.498
so you and I can
move on to re-focusing.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.073
PEYTON: Thanks for
taking the time to have
a sandwich with me.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.543
DAVID: First lesson
I learned in college,
never pass up a free meal.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.612
(CHUCKLES)

22:25.678 --> 22:27.980
Not entirely
free, I'm afraid.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.716
You are gonna
have to listen
to my third degree

22:29.782 --> 22:32.218
about why you
quit baseball.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.653
I figured that's
what this was all about.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.423
Mmm.

22:36.489 --> 22:40.593
David, I don't care
whether or not you play.

22:40.660 --> 22:44.030
I really don't. I care
about you and your dad,

22:44.964 --> 22:46.298
and I'm worried
about you guys.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.267
What's to worry?

22:48.334 --> 22:51.037
You don't seem to be
able to communicate.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.439
He says that
you don't talk.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.840
You say that
he doesn't listen.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.409
Well, it's kind of
always been like that.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.778
Always?

22:58.845 --> 23:02.248
Well, since he and my mom
got a divorce anyway, yeah.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.382
Mmm.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.520
Do you think
maybe it's time

23:07.587 --> 23:10.590
that you got back
to what it once was?

23:10.657 --> 23:13.125
I mean, you don't have
to ignore what happened,

23:13.192 --> 23:16.829
but you don't have
to get hung up on it,
either, you know?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.465
Find some middle ground,

23:18.531 --> 23:21.668
build a new
relationship on it.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.970
You know, your
father would do
anything for you.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.338
Yeah, except pay my tuition.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.875
Did he say that?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.677
Well, not exactly. No.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.547
Well, anyway,
it doesn't really matter.
Not anymore.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.516
What does that mean?

23:38.217 --> 23:39.586
David?

23:44.356 --> 23:48.861
(SIGHING) I didn't
just quit baseball.
I quit school.

23:48.928 --> 23:49.929
You what?

23:49.996 --> 23:52.131
I'm not into it.
I haven't been all year.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.601
That's why my
grades are lousy,

23:54.667 --> 23:57.604
which is why they
cut me from the team.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.706
They cut you
from the team?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.440
Yeah, my dad's gonna
have a heart attack
when he finds out.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.875
But I don't care.

24:02.942 --> 24:06.479
This just isn't
my thing. Not anymore.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.351
So I said, "Okay,
what is your thing?"

24:12.418 --> 24:14.787
And you'll never
guess what he said.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.691
Art school.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.894
What?

24:21.961 --> 24:25.498
Art school. He wants
to go to art school.
In LA. CalArts.

24:27.667 --> 24:31.437
You gotta be
kidding. He wants
to be an artist?

24:32.505 --> 24:33.673
Yeah. What's
wrong with that?

24:33.740 --> 24:34.941
(LAUGHING)
It's ridiculous!

24:35.007 --> 24:36.876
That's what's
wrong with it.

24:36.943 --> 24:39.646
That is so knee-jerk.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.081
Give the kid
a chance, you know?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.850
You should
at least talk to him.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.187
Hey. Promise me.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.727
(SIGHS)

24:54.794 --> 24:57.229
Why is it

24:57.296 --> 24:59.331
I find it impossible
to say no to you,

24:59.398 --> 25:02.735
but you have
no trouble at all
saying no to me?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.075
All right,
Peyton...
Hmm?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.378
...I will talk
to David. I will.

25:12.444 --> 25:16.916
I'll even do my
best to stay calm.

25:16.983 --> 25:21.087
But you have
to promise me
something in return.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.724
That you'll think
about your relationship
with Christine.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.461
I know you feel
that you owe her
your full attention,

25:29.528 --> 25:32.464
and that's fine,
I understand.

25:32.531 --> 25:38.304
Just don't confuse
maternal obligation
with penance

25:38.370 --> 25:41.307
for having given her up
in the first place.

25:45.678 --> 25:49.548
Oh, jeez, MacGruder,
I didn't mean
to upset you.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.951
(SNIFFLING) You didn't.
It's just the smoke.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.355
Come here, then.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.157
(EXHALES)

25:59.926 --> 26:01.628
I'll protect you.

26:03.462 --> 26:06.866
Can you protect me
from myself while
you're at it?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.252
Ms. Miller?

26:27.186 --> 26:29.255
I see you found my note.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.795
If you want to punch
me in the nose,
Ms. MacGruder,

26:35.862 --> 26:38.698
you're gonna have
to come inside to do it.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.476
I'm sorry to just
stop by like this.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.112
I tried to call
several times.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.647
I was visiting my
daughter in Raleigh.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.716
Please, make
yourself at home.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.617
Thank you.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.688
You know, it's me who
should be apologizing.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.690
When we met the other day
at the paper, I was...

27:03.756 --> 27:05.324
Refreshingly candid.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.859
...unforgivably rude.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.294
(CHUCKLING)

27:08.360 --> 27:11.030
Well, either way,
you definitely left
an impression.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.131
That's why I'm here.

27:12.198 --> 27:15.501
Well, I'm delighted
that you are. Tea?

27:15.567 --> 27:17.236
Sure.
All right.

27:29.515 --> 27:33.585
Is this a picture
of your daughter?

27:33.652 --> 27:37.556
And those two precious
beauties with her
are my grandchildren.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.169
One of these guys
your husband?

27:50.236 --> 27:54.006
Yes. Billy's the one
with his arm around me.
Hmm.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.142
Is he a pilot?
Copilot.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.910
Ritchie Everby,
loadmaster.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.846
Ben Morrick, pilot.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.681
Rescue helicopters.

28:02.749 --> 28:06.352
They were still
in training in 1966
when this was taken.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.289
Are you two
still married?

28:10.356 --> 28:13.025
Billy died when
my daughter was four.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.261
I'm sorry.
Mmm.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.263
Was it in the war?
In Vietnam?

28:18.397 --> 28:20.666
Ben went.
Billy stayed behind.

28:21.734 --> 28:24.103
Why don't you have a seat

28:24.170 --> 28:28.474
and tell me a little
bit about yourself?

28:30.242 --> 28:36.082
All right. Well,
my husband passed away,
too, some time ago.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.784
Like you,
I have a daughter.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.151
With so much in common,

28:39.218 --> 28:41.153
I wonder why we find
ourselves at odds

28:41.220 --> 28:43.422
when it comes
to the question of
when to trust our hearts

28:43.489 --> 28:44.924
as opposed to our heads.

28:44.991 --> 28:48.160
Exactly what I'm
hoping to learn
by interviewing you.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.328
Interviewing me?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.831
Yes.
For the "Heart Healer,"
my column.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.599
It's an opposing
point of view.

28:53.665 --> 28:58.737
Oh, no, no, I'm not
interested in being
interviewed, Ms. MacGruder.

28:58.805 --> 29:01.673
But your note,
your invitation...

29:01.740 --> 29:04.043
For a discussion,
an exchange.

29:05.411 --> 29:06.445
An exchange?

29:06.512 --> 29:07.980
Stories,
life lessons.

29:08.047 --> 29:10.649
I mean, maybe even
a secret or two.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.788
But it's you
that my readers
will be interested in.

29:15.855 --> 29:19.358
Ah, but it's you
that will interest me,
Ms. MacGruder.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.895
Give-and-take.
That way, we both
gain something.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.096
Um...

29:25.832 --> 29:27.934
I'm afraid I misunderstood.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.538
Well, I'll still be here
if you change your mind.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.342
Thanks for your time.
Bye.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.294
No, but she wouldn't
agree to an interview.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.529
That's too bad.
Yeah.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.365
King's not in there.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.499
Where'd he go?

30:00.566 --> 30:01.868
I don't know.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.671
He did leave
an hour ago, though.

Hey, it's King. You've
reached my cell phone.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.247
Leave a message.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.716
King, it's me. Listen,
if you're gonna have
your talk with David,

30:17.783 --> 30:21.487
remember your promise.
Be cool, and call me.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.422
Or stop by later.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.461
Run down to the
paper's morgue.

you can find on Eve Miller
and her husband.

Okay.

Mom?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.882
Christine, what
are you doing here?

30:49.949 --> 30:52.218
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.087
Do you have a sec?
Sure.

30:55.154 --> 31:00.927
(EXHALING)
Okay. So I've been
thinking. A lot.

31:00.993 --> 31:04.496
About you, and me,
and King, and this
whole marriage thing,

31:04.563 --> 31:06.933
and I have to tell you,
I'm pretty stressed about it.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.235
Trust me, that
makes two of us.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.869
So did you decide
anything yet?

31:11.570 --> 31:12.638
No.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.041
Okay.

31:15.107 --> 31:19.211
Okay, well, what I
wanted to tell you was

31:19.278 --> 31:21.680
don't let me be
the thing that keeps
you and King apart.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.783
I mean, don't let me
or us or our relationship

31:24.850 --> 31:28.520
be the reason if you
do decide not to get
together with King.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.389
Just leave me
out of the equation

31:30.456 --> 31:32.058
because I can handle
you being married,

31:32.124 --> 31:34.726
but I can't handle
you resenting me.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.529
Okay?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.466
Yeah. Okay.

Okay. Good.

Yeah?

it's King. You've reached
my cell phone.

Wow. That was fast.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.203
It's just one file,
but it's thick.

From a wealthy family
out west, Charlotte.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.548
Banking money.
What about Eve?

32:29.615 --> 32:31.150
Another country-club type.

32:31.217 --> 32:35.554
Her father was a judge,
mother a social diva
in Chapel Hill.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.224
Is there anything else?

32:38.290 --> 32:42.394
A ton of stuff.
Apparently, she's
a pretty big-deal artist.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.296
Ceramicist.
Right.

32:44.363 --> 32:47.399
Oh, one child from
her marriage with Billy.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.536
I know. A daughter.
Did she ever remarry?

32:52.538 --> 32:57.109
No record of it here,
but there is a lot
more to go through.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.745
Yeah, you know what?
I'm gonna take
that home with me.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.222
I guess you told him, huh?
About our conversation?

33:10.289 --> 33:14.826
Your dad? Yeah.
You didn't tell me not to.

33:15.461 --> 33:16.662
Why? What happened?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.797
He freaked out,
that's what happened.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.866
He found me
at the field house
cleaning out my locker,

33:20.932 --> 33:22.168
and started
yelling at me,

33:22.234 --> 33:24.336
accusing me of having
a crappy work ethic,

33:24.403 --> 33:27.073
of blowing an
opportunity that
any kid would kill for.

I'm sure your dad
will understand.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.477
No, no. Don't
defend him, okay?

Because the reality is,
I don't care anymore.

of you has to say.

when I came home.
He was very upset.

you yelled at him
about his work ethic.

that you were gonna
give him a chance...

To explain why he wants
to go to art school.

No art school. Spare me.
I'm sure one of his buddies

34:38.643 --> 34:40.712
probably told him he'd
get to draw naked girls.

I'm not really sure
that I'm ready for it, so...

you're probably
out with King,

38:17.796 --> 38:19.665
Staying up all night,
drinking and partying

38:19.731 --> 38:21.700
with someone who is
way too old for you.
"Drinking and partying"?

38:21.767 --> 38:23.369
That's what's wrong with me.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.004
Is this the stuff that
you were so busy with?

38:26.071 --> 38:27.339
So what if it was?

38:27.406 --> 38:28.740
I think you're
acting out, Christine,

38:28.807 --> 38:30.342
in ways that are
self-destructive

38:30.409 --> 38:33.244
to get even with
your father for dying.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.447
That is totally insane.
Is it?

38:35.514 --> 38:37.549
Yes, it is.
I don't even drink.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.986
Oh, right.
Mike drank two cases
of beer all by himself.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.821
He was here with his band.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.856
They're cutting a demo,
so I let them rehearse
in the basement.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.124
They were working,
it wasn't a party.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.794
And then I made them
some food, okay?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.296
And as far as
being mad at my dad,
yeah, you're right.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.765
He picked a really
lousy time to die.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.134
And, yeah, okay,
I am mad,
but not just at him.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.704
I'm mad at my
adoptive mother
who died, too,

38:58.770 --> 39:00.539
and I'm mad at you,
who actually had
a say in the matter,

39:00.606 --> 39:03.809
and you still chose
to give me away.

39:03.875 --> 39:07.879
Now, if you're finished
judging me, I have to
get ready for work.

day of kindergarten?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.299
Who gave you
your first kiss?

40:01.366 --> 40:05.070
Did he break your heart
or did you break his?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.809
I don't know
the answers to those

40:10.876 --> 40:14.112
and about a thousand
other questions.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.648
I missed
so much of your life.

40:19.050 --> 40:22.387
Too much, maybe,

40:22.454 --> 40:24.690
because now that
I have the chance
to be the mother

40:24.756 --> 40:27.025
that I always
dreamt of being,

40:28.059 --> 40:30.562
I'm making a total
mess out of it.

40:33.331 --> 40:36.301
All that matters to me
is that you never stop trying.

40:39.104 --> 40:43.308
Unfortunately, I think
that's about the only
thing I can guarantee.

Yeah, come on in.

42:03.188 --> 42:06.558
So what made
you come back?

42:08.226 --> 42:12.030
I'm sort of
at a crossroads
in my personal life

42:13.431 --> 42:15.400
and somehow
I thought...

42:17.969 --> 42:20.471
(CHUCKLING)
I don't know
what I thought.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.173
Maybe that a view
with a perspective

42:22.240 --> 42:25.043
other than your own
might be useful?

Okay. Let's put our
cards on the table.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.152
I assume you did
some research on me.

Oh, I...
You'd be a lousy

All right.

Both you and your husband
came from well-to-do,

42:45.797 --> 42:48.299
politically-connected
families.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.869
Our mothers were
sorority sisters.

42:50.936 --> 42:53.672
Billy and I were
destined to be married,
at least in their minds,

42:53.739 --> 42:55.874
from the moment
we were in the womb.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.542
You studied art
at Davidson.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.911
Yes. Of course,
my father never thought

42:59.978 --> 43:02.247
that I'd ever be able
to make a living
selling my work,

43:02.313 --> 43:05.684
so he insisted on
a teaching credential,

43:05.751 --> 43:10.555
which brings us back
to this photograph

43:12.858 --> 43:15.126
and the story I wanted
to tell you when
I sent you my note.

43:15.193 --> 43:17.562
More tea?
No, I'm fine, thanks.

43:22.133 --> 43:25.470
Billy joined
the Navy when he
graduated from Duke.

43:25.536 --> 43:30.642
By the time he was
in flight school,
we were engaged.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.244
I followed him
to Newport News,

43:33.311 --> 43:37.182
where I got a job
teaching at a girls'
school near the base.

43:37.248 --> 43:41.186
He became very close
to his training crew,

43:41.252 --> 43:42.821
and when I arrived,
they very graciously

43:42.888 --> 43:45.456

He loved speed, danger.

He was always trying
to get the rest of us to
join him in some crazy stunt.

Like what?

44:33.671 --> 44:34.873
Well...

44:39.845 --> 44:41.646
There was this...

44:41.713 --> 44:45.717
There was this one
crispy, cold autumn day.

44:45.784 --> 44:47.618
It was a few weeks
before they were to ship out,

44:47.685 --> 44:52.057
and we all decided we'd
go for a hike in the woods
not far from the base.

44:52.123 --> 44:54.025
Ben, give it to me.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.962
Oh, almost
missed it, Ritchie.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.363
Get out of here.

45:00.598 --> 45:05.937
EVE: We came across
an old bridge that
went across a gorge.

45:06.004 --> 45:09.307
Ben couldn't resist
running ahead and
climbing up on the railing.

45:09.374 --> 45:13.344
The world-famous
tightrope walker, yawning
in the face of certain death.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.381
Naturally, he wanted
the rest of us to join him.

45:16.447 --> 45:19.484
Ritchie and Billy
were not moved
by his madness.

45:19.550 --> 45:23.154
I, on the other hand,
succumbed to the challenge.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.689
Billy was beside himself.

45:24.756 --> 45:26.758
Actually, I think
he was more concerned

45:26.825 --> 45:30.361
with how he was going to
explain my death
to my parents

45:30.428 --> 45:32.397
than he was
about my well-being.

45:32.463 --> 45:35.166
Of course, that made me
want to do it even more.

45:35.233 --> 45:39.304
Now, I was halfway
across and I stopped

45:39.370 --> 45:44.776
and foolishly glanced
down at the creek.

45:44.843 --> 45:46.544
It was a long way down,

45:46.611 --> 45:50.481
and I very nearly lost both
my footing and my courage

45:50.548 --> 45:54.519
until I glanced back at Ben

45:54.585 --> 45:59.925
and his outstretched hand,
and then up into his eyes,

45:59.991 --> 46:03.194
where I found
the gumption to continue

46:03.261 --> 46:06.898
until his fingers
wrapped around mine.

46:10.836 --> 46:13.538
Well, then we jumped down,

46:13.604 --> 46:15.807
laughing like
the lunatics that we were,

46:15.874 --> 46:18.343
and bowed as if we were
members of a circus troupe.

46:18.409 --> 46:23.614
Ritchie, he applauded
wildly, and Billy...

46:25.550 --> 46:28.119
Billy was so mad,

46:28.186 --> 46:31.222
he didn't speak
to me for near a week.

46:31.990 --> 46:34.059
You had a wild streak.

46:34.125 --> 46:37.062
Repressed by the world
in which I was raised.

46:39.564 --> 46:42.133
Whatever happened to Ben?

46:42.200 --> 46:47.472
Well, after he served
in Vietnam, he married
a Cambodian woman.

46:47.538 --> 46:52.043
Stayed in Asia,
flying mercy missions
for various charities.

46:52.110 --> 46:54.745
So when was the
last time you saw him?

46:59.450 --> 47:01.686
Well, I think we have
to save that story.

47:01.752 --> 47:03.054
You know,
my clay's drying out.

47:03.121 --> 47:04.822

47:04.890 --> 47:07.792
Why don't you bring
a couple of sandwiches
with you tomorrow for lunch?

We can continue this
with you telling me
about Gil.

my husband's name?

we're traveling
together, remember?

47:16.167 --> 47:18.436

of research myself.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.405
Your husband died
in a traffic accident.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.640
You were pregnant
at the time.

47:22.707 --> 47:24.675
You gave the
child up for adoption

47:24.742 --> 47:26.511
and you were reunited
last Christmas,

47:26.577 --> 47:30.015
after that terrible
airplane tragedy.

47:30.081 --> 47:31.950
How could you know
all of that about me?

you're involved

I'd be willing to bet,

47:51.069 --> 47:53.104
has something to do
with the crossroads

47:53.171 --> 47:55.540
that brought you
back to see me.

another opportunity
like this, Peyton.

pass it by if...

that you would
expect him to be.

51:34.425 --> 51:39.830
Handsome and charming
and rumpled and so smart.

51:39.897 --> 51:44.369
You must've had
plenty of competition,
then, for his attention.

51:44.435 --> 51:45.603
Let's just say
he did nothing

51:45.670 --> 51:48.606
to discourage
his popularity.

51:48.673 --> 51:53.211
And impending fatherhood,
how'd he deal with that?

51:53.278 --> 51:57.081
He tried at first
to get used to
the idea of it,

51:58.416 --> 52:00.185
but it didn't fit
his self-image.

52:02.187 --> 52:05.523
And then when
I began to show,

52:05.590 --> 52:08.058
he just became
more and more...

I don't know...

52:12.363 --> 52:14.131
Disengaged.

That's a word
I understand very well.

"Disengaged" is about
the best thing I can say

52:20.605 --> 52:23.174
about my relationship
with Billy.

52:23.241 --> 52:27.512
Our marriage was,
in essence, arranged.

52:27.578 --> 52:31.416
We respected
each other, but there was
very little affection...

52:31.482 --> 52:32.950
Hey.
...never mind love.

52:33.017 --> 52:34.385
Hey.
BEN: Gentlemen.

52:34.452 --> 52:35.720
Hey.

52:35.786 --> 52:37.222
You can have
the winner.

52:37.288 --> 52:39.224
In the meantime,
dance with Eve,
will you? She's bored.

52:39.290 --> 52:41.492
I can't handle her
staring daggers at me.

52:41.559 --> 52:46.063
EVE: Our lives were destined
to be rich with privilege,

52:46.130 --> 52:48.466
but totally devoid of passion.

52:51.569 --> 52:55.139
* Girl, you know,
you know how I feel

52:58.343 --> 53:01.812
* Babe, you got to know
my love is real

53:05.216 --> 53:09.287
* If you're unsure,
question me

53:11.989 --> 53:14.058
* I'll give you all my love

53:14.124 --> 53:17.328
* And that's how it's gonna be

53:18.996 --> 53:20.965
* You're the one I need

53:21.031 --> 53:24.235
* Come rain or shine

53:25.870 --> 53:28.038
* If you find the time

53:28.105 --> 53:32.777
* I'll make you mine

53:32.843 --> 53:37.315
* You are...

53:37.382 --> 53:40.318
EVE: Oh, Ben and I,

53:40.385 --> 53:43.888
we tried our best to
not become involved, but...

53:47.958 --> 53:51.462
Well, it was inevitable.

53:54.732 --> 53:58.736
But if it was Ben
you loved, how did you
end up married to Billy?

54:03.641 --> 54:07.044
Do you love...
What's his name,
your sports writer?

54:07.111 --> 54:09.246
Kingston, King.

54:10.047 --> 54:11.215
(CHUCKLING)

54:11.282 --> 54:13.784
Just saying his name
makes you smile

54:13.851 --> 54:15.820
and yet you can't
bring yourself
to marry him.

54:15.886 --> 54:17.288
Why is that?

54:19.290 --> 54:24.028
Did you ever write
to Ben, you know,
after Billy died?

54:24.094 --> 54:27.097
There was no point.
I mean, not after
Ritchie told me

54:27.164 --> 54:28.833
he'd married
another woman.

54:28.899 --> 54:31.336
But when was that?
It was the '70s.

54:31.402 --> 54:35.440
It's so long ago.
You know, maybe...
It doesn't matter.

54:35.506 --> 54:38.609
Even if I wanted to,
I wouldn't know how
to begin to find him.

54:38.676 --> 54:42.713
I wouldn't know
where to begin looking,
not after all these years.

54:53.190 --> 54:55.560
Oh.

54:55.626 --> 54:56.961
I must've picked
this one out for you

54:57.027 --> 55:00.698
when I was what,
six years old?

55:00.765 --> 55:04.068
I can't believe
that you wore
this one to work.

55:05.470 --> 55:07.738
PEYTON: How do we
make forward progress

55:07.805 --> 55:11.876
when the past weighs on us
like Marley's chains?

55:11.942 --> 55:15.513
With what tool can we
cut those onerous bonds?

55:15.580 --> 55:17.648
Therapy? Confession?

55:17.715 --> 55:22.186
Or perhaps, more simply,
with a candid dialog
between trusted friends.

55:22.252 --> 55:24.589
I've found such
an opportunity recently

55:24.655 --> 55:27.725
with a woman whom I have
come to greatly admire,

55:27.792 --> 55:32.830
one of you, dear readers,
who wrote to oppose
my admonition to be cautious

55:32.897 --> 55:35.299
when opening
one's heart to love.

55:35.366 --> 55:38.503
I'm beginning to be persuaded
by her point of view,

55:38.569 --> 55:44.509
and as her argument continues
to unfold, I hope to share it
with you in this column.

55:44.575 --> 55:47.244
Okay, so I talked
to a yeoman first class,

55:47.311 --> 55:49.747
whatever that is, at the
Veterans Administration.

55:49.814 --> 55:52.383
Very, very sexy voice,
by the way.

55:52.450 --> 55:55.352
I'm betting that
he has a ship tattoo
right on his...

55:55.420 --> 55:58.022
Mandi.
Sorry.

55:58.088 --> 55:59.957
Bottom-line it, please?
All right.

56:00.024 --> 56:03.628
The last time the Navy
made any contact with
Ben Morrick was in 1974.

56:03.694 --> 56:07.798
They sent his
discharge papers to
an address in Chiang Mai.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.900
Thailand?
Mmm-hmm.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.669
Okay.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.604
This is gonna be
a long shot, but
what the heck.

56:13.671 --> 56:14.805
I pulled these off the Net,

56:14.872 --> 56:16.306
a list of nongovernmental

56:16.373 --> 56:18.175
organizations
operating in Asia.

56:18.242 --> 56:21.311
Start calling them.
See if anybody's ever
heard of the guy.

56:21.378 --> 56:22.513
Okay.

56:24.849 --> 56:28.352
There are fewer
names in the Beijing
telephone directory.

56:28.419 --> 56:32.156
Well, who knows?
Maybe the first one
will be the lucky winner.

56:32.222 --> 56:35.325
If not, I'll give you
a hand when I get back.

56:38.162 --> 56:39.430
(DOORBELL RINGS)

56:40.364 --> 56:42.032
Be right there.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.303
(EXHALES)

56:50.040 --> 56:52.443
Hey, come in.
Thanks for coming over.
Hi.

56:52.510 --> 56:55.946
Your message made it
sound important.
What's all this?

56:56.013 --> 56:59.817
It's stuff for the
homeless shelter.

56:59.884 --> 57:01.552
Your dad's stuff?

57:02.186 --> 57:03.353
Yeah.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.022
I decided it was time
to get my head straight.

57:05.089 --> 57:06.957
About a lot of things.

57:09.093 --> 57:12.362
I can't tell you how
proud that makes me.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.965
Oh, but that's not
why I called you.
No?

57:15.032 --> 57:16.934
No. Mike's
bass player, Ricki,

57:17.001 --> 57:19.604
let it slip that
David's been crashing
on his hide-a-bed.

57:19.670 --> 57:21.405
Said he's supposed
to keep it quiet

57:21.472 --> 57:22.607
'cause he's trying
to avoid his dad
or something?

57:22.673 --> 57:23.608
Who's been
worried sick.

57:23.674 --> 57:25.242
Yeah, that's
what I figured.

57:25.309 --> 57:28.546
Anyway, he got
himself a gig at this
one-hour photo place.

57:28.613 --> 57:31.816
This is the
address right here.

57:31.882 --> 57:33.951
Great. Thank you,
Christine.

57:34.018 --> 57:35.019
You're welcome.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.122
Oh, Mom?

57:38.188 --> 57:41.191
Don't let David know
that I'm the one that
dimed him out, okay?

57:41.258 --> 57:43.861
Don't worry.
I never reveal a source.

57:58.475 --> 57:59.910
Any luck with the NGOs?

57:59.977 --> 58:02.412
I thought you'd never ask.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.149
You found him?
You found Ben Morrick?

58:05.215 --> 58:09.219
Seemed like I talked
to every dot-org in Asia
to do it, but, yeah.

58:09.286 --> 58:12.156
By the way,
you might want to
give Nora the heads-up

58:12.222 --> 58:14.625
about the gigundous
phone bill that's
about to come her way.

58:14.692 --> 58:15.793
I'll do that. Tell me.

58:15.860 --> 58:17.895
Okay. On about
the 50th phone call,

58:17.962 --> 58:21.165
I spoke with an NGO
who he'd flown with
for nearly 10 years.

58:21.231 --> 58:25.302
Apparently,
his job was to shuttle
orphans and sick people

58:25.369 --> 58:27.805
and medical supplies
in and out of
remote areas.

58:27.872 --> 58:29.774
Mission outposts,
that sort of thing.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.076
So is he still
in the jungle, or what?

58:32.142 --> 58:34.144
If you consider
Washington the jungle,

58:34.211 --> 58:36.146
'cause a lot of people do.

58:36.213 --> 58:37.715
He's in DC?

58:37.782 --> 58:40.484
Just outside.
He retired there
six months ago.

58:40.551 --> 58:43.287
You got all this
from one phone call?

58:43.353 --> 58:46.123
Guy I spoke with
at the non-profit
home office in Hong Kong

58:46.190 --> 58:48.759
was very friendly,
invited me for dim sum.

58:48.826 --> 58:51.295
Well, did your new friend
offer up an address?

58:51.361 --> 58:52.897
Indeed he did.

58:52.963 --> 58:54.665
You're gonna have
to take your act

58:54.732 --> 58:55.833
on the road,
though, if you
want to talk to him.

58:55.900 --> 58:58.002
No e-mails,
phone's unlisted.

58:58.068 --> 58:59.403
Hmm.

58:59.469 --> 59:02.306
You, young lady,
deserve a raise.

59:04.642 --> 59:05.810
Oh!

59:05.876 --> 59:08.478
Feel free to mention
that to Nora, too.

59:13.651 --> 59:16.486
Hey, what a surprise.

59:16.553 --> 59:19.023
Usually only
fire marshals

59:19.089 --> 59:20.825
and fitness freaks
use the stairs.

59:20.891 --> 59:23.160
I stopped by your office.

59:23.227 --> 59:25.763
I thought maybe
you'd gone up
to New York again.

59:25.830 --> 59:27.097
Not yet.

59:28.999 --> 59:33.103
Anyway, I'm glad I found you.
I need to talk to you.

59:33.170 --> 59:34.238
Really?

59:34.304 --> 59:35.572
About David.

59:35.640 --> 59:37.742
David? What about him?

59:37.808 --> 59:42.713
Christine found out
where he's working.
It's a one-hour photo place.

59:42.780 --> 59:45.182
(SIGHING) He's all right?

59:45.249 --> 59:47.484
Far as I know, yeah.

59:47.551 --> 59:49.620
I'm gonna
call his mother.

59:50.320 --> 59:51.521
King?

59:51.588 --> 59:52.690
Yeah.

59:53.991 --> 59:56.627
I was reminded of
something recently.

59:56.694 --> 59:57.962
What's that?

59:58.028 --> 59:59.496
In order to have
a chance at success,

59:59.563 --> 01:00:02.800
you need the courage
to face potential failure.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.739
David has the strength.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:12.109
He just needs to know
that, win or lose,

01:00:12.176 --> 01:00:14.078
you'll still be
there for him.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:21.686
Peyton, why can't you
tell me what's really
keeping us apart?

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:51.615
Eve.

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.385
I'm so glad I caught you.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:57.321
No, I'm just
running off
to the gallery.

01:00:57.387 --> 01:01:00.691
I won't keep you.
I've got the greatest news.

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:04.561
I found Ben Morrick.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:08.065
And the best part,
he lives less than
200 miles from here.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:09.566
It's near Washington.

01:01:09.633 --> 01:01:12.703
No, I'm sorry. No, I...
I've got to go. Sorry.
I've...

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.538
Eve, wait a minute.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.206
Eve.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:21.746
What happened
to the two-way street?
The give and the take?

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.547
You know, we were both
supposed to get something

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.015
out of this, remember?

01:01:25.082 --> 01:01:28.652
So far, all I've gotten
is more confused than ever.

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:31.621
Please, call me.
You know the number.

01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.572
Mr. Morrick?
Yes?

01:02:22.639 --> 01:02:23.808
Ben Morrick?

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.575
That's right.
Can I help you?

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.812
I sure hope so.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:32.049
Nice place you've
got here, Mr. Morrick.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.417
Your flowers are beautiful.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.986
Thanks. Call me Ben.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:38.555
My wife got me
into gardening.

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:42.192
She said it would be
the yin to the yang
of flying choppers.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.361
Mmm. Sounds like
a wise woman.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.930
She was indeed.

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:49.733
She passed away.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.635
Three years ago.
I'm sorry.

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.172
So, tell me...

01:02:55.239 --> 01:03:00.510
Tell me what brings
you all the way up
from Middleborough.

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:03.480
What could a reporter
possibly want with me?

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:07.451
Eve Miller sent me a note.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:11.822
Eve?
Mmm.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:15.792
She wrote to complain,
actually, about
a column I'd written.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.062
What kind of column?

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.930
On relationships.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:24.534
Specifically, I was
discussing when to
take a chance on love.

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:28.272
And her note led to
several conversations,

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:31.808
in which she told me
about Ritchie, Billy and you.

01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:34.444
What exactly
did she tell you?

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:38.148
About how you had all
trained together and
the friendship you shared,

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:40.851
and how you once
encouraged her

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:43.921
to cross a gorge
on the railing
of a bridge.

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:46.723
(CHUCKLING)
"Gorge" is a bit
of an overstatement.

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.525
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.361
She implied it was
a dangerous step for her.

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:53.497
Both literally
and figuratively.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.203
She said the two of you
got close after that.

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:04.841
It was a long time ago.

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:14.284
You knew that
she and Billy got
married, I assume?

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.453
Ritchie Everby told me.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.956
We ran into
each other in Saigon.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:22.492
He said Billy's father
had pulled some strings

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:25.896
and got him
a posting stateside

01:04:25.963 --> 01:04:28.933
as a wedding present.

01:04:28.999 --> 01:04:31.401
Were you surprised
by their marriage?

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.770
Yes and no.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:37.807
It was certainly what
their families wanted
for their own agendas.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.878
Still, it was
hard to believe
that Eve would...

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:46.683
She was so curious.
I mean, so full of life.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:51.055
And Billy, he was
just the opposite.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:53.790
She deserved...

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.160
What?

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:58.963
More than Billy
was capable of offering.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.302
But there was nothing
you could do or say, right?

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:07.604
I mean, Billy was
your best friend

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:10.474
and she'd already
agreed to marry him.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.842
It's quite a dilemma.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.013
Yes, quite a dilemma.

01:05:17.781 --> 01:05:20.184
So how did you resolve it?

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.687
In the worst way
imaginable, I'm afraid.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:27.591
What did Eve tell you?
About how it ended?
Between us, I mean?

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:31.428
She was vague.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:34.831
Which is why
I'm here, probably.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.834
I guess I'd like to have
your perspective on it.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:43.007
She did lead me
to believe, Ben,

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:46.343
that she still regrets
not following her heart.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.279
So what happened?

01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:58.222
Just a few days
before I left for Nam...

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:00.290
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:05.729
...the rainshower had
rolled in from the ocean,

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.932
and I was driving through it

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:17.007
when I saw Eve
riding her bike
down the road.

01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:19.243
(HONKING)

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.261
I knew I shouldn't
have stopped.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.397
I knew what would happen.

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:45.502
But I somehow
convinced myself

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:48.438
that we would be forgiven
our transgressions,

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:51.541
that we could ignore
our obligations.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.343
You gotta let me
talk to Billy.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.146
Let me tell him
we didn't mean
to fall in love...

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:57.647
No.
...that it
just happened.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.615
No.
I'll make him
understand.

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:00.184
You'll see, Eve.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.622
You can't tell him, Ben.
Not now, not ever.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:06.956
Eve...

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.063
Eve.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:17.701
BEN: If only we were
willing to risk everything
for an abiding love.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:21.838
Unfortunately,

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:27.544
Eve didn't have it in her
to take that chance.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:31.448
You never saw her
again after that day?

01:07:32.682 --> 01:07:35.252
I wanted to.
Desperately.

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.856
But the choice
wasn't mine to make.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.025
It was hers.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:46.696
You knew Billy
got killed, right?

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:48.865
A sailing accident.
Years ago.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.405
I didn't know.

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:17.627
Eve's phone number.

01:08:19.296 --> 01:08:21.631
Unfortunately,
Ms. MacGruder...

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.470
Peyton,

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:28.772
it's still her
choice to make.

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:50.627
Can I help you?
Maybe.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:53.197
I'm David Danville's father.
I called yesterday.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.232
They said he might be
working here tonight.

01:08:55.299 --> 01:08:58.033
Yeah, he's
in the darkroom.
You can go on back.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.368
Okay, thanks.

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:08.612
David?

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.916
Hey.
Hey.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.657
Look, for some reason,
you and I seem to be

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.591
on different
wavelengths lately

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:25.595
and I just want
to get past that.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:26.895
Okay.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.865
Okay, so talk to me,
why don't you,

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.568
about this whole
art-school concept.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:32.769
There's nothing
to talk about, really.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:35.104
I'm going,
end of story.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:38.006
You expect to pay
your tuition working here?

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:40.176
I expect to pay
for my plane ticket
working here.

01:09:40.243 --> 01:09:43.680
I'll figure out
the rest when
I get to LA.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.448
Where's all this
coming from
all of a sudden,

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.884
this newfound passion?

01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.353
It's not
all of a sudden.

01:09:49.419 --> 01:09:50.920
No?
No.

01:09:50.987 --> 01:09:53.457
It's something
I got started
with a while ago,

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:57.327
after you and Mom...
You split up.

01:09:57.394 --> 01:10:01.831
It was kind of
a distraction for me
from all that...

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:03.967
From all that
stuff going on.

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:07.771
Yeah, those were tough
times for everybody,

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.707
especially you.
I know.

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:16.179
What I regret most
about the whole thing

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:20.550
is the gap it put between us

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:24.020
that I still haven't
been able to bridge.

01:10:24.087 --> 01:10:26.690
I could have done better.

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:29.859
I should have done better.

01:10:32.696 --> 01:10:35.465
And for that failure,
I am truly sorry.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.805
If you want to go
to art school

01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:43.640
and draw pictures,
that's fine by me.

01:10:43.707 --> 01:10:47.911
I will support you
in every way I can.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:53.783
Okay. Cool.
Cool.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:11:00.223
And just so you know,
it's not drawing
that I'm into.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:01.658
No?

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:03.593
This is...

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.362
This is what I do.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.671
You took these?

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.406
Yeah. Well,
they're not all
that good, but...

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.675
Not good?

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.009
(CHUCKLES)

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.547
They're amazing.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:29.152
Amazing enough
to get me into
CalArts, anyway.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.287
I mean, who knows,
if you can win
the Pulitzer,

01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:33.390
maybe it's in the genes.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:40.630
Wow, somewhere
along the way I seem
to have forgotten

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:44.000
what an incredible
kid you are.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:49.172
If you can forgive
your old man for that,

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:55.545
I promise it will
never happen again.

01:12:00.384 --> 01:12:01.518
How could you
have done that?

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:02.752
How could you have
taken it upon yourself...

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.788
How could I not?

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.324
After everything
you told me about losing
the love of your life

01:12:08.392 --> 01:12:10.794
because you
weren't brave enough
to follow your passion.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.396
And yet
all these years later,

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.164
when I offer you
a second chance,
you what?

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:16.600
You still don't
have the courage?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.167
You know,
you don't understand.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:21.571
You keep saying that.
What don't I understand?

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:23.840
My daughter is his daughter.

01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:28.478
She's not Billy's child,
she's Ben's.

01:12:30.847 --> 01:12:32.849
Of course she is.

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:35.519
Of course.

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:43.092
By the time
I realized I was pregnant,
Ben had been shipped out.

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:45.795
It was an election year,

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:51.968
and my father was running
on a platform of what
we now call family values.

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:57.240
I didn't know how Ben
would take the news.

01:12:57.306 --> 01:13:01.010
So I chose caution
over passion.

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.946
Eve, that was
40 years ago.

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:05.649
What's left to
hold you back now?

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.318
I stole Ben's child from him.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.221
Raised her with
another man's name.

01:13:12.288 --> 01:13:15.324
What could I possibly
expect from him
after all these years?

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:19.095
How could I begin to explain?
Where would I find the words?

01:13:21.465 --> 01:13:25.301
In the same place
that I found the words
to tell my child

01:13:25.368 --> 01:13:29.238
that I tried
to take her life
along with my own.

01:13:29.305 --> 01:13:32.642
And when I failed
and she was born,
I gave her away.

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:37.146
I found the words.

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:41.184
What strength that
must have taken, Peyton.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:47.491
And yet, you're not
brave enough to commit
your heart to King.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.127
I can't help but wonder why.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.002
Because I'm a...
No.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:03.172
Don't tell me. Tell him.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:12.549
PEYTON: More than
four decades ago,
my critic and new friend

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:16.953
chose a well-marked path
rather than risk following
an unblazed trail.

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:21.290
Her regret at having
made that choice
had lasted a lifetime.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:23.392
And when,
after all these years,

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.995
fate offered her
another chance to choose,

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.731
a do-over, if you will,

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:31.801
she balked because
of a long-harbored secret.

01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.184
(SIGHS)

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.405
Hello, Ben.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:57.220
After that day
in the rain, I was
confused about what I...

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:03.292
What we'd done,
about who I was,
who I wanted to be.

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.831
It took me a while
to sort it out,

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.901
to realize that the love
I felt for you was real.

01:16:11.968 --> 01:16:13.937
And by the time
I came to tell you...

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:16.072
You came to tell me?

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:18.174
Rode my bike.

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:20.610
Didn't bother
slowing down
at the gate

01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:22.578
and got arrested
by the Marines.

01:16:22.646 --> 01:16:24.380
(CHUCKLES)

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:29.152
But not before I made it
to your quarters

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:34.557
and found out that
you had left that
morning for Vietnam.

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:36.693
Why didn't you write, Eve?

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:41.297
I would have,

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:46.102
but I found out
the next day

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:50.940
that I was pregnant.

01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:53.276
Pregnant?

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.911
You were gone, Ben,

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:56.212
to the other side
of the world.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.314
I didn't know
what to do.

01:16:58.381 --> 01:17:01.284
I tortured myself
for days and then,

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:04.587
finally, I turned
in the only direction
I felt I could,

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:07.657
to the world in which
I'd been raised.

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:09.325
To Billy, you mean.

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:12.095
I decided that under
the circumstances,

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.532
to avoid a scandal,

01:17:16.599 --> 01:17:19.202
to protect our
families' reputations,

01:17:21.938 --> 01:17:24.774
that I would
go through
with the wedding.

01:17:30.613 --> 01:17:35.251
It was a cowardly
decision, Ben,
and one I regretted

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:37.020
even as I stood
in front of the pastor,

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:40.757
because you
were always there,
Ben, between us.

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:47.263
And then
when Billy died,
I tried to find you,

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:52.702
but Ritchie told me
that you had married
another woman.

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:56.272
I did everything I could
to get you out of my mind,

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.575
and I failed miserably.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:03.479
And then Peyton MacGruder
told me that she'd found you,

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:07.917
and I wanted to run away

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:11.220
because I didn't believe
I had it inside me
to tell you the truth.

01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.760
But here you are.

01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:21.230
(SNIFFLING) Yes.

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:33.042
Tell me everything
about your life
that I've missed.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:39.548
Ben, there's so much.

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.150
We have time.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.287
Start...

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:47.924
Start by telling me
about our child.

01:18:49.358 --> 01:18:53.462
Oh, Ben, you
have a daughter.

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.664
(LAUGHING)

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.466
Her name's Dawn.

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:05.809
And, not to make
you feel old, but
you've got grandchildren.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:07.210
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:12.215
Not just one,
but two.

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:15.919
PEYTON: Mandi,
have you seen King?

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:17.987
No. I've been
hiding out.
From who?

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:21.624
Nora. She's called me
at least three times
since my first latte.

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.427
She wants this
week's column,
and she wants it now.

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:27.196
Well, it's not
finished yet.

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:30.834
Hmm.

01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:37.941
Is today Friday?
All day.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:42.045
What time does
the morning flight
leave for New York?

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.147
About an hour ago.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.021
Oh, no.

01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.958
You okay, boss?

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.461
Book me on the first
flight to La Guardia.

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:00.163
What about Nora?
Stall her.

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:01.297
Me?
You.

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:03.132
How?
Don't know, don't care.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.880
Whoa!

01:20:16.946 --> 01:20:18.414
Where are you going
in such a hurry?

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:21.184
New York. I thought
that you were...

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.818
But they're
painting your office.

01:20:22.886 --> 01:20:24.520
It's part of the deal
I made with Nora

01:20:24.587 --> 01:20:25.922
so I wouldn't
go to the Times.

01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:30.126
Course, I didn't tell her
I already passed on the offer.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:31.427
You turned it down?

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:32.495
Yeah.

01:20:33.897 --> 01:20:35.431
Can I come in?

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.166
Yeah, sure.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:45.041
Listen, I want
to hear why you
turned down the job,

01:20:45.108 --> 01:20:48.311
but there's something that
I really need to say first.

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:49.578
Okay.

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:52.315
You were right.

01:20:54.017 --> 01:20:57.153
About me using
Christine as an excuse

01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.789
to not commit
to you, to us.

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:03.759
Uh...

01:21:03.826 --> 01:21:07.897
I told you about
Gil and how we met.

01:21:07.964 --> 01:21:10.799
That he was your
professor, right?

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.202
And I was his
adoring student.

01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:18.407
And our relationship
was built on passion mostly,

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:22.178
and I was naive
enough to think that
that was gonna last.

01:21:22.245 --> 01:21:24.981
It didn't.

01:21:25.048 --> 01:21:30.119
When I got pregnant,
Gil became distant.

01:21:32.188 --> 01:21:35.891
Started finding excuses
to spend time away from home

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:40.396
and I just started
suspecting an affair.

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:45.334
I didn't realize.
I mean, I thought
you two were...

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.636
Desperately in love.
Yeah.

01:21:47.703 --> 01:21:49.405
I know.

01:21:53.376 --> 01:21:58.547
I confronted him
the night of the accident.

01:21:58.614 --> 01:22:01.150
I accused him
of betraying our marriage.

01:22:01.217 --> 01:22:05.888
He denied it, of course.
But we screamed at each other.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:10.026
We said vile things that
I'm just never gonna forget.

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:16.665
(SNIFFLING) And then
he walked out into the rain
and I never saw him again.

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:21.337
Was it true?
What you thought?

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:26.309
Less than a month
after I buried him,
I got a letter.

01:22:26.375 --> 01:22:28.511
One of his grad students
looking for absolution

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:30.813
for the affair that
she'd had with him.

01:22:30.879 --> 01:22:33.416
I'm sorry.

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:38.321
She said that
he had ended it
with her that night,

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.658
and that he was
on his way back here

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:45.494
to beg for my forgiveness.

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.098
But he slid off the road.

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:58.841
I just stopped
trusting my heart then.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:04.280
I was afraid that
the passion you feel
for me would disappear

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:06.882
like it did with Gil,

01:23:06.949 --> 01:23:08.951
and I just couldn't
face that again,

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:11.654
no matter how much
I love you.

01:23:14.357 --> 01:23:18.261
(EXHALING) But now...

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.429
What?

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:26.635
Having just
seen firsthand
a lifetime of love

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:29.872
squandered because of fear,

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:34.243
I decided I couldn't
let that happen to us.

01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:37.380
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:46.289
So, tell me, why did you
turn down the job?

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.657
I had to.

01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:51.060
I started fantasizing
about your pantyhose

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.829
drying on my shower curtain.

01:23:53.896 --> 01:23:56.632
What?
I know.
Weird, huh?

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:58.734
I kept imagining
my last razor

01:23:58.801 --> 01:24:02.338
being used to shave
your gorgeous legs.

01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:03.972
Started thinking about

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.542
how little
closet space
I actually need.

01:24:06.609 --> 01:24:07.610
(LAUGHS)

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:14.183
And I couldn't
conceive of a life
without you in it.

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:16.285
So...

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.626
Even if you
don't want this today,
Peyton, that's okay.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.395
'Cause I intend

01:24:26.462 --> 01:24:30.466
to propose every day
for as long as it takes

01:24:30.533 --> 01:24:32.401
until you feel
you are ready to say...

01:24:32.468 --> 01:24:34.069
Yes.

01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:40.276
Yes?
Yes.

01:24:40.343 --> 01:24:41.477
(CHUCKLING)

01:24:41.544 --> 01:24:43.346
Oh, my.

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:52.821
PEYTON: Eventually,
my friend overcame her fear

01:24:52.888 --> 01:24:55.023
and was rewarded
with an opportunity

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.361
to rediscover
her long-lost passion.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:02.231
The lesson she learned
from her experience
passed on to me,

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:05.768
and now to you,
dear readers, is this.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:09.838
Love is alive
and constantly evolving.

01:25:12.175 --> 01:25:15.311
Don't attempt
to understand it,

01:25:16.412 --> 01:25:18.214
or reason with it,

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:22.518
or defer it.

01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:26.021
We are gathered
together to witness
the exchange of vows

01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:29.758
between Peyton MacGruder
and Kingston Danville.

01:25:29.825 --> 01:25:32.728
Your love for each other
will grow deeper with
every passing day.

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:36.665
PEYTON: Or deny it
entry into your heart

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:40.403
with excuses molded
from doubt or insecurity.

01:25:42.405 --> 01:25:46.442
MINISTER: King,
will you take Peyton
to be your wife?

01:25:46.509 --> 01:25:51.180
Will you cherish
her friendship,
trust and honor her?

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:54.483
Be faithful to her
in sickness and in health

01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:56.385
as long as you
both shall live?

01:25:57.853 --> 01:25:59.121
KING: I will.

01:25:59.188 --> 01:26:02.958
MINISTER: Peyton,
will you take King
to be your husband?

01:26:03.025 --> 01:26:07.062
Will you cherish
his friendship,
trust and honor him?

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:10.132
Be faithful to him
in sickness and in health

01:26:10.199 --> 01:26:12.000
as long as you
both shall live?

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:15.037
I will.

01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:17.473
By the power
vested in me,

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.444
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.712
You may kiss the bride.

01:26:23.779 --> 01:26:28.617
PEYTON: Rather, when it
comes your way, grasp love.

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:32.355
Hold onto it
for all you're worth.

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:36.024
Never let fear
keep you from reaching
for life's bouquets.

01:26:36.091 --> 01:26:42.398
(ALL CHEERING)
And, finally, never ever fail
to take a chance on love.
