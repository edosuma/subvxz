only used to throw crab apples.

43:34.041 --> 43:35.791
Hey, Tommy, hey!

43:39.583 --> 43:41.541
-Mr. Dubois! [screams]
-[laughs]

43:41.625 --> 43:44.000
What the hell, Mike?
Why would you do that?

43:44.083 --> 43:46.916
Hey, whoa! I'm sorry.
Come on, I couldn't resist.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.250
[Tommy] That wasn't cool, man.

43:48.625 --> 43:49.875
Hey, coffee boy.

43:49.958 --> 43:51.375
You're that freshman, right?

43:52.166 --> 43:53.958
Uh, yeah.

43:54.041 --> 43:56.625
Yeah, well, welcome
to your first high school fight.

44:00.250 --> 44:03.458
Megan McNally, you like underclassmen?

44:04.583 --> 44:06.041
Oh, that's adorable.

44:06.125 --> 44:06.958
[Hubie] Hello!

44:09.583 --> 44:11.083
Is the fight over? Did I win?

44:11.666 --> 44:13.666
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you kicked his ass.
Come on.

44:14.791 --> 44:17.750
[Hubie] Is anyone out there? Sound off!

44:17.833 --> 44:19.333
[high-pitched voice] Help!

44:20.666 --> 44:24.041
Remain in place! I will find you!

44:24.666 --> 44:27.583
Not if I find you first! [snickers]

44:27.666 --> 44:31.708
Take me, evil one!
Just do not harm the child!

44:31.791 --> 44:33.333
[high-pitched voice] Help, Hubie!

44:33.416 --> 44:36.000
[snickering]

44:37.375 --> 44:38.875
No!

44:40.083 --> 44:41.666
Dad? Is that you?

44:42.791 --> 44:44.458
Does Mom know you're still alive?

44:45.833 --> 44:47.083
Are you still mad at me?

44:47.166 --> 44:49.750
No. It's Tommy, Violet Valentine's son.

44:49.833 --> 44:51.875
Yeah, and Megan.
I work down at the coffee shop.

44:51.958 --> 44:54.583
I give you free hot water
for your dehydrated soup sometimes.

44:54.666 --> 44:56.416
Yes. Much appreciated.

44:56.500 --> 45:00.250
The reason I take it for free
is 'cause I don't have money.

45:00.333 --> 45:03.791
Anyway, we came over here
to tell you that there's no lost kid.

45:04.500 --> 45:05.416
No one's lost?

45:05.500 --> 45:07.708
Yeah, it's just Mike Mundi
trying to pull a prank on you.

45:08.583 --> 45:09.791
Prank? No, I knew that.

45:11.916 --> 45:13.125
So, I like the costumes.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.083
-Garbage can?
-Yeah. Tin Man.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.916
And Red Riding Hood.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.958
I want to be honest with you.
Might not be a good year for it.

45:21.041 --> 45:24.875
Um, between us,
there is a man-wolf on the loose.

45:25.458 --> 45:28.333
Then maybe should I head inside?

45:28.416 --> 45:29.416
A wise decision.

45:29.500 --> 45:32.041
By the way,
my mom was talking about you tonight.

45:32.625 --> 45:34.041
Your mom was talking about me?

45:34.500 --> 45:35.541
What'd she say?

45:35.625 --> 45:37.208
Just that you are nice.

45:38.000 --> 45:38.833
Well, I am nice.

45:39.333 --> 45:41.958
Because I'm not gonna tell her
that you're out here playing Romeo

45:42.041 --> 45:44.208
instead of watching
your two little sisters.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.208
-Well, now I feel bad.
-I know you feel bad.

45:47.291 --> 45:49.625
-'Cause you got a big heart.
-Thanks.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.666
So, I'm gonna let
you two guys take off without me.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.666
I'll give you a head start
in the name of romance.

45:54.250 --> 45:56.791
-Okay. Go ahead, guys. Take care, now.
-[Tommy] Thanks, Mr. Dubois.

45:56.875 --> 45:58.833
-[Megan] Happy Halloween.
-Not looking, guys!

Same corn over and over.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.583
I should've left with the others,
'cause I have no idea where I am.

46:16.250 --> 46:19.333
So, I came from there.
I already was there.

46:21.708 --> 46:24.208
Can't believe I don't have
a compass on my thermos.

46:25.000 --> 46:25.875

-Hubie, I can't do this.
-Michael Mundi was abducted.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.458
I found a ticket
to the drive-in at the scene.

47:32.541 --> 47:33.583
Great. Start there.

47:36.041 --> 47:38.541
[Aurora] So, now's the time for us
big boys and girls

47:38.625 --> 47:39.958

47:40.041 --> 47:41.375

We're falling behind out there.

47:50.041 --> 47:53.541
Well, I was on the phone
with the credit card company.

47:53.625 --> 47:56.750
They didn't know I had an extension.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Tayback.

You know how much
credit card debt I'm in right now?

54:57.250 --> 54:58.875
Are we even going the right way?

55:03.166 --> 55:04.083
Excuse me, sir?

55:05.208 --> 55:07.375
Do you know
the quickest way to Wallace Orchard?

55:13.875 --> 55:16.708
-♪ It was Halloween night at the castle… ♪
-Hey, handsome. Soup's ready.

55:16.791 --> 55:20.583
One clam,
one chicken noodle, and one split pea.

55:21.083 --> 55:23.875
So, you seem a little stressed.
I mean, what can I do to help ya out?

55:23.958 --> 55:25.458
Maybe a glass of Chardonnay?

55:25.541 --> 55:28.166
Well, to be honest with ya,
I don't drink beer.

55:28.250 --> 55:30.333
But do you have any silver bullets?

55:30.416 --> 55:32.875
That is not on the menu tonight.

55:32.958 --> 55:36.708
But I happen to be an excellent listener
if you want to, you know,

55:37.333 --> 55:38.500
share anything with me.

55:39.333 --> 55:40.166
Okay.

55:41.458 --> 55:42.625
We all have a purpose.

55:43.291 --> 55:45.958
Some people's purpose is to
make sure all the streets are clean.

55:46.041 --> 55:47.083
Some people's purpose,

55:47.166 --> 55:49.958
like Kenny Rogers', is to make sure
there's great tunes on the radio

55:50.041 --> 55:52.166
that we can all
sing along with on road trips.

55:52.250 --> 55:54.083
Some people's purpose, like you,

55:54.166 --> 55:57.875
are here to make sure that kids
without parents end up with a mom anyways.

55:57.958 --> 56:00.875
Who is nice and kind to 'em
and makes them feel loved.

56:00.958 --> 56:03.041
-You happen to have any A1 Sauce?
-Yeah.

56:03.833 --> 56:04.708
My whole life,

56:04.791 --> 56:07.375
I felt my purpose
was to make sure everybody

56:07.458 --> 56:09.541
was safe and sound on Halloween.

56:09.625 --> 56:12.083
But tonight, I have failed massively.

56:12.166 --> 56:13.166
[thermos whirring]

56:13.250 --> 56:17.333
Because a fine young man
was abducted under my watch.

56:17.791 --> 56:19.625
-That's on me.
-No.

56:19.708 --> 56:20.708
Mmm.

56:20.791 --> 56:22.666
[turns thermos off]

56:22.750 --> 56:23.791
How can I help you?

56:25.875 --> 56:28.333
You just did help me
by listening to my story.

56:30.291 --> 56:31.375
Be careful today.

56:32.291 --> 56:33.416
Danger is afoot.

56:33.500 --> 56:36.708
Oh, well, I don't worry about me.
I worry about my kids.

56:36.791 --> 56:39.166
Called home. None of 'em picked up.

56:39.250 --> 56:41.875
They're probably just
watching a movie, though, and…

56:41.958 --> 56:44.000
-Tommy's keeping an eye on them.
-Tommy?

56:44.083 --> 56:46.500
I'm sure he's been there the whole time.
Without a doubt.

56:47.125 --> 56:49.750
The night is young.
Appreciate you being nice to me.

56:49.833 --> 56:51.250
Of course, Hubie.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.375
You're the best person I know.

56:53.916 --> 56:57.333
You're always thinking of
everyone else and never of yourself.

56:57.958 --> 56:59.833
But I guess that's why you're a hero.

57:05.208 --> 57:06.500
[giggles]

57:06.583 --> 57:11.458
Did you see how scared Scooby was
when that car started moving? [laughing]

57:11.541 --> 57:14.208
-With his ping-pong paddle at the ready!
-Oh, my God!

57:14.291 --> 57:15.958
What a buffoon!

57:16.041 --> 57:19.041
[mocking Hubie's voice]
Mr. Hennessy! Mr. Hennessy!

57:19.125 --> 57:20.208
[screams]

57:20.291 --> 57:21.250
[tires screech]

57:23.625 --> 57:25.083
There's somebody in the road.

57:26.500 --> 57:29.333
-Who the hell is that?
-It's not moving.

57:29.416 --> 57:30.791
Looks like a dummy.

57:30.875 --> 57:33.208
You look like a dummy.
Go out and get it out of the way.

57:34.375 --> 57:35.208
Okay.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.708
[puffs, inhales]

57:38.791 --> 57:40.416
Now, see, that does it for me.

57:40.500 --> 57:41.375
You like that?

57:42.000 --> 57:42.833
No.

57:45.250 --> 57:49.541
[open door alert dinging]

58:00.375 --> 58:02.458
[text keys tapping]

58:19.291 --> 58:20.208
Scarecrow?

58:21.958 --> 58:23.041
[Mr. Hennessy screams]

58:28.958 --> 58:29.791
Lester!

58:36.500 --> 58:37.333
Lester!

58:39.791 --> 58:41.875
I'm gonna kick your ass for this, Lester.

58:45.125 --> 58:47.666
I swear to God,
if you jump out of one of these bushes,

58:47.750 --> 58:49.416
I'm gonna punch you in the face!

58:57.291 --> 58:58.125
What the--

58:58.833 --> 58:59.666
Lester!

58:59.750 --> 59:00.916
[panting]

59:01.000 --> 59:01.958
Where are you?

59:02.041 --> 59:03.958
[screaming]

59:06.500 --> 59:08.500
[grunting]

59:09.541 --> 59:12.208
[Hubie]
Valentine family, where are you?

59:12.958 --> 59:13.833
I'm coming!

59:14.625 --> 59:16.416
Danielle! Cooky!

59:17.833 --> 59:20.958
I say, "Marco." You say, "Polo." Marco!

59:21.041 --> 59:21.875
[man 1] Weirdo!

59:22.750 --> 59:23.791
Marco!

59:23.875 --> 59:24.708
[man 2] Asshole!

59:26.041 --> 59:28.333
[fire crackling]

59:37.541 --> 59:41.541
[bare footsteps running]

59:43.250 --> 59:46.583
Hubie Dubois! Is that you?

59:47.375 --> 59:50.041
[Walter] Oh! You must be Mrs. Dubois!

59:50.541 --> 59:51.666
I'm Walter!

59:52.250 --> 59:54.416
Nice to meet you, Walter.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.750
It's a shame
what they've done to your lawn!

59:57.583 --> 59:59.208
Happens every year!

1:00:01.125 --> 1:00:02.000
[grunts]

1:00:02.166 --> 1:00:03.000
[panting]

1:00:03.083 --> 1:00:08.500
[grunting, shrieking]

1:00:09.583 --> 1:00:10.833
[gasps] Oh!

1:00:12.500 --> 1:00:14.333
[wailing]

1:00:14.416 --> 1:00:16.416
[grunting, screaming]

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.083
[handcuffs clicking]

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.583
Not tonight!

1:00:20.291 --> 1:00:22.958
[gasping, grunting]

1:00:23.708 --> 1:00:28.083
[panting]

1:00:37.541 --> 1:00:38.666
[sighs]

1:00:40.875 --> 1:00:41.875
We need to talk.

1:00:46.333 --> 1:00:47.458
[Tommy] They're not up here.

1:00:48.208 --> 1:00:49.708
[Megan] They're not down here, either.

1:00:50.541 --> 1:00:51.583
Danielle!

1:00:51.666 --> 1:00:52.833
Cooky!

1:00:52.916 --> 1:00:55.458
-We didn't find them.
-Hey! It's okay. We'll figure it out.

1:00:55.541 --> 1:00:56.958
-We'll find them.
-[pounding at door]

1:00:57.625 --> 1:00:58.458
[Tommy] Oh, no.

1:00:58.833 --> 1:01:01.083
[doorknob rattling]

1:01:04.166 --> 1:01:05.458
[creaking]

1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:13.416
[all screaming]

1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.500
What are we screaming at?

1:01:14.583 --> 1:01:16.125
[Tommy and Megan sigh]

1:01:16.208 --> 1:01:18.000
-Bam.
-Mr. Dubois, I screwed up.

1:01:18.083 --> 1:01:20.708
-I can't find my sisters.
-You don't know where the kids are? Huh.

1:01:21.375 --> 1:01:23.083
'Cause I do. They're right here.

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:25.041
-[girls] Tommy! Tommy!
-Oh, my God!

1:01:25.125 --> 1:01:27.458
I'm so sorry I left guys.
I'm so glad you're okay.

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:29.625
You are so cute with them.

1:01:29.708 --> 1:01:31.250
You have a girlfriend?

1:01:31.958 --> 1:01:34.541
I saw 'em coming through
the Old McMillan shortcut.

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:37.125
It was funny, 'cause not many people
know where that shortcut is.

1:01:37.208 --> 1:01:40.083
Just me and a friend of mine,
Richie Hartman. When I was a kid,

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:43.416
we used to finish our band practice
and shoot right through there.

1:01:43.916 --> 1:01:46.541
-Well, at least everybody's safe.
-No one in Salem is safe tonight.

1:01:46.625 --> 1:01:49.541
Do you understand me, Tommy? That's why
I'm putting this family on lockdown.

1:01:49.625 --> 1:01:52.500
Now, Tommy, you call your mother.
Let her know you're home.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:54.000
Megan, you call your parents.

1:01:54.083 --> 1:01:56.333
Let them know you're staying
at a friend's. That's for you.

1:01:56.416 --> 1:02:00.125
You two, do me a favor. Eat all the candy
you want, and then go straight to sleep.

1:02:00.708 --> 1:02:03.875
And lock this door!
No matter what, don't answer it!

1:02:03.958 --> 1:02:05.250
What're you gonna do, Mr. Dubois?

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:08.083
I'm gonna do what I do every October 31st.

1:02:08.166 --> 1:02:11.708
Make sure every citizen
in this town is safe and protected.

1:02:13.208 --> 1:02:16.875
Um, but do you have a bathroom
I could use? 'Cause I, uh…

1:02:17.666 --> 1:02:19.125
The soup kinda went right through me.

1:02:19.916 --> 1:02:21.333
Upstairs.

1:02:21.416 --> 1:02:23.250
Toilet? Is it a big toilet?

1:02:23.333 --> 1:02:25.458
'Cause I got a lot to do.

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:30.500
[howling in distance]

1:02:32.416 --> 1:02:34.625
[barking, howling]

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:36.750
I know that howl.

1:02:37.041 --> 1:02:38.625
[howling continues]

1:02:38.708 --> 1:02:39.625
Walter Lambert!

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.208
[howling continues, loudly]

1:02:45.291 --> 1:02:48.083
[girl screaming]

1:02:48.166 --> 1:02:50.833
[crowd chattering]

1:02:50.916 --> 1:02:53.875
[man laughing maniacally]

1:02:53.958 --> 1:02:55.875
[howling continues]

1:02:56.958 --> 1:02:58.750
The transformation is complete.

1:02:59.208 --> 1:03:00.333
[dog grunts]

1:03:01.291 --> 1:03:05.416
While I understand that you are
now a mindless killing machine,

1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:10.875
I would like to speak with the human being
that is deep down below your fur.

1:03:11.250 --> 1:03:12.458
[girl screaming in distance]

1:03:12.541 --> 1:03:13.458
Mr. Lambert.

1:03:13.541 --> 1:03:14.500
[dog grunts]

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:15.416
Walter.

1:03:17.125 --> 1:03:21.458
I cannot, in good faith,
allow you to hurt another soul tonight,

1:03:21.541 --> 1:03:24.791
even though this is Halloween,
and even though I know this is--

1:03:26.083 --> 1:03:28.666
Mr. Lambert, you're better than that.

1:03:28.750 --> 1:03:31.708
You-- Did you really wanna
defecate in front of me, sir?

1:03:32.916 --> 1:03:34.291
Oh, now, you're eating it!

1:03:34.375 --> 1:03:36.750
Is that Michael Mundi
you're eating right now?

1:03:36.833 --> 1:03:39.083
Is he inside your feces?

1:03:39.166 --> 1:03:42.375
-[barking]
-Mr. Lambert! Get over here!

1:03:42.458 --> 1:03:43.958

[man screaming]

1:03:45.958 --> 1:03:47.708
[Hubie's voice]
The only way to slay the beast

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:50.583
is a silver bullet right between the eyes.

1:03:52.375 --> 1:03:54.166
[hollering]

1:03:54.250 --> 1:03:55.583
Yo, dawg! That's my bullet!

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:56.541
[Hubie] Come here!

1:03:56.625 --> 1:03:57.625
[hollering]

1:03:57.708 --> 1:04:00.583
Oh! [panting, screaming]

1:04:00.666 --> 1:04:01.500
Mr. Lambert?

1:04:01.583 --> 1:04:02.916
[spooky theremin music playing]

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:03.833
Mr. Lambert.

1:04:05.416 --> 1:04:06.500
Mr. Lambert?

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000
[moaning, crying]

1:04:09.083 --> 1:04:10.541
Mr. Lambert.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:26.875
Mr. Lambert.

1:04:27.750 --> 1:04:29.125
This is not your fault!

1:04:30.041 --> 1:04:31.000
You are cursed!

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:31.958
Hello.

1:04:32.833 --> 1:04:34.750
[screaming]

1:04:34.833 --> 1:04:37.166
Mommy! No! Help me, Mommy!

1:04:37.250 --> 1:04:39.833
Help me! Help me!

1:04:39.916 --> 1:04:43.833
[sobbing, heaving]

1:04:43.916 --> 1:04:45.875
-[man] And stay out!
-[women laughing]

1:04:45.958 --> 1:04:49.291
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:04:49.375 --> 1:04:50.541
That was so terrifying!

1:04:50.625 --> 1:04:52.958
-That was even crazier than last year!
-Yes!

1:04:53.041 --> 1:04:55.500
-How much fun was that?
-That was so much fun. [laughing]

1:04:55.583 --> 1:04:58.291
It almost made me forget
that I buried my father today.

1:04:58.958 --> 1:05:00.083
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:05:00.166 --> 1:05:04.291
No, it's a good thing.
I mean, not for him so much,

1:05:04.375 --> 1:05:07.375
but it's given me
time to be introspective.

1:05:07.833 --> 1:05:09.291
-That's good.
-I'm Pete Landolfa.

1:05:09.375 --> 1:05:10.541
Oh, I'm Chantal.

1:05:10.625 --> 1:05:11.583
-Chantal?
-Yeah.

1:05:11.666 --> 1:05:14.250
[spooky theremin music playing]

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:18.833
Come to me.

1:05:22.208 --> 1:05:24.083
Walter. Come!

1:05:26.916 --> 1:05:27.750
Here, Walter.

1:05:27.833 --> 1:05:29.250
[patting leg]

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:34.458
I don't wanna do this.

1:05:34.958 --> 1:05:36.958
You've been a very good neighbor to me.

1:05:37.041 --> 1:05:39.041
But what has to be done, has to be done.

1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:42.541
Right between…

1:05:43.791 --> 1:05:44.708
the eyes!

1:05:46.833 --> 1:05:49.041
Oh, no.

1:05:49.125 --> 1:05:50.083
-[dog barks]
-No!

1:05:50.166 --> 1:05:51.958
Homeboy. Are you okay, man?

1:05:52.041 --> 1:05:55.000
[screaming hysterically]

1:05:55.083 --> 1:05:56.000
-Dude.
-No!

1:05:56.083 --> 1:05:58.625
This is not real. You get that, right?

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:01.083
We're just trying to
raise money for our school.

1:06:01.166 --> 1:06:02.916
[continues screaming]

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:03.958
Wait a second.

1:06:04.958 --> 1:06:06.500
-Are you hittin' on me?
-[laughing]

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:08.583
Because if so, that is incredibly sick.

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:10.125
We're having a conversation.

1:06:10.208 --> 1:06:12.916
Mm-mmm. 'Cause you're, like,
three times my age, okay?

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.750
Thrice. I was born around the same time
you had your first heart bypass.

1:06:16.833 --> 1:06:20.583
-[dog barks]
-Oh, Buster! Hey, my big boy.

1:06:20.666 --> 1:06:24.500
Are you here to protect me from this
weirdo man that's trying to hit on me?

1:06:24.583 --> 1:06:27.125
-[screaming hysterically]
-[growls]

1:06:28.875 --> 1:06:31.500
[screaming] My eyes are on fire!

1:06:31.583 --> 1:06:33.500
-Why would you mace me?
-Yo.

1:06:33.583 --> 1:06:35.125
I'm a dentist. I help people!

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:37.708
Liar! Lucifer!

1:06:37.791 --> 1:06:41.083
[laughing] That sounds like Hubie Dubois.

1:06:41.166 --> 1:06:44.833
And since I struck out with you,
I'm gonna take it out on him.

1:06:45.458 --> 1:06:46.708
Have fun with that.

1:06:47.375 --> 1:06:49.458
[man laughing maniacally]

1:06:51.041 --> 1:06:52.916
[panting]

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:56.000
[maniacal laughter continues]

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.666
[gasps] Oh! Oh!

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:02.000
You gotta be-- Whoa. [chuckles]

1:07:03.166 --> 1:07:06.583
There's this goof headed his way.
Hubie Dubois.

1:07:06.666 --> 1:07:09.541
When he gets here,
I'll handle the scaring.

1:07:09.625 --> 1:07:11.750
You just sit back and enjoy. [snickers]

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.458
[Hubie] Attention, haunted house patrons.

1:07:15.541 --> 1:07:18.666
This is a direct order from the AUU.

1:07:18.750 --> 1:07:21.583
Move quickly and quietly toward the exits.

1:07:21.666 --> 1:07:23.708
The man-wolf has eaten his kryptonite!

1:07:24.125 --> 1:07:25.125
Pubie!

1:07:25.208 --> 1:07:27.291
[screaming]

1:07:27.375 --> 1:07:28.291
[gasps] Huh?

1:07:29.375 --> 1:07:31.208
Oh, my God. This is a travesty.

1:07:31.291 --> 1:07:34.125
First, Mike Mundi. Now, Mr. Landolfa.

1:07:34.833 --> 1:07:36.916
And why would God
do this to such good people?

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:40.875
Good people?
All those two ever did was abuse you, man.

1:07:40.958 --> 1:07:44.458
You know who should feel bad right now?
Our wonderful mayor.

1:07:44.541 --> 1:07:45.791
I'm truly sorry.

1:07:45.875 --> 1:07:48.625
You knew that high school kid
from the corn maze was missing.

1:07:48.708 --> 1:07:51.291
-But you told nobody.
-Yeah. Bad for business, I guess.

1:07:51.375 --> 1:07:55.166
Oh, they just found Lester Hennessy's car
abandoned in the middle of Whipstick Road.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:58.125
-No sign of Lester or Mary.
-No!

1:07:58.625 --> 1:08:00.000
So, we are cancelin' the fireworks

1:08:00.083 --> 1:08:02.291
and all other related
Halloween activities.

1:08:02.375 --> 1:08:04.250
-Officer Steve.
-Not now, Hubie.

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:07.291
-I think I know who did it.
-Oh, so do I.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:08.458
His name…

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:11.375
is Walter Lambert.

1:08:11.958 --> 1:08:13.166
-Walter who?
-Lambert.

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.083
Scientists would call him a lyco-thorpe.

1:08:17.166 --> 1:08:18.750
I think he means a lycanthrope.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:20.583
-Is that what it is?
-It's a werewolf.

1:08:20.666 --> 1:08:22.375
-Okay.
-Hubie, I will lock you up.

1:08:22.458 --> 1:08:25.041
-I got four people missing here.
-Officer Steve, listen to me.

1:08:25.125 --> 1:08:28.375
I saw the man
destroy his home earlier today.

1:08:28.458 --> 1:08:30.291
Then I saw him in the pumpkin patch.

1:08:30.375 --> 1:08:33.791
His shirt was torn up.
He was barking at the moon.

1:08:33.875 --> 1:08:35.458
His arms were very, very hairy.

1:08:35.541 --> 1:08:40.583
Then I saw him at this haunted house,
his tail wagging in murderous glee.

1:08:41.083 --> 1:08:44.708
-Wait, you talking about my dog, Buster.
-That was Walter Lambert!

1:08:45.291 --> 1:08:46.291
Where does he live?

1:08:46.375 --> 1:08:48.333
Fifty-Nine Elm Street. Check on it.

1:08:48.416 --> 1:08:50.208
-There's your killer.
-[man on phone] Salem PD.

1:08:50.291 --> 1:08:52.208
Blake, I need you to go out to 59 Elm.

1:08:52.291 --> 1:08:55.083
There should be a guy there.
New in town. Possibly shirtless.

1:08:55.166 --> 1:08:58.333
Yeah. Middle-aged,
growls a lot, glue-on hairy hands?

1:08:58.416 --> 1:09:00.958
Yeah, I got him right here.
Him and your boy, Richie Hartman.

1:09:01.041 --> 1:09:04.000
They both came by and turned themselves
in, like, 45 minutes ago.

1:09:04.083 --> 1:09:05.083
Together?

1:09:05.166 --> 1:09:08.916
Yeah. Apparently, Lambert is
Hartman's roommate at the mental hospital.

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.250
Sorry. Werewolf Treatment Center.

1:09:12.333 --> 1:09:15.583
Lambert broke out about a month ago,
and then Hartman broke out yesterday

1:09:15.666 --> 1:09:17.916
to try to find him
and convince him to come back.

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.541
It's actually pretty sweet, isn't it?

1:09:19.625 --> 1:09:21.833
So, you've had eyes
on them for 45 minutes?

1:09:21.916 --> 1:09:23.375
[Blake] Almost, like, an hour now.

1:09:23.458 --> 1:09:26.916
And also, Lambert's real name is
Nick Hudson. Yeah. Walter Lambert

1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.625
is just some name that he got off
a tombstone on his way into town.

1:09:29.708 --> 1:09:31.791
All right, Blake. I got it. Thank you.

1:09:31.875 --> 1:09:35.541
I feel bad you got yourself
in even more trouble just to save me.

1:09:35.625 --> 1:09:38.291
No, it was good
to get out of that place for a while.

1:09:38.375 --> 1:09:41.416
-You did me a favor. Thank you.
-Did you do anything fun?

1:09:42.083 --> 1:09:45.000
I pissed on a tombstone,
pissed on the street.

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:47.458
Just some fun pissing stuff, you know.

1:09:47.541 --> 1:09:50.375
-Nobody pees more than you.
-I'm peein' now.

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:53.541
[both laughing]

1:09:56.958 --> 1:10:01.083
-That's a good roommate. Yes. [chuckles]
-[sniffing, panting]

1:10:01.166 --> 1:10:02.833
-Who's a good roommate? Yes. Yes.
-[barking]

1:10:02.916 --> 1:10:04.291
[Hartman chuckling] Yes, you are.

1:10:06.083 --> 1:10:10.375
Lambert and Hartman have been in custody
during the whole Landolfa disappearance.

1:10:10.458 --> 1:10:11.916
So, it couldn't have been them.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.083
-[dog whimpers]
-Buster, my baby!

1:10:15.166 --> 1:10:18.333
Oh, by the way, he ate a silver bullet
if you wanna check his feces tomorrow.

1:10:18.416 --> 1:10:19.666
I ain't doin' that.

1:10:20.458 --> 1:10:22.916
Then who? Are there any clues?

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.708
Landolfa did go back
into the haunted house to look for Hubie.

1:10:26.791 --> 1:10:31.375
Yeah. Hubie seems to be around
a lot of people before they go missing.

1:10:32.791 --> 1:10:35.833
-People who have messed with him.
-Did the Hennesseys mess with Hubie, too?

1:10:36.416 --> 1:10:37.541
Oh, they live for it.

1:10:37.625 --> 1:10:41.208
So, it was payback time. Wasn't it, Hubie?

1:10:41.291 --> 1:10:44.291
No, I would never hurt anybody. I--

1:10:44.375 --> 1:10:45.666
You got the wrong guy.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.166
-Father Dave.
-Have you been planning this all along?

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:52.250
-[snarling]
-You sick man.

1:10:52.333 --> 1:10:53.958
-Have you?
-I--

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:55.750
Have you?

1:10:56.916 --> 1:10:57.750
Frankenstein!

1:10:58.291 --> 1:10:59.500
[dog grunts]

1:11:00.125 --> 1:11:01.041
[woman groans]

1:11:01.125 --> 1:11:04.250
Did we just fall
for  the old Frankenstein trick?

1:11:05.541 --> 1:11:08.208
[whimpering]

1:11:08.958 --> 1:11:10.375
[screams, thuds]

1:11:11.250 --> 1:11:12.791
[crying, whimpering]

1:11:12.875 --> 1:11:14.083
[screams] Oh-ho!

1:11:14.166 --> 1:11:15.041
[yells] Ya!

1:11:17.166 --> 1:11:18.083
[shrieks]

1:11:19.875 --> 1:11:22.666
[whimpering, screaming]

1:11:24.791 --> 1:11:26.083
[hooting]

1:11:26.166 --> 1:11:27.708
[grunting]

1:11:28.708 --> 1:11:30.208
-[Aurora] Bad news, gang.
-[thunderclap]

1:11:30.291 --> 1:11:31.958
WTCH has just learned

1:11:32.041 --> 1:11:34.625
that Salem's Halloween
is getting shut down.

1:11:34.708 --> 1:11:37.500
-[growling]
-[Hubie screaming]

1:11:37.583 --> 1:11:41.458
[Aurora] The police department is advising
everyone to stay home and lock doors.

1:11:42.750 --> 1:11:45.666
But, my little Halloweenies,
we can all still celebrate

1:11:45.750 --> 1:11:48.583
with nature's fireworks
lighting up the night sky.

1:11:48.666 --> 1:11:50.875
[thunderclap]

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:53.458
Not sure what's happening
in this creepy town,

1:11:53.541 --> 1:11:56.708
but sounds like a good idea
to cuddle up with someone special

1:11:56.791 --> 1:12:00.541
and enjoy the last half hour
of Halloween under the covers.

1:12:00.625 --> 1:12:03.916
And just hope that whoever
you cuddling isn't a madman.

1:12:04.625 --> 1:12:11.583
[Aurora laughing maniacally]

1:12:20.416 --> 1:12:21.625
[mouthing]

1:12:22.666 --> 1:12:24.500
[thunder rumbling]

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:30.583
Well, looks like I have company.

1:12:31.125 --> 1:12:33.833
So, we're going to take
a word from our scary sponsors.

1:12:34.458 --> 1:12:36.833
-[whistles like theremin]
-[man] W… T… C… H.

1:12:36.916 --> 1:12:38.958
-Aurora?
-[gasps]

1:12:39.625 --> 1:12:41.500
-[deep voice] Hubie Dubois.
-Yes.

1:12:41.583 --> 1:12:45.125
I'd recognize that voice anywhere.
You look exactly how I pictured you.

1:12:45.208 --> 1:12:50.083
To be honest with you, you don't look like
the way I was picturing you.

1:12:50.666 --> 1:12:53.541
[high-pitched voice] I guess my
radio voice throws people off sometimes.

1:12:53.625 --> 1:12:55.166
Yeah, that-- I think that's it.

1:12:55.250 --> 1:12:56.875
[giggling in high-pitched voice]

1:12:56.958 --> 1:12:58.125
[deep voice] Have a seat, man.

1:12:59.458 --> 1:13:01.083
["Werewolves of London" playing]

1:13:01.166 --> 1:13:02.958
What brings you
all the way here this evenin'?

1:13:03.041 --> 1:13:06.916
As you know, I'm a longtime listener,
and I always respect the advice you give

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:08.083
to so many callers.

1:13:08.166 --> 1:13:12.541
Right now, I'm in dire need
of the most perspicacious advice

1:13:12.625 --> 1:13:14.750
-you have ever given to any other human--
-[knocking]

1:13:15.375 --> 1:13:19.291
[Aurora gasps] Oh, my God. Isn't that
so sweet? My wife brought snacks.

1:13:19.375 --> 1:13:22.625
[deep voice] Ooh!
Hey, baby. How you doin'?

1:13:22.708 --> 1:13:25.041
Oh, and who is this?

1:13:25.125 --> 1:13:26.708
Baby, this is Hubie Dubois.

1:13:26.791 --> 1:13:28.833
Whoa! For real?

1:13:28.916 --> 1:13:30.875
Yes. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:33.375
I'm looking forward
to hearing your real voice.

1:13:34.125 --> 1:13:35.708
This is my real voice.

1:13:36.625 --> 1:13:39.250
Right. I know it is.
I was just saying, you know…

1:13:39.958 --> 1:13:42.291
So, I am a big fan
of your husband, Aurora.

1:13:42.375 --> 1:13:43.500
Oh, yeah.

1:13:43.583 --> 1:13:47.458
I feel like you're the second
most frequent caller we get.

1:13:47.541 --> 1:13:50.416
-Besides that one lady.
-Someone calls more than I do?

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:54.083
[laughs] Actually, I think she might have
a little something for you, Hubie.

1:13:54.166 --> 1:13:57.625
She always dedicates
a song to a special someone.

1:13:57.708 --> 1:13:58.750
Ooh!

1:13:58.833 --> 1:14:01.541
And we all need that special someone.

1:14:01.625 --> 1:14:03.291
-Right, baby?
-Yes, we do. Oh!

1:14:03.375 --> 1:14:04.208
Dig in.

1:14:04.291 --> 1:14:10.958
[both moaning]

1:14:11.833 --> 1:14:13.708
-A couple days back…
-Oh, man.

1:14:13.791 --> 1:14:17.166
…she had a couple glasses of Chardonnay.
Her guard was down,

1:14:17.750 --> 1:14:20.666
and she asked
to dedicate a special song to Hubie.

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:23.750
-Chardonnay, eh?
-You know what they say about Chardonnay?

1:14:24.583 --> 1:14:29.583
Truth serum. She said she's gonna show you
how much she loves you on Halloween.

1:14:30.333 --> 1:14:34.125
-Do you think we could trace the number?
-I don't need to. Caller ID.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:38.166
617-555-0968.

1:14:38.250 --> 1:14:39.125
Sound familiar?

1:14:39.208 --> 1:14:42.791
No. But there is a number
that needs to be dialed immediately.

1:14:43.458 --> 1:14:44.291
911!

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:47.750
[hooting]

1:14:51.875 --> 1:14:52.958
[computer beeping]

1:14:53.666 --> 1:14:54.541
Oh.

1:14:54.625 --> 1:14:56.250
It's a prepaid phone.

1:14:56.333 --> 1:14:58.750
-[high-pitched voice] Bitch used a burner.
-Mm-hmm.

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:00.916
[moaning softly]

1:15:01.916 --> 1:15:05.083
Any idea of someone
who might have a thing for you, or…

1:15:05.166 --> 1:15:07.458
How would somebody
detect such a situation?

1:15:07.541 --> 1:15:11.958
Anyone in town who seems like
they might actually enjoy talking to you.

1:15:12.041 --> 1:15:15.000
There's one woman, but she's
the nicest lady I ever met my life.

1:15:15.083 --> 1:15:17.166
Well, they all seem nice
till they kill you.

1:15:17.250 --> 1:15:18.958
What's the desperate sicko's name?

1:15:20.833 --> 1:15:21.750
Um…

1:15:23.750 --> 1:15:25.958
[whispers] The high school hat trick,
Violet Valentine.

1:15:26.041 --> 1:15:28.166
[laughing]

1:15:29.375 --> 1:15:31.333
Her? And you?

1:15:31.416 --> 1:15:32.333
I mean…

1:15:33.958 --> 1:15:36.375
All right. Let's go see
if we can get ourselves a confession.

1:15:36.458 --> 1:15:40.583
Ooh! This is some Dateline NBC shit.

1:15:46.250 --> 1:15:49.208
[Hubie]
Stormhawk in position and petrified. Over.

1:15:49.291 --> 1:15:51.583
All right. First of all,
we're not gonna use code names.

1:15:51.666 --> 1:15:52.666
-Okay?
-[Hubie] Copy.

1:15:52.750 --> 1:15:56.333
Did you send backup to my residence
to have eyes on my mother? Over.

1:15:56.416 --> 1:15:58.125
I'm a little short-handed tonight,

1:15:58.208 --> 1:15:59.916
so I asked Father Dave
to keep an eye on her.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.083
Negative! Request armed units
to that vicinity. Over.

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:05.333
Sorry. I can't spare the manpower tonight.

1:16:05.416 --> 1:16:06.250
Here she comes.

1:16:06.708 --> 1:16:10.708
Okay, Hubie. It's showtime.
Remember, we're lookin' for a confession.

1:16:10.791 --> 1:16:12.500
But what if I can't get her to confess?
Over.

1:16:12.583 --> 1:16:15.625
If you feel like you've done all you can,
or you feel like you're in danger,

1:16:15.708 --> 1:16:18.875
say the code word. At that point,
we'll call the burner phone.

1:16:18.958 --> 1:16:20.750
If she picks up,
we can implicate her that way.

1:16:20.833 --> 1:16:22.416
And what's the code word again? Over.

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:25.125
-You don't have to say over.
-[Hubie] Okay.

1:16:25.208 --> 1:16:26.500
Code word is pumpkin.

1:16:27.083 --> 1:16:29.083
Roger that. Bogey on my twelve.

1:16:29.166 --> 1:16:31.333
Three on a match.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

1:16:31.416 --> 1:16:33.791
"Smoke 'em if you got--"
What the hell is he talking about?

1:16:33.875 --> 1:16:35.083
I don't know.

1:16:41.666 --> 1:16:43.666
What'd you ask me out here for, Hubie?

1:16:43.750 --> 1:16:44.583
What's up?

1:16:46.791 --> 1:16:47.625
Pumpkin.

1:16:47.708 --> 1:16:48.583
[groans]

1:16:48.666 --> 1:16:50.125
-Straight to pumpkin?
-Yeah.

1:16:50.208 --> 1:16:52.166
Pumpkin what?

1:16:52.250 --> 1:16:53.083
Just pumpkin.

1:16:53.833 --> 1:16:54.666
Don't kill me.

1:16:54.750 --> 1:16:56.583
-You gotta be kiddin' me.
-Dialing.

1:16:57.250 --> 1:16:58.208
Hubie.

1:16:59.166 --> 1:17:00.916
I would never hurt you.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:02.541
Thank you. Pumpkin.

1:17:03.416 --> 1:17:04.541
Now! Pumpkin.

1:17:04.625 --> 1:17:05.458
[call ringing]

1:17:05.541 --> 1:17:06.916
-It's ringing.
-Is this a prank?

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000
Is there somebody watching us right now?

1:17:09.083 --> 1:17:12.250
-No one can see us or hear us.
-She must not have the phone on her.

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:15.333
[heavy breathing]

1:17:15.416 --> 1:17:16.250
Hello?

1:17:17.666 --> 1:17:22.083
I just wanted to tell you that I have been
in love with you since second grade.

1:17:22.708 --> 1:17:24.166
-What?
-Hello?

1:17:24.250 --> 1:17:25.833
[whispers] Can you trace it now?

1:17:25.916 --> 1:17:27.666
[heavy breathing continues]

1:17:27.750 --> 1:17:32.291
Hubie, I've been in love
with you since the first grade.

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:35.750
What took you so long?

1:17:36.875 --> 1:17:38.541
I was in love with our teacher.

1:17:39.166 --> 1:17:40.000
Miss Glennon?

1:17:41.083 --> 1:17:44.541
-Wasn't she, like, 70?
-I liked the way she smelled.

1:17:46.458 --> 1:17:47.541
I can't believe this.

1:17:48.083 --> 1:17:53.375
I can't believe that I spent three years
with a self-confident-for-no-reason,

1:17:53.458 --> 1:17:56.958
bearded, human-ogre
when I could have been with you.

1:17:57.041 --> 1:17:58.791
Ouch. That even hurt me.

1:18:00.791 --> 1:18:03.625
I'm getting a location.
Steve, look at this.

1:18:04.583 --> 1:18:07.125
-[Steve] Stormhawk, abort!
-I thought you were out of my league.

1:18:07.208 --> 1:18:08.833
-Why?
-Stormhawk, repeat, abort!

1:18:08.916 --> 1:18:10.583
It's the best news
I ever heard in my life.

1:18:10.666 --> 1:18:13.291
Abort.
The killer's cell phone is in your house!

1:18:13.375 --> 1:18:14.958
Mama!

1:18:15.041 --> 1:18:17.583
No! No way!

1:18:17.666 --> 1:18:20.708
Lock your doors!
Make sure you don't open them!

1:18:20.791 --> 1:18:23.541
Take care of your children!
I'm gonna steal a boat!

1:18:23.625 --> 1:18:25.458
Mama!

1:18:27.541 --> 1:18:28.458
I love you!

1:18:35.708 --> 1:18:38.333
[clock chiming]

1:18:42.333 --> 1:18:44.875
Oh, no. They got Father Dave.

1:18:48.250 --> 1:18:49.208
Oh, my God.

1:18:49.291 --> 1:18:50.916
-Boo!
-[screaming]

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.500
[laughing]

1:18:54.083 --> 1:18:55.791
Why aren't you watching my mother?

1:18:55.875 --> 1:18:59.041
The killer's in the house!
The killer's in the house!

1:18:59.125 --> 1:19:00.958
There's no one in the house but her.

1:19:02.208 --> 1:19:03.041
Hubie?

1:19:03.875 --> 1:19:04.958
Can you help me down?

1:19:06.458 --> 1:19:07.666
Ma! Ma!

1:19:11.083 --> 1:19:12.041
You're okay.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:16.166
Why, yes, Hubie. Why wouldn't I be?

1:19:16.916 --> 1:19:17.791
Mmm.

1:19:25.500 --> 1:19:26.333
Oh, no.

1:19:33.791 --> 1:19:35.000
So, um…

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:39.458
Am I your special someone, Mom?

1:19:40.333 --> 1:19:41.458
Always, Hubie.

1:19:42.041 --> 1:19:42.916
Mm-hmm.

1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:46.000
And… today, did you--

1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:50.041
did you try to show me
just how much you love me?

1:19:51.208 --> 1:19:54.500
Why, yes, I did, Hubie. I truly did.

1:20:13.125 --> 1:20:14.541
-[man 1] Hubie!
-[woman 1] Hubie!

1:20:14.625 --> 1:20:16.416
[man 1] Get us out of here! Help!

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:18.833
[Landolfa]
Hubie, please, get us out of here!

1:20:18.916 --> 1:20:20.791
[all shouting hysterically]

1:20:20.875 --> 1:20:22.625
Hubie, there's something
wrong with your mom!

1:20:22.708 --> 1:20:24.833
Come on over here
and let me punch your mom in the face!

1:20:24.916 --> 1:20:27.458
I mean, the good news is
you're still alive. I was--

1:20:27.541 --> 1:20:29.833
Nice observation, toolbox!
Now get us out of this!

1:20:29.916 --> 1:20:34.375
-I'm so sorry.
-I tried to explain to you already, Hubie.

1:20:34.458 --> 1:20:37.958
If you don't fight back,
the bullies never stop.

1:20:38.041 --> 1:20:40.500
So, I had to fight back for you.

1:20:40.583 --> 1:20:42.083
[Mike] Please, Hubie!
Oh, my God!

1:20:42.166 --> 1:20:43.250
Hubie, that's gas!

1:20:43.333 --> 1:20:46.708
Mommy, I would've been satisfied if you
put itching powder in their sleeping bag.

1:20:46.791 --> 1:20:48.000
This is extreme.

1:20:48.791 --> 1:20:51.500
Don't do this to me.
Hubie, I'll be your friend forever!

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:53.041
[tires screech]

1:20:53.125 --> 1:20:54.333
[all chattering, shouting]

1:20:54.416 --> 1:20:56.333
[man] The old lady said
they'd be in the backyard.

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.500
[Tracy] Roll it! Roll it!

1:20:57.583 --> 1:20:59.333
You don't have to do this.
This is too much.

1:20:59.416 --> 1:21:04.083
We are here and we are live at
an unfolding scene of Halloween horror.

1:21:04.166 --> 1:21:06.750
-[victims shouting, chattering]
-[Hubie] Ma. Ma.

1:21:06.833 --> 1:21:09.958
-Mom, I really don't want you to do this.
-I know, Hubie.

1:21:10.041 --> 1:21:13.708
That's what makes you so wonderful.
And that's why I have to do it.

1:21:13.791 --> 1:21:16.250
I have to make it
good for you before I go.

1:21:16.333 --> 1:21:17.166
Before you go?

1:21:18.291 --> 1:21:21.166
-To Heaven?
-No. Probably going to Hell, Hubie.

1:21:21.250 --> 1:21:22.541
[sirens wailing]

1:21:22.625 --> 1:21:25.750
The cops are here!
You're goin' to jail, you crazy old bat!

1:21:25.833 --> 1:21:29.666
-Well, then I better do this now.
-[Mr. Hennessy] My God. No, lady. Wait.

1:21:29.750 --> 1:21:32.083
-[all screaming, shouting]
-No! No, no, no, no!

1:21:32.166 --> 1:21:33.958
-Please don't.
-[Landolfa] Hubie, stop her.

1:21:34.041 --> 1:21:37.625
[voices muted]

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:40.750
[distorted, echoing] Help me!

1:21:44.125 --> 1:21:46.000
-Hubie!
-[Hubie screams]

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:48.000
[Landolfa laughing]

1:21:49.833 --> 1:21:50.666
No!

1:21:51.541 --> 1:21:53.916
[screaming]

1:21:54.666 --> 1:21:55.708
[echoing] No.

1:21:57.166 --> 1:21:59.583
[screaming] No!

1:22:00.625 --> 1:22:07.500
[all laughing maniacally]

1:22:12.166 --> 1:22:16.250
Always thinking of everyone else,
never thinking of yourself.

1:22:16.333 --> 1:22:18.541
But I guess that's why you're a hero.

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:21.875
[Landolfa] Hubie!

1:22:22.458 --> 1:22:25.041
No!

1:22:44.041 --> 1:22:44.875
[squeals]

1:22:44.958 --> 1:22:46.458
-Man.
-Freeze, Mrs. Dubois!

1:22:48.208 --> 1:22:49.833
Hold your fire until my command.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:51.500
Why did we bring them again?

1:22:51.583 --> 1:22:53.958
There was nobody left at the station.
We had to.

1:22:54.041 --> 1:22:56.625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy.
This is my fault.

1:22:56.708 --> 1:22:58.416
-[Mom] That's okay, Hubie.
-[Landolfa] Hubie!

1:22:58.500 --> 1:23:00.541
-Untie us, dummy!
-Come on, you stupid dummy!

1:23:00.625 --> 1:23:02.833
-Untie us, now!
-[Mike] Are you paying attention?

1:23:02.916 --> 1:23:04.625
[Mom] Okay. Wow.

1:23:05.250 --> 1:23:06.750
Shame on you.

1:23:06.833 --> 1:23:10.125
Hubie just saved your lives,
and you treat him like this.

1:23:10.916 --> 1:23:12.958
Can one of you tell me why?

1:23:13.041 --> 1:23:14.708
[Landolfa] Just look at him!

1:23:14.791 --> 1:23:16.625
He's so… Hubie!

1:23:16.708 --> 1:23:18.500
[all snickering]

1:23:18.583 --> 1:23:20.041
Yes, he's Hubie.

1:23:20.125 --> 1:23:21.666
He's helpful.

1:23:22.375 --> 1:23:25.875
He's courteous,
he's cheerful, he's considerate.

1:23:25.958 --> 1:23:27.833
What a bad, bad man.

1:23:27.916 --> 1:23:31.958
My great-great-great-great-great-
grandmother laid down her life,

1:23:32.041 --> 1:23:34.125
trying to save innocent people.

1:23:34.208 --> 1:23:35.416
I was there.

1:23:35.500 --> 1:23:41.000
And my son did her one better.
He just saved four ungrateful jackasses.

1:23:41.750 --> 1:23:42.583
Thanks, Pubie.

1:23:42.666 --> 1:23:45.541
Well, you can't even
thank him without insulting him.

1:23:45.625 --> 1:23:48.583
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said Pubie.
It just came out.

1:23:48.666 --> 1:23:51.375
Could it be because you feel threatened?

1:23:52.583 --> 1:23:53.833
[stammers]

1:23:54.541 --> 1:23:56.958
I feel a lot of pressure
to be cool all the time.

1:23:57.916 --> 1:24:00.166
I'm jealous of Hubie
being able to be himself.

1:24:00.708 --> 1:24:03.250
I lost my hair 20 years ago,

1:24:03.333 --> 1:24:05.750
and every time I walk into a room,
I feel silly.

1:24:06.333 --> 1:24:11.083
Why should someone like Hubie
have such a thick, luxuriant head of hair,

1:24:11.166 --> 1:24:13.875
and I look like a California raisin?

1:24:15.166 --> 1:24:17.208
I have never felt sexually fulfilled.

1:24:17.291 --> 1:24:18.666
-But--
-Oh, shut up, Lester.

1:24:18.750 --> 1:24:21.083
You're usually there. You know it's true.

1:24:21.166 --> 1:24:22.791
I'm guessing…

1:24:22.875 --> 1:24:25.250
Hubie hasn't had a lot of sex.

1:24:25.916 --> 1:24:26.750
No, ma'am.

1:24:27.666 --> 1:24:28.916
Hasn't had any sex.

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:29.833
Mmm.

1:24:30.916 --> 1:24:32.625
But what he does have is hope.

1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:36.666
Damn him and his hope!

1:24:39.583 --> 1:24:42.708
I was diagnosed
with dyslexia in the eighth grade.

1:24:43.458 --> 1:24:47.875
I faked it for the doctors,
but I'm really just dumb.

1:24:48.583 --> 1:24:50.708
I never really told anybody.

1:24:51.708 --> 1:24:53.916
You're probably all surprised.

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:55.666
-No, I'm not surprised.
-Nope.

1:24:55.750 --> 1:24:56.833
-You surprised?
-[laughs] No.

1:24:57.583 --> 1:25:02.291
But Hubie uses big words,
and they come out so natural for him.

1:25:02.375 --> 1:25:03.750
It pisses me off.

1:25:04.250 --> 1:25:05.708
Oh, 'cause of the dumb thing.

1:25:06.583 --> 1:25:09.083
My brother-in-law
once said that I had no ambition.

1:25:10.416 --> 1:25:12.583
And then he bit me,
and I became a werewolf.

1:25:13.750 --> 1:25:14.666
[howls softly]

1:25:16.083 --> 1:25:16.916
You see?

1:25:17.708 --> 1:25:21.500
Hubie's smart,
has nice hair, and sex hope.

1:25:22.166 --> 1:25:23.000
But to me,

1:25:23.666 --> 1:25:25.708
his best quality is this.

1:25:25.791 --> 1:25:30.333
He can weather all of your insults
and your thrown objects,

1:25:30.416 --> 1:25:34.333
and he responds with humor
and-- and kindness.

1:25:34.958 --> 1:25:36.291
Could you say the same?

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:40.875
Could any of you take
the abuse you dish out to my Hubie?

1:25:42.791 --> 1:25:46.166
I busted a guy for DWI last week, and, uh…

1:25:46.958 --> 1:25:50.458
he said it was an honor
to be arrested by a Muppet.

1:25:51.916 --> 1:25:53.500
I acted like I didn't hear him.

1:25:54.416 --> 1:25:57.000
But then I cried in my squad car
for about half an hour.

1:25:57.375 --> 1:26:01.375
You see, Hubie. True bravery's being kind.

1:26:01.833 --> 1:26:04.458
Even to those who are being cruel to you.

1:26:05.166 --> 1:26:07.250
I just always wanted
to be as nice as you, Mom.
