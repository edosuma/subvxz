NOW TO QUIETLY LOOK
FOR SIGNS OF EVIL.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.814
[dog yelps]

18:01.880 --> 18:04.149
[clattering and shouting]

18:04.216 --> 18:06.118
[loud rock music]

18:06.185 --> 18:07.553
[jazz music]

18:07.619 --> 18:09.955
[music powers down]

18:10.022 --> 18:11.223
- [snoring]

18:11.290 --> 18:14.860
- MMM, LEMON CREAMIES.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.895
[gagging and coughing]

18:16.962 --> 18:18.130
COOKIE CAM!

18:18.197 --> 18:19.965
- UGH.
TURNER!

18:20.032 --> 18:21.533
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.970
AND MAY I SAY, THAT'S A LOVELY
FLORAL ENSEMBLE YOU'RE WEARING.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.071
- EH-EH-EH-EH!

18:26.138 --> 18:27.973
PLEASE DON'T DO EVIL THINGS
TO ME.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.275
I'LL GIVE YOU BACK
YOUR KIDNEY.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.310
- DON'T BE SILLY, TURNER.

18:31.376 --> 18:32.478
THAT'S YOURS TO KEEP.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.346
HOW ABOUT A SOOTHING CUP
OF COCOA?

18:34.413 --> 18:35.814
- WELL, I DO NEED SOMETHING

18:35.881 --> 18:38.350
TO WASH DOWN THE TINY CAMERA
THAT'S LODGED IN MY THROAT.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.551
- RELAX, TURNER.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.087
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE...

18:42.154 --> 18:45.724
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING HOME.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.932
YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME
ALL ALONG, TURNER.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.469
THE TRUTH IS, I AM EVIL.

18:57.536 --> 18:58.770
- YOU MEAN I WAS RIGHT?

18:58.837 --> 18:59.771
YAY!

18:59.838 --> 19:00.772
NO, WAIT.
THAT'S BAD.

19:00.839 --> 19:01.773
BOO!

19:01.840 --> 19:02.841
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE ME

19:02.908 --> 19:04.710
TO YOUR SMALL-INTESTINE-SHAPED
LAIR?

19:04.776 --> 19:07.446
- YOU'RE ALREADY IN IT.

19:07.513 --> 19:10.449
[laughs evilly]

19:14.319 --> 19:17.789
YOU SEE, TURNER, I'M THE LEADER
OF A SECRET ORGANIZATION

19:17.856 --> 19:19.458
KNOWN AS M.E.A.N.:

19:19.525 --> 19:22.494
THE MINISTRY OF EVIL
AND ABUSIVE NEIGHBORS.

19:22.561 --> 19:23.829
- SO ALL THESE YEARS,

19:23.896 --> 19:26.164
YOU REALLY HAVE BEEN DOING
EVIL THINGS TO ME?

19:26.231 --> 19:27.633
- THAT'S RIGHT!

19:27.699 --> 19:29.968
WHY, JUST TODAY,
I FOOLED YOU INTO THINKING

19:30.035 --> 19:32.838
IT WOULD BE CLOUDY
WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.606
[swirling chimes]

19:34.673 --> 19:37.376
[ominous music]

19:39.211 --> 19:41.947
- DINKLEBERG...

19:42.014 --> 19:47.553
- THEN, I SNUCK INTO YOUR CLOSET
AND MADE ALL YOUR TIES CLASH.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.724
[booming blast]

19:52.791 --> 19:56.161
- [whistling]

19:56.228 --> 19:58.230
DEH!
DINKLEBERG....

19:58.297 --> 20:00.132
- [cackles]

20:00.198 --> 20:03.068
THEN, IN AN ACT OF EVIL
I'M ESPECIALLY PROUD OF,

20:03.135 --> 20:04.269
I CREPT INTO YOUR KITCHEN

20:04.336 --> 20:06.271
AND MADE SURE THERE WAS
NO MILK FOR YOUR CEREAL.

20:06.338 --> 20:07.272
[laughs]

20:07.339 --> 20:08.774
I MEAN--
[laughs evilly]

20:08.840 --> 20:10.275
[laughs evilly]

20:10.342 --> 20:12.911
- DEEEHH!

20:12.978 --> 20:14.813
YOU MONSTER!

20:14.880 --> 20:16.748
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT'S LIKE

20:16.815 --> 20:19.084
TO EAT DRY CEREAL
ON A CLOUDY DAY

20:19.151 --> 20:21.520
IN A CLASHING TIE?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.093
- POOF-POOF!

20:28.160 --> 20:29.094
- OH, NO!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.196
TIMMY, YOUR DAD'S IN TROUBLE!

20:31.263 --> 20:32.464
- WHOA, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

20:32.531 --> 20:34.566
HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT DINKLEBERG
ALL ALONG.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.902
NOW I'VE GOT TO RISK EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING OUR LIVES,

20:36.969 --> 20:38.003
TO SAVE HIM.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.405
[drill buzzing]

20:40.472 --> 20:42.808
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
TURNER?

20:42.874 --> 20:44.176
- OOH!

20:44.242 --> 20:46.178
THAT'S THE LIGHTWEIGHT
CORDLESS DRILL GENIE XK-7

20:46.244 --> 20:48.347
WITH THE PATENTED
COMFY-GRIP HANDLE.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.448
- THAT'S RIGHT!

20:49.514 --> 20:50.849
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

20:50.916 --> 20:52.351
WITH THIS DRILL?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.786
NEVER LET YOU BORROW IT!

20:54.853 --> 20:56.054
- NOOO!

20:56.121 --> 20:58.056
I LOVE THAT DRILL!

20:58.123 --> 21:02.027
OH, YOU'RE THE MOST EVIL
NEIGHBOR EVER!

21:02.094 --> 21:04.296
GOLDILOCKS!
SAVE ME!

21:04.363 --> 21:05.897
- YOU GOT IT, PAPA BEAR.

21:05.964 --> 21:06.898
- GIRL VOICE!

21:06.965 --> 21:08.100
- [high-pitched]
GUYS!

21:08.166 --> 21:10.535
[clears throat]
GUYS, I WISH MY DAD WAS FREE.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.274
- TIMMY, STOP TALKING
TO DINKLEBERG'S PIRANHAS

21:16.341 --> 21:17.476
AND HIT THAT BUTTON.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.623
[explosion]

21:36.995 --> 21:38.130
[explosion]

21:39.464 --> 21:41.333
YOU DID IT, SON!

21:41.400 --> 21:45.037
NOW WE CAN DEFEAT DINKLEBERG
TOGETHER.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.073
EEH...
TO THE ESCAPE CHUTE!

21:48.140 --> 21:49.508
I'LL CUSHION YOUR FALL.

21:49.574 --> 21:50.776
I'VE GOT YOU.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.547
- WHOA, MR. DINKLEBERG,

21:55.614 --> 21:57.849
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU REALLY ARE EVIL.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.751
- OH, I'M NOT REALLY EVIL,
TIMMY.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.920
I JUST KNEW HOW MUCH IT MEANT
TO YOUR FATHER

22:01.987 --> 22:03.422
TO THINK I WAS EVIL.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.625
- SO YOU DID ALL THIS
JUST TO MAKE MY DAD HAPPY?

22:06.692 --> 22:09.027
- THAT'S RIGHT;
I EVEN SHELLED OUT 30 GRAND

22:09.094 --> 22:11.430
FOR THIS SMALL-INTESTINE-SHAPED
LAIR.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.072
- WOW, YOU REALLY ARE
THE BEST NEIGHBOR EVER.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.140
- THAT'S WHY SANTA VISITS ME
IN SEPTEMBER.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.142
JUST DON'T TELL YOUR DAD
I'M NOT EVIL.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.777
IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.780
NOW, HERE, TAKE THIS NEW BIKE
AND A SACK OF CASH,

22:28.847 --> 22:31.483
AND BUY YOUR DAD
SOME SUSPENDERS.

22:31.550 --> 22:32.617
- GOLDILOCKS!

22:32.684 --> 22:34.519
I'M SO HAPPY!

22:34.586 --> 22:35.921
- 'CAUSE I'M SAFE AT HOME?

22:35.987 --> 22:37.689
- YES, YES, DUH.

22:37.756 --> 22:40.826
BUT ALSO BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT DINKLEBERG BEING EVIL.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.628
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S WORKING ALONE.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.831
THE REAL MASTERMIND
IS OUR OTHER NEIGHBOR,

22:45.897 --> 22:47.065
OLD LADY MARINELLI,

22:47.132 --> 22:49.101
AND WE'RE GOING TO PROVE IT.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.036
- COME ON, DAD.
MRS. MARINELLI?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.671
SHE WORKS WITH ORPHANS.

22:52.738 --> 22:53.672
- GIRL VOICE!

22:53.739 --> 22:55.107
- [sighs]

22:55.173 --> 22:56.308
- DINKLEBERG!
