00:51.519 --> 00:53.955
I think women
can do anything.

00:54.087 --> 00:56.591
Well, I mean,
just because they can,

00:56.724 --> 00:58.392
doesn't mean they should,
right?

01:00.193 --> 01:03.397
Think about women
fixing cars,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.399
driving a taxi,

01:05.533 --> 01:07.602
installing
some drywall.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.737
- Why not?
- No.

01:09.871 --> 01:11.171
Look, trust me.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.908
A girl like you,
you don't really want this.

01:14.042 --> 01:16.978
- A girl like me?
- Mm-hm.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.112
I mean, I want
all my options available

01:19.246 --> 01:20.582
so I can decide
for myself.

01:20.715 --> 01:23.383
Ah, Miss Independent.

01:23.518 --> 01:26.253
That's right.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.656
- That's me.
- I love it.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.224
Mm...

01:31.358 --> 01:33.460
- Come here.
- Hm...

01:37.832 --> 01:40.367
Oh, mm...

01:40.501 --> 01:42.704
Except
you're sitting here,

01:42.837 --> 01:46.340
eating my food,
enjoying my view.

01:46.473 --> 01:47.842
By choice.

01:47.976 --> 01:49.911
Mm, I chose you
to join me.

01:51.646 --> 01:54.649
- I chose to make you notice me.
- Ah, mm-mm.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.018
- That is not your choice, Sabina.
- Mm.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.653
That is God's gift to you.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.490
Gosh...

02:03.625 --> 02:05.125
But don't you think
it's sort of

02:05.258 --> 02:08.895
what you do with those gifts
that really matters?

02:09.030 --> 02:10.263
Mmm.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.465
- Every one of us.
- Mm?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.901
Men, women.

02:14.035 --> 02:16.004
We all just wanna
fulfill our potential,

02:16.136 --> 02:17.872
live our heart's desires.

02:18.006 --> 02:20.173
That's the kind of world
I wanna live in.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.175
Ah.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.780
Well, my world
is me making millions

02:25.913 --> 02:27.849
with you by my side.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.785
Hm?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.520
It's just that I'm so good

02:32.654 --> 02:34.656
at so many things.

02:34.789 --> 02:36.490
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.291
Like what?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.961
- Well...
- Hm?

02:40.094 --> 02:42.030
At my job,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.832
it's actually considered
a huge advantage to be a woman.

02:44.966 --> 02:47.135
Hm.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.736
Yeah,
if you're beautiful,

02:48.870 --> 02:51.139
nothing else
is really expected of you.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.540
And if you're not,

02:52.674 --> 02:54.876
you're pretty much
rendered invisible.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.846
- And in my line of work,
- Mm...

02:58.980 --> 03:03.183
invisibility,
low expectations...

03:03.316 --> 03:05.520
they come in very handy.

03:06.521 --> 03:08.221
Housewife, sounds like.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.391
Nothing wrong with being a housewife.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.055
Just not my choice.

03:15.163 --> 03:18.166
- I don't speak Portuguese.
- I know.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.606
Yeah, that's it.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.661
- Did you know...
- What?

03:46.794 --> 03:48.896
That it takes men
an additional seven seconds

03:49.030 --> 03:51.599
to perceive a woman
as a threat compared to a man.

03:53.201 --> 03:54.569
Isn't that wild?

03:58.773 --> 04:00.208
- Who are you?
- Who, me?

04:03.376 --> 04:04.912
I'm just the decoy, stud.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.189
- How many?
- Nine!

04:15.322 --> 04:16.524
Send the lot.

04:23.865 --> 04:27.568
You stole aid money from women
and children and refugees!

04:27.702 --> 04:28.903
It's called embezzlement!

04:30.972 --> 04:33.141
"Embezzlement"?
That's fancy.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.985
- You must be the accountant.
- Who are you?

04:45.352 --> 04:46.486
Open the safe.

04:46.621 --> 04:49.757
Oh, baby, baby,
you swiped right!

04:49.891 --> 04:51.592
I'm your girlfriend now!

04:53.460 --> 04:55.696
Everything on the bottom row.
Let's go.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.169
You're not cut out for this.
I recommend a new line of work.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.874
Bosley!

05:07.008 --> 05:09.177
Evening, Angels.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.580
Well, all this looks
very promising.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.115
Outstanding.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.951
But what about
Australian Jonny?

05:17.084 --> 05:18.418
Ta-da!

05:18.553 --> 05:20.154
- Oh, you're gonna regret this.
- Yeah.

05:20.288 --> 05:21.756
I was gonna
give you the world.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.958
The thing is, is you just talk
way too much.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.294
You're super clingy
and come on way too strong.

05:26.426 --> 05:27.895
You are the most
incredible woman

05:28.029 --> 05:29.831
- I've ever met.
- I know.

05:29.964 --> 05:32.567
So that's four months'
surveillance, two countries

05:32.700 --> 05:35.970
and the most embarrassing date
I have ever been on in my life.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.872
- Are we good?
- I will address this

05:38.005 --> 05:40.141
to the
U.S. Justice Department,

05:40.274 --> 05:43.476
along with, uh,
all your new friends here.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.847
- We're good to go.
- Sweet.

05:45.980 --> 05:48.182
I'm out of here, man.
I'm gonna take a week off,

05:48.316 --> 05:49.884
party my ass off
on a Thai beach.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.519
Jane,
you should give it a shot:

05:51.652 --> 05:53.988
beaches, letting someone
play with your, uh...

05:55.455 --> 05:57.525
I have fun
in my own ways.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.392
Oh. Cool.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.495
You sharpen
your samurai swords at night?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.065
Cosplay Catwoman?

06:04.198 --> 06:05.867
I'd actually pay
to see that.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.002
Occasionally eat gluten
at night and feel...

06:09.503 --> 06:10.838
That was fun.

06:10.972 --> 06:12.506
So who were they?

06:12.640 --> 06:16.043
You were in the presence
of Angels.

06:17.178 --> 06:19.213
But the question is, Jonny...

06:21.182 --> 06:23.251
who are you?

07:19.707 --> 07:21.474
Hey, Ingrid.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.544
You are late.
Mr. Fleming is waiting.

07:23.678 --> 07:25.313
Oh, wasn't the meeting
set for 9?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.215
Yes, 9 a.m. is when
the meeting starts,

07:28.349 --> 07:30.785
which is exactly now.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.254
Have you ever spent time
with him? Mr. Brok?

07:33.387 --> 07:34.487
No, of course not.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.990
He had me over
to his chÃ¢teau,

07:36.123 --> 07:37.525
which is in France.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.460
And we were sitting there,
and I'm asking him,

07:40.594 --> 07:44.899
I said, "Mr. Brok, have you
ever heard of Humphry Davy?"

07:45.032 --> 07:46.434
- And he says, "No."
- Oh.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.903
I say, "Have you ever
heard of Joseph Swan

07:49.036 --> 07:51.806
or Alexander Lodygin?"
"No clue."

07:51.939 --> 07:53.407
So I say, "Okay.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.143
Uh, what about
Thomas Edison?"

07:56.277 --> 07:59.313
"Well, of course. Who hasn't?
He invented the light bulb."

07:59.447 --> 08:01.148
- Right? But guess what?
- Uh...

08:01.282 --> 08:03.117
So did those
other three guys.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.852
Before Edison.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.655
But Edison
was first to market.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.890
Do you see my point?

08:10.024 --> 08:11.993
We have a product that will

08:12.126 --> 08:14.662
revolutionize
the power industry.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.464
But we have to be first.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.199
The time is now.

08:18.332 --> 08:22.169
And that's what I told Mr. Brok,
and he agrees with me.

08:22.303 --> 08:23.871
Obviously.

08:24.005 --> 08:26.173
- I...
- Elena, thank you for coming in.

08:26.307 --> 08:27.842
I love how
this conversation went.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.777
Technically, I haven't
said anything.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.145
Let's not get caught in
a game of who said what.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.648
Mr. Fleming, I know how
important Calisto is, okay?

08:34.782 --> 08:36.851
I'm the lead programmer on it.
It's my baby.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.552
- Yeah.
- But as I wrote in my report,

08:38.686 --> 08:40.087
right now
there is a possibility

08:40.221 --> 08:42.356
for the harmonic range
to be reversed.

08:42.490 --> 08:44.392
We both know how dangerous
that could be.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.228
Well, I mean, you don't know
what I know. Heh.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.497
Y-you know Julio?
The second engineer?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.266
He's actually still in hospital
after a brain seizure,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.668
and he was only partially
exposed during a test.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.505
Allegedly. Allegedly.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.173
And Julio was an idiot.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.875
All I need is root access

09:01.008 --> 09:02.676
and time
to permanently fix the flaw

09:02.810 --> 09:04.645
in the blockchain
so it will stay safe...

09:06.113 --> 09:08.482
Ingrid,
can I get a cappuccino?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.551
Okay. I read your report.

09:10.684 --> 09:14.355
I've had others
read your report.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.557
We just simply
disagree with you.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.528
Has Mr. Brok read my report?
I think that if he read...

09:19.660 --> 09:22.663
Let me be crystal clear here.

09:22.797 --> 09:24.865
We have developed Calisto
for five years,

09:24.999 --> 09:26.734
and we are going to market.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.036
It is safe and it is ready,

09:29.170 --> 09:31.105
and that's what
we're telling Mr. Brok.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.909
And you are telling
Mr. Brok nothing.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.481
Look, Elena,
you're much too smart

09:40.614 --> 09:42.983
to keep pushing
this forward, aren't you?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.589
Good.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.666
- I knew who Humphry Davy was.
- Good for you.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.576
- You dropped something.
- Oh, no. That's not mine.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.711
Well, I don't litter,
so it must be yours.

10:12.581 --> 10:14.281
You might need it.

10:43.244 --> 10:44.678
Bosley, 001.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.662
You old codger.
You really thought

11:01.795 --> 11:04.999
we were gonna let you
just sneak away quietly?

11:05.132 --> 11:06.568
You didn't have to.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.935
It's not just me.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.705
<i>Surprise!</i>

11:11.839 --> 11:14.008
Surprise!

11:14.141 --> 11:16.810
- Hey! Bonjour.
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as, seÃ±or.</i>

11:16.944 --> 11:19.113
- <i>Buenos dÃ­as.</i>
- Gang's all here.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.116
We all wanted to wish you
a happy retirement.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.384
Thank you, Bosley.

11:23.518 --> 11:24.485
- And you, sir.
- Bosley.

11:24.619 --> 11:26.387
Bosley. Thank you.

11:26.521 --> 11:28.189
- You!
- You've had one hell of a run.

11:28.322 --> 11:29.790
It deserves to be celebrated.

11:29.924 --> 11:32.293
I even put together
a little walk down memory lane.

11:32.426 --> 11:33.961
- Shall we? Ha, ha!
- Oh, no, no.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.963
Here it comes.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.165
Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!

11:38.299 --> 11:40.868
- Fresh-faced Oxford graduate.
- Yeah!

11:41.001 --> 11:43.170
- Oh, Lord.
- I dug deep. Look at that.

11:43.304 --> 11:44.838
That's not a disguise.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.208
You clearly had a
lot of fun over the years.

11:47.341 --> 11:49.343
You know,
life was good in those days.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.945
Where did you get that suit?

11:51.078 --> 11:52.346
Monte Carlo.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.215
It really happened.
There's the proof.

11:56.317 --> 11:58.819
Well, when you opened
the European offices,

11:58.953 --> 12:01.188
you took the Townsend Agency
international.

12:01.322 --> 12:03.625
None of us would be here
without you.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.060
- Yes.
- Especially me. Thank you.

12:06.193 --> 12:10.097
Well, I'm very touched.
Thank you. All of you.

12:10.231 --> 12:12.534
<i>Say a few words. Come on,
speech, Bosley. Speech!</i>

12:12.667 --> 12:14.935
- Oh, no.
- <i>Speech, speech, speech!</i>

12:15.069 --> 12:17.706
<i>Speech, speech, speech!</i>

12:17.838 --> 12:18.906
Uh...

12:20.307 --> 12:23.043
Well, frankly,
I am overwhelmed.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.515
I'm grateful...

12:27.649 --> 12:31.118
for all the work
that we have done together.

12:31.252 --> 12:33.954
And, you know,
Charlie wasn't sure

12:34.088 --> 12:35.889
that we could replicate
the success

12:36.023 --> 12:38.192
that he had
here in California.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.227
- But we made it work...
- That's right.

12:40.361 --> 12:44.999
...in a world that was
really not ready for the Angels.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.301
For 40 years,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.504
I recruited them,
I trained them...

12:50.739 --> 12:52.439
and I'm so very proud
of them.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.510
Bosleys...

12:55.644 --> 12:57.746
- you keep them safe.
- Will do.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.980
- Hear, hear.
- <i>We will, my friend.</i>

13:00.114 --> 13:03.317
And so for me,
as Charlie said,

13:03.450 --> 13:05.486
time to make
an exit stage left.

13:05.620 --> 13:08.255
Wha... Ah,
speaking of Charlie...

13:09.456 --> 13:10.858
<i>Hello, Bosley.</i>

13:10.991 --> 13:12.493
Hello, Charlie.

13:12.627 --> 13:14.962
<i>If you look around this room,
old friend,</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:16.497
<i>you'll see the men and women</i>

13:16.631 --> 13:19.266
<i>who will carry your legacy
into the future.</i>

13:19.400 --> 13:23.070
<i>Your leadership and commitment
is unparalleled.</i>

13:23.203 --> 13:25.906
<i>We owe you a debt
we cannot repay.</i>

13:26.040 --> 13:28.142
<i>So instead,
we got you a watch.</i>

13:29.711 --> 13:31.345
- A watch?
- Yes.

13:32.647 --> 13:35.115
- Oh!
- Thank you, Charlie.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.519
<i>Enjoy your retirement.</i>

13:37.652 --> 13:39.186
<i>You deserve it.</i>

13:39.320 --> 13:41.488
A toast!

13:41.623 --> 13:43.490
You really like to party.

13:43.625 --> 13:46.226
It's the day drinking.
That's what I like the most.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.995
You're not bad either.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.798
<i>To Bosley.</i>

13:49.930 --> 13:52.032
- To Bosley!
- To all of you.

14:01.475 --> 14:05.012
âª This speech is my recital
I think it's very vital âª

14:05.145 --> 14:08.015
âª To rock a rhyme, that's right
On time, "It's Tricky" is... âª

14:08.148 --> 14:10.384
Thank you. That's it.
Please move. He's coming.

14:10.518 --> 14:12.554
- For sure.
- Are we ready? Thank you.

14:12.687 --> 14:14.054
That was a sick flow,
bro.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.323
- Oh, shut up, shut up.
- You really went for it.

14:16.457 --> 14:17.692
There's two seats over there.

14:17.826 --> 14:18.992
- âª It's tricky âª
- âª Tricky âª

14:19.126 --> 14:20.060
- âª Tricky âª
- âª Tricky âª

14:20.194 --> 14:21.895
Langston, shut up.

14:22.029 --> 14:26.200
Everyone, please help me
welcome our founder,

14:26.333 --> 14:29.136
our benefactor,
Alexander Brok.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.843
Mr. Brok, you have set

14:34.975 --> 14:38.312
the highest standards
for innovation.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.181
I believe that I, along
with a little help from my team,

14:41.315 --> 14:44.151
have met that challenge.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.622
Today, I instructed
the Hamburg power utility

14:47.756 --> 14:51.760
to disconnect this building
from the electrical grid.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.429
But we are far from
powerless.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.433
Mr. Brok,

14:59.567 --> 15:01.703
would you grant us
root access?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.272
<i>Hello, Alexander.</i>

15:05.406 --> 15:07.074
<i>Root access granted.</i>

15:07.207 --> 15:09.878
Calisto,
turn on the lights.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.381
Calisto, pair
with sister devices.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.086
Calisto, full power.

15:26.861 --> 15:29.062
Brok Industries
can power the world.

15:35.837 --> 15:38.972
So you went with
rare-earth magnetics in the end?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.073
Ah, yes.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.276
Inside a cyanide
crystal matrix.

15:43.745 --> 15:46.581
- It's kyanite, but...
- Kyanite.

15:46.714 --> 15:48.783
- Um, may I?
- Please.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.852
You delivered on
the safety protocols?

15:50.984 --> 15:55.122
Oh, absolutely. Calisto only
talks with electrical circuitry.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.192
The current never touches
people, pets, plants.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.294
It's smart, and it's safe.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.797
Although, uh, in the spirit
of full disclosure,

16:02.931 --> 16:05.834
I should mention
one small thing.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.604
It can be manufactured
in pastel colors for the ladies.

16:13.474 --> 16:14.676
You...

16:14.809 --> 16:18.847
Ah, well, this is it.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.150
We can bring clean energy
to everyone.

16:23.918 --> 16:25.185
Sustainably.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.490
Calisto is the future.

16:29.624 --> 16:32.794
And I am holding the future
in my hands, finally.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.697
Good work, guys.

16:36.798 --> 16:38.465
Good work.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.702
Come on, let's celebrate.
Drinks in the bar!

16:44.572 --> 16:47.274
Keep your form. Block.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.475
One, two.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.014
Let's take this one off.
Make it tighter.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.683
Okay.

16:58.553 --> 16:59.821
Thanks.

16:59.954 --> 17:02.222
Paris is not so bad, right?

17:02.260 --> 17:04.915
Did you take the apartment
with the good light?

17:04.992 --> 17:07.127
Yes. But if you get me a plant...

17:07.189 --> 17:08.596
- I'm just gonna kill it.
- Of course.

17:09.897 --> 17:10.765
<i>D'accord, d'accord.</i>

17:10.898 --> 17:12.534
I'm ready for a new assignment.

17:12.666 --> 17:15.770
Listen,
I've set a meeting with a new client.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.171
A corporate whistle-blower.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.207
Putting a team together.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.876
- A... A team?
- Yes.

17:22.010 --> 17:23.711
Hey, Bosley.

17:23.845 --> 17:26.346
- You wanted to see me, right?
- Ah, yes.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.414
Oh, hey.

17:27.549 --> 17:31.218
You're the former
MI6 ninja.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.319
Is it June?

17:32.452 --> 17:33.721
Oh, Jane.

17:33.855 --> 17:36.390
Oh, Jane. Jane.
Not the month.

17:36.524 --> 17:37.491
Sabrina?

17:37.625 --> 17:39.561
Sabina. It's Italian.

17:39.694 --> 17:41.663
Oh, are you Italian?

17:41.796 --> 17:43.363
No. I... Maybe...

17:43.497 --> 17:46.099
We have a situation in Hamburg,
a new client.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.504
Hamburg. Interestingly, not
where hamburgers were invented.

17:49.637 --> 17:50.939
That was in Frankfurt,

17:51.071 --> 17:53.140
where frankfurters were
not invented, which...

17:53.273 --> 17:56.109
- I don't think that this is...
- I'm sorry. I'm vegetarian.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.412
Thank you very much.
But I recall hearing

17:58.546 --> 18:00.380
you two worked
well together in Rio.

18:00.515 --> 18:02.884
I recall her
pushing me off a roof.

18:03.017 --> 18:04.986
I recall
it was time to go.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.722
Heh. That makes sense.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.657
Who's the client?

18:12.026 --> 18:13.061
Follow me.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.462
- Elena?
- Hi.

18:48.596 --> 18:49.897
Welcome.

18:50.031 --> 18:51.331
Uh, Mr. Bosley?

18:51.465 --> 18:54.669
- Just Bosley.
- Thank you for seeing me. Um...

18:57.137 --> 19:00.173
- Would you like anything?
- Uh, espresso, <i>bitte.</i>

19:00.307 --> 19:01.843
<i>Merci, Ã§a va.</i>

19:03.978 --> 19:05.379
Espresso.

19:05.513 --> 19:07.015
COS perimeter check.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.616
"COS"?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.985
I have less than no idea
what that means,

19:11.119 --> 19:14.022
but you are good up here.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.657
I would say,

19:15.790 --> 19:17.491
the coast is clear.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.459
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

19:19.594 --> 19:21.062
I have thought
about this a lot.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.031
All we have to do
is get it to Mr. Brok.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.066
<i>And I have tried
to contact him.</i>

19:25.198 --> 19:28.002
Well, it takes a lot
to come forward,

19:28.136 --> 19:30.705
and I appreciate
your courage.

19:30.838 --> 19:33.007
You sure you wanna
take this risk?

19:34.408 --> 19:36.010
Yeah.

19:36.144 --> 19:38.112
Okay, we can help you.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.115
- It's just getting out of hand.
- Stop it, you're so cute.

19:42.750 --> 19:43.785
I gotta get a dog.

19:45.086 --> 19:46.921
<i>I can't sleep at night,</i>

19:47.055 --> 19:50.558
<i>knowing and not being allowed
to do or say anything about it.</i>

19:53.427 --> 19:54.729
I can fix it,

19:54.862 --> 19:57.065
but I just need
the opportunity.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.333
I believe you. Were you able
to get the evidence?

20:03.871 --> 20:05.506
All my reports, all my data.

20:19.137 --> 20:20.567
What can I bring you?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.869
Your check, sir.

20:35.002 --> 20:36.436
Was that the signal?

20:36.571 --> 20:38.438
- Elena...
- <i>What's happening?</i>

20:38.573 --> 20:40.174
You need to go
to the ladies' room.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.844
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Quickly.

20:45.213 --> 20:47.081
<i>Hey, what's happening? Jane?</i>

20:47.215 --> 20:48.516
Now!

20:50.383 --> 20:52.385
Hello... Oh, shit!

20:52.520 --> 20:53.755
Shit!

20:58.926 --> 21:02.262
Ah! Shit, shit, shit!

21:55.382 --> 21:56.517
That's my gun.

22:03.124 --> 22:04.992
Sabina! Hurry!

22:05.126 --> 22:06.027
- Go!
- Go!

22:08.529 --> 22:11.364
Yeah! Evac the client!
That's what I was gonna say!

22:11.498 --> 22:12.900
Whoa!

22:16.804 --> 22:17.905
What's going on?

22:18.039 --> 22:20.541
- Oh, God. You're not a waitress?
- No.

22:20.675 --> 22:23.511
I'm Jane. Nice to meet you.

22:23.644 --> 22:25.880
- Did you bring the big gun?
- In the back.

22:26.013 --> 22:28.683
- Can you move your feet?
- Oh, sure. Mm-hm.

22:28.816 --> 22:30.551
Oh, do you know how
to use that?

22:37.625 --> 22:38.826
Motherfucker!

22:38.960 --> 22:41.361
Oh, my God!
Is he shooting at us?!

22:45.700 --> 22:48.169
- Hold on, ladies.
- Whoa!

22:52.840 --> 22:53.975
Whoa!

22:59.680 --> 23:03.084
Is that a tank? Oh, my God.
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

23:03.217 --> 23:05.720
- I think we lost him!
- Bit much for just this girl, no?

23:05.853 --> 23:06.921
Who is this chick?

23:07.054 --> 23:08.022
Who am I?!

23:08.155 --> 23:09.389
Who are you?! Who is he?

23:09.523 --> 23:11.225
And why is he
shooting at us?

23:11.359 --> 23:12.459
Keep it steady.

23:12.593 --> 23:14.128
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die.

23:17.031 --> 23:18.099
Oh, no! He's back!

23:42.223 --> 23:43.257
Oh, my God!

23:48.362 --> 23:49.363
Oh, shit!

23:55.870 --> 23:56.971
<i>Merde!</i>

24:10.217 --> 24:11.451
Stay low. Stay low.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.293
- Do a J-turn on my mark.
- Ready.

24:19.427 --> 24:20.761
Now!

24:37.578 --> 24:39.113
Bosley.

25:44.678 --> 25:46.047
Stay down!

25:48.616 --> 25:49.550
Jane!

25:51.786 --> 25:53.522
Hey, I said, stay down!

25:53.687 --> 25:55.156
Hey! Stop moving!

26:34.962 --> 26:36.831
Sandwich?

26:36.964 --> 26:38.466
It's tuna.

26:38.599 --> 26:41.769
Unless it's cheese,
and it's not good.

26:49.578 --> 26:51.612
How about you?
You hungry?

27:15.269 --> 27:16.837
Charlie sends love, Angels.

27:16.971 --> 27:20.274
Who is she?
Who is she?

27:20.407 --> 27:23.043
Hey, she's in shock,
and she smells like puke.

27:23.177 --> 27:24.178
Who are you?

27:24.311 --> 27:26.647
- I'm Bosley.
- Bosley?

27:26.780 --> 27:28.883
Bosley's a rank
in our organization.

27:29.016 --> 27:31.652
It's like a lieutenant.

27:31.785 --> 27:34.488
The real name of the man
you met was Edgar Dessange.

27:36.257 --> 27:37.725
Edgar.

27:41.929 --> 27:44.031
Jane, I'm really sorry.

27:44.165 --> 27:47.101
- I know how much he meant to you.
- Oh, I don't need a hug.

27:49.770 --> 27:51.772
Well, I do.

27:51.906 --> 27:53.608
He was my friend too.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.281
Hugs work.

28:05.252 --> 28:07.488
Okay, let's get you
cleaned up.

28:07.622 --> 28:09.023
Come on.

28:09.156 --> 28:10.559
Is that a stolen car?

28:11.859 --> 28:12.860
Okay.

28:14.161 --> 28:16.864
Bosley, 342.
Open Safe House 6.

28:23.804 --> 28:26.541
Boz, who else knew we were
meeting with Elena in Hamburg?

28:26.675 --> 28:29.176
Well, protocol would
be not to tell anyone.

28:29.310 --> 28:30.945
Why do you ask?

28:31.078 --> 28:32.746
Well, Bosley...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.115
Edgar thought...

28:37.151 --> 28:38.919
Okay, you didn't see
this guy.

28:39.053 --> 28:41.255
He was a pro, and he brought
a lot of firepower

28:41.388 --> 28:42.524
for such an easy target.

28:42.657 --> 28:44.258
Yeah, he was so extra, right?

28:44.391 --> 28:46.460
I could take that girl out
with a flyswatter.

28:46.595 --> 28:48.862
He rocks up in this
urban assault vehicle.

28:48.996 --> 28:51.566
So we're thinking what?
He was...

28:51.700 --> 28:54.401
Maybe she was
being watched...

28:54.536 --> 28:55.869
but what if we are?

28:56.003 --> 28:59.608
- And by who?
- Hey, you guys. All cleaned up.

28:59.740 --> 29:02.677
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

29:02.810 --> 29:05.112
I'm kind of getting this,
you know.

29:05.246 --> 29:08.115
You guys are
like lady spies and...

29:08.249 --> 29:10.751
I just need you to explain
who this guy is

29:10.884 --> 29:13.787
- and why was he shooting at you.
- Oh, you.

29:13.921 --> 29:16.524
- He was shooting at you.
- Jane.

29:18.092 --> 29:19.827
At me?

29:19.960 --> 29:21.495
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

29:21.630 --> 29:23.632
- Okay.
- Just have some tea.

29:23.764 --> 29:26.400
The shooter's a ghost.
Facial recognition's popped him

29:26.534 --> 29:30.672
in a few places over the years
but no name, no record, nothing.

29:30.804 --> 29:32.473
He's got friends
in high places.

29:32.607 --> 29:35.476
- I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm obliged to remind you,

29:35.610 --> 29:37.579
Charlie frowns on revenge,
Jane.

29:37.712 --> 29:39.813
So, Ms. Houghlin,

29:39.947 --> 29:43.917
your file says you are a systems
engineer on the Calisto project.

29:44.051 --> 29:45.953
Uh, you know about Calisto?

29:46.086 --> 29:48.222
We know about
a lot of things.

29:48.355 --> 29:50.791
That you graduated top
of your class at MIT,

29:50.924 --> 29:53.127
you take Krav Maga,
you ride your bike to work.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.995
You think yellow
is one of your colors

29:55.129 --> 29:56.230
when, in fact,
it's no one's.

29:56.363 --> 29:58.165
That you could be dating more

29:58.299 --> 30:01.402
if you played up the cheekbones
in your online profile pictures.

30:01.536 --> 30:05.105
What we don't know is
why someone wants you dead.

30:05.239 --> 30:07.341
<i>I know it can be fixed.</i>

30:07.474 --> 30:10.010
<i>Let's take this
one step at a time.</i>

30:10.144 --> 30:12.146
<i>There's a flaw in the system.</i>

30:12.279 --> 30:13.615
What's the flaw?

30:14.915 --> 30:16.183
Calisto can be weaponized.

30:17.918 --> 30:19.820
I mean, I can fix it.
But right now,

30:19.953 --> 30:22.122
any decent hacker,
curious or criminal enough,

30:22.256 --> 30:25.660
could turn Calisto into an EMP
on the human body.

30:25.794 --> 30:27.294
An electromagnetic pulse.

30:27.428 --> 30:28.797
A brain seizure,
essentially.

30:28.929 --> 30:30.831
- Yes.
- See? I know stuff.

30:30.964 --> 30:32.667
It disrupts
the neural networks

30:32.801 --> 30:34.736
and looks like
a stroke or an aneurysm.

30:34.868 --> 30:37.204
So it can be used
without a trace of evidence.

30:37.338 --> 30:39.306
A perfect
assassination machine.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.543
Yeah.
And it can be triggered remotely

30:41.676 --> 30:44.579
across the network
that I created.

30:44.713 --> 30:46.347
Dope. See, that
is what you can do

30:46.480 --> 30:48.982
- if you pay attention in school.
- Who knows about this?

30:49.116 --> 30:52.353
I filed a report after
it almost killed my colleague

30:52.486 --> 30:55.724
during a security test,
but I think it was buried.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.726
My report,
not my colleague. No.

30:57.858 --> 30:59.561
Julio is fine. He, uh...

30:59.694 --> 31:01.730
He just can't speak
or see color anymore.

31:01.862 --> 31:03.364
It's not in production yet?

31:03.497 --> 31:06.634
No, we're behind schedule,
but there are six prototypes

31:06.768 --> 31:09.069
in the Brok facility vault,
plus the one at my lab

31:09.203 --> 31:11.238
that I was using
to program the fix, which...

31:11.372 --> 31:13.207
Let's get those prototypes
out of there.

31:13.340 --> 31:16.644
Uh, I'm sorry. Can we just
hit pause for a second, please?

31:16.778 --> 31:18.212
Does your company
have a website

31:18.345 --> 31:20.147
with an employee directory
with photos?

31:20.280 --> 31:23.050
Yes, but Brok Industries is
equipped with insane security.

31:23.183 --> 31:24.719
- There's no way...
- There we go.

31:24.853 --> 31:27.020
Do you think she still has
security clearance?

31:27.154 --> 31:28.489
If she doesn't,
we'll know

31:28.623 --> 31:30.725
the threat comes from within,
so either way...

31:30.859 --> 31:34.061
- We get the information we need.
- No, no, no.

31:34.194 --> 31:35.929
No, no.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.198
- Ooh!
- No.

31:38.332 --> 31:40.467
- No, no, no.
- I...

31:40.602 --> 31:42.136
Huh. Hm...

31:42.269 --> 31:44.972
- Bowl cuts.
- Bowl cuts.

31:45.105 --> 31:46.273
Bowl cuts.

31:48.510 --> 31:49.644
Bowl cuts.

32:05.058 --> 32:06.694
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

32:06.828 --> 32:08.462
Just trying
to get to work, Ralph.

32:08.596 --> 32:11.432
Well, I gotta do my job too.

32:12.700 --> 32:13.735
Okay.

32:16.370 --> 32:18.939
- New look, huh?
- Mm-hm.

32:19.072 --> 32:21.609
I like it a lot.

32:21.743 --> 32:24.278
Aren't you holding
people up, Ralph?

32:24.411 --> 32:26.413
Well...

32:26.548 --> 32:28.315
you have yourself
a good day.

32:28.449 --> 32:30.652
And don't... Don't forget
to smile, yeah?

33:03.317 --> 33:04.418
What?

33:06.921 --> 33:09.691
How...? How did you
even get in the...?

33:09.824 --> 33:12.594
Oh, God. What did
you do to Pradeep?

33:12.727 --> 33:13.994
Pradeep Prasad.

33:14.127 --> 33:16.363
<i>Nothing. Pradeep's fine.</i>

33:18.967 --> 33:22.269
<i>I nabbed his ID card
from the gym this morning.</i>

33:22.402 --> 33:24.104
Hi.

33:24.238 --> 33:26.039
Bye.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.242
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:30.310 --> 33:32.079
And Sven?

33:32.212 --> 33:33.581
<i>I compressed his carotid</i>

33:33.715 --> 33:35.550
<i>and deoxygenated
his brain stem.</i>

33:36.651 --> 33:37.752
<i>What?</i>

33:37.886 --> 33:39.721
Well, that sounds painful.

33:39.854 --> 33:41.355
Yeah, it's like
taking a nap.

33:41.488 --> 33:44.391
You smell burnt toast,
then everything goes dark.

33:44.526 --> 33:46.393
Hey, don't worry,
he's gonna wake up.

33:46.528 --> 33:48.095
Heh, unless he doesn't.

33:48.228 --> 33:49.898
- What...?
- We should go.

33:50.030 --> 33:52.366
If we're in the building
when they do their sweep,

33:52.499 --> 33:53.868
we're going
to German prison.

33:54.002 --> 33:55.937
Hm, and then it's schnitzel.
All the time.

33:56.069 --> 33:57.505
Not such a bad deal,
actually.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.641
Sabina, you get Calisto
from the vault.

33:59.774 --> 34:01.809
Elena, you get the prototype
from your lab.

34:01.943 --> 34:03.511
I'll keep security
distracted.

34:03.645 --> 34:06.046
Okay. You ready?

34:06.179 --> 34:08.148
Yeah. High five.
Girl power.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.889
Oh.

34:15.023 --> 34:16.658
Thank you.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.664
No puking.

34:55.195 --> 34:56.630
Buggy piece of shit.

35:10.578 --> 35:12.647
Whoa... No.

35:14.281 --> 35:16.316
- Boz, you with us?
- I'm here. What do you got?

35:16.450 --> 35:18.418
Calisto's gone.
It's not here.

35:18.553 --> 35:19.787
<i>Someone beat us to it.</i>

35:19.921 --> 35:21.789
The plot thickens.
Can you get an ID?

35:27.962 --> 35:30.130
There we go. Some guy.
Peter Fleming.

35:30.263 --> 35:32.000
Let's see what Elena
comes back with.

35:34.301 --> 35:37.437
Hold up. We might have
another problem.

35:37.572 --> 35:39.841
Your boy Pradeep
just showed up.

35:39.974 --> 35:41.441
Pradeep didn't spin?

35:41.576 --> 35:43.811
But he signed up
for the Groupon and everything.

35:43.945 --> 35:45.178
Well, he's here.

35:49.851 --> 35:50.852
- Ralph?
- Yeah?

35:50.985 --> 35:52.352
We've got
Pradeep Prasad here.

35:52.486 --> 35:54.187
The system says
he's in the building.

35:54.321 --> 35:55.657
Yeah, there's a glitch.

35:55.790 --> 35:58.960
The computer
thinks Elena Houghlin is...

36:00.762 --> 36:03.497
Right now, I'm sending you
an image of Elena Houghlin.

36:03.631 --> 36:05.198
Get it to all our guys.
I want her

36:05.332 --> 36:07.167
- detained for questioning.
- Yes.

36:30.792 --> 36:33.027
She's in her lab.

36:33.161 --> 36:34.361
Let's go.

36:43.071 --> 36:44.906
And here comes
the cavalry.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.942
The heat is assembling,
ladies.

36:49.177 --> 36:51.378
Oh, they know.

36:51.512 --> 36:53.346
All right, meet me
at the pickup.

36:57.752 --> 36:59.754
Sabina?
This one's real hard.

36:59.887 --> 37:03.124
I need you to exhibit
some attention-seeking behavior.

37:04.826 --> 37:06.194
I have so many ideas.

37:10.898 --> 37:11.833
Houghlin?

37:13.901 --> 37:14.936
Where is she?

37:16.204 --> 37:17.705
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

37:17.839 --> 37:19.406
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

37:19.540 --> 37:20.875
- Now I got her.
- Where?

37:21.008 --> 37:22.176
Here.

37:23.310 --> 37:24.779
Eleven?

37:24.912 --> 37:27.380
Guys, she's on 11.
Level 11, women's restroom.

37:37.091 --> 37:38.760
Hi. Uh, who are you?

37:38.893 --> 37:41.062
Shh. Sit down.
Hands where I can see them.

37:46.801 --> 37:49.302
Are you with Health and Safety?

37:49.436 --> 37:51.906
God, these things
are impossible to open.

37:54.809 --> 37:59.080
Um, you're really not supposed
to be touching things in here

37:59.213 --> 38:01.949
unless you're supposed to be
touching things in here.

38:10.691 --> 38:13.227
You put your mouth on it.

38:13.360 --> 38:16.731
Twenty billion bacteria
reside in the human mouth.

38:18.266 --> 38:19.567
You're adorable.

38:20.935 --> 38:23.336
Jane?
Jane, is that you flirting?

38:35.216 --> 38:36.284
Hey!

38:37.417 --> 38:39.287
Stop! Hey!

38:40.655 --> 38:41.789
Hey!

39:14.255 --> 39:15.189
Oh, come on.

39:37.278 --> 39:38.346
You ready?

39:43.551 --> 39:45.286
Hey! Hey!

39:46.721 --> 39:48.455
- Sorry!
- Hey!

39:49.557 --> 39:51.458
Oh, my God!

39:51.592 --> 39:52.894
Get back here!

39:55.897 --> 39:56.864
Who has eyes on her?

39:56.998 --> 39:58.032
She set a fire on four.

39:58.165 --> 39:59.533
We are following her
to three.

39:59.667 --> 40:03.070
- Let's go, guys! Come on.
- Three? She was on 11.

40:04.238 --> 40:06.774
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

40:08.509 --> 40:10.278
What did you...?

40:10.410 --> 40:13.080
- Hold this.
- Okay.

40:13.214 --> 40:15.448
Oh, that's...
That's not you.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.951
No.

40:18.686 --> 40:21.022
- Hold this.
- Okay.

40:21.155 --> 40:23.224
Can you unzip me?

40:23.357 --> 40:24.859
Yeah, yeah. Uh...

40:26.227 --> 40:27.128
Sorry.

40:32.900 --> 40:34.802
Bye.

40:34.936 --> 40:36.871
- You don't want your...?
- Keep it!

41:01.295 --> 41:02.763
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Susan.

41:02.897 --> 41:05.199
Mr. Fleming would like you
in the lab right away.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.867
- <i>I'll be right there.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.

41:07.001 --> 41:08.970
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

41:09.103 --> 41:10.805
Not on-screen. With your eyes!

41:10.938 --> 41:12.873
- You go there, you go there. Now!
- Okay!

41:15.609 --> 41:16.777
<i>I'm out.</i>

41:16.911 --> 41:17.845
I'm out.

41:20.614 --> 41:23.150
- Main lobby. I see her!
- Where?!

41:24.452 --> 41:26.486
Lobby level.
Lobby level!

41:26.620 --> 41:28.889
Let's go, guys. Come on!

41:29.023 --> 41:30.958
Put your hands
where I can see them.

41:32.259 --> 41:33.627
Get on the ground! Now!

41:33.761 --> 41:34.996
Let me see your hands!

41:35.129 --> 41:36.530
- Do it!
- What for?

41:36.664 --> 41:38.332
I don't know.
I don't know! Ah!

41:38.466 --> 41:41.268
I don't know what for.
What are you looking for? Ah!

41:41.402 --> 41:42.703
Sorry, Susan.

41:47.541 --> 41:50.244
"Susan Olsen."

41:50.378 --> 41:54.081
Put all the exits on lockdown.
Sweep from the bottom up.

41:54.215 --> 41:55.850
Jane. I got it.

41:55.983 --> 41:58.519
The unit's gone. We need to go.
Someone beat us to it.

41:58.652 --> 42:00.388
Are you kidding?
They were stolen?

42:00.521 --> 42:02.223
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh!

42:02.356 --> 42:04.892
- Oh!
- God!

42:05.026 --> 42:06.994
Any ideas?
Is there another way out?

42:07.128 --> 42:09.263
Wait, wait. I can hack this.

42:09.397 --> 42:12.501
Turn it into an EMP, overload
the electronics in the door.

42:12.633 --> 42:14.268
Won't that kill us
in the process?

42:14.402 --> 42:17.506
It's short proximity. We should
be okay if we keep our distance.

42:17.638 --> 42:19.707
- How far?
- Uh...

42:19.840 --> 42:21.142
Here is far enough, I guess.

42:21.275 --> 42:23.044
You guess?
Do scientists usually guess?

42:23.177 --> 42:26.013
Of course. It's the first step
in the scientific method.

42:26.147 --> 42:28.315
Hypothesis.

42:28.449 --> 42:30.551
Calisto, short-range
power burst.

42:30.684 --> 42:32.753
Okay, it's powering up.
It's powering up.

42:37.358 --> 42:38.692
This should work.

42:43.497 --> 42:45.166
- Ralph.
- No.

42:45.299 --> 42:46.233
God.

42:49.270 --> 42:50.539
- I have time.
- No.

42:50.671 --> 42:53.741
- I have to. I have to.
- No. No. Stay here!

42:53.874 --> 42:56.377
Ralph? Ralph.
Get over here now.

42:56.511 --> 42:58.446
- There you are.
- Ralph, it's about to blow.

42:58.579 --> 43:00.714
I can't stop it.
Get over here.

43:00.848 --> 43:02.551
You think
I'm gonna listen to you?

43:02.683 --> 43:06.053
- Ralph, come! Get over here now!
- Put hands where I can see them!

43:19.433 --> 43:21.536
Let's get out of here.
Do we need that?

43:21.669 --> 43:23.404
- No, it's useless now.
- Then leave it.

43:23.538 --> 43:26.073
Move it or lose it, ladies.
Let's go. We gotta go.

43:26.207 --> 43:28.609
Come on, come on. Get in.

43:41.789 --> 43:43.724
Do you think
Ralph's gonna be okay?

43:45.059 --> 43:47.461
Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he's fine.

43:47.596 --> 43:49.663
- He seemed fine, right?
- Yeah.

43:49.797 --> 43:52.867
I'm sure... I'm sure he's okay.
I'm sure he's fine.

43:57.805 --> 44:01.008
Oh, well, that's a shame.

44:01.142 --> 44:03.477
Obviously, this is
a disappointing setback,

44:03.612 --> 44:06.280
but we have time.

44:06.413 --> 44:09.150
Do you know what?
Just get John on the phone.

44:09.283 --> 44:10.284
Now.

44:12.686 --> 44:14.855
Well, then wake him up.

44:19.793 --> 44:20.794
Everything all right?

44:23.497 --> 44:24.533
Can I have your phone?

45:04.639 --> 45:06.407
Bosley, 342.

45:22.022 --> 45:25.826
Welcome to the Berlin
outpost of the Townsend Agency.

45:25.960 --> 45:27.828
Is there food?
I'm starving.

45:27.962 --> 45:30.532
All women are starving
all the time.

45:33.367 --> 45:37.071
- <i>Mi chico.</i>
- Here they are. Welcome back.

45:37.204 --> 45:38.607
<i>Mi amor, como estas?</i>

45:38.739 --> 45:39.873
- Very <i>bien.</i>
- Good.

45:40.007 --> 45:41.775
- Cool.
- Well...

45:41.909 --> 45:43.511
Hey.

45:44.713 --> 45:46.581
You owe me a burpee now, okay?

45:48.215 --> 45:51.620
- Hey. Bombay sister. How are you?
- Master.

45:51.752 --> 45:53.220
Good to see you.

45:53.354 --> 45:55.055
- This is Elena.
- Pleasure to meet you.

45:55.189 --> 45:57.559
- Saint.
- Wow.

45:57.692 --> 46:00.928
Wow. You have
this beautiful energy.

46:01.061 --> 46:02.896
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

46:03.030 --> 46:05.399
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, wait, what?

46:05.533 --> 46:08.302
- Oh, my God. Yeah, um...
- Oh, no.

46:08.435 --> 46:11.573
I would love to apply
a firm touch to your back.

46:11.706 --> 46:13.941
- Do you consent?
- Yeah, sure.

46:14.074 --> 46:16.143
Okay. Just let me
try to find this.

46:17.478 --> 46:19.748
- Oh! Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

46:19.880 --> 46:20.848
- Oh.
- Good?

46:20.981 --> 46:22.584
Oh, yeah, yeah. Amazing.

46:22.717 --> 46:24.351
Displaced rib.
Very common.

46:24.485 --> 46:27.421
If you ever need additional
adjustments, I'm here for you.

46:27.555 --> 46:29.923
The Saint takes care
of our health and well-being.

46:30.057 --> 46:32.560
- Keeps us in fighting shape
- Yeah. Well, I try.

46:32.694 --> 46:35.095
He feeds our mind,
body and soul.

46:35.229 --> 46:38.132
Oh, should we take
a moment to remember Edgar?

46:39.266 --> 46:40.801
I prepared a mini feast

46:40.934 --> 46:44.004
to honor our beautiful friend.

46:44.138 --> 46:47.941
I got Pecorino Nero,
Parmigiano-Reggiano, Manchego,

46:48.075 --> 46:50.612
- and, of course...
- Thanks.

46:50.745 --> 46:52.112
- He loved Brie.
- Yeah.

46:52.246 --> 46:55.583
- Ah! And wine.
- Especially wine.

46:55.717 --> 46:57.652
Wow, I thought
you guys were gonna serve,

46:57.786 --> 46:59.453
like, bean sprouts
and wheatgrass.

46:59.587 --> 47:01.723
Eating is all
about the intention

47:01.855 --> 47:02.990
you put into your meal.

47:03.123 --> 47:04.358
If you honor the cow,

47:04.491 --> 47:06.860
the cheese is
gonna be good for you.

47:06.994 --> 47:08.962
By the way, I understand
the circumstances

47:09.096 --> 47:11.031
that brought you here
have been stressful.

47:11.165 --> 47:13.802
- So stressful.
- If you ever need to talk,

47:13.934 --> 47:15.336
I'm a licensed
psychotherapist.

47:15.469 --> 47:18.238
Wow. I can really see
why you guys call him...

47:18.372 --> 47:21.175
- The Saint.
- Yes. Okay.

47:21.308 --> 47:24.211
- Oh, electrolyte-enhanced water?
- Mm, fine.

47:24.345 --> 47:27.348
Oh, and also try this. It's
really good for your breath.

47:28.717 --> 47:30.951
- Oh, thank you.
- Good.

47:34.254 --> 47:36.825
I sent the ID of the last person
to access the vault

47:36.957 --> 47:39.193
through our search system,
ran every CCTV

47:39.326 --> 47:42.196
and security cam
in Hamburg.

47:42.329 --> 47:45.299
Fleming. That's my... That's
the guy that buried my report.

47:45.432 --> 47:47.702
- Hm.
- Look. There.

47:47.836 --> 47:50.137
He was at the airport
five hours ago.

47:50.270 --> 47:52.206
- So he's left Germany.
- With the case.

47:52.339 --> 47:54.174
He knows exactly
what Calisto can do.

47:54.308 --> 47:56.377
He knows what it's worth
on the black market.

47:56.511 --> 47:58.813
If he's selling it,
he'd want you out of the way.

47:58.946 --> 48:00.615
- I'm broadening the search.
- I'm sorry.

48:00.749 --> 48:02.216
Fleming tried
to have me killed?

48:02.349 --> 48:05.219
Maybe. Maybe at
the direction of a buyer.

48:05.352 --> 48:08.122
Bad guys don't like loose ends,
you made a fancy new toy...

48:08.255 --> 48:10.525
But I worked for him.
I mean...

48:12.426 --> 48:13.595
he flirted with me.

48:13.728 --> 48:15.195
Oh, honey.

48:15.329 --> 48:17.264
A man can love you
and want you dead.

48:17.398 --> 48:19.199
Ha, not me.

48:19.333 --> 48:21.034
There was a gunfight
at my wedding.

48:21.168 --> 48:24.271
- Wait, you're married?
- No. I was the better shot.

48:25.673 --> 48:26.974
All right. I need cheese.

48:27.107 --> 48:28.976
"Cheese." Is that
a code for something?

48:29.109 --> 48:31.780
Yes. It's code for
"I'm 40 and single,

48:31.912 --> 48:34.849
and I have a cheese-size hole
in my soul to fill."

48:34.982 --> 48:37.050
I also have vegan ice cream
for your soul.

48:37.184 --> 48:38.686
You really know what I need.

48:38.820 --> 48:40.555
I should have
just gone around Fleming

48:40.688 --> 48:43.090
and not followed
some stupid chain of command.

48:43.223 --> 48:47.094
Gone directly to Brok.
But, no, I just rolled over.

48:47.227 --> 48:48.696
You're probably
the last people

48:48.830 --> 48:50.532
that would know
what that feels like.

48:50.665 --> 48:53.066
I grew up with
major abandonment issues.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.402
It led to some pretty
self-sabotaging behavior,

48:55.537 --> 48:58.740
which landed me in various
institutional facilities.

48:58.873 --> 49:00.441
Charlie bailed me out.

49:00.575 --> 49:02.376
And if it wasn't
for Charlie...

49:04.211 --> 49:07.481
I'd probably be dead or back
in prison, so I feel you.

49:07.615 --> 49:11.251
I pretty much grew up on the
corner of powerless and ashamed.

49:11.385 --> 49:14.154
Wait. You grew up on Park
Avenue. Aren't you an heiress?

49:15.790 --> 49:17.692
More money, more problems.

49:17.826 --> 49:20.461
So, what about you?
How did Charlie find you?

49:20.595 --> 49:23.631
Jane is former MI6.
Youngest recruit ever.

49:23.765 --> 49:25.432
You worked
for British intelligence?

49:25.567 --> 49:27.502
She said "former."

49:27.635 --> 49:29.369
I also followed the rules.

49:29.504 --> 49:33.006
The chain of command didn't
work out so well for me either.

49:35.275 --> 49:37.010
Ralph's dead.

49:37.144 --> 49:38.947
I killed Ralph.

49:39.079 --> 49:40.247
I'm... I'm a murderer.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.583
- No.
- No, no, no.

49:41.716 --> 49:43.116
Collateral damage.

49:43.250 --> 49:44.819
I wouldn't take that on.

49:44.953 --> 49:48.455
The point is, if Calisto
falls in the wrong hands...

49:48.590 --> 49:52.125
I mean, we have to get it back
before it hurts more people.

49:54.328 --> 49:56.296
Well, now's our chance.

49:56.430 --> 49:59.299
Mr. Fleming just cleared
passport control in Istanbul.

50:00.467 --> 50:02.804
- Oh, no.
- No.

50:02.937 --> 50:04.772
What's your problem
with Istanbul?

50:04.906 --> 50:06.841
I got food poisoning
from undercooked lamb

50:06.975 --> 50:09.376
and yogurt sauce I left out,
but then I got hungry.

50:09.511 --> 50:12.412
- What about you?
- Not that.

50:12.547 --> 50:13.715
Will you excuse us?

50:16.149 --> 50:17.585
We'll be right back.

50:20.153 --> 50:24.091
I wanna be sure that assassin
stays away from us.

50:24.224 --> 50:27.227
We should keep this quiet until
we know who all the players are.

50:27.361 --> 50:29.731
We don't know what this
Calisto is or who wants it,

50:29.864 --> 50:32.199
so let's play it safe.

50:32.332 --> 50:35.168
What about
Ralph-killer in there?

50:35.302 --> 50:37.572
Take her to the closet,
gear her up.

50:37.705 --> 50:41.543
And if anybody asks,
we're going to Brazil.

50:41.676 --> 50:43.578
Okay.

50:59.694 --> 51:00.695
Istanbul.

51:05.299 --> 51:06.668
What about Elena Houghlin?

51:06.801 --> 51:08.870
I think you know what to do.

51:26.386 --> 51:27.655
<i>I took it apart.</i>

51:27.789 --> 51:31.091
Nothing. No tracker.

51:32.292 --> 51:34.394
It's not emitting
any signals.

51:34.529 --> 51:35.597
What had you worried?

51:37.230 --> 51:38.900
To be honest, I don't know.

51:39.033 --> 51:40.400
A feeling.

51:40.535 --> 51:42.369
Something in the bones.
Hmph.

51:42.503 --> 51:44.271
Old habits.

51:44.404 --> 51:46.908
Perhaps it's simply
that you miss the job.

51:47.041 --> 51:48.977
We all get old, my friend.

51:49.109 --> 51:51.445
Retirement is not
a death sentence.

51:51.579 --> 51:54.314
Says the man
who refuses to retire.

51:56.951 --> 51:58.418
Mm, come on.

52:06.527 --> 52:08.763
What?

52:14.267 --> 52:16.303
Something in the bones,
indeed.

52:16.436 --> 52:18.039
Who would do this to you?

52:25.445 --> 52:28.348
Someone who knows
I'm on to her.

52:30.818 --> 52:32.020
Thank you.

52:47.401 --> 52:49.637
Look at this.

52:50.972 --> 52:54.108
This is the closet
of my dreams.

52:54.241 --> 52:56.644
And I just get
to take whatever I want?

52:56.778 --> 52:59.147
- Borrow.
- Oh.

52:59.279 --> 53:01.015
Is that an actual rule?

53:01.149 --> 53:05.820
Okay. So you wanna start
with a protective base layer.

53:05.953 --> 53:09.524
I recommend
a beaded camisole. Yeah?

53:09.657 --> 53:12.225
Oh. Some kind
of polymer material.

53:12.359 --> 53:14.929
Uh, bulletproof,
composite body armor.

53:15.063 --> 53:18.231
It was originally developed as a
protective layer for spacecraft.

53:18.365 --> 53:21.769
Yeah. And it's a bra
that doesn't dig. Progress.

53:21.903 --> 53:24.404
How we doing down here?

53:24.539 --> 53:26.373
Ah, we're still
in the first closet.

53:28.810 --> 53:30.277
There's another closet?

53:30.410 --> 53:32.345
Hm. Armory open.

53:36.216 --> 53:37.719
Jane, I wanna show
you something.

53:42.389 --> 53:45.258
- Whoa.
- Come on, check it out.

53:46.661 --> 53:48.361
- Here, try these on.
- Oh, thank you.

53:48.495 --> 53:50.598
Why? What do they do? Whoa!

53:50.732 --> 53:53.000
What do they do? Whoa.

53:55.503 --> 53:57.772
Huh. You're younger
than I thought.

53:57.905 --> 53:59.107
I've lived hard.

53:59.239 --> 54:01.109
Think you can put
that MIT degree to use

54:01.241 --> 54:03.010
- with something like this?
- What is it?

54:03.144 --> 54:05.747
Universal Interface. Lets you
hack into almost anything.

54:05.880 --> 54:08.850
Mm-mm, not almost anything.
Everything.

54:08.983 --> 54:11.284
- So here's the new baby.
- What's that?

54:11.418 --> 54:16.256
High-velocity rifle, customized
to fire tranquilizer darts.

54:16.389 --> 54:18.659
The load: nonlethal,
fast-acting, very potent.

54:18.793 --> 54:20.393
Jane, you have
a new cuddle buddy.

54:21.629 --> 54:22.897
Oh, Jesus.

54:23.030 --> 54:24.832
Shall we fit Elena
with comms?

54:24.966 --> 54:26.234
I think so.

54:26.366 --> 54:28.301
Oh, that in-ear radio thing
you guys have?

54:28.435 --> 54:29.804
Ah, even better.

54:29.937 --> 54:31.572
It's a subdermal transmitter.

54:31.706 --> 54:33.908
Works through
bone conduction. See?

54:34.041 --> 54:35.643
So I'm getting a tattoo?

54:37.310 --> 54:39.981
Uh, no. Tattoos are earned
by Angels over time.

54:40.114 --> 54:41.749
You'll get
a less permanent version.

54:41.883 --> 54:44.952
Yeah, comms are concealed
in the link.

54:45.086 --> 54:47.121
As long as you have it on,
you can hear us.

54:47.255 --> 54:50.124
Cool. Hey, can I take
these mints?

54:50.258 --> 54:52.425
No. Avoid the mints.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.996
Actually, let's just stop
the touching around here.

54:55.129 --> 54:57.430
- You know, some of this blows up.
- Oh.

55:12.479 --> 55:14.182
This place is amazing.

55:14.314 --> 55:17.051
It's the crossroads of the world.
Danger and money.

55:17.185 --> 55:20.188
We need to figure out where
Mr. Fleming's meeting his buyer

55:20.320 --> 55:22.056
and get Calisto back
before it becomes

55:22.190 --> 55:24.457
every bad guy's
favorite new weapon.

55:24.592 --> 55:27.494
- Like suitcase nukes.
- Pet tigers.

55:27.628 --> 55:29.697
- Jet Skis.
- Sea-Doos.

55:29.831 --> 55:32.533
Cars that go fast
really furiously.

55:32.667 --> 55:33.968
So how do we find him?

55:34.101 --> 55:37.171
Well, we're off
the agency's grid here, so...

55:37.305 --> 55:41.642
How do we find him? We hit
the streets. We go old-school.

55:41.776 --> 55:44.411
We sling some bills.
We get violent.

55:44.545 --> 55:46.547
I feel like a tiger today,
maybe a leopard.

55:46.681 --> 55:48.950
But either way,
I am down to get wild.

55:49.083 --> 55:50.350
I might have
a contact here.

55:50.483 --> 55:52.153
An asset
from when I was with MI6.

55:52.286 --> 55:53.521
Uh, "might" as in?

55:53.654 --> 55:55.156
As in she definitely
lives here,

55:55.289 --> 55:56.991
and she definitely hates me.

56:07.602 --> 56:09.170
Practice your English?

56:09.303 --> 56:11.172
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Well done.

56:11.305 --> 56:13.574
- Candy!
- Candy.

56:15.776 --> 56:17.645
Still spoiling
the local kids?

56:18.980 --> 56:21.549
You. Get away from me.

56:21.682 --> 56:24.919
Fatima, wait.
Please, just talk to me.

56:25.052 --> 56:27.788
Talk to someone else. I can't
get involved with you again.

56:27.922 --> 56:29.223
Fatima, please wait.

56:29.357 --> 56:31.424
I waited for you already.

56:31.559 --> 56:33.393
Remember?

56:33.527 --> 56:37.131
And I wasn't there for you, but
I don't work for MI6 anymore.

56:37.265 --> 56:39.867
- I work for these people now.
- I don't care.

56:40.001 --> 56:41.434
I don't help you.

56:41.569 --> 56:43.771
You know why.

56:43.905 --> 56:47.108
They are very well-funded.
Non-governmental, NGO.

56:47.241 --> 56:50.278
They can get whatever you need
to get up and running today.

56:50.410 --> 56:53.080
No waiting.
No broken promises.

57:00.321 --> 57:01.589
Thank you.

57:01.722 --> 57:03.624
It's only tea.

57:05.393 --> 57:07.228
What do you want from me?

57:15.269 --> 57:17.071
Have you seen this man?

57:20.341 --> 57:21.642
Maybe...

57:22.710 --> 57:24.477
you know someone who has.

57:26.647 --> 57:28.983
Please. I can help you.

57:29.116 --> 57:30.851
Rebuild the clinic.

57:30.985 --> 57:34.155
- You can help me now?
- I'm sorry.

57:34.288 --> 57:37.158
I believed them when they
told me my asset was safe.

57:37.291 --> 57:39.860
And I believed you,
but I lost everything.

57:39.994 --> 57:44.031
I had to turn away unwed mothers
I could no longer help.

57:44.165 --> 57:45.465
I know.

57:47.568 --> 57:49.770
It's why I quit.

57:52.506 --> 57:54.909
But let me rebuild our trust.

57:58.079 --> 57:59.513
I brought you the usual.

58:02.550 --> 58:04.118
It's right outside.

58:09.924 --> 58:11.025
Show me.

58:14.261 --> 58:16.764
I can get you another shipment
in six months.

58:16.897 --> 58:17.999
Four.

58:21.802 --> 58:24.839
So how long will it take
for your sources to find our guy?

58:24.972 --> 58:26.574
Because we really need to...

58:30.111 --> 58:32.146
Is this what
the doctor ordered?

58:32.279 --> 58:35.182
Okay. Let's get this
off the street.

58:35.316 --> 58:36.317
All right.

58:39.620 --> 58:40.654
Good job, Jane.

58:46.227 --> 58:50.064
Your man is in a hotel.
The Pasha Hotel.

58:50.197 --> 58:52.366
The Ibrahim Pasha?

58:52.501 --> 58:55.002
Do you know anybody
who can get us into his room?

58:55.136 --> 58:56.337
Of course.

58:56.470 --> 58:58.507
I will take the van too.

59:06.047 --> 59:07.548
Of course.

59:11.352 --> 59:13.020
Pasha. Let's go.

59:25.199 --> 59:29.236
<i>Let's learn all we can about
Mr. Fleming's trip to Istanbul.</i>

59:29.370 --> 59:32.740
<i>When Fleming goes out,
we go in.</i>

59:35.743 --> 59:38.646
<i>Double his devices.
Gather all his communications.</i>

59:38.779 --> 59:42.049
<i>The when, the where, the who.</i>

59:42.183 --> 59:45.386
He's been looking at property
in Costa Rica.

59:45.520 --> 59:48.722
And he's got
an offshore bank account.

59:48.856 --> 59:50.825
Gotcha.

59:58.599 --> 01:00:00.701
<i>What about me?
What should I do?</i>

01:00:00.835 --> 01:00:03.904
<i>Seeing as you're supposed to be
dead, why don't you relax.</i>

01:00:04.038 --> 01:00:06.407
<i>Fleming could recognize you,
and we can't risk it.</i>

01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:12.880
No, thank you. Full.

01:00:27.228 --> 01:00:28.829
<i>Let's get in there.</i>

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:43.677
<i>Jane, he's almost there.</i>

01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:45.646
<i>Sabina, text him now.</i>

01:00:58.759 --> 01:01:00.361
Sir, is everything all right?

01:01:00.494 --> 01:01:01.996
No, I can't find my hat.

01:01:02.129 --> 01:01:03.598
Let me help you with that.

01:01:03.731 --> 01:01:05.534
- Your hat.
- Thank you. Yes. Thank you.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.468
Have you seen my phone?

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.172
- Your bag.
- Oh, thanks.

01:01:12.574 --> 01:01:14.341
- Oh, there it is.
- Thank you.

01:01:18.445 --> 01:01:21.148
<i>Alrighty, here it is.
We filtered his communications,</i>

01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:23.552
and it seems Mr. Fleming
is selling Calisto

01:01:23.684 --> 01:01:25.620
tomorrow
at the Turkish derby.

01:01:25.753 --> 01:01:28.055
Veliefendi Hippodrome.

01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:29.823
<i>Of course,
this particular racetrack</i>

01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:32.359
<i>is popular with a syndicate
of wealthy businessmen.</i>

01:01:32.493 --> 01:01:33.928
<i>No doubt with connections</i>

01:01:34.061 --> 01:01:35.930
<i>to international arms deals,
drug trade and...</i>

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:38.432
<i>All parties who might
be interested in Calisto.</i>

01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:40.234
<i>Familiarize yourselves:
syndicate members,</i>

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:41.936
<i>wealthy horse owners
expected to attend.</i>

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:44.205
<i>Flag anyone Fleming
could be in business with.</i>

01:01:44.338 --> 01:01:45.540
I wanna help.

01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:49.710
Look, I am not
just some frightened girl

01:01:49.843 --> 01:01:51.946
in your witness
protection program.

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:55.182
If you need help getting in and
out of someplace, I can do it.

01:01:55.316 --> 01:01:58.719
I can hack any system,
and I can do it fast.

01:01:58.852 --> 01:02:00.622
You need me, Mrs. Bosley.

01:02:00.754 --> 01:02:03.658
And don't tell me I can't do it
because I know I can.

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.993
I am... I'm done
sitting still. I'm...

01:02:06.126 --> 01:02:08.829
I've had a taste.
I want more.

01:02:10.464 --> 01:02:11.566
I want in.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.504
You know, I once saw
a really fat baby

01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:19.440
giving Eskimo kisses
to a kitten.

01:02:20.841 --> 01:02:23.410
And that was more adorable.

01:02:23.545 --> 01:02:25.446
Also, it's implied
that you're coming

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.214
because you're in
this briefing.

01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:29.584
Yeah, she gave you
the universal hacking tool

01:02:29.718 --> 01:02:32.019
and the bracelet,
right?

01:02:32.152 --> 01:02:33.921
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:38.259
But how'd that feel? It looked
like it felt really good.

01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:40.494
- Felt nice.
- I was just gonna give you

01:02:40.629 --> 01:02:43.632
- the tablet once I was done.
- Mm.

01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:49.136
- Uh, carry on.
- Great.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:51.105
As I was about to say,

01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:52.741
<i>there's a lot of ground
to cover,</i>

01:02:52.873 --> 01:02:54.775
<i>so we're gonna need
to spread out.</i>

01:02:54.908 --> 01:02:57.512
<i>Elena, you'll be
our eye in the sky.</i>

01:02:57.646 --> 01:03:01.348
<i>The track's mainframe's located
just inside the press box.</i>

01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:04.586
<i>We'll get you in. You hack
into the security cameras.</i>

01:03:04.719 --> 01:03:06.153
<i>Watch for Mr. Fleming.</i>

01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:11.825
<i>Jane's on crowd control.</i>

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.228
<i>Turkish derby attracts
thousands of spectators</i>

01:03:14.361 --> 01:03:16.631
<i>who need to be scanned
and assessed.</i>

01:03:20.067 --> 01:03:21.435
<i>Start low, go high.</i>

01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:22.803
<i>From your nest,</i>

01:03:22.936 --> 01:03:24.438
<i>you can provide
tactical support.</i>

01:03:24.572 --> 01:03:28.075
<i>Take out any threats
to the operation.</i>

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:30.512
<i>Sabina, you'll run
the ground game.</i>

01:03:30.645 --> 01:03:32.846
<i>Once the target's on site,
you make the grab.</i>

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:35.784
<i>We need Fleming,
his buyer and Calisto.</i>

01:03:35.916 --> 01:03:37.184
<i>No loose ends.</i>

01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:42.022
<i>I'll take care
of the transportation</i>

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:43.725
<i>and prep for extraction.</i>

01:03:43.857 --> 01:03:45.893
<i>We're taking everybody
out of there with us.</i>

01:03:46.026 --> 01:03:48.395
<i>I have just the vehicle
to do it.</i>

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:51.666
Okay, and I'm in.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.004
Hey, Jane.

01:03:57.137 --> 01:03:59.373
Ah, there you are.

01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:04.878
Comm check. Sabina.

01:04:05.012 --> 01:04:05.979
Good.

01:04:06.113 --> 01:04:07.515
- <i>Jane.</i>
- Good.

01:04:07.649 --> 01:04:10.117
- Elena.
- <i>Good.</i>

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.653
Don't talk into your bracelet.

01:04:13.755 --> 01:04:15.989
I just missed a superfecta.

01:04:16.123 --> 01:04:18.793
Better luck in the third run,
I hope.

01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:22.196
Hey, what's your bet?

01:04:23.698 --> 01:04:24.965
Um...

01:04:27.434 --> 01:04:28.837
The blue one.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.138
Mm.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:36.910
Six minutes to post time.
Anybody see anything?

01:04:38.379 --> 01:04:39.614
Nothing yet.

01:04:43.852 --> 01:04:45.886
<i>Jane, you got anything yet?</i>

01:04:46.019 --> 01:04:47.221
Nothing.

01:04:55.329 --> 01:04:58.031
Excuse me, who is that?

01:04:58.165 --> 01:04:59.701
Alim Hassan.

01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:00.934
Qatari prince.

01:05:01.068 --> 01:05:03.638
- Oh, "Qatari prince."
- Yeah, serious money.

01:05:03.772 --> 01:05:05.874
- "Serious money."
- Owns hundreds of horses.

01:05:06.006 --> 01:05:08.375
- "Owns hundreds of horses"?
- Yeah.

01:05:09.811 --> 01:05:10.911
<i>We get it. He's rich.</i>

01:05:11.044 --> 01:05:12.614
Is he the buyer?

01:05:12.747 --> 01:05:14.516
<i>I don't have an angle.</i>

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:17.217
Sabina! Fleming.

01:05:17.351 --> 01:05:19.920
<i>That's him. Light blue suit!</i>

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.761
Yeah, he's here.

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:29.363
That's definitely him. Sabina?

01:05:29.496 --> 01:05:30.632
Got him.

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:33.768
He has the goods.

01:05:33.902 --> 01:05:35.537
Moving in.

01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:39.139
Jane?

01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:44.813
In my sights. Boz?

01:05:44.945 --> 01:05:46.146
The ride is ready.

01:05:50.718 --> 01:05:52.787
He's talking to somebody.
Gray suit.

01:05:52.921 --> 01:05:54.288
Is that the buyer?

01:05:58.158 --> 01:06:01.295
- It's the assassin.
- Bae showed up.

01:06:01.428 --> 01:06:03.130
If you think you're
killing him before I kill him

01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:04.131
I'll kill you first.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:05.867
Take the shot, Jane. Bag him.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:10.971
In the car? All right.

01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:18.145
- Oh, shit.
- They're in the Mercedes.

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:20.849
- There's no sale here.
- We gotta go! Get down here.

01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:22.149
I'm coming!

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:24.786
Shit, shit!

01:06:24.919 --> 01:06:26.186
Shit!

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:30.758
<i>Get a tracker on that Mercedes!</i>

01:06:30.892 --> 01:06:32.125
On it!

01:06:45.105 --> 01:06:46.406
Come on! Hyah!

01:06:52.379 --> 01:06:54.214
Come on.

01:06:54.348 --> 01:06:55.517
Coming in!

01:06:58.118 --> 01:06:59.587
Come on. Move, move, move.

01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:01.689
- <i>Come on, Elena!</i>
- I'm coming!

01:07:13.868 --> 01:07:15.168
Go, go, go!

01:07:17.605 --> 01:07:18.840
Come on!

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:47.635
- Giddyup.
- Sabina!

01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:49.102
- Hey, guys.
- Get in here.

01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:52.439
Okay, punch it.

01:07:52.574 --> 01:07:54.408
- Here we go! Great job!
- Whoo!

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:58.478
How did you...? I didn't know
you could jump horses.

01:07:58.613 --> 01:08:01.481
- More money, more horses.
- Huh.

01:08:01.616 --> 01:08:03.918
Can somebody
please track this mofo?

01:08:05.053 --> 01:08:06.621
We cannot tail him in this.

01:08:08.422 --> 01:08:09.724
Hold on.

01:08:21.868 --> 01:08:23.571
They're headed north
out of town.

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.310
We've left city limits.

01:08:30.444 --> 01:08:32.947
There's nothing out here
but a rock quarry.

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:36.416
Bring up the specs.

01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.805
I'll circle until you signal.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.207
The sale will definitely
go down here.

01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:03.810
Let's take everything.
We don't know who's in there.

01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:06.145
I-I think
I'm a little overdressed.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:11.118
Okay, um...

01:09:11.251 --> 01:09:12.687
You need this.

01:09:28.167 --> 01:09:29.504
I see a way in.

01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:32.140
Ja... Jane! Jane!

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:39.046
Come on.

01:10:00.134 --> 01:10:01.268
Huh?

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.874
In your dreams.

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:13.614
Hi.

01:10:18.019 --> 01:10:20.722
Hey, he's gonna wake up.
Come on.

01:10:26.194 --> 01:10:27.662
You've got all the dots.

01:10:27.795 --> 01:10:29.564
I signaled you,
you went rogue.

01:10:29.697 --> 01:10:31.833
- Should we toss him?
- Yeah, let's do it.

01:10:37.705 --> 01:10:40.340
Man. Whoever Fleming's
in business with,

01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:42.375
he is in
way over his head.

01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:45.378
Seal that gate.
Lock them in.

01:10:45.513 --> 01:10:47.849
- Then lock yourself in here.
- Okay.

01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:50.017
These are for you.

01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:53.121
They are not mints.

01:10:53.253 --> 01:10:55.623
- You got it?
- Not mints.

01:10:55.757 --> 01:10:57.457
- Let's go.
- Lock this. Not mints.

01:10:57.592 --> 01:10:58.960
- No, I know.
- Lock it!

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:17.145
Okay, the gate is locked. Only
other exit is up three stories.

01:11:17.277 --> 01:11:18.613
Nicely done, Elena.

01:11:38.766 --> 01:11:40.467
There he is.

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:42.970
- Mr. Fleming.
- Yes.

01:11:43.104 --> 01:11:44.605
That's Australian Jonny.

01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:46.607
Didn't we hand him
over to the Americans?

01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:47.742
Well, he's here.

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.510
If you think
you're gonna kill me

01:11:49.644 --> 01:11:50.945
before I kill him...

01:11:52.312 --> 01:11:53.614
What was the thing
you said?

01:11:53.748 --> 01:11:56.684
So, uh, you are...?

01:11:56.818 --> 01:11:59.452
I represent a buyer
who wishes to remain anonymous.

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:00.888
Ah.

01:12:01.022 --> 01:12:03.558
- Let's have a look.
- Of course.

01:12:05.293 --> 01:12:06.694
<i>Guys, that's Calisto.</i>

01:12:06.828 --> 01:12:08.663
There we go.

01:12:11.098 --> 01:12:12.900
The money?

01:12:13.034 --> 01:12:13.968
COD.

01:12:15.435 --> 01:12:17.038
Plus wire transfer.

01:12:19.273 --> 01:12:20.340
Great.

01:12:20.473 --> 01:12:22.210
But before we close the deal,

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.512
my employer would like
a little demonstration

01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:29.016
just to make sure
the devices do what you say.

01:12:33.353 --> 01:12:35.690
You want me
to kill somebody?

01:12:35.823 --> 01:12:37.191
Damn.

01:12:37.325 --> 01:12:40.360
No, I don't,
but my employer insists.

01:12:40.493 --> 01:12:43.197
<i>So, yes. Pick anybody.</i>

01:12:43.331 --> 01:12:45.967
- Obviously, don't pick me.
- Uh...

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.671
- Sidam, go get somebody.
- Uh, no, no, no.

01:12:50.805 --> 01:12:54.474
Uh, I-I-I gave you
the report.

01:12:54.609 --> 01:12:59.080
It's all outlined in there, so
that was never part of the deal.

01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:02.415
<i>Well, Mr. Fleming,
it is now.</i>

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:06.187
<i>Look, it's a complicated process.
Obviously, I don't...</i>

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.189
You don't even know
how it works, do you?

01:13:08.322 --> 01:13:09.924
<i>It'll require root access</i>

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.792
or a world-class hacker.

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:15.363
Whoa, whoa!

01:13:15.495 --> 01:13:17.531
What are you thinking?
Bloody hell!

01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:20.201
That was not part of the plan,
Mr. Hodak!

01:13:21.269 --> 01:13:22.236
Damn it!

01:13:23.504 --> 01:13:24.739
Boz, Fleming is down.

01:13:24.872 --> 01:13:28.242
<i>The assassin works
for Jonny Smith.</i>

01:13:28.376 --> 01:13:29.911
<i>Boz.</i>

01:13:30.044 --> 01:13:31.746
We need to engage.
Ready for exfil?

01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:34.782
Let's get out of here! Someone
grab that. Get me out of here.

01:13:36.851 --> 01:13:38.686
Boz, they are leaving.

01:13:38.819 --> 01:13:39.954
<i>Go, no-go?</i>

01:13:41.355 --> 01:13:43.224
Where the hell is she?

01:13:43.357 --> 01:13:44.792
I can't see her anywhere.

01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:49.530
It won't open.

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:51.065
Well, then fix it.

01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:52.934
Go upstairs and fix it.

01:13:57.371 --> 01:13:59.140
Oh, no.
Guys, someone's coming.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.809
<i>He's headed your way.</i>

01:14:22.563 --> 01:14:23.463
Together.

01:14:39.246 --> 01:14:40.781
- Up there!
- Shit.

01:14:42.416 --> 01:14:44.285
- Find them!
- Oh, my God. Guys?

01:14:44.418 --> 01:14:45.686
- Go!
- <i>What's happening?</i>

01:14:47.288 --> 01:14:49.489
I'll take the assassin.
Cover me.

01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:51.692
Go. Go, go, go!

01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:08.009
Oh, Miss Independent.

01:15:15.716 --> 01:15:17.385
Um... Uh, just a minute!

01:15:17.518 --> 01:15:19.487
Um, <i>ocupado.</i>

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.655
Whoa! Oh...

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:25.693
- Who are you?
- Gah! Oh!

01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:29.663
Stay away.
I know Krav Maga.

01:15:29.797 --> 01:15:31.999
Where you learn?
Shopping mall?

01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:35.903
One! Two! Three!

01:15:36.037 --> 01:15:37.638
Krav Maga! Yeah.

01:15:42.977 --> 01:15:44.311
Don't shoot.

01:15:44.445 --> 01:15:46.480
Jonny Australia,
the pleasure is all yours.

01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:51.318
Come on.

01:15:53.454 --> 01:15:55.189
Jane, where's
that sleepy-neck button?

01:15:55.322 --> 01:15:57.091
<i>I'm a little busy.
Figure it out!</i>

01:16:02.129 --> 01:16:03.564
Ooh!

01:16:03.697 --> 01:16:05.266
Elena? Help me!

01:16:09.236 --> 01:16:10.571
Ah!

01:16:21.215 --> 01:16:22.416
Thanks, Elena.

01:16:22.551 --> 01:16:24.251
I have dreamed of this moment

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:26.887
since the day I met you.
Except your hair was longer.

01:16:27.021 --> 01:16:28.722
But I like this too.
This is great.

01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:37.598
- Hey. Don't even think about it.
- You want to run away with me?

01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:39.867
Oh, you're so desperate.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.136
Hey, stop right... Elena!

01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:43.572
I want to live
to see you again!

01:16:43.704 --> 01:16:45.039
<i>Close the gate!</i>

01:16:51.912 --> 01:16:52.813
Too late!

01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:03.257
<i>Jane, where are you?!</i>

01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:05.226
<i>The assassin's getting away!</i>

01:17:20.641 --> 01:17:21.976
<i>Sabina!</i>

01:17:24.979 --> 01:17:26.180
Uh...

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:27.381
Who are you?

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:32.153
Elena, stop this thing!

01:17:32.286 --> 01:17:33.354
No!

01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:37.191
Give me the case!

01:17:43.297 --> 01:17:44.198
Oh!

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.034
<i>Elena?</i>

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:50.505
- Hold on!
- <i>Elena!</i>

01:17:52.973 --> 01:17:53.974
Elena!

01:17:57.945 --> 01:17:59.413
Oh, God. Oh, no!

01:18:02.483 --> 01:18:05.554
Come on. Elena?
I need you, man! I need you!

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:10.625
Sabina, stay to the side!

01:18:10.758 --> 01:18:11.959
Awesome!

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:17.965
Get me out of here!

01:18:19.099 --> 01:18:20.234
Stop it!

01:18:25.773 --> 01:18:27.141
Elena!

01:18:29.343 --> 01:18:32.213
<i>It's about to get
very crush-y in here!</i>

01:18:34.683 --> 01:18:36.317
Jane, we need you!

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:37.552
I've nearly got it!

01:18:37.686 --> 01:18:39.688
<i>Jane, hurry!</i>

01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:40.888
<i>Jane!</i>

01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:50.364
I'm on my way.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.001
Sabina,

01:18:54.134 --> 01:18:55.269
<i>reach up.</i>

01:19:02.544 --> 01:19:04.845
Jane! Jane!

01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:06.914
This one! This one! There!

01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:15.222
Oh, thank God.

01:19:22.796 --> 01:19:23.797
Oh, God.

01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:25.432
You all right, Sabina?!

01:19:25.567 --> 01:19:27.301
Yeah. Better late than never.

01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:37.111
Ha!

01:19:37.244 --> 01:19:38.912
Oh, it's the wrong side.

01:19:44.753 --> 01:19:46.954
Hey,
did the rookie just tranq herself?

01:19:47.087 --> 01:19:48.355
Yup.

01:19:50.057 --> 01:19:51.693
Where's your boyfriend?

01:19:51.825 --> 01:19:55.095
- Hodak. The assassin?
- Gone.

01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:56.964
Took Calisto with him.

01:19:57.097 --> 01:19:59.534
- Where's Jonny?
- He scurried off.

01:19:59.668 --> 01:20:01.770
He's a little bitch.

01:20:01.902 --> 01:20:03.370
Where's Boz?

01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:09.611
We probably
shouldn't be caught

01:20:09.744 --> 01:20:11.145
standing over
a dead body.

01:20:11.278 --> 01:20:13.748
Not dressed like this, no.

01:20:38.305 --> 01:20:39.641
Is she dead?

01:20:41.776 --> 01:20:43.511
You want to touch her?

01:20:44.845 --> 01:20:46.480
Come on.

01:20:46.614 --> 01:20:47.549
Touch her.

01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:52.453
She feels alive!

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.955
You woke her up.

01:20:56.857 --> 01:20:58.827
Hey, you.

01:20:58.959 --> 01:21:00.461
Are we on a boat?

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:02.797
Yeah.

01:21:25.553 --> 01:21:27.020
- Bosley!
- Boz?

01:21:27.154 --> 01:21:28.889
Mrs. Bosley?

01:21:34.696 --> 01:21:35.730
Boz.

01:21:36.831 --> 01:21:38.365
Do Bosleys usually leave?

01:21:39.834 --> 01:21:41.368
No, this is all wrong.

01:21:42.771 --> 01:21:45.607
- So she's gone?
- Well, we were made,

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.307
so maybe she wanted
to do a sweep.

01:21:49.109 --> 01:21:50.244
Maybe.

01:21:52.346 --> 01:21:53.648
Or she's...

01:21:55.583 --> 01:21:58.753
What? No.
Boz was the first Angel

01:21:58.887 --> 01:22:00.954
to be promoted to Bosley.
She's one of us.

01:22:01.088 --> 01:22:03.323
She would not be
the first Angel to turn.

01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:05.225
It's happened.
You know the history.

01:22:05.359 --> 01:22:07.629
It was her idea to steal Calisto
from the lab.

01:22:07.762 --> 01:22:10.063
Exactly.
But Fleming beat her to it.

01:22:10.197 --> 01:22:13.100
It's been our mission the entire
time to get this thing back,

01:22:13.233 --> 01:22:15.469
and it just keeps
slipping us, like...

01:22:15.603 --> 01:22:19.072
We're better than that.
It's... It's her.

01:22:19.206 --> 01:22:21.375
Fleming's dead.
Calisto's gone.

01:22:22.443 --> 01:22:23.977
And so is she.

01:22:25.412 --> 01:22:27.749
Jonny said
he represented somebody...

01:22:27.882 --> 01:22:29.249
What if it's Boz?

01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:35.456
That's my room.

01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:43.063
Hello?

01:22:43.197 --> 01:22:45.834
Charlie sends love.
You're in grave danger.

01:22:45.966 --> 01:22:48.135
- <i>Get out of there now!</i>
- Guys?

01:23:07.622 --> 01:23:09.189
Jane?

01:23:22.871 --> 01:23:25.005
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:26.574
Elena, stay down! Stay down!

01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.150
I'm Bosley.

01:23:37.284 --> 01:23:39.521
Let's get you out of here.

01:23:39.654 --> 01:23:41.188
Quickly.

01:24:19.192 --> 01:24:20.260
Sabina?

01:24:23.397 --> 01:24:25.365
Sabina.

01:24:25.499 --> 01:24:26.901
Sabina.

01:24:37.011 --> 01:24:38.746
Hey. Sabina.

01:24:57.065 --> 01:24:58.700
She means
a lot to you.

01:24:59.934 --> 01:25:01.970
We're new friends.

01:25:02.102 --> 01:25:03.370
I think.

01:25:05.607 --> 01:25:08.442
It's been a really
tough week.

01:25:14.214 --> 01:25:16.149
I can't lose her too.

01:25:29.597 --> 01:25:31.099
What are you doing?

01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:33.200
Oh! Oh, God.

01:25:33.333 --> 01:25:35.703
- Ow!
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:25:35.837 --> 01:25:36.771
I'm so sorry.

01:25:38.973 --> 01:25:40.775
Why are you crying?

01:25:40.908 --> 01:25:43.511
Oh, I'm not crying. Heh.

01:25:44.912 --> 01:25:46.446
Well, you are. That's...

01:25:46.581 --> 01:25:47.782
That's what's...

01:25:49.984 --> 01:25:52.053
Okay, fine, yeah,
I'm crying.

01:25:53.755 --> 01:25:56.691
But I didn't think
that you...

01:25:56.824 --> 01:25:58.026
cared about me.

01:25:58.158 --> 01:25:59.961
Why?

01:26:00.094 --> 01:26:01.495
Because...

01:26:01.629 --> 01:26:03.798
Because you don't think
I have any feelings.

01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:05.633
No, I...

01:26:07.367 --> 01:26:10.138
I can be really annoying.

01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:11.973
Most of the time.

01:26:12.106 --> 01:26:14.207
You can be so annoying.

01:26:14.341 --> 01:26:16.010
I don't try to be.
It just sort of...

01:26:16.144 --> 01:26:18.146
I don't have the filter thing
people have.

01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:23.183
- Hey.
- I don't know

01:26:23.316 --> 01:26:26.721
what this is made of,
but it saved your life.

01:26:26.854 --> 01:26:28.990
Thanks.

01:26:29.123 --> 01:26:30.625
Where's Elena?

01:26:30.758 --> 01:26:32.160
I don't know.

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:35.163
We have to find her,
so I called in for some help.

01:26:35.295 --> 01:26:38.365
- Because I got blown up?
- Yeah.

01:26:40.267 --> 01:26:42.503
But also because...

01:26:42.637 --> 01:26:45.907
you convinced me I don't
have to do everything by myself.

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.240
Well done.

01:26:48.943 --> 01:26:52.180
Hello, Angels.
You owe me an explanation.

01:26:52.312 --> 01:26:54.649
This is not Brazil.

01:26:54.782 --> 01:26:57.051
- Hey.
- I brought supplies.

01:26:57.185 --> 01:26:59.020
Homemade kombucha
with probiotics.

01:26:59.153 --> 01:27:00.722
And the best part...

01:27:00.855 --> 01:27:02.389
I brought a friend.

01:27:02.523 --> 01:27:03.524
You.
You trai...

01:27:03.658 --> 01:27:05.225
- Hey!
- Jane.

01:27:05.358 --> 01:27:06.661
I'm not the mole.

01:27:06.794 --> 01:27:07.762
Then why are you here?

01:27:07.895 --> 01:27:09.831
The same reason you are.

01:27:09.964 --> 01:27:11.899
I should be dead.

01:27:16.336 --> 01:27:18.106
She called me
right after you did.

01:27:18.238 --> 01:27:20.340
I have an herbal compress
for the bruises.

01:27:20.474 --> 01:27:23.276
- Nobody wants that.
- Okay. Keep your bruises.

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:24.879
So then who?

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.716
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

01:27:31.119 --> 01:27:32.720
I had some clothes sent up.

01:27:32.854 --> 01:27:34.387
Take your pick.

01:27:37.892 --> 01:27:40.728
Um, why so formal?

01:27:40.862 --> 01:27:43.798
I'm sorry, is this
another headquarters?

01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:47.400
Have you heard from Jane
and Sabina? Will they come?

01:27:47.535 --> 01:27:49.436
So inquisitive.

01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:51.471
Curiosity of a cat.

01:27:51.606 --> 01:27:53.174
Or a ferret.

01:27:53.306 --> 01:27:55.076
It's the scientist in you,
isn't it?

01:27:56.978 --> 01:27:59.279
Just trying
to understand my situation.

01:27:59.412 --> 01:28:03.283
You wanted an audience with
Mr. Brok to discuss Calisto.

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:05.987
Well, soon you'll have one.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.321
But Calisto's
been stolen now, so I...

01:28:22.136 --> 01:28:23.638
Well done.

01:28:25.673 --> 01:28:28.609
Satisfying when a plan
comes together.

01:28:28.743 --> 01:28:31.444
We'll give you some privacy.

01:28:32.613 --> 01:28:33.948
Oh, my...

01:28:37.919 --> 01:28:40.154
- No way.
- Oh, yes.

01:28:40.288 --> 01:28:41.789
I've been tracking him
for weeks.

01:28:41.923 --> 01:28:43.291
<i>When he landed in Istanbul,</i>

01:28:43.423 --> 01:28:44.992
<i>I knew I needed to get to him</i>

01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:46.694
<i>before he got to you.</i>

01:28:46.828 --> 01:28:49.329
<i>Boz, they are leaving.
Go, no-go?</i>

01:28:51.966 --> 01:28:53.301
<i>Boz.</i>

01:28:53.433 --> 01:28:54.669
Damn it!

01:28:54.802 --> 01:28:57.038
I'm sorry I left
the quarry, but...

01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.040
more sorry I was too late.

01:28:59.173 --> 01:29:02.176
I just can't believe that.
A Bosley?

01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:04.979
Mm, you had no trouble
believing it was me.

01:29:05.112 --> 01:29:07.148
- You heard that?
- Mm.

01:29:07.281 --> 01:29:09.283
Australian Jonny.

01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:12.320
- The one that got away.
- Yeah, again.

01:29:12.452 --> 01:29:13.988
The last time we saw him,

01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:16.557
- we were in Rio, and then...
- You pushed me off a roof.

01:29:16.691 --> 01:29:18.726
- You have got to get over that.
- Oh, my God.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:21.428
I am. Just processing.

01:29:21.562 --> 01:29:23.698
So then the last person
to see him was...

01:29:23.831 --> 01:29:25.398
- Was Bosley.
- Exactly.

01:29:25.533 --> 01:29:27.068
When Jonny
didn't make it to jail,

01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:29.036
Charlie suspected
Bosley had gone rogue.

01:29:29.170 --> 01:29:31.305
It turns out
he's building his own network,

01:29:31.438 --> 01:29:33.473
selling his services
to the highest bidders.

01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:35.276
He's using us
to date criminals now?

01:29:35.408 --> 01:29:40.281
Yeah. Jonny, Mr. Hodak, that
assassin, they work for Bosley.

01:29:40.413 --> 01:29:42.783
He always seemed like
kind of a weirdo.

01:29:42.917 --> 01:29:44.752
Freaky. English.

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.922
- So Bosley has Elena.
- Mm-hm.

01:29:48.055 --> 01:29:50.057
- Do we know where?
- Of course we know.

01:29:50.191 --> 01:29:52.860
There's trackers
in most of the clothes.

01:29:52.994 --> 01:29:55.563
You have a lot of leather
jackets at your apartment.

01:29:55.696 --> 01:29:58.699
- See, I told you it was borrow and not take.
- Shh shh...

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:02.303
Brok is hosting a party
at his compound. Elena's there.

01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:07.875
<i>Every year, he brings together
the wealthy and beautiful</i>

01:30:08.009 --> 01:30:10.544
<i>for his annual Vision Party.</i>

01:30:10.678 --> 01:30:13.714
<i>This year, he's planning to
present Calisto to investors.</i>

01:30:13.848 --> 01:30:15.983
Why would Bosley want
to take Elena to Brok?

01:30:16.117 --> 01:30:19.654
Bringing the Birdman
back to Alcatraz, I guess.

01:30:20.788 --> 01:30:21.989
The who?

01:30:23.423 --> 01:30:25.293
It's a movie.
Burt Lancaster.

01:30:25.425 --> 01:30:27.328
<i>Birdman.</i> Michael Keaton.

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:30.430
- No, Michael Keaton is Batman.
- No, Ben Affleck is Batman.

01:30:30.564 --> 01:30:32.400
I mean, is he?

01:30:32.533 --> 01:30:35.269
Am I the only person here
who knows who Burt Lancaster is?

01:30:35.403 --> 01:30:36.804
- I'm concussed.
- Doesn't matter.

01:30:36.938 --> 01:30:39.140
- It's an old movie. It's from...
- How old are you?

01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:41.642
How old am I? What?
That has nothing to do with it.

01:30:41.776 --> 01:30:44.111
- I don't have your references.
- There are film buffs

01:30:44.245 --> 01:30:46.446
- of all ages.
- Let's go get our girl.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:53.988
What do you want with me?

01:31:11.739 --> 01:31:14.008
Did you raid
your mom's closet for this?

01:31:15.543 --> 01:31:17.678
What else of hers
do you play with?

01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:29.991
I've spent an entire career
estimating the talents of women.

01:31:30.124 --> 01:31:33.160
And you, my dear,

01:31:33.294 --> 01:31:35.663
are marvelously clever.

01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:38.132
You betrayed them.

01:31:38.265 --> 01:31:40.034
You betrayed the Angels.

01:31:40.167 --> 01:31:43.037
Well, I no longer work
for the Townsend Agency.

01:31:43.170 --> 01:31:46.073
I was retired.

01:31:46.207 --> 01:31:50.211
So you are going
to show me

01:31:50.344 --> 01:31:53.848
how to hack this
and reprogram root access...

01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.417
to me.

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:58.719
You thought Fleming
could do it.

01:31:58.853 --> 01:32:00.755
He always had a habit
of claiming credit

01:32:00.888 --> 01:32:02.423
he didn't deserve.

01:32:02.556 --> 01:32:05.059
- How long will it take?
- Forever. I'm not touching it.

01:32:07.361 --> 01:32:09.897
Ha, ha, you think
you have a choice.

01:32:10.031 --> 01:32:11.565
It's adorable.

01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:14.168
They'll send...
They'll send love.

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:19.907
They'll send love.

01:32:21.342 --> 01:32:24.545
Ooh, feisty.
You've been studying.

01:32:27.516 --> 01:32:30.017
I hope they come.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:48.736
<i>The compound has
nearly 60 rooms on four levels.</i>

01:32:48.869 --> 01:32:51.705
<i>There's 36 security guards
contracted for the party,</i>

01:32:51.839 --> 01:32:53.340
<i>plus Brok's private crew.</i>

01:33:06.387 --> 01:33:07.788
That's my song!

01:33:40.387 --> 01:33:42.056
Oh, did you want one?

01:33:43.824 --> 01:33:46.827
- I'm good.
- Okay, let's do this.

01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:49.830
<i>Elena's being held on the top
floor, northwest corner.</i>

01:33:49.964 --> 01:33:51.832
<i>She's our priority.</i>

01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:23.565
- Oop! Hey.
- This is a private floor.

01:34:23.697 --> 01:34:25.833
I'm just turned around.
This place is huge.

01:34:25.966 --> 01:34:27.502
I was looking for
the bathroom.

01:34:27.636 --> 01:34:29.638
It's just that
I really need to pee.

01:34:29.770 --> 01:34:32.239
Am I in the wrong place?
I thought may...

01:34:35.142 --> 01:34:36.343
Sweet dreams.

01:34:38.445 --> 01:34:39.680
We're in.

01:34:40.714 --> 01:34:42.149
Why are you doing this?

01:34:42.283 --> 01:34:45.886
To neutralize an enemy
discreetly and anonymously.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:48.322
That's a gold standard
in my business.

01:34:48.455 --> 01:34:51.325
What you deem a flaw,
I deem a gift.

01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:55.564
One that not only
provides power...

01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:57.364
but confers it as well.

01:35:00.134 --> 01:35:01.969
Whoa, what are you doing
in my office?

01:35:02.102 --> 01:35:04.539
Mr. Brok? Oh, my God.
Thank God. Please help me.

01:35:04.673 --> 01:35:06.307
- What is she doing here?
- These men...

01:35:10.277 --> 01:35:13.480
John, I'm a little confused.
I thought you handled her.

01:35:13.615 --> 01:35:15.482
Handled me?

01:35:18.452 --> 01:35:19.554
It was you?

01:35:19.688 --> 01:35:21.889
You wanted to sabotage me.

01:35:22.022 --> 01:35:24.158
What were you expecting,
flowers?

01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:25.926
A handwritten thank-you note?

01:35:27.529 --> 01:35:29.930
Get rid of her already.

01:35:30.064 --> 01:35:33.434
Actually, I believe
that she can still prove useful.

01:35:33.568 --> 01:35:39.273
- Do you even know who he is?
- Yes. My global security chief.

01:35:39.406 --> 01:35:42.343
John's just recovered Calisto
from Peter Fleming,

01:35:42.476 --> 01:35:44.278
that shortsighted,
greedy traitor.

01:35:44.411 --> 01:35:46.747
They killed him.
They killed Fleming.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:48.550
Whoa, whoa,
la-la-la-la-la!

01:35:48.683 --> 01:35:50.384
This is the problem
with you, right?

01:35:50.518 --> 01:35:53.287
You keep telling me shit
I can't know.

01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.390
Plausible deniability.
You ever heard of it?

01:35:56.524 --> 01:35:57.791
You're a terrible employee.

01:35:57.925 --> 01:35:59.793
Yeah, and who cares
if people die, right?

01:35:59.927 --> 01:36:01.495
As long as the investors
are happy.

01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:02.830
Grow up, little girl.

01:36:02.963 --> 01:36:05.232
Calisto is about
to change the world.

01:36:05.366 --> 01:36:09.003
If you want to bake a cake,
you got to break a few eggs.

01:36:09.136 --> 01:36:11.839
It's omelet. If you're gonna
compare dead people to eggs,

01:36:11.972 --> 01:36:14.174
could you at least use
the correct phrase?

01:36:14.308 --> 01:36:17.646
I shouldn't be here, ha, ha.
You're a security threat.

01:36:17.778 --> 01:36:20.180
You take care of her
and finish what you started.

01:36:20.314 --> 01:36:21.815
That's exactly the plan.

01:36:24.885 --> 01:36:26.688
Oh, excuse me.
I have a party to host.

01:36:28.155 --> 01:36:32.426
- Yo, Tats, move.
- Take a seat, Mr. Brok.

01:36:34.094 --> 01:36:35.664
Uh, no.

01:36:35.829 --> 01:36:38.499
Sorry, what
the hell's happening here?

01:36:38.633 --> 01:36:39.967
Oh, my God.

01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:42.671
Let me out now.

01:36:46.273 --> 01:36:48.008
Sorry, you work for me.

01:36:48.142 --> 01:36:51.245
All right,
all of you work for me!

01:36:53.247 --> 01:36:54.481
You dumbass. Ha, ha.

01:36:54.616 --> 01:36:56.183
Why are you laughing?

01:36:56.317 --> 01:36:57.985
You idiot.

01:36:58.118 --> 01:37:00.454
They're stealing
Calisto from you.

01:37:00.588 --> 01:37:04.693
They're gonna use it as
a weapon. To assassinate people.

01:37:23.110 --> 01:37:24.211
Beep, bop, bloop.

01:37:24.345 --> 01:37:26.180
Bloop, beep, bloop,
boop, boop!

01:37:29.584 --> 01:37:31.820
- That ought to do it.
- I think so.

01:37:33.454 --> 01:37:36.223
If you would grant root access,
please, Mr. Brok.

01:37:36.357 --> 01:37:38.660
Heh, you're crazy.
Heh, heh.

01:37:38.793 --> 01:37:40.894
I'm not giving you
my access.

01:37:41.028 --> 01:37:42.697
You could alter
the blockchain.

01:37:42.831 --> 01:37:45.667
You could ruin it. You could
literally ruin everything.

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.168
Ow! Ow!

01:37:48.302 --> 01:37:51.205
Our intention is
for Calisto to be released

01:37:51.338 --> 01:37:53.407
into the market as planned.

01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:56.043
In fact, the more units
there are out there

01:37:56.176 --> 01:37:58.178
for me to hack into,
the better.

01:37:58.312 --> 01:37:59.913
Don't do it.
They've killed everyone

01:38:00.047 --> 01:38:02.416
who knows about this
except you and me.

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.854
Mr. Brok is complicit
in the deaths of two people.

01:38:05.986 --> 01:38:09.123
- Oh...
- Now, I am very happy

01:38:09.256 --> 01:38:12.359
to inform my former colleagues
in law enforcement.

01:38:18.232 --> 01:38:19.768
<i>Hello, Alexander.</i>

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.569
<i>Root access granted.</i>

01:38:21.703 --> 01:38:23.937
<i>âª All I do is win, win, win âª</i>

01:38:24.071 --> 01:38:25.740
<i>âª No matter what

01:38:25.874 --> 01:38:27.374
<i>âª I can never get it off âª</i>

01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:29.076
Do you want to answer that?

01:38:30.545 --> 01:38:32.079
No.

01:38:33.882 --> 01:38:35.916
<i>âª All I do is win, win, win
No matter what âª</i>

01:38:36.049 --> 01:38:37.451
Yes.

01:38:37.585 --> 01:38:40.555
<i>âª ...on my mind
I can never get it off âª</i>

01:38:40.688 --> 01:38:42.891
Oh, great.
It's an attempted access alert

01:38:43.023 --> 01:38:45.225
on my personal safe.

01:38:46.927 --> 01:38:48.996
You're up, my dear.

01:38:49.129 --> 01:38:50.330
Go to hell.

01:38:52.266 --> 01:38:56.738
Well, let me see
if I can change your mind.

01:38:56.871 --> 01:39:01.408
Perhaps if I gave you
another delightful surprise.

01:39:01.543 --> 01:39:03.210
âª Ah âª

01:39:05.513 --> 01:39:07.247
Langston. Oh, my God.

01:39:08.949 --> 01:39:11.285
He's been in there
all the time.

01:39:11.418 --> 01:39:14.756
You hid a person
in my Louis XIV?

01:39:14.889 --> 01:39:16.990
What is wrong with you?

01:39:17.124 --> 01:39:19.426
No sense of humor,
that's your problem.

01:40:05.038 --> 01:40:06.508
I was hoping
it would be you.

01:40:09.844 --> 01:40:11.880
- Bitch.
- Fair warning.

01:40:12.012 --> 01:40:14.214
Since we last met,
I made a friend.

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:20.487
Jane, what's the update?

01:40:20.622 --> 01:40:22.857
<i>Yeah!
We're almost done with him.</i>

01:40:22.991 --> 01:40:24.491
You sit tight.

01:40:32.232 --> 01:40:34.401
Switching root access.

01:40:36.538 --> 01:40:38.740
Name and thumbprint.

01:40:38.873 --> 01:40:40.207
John Bosley.

01:40:40.340 --> 01:40:43.678
<i>Hello, John.
Root access granted.</i>

01:40:43.811 --> 01:40:46.280
- Done.
- Good girl.

01:40:46.413 --> 01:40:50.384
I'll have to check, of course,
that it's actually working.

01:40:50.518 --> 01:40:53.220
Calisto, short-range
power burst.

01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:55.757
- No override.
- Ah, whoa, whoa!

01:40:55.890 --> 01:40:58.058
What are you doing?
It will kill us.

01:40:58.191 --> 01:41:00.028
Don't be daft.
It will kill her.

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.430
And what's-his-name. Not us.

01:41:03.565 --> 01:41:07.035
We're gonna be downstairs
enjoying your party. Come on.

01:41:07.167 --> 01:41:10.672
You want me to go down there
and pretend everything's fine?

01:41:10.805 --> 01:41:12.172
Everything is fine.

01:41:12.306 --> 01:41:15.743
You're gonna disrupt
the power industry!

01:41:15.877 --> 01:41:17.545
Go, you.

01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:21.015
You know, retirement
is better than I expected.

01:41:29.824 --> 01:41:32.225
I'm so sorry, Langston.
Oh, God!

01:41:32.359 --> 01:41:33.895
Ah!

01:41:34.028 --> 01:41:35.462
That guy is a total dick.

01:41:44.572 --> 01:41:47.742
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, girl, I got you.

01:41:47.875 --> 01:41:49.209
Of course I got it.

01:41:52.714 --> 01:41:54.448
Have fun, guys.

01:41:54.582 --> 01:41:55.984
See ya!

01:42:01.689 --> 01:42:03.290
- Excuse me. Sorry!
- Hey.

01:42:03.423 --> 01:42:05.927
Whoop! Yow!

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:09.162
This is your party, Alex.
Enjoy it.

01:42:11.633 --> 01:42:14.201
The world is on fire, Alex.

01:42:14.334 --> 01:42:17.437
But I'm sure your generation
is gonna figure it out.

01:42:21.609 --> 01:42:25.613
- Hey, help us!
- There must be a key somewhere.

01:42:27.849 --> 01:42:29.984
You see, it was
my mentor, Edgar,

01:42:30.118 --> 01:42:32.152
who taught me
how to win a fight.

01:42:32.285 --> 01:42:35.489
You thought you beat me
twice before? No.

01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:36.891
I was learning.

01:43:01.314 --> 01:43:03.350
You've got seven moves,
Mr. Hodak.

01:43:10.257 --> 01:43:11.726
I know them all.

01:43:31.112 --> 01:43:32.880
Seven moves...

01:43:33.014 --> 01:43:34.082
and a fragile ego.

01:43:43.290 --> 01:43:46.060
Why is this happening?!

01:43:58.806 --> 01:44:00.908
- Got her.
- <i>Good job.</i>

01:44:02.342 --> 01:44:04.277
- Yes! Oh, ho, ho!
- Sabina! Oh, my God.

01:44:04.411 --> 01:44:06.748
You came for me.
Look at you.

01:44:06.881 --> 01:44:09.449
- Why is that thing doing that?
- Oh, that? That's nothing.

01:44:09.584 --> 01:44:11.919
I just programmed it
to light up and make noises.

01:44:14.222 --> 01:44:15.388
You two, with me.

01:44:17.625 --> 01:44:19.894
Directly to the exit, please.
Get this man help.

01:44:20.027 --> 01:44:23.631
Calm down. Get out.
Everybody go.

01:44:23.765 --> 01:44:25.233
Just get out.

01:44:30.238 --> 01:44:32.439
Do you really think
you'd kill me, old badger?

01:44:32.573 --> 01:44:34.942
You know, Rebecca,
I really did.

01:44:37.145 --> 01:44:39.147
My name is Bosley,

01:44:39.279 --> 01:44:40.681
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:44:44.986 --> 01:44:47.688
You expect me to go quietly
after 40 years?

01:44:50.625 --> 01:44:52.994
This is what I do.

01:45:07.108 --> 01:45:08.609
You're outmanned, Angel.

01:45:09.644 --> 01:45:11.478
You always have been.

01:45:13.781 --> 01:45:15.348
Kill her.

01:45:18.286 --> 01:45:19.854
Send the love.

01:45:52.186 --> 01:45:53.154
Ingrid?

01:46:09.503 --> 01:46:10.872
You've been busy.

01:46:11.005 --> 01:46:12.673
How did you...?

01:46:13.741 --> 01:46:15.676
It's just business, John.

01:46:19.013 --> 01:46:20.181
He's with me now.

01:46:20.314 --> 01:46:22.116
I see.

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:25.953
You know, I built this agency
from the ground up.

01:46:26.087 --> 01:46:29.290
It was supposed to be mine
after Charlie died.

01:46:29.422 --> 01:46:31.592
I was pushed out.

01:46:31.726 --> 01:46:36.297
What did you expect me to do?
Take up gardening?

01:46:36.463 --> 01:46:39.867
You thought you made us.
We made you.

01:46:40.001 --> 01:46:43.371
- Yeah, we trusted you, you dick.
- Good nigh...

01:46:43.504 --> 01:46:45.072
I was in the middle
of my speech.

01:46:45.206 --> 01:46:46.406
Sorry.

01:46:47.541 --> 01:46:48.709
All right, well...

01:46:48.843 --> 01:46:52.079
Sweep it clean, Angels.
Good job.

01:46:58.853 --> 01:47:02.790
So you want to go to California
and train to be an Angel?

01:47:02.924 --> 01:47:04.625
What? I...

01:47:04.759 --> 01:47:06.661
Really? You...

01:47:10.965 --> 01:47:13.100
- Oh, my God.
- We are recruiting you.

01:47:13.234 --> 01:47:14.802
To be an Angel like...

01:47:14.936 --> 01:47:16.436
- you and Jane?
- Let's go.

01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:18.471
What do you
think we've been doing?

01:47:18.606 --> 01:47:19.707
I don't know.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.875
I thought you were smart.

01:47:21.008 --> 01:47:22.910
Isn't that your thing?

01:47:23.044 --> 01:47:24.477
<i>It's done, Charlie.</i>

01:47:24.612 --> 01:47:27.081
<i>And I decided what to do
with Elena Houghlin.</i>

01:47:27.214 --> 01:47:29.317
- <i>What's that?</i>
- <i>She's our new recruit.</i>

01:47:29.449 --> 01:47:30.885
Good. Thank you, Boz.

01:47:31.018 --> 01:47:32.386
<i>Good. Thank you, Boz.</i>

01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:33.921
I appreciate the call.

01:47:34.055 --> 01:47:35.389
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

01:47:37.224 --> 01:47:40.294
- What do you do in California?
- Ever jumped out of a plane?

01:47:40.428 --> 01:47:42.797
- I don't really do heights.
- Oh, um...

01:47:42.930 --> 01:47:44.799
- Have you swam with sharks?
- Hey! It's you.

01:47:44.932 --> 01:47:46.466
How long can you
hold your breath?

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:48.468
Sharks? Not long.

01:47:48.602 --> 01:47:49.937
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:47:50.071 --> 01:47:51.906
What happened to you?

01:47:52.039 --> 01:47:54.275
Wait, you guys
know each other?

01:47:54.408 --> 01:47:56.344
- Yeah, I was eating a sandwich.
- Yeah.

01:47:56.476 --> 01:47:58.779
- I came in, and you gave me the...
- The phosphorus.

01:47:58.913 --> 01:48:00.514
That's my favorite
chemical.

01:48:00.648 --> 01:48:03.017
- Because you were...
- Exactly, mixed with...

01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:06.153
Um, did you...?

01:48:06.287 --> 01:48:08.589
Did you do that?

01:48:08.723 --> 01:48:10.858
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:48:10.992 --> 01:48:14.028
I think he, uh,
finally got the point.

01:48:14.161 --> 01:48:17.031
Is that a pun?
Because you impaled him?

01:48:17.164 --> 01:48:21.702
Are you doing, like, a joke
thing for the handsome nerd?

01:48:21.836 --> 01:48:24.038
- Of course not.
- I mean, it's working,

01:48:24.171 --> 01:48:26.407
if that is
what you're doing.

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:28.576
So if I'm trying
to get in touch with you,

01:48:28.709 --> 01:48:32.046
- how would I do that?
- Oh, don't worry. I'll find you.

01:48:39.387 --> 01:48:40.988
You did that?

01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:44.325
Yeah.

01:48:44.458 --> 01:48:45.926
Elena Houghlin.

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:47.595
Kelly Garrett.

01:48:47.728 --> 01:48:49.330
Welcome to the Townsend Agency.

01:49:02.743 --> 01:49:04.945
You lifted coming
into the last corner.

01:49:05.079 --> 01:49:07.214
You got to trust it.
Go again.

01:49:20.795 --> 01:49:22.930
Hands up. No fear.

01:49:23.064 --> 01:49:24.398
Fight through the pain.

01:49:24.533 --> 01:49:25.733
Focus.

01:49:25.866 --> 01:49:27.768
Try to last
90 seconds this time.

01:49:37.578 --> 01:49:40.714
You must clip the wires

01:49:40.848 --> 01:49:44.185
in the correct order,
or you will...

01:49:44.318 --> 01:49:45.753
- Done!
- ...blow up.

01:49:50.724 --> 01:49:52.561
Good job not dying,
Houghlin.

01:49:52.693 --> 01:49:54.695
The rest of you,
clean up and start again.

01:50:00.034 --> 01:50:03.404
Houghlin, get up! Let's go!
Ten seconds to jump!

01:50:03.538 --> 01:50:05.372
- Everybody up!
- Okay.

01:50:05.507 --> 01:50:08.242
I'm not freaking terrified
at all! Let's go!

01:50:08.375 --> 01:50:10.211
Heaven above,
watch over us today.

01:50:10.344 --> 01:50:11.979
Don't make me a literal angel.

01:50:12.113 --> 01:50:14.648
I've been training for
this moment my whole life!

01:50:14.782 --> 01:50:18.452
All right, recruits!
One final challenge!

01:50:18.587 --> 01:50:22.289
When Ruth Bader Ginsburg
made this jump in '99...

01:50:22.423 --> 01:50:24.191
RBG is an Angel?

01:50:24.325 --> 01:50:25.993
Forget I said that!

01:50:26.127 --> 01:50:27.628
Let's make it happen!

01:50:27.761 --> 01:50:29.997
Be the love!

01:50:30.131 --> 01:50:32.800
Go, Chloe, go! Let's go!

01:50:35.604 --> 01:50:37.872
Get out of there!
Let's go!

01:50:41.175 --> 01:50:43.512
Where do you think
you're going?

01:50:43.644 --> 01:50:45.547
You need to land
this bird, Houghlin.

01:50:45.679 --> 01:50:47.448
I hope I see you
on the ground.

01:50:47.582 --> 01:50:50.484
I really, really do.

01:50:50.619 --> 01:50:52.119
Later.

01:51:00.161 --> 01:51:01.228
Shit!

01:51:01.362 --> 01:51:03.164
Shit. Okay, okay.

01:51:03.297 --> 01:51:04.566
Oh, my God.

01:51:04.698 --> 01:51:06.066
Okay.

01:51:07.368 --> 01:51:09.803
- Oh, I've missed her!
- Yes, yes!

01:51:09.937 --> 01:51:11.739
That's it, baby!
Bring her down!

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.009
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yeah!

01:51:16.343 --> 01:51:18.412
- Woo-hoo!
- Yes!

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.247
Whoo!

01:51:22.716 --> 01:51:24.885
- There she is!
- Yes!

01:51:25.019 --> 01:51:26.621
Good job. You did it!

01:51:28.088 --> 01:51:29.290
Thank you for coming.

01:51:29.423 --> 01:51:30.659
- Of course you did.
- I landed.

01:51:30.791 --> 01:51:31.959
Dude, we weren't worried.

01:51:32.092 --> 01:51:33.160
- A little worried.
- I know.

01:51:33.294 --> 01:51:34.862
Let me smell your breath.

01:51:34.995 --> 01:51:36.531
- She didn't even puke!
- Oh!

01:51:36.665 --> 01:51:38.132
Oh, my gosh.

01:51:38.265 --> 01:51:39.466
Yeah!

01:52:34.955 --> 01:52:38.593
Okay! Sign the chair, make it
official. Don't think about it.

01:52:38.727 --> 01:52:40.995
Here we go, here we go.
Shots, shots, shots!

01:52:41.128 --> 01:52:42.496
- Please, please, please.
- Yeah!

01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:44.198
You made it through training.

01:52:44.331 --> 01:52:46.233
Okay, I'm so nervous,
you guys.

01:52:46.367 --> 01:52:47.468
- Oh, my God!
- Here.

01:52:47.602 --> 01:52:49.970
- Oh, shots. I need it.
- That'll help.

01:52:51.305 --> 01:52:53.140
Okay.

01:52:53.274 --> 01:52:54.341
VoilÃ .

01:52:54.475 --> 01:52:56.176
You ready?
Ass in the chair, lady.

01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:58.479
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

01:52:58.613 --> 01:53:00.481
Oh, God. Guys,
I think I want mine there.

01:53:00.615 --> 01:53:03.183
Is that a good place? I don't
think that hurts as much.

01:53:03.317 --> 01:53:05.754
- That's very sweet.
- Okay, on a scale of one to 10,

01:53:05.886 --> 01:53:07.354
how much does it hurt?
Be honest.

01:53:07.488 --> 01:53:09.123
- Just tell me.
- I no longer feel pain.

01:53:09.256 --> 01:53:11.125
Less than a bullet,
more than a piercing.

01:53:11.258 --> 01:53:13.460
Great. I have no reference
for that. Thank you.

01:53:13.595 --> 01:53:16.096
- <i>Good morning, Angels.</i>
- Good morning, Charlie.

01:53:16.230 --> 01:53:17.965
<i>Elena, congratulations.</i>

01:53:18.098 --> 01:53:19.366
Thank you, Charlie.

01:53:19.501 --> 01:53:21.835
All right.
I'm ready if you are.

01:53:23.971 --> 01:53:26.508
Hell, yeah.
Give me my wings.
