<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:07.515 --> 00:11.067
<i>Beck proves a good hero
is also a humble hero.</i>

00:11.176 --> 00:12.965
What do I do?
Blast through those guards?

00:13.000 --> 00:14.967
- You wouldn't make it.
- Hey.

00:15.002 --> 00:18.971
<i>Zed wishes he had more
from one program...</i>

00:19.006 --> 00:20.907
<i>and less of another.</i>

00:20.941 --> 00:22.501
- And he's kind of handsome.
- Handsome?

00:22.525 --> 00:25.178
I know you think the renegade
is helping, but he's not.

00:25.212 --> 00:29.882
<i>Meanwhile, Tesler maintains
complete control over Argon.</i>

00:29.917 --> 00:31.150
Bring all weapons to bear!

00:33.654 --> 00:35.622
We have a small problem, Sir.

01:04.016 --> 01:07.053
I build Tesler a weapon
of unimaginable power,

01:07.087 --> 01:09.122
and he gives me eight guards.

01:09.156 --> 01:12.758
These dirigibles
are the safest way into Argon.

01:12.793 --> 01:15.027
Great. I feel better already.

01:15.062 --> 01:20.166
- That's the weapon?
- No, this is a box.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.170
What's inside the box,
that's what's important.

01:24.204 --> 01:26.239
<i>Engines offline.</i>

01:26.273 --> 01:29.275
<i>Please stand by
for emergency evacuation.</i>

01:34.114 --> 01:37.083
- The renegade!
- You missed your stop, Shaw.

01:37.117 --> 01:39.785
Grab your bags.
We're getting off.

01:39.820 --> 01:42.054
Looks like you got on the wrong ship!

01:53.100 --> 01:56.169
You're a scientist, Shaw,
not a murderer.

01:56.203 --> 01:59.805
You can help programs, instead
of helping to destroy them.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.308
I can't help these programs
any more than you can.

02:12.052 --> 02:13.886
That's new.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.256
Nice!

02:30.103 --> 02:32.872
So long, renegade.

02:34.523 --> 02:44.023
<b>S01E07 - Price of Power</b>

03:14.127 --> 03:15.895
I've got you.

03:19.866 --> 03:24.103
- Give me your other hand.
- The weapon... it's mine!

03:24.137 --> 03:27.807
I'm trying to help you, Shaw.
I can't hold on.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.208
Give it to me! I need it!

03:30.811 --> 03:31.844
Shaw, don't!

03:47.961 --> 03:49.962
<i>Careful, Zed.</i>

03:49.996 --> 03:52.064
Those things can be dangerous.

03:52.098 --> 03:55.201
Can I help you with something?
I'm kind of busy, and...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.803
Hey!

03:57.838 --> 03:59.238
Not anymore.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.007
We've got direct orders from
commander Paige to be here.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.830
So, if I were you, I'd cooperate.

04:03.855 --> 04:05.655
Cooperate with what?

04:06.880 --> 04:10.015
Tesler's expecting his modified tank

04:10.050 --> 04:12.084
to be ready at the end of this cycle.

04:12.118 --> 04:15.087
And we're here to make sure
that your pretty little hands

04:15.121 --> 04:17.755
work as fast as they can.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.826
My pretty little fists work even faster.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.929
- If you want me to demonstrate...
- Zed. Mara.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.764
Is there a problem?

04:25.799 --> 04:29.001
Yeah, two of them.
But they were just leaving.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.035
What she said!

04:30.036 --> 04:34.006
Oh, well, good.
Lots of work to be done.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.075
No time to stand around chatting.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.013
We'll be back,
and that tank better be finished.

04:41.047 --> 04:45.751
Otherwise, there really will
be a problem.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.220
What he said. Ha ha!

04:51.992 --> 04:55.160
- Here, let me help you.
- I got it.

04:58.932 --> 05:03.168
The renegade derezzed the scientist,
Sir, then made off with the weapon.

05:03.203 --> 05:06.972
And you just let him escape?

05:07.007 --> 05:11.076
Your general just asked you a question.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.945
Answer him.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.992
I accept your resignation.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.863
General, I'll take the lead on this.

05:30.897 --> 05:34.033
Do whatever you have to do,
but bring me that weapon!

05:35.583 --> 05:38.771
<i>A massive power upgrade
in strength and agility.</i>

05:38.805 --> 05:40.739
If this weapon had found
its way to Tesler,

05:40.774 --> 05:42.942
his forces would have been
insurmountable.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.977
So I did good?

05:45.011 --> 05:48.914
What about the scientist?
The idea was to bring him in alive!

05:48.949 --> 05:53.919
He attacked me.
I tried to save him, but I couldn't.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.790
Then this prototype is all
that's left of the technology.

05:57.824 --> 06:02.027
<i>If Tesler believes this was
destroyed, it should buy us some time.</i>

06:02.062 --> 06:03.862
<i>To do what?</i>

06:03.897 --> 06:07.032
- Destroy it.
- How do we do that?

06:07.067 --> 06:11.170
<i>Do you know of any easily accessible
high-powered energy welders?</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:14.073
<i>If only we knew someone
who worked at a garage.</i>

06:14.107 --> 06:17.142
Wait! I work at a garage.

06:17.177 --> 06:21.013
This weapon is far more
dangerous than you know, Beck.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.048
Destroy it immediately.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.086
I'm serious.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.189
When are you ever not serious?

06:30.223 --> 06:34.159
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it, I promise.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.801
Looks like trouble.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.808
<i>They're still inside!</i>

06:52.846 --> 06:55.180
<i>Someone help! Help us!</i>

06:55.215 --> 06:57.950
Hang on. I'll get you out.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.120
Come on, let's go.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.126
On second thought, I'll go.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.174
All right, who's next?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.736
<i>You have something that belongs to me.</i>

07:50.770 --> 07:52.938
You want it? Come get it!

07:52.972 --> 07:54.807
I was hoping you'd say that.

08:34.635 --> 08:37.145
<i>Time is up, Zed.
Where's the tank?</i>

08:37.179 --> 08:38.914
Able's working on it.

08:38.948 --> 08:42.083
- You know, finishing touches.
- We need it now.

08:42.118 --> 08:45.787
That's great, but last I
checked, we don't work for you.

08:45.822 --> 08:49.303
Wrong again, Zed, because we're here
as representatives of Tesler's army.

08:49.399 --> 08:52.127
That's funny...
I don't see any Tesler,

08:52.161 --> 08:54.930
and I certainly don't see any army.

08:54.964 --> 08:57.199
Beck, I can handle this.

08:57.233 --> 09:01.136
If I were you, I'd leave
before things get embarrassing.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.106
You know what's embarrassing?
How fast you're gonna hit the ground...

09:04.140 --> 09:06.074
- The two of us...
- ...versus one of you.

09:06.109 --> 09:09.778
Wow, Hopper, I had
no idea you could count that high.

09:15.415 --> 09:17.920
You're right...
that was embarrassing.

09:17.954 --> 09:21.957
Beck, don't!
What's wrong with you?

09:21.991 --> 09:24.059
You could have seriously hurt them!

09:24.093 --> 09:26.795
Just wait until
Tesler hears about this!

09:26.829 --> 09:29.831
- Gee... thanks a lot, Beck.
- What's your problem?

09:29.866 --> 09:31.186
You should have let me handle it!

09:31.210 --> 09:34.002
Instead you made me look like
a coward in front of Mara.

09:34.037 --> 09:36.171
I didn't make you look like anything.

09:36.205 --> 09:38.840
And if you don't want people
to think you're a coward,

09:38.875 --> 09:40.943
then stop acting like one!

09:45.248 --> 09:48.150
<i>The mods are done.
This is good to go.</i>

09:48.184 --> 09:51.920
So long as general Tesler's
pleased, I'm pleased.

09:51.955 --> 09:56.091
I'll be more pleased once
it's on his base. Ship it.

09:56.125 --> 09:58.827
Tesler's base...

10:26.923 --> 10:29.057
I see my tank has arrived.

10:29.092 --> 10:33.996
- Assemble a team for an inspection.
- Right away, Sir.

10:36.899 --> 10:39.201
Want to know what I see?

10:44.073 --> 10:47.242
I see a coward...

10:47.276 --> 10:50.245
Hiding behind minions and lackeys.

10:50.279 --> 10:53.015
I'm not the one dressing up,

10:53.049 --> 10:56.084
hiding behind the memory
of a dead program!

11:16.272 --> 11:19.941
<i>Looks like you crawled
onto the wrong ship!</i>

11:19.976 --> 11:21.910
Yeah, I get that a lot.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.892
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.128
Tron.

11:40.163 --> 11:41.263
Able.

12:04.987 --> 12:06.088
Great.

12:21.037 --> 12:22.204
Able.

12:22.238 --> 12:24.005
Seal the ship!

12:36.819 --> 12:39.087
<i>Finally. I thought this shift
would never end.</i>

12:39.122 --> 12:41.223
If Able asks me to
pull another double...

12:41.257 --> 12:44.092
Able!
Come on, help me get him inside!

12:44.127 --> 12:48.029
<i>Zed! Mara! Able's been hurt!</i>

12:49.064 --> 12:54.169
Is he all right?
How did this happen?

12:54.203 --> 12:58.240
- Tron.
- He did this?

12:58.274 --> 13:00.242
No. He tried to take out Tesler.

13:00.276 --> 13:03.945
There was an explosion and...
Tron saved me.

13:03.980 --> 13:08.049
Sounds to me like the
renegade almost got you killed.

13:08.084 --> 13:10.185
- Zed!
- What?!

13:10.219 --> 13:13.021
This guy's no Tron.
He's a menace!

13:13.055 --> 13:16.057
And it's only a matter of time
before we all end up casualties

13:16.092 --> 13:18.793
<i>just like Able... or worse.</i>

13:24.000 --> 13:27.802
We searched the ship, Sir.
No sign of him anywhere.

13:27.837 --> 13:30.739
Perhaps, General, it's
time to try a new approach.

13:30.773 --> 13:33.975
Rather than draw out
the renegade using soldiers,

13:34.010 --> 13:36.912
which didn't work out
quite so well for Paige,

13:36.946 --> 13:39.881
might I recommend using
some other form of bait?

13:39.916 --> 13:43.051
Innocent programs, Sir...
hostages.

13:43.085 --> 13:46.087
And where will we find
these hostages?

13:46.122 --> 13:49.191
Sir?
I believe we have a suggestion.

14:02.138 --> 14:04.873
- Go!
- Go!

14:07.843 --> 14:09.044
<i>Hurry!</i>

14:31.100 --> 14:34.803
Greetings, programs.
By orders of general Tesler,

14:34.837 --> 14:38.139
this garage and everyone in it
now belongs to the government.

14:38.174 --> 14:41.776
Consider yourselves...
prisoners of war.

14:43.493 --> 14:46.084
<i>I thought I've told you
to get rid of the weapon.</i>

14:46.085 --> 14:48.675
You lied to me!
If Tesler had recovered it...

14:48.710 --> 14:51.645
- But he didn't.
- You got lucky.

14:51.679 --> 14:54.748
Luck's got nothing to do with it.
I took care of him on my own.

14:54.782 --> 14:58.118
Listen to yourself.
That weapon is poison, Beck.

14:58.152 --> 14:59.886
And now, because of you,

14:59.921 --> 15:02.823
Tesler's ready to derez
everyone in that garage

15:02.857 --> 15:05.926
until you turn it over.
And he won't stop there.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.995
Then help me.

15:09.143 --> 15:13.633
Please.
I can use it to save my friends.

15:13.668 --> 15:17.037
- Teach me how to control it, and...
- You can't!

15:18.071 --> 15:19.906
You have to destroy it.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.977
No. I need it.

15:24.011 --> 15:26.880
Then your friends are already dead.

15:26.914 --> 15:29.750
This kind of power
comes at a price, Beck.

15:29.784 --> 15:32.018
If you won't destroy it, I will.

15:41.062 --> 15:44.030
I... I didn't mean...

15:44.065 --> 15:47.968
Now do you see
why it needs to be destroyed?

15:48.002 --> 15:50.704
I chose you for a reason, Beck.

15:50.738 --> 15:54.674
You're strong...
both physically and mentally.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.810
Now prove it.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.753
You brought them here?

16:06.788 --> 16:08.889
You brought this on yourself.

16:08.923 --> 16:11.591
When I get out of these
restraints, I'm gonna...

16:11.626 --> 16:14.995
You're gonna what? Beat me up?
Teach me a lesson?

16:15.029 --> 16:17.831
I was gonna say... derez you.

17:04.979 --> 17:06.980
<i>Didn't anyone ever tell you?</i>

17:07.013 --> 17:11.617
Never leave your valuables unattended.

17:34.775 --> 17:39.045
My, my, my...
how the mighty have fallen!

17:40.748 --> 17:45.051
I've always been smarter than you,
but now I'm faster!

17:45.086 --> 17:46.987
And stronger!

17:47.021 --> 17:50.023
Now... I'm indestructible!

17:58.900 --> 18:02.002
The renegade!
He's come to save us!

18:03.938 --> 18:05.972
Then who's coming to save him?

18:16.918 --> 18:19.986
Come on.
Help me with the others.

18:20.021 --> 18:23.023
It's intoxicating, isn't it?

18:23.057 --> 18:25.725
<i>Raw, merciless power!</i>

18:30.865 --> 18:32.065
Mara!

18:39.106 --> 18:41.775
<i>Zed!</i>

18:46.747 --> 18:48.014
Head to the tunnel!

18:49.884 --> 18:51.751
I'll meet you down there.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.758
We gotta get out of here!

18:58.793 --> 19:01.861
This way. Follow me!

19:43.037 --> 19:44.905
<i>You took a pretty nasty hit.</i>

19:44.906 --> 19:49.042
- Are you sure you're okay?
- For the hundredth time, yes.

19:49.076 --> 19:51.845
It takes more than that
to keep me down.

19:53.648 --> 19:56.816
I just wish he were here
so I could thank him.

19:56.851 --> 19:58.818
- Who?
- Tron.

19:58.853 --> 20:01.655
Who else? He saved my life.

20:01.689 --> 20:03.023
Saved all of our lives.

20:03.057 --> 20:05.692
Right, the renegade.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.506
- It wasn't Tron.
- What?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.998
He's not the one who saved you.
It was Zed.

20:12.033 --> 20:15.702
Really? You did that?

20:15.736 --> 20:17.737
Well, I, uh... ahem...

20:17.772 --> 20:19.939
It... it was nothing.

20:23.611 --> 20:25.645
Thank you.

20:27.882 --> 20:29.716
You didn't have to do that.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.918
Yeah, I did.
She should know the truth.

20:32.452 --> 20:34.854
How'd you know?

20:34.889 --> 20:37.691
That it was me and not Tron...
uh, the renegade.

20:37.725 --> 20:40.794
- You weren't even there.
- Yeah, but...

20:40.828 --> 20:42.796
Mara doesn't know that.

20:42.830 --> 20:48.001
- I really did save her, ya know?
- I believe you.

20:50.008 --> 20:51.604
<i>Destroyed?!</i>

20:51.639 --> 20:55.709
I promise you, Sir,
I won't disappoint you again.
