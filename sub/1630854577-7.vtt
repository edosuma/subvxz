WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.425
Oh, no! Eggman!

00:11.594 --> 00:14.973
Hate to hit and run,
but I gotta split, Shadow.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.493
Sonic, no!

00:35.577 --> 00:36.578
Chaos control!

01:03.563 --> 01:04.481
Sonic.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.412
Yes, we did it!

01:19.496 --> 01:22.373
Rebel, Knucks, you good?

01:22.457 --> 01:25.251
We're good. Not sure what happened
to your friend, though.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.754
I don't like this.
The Shard could be anywhere.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.215
I better find him
before he portals out of here again.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.299
Back in a flash.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.179
Nine?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.347
Nine?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.681
Nine?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.225
What in the...

01:40.308 --> 01:42.227
Where did that thing come from?

01:42.310 --> 01:43.478
I better check it out.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.648
Huh? What's going on?

01:46.731 --> 01:47.899
Keep going!

01:47.982 --> 01:49.067
Do not stop!

01:49.150 --> 01:50.318
Shadow?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.362
Whoa!

01:59.119 --> 02:01.913
Whoa! Not again!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.417
Wait, is that water?
Please, don't be water.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.253
Please, don't be water.
Please, don't be water.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.671
That's water.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.840
Just when things couldn't get any worse!

02:11.923 --> 02:13.716
Wait! Is that land?

02:15.218 --> 02:17.595
Almost there!

02:20.849 --> 02:21.891
So close.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.150
Okay. Stay calm.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.943
One minute, I was looking for Nine,

02:32.026 --> 02:35.488
then I saw that gnarly ship
and then, somehow...

02:37.699 --> 02:39.367
Wait, where am I?

02:39.450 --> 02:40.535
How did I get...

02:41.578 --> 02:43.997
Ah! Wonder what these guys do.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.583
Ahoy there, stranger!

02:46.666 --> 02:49.294
What brings ye to the No Place?

02:49.794 --> 02:51.546
Seriously?

02:51.629 --> 02:52.630
Pirates?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.758
That's--that's super! Just great!

02:55.842 --> 02:56.968
Of course, you're pirates!

02:57.051 --> 02:59.554
I bet he's one of the old crew.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.805
What should we do?

03:00.889 --> 03:03.474
I say, we pirate!

03:03.558 --> 03:05.977
But the captain's not here.

03:06.060 --> 03:10.607
I don't think he'd approve
of us, you know, "pirating".

03:10.690 --> 03:12.650
What kind of pirates don't pirate?

03:13.359 --> 03:15.486
Well, you know, how the saying goes Rose,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.614
"Dead men tell no tales."

03:18.323 --> 03:19.657
Argh, argh!

03:19.741 --> 03:22.535
I don't mean to harm ye.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.663
I'm just a wayward hedgehog
looking for a way home.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.540
Water!

03:28.207 --> 03:29.125
Argh!

03:29.542 --> 03:31.085
-Hiya!
-No, no, no, no, no!

03:32.253 --> 03:33.296
Yikes!

03:33.838 --> 03:35.381
Hiya! Hiya!

03:44.015 --> 03:44.974
Whoa!

03:45.058 --> 03:48.978
Boy, it sure feels good
to a pirate, don't it?

03:49.062 --> 03:49.938
Oi!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.815
Leave him to the brisket!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.239
Gotcha!

04:01.074 --> 04:02.742
Well, wouldn't you know it.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.870
I'm caught between the devil
and the deep blue sea.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.791
You know, he's too fast
to be part of the old crew.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.835
Listen, I am not a part of any
crew you're looking for.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.213
In fact, I've lost my crew.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.173
It's a bit of a sore spot actually.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.342
I'll give you a sore spot, all right?

04:19.425 --> 04:22.136
All right, all right. Enough's enough!

04:22.220 --> 04:23.763
Gather the coconuts.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.598
The captain would want us
to get back to the ship

04:25.682 --> 04:27.016
without taking too long.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.102
Leave this scalawag for the buzzards.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.730
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.483
Wait, you're leaving?

04:37.443 --> 04:38.903
Uh, you can't leave me here.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.656
There's literally water everywhere.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.409
Uh, where're you going?
Somewhere with a lot of land, hopefully.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.120
Back to our ship.
And we don't take scalawags.

04:47.203 --> 04:51.874
You know, with all that speed,
this land lover could be useful.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.794
Swabbing the deck,
raising the mizzen mast,

04:54.877 --> 04:56.129
rowing the boat.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.923
I hate rowing the boat.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.717
I'll row! I'm a great rower!

05:00.800 --> 05:04.971
I'll bet you 20 coconuts
I'm the best rower you've ever seen!

05:05.054 --> 05:07.432
Fine! I, too, hate the rowing.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.935
But, there is one condition
when we get back to the ship.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.856
It's Captain's orders or else!

05:14.939 --> 05:16.524
Or else? The plank?

05:16.607 --> 05:20.903
I can assure you that this hedgehog
has no interest in planks.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.697
Captain's orders. Got it!

05:22.780 --> 05:24.240
I love captains.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.661
Whoa! Is that your ship?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.585
'Tis indeed.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.086
Now, move along!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.756
You need to hurry to get a good seat.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.384
Everybody got seat belts on?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.261
Seat belts?

05:51.142 --> 05:52.351
Well, that was quick.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.033
Urgh. Looks like someone had
a few too many coconuts last night.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.162
You guys should really consider
cleaning that poop deck.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.623
Where's this captain you speak of?

06:13.706 --> 06:14.582
Argh!

06:14.665 --> 06:17.710
Who'd be the scalawag
you brought on board?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.631
Sonic, meet Dread.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.633
<i>The </i>Dread.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.558
The Dread is... Knuckles?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.361
I'm Knuckles, the guardian of this island.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.823
Consider this your first
and final warning.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.576
-Does that count as a warning?

06:52.161 --> 06:53.246
Allow me to offer my delicate

06:53.329 --> 06:54.997
and restrain response.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.666
-Spin Dash!

06:58.167 --> 06:59.210
You blocked that?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.090
Okay. Time out! Let's start over.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.508
Hi, I'm Sonic, and--

07:05.591 --> 07:07.218
Don't waste your breath, thief.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.262
Eggman warned me about you.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.264
I know all I need to know.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.226
Yeah, does makes sense.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.979
But you're pirate, Knuckles.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.481
I am not taking any chances.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.942
Fire?

07:23.317 --> 07:24.777
Fire!

07:24.861 --> 07:26.487
-Wait.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.572
Dinner?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.369
Dinner!

07:33.453 --> 07:35.371
I will trade you
that sword of yours

07:35.455 --> 07:38.416
for this nice, shiny apple.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.252
So you can stuff it in my mouth?

07:41.335 --> 07:42.545
No, thanks.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.673
You do know hedgehog quills
are a choking hazard, don't you?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.344
Don't you worry.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.597
The fire isn't to cook you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.266
It's to welcome you!

08:09.780 --> 08:11.908
Definitely not the Knuckles I know.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.702
Besides, have you seen yer legs?

08:14.785 --> 08:16.787
I've seen more meat on a starfish.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.249
Wait. This really is a party?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.376
Sure is!

08:22.460 --> 08:25.338
But we don't cross
new adventurers that often.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.132
You're officially
my favorite Knuckles ever.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.638
Is this a chili dog?

08:33.721 --> 08:35.139
More like a sea dog.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.891
A sea dog?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.142
What's it made of?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.811
Don't ask.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.440
Hm.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.737
Oh, you have no idea
how much I needed that!

08:49.820 --> 08:52.156
Well,
ye've come to the right place.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.284
We're all about "no ideas" here.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.499
So, "Dread the Dread",

09:01.582 --> 09:02.667
first I wasn't sure,

09:02.750 --> 09:06.087
but it turns out you're not
the scourgiest in the slightest.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.507
Well, that depends on who you ask.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.927
Black Rose, am I the toughest
pirate on the seas?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.554
Aye, Captain!

09:15.304 --> 09:16.806
If you're such a friendly pirate,

09:16.889 --> 09:19.016
how'd you get a name like "The Dread"?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.644
Oh, he wasn't always so friendly!

09:21.727 --> 09:23.563
He used to be the...

09:23.646 --> 09:26.899
That's a story for another time, Batten.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.943
A better question would be

09:29.026 --> 09:32.697
"How did you end up alone
on that island with no boat?"

09:32.780 --> 09:37.910
Well, hang on to your hat
because I have got a doozy.

09:40.162 --> 09:42.206
-No, no, no, no, no.

09:49.088 --> 09:51.173
And then I ended up here.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.595
Sounds like you need a vacation!

09:57.096 --> 10:00.141
Sounds really tempting,
but I really gotta get--

10:00.224 --> 10:01.601
No buts!

10:01.684 --> 10:04.562
Especially not during a limbo contest!

10:17.033 --> 10:20.161
But, seeing as we're not
going anywhere.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.538
Hold on to your eye patches, mateys!

10:22.622 --> 10:26.500
'Cause I'm about to show you
how low this hedgehog can go!

11:00.368 --> 11:02.328
That was a late night.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.084
Whoa!

11:08.167 --> 11:09.085
I'm awake!

11:13.130 --> 11:17.635
Ah, there it is, Green Hill.
Just like all the other places.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.724
Water.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.769
That stuff's the worst, am I right?

11:28.312 --> 11:31.107
So, what's the plan, Captain D?
Where are we headed?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.274
We aren't.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.527
Say again?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.278
Look around you.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.407
We need to take it easy and enjoy the day.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.035
Just like we do every day.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.871
This calls for a song!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.544
Another party?

11:51.627 --> 11:53.504
Didn't we kind of do that last night?

11:54.296 --> 11:55.464
Relax!

11:55.548 --> 11:56.882
Have a sea dog.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.844
Let your cares sail off into the sunset.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.846
It's first thing in the morning.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.390
Close enough. Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.936
No! No, sorry.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.647
I love kicking back
as much as the next hedgehog,

12:11.730 --> 12:14.191
but I have places to be and people to see.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.152
I need to get outta here,

12:16.235 --> 12:18.696
and to do that I need to find a Shard.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.116
What be a "Shard?"

12:22.199 --> 12:26.162
It's like a rock that glows
and might be magic?

12:27.830 --> 12:28.873
Whoa!

12:29.790 --> 12:33.294
That sounds like the stone
from the Incident!

12:34.086 --> 12:37.089
Aye! "The Devil's Lighthouse."

12:38.424 --> 12:41.802
That we don't speak of ever!

12:41.886 --> 12:44.430
Wait! You know about the Shard?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.599
You need to tell me where it is!

12:46.682 --> 12:50.060
Forget it!
That treasure brings nothing but pain.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.562
I can't forget it.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.980
My friends need me,

12:53.063 --> 12:54.607
and I need it to get back to them.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.777
Leave it be.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.948
Huh?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.249
Captain! We're under attack!

13:12.333 --> 13:15.586
It would be yer old crew again.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.214
Argh! Take yer positions!

13:19.298 --> 13:22.009
They want to fight? We'll give them one!

13:22.092 --> 13:23.427
Right, Dread?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.346
Uh, Dread?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.972
Dread?

13:27.056 --> 13:28.516
Dread?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.851
Is he hiding?

13:47.952 --> 13:50.871
Sorry, but this hedgehog
is not about to roll over

13:50.955 --> 13:52.665
for a few lousy pirates.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.875
But we be pirates!

13:54.959 --> 13:58.420
I meant those pirates,
not you pirates!

14:04.218 --> 14:06.011
Take them for everything they've got!

14:06.095 --> 14:08.847
Boy, I do love messing with this bunch!

14:08.931 --> 14:11.475
Nothing beats sticking it
to our old captain!

14:12.059 --> 14:13.852
And these tasty sea dogs.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.147
I'd like to watch old Dread
quake in his boots,

14:17.231 --> 14:20.317
and then take them for every
last sea dog in that galley.

14:23.612 --> 14:27.533
Almost makes me
feel sad for them, almost.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.287
Put the sea dog down!

14:32.913 --> 14:35.249
Back to your boat or else!

14:37.459 --> 14:40.379
Is he really gonna fight them?

14:40.462 --> 14:43.257
Bold talk for a lad with no sword.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.175
Gosh, gosh! You're right.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.636
Oh, whatever will I do?

14:50.222 --> 14:53.267
We'll find out! Boys, let's get 'em!

15:03.110 --> 15:04.612
Don't say I didn't warn you.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.824
Argh! Argh-argh-argh!

15:08.908 --> 15:10.492
My turn.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.167
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.085
Can't swim! Can't swim!

15:21.962 --> 15:24.548
Whoa! Okay. That's cool!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.884
My kicks are like hovercrafts!

15:29.303 --> 15:31.013
Whoa!

15:32.139 --> 15:34.934
Oh, so cool!

15:35.017 --> 15:36.226
Huh?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.326
You're done for!

15:57.790 --> 16:00.709
Enough! We surrender! We surrender!

16:00.793 --> 16:03.045
Argh! Givin' up already?

16:03.128 --> 16:05.506
Takes the fun right out of it, don't it?

16:05.589 --> 16:06.757
Oh!

16:06.840 --> 16:10.678
I've waited a long time
to deal out some pirate justice!

16:11.387 --> 16:13.097
And by "pirate justice,"

16:13.180 --> 16:15.891
we mean a stern warning
to get back on your ship

16:15.975 --> 16:17.267
and leave us alone.

16:17.685 --> 16:18.936
Right?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.896
Ugh. Fine.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.147
-Retreat!
-Run!

16:22.231 --> 16:23.399
-Run away!
-Run!

16:23.482 --> 16:25.317
Pleasure doing business with ya'.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
Thanks for the sea dogs.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.407
Sonic!

16:31.490 --> 16:33.367
Show them, scalawags!

16:33.450 --> 16:34.910
Whoo!

16:38.122 --> 16:40.165
Okay, Dread, where's the Shard?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.792
Enough stalling!

16:41.875 --> 16:44.545
Tell Captain Sonic what he wants to know.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.630
"Captain"? I'm not the captain.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.507
Aye, you are now, Captain.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.385
You have given us a taste
for the pirate life,

16:51.468 --> 16:53.012
and we want more, Captain.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.809
Forget it. And stop calling me captain.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.060
Aye, Captain.

17:00.144 --> 17:03.313
And just tell me
about "The incident."

17:04.690 --> 17:06.233
I begged you to leave it alone,

17:06.316 --> 17:08.944
but you're just too stubborn, aren't ye?

17:09.028 --> 17:09.987
I've been called worse.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.865
Fine. Black Rose, tell the tale.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.324
Yes!

17:14.408 --> 17:15.993
Oh. Sorry.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.621
Just remember, you're the one
who asked for this.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.417
It was years ago.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.087
<i>Knuckles The Dread</i>
<i>was the most feared pirate</i>

17:27.171 --> 17:28.964
<i>that sailed the seas.</i>

17:29.048 --> 17:32.926
<i>Fame, treasure, power, he had it all.</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:36.764
<i>But there was one prize</i>
<i>that eluded his grasp...</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:39.308
The Devil's Lighthouse!

17:39.391 --> 17:42.061
Let me tell the story, Sails!

17:42.144 --> 17:44.229
Sorry.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.647
Now, where was I?

17:45.731 --> 17:46.815
Oh, right.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.651
<i>The Devil's Lighthouse.</i>

17:49.735 --> 17:51.737
<i>Captain'd spent years looking,</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:56.992
<i>and he'd finally gotten his mitts</i>
<i>on the map that would lead him to it.</i>

17:58.368 --> 18:00.537
What's a pirate need
with a lighthouse?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.791
The Devil's Lighthouse
isn't a lighthouse at all.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.503
It's a gem, priceless beyond imagining,

18:07.586 --> 18:12.424
who's heart glows with a light
enough to pierce the densest of fogs!

18:12.508 --> 18:14.843
The Shard! Where is it? Do you have it?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.013
Right, listen to the story.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.431
Sorry.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.101
With the map, I knew the location.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.187
All I needed to do was get to it.

18:27.981 --> 18:30.150
Keep that sail full o' wind!

18:30.234 --> 18:31.527
Steady as she goes!

18:34.780 --> 18:36.990
Captain, change course!

18:37.074 --> 18:39.576
We'll wreck on those rocks for sure!

18:39.660 --> 18:41.870
Turn around, Captain! We're beggin' ya!

18:41.954 --> 18:44.498
Get offa me, ya yellow-bellied dog!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.422
<i>The crew thought I'd lost me marbles.</i>

18:52.506 --> 18:54.424
Captain, you lost your marbles!

18:54.508 --> 18:55.592
<i>And they were right.</i>

18:55.676 --> 18:58.971
<i>My only thought was getting</i>
<i>my hands on that stone,</i>

18:59.054 --> 19:01.181
<i>no matter what.</i>

19:03.058 --> 19:04.893
I'm too far, Captain.

19:41.638 --> 19:45.058
Over here! Pick me up! That's an order!

19:45.142 --> 19:46.393
Leave him be.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.020
There's not enough room!

19:48.103 --> 19:50.022
You showed us
that you don't care, Captain.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.941
You're the captain now, Jack.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.777
No!

19:56.528 --> 19:59.281
The Devil's Lighthouse took me reputation

19:59.364 --> 20:01.450
and me courage.

20:01.533 --> 20:05.495
I swore I'd never go near
that cursed stone again.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.289
But you're Knuckles The Dread!

20:07.372 --> 20:10.500
You survived a shipwreck,
you've got a gold tooth!

20:10.584 --> 20:12.753
You are a pirate, Dread, a pirate!

20:12.836 --> 20:14.254
Help me find that map,

20:14.338 --> 20:16.340
and I'll help you get your pirate on.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.592
That map's
at the bottom of the sea,

20:18.675 --> 20:20.260
sunk with me old ship.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.221
I've lost my way, boyo.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.430
You want the map?

20:23.513 --> 20:24.806
Find it yourself.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.933
Gone?

20:26.016 --> 20:28.227
But that means... I'm trapped here.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.854
If it's not too much of a bother, Sonic,

20:30.938 --> 20:32.231
would you mind me taking a gander

20:32.314 --> 20:33.815
at them fancy boots of yours?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.235
Yeah, sure. They're pretty awesome.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.278
Of course!

20:38.362 --> 20:39.404
We don't need the map.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.990
We can find the Shard with my kicks!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.367
They're boots.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
Huh, no glow this way.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.456
Nothing here.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.707
Wait!

20:51.959 --> 20:53.085
This way!

20:53.168 --> 20:54.086
I think.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.671
Aye, aye, Captain!

21:01.426 --> 21:05.389
So yer stealing me crew,
me ship, and me job?

21:05.472 --> 21:07.557
What? Me? Steal?

21:07.641 --> 21:08.934
-No!
-Fine.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.395
Lemme explain-- Did you just say "fine"?

21:11.478 --> 21:15.023
Did ye not just listen
to me tale of terror and despair?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.359
I'm sorry, but I need that Shard.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.529
Then their fates are in your hands.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.951
Captain! There's something in the water
off the port side!

21:26.034 --> 21:26.952
Could be a whale.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.996
It's not an orca, is it?

21:29.454 --> 21:31.290
Port's the other side.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.457
I knew that.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.801
That's no whale.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.654
Rusty Rose?

22:02.738 --> 22:03.864
How are you here?

22:03.947 --> 22:06.116
You underestimate the council.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.369
Time for you to go down with your ship.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.662
Fire.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.710
Oh, coconuts.
