- I DON'T KNOW.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.436
HALF A HEMISPHERE?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.105
- HIDDEN BELOW.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.608
DOES THAT MEAN
HIDDEN IN THE CELLAR?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.776
- WE STILL NEED TO COLLECT

11:33.859 --> 11:35.027
A SAMPLE OF THE ELIXIR AS WELL,
REMEMBER?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.445
AND WE KNOW WHERE HE
KEEPS IT NOW.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.655
- WE NEED TO GO BACK DOWN THERE.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.407
- WHY DOES SHE KEEP SAYING THAT?

11:39.490 --> 11:41.951
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GO!

11:42.034 --> 11:42.618
- TO KEEP RISKS AT A MINIMUM,

11:42.701 --> 11:44.578
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST

11:44.662 --> 11:45.913
LET ONE PERSON GO DOWN THERE
THIS TIME.

11:45.996 --> 11:47.123
- GREAT PLAN, FABS!

11:47.206 --> 11:48.332
I'LL STAY HERE
AND HOLD THE FORT.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.042
- WELL, DRAW STRAWS FOR IT,
YEAH?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.669
- OR WE CAN JUST DO IT
THAT WAY.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.090
[bell tolling]

12:00.136 --> 12:03.055
- WHOA, HAVE YOU WON
THE LOTTERY?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.390
- YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
ALFIE.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.808
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.309
GET OVER THERE AND CHECK OUT
WHAT THE SCOOBY GANG IS UP TO,

12:07.393 --> 12:09.603
AND YOU MIGHT JUST GET

12:09.687 --> 12:11.230
THAT MAGIC SET
THAT YOU'VE BEEN WANTING.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.731
YEAH?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
COME ON.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.485
- [sighs]

12:16.569 --> 12:18.028
HEY, ARE THOSE THE STRAWS?

12:18.112 --> 12:20.322
- WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
TO JEROME ABOUT?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.492
- OH, YOU KNOW,
THE USUAL.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.453
WHERE TO HANG,
WHAT TO SCAM,

12:25.536 --> 12:26.996
WHO TO SNARL AT.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.707
I'M FED UP WITH HIM,
TO BE HONEST.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.292
- SO THESE ROM-COMS,

12:31.375 --> 12:34.628
TELL ME AGAIN
HOW THEY WORK.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.673
- OKAY, BOY MEETS GIRL.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.383
BOY FALLS IN LOVE WITH GIRL.
BOY DOES SOMETHING BAD.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.844
GIRL FINISHES WITH BOY.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.471
BOY HAS TO MAKE
BIG SACRIFICE,

12:43.554 --> 12:45.681
INCLUDING HUMILIATING HIMSELF
IN FRONT OF GIRL,

12:45.764 --> 12:47.391
IN ORDER TO WIN HER BACK.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.392
IT'S THE SAME EVERY TIME.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.602
THAT'S WHY I LOVE THEM.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.396
- SEE, IT'S THE HUMILIATING
MYSELF PART

12:52.480 --> 12:54.231
THAT'S NOT REALLY
APPEALING TO ME.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.399
- LISTEN UP.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.150
I'VE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.320
[whispering]

12:59.403 --> 13:00.362
- HUH, YEAH, RIGHT.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.822
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.206
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WILL WORK?

13:10.289 --> 13:11.790
- I'M A GENIUS.
TRUST ME.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.291
- OKAY.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.084
FIX IT UP.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.550
- SO PATRICIA'S GOT US
SOME WALKIE-TALKIES.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.677
- THIS WILL BE BETTER
THAN THE LOUD WHISPERING

13:23.761 --> 13:24.720
WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR.

13:24.803 --> 13:25.596
- HERE'S AMBER.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.515

13:27.598 --> 13:28.724

13:28.807 --> 13:30.601
IS ACTUALLY BECOMING
KIND OF FUN.

13:30.684 --> 13:31.727
- YOU SHOULD LET ME PUT YOUR

13:31.810 --> 13:33.771
LOVE LIFE IN ORDER,
PATRICIA.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.523
- I'D RATHER CHEW ON GLASS.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.611
- OH, POOR ALFIE.

13:40.694 --> 13:41.612
- OKAY THEN.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.155
ALFIE IT IS.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.448
PERFECT.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.597
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:08.681 --> 14:09.765
- PLAYING TENNIS.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.517
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

14:13.143 --> 14:14.436
- ARE YOU STILL
GOING OUT TONIGHT?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.855
- YES, AND I SHAN'T BE BACK

14:16.939 --> 14:18.899
SO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR LOCKUP

14:18.983 --> 14:20.609
AND LIGHTS OUT.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.986

14:22.069 --> 14:25.489
I'VE GOT MY PIN,
AND IT'S READY TO DROP.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.073
[giggling]

14:31.579 --> 14:34.456
- OH, ALFIE, YOU ALMOST

14:34.540 --> 14:36.125
DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

14:36.208 --> 14:37.293

14:40.337 --> 14:42.673
SO TONIGHT IS DEFINITELY
THE NIGHT.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.465
- THE NIGHT FOR WHAT?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.801
- UH, THE GIRLS AND I

14:45.884 --> 14:48.637
ARE PLANNING ON WATCHING
A DVD AFTER LIGHTS OUT TONIGHT.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.432
IT'S NO BIG THING.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.642
- OKAY.
HEY, ALFIE.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.393
HOW ABOUT YOU AND ME

15:08.699 --> 15:10.492
[yawns]

15:10.576 --> 15:12.244
GOOD FILM.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.495
READY TO GO TO BED THOUGH.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.205
- OH, DON'T BE

I'VE GOT <i> ZOMBIE SLASHERS 2</i>

16:55.889 --> 16:57.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
RIGHT?

16:57.516 --> 16:59.101
- GETTING A SAMPLE
OF THE ELIXIR

16:59.184 --> 16:59.977
AND LOOKING

17:00.060 --> 17:01.395
WHATEVER
A DEMISPHERE MIGHT BE.
