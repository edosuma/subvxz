00:07.736 --> 00:08.903
<i>And that's your biggest worry?</i>

00:08.903 --> 00:11.281
<i>Yes, any kind of virus, but most probably
something similar to influenza.</i>

00:11.281 --> 00:12.615
1968

00:12.615 --> 00:13.700
<i>Because of air travel.</i>

00:13.700 --> 00:14.743
<i>Through the air.</i>

00:14.743 --> 00:16.244
- Coughing--
- I'm sorry.

00:16.244 --> 00:18.204
I meant people. On planes.

00:18.204 --> 00:19.706
That was something
you described in your book.

00:19.706 --> 00:21.666
Yes, a new virus in Madagascar, say,

00:21.666 --> 00:23.793
could be in Chicago
within a matter of weeks.

00:23.793 --> 00:26.796
And we end up with a global pandemic.
Pan meaning "all."

00:26.796 --> 00:29.132
The whole world becomes sick all at once.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.136
And, Dr. Neuman,
you're also an epidemiologist.

00:33.136 --> 00:36.181
I presume the prospect of a viral pandemic
keeps you up at night as well.

00:36.181 --> 00:37.474
- No.
- No?

00:37.474 --> 00:39.100
- No.
- All right, well, that's our show.

00:40.435 --> 00:43.271
No, mankind has been at war with the virus
from the start.

00:43.271 --> 00:46.566
Sometimes, millions of people die,
as in an actual war.

00:46.566 --> 00:49.027
But in the end, we always win.

00:49.027 --> 00:52.280
But you-- just to be clear, you do think
microorganisms pose a threat.

00:52.989 --> 00:54.866
In the most dire terms.

00:54.866 --> 00:56.451
- Bacteria.
- No.

00:56.451 --> 00:58.244
- You like saying no.
- Yes.

00:59.954 --> 01:01.831
Not bacteria. Not viruses.

01:01.831 --> 01:03.792
- So?
- Fungus.

01:05.585 --> 01:07.003
Yes, that's the usual response.

01:07.462 --> 01:09.172
Fungi seem harmless enough.

01:09.172 --> 01:11.049
Many species know otherwise.

01:11.049 --> 01:14.469
Because there are some fungi
who seek not to kill,

01:14.469 --> 01:15.762
but to control.

01:15.762 --> 01:18.556
Let me ask you,
where do we get LSD from?

01:18.556 --> 01:20.475
Where do you get it from?

01:20.475 --> 01:22.769
It comes from ergot, a fungus.

01:22.769 --> 01:25.146
Psilocybin? Also a fungus.

01:25.146 --> 01:29.192
Viruses can make us ill,
but fungi can alter our very minds.

01:29.192 --> 01:31.194
There's a fungus that infects insects.

01:31.194 --> 01:32.862
Gets inside an ant, for example,

01:32.862 --> 01:36.491
travels through its circulatory system
to the ant's brain,

01:36.491 --> 01:38.535
and then floods it with hallucinogens,

01:38.535 --> 01:41.830
thus bending the ant's mind to its will.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.873
The fungus starts
to direct the ant's behavior,

01:43.873 --> 01:45.500
telling it where to go, what to do,

01:45.500 --> 01:47.794
like a puppeteer with a marionette.

01:47.794 --> 01:49.212
And it gets worse.

01:49.212 --> 01:50.797
The fungus needs food to live,

01:50.797 --> 01:54.217
so it begins to devour
its host from within,

01:54.217 --> 01:56.803
replacing the ant's flesh with its own,

01:56.803 --> 01:58.596
but it doesn't let its victim die.

01:58.596 --> 02:03.977
No, it keeps its puppet alive
by preventing decomposition.

02:03.977 --> 02:06.479
How? Where do we get penicillin from?

02:06.479 --> 02:07.397
Fungus.

02:09.190 --> 02:10.233
Dr. Schoenheiss, you're in distress.

02:10.233 --> 02:13.319
Fungal infection of this kind is real,
but not in humans.

02:13.319 --> 02:15.321
True, fungi cannot survive

02:15.321 --> 02:19.117
if its host's internal temperature
is over 94 degrees.

02:19.117 --> 02:21.786
And currently, there are no reasons
for fungi to evolve

02:21.786 --> 02:23.246
to be able to withstand
higher temperatures.

02:23.246 --> 02:24.706
But what if that were to change?

02:24.706 --> 02:27.625
What if, for instance,

02:27.625 --> 02:30.169
the world were to get slightly warmer?

02:30.628 --> 02:33.798
Well, now there is reason to evolve.

02:33.798 --> 02:38.261
One gene mutates and an ascomycete,
candida, ergot,

02:38.261 --> 02:41.264
cordyceps, aspergillus,
any one of them could become

02:41.264 --> 02:43.349
capable of burrowing into our brains

02:43.349 --> 02:47.228
and taking control not of millions of us,
but billions of us.

02:47.228 --> 02:50.565
Billions of puppets with poisoned minds

02:50.565 --> 02:53.443
permanently fixed on one unifying goal:

02:53.443 --> 02:57.906
to spread the infection
to every last human alive

02:57.906 --> 02:59.365
by any means necessary.

02:59.365 --> 03:00.742
And there are no treatments for this.

03:00.742 --> 03:03.369
No preventatives, no cures.

03:03.369 --> 03:06.289
They don't exist.
It's not even possible to make them.

03:07.749 --> 03:09.083
So, if that happens?

03:11.085 --> 03:12.629
We lose.

03:16.549 --> 03:17.800
We'll be back.

04:19.862 --> 04:24.826
THE LAST OF US

04:29.706 --> 04:33.418
2003

04:59.652 --> 05:00.903
Alarm.

05:02.238 --> 05:03.197
Alarm!

05:19.797 --> 05:22.592
- Where's the pancake mix?
- Oh, was I--

05:22.592 --> 05:24.010
Yeah, I was. Sorry.

05:24.010 --> 05:25.720
I was gonna make you birthday pancakes.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.055
I swear.

05:27.055 --> 05:28.723
You know I don't really like pancakes.

05:28.723 --> 05:31.350
I know you don't like them.
It was for my benefit.

05:35.563 --> 05:36.397
Vitamin C.

05:45.364 --> 05:47.116
You get your homework done?

05:49.368 --> 05:50.328
Fractions?

05:53.539 --> 05:54.916
How old are you again?

05:54.916 --> 05:55.792
Thirty-six.

05:56.751 --> 05:57.919
Gonna have to wear diapers soon.

05:57.919 --> 05:59.545
Who says I don't already?

06:02.965 --> 06:03.841
Shell.

06:03.841 --> 06:04.967
Calcium.

06:05.635 --> 06:06.761
Lovely.

06:08.387 --> 06:09.639
Is there enough for Uncle Tommy?

06:09.639 --> 06:11.057
Well, there would've been.

06:13.976 --> 06:15.311
You're still alive, you old fucker.

06:15.311 --> 06:17.021
Aw. He loves you.

06:17.021 --> 06:18.981
He's dependent on me. Not the same.

06:18.981 --> 06:21.150
- I think it's the same.
- It's definitely the same.

06:21.150 --> 06:22.777
I thought we was havin' pancakes.

06:23.736 --> 06:25.113
We'll pick you somethin' up on the road.

06:25.113 --> 06:27.323
- Concrete guys gonna be there?
- Yeah, they said maybe.

06:27.323 --> 06:29.075
Maybe? We can't frame until we pour.

06:29.075 --> 06:30.451
We're not gettin' paid until we frame.

06:30.451 --> 06:31.994
Well, we could bring someone else on,

06:31.994 --> 06:33.287
- get the job done faster.
- No, no.

06:33.287 --> 06:34.330
I'm not splittin' this job.

06:34.330 --> 06:35.998
I barely wanna split it with you.

06:35.998 --> 06:37.416
We could work a double.

06:37.416 --> 06:39.961
- Literally? Today?
- I know. I'd be done by nine.

06:39.961 --> 06:41.462
By nine, right?

06:42.255 --> 06:43.047
Yeah.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.591
I'll bring back a cake.

06:46.175 --> 06:47.093
I promise.

06:49.804 --> 06:52.181
<i>...continued disturbances in Jakarta,</i>

06:52.181 --> 06:53.599
<i>but are advising U.S. citizens...</i>

06:53.599 --> 06:55.768
Jakarta. Where is that, Middle East?

06:55.768 --> 06:57.770
Doesn't ring a bell.
It's definitely a country.

06:57.770 --> 07:00.064
- Or maybe part of Asia?
- Jakarta isn't a country.

07:00.064 --> 07:02.650
Being a part of Asia isn't mutually
exclusive with being a country,

07:02.650 --> 07:04.777
and in fact,
it's the capital of Indonesia.

07:05.194 --> 07:07.280
Shit. Hope for us yet.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.037
All right.

07:15.997 --> 07:17.623

08:21.729 --> 08:22.605
Oh, Hi.

08:23.231 --> 08:27.276

08:27.276 --> 08:28.694

08:37.578 --> 08:38.788

08:49.507 --> 08:50.424

08:50.883 --> 08:52.677
But I'm on Atkins.

08:52.677 --> 08:55.388
- On what now?
- It's, you know what?

08:55.388 --> 08:57.139
We gotta run, but Sarah'll be by later.

08:57.139 --> 08:58.933
She'll stay as long as you want.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.185
Tell ya all about Atkins.

09:01.185 --> 09:03.980
Great! I'll let Connie know.

09:03.980 --> 09:04.981
Solid.

09:08.442 --> 09:11.153
Can't tell you how exciting it was
listenin' to that fuckin' conversation.

I could've stolen 60,
but I put the change back

16:32.052 --> 16:33.721
because I'm an honest thief.

16:33.721 --> 16:35.556
Besides, it's the thought that counts.

16:35.556 --> 16:37.850
And you were never gonna
do it for yourself, so.

16:42.938 --> 16:44.064
Thank you.

16:46.984 --> 16:47.901
There's one more.

16:50.988 --> 16:53.115
- Borrowed it from the Adlers.
- This is the one with the deleted scenes.

16:53.115 --> 16:54.158
"ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES
I'VE EVER SEEN"

16:54.158 --> 16:56.368
Yeah, imagine how bad those have to be.

16:56.368 --> 16:58.996
C'mon, pop it in.
While it's still your birthday.

17:08.297 --> 17:10.007
- Don't fall asleep.
-'Course, I won't.

17:10.007 --> 17:11.717
It's too riveting.

17:33.864 --> 17:34.823
Hello?

17:34.823 --> 17:36.241
<i>Joel, it's me.</i>

17:37.034 --> 17:37.951
<i>I'm okay.</i>

17:38.494 --> 17:40.621
- Yeah?
-<i>But I'm in jail.</i>

17:41.580 --> 17:43.832
- Goddammit.
-<i>Wasn't my fault this time.</i>

17:43.832 --> 17:46.794
<i>I was at the bar, some guy goes crazy,
starts swingin' at a waitress,</i>

17:46.794 --> 17:48.587
<i>I stepped in, knocked him out,
cops show up--</i>

17:48.587 --> 17:50.005
<i>Look, it doesn't fuckin' matter.</i>

17:50.005 --> 17:51.548
-<i>You gotta bail me out.</i>
- Now?

17:51.548 --> 17:54.551
<i>It's Friday, you don't get me out tonight,
I'm in here all weekend.</i>

17:54.551 --> 17:56.345
<i>It's a fuckin' madhouse, Joel.</i>

17:56.345 --> 17:58.847
-<i>I gotta get out.</i>
- Well, which jail? Travis County?

17:58.847 --> 18:00.265
<i>Yeah, on 10th.</i>

18:00.265 --> 18:02.893
- Goddammit, Tommy.
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>

18:04.812 --> 18:05.646
<i>Please.</i>

18:07.314 --> 18:08.106
Okay.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.359
Fuckin' idiot.

18:32.256 --> 18:35.384
11:03 PM

19:12.629 --> 19:13.755

20:02.804 --> 20:04.681
What're you doing out here, boy?

20:32.459 --> 20:34.378
C'mon, let's get you home.

20:38.131 --> 20:40.175
C'mon, Mercy. Please.

20:40.175 --> 20:41.385
Mercy!

20:52.437 --> 20:54.064
Mrs. Adler?

21:14.376 --> 21:15.711
Mrs. Adler?

21:45.407 --> 21:46.950
Mrs. Adler?

22:01.131 --> 22:02.674
Help me.

22:53.058 --> 22:55.018
Get in the truck! Right now!

22:55.560 --> 22:57.312
Move!

23:08.365 --> 23:09.449
What are we doin', Joel?

23:25.841 --> 23:28.135
- You killed her.
- Baby, I'm sorry.

23:28.135 --> 23:30.053
- Joel, we gotta go.
- Sarah, listen to me.

23:30.053 --> 23:31.763
It's not just the Adlers.

23:31.763 --> 23:34.349
But we're gonna be brave,
and we're gonna get outta this.

23:35.350 --> 23:37.144
Hey. Let's go. Come on.

23:37.936 --> 23:39.062
Get in.

23:40.772 --> 23:42.190
Joel?

23:42.190 --> 23:44.025
Denise, you get back inside the house!

23:44.025 --> 23:47.237
- You lock your doors! Now!
- C'mon, c'mon, get in!

23:56.329 --> 23:57.831
- Get your seat belt on.
- Hold on.

24:01.877 --> 24:03.753
Jesus Christ, Joel!

24:07.799 --> 24:09.885
- You take 70--
- 71, I know.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.553
AUSTIN
SAN MARCOS

24:11.553 --> 24:13.013
HOSPITAL

24:18.894 --> 24:19.853
- Daddy--
- We don't know.

24:19.853 --> 24:22.439
They're saying it's a virus.
Some kind of parasite.

24:22.439 --> 24:24.065
Is it from terrorists?

24:24.065 --> 24:26.359
We don't know.

24:26.818 --> 24:28.862
- Are we sick?
- No. Of course not.

24:28.862 --> 24:30.322
Why did things blow up?

24:30.322 --> 24:32.616
No cellphone, no radio.

24:32.616 --> 24:34.034
Minute ago, newsman wouldn't shut up.

24:34.034 --> 24:36.036
- How do you know?
- What?

24:36.036 --> 24:38.288
How do you know we're not sick?

24:38.288 --> 24:40.916
They're saying it's mostly
people in the city.

24:40.916 --> 24:42.918
That's why they got
the highway blocked off.

24:46.463 --> 24:47.380
God.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.716
It's Jimmy's place.

24:58.850 --> 25:01.228
The Adlers would take Nana into the city.

25:01.228 --> 25:02.896
To the hospital for stuff.

25:02.896 --> 25:05.899
That's right. They would.
That's probably why.

25:08.401 --> 25:12.197
But, you'd have to go a lot, right?

25:12.197 --> 25:13.615
We're fine. Trust me.

25:17.535 --> 25:19.079
All right.

25:24.209 --> 25:25.794
Here! Right here!

25:25.794 --> 25:27.545
- Hey!
- What are you doin'?

25:27.545 --> 25:30.215
- Got a kid, Joel.
- So do we. Keep driving.

25:30.215 --> 25:32.801
We could put them in the back.

25:35.679 --> 25:37.597
Somebody else'll come along.

25:48.149 --> 25:50.443
Fuck! Everybody had the same fuckin' idea.

25:51.903 --> 25:52.779
I can't get through this.

25:52.779 --> 25:54.614
All right. Let's think it through,
we'll think it through.

25:54.614 --> 25:56.157
- Fuck!
- All right, take the field.

25:56.157 --> 25:58.034
We cut across
and we pick up on the west side.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.828
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
West, west, all right.

25:59.828 --> 26:01.037
All right, hang on.

26:14.467 --> 26:16.761
Shit! Fuckin' army.

26:16.761 --> 26:18.596
- Isn't that good?
- It's good for them,

26:18.596 --> 26:20.640
but that's the highway
we're tryin' to get to.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.100
All right, keep movin'. Head north.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.810
- Could be a lotta people.
- Well, we can't go south,

26:23.810 --> 26:25.562
we can't go east, we can't go west.

26:25.562 --> 26:27.564
Hell else we supposed to go?

26:28.273 --> 26:29.190
Tommy, come on!

26:34.571 --> 26:35.488
Yeah.

26:36.364 --> 26:37.407
Yeah, I know that place.

26:37.407 --> 26:38.783
- This can work.
- Yeah, but then what?

26:38.783 --> 26:41.578
I don't know. Mexico.
Just far, far as we can.

26:41.578 --> 26:44.706
- How much gas?
- Three-quarter tank.

26:44.706 --> 26:47.292
Go through town, golf course by the river,
straight across,

26:47.292 --> 26:49.127
we pick up the highway
on the other side of the blockade,

26:50.295 --> 26:51.421
then we're out.

26:59.679 --> 27:01.222
Maybe it's everywhere.

27:03.308 --> 27:05.060
Maybe there's nowhere to go.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.608
What the fuck?!

27:24.245 --> 27:26.414
Son of a bitch. Gotta go around.

27:26.414 --> 27:27.624
Grab somethin'!

27:43.098 --> 27:44.808
All right, keep goin', keep goin'.

27:44.808 --> 27:46.393
Shit. Tommy!

27:50.271 --> 27:51.981
Tommy, you can't stop here.

27:51.981 --> 27:53.525
- I can't drive through 'em all.
- Are you serious?

27:53.525 --> 27:55.276
Just keep goin'!

28:00.073 --> 28:01.449
Go, go, go. Back, back, back,

28:01.449 --> 28:03.076
- back, back, back, back!
- I'm trying!

28:07.997 --> 28:09.374
Tommy, go faster!
We gotta go!

28:09.374 --> 28:10.667
I'm tryin'!
There's nowhere to fuckin' go!

28:10.667 --> 28:12.168
- Find an alley!
- What alley?

28:12.168 --> 28:13.711
- There's people everywhere!
- Roll the fuck over them!

28:13.711 --> 28:15.213
We gotta get off this street now!

28:15.213 --> 28:16.673
That's what I'm tryin' to do, Joel.

28:16.673 --> 28:18.425
We're gonna be okay. Just keep drivin'.

28:18.425 --> 28:19.426
Dad?

28:20.593 --> 28:21.928
Holy shit!

28:22.637 --> 28:24.722
Move. Move!

28:57.046 --> 28:59.132
Sarah, Sarah.

28:59.132 --> 29:00.758
Stay right there. Don't move.

29:01.885 --> 29:03.470
Tommy, you okay?

29:03.470 --> 29:05.054
Yeah, I'm okay.

29:18.485 --> 29:20.695
Sarah, don't look.

29:20.695 --> 29:22.614
You look at me, okay?

29:22.614 --> 29:24.532
I'm sorry, baby, I know, I know.

29:24.532 --> 29:25.867
Come here.
Put your arms around me.

29:25.867 --> 29:27.285
Come here, come here.

29:28.036 --> 29:30.371
I got you. I got you.

29:30.747 --> 29:31.873
Got you.

29:34.125 --> 29:36.336
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

29:36.336 --> 29:38.004
- My ankle.
- All right, okay.

29:38.004 --> 29:40.048
We gotta get off the street!
Shit!

29:44.636 --> 29:45.428
Tommy?!

29:46.262 --> 29:47.597
Tommy?

29:48.139 --> 29:49.057
Tommy!

29:50.934 --> 29:53.019
Head to the river! I'll find a way.

29:53.853 --> 29:55.480
Get her outta here, Joel! Go!

29:57.106 --> 29:58.483
- We can't leave him.
- He'll be fine.

29:58.483 --> 30:00.109
- Can you run?
- No.

30:01.444 --> 30:02.820
- You keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

30:02.820 --> 30:03.780
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.365
And don't look anywhere else.

30:05.865 --> 30:06.658
Alright.

31:05.133 --> 31:07.719
It's okay, baby. You're safe.

31:07.719 --> 31:09.554
Don't move!

31:10.722 --> 31:13.891
- My daughter's hurt. Her ankle.
- Stop right there!

31:14.684 --> 31:15.602
Okay.

31:16.644 --> 31:19.522
Easy now. We're not sick!

31:19.522 --> 31:22.275
I got two civilians by the river,
one of 'em injured.

31:23.776 --> 31:25.737
Ankle.

31:25.737 --> 31:27.614
What about Uncle Tommy?

31:27.614 --> 31:29.490
We're gonna get you somewhere safe first.

31:29.490 --> 31:30.742
Then we'll go back for him, okay?

31:30.742 --> 31:31.868
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:31.868 --> 31:33.661
I'm sorry, repeat?

31:33.661 --> 31:35.538
Hey! No one told you to move.

31:36.998 --> 31:38.249
Yes, sir.

31:39.876 --> 31:41.044
Yes, sir.

31:43.963 --> 31:45.298
Yes, sir.

31:49.636 --> 31:50.845
We're not sick.

31:53.473 --> 31:54.807
Sir,

31:55.475 --> 31:56.768
we are not sick!

32:10.156 --> 32:11.282
I'm sorry.

32:12.617 --> 32:13.451
Please, don't.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.004
Oh God.

32:30.134 --> 32:31.260
No. Oh no.

32:32.011 --> 32:33.971
No, no. No.

32:35.056 --> 32:37.392
Okay, You're okay.

32:37.392 --> 32:39.268
You're okay.
Move your hand, baby.

32:39.268 --> 32:40.436
Move your hand.

32:47.068 --> 32:48.945
I know, baby, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

32:48.945 --> 32:50.405
I know it hurts.

32:50.405 --> 32:53.658
Alright.
Don't look down, look up, look up.

32:53.658 --> 32:56.703

I know this hurts.

33:00.790 --> 33:02.125
You're gonna be okay.

33:02.125 --> 33:05.795
All right, baby, baby, baby, listen to me.

33:05.795 --> 33:09.424
I gotta get you up, okay?

C'mon.

41:02.021 --> 41:03.355
Or I could just shoot you.

41:03.355 --> 41:05.065
Yeah, but then what would you do?

41:07.109 --> 41:08.319
You're short five.

41:22.416 --> 41:25.711
NO ENTRY

41:28.964 --> 41:30.758
- Oxy?
- Hydro.

41:31.717 --> 41:33.177
- How old?
- Three months.

41:33.177 --> 41:34.970
- From Atlanta?
- I don't know where he gets 'em from.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.096
I just know they're real.

41:36.096 --> 41:37.556
If it's real, it's from Atlanta.

41:37.556 --> 41:39.934
FEDRA's got a factory
down there in the QZ.

41:39.934 --> 41:41.852
Supposedly only makes two things.

41:43.938 --> 41:45.981
Pills and bullets, bullets and pills.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.400
Well, the more you shoot people,
the harder it is to sleep, I guess.

41:49.610 --> 41:50.611
You guess?

41:51.779 --> 41:52.821
You want 'em or not?

41:58.452 --> 41:59.828
I need the bag back.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.418
- How we doin' with the vehicle?
- All set.

42:06.418 --> 42:08.337
Just had to get one last guy in the depot
to buy in.

42:08.921 --> 42:10.089
Okay, how much?

42:10.089 --> 42:12.716
Four of them on that shift plus me...

42:12.716 --> 42:13.676
six hundred total.

42:14.927 --> 42:17.471
Look, those trucks
are shitheaped for a reason.

42:17.471 --> 42:19.515
And they don't have any batteries. I know.

42:19.515 --> 42:21.976
I can see about 200 for the other guys...

42:21.976 --> 42:22.935
two hundred for you.

42:24.853 --> 42:26.105
Deal.

42:27.982 --> 42:29.400
Hey, do yourself a favor,

42:30.901 --> 42:32.403
stay off the streets
for the next few nights.

42:33.195 --> 42:35.781
Fuckin' Fireflies been
blowin' shit up all week.

42:35.781 --> 42:37.157
Two of our guys got shot this morning.

42:37.157 --> 42:39.159
Boss has got us working doubles.

42:39.159 --> 42:40.494
Guys are jumpy and tired.

42:41.996 --> 42:43.539
It's easy to make a mistake in the dark.

42:46.792 --> 42:47.918
Stay safe.

42:48.711 --> 42:49.753
Yeah, you too.

42:58.971 --> 43:03.309
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARKNESS
LOOK FOR THE LIGHT

43:11.025 --> 43:12.735
What do you want me to say, Tess?

43:13.569 --> 43:15.654
I'm not askin' you to say anything.

43:17.573 --> 43:18.574
Sure.

43:21.827 --> 43:25.914
It's not like I planned
on rippin' you off.

43:26.957 --> 43:28.083
I'm sorry.

43:29.293 --> 43:30.210
Well,

43:32.338 --> 43:34.214
how about we just let it go?

43:41.972 --> 43:43.932
What else are you gonna do?

43:43.932 --> 43:45.100
Ya gonna keep me here?

43:45.100 --> 43:47.561
- Kill me?
- Tess, c'mon.

43:47.561 --> 43:49.772
Then, Robert, what do ya want?

43:49.772 --> 43:51.231
I want you to forget this ever happened.

43:51.231 --> 43:52.649
Done.

43:52.649 --> 43:54.068
- Don't do that.
- What?

43:54.068 --> 43:56.654
It's just a truck battery.
I paid you for it,

43:56.654 --> 43:58.614
you sold it to someone else,
and you spent my money.

43:58.614 --> 44:00.282
I mean, you think I've
never done shit like that?

44:00.282 --> 44:02.743
- My guys fucked you up.
- Yeah, so discipline them.

44:02.743 --> 44:04.912
You cut off a finger
or whatever the fuck you want.

44:04.912 --> 44:07.414
I don't care. They're your fuckin' guys.

44:07.414 --> 44:10.125
What about your guy?
'Cause when he sees you,

44:10.125 --> 44:12.878
- I mean, put yourself in my shoes.
- Look, he answers to me.

44:14.004 --> 44:16.673
So, I give you my word
that he won't hurt you.

44:17.424 --> 44:21.220
I'll tell him that
I got jumped by some guys,

44:21.220 --> 44:24.223
and then you and I
can just move the fuck on.

44:26.725 --> 44:30.104
Now your shit has pretty much
ruined my week,

44:30.104 --> 44:34.233
and I'd like to go home
and drink 'til my face stops hurting.

44:34.233 --> 44:35.859
So, are we good?

44:41.740 --> 44:42.574
Yeah.

44:56.588 --> 44:58.298
<i>All citizens must clear</i>

44:58.298 --> 45:00.676

45:42.050 --> 45:45.095

45:45.095 --> 45:46.263
Oh shit.

45:47.556 --> 45:49.141
Firefly, up top!

45:50.100 --> 45:51.685
Free Boston now, motherfuckers!

46:03.655 --> 46:05.616
- They're shooting. They're shooting at us.
- On your knees.

46:05.616 --> 46:07.576
- On your knees!
- No, no! I'm not a F--

46:11.538 --> 46:13.790
I'm not a Firefly!

46:44.655 --> 46:46.240
Count slowly and clearly from one to 10.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.158
- One, two, three, four--
- Slowly,

46:48.158 --> 46:49.368
and clearly.

46:50.994 --> 46:51.787
One.

46:52.704 --> 46:53.497
Two.

46:54.206 --> 46:54.998
Three.

46:55.791 --> 46:56.583
Four.

46:57.251 --> 46:58.168
Five.

46:58.585 --> 46:59.962
Six.

46:59.962 --> 47:01.004
Seven.

47:01.672 --> 47:02.798
Eight.

47:02.798 --> 47:04.174
Fuck...

47:04.174 --> 47:05.425
you.

47:07.719 --> 47:08.762
And hold out your--

47:10.806 --> 47:13.141
- State your name, slowly and clearly.
- Veronica.

47:13.976 --> 47:17.271
Same as yesterday, and the day before,

47:17.271 --> 47:18.981
and the day before, and the--

47:19.856 --> 47:21.775
Hey, people are gonna come looking for me.

47:21.775 --> 47:23.485
People from FEDRA. You hear me?

47:23.485 --> 47:25.821
Let me out or you're gonna pay,
motherfuckers!

47:28.240 --> 47:30.492
I'm not supposed to be here!

47:37.416 --> 47:40.919
WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARKNESS

48:04.693 --> 48:06.278
Hey, there's a line!

48:06.278 --> 48:08.030
"Tell Dad it's a girl.

48:08.697 --> 48:10.866
"That would be good, right?

48:10.866 --> 48:13.076
"He wanted a granddaughter.

48:13.076 --> 48:14.953
Love, Becca."

48:14.953 --> 48:16.496
End message. Read back.

48:21.251 --> 48:23.462
Correct, 73-K Orlando. Out.

48:42.397 --> 48:43.440
Nothin'?

48:45.692 --> 48:47.277
Is there any chance
it's comin' in at night?

48:47.277 --> 48:48.945
You're sleepin', you miss it?

48:54.034 --> 48:56.870
When I'm sleeping, Gabriela listens,
or my son.

48:56.870 --> 48:59.039
The smart one, not the other one,
God bless him.

49:00.791 --> 49:02.417
If Tommy responded, we'd know.

49:03.126 --> 49:05.087
- And you're talkin' to the tower?
- Every day.

49:05.087 --> 49:06.838
They gave him your message,
they haven't seen or heard

49:06.838 --> 49:08.382
from him since, and that's it.

49:09.716 --> 49:12.302
- It hasn't been that long.
- It's been three weeks.

49:12.302 --> 49:14.054
It's never taken him
more than a day to respond.

49:16.139 --> 49:17.224
I'm sure he's okay.

49:23.355 --> 49:24.398
Show me where the tower is.

49:26.024 --> 49:27.150
You can't be serious.

49:29.027 --> 49:30.821
Joel, it's in Wyoming.

49:32.114 --> 49:33.907
All this open country?

49:33.907 --> 49:35.826
I mean, you're a capable guy,

49:35.826 --> 49:38.286
but there are worse things
than Infected out there.

49:38.286 --> 49:40.122
I hear everything on this.

49:40.122 --> 49:42.082
There are raiders, there are slavers--

49:42.082 --> 49:44.126
But you're "sure" Tommy's okay?

49:51.425 --> 49:53.719
It's the Cody tower...

49:55.178 --> 49:57.639
Q-Bar 4, but I don't know exactly wh--

50:04.020 --> 50:05.021
Next!

51:47.624 --> 51:49.125
<i>You know what, Joel...</i>

51:50.710 --> 51:51.586
<i>Joel!</i>

52:49.686 --> 52:51.771
I got jumped by a couple guys.

52:52.355 --> 52:54.482
- What guys?
- Just a couple teenagers.

52:54.482 --> 52:56.359
Said some shit, probably shouldn't've.

52:58.528 --> 53:00.906
Come on. You know these guys
were born after the outbreak.

53:00.906 --> 53:03.325
Never learned how to argue.
They just start swingin'.

53:03.325 --> 53:05.243
Fuckin' 19-year-old pieces of shit.

53:06.661 --> 53:07.871
It's a miracle you're alive.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.874
It's a miracle any of us are alive.

53:13.376 --> 53:14.669
These aren't new.

53:15.295 --> 53:16.087
No.

53:17.172 --> 53:19.799
I was in FEDRA lockup all day.

53:21.217 --> 53:22.218
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

53:23.845 --> 53:25.931
- I need you to take a breath.
- What?

53:28.642 --> 53:29.726
- Joel--
- What?

53:31.853 --> 53:33.813
The guys who jumped me were with Robert.

53:34.397 --> 53:36.274
He sold our battery to someone else.

53:37.734 --> 53:41.112
Nothing's lost.
Shit like this is gonna happen.

53:41.112 --> 53:42.739
Now we just shake it off,

53:42.739 --> 53:45.241
and we go get our cards back,
or the battery.

53:45.241 --> 53:46.868
I need the battery, Tess.

53:47.535 --> 53:49.079
Truck's no good without one,

53:49.079 --> 53:51.206
and if I don't get to Tommy soon,
he's gonna die out there.

53:51.206 --> 53:52.165
Okay, fuck it.

53:52.165 --> 53:54.125
We get our money back
and the battery.

53:54.125 --> 53:55.210
But, Joel, listen,

53:55.210 --> 53:57.337
Robert is terrified of you.

53:57.337 --> 53:59.172
So, you march outta here
all Clint Eastwood,

53:59.172 --> 54:01.007
he's gonna get wind of it and skip.

54:01.007 --> 54:03.301
I need you to take a breath.

54:09.099 --> 54:10.809
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Don't know.

54:10.809 --> 54:13.061
- Well, where is he?
- Don't know.

54:13.812 --> 54:14.688
Yet.

54:15.647 --> 54:18.400
But we're gonna find out, quietly.

54:18.858 --> 54:20.151
Understand?

54:21.611 --> 54:23.697
Now I promised Robert
that you wouldn't hurt him.

54:25.031 --> 54:28.159
But I would very much
like for you to hurt him.

54:28.159 --> 54:31.204
So let's go hunt that motherfucker down,

54:31.204 --> 54:33.915
and get our battery and our truck,

54:33.915 --> 54:35.917
and then we'll go find Tommy.

54:36.376 --> 54:37.168
All right?

54:40.338 --> 54:41.256
All right.

55:05.030 --> 55:06.531
The team in place at Southeast 3?

55:08.199 --> 55:09.284
I held them back.

55:10.493 --> 55:12.203
I have some questions.

55:12.912 --> 55:13.705
Okay.

55:15.290 --> 55:17.333
We've been blowing up
meaningless FEDRA targets

55:17.333 --> 55:19.711
spread out all over the QZ, for two weeks.

55:19.711 --> 55:21.755
We've already lost four people,
and we're--

55:23.006 --> 55:24.007
What's the point of this?

55:25.675 --> 55:27.343
Is that your question?

55:27.343 --> 55:29.095
That's one of them.

55:29.095 --> 55:30.597
My answer is to follow fuckin' orders.

55:31.473 --> 55:33.349
And why do you have some random girl
locked in a room?

55:33.349 --> 55:36.144
And the guys you have guarding her
won't tell me shit?

55:36.144 --> 55:39.773
Our people are asking what's going on,
and I don't know what to tell them.

55:39.773 --> 55:42.150
Tell them to follow fuckin' orders.

55:42.150 --> 55:44.360
You two, go to Southeast 3. Now.

55:50.617 --> 55:52.452
- Kim.
- Marlene.

55:52.452 --> 55:55.121
We are in a war
against a military dictatorship

55:55.121 --> 55:56.998
to restore democracy and freedom.

55:56.998 --> 55:57.999
Does that sound about right?

55:57.999 --> 55:59.084
- Yes?
- Are we winning?

55:59.084 --> 56:00.293
Are we beating FEDRA here?

56:00.293 --> 56:01.878
Are the Fireflies beating FEDRA anywhere?

56:01.878 --> 56:04.047
- Rebellion takes time.
- You fight for 20 years

56:04.047 --> 56:05.507
and you get nowhere,
you're not a rebellion.

56:06.049 --> 56:07.759
Just spray paint.

56:08.843 --> 56:11.304
We're not hitting FEDRA "all over" the QZ.

56:11.304 --> 56:14.891
We hit 'em here, here, here, here, here.

56:15.809 --> 56:16.810
Where are we right now?

56:18.895 --> 56:21.272
I want FEDRA everywhere but here.

56:21.272 --> 56:24.025
I want them as distracted as possible
because tonight,

56:24.025 --> 56:26.528
every Firefly in Boston
is gonna gather in this building,

56:26.528 --> 56:28.780
and we are gonna leave the QZ. Permanently.

56:30.115 --> 56:31.783
- We're quitting?
- No.

56:31.783 --> 56:34.869
We're taking that random girl
locked in that room west.

56:36.871 --> 56:38.957
From our guy in the radio tower in Salem.

56:47.757 --> 56:49.050
Is this real?

56:49.926 --> 56:51.469
I believe it is.

56:54.973 --> 56:56.141
Keep it quiet.

56:59.435 --> 57:01.229
Whatever you need.

57:01.229 --> 57:02.689
Whatever it takes.

57:02.689 --> 57:04.691
We'll get her where she needs to go.

57:34.095 --> 57:34.929
Hey, friend.

57:36.931 --> 57:38.349
Don't worry. I don't want anything.

57:39.142 --> 57:40.727
But if you're feelin' lost--

57:40.727 --> 57:43.354
You tell me to "look for the light"
and I'll break your jaw.

57:54.032 --> 57:57.577
Well, it cost us a couple of cards,
but we got him.

57:58.119 --> 58:01.289
He's supposedly takin' the battery
to a red-tagged building.

58:01.289 --> 58:04.500
But get this,
corner of Stillman and Cross.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.252
The one Miguel used to use.

58:06.252 --> 58:08.004
Yeah, I'm thinkin' so.

58:08.004 --> 58:10.089
We can take the subway tunnel
under Haymarket,

58:10.089 --> 58:13.218
get into the building from below,
and take Robert by surprise.

58:13.843 --> 58:15.136
Pay this fucker back.

58:23.561 --> 58:24.437
Oh, my God.

58:30.026 --> 58:31.861
Agh! You fucker!

58:38.201 --> 58:40.745
One, two, three, four--

59:08.856 --> 59:09.941
You're not scared.

59:13.152 --> 59:14.862
Then unlock me.

59:14.862 --> 59:16.489
How about we start with "thank you"?

59:16.489 --> 59:17.824
For what?

59:17.824 --> 59:19.575
For saving your life?

59:19.575 --> 59:21.077
I am the one who told 'em
not to shoot you,

59:21.077 --> 59:23.079
- if you recall.
- Yeah.

59:30.461 --> 59:31.462
Why did you stop them?

59:32.797 --> 59:33.923
We'll get to that.

59:48.146 --> 59:50.315
So, Veronica,

59:52.734 --> 59:54.068
how ya feelin'?

59:55.820 --> 59:56.946
The same.

59:59.032 --> 1:00:00.575
Is it gonna happen?

1:00:02.827 --> 1:00:03.745
No.

1:00:07.123 --> 1:00:08.124
So, can I go?

1:00:09.250 --> 1:00:10.251
No.

1:00:10.251 --> 1:00:12.128
I won't tell anyone about any of this.

1:00:12.128 --> 1:00:13.338
I swear.

1:00:13.338 --> 1:00:14.505
Where you gonna go?

1:00:14.505 --> 1:00:16.257
Back to FEDRA military school?

1:00:16.257 --> 1:00:19.469
- You that anxious to be a soldier?
- You think I chose that place?

1:00:19.469 --> 1:00:21.304
They put me there when I was a baby.

1:00:21.304 --> 1:00:22.597
It's for orphans.

1:00:22.597 --> 1:00:24.474
"They" didn't put you there.

1:00:26.434 --> 1:00:27.560
I did.

1:00:28.394 --> 1:00:29.520
Ellie.

1:00:33.358 --> 1:00:34.859
You my fucking mom or something?

1:00:35.568 --> 1:00:37.445
Do I look like your mom?

1:00:38.071 --> 1:00:40.198
Nooo, you do not.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:42.909
My name is Marlene.

1:00:42.909 --> 1:00:45.453
I'm the leader of the Fireflies
in the Boston QZ.

1:00:46.704 --> 1:00:48.498
Why would a terrorist dump me with FEDRA?

1:00:48.498 --> 1:00:50.666
Because it's where you'd be safest,
and you were safe there

1:00:50.666 --> 1:00:51.918
until you decided to sneak out.

1:00:51.918 --> 1:00:53.544
And "terrorist"?

1:00:54.379 --> 1:00:55.713
Was Riley a terrorist?

1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:14.565
Why won't you let me go home?

1:01:18.236 --> 1:01:21.406
Because you have a greater purpose
than any of us could've ever imagined.

1:01:22.657 --> 1:01:26.077
So we're leaving tonight,
and we're taking you with us.

1:01:28.788 --> 1:01:30.915
- He's here.
- Five minutes.

1:01:35.378 --> 1:01:37.797
What I'm about to tell you
cannot be repeated to anyone.

1:01:38.589 --> 1:01:41.759
Because if you do, I assure you

1:01:43.428 --> 1:01:44.971
you will die.

1:01:47.723 --> 1:01:50.268
HAYMARKET ACCESS 838

1:02:07.368 --> 1:02:08.369
Okay.

1:02:09.454 --> 1:02:10.371
Ready?

1:02:10.872 --> 1:02:11.789
Yeah.

1:02:29.348 --> 1:02:30.516
That's the one.

1:02:55.374 --> 1:02:56.626
Oh fuck.

1:02:56.626 --> 1:02:57.919
Oh shit.

1:02:59.962 --> 1:03:01.088
This one's done.

1:03:03.591 --> 1:03:04.509
Yeah.

1:03:05.343 --> 1:03:06.511
I know. I just--

1:03:06.511 --> 1:03:08.095
I wasn't expecting it.

1:03:08.095 --> 1:03:09.805
Take it he wasn't down here last time?

1:03:11.015 --> 1:03:11.933
No.

1:03:14.602 --> 1:03:16.395
You think he came down
after he was infected?

1:03:18.648 --> 1:03:21.234
Well, maybe down here
is where he was infected.

1:03:25.863 --> 1:03:27.406
Let's keep movin'.

1:03:41.546 --> 1:03:43.965
It's like they reframed
the whole structure.

1:03:43.965 --> 1:03:45.466
Probably in the '80s.

1:03:45.466 --> 1:03:47.343
Everyone was cutting down
on apartment sizes

1:03:47.343 --> 1:03:48.511
to sell more condos.

1:03:49.303 --> 1:03:53.891
"This has been 'Construction Corner'
with Joel Miller."

1:03:53.891 --> 1:03:55.184
How far up we goin'?

1:03:57.853 --> 1:03:59.021
This far.

1:04:01.857 --> 1:04:05.778
So, this opens into the hallway.

1:04:06.696 --> 1:04:09.615
What the fuck?
Someone put a piano in front of this?

1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:13.995
You smell that?

1:04:15.871 --> 1:04:17.999
Yeah, gunpowder.

1:04:24.547 --> 1:04:25.840
Tess.

1:04:46.777 --> 1:04:48.195
Well, the battery's no good.

1:04:49.071 --> 1:04:50.990
And he still tried to sell it.

1:04:51.824 --> 1:04:52.950
Twice.

1:04:53.993 --> 1:04:55.620
You greedy fuck.

1:05:09.759 --> 1:05:10.885
Shit.

1:05:10.885 --> 1:05:12.470
Oh God.

1:05:15.431 --> 1:05:17.058
Shit, come on.

1:05:24.190 --> 1:05:25.274
Fuck.

1:05:27.902 --> 1:05:28.986
Joel?

1:05:30.196 --> 1:05:31.155
Marlene?

1:05:33.366 --> 1:05:35.284
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:05:37.828 --> 1:05:39.246
Ellie.

1:05:39.246 --> 1:05:40.456
Ellie!

1:05:42.792 --> 1:05:45.628
- Oh shit!
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

1:05:45.628 --> 1:05:47.672
And you can't be stupid like this.

1:05:49.173 --> 1:05:51.676
So this is who Robert
screwed us over with?

1:05:51.676 --> 1:05:53.636
The Che Guevara of Boston?

1:05:53.636 --> 1:05:55.137
War must be goin' pretty shitty

1:05:55.137 --> 1:05:57.014
for you to be buying
from scumbags like him.

1:05:57.014 --> 1:05:58.265
Yeah, it kinda has been.

1:05:58.265 --> 1:05:59.809
The merch was bad,

1:05:59.809 --> 1:06:01.560
and he obviously didn't take "fuck off"
for an answer.

1:06:01.560 --> 1:06:03.604
- Gimme my knife.
- What do you need a car battery for?

1:06:04.647 --> 1:06:06.190
- Don't.
- Not at her.

1:06:08.192 --> 1:06:09.527
Point it at me.

1:06:22.456 --> 1:06:25.126
And to answer your question,
I need it for a better reason than you do.

1:06:25.126 --> 1:06:27.002
No offense, but Tommy's just one man.

1:06:28.212 --> 1:06:31.173
- It's our business to know things.
-"To know things."

1:06:31.173 --> 1:06:33.509
You're the cause of it.
You turned my own brother against me.

1:06:33.509 --> 1:06:35.052
- Okay, Joel.
- That was a lot of gunfire.

1:06:35.052 --> 1:06:37.096
- FEDRA's gonna be on the way.
- I know.

1:06:42.268 --> 1:06:44.437
We were gonna move Ellie
outta the zone tonight.

1:06:44.437 --> 1:06:47.481
But we won't make it anywhere like this.
Not for a while anyway.

1:06:47.481 --> 1:06:50.901
So now I'm thinkin', you're gonna do it.

1:06:50.901 --> 1:06:51.986
- The hell we are.
- I'm not goin' with them!

1:06:51.986 --> 1:06:54.196
- Let me take her.
- Tess, we don't have time for this.

1:06:54.196 --> 1:06:55.406
You don't have time?

1:06:55.406 --> 1:06:56.657
- Who is she?
- To you? She's cargo.

1:06:56.657 --> 1:06:58.159
We don't smuggle people. Sorry.

1:06:58.159 --> 1:06:59.452
- I can do it.
- Kim, you don't have

1:06:59.452 --> 1:07:00.953
a fuckin' ear on your fuckin' head.

1:07:00.953 --> 1:07:01.829
Could you please?

1:07:03.414 --> 1:07:06.250
There's a team of Fireflies
waiting for her at the old State House.

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:08.043
I know what's out there.

1:07:08.043 --> 1:07:11.130
We were going with an entire squadron
for that very reason.

1:07:11.130 --> 1:07:12.882
But now I don't have a truck,
I don't have a squadron,

1:07:12.882 --> 1:07:14.216
FEDRA's five minutes away.

1:07:14.216 --> 1:07:16.218
What I do have is you.

1:07:16.218 --> 1:07:18.929
And I know what you're both capable of.

1:07:18.929 --> 1:07:20.431
For better or worse.

1:07:23.350 --> 1:07:24.935
What are they capable of?

1:07:24.935 --> 1:07:27.772
You get her there safely,
and they'll give you what you need.

1:07:27.772 --> 1:07:29.732
Not just a battery. The whole thing.

1:07:29.732 --> 1:07:32.485
Fueled-up truck, guns,
supplies, all of it.

1:07:32.485 --> 1:07:33.819
I swear.

1:07:36.655 --> 1:07:37.990
I swear.

1:07:45.748 --> 1:07:46.791
Asshole!

1:07:52.838 --> 1:07:54.423
You trust her?

1:07:54.423 --> 1:07:56.425
No, me neither, but she seems desperate.

1:07:56.425 --> 1:07:59.094
Firefly vehicle usually means
repurposed FEDRA stuff.

1:07:59.094 --> 1:08:01.555
So better-than-decent chance
makin' it to Tommy in one of those.

1:08:01.555 --> 1:08:03.140
The second we hand that kid over--

1:08:03.140 --> 1:08:06.143
Y'all talk it through,
but please remember that I'm bleeding out.

1:08:10.231 --> 1:08:11.649
Okay. Here's the deal.

1:08:12.608 --> 1:08:14.568
We'll get her to your crew
at the State House.

1:08:14.568 --> 1:08:18.030
But before we hand her over,
they give us everything that we want.

1:08:18.030 --> 1:08:19.990
If not, we kill her, there and then.

1:08:19.990 --> 1:08:22.117
- Deal.
- Really? That fast?

1:08:22.117 --> 1:08:23.869
You are all that matters.

1:08:23.869 --> 1:08:25.746
My team will not jeopardize that.

1:08:25.746 --> 1:08:27.373
Remember what I told you?

1:08:27.373 --> 1:08:28.374
Now go get your backpack.

1:08:30.042 --> 1:08:31.460
Now, Ellie.

1:08:41.929 --> 1:08:43.055
Let's go.

1:08:51.021 --> 1:08:52.356
Joel,

1:08:54.358 --> 1:08:55.901
don't fuck this up.

1:08:58.237 --> 1:08:59.363
Please.

1:09:50.623 --> 1:09:52.208
Give us a minute, all right?

1:09:52.208 --> 1:09:53.375
What the fuck?!

1:09:55.127 --> 1:09:56.670
So, what's the plan?

1:09:57.922 --> 1:09:59.381
There's not a lot of options.

1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:02.092
There's the short way or the long way.

1:10:02.092 --> 1:10:03.761
The short way is pretty much...

1:10:03.761 --> 1:10:05.346
That leaves the long way.

1:10:05.346 --> 1:10:07.348
Things look bad,
we'll come up with something.

1:10:07.348 --> 1:10:08.307
We'll have to drop,
head to Bill and Frank's.

1:10:08.307 --> 1:10:09.308
ROAD ATLAS

1:10:09.934 --> 1:10:12.269
Stock up on anything we may need.

1:10:17.858 --> 1:10:19.526
THE BILLBOARD BOOK
OF NUMBER 1 HITS

1:10:27.952 --> 1:10:31.038
We leave after dark. Stay with the kid.

1:10:32.206 --> 1:10:33.332
Wait. Why do I have to-- Tess.

1:10:33.332 --> 1:10:34.875
B/F

1:10:34.875 --> 1:10:36.335
60 - NOTHING IN

1:10:36.335 --> 1:10:37.670
70 - NEW STOCK

1:10:37.670 --> 1:10:38.963
80 - X

1:10:44.259 --> 1:10:45.427
So, who's Bill and Frank?

1:10:49.098 --> 1:10:51.100
The radio's a smuggling code, right?

1:10:51.100 --> 1:10:52.810
'60s song, they don't have anything new,

1:10:52.810 --> 1:10:54.228
'70s, they got new stuff.

1:10:54.228 --> 1:10:55.562
What's '80s?

1:11:02.528 --> 1:11:03.821
What are you doing?

1:11:03.821 --> 1:11:05.781
- Killin' time.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

1:11:05.781 --> 1:11:07.408
I'm sure you'll figure that out.

1:11:15.249 --> 1:11:16.792
Your watch is broken.

1:11:31.974 --> 1:11:33.600
You mumble in your sleep.

1:11:41.608 --> 1:11:44.111
I've never been on the other side
of the Wall.

1:11:45.154 --> 1:11:46.572
Look how dark it is.

1:11:53.704 --> 1:11:55.247
You guys go out there a lot?

1:11:56.457 --> 1:11:58.459
- I guess.
- When was the last time?

1:11:58.459 --> 1:12:00.169
Maybe a year. What's it matter?

1:12:00.169 --> 1:12:01.795
But you know where to go.

1:12:03.088 --> 1:12:04.631
So we're gonna be okay.

1:12:09.386 --> 1:12:10.304
Yeah.

1:12:17.686 --> 1:12:19.063
So what's the deal with you anyway?

1:12:19.063 --> 1:12:20.981
You some kinda
bigwig's daughter or somethin'?

1:12:23.275 --> 1:12:24.818
Something like that.

1:12:34.286 --> 1:12:35.788
The radio came on when you were sleeping.

1:12:36.413 --> 1:12:37.706
What?

1:12:37.706 --> 1:12:38.749
What was the song?

1:12:38.749 --> 1:12:39.875
He kept sayin', like,

1:12:39.875 --> 1:12:42.544
"Wake me up before you go-go"?

1:12:43.545 --> 1:12:44.546
Shit.

1:12:45.923 --> 1:12:46.715
Gotcha.

1:12:47.382 --> 1:12:49.510
'80s means trouble.

1:12:50.344 --> 1:12:52.096
Code broken.

1:12:54.932 --> 1:12:56.100
Listen--

1:13:01.814 --> 1:13:04.400
The spot under Lancaster looks good.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.360
- You got a jacket in your pack?
- Yeah.

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:08.612
Okay, get it. It's time to go.

1:13:20.874 --> 1:13:25.087
<i>...mandatory curfew
to fight infection and insurrection.</i>

1:13:28.090 --> 1:13:30.050
<i>Observe mandatory curfew</i>

1:13:30.050 --> 1:13:33.262
<i>to fight infection and insurrection.</i>

1:13:33.262 --> 1:13:36.306
WELCOME

1:14:21.977 --> 1:14:24.646
Holy shit. I'm actually outside.

1:14:24.646 --> 1:14:25.981
- Jesus Christ.
- Shit.

1:14:29.318 --> 1:14:32.905
Okay, we're gonna take the left edge
around the buffer zone.

1:14:32.905 --> 1:14:35.324
You stay close and you follow my lead.

1:14:35.824 --> 1:14:36.825
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

1:14:38.410 --> 1:14:39.536
Let's go.

1:16:10.669 --> 1:16:11.837
What the hell?

1:16:11.837 --> 1:16:13.297
Hey, hey! Don't, don't, don't move.

1:16:15.215 --> 1:16:16.049
Don't move!

1:16:22.431 --> 1:16:23.473
You gotta be shittin' me.

1:16:24.182 --> 1:16:26.143
- Okay, let's talk this out.
- Turn around.

1:16:26.143 --> 1:16:27.227
- Hold on--
- Get on your fuckin' knees.

1:16:27.227 --> 1:16:28.395
Get on your fuckin' knees!

1:16:28.395 --> 1:16:29.980
- Now hold on--
- What did I fuckin' tell you, man?

1:16:29.980 --> 1:16:31.732
I said stay the fuck home.

1:16:31.732 --> 1:16:33.567
Get on your knees!

1:16:33.567 --> 1:16:35.444
Just get on your knees,
just get on your knees.

1:16:35.444 --> 1:16:38.238
Listen, you let us do this run,

1:16:38.238 --> 1:16:39.781
we'll split the cards with you.

1:16:39.781 --> 1:16:41.074
- Will you?
- Yeah.

1:16:41.074 --> 1:16:42.159
I'm so blessed.

1:16:42.159 --> 1:16:43.869
Hands on your head. Eyes forward.

1:16:44.619 --> 1:16:45.829
Hands on your head!

1:16:49.458 --> 1:16:51.877
- Really, man?
- Yep. We're doin' this by the book.

1:16:53.128 --> 1:16:54.713
Jesus Christ.

1:16:54.713 --> 1:16:56.298
All right. What about three-quarters?

1:16:57.549 --> 1:16:59.092
Unauthorized exit.

1:16:59.092 --> 1:17:00.177
They'll hang you for that.

1:17:00.177 --> 1:17:01.845
Fine. Everythin' off of this run,

1:17:01.845 --> 1:17:04.306
- and half off on all of the pills.
- Half off?

1:17:04.306 --> 1:17:05.724
All off.

1:17:05.724 --> 1:17:08.727
Risk my job for half off.
Outta your fuckin' mind--

1:17:09.394 --> 1:17:10.562
Ellie, Ellie!

1:17:10.562 --> 1:17:12.647
- Ellie, what the--
- Fuckin' bitch!

1:17:12.647 --> 1:17:13.690
Fuck!

1:17:14.733 --> 1:17:15.942
Get out of the fuckin' way!

1:17:18.570 --> 1:17:19.488
We can fix this.

1:17:20.238 --> 1:17:21.156
Move.

1:17:25.285 --> 1:17:26.411
Move.

1:18:04.116 --> 1:18:05.784
No, no! No, I'm not sick!

1:18:05.784 --> 1:18:08.328
- Joel! Joel, Joel!
- I am not sick! I'm not sick!

1:18:08.328 --> 1:18:11.081
Look! Look! This is three weeks old.

1:18:11.081 --> 1:18:12.499
Nobody lasts more than a day!

1:18:12.499 --> 1:18:15.001
Does this look a day old to you?

1:18:15.001 --> 1:18:17.087
- You would've killed me!
- I should fucking kill you!

1:18:17.087 --> 1:18:20.257
- When did it happen?
- It doesn't matter! You have to trust me!

1:18:20.257 --> 1:18:22.217
They're gonna catch us if we don't run!

1:18:24.594 --> 1:18:27.889
Joel, we gotta move. We gotta move, Joel!

1:18:39.901 --> 1:18:41.027
Joel!

1:18:47.367 --> 1:18:51.496
