01:27.400 --> 01:33.191
Are you ready to give up your own
lives forever, for the spices?

01:33.280 --> 01:36.829
To never love anyone but the spices?

01:37.840 --> 01:40.638
I am, First Mother. I know the rules.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.315
Mistresses, I have taught you all I can.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.913
We must now decide where you are to go.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.918
<i>Paris.</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:57.353
<i>London.</i>

01:58.360 --> 01:59.713
<i>Nairobi.</i>

02:00.840 --> 02:02.478
Los Angeles.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.152
<i>Hong Kong.</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:05.753
<i>Toronto.</i>

02:05.840 --> 02:07.432
<i>San Francisco.</i>

02:08.320 --> 02:11.756
<i>There's a need for you in all these places.</i>

02:37.560 --> 02:39.869
You will not burn.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.235
<i>You will not feel pain.</i>

02:43.880 --> 02:49.193
You will wake up in your new home
free of all your own desires.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.313
But if a mistress fails her duty...

02:53.400 --> 02:56.278
the spices will punish her.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.077
<i>I love being a mistress of spices.</i>

04:31.240 --> 04:33.276
<i>The spices are my love.</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:39.310
<i>I know their origins, colors,</i>
<i>smells, their magic powers.</i>

04:39.400 --> 04:42.836
<i>Yes, the old, old magic.</i>

04:49.000 --> 04:51.639
<i>Every spice has a purpose.</i>

04:51.720 --> 04:55.952
<i>And for each person, there's a special spice.</i>

04:56.720 --> 04:58.676
<i>I am named Tilo...</i>

04:58.760 --> 05:01.069
<i>after the sesame seed...</i>

05:01.160 --> 05:04.038
<i>the spice of nourishment.</i>

05:04.120 --> 05:06.953
<i>But here no-one knows who I am.</i>

05:32.080 --> 05:33.593
Ladyjaan?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.238
Yes, Haroun?

05:35.320 --> 05:37.880
Ah! Ladyjaan.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.678
Ah, please!

05:40.840 --> 05:43.308
I am sick of old lady Kapadia.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.079
These rich Indians,
they think they're still in India.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.037
They treat us like animals.

05:49.120 --> 05:53.636
Do this, that. Drive me here, there.
Not even a nod of thanks.

05:53.720 --> 05:56.757
Ladyjaan, you must read my fortune today.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.869
Haroun...

05:58.960 --> 06:01.428
- you know I can't read your for...
- Yes, but Ahmed said.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.033
You helped him get a green card.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.511
He was nervous before the interview, so I just
gave him some brahmi leaves to chew on.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.434
<i>But he remembered</i>
<i>the Allegiance Pledge. First time, in English.</i>

06:11.520 --> 06:15.399
That wasn't me. It was the dashmul.
The herb of ten roots.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.074
Lady, you are just playing with me.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.392
Look at these eyes.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.675
You see these dark circles?

06:23.760 --> 06:27.389
<i>Poor Haroun,</i>
<i>who came for the American Dream.</i>

06:27.480 --> 06:30.233
<i>that now works for an Indian nightmare.</i>

06:30.320 --> 06:32.390
Lady...

06:32.480 --> 06:34.311
please.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.034
What's this?

06:39.120 --> 06:43.750
Oh, it's from tire irons and wrenches,
from Arco Garages, my first job.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.229
And erm... before that?

06:46.320 --> 06:48.117
Back in Kashmir we are boatmen.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.636
My grandfather, my father and I,
we would row our shikara for tourists,

06:51.720 --> 06:53.676
from America, Europe.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.874
<i>One year, money was so good,</i>
<i>we lined the seats with red silk.</i>

07:13.840 --> 07:20.313
<i>Chandan, the powder of the sandalwood</i>
<i>tree, that relieves the pain of remembering.</i>

07:29.120 --> 07:30.439
Rub it in.

07:31.560 --> 07:33.630
<i>One day the fighting started.</i>

07:34.720 --> 07:37.871
<i>The soldiers arrived</i>
<i>and the tourists stopped coming.</i>

07:37.960 --> 07:40.315
<i>The rebels came to take the young men.</i>

07:42.360 --> 07:43.759
<i>There was blood.</i>

07:43.840 --> 07:45.876
<i>Blood and more blood...</i>

07:45.960 --> 07:49.919
<i>redder than the red silk of the boat.</i>

07:51.000 --> 07:53.036
<i>I wish I had...</i>

07:53.120 --> 07:54.792
<i>Hurry, now.</i>

07:54.880 --> 07:57.030
<i>Faster, Haroun.</i>

07:57.120 --> 07:59.031
<i>I wish I, too, had...</i>

08:11.720 --> 08:13.950
What was I saying?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.792
You wanted to know your fortune.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.993
Oh, yes.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.792
- It is good.
- Mm-hm.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.233
Very good.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.437
Great things will happen in this new land for you.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.999
Um...

08:35.080 --> 08:38.595
riches and happiness...

08:39.679 --> 08:42.240
...and maybe even... love.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.072
Oh, Ladyjaan.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.559
Thank you.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.036
I know you have the gift.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.751
Thank you.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.989
I must go.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.278
<i>Poor Haroun.</i>

09:06.760 --> 09:08.955
<i>I, too, was taken from home.</i>

09:12.360 --> 09:17.912
<i>When I was born, my parents' faces</i>
<i>were heavy with fallen hope at another girl.</i>

09:18.000 --> 09:21.231
<i>A daughter meant nothing more</i>
<i>than a dowry debt.</i>

09:22.760 --> 09:26.435
<i>Maybe because I was left</i>
<i>to wander around alone.</i>

09:26.520 --> 09:30.752
<i>I discovered I could see things others could not.</i>

09:33.680 --> 09:37.355
<i>I knew which servant girl</i>
<i>was sleeping with her master.</i>

09:43.120 --> 09:47.272
<i>I told a wealthy landowner</i>
<i>where to find his lost ring.</i>

09:53.240 --> 09:56.755
<i>And I warned the village headman</i>
<i>of the floods before they came.</i>

10:01.960 --> 10:04.713
<i>My fame spread far and wide.</i>

10:06.040 --> 10:09.510
<i>And then the bandits came for me</i>
<i>to lead them to riches.</i>

10:37.000 --> 10:39.070
<i>Mummy! Papa!</i>

10:48.040 --> 10:50.918
Mummy! Papa!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.116
Mummy!

11:31.080 --> 11:35.596
<i>I did not know it,</i>
<i>but I had arrived at my destiny.</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:45.550
<i>First Mother said I had been brought</i>
<i>to her to fulfill my duty as a mistress of spices.</i>

11:45.640 --> 11:50.111
Don't you know it's very important that you know
what the names of these spices are?

11:50.200 --> 11:54.591
Because you will be using them in your work
and you will get the power from them.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.750
<i>Those are red chillies.</i>

11:56.840 --> 11:58.239
<i>Red chillies.</i>

11:58.320 --> 12:00.356
<i>Cardamom.</i>
<i>Cardamom.</i>

12:00.440 --> 12:02.829
<i> Do you listen to the spices?</i>

12:02.920 --> 12:08.836
<i>I was taught the power of the spices</i>
<i>and the consequences for breaking the rules.</i>

12:08.920 --> 12:12.469
First rule...
you are here to see to the other's desires,

12:12.560 --> 12:15.472
never to use the spices for your own.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.308
Cardamom.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.029
Second rule... you may never leave the store.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.795
So there is no danger
of your straying away from the spices.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.519
Is this turmeric?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.795
Give it to me! Give it to me!

12:41.880 --> 12:43.518
Ginger.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.037
Final rule... you may never touch another's skin.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.430
<i>Why are you warning me, chillies?</i>

13:30.040 --> 13:31.109
Sister...

13:31.200 --> 13:33.509
I was wondering if you could help me.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.239
I've seen you here from the salon.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.352
<i>Do you know how to do this?</i>
<i>My girlfriend says it's an Indian thing.</i>

13:41.920 --> 13:43.148
Mehndi.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.476
When are you getting married?

13:50.560 --> 13:52.755
What's that got to do with anything?

13:52.840 --> 13:54.558
Mehndi is normally done on brides.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.915
I was just hoping to wear it to a hair show.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.834
If I have to wait until I get married...
girl, I may never get a chance

14:02.240 --> 14:03.992
<i>Saffron, for lonely nights.</i>

14:04.080 --> 14:07.709
To glow, and attract love into your life.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.791
What is that?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.836
To give you energy for the long hours.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Myisha.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.235
I'll see you real soon, girl. Take care.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.639
See you.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.359
You're cooking for her again?

14:26.440 --> 14:28.908
She loved the coconut korma.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.118
<i>Nothing like its delicate flesh to bind new hearts.</i>

14:33.200 --> 14:35.668
- You ready for garlic now?
- I don't know about garlic.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.594
- You see, me and garlic...
- Some religious groups in India never eat it.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.875
That's what I'm talking about. That garlic...

14:41.960 --> 14:45.191
Because they fear its reputation
as an aphrodisiac.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.157
<i>You should try the eggplant bhurtha.</i>

14:51.720 --> 14:53.597
You grill the eggplant over a flame.

14:55.560 --> 15:00.680
Scoop the insides out
and then fry it with ten cloves of garlic,

15:00.760 --> 15:04.673
cumin seeds, little red onions and tomatoes.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.797
And you sprinkle it with coriander leaves.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.792
<i>To feed your passion through the night.</i>

15:10.880 --> 15:11.835
Cool.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.118
Listen, if you get all the ingredients together,
I'll pick it up when I come back from class.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.474
OK, then.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.755
Thanks a lot. See you later.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.400
<i>Jagjit, don't hang on me like a girl.</i>

15:22.480 --> 15:24.152
Go get me daal chini.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.268
Bag!

15:30.360 --> 15:34.956
Oh, Jagjit, the hairs on my head will turn white
before you learn to do anything.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.112
<i>Oh, what's the problem, Osama?</i>

15:49.160 --> 15:51.628
Towel head! Towel head!

16:03.040 --> 16:08.273
<i>Cinnamon, friend maker, warm,</i>
<i>brown as Jaggi's skin.</i>

16:08.360 --> 16:13.070
<i>to find you someone who will show you</i>
<i>this America is not so bad.</i>

16:14.360 --> 16:17.796
Jagjit, do you know what your name means?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.918
World conqueror.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.433
<i>Stupid boy.</i>

16:24.280 --> 16:25.838
Thank you.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.393
<i>Hey, buddy, you OK?</i>
<i>Hey, you got a phone, man?</i>

17:26.960 --> 17:29.554
- Hey, man. Are you all right? You OK?
<i>Bring him in.</i>

17:29.640 --> 17:31.312
I can help him.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.914
All right. He's OK. Let's go.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.796
Shall I call an ambulance?

17:42.880 --> 17:45.713
- It's nothing.
<i>I know what he needs.</i>

17:45.800 --> 17:47.438
I'll just be a minute.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.796
<i>I have to help him, chillies. He is hurt.</i>

18:26.400 --> 18:30.279
<i>Why did you send him away, spices?</i>
<i>He was no danger to me.</i>

18:36.040 --> 18:39.510
I don't know what happened, but the bike's fine.
I'd better go. Thanks.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.160
But... you are bleeding.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.355
Please.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.759
Sit down.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.197
Hold your arm out, please.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.158
This is very nice of you.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.879
Where did you learn this?

19:13.960 --> 19:16.554
I uh... grew up with it around me.

19:24.520 --> 19:27.557
It must have been passed down
for generations, huh?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.509
<i>Chilies, you can't be his spice.</i>

19:52.120 --> 19:53.758
Nice place you have here.

20:10.280 --> 20:11.679
What's wrong?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.232
You'd better go now.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.550
Well, thank you. It feels much better.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.435
I'd like to give you something for all your...

20:41.640 --> 20:43.198
Thanks again.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.911
You didn't need to do all this.

21:27.640 --> 21:31.792
<i>I should have listened to you, spices,</i>
<i>and sent him away.</i>

21:31.880 --> 21:34.792
<i>I thought he came to me for help.</i>

21:38.560 --> 21:42.758
<i>America, a new land no older than a heartbeat.</i>

21:43.800 --> 21:45.791
<i>There is so little I know about you.</i>

22:18.360 --> 22:21.796
<i>Ladyjaan, I quit my job with Kapadia memsahib.</i>

22:21.880 --> 22:23.472
<i>You quit?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

22:23.560 --> 22:26.632
Last night, I was at Fried Kentucky Chicken
on 14th Street...

22:26.720 --> 22:28.790
and someone grabs my shoulder.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.628
Now, I'm praying to Allah as I turn,
but it's only being Mujibar.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.716
Mujibar from my uncle's village!

22:36.800 --> 22:40.031
I didn't even know he was in America.
And he's done good, too.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.076
He's got a couple of taxis already...

22:43.160 --> 22:45.993
...and he's looking for a driver.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.197
Good pay, he's telling me.
Special for a fellow Kashmiri.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.316
And maybe even the chance to buy later on.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.719
Ladyjaan...

22:52.800 --> 22:55.155
there's nothing like being your own master.

22:56.920 --> 23:01.118
So, from tomorrow, I'm driving a cab,
black and yellow like a sunflower.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.793
<i>A cab?</i>

23:03.880 --> 23:05.518
<i>This is all your doings.</i>

23:07.240 --> 23:08.832
Thank you.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.037
Come and have a look at my taxi.
It's just outside. Come.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.235
Haroun...

23:14.320 --> 23:16.436
you know I cannot leave this store.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.556
The store will be fine without you for a minute.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.234
It's only a bus backfiring. Ladyjaan, come.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.878
Touch it for good luck, huh?

23:29.920 --> 23:31.751
<i>Ladyjaan?</i>

23:34.640 --> 23:36.676
<i>Are you OK?</i>

23:42.800 --> 23:44.597
How many times have I told you?

23:44.680 --> 23:49.754
You should put an ad in India West for a helper.
Running this big store by yourself, it's too much.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.115
Haroun, just be careful.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.439
What?

23:57.520 --> 24:00.114
Look. Please display for me.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.997
My number is on the back,
so you can call me any time.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.275
And I will give you a free ride to San Francisco.

24:06.360 --> 24:11.115
The beautiful Golden Gate Bridge,
Alcatraz Island, the wharf of the fisherman.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.872
I'll take you everywhere.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.556
<i>What does Haroun need?</i>

24:44.800 --> 24:48.349
<i>Kalo jire. Black cumin seeds.</i>

24:48.440 --> 24:51.159
<i>Protector against the evil eye.</i>

24:51.240 --> 24:53.310
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

24:57.080 --> 24:58.911
<i>Hello?</i>

24:59.000 --> 25:00.638
Hi, Dadaji.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.950
Chi, chi, chi.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.076
I need something for my mental peace.

25:05.960 --> 25:12.638
Ever since I came to this America,
I have not got one iota.

25:13.680 --> 25:18.959
And that Satish of mine,
"Come, Baba, come here," he said.

25:19.040 --> 25:23.750
"We are all here. Why do you want to be far
away from your flesh, blood

25:23.840 --> 25:25.592
and a younger granddaughter?"

25:25.680 --> 25:29.195
I'd rather not have anything
with this granddaughter at all.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.350
Dadaji, Geeta's such a nice girl.

25:31.440 --> 25:36.912
She's pretty, well-spoken,
and she loves my mango pickle.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.991
It's all right with these foreign girls.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.958
But you tell me one thing yourself.

25:42.040 --> 25:46.431
Is it all right to work late, late in the night,
in the office with men?

25:46.520 --> 25:49.830
And that also being dropped by these men
in their cars. You tell me!

25:50.720 --> 25:52.199
Who will want to marry her?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.834
Dadaji... this is America.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.957
And even in India, women are working.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.350
I know it is America. But we are Indians still, no?

26:02.440 --> 26:06.194
You would have not done something like that,
I know it!

26:07.720 --> 26:10.951
When oil and lighting um...

26:11.040 --> 26:14.157
- Match.
...match is put together, there's bound to be fire.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.990
And once the fire starts,
it is very difficult to put it out.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.628
I need something for my mental peace.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.791
I'll get you brahmi oil to cool your system.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.552
And one more thing.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.471
Yesterday she was wearing...

26:33.560 --> 26:36.472
- Where are you going looking like this?
- I'm going out.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.357
With so much of make-up?

26:38.440 --> 26:43.230
In our times, only English women and loose
ladies used to wear so much of make-up.

26:43.320 --> 26:48.394
And good Indian girl is not ashamed
of the face that God has given her.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.471
I'm not ashamed of anything.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.120
And why are you wearing something like this?

26:54.200 --> 26:56.350
You want every man to look at your chest?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.431
Gramps, don't wait up.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.235
But I...

27:10.840 --> 27:12.273
Feeling better?

27:12.360 --> 27:13.713
Thanks to you.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.268
Whatever you put under that bandage
worked wonders.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.192
It's almost all healed.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.840
I didn't get a chance to thank you properly
last time.

27:22.920 --> 27:28.233
I was going to have flowers delivered
and I realized I don't even know your name.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.437
I'm Doug.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.919
Tilo.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.474
I will come back for my peace of mind again.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.039
Chi, Dadaji.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.479
Take care, Dadaji.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.397
You take care, my dear.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.958
It smells so beautiful in here.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.039
I must have passed this store hundreds of times
and I've always been scared to come in.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.270
Scared? Why?

28:07.200 --> 28:10.237
I don't know. I wasn't sure if it was OK
for a guy like me to...

28:11.320 --> 28:13.072
Well, you know.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.355
It seems like it's for your community.

28:15.440 --> 28:18.273
No, it's... it's for everyone.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.189
Wow, there must be thousands of spices in here.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.272
How do you keep track of what they're all for?

28:28.360 --> 28:29.759
I can't even cook an egg.

28:29.840 --> 28:33.071
- Everyone has a spice.
- Really?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.390
I got a spice too?

28:38.360 --> 28:40.510
Well, which one's mine?

28:41.360 --> 28:45.194
Um... if you'll wait here a minute,
I'll just go find yours.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.556
<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

29:00.640 --> 29:02.596
<i>What does he need?</i>

29:02.680 --> 29:05.274
<i>Is it methi seed for strength?</i>

29:05.360 --> 29:07.635
<i>Ajwain for confidence?</i>

29:07.720 --> 29:09.915
<i>Fennel for perseverance?</i>

29:10.000 --> 29:12.195
<i>Why can't I see?</i>

29:12.280 --> 29:15.431
When you begin to weave your desires
into your vision,

29:15.520 --> 29:17.875
<i>the true seeing is taken from you.</i>

29:19.120 --> 29:23.432
<i>You grow confused</i>
<i>and the spices no longer obey.</i>

29:33.720 --> 29:37.269
<i>Asafoetida, the antidote to love.</i>

29:37.360 --> 29:39.191
<i>You can't be his spice.</i>

29:51.840 --> 29:53.796
These chillies look deadly.

29:53.880 --> 29:56.599
They are. You should stay away from them.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.878
What happened to my spice?

30:02.240 --> 30:06.358
It's not something bad, is it?
Some high-carb spice or something?

30:07.440 --> 30:10.352
It's um... It's a special one.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.032
Sorry.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.959
Hey.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.598
Yeah.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.069
<i>I'll be there, like, in like ten minutes.</i>

30:22.160 --> 30:23.479
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

30:23.560 --> 30:27.075
Sorry about that. It's just we've started
a new building down the street.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.832
There's lots of city politics.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.831
You are an architect?

30:30.920 --> 30:32.558
Yeah, but that's just my job.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.756
I got a spice now.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.433
What's my spice supposed to do for me,
anyway?

30:42.480 --> 30:45.233
It depends. What do you need?

30:46.440 --> 30:48.396
You think I need something?

30:49.520 --> 30:52.080
I'm all out of your spice.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.718
But...

31:12.720 --> 31:14.278
I um...

31:15.320 --> 31:17.072
I have something for you.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.198
What is it?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.430
It's... tulsi.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.033
Holy basil.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.871
Mm. What's it for?

31:28.920 --> 31:30.751
Drink it like tea.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.910
And that's on the house.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.070
You know, it's funny.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.311
People look at me
and think that I'm doing OK.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.437
But you look at me like you know something
you're not telling me.

31:45.480 --> 31:49.314
I only know that everyone's welcome here.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.356
There's no need to be scared.

31:53.560 --> 31:58.554
I still can't believe that you can remember what
all these spices are for without getting mixed up.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.079
It's simple.

32:02.120 --> 32:04.076
We all have spices.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.515
Just like we all have traditions.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.239
Yeah.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.909
Well... I'll drink this tonight.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.198
I'd better get back to work.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.673
Thanks.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.158
<i>Tulsi... for remembering.</i>

32:32.760 --> 32:34.398
Remember to come back.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.436
Don't Shake Me Up

33:42.160 --> 33:47.917
<i>It would be so easy just once</i>
<i>to use the spices for myself.</i>

33:48.880 --> 33:55.069
<i>Crushed prishniparni burned with lotus root in</i>
<i>the evening would make him come back to me.</i>

34:10.560 --> 34:13.472
<i>Tulsi... you were right.</i>

34:14.520 --> 34:16.476
<i>Why should he think of me?</i>

34:17.600 --> 34:19.591
<i>He's remembering someone else.</i>

34:48.000 --> 34:50.036
<i>Hello, Beti. You still here?</i>

34:50.120 --> 34:54.237
You still here? I've got a letter from
Janu Barwa, my old army friend.

34:54.320 --> 34:58.598
They are looking for a match
for his grandnephew.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.398
You gotta be joking!

35:00.480 --> 35:04.678
I mean, why would I leave my career, my family,
all my friends here

35:04.760 --> 35:07.320
to go some place I've visited, like, twice?

35:08.480 --> 35:11.631
I mean,
I don't even like going to the bathroom in India.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.510
Mom... Dad...

35:17.600 --> 35:19.909
I have met someone...

35:20.000 --> 35:21.956
and we're in love.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.278
No shame at all.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.756
Making talk of love.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.150
In front of me, her grandfather.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.071
Anthony Garcia?

35:34.160 --> 35:37.197
Satish, she is marrying a white man?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.157
He's not white. He's chicano.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.959
Chicano? What's that?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.598
I know it's nothing good.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.274
He's Mexican-American.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.751
You are losing your caste and putting
the blackest color on our ancestors' faces

35:50.840 --> 35:53.832
to marry a man whose people
are slum criminals and illegals?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.512
You don't understand, Grandpa.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.989
I understand! I understand everything!

35:58.080 --> 36:01.197
<i>Satish is sitting totally quiet.</i>

36:01.280 --> 36:03.316
I want to tell him.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.709
Once you let cow out of the barn...

36:07.760 --> 36:10.638
...you can't stop it
from trampling the paddy fields.

36:13.920 --> 36:16.275
But when I look at his face...

36:16.360 --> 36:18.271
I don't have the heart.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.195
I say, "Satish...

36:22.280 --> 36:24.635
put me on a plane tomorrow to India.
Tomorrow!"

36:25.480 --> 36:27.391
Dad?

36:29.000 --> 36:31.150
- Dad, say something.
- I trusted you.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.196
I don't want to see your face.

36:33.920 --> 36:35.876
How can you say that to me?

36:36.920 --> 36:38.239
<i>Fine.</i>

36:38.320 --> 36:40.436
Then I'm gonna move in with Tony!

36:40.520 --> 36:42.954
Because he's been asking me.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.828
All this time I've been saying no
because I've been thinking of you.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.433
But now I will.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.954
Then I'll just go ahead and marry him.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.270
Because that's what <i>we</i> want.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.590
I do not know what to do.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.110
So I came to you.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.471
I know you can help.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.193
Please.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.596
<i>Almond powder and kesar to boil in milk.</i>

37:28.680 --> 37:30.272
<i>The whole family must drink it.</i>

37:30.360 --> 37:34.672
<i>To sweeten your words</i>
<i>and remember the love buried under the anger.</i>

37:34.760 --> 37:36.193
Thank you.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.872
It's so late.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.548
I'll take a taxi home instead of bus.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.793
<i>Haroun.</i>

37:53.400 --> 37:55.960
<i>Please forgive me, spices.</i>

37:56.040 --> 37:57.553
I've been distracted.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.110
How could I forget the kalo jire
to shield Haroun from the evil eye?

38:19.960 --> 38:21.188
Hey.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.872
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.349
- I didn't mean to...
- It's nothing.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.271
Here, let me take a look.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.717
Here. Put some water on it.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.478
Clean it out.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.558
Is that better?

39:00.960 --> 39:02.837
Ladyjaan?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.998
What's going on?

39:07.080 --> 39:09.196
- Haroun...
- You should um...

39:09.280 --> 39:11.316
You should put something on that cut.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.198
Yes, I'll get a neem leaf.

39:22.840 --> 39:26.310
Please help him. It's OK, I'm in no hurry.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.438
You should be careful
who you let in your store after dark.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.076
There's all kinds of mad people roaming
around this neighborhood.

39:43.160 --> 39:45.116
How come your door wasn't locked today?

39:45.200 --> 39:48.510
Just last week a man broke
into the Sri Lankan 7-Eleven

39:48.600 --> 39:50.830
and shot the owner in the chest three times.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.992
Better you ask this fellow to leave
while I'm still being here.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.719
Haroun, I can look after myself very well.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.234
And it's best you do not insult my customers.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.753
I was...

40:03.840 --> 40:06.957
I was speaking out of concern like a brother.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.032
I see I stepped too far.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.672
I didn't mean it like that.

40:18.200 --> 40:24.753
What right have I, a poor... taxi driver...
to advise you... a lady?

40:24.840 --> 40:26.353
Haroun, please don't go.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.271
I'll have your package in a few minutes.

40:31.320 --> 40:32.958
Haroun, please!

40:46.440 --> 40:48.795
- I'm sorry about...
- It's OK.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.190
He uh... He seemed kind of pissed off, though.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.429
Is he? Are you and he?

40:55.520 --> 40:59.752
No, no, no, he's just a loyal customer.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.593
He needed some kalo jire for protection.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.596
How can you be so sure what he needs?

41:05.680 --> 41:07.193
I just know.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.318
Like you know what I need?

41:13.680 --> 41:15.750
Why did you give me that tea to drink?

41:18.160 --> 41:21.630
For clarity... at work.

41:21.720 --> 41:26.748
Well, ever since you gave it to me,
I've been having the most incredible dreams...

41:27.920 --> 41:31.435
...remembering all this stuff
that I'd completely forgotten about.

41:31.520 --> 41:35.798
I don't know how you do it, but you're incredible.

41:45.880 --> 41:47.313
<i>I'm sorry, spices.</i>

41:53.640 --> 41:55.232
Are you OK?

41:58.720 --> 42:01.553
<i>I must give him the asafoetida</i>
<i>and send him away for ever.</i>

42:01.640 --> 42:05.030
Um... I'm sorry...

42:07.480 --> 42:09.675
It's... It's very late.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.910
I hope I haven't offended you.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.709
Just I... I just... I just wanted to thank you.

42:17.440 --> 42:22.036
Maybe I can buy you some dinner sometime
and we can go somewhere nice.

42:23.280 --> 42:26.750
- I can't leave the store.
- I mean when you're not busy with the store.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.479
You must get a day off sometime.

42:29.560 --> 42:31.755
I could pick you up on my bike and...

42:33.200 --> 42:35.111
What's your favorite food?

42:35.200 --> 42:38.670
Sushi, Italian.
I know a great little place in Chinatown.

42:38.760 --> 42:40.796
- It has the most...
- I can't leave the store.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.030
Are you married? Have you got a boyfriend?

42:45.120 --> 42:46.792
No! No.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.110
I guess your family wouldn't approve, huh?

42:49.200 --> 42:50.918
Are they real traditional?

42:51.960 --> 42:53.916
I've broken too many rules already.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.916
I think you should leave.

43:17.880 --> 43:21.475
<i>I'm sorry, I never gave you your true spice.</i>

43:56.920 --> 44:01.516
<i>Please... do not leave me... spices.</i>

44:01.600 --> 44:03.750
<i>You must speak to me again.</i>

44:26.560 --> 44:30.075
<i>My spices, I knew you wouldn't abandon me.</i>

44:30.160 --> 44:31.878
Garlic never fails.

44:31.960 --> 44:34.235
<i>It is known as the wonder food back home.</i>

44:34.320 --> 44:36.550
You know, I have the perfect thing for you today.

44:40.560 --> 44:44.712
Paan... a must at the end of every couple's meal.

44:44.800 --> 44:50.670
What it has here is slivers of supari
for intoxication...

44:51.600 --> 44:55.115
...shredded coconut for sweet words...

44:55.200 --> 44:58.351
fennel seeds to digest them...

44:59.960 --> 45:04.397
...and... cardamom...
to make the words last forever.

45:06.360 --> 45:07.634
We broke up.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.832
She said it was all going too fast.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.990
I guess I overwhelmed her.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.759
I'm sorry.

45:20.040 --> 45:22.190
I thought I was onto something good.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.273
<i>Spices, why punish him when I broke the rules?</i>

45:27.360 --> 45:31.319
I came by to ask if I could put this up
in your window.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.597
Yeah, sure.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.750
I'm teaching a new karate class.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.756
<i>Jagjit?</i>

45:43.840 --> 45:45.990
<i>Yes, it's Jagjit.</i>

45:46.080 --> 45:47.638
I remember that look.

45:47.720 --> 45:48.994
Thanks, huh?

45:56.840 --> 45:58.751
Hello, Jagjit.

45:58.840 --> 46:00.478
It's Jag.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.233
- Everything better in school now?
- Who told <i>you</i> ?

46:04.320 --> 46:07.312
Well, the boys, they don't trouble you any more?

46:07.400 --> 46:08.992
I've got friends now.

46:14.720 --> 46:20.909
<i>Oh, cinnamon, friend maker,</i>
<i>what have you done? What friends are these?</i>

46:22.200 --> 46:24.919
<i>Cinnamon, we are losing him.</i>

46:29.680 --> 46:31.910
<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

46:32.000 --> 46:34.389
<i>Is this the way you've chosen to punish me?</i>

46:37.160 --> 46:38.991
<i>And what about</i> him?

46:39.080 --> 46:40.593
<i>How will you punish him?</i>

46:47.080 --> 46:48.798
<i>Don't spices.</i>

46:48.880 --> 46:50.632
<i>He didn't mean to touch me.</i>

46:54.240 --> 46:57.516
<i>I won't see him again, spices.</i>

46:57.600 --> 46:59.750
<i>Please, don't hurt him.</i>

47:15.920 --> 47:17.319
Hi.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.555
<i>Such perfect timing, my clever spices.</i>

47:23.640 --> 47:27.553
I wanna make a special meal for someone,
but I've never cooked Indian before.

47:27.640 --> 47:30.074
<i>She looks like she's never chopped an onion</i>
<i>in her life.</i>

47:30.160 --> 47:32.037
I was hoping you could help me with that.

47:35.560 --> 47:37.755
Yes, of course.

47:37.840 --> 47:39.796
My problem is, I don't know what I want.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.791
Who are you cooking for?

47:43.880 --> 47:45.871
Well, it's for this guy I've been dating.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.235
But he's been kinda distant lately.

47:49.560 --> 47:50.913
I wanna make something easy.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.117
But I don't want the smell to get into my hair
and stay in the house.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.236
You know what I mean?

47:56.320 --> 47:59.312
Um... I'll find the perfect thing for you.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.038
Great.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.996
<i>I could give her mischievous mustard seed</i>
<i>to send him away from her forever.</i>

48:13.920 --> 48:15.433
<i>I really appreciate this.</i>

48:16.480 --> 48:18.436
<i>He's gonna love it.</i>

48:20.280 --> 48:24.671
Maybe you can make him
a sumptuous biryani with green cardamom.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.751
<i>You are speaking to me again.</i>

48:26.840 --> 48:28.273
OK.

48:28.360 --> 48:31.397
<i>Cardamom, to bind true loves.</i>

48:31.480 --> 48:33.789
<i>Then it must be her that he needs.</i>

48:33.880 --> 48:36.235
<i>Who am I to take away their happiness?</i>

48:43.680 --> 48:46.194
- Here's your change.
- Thanks so much.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.515
I'll have him eating out of my hand after this.

48:50.800 --> 48:52.756
I'll let you know how it turned out.

48:52.840 --> 48:54.796
You must. Good luck.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.116
<i>I must let him go.</i>

49:01.200 --> 49:03.509
<i>Or the spices will destroy us both.</i>

49:18.840 --> 49:20.717
<i>I've neglected what is important.</i>

49:22.040 --> 49:28.673
<i>Anant Soni, who comes every month for rendi,</i>
<i>oil from the castorplant.</i>

49:28.760 --> 49:31.832
<i>to massage into his mother's arthritic hands.</i>

49:33.920 --> 49:37.356
<i>And Prameela Viji</i>
<i>who sells million-dollar houses.</i>

49:37.440 --> 49:39.670
<i>and sends the money to her sister in a shelter.</i>

49:40.400 --> 49:44.393
<i>I'll give her a special blend</i>
<i>of my garam masala today, for hope.</i>

49:46.480 --> 49:51.554
<i>Thank you, spices,</i>
<i>for reminding me of my duty to others.</i>

50:36.720 --> 50:38.119
Tilo...

51:17.840 --> 51:19.512
Tilo, I need to speak to you.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.074
- Doug, I cannot...
- Just for, like, two minutes.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.319
Please.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.875
I'll get you a nimbu pani. A lime soda.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.632
It'll cool you down.

52:17.240 --> 52:20.198
So uh... what's wrong?

52:24.760 --> 52:26.432
It's my mom.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.312
She died.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.352
I'm so sorry.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.273
Was she with you?

52:42.800 --> 52:44.028
No.

52:45.880 --> 52:49.919
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... bust in here like this.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.595
I just... I think I'm in shock, you know.

52:55.240 --> 52:56.798
I should go.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.717
- No, wait.
<i>- No, you were right.</i>

52:59.800 --> 53:03.031
<i>- I shouldn't have come.</i>
- Have this drink.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.239
Please.

53:20.480 --> 53:21.799
<i>Black gold.</i>

53:21.880 --> 53:25.077
<i>Brought by traders round the world.</i>

53:25.160 --> 53:26.912
<i>King of spices.</i>

53:28.000 --> 53:30.992
Is that pepper? That was strong.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.435
<i>To help you tell your deepest secrets.</i>

53:34.320 --> 53:36.151
You can tell me whatever you want.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.838
I won't judge you.

53:41.720 --> 53:44.154
I never really talked about this with anybody.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.269
I don't even know where to start.

53:48.360 --> 53:50.351
I feel so numb.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.351
It's my mom.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.231
Her ashes just showed up at my doorstep.

53:58.280 --> 54:00.032
I don't even know how they found me.

54:02.800 --> 54:04.950
I never wanted to see her again till I met you.

54:07.760 --> 54:11.389
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>my mom died for me a long time ago.</i>

54:11.480 --> 54:16.031
<i>My dad was an orphan</i>
<i>who met my mom at a roadside diner.</i>

54:17.200 --> 54:22.558
<i>His hands were always so black</i>
<i>from working at the refinery.</i>

54:22.640 --> 54:24.312
But my mom's hands...

54:26.360 --> 54:27.873
<i>... were always perfect.</i>

54:29.360 --> 54:32.432
Vroom! Vrooom!

54:32.520 --> 54:34.192
She looked like a movie star.

54:34.280 --> 54:37.158
You know, she had these high pointy heels.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.758
<i>Even her name - Celestina -</i>

54:41.800 --> 54:43.870
<i>had more flair than the neighbors".</i>

54:47.960 --> 54:49.712
<i>She used to complain about my hair.</i>

54:49.800 --> 54:53.588
She said it was too coarse, unruly.

55:01.480 --> 55:06.429
One day this man showed up at our house
when my dad was at work.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.678
Evie. Evie!

55:15.760 --> 55:18.718
Why have you come here? To ruin my life?

55:18.800 --> 55:21.189
<i>You ought to be ashamed,</i>
<i>acting like a white woman.</i>

55:21.280 --> 55:23.396
Your little boy don't even know who he is.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.199
Dougie, honey, go back upstairs.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.799
Get out of here.

55:28.880 --> 55:31.599
He's dying.
I promised him I'd find you and tell you.

55:31.680 --> 55:33.352
I don't know owe him nothing.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.840
The next day, when my dad was gone,

55:39.920 --> 55:41.558
my mom took us on a ride.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.189
Evie.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.953
<i>Evie, my little flower.</i>

56:15.000 --> 56:18.754
You came... with your son.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.319
Please.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.470
<i>Leave the boy with me.</i>

56:23.520 --> 56:27.479
I only have a little time,
my darling granddaughter.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.313
<i>Please... let me talk to him.</i>

56:30.400 --> 56:36.999
I ask it as payment for all that you threw away.

56:37.080 --> 56:42.837
I want the boy to have a choice for his life's path.

56:42.920 --> 56:45.150
<i>As you had.</i>

56:45.240 --> 56:46.593
Please...

56:46.680 --> 56:48.557
<i>let me talk to him.</i>

56:50.280 --> 56:51.759
<i>Please.</i>

56:54.440 --> 56:56.032
You can talk to him, Tata.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.758
But I stay in the room.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.799
For you, my son.

57:42.400 --> 57:43.196
No!

57:48.640 --> 57:50.119
Tata.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.194
Come on.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.111
We've gotta get out of here.

57:56.200 --> 57:57.758
- Come on!
- No!

57:57.840 --> 58:00.832
- You killed him!
- I should never have come back here!

58:05.000 --> 58:08.754
Phew!
This pepper drink has a kick to it, I tell you.

58:09.920 --> 58:12.309
I don't even know
why I dumped all that stuff on you.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.879
I'm sorry.

58:13.960 --> 58:15.234
Come.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.072
Let's get some fresh air.

58:23.640 --> 58:26.108
It's embarrassing to bring all this stuff up.

58:27.760 --> 58:29.352
Did you ever go back?

58:33.440 --> 58:39.276
After my dad died, I left home
and stopped talking to my mom.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.716
God, I hated her.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.313
She gave it all up cos she wanted to fit in.

58:49.360 --> 58:50.998
And you just abandoned her?

58:52.080 --> 58:54.036
I'm not proud of that.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.470
I did try to find her a few years ago.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.669
But she moved away.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.158
You know, the old man...

59:05.240 --> 59:07.879
Your great-grandfather.

59:09.280 --> 59:15.515
Although he spoke to me in some language
I never heard before, I still understood him.

59:16.960 --> 59:20.714
You know what? I felt part of something.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.597
I kept that feather all these years,

59:22.680 --> 59:25.592
hoping one day I'd find
what he was trying to give me.

59:26.360 --> 59:27.713
<i>Now it's too late.</i>

59:28.800 --> 59:29.994
Is it?

59:31.200 --> 59:33.316
I'm betting you know exactly what to do.

59:35.960 --> 59:39.509
No, I don't always have all the answers, Doug.

59:43.440 --> 59:48.389
From my window in San Francisco,
sometimes I look across the bay and...

59:51.000 --> 59:53.230
...I imagine you here.

59:55.880 --> 59:57.711
I've never really been to San Francisco.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.552
You're kidding me.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.595
Well, come with me, then.
I'll show you everything, all my spots.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.159
I cannot.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.550
There's more to you than this store, Tilo.
I know that.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:18.400
And I know that... a handsome man like you
can never be alone.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.877
You'd be surprised.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.071
I didn't have a clue what I wanted till I met you.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.513
Not a clue.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.077
Did you ever feel like you just want to...

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.037
...you just want to start all over again?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.471
I guess it's easy for me to say
because I don't have what you have.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.556
I'm not rooted like you are.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.599
When the roots are too strong,
they can strangle you too.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.196
I'll see you tomorrow, then?

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.032
It's a date?

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.076
Come on.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.553
You deserve a day off.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.913
<i>Haroun.</i>

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.109
<i>I'll stay up all night</i>
<i>and split the seeds for Haroun.</i>

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.752
<i>I must protect him.</i>

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.478
<i>Hello?</i>

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.831
Are you trying to kill us?

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.717
My husband nearly choked.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.030
It's much too hot. It burnt his insides.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.753
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.796
I put the same amount of chillies in it.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.110
You've been careless, that's what's happened.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.156
Now, who's going to pay doctor's bills, huh?

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.590
I'm really sorry. Please, take back your money.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.798
How's Jagjit?
My son is none of your business.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:09.677
You've done enough damage.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.278
I am having no luck.
Satish refuses to mention Geeta.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.112
The almond and kesar powder?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.156
We did everything that you asked us to do.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:23.914
<i>Can't you see, spices?</i>
<i>All Geeta wants is to be happy.</i>

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.116
<i>Don't turn on me, spices.</i>

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.078
<i>You know my customers need me.</i>

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.957
<i>Don't punish them.</i>

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.269
<i>Dadaji, you said you would do anything</i>
<i>to bring Geeta back into the family.</i>

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.478
<i>Mix this in your rice and for one hour</i>
<i>you will have the golden tongue.</i>

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.835
<i>Whatever you ask, people must obey.</i>

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.876
OK.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.110
<i>Spices, I have to get the kalo jire to Haroun.</i>

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.476
<i>This is for him...</i>

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.516
<i>not for me.</i>

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.910
<i>I'm not leaving you, spices.</i>

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.877
<i>I will be back.</i>

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:48.238
Sure you wanna do this?

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.400
I'm going because I have to help someone.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.193
This is where I have to go.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.873
OK.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.512
Don't worry.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.556
Here's your helmet.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.318
Haroun!

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.392
He just left five minutes ago.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.473
But he comes back at sundown for prayers
and food and then he goes back out again.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.030
We must be back before sundown.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.838
I'll bring you back. Don't worry.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.831
Just shift gears.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.196
Today... I get to take care of you.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.033
Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha "Flute Mix"

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.672
Thank you.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.148
Sure you don't want me to stay for you?
I can wait here.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:58.312
No, it's OK. My friend will take me home.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.958
OK.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.553
Thank you.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:02.959
Hey!

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.799
Thanks.

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.438
I had a great day.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.353
Haroun?

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.157
He hasn't returned yet.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.151
Why don't you come in and have some hot chai?

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.912
He'll soon be home for prayers.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.956
No, thank you.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.473
Chai?

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.032
Thank you.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.759
- I'm Hameeda.
- I'm Tilo.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.238
Do you live alone?

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.629
No, no, my brother brought me here to study.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:04.312
He and his wife look after me.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.671
Do you know Haroun well?

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.354
Oh, no, he's always so busy.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.670
And he's so shy with women
he hardly speaks to me.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.469
If we meet on the stairs, he just says
"Salaam alaikum," and hurries down.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.868
He won't even look me in the eyes.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.435
That's his car. He's home.

01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:31.148
He goes to the market and always gets so much
fresh fruit, he comes up with so many bags.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.832
Haroun?

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:54.277
Haroun!

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:56.316
Help me!

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.355
No time for tears, Ladyjaan.
Hold his head like this and Bhaijaan go get help.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.670
- Ambulance?
- No, no, who knows who they'll tell?

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.432
We'll get Rahman sahib instead.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.435
Haroun.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.756
<i>I'm so sorry I failed you.</i>

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.070
<i>Distracted by my own desires.</i>

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.034
So many wounds like this I've had to stitch.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.273
Nobody puts this in letters
when sending money home.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.112
Tilo, daughter, you have gone too far.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.272
This will destroy you and everything you are.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.634
First Mother.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.029
You must return now to where you belong.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.872
You are in danger.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.029
You have broken too many rules.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.355
But we have to live by different rules here.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.590
Maybe the spices are not enough
by themselves.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.910
You are nothing without the spices.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.753
The spices are your tradition.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.910
Do not let America seduce you.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.190
With your dreams of love,
you have roused the spices' hate.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.157
You know about him?

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.836
To all whom a mistress loves,
as she should not...

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.399
chaos will come.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.636
<i>I want the spices.</i>

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:42.517
<i>And him.</i>

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:47.879
If a mistress fails in her duty, fire is the end.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.872
<i>The spices will decide.</i>

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.272
I'm not waiting as long for you
to take another day off, you know.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.392
It's not going to work.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.152
What do you mean?

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.952
There are rules.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.715
So?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.592
Your mother broke the rules
and look how that hurt you.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.437
That was her choice.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.556
But you helped me make sense of it.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.710
You said I can be whoever the hell I want to be.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.836
So can you.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.191
Don't kill this.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.189
Don't kill this before it's even started.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.837
I'm coming back for you tonight.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.792
<i>Spices, I know it cannot be.</i>

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.631
<i>I have chosen to go back.</i>

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.108
Hello, Beti.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.912
It's still hurting.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.275
But I had to come and thank you.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.552
Geeta's coming home with her boyfriend,
that Tony fellow.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.517
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.637
<i>You have helped open eyes,</i>
<i>so Geeta can marry her love.</i>

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.312
I'm not going to say anything.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:05.152
Hello!

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.829
I saw the poster in your window
and went along to his class.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:13.913
<i>And saffron,</i>
<i>Myisha and Kwesi have found love, too.</i>

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.797
He can cook, too.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.552
She taught me everything I know.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.074
<i>What do we get?</i>
<i>Anything with garlic.</i>

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.151
Everything OK, Jagjit?

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:24.595
Yeah, it's all good.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.478
Don't be scared. It's just a bus backfiring.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.596
Scared? I ain't scared.

01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:37.717
Are you all right, son? Somebody after you?

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:43.076
How would you like never to be scared again,
Jagjit?

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.868
Teach him, till he's a master like you.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.712
Why are you doing this?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.030
Because I want to.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.908
<i>Cinnamon,</i>
<i>you have found a true friend for Jagjit</i>

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.958
<i>to guide him through the highs and lows</i>
<i>of life in America.</i>

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.271
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>
<i>Their desires are now fulfilled.</i>

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:12.793
Whatever, man...

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.552
I never got to cook for him.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.756
Turns out he's fallen in love with someone else.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.679
He told you that?

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.398
Yeah.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.950
I can't hate him for it.
I've never seen him so happy.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.075
<i>Please, spices, give me one night with Doug.</i>

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.555
<i>One night for</i> my <i>desires.</i>

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.950
<i>Then you have me forever.</i>

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.076
Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.756
Ladyjaan.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.076
You look... different.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.758
Or is it my eye playing?

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.710
I have brought something for you.

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.472
Are you feeling better?

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.553
Oh, yes.
Hameeda and her brother have been very kind.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:32.838
She's been cooking all day for us
and she's been keeping me company.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.831
Today will you have some chai?

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:38.632
And you?

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.075
Sure. I'll help her.

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.156
Haroun... I've come to say goodbye.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:53.319
Where are you going?

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.437
I'm returning back home.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.550
What about your store, Ladyjaan,
and your customers?

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:04.393
Is it not right for us to go back
to where we belong?

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.475
Not for me, Ladyjaan.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.551
Are you not angry at what they did to you?

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.151
Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.233
But I still have both my eyes
and I have such friends.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.677
<i>Haroun, you have found so much more</i>
<i>than wealth here.</i>

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:25.469
<i>You came for a dream and found love.</i>

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.269
Now, what did you bring for me?

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:32.718
It's for Hameeda.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.356
Well, actually... it's for you both... together.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.152
<i>Lotus root.</i>

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:43.595
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.353
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.078
Here it is.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.679
What do you think?

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.591
It's uh... It's beautiful.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.352
Is this yours?

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.512
Oh, yeah. It's an old bakery, actually.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.392
I just love the idea of making old things new.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.112
There's something cool about it.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.954
<i>Forgive me, Doug,</i>
<i>but I have to return to where I belong.</i>

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.555
<i>You showed me such love.</i>

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.993
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.036
<i>But it cannot be.</i>

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.594
<i>I do not expect you to understand.</i>

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.989
<i>But there is no other way.</i>

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.957
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:03.271
<i>I will carry your love with me forever.</i>

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.512
<i>Spices.</i>

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.556
<i>I never left you.</i>

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.437
<i>I could have lived with you.</i>

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.879
<i>And him.</i>

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.554
<i>Love cannot be wrong.</i>

01:22:55.960 --> 01:23:00.033
<i>But I will leave him, if it means losing you.</i>

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.792
<i>I give my life to you.</i>

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.599
Tilo!

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:15.113
Tilo!

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.236
Are you OK?

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.311
Are you OK?

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.672
I woke up and you were gone.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.918
I read your note.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.231
I crossed the bridge and just
as I got to the other side...

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.356
...the quake hit.

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.112
Are you sure you're OK?

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.918
Yes.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:04.315
Let's get you out... Let's get you out of here.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:29.077
Tilo Mistress,
you have shown your devotion to the spices.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.829
The spices know you will never leave them.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.998
Doug, I'm not leaving.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.837
You're staying with me.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.831
I mean here.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.273
I'm not leaving here.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.999
Tilo, there's nothing left here.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.357
This is my home.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.275
I guess I can help you rebuild it.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.634
You never told me what my spice is.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.078
Sesame.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:15.792
Tilo.
