WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:06.547
Do you realize this is the last time
we'll be here in the coffeehouse...

00:06.798 --> 00:08.340
...as six single people?

00:08.550 --> 00:11.510
What's happening to the coffeehouse?

00:12.137 --> 00:13.512
Oh! Okay.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.726
From now on, it's you four
and me and the missus.

00:18.935 --> 00:22.479
The little woman. The wife.
The old ball and chain.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.983
- Old?
- The young, hot ball and chain.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.736
- Much better.
- We gotta go.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.488
- Where?
- Get the dress and lunch with mom.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.950
Joey, you too?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.369
I just heard "lunch."

00:37.871 --> 00:39.872
Yeah, I can go. Sure.

00:42.625 --> 00:46.462
Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.256
I need to talk to you
about something.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.593
- What's up?
- This may be a little awkward.

00:52.802 --> 00:57.639
If you need money, it's a bad time.
I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.100
No, it's not that.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.438
I'm not gonna say this
as your friend...

01:04.647 --> 01:07.066
...but as Monica's older brother.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.736
- But you're still my friend?
- Not for a few minutes.

01:10.987 --> 01:15.115
- Right now, are you still my best man?
- No.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.078
- Do I still call you Ross?
- Okay.

01:21.206 --> 01:26.418
You guys are getting married,
and I couldn't be more thrilled.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.380
But as Monica's older brother,
I have to tell you this:

01:32.425 --> 01:35.761
If you ever hurt my little sister...

01:36.346 --> 01:41.642
...if you ever cause her
any unhappiness of any kind...

01:42.018 --> 01:44.103
...I will hunt you down...

01:45.021 --> 01:47.022
...and kick your ass.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.406
What? I'm serious.

01:58.368 --> 02:03.413
- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
- I hear what you're saying...

02:04.249 --> 02:06.333
...and thanks for the warning.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.876
No problem.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.130
So are we friends again?

02:11.381 --> 02:12.673
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:12.841 --> 02:17.261
Ahem. You won't believe what Monica's
brother just said to me!

02:57.093 --> 02:58.552
What you doing, Mon?

02:58.803 --> 03:02.806
I'm listing all the things that
could go wrong at the wedding.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.268
So I can be prepared.

03:06.519 --> 03:10.898
- Mm-hm. What are they?
- "The dresses won't get picked up...

03:11.149 --> 03:14.568
...veil gets lost,
and I'm missing something blue."

03:14.819 --> 03:16.862
Those are all the things I'm responsible for.

03:18.323 --> 03:20.240
I had to go with the odds.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.826
Hey! You guys!

03:23.036 --> 03:25.495
Remember I had that audition a while ago,
and I didn't get that part?

03:25.663 --> 03:26.747
- The commercial?
- No.

03:26.915 --> 03:27.915
- That play?
- No.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.374
- That other play?
- No.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.668
- The movie?
- Yes!

03:31.920 --> 03:35.297
- The one about the pilot and his dog?
- No.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.716
But man, that one hurt.

03:37.926 --> 03:42.095
- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
- Oh, yeah.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.098
Back then we called it
"The Great War."

03:46.517 --> 03:48.352
It really was.

03:49.479 --> 03:53.273
A guy they wanted backed out
and now they want me! I start shooting today!

03:53.524 --> 03:54.650
Congratulations!

03:54.901 --> 03:58.320
- Today's the rehearsal dinner.
- I'll be done by then.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.281
Oh. Then way to go,
you big movie star!

04:01.574 --> 04:04.243
See you.
I'm off to fight the Nazis.

04:04.494 --> 04:08.830
Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
in WWll, not WWI.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.083
Whoa. Okay.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.210
Who was in WWI?

04:16.380 --> 04:17.755
Go ahead.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.218
- You're gonna be late! Go! Go!
- Yeah, I'll see you.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.681
Who did we fight in WWI?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.475
- Mexico?
- Yes. Very good.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.244
- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
- Yeah, me too.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.538
Richard, we're ready for you.

04:49.789 --> 04:53.417
Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
is playing Vincent.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.462
- I'm doing my scenes with you?
- Nice to meet you.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.842
I can't believe this. Incredible.
You just won an Oscar.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.261
No, I didn't.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.555
I think you did.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.767
I think I lost, three times.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.688
- Uh, cookie? Would you?
- No.

05:15.398 --> 05:19.401
Okay. We're about an hour away
from getting the scene lit.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.864
- So, uh, can you guys run it a couple times?
- Yeah, sure.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.949
All right. Let's do it.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.703
And action!

05:29.996 --> 05:34.041
- We have to find the platoon!
- Forget the platoon. The platoon is gone!

05:37.253 --> 05:41.381
- What?
- The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!

05:42.925 --> 05:46.219
What'll we do?
We have no reinforcements or food.

05:46.471 --> 05:50.223
There's food in the basement.
Potatoes and some pasta.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.770
Hang on. Joey, you keep
touching your face.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.104
Something wrong?

05:57.065 --> 05:58.774
No.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.359
I, uh...

06:00.568 --> 06:03.570
I thought it might be
a cool character thing.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.615
He's a face toucher.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.745
I don't think so.

06:13.081 --> 06:17.209
Let's take it back
to Richard's last lines. Action!

06:18.002 --> 06:20.587
We may not have any weapons,
but we still have food.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.589
Potatoes, pasta...

06:22.840 --> 06:24.758
...and a few tins of tuna!

06:27.595 --> 06:29.930
- Honey, we gotta go!
- Okay.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.307
Here's a question
you never want to ask:

06:32.558 --> 06:36.436
My dad just called and wants to know if he can
borrow one of your pearl necklaces?

06:37.355 --> 06:39.981
Did he say what kind of neckline
he's wearing?

06:40.942 --> 06:41.983
No.

06:42.610 --> 06:46.279
I've only met him once
but I'm guessing, plunging?

06:46.531 --> 06:51.201
He is more of a "If you've got it,
flaunt it" kind of father.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.579
I don't have anything
but let me see if Rachel does.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.873
Yes, include more people
in this.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.921
Hey. Do you realize that tomorrow
we're gonna be getting married?

07:03.214 --> 07:05.215
I have a date tomorrow night.

07:06.592 --> 07:10.720
- I can't believe we made it.
- You don't have to sound so surprised.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.431
I'm sorry, but...

07:13.307 --> 07:15.809
- Nothing.
- What?

07:17.103 --> 07:20.397
Well, honestly?
Ever since we got engaged...

07:20.648 --> 07:23.442
...I've waited for you to flip out.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.236
Honestly? Me too.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.572
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:28.823 --> 07:32.242
I think that something
stupid will come up and I'll...

07:33.035 --> 07:34.327
...go all Chandler.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.497
- But nothing has.
- I'm so glad.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.500
Thank you for staying
so calm during this.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.961
It's made me stay calm.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.214
- I could've been worse.
- Okay.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.425
I'll be right there.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.476
Hi, if you're calling before Saturday...

07:57.643 --> 07:59.186
...you've reached Monica and Chandler.

07:59.353 --> 08:03.815
But if you're calling after Saturday,
you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.277
Please leave a message for
the Bings!

08:24.128 --> 08:25.837
- Maureen!
- Hi.

08:26.005 --> 08:30.634
- Gosh. This is my cousin, Maureen.
- We're the Bings.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.597
Hi! You guys look so beautiful.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.558
Mr. And Mrs. Bing!

08:41.562 --> 08:43.563
Wow, Monica.

08:43.813 --> 08:47.609
So you know, I had my
older-brother talk with Chandler.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.653
- What is that?
- Well, I...

08:49.904 --> 08:52.531
I told him that if he ever hurt you...

08:52.782 --> 08:56.618
...I would hunt him down
and kick his ass.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.958
What is the matter with everybody?
I'm serious.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.460
I would kick his ass!

09:07.296 --> 09:10.340
Ross, please, my makeup!

09:12.176 --> 09:13.218
Hi.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.970
- Chandler.
- Mom.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.764
Thanks for wearing... something.

09:19.559 --> 09:24.896
Ohh. This is so exciting! I thought we
screwed you up too much for this.

09:26.399 --> 09:31.069
Just think, soon there will be
lots of little Bings.

09:35.783 --> 09:39.327
I can't believe I have to go back to work
after this and get spit on again.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.998
You're lucky. At least the people
who spit on you are famous.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.335
- Who spits on you?
- I don't wanna talk about work.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.592
Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
Judy and Jack Geller.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.637
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Are you his mother or father?

09:57.888 --> 09:59.598
Jack!

10:00.558 --> 10:03.184
What? I've never seen one before.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.729
Dad, there's Ross.
Go talk to him.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.190
I didn't even have a chance to act
as if I'm okay with it.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.487
Hello, all.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.532
Hi... Dad.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.369
Hi, Mr. Bing.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.957
- Nora.
- Charles.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.587
- It's so great to see you both here.
- Yes.

10:30.838 --> 10:34.507
Although we may be seeing
too much of some people.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.555
Aren't you too old
to wear a dress like that?

10:40.806 --> 10:44.934
Don't you have too much penis
to wear a dress like that?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.355
Oh, my God.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.693
Of course you can kick his ass, son.

10:53.944 --> 10:57.447
You could kick anyone's ass
you want to.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.992
Thanks, you guys.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.747
- Rach, Rach?
- Yeah?

11:05.998 --> 11:10.001
Do me a favor. Talk to Chandler's dad
and keep him away from Chandler's mom.

11:10.252 --> 11:14.547
- Yeah, but I don't know what he looks like.
- He is the man in a black dress.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.642
Hi. I'm Rachel, a friend of
Monica and Chandler's.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.978
- I'm Amanda.
- Oh, I get it.

11:29.230 --> 11:32.482
"A man, duh!"

11:37.154 --> 11:39.239
Could I have your attention?

11:40.199 --> 11:44.577
- I'm Ross Geller.
- Dr. Ross Geller.

11:45.621 --> 11:49.582
Dad, please. As I was saying...

11:49.834 --> 11:52.502
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.880
Uh, and I'm the best man.

11:56.048 --> 12:00.510
And this marriage
is doubly special for me...

12:00.678 --> 12:04.848
...um, because not only is the groom
my best friend...

12:05.015 --> 12:09.602
...but, uh, the bride is my little sister.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.107
She's the greatest sister
a guy could ask for.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.361
Please join me in raising a glass...

12:18.571 --> 12:22.449
...to the couple we're
here to celebrate.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.077
- To the Bings.
- To the Bings!

12:34.420 --> 12:36.296
I'm gonna steam my dress.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.299
Who will make sure nothing
happens to it?

12:39.550 --> 12:42.302
- I'll do it.
- Who wants it? Anybody?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.221
- I said I'll do it.
- Nobody?

12:45.473 --> 12:49.517
- All right, I'll do it myself.
- I'm not gonna screw it up.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.354
You're right. I'm sorry.
You were a big help tonight.

12:53.606 --> 12:57.192
And thanks for putting my grandmother
in the cab to get to the hotel.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.487
- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
- Okay. Sorry.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.072
Ugh! Pssh.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.033
What grandmother?

13:09.246 --> 13:12.832
- Where have you been?
- Taking my parents to the hotel.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.168
- Going back to work?
- Yeah.

13:15.419 --> 13:19.005
- Nice shades.
- If I wear these in my scenes...

13:19.215 --> 13:21.633
...I won't get spit in my eyes.

13:22.468 --> 13:27.764
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
was the official sponsor of WWI.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.351
Great! All right!

13:31.769 --> 13:33.478
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.065
- Where's Chandler?
- I think he's in Rachel's room. See you.

13:38.400 --> 13:46.241
Chandler?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.300
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.720
- Is Monica here?
- She's steaming her dress. Why?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.558
- I think Chandler's gone.
- What?

14:12.518 --> 14:16.437
- He left that.
- "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

14:17.147 --> 14:19.065
Oh, my God.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.109
What's up?

14:23.112 --> 14:25.530
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

14:27.408 --> 14:28.867
Tell her yourself.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.334
Oh, my God.
Chandler just left, though?

14:38.586 --> 14:41.170
Maybe it's not what we think.
Maybe it's:

14:41.422 --> 14:45.216
"Tell Monica I'm sorry
I drank the last of the milk."

14:45.676 --> 14:51.097
Or maybe he was writing to tell
her that he's changed his name:

14:51.515 --> 14:54.058
"Tell Monica, I'm Sorry."

14:56.020 --> 15:01.065
- It means he freaked out and left!
- Don't be so negative!

15:01.525 --> 15:06.905
Good God, isn't it possible that
"Sorry" is sitting in there right now?

15:08.032 --> 15:12.035
Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
What are we gonna do?

15:12.369 --> 15:15.872
I'm gonna have to go find him
and bring him back.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.709
You make sure Monica
does not find out, okay?

15:19.960 --> 15:23.087
But, if you don't find him
and bring him back...

15:23.339 --> 15:27.425
...I am gonna hunt you down
and kick your ass!

15:29.345 --> 15:31.179
I will find him.

15:34.391 --> 15:37.727
Joey? Can you
go through these lines with me?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.980
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.568
- Just the last two pages.
- All right.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.616
I found the picture!

15:53.035 --> 15:54.744
Picture? What picture?

15:54.995 --> 15:58.081
The picture of my wife!
I found it in your pack!

15:58.374 --> 16:00.416
Could you lower the script?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.877
I don't want to.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.340
I need to see your face so
I can play off your reaction.

16:08.801 --> 16:09.968
Okay, look.

16:10.177 --> 16:14.931
I know you're great
and play all those Shakespeare guys...

16:15.182 --> 16:17.725
...but you're spitting
all over me, man.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.562
- Of course I am!
- You know you've been spitting?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.065
That's what real actors do.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.736
Enunciation is the mark
of a good actor.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.198
And when you enunciate, you spit!

16:34.326 --> 16:36.911
Wow. Didn't know that.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.080
Thanks. Okay, check it out.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.876
Picture? What picture?

16:52.636 --> 16:56.389
- Have you seen Chandler?
- No, I haven't seen him.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.684
- Damn.
- He's getting married tomorrow, right?

16:59.935 --> 17:02.645
Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.190
- See you at the wedding.
- I wasn't invited.

17:07.943 --> 17:11.194
Then we'll see you
the day after tomorrow.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.657
Mom? Dad?

17:16.492 --> 17:18.202
What are you doing here?

17:18.454 --> 17:21.914
You kids talk about this place so much,
we thought we'd see what the fuss is all about.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.835
- I see why the girls like coming here.
- Why?

17:26.086 --> 17:28.796
The sexy blond behind the counter.

17:34.428 --> 17:38.389
- Gunther?
- She just added him to her list.

17:39.391 --> 17:43.102
- Your list?
- Of people we're allowed to sleep...

17:43.395 --> 17:45.938
I know what the list is.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.733
Sit down, have a cup of joe.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.487
I can't, I'm sorry.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.157
If you see Chandler,
tell him I'm looking for him.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.869
And if you see Rita Moreno,
let her know I'm looking for her.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.585
Action!

18:11.006 --> 18:12.799
I found the picture!

18:13.342 --> 18:15.426
What picture?

18:16.553 --> 18:19.597
A picture of my wife, in your pack!

18:20.265 --> 18:22.934
You went through my personal property?

18:24.311 --> 18:27.814
Why do you have a picture of Paulette
in your pack?

18:31.068 --> 18:34.403
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...

18:35.531 --> 18:37.532
...for two years!

18:37.741 --> 18:40.451
Cut! Wonderful!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.705
Great scene, huh?

18:44.957 --> 18:48.584
You were awesome.
In that last speech, you soaked me.

18:49.169 --> 18:52.255
- Tomorrow's call sheet.
- I'm not working tomorrow.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.550
- You are now.
- No, you gotta get me out of it.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.052
I have plans. Important plans!

19:06.353 --> 19:10.189
- Still no word from Chandler.
- Oh, man.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.818
But they found the grandmother
wandering down 5th.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.363
Okay, well there's one down.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.700
I'm getting married today!

19:24.496 --> 19:28.207
I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
Today's my wedding!

19:28.417 --> 19:30.960
My day is finally here!

19:33.714 --> 19:36.340
She might not even notice he's gone.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.303
I'm gonna start getting ready!

19:42.097 --> 19:46.142
We can't let her start getting ready.
This is too awful!

19:46.351 --> 19:49.478
She'll be in the gown,
and he won't show up.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.607
Then she'll
have to take off the gown...

19:52.816 --> 19:55.484
Stop it. You can't do this here.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.613
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.324
It's just so sad.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.577
Pull it together.
She can't see you like this.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.997
- She'll know something's wrong.
- I know. I know.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.499
There's no tissue.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.211
Can you grab me some toilet paper?

20:13.420 --> 20:17.381
Oh, that's gone too.
This is Monica's bathroom, right?

20:18.133 --> 20:20.718
- I found one.
- Okay.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.306
Thank you.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.391
Oh, God.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.771
Can I have another one?

20:32.814 --> 20:34.232
Sure.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.278
Do you need some floss?

20:41.031 --> 20:44.700
I can't imagine what will happen
if he doesn't show up.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.452
Here's a whole bunch.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.871
She'll be at the wedding waiting...

20:49.122 --> 20:52.625
...and people will be whispering,
"That poor girl."

20:52.834 --> 20:56.212
Then she'll have to come back here
and live alone.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.297
- Oh, my God.
- What?

20:58.548 --> 21:03.970
There was a pregnancy test
in the garbage, and it's positive.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.681
Monica's pregnant.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.686
So I guess she won't be totally alone.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.527
Next time on Friends:

21:19.695 --> 21:22.446
- We've gotta tell her that he's gone.
- No, we can't.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.282
She's gonna start getting ready soon.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.450
Can't you stall her a little?

21:26.618 --> 21:28.703
I'm never gonna get married.

21:30.289 --> 21:34.959
We've just got one short scene.
It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.045
- Are you drunk?
- No!

21:38.213 --> 21:40.881
- Yes, you are!
- All right.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.218
- How's Chandler?
- Great!

21:44.386 --> 21:45.970
- Where are you?
- On the set.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.806
This is turning into the worst
wedding day ever.
