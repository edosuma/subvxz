WEBVTT

00:02.963 --> 00:04.898
Going once,

00:04.965 --> 00:07.467
Going twice,

00:07.535 --> 00:10.470
Sold! The ringside seats

00:10.538 --> 00:14.374
To the crystal cove
lady banshees roller derby team

00:14.441 --> 00:16.709
Go to Gary Papluta.

00:16.777 --> 00:20.113
This charity auction is going better
than I ever could have hoped.

00:20.181 --> 00:22.215
What's our total
so far, Sheila?

00:22.283 --> 00:24.250
$34.

00:24.318 --> 00:28.488
Ah! Just imagine all
the good $34 will do.

00:28.556 --> 00:30.990
The next lot up for bid is

00:31.058 --> 00:33.927
This spooky painting.

00:33.994 --> 00:37.330
Ooh! Now that's what I call art.

00:37.398 --> 00:40.066
Do I hear $5.00?

00:41.702 --> 00:44.804
Uh, $4.00?

00:44.872 --> 00:47.307
$3.00?

00:47.374 --> 00:50.810
Come on. This is
a genuine spooky painting.

00:50.878 --> 00:53.513
Well, this thing is creeping me
out just looking at it.

00:53.581 --> 00:54.681
Anybody?

00:56.250 --> 00:57.617
Anybody?

01:01.822 --> 01:04.190
Give me that painting!

01:07.828 --> 01:10.930
It's locked! It's locked!

01:17.538 --> 01:19.205
The vampire's gone!

01:19.273 --> 01:22.442
So is the painting.

Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:00.214 --> 02:02.382
Like, Scooby doo,

02:02.449 --> 02:05.952
There's something about putting a
teeny-tiny umbrella in your drink

02:06.020 --> 02:08.454
That just makes it better.

02:08.521 --> 02:11.190
Yeah. I heard that.

02:13.027 --> 02:14.861
Now, this is purely
hypothetical,

02:14.928 --> 02:18.364
But let's say your extravagant grotto
was haunted by a pool monster.

02:18.432 --> 02:21.734
Want to know how I'd trap it?
Uh, could you tell me later?

02:21.802 --> 02:26.239
First I'd use some combination of shag or
scoob to lure him under the waterfall,

02:26.307 --> 02:29.809
Then I'd add quick-drying cement
to the water and boo-yah!

02:29.877 --> 02:32.478
Trapped.

02:32.546 --> 02:34.480
Oh, shaggy,

02:34.548 --> 02:37.450
Like my new bikini?

02:37.518 --> 02:41.220
Um, like, I don't know.
Are you wearing one?

02:41.288 --> 02:45.124
Yes! I just don't want
to get burned.

02:45.192 --> 02:47.627
Do you have any idea
of how damaging the sun is?

02:47.695 --> 02:51.731
Give me a call when someone wants to make
a leathery handbag out of your back fat.

02:52.966 --> 02:56.002
Hey, don't worry, Velma.
I think you look great.

02:56.070 --> 03:00.239
And with the sun reflecting off
your pale, colorless skin,

03:00.307 --> 03:04.544
We can blind the monster and just push him
into the pool with the cement already in it.

03:04.611 --> 03:06.646
Genius!
Fred!

03:07.581 --> 03:09.415
Boy, am I steamed.

03:09.483 --> 03:11.017
What's wrong, mom?

03:11.085 --> 03:13.686
A vampire ruined
my auction last night.

03:13.754 --> 03:16.356
Vampire?

03:16.423 --> 03:18.191
A mystery. Quick, Velma.

03:18.258 --> 03:20.860
Set your milky whiteness for "stun.
" Mmm!

03:20.928 --> 03:22.128
- Fred!
- What?

03:22.196 --> 03:25.865
It's OK, Daphne.
I don't care what Fred thinks.

03:37.411 --> 03:41.881
Guys, mystery.
Time's running out. Go, let's.

03:41.949 --> 03:45.017
I'm not solving any mystery
if he's going to be there.

03:45.085 --> 03:47.353
You know, Fred,
maybe we should split up.

03:47.421 --> 03:50.022
It's too early.
We can't split up until we get

03:50.090 --> 03:53.292
To a haunted amusement park
or a terrifying cavern...

03:53.360 --> 03:56.662
Actually, dude, like, I think
splitting up is a good idea.

03:56.730 --> 03:59.866
Yeah. You've already made that
perfectly clear.

03:59.933 --> 04:03.403
Ok, then.
We'll be splitting up.

04:06.974 --> 04:08.841
So, where shall we start?

04:08.909 --> 04:11.644
I'm thinking pedicures.

04:14.581 --> 04:17.916
Like, is it me
or does this feel weird?

04:17.985 --> 04:20.452
Yeah, it's strange mysterying
without the girls.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.055
No, I mean sitting shotgun.

04:23.123 --> 04:25.491
Ha ha! Like, I never get
to ride up here.

04:25.559 --> 04:27.994
It's awesome!

04:28.061 --> 04:29.495
Stereo.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.835
Yeah!

04:35.903 --> 04:38.838
If you were a vampire,
where would you hide out?

04:38.906 --> 04:41.741
- The clam cabin?
- The pizza pail?

04:41.809 --> 04:44.010
Right! Let's try the cemetery.

04:52.553 --> 04:55.888
Velma, here's the only thing you'll

04:55.956 --> 04:58.758
They are stupid.
If you give a boy two choices...

04:58.826 --> 05:03.062
A smart one and a stupid one... he will
always make the stupid one, every time.

05:03.130 --> 05:06.766
That's why you never give them a choice.
That's depressing.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.268
Yes, it is,
but what can you do?

05:09.336 --> 05:12.338
Boys look really cute in ascots.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.577
Where's your mom going
at this hour?

05:17.644 --> 05:21.180
Beats me.
Mom! Where are you going?

05:21.248 --> 05:25.251
Me? Oh. Well, um, I'm just
running out to the grocery store

05:25.319 --> 05:27.753
To get some, uh...Pate.

05:27.821 --> 05:30.590
Yeah. Pate. Mm-hmm.
See you later.

05:30.657 --> 05:32.291
Weird.

05:32.359 --> 05:34.227
My mom is duck-intolerant.

05:34.294 --> 05:37.597
Pate gives her the squeakers real bad.
Something's up.

05:37.664 --> 05:40.099
Come on.
What about our massages?

05:40.167 --> 05:43.336
Sorry, Velma.
Duty before beauty.

05:54.114 --> 05:58.050
The lady at the blood bank said they haven't
seen a vampire tonight or any night.

05:58.118 --> 06:02.054
Actually, her exact words were
"out of my blood bank, freakwad!"

06:02.122 --> 06:05.291
- Is... is that b-b-blood?

06:05.359 --> 06:06.792
What? Oh, no.

06:06.860 --> 06:09.195
I just snagged a red punch
juice box and spilled some.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.731
They've got tons hanging
all over the place.

06:11.798 --> 06:15.902
So that's a big, fat no on the cemetery,
the zoo's bat exhibit, and the blood bank.

06:15.969 --> 06:17.336
What now?

06:17.404 --> 06:19.739
I'm running out of ideas.

06:19.806 --> 06:22.742
I got it! Fruitmeyer's.

06:22.809 --> 06:25.177
Scoob! That's genius!

06:25.245 --> 06:30.683
It's a little out of the box, but everyone
loves fruitmeyer's, even vampires.

06:36.823 --> 06:37.924
She's gone.

06:37.991 --> 06:39.425
She's a freak.

06:39.493 --> 06:41.494
She's the fastest mom alive.

06:41.562 --> 06:43.996
- She speed-walks
every morning.

06:44.064 --> 06:46.432
Well, your mom must have
thighs like tree trunks,

06:46.500 --> 06:48.501
'cause we totally lost her.

06:48.569 --> 06:50.937
She has got to be
around here somewhere.

06:51.004 --> 06:54.240
A light's on
at the botanical gardens.

06:54.308 --> 06:57.109
This makes no sense.
My mom hates nature.

06:57.177 --> 06:59.545
She hates anything
she doesn't have to pay for.

07:07.621 --> 07:10.556
Like, man, I do not get girls.

07:10.624 --> 07:14.226
Yeah. Chicks.

07:14.294 --> 07:16.629
- Why don't
- um, I don't know, Fred.

07:16.697 --> 07:19.131
Trust me. Nothing says
"I love you"

07:19.199 --> 07:22.134
Like 200 feet of parachute cord
and a cargo net.

07:24.438 --> 07:26.038
Hey, what was that?

07:26.106 --> 07:28.774
It came from down the hill.

07:31.912 --> 07:35.915
I bet you clams to casino that our
vampire's inside the greenhouse.

07:35.983 --> 07:38.417
Mmm, clams.

07:38.485 --> 07:40.186
What do we do now, Fred?

07:40.253 --> 07:42.254
We trap ourselves a vampire!

07:42.322 --> 07:45.191
Hey, Freddy,
where do you get this stuff?

07:45.258 --> 07:49.261
Trap mart. I'm a premier member
of the frequent trappers club.

07:51.098 --> 07:54.967
Eww! Smells like that stuff you
put on plants to help them grow.

07:55.035 --> 07:56.202
You mean poo?

07:56.269 --> 07:58.537
Yeah. That's what
it smells like.

08:07.414 --> 08:11.350
- That is a two-inch-thick, bone-in
ribeye with perfect marbling.

08:11.418 --> 08:14.587
No self-respecting vampire
will be able to resist it.

08:15.689 --> 08:17.723
I know I can't.

08:17.791 --> 08:20.192
Somebody's coming.

08:29.603 --> 08:31.037
Ha! Gotcha!

08:31.104 --> 08:33.272
Hit the lights!

08:38.278 --> 08:41.212
Fred! What are you doing?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.749
Shaggy, get me out of here!

08:43.817 --> 08:44.984
Now!

08:49.923 --> 08:53.359
Like, um, you look nice?

08:53.427 --> 08:54.427
Save it.

08:56.096 --> 08:57.530
What was that?

09:09.737 --> 09:12.239
- What do we do?
- We're doing it!

09:16.477 --> 09:17.944
Yikes!

09:18.012 --> 09:20.080
Run!

09:21.249 --> 09:23.250
Fred! Don't let go of me!

09:23.317 --> 09:25.919
Don't worry, Daph!
I wouldn't...

09:25.987 --> 09:29.089
Think of it. Ah, nuts!

09:30.324 --> 09:33.527
Scoob, like, I think
the exit is this way.

09:35.663 --> 09:38.899
- Why did we have to go
vampire-hunting?

09:38.966 --> 09:40.567
Yikes!

09:42.703 --> 09:45.805
Yikes! Help! Help!

09:45.873 --> 09:48.375
What the hoosit now? Huh?

09:48.442 --> 09:51.111
Help!

09:55.149 --> 09:57.951
Prickers!

10:01.355 --> 10:03.089
Is everyone OK?

10:03.157 --> 10:04.524
How are you doing, hero?

10:04.592 --> 10:06.526
Like, I've been better.

10:06.594 --> 10:09.629
Oh. You don't really care,
though, do you?

10:11.265 --> 10:14.234
My star orchid. It's gone.

10:14.302 --> 10:16.603
I don't get it.

10:16.671 --> 10:20.340
What would a vampire want with
a painting and an orchid?

10:22.643 --> 10:25.145
I don't care if there was
a weather delay.

10:25.213 --> 10:27.147
When I order a crate full
of Sumatran rat monkeys

10:27.215 --> 10:30.016
From skull island, I expect
overnight delivery.

10:30.084 --> 10:32.419
Those things get stale fast.

10:32.486 --> 10:35.989
If we're going to find out what this vamp
is up to, we need to do some research.

10:36.057 --> 10:39.659
Hey, mom. Oh, hey, kids.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

10:39.727 --> 10:42.162
Mrs. Dinkley, we need
some information on...

10:42.230 --> 10:43.763
vampires.

10:43.831 --> 10:48.068
Vampires? Oh, sugar plums,
you've come to the right place.

10:50.004 --> 10:52.939
The broken spine has the most extensive
collection of bloodsucker lit

10:53.007 --> 10:55.175
This side of
the Carpathian mountains.

10:55.243 --> 10:57.677
Huh. There must be something
in here that will tell us

10:57.745 --> 11:01.114
Why a vampire would want
a painting and an orchid.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.688
Hello. Is someone there?

11:20.434 --> 11:23.436
Wow. You just don't like
this shelf.

11:23.504 --> 11:25.438
Oh, for crying out loud.

11:25.506 --> 11:26.840
Who are you?

11:26.907 --> 11:28.942
The answers you seek

11:29.010 --> 11:31.177
Are inside.

11:34.348 --> 11:37.450
But wait. Who are...

11:37.518 --> 11:40.453
You?

11:40.521 --> 11:43.957
There's nothing in any of these books
about a painting or an orchid.

11:44.025 --> 11:47.627
- I guess we've hit a dead end.
- More like an undead end.

11:47.695 --> 11:50.130
Guys, I think I found
what we're looking for.

11:50.197 --> 11:52.632
It's an old Halloween issue
of "celebrities weekly,"

11:52.700 --> 11:55.035
And on page 128 is...

11:55.102 --> 11:57.637
"countess hagula's
youth juice."

11:57.705 --> 12:01.641
"4 essential ingredients, and
eternal youth can be all yours."

12:01.709 --> 12:03.943
But this is just
a stupid Halloween prank.

12:04.011 --> 12:07.714
Looks like someone didn't get the joke.

12:07.782 --> 12:12.052
The pigment from our stolen painting
and the pollen of a star orchid.

12:12.119 --> 12:15.555
This is it. Our vampire must be
trying to make some youth juice.

12:15.623 --> 12:18.391
Good work, Daphne!
- Mm-hmm.

12:18.459 --> 12:21.394
Yeah. And, like, nice call,
Velma, on coming here.

12:21.462 --> 12:23.063
Too little too late.

12:23.130 --> 12:25.565
If we want to know where the
vampire is going to strike next,

12:25.633 --> 12:27.567
We just need
to check the recipe.

12:27.635 --> 12:31.071
Then we can get there first
and trap her in a trap.

12:31.138 --> 12:33.073
Look. Vino.

12:33.140 --> 12:37.010
A chateau Le Rouge crimson
Ruby rose Bordeaux, 1911.

12:37.078 --> 12:40.080
There's only one restaurant in town
that has a wine list extensive enough

12:40.147 --> 12:41.581
To include that vintage...

12:41.649 --> 12:44.484
The crab net of Dr. Calimari.

12:44.552 --> 12:47.153
Dr. Calimari's has
a very strict dress code.

12:47.221 --> 12:49.255
If we're going to get in,
we'll have to look the part.

12:49.323 --> 12:51.491
I think it's time for you
to leave, sheriff.

12:51.559 --> 12:56.296
- Now, Mrs. Blake, all I did was suggest
that you're dressing up like a she-vamp

12:56.364 --> 13:01.134
And stealing random objects.
No reason to get all mad about it.

13:01.202 --> 13:03.470
Mom? What's going on?

13:03.537 --> 13:07.474
The sheriff thinks I have something
to do with these vampire attacks.

13:07.541 --> 13:10.210
Thank goodness Sheila was here.

13:10.277 --> 13:11.411
- Aah!
- Yikes!

13:11.479 --> 13:14.514
Oh, Nan, don't you worry
your flawlessly skinned,

13:14.582 --> 13:16.449
Perfectly coiffed head
about this.

13:16.517 --> 13:19.719
It's just a misunderstanding.

13:21.055 --> 13:24.924
My mom is not behind this!
We have to clear her name.

13:24.992 --> 13:27.994
Guys, let's go to dinner.

13:42.443 --> 13:45.712
Welcome to the crab net
of Dr. Calimari.

13:45.780 --> 13:49.716
Bon sweer.
My chums and I would like your finest table,

13:49.784 --> 13:53.653
But first we need to
inspect your, uh, wine cellar.

13:53.721 --> 13:55.655
Oui, oui? Oui, oui?

13:55.723 --> 13:57.657
Oui, oui. Oui, oui.

13:57.725 --> 13:59.959
Do you have a reservation?

14:01.695 --> 14:04.130
No reservation, no table.

14:06.133 --> 14:09.469
Like, uh, I need
to use your bathroom, my good man.

14:09.537 --> 14:10.970
Oui, oui!

14:11.038 --> 14:12.472
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.407
Oui, oui! Oui, oui!

14:14.475 --> 14:15.975
I'm good.

14:16.043 --> 14:17.977
I went before we left.
Ooh!

14:18.045 --> 14:20.980
Oh, yeah. Ahem. Bathroom.
Right. Oui, oui.

14:21.048 --> 14:23.416
Me, too. Oui, oui.
Oui, oui.

14:23.484 --> 14:26.986
Of course. It's just
down the hall.

14:27.054 --> 14:30.390
- Oui, oui.
- Oui, oui.

14:36.997 --> 14:40.667
What is my mom doing here?
And how did she beat us?

14:42.336 --> 14:44.938
There's the wine cellar.
Let's go.

14:45.005 --> 14:47.440
Like, where is everybody going?

14:47.508 --> 14:49.442
I really have to use
the bathroom.

14:49.510 --> 14:51.077
Yipe!

14:52.613 --> 14:55.748
Listen, if we're gonna find
that bottle, we better split up.

14:55.816 --> 14:58.418
Velma, you and shaggy...
I don't like my partner.

14:58.486 --> 15:01.488
Really? Well, like, I'm tired
of being your guilt bucket.

15:01.555 --> 15:03.356
I want a new partner, too.

15:03.424 --> 15:07.060
Guys, we have to work as a team if we're
gonna catch Daphne's mom in the act

15:07.127 --> 15:10.697
And prove once and for all that
she's an undead bloodsucker.

15:10.764 --> 15:12.732
- Fred!
- Face it, gang.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.335
Maybe we're not a team anymore.

15:22.810 --> 15:25.245
- Ditto on that "uh-oh."

15:27.314 --> 15:29.649
Yipe! Yipe!

15:30.651 --> 15:32.986
That wine will be mine!

15:35.322 --> 15:36.656
Yipe!

15:41.929 --> 15:44.364
Everybody, in here!

15:44.431 --> 15:46.466
No!

16:02.016 --> 16:03.850
Fools.

16:07.087 --> 16:09.455
"everybody, in here!"
nice.

16:09.523 --> 16:12.425
How was I supposed to know
we'd get locked in by your mom?

16:12.493 --> 16:16.696
It's a cage, Fred! You always want
to stay on the outside of a cage!

16:16.764 --> 16:18.998
And that's not my mom...
Ah!

16:19.066 --> 16:21.334
I don't think.

16:21.402 --> 16:23.836
One more ingredient

16:23.904 --> 16:27.574
And I will have
eternal youth forever!

16:31.578 --> 16:34.514
Like, man, we are
totally off our game.

16:34.581 --> 16:36.182
Seriously.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.117
The final ingredient
in the recipe is

16:38.185 --> 16:41.587
A priceless cursed Ruby
called the devil's eye.

16:41.655 --> 16:44.090
I know that jewel.
It's gorgeous.

16:44.158 --> 16:48.294
It's also on display at the Darrow
university oddities museum.

16:48.362 --> 16:50.430
Then that's where we'll be.

17:15.155 --> 17:18.523
Ok, so my last trap was
a complete failure,

17:18.592 --> 17:21.527
But this one is so complicated,
it's got to work.

17:21.595 --> 17:24.564
Something about this
just doesn't make sense.

17:24.631 --> 17:27.867
If vampires don't age, why bother
with an eternal youth potion?

17:28.936 --> 17:31.371
Here we go.
Get ready, everybody.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.844
Oh, no. Mom, it is you!

17:37.911 --> 17:41.447
Daphne, for trap's sake, we're
in the middle of something here!

17:41.515 --> 17:44.083
Mom? Mom!

18:05.639 --> 18:08.074
I want that Ruby!

18:08.142 --> 18:09.876
Mom, stop this!

18:11.145 --> 18:12.378
The devil's eye!

18:12.446 --> 18:14.881
Finally I will have
the eternal youth

18:14.948 --> 18:16.516
Of a vampire!

18:17.684 --> 18:20.186
Oh, I don't think so,
ghoulfriend.

18:20.254 --> 18:22.688
I switched the rubies
when we got here.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.590
That one is a fake.

18:24.658 --> 18:27.326
Deploy the second net.

18:41.809 --> 18:43.209
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

18:44.478 --> 18:45.912
Let me go!

18:45.979 --> 18:47.580
I'll drain you all!

18:47.648 --> 18:50.550
Mom! Your vampiring is
tearing this family apart!

18:50.617 --> 18:52.618
I'm sorry, but
you've left me no choice.

18:52.686 --> 18:54.987
I'm going to have to stake you.

18:55.055 --> 18:57.757
Wait! I'm not a vampire!

18:57.825 --> 18:58.991
I'm...

18:59.059 --> 19:01.127
Sheila Altoonian?

19:01.195 --> 19:02.995
But why?

19:03.063 --> 19:06.165
Isn't it obvious?
My looks are starting to fade.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.234
- No.
- No. You're gorgeous.

19:08.302 --> 19:10.169
Your skin is
as tight as my ascot.

19:10.237 --> 19:12.104
This is all
your mother's fault.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.740
We're the same age,
but she's so beautiful.

19:14.808 --> 19:16.642
She has the skin of a teenager.

19:16.710 --> 19:18.744
That's when I realized

19:18.812 --> 19:21.781
She must be a vampire.

19:21.849 --> 19:25.151
I went to the dinkley shop
to do a little research

19:25.219 --> 19:28.154
And found the recipe
for the youth juice.

19:28.222 --> 19:33.125
That potion was gonna make me
young and beautiful forever.

19:33.193 --> 19:38.631
You see, in college I majored in zoology and
acrobatics, studying the habits of flying squirrels.

19:38.699 --> 19:42.635
I propelled myself into the air
with my quad and glute muscles.

19:42.703 --> 19:47.073
All this gave me the illusion of
a real flying vampire.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.142
Why didn't you just try maybe
wearing a little less makeup?

19:50.210 --> 19:51.811
Or a cuter haircut?

19:51.879 --> 19:54.814
Or use tape to pull back
all your wrinkly sacks of...

19:54.882 --> 19:57.550
you know, age gracefully.

19:57.618 --> 20:01.320
Age gracefully?
Are you crazy?

20:01.388 --> 20:04.257
No, the vampire serum
was my only hope,

20:04.324 --> 20:07.560
And I would have gotten away with
it if it wasn't for you meddling...

20:07.628 --> 20:10.129
What's going on here?

20:10.197 --> 20:11.564
Mom!

20:11.632 --> 20:13.699
Even now, she's stealing
my moment.

20:13.767 --> 20:17.203
I'm so glad you're not
an undead creature of darkness.

20:17.271 --> 20:18.538
Thanks, honey.

20:18.605 --> 20:20.039
But what are you doing here?

20:20.107 --> 20:21.774
Why have you been sneaking out?

20:21.842 --> 20:24.243
I didn't want to say
anything, but...

20:24.311 --> 20:28.381
I've been taking night classes.
I'm getting my public notary degree!

20:28.448 --> 20:31.817
- Oh, how exciting.
- What an opportunity.

20:31.885 --> 20:35.187
You know, I may be outrageously
gorgeous, but knowledge,

20:35.255 --> 20:38.524
Knowledge is the key
to true beauty.

20:38.592 --> 20:40.726
Well, I better get going.

20:40.794 --> 20:44.830
I have to figure out what a notary
is before tomorrow's final exam.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.341
Another mystery solved.

20:55.409 --> 20:57.310
Yeah.

20:57.377 --> 21:00.179
Well, see you guys,

21:00.247 --> 21:02.415
I guess.

21:04.351 --> 21:06.786
Yeah. Heh. I, uh,

21:06.853 --> 21:08.788
Better call it a night, so, uh,

21:08.855 --> 21:11.190
Trap you later.

21:12.426 --> 21:16.228
- Listen, Velma, I'm...
- good night, Norville.

21:19.866 --> 21:22.702
Looks like it's just me
and you, Scooby doo.

21:22.769 --> 21:26.505
Yeah. It'll be OK.
You'll see.
