ELAINE:

06:13.123 --> 06:15.042
It was just such

06:13.123 --> 06:15.042
a great night.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.127
Oh!

06:15.042 --> 06:17.127
And did they suspect anything?

06:17.127 --> 06:18.337
Mmm.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.463
No, I was a fantastic beard.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.175
I held hands,

06:20.463 --> 06:23.175
I called him "honey."

06:23.175 --> 06:26.303
And we discover

06:23.175 --> 06:26.303
yet another talent:

06:26.303 --> 06:30.182
posing as a girlfriend

06:26.303 --> 06:30.182
for homosexuals.

06:30.182 --> 06:34.102
Oh, it was just

06:30.182 --> 06:34.102
such a great night.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.270
You said that already.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.521
Oh, I did?

06:36.521 --> 06:37.522
Yeah.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.565
Oh.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.737
Oh, no.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.115
Don't tell me.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.658
You like him?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.327
He's incredible!

06:51.703 --> 06:53.454
Yeah, but--

06:53.454 --> 06:55.665
Yeah. I-- I know.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.624
So?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.625
What?

06:57.625 --> 06:59.418
Not conversion?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.964
You're thinking conversion?

07:02.964 --> 07:05.842
Well, it did occur to me.

07:05.842 --> 07:08.178
You think you can get him

07:05.842 --> 07:08.178
to just change teams?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.847
He's not gonna suddenly

07:08.178 --> 07:10.847
switch sides.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.057
Forget about it.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.892
Why? Is it irrevocable?

07:13.892 --> 07:17.437
Because when you join that team,

07:13.892 --> 07:17.437
it's not a whim.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.855
He likes his team.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.649
He's set with that team.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.818
But we've got a good team.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.112
Yeah, we do.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.696
We do have a good team.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.366
Well, why can't he play for us?

07:31.118 --> 07:34.996
They're only comfortable

07:31.118 --> 07:34.996
with<i> their</i> equipment.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.628
But we just got along so great.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.671
Of course, you did.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.671
Everyone gets along great

07:43.671 --> 07:45.215
when there's

07:43.671 --> 07:45.215
no possibility of sex.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.217
No, no, no.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.217
I sensed something.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.551
I did sense something.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.720
I perceived

07:48.551 --> 07:50.720
a possibility, Jerry.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.769
You realize your venturing

07:54.433 --> 07:57.769
into uncharted waters.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.438
I realize that.

07:59.438 --> 08:02.065
Are you that desperate?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.067
Yes, I am.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.570
JERRY:

08:05.652 --> 08:07.570
Are you gonna bring your gun?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.826
Yeah, I think

08:10.573 --> 08:12.826
you should leave it at home.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.953
Well, I don't really

08:12.826 --> 08:14.953
know you that well.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.164
What if we get into a fight

08:14.953 --> 08:17.164
or something?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.706
You know, you lose your temper.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.417
Who knows

08:18.706 --> 08:20.417
what you're capable of.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.085
All right,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.085
then it's settled.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.213
First date, no weapons.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.048
All right.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.048
I'll see you then.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.258
Okay, bye.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.886
Yeah, yeah.

Here we go.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.641

Sorry, I don't have

08:36.641 --> 08:39.019
any Tupperware.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.770
See, I knew

08:39.019 --> 08:40.770
this was gonna happen.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.897
I just made

08:40.770 --> 08:42.897
a delicious casserole,

08:42.897 --> 08:45.608
but now it won't keep

08:42.897 --> 08:45.608
'cause I have no Tupperware!

08:45.608 --> 08:47.444
What about a plastic bag?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.029
You must be kidding.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.405
What is the difference?

08:50.405 --> 08:51.656
The patented burp, Jerry.

08:51.656 --> 08:53.867
It locks in freshness.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.372
Hey-oh.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.372
Hey.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.249
So, I, uh...

09:01.249 --> 09:03.710
I spoke to your little

09:01.249 --> 09:03.710
friend Denise last night.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.045
Oh, yeah.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.045
You talked, huh?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.254
Yeah. For two hours.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.547
She's nuts about you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
Yeah, well, we go

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
way back, you know.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.926
Why didn't anything ever happen

09:09.549 --> 09:11.926
between you two?

09:11.926 --> 09:13.428
Who's to say it didn't?

09:13.428 --> 09:14.637
Chk!

09:16.264 --> 09:18.725
So did you describe yourself

09:16.264 --> 09:18.725
to her over the phone?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.477
Yes, I did.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.436
What did you say?

09:21.436 --> 09:23.104
What do you think I said?

09:23.104 --> 09:24.481
I don't know.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.566
I told her the truth.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.901
As you see it.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.780
Yes, as I see it.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.451
Did you tell her about

09:32.780 --> 09:36.451
your little hat there?

09:37.494 --> 09:38.870
What hat?

09:38.870 --> 09:41.664
You know, your little

09:38.870 --> 09:41.664
hair hat there.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.167
No.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.960
Don't you think she could tell?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.546
No, no, no.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.546
She can't tell.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.714
It's a perfect match.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.714
Beautiful job.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.091
Are you kiddin'?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.552
I could spot that bird's nest

09:51.091 --> 09:53.552
two blocks away.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.555
You only think that

09:53.552 --> 09:56.555
because you know me.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.681
Have you noticed

09:56.555 --> 09:58.681
people staring at your head?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.100
I notice people

09:58.681 --> 10:00.100
staring at my head

10:00.100 --> 10:02.394
because they like what they see.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.937
I think you should

10:02.394 --> 10:03.937
either take it off

10:03.937 --> 10:04.979
or tell her about it.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.231
He's not gonna

10:04.979 --> 10:06.231
take it off.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.482
If he was gonna

10:06.231 --> 10:07.482
go over bald,

10:07.482 --> 10:08.900
I wouldn't have

10:07.482 --> 10:08.900
introduced them.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.528
All right, look.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.528
I guarantee she won't know.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.653
Yeah. That's it.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.988
I'm gonna go down

I'm gonna have lunch

Sure. I will.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.797
He did. And it made him

22:17.878 --> 22:19.797
act like a jerk.

22:19.797 --> 22:20.965
All right. Shut up,

22:19.797 --> 22:20.965
shut up.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.341
<i>Melrose Place</i> is coming on.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.802
[THEME FROM<i> MELROSE PLACE</i>

22:22.341 --> 22:24.802
PLAYING]

22:28.889 --> 22:30.599
Oh, that Michael.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.599
I hate him.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.476
He's just so smug.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.865
How you doin', Stu?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.950
Eddie, my man.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.287
You again?

22:51.287 --> 22:53.289
Boy, you're a slippery one.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.541
You better straighten up

22:53.289 --> 22:55.541
and fly right, buddy boy.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.043
What do you got?

22:57.043 --> 22:59.377
I got an eye witness to

22:57.043 --> 22:59.377
that jewelry store break-in.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.838
Come here.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.758
Do you recognize anybody

23:02.673 --> 23:04.758
in this line-up?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.222
That's the guy, officer!

23:09.222 --> 23:12.432
The guy there in the middle,

23:09.222 --> 23:12.432
the tall guy with the high hair.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.227
I'd recognize him anywhere.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.435
Hey, you.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.770
<i>You with the high hair.</i>

23:16.770 --> 23:18.480
<i>Step forward.</i>

23:19.982 --> 23:22.068
Me?
