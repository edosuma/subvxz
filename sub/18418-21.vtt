WEBVTT

00:00.460 --> 00:02.120
- Previously, on "Nashville"...

00:02.120 --> 00:04.000
- Wanna talk about this song?
I got a little studio time

00:04.000 --> 00:05.830
if you want to get in
and lay it down.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.120
- Brand partnerships.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.120
The best kind of integration
is entirely frictionless.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.540
- All we are asking is that
you give this a chance.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.790
- We need to talk.

00:13.790 --> 00:15.500
Billy put together
a tour for me.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.420
- You're gonna do this without
even talking to me.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.880
- This is something that's been
building in me for a long time.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.790
- What about us?
- I'm not breaking up with you.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.500
It's a tour.
- I don't want you to leave.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.000
- Scarlett and I
are taking some time.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.250
I don't know what
to do with myself.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.290
- You could play
some shows with us.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.460
Or just come along for the ride.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.670
(cell phone chimes)

00:40.960 --> 00:42.790
(cell phone continues chiming)

01:03.960 --> 01:06.580
- Maddie?
You awake?

01:06.580 --> 01:09.170
- Yes.
I'm getting up.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.120
- We'll be late!
Let's go!

01:11.120 --> 01:12.500
- All right.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.880
- Let's see if this'll work.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.620
- Do I have to wear this thing?

01:16.620 --> 01:18.210
- You'll be very happy
you're wearing a wetsuit

01:18.210 --> 01:20.040
out there, believe me.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.420
It's gonna get mighty cold
when they turn the water on.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.330
- How do they not see it?

01:23.330 --> 01:25.080
- We cut it.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.040
- (groans)
That dress is beautiful!

01:29.040 --> 01:30.250
- Do they have to curl
my hair so much?

01:30.250 --> 01:32.000
It really does not
feel like me.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.920
- Oh, my God,
you're like breathtaking!

01:33.920 --> 01:35.420
- No, no. That's the suit.
I literally cannot breathe.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.670
- This is so exciting.

01:36.670 --> 01:38.290
Your first song
is in a commercial.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.830
Think about how many people
are going to hear it.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.380
- Yeah...ow!

01:41.380 --> 01:42.380
- Great dress!

01:42.380 --> 01:44.500
- God, look at your hair!

01:44.500 --> 01:46.250
- Cooper? Leslie?
Miss Maddie Jaymes.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.420
- These are for you.
- Thank you.

01:48.420 --> 01:50.580
- We are so psyched that you
are the face of Mascara 24.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.500
- Thank you.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.460
- And don't forget about the
party tonight at Charlie Mae's.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.580
It would mean so much
to the New York folks.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.420
- Yes. Sounds like fun.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.120
- Hey.
Maddie excited?

02:08.120 --> 02:09.750
- Yeah.
I mean, I guess so.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.580
She's never really done
anything like this before.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.290
- Well, I think it's
gonna be amazing.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.040
She'll get the exposure.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.620
We get to keep working with the
hottest agency in the business.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.790
- You would know all about that.

02:18.790 --> 02:22.210
- Deacon, come on, man.
We've got momentum, okay?

02:22.210 --> 02:23.960
Highway 65 has
two nominations.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.500
We gotta keep going!

02:25.500 --> 02:27.380
- We're going!
- We're back on the map!

02:27.380 --> 02:28.830
- All right, we're on the map.
We're going.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.210
- And so are you, I hear.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.880
What's this about you
playing the Opry?

02:32.880 --> 02:34.920
- Yeah.
I might play the Opry.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.420
- Dude, you should.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.920
I mean, you're
being featured, man.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.460
I think this would be
a great thing for you.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.420
You're always helping
everybody else out.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.250
It's about time you were
the center of attention.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.620
(crowd cheering)

02:45.620 --> 02:47.170
- Thank you, San Antonio!

02:47.170 --> 02:49.210
- Whoo! Do you hear that?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.460
- You guys were amazing!

02:51.460 --> 02:52.750
- Polly, you always say that.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.330
And I always love it
when you do.

02:54.330 --> 02:55.880
- I'm serious.
You really connected tonight.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.290
You hear the audience?
The energy was crazy.

02:59.290 --> 03:02.250
Hey, guys! Can we not
break the amps, please?

03:02.250 --> 03:06.040
- Sorry, Polly.
(cell phone rings)

03:06.040 --> 03:08.250
Babe! Hey!
- I just got her down.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.460
I think she's coming
down with a cold.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.120
Which means
I'm gonna get a cold.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.750
And I'm supposed to be
in a recording studio.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.540
- Okay, listen...
Everything's gonna be fine.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.460
Just take some of those herbs
that I left for you.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.880
Can I call you right back?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.380
My album will just be horrible.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.000
Our child will have pneumonia.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.920
You just go have fun.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.960
- She's gonna be fine
and so are you.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.920
Blow Cadence a kiss for me,
all right?

03:29.920 --> 03:31.880
I love you both.
Don't forget that.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.420
- (sighs)

03:36.080 --> 03:38.380
- I'm so tired.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.920
Why do I have to do this?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.170
- 'Cause you're the star.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.290
- Daphne, they
literally tried on

03:43.290 --> 03:44.750
a million different
dresses on me

03:44.750 --> 03:46.290
and makeup tests.

03:46.290 --> 03:49.040
And none of them were ever
satisfied with anything.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.670
Oh, my God, now I have to
show you this suit

03:50.670 --> 03:52.500
I have to wear underneath
to keep me dry.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.460
- That is so cool.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.290
- So cool?
- Yes.

03:57.290 --> 03:58.880
- Okay, here we go.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.380
We're just gonna pour
some rain on Daphne...

04:00.380 --> 04:02.040
- No, Maddie! Maddie! Don't!
- No, no, no...

04:02.040 --> 04:04.790
You're having way too much
fun in here tonight.

04:04.790 --> 04:06.460
- I'm having fun.

04:06.460 --> 04:07.710
Maddie's far too busy
complaining.

04:07.710 --> 04:09.420
- Shut up.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.880
Why do I have to do this, Dad?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.580
- Because, my sweet,
you are the star.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.120
- See?

04:14.120 --> 04:15.290
- They're turning me
into this character.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.540
It's like it's not even me.

04:16.540 --> 04:17.580
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

04:17.580 --> 04:19.880
It won't be much longer.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.540
Think of all the people
who get to hear your music.

04:21.540 --> 04:22.920
Hurry up and go to your party.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.580
And you, I'm sorry, my dear,

04:24.580 --> 04:26.250
need to hurry up
and go to bed.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.670
- Do you want to come
to this party with me?

04:27.670 --> 04:29.250
- Maddie, I wish I could.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.040
I'm just wiped out
and I got more work

04:32.040 --> 04:33.420
that I got to get through
before I go to bed even.

04:33.420 --> 04:35.500
- Daddy, you work too hard.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.830
You just need to have some fun.
Just like you always tell us.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.330
- One fun thing did come up.

04:42.330 --> 04:43.960
- Really?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.540
- I got asked to play the Opry.

04:45.540 --> 04:48.330
- That's awesome.
- That's cool. With who?

04:48.330 --> 04:49.750
- With myself.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.040
- Like as a featured performer?
- In the circle?

04:52.040 --> 04:53.330
- Yeah.
- What?

04:53.330 --> 04:55.120
That's amazing.
- Oh, my God!

04:55.120 --> 04:56.620
- Well, it was real nice
for them to ask.

04:56.620 --> 04:59.420
- Well, you're gonna do it,
right?

04:59.420 --> 05:00.710
- I don't know.
I got a lot going on right now.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.330
Please go to sleep.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.040
Please tell me
you're not wearing that.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.290
- No. It's not what I'm wearing.
- (laughs)

05:08.670 --> 05:11.040
- Look at that face!

05:11.040 --> 05:13.170
- My daughter loves you!
- Really? Thank you.

05:13.170 --> 05:15.670
- You are so poised
for your age.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.670
- Isn't she?
How are you holding up?

05:17.670 --> 05:18.960
- Just really tired.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.500
- Yeah, well,
just hang in there.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
I'll get you out soon, girl.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.120
(clinks glass)

05:24.120 --> 05:26.580
- I'd like to say that
we are incredibly thrilled

05:26.580 --> 05:28.500
to have the young Maddie Jaymes

05:28.500 --> 05:30.380
as the face of Mascara 24.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.460
We hope this is the beginning
of a beautiful relationship.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.040
Welcome to the family, Maddie.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.540
- Thank you.
- Yeah, Maddie!

05:36.540 --> 05:38.460
- The CEO came out just for you.

05:38.460 --> 05:41.790
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.830
- And now he wants
to talk to me.

05:43.830 --> 05:45.500
What could that be about?

05:45.500 --> 05:47.330
These people are so annoying.
- I know.

05:47.330 --> 05:48.620
I love your top.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.040
Hey, what's up?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.460
- I'm sorry about
this song of hers.

05:55.460 --> 05:57.380
- It tested great.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.420
- I don't see a connection
with our mascara.

05:59.420 --> 06:02.620
- A tidal wave
can't wash it off.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.580
- And how will people know that?

06:04.580 --> 06:06.120
- 'Cause they'll hear it
in the song.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.460
- They won't hear
our mascara in the song.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.750
- Because the song
is about a tidal wave.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.330
- At $800,000 a minute,

06:13.330 --> 06:16.290
maybe it should
be a song about mascara.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.040
(crowd chanting)
- Maddie! Maddie!

06:22.040 --> 06:24.080
- Sing us a song!
- Excuse me!

06:25.750 --> 06:30.330
- Maddie! Maddie! Maddie...
would love to sing.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.120
But she has a sore throat.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.920
So I need to get her home,
you guys.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.830
- Yeah, you don't want
her to get sick, right?

06:35.830 --> 06:38.460
- No, no. She will see you
all on set tomorrow, okay?

06:38.460 --> 06:39.710
- Feel better!
- Perfect.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.420
- What about you, Alyssa?

06:41.420 --> 06:42.710
- Oh, perfect!
Come on, Alyssa!

06:42.710 --> 06:45.080
- Oh, no.
I don't sing, you guys.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.330
I don't sing.
- Just one!

06:47.330 --> 06:48.920
- No, I don't sing.
- Come on, come on!

06:48.920 --> 06:51.710
- Alyssa! Alyssa!
Alyssa!

06:51.710 --> 06:54.750
- We know everybody
in Nashville sings.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.580
I'm from Seattle.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.790
Okay, okay, oh my God.
(crowd cheers)

07:02.330 --> 07:06.290
I'm only doing this
because...margarita!

07:08.040 --> 07:09.750
"You don't know me."
The song?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.710
No cell phones, okay?

07:13.710 --> 07:15.500
I will throw all of them
in the fountain outside.

my mind around the fact

10:05.620 --> 10:07.460

10:07.460 --> 10:09.080

Quick break.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.540

you're playing the Opry.

10:11.540 --> 10:14.210

at the last minute.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.880

Wow.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.250
You're even worse than I am.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.420
Who second-guesses
an invite to play the Opry?

10:20.420 --> 10:22.170

It's really amazing.

I just don't know
when I'm gonna find the time

10:25.040 --> 10:28.080

Highway 65, not so much.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.750

- I keep telling myself
I'm doing it for the girls

10:46.670 --> 10:51.040
and for the artists, but...

10:51.040 --> 10:52.960
in the end, I just wish
I could talk to her,

10:52.960 --> 10:54.120
you know, like we used to.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.040
All right, let's get back to it.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.710
- Okay.
Well, I'm happy for you.

11:02.710 --> 11:04.830
- For what?
(phone dings)

11:04.830 --> 11:06.420
- For playing the Opry.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.080

11:15.080 --> 11:16.620
Why'd you do that?

11:16.620 --> 11:18.290
- That's so funny
when that happens.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.290
- He's the doctor.
You should do what he says.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.460
- Great.
All right.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.830
- All right, whatever.

11:22.830 --> 11:25.170

Don't do this.

11:30.830 --> 11:32.620
- Love you, babe.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.790
Everything okay?

11:36.790 --> 11:40.170
- Uh, what's the opposite
of okay?

11:40.170 --> 11:43.290
- That is called
being on the road.

11:43.290 --> 11:45.830
- It's just hard
when you're not there.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.330
- Yeah, it is.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.960
- Thanks.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.540
I don't know. I just--

11:50.540 --> 11:52.710
I can't keep fixing it
for her, you know.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.120
- Why do you have to?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.080
- It's part of

11:56.080 --> 11:58.330
- Oh, so it's a job.

11:58.330 --> 12:01.040

You have nothing to worry about.

receptive to our new idea.

- Idea?

14:00.580 --> 14:03.000

about the song.

at the party, but...

- It's really an easy fix.

Instead of "got me racing my
heart now and I'm fading out,"

14:11.670 --> 14:15.540
she sings "I got my Mascara 24
and I'm not fading out."

14:17.540 --> 14:20.420
- It just makes everything so
much clearer, don't you think?

14:20.420 --> 14:23.120
- Absolutely.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.040
I just don't know
that Maddie's gonna be okay

14:25.040 --> 14:27.250

about this idea.

14:30.790 --> 14:34.210
And once he's over the moon...

14:34.210 --> 14:35.790
- We need you
to make her okay with it.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.540
- I'll see what I can do.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.380
- Yeah. Great.

get the changes

14:42.790 --> 14:44.040

14:44.040 --> 14:45.290
- Yes, I did.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.580

that one right now?

14:46.580 --> 14:48.170
- Yes, please.
That would be great.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.000

- Take your time.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.330

14:52.330 --> 14:54.500
- Hey, I know you're super busy.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.040
But you may need
to go talk to Maddie.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.040
- What's wrong?
- Well, they want to make

14:58.040 --> 15:00.080
a little change with the lyrics,
and she's upset about it.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.080
- What changes?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.620
- I don't even know!

15:02.620 --> 15:04.420
I just know it's
literally a couple of words.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.120
And the client's freaking out.

15:06.120 --> 15:08.000
- Zach, calm down, all right?
Now, how's Maddie?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.040
- She had a total meltdown.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.580
The director sent her
home for the day.

15:12.580 --> 15:14.620
- All right, I'm on my way.

15:14.620 --> 15:16.960
- Look, Deacon,
I know this is your daughter.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.420
But please remember
that the client

15:18.420 --> 15:20.080
has a couple of million
dollars into this deal.

15:20.080 --> 15:23.420
And we cannot have another
Birch Tree Habitat fiasco!

15:23.420 --> 15:25.710
- I said I'm on my way,
all right?

15:27.210 --> 15:28.750
Guys, I'm sorry.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.420
I appreciate y'all being
here for me--I gotta go.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.380
It's my daughter.
Can you finish up without me?

15:32.380 --> 15:33.830
- Yeah. We got it covered.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.080
Just do what you gotta do.

15:35.080 --> 15:36.420
- Thank you, Michael.
Thank you.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.290
(knock on door )

15:40.290 --> 15:42.120
- Maddie, it's Dad.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.580
- Come in.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.000
Please don't make me do this.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.500
- Sweetheart, this is not me
making you do this, all right?

16:03.500 --> 16:06.120
This is me trying
to help you understand

16:06.120 --> 16:07.790
that being a grown-up
means sometimes

16:07.790 --> 16:10.380
having to do things
that we don't want to do.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.080
- But I don't want
to be a grown-up.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.080
- Yeah, me either.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.710
- Have you heard what
they want to change it to?

16:17.710 --> 16:20.500
It's beyond stupid.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.880
My songs,
they're all that I have.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.380
- I know this feels
like selling out.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.710
But, baby, everybody
goes through this.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.830
This is part of the business.
Now more and ever--

16:29.830 --> 16:32.670
- It's my song.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.920
The song--it literally came
from the bottom of my heart!

16:35.920 --> 16:39.920
Every single note
was a piece of me.

16:39.920 --> 16:42.460
And you more than anyone
should understand that, Dad!

16:45.670 --> 16:49.290
- I do, baby.

16:50.380 --> 16:53.170
I actually do.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.880
- Deacon!
Just the man I wanted to see.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.250
- Good, because we got to talk
about this damn commercial.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.790
- I realize this is
a difficult situation for you.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.500
But I need you to understand

17:03.500 --> 17:04.830
that everything
we are asking of Maddie

17:04.830 --> 17:06.960
is in her best interest
as an artist.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.880
- All due respect, Zach,

17:08.880 --> 17:11.250
this is my daughter's
first big song.

17:11.250 --> 17:14.580
How the world hears it, that
will shape her whole career.

17:14.580 --> 17:16.210
- That's what I'm saying.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.540
Brad Paisley,
"Nationwide is on Your Side"?

17:17.540 --> 17:19.330
It didn't hurt his career,
Deacon.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.710
- Well, Brad is
an established artist.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.790
- But, Deacon,
this would launch her.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.290
- Maddie does not agree.

17:25.290 --> 17:28.210
Neither do I.

17:28.210 --> 17:29.330
- Are you seriously
talking about

17:29.330 --> 17:30.670
Maddie breaching her contract?

17:30.670 --> 17:32.290
- No, Alyssa.

17:32.290 --> 17:34.000
I'm saying this was never part
of the deal, all right?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.710
If anybody should be blamed,
it's these jokers

17:35.710 --> 17:37.710
for changing the game
while we're playing it.

17:37.710 --> 17:40.420
- Actually, you're wrong.

17:40.420 --> 17:43.500
"The undersigned hereby

17:55.880 --> 17:58.750
- Who agreed to this language?

17:58.750 --> 18:00.580
- You did.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.830
You signed it.
It's standard boilerplate.

18:02.830 --> 18:04.880
They wouldn't accept
anything less.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.290
It's how these
companies operate.

18:06.290 --> 18:09.880
- (sighs)

18:09.880 --> 18:12.380
Then you lied to us, Zach.

18:12.380 --> 18:13.960
- I lied to you?
- Yeah.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.830
You did not pitch
this the way it is at all.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.620
- Oh, this is my fault?

18:17.620 --> 18:20.710
- This is not how any of this
was pitched by you.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.420
- You never really believed that

18:23.420 --> 18:26.080
I have Highway 65's best
interest at heart, have you?

18:26.080 --> 18:27.460
- Oh, my God,
I supported you, Zach.

18:27.460 --> 18:28.750
Even when I didn't
understand you.

18:28.750 --> 18:29.960
- Only because
Rayna wanted you to.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.420
- That's true.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.710
What the hell does that
have to do with right now?

18:32.710 --> 18:35.080
- I'm so tired!

18:35.080 --> 18:37.460
I've done everything I can
to keep this company going!

18:37.460 --> 18:39.880
And all anyone ever does
is give me a hard time!

18:39.880 --> 18:42.710
And I've never held
this over you, Deacon, but...

18:42.710 --> 18:45.500
- What?

18:45.500 --> 18:48.580
- I can't keep pushing
the boulder up the hill!

18:48.580 --> 18:50.830
It's hard for me to say this.

18:50.830 --> 18:54.960
But if you can't get Maddie
in line, I'm done.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.830
- Done how, Zach?
- Out.

18:57.830 --> 18:59.580
O-U-T, done.

18:59.580 --> 19:03.000
I will give you my 90-day
notice as per our contract.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.620
And at the end of that 90 days,

19:05.620 --> 19:08.500

- Sure.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.120
- Woo! Haha...
- Mmm.

20:51.120 --> 20:54.290
(cell phone rings)

20:54.290 --> 20:55.670
- It's cool man,
you can take it.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.670
- Nah, just gonna
be another fight.

20:58.670 --> 21:01.540
Yep. Being gone sure does
shake stuff up.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.210
- Maybe that's a good thing.

21:03.210 --> 21:05.500
Sometimes it can help you see
things more clearly.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.040
- Like all the stuff
you did wrong?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.460
- Yeah, or how hard it is?

21:09.460 --> 21:11.830
- Geez, you guys,

21:11.830 --> 21:12.960
you got to trust
that your partners

21:12.960 --> 21:14.880
can take care of themselves.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.380
You don't always have to solve
every single thing for them.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.920
- Relationships are about being
there when they need you.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.420
- Constantly?
What about your freedom?

21:27.420 --> 21:28.790
- What do you mean, freedom?

21:28.790 --> 21:30.460
- I think you know
what I mean by freedom.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.330
- Just another word?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.540
- At least my boyfriend
and I are realistic.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.790
If we're not in the same town,
we figure it out.

21:38.790 --> 21:41.000
We don't ask each
other questions.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.040
- Okay, Bobby McGee.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.460
- Avery, you take care of her.

21:44.460 --> 21:46.080
You're there for her constantly.

21:46.080 --> 21:49.210
You solve every single mess
she gets herself into.

21:49.210 --> 21:53.250
What if just for once
you didn't?

21:53.250 --> 21:55.790
- So I'm supposed
to pick and choose

21:55.790 --> 21:57.830
what times I'm there for her?

21:57.830 --> 22:00.670
- I think I'm gonna
head back to the hotel.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.170
If you need me for anything,
I'm gonna be at the bar.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.620
- Whoa.

22:16.620 --> 22:17.960
- What do you mean, whoa?

22:17.960 --> 22:19.120
- What do you mean,
what do I mean?

22:19.120 --> 22:20.710
It's obvious.

22:20.710 --> 22:23.290
- No way.
- Yes, way.

22:23.290 --> 22:27.210
She's, you know,
into being happy.

22:27.210 --> 22:29.040
(chuckles)

22:29.040 --> 22:30.500
- She was looking at you.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.670
- No, she was
definitely looking at you.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.620
- Anybody?
- I'll take some.

22:41.620 --> 22:44.170
- Quiet night last night?

22:44.170 --> 22:46.580
- Yeah.

22:46.580 --> 22:49.290
- So thank y'all
for joining me here.

22:49.290 --> 22:50.620
I wanted to catch
everybody up to speed

22:50.620 --> 22:52.460
on what's going on
with Highway 65.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.040
Juliette and Hallie are sorry
they couldn't be here.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.460
I'll be talking
to them individually.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.330
- What's wrong?

22:58.330 --> 23:00.580
- Well, right now it's about
Maddie's commercial.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.500
A client is asking...

23:03.500 --> 23:07.670
demanding to change
the lyrics to her song.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.000
- They can't do that,
though, right?

23:09.000 --> 23:11.250
- It turns out they can.

23:11.250 --> 23:14.710
Zach sold this whole thing to us
as some kind of experiment.

23:14.710 --> 23:16.830
Where we could go along with it
as far as we were comfortable.

23:16.830 --> 23:20.960
But it's looking like
that is not the truth.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.040
- So what are our options?

23:23.040 --> 23:25.420
- I think right now is the time

23:25.420 --> 23:27.210
we have to figure out
what it is we believe.

23:27.210 --> 23:31.000
And how much we are willing
to sacrifice for it.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
For Maddie, she feels like
changing the lyrics to her song

23:34.000 --> 23:37.670
undermines the integrity
of the song.

23:37.670 --> 23:38.960
And, well, of herself
as an artist.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.710
- I agree.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.380
It's one thing to sell
products for them.

23:42.380 --> 23:44.540
And it's another to change
the words to your music.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.120
They're who you are.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.620
- Yeah, no question.
This could be any one of us.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.040
That's going too far.
- I hear you both.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.120
But I feel like it's my job
to let you know

23:53.120 --> 23:54.500
where this whole
thing's gonna go

23:54.500 --> 23:56.170
if we do decide to stand firm.

23:56.170 --> 23:58.750
At this point,
Zach is out of patience.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.040
If we don't do things his way,
he is gonna walk.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.330
That'll pretty much mean
the end of Highway 65.

24:05.330 --> 24:08.290
- I'll change the words, okay?
It's really not a big deal.

24:08.290 --> 24:10.290
- Okay, no, it is a big deal.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.380
And we're not just
gonna let you do that.

24:12.380 --> 24:16.040
Whether we like it or not,
we're all in this together.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.170
- So this is about fear.

24:18.170 --> 24:20.290
- What, sweetie?

24:20.290 --> 24:23.750
- If we're afraid, we can just
do what Zach tells us to do.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.460
Or we can do what feels right.

24:26.460 --> 24:28.500
- That's beautiful, sweetheart.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.290
And there's a whole lot
of truth to it.

24:30.290 --> 24:32.460
It's just--I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

24:32.460 --> 24:34.380
- Why isn't it?

24:34.380 --> 24:35.790
What's the point of Highway 65

24:35.790 --> 24:37.790
if it isn't what
Mom wanted it to be?

24:37.790 --> 24:40.750
- Rayna signed us
'cause she loved our songs.

24:40.750 --> 24:43.080
Not 'cause she saw dollar signs.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.960
You're who Rayna trusted to
steer this company, Deacon.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.750
So it's gotta be your decision,
not ours.

24:49.750 --> 24:54.120
- I agree.
- Me too.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.500
- Whatever you decide,
we're with you.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.960
- Daphne?
I'm heading out, sweetheart.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.380
You gonna be okay?

25:06.380 --> 25:08.620
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
See you later.

25:08.620 --> 25:09.830
- All righty.

25:12.170 --> 25:16.250
How are you?
How you doing?

25:16.250 --> 25:17.920
- Highway 65
was Mom's biggest dream.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.670
- No, that's not true.
You and Daphne were.

25:20.670 --> 25:25.540
- I know that,
but she loved it so much.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.830
And I just--I cannot
be the reason it dies.

25:27.830 --> 25:31.380
- Listen to me.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.420
If this ends,
it will not be your problem.

25:33.420 --> 25:35.040
- But it kind of would be.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.880
And I just don't know
if I could live with that.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.500
- Baby, please stop
putting this on yourself.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.580
It's on me.
It's my decision.

25:43.580 --> 25:45.120
- Have you figured out
what you're gonna do yet?

25:45.120 --> 25:48.580
- Not yet.
I'm hoping it'll come to me.

25:53.290 --> 25:55.170
- What? We're all
supposed to suffer

25:55.170 --> 25:58.000
because Maddie won't budge
on a few lyrics?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.880
I practically just
got to this label.

25:59.880 --> 26:03.750
And now I'm supposed
to up-end my career.

26:03.750 --> 26:06.250
- If that's how you feel,
then that's how you feel.

26:09.380 --> 26:11.080
- I want you
to tell me how you feel.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.540
- I don't know how I feel.

26:13.540 --> 26:14.920
And that shouldn't
sway your decision.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.710
It's okay if we disagree.

26:16.710 --> 26:21.000
I think we should be more
independent sometimes, you know.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.920
- What do you mean by that?
Independent how?

26:23.920 --> 26:25.830
- I think you should
figure out how you feel.

26:25.830 --> 26:27.080
And not second-guess yourself.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.880
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.000
- Are you having an affair?
- Are you crazy?

26:31.000 --> 26:33.290
All I'm saying is you
got to do what you got to do

26:33.290 --> 26:34.830
without my input all the time.

26:34.830 --> 26:38.420
- Wow. Okay, thanks.
Thank you very much.

26:45.380 --> 26:48.580
(honks car horn)
- Hey!

26:48.580 --> 26:50.380
- What are you doing?
- Get in the car.

26:50.380 --> 26:52.250
- Jessie, I'm sorry.
I can't.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.620
I got like 10 things
I got to go to right now.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.830
- I'm not asking you, Deacon.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.330
I'm telling you. Get in.

27:12.670 --> 27:15.330
- Whatever this is,
I'm not doing it.

27:15.330 --> 27:16.880
- Just get out of the car.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.420
- Jessie, I don't
have time for this.

27:18.420 --> 27:20.000
- You do have time.
- No, I don't, Jessie.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.580
- You have one hour.

27:21.580 --> 27:22.710
- An hour for what?

27:22.710 --> 27:25.920
- An hour for yourself!

27:25.920 --> 27:28.580
You've been wound up so tight
you can't even breath!

27:28.580 --> 27:31.960
- I promise you, this is not
helping with that, all right?

27:31.960 --> 27:35.000
- Just get out of here,
all right?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.750
- See what happens and I'll be
waiting here when you get back.

27:37.750 --> 27:42.540
All right.
See you later.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.040
Bye.

29:40.210 --> 29:42.000
Not sure you were right.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.830
Hang on one sec.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.670
People keep asking
how I'm doing,

29:51.670 --> 29:54.120
you know, all the time.

29:54.120 --> 29:57.920
You okay?

29:57.920 --> 30:00.210
It's nice, but I know what
they're really saying.

30:03.710 --> 30:05.750
They're saying
when are you gonna start

30:05.750 --> 30:07.960
getting on with your life?

30:11.500 --> 30:13.380
When are you gonna
start moving on?

30:17.500 --> 30:21.330
I can't.

30:21.330 --> 30:23.880
- And maybe you never will,

30:23.880 --> 30:26.750
not completely.

30:26.750 --> 30:30.580
No one has the right to tell you
how to do this, you know.

30:30.580 --> 30:33.330
But do you think that
she would want you

30:33.330 --> 30:37.330
to be in so much pain
that you forgot yourself?

30:37.330 --> 30:38.620
Don't you think
she would want you

30:38.620 --> 30:42.500
to live this one life
right now?

30:49.040 --> 30:51.380
- That's fine. I have a--

30:51.380 --> 30:53.920
Listen, I'm gonna have to call
you right back, okay?

30:53.920 --> 30:56.750
Guys, can we have the room,
please?

30:56.750 --> 30:59.540
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Thank you.

30:59.540 --> 31:02.790
Hi.
- Hey.

31:02.790 --> 31:03.960
Have a seat.

31:08.420 --> 31:12.120
I called Alyssa too.
Asked her to join us.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.580
- Of course.

31:15.670 --> 31:20.120
- So, obviously,
we're at a crossroads here.

31:20.120 --> 31:23.170
- Well, I know there's
a way through this.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.460
There always is.

31:24.460 --> 31:27.830
- Yeah, that's the thing, Zach.

31:27.830 --> 31:30.790
I don't think
there is this time.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.670
- What do you mean?

31:32.670 --> 31:34.670
- What I mean is that
I've spoken with everybody.

31:34.670 --> 31:38.710
And we have come
to the consensus that...

31:38.710 --> 31:42.040
we're done with branding.
And all that stuff.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.170
- And that's it? You're just
gonna dismiss the whole concept?

31:44.170 --> 31:45.330
- I'm not dismissing
the concept,

31:45.330 --> 31:47.000
just not right for us right now.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.670
- Deacon, come on.
That's crazy.

31:48.670 --> 31:49.880
- We just need to feel good
about what we're doing,

31:49.880 --> 31:52.120
and the music we're making.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.920
- No, it's okay.
I get it! I get it!

31:53.920 --> 31:56.380
You're a bunch
of hopeless romantics.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.210
Artists, yeah, amazing artists.

31:58.210 --> 31:59.670
But artists are so subject to
the laws of physics, Deacon,

31:59.670 --> 32:01.500
like everybody else.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.000
So if the money goes out,
there's got to be a way for it

32:03.000 --> 32:04.880
to come back in,
or else there ain't no more!

32:04.880 --> 32:08.420
Okay? So I will say
this to you one last time.

32:08.420 --> 32:11.210
You opt out of this
and it's over!

32:15.170 --> 32:19.790
- We're just doing what
feels right to us, Zach.

32:19.790 --> 32:21.000
You should do the same.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.880
- Juliette, listen to me.

32:30.880 --> 32:34.040
Big changes always feel
like you're starting over.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.620
It's not like we're all
gonna crash and burn.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.790
- Bad analogy.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.670
- I'm sorry.

32:40.670 --> 32:42.500
I just mean, you know, maybe
we'll have change course.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.830
But we're not
gonna stop making music.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.380
Nothing could ever
make us do that.

32:46.380 --> 32:47.420
- I know that.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.040
- I love you.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.710
- I know that too.
Thank you.

32:51.710 --> 32:54.210
- For what?
I didn't really do anything.

32:54.210 --> 32:57.580
- Yes, you did.
You always listen to me.

32:57.580 --> 33:00.420
Even when I'm being
full of myself or difficult.

33:00.420 --> 33:01.670
You still listen.

33:01.670 --> 33:03.580
I'm really lucky to have you.

33:03.580 --> 33:05.750
- That goes both ways, you know.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.250
- Then that's a good deal.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.710
- I'll talk to you later.
- I love you.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.580
- Hey, good morning.
How's the home front?

33:15.580 --> 33:18.750
- Fine.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.080
- Fine?
All right.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.750
I guess sometimes fine
is gonna have to do.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.540
- Yeah.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.380
- You're an incredible person,
Avery.

33:28.380 --> 33:31.120
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.580
You are loyal
and you're kind.

33:33.580 --> 33:37.040
And I just hope that
she appreciates you.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.620
- Well, what can I say?
She's an exciting woman.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.540
And sometimes you pay
a price for exciting.

33:45.540 --> 33:46.710
- Well, if you ever
want something

33:46.710 --> 33:48.080
a little less complicated...

33:52.250 --> 33:54.120
- Thanks.

33:56.460 --> 33:57.710
I...
- It's okay.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.170
- Okay.

34:12.460 --> 34:16.250
- There's my girls.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.080
- You're going
to be amazing, Dad.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.460
- I'm gonna do all I can.
That's all I can do.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.790
Come here, you.
Come over here.

34:24.790 --> 34:26.380
Don't you cry.

34:26.380 --> 34:27.920
Come on, you did not
do anything wrong, okay?

34:27.920 --> 34:29.880
- No, Dad...
- Listen to me.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.500
You did what you felt was right
in your heart as an artist.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.460
And that is exactly
what I should have done.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.540
And it's what your mama wanted
us all to do at Highway 65.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.960
So don't cry.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.670
- Well, thank you, but that's
really not why I'm crying.

34:40.670 --> 34:42.830
- Then why are you crying?

34:42.830 --> 34:44.920
- Mom would have been
so proud of you, Dad.

34:47.290 --> 34:49.830
So am I.

34:49.830 --> 34:51.750
Go be great.

34:51.750 --> 34:52.920
- (laughs)

34:54.750 --> 34:58.250
(crowd cheering)

34:58.250 --> 35:00.420
- Now welcome back
to the center stage spotlight,

35:00.420 --> 35:03.080
your host for this portion
of tonight's show,

35:03.080 --> 35:05.120
the Opry's own Pam Tillis
right there!

35:05.120 --> 35:07.000
- Thank you, Bill.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.960
Thank you, everybody, thank you.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.250
This next guest

35:11.250 --> 35:14.080
has been on the Opry stage
over 200 times.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.620
Each of those times performing

35:16.620 --> 35:20.830
with my dear friend,
the late, great Rayna Jaymes.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.380
But tonight, I get to
invite him into the Circle

35:28.380 --> 35:30.580
for the very first time.

35:30.580 --> 35:33.500
Please make welcome
Deacon Claybourne!

35:42.710 --> 35:45.830
- Thank y'all so much.

35:45.830 --> 35:47.330
It's hard to explain

35:47.330 --> 35:49.210
what it means for me
to be here tonight

35:49.210 --> 35:52.710
in this place
that Rayna loved so much.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.960
But I'll be honest with you,
I would give anything

35:54.960 --> 35:56.210
if I could be standing
right there,

35:56.210 --> 35:59.330
and she could be
standing right here.

35:59.330 --> 36:02.040
This is for Rayna.
