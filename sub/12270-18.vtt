three fated villagers to inhabit.

-Let it happen, fated one.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.600
She is protected by love.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.560
So we're one break up away from doom.
Seb, wait!

00:15.760 --> 00:18.800
I will do whatever it takes
to bring Seb home.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.000
I promise to break up Seb and Sorsha.

# I got to take control
And write my destiny #

00:38.440 --> 00:44.000

01:12.360 --> 01:16.880
You revise for the test on the Bog War?
I tried, but...

01:17.000 --> 01:18.960
The Founder didn’t make it easy.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.480
There are moments I don’t feel myself,
when I feel her strength gathering.

01:23.640 --> 01:29.520
But Seb always makes me feel better
and I gain control again.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.040
You have to tell him.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.880
I will.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.840
When I’m ready.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.800
I promise.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.680
Seb’s love is the only thing
keeping her safe.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.560
And to save him from Hollowfall,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.800
I made a pact to split them up.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.040
But, you can’t go through with it!

01:53.200 --> 01:57.320
Thank you, Captain Obvious.
I’m working on it.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.960
What’s “Snootcoming?”

02:00.080 --> 02:05.400
To elect the most popular couple,
the King and Queen of Snootcoming!

02:05.520 --> 02:07.760
It’s kind of a big deal.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.600
I was at the first Snootcoming
centuries ago.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.600
Saw the incredible Flame Dance,
before it was banned.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.640
It’s what lit the lantern’s flame
and drew the Founders in.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.800
I recall I had on a blue tunic, leggings--

02:20.960 --> 02:22.960
Whoa, whoa, back up, say that again.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.400
I know! Fashion has changed so much.
No, no!

02:26.520 --> 02:30.000
You said the dance drew the founders
inside the lantern.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.880
If we do that, then we can save Sorsha,
Esmerelda and Lacie.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.160
Yes, but the dance only works

02:36.360 --> 02:38.880
if performed
by the elected King and Queen,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.600
both Evermoor-born.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.000
Now that severely limits your--
Sorsha and Cameron!

02:44.120 --> 02:46.680
The Founders will think
I’m splitting them up

02:46.880 --> 02:49.160
while we have our eyes on the real prize.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.480
It’s perfect!
Or it will be, if the others agree.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.560
All that Cameron and Sorsha have to do
is act like the perfect couple,

02:57.760 --> 03:00.640
win the vote, dance the dance
and save the village.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.880
Who’d say no to that?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
(BELLA AND SEB)
No.

Forget them.
They don’t deserve this.

I know I shouldn’t.

You’ll only break my heart but...

To not air the tape?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.720
Well, I’m not.

Perhaps you’re honoring
your side of the pact, after all.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.600
In fact,
it’s rather cruel what you’re doing.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.120
I rather like it.
