WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:06.172
HOWARD: You will all have noticed
a malodorous fragrance

00:06.256 --> 00:09.843
pervading our building,
courtesy of uncollected garbage

00:09.926 --> 00:11.970
in the alley and beneath our windows,

00:12.053 --> 00:15.432
and intensified by a warm snap
in the weather.

00:15.515 --> 00:21.354
In short, the city's garbage strike
goes into day 12, and as we all feared,

00:22.355 --> 00:26.443
we will now have to assist
sanitation department personnel

00:26.526 --> 00:29.112
-on emergency refuse pickups.
-MAN: You're kidding!

00:29.195 --> 00:30.447
-(crowd mutters)
-WOMAN: What?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.949
HOWARD: Uniforms assigned half day only.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.451
-Morning detail. Brown...
-(meows)

00:34.534 --> 00:37.245
...Kolzicki, Richardson,
Schneider, Hill and Renko.

00:37.328 --> 00:41.875
Well, sir, my back won't take it,
and nevertheless my pride won't take it.

00:41.958 --> 00:43.877
Not to mention my dignity
as a police officer.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.797
As far as our pride and dignity,
Andrew... (clears throat)

00:48.214 --> 00:52.093
There is, uh, a Turkish saying,
and I translate roughly,

00:52.177 --> 00:54.721
"If I am a gentleman
and you are a gentleman,

00:55.430 --> 00:56.639
who will take out the trash?"

00:56.723 --> 00:58.558
(laughter)

00:58.641 --> 01:00.810
Plainclothes personnel will not be spared.

01:00.894 --> 01:05.607
Detectives LaRue and Washington
join garbage collection afternoon detail.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.319
Uh-uh, Sarge, uh,
we're in court on the Benetiz sting.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.237
-Preliminary hearings.
-Well, can't you postpone it?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.238
NEAL: Seventy-two hour deadline.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.325
If we don't make it,
he's paroled and dealing coke by midnight.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.701
-(man groans)
-'Course, uh,

01:16.785 --> 01:21.498
if we happen to get done by around noon
or so, we'll be glad to pitch in.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.083
-(crowd murmurs)
-Yes.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.503
Item eight. As if our hands
weren't already full,

01:26.586 --> 01:31.424
we have today the funeral cortege
of drug kingpin Gerard Cullen.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.802
-Dead at 31.
-(crowd groaning)

01:33.885 --> 01:37.889
Stabbed in his Harrisonville cell
by an unknown assailant.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.766
So young, so innocent.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.102
Talk about stinkin' trash.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.478
HOWARD: To forestall trouble,

01:43.561 --> 01:47.107
the city has granted a parade permit
along Dekker Avenue.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.567
And Lieutenant Buntz will supervise.

01:49.651 --> 01:53.655
Now, uniform personnel please check
the board for crowd control.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.823
-Uh...
-(cat meows)

01:55.490 --> 01:57.826
Ah, item last.

01:58.409 --> 01:59.869
-A new recruit.
-(cat meows)

02:01.454 --> 02:03.915
Please welcome Officer Gracie Allen.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.629
Assignment: rat poaching
immediate environs of the station house.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.549
-Go get 'em. Dismissed.
-(indistinct chatter)

02:14.467 --> 02:17.137
We're talking 12-foot high
piles of caca here.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.598
I'd rather pick up garbage
than do crowd control for that funeral.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.475
Can you believe the city's paying for cops

02:22.559 --> 02:25.520
to stand around like damn honor guards
for Gerard Cullen

02:25.603 --> 02:27.313
like he's a hero or something?

02:28.773 --> 02:31.067
There but for the grace of Benetiz, Neal.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.195
Have you two got the lab report
on Benetiz's alleged cocaine?

02:34.279 --> 02:36.489
Brought 'em in yesterday.
It should be ready now.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.533
We can pick 'em on the way
from the lab on the way to court.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.952
And what lab is that?
The city's or a private contractor?

02:41.035 --> 02:42.370
Contractor. What's the difference?

02:43.037 --> 02:44.539
They'll be there, don't worry.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.250
And what does the PBA say?
It's in the contract.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.877
Well, I didn't contract
to pick up no garbage,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.879
and I am the PBA representative
of this precinct--

02:50.962 --> 02:53.590
Officers Hill and Renko,
I'm Phillips from sanitation.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.757
Just one moment, please.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.469
So I will shortly be calling our lawyer
to try to invalidate this travesty,

02:58.553 --> 03:02.098
but first I must go and prioritize
my own emergency dump site.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.183
Excuse me.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.186
-Officer Hill.
-Yeah.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.398
I'm drivin', you guys are haulin'.
Uh, limousine's parked out front there.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.151
But what-what does he mean
he's prioritizing whose dump site?

03:13.985 --> 03:16.154
I got a Dumpster
in front of my donut shop.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.906
I pay good money for it,

03:17.989 --> 03:21.659
and this Looney Tunes' stuffin'
his garbage in it all day!

03:21.743 --> 03:24.370
What is Looney Tune? Is insult, yes?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.332
Write down he says
I am Looney Tune in public!

03:27.415 --> 03:28.875
-What the heck is this?
-Evidence.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.544
-(men arguing)
-A verbal description will do, officer.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.296
This freakin' stuff reeks.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.174
-It is not my garbage!
-You are a liar!

03:36.257 --> 03:38.259
Write down he says I am liar!

03:38.343 --> 03:39.719
I am Looney Tune!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.430
-Excuse me, is this stuff yours?
-Uh-- Mine? No!

03:42.513 --> 03:43.640
Yes! His!

03:43.723 --> 03:44.974
Prove it, grease ball!

03:45.058 --> 03:48.311
I prove it 'cause you call me grease ball!

03:48.394 --> 03:50.188
Come on, prove it! Prove it!

03:50.271 --> 03:52.941
-Ah! Donut! See?
-Grease ball! Idiot!

03:53.024 --> 03:53.858
Idiot!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.360
(indistinct yelling)

03:55.443 --> 03:57.445
-Oh, you idiot!
-(shouting)

03:58.905 --> 04:00.323
-Morning, Howard.
-Frank.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.743
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:04.077 --> 04:05.870
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:05.954 --> 04:09.707
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:09.791 --> 04:11.334
(sirens wailing)

04:17.090 --> 04:20.093
(theme music playing)

06:11.788 --> 06:13.331
Can I talk to an officer, please?

06:13.414 --> 06:14.248
I got it.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.541
Howard!

06:16.751 --> 06:18.086
We've got a hostage situation.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.338
Wilcox has been shot.
We're not sure how bad.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.133
Division is requesting you take over
emergency action for the duration.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.343
Me?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.762
-Frank?
-First I heard.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.222
If the Division wants you, go.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.807
Green Hotel, as soon as you can.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.268
-What about squad room?
-Sergeant Bates can cover.

06:35.103 --> 06:35.937
Howard!

06:37.939 --> 06:39.273
Right. Right.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.610
All day, all night,
youngster's standin' around on my lawn,

06:42.693 --> 06:44.445
buyin' and sellin' their poison.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.739
Forty years now I kept that lawn nice.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.991
We've got to get you to the hospital, sir.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.576
It makes the house pretty.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.455
Feels good. Brings birds to the door.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.792
They got a fight with some
crack dealers outside his house.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.962
You know, you should have called us,
Mr. Sloane.

07:01.045 --> 07:01.879
That's our job.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.464
Marvin Sloane fights his own battles!

07:03.840 --> 07:05.341
Lucy? Excuse me, I'm sorry.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.552
Uh, Officer Russo will take
your spot out on the street.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.262
You will have the squad room
for a couple of hours.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.179
Okay.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.557
Will you guys get him
over to Mercy emergency?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.767
-Mm-hmm.
-He doesn't hear very well.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.311
Where are we going?

07:17.979 --> 07:20.606
We got to do somethin'
for those cuts, old-timer.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.443
You don't have to yell!
I ain't no invalid!

07:24.026 --> 07:25.570
(gun chamber spinning)

07:32.994 --> 07:33.995
(sighs)

07:42.336 --> 07:43.421
(sighs)

07:43.504 --> 07:46.090
(traffic sounds)

07:46.174 --> 07:49.635
Everybody wants their report yesterday.
My assistant's out with the flu.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.387
Makes Monday the earliest possible.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.556
Oh, terrific.
Your assistant's out with the flu,

07:53.639 --> 07:55.391
so a serious criminal's gonna walk.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.935
Couldn't you hire a temp?
Just for a couple of days?

07:58.019 --> 08:00.897
You show me where I find them
for the lousy money the city pays.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.357
Hey, we ain't an employment agency.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.650
(printer printing)

08:04.734 --> 08:05.776
And I'm not either.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.903
And the longer we argue,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.281
the longer it takes me to get through
my do-outs which I take in order

08:10.364 --> 08:12.325
and which you gentlemen
are somewhere near the bottom.

08:12.408 --> 08:13.993
-(phone rings)
-Good day.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.915
(siren wailing)

08:32.136 --> 08:35.640
(police radio chatter)

08:38.935 --> 08:40.019
Good to have you back, sir.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.314
Thank you. How's Lieutenant Wilcox?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.233
Shoulder wound. They say he's okay.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.150
Ah.

08:48.694 --> 08:49.862
(helicopter rotor whirring)

08:52.615 --> 08:54.408
Have you talked to our man up there yet?

08:54.825 --> 08:55.660
Nothing.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.036
Any information?

08:58.120 --> 09:00.957
Yeah, stuck his head out the window,
took a couple of pot shots.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.709
I don't know. I heard some laughing.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.671
(gunfire)

09:06.754 --> 09:08.506
(laughing)

09:09.840 --> 09:13.094
Lieutenant Hunter! (laughing)

09:13.177 --> 09:14.262
Ballantine?

09:14.762 --> 09:18.140
Besides which,
where do garbage men get off

09:18.224 --> 09:20.434
askin' for parity with police officers?

09:20.518 --> 09:23.396
You know how much garbage
the average garbage man lifts in a year?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.981
Do you know how long
it takes to become a cop?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.400
I mean, how many hundred tons?

09:27.483 --> 09:29.193
-It don't make no difference to me...
-Damn!

09:29.277 --> 09:30.236
...how many tons.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.363
-What?
-Funeral for Cullen.

09:32.446 --> 09:36.701
(indistinct chatter)

09:37.326 --> 09:39.579
Officer, can't you spread
the crowd for us?

09:39.662 --> 09:41.747
-Let us get through?
-Uh-uh. Not till the parade passes.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.291
We're behind already.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.793
If we got to wait, we're gonna miss
the garbage scow on Fourth Street.

09:45.876 --> 09:49.088
Listen, turn it around or wait.
I can't let you through.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.340
(crowd shouting)

10:03.311 --> 10:05.605
All right, keep back. Keep back.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.815
(shouting)

10:07.898 --> 10:10.318
I'm glad he's dead! Y'all hear?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.612
Cullen was evil! He was the devil!

10:12.695 --> 10:14.655
He was the feel good king of the Hill

10:14.739 --> 10:17.283
and he goin' out in style,
just like he lived.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.620
Hey, you want to go out in style, too?
Back up there onto the sidewalk.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.831
Yeah, well, if my man Cullen was alive,
you wouldn't talk to me that way.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.291
He ate you cops for breakfast.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.877
Yeah? Well, it's lunchtime, and he's meat.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.421
So back up there or you're busted
for creatin' a nuisance.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.464
Okay, scum wad?

10:32.757 --> 10:34.216
White man's tie for sure.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.136
Let's beat 'em to the intersection.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.263
-You got it.
-(gears grind)

10:39.347 --> 10:40.514
Hey, what are you doin'?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.975
Get out of the way, son.
We got a route to do.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.435
We're goin' through.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.812
(horn blows)

10:46.896 --> 10:50.775
(crowd cheering)

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
(indistinct)

10:57.281 --> 10:59.200
Hey, what's that garbage truck doin'?

10:59.742 --> 11:02.536
It's probably collectin' garbage.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:08.209 --> 11:10.044
Man, get this truck outta here!

11:10.586 --> 11:12.254
Show some respect for your brother!

11:12.338 --> 11:14.006
Cullen wasn't no brother of mine.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.050
Yeah, you're the garbage man,
and you talk that way

11:16.133 --> 11:18.886
-about a class dude like Cullen?
-Oh, yeah, class dude.

11:18.969 --> 11:22.515
You know how many brothers and sisters
Cullen's junk put in the ground?

11:22.598 --> 11:23.641
Hey, who's the boss?

11:23.724 --> 11:25.226
I got your boss right here, buddy.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.811
So shut up!

11:26.894 --> 11:28.062
(horn honking)

11:28.145 --> 11:29.271
What the hell are you doin'?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.439
We're doin' our job.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.691
Well, do it somewhere else.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.694
Back it up. I'm a police officer.

11:35.319 --> 11:36.779
This is a Black man's funeral.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.280
You comin' down here to hassle us?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.699
Hey, I tell you what, blood, uh,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.034
why don't you give, uh,
us Cullen's casket, man?

11:42.118 --> 11:43.536
We'll save you the trip to the cemetery.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.163
Put it right up there
in the truck right now,

11:46.414 --> 11:47.665
with the rest of the trash.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.419
-What's your problem?
-I'm lookin' at it.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.129
Now, when you goin' move?

11:54.755 --> 11:55.715
When I'm through, man.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.216
You through now!

11:57.591 --> 11:58.926
-Oh, yeah?
-Aah!

11:59.385 --> 12:00.511
Man, what are you--

12:00.594 --> 12:02.763
(crowd yelling)

12:03.931 --> 12:04.890
(indistinct)

12:04.974 --> 12:07.184
You people here to say goodbye to Cullen,

12:07.518 --> 12:10.020
to see he gets the send-off he deserves?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.982
Well, here! Here's what he deserves!

12:15.818 --> 12:19.029
(crowd yelling)

12:31.959 --> 12:34.587
BAILIFF: N695314.

12:34.879 --> 12:39.800
Raul Benetiz, controlled substance,
on for preliminary hearing.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.428
Detectives, glad you could make it.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.013
You ready to proceed?

12:44.096 --> 12:46.474
No, Your Honor. Lab report's not ready.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.642
Ah, come on!

12:49.643 --> 12:50.561
Defense application.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.272
Parole, 72-hour rule.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.358
Your Honor, in the people's opinion,
if Mr. Benetiz is paroled today,

12:56.442 --> 12:58.068
he won't be back until
the next time he's arrested.

12:58.152 --> 13:00.529
Mr. Bernstein, I don't make up the laws.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.449
And I didn't invent the fact that
we've got a record number of drug busts.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.993
How about till the close
of business, Judge?

13:06.076 --> 13:08.788
Defendant was arraigned
at 10:00 a.m. three days ago.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.373
Damn it, Judge,
we worked hard on this collar.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.001
It's not our fault
that-that they farm this stuff out

13:14.084 --> 13:15.836
to those incompetent private labs.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.755
Guy had a personnel problem.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.133
If I put the case down for 4:00,
Detective, would it make a difference?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.051
Yes.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.719
JUDGE: Could the lab
do its report by then?

13:25.012 --> 13:28.808
Yes, I believe so.
T-They indicated a strong possibility.

13:29.183 --> 13:33.521
You see, your, uh, client's a bail jumper
from way back, Ms. Davenport.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.817
I'm sure our Detective LaRue
wouldn't deceive this tribunal.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.860
-On again at 4:00.
-(bangs gavel)

13:39.944 --> 13:42.363
-Any shot?
-All kinds of shot.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.573
Sure, guys.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.200
-How?
-How?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.785
How? I don't know how.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.537
Maybe we could find Kruger some help.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.040
You. You, sir, are a true genius.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.543
Okay, assault, disturbin' the peace,

13:55.626 --> 13:58.295
interferin' with a police officer
in the performance of his duty.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.672
Collectin' the garbage, that your duty?

13:59.755 --> 14:00.756
Yes, it is.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.258
You know, Harry Kessler.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.759
Didn't he go to pharmacy school
or somethin'?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.095
Uh-uh. Veterinary school, you know.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.723
Uh, Officer Hill, we heard
that you dumped the garbage

14:09.807 --> 14:12.393
on the hearse, but, uh,
we didn't hear why.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.727
No comment.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.647
Officer Hill, my office.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.901
Ah, why don't you talk
to Mr. Phillips here,

14:20.985 --> 14:22.486
see if he's got somethin' to say.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.113
-All right.
-Okay.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.074
You were making a statement about Cullen.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.785
We just want you to put it in words.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.498
Granted, there was provocation,

14:34.999 --> 14:38.502
but it sounds to me as if your reactions
were over the line, out of proportion.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.547
Captain, a public funeral
honoring a man like Gerard Cullen

14:41.630 --> 14:42.673
is out of proportion, too.

14:42.756 --> 14:44.466
You don't think for a minute
I disagree with that?

14:45.259 --> 14:48.220
But I don't have to tell you that your
behavior could have caused a disaster.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.389
-We almost had a riot on our hands.
-I know.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.518
But I have been cleanin' up
Cullen's messes for so long that I'm--

14:54.602 --> 14:56.937
You can give your reasons
in a blow-by-blow in your report.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.648
For now I'm looking to see whether
disciplinary action's in order.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.735
I can understand that, sir,

15:02.818 --> 15:05.154
and I can see how you'd want
to consider that option.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.072
Am I dismissed?

15:12.786 --> 15:14.997
I mean, how many guys
know their way around the chemistry

15:15.080 --> 15:17.249
of controlled substances as well as you,
and get to make a quick dollar...

15:17.333 --> 15:19.126
-Have you seen Norm?
-Not for a while.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.544
-...all within the law?
-Okay.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.212
Oh, yeah? Oh, thanks for nothin'.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.006
(slams phone down)

15:24.340 --> 15:26.800
Neal, what's the name of that
high school chemistry teacher

15:26.884 --> 15:28.302
we busted for indecent exposure?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.804
Am I overhearing the need
for skilled help here?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.098
You want bucks? Go ask Sergeant Bates.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.517
Come on, guys, I heard what I heard.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.519
What kind of controlled substance
we talkin' about?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.272
Hey, J.D., don't even think it.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.567
He has had experience testin' coke, Neal.
Am I right, Sid?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.945
Are turkeys nervous in November?

15:46.028 --> 15:49.907
So? I can quack and I can
waddle across the street.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.784
But that don't make me no duck.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.622
You want to lose Benetiz, Neal?
We don't have a vast amount of time here.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.374
You busy this afternoon?

15:58.457 --> 16:02.544
The things I got penciled in could be
erased for the proper compensation.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.213
-Come on.
-Oh...

16:04.296 --> 16:05.506
LUCY: Bobby Hill, line three.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.049
-Hey, Wash.
-(mutters)

16:08.884 --> 16:09.718
Hmm.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.012
Officer Hill speaking.

16:15.891 --> 16:16.725
Excuse me?

16:19.269 --> 16:20.104
Just a second.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.399
Communications,
I want a trace, line three!

16:27.194 --> 16:28.612
-Did you get that?
-Yeah, we got it.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.697
You got it.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.867
Uh, sorry, um,
lost you there for a second.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.912
This is Officer Hill, Hill Street station.

16:37.287 --> 16:39.498
Um, is it me you wanted to talk to?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.920
Ha. This is Harry. This is Harry, right?

16:45.754 --> 16:48.757
Harry, haven't we outgrown
these practical jokes, partner?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.636
Yeah, hold on for a second.

16:53.721 --> 16:54.805
-Hello?
-Who's that?

16:55.305 --> 16:56.473
(hangs phone up)

16:56.557 --> 16:58.142
Man said, "You're a dead cop."

16:58.225 --> 16:59.351
One of Cullen's people?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.855
MAN: Nailed one at last,
but it was just a phone booth.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.274
Hundred and ninth and-and Western Avenue.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.775
That's a funeral parlor, right?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.068
-Cullen's gang.
-MICK: Bobby.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.779
Is this right? Somebody just threaten you?

17:11.739 --> 17:12.865
Let's go visitin', huh?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.410
See if we can't arrange a frank
and open exchange of views here.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.121
(telephone ringing)

17:19.204 --> 17:21.373
Let's go. Let's go!

17:24.460 --> 17:27.546
So, Marv, you remember
anything else about the jerks

17:27.629 --> 17:32.092
who hit you besides one of 'em had shades
and the other had purple shoes?

17:32.176 --> 17:35.304
-A hat, and the white Panama.
-(indistinct police radio)

17:36.013 --> 17:38.807
He was sort of wiry.
There was three of 'em.

17:39.725 --> 17:43.062
It happened so fast.
But I got one good lick in, I think.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.355
Now, Mr. Sloane, what about your glasses?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.733
The nurse says that your
prescription's out of date.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.819
I can see enough to see
you're a fine lookin' woman.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.654
(laughing)

17:52.738 --> 17:54.990
Plus, you'll need a new hearing aid.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.660
-What? Say that again?
-You need a new hearing aid!

17:58.744 --> 18:00.162
Hey, all that stuff costs money.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.539
(dog barking)

18:05.334 --> 18:06.710
(yells) Beat it!

18:07.211 --> 18:09.379
Damn dog has stamped down all my shrubs!

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
This used to be a pretty
little house when I bought it.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.384
Kept it nice for years.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.638
I didn't know it was gonna become
the crack stand of the neighborhood.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.140
-You live alone?
-MARVIN: Yeah, my wife's inside now.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.267
She's prayin' the dealers
don't bust open my skull.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.228
Mr. Sloane, we're going to try
and get more patrols--

18:24.311 --> 18:27.397
-This was a quiet place!
-(dog barks)

18:27.481 --> 18:30.400
I built some of these houses.
Used to be a hard carrier.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.530
Twenty pounds of mud on my shoulders,
up and down scaffoldin' all day.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.533
-Pat, uh, get the social services book.
-Yeah.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.743
Look, I ain't goin' to stand in
no lines all day for no charity.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.162
Now, look,
Medicaid isn't charity, Mr. Sloane.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.539
-It's you're right.
-(car door slams)

18:43.622 --> 18:45.749
Now you change your mind about
those eyeglasses and getting

18:45.833 --> 18:49.419
your hearing aid fixed
and then you call these numbers, okay?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.756
And, meanwhile, you gotta be careful
around those guys.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.634
They come back, they better be careful.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.137
(children shouting playfully)

18:58.220 --> 19:01.390
(police radio, indistinct)

19:01.473 --> 19:03.350
Got some info on the hostage.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.603
A shrink from Uxbridge Hospital,
Dr. Katchmer.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.022
Ballantine's been coming to him
once a week for counseling.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.482
A shrink, Judas.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.901
I'll wager the man's wishing
he'd gone into podiatry.

19:14.069 --> 19:14.903
Ballantine?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.823
BALLANTINE (on phone): <i>Have you</i>
<i>established a kill zone yet, Hunter?</i>

19:18.365 --> 19:21.827
<i>When's Peddlehopper's recon unit</i>
<i>detaching a Boy Scout team up here?</i>

19:21.910 --> 19:24.246
<i>Come on, execute the game plan!</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:26.707
No one is gonna try
and trick you, Ballantine.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.210
BALLANTINE (on phone): <i>I've got your</i>
<i>soft Bible engraved on my skull!</i>

19:30.294 --> 19:32.379
<i>This ninja is ready</i>
<i>for whatever you've got!</i>

19:32.462 --> 19:35.632
I give you my word,
we are holding our fire, Ballantine.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.842
BALLANTINE (on phone): <i>Oh, no, go ahead!</i>

19:36.925 --> 19:39.386
Deploy those goose-stepping clones,

19:39.469 --> 19:42.014
Myerhoff and Simpson,
up the back fire escape.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.640
They'll walk into a turkey shoot!

19:44.433 --> 19:47.728
Tell the men on the back fire escape
to back off until ordered.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.646
(rifle cocks)

19:49.730 --> 19:51.857
(gunshots)

19:51.940 --> 19:53.108
-Return fire, sir?
-No!

19:53.817 --> 19:55.527
No, he can be talked down, I'm sure of it.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.071
In any event,
he's got the shrink too close.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.283
Ballantine. Ballantine.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.869
How did we come to this? Think, son.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.788
Think about what you're doing.
You shot a fellow EATer.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.749
-Yes, I did, Hunter.
-(aerosol spraying)

20:09.291 --> 20:11.710
I did that. And I regret that.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.504
Good. Jack, that's good.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.716
Yeah. What I really regret
is that it wasn't you!

20:17.799 --> 20:20.344
Aah! Ta-da!

20:20.427 --> 20:22.596
-(gunshots)
-Aah!

20:22.679 --> 20:25.015
(tires screech)

20:29.228 --> 20:31.647
(police radio chatter)

20:41.657 --> 20:44.493
(indistinct chatter)

20:49.248 --> 20:51.124
(room quiets)

20:51.208 --> 20:54.503
You have the bad taste to come here,
bother people, at a time like this?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.838
Who said people? We want you, Manly.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.632
We got somethin' to discuss.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.390
Bring 'em.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.854
What's this thing we got to discuss,

21:12.938 --> 21:15.232
aside from you got our man Burroughs
on phony charges?

21:15.315 --> 21:16.692
Gee, I don't know. Pick a subject.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.986
Spread 'em! Get down there!

21:19.528 --> 21:20.696
Aw, this is a roust.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.239
I don't know. Define roust, huh?

21:22.322 --> 21:24.616
Is this what you do when
you roast somebody, huh? Huh?

21:24.700 --> 21:28.328
You never threaten cops, pal!
That's somethin' you never, ever do!

21:28.412 --> 21:31.290
All right, well, I can't find
any weapons, Mick. You?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.542
-I'm not done lookin'!
-You gonna ruin my jacket!

21:33.625 --> 21:35.460
I see you got no respect
for my fine threads.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.963
Oh. What do you think, Norm?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.632
Maybe the weapon is in the clothes.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.467
The lining, sure.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.386
All right, men, come on.
Let's have your jackets.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.847
Come on, let's have your jackets!
You hear me, huh?

21:46.930 --> 21:48.682
Come on! All right.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.101
NORMAN: Ain't finding nothin' here, huh?

21:51.601 --> 21:52.519
Find anything, Mick?

21:52.602 --> 21:54.896
-(clothing ripping)
-(Norman laughs)

21:58.608 --> 22:00.861
PATRICK: I wish I would have been there.
What'd they say?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.864
They didn't make much conversation.
Is that the last refill?

22:03.947 --> 22:06.867
Gentlemen, we have been put down
and plowed under by Division,

22:06.950 --> 22:09.536
by lawyers, by street-comers
lo these many years,

22:09.619 --> 22:11.246
and today we stood up and fought back.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.456
Here's to us.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.498
All right.

22:14.082 --> 22:14.916
Partner.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.544
To us.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.505
(sniffs) How come
I don't smell any garbage?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.424
TINA: 'Cause the wind shifted.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.260
Patrick, white Panama hat.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.555
PATRICK: And purple shoes,
as per Mr. Sloane's assailant.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.433
-As I live and breathe!
-This guy's tough to collar.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.268
RENKO: Y'all want some help, Officer?

22:36.271 --> 22:37.314
Stop! Police!

22:37.397 --> 22:39.107
(man shouts in Spanish)

22:42.986 --> 22:45.072
Up against the wall!
Let's go! Hands over your head!

22:45.155 --> 22:47.783
-I'm clean here!
-Then why the 50-yard dash?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.451
I'm late to see my girlfriend.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.245
Where are you takin' her, the Sovereign?

22:52.329 --> 22:55.540
Ah, he's saving his pennies
to buy a crack franchise, huh?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.209
My girlfriend gave me that.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.462
If it's illegal to have money,
put all the white people in jail.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.297
(beeping)

23:02.381 --> 23:05.550
Let me guess. Your girlfriend's calling.

23:07.427 --> 23:11.306
Are you well versed in lab procedure
mister, uh, Thurston?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.809
This guy was practically
born in a test tube.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.727
Well, I'll have to do
some background checking.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.396
Well, you're welcome
to call my references,

23:17.479 --> 23:19.773
but it's still, uh,
kind of early in Hawaii.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.858
He'll work cheap. Won't you, Mr. Thurston?

23:21.942 --> 23:24.569
Well, uh, within reason
for a man of my credentials.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.655
Give the man a little
demonstration, Sidney.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.240
Oh, I would love to. May I?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.283
-Would you?
-Here.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.285
This is, uh-- You got a scale?

23:32.994 --> 23:34.746
That's about a half a pound.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.624
Actually, just a little under.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.667
There you go.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.255
Ay, 0.46, bingo!

23:43.338 --> 23:44.548
-Eh?
-Vinegar?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.133
Ascetic acid?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.387
Uh, they're a little bit
informal about labels in Hawaii.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.388
-Hmm.
-Hawaii.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.728
Ascetic acid, vinegar, whatever.

24:01.940 --> 24:06.736
Just a pinch of the, uh,
unidentified substance.

24:08.613 --> 24:12.617
Rock it out with a dash
of, uh, cobalt thiocyanate.

24:12.701 --> 24:16.121
Say the tragic, magic words.

24:18.498 --> 24:19.624
-Oh.
-Ooh.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.502
-Turns to a blushing blue.
-Meaning?

24:22.586 --> 24:24.629
Meaning it's got the right beat,
but at this point we don't know

24:24.713 --> 24:25.797
whether we can dance to it.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.799
Confirmatory test?

24:27.883 --> 24:29.968
You got any platinum chloride
in the cupboard?

24:30.051 --> 24:32.637
(sighs) Okay, okay.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.805
Okay, okay, I'm hired?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.557
-Okay, he's hired.
-Eh.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.101
-And we get our report, right, Mr. Kruger?
-Yeah, yeah.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.604
-See you in one hour, Sidney.
-One hour.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.688
(indistinct police radio)

24:41.771 --> 24:45.358
-It's the sugar from the donuts.
-What is?

24:45.442 --> 24:47.486
The sugar, it's a mood deal.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.070
Like a roller coaster,
it goes up and down.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.572
Daryl Ann set it out for me.

24:51.615 --> 24:52.449
Well?

24:53.241 --> 24:54.910
Well, if it ain't the sugar,
it's gotta be somethin'.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.578
We got off easy on the garbage detail.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.080
We got to do tap-dancin'
on some bad guys' heads.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.875
Had a good time for the first time
in a long time.

25:01.958 --> 25:02.876
-Had fun--
-Furillo.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.793
Furillo?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.629
As in Captain Furillo.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.796
Jury's still out on whether or not

25:06.880 --> 25:09.257
he'll discipline me
for flingin' that garbage.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.968
No, man, that's just a reprimand,
it's a slap on the wrist.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.596
And then what do I do
but go roustin' some hoods

25:14.679 --> 25:17.390
with-- with you guys
like a bunch of damn rookies?

25:17.474 --> 25:19.226
-They threatened your life!
-Smart move.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.019
What are you gonna do about that, man?

25:21.102 --> 25:23.605
-They threatened your life!
-But doesn't the captain see?

25:24.231 --> 25:27.192
Doesn't he realize
what it's like standin' out there,

25:27.275 --> 25:30.612
while Cullen's bein' strut
past us like peacocks!

25:30.695 --> 25:32.572
-You gotta see it from his side.
-His side?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.990
Yeah, somethin' goes wrong like that,

25:34.074 --> 25:36.743
it's like the department's responsible
or somethin' like that.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.662
WOMAN (over radio): <i>All units in vicinity,</i>
<i>shooting at dump site.</i>

25:38.745 --> 25:41.498
<i>Corner of Hudson and 111.</i>
<i>Operator of garbage truck down.</i>

25:41.581 --> 25:42.958
-(siren wails)
-Hit it! Come on!

25:51.091 --> 25:53.176
(siren stops, tires squeal)

25:53.677 --> 25:55.470
Guy starting shootin'
at him out of nowhere.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.014
Earl had a gun. Fired back.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.392
Paramedics will be here, partner.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.352
(breathing slowly) I got him.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.145
Shh, shh, shh.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.273
I shot him between the legs, man.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.941
-Earl...
-You know what I mean?

26:08.024 --> 26:10.193
-Earl, just lay still.
-He about my height.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.280
-(wheezing)
-Earl, just be quiet.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.745
-Can you back up, sir?
-I've got a pulse.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.872
He's not breathing, he's not breathing.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.417
-Start your ventilations.
-It's bad, right?

26:25.500 --> 26:28.420
-It's an abdominal wound.
-I've got the ventilations here.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.880
MAN 1: His pulse is fading.
We're losing him, we're losing him.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.216
-MAN 2: Oh, man...
-They're gonna lose him.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.469
-MAN 1: Come on, breathe, breathe.
-MAN 2: Okay.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.305
They gonna lose him, Renko.

26:38.388 --> 26:39.222
Morning.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.141
-Morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.813
Driver's standing by out front
to take me to Farmingdale.

26:46.896 --> 26:49.190
But I had to stop by and say
that it's a hell of a day

26:49.274 --> 26:50.775
-for the department, Frank.
-Oh?

26:50.859 --> 26:54.863
Our man Hill sabotaging that dope dealer's
funeral procession, I love it.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.825
Hill's stunt was provocative,
uncontrolled, and now it turns out--

26:58.908 --> 27:01.328
Aw, geez, Frank, try and be
a human being for once, will ya?

27:01.411 --> 27:04.414
And now it turns out we may have
a homicide because of it!

27:04.914 --> 27:06.166
Somebody just shot Earl Phillips,

27:06.249 --> 27:08.293
the man who was driving
the truck Hill was on.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.128
His chances of recovery are lousy.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.589
-One of Cullen's men?
-We don't know that.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.134
Phillips shot back, wounded the man.
We're checking all the hospitals.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.512
Well, of course,
that is unfortunate, but...

27:19.929 --> 27:21.139
But worth it, Chief?

27:22.349 --> 27:24.059
Keep me informed on the investigation.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.562
And, Frank, about Hill's behavior,

27:27.646 --> 27:29.731
try and get behind your men, will you?

27:30.482 --> 27:33.652
They aren't diplomats.
This ain't the peace corps.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.034
Excellent work today, Officer.

27:41.785 --> 27:44.120
The guy we were with out there just died.

27:44.913 --> 27:45.747
Phillips?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.208
Yes, sir.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.001
Then he was a hero.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.254
MAN: Chief Daniels, just one
moment of your time, please.

27:53.338 --> 27:58.593
I have a car waiting for me, gentlemen.
I have time for one, maybe two questions.

28:05.642 --> 28:06.851
TINA: Well, Mr. Sloane?

28:10.939 --> 28:11.856
PATRICK: Take your time.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.986
Take all day, it won't make no difference.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.493
Honest truth,

28:23.576 --> 28:27.747
couldn't see their faces then,
I can't see 'em now. I'm sorry.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.083
Don't be sorry, just get your eyes fixed.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.167
And your hearing.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.753
I'm gonna take you over there
myself to make sure.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.006
-No, not today. I'm all worn out today.
-Then tomorrow.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.092
And we're gonna make sure
that there's more drive-bys

28:39.175 --> 28:40.719
on your street, Mr. Sloane.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.472
Is there somethin' I can do for you two
now that you've done for me?

28:44.556 --> 28:46.933
Thanks, but that's not necessary,
Mr. Sloane.

28:47.016 --> 28:49.936
Oh, yeah, it is. I can wise you up.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.188
Uh, you two ain't married, is you?

28:52.272 --> 28:53.273
No.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.650
Well, you ought to be. To each other.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.611
Where you goin' to find yourself
a woman finer than this one?

28:58.695 --> 29:01.698
-Kinder or prettier?
-(chuckles)

29:01.781 --> 29:02.866
Mr. Sloane.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.703
Old man's privilege. I tell it like it is.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.204
(chuckles)

29:17.797 --> 29:21.342
Cap, Guy just checked out
emergency room at Mercy's, uh,

29:21.926 --> 29:23.052
a little short on manhood.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.304
-Fits the description.
-Let's go.

29:24.387 --> 29:26.848
Get DA authorization
and an arrest warrant.

29:26.931 --> 29:27.766
Will do.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.273
-I'll be with you in a minute, guys.
-What the hell's goin' on here?

29:35.356 --> 29:37.192
Don't worry about this. Ain't your stuff.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.319
Could you get me
a fire extinguisher, Detective?

29:40.278 --> 29:41.529
I'm tryin' out certain ideas,

29:41.613 --> 29:44.949
certain combinations
in a designer field of medication.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.121
Maybe I'll invent something.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.165
They already got the neutron bomb, Sid.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.000
-Where's Kruger at?
-He's over at O'Malley's.

29:54.083 --> 29:58.296
Which even if the health inspector was
right next door, I still don't eat there.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.590
-The report, Sid?
-Oh, yeah, right.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.717
Tested <i>mucho el dopo.</i>

30:03.218 --> 30:05.386
-You did good, Sid.
-Well, this is a righteous gig.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.764
I-I gotta really thank you guys
for puttin' me on to it.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.641
Don't mention it... to anybody, Sid.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.726
I won't. What's he payin', by the way?

30:12.268 --> 30:14.437
Between you and Kruger.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.355
Great.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.483
Hey, Madame Curie,
you got another fire goin' there.

30:18.566 --> 30:19.859
Oh, geez.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.532
Uh, how about it? Can we talk to Higby?

30:25.615 --> 30:26.491
Doctor says no.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.910
Is this doctor aware that
Higby's under arrest for murder?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.912
He's also been under general anesthesia.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.623
Well, what's the PD doin' in there?
Watchin' him sleep?

30:34.374 --> 30:35.416
Let me take a shot.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.087
Ms. Davenport.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.839
I'm short on time, Lieutenant.

30:40.922 --> 30:42.006
This won't take long.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.133
(clears throat)

30:44.592 --> 30:48.346
Higby, case against him's,
uh, a lock, right?

30:48.721 --> 30:49.889
There's the gun in his car,

30:49.973 --> 30:51.891
the blood on his shirt,
a witness on the street.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.351
Mostly circumstantial.

30:53.434 --> 30:54.978
If you're leading up to some kind of deal,

30:55.061 --> 30:57.397
I've already told the DA
my client's not interested.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.399
Your client's a flea, Ms. Davenport.

30:59.482 --> 31:02.902
He's a microscopic particle.
It's the people who hired him we want.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.822
I've told you, Lieutenant,
we're not looking for any deals.

31:05.905 --> 31:06.990
I'm due in court.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.908
This is a deal with a difference, please.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.120
(sighs) Well?

31:13.872 --> 31:14.706
Thing is,

31:15.707 --> 31:19.210
seein' Higby's definitely gonna
do some time, probably a lot,

31:19.294 --> 31:23.673
the only question is what kind of time
he's gonna do, considerin' his condition.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.092
-What condition?
-(coughs)

31:27.427 --> 31:31.681
You're, ah, familiar with
the exact nature of Higby's wound?

31:31.764 --> 31:34.350
-Uh, Lieutenant--
-The way it lightened him up, I mean.

31:34.434 --> 31:38.438
So now he's a little short in the, uh,
crucial equipment department.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.565
As my grandmother used to say,

31:40.648 --> 31:42.442
what's that got to do
with the price of beans?

31:42.525 --> 31:44.569
I wouldn't be discussin' this
with your grandmother.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.071
It's sort of a... delicate area.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.116
-I'm listening.
-(sighs)

31:50.199 --> 31:53.036
If Higby's fellow inmates were to, uh,

31:53.661 --> 31:57.916
somehow find out
how he ain't the man he used to be.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.127
How he ain't even a man at all,
so to speak.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.381
-You're saying he'd be abused.
-As in badly.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.386
And unless Higby names
his alleged employers,

32:10.470 --> 32:12.597
you'd see to it that somebody
got the word out?

32:15.975 --> 32:18.436
That offer's astoundingly improper,
Lieutenant.

32:18.519 --> 32:20.438
You try it and I'll hit you
with a restraining order.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.482
Just tell him what I told you, all right?

32:22.565 --> 32:25.944
I'll of course relay to Mr. Higby
anything that's relevant to his case.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.445
That's all we can ask, Counselor.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.740
-(footsteps receding)
-(sighs)

32:31.699 --> 32:33.993
HOWARD: You remember
the survivalist conference, Jack?

32:34.077 --> 32:36.788
How we had to bivouac
in that swamp and we--

32:36.871 --> 32:38.957
we were only 50 yards
from the headquarters.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.126
But the fog was so thick
we just couldn't see it.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.214
And remember, remember how
we sang songs to keep up our spirits?

32:47.840 --> 32:49.550
Sure, sure you do, Jack.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.511
Let's sing now.

32:51.803 --> 32:52.637
Maybe...

32:54.889 --> 32:56.224
Maybe I ought to take over, Howard.

32:57.016 --> 32:58.309
Is that an order, Lieutenant?

32:58.601 --> 33:00.979
It's no order, Howard,
I just thought I'd give it a try.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.855
(helicopter rotors whirring)

33:03.648 --> 33:04.482
(clears throat)

33:06.401 --> 33:07.986
Ballantine, this is Lieutenant Goldblume.

33:08.069 --> 33:08.903
Oh.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.031
Oh, swell. Super!

33:12.365 --> 33:15.284
Now I get that-that steady,
reasonable stuff, huh?

33:15.368 --> 33:17.412
<i>The psychological approach?</i>

33:17.495 --> 33:19.539
I already got a psychologist
up here, Goldblume,

33:19.622 --> 33:21.124
and I'm about to blow his head off!

33:21.207 --> 33:24.377
No psychological stuff.
Just a direct appeal to your intelligence.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.254
Come out. Come down.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.506
You can't do yourself
any good in there, Ballantine.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.883
BALLANTINE (on radio):
<i>Okay, sure. You got me.</i>

33:30.967 --> 33:32.552
(chuckles) One condition.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.012
HENRY (on radio): <i>What's that?</i>

33:34.095 --> 33:37.432
You shoot Hunter for me
and toss his body out where I can see it!

33:37.515 --> 33:38.391
(Ballantine laughing)

33:38.474 --> 33:40.560
Ballantine, Ballantine, listen to me.

33:40.643 --> 33:42.437
(Ballantine continues laughing crazily)

33:43.271 --> 33:45.106
He's reaching some kind of breaking point.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.525
If we have a shot,
we're gonna have to take it.

33:47.608 --> 33:50.486
Uh, we're still in the talk mode here.
Shall I try again?

33:52.071 --> 33:52.905
Jack?

33:53.698 --> 33:56.576
Jack, it's me.
Now-now, listen to me, son.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.328
Uh, you are angry at me.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.790
And I-I'm sure that you feel
that you have every right,

34:02.874 --> 34:06.711
that-that I have been pompous
or vain on occasion.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.504
On occasion? Ha!

34:09.297 --> 34:11.424
I understand how you feel, Jack.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.510
Okay, Hunter. I'll sing with you.

34:15.303 --> 34:16.137
Say again?

34:16.220 --> 34:17.930
Yeah, I remember that song we sang.

34:18.014 --> 34:18.848
Good.

34:19.682 --> 34:20.600
Jack, good.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.187
BALLANTINE (on radio):
<i>♪ Over hill, over dale ♪</i>

34:25.104 --> 34:27.732
BOTH: ♪ We will hit the dusty trail ♪

34:27.940 --> 34:31.778
♪ As the caissons go rolling along ♪

34:32.820 --> 34:34.989
♪ Counter march, right about ♪

34:35.114 --> 34:37.450
♪ Hear the wagon soldiers shout ♪

34:37.658 --> 34:40.745
<i>-♪ As those caissons go rolling along ♪</i>
-Do you feel it, Jack?

34:41.287 --> 34:43.539
♪ Oh, it's hi, hi, hee... ♪

34:43.831 --> 34:45.041
BALLANTINE (on radio): <i>No!</i>

34:46.042 --> 34:48.419
No more! No more singing!

34:49.629 --> 34:52.340
Using a song on me like I was a child.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.384
Playing on my feelings
about military service!

34:56.511 --> 34:58.554
But-but you wanted to sing, Jack.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.515
You said, "I'll sing with you."
Do you remember, Jack?

35:01.641 --> 35:04.977
(banging phone receiver)

35:07.438 --> 35:09.607
I won't be played on anymore!

35:10.024 --> 35:13.319
Not by you, Hunter! Not by Goldblume!

35:13.694 --> 35:16.864
Not by this worm of a psychiatrist
I've got here!

35:17.365 --> 35:21.577
You're all like metastasized cells
eating your way into my brain!

35:22.495 --> 35:24.455
(gunshot)

35:25.832 --> 35:27.500
MAN: Let's get the medics in there!

35:30.920 --> 35:32.588
(siren wailing)

35:35.174 --> 35:36.008
Hold it.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.222
Okay.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.148
Oh, Dr. Katchmer,
I'm glad to see that you're all right.

35:50.606 --> 35:54.819
I know it's a lot to ask,
but you must try not to blame Jack.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.737
-He was--
-I don't blame Jack.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.991
I blame you, the great Lieutenant Hunter.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.786
Jack trusted you.
You were the father he never had.

36:04.203 --> 36:06.581
But you were too busy
hanging upside down from the ceiling

36:07.165 --> 36:08.875
or dating transsexuals.

36:09.959 --> 36:10.793
He told you that?

36:16.048 --> 36:17.300
Ragged you pretty hard, sir.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.470
Ah, yes, uh, man's obviously suffering
from negative transference.

36:22.430 --> 36:26.934
Recall docket N695314.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.187
Raul Benetiz.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.820
I don't see Ms. Davenport.

36:37.904 --> 36:41.073
Oh, she's on another case, Your Honor.
I'm counsel for the defense.

36:42.658 --> 36:44.452
Bernstein, do we have our lab report?

36:49.582 --> 36:52.460
In that case, I'm granting
defense's request for parole.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.129
Got it, Your Honor.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.220
No sweat. Felony weight.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.847
What did you do,
buy the guy a ticket to the Bahamas?

37:04.931 --> 37:05.765
Don't answer that.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.477
This looks in order. Okay!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.939
I think we're ready
for a preliminary hearing.

37:13.022 --> 37:15.399
-Oh, man.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

37:15.483 --> 37:19.153
And, uh, may I add that this is an example
of the private sector

37:19.237 --> 37:21.614
and the public sector
working hand in hand.

37:21.697 --> 37:22.907
(yawns) Thank you.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.665
You know, I can't believe how quickly
Higby rolled over on his bosses.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.709
Yeah, well, the remainder
of his privates were in danger.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.301
(chatter)

37:42.385 --> 37:44.929
-(glass shattering)
-(woman screams)

37:47.473 --> 37:48.808
-Police! Freeze!
-(woman screams)

37:48.891 --> 37:50.851
-NORMAN: Manly!
-(shouting)

37:53.187 --> 37:54.021
Freeze!

37:54.105 --> 37:55.856
(shouting)

37:55.940 --> 37:57.775
Get up there! Come on, get up there!

37:57.858 --> 37:59.694
Come on, you're under arrest! Come on!

37:59.777 --> 38:02.113
I'll put you in the damned
garbage truck, Manly!

38:02.196 --> 38:04.365
(telephone ringing)

38:04.448 --> 38:06.284
All right, turn in here
and face the counter

38:06.367 --> 38:07.326
and shut your damn mouth.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.620
Come on, walk. Move! Move! Come on!

38:10.079 --> 38:13.874
Hey. All right, John Manly,
Butch Jones, David Morris.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.377
Conspiracy to commit murder,
all three of 'em.

38:18.879 --> 38:22.091
Lieutenant, Chief Daniels says that
the arrest of Cullen's men quote,

38:22.174 --> 38:24.927
"Strikes a heavy blow against
drug traffic here on the Hill."

38:25.011 --> 38:26.178
-Would you agree with that?
-Sure.

38:26.262 --> 38:29.098
Uh, the last half hour at least.
Depends on the weather.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.060
Look at that, partner,
biggest bust since the Brinks job.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.312
And we could have had a taste of it

38:34.395 --> 38:36.605
if they wouldn't have
pulled us off trash detail.

38:36.689 --> 38:39.650
Hey, can't feel too bad, babe.
We've done pretty well ourselves today.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.943
I have to hand it to you, gentlemen,

38:41.027 --> 38:43.821
I heard you really pulled the rabbit
out of the hat with that lab test.

38:43.904 --> 38:46.407
Just a couple of guys doing our jobs,
Ms. Davenport.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.783
Two weeks' worth of work,

38:47.867 --> 38:51.871
scorched by that arsonist
you palmed off on me as a chemist!

38:52.330 --> 38:54.248
Excuse me, uh, what chemist is that, sir?

38:54.332 --> 38:55.875
Ah, it's police business, Ms. Davenport.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.918
Could we discuss this in private,
Mr. Kruger?

38:58.002 --> 39:00.254
Plus that moron
lifted three grams of coke!

39:00.338 --> 39:02.631
Probably out frying
his pea brain right now.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.383
Uh, must be some kind of mistake, sir.

39:04.467 --> 39:07.887
Only mistake is I let you talk me
into believing that lizard had a degree!

39:08.637 --> 39:11.057
I called a reference number
on his application

39:11.307 --> 39:14.435
and got the Blue Bird of Happiness
Massage Parlor in Honolulu.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.686
Uh, excuse me, Detective.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.938
Uh, what was the name
of that chemist you hired?

39:18.022 --> 39:20.900
Thurston. Sidney Thurston.

39:22.401 --> 39:23.235
No way.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.623
Howard, how are you?

39:37.124 --> 39:39.126
Just talked to Ballantine's doctor.

39:40.336 --> 39:43.255
Looks like it's gonna be
a long road back for him.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.132
Yeah.

39:47.593 --> 39:48.844
I thought I could reach him.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.307
Ah. Truth is, uh...

39:54.558 --> 39:56.310
I wasn't very good out there today.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.480
(sighs) Um...

40:00.981 --> 40:04.110
I felt like I was
being jostled by shadows.

40:04.693 --> 40:06.028
-You did fine.
-(chuckles)

40:08.739 --> 40:12.910
Well, I didn't think I was gonna get
a chance to put this on for a while.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.915
Any word from the review board yet?

40:17.998 --> 40:19.417
No. (sighs)

40:26.465 --> 40:27.758
(meowing)

40:29.885 --> 40:31.095
Officer Allen.

40:31.178 --> 40:34.014
(meowing continues)

40:39.353 --> 40:40.396
Good hunting, Officer.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.983
I want Benetiz paroled
and the lab report redone right away.

40:44.066 --> 40:47.862
Captain, the guy was legally hired
by a bona fide lab, so what's the problem?

40:47.945 --> 40:51.407
The problem is your chemist
has been convicted of four felonies,

40:51.490 --> 40:54.869
and he got his degree at Harrisonville
for making license plates!

40:54.952 --> 40:56.412
Now get outta here and do your jobs right.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.080
Right, Captain.

41:01.542 --> 41:05.129
It's a case of misguided initiative.
Sorry.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.845
-You don't have--
-Dr. Thurston, I presume?

41:13.179 --> 41:14.638
You're coming with us, Sid.

41:15.931 --> 41:17.475
You might want in on this, Lieutenant.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.064
Come on, huh? Guys! Huh? <i>Que pasa!</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:26.525
Snitches court is now in session.

41:26.609 --> 41:30.362
Evidence, exhibit A, two grams of rock
found in the defendant's shirt pocket.

41:30.446 --> 41:32.781
Hey, come on, I went to bat for you guys.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.909
Snitches courts?
This is more like kangaroo court.

41:34.992 --> 41:38.329
Exhibit B, $100 found
in the defendant's pants pocket.

41:38.537 --> 41:39.705
Defendant will rise.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.123
The defendant, Sidney Thurston,

41:41.207 --> 41:44.210
is accused of the crime of rippin' off
certain controlled substances

41:44.293 --> 41:46.962
while trickin' for his employers
at Kruger's lab. What's the verdict?

41:47.046 --> 41:49.798
Verdict? What about the fair
and adequate defense part?

41:50.466 --> 41:51.842
-Guilty.
-Guilty.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.844
-On to sentencing.
-Come on! Wait!

41:53.928 --> 41:56.472
The jurors will keep in mind
the severity of the crimes,

41:56.555 --> 41:58.766
especially the fact that
the defendant cleared a bust

41:58.849 --> 42:01.727
and put his employers
in a jackpot with their boss.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.312
Listen, I didn't cop this stuff.

42:03.395 --> 42:05.564
What we're talkin' about
was taken to my private lab

42:05.648 --> 42:07.566
for some extracurricular testing.

42:07.816 --> 42:08.692
Well, jurors?

42:09.860 --> 42:10.986
One hundred dollar fine.

42:11.070 --> 42:14.615
Plus, ten pieces of information, gratis.

42:14.698 --> 42:15.658
I'm gonna fight this.

42:16.033 --> 42:18.619
Court's adjourned. The defendant can go.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.662
I'll go.

42:19.954 --> 42:23.123
But next time you need a chemist,
call Mr. Wizard.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.000
Geez, Norm.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.513
If you want to know what I decided
about discipline--

42:37.596 --> 42:38.597
I don't, I mean...

42:40.391 --> 42:43.143
that's not why I'm here,
I just want to talk to you.

42:43.894 --> 42:44.895
-About?
-About--

42:44.979 --> 42:47.231
Uh, I'm not happy with...

42:48.816 --> 42:50.234
(soft chuckle)

42:50.317 --> 42:52.611
I had a lot of trouble
bein' a cop today, Captain.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.490
I don't just mean the garbage.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.662
We rousted Cullen's men today.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.831
-"We?"
-A couple of the guys.

43:05.916 --> 43:06.959
After we talked?

43:08.544 --> 43:10.004
-Yeah.
-A roust?

43:12.464 --> 43:14.133
That's something we don't talk about,

43:15.175 --> 43:16.927
but a roust is something we sometimes do.

43:17.636 --> 43:21.849
But after this morning, Captain,
when I lost it, uh,

43:22.433 --> 43:23.684
when I lost control, I...

43:24.852 --> 43:27.187
You have the feeling you ran amuck,
Officer Hill?

43:28.272 --> 43:30.316
-Yeah, I guess so.
-Know that you're a good cop.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.152
-Most days.
-Know it.

43:39.241 --> 43:41.327
<i>This is Jensen Collier on location</i>

43:41.410 --> 43:44.163
<i>at the Cullen Drug King</i>
<i>funeral procession.</i>

43:44.747 --> 43:46.707
There must have been
a couple thousand people there.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.209
Can't really tell from the pictures.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.628
COLLIER (on TV):
<i>Try and touch the coffin...</i>

43:50.711 --> 43:52.212
I'm not guessin' from the TV.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.882
COLLIER (on TV):
<i>It's difficult to explain why so many...</i>

43:55.215 --> 43:56.925
I hooked school today to check it out.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.136
Does that make me bad?

44:01.847 --> 44:05.017
I'm not too crazy about
you're playing hooky.

44:05.100 --> 44:09.146
But no, Fabe, don't go thinkin'
bad thoughts about yourself.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.358
I mean, my mother
and my sister died from dope.

44:13.442 --> 44:17.237
And there I was chasin' some
pusher's funeral like it was a circus.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.407
-Fabe...
-(TV turns off)

44:21.575 --> 44:23.160
When I was a kid, um,

44:23.786 --> 44:26.163
a guy got shot at the barbershop
down the corner.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.582
Some hoodlum, you know, very big deal.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.168
You know how many Cadillacs
were at his funeral?

44:32.878 --> 44:33.712
Eleven.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.340
You know exactly 11?

44:36.882 --> 44:39.009
I know because I was
runnin' alongside countin' 'em.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.096
There was 20 there today.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.517
Yeah.

44:47.476 --> 44:51.063
Last year we take two weeks
at the beach, rains ten days.

44:51.647 --> 44:52.481
Never fails.

44:52.564 --> 44:57.111
Same thing happened the year before that.
Hailstorm, too. Hailstorm in August!

44:57.820 --> 45:01.031
WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units,</i>
<i>man with a shotgun sighted at 115th,</i>

<i>-one block south of Dekker, corner house.</i>
-(siren wails)

45:03.951 --> 45:06.453
Come on! Hey, look out, man!
He's got a shotgun!

45:06.537 --> 45:07.788
-Run! Run!
-You kids get outta here!

45:07.871 --> 45:10.082
-(gunshot)
-(indistinct)

45:10.165 --> 45:11.750
-(siren wailing)
-There he is.

45:12.626 --> 45:13.919
(tires screech)

45:14.545 --> 45:16.630
MARVIN: Come on, you suckers!

45:16.714 --> 45:19.216
-Police! Drop the weapon!
-Drop that gun now!

45:19.299 --> 45:20.509
-Watch it!
-Sir!

45:20.592 --> 45:22.761
(gunshots)

45:26.890 --> 45:28.559
John! No!

45:30.227 --> 45:31.270
No! (crying)

45:32.730 --> 45:35.941
(police radio indistinct)

45:48.996 --> 45:50.748
We told him twice. Twice, Captain.

45:50.831 --> 45:53.250
Yeah, we-we yelled, "drop the gun,"
and he wheels on us.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.501
He left us no way to go.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.378
OFFICER: I mean, what the hell?
Is he deaf or something?

45:56.462 --> 45:58.464
Yeah, as a matter of fact he was.

45:59.506 --> 46:00.758
Are you serious?

46:02.217 --> 46:03.051
OFFICER 2: Oh, man.

46:03.135 --> 46:05.304
Give your statements to SID,
then go take a breather.

46:11.643 --> 46:12.478
Wanna get a beer?

46:14.646 --> 46:15.481
Yeah.

46:22.821 --> 46:25.407
(jazz music playing)

46:25.783 --> 46:26.742
Here's to music.

46:29.870 --> 46:30.704
God love him.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.582
You like jazz?

46:36.084 --> 46:36.919
Sure.

46:39.129 --> 46:43.175
I mean, uh, I don't know
if I exactly understand it, but...

46:45.761 --> 46:48.013
if it's music, it's all right with me.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.849
If you don't like it,
I can put on something else.

46:52.309 --> 46:53.268
Hey, I love it.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.230
All music.

46:57.981 --> 46:59.858
Especially when somethin' bad's gone down.

47:01.527 --> 47:04.780
Without music,
I could lie in bed alone all night long,

47:04.863 --> 47:06.323
doin' instant replays.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.034
You know what I mean?

47:10.160 --> 47:11.829
Yeah, I know all about that.

47:17.042 --> 47:18.627
Patrick, is this wise?

47:42.401 --> 47:44.695
(closing theme playing)
