02:40.590 --> 02:42.050
I'm stuck.

02:50.980 --> 02:51.850
Get back!

03:37.942 --> 03:38.982
Mr. Tweedy!

03:40.442 --> 03:44.202
What is that chicken
doing outside the fence?

03:45.532 --> 03:49.412
I don't know, luv.
- Just deal with it. Now!

03:58.593 --> 04:02.223
I'll teach you
to make a fool out of me.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.473
Let that be a lesson to you!

04:08.893 --> 04:13.143
No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!

07:31.770 --> 07:32.810
Morning, Ginger.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.020
Back from holiday?
- I wasn't on holiday.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.860
I was in solitary confinement.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.280
It's nice to get a bit of time
to yourself, isn't it?

07:48.240 --> 07:51.371
Roll call!
Come along. You'll be late for parade.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.711
Pip, pip. Quick march.

07:54.121 --> 07:56.211
Left right...

07:56.631 --> 07:58.251
Come on, smarten up!

07:58.671 --> 08:00.211
Discipline! Order!

08:00.631 --> 08:04.171
Back in my RAF days,
when an officer called for a scramble,

08:04.591 --> 08:07.641
you'd hop in the old crate
and chocks away!

08:08.051 --> 08:11.221
Keep over, you old fool.
They just want to count us.

08:11.641 --> 08:14.561
How dare you talk back
to a senior ranking officer!

08:15.141 --> 08:18.521
Back in my RAF days...
- Fowler, they're coming.

08:18.811 --> 08:19.862
Right, right!

08:22.442 --> 08:25.862
There'll be a reprimand, lad.
You're grounded.

08:27.872 --> 08:29.452
Attention!

08:35.251 --> 08:38.542
Welcome back, hen.
Is there a new plan?

08:54.063 --> 08:56.813
We've already tried going under.

08:58.693 --> 09:00.233
Over. Right.

09:12.373 --> 09:15.253
How's the egg count?
- I laid 5 eggs today.

09:15.663 --> 09:17.873
Well chuffed with that, I was.

09:26.424 --> 09:27.724
Oh no.

09:32.514 --> 09:36.644
Why didn't you give her some of yours?
- She didn't tell me.

09:37.064 --> 09:38.644
She didn't tell anyone.

09:49.705 --> 09:51.825
Is Edwina off on holiday?

10:50.557 --> 10:52.597
We've got to get out of here.

10:54.397 --> 10:57.977
Are we still on?
- We're on, all right.

10:58.397 --> 11:01.447
Spread the word, Mac.
Meeting tonight in Hut 17.

11:29.638 --> 11:30.678
You called?

11:31.218 --> 11:33.598
Nick and...
- Fetcher. - At your service.

11:39.358 --> 11:40.818
Over here.

11:44.608 --> 11:47.909
We need more things.
- Right you are, Miss.

11:48.329 --> 11:50.289
How about this quality tea set?

11:50.699 --> 11:52.199
A lovely necklace and pendant.

11:52.619 --> 11:57.039
Or this number. All the rage in
the fashionable Paris chicken coops.

11:57.669 --> 12:01.129
Simply pop it on,
and as the French say: "Voila!"

12:01.549 --> 12:02.799
That is French.

12:03.219 --> 12:07.509
It's two hats in one, Miss.
For parties. For weddings.

12:08.849 --> 12:11.309
Madame, you look like a vision,
like a dream.

12:11.719 --> 12:14.349
Like a duck.
- No, thank you.

12:14.769 --> 12:18.150
We're making this. We need this.
Can you get it?

12:20.520 --> 12:23.990
This is a big job, Miss.
Bigger than the others.

12:24.400 --> 12:28.160
This will cost.
- The usual: One bag of seed.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.780
You call this pay?
- It's chicken feed.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.790
What could we give you?
- Eggs.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.370
We can't. Our eggs are too valuable.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.170
So are we.

12:41.670 --> 12:42.750
After you, Fetcher.

12:45.011 --> 12:46.051
After I what?

12:46.801 --> 12:48.301
Move!

13:12.951 --> 13:15.372
Stupid, worthless creatures!

13:16.712 --> 13:20.082
I'm sick and tired
of making minuscule profits.

13:41.312 --> 13:42.612
Oh, yes.

13:43.482 --> 13:45.403
Those chickens are up to something.

13:45.823 --> 13:48.703
Quiet.
I'm onto something.

13:49.113 --> 13:50.613
They're organized.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.453
Quiet!
- That ginger one

13:53.873 --> 13:55.043
is their leader.

13:57.793 --> 14:01.213
I may have found a way
to make some real money.

14:01.633 --> 14:05.503
What are you on about? Ridiculous
notions of escaping chickens.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.633
It's all in your head,
Mr. Tweedy. Say it.

14:11.053 --> 14:13.143
It's all in my head.

14:13.554 --> 14:16.014
Now you keep telling yourself that,

14:16.434 --> 14:20.444
because I won't hear another word
about it. Is that clear?

14:20.854 --> 14:22.904
Yes, luv.

14:23.314 --> 14:24.274
But the ginger one!

14:24.694 --> 14:28.234
They're chickens, you dolt!
Apart from you,

14:28.654 --> 14:31.324
they're the most stupid creatures
on the planet!

14:31.744 --> 14:34.204
They don't plot,
they don't scheme,

14:34.624 --> 14:36.704
and they're not organized!

14:37.914 --> 14:40.374
Order! Order!

14:40.794 --> 14:42.674
Quiet, everyone.

14:43.085 --> 14:44.585
Settle down.

14:45.005 --> 14:48.845
I would like to call to order...
- Quiet!

14:49.925 --> 14:52.475
Discipline in the ranks!
What! What!

14:52.885 --> 14:55.685
Thank you, Fowler.
- In my RAF days, we never wasted time

14:56.105 --> 15:00.025
with unnecessary chitchat.
- Yes, thank you, Fowler.

15:05.065 --> 15:06.405
Right.

15:09.905 --> 15:11.155
Carry on.

15:13.286 --> 15:17.206
Our last escape attempt
was a bit of a fiasco,

15:17.626 --> 15:19.916
but Mac and I have a new plan.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.506
Show them, Mac. - We tried going
under that wire, and it didn't work.

15:24.926 --> 15:27.176
So the plan is: We go

15:27.596 --> 15:29.176
over it.

15:30.346 --> 15:34.016
This is us, right?
We get in like this

15:34.436 --> 15:36.766
and wind her up, and

15:37.186 --> 15:37.896
let her go!

15:43.317 --> 15:46.527
Good grief!
The turnip's bought it.

15:49.447 --> 15:50.867
Farmer's coming!

15:55.957 --> 15:57.577
Operation Cover-Up!

16:25.488 --> 16:27.238
Mr. Tweedy,

16:28.358 --> 16:29.818
where are you?

16:31.028 --> 16:33.658
It's all in your head.

16:38.878 --> 16:42.129
Think, everyone.
What haven't we tried yet?

16:43.459 --> 16:45.879
We haven't tried
not trying to escape.

16:46.799 --> 16:47.839
Might work.

16:49.219 --> 16:50.639
What about Edwina?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.519
How many more empty nests
will it take?

16:54.929 --> 16:57.639
Maybe she should have spent more time
laying eggs

16:58.059 --> 17:00.609
and less time escaping.
- Laying eggs,

17:01.019 --> 17:04.279
then getting plucked and roasted
is good enough for you?

17:05.489 --> 17:06.569
It's a living.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.530
The fences aren't just
around the farm.

17:10.950 --> 17:13.660
They're up here in your heads.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.250
There is a better place out there.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.329
Somewhere beyond that hill,

17:19.920 --> 17:23.170
it has wide open spaces
and lots of trees.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.170
And grass. Can you imagine that?

17:27.589 --> 17:29.800
Cool, green grass.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.470
Who feeds us?

17:32.050 --> 17:34.310
We feed ourselves.
- Where's the farm?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.850
There is no farm.
- Then where does the farmer live?

17:38.270 --> 17:40.941
There is no farmer.
- Is he on holiday?

17:41.351 --> 17:43.561
He isn't anywhere.
Don't you get it?

17:43.981 --> 17:46.191
No egg count,
no farmers, no dogs,

17:46.611 --> 17:49.781
no coops and keys
and no fences!

17:51.281 --> 17:55.331
In all my life
I've never heard such a fantastic

17:55.741 --> 17:57.451
load of tripe!

17:58.961 --> 18:00.921
Face the facts, ducks.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.791
The chance of us getting out
are a million to one.

18:05.961 --> 18:07.671
Then there's still a chance!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.282
Oh, no!

18:32.702 --> 18:35.952
Who am I fooling?
I can't lead this bunch of...

18:40.833 --> 18:42.793
Heaven help us.

18:52.473 --> 18:55.643
Freedom!

19:14.744 --> 19:17.334
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a wonderful audience.

19:35.514 --> 19:37.144
That's it.

19:38.935 --> 19:40.105
Inside, quickly!

19:47.615 --> 19:49.275
Here's our way out!

19:49.695 --> 19:51.155
We'll make posters?

19:52.035 --> 19:56.075
What's on the posters, Babs?
We'll fly out.

19:56.495 --> 20:00.205
Must be important to be on a poster.
I wonder what he does.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.505
Obviously,
he's a professional flying rooster.

20:03.915 --> 20:06.215
Flies around giving demonstrations.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.756
Do you suppose?
- Absolutely!

20:10.006 --> 20:11.306
No, not in there!

20:11.716 --> 20:13.176
Get out!

20:20.516 --> 20:24.026
Who are you? Where am I?
What happened to my wing?

20:24.436 --> 20:26.856
You took a nasty fall.
- Spraining the anterior tendon

20:27.276 --> 20:30.946
connecting the radius to the humerus.
I wrapped it.

20:31.366 --> 20:33.866
Was that English?
- She fixed your wing.

20:34.246 --> 20:37.037
I made the bandage.
- I carried you in.

20:42.587 --> 20:44.957
Back up and start from the top.
Where am I?

20:45.377 --> 20:50.387
How rude of us. We're just excited...
This is a chicken farm.

20:50.797 --> 20:52.467
And we're the chickens.

20:53.217 --> 20:55.267
With you so far.
Chicken farm, chickens.

20:55.977 --> 20:57.637
I don't like his look.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.897
His eyes are too close together.

21:00.307 --> 21:04.147
And he's a Yank! - Cockfighting's
illegal where I come from.

21:04.567 --> 21:09.198
Where is that? - A place I call
home of the free, land of the brave.

21:09.608 --> 21:10.698
Scotland!

21:11.118 --> 21:12.698
No! America.

21:15.998 --> 21:17.288
Poppycock!

21:17.708 --> 21:20.748
Pushy Americans.
Always showing up late for every war.

21:21.748 --> 21:25.338
Overpaid, oversexed
and over here.

21:25.748 --> 21:29.468
What's eating grandpa?
- Don't mind him, Mister...

21:29.878 --> 21:33.468
My name's Rocky, the Rhode Island Red.
Rhodes for short.

21:33.888 --> 21:35.258
Rocky Rhodes!

21:35.679 --> 21:37.219
Catchy, ain't it?

21:38.229 --> 21:40.229
Mr. Rhodes, is this you?

21:41.559 --> 21:43.689
Who wants to know?

21:44.109 --> 21:47.689
A group of desperate chickens.
If it's you,

21:48.109 --> 21:50.109
you may be the answer to our prayers.

21:54.449 --> 21:58.449
Then call me a miracle, dollface,
'cause that's me.

21:59.869 --> 22:02.579
What brings you to England,
Mr. Rhodes?

22:03.169 --> 22:05.630
All the beautiful English chicks,
of course.

22:06.050 --> 22:07.880
Give over!

22:09.800 --> 22:14.180
I'm a traveler.
I did that barnyard thing for a while,

22:14.600 --> 22:17.220
but couldn't get into it.
Hi. How are you?

22:17.640 --> 22:18.560
Nope!

22:18.970 --> 22:23.230
The open road is more my style.
Put a pack on my back

22:23.650 --> 22:25.400
and point me where the wind blows.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.480
Know what they call me back home?

22:28.900 --> 22:32.490
You'll love this.
The Lone Free-Ranger.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.411
Isn't that great?

22:36.081 --> 22:38.081
I knew it was possible.
- It's possible!

22:38.491 --> 22:39.871
The answer had to come!
- Amen!

22:40.291 --> 22:44.541
We'll fly over that fence, and
Mr. Rhodes will show us how. Right?

22:44.961 --> 22:48.921
That's ri... What?
Did you say "fly?"

22:49.341 --> 22:51.881
You can teach us.
- No, I can't.

22:52.301 --> 22:53.801
Listen! You hear that?

22:55.761 --> 22:58.851
The open road's calling,
and I have to answer.

22:59.431 --> 23:00.391
Bye.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.811
He must have very good hearing.

23:04.942 --> 23:07.562
Okay, where's the exit?
This way.

23:07.982 --> 23:12.032
Mr. Rhodes? Perhaps I didn't explain
our situation properly.

23:12.442 --> 23:14.412
We lay eggs, day in, day out.

23:14.822 --> 23:17.242
When we can't lay any more,
they kill us.

23:18.242 --> 23:21.582
It's a cruel world, dollface.
Better get used to it.

23:22.002 --> 23:24.622
Which part of "they kill us"
don't you understand?

23:25.042 --> 23:26.752
I got my own set of problems.

23:27.172 --> 23:29.422
Besides, it can't be
that hard to bust out of here.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.962
Watch me.

23:32.922 --> 23:37.513
It's not so hard for a chicken or two
to get out, but it's about all of us.

23:40.223 --> 23:44.563
All of you? - I've been trying
to tell you. - Let's get it straight.

23:44.983 --> 23:48.733
You want to get every chicken
out of here at once?

23:49.153 --> 23:51.863
Of course.
- You're certifiable.

23:52.283 --> 23:55.783
You can't pull that off.
- Where there's a will, there's a way.

23:56.203 --> 24:00.333
Couldn't agree more.
And I will be leaving. That way.

24:01.033 --> 24:03.044
Mr. Rhodes, please!

24:25.604 --> 24:28.354
So that's it.
You're from the circus.

24:30.404 --> 24:32.325
You're on the run, aren't you?

24:33.235 --> 24:36.995
Keep it down!
I'm trying to lay low here.

24:38.075 --> 24:41.455
I should turn you in right now.
- You wouldn't.

24:41.875 --> 24:43.665
Would you?
- Why not?

24:44.085 --> 24:46.255
Because I'm cute?

24:50.295 --> 24:52.795
Hey, hey. You crazy chick!

24:53.215 --> 24:56.095
You know what'll happen
if he finds me? - It's a cruel world.

24:56.515 --> 24:59.845
I don't like you.
- I don't care.

25:00.265 --> 25:03.976
Show us how to fly. - With this wing?
- Teach us, then.

25:06.736 --> 25:08.946
He's valuable, you say?

25:09.356 --> 25:11.406
Sure.
- Get the torch.

25:11.866 --> 25:14.576
Listen here, sister.
I'm not going back to that life.

25:14.986 --> 25:17.576
I'm a Lone Free-Ranger.
Emphasis on "free."

25:17.996 --> 25:20.496
And that's what we want...
freedom.

25:24.796 --> 25:26.506
Fancy that, they're coming.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.626
Oh, no! They're onto me!

25:29.046 --> 25:32.717
Teach us to fly. We'll hide you.
- And if I don't?

25:33.927 --> 25:36.597
Was your father by any chance
a vulture?

25:37.267 --> 25:39.387
Do we have a deal?

25:58.197 --> 26:02.498
Time to make good on that deal,
dollface. - The name is Ginger.

26:20.228 --> 26:22.098
Comfortable?
- Not really.

26:22.518 --> 26:24.438
Maybe this will help.

26:26.768 --> 26:29.898
Nice hideout.
I had more room in my egg.

26:30.319 --> 26:33.529
We held up our end of it.
Tomorrow you hold up yours.

26:33.949 --> 26:35.569
What deal?
- Flying.

26:35.989 --> 26:39.409
Oh, yeah. Don't worry.
I'll teach you everything I know.

26:39.829 --> 26:42.789
Which bunk is mine?

26:45.629 --> 26:48.879
Absolutely outrageous!

26:49.299 --> 26:51.839
Asking a senior officer
to share his quarters.

26:52.259 --> 26:54.839
And with a non-commissioned Yank,
no less!

26:55.259 --> 26:57.049
Why, back in my day...

26:57.469 --> 26:59.970
You weren't exactly
my first choice either.

27:00.810 --> 27:03.100
Scoot over. Your wing's
on my side of the bunk.

27:03.520 --> 27:08.190
Your side of the bunk?
The whole bunk is my side!

27:09.320 --> 27:12.440
What is that smell?
Is that your breath?

27:12.860 --> 27:15.700
Absolutely outrageous!

27:21.240 --> 27:24.210
So you want to fly, huh?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.420
Well, it ain't going to be easy. And
it ain't going to happen overnight.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.461
Flying takes three things:
Hard work,

27:31.881 --> 27:33.631
perseverance and

27:35.261 --> 27:37.761
hard work.
- You said "hard work" twice!

27:38.181 --> 27:41.261
Because it takes twice as much
hard work as perseverance.

27:43.061 --> 27:44.561
Codswallop!

27:44.981 --> 27:47.231
Cocky Yanks
think they know it all.

27:48.191 --> 27:52.481
The most important thing is
we have to work as a team.

27:53.441 --> 27:56.611
Which means,
you do everything I tell you.

28:00.492 --> 28:02.872
Let's rock 'n roll.

28:44.043 --> 28:45.703
The chickens are...

28:46.793 --> 28:48.123
...pecking?

28:49.503 --> 28:51.843
And left, two, three.

28:52.173 --> 28:53.963
And right, two, three.

28:54.383 --> 28:55.923
And stop right there.

28:56.723 --> 28:58.554
Yes, down.

28:59.224 --> 29:01.854
Make little circles.

29:02.264 --> 29:03.764
Faster.

29:08.184 --> 29:10.024
Oh, that's the spot!

29:20.704 --> 29:23.534
I thought
you were going to teach us to fly.

29:23.954 --> 29:26.124
That's what I'm doing.

29:26.544 --> 29:29.255
Isn't there usually
some flapping involved?

29:30.335 --> 29:32.335
Do I tell you how to lay eggs?

29:32.755 --> 29:35.175
Relax.
We're making progress.

29:35.595 --> 29:39.095
Really? I can't help feeling
we're going around in circles.

29:40.635 --> 29:44.685
Hey, cut it out!
You're making me dizzy.

29:45.105 --> 29:47.065
They're ready to fly now.

29:47.475 --> 29:49.525
Good, 'cause they can't walk anymore.

29:52.565 --> 29:53.815
Up and at 'em!

29:54.235 --> 29:55.365
Let's flap.

30:00.746 --> 30:04.706
Let's see if old Attila the Hen
has come to her senses.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.506
It's raining hen!

30:19.386 --> 30:23.386
What's this caper, luv?
- We're flying. - Obviously.

30:24.976 --> 30:28.687
Flipping hell. Look at this.
- They're going to kill themselves.

30:29.607 --> 30:32.277
Want to watch?
- All right.

30:43.577 --> 30:45.917
Careful of those eggs!

30:50.547 --> 30:52.417
Sunny-side up.

30:55.548 --> 30:56.928
Now over easy.

30:59.848 --> 31:01.558
Definitely scrambled.

31:08.898 --> 31:10.978
Poultry in motion.

31:25.039 --> 31:27.329
Birds of a feather
flop together.

31:33.169 --> 31:34.839
Great work, ladies.

31:35.259 --> 31:38.299
The pain you're feeling
is a good thing.

31:38.719 --> 31:40.139
Pain is your friend.

31:40.559 --> 31:44.229
Just keep the faith...
Agnes. You'll get there.

31:44.639 --> 31:46.349
You flew four feet today.

31:46.769 --> 31:50.229
Yeah, four feet.
From the roof to the ground.

31:50.649 --> 31:55.280
All part of the process. Don't worry.
You cheesy little...

31:58.490 --> 32:00.450
That doesn't sound good.

32:01.410 --> 32:04.080
The ground's shaking.
Are we worried?

32:04.750 --> 32:06.160
Are we worried?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.630
The circus! Quick! Hide me!

32:16.050 --> 32:17.880
Hide me!
- Come on.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.680
One isn't awarded a medal

32:20.090 --> 32:22.970
for flapping about like a lunatic.

32:24.471 --> 32:27.021
Now see here!
This is an officer's quarters!

32:27.441 --> 32:29.231
In here!
- Get out of here now!

32:29.731 --> 32:31.521
Give it a rest, Pops!

32:32.401 --> 32:35.441
What? I shall have you
on charges within the week!

33:13.652 --> 33:14.692
Cheers, mate.

33:22.492 --> 33:24.873
It's all in your head.

33:34.593 --> 33:36.593
What's all this?

33:37.003 --> 33:38.923
This is our future, Mr. Tweedy.

33:39.343 --> 33:41.883
No more wasting time
with petty egg collection

33:42.303 --> 33:44.643
and minuscule profits.
- No eggs?

33:45.053 --> 33:47.723
We've always been egg farmers.
My father,

33:48.143 --> 33:50.603
his father and their fathers.
They were always...

33:51.023 --> 33:54.444
Poor! Worthless! Nothings!

33:54.864 --> 33:56.524
But that's about to change.

33:56.944 --> 34:00.034
This will take Tweedy's farm
out of the Dark Ages

34:00.444 --> 34:04.124
and into full-scale
automated production.

34:06.204 --> 34:09.083
Melisha Tweedy
will be poor no longer.

34:13.004 --> 34:15.043
I'll put it together,
shall I?

34:21.424 --> 34:24.475
That isn't good.
Whatever's in those boxes is for us.

34:24.895 --> 34:26.764
And I doubt it's softer than hay.

34:27.185 --> 34:29.395
I hate to be the voice of doom,

34:29.815 --> 34:34.235
but I've been calculating.
I don't think we're built for flying.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.945
But I saw him!
He flew in over that fence!

34:38.445 --> 34:40.074
I believe you,

34:40.485 --> 34:44.415
but if we could see it for ourselves
it might answer some questions.

34:45.245 --> 34:48.955
You're right. We've been at this
all week. We're getting nowhere.

34:49.375 --> 34:53.666
If his wing were better...
I'll talk to him.

35:00.636 --> 35:02.016
Where is he?

35:02.426 --> 35:05.346
They didn't give me this medal
for being a Yank nanny.

35:06.516 --> 35:08.766
"I don't know" would suffice.

35:09.186 --> 35:12.396
Beware of that one,
young Ginger.

35:12.816 --> 35:15.236
That Yank is not to be trusted.

35:16.026 --> 35:19.196
That Yank
is our ticket out of here.

35:19.616 --> 35:23.617
And the pig says to the horse,
"Why the long face?"

35:29.837 --> 35:31.127
Cocktail!

35:31.957 --> 35:32.837
Give over!

35:40.177 --> 35:41.927
So anyway...

35:42.767 --> 35:45.477
Remember those flying tips.

35:45.887 --> 35:48.687
They're very important.
And think flighty thoughts.

35:52.068 --> 35:53.648
They're swell chicks.

35:54.068 --> 35:57.818
Look what Babs made me. A beak warmer.
Isn't that cute?

35:59.528 --> 36:03.538
And that Bunty.
She really packs a pun.

36:03.948 --> 36:05.038
A problem?

36:05.448 --> 36:08.828
Have we flown over the fence?
- Not quite. - There's a problem.

36:09.248 --> 36:10.998
Good things come to those who wait.

36:21.799 --> 36:25.849
How long did it take you?
- To do what? - To learn to fly.

36:26.269 --> 36:29.099
Apples and oranges.
I'm gifted, they're not.

36:29.519 --> 36:33.729
You can't compare the two.
These things take time.

36:34.149 --> 36:38.319
Which we're running out of. Why
haven't we lifted off yet? - Thrust.

36:38.859 --> 36:42.949
I went over my calculations.
What we're missing is thrust.

36:46.749 --> 36:48.249
I didn't get a word of that.

36:48.659 --> 36:52.750
Thrust. When ducks and geese take off,
what do they have?

36:53.130 --> 36:55.300
She ain't using real words.

36:55.710 --> 36:58.340
She said we need more thrust.
- Thrust!

36:58.760 --> 37:02.430
Sure. Thrust and flying
are like this.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.050
Flying and thrust.

37:04.470 --> 37:06.390
Will you excuse us?

37:08.020 --> 37:09.230
The wing!

37:09.640 --> 37:12.730
No results by tomorrow,
and the deal's off.

37:13.150 --> 37:17.900
No more hiding. The farmers'll find
you and back to the circus, fly boy.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.491
You're the first chick I ever met
with the shell still on.

37:24.071 --> 37:27.041
Sleep tight, ángel face.
The Rock's on the case.

37:39.551 --> 37:41.341
What? What?

37:43.141 --> 37:44.801
A beaut. A fine piece of work.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.561
If I do say so myself.

37:47.971 --> 37:50.642
I say so myself, too.
- Wish I'd seen it.

37:51.062 --> 37:54.902
We slipped into the farmer's room.
- Like a fish.

37:55.312 --> 37:56.482
And we...

37:57.612 --> 37:59.152
Like a fish?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.952
You stupid idiot!

38:02.362 --> 38:04.072
Anyway, here it is.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.622
El merchandiso!
- That's Spanish.

38:07.032 --> 38:08.912
What're these two crooks doing here?

38:09.332 --> 38:13.082
So, you know each other!
- She don't think we're valuable.

38:13.502 --> 38:14.962
You guys are

38:15.382 --> 38:18.883
the sneakiest,
thieving parasites I've ever met.

38:19.303 --> 38:22.843
Don't. Stop it.
- I've gone bright red.

38:23.263 --> 38:24.803
So, how about the eggs?

38:25.223 --> 38:27.013
Eggs? You promised them...

38:27.433 --> 38:29.723
Yep, I promised them
every egg I lay this month.

38:30.143 --> 38:33.063
When can we expect
the first one?

38:33.483 --> 38:36.813
I'm brewing one up now.
I'll keep you posted.

38:38.273 --> 38:40.983
A pleasure doing business
with you.

38:41.823 --> 38:43.153
Sucker.

38:45.203 --> 38:47.033
What?
- You lied to them.

38:47.454 --> 38:51.874
I didn't lie, dollface.
I just omitted certain truths.

38:52.294 --> 38:55.544
I'll give them what I promised.
- Nothing. - Which they'll get.

38:55.964 --> 38:58.134
And what will you give us?

38:59.174 --> 39:00.884
Thrust.

39:03.264 --> 39:05.134
You okay, sweetheart? Good, good.

39:08.354 --> 39:12.224
Now this will get you going.
It's a thrust exercise.

39:12.644 --> 39:16.024
The tension's killing me.
- It's gonna kill her.

39:16.444 --> 39:17.525
Release!

39:22.995 --> 39:25.205
Come on, flap!

39:28.825 --> 39:30.585
You can do it. Flap!

39:40.425 --> 39:43.265
Is that your first of-fence?

39:58.526 --> 40:00.196
Roll call!

40:00.816 --> 40:02.196
I haven't laid any eggs.

40:02.616 --> 40:04.826
Three days, not one.

40:06.116 --> 40:08.956
Why didn't you tell us?
- I was so busy flying...

40:09.366 --> 40:11.166
They're coming!
- Hide me!

40:11.586 --> 40:13.586
Hide yourself!

41:15.269 --> 41:17.109
Double their food rations.

41:17.989 --> 41:20.489
I want them all as fat as this one.

41:25.279 --> 41:28.449
All of my life
flashed before my eyes.

41:29.829 --> 41:31.419
It was really boring.

41:34.129 --> 41:35.249
Chicken feed!

41:35.839 --> 41:37.589
My favorite!

41:38.299 --> 41:39.419
Wait!

41:46.760 --> 41:47.810
No, wait!

41:51.100 --> 41:52.940
Babs, please! Bunty.

41:53.350 --> 41:55.310
Stop it! Wait!

41:55.730 --> 41:57.270
Stop!

42:02.780 --> 42:03.820
Stop it!

42:05.990 --> 42:09.660
Something is wrong here.
Can't you see that?

42:11.660 --> 42:14.671
Strange boxes arrive.
Babs stops laying,

42:15.081 --> 42:17.461
but she isn't taken to the chop.
Extra food.

42:17.881 --> 42:20.921
Don't you see?
They're fattening us up.

42:21.341 --> 42:22.881
They're going to kill us all!

42:26.471 --> 42:28.391
Heavy alert!

42:29.101 --> 42:33.351
She didn't mean that, gals.
- Do you mind? - Save some for me.

42:33.771 --> 42:35.441
What are you doing?

42:36.441 --> 42:37.481
Let go!

42:37.901 --> 42:42.031
I've met some hard-boiled eggs before,
but you're about 20 minutes.

42:42.441 --> 42:45.112
Meaning what?
- Meaning, lighten up.

42:45.532 --> 42:48.582
In America we have a rule:
To motivate someone,

42:48.992 --> 42:50.452
don't mention death!

42:51.122 --> 42:54.372
Funny. Over here the rule is:
Always tell the truth!

42:54.792 --> 42:56.792
It's been working like a charm.

42:57.212 --> 43:00.922
You want them to perform,
tell them what they want to hear.

43:01.342 --> 43:03.052
You mean lie?

43:03.472 --> 43:04.972
Here we go again.

43:05.382 --> 43:08.852
Know what your problem is?
You're... difficult.

43:09.262 --> 43:11.142
Why? Because I'm honest?

43:11.562 --> 43:15.273
I care about them.
Something the Lone Free-Ranger

43:15.693 --> 43:19.363
doesn't know about.
- Then I hope you never care about me.

43:19.773 --> 43:22.113
I never will.
- Good. - Fine.

44:12.415 --> 44:13.745
What's all this?

44:15.125 --> 44:18.045
Here she is.
Ask and you shall receive.

44:18.585 --> 44:21.505
That's biblical.
- That's real craftsmanship.

44:21.925 --> 44:23.385
Solid as a rock.

44:26.135 --> 44:27.675
It's supposed to do that.

44:28.635 --> 44:30.055
Perfect, guys.

44:30.725 --> 44:32.105
How's that egg coming?

44:32.515 --> 44:35.525
This is a double yolker.

44:44.656 --> 44:47.446
I don't see what it has to do with...
- You will.

44:48.456 --> 44:52.916
We've been working hard. Let's relax
and shake those tail feathers.

44:53.326 --> 44:56.496
Look at him!
Nellpodging around like a...

44:56.916 --> 44:57.916
Good heavens!

44:58.336 --> 44:59.506
What's happening?

44:59.916 --> 45:02.086
That's called a beat. Feel it

45:02.506 --> 45:04.966
pulsing through your body?

45:05.386 --> 45:07.216
Oh yes. Who'd have guessed?

45:07.636 --> 45:09.556
Then go with it, baby!

45:13.647 --> 45:15.437
Look, I'm going with it!

45:15.857 --> 45:17.897
Bunty, what's got into you?

45:18.317 --> 45:20.447
Same thing that's got into you.

45:23.697 --> 45:25.407
Just go with the flow.

45:33.787 --> 45:36.837
I don't recall
authorizing a hop.

45:37.247 --> 45:39.047
Shut up and dance.

45:46.598 --> 45:49.638
What are you sobbing about,
you nancy?

45:50.058 --> 45:51.768
Little moments like this...

45:52.188 --> 45:55.518
it's what makes the job
all worthwhile.

45:58.978 --> 46:00.568
Want to dance?

46:04.068 --> 46:05.108
Yeah, all right.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.080
Did you see that? I flew!

46:53.500 --> 46:55.710
Atta girl, Babsy! Atta girl.

46:56.460 --> 46:58.750
Your wing! It's better!

47:00.210 --> 47:01.880
How about that?
- Fantastic!

47:02.300 --> 47:05.300
You can fly for us tomorrow.

47:05.720 --> 47:07.680
Yeah, so it seems.

47:08.090 --> 47:09.931
I flew!

47:11.431 --> 47:13.471
I owe you an apology.

47:13.891 --> 47:16.811
I didn't think you cared,
but after all this...

47:17.231 --> 47:19.731
Well, it seems I was wrong.

47:20.321 --> 47:22.651
Easy, Miss Hard-Boiled.

47:23.071 --> 47:25.191
I might think you're turning soft.

47:30.781 --> 47:33.911
Listen.
I have to tell you something.

47:42.052 --> 47:44.462
No! You'd better wait.

48:09.073 --> 48:12.083
That's champion...
What is it?

48:12.493 --> 48:15.083
A pie machine, you idiot. Chickens

48:15.503 --> 48:19.833
go in. Pies come out.
- What kind of pies?

48:20.253 --> 48:21.293
Apple.

48:21.713 --> 48:22.593
My favorite.

48:23.003 --> 48:27.803
Chicken pies, you lummox!
Lmagine:

48:28.383 --> 48:33.353
In less than a fortnight, every grocer
will be stocked with boxes

48:33.763 --> 48:37.564
of Mrs. Tweedy's
Homemade Chicken Pies.

48:37.984 --> 48:42.364
Just "Mrs."? - Woman's touch.
Makes the public feel comfortable.

48:43.364 --> 48:45.484
Oh, right. How does it work?

48:45.904 --> 48:48.864
Get me a chicken,
and I'll show you.

48:50.284 --> 48:52.704
I know just the one.

48:56.794 --> 48:59.544
I've got a score to settle with you.

48:59.964 --> 49:02.124
Bloomin' heck! They've got Ginger!

49:07.425 --> 49:10.345
We mustn't panic! We mustn't panic!

49:14.265 --> 49:17.275
Quiet, I say!
Let's have some discipline!

49:17.685 --> 49:20.185
The enemy has a prisoner.
This calls

49:20.605 --> 49:24.905
for retaliation! Retaliation!
- What's going on?

49:25.315 --> 49:28.995
They got Ginger.
They're taking her to the chop!

49:29.405 --> 49:31.155
What are you waiting for, laddie?

49:31.575 --> 49:32.995
Fly over there. Save her.

49:33.415 --> 49:35.586
Of course! No!

49:35.996 --> 49:40.046
Just what they'd expect.
Give them the old element of surprise!

49:40.456 --> 49:43.216
And catch Jerry
with his trousers down!

49:43.626 --> 49:45.296
I like that. What's the plan?

49:45.716 --> 49:47.756
The plan...

49:48.176 --> 49:49.766
The plan... Babs!

49:50.176 --> 49:53.096
Give me that thing.
Bunty, give me a boost.

50:07.577 --> 50:09.657
Look at the size of that thing.

50:14.037 --> 50:15.117
Oh, no.

50:17.037 --> 50:18.747
Chickens go in,

50:19.457 --> 50:21.007
pies come out.

50:25.337 --> 50:27.717
Chicken pies. Not apple pies.

50:28.137 --> 50:29.637
Chicken!

50:37.058 --> 50:39.268
Great! Brilliant!

50:39.688 --> 50:40.778
Yo! Baby doll!

50:41.818 --> 50:43.568
I'm coming!
- Hurry!

50:45.448 --> 50:48.778
I'm still coming!
- Come on! Stop this thing!

50:49.528 --> 50:50.948
I'm getting there.

50:53.868 --> 50:55.118
Shoot!

50:57.578 --> 50:59.918
I'll be down before you can say...

51:00.588 --> 51:02.168
mixed vegetables?

51:24.359 --> 51:25.489
D'oh! Get it?

51:25.899 --> 51:27.609
Dough.
- I'm stuck!

51:28.029 --> 51:29.409
Nothing to it.

51:46.260 --> 51:47.300
Hang on.

51:52.760 --> 51:53.810
Look out.

52:26.841 --> 52:29.301
It's like an oven in here.

52:38.522 --> 52:39.732
Come on!

52:43.232 --> 52:44.272
Wait!

52:45.322 --> 52:46.732
Go over to the...

52:58.582 --> 53:00.332
The door! Come on!

53:23.693 --> 53:26.903
She's gonna blow! Run!

53:31.864 --> 53:35.954
What did you do,
you great pudding? - Nothing.

53:44.424 --> 53:47.294
Turn it off!
- It won't turn off!

54:12.745 --> 54:14.865
We've got to show the others. Come on!

54:24.005 --> 54:26.085
Look. I fixed it.

54:30.466 --> 54:32.466
Chicken pies?

54:33.516 --> 54:34.556
Yes, but...

54:34.976 --> 54:37.476
I don't want to be a pie!

54:37.896 --> 54:39.816
I don't like gravy.

54:40.726 --> 54:43.106
Ladies,
let's not lose our heads.

54:43.526 --> 54:44.776
Lose our heads?

54:53.406 --> 54:57.996
What I meant was, Rocky sabotaged
the machine and bought us more time.

54:58.746 --> 55:02.167
And better still,
he's going to fly for us tomorrow.

55:02.587 --> 55:05.377
Once we see how,
I know we'll get it.

55:05.797 --> 55:10.717
So don't worry. Tomorrow everything
is going to go much smoother.

55:21.107 --> 55:23.357
Alright, Pops,
what did I do now?

55:23.777 --> 55:25.857
A very brave and honorable deed.

55:28.357 --> 55:31.408
In the light of your action today,

55:31.828 --> 55:35.408
I dutifully admit
that I misjudged your character.

55:36.998 --> 55:39.578
I present you
with this medal for bravery.

55:42.168 --> 55:44.418
And I salute you.

55:48.338 --> 55:49.678
In honor of this occasion,

55:50.088 --> 55:52.548
I surrender the bunk entirely.

55:52.968 --> 55:56.018
I shall sleep under the stars.

55:59.059 --> 56:04.939
I await tomorrow's flying
demonstration with great anticipation.

56:07.779 --> 56:09.949
You and me both, Pops.

56:19.829 --> 56:22.039
Oh, were you...?
- Is this your...?

56:22.459 --> 56:25.629
Since you're here...
- I'm glad you're here...

56:26.049 --> 56:28.550
You go first.
- You go ahead.

56:30.970 --> 56:35.140
I just wanted to say, I may have been
a bit harsh at first...

56:35.560 --> 56:38.680
What I really mean is...

56:39.270 --> 56:40.440
thank you

56:40.940 --> 56:43.110
for saving my life.

56:43.520 --> 56:45.730
For saving our lives.

56:46.270 --> 56:49.740
You know,
I come up here every night

56:50.150 --> 56:54.320
and look at that hill, imagining
what it's like on the other side.

56:54.990 --> 56:56.910
It's funny...

56:57.330 --> 57:01.371
I've never actually felt grass
beneath my feet. I'm sorry.

57:02.211 --> 57:05.791
I'm rambling on about grass,
and you had something to say.

57:09.301 --> 57:11.471
It's just that...

57:12.181 --> 57:15.851
life, as I've experienced it,
out there

57:16.261 --> 57:18.681
lone free-ranging and stuff...

57:19.181 --> 57:21.771
It's full of disappointments.

57:22.191 --> 57:24.691
So grass isn't all
it's cracked up to be?

57:25.111 --> 57:29.782
Grass! Exactly.
It's always greener on the other side.

57:30.192 --> 57:32.322
And then you get there,

57:32.742 --> 57:36.452
and it's brown and prickly.
See what I'm saying?

57:40.622 --> 57:42.622
What I'm trying to say is...

57:46.752 --> 57:48.422
you're welcome.

57:49.252 --> 57:54.722
You know, that hill is looking closer
tonight than it ever has before.

58:00.523 --> 58:03.443
Good night, Rocky.

58:05.313 --> 58:06.103
Good night,

58:06.813 --> 58:08.233
Ginger.

58:31.554 --> 58:35.264
Company, attention!

58:40.854 --> 58:44.734
Today's the day, girls.
We're going to fly. I can feel it.

58:46.524 --> 58:49.484
Finally, we get to see
a professional in action.

58:49.904 --> 58:52.234
Start warming up. I'll go get him.

58:52.824 --> 58:54.954
Rocky? Knock, knock.

58:55.364 --> 58:57.705
Everyone's waiting, so I told them...

01:00:49.108 --> 01:00:50.278
A cannon.

01:00:50.698 --> 01:00:54.239
That'd give you a thrust.
- I knew he was fake all along.

01:00:54.659 --> 01:00:58.079
In fact, I'm not even sure
if he was American.

01:01:00.079 --> 01:01:01.499
What's the next plan?

01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:07.419
Face it. The only way we get out
is wrapped in pastry.

01:01:08.629 --> 01:01:12.299
Perhaps he just went on holiday.
- Perhaps he left to get away

01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:15.009
from your infernal knitting!

01:01:17.759 --> 01:01:20.229
You always hit him.
See how you like it.

01:01:21.269 --> 01:01:23.140
Don't push me, four-eyes!

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:26.310
Quiet!

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.230
Quiet, I say! Dissention

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:33.450
in the ranks. Just what Jerry wants.
The old divide and conquer.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.820
A proper squadron work together,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.660
just like we did in my RAF days.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.210
Jocko at the stick, Flappy at the map,
and Whizzbang at the tail-end Charlie.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.630
Wingco would give the call, hop in
the old crate, chocks away!

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.250
That's how you get medals!

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.511
Will you shut up
about your stupid bloomin' medals!

01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:03.601
How dare you!

01:02:04.891 --> 01:02:07.811
Forgive me.
As an officer...

01:02:29.922 --> 01:02:32.842
Everyone, shut up!

01:02:43.772 --> 01:02:45.732
What exactly is the RAF?

01:02:46.602 --> 01:02:47.902
What do you mean?

01:02:48.312 --> 01:02:50.902
The Royal Air Force is what.

01:02:51.322 --> 01:02:54.363
Then what's the "old crate"?

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.203
There she is!

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:05.083
Gorgeous, isn't she? - You mean,
you flew? In one of these?

01:03:05.503 --> 01:03:09.173
Beautifully built. In fact,
there's a bit of a story there.

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:14.013
We were on a reconnaissance flight,
when the weather duffed up.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:17.343
Yes... of course.

01:03:17.803 --> 01:03:20.093
We may be able to pull this off.

01:03:20.513 --> 01:03:23.224
We're still flying out of here.

01:03:23.644 --> 01:03:27.644
Fowler's provided the answer.
- I have?

01:03:28.064 --> 01:03:30.104
Oh, yes. Of course I have.

01:03:31.484 --> 01:03:32.524
How have I?

01:03:32.944 --> 01:03:35.694
We'll make a crate.

01:03:36.864 --> 01:03:37.904
Mac,

01:03:38.324 --> 01:03:39.994
you'll handle engineering.

01:03:40.414 --> 01:03:41.824
Babs, manufacturing.

01:03:42.244 --> 01:03:44.454
Fowler is
chief aviation adviser.

01:03:44.874 --> 01:03:46.204
Bunty, eggs.

01:03:46.624 --> 01:03:47.874
Eggs?

01:03:48.294 --> 01:03:50.885
Right. Like the ones
the rooster was going to lay.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:54.055
Only roosters don't lay eggs, do they?

01:03:54.465 --> 01:03:58.725
Don't they? - It's a lady thing,
apparently. Ask your mum.

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:01.265
One egg per item on the list.

01:04:01.685 --> 01:04:05.395
First payment in advance.
- Right. When do we start?

01:04:18.155 --> 01:04:19.785
What the dickens?

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:24.586
Oh, gnomes now!

01:05:16.637 --> 01:05:20.768
Eggs from heaven!
- No, from her bum.

01:05:52.719 --> 01:05:53.879
Idiot!

01:05:54.759 --> 01:05:57.179
That was close. Too close.

01:05:58.299 --> 01:06:02.479
We can't stop now.
Everyone, go for it.

01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:03.809
Go, go!

01:06:07.019 --> 01:06:09.149
Mac! We need the calculations quick.

01:06:09.569 --> 01:06:11.819
Agnes, that has to be really secure.

01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:14.529
Careful up there, Fowler!

01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:18.870
Bunty, give him a hand.
Well done, Babs. Keep it up!

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.620
No problem, dollface.

01:07:06.501 --> 01:07:07.751
Ah, boy.

01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:15.761
Come on.

01:07:18.132 --> 01:07:19.262
Please!

01:07:24.102 --> 01:07:25.272
Oh, no.

01:07:25.682 --> 01:07:26.852
He's fixed it.

01:07:33.022 --> 01:07:35.032
Get the chickens.

01:07:35.732 --> 01:07:36.782
Which ones?

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:39.492
All of them!

01:07:46.793 --> 01:07:47.833
My tools!

01:07:50.423 --> 01:07:52.043
Thieving little buggers.

01:07:52.843 --> 01:07:54.553
What's the plan?

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.013
Attack!

01:08:01.763 --> 01:08:03.053
Nice plan.

01:08:12.943 --> 01:08:14.903
The chickens are revolting!

01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:17.993
Finally, something we agree on.

01:08:18.404 --> 01:08:19.453
Help!

01:08:25.163 --> 01:08:26.874
Under the hut!

01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:37.174
What have we done?
- This is it.

01:08:37.594 --> 01:08:39.094
We're escaping!

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:40.554
What? Now?

01:08:41.094 --> 01:08:41.974
Now!

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:44.724
But she's not ready.
- Listen!

01:08:45.145 --> 01:08:48.314
We either die free chickens
or die trying.

01:08:51.104 --> 01:08:53.774
Are those the only choices?
- Let's do it!

01:08:54.194 --> 01:08:55.365
Scramble!

01:09:48.247 --> 01:09:51.506
The exits are located here and here.

01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:55.797
In the likely event of an emergency,
put your head between your knees...

01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:58.387
...and kiss your bum goodbye.

01:09:58.797 --> 01:10:00.637
Okay, Fowler. Ready for takeoff.

01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:03.477
Behind you all the way.

01:10:05.977 --> 01:10:09.107
You're supposed to be up there.
You're the pilot!

01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:13.067
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't fly this contraption.

01:10:13.487 --> 01:10:16.238
But back in your day...
the Royal Air Force.

01:10:16.658 --> 01:10:21.158
644 Squadron, poultry division.
We were the mascots.

01:10:21.578 --> 01:10:23.828
You mean you never flew the plane?

01:10:24.248 --> 01:10:27.328
Good heavens, no. I'm a chicken.

01:10:29.378 --> 01:10:33.918
The Royal Air Force doesn't let
chickens fly a complex aircraft!

01:10:34.338 --> 01:10:37.628
We're all gonna die.
- Fowler, you have to fly it.

01:10:38.048 --> 01:10:40.218
You always talk about
"back in your day."

01:10:40.638 --> 01:10:42.678
Well, today is your day.

01:10:44.389 --> 01:10:47.389
You can do it, you old sausage.

01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:53.399
Wing Commander T.I. Fowler,
reporting for duty.

01:10:57.029 --> 01:11:01.529
What're you waiting for?
Let's get this crate off the ground!

01:11:02.869 --> 01:11:04.329
Fowler, now!

01:11:04.749 --> 01:11:06.749
Roger! Contact!

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.640
Cleared for takeoff!

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:29.270
Chocks away!

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.450
Full throttle!

01:12:04.601 --> 01:12:06.311
We need more power!

01:12:06.721 --> 01:12:08.181
I can't work miracles.

01:12:08.601 --> 01:12:10.731
We're givin' her all she's got!

01:12:19.742 --> 01:12:20.702
Gotcha!

01:12:21.112 --> 01:12:22.452
Hard right!

01:12:24.872 --> 01:12:26.492
Oh, mother.

01:12:32.292 --> 01:12:34.462
Turn her around.
I'll get the ramp.

01:12:48.143 --> 01:12:50.683
Put the ramp down!

01:12:53.853 --> 01:12:56.443
You are going to be a pie.

01:13:30.024 --> 01:13:32.024
Look out!

01:13:32.434 --> 01:13:33.694
Clear the runway!

01:13:55.295 --> 01:13:56.425
Let's go!

01:14:00.505 --> 01:14:02.765
We're flying!

01:14:16.736 --> 01:14:17.946
That's for leaving.

01:14:19.866 --> 01:14:22.236
And this is for coming back.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:29.416
Great Scott! What was that?

01:14:29.826 --> 01:14:31.166
A cling-on!

01:14:31.586 --> 01:14:34.006
The engines can't take it!

01:14:37.676 --> 01:14:39.087
My goodness!

01:14:39.507 --> 01:14:40.967
Babs! Scissors!

01:14:45.177 --> 01:14:48.057
Lower me down.
- But... - Just do it.

01:14:48.477 --> 01:14:50.147
Increase velocity!

01:14:50.557 --> 01:14:54.317
What's that mean?
- Pedal your flippin' giblets out!

01:15:07.457 --> 01:15:09.578
Lower!
- I'm trying!

01:15:17.088 --> 01:15:18.548
Look out!

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:40.529
Fire! Fire!

01:15:43.029 --> 01:15:44.239
My eggs!

01:15:54.839 --> 01:15:56.089
More ammo! Hurry!

01:15:56.499 --> 01:15:58.419
We got no more eggs!

01:15:58.839 --> 01:16:00.089
Look out!

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:09.730
No!

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.950
Bombs away!

01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:30.830
Mr. Tweedy!

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:34.880
That was good! That was good!

01:16:37.171 --> 01:16:39.711
The old bird bought it!

01:17:15.582 --> 01:17:19.342
I told you they was organized.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:32.432
We did it, everyone!

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:58.423
Keep pedaling. We're not there yet.

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:05.764
You can't see paradise
if you don't pedal.

01:18:08.304 --> 01:18:10.394
Put your drumsticks into it.

01:18:14.604 --> 01:18:19.984
That's what I told them. We were
losing altitude, heading for...

01:18:20.824 --> 01:18:24.944
A lovely holiday.
I'll be sad to go back.

01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:27.914
Safety at all times is imperative.

01:18:28.324 --> 01:18:31.744
Wind her up and let her go.

01:18:32.334 --> 01:18:33.374
So...

01:18:34.334 --> 01:18:36.965
Is it as good as you imagined?
- No.

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:40.755
It's better.

01:18:42.555 --> 01:18:44.595
I'll show you how to play cricket.

01:18:49.645 --> 01:18:51.395
Here's a thought.

01:18:51.765 --> 01:18:54.565
Let's get an egg
and start our own chicken farm.

01:18:54.975 --> 01:18:58.395
We'll have all the eggs we can eat.
- Right.

01:18:58.815 --> 01:19:02.155
We'll need a chicken then.
- No, an egg first.

01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:05.036
That's where the chicken comes from.

01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:08.366
No. Without the chicken
where do you get the egg?

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:11.326
From a chicken...
that comes from the egg.

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:13.586
But you need an egg to have a chicken.

01:19:13.996 --> 01:19:17.716
You got to get the chicken first
to get the egg.

01:19:18.126 --> 01:19:19.876
Then you get the chicken.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.546
Hang on. Let's go over this again.

01:22:59.553 --> 01:23:00.803
The egg, obviously.

01:23:01.213 --> 01:23:05.133
Rolling along happily, then crack!
It hatches the first chicken.

01:23:05.553 --> 01:23:07.644
But where'd the egg come from?

01:23:08.264 --> 01:23:13.524
What do you mean? - Egg comes rolling
along happily and wonders,

01:23:14.104 --> 01:23:19.324
where'd it come from without
a chicken? No eggs come rolling along.

01:23:19.944 --> 01:23:25.154
Without an egg to hatch the chicken
there'll be no chicken

01:23:25.784 --> 01:23:30.994
to lay the first egg. - Have we got
2 eggs now? - No, still the first egg.

01:23:31.624 --> 01:23:34.754
What about the first chicken?
- It's in the very first egg.

01:23:35.164 --> 01:23:36.834
Guys!

01:23:38.135 --> 01:23:40.295
I'm trying to enjoy paradise.

01:23:40.675 --> 01:23:44.015
Sorry, guv.
- Won't happen again.

01:23:44.425 --> 01:23:45.515
Thanks.

01:23:46.265 --> 01:23:47.975
Gitface.
- Pillock.

01:23:48.595 --> 01:23:52.015
Thinks he's such a big shot
'cause he's got his name on a poster.

01:23:52.015 --> 01:23:54.559
These show biz folk
are all the same.

01:23:54.559 --> 01:23:57.562
- Yeah, the rats
are the stars, actually.
- Yeah, of course they are.

01:23:57.562 --> 01:24:00.565
- We do all the work,
he gets all the credit.
- But he does get all the birds.

01:24:00.565 --> 01:24:02.692
- He gets everything.
- Yes, he does. Everything.

01:24:02.692 --> 01:24:06.654
- You said it, mate.
- I know.
