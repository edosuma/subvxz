01:10.445 --> 01:12.280
Hey, where you going?

01:13.531 --> 01:16.868
The morning bell ain't rung yet.
Go back to sleep.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.245
I wanna beat
the other fellows to the street.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.831
I don't want anyone should see.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.792
I...

01:24.501 --> 01:26.836
I ain't been walkin' so good.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.296
Quit gripin'.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.342
You know how many fellows
fake a limp for sympathy, right?

01:32.425 --> 01:34.678
That bum leg of yours is a gold mine.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.846
Someone gets the idea
I can't make it on my own,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.307
they'll lock me up in the Refuge
for good.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.685
Hey, be a pal, Jack. Help me down.

01:41.726 --> 01:42.894
Whoa!

01:43.728 --> 01:45.522
Do you wanna bust your other leg, too?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.440
No, I wanna go down.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.442
You'll be down there soon enough!

01:49.526 --> 01:50.694
Take a moment.

01:51.403 --> 01:54.155
Drink in my... My penthouse.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.700
High above the stinkin' streets
in New York.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.909
You're crazy.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.078
What, 'cause I like a breath of fresh air?

02:00.203 --> 02:02.664
'Cause I like seeing
the sky and the stars?

02:02.706 --> 02:04.416
Yeah, you're seeing stars, all right.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.794
Them streets down there...

02:08.336 --> 02:10.547
They sucked the life
right outta my old man.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.760
Years of rotten jobs,
stomped on by bosses.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.388
And when they finally broke him,
they... They tossed him to the curb

02:18.430 --> 02:19.931
just like yesterday's paper.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.599
Well, they ain't doin' that to me!

02:21.683 --> 02:24.310
But... But everyone wants to come here.

02:24.394 --> 02:28.732
New York's fine for those
who got a big strong door to lock it out.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.651
Yeah, but I tell you, Crutchie,

02:32.110 --> 02:34.279
there is a whole other way out there.

02:35.363 --> 02:39.242
So, you keep your small life
in a big city.

02:39.284 --> 02:43.913
Give me a big life in a small town.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.835
<i>They say folks is dyin' to get here</i>

02:48.918 --> 02:51.713
<i>Me, I'm dyin' to get away</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:57.260
<i>To a little town out west
that's spankin' new</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:01.931
<i>And while I ain't never been there</i>

03:02.349 --> 03:05.060
<i>I can see it clear as day</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:07.604
<i>If you want</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:09.773
<i>I bet you you could see it, too</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:14.778
<i>Close your eyes</i>

03:14.819 --> 03:16.488
<i>Come with me</i>

03:16.571 --> 03:19.616
<i>Where it's clean and green and pretty</i>

03:19.699 --> 03:23.787
<i>And they went
and made a city outta clay</i>

03:25.121 --> 03:27.374
<i>Like the minute that you get there</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:30.210
<i>Folks will walk right up and say</i>

03:30.669 --> 03:32.671
<i>"Welcome home, son</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:37.133
<i>"Welcome home to Santa Fe!"</i>

03:37.717 --> 03:40.887
<i>Plantin' crops, splittin' rails</i>

03:40.970 --> 03:43.515
<i>Swappin' tales around the fire</i>

03:43.598 --> 03:49.521
<i>Oh, 'cept for Sunday
when you lie around all day</i>

03:49.604 --> 03:52.524
<i>Soon your friends are more like family</i>

03:52.607 --> 03:56.528
<i>And they's beggin' you to stay</i>

03:56.611 --> 03:59.406
<i>Ain't that neat?</i>

03:59.489 --> 04:00.615
<i>Livin' sweet</i>

04:01.783 --> 04:05.662
<i>In Santa Fe</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:07.747
You got folks there?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.166
Ain't got no folks nowhere.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.584
What, you?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.336
I don't need folks.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.880
I got friends.

04:17.464 --> 04:19.091
Hey. Hey!

04:19.175 --> 04:21.177
How's about you come with me?

04:21.261 --> 04:24.180
No one cares
about no bum leg in Santa Fe.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.683
No, you just... Just hop a palomino!

04:26.725 --> 04:28.101
You ride it in style.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.021
Yeah! Feature me, ridin' in style.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.648
Hey! I bet a few months of clean air,

04:33.690 --> 04:36.359
and you, you could toss
that crutch for good!

04:36.443 --> 04:39.112
<i>Santa Fe</i>

04:39.195 --> 04:41.072
<i>You can bet</i>

04:41.156 --> 04:44.242
<i>We won't let them bastards beat us</i>

04:44.325 --> 04:45.660
<i>We won't beg no one</i>

04:45.702 --> 04:49.831
<i>To treat us fair and square</i>

04:49.873 --> 04:53.084
<i>There's a life that's worth the livin'</i>

04:53.168 --> 04:56.463
<i>And I'm gonna do my share</i>

04:56.546 --> 04:58.506
<i>Work the land</i>

04:58.631 --> 05:00.425
<i>Chase the sun</i>

05:00.508 --> 05:04.554
<i>Swim the whole Rio Grande just for fun</i>

05:04.637 --> 05:08.099
<i>Watch me stand!</i>

05:08.183 --> 05:10.185
<i>Watch me run...</i>

05:12.604 --> 05:13.730
Hey.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.441
Hey.

05:17.609 --> 05:21.112
<i>Don't you know that we's a family?</i>

05:21.196 --> 05:23.073
<i>Hey, would I let ya down? Huh?</i>

05:23.114 --> 05:24.657
<i>No way</i>

05:26.076 --> 05:28.661
<i>Just hold on, kid</i>

05:28.745 --> 05:34.751
<i>'Til that train makes Santa Fe</i>

05:38.546 --> 05:40.090
Time for dreamin's done.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.424
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.093
Hey, Specs!

05:43.176 --> 05:44.761
Racer, Henry, Albert, Elmer!

05:44.803 --> 05:48.139
Get a move on!
Them papes don't sell themselves!

05:58.566 --> 06:02.112
Hey, Albert, Elmer, Specs,
you heard Jack.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.321
Get a move on.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.615
I was having the most beautiful dream.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.617
My lips are still tinglin'.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.993
A pretty girl?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.787
A leg of lamb.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.374
<i>Hey, that's my cigar</i>

06:14.457 --> 06:16.001
<i>You'll steal another</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:18.753
<i>Hey, look, it's bath time at the zoo</i>

06:19.421 --> 06:22.382
<i>I thought that I'd surprise my mother</i>

06:22.465 --> 06:24.342
If you can find her.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.719
Who asked you?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.138
Papes ain't movin' like they used to.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.765
I think I need a new sellin' spot.
Got any ideas?

06:30.807 --> 06:34.102
<i>From Bottle Alley to the harbor</i>

06:34.144 --> 06:36.855
<i>There's easy pickin's guaranteed</i>

06:37.063 --> 06:40.442
<i>Try any banker, bum, or barber</i>

06:40.483 --> 06:43.903
<i>They almost all knows how to read</i>

06:43.987 --> 06:47.157
<i>It's a crooked game we're playin'</i>

06:47.198 --> 06:50.326
<i>One we'll never lose</i>

06:50.368 --> 06:53.580
<i>Long as suckers don't mind payin'</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:57.792
<i>Just to get bad news</i>

06:57.834 --> 06:59.961
<i>Ain't it a fine life</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:03.673
<i>Carryin' the banner through it all</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:06.468
<i>A mighty fine life</i>

07:06.509 --> 07:10.972
<i>Carryin' the banner tough and tall</i>

07:11.014 --> 07:12.891
<i>When that bell rings</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:16.061
<i>We goes where we wishes
We's as free as fishes</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:17.520
<i>Sure beats washing dishes</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:19.522
<i>What a fine life</i>

07:19.564 --> 07:22.942
<i>Carryin' the banner home free all</i>

07:23.026 --> 07:25.028
Well, hello, hello, hello, beautiful.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.947
Step aside, Romeo.
Nothin' more concerns you here.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.115
Mornin', miss.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.493
May I interest you in the latest news?

07:31.534 --> 07:32.702
The paper isn't out yet.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.915
I would be delighted
to deliver it to you personally.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.334
I've got a headline for you.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.504
"Cheeky Boy Gets Nothing
For His Troubles."

07:43.672 --> 07:44.798
Back to the bench, slugger.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.549
-You struck out.
-I'm crushed!

07:46.633 --> 07:47.676
Hey, Crutchie.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.928
What's your leg say? Gonna rain?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.888
No rain.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.766
Partly cloudy, clear by evenin'.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.142
They ought to bottle this guy!

07:56.226 --> 08:00.188
Yeah, and the limp sells
50 papes a week all by itself.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.525
I don't need the limp to sell papes.
I got personality.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.778
<i>It takes a smile that spreads like butter</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:09.030
<i>The kind that turns a lady's head</i>

08:09.948 --> 08:13.159
<i>It takes an orphan with a stutter</i>

08:13.243 --> 08:14.911
<i>-Who's also blind
-And mute</i>

08:14.994 --> 08:16.204
<i>And dead</i>

08:16.913 --> 08:20.041
<i>Summer stinks and winter's freezing</i>

08:20.083 --> 08:23.169
<i>When you works outdoors</i>

08:23.336 --> 08:26.631
<i>Start out sweatin', end up sneezin'</i>

08:26.715 --> 08:31.177
<i>In between, it pours</i>

08:31.261 --> 08:32.929
<i>Still, it's a fine life</i>

08:33.013 --> 08:34.847
<i>Carryin' the banner with me chums</i>

08:34.931 --> 08:37.808
<i>Still, it's a fine life
Carryin' the banner with me chums</i>

08:37.892 --> 08:41.187
<i>A bunch of big shots
Tossin' out a freebie to the bums</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:43.732
<i>A bunch of big shots
Tossin' out a freebie</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:45.859
<i>Hey, what's the holdup?</i>

08:45.942 --> 08:49.029
<i>Waitin' makes me antsy
I likes living chancy</i>

08:49.112 --> 08:52.157

09:10.592 --> 09:13.636
<i>Loves you</i>

09:13.678 --> 09:15.972
<i>You shall</i>

09:16.056 --> 09:18.224
<i>Be saved</i>

09:18.308 --> 09:19.684
Thanks for the grub, Sister.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.021
Elmer, when are we going to see you
inside the church?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.315
I don't know, Sister.
But it's bound to rain sooner or later.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.817
<i>Curdled</i>

09:27.859 --> 09:29.736
<i>Just give me half a cup</i>

09:29.819 --> 09:30.987

09:39.371 --> 09:40.914
<i>Papers is all I got</i>

09:40.997 --> 09:42.499
<i>It's 88 degrees</i>

09:42.582 --> 09:44.042
<i>Jack says to change my spot</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:45.502
<i>Wish I could catch a breeze</i>

09:45.543 --> 09:47.128
<i>-Just two
-Maybe it's worth a shot</i>

09:47.170 --> 09:48.505
<i>All I can catch is fleas</i>

09:48.546 --> 09:51.424
<i>If I hate the headline
I'll make up a headline</i>

09:51.508 --> 09:54.302
<i>And I'll say anything I have to...</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:10.920
<i>Always out there

11:11.129 --> 11:12.756
Hey, look!
They're puttin' up the headline.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.967
I hope it's real bloody
with a nice, clear picture!

11:16.051 --> 11:17.218
Yeah!

11:29.481 --> 11:31.775
The trolley strike? Not again!

11:31.858 --> 11:34.027
Man, three weeks of the same story.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.445
They're killin' us with that snoozer.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.572
Hey, make way! Hey, step aside!

11:37.614 --> 11:41.659
Dear me!
What is that unpleasant aroma?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.788
I fear the sewers may have
backed up during the night.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.623
Or could it be...

11:46.706 --> 11:48.500
The Delancey brothers!

11:48.583 --> 11:49.834
Hey, Oscar,

11:49.918 --> 11:52.462
word on the street says
you and your brother took money

11:52.504 --> 11:53.838
to beat up striking trolley workers.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.799
So? It's honest work.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.551
By crackin' the heads
of defenseless workers?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.637
I take care of the guy
who takes care of me.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.931
Hey, ain't your father
one of the strikers?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.184
-Guess he didn't take care of me!
-Hey!

12:06.267 --> 12:08.436
You want some of that, too?
Ya lousy crip!

12:08.478 --> 12:10.522
-Hey!
-That is not nice, Morris.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.482
All right, five to one Jack skunks him!

12:12.524 --> 12:13.983
-Yeah!
-Get off me.

12:14.025 --> 12:17.404
One unfortunate day, you might find
you got a bum gam of your own.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.823
How'd you like us pickin' on you, huh?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.908
Hey! Hey! Maybe we should find out.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.871
Wait 'til I get my hands on you.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.164
You gotta catch me first!

12:30.250 --> 12:31.418
Go, Jack!

12:31.501 --> 12:33.169
<i>We'll all be out there</i>

12:33.253 --> 12:36.631
<i>Carryin' the banner man to man</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:39.551
<i>We're always out there</i>

12:39.634 --> 12:42.846
<i>Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can</i>

12:44.264 --> 12:45.849
<i>Here's the headline</i>

12:45.974 --> 12:47.392
<i>"Newsies on a Mission!"</i>

12:47.475 --> 12:49.019
<i>Kill the competition!</i>

12:49.102 --> 12:50.395
<i>Sell the next edition!</i>

12:50.478 --> 12:53.690
<i>We'll be out there
carryin' the banner!</i>

12:53.815 --> 12:57.027
<i>See us out there
carryin' the banner!</i>

12:57.110 --> 13:00.447
<i>Always out there
carryin' the banner!</i>

13:05.285 --> 13:06.369
<i>Go!</i>

13:24.888 --> 13:27.390
Papes for the newsies! Line up!

13:27.432 --> 13:29.601
Morning, Weasel! You missed me?

13:29.684 --> 13:31.394
The name's Wiesel.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.397
Ain't that what I said?
I'll take the usual.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.107
Hundred papes for the wise guy.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.276
How's it goin', Weasel?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.903
At least call me Mister.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.948
Well, I'll call you sweetheart
if you'd spot me 50 papes, huh?

13:44.032 --> 13:46.284
Drop the cash and move it along.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.120
Well, whatever happened to romance?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.830
Fifty for the Racer. Next!

13:51.039 --> 13:52.415
Good morning, Mr. Wiesel.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.751
Fifty papes for Crutchie.

13:54.793 --> 13:58.254
Have a look at this. A new kid!

13:58.296 --> 13:59.381
I'm new, too!

13:59.422 --> 14:00.590
Hey, don't worry, kid.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.134
-It rubs right off.
-Yeah.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.511
I'll take 20 newspapers please.

14:04.594 --> 14:05.929
Twenty for the new kid.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.098
And let's see the dime.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.599
I'll pay when I sell them.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.519
Funny, kid, Come on. Cash up front.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.938
But whatever I don't sell,
you buy back, right?

14:15.563 --> 14:17.982
Certainly! And every time
you lose a tooth,

14:18.066 --> 14:19.734
I put a penny under your pillow.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.904
Come on! Drop the cash or move along.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.823
Move it along.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.616
Albert, let me see your money!

14:26.700 --> 14:29.369
You have a very interesting face.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.788
Ever think about
getting into moving pictures?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.289
-You really think I could?
-Sure.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.250
Buy a ticket. They'll let anyone in.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.253
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.214
I paid for 20, but you gave me 19.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.425
You seen how nice
I was to the new kid?

14:43.466 --> 14:45.135
-And what do I get for my civility?
-Hey.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.971
-Ungrounded accusations.
-I just want what I paid for.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.097
He said beat it!

14:49.139 --> 14:50.181
Whoa!

14:50.265 --> 14:52.475
New kid's right, Wiesel.
You gave him 19.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.561
Hey, I'm sure it's an honest mistake

14:54.644 --> 14:56.730
on account of Oscar
can't count to 20 with his shoes on.

14:57.981 --> 14:58.982
Here!

14:59.024 --> 15:00.483
-Now take a hike!
-Hey!

15:00.525 --> 15:02.152
Give the new kid 50 more papes.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.278
I don't want more papes.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.031
What kind of newsie
don't want more papes?

15:06.114 --> 15:07.490
Yeah. Crazy.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.869
I'm no charity case.
I don't even know you.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.120
His name's Jack.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.748
Yeah, this here
is the famous Jack Kelly.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.000
He once escaped jail on the back
of Teddy Roosevelt's carriage.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.084
Made all the papes.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.838
-How old are you, kid?
-I'm 10, almost.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.674
Well, if anybody asks, you're seven.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.760
Younger sells more papes,
and if we're gonna be partners...

15:26.843 --> 15:28.511
Who said we want a partner?

15:28.595 --> 15:31.431
Selling with Jack
is the chance of a lifetime.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.183
You learn from him,
you learn from the best.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.726
If he's the best,
what's he need with me?

15:34.809 --> 15:37.020
'Cause you got a little brother
and I don't.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.356
With that puss, we could easy
sell 1,000 papes a week.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.774
Hey, look sad, kid.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.818
We're gonna make millions!

15:44.069 --> 15:46.279
This is my brother David. I'm Les.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.489
Hey, nice to meet you, Davey.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.115
My two bits come off the top,

15:49.199 --> 15:50.825
we split everything else 70-30, all right?

15:50.867 --> 15:55.080
Fifty-fifty. You wouldn't try
to pull a fast one on a little kid?

15:57.207 --> 16:00.794
Sixty-forty. And that is my final offer.

16:03.755 --> 16:04.756
Deal!

16:07.384 --> 16:09.010
That's disgusting.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.470
That's just business.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.514
Newsies, hit the streets!

16:12.555 --> 16:15.225
The sun is up, the headline stinks,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.268
and this kid ain't getting any younger!

16:18.228 --> 16:20.188
<i>We'll all be out there</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:23.108
<i>Carryin' the banner man to man</i>

16:24.818 --> 16:26.778
<i>We're always out there</i>

16:26.861 --> 16:30.073
<i>Soakin' ev'ry sucker that we can</i>

16:31.241 --> 16:33.243
<i>Here's the headline</i>

16:33.284 --> 16:34.828
<i>"Newsies on a Mission!"</i>

16:34.911 --> 16:36.246
<i>Kill the competition!</i>

16:36.329 --> 16:37.789
<i>Sell the next edition!</i>

16:37.872 --> 16:39.666
<i>We'll be out there</i>

16:39.749 --> 16:41.418
<i>Carryin' the banner!</i>

16:41.459 --> 16:42.919
<i>See us out there</i>

16:43.003 --> 16:44.254
<i>Carryin' the banner!</i>

16:44.295 --> 16:45.964
<i>Always out there</i>

16:46.047 --> 16:47.924
<i>Carryin' the banner!</i>

16:52.804 --> 16:54.014
<i>Go!</i>

17:03.940 --> 17:05.900
Gentlemen, <i>The World</i> is in trouble.

17:05.942 --> 17:09.445
Our circulation is down
for the third quarter in a row.

17:09.487 --> 17:12.406
But, Mr. Pulitzer, every paper's
circulation is down since the war ended.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.785
Whoever said "War is hell"
wasn't trying to sell newspapers.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.164
-We could use an exciting headline.
-What have we got today?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.790
The trolley strike.

17:22.666 --> 17:23.960
That's not exciting?

17:24.336 --> 17:25.962
-It's epic.
-It's boring.

17:26.003 --> 17:29.007
Folks wanna know,
"Is the trolley comin' or am I walkin'?"

17:29.090 --> 17:30.550
No one cares why.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.430
And the strike's about to be settled.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.891
Governor Roosevelt just put
his support behind the workers.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.768
That man is a socialist.

17:40.977 --> 17:44.356
Teddy Roosevelt is no socialist.
He's an American hero.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.359
The man wants to outlaw football
for being too violent!

17:48.610 --> 17:51.488
Football! Violent?

17:53.823 --> 17:57.494
You're right. He's no socialist.
He's a commie.

17:57.952 --> 18:01.289
Mr. Pulitzer, you must try to sit still.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.041
Gentlemen, please.
You're making Nunzio nervous.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
And when Nunzio gets nervous,

18:06.294 --> 18:07.712
I don't look pretty.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.173
You never liked Roosevelt.

18:10.465 --> 18:14.928
You wrote an editorial against him
day after day when he ran for governor.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.680
And guess what, he got elected.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.350
How can I influence voters
if they're not reading my opinion?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.895
-Big photos attract readers.
-Do you know what big photos cost?

18:24.187 --> 18:26.439
But without flashy photos
and headlines,

18:26.523 --> 18:28.525
how are we supposed
to sell more papers?

18:29.192 --> 18:31.903
The answer is right before your eyes.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.614
You're not thinking this through.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.366
People...

18:36.408 --> 18:39.202
<i>Nunzio knows
when he's cutting my hair</i>

18:39.994 --> 18:43.164
<i>Trim a bit here
and then trim a bit there</i>

18:43.206 --> 18:47.085
<i>Just a modest adjustment
can fatten the bottom line...</i>

18:47.419 --> 18:49.754
Mr. Pulitzer, please.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.717
<i>Shaving is tricky, the razor should float</i>

18:53.758 --> 18:57.137
<i>Shave me too close
and you may cut my throat</i>

18:57.220 --> 19:01.725
<i>It's the simplest solutions
that bolster the bottom line</i>

19:02.350 --> 19:04.185
How does that help us
sell more papers?

19:04.436 --> 19:07.856
We don't sell papers, silly.
Newsies sell papers.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.733
Exactly, silly.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.445
-Newsies sell papers.
-I've got it.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.113
Right now, we charge the newsies

19:15.196 --> 19:17.407
-50 cents for 100 papers.
-Yes.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.410
But if we raise their price
to 60 cents per 100...

19:20.535 --> 19:21.786
Now you're getting somewhere.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.830
A mere tenth of a penny per paper?

19:23.913 --> 19:27.042
Every single newsie
would have to sell 10 more papers

19:27.083 --> 19:29.586
just to earn the same amount as always.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.630
My thought exactly. It's genius.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.383
But it's going to be awfully rough
on those children.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.845
Nonsense. I'm giving them
a real life lesson in economics.

19:39.012 --> 19:42.223
I couldn't offer them a better education
if they were my own.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.101
<i>Give me a week and I'll train 'em to be</i>

19:45.310 --> 19:48.396
<i>Like an army that's marching to war</i>

19:49.064 --> 19:52.484
<i>Proud of themselves
and so grateful to me</i>

19:52.567 --> 19:55.445
<i>They'll be begging to pay even more</i>

19:55.528 --> 19:57.364
<i>When there's dirt on your shoes, boys</i>

19:57.447 --> 19:58.698
<i>For God's sake, relax</i>

19:59.282 --> 20:02.285
<i>Why throw them out?
All we need is some wax</i>

20:02.369 --> 20:05.205
<i>Listen well
to these barbershop lessons</i>

20:05.288 --> 20:08.208
<i>For they'll see you through</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:12.545
<i>When you're stuck in the muck
you'll be fine</i>

20:12.629 --> 20:15.507
<i>You'll erase any trace of decline</i>

20:15.757 --> 20:17.634
<i>-With a trim!
-And a snip!</i>

20:17.676 --> 20:21.429
<i>-And a shine
-And the power of the press, yes</i>

20:21.471 --> 20:24.474
<i>Once again is mine!</i>

20:25.183 --> 20:28.603
<i>The price for the newsies
goes up in the morning</i>

20:28.645 --> 20:31.564
<i>Just a few common cents, gents</i>

20:31.648 --> 20:33.817
<i>That's the bottom line...</i>

20:33.900 --> 20:36.903
<i>Every new outcome is income for you</i>

20:36.986 --> 20:39.698
<i>Thanks to that bottom line!</i>

20:40.490 --> 20:42.367
Extra! Extra...

20:44.494 --> 20:46.663
<i>Sunup to sundown</i>

20:46.705 --> 20:49.332
<i>Knowin' where my customers will be</i>

20:50.959 --> 20:52.836
<i>Sunup to sundown</i>

20:52.919 --> 20:56.006
<i>Watchin' all the ladies watchin' me</i>

20:57.841 --> 21:01.011
<i>Walk my shoes off
got the dough to show it</i>

21:01.094 --> 21:04.055
<i>Probably I'll blow it
Then before you know it</i>

21:04.139 --> 21:07.600
<i>We'll be out there carryin' the banner</i>

21:07.684 --> 21:10.812
Paper! Paper! Evenin' pape here.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.524
Sing him to sleep, why don't you?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.568
Extra! Extra!

21:16.651 --> 21:18.903
"Terrified flight from burnin' inferno."

21:18.987 --> 21:21.114
You heard the story right here.

21:21.531 --> 21:22.699
Thanks, mister.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.119
You just made that up.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.997
I did not. I said he heard it right here.
And he did.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.915
Well, my father taught us not to lie.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.876
Yeah! Mine taught me not to starve.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.378
Hey! Just sold my last paper!

21:35.420 --> 21:37.630
-I got one more.
-Sell it or pay for it.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.049
Give it here!

21:40.258 --> 21:42.052
Go, go, go.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.388
Buy a pape from a poor orphan boy.

21:46.556 --> 21:50.268
You dear thing.
Of course, I'll take a newspaper.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.519
Here's a dime.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.691
Born to the breed.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.361
This is so much better than school!

21:59.402 --> 22:01.196
-This kid.
-Don't even think it.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.490
When Pop goes back to work,
we go back to school.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.241
Hey, so, how's about
we divvy up the money?

22:05.325 --> 22:06.868
We'll grab some chow and find you

22:06.910 --> 22:08.328
someplace safe to spend
the night. Yeah?

22:08.411 --> 22:10.663
No, we gotta get home.
Our folks'll be waitin' dinner.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.583
You got folks, huh?

22:14.376 --> 22:15.919
-Doesn't everyone?
-Hey.

22:19.464 --> 22:22.175
Our dad tangled
with a delivery truck on the job.

22:22.258 --> 22:25.136
Messed up his leg bad,
so they laid him off.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.888
That's how come we had to find work.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.891
Yeah, sure, that...
That makes sense, yes.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.226
Too... Too bad about your dad.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.936
Look, why don't you
come home with us for dinner?

22:32.977 --> 22:34.354
Our folks will be happy to have you.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.398
-Mom's a great cook.
-Yeah.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.732
Thanks for the invite.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.735
I just remembered
I got plans with a fella.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.530
He's probably waitin' on me
right now. I...

22:43.613 --> 22:46.616
-Is that the guy you're meetin'?
-What?

22:46.950 --> 22:48.535
-Kelly!
-Run for it!

22:48.618 --> 22:49.953
-Kelly!
-Come on, run!

22:52.080 --> 22:53.832
This way, Officer!

22:56.459 --> 22:57.752
Jack Kelly!

23:02.549 --> 23:04.342
Hurry! Come on, kid!

23:07.762 --> 23:09.472
Down here. Down here.

23:14.310 --> 23:15.854
Slow down. We lost him.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.689
Does someone wanna tell me
why I'm running?

23:17.772 --> 23:20.150
I got no one chasing me!

23:20.233 --> 23:21.818
Who was that guy?

23:22.485 --> 23:26.573
That, there, was Snyder the Spider.
A real sweetie.

23:27.157 --> 23:30.076
He runs a jail for underage kids
called the Refuge.

23:31.161 --> 23:34.664
The more kids he brings in,
the more city pays him.

23:34.748 --> 23:37.208
Problem is, all that money
goes right into his own pocket.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.920
Just do yourself a favor.
Stay clear of him and the Refuge.

23:41.004 --> 23:42.505
I hear you.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.132
Hey! You up there!

23:44.883 --> 23:47.177
No kids allowed in the theater!

23:47.260 --> 23:49.054
Not even me, Miss Medda?

23:49.137 --> 23:50.805
-Jack Kelly?
-Yeah.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.599
Man of mystery.

23:52.682 --> 23:55.185
Get yourself down here
and give me a hug.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.483
Where you been keepin' yourself, kid?

24:01.524 --> 24:04.444
Never far from you, Miss Medda.

24:04.986 --> 24:07.697
Boys! May I introduce
Miss Medda Larkin,

24:07.739 --> 24:10.367
the greatest star in the Bowery today.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.701
She also owns the joint.

24:11.785 --> 24:13.578
The only thing I own is the mortgage.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.206
-Pleasure, gents.
-A pleasure.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.125
What is wrong with you?

24:19.209 --> 24:21.336
Are you blind? She got no clothes on!

24:21.878 --> 24:24.297
-That's her costume!
-But I can see her legs!

24:24.381 --> 24:27.842
Well, step out of his way
so's he can get a better look.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.346
Theater's not only entertaining,
it's educational.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.139
Got the picture, kid?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.268
Say, Miss Medda,
we got a little situation on the street.

24:37.352 --> 24:38.561
You mind if I hide out here a while?

24:38.853 --> 24:42.232
Where better to escape trouble
than a theater?

24:42.273 --> 24:44.901
Is Snyder after you again?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.320
Hey, Jack, did you really escape jail

24:47.404 --> 24:50.073
on the back
of Teddy Roosevelt's carriage?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.492
Come on, what would the governor
be doing at a juvenile jail?

24:52.575 --> 24:54.869
It so happens he was running for office,

24:54.911 --> 24:57.914
and he wanted to show
he cared about orphans and such.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.792
So while he got his mug in a pape,
I got my butt in the backseat,

25:00.875 --> 25:02.544
and off we rode together.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.254
You really know the governor?

25:04.295 --> 25:07.090
He don't, but I do!

25:07.507 --> 25:10.093
Say, Jack, when you've got time,

25:10.176 --> 25:12.887
I want you to paint me
another one of these backdrops.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.598
-Sure.
-This last one you did is a doozy.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.100
-Yeah.
-Folks love it.

25:17.142 --> 25:20.520
And things have been going so well
that I can actually pay.

25:20.603 --> 25:22.981
I couldn't take your money,
Miss Medda.

25:23.064 --> 25:24.566
You pictured that?

25:24.607 --> 25:27.277
Your friend is quite an artist.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.029
All right. Take it easy.
It's a bunch of trees.

25:29.154 --> 25:30.780
You're really good.

25:30.864 --> 25:34.117
-That boy's got natural aptitude.
-Okay.

25:34.159 --> 25:37.037
Jeez! I never knew
no one with an aptitude.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.247
Miss Medda, you're on!

25:39.289 --> 25:41.541
I am? How am I doing?

25:45.170 --> 25:46.212
You're good.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.342
Boys, lock the door and stay all night.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.926
You're with Medda now.

25:53.762 --> 25:57.057
Ladies and gentlemen!

25:57.307 --> 26:00.185
Please welcome the star of our show,

26:00.268 --> 26:04.064
Miss Medda Larkin!

26:09.361 --> 26:13.281
<i>I'm doing all right for myself, folks</i>

26:13.323 --> 26:18.536
<i>I'm healthy, I'm wealthy
I'm wise</i>

26:18.620 --> 26:24.292
<i>My investments and such
have all gone up so much</i>

26:24.334 --> 26:28.421
<i>Seems whatever I touch</i>

26:28.505 --> 26:32.300
<i>Starts to rise</i>

26:33.134 --> 26:36.221
<i>I've been all kinds of lucky</i>

26:36.304 --> 26:38.056
<i>And yet</i>

26:39.015 --> 26:41.559
<i>The thing I want most</i>

26:41.643 --> 26:45.146
<i>I can't get...</i>

26:49.359 --> 26:51.945
Well, hello!

26:54.280 --> 26:56.616
Welcome to my theater.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.451
Now, listen.

26:58.535 --> 27:02.622
<i>I live in a mansion
on Long Island Sound</i>

27:02.706 --> 27:05.959
<i>I pulled up a weed
They found oil in the ground</i>

27:06.042 --> 27:10.755
<i>But you telling me
you don't want me around</i>

27:10.839 --> 27:12.882
<i>Now, honey, that's rich!</i>

27:14.050 --> 27:18.054
<i>Some guys give me ermine
chinchilla, and mink</i>

27:18.096 --> 27:21.558
<i>And some give me diamonds
as big as a sink</i>

27:21.766 --> 27:26.354
<i>But you wouldn't give me
so much as a wink</i>

27:26.396 --> 27:28.565
<i>Now, baby, that's rich!</i>

27:29.065 --> 27:33.403
<i>I get brandy from Andy
and candy from Scott</i>

27:33.486 --> 27:36.865
<i>And Frank and Eduardo
chipped in for a yacht</i>

27:36.906 --> 27:40.910
<i>I get stares from the fellas
and prayers from the Pope</i>

27:40.952 --> 27:45.081
<i>But I ran out my luck
getting stuck with some dope</i>

27:45.123 --> 27:48.460
Hey, honey,
I was just talking about you!

27:48.543 --> 27:52.088
<i>Now, listen, sport, this life's too short</i>

27:52.172 --> 27:54.924
<i>To waste it on you</i>

27:56.426 --> 28:00.096
<i>It may be rough, but soon enough</i>

28:00.180 --> 28:04.267
<i>I'll learn to make do with</i>

28:04.309 --> 28:07.771
<i>The mansion, the oil well
the diamonds, the yacht</i>

28:07.854 --> 28:11.191
<i>With Andy, Eduardo
the Pontiff and Scott</i>

28:12.192 --> 28:15.445
<i>And Frank, and my bank</i>

28:15.487 --> 28:18.823
<i>So spill no tears for me</i>

28:18.907 --> 28:21.284
<i>'Cause there's one thing you ain't</i>

28:21.326 --> 28:23.578
<i>That I'll always be</i>

28:23.620 --> 28:25.997
<i>And, honey, yeah, that's right</i>

28:26.081 --> 28:30.126
<i>That's rich!</i>

28:30.210 --> 28:33.630
<i>That's rich!</i>

28:34.130 --> 28:37.300
<i>That's</i>

28:38.468 --> 28:40.637
<i>Rich</i>

28:40.720 --> 28:42.389
<i>That's rich!</i>

28:47.769 --> 28:49.437
Thank you!

28:52.148 --> 28:53.775
Thank you!

28:54.984 --> 28:56.528
And now, gents...

28:57.821 --> 29:01.574
Let's have a big hand
for the Bowery Beauties!

29:11.376 --> 29:12.961
Why don't you go find out?

29:14.796 --> 29:18.299
<i>Don't come a-knocking on my door</i>

29:20.260 --> 29:21.344
Hello, again.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.638
This is a private box.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.724
What, you want I should lock the door?

29:27.017 --> 29:29.769
Twice in one day. Think it's fate?

29:29.853 --> 29:31.855
Go away. I'm working.

29:31.896 --> 29:34.357
A working girl, huh? Doing what?

29:34.816 --> 29:36.901
Reviewing the show
for <i>The New York Sun.</i>

29:36.985 --> 29:38.778
Hey! I work for <i>The World.</i>

29:38.862 --> 29:41.072
Somewhere out there someone cares.

29:41.156 --> 29:42.365
Go tell them.

29:43.324 --> 29:44.659
The view is better here.

29:44.701 --> 29:48.121
Please go. I am not in the habit
of speaking to strangers.

29:48.204 --> 29:50.540
Well, then you're gonna make
a lousy reporter.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.043
The name's Jack Kelly.

29:53.084 --> 29:55.086
Is that what it says on your rap sheet?

29:56.046 --> 29:57.714
A smart girl, huh?

29:58.381 --> 30:00.300
I admire smart girls.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.719
Beautiful. Smart. Independent...

30:02.761 --> 30:04.929
-Do you mind?
-Pipe down, up there!

30:05.889 --> 30:09.017
You got in for free.
At least pay attention.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.019
I'm sorry, Miss Medda.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.697
<i>I got no use for moonlight</i>

30:22.739 --> 30:25.700
<i>Or sappy poetry</i>

30:26.576 --> 30:29.913
<i>Love at first sight's for suckers</i>

30:29.996 --> 30:33.416
<i>At least it used to be</i>

30:33.458 --> 30:37.587
<i>Look, girls are nice once or twice</i>

30:37.629 --> 30:41.466
<i>Till I find someone new</i>

30:41.549 --> 30:44.427
<i>But I never planned</i>

30:44.469 --> 30:48.431
<i>On no one like you</i>

30:50.350 --> 30:52.018
<i>Don't come a-knocking on my door</i>

30:52.102 --> 30:53.937
<i>I got no use</i>

30:54.020 --> 30:57.607
<i>-You aren't welcome here no more
-For moonlight</i>

30:57.649 --> 30:59.776
<i>I should've known
you stunk like yesterday's trash</i>

30:59.859 --> 31:01.277
<i>Or sappy poetry</i>

31:01.820 --> 31:04.572
<i>The night you stole my heart
plus $40 in cash</i>

31:04.614 --> 31:07.283
<i>-Turns out my beau is just some bum
-Love at first sight's...</i>

31:07.325 --> 31:08.868
<i>Turns out that love ain't blind
it's dumb</i>

31:08.952 --> 31:12.205
<i>...for suckers
At least it used to be</i>

31:12.288 --> 31:14.290
<i>You got no education
and you dress like a thug</i>

31:14.374 --> 31:16.793
<i>You kiss like my Dalmatian
and you lie like a rug</i>

31:16.835 --> 31:18.211
-What are you doing?
-Hey! Hey!

31:18.294 --> 31:19.796
Quiet down. There's a show going on.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.923
You are the most impossible boy...

31:23.133 --> 31:24.134
Ever.

31:24.175 --> 31:27.137
<i>Don't come a-knocking on my door!</i>

31:27.220 --> 31:31.349
<i>-No, I never planned on no one
-Don't come a-knocking on my door!</i>

31:32.225 --> 31:33.977
<i>Like you</i>

32:11.639 --> 32:15.560
Man, them fire sirens
kept me awake all night.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.354
Sirens is like lullabies to me.

32:17.437 --> 32:19.147
The louder they wail,
the better the headline.

32:19.189 --> 32:21.649
The better the headline, the better I eat.
And the better I eat...

32:21.691 --> 32:24.069
The further away from you I sleep.

32:24.861 --> 32:26.654
Morning, everybody. Sorry we're late.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.531
We had to help our mom
with something.

32:28.615 --> 32:32.202
They've got a mother.
I was gonna get me one.

32:32.285 --> 32:34.037
What'd you do with the one you had?

32:34.079 --> 32:37.207
-He traded her for a box of cigars.
-Hey, they was Coronas!

32:37.248 --> 32:38.917
We have a father, too.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.211
A mother and a father.

32:41.294 --> 32:43.088
Hey, ain't we the hoi polloi?

32:43.171 --> 32:44.464
So, how's it going today?

32:44.547 --> 32:46.800
Ask me after they put up the headline.

32:48.093 --> 32:49.886
Here it comes now.

32:50.011 --> 32:53.556
"New newsie price. 60 cents per 100."

32:53.640 --> 32:54.724
-What'd you say?
-Is that news?

32:54.766 --> 32:55.767
It is to me!

32:55.850 --> 32:57.519
They jacked up the price of papes.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.020
10 cents more 100!

32:59.062 --> 33:00.605
I could eat two days on a dime!

33:00.689 --> 33:02.899
I'll be sleeping on the street.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.317
You already sleep on the street.

33:04.943 --> 33:06.945
-In a worse neighborhood.
-You're right.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.988
All right, what are you all
waiting around here for?

33:09.072 --> 33:10.365
Hey, Jack, get a load of this.

33:10.407 --> 33:12.951
Like Pulitzer
don't make enough already.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.244
Papes for the newsies!

33:14.285 --> 33:16.496
-Hey, relax. It's gotta be a gag.
-Line up, boys!

33:16.579 --> 33:19.541
Hey, good joke, Weasel.
You really had the fellas going.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.334
I'll take 100. Be on my way.

33:22.419 --> 33:23.920
100 will cost you 60.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.382
I ain't paying no 60.

33:27.424 --> 33:29.509
Well, then make way
for someone who will.

33:30.093 --> 33:32.429
You bet. Me and the fellas
will take a hike over to <i>The Journal.</i>

33:32.470 --> 33:35.015
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I'll save you the walk.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.599
They upped their price, too.

33:37.308 --> 33:39.102
Then we'll take our business
to <i>The Sun.</i>

33:39.144 --> 33:41.312
Same all around town.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.189
New day. New price.

33:43.273 --> 33:45.233
Hey, hey. Why the jack-up?

33:45.275 --> 33:48.111
Well, for them kind of answers,
you gotta ask further up the food chain.

33:48.153 --> 33:49.154
So...

33:49.446 --> 33:51.740
You buying or moving on?

33:55.952 --> 33:57.287
Come here, fellas.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.289
-Get over here. Come on.
-They can't just do that, can they?

33:59.372 --> 34:01.291
Hey, why not? It's their paper.

34:01.374 --> 34:03.126
-It's their world.
-Ain't we got no rights?

34:03.209 --> 34:04.210
We got the right to starve.

34:04.294 --> 34:06.463
Let's just get our papes
and hit the streets while we still can.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.257
Hey, hey.

34:09.299 --> 34:11.217
-Nobody's paying no new nothing.
-You got an idea?

34:11.301 --> 34:13.469
Would you keep your shirt on?
Let me think this through.

34:13.553 --> 34:16.639
-Stop crowding him!
-Hey, hey, hey...

34:17.014 --> 34:20.685
-Let the man work it out!
-Whoa, whoa.

34:25.273 --> 34:27.317
Hey, Jack, you still thinking?

34:28.693 --> 34:29.944
Sure he is.

34:30.362 --> 34:32.030
Can't you smell smoke?

34:32.155 --> 34:33.656
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.824
Hurry up. All right, here's the deal.

34:38.453 --> 34:42.415
If we don't sell papes,
nobody sells papes.

34:42.498 --> 34:45.877
Nobody gets to that window till they put
the price back where it belongs.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.379
What? You mean like a strike?

34:47.462 --> 34:49.464
Well, hey, you heard Davey,
we're on strike!

34:49.505 --> 34:50.924
Hold on. I didn't say that.

34:51.007 --> 34:54.803
We shut down this place just like
them workers shut down the trolleys.

34:54.844 --> 34:56.054
And the cops will bust our heads.

34:56.137 --> 34:58.431
Half of them strikers
is laid up with broke bones.

34:59.349 --> 35:02.143
Cops ain't gonna care
about a bunch of kids. Right, Davey?

35:02.185 --> 35:05.438
Leave me out of this.
I'm just here trying to feed my family.

35:05.522 --> 35:08.149
What? And the rest of us
is here on play time?

35:09.192 --> 35:11.403
Hey, hey.
Just 'cause we only make pennies

35:11.486 --> 35:13.697
don't give them the right
to rub our noses in it.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.616
It doesn't matter. You can't strike.
You're not a union.

35:17.951 --> 35:19.577
What if I says we is?

35:20.870 --> 35:23.873
There's a lot of stuff
you gotta have in order to be a union.

35:23.957 --> 35:26.376
Like membership.

35:28.378 --> 35:30.005
What do you call these guys?

35:30.046 --> 35:31.423
Hi!

35:31.506 --> 35:33.174
And officers.

35:33.216 --> 35:34.718
I nominate Jack president!

35:34.801 --> 35:36.511
Gee. I'm touched.

35:36.886 --> 35:38.179
How about a statement of purpose?

35:38.221 --> 35:40.056
Yeah, I must've left
that in my other pants.

35:40.098 --> 35:42.058
What's a statement of purpose?

35:42.183 --> 35:43.977
A reason for forming the union.

35:44.060 --> 35:46.104
Well, what reason
do the trolley workers have?

35:46.187 --> 35:47.397
I don't know.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.941
Wages, work hours, safety on the job.

35:50.025 --> 35:51.359
Who don't need that?

35:51.735 --> 35:52.777
Hey.

35:53.486 --> 35:56.239
I bet if your father had a union,

35:56.322 --> 35:59.743
you wouldn't need to be out here
selling papes right now, yeah?

36:00.243 --> 36:01.244
-Yeah.
-So...

36:01.786 --> 36:05.665
Our union is hereby formed
to watch each other's backs.

36:05.749 --> 36:08.960
Union'd we stand. Hey, that's not bad.
Somebody write that down.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.628
I got a pencil.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.797
Well, meet our Secretary of State.

36:13.006 --> 36:14.132
Now what?

36:14.215 --> 36:16.926
If you want a strike,
the membership's got to vote.

36:17.010 --> 36:20.138
Okay, so we'll vote.
What do you say, fellas?

36:20.221 --> 36:21.556
The choice is yours.

36:21.598 --> 36:24.768
Do we roll over
and let Pulitzer pick our pockets

36:24.809 --> 36:26.227
or do we strike?

36:26.269 --> 36:27.604
-Strike!
-Yeah!

36:27.687 --> 36:30.148
You heard the voice
of the membership.

36:30.231 --> 36:33.443
The Newsies of Lower Manhattan
are officially on strike.

36:33.485 --> 36:34.986
-Yeah!
-What's next?

36:35.070 --> 36:37.822
Wouldn't our strike be more effective
if someone in charge knew about it?

36:37.906 --> 36:41.576
Well, it would be a pleasure
to tell Wiesel myself.

36:42.285 --> 36:44.037
And who tells Pulitzer?

36:44.120 --> 36:45.789
-Davey?
-I don't know.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.879
-I guess you do, Mr. President.
-That's right.

36:52.962 --> 36:54.255
Hey, we do.

36:55.632 --> 36:56.966
So what... What do we tell him?

36:57.008 --> 37:00.720
Well, the newspaper owners need
to respect your rights as employees.

37:00.804 --> 37:03.181
Yeah, yeah. Pulitzer and Hearst
gotta respect the rights

37:03.264 --> 37:04.724
of the working kids of this city!

37:04.808 --> 37:07.143
Well, they can't just change the rules
when they feel like it!

37:07.185 --> 37:08.687
Yeah, that's right. We do the work!

37:08.770 --> 37:10.480
-So, we get a say!
-Yeah!

37:12.190 --> 37:13.817
We got a union!

37:16.778 --> 37:19.197
Pulitzer and Hearst,
they think we're nothing.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.032
-Are we nothing?
-No!

37:21.116 --> 37:24.160
They need to understand
that we're not enslaved to them.

37:24.202 --> 37:25.662
We are free agents.

37:25.704 --> 37:28.164
<i>Pulitzer and Hearst
they think they got us</i>

37:28.248 --> 37:30.125
<i>-Do they got us?
-No!</i>

37:30.500 --> 37:33.086
We're a union now.
The Newsboy Union,

37:33.169 --> 37:34.504
-and we mean business!
-Hey!

37:34.587 --> 37:36.923
<i>Even though
we ain't got hats or badges</i>

37:37.007 --> 37:41.845
<i>We're a union just by saying so</i>

37:41.928 --> 37:44.347
<i>And The World will know</i>

37:44.848 --> 37:47.350
What's to stop some other kids
coming along to sell our papes?

37:47.392 --> 37:49.728
-Just let them try!
-Yeah!

37:50.186 --> 37:51.855
We cannot beat up on other kids.

37:51.938 --> 37:53.440
-We're all in this together.
-All right, all right.

37:53.648 --> 37:56.151
<i>What's it gonna take
to stop the wagons?</i>

37:56.192 --> 37:57.402
<i>Are we ready?</i>

37:57.485 --> 37:58.611
Yeah!

37:58.695 --> 38:01.031
<i>What's it gonna take
to stop the scabbers?</i>

38:01.114 --> 38:02.365
<i>Can we do it?</i>

38:02.449 --> 38:03.533
Yeah!

38:03.616 --> 38:05.910
<i>We'll do what we gotta do until</i>

38:05.994 --> 38:11.041
<i>We break the will of mighty Bill and Joe</i>

38:11.082 --> 38:13.501
<i>And The World will know</i>

38:14.127 --> 38:15.587
<i>And The Journal, too</i>

38:16.796 --> 38:20.884
<i>Mr. Hearst and Pulitzer
have we got news for you</i>

38:21.718 --> 38:23.428
<i>See, The World don't know</i>

38:24.346 --> 38:26.222
<i>But they're gonna pay</i>

38:26.890 --> 38:30.894
<i>'Stead of hawkin' headlines
we'll be makin' 'em today</i>

38:30.977 --> 38:32.062
Hey!

38:32.145 --> 38:34.397
<i>And our ranks will grow</i>

38:34.481 --> 38:36.024
<i>And we'll kick their rear!</i>

38:36.066 --> 38:37.067
Yeah!

38:37.150 --> 38:41.488
<i>And The World will know
that we've been here!</i>

38:43.156 --> 38:45.200
<i>When the circulation bell starts ringing</i>

38:45.241 --> 38:46.326
<i>Will we hear it?</i>

38:46.701 --> 38:47.744
No!

38:48.078 --> 38:50.538
<i>What if the Delanceys
come out swinging?</i>

38:50.580 --> 38:51.915
<i>Will we hear it?</i>

38:51.998 --> 38:53.124
No!

38:53.208 --> 38:55.627
<i>When ya got 100 voices singing</i>

38:55.710 --> 38:59.839
<i>Who can hear a lousy whistle blow?</i>

39:00.465 --> 39:02.842
<i>And The World will know</i>

39:03.593 --> 39:05.345
<i>That this ain't no game</i>

39:06.262 --> 39:10.392
<i>That we got a ton
of rotten fruit and perfect aim</i>

39:11.142 --> 39:12.394
<i>So they gave their word</i>

39:13.853 --> 39:15.605
<i>Well, it ain't worth beans</i>

39:16.272 --> 39:20.777
<i>Now they gonna see
what "Stop the presses" really means</i>

39:21.319 --> 39:25.407
<i>And the old will weep
and go back to sleep</i>

39:26.449 --> 39:28.952
<i>And we got no choice
but to see it through</i>

39:28.993 --> 39:30.203
<i>And we found our voice</i>

39:30.286 --> 39:31.454
<i>And I lost my shoe</i>

39:31.496 --> 39:32.706
<i>And The World will...</i>

39:36.001 --> 39:37.377
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

39:37.460 --> 39:40.630
<i>Pulitzer may own The World
but he don't own us!</i>

39:40.672 --> 39:42.590
<i>Pulitzer may own The World
but he don't own us!</i>

39:42.632 --> 39:45.301
<i>Pulitzer may crack the whip
but he won't whip us!</i>

39:45.385 --> 39:49.597
<i>Pulitzer may crack the whip
but he won't whip us!</i>

39:50.348 --> 39:53.101
<i>And The World will know</i>

39:53.143 --> 39:55.603
<i>We been keepin' score</i>

39:55.645 --> 39:57.605
<i>Either they gives us our rights</i>

39:57.689 --> 39:59.899
<i>Or we gives them a war</i>

40:00.859 --> 40:02.485
<i>We've been down too long</i>

40:03.361 --> 40:05.655
<i>And we paid our dues</i>

40:05.739 --> 40:09.993
<i>And the things we do today
will be tomorrow's news</i>

40:10.910 --> 40:15.248
<i>And the die is cast
and the torch is passed</i>

40:15.999 --> 40:18.668
<i>And the roar will rise
from the streets below</i>

40:18.710 --> 40:21.046
<i>And our ranks will grow
and grow and grow</i>

40:21.129 --> 40:25.592
<i>And so The World will feel the fire</i>

40:25.675 --> 40:31.473
<i>And finally know</i>

40:40.982 --> 40:42.484
And stay out!

40:42.525 --> 40:46.321
You can tell Pulitzer
that a few days into this strike,

40:46.363 --> 40:49.824
he's gonna be beggin'
for an appointment to see me!

40:49.866 --> 40:51.034
You got that?

40:52.869 --> 40:54.329
He got it.

40:57.540 --> 41:00.418
<i>Pulitzer may own The World
but he don't own us!</i>

41:00.502 --> 41:02.587
<i>Pulitzer may own The World
but he don't own us!</i>

41:02.671 --> 41:04.964
<i>Pulitzer may crack the whip
but he won't whip us</i>

41:05.048 --> 41:08.426
<i>Pulitzer may crack the whip
but he won't whip us</i>

41:08.885 --> 41:10.428
<i>So The World says, "No!"</i>

41:10.845 --> 41:12.472
<i>Well, the kids do, too!</i>

41:12.555 --> 41:13.807
Come on!

41:13.890 --> 41:17.894
<i>Try to walk all over us
we'll stomp all over you!</i>

41:18.186 --> 41:19.813
<i>Can they kick us out?</i>

41:19.896 --> 41:20.897
No.

41:20.939 --> 41:22.315
<i>And take away our vote?</i>

41:22.399 --> 41:23.441
Come on.

41:23.525 --> 41:27.696
<i>Will we let 'em stuff
this crock of garbage down our throat?</i>

41:27.737 --> 41:28.947
No!

41:29.030 --> 41:33.743
<i>Every day we wait
is a day we lose!</i>

41:33.785 --> 41:36.413
<i>-And this ain't for fun!
-And it ain't for show!</i>

41:36.496 --> 41:38.957
<i>And we'll fight 'em
toe to toe to toe</i>

41:39.040 --> 41:42.711
<i>And so The World
will feel the fire</i>

41:42.752 --> 41:46.756
<i>And finally</i>

41:47.090 --> 41:49.843
<i>Finally know!</i>

42:08.987 --> 42:11.406
And a glass of water for you.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.116
And one for you.

42:14.200 --> 42:17.120
-And you and you and...
-Thank you.

42:17.162 --> 42:19.122
Who's the big spender
that ordered the seltzer?

42:19.789 --> 42:20.832
Over here.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.834
That'll be 2 cents.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.420
2 cents for a glass of seltzer?

42:25.462 --> 42:27.255
Just give me a water.

42:27.297 --> 42:29.424
How did I ever see that coming?

42:30.925 --> 42:34.929
I'd say we launched our strike
in a most auspicious manner.

42:34.971 --> 42:36.056
Yeah.

42:39.309 --> 42:40.393
I don't know about that.

42:41.353 --> 42:43.271
But we sure scared
the bejeebers outta Wiesel!

42:43.313 --> 42:46.149
And did you see the Delanceys?
They didn't know which way was up.

42:46.483 --> 42:48.485
Hey, hey. So, what's next?

42:48.526 --> 42:49.986
Now you have to spread the word.

42:50.070 --> 42:52.155
Let the rest of the city's newsies
know about the strike.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.324
Hey, you heard the man.
Let's split up. Let's spread the word.

42:54.366 --> 42:56.034
-I'll take Harlem.
-I got Midtown.

42:56.117 --> 42:57.994
-I got the Bronx.
-And I got the Bowery.

42:58.078 --> 42:59.662
-Specs, you take Queens.
-Yeah.

42:59.704 --> 43:01.331
-Tommy Boy, take the East Side.
-Hey.

43:01.373 --> 43:02.540
And who wants Brooklyn?

43:05.335 --> 43:07.504
Come on. Brooklyn.

43:07.545 --> 43:09.255
Spot Conlon's turf.

43:10.006 --> 43:11.007
Finch!

43:12.092 --> 43:13.385
You tellin' me
you're scared of Brooklyn?

43:14.344 --> 43:16.179
-I ain't scared of no turf!
-Okay.

43:18.098 --> 43:21.059
But that Spot Conlon
gets me a little jittery.

43:21.142 --> 43:23.061
Me and Davey will take Brooklyn.

43:23.144 --> 43:24.646
Me? No.

43:24.688 --> 43:26.690
Why is everyone
so scared of Brooklyn?

43:26.773 --> 43:27.857
Hey.

43:28.483 --> 43:29.734
What are you doing here?

43:31.361 --> 43:34.114
Asking a question.
Have you got an answer?

43:36.700 --> 43:39.494
Brooklyn is the sixth largest city
in the entire world.

43:39.536 --> 43:41.538
You got Brooklyn,
you hit the mother lode.

43:43.415 --> 43:47.252
Say, for someone who works
for <i>The New York Sun,</i>

43:47.377 --> 43:49.504
you are spending an awful lot of time
hanging around at <i>The World.</i>

43:50.839 --> 43:54.050
So what's that about, huh?
Are you following me?

43:54.884 --> 43:58.221
No. The only thing
I'm following is a story.

43:58.638 --> 44:00.724
A ragtag gang of ragamuffins

44:00.765 --> 44:03.810
wants to take on
the king makers of New York?

44:03.893 --> 44:05.729
Well, do you think you have a chance?

44:05.770 --> 44:07.147
Shouldn't you be at the ballet?

44:07.689 --> 44:11.109
Is the question too difficult?
I'll rephrase.

44:11.192 --> 44:14.529
Will the richest
and most powerful men in New York

44:14.571 --> 44:16.614
give the time of day to a gang of kids

44:16.698 --> 44:18.616
who haven't got a nickel to their name?

44:18.700 --> 44:21.244
Hey! You don't gotta be insultin'.

44:22.078 --> 44:23.329
I got a nickel.

44:24.622 --> 44:28.752
So, I guess you'd say you're a couple of
Davids looking to take on Goliath.

44:28.793 --> 44:30.795
-We never said that.
-Well, you didn't have to.

44:30.879 --> 44:32.505
I did.

44:32.589 --> 44:34.382
You know, I've seen
a lot of papes in my day

44:34.424 --> 44:38.261
and I ain't never noted
no girl reporters writing the hard news.

44:38.303 --> 44:42.432
Well, wake up to the new century.
The game's changing.

44:42.474 --> 44:45.769
Now, how about an exclusive interview?

44:45.810 --> 44:47.520
Ain't your beat entertainment?

44:47.604 --> 44:49.773
This is entertaining. So far.

44:49.814 --> 44:51.775
Hey, what's the last news story
you wrote?

44:51.816 --> 44:53.401
What's the last strike you organized?

44:54.235 --> 44:56.363
You're out of your league, Kelly.

44:56.446 --> 44:59.324
Methinks the lady needs to be
handled by a...

45:00.950 --> 45:02.494
Real man.

45:02.577 --> 45:04.871
You thinks wrong, Romeo.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.668
-How'd she know my name?
-Get outta here.

45:09.751 --> 45:13.838
I'd say we save any exclusive
for a real reporter.

45:13.922 --> 45:17.133
Well, do you see somebody else
giving you the time of day?

45:21.054 --> 45:25.475
All right. So I'm just busting
out of the social pages, but...

45:26.643 --> 45:28.103
But you give me the exclusive.

45:28.144 --> 45:29.646
Let me run with the story,

45:29.729 --> 45:32.774
and I promise I'll get you the space.

45:32.816 --> 45:35.318
Hey, you really think
we could be in the papes?

45:36.027 --> 45:38.863
Well, shut down a paper
like <i>The World?</i>

45:39.823 --> 45:42.075
You're gonna make the front page.

45:45.704 --> 45:47.288
You want a story?

45:48.331 --> 45:51.626
Be at the circulation gate
tomorrow mornin', and you'll get one.

45:51.668 --> 45:53.253
And bring your camera.

45:53.336 --> 45:55.672
You're gonna want to snap
a picture of this!

45:55.714 --> 45:56.715
Yeah!

45:57.549 --> 46:00.301
Boys, play outside.
I gotta set up for dinner

46:00.343 --> 46:02.012
and I got payin' customers
that need the tables.

46:02.053 --> 46:04.222
Now, come on! We got newsies to visit.

46:04.305 --> 46:08.476
Hey, you won't be shooin' us off
when we get our mugs in the papes!

46:08.518 --> 46:09.811
Yeah!

46:10.353 --> 46:12.105
<i>And The World will know</i>

46:12.897 --> 46:14.524
<i>We been keepin' score</i>

46:15.191 --> 46:17.110
<i>Either they gives us our rights</i>

46:17.193 --> 46:19.195
<i>Or we gives them a war</i>

46:20.155 --> 46:21.781
<i>We've been down too long</i>

46:22.574 --> 46:24.367
<i>And we paid our dues</i>

46:25.118 --> 46:29.372
<i>And the things we do today
will be tomorrow's news</i>

46:29.998 --> 46:32.542
<i>And the die is cast</i>

46:32.625 --> 46:34.502
<i>And the torch is passed</i>

46:35.045 --> 46:37.589
<i>-And the roar will rise
-From the streets below</i>

46:37.672 --> 46:40.216
<i>And our ranks will grow
and grow and grow</i>

46:40.258 --> 46:43.970
<i>And so The World
will feel the fire</i>

46:44.054 --> 46:46.556
<i>And finally know!</i>

46:46.598 --> 46:49.059
Hey, come on, Les.
The folks are waitin'.

46:52.562 --> 46:54.564
So, what's your story?

46:55.231 --> 46:58.568
Are you selling newspapers
to work your way through art school?

46:59.569 --> 47:02.030
Art school? Are you kiddin' me?

47:02.072 --> 47:03.573
But you're an artist.

47:03.615 --> 47:05.492
You've got real talent.

47:05.575 --> 47:09.788
You should be inside the paper
illustrating, not outside hawking it.

47:09.871 --> 47:11.456
Maybe that ain't what I want.

47:11.539 --> 47:13.083
So tell me what you want.

47:16.044 --> 47:18.755
Can't you see it in my eyes?

47:19.464 --> 47:20.799
Yeah, okay.

47:21.841 --> 47:24.010
Have you always been their leader?

47:24.094 --> 47:26.513
Hey, I'm a blowhard.
Davey is the brains.

47:26.888 --> 47:30.183
Modesty is not a quality
I would've pinned on you.

47:30.266 --> 47:31.643
You got a name?

47:31.726 --> 47:34.104
Katherine... Plumber.

47:34.938 --> 47:36.648
What's the matter? Ain't you sure?

47:36.731 --> 47:38.775
It's my byline.

47:38.817 --> 47:40.819
-The name I publish under.
-Yeah.

47:40.902 --> 47:43.113
So tell me about tomorrow.

47:43.154 --> 47:44.781
What are you hoping for?

47:45.281 --> 47:48.159
I'd rather tell you
what I'm hopin' for tonight.

47:48.243 --> 47:50.078
Mr. Kelly...

47:51.037 --> 47:54.416
Today, we stop the newsies
from carrying out the papes.

47:54.457 --> 47:57.085
But the wagons
still deliver to the rest of the city.

47:57.627 --> 47:59.004
Tomorrow...

48:00.130 --> 48:01.464
We stop the wagons.

48:02.298 --> 48:03.299
Are you scared?

48:03.341 --> 48:04.342
Do I look scared?

48:06.761 --> 48:08.138
But ask me again in the mornin'.

48:08.722 --> 48:10.223
Good answer.

48:10.306 --> 48:12.017
Good night, Mr. Kelly.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.061
Hey! Hey, where are you runnin'?
It ain't even supper time.

48:15.145 --> 48:17.147
I'll see you in the morning.

48:17.230 --> 48:19.983
And off the record...

48:21.151 --> 48:22.360
Good luck.

48:25.155 --> 48:27.073
Hey! Hey! Hey, Plumber!

48:30.702 --> 48:31.828
Write it good.

48:32.245 --> 48:34.205
We both got a lot riding on you.

48:40.462 --> 48:42.130
You heard the man.

48:42.172 --> 48:43.715
"Write it good."

48:43.798 --> 48:47.344
Write it good or it's back to wheezing
your way through the flower show.

48:48.678 --> 48:50.013
No pressure.

48:50.764 --> 48:52.349
Let's go.

48:53.641 --> 48:56.519
"Newsies Stop The World."

48:57.270 --> 48:59.356
A little hyperbole never hurt anyone.

49:00.106 --> 49:02.734
"With all eyes fixed
on the trolley strike,

49:02.817 --> 49:05.403
"there's another battle brewing
in the city."

49:07.822 --> 49:09.824
And if I could just write about it...

49:09.866 --> 49:11.826
Come on, Katherine!

49:11.868 --> 49:14.079
Those boys are counting on you.

49:14.579 --> 49:16.498
You poor boys.

49:17.749 --> 49:19.542
<i>Write what you know
so they say</i>

49:19.584 --> 49:21.503
<i>All I know is I don't know
what to write</i>

49:21.544 --> 49:23.004
<i>Or the right way to write it</i>

49:23.046 --> 49:24.923
<i>This is big, lady, don't screw it up</i>

49:25.006 --> 49:28.843
<i>This is not some little
vaudeville I'm reviewing</i>

49:28.885 --> 49:31.513
<i>Poor little kids versus
rich, greedy sourpusses</i>

49:31.554 --> 49:34.224
<i>Ha! It's a cinch!
It could practically write itself</i>

49:34.307 --> 49:35.558
<i>And let's pray it does</i>

49:35.600 --> 49:36.810
<i>'Cause as I may have mentioned</i>

49:36.893 --> 49:39.646
<i>I have no clue what I'm doing</i>

49:39.729 --> 49:41.022
<i>Am I insane?</i>

49:41.064 --> 49:42.524
<i>This is what
I've been waiting for</i>

49:42.565 --> 49:45.110
<i>Well, that, plus the screaming
of 10 angry editors</i>

49:45.193 --> 49:47.987
<i>A girl? It's a girl!
How the hell? Is that even legal?</i>

49:48.071 --> 49:50.782
<i>Look, just go and get her!</i>

49:50.865 --> 49:53.576
<i>Not only that
There's a story behind the story</i>

49:53.618 --> 49:55.787
<i>Thousands of children
exploited, invisible</i>

49:55.870 --> 49:57.205
<i>Speak up, take a stand</i>

49:57.247 --> 49:58.748
<i>And there's someone
to write about it</i>

49:58.790 --> 50:01.710
<i>That's how things get better</i>

50:01.751 --> 50:04.838
<i>Give life's little guys some ink</i>

50:04.921 --> 50:10.385
<i>And when it dries
just watch what happens</i>

50:11.219 --> 50:15.140
<i>Those kids will live
and breathe right on the page</i>

50:15.223 --> 50:18.101
<i>And once they're center stage</i>

50:18.143 --> 50:21.146
<i>You watch what happens</i>

50:22.105 --> 50:26.276
<i>And who's there
with her camera and her pen</i>

50:26.359 --> 50:29.195
<i>As boys turn into men</i>

50:29.279 --> 50:31.698
<i>They'll storm
the gates and then</i>

50:31.781 --> 50:36.244
<i>Just watch what happens
when they do</i>

50:38.747 --> 50:39.956
Okay.

50:40.874 --> 50:45.086
"A modern day David is poised
to take on the rich and powerful Goliath

50:45.420 --> 50:48.089
"with the swagger of one twice his age.

50:48.131 --> 50:51.634
"Armed with nothing more
than a few nuggets of truth,

50:51.676 --> 50:55.764
"Jack Kelly stands ready to face
the behemoth Pulitzer."

50:57.640 --> 51:00.643
Now that is how you turn
a boy into a legend.

51:00.727 --> 51:03.396
<i>Picture a handsome
heroically charismatic</i>

51:03.480 --> 51:06.941
<i>Plain spoken, know-nothing
skirt-chasing cocky little son of a...</i>

51:06.983 --> 51:08.151
<i>Lie down with dogs</i>

51:08.193 --> 51:11.696
<i>And you wake up
with a raise and a promotion</i>

51:11.780 --> 51:14.449
<i>So, he's a flirt, a complete egomaniac</i>

51:14.491 --> 51:17.619
<i>The fact is he's also
the face of the strike, what a face</i>

51:17.660 --> 51:22.665
<i>Face the fact, that's a face that could
save us all from sinking in the ocean</i>

51:22.707 --> 51:23.833
<i>Like someone said</i>

51:23.875 --> 51:26.044
<i>"Power tends to corrupt
and absolute power..."</i>

51:26.127 --> 51:27.754
<i>Wait! Wait!
"Corrupts absolutely"</i>

51:27.837 --> 51:30.048
<i>That is genius!
But give me some time</i>

51:30.131 --> 51:31.508
<i>I'll be twice as good as that</i>

51:31.549 --> 51:33.718
<i>Six months from never</i>

51:33.802 --> 51:36.346
<i>Just look around
at the world we're inheriting</i>

51:36.429 --> 51:38.223
<i>And think of the one we'll create</i>

51:38.306 --> 51:39.683
<i>Their mistake is they got old</i>

51:39.724 --> 51:41.601
<i>That is not a mistake
we'll be making</i>

51:41.685 --> 51:44.813
<i>No, sir, we'll stay young forever!</i>

51:44.854 --> 51:47.607
<i>Give those kids and me</i>

51:47.691 --> 51:50.026
<i>The brand new century</i>

51:50.110 --> 51:53.488
<i>And watch what happens</i>

51:54.114 --> 51:56.783
<i>It's David and Goliath</i>

51:56.866 --> 52:00.453
<i>Do or die, the fight is on</i>

52:00.537 --> 52:04.708
<i>And I can't watch what happens</i>

52:05.458 --> 52:09.421
<i>But all I know is nothing happens</i>

52:09.504 --> 52:11.923
<i>If you just give in</i>

52:12.007 --> 52:15.093
<i>It can't be any worse</i>

52:15.176 --> 52:17.387
<i>Than how it's been</i>

52:17.429 --> 52:22.642
<i>And it just so happens
that we just might win</i>

52:22.726 --> 52:27.564
<i>So whatever happens...</i>

52:28.106 --> 52:31.568
<i>Let's begin!</i>

52:52.797 --> 52:54.758
-Is anyone else comin'?
-I've got no clue.

52:54.799 --> 52:57.093
Hey, well, you've seen
Spot Conlon, right?

52:58.178 --> 52:59.888
-What, what'd he say?
-Yeah, sure, we seen him.

52:59.929 --> 53:01.389
Him and about 20 of his gang.

53:01.431 --> 53:03.016
And them Brooklyn boys is big.

53:03.099 --> 53:05.602
And... And I gotta say,
Spot was very impressed.

53:05.643 --> 53:06.936
-Wasn't he?
-I'd say.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.730
All right, so, they're with us?

53:08.772 --> 53:11.107
That all depends on how you look at it.

53:11.191 --> 53:13.443
If you look and see Brooklyn,
then they're with us.

53:13.485 --> 53:16.446
Yeah, they wanted proof we weren't
gonna fold at the first sign of trouble.

53:16.488 --> 53:17.614
Are we?

53:18.156 --> 53:19.616
We are not! No!

53:19.657 --> 53:22.619
-There's us, there's Harlem...
-Well, not so fast, boss.

53:22.702 --> 53:25.288
Harlem wants to know
what Brooklyn's gonna do.

53:25.330 --> 53:26.331
What about Queens?

53:26.414 --> 53:28.458
Queens will be right here
backing us up.

53:29.042 --> 53:31.294
As soon as we get
the nod from Brooklyn.

53:31.336 --> 53:33.463
I got the same fish-eye in Midtown.

53:33.546 --> 53:35.048
Say, Oscar,

53:35.632 --> 53:37.217
it looks like we got bum information

53:37.300 --> 53:39.135
about a strike happenin' here today.

53:39.636 --> 53:41.471
Not that I'm complaining.

53:42.097 --> 53:44.349
I know my skull-bustin' arm
could use a day of rest.

53:44.432 --> 53:46.685
Hey. Are you done?

53:48.937 --> 53:50.939
Are we doing the right thing?

53:51.648 --> 53:52.649
Sure we are.

53:52.857 --> 53:54.818
Maybe we should
put this off a few days.

53:54.859 --> 53:56.486
No, we cannot just put this...

53:58.113 --> 54:00.115
Jack, they are not...

54:02.659 --> 54:05.286
Say something.
Tell 'em if we back off now,

54:05.328 --> 54:06.663
they will never listen to us again!

54:06.705 --> 54:07.914
Hey, hey!

54:07.997 --> 54:09.332
We can't back down now, all right?

54:09.374 --> 54:10.917
No matter who does or doesn't show.

54:11.251 --> 54:13.294
You like it or not,
now is when we take a stand.

54:13.837 --> 54:15.922
How's about
we just don't show up for work?

54:16.006 --> 54:17.257
That'll send a message.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.800
No! They'll just replace us.

54:18.842 --> 54:21.052
They need to see us stand our ground.

54:22.345 --> 54:24.014
-Davey.
-What?

54:24.055 --> 54:26.057
-You tell them.
-I... Jack...

54:29.394 --> 54:34.357
<i>Now is the time
to seize the day</i>

54:34.816 --> 54:36.860
<i>Stare down the odds</i>

54:36.943 --> 54:40.030
<i>And seize the day</i>

54:40.113 --> 54:42.949
<i>Minute by minute</i>

54:43.033 --> 54:45.535
<i>That's how you win it</i>

54:45.618 --> 54:49.706
<i>We will find a way</i>

54:50.373 --> 54:54.294
<i>But let us seize the day</i>

54:55.211 --> 54:58.256
Hey, Jack, look what I made.
Good, huh?

54:59.424 --> 55:01.009
Strike!

55:01.051 --> 55:02.719
That's great.

55:03.970 --> 55:05.221
That's pitiful.

55:06.014 --> 55:07.766
Don't be so quick to judge.

55:07.849 --> 55:10.977
Maybe Pulitzer will see it
out his window and feel sorry for us.

55:11.061 --> 55:12.437
Hey, Specs, any sign
of reinforcements?

55:16.608 --> 55:18.276
Davey, Davey, come on.

55:18.360 --> 55:23.198
<i>Courage cannot
erase our fear</i>

55:24.157 --> 55:28.078
<i>Courage is when
we face our fear</i>

55:28.578 --> 55:30.997
<i>Tell those with power</i>

55:31.081 --> 55:33.667
<i>Safe in their tower</i>

55:33.750 --> 55:37.087
<i>We will not obey</i>

55:41.091 --> 55:46.429
<i>Behold the brave battalion
that stands side-by-side</i>

55:46.513 --> 55:48.765
<i>Too few in number</i>

55:48.807 --> 55:50.725
<i>And too proud to hide</i>

55:51.309 --> 55:53.853
<i>Then say to the others</i>

55:53.937 --> 55:56.773
<i>Who did not follow through</i>

55:57.232 --> 55:59.192
<i>You're still our brothers</i>

55:59.275 --> 56:01.736
<i>And we will fight for you</i>

56:04.614 --> 56:06.032
-We doin' this?
-Yeah.

56:07.575 --> 56:12.831
<i>Now is the time
to seize the day</i>

56:12.914 --> 56:17.419
<i>Stare down the odds
and seize the day</i>

56:17.877 --> 56:22.424
<i>Once we've begun, if we stand as one</i>

56:22.465 --> 56:27.554
<i>Someday becomes somehow</i>

56:27.637 --> 56:32.809
<i>And a prayer becomes a vow</i>

56:32.892 --> 56:36.104
<i>And the strike starts</i>

56:36.146 --> 56:39.941
<i>Right damn now!</i>

56:40.316 --> 56:42.986
The sun is up. The birds are singin'.

56:43.028 --> 56:45.822
It's a beautiful day
to crack some heads.

56:46.656 --> 56:47.824
Ain't it?

56:48.867 --> 56:50.535
Step right up and get your papes.

56:50.618 --> 56:52.662
Are you workin' or trespassin'?

56:52.704 --> 56:53.830
What's your pleasure?

56:53.872 --> 56:55.165
-Who are they?
-Scabs!

56:55.206 --> 56:57.751
They think they can just waltz in here
and take our jobs?

56:57.834 --> 57:00.003
-We can handle them!
-Let's soak 'em, boys!

57:00.045 --> 57:02.547
No, no, no! We all stand together!

57:02.630 --> 57:04.466
Or we don't have a chance!

57:04.507 --> 57:06.676
-Jack!
-Yeah, I know. I hear ya.

57:07.594 --> 57:08.595
Fellas...

57:12.891 --> 57:15.143
I know someone put youse up to this.

57:15.185 --> 57:17.645
Yeah, they probably paid you
some extra money, too, huh?

57:18.646 --> 57:20.315
Yeah, well, it ain't right.

57:21.900 --> 57:24.110
Pulitzer thinks we are gutter rats.

57:24.194 --> 57:26.529
With no... No respect for nothin',
including each other.

57:26.613 --> 57:27.864
Is that who we are, huh?

57:27.947 --> 57:29.908
Well, we stab each other in the back

57:29.991 --> 57:31.534
and, yeah, that's who we are.

57:31.576 --> 57:33.036
But if we stand together,

57:33.703 --> 57:35.705
we can change the whole game.

57:42.879 --> 57:44.673
And it ain't just about us!

57:45.465 --> 57:49.010
Yeah, all across the city,
there are boys and girls

57:49.052 --> 57:51.054
who ought to be out playin'
or going to school!

57:51.096 --> 57:55.141
Instead they are slavin' to support
themselves and... And their folks!

57:56.893 --> 57:58.812
Ain't no crime to bein' poor!

57:59.729 --> 58:02.565
No, not a one of us complains
if the work we do is hard.

58:02.607 --> 58:04.651
All we ask is a square deal.

58:07.904 --> 58:10.490
For the sake of all the kids

58:10.949 --> 58:15.120
in every sweatshop,
factory and slaughterhouse in this city,

58:15.203 --> 58:17.330
I beg you, throw down your papers...

58:19.833 --> 58:21.251
And join the strike.

58:22.794 --> 58:23.962
Please?

58:25.422 --> 58:27.424
Hey! What are you doing? Come on.

58:30.677 --> 58:31.886

<i>Answer the call

58:43.273 --> 58:44.941
<i>Answer the call
and don't delay</i>

58:45.025 --> 58:48.945
<i>Wrongs will be righted
if we're united!</i>

58:48.987 --> 58:52.824
<i>Let us seize the day!</i>

58:52.907 --> 58:53.908

58:54.117 --> 58:55.660

58:55.744 --> 58:57.829
Hey, at the end of the day,
who are you gonna trust?

58:57.912 --> 58:59.581
Them or them?

01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:16.092
Come on, fellas.

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:55.965

It's about time you showed up.

They're slaughtering us.

Shut it, crip.

Well, it's off to the Refuge

And don't never say
I don't give you nothin'.

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.744
And before you say water is nothin',

01:10:02.786 --> 01:10:05.580
just ask a fish in the desert.

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:15.423
Why do old people talk?

01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:19.219
To prove they's still alive.

01:10:20.136 --> 01:10:22.013
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:10:22.972 --> 01:10:25.809
Would you get a load
of these glum mugs.

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:27.769
Wait, can these really be
the same boys

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:30.730
who made front page
of <i>The New York Sun?</i>

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:35.985
Would ya look it! That's me!

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:39.322
Where's me? Where's me?

01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:41.616
Wait till my old man gets a load of this!

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:45.745
I won't be last
in line for the tub tonight!

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:49.874
-You got us in the paper?
-You got yourselves in the pape.

"Newsies Stop The World."

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.337
Now there's a headline
even Elmer could sell.

01:10:57.132 --> 01:10:58.508
So, what else you got?

01:10:58.591 --> 01:11:00.552
Mine's the only story that ran.

01:11:00.927 --> 01:11:02.846
Pulitzer declared
a blackout on strike news,

01:11:02.929 --> 01:11:04.764
so even I'm shut down now.

01:11:05.807 --> 01:11:09.060
Hey, I heard they arrested Crutchie.
Did they get Jack, too?

01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:11.021
The Delanceys are spreading a story

01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:13.398
that he took it on the lam
first sight of the cops.

01:11:13.523 --> 01:11:15.400
Jack don't run from no fight.

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:17.068
Take it down, shortstop.

01:11:17.152 --> 01:11:18.778
I'm just reporting the news.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:22.991
For jumping Jack's sake,
can you stow the seriosity

01:11:23.033 --> 01:11:27.579
long enough to just
drink in the moment?

01:11:28.705 --> 01:11:30.123
I'm famous!

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:33.335
Yeah, what of it?

01:11:35.712 --> 01:11:37.797
Well, are you stupid or what?

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:38.882
When you're famous,

01:11:39.549 --> 01:11:41.968
the world is your erster.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:44.888

01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:47.640
Your erster.

01:11:47.724 --> 01:11:48.892
What are you saying?

01:11:49.642 --> 01:11:50.727
Your erster.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:54.230
Hey, you know, your fancy clam
with the pearl inside.

01:11:55.607 --> 01:11:59.027
All right!
How much does being famous pay?

01:11:59.069 --> 01:12:01.237
No, you don't need money
when you're famous.

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.490
They gives you whatever you want.

01:12:03.573 --> 01:12:04.657
Gratis.

01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:05.992
Such as?

01:12:06.701 --> 01:12:09.579
<i>A pair of new shoes

01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:12.248

<i>-So let's get drunk!
-Yeah!</i>

01:13:11.141 --> 01:13:13.977
<i>Not with liquor, fame works quicker</i>

01:13:14.019 --> 01:13:15.979
<i>When you're King of New York</i>

01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:18.314
<i>I gotta be either dead
or dreamin'</i>

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:21.109
<i>'Cause look at that pape
with my face beamin'</i>

01:13:21.151 --> 01:13:23.820
<i>Tomorrow they may wrap
fishes in it</i>

01:13:23.903 --> 01:13:26.865
<i>But I was a star
for one whole minute!</i>

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.293
Come on, boys!

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:09.240
Yeah!

01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:31.429
Got 'em!

01:15:07.465 --> 01:15:08.466
That's it?

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:11.469
You gotta be kidding me.

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:21.813
Let's go...

01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:23.982
Come on, Katherine!

01:16:04.272 --> 01:16:08.234
<i>Look at me
I'm the King of New York!</i>

01:16:09.778 --> 01:16:10.820
<i>Wait and see</i>

01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:14.032
<i>This is gonna make
both the Delanceys</i>

01:16:14.115 --> 01:16:15.408
<i>Pee in their pant-sies</i>

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:18.453
<i>Flashpots are shootin'
bright as the sun!</i>

01:16:18.495 --> 01:16:20.955
<i>I'm one highfalutin'
son of a gun!</i>

01:16:20.997 --> 01:16:22.540
<i>I guarantee</i>

01:16:22.624 --> 01:16:25.460
<i>Though I crapped out
I ain't tapped out!</i>

01:16:25.502 --> 01:16:27.045
<i>I'm the King of New...</i>

01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:29.547
<i>Friends may flee, let 'em ditch ya!</i>

01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:32.425
<i>Snap one pit'cha!
You're the King of New...</i>

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:33.843
<i>History!</i>

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:36.554
<i>Front page story, guts and glory</i>

01:16:36.638 --> 01:16:38.014
<i>I'm the King...</i>

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:45.021
<i>Of New York!</i>

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:51.921
"Dear Jack...

01:17:54.424 --> 01:17:56.259
"Greetings from the Refuge."

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:00.597
<i>How are you?</i>

01:18:01.598 --> 01:18:03.099
<i>I'm okay</i>

01:18:03.975 --> 01:18:06.853
<i>Guess I wasn't
much help yesterday</i>

01:18:07.479 --> 01:18:10.273
<i>Snyder soaked me
real good with my crutch</i>

01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:12.817
<i>Oh, yeah, Jack</i>

01:18:13.693 --> 01:18:15.612
<i>This is Crutchie, by the way</i>

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.407
<i>These here guards</i>

01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:21.284
<i>They is rude</i>

01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:25.080
<i>They say jump, boy, you jump
or you're screwed</i>

01:18:25.121 --> 01:18:28.750
<i>But the food ain't so bad, least so far</i>

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:32.462
<i>'Cause so far
they ain't brung us no food</i>

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:36.174
"Ha. Ha."

01:18:38.426 --> 01:18:40.303
<i>I miss the rooftop</i>

01:18:41.262 --> 01:18:45.058
<i>Sleepin' right out in the open</i>

01:18:45.141 --> 01:18:48.228
<i>In your penthouse in the sky</i>

01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:50.647
<i>There's a cool breeze blowin'</i>

01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:54.025
<i>Even in July</i>

01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:57.153
<i>Anyway</i>

01:18:57.195 --> 01:18:59.030
<i>So, guess what?</i>

01:18:59.114 --> 01:19:02.117
<i>There's a secret
escape plan I got</i>

01:19:02.158 --> 01:19:05.412
<i>Tie a sheet to the bed
Toss the end out the window</i>

01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:08.331
<i>Climb down
then take off like a shot</i>

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:11.918
<i>Maybe though
Not tonight</i>

01:19:12.627 --> 01:19:15.588
<i>I ain't slept
and my leg still ain't right</i>

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:18.425
<i>Hey, but Pulitzer, he's going down!</i>

01:19:18.508 --> 01:19:22.595
<i>And then, Jack
I was thinking we might just go</i>

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:25.974
<i>Like you was saying</i>

01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:29.811
<i>Where it's clean
and green and pretty</i>

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:32.856
<i>With no buildings
in your way</i>

01:19:32.897 --> 01:19:38.153
<i>And you're ridin'
palominos every day</i>

01:19:39.362 --> 01:19:41.364
<i>Once that train makes...</i>

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.453
Damn this place.

01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:51.124
<i>I'll be fine</i>

01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:53.209
<i>Good as new</i>

01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:56.087
<i>But there's one thing
I need you to do</i>

01:19:56.755 --> 01:19:58.173
<i>On the rooftop, you said</i>

01:19:58.214 --> 01:20:02.135
<i>That a family looks out
for each other</i>

01:20:02.218 --> 01:20:05.221
<i>So you tell all the fellas for me</i>

01:20:05.263 --> 01:20:09.142
<i>To protect one another</i>

01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:12.270
<i>The end</i>

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.773
<i>Your friend</i>

01:20:17.233 --> 01:20:20.070
<i>Your best friend</i>

01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:24.532
<i>Your brother</i>

01:20:25.575 --> 01:20:27.327
<i>Crutchie</i>

01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:29.579
All right, enough already.

01:21:02.153 --> 01:21:05.490
Here's everything I owe you
for the first backdrop.

01:21:05.573 --> 01:21:07.617
Plus this one.

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:09.369
And even a little something extra,

01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.205
just account'a
because I'm gonna miss you so.

01:21:12.288 --> 01:21:14.374
-Miss Medda, I...
-Jack.

01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:19.295
You're a gem.

01:21:19.796 --> 01:21:22.298
Just tell me you're goin' somewhere,

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.134
not running away.

01:21:25.969 --> 01:21:27.095
Does it matter?

01:21:27.345 --> 01:21:28.847
When you go somewhere

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.391
and it turns out
not to be the right place,

01:21:31.474 --> 01:21:34.561
you can always go somewhere else.

01:21:35.895 --> 01:21:37.939
But if you're running away,

01:21:38.648 --> 01:21:42.110
nowhere is ever the right place.

01:21:42.152 --> 01:21:44.696
How about lettin' a pal
know you're alive?

01:21:48.324 --> 01:21:50.285
Why don't I leave you with your friend.

01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:52.829
Where did you go? We couldn't find ya.

01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:55.707
You ever think I didn't wanna be found?

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:58.418
Hey, is that a real place?
That Santa Fe?

01:21:59.336 --> 01:22:01.087
Hey, did you see the papes?

01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:03.590
We are front page news above the fold!

01:22:03.673 --> 01:22:05.800
Yes. Above

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:07.844
the fold.

01:22:08.386 --> 01:22:09.679
Good for you.

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:12.557
Everyone wants to meet
the famous Jack Kelly.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.809
Even Spot Conlon
sent over a kid just to say,

01:22:14.851 --> 01:22:17.437
"Next event you can
count on Brooklyn." How about that?

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.647
We got stomped into the ground.

01:22:21.107 --> 01:22:24.027
Yeah, they got us this time.
I'll grant you that.

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:25.445
But we took round one,

01:22:25.528 --> 01:22:28.365
and with press like this,
our fight is far from over.

01:22:28.531 --> 01:22:31.242
Every newsie who could walk
was out there this morning,

01:22:31.326 --> 01:22:33.870
selling papes
like the strike never happened.

01:22:33.953 --> 01:22:36.039
And I was right out there with them.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.542
If I don't sell papes, my folks don't eat.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:42.128
Save your breath. I get it. It's hopeless.

01:22:42.212 --> 01:22:46.049
But then I saw this look
on Wiesel's face.

01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:48.677
He was actually nervous

01:22:48.718 --> 01:22:51.262
and I realized this isn't over.

01:22:51.346 --> 01:22:52.555
We got 'em worried.

01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.683
Really worried.

01:22:54.724 --> 01:22:56.476
And I walked away.

01:22:56.893 --> 01:22:58.269
Lots of other kids did, too.

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.563
And that is what you call a beginning.

01:23:00.647 --> 01:23:03.149
There he is, just like I said.

01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.901
For cryin' out loud,
where's a fella gotta go

01:23:04.984 --> 01:23:06.653
to get away from you people?

01:23:06.903 --> 01:23:09.072
There's no escapin' us, pal.
We're inevitable.

01:23:10.281 --> 01:23:12.409
So, what's the story?
Can we have the theater?

01:23:12.492 --> 01:23:13.827
Pipe down. I didn't ask yet.

01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:14.911
What's the holdup?

01:23:14.994 --> 01:23:17.580
I need to let my girl
know we've got a date.

01:23:17.622 --> 01:23:18.665
Your girl?

01:23:18.748 --> 01:23:19.749
You heard me!

01:23:19.833 --> 01:23:22.460
I've been swattin' skirts
away all morning.

01:23:22.752 --> 01:23:24.879
Fame is one intoxicating potion.

01:23:24.921 --> 01:23:27.924
And this here girl, Sally, she's a plum.

01:23:30.593 --> 01:23:32.887
Word is, you wrote a great story.

01:23:32.929 --> 01:23:34.264
Hey, you look like hell.

01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:36.599
Hey, Jack,
where's that supposed to be?

01:23:36.683 --> 01:23:37.851
It's Santa Fe.

01:23:38.393 --> 01:23:39.602
I gotta tell you, Jack.

01:23:39.644 --> 01:23:42.981
This "Go west, young man!"
routine is getting tired.

01:23:43.273 --> 01:23:45.608
Even Horace Greeley
moved back to New York.

01:23:45.942 --> 01:23:46.943
Yes, he did.

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.445
And then he died.

01:23:51.614 --> 01:23:54.951
Ain't reporters supposed
to be non-partisan?

01:23:55.035 --> 01:23:56.619
Ask a reporter?

01:23:56.661 --> 01:23:59.748
Pulitzer's had me blacklisted
from every news desk in town.

01:23:59.789 --> 01:24:03.335
Can we table the palaver
and get back to business?

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:05.170
Will Medda let us have the theater?

01:24:05.253 --> 01:24:06.880
It's what I been tryin' to tell ya.

01:24:06.963 --> 01:24:09.549
We wanna hold a rally,
a citywide meeting

01:24:09.632 --> 01:24:12.093
where every newsie
gets a say and a vote.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:13.261
And...

01:24:13.887 --> 01:24:16.806
We do it after working hours
so no one loses a day's pay.

01:24:17.349 --> 01:24:18.350
Smart?

01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:22.062
Yeah, smart enough
to get you committed to a padded room.

01:24:22.437 --> 01:24:26.274
The guy who paints places
he's never seen is calling us crazy?

01:24:29.736 --> 01:24:31.780
You wanna see a place I seen, huh?

01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:34.783
How about this?

01:24:39.037 --> 01:24:41.581
Newsie Square,
thanks to my big mouth,

01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:44.668
filled to overflowing with failure.

01:24:45.293 --> 01:24:47.170
Kids hurt, others arrested!

01:24:47.253 --> 01:24:48.880
Lighten up. No one died.

01:24:49.839 --> 01:24:51.299
Is that what you're aimin' for?

01:24:52.342 --> 01:24:53.343
No, no, go on.

01:24:53.426 --> 01:24:55.178
Call me a coward. You call me a quitter.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.180
Ain't no way
I'm puttin' them kids back in danger.

01:24:57.222 --> 01:25:00.392
We're doing something
that's never been done before!

01:25:00.475 --> 01:25:02.602
How could that not be dangerous?

01:25:04.688 --> 01:25:07.315
Specs brung me a note from Crutchie

01:25:07.357 --> 01:25:08.942
at the Refuge.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.363
I tried to go see him.
I went up the fire escape.

01:25:14.739 --> 01:25:17.867
They busted him up so bad,
he couldn't even come to the window.

01:25:20.453 --> 01:25:22.330
Now, what if he don't make it, huh?

01:25:22.372 --> 01:25:24.541
Are you...
Are you willin' to shoulder that?

01:25:24.582 --> 01:25:26.126
For what, half a penny a pape?

01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:28.378
It's not about pennies, Jack!

01:25:29.796 --> 01:25:31.089
You said it yourself.

01:25:31.172 --> 01:25:35.552
My family wouldn't be in the mess we're
in if my father had a union.

01:25:35.635 --> 01:25:37.721
This is a fight we have to win!

01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:40.598
If I wanted a sermon,
I would show up for church.

01:25:42.183 --> 01:25:45.103
Tell me how quitting
does Crutchie any good.

01:25:46.896 --> 01:25:48.106
Exactly.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:51.443
<i>So here's how it goes
once we win</i>

01:25:51.526 --> 01:25:53.403
<i>And we will be winning
Make no mistake</i>

01:25:53.445 --> 01:25:54.821
<i>-We'll be what?
-We're already winning</i>

01:25:54.904 --> 01:25:56.740
<i>-Oh, right
-And we'll tell 'em straight out</i>

01:25:56.823 --> 01:25:59.993
<i>They let Crutchie go
or they keep getting pounded</i>

01:26:00.076 --> 01:26:01.578
<i>Oh, Dave
What the hell?</i>

01:26:01.661 --> 01:26:03.246
<i>Did they bust up
your brains or somethin'?</i>

01:26:03.329 --> 01:26:05.749
<i>As I recall, Dave
we all got our asses kicked</i>

01:26:05.832 --> 01:26:06.958
<i>-They won!
-Won the battle</i>

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.585
<i>-Oh, come on!
-Jackie, think about it</i>

01:26:08.626 --> 01:26:10.920
<i>We got them surrounded</i>

01:26:11.004 --> 01:26:13.048
<i>And here's where I think
Joe's a jerk</i>

01:26:13.089 --> 01:26:14.674
<i>-He's a rattlesnake
-You're right</i>

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:16.301
<i>And you know why
a snake starts to rattle?</i>

01:26:16.384 --> 01:26:17.510
<i>-No. Why?
-'Cause he's scared</i>

01:26:17.594 --> 01:26:19.179
<i>-Oh, sure
-Go and look it up</i>

01:26:19.262 --> 01:26:22.140
<i>The poor guy's head
is spinning</i>

01:26:22.223 --> 01:26:24.934
<i>Why would he send for the goons?
An entire army?</i>

01:26:25.018 --> 01:26:26.478
<i>Dozens of goons
plus the cops and...</i>

01:26:26.561 --> 01:26:28.480
<i>-You know, you may be right
-Thank you, God</i>

01:26:28.563 --> 01:26:30.857
<i>-If he wasn't afraid
-Exactly</i>

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.942
<i>He knows we're winning</i>

01:26:32.984 --> 01:26:35.362
<i>Get those kids to see</i>

01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:37.947
<i>We're circling victory</i>

01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:41.951
<i>And watch what happens</i>

01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:46.164
<i>We're doing something
no one's even tried</i>

01:26:46.247 --> 01:26:48.833
<i>And, yes, we're terrified</i>

01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:52.128
<i>But watch what happens</i>

01:26:52.962 --> 01:26:55.173
<i>You can't undo the past</i>

01:26:55.256 --> 01:26:57.217
<i>So just move on</i>

01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.968
<i>And stay on track</i>

01:26:59.010 --> 01:27:00.136
<i>Stay on track</i>

01:27:00.178 --> 01:27:04.641
<i>'Cause Humpty Dumpty
is about to crack</i>

01:27:04.724 --> 01:27:05.725
<i>We've got faith</i>

01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:08.186
<i>We've got the plan</i>

01:27:08.311 --> 01:27:10.271
<i>And we've got Jack</i>

01:27:10.313 --> 01:27:15.151
<i>So just watch what happens</i>

01:27:15.735 --> 01:27:19.989
<i>We're back</i>

01:27:20.198 --> 01:27:21.700
And I've got a date!

01:27:43.847 --> 01:27:46.975
But I've read
your editorials, Mr. Pulitzer.

01:27:47.017 --> 01:27:49.519
How can you express so much
sympathy for the trolley workers

01:27:49.561 --> 01:27:51.312
and yet have none for the newsies?

01:27:51.604 --> 01:27:55.025
Because the trolley workers
are striking for a fair contract.

01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:58.445
The newsies are striking against me.

01:27:59.154 --> 01:28:01.698
I'd spare you this embarrassment
if I could.

01:28:01.781 --> 01:28:04.534
But the Burlesque House
is private property.

01:28:04.617 --> 01:28:07.871
He can't order a raid
without legal cause.

01:28:07.912 --> 01:28:10.206
Mr. Mayor, would the fact that this rally

01:28:10.248 --> 01:28:12.542
is organized by an escaped convict

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:14.044
be cause enough to shut it down?

01:28:14.127 --> 01:28:15.712
An escaped convict?

01:28:15.754 --> 01:28:19.466
A fugitive
from one of your own institutions.

01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:21.634
A convicted thief at large,

01:28:21.718 --> 01:28:24.429
wreaking mischief
on our law-abiding community.

01:28:24.512 --> 01:28:25.930
Mr. Snyder, which one is he?

01:28:26.014 --> 01:28:29.184
That is him, there.

01:28:30.226 --> 01:28:32.395
-Jack Kelly.
-And how do you know this boy?

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:33.855
His is not a pleasant story.

01:28:34.397 --> 01:28:38.443
He was first sentenced to my Refuge
for loitering and vagrancy.

01:28:38.735 --> 01:28:41.571
But his total disregard for authority

01:28:41.613 --> 01:28:43.448
has made him a frequent visitor.

01:28:43.531 --> 01:28:45.909
You called him a thief
and escaped convict.

01:28:46.242 --> 01:28:47.494
After his release,

01:28:47.577 --> 01:28:50.914
I caught him myself, red-handed,

01:28:50.955 --> 01:28:53.416
trafficking stolen food and clothing.

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.335
He was last sentenced to six months,

01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:57.253
but the willful ruffian escaped.

01:28:57.295 --> 01:28:59.297
So you'd be doing the city a service.

01:28:59.756 --> 01:29:02.384
Removing this criminal from our streets.

01:29:02.425 --> 01:29:06.096
If that's the case,
we can take him in quietly.

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:09.641
What good would quiet do me?

01:29:12.936 --> 01:29:15.689
I want a public example made of him.

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:16.940
Mr. Pulitzer...

01:29:17.232 --> 01:29:19.943
The boy, Jack Kelly, is here.

01:29:20.944 --> 01:29:22.320
-Here?
-Just outside.

01:29:22.404 --> 01:29:23.780
He's asked to see you.

01:29:25.949 --> 01:29:27.992
Ask and ye shall be received.

01:29:28.076 --> 01:29:29.452
Mr. Snyder, if you please.

01:29:33.957 --> 01:29:35.208
Sit.

01:29:38.586 --> 01:29:40.213
Mr. Jack Kelly.

01:29:41.006 --> 01:29:43.049
Hey. Good afternoon, boys.

01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:45.301
And which Jack Kelly is this?

01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:47.637
The charismatic union organizer,

01:29:47.721 --> 01:29:50.557
or the petty thief and escaped convict?

01:29:51.725 --> 01:29:54.227
Which one gives us
more in common, huh?

01:29:55.645 --> 01:29:59.149
Impudence is in bad taste
when crawling for mercy.

01:30:00.483 --> 01:30:01.693
Crawlin'?

01:30:02.819 --> 01:30:04.738
That's a laugh. No.

01:30:04.821 --> 01:30:06.156
No, I just stopped by with an invite.

01:30:06.239 --> 01:30:08.867
No, it seems a few hundred

01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:11.244
of your employees are rallyin'

01:30:11.327 --> 01:30:14.789
to discuss some recent disagreements.

01:30:14.831 --> 01:30:19.836
Now, I thought it only fair to invite you
to state your case direct to the fellas.

01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:22.881
So what do you say, Joe?

01:30:22.964 --> 01:30:24.674
Want I should save you
a spot on the bill?

01:30:24.758 --> 01:30:29.220
You are as shameless and disrespectful
a creature as I was told.

01:30:29.304 --> 01:30:32.891
Did you know what I was doing
when I was your age, boy?

01:30:32.974 --> 01:30:34.225
I was fighting in a war.

01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:36.227
Yeah, how'd that turn out for ya?

01:30:36.311 --> 01:30:38.772
It taught me a lesson
that shaped my life.

01:30:38.855 --> 01:30:40.607
You don't win a war on the battlefield.

01:30:40.690 --> 01:30:43.568
It's the headline that crowns the victor.

01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:45.570
Well, I will keep that in mind

01:30:45.653 --> 01:30:50.742
when New York wakes up
to front page photos of our rally.

01:30:51.368 --> 01:30:53.370
Rally till the cows come home.

01:30:53.411 --> 01:30:55.872
Not a paper in town will publish a word.

01:30:55.955 --> 01:31:00.210
And if it's not in the papers,
it never happened.

01:31:01.378 --> 01:31:03.380
You may run this city,

01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:06.216
but there are some of us
who cannot be bullied.

01:31:06.299 --> 01:31:07.717
Even some reporters.

01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:11.846
Such as that young woman
who made you yesterday's news.

01:31:12.806 --> 01:31:14.724
Talented girl.

01:31:14.766 --> 01:31:17.435
And beautiful as well, don't you think?

01:31:17.519 --> 01:31:19.562
Yeah. I'll tell her you said so.

01:31:19.646 --> 01:31:21.815
No need. She can hear for herself.

01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:23.400
Can't you, darling?

01:31:23.983 --> 01:31:26.736
I trust you know
my daughter, Katherine.

01:31:29.739 --> 01:31:33.076
Yes. My daughter.

01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:36.913
You're probably asking,
why the nom de plume?

01:31:36.955 --> 01:31:39.416
Why doesn't my daughter work for me?

01:31:39.499 --> 01:31:40.542
Good questions.

01:31:40.583 --> 01:31:44.129
I offered Katherine a life
of wealth and leisure.

01:31:44.212 --> 01:31:47.257
Instead, she chose to pursue a career.

01:31:47.298 --> 01:31:48.842
And she was showing real promise

01:31:48.925 --> 01:31:54.764
until this recent lapse.

01:31:55.682 --> 01:31:57.684
But you're done with all of that now,
aren't you, sweetheart?

01:31:57.767 --> 01:31:59.519
-Jack, I didn't mean...
-No.

01:31:59.602 --> 01:32:02.063
Don't trouble the boy
with your problems, dearest.

01:32:02.105 --> 01:32:04.524
Mr. Kelly has a plateful of his own.

01:32:04.607 --> 01:32:06.943
Would you say so, Mr. Snyder?

01:32:07.652 --> 01:32:09.612
Hello, Jack.

01:32:11.948 --> 01:32:14.451
Does anyone else feel
a noose tightening?

01:32:15.952 --> 01:32:18.747
But allow me to offer
an alternate scenario.

01:32:18.788 --> 01:32:20.290
You attend this rally

01:32:20.373 --> 01:32:23.626
and you speak against
this hopeless strike.

01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:27.756
And I'll see your
criminal record expunged.

01:32:27.797 --> 01:32:30.800
And your pockets filled
with enough cash to carry you

01:32:30.842 --> 01:32:34.220
in a first-class train compartment
from New York

01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:36.973
to New Mexico and beyond.

01:32:37.057 --> 01:32:40.143
You did say
he wanted to travel west, didn't you?

01:32:40.685 --> 01:32:44.773
There ain't a person in this room
that don't know you stink.

01:32:46.107 --> 01:32:49.944
And if they know me,
they know I don't care.

01:32:50.737 --> 01:32:52.781
Mark my words, boy.

01:32:52.822 --> 01:32:54.449
Defy me, and I'll have you

01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:57.702
and every one of your friends
locked up in the Refuge.

01:32:57.786 --> 01:32:59.496
Now, I know...

01:32:59.537 --> 01:33:02.040
I know that you are Mr. Tough Guy.

01:33:02.123 --> 01:33:06.503
But it's not right to condemn that little
crippled boy to conditions like that.

01:33:06.836 --> 01:33:09.089
-And what about your pal...
-Davey.

01:33:09.172 --> 01:33:11.800
Davey and his baby brother

01:33:11.841 --> 01:33:14.302
ripped from their loving family

01:33:14.761 --> 01:33:17.681
and tossed to the rats.

01:33:20.558 --> 01:33:23.937
Will they ever be able
to thank you enough?

01:33:25.271 --> 01:33:29.567
<i>Time's running out, kid
So what do you say?</i>

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.236
<i>Cowboy or convict</i>

01:33:31.861 --> 01:33:33.947
<i>I win either way</i>

01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:36.449
<i>Your abject surrender</i>

01:33:36.825 --> 01:33:39.953
<i>Was always the bottom line</i>

01:33:40.036 --> 01:33:43.164
Gentlemen, escort our guest
to the cellar

01:33:43.206 --> 01:33:46.626
so he might reflect in solitude.

01:33:47.252 --> 01:33:49.963
<i>Too bad you've no job, Jack
but you did resign</i>

01:33:50.463 --> 01:33:53.675
<i>Too bad you've no family
but you can't have mine</i>

01:33:53.717 --> 01:33:58.054
<i>Be glad you're alive, boy
I'd say that's the bottom line</i>

01:34:00.598 --> 01:34:02.017
<i>Like the pied piper</i>

01:34:02.058 --> 01:34:03.560
<i>You knew what to play</i>

01:34:03.601 --> 01:34:06.396
<i>Till those kids all
believed you were right</i>

01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:10.400
<i>Lucky for them
all but one got away</i>

01:34:10.525 --> 01:34:14.237
<i>They may not be
so lucky tonight</i>

01:34:14.904 --> 01:34:18.408
And now, we've been given
discretion to handle you as we see fit.

01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:19.617
Yeah, so behave.

01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:21.202
But just in case,

01:34:21.244 --> 01:34:24.414
I been polishin'
my favorite brass knuckles.

01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:29.210
You can sleep right here
on this old printin' press.

01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:34.257
Now that there is firm.

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:49.147
<i>Newsies need our help today
Newsies need our help today</i>

01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:51.149
<i>Tell 'em Brooklyn's

01:34:51.232 --> 01:34:53.109
<i>Tell 'em Brooklyn's

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:57.030
<i>We're from Brooklyn

01:34:57.113 --> 01:35:02.535
<i>We are Brooklyn newsies</i>

<i>Just got word

01:35:07.582 --> 01:35:10.585
<i>Facin' total disaster

<i>That's our cue, boys
it's time to go slummin'</i>

01:35:14.297 --> 01:35:17.801
<i>Hey, Manhattan, the cavalry's comin'</i>

01:35:17.884 --> 01:35:18.927
<i>Have no fear</i>

01:35:18.968 --> 01:35:21.137
<i>You know we've got

01:35:21.179 --> 01:35:22.222
<i>Brooklyn's here</i>

<i>We'll get your pay back
with some payback</i>

01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:27.894
<i>We're the boys

01:35:27.977 --> 01:35:31.231

<i>Borough what gave me birth</i>

01:35:44.869 --> 01:35:47.288
<i>Friendliest place on Earth</i>

<i>Pay us a visit

01:35:51.543 --> 01:35:53.169
<i>-And when ya do

Welcome, newsies of New York City.

01:36:43.470 --> 01:36:48.224
Welcome to my theater
and your revolution!

01:36:48.725 --> 01:36:52.645
And let's hear it
for Spot Conlon and Brooklyn!

01:36:53.605 --> 01:36:56.024
Newsies united!

01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:08.495
Let's see what Pulitzer's
gotta say to you now.

01:37:09.412 --> 01:37:10.705
Hey, Davey.

01:37:10.997 --> 01:37:12.207
Where's Jack?

01:37:13.708 --> 01:37:16.211
Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:37:16.252 --> 01:37:18.588
Sorry, kid. No sign of him yet.

01:37:18.672 --> 01:37:20.215
Looks like you're doin' a solo.

01:37:20.256 --> 01:37:21.257
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

01:37:21.341 --> 01:37:22.342
All right.

01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:25.553
Newsies of New York!

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:31.601
Look at what we done.

01:37:31.685 --> 01:37:36.272
We got newsies from every pape
and every neighborhood here tonight.

01:37:38.191 --> 01:37:40.777
Tonight, you're makin' history.

01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:43.321
Tonight, we declare

01:37:43.405 --> 01:37:46.241
that we are just
as much a part of the newspaper

01:37:46.282 --> 01:37:48.576
as any reporter or editor.

01:37:48.618 --> 01:37:52.414
We are done being treated like kids.

01:37:52.872 --> 01:37:56.126
From now on,
they will treat us as equals!

01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:57.335
All right?

01:37:57.419 --> 01:37:59.045
You wanna be talked to like an adult?

01:37:59.129 --> 01:38:00.422
Start actin' like one.

01:38:00.463 --> 01:38:01.965
-Jack.
-Don't just run your mouth.

01:38:02.007 --> 01:38:04.092
-Make some sense.
-And here's Jack!

01:38:04.843 --> 01:38:06.636
Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:38:06.678 --> 01:38:07.887
All right, all right.

01:38:07.971 --> 01:38:09.222
All right!

01:38:14.227 --> 01:38:15.478
Pulitzer...

01:38:16.438 --> 01:38:19.733
Raised the price of papes
without so much as a word to us

01:38:19.816 --> 01:38:21.234
and that was a lousy thing to do.

01:38:22.027 --> 01:38:23.153
So we got mad

01:38:23.528 --> 01:38:25.488
and we showed 'em
we ain't gonna be pushed around.

01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:27.532
So we go on strike.
And then what happens?

01:38:27.615 --> 01:38:30.493
Well, Pulitzer lowers the price of papes,
so's we'll go back to work!

01:38:34.831 --> 01:38:36.750
And then a few weeks after that,

01:38:37.584 --> 01:38:40.795
he hikes up his price again,
and don't think he won't.

01:38:40.837 --> 01:38:42.464
So what do we do then?

01:38:42.922 --> 01:38:46.343
And what do we do when he decides
to raise his price again after that?

01:38:46.426 --> 01:38:49.012
Fellas, we gotta be realistic here.

01:38:49.095 --> 01:38:51.556
If we don't work, we don't get paid.

01:38:53.141 --> 01:38:56.019
How many days can you go
without making money?

01:38:58.438 --> 01:39:02.942
Believe me, however long,
Pulitzer can go longer.

01:39:04.569 --> 01:39:07.364
But I have spoken with Mr. Pulitzer.

01:39:10.033 --> 01:39:11.534
And he...

01:39:11.576 --> 01:39:13.453
He has given me his word.

01:39:13.912 --> 01:39:15.538
If we disband the union,

01:39:16.289 --> 01:39:19.459
he will not raise prices again
for two years.

01:39:19.542 --> 01:39:20.543
He will even put that in writing.

01:39:20.627 --> 01:39:22.128
Now I say, we take the deal.

01:39:22.212 --> 01:39:25.090
We go back to work
knowing our price is secure.

01:39:25.173 --> 01:39:27.050
All you gotta do is vote "No."

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:28.343
Vote "No"!

01:39:34.265 --> 01:39:35.475
He's a sellout.

01:39:35.558 --> 01:39:37.018
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.520
You're a traitor, Jack!

01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.149
Davey.

01:39:51.825 --> 01:39:53.743
That was some speech you made.

01:39:53.785 --> 01:39:56.037
-How'd you get here?
-Well, Specs showed me.

01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:57.789
What? He say you could
go through my stuff?

01:39:57.872 --> 01:39:59.916
I saw them rolled up
sticking out of there.

01:39:59.958 --> 01:40:01.584
I didn't know what they were.

01:40:02.919 --> 01:40:04.421
These drawings...

01:40:04.504 --> 01:40:07.090
These are drawings
of the Refuge, aren't they?

01:40:07.173 --> 01:40:09.175
Is this really what it's like in there?

01:40:09.551 --> 01:40:13.138
Three boys to a bed,
rats everywhere and vermin...

01:40:13.221 --> 01:40:15.015
What? A little different
from where you were raised?

01:40:17.058 --> 01:40:21.396
Snyder told my father that you were
arrested stealing food and clothing.

01:40:22.355 --> 01:40:24.357
This is why, isn't it?

01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:26.776
You stole to feed those boys.

01:40:28.153 --> 01:40:29.446
I don't understand!

01:40:29.487 --> 01:40:31.865
If you are willing
to go to jail for those boys,

01:40:31.948 --> 01:40:34.242
how could you turn
your back on them now?

01:40:34.284 --> 01:40:37.370
I do not think you are one to talk
about turnin' on folks!

01:40:37.454 --> 01:40:39.372
I never turned on you or anyone else.

01:40:39.456 --> 01:40:40.457
No, you didn't.

01:40:40.498 --> 01:40:42.417
You just double-crossed us
to your father!

01:40:42.459 --> 01:40:43.501
Your father!

01:40:43.585 --> 01:40:46.338
My father has eyes
on every corner of this city.

01:40:46.421 --> 01:40:48.465
He doesn't need me spying for him.

01:40:48.548 --> 01:40:49.841
And I never lied.

01:40:51.176 --> 01:40:52.344
I didn't tell you everything.

01:40:52.844 --> 01:40:53.928
If you weren't a girl,

01:40:53.970 --> 01:40:57.182
you would be trying to talk
with a fist in your mouth.

01:40:57.265 --> 01:40:59.517
I told you that I worked
for <i>The Sun</i> and I did.

01:40:59.601 --> 01:41:01.895
I told you my professional
name is Plumber and it is.

01:41:01.978 --> 01:41:03.313
You never asked my real one.

01:41:03.772 --> 01:41:05.106
I wouldn't think I had to

01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:07.484
unless I knew
I was dealing with a backstabber!

01:41:07.567 --> 01:41:08.818
And if I was a boy,

01:41:08.902 --> 01:41:11.154
you'd be looking at me
through one swollen eye!

01:41:11.237 --> 01:41:12.697
Yeah? Don't let that stop you.

01:41:12.781 --> 01:41:14.324
Give me your best shot!

01:41:27.837 --> 01:41:31.633
I need to know
that you didn't cave for the money.

01:41:35.679 --> 01:41:37.305
No, I spoke the truth.

01:41:37.347 --> 01:41:41.351
You win a fight when you got
the other fellow down eatin' pavement.

01:41:42.477 --> 01:41:43.853
All right, you heard your father.

01:41:43.895 --> 01:41:45.355
No matter how many days we strike,

01:41:45.438 --> 01:41:47.107
he ain't never givin' up. I don't...

01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:48.983
I don't know what else we can do.

01:41:49.025 --> 01:41:51.027
-But I do.
-Come on.

01:41:51.069 --> 01:41:52.696
Really, Jack, really?

01:41:52.737 --> 01:41:54.489
Only you can have a good idea?

01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:56.408
-Or is it because I'm a girl?
-I did not say nothin'...

01:41:56.491 --> 01:41:58.660
This would be a good time to shut up.

01:42:03.206 --> 01:42:05.709
Being boss doesn't mean
you have all the answers.

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:09.629
Just the brains to recognize
the right one when you hear it.

01:42:11.464 --> 01:42:12.549
I'm listening.

01:42:12.632 --> 01:42:14.009
Good for you.

01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:17.178
The strike was your idea.
The rally was Davey's.

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:20.223
And now my plan
will take us to the finish line.

01:42:20.306 --> 01:42:21.683
Deal with it.

01:42:23.727 --> 01:42:25.854
"The Children's Crusade."

01:42:25.895 --> 01:42:29.566
"For the sake of all the kids
in every sweatshop, factory

01:42:29.649 --> 01:42:31.901
"and slaughterhouse in New York,

01:42:31.943 --> 01:42:33.653
"I beg you, join us."

01:42:33.737 --> 01:42:34.738
This...

01:42:34.779 --> 01:42:38.575
With those words, the strike stopped
being just about the newsies.

01:42:38.616 --> 01:42:40.910
You challenged our whole generation

01:42:40.952 --> 01:42:43.830
to stand up
and demand a place at the table.

01:42:44.539 --> 01:42:45.915
Children's Crusade...

01:42:45.999 --> 01:42:48.293
Think, Jack, if we publish this,

01:42:48.376 --> 01:42:50.920
my words with one of your drawings,

01:42:51.004 --> 01:42:53.089
and if every worker under 21

01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:55.258
read it and stayed home from work,

01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.593
or better yet,

01:42:56.634 --> 01:42:57.927
they came to Newsie Square.

01:42:57.969 --> 01:43:00.430
A general citywide strike!

01:43:00.472 --> 01:43:02.891
Even my father couldn't ignore that.

01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:06.770
We have one small problem.

01:43:07.604 --> 01:43:09.189
We got no way to print it.

01:43:09.272 --> 01:43:12.942
Come on, there has to be
one printing press he doesn't control.

01:43:16.112 --> 01:43:18.198
-No.
-What?

01:43:20.283 --> 01:43:22.202
I know where there's a printing press

01:43:22.285 --> 01:43:24.329
no one would ever think we'd use.

01:43:24.412 --> 01:43:25.830
Well, then, why are
we still standing here?

01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:28.375
Hey, hey. Wait! Stop!

01:43:30.835 --> 01:43:33.254
What is this about for you?

01:43:33.296 --> 01:43:35.757
Nah, and I'm not talkin' about
the Children's Crusade.

01:43:35.799 --> 01:43:37.217
What's this about?

01:43:38.343 --> 01:43:39.844
What, am I...

01:43:39.928 --> 01:43:43.181
Am I kiddin' myself
or is there somethin'...

01:43:44.349 --> 01:43:45.892
Of course, there is.

01:43:46.935 --> 01:43:48.978
Well, don't just say it
like it happens every day!

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:52.273
-Jack, I didn't...
-No, no! I'm not an idiot!

01:43:52.315 --> 01:43:55.360
Look, I know girls like you
don't wind up with guys like me.

01:43:55.443 --> 01:43:58.822
And I don't want you promisin' nothin'
you're just gonna take back later.

01:44:06.413 --> 01:44:07.664
Standin' here...

01:44:09.249 --> 01:44:11.334
Tonight, lookin' at you, I...

01:44:14.004 --> 01:44:17.966
Look, I'm scared tomorrow's gonna
come and change everything.

01:44:21.886 --> 01:44:25.724
If there was a way
I could grab hold of somethin'...

01:44:26.891 --> 01:44:30.937
Just to make time stop,
so's I could just

01:44:32.147 --> 01:44:34.107
keep on lookin' at you.

01:44:35.066 --> 01:44:37.444
You snuck up on me, Jack Kelly.

01:44:38.528 --> 01:44:40.697
I never even saw it coming.

01:44:41.531 --> 01:44:42.866
For sure?

01:44:43.158 --> 01:44:44.367
For sure.

01:44:45.118 --> 01:44:48.121
<i>Till the moment I found you</i>

01:44:48.204 --> 01:44:51.541
<i>I thought I knew what love was</i>

01:44:52.125 --> 01:44:55.462
<i>Now I'm learning what is true</i>

01:44:55.545 --> 01:44:59.007
<i>That love will do what it does</i>

01:44:59.049 --> 01:45:02.469
<i>The world finds ways to sting you</i>

01:45:02.552 --> 01:45:06.264
<i>And then, one day
decides to bring you</i>

01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:09.392
<i>Something to believe in</i>

01:45:09.434 --> 01:45:13.063
<i>For even a night</i>

01:45:13.146 --> 01:45:16.483
<i>One night may be forever</i>

01:45:16.566 --> 01:45:18.234
<i>But that's all right</i>

01:45:18.318 --> 01:45:19.903
<i>That's all right</i>

01:45:19.986 --> 01:45:23.073
<i>And if you're gone tomorrow</i>

01:45:23.114 --> 01:45:26.993
<i>What was ours still will be</i>

01:45:27.077 --> 01:45:30.205
<i>I have something to believe in</i>

01:45:30.246 --> 01:45:36.294
<i>Now that I know you believed in me</i>

01:45:40.965 --> 01:45:43.426
<i>We was never meant to meet</i>

01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:45.595
<i>And then we meet</i>

01:45:45.637 --> 01:45:47.097
<i>Who knows why</i>

01:45:47.889 --> 01:45:50.684
<i>One more stranger on the street</i>

01:45:50.767 --> 01:45:54.020
<i>Just someone sweet passing by</i>

01:45:54.688 --> 01:45:58.108
<i>An angel come to save me</i>

01:45:58.149 --> 01:46:01.611
<i>Who didn't even know she gave me</i>

01:46:01.653 --> 01:46:04.739
<i>Somethin' to believe in</i>

01:46:04.781 --> 01:46:07.784
<i>For even a day</i>

01:46:08.702 --> 01:46:11.955
<i>One day may be forever</i>

01:46:11.996 --> 01:46:13.790
<i>But that's okay</i>

01:46:13.832 --> 01:46:15.625
<i>That's okay</i>

01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:18.712
<i>And if I'm gone tomorrow</i>

01:46:18.795 --> 01:46:21.923
<i>What was ours still will be</i>

01:46:22.757 --> 01:46:26.136
<i>I have something to believe in</i>

01:46:26.219 --> 01:46:32.892
<i>Now that I know you believed in me</i>

01:46:36.896 --> 01:46:40.275
<i>Do you know what I believe in?</i>

01:46:40.316 --> 01:46:43.486
<i>Look into my eyes</i>

01:46:43.528 --> 01:46:47.407
<i>And see</i>

01:46:54.664 --> 01:46:57.208
If things were different...

01:46:57.292 --> 01:47:00.128
If you weren't going to Santa Fe...

01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:02.047
Yeah, if you weren't an heiress...

01:47:02.672 --> 01:47:05.175
And if your father wasn't after my head.

01:47:05.258 --> 01:47:06.968
But you're not really
scared of my father.

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:08.845
No.

01:47:08.928 --> 01:47:10.889
I am pretty scared of you.

01:47:10.972 --> 01:47:12.724
Don't be!

01:47:13.308 --> 01:47:16.311
<i>And if I'm gone tomorrow</i>

01:47:16.353 --> 01:47:20.065
<i>What was ours still will be</i>

01:47:20.148 --> 01:47:23.485
<i>I have something to believe in</i>

01:47:23.526 --> 01:47:30.200
<i>Now that I know you believed in me</i>

01:47:33.411 --> 01:47:36.748
<i>I have somethin' to believe in</i>

01:47:36.831 --> 01:47:41.753
<i>Now that I know you believed</i>

01:47:41.836 --> 01:47:48.635
<i>In me</i>

01:48:06.903 --> 01:48:11.199
<i>Now is the time to seize the day</i>

01:48:11.241 --> 01:48:15.578
<i>Stare down the odds and seize the day</i>

01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:19.749
<i>Minute by minute, that's how you win it</i>

01:48:19.833 --> 01:48:23.586
<i>We will find a way</i>

01:48:23.628 --> 01:48:27.340
<i>But let us seize the day</i>

01:48:27.424 --> 01:48:29.884
I'll get the lights.
You get those windows unlocked.

01:48:29.926 --> 01:48:32.429
We've got enough keys
here for the entire building.

01:48:32.512 --> 01:48:34.389
Hey, has someone being
pickin' Daddy's pockets?

01:48:34.431 --> 01:48:36.933
The janitor's been working here
since he was eight

01:48:36.975 --> 01:48:39.686
and hasn't had a raise in 20 years.

01:48:39.769 --> 01:48:41.730
He's with us 100%.

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:46.067
Hey, you bring enough
fellas to keep us covered?

01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:48.236
We can hold a hoedown in here
and no one would be the wiser.

01:48:48.278 --> 01:48:49.738
All right, good job.

01:48:50.363 --> 01:48:51.614
Hey.

01:48:52.949 --> 01:48:54.909
It's good to have you back again.

01:48:54.951 --> 01:48:56.161
Shut up.

01:48:56.661 --> 01:48:58.371
Here she is, boys.

01:48:58.455 --> 01:49:02.292
Now just think, while my father
snores blissfully in his bed,

01:49:02.334 --> 01:49:06.004
we will be using his very own press
to bring him down.

01:49:06.087 --> 01:49:08.340
Yeah, remind me
to stay on your good side.

01:49:08.965 --> 01:49:10.550
Hey, is this what they print
the papes on?

01:49:10.633 --> 01:49:13.553
I can see why they tossed
this old girl down to the cellar.

01:49:13.636 --> 01:49:15.472
But I think she'll do the job.

01:49:15.597 --> 01:49:17.140
Jack, this is Darcy.

01:49:17.223 --> 01:49:20.310
He knows just about everything
there is to know about printing.

01:49:21.311 --> 01:49:22.562
I'm sorry.

01:49:23.772 --> 01:49:25.148
You work for one of the papes?

01:49:25.231 --> 01:49:26.900
My father owns <i>The Trib.</i>

01:49:27.776 --> 01:49:28.943
Whoa. Whoa!

01:49:28.985 --> 01:49:32.280
And this is Bill.
He'll be typesetting the article for us.

01:49:33.031 --> 01:49:36.326
Bill? So I suppose you're the son
of William Randolph Hearst, right?

01:49:36.409 --> 01:49:38.828
Yeah. And proud to be
a part of your revolution.

01:49:38.912 --> 01:49:40.163
Ain't that somethin'?

01:49:40.246 --> 01:49:41.664
In the words of the little one,

01:49:41.706 --> 01:49:44.709
"Can we table the palaver
and get back to business?"

01:49:44.793 --> 01:49:46.753
A little grease,
and she'll be good as gold.

01:49:47.253 --> 01:49:48.797
All right, here's how it'll work.

01:49:48.838 --> 01:49:51.716
As we print the papes, Race,
you'll let the fellas in

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:54.803
and they'll spread 'em
to every workin' kid in New York.

01:49:55.679 --> 01:49:57.681
-After that...
-Well, after that,

01:49:57.764 --> 01:49:59.140
it's up to them.

01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:06.690
<i>There's change comin'</i>

01:50:06.773 --> 01:50:09.526
<i>Once and for all</i>

01:50:09.567 --> 01:50:12.529
<i>You makes the front page</i>

01:50:12.612 --> 01:50:16.825
<i>And, man, you is major news</i>

01:50:16.866 --> 01:50:21.830
<i>Tomorrow they'll see what we are</i>

01:50:21.871 --> 01:50:24.958
<i>And sure as a star</i>

01:50:25.041 --> 01:50:30.880
<i>We ain't come this far</i>

01:50:30.964 --> 01:50:32.549
<i>To lose</i>

01:50:32.590 --> 01:50:34.676
-Let's go, boys! Clear up!
-Here they come!

01:50:34.718 --> 01:50:35.802
Right, bring 'em in!

01:50:35.885 --> 01:50:37.679
-Let's go, boys!
-Come on, boys, let's go!

01:50:37.721 --> 01:50:40.306
<i>This is the story we needed to write</i>

01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:42.851
<i>As we're kept out of sight, but no more</i>

01:50:43.435 --> 01:50:45.770
<i>In a few hours, by dawn's early light</i>

01:50:45.854 --> 01:50:48.064
<i>We'll be ready to fight us a war</i>

01:50:49.190 --> 01:50:51.401
<i>This time, we're in it to stay</i>

01:50:52.027 --> 01:50:53.945
<i>Talk about seizing the day</i>

01:50:54.904 --> 01:50:56.656
<i>Write it in ink or in blood</i>

01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.742
<i>It's the same either way</i>

01:50:59.284 --> 01:51:00.994
<i>They're gonna damn well pay!</i>

01:51:01.077 --> 01:51:03.163
<i>See old man Pulitzer snug in his bed</i>

01:51:03.246 --> 01:51:05.874
<i>He don't care if we're dead or alive</i>

01:51:06.374 --> 01:51:09.127
<i>Three satin pillows are under his head</i>

01:51:09.210 --> 01:51:11.588
<i>While we's begging
for bread to survive</i>

01:51:12.213 --> 01:51:13.923
<i>Joe, you can stop counting sheep</i>

01:51:15.091 --> 01:51:17.427
<i>We're gonna sing ya to sleep</i>

01:51:17.886 --> 01:51:20.013
<i>You've got your thugs
with their sticks and their slugs</i>

01:51:20.096 --> 01:51:23.475
<i>Yeah!
But we got a promise to keep!</i>

01:51:23.558 --> 01:51:26.311
<i>Once and for all
if they don't mind their manners</i>

01:51:26.394 --> 01:51:28.146
<i>We'll bleed 'em</i>

01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:29.689
<i>Bleed 'em</i>

01:51:29.773 --> 01:51:32.275
<i>Once and for all
we won't carry no banners</i>

01:51:32.317 --> 01:51:33.943
<i>That don't spell</i>

01:51:33.985 --> 01:51:35.445
<i>Freedom!</i>

01:51:35.528 --> 01:51:37.614
<i>Finally, we's raising the stakes</i>

01:51:38.406 --> 01:51:40.450
<i>This time, whatever it takes</i>

01:51:41.326 --> 01:51:43.495
<i>This time, the union awaits</i>

01:51:43.578 --> 01:51:46.456
<i>Once and for all!</i>

01:51:46.498 --> 01:51:49.209
"In the words of union leader,
Jack Kelly..."

01:51:50.377 --> 01:51:53.213
"'We will work with you,
we will even work for you,

01:51:53.296 --> 01:51:54.547
"'but we will be paid

01:51:54.631 --> 01:51:57.884
"'and treated as valuable members
of your organization.'"

01:51:59.969 --> 01:52:01.304
Riveting stuff, huh?

01:52:01.346 --> 01:52:03.515
Hey, get goin'.
You got a very important man to see.

01:52:03.598 --> 01:52:05.684
Well, keep your fingers crossed, okay?

01:52:05.767 --> 01:52:07.310
For us, too.

01:52:08.812 --> 01:52:11.022
<i>This is for kids
shining shoes on the street</i>

01:52:11.106 --> 01:52:13.650
<i>With no shoes on their feet every day</i>

01:52:14.401 --> 01:52:17.112
<i>This is for guys
sweating blood in the shops</i>

01:52:17.153 --> 01:52:20.115
<i>While their bosses and cops look away</i>

01:52:20.156 --> 01:52:22.909
<i>I'm seeing kids standing tall</i>

01:52:22.992 --> 01:52:25.870
<i>Glaring and raring to brawl</i>

01:52:25.954 --> 01:52:28.164
<i>Armies of guys who are sick of the lies</i>

01:52:28.248 --> 01:52:31.793
<i>Getting ready to rise to the call!</i>

01:52:31.835 --> 01:52:34.170
<i>Once and for all
there'll be blood on the wall</i>

01:52:34.212 --> 01:52:37.424
<i>If they doubt us</i>

01:52:37.507 --> 01:52:39.175
<i>They think they're running this town</i>

01:52:39.217 --> 01:52:43.346
<i>But this town will shut down without us</i>

01:52:43.388 --> 01:52:45.181
<i>Ten thousand kids in the square</i>

01:52:45.265 --> 01:52:46.516
<i>Ten thousand kids in the square</i>

01:52:46.599 --> 01:52:49.227
<i>-Ten thousand fists in the air
-Ten thousand fists</i>

01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:51.354
<i>Joe, you is gonna play fair</i>

01:52:51.396 --> 01:52:53.732
<i>Once and for all!</i>

01:52:59.654 --> 01:53:05.535
<i>-Once and for all

<i>-Once and for all
-Once and for all</i>

01:53:11.041 --> 01:53:17.672
<i>-Once and for all

01:53:17.714 --> 01:53:22.552
<i>There's change coming
once and for all</i>

01:53:22.635 --> 01:53:25.555
<i>You're getting too old</i>

01:53:25.638 --> 01:53:29.601
<i>Too weak to keep holding on</i>

01:53:29.684 --> 01:53:34.564
<i>A new world is gunning for you</i>

01:53:34.606 --> 01:53:37.233
<i>And, Joe, we is, too!</i>

01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:42.405
<i>Till once and for all</i>

01:53:42.447 --> 01:53:44.824
<i>You're gone!</i>

01:53:46.368 --> 01:53:47.577
Come on, boys!

01:53:49.579 --> 01:53:52.582
<i>Once and for all</i>

01:53:52.624 --> 01:53:54.959

<i>Once and for all</i>

01:53:58.755 --> 01:54:05.470
<i>Once and for all</i>

01:54:36.042 --> 01:54:38.712
I'm sorry, Mr. Pulitzer
will have to call you back.

01:54:38.795 --> 01:54:40.880
No, he's very busy.
He'll have to call you back. I'm sorry.

01:54:40.964 --> 01:54:42.799
He can't talk. He'll call you back.

01:54:42.841 --> 01:54:45.635
Mr. Pulitzer's office.
No, he can't take your call. I'm sorry.

01:54:45.677 --> 01:54:47.971
I'm sorry,
Mr. Pulitzer's simply not available.

01:54:48.013 --> 01:54:49.222
Well, I'm sorry! I am...

01:54:49.431 --> 01:54:50.598
Silence those phones!

01:54:51.349 --> 01:54:53.268
The entire city is...

01:54:54.436 --> 01:54:55.437
Sorry.

01:54:56.271 --> 01:54:58.523
The entire city is shut down.

01:54:58.606 --> 01:55:00.984
No one is working anywhere,
and everyone is blaming you!

01:55:01.026 --> 01:55:02.485
They're all calling.

01:55:02.527 --> 01:55:05.655
The mayor, the publishers,
the manufacturers.

01:55:06.698 --> 01:55:08.491
And such language.

01:55:09.242 --> 01:55:10.827
You can't just barge in here!

01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:12.537
Mornin', gents!

01:55:13.163 --> 01:55:14.247
You're behind this.

01:55:14.622 --> 01:55:15.665
We had a deal.

01:55:17.292 --> 01:55:20.086
And it came
with a money-back guarantee.

01:55:20.879 --> 01:55:24.966
And thank you for your lesson
on the powers of the press.

01:55:25.842 --> 01:55:27.802
Did you read this, boss?

01:55:30.513 --> 01:55:32.223
These kids put out a pretty good paper.

01:55:33.433 --> 01:55:34.726
Very convincing.

01:55:34.851 --> 01:55:36.061
No doubt written by my daughter.

01:55:37.145 --> 01:55:39.522
I would sign her
before somebody else grabs her.

01:55:40.648 --> 01:55:44.361
I demand to know who defied
my ban on printing strike material.

01:55:45.528 --> 01:55:47.238
No, we're your loyal employees.

01:55:47.739 --> 01:55:50.200
We would never take
our business elsewhere.

01:55:51.242 --> 01:55:53.370
That old printing press in the cellar.

01:55:57.582 --> 01:56:00.085
I made you the offer of a lifetime.

01:56:00.168 --> 01:56:03.546
Anyone who does not act
in his own self-interest is a fool.

01:56:03.588 --> 01:56:04.839
What's that make you?

01:56:07.342 --> 01:56:09.886
This all began because
you wanted to sell more papers.

01:56:11.179 --> 01:56:13.598
But now your circulation is down 70%.

01:56:15.809 --> 01:56:17.519
Why didn't you just come talk to us?

01:56:17.894 --> 01:56:21.523
'Cause guys like Joe
don't talk to nobodies like us.

01:56:22.232 --> 01:56:24.651
But a very wise reporter told me,

01:56:24.734 --> 01:56:28.405
"A real boss don't need
all the answers." Nah.

01:56:28.446 --> 01:56:32.784
"Just the smarts enough to snatch up
the right one when he hears it."

01:56:33.743 --> 01:56:37.914
<i>Now is the time to seize the day</i>

01:56:37.956 --> 01:56:42.627
<i>Stare down the odds and seize the day</i>

01:56:42.711 --> 01:56:47.465
<i>Minute by minute, that's how you win it</i>

01:56:47.549 --> 01:56:50.927
<i>We will find a way</i>

01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.557
<i>But let us seize the day</i>

01:56:55.598 --> 01:56:58.101
Have a look out there, Mr. Pulitzer.

01:56:58.143 --> 01:57:01.021
In case you ain't figured it out,
we got you surrounded.

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.112
New York is closed for business.

01:57:09.154 --> 01:57:10.155
Paralyzed.

01:57:10.238 --> 01:57:12.699
You can't get a paper or a shoe shine.

01:57:12.782 --> 01:57:14.409
You can't send a message,

01:57:14.451 --> 01:57:16.828
ride an elevator
or cross the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:57:16.911 --> 01:57:19.539
Hell, you can't even
get out of your own office.

01:57:20.498 --> 01:57:22.375
So, what's your next move?

01:57:22.459 --> 01:57:25.211
Mr. Pulitzer, the mayor is here
along with your daughter.

01:57:25.295 --> 01:57:27.422
And you won't believe who else.

01:57:27.464 --> 01:57:30.800
Good morning, Mr. Pulitzer.
I think you know the governor.

01:57:31.384 --> 01:57:32.719
Governor Roosevelt?

01:57:33.386 --> 01:57:37.932
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph.
What have you done now?

01:57:38.433 --> 01:57:40.560
I'm certain when you hear
my explanation, you'll know exactly...

01:57:40.643 --> 01:57:43.021
Thanks to Miss Medda Larkin
bringing your daughter to my office,

01:57:43.104 --> 01:57:46.649
I already have a thorough grasp
of the situation.

01:57:46.691 --> 01:57:50.111
Graphic illustrations included.

01:57:50.153 --> 01:57:53.823
"Bully" is the expression
I usually employ to show approval.

01:57:53.907 --> 01:57:56.618
But in your case, I simply mean...

01:57:57.285 --> 01:57:58.411
Bully.

01:57:59.371 --> 01:58:03.083
And is this the boy
of whom you spoke?

01:58:03.166 --> 01:58:04.542
How are you, son?

01:58:04.626 --> 01:58:07.295
I'm told we once shared a carriage ride!

01:58:09.923 --> 01:58:12.342
The pleasure is mine, Mr. Governor.

01:58:15.553 --> 01:58:16.638
My, God...

01:58:17.972 --> 01:58:21.768
Well, Joe, don't just stand there,
letting those children sing...

01:58:23.978 --> 01:58:26.856
Endlessly. Give 'em the good news.

01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:28.233
What good news?

01:58:28.316 --> 01:58:30.860
That you've come to your senses
and rolled back prices.

01:58:30.902 --> 01:58:34.114
Unless, of course, you want to invite
a full state Senate investigation

01:58:34.197 --> 01:58:35.699
into your employment practices.

01:58:35.782 --> 01:58:36.991
You wouldn't dare.

01:58:37.033 --> 01:58:40.745
After the pressure you wielded
to keep me from office...

01:58:42.706 --> 01:58:44.374
I'd do it with a smile.

01:58:46.209 --> 01:58:49.963
Come along, Joseph, there's only
one thing worse than a hard heart.

01:58:51.047 --> 01:58:52.716
And that's a soft head.

01:58:53.508 --> 01:58:56.511
And think of the happiness
you'll bring those children.

01:58:59.556 --> 01:59:01.516
He doesn't do happiness, does he?

01:59:03.226 --> 01:59:04.853
Mr. Kelly...

01:59:06.938 --> 01:59:09.399
If I may speak to you. Alone.

01:59:11.693 --> 01:59:13.069
Don't worry. I'll get it.

01:59:18.158 --> 01:59:22.620
"Keep your eyes on the stars,
and your feet on the ground."

01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.373
You can do this.

01:59:32.547 --> 01:59:35.091
I cannot put the price back where it was.

01:59:35.175 --> 01:59:37.052
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:59:37.093 --> 01:59:39.054
-There are other considerations...
-I get it. I get it.

01:59:39.095 --> 01:59:42.807
Joe, you need to save face
in front of all these other folks.

01:59:42.891 --> 01:59:45.518
-I'm young. I ain't stupid.
-Thank you for understanding...

01:59:45.602 --> 01:59:48.438
But I got constituents
with a legitimate gripe!

01:59:48.521 --> 01:59:50.607
What if I reduced the raise by half?

01:59:51.274 --> 01:59:53.401
And get the others to do the same.

01:59:53.443 --> 01:59:55.987
It's a compromise we can all live with!

01:59:57.364 --> 02:00:01.493
But you eat our losses.

02:00:02.452 --> 02:00:06.623
From now on, any pape we can't sell,
you buy back. Full price!

02:00:06.664 --> 02:00:07.916
That was never on the table!

02:00:07.957 --> 02:00:11.169
What's to stop the newsies from taking
hundreds of papers they cannot sell?

02:00:11.252 --> 02:00:12.462
My cost would explode!

02:00:12.504 --> 02:00:16.800
No newsie's gonna break his back
hauling around papes he can't sell!

02:00:17.258 --> 02:00:19.636
But if he can take a few extra
with no risk,

02:00:19.678 --> 02:00:24.140
he might sell them and then
your circulation will begin to grow!

02:00:26.393 --> 02:00:29.396
"It's a compromise we can all live with!"

02:00:34.150 --> 02:00:36.820
That's not a bad head
you've got on your shoulders.

02:00:42.951 --> 02:00:44.077
Deal?

02:00:48.331 --> 02:00:49.833
That's disgusting.

02:00:50.667 --> 02:00:53.920
Well, that's just the price
of doing business.

02:00:58.842 --> 02:01:00.844
<i>And The World will know</i>

02:01:00.927 --> 02:01:02.929
<i>We been keepin' score</i>

02:01:03.013 --> 02:01:04.431
<i>Either they gives us our rights</i>

02:01:04.514 --> 02:01:07.017
<i>Or we gives them a war</i>

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:11.104
<i>We've been down too long
and we paid our dues</i>

02:01:11.438 --> 02:01:15.108
<i>And the things we do today
will be tomorrow's news</i>

02:01:15.567 --> 02:01:19.654
<i>And the die is cast
and the torch is passed</i>

02:01:19.696 --> 02:01:22.073
<i>-And the roar will rise
-From the streets below</i>

02:01:22.157 --> 02:01:24.325
<i>And our ranks will grow and grow</i>

02:01:24.367 --> 02:01:26.703
<i>And grow and grow
and grow and grow and...</i>

02:01:26.745 --> 02:01:29.080
Newsies of New York City.

02:01:30.206 --> 02:01:31.291
We won!

02:01:35.587 --> 02:01:39.799
And now I would like to introduce
my very own personal pal,

02:01:39.883 --> 02:01:43.053
Governor Theodore Roosevelt himself!

02:01:46.431 --> 02:01:49.601
Each generation must,
at the height of its power,

02:01:49.684 --> 02:01:52.437
step aside and invite the young
to share the day.

02:01:52.896 --> 02:01:55.899
You have laid claim to our world
and I believe the future,

02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:59.611
in your hands,
will be bright and prosperous!

02:02:04.074 --> 02:02:07.077
Your drawing, son,
brought another matter to bear.

02:02:07.410 --> 02:02:09.412
Officers! If you please.

02:02:13.041 --> 02:02:15.418
Hey, Jack, look. It's Crutchie!

02:02:16.544 --> 02:02:18.380
Hiya, fellas! You miss me?

02:02:18.421 --> 02:02:19.464
Yeah!

02:02:20.590 --> 02:02:24.928
And look what I got for youse, a gift.
Straight from the Refuge.

02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:26.388
All right, bring him in, fellas.

02:02:27.847 --> 02:02:29.557
It's Snyder the Spider.

02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:31.559
He ain't lookin' so tough no more.

02:02:33.061 --> 02:02:35.105
Jack, with those drawings,
you've made an eloquent argument

02:02:35.188 --> 02:02:36.940
for shutting down the Refuge.

02:02:36.981 --> 02:02:41.069
Be assured that Mr. Snyder's abuses
will be fully investigated.

02:02:42.028 --> 02:02:43.321
Officers, take him away!

02:02:43.405 --> 02:02:45.907
Please, Your Highness,
may I do the honors?

02:02:47.826 --> 02:02:50.203
You have got to be joking.

02:02:50.286 --> 02:02:54.249
Yeah, and you'll be laughin'
all the way to the pen, little man.

02:02:55.083 --> 02:02:56.543
So long,

02:02:57.252 --> 02:02:58.503
sucker!

02:02:58.586 --> 02:03:00.005
Thank you, Governor.

02:03:00.088 --> 02:03:02.716
I can't help thinking,
if one of your drawings

02:03:02.799 --> 02:03:05.969
convinced the governor
to shut down the Refuge,

02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:09.973
what might a daily political cartoon do
to expose the dealings

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:13.143
in our own government's back rooms?

02:03:14.894 --> 02:03:16.479
What do you say, Teddy?

02:03:16.521 --> 02:03:18.148
Care to let this young man's artistry

02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:20.483
shine a lantern
behind your closed doors?

02:03:20.525 --> 02:03:22.485
Don't sweat it, Gov.

02:03:23.486 --> 02:03:25.155
I mean, with the strike settled,

02:03:25.238 --> 02:03:26.865
I should be hittin' the road.

02:03:27.741 --> 02:03:31.161
Don't you ever get tired
of singing the same old tune?

02:03:31.244 --> 02:03:33.830
What's Santa Fe got
that New York ain't?

02:03:33.872 --> 02:03:35.665
Tarantulas?

02:03:35.707 --> 02:03:39.627
Better yet, what's New York got
that Santa Fe ain't?

02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:42.797
New York's got us, and we're family.

02:03:43.965 --> 02:03:46.551
Did I not hear something
about the strike being settled?

02:03:46.634 --> 02:03:48.762
Papes for the newsies. Line up, boys.

02:03:48.845 --> 02:03:50.889
These papes
ain't gonna sell themselves.

02:03:50.972 --> 02:03:52.223
Come along, Governor.

02:03:52.307 --> 02:03:56.102
And show me that backseat
I've been hearing so much about.

02:03:58.521 --> 02:04:01.691
Well, don't just stand there.
You've got a union to run.

02:04:02.275 --> 02:04:06.863
Besides, didn't someone just offer
you a pretty exciting job?

02:04:06.905 --> 02:04:08.698
What? Me work for your father?

02:04:08.782 --> 02:04:10.867
Well, you already work for my father.

02:04:11.785 --> 02:04:12.952
Yeah.

02:04:13.745 --> 02:04:16.581
And you've got
one more ace up your sleeve.

02:04:16.873 --> 02:04:18.416
And what would that be?

02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:19.626
Me.

02:04:20.168 --> 02:04:22.545
Wherever you go, I'm there.

02:04:23.546 --> 02:04:25.215
Right by your side.

02:04:25.882 --> 02:04:27.050
For sure?

02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:28.885
For sure.

02:04:31.388 --> 02:04:35.684
<i>It don't take much to be a dreamer</i>

02:04:35.725 --> 02:04:38.561
<i>All you do is close your eyes</i>

02:04:39.479 --> 02:04:44.442
<i>But some made-up world
is all you ever see</i>

02:04:47.404 --> 02:04:50.740
<i>Now my eyes is finally open</i>

02:04:50.782 --> 02:04:54.035
<i>And my dreams, they's average size</i>

02:04:55.161 --> 02:05:00.250
<i>But they don't much matter
if you ain't with me</i>

02:05:04.754 --> 02:05:05.755

02:05:07.632 --> 02:05:08.633
Whoa!

02:05:10.343 --> 02:05:12.012

02:05:12.595 --> 02:05:15.390
Well, Jack, are you in or you out?

02:05:16.224 --> 02:05:17.225
Come on.

02:05:17.267 --> 02:05:18.560
I mean, I've been busy, right?

02:05:26.609 --> 02:05:27.652
Yeah!

02:05:27.736 --> 02:05:29.279
