(GASPS) Has it been
that long? Huh.

21:34.827 --> 21:38.095
So, you've been here
all this time?

21:38.097 --> 21:38.896
Uh-huh.

21:38.898 --> 21:43.801
Is the terrible night
we must never
speak of ever over yet?

21:43.902 --> 21:47.438
I think perhaps
I should lie down.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.573
It's been a long night.

21:49.575 --> 21:50.074
Good idea.

21:50.076 --> 21:54.011
Well, I may have been
almost killed
by a centuries old beast

21:54.013 --> 21:55.613
that I was kind of
responsible for,

21:55.615 --> 21:59.850
but I also learned
the true meaning
of Halloween...

21:59.852 --> 22:01.419
Candy.

22:01.421 --> 22:04.455
Ew, gross. Yellow?

22:06.091 --> 22:08.592
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:09.394 --> 22:11.962
(VOCALIZING)
