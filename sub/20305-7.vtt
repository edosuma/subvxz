NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.545 --> 00:05.213
Police! Who's there?

00:05.296 --> 00:06.798
You shot my boy.

00:07.132 --> 00:07.966
I'm sorry.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.385
I'd understood we were here
to discuss charging Perez.

00:10.468 --> 00:13.388
I think this is probably a meeting
to discuss all the pertinent facts.

00:13.471 --> 00:16.141
One of which is we seem to be dealing
with a felony endangerment.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.309
<i>Please note that</i>
<i>the pursuance of the charges</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:20.061
<i>against Mrs. Doris Robson</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:22.480
<i>occurred without my prior knowledge</i>
<i>or consent.</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:24.357
<i>Did you or did you not before the debate</i>

00:24.441 --> 00:26.693
<i>ask me not to politicize</i>
<i>the Robson shooting?</i>

00:26.776 --> 00:30.238
This city's position on aid
to single mothers stinks.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.198
Fay, not now. Please.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.576
-I'm gonna hide cops?
-Four of us.

00:34.659 --> 00:35.827
Murray, get down!

00:36.661 --> 00:37.704
Freeze!

00:38.538 --> 00:39.914
What a business.

00:40.331 --> 00:43.752
You're here to cast your line in a sea
of monolithic indifference.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.504
Let me introduce myself.
Scripps. Randolph Scripps.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.090
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:49.174 --> 00:52.844
We mourn and grieve
for this good woman's loss.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.430
She had a fierce love
for this boy and his future.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.473
I'm coming back, Captain.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.391
I want you to know
I'm not gonna let you down.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.684
You never did, Mike.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.854
We have an opportunity now
to revitalize this city,

01:03.354 --> 01:04.814
to take it in new directions.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.484
Took a secret poll last night, we're in.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.612
Murray, I hope somewhere you're watching
what I do for you.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.794
ESTERHAUS: <i>Item 12, election day,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:26.336 --> 01:32.008
In your last negotiation, your PBA secured
an hour and a half off-duty with pay

01:32.092 --> 01:34.928
for those wishing to exercise
the franchise.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.597
Let's all get the exercise, huh?

01:37.680 --> 01:41.142
Let's also remain vigilant
against abuses of the day's privilege,

01:41.392 --> 01:42.644
illicitly open taverns,

01:42.727 --> 01:46.106
electioneering within prescribed
proximity of polling places,

01:46.189 --> 01:49.067
and those shocking,
thankfully rare, attempts

01:49.150 --> 01:52.445
to manipulate the tally
by enlisting bums to vote repeatedly

01:52.529 --> 01:55.031
under the names of the recently deceased.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.075
Let's hear it, the dead for Daniels.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.493
(laughter)

01:58.576 --> 02:01.454
ESTERHAUS:
Item 13, this memo from division.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.831
(laughs)

02:02.914 --> 02:05.959
"Internal Affairs has concluded
its investigation

02:06.042 --> 02:07.794
in the shooting death of Jimmy Robson.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.713
Judgment regarding internal
disciplinary sanction

02:10.797 --> 02:11.798
is still forthcoming.

02:11.881 --> 02:15.593
However, in the conduct
of Officer Michael Perez,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.471
the panel of inquiry finds no evidence

02:18.721 --> 02:21.558
of intentional or reckless malfeasance

02:21.641 --> 02:25.436
and does not recommend criminal
prosecution in this matter."

02:25.520 --> 02:28.773
(applause)

02:28.857 --> 02:31.860
I'm glad to report Mike
is improving at County General,

02:31.943 --> 02:34.362
although he's not yet receiving visitors.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.406
Now, the Robson boy's funeral
is this morning.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.367
Officer Schnitz reports
we closed contributions

02:39.450 --> 02:43.371
on his memorial fund
at just over $1,000.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.539
(cheers, applause)

02:44.622 --> 02:48.710
Finally, an index of troubled
financial times.

02:48.793 --> 02:53.423
Mahalley's mortuary has offered
up to the department for blind bid

02:53.882 --> 02:58.386
11 prime burial sites at Calvary Cemetery

02:58.469 --> 03:01.222
on which installment payments have lapsed.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.225
Now, those inclined
to plot their futures...

03:04.309 --> 03:07.353
-(laughter)
-...submit sealed bids to Leo,

03:07.437 --> 03:12.650
who also has diagrams of said boneyard
available for your perusal.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.487
It's a grave situation indeed.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.406
(all groaning)

03:19.073 --> 03:20.867
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.493
And hey...

03:23.119 --> 03:25.663
let's be careful out there, huh?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.666
What's all this stuff about funeral plots?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.210
I mean, what's the big deal?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.129
Are you kidding?
People are dying to get in.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.007
It's just a way of planning
for your future. That's all.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.843
I just don't see any reason
to plan that far ahead.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.304
It's also a real-estate investment.
It works.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.889
Leo, can I see the cemetery diagram?

03:42.972 --> 03:43.806
Sure, Luce.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.601
You know, I'm not so sure
I even want to be buried like that.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.518
Thanks.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.022
The Egyptians used to get stuffed.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.857
No. Roy Rogers' horse is stuffed.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.318
And it still works.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.444
Leo!

03:57.153 --> 03:58.988
Uh, here's a sealed bid on plot seven.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.657
Ah, Lieutenant, which one is that?

04:00.740 --> 04:01.783
Oh, uh...

04:02.116 --> 04:04.285
It's this one right here
underneath the spreading Chestnut tree.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.787
That's the one I'm looking at.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.831
Well, Bates, I suggest
you make a competitive bid.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.000
Morning, Miss Davenport.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.126
Good morning, Leo.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.673
-Who are you voting for?
-(laughs) That's a secret.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.883
Joycie! Joycie!

04:21.636 --> 04:23.554
-Alan.
-Congratulations.

04:24.722 --> 04:25.598
For the marriage.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.227
I haven't seen you.
You're looking marvelous.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.814
Thank you. H-how have you been?

04:32.897 --> 04:33.731
Wonderful.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.067
-That's good.
-You know, Joycie,

04:37.151 --> 04:40.863
it occurs to me that there's always been
a kind of emotional barrier between us,

04:41.489 --> 04:42.532
an ambivalence.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.535
I just thought we didn't like
each other very much.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.161
Well, you know why I think that was?

04:47.870 --> 04:49.122
Because I admired you.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.751
And our culture's archaic
male-female dynamic

04:53.835 --> 04:56.004
prevented me
from expressing my admiration.

04:57.964 --> 04:58.923
I'm glad, Alan.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.553
Your fashion sense is uncanny.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.639
Thank you.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.016
Does the clutch purse work with this,

05:08.099 --> 05:10.310
or do you think I'd do better
with a shoulder bag?

05:12.228 --> 05:14.647
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:16.399
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:16.482 --> 05:20.236
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.988
(sirens wailing)

05:27.452 --> 05:31.372
(theme music playing)

06:46.823 --> 06:49.659
The note should read,
"The roses were lovely. Alan."

06:50.284 --> 06:52.078
No. No, just Alan.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.830
Thank you. Thank you so much.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.749
Oh, Frank? There you are.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.834
Counselor.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.003
If I could have just
one moment of your time.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.464
Sure. Come on in.

07:05.633 --> 07:09.095
As executor of Murray Kaplan's estate,
I represent the interests

07:09.178 --> 07:11.097
-of Murray's Wonderland.
-Mm-hm.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.475
I was approached yesterday
by a party seeking

07:14.559 --> 07:16.394
to purchase both property and inventory

07:16.477 --> 07:19.313
at the ridiculous price
of 20 cents on the dollar.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.566
Alan, I-I better go through the files.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.483
Certainly.

07:23.651 --> 07:26.112
Of course, I explained that
because of Murray's death,

07:26.195 --> 07:28.030
the estate is frozen in probate.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.199
- (laughs)
- Gesundheit.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.953
They countered by suggesting
that we sidestep probate,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.080
predate the purchase agreement,

07:36.164 --> 07:39.459
and that with my power of attorney,
I sign as Murray's proxy.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.502
-(stifled chuckle)
-You all right?

07:41.586 --> 07:45.173
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I just have...
a little sinus condition.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.215
Change of weather.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.510
Naturally, Frank, I demurred.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.304
It's not only illegal and unethical,

07:51.387 --> 07:53.055
as a business move, it's a bust.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.184
At which point, these fellows
started pointing their noses to the air,

07:56.267 --> 07:58.644
saying things like, "Do I smell smoke?"

07:58.728 --> 08:00.813
"What are these walls made of? Cardboard?"

08:00.897 --> 08:02.523
Do you see where they're going with this?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.775
Where are you going with it, Alan?

08:05.651 --> 08:06.903
I want protection, Frank.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.698
What about that wrongful-death suit
you were making so much noise about?

08:10.781 --> 08:13.159
Does that shove me out
from under the robes of the law?

08:13.242 --> 08:14.785
No. No.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.622
It certainly merits our attention.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.665
Good for you, Frank.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.376
I can't tell you how
relieved I am to hear you say so.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.338
How did you leave it with these people?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.049
I'm meeting them at Murray's this morning.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.384
Presumably to execute the contracts,

08:30.468 --> 08:33.387
or failing that,
sing songs around the campfire.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.933
I want to put a wire on you.
We want to get them on tape.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.101
Whatever it takes, Frank.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.146
Uh, don't you think it might
be a good idea, Alan,

08:42.230 --> 08:43.523
if you wore a suit and tie?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.902
And unravel eight months
of intensive therapy?

08:49.403 --> 08:50.321
No, I don't think so.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.365
You could get hurt, Alan.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.700
Putting on a suit could
induce a psychic tremor

08:54.784 --> 08:56.869
that rockets me into a prenatal coma.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.955
No disrespect, Frank.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.625
You obviously have a lot to learn
about gender reidentification.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.754
Lucky for me, I was gonna
wear my airy chiffon number.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.383
(sighs) Nah, they'd have seen
right through it.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.593
What about here, Mick?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.512
Please, Lieutenant,
you'll ruin my definition.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.681
-(giggling)
-MICK: How 'bout in one of them?

09:16.764 --> 09:17.932
In one of what?

09:18.724 --> 09:20.101
Inside here.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.227
In my bosom?

09:21.894 --> 09:23.521
Oh, that's good.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.650
Murray, I hope somewhere you're watching
what I do for you.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.069
Come on. Come on.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.740
WOMAN: Officer! Over here!

09:34.824 --> 09:35.700
What's the problem, ma'am?

09:35.783 --> 09:36.784
You see him down there?

09:36.867 --> 09:38.244
That's the man I called you about.

09:38.661 --> 09:43.165
Now, we told him repeatedly,
no campaigning inside prescribed limits.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.543
And he's very polite,
but he just keeps on with it.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.254
Oh! You see, my position is simple.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.423
I don't have the answers.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.051
But I think that if we can start
asking the right questions,

09:54.135 --> 09:57.763
then the answers are going to
spring forth full bloom

09:57.847 --> 09:59.890
like Athena from the head of Zeus.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.060
Thank you very much for listening,
if just for a moment.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.937
Ah, good day, officers.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.399
You here to cast your line
in a sea of monolithic indifference?

10:08.482 --> 10:11.319
Let me introduce myself.
Scripps. Randolph Scripps.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.363
I'm a man of few means
and no end in sight.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.698
It's pleased to make your acquaintance.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.534
Nice to meet you, too,
Mr. Randolph Scripps.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.452
Would you have a...

10:20.119 --> 10:21.621
stand right there for a minute, please.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.539
Mr. Scripps, you see this line right here?

10:24.206 --> 10:26.500
Uh, yes. That is a white line.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.211
That's right.
Now, Mr. Scripps, the election rules state

10:29.295 --> 10:30.755
that you're not allowed to campaign

10:30.838 --> 10:34.008
any closer to the polling place
than this line right here.

10:34.091 --> 10:37.470
Ah! It's not so much a line
as it is a metaphor.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.512
No, sir, it's a line.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.556
You're not supposed to
cross it while campaigning.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.682
A boundary then.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.810
-That's right.
-A mythic demarcation.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.688
On this side, faith, hope--

10:47.772 --> 10:49.190
(honking)

10:49.273 --> 10:50.483
-Stand back there.
-You crazy?

10:50.775 --> 10:54.820
On this side, there's despair, loathing,

10:54.904 --> 10:57.490
and the sepulchral gloom of the pit.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.619
Excuse me. Hello. My name is Scripps.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.371
Call me a fool,
but I think there's a better way.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.039
Do you think that the world
is out of balance?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.583
Do you think that your life
is out of tune?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.252
-Well, whose hands are on the keys?
-Hey, Scripps.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.463
Why is the music so dissonant?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.215
-Just look around.
-Scripps!

11:14.298 --> 11:17.510
Mr. Scripps, I'm sorry to say this, sir,
but I'm gonna have to take you in.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.137
What a world.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.224
The sky is so blue.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.893
The Earth is so green.

11:27.228 --> 11:31.107
Time is so full of possibilities.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.567
MAN: Doris Robson came to our community

11:34.694 --> 11:36.987
some 18 months ago with high hopes.

11:38.239 --> 11:41.409
She didn't bring much,
but she had her little Jimmy.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.622
He was the foundation of her dreams.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.333
She had a fierce love
for this boy and his future.

11:50.584 --> 11:54.672
Miss Robson tells me
that her son loved to read

11:54.755 --> 11:56.298
and act out stories for her.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.885
And he'd greet her that way
when she'd come home.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.639
But sometimes she'd be so low,

12:05.224 --> 12:08.310
it would be hard finding work,
and work wasn't easy,

12:09.645 --> 12:10.896
but he made her laugh.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.524
He lightened her heart.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.444
She loved him so.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.739
This one life,

12:20.948 --> 12:23.451
this small, fragile life.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.911
He hung onto life
even as it was taken from him.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.456
He clung to it.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.000
We mourn and grieve

12:32.376 --> 12:33.878
for this good woman's loss.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.507
And we ask,
"What can we learn from this life?"

12:40.092 --> 12:43.220
This life teaches us
the wisdom of forgiveness.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.807
Because this is the Lord's way.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.685
He teaches us, and we bless him.

12:51.145 --> 12:54.940
Receive unto the hands
of the Lord this good boy

12:55.858 --> 13:00.029
in a place of peace as restful

13:00.321 --> 13:02.531
as the hopes his mother held for him.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.201
Jimmy.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.620
PRIEST: May God rest his soul in peace.

13:08.954 --> 13:09.789
Amen.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.208
ALL: Amen.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.292
Oh, Jimmy.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.919
- (people crying)
- Oh.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.136
The city's government
has to take a stand above partisanship

13:24.220 --> 13:26.722
and address itself
to the greater issue of justice.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.724
I'm sure that Commander Cleveland
would join me

13:28.808 --> 13:33.103
in assuring that substantial reparation
will be made to Mrs. Robson and soon.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.065
In a situation as clear-cut as this,

13:36.148 --> 13:38.275
there's absolutely
no excuse for hesitation.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.402
-This woman's tragic loss...
-Hi. How are ya?

13:40.986 --> 13:41.821
Hello, Captain.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.114
I was coming to see you today.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.367
Everyone feels for her loss.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.078
I feel for her loss.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.207
But what about my loss, Captain?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.583
Have you seen Mike?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.710
Today. They said maybe today.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.421
How are your kids?

14:00.965 --> 14:03.968
They sent Mike Jr.
home from school yesterday.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.137
He got into three fights.

14:08.138 --> 14:12.643
The boys were calling
his father a dirty cop.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.813
And a k-- (crying) and a kid killer.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.941
Do you think it'll help any
if I talk to him?

14:19.024 --> 14:22.486
I don't know. He's very angry right now.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.741
Mike is a very good father.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.036
He's a very good man. He-- (crying)

14:33.873 --> 14:35.875
I just wish they understood.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.509
I have to go to the hospital now.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.678
They said 11:00 o'clock.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.765
Uh, Maria, I'm sorry.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.310
Could I come by later
and talk to your son?

14:55.019 --> 14:56.270
If you'd like, Captain.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.606
Thank you.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.109
Frank, you catch the news last night?

15:02.192 --> 15:05.446
That clip of your ex
waving her baby in my face?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.031
-I missed it.
-Yeah. Great.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.282
What? If Ozzie wins,

15:09.658 --> 15:12.828
he should appoint her
commissioner of unprovoked hysteria.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.955
Frank, it's in the bag.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.041
Took a secret poll last night.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.294
Extensive. We're three points
over the margin of error.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.463
-We're in.
-Congratulations.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.380
Thank you.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.799
I've been doing a lot of thinking, Frank.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.387
Down the road, I'll be nominating someone
to take my place in the chief's office.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.724
You're your own man, Frank,
but time and again

15:33.807 --> 15:35.392
you've been Johnny on the spot for me--

15:35.476 --> 15:36.727
a cool head in a crisis.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.187
The way you handled this Robson thing.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.315
I obviously can't make
any firm commitments yet.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.193
But this could pay big dividends
for you, Frank.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.570
So you are laying it off on me.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.908
Dennis, some people
are simply more effective

15:50.991 --> 15:52.159
following orders than giving them.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.745
The letter you read
at the debate hung me out to dry.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.373
You remain deputy chief as long as--

15:57.456 --> 15:58.290
You listen to me!

15:58.999 --> 16:00.376
Promises were made to me.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.296
I've waited too long.
I've worked too hard.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.925
I've buried too many bodies to lie down
and let somebody else walk over me!

16:08.008 --> 16:10.678
-Dennis, this is not the time--
-I'm gonna bring you down!

16:12.179 --> 16:13.013
You mark me.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.848
I'm gonna bring you all down.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.436
The man's an empty glass, Frank.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.272
A lot of them in public life.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.274
He's just not front-rank material.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.527
Oh, Mrs. Furillo.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.446
So that's what I've been thinking, Frank.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.949
I hope it doesn't displease you,
both of you.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.450
It's something to think about.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.454
First there's still this small matter
of an election to win.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.124
I trust I can count on your vote.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.542
Eh, Chief?

16:43.585 --> 16:45.421
(engine turns over)

16:47.006 --> 16:49.049
That's my guy. Let's go.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.802
He called you chief.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.555
-Is this a joke?
-Maybe. Probably.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.765
You're not laughing.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.559
I've heard it before.

17:01.603 --> 17:02.438
Here.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.817
Mr. Scripps,
I'm Lieutenant Henry Goldblume.

17:06.900 --> 17:07.776
How do you do, sir?

17:09.445 --> 17:13.449
I understand our officers explained
the electioneering restrictions to you.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.159
(chuckles) Yes, quite thoroughly.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.952
Then you do understand
you're not to campaign

17:17.036 --> 17:18.620
any closer than the lines allow?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.831
Yes, sir. I won't be doing it again.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.041
I'm glad to hear that.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.459
It's just that...

17:24.793 --> 17:27.087
well, I have so much ground to make up
and there's so little time.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.381
I just announced
my candidacy this morning.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.218
Politics is a funny business.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.387
Yes, it's funny, but it's essential.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.559
Well... I think we can let Mr. Scripps go.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.105
Let's not have any more trouble
out there today, shall we?

17:45.189 --> 17:46.190
Certainly not.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.941
This is the kind of thing
I want to address

17:48.025 --> 17:49.526
only after taking office.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.445
Pleasure, Lieutenant.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.697
Good luck to you.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.325
Thank you, sir.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.703
Thank you very much indeed.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.624
You're a lucky man, Mr. Scripps.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.502
You get to go home
and watch it all on TV now, don't you?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.797
-You ain't gonna be here anymore.
-Henry! Henry!

18:09.880 --> 18:10.756
HENRY: Hi, Fay.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.549
Are you busy tonight?

18:12.633 --> 18:13.634
Uh... why?

18:13.717 --> 18:16.595
I just got a call inviting me
to Cleveland headquarters.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.721
Really? What for?

18:18.013 --> 18:20.182
I don't know. He probably saw me
on the news last night.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.226
Anyhow, the aide said
he wants to meet with me.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.727
-Did he say why?
-No.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.979
I don't know, Henry. I just--

18:26.063 --> 18:28.482
I just have this funny feeling
like-like something's gonna happen,

18:28.565 --> 18:30.025
something good. I can't explain it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.193
That's wonderful, isn't it?

18:31.860 --> 18:32.736
I guess so.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.030
Anyhow, my mother's gonna babysit.
Can you come?

18:35.114 --> 18:35.948
Of course I can.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.700
Henry, what if he wins?

18:38.784 --> 18:40.327
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.411
I wouldn't hold my breath.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.956
But it's possible, isn't it?
I mean, he really could win.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.209
-Sure, it is.
-(sighs)

18:49.336 --> 18:51.964
(muffled chattering)

19:19.032 --> 19:20.576
-Hello, Liz.
-You!

19:22.202 --> 19:24.705
-How are you?
-Why didn't you tell me you were a cop?

19:25.539 --> 19:26.915
Well, you never asked me.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.294
There was a lot of
insincerity in what you did. You know?

19:31.587 --> 19:32.963
Well, I apologize.

19:33.046 --> 19:35.048
-It's part of the job.
-I guess.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.551
You know, Liz,
I so enjoyed our talk the other day,

19:37.634 --> 19:40.053
I was wondering
if perhaps we couldn't meet

19:40.137 --> 19:42.306
in some more congenial environment.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.141
Absolutely not.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.726
No chance. Forget about it.

19:46.476 --> 19:50.022
Well, friendship isn't impossible
under these circumstances, Liz.

19:50.480 --> 19:54.860
I was seeing a lady of your occupational
persuasion till quite recently

19:54.943 --> 19:57.863
until our cultural differences
became too pronounced.

19:57.946 --> 20:01.325
Ed, read my lips, no way.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.453
(sighs)

20:05.954 --> 20:08.123
Okay. All right.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.669
Ed?

20:18.258 --> 20:19.593
You still got some time left.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.555
Oh. (chuckles)

20:24.890 --> 20:25.724
Right.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.273
I am searching for a subject
that commends itself to brevity.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.361
Whoops. Liz!

20:37.444 --> 20:38.278
LIZ: Ed?

20:38.695 --> 20:39.529
Do you want...

20:40.656 --> 20:43.242
or would you rather I just go away?

20:44.284 --> 20:45.244
LIZ: Your token.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.539
Ed!

20:50.165 --> 20:50.999
Yes?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.001
LIZ: Yeah, I'd like to.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.380
- You'd like me to go away?
- No, no! To talk.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.424
I mean, you seemed like
a pretty nice guy the other day.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.927
That's why I was so PO'd
when you turned out to be a cop.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.303
Drat. I can't find it!

21:03.387 --> 21:04.721
-What?
-Another token.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.433
-Oh, we can't get it up from our side.
-Do you hear me clearly in there?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.979
-Yeah.
-I-I read you very well out here.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.065
-Would you call that symbolic, Liz?
-What?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.693
Well, aching for exchange,

21:17.776 --> 21:20.320
confronting the walls
of the isolated past,

21:20.404 --> 21:22.030
the barriers of our natures.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.532
Is Ed your real name?

21:26.493 --> 21:28.578
-Howard.
-You're kidding!

21:28.996 --> 21:31.331
-That's my father's name, too!
-No.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.583
(laughs)

21:35.085 --> 21:36.086
I like you.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.673
I like you, too, Liz.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.550
Try to get it up.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.015
-Sorry?
-Well, I can't get it up from this side.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.349
Try it from your side.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.359
Liz! I can't raise it.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.069
-Well, go get tokens.
-All right.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.322
-Hurry!
-Wait! Wait!

22:03.405 --> 22:05.240
I'll be right back. I'm going for tokens.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.408
I got to talk to you.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.285
Hey, can't talk now, babe.

22:08.702 --> 22:09.828
Here. Take my card.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.622
And give me a call
at the precinct later on, okay?

22:13.123 --> 22:14.750
MICK:
This looks like it's gonna work, Alan.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.792
How does it feel?

22:16.209 --> 22:18.962
Testing. One, two, three. Testing.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.255
Mick!

22:21.631 --> 22:24.968
Mick! Come on, give me some tokens.

22:25.969 --> 22:26.803
Hurry! Hurry!

22:26.887 --> 22:28.555
-Something wrong?
-I don't know yet.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.934
The guy's hot to trot, huh?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.227
What can I do for you?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.646
Hey, good-looking.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.024
Bud Truax, naughty fashions.
You must be--

22:39.107 --> 22:39.983
In charge.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.444
Who's the eyeful-- eyeful?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.446
I'm Mr. Kaplan's attorney.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.866
Oh. God rest poor Murray. I just heard.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.701
I've been coming in here seven years.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.453
Murray Kaplan was a saint.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.372
Had a heart like a side of beef.

22:54.081 --> 22:54.956
You been with Murray long?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.375
Not that long, no.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.002
Murray, they broke
the mold after that guy.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.253
<i>The man understood.</i>

23:00.337 --> 23:01.630
Liz, I'm back!

23:02.589 --> 23:04.966
We can take our time.
I got lots of tokens.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.096
What was it you wanted exactly?

23:09.721 --> 23:12.974
Well, as a matter of fact,
I just got our new fall line.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.310
Take a look, touch, you feel.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.855
This is a hot little item
we call the Iron Maiden.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.483
Black-patent Corinthian leather.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.735
Stainless-steel stays.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.572
Knock eight inches off the most
indulgent waistline.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.908
Uh... you want to move over here, bud?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.243
BUD: Certainly.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.414
Right on time.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.875
Mr. Roeblick's gonna notarize
our agreement.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.045
Uh, he lost about four days
right after Pearl Harbor.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.131
Been trying to get him back ever since.

23:45.507 --> 23:48.093
Funniest thing,
he thinks it's last Friday.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.055
Um...

23:52.722 --> 23:55.058
If you could go over
the particulars one more time...

23:55.142 --> 23:56.685
-Nice dress.
-Nice face.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.271
Well, I just want to make sure
we're in complete synchronization

23:59.354 --> 24:00.981
before we finalize the agreement.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.149
What's the problem?

24:02.232 --> 24:03.400
Do you smell smoke in here?

24:04.109 --> 24:06.111
You know, it is a bit smoky, isn't it?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.072
Look...

24:09.781 --> 24:12.200
-Well, I call 'em...
-Uh, um... please.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.454
Let's not hasten this unnecessarily,
my friends.

24:15.537 --> 24:20.083
I just-- I simply want
to address both your problems

24:20.167 --> 24:22.669
and the problems of Mr. Kaplan's family.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.088
That's... touching.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.798
-Do you smell smoke?
-(groans)

24:26.882 --> 24:29.259
-I think he gets the idea.
-No, I mean really.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.805
-It's a wire!
-Police! Freeze!

24:34.681 --> 24:36.016
(shouting)

24:36.516 --> 24:37.350
(laughing)

24:40.187 --> 24:41.021
Get 'em, Mick!

24:42.856 --> 24:43.982
Police! Freeze!

24:45.317 --> 24:48.028
-No guns! No guns!
-I got 'em covered, guys.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.072
(knock on door)

24:53.658 --> 24:56.495
Mike, Captain Furillo's here to see you.

24:57.871 --> 24:58.955
Hi, Mike. How you doing?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.376
Hear you've been having
a tough time in school.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.338
Yeah.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.594
You want to talk about it?

25:14.930 --> 25:15.764
No.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.646
-Listen, maybe if you--
-Why don't you just get out?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.899
Why don't we both just get out?
You feel like taking a walk?

25:29.611 --> 25:30.987
Your brother and sister play here?

25:31.780 --> 25:32.614
Yeah.

25:34.074 --> 25:34.908
Do you come here, too?

25:38.411 --> 25:40.830
Do you know what you're angry at, Mike,
and do you know why?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.585
You're angry at your dad, aren't you?

25:46.670 --> 25:47.963
They're saying all this stuff about him.

25:49.005 --> 25:49.839
You think it's true?

25:51.424 --> 25:52.259
I don't know.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.804
He's a good cop. He always has been.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.347
He still is.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.516
He killed him, didn't he?

25:59.599 --> 26:02.519
Yes, but it was an accident.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.688
He was doing his job,

26:04.771 --> 26:06.314
and something happened
he couldn't control.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.278
That could happen to any cop... any time.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.532
That's what the job's like.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.995
I mean, that's why cops
are different, you know?

26:22.163 --> 26:23.748
That kid's mother must hate my dad.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.297
Yeah. She--

26:30.880 --> 26:32.591
At first she did, but she forgave him.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.759
If she can forgive him, you can, too.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.596
You have to.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.807
And what am I supposed to do
when they make fun of me,

26:40.890 --> 26:42.475
when they wanna fight with me?

26:44.477 --> 26:47.272
Well, the best way to show them
how tough you are is not to fight back.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.568
Mike, people are gonna say things
because they don't know any better,

26:52.152 --> 26:53.361
because they don't understand.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.616
But you have to take care
of the family now.

26:57.949 --> 26:58.825
Your mom needs you.

26:59.951 --> 27:00.910
Your dad does, too.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.289
What's gonna happen to him?

27:05.624 --> 27:06.666
Is he gonna be okay?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.419
Yeah, he is.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.547
It may take some time, but...

27:16.968 --> 27:17.844
I'm scared.

27:22.766 --> 27:24.184
I'm gonna see your dad today.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.561
Anything you want me to tell him?

27:28.897 --> 27:29.898
Tell him to come home.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.693
(voice breaking) Tell him that I love him.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.533
-Frank, we got the two arsonists.
-Clean bust?

27:40.617 --> 27:42.702
We lost the wire, but we may
have enough without it.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.497
The lawyer is here.
He's with Wachtel in interrogation.

27:45.580 --> 27:47.165
-Let's call ADA Bernstein.
-He's already with her.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.125
-Frank, you better take a look at this.
-What?

27:49.209 --> 27:51.461
<i>...nine years,</i>
<i>the last three as deputy chief.</i>

27:52.504 --> 27:54.172
<i>A man I once respected.</i>

27:55.548 --> 27:57.676
<i>But reflecting</i>
<i>upon his shameless manipulation</i>

27:57.759 --> 27:59.636
<i>of the events</i>
<i>of the past couple of weeks,</i>

28:00.220 --> 28:02.681
<i>I can no longer</i>
<i>in good conscience remain silent.</i>

28:03.181 --> 28:06.393
<i>On October 24th,</i>
<i>following the shooting of Jimmy Robson,</i>

28:06.476 --> 28:09.312
<i>I had a meeting</i>
<i>with Chief Fletcher Daniels in his office</i>

28:09.688 --> 28:12.148
<i>in which he suggested</i>
<i>that we prosecute Mrs. Robson</i>

28:12.232 --> 28:15.652
<i>on child endangerment</i>
<i>in order to, and I quote,</i>

28:16.277 --> 28:19.406
<i>"Take the heat off the department</i>
<i>and my candidacy."</i>

28:19.489 --> 28:22.450
Frank, they're getting
a little impatient out there.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.078
<i>...where, after a meeting</i>
<i>with Captain Frank Furillo</i>

28:25.745 --> 28:27.956
<i>and assistant DA Irwin Bernstein,</i>

28:28.748 --> 28:31.835
<i>Mrs. Robson was arrested</i>
<i>by officers from Hill Street</i>

28:32.460 --> 28:34.462
<i>on the order of Captain Furillo.</i>

28:35.630 --> 28:37.799
<i>Chief Daniels yesterday</i>
<i>disavowed knowledge</i>

28:37.882 --> 28:39.384
<i>of the bringing of these charges.</i>

28:39.718 --> 28:41.344
<i>That is a blatant lie.</i>

28:41.428 --> 28:43.930
<i>People will question rightfully</i>
<i>why I've waited to come forward.</i>

28:44.013 --> 28:47.225
<i>I can only say that my own culpability</i>
<i>has become more than I can bear.</i>

28:48.393 --> 28:51.563
<i>I fully endorse the candidacy</i>
<i>of Commander Cleveland.</i>

28:52.188 --> 28:53.314
-Frank?
<i>-A man whose integrity</i>

28:53.398 --> 28:54.649
<i>is beyond reproach.</i>

28:55.275 --> 28:57.152
<i>I am proud of the years</i>
<i>that I've served this city</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:59.195
<i>and this department,</i>
<i>and I am looking forward to many--</i>

29:00.530 --> 29:03.324
Captain?
This is the check from the Robson fund.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.535
I'd like to have it delivered
to Mrs. Robson in her apartment.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.203
I'd like it to be a couple of uniforms.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.371
We'll do it after we vote.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.664
It's appreciated.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.084
Unacceptable! Unacceptable! Unacceptable!

29:13.585 --> 29:14.836
Frank, this is Arnold Aames,

29:14.919 --> 29:17.255
representing Gardner
Waste Management Systems.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.716
-Pleasure.
-I want one percent for our good faith

29:19.799 --> 29:21.718
-and one percent for the royalty!
-What do we have?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.845
Working on
a triangulated agreement, Frank.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.805
-It's a little complicated.
-Not because of me.

29:25.889 --> 29:26.806
How's the burn?

29:26.890 --> 29:27.932
First degree, thank God.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.185
If my brassiere had caught fire,
I'd be fighting for my life.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.104
You're here--

29:33.188 --> 29:35.482
I'm here representing the three men
you have in custody, Captain.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.524
The arsonists.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.984
Alleged arsonists.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.861
Little, Andrews, and Roeblick.

29:39.944 --> 29:41.362
All employees of Gardner Waste.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.781
It goes as follows, Frank,

29:42.864 --> 29:45.366
Gardner Waste has agreed
to come up considerably

29:45.450 --> 29:47.076
from their original offer for Wonderland.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.453
Ninety cents on the dollar.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.997
Mr. Kaplan's family
would also retain a royalty

29:51.080 --> 29:52.665
for the continued use
of Murray's good name

29:52.749 --> 29:55.376
-in connection with the Wonderland.
-One percent of all gross incomes.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.420
I want two percent
with full oversight access

29:57.504 --> 29:59.839
to all accounting procedures,
or it's not gonna fly!

29:59.923 --> 30:02.091
Please, Alan, just let me finish.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.637
Representing the interests
of the Kaplan family,

30:05.720 --> 30:09.182
Alan would agree not to pursue
a wrongful-death suit against the city.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.268
We've agreed on a cash settlement,
thereby avoiding a lengthy trial.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.436
Cut to the chase, Irwin.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.522
I've spoken to the DA
and the Corporation Council.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.065
They've cleared it from our end.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.944
We will decline to prosecute the three men
arrested at Murray's this morning.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.112
Threats were made
that fully justified those arrests.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.197
Upon reflection, Frank,

30:24.280 --> 30:26.407
I think the remarks
concerning smoke and fire

30:26.491 --> 30:27.700
were significantly ambiguous.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.829
Since when do we trade arrests
to protect special interests?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.081
Your men were gonna be named
in that civil suit, Frank.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.290
It's your interest, too.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.960
So if you will agree
to release these three men...

30:37.043 --> 30:40.338
(sighs) I think everyone's interest
in this matter

30:40.672 --> 30:42.090
can be very neatly served.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.758
I want my two percent!

30:43.842 --> 30:47.178
Alan, does your fire insurance
specifically cover arson?

30:47.262 --> 30:48.388
One percent we could live with.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.764
Excellent.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.891
God forbid Mrs. Kaplan
should have to worry.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.351
Excuse me, Frank.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.813
You had about 20 calls
regarding Mahoney's statement.

30:56.896 --> 30:59.190
-Later, Ray.
-Chief Daniels is in your office.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.358
Can we go ahead, Frank?

31:01.776 --> 31:02.694
I don't see why not.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.364
Seeing as how everybody's interests
are being so neatly served here.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.324
Frank...

31:09.868 --> 31:11.119
You're a very special person.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.548
Chief.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.049
Do me a favor, Frank.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.760
Reach over and pull this knife
out of my back, will you?

31:28.720 --> 31:31.556
I always knew Dennis
was a little tightly wrapped.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.641
He was effective in the right spot.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.268
Live by the hatchet...

31:35.351 --> 31:37.228
Polls are only open four more hours.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.230
-He's probably too late.
-Even so--

31:39.314 --> 31:41.524
I'm issuing a statement at 5:00.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.570
We'll position him as a disturbed,
disenfranchised functionary.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.031
There's his therapy history
to deal with, too.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.616
What therapy history?

31:49.699 --> 31:51.701
Hospitalized for depression twice.

31:51.993 --> 31:54.746
Been under a psychiatrist's
care six years now.

31:54.829 --> 31:55.747
Very hush, hush.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.498
That has to be out
of the personnel record.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.666
You can't reveal that.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.627
Somebody's already revealed it, Frank,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.879
I'll simply comment
on what's public knowledge.

32:03.713 --> 32:04.797
Want to be there for the statement?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.424
I don't think so.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.177
Now, on your end, Frank.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.930
Questions are gonna start
coming fast and furious.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.514
Wanna lay low for a while?

32:13.598 --> 32:14.599
I'll be all right.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.267
We'll see it through, Frank.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.937
They can't very well go back
and change their votes, can they?

32:19.228 --> 32:20.605
-Not to my knowledge.
-'Course not.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.482
They'll see him for the lunatic he is.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.859
Well, gotta go vote myself now.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.111
Then the Mrs. and I
are gonna bowl a few lines

32:27.195 --> 32:28.529
and head over to the hotel.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.323
Hope to see you there.

32:31.741 --> 32:32.659
Thank you, Frank.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.369
Thanks for everything.

32:36.579 --> 32:40.416
Quincy's gone, Murray's gone.
Got nothing now, nothing.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.542
You still got your job.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.211
How long you think that's gonna last?

32:43.294 --> 32:44.963
You think they're gonna pay,
these new dudes?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.673
They don't pay, man, I gotta walk.

32:46.756 --> 32:47.674
Maybe that's good, Vicki.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.550
Why don't you get yourself
on the program, huh?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.843
Get yourself straight.
You know, you probably

32:50.927 --> 32:52.679
-could turn things around for you.
-I've done programs.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.597
Don't preach me programs.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.265
What do you want me to do, huh Vicki?

32:56.349 --> 32:57.433
You can hire me.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.352
-As what?
-Be a snitch.

32:59.435 --> 33:02.105
(laughs) Sorry, Vicki.
I'm kinda over my budget on snitches.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.648
Look, I got you Quincy!

33:03.731 --> 33:05.525
And I got your pictures in the paper!

33:05.608 --> 33:08.528
You guys come in,
police operation-- big deal!

33:08.611 --> 33:10.363
And you just shoot up people's lives!

33:10.446 --> 33:13.032
Shoot up the way they live,
and you think you can just leave?!

33:13.116 --> 33:14.659
-Hey, what can I say, huh?
-You owe me!

33:14.742 --> 33:16.828
Hey, you look here now!
I don't owe you nothing!

33:16.911 --> 33:18.705
You are a stone junkie,

33:18.788 --> 33:20.665
and I just saved your butt
from going to jail!

33:20.748 --> 33:22.500
You didn't save me from nothing!

33:22.583 --> 33:24.127
You shoot up people's lives!

33:25.128 --> 33:26.129
Hey, look...

33:28.756 --> 33:30.008
Still got the card I gave you?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.720
You call me next week, okay?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.097
If you got something for me, we'll talk.

33:36.764 --> 33:37.598
Now go ahead.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.773
What's eating you?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.026
Nothing.

33:48.234 --> 33:50.319
Then why are you
acting like a cigar-store Indian?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.699
I just can't get it out of my mind.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.409
-What?
-Dying.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.246
All that talk about cemetery plots?
(scoffs)

34:01.456 --> 34:03.416
I know it's dumb, but it's making me nuts.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.876
Okay. It happens to everybody.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.337
It's like you know you're gonna,
you're gonna die, right?

34:08.838 --> 34:11.215
And when you've been dead
for a million years,

34:11.299 --> 34:15.011
that is just a fraction
of how long you're gonna be dead--

34:15.094 --> 34:15.970
which is forever.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.473
It's getting morbid in here.

34:19.807 --> 34:21.184
At least if I got stuffed--

34:21.267 --> 34:22.769
Hey, nobody gets stuffed.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.980
I've been reading this book
about Egyptians--

34:26.064 --> 34:28.191
The Egyptians did not get stuffed.
They got wrapped.

34:28.274 --> 34:30.526
They got stuffed,
and then they got wrapped.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.821
WOMAN (on the radio):
<i>Any unit in vicinity Dekker and 76th,</i>

34:33.905 --> 34:35.656
<i>411 in progress. See the man.</i>

34:35.740 --> 34:38.618
-That is right around this corner.
-(siren wailing)

34:47.043 --> 34:48.503
All right, what's going on here?

34:48.586 --> 34:49.837
Who called this thing in?

34:50.630 --> 34:52.298
Here. Here, Officer.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.133
I'm not trying to do anything.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.386
I came out, this guy
tried to get some money from me.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.055
-N-- N--
-Scripps.

34:59.138 --> 35:00.098
When I refused,

35:00.181 --> 35:02.141
he grabbed ahold of me
and tried to take my wallet.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.060
Officers, thank goodness you're here.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.270
-Unhand me, sir!
-Let the guy go.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.232
One dollar, just one dollar
from every citizen

35:09.315 --> 35:11.192
would be enough to put me over the top.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.486
Now, that's not asking too much, is it?

35:13.569 --> 35:14.695
We're gonna have to take you in.

35:14.779 --> 35:15.947
But I'm not guilty of anything

35:16.030 --> 35:18.491
except for perhaps
a slight overzealousness.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.326
Considering how belatedly
I started my campaign,

35:20.409 --> 35:22.286
-that's perfectly understandable.
-All right, let's go.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.122
It's this ungodly pressure.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.124
The polls close in three hours.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.752
Voter awareness of my programs
is certainly not catching fire.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.379
It's uphill all the way.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.090
I don't like this hallway one single bit.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.883
It'll only take a second, Andy.

35:43.766 --> 35:44.600
What?

35:45.226 --> 35:46.310
Mrs. Robson, please.

35:46.894 --> 35:47.895
She's busy.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.897
Just wanted to give her something.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.358
She doesn't want anything from you.

35:52.441 --> 35:54.902
It's a contribution to the fund for Jimmy.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.822
Easing your conscience?

35:58.614 --> 36:00.032
Hey, pal, there's over $1,000

36:00.116 --> 36:00.950
-in that envelope.
-Andy, hey--

36:01.033 --> 36:02.660
-We all collected--
-Is that what a dead child's

36:02.743 --> 36:04.871
-worth these days?
-MRS. ROBSON: What's the trouble, John?

36:05.955 --> 36:06.914
No trouble.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.749
Mrs. Robson.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.959
Officers?

36:10.585 --> 36:11.794
Our condolences, ma'am.

36:11.878 --> 36:14.297
This is for Jimmy's fund from Hill Street.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.257
Please accept it with our sympathies.

36:23.472 --> 36:25.308
John, you could go inside now.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.733
Officer Hill and Renko, isn't it?

36:34.275 --> 36:35.109
Yes, ma'am.

36:36.110 --> 36:36.944
Thank you.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.032
Thank the other officers for me.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.162
Thank you for your kindness.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.590
Please, we must find some way to expedite.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.342
I... I've got to get back out there.

36:59.425 --> 37:03.638
Mr. Scripps, two arrests
in such a short span of time

37:03.721 --> 37:04.889
make that problematical.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.060
Well, if there's any hope
of holding that back from the public

37:09.143 --> 37:12.188
until they've had an opportunity
to make their decision

37:12.271 --> 37:14.065
free from the cult of personality

37:14.148 --> 37:17.568
based solely on the merits
of what each one of us stands for then--

37:17.652 --> 37:19.195
Mr. Scripps is running for mayor.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.697
Miss Davenport...

37:26.702 --> 37:30.331
I fervently believe
that there is still among us,

37:30.831 --> 37:33.751
and in us, a quorum of decency.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.295
That the hearts of the people
of this country

37:36.379 --> 37:37.838
are vibrant with goodwill.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.465
Quiescent, perhaps,

37:40.466 --> 37:43.761
but just waiting to answer a call.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.472
And I intend to sound that call.

37:49.016 --> 37:51.519
Mr. Scripps, once the election's decided,

37:51.602 --> 37:54.188
can we assume your urgency about all this

37:54.272 --> 37:56.148
is going to relax?

37:56.565 --> 37:57.608
(laughs)

37:57.692 --> 38:00.903
Well, unless, of course, we carry the day.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.446
And if you don't carry the day?

38:02.947 --> 38:07.493
Well, naturally, that's a prospect
that no politician is fond to consider.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.454
But if you don't,
could we assume that there'd be an end

38:10.538 --> 38:12.456
to the kind of incident we've had today?

38:14.000 --> 38:14.834
Lieutenant...

38:16.419 --> 38:19.088
only a fool flies in the face
of the democratic process.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.926
How eager is complainant to pursue?

38:24.010 --> 38:26.262
I've explained the court
appearances to him.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.347
He's less than enthusiastic.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.392
Polls close in about an hour.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.270
There should be
some paperwork to clear up.

38:34.562 --> 38:35.563
Take about an hour.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.482
Can I go now?

38:39.108 --> 38:40.526
It'll take a little while yet.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.820
You're gonna give me a solemn promise

38:42.903 --> 38:44.905
that you'll stay out of trouble
for the rest of the day.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.159
My hand on it, sir.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.121
We'll see what we can do.

38:54.081 --> 38:54.915
SCRIPPS: Lieutenant...

38:55.791 --> 39:00.254
Um... (laughs)
if we should fall short today,

39:00.338 --> 39:03.883
you'd honor me if you
would consider coming aboard

39:03.966 --> 39:06.552
and managing my next campaign.

39:07.595 --> 39:11.349
(laughs)
I know that I barely know you, but...

39:13.392 --> 39:18.147
I sense that we share a vision
of the essential wonder of this world.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.904
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.496
-Then what happened?
-Well, I went back to the booth,

39:33.579 --> 39:34.580
and she was gone.

39:34.663 --> 39:37.041
She must've been frightened or confused--

39:37.124 --> 39:39.251
Oh, Judas. Who knows, Henry.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.462
But what troubles you?

39:41.545 --> 39:46.425
(laughs) What troubles me is realizing
that I am attracted to these fragile,

39:46.509 --> 39:48.135
victimized, neurotic women.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.680
I mean, she is hardly the first, Henry.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.599
Fragile ego structure?

39:53.682 --> 39:54.600
I guess.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.852
What I can't reconcile

39:56.936 --> 39:59.814
-is that consciously, this...
-(booth curtains rumbles)

40:02.233 --> 40:03.401
...prototype, if you will,

40:03.484 --> 40:06.487
is the furthest imaginable person

40:06.570 --> 40:09.156
that I envision spending my life with.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.867
What's she look like? Do you have an idea?

40:11.951 --> 40:12.868
Certainly.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.912
She's blond, mid-30s,

40:14.995 --> 40:17.289
self-assured, confident, professional.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.626
Got solid career prospects.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.545
She's tall and slim.

40:23.838 --> 40:27.133
She moves with the supple
muscular grace of an athlete.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.553
Or a dancer... which, in fact,
she may once have been.

40:30.636 --> 40:31.470
She's...

40:32.138 --> 40:32.972
HENRY: Willowy?

40:33.389 --> 40:35.182
Ah... willowy and sensual.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.270
Frank in the expression
of her needs and desires,

40:39.895 --> 40:43.107
but completely capable
of the most genteel femininity.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.152
Stylishly understated dress.

40:47.069 --> 40:49.905
Well-- well-read in history and poetry.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.116
Firm grasp of her own opinions.

40:53.701 --> 40:54.535
But, uh...

40:55.911 --> 40:57.997
A light, musical laugh.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.833
A firm handshake.

41:00.916 --> 41:02.042
(inhales deeply)

41:02.585 --> 41:04.253
Maybe she wears glasses.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.213
Maybe she's out there, Howard.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.632
But where, Henry. Where?

41:15.139 --> 41:15.973
(chuckles)

41:16.265 --> 41:19.143
You know, I always get a kick
in the old adrenals

41:19.560 --> 41:22.730
every time I give that lever a yank.

41:38.871 --> 41:39.830
(chuckles)

41:39.914 --> 41:42.708
You know, when I'm in that booth
by myself,

41:42.791 --> 41:45.294
I can't help but feel the weight
of the mantle of freedom.

41:45.377 --> 41:47.796
It's like the hand of an old
and trusted friend.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.549
Freedom demands participation,
don't you think?

41:51.175 --> 41:52.134
Yes.

41:52.218 --> 41:53.344
It's an obligation.

41:54.136 --> 41:56.263
I'd say it's a sacred responsibility.

41:56.680 --> 42:00.351
I must say it is heartening to know
that there are enough of us left

42:00.434 --> 42:04.396
running counter to this infernal apathy
to still make a democracy of it.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.981
Oh, shoot!

42:06.732 --> 42:10.027
I wasn't in there ten minutes,
not ten minutes.

42:11.403 --> 42:12.238
Oh.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.574
Madam, allow me.

42:15.658 --> 42:16.534
Allow you?

42:16.617 --> 42:19.286
Allow me to dispense
with this inconvenience.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.080
I'm a police officer.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.916
Lieutenant Howard Hunter at your service.

42:23.999 --> 42:26.460
Oh. Would you, Lieutenant?

42:27.419 --> 42:29.838
It would be my very distinct pleasure.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.217
-Oh! Lieutenant, you're a dear.
-Ah!

42:33.300 --> 42:34.802
I've had four this month already.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.679
You've salvaged my day.

42:36.762 --> 42:39.181
Well, whatever I can do to help.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.725
Where are you stationed?
Please, let me call.

42:41.809 --> 42:43.060
Perhaps buy you a drink.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.814
Give me a chance to more
properly express my gratitude.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.068
Uh, Hill Street.

42:53.779 --> 42:54.989
Ah, Hill Street station.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.324
Well, wonderful. I'll be in touch.

42:58.158 --> 42:59.952
Oh, I-I look forward to it.

43:00.035 --> 43:00.869
Thanks again.

43:01.495 --> 43:02.329
Bye.

43:02.746 --> 43:03.581
Bye now.

43:14.049 --> 43:14.883
HENRY: Who was that?

43:16.135 --> 43:17.928
(laughs)

43:19.221 --> 43:23.100
Sometimes, Henry, life is kind.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.781
Woman's taken my wallet.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.492
<i>With 14 percent of the city's</i>
<i>precincts reporting,</i>

43:40.576 --> 43:43.454
<i>we're projecting</i>
<i>a 56 to 42 percent margin,</i>

43:43.537 --> 43:46.206
<i>a stunning, decisive victory</i>
<i>in the mayoral race</i>

43:46.290 --> 43:48.792
<i>for last-minute replacement candidate</i>
<i>Ozzie Cleveland.</i>

43:48.876 --> 43:49.918
<i>Supporters are gathering now</i>

43:50.002 --> 43:52.379
<i>at his election headquarters</i>
<i>at the Oakwood Hotel</i>

43:52.463 --> 43:53.881
<i>for what will undoubtedly be</i>

43:53.964 --> 43:57.051
<i>one of the most joyous victory</i>
<i>celebrations in recent memory.</i>

43:57.343 --> 44:00.179
<i>Cleveland began his campaign</i>
<i>just ten days ago,</i>

44:00.262 --> 44:02.264
<i>-after the tragic death...</i>
-Who did you vote for?

44:03.849 --> 44:04.975
Who did you vote for?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.268
I asked first.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.729
Listen, I gotta go see Mike Perez.

44:09.563 --> 44:11.440
-You want some company?
-Yes.

44:12.691 --> 44:17.154
(indistinct conversations)

44:17.237 --> 44:20.032
I understand... we have a concession.

44:20.115 --> 44:22.576
(cheers, applause)

44:22.660 --> 44:25.079
(clamoring)

44:26.121 --> 44:28.332
My first action is to go downstairs
to the ballroom

44:28.415 --> 44:31.001
and thank all those wonderful people
who worked so hard.

44:31.085 --> 44:33.712
-What appointments do you plan to make?
-Who will you fill your office?

44:33.796 --> 44:35.047
Before you ask any more questions,

44:35.130 --> 44:37.174
I'd just like to say that I believe

44:37.549 --> 44:40.552
that this is the dawn
of a new era for this city.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.639
We have an opportunity now
to revitalize this city,

44:43.722 --> 44:45.099
to take it in new directions,

44:45.683 --> 44:47.434
to make it a great city again.

44:48.644 --> 44:51.647
Tonight, I just want to thank God

44:51.730 --> 44:53.524
and the people of this city
for making this possible.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.192
I feel blessed.

44:56.276 --> 44:58.862
(applause)

45:00.322 --> 45:02.658
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go downstairs

45:02.741 --> 45:05.285
and tell all those wonderful,
exhausted people

45:05.703 --> 45:07.996
to take a deep breath and enjoy tonight,

45:08.080 --> 45:11.250
because tomorrow morning
the hard work is just beginning!

45:11.333 --> 45:12.835
Bobby!

45:12.918 --> 45:15.003
(clamoring)

45:25.889 --> 45:29.601
(sobbing) No, no. No!
It was all a mistake!

45:29.685 --> 45:32.020
-I'll go get help.
-No! No! No!

45:32.521 --> 45:33.439
I'm not even--

45:33.522 --> 45:35.441
-This? This is what you want?
-I don't understand

45:35.524 --> 45:38.527
It was a present. Please, put it back--

45:38.610 --> 45:39.695
Listen to me!

45:40.821 --> 45:41.989
You should never have come here.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.367
(crying) I love everybody!

45:45.451 --> 45:46.869
Quiet! Don't talk.

45:46.952 --> 45:47.995
Unit's downstairs.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.039
-You take him.
-Midtown?

45:51.582 --> 45:53.584
County General psychiatric, I'll meet you.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.921
Okay. This way, Mr. Scripps.

45:58.380 --> 45:59.214
Cuff him.

46:13.645 --> 46:16.648
"On your graduation, 1964.
Love, Mother and Father."

46:17.900 --> 46:20.778
(thunder rumbles)

46:31.997 --> 46:32.831
FRANK: Mike?

46:34.124 --> 46:35.250
Captain Furillo.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.836
It's good to see you, sir.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.923
I want to thank you
for seeing my son today.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.008
-Maria told me.
-Oh, I was glad to do it.

46:44.802 --> 46:45.761
I'm very grateful.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.681
Well, I understand that we have
a new mayor this evening.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.141
Mm-hmm.

46:51.683 --> 46:52.601
Ozzie Cleveland.

46:53.685 --> 46:54.561
Well, that's good.

46:55.521 --> 46:57.105
It'll be good for cops, for all of us.

46:57.773 --> 47:00.192
Yeah. Yeah, I think it will be.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.111
I'm coming back, Captain.

47:03.195 --> 47:04.988
I want you to know
I'm not gonna let you down.

47:05.614 --> 47:06.490
You never did, Mike.

47:07.157 --> 47:07.991
Well, they, um...

47:08.534 --> 47:09.993
they want me to stay here a few more days,

47:10.077 --> 47:12.538
but I told them
I want to get back to work.

47:12.621 --> 47:13.580
I'm ready.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.417
Well, we want you back
as soon as you feel up to it.

47:18.544 --> 47:20.712
I feel good. I feel good.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.422
You tell everybody I feel all right.

47:23.298 --> 47:24.258
They'll be glad to hear that.

47:25.384 --> 47:26.635
Yeah, yeah. I feel all right.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.180
Except, well, I... I don't know.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.849
It's just the strangest thing.

47:33.976 --> 47:36.311
-What's that?
-Where he grabbed me.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.397
I can still feel his hands here.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.691
I can feel him holding my leg.

47:41.483 --> 47:42.818
He did that after I shot him.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.112
I just can't seem to shake him.

47:46.029 --> 47:46.864
It itches.

47:48.490 --> 47:49.533
Kind of burns a little.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.953
I just don't understand it. Do you?

47:53.036 --> 47:54.746
Can feel his fingers, and, uh...

47:57.082 --> 47:58.625
It's just the strangest thing.

48:33.118 --> 48:35.662
(closing theme playing)
