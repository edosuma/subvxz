WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:03.737
(passengers cheering)

00:03.771 --> 00:05.373
As you can see, motorists are

00:05.406 --> 00:07.041
in a celebratory mood today

00:07.075 --> 00:08.776
as the speed limit here
on Willis Road

00:08.809 --> 00:12.580
switches from 25 back to
its original 30 miles an hour.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.815
Nobody is more excited
about this switch

00:14.848 --> 00:16.750
than these two commuters.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.486
It's a great day
to be an American.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.520
It sure is.

00:19.553 --> 00:20.688
Boy, you two are adorable.

00:20.721 --> 00:21.622
How long you been married?

00:21.655 --> 00:23.491
She's not my wife.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.293
She's my mother.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.595
Sorry, it's just the-the...

00:27.628 --> 00:29.297
the matching jackets
threw me.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.066
Mom, I told you people
would think we were a couple!

00:32.100 --> 00:33.301
Oh, boy.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.502
Got to get my mom
out of my house

00:34.535 --> 00:35.369
or that's my future.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.139
Me and my mom spooning
on a giant trike.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.540
(laughs)

00:39.573 --> 00:41.209
Not enjoying living
with your mom, huh?

00:41.242 --> 00:42.376
Last night I had to teach her

00:42.410 --> 00:44.278
how to search for things
on the Internet.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.347
Okay, Mom, so this is Bing.
Uh-huh.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.815
You just, you just type what you
need in that little box there.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.251
Ooh, this is so exciting!

00:50.284 --> 00:51.552
(laughs)

00:51.585 --> 00:54.822
"Hi, Bing.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.458
My name is Carol Miller."

00:57.491 --> 00:59.393
Oh, no, no, no, you know
what, you don't need to...
"I'm recently single

00:59.427 --> 01:02.296
and living with my son,
who is also recently divorced."

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
You just need
a keyword, Mom.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.200
There's nothing wrong
with being polite.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.137
"Sorry. That was my son.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.272
"Anyway, can you tell me

01:11.305 --> 01:14.875
"where a divorcée
in her early 60s

01:14.908 --> 01:18.612
would go to purchase
a... bikini wax?"

01:21.149 --> 01:24.118
"PS-- It has been a while."

01:28.622 --> 01:30.558
And tomorrow, since
she doesn't drive,

01:30.591 --> 01:32.226
I get the pleasure
of taking her

01:32.260 --> 01:33.561
to a waxing establishment

01:33.594 --> 01:35.863
called Rio de No Hairo.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.832
How about your sister--
she can't take her?

01:38.866 --> 01:40.568
I don't want to ask.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.136
I mean, she's already
got enough on her plate

01:42.170 --> 01:44.205
with my dad living with her.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.873
Debbie, you can't leave

01:45.906 --> 01:46.907
the towels on the floor.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.243
They get dirty
and feel scratchy.

01:49.277 --> 01:50.478
That's a rug, Dad.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.481
Oh.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.149
Never mind.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.252
You know what?

01:58.286 --> 02:00.188
I'll take your mom
to her appointment.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.690
Seriously?
Yeah, I'm due for
a waxing anyway.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.425
If I don't get my feet done
every couple of months,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.160
I start to look
like a black Hobbit.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.262
My sister used
to call me "Brodo."

02:08.296 --> 02:10.564
Anyway, well... listen...
I just can't wait

02:10.598 --> 02:12.566
for this whole ordeal to be
over, my parents to make up

02:12.600 --> 02:14.368
and go back to Myrtle Beach.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.369
Make up?

02:15.403 --> 02:16.737
I thought they said they
were getting divorced.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.705
No. No, no.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.839
My parents say they're
gonna do lots of stuff,

02:18.872 --> 02:21.242
and then back out when they
find out how much it costs.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.444
Uh, swimming pool,
laser eye surgery,

02:23.477 --> 02:24.612
Girl Scout cookies.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.947
Besides they're living
out of suitcases.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.150
No, this whole thing's done
in a couple weeks, tops.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.454
My stuff finally got here.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.256
It's official.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.390
We're roomies.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.892
Couple of months, tops.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.523
And the special today
is a barley and kale soup.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.625
The kale comes
from Renfro Organic Farms

03:11.659 --> 03:13.861
just north of Richmond--
no farm machinery up there.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.330
Okay? All the soil
is tilled by mules

03:16.364 --> 03:18.932
who have been rescued
from a Mexican circus show.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.703
I think we'll have
some of that pizza.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.505
It smells great.
Yeah, actually, the pizza...

03:24.538 --> 03:26.340
I got it next door.
It's amazing.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.812
(door bell jingles)
Great job, Amber.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.282
And, Katie, don't give up
just because you suck.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.316
Okay? (laughs)

03:35.349 --> 03:36.984
See you ladies next week.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.719
(phone rings)

03:38.752 --> 03:39.953
Whispering Frog Yoga Café.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.356
Come for the yoga,
Namaste for lunch.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.624
I think I figured out a way

03:43.657 --> 03:44.825
to get Mom and Dad
back together

03:44.858 --> 03:46.260
and out of our homes.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.861
I'm on my way.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.499
I got to go to Nathan's.
Just trust me, it's worth it.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.933
Bye, Dad.
(door bell jingles)

03:52.966 --> 03:55.536
Okay, listen, Tom, if you insist
on bringing in outside food,

03:55.569 --> 03:56.770
you got to at least
just hide it

03:56.804 --> 03:57.771
in one of these
flax seed tortillas.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.807
And they are great.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.710
We get them from this battered
women's shelter outside of DC.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.412
You know, it turns out
the process

04:04.445 --> 04:06.680
of making these tortillas
is very therapeutic.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.283
You know, because all the
dough is pounded out by hand.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.485
You know, they say

04:11.519 --> 04:12.286
if you chew thoughtfully,

04:12.320 --> 04:14.555
you can almost
taste the healing.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.025
Can you, uh,
taste the healing, Tom?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.728
Tom!

04:20.761 --> 04:23.697
Can you taste the
healing, Tom?!

04:25.799 --> 04:27.601
Okay, so I've started
to sort through everything.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.037
Dad's stuff's there.
Mom's stuff's there.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.573
And the rest of this stuff
is kind of up for grabs.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.642
Oh, no, this is going to cause
a huge fight.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.745
We need to infuse this room
with some positive energy.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.447
Positive... energy.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.982
Or instead
of relying on magic...

04:43.517 --> 04:44.518
...we use every
one of these items

04:44.552 --> 04:45.853
like a little bread crumb

04:45.886 --> 04:47.621
to lead them down memory lane,

04:47.655 --> 04:49.757
and out of our houses
and back to Myrtle Beach

04:49.790 --> 04:51.058
where they belong.
Okay, I don't know, Nathan.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.059
They're pretty mad
at each other.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.961
I don't think... Oh, look!

04:53.994 --> 04:57.831
Oh, it's us eating ice cream
at Happy McGee's.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.833
We'd go every Friday night,
try to finish The Kitchen Sink,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.435
so we could get it for free.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.837
Aw, we were so happy and...

05:03.871 --> 05:06.540
Oh, my God, this could work.
Yeah.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.875
It has to.
Mom's been using my face towels

05:07.908 --> 05:09.743
to freshen up her under-boob.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.546
Hey, our stuff!

05:12.580 --> 05:13.847
My stuff!

05:13.881 --> 05:15.749
We need needle nose pliers.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.751
Uh, there's a tool drawer
in the kitchen.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.052
Yeah, what happened?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.253
Well, your father got tired
of listening to me,

05:20.287 --> 05:22.990
so he shoved a chunk of flax
seed tortilla into his ears.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.560
Not every menu item
deserves a backstory.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.563
Well!
(both laughing)

05:29.597 --> 05:30.698
And it's called
"The Snake," see?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.900
Ooh, yeah, ooh...

05:32.933 --> 05:34.568
(laughing)

05:34.602 --> 05:36.570
You got it, you got it.
Ooh, yeah!

05:36.604 --> 05:39.407
Debbie, next time we do
a spa day, you should join us.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.875
Yeah, I'm in.
What did you have done?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.677
Well, I was supposed
to get a bikini wax,

05:43.711 --> 05:46.113
but it turned
into more of a consultation.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.020
Unless I want to pay double,

05:53.053 --> 05:55.122
I have some work
to do on my own.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.660
Wow, look at all this stuff.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.928
A papasan chair?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.463
And look at this bookshelf!

06:02.496 --> 06:04.932
Somebody had a gift
for sponge painting.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.166
Guilty.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.935
(laughs)

06:07.968 --> 06:09.970
Well, I got the tortilla
out of his ear.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.740
I also found a wadded up
toll booth receipt.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.508
On the drive up
from Myrtle Beach,

06:14.542 --> 06:15.909
I shoved that in there when
your mother wouldn't shut up

06:15.943 --> 06:18.111
about me taking the toll road.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.680
(clears throat)
Listen, um,

06:19.713 --> 06:21.148
Mom and Dad, so I've, uh,

06:21.181 --> 06:22.983
divided up what is
clearly yours

06:23.016 --> 06:23.817
and as far
as the rest of it goes

06:23.851 --> 06:25.419
I thought you would
start taking turns

06:25.453 --> 06:26.920
selecting sentimental items

06:26.954 --> 06:30.190
from this collection
of-of lifetime memories, guys.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.492
Whoever ends up
with this afghan

06:31.525 --> 06:33.894
should know
my birthday's coming up.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.429
Ray...
Okay, Dad?

06:35.463 --> 06:37.431
Dad, why don't you start us off?
Yeah.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.473
Nah, I'm good.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.874
Wait, what?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

06:46.907 --> 06:47.908
Wait, wait, Dad,
what are you doing?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.042
Where you going?
You barely looked.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.778
Come on, if you don't
grab something,

06:50.811 --> 06:51.845
Mom's gonna end up with...

06:51.879 --> 06:53.914
with your wedding album, huh?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.883
Look at this--
oh, look at you guys.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.884
Look at you dancing.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.887
Look how high Mom threw you.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.856
You know what?
I don't want any of it, either.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.658
There's too many bad memories.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.226
If I never see
that seashell lamp again

07:06.259 --> 07:07.895
it will be too soon.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.730
It was on our night stand.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.699
Every time we had sex,
your mother used to knock

07:11.732 --> 07:13.601
a bunch of shells off it
with her foot.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.969
Looks like it's
in pretty good shape to me.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.505
Yup.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.939
Look, come on, you guys.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.841
You can't just walk away
from all of this stuff.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.076
I mean, look at, look at this!

07:23.110 --> 07:25.746
Look at this caricature of
you guys from Ocean City.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.982
Look at what a, what
a pair of fun-loving

07:29.016 --> 07:30.918
big-headed individuals you are.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.721
Yeah, or, uh, Bosco the cat!

07:33.754 --> 07:35.789
You guys,
your first pet together!

07:35.823 --> 07:36.924
Remember, he had
the cutest meow?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.926
It sounded
like he was saying bacon.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.794
I hated that cat.
It was always getting me

07:40.828 --> 07:41.929
in the mood for bacon,

07:41.962 --> 07:43.664
which your mother
wouldn't let me eat.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.533
"Macon."

07:45.566 --> 07:47.535
"No bacon."
"Macon."

07:47.568 --> 07:49.169
"No bacon."

07:49.202 --> 07:51.739
What about this photo
from Happy McGee's?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.106
Remember we'd order
The Kitchen Sink?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.908
Nathan, we don't want any of it.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.578
Ray, if you like
this stuff so much

07:57.611 --> 07:59.046
you can have it.
NATHAN:
Wait a second.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.814
Mom, you can't just
give it away.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.183
Hey, I agree. I
don't want charity.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.886
Know what?
Throw in the TV/VCR combo,

08:05.919 --> 08:08.622
and I'll give you 13 bucks
for the whole shebang.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.891
Sold!

08:10.924 --> 08:12.025
Okay, look, you know what?
Maybe this was a mistake

08:12.059 --> 08:13.761
to start splitting
this stuff up

08:13.794 --> 08:15.763
when emotions
are still so fresh,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.898
so why don't we just put
everything into storage?

08:17.931 --> 08:18.899
I'm not gonna
pay money

08:18.932 --> 08:20.768
to store all this crap.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.703
We don't need any of it.

08:22.736 --> 08:23.937
We're getting divorced.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.272
Whoa. Whoa,
whoa, whoa. Let's...
Mom...

08:25.305 --> 08:28.008
let's not start
throwing the D-word around.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.277
Nobody's actually
divorced yet.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.145
We will be soon.
Your mother found some forms

08:32.179 --> 08:33.681
on the Internet.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.617
I just need to figure out
how to print.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.218
Whoa, but if you actually
get divorced

08:38.251 --> 08:39.987
that means this is permanent.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.155
Mom and Dad apart.
Mom living with Nathan.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.857
Dad living with...

08:43.891 --> 08:45.325
Positive energy,

08:45.358 --> 08:47.661
positive energy,
positive energy.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.162
(exhales)

08:49.196 --> 08:51.699
She's an odd bird that one.

08:51.732 --> 08:56.336
I never should've run that
marathon when I was pregnant.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.338
Is she? Is she the odd one?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.808
'Cause I think the odd ones
are the two people

09:00.841 --> 09:03.677
who can stand here
in front of 43 years of memories

09:03.711 --> 09:06.313
and not do what I had hoped!

09:08.115 --> 09:09.950
If anyone should understand,
it's you.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.218
You just got
divorced.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.319
We're doing
the same thing you are.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.022
We're just trying to move
forward and start fresh

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
with our separate lives.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.159
Only we're not all
that separate, are we?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.962
Dad's living with Debbie.
You're living with me.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.865
Everything is upside down
and sideways!

09:24.898 --> 09:27.134
My face smells like under-boob!

09:27.167 --> 09:29.102
Things are a mess!

09:36.143 --> 09:39.046
You saw how upset Nathan
and Debbie were yesterday.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.348
Our divorce is obviously
taking a toll on them.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.349
I think they're fine.

09:42.382 --> 09:46.019
Yeah, well, you thought
Silly Putty was edible.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.988
I ate it, I passed it,
I'm still here.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.290
It's edible.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.093
I know my children.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.028
We need to
deal with this.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.764
So let's just
talk to them.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.899
Why do we need the computer?
I want to get

09:58.932 --> 10:01.168
some professional advice
on what to say.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.171
Look, we were married
for 43 years.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.707
15 were happy, five we drank

10:06.740 --> 10:08.642
and the next 23 years

10:08.676 --> 10:11.779
we spent mentally preparing
for this divorce.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.816
That's true. I used to doodle
your maiden name on napkins.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.087
We were ready,
but our kids got blindsided.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.122
We need to deal
with this better.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.092
Fine.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.060
"Divorce, kids,

10:27.094 --> 10:29.062
what to say."

10:29.096 --> 10:30.130
What are you, a caveman?

10:30.163 --> 10:32.700
"Divorce, kids, me make fire."

10:32.733 --> 10:34.234
Give me that.
(groans)

10:34.267 --> 10:38.171
If you want to get a good
answer, you need to be polite.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.973
"Hello, Bing.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.909
"It's Carol again.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.912
"Anyway, I was wondering if you

10:44.945 --> 10:47.380
"or anyone in your office

10:47.414 --> 10:50.250
has been through a divorce
and has children."

10:50.283 --> 10:53.053
Now I hit Enter,
they discuss things

10:53.086 --> 10:55.756
and they get back to me.
Yeah.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.191
Ooh. That was fast.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.194
Must not be busy there today.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.432
Well, they warned us.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.168
Thanks to a couple lead-footed
Leesburgians,

11:08.201 --> 11:12.139
the daily commute down
Willis Road just got longer.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.140
(phone rings)

11:13.173 --> 11:15.876
Hang on one second.
Hang on.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.010
Oh, it's my dad.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.011
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.013
Ask if they have
the remote to their old TV/VCR.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.348
Hey, Dad.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.783
It's Mom and Dad.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.683
Hi.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.452
Why are you calling
from the same number?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.887
Are you trapped
under a bookcase?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.490
It's no big deal that both of us
are calling.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.060
"Just because there have been
some big changes

11:33.093 --> 11:37.097
"in all our lives doesn't mean
there aren't going

11:37.130 --> 11:40.167
to be some constants
that remain the same."

11:40.200 --> 11:42.102
Clear your throat
if there's somebody there

11:42.135 --> 11:43.170
with a gun to your head.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.905
Nathan, stop it.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.040
Your father and I want
to get together tonight

11:47.074 --> 11:50.077
with you and Debbie,
just the four of us.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.012
We want to take you
to Happy McGee's.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.081
That Irish ice cream place
we love so much.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.084
Yeah, I'm familiar.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.085
Okay.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.519
Oh, great!

11:59.552 --> 12:01.221
BOTH:
See you tonight.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.123
Huh.

12:03.156 --> 12:03.991
What?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.859
My mom and dad
are hanging out together,

12:05.893 --> 12:07.995
they want to take Debbie
and me for ice cream.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.930
Maybe showing them
their old stuff worked.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.499
They might make up and move back
to Myrtle Beach.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.267
(chuckles)
That'd be great.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.169
I'll miss your Mom, though.
Nice lady.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.071
She held my hand
while they waxed my feet.

12:18.105 --> 12:21.174
You ever felt hair being pulled
out of your pinkie toe?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.210
Ah! Mm!

12:23.243 --> 12:27.114
Poor Brodo felt
the Lord of the Stings.

12:29.216 --> 12:32.920
Do you really think
Mom and Dad are getting
back together?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.288
Boy, I hope so. Last night,
I walked in on Mom

12:35.322 --> 12:37.290
using my cheese grater
to shave down her bunions.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.228
Okay, here they come!
Here they come!

12:41.261 --> 12:42.362
Enough complaining.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.730
Tonight's about positive energy

12:43.763 --> 12:48.001
to bring them back
together and move them
farther away from us.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.269
(door bell jingles)

12:49.302 --> 12:52.172
You slammed on
the brakes on purpose.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.142
Yep. Cross that off
the bucket list.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.476
Oh, there they are.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.446
Just remember, we have
to show the kids

12:59.479 --> 13:03.183
we can still be a happy family
even in the face of divorce.

13:03.216 --> 13:06.153
Hey!
BOTH:
Hey!

13:06.186 --> 13:07.187
Hey, hey!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.221
Hey, Mom!

13:08.255 --> 13:09.990
We got our favorite table!

13:10.023 --> 13:11.258
Our favorite table!

13:11.291 --> 13:12.225
We ordered
The Kitchen Sink.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.994
Just like the old days.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.328
A family project!
Yeah!

13:15.362 --> 13:16.964
This is gonna be fun!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.198
Oh, yeah!

13:18.231 --> 13:20.567
(all laughing)

13:20.600 --> 13:22.235
Oh, watch out!
Here comes the brain freeze!

13:22.269 --> 13:26.306
(all laugh)

13:26.339 --> 13:29.076
All right, here
are some napkins, all right?
Uh-huh.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.879
And we're required to give you
this pamphlet about diabetes,

13:31.912 --> 13:34.982
which most people end up using
as an extra napkin.

13:36.116 --> 13:40.921
Okay, you got 20 minutes
or you owe us $60.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.122
We know the rules.
Don't worry.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.457
This lady's not gonna be paying
60 bucks for ice cream.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.126
I'm incredibly cheap.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.563
Oh, wow!

13:50.597 --> 13:52.299
Okay.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.868
So, your father
and I were wondering

13:54.902 --> 13:59.639
if either of you want
to maybe talk about the divorce?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.075
Why?

14:02.109 --> 14:04.878
Having, uh, having regrets?

14:04.912 --> 14:06.379
A few. We didn't handle
things very well.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.348
You know, your father

14:08.381 --> 14:10.117
and I love you
both very much.

14:10.150 --> 14:10.817
Mm-hmm.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.219
You will always have
two people

14:12.252 --> 14:16.056
who support you
unconditionally.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.358
"This separation
is no one's fault.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.660
Especially not yours."

14:20.693 --> 14:23.663
Wait-- did you bring us here

14:23.696 --> 14:25.565
to retell us
about the divorce?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.367
Well, the first time
was so mismanaged,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.369
we wanted to take
another crack at it.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.438
So, you're not getting
back together?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.206
(both laugh)

14:34.441 --> 14:37.210
Good God, no.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.213
And you took us out
for ice cream to break the news?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.382
We're not children.
We can handle the divorce.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.317
Yeah, we just want you
out of our houses.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.519
Your house?
Last I checked,

14:46.553 --> 14:48.621
we own your
house, Debbie.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.258
And, Nathan, we let you live
with us for 18 years.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.392
Three of which

14:52.425 --> 14:54.694
you thought you were gonna
be a professional rapper.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.931
I was an MC.

14:57.965 --> 15:00.233
A sucka MC.

15:00.267 --> 15:03.536
Tom, relax.
They don't really care
about us living with them.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.238
Remember what we read?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.674
They're masking their
true emotions about the divorce.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.509
No, no, no. We don't care
about the divorce.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.279
What I care about
is a search history on my laptop

15:12.312 --> 15:15.448
that includes, "bikini wax,"
and "sex over 60,"

15:15.482 --> 15:18.651
and for some reason, "any photo
of Chuck Woolery shirtless."

15:18.685 --> 15:23.023
There's one out there
and I'm gonna find it.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.558
At least you don't have to deal
with pulling things out of Dad.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.394
Yesterday, Adam got
a tortilla out his ear.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.230
Last week,
I pulled a pen cap
out of his nose.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.398
I'm running out of holes

15:31.431 --> 15:33.166
I'm willing
to take stuff out of, Dad!

15:33.200 --> 15:36.403
I can't believe
the two of you are
so ungrateful.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.405
Your mother and I devoted
our whole lives

15:38.438 --> 15:40.340
to taking care of you!

15:40.373 --> 15:43.310
And you're acting
like brats just like
when you were kids!

15:43.343 --> 15:45.745
No wonder our marriage
caved in on itself!

15:45.778 --> 15:46.746
Wait a minute.

15:46.779 --> 15:52.119
Are you-are you blaming us
for this divorce?

15:53.153 --> 15:54.487
"No."

15:57.690 --> 16:00.327
You idiot, that's number one
on the list:

16:00.360 --> 16:01.428
"Don't blame the kids."

16:01.461 --> 16:03.296
Yeah, well,
the list is right!

16:03.330 --> 16:05.132
Don't blame us!
Blame yourselves!

16:05.165 --> 16:06.566
Everything we had
is gone! Guess what?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
No more happy trips
to Happy McGee's!

16:08.601 --> 16:10.037
Now it's just McGee's.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.604
All because you two
couldn't get along!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.040
Well, guess what?!

16:13.073 --> 16:15.308
This is not the way
it's supposed to be!

16:15.342 --> 16:17.610
Mommies and daddies are supposed
to stay together!

16:17.644 --> 16:21.048
Oh, my God, I do care
about this divorce!

16:21.081 --> 16:23.016
I'm the only person left
in this family

16:23.050 --> 16:24.451
in a successful marriage!

16:24.484 --> 16:25.518
That's too much pressure!

16:25.552 --> 16:28.121
Debbie, I know
this is hard,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.223
but you're gonna have
to keep eating

16:30.257 --> 16:31.791
or we're gonna lose
the $60.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.127
How can you be concerned
about finishing ice cream

16:34.161 --> 16:36.029
when you won't even finish
your own marriage?!

16:36.063 --> 16:38.065
Somebody put these bananas
in your pockets!

16:38.098 --> 16:41.634
Carol! Carol,
Carol!

16:41.668 --> 16:44.204
Carol, you're acting
like a lunatic!

16:44.237 --> 16:46.606
And you're ruining
the purse I gave
you last Christmas!

16:46.639 --> 16:49.642
You found it on a bus!

16:49.676 --> 16:51.711
It was a
Christmas miracle!

16:53.346 --> 16:55.148
Say "Happy McGee's"!

16:55.182 --> 16:57.650
Happy McGee's!

16:59.419 --> 17:01.621
(knocking)
I'm coming.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.625
How'd it go?

17:05.658 --> 17:07.227
Well, they're still
getting divorced.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.795
And we got charged double
for cheating.

17:08.828 --> 17:11.064
Sorry to hear that, buddy.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.432
Yeah. Anyway, we were
feeling nostalgic and

17:12.465 --> 17:14.234
couldn't find our box
of home movies.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.468
Did you take it
by mistake?

17:15.502 --> 17:18.138
Take it? I bought it.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.439
We said whole shebang,
not part-shebang.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.075
You can't have
our home movies, Ray.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.344
Come on, man.
That's my new favorite TV show--

17:24.377 --> 17:26.813
The Millers.
Been watching them all day.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.549
I'm in the middle
of the part

17:29.582 --> 17:31.751
where your father loses
Debbie at the water park.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.420
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I remember that.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.654
I was actually just...

17:34.687 --> 17:37.357
La, la, la, la, la!
Don't ruin it for me!

17:37.390 --> 17:38.591
All right,
where are they?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.560
They're on the bookshelf
next to your photos

17:40.593 --> 17:42.595
and half your dead cat.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.464
Yeah, took a little tumble
down the stairs.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.299
I should have made two trips.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.300
Hey, check it out.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.303
This one's... this one's called
"Happy McGee's."

17:50.337 --> 17:52.139
Oh, that's a good one.
Pop it in.

17:52.172 --> 17:52.839
All right.

17:54.607 --> 17:58.278
No word on
my remote, huh?

17:58.311 --> 18:01.114
I keep forgetting to ask.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.619
Nathan Miller reporting
from the final minutes

18:06.653 --> 18:08.421
of the sports event
of the summer:

18:08.455 --> 18:11.524
The Millers versus
Happy McGee's Kitchen Sink.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.526
See? Look at that sweet family.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.595
It's heartbreaking.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.497
Less than two minutes left.
How you feeling, Dad?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.332
This is stupid!
It's too much ice cream!

18:19.366 --> 18:20.467
Why are they offering
this promotion?!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.868
I'll tell you
who's stupid?

18:21.901 --> 18:23.670
It's the idiot who lets his
eight-year-old daughter

18:23.703 --> 18:25.872
order dessert while
I was in the bathroom!

18:25.905 --> 18:27.607
I thought
it would be fun!

18:27.640 --> 18:29.442
It's not fun!

18:29.476 --> 18:32.479
Nathan, put down that damn
microphone and grab a spoon!

18:32.512 --> 18:35.248
This is your college money
melting in front of us!

18:35.282 --> 18:36.716
Say "Happy McGee's"!

18:36.749 --> 18:39.286
Happy McGee's!

18:39.319 --> 18:41.521
Man, I seem to remember
us being more much more

18:41.554 --> 18:42.622
fun-loving back then.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.756
Yeah, me, too.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.593
Nope. Every episode's
like that.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.497
Tom says something dumb.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.631
Carol gets mad.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.899
Everybody starts screaming.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.801
It's a formula, but it works.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.506
I guess since Mom and
Dad have been living

18:59.539 --> 19:00.773
in Myrtle Beach
the last decade,

19:00.807 --> 19:02.542
we forgot what our
family was really like.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.411
Yeah, we're not losing
what we always had,

19:04.444 --> 19:06.513
because that is
what we always had.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.614
Uh-huh.
Got to say...

19:07.647 --> 19:09.249
that made me feel
a lot better.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.251
Yeah, yeah,
me, too.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.619
Plus, now when
they fight,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.487
we don't have to put up
with the makeup sex.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.756
(groans)
The makeup sex.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.891
I had almost erased that
from my memory, too.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.627
They had this vicious cycle
of fighting

19:20.660 --> 19:22.562
and then trying
to make it better with sex.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.464
Yeah, I don't know what they did
in their bedroom,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.666
but it involved a lot
of grunting and shushing.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.501
Uh, shh, uh, shh, uh, shh, uh.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.802
Yeah, it sounded
like two dudes

19:29.836 --> 19:32.839
shoveling gravel.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.242
RAY: Wow.
Oh, and then Mom would come out
the next morning

19:35.275 --> 19:37.444
whistling "I've Been Working
on the Railroad."

19:37.477 --> 19:39.279
And Dad would do
that weird twirl

19:39.312 --> 19:40.547
when he put sugar in his coffee.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.686
So maybe this divorce
is a good thing.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.555
You still have your same family

19:48.588 --> 19:52.292
minus the disturbing sounds
of old folks humping.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.261
Ah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's perfect.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.928
Yeah.
If only they didn't
live with us.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.264
No, you know what, though?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.231
Maybe Dad's right.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.467
They did take care of us,
so now it's our turn

20:00.500 --> 20:01.601
to take care of them.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.569
(chuckles)

20:02.602 --> 20:03.770
You know what?
Do me a favor.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.772
If my mom and I ever
get matching jackets,

20:05.805 --> 20:08.575
you'll smother
me in my sleep.

20:08.608 --> 20:11.344
You'll never know
it's coming.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.657
Old habits die hard.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.660
That's all I'm saying.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.562
Just to be clear, I don't
want you thinking that...

20:29.596 --> 20:30.897
You say, "That's
all I'm saying,"

20:30.930 --> 20:33.566
but you always go
right on talking.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.801
You should retire
the phrase

20:34.834 --> 20:37.737
if you don't know
how it works.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.971
I just don't want
you leaving here,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.807
thinking we're getting
back together.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.643
Never crossed
my mind.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.679
The kids can't know about this.

20:46.713 --> 20:50.850
They won't as long
as we replace this lamp.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.591

Working on the Railroad")

Nah.
