<i>Our story begins high above the clouds,</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:20.186
<i>where a young and fearless explorer</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:24.816
<i>has fashioned hundreds of balloons</i>
<i>onto a basket to take her up, up, up.</i>

00:25.108 --> 00:26.443
<i>Well, hello there!</i>

00:26.568 --> 00:31.614
Holy... Holy Guacamole, a stowaway.
What are you doin' up here, mister?

00:31.698 --> 00:34.075
NARRATOR:<i> Well, I'm a voice,</i>
<i>I can pretty much go anywhere.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:35.660
<i>But this story is about you.</i>

00:35.785 --> 00:37.662
<i>What above the world</i>
<i>are you doing up here?</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:41.416
I didn't get my air travel innovator patch

<i>"The air travel innovator patch"?</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:44.169
<i>I must have missed that one.</i>

00:44.294 --> 00:47.672
Well, I sorta had to make
that one up myself. Sewing's hard.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.924
Stuck my finger about six bajillion times.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.887
But if it was real, you bet your whole jar
of loose change, I'd have it.

NARRATOR:
<i>You do have a heading, though, right?</i>

01:04.856 --> 01:07.567
A heading? What's that? Sounds cool.

NARRATOR:<i> Do you have any sort</i>
<i>of navigational tools?</i>

01:09.569 --> 01:11.821
My teacher at school says
the greatest tool in the world

Plus, I've heard so much about
Russell and Mr. Fredricksen's journey,

01:16.701 --> 01:18.036
I got to thinking,

01:18.244 --> 01:21.956
I haven't really been anywhere.
I wanna adventure all on my own.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.001

<i>Everyone should seek adventure.</i>

there's so many swell places to see.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.472
How do I even choose?

01:37.889 --> 01:41.351
Oh, I wish there was some way someone
could help me narrow it down.

it's <i>Up.</i>

By placing the famous floating house
from <i>Up </i>at an iconic landmark,

03:21.326 --> 03:25.038

03:25.538 --> 03:28.124
Benny and Amirah,
what's gonna impress you guys today?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.460
We'll be looking for technical ability.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.171
We want to see perfect scale and texture,

03:33.588 --> 03:36.925
the overall appearance needs
to make sense in the world of <i>Up.</i>

03:37.133 --> 03:39.177
We'll also be looking for creativity.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.179
<i>Up </i>is such an original story,

03:41.512 --> 03:44.641
I want to feel like I'm transported
into a different part of the world

03:44.724 --> 03:46.476
just by looking
at the story of your build.

will be donated to charity.

Now, before we let you all take off
into the skies and get to work,

03:56.152 --> 03:58.238
there is one more thing, that you need...

03:58.363 --> 04:00.698
Oh, no! Wait! Wait! Oh, dang!

Anyway, all trips
have a beginning and an end.

04:14.754 --> 04:19.467
This trip will be no different.
Once Carl's house crosses the sky,

04:19.717 --> 04:21.052

-Our explorer's waitin' on you.

-All right.

-We are three, strong Latina women.
-Yes!

-Latina power.
-So, we need to bring that to our project.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.407
a food art project
where we worked together

04:42.490 --> 04:44.742
and we had such a great time and got to
know each other.

04:44.826 --> 04:49.038
And recently I became aware
of Grace and her skills

04:49.122 --> 04:52.250
and was really excited to work with her
for the first time on this foodscape.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.961
You know, we have to put
the <i>Up</i> house in here.

04:55.044 --> 04:59.215
I wanna make it gravity-defying.
So, we're going to put a big tree

04:59.340 --> 05:01.884
-at the front of our piece.
-TEAM MEMBERS: Oh!

05:02.010 --> 05:04.554
And then we're going to use
that structure to have the house on there.

05:04.637 --> 05:08.057
MARY CARMEN: I'm gonna start
with Rosita guiding our scout through

05:08.141 --> 05:11.853
the history of Mexico,
because she's going to represent the past,

05:12.020 --> 05:14.397
-the present, and the future
-SABRINA: I love that.

05:14.522 --> 05:18.109

<i>explorer on a magical tour of Mexico.</i>

05:18.192 --> 05:21.779
<i>And on the path</i>
<i>towards </i>El Castillo<i> and Chichén Itzá,</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:24.657
<i>you'll see markers</i>
<i>of Mexican culture along the way.</i>

05:24.866 --> 05:26.868
And all of these things tied together

with all of the foods and ingredients
that make Mexico wonderful.

<i>for our young scout, as Mount Rushmore,</i>
<i>on the Fourth of July.</i>

05:36.878 --> 05:39.547
KETURAH:<i> Yeah, and then we can</i>
<i>add fireworks exploding up top.</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:41.090
-NOLAN: <i>Yes.</i>
-KETURAH:<i> And clouds in front of them.</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:44.052
Okay, so for the boulders, we need
to build up the structure...

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
-Yeah.
-...because it's not just the heads.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.805
<i>I'm really excited</i>
<i>about building Mount Rushmore because</i>

05:48.014 --> 05:51.309
<i>when I was in seventh grade,</i>
<i>my family and I stopped at Mount Rushmore</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:56.856
and I'll never forget walking up
and seeing these 20-foot-tall faces carved

05:56.939 --> 06:00.234
into the side of a mountain
and I think for every artist out there,

06:00.318 --> 06:03.946
it's just unbelievably beautiful
portrait of our presidents.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.199
-KETURAH: So excited.
-We've never done something this big.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.618
And the fact
that we're able to do the <i>Up </i>movie...

06:08.743 --> 06:10.119
-NOLAN: Yeah.
-...it's literally the one thing

06:10.203 --> 06:12.747
we bonded over when we first met.
So, that's awesome.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.374
MAYEN: We're gonna go
to the Philippines,

06:14.457 --> 06:17.085
and we're going to choose
an iconic place like the Mayon Volcano.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.252
-That will be good.
-Okay, sounds good.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.255
MAYEN: <i>So, the tricky part of our build</i>
<i>is the size of the volcano.</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:22.715
JOANNE:<i> It's gonna be, like, eight by 12.</i>

06:22.840 --> 06:24.342
MAYEN:<i> It doesn't make sense</i>
<i>to make it out of cake.</i>

06:24.425 --> 06:28.429
JOANNE: <i>Sheets of rice paper,</i>
<i>and then we layer them on with bread.</i>

06:28.638 --> 06:33.059
The scale of the balloons,
how can we make that more realistic?

06:33.684 --> 06:37.230
-We'll put a topiary of citrus.
-I like that.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.108

-Yes, yes...
-Okay.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.400

09:35.032 --> 09:36.659
-AMIRAH: Wow!
-KEKE: I think you said something

09:36.742 --> 09:38.327
about making rainbow tamales.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.537
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

09:39.704 --> 09:41.497
-She's a psychic.
-(LAUGHS)

09:41.581 --> 09:42.873

09:42.957 --> 09:45.209
By the end of all this,
she's gonna be bilingual.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.044
-I mean, she already is. She already is.
-Uh-huh, I'm ready.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.171
-(LAUGHS)
-So, what is this?

09:49.380 --> 09:52.592
This is our jaguar,
and after his head is formed,

09:52.758 --> 09:53.718
I'm going to decorate

09:54.218 --> 09:55.636
-like <i>alebrije </i>style.
-Got it.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.097
So, all these elements
are looking so beautiful.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.058
But as much as I love Mexico,
I want to see an <i>Up</i> house.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.269
This build will be nothing
without an <i>Up</i> house.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.814
-So, let's get those balloons floating.
-Chop, chop, people! Chop, chop!

10:06.939 --> 10:08.441

-All right.

NOLAN: <i>We need to show</i>
<i>the wilderness explorer</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:16.407
<i>the magic of Mount Rushmore.</i>

10:17.283 --> 10:20.411
<i>I'm a vegetable carver.</i>
<i>I got into pumpkin carving</i>

10:20.536 --> 10:22.913
<i>when I was just graduated from college.</i>

10:23.039 --> 10:25.833
Every year I get so excited,
I don't even wait for pumpkin season,

10:25.958 --> 10:27.460
like, I grow my own squashes,

10:27.585 --> 10:28.919
<i>and then when it comes time for the fall,</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:31.464
<i>I'm carving like 30 Pumpkins.</i>
<i>But with Mount Rushmore,</i>

10:31.547 --> 10:36.844
<i>it's such a massive sculpture that we have</i>
<i>to use primarily rice cereal treats.</i>

10:37.595 --> 10:39.263
The reason that I'm putting it
in the bucket

10:39.347 --> 10:42.266
is because this is
kind of an innovative idea of Keturah's

10:42.350 --> 10:45.311
to really compact it down,
and get a basis of the head

10:45.436 --> 10:48.189
rather than trying to mix
and make these all from scratch.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.525
<i>But trying some new things</i>
<i>and innovating for this competition</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:53.653
<i>is kind of a fun thing</i>
<i>that we're all looking forward to.</i>

10:53.778 --> 10:59.116
You work really subtractive, it's funny,
'cause I usually build things, like...

10:59.200 --> 11:01.577
-You're adding on.
-...adding layers so, it's nice,

11:01.702 --> 11:03.079
I'm getting into your world.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.623
NOLAN:<i> We can't have</i>
<i>this head falling apart at all...</i>

11:05.706 --> 11:07.375
-Woah!
<i>-...because it's the basis</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:08.793
<i>of our entire sculpture.</i>

11:09.835 --> 11:11.003
Man, that's awesome.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.798
-Teddy's repping that mustache.
-SAMIRA: I know.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.008
-I like... you got his eyebrows, too.
-SAMIRA: I'm trying...

11:16.092 --> 11:17.385
-That's awesome.
-...to make him extra angry.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.804
As a little girl I always wanted
to be a world traveler,

11:20.137 --> 11:23.099
<i>and I heard about people working</i>
<i>on cruise ships as a chef,</i>

11:23.224 --> 11:26.352
<i>and I applied, got hired,</i>
<i>and went on the ship right away.</i>

11:26.477 --> 11:29.772
That was my dream, was world traveling
and learning all those things.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.359
Okay, Best Coasters, I mean, I gotta say
I didn't know you was gonna get

11:33.567 --> 11:35.861
-on the faces that quick.
-(TEAM CHUCKLES)

11:35.986 --> 11:38.572
I mean, I came over here and I was like,
"Hey, George. Hey, Lincoln."

11:38.698 --> 11:40.825
AMIRAH: We have the faces,
and we have the trees,

11:40.950 --> 11:43.411
-but talk to me about the house.
-I already did the walls and panels to it.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.955
I just have to let it
dry out a little bit.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.457
The more it's dried out,
the more stable it is.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.876
BENNY: I see a huge block
of rice cereal treat.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.254
Is there something inside
underneath of that?

11:53.379 --> 11:56.215
Yeah, on the bottom if we lift up
you can see there's an armature

11:56.340 --> 11:58.008
that we're gonna attach and thread it in.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.929
The recipe we use is literally just
marshmallow puff and rice cereal.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.765
And so, this is like
the food version of foam.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.601
I just want to make sure because sometimes
when you create a lot of...

12:07.685 --> 12:11.188
Like for example, a bowl of rice cereal,
it tends to kind of, like,

12:11.439 --> 12:12.690
-separate.
-Hmm.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.692
BENNY: That could be
a recipe for disaster.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.325
JOANNE: <i>We're working on the volcano</i>
<i>and the layers of the food,</i>

12:23.868 --> 12:28.330

<i>how it's going to be.</i>

12:28.539 --> 12:31.417
<i>I've heard lots of stories from my mother.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:34.795
Her happy times near the Mayon Volcano.

12:34.879 --> 12:40.551
And I know in my heart
that she would want me to pursue this.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.678
And not really dwell on grieving.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.138
-Mayen?
-Yeah.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.141
JOANNE: You have to help me out
figure this bread collage.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.351
<i>The bread doesn't have any character.</i>

12:49.435 --> 12:53.272
<i>I tried using chocolate</i>
<i>to fill up some gaps.</i>

12:53.439 --> 12:55.941
<i>But it's still as bare as it can be.</i>

12:56.066 --> 12:59.111
MAYEN: I think we can add
some more height.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.155
Like, if we did like a...

13:01.447 --> 13:02.573
a mixture.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.826
The volcano is a little flat,
so we're gonna add some textures.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.662
MAYEN: We will use up so much time
if everything was bread.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.415
There's other stuff that we can use.
Like, what if we would mix it?

13:11.665 --> 13:17.671
JOANNE: <i>By layering rice, beans,</i>
<i>coffee beans, cereals, and mushrooms.</i>

13:18.005 --> 13:19.840
I love mushrooms.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.676
But I don't eat mushroom.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.513
MAYEN:<i> When you look at it,</i>
<i>if you would know the reason behind it,</i>

13:25.721 --> 13:26.806
<i>it would all make sense.</i>

13:26.889 --> 13:28.182
Because it is a foodscape.

13:28.265 --> 13:32.561
They have to know that it's craisins,
that it's beans.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.563
-That it's...
-MYTON: Uh, a food item.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.233

has been holding really well.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.037
-See how like it's plastic?
-JOANNE: It's plastic now.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.705
-Oh, that's great.
-MAYEN: Uh-huh.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.041
And I see some color.
Are you guys airbrushing?

13:54.124 --> 13:55.417
-MAYEN: Yeah, we did it some.
-Yeah, okay.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.505
-This is the side... experimental side.
-BENNY: So, you're giving us broccoli,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.131
-grapes, bread.
-Grapes.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.259

-Cereals.

-We're giving you a farmers market, Benny.
-Mushrooms.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.516
BENNY: I love textures,
but sometimes we have to find a balance.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.018
Try to make sure
that it doesn't look too messy.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.562
-Yes.
-BENNY: That's really important.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.647
Yes, yes. Thanks.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.370
they're very heavy.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.540
To be able to support these heads,
we need to add more armature.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.293
Let's not spend too much time
because I need to put these things in.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.920

Yeah. Once, it starts drying and stuff,

-MARY CARMEN: Mexico! Okay, Mexico!
-SABRINA: Okay, let's go.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.884
-Let's go, let's go.
-MARY CARMEN: Let's go.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.053
-SAMIRA: We got South Dakota?
-NOLAN: South Dakota.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.847
-Oh, that's cool, let's go.
-Oh, okay. Let's go.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.141
-SAMIRA: Got it?
-NOLAN: Got it.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.725
MARY CARMEN: Okay.
Where do you wanna put it?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.561
-SABRINA: Here.
-All right, so what did we get?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.771
-MAYEN: We got <i>sotanghon.</i>
-JOANNE: <i>Bihon, bihon.</i>

19:07.938 --> 19:09.565
<i>-Bihon?</i> Yeah.
<i>-Ube.</i>

19:09.773 --> 19:11.108
-No,<i> Ube halaya.</i>
<i>-Halaya.</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:15.070
-And this, uh, <i>gabi</i> which is a root crop.
<i>-Pritong isda.</i> Which is fried fish.

19:15.279 --> 19:18.323
-The banana...
-MYTON: The peel can go to the volcano.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.618
MAYEN: <i>The glass noodles</i>
<i>is perfect for the balloons.</i>

19:21.743 --> 19:26.081
<i>The taro, we will also use</i>
<i>that for the landscape as rocks.</i>

19:26.165 --> 19:27.374
-MYTON: Okay.
-MAYEN: All right, perfect.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.293
-MAYEN: So now, we get to work.
-Perfect. So, we get to work.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.919
MARY CARMEN: This is amazing.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.130
SABRINA: Since, we're taking
our wilderness explorer

19:33.213 --> 19:35.382
through our tour of Mexican culture,

19:35.507 --> 19:38.677
<i>maybe the things that can't be used</i>
<i>for the </i>ofrenda<i> can be like</i>

19:38.802 --> 19:41.054
<i>-part of our sand on the path.</i>
-GRACE: <i>Absolutely.</i>

19:41.388 --> 19:44.183
Some of the items in the box
we were already planning on using,

19:44.308 --> 19:46.685
and some of the items in the box
we were not planning on using.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.897
<i>But, before I get too far,</i>
<i>I need to now make the house.</i>

19:52.816 --> 19:55.861
<i>It is stressful, considering that we're</i>
<i>so behind where we want to be,</i>

19:55.944 --> 19:57.696
and time is just going quickly.

19:57.779 --> 20:01.450
Okay, food artists,
Carl's house is directly overhead.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.494
That means it's time
to take this thing up a notch.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.413
Good golly...

20:06.580 --> 20:09.291
I'm like way too stressed out,
I'm freaking out.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.336
<i>The ingredients in this basket</i>
<i>are representative of South Dakota.</i>

20:12.461 --> 20:17.382
<i>We have a Swiss chard, hops,</i>
<i>okra, apple pie, corn, and beef jerky.</i>

20:17.758 --> 20:20.969
<i>I'm thinking that there's no time</i>
<i>and I can't even like process</i>

20:21.094 --> 20:24.014
<i>this challenge, it's not just</i>
<i>one head going wrong, it's two.</i>

20:24.139 --> 20:26.642
<i>We're trying to figure out</i>
<i>a plan for how we fix it.</i>

20:26.934 --> 20:29.102
So, let's just set it over here,
next to our build.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.229
-KETURAH: Yes.
-And then we can...

20:30.354 --> 20:32.064
-SAMIRA: I'm gonna go back into my house.
-KETURAH: Yes.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.774
-We'll get there, I'm sorry.
-NOLAN: Yeah... No, no.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.901
-I'm just worried about that house.
-NOLAN: Don't feel... I can do this.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.903
And it's gonna be done,
but it's not going to look pretty.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.279
KETURAH: That's not good, Nolan.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.657
<i>There's a lot of things</i>
<i>going on right now.</i>

20:41.740 --> 20:44.910
<i>We have heads exploding on the counter</i>

20:45.118 --> 20:47.955
and at this point
we're looking at each other like,

20:48.121 --> 20:49.831
"Are we even gonna have a piece?"

20:51.124 --> 20:54.336
-I'll help you when I'm more through this.
-KETURAH: Levelheaded.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.340
SABRINA: Gosh, this is heavy.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.551
Our wilderness explorer
will be landing in the house,

21:01.677 --> 21:05.264
atop of a rice-cereal-treat-tree
covered in chocolate.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.934
<i>I've had to rebuild the structure</i>
<i>for the house twice, that took time.</i>

21:09.184 --> 21:11.478
-Guide me.
-Yeah, it's there.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.355
-Okay, we gotta turn it, though.
-Okay.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.732
-I need to not... oh, my gosh.
-Watch. It's okay, it's okay, I got it,

21:15.816 --> 21:17.067
I'm not letting it go.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.903
Okay. Because these... the elbow,
it's moving.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.072
I'm gonna have to recement that I think.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.119
Here. We can put a bracket or something

21:27.327 --> 21:28.412
-SABRINA: Here?
-Uh-huh.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.289
SABRINA: Yeah, 'cause this is the...
it's back heavy.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.707
<i>-I'm feeling nervous.</i>
-(GROANS)

21:31.873 --> 21:34.293
<i>There's just too much weight</i>
<i>on some of these joints</i>

21:34.543 --> 21:37.546
<i>and the center of where this weight</i>
<i>needs to be is a little bit weaker</i>

21:37.671 --> 21:40.382
<i>than I'd like it to be.</i>
<i>I don't wanna take any chances,</i>

21:40.716 --> 21:44.344
<i>so I'm going to add some elements</i>
<i>to really give myself some insurance</i>

21:44.511 --> 21:46.638
that house won't go anywhere,
when I get it up there.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.433
This is the last time
I'm lifting this before it's done.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.853
<i>If I can't shore this structure up,</i>
<i>I'm going to have to pivot</i>

21:52.978 --> 21:57.232
<i>and have my house land on the piece</i>
<i>rather than defy gravity.</i>

21:57.399 --> 21:59.109
Perfect. Thank you.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.485
BENNY: I mean, team Phoenix,

22:00.569 --> 22:02.529
I'm still seeing the same.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.281
AMIRAH:
They just really need to move on.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.408
I mean, Mexico is full of color

22:06.491 --> 22:08.952
and the only thing I'm seeing
is white structure.

22:09.077 --> 22:11.246
SABRINA: There are so many things
that we still have to finish.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.083
SABRINA: <i>We have to cover </i>El Castillo,
<i>we have to cover all the wood base too</i>

22:15.167 --> 22:17.586
<i>with our plants and our produce,</i>
<i>we have to do our paths.</i>

22:17.669 --> 22:20.047
MARY CARMEN: It's, like,
time consuming because it's, like...

22:20.213 --> 22:21.631
-Yeah.
-...a lot of details.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.009
But it's gonna be amazing, guys.

22:24.134 --> 22:27.596
NOLAN: I'm gonna fix these faces,
Jefferson's like half apart now.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.309
<i>As we're sculpting the faces,</i>
<i>the entire base structure</i>

22:32.392 --> 22:34.269
<i>is starting to crumble from within.</i>

22:34.394 --> 22:37.564
I mean, these three
are falling apart, let me just...

22:38.106 --> 22:39.858
(CHUCKLES) <i>We're not</i>
<i>on like a mental breakdown,</i>

22:39.941 --> 22:41.985
-but I... we're stressed
-(CHUCKLES)

22:42.652 --> 22:45.572
To save this one, think we're gonna have
to wrap it completely.

22:45.697 --> 22:50.202
<i>Although we're hitting crazy setbacks,</i>
<i>we are still glued together,</i>

22:50.327 --> 22:51.870
<i>we're still communicating.</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:54.623
Do you want to put
some skewers and dowels in it?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.042
SAMIRA: Wonder if we should put
like butter cream or something.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.126
So, here's what I'm thinking,

22:58.251 --> 23:01.296
we Saran wrap the whole face really tight
and then we sculpt

23:01.380 --> 23:03.173
-on top of this plastic wrap.
-Let's do it.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.467
KETURAH: It's like a sleeping bag. Oh!

23:13.558 --> 23:15.268
SAMIRA: Who is... Who is this? (CHUCKLES)

23:15.352 --> 23:17.187
KETURAH: It's tedious, I know. I'm sorry.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.855
-NOLAN: No, no, no.
-But literally, like...

23:18.980 --> 23:21.149
-NOLAN: It's a solution, though.
-...we have to make it work, right?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.234
Yep.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.862
NOLAN: Worse comes to worse,
we're gonna paint a smiley face on there.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.280
(CHUCKLES)

23:27.364 --> 23:31.368
KETURAH: I'm gonna start the balloons.
I'm actually cooking the gumballs.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.621
I feel like I'm cultivating
baby chick eggs.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.374
It's actually all pointing
towards the heating lamp,

23:37.958 --> 23:41.002
but it's to make perfect little balloons.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.838
SAMIRA: How's it looking?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.590
Yeah, I feel much better
with the heads on.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.926
I don't even care
how this thing turns out.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.845
I'm so proud of what we overcame.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.055
(CHUCKLES) We're getting there.

24:00.981 --> 24:04.151
Hey. What you doin'? Wow.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.236
(CHUCKLES)

24:06.403 --> 24:08.697
-Deboning.
-Are you eating? Are you eating in secret?

24:08.822 --> 24:10.490
-You have to share.
-No, I need rice.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.159
-(CHUCKLES) I know.
-I couldn't eat this without rice.

24:12.742 --> 24:13.952
We'll incorporate it

24:14.077 --> 24:16.663
-on the fossilized area.
-MAYEN: Yeah, okay.

24:17.539 --> 24:21.334
I've incorporated some
of the surprise elements

24:21.543 --> 24:24.296
and I'm trying to figure out
what's Benny's concern.

24:24.880 --> 24:30.010
The judges said that, it's important
for the piece to have cohesion.

24:30.093 --> 24:32.387
When you look at it, to them it's like,

24:32.512 --> 24:34.014
-it's becoming too...
-MYTON: Chop suey.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.475
-MAYEN: Yeah.
-MYTON: We're gonna clean this up. Yeah.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.394
It was a good time
to kind of check together

24:39.561 --> 24:42.689
<i>that everything still needs to blend in.</i>

24:43.231 --> 24:45.942
MYTON:<i> I'm just filling,</i>
<i>so that the transition will be smooth</i>

24:46.026 --> 24:49.946
from the volcano to the farmland.
To make it look clean.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.116
How much time do we have left?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.786
MAYEN: (SIGHING)
I have to finish the house.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.331
Do the balloon. Still a lot more to do.

24:59.956 --> 25:03.418
The first coat is a process,
it's supposed to be ugly.

25:03.752 --> 25:08.381
-Mayen, are you praying?
-MAYEN: Kind of, I'm talking to my cake.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.718
I talk to my cake,
like normal people do.

25:11.801 --> 25:12.844
-(CHUCKLES)
-(CHUCKLES)

25:13.094 --> 25:17.474
Oh, man. Don't do this. No, no, no.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.434
I've worked so hard to keep you pretty.

25:19.518 --> 25:23.021
You know what? Normal is overrated,
I am not, so it's okay.

25:23.230 --> 25:26.691
JOANNE: See how you can...
these ones need like the big skewers.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.862
<i>For the balloon,</i>
<i>it's going to be various mixes of citrus</i>

25:31.029 --> 25:32.697
which we hollowed out.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.367
MAYEN: When you don't want it to fall
that's when it's gonna fall, so...

25:35.450 --> 25:38.995
<i>In the plot thickens challenge,</i>
<i>we were given the calamansi fruit</i>

25:39.079 --> 25:41.873
<i>and it is the perfect size</i>
<i>to use as a filler.</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:43.416
JOANNE: We're gonna be good.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.254
(ROUSING MUSIC PLAYING)

25:48.421 --> 25:51.550
We have to put this house on the platform,
so I'm feeling nervous

25:51.633 --> 25:53.843
about the structure
and if it's gonna hold.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.929
-SABRINA: Grace, you got that side?
-GRACE: No.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.597
The house is looking heavy.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.308
GRACE: Breathe. Don't hurt yourself.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.601
-SABRINA: I'm shaking right now.
-I know.

26:01.685 --> 26:05.480
If the <i>Up</i> house doesn't stay there,
we're not gonna have a story.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.691
-I mean, then it's not an <i>Up</i> story.
-That's the most important...

26:07.774 --> 26:08.900
You need the house and the balloons...

26:08.984 --> 26:10.068
-Correct.
-...to tell the story.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.279
-GRACE: You got it?
-SABRINA: Not yet!

26:12.529 --> 26:13.863
-GRACE: Breathe.
-SABRINA: I'm breathing.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.199
GRACE :Nothing else matters right now,
just the sturdiness of this house.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.951
-GRACE: That's it.
-SABRINA: Is it on?

26:18.076 --> 26:19.369
-Yes.
-Come here, come here!

26:19.452 --> 26:21.454

I cannot believe we just did that.

MARY CARMEN:
I know, me neither!

26:22.831 --> 26:25.125
Okay, you guys, just one hour left.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.878
It's time to grab that garden hose
and pull your project on home.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.716
Are you serious?
I have, like, exposed parts over here.

26:34.301 --> 26:38.346
Uh, I'm working on the rice paddies,
right now. I'm using dried wheat.

26:38.471 --> 26:41.516
So, the noodles
from the plot thickens I used it as rice.

26:41.683 --> 26:46.646
-Um, like growing rice in the field.
-MAYEN: I need to finish the side here.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.819

<i>very proud of what we've achieved,</i>

26:57.616 --> 27:02.370
Yeah, pretty much done, and just
the final finishing touches on it.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.916
NOLAN: Yeah. I feel like I just raised
the cool status.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.337
I'm working on the clouds,
the last of the clouds.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.964
I'm trying to make this pie a moon.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.799

the apple pie up there?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.051

-KETURAH: Yeah.

We're trying to get every last bit
of landscaping done on our foodscape,

27:26.394 --> 27:29.230
so we can add flowers and color
for Amirah.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.109
-(SIGHS) Go.
-MARY CARMEN: Where're you gonna put it?

-Um, where it can be seen.

we have these little butterflies too,

if you wanna put 'em around the skulls,
the little orange ones.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.618
MARY CARMEN: I don't think
we have time for that.

Time is starting to run out...

that my teammates are nervous too.

28:00.970 --> 28:05.058
Benny was worried about how many elements
we're going to be integrating,

28:05.308 --> 28:07.602
but I think, he's going to be impressed.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.313
SABRINA: Hey, can we put an undecorated
sugar skull on there or should we not?

28:10.397 --> 28:15.485
Time is almost up! Just one minute
before Carl's house crosses the sky.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.320
Oh, my gosh. Sixty seconds,
let's get Rosita on here now.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.447
-Rosita's there!
-I'm gonna just reinforce

28:19.572 --> 28:21.783
this quick and it's good.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.284
MAYEN: What am I...
what else are we missing?

28:23.410 --> 28:25.161
I'm just trying to think, like...

28:26.371 --> 28:28.081
-Come on, guys!
-MARY CARMEN: Oh! It's broken.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.291
-Can have another one of this.
-SABRINA: Here. Here, here.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.669
(SAMIRA EXCLAIMS, CHUCKLES) Oh, no.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.337
-Five!
-(GRUNTS)

28:34.921 --> 28:36.423
-Four!
-We got it, guys. (EXCLAIMS)

28:36.756 --> 28:39.843
-Last touches.
-Three seconds, you guys! Two!

28:40.552 --> 28:44.973
-One! Time’s up and tools down!
-(CONTESTANTS CHEER)

28:45.098 --> 28:46.099

-(SABRINA AND MARY CARMEN CHEER)
-(SIGHS)

28:48.059 --> 28:49.310
MAYEN: High fives.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.855
-KETURAH: Here, give me a hug!
-(TEAM LAUGHING)

28:52.105 --> 28:54.190
You've all created
one of a kind foodscapes.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.276
And from what I see already,

28:56.693 --> 28:59.320
this is going to be a difficult choice
to make.

28:59.654 --> 29:02.073
Best Coasters, let's see what you got.

29:04.117 --> 29:05.535
Well, first things first.

29:05.618 --> 29:08.663
What are the feelings you have now
to finally be done?

29:08.872 --> 29:11.833
I couldn't be more proud
of how it turned out.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.126
-Oh, yeah.
-KEKE: All right, you guys.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.003
Walk me through the story
of your foodscape.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.677
NOLAN: <i>We are so excited</i>
<i>to show our wilderness explorer</i>

29:22.802 --> 29:27.348
<i>the magic of Mount Rushmore</i>
<i>on the night of a stormy Fourth of July.</i>

29:27.474 --> 29:28.683
Oh! A stormy!

29:28.767 --> 29:30.059
-NOLAN: Yeah!
-That's good!

29:30.185 --> 29:31.269
-BENNY: Oh!
-KEKE: Okay.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.689
NOLAN: <i>Yeah, there's loaves</i>
<i>of bread that are in the front.</i>

29:35.356 --> 29:39.152
<i>Walnuts on the front, there's sprigs</i>
<i>of rosemary and kale sprouts.</i>

29:39.611 --> 29:41.863
<i>We made the faces</i>
<i>out of modelling chocolate</i>

29:41.988 --> 29:45.700
<i>on rice cereal treats,</i>
<i>and then Shiitake mushrooms</i>

29:45.825 --> 29:47.702
<i>underneath the head, like rocks.</i>

29:47.911 --> 29:48.953
KEKE: What about Carl's house?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.538
-What is that all made of?
-Oh, man, okay.

29:50.663 --> 29:53.500
<i>I saw these cinnamon sticks and I knew</i>
<i>I had to use it for the trimming.</i>

29:53.583 --> 29:57.420
<i>I found these graham crackers.</i>
<i>I used some beef jerky, our...</i>

29:57.670 --> 29:58.880
-Plot thickens.
-...plot thickens.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.758
-Okay.
-KETURAH: <i>The balloons are a mixture</i>

30:01.841 --> 30:06.721
<i>of gumballs and edible lace,</i>
<i>and then another element</i>

30:06.805 --> 30:09.808
of the plot thickens that we used
is an apple pie.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.061
<i>-And we actually made it into a moon.</i>
-KEKE:<i> Okay, and then the clouds,</i>

30:13.144 --> 30:14.479
what did you use to create that?

30:14.562 --> 30:18.483
I actually used
a more dried out version of pastillage.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.193
-KEKE:<i> Hmm.</i>
<i>-And when you cook it,</i>

30:20.276 --> 30:22.320
<i>you have these beautiful cloud effects.</i>

30:24.364 --> 30:28.159
The fact that the house is floating
next to a head that's the size of a head,

30:28.243 --> 30:32.413
I think is really cool part of the story
because it's really showing the magnitude

30:32.497 --> 30:34.040
<i>of Mount Rushmore.</i>

30:34.332 --> 30:37.126
I definitely know
who Lincoln is and Teddy,

30:37.210 --> 30:40.713
<i>but I was wondering,</i>
<i>why Jefferson was sort of open-mouthed</i>

30:40.797 --> 30:44.342
and he's like, looking over,
and I'm now realizing he's like,

30:44.425 --> 30:46.719
"Oh, my gosh, a floating<i> Up </i>house

30:46.803 --> 30:49.305
-"with balloons is about to land on us."
-KETURAH: He's surprised.

30:49.389 --> 30:52.892
And I think that it's really cool
that you took something that is a landmark

30:53.059 --> 30:55.562
and sort of,
gave it your little Pixar spin.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.855
-Benny?
-Yes.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.108
I wanna talk about the technical ability
that you're seeing displayed.

31:00.191 --> 31:04.028
I love the fact that it's giving us
the illusion that this house is floating,

31:04.195 --> 31:07.866
<i>there's a lot of cool carvings</i>
<i>and sculpting techniques on the faces,</i>

31:07.949 --> 31:12.495
and then all the faces look cohesive,
so you guys did an excellent job for that.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.207
I have to say
the use of the gumballs were on point,

31:16.583 --> 31:20.336
it is giving me that shiny look
that the balloons normally have.

31:20.461 --> 31:24.215
I would have expect to see more balloons
in a larger scale,

31:24.299 --> 31:27.802
but I know you struggle with the heads,
it falls apart.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.514
It's just incredible, the way you guys
were able to recover from that.

31:31.681 --> 31:33.266
-It's just amazing.
-NOLAN: Thank you.

31:34.142 --> 31:38.187
When we think about<i> Up, </i>I mean,
it's one of Pixar's most colorful films.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.190
so I really wanna dive into,
how you feel they exemplify

31:41.274 --> 31:42.734
that in the foodscape, Amirah.

31:42.901 --> 31:47.697
<i>You guys chose to cover it</i>
<i>completely in one color and in this case</i>

31:48.072 --> 31:51.075
<i>that worked so beautifully,</i>
<i>because you are giving</i>

31:51.326 --> 31:54.287
<i>all of the attention</i>
<i>to the </i>Up<i> house and the balloons,</i>

31:54.454 --> 31:55.538
<i>this is something that...</i>

31:55.747 --> 31:58.583
I can look at this
and I know exactly what I'm looking at.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.086
<i>I agree with Benny,</i>
<i>I would love to see more balloons</i>

32:02.170 --> 32:05.798
or just a larger in size
because that is what's defying gravity,

32:05.882 --> 32:08.301
but when I look at this build
the first thing I think of is

32:08.384 --> 32:10.303
-"Wow, the house is actually floating."
-KEKE: Mm-hm.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.472
And I think that,
that is what we were talking about

32:12.555 --> 32:14.057
when we meant defying gravity.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.559
-Well, wishing you the best of luck.
-TEAM: Thank you.

32:16.643 --> 32:17.894
-KEKE: Yes.
-BENNY: See you later.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.396
-Majarlika.
-MAYEN: Majarlika.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.857
-Majarlika, yes!
-MAYEN: Yes, correct.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.901
<i>-Kumusta!</i>
-KEKE: Oh, my gosh, well...

32:25.068 --> 32:27.236
(HESITATES) ...I gotta ask you guys,
what are your thoughts

32:27.320 --> 32:28.696
that are going through your heads,
right now?

32:28.988 --> 32:32.742
This piece really hits home,
so when we were done it's...

32:33.117 --> 32:35.662
it really just hits
right in the heart, too.

32:35.745 --> 32:40.124
There are so many different cool elements
which makes me wanna know the entire story

32:40.249 --> 32:42.210
of your foodscape,
so please walk me through it.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.382
MAYEN:<i> We wanted to show our explorer</i>

32:47.465 --> 32:50.426
<i>what the Philippines</i>
<i>would look like typically.</i>

32:50.510 --> 32:56.140
<i>So, the perfect cone of the Mayon Volcano.</i>
<i>Surrounded by the Philippine culture,</i>

32:56.224 --> 32:58.393
<i>which is showcased through the Nipa hut,</i>

32:58.810 --> 33:01.938
<i>and our religious culture</i>
<i>which is showcased through our church.</i>

33:02.021 --> 33:06.401
<i>It's like a snapshot into what is</i>
<i>near and dear to every Filipino's heart.</i>

33:06.609 --> 33:11.072
<i>And as it so happens, Joanne's mom</i>
<i>used to teach in a place near there,</i>

33:11.155 --> 33:13.199
so we really did take
that as a major sign.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.826
What are all the different foods

33:14.909 --> 33:17.829
-you actually used in the volcano?
-So, for the volcano itself,

33:17.912 --> 33:21.374
<i>we used a lot</i>
<i>of different types and colors of bread,</i>

33:21.457 --> 33:23.584
<i>but interspersed into it</i>

33:23.710 --> 33:28.297
<i>is a whole lot of other ingredients</i>
<i>like vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, nuts,</i>

33:28.423 --> 33:31.551
<i>um, all sorts of dried flowers,</i>
<i>fruits so...</i>

33:31.676 --> 33:34.470
<i>I'm missing something 'cause</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure the whole market is there.</i>

33:34.637 --> 33:35.555
-KEKE: Oh, yes!
-(ALL LAUGH)

33:35.930 --> 33:38.307
<i>The </i>Up<i> house</i>
<i>is our homage to cake artists.</i>

33:38.391 --> 33:39.642
<i>So, the bottom is made out of cake.</i>

33:39.726 --> 33:41.811
<i>The top is made</i>
<i>out of different types citruses,</i>

33:41.894 --> 33:46.315
which we also incorporated
our native calamansi into the...

33:46.524 --> 33:48.317
-From your plot thickening basket.
-TEAM: Yes.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.653
I love it and I'm ready to hear from you,
Amirah.

33:50.737 --> 33:53.239
What do you think about the story,
and the creativity displayed?

33:53.656 --> 33:56.951
I mean, first of all, the fact
that you're paying homage to the culture

33:57.035 --> 34:00.747
<i>that is in you and what the church meant,</i>
<i>and, you know, what the rice fields</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:02.957
<i>and the hut, I think is so beautiful.</i>

34:03.332 --> 34:06.669
BENNY: The balloons of all the houses
that we have here, proportionally,

34:06.794 --> 34:09.672
<i>I believe this the closest one</i>
<i>to the actual, real one.</i>

34:09.839 --> 34:12.967
<i>And the fact that you guys used</i>
<i>different type of fruits</i>

34:13.259 --> 34:15.261
<i>to create the balloons is amazing.</i>

34:15.470 --> 34:17.013
It works perfectly,
especially in combination

34:17.096 --> 34:18.765
-with the house.
-Thank you.

34:18.848 --> 34:23.061
What I'm having difficult time
is just the actual volcano.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.772
Why?
While I know this is a food competition,

34:25.980 --> 34:28.858
and we get excited and we want to just
wanna throw all type of food elements

34:28.983 --> 34:33.112
<i>that we wanted to use.</i>
<i>We have to be careful with it because,</i>

34:33.279 --> 34:36.991
to my eye, we lost a little bit
of the shape because of the lumps

34:37.075 --> 34:40.328
<i>from all the breads or the vegetables</i>
<i>that you guys were using.</i>

34:40.661 --> 34:41.913
The way that I would probably have done it

34:41.996 --> 34:48.086
is using different type of cookie crumbs
to bring out the shape, the cracks,

34:48.252 --> 34:52.965
<i>the texture, so we can still see</i>
<i>the volcano in a more clean way,</i>

34:53.049 --> 34:56.094
while still using other edible mediums.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.679
Yeah. I'm interested to hear
what you have to say, Amirah,

34:58.763 --> 35:01.516
-when it comes to color.
-AMIRAH: <i>The fruit is so creative,</i>

35:01.599 --> 35:04.560
<i>the choice that you did</i>
<i>of using its natural colors,</i>

35:04.644 --> 35:07.605
<i>and then only painting</i>
<i>the ones that needed to add</i>

35:07.688 --> 35:10.024
<i>the blues and the purples, I think that,</i>
<i>that was such a smart choice</i>

35:10.108 --> 35:12.610
<i>because had you gone in</i>
<i>and colored all of them,</i>

35:13.152 --> 35:14.779
it would have lost its effect, right?

35:14.946 --> 35:17.281
-You guys did an amazing job...
-MAYEN: We appreciate it so much.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.033
...and I definitely see
your heart in this foodscape.

-I appreciate that.
-Wish you the best of luck.

-Yes!
-We've risen.

All right. So, please walk us
through the story of your foodscape.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.436
SABRINA:<i> The story of our foodscape</i>
<i>is that our wilderness explorer</i>

35:47.520 --> 35:51.274
<i>is beginning to land</i>
<i>in this magical world of Mexico.</i>

35:51.566 --> 35:56.028
And they're gonna learn
a lot of history and a lot of culture,

-and eat a lot of delicious food.
-Food.

35:59.615 --> 36:02.451
SABRINA:<i> So, we have rice,</i>
<i>we have cinnamon bark,</i>

36:02.535 --> 36:03.911
<i>we have cocoa nibs,</i>

36:04.162 --> 36:07.415
<i>we have out trail of marigolds,</i>
<i>which are also an edible flower.</i>

36:07.540 --> 36:10.126
<i>We used the masa in our pathway.</i>

36:10.418 --> 36:15.089
<i>We have pineapples, we have orchids,</i>
<i>and we have these beautiful tea leaves</i>

36:15.381 --> 36:18.259
<i>that we put in to really give</i>
<i>that jungle feel.</i>

36:18.426 --> 36:20.303
<i>We have a traditional Mexican sugar skull,</i>

36:20.428 --> 36:23.222
made the traditional Mexican way.
Not casting it out of chocolate,

36:23.514 --> 36:26.767
but really taking the time
to let it set up correctly.

36:29.604 --> 36:33.065
<i>So, when you start with our house,</i>
<i>we have it wrapped with tortillas.</i>

36:33.274 --> 36:36.194
<i>We actually have different</i>
<i>flavored tortillas in there as well.</i>

36:36.444 --> 36:39.822
<i>As you move down,</i>
<i>our trees have collard greens</i>

36:40.156 --> 36:43.951
<i>and different types of lettuce.</i>
<i>And then we did our tree</i>

36:44.202 --> 36:47.079
<i>with rice cereal treats,</i>
<i>but then we wrapped it in chocolate.</i>

36:47.205 --> 36:50.791
<i>We have our amazingly sculpted jaguar</i>

<i>And then our </i>Castillo<i> is made</i>
<i>from textured Texas toast.</i>

37:04.096 --> 37:05.765
The balloons are made out of popcorn.

<i>Popcorn was originally eaten in Mexico.</i>

Okay, Amirah, well, let's dive
into a story that is very close to home.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.542
AMIRAH: <i>The details</i>
<i>that I'm obsessed with,</i>

37:33.751 --> 37:37.755
<i>through your story, is that you wanted</i>
<i>to give us a tour of Mexico.</i>

37:37.838 --> 37:41.092
And you really did that. I mean,
I see it, I see Jalisco, I see Puebla,

37:41.217 --> 37:43.886
I see the different states
that represent ingredients,

37:43.970 --> 37:47.682
and everything that you used.
The one thing I would've done differently,

37:47.807 --> 37:51.310
so that the story really came together
is some of the most beautiful things

37:51.394 --> 37:54.397
<i>that you've created are so hidden</i>
<i>in the back</i>

37:54.480 --> 37:57.400

to push these to the back

<i>and bring up Rosita,</i>
<i>and the jaguar and </i>la ofrenda,

38:00.903 --> 38:04.198
because I wanna see them
as a part of the whole story.

38:04.323 --> 38:06.284
-That makes a lot of sense.
-Really does, it does.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.494
Benny there are a lot
of different elements going on.

38:08.577 --> 38:11.330
I wanna talk about the technical things
that are jumping out at you.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.666
BENNY: <i>There's a few things</i>
<i>that I really love about this piece.</i>

38:13.833 --> 38:17.545
The jaguar. You did an excellent job
working with the chocolate.

38:17.753 --> 38:19.922
And I believe you used pure chocolate
and this everything...

38:20.047 --> 38:22.049
-Yep. Mm-hmm.
-...a 100 percent chocolate.

38:22.300 --> 38:26.804
BENNY: <i>Also, I love the fact that you guys</i>
<i>add texture into the pyramid,</i>

38:27.013 --> 38:30.266
<i>the sculpting details on Rosita,</i>
<i>just beautiful, too.</i>

38:30.516 --> 38:32.101
She looks like she's having
so much fun over there.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.894
And she's sending you kisses.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.898
Yes. And I know you guys
were having a lot of issues structurally.

38:38.024 --> 38:42.111
<i>While you guys were able to balance</i>
<i>the house on top of the tree,</i>

38:42.194 --> 38:45.072
which that was the mission
that you guys were looking for.

38:45.197 --> 38:49.660
<i>I still have issues</i>
<i>with seeing the actual shape of the tree.</i>

38:49.869 --> 38:51.370
<i>It's not visually...</i>

38:51.495 --> 38:53.873
-It's not realistic.
-Correct, it's too set.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.417
Time was definitely our enemy on that.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.296
BENNY: But fantastic job,
making the trick to hold the actual house.

39:00.588 --> 39:05.176
Absolutely lovely, lovely job, you guys.
I'm wishing you the best of luck.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.385
Thank you.

39:07.136 --> 39:11.098
Okay, so let's talk about it.
The one thing that I think we all agree

39:11.182 --> 39:13.976
with is these people put their hearts
into these foodscapes.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.394
-BENNY: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
-KEKE: <i>I mean they always do,</i>

39:15.519 --> 39:17.897
but this particular challenge
really made them dig deep

39:17.980 --> 39:19.523
on what's important to them.

39:20.316 --> 39:23.402
They all have beautiful, deep stories,
I mean, it's crazy.
