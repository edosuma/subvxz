[♪♪♪]

00:12.880 --> 00:16.749
[♪♪♪]

00:42.910 --> 00:45.544
Two salmon steaks,
two New York strips, medium--

00:45.579 --> 00:47.546
Rice pilaf instead of
mashed potatoes on both.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.081
You have to lower
the heat on the Béarnaise

00:49.116 --> 00:50.282
before it starts to clot.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.685
Okay...

00:59.927 --> 01:02.428
[telephone ringing]

01:04.198 --> 01:06.465
Hey, sis.
Long time no see.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.466
I know, I keep meaning

01:07.501 --> 01:08.467
to come up for a visit,

01:08.502 --> 01:09.435
but I never seem able

01:09.470 --> 01:10.436
to find the time.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.737
How is everybody?

01:11.772 --> 01:12.671
Great, actually.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.273
Matthew volunteered to be
assistant coach

01:14.308 --> 01:16.108
for Sophia's softball team
this year.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.810
She's their star pitcher.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.178
Of course, she is.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.145
<i> It's a toss-up between</i>
<i> which of the two</i>

01:20.181 --> 01:21.080
<i> is having more fun.</i>

01:21.115 --> 01:23.248
I bet.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.283
<i> So, how about you?</i>

01:24.318 --> 01:25.250
<i> How's life in the big city?</i>

01:25.286 --> 01:27.319
You know, the usual--

01:27.354 --> 01:28.353
non-stop busy.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.956
You work too much, Gabby.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.524
You need to find some balance
in your life.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.525
<i> Well, balance seems to be</i>

01:33.561 --> 01:35.627
in short supply these days.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.129
I guess.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.630
I don't know how you do it.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.199
<i> Sometimes, neither do I.</i>

01:40.234 --> 01:41.366
Must be nice living

01:41.402 --> 01:43.368
the tranquil New England life.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.937
<i> Oh, I don't know</i>
<i> about tranquil,</i>

01:44.972 --> 01:46.004
<i> but we all seem to love it.</i>

01:46.040 --> 01:47.506
So, how about you?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.540
Aside from work.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.775
<i> How are you doing?</i>

01:49.810 --> 01:50.976
<i> Are you still seeing David?</i>

01:51.011 --> 01:52.444
Yeah...

01:52.480 --> 01:53.545
when we can...

01:53.581 --> 01:55.013
Though with our schedules,

01:55.049 --> 01:56.949
it seems fewer
and far between lately.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.217
[text alert chimes]

01:58.252 --> 01:59.952
Give me one second.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.057
And with that,

02:05.092 --> 02:06.792
I just got a dinner invite
from David,

02:06.827 --> 02:08.961
and it says
"I can't wait to talk."

02:10.431 --> 02:11.797
Ooh. That sounds promising.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.366
I'll say.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.501
<i> Well, keep me posted.</i>

02:15.536 --> 02:16.935
Bye-bye.

02:24.378 --> 02:29.748
[♪♪♪]

02:29.783 --> 02:31.517
Right, here you go.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.951
You tell me that's not
the best burger in town.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.655
Another home run, am I right?

02:36.690 --> 02:39.725
It's a hamburger and fries,
Caleb, not a filet mignon.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.360
Come on, Danny, tell the truth.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.594
It's good, right?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.530
-Good enough.
-[door entry bells jingle]

02:47.902 --> 02:49.034
Afternoon, Christina...

02:50.137 --> 02:51.870
How goes the real estate world
out in Bright Shore?

02:51.906 --> 02:53.005
Why?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.540
Are you looking
to sell the place?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.008
Not by a long shot,

02:56.043 --> 02:57.042
but I saw the place
down the street

02:57.077 --> 02:58.277
finally shut its doors.

02:58.312 --> 02:59.144
[Christina]
Oh, Petite Patisserie?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.679
I just took the listing.
It's a shame.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.714
It barely lasted a year.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.349
Odd choice,
opening a French bakery

03:04.385 --> 03:05.551
in the land
of steak and potatoes.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.219
Or hamburgers and fries.

03:07.254 --> 03:09.221
I think the problem
was poor management.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.857
More like poor judgement,
opening it in the first place.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.959
[Trevor] Don't mind
my brother, Christina--

03:13.994 --> 03:16.261
he just likes to fancy Delaney's
as the best place in town.

03:17.965 --> 03:18.964
Here you go.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.933
Extra-crispy onion rings,

03:20.968 --> 03:22.568
with ranch dressing on the side.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.702
$6.75.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.937
Now, that's a deal.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.573
[door entry bells jingle]

03:27.608 --> 03:28.907
[Caleb] Hey, sweetie.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.377
Dad, can I skip
softball practice today?

03:33.514 --> 03:36.315
No, you can't skip practice.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.015
How many times
do I got to tell you?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.550
We stand a really good chance

03:38.586 --> 03:39.952
of winning the pennant
this season.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.986
Oh, right.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.254
And then I can get a trophy.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.057
[chuckles]

03:46.293 --> 03:47.492
Oh, hi, Mrs. Weaver.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.161
Is Sophia
already down at the field?

03:49.196 --> 03:50.195
Yeah. Her dad took her down

03:50.231 --> 03:52.097
to throw the ball around
before practice starts.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.366
What for? Extra credit?

03:55.502 --> 03:56.435
No, silly,

03:56.470 --> 03:58.403
to help take our team
to the championship.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.438
Now, come on,
let's get a move on.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.739
We've got work to do.

04:06.146 --> 04:07.379
Play now, listen later.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.150
See, you guys.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.318
-Thanks for this.
-Enjoy.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.087
Bye.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.922
Can I get you another coffee?

04:16.957 --> 04:18.257
Yes. Fill it up.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.366
David, I can't believe

04:27.401 --> 04:29.167
you got us a table
at this place.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.435
I heard the wait
for a reservation

04:30.471 --> 04:31.370
was, like, six months.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.506
I guess it's all about
who you know, right?

04:35.643 --> 04:36.575
Champagne?

04:37.678 --> 04:39.544
Okay...

04:39.580 --> 04:41.280
I'm getting nervously excited.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.121
So, to the future.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.658
I'm not going to lie, David.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.494
My head's been spinning
since you sent me that text.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.997
I didn't mean to cloak
this evening in mystery,

04:59.033 --> 05:01.033
but with news like this,

05:01.068 --> 05:02.834
I didn't want to just...

05:02.870 --> 05:03.802
blurt it out.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.204
Gabby...

05:06.240 --> 05:07.706
Yes, David?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.808
-I can't believe
I'm about to say this...

05:09.843 --> 05:11.643
You're looking...

05:11.679 --> 05:14.246
at the new executive chef
of this place!

05:14.281 --> 05:15.514
What?

05:15.549 --> 05:17.215
I start Monday.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.651
I don't understand.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.653
I guess the owner

05:21.689 --> 05:23.388
wasn't too thrilled
with his last chef,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.324
so the other night,

05:25.359 --> 05:27.592
I hosted
a private tasting for him...

05:27.628 --> 05:28.527
and then I got the job.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.228
That's...

05:30.264 --> 05:31.396
That's great.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.331
David, I'm happy for you.

05:33.867 --> 05:34.566
What's wrong?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.736
I guess your text
had me expecting

05:37.771 --> 05:40.405
something a bit more...

05:40.441 --> 05:41.873
well, more personal.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.908
About us.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.978
But it's not like
either of us are in any rush.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.215
David, it's been
almost two years.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.817
I know.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.787
It's just, right now...

05:55.823 --> 05:57.923
the timing isn't right.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.091
The timing is never right.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.227
I'm sorry, David.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.497
I just can't do this anymore.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.070
Order of fettuccine.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.572
And a Dover sole?

06:13.607 --> 06:14.673
Right!

06:24.418 --> 06:25.350
There you go.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.519
I need a Spaghetti Vongole,

06:27.554 --> 06:29.020
garlic bread
and a bowl of gazpacho.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.392
Gabby, who plated this?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.460
I did, Chef.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.962
And does this look
presentable to you?

06:39.133 --> 06:40.532
No, Chef.
The fish is dry.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.573
-This is not my Alfredo sauce.
-No, Chef.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.976
We ran out of cream
so I substituted half and half.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.310
So let me understand this.

06:52.346 --> 06:53.111
Rather than tell the servers

06:53.147 --> 06:54.513
that we've run out
of fettuccine,

06:54.548 --> 06:55.781
you decided to alter my recipe?

06:57.951 --> 06:58.784
Yes, Chef.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.120
Go help Andrew on desserts.
I'm taking over.

07:08.729 --> 07:09.961
All right, listen up.

07:09.997 --> 07:10.829
How are we looking

07:10.864 --> 07:12.264
on the steak tartar
and the calamari?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.142
[Chef] Gabby, we need to talk.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.379
I am so sorry
about earlier, Chef.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.380
I had an off night.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.781
It's not just that.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.550
Lately, I have noticed

07:31.585 --> 07:32.584
that you've been
sending out plates

07:32.619 --> 07:34.586
that you would have
never let slide by before.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.889
And tonight,
altering my recipe like that?

07:37.925 --> 07:38.824
[Gabby] I know, Chef.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.760
That is grounds for dismissal.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.231
Gabby, you've worked with me
for six years now.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.699
I mean,
I consider you like family,

07:47.734 --> 07:49.367
but I can't have you
running my kitchen

07:49.403 --> 07:50.302
if your heart's not in it.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.239
My mentor would say
you've lost your joie de vivre,

07:54.274 --> 07:56.875
and as hard as it is
for me to say this,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.743
I think it's just because
you've worked here for too long.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.345
One day,
everything becomes routine,

08:00.380 --> 08:01.913
and...

08:01.949 --> 08:03.381
things just go downhill
from there.

08:03.417 --> 08:06.051
But what I need is
that passion that I saw in you

08:06.086 --> 08:07.352
when you first
stepped into my kitchen.

08:09.756 --> 08:10.922
Gabby, I just--

08:10.958 --> 08:11.857
I don't know what to do here.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.759
Yes, you do, Chef.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.394
You just don't want to say it.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.197
I think it's time
for me to finally leave.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.069
You need to go
and rediscover your passion.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.544
And where exactly do I go
to find that?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.353
[Christina]
I can't believe you're here.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.523
I told you I'd come up
and visit you one of these days.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.359
It really is so good
to see you.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.327
Oh, you too, Gabby.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.764
I'm thrilled you took me up
on my offer,

08:52.799 --> 08:53.632
but why now?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.634
You were awfully cryptic
on the phone.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.135
I just needed to get away.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.737
Mm-hmm.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.038
Don't bother covering.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.206
I can already tell.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.074
There's something going on
that you're not telling me,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.976
isn't there?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.878
[Gabby] Ever since
my mom married your dad,

09:06.914 --> 09:09.314
you always could read me
like a book.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.783
So... spill.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.919
Okay, well, first of all,

09:13.954 --> 09:16.288
I broke up with David...

09:16.323 --> 09:18.390
this time, for good.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.925
Aw. I'm sorry.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.394
Don't be,
it was a long time coming.

09:23.597 --> 09:27.065
And...

09:27.100 --> 09:29.000
I quit my job.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.101
You what?

09:30.137 --> 09:31.903
-Seriously, Gabby?
-Yeah.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.138
But you've been working
for Franco

09:33.173 --> 09:34.339
for practically ever.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.007
I know.
That's the problem.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.275
You know,
I couldn't help but feel

09:37.311 --> 09:39.077
that I was spinning my wheels,

09:39.112 --> 09:41.580
working at the same place
for all these years, you know?

09:41.615 --> 09:42.480
So you figured

09:42.516 --> 09:43.748
a change of scenery
would do you good?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.083
Yeah,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.017
and I don't know,

09:46.053 --> 09:47.152
get a fresh perspective
on some things.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.954
A fresh perspective?
On what?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.289
I don't know...

09:51.325 --> 09:53.024
Maybe...

09:53.060 --> 09:54.593
what am I going to do
with my life.

09:57.798 --> 09:58.763
I know that look.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.266
Well, what if I told you

10:01.301 --> 10:02.467
that sometimes
things happen for a reason?

10:02.502 --> 10:03.335
I would say

10:03.370 --> 10:05.303
you're about to tell me
the reason.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.272
[Christina] Better yet--

10:07.307 --> 10:08.440
I'll show you.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.109
Okay...

10:19.386 --> 10:21.553
Petite Patisserie.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.189
What, are they looking
for a new sous-chef?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.490
More like a new owner.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.658
Place closed down a month ago.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.159
The space just became available.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.160
And...

10:29.196 --> 10:30.495
I happen to be the realtor
for this property.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.563
-What?
-Come on.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.331
Wasn't it always your dream

10:33.367 --> 10:36.034
to open up
your own restaurant one day?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.003
I mean, yeah.
Of course, Christina.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.137
But usually,

10:39.172 --> 10:40.639
you make it to executive chef

10:40.674 --> 10:42.407
before you venture out
on your own.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.376
Well, maybe it's time
you skip a step.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.810
Just wait till
you get a look inside.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.049
I'm crazy.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.350
No. I can't open a restaurant.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.418
[Christina] Why not?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.552
Aren't you the one who said

10:54.588 --> 10:55.553
you could achieve
anything in life

10:55.589 --> 10:56.488
if you want it badly enough?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.489
I did?

10:57.524 --> 10:58.456
Mm-hmm.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.026
I did.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.428
What happened to that girl?

11:03.463 --> 11:04.362
She broke up
with her boyfriend,

11:04.398 --> 11:05.563
quit her job,

11:05.599 --> 11:07.399
and is now looking to a start
a new chapter in her life.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.171
You're right.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.239
You're right!

11:14.274 --> 11:16.441
I can't wait to look inside.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.043
And I can't wait to show you.

11:26.753 --> 11:27.752
Amazing, right?

11:27.788 --> 11:30.288
It's not too big
or overwhelming.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.023
Not at all.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.792
With some paint
and a few personal touches,

11:33.827 --> 11:36.695
this place could be perfect.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.396
All it needs
is your unique flare

11:38.432 --> 11:39.731
and your brilliant cooking.

11:39.766 --> 11:40.899
What happened
with the last tenants?

11:40.934 --> 11:44.035
They were a young couple,
first-time restaurant owners.

11:44.071 --> 11:44.869
I think they were in
over their heads

11:44.905 --> 11:46.805
even before
they opened the doors.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.873
People love to romanticize
owning a restaurant,

11:48.909 --> 11:50.108
but they never realize
the work that goes into it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.076
[Christina] They don't--

11:51.111 --> 11:53.044
but you do.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.279
The owner
is eager to lease the space,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.081
and I bet I could get you
a terrific deal.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.582
That's nice.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.117
And what about what's here?
The chairs, the tables?

11:59.152 --> 12:00.752
[Christina]
That's the best part.

12:00.787 --> 12:02.087
It's all included in the rent.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.922
Seriously?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.090
Wow.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.257
[Christina] It would really
lower your start-up costs.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.392
I'm telling you, Gabby,

12:07.427 --> 12:10.095
I really think this is
an opportunity of a lifetime.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.396
Maybe, Christina,

12:11.431 --> 12:12.363
but I don't know

12:12.399 --> 12:14.899
if I'm biting off
more than I can chew here.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.668
You'll never know
unless you take a bite.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.837
There's a lot for me
to think about.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.704
[Christina] Tell you what--

12:19.740 --> 12:20.705
Why don't I give you
some alone time

12:20.741 --> 12:22.907
to explore the kitchen
and mull it all over?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.075
That's a great idea.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.009
I've got to get back
to the office.

12:25.045 --> 12:25.877
Lock up when you leave?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.580
And I will see you
back at the house.

12:28.615 --> 12:29.948
Sounds good.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.334
Customer.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.709
Hey. Welcome to Delaney's.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.011
I'm Caleb Delaney.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.712
The owner?

13:34.748 --> 13:36.748
[Caleb] The very same.

13:36.783 --> 13:39.050
So which is it,
late lunch or early dinner?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.019
Neither, actually.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.187
I was just a bit thirsty

13:42.222 --> 13:43.788
and I figured I'd pop in
for an iced tea.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.792
Well, lucky for you,
it's on the menu.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.364
I thought you said
you weren't hungry?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.732
Oh, I'm not.

13:54.768 --> 13:55.600
I just want to see

13:55.635 --> 13:56.868
what the good people
of Bright Shore

13:56.903 --> 13:59.470
like to eat at Delaney's.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.507
I see.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.441
So where are you from?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.443
New York.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.411
I'm here visiting my sister.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.547
That's funny,

14:09.583 --> 14:11.716
because I saw you standing
outside the old Patisserie.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.384
I figured you were looking
to lease the place

14:13.420 --> 14:15.553
and you came in
to check out the competition.

14:17.591 --> 14:18.556
No.

14:19.793 --> 14:20.925
That's ridiculous.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.194
Good, because I've had to watch

14:23.230 --> 14:25.096
three restaurants go under
in the past five years.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.866
And you're telling me
this why?

14:27.901 --> 14:30.869
Just a little friendly warning
for aspiring restaurateurs.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.072
"Aspiring" restaurateur?

14:35.108 --> 14:36.407
Well, I did just see you

14:36.443 --> 14:37.508
checking out the restaurant
down the street.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.911
So...

14:39.946 --> 14:41.980
What are you afraid of,

14:42.015 --> 14:43.214
a little healthy competition?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.617
No. I'd welcome it.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.852
I just hate to see people fail.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.925
Just so you know,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.261
I never...

14:56.296 --> 14:57.562
ever...

14:57.597 --> 14:59.230
fail at anything
I put my mind to.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.000
Wow. That's...

15:02.035 --> 15:02.934
That's good to hear.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.338
So then you are considering
taking over the place?

15:07.374 --> 15:09.741
First of all,
I haven't decided,

15:09.776 --> 15:11.442
and when I do,

15:11.478 --> 15:12.977
you'll be the last person
to find out.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.147
I don't know,
it's a pretty small town.

15:16.182 --> 15:17.815
News travels fast.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.317
Plus, the local
real estate agent

15:19.352 --> 15:20.818
is one of
my close, close friends.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.987
You mean Christina Weaver?

15:23.023 --> 15:25.089
Yup.

15:25.125 --> 15:25.990
She's my sister.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.594
Oh.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.698
So you must be--

15:33.733 --> 15:34.966
I'm Gabby.

15:35.969 --> 15:36.935
Gabby...

15:41.741 --> 15:42.941
Mm-mm...

15:44.511 --> 15:46.110
By the way...
What's your name again?

15:46.146 --> 15:48.846
-Caleb.
-Caleb.

15:48.882 --> 15:50.915
The iced tea
is a touch watery.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.608
He's just irritating...

16:17.644 --> 16:19.310
I don't know if he was trying
to discourage me

16:19.346 --> 16:20.545
from taking over the place

16:20.580 --> 16:22.146
or challenging me
to actually do it.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.948
That's just Caleb.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.050
He does have
a competitive streak.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.953
You know, he's something
of a hometown hero.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.056
He lead the varsity baseball
team to victory.

16:32.092 --> 16:34.959
That explains
all the sports decoration.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.494
He's clinging on
to his glory days.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.962
[Christina] He's harmless.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.664
Caleb might be a little rough
around the edges,

16:39.699 --> 16:41.299
but deep down,
he's got a good heart.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.800
Mm-hmm.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.669
Well, it can't be easy
being a single dad,

16:44.704 --> 16:45.803
running the restaurant,

16:45.839 --> 16:46.971
plus finding time

16:47.007 --> 16:48.239
to coach
his daughter's softball team.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.174
He's the coach, too?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.242
That's nice.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.411
Sophia and his daughter, Emily,
are best friends.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.379
[Gabby] Of course they are.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.814
What's next?

16:56.850 --> 16:58.349
Are you going to tell me
he's coming over for dinner?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.684
That's a great idea!

17:00.687 --> 17:01.519
Forget Caleb.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.688
Just concentrate
on the business at hand.

17:05.592 --> 17:06.724
Yeah. Figuring out exactly

17:06.760 --> 17:08.693
what it's going to take
to make this place a success.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.194
-[door opens]
-Hey!

17:11.931 --> 17:13.765
-Aunt Gabby!
-Sophie!

17:13.800 --> 17:16.100
It's so good to see you.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.536
I've missed you so much,
not-so-little one.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.739
How are you, Matthew?

17:21.775 --> 17:22.707
So good to see you.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.674
Thank you for the invitation.

17:23.710 --> 17:24.776
Are you kidding?

17:24.811 --> 17:25.777
I would trade
an empty guest room

17:25.812 --> 17:26.744
for a personal chef any day.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.846
What smells so good?

17:28.882 --> 17:31.449
Gabby's making pork loin
on a bed of polenta,

17:31.484 --> 17:32.784
with cranberry relish.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.119
My mouth is watering already.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.287
See?

17:36.322 --> 17:37.455
This is exactly
the kind of cuisine

17:37.490 --> 17:38.923
that will knock the socks off
the town of Bright Shore.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.058
You think?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.025
Yeah.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.894
It will be a welcome change
from the usual--

17:42.929 --> 17:44.796
diners, Chinese, pizza,
and of course--

17:44.831 --> 17:46.564
Delaney's Coastal Grille.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.565
Look at you,

17:47.600 --> 17:50.268
already getting familiar
with our local spots.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.536
Caleb made
quite the impression.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.703
Can I help cook?

17:52.739 --> 17:53.738
Yeah.

17:53.773 --> 17:54.705
Get a mixing bowl.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.873
I'm going to teach you
how to make polenta.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.242
I could get used to this.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.710
Oh, I already have.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.956
[Caleb] All right, girls,
ground-ball drill.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.224
Ground-ball drill.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.896
[Matthew] The team's really
giving it their all this season.

18:18.932 --> 18:19.997
If we stay on track,

18:20.033 --> 18:21.833
I wouldn't be surprised
if we make it to playoffs.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.234
I won't stop until we take home
the pennant.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.138
Hey, I heard you had
a little run-in yesterday

18:27.173 --> 18:27.972
with my sister-in-law?

18:28.007 --> 18:30.141
I don't know
if I can call it that,

18:30.176 --> 18:31.642
but I definitely seemed
to get a rise out of her.

18:31.678 --> 18:32.677
I'll say--

18:32.712 --> 18:34.312
according to my wife.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.513
What I don't get

18:35.548 --> 18:36.914
is why a New Yorker would come
here to open a restaurant.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.417
[Matthew]
She's in the business.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.252
Graduated culinary school
top of her class.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.054
It's always been her dream
to have her own place.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.090
Well, then she knows
exactly what's she's in for.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.458
Are you worried?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.093
No.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.027
Do you have any idea

18:50.063 --> 18:51.329
how many new restaurants

18:51.364 --> 18:52.930
go out of business
in their first year?

18:52.966 --> 18:54.298
40%.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.468
You still didn't
answer my question.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.439
Back-hand drills, girls.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.008
Back-hand drills.
Let's go.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.016
Hey.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.317
Someone's been busy.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.385
Mm-hmm.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.786
Doing your due diligence?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.655
So, are you any closer
to making a decision?

19:17.690 --> 19:20.992
Well, I canvassed almost
every restaurant in town.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.827
Now, the palate

19:22.862 --> 19:25.363
seems to definitely be skewed
towards comfort food.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.898
Now, I feel like
they're ready for it

19:26.933 --> 19:29.333
in a more elevated form,
you know?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.168
Now, I know I'm biased,

19:30.203 --> 19:31.369
but I feel that's exactly

19:31.404 --> 19:32.570
what the town
has been crying out for.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.471
Now, the question is,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.039
how fast can I turn
this place around?

19:35.074 --> 19:36.107
About that.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.309
Things may have gotten
a little more complicated.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.343
This morning,
I got a phone call

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
from a coffeehouse chain
regarding the property.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.747
Oh, no...

19:42.782 --> 19:44.048
[Christina] Don't get nervous.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.049
It was just one inquiry.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.251
But if you're really serious
about doing this,

19:47.287 --> 19:48.519
then you need to move fast.

19:49.956 --> 19:50.821
Okay, I'll figure this out.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.524
And, Gabby,
if this doesn't feel right,

19:53.560 --> 19:54.458
for whatever reason,

19:54.494 --> 19:55.860
I am sure something better
will come along.

19:55.895 --> 19:56.861
Yeah, well,

19:56.896 --> 19:59.030
that's just something
people tell themselves

19:59.065 --> 20:01.566
to take the sting
out of life's disappointments.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.967
Well, then get to work.

20:03.903 --> 20:04.869
I will.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.708
Gabby, I can see that
the place is full of potential,

20:10.743 --> 20:13.010
but what's important here
is what does your gut tell you.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.413
<i> I want to take the leap,</i>
<i> but I'm scared.</i>

20:15.448 --> 20:16.347
[Chef] You should be.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.885
Look, fear can either push us
or hold us back,

20:20.920 --> 20:21.886
but in the end,

20:21.921 --> 20:22.954
what we regret
are the chances we never took.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.555
You're right, Chef.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.556
You need to ask yourself,

20:25.592 --> 20:27.625
is this a regret
that I'm willing to live with

20:27.660 --> 20:29.860
or is this a chance
that you're ready to take.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.763
Okay.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.764
Thanks, Chef.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.899
<i> No problem.</i>

20:46.112 --> 20:47.712
[Danny] Customer.

20:50.850 --> 20:51.782
Back again?

20:51.818 --> 20:53.751
Yes.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.785
This time with an appetite.

20:54.821 --> 20:55.786
Well, would you like
to take a look at the menu

20:55.822 --> 20:58.389
or do you have it memorized
from yesterday?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.557
I don't.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.993
Need to look at a menu, I mean.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.928
I would like to have
the specialty of the house.

21:04.998 --> 21:05.863
I beg your pardon?

21:05.898 --> 21:08.566
Whatever it is
this place is famous for.

21:10.336 --> 21:11.335
Your best dish.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.137
[dings order up bell]

21:13.172 --> 21:16.073
[Caleb] Well, that would have
to be our smoked brisket.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.441
Isn't that right, Danny?

21:17.477 --> 21:18.476
I'm staying out of this.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.512
[Trevor] It's our top seller.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.247
We marinate the meat
for two days,

21:23.283 --> 21:26.817
then slow roast it
to perfection.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.386
That's it.
Sounds good.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.289
I'll get it started.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.824
And your usual ice tea?

21:37.530 --> 21:38.462
Not-so-watery.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.633
Let me see...

21:46.339 --> 21:48.172
<i> Salud.</i>

21:55.381 --> 21:56.280
Just the check, please.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.117
That's it?

22:00.153 --> 22:01.652
You're not going to tell us
what you think?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.454
You said it's the best.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.689
It doesn't matter what I think.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.590
Sure, but you're, like,
a real chef.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.030
Gentlemen...

22:13.066 --> 22:14.832
you have got yourselves...

22:14.867 --> 22:17.535
a very...

22:17.570 --> 22:18.803
tasty dish.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.140
And...

22:23.176 --> 22:25.443
some new competition
down the street.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.646
Hmm...

22:28.681 --> 22:30.481
Well, then I guess

22:30.516 --> 22:31.949
there's really
only one thing left to say.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.353
Game on.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.301
It's your basic
one-year lease

22:50.336 --> 22:53.003
with option to extend
for another four.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.239
So what are your plans
for the renovations?

22:55.274 --> 22:57.108
Well, I am re-purposing
most of what's already there

22:57.143 --> 22:57.675
and then I want
to open the doors

22:57.710 --> 22:58.943
by the end of the month.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.711
Once I start turning a profit,

23:00.747 --> 23:02.246
I'm going to invest
in more improvements.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.347
[Christina] Impressive.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.149
Sounds like you have a plan
and an admirable goal.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.386
And a long road ahead of me
before I get there.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.221
Well, every journey
starts with a single step.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.722
Or in this case,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.858
with a signature
at the bottom of the page.

23:17.463 --> 23:18.496
Here goes nothing.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.435
Congratulations.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.503
The place is yours.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.074
Have you settled on a name
for the new restaurant?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.776
No. I've got a few ideas,

23:31.811 --> 23:33.310
but nothing has stuck
with me just yet.

23:33.346 --> 23:34.812
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something you love.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.147
Until then--

23:36.182 --> 23:37.748
I couldn't be
more proud of you.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.584
I'm so excited for you, Gabby.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.585
Thanks, sis.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.821
You know, for the first time
in a long time,

23:43.856 --> 23:45.423
I can honestly say...

23:45.458 --> 23:46.390
I am, too.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.662
I see
the Lewiston Falls Orioles

23:51.697 --> 23:53.130
made it to the playoffs.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.232
If you can manage
to squeeze one more win,

23:55.268 --> 23:57.334
the Blue Jays
will finally face them.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.470
What do you mean if,
it's practically in the bag.

23:59.505 --> 24:01.272
[bell dings]

24:01.307 --> 24:02.139
That would be huge.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.441
Lewiston Falls
has won the championship

24:03.476 --> 24:04.408
for the last four years.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.110
[Caleb] Exactly.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.578
The time is ripe for an upset.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.113
[Danny] And if your brother
doesn't win tomorrow,

24:09.148 --> 24:10.648
he's gonna be upset.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.450
[door bells jingling]

24:12.485 --> 24:13.451
[Emily] Hey, Dad.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.452
Hey, sweetie.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.753
I thought you two
were heading to the movies?

24:15.788 --> 24:16.821
It was sold out.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.255
We were wondering
if it was okay

24:18.291 --> 24:19.590
if we went over
to my Aunt Gabby's

24:19.625 --> 24:20.758
to help her fix up
her restaurant.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.126
Just until softball practice?

24:24.997 --> 24:26.430
Sure. Have fun.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.598
Thanks, Dad.

24:27.633 --> 24:28.532
Okay.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.669
I really hope Gabby knows
what she's in for.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.838
From what I can tell,
she seems pretty determined.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.306
Yeah, well, she's going to need
a lot more than determination

24:35.341 --> 24:36.540
to make a go of it.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.609
Are you worried she might take
a bite our of your business?

24:39.912 --> 24:42.046
Danny, do I look like
a guy who's worried?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.382
I think that woman has
a real fire inside her.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.017
I find it refreshing.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.386
Yeah, Caleb,
she's just following her dreams.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.323
You remember what those are,
don't you?

25:03.769 --> 25:05.870
[Emily] What are you naming
your restaurant?

25:05.905 --> 25:06.871
I haven't decided yet.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.241
I'm waiting for something
to leap out at me.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.775
How about "Aunt Gabby's"?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.745
I'll take that
under advisement.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.546
Mom said Nana would let you

25:15.581 --> 25:17.214
help her make dinner
every night.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.483
Yes, she did,
as a matter of fact,

25:19.519 --> 25:21.485
but her speciality was baking.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.722
Cookies, cupcakes,
all sorts of pastries.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.957
She was amazing.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.993
Emily, does your dad
let you bake?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.227
Not really.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.295
He's usually pushes me

25:31.330 --> 25:33.097
to do my homework
or play softball.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.766
He certainly has
a love for the game, huh?

25:35.801 --> 25:37.301
That's for sure.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.736
Me, not so much.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.938
[Gabby] Why not?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.406
She's afraid to strike out.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.043
Usually, I just stand there,
hoping to get a walk.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.648
You know, that may sound like
a good idea,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.816
but you're only
cheating yourself...

25:52.852 --> 25:54.084
and your teammates.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.320
But what if I really am bad?

25:56.355 --> 25:59.123
So?

25:59.158 --> 26:01.892
It's better than
not giving it your all, right?

26:04.630 --> 26:07.631
Listen. Back when I first
went into culinary school,

26:07.667 --> 26:08.732
I discovered

26:08.768 --> 26:10.367
that one of the requirements
to be able to graduate

26:10.403 --> 26:14.672
was that I had to bake
the perfect souffle.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.174
Now, that is an incredibly
complex dish to get right--

26:17.209 --> 26:19.443
and I rarely got it right.

26:19.478 --> 26:20.544
Seriously?

26:20.580 --> 26:22.313
Yeah, you can cook anything.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.148
Now maybe...

26:24.183 --> 26:25.616
but back then, forget it.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.851
My baking skills
were underwhelming.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.453
So for the next two years,

26:29.488 --> 26:31.789
me and the souffle
became mortal enemies.

26:32.858 --> 26:33.891
Now, deep inside,

26:33.926 --> 26:36.527
I knew I had the skill set,

26:36.562 --> 26:39.630
but I allowed my fear of failure
to get the best of me.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.166
So, what happened?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.201
So, one day,

26:44.236 --> 26:49.039
I decided that I was going
to either fail spectacularly

26:49.075 --> 26:50.074
or I was going to make

26:50.109 --> 26:52.042
the very best souffle
the chef had ever seen.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.511
And?

26:56.082 --> 26:57.281
Nailed it!

27:01.187 --> 27:03.153
Looks like somebody
has been industrious.

27:03.189 --> 27:04.288
Yeah.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.357
I still have a lot of work to do
before I open next week.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.427
Wow, you really are looking
to make a fast turnaround.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.161
I hate to steal away
your workers,

27:11.197 --> 27:13.597
but we have practice to get to.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.733
Aw, do we have to?
We're having fun.

27:15.768 --> 27:16.900
[Gabby] It's okay, Emily.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.036
You girls are welcome
to come back any time you want.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.371
[Emily] Really?

27:20.406 --> 27:23.540
If your dad is okay with it.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.143
Of course.

27:31.584 --> 27:32.583
[Gabby] Thank you so much.

27:32.618 --> 27:33.884
You're welcome.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.488
All right, girls, let's go.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.125
Dad, do you know
how to bake a souffle?

27:41.160 --> 27:44.161
Because my Aunt Gabby knows
how to bake the perfect souffle.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.097
Oh, does she now?

27:51.404 --> 27:53.070
All right, let's go.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.276
You work so hard

27:59.311 --> 28:01.078
and still manage
to look so refreshed.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.713
How do you do it?

28:02.748 --> 28:04.648
Because I thrive
under pressure.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.150
I heard Emily and Sophia

28:06.185 --> 28:07.551
helped out
at the restaurant today.

28:07.586 --> 28:08.786
[Gabby] They did.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.554
And they were so sweet.

28:10.589 --> 28:11.555
You know,
I wanted to ask you.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.458
I assume Emily's mom
and Caleb are divorced?

28:14.493 --> 28:16.393
Yes. Five years now.

28:16.429 --> 28:19.096
They met when Caleb was playing
in the Minor Leagues.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.130
[Gabby] Really?

28:20.166 --> 28:21.432
Then I guess Caleb

28:21.467 --> 28:23.667
must have been as good
as he says he was.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.836
[Christina]
Yes. And then some.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.905
So what made him get into
the restaurant business?

28:27.940 --> 28:29.506
[Christina] He didn't really
have much of a choice.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.507
When his father took ill,

28:30.543 --> 28:32.910
he had to put his dream
of going pro on hold

28:32.945 --> 28:34.011
and take over the restaurant.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.680
Then when his father passed,

28:36.716 --> 28:38.482
he and his wife decided
to start a family

28:38.517 --> 28:39.917
and he was left
with the business.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.318
And he never went back
to baseball?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.321
His first true love.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.823
He doesn't talk about it much,

28:45.858 --> 28:47.591
but I'm sure
there's some regret.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.461
What about Emily's mom?

28:50.496 --> 28:52.496
[Christina] She remarried
and moved to Boston.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.198
Caleb gets Emily
during the summer,

28:54.233 --> 28:55.566
and winter and spring break.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.369
You know,
I bet that can't be easy.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.637
Caleb's not one to complain.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.874
Not like we were raised--

29:03.909 --> 29:06.143
always wearing
our hearts on our sleeves.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.613
Speaking of hearts...

29:09.648 --> 29:10.948
I've got something
I want to show you.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.150
Okay.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.358
I brought down

29:21.393 --> 29:23.393
our photo albums
from the attic.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.963
I haven't looked at these
since mom passed away.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.866
[Gabby] Wow.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.200
These takes me back.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.337
Aw...

29:33.372 --> 29:35.038
I miss her so much.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.440
[Christina] I know. Me too.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.143
Mom had such
an indelible spirit.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.377
Yeah...

29:40.412 --> 29:41.812
A passion for cooking

29:41.847 --> 29:43.514
and putting together
large family gatherings.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.384
She could really
light up a room.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.385
She really was one-of-a-kind.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.194
I just got an idea.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.396
What if I name the restaurant
after Mom?

30:01.700 --> 30:03.033
Yeah...

30:03.068 --> 30:04.001
Let's call it...

30:04.036 --> 30:05.235
"Grace"?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.005
I love it.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.240
Mom would be so proud.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.675
[Gabby] Plus, I'd feel like
she'd be watching over me.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.011
Stop.
You're going to make me cry.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.045
She was so beautiful.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.280
-Look at that.
-I know.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.381
[door opens]

30:17.416 --> 30:19.049
Hey, guys!

30:19.084 --> 30:20.884
Hope you're hungry
because we are starving.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.086
Natalie's mom forgot
to bring snacks today

30:23.122 --> 30:24.788
after practice.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.089
So what do you want to eat?
I'll get started.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.560
No. Dad and I decided to cook
to give you guys the night off.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.594
I like the sound of that.

30:30.629 --> 30:31.528
What's on the menu?

30:33.098 --> 30:34.031
Frozen pizza!

30:34.967 --> 30:37.334
No one can warm up an oven
like my husband.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.408
Step on up.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.710
Alright, now we have...

30:46.745 --> 30:48.111
all the ingredients.

30:48.147 --> 30:48.946
So what's the first step?

30:48.981 --> 30:50.747
Melt butter
in a separate sauce pan.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.717
Check. Now what?

30:53.752 --> 30:55.185
Separate the eggs.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.922
Okay... separate the eggs...

31:00.492 --> 31:02.593
One,

31:02.628 --> 31:03.894
two,

31:03.929 --> 31:05.729
three, and four.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.798
Okay, what's next?

31:07.833 --> 31:09.066
That's not what it means!

31:09.101 --> 31:11.902
I know,
I'm just playing with you.

31:11.937 --> 31:14.771
Okay, here's what we do.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.307
We're going to crack the egg.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.209
We're going to separate
the white from the yolk.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.479
We're going to crack it
in the middle...

31:22.514 --> 31:24.448
open it up...

31:24.483 --> 31:27.584
shift it side to side
to separate the white...

31:27.620 --> 31:29.653
and you throw the yolk in there.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.221
You want to take a crack at it?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.257
Dad.

31:40.532 --> 31:41.732
Look at you.
Nice job.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.533
Alright, we just need two more,
and we can start whisking.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.868
Okay.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.770
But Gabby says
this is really complicated.

31:46.805 --> 31:47.638
What if we mess up?

31:47.673 --> 31:50.674
I got two dozen more eggs
right there.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.476
We've got this.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.479
Okay.

31:57.850 --> 31:58.682
[Caleb] Look at you.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.317
You sure you haven't
done this before?

32:00.352 --> 32:01.885
-Yes.
-Never?

32:01.921 --> 32:05.022
Dad, you know I haven't
done this before.

32:05.057 --> 32:05.989
You're so good.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.324
You're going to make
a great little baker.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.292
Thanks.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.500
So until we build
dy clientele,

32:16.535 --> 32:18.302
it will just be
me and you in the kitchen,

32:18.337 --> 32:20.971
so I need someone who really
thrives under pressure.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.105
Then I'm your man.

32:22.141 --> 32:25.275
Good, because that is exactly
what I needed to hear.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.578
What do you say,
you start this afternoon?

32:29.648 --> 32:30.981
Wait... So I've got the job?

32:31.016 --> 32:32.616
I need to get the kitchen
up and running

32:32.651 --> 32:34.685
so I can pass inspection
for the opening tomorrow.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.119
Got it.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.087
Well, you can count on me, Chef.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.091
Can you say that again?
Just the last part.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.326
Chef?

32:44.997 --> 32:46.263
Yeah.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.999
Chef. Okay.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.337
Taste it.

32:53.372 --> 32:54.671
What is it?

32:54.707 --> 32:55.772
It's a cheese souffle.

32:55.808 --> 32:56.807
What's in it?

32:56.842 --> 32:58.775
Cheese, eggs, butter...

32:58.811 --> 32:59.810
Just taste it.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.278
It's not going to bite you.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.847
Come on.

33:10.923 --> 33:11.855
Well?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.325
Not bad.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.827
Yeah...

33:16.862 --> 33:17.694
Light and airy.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.496
Took me half the night
to get it right.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.164
Look, it got me thinking,

33:21.200 --> 33:22.966
maybe it's time
we expand our menu.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.502
To include souffles?

33:25.537 --> 33:27.137
No, this is way too froufrou
for our crowd.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.638
Speak for yourself.

33:30.676 --> 33:31.875
I've got to say,

33:31.910 --> 33:33.643
I'm just a little surprised
at your willingness to change.

33:33.679 --> 33:34.811
Aren't you the guy
who always told me,

33:34.847 --> 33:36.146
"If it's not broken,
don't fix it?"

33:36.181 --> 33:37.814
Well, people can change.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.549
This wouldn't happen
to be motivated

33:39.585 --> 33:41.585
by the new competition starting
up down the street, would it?

33:41.620 --> 33:43.353
No.

33:43.389 --> 33:44.388
No, I just think

33:44.423 --> 33:45.655
Gabby made me realize

33:45.691 --> 33:46.523
that I've let myself

33:46.558 --> 33:48.592
get a little complacent
around here.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.760
[Danny]
I wasn't going to say anything,

33:49.795 --> 33:52.696
but the burgers have been
a little on the dry side lately.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.932
I really like
seeing this new side of you.

33:55.968 --> 33:57.034
Thanks.

33:57.069 --> 33:58.935
And I think competition is good,

33:58.971 --> 34:00.871
but it means we need
to step up our game.

34:00.906 --> 34:03.040
In that case,
I've got six words for you.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.041
Sweet Potato fries.

34:04.076 --> 34:06.543
With garlic aioli.

34:06.578 --> 34:07.411
That's six words.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.678
You know what,
just come to the back.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.746
I'm going to show you.

34:09.782 --> 34:10.781
[Danny]
Can I have your souffle?

34:10.816 --> 34:11.882
[Trevor]
Yeah, knock yourself out.

34:11.917 --> 34:13.050
Here you go.

34:13.085 --> 34:13.984
Thank you, sir.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.357
You're gonna see.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.226
Garlic oil.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.467
And the cheese

34:30.502 --> 34:32.502
give the fries
a real rustic flavor...

34:34.406 --> 34:36.706
...that is pretty near
irresistible.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.184
Ta-dah!

34:56.795 --> 34:58.295
-Wow.
-Wow?

34:58.330 --> 35:00.430
-Wow.
-Wow!

35:00.466 --> 35:02.499
I mean, this--
this could be a game changer.

35:02.534 --> 35:03.733
Yeah, I think so, too.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.079
I see you're closing in
on the finish line.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.448
I just need to pass
my final health inspection

35:18.484 --> 35:20.083
to open tomorrow night.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.252
The girls were hoping

35:22.287 --> 35:23.587
you could make it
to their big game.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.688
If we win today,

35:24.723 --> 35:25.655
we make it
to the championship game.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.324
Wow.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.992
Well, I promise to be there

35:29.027 --> 35:30.961
the moment I am done
with the Health Inspector.

35:30.996 --> 35:31.828
Now, in the meantime,

35:31.864 --> 35:33.396
I made the snacks
for after the game.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.599
I don't know
where you find the time.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.766
Thank you.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.835
Emily, do you want to come
with me and get the snacks?

35:38.871 --> 35:41.638
-Just a minute.
-Yeah.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.273
-This looks great.
-It looks amazing.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.509
[Gabby] So I know today's game
is really important,

35:45.544 --> 35:46.877
so I hope you thought about

35:46.912 --> 35:47.744
what I said to you
the other day.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.480
I'm still scared
of disappointing my dad.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.982
Okay.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.150
Do you know who Babe Ruth was?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.951
Of course.
The Great Bambino.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.620
Why did I have to ask?

35:57.990 --> 35:59.823
So do you know
that he used to say

35:59.858 --> 36:01.525
"Never let the fear
of striking out

36:01.560 --> 36:02.893
keep you
from playing the game."

36:02.928 --> 36:03.994
Does that make sense to you?

36:05.697 --> 36:07.130
Good.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.232
Now get out there
and give it your best.

36:09.268 --> 36:10.634
-Okay, you promise?
-I promise.

36:10.669 --> 36:11.535
-Great.
-Thanks.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.174
Okay, let's talk about
the menu for tomorrow.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.043
I'm thinking about starting
with a simple menu

36:20.078 --> 36:22.212
of seafood empanadillas
and flank steak.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.980
Yes, Chef--

36:24.016 --> 36:24.948
but before that,

36:24.983 --> 36:26.016
I think you need to look
at the refrigerator.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.385
Why? What's the problem?

36:28.420 --> 36:30.387
I set the temperature
to 40 degrees,

36:30.422 --> 36:32.856
but the spinach and the lettuce
have already started to wilt.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.429
See?

36:39.464 --> 36:41.398
This shouldn't be happening.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.500
Well, there's the problem.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.869
We have a Health Inspector
coming any minute.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.103
Find me a Phillips screwdriver.

36:47.139 --> 36:48.538
Get me a flashlight, please.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.874
And, Victoria, get this
out of here, like now.

36:50.909 --> 36:51.841
Yes, Chef.

36:53.645 --> 36:54.744
You got it?

36:54.780 --> 36:56.079
Okay. Open it.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.450
Give me some light.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.352
Now, you see, Sergio,

37:02.387 --> 37:04.588
this trip switch
overrides the defrost timer.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.723
So, you...

37:06.758 --> 37:08.325
[fridge humming]

37:09.728 --> 37:11.294
There you go.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.829
It should cool down
in about 20 minutes.

37:13.966 --> 37:14.931
Way to go, Chef.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.032
You really are unflappable.

37:16.068 --> 37:19.402
Well, I know a thing or two
about kitchen disasters.

37:19.438 --> 37:22.072
Although based on the age
of this refrigerator,

37:22.107 --> 37:25.041
I think my quick fix is going
to turn into a costly upgrade.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.309
Well, let's hope
she's got enough life

37:26.345 --> 37:27.277
to get us through our opening.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.745
And a little beyond.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.280
[Victoria] Uh, Chef...

37:30.315 --> 37:31.381
The Health Inspector is here.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.719
Okay, we just need
to buy some time.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.988
Tell him that I'm on the phone
with a vendor

37:38.023 --> 37:39.823
and I'll be right out.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.391
[Victoria] I'm a terrible liar.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.527
Oh. Okay.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.432
[dialing]

37:52.304 --> 37:53.903
Hi, Acme Produce?

37:53.939 --> 37:54.904
Yeah, this is Gabby,
from Grace restaurant.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.905
Correct.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.841
[mouths words]

37:57.876 --> 37:59.242
Yeah, I have an emergency here.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.011
Can you please send, like,
at least two pounds

38:01.046 --> 38:03.680
of arugula, spinach,
Romaine, and Butter Lettuce.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.982
No, I need it, like,
10 minutes, please.

38:14.126 --> 38:14.991
Way to go, Blue Jays.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.697
Let's go, girls.
Bring it in, bring it in.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.098
Caleb really pulled it off.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.033
The girls made the championship.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.334
Now all they need to do

38:24.369 --> 38:25.969
is beat their rivals,
the Orioles.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.438
One game at a time, Danny.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.173
Don't tell me.
You didn't pass inspection?

38:30.208 --> 38:31.841
No, I did.
Barely, but we did.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.009
Congratulations.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.144
Everyone wins today.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.446
I'm sorry I missed the game.
I came as fast I could.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.814
You made it.
That's all that matters.

38:37.849 --> 38:38.815
I'm so glad.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.183
[cheering]

38:42.154 --> 38:43.553
Don't leave
your coach hanging.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.288
Don't leave me hanging.
Don't leave me hanging.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.696
Girls, these are
the new special at Delaney's.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.232
I thought it was our day
to bring the snacks.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.334
It is.

38:57.369 --> 38:58.802
Maybe Caleb got confused.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.970
Or maybe he couldn't resist
the chance to one-up me.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.008
Care to try our newest recipe?

39:05.043 --> 39:06.309
I'm good, thanks.

39:06.345 --> 39:07.977
Looks like you forgot
the snack schedule.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.848
Oops, I'm sorry.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.216
I'm curious.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.818
This competitive streak.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.487
Is it an occupational hazard
or just your nature?

39:17.522 --> 39:19.356
I guess a bit of both,
actually.

39:20.926 --> 39:21.958
I can't seem to help myself.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.194
Well, in that case,
I've got some news for you.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.096
I passed the health inspection

39:26.131 --> 39:27.464
and I'm opening doors
tomorrow night.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.333
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.801
So what are you calling
your restaurant?

39:32.771 --> 39:34.471
-Grace.
-Huh.

39:47.252 --> 39:50.220
Told you the sweet potato fries
would be a huge crowd pleaser.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.355
With everyone except Gabby.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.958
She seems to think
all I want to do is one-up her.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.860
Well, you sort of are
a serial one-upper.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.095
Yeah, I guess so,

39:59.131 --> 40:00.730
but she seems to really
bring it out of me in spades.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.603
Caleb Delaney, right?

40:06.638 --> 40:08.104
Yeah, do I know you?

40:08.140 --> 40:10.473
No, Bennett Chambers.

40:10.509 --> 40:11.741
I was a freshman
at Bright Shore High

40:11.777 --> 40:13.209
back when you played
for the Bisons.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.246
I just remember
you had an arm like a cannon.

40:17.449 --> 40:18.415
I couldn't help but come out

40:18.450 --> 40:19.949
and see if you coached
as good as you played.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.785
I certainly got my answer today.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.653
Appreciate the support.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.655
Anyway, I teach
9th-grade English

40:25.690 --> 40:26.689
at Bright Shore now.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.259
Did you guys hear
Coach Ryan retired this year?

40:29.294 --> 40:31.127
No way.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.495
He said the only way he'd leave

40:32.531 --> 40:33.897
is if they carried him
out on a stretcher.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.266
His wife
got tired of the winters

40:36.301 --> 40:37.867
and wanted to retire to Florida.

40:38.970 --> 40:39.769
Any idea who's taking the spot?

40:42.174 --> 40:44.974
No, but the team definitely
could use some fresh blood.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.312
You should talk
to the Principal about it,

40:51.149 --> 40:52.916
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.084
You sure?

40:55.120 --> 40:56.953
[Trevor]
Yeah, Caleb, he's right.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.421
Why don't you at least
think about it?

40:59.524 --> 41:00.957
I think I'll pass.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.158
Thanks for coming out.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.793
-Pleasure to meet you.
-You too.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.779
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thank you.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.646
Uh...

41:23.682 --> 41:25.348
those are not
the mushrooms I ordered.

41:25.383 --> 41:26.649
Those are Portobello.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.151
I specifically asked
for Shiitake Mushrooms

41:28.186 --> 41:29.185
for my flank steak.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.487
I know, Chef.

41:30.522 --> 41:32.188
Acme Produce
delivered these by mistake.

41:32.224 --> 41:33.723
When I called to complain,
they said they were out.

41:33.758 --> 41:34.557
What do you want to do?

41:34.593 --> 41:36.726
I want to serve
Shiitake Mushrooms

41:36.761 --> 41:37.961
with my flank steak.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.028
Uh...

41:42.767 --> 41:43.666
It's okay.
I've got this.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.487
Well...

42:04.523 --> 42:06.256
I almost thought
you were trying to avoid me.

42:06.291 --> 42:08.391
Whatever gave you
that impression?

42:08.426 --> 42:09.359
Excuse me.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.028
[Caleb] Don't go. Please.

42:12.063 --> 42:15.298
Look, I'm extending
the olive branch.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.901
-Or olive spread, anyway.
-Really?

42:17.936 --> 42:19.335
[Caleb] Yeah.

42:19.371 --> 42:22.038
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

42:22.073 --> 42:25.408
Honestly I wasn't trying
to one-up your snack yesterday.

42:25.443 --> 42:26.376
I guess I just got
a little excited

42:26.411 --> 42:28.378
with Trevor's new creation
in the kitchen.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.282
The truth is,
this whole self-improvement kick

42:32.317 --> 42:33.883
was something you inspired.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.419
I beg your pardon?

42:36.454 --> 42:37.420
Yeah. The other day,

42:37.455 --> 42:38.421
Emily came home and asked

42:38.456 --> 42:39.389
if I knew how to make
the perfect souffle--

42:39.424 --> 42:40.623
like you.

42:40.659 --> 42:41.758
Oh, and you couldn't resist,
could you?

42:41.793 --> 42:42.825
Do you have any idea

42:42.861 --> 42:45.295
how many eggs we went through
to get that right?

42:45.330 --> 42:47.931
I don't know whether to be
touched or annoyed.

42:49.334 --> 42:50.600
Go with touched, please.

42:51.736 --> 42:52.502
It turned out to be

42:52.537 --> 42:53.903
a really great
bonding experience

42:53.939 --> 42:54.938
for me and Emily.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.040
I could tell it was.

42:58.410 --> 42:59.375
You're welcome.

43:02.147 --> 43:03.279
Leaving so soon?

43:03.315 --> 43:04.614
I just have to--

43:04.649 --> 43:05.715
I have to go back
to the restaurant

43:05.750 --> 43:08.051
so I can continue prepping
for my opening, remember?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.652
Right.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.321
Well, I mean, you can't--

43:11.356 --> 43:12.488
you can't go without trying

43:12.524 --> 43:14.057
Cousin Lucille's
famous Lemonade.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.730
I have to go.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.231
Look, there's nothing like it

43:22.267 --> 43:23.700
to take the edge off
on a hot summer day.

43:26.438 --> 43:27.870
Nothing.

43:29.341 --> 43:30.239
So, I'm curious.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.507
What made you decide

43:31.543 --> 43:32.909
to go to culinary school
and become a chef?

43:35.947 --> 43:38.147
Well, I guess a big reason was

43:38.183 --> 43:40.016
because my fondest
childhood memories

43:40.051 --> 43:42.251
were always in the kitchen.

43:42.287 --> 43:45.188
Whether it was baking
or cooking with my mom,

43:45.223 --> 43:46.689
or simply gathering around
the table

43:46.725 --> 43:47.824
with my family for dinner,

43:47.859 --> 43:49.792
food was always

43:49.828 --> 43:51.928
that one element
to bring us together.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.163
Wow.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.133
-What?
-Nothing.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.701
It's an amazing answer.

43:58.737 --> 43:59.836
I never thought about it
like that.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.204
[Gabby] Think about it.

44:01.239 --> 44:03.973
The smell of cookies
baking in the oven,

44:04.009 --> 44:06.709
you know, a Thanksgiving turkey
roasting to perfection,

44:06.745 --> 44:08.111
the smell of bacon
frying in a pan.

44:08.146 --> 44:09.178
Stop.

44:09.214 --> 44:10.446
You're making me hungry.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.183
Well, on that note,

44:14.219 --> 44:16.619
thank you for my lemonade
and the olive spread,

44:16.655 --> 44:18.454
but I...

44:18.490 --> 44:19.522
I really have to get
back to work.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.824
[Caleb] Yeah.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.660
Gabby, I want to wish you luck
with your opening tonight.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.161
Thank you.

44:25.196 --> 44:27.030
-I mean it.
-Yeah.

44:45.450 --> 44:46.382
[bell dings]

44:48.520 --> 44:49.886
[bell dings]

44:52.190 --> 44:53.756
[bell dings]
Well, what do you think?

44:53.792 --> 44:54.891
It's great,

44:54.926 --> 44:55.825
but you sure we can still
turn a profit at this price?

44:55.860 --> 44:56.926
Yeah, it's like
all-you-can-eat pancakes.

44:56.961 --> 44:59.362
You can only eat so many wings
before you fill up.

45:00.432 --> 45:01.431
Right. Good point.

45:01.466 --> 45:02.398
I'll tell you what,

45:02.434 --> 45:03.399
Let's keep the special
going through dinner

45:03.435 --> 45:05.034
and then see if it keeps up
the foot traffic.

45:06.571 --> 45:07.537
[Emily] Hey, Dad.

45:07.572 --> 45:09.105
[Caleb] Hey, kiddo.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.373
Practice isn't until 4:30.

45:10.408 --> 45:11.340
I know.

45:11.376 --> 45:12.508
I was hoping to go play catch?

45:12.544 --> 45:14.444
With me?

45:14.479 --> 45:15.745
Yes, silly!

45:15.780 --> 45:17.580
We got this.

45:17.615 --> 45:19.348
Go play catch
with your daughter.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.450
-You sure?
-Yeah.

45:20.485 --> 45:21.884
Let's go.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.055
Who loves these wings?

45:26.091 --> 45:27.490
[cheering]

45:31.663 --> 45:33.529
As much as I love
this new side of you,

45:33.565 --> 45:34.397
what inspired

45:34.432 --> 45:35.565
your change of heart
about softball?

45:35.600 --> 45:37.033
Is it because our team

45:37.068 --> 45:39.402
stands a real chance
at winning the championship?

45:39.437 --> 45:40.436
No...

45:40.472 --> 45:41.704
it was something
Gabby said to me.

45:41.740 --> 45:42.805
Never let the fear
of striking out

45:42.841 --> 45:44.207
keep you from playing the game.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.943
Gabby actually quoted
Babe Ruth?

45:46.978 --> 45:47.777
She said
if I don't try my best,

45:47.812 --> 45:49.879
I'm failing myself
and my teammates.

45:51.683 --> 45:53.616
Those are
pretty wise words there, kiddo.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.785
Not just in softball,
but in life.

45:56.988 --> 45:58.287
Yeah, but we'll never
beat the Orioles

45:58.323 --> 45:59.756
if we don't practice.

45:59.791 --> 46:01.924
True. Get on out there.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.160
Here comes a pop fly.

46:04.195 --> 46:05.962
Watch it into the glove.
Nice!

46:05.997 --> 46:07.330
You got it.

46:07.365 --> 46:08.531
Good throw.

46:18.810 --> 46:19.909
Well, not exactly

46:19.944 --> 46:21.944
the stampede of guests
I was hoping for the opening.

46:23.014 --> 46:23.913
Relax, Chef.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.248
We opened our doors
barely an hour ago.

46:26.985 --> 46:28.417
Maybe it was a mistake

46:28.453 --> 46:30.119
not inviting our family
and friends to come out.

46:30.155 --> 46:31.621
Family and friends

46:31.656 --> 46:33.689
are not going to keep
the doors open, Victoria.

46:33.725 --> 46:34.957
Diners are.

46:34.993 --> 46:36.292
Wait, I think
I see somebody coming.

46:38.296 --> 46:39.796
Good evening
and welcome to Grace.

46:39.831 --> 46:40.763
Party of?

46:40.799 --> 46:41.731
None.

46:41.766 --> 46:43.599
Actually, I already ate
down at Delaney's.

46:43.635 --> 46:47.170
I just came by
to wish Gabby luck.

46:47.205 --> 46:49.372
Thanks, Danny.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.373
Are you sure you don't want
to sit down

46:50.408 --> 46:51.274
and take a look at the menu?

46:51.309 --> 46:52.508
Come on.

46:52.544 --> 46:55.011
That was my plan,
but I'm stuffed.

46:55.046 --> 46:55.812
Delaney's started running

46:55.847 --> 46:58.381
a bottomless
chicken wing special

46:58.416 --> 47:01.083
and the place is packed.

47:03.521 --> 47:04.587
Why am I not surprised?

47:11.529 --> 47:13.462
[Gabby] You know
what's the thing w

47:13.498 --> 47:15.498
He takes one step forward

47:15.533 --> 47:17.166
and then, like,
two huge ones back.

47:17.202 --> 47:18.835
Last night, my opening
took a backseat

47:18.870 --> 47:20.636
to his "bottomless wing"
promotion.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.406
Do you really think
he's doing it on purpose?

47:24.943 --> 47:26.609
Truthfully, with Caleb,
I wouldn't be surprised.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.512
I don't know.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.347
I think your enthusiasm
is rubbing off on him,

47:31.382 --> 47:32.815
which is why he's taking
such a new shine

47:32.851 --> 47:34.483
to his restaurant.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.285
Meaning
I'm good for his business?

47:36.321 --> 47:37.453
That's wonderful.

47:37.488 --> 47:38.688
What about mine?

47:38.723 --> 47:41.090
Well, Rome wasn't built
in a day,

47:41.125 --> 47:42.825
and nor did it collapse
that fast.

47:42.861 --> 47:43.826
You should be proud of yourself.

47:43.862 --> 47:45.795
You reached your goal.
You opened your doors.

47:45.830 --> 47:46.696
I know.

47:46.731 --> 47:49.465
You must have had
at least a few diners.

47:51.236 --> 47:52.635
I had maybe, like, a dozen.

47:52.670 --> 47:54.136
Well, that's a start.

47:54.172 --> 47:54.971
I know,

47:55.006 --> 47:56.939
but for Grace restaurant
to take off,

47:56.975 --> 47:58.207
I need, like,
a splash, you know,

47:58.243 --> 47:59.141
to get my name out there.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.680
You mean...

48:04.716 --> 48:05.848
something like this?

48:05.884 --> 48:07.283
What's this?

48:08.553 --> 48:10.052
Taste of Summer Festival?

48:10.088 --> 48:11.287
[Christina]
Yeah. It's a county event

48:11.322 --> 48:12.622
to help promote tourism.

48:12.657 --> 48:14.490
I'm on the Events committee
that started it.

48:14.525 --> 48:15.892
It's a real crowd pleaser.

48:15.927 --> 48:17.493
I bet.

48:17.528 --> 48:20.062
And a $10,000 grand prize--
that's incredible.

48:20.098 --> 48:21.163
Who decides on the winner?

48:21.199 --> 48:22.965
A handful of food critics.

48:23.001 --> 48:24.400
And the winner
gets a nice write-up

48:24.435 --> 48:26.402
in the Massachusetts
Food Journal.

48:26.437 --> 48:27.536
[Gabby] I wouldn't mind
a taste of that.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.639
Has Caleb's restaurant
ever won?

48:31.843 --> 48:33.175
To be honest...

48:33.211 --> 48:34.810
I don't remember
him ever participating.

48:34.846 --> 48:35.878
You're kidding me?

48:38.016 --> 48:40.149
Well, Caleb seemed to be
happy with the status quo--

48:40.184 --> 48:42.218
until you came along.

48:42.253 --> 48:43.619
Well, I hope
it stays that way.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.056
So, I'm assuming
you're entering the festival?

48:47.091 --> 48:48.357
Are you kidding me?

48:48.393 --> 48:49.592
Of course I'm entering.

48:49.627 --> 48:51.027
You know,
I could use that money,

48:51.062 --> 48:52.828
especially with a refrigerator
on life support.

48:52.864 --> 48:55.031
I see.

48:55.066 --> 48:57.033
You realize you have to win it
first, right, though?

48:57.068 --> 48:59.201
Details, details.

49:05.910 --> 49:08.678
[Caleb]
Early bird catches the worm.

49:08.713 --> 49:09.879
And breakfast is

49:09.914 --> 49:11.380
the most important meal
of the day.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.115
I am afraid
we don't serve breakfast,

49:13.151 --> 49:14.283
but there is
a cute little place

49:14.319 --> 49:15.418
down the way
that you might like.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.020
True, but, you know,

49:18.056 --> 49:19.588
I wanted to check out
the new hot spot in town.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.690
[Gabby] Hardly.

49:20.725 --> 49:22.358
Your daily special last night

49:22.393 --> 49:24.794
nearly turned my opening
into a mausoleum.

49:24.829 --> 49:26.329
-Thank you.
-Oops.

49:27.832 --> 49:30.466
Caleb, I actually have
a big day ahead of me,

49:30.501 --> 49:31.734
so I'm done.

49:31.769 --> 49:33.369
I do, too.

49:33.404 --> 49:34.804
First playoff game, which is--

49:34.839 --> 49:35.705
which is that's why I'm here.

49:37.141 --> 49:38.541
I heard about
the little pep talk

49:38.576 --> 49:40.142
you gave Emily
the other day.

49:40.178 --> 49:42.078
You really turned
her attitude around.

49:42.113 --> 49:43.145
It was nothing.

49:43.181 --> 49:45.014
No, it wasn't.
It meant a lot.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.184
Not just to Emily,
but to me, too.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.221
You know, you should do that
more often.

49:52.256 --> 49:53.756
Do what?

49:53.791 --> 49:54.890
Show a little humility.

49:56.361 --> 49:57.660
It goes a long way,

49:57.695 --> 49:59.428
and believe it or not,
you wear it well.

50:00.798 --> 50:01.731
I'll try and remember that.

50:03.167 --> 50:04.800
But I'm curious--

50:04.836 --> 50:05.634
a Babe Ruth quote?

50:05.670 --> 50:07.670
Caleb, just because
I love to cook

50:07.705 --> 50:09.238
doesn't mean I don't know
my baseball legends.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.074
Fine.

50:12.110 --> 50:13.843
Don't believe me.

50:13.878 --> 50:15.244
I have to go to work.

50:15.279 --> 50:16.145
Okay, then prove it.

50:17.148 --> 50:18.381
Prove it.

50:18.416 --> 50:21.384
I mean, name six of the greatest
baseball players of all time.

50:23.021 --> 50:25.421
Huh. What do I get in return?

50:25.456 --> 50:26.922
What do you want?

50:26.958 --> 50:28.758
Well, I am planning
a menu tasting

50:28.793 --> 50:30.026
later this evening,

50:30.061 --> 50:31.260
and I could use some help

50:31.295 --> 50:32.461
bringing some guests
to come out.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.497
Menu tasting?

50:34.532 --> 50:35.331
I want to try a few items

50:35.366 --> 50:36.899
so I can determine
a fan favorite.

50:38.002 --> 50:39.068
Like Delaney's smoked brisket.

50:40.638 --> 50:41.637
I think I can do that for you.

50:41.672 --> 50:43.272
If you can name

50:43.307 --> 50:46.342
six of the greatest
baseball legends of all time.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.376
Wow. Okay.

50:47.412 --> 50:48.811
That's going to be a tough one.
Let me think.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.447
Jackie Robinson, Mickey Mantle,

50:51.482 --> 50:52.882
Ty Cobb, Ted Williams,

50:52.917 --> 50:53.983
Hank Aaron, and Willie Mays.

50:54.018 --> 50:55.518
And I would like to throw in

50:55.553 --> 50:58.120
Roberto Clemente
for good measure.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.057
Tasting starts promptly
at 6:00,

51:01.092 --> 51:02.691
and the dress code
is summer casual.

51:09.901 --> 51:11.700
Okay, so to help celebrate
our second playoff win,

51:11.736 --> 51:13.803
make sure you come out
for a menu tasting at Grace,

51:13.838 --> 51:14.637
this new restaurant

51:14.672 --> 51:16.138
that opened up here
in Bright Shore.

51:16.174 --> 51:17.239
Okay?

51:17.275 --> 51:18.707
Alright, great job today.

51:18.743 --> 51:19.875
See you at the next practice.

51:23.281 --> 51:24.480
Wow.

51:24.515 --> 51:25.481
Do my ears defy me

51:25.516 --> 51:28.984
or did you just give
the competition a leg up?

51:29.020 --> 51:31.153
Well, if you must know,
Gabby asked me for a favor.

51:31.189 --> 51:32.521
Little Miss Independent?

51:32.557 --> 51:33.823
I don't think so.

51:33.858 --> 51:36.158
I don't care.
Think what you want.

51:36.194 --> 51:38.027
Okay.

51:38.062 --> 51:39.528
I think you lost a bet.

51:49.207 --> 51:50.039
Thank you for coming

51:50.074 --> 51:51.540
and giving us
your wonderful feedback.

51:51.576 --> 51:52.708
Thank you.

52:01.786 --> 52:03.085
[Gabby]
Thank you so much for coming.

52:04.555 --> 52:05.821
Good.

52:08.893 --> 52:09.792
Thank you.

52:09.827 --> 52:11.360
I'm going to get back
to the restaurant.

52:11.395 --> 52:12.728
Alright. I'll hang out here
for a little bit.

52:12.763 --> 52:14.530
-Gabby!
-How was it?

52:14.565 --> 52:15.464
-It was wonderful!
-Oh, good, good.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.900
-It was amazing.
-I'm so glad. I'm so glad.

52:17.935 --> 52:20.703
-I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

52:20.738 --> 52:23.105
-Everything was great.
-Good to hear.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.874
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.075
Tell me how this works again?

52:26.110 --> 52:27.109
Yes, yes.

52:27.145 --> 52:28.477
You put your red poker chips

52:28.513 --> 52:30.212
in the box
with your favorite dish

52:30.248 --> 52:31.413
and the black ones
in your least favorite.

52:33.918 --> 52:35.050
Sorry.

52:35.086 --> 52:35.885
I liked it all.

52:36.988 --> 52:38.087
-Great.
-But...

52:39.590 --> 52:41.991
just don't tell that
to the competition, okay?

52:42.026 --> 52:43.526
-Just between us.
-Alright.

52:46.264 --> 52:47.329
Thank you.

52:47.365 --> 52:48.430
I don't know which was better,

52:48.466 --> 52:49.298
your dishes

52:49.333 --> 52:50.799
or the crowd I managed
to pull together

52:50.835 --> 52:51.967
for your little shindig.

52:52.003 --> 52:55.538
You know, not everything
has to be a competition, Caleb.

52:58.376 --> 52:59.275
Growing up,

52:59.310 --> 53:02.111
my dad always pushed us
to be number one,

53:02.146 --> 53:04.113
so I applied that

53:04.148 --> 53:06.515
not only to baseball
but to every aspect of my life.

53:06.551 --> 53:07.950
You miss it, don't you?

53:09.854 --> 53:11.287
You know,
the restaurant business

53:11.322 --> 53:12.288
was always the fall-back plan.

53:12.323 --> 53:14.623
I enjoy it, don't get me wrong--

53:14.659 --> 53:16.926
It just wasn't
what you were meant to do.

53:18.729 --> 53:20.963
Why don't you try
something else?

53:20.998 --> 53:23.365
The million-dollar question.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.100
I've been asking myself that
a long time.

53:25.136 --> 53:28.671
You know, my mom used to say
life is what you make of it.

53:30.174 --> 53:34.777
That, and you have to make sure
you fulfill your potential.

53:34.812 --> 53:36.178
Now, there's
an intimidating prospect.

53:36.214 --> 53:37.012
It was for a long time.

53:37.048 --> 53:40.216
Until my chef
and mentor, Franco,

53:40.251 --> 53:41.850
said something
that really stuck with me.

53:43.721 --> 53:44.687
He said, in the end,

53:44.722 --> 53:46.755
you only regret
the chances you never took.

53:48.659 --> 53:50.759
Spoken like a man who's taken
his share of chances.

53:53.864 --> 53:55.331
Okay, the results are in.

53:57.435 --> 54:00.903
The number-one dish,
hands down, was...

54:00.938 --> 54:02.238
seafood empanadillas!

54:02.273 --> 54:03.706
I knew it.

54:05.676 --> 54:06.542
So that's definitely
what we should serve

54:06.577 --> 54:09.144
at this year's
Taste of Summer Festival.

54:09.180 --> 54:10.112
Right?

54:11.382 --> 54:12.248
Oh, I didn't know

54:12.283 --> 54:13.649
you were planning
to enter the Festival.

54:13.684 --> 54:14.917
Oh...

54:14.952 --> 54:15.985
yeah, yeah.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.219
I figured...
it would be fun.

54:18.923 --> 54:19.989
In that case...

54:20.024 --> 54:21.023
you know what,

54:21.058 --> 54:23.325
I think I will, too.

54:23.361 --> 54:24.560
Great.

54:24.595 --> 54:25.494
The more the merrier.

54:25.529 --> 54:26.895
Yeah.

54:36.574 --> 54:39.041
[Gabby] I was inches away
from a clean getaway,

54:39.076 --> 54:41.343
and then Victoria accidentally
spilled the beans to Caleb

54:41.379 --> 54:42.544
about the festival.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.480
So what
if he enters the festival?

54:44.515 --> 54:45.447
Do you really think

54:45.483 --> 54:47.316
his cuisine stands a chance
against yours?

54:47.351 --> 54:48.517
It's not even that.

54:48.552 --> 54:50.352
You know, I just feel that
we're finally in a good place.

54:50.388 --> 54:51.387
We're amicable.

54:51.422 --> 54:53.489
And now we're going to be
on opposing teams again.

54:53.524 --> 54:55.691
It's called
the "Taste of Summer Festival."

54:55.726 --> 54:57.393
Yes, there is
a competitive element to it,

54:57.428 --> 54:58.494
but, really,

54:58.529 --> 55:00.663
it's an opportunity for you
to showcase your food

55:00.698 --> 55:02.898
along with all the other
restaurants in the area.

55:02.933 --> 55:05.200
So we all walk away winners.

55:05.236 --> 55:07.069
[Christina] Essentially. Yes.

55:07.104 --> 55:09.004
Yeah, but only one restaurant
walks away with the grand prize.

55:10.374 --> 55:12.207
I don't know who's rubbing off
on who these days,

55:12.243 --> 55:13.542
but if you ask me,

55:13.577 --> 55:15.711
the two of you
are more alike than you think.

55:15.746 --> 55:17.379
Okay, let's go!

55:17.415 --> 55:19.081
[Christina] Here they are!
My little champions.

55:19.116 --> 55:21.016
If we beat the Orioles
at today's game,

55:21.052 --> 55:22.051
we win the pennant.

55:22.086 --> 55:24.019
How exciting!

55:24.055 --> 55:25.020
Are you nervous?

55:25.056 --> 55:26.221
Not really...

55:26.257 --> 55:27.189
but I'm pretty sure my dad is.

55:29.093 --> 55:29.992
Maybe just a little.

55:31.228 --> 55:32.261
Yes!

55:33.464 --> 55:37.566
Okay, welcome to Delaney's
first official staff meeting.

55:37.601 --> 55:39.234
Now, I'm hoping to make this
a staple around here

55:39.270 --> 55:40.803
because I've come to realize

55:40.838 --> 55:43.072
that we all
to step up our game--

55:43.107 --> 55:44.206
starting with yours truly.

55:45.943 --> 55:47.976
Now, Trevor's put some
amazing new things on the menu,

55:48.012 --> 55:48.944
which has got me thinking

55:48.979 --> 55:50.446
that the time is long overdue

55:50.481 --> 55:51.747
for us to participate

55:51.782 --> 55:53.215
in this year's
Taste of Summer Festival.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.118
Who still thinks our best dish
is the smoked brisket?

56:00.358 --> 56:02.224
While it's no doubt
a contender,

56:02.259 --> 56:03.158
I think we need
to push ourselves

56:03.194 --> 56:04.660
a little harder
if we really want to win.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.395
Okay. What do you have in mind?

56:08.165 --> 56:10.065
When people think
of New England,

56:10.101 --> 56:11.767
they think of lobster.

56:13.371 --> 56:14.737
And what better dish
to represent Delaney's

56:14.772 --> 56:16.972
than our father's
classic recipe for...

56:17.007 --> 56:18.273
Drum roll, please...

56:22.780 --> 56:23.912
Lobster rolls!

56:25.516 --> 56:26.749
Wow.

56:28.452 --> 56:29.618
Hey. Em.
Taste this.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.255
What do you think?

56:33.290 --> 56:34.256
It's awesome.

56:34.291 --> 56:35.357
Okay, then...

56:35.393 --> 56:37.259
scratch the brisket
and dial in the lobster rolls.

56:37.294 --> 56:38.927
It's a home run.

56:38.963 --> 56:40.429
Speaking of, Coach.

56:40.464 --> 56:41.597
Don't you two
have a game to win?

56:43.567 --> 56:44.733
Just putting on my game face.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.269
Let's go.

56:49.907 --> 56:51.140
Huh? Huh?

56:54.011 --> 56:55.277
[fans cheering]

56:58.816 --> 57:01.483
Tie score,
bases loaded, two outs,

57:01.519 --> 57:03.619
and Emily's up to bat--

57:04.989 --> 57:06.054
Oh, boy...

57:06.090 --> 57:07.456
All she has to do
is get on base

57:07.491 --> 57:09.324
and bring Sophia home...

57:09.360 --> 57:10.225
and we win the championship.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.059
Okay.

57:11.095 --> 57:12.027
Come on!

57:12.062 --> 57:13.128
You can do it, Emily!

57:18.836 --> 57:19.835
You just keep your eye
on the ball.

57:22.673 --> 57:25.140
You've got this, okay?

57:26.510 --> 57:27.643
I've got this.

57:34.919 --> 57:36.218
[umpire] Batter!

57:40.925 --> 57:42.124
Come on, Emily.
Bring me home!

57:46.697 --> 57:48.297
Oh, the pressure
she must be feeling.

58:01.545 --> 58:02.845
[umpire] Strike!

58:04.381 --> 58:05.214
Oh, that's alright,

will be on the menu
tomorrow at the festival?

Actually, no.

to taste it.

Principal Watkins,

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:19.134
I know I'm probably not
the obvious candidate

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:20.869
for the job opening
of head coach,

1:02:20.904 --> 1:02:24.339
but no one has the love
and deep respect for the game

1:02:24.374 --> 1:02:25.507
like I do.

1:02:25.542 --> 1:02:27.509
That may be so, Mr. Delaney,

1:02:27.544 --> 1:02:30.178
but the challenge for me,
as administrator,

1:02:30.214 --> 1:02:34.216
is, well, your lack
of formal teaching experience.

1:02:34.251 --> 1:02:36.485
Maybe in the classroom,
but not on the field.

1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:37.486
My years of coaching

1:02:37.521 --> 1:02:40.021
will prove to you
that I know how to motivate.

1:02:41.458 --> 1:02:43.024
This season,

1:02:43.060 --> 1:02:45.761
I led the Bright Shore Blue Jays
to win the championship.

1:02:54.538 --> 1:02:56.271

because I truly believe

1:02:58.242 --> 1:02:59.908
that this is what I'm meant
to do with my life.

1:03:01.812 --> 1:03:03.378
I was obsessed with winning,

1:03:03.413 --> 1:03:05.781
but coaching has shown me

1:03:05.816 --> 1:03:07.682
the value of something
far more important,

1:03:07.718 --> 1:03:10.852
and that is making a difference
in a child's life.

your candor and your passion,

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:19.761

1:03:47.057 --> 1:03:48.190
and in the end,
it's turned you around.

I needed for the longest time.

on the field yesterday

inside all of us.

holding out on us?

a lot lately.

You know,
I've got to say, Trevor,

1:04:49.853 --> 1:04:51.519
I never knew you had
such a passion for the business.

1:04:51.555 --> 1:04:53.788
Well, you never really gave me
a chance to show it.

1:04:55.225 --> 1:04:56.825
And that's my fault, okay?

1:04:56.860 --> 1:04:57.726
But moving forward,

1:04:57.761 --> 1:04:59.060

more responsibility

what's with this get-up?

I wasn't going to say anything,

1:05:11.575 --> 1:05:12.941
but I met with the Principal

1:05:12.976 --> 1:05:14.776
down at
Bright Shore High School

1:05:14.811 --> 1:05:16.378
and put my name in the hat
for the new head coach position.

1:05:17.948 --> 1:05:19.247
-No way!
-Way!

1:05:19.283 --> 1:05:20.782
I probably won't get it.

1:05:20.817 --> 1:05:21.917
[Trevor] It doesn't matter.

1:05:21.952 --> 1:05:24.185
At least you're finally
putting yourself out there.

1:05:24.221 --> 1:05:26.354
Yeah.

1:05:26.390 --> 1:05:28.256

taking more chances in life.

I'm really glad to hear it.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.059

1:05:31.094 --> 1:05:32.861
So why the sudden turnaround?

I guess watching someone
follow their dream

1:05:37.401 --> 1:05:38.400

1:05:38.435 --> 1:05:40.101
that it's never too late
to start pursuing my own.

1:05:41.939 --> 1:05:44.072

of whether you get it,

out on the patio

I couldn't resist one last
taste of the competition.

1:06:50.007 --> 1:06:51.373
Of course you couldn't.

[Caleb]
It really is delicious.

1:06:53.543 --> 1:06:54.609
I've got to be honest,

1:06:54.644 --> 1:06:56.644
I'm a little jealous
of your talent in the kitchen.

1:06:58.015 --> 1:07:01.116
Wow, a genuine compliment

1:07:01.151 --> 1:07:03.284
followed by another dose
of humility.

1:07:05.889 --> 1:07:06.988
Please, sit.

1:07:14.331 --> 1:07:16.564
Look...

1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:18.733
I know I've probably been
a bit of a handful

1:07:18.769 --> 1:07:21.536
for you to deal with
these past few weeks,

1:07:21.571 --> 1:07:26.074
but I just wanted you
to know that...

1:07:26.109 --> 1:07:31.513
watching you create all of this
from nothing,

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:34.215
it's really inspired me
to take a look at my own life.

1:07:35.619 --> 1:07:37.585
Caleb,

1:07:37.621 --> 1:07:39.521
I think that's the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:45.493
Since we're being honest,

1:07:45.529 --> 1:07:46.761
I don't think

1:07:46.797 --> 1:07:48.730
I would have signed the lease
to this restaurant so quickly

1:07:48.765 --> 1:07:50.198
if you hadn't rattled me.

1:07:51.902 --> 1:07:53.635
Yeah, I tend to have
a real knack for that.

1:07:57.741 --> 1:07:59.707
Well, we both have
a big day ahead of us.

1:07:59.743 --> 1:08:01.743
I want you to know that,

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:04.579
win or lose,

1:08:04.614 --> 1:08:05.814
I hope we can remain friends.

1:08:16.259 --> 1:08:17.258
Nice start.

1:08:17.294 --> 1:08:19.227
Let's fire up the fryers

1:08:19.262 --> 1:08:20.628
so we can get ready
for the empanadillas.

1:08:20.664 --> 1:08:21.896
On it, Chef.

1:08:23.266 --> 1:08:24.065
I wonder what Delaney's

1:08:24.101 --> 1:08:25.033
is planning to serve
from their menu.

1:08:28.004 --> 1:08:29.070
Maybe I should go over
and find out, huh?

1:08:30.574 --> 1:08:31.840
Say hello.

1:08:38.915 --> 1:08:40.248
Good morning.

1:08:40.283 --> 1:08:41.483
Hey. Sleep well?

1:08:41.518 --> 1:08:44.219
Not really,
with the long day ahead.

1:08:44.254 --> 1:08:45.286
Me too.

1:08:45.322 --> 1:08:46.387
I felt like I've been going
off pure adrenaline

1:08:46.423 --> 1:08:47.655
these past few days.

1:08:47.691 --> 1:08:48.723
Hey, Caleb, can you tell me

1:08:48.758 --> 1:08:49.891
if this lobster roll
can use a tad more paprika?

1:08:49.926 --> 1:08:50.959
[Caleb] Yeah.

1:08:50.994 --> 1:08:52.727
You're making lobster roll?

1:08:54.097 --> 1:08:55.797
Seriously?

1:08:55.832 --> 1:08:56.631
When you didn't tell me

1:08:56.666 --> 1:08:58.266
what you were planning
on serving,

1:08:58.301 --> 1:09:00.101
I certainly didn't expect
for you to copy my dish.

1:09:01.538 --> 1:09:02.837
Wait.

1:09:02.873 --> 1:09:03.771
No, Gabby.
It's not like that.

1:09:03.807 --> 1:09:04.939
Oh, really?

1:09:04.975 --> 1:09:05.874
Because I don't recall

1:09:05.909 --> 1:09:07.609
seeing lobster roll
on the menu before.

1:09:08.945 --> 1:09:10.645
Or maybe I inspired
this change in you, too.

1:09:12.449 --> 1:09:13.381
Just when I thought

1:09:13.416 --> 1:09:14.782
that we put the competition
between us aside

1:09:14.818 --> 1:09:16.117
to finally become friends.

1:09:17.954 --> 1:09:19.320
You really can't help yourself.

1:09:29.966 --> 1:09:31.199
Gabby.

1:09:31.234 --> 1:09:32.333
These are the festival judges.

1:09:32.369 --> 1:09:33.635
Oh.

1:09:36.239 --> 1:09:37.071
This is Barbara Gallagher

1:09:37.107 --> 1:09:38.540
with the Massachusetts
Food Journal.

1:09:38.575 --> 1:09:39.841
Pleasure to meet you.

1:09:39.876 --> 1:09:40.775
And Hank McMannon.

1:09:40.810 --> 1:09:41.843
Restaurant critic
with the Channel 16 News.

1:09:41.878 --> 1:09:42.944
Hi.

1:09:42.979 --> 1:09:44.145
And Peter Feldon.

1:09:44.181 --> 1:09:45.180
He writes a popular blog

1:09:45.215 --> 1:09:47.182
showcasing New England's
hidden restaurant gems.

1:09:47.217 --> 1:09:48.650
Well, I hope
my seafood empanadillas

1:09:48.685 --> 1:09:50.451
qualify for a spot in your blog.

1:09:50.487 --> 1:09:52.687
I hope so, too.

1:09:52.722 --> 1:09:54.355
Well, we'll let you get back
to prepping your dish for today.

1:09:54.391 --> 1:09:55.723
Nice meeting you.

1:09:55.759 --> 1:09:56.858
[Christina] Right this way.

1:10:09.906 --> 1:10:11.372
Ow!

1:10:11.408 --> 1:10:12.707
Sergio, be careful.
What happened?

1:10:14.044 --> 1:10:15.510
It's just hot oil, Chef.
I'll be fine.

1:10:15.545 --> 1:10:16.477
Oh, my goodness.

1:10:16.513 --> 1:10:17.845
You really burned your hand.
Give me a towel!

1:10:23.887 --> 1:10:24.953
You really have to get
this checked.

1:10:25.889 --> 1:10:27.355
There's a first-aid tent
near the entrance.

1:10:27.390 --> 1:10:28.256
Should I take him over?

1:10:28.291 --> 1:10:29.023
Yeah. Would you, please?

1:10:29.059 --> 1:10:30.058
But, Chef,
you'll be all alone.

1:10:30.093 --> 1:10:30.892
I'll handle it.

1:10:30.927 --> 1:10:32.060
Come on,
just make sure you're okay.

1:10:32.095 --> 1:10:32.994
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:10:41.037 --> 1:10:42.370
Oh, it looks like
Gabby just lost all her staff.

1:10:44.274 --> 1:10:45.707
She can't do all that prep
by herself.

1:10:47.143 --> 1:10:48.076
Well, we've got things
covered over here.

1:10:48.111 --> 1:10:49.043
Why don't you go help her?

1:10:49.079 --> 1:10:50.011
I'm pretty sure

1:10:50.046 --> 1:10:51.346
I'm the last person
she'll want help from.

1:10:51.381 --> 1:10:52.947
Maybe...

1:10:52.983 --> 1:10:54.415
but you'll never know
if you don't ask.

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:56.351
Take a shot.

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:11.933
Gabby, let me help.

1:11:11.968 --> 1:11:12.900
I'm fine.

1:11:12.936 --> 1:11:14.135
I can do this alone.

1:11:14.170 --> 1:11:15.637
I know you can.

1:11:15.672 --> 1:11:17.138
Please? I want to do this.

1:11:24.481 --> 1:11:25.380
Alright then...

1:11:27.183 --> 1:11:28.149
work the fryer.

1:11:28.184 --> 1:11:29.484
I'm going to start plating.

1:11:29.519 --> 1:11:30.952
-Okay. On it.
-Be careful, please.

1:11:30.987 --> 1:11:31.953
Yeah.

1:11:50.674 --> 1:11:55.143
[♪♪♪]

1:11:59.749 --> 1:12:00.948
Okay, and now we have

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:02.750
Grandma Susie's
Chili and Corn Bread.

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:12.260
Enjoy. Thank you.

1:12:14.764 --> 1:12:15.697
[Christina] Hey, girls.

1:12:15.732 --> 1:12:17.332
June's Gelato
is giving out free samples.

1:12:17.367 --> 1:12:18.333
I can see that.

1:12:18.368 --> 1:12:20.668
I think they're also
handing out free napkins.

1:12:22.906 --> 1:12:24.339
It's called "empanadilla."

1:12:25.709 --> 1:12:27.275
And this is Uncle John's Bistro
Chicken and Waffles.

1:12:33.283 --> 1:12:34.716
Hi. I really hope you enjoy it.

1:12:38.688 --> 1:12:39.654
You are tasting

1:12:39.689 --> 1:12:42.490
Delaney's freshly-made,
local lobster rolls.

1:12:45.028 --> 1:12:45.993
The acidity of the lemon

1:12:46.029 --> 1:12:48.763
really brings out the flavor
of the lobster.

1:12:48.798 --> 1:12:49.897
Nice job.

1:12:49.933 --> 1:12:51.232
Thanks, Hank.

1:13:02.379 --> 1:13:04.011
Hi. Is Sergio okay?

1:13:04.047 --> 1:13:05.713
They think it might be
a second-degree burn

1:13:05.749 --> 1:13:07.115
so they're taking him
to the emergency room.

1:13:07.150 --> 1:13:08.383
Okay.

1:13:08.418 --> 1:13:09.584
I just put another batch
into the fryer.

1:13:09.619 --> 1:13:11.018
What else can I do?

1:13:11.054 --> 1:13:14.088
I think we have everything
back under control.

1:13:14.124 --> 1:13:15.356
I'll leave you to it then.

1:13:15.392 --> 1:13:16.691
Okay.

1:13:16.726 --> 1:13:18.393
Caleb.

1:13:18.428 --> 1:13:19.660
Thanks.

1:13:21.598 --> 1:13:22.597
Yeah.

1:13:27.337 --> 1:13:31.539
Caleb Delaney just crossed
enemy lines to help out?

1:13:31.574 --> 1:13:33.174
He really must like you.

1:13:43.119 --> 1:13:44.752
Today, Gabby's serving
a seafood empanadilla.

1:13:44.788 --> 1:13:46.421
It is a fried delicacy

1:13:46.456 --> 1:13:48.723
consisting of shrimp,
lobster and scallops.

1:13:48.758 --> 1:13:50.625
It is a dish
native of Puerto Rico,

1:13:50.660 --> 1:13:51.759
where I was born.

1:13:55.665 --> 1:13:56.864
[Christina]
Any questions for Gabby?

1:14:08.211 --> 1:14:09.644
Sorry. Hey.

1:14:13.850 --> 1:14:18.152
[♪♪♪]

1:14:23.326 --> 1:14:24.759
-There you go.
-Enjoy.

1:14:27.163 --> 1:14:28.729
-Hi.
-Hey.

1:14:31.067 --> 1:14:32.467
Look...

1:14:32.502 --> 1:14:33.968
I should have told you
about the lobster rolls.

1:14:34.003 --> 1:14:35.002
It's just--

1:14:35.038 --> 1:14:37.004
ever since Trevor
has taken over in the kitchen,

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:40.475
the restaurant
has really come alive,

1:14:40.510 --> 1:14:42.376
and the lobster rolls...

1:14:42.412 --> 1:14:43.611
it's our dad's old recipe.

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:48.616
So I'm sorry.

1:14:48.651 --> 1:14:49.584
And again,
I should have told you,

1:14:49.619 --> 1:14:51.586
but I meant everything I said
last night.

1:14:54.090 --> 1:14:55.156
I'm starting to believe you.

1:14:57.193 --> 1:14:58.159
Good.

1:14:59.429 --> 1:15:02.196
So... how do you feel?

1:15:02.232 --> 1:15:04.232
To be honest, I'm wiped.

1:15:04.267 --> 1:15:05.533
It's been a long day.

1:15:05.568 --> 1:15:07.168
I'm just--
I'm glad it's over.

1:15:08.338 --> 1:15:09.337
Not quite.

1:15:09.372 --> 1:15:10.738
I think there's someone

1:15:10.773 --> 1:15:11.973
that might want
to say hello to you.

1:15:17.547 --> 1:15:18.513
Chef Franco?

1:15:19.749 --> 1:15:20.648
What is he doing here?

1:15:25.355 --> 1:15:26.287
Caleb.

1:15:27.524 --> 1:15:28.523
-Hi.
-How are you?

1:15:28.558 --> 1:15:29.524
Good. Good to see you.

1:15:29.559 --> 1:15:30.491
-Hey.
-Hey, Caleb.

1:15:30.527 --> 1:15:31.659
Good to see you.

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:34.462
I would like to introduce you
to Superintendent Meyers.

1:15:35.765 --> 1:15:36.831
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.
-Good to meet you.

1:15:36.866 --> 1:15:38.866
I hear a lot of good things
about you, young man,

1:15:38.902 --> 1:15:41.235
which is why Margaret insisted
I come down to meet you myself

1:15:41.271 --> 1:15:42.303
before we make
the final decision...

1:15:43.439 --> 1:15:44.705
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

1:15:45.942 --> 1:15:47.275
[Gabby] Thank you so much
for coming up,

1:15:47.310 --> 1:15:48.543
but how did you know that I--

1:15:48.578 --> 1:15:49.377
Your friend, Caleb,

1:15:49.412 --> 1:15:50.578
sent me an e-mail,
inviting me up.

1:15:50.613 --> 1:15:51.546
He told me I needed to see

1:15:51.581 --> 1:15:54.215
how much my former protégée
has blossomed.

1:15:56.586 --> 1:15:57.485
You should know

1:15:57.520 --> 1:15:59.086
he spoke about you
in very glowing terms.

1:16:00.823 --> 1:16:01.789
He did?

1:16:01.824 --> 1:16:02.757
Mm-hmm.

1:16:02.792 --> 1:16:05.192
I guess seeing you
rediscover your passion

1:16:05.228 --> 1:16:06.327
ignited something
inside him as well.

1:16:10.934 --> 1:16:12.867
You have finally
come into your own...

1:16:14.070 --> 1:16:15.403
...and I couldn't be
more proud of you...

1:16:17.674 --> 1:16:18.773
...Chef.

1:16:21.911 --> 1:16:22.777
Thank you, Chef.

1:16:25.815 --> 1:16:27.648
[Christina] If everyone
would like to gather,

1:16:27.684 --> 1:16:29.083
we're about to announce
our winners.

1:16:36.593 --> 1:16:37.425
Let's check it out.

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:47.335
First, the committee

1:16:47.370 --> 1:16:49.570
would like to thank
the community

1:16:49.606 --> 1:16:51.572
for making this year's
Taste of Summer Festival

1:16:51.608 --> 1:16:52.907
the best one ever.

1:16:52.942 --> 1:16:54.575
[applause]

1:17:03.519 --> 1:17:05.119
Third place winner

1:17:05.154 --> 1:17:08.489
goes to Uncle John's Bistro
of Lewiston Falls

1:17:08.524 --> 1:17:09.890
for their Chicken & Waffles.

1:17:16.265 --> 1:17:20.067
Second place goes to
Grandma Susie of Bright Shore

1:17:20.103 --> 1:17:21.769
for her Chili and Corn Bread.

1:17:25.341 --> 1:17:26.674
I hope we pull this off.

1:17:26.709 --> 1:17:27.742
We did our best.

1:17:27.777 --> 1:17:29.610
In the end, that's all anyone
can ever hope for.

1:17:34.350 --> 1:17:35.883
And now...

1:17:35.918 --> 1:17:38.352
For the winner of this year's
Taste of Summer Festival...

1:17:43.026 --> 1:17:44.992
Whatever happens, good luck.

1:17:47.063 --> 1:17:48.029
Good luck.

1:17:56.906 --> 1:17:58.506
The first-place prize
goes to...

1:18:02.145 --> 1:18:04.812
...Grace Restaurant
for her seafood empanadillas!

1:18:10.653 --> 1:18:11.952
You won!

1:18:11.988 --> 1:18:13.354
Go on, get up there.

1:18:13.389 --> 1:18:14.255
Go grab your ribbon.

1:18:23.966 --> 1:18:24.899
Thank you.

1:18:31.641 --> 1:18:32.907
Okay, I just want to say
a few words.

1:18:35.578 --> 1:18:36.977
I can't believe

1:18:37.013 --> 1:18:38.946
that it was just
a few weeks ago

1:18:38.981 --> 1:18:40.214
that I...

1:18:40.249 --> 1:18:41.816
that I came here

1:18:41.851 --> 1:18:43.284
with only a dream

1:18:43.319 --> 1:18:44.985
and the sheer determination
to make it happen.

1:18:45.021 --> 1:18:46.120
And...

1:18:46.155 --> 1:18:49.623
any of you who are dreamers...

1:18:49.659 --> 1:18:52.393
you know that
you're only as strong

1:18:52.428 --> 1:18:53.861
as the people
you surround yourself with.

1:18:55.031 --> 1:18:56.497
So thank you all--

1:18:56.532 --> 1:18:57.665
thank you, sister--

1:18:57.700 --> 1:18:58.999
for encouraging me

1:18:59.035 --> 1:19:00.768
to believe
that anything is possible

1:19:00.803 --> 1:19:01.902
if you set your mind to it.

1:19:07.677 --> 1:19:10.611
So for those of you
who believe in a dream,

1:19:10.646 --> 1:19:11.746
and you work hard at it...

1:19:12.949 --> 1:19:13.981
you're all winners.

1:19:15.384 --> 1:19:19.320
Here is to next year's festival!

1:19:29.732 --> 1:19:31.832
That's not exactly the face
of a man that just lost.

1:19:31.868 --> 1:19:33.734
Whoever said
that winning was everything?

1:19:40.710 --> 1:19:42.276
-May I see?
-Yes!

1:19:42.311 --> 1:19:43.778
[Caleb] You must feel
pretty good right now.

1:19:47.250 --> 1:19:49.150
Congratulations.

1:19:49.185 --> 1:19:50.184
I really am happy for you.

1:19:51.988 --> 1:19:53.988
You know,
my sister was right about you.

1:19:54.023 --> 1:19:57.458
She said that you're
a little rough around the edges,

1:19:57.493 --> 1:19:59.360
but deep down,
you've got a good heart.

1:20:00.730 --> 1:20:01.796
-She really said that?
-Mm-hmm.

1:20:04.433 --> 1:20:05.966
Thank you for inviting Franco.

1:20:06.002 --> 1:20:07.968
That was
incredibly sweet of you,

1:20:08.004 --> 1:20:09.837
and it meant a lot to me.

1:20:11.274 --> 1:20:12.540
I owed you one...

1:20:12.575 --> 1:20:13.607
or more.

1:20:15.211 --> 1:20:16.577
And because of you,

1:20:16.612 --> 1:20:18.646
I went down
to my old high school

1:20:18.681 --> 1:20:20.681
and I applied
for the new head coach position.

1:20:21.784 --> 1:20:22.750
Because of me?

1:20:22.785 --> 1:20:24.718
We regret the chances
we never take, right?

1:20:26.055 --> 1:20:27.721
Well, you are now looking at

1:20:27.757 --> 1:20:29.557
Bright Shore High School's
new coach.

1:20:29.592 --> 1:20:32.593
Caleb, that is amazing.

1:20:32.628 --> 1:20:34.061
I couldn't be
more thrilled for you.

1:20:34.096 --> 1:20:36.764
I don't know what it is
you've done to me, Gabby,

1:20:36.799 --> 1:20:39.033
but I just can't seem to get you
out of my mind.

1:20:41.604 --> 1:20:45.840
Now, there's just
one more chance

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:47.208
I can't wait to take...

1:20:53.916 --> 1:21:00.020
