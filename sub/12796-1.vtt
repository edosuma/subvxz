01:13.760 --> 01:16.286
Esteemed citizens of Quartu,

01:16.840 --> 01:19.844
I stand before you
a proud Blarg,

01:19.960 --> 01:23.851
for tonight, we will twist
the very fabric of reality.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.686
We will defy nature
with reckless abandon.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.364
We have also broken 16 galactic
statutes and one star ordinance,

01:32.680 --> 01:35.001
so I shouldn't see
anything about this online!

01:35.440 --> 01:36.487
Beautifully worded, sir.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.001
Hmm.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.283
In just a few moments,

01:40.360 --> 01:44.604
we will unleash a weapon so
powerful that it will take...

01:44.680 --> 01:49.049
Stanley, are you seriously still
texting after what I just said?

01:54.280 --> 01:56.442
Victor? If you please.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.888
Uh...

02:03.200 --> 02:04.201
Mommy.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.129
<i>Dialing</i> Mother.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.127
<i>Hello, Horkelberg residence!</i>

02:10.199 --> 02:12.646
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

02:12.720 --> 02:16.725
<i>Herman, it's that man again.
I hear heavy breathing</i> and...

02:17.440 --> 02:18.487
<i>Ew! And chewing!</i>

02:18.560 --> 02:19.880
<i>That's it.
I'm calling the police.</i>

02:21.240 --> 02:24.244
Does anyone else
feel like texting? Hmm?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.526
Show of hands?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.809
Anyone?
Uh-uh.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.646
Very well.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.041
Commence deplanetization!

02:32.680 --> 02:34.967
Ready the Deplanetizer!

02:35.720 --> 02:36.881
Seriously?

03:15.720 --> 03:20.521
<i>496, 497, 498, 499, 500.</i>

03:20.600 --> 03:22.523
<i>Come on.
Is that all you got?</i>

03:22.600 --> 03:25.968
<i>I need you to
give me 2,000,010%.</i>

03:26.080 --> 03:28.560
<i>One and two and three and four.</i>

03:28.640 --> 03:31.291
<i>Remember, if you feel
the burn, that's good.</i>

03:31.360 --> 03:33.488
<i>If you smell the burn,
that's bad.</i>

03:33.960 --> 03:35.962
Three, two, one.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.881
<i>Okay, let's dig deep.</i>

03:38.960 --> 03:40.325
<i>Don't quit on me now.</i>

03:40.400 --> 03:41.731
<i>Can you feel it?
Huh? Huh?</i>

03:41.800 --> 03:43.723
<i>Can you feel the burn?</i>

03:44.480 --> 03:46.801
Are you kidding?
I'm on fire.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.007
I can take anything you can
dish out, so bring it on!

03:51.080 --> 03:52.809
<i>Okay, 2,000 more.</i>

03:53.320 --> 03:55.084
2,000?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.925
<i>One and two, three and four.</i>

03:58.000 --> 04:00.128
<i>No pain, no gain.</i>

04:01.480 --> 04:04.165
<i>And we'll be right back
after these messages!</i>

04:04.280 --> 04:06.089
<i>Okay, bots! Let's do this!</i>

04:06.160 --> 04:08.242
<i>And lunge! And lunge!</i>

04:08.320 --> 04:11.085
<i>Ranger Workout
will be right back!</i>

04:11.160 --> 04:12.400
<i>Burn!</i>

04:14.320 --> 04:16.926
<i>Planet Tenemule is no more.</i>

04:17.160 --> 04:18.241
What?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.202
<i>Hello.
Dallas Wannamaker here.</i>

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
<i>Tonight at 5:00,</i>

04:21.360 --> 04:26.287
<i>another uninhabited planet is
destroyed without warning or cause,</i>

04:26.360 --> 04:30.604
<i>marking the fourth in recent memory
of our once-peaceful galaxy.</i>

04:30.680 --> 04:33.251
<i>As a result,
the President has requested</i>

04:33.320 --> 04:37.484
<i>our ever-vigilant Galactic
Rangers increase their numbers</i>

04:37.560 --> 04:39.688
<i>from four to five.</i>

04:40.200 --> 04:42.680
<i>Really? Just five?
All right.</i>

04:43.160 --> 04:46.721
<i>And now a message from the
man himself, Captain Qwark.</i>

04:48.160 --> 04:52.643
Space, a wondrous realm
full of adventure, and peril,

04:52.720 --> 04:56.008
and, uh, big-ness.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.406
Captain Qwark!

04:57.520 --> 05:00.569
The Solana Galaxy is our home,
and as many of you know,

05:00.920 --> 05:02.809
it's in a state of crisis.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.564
The Galactic Rangers
are looking for

05:04.640 --> 05:06.404
a new recruit to help
with the investigation.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.563
So if you're a small-time
nobody in search of adventure,

05:09.640 --> 05:13.725
come on down to the spaceport
and see me, Captain Qwark!

05:14.720 --> 05:16.165
Cue montage!
Cue montage!

05:25.560 --> 05:29.167
<i>Our next stop, Planet
Veldin's Kyzil Plateau!</i>

05:29.920 --> 05:31.126
Kyzil Plateau?

05:31.200 --> 05:32.326
<i>That's right!</i>

05:32.760 --> 05:34.410
<i>The Kyzil Plateau!</i>

05:35.400 --> 05:37.164
Ranger tryouts.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.890
This is huge.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.001
Galactic Ranger!
Grab some sky.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.447
Galactic Ranger, punk.
Put 'em...

05:44.600 --> 05:45.601
Whoa!

05:45.920 --> 05:47.285
Ranger down!

05:47.840 --> 05:49.604
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

05:50.280 --> 05:51.691
Hello?

05:52.440 --> 05:54.522
I'm here to pick up my ship?

05:54.840 --> 05:57.081
I'll be there in one minute.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.521
Ah!

05:58.600 --> 05:59.965
Give or take.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.281
Hello? Hello?

06:05.600 --> 06:06.965
Hello?

06:07.800 --> 06:08.801
Hmm?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.971
Are you ready to
have your mind blown?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.730
Eh. No.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.241
Whoo-ho-ho! Yeah!

06:17.880 --> 06:19.803
I'll take that as a yes.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.409
Boom!

06:23.480 --> 06:27.326
Protolux afterburners,
full Gadgetron weapon package,

06:27.400 --> 06:29.562
and a high-intensity
mag-booster so powerful,

06:29.640 --> 06:32.405
it can pick up a paperclip
from two kilocubits away.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.403
I think there's been a mistake.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.086
I came in to get
my ejector seat repaired.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.242
Why repair something
when you can improve it?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.288
Come on, have a seat.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.723
Now, let's fire up
that mag-booster!

06:49.840 --> 06:51.968
Oh!
Pretty sweet, right?

06:52.040 --> 06:54.646
I guess, but why do I need it?

06:54.720 --> 06:55.926
Well, you could...

06:56.000 --> 06:57.843
I mean, you know, if you ever...

06:58.160 --> 06:59.161
You know, I don't know.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.241
Whoa!

07:00.320 --> 07:01.685
No worries, I can buff that out.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.529
Maybe we should just...

07:03.600 --> 07:05.329
Power this sucker down.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.322
Oh, boy.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.402
Look out! Hello! Watch it!

07:10.480 --> 07:11.656
Hey, I've been looking for that.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.681
<i>Greetings, Cadet!</i>

07:14.040 --> 07:16.088
What was that sound?
Nothing.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.323
Uh... Unrelated question,
is your seatbelt on?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.370
Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!

07:37.240 --> 07:38.287
Those aren't the brakes!

07:39.680 --> 07:41.603
I'm too old to die!

07:41.680 --> 07:43.125
You've got to be kidding me.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.725
How did you get a license?

07:45.280 --> 07:46.805
Whoa!

07:46.880 --> 07:48.564
Can you hit
the kill switch, please?

07:48.680 --> 07:49.681
The fish witch?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.000
The kill switch!

07:51.480 --> 07:53.244
Eh...
On the dash!

07:54.520 --> 07:56.807
The drill hatch on the dish!

08:00.400 --> 08:02.084
Hang on, I can fix this.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.483
Your tail's in my face!

08:05.560 --> 08:07.483
Hey, the view's no prettier
down here, pal!

08:14.240 --> 08:16.846
There's a wall!

08:16.920 --> 08:17.967
Oh, boy.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.081
Yes!

08:20.280 --> 08:21.281
Whoa!

08:38.679 --> 08:39.681
Phew!

08:39.760 --> 08:41.602
That was a close one, huh?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.923
I want a refund!

08:46.600 --> 08:49.604
Yeah, that is going to
show up on my midyear review.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.283
You seem especially
brooding today, Victor.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.608
Come! I have just the thing
to brighten your day!

09:02.280 --> 09:04.282
Our next target!

09:05.040 --> 09:08.203
Look at these waterfalls,
the fjords,

09:08.280 --> 09:12.126
the rolling hills
of Corvoxian snodgrass!

09:12.960 --> 09:15.566
This is exactly what I need.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.921
But, sir, that entire region is heavily
patrolled by the Galactic Rangers!

09:24.240 --> 09:26.811
We will have this planet!

09:26.920 --> 09:31.608
And we will take it
by going on the offensive.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.325
Our forces will strike
at the Galactic Rangers first

09:36.440 --> 09:40.604
and remove them
from the equation altogether.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.160
Wait. Real battle?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.762
Metal hand against hand.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.524
I trust this pleases you?

09:47.640 --> 09:51.690
Of course it pleases me, but
we don't have any forces!

09:51.760 --> 09:53.842
You let me worry about that.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.681
In two days' time, the Galactic
Rangers will be destroyed

09:57.760 --> 10:01.207
and I'll be able to
complete my masterpiece!

10:01.840 --> 10:04.605
How many times, Ratchet?
How many?

10:04.680 --> 10:06.205
Come on, he's fine!

10:06.280 --> 10:07.964
He landed in a pile of ivy.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.041
Poison ivy.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.764
Look, you're a great mechanic,

10:10.880 --> 10:12.689
you got a lot of heart,
but you're careless.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.411
"Careless,"
it's such an ugly word.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.528
I prefer "carefree."

10:19.360 --> 10:21.362
Too soon?
Yeah, it was too soon.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.121
I know things
haven't been easy for you,

10:24.200 --> 10:27.044
but you can't keep acting out like
this when I have a shop to run.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.204
What's with you lately?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.121
I just feel like
I'm supposed to do more.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.202
I've always dreamt
of being a Galactic Ranger,

10:34.360 --> 10:36.328
doing big things,
like Captain Qwark!

10:37.080 --> 10:39.321
You want an old
mechanic's advice?

10:39.680 --> 10:43.162
Dream smaller. It leads
to less disappointment.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.331
Please, Grim.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.643
I just need one hour off so I can
go to the spaceport for tryouts.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.290
You promised you'd help me give

10:50.360 --> 10:52.806
proton scrubs to
every ship on the plateau!

10:53.200 --> 10:56.170
It's almost summer.
These people depend on us!

10:56.240 --> 10:59.449
First off, it's always summer.
We live in a desert.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.921
And second, that promise
is still in effect!

11:02.000 --> 11:06.403
It's a 100% valid promise, and
you can redeem it in one hour.

11:11.240 --> 11:15.211
Yes! You!
You are a great friend, Grim.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.004
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.051
I'll be back before you know it!

11:20.280 --> 11:21.850
You're the best boss
in the galaxy!

11:21.920 --> 11:24.764
An inspiration to us all!
Don't ever change!

11:24.880 --> 11:26.484
I'm okay!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.969
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

11:31.080 --> 11:34.209
<i>get on your feet,
put your hands together,</i>

11:34.280 --> 11:37.443
<i>and give a big
Planet Veldin welcome</i>

11:37.520 --> 11:41.286
<i>to your Galactic Rangers!</i>

11:43.120 --> 11:47.125
<i>First up, she'll shoot first and ask
questions when she's good and ready.</i>

11:47.760 --> 11:50.604
<i>Cora Veralux!</i>

11:53.720 --> 11:55.210
<i>You loved him in Grapplemania,</i>

11:55.280 --> 11:57.487
<i>you'll love him more
as a Galactic Ranger.</i>

11:57.960 --> 12:03.683
<i>Get ready to feel the pain
of Brax "The Brute" Lectrus!</i>

12:05.600 --> 12:07.204
Yeah, baby!

12:07.720 --> 12:09.245
<i>And finally,</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:14.242
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
the savior of Solana,</i>

12:14.640 --> 12:17.246
<i>Captain Qwark!</i>

12:18.960 --> 12:21.088
Hello, Veldin!

12:21.160 --> 12:22.650
Hello, Captain!

12:22.760 --> 12:24.171
He's on fire again.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.287
I know.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.567
My name is Copernicus Qwark,
and yes,

12:28.960 --> 12:32.089
that was an impressive wall
of fire I just walked past.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.447
I'm going to be real with
you folks for a moment.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.603
When President Phyronix recommended
I take on a new ranger,

12:40.680 --> 12:42.489
I knew just where to go.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.245
That's right, we want you!

12:46.520 --> 12:47.521
Yeah!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.682
The galaxy is a perilous place.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.811
Invasion,
space pirates, supernovas!

12:55.040 --> 12:58.203
I know what you're thinking,
"Do I have what it takes?"

12:58.520 --> 13:01.126
After all, you may not have
prevented Dr. Nefarious

13:01.200 --> 13:02.884
from atomizing Aleero City.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.961
You may not have
stopped Neftin Prog

13:06.040 --> 13:09.362
from rendering the entire
population of Aridia color-blind!

13:10.000 --> 13:11.161
Twice!

13:11.560 --> 13:15.963
After all, you may not have this
chiseled jaw or godlike pectoral region,

13:16.040 --> 13:20.170
but if you have heart,
then you have what it takes.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.969
You don't have what it takes.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.724
But I have heart.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.320
Yes, but unfortunately
that heart is encased

13:27.400 --> 13:30.165
in a weak, muscleless
mass of inexperience.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.561
Plus, there's your
history to consider.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.087
You got a long line
of citations here.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.925
Possession of an illegal
gravity repulsor...

13:38.040 --> 13:39.056
Oh, that was a misunderstanding.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.889
I thought that space pirate
was on the level!

13:41.040 --> 13:43.771
Operation of
a black-market accelerator.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.444
"Operation" is a strong word.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.249
It blew up as soon
as I turned it on!

13:47.480 --> 13:49.767
Willful disruption
of the space-time continuum?

13:49.880 --> 13:52.008
That is a funny story.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.607
You're reckless, you're a loose
cannon, and you're dangerous.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.888
That's my shtick.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.004
Wait! Just give me a chance!

14:00.080 --> 14:02.082
Sorry, no time!
Galaxy in jeopardy!

14:02.200 --> 14:06.091
Get back out there, and remember,
you can do anything...

14:06.600 --> 14:08.921
As long as you're me. Next!

14:11.680 --> 14:14.809
I have no less than
three lethal katas

14:14.880 --> 14:17.008
I would like to
demonstrate for you today.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.770
Get me out of these
tiny blue-neck towns.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.808
Dr. Nefarious!

14:26.920 --> 14:30.447
The mad scientist who made
all of this possible!

14:30.520 --> 14:33.126
"Mad" suggests
cognitive impairment.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.530
I'm more of
a vengeful scientist.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.805
I trust you're here
to meet the troops.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.800
Three hundred sentient warbots,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.890
built using the finest
raritanium in the galaxy,

14:49.960 --> 14:53.885
and programmed to assassinate
the Galactic Rangers.

14:53.960 --> 14:57.726
Proton-powered, rust-proof,
and laser-guided.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.723
Each of these perfect creations

14:59.800 --> 15:03.088
is an efficient,
remorseless killing machine.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.401
Remorseless killing machine...

15:05.480 --> 15:07.767
Makes me want to
have children of my own.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.481
But will they get the job done?

15:10.560 --> 15:13.689
I'd hate to have to send you
back where I found you.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.296
<i>State your prime objective.</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:18.005
Prime objective,
destroy Galactic Rangers.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.006
<i>Inspection complete.
Weapon issued.</i>

15:21.120 --> 15:24.920
My warbots know every offensive
tactic in the Ranger handbook.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.766
They won't just
kill the Rangers...

15:28.840 --> 15:30.046
Target acquired.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.244
They'll annihilate them!

15:40.040 --> 15:42.520
Nice. They killed
the lights, too.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.247
Burn.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.444
Repairbot!

15:56.920 --> 15:58.684
Ah!
Now we're talking.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.290
<i>Target acquired.</i>

16:22.400 --> 16:23.686
Oh, my...

16:24.360 --> 16:25.920
<i>State your prime objective.</i>

16:25.960 --> 16:27.564
Destroy Galactic Rangers.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.730
<i>State your prime objective.</i>

16:29.840 --> 16:31.524
Destroy Galactic Rangers.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.211
<i>State your prime...</i>

16:36.760 --> 16:37.761
<i>Hmm.</i> ..

16:38.600 --> 16:39.601
Hello.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.849
<i>Defect detected.</i>

16:42.920 --> 16:46.481
<i>Preparing for immediate
destruction in three, two...</i>

16:46.560 --> 16:47.561
<i>Hey! Wait!</i>

16:48.080 --> 16:49.366
Oh, a defect!

16:49.440 --> 16:51.408
Go play, Victor.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.001
No...

16:55.800 --> 16:57.325
Ahhh!

16:57.600 --> 16:59.602
I'm coming for you, defect!

17:01.120 --> 17:02.565
Oh! Ooh!

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
Hmm.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.240
Defect!

17:27.280 --> 17:31.604
Computer, set coordinates for
the Galactic Ranger home base.

17:31.680 --> 17:32.920
<i>Destination set.</i>

17:33.000 --> 17:35.651
<i>We will never make it, but,
hey, what are you gonna do?</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:37.806
Oh, dear.

17:45.480 --> 17:47.369
<i>Sayonara, amigo.</i>

17:48.000 --> 17:49.161
Ratchet...

17:54.160 --> 17:57.687
So, you're off to
save the galaxy.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.648
Turns out you were right.
I should dream smaller.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.048
I'll never be a Ranger.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.761
What?

18:46.920 --> 18:47.921
Whoa!

19:08.240 --> 19:10.402
<i>Danger detected.
Danger detected.</i>

19:10.520 --> 19:12.170
<i>I told you we'd never make it,</i>

19:12.240 --> 19:14.402
<i>but did you listen to me?
No.</i>

19:14.520 --> 19:15.726
Hello?

19:15.880 --> 19:17.405
Anyone in there? Whoa!

19:22.200 --> 19:23.416
<i>Prepare for imminent death.</i>

19:23.440 --> 19:25.727
There's got to be
a better way to say that.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.321
Sorry.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.080
<i>Prepare for
imminent death-How's that?</i>

19:30.920 --> 19:35.881
<i>Five, four, three, two, one...</i>

19:45.280 --> 19:48.682
No vector shell damage. Sister
board appears to be intact.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.806
Ah!

19:51.880 --> 19:53.530
I must get to Aleero City!

19:54.600 --> 19:55.601
They are in danger!

19:55.680 --> 19:57.967
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey, who's in danger?

19:58.040 --> 20:00.122
An army is coming.
I must warn them!

20:00.200 --> 20:03.010
Hang on, slow down.
You've been in a crash.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.848
What do you say we get
you back to my garage?

20:06.960 --> 20:09.691
I'll run a diagnostic and
have you fixed up in no time.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.001
Thank you.
I appreciate the assistance.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.327
It's no problem.
So what do I call you?

20:15.480 --> 20:19.804
I suppose my proper designation
is Warbot Defect B5429...

20:20.640 --> 20:23.120
Maybe I'll just call you Clank.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.726
My name's Ratchet.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.721
Uh...

20:29.960 --> 20:31.803
Up and down.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.161
Yeah, there you go.
You're a natural.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.089
Okay, that's enough.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.802
Or just keep shaking.
That's cool, too.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.290
Almost got it.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.283
And... There!

20:47.800 --> 20:48.847
How do you feel?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.487
Fully operational.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.647
Sweet.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.726
So, what are you doing all the
way out here in the sticks?

20:54.840 --> 20:57.207
I am on a mission of
galactic importance.

20:57.360 --> 20:58.850
"Galactic importance"?

20:59.240 --> 21:02.084
Okay. Oh, boy. You must
have ruptured your CPU.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.525
How many fingers
am I holding up?

21:03.840 --> 21:07.526
Uh... Two. But I fail to see
the relevance of the question.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.891
Chairman Drek has
built an army of warbots.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.203
They're going to assassinate
the Galactic Rangers tomorrow.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.008
Oh! That kind of
galactic importance!

21:17.080 --> 21:19.367
Well, why didn't you say so?
I can totally help!

21:19.960 --> 21:23.601
Oh, I could not ask a civilian to get
involved in something so dangerous.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.887
Well... No,
I'm not just a civilian.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.167
The Rangers are actually my

21:28.560 --> 21:29.607
friends!

21:30.200 --> 21:32.123
Why do you think I have
so many pictures of them?

21:33.360 --> 21:35.362
But why are you
not in any of them?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.841
Well, someone had to
take the picture, right?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.888
I mean, come on.
I even have a ship.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.129
It disassembles so it can
infiltrate enemy strongholds.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.241
So, what do you say?

21:53.200 --> 21:55.601
I understand
what the President wants,

21:55.720 --> 21:57.802
but what are the odds
of actually finding

21:57.920 --> 22:00.446
a qualified Ranger
way out in the boonies?

22:00.560 --> 22:03.928
After all, there's nothing the
three of us can't handle...

22:04.000 --> 22:05.047
Oh!

22:05.120 --> 22:07.771
I am your biggest fan.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.084
It's touching me.
Get it off. Get it off!

22:21.600 --> 22:24.729
Move it! Move it! We've
got hostiles! We've got hostiles!

22:24.800 --> 22:25.801
Go! Go! Go!

22:26.120 --> 22:28.441
Enemy warship!
Take cover, citizen!

22:28.760 --> 22:31.161
I love you!

22:43.400 --> 22:44.811
Target acquired.

22:51.960 --> 22:52.961
Hmm...

22:53.880 --> 22:54.881
Hmm.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.440
Hmm?

22:57.520 --> 22:59.204
What?
Apologies.

22:59.280 --> 23:02.807
I have not been able to locate
your species in my database.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.370
<i>I get that a lot.
There aren't many of us left.</i>

23:06.440 --> 23:08.010
<i>Not in this galaxy, anyway.</i>

23:09.640 --> 23:10.846
I'm a Lombax.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.485
A Lombax?

23:13.200 --> 23:14.281
Fascinating.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.569
Yeah. I crashed on Veldin
when I was just a baby.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.642
No note, no message,

23:19.720 --> 23:21.006
<i>No name...</i>

23:21.800 --> 23:23.370
Kinda like you.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.484
<i>Approaching destination.</i>

23:32.360 --> 23:33.771
Whoa!

23:33.840 --> 23:35.251
Aleero City!

23:35.320 --> 23:37.641
Yes, it certainly is.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.405
No way!

23:52.120 --> 23:54.691
It is the invasion.
We are too late.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.361
Target acquired.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.411
You knocked on
the wrong door, hombre.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.525
How was that?
Did that sound cool?

24:09.680 --> 24:10.886
Oh, boy.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.767
Target...

24:14.880 --> 24:16.405
Target acquired.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.406
Target...

24:21.200 --> 24:22.247
Target...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.723
Brax to the max!
Max!

24:27.560 --> 24:28.561
Awesome!

24:29.120 --> 24:30.281
Fire!

24:33.720 --> 24:35.006
Bring me the captain's head,

24:35.080 --> 24:37.242
or I'll take yours
as a replacement.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.846
Wilhelm!

24:44.960 --> 24:46.246
I got these guys.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.609
<i>Welcome to the Hall of Heroes...</i>

24:59.920 --> 25:02.287
Oops. I must've forgotten to
install the targeting software.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.925
Here, take the controls
for a sec.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.125
Oh. I... Um...

25:08.600 --> 25:10.682
Ow! Hey!
What's going on up there?

25:10.760 --> 25:13.081
Well, unfortunately
my piloting skills are,

25:13.160 --> 25:15.083
shall we say,
slightly underdeveloped.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.925
Yeah, I think we can
definitely agree on that.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.201
Whoa!
You maniac!

25:23.280 --> 25:25.362
Ratchet, we are clearly
not prepared for this.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.410
We should have contacted the Rangers
to warn them of the attack.

25:28.480 --> 25:31.051
Yeah,
like they'd know who we are.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.884
But you said
they were your friends.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.885
What?

25:34.960 --> 25:37.122
I think you're quoting me
out of context.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.089
<i>The Rangers are actually my</i>

25:40.160 --> 25:41.161
<i>friends!</i>

25:41.440 --> 25:43.408
Do you record everything I say?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.648
<i>Do you record everything I say?</i>

25:53.360 --> 25:55.283
We're going down!

25:55.520 --> 25:59.320
Your sense of direction
is impeccable.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.121
I can fix this!

26:12.840 --> 26:15.286
That was awesome!

26:15.960 --> 26:17.007
Finish them!

26:26.880 --> 26:29.611
Ratchet, I believe
I may have an idea.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.160
Your weapon package
includes a mag-booster.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.447
I am rewriting
the software to isolate

26:34.520 --> 26:37.046
the raritanium alloy
used to manufacture us.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.321
Great idea, Clank!

26:42.000 --> 26:43.126
Bring it on!

26:43.200 --> 26:44.201
There's too many of them!

26:44.280 --> 26:46.362
Hold steady, Rangers!

26:47.320 --> 26:50.085
Prepare to die, Galactic losers!

26:55.160 --> 26:56.366
Come on, come on!

26:57.560 --> 27:00.723
Executing command,
and engage mag-booster.

27:03.880 --> 27:04.881
Is it working?

27:05.240 --> 27:06.241
Oh!

27:06.720 --> 27:08.210
I do believe it is.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.730
Target acquired.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.201
Huh?

27:14.360 --> 27:15.361
No way.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.090
Yeah!
Oh, yes.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.805
You're getting this, right?

27:20.880 --> 27:23.645
<i>Two civilians
are saving the city!</i>

27:23.720 --> 27:26.485
There are 300 heavily armed
warbots gaining on us!

27:26.560 --> 27:28.164
I know! Isn't it great?

27:30.680 --> 27:32.364
Get ready to return to sender!

27:34.280 --> 27:36.044
Terminating mag-booster
on my mark!

27:36.120 --> 27:38.805
Three, two, one...

27:39.240 --> 27:40.366
Mark!

27:53.240 --> 27:55.208
No, no...

27:55.280 --> 27:56.884
No!

27:58.760 --> 27:59.761
What happened?

28:03.880 --> 28:06.451
You got to be kidding me!

28:09.720 --> 28:11.245
Get out.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.731
Taxi!

28:20.440 --> 28:22.124
Ah!

28:25.120 --> 28:26.121
Hmm?

28:37.080 --> 28:40.641
All right, everyone, let's give
these heroes some breathing room.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.963
I'm happy to field all
questions on their behalf.

28:44.320 --> 28:47.051
Captain Qwark! Juanita
Alvaro, Holo Vid <i>Nightly.</i>

28:47.160 --> 28:50.084
The Blarg have been underground
for over 50 years.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.640
Could their return be linked
to the destroyed planets?

28:52.720 --> 28:56.691
I think that's being a little
alarmist, don't you, Juanita?

28:56.760 --> 28:59.843
Begging your pardon, Captain,
but Drek is responsible.

28:59.960 --> 29:03.521
And his attack today proves that
he is only getting started.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.965
Now, now! We must all stay calm.
Everything is under control.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.804
Captain Qwark!
Dallas Wannamaker here.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.166
Does that mean you'll be asking

29:12.240 --> 29:13.924
these two heroes
to join the Rangers?

29:14.080 --> 29:15.650
Say what now?

29:17.640 --> 29:19.165
<i>Well, I...</i>

29:19.800 --> 29:21.564
I... Well, I...

29:25.360 --> 29:27.966
I don't see why not.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.730
<i>You heard it here, folks!</i>

29:34.840 --> 29:38.686
The search for a new
Galactic Ranger is over!

29:39.200 --> 29:42.170
Aleero City will never forget
the day it was saved by a...

29:42.240 --> 29:43.890
A cat thingy.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.568
How did this happen?

29:48.680 --> 29:51.809
Someone explain it to me!
You!

29:51.880 --> 29:54.281
You're supposed to
understand how they think!

29:54.360 --> 29:56.044
How did you not see this coming?

29:56.160 --> 29:57.844
And Victor!

29:59.320 --> 30:00.845
Do you know how many candidates

30:00.920 --> 30:02.445
you beat out for your position?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.648
I could have hired
the Zeezils Brothers!

30:04.720 --> 30:07.849
It's enough to make me
want to vaporize someone!

30:09.240 --> 30:11.527
We're putting
our project on hold.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.489
I'm ordering all
remaining warbots

30:13.560 --> 30:16.211
to the Deplanetizer
until the heat dies down.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.251
Before we make
any rash decisions,

30:20.320 --> 30:24.370
I wonder if you'd permit me
to troubleshoot this for you.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.847
Go on.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.570
Our question is simple.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.808
How do you destroy
a team of heroes?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.850
Whoa! Whoa!
Well, lots of ways, really.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.481
Chains, knives,
guns, an enormous rock?

30:39.760 --> 30:40.841
Rock...

30:40.920 --> 30:43.127
The answer is "from within!"

30:43.200 --> 30:46.886
If we continue to fight them with
muscle, we'll lose every time.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.567
But if we turn one of
their own against them...

30:50.880 --> 30:54.441
Of course,
we'd need a weak link.

30:54.520 --> 30:58.411
A sad simpleton who'd believe
whatever we tell him.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.847
A corruptible moron.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.685
But who?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.126
Who?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.286
Who?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.121
Hmm.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.201
Ah!

31:15.440 --> 31:18.728
I'm getting an idea, boys!

31:18.800 --> 31:20.484
You're a genius, sir.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.211
I know. I know!

31:25.160 --> 31:28.004
Our training program
usually lasts a full year,

31:28.080 --> 31:31.562
but we've been cleared to attack
Drek Industries in three days.

31:31.640 --> 31:35.122
That means you two are getting
the accelerated course.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.726
We're going to be
trained by Brax Lectrus?

31:37.800 --> 31:39.370
The guy's a legend!

31:39.440 --> 31:42.569
I do not suppose you offer
introductory courses in aviation?

31:42.640 --> 31:44.290
No offense, little guy...
"To the max!"

31:44.360 --> 31:46.283
but I don't think
flying's really your thing.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.364
Captain Qwark suggested we put you
in a position a little less...

31:49.760 --> 31:50.841
Dangerous?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.161
Whoa!

31:53.200 --> 31:55.806
Ha! That's right,
LivesAtHome472.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.451
What's the matter? Don't like
getting your butt kicked?

31:58.560 --> 32:01.325
What are you going to do,
cry to your mommy?

32:01.440 --> 32:03.602
Wait, are you really crying?

32:03.680 --> 32:04.681
Hey, Elaris.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.770
Hi, Brax!
Is that my new assistant?

32:07.840 --> 32:10.446
Greetings.
Your office is most, uh...

32:11.160 --> 32:13.481
Impressive.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.210
Elaris here is
in charge of developing

32:15.280 --> 32:17.487
our gear and providing
tactical support.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.686
Usually it's the former.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.331
The Rangers are the
shoot-first-think-later type.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.448
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to sound like that.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.201
Like what now?

32:25.720 --> 32:27.051
Come on.
I'll show you around.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.256
Let's go, Cadet.
Time to make you a Ranger.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.320
So, this is the...

32:29.880 --> 32:32.176
Got to keep an eye on them. Oh.
And over here, over here...

32:32.200 --> 32:33.281
I'll see you in a bit!

32:34.320 --> 32:36.049
We're going to have so much fun!

32:38.920 --> 32:40.285
Well, good luck.

32:45.560 --> 32:47.164
Welcome, Cadet!

32:53.240 --> 32:55.527
Let's get you into
your new protosuit.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.362
Your protosuit is the most advanced
combat armor on the market.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.250
And it comes in
all the latest fall colors!

33:02.320 --> 33:03.685
Sweet.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.001
A neural sensor in your
helmet reads your thoughts

33:06.080 --> 33:08.845
and telequips the desired
weapon into your hands.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.968
Try equipping your Combuster.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.376
There you go.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.243
<i>Combuster equipped.</i>

33:19.320 --> 33:20.560
Wicked.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.216
<i>The Combuster is the
backbone of the Rangers' arsenal,</i>

33:23.240 --> 33:26.050
<i>allowing you to hit targets
in a short to medium range.</i>

33:26.520 --> 33:28.204
Whoa!

33:29.440 --> 33:30.487
This is embarrassing.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.643
<i>The Alpha Disruptor
fires a deadly stream of plasma,</i>

33:33.720 --> 33:35.882
<i>allowing you to hit
multiple targets at once.</i>

33:36.680 --> 33:38.648
Whoa!
See? He's got it.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.001
Sort of.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.681
<i>This little baby's
the Negotiator.</i>

33:42.760 --> 33:45.650
<i>Fires multiple long-range,
high-impact rockets.</i>

33:45.960 --> 33:47.530
<i>Great versus heavy armor.</i>

33:51.640 --> 33:52.880
<i>Buzz Blades!</i>

33:52.960 --> 33:54.610
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no!

33:54.720 --> 33:55.721
Whoa!

33:55.800 --> 33:57.290
The Warmonger.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.281
Ah!

34:01.800 --> 34:04.121
<i>I dunno-
The Spiral of Death?</i>

34:08.639 --> 34:10.165
Whoa!

34:12.120 --> 34:13.320
<i>Fusion Grenade?</i>

34:17.360 --> 34:19.010
Wow.
Dude.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.491
How am I doing?

34:26.440 --> 34:28.522
So this is really your office?

34:28.639 --> 34:30.324
Eh. Budget cutbacks.

34:30.400 --> 34:33.290
I don't mind it <i>as</i> much as the
last guy who had this job.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.089
Dr. Nefarious.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.446
Drove him crazy.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.806
Literally. He turned evil.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.963
Oh. But don't worry. It won't
happen to me.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
Hmm.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.726
That's strange.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.926
What is it?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
I'm running a simulation

34:53.040 --> 34:55.771
based on the fragments we located
from each destroyed planet.

34:55.840 --> 34:58.366
Each one is missing
a famous landmass.

34:58.440 --> 35:01.046
Well, perhaps the pieces
are still out there.

35:01.160 --> 35:03.401
There is a lot
of space in space.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.641
I guess.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.246
But it's worth bringing up to
the captain, don't you think?

35:07.320 --> 35:09.016
- Out of the way!
- Hey!

35:09.040 --> 35:10.724
Watch out! Heads up!

35:11.200 --> 35:12.201
Coming through!

35:13.480 --> 35:14.481
Whoa!

35:17.320 --> 35:19.482
Just relax!
Everyone, stay calm!

35:19.560 --> 35:21.449
Something epic is happening!

35:22.760 --> 35:24.125
Pretty cool, huh, Clank?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.645
That's the stuff.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.643
Flying in the air
like a majestic bird,

35:28.040 --> 35:31.044
a majestic bird who knows
every fighting style.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.929
Watch the master.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.331
Captain, Elaris and I...

35:35.400 --> 35:36.970
Can't talk.
Have some information.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.644
Doing a flyby.

35:40.240 --> 35:44.006
Sir! If you could come down and
speak to us for three minutes...

35:45.240 --> 35:47.242
And there are the sprinklers.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.805
But, hey, good news!

35:48.880 --> 35:51.008
You already have a mop, huh?

35:51.160 --> 35:52.730
So, there's that.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.890
Please! If we could have just a
minute to discuss our findings.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.530
The only thing
I'm interested in finding

35:58.600 --> 36:00.728
is the Hall of Heroes cafeteria.

36:00.800 --> 36:05.044
Let's go, Cadet. It's three
floors up and it's meatloaf day!

36:05.480 --> 36:07.005
Meatloaf!

36:15.480 --> 36:17.767
Do they always
treat you so poorly?

36:17.880 --> 36:19.484
Oh! No!

36:20.080 --> 36:21.411
Yes.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.765
<i>The new Galactic
Ranger Ratchet action figure!</i>

36:25.840 --> 36:27.126
There he is!

36:27.200 --> 36:28.361
Guys, it's Ratchet!

36:28.720 --> 36:29.846
Hey-hey!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.684
Ratchet, we love you!

36:31.760 --> 36:35.446
Boy, for a big city, the
people here sure are friendly.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.727
And rather loud. Oh!

36:38.680 --> 36:41.001
Sorry!
Thought you were a trash can!

36:41.520 --> 36:42.760
Indeed.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.570
Wow. Look at that.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.042
What do you know, Clank?
I'm famous.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.841
Yes. Though I am sure it is exciting,
my cultural database shows

36:57.920 --> 37:00.685
that fame is highly overrated
and ultimately not rewarding.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.847
Would you agree?

37:02.040 --> 37:04.646
Oh, totally. Way overrated.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.047
Hey, do you think they'll
name a street after me?

37:07.480 --> 37:08.766
Or a cologne?

37:09.160 --> 37:12.323
"Ratchet.
Smell like a hero."

37:14.040 --> 37:16.168
There he is!

37:19.720 --> 37:20.801
Can I smell you?

37:21.040 --> 37:23.327
Easy, now. There's no rush.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.768
Believe me,
I could do this all day.

37:26.840 --> 37:27.841
Uh?

37:29.720 --> 37:32.087
Sorry, folks,
but, unfortunately,

37:32.160 --> 37:34.527
we don't have time
for this nonsense.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.080
I'm about to reveal
my awesome plan

37:37.160 --> 37:39.288
for the attack on
Drek Industries,

37:39.400 --> 37:42.882
unless, of course, anyone
would like my autograph.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.482
Good, because
we don't have time.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.000
You the man, Ratchet!

37:50.840 --> 37:52.604
I love you all!

37:53.520 --> 37:55.204
He's taller in person!

37:55.520 --> 37:56.521
Hmm.

37:57.600 --> 38:01.161
All right, Rangers,
our plan of attack is simple.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.163
HALO drop into Skorg City,

38:03.240 --> 38:05.447
fire a whole mess 0' bullets,

38:05.520 --> 38:09.366
and take Drek into custody so we
can be home in time for waffles.

38:09.520 --> 38:12.330
Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah! Yeah, waffles!

38:12.400 --> 38:13.606
Oh, that's good.

38:14.880 --> 38:17.008
Wait, that's our plan?

38:18.240 --> 38:19.730
Yes, it is.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.882
Pardon me, Captain,
but Chairman Drek is cunning.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.689
He will be prepared
for our assault.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.967
Look, I think
it is beyond adorable

38:26.040 --> 38:28.202
that you decided to
do all this homework.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.203
But big heroes do big things.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.167
Each second we waste
talking is a second

38:33.240 --> 38:35.163
Drek could use to
destroy another planet.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.403
But wouldn't it be worth taking
five minutes to review our plan?

38:38.480 --> 38:39.766
We have holoschematics...

38:39.920 --> 38:43.129
Does anyone else feel like
we should have shot something by now?

38:43.200 --> 38:45.736
Because it really feels like we
should have shot something by now.

38:45.760 --> 38:46.807
Thank you!

38:46.880 --> 38:47.880
Let's take a vote.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.082
All those in favor of
kicking in Drek's front door

38:50.160 --> 38:51.321
with a massive arsenal

38:51.400 --> 38:54.483
and restoring peace to a
galaxy in turmoil, say "Aye."

38:54.600 --> 38:55.806
Aye!

38:55.880 --> 38:57.689
All those in favor
of nerding it up here

38:57.760 --> 38:59.489
with some pie charts,
say "Nay."

38:59.560 --> 39:01.050
Nay.
Motion passes.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.202
We assault
Drek Industries tonight!

39:06.400 --> 39:07.970
Lock and load, Rangers!

39:08.040 --> 39:10.168
Suit up and rally
in the aft airlock.

39:12.120 --> 39:15.408
Although I am happy to help with
the mission in any capacity,

39:15.480 --> 39:19.565
I find this arrangement
slightly embarrassing.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.362
I'm sorry,
but you're the only one

39:22.440 --> 39:24.522
who's been inside
Drek's warbot factory.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.807
Besides, this is the best
way for you to keep up.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.527
Whoa!

39:28.600 --> 39:29.647
Nice backpack.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.764
Remember, your thrusters
are powered by Ratchet's suit,

39:32.840 --> 39:35.207
so don't try
any solo flights. Okay?

39:35.280 --> 39:36.566
I shall endeavor to...

39:36.640 --> 39:38.165
He's in good hands, Elaris.

39:38.240 --> 39:42.086
You sure you want to take
the, uh, extra baggage?

39:42.160 --> 39:44.606
No offense, but we're dropping
straight into a cauldron.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.160
And do you know
what's inside that cauldron?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.884
Is it danger?
It's...

39:49.520 --> 39:51.329
Yes, it's danger.

39:52.200 --> 39:53.611
Let's roll!

39:53.880 --> 39:56.645
All right, team.
Let's bring it in.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.007
Remember,
our target is Chairman Drek!

39:59.080 --> 40:00.161
Ready, Rangers?

40:00.720 --> 40:02.165
On the count of three.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.641
Three!

40:09.240 --> 40:10.571
Keep up, rookie!

40:11.000 --> 40:12.843
All right, pal, you ready?

40:12.920 --> 40:14.081
Well, I...

40:15.840 --> 40:16.841
Whoo-hoo!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.161
Yeah!

40:20.600 --> 40:21.840
Yeah!

40:25.080 --> 40:26.161
Yeah!

40:30.520 --> 40:31.521
Whoo!

40:32.360 --> 40:33.361
Ah!

40:48.040 --> 40:50.646
I'm in. Any sign of Drek?

40:52.520 --> 40:53.885
Negative.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.724
Place looks deserted.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.089
My internal coordinates system

40:59.160 --> 41:01.049
indicates a right turn up ahead.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.045
Eh. My gut says
this way, Clank.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.731
Glad you're getting in touch
with your feelings, newbie,

41:06.800 --> 41:08.040
but we're turning right.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.406
Because?

41:09.480 --> 41:13.041
Because I'm your senior Ranger
and I say so. That's why.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.724
Okay! Okay.

41:15.200 --> 41:16.645
Yeesh! Cranky.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.609
What's that?
Huh? Oh.

41:18.680 --> 41:22.401
I said, "thank ye" for
those words of wisdom.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.561
Good save.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.685
This feels too easy.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.009
Why was there no alarm?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.650
It is strange.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.370
Everyone, stay sharp.

41:34.160 --> 41:36.561
Initiate Phase One.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.081
Let's scatter the cockroaches.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.729
Just push the button, Zed!

41:52.600 --> 41:53.601
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

42:00.600 --> 42:02.125
<i>Zurkon, zurkon.</i>

42:03.560 --> 42:04.891
<i>Zurkon, zurkon.</i>

42:05.560 --> 42:07.130
<i>Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon...</i>

42:08.040 --> 42:09.530
Anyone hear that?

42:09.600 --> 42:11.090
<i>Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon.</i>

42:12.680 --> 42:14.444
Engaging motion scan.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.291
I'm getting something.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.561
Yeah.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.325
Me, too.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.724
<i>Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon.</i>

42:31.800 --> 42:33.723
Zurkon, zurkon, zurkon...

42:33.840 --> 42:34.841
Huh?

42:38.200 --> 42:39.201
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

42:40.280 --> 42:41.645
Zurkons!

42:41.720 --> 42:45.042
Mr. Zurkon
is looking to kill you!

42:45.280 --> 42:46.281
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

42:47.080 --> 42:48.411
Boom, baby!

42:51.160 --> 42:52.161
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

42:53.200 --> 42:54.201
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

42:54.280 --> 42:55.406
Yeah!

42:58.360 --> 43:00.567
Three-time
galactic champ up in here!

43:01.440 --> 43:04.330
Ranger identified.
Terminate!

43:05.320 --> 43:06.606
What's a Zurkon?

43:06.680 --> 43:09.763
Robotic bodyguards. They
protect whoever deploys them.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.366
Mr. Zurkon has you now.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.805
- Zurkon hates Galactic Rangers!
- Heads up!

43:17.640 --> 43:18.641
Whoa!

43:19.000 --> 43:20.843
Yoo-hoo!

43:21.560 --> 43:24.450
Nice shot. Do that again,
and I'll shoot you myself.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.484
What is this place?

43:30.720 --> 43:31.767
Huh.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.205
If I may...

43:36.400 --> 43:37.401
Hmm.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.643
Yoo-hoo!

43:42.720 --> 43:45.690
Stupid Ranger. Time to die!

43:46.640 --> 43:49.803
Mr. Zurkon delivers
a symphony of pain!

44:05.040 --> 44:07.407
Don't move.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.405
I'm listening.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.481
Captain Qwark.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.006
I've been watching you
these past few days,

44:16.080 --> 44:18.970
and I think
it's simply dreadful what...

44:19.040 --> 44:20.565
Sorry Zed!

44:20.720 --> 44:23.769
Simply dreadful what
Ratchet has done to you.

44:24.400 --> 44:27.688
He's made people
forget who the real hero is.

44:29.080 --> 44:32.527
All you wanted to do
was protect the galaxy,

44:32.600 --> 44:33.931
and how do they repay you?

44:34.320 --> 44:38.245
By dropping you for some... Well,
I don't even know what he is!

44:38.360 --> 44:42.126
Even if that were true, I could never
betray the citizens of Solana.

44:42.240 --> 44:46.609
My friend, betraying them is
how you get them to love you.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.325
Allow me to introduce you

44:51.400 --> 44:55.121
to my personal team
of Blargian PR professionals.

44:55.200 --> 44:57.680
Lads, tell him
how we work our magic!

44:58.160 --> 45:00.845
As far as I can see,
you're the victim here.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.002
That Lombax
pushed you to do this.

45:03.080 --> 45:04.081
He did?

45:04.360 --> 45:07.330
You were desperate, emotionally
scarred, depressed, even!

45:07.400 --> 45:08.890
You didn't know
what you were doing.

45:08.960 --> 45:11.361
The betrayal was a cry for help.

45:11.440 --> 45:13.363
It was?
It will be!

45:13.480 --> 45:16.006
A tell-all book,
a few guest appearances...

45:16.280 --> 45:17.281
A holo-film.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.804
No! A trilogy!

45:20.320 --> 45:24.405
In six months' time, you won't
just be Captain Qwark the hero...

45:24.480 --> 45:27.962
You'll be Captain Qwark
the survivor. Huh?

45:28.720 --> 45:31.166
No one needs to
get hurt, Captain.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.844
We can evacuate the planet

45:32.920 --> 45:37.084
and give these people a new place
to live, a better place to live.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.250
Do we have a deal?

45:40.480 --> 45:41.481
Huh?

45:45.840 --> 45:46.841
Hmm.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.891
Fascinating.

45:49.320 --> 45:53.325
These are plans for something
called a "Deplanetizer."

45:53.440 --> 45:54.851
Deplanetizer?

45:55.360 --> 45:57.931
Why would Drek
be destroying planets?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.764
Not destroy.

46:06.680 --> 46:10.730
It seems that Drek is trying
to build the perfect planet.

46:11.840 --> 46:13.729
Come on, let's move out!

46:13.800 --> 46:15.529
Hey! Wait for me!

46:16.040 --> 46:18.281
Wait! Wait!

46:18.360 --> 46:19.407
Sorry, Zed!

46:19.480 --> 46:22.165
I'll write you an excellent
letter of recommendation!

46:24.200 --> 46:26.202
You don't even have my email!

46:26.320 --> 46:29.767
It's Spacegangsta_72@Zed.com!

46:30.240 --> 46:31.685
Om

46:34.640 --> 46:35.641
Hi.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.643
Um...

46:37.720 --> 46:40.291
Before you start in
with the, um, questioning,

46:40.400 --> 46:44.166
it's important you understand that
I am faithful to my employer.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.687
And that's how I found out
I was lactose intolerant,

46:47.760 --> 46:49.536
though I think the parakeet
would've died anyway,

46:49.560 --> 46:51.376
because he was always flying
into the window, which is...

46:51.400 --> 46:53.448
She wouldn't drop him,
would she?

46:53.520 --> 46:54.521
Maybe.

46:55.240 --> 46:58.483
When I said, "Tell us everything."
I meant Drek's target list.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.005
Now, out with it!

47:00.240 --> 47:01.321
Probably.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.165
I would be more than happy to
supply you with the target list,

47:04.240 --> 47:08.643
but, unfortunately, I signed a legally
binding non-disclosure agreement.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.649
I want the rest of his targets.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.165
Now!
Please.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.890
This was supposed
to be a temp job

47:13.960 --> 47:15.530
until I got my
singing career on track.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.964
Okay, okay!

47:19.760 --> 47:21.125
Novalis.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.248
He wants Novalis.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.845
Novalis?

47:24.920 --> 47:26.684
Novalis is populated.

47:26.760 --> 47:31.926
Yes, 43,618,924 people,
to be exact.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.685
The Schnorkelsons
had twins this morning.

47:35.280 --> 47:36.566
We've got to move.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.684
Hey! Captain Qwark! Buddy!

47:53.440 --> 47:54.646
Remember me?

47:54.720 --> 47:57.166
From Drek's office? Where you
signed that contract and...

47:59.720 --> 48:00.721
Shh!

48:04.840 --> 48:06.046
Not the face!

48:16.440 --> 48:20.331
Dear Diary... I mean, journal.
Yes.

48:20.400 --> 48:24.803
Dear Journal, I've been
having the mood swings again.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.366
One minute,
I'm laughing hysterically.

48:27.440 --> 48:30.569
The next minute,
I'm laughing maniacally.

48:30.640 --> 48:35.248
I guess it's because everything is
going exactly according to plan.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.607
Soon, I'll be long gone,

48:37.680 --> 48:40.763
and the entire solar system
will be nothing

48:40.840 --> 48:43.844
but a giant cloud
of dust and gas.

48:43.960 --> 48:46.042
Excuse me, Doctor.

48:46.120 --> 48:47.849
Chairman Drek
would like to see you.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.604
How long have you
been standing there?

48:49.680 --> 48:52.524
I came in during the part
about dust and gas?

48:54.080 --> 48:57.289
It's my dietary journal.

48:57.360 --> 49:03.527
I keep a very strict record of everything
I eat and which foods give me...

49:03.800 --> 49:05.040
Dust and gas?

49:05.360 --> 49:06.885
Exactly.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.885
Cool.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.367
General Qwark
moves into position.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.201
Ooh.

49:20.360 --> 49:25.207
Cleverly, he deactivates the weapons
system, and the crowd goes wild.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.887
Yeah! Yeah!
Qwark is the best! Yeah!

49:34.560 --> 49:38.042
<i>Novalis Control, evac
shuttle convoy 262 departing orbit.</i>

49:38.160 --> 49:40.128
<i>Evacuation 82% complete.</i>

49:42.240 --> 49:45.687
<i>Fighters ready to rock.
So what's the plan, Captain?</i>

49:45.840 --> 49:47.569
<i>Uh?</i> Oh... The <i>plan?</i>

49:47.640 --> 49:50.644
Yes. Here's what
we're going to do, Rangers.

49:50.720 --> 49:54.247
I'll go in first and try to
reason with this Drek character,

49:54.320 --> 49:58.644
see if we can talk
this out, mano-a-mano.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.087
Talk? I don't follow, sir.

50:01.160 --> 50:04.607
Sir, he's blown up
five planets already!

50:04.680 --> 50:06.364
I think we're done talking.

50:06.480 --> 50:09.927
Captain, if we can just take 30
seconds, I think I have an idea.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.963
Sure. Go ahead.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.256
<i>Well, I was looking at the
schematics of the Deplanetizer...</i>

50:14.280 --> 50:15.725
Yeah.
And <i>it</i> occurred to me...

50:15.800 --> 50:17.131
And mute.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.376
I'm <i>going</i> in.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.290
<i>Captain, wait! Back-up is
on the way! We should...</i>

50:23.760 --> 50:25.569
Hostile ship on approach, sir.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.290
Should we fire proton cannons?

50:27.520 --> 50:28.851
Not yet.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.201
I've got a shiny
new puppet down there,

50:31.280 --> 50:33.487
and I'm about to put on a show.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.203
"Starting secret mission.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.408
"Hero work ain't easy.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.882
"♪Humblebrag, ♪Killinglt,

50:44.960 --> 50:49.045
"♪NoFilter, ♪No'tAMole."

50:49.560 --> 50:51.210
<i>Ah!</i>
I'm not a sellout!

50:51.280 --> 50:53.169
<i>Captain Qwark!</i>

50:53.480 --> 50:56.245
<i>You performed marvelously.</i>

50:56.320 --> 50:59.369
<i>Be honest,
are you a professional actor?</i>

50:59.920 --> 51:03.367
Well, I did dabble in my share
of theater back in grade school.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.851
Every year, I'd play the dad...

51:04.920 --> 51:08.766
<i>Yes, an enthralling saga
I'd love to hear!</i>

51:09.160 --> 51:12.004
<i>But first, you've disabled
the weapons system</i>

51:12.080 --> 51:14.003
<i>on the Rangers' fleet, right?</i>

51:14.280 --> 51:17.090
<i>Oh, just as a safety
precaution, mind you.</i>

51:17.160 --> 51:21.688
<i>We wouldn't want a tense situation
to escalate out of control.</i>

51:21.840 --> 51:24.207
Of course,
we wouldn't want that.

51:24.280 --> 51:27.489
And I have your word that my team
isn't going to get hurt, right?

51:27.840 --> 51:30.605
<i>Oh, my dear captain!</i>

51:30.680 --> 51:32.489
<i>Where's the trust?</i>

51:35.360 --> 51:37.681
Destroy them all.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.529
Contact! Contact!

51:48.640 --> 51:50.130
All units, engage.

51:52.360 --> 51:55.364
<i>Error. Error.
Weapons system compromised.</i>

51:55.480 --> 51:56.811
Cannons! Missiles!

51:56.880 --> 51:59.326
<i>Weapon systems are negative
across the board!</i>

51:59.640 --> 52:01.529
Same here! I got nothing!

52:01.600 --> 52:04.524
We've been sabotaged.
Rangers, fall back!

52:04.640 --> 52:06.324
Break off! Break off!

52:15.800 --> 52:17.723
The Rangers are retreating, sir.

52:17.800 --> 52:18.881
Brilliant.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.041
Hmm.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.048
Get me a holo-scan
of that ship.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.321
Right away, sir.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.041
Well, lookee-lookee.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.324
What have we here?

52:32.400 --> 52:33.561
The defect.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.329
Ah, yes, the one that got away.

52:37.400 --> 52:39.084
Not this time.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.929
Are you sure, Victor?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.367
He looks awfully dangerous.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.408
Teleport me to the ship.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.130
It's impossible, sir.
It's shielded.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.611
Just get me close!

52:54.320 --> 52:55.924
No, I can't leave him.

52:58.760 --> 53:00.285
<i>Ratchet, what are you doing?</i>

53:00.400 --> 53:01.606
I'm going in!

53:01.720 --> 53:03.245
Ratchet, don't do this.

53:03.320 --> 53:05.971
If you give us a minute, we
can work out an assault plan!

53:06.120 --> 53:07.281
There's no <i>time!</i>

53:07.400 --> 53:10.563
Captain Qwark is in there fighting
an entire army on his own!

53:12.760 --> 53:14.125
Permission to land?

53:14.720 --> 53:16.449
Permission granted.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.445
Mmm.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.768
Who's on foot duty?

53:25.840 --> 53:28.127
Tootsie rub, come on.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.041
Ah!

53:32.960 --> 53:34.962
Their defensive fire
is too strong.

53:35.040 --> 53:37.008
Pull back!
Your fighter won't make it.

53:37.440 --> 53:38.930
I don't have to land!

53:39.000 --> 53:40.809
I just have to get close.

53:47.600 --> 53:49.443
<i>Hull integrity at 2%.</i>

53:49.760 --> 53:51.091
<i>Prepare to teleject.</i>

53:51.160 --> 53:53.322
Ratchet,
please, listen to Elaris.

53:53.400 --> 53:58.486
The odds of surviving a head-on
assault is roughly 600,993 to one!

53:58.800 --> 54:00.768
Big heroes do big things.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.248
Three, two, one...

54:09.960 --> 54:11.849
He made it!

54:12.160 --> 54:13.161
What was that?

54:13.280 --> 54:15.647
I do not know.
I will investigate.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.244
Probably just the ship settling.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.530
Nothing to be alarmed about.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.001
Whoa!

54:28.920 --> 54:29.921
Ah!

54:30.000 --> 54:31.206
Defect!

54:31.840 --> 54:32.840
Oh, my-

54:32.880 --> 54:36.362
I am coming for you, Defect!

54:37.320 --> 54:39.641
Uh, I believe
we may have a problem.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.644
Coming through!

54:43.360 --> 54:44.930
<i>Star Cracker Chamber,</i>

54:45.000 --> 54:48.209
<i>47 meters southwest,
then slight right ahead.</i>

54:48.320 --> 54:49.845
<i>Ratchet?
Where are you?</i>

54:50.240 --> 54:52.481
Can't talk! I'm almost
at the control center.

54:52.600 --> 54:55.763
<i>Captain Qwark did something to the ship!
Nothing's working!</i>

54:56.400 --> 54:57.811
<i>And I think Clank's in trouble!</i>

54:57.880 --> 55:00.565
Roger that! As soon as I stop
the Deplanetizer from firing,

55:00.640 --> 55:01.801
I'll be right back to help.

55:04.560 --> 55:06.289
<i>Deplanetizer now online.</i>

55:13.440 --> 55:15.568
Bravo, my boy!

55:15.760 --> 55:18.001
Bravo!

55:18.080 --> 55:21.402
I deal with my share of
morons on a daily basis,

55:21.520 --> 55:23.841
but this?

55:23.920 --> 55:26.764
This is seriously next level!

55:29.360 --> 55:30.441
Take him.

55:34.640 --> 55:36.369
Where are you?

55:38.760 --> 55:40.250
Come out and fight!

55:41.200 --> 55:43.089
You want a fight?
I'll give you a fight.

55:43.640 --> 55:45.881
No free rides!

55:57.160 --> 55:58.161
Hmm.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.001
Die!

56:01.320 --> 56:02.481
Get back here!

56:02.560 --> 56:06.804
I'm going to make you wish
you were never created!

56:11.280 --> 56:12.964
<i>Thundersmack equipped.</i>

56:14.720 --> 56:18.042
You're
nothing but a pathetic defect!

56:18.120 --> 56:20.521
Perhaps.
But I am waterproof.

56:43.480 --> 56:46.404
Defect!

56:50.640 --> 56:52.881
Hey! Over here!

56:58.680 --> 57:00.330
Can I switch sides now?

57:01.680 --> 57:03.887
I never had a proper planet.

57:04.440 --> 57:07.091
I spent my formative years
underground,

57:07.160 --> 57:10.562
where everything
was dark and wet and hot.

57:10.680 --> 57:14.401
And I was like, "Warrior? No,
I said I was a worrier!"

57:14.520 --> 57:16.488
I worry about everything!

57:16.560 --> 57:18.369
I... on, hey.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.401
Qwark?

57:21.800 --> 57:23.802
This is awkward.

57:30.200 --> 57:35.081
The next time you and those moronic
Rangers decide to play hero...

57:38.400 --> 57:40.129
plan better.

57:40.480 --> 57:42.608
Toss him into
one of the shuttles.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.200
I want him to live
to see his failure.

57:45.320 --> 57:48.847
Drek, don't do this!
Novalis is home to millions!

57:48.920 --> 57:52.003
Yes, yes, and they had
their time in the sun.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.969
Now it's our turn.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.925
Commence deplanetization!

57:57.000 --> 57:58.525
Ready the Deplanetizer!

58:06.760 --> 58:07.761
No!

58:34.280 --> 58:37.443
Well, here's your I.D.
Welcome aboard.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.081
Captain?
Huh?

58:41.600 --> 58:44.331
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.004
Release the harvesters!

59:51.520 --> 59:53.602
<i>In the wake
of Novalis' destruction</i>

59:53.680 --> 59:55.648
<i>and Captain Qwark's
shocking betrayal,</i>

59:55.720 --> 59:57.802
<i>Galactic President Phyronix
has issued</i>

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.326
a <i>galaxy-wide alert
to all Solana citizens.</i>

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.004
<i>Residents are to
remain in their homes</i>

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.684
<i>while authorities
manage the crisis.</i>

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.445
<i>And though the planet
was successfully evacuated,</i>

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.525
<i>the question remains, did we put
our trust in the wrong Lombax?</i>

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.609
Uh...

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.886
Can I come in?

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.248
That protosuit of yours
keeps beeping.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.887
All day, all night, voices
asking you to come back.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.647
Those Ranger hotshots
are persistent.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.884
Yeah. Thanks, Grim. I'll
turn it off in the morning.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.886
Hey. I remember this.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.484
You wandered into the garage and took
my rocket sled for a test drive.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.562
No fear, no safety check,

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.845
you just flipped the switch,
and off you went.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.811
Took three police bots to chase you
down and teach you how to stop!

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.761
I guess I just wanted
to do something big.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.644
I wanted to matter, you know?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.485
I ain't never been
very good with advice.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.409
But I do know this.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.601
To be a hero, you don't
have to do big things,

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.171
just the right ones.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.489
That's actually not bad.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.560
Thank you.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.965
I have my moments.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.607
I'm okay.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.408
My dear, sweet Victor.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.930
You were a wonderful
friend and companion.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.844
Honest. Loyal. Rusty.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.496
I mean, really rusty.
I could hear you

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.806
all the way across the station.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.923
But still, we honor you with this
silent moment of reflection,

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.685
as thanks for your sacrifice.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.483
You will be missed.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.361
Let's get this show on the road!

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.001
Bring in New Quartu!

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.001
Bring in New Quartu!

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.169
Uh, how are things
at home, Jeff?

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.486
Great!

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.685
It's beautiful.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.363
I did it, Father. I did it!

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.522
It's beautiful.
Uh...

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.282
I thought I might find you here.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.486
Clank?

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.883
I'm not going back, Clank.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.401
This is where I belong.
You were right.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.648
Fame is overrated,

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.929
especially when you're famous for
causing a complete disaster.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.889
It was not a complete disaster.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.971
<i>Authorities are calling it a
"complete and utter disaster"..</i>

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.246
Sorry!

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.564
The evacuation
of Novalis was successful.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:32.762
No one was killed or injured.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.367
But those people
lost their homes,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.728
and for that, I have to
take full responsibility.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.965
Blaming yourself
and taking responsibility

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.565
are two very different things.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.003
If you truly
want to be accountable,

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.208
you will endeavor to make
things right the next time.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.041
Next time?

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.851
Drek has one more target
on his list.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.287
With Captain Qwark
now working for the enemy,

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.880
the Rangers need you
more than ever.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.244
And I would like to offer my
assistance in any way possible,

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.046
partner.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:09.928
Earthquake!

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.771
What's that?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.923
Oh, I brought some friends.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.811
Okay, pity party's over.
Time to get back to work.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.803
Listen, guys, I'm sorry I
ran out on you like that.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.442
Even though I messed up, I should've
stayed to fix it and see it through.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.242
Eh. We've all made bad choices.
Here, check it out.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.850
My cadet photo.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.609
Really?
That's how we're playing?

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.490
Okay, uh, there's no need
to embarrass anyone here.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.163
Okay, everyone, chill out!

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.602
We have a job to do,
and I need to

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.887
start shooting
at something immediately.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:07.564
Well, before we
just go off and start

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.642
shooting at things,
I was thinking that...

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:11.086
Yeah, get some.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.446
That's what I'm talking about.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.567
Forget it.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.762
No, wait. Go on.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.764
I think we need to hear
what you both have to say.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.850
Well, while we can't move a
planet out of the way...

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.689
I was thinking, what if we could

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.127
move the weapon
targeting that planet?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.363
Move the Deplanetizer?

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.084
Knock it off course.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.083
Okay. Awesome.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.811
And just how
are we going to do that?

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.247
Not sure yet.
But I'm working on it.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.041
Hmm.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.522
I might have an idea.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.256
So after you
pick up my dry cleaning,

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.976
you need to polish the
Segway, and after that...

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.650
Drek, I want to talk to you.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.491
You tried to kill my Rangers! You
said you'd leave them alone!

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.241
And I meant it at the time!

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:01.728
I detest bloodshed
as much as any Blarg,

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:07.131
but sometimes, sacrifices are
necessary for the greater good.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.646
I know you're working
with Nefarious on this.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.802
Yes, isn't it wonderful?

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.611
We're all part of
the same dream team.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:17.207
We should
make T-shirts!

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.362
You're making a big mistake.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:22.603
You have no idea the kinds
of evil he's capable of.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.603
Oh, but I do.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.365
It's all right here on his resume.
Special skills...

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.240
Horrendous evil. Unspeakable evil.
Diabolical evil.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.970
He's very well-rounded.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:36.163
And apparently,
he can juggle. Hmm.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.526
Oh-Oh!

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.446
Do I feel my ears burning?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.241
And there's our little
juggling psychopath now!

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.809
You died in a prison escape.
There were witnesses.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.921
Oh.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.522
People will say and do
just about anything

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.204
for the right price.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.402
What was yours, Qwark?

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.930
What was your price
for selling out your friends?

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.283
Your face on another
cereal box, perhaps?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.761
Why don't you run along

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.684
so the Chairman and I can get
back to the business at hand?

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.764
But what am I supposed to do?

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.400
You can guard the Star
Cracker water cooler.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.087
Oh! But with fury!
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.890
That was fun!

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.442
And T-shirts would be a good idea.
Good for morale.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.284
What do you think, Neffie?
Should we...

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.968
Sheepinator.
One of my personal favorites.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:37.603
It's time for
a change of management.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.482
Huh? Uh-Oh...

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.849
Okay, let's do this! We only got
so much time to get it all done.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.531
Use that, whatever that's called.
That's good. Okay.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.129
Right. Over here.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.443
Keep bringing it on in, ratcheting
it on up, electrifying everything.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.010
Make sure
everything's got electricity

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.536
running through it,
at least a little bit.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.450
That's good, too. Whatever
that is, you're doing great.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.681
Okay-

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.044
<i>Hey, everybody!
Get in here now!</i>

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.210
<i>Uh, please.</i>

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.764
You're not going
to believe this.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.605
We finally decoded
the Deplanetizer plans.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.002
We found his next target.
It's Umbris.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.725
Well, at least he picked
an empty planet this time.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.531
Yes, however,
it is a volatile planet.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:27.241
Its core is made up
of pure melluvium.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.522
Blowing it up will result
in a chain reaction

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.728
that will destroy
the entire system.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.685
But why would Drek do that?

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.841
I thought he was trying to
build the perfect planet?

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.129
Well, because Umbris
wasn't Drek's idea.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:40.401
Duh!

01:08:40.479 --> 01:08:41.606
What do you mean?

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.051
It's Nefarious.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.359
Dr. Nefarious?

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:47.563
No, Steve Nefarious.
Of course it's Dr. Nefarious!

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.444
Oh, yeah, funny how
you didn't mention that

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.336
when I was dangling you
over the edge of a building.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.249
Well, you didn't ask,
now did you?

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.044
Okay, that's it.
I'm shooting him.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.531
What? Don't shoot him.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.127
I am confused.
I thought Nefarious was dead.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.526
Only on the inside.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.761
Otherwise, he's very much...

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.763
<i>Alive!</i>

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.890
Okay, shoot him.

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.608
You wanted New Quartu?
Huh?

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.484
I'll give it to you.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.085
Happy trails!

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.926
<i>Now entering Umbris atmosphere.</i>

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:38.884
Yes, it's almost here.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.810
The beginning of the end.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.966
The end of what?

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.921
Let the games begin.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.401
<i>Remote detonation now
activated-</i>

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.449
<i>It is about to get real.</i>

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.881
We're as close as we can get
without being spotted.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.281
Okay,
so what's the plan, Elaris?

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.129
Go on. We're listening.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.609
Well, I've been hard at work
on a little something called

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.284
the Hologuise.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:20.968
<i>It'll project a visual and audible
replication of Captain Qwark so realistic,</i>

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.844
<i>it would fool his own mother.</i>

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.169
<i>With Ratchet posing as Qwark,</i>

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.651
<i>they'll dock with
the Deplanetizer</i>

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.802
<i>by easily fooling
the simpleminded Blarg.</i>

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.483
Yes, Captain.
What can I do you for?

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.564
<i>Greetings, citizen.
Just returning from patrol.</i>

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.007
Copy that.
Deactivating shield grid 24 A.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.284
<i>Once inside, Ratchet
and Clank will make their way</i>

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.931
<i>through the Star Cracker
chamber to the inner core.</i>

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.164
<i>When Ratchet
exposes the stabilizer,</i>

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.004
<i>it can quickly
be disconnected...</i>

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.321
Yes. Got it.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.565
<i>Meanwhile, Clank will
disable all the other weapons</i>

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.971
<i>by hacking into the mainframe.</i>

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.084
Weapons system disabled.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.685
<i>Leaving the Deplanetizer</i>

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.525
<i>completely vulnerable
to any outside forces.</i>

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.011
<i>Warning. Warning.
Core stabilizer offline.</i>

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.367
Run away! Everybody panic!

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.642
Warning. Warning.
What's happening?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.685
<i>Warning.
Core stabilizer offline.</i>

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.962
Dr. Nefarious, sir...
I mean, Doctor!

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.201
Where are you going?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.609
Me? Nowhere. Certainly not out
of a system-wide blast radius.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.165
What?
What?

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.401
We've been infiltrated.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.126
The Galactic Rangers are trying
to shut down the Deplanetizer,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.282
and I can't find
Chairman Drek anywhere!

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.407
Ah!

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.205
You want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.564
Warning. Warning.
Huh?

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.887
<i>Core stabilizer offline.</i>

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.206
Everybody panic!

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.566
Ratchet...

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:54.847
And we're clear.
All units, move in.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:56.684
<i>Yeah!
Way to go, you guys!</i>

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.889
Ratchet!

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.810
Greetings, Cadet.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.846
Captain Qwark, on behalf
of the Galactic Rangers,

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.922
I'm placing you under arrest.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.290
You can't do that. I'll
just arrest you fightback!

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.971
On what charge?

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.850
False arrest?
Being annoying? Who cares?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.487
You stabbed your own team
in the back, Qwark!

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.251
Just like you
stabbed me in the back,

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:23.530
taking my fans, my sponsors, my
lucrative endorsement deals,

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.364
my Parking space!

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.169
You were my hero.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.851
Now you're no better
than Nefarious!

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.763
How dare you.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.771
I am way better-looking
than Nefarious!

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.405
I'm taking you in.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.282
By force, if necessary.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.171
Oh, wittle wombax
with a wittle gun!

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.601
Huh.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.725
Qwark, stop!
You don't want to do this!

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.928
Don't tell me what I want to do!

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.123
On your left, Ratchet.
Now your right.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.641
Huh?

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:07.126
Enough, Qwark!

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.881
Whoa!

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.610
Nefarious is tricking you! He wants
you to destroy the entire system!

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.406
Oh, that's right,
you know everything.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.561
Uh-oh!

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.241
Hey, why don't we all
just listen to Ratchet?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.206
Ratchet, look out!

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.281
Whoa!

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.881
Oh, my-

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.764
Buzz Blades? I taught
you better than that!

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.324
Some of it got in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.209
He's just too good.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.531
Oh, dear.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.966
Whoa!

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.161
Clank!

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.489
Tornado Launcher!

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.288
Nefarious may be a homicidal lunatic,
but he sure can build a gun.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.444
Qwark, please!
You're not a villain!

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.727
You're not like Nefarious.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.007
This isn't you, and you know it!

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.170
If Umbris is destroyed, everyone
will die, including us!

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.406
Is that how you
want to be remembered?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:57.005
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:59.842
I don't know how
things got this far.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.002
This is just pathetic!

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.765
Nefarious.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.764
Give it up. It's over.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.931
As head of
the Galactic Rangers, uh,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.651
he's here to place
you under arrest.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.721
Me?

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.847
Absolutely.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.209
Arrest this man for his speakable
crimes against the galaxy.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.691
My crimes?

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.889
The real crime is
how you treated me!

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.523
The Rangers couldn't even
give me a proper laboratory!

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.443
We have an operational budget!

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.285
You called me
"King of the Nerd Herd!"

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.767
it was a term of endearment!

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.282
Day after day, I slaved away,

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.244
creating all the weapons
and devices

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.687
that made you look like a hero.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.448
But you're not a hero. You're
not even a good villain!

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.807
You're the galaxy's
biggest joke.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.366
Maybe.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.643
But now the last laugh
is on you.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.241
Wait, what?
That didn't make any sense.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.049
Sure it did.
No, it didn't.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.963
It sounded like
you were combining

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.566
"The joke is on you" with
"I'll have the last laugh."

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.086
Take your pick.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.810
That's not how it works!

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:14.321
Get ready to engage
mag-boosters!

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.528
Ratchet and Clank
are still inside.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.162
Drek's going to fire at any moment!
We don't have any more time!

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.164
My point is,

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.925
if you're going to use a
one-liner, it should make sense,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.480
and be relevant
to the situation!

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.885
Look, I workshop thousands of these
a year, and they can't all be gold!

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.564
Now, put your hands in the air!

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.404
Over your dead body!

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.881
Whoa!

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.126
Incoming.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.163
Whoa!

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.120
Mommy!

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:03.966
<i>Dialing</i> Mother.

01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.042
<i>Hello, Horkelberg residence!</i>

Full power!

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.160
It's working.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.401
Stay with it.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.326
Steady now! Steady!

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.171
Whoa!

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.651
What's happening?

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.281
Whoa!

Don't let him turn it on!

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.967
Get off me, you has-been!

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.882
You know, maybe Drek was right.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.244
I am a mad scientist.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.961
Whoo-hoo! They missed!

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.806
Lousy, insolent, idiotic...

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.165
Break off. Break off!

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.971
Copy that.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.321
<i>Ratchet, you have to
get out of there now!</i>

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.844
<i>Weapon locker depleted.</i>

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:13.961
Hmm.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.164
Yeah.
We're working on it.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:23.362
No! My plan!
You've ruined my plan!

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.522
You've had this one coming
a long time, Qwark!

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.891
Of all my brilliant creations,

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.725
it remains one of my favorites.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.322
Hey, Nefarious?
What?

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.642
Meet the Omniwrench.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:12.651
<i>Warning. Now

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.280

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.561
Hmm.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.326
Come on, guys.
Get out of there. Come on!

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.720
They'll never
make it out in time.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.921
We've got to help.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.241
It's too late.
There's nothing we can do.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.407
We must find
one of Drek's teleporters!

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.687
I saw one on the bridge!
Watch out!

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.010
Hang on, boys.

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.525
It's here! Hit the brakes!

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.000
Relax, I know what...

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.450
Qwark!
Oh, no.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.967
I can't reach you in time.
Just get out while you can!

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.088
<i>Teleporter charging.</i>
Hmm.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.921
What are you doing?

01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.525
Improvising!

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.761
Oh!

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.647
Are we dead?

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.761
Huh?

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.926
We are alive.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.321
<i>All Rangers
alive and accounted for.</i>

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:54.251
<i>Whoo! Welcome back, Rangers!
Good job!</i>

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.729
How many planets do
you think I'll have to save

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.609
for them to
call me a hero again?

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.889
You don't have to do big
things to be a hero, Qwark.

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.689
Just the right ones.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.647
Oh.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.002
I don't know, maybe it'll
be worth something someday.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.361
Hmm.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:19.930
I must say that it is curious

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.129
that the sudden cessation of
velocity relative to our inertia

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.043
did not cause
either of you to...

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.567
Oh, dear.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.491
Don't worry, Cadet.
It happens to the best...

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.811
Oh, that was terrible.

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.003
On, boy.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.564
Make it stop!

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.522
Should we go
and join the others?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.008
I'd like to,
but there's a promise

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.844
I have to keep to an old friend.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.731
I understand.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.531
Don't worry. I'm sure we'll run
into each other again someday.

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.170
It's a small galaxy.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:05.005
Well, I suppose this is goodbye.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.968
You can let go now, Ratchet.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.845
Ah...

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.402
Come on, what's the holdup?

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.770
Paying good money for this.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.330
I haven't got all day!

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.976
<i>And that was the scene today</i>

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.368
<i>as thousands gathered to welcome
home the Galactic Rangers,</i>

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.922
<i>making their triumphant return
from saving our galaxy.</i>

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.886
<i>Grateful citizens gathered
at the famed Hall of Heroes</i>

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:44.123
<i>to mark this day that will live
in hearts and minds forever.</i>

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:46.487
<i>As for Private Qwark,
the recently demoted Ranger</i>

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.245
<i>will embark upon
his galaxy-wide apology tour</i>

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.687
<i>while shamelessly
promoting his new book,</i>

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.127
Listen, I Said I
Was Sorry, All Right?

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.929
<i>When asked for a comment, the
former captain had this to offer.</i>

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.646
<i>Prepare to be blown away
by my epic humility.</i>

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.491
<i>There was, however, one curious
absence from today's festivities,</i>

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:13.724
<i>that of new Ranger sensation
and media darling, Ratchet,</i>

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.327
<i>leaving this reporter
with one question.</i>

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.927
<i>What does a Lombax do
after saving the galaxy?</i>

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.968
<i>We may never know.</i>

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:25.886
<i>And now, a story about a baby
glypod who can play the ukulele.</i>

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.442
Come on, we haven't got all day!

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:31.126
We have 10 more proton
scrubs to do before lunch

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.964
if we want to stay on schedule!

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.721
I've got to be honest,

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.207
I kind of thought you'd be
so touched by the gesture,

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:39.123
you'd call us even.

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.928
Well, you thought wrong,
didn't you?

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.842
Ah, keep your shirt on, I heard you.
You see these ears?

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.246
Hey! Wait! Wait! Please wait for me!
I have abandonment issues!

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.844
Might I offer a suggestion?

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.927
Modifying that proton scrubber
with a Gadgetron quasar flash

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.288
would increase your
efficiency by 47.4%.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.690
A quasar flash, huh?
Gee, I don't know.

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.049
That kind of tech
takes two to operate.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:18.040
And Grim's not as nimble
as he used to be.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.443
Then perhaps I could
remain here and assist,

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.841
if you do not mind me
staying around a while.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.921
You kidding?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.526
Things have been way too quiet
without you around.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.042
I do bring a certain level of
zing to the table, don't I?

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.651
Yeah, Clank.
You're a real wild one.

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.926
Speaking of which,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.527
am I to assume that you have
retired from the Galactic Rangers?

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.407
Nah. Once a Ranger,
always a Ranger.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.209
Believe me,
the minute somebody tries

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.726
to blow up another planet,
I'll be ready to go.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.246
But, hey, what are the odds
of that happening?

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.446
Precisely 87,534 to one.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.721
Yep.
A real wild one.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.449
No! Get away from me!

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.803
Do not stick that thing in...

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.484
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.446
Quit trying to
repair me, you moron!

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.525
I am not a robot!

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.043
Huh? Are you still here?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.522
All the logos and doohickeys
already went by.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.169
That means it's over.
Move along.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:39.811
No extra little scene
at the end of the movie.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:43.087
If I find out who
started that nonsense,

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.288
why, I'm going to
plant my boot so far up...

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.808
I said, beat it!

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:48.881
Sheesh!
