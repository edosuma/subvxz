- No.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.507

00:51.802 --> 00:53.638
why are they taking pictures
of us?

00:53.763 --> 00:55.139

that you're Pauly Shore

00:55.264 --> 00:57.099

- Okay.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.352

03:01.474 --> 03:02.808
That's why I was walking
funny earlier.

What do you mean?
We're stealing beer.

doesn't do anything.

most perverted thing

05:03.137 --> 05:05.055

Okay, I don't know exactly.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.229
I'd probably-
I'd take her to France,

05:12.354 --> 05:14.648
and we'd, uh-
we would ride bicycles,

05:14.773 --> 05:17.526
and afterwards maybe
I'd steal a smooch or two.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.486
I'd give her a kiss, man.

05:19.612 --> 05:22.948

What, I'll fist her
or something, man?

Just say I want to, like,

05:27.536 --> 05:29.496

and start slapping 'em around

with a-

05:33.417 --> 05:34.919
- Well, don't be a psychopath.
You don't have to do that.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.420
Have normal sex with them.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.172
- Then I'm gonna fuck her
probably.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.424
- Oh, probably? Why'd you throw
the "probably" in there?

05:40.549 --> 05:42.176
- Because I don't know
if she's gonna let me.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.594
I'm not gonna, you know-
- Okay.

it's driving away-
