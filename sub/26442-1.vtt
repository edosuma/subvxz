Dylan:
Yeah, it's so stupid.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.121
I mean, you probably want
someone to go make fun of you

18:08.155 --> 18:09.422
while you're there, right?

18:09.456 --> 18:10.990
Yeah, well,
I'd love the company

18:11.023 --> 18:13.393
of a woman who's being honest
with herself.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.061
Oh, my God.
Why are you still here?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.130
Hey, California.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.432
Oh, no.
How many are there?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.067
Uh, you're not
gonna be stoked.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.235
-I like your necklace.
-Me too.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.471
Oi! You slags.
We saw him first.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.605
Are you daft?

18:25.638 --> 18:28.408
[ Surfer accent ]
Everybody, just chill out!

18:28.441 --> 18:31.077
[ Sighs ]
I'm not who you think I am.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.746
I'm not gnarly.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.083
[ Normal voice ]
I am not gnarly.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.086
I'm Ray,
and I want this to stop

18:40.119 --> 18:43.089
so I can visit museums
and enunciate consonants.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.357
**

18:44.391 --> 18:46.493
I haven't been true
to myself, either.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.928
But unlike Ray, in my case,
it's a bad thing.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.863
I don't always like sharing
a room with two boys.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.800
A world full of jumping
on people, pinning them
down, and farting on them.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.035
That's you, only you,
every time.

18:56.068 --> 18:59.372
I like things that might not
make me seem tough or cool.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.475
And darn it,
I love the royals.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.812
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really need to know

19:05.845 --> 19:09.115
what kind of yogurt toppings
Lady Rose likes.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.118
And I need to go check
the return policy at PacSun.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.221
Good luck, guys.
Sorry.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.357
[ Sighs ] This is dumb.
We should go down.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.392
**

19:19.426 --> 19:21.027
It's gonna take forever
with just me.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.229
You'd do that for me?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.898
The first time
I saw your face --

19:25.932 --> 19:27.667
-Oh!
-Stupid Americans.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.635
Sorry, sorry.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.204
Kenneth! Kenneth!
I told them.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.739
I admitted
I love the royals.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.674
It felt great.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.810
Ladies, this is Dylan.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.546
She's one of us.
[ Scatter greetings ]

19:39.579 --> 19:41.648
Oh, I, uh...

19:41.681 --> 19:42.682
I got you something.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.686
**

19:46.719 --> 19:49.055
-It's Lady Gilman!
-Where?

19:49.088 --> 19:52.859
-Oh. Oh!
-Lady Gilman! I love you!

19:52.892 --> 19:54.361
I love you!
-Oh, Lady Gilman!

19:54.394 --> 19:57.230
She looked at me!
She just looked at me!

19:57.264 --> 20:00.500
So, you live in California,
but where exactly?

20:00.533 --> 20:03.503
Well, it's convenient

20:03.536 --> 20:06.406
that you ask
about where we live, bec--

20:06.439 --> 20:07.507
Ooh, Daddy,
careful.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.076
Oh! That's nice.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.512
[ Mumbling ] I don't know.
I can't...

20:12.545 --> 20:15.081
Well, bound to be another one.
[ Chuckles ]

20:15.114 --> 20:17.350
I can't believe
this feeling.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.386
I feel so at peace.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.953
Woman:
...after Albert and...

20:20.987 --> 20:24.223
You are an eyesore
and an abomination!

20:24.257 --> 20:28.528
Take the next left and explore
the bottom of the Thames!

20:28.561 --> 20:31.030
You see, I always knew
we'd see each other again,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.700
but I thought when you came,
you'd might, you know,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.403
be asking for help or money,
something like that,

20:36.436 --> 20:39.706
but you just came
to see me.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.774
Makes a difference.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.445
**

20:45.478 --> 20:48.915
So, tell me about
this house of yours.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.823
[ Grunts ]

20:56.856 --> 20:58.558
Whoa.

20:58.591 --> 21:03.095
Oh, yeah. We did it.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.298
"You did."

21:05.332 --> 21:06.733
Eh, yeah.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.268
What'd I say, huh?
Best view in the city.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.172
Oh, hey.
It's the London Eye.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.241
That wasn't here
last time I was.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.410
So, like I said,

21:17.444 --> 21:20.913
it's the best view of that...

21:20.947 --> 21:23.282
completely accessible thing

21:23.316 --> 21:23.383
with a better view.
