00:01.867 --> 00:02.902
{\an1}&gt;&gt; "TRUE JACKSON, VP"

00:02.969 --> 00:03.836
{\an1}WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.903 --> 00:10.377
{\an1}OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.443 --> 00:12.112
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, DO WE HAVE AN ETA

00:12.178 --> 00:13.146
{\an1}ON MAX?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.347
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HIS PLANE LANDED AN HOUR AGO.

00:14.414 --> 00:15.515
{\an1}HE SHOULD BE HERE SHORTLY.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.216
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I'D LIKE EVERYTHING

00:16.282 --> 00:17.350
{\an1}TO BE PERFECT WHEN HE ARRIVES,

00:17.417 --> 00:18.051
{\an1}SO PLEASE

00:18.118 --> 00:21.721
{\an1}STRAIGHTEN UP YOUR DESK.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.356
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LITTLE HELP?

00:23.423 --> 00:23.923
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:23.990 --> 00:25.291
{\an1}YOU'RE DOING?

00:25.358 --> 00:25.892
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK

00:25.959 --> 00:26.893
{\an1}I'M PLAYING DODGEBALL

00:26.960 --> 00:28.962
{\an1}WITH ELLA IN ACCOUNTING, WHY?

00:29.028 --> 00:29.729
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I MAY HAVE MENTIONED THIS

00:29.796 --> 00:30.530
{\an1}ONCE OR TWICE,

00:30.597 --> 00:32.799
{\an1}BUT THIS IS A PLACE OF BUSINESS,

00:32.866 --> 00:34.067
{\an1}NOT A PLAYGROUND.

00:34.134 --> 00:34.768
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH.

00:34.834 --> 00:35.735
{\an1}WELL, THEN HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

00:35.802 --> 00:42.142
{\an1}ALL THE SAND IN MY SHOE?

00:42.208 --> 00:46.446
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BALL.

00:46.513 --> 00:47.480
{\an1}HAVE FUN.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.816
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU KNOWS IT.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.350
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, AMANDA,

00:50.417 --> 00:51.317
{\an1}IS IT OKAY IF A COLLEGE STUDENT

00:51.384 --> 00:53.153
{\an1}FOLLOWS ME AROUND FOR A DAY?

00:53.219 --> 00:53.987
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY FOR WHOM?

00:54.053 --> 00:54.387
{\an1}I IMAGINE

00:54.454 --> 00:55.021
{\an1}IT WOULD BE VERY BORING

00:55.088 --> 00:58.124
{\an1}FOR THIS PERSON.

00:58.191 --> 00:59.092
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HER NAME'S JUDY.

00:59.159 --> 00:59.859
{\an1}SHE SENT ME A LETTER

00:59.926 --> 01:00.560
{\an1}ASKING ME IF SHE COULD SEE

01:00.627 --> 01:01.194
{\an1}WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WORK

01:01.261 --> 01:02.595
{\an1}IN FASHION.

01:02.662 --> 01:03.296
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S FINE WITH ME,

01:03.363 --> 01:03.830
{\an1}BUT YOU MIGHT WANT

01:03.897 --> 01:04.697
{\an1}TO RUN IT BY MAX.

01:04.763 --> 01:05.932
{\an1}HE'S GOT SOMETHING BIG

01:05.999 --> 01:07.133
{\an1}PLANNED FOR US TODAY.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.600
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

01:07.667 --> 01:08.435
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY,

01:08.501 --> 01:09.035
{\an1}BUT I WOULD IMAGINE

01:09.102 --> 01:10.136
{\an1}IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

01:10.203 --> 01:12.439
{\an1}WITH HIS TRIP TO AFRICA.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.339
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY PARENTS WENT TO AFRICA

01:13.406 --> 01:14.507
{\an1}FOR THEIR HONEYMOON.

01:14.574 --> 01:14.974
{\an1}I DON'T THINK

01:15.041 --> 01:16.075
{\an1}THEY HAD A GOOD TIME, THOUGH.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.310
{\an1}MY DAD WAS ALL WORKED UP

01:17.377 --> 01:18.178
{\an1}BECAUSE THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT

01:18.244 --> 01:20.113
{\an1}ONLY GAVE THEM ONE BAG OF NUTS.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.448
{\an1}I MEAN, HE STILL TALKS ABOUT IT.

01:21.514 --> 01:22.182
{\an1}MY MOM'S LIKE,

01:22.248 --> 01:30.723
{\an1}"LET IT GO, LARRY."

01:30.790 --> 01:32.258
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SOMETHING WRONG, LULU?

01:32.325 --> 01:33.693
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, SORT OF.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.261
{\an1}I WAS TEXTING WITH MIKEY J,

01:35.328 --> 01:38.064
{\an1}AND HE WROTE ME THIS.

01:38.131 --> 01:38.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T GET IT.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.334
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEITHER DO I.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.001
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE

01:42.068 --> 01:44.771
{\an1}A PENGUIN IF YOU SQUINT.

01:44.838 --> 01:45.271
{\an1}WERE YOU TALKING

01:45.338 --> 01:46.372
{\an1}ABOUT PENGUINS?

01:46.439 --> 01:47.574
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, WE WERE BEING

01:47.640 --> 01:48.341
{\an1}KIND OF FRIENDLY,

01:48.408 --> 01:49.409
{\an1}BUT ALSO KIND OF FLIRTY,

01:49.476 --> 01:49.976
{\an1}AND THEN I ASKED HIM

01:50.043 --> 01:50.410
{\an1}IF HE WANTED

01:50.477 --> 01:51.311
{\an1}TO HANG OUT SOMETIME,

01:51.377 --> 01:52.378
{\an1}AND THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE,

01:52.445 --> 01:55.014
{\an1}AND THEN HE SENT ME THIS.

01:55.081 --> 01:55.782
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAYBE AMANDA KNOWS.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.816
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

01:56.883 --> 01:57.750
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, AMANDA,

01:57.817 --> 01:58.852
{\an1}YOU GO OUT WITH BOYS,

01:58.918 --> 02:00.687
{\an1}WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU?

02:00.753 --> 02:01.387
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT MEANS YOUR CELL PHONE

02:01.454 --> 02:02.822
{\an1}IS BROKEN.

02:02.889 --> 02:03.323
{\an1}THERE'S NOTHING

02:03.389 --> 02:04.090
{\an1}BUT A BUNCH OF UNRELATED LETTERS

02:04.157 --> 02:06.292
{\an1}AND PUNCTUATION MARKS.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.527
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S AN EMOTICON.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.027
{\an1}YOU KNOW, LIKE HAPPY OR SAD

02:09.095 --> 02:10.864
{\an1}OR CONFUSED.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.131
{\an1}DON'T YOU USE THEM?

02:12.198 --> 02:13.566
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I EXPRESS MY FEELINGS

02:13.633 --> 02:14.601
{\an1}WITH ACTUAL WORDS,

02:14.667 --> 02:15.568
{\an1}LIKE HAPPY OR SAD

02:15.635 --> 02:19.305
{\an1}OR NOT INTERESTED.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.340
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:20.406 --> 02:21.841
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.443
{\an1}YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.078
{\an1}MAN, ISN'T IT HOT IN HERE?

02:25.144 --> 02:26.212
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, RIGHT?

02:26.279 --> 02:40.093

{\an1}TRUE, WHEN I WAS IN UGANDA,

04:02.709 --> 04:03.676
{\an1}I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME

04:03.743 --> 04:05.311
{\an1}WITH THE BAGANDA TRIBE.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.546
{\an1}I TOLD THE TRIBAL ELDERS

{\an1}THEY WANTED YOU TO HAVE THIS.

04:13.853 --> 04:15.021
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S AMAZING.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.889
{\an1}I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T GET A GOAT.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.291

{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST BE GLAD

06:08.968 --> 06:10.369
{\an1}YOU DIDN'T GET A GOAT.

06:10.436 --> 06:11.070
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THAT REMINDS ME,

06:11.137 --> 06:12.004
{\an1}I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR ELLA

06:12.071 --> 06:13.206
{\an1}IN ACCOUNTING.

06:13.272 --> 06:22.648
{\an1}[GOAT BLEATS]

06:22.715 --> 06:23.683
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUDY?

06:23.750 --> 06:24.317
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, HI.

06:24.383 --> 06:25.384
{\an1}I WAS JUST PLAYING SCRUNCH

06:25.451 --> 06:27.286
{\an1}ON YOUR COMPUTER.

06:27.353 --> 06:28.488
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S SCRUNCH?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.189
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, YOU DON'T PLAY SCRUNCH?

06:30.256 --> 06:30.957
{\an1}IT'S THIS GREAT GAME

06:31.023 --> 06:31.858
{\an1}WHERE ALL THESE BEARS

06:31.924 --> 06:32.592
{\an1}WEAR LIPSTICK

06:32.658 --> 06:33.693
{\an1}AND THEY TRY TO KISS YOU,

06:33.760 --> 06:34.393
{\an1}SO YOU HAVE TO HIDE

06:34.460 --> 06:35.094
{\an1}BEFORE THEY TURN YOU

06:35.161 --> 06:36.596
{\an1}COMPLETELY RED.

06:36.662 --> 06:37.830
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I HAD A NIGHTMARE LIKE THAT

06:37.897 --> 06:38.364
{\an1}ONE TIME.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.732
{\an1}BUT EXCEPT INSTEAD OF BEARS,

06:39.799 --> 06:40.900
{\an1}IT WAS MY AUNT TONISHA.

06:40.967 --> 06:41.434
{\an1}I MEAN, I WOKE UP

06:41.501 --> 06:42.502
{\an1}SCREAMING SO LOUD

06:42.568 --> 06:43.436
{\an1}MY DAD JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW

06:43.503 --> 06:44.837
{\an1}AND BROKE HIS LEG.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.772
{\an1}THEN MY AUNT TONISHA CAME

06:45.838 --> 06:51.244
{\an1}AND STAYED WITH US.

06:51.310 --> 06:52.879
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.

06:52.945 --> 06:53.913
{\an1}WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

06:53.980 --> 06:55.214
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAYBE JUDY HAS AN IDEA.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.716
{\an1}SHE'S IN COLLEGE.

06:56.783 --> 06:57.950
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN COLLEGE?

06:58.017 --> 07:00.253
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES. WHY, DO I LOOK DUMB?

07:00.319 --> 07:03.122
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, OLD.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.290
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.124
{\an1}&gt;&gt; EVERYBODY IN COLLEGE

07:05.191 --> 07:06.125
{\an1}LOOKS LIKE ME.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.126
{\an1}I LOVE COLLEGE.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.027
{\an1}WE DRINK MILK SHAKES

07:08.094 --> 07:09.462
{\an1}AND SLEEP IN BUNK BEDS.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.731
{\an1}YEAH, I CAN'T READ THIS.

07:11.798 --> 07:12.598
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW, RIGHT?

07:12.665 --> 07:14.500
{\an1}IT'S FROM THIS BOY, MIKEY J.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.068
{\an1}I CAN'T TELL IF HE LIKES ME.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.069
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE TOTALLY LIKES YOU.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.104
{\an1}WHY ELSE WOULD HE SPEND

07:18.171 --> 07:19.972
{\an1}TWO SOLID YEARS AVOIDING YOU?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.375
{\an1}THAT'S DEDICATION.

07:22.441 --> 07:24.811
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN WE TAKE THAT TOUR NOW?

07:24.877 --> 07:26.012
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, RYAN WANTS US TO MEET HIM

07:26.078 --> 07:27.079
{\an1}DOWNSTAIRS AT HAPPYBERRY.

07:27.146 --> 07:27.647
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.714
{\an1}YOU LIKE YOGURT, RIGHT, JUDY?

07:28.781 --> 07:29.448
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

07:29.515 --> 07:30.483
{\an1}WE HAVE A HIP-HOP YOGURT SHOP

07:30.550 --> 07:33.719
{\an1}ON CAMPUS, YO YO YO GURT.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.687
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, OSCAR, IT'S COOL

07:34.754 --> 07:35.855
{\an1}IF WE GO GET SOME YOGURT, RIGHT?

07:35.922 --> 07:36.422
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES,

07:36.489 --> 07:37.657
{\an1}BUT WASH YOUR HANDS FIRST.

07:37.723 --> 07:38.624
{\an1}BOTH SIDES.

07:38.691 --> 07:39.525
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE'S KIDDING.

07:39.592 --> 07:40.426
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.060
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR,

07:41.127 --> 07:44.030
{\an1}I'M TRYING TO LOOK COOL HERE.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.765
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, JUDY, THIS IS AMANDA.

07:45.832 --> 07:46.699
{\an1}AMANDA, THIS IS JUDY,

07:46.766 --> 07:47.266
{\an1}THE COLLEGE STUDENT

07:47.333 --> 07:48.100
{\an1}I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.068
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, A PLEASURE.

07:49.135 --> 07:49.769
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON,

07:49.836 --> 07:50.336
{\an1}AMANDA?

07:50.403 --> 07:51.137
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AN EXCITING NEW PROJECT

07:51.204 --> 07:53.539
{\an1}CALLED NONE OF YOUR BEESWAX.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.774
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

07:54.841 --> 07:55.374
{\an1}SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT

07:55.441 --> 07:57.443
{\an1}TO TELL YOU.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.477
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OSCAR, DO YOU MIND

07:58.544 --> 07:59.779
{\an1}IF I KEEP MY MUG HERE

07:59.846 --> 08:01.280
{\an1}FOR SAFEKEEPING?

08:01.347 --> 08:04.283
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL, DON'T--

08:04.350 --> 08:05.518
{\an1}IS IT OKAY?

08:05.585 --> 08:12.425
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

08:12.491 --> 08:26.839
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT NOW?

08:26.906 --> 08:28.641
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:28.708 --> 08:29.041
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH,

08:29.108 --> 08:30.643
{\an1}IT'S JUST A LITTLE EXPERIMENT.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.310
{\an1}I'M SEEING HOW LONG

08:31.377 --> 08:32.445
{\an1}I CAN POUR WATER BACK AND FORTH

08:32.510 --> 08:33.346
{\an1}BETWEEN TWO CUPS

08:33.412 --> 08:35.681
{\an1}BEFORE THE MANAGER KICKS ME OUT.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.350
{\an1}IT'S BEEN OVER AN HOUR.

08:37.416 --> 08:44.323
{\an1}THIS GUY'S TERRIBLE.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.392
{\an1}I'LL BET HE'S A SPY.

08:46.459 --> 08:49.829
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT THIS AGAIN.

08:49.896 --> 08:50.897
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, THIS IS JUDY.

08:50.963 --> 08:54.367
{\an1}SHE'S A COLLEGE STUDENT.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.835
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A COLLEGE STUDENT?

08:55.902 --> 08:58.638
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FO' SHIZZLE.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.972
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY IS MR. MADIGAN WEARING

09:00.039 --> 09:01.474
{\an1}HIS BATHROBE TO WORK TODAY?

09:01.540 --> 09:02.141
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A BATHROBE.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.010
{\an1}IT'S A DASHIKI, YOU KNOW,

09:04.076 --> 09:05.544
{\an1}HE GOT IT ON HIS TRIP TO AFRICA.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.113
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE?

09:07.179 --> 09:07.580
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I BET

09:07.647 --> 09:08.748
{\an1}HE WAS RIDING ZEBRAS.

09:08.814 --> 09:09.282
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW HE FOUND

09:09.348 --> 09:10.549
{\an1}THIS REALLY RARE FABRIC.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.919
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MADE OUT OF ZEBRAS?

09:12.985 --> 09:13.586
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

09:13.653 --> 09:14.353
{\an1}WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.855
{\an1}IT'S REALLY TOP SECRET.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.090
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH GOODY, I LOVE TO GOSSIP.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.058
{\an1}WHAT'S IT REALLY MADE OF?

09:19.125 --> 09:19.659
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SURE.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.327
{\an1}TREES OR SOMETHING.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.528
{\an1}HE'S CALLING IT A MUTUBA CLOTH.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.096
{\an1}&gt;&gt; A MUTUBA.

09:24.163 --> 09:24.764
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, CAN I TALK TO YOU

09:24.830 --> 09:29.001
{\an1}FOR A SECOND REAL FAST?

09:29.068 --> 09:29.735
{\an1}YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA

09:29.802 --> 09:30.236
{\an1}TALKING ABOUT

09:30.303 --> 09:31.837
{\an1}MR. MADIGAN'S SECRETS?

09:31.904 --> 09:32.838
{\an1}WHAT IF SHE'S A SPY?

09:32.905 --> 09:33.806
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN, YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST

09:33.873 --> 09:34.674
{\an1}PEOPLE A LITTLE.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.174
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.042
{\an1}WELL AT THE VERY LEAST,

09:36.108 --> 09:42.281
{\an1}MAKE HER PINKY PROMISE.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.883
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, JUDY,

09:43.950 --> 09:44.684
{\an1}YOU WON'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT

09:44.750 --> 09:45.785
{\an1}WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT,

09:45.851 --> 09:46.852
{\an1}WILL YOU?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.121
{\an1}IT'S TOP SECRET.

09:49.188 --> 09:50.556
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.724
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.760
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PINKY PROMISE.

09:54.827 --> 09:55.428
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK, I HATE TO DO THIS

09:55.494 --> 09:55.828
{\an1}TO YOU

09:55.895 --> 09:56.629
{\an1}BUT WOULD YOU MIND

09:56.696 --> 09:57.663
{\an1}PINKY-PROMISING?

09:57.730 --> 09:58.197
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, IF THAT'S

09:58.264 --> 10:00.066
{\an1}WHAT YOU WANT.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.701
{\an1}I WILL NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT

10:01.767 --> 10:05.471
{\an1}MR. MADIGAN'S MUTUBA CLOTH.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.872
{\an1}OH, IT'S MY R.A.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.573
{\an1}I PROBABLY LEFT

10:07.640 --> 10:08.774
{\an1}THE STEREO ON AGAIN.

10:08.841 --> 10:10.943
{\an1}I SHOULD TAKE THIS.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.111
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M GETTING YOGURT.

10:12.178 --> 10:12.611
{\an1}WHO WANTS?

10:13.546 --> 10:15.081
{\an1}CAN YOU GET GO GO BEARS ON MINE?

10:15.147 --> 10:15.915
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FORGET IT.

10:15.982 --> 10:16.916
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE GO GO BEARS?

10:16.983 --> 10:17.683
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SUGAR BALLS FILLED

10:17.750 --> 10:18.884
{\an1}WITH AN ENERGY DRINK.

10:18.951 --> 10:19.685
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW A GUY

10:19.752 --> 10:20.453
{\an1}WHO HAD TWO SERVINGS

10:20.519 --> 10:23.823
{\an1}AND LITERALLY OUTRAN A COUGAR.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.091
{\an1}SO CAN I PLEASE GET SOME?

10:25.157 --> 10:26.258
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

10:26.325 --> 10:27.193
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, RYAN,

10:27.259 --> 10:31.797
{\an1}WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

10:31.864 --> 10:33.065
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY INTERESTING.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.500
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OOH, YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.836
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, MY FINGER'S BLEEDING.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.004
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.

10:38.070 --> 10:38.637
{\an1}I ASKED MIKEY J.

10:38.704 --> 10:39.438
{\an1}IF HE WANTED TO HANG OUT

10:39.505 --> 10:41.407
{\an1}AND THAT'S WHAT HE WROTE BACK.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.608
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

10:42.675 --> 10:43.075
{\an1}JUST SEND HIM

10:43.142 --> 10:44.310
{\an1}A CRAZY EMOTICON BACK.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.312
{\an1}PUT THE BALL IN HIS COURT.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.080
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.448
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I'M FULL OF GOOD IDEAS.

10:49.515 --> 10:50.116
{\an1}LIKE MY IDEA

10:50.182 --> 10:52.051
{\an1}FOR THE POCKET CHEESE GRATER.

10:52.118 --> 10:53.019
{\an1}ACTUALLY I HAVE ONE WITH ME.

10:53.085 --> 10:56.288
{\an1}OW.

10:56.355 --> 11:06.499
{\an1}OH, NOT AGAIN.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.533
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, THERE YOU ARE.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.200
{\an1}IT'S A CODE YELLOW

11:08.267 --> 11:09.568
{\an1}IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, STAT.

11:09.635 --> 11:10.603
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:10.669 --> 11:11.237
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S AN EMERGENCY

11:11.303 --> 11:12.071
{\an1}STAFF MEETING.

11:12.138 --> 11:12.905
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN I COME?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.206
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.

11:14.273 --> 11:14.907
{\an1}HANG IN MY OFFICE

11:14.974 --> 11:15.808
{\an1}TILL I GET BACK.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.244
{\an1}PLAY SOME SCRUNCH.

11:18.310 --> 11:24.717
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT?

11:24.784 --> 11:25.317
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIT DOWN, TRUE.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.820
{\an1}I NEED ALL MY TOP EXECUTIVES.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.056
{\an1}WHERE'S KOPELMAN?

11:30.122 --> 11:31.590
{\an1}I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

11:31.657 --> 11:32.691
{\an1}IT WAS WRONG OF ME TO THROW YOU

11:32.758 --> 11:34.560
{\an1}OUT OF THE MEETING EARLIER.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.061
{\an1}BUT THIS MEETING

11:35.127 --> 11:35.761
{\an1}IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT,

11:35.828 --> 11:36.495
{\an1}SO GET OUT.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.598
{\an1}OUT.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.466
{\an1}I'VE JUST BEEN INFORMED THAT

11:40.533 --> 11:41.367
{\an1}SIMON CRISTINI HAS FOUND OUT

11:41.434 --> 11:43.536

{\an1}AND IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE IT

11:44.503 --> 11:46.005
{\an1}AS HIS OWN DISCOVERY.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.239
{\an1}WE HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY.

11:47.306 --> 11:47.773
{\an1}I HAVE MOVED

11:47.840 --> 11:48.474
{\an1}THE PRESS CONFERENCE

11:48.541 --> 11:49.642
{\an1}TO 3:00 TODAY.

11:49.708 --> 11:50.409
{\an1}&gt;&gt; 3:00?

11:50.476 --> 11:51.710
{\an1}IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

11:51.777 --> 11:52.311
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.145
{\an1}BUT DON'T WORRY,

11:53.212 --> 11:54.480
{\an1}DORIS HAS ASKED HER COUSIN

11:54.547 --> 11:55.214
{\an1}TO HELP US OUT

11:55.281 --> 11:57.249
{\an1}AS A SPOKES-OMELET.

11:57.316 --> 11:57.817
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID YOU JUST SAY

11:57.883 --> 11:59.051
{\an1}SPOKES-OMELET?

11:59.118 --> 11:59.952
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID I?

12:00.019 --> 12:01.120
{\an1}I MEANT TO SAY SPOKESPERSON.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.254
{\an1}I DIDN'T HAVE BREAKFAST

12:02.321 --> 12:03.856
{\an1}THIS MORNING.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.925
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DORIS' COUSIN, HOW EXCITING.

12:05.991 --> 12:06.525
{\an1}I'M SURE THE PRESS

12:06.592 --> 12:07.059
{\an1}WILL BE CLAMORING

12:07.126 --> 12:08.427
{\an1}FOR THAT EXCLUSIVE.

12:08.494 --> 12:08.994

{\an1}&gt;&gt; AL GORE?

12:11.797 --> 12:12.832
{\an1}THE FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT?

12:12.898 --> 12:13.499
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.633
{\an1}BUT LET'S KEEP IT QUIET, TRUE.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.801
{\an1}WE'VE ALREADY HAD ONE SECRET

12:15.868 --> 12:17.470
{\an1}STOLEN TODAY.

12:17.536 --> 12:18.471
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE

12:18.537 --> 12:19.705
{\an1}WOULD TELL YOUR SECRET.

12:19.772 --> 12:20.906
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

12:20.973 --> 12:21.874
{\an1}IN THE BIG MONEY WORLD

12:21.941 --> 12:22.441
{\an1}OF FASHION,

12:22.508 --> 12:23.909
{\an1}SECRETS ARE VERY VALUABLE.

12:23.976 --> 12:30.816
{\an1}YOU NEVER KNOW WHO'S A SPY.

12:30.883 --> 12:33.219
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE, I--

12:33.285 --> 12:34.453
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:34.520 --> 12:37.590
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST CHILLIN' LIKE BOB DYLAN.

12:37.656 --> 12:39.558
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE NO IDEA

12:39.625 --> 12:43.362
{\an1}WHO THAT IS.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.331
{\an1}SECOND, YOU'RE HIDING A CAMERA

12:45.397 --> 12:55.341
{\an1}BEHIND YOUR BACK.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SINCE THIS IS A GREEN EVENT,

12:56.742 --> 12:57.309
{\an1}DO YOU THINK THE PODIUM

12:57.376 --> 12:58.410
{\an1}SHOULD BE GREEN?

12:58.477 --> 12:59.478
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I LOVE IT.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.381
{\an1}I MEAN, IF YOU DO.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.184
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PSST.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.019
{\an1}PSST.

13:07.086 --> 13:11.223
{\an1}PSST.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.558
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT NOW, RYAN.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.492
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

13:13.559 --> 13:14.560
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK, FINGERS BLEED,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.095
{\an1}GET OVER IT.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.230
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUDY'S A SPY.

13:18.297 --> 13:18.697
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN.

13:18.764 --> 13:19.498
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LOOK, I KNOW I THINK

13:19.565 --> 13:20.166
{\an1}EVERYONE'S A SPY,

13:20.232 --> 13:21.000
{\an1}BUT THIS TIME SHE REALLY

13:21.066 --> 13:21.934
{\an1}IS A SPY.

13:22.001 --> 13:22.668
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, AND YOU KNOW THIS

13:22.735 --> 13:25.504
{\an1}BECAUSE HOW?

13:25.571 --> 13:27.773
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SPY CAMERA.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.642
{\an1}YUP, JUDY WAS TAKING PICTURES.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.276
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAYBE SHE WAS TAKING

13:30.342 --> 13:31.944
{\an1}PICTURES FOR HER PROJECT.

13:32.011 --> 13:32.511
{\an1}AND WHAT DID SHE SAY

13:32.578 --> 13:33.312
{\an1}WHEN YOU ASKED HER?

13:33.379 --> 13:34.013
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT SHE WAS TAKING

13:34.079 --> 13:36.248
{\an1}PICTURES FOR HER PROJECT.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.383
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.317
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

13:38.384 --> 13:38.884
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,

13:38.951 --> 13:41.754
{\an1}JUST SEE FOR YOURSELF.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.955
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

13:43.022 --> 13:43.689
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK I SHOULD

13:43.756 --> 13:45.357
{\an1}STAND TALL AND PROUD

13:45.424 --> 13:48.494
{\an1}OR HUNCHED FORWARD WITH CONCERN?

13:48.561 --> 13:50.262
{\an1}A CAMERA, EXCELLENT.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.697
{\an1}YOU ALWAYS COME PREPARED, TRUE.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.132
{\an1}TAKE MY PICTURE.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.266
{\an1}JIBINI.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.467
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, IS THAT SWAHILI

13:55.534 --> 13:56.502
{\an1}FOR CHEESE?

13:56.569 --> 13:58.137
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IT'S SWAHILI FOR "OUCH."

13:58.204 --> 13:59.138
{\an1}I STUBBED MY TOE.

13:59.205 --> 14:11.317
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.751
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY.

14:19.758 --> 14:20.526
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, DO YOU HAVE TO GO

14:20.593 --> 14:21.393
{\an1}AS SOON?

14:21.460 --> 14:22.094
{\an1}'CAUSE WE REALLY DIDN'T GET

14:22.161 --> 14:23.729
{\an1}A CHANCE TO FINISH OUR TOUR.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.030
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE?

14:25.097 --> 14:27.700
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH?

14:27.766 --> 14:28.667
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IN LIGHT OF WHAT'S GOING ON,

14:28.734 --> 14:29.735
{\an1}ARE YOU SURE IT'S THE BEST IDEA

14:29.802 --> 14:30.436
{\an1}TO BE SHOWING THE OFFICE

14:30.502 --> 14:31.704
{\an1}TO STRANGERS?

14:31.770 --> 14:33.472
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT IS WITH EVERYBODY TODAY?

14:33.539 --> 14:35.908
{\an1}JUDY IS JUST A COLLEGE STUDENT.

14:35.975 --> 14:37.543
{\an1}RIGHT?

14:37.610 --> 14:38.077
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I'M SORRY

14:38.143 --> 14:39.111
{\an1}I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.312
{\an1}I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS

14:40.379 --> 14:41.714
{\an1}GREAT ROCK AND ROLL SONG

14:41.780 --> 14:45.684
{\an1}I HEARD AT COLLEGE.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.253
{\an1}CAN WE TAKE THAT TOUR NOW?

14:47.319 --> 14:53.292
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GO RIGHT THIS WAY.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.026
{\an1}OUR DESIGN DEPARTMENT

14:54.093 --> 14:56.262
{\an1}HAS OVER 600 DESIGNERS ON STAFF.

14:56.328 --> 14:57.229
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIX HUNDRED?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.664
{\an1}THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.665
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.233
{\an1}YOU CAN TAKE NOTES IF YOU WANT.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.401
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, GOOD IDEA.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.438
{\an1}HE'S LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

15:06.505 --> 15:07.506
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A RECORD?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.208
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEVER MIND.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.376
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH HEY,

15:31.430 --> 15:32.164
{\an1}DO I JUST TELL YOU

15:32.231 --> 15:33.465
{\an1}WHO I'M LOOKING FOR?

15:33.532 --> 15:34.066
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, THAT'S ALWAYS

15:34.133 --> 15:35.067
{\an1}A GOOD START.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU JUST MOVE ONE FOOT

15:50.082 --> 15:52.217
{\an1}IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.619
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO I TIP YOU?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.120

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT? BUT JUDY'S A SPY.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.071
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN THINKS

16:46.138 --> 16:47.239
{\an1}EVERYONE'S A SPY.

17:11.829 --> 17:12.964
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IN SUMMATION,

17:13.031 --> 17:14.433
{\an1}THE CLOTH OF THE MUTUBA TREE

17:14.500 --> 17:14.967
{\an1}IS UNUSABLE

17:15.032 --> 17:16.568
{\an1}SINCE THE OILS FROM THE BARK

17:16.635 --> 17:17.903
{\an1}ARE QUITE POISONOUS.

17:17.970 --> 17:18.637
{\an1}QUESTIONS?

17:18.704 --> 17:19.204
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK

{\an1}&gt;&gt; SEAFOAM GREEN AND PERIWINKLE.

17:22.273 --> 17:22.508
{\an1}YES?

17:25.477 --> 17:27.445
{\an1}AND SEVEN DOWN THE MIDDLE.

17:27.512 --> 17:28.414
{\an1}DOES OUR YOUNG STUDENT

17:28.480 --> 17:29.882
{\an1}HAVE A QUESTION?

17:29.948 --> 17:31.116
{\an1}&gt;&gt; UM, YES.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.584
{\an1}ARE YOU SAYING THAT MAD STYLE

17:32.651 --> 17:34.853
{\an1}WILL NOT BE USING MUTUBA CLOTH

17:34.920 --> 17:36.321

{\an1}GOOD REHEARSAL, EVERYBODY.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.128
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I SHOULD GET BACK

17:43.195 --> 17:43.962
{\an1}TO MY DORM.

17:44.029 --> 17:45.531
{\an1}I THINK I LEFT MY HOT PLATE ON.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.365
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T GO.

17:46.432 --> 17:47.065
{\an1}YOU GOT TO CHECK OUT ELLA

17:47.132 --> 17:47.833
{\an1}IN ACCOUNTING.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.567
{\an1}SHE'S GOT A GOAT.

17:48.634 --> 17:49.134
{\an1}IT ATE HER KEYBOARD

17:49.201 --> 17:49.701
{\an1}AND KICKED A HOLE

17:49.768 --> 17:50.369
{\an1}THROUGH THE WALL.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.171
{\an1}TOO CUTE.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.772
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, GOATS ARE DA BOMB,

{\an1}IF I BURN DOWN MY DORM,

17:55.374 --> 17:56.241
{\an1}DEAN WORMER'S GONNA GIVE ME

17:56.308 --> 17:58.377
{\an1}DOUBLE SECRET PROBATION.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.981
{\an1}BYEEE.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.273
{\an1}YOU GET IN YOUR STOMACH

19:01.340 --> 19:03.275
{\an1}WHEN YOU DRAW A DESIGN

19:03.342 --> 19:03.842
{\an1}OR WHEN YOU GET

{\an1}A REALLY GOOD IDEA

19:04.810 --> 19:07.179
{\an1}THAT YOU'RE PROUD OF?

19:07.246 --> 19:08.280
{\an1}SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DRAW

19:18.724 --> 19:19.124
{\an1}SOME PEOPLE

19:19.191 --> 19:21.293
{\an1}WILL NEVER GET THAT FEELING.

19:21.360 --> 19:21.994
{\an1}THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE

19:22.060 --> 19:31.537

{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE,

19:32.070 --> 19:32.638
{\an1}CAN YOU SAVE THREE SEATS

19:56.628 --> 19:58.363
{\an1}NOT FOR OURSELVES,

20:06.071 --> 20:06.572
{\an1}I MEAN, WHO'S TO SAY

20:06.638 --> 20:07.372
{\an1}HOW THINGS HAPPEN, RIGHT?

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, RYAN,

20:15.948 --> 20:16.615
