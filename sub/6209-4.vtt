WEBVTT

00:02.736 --> 00:05.105
Salem, those roast potatoes
came out great.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.373
Thanks for the recipe.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.275
Don't thank me,
thank Graham Kerr.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.410
I'd whip up a chocolate soufflé

00:10.410 --> 00:13.380
if I could only get my paws
around a whisk.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.448
Not to worry.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.517
I'll conjure up
some ice cream.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.319
( <i>screaming</i> )

00:21.622 --> 00:23.957
There's an eye screaming
in the freezer.

00:23.957 --> 00:28.295
Hilda, you asked for ice cream
and you got an eye screaming.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.198
I think you're coming down
with a case of punnitis.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.101
Punnitis? Me? No way.

00:34.101 --> 00:34.968
Probably my subconscious

00:34.968 --> 00:37.137
telling me I've been eating
too much sugar.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.773
Lately it's become
a real monkey on my back.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.742
Hello.

00:41.742 --> 00:45.145
Uh, do I have Davy Jones
of the Monkees on my back?

00:45.145 --> 00:46.313
Definitely.
Definitely.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.483
Okay. Maybe I've got
a touch of punnitis.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.784
That's right.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.987
No one explain what's going on
to the apparition.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.607
I can cancan. Can you?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.280
<i>So, last night</i>
<i>my dad sat me down</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:21.448
to talk about goals.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.749
Snore.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.750
I know.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.152
According to my father,

01:25.152 --> 01:28.255
my goals are: pass math, start
at least one football game,

01:28.255 --> 01:30.624
get a part-time job,
and date other girls.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.392
Date other girls?!

01:33.627 --> 01:35.262
My dad says
the teenage years

01:35.262 --> 01:37.497
are for getting to know
different kinds of girls

01:37.497 --> 01:38.565
so that later on

01:38.565 --> 01:40.567
I'll know what to look for
in a mate.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.637
Apparently I'm supposed
to watch out for gold diggers.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.172
You really want to do this?

01:45.172 --> 01:46.506
I don't have
any choice.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.508
It's either that
or military school.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.277
I hear that builds character.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.347
I don't know what
to do-- I'm trapped.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.416
Well, I guess
we could see other people...

01:56.416 --> 01:57.951
but just as friends.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.186
That's perfect.

01:59.186 --> 02:01.521
And it'll only be
for a little while.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.790
I mean, my dad comes up
with new goals for me

02:03.790 --> 02:05.425
practically every day.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.260
Think last week it was...

02:07.260 --> 02:10.130
getting through one lousy dinner
without a fight.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.832
We'll still be boyfriend
and girlfriend, right?

02:11.832 --> 02:14.201
Right. But on the sly.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.902
We'll be like Romeo and Juliet.

02:15.902 --> 02:16.937
Right.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.806
Except for
the taking poison part.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.908
ZELDA:
<i>Sabrina, we know</i>

02:21.908 --> 02:24.544
Harvey's father is
a colossal boob.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.613
But we agree with him
on this one.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.782
What? I can't believe
you're taking his side.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.316
You're young.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.451
You <i>should</i> try new things,
meet new people,

02:31.451 --> 02:33.253
have lots
of wonderful experiences.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.355
Oh, that's sounds
like a lot of fun.

02:35.355 --> 02:38.058
You need to play the field.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.828
Aunt Hilda!

02:42.629 --> 02:43.830
Sorry.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.333
It's that darn punnitis
flaring up again.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.268
A fine kettle of fish.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.704
Say it. Oh, <i>please</i> say it!

02:50.704 --> 02:52.439
Listen, I know
it's painful now,

02:52.439 --> 02:55.008
but later on, when you're
ready to settle down,

02:55.008 --> 02:56.910
you'll know what
to look for in a mate.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.979
You've got to watch out
for gold diggers.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.714
But I already see Harvey
less than I want to

03:00.714 --> 03:02.482
and I don't want to date
anyone else but him.

03:02.482 --> 03:04.785
Why don't you try
a nice witch boy?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.953
Let me say this one more time--

03:07.487 --> 03:10.390
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey,
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey!

03:10.557 --> 03:13.226
Oh, just give it
a try.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.262
Mortal boys we have a plenta.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.597
For witch fellows
we need a yenta.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.634
Oh, okay? All right.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.070
So... oh, shoot.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.538
So, who's looking?

03:24.538 --> 03:26.073
Are you okay?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.574
Yes, yes, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.642
Actually, no.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.311
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.646
Is he available for Sabrina?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.247
(gasps)
Kidding. Kidding.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.749
If this isn't a good time,
you know...

03:35.749 --> 03:38.452
No, no, it's, it's,
it's better that I keep busy.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.586
So...

03:39.586 --> 03:41.722
all right, now, this guy
is really cute.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.925
He plays the cello and the flute
and both at the same time.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.926
Huh? Huh?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.761
Harvey hates
classical music.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.829
Well, then, now,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.697
this guy, he sails
his own yacht,

03:50.697 --> 03:51.898
and lucky for you,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.134
he just got over his
mermaid obsession, huh?

03:54.134 --> 03:56.503
Wish I could say
the same for my ex.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.839
Harvey gets seasick.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.074
Look, who's getting this date,
you or this Harvey guy, huh?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.745
Sorry. Look, I think
I have to pass.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.314
Sabrina, some of these
boys are pretty cute.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.549
If I were 200
years younger...

04:09.549 --> 04:12.319
Yes, and you
still believed in love.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.488
Look, I just want Harvey
and Harvey wants me.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.790
Neither of us can imagine
being with anyone else.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.925
You have a date already?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.360
It's not really a date.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.495
My dad set me up

04:21.495 --> 04:23.630
with the daughter of
one of his clients.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.332
You know, the guy who
owns Señor Beef-O's?

04:25.332 --> 04:27.033
I love that place!

04:27.367 --> 04:29.035
But not anymore.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.372
Are you going
to be okay?

04:32.372 --> 04:34.541
Me? I'm fine.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.276
I have a date
this weekend, too.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.477
You do?

04:37.477 --> 04:38.478
With who?

04:38.812 --> 04:39.679
You know, the guy.

04:39.679 --> 04:40.480
What guy?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.683
The guy we met at the place...

04:44.684 --> 04:45.719
What place?

04:45.952 --> 04:47.988
The place where we...

04:47.988 --> 04:50.824
Why aren't you good at this?!

04:50.824 --> 04:53.026
Good at what?

04:54.327 --> 04:55.929
So, what's new
with your love life?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.597
Things are definitely
looking up.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.767
I just got the brochure
from that convent.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.437
Here's the deal:

05:04.437 --> 05:05.438
I need a date.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.540
I need one <i>now.</i>

05:06.540 --> 05:10.110
Okay. By the way, <i>he</i> called.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.978
How about that blond
guy you showed me?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.013
No, taken.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.080
Already?

05:14.080 --> 05:15.715
Well, it's Friday at 5:00.
You snooze, you lose.

05:15.715 --> 05:16.716
You hesitate, you lose a date.

05:16.716 --> 05:17.717
You linger, you...

05:17.717 --> 05:18.885
All right!

05:19.753 --> 05:21.054
There must be somebody.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.689
I have the perfect boy for you.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.057
He's a Cyclops.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.693
Yes, he is,
but he's a very good dancer.

05:26.693 --> 05:27.794
He does have

05:27.794 --> 05:29.563
a tendency to bite, though.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.997
(beeping)
Uh-oh.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.699
Oh, look, he's got
a date already.

05:32.699 --> 05:34.568
Well, you drag your feet,
you don't get to meet.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.535
Just go.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.370
I liked
her better

05:37.370 --> 05:39.039
when she was depressed.

05:39.039 --> 05:43.710
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Roz Chast just slays me!

05:43.710 --> 05:46.046
I know who we can set
Sabrina up with...

05:46.046 --> 05:47.214
Pete and Sheila's boy.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.348
What's his name?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.817
What's the matter,
cat got your tongue?

05:50.817 --> 05:57.157
Imagine the grooming
possibilities. Ooh!

05:57.157 --> 06:00.060
Oops, sorry. Still got
a little bit of punnitis.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.896
Ah, it's got cat hair on it.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.331
Welcome to my life.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.266
I remember
that boy's name--

06:06.266 --> 06:07.634
Dante.
That's it.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.236
Oh, that's a great idea--
he's adorable.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.872
Smart, cute,
laughs all the time.
Great.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.173
Course, we
haven't seen him

06:13.173 --> 06:14.741
since he was
three months old.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.477
He must be
your age by now.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.781
This is the coolest
vacuum cleaner I've seen.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.183
It's great for flying

06:23.183 --> 06:25.518
but it's a little bulky
for cleaning under the bed.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.153
These guys
are supposed to have

06:27.153 --> 06:29.122
the fastest fast food
this side of limbo.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.257
May I take your order?

06:30.257 --> 06:31.691
Two "gotta go" burgers.

06:31.691 --> 06:32.926
Coming at you.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.597
Wow, that <i>is</i> fast.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.399
Uh, two chocolate shakes.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.267
Right away.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.970
And we'll split
and order of fries.

06:43.970 --> 06:44.704
Okay.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.040
Hey!

06:47.040 --> 06:49.709
Sorry, it's my first day.

06:52.913 --> 06:53.980
Mind if I smoke?

06:53.980 --> 06:55.282
I really don't like cigarettes.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.317
I meant a ham.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.787
I hate to say it

07:00.787 --> 07:02.989
but we're a million light years
from home.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.057
I really should be heading back.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.059
First close your eyes.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.260
I got a surprise.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.935
Okay, open them.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.003
A star!

07:17.003 --> 07:18.905
It's so pretty!

07:19.172 --> 07:19.973
I was going to say
the same thing

07:19.973 --> 07:21.041
about you.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.411
What are you doing?

07:24.411 --> 07:25.879
I'm tired
of this happening.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.148
I want you to take
this punnitis medicine.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.182
Stay away from me.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.817
The last time you
brewed a home remedy

07:30.817 --> 07:32.118
it tasted like
gym shorts.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.087
But this is different.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.288
No!

07:36.990 --> 07:37.757
( <i>grunts</i> )

07:40.560 --> 07:41.962
There.

07:41.962 --> 07:46.499
I swear, sometimes
you are such a dictator.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.470
Hilda...

07:50.470 --> 07:51.972
Oops.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.275
Finally, someone I can talk
baseball with.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.610
I didn't know blind dates
could be this much fun.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.379
Me neither.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.081
I, uh...

08:01.881 --> 08:03.516
SALEM:
Out a little late, are we?

08:03.516 --> 08:04.584
Get in this house

08:04.584 --> 08:06.519
before the neighbors see.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.854
Good night.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.122
Night.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.227
So he showed me
all the cool spots
in the universe.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.929
Then he took me out
for hamburgers.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.030
I almost forgot.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.833
I had them save you guys
my leftovers.

08:21.701 --> 08:23.303
How thoughtful.

08:23.303 --> 08:27.574
Oh, and look what Dante gave me
when the date was over.

08:27.574 --> 08:28.842
Oh, what a sweet boy.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.311
I remember the first time
a boy gave me a star.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.247
The next thing I knew,
three wise men were at the door.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.281
Well, good night.

08:35.281 --> 08:35.882
Good night.

08:35.882 --> 08:37.450
Sweet dreams.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.223
She seems so happy.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.858
Remember how we used
to stay up Friday night

08:44.858 --> 08:46.659
telling each other
about our dates?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.061
We haven't done that
in ages.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.062
I know.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.631
We haven't done that because we
haven't had dates in ages.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.266
At least we have each other.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.668
Oh, my heavens,
I'm living
with my sister.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.437
I've got to call
that yenta.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.607
So, how was your date?

09:00.607 --> 09:01.808
Really fun.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.309
But now I'm worried
about Harvey.

09:03.309 --> 09:03.977
Why?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.879
I don't know
how he'll take it.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.947
We weren't actually supposed
to like the people
we went out with.

09:07.947 --> 09:08.948
Haven't you heard?

09:08.948 --> 09:10.116
He had a great time on his date
too.

09:10.116 --> 09:11.084
He did?

09:11.084 --> 09:11.918
Apparently, his date's

09:11.918 --> 09:12.919
a model or something.

09:12.919 --> 09:15.021
Isn't... that...
not particularly

09:15.021 --> 09:16.122
good information?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.726
Hey Sabrina,are you going to
finish that burrito?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.561
I had a great time
on my date, too.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.164
Oh. Well, good.

09:27.000 --> 09:27.634
This is silly.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.436
I mean, we can like
other people

09:29.436 --> 09:31.137
and still like each other.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.372
You're right.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.974
We're just doing this
for our parents anyway.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.710
We're being awfully
grown up about this, huh?

09:37.710 --> 09:39.412
Very mature.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.847
So, what's she like?

09:40.847 --> 09:42.048
Okay. What's he like?

09:42.382 --> 09:43.283
Okay.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.086
Hey, since we're being
so mature about this

09:46.086 --> 09:48.621
how about the next time
we go out on blind dates

09:48.621 --> 09:49.622
we go together?

09:49.622 --> 09:50.723
Double date?

09:51.157 --> 09:52.459
Great idea.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.127
Looks like everyone's
a winner.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.697
Oh.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.599
Excuse me, I have to go listen

09:59.599 --> 10:01.835
to one of my mom's
Janis Ian albums.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.170
You sure you're
all right with this?

10:04.170 --> 10:05.939
Absolutely. I'd love to meet...

10:05.939 --> 10:06.806
Jean.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.607
Jean.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.975
"Jean?"

10:08.975 --> 10:10.844
I never liked
the name "Jean."

10:10.977 --> 10:13.813
I never cared
for the name "Mildred."

10:13.813 --> 10:15.748
I'm curious to see
what she's like

10:15.748 --> 10:16.249
but "Jean"?

10:16.249 --> 10:17.450
I mean, Jean's not a name.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.085
It's a pair of pants.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.187
Actually, I think

10:21.187 --> 10:22.989
Jean's a very lovely name.

10:25.091 --> 10:29.229
♪ Cheer up, Sleepy Jean ♪

10:29.229 --> 10:31.698

10:33.299 --> 10:41.508

10:41.508 --> 10:43.543
Why are you here?
Nobody made a pun.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.411
Are you asking me?

10:45.411 --> 10:46.446
Oh, keep it down.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.580
We've got company.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.482
So, uh, what
do you say

10:49.482 --> 10:52.385
you and I go out,
cruise for chicks?

10:52.552 --> 10:53.453
No.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.622
Dante, come in.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.823
Hey, how you doing?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.124
You look great. Wow!

10:58.124 --> 10:59.792
Better lock
my vacuum.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.861
So, feel like
going bowling?

11:01.861 --> 11:02.662
Why not?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.796
There's a first
for everything.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.431
You've never gone
bowling before?

11:05.431 --> 11:07.901
I've never even been
in the Mortal Realm before.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.802
Oh, this can't be good.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.573
So, this is an authentic
Mortal Realm house, huh?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.209
Man, you guys
must laugh all day.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.210
Yeah

11:17.210 --> 11:18.978
light switches,
wallpaper...

11:18.978 --> 11:20.446
my sides hurt
all the time.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.415
There's something
you should know.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.716
You can't use any magic down
here.

11:23.716 --> 11:24.951
You're kidding?

11:24.951 --> 11:26.219
I'm serious.

11:26.219 --> 11:26.986
Hey, it's your world.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.022
I'm just bowling in it.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.090
And these are?

11:31.090 --> 11:32.458
Stairs.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.527
Yeah, I knew that.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.663
But you have to walk down them.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.531
Get out.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.900
Wait here,
I'll grab my bag.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.203
I can handle this.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.137
Whoa!

11:47.674 --> 11:49.576
You can still bowl, right?

11:55.648 --> 11:56.549
Let me get this straight.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.051
You're supposed to roll
the ball down there

11:58.051 --> 12:00.954
and hit all those pins
without using magic?

12:00.954 --> 12:01.854
Yep.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.891
I don't think
it's going to catch on.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.726
So, who're we
meeting here?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.760
My friend Harvey

12:07.760 --> 12:10.163
and his date Jean.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.465
Jean goes to private school.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.600
Probably has
her own credit card.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.168
One of those
Little Miss Perfects.
You know the type.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.437
Yeah, so you two have had your
share of run-ins, huh?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.738
No. We've never met.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.041
Hey, Sabrina.
This is Jean.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.843
It is so nice
to meet you.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.111
And this is Dante.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.446
Hey, cool name.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.414
Jean's awful.
Let's encase her in mud.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.616
No magic.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.184
I don't like
the guy, either.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
Leave them alone.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.754
So, how about I get
everybody a soda?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.756
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:38.258 --> 12:39.759
Walk much?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.595
So I think you have a lot of
choices there.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.664
Look,I have to go. I have to
meet someone.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.498
Your old boyfriend?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.233
No. My therapist.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.202
Now, suffice it to say

12:49.202 --> 12:51.571
that a 450-year-old man
who washes dogs for a living

12:51.571 --> 12:54.474
is not someone you want
to stake your future on.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.775
So enjoy.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.245
On your mark

12:59.245 --> 13:00.880
get set, drool.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.416
Hi. My name is steve.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.284
I'm 35 years old.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.985
I have my Ph.D.
in astronomy.

13:05.985 --> 13:06.452
Loser.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.855
I'm the one looking for a date,
here.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.356
Why don't you wait
in the kitchen?

13:10.356 --> 13:11.257
I'll be quiet.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.659
Out-- now!

13:17.730 --> 13:18.865
Hi.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.733
Uh, I'm Jerry.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.068
Uh, I'm an attorney.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.771
And I guess the best thing
about me is that...

13:24.771 --> 13:28.107
( <i>with Hilda's voice</i> ):
I'm a big fat dweeb.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.643
Hilda!

13:30.910 --> 13:32.578
So it was
our third date

13:32.578 --> 13:35.048
and Harvey took
me to a pizza
eating contest.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.716
Two large pizzas
in 15 minutes

13:36.716 --> 13:37.950
including the crust.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.786
We won second prize--
a free calzone.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.254
To this day,
whenever I burp

13:41.254 --> 13:42.622
it smells
like pepperoni.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.723
Impressive.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.731
I forgot to tell you

13:51.731 --> 13:53.533
his father's in the circus.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.801
I'm Larry

13:54.801 --> 13:56.402
and I'm writing
my dissertation

13:56.402 --> 13:57.870
on the Roman poet
Catullus.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.539
But on weekends

13:59.539 --> 14:01.641
I like to cut loose
with haiku.

14:01.641 --> 14:04.110
He doesn't seem so bad.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.916
A big hello to all
the ladies out there.

14:09.916 --> 14:11.084
The name's Salem

14:11.084 --> 14:13.519
but you can call me Dr. Love.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.521
What are you
doing in there?

14:15.521 --> 14:17.290
Hey, I got wants and needs

14:17.290 --> 14:19.592
that a scratching post
just can't fulfill.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.662
Man, that hologram
makes me look fat!

14:23.930 --> 14:24.630
Hey.

14:24.630 --> 14:25.932
You want me to get
your bowling shoes?

14:25.932 --> 14:27.433
Thanks, that'll be great.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.135
( <i>snaps fingers</i> ):
Don't bother.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.169
I already got her some.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.237
Right.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.171
I didn't realize
you were

14:32.171 --> 14:32.372
such a hardcore
bowler.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.574
Oh, yeah.
I bowl a lot...

14:35.208 --> 14:36.242
at home.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.044
Really?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.413
Well, we better get
our stuff.

14:42.448 --> 14:43.416
Cut it out, would you!

14:43.416 --> 14:43.916
Lighten up.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.718
I'm trying to keep
myself amused.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.053
These mortals are boring.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.654
I'm half mortal, you know!

14:48.654 --> 14:49.756
Really?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.824
You don't look it.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.092
Who's next?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.894
Hi. My name's Ron.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.729
I guess my biggest achievement

14:56.729 --> 14:58.564
is my Nobel Prize in science.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.066
But I'm not a nerd.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.034
I also have one in literature.

15:02.034 --> 15:04.504
And I do have a dark side.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.140
I've got my fair share
of parking tickets.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.808
Ooh!

15:08.808 --> 15:10.376
Sounds dangerous.

15:10.376 --> 15:11.611
This is the guy

15:11.611 --> 15:12.512
for me.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.781
He's smart, attractive
and exciting.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.082
What do you guys think?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.583
BOTH:
Snore.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.989
All right!

15:22.989 --> 15:24.157
Dante, you're up.

15:26.692 --> 15:27.460
( <i>grunts</i> )

15:32.064 --> 15:33.065
Don't worry.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.567
You'll get
the hang of it.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.468
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )

15:37.904 --> 15:38.971
How did you do that?

15:38.971 --> 15:40.873
Just do it the way I did it.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.847
( <i>snaps fingers</i> )

15:51.284 --> 15:52.852
Don't worry.You'll get the hang
of it.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.655
I've never seen
anything like that...

15:55.755 --> 15:57.423
except on <i>The Flintstones.</i>

15:58.891 --> 15:59.792
Oh, flowers?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.194
Champagne?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.728
What did you
bring for Zelda?

16:02.728 --> 16:05.298
I hope your sister's
half as much fun as you.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.899
Half's about right.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.068
Zelda!

16:09.068 --> 16:11.404
Ron's here!

16:12.939 --> 16:14.640
What do you think?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.409
He's cute, funny.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.911
He's a real dear.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.014
I am so sorry.

16:22.448 --> 16:27.220
There's something
very wrong with you.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.956
You're still going
out with him?

16:29.956 --> 16:32.892
Yes. We're going to see
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding.</i>

16:33.025 --> 16:34.193
Had enough?

16:34.193 --> 16:35.995
You couldn't beat me
with three arms.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
That so, huh?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.934
Man, that was weird.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.303
JEAN:
Look at that.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.006
Oh!

16:48.608 --> 16:51.444
I told my dad
these were cheap hats.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.546
Aunt Hilda?

16:53.546 --> 16:55.081
Oh, hi.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.215
I was hungry for some cereal.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.984
Tried to conjure a bowl.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.619
Got to Help me. Dante's out of
control.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.220
He won't stop
using his magic.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.855
Harvey!

17:02.855 --> 17:05.791
Let's see. Have you tried using
a power outage spell?

17:05.791 --> 17:06.859
Oohh,Good idea.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.629
Do you think they serve corn
flakes here?

17:09.629 --> 17:10.930
Best be heading home.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.332
Good thing I wasn't
in the mood for baked Alaska.

17:13.332 --> 17:17.003
<i>Shoot! Man,</i>
<i>is it cold here!</i>

17:17.937 --> 17:19.639
You haven't been nice,
you haven't been cordial

17:19.639 --> 17:22.308
so for the next five minutes
you're going to be mortal.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.444
Hey, you gave me
a power outage.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.882
It's a time-out, mister.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.317
( <i>bowling pins crash</i> )

17:31.317 --> 17:32.685
Whoo!

17:32.685 --> 17:34.954
That makes it 175 to 16.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.489
Want to go double or nothing?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.157
In a sec.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.425
4:58, 4:59...

17:39.425 --> 17:40.726
five minutes!

17:40.726 --> 17:41.761
Spell's over.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.828
It's party time.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.063
Oh, no.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.331
Time for plan B.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.733
Oh, no, there is no plan B.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.138
Your hat's slipping!

17:52.138 --> 17:53.506
Harvey!

17:53.506 --> 17:54.774
Sabrina!

17:56.842 --> 17:59.845
I'm beginning to get
a real feel for this game.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.016
Noooo!

18:04.216 --> 18:05.885
( <i>sighs</i> )

18:06.452 --> 18:07.386
Dante?

18:07.386 --> 18:08.354
What?

18:08.354 --> 18:09.522
Date's over.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.023
Fine. I'm out of here.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.158
What's the point
in hanging out with mortals

18:12.158 --> 18:13.859
if you can't torture them?

18:16.162 --> 18:17.163
Whew!

18:17.163 --> 18:19.031
I am done with hats
for a while.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.132
Where'd Harvey go?

18:20.132 --> 18:21.867
Uh, he went home.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.336
Forgot to feed his fish.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.037
I can't believe
he'd leave me here.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.606
What kind of guy would do that?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.341
We just went over that.
Harvey.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.142
He said he was sorry.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.345
( <i>sighs</i> ):
I thought he really liked me.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.779
Sorry.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.481
Got to go.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.918
Mmm! Hmm!

18:38.918 --> 18:40.653
Cheese. Cheese good.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.088
Mmm!

18:42.221 --> 18:43.189
He seems sort of dumb.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.457
He's a pinhead.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.992
Rock and rubble

18:45.992 --> 18:47.226
thunder and wind

18:47.226 --> 18:48.928
release this poor schlub

18:48.928 --> 18:51.063
from his bowling pin.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.734
How'd I get here?

18:54.734 --> 18:55.601
Whew!

18:55.601 --> 18:56.702
Hi, Sabrina.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.970
Mmm. Hmm.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.505
Cheese good. Mmm.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.941
There's a little
residual pinheadedness.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.042
Harvey,you look tired.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.510
Maybe you
should go home.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.879
Home, hmm.
Yeah.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.318
Sabrina, we have
to apologize.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.286
I'm sorry we set you up
with Dante

19:14.286 --> 19:16.622
that antimortal creep.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.558
He turned out to be nothing
but a big bonehead.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.394
Hey!

19:21.394 --> 19:24.063
And they
say all puns
are bad.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.131
Come on.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.533
I got my school pictures
tomorrow.

19:27.533 --> 19:29.635
Great news-- I finally got a
date.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.170
See? It was just
a matter of time.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005
A third cousin's
okay, right?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.940
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Sure.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.342
Bye.
See ya.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.410
Hey.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.611
Hey! How you doing?

19:38.611 --> 19:39.912
Have you talked
to Jean?

19:39.912 --> 19:42.515
I keep calling, but she
doesn't answer the phone.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.650
What'd I do wrong?

19:46.118 --> 19:47.386
( <i>ringing</i> )

19:47.386 --> 19:48.454
Oh!

19:49.055 --> 19:50.322
Hello?

19:51.257 --> 19:53.459
Harvey, it's for you.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.861
Hello?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.029
Jean?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.264
Harvey?

19:58.264 --> 19:59.598
This is weird.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.967
I don't even remember
dialing the phone.

20:02.301 --> 20:06.105
But... I have been
thinking about you.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.239
Really?

20:07.239 --> 20:08.774
Me, too.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.081
♪ I'll love you this year ♪

20:15.081 --> 20:18.084
♪ I'll love you next year ♪

20:18.084 --> 20:20.019
♪ And then forever... ♪

20:20.019 --> 20:24.223
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.992
♪ I'll always need you ♪

20:26.992 --> 20:29.895
♪ I'll never leave you ♪

20:29.895 --> 20:33.299
♪ I'll love
you forever. ♪

20:34.467 --> 20:35.034
You know

20:35.034 --> 20:38.204
these kind of things
never happen to Peter Tork.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.339
Why are you smiling?
It's a sad song.

20:40.339 --> 20:42.441
Because I have a date.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.043
With who?

20:44.643 --> 20:46.178
Are you ready, love?

20:46.178 --> 20:48.180
Uh, could we go
to a restaurant?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.515
You know, it's
been three days

20:49.515 --> 20:51.584
and nobody's fed me.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.190
Ok we got it,one last time.

20:58.190 --> 21:00.993
After three, this
leg to the left.

21:00.993 --> 21:01.694
Got it.

21:01.694 --> 21:02.695
It's like
line dancing.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.130
You ready?

21:04.130 --> 21:06.732
One, two, three.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.134
Ow!

21:08.134 --> 21:09.201
Oh, sorry.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.437
Do I have to do this
next to her?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.004
That's all right.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.340
We had this problem
with Micky and Mike

21:14.340 --> 21:14.907
but it all worked out.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.242
Are you ready,you ready ladies?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.978
Here we go.
One more time.

21:18.978 --> 21:19.979
Wait a minute.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.413
One thing.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.016
Who's got their
hand on my bum?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.152
That would be me.

21:27.419 --> 21:30.523
One, two, three.

21:30.523 --> 21:31.757
Ready.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.162
I hope none
of my friends
come over.

21:36.262 --> 21:37.263
Can I go home now?
