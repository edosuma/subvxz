<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:03.248 --> 00:04.570
Jesus. What a mess.

00:05.425 --> 00:06.554
Part of it it's good, right?

00:07.026 --> 00:08.417
You told me you
told her everything.

00:08.713 --> 00:10.114
You had to know she'd be hurt.

00:10.489 --> 00:12.882
After I told her
I felt relieved.

00:13.809 --> 00:15.690
I know that your
name is not Don Draper.

00:15.865 --> 00:16.506
Get out!

00:16.730 --> 00:18.705
Mr. Pryce will be taking off
the last two weeks of August

00:18.809 --> 00:19.785
for his son's visit.

00:20.145 --> 00:20.993
So depressing...

00:21.249 --> 00:23.042
I'm this close to
North American Aviation.

00:23.201 --> 00:24.073
Good work.

00:24.306 --> 00:27.315
I'm not sorry, but
I'm married. So are you.

00:27.738 --> 00:28.970
I feel something...

00:29.121 --> 00:30.305
And I know you do.

I need to speak with you.

01:16.378 --> 01:17.912
Away from the neighbors, eh?

01:17.979 --> 01:19.313
Roger.

01:19.381 --> 01:22.650
So... Here we are.

01:22.718 --> 01:25.152
Weeks later, man out of town.

01:26.421 --> 01:27.588
Well, I know you, red.

01:27.656 --> 01:30.091
This is the tenderloin
of your distress.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.026
I'm late.

01:32.094 --> 01:34.829
- What?
- I'm very late.

01:37.366 --> 01:40.901
- Congratulations.
- I thought you should know.

01:40.969 --> 01:43.270
- Me?
- He's been gone for seven weeks.

01:43.338 --> 01:44.505
It can't be his.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.782
- Are you sure?
- There hasn't been anyone else.

01:54.850 --> 01:56.250
No no, are you sure you're...

01:56.318 --> 01:58.185
You know, are you sure
that's what's going on?

01:58.253 --> 02:00.087
Have you had a rabbit test?

02:01.757 --> 02:03.157
I can't go to my doctor.

02:03.225 --> 02:05.092
Hey, look at me.

02:06.728 --> 02:08.996
You're overreacting.

02:09.064 --> 02:10.698
One step at a time.

02:10.765 --> 02:12.266
Let me take care of this.

02:13.435 --> 02:15.069
I'm really sorry.

02:15.137 --> 02:17.905
These things happen, right?

02:19.408 --> 02:21.308
Will you stop being so upset?

02:32.220 --> 02:34.088
Very well then.
I'll wait on your word.

02:34.156 --> 02:36.357
Buck up.
It's gonna be fine.

02:39.461 --> 02:41.061
<i>Get me an
outside line.</i>

02:48.503 --> 02:51.338
- Francis residence.
- It's me. Has Sally left for camp yet?

02:51.406 --> 02:53.474
- No.
- Can I speak with her?

02:53.542 --> 02:57.077
You can try.
Sally, come in here.

02:59.815 --> 03:01.348
Your father is on the phone.

03:02.784 --> 03:04.251
Talk to him.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.924
- Hello.
- I missed you this weekend.

03:09.991 --> 03:12.026
And I have
a big surprise for you.

03:12.093 --> 03:13.093
Can you keep a secret?

03:14.696 --> 03:16.797
Do you think your friends
are going to be jealous

03:16.865 --> 03:18.666
When they find out
that you're going to see the Beatles

03:18.733 --> 03:20.134
On Sunday at Shea stadium?

03:20.202 --> 03:22.470
- What?
- You heard me.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.009
Hello? Sally?

03:29.077 --> 03:31.111
What's going on?

03:31.179 --> 03:33.981
I'm gonna need her Sunday.
We're going to see the Beatles.

03:34.049 --> 03:36.383
Oh. My goodness.

03:36.451 --> 03:39.353
- Sally, say thank you.
- Thank you, daddy.

03:39.421 --> 03:41.655
<i>Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.</i>

03:41.723 --> 03:43.457
You can't be mad at me
if I wear earplugs.

03:43.525 --> 03:45.259
I won't.
I promise.

03:45.327 --> 03:47.361
Okay. See you Sunday.

03:50.031 --> 03:52.399
<i>You have a guest
in reception.</i>

03:52.467 --> 03:54.268
I'm on my way.

04:12.387 --> 04:15.389
Oh. Hello.

04:15.457 --> 04:18.158
Lane, you're looking well.

04:18.226 --> 04:21.962
This is... Unexpected.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.265
Um, have you brought Nigel?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.432
No, I haven't.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.469
Good morning, lane.

04:28.537 --> 04:30.738
That's quite a reception.

04:30.805 --> 04:34.542
John Gibbons, George Casey, this is
Robert Pryce my father.

04:34.609 --> 04:36.110
- Hello.
- Sir.

04:37.779 --> 04:39.914
- Laura will show you inside.
- Pleasure to meet you.

04:41.516 --> 04:42.850
I'm here to bring you home.

04:42.918 --> 04:45.119
This was not the arrangement.

04:45.186 --> 04:47.688
Rebecca doesn't want to see you
unless you're in London.

04:47.756 --> 04:51.292
- But Nigel does.
- I'm here to bring you home.

04:51.359 --> 04:54.261
I'll be at the Warwick until Friday.
That should be ample time.

04:54.329 --> 04:56.397
Well, there's no reason
to stay then.

05:00.769 --> 05:02.970
I suppose we should
at least dine together.

05:03.038 --> 05:06.473
Have you plans
for this evening?

05:06.541 --> 05:08.309
I do now.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.702
I guess we're just a little confused about
what it is we're selling.

05:34.769 --> 05:37.037
Senator Murphy
would be appreciative

05:37.105 --> 05:39.707
If voters were very aware of 
the hundreds of millions of dollars

05:39.774 --> 05:41.542
<i>He's brought
to California.</i>

05:41.610 --> 05:44.078
North American aviation
is a friend of Anaheim.

05:44.145 --> 05:46.113
Pork is only half of it.

05:46.181 --> 05:48.215
The guidance
and control systems

05:48.283 --> 05:49.450
In the minuteman ii

05:49.517 --> 05:51.418
Have significant
civilian potential.

05:51.486 --> 05:54.555
United, t.W.A., American...
they're gonna want this.

05:54.623 --> 05:56.357
So you never have to say
the word "bomb," right?

05:57.726 --> 05:59.293
That's good.

05:59.361 --> 06:01.595
Gentlemen.
Don't get up.

06:03.331 --> 06:06.100
How would you feel about avoiding 
the idea of defense altogether?

06:06.167 --> 06:08.035
If you think that's best.

06:08.103 --> 06:10.270
We'd prefer something
more comprehensive though...

06:10.338 --> 06:11.805
Defense,
cutting-edge technology

06:11.873 --> 06:13.707
And of course the moon.

06:13.775 --> 06:16.977
We've got a 60% bump
in our advertising budget

06:17.045 --> 06:20.514
- To $4 million.
- I assume this means television.

06:20.582 --> 06:22.516
We're taking this
very seriously.

06:22.584 --> 06:25.019
And so are we.

06:25.086 --> 06:27.154
<i>We see this as the beginning
of a new era</i>

06:27.222 --> 06:29.790
In the relationship between
north American aviation

06:29.858 --> 06:31.358
- And sterling Cooper draper Pryce.
- Uh-huh.

06:31.426 --> 06:34.328
There'll be fewer black bars
as the process moves forward.

06:34.396 --> 06:35.462
Gibby.

06:35.530 --> 06:37.031
<i>- Don.
- George.</i>

06:37.098 --> 06:38.599
- Good to see you both again.
- Likewise.

06:40.735 --> 06:43.637
I should get on a plane
to the coast immediately.

06:43.705 --> 06:45.806
Why? I thought we were talking about
"meet the press."

06:45.874 --> 06:48.042
I don't see minuteman missiles
breaking up the "hillbillies."

06:48.109 --> 06:51.111
- I have to go anyway.
- Give me those tickets before you go anywhere.

06:51.179 --> 06:53.647
- Don't worry. They're coming.
- I'm not worried.

06:53.715 --> 06:55.049
Not in the slightest.

06:58.753 --> 07:01.288
My father has come to visit.

07:01.356 --> 07:03.557
I wonder if you might
join us for dinner this evening.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.192
I may have plans.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.494
I'd consider it
a personal favor.

07:38.793 --> 07:41.862
- So how long is your visit?
- Too short.

07:41.930 --> 07:45.265
So, father, how have you found
your accommodations?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.767
Adequate...
sixth floor.

07:46.835 --> 07:48.102
Father likes a view.

07:49.971 --> 07:51.572
I was quite impressed
with your office.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.842
I think the view's better here.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.277
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm your bunny... Judy.

07:57.345 --> 07:58.879
May I see your key please?

07:58.947 --> 08:00.781
Lane Pryce.

08:00.849 --> 08:03.417
Are you the keyholder
or is this a borrowed key?

08:03.485 --> 08:05.018
I am the keyholder.

08:05.086 --> 08:07.554
May I take your
cocktail order, Mr. Pryce?

08:07.622 --> 08:09.690
Three whiskey sours would do.

08:09.758 --> 08:13.694
She's asking what you want,
not how many you've had.

08:13.762 --> 08:15.729
I'll have a nice bourbon.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.966
Whiskey sour sounds good.

08:19.033 --> 08:22.002
And, um, Judy,

08:22.070 --> 08:23.637
Could you see

08:23.705 --> 08:25.606
If that lovely creature
could drop by?

08:27.842 --> 08:29.710
Of course.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.384
So what's your line, Robert?

08:37.452 --> 08:39.986
Carrington surgical,
but I retired.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.855
Father was a salesman.

08:41.923 --> 08:43.724
And therefore no stranger

08:43.792 --> 08:45.726
To places such as these.

08:45.794 --> 08:48.862
Oh, hello. How are
you gentlemen this evening?

08:48.930 --> 08:50.697
Oh, very good, thank you.

08:50.765 --> 08:54.034
Toni, I'd like to introduce you to some
special guests of mine...

08:54.102 --> 08:56.670
My father Robert
and my colleague don.

08:58.439 --> 09:00.974
I tried to get us booked
in your section,

09:01.042 --> 09:03.811
But it seems
you're very popular.

09:03.878 --> 09:05.679
Mr. Pryce.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.485
I hope you gentlemen enjoy
your evening with us

09:11.553 --> 09:12.920
And let me know if there's
anything I can do.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.054
We will.

09:18.793 --> 09:20.160
She's the finest waitress.

09:23.364 --> 09:26.200
I'd be partial to anyone
who brings us our drinks.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.406
Hello, may I help you?

09:32.473 --> 09:33.841
Is this the Francis home?

09:33.908 --> 09:35.976
- It is.
- I'm special Agent Norris

09:36.044 --> 09:37.444
And this is
special Agent Landingham

09:37.512 --> 09:39.112
From the department of defense.

09:39.180 --> 09:41.682
- May we come in?
- What is this regarding?

09:41.749 --> 09:44.451
I promise there's
no reason to be alarmed.

09:57.432 --> 10:00.601
I... well, I don't know
what this is regarding,

10:00.668 --> 10:02.402
But I'm sure you'd rather
speak with my husband

10:02.470 --> 10:03.937
And he's not home, obviously.

10:04.005 --> 10:05.539
We need to speak with you.

10:05.607 --> 10:08.408
Your ex-husband
Donald draper has requested

10:08.476 --> 10:11.144
Security clearance regarding business with
the United States government,

10:11.212 --> 10:14.081
And it's our job
to confirm his application.

10:14.148 --> 10:17.451
- Oh.
- It's a routine background check

10:17.518 --> 10:19.386
So, you see, there's no reason
to be nervous.

10:20.722 --> 10:22.189
No. Of course.

10:26.527 --> 10:28.428
Do you mind
if I get my cigarettes?

10:28.496 --> 10:29.830
Of course not.

10:42.243 --> 10:43.577
<i>So, Mrs. Francis,</i>

10:43.645 --> 10:45.646
You were married to Donald Draper
for how long?

10:45.713 --> 10:48.548
- 11 years.
- And in general

10:48.616 --> 10:50.450
Would you describe him
as a man of integrity?

10:50.518 --> 10:53.954
We divorced.
We obviously had differences.

10:54.022 --> 10:56.223
No, of course.
Do you recall

10:56.291 --> 10:58.058
Any of the magazines
or newspapers

10:58.126 --> 10:59.760
Mr. Draper read
when you were married?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.529
Anything that struck you as radical
or subversive in nature?

11:02.597 --> 11:06.600
No. He read,
but mostly for work.

11:06.668 --> 11:08.835
Did he belong to any clubs
or organizations?

11:11.005 --> 11:12.940
N-n-new York
athletic club.

11:13.007 --> 11:15.042
Would you
describe him as loyal?

11:15.109 --> 11:17.110
Excuse me?

11:17.178 --> 11:19.146
By that we mean
anything that might have

11:19.213 --> 11:22.449
Given you doubts about Mr. Draper's
allegiance to the United States,

11:22.517 --> 11:24.818
<i>Any possible ties or sympathies
to the communist party,</i>

11:24.886 --> 11:27.220
<i>- Or the Soviet Union.
- No, nothing like that.</i>

11:27.288 --> 11:29.156
So do you have
any reason to believe

11:29.223 --> 11:31.692
Mr. Draper isn't
who he says he is?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.894
What was that?
I'm sorry.

11:33.962 --> 11:35.696
It's a standard question.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.130
I know it sounds funny.

11:37.198 --> 11:38.932
No.

11:40.735 --> 11:41.969
<i>It's Mrs. Francis.
Are you in?</i>

11:43.538 --> 11:46.073
I'll take it.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.607
And, Megan, can you check
on those tickets?

11:47.675 --> 11:49.076
<i>Of course.</i>

11:51.879 --> 11:53.847
- Hello.
- I just spent 40 minutes

11:53.915 --> 11:56.383
- With two men from the government.
- What?

11:56.451 --> 11:58.118
Couldn't you have at least
given me some warning?

11:58.186 --> 12:00.020
Betts, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:00.088 --> 12:02.522
Well, you applied
for some security clearance.

12:02.590 --> 12:04.791
They need to know all about you and I've
been through hell, don.

12:04.859 --> 12:07.661
<i>- I'm sick to my stomach.
- Whoa. Hold on.</i>

12:07.729 --> 12:10.263
What exactly happened?

12:10.331 --> 12:12.532
- What?
- Who were they?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.468
Two men from
the defense department,

12:14.535 --> 12:16.636
And they asked me all kinds
of questions about you.

12:16.704 --> 12:21.308
- About what?
- I don't remember everything.

12:21.376 --> 12:24.244
Your military service,
your politics,

12:24.312 --> 12:26.246
Your loyalty, your name.

12:26.314 --> 12:28.148
And what did you say?

12:28.216 --> 12:30.917
What do you think
I said? Nothing.

12:35.223 --> 12:36.690
<i>Hello?
Are you there?</i>

12:36.758 --> 12:38.458
I'm sorry. I, uh...

12:39.761 --> 12:41.128
Jesus.

12:42.563 --> 12:44.498
I didn't know
anything about this.

12:44.565 --> 12:47.234
I don't even know if I should be talking
on the phone.

12:51.172 --> 12:54.307
Of course you should.

12:54.375 --> 12:55.909
There's no problem
with any of that.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.814
You know, my husband works
for the governor.

13:00.882 --> 13:02.416
You should've told me
they were coming.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.584
You're right.

13:04.652 --> 13:06.987
I'm sorry
for inconveniencing you.

13:07.055 --> 13:10.123
Okay.
Well, goodbye then.

13:10.191 --> 13:12.359
- Betty.
- Yes?

13:13.694 --> 13:15.095
Thank you.

13:21.569 --> 13:23.603
Megan, have I been contacted

13:23.671 --> 13:25.038
By the department of defense?

13:25.106 --> 13:26.706
Yes, of course.

13:26.774 --> 13:29.576
There was a form...
I filled it out, you signed it.

13:29.644 --> 13:31.645
- What?
- Two weeks ago.

13:31.712 --> 13:34.448
I have it. Did you want
to change something?

13:34.515 --> 13:36.716
- I never looked at it.
- But you signed it.

13:36.784 --> 13:39.686
- Why didn't you
tell me what it was?
- It's standard information.

13:39.754 --> 13:42.489
It's in your employment records...
just your name,

13:42.557 --> 13:44.524
Social security number,
marital status.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.094
This is very serious, Megan.
I should have been consulted.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.996
We have a contact number. I'm sure you
can change anything you need to.

13:50.064 --> 13:52.966
Oh God, I'm so embarrassed.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.634
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

13:54.702 --> 13:57.037
If you want to fire me,
I'd understand completely.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.908
Is Mr. Campbell
still at lunch?

14:01.976 --> 14:04.244
- Yes.
- Let me know
the minute he returns.

14:21.949 --> 14:23.383
Bye.

14:26.287 --> 14:28.855
- How did you get in here?
- I paid someone.

14:30.291 --> 14:32.225
Nigel didn't come.
He's not coming.

14:32.293 --> 14:34.227
I'm sorry, baby,

14:34.295 --> 14:35.929
But you can't do
what you're doing

14:35.997 --> 14:38.031
And you can't do
what you did last night.

14:38.099 --> 14:40.400
- You're gonna cost me my job.
- No, I know.

14:41.636 --> 14:43.070
I apologize.

14:46.741 --> 14:49.543
You know that I love you,

14:49.610 --> 14:51.378
My chocolate bunny.

14:52.547 --> 14:53.714
Stop it.

14:55.016 --> 14:56.416
I love you too.

14:56.484 --> 14:58.485
I just wanted
father to meet you.

14:58.553 --> 15:01.221
Well, that was
a silly way to do it.

15:01.289 --> 15:03.924
And I don't know why
you're asking for trouble.

15:03.991 --> 15:06.193
No. You're in my life.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.396
I want him to know
why I'm staying.

15:11.065 --> 15:13.467
Why do you have to be
so damn dashing?

15:14.836 --> 15:16.269
I'll ring you.

15:22.310 --> 15:24.311
What kind of man are you?

15:24.379 --> 15:26.513
You've used this woman

15:26.581 --> 15:28.382
And you've ruined her.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.250
Hold on a second.

15:30.318 --> 15:33.987
A man of your age...
only slightly younger than myself...

15:34.055 --> 15:36.656
That you could behave
with such selfishness,

15:36.724 --> 15:38.358
Such irresponsibility.

15:38.426 --> 15:41.928
We came here for your discretion,
not your judgment.

15:41.996 --> 15:43.463
I know why you came here.

15:47.368 --> 15:49.169
There's a good man...

15:49.237 --> 15:52.005
He's not in the city.
He has a practice in Morristown.

15:52.073 --> 15:53.940
It's $400.

15:54.008 --> 15:55.442
Here.

15:56.911 --> 15:58.545
I don't want it
in my handwriting.

16:03.151 --> 16:04.351
Shut the door.

16:13.528 --> 16:16.730
Were you aware that we applied
for a security clearance

16:16.798 --> 16:18.131
To the department of defense?

16:19.467 --> 16:21.001
Did that go through already?

16:21.068 --> 16:22.369
Pete.

16:26.741 --> 16:28.742
They interviewed Betty...

16:28.810 --> 16:30.110
G-men.

16:32.213 --> 16:34.548
- Why did you fill out the form?
- Megan did.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.718
And I signed it without looking,
because that's what I do.

16:38.786 --> 16:40.720
What did Betty say?
You've been fine this long.

16:40.788 --> 16:44.524
There're three lies
in eight questions here.

16:44.592 --> 16:48.128
If they talk to his family...
he was an engineer.

16:48.196 --> 16:49.596
<i>My age is wrong.</i>

16:49.664 --> 16:52.866
Jesus. I didn't
even think about it.

16:54.902 --> 16:56.536
I remember
you mentioned once...

16:58.172 --> 17:00.173
Don't you have a friend there?

17:00.241 --> 17:02.776
And what's he supposed to do?

17:02.844 --> 17:05.512
Stop it. Kill it.
At least find out how far it's gone.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.247
Calm down.

17:07.315 --> 17:08.815
Let me think.

17:10.518 --> 17:13.819
Look, this isn't your problem.

17:13.887 --> 17:15.689
I just want some warning.

17:15.756 --> 17:18.325
Why? What are
you gonna do?

17:18.392 --> 17:20.961
Whatever I have to.

17:21.028 --> 17:22.729
You can run
the agency without me.

17:22.797 --> 17:25.232
Are you kidding me?

17:25.299 --> 17:28.268
I'll look into it...
Immediately, okay?

17:38.112 --> 17:40.280
I hate this.

17:42.817 --> 17:44.117
Not that I would
change anything,

17:44.185 --> 17:45.485
But I hate that it happened.

17:47.288 --> 17:49.289
You know, not the first part
but this.

17:49.357 --> 17:50.690
I understand.

17:50.758 --> 17:52.526
Don't you feel the same way?

17:52.593 --> 17:54.094
I mean, what if this is a sign?

17:57.031 --> 17:59.099
I haven't stopped
thinking about you.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.034
Maybe I'm in love with you.

18:05.206 --> 18:07.073
So you want to keep it?

18:07.141 --> 18:11.711
No, of course not,
but it's just...

18:11.779 --> 18:13.580
I mean, if there's going
to be something between us,

18:13.648 --> 18:15.282
I don't want it
to start this way...

18:15.349 --> 18:17.117
Do you?
... With a scandal?

18:17.184 --> 18:19.052
I see.

18:20.388 --> 18:22.322
But I guess you could keep it.

18:22.390 --> 18:25.325
I mean, when he comes home,
who's gonna know the difference?

18:25.393 --> 18:28.361
Lots of g.I.S came home to a little surprise.
No one did the math.

18:28.429 --> 18:30.530
It wouldn't be my child.

18:30.598 --> 18:32.232
Let's make that clear.

18:32.300 --> 18:35.001
I mean if he comes home.

18:35.069 --> 18:37.103
Jesus.

18:37.171 --> 18:40.373
- Greg dying is not a solution to this.
- Okay okay.

18:40.441 --> 18:42.242
I'm desperate.

18:42.310 --> 18:44.311
I'm just trying to think
of what's best for you.

18:45.746 --> 18:47.647
I'm going to take care of it.

18:47.715 --> 18:49.749
Oh. Well...

18:49.817 --> 18:51.518
Whatever you want.

18:53.521 --> 18:55.622
I'll take care
of it, obviously.

18:55.690 --> 18:58.925
- When?
- Immediately.

18:58.993 --> 19:00.594
And I don't want you to come.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.195
You sure?

19:02.263 --> 19:03.930
At least let me drive you.

19:03.998 --> 19:05.899
We shouldn't be seen together.

19:08.102 --> 19:10.103
I don't need you to come.

19:13.841 --> 19:15.642
Look, I'm sorry
I missed dinner.

19:18.713 --> 19:20.413
It's fine, Henry.
I know that you're working.

19:22.950 --> 19:24.718
Don't say it like that.

19:25.987 --> 19:28.655
I'm just tired.
It's late.

19:44.038 --> 19:45.605
I have to tell you something.

19:48.376 --> 19:51.344
Two men came
from the f.B.I. Today.

19:52.546 --> 19:53.747
What?

19:55.416 --> 19:57.917
They interviewed me
for 45 minutes about don.

19:57.985 --> 19:59.552
Why?

19:59.620 --> 20:02.055
Some kind of
security clearance.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.358
Really?

20:07.028 --> 20:09.329
Well, that's what they do.

20:09.397 --> 20:11.097
Is that what
you're upset about?

20:11.165 --> 20:12.766
Please don't
make me feel silly.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.901
I didn't know if I was
allowed to say anything.

20:14.969 --> 20:17.003
You can always tell me.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.975
And if everything goes
as I hope,

20:22.043 --> 20:25.111
E day you may be talking to those
people on my behalf.

20:25.179 --> 20:27.681
I just wanted you
to know they were here,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.749
Because I don't...

20:32.486 --> 20:34.521
Well, I don't want any secrets.

20:36.123 --> 20:37.390
Okay.

20:44.298 --> 20:46.099
<i>- I've got it.</i>

20:51.005 --> 20:52.839
Take the next one.

20:59.046 --> 21:02.215
- He's looking into it.
- How many people does he have to talk to?

21:02.283 --> 21:05.018
If you're asking if he knows
how to keep a secret,

21:05.086 --> 21:06.853
He works for
the department of defense.

21:06.921 --> 21:10.623
- But he talks to you?
- It's going to be okay.

21:10.691 --> 21:13.159
I was thinking about this and I know
it'll be uncomfortable,

21:13.227 --> 21:14.961
But if we have to,
we can ride it out.

21:15.029 --> 21:17.230
- Are you crazy?
- This many years later?

21:17.298 --> 21:19.132
It must be past
the statute of limitations.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.734
<i>It's desertion.</i>

21:20.801 --> 21:23.236
There's no statute
of limitations.

21:23.304 --> 21:26.306
I thought nobody cared
about these things.

21:26.373 --> 21:28.541
What am I supposed to do?

21:28.609 --> 21:30.477
I don't know.

21:30.544 --> 21:32.045
You've been doing it for years.

21:32.113 --> 21:34.380
I don't have to live
with your shit over my head.

21:38.452 --> 21:41.688
You know, I signed this account after you
disappeared in California.

21:41.756 --> 21:43.690
It's taken three years,
but I've grown it

21:43.758 --> 21:46.226
From cocktails to $4 million.

21:46.293 --> 21:47.827
Get rid of it.

21:55.202 --> 21:57.337
Good morning.
Mr. Keller is here.

21:57.404 --> 21:59.472
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

22:01.575 --> 22:03.676
I appreciate you seeing me
on such short notice.

22:03.744 --> 22:06.179
Well, you said you couldn't
discuss it over the phone,

22:06.247 --> 22:07.881
So I assume it's serious.

22:07.948 --> 22:09.048
Well...

22:10.451 --> 22:12.285
I'm interested in setting up

22:12.353 --> 22:14.354
Some kind of trust for my kids.

22:14.421 --> 22:16.523
Oh. Well,
starting from when?

22:16.590 --> 22:18.391
18 years old?

22:18.459 --> 22:20.593
- 21 years old?
- Now.

22:22.563 --> 22:24.964
And I want it to be the kind of account
their mother can access.

22:27.001 --> 22:29.435
Don, why would
she need anything?

22:29.503 --> 22:31.070
Look...

22:31.138 --> 22:32.739
If circumstances conspire,

22:32.807 --> 22:34.974
She'll know why.

22:36.177 --> 22:37.310
I don't like this.

22:37.378 --> 22:39.179
I don't like this at all.

22:39.246 --> 22:41.381
An emergency meeting and...
I'll be honest...

22:41.448 --> 22:44.250
You seem very edgy.
What's going on?

22:44.318 --> 22:46.886
Nothing. It just ran
through my mind

22:46.954 --> 22:49.389
That maybe I'm not prepared.

22:50.958 --> 22:53.259
I know this
has been hard on you...

22:53.327 --> 22:55.995
The divorce...
but don't go spinning.

22:56.063 --> 22:58.798
Everybody has bad dreams
every once in a while.

22:58.866 --> 23:01.501
The wound is still fresh.
It'll heal in time.

23:01.569 --> 23:05.038
Just... Tell me that you'll do that
and I'll sleep better.

23:06.707 --> 23:09.008
Okay, but I'll tell you...

23:09.076 --> 23:11.511
I don't like hearing
that tone in your voice.

23:11.579 --> 23:13.313
Don't worry.
I'm fine.

23:13.380 --> 23:15.215
Now please tell me

23:15.282 --> 23:18.151
You're shut upping
that girl out there.

23:24.068 --> 23:25.636
<i>Hillary.</i>

23:29.674 --> 23:31.241
Are you sure you don't want me
to come in?

24:12.383 --> 24:13.917
Are you all right?

24:17.088 --> 24:18.488
Yes.

24:18.556 --> 24:20.857
I'm sure I will be in a minute.

24:24.329 --> 24:27.497
She's 17 years old.
What do I say to her?

24:30.468 --> 24:33.470
I had her when I was 15
and I don't regret it,

24:34.739 --> 24:36.640
But she seems so much younger.

24:39.844 --> 24:41.645
She's very beautiful.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.280
Thank you.

24:44.549 --> 24:45.849
She is.

24:50.255 --> 24:51.555
I'm sorry.

24:53.157 --> 24:54.992
There's no one to talk to.

24:55.059 --> 24:57.094
I understand.

24:58.563 --> 25:00.697
Thank you for being so sweet.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.436
How old is your daughter?

25:07.939 --> 25:10.173
I'm sorry.

25:10.241 --> 25:12.276
I shouldn't pry.

25:15.246 --> 25:16.847
15.

25:26.124 --> 25:28.425
<i>Dr. Miller is
here to see you.</i>

25:33.998 --> 25:35.399
Send her in.

25:40.772 --> 25:42.406
I owe you
a phone call, don't I?

25:42.473 --> 25:44.374
Yes you do.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.543
Are you all right?
What happened?

25:46.611 --> 25:49.112
I've been snowed under.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.547
I should've called...
I should've called today.

25:50.615 --> 25:51.915
I have to cancel.

25:53.117 --> 25:54.618
You look sick.

25:56.921 --> 25:59.756
- You have a fever.
- Yeah, I haven't been feeling well.

25:59.824 --> 26:02.859
- Let me take you home.
- I'll be fine.

26:02.927 --> 26:06.029
Come on, get your coat.

26:15.973 --> 26:17.541
This pretty young thing,

26:17.608 --> 26:18.942
She didn't know
which way to turn

26:19.010 --> 26:20.344
With my father
on one end of the hall

26:20.411 --> 26:21.745
And my Uncle on the other.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.047
Should've tried
that move at Gettysburg.

26:24.115 --> 26:26.616
My grandpa fought
in the civil war.

26:26.684 --> 26:29.353
Mmm, really?
Where did he surrender?

26:30.855 --> 26:32.456
He never surrendered.

26:32.523 --> 26:34.591
That man could turn
going to the shitter

26:34.659 --> 26:36.360
Into a parade.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.930
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting this.

26:39.997 --> 26:43.066
- Why would you do that?
- Sometimes a fella's gotta pick up the check.

26:43.134 --> 26:44.868
Since when?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.109
You know that
I like you, Roger.

26:52.176 --> 26:54.311
Hell, you a genuine character.

26:58.082 --> 26:59.850
I'm sorry.

26:59.917 --> 27:01.818
That's the long
and the short of it.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.787
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

27:03.855 --> 27:05.655
It's over.

27:07.191 --> 27:08.558
I'm sorry.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.527
Are you kidding me?

27:16.501 --> 27:18.368
Are you trying to kill me?

27:18.436 --> 27:20.771
Is that your plan?

27:20.838 --> 27:22.939
If you want to put us
through our paces,

27:23.007 --> 27:25.275
We will shake heaven and earth for you.
You know that.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.043
Just tell me
it's for show beforehand

27:27.111 --> 27:29.112
Because I swear
you're going to kill me.

27:29.180 --> 27:32.149
Roger, it wasn't my decision.

27:32.216 --> 27:35.986
Since daddy's...
Incapacitation

27:36.053 --> 27:37.954
The board has been
more aggressive,

27:38.022 --> 27:40.657
And that's never been my bailiwick.
You know that.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.859
But they want
to consolidate everything...

27:42.927 --> 27:44.795
One agency, one rate,

27:44.862 --> 27:47.898
All the ad work,
all the brands.

27:47.965 --> 27:51.034
So fine, let's...
you know what?

27:51.102 --> 27:53.570
Get draper
in a room with them
where do they want to go?

27:53.638 --> 27:55.672
Where do you think?
B.B.D.O.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.741
Do you think you'll get the kind of 
attention you get at Sterling Cooper?

27:57.809 --> 27:59.609
Well, you're not
sterling Cooper anymore.

27:59.677 --> 28:02.145
That's right. We're better
and we're devoted to you.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.548
Oh, hell. I don't want you to think
this is for cause.

28:04.615 --> 28:07.150
There's no reason.
There's nothing you can do,

28:07.218 --> 28:10.420
<i>Nothing you could do.
It's just the way it is.</i>

28:12.290 --> 28:13.957
Wait. This is
not happening.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.393
You just don't end
business with people

28:16.461 --> 28:18.528
After 25 yea...
30 years.

28:18.596 --> 28:20.464
We're family.

28:20.531 --> 28:23.800
I... I invited you
to my daughter's wedding.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.602
I don't know why you didn't get
the invitation.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.103
You should fire your secretary

28:27.171 --> 28:28.672
Is what you should do,
not fire your agency.

28:32.910 --> 28:35.278
We're dead.
You know that.

28:37.615 --> 28:40.450
- The question is when?
- We're gonna call for the files on Monday.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.752
No, you can't do that.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.721
I'm begging you...
you can't do that.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.122
You've gotta give me some time.

28:46.190 --> 28:48.758
I told you, Roger.
It's done.

28:48.826 --> 28:50.594
You're not gonna win
these fellas over.

28:50.661 --> 28:53.163
- Give me 30 days.
- What's that gonna do?

28:53.231 --> 28:56.700
After all the lies I've told for you,
you owe me that!

28:59.937 --> 29:02.172
I don't owe you squat.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.207
You inherited this account.

29:05.409 --> 29:07.310
30 days.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.946
Keep it under your hat.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.516
Give me a chance to get
our affairs in order.

29:15.386 --> 29:16.853
I'm begging you.

29:23.995 --> 29:26.630
Okay. I can do that.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.567
Thank you.

29:44.682 --> 29:45.982
No hard feelings.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.087
- Excuse me.
Yes?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.722
I'm really sorry.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.591
We're looking for the Vernons.

30:27.658 --> 30:29.593
I don't know them.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.362
Is this 110 Waverly?

30:32.430 --> 30:35.966
- No.
- What I tell you?
Sorry about that.

30:43.774 --> 30:46.476
- Are you all right?
- Don't.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.612
I'm gonna get you a glass
of water. Sit down.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.656
Are you all right?

30:59.724 --> 31:01.658
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

31:01.726 --> 31:04.527
Are you in pain?
Is it in your chest?

31:04.595 --> 31:07.030
No, but I can't breathe.

31:13.471 --> 31:16.406
Stop it.
Please, don't touch me.

31:18.142 --> 31:20.577
If there's no pain,
you're not having a heart attack.

31:21.879 --> 31:23.246
You're not a real doctor.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.115
My father has
a heart condition.

31:25.182 --> 31:26.716
I've been through this, okay?

31:28.252 --> 31:29.953
You should go.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.756
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not leaving
you like this.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.800
- Good evening.
- Good evening, father. Do come in.

32:01.637 --> 32:03.905
Father, come with me.

32:03.972 --> 32:05.807
I'd like you to meet someone...

32:05.874 --> 32:07.408
Properly this time.

32:07.476 --> 32:10.712
Toni Charles, this is
my father Robert Pryce.

32:10.779 --> 32:12.980
- How do you do?
- A pleasure to meet you again.

32:13.048 --> 32:16.551
How are you finding the city?
Are you enjoying yourself?

32:16.618 --> 32:20.254
- I am.
- Very well then.

32:20.322 --> 32:22.156
What do you say we all head to dinner
and get acquainted?

32:22.224 --> 32:24.392
As delightful as that sounds,

32:24.460 --> 32:25.893
I'm afraid
I'm traveling tomorrow.

32:25.961 --> 32:27.895
I'm terribly sorry.

32:27.963 --> 32:31.132
Oh. Well,
that's too bad.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.401
But please, go on ahead.

32:33.469 --> 32:35.002
I don't want
to ruin your evening.

32:39.274 --> 32:41.876
Uh, well, of course...

32:41.944 --> 32:43.811
Toni, why don't you
run along ahead

32:43.879 --> 32:46.214
And I'll join you in a bit? Don't want
to lose our reservation.

32:46.281 --> 32:49.317
Well, it was
a pleasure to meet you.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.018
Lane said so many
nice things about you.

32:51.086 --> 32:52.653
Yes.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.032
I'll be right along, darling.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.808
Come along.
Out with it.

33:13.876 --> 33:15.943
I see your face.

33:17.646 --> 33:20.314
Are you more distraught
that I found someone I love

33:20.382 --> 33:23.217
- Or that she's a Negro?
- You're coming home, lane.

33:23.285 --> 33:24.719
I'm afraid I've moved on.

33:34.830 --> 33:38.166
- Ah!
- Put your home in order

33:38.233 --> 33:40.768
Either there or here.

33:40.836 --> 33:42.436
You will not live in between.

33:46.475 --> 33:48.309
Yes sir.

33:48.377 --> 33:50.144
What was that?

33:50.212 --> 33:51.913
Yes sir.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.815
What was that?

33:55.951 --> 33:57.251
Yes sir.

34:22.777 --> 34:25.213
Darling, what's wrong?

34:31.453 --> 34:33.120
I can't tell you.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.456
Peter, look at me.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.494
Is there something
I should know?

34:42.197 --> 34:45.299
Trudy, no.
It's nothing to do with you. Come here.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.043
You should talk to me.

34:57.112 --> 34:58.646
You'll feel better.

35:03.986 --> 35:06.687
How is it that some people just
walk through life,

35:06.755 --> 35:09.957
Dragging their lies with them, destroying
everything they touch?

35:10.025 --> 35:12.526
- Who are you talking about?
- I loathe it.

35:12.594 --> 35:14.595
No one ever knows...

35:16.798 --> 35:18.966
Except the honest people

35:19.034 --> 35:20.601
Who have to pick up the pieces.

35:23.672 --> 35:25.673
I don't know what
you're talking about

35:25.741 --> 35:27.508
And I want to.

35:27.576 --> 35:29.243
No, you don't.

35:30.412 --> 35:32.013
And I don't want you to.

35:33.782 --> 35:35.683
You can tell me anything.

35:37.686 --> 35:39.754
- Ooh.
- What was that?

35:39.821 --> 35:42.256
Huh. Just a kick.

35:42.324 --> 35:43.658
He's turning over.

35:43.725 --> 35:44.725
Feel.

35:49.798 --> 35:53.134
Just remember
everything's good here.

36:08.717 --> 36:11.252
No, we don't go to East Hampton anymore.
We go to Southampton.

36:13.055 --> 36:14.689
It's a rental,
but it's a beaut.

36:16.291 --> 36:19.260
So listen, it's been
wonderful catching up,

36:19.328 --> 36:22.063
But I have to admit I'm calling
for Larry, actually.

36:25.067 --> 36:26.600
What?

36:27.803 --> 36:29.136
No.

36:30.839 --> 36:32.640
God, I'm so sorry to hear that.

36:32.708 --> 36:35.476
When did that happen?

36:35.544 --> 36:38.012
I mean, when did he go?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.147
I mean, what happened?

36:47.356 --> 36:49.790
Oh, Louise,

36:49.858 --> 36:52.526
I'm... I'm so sorry.

36:52.594 --> 36:55.730
I obviously didn't know.
I must've been out of town.

37:04.239 --> 37:06.674
Do you want something
to help you sleep?

37:06.742 --> 37:08.209
I might have a Valium.

37:08.276 --> 37:10.378
Why didn't you
tell me that two hours ago?

37:10.445 --> 37:13.114
I don't know.
I just thought of it.

37:13.181 --> 37:15.049
I never take them.

37:25.861 --> 37:28.195
Thank you for staying.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.700
I don't know what happened.

37:32.768 --> 37:34.869
I think you do.

37:36.538 --> 37:37.838
Those men...

37:39.307 --> 37:41.008
Who did you think they were?

37:41.076 --> 37:44.378
I'm so tired.

37:44.446 --> 37:46.714
Please tell me what's wrong.

37:48.050 --> 37:49.717
It's me.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.055
I'm tired of running.

37:55.624 --> 37:57.425
Running from what?

38:03.265 --> 38:05.132
In Korea I was wounded,

38:07.035 --> 38:09.703
But this other man was killed
and they mixed us up.

38:12.407 --> 38:14.041
And I wanted them to.

38:19.714 --> 38:21.082
And I...

38:22.517 --> 38:25.186
Just kept living...

38:27.122 --> 38:28.722
As him.

38:31.093 --> 38:33.327
Oh my goodness.

38:33.395 --> 38:34.895
Yup.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.201
But now I think that's over.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.571
What happened?

38:43.638 --> 38:46.540
North American aviation
told the government

38:46.608 --> 38:48.042
They need to know who I am.

38:52.781 --> 38:54.748
What are you gonna do?

38:54.816 --> 38:57.251
There's nothing to do.

38:57.319 --> 38:59.553
Well, can't you get a lawyer?

38:59.621 --> 39:02.223
You were a kid.

39:02.290 --> 39:05.526
Turn yourself in, have someone plead
for clemency.

39:05.594 --> 39:08.662
It's not that simple.

39:08.730 --> 39:11.198
There are things you can do.

39:12.968 --> 39:14.468
I shouldn't have told you,

39:16.805 --> 39:19.039
But I'm just so damn tired
of all of it.

39:22.010 --> 39:23.511
Hey.

39:26.314 --> 39:28.249
I'm glad you told me.

39:53.964 --> 39:56.432
I don't want to talk at the office and I 
don't want to talk over the phone.

40:13.684 --> 40:15.051
Come in.

40:26.764 --> 40:27.997
I spoke to Russ

40:29.767 --> 40:31.234
And you haven't been flagged.

40:33.070 --> 40:34.804
And if we end things
with n.A.A.,

40:34.872 --> 40:36.372
The investigation
will stop where it is.

40:38.809 --> 40:40.343
Thank God.

40:40.411 --> 40:43.179
So I walk away from $4 million

40:43.247 --> 40:45.682
And I just keep this
to myself because why?

40:45.749 --> 40:48.418
Because you can't
live in the open?

40:48.485 --> 40:50.853
You don't know any other way.

40:53.190 --> 40:56.392
I come here unannounced and there's 
another thing I don't want to know.

40:57.895 --> 41:00.797
Tell n.A.A. We want
Martin Marietta or Hughes.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.300
And what do I tell
the partners?

41:34.031 --> 41:35.732
I called your house
100 times last night.

41:35.799 --> 41:38.668
I'm fine.
Everything went fine.

41:38.736 --> 41:40.737
Should you even be here?
Should you be on your feet?

41:40.804 --> 41:43.373
Roger.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.408
Oh God.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.076
I wish I could
hold you right now.

41:47.144 --> 41:49.178
It's okay.

41:49.246 --> 41:50.980
I feel good.

41:51.048 --> 41:53.216
Ah.
I feel awful.

41:53.283 --> 41:55.518
We avoided a tragedy.

41:55.586 --> 41:57.053
What?

41:57.121 --> 41:58.755
Oh. Yeah.

42:00.624 --> 42:02.058
We have a partners meeting.

42:02.126 --> 42:04.193
Oh Christ.

42:04.261 --> 42:06.029
Really?

42:07.731 --> 42:10.266
Come on.
Life goes on.

42:12.870 --> 42:14.704
You're so beautiful.

42:26.683 --> 42:28.818
- Gentlemen.
- Morning.

42:41.265 --> 42:44.200
Let me call to order
a meeting of the partners.

42:44.268 --> 42:47.336
- In attendance...
- get on with it.

42:47.404 --> 42:51.207
I don't know how to explain it,
but I have some serious news.

42:53.644 --> 42:55.378
North American aviation
is moving on.

42:58.415 --> 43:00.783
What happened?

43:00.851 --> 43:02.752
There was a misunderstanding.

43:02.820 --> 43:04.954
Some names were left
off of a document.

43:05.022 --> 43:07.223
A general was insulted.

43:07.291 --> 43:10.059
I apologized,
but the damage was done.

43:10.127 --> 43:12.061
Well, that's just great.

43:12.129 --> 43:16.099
- What general?
- Unfortunately this is irreparable

43:16.166 --> 43:17.700
How can that be?

43:20.003 --> 43:22.138
Because I didn't
pay enough attention.

43:22.206 --> 43:24.574
That's your only damn job.

43:24.641 --> 43:27.477
I swear, when I think
what we're trying to do here,

43:27.544 --> 43:31.047
When all you had to do
is hold their hands and jerk 'em off...

43:31.115 --> 43:33.049
Is that so hard to do,
Campbell?

43:35.018 --> 43:37.487
<i>We have to come in here
and have this catastrophe</i>

43:37.554 --> 43:40.089
Dropped into our lap
because you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

43:40.157 --> 43:41.724
- Because you fucking up!
- Hey!

43:41.792 --> 43:44.961
- Roger.
- That's the business we're in...

43:45.028 --> 43:46.762
Accounts come in,
accounts go out.

43:46.830 --> 43:51.033
Roger, I think
you should apologize.

43:54.838 --> 43:57.073
I'm sorry.

44:01.211 --> 44:03.312
I have an announcement.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.414
I'm going to be taking
a leave of absence...

44:05.482 --> 44:07.383
Two weeks, perhaps a month,

44:07.451 --> 44:09.018
To return to London
and tend to my family.

44:10.387 --> 44:12.822
I shall be reachable
by telex and telephone.

44:12.890 --> 44:14.857
I can say with full confidence

44:14.925 --> 44:16.893
That the company
is in a state of stability

44:16.960 --> 44:18.728
Even with this morning's news.

44:18.795 --> 44:21.297
All matters financial

44:21.365 --> 44:23.599
May be referred
to Mrs. Harris.

44:25.569 --> 44:26.903
Very well then.

44:38.682 --> 44:40.716
I'm sorry.

44:40.784 --> 44:42.985
Is there more business?

44:45.789 --> 44:48.591
Shall we go down the current status
of accounts?

44:48.659 --> 44:51.894
Lucky strike?

44:51.962 --> 44:54.230
Vick chemical?

44:54.298 --> 44:55.865
Send her in.

45:01.838 --> 45:04.607
- How are you?
- I didn't expect you to stop by.

45:04.675 --> 45:06.776
Stop it.
I've been worried.

45:09.012 --> 45:11.814
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

45:14.651 --> 45:15.985
Let's get something to eat.

45:17.854 --> 45:20.923
I think I'd better be
on my own tonight.

45:20.991 --> 45:23.025
Why don't we see
each other tomorrow?

45:23.093 --> 45:24.994
Okay.

45:28.332 --> 45:31.500
We'll figure out what to do.
I promise.

45:33.103 --> 45:34.203
We'll see.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.907
<i>- Mr. Draper?</i>

45:42.679 --> 45:44.213
- Saturday night?
- Yes.

45:47.084 --> 45:49.218
Very good then.
You can call me with the details.

45:49.286 --> 45:50.553
Good night.

45:50.621 --> 45:52.121
<i>Good night.</i>

45:54.725 --> 45:56.859
I know I messed
so many things up

45:56.927 --> 46:00.162
And I... well,
I got Mr. Crane to get these sent over.

46:00.230 --> 46:01.731
It's the Beatles tickets.

46:01.798 --> 46:03.733
- I thought you'd want them right away.
- Yes.

46:03.800 --> 46:05.167
Thank you.

46:05.235 --> 46:07.470
You see?
Everything worked out.

46:07.537 --> 46:09.772
Yes.

46:09.840 --> 46:12.141
- Thank you.
- I hope it's okay,

46:12.209 --> 46:15.111
But it's almost 8:00.
Do you need me?

46:15.178 --> 46:16.779
No.
You can go.

46:16.847 --> 46:18.547
Thank you.
