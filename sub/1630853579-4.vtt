WEBVTT

00:06.482 --> 00:08.862
So many creeks down here.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.379
It's so blue.

00:12.068 --> 00:13.827
Is there gold in these creeks
around here?

00:13.862 --> 00:15.655
Yeah, we're in the goldfields.

00:15.689 --> 00:16.862
- Parkers Creek.
- Parkers Creek.

00:16.896 --> 00:19.034
No.

00:19.068 --> 00:21.137
Stop, stop, stop.
We've got to get down there.

00:21.172 --> 00:22.827
What are the odds of that?

00:22.862 --> 00:24.241
We should find some gold
in Parkers Creek.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.448
- My creek.
- Yes.

00:25.482 --> 00:26.689
Yes.

00:26.724 --> 00:27.758
Check it out.

00:27.793 --> 00:29.827
It's not even Parker Creek.

00:29.862 --> 00:32.206
It is Parkers Creek.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.931
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?

00:38.965 --> 00:43.000
If you find some gold here,
that would be amazing.

00:43.034 --> 00:44.793
Do you think
we're on private property?

00:44.827 --> 00:46.379
Oh, did we check?

00:46.413 --> 00:48.172
I don't know, Tyler.
That's part of your job.

00:48.206 --> 00:50.862
Yeah.
No, no.

00:50.896 --> 00:53.793
Searching for gold
in Parkers Creek.

01:00.896 --> 01:02.000
Nothing.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.103
Did he find any?

01:07.137 --> 01:08.310
No joy?

01:08.344 --> 01:09.655
I don't think so.

01:10.758 --> 01:12.379
Nah.

01:12.413 --> 01:13.620
We tried.

01:13.655 --> 01:14.827
The journey continues.

01:14.862 --> 01:16.344
We're also probably
on private property

01:16.379 --> 01:17.724
and I don't feel like
getting shot.

01:17.758 --> 01:19.448
Yeah, good idea.

01:19.482 --> 01:20.896
At least we can tell,
we didn't find anything.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.275
Parker is a bust.

01:22.310 --> 01:23.655
Get out of here.

01:36.344 --> 01:37.586
Hey, how are you?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.310
Yeah, I'm good, good.

01:40.344 --> 01:42.724
Um, thank you
for getting back to me.

01:42.758 --> 01:45.620
<i>Parker Schnabel
is on the hunt for a washplant</i>

01:45.655 --> 01:49.724
<i>for his Alaska operation,</i> <i>
and is leaning on 26-year-old</i>

01:49.758 --> 01:53.103
<i>prospector Tyler Mahoney</i> <i>
to find one.</i>

01:53.137 --> 01:56.896
<i>But two weeks into the trip,</i> <i>
she still hasn't delivered.</i>

01:56.931 --> 01:58.379
We're looking
for washplants for sale,

01:58.413 --> 02:01.000
so I was just hoping that,
um, maybe you wouldn't mind

02:01.034 --> 02:04.034
if we headed up to your site
and checked it out.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.931
Mmm-hmm.

02:05.965 --> 02:07.655
All right.
Yeah, sure.

02:07.689 --> 02:09.206
Yeah.

02:09.241 --> 02:10.310
Cool.
All right.

02:11.793 --> 02:13.241
It looks like
we're a go-ahead.

02:16.517 --> 02:18.689
That one looks fresh.

02:18.724 --> 02:22.137
<i>Two weeks ago</i> <i>
at Iain Whyte's mine</i> <i>
near Hokitika...</i>

02:22.172 --> 02:24.103
I'm liking
what I'm seeing here.

02:24.137 --> 02:26.862
<i>...Parker fell in</i> <i>
love with a brand-new</i> <i>
washplant</i>

02:26.896 --> 02:29.517
<i>with a cutting-edge design.</i>

02:29.551 --> 02:31.551
I really like this plant.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.689
<i>But left empty-handed.</i>

02:33.724 --> 02:37.931
We started talking money
a little bit,
but it's his baby.

02:37.965 --> 02:42.103
This sets a very high standard
for what we're looking for.

02:42.137 --> 02:45.482
<i>Since then, Parker</i> <i>
has seen three more plants...</i>

02:45.517 --> 02:47.103
How old is this unit?

02:47.137 --> 02:49.482
She's, uh, 38 years old.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.655
<i>...but is yet</i> <i>
to find the right one.</i>

02:53.206 --> 02:55.000
It's just not
what we're looking for.

02:57.275 --> 02:58.793
<i>The biggest problem</i> <i>
we've got right now</i>

02:58.827 --> 03:00.344
<i>is we're up against it</i> <i>
for time.</i>

03:00.379 --> 03:03.034
If we don't find
a trommel
to buy that we can move

03:03.068 --> 03:06.034
to Fairbanks in time
that's probably gonna be
as specialized

03:06.068 --> 03:08.793
as I want it,
that's gonna be tough.

03:10.172 --> 03:13.344
<i>Now, with only</i> <i>
five weeks left in country,</i>

03:13.379 --> 03:17.068
<i>it's on Tyler to keep</i> <i>
delivering hard new leads.</i>

03:18.034 --> 03:19.517
Right.
Where are we off to, Ty?

03:19.551 --> 03:22.517
We are going to see
a man called Matt.

03:22.551 --> 03:23.827
Matt Dove.

03:23.862 --> 03:27.172
He's a gold miner up
in this region.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.413
He's running a trommel.

03:28.448 --> 03:29.551
He's got two up there.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.000
One of them is for sale.

03:31.034 --> 03:32.793
So that's why we're heading
off to have a look at it.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.206
<i>After striking out</i> <i>
in Greymouth,</i>

03:37.241 --> 03:41.103
<i>the team drive</i> <i>
175 miles north</i>

03:41.137 --> 03:43.275
<i>to the heart</i> <i>
of the Tasman region</i>

03:43.310 --> 03:45.586
<i>in the foothills</i> <i>
of the Southern Alps.</i>

03:54.620 --> 03:55.931
I can see a trommel.

03:59.034 --> 04:00.689
Another trommel?

04:00.724 --> 04:01.896
No way.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.551
We're here.

04:07.137 --> 04:08.448
All right.

04:15.379 --> 04:17.310
Hello.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.724
Good to see you.
Good to meet you
in person finally.

04:19.758 --> 04:21.068
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.689
- Here's the rest of the crew.
- How are you?

04:22.724 --> 04:24.517
Parker.
Nice to meet you.

04:24.551 --> 04:26.034
Hello, mate.
I'm Danny.

04:26.068 --> 04:29.413
So you guys are obviously
doing a bit of a tiki tour
around the country.

04:29.448 --> 04:31.620
Yeah.
Checking stuff out.

04:31.655 --> 04:35.103
<i>With permits
to over 7,000 acres of ground,</i>

04:35.137 --> 04:39.689
<i>Matt Dove is considered</i> <i>
one of the region's</i> <i>
most successful miners,</i>

04:39.724 --> 04:45.344
<i>in part because he can run</i> <i>
his massive operation</i> <i>
with just three crew members.</i>

04:47.517 --> 04:48.862
Did you grow up
mining?

04:48.896 --> 04:50.482
No, no.

04:50.517 --> 04:53.206
I, um, bought a piece
of property on the West Coast,
five acres on the beach,

04:53.241 --> 04:56.137
and someone told me at the pub
one night that there was gold

04:56.172 --> 04:58.344
under the front fence
at five meters,

04:58.379 --> 05:01.413
so I started digging
around there one summer

05:01.448 --> 05:03.793
and I put the pan in there
and there's hundreds of colors

05:03.827 --> 05:05.655
in the dust, you know?
[bleep], I'm on it.

05:08.310 --> 05:10.103
Went inside and met,
you know?

05:10.137 --> 05:12.655
That's a great...
That's a great origin story.

05:12.689 --> 05:14.413
You got gold fever?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.655
And, um, then
it just led on from there.

05:19.103 --> 05:21.724
Is this the trommel
that you had, um, to show us?

05:21.758 --> 05:22.827
Yeah.

05:22.862 --> 05:24.482
This one's been around
for a while.

05:24.517 --> 05:25.689
Cool.

05:25.724 --> 05:28.137
- It's been a good, reliable screen.
- All right.

05:28.172 --> 05:30.758
Like, conveyer off,
this thing's probably
road legal.

05:30.793 --> 05:32.034
Yeah, it is.

05:32.068 --> 05:33.586
All you have to do is
just take the conveyor off.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.827
You know, with this,
she's skidded straight
on the truck,

05:35.862 --> 05:38.000
and you're off
to the next job, you know?

05:39.241 --> 05:42.413
<i>Big yellow is mobile</i> <i>
and cost efficient.</i>

05:44.482 --> 05:50.068
<i>Its signature features,</i> <i>
a six-foot-wide space</i> <i>
saving sluice run...</i>

05:51.965 --> 05:54.517
<i>and a pivoting</i> <i>
tailings conveyor</i>

05:54.551 --> 05:57.620
<i>which spreads out</i> <i>
waste material</i>

05:57.655 --> 06:00.586
<i>reducing time spent</i> <i>
clearing tailings.</i>

06:03.379 --> 06:07.586
<i>Valued at $100,000,</i> <i>
this one-of-a-kind plant</i>

06:07.620 --> 06:10.965
<i>is well within Parker's</i> <i>
$1,000,000 budget.</i>

06:12.000 --> 06:14.068
This screen
is cheap to run too.

06:14.103 --> 06:17.620
This thing's about 20 bucks
a day, you know, in diesel.

06:17.655 --> 06:19.034
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.724
<i>If we're gonna make</i> <i>
Fairbanks a success,</i>

06:22.758 --> 06:25.241
<i>we've got to take</i> <i>
a New Zealand approach of,</i>

06:25.275 --> 06:28.379
you know,
coming into it smart,
being efficient.

06:28.413 --> 06:33.827
And so guys like Matt
are gonna be really valuable
sources of information.

06:35.310 --> 06:38.344
At, at an initial glance,
I looked at the washplant

06:38.379 --> 06:41.103
and I was just like,"
Oh, this is gonna be
a disaster."

06:41.137 --> 06:42.241
Did you?

06:42.275 --> 06:44.655
Yeah, I mean don't judge
a washplant by its appearance.

06:44.689 --> 06:46.137
It's a good little plant.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.137
The pivoting tailings conveyor
is a nice design.

06:50.793 --> 06:52.827
You know, this washplant might
not look like much,

06:52.862 --> 06:55.413
but one really cool thing
about this is
it's one of the only plants

06:55.448 --> 07:00.413
I've seen that is operational
and road legal
at the same time.

07:00.448 --> 07:03.517
Right?
Because in Fairbanks
we're close to highways.

07:03.551 --> 07:06.965
And if you're moving
on a highway,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.034
you have to be road legal.
Right?

07:09.068 --> 07:13.241
In the Yukon, we put
sluice on a trailer
sideways at 40 feet wide.

07:14.413 --> 07:15.896
You can't do that
in Fairbanks.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.310
So let's, uh,
let's see it in action.

07:21.344 --> 07:23.172
Well, I was wondering
whether Parker would come

07:23.206 --> 07:24.965
and help me dig
a bit of dirt first.

07:27.103 --> 07:28.931
See if there's any
yellow stuff in it.

07:32.551 --> 07:33.965
Could we go
prospecting?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.344
Yeah, that's the plan.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.551
<i>It's a little bit</i> <i>
nervy at the moment,</i>

07:40.586 --> 07:44.620
and, um, it's a bit hard
to know what's going on
in his head.

07:44.655 --> 07:48.724
So in my head, we'd rock up,
we'd see the trommel working

07:48.758 --> 07:51.241
and we'd chat about him
maybe selling it.

07:51.275 --> 07:54.586
<i>But yeah, things, um,</i> <i>
definitely haven't gone</i> <i>
to plan.</i>

07:54.620 --> 07:57.620
<i>So I kind of feel a little bit</i> <i>
awkward/embarrassed</i>

07:57.655 --> 07:59.896
and it's definitely not going
how I thought it would.

08:03.206 --> 08:05.827
We need to find
a washplant
first and foremost.

08:06.758 --> 08:07.896
Yeah.

08:07.931 --> 08:09.965
But I'm always
looking for ground, so...

08:13.034 --> 08:14.310
That'd be awesome.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.379
<i>In any business and the ones</i> <i>
that are looking</i>

08:18.413 --> 08:20.034
<i>at the most opportunities</i> <i>
survive.</i>

08:21.310 --> 08:23.620
Yeah, I'm excited to be here.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.482
Do you have quite
a bit of ground around here?

08:25.517 --> 08:28.034
Yeah, there's about
2,000 or 3,000 hectares

08:28.068 --> 08:29.931
or something we've got
under permit here.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.965
<i>Matt's got</i> <i>
a lot of land here.</i>

08:33.000 --> 08:35.034
<i>In New Zealand the legalities</i> <i>
are quite intense,</i>

08:35.068 --> 08:39.344
so the fact I think
he's got four permits
is really impressive.

08:39.379 --> 08:43.103
He must be finding good gold
if he can afford to run
that many permits at a time.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.482
We're here under
the Southern Alps

08:46.517 --> 08:49.517
and going into a bit of an
exploration project

08:49.551 --> 08:53.827
where the old timers have been
sniffing around 100 years ago,

08:53.862 --> 08:56.793
<i>and some of the ground</i> <i>
that they looked at back</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:58.137
<i>then thought was no good</i>

08:58.172 --> 09:01.448
is actually probably
good ground for mining now.

09:01.482 --> 09:06.586
<i>Gold was discovered</i> <i>
on New Zealand's</i> <i>
South Island in the 1860s.</i>

09:06.620 --> 09:10.344
<i>On their way</i> <i>
to the West Coast,</i> <i>
prospectors passed through</i>

09:10.379 --> 09:14.758
<i>the Tasman region,</i> <i>
but few took the time</i> <i>
to explore.</i>

09:18.586 --> 09:21.655
<i>Located to the northwest</i> <i>
of the Southern Alps,</i>

09:21.689 --> 09:26.448
<i>glacial movements have</i> <i>
littered this landscape</i> <i>
with rich pockets of gold,</i>

09:26.482 --> 09:30.241
<i>and the potential for</i> <i>
gold rich ground looms large.</i>

09:34.793 --> 09:36.482
You've got
a lot of expectation

09:36.517 --> 09:37.758
for this bit of land
we're looking at?

09:37.793 --> 09:40.241
Oh, I wouldn't know
what we're gonna come up with.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.034
That's the whole thrill
of the chase.

09:42.068 --> 09:43.620
That's why we get out of bed
in the morning,

09:43.655 --> 09:45.034
see what sort of treasure
we can find.

09:45.068 --> 09:46.965
- Don't we, Parker?
- Yeah, exactly.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.448
- Spoken like a true miner.
- Yeah.

09:49.482 --> 09:50.896
What do we need to do?

09:50.931 --> 09:53.482
Uh, we need to walk
that digger into the pit,

09:53.517 --> 09:55.758
and you may have to do
a bit of stripping.

09:55.793 --> 09:56.896
- Sweet.
- Yeah?

09:56.931 --> 09:58.275
- All right.
- Perfect.

09:58.310 --> 10:01.241
- Put me to work.
- Okay. Let's get on with it.

10:01.275 --> 10:04.448
<i>The team head</i> <i>
to a five-acre plot</i> <i>
of virgin ground</i>

10:04.482 --> 10:07.482
<i>on the northwest side</i> <i>
of the mine site.</i>

10:07.517 --> 10:10.275
Parker is good.
He's keen. He's young.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.862
He's got a lot of knowledge.

10:11.896 --> 10:18.068
And I think he's somebody
that could add value
to any mining operation.

10:18.103 --> 10:20.724
It's just good to have
another miner to hang out with

10:20.758 --> 10:22.551
and give me a hand on
the digger

10:22.586 --> 10:26.379
and see what it's gonna
come up with today.

10:26.413 --> 10:29.172
And, um, maybe we'll have
a bit of a discussion

10:29.206 --> 10:31.827
about the business side
of things later on.

10:34.379 --> 10:36.310
This is so different
to what I'm used to.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.310
I'm just used to red dirt
and flat.

10:38.344 --> 10:41.103
It's actually quite refreshing
to see some green grass.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.586
<i>It's kind of cool,</i> <i>
you know.</i>

10:47.620 --> 10:51.310
<i>I haven't done too much like</i> <i>
actual exploration</i> <i>
here in New Zealand.</i>

10:51.344 --> 10:55.103
<i>You know, it's like you never</i> <i>
have proper equipment,</i> <i>
so it's just cool.</i>

10:55.137 --> 10:56.655
Looking forward to seeing
what's here.

10:58.344 --> 11:00.724
Did any of us actually
consider any of this?

11:00.758 --> 11:02.896
I think if there's
enough gold,
it's always on the table.

11:04.344 --> 11:08.551
<i>Parker excavates</i> <i>
six feet of overburden.</i>

11:08.586 --> 11:13.551
<i>The goal, run 20 yards of dirt</i> <i>
to see if they've hit</i> <i>
a pastry.</i>

11:17.275 --> 11:18.379
There it is.

11:26.344 --> 11:29.241
All right, Ty,
you can take that
over to the washplant.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.517
Thanks, Parker.

11:42.931 --> 11:46.586
Talk to me about this
as a, as a place to mine.

11:46.620 --> 11:49.965
I mean, the reason
why I jumped
at the chance to spend a day

11:50.000 --> 11:54.034
doing exploration with Matt is
I'm always looking for ground.

11:54.068 --> 11:55.793
I always say I'd go mining anywhere.

11:55.827 --> 11:58.379
It wouldn't take
much of a push to convince me

11:58.413 --> 12:00.275
that this was
a good place to be.

12:00.310 --> 12:01.448
Awesome country.

12:01.482 --> 12:02.724
Cool people.

12:02.758 --> 12:04.068
Super pretty.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.000
Why not?

12:21.034 --> 12:23.137
There's lots to
learn about feeding plants

12:23.172 --> 12:25.689
and moving dirt and stripping.

12:25.724 --> 12:29.172
<i>In New Zealand,</i> <i>
27-year-old Parker Schnabel</i>

12:29.206 --> 12:32.241
<i>has seized on an</i> <i>
unexpected opportunity</i>

12:32.275 --> 12:34.689
<i>and is prospecting</i> <i>
a piece of ground.</i>

12:34.724 --> 12:37.344
We've just been talking about
mining in general

12:37.379 --> 12:40.068
and it's a hard industry
to get into and, um,

12:40.103 --> 12:41.965
to get the permits
is not easy.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.724
You've got to be able
to show that you've got
the financial capability

12:45.758 --> 12:47.965
and you've got the expertise.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.827
<i>Parker excavates pay...</i>

12:51.655 --> 12:53.275
Now that's a cool
little plant.

12:56.068 --> 13:01.034
<i>...while Jeff and Matt</i> <i>
get his two-foot test plant,</i> <i>
little red, up and running.</i>

13:02.862 --> 13:05.241
We're using
the same sort of set up
with the riffles

13:05.275 --> 13:07.310
as what we are on
the big yellow screen.

13:07.344 --> 13:11.241
So we're using expanded metal
and then onto a set
of standards

13:11.275 --> 13:14.000
and then
the hydraulic riffles.

13:14.034 --> 13:17.172
I think it's nice
and simple, small, easy
to move around.

13:17.206 --> 13:19.620
I like how it's got
the grizzly bars up
so it minimizes

13:19.655 --> 13:22.068
the chances of getting
a, a clog.

13:22.103 --> 13:25.620
This is, uh, perfect for
what we're doing here,
that's for sure.

13:25.655 --> 13:28.482
Belt tension is good.
We got oil. We got fuel.

13:28.517 --> 13:31.586
And yeah, just got to get
some water to the plant
and fire it up.

13:31.620 --> 13:35.000
And the next biggest step
is when Tyler comes down
with some pay.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.275
Oh,

13:45.965 --> 13:48.137
Okay, you definitely
don't get this in Kalgoorlie.

13:49.758 --> 13:52.655
There's literally
a herd of cows on the road.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.344
I don't know what to do.

14:02.931 --> 14:04.482
That's gotta be like

14:04.517 --> 14:07.310
three hundred head
of cattle that I've just
got in the way of.

14:09.862 --> 14:13.448
<i>You get a C-minus
on a dump truck so far, Tyler.</i>

14:14.793 --> 14:16.931
Good gals.
They can have it.

14:17.689 --> 14:18.689
Come on.

14:21.172 --> 14:23.000
We don't see that every day.

14:27.827 --> 14:29.241
There she is now.

14:34.896 --> 14:36.137
Yeah, that'd be good.

14:36.965 --> 14:38.551
All right,
we got water.

14:48.896 --> 14:51.034
<i>You better get up</i> <i>
top there, straight away,</i>

14:51.068 --> 14:53.103
<i>'cause it won't take me long</i> <i>
to chew through that.</i>

14:53.137 --> 14:55.379
Yeah, roger.
I'll get a move on, then.

14:59.413 --> 15:01.068
Everything's going
really good right now.

15:01.103 --> 15:02.482
We're running
quite a bit of pay.

15:02.517 --> 15:03.862
We've got a really nice wash.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.862
The, the sluice
runs are running perfect.

15:05.896 --> 15:08.275
And, yeah, the, the,
the riffles aren't clogging up
at all.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.931
How was it down there?

15:18.965 --> 15:20.758
Good.
They've got it up and running.

15:20.793 --> 15:22.862
Um, the trommel's
working perfectly.

15:22.896 --> 15:26.724
<i>Sorry.</i> <i>
We bring down another load</i> <i>
and, and that'll do us.</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:29.482
Hey, Parker, just a heads up.

15:29.517 --> 15:31.344
Matt said this is
the last load.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.482
<i>All right.</i> <i>
You're good to go.</i>

15:38.517 --> 15:40.000
All right, we're done.

15:47.034 --> 15:48.103
Hello.

15:48.137 --> 15:51.000
- How's it going, Parker?
- A'ight.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.620
- This is cute.
- It's working good.

15:53.655 --> 15:55.689
Oh, it's a good-looking
little thing, innit?

15:55.724 --> 15:57.413
Yeah.
Watch yourself.

15:57.448 --> 15:59.482
Well made.

15:59.517 --> 16:02.172
- How's it going?
- Hey. Good.

16:02.206 --> 16:03.793
I like your trommel.

16:03.827 --> 16:06.620
Hell, no lies, little red.

16:06.655 --> 16:10.275
It's a bit more Granity
than I thought, this wash.

16:10.310 --> 16:11.827
It's got
a lot of fines in it.

16:11.862 --> 16:14.068
- Yeah, a lot of fines.
- Yeah.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.448
I have to get
my terminology right.

16:16.482 --> 16:18.103
Pay dirt equals wash.

16:19.482 --> 16:21.551
For testing
you don't use a pan, huh?

16:21.586 --> 16:23.275
You always usually do this?

16:23.310 --> 16:26.551
I'd rather run
20 buckets through here.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.137
- And...
- Right.

16:28.172 --> 16:30.793
...I've always
found panning is a bit hit
and miss, you know? And...

16:30.827 --> 16:32.448
Yeah, I mean,
the bigger the sample,

16:32.482 --> 16:33.931
the more accurate
it's gonna be, right?

16:33.965 --> 16:35.344
Yeah, when,
when you got the toys

16:35.379 --> 16:37.551
for the same pay, you might
as well play with them.

16:38.862 --> 16:40.620
I think this is
the last of it,

16:40.655 --> 16:43.137
then he's gonna shut it down
and then we'll hand it off.

16:43.172 --> 16:45.620
<i>After running 20 yards</i> <i>
of pay...</i>

16:45.655 --> 16:48.724
We'd put that carpet
into that big pan
to start with.

16:48.758 --> 16:49.896
Gotcha.

16:49.931 --> 16:52.620
And then we'll have
a look at that.

16:52.655 --> 16:57.827
<i>Parker needs to decide</i> <i>
if Matt's ground is</i> <i>
rich enough to invest in.</i>

16:59.620 --> 17:01.068
This is the stuff.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.310
Oh, this is
the good stuff.

17:04.103 --> 17:06.517
How many colors
would you want to see?

17:06.551 --> 17:09.137
Oh,
if the full dish.

17:09.172 --> 17:11.620
Silly question.

17:12.965 --> 17:14.275
There's some
gold in here.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.137
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you see that?

17:16.172 --> 17:18.068
Oh, oh, yeah,
getting a bit of color here.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.241
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, that is good.

17:22.103 --> 17:23.689
And that's just
off the top in that.

17:23.724 --> 17:27.310
And that's probably,
what, a 20th of an ounce?

17:27.344 --> 17:28.551
Yeah.

17:28.586 --> 17:30.310
Something like that?

17:30.344 --> 17:32.448
So that'd be an ounce
per 120 yards.

17:35.793 --> 17:40.379
<i>At one ounce per</i> <i>
120 yards, it's a lower</i> <i>
recovery rate</i>

17:40.413 --> 17:42.379
<i>than the one ounce per</i> <i>
100 yards</i>

17:42.413 --> 17:44.724
<i>that Parker averages</i> <i>
in the Yukon.</i>

17:48.965 --> 17:50.965
Is it always
like superfine like that?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.827
Yes.

17:54.862 --> 17:57.068
I mean, uh, it needs
more exploration,

17:57.103 --> 18:00.655
but probably not a ton
of ground that's gonna be
mineable on.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.344
Yeah.

18:07.034 --> 18:08.827
That's too much
pressure on having a plant

18:08.862 --> 18:11.482
that's operational
this summer for Fairbanks.

18:15.241 --> 18:17.137
- Yeah.
- No worries.

18:18.586 --> 18:21.931
One of the side missions
on this trip was

18:21.965 --> 18:25.241
to like meet people
and build contacts.

18:25.275 --> 18:28.586
<i>I really get the feeling</i> <i>
from him that if there's</i> <i>
gold in an area,</i>

18:28.620 --> 18:29.965
<i>he knows how to find it.</i>

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
And contacts like
that are invaluable.

18:34.275 --> 18:36.103
<i>It'll be good</i> <i>
to get back tomorrow,</i>

18:36.137 --> 18:38.172
<i>set the washplant up</i> <i>
and running.</i>

18:38.206 --> 18:40.137
There's some things
that are a bit different
to what Parker's,

18:40.172 --> 18:41.931
um, got running back
in the Yukon, which is,

18:41.965 --> 18:43.551
I think is great 'cause
that's why we're here.

18:43.586 --> 18:45.344
Do you know anywhere
around here we could camp?

18:45.379 --> 18:46.931
Yeah, anywhere really.

18:46.965 --> 18:48.517
- And we won't get shot?
- No, no.

18:48.551 --> 18:50.310
- You'll be all right.
- Thanks, Matt.

19:02.655 --> 19:04.000
Oh, man.

19:04.034 --> 19:05.689
This is a spot.

19:05.724 --> 19:09.689
There's a guy up here
on a bike, Jeff,
go speak to him.

19:09.724 --> 19:11.172
- How's it going?
- Hi, there.

19:11.206 --> 19:13.344
- Hello.
- Yeah, Matt said you would come out.

19:13.379 --> 19:15.206
- Are you the farmer from around here?
- Yeah.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.862
Oh, awesome.
I'm Tyler, by the way.

19:17.896 --> 19:20.000
- This is awesome.
- Wow.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.724
Look at the view.

19:21.758 --> 19:23.206
- Thanks so much.
- Oh, yeah--

19:23.241 --> 19:25.034
- Are those your cows?
- Yeah.

19:25.068 --> 19:27.206
- Hard work farming, innit?
- Yeah.

19:27.241 --> 19:29.379
So is there
anything we need to know?

19:29.413 --> 19:31.206
Yeah, milking
is at 5:00 o'clock.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.482
Was that in exchange for this?

19:35.517 --> 19:38.103
Yeah, a little bit.

19:38.137 --> 19:39.689
I've milked cows before.
I could help.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.862
- Do you know how to do it?
- Yeah-ish.

19:42.896 --> 19:45.137
- I've milked cows.
- Have fun, guys.

19:45.172 --> 19:46.965
- All right, I'll let you know.
- Nice one.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.310
- What was your name?
- Michael.

19:48.344 --> 19:49.931
- Michael. Thanks, Michael.
- Yeah, it's cool.

19:49.965 --> 19:52.689
- All right, man.
- Yeah, thanks, man. See you in the morning.

19:54.379 --> 19:55.586
No.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.517
Then it's not worth
being shown a camping spot.

19:58.551 --> 20:00.551
Like that is
a bad negotiation.

20:00.586 --> 20:03.000
We could have gone
and camped somewhere else.

20:09.206 --> 20:10.275
Good day, guys.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.689
- Really good day.
- Yeah.

20:11.724 --> 20:12.965
Were you
happy with it?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.793
Yeah, it was a really
good day. Matt's awesome.

20:14.827 --> 20:16.275
What's the plan for tomorrow?

20:16.310 --> 20:17.827
I just want to see
this plant run.

20:17.862 --> 20:19.586
And once this plant runs
and, you know,

20:19.620 --> 20:21.241
at least have something
to talk about.

20:21.275 --> 20:23.689
Yeah, we should probe
him about that a bit tomorrow.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.896
Time is kind of
the essence right now.

20:25.931 --> 20:27.448
We're, we're only here
for so long.

20:27.482 --> 20:30.068
Mmm-hmm.
Great.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.655
<i>Tomorrow</i> <i>
we're going to see</i> <i>
Matt's plant.</i>

20:32.689 --> 20:35.000
It's definitely got some
things that are different

20:35.034 --> 20:38.310
and stuff that I haven't seen
around before.

20:38.344 --> 20:41.241
I'm pretty keen
to get my teeth sunk in.

20:41.275 --> 20:43.310
<i>We're up against it</i> <i>
from a time standpoint.</i>

20:45.482 --> 20:47.172
<i>That's the life of a miner.</i>

21:00.793 --> 21:02.172
Right.

21:02.206 --> 21:04.482
- How are we looking there, Jeff?
- Just about packed up.

21:04.517 --> 21:10.034
<i>Parker and his crew</i> <i>
are spending a second day</i> <i>
at Matt Dove's claim...</i>

21:10.068 --> 21:12.586
- You guys ready to rock?
- Yep.

21:12.620 --> 21:16.689
<i>...on a mission</i> <i>
to secure a washplant</i> <i>
for next season.</i>

21:16.724 --> 21:18.689
- All done, Jeff?
- Yeah. All locked up.

21:18.724 --> 21:20.793
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's do it.

21:21.827 --> 21:24.482
<i>But first, they've got</i> <i>
a debt to pay.</i>

21:25.931 --> 21:27.034
Oh.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.793
- There they are.
- Oh, man.

21:28.827 --> 21:30.137
We got to do all these?

21:30.172 --> 21:32.068
- I don't know--
- I hope not.

21:32.103 --> 21:33.172
How's it going?

21:33.206 --> 21:35.103
Good. Good.
You ready to do some work?

21:35.137 --> 21:36.827
I don't know.
I'm nervous about this one.

21:36.862 --> 21:38.724
I've just seen a cow
everywhere.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.689
We'll give it a go
and see what happens.

21:41.724 --> 21:44.068
Oh, my
Holy cow.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.379
That's, that's, uh,
that's, that's quite the view.

21:48.172 --> 21:49.862
Mate, that one's bottom's
twitching a little.

21:49.896 --> 21:51.275
I don't trust that one.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.793
Do you feel like
you're in the danger zone?

21:52.827 --> 21:54.172
I feel like
I'm in the danger zone.

21:55.275 --> 21:57.310
How often do you get
on?

21:57.344 --> 21:59.379
Uh, once a week, maybe.

22:01.413 --> 22:02.793
- All right.
- Yeah.

22:02.827 --> 22:04.379
So that's your
milker device.

22:04.413 --> 22:06.379
You use suction
or something?

22:06.413 --> 22:08.689
Yeah.
Suction and pulsation.

22:08.724 --> 22:10.413
So how do you
turn this on?

22:10.448 --> 22:11.758
Turn it on there.

22:16.689 --> 22:18.551
- Like that?
- Aye.

22:18.586 --> 22:21.172
I thought we were
going to be sitting here,
like pulling udders.

22:21.206 --> 22:22.689
Go on, Ty.

22:23.206 --> 22:24.413
Like this?

22:24.448 --> 22:25.965
Press at that
lever down there.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.620
And it gets the suction down.

22:27.655 --> 22:29.275
How much milk do you
get out from,

22:29.310 --> 22:30.655
from one of these
from one hit?

22:30.689 --> 22:31.896
About seven liters.

22:31.931 --> 22:34.103
- Seven liters each?
- Yeah.

22:34.137 --> 22:36.965
<i>The cows are positioned</i> <i>
on a rotating platform.</i>

22:37.000 --> 22:38.793
Calm down.

22:38.827 --> 22:41.793
<i>So the team have</i> <i>
to work fast to keep up.</i>

22:42.965 --> 22:45.827
- Get in there, Jeff.
- Oh, man.

22:45.862 --> 22:48.172
Try to use your
fingers to fill it.

22:49.137 --> 22:50.620
So you don't put your head
down there.

22:52.586 --> 22:53.862
Oh, this is great.

22:53.896 --> 22:55.551
- Is that right?
- Yeah, this is awesome.

22:55.586 --> 22:57.034
All right, Dan,
you're up.

22:57.068 --> 22:58.965
Uh, yeah,
I guess I'd better.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.344
Tony Beets
grew up on a dairy farm.

23:03.379 --> 23:06.241
I don't, I don't think
they had these things, though.

23:08.379 --> 23:09.724
There you go, Dan.

23:09.758 --> 23:12.172
- There's coming out of that thing.
- Wow.

23:12.206 --> 23:13.655
Oh, wow.

23:14.965 --> 23:16.517
A waterfall.

23:16.551 --> 23:18.206
It's like the firing range, seriously.

23:22.448 --> 23:24.551
This one's fighting me.

23:24.586 --> 23:27.793
<i>Dairy is</i> <i>
one of New Zealand's</i> <i>
biggest industries,</i>

23:27.827 --> 23:32.034
<i>with yearly exports</i> <i>
worth over $11 billion.</i>

23:32.068 --> 23:36.689
<i>Michael's team milked</i> <i>
the 400 strong herd</i> <i>
twice a day</i>

23:36.724 --> 23:40.310
<i>to reach their daily target</i> <i>
of 500 gallons.</i>

23:40.344 --> 23:45.034
<i>Most of it going to make</i> <i>
the best dairy product,</i> <i>
ice cream.</i>

23:46.103 --> 23:47.310
Come on, Jeffy boy.

23:47.344 --> 23:48.655
Come on, Jeff.

23:48.689 --> 23:49.827
Well done, mate.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.586
- Oh, that one don't like it.
- Oh.

23:52.827 --> 23:54.517
- Oh, there you go.
- everywhere.

23:54.551 --> 23:55.862
- Awesome.
- Oh.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.551
That was close.

24:00.586 --> 24:01.965
So is that about it?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.862
You paid for your camping now,
so we're covered.

24:04.896 --> 24:06.310
We're good.

24:06.344 --> 24:09.482
We definitely got
the short end of the stick.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.724
Oh, no,
that was great.
Thank you for that night.

24:11.758 --> 24:14.310
Never thanked
somebody for getting
on the before but...

24:15.896 --> 24:18.344
- There's a first too.
- There's a first for everything.

24:18.379 --> 24:21.379
<i>40 cows expertly milked</i> <i>
by the team...</i>

24:23.206 --> 24:26.241
<i>...Parker turns his</i> <i>
attention to his main goal,</i>

24:26.275 --> 24:28.241
<i>finding a wash plant.</i>

24:28.275 --> 24:32.448
<i>And his sights are set</i> <i>
on testing Matt Dove's</i> <i>
compact trommel.</i>

24:34.620 --> 24:36.862
So mind if we go take a look?

24:36.896 --> 24:39.862
It's got a few
hydraulic issues going on
this morning,

24:39.896 --> 24:42.000
so we're working out a bit
of a bush fix.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.448
Oh,

24:47.448 --> 24:48.827
typical.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.689
Like, of course, this happens.

24:50.724 --> 24:52.448
The whole machine's down.

24:52.482 --> 24:54.310
It's always something
with this business, isn't it?

24:54.344 --> 24:55.724
Oh, yeah.

24:58.448 --> 24:59.724
I mean,
it's been a good,

24:59.758 --> 25:01.758
reliable screen up until
today, really.

25:04.862 --> 25:06.586
How are you guys doing?

25:06.620 --> 25:08.206
You guys figuring out
the problem?

25:08.241 --> 25:11.068
Um, we're gonna
need a little bit longer.

25:15.655 --> 25:16.931
What's happening?

25:16.965 --> 25:19.344
Oh, we replaced
the coupling on the motor...

25:19.379 --> 25:20.551
Oh, yeah.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.379
...and put a new pump
to drive the trommel.

25:22.413 --> 25:24.379
But now we've put it back
together the other pump

25:24.413 --> 25:26.310
that drives the stack
has broken down.

25:29.379 --> 25:30.517
Trommel's
not working.

25:31.517 --> 25:32.931
It needs to work.

25:32.965 --> 25:35.413
We need to be seeing machinery
running or why the hell have

25:35.448 --> 25:39.172
I dragged all the boys
out here to a machine
that doesn't work?

25:42.586 --> 25:44.482
Are you any good at this
sort of stuff, Parker?

25:45.310 --> 25:46.689
No, he is.

25:46.724 --> 25:48.827
- I can understand most of it, but...
- Yeah.

25:48.862 --> 25:50.310
...um, when it comes
to fixing things,

25:50.344 --> 25:52.344
- I'm pretty useless.
- Yeah.

25:52.379 --> 25:54.551
Put Jeff to work.
That's why we brought him.

25:56.724 --> 25:58.103
<i>You know,</i> <i>
a bit of pressure on me.</i>

25:58.137 --> 26:00.068
I, I think he's hoping that
I can get this thing up
and running,

26:00.103 --> 26:02.448
which, yeah, feel little bit
of the pressure.

26:03.793 --> 26:06.137
Having Jeff along gives us
a bit more credibility

26:06.172 --> 26:08.758
and ability to actually
do some stuff.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.758
Normally we come stumbling
and tripping in.

26:10.793 --> 26:12.034
Yeah, exactly.

26:12.068 --> 26:14.000
Leave the place in a mess.

26:18.655 --> 26:20.896
- Oh, is that the problem?
- Yeah.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.344
Right now, when I spin this,

26:22.379 --> 26:24.586
- I'm feeling no resistance in there, so...
- Oh.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.551
...it's definitely
the hydraulic pump
for the conveyor.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.344
Yeah.
Not looking good.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.586
No.

26:29.620 --> 26:31.586
Without this, the conveyor
is not going to turn on.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.103
No.
So what is the hydraulic pump?

26:33.137 --> 26:34.896
What, what, what purp...
What's the purpose of it?

26:34.931 --> 26:36.758
So without
the hydraulic pump running,

26:36.793 --> 26:41.862
it's not supplying hydraulic
fluid up these lines to
the motor

26:41.896 --> 26:43.482
- that you can see there...
- Yeah.

26:43.517 --> 26:45.206
...which turns
the head pulley,

26:45.241 --> 26:46.862
which moves the conveyor belt

26:46.896 --> 26:50.000
and moves the discharge rock
out of the trommel.

26:50.034 --> 26:53.931
Without that happening,
there's gonna be
a massive jam up here.

26:53.965 --> 26:57.620
<i>If the conveyor belt</i> <i>
can't remove rocks</i> <i>
from the trommel,</i>

26:57.655 --> 27:02.896
<i>a machine won't run,</i> <i>
and Parker's trip</i> <i>
to Matt's mine will be over.</i>

27:02.931 --> 27:06.172
<i>It's on Jeff to work out</i> <i>
a bush fix for the pump.</i>

27:07.206 --> 27:09.793
Jeff really needs to deliver
on this,

27:09.827 --> 27:12.827
because if we don't get this
fired up today,
this is a wasted journey.

27:14.862 --> 27:17.241
Do you reckon
we'll get it done
before we get out of here?

27:17.275 --> 27:18.793
I'm gonna try
my hardest to get this done

27:18.827 --> 27:21.275
so we can see this run
'cause we are pressed for time

27:21.310 --> 27:23.724
and we need to see this
before we can go.

27:27.275 --> 27:28.758
Not even sure this is
gonna work,

27:28.793 --> 27:32.137
but we got to go see
if we can get some parts
off this old plant

27:32.172 --> 27:33.793
to get it up and running.

27:33.827 --> 27:35.931
Hopefully we can come up
with something.

27:35.965 --> 27:37.517
Let's have a look.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.931
Oh, I'm liking
what I'm seeing here.
It's gonna be the same.

27:43.965 --> 27:45.827
Let's get this thing off
and get this going here.

27:48.344 --> 27:50.620
Pull her off, get her out,
and get her on.

27:55.103 --> 27:56.275
Got the pump.

27:56.310 --> 27:57.827
We're just gonna
see if this fits.

27:57.862 --> 28:00.275
And if it fits, then we should
be up and running
pretty quick.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.068
Moment of truth.

28:03.620 --> 28:04.896
All right.

28:04.931 --> 28:06.931
Just want to hold that
the other way there.

28:10.034 --> 28:11.793
- She fit?
- Fits perfect.

28:11.827 --> 28:13.379
Now we're just gonna
tighten up these two bolts,

28:13.413 --> 28:15.793
put the lines back up
and fire up

28:15.827 --> 28:17.172
and see if we can
run this conveyor.

28:17.206 --> 28:18.793
Sweet.

28:27.448 --> 28:28.827
- We're all tight.
- Perfect.

28:28.862 --> 28:30.482
- She's on.
- Done.

28:30.517 --> 28:32.137
All right,
bolts are tight.

28:32.172 --> 28:34.586
Let's, uh, fire this thing up,
see if she runs.

28:34.620 --> 28:35.862
Let's do it.

28:38.344 --> 28:39.793
Got her sorted?

28:39.827 --> 28:41.655
- Yeah, hoping so.
- Maybe?

28:41.689 --> 28:42.896
Maybe.

28:42.931 --> 28:44.344
Ninety percent chance.

28:47.758 --> 28:49.103
- Guys, ready?
- Is this it?

28:49.137 --> 28:50.689
- Moment of truth?
- We'res gonna fire it up.

28:50.724 --> 28:52.137
Here we go.

29:09.379 --> 29:11.241
- Guys, ready?
- Is this it? Moment of truth?

29:11.275 --> 29:13.068
- We're gonna fire it up.
- Here we go.

29:13.103 --> 29:14.586
It's gonna work perfect, though.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.310
I can feel it in my bones.

29:26.793 --> 29:28.344
There you go.

29:32.310 --> 29:33.482
Good job.

29:40.517 --> 29:41.724
Oh, yeah.

29:42.517 --> 29:44.103
She works.

29:49.482 --> 29:51.689
- Happy, Jeff?
- Oh, yeah, a happy Jeff.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.068
Sweet.

29:53.103 --> 29:55.103
Just need to feed
the beast now, then.

30:07.448 --> 30:09.931
So what kind of
controls do you guys
run on these?

30:09.965 --> 30:11.827
- CAT.
- Are they CAT controls?

30:11.862 --> 30:13.517
- You want to get in here?
- Yeah.

30:13.551 --> 30:15.517
All right,
I'll hand her over.

30:23.862 --> 30:25.965
She's a weapon,
the old date.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.482
You want a minute?

30:27.517 --> 30:28.896
Just 40 beats.

30:28.931 --> 30:30.275
Just take it easy.

30:30.310 --> 30:32.689
Normally,
with the trommels you can tell

30:32.724 --> 30:36.724
if the rings are dirty
halfway down,
you're feeding it too fast.

30:36.758 --> 30:39.551
You're only really want that
top section running dirty.

30:39.586 --> 30:41.000
- Gotcha.
- Yeah.

30:44.206 --> 30:46.241
Great little plan
to start with

30:46.275 --> 30:48.275
because you haven't got
the side tables.

30:48.310 --> 30:49.793
That's what I was
just telling Dan.

30:49.827 --> 30:52.206
I was like,
"Man, for a lot of the ground
that we're looking at,

30:52.241 --> 30:56.034
it being road legal
and just taking
the stacker off is huge."

30:56.068 --> 30:57.379
Yeah, yeah.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.620
You know, Fairbanks,
there'll have to be
a lot of thought

31:04.655 --> 31:08.655
put into our portability
because if you have to tear
a washplant down

31:08.689 --> 31:11.862
and take days to tear
something down,
to move it from site to site,

31:11.896 --> 31:14.137
it's gonna have
a pretty big effect
on the operation.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.655
One thing I like
about this plant is that
you can, uh, move

31:17.689 --> 31:22.241
and set up in half a day
probably, and that brings
your costs down

31:22.275 --> 31:25.551
because you can move the plant
with just like two people

31:25.586 --> 31:28.551
and, you know,
a plant this size, Matt,

31:28.586 --> 31:32.103
has it kind of turned down at,
you know, 40 yards an hour,

31:32.137 --> 31:35.275
which is probably smaller than
where I'd like to be.

31:35.310 --> 31:38.448
But there's something
to be said for keeping it
small and agile.

31:40.965 --> 31:44.310
<i>Big yellow ticks</i> <i>
the box for maneuverability.</i>

31:46.241 --> 31:48.310
<i>But the biggest question</i> <i>
remains.</i>

31:48.344 --> 31:50.034
<i>Can it catch gold?</i>

31:52.758 --> 31:54.896
He's speeding it nicely.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.517
He is bloody good as a digger.

31:57.551 --> 31:58.758
Oh, yes.

31:58.793 --> 32:00.551
- He knows what he's doing.
- He's a natural.

32:11.448 --> 32:13.068
What are your
thoughts?

32:13.103 --> 32:15.827
Oh, I think
it's a pretty cool,
compact design.

32:15.862 --> 32:18.931
Running at the yardage
they're running at,
I think it's fine for here.

32:18.965 --> 32:20.413
Oh, yeah, definitely.

32:20.448 --> 32:24.034
But I see a few issues Parker
might run into trying to run

32:24.068 --> 32:25.689
a little more material
than they're running here.

32:25.724 --> 32:27.689
I think if Parker is trying
to run, you know,

32:27.724 --> 32:29.172
he's telling me somewhere
in the neighborhood

32:29.206 --> 32:31.827
- of 160 to 180 cubic yards per hour...
- Okay.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.310
...I think in theory,
he's gonna overload
the system.

32:34.344 --> 32:36.275
That is, uh, definitely
one thing to think about.

32:39.172 --> 32:40.793
I don't think any
washplants run like that.

32:40.827 --> 32:43.448
I haven't seen
one with the sluice
running underneath it.

32:43.482 --> 32:45.482
It seems to make sense to me, though.

32:45.517 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

32:47.034 --> 32:49.931
To be honest, it's, uh,
not something we typically
see in the Klondike.

32:49.965 --> 32:52.655
Uh, most, most of the time
you see external sluice runs.

32:52.689 --> 32:56.413
But it looks like well-made
and compact
and do you know what I mean?

32:56.448 --> 33:00.241
Now I've seen some but...
some plants and this looks
like a bag of

33:00.275 --> 33:02.482
- Do you know what I mean?
- This is a very nice plant.

33:02.517 --> 33:05.172
It's built very nice.

33:05.206 --> 33:09.448
Another, uh, big factor is
when you're running
hydraulic riffles,

33:09.482 --> 33:11.586
it comes down to how much
pressure you're running
in here

33:11.620 --> 33:14.137
so you don't get your
riffles packing up too fast,

33:14.172 --> 33:15.758
otherwise you start
losing gold.

33:15.793 --> 33:18.310
- It goes straight over the top.
- Yeah.

33:18.344 --> 33:21.413
You always want your fingers
to kind of sink in
a little bit.

33:21.448 --> 33:22.655
If you apply a little bit
of pressure,

33:22.689 --> 33:25.172
you want them to kind of
go down a little bit.

33:25.206 --> 33:26.551
Yeah, okay.

33:27.896 --> 33:29.206
So far so good.

33:35.344 --> 33:38.724
I would have liked
to have run for our normal
four hours this morning

33:38.758 --> 33:40.689
is what I was trying to do
and I would have showed you

33:40.724 --> 33:44.344
how we rake the table
and wash that
and start off again.

33:44.379 --> 33:48.172
Uh, it makes me feel better
because I think we know

33:48.206 --> 33:50.724
that we're not alone in
all the breakdowns we have.

33:50.758 --> 33:52.344
Oh, yeah.

33:52.379 --> 33:55.689
But anyway, it's 5:00 o'clock
and we're running
and it's time to knock off.

34:00.758 --> 34:02.310
Well, we're
shutting down for the day,

34:02.344 --> 34:04.724
so I'm gonna throw one more
old scoop in here

34:04.758 --> 34:08.241
and hope the boss
doesn't fire me on day one.

34:10.344 --> 34:12.586
Done.

34:16.827 --> 34:19.068
- How was that?
- Good.

34:19.103 --> 34:20.482
Feel like
you're back at work?

34:20.517 --> 34:21.793
Yeah.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.310
But I don't do that
at the mine site.

34:23.344 --> 34:24.517
No, I didn't think so.

34:24.551 --> 34:26.000
I'm a desk jockey.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.586
Got boys for that.

34:30.344 --> 34:33.241
Matt, do you ever
find nuggets or
is it all just fines?

34:33.275 --> 34:37.137
Just...
bulk of the gold
is under three millimeter.

34:37.172 --> 34:39.379
Yeah, okay.

34:39.413 --> 34:42.068
There's a fair bit
on that for the time
we've been running.

34:42.103 --> 34:43.758
Oh, it's good
Parker's here now.

34:43.793 --> 34:45.241
You see, the gold's picked up.

34:47.103 --> 34:49.620
I think that
we've brought you
nothing but bad luck.

34:57.931 --> 34:59.793
<i>After running</i> <i>
for three hours,</i>

34:59.827 --> 35:01.862
<i>it's time for the</i> <i>
moment of truth.</i>

35:05.793 --> 35:07.689
How are we looking there,
Parker?

35:09.310 --> 35:10.862
A little bit of color.

35:24.551 --> 35:26.206
Oh, yeah.

35:26.241 --> 35:27.689
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my.

35:27.724 --> 35:29.310
Oh, yeah,
it looks all right.

35:42.827 --> 35:44.862
This is all
black sand now.

35:44.896 --> 35:47.620
Like, I'm shaking the
of this and I still
can't get it.

35:47.655 --> 35:50.275
Oh, I tell you
what I have got is
a rare earth magnet.

35:50.310 --> 35:54.103
<i>In gold mining,</i> <i>
rare earth magnets are</i> <i>
used to separate</i>

35:54.137 --> 35:59.034
<i>heavy non precious metals</i> <i>
from wash material,</i> <i>
including black sand.</i>

35:59.068 --> 36:00.724
Now that is
a strong magnet.

36:00.758 --> 36:06.206
<i>The black sand in</i> <i>
New Zealand is created by</i> <i>
ancient volcanic activity</i>

36:06.241 --> 36:08.448
<i>and contains</i> <i>
a naturally occurring</i>

36:08.482 --> 36:11.931
<i>iron oxide mineral</i> <i>
called magnetite,</i>

36:11.965 --> 36:14.862
<i>giving the sand its</i> <i>
magnetic quality.</i>

36:14.896 --> 36:17.103
Now you're getting
a better idea with the pan.

36:17.137 --> 36:21.482
Just trying to pull
as much of this
out of it as possible.

36:21.517 --> 36:24.206
Feel it's heaps better now.
It's going to the corner
of the pan.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.379
Nice bit of color.

36:39.620 --> 36:42.103
Purity here
is pretty good too.

36:42.137 --> 36:43.655
Yeah, 96.5.

36:43.689 --> 36:45.793
- 96.
- Wow.

36:45.827 --> 36:47.965
That purity
makes a big difference.

36:50.896 --> 36:54.827
<i>After seeing</i> <i>
Matt's trommel</i> <i>
in action and evidence</i>

36:54.862 --> 36:56.793
<i>that it catches fine gold,</i>

36:58.034 --> 37:00.344
<i>Parker compares</i> <i>
notes with Jeff.</i>

37:04.551 --> 37:06.310
I like these
underhung sluice runs.

37:06.344 --> 37:07.689
It's nice and compact.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.758
Um, it kind of keeps
the sluice run underneath
the system

37:09.793 --> 37:12.413
rather than on the outside,
making it a little bit wider.

37:12.448 --> 37:14.655
I also like the way
this conveyor is.

37:14.689 --> 37:18.586
It's controlled by hydraulics
so that it can turn
a little left to the...

37:18.620 --> 37:20.758
and to the right just to move
your discharge pile

37:20.793 --> 37:22.379
if you don't have time
to move it.

37:22.413 --> 37:25.103
It's a pretty cool feature.

37:25.137 --> 37:28.482
Sluice run width
is gonna be a limiting factor
in something like this, right?

37:28.517 --> 37:29.620
Yeah.

37:29.655 --> 37:30.793
Do you have a tape
on you?

37:30.827 --> 37:32.000
Yeah.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.448
Three feet.

37:39.482 --> 37:42.448
Our big plants have
20 feet of width.

37:42.482 --> 37:44.896
This thing has six.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.758
So it's gonna knock you
down on the yardage for sure.

37:46.793 --> 37:48.620
Yeah, big time.

37:48.655 --> 37:51.724
I was thinking like, can you,
could you widen this out

37:51.758 --> 37:53.379
and still make it easy
to get road legal?

37:53.413 --> 37:54.724
We could do it.

37:54.758 --> 37:56.827
But in doing it,
there's gonna be some things
we'll have to drop

37:56.862 --> 37:59.379
and some things
we'll have to change
to, to make that work.

38:00.931 --> 38:02.896
With running the amount
of yardage you're looking for,

38:02.931 --> 38:05.448
we're gonna
have to do just a bit of
a distribution system.

38:05.482 --> 38:06.931
Gotcha.

38:06.965 --> 38:09.068
The amount of yardage
that Matt's running, uh,

38:09.103 --> 38:11.034
it's perfect for the way
he has it.

38:11.068 --> 38:13.172
Uh, but Parker
is talking about
running quite a bit of, uh,

38:13.206 --> 38:14.724
cubic yards through his plant.

38:14.758 --> 38:16.586
And in order to do that,
we're gonna have to do some

38:16.620 --> 38:18.344
distribution system underneath,

38:18.379 --> 38:22.034
so it's gonna take place of
where the sluice run
is on this one.

38:22.068 --> 38:24.827
<i>To increase the yardage</i> <i>
of big yellow,</i>

38:24.862 --> 38:28.137
<i>Jeff proposes incorporating</i> <i>
a distribution system</i>

38:29.206 --> 38:32.103
<i>and adding a much larger set</i> <i>
of sluice runs.</i>

38:33.482 --> 38:36.896
<i>But this would compromise</i> <i>
its compact design.</i>

38:43.275 --> 38:47.068
And that's something that
for Fairbanks we really
need to consider.

38:47.103 --> 38:50.862
Matt also said this thing
costs $20 a, a day to run.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.379
We burn that in 20 minutes
on our big plants.

39:00.068 --> 39:03.000
All right,
so what do you guys
think of the washplant?

39:03.034 --> 39:05.344
Would that ever be
an option, Parker?

39:05.379 --> 39:11.310
Um... it's older,
but it's also
like classic New Zealand,

39:11.344 --> 39:14.896
super portable, super easy
to move around,
extremely cheap to run.

39:16.551 --> 39:19.172
Jeff, you're the evil genius
when it comes to washplants.

39:19.206 --> 39:22.551
Yeah, I think it's neat just
to see the compactness
of the underhung sluice.

39:22.586 --> 39:24.862
I think my problem
with Matt's plant is

39:24.896 --> 39:28.344
I don't know how you keep
the good parts of it
and scale it up.

39:31.310 --> 39:34.896
How do you double that
and keep all the good bits
in it?

39:36.241 --> 39:38.551
So we're not exactly
where we want to be?

39:38.586 --> 39:39.620
Not necessarily.

39:42.551 --> 39:45.620
So that plant...
we're not buying that?

39:45.655 --> 39:47.137
I don't think so.

39:48.137 --> 39:49.344
Let's go see him.

39:57.275 --> 39:58.862
Thanks a ton for the time.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.758
Really good
learning experience for us.

40:00.793 --> 40:04.724
But for our set ups,
it's just too small.

40:04.758 --> 40:07.034
Yeah, okay.
That's all fine.

40:07.068 --> 40:08.344
I really enjoyed it.

40:08.379 --> 40:11.241
It's been good to have
some likeminded miners.

40:11.275 --> 40:13.172
With what
our mission is

40:13.206 --> 40:15.793
in terms of like looking
at plants that are for sale

40:15.827 --> 40:18.689
and seeing new technology
and different kinds of plants,

40:18.724 --> 40:21.724
is there somebody
or some place
that you'd recommend we go?

40:21.758 --> 40:25.068
Yeah, you just got to
keep heading south
and it'll come your way.

40:25.103 --> 40:26.620
Gotcha.

40:26.655 --> 40:28.482
And we'd be able to see
a bunch of different stuff
happening there, huh?

40:28.517 --> 40:29.827
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:29.862 --> 40:30.965
Cool.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.551
Thanks, man.
It's been a real pleasure.

40:32.586 --> 40:34.965
Well, thanks, Matt.
It was awesome running
little red there. It's good.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.517
Would love to come up
to your workshop sometime.

40:36.551 --> 40:37.689
Yeah, absolutely.
Any time.

40:37.724 --> 40:39.206
And you better
make it up to the Yukon.

40:39.241 --> 40:40.827
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- All right. Good.

40:40.862 --> 40:42.482
- Make it a trip.
- I really appreciate that.

40:42.517 --> 40:44.172
- Nice one.
- Thanks, man.

40:44.206 --> 40:45.517
We'll take
a few days off

40:45.551 --> 40:46.827
and I'll give you
the grand tour.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.137
There you go.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.827
<i>The washplant</i> <i>
I showed Parker</i> <i>
wasn't the perfect match.</i>

40:55.275 --> 40:57.620
<i>The goal after this is</i> <i>
to keep the contacts up,</i>

40:57.655 --> 41:01.172
<i>but also show washplants</i> <i>
that make them both stop</i> <i>
and go,</i>

41:01.206 --> 41:02.482
<i>"This could be the one."</i>

41:05.517 --> 41:07.482
<i>This is a really</i> <i>
good place to come</i>

41:07.517 --> 41:09.482
<i>before starting</i> <i>
a new operation.</i>

41:09.517 --> 41:13.241
Matt Dove was a really
cool guy with a lot of
good ideas.

41:14.965 --> 41:16.827
<i>He's talking about</i> <i>
portable plants</i>

41:16.862 --> 41:19.379
<i>and how to make an operation</i> <i>
work with only three people.</i>

41:19.413 --> 41:21.896
<i>And that's the kind of stuff</i> <i>
that we need to focus on.</i>

41:21.931 --> 41:24.000
And hopefully we can go find
some more washplants

41:24.034 --> 41:26.620
and, uh, hopefully find one
for sale.
