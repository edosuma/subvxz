Look, I know how you can get,
and I'm just telling you
up front.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.258
Oh, you know how I get?

03:13.693 --> 03:14.827
Two more, please.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.464
It wasn't my fault,
is all I'm saying.

03:18.464 --> 03:23.336
Look, I've been working
for you for a while,
mister, and...

03:33.913 --> 03:36.983
-I just want you to know
that I tried.
-I know.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.953
I really, really,
really tried.

-Jade.
-What?

03:48.895 --> 03:53.299
Why is the senator on TV?

03:53.299 --> 03:55.935
-You ever have
one of those days?
-I'm having one right now.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.503
Was the schedule wrong?

03:57.503 --> 03:59.939
No, no.
The schedule's perfect.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.609
Then what happened?

04:02.609 --> 04:05.278
[chuckles] It's actually
kind of a funny story.
You'll laugh when I tell you.

04:05.778 --> 04:06.846
Then tell me.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.915
You ever heard of Sunset Boingo?

04:09.882 --> 04:12.719
No. I used to moonlight there.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.687
I started off as a bartender.

04:14.687 --> 04:19.325
A friend of mine,
good guy, solid man,
he let me sleep on his couch

04:19.325 --> 04:21.661
and I was doing
the whole freeloader thing,

04:21.661 --> 04:24.831
'cause my girlfriend,
she broke up with me.
I forget why.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.899
Something about, like,
"You're not listening,"
or something--

04:26.899 --> 04:29.369
Jade.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.338
-I was in a rush.
-Tell me what happened.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.274
I'm trying to tell you.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.343
So anyway, I was in a rut
and I'm doing
the bartender thing

04:37.343 --> 04:39.412
and then they asked me
if I wanted to be a bouncer.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.948
And at first,
I was like, "Bouncer?"
[scoffs]

04:42.315 --> 04:44.617
I thought that was like
a demotion or something

04:44.617 --> 04:49.389
until I found out
that bouncers make $5,000,
sometimes $6,000 in a weekend.

04:49.389 --> 04:52.992
And I was like,
"Yo, sign me up. Bouncer."

04:52.992 --> 04:56.396
Around this time,
I'm also...

04:56.396 --> 04:58.398
I started fucking
this waitress.

04:58.398 --> 05:02.468
My first night out,
I'm with this other dude Myles,

05:02.468 --> 05:07.073
and-and Myles
was this big guy, huge.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.909
He could bench-press,
like, five of me.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.812
As we started talking,
it became pretty clear

05:12.812 --> 05:14.514
that the waitress
that I was fucking

05:14.514 --> 05:17.417
was the same waitress
he was fucking.

05:17.417 --> 05:21.487
And he was definitely
pretty serious about that,
so, um...

05:22.655 --> 05:25.958
the joking didn't last very long
and neither did the fight.

05:25.958 --> 05:31.998
So you got your ass kicked
by a bouncer at a club
called Sunset Boingo.

05:33.599 --> 05:36.102
-Maybe.
-And why should I care?

05:36.102 --> 05:39.806
Because Myles doesn't work
for Sunset Boingo anymore.

05:39.806 --> 05:44.610
In fact, Myles doesn't even work
in the States anymore.

05:47.780 --> 05:48.881
W.

05:50.049 --> 05:51.584
Yeah.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.820
Yeah, he's now working at W.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.089
Here in London.

05:56.656 --> 05:57.690
Yeah.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.726
And he was there today?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.829
-Oh, yeah.
-And he recognized you.

06:02.829 --> 06:03.996
[exhales]

06:03.996 --> 06:05.398
Actually...

06:05.398 --> 06:07.800
[chuckles] not at first.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.902
What do you mean,
not at first?

06:09.902 --> 06:13.406
Well, I mean,
I was waiting in line
and I was about to get in

06:13.406 --> 06:17.076
and then I see Myles
from Sunset Boingo
and I was like, "Yo!"

06:17.076 --> 06:18.644
So you said something.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.613
[stutters]
I mean, I didn't think

06:20.613 --> 06:23.750
that he would hold a grudge
after all these years.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.718
And he kicked you out.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.087
You know what
the really shitty part is?

06:28.087 --> 06:31.157
I made a good-faith gesture,
a show of friendship.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.993
-Bygones being bygones.
-Hold on. Hold on.

06:35.728 --> 06:40.633
Three years ago,
you pissed off a bouncer
by sleeping with his girlfriend.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.602
Tonight, you ran into
that same bouncer

06:42.602 --> 06:44.003
who didn't recognize you
at first,

06:44.003 --> 06:45.638
but then you made
a show of friendship,

06:45.638 --> 06:47.940
after which he kicked you
out of the place

06:47.940 --> 06:49.709
you were supposed
to set up the shot.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.947
I can't ask you any more
questions tonight, Jade.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.117
Not just because
the clock is ticking,

06:58.117 --> 07:01.821
but I hate being in the field
and I hate asking questions,

07:01.821 --> 07:03.556
'cause it means
I don't have the answers,

07:03.556 --> 07:04.824
and when I don't have
the answers,

07:04.824 --> 07:06.926
it usually means
I'm gonna be away

07:06.926 --> 07:08.895
from the comfort of my armchair
even longer.

07:08.895 --> 07:12.198
So with all due respect,
and I appreciate you
being a lady,

07:12.198 --> 07:16.135
does that just about summarize
every fucking thing
that happened?

07:16.969 --> 07:18.070
[inhales]

07:18.871 --> 07:20.640
Uh...

07:20.640 --> 07:24.210
It's the really short version,
but yeah.

07:24.210 --> 07:28.481
I'm waiting for you
to get to the part
where it isn't your fault.

07:36.923 --> 07:40.026
There's a lot riding
on this tonight, Jade.
I know.

07:40.026 --> 07:44.030
A lot of interested parties.
Many vested interests. You...

07:44.030 --> 07:45.832
You understand what I'm saying?

07:45.832 --> 07:47.033
I know.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.936

07:49.936 --> 07:51.904
No, I'm not upset.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.974
No. People much more
important than me
get to be upset.

Another one for the lady.

07:58.778 --> 08:01.681
You know, I'll have
whatever she's having.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.629
Leandro.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.531
Uh, I'm Calvin.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.466
[Jo] And you are?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.736
I'm...

17:50.736 --> 17:53.705
Oh, it's all right.
Just come and sit down.
No rush.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.308
We're just waiting
for a few others
and then we'll get started.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.588
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.523
Holy shit.

18:11.523 --> 18:12.624
Hey.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.129
Hi. Sorry. [chuckles]
What's your name?

18:17.129 --> 18:19.498
She's not shared yet.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.868
-Oh, right. Well, I'm Ben
and this is Leandro.
-We already did that.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.737
Right.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.606
Um, so,
we're just waiting on...

18:27.606 --> 18:29.374
Naturally.

18:29.374 --> 18:32.478
[sighs] Would it kill them
to be on time for once?

18:33.879 --> 18:37.683
So, yeah, whoever you are,
nice to have you with us.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.518
-I'm Ben.
-You've already said that.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.820
Right. Yeah.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.857
Anyway... [sighs]

18:44.857 --> 18:47.726
So... everyone see the news?

18:48.527 --> 18:50.195
-Hard not to.
-[Ben chuckles]

18:50.195 --> 18:52.164
It's like
Lord of the Flies out there.

18:53.332 --> 18:56.401
Um, how is it like
Lord of the FlieBen?

18:57.169 --> 18:58.637
Hmm?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.239
I said, how is it like
Lord of the Flies?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.608
Like, police everywhere.

19:02.608 --> 19:06.311
I know that's what you meant.
I was just wondering...

19:06.311 --> 19:08.580
I don't understand
how that's like
an island of children

19:08.580 --> 19:10.349
savagely murdering each other.
[chuckles]

19:11.750 --> 19:13.919
Is-- I thought that was--

19:13.919 --> 19:15.487
Was that not Animal Farm?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.622
[Leandro]
You're a fucking idiot.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.491
[Jo] Leo, please, come on.

19:19.491 --> 19:23.862
These meetings
are a place of sharing
and of positivity, safety.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.564
[Leandro]
The meeting ain't started yet.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.168
Oh, yeah. Help yourself.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.839
Anyway, the senator.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.543
-You guys see how they got him?
-Like a sniper shot.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.212
Yeah.
It was a nice shot, too.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.346
[chuckles]

19:41.346 --> 19:45.184
Got something you want
to share with us, Ben?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.719
Well, no. It was a nice shot.
[chuckles]

19:47.719 --> 19:49.721
You can share
if you want to, you know.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.590
We all slip up sometimes.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.796
No, it was a nice shot.
That's all I'm saying.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.665
[gasps]

19:59.665 --> 20:01.333
Oh, you okay?

20:01.333 --> 20:02.668
-Yeah.
-[Jo] Don't worry about that.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.570
[woman] Actually...

20:07.673 --> 20:10.409
Actually, no. Um...

20:10.409 --> 20:14.646
I shouldn't have come here.
I'm so sorry.
This was a mistake.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.248
-[grunts]
-[switchblade opens]

20:16.248 --> 20:17.716
[Jo] Krystal? Krystal.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.252
Who the fuck are you?

20:20.252 --> 20:22.387
I was just...
I was just leaving.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.289
Oh, were you?

20:24.289 --> 20:26.558
That's interesting,
'cause no one
just fucking leaves.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.627
[Ben] Let her go, Krys.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.762
Oh, what a surprise.

20:30.762 --> 20:33.265
Ben's probably gonna try
and fuck you, you know.

20:33.265 --> 20:36.401
[laughing] But I wouldn't
read into it too much,
'cause you know what?

20:36.401 --> 20:39.371
I had to fend him off with
a knife for my first two weeks,
didn't I, Ben?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.340
[woman] You know, I should--

20:41.340 --> 20:44.543
Not in a rapey way.
I mean, more in, like,
a puppy dog kind of way,

20:44.543 --> 20:47.879
and I fucking hate
puppy dogs.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.681
-[woman] Pisces.
-[Krystal] Hmm?

20:49.681 --> 20:50.816
[woman] Pisces.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.818
Say that again?

20:52.818 --> 20:54.620
[panting] Uh-huh.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.022
Pisces.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.860
[Krystal] Maybe you're right
where you should be.

21:02.894 --> 21:06.465
So why don't you stick around...

21:07.432 --> 21:09.268
and tell us why?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.369
Hmm?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.405
That's what I thought.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.709
[Jo] Okay, right.

21:17.709 --> 21:19.978
I think we should
just get started.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.047
-[door closes]
-[Leandro] We're not waiting
on Markus and Jade?

21:22.047 --> 21:24.683
[Jo] No, they'll catch up
when they get here.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.519
Uh, Krystal, could you come
and take a seat, please?

21:28.020 --> 21:29.521
I have a question.

21:29.521 --> 21:30.589
[Jo] Oh?

21:30.589 --> 21:31.957
Okay, Calvin, you go ahead.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.826
[Calvin]
Who called this meeting?

21:36.328 --> 21:38.730
[Jo] Ah, well,
you know how it works.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.734
Not exactly.

21:42.734 --> 21:47.072
But tonight of all nights,
the city the way it is...

21:47.072 --> 21:49.408
[Leandro]
If you're that worried,
why are you here?

21:49.408 --> 21:51.076
Go home, boss.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.779
[Calvin]
I just require clarity.

21:53.779 --> 21:56.648
[Jo] Of course, Calvin.
It's a very valid question,

21:56.648 --> 21:58.884
but why don't we
just table that for now?

21:59.718 --> 22:02.754
Er, and... is everybody ready?

22:02.754 --> 22:06.692
Mmm. Sorry.
It's not quite sweet enough.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.866
Mmm.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.768
-Much better.
-Fucking real?

22:17.102 --> 22:18.437
[Krystal laughs]

22:18.937 --> 22:20.372
[draws chair]

22:20.806 --> 22:21.907
All good now?

22:22.507 --> 22:23.575
Mmm-hmm.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.011
Welcome to KA.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.780
My name is Jo.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.449
[all] Hi, Jo.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.786
We're all here
because we're not all there.

22:36.388 --> 22:39.624
KA is an education
without a graduation.

22:40.759 --> 22:44.463
It's a place
of listening and respect.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.900
We all have
another fumble in us...

22:50.035 --> 22:52.604
but we don't know
if we have another recovery.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.808
We were powerless over killing.

22:57.976 --> 23:00.112
[all]
We were powerless over killing.

23:00.946 --> 23:04.716
Our lives
had become unmanageable.

23:04.716 --> 23:08.887
We came to believe
that a power
greater than ourselves

23:08.887 --> 23:12.391
could restore us to sanity.

23:12.391 --> 23:19.398
We made a decision
to turn our will
over to the care of KA.

23:19.398 --> 23:25.837
We made a searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves,

23:25.837 --> 23:30.075
admitted to ourselves
and to other human beings

23:30.075 --> 23:32.878
the exact nature of our wrongs.

23:33.912 --> 23:38.984
Having had a spiritual awakening
as a result of KA,

23:40.185 --> 23:43.488
we try to carry this message
to other killers,

23:44.156 --> 23:46.625
and to practice these principls

23:46.625 --> 23:48.994
in all our affairs.

23:52.898 --> 23:53.999
Fabulous.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.135
Okay,
who would like to go first?

23:57.135 --> 23:58.203
I will.

23:58.203 --> 24:00.639
[Jo] Ben, the room is yours.

24:00.639 --> 24:03.074
-Thanks. Hi, everyone.
My name is Ben.
-Hello, Ben.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.877
And it has been 284 days
since my last kill.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.712
[door opens]

24:09.080 --> 24:10.682
[siren wailing]

24:22.727 --> 24:24.763
Ben, please continue.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.199
So, there was never
any real doubt

24:27.199 --> 24:29.201
what I'd be doing
after school, I guess.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.909
-'Sup.
-[Leandro] Who the fuck
says that shit?

24:37.909 --> 24:39.010
[Markus] "'Sup."

24:39.578 --> 24:40.679
'Sup, fucker.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.749
Fucking do that again,
I'll smack you hard, man.

24:44.749 --> 24:46.718
-[Markus laughs]
-Promise ya.

24:46.718 --> 24:48.553
Markus,
we've talked about this.

24:48.553 --> 24:51.690
Well, I'm terribly sorry
about that.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.593
Maybe you should try
locking your door.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.529
Martial law going on up there.

25:00.532 --> 25:01.633
Hello, Doctor.

25:02.634 --> 25:03.735
Thank you.

25:04.569 --> 25:05.704
[groans] Sorry.

25:07.739 --> 25:10.242
Okay, Ben. Please continue.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.177
Yeah, Benny boy.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.580
By all means, do continue.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.750
-You done?
-Yeah.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.522
So, I mean, I was a killer
even before I got to boot camp.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.257
I served three tours,
all in the desert,

25:25.257 --> 25:29.561
and I saw
and I did a lot of things
that I'll never forget.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.197
Some things I'm not proud of,

25:32.197 --> 25:33.965
maybe even most of them.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.167
My first kill wasn't there.

25:36.167 --> 25:39.671
My first kill
was out in the woods
behind my best friend's house.

25:40.972 --> 25:43.675
I'd smelt gunpowder
100 times before,

25:43.675 --> 25:45.911
but it seemed
so much stronger that day.

25:47.078 --> 25:50.148
Poured up into my nose,
into my brain,

25:50.148 --> 25:52.050
stayed with me for days.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.987
For weeks,
I had flashbacks, like a...

25:55.987 --> 25:58.256
almost like a dream
you keep coming back to.

25:58.256 --> 25:59.724
[Markus] Fuck off.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.826
A hunting accident.

26:01.826 --> 26:05.263
You lost your cherry
on a fucking hunting accident.

26:05.263 --> 26:07.899
Jesus Christ.
Who is this guy?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.302
Markus.

26:17.609 --> 26:18.777
Fuck off.

26:18.777 --> 26:22.981
I'll break your fucking jaw,
you little weaselly bastard.

26:22.981 --> 26:26.818
[Jo] Markus,
if you can't contribute
in a more constructive way,

26:26.818 --> 26:29.087
then you're going to be banned
from the meetings.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.022
[Markus] Don't try to tell me

26:31.022 --> 26:33.058
you don't know what's going down
up in those fucking streets.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.360
You've got the city's best
and brightest professionals

26:35.360 --> 26:37.996
all down here in this fucking
dodgy basement with--

26:37.996 --> 26:39.931
Who the fuck are you,
for a start?

26:41.199 --> 26:43.335
A whole city didn't take down
that senator.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.971
Come on.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.106
-I smell fucking shite in here.
-[Jo] Okay. All right.

26:48.807 --> 26:51.042
Ben, please. Carry on.

26:51.042 --> 26:54.913
-[Ben]
Well, it wasn't an accident.
-[Markus] Prick.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.248
-[gunshot]
-[Ben] I'd never had
a person there,

26:57.248 --> 27:00.685
a human, at the other end
of my scope before.

27:00.685 --> 27:03.655
I mean, he was my best friend,
for Christ's sake.
I knew it was wrong.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.256
It was the wrongest thing
I'd ever done.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.927
But it didn't feel wrong.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.262
[Jo] What did it feel like?

27:12.964 --> 27:14.332
[BeLike waking up.

27:14.332 --> 27:15.700
[Calvin] Why did you do it?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.237
I couldn't tell you.

27:19.237 --> 27:22.107
-[Leandro] What did you do
with the body?
-I buried it.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.942
Not because I was worried
about getting caught.

27:23.942 --> 27:26.277
Honestly, I waited for weeks
for the police to show up,

27:26.277 --> 27:28.313
but no one ever came.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.816
[chuckles] I even thought about
what it would be like
to go to prison.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.387
[Markus] Oh, my God.
They would fucking love you
in prison, wouldn't they?

27:35.387 --> 27:38.990
[Ben]
Anyway, so I even got excited

27:38.990 --> 27:41.359
about the idea
of killing again.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.128
I wanted to share.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.963
[Calvin] Then why bury him?

27:44.963 --> 27:48.767
Sounds s-stupid.

27:48.767 --> 27:49.868
[Jo] It's okay.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.139
[BeI wanted to thank him.

27:54.139 --> 27:58.710
[laughs] For fuck's sake.
Ben, come on.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.345
Seriously,
what is she even doing here?

28:00.345 --> 28:01.946
Come on,
the kid's a fucking pussy.

28:01.946 --> 28:04.916
[Jo] Krystal, please engage.

28:04.916 --> 28:08.253
[Ben]
Anyway, after that, I enlisted.
I lived for that kill shot.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.255
Problem is,
you do that long enough,

28:10.255 --> 28:12.090
you forget how to live
for anything else.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.861
They made me very good
at one thing.

28:16.861 --> 28:21.099
When the tour came to an end,
they told me to go home,
put it away.

28:25.336 --> 28:28.707
So I got this fucking itch.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.143
It's with me every day.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.980
Some days I don't scratch it
and some days...

28:38.049 --> 28:39.150
some days, I do.

28:39.150 --> 28:43.388
Okay. All right, guys.
Thank you, Ben, for sharing.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.924
[all] Thank you, Ben.

28:45.924 --> 28:48.193
[Jo] That was-- Yes, Markus?

28:50.962 --> 28:52.464
Who the fuck is she?

28:53.498 --> 28:55.433
[sighs]

28:55.433 --> 28:58.937
[Jo] Well, I suggest
we take ten minutes
and collect our thoughts

28:58.937 --> 29:00.972
and hopefully we'll find out
when we come back.

29:00.972 --> 29:03.942
-[man yawns]
-[Markus] Would anybody
like some coffee?

29:03.942 --> 29:05.410
[Leandro] I'm going for a cig.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.045
[Krystal] I can't wait
to hear her story.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.780
[Markus]
Yeah, that'll be interesting.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.348
[eerie music]

29:14.886 --> 29:16.154
[Leandro] You having one?

29:17.489 --> 29:18.823
Sure.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.995
-Character, isn't she?
-Who?

29:25.964 --> 29:27.065
Krystal.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.068
I saw you
looking at her in there.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.471
Can't figure out
what you were thinking.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.074
Kinda looked like
she amused ya.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.442
[lighter flicks]

29:37.442 --> 29:39.978
She just reminds me
of someone I know.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.079
Yeah?

29:43.014 --> 29:44.516
You don't strike me
as the kind to get close

29:44.516 --> 29:46.351
to people
who are batshit crazy.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.124
I'm here, aren't I?

29:54.125 --> 29:55.260
My point.

29:57.929 --> 29:59.898
So what do you think
about everyone else?

30:03.868 --> 30:06.204
I don't really know
what to think.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.072
We're all batshit crazy.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.041
You should've left
when you had the chance.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.443
Thought definitely
crossed my mind.

30:12.443 --> 30:17.816
Two failed attempts to take out
that fucking senator
in one night.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.818
It's a fucking embarrassment.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.853
Well, what the hell happened?

30:22.554 --> 30:25.924
Shouldn't I be the one
asking you that?

30:25.924 --> 30:27.458
Let me call you back.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.928
Don't even think about
hanging up on me, Jo.

30:30.461 --> 30:33.031
Jo. Jo. Don't you fucking...

30:33.031 --> 30:34.532
[replaces receiver]

30:34.532 --> 30:36.000
[thunder rumbles]

30:39.037 --> 30:40.138
Any minute now.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.208
Excuse me?

30:43.208 --> 30:45.543
The rain, I can feel it.
It's close.

30:48.079 --> 30:49.180
Yeah.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.384
You'll feel better
if you share, you know.

30:53.384 --> 30:54.886
Share what?

30:54.886 --> 30:57.422
In the meeting.
Share your story.

30:57.422 --> 30:59.224
Might not fix it,
but it'll help.

31:00.925 --> 31:03.061
Like when you do a cry
and you finally let it out.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.500
Please don't tell anybody
I said that.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.136
Your secret's safe here.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.539
[helicopter passes]

31:43.601 --> 31:45.236
[siren wailing]

31:45.236 --> 31:46.905
-[thunder rumbles]
-[gasps]

31:46.905 --> 31:48.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Careful. Careful. Careful.

31:53.444 --> 31:54.545
Thanks.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.314
Yeah.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.617
The way you're holding on
to that rail,

31:59.617 --> 32:01.286
I'd think
you were afraid of heights.

32:01.286 --> 32:02.487
I'm terrified.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.122
-[laughing]
-I really am.

32:07.525 --> 32:09.093
Look, I'm sorry.
This is just...

32:10.161 --> 32:13.064
This has just been
a really crazy night for me.

32:13.064 --> 32:14.565
It's a crazy night
for everyone.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.704
It's not every day
a candidate for president
gets assassinated, is it?

32:19.704 --> 32:21.572
Here we go.

32:21.572 --> 32:24.175
I guess it's not a good night
to be a bad guy, then.

32:24.175 --> 32:27.145
Do let me know
when there is a great night
to be a bad guy, please.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.514
If you share,
you'll feel better. Trust me.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.651
Yep, any minute now.

33:10.221 --> 33:11.389
-Hmm.
-[door closes]

33:17.028 --> 33:18.229
[rattling]

33:28.373 --> 33:29.607
-[squeaking]
-[Jo squeals]

33:37.482 --> 33:40.151
[exhales] Okay.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.623
It's just a rat.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.528
Okay.

33:53.498 --> 33:54.599
Okay.

33:55.666 --> 33:58.436
Yeah, okay.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.506
Geez.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.673
There. Okay.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.809
[exhales]

34:06.310 --> 34:08.413
[indistinct chattering]

34:41.411 --> 34:45.283
Okay. So I think
that's everyone here again.

34:45.283 --> 34:48.485
Um, Ben, thank you very much.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.590
Right, then,
who would like to go next?

35:14.846 --> 35:16.214
[coins clink]

35:22.186 --> 35:23.588
[jukebox whirring]

35:25.323 --> 35:27.125
[music playing]

35:40.738 --> 35:43.808
My name is Calvin
and I am a killer.

35:44.609 --> 35:45.810
[Jo] Hello, Calvin.

35:48.446 --> 35:52.483
Many years ago,
when I was a young man,

35:52.483 --> 35:55.920
my wife and I were involved
in a car accident.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.622
-[tires screech]
-[crash]

35:57.622 --> 36:00.324
I was trapped
in the seat beside her.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.861
I had to watch her die.

36:05.763 --> 36:06.864
It was...

36:08.533 --> 36:09.634
beautiful.

36:17.341 --> 36:21.746
To date,
I have lost 34 patients,

36:22.446 --> 36:24.315
not to illness or trauma,

36:25.516 --> 36:29.187
but for the simple reason
that I wanted to watch them die.

36:31.222 --> 36:33.391
I do not walk around
killing people.

36:34.325 --> 36:36.194
I do not get paid to do it.

36:37.762 --> 36:39.197
I am a doctor.

36:39.931 --> 36:43.768
I have an oath
that I'm sworn to uphold.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.838
"Do no harm."

36:50.408 --> 36:54.312
Sometimes you have to do harm
in order to do good.

36:54.312 --> 36:57.481
Sometimes you have to
cut off a limb
in order to save the body.

36:59.483 --> 37:03.654
So that we might
witness the transition.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.358
Transition?

37:09.293 --> 37:12.230
The transition to the inert.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.665
[machine beeping]

37:14.665 --> 37:18.402
The reminder
that we are all elemental.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.739
The stuff of supernovas.

37:21.739 --> 37:25.910
And there is something
that cannot be found
in a periodic table.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.312
Something
that makes us different

37:28.312 --> 37:31.482
from the other 99.999 percent
of the universe.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.817
[monitor flatlining]

37:32.817 --> 37:34.852
Something that makes us...

37:35.853 --> 37:36.988
alive.

37:48.499 --> 37:49.634
[clears throat]

37:53.304 --> 37:54.405
What I do,

37:55.373 --> 37:57.008
what I allow to happen,

37:58.342 --> 38:01.579
is my way
of conquering that fear.

38:05.316 --> 38:06.651
Thank you, Calvin.

38:07.518 --> 38:09.520
[all] Thank you, Calvin.

38:09.520 --> 38:14.558
Okay. Next, I would like
to try something,
if no one objects.

38:14.558 --> 38:16.060
Um, an exercise.

38:17.061 --> 38:20.531
Perhaps something
that might help us

38:20.531 --> 38:24.302
deal with the everyday stresses
we all face.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.736
I'd like to hear about...

38:26.671 --> 38:28.372
the last time...

38:29.040 --> 38:32.410
you thought about
killing someone.

38:40.518 --> 38:41.619
Right, I'll go.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.488
I'm Leo and I'm a killer.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.090
[all] Hello, Leo.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.826
It was this morning,
the shop down the road from me.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.795
I've got a soy milk maker.

38:50.795 --> 38:52.963
-So once a week,
I go and restock.
-A what?

38:54.065 --> 38:57.101
A soy milk maker.
I make me own soy milk.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.506
Why?

39:02.506 --> 39:04.608
Because it's a healthier
alternative to lactose

39:04.608 --> 39:06.711
and it's easier
and quicker to make
than you might think.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.913
[grunting]

39:10.915 --> 39:12.016
Okay.

39:12.583 --> 39:13.718
Soy milk.

39:14.118 --> 39:15.419
Gotcha.

39:15.886 --> 39:16.987
[Leandro] Anyway...

39:18.122 --> 39:19.957
so I go to restock
on the beans.

39:21.692 --> 39:26.530
I go in down the first aisle,
next to the artisanal breads,

39:26.530 --> 39:29.900
and there's this old lady there
with these gaudy
fucking rings on,

39:31.502 --> 39:34.538
ten coats of makeup
and this bushy unibrow,

39:34.538 --> 39:36.607
taking up the last
of them fucking beans.

39:42.613 --> 39:45.583
garrote her with me shoelace,
but I thought,
"No, that ain't right."

39:46.917 --> 39:49.453
I want to watch the life
drain out of her eyes...

39:51.622 --> 39:53.557
put me hands
around her chubby neck,

39:54.158 --> 39:56.160
squeeze her and see her puff

39:56.160 --> 39:59.897
and sweat that mascara
right out of
her fat fucking face.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.868
Or stab her in her armpit.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.870
[chuckles]

40:05.870 --> 40:08.739
A lot of people don't know
there's a nerve cluster there.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.876
And then I'll just watch her
piss herself right there
in the bakery section.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.012
All because of soybeans.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.715
Stupid shit, really.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.851
Everybody thinks it sometimes.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.123
Just out on the motorway

40:26.123 --> 40:28.526
or standing in the queue
at the supermarket.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.964
The only difference
is that I could've done it.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.001
I have done it.

40:37.001 --> 40:38.803
I wanted to do it,
but I didn't.

40:41.071 --> 40:43.207
It took everything I had,
but I didn't do it.

40:51.749 --> 40:55.052
[Jo] Leo...
Leo, it's important
to know our triggers.

41:14.004 --> 41:15.806
[Ben] What was your first kill?

41:15.806 --> 41:17.074
What?

41:17.074 --> 41:18.809
-[Ben] Your first kill.
-[spits]

41:19.143 --> 41:20.644
I can't remember.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.149
-[Ben] Come on.
-I don't know.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.219
We all have a first one,
though.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.623
I'll tell you
the first one I felt.

41:32.623 --> 41:33.724
Lady Ming.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.893
[Krystal] Are you kidding?

41:37.127 --> 41:39.830
You killed Ming?

41:42.800 --> 41:45.703
Oh, you kept that quiet,
didn't you,
you sneaky son of a bitch?

41:45.703 --> 41:47.671
[Markus] I fucking knew it.

41:48.239 --> 41:51.609
I fucking knew it.

41:51.609 --> 41:56.280
Only a professional
could've taken down
that evil old cow.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.649
You know,
everyone said it was cancer.

41:58.649 --> 42:01.585
I'm actually
mildly impressed.

42:01.585 --> 42:04.121
The bosses still
call me that too,
the fucking cancer.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.790
Like it's clever.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.561
-How did you do it?
-Poison.

42:12.596 --> 42:15.032
For that to pass
as something
other than poison,

42:15.032 --> 42:17.635
the doses
would have to be small.

42:17.635 --> 42:21.272
It would have to be
done over a period
of weeks, months.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.073
Seventy-two weeks,
four days.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.847
-How did you get access?
-She was my godmother.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.931
[Krystal] What I don't get is
how does the head of the triad

42:46.931 --> 42:51.669
become godmother
to some low-rent enforcer?

42:51.669 --> 42:53.003
[Leandro]
That wasn't the story.

42:53.003 --> 42:54.972
[Krystal]
Well, let's make it the story.

42:54.972 --> 42:58.108
How the fuck did no one know?

42:58.108 --> 42:59.843
[Leandro]
'Cause I was good at me job.

43:01.845 --> 43:03.347
I worked years for that family.

43:05.215 --> 43:08.252
When you love what you do,
you never work a day
in your life.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.954
I worked every fucking day.

43:11.855 --> 43:12.957
I was good at it.

43:14.124 --> 43:15.726
I did what I had to do.

43:16.961 --> 43:19.029
I just didn't know
I'd have to do so much.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.101
The job's killing.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.070
I'm not under
any illusion about that.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.373
But what I didn't know
until Ming...

43:30.674 --> 43:33.344
it's not about killing them.

43:33.344 --> 43:37.815
It's about how many times
we have to kill ourselves
to do it.

43:37.815 --> 43:41.919
Or how many times it takes
what's best about you
and fucking rips it out.

43:44.154 --> 43:46.624
And the worst part is,
it never really dies.

43:48.058 --> 43:49.793
I wish it would.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.228
Would make it so much easier.

43:53.097 --> 43:57.735
But it just sits there,
the best part of you,
sick and hurting.

43:59.103 --> 44:00.971
And every time
you think it's gone...

44:03.073 --> 44:07.077
every time you think
you can't die inside anymore,
you fucking do.

44:07.077 --> 44:09.780
And then it feels like
the first time all over again.

44:12.883 --> 44:14.818
[Jo] Okay, let's thank Leandro
for sharing.

44:15.919 --> 44:17.054
Thank you, Leo.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.356
[all] Thank you, Leo.

44:21.058 --> 44:23.027
[phone buzzing]

44:26.096 --> 44:27.798
[sighs] Christ.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.970
[woman on phone] Finally.

44:32.970 --> 44:35.739
-Hello, V.
-I really need to speak to you.

44:35.739 --> 44:38.242
-Are you busy?
-No, no, of course
I've got time for you.

44:38.242 --> 44:41.712
It's happening again.
I'm gonna hurt someone.
I know I am.

44:41.712 --> 44:43.981
You're the reason
I moved out to LA.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.382
You're the only one
who helps me.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.418
In a calm manner,
nice and controlled.

44:47.418 --> 44:48.886
I don't feel in control.

44:48.886 --> 44:51.255
Now tell me,
what kicked it off?

44:51.255 --> 44:52.890
What was your trigger?

44:52.890 --> 44:56.060
[sighs]
I was just making a sandwich.

44:57.127 --> 45:01.165
I was calmly making
a controlled sandwich.

45:01.165 --> 45:03.067
V, are you pacing?

45:05.035 --> 45:06.303
Picture my face.

45:07.171 --> 45:08.439
Sit down.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.973
Yeah, fine.

45:09.973 --> 45:11.709
Okay.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.844
Back to the sandwich.

45:13.844 --> 45:16.213
Can I ask you a question?
What kind of sandwich
were you making?

45:17.481 --> 45:19.383
[woman] Chicken.

45:19.383 --> 45:24.354
Yeah. Yeah. It's classic.
It's the bones, innit?

45:25.923 --> 45:27.725
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.294
I really wish there was
more information available,

45:30.294 --> 45:33.931
but, unfortunately,
the funding...

45:34.798 --> 45:37.868
Well, it simply isn't there.

45:37.868 --> 45:41.338
As your sponsor,
I should have
had the foresight

45:41.338 --> 45:43.407
to have warned you
about the chicken thing.

45:45.476 --> 45:48.378
Next time, buy fillets.

45:48.378 --> 45:51.048
Violet, I'm going to
have to call you back.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.154
[footsteps]

45:59.890 --> 46:01.458
-Hey.
-Hello.

46:03.494 --> 46:04.995
I liked what you said.

46:05.996 --> 46:07.297
It was a good story.

46:10.067 --> 46:13.470
Yeah, I've also been
thinking a lot about
what you said earlier.

46:13.470 --> 46:15.873
They're a fucked-up bunch,

46:15.873 --> 46:17.775
but who better to listen
to how fucked-up you are

46:17.775 --> 46:19.176
than a fucked-up bunch?

46:20.811 --> 46:21.945
[door clicks]

46:22.479 --> 46:23.781
Speak of the devils.

46:29.052 --> 46:31.121
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.924
-Are we interrupting
something here?
-Nope.

46:33.924 --> 46:35.359
[coughing]

46:36.927 --> 46:42.366
You know that
2.5 million people die
of second-hand smoke?

46:43.433 --> 46:45.369
Well, fuck off back
downstairs then, Ben.

46:45.369 --> 46:46.403
[coughs]

46:51.341 --> 46:53.010
[door opens]

46:55.179 --> 46:56.847
[door closes]

46:56.847 --> 46:59.550
Which hospital was it
you said you worked at again?

46:59.550 --> 47:00.918
The Royal Bridge.

47:03.353 --> 47:04.488
Why do you ask?

47:04.488 --> 47:06.156
Oh, no reason.

47:06.156 --> 47:08.091
Just now I know
where to send
my mother-in-law.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.194
[giggles]

47:11.995 --> 47:13.397
[laughing]

47:33.584 --> 47:35.919
-[Ben] Krys.
-[Krystal] What?

47:35.919 --> 47:40.023
[Ben] You were a drama queen
at school, right?

47:40.023 --> 47:43.327
[Krystal]
Actually, Ben, I was the queen
of fucking everything at school.

47:44.328 --> 47:46.029
[Leandro]
She means she was a slag.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.631
[Krystal] Oh, fuck off, Leo.
Go fuck yourself.

47:47.631 --> 47:49.266
Oh, please!

47:51.168 --> 47:54.104
Can't we come together
for just one night

47:54.104 --> 47:58.475
and put the ego and posturing
and one-upmanship aside?

47:58.475 --> 48:00.410
You know, listening and respect.

48:00.410 --> 48:03.080
"Do unto others"
and all that other
fucking nonsense.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.018
-[door bangs]
-[man grunts]

48:33.176 --> 48:35.012
[Jo] What do you think, Markus?

48:35.012 --> 48:37.915
[Markus] I think all you guys do
is talk in fucking monologues

48:37.915 --> 48:41.985
and I feel I'm stuck
on a rooftop with a bunch
a dodgy Bond villains.

48:41.985 --> 48:43.453
-[laughter]
-[helicopter hovering]

48:43.453 --> 48:44.554
Guys.

48:50.027 --> 48:51.261
[Leandro] Found him.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.096
-[Jo] Who?
-[Krystal] Or her.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.564
[Jo] Who?

48:54.564 --> 48:56.266
[Leandro]
Whoever killed the senator.

48:56.266 --> 49:01.471
[Krystal] Yeah, Jo,
I think the no-phone rule
is about to go bust.

49:03.073 --> 49:05.275
We could check
on the television
downstairs.

49:08.312 --> 49:09.579
[sirens wailing]

49:16.720 --> 49:18.455
[helicopter hovering]

49:30.567 --> 49:31.969
[thunderclap]

49:33.637 --> 49:36.473
[Markus] Oi. Excuse me, pal.
Who the fuck are you?

49:36.473 --> 49:39.543
-[Krystal] Hey, he just
asked you a fucking question.
-[Jo] Yeah, okay.

49:39.543 --> 49:41.678
Can we help you?

49:41.678 --> 49:43.981
I would hope so, Joanna.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.516
-[Krystal] What the fuck?
-[Markus] You know this fucker?

49:46.516 --> 49:48.585
-Senator Kyle.
-John.

49:48.585 --> 49:50.620
No fucking way.
No fucking way.

49:50.620 --> 49:52.189
[grunts]

49:52.189 --> 49:54.191
-Whoa, whoa!
-[scuffling]

49:55.058 --> 49:56.426
[Jo choking]

49:57.527 --> 49:59.162
[Leandro] I don't mean to be
out of order here,

49:59.162 --> 50:00.998
but why are you here
and not fucking dead?

50:01.331 --> 50:02.432
Ask her.

50:02.432 --> 50:03.533
You know him?

50:03.533 --> 50:05.435
[Ben] You mind us asking how?

50:05.435 --> 50:09.706
The guy was supposed
to miss, right?
That was the plan.

50:09.706 --> 50:11.341
So what the fuck happened?

50:11.341 --> 50:13.744
[Markus]
I'm kinda thinking that too.

50:13.744 --> 50:17.047
-What the fuck's going on?
-[Krystal] He just asked you
a fucking question.

50:17.047 --> 50:20.550
-You changed the deal.
-No, no, no, nothing changed.

50:20.550 --> 50:22.519
-So why was I shot tonight?
-I don't know.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.154
So you were hit?

50:24.154 --> 50:25.422
[groans]

50:25.422 --> 50:27.657
-You what?
-I don't know.

50:28.525 --> 50:30.460
You lying piece of shit.

50:30.460 --> 50:32.396
-I don't know! Christ!
-[Leandro] Everybody calm down.

50:32.396 --> 50:33.764
Senator, what happened?

50:38.168 --> 50:39.236
[gunshot]

50:39.236 --> 50:40.370
[crowd screaming]

50:50.047 --> 50:51.648
The area is secured, sir.

50:51.648 --> 50:53.717
That's the second time
I've heard that today.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.187
So excuse me
if I have zero confidence
in you fucking morons.

50:57.187 --> 50:58.455
[panting]

50:58.455 --> 51:00.223
-Wait outside.
-Sir.

51:00.223 --> 51:02.192
I prefer to bleed in private.

51:02.526 --> 51:03.627
Get out!

51:04.227 --> 51:05.295
[groans]

51:06.663 --> 51:10.333
For a moment,
I thought it was just a misfir.

51:10.333 --> 51:12.602
Think of the new voters
I'd get surviving this.

51:12.602 --> 51:15.272
[newscaster on TV]
...just released
by the American Embassy

51:15.272 --> 51:17.441
confirms that
Senator John Kyle was killed
in this morning's attack.

51:19.142 --> 51:21.812
[Senator Kyle]
But that was just a moment.

51:21.812 --> 51:25.215
The real mistake
was that I was still alive.

51:27.350 --> 51:28.618
[door closes]

51:31.421 --> 51:32.622
That way.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.560
[pool balls clacking]

51:36.560 --> 51:38.595
[Ben] Did the bullet go
all the way through?

51:38.595 --> 51:41.465
-Get away from me.
-Well, I can take a look.

51:41.465 --> 51:43.667
-[Krystal] Ben, what the fuck
are you doing?
-I'm helping.

51:43.667 --> 51:45.535
[Krystal] Why?

51:45.535 --> 51:47.671
-What do you mean why?
-You're not a fucking doctor.

51:47.671 --> 51:49.372
-I thought maybe--
-Just get off.

51:49.773 --> 51:50.874
Oh!

51:52.576 --> 51:53.844
Calvin.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.278
You are.

51:55.278 --> 51:56.480
Fix the man.

51:56.480 --> 51:58.281
-No. I'm fine.
-Yes, of course.

51:58.281 --> 52:00.183
[Leandro] Then it doesn't hurt
for him to look.

52:01.518 --> 52:03.553
[Calvin] You need stitches.

52:03.553 --> 52:06.690
A needle and thread.
There's a first-aid kit
upstairs.

52:08.792 --> 52:09.893
I'll go.

52:11.528 --> 52:13.263
That's deep.

52:15.732 --> 52:17.534
Should we even be doing this?

52:18.735 --> 52:19.803
[Ben] Doing what?

52:20.770 --> 52:22.472
The guy's supposed to be dead.

52:24.374 --> 52:27.644
[Calvin] But he is not.
He is here and he is wounded.

52:28.378 --> 52:31.414
He should be there and dead.

52:31.414 --> 52:34.451
So they're gonna be
looking for him.

52:34.451 --> 52:37.154
They don't need to look
because they are the CIA

52:37.154 --> 52:39.189
and they weren't supposed
to hit me at all.

52:39.189 --> 52:41.625
But I guess someone
didn't get that memo tonight.

52:41.625 --> 52:42.726
[Leandro] The CIA?

52:43.660 --> 52:45.262
This is some dark shit.

52:46.396 --> 52:48.431
I promise you, John,
nothing changed.

52:48.431 --> 52:50.901
-The plan was still the plan.
-Not for everyone.

52:50.901 --> 52:53.370
-Well, I had no idea.
-Really?

52:53.370 --> 52:58.208
The breaking news report that
Senator John Kyle of California
had been assassinated

52:58.208 --> 53:01.578
wasn't a clue that
maybe something tonight
had gone upside down?

53:01.578 --> 53:05.248
Really sorry.
Can you go back to the bit
about the CIA, please?

53:05.248 --> 53:07.384
-[Senator Kyle] What?
-Well, you said CIA,

53:07.384 --> 53:09.186
as in the Central
Intelligence Agency?

53:09.186 --> 53:10.787
-Yes.
-John.

53:10.787 --> 53:12.956
[Leandro]
As in the Central fucking
Intelligence Agency.

53:12.956 --> 53:14.357
Why, you don't know?

53:14.357 --> 53:16.293
-[Leandro] Know what?
-John.

53:17.827 --> 53:19.729
Who do you think
runs these meetings?

53:20.497 --> 53:21.932
[Ben] So CIA runs KA?

53:22.499 --> 53:23.600
John.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.770
Who did you think ran this?

53:26.770 --> 53:28.305
[all] Jo.

53:28.305 --> 53:29.673
Same thing.

53:30.540 --> 53:31.975
[Ben] You're CIA.

53:32.776 --> 53:33.877
Thanks a lot, John.

53:33.877 --> 53:37.647
What I wanna know is
why you even called
this meeting tonight.

53:37.647 --> 53:39.516
[Markus] Thank you.

53:39.516 --> 53:41.818
Did I not fucking tell you?

53:41.818 --> 53:43.820
-Did I not fucking tell you?
-Markus, why don't you
shut the fuck up?

53:43.820 --> 53:44.921
-[Markus] Fuck off.
-[thunder rumbles]

53:44.921 --> 53:47.224
[Leandro] Oh, fucking brilliant.

53:47.224 --> 53:49.559
[Jo] Okay. Okay.
Everyone calm down.
Let's get some light.

53:53.964 --> 53:56.800
Come on, boys and girls.
Gather round.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.768
[Calvin]
Everybody must listen to Jo.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.008
Hmm.

54:09.279 --> 54:12.549
Do I work for the CIA?

54:14.784 --> 54:15.885
Yes, I do.

54:17.387 --> 54:18.888
And so do all of you.

54:20.557 --> 54:22.459
Sorry. How's that?

54:24.694 --> 54:25.795
Hmm.

54:27.297 --> 54:30.500
284 days ago,
Sergei Rokmenonov

54:30.500 --> 54:33.470
was skipping across Red Square
on his way to work.

54:33.470 --> 54:34.804
The Ministry of Justice.

54:34.804 --> 54:36.606
[man whistling]

54:36.606 --> 54:38.942
Never made it to work
that morning

54:38.942 --> 54:41.444
because 650 yards
from the Ministry building,

54:41.444 --> 54:42.746
-he was shot and killed.
-[gunshot]

54:43.747 --> 54:46.816
You know how I know
it was 650 yards?

54:46.816 --> 54:50.020
Because that's the optimum range
for an SV-9 sniper rifle.

54:51.755 --> 54:53.723
Isn't that right, Ben?

54:53.723 --> 54:55.692
See, I'm not just a pretty face.

54:56.993 --> 54:58.662
And then two days later,

54:58.662 --> 55:00.864
a secure payment
was made to a bank account.

55:02.299 --> 55:05.635
And the only two people who know
the exact amount of that payment

55:06.603 --> 55:08.905
are the owner
of the bank account

55:08.905 --> 55:11.541
and the person
that authorized the transfer.

55:12.942 --> 55:14.944
So, Ben,

55:14.944 --> 55:20.450
if I were to say that £150,000
turned up in your bank account

55:20.450 --> 55:23.019
two days after Rokmenonov
was killed in Moscow...

55:24.487 --> 55:27.724
would you say that was
just a fantastic guess

55:28.958 --> 55:31.094
or would I know something?

55:31.094 --> 55:32.996
Well, that wasn't the CIA.

55:32.996 --> 55:34.931
Ah, Ben.

55:34.931 --> 55:36.900
It wasn't.
It was Steven Sim--

55:36.900 --> 55:39.602
Yes, Steven Sims from
the Alistair Holdings Group,
yes.

55:39.602 --> 55:43.807
But who do you think
Mr. Sims and AHG work for?

55:43.807 --> 55:47.110
God, the cute ones
are always so thick,
aren't they, Calvin?

55:47.110 --> 55:48.445
[chuckles]

55:49.546 --> 55:50.947
And two years ago,

55:50.947 --> 55:52.782
a patient was rushed
to the Royal Bridge,

55:52.782 --> 55:54.951
complaining of chest pains
and blurry vision.

55:54.951 --> 55:56.720
[siren wailing]

55:56.720 --> 55:58.855
And you were the only resident
on call that night,

55:58.855 --> 56:01.691
so of course
you found the swollen aorta,

56:01.691 --> 56:03.493
but you didn't
do anything about it.

56:03.493 --> 56:04.594
[labored breathing]

56:04.594 --> 56:08.431
You just waited and watched,

56:09.132 --> 56:10.834
as we knew you would.

56:10.834 --> 56:12.135
[machine beeping]

56:12.135 --> 56:13.670
And it was...

56:15.505 --> 56:16.573
beautiful.

56:17.140 --> 56:19.008
[beeping intensifies]

56:19.008 --> 56:21.411
And eight hours later,
the patient was dead.

56:21.411 --> 56:23.012
[monitor flatlines]

56:23.012 --> 56:25.615
Now he happened to be
the head of the Armenian Rite

56:25.615 --> 56:27.951
who was threatening to expose
certain agency contracts

56:27.951 --> 56:30.687
in exchange for immunity
from the Ministry of Justice,

56:30.687 --> 56:33.823
so you really helped us out
on that one, Calvin.

56:33.823 --> 56:35.058
[Jo and Calvin chuckle]

56:36.960 --> 56:42.432
And then, 11 months ago,
Michelle Huang Ming
died of cancer...

56:45.001 --> 56:47.704
after having been poisoned,

56:47.704 --> 56:51.174
but before she was able to sell
certain classified information

56:51.174 --> 56:53.743
to the Ministry
of State Security in China.

56:54.944 --> 56:56.613
Ming was a double agent.

56:58.081 --> 57:00.083
Leandro, I know
this broke your heart...

57:01.584 --> 57:03.553
but you helped us clean house.

57:06.923 --> 57:09.893
And £200,000. Not bad.

57:13.530 --> 57:17.667
And then, only last week,
our own Marky Marky Markus
over here,

57:17.667 --> 57:21.137
he put a bullet in the eyeball
of Officer Harold Morano,

57:21.137 --> 57:23.706
who was here
holidaying with his wife.

57:23.706 --> 57:26.209
Officer Morano
was about to give
a deposition at a trial

57:26.209 --> 57:29.679
that would eventually
have linked
the new Medellin Cartel

57:29.679 --> 57:31.881
to certain agency operatives.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.819
Yeah, you thought the hit
came from your brother.

57:35.819 --> 57:37.654
He thought it came
from Tyson Mulbury.

57:37.654 --> 57:39.189
And Marbury thought
it came from...

57:40.590 --> 57:41.691
You get the idea.

57:42.792 --> 57:44.527
£18,000.

57:45.195 --> 57:47.664
Love how cheap
you street boys are.

57:47.664 --> 57:49.098
Fuck you.

57:49.098 --> 57:50.733
Fuck you, too.

57:50.733 --> 57:52.469
[laughs]

57:53.770 --> 57:54.871
[Leandro] What about Krystal?

57:54.871 --> 57:57.140
Mmm? Krystal?

57:57.140 --> 57:59.242
I don't have to tell Krystal
who Krystal works for,

57:59.242 --> 58:02.245
because Krystal
has known all along
who Krystal works for.

58:04.080 --> 58:08.485
Just as I have known all along,
thanks to these meetings.

58:08.485 --> 58:11.221
How to get each
and every one of you

58:11.221 --> 58:14.257
to do exactly
what needed to be done.

58:17.026 --> 58:18.495
Everyone, that is...

58:21.097 --> 58:22.198
except you.

58:25.969 --> 58:29.506
This was the biggest operation
that we'd planned
for eight months.

58:29.506 --> 58:33.510
We'd practiced, we'd rehearsed,
and still something went wrong.

58:33.510 --> 58:36.513
Someone gave you
a where and a when

58:36.513 --> 58:38.948
and told you
to say the word "Pisces."

58:39.883 --> 58:41.017
And so, here you are,

58:41.017 --> 58:44.854
and you're the only one
I haven't met.

58:44.854 --> 58:48.725
So, as you can imagine,
I'm really looking forward
to hearing your story.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.660
[phone buzzing]

58:55.064 --> 58:56.165
Christ.

58:58.902 --> 59:01.037
-Hello, V.
-[VioleStop cutting me off.

59:02.071 --> 59:03.873
I'm starting
to get a picture here.

59:04.807 --> 59:06.209
Has this girl...

59:06.209 --> 59:09.679
Has this girl done
anything to upset you

59:09.679 --> 59:15.552
or have you just
taken a disliking to her
for another reason?

59:15.552 --> 59:18.988
Is there
a logical explanation

59:18.988 --> 59:21.291
as to why you want
to cause her pain?

59:24.294 --> 59:26.963
Yes, there's a reason.

59:26.963 --> 59:29.966
Did you not just hear
anything I just said about her?

59:29.966 --> 59:32.802
She's doing it on purpose
to make me feel insecure.

59:36.005 --> 59:37.140
Yeah.

59:37.607 --> 59:38.975
Yeah, we know what's...

59:40.009 --> 59:41.778
we know what's going on here,
don't we?

59:43.112 --> 59:44.213
You're different.

59:45.982 --> 59:47.984
You feel alone.

59:47.984 --> 59:50.186
Everyone else around you
doesn't understand

59:50.186 --> 59:52.322
how you find yourself
in this position.

59:53.323 --> 59:55.058
You feel in danger.

59:56.626 --> 59:58.728
The threat levels are high.

59:58.728 --> 01:00:00.196
You're in fight mode
to protect yourself.

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:04.033
And you feel
if this girl wasn't around,

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.835
that you would feel better
about yourself

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:08.371
and the fact that
she lives next door,

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.774
you find it very hard
to avoid her.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.743
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.013
I get it.

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.083
You know,
I had exactly the same thing
with my wife.

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:24.220
Really, you've gotta trust me.
I've been there.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:27.390
As I pointed that gun
at my wife's face,

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.726
I said,
"Any last words, Heather?"

01:00:30.693 --> 01:00:33.363
And three hours later,
I shot her.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:37.200
Wait. Really?

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.267
[chuckles]

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.069
No.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:43.706
No, Violet, love.
It was a joke. You get it?

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.742
"Last words."
"Three hours." Talks a lot.

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:47.777
I don't find this funny
and I'm not in the mood
for laughing.

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.412
I feel like crying.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.914
Do you know what?
I can't do mixed emotions
right now.

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:55.885
Yeah. No, I know. All right?
I know, darling. I'm so sorry.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:02.058
Violet,
you have to think about
the long-term consequences.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:07.063
You have to be
in control of your destiny.

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.866
Be fearless.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.903
You know
what you need to do.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:15.905
[Violet] I hear you.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.042
I know what I have to do.

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.711
Sorry.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:25.882
I will repent next week,
I swear.

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.686
[replaces receiver]

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:30.920
[dial tone]

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.162
Oh, Violet.

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.764
Violet.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.936
-[man on radio]
Are you in position?
-Yes, sir.

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.739
Good. Don't let him
get away this time.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:51.974
Wait for my signal, then...

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.744
Well, you know
what you need to do.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:56.312
[man] That's why none
of our phones are working?

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:58.147
Ain't you lot got stuff
that does that?

01:01:58.147 --> 01:02:00.850
-[Jo] We have everything.
-[man] Right.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.752
-So you're jamming
the whole city, then?
-[groans]

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:05.054
-[Jo] Probably.
-[man] Why?

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.257
Control the story
until they find me.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.326
-[Calvin] All done.
-[Ben] It was in the news.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.427
Not anymore.

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:15.431
[man] If it's already
out there at this point,
it don't actually matter.

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:17.500
-Why are we still here?
-I'm sorry?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.235
I said,
why are we still here?

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.205
Do you know,
Markus is right.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.340
Someone's gonna come
looking for you.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.342
-Probably.
-Definitely.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:27.510
[groans]

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.045
And that scares you?

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:31.180
Yeah. Yeah, it scares me.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.882
It should fucking well
scare you too.

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:35.017
You're the one
they're trying to kill.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.920
And I'm sure as fuck
I'm not standing next to you
when they try again.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.156
My grandfather
always used to say

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:43.526
that a room
full of CIA assassins
is the safest place to be.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.495
Jo, no one gives a fuck
about your granddad.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.430
Uh, Calvin sits there.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:48.931
Why are you here?

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:51.167
How did you know?

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.335
-[Senator Kyle]
That there was a meeting?
-Yeah.

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.104
How do you think?

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:58.341
-I don't know.
-Because he is CIA too.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:00.810
[Markus] Jesus.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.479
I wanna talk about her.

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:05.848
No. No. No. Fuck her.

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:09.919
'Cause right now
we're talking about
this son of a bitch.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:14.423
Senator John fucking Kyle
of California,
who, by the way,

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.826
is the guy most likely
to become president

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:20.062
of the United fucking States
of America.

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.498
And he just so happens
to be CI fucking A.

01:03:22.498 --> 01:03:25.501
I fucking got that, Krystal.

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.805
-Trust me, I fucking got that.
-Did you?

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:36.312
But we're talking about her
and we're gonna talk about her.

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:39.282
Or I'm gonna lose
my fucking shit.

01:03:39.282 --> 01:03:41.984
It's almost like
I don't need to be here.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:44.520
Shut the fuck up,
bullshitter.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.926
Now...

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.395
we were gonna talk
about you.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.364
And we're gonna
talk about you.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:58.267
And that'll be...
fucking now.

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:02.538
Well, my name's Alice...

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:09.078
and I have been sitting here
listening to all of you.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.581
Really, I have. And...

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.083
I'm sitting here
wondering the same thing
all of you are wondering,

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:15.585
which is,
"What am I doing here?"

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.353
Because I don't want
to be a killer.

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:20.156
Alice, can you tell us
who told you about KA?

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.991
Yeah, that's what
I wanna know, too.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.292
I got a text.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.228
Okay. From who?

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:29.065
I don't know. It was blocked.

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:31.434
[Ben]
Jo, don't you send them out?

01:04:31.434 --> 01:04:32.969
Not exclusively.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.871
[Ben] What does that mean?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:37.506
-It means not exclusively.
-[Markus] But how does it work?

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.611
Why? Why us?

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.647
I would just like to point out

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:47.650
that you have all been
coming here for over a year

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:51.087
and this is the first time
any one of you
has asked this question.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:54.357
-[Senator Kyle]
Because you all fit the type.
-[Ben] What type?

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:56.359
Your personality profile.

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.994
Why would she get flagged?

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.098
Why does someone think
you should be here?

01:05:02.098 --> 01:05:03.566
[whispers]
'Cause I've killed people.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.368
-Duh. Obviously.
-[Leandro] Shut up a minute.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.272
Remember what we spoke about
on the roof.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:28.357
Six months after my mom died,
my dad started...

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.099
I was 13.

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:45.374
He just... He just resented me.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:52.949
[sniffles] No, no.
He... He hated me,

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:57.219
'cause most days
I can still feel the pressure
from his boot on my head.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.722
He used to make me
eat my dinner off of the floor.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:04.260
Those nights
were always the worst
when he would get me alone,

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:08.497
'cause they just lasted
a lot longer.

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.440
[sighs]

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.710
I'm so sorry.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.046
I couldn't even protect
my sister from him.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:31.153
I went on a school field trip
one weekend,

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:34.690
and even though we went
to the same school,

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:37.393
I was older,
so her class had to stay behind.

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:44.033
And I-I had two full nights
away from this...

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:46.235
this monster.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:48.471
When I got back, I...

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.042
[sniffles]

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.411
I knew she was different,
and I...

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:57.713
I knew,

01:06:57.713 --> 01:06:59.348
and all I could think
to myself was,

01:06:59.348 --> 01:07:01.250
"Alice, how could you
have left her here?"

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:06.389
There were so many things
that that man did to me

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:08.324
that I should have
wanted him dead.

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:10.026
But touching her...

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.295
Touching her was too much.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:17.066
I was pushed.
I was... I was pushed.

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:19.502
And I didn't even know
if I could do it.

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:23.172
You know, I wanted to,
but I didn't actually think
that I could,

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:27.076
because I was small and he was--
Oh, goddamn, he was so big.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.178
But I wasn't shaking.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.249
I wasn't scared. It wasn't hard.

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:38.220
It was easy.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.057
It's just been
way too easy on me.
I wanted him to fight.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:45.127
I wanted him
to make me work for it.
Throw me up against a wall.

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:47.096
Send pain through me. But I...

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:52.201
It was just over
way too quickly.

01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:55.337
And I just remember
wanting to do it again.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.112
Do you still want it?

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.149
What?

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.086
Do you still want to kill?

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.091
Every single day.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.359
I think we all know
why you're here.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:19.862
[sighs]

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:22.098
-I don't.
-I don't.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.499
I fucking don't.

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.633
Come on.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.603
Jo, if anyone needs group,
this girl does.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:30.372
Mmm, yes. I agree.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:33.142
And that would be great,
if this was group,
but this is not group.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.743
I've just explained that.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.712
There's no fantasy world
where murderers meet in a church

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.481
and exchange their philosophies
on killing.

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.515
This is a place for maintaining
contract killers.

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:43.219
I thought we were
in this place to--

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.653
So I ask again.

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:46.689
What is she doing here?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.425
This girl is not
a contract killer.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:54.729
-So what is she doing here?
-Whoa, whoa. Jo. Jo.

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.866
Calm down.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:59.835
Uh, what about
the no-weapons policy?

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:03.171
-[Jo]
This is my insurance policy.
-[Krystal] Jo. Jo.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.274
I hate to agree with Ben,
but think about it.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.709
[Senator Kyle] If you think
she has something
to do with this,

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.210
then you must do what--

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.379
Go to hell, John!
You're not my boss.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:12.314
Today was a mess,
and that's the end of it.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.618
Jade messed up
and Krystal went in
to sort it out,

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.353
as per our orders.

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.487
So that's why
she ain't here tonight,
is it?

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:21.590
You horrible bitch.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.193
And that's who
they found across town,
I'm guessing, yeah?

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:26.895
She was just doing her job.
It's not her fault
that Jade fucked up.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.863
You wanna blame anyone,
you can blame Jade.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:32.635
And as far as I knew,
that was it.
The mission failed.

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:36.171
A new date would be set
with a new shooter
who would miss as planned.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.742
So, John,
who actually shot you
is anyone's guess.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:42.845
But I still think that
she had something to do with it.

01:09:51.886 --> 01:09:53.389
[muffled sneeze]

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:54.490
Bless you.

01:09:59.261 --> 01:10:00.429
You.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:04.233
Stay right... there.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.337
That goes
for the rest of you.

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:12.908
[door rattling]

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.344
Well, hello.

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:17.346
Don't be scared.
Just come on out.

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:18.981
-[girl] Please.
Get away from me.
-[Jo] Come on out.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:21.584
-All right.
-Come here, you. Hello.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:23.552
What you doing in there,
you little fucking rat?

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.554
-[Senator Kyle] Fantastic.
-[Krystal] The plot thickens.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.623
[Jo] Okay, with all due respect,
Krystal--

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.758
Okay.

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.761
[chuckles] Talk.

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.664
No, no, no.
We are not doing anything
to this little girl.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.866
[Senator Kyle] Just do it.

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:40.736
-I'm sorry, Senator,
do you have children?
-That has nothing to do with it.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.738
-Down.
-Okay, all right, okay.

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.940
Everybody just stop,
stop, stop.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.875
Everybody needs to be calm.

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.745
There's just way, way, way,
way too much going on
right now.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:50.946
Okay, Alice, move.

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.818
Move.

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.354
All those in favor...

01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.422
raise your hands.

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:02.391
One, two, three, four.

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:05.661
I know what's happening here.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:09.031
If you can assemble this gun
by the time
Markus gets to the table,

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:11.867
then you know what,
you get to have it your way.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.703
-I don't do this. This is--
-[Markus] You can do it.

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.839
-Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
-Okay, Alice. Come on.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.907
Stop shaking. Stop shaking.

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:22.478
[Markus] One more.
And then I'm coming for you,
darling.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.281
[Leandro]
Fucking try it, boss.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.617
[Markus] You gonna shoot me?
Fuck you.

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:31.053
You want some of this? Huh?

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:33.689
Come on, then.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:35.824
[grunting]

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.764
-[bones crack]
-[screaming]

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:47.936
Get up.

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:50.973
Both of you.

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.611
Sweetheart, are you okay?

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:58.347
[Jo] Okay, I just had to
make sure that she was
just who she said she was

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.049
and not a professional killer.

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.383
Sweetheart, what's your name?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.454
Look, it's okay.

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.523
Morgan.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.425
Nice to meet you, Morgan.
My name is Alice.

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.659
[Senator Kyle]
Just get to the point.

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:12.995
I just need you
to be honest with me.

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.030
Morgan,
what are you doing here?

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.666
[Morgan]
I got in a bit of trouble.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.335
[Alice]
Okay, so then you hid here.

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.904
Did you hear anything
that happened tonight?

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.475
I did hear it.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:29.878
I heard all of it.

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.814
[Senator Kyle]
Well, that's it, then.
We have no choice.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:33.982
A rat is a problem
we don't need.

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:37.453
-Okay. Whoa. Wait. Hey, come on.
-[Senator Kyle]
Joanna, she heard everything.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:39.621
Yeah, exactly. She just heard
a bunch of people talking.

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:42.358
She didn't see anyone
do anything,
now did she, okay?

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.893
So everyone's
just gonna come now
and sit down and be calm.

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.628
Come on.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.631
Now! Come on!

01:12:50.632 --> 01:12:52.501
-Shit.
-Don't touch her.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:01.543
[Markus] Hey!

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:02.644
[Leandro] Come here.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.080
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.655
Hey. Okay, okay.

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:16.625
The last thing... Okay?

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.828
The last thing our Morgan here
wants to do is upset anyone,
right?

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:22.431
I mean, you're a smart girl.

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:25.000
You know that
no one would believe
such a crazy story.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:29.605
Look, we are not
trusting a kid.

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:31.740
She's gonna speak.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.809
Maybe not at first, Jo,

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.978
but one day,
she's gonna talk to a friend

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.615
or she's gonna
go to confession
and she will speak.

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.817
I won't. I swear.

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:46.088
You'll fucking speak, all right.
You shut your little
bitch mouth.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:47.689
Markus,
she's just a kid, man.

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.958
I know she's just a kid,

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.895
but that little bitch
is gonna bring all of us down.

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:55.864
And I kinda like my life.
I got shit to do.

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:58.467
Killing her
is not the solution.

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:01.470
Like Joanna said,
the situation is so ridiculous,
nobody will ever believe her.

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.038
-[all arguing]
-All be quiet!

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.007
-[Markus] Hey!
-[Jo] Jesus Christ!

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:07.443
Morgan, stop it. Shit.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.511
-Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
-[Alice] Don't come any closer.
Stay back!

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.979
[Krystal]
Jo, give me the fucking gun.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.648
Calm down.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.016
[gunshot]

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.818
Shit!

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:17.753
-Fuck.
-[Krystal]
Sorry, it was an accident.

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.088
-[Markus] Krystal!
-[Krystal] No. Fuck.

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.124
Move!

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.829
Everyone fucking move!

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:29.965
Get back inside.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.104
Krystal,
I need to take a look at Jo.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:40.042
No. I said
get back inside now!

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.211
I need to look at her.
I need to look at Jo.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:44.580
-[Krystal] Calvin, shut up.
Get inside.
-I need to get over there.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.515
-No!
-[Krystal] Fucking move.

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.116
No, I need to get over there.

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:49.485
Move!

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:51.253
[yelling continues]

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:02.064
Huh.

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:07.870
[door opens]

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:17.779
Well, that changes things.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:19.815
Don't you agree?

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.684
Don't you agree?

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.054
[groans]

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.289
-Alice.
-[whimpers]

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.924
Alice, what are you doing,
love?

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:30.058
Hey. Fucking leave 'em.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:33.295
[Alice] Think about it.

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:35.063
[Morgan grunting]

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.270
I'm doing what has to be done.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.073
You think
she's gonna keep quiet
after what she just saw?

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.676
And then we're all supposed
to go down for it?

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.711
No. I've got a family.

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:52.281
And I'm not losing them
because of
somebody else's actions.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:54.182
-[gasping]
-[Senator Kyle] She's right.

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:56.618
Alice, let me do it.
You're not made for it.

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.254
[Leandro] I've been in some
fucked-up situations...

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:03.559
[Krystal] Okay.
Okay, do you know what? Fuck it.
Let's make it interesting.

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:06.562
Let's see who wants to do it.
Markus, you wanna have a go?

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.965
Yeah,
I'm fucking happy to do it.
Sure. Put the fucking gun down.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.068
Benny boy, why don't you
have a fucking go?

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:15.704
I told you, I'm not having
any part of killing a kid.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.039
Noted.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.140
Calvin?

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:23.245
"Noted"?

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.950
No, absolutely not.
I'm not killing a child.

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:33.855
For fuck's sake, Calvin,
she's barely a fucking child.
She's what, 14?

01:16:33.855 --> 01:16:35.624
Hey, how old are you?

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:37.993
[Leandro] Alice, Alice,
what's the crack here, love?

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.829
How about you let Morgan go,
we have a bit of a chat,

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.298
make some rational decisions?

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:45.334
[Krystal] Why don't you
just fucking shut up
and let her finish?

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:48.737
[grunting]

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:11.860
You okay?

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.300
Let's get back to business.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.369
What are you doing, love?
This isn't you. [groans]

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:25.040
You've got no idea
who I am, Leo.

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:29.311
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:31.680
[Jo] She...

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:34.016
is the new boss.

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.784
Fuck off.

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.086
[Senator Kyle] Joanna?

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:39.187
[Jo laughs]

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.358
Jo, what the fuck?

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:47.229
Krystal, I knew that
you would understand.

01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:48.730
Fucking dickhead.

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.434
[chuckles]

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:54.870
Joanna, I demand to know--

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.171
[gunshots]

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:58.707
[Markus] Fuck!

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.310
Blanks. Of course.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.312
Sorry about the dramatics.

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:05.714
[pounding on door]

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.718
You expecting somebody, Joanna?

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.087
Christ, they found me.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.889
Somebody protect me.
I can pay.

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.291
Everything's for sale, right?

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.295
Oh, God.
Hold your breath, John.
No one's interested.

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:24.833
It's probably cops
doing door-to-door.
I'll go and take care of it.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.803
And then when I'm back,
everything will be explained.

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:30.038
Everything.

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.189
It's time.

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.025
Don't hurt the girls.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.202
Okay. They have gone.

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.375
All right, everybody.

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.212
First question.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:12.180
Why not just kill me?

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.449
That's what all of this
is about, right? Me?

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:17.052
That was my fault.

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:24.159
[cheering]

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.018
Ah, can't get the shot.

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:52.821
Jade was supposed
to shoot you and not miss.

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:54.356
Excuse me?

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.559
[Jo] But she messed up.

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:58.994
So I blew the dust
off the old Dragunov

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.262
and stepped in myself.

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.167
Sorry, John. Nothing personal.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:06.268
[gunshot]

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.502
[crowd screaming]

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:11.173
Oh. Missed the head.

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:14.009
So, what,
the company wanted rid of me?
Why not just finish me off

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.944
the moment I walked
through those fucking doors?

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.379
Why all this bullshit?

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.815
Because not everything
is about you, John.

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.052
[Ben] You said Dragunov.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.921
That's a Russian gun.

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.590
Well-spotted, Ben.

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:33.361
Well, as our wonderful senator
said earlier, what was it?

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.564
"Everything is for sale

01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.933
if the price
is high enough, eh?"

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:42.103
So, yes, the company
is under new management

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:47.042
and they just wanted to see
which of our members
have what it takes

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.010
to join the new administration.

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:51.413
A stress test, if you will.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.082
[Senator Kyle] What?

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:59.988
Let me introduce
Alissa Romanoff and her sister,
Morgana Romanoff.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.957
Wait, what?

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.259
Joanna?

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.894
[Jo] Oh, yeah,
the Russians pay more.

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.164
[Senator Kyle] Russian?

01:21:09.164 --> 01:21:10.932
[Alice] Well, by name.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.001
Sisters?

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.004
Sisters.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:18.907
Motherfuck.

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:24.012
See, the problem is, Senator,
they started too late with you.

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:28.016
A corruptible CIA agent
infiltrates the highest level
of the political system

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.185
to become a corruptible senator

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:33.889
and a corruptible president
surrounded by
corruptible yes-men.

01:21:34.923 --> 01:21:37.292
But if you start young,

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.362
well,
then you're a truer person,
incorruptible.

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:44.633
You see,
the Russian government
took us in,

01:21:44.633 --> 01:21:47.102
gave us both a purpose.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:52.307
So, Senator, please meet
your future replacement.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.076
This is a joke, right?

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:58.346
Does she look
like she's joking?

01:22:07.055 --> 01:22:08.223
It's been a pleasure.

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:10.525
Sorry, Calvin.

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:17.165
Markus, Krystal, you passed.
Come with us.

01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:19.100
Sorry, lads.

01:22:20.402 --> 01:22:21.670
See you after, Calvin.

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:33.448
Alice.

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:35.417
[sighs]

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:37.319
Leandro.

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:39.521
Sorry, you're cute, but...

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:41.690
not that cute.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.525
But I'm gonna
give you a chance.

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:47.329
Stay here one hour
and then you can leave.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:48.563
What, and that's it?

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.399
Yeah.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.134
One hour.

01:22:57.339 --> 01:22:58.440
[Ben] Traitor.

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:03.979
[Krystal] Do as you're told.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.748
-[gasping]
-[chuckles]

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.451
-Oh, you bitch.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.654
[exhales]

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:14.489
-[Krystal whistling]
-[footsteps fading]

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.100
[door shuts]

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.602
[Leandro]
Right, that's it, then.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.378
Hey!

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:40.648
Well, it's a trap.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.151
Right?

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:49.357
Right.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.143
One hour, then I can leave.

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:12.414
[Leandro]
She's lied to you all day.
Why should you trust her now?

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:23.558
Ah, Leo, I'd really hoped
you'd listen.

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:26.327
All you had to do
was wait one hour.

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:30.098
What is it with men
not wanting to follow orders?

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:32.434
[organ music]

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:37.572
[man]
You have to be in control
of your destiny, Alice.

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:38.673
[gun cocks]

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:42.644
Be fearless.

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:47.382
You know what you need to do.

01:24:49.317 --> 01:24:50.418
[gunshot]

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.382
Hey.

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:24.652
-Wanna swap? No?
-No.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:26.554
No, no, no!

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:27.755
[screams]

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.132
[Krystal]
You're fucking dead now.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.572
I fucking live for this.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:46.908
Excuse me.

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:53.481
Need a hand there, mate?

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:55.650
[gunfire]

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.922
[chuckles]

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.526
My boy Calvin in there.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.496
Killers Anonymous,
you fucking cock.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.568
Go on, Benny boy.

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:16.371
-[Alice] Where do you think
you're going?
-The heart.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:20.441
Seems as though
you've forgotten
how this works.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:26.347
[laughs]

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:28.183
Welcome to the fucking club.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.218
It's just, Jo, I mean...

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:32.320
What's the whole point of this
if we don't set standards?

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.322
There's rules
and those rules
have to be followed.

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:36.524
Jo, you missed your shot.

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:38.826
No. No.

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.628
No! [screaming]

01:26:42.931 --> 01:26:46.234
-Go on. Do it.
-Step back.

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:47.902
[Krystal]
Feels different up close,
doesn't it, Benjamin?

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.571
-[Ben] Give her the knife.
-Please.

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:51.639
I should fucking
shoot you, Krys.

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.876
-Give her the knife.
-Give me the knife.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.912
I could do this.
I could do this!

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.314
-[thud]
-[groans]

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:03.985
God bless.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.524
There you are.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:33.448
[groaning]

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:43.491
-It's done.
-[maThere, you see?

01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:45.360
I told you you could do it.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.661
Yeah.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:47.829
Easier than I thought.

01:27:51.799 --> 01:27:53.434
Well done, Alice.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:59.841
[newscaster]
The story surrounding
yesterday's assassination

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:03.311
of the US Senator John Kyle
continues to unfold.

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:05.580
Further bodies believed
to be connected to the case

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.916
have been found in a church
in the bank area of London.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:11.753
Early speculation suggests
that the US Government

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:14.522
was somehow involved
in the plot against Kyle.

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:17.625
As of yet,
there has been no comment
from the American Embassy.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:25.566
[man]
There's always gonna be people
who need our help.

01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:27.669
People who have the itch,

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:30.038
who just need
to be shown the path.

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:35.310
They need someone
who can listen, who can help.

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.546
I can't go on forever,

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.981
but for my girls...

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:43.584
this is just the beginning.

01:28:43.584 --> 01:28:44.786
[door opens]

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:49.824
Hello?

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:53.561
Hello?

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:57.765
[door opens]

01:28:58.733 --> 01:28:59.934
[door closes]

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:04.939
Lovely night for it.

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.543
Yeah. I suppose it is.

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.645
You lost your way?

01:29:11.979 --> 01:29:13.348
Something like that.

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.116
It's one flight down.

01:29:15.917 --> 01:29:16.984
Oh.

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.554
I see. Thanks.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:22.023
[chuckles]
Don't look so nervous.

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.860
You're in good hands.

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:29.797
[humming]

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:47.615
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:50.918
I'm not sure
if I'm in the right place.

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:54.722
I was told to say "Gemini."

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:58.926
Definitely in the right place,
and the first to arrive.

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.634
Welcome to Killers Anonymous.
