01:12.417 --> 01:13.333
Really?

01:14.917 --> 01:16.417
I'm fine.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.248
We'll be there soon.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.417
That's what you
said in Portland.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.625
Does it always rain here?

02:31.292 --> 02:33.292
I don't know, honey.

03:32.458 --> 03:34.208
Is that
the new house?

03:34.958 --> 03:36.250
Yeah.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.500
I like our old one.

03:41.958 --> 03:43.581
Hi! Hi!

03:43.583 --> 03:44.498
There's Sandra.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.208
Oh, welcome!

03:47.542 --> 03:48.956
Sorry, did we
keep you waiting?

03:48.958 --> 03:50.581
Oh, not at all, not at all.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.581
We just were doing
a little tidying up.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.417
This must be Audrey!

03:56.667 --> 03:58.792
Are you excited to move
into your new house?

04:00.750 --> 04:02.498
Okay!

04:02.500 --> 04:04.331
Let's go ladies!

04:04.333 --> 04:05.165
Ah!

04:05.167 --> 04:06.456
Out of the chariot,
into the castle!

04:06.458 --> 04:07.790
Come on!
Hop to, let's go!

04:07.792 --> 04:08.792
Come on, honey.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.790
Welcome home!

04:19.458 --> 04:20.583
Here.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.623
I see the truck got here.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.581
I just had them go by
your labeling instructions.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.331
Very thorough, Liz.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.456
I get it from my Mom.

04:31.458 --> 04:32.623
What?

04:32.625 --> 04:34.331
The organizing gene.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.665
Ugh, I could use
that in my office.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.040
If you ever run
out of benefits...

04:38.042 --> 04:38.915
Oh my God.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.706
I can't believe that
I just said that.

04:40.708 --> 04:42.040
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

04:42.042 --> 04:43.456
Sandra, it's all right.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.373
Hey, Audrey!

04:45.375 --> 04:47.667
Did you know that I went
to college with your Mom?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.042
Honey!

04:55.500 --> 04:58.456
You know, I am so
sorry about Jason...

04:58.458 --> 05:00.331
And if there is anything
that I can do, I will be...

05:00.333 --> 05:01.581
Thank you.

05:01.583 --> 05:02.458
Of course.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.665
Now let me show
you this kitchen.

05:05.667 --> 05:07.498
And I can't wait til you see
the master bath upstairs.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.790
It's remodeled, it's amazing!

05:08.792 --> 05:09.665
Let's go!

05:32.083 --> 05:32.831
Mom?

05:32.833 --> 05:33.667
Mm-hm?

05:35.417 --> 05:37.500
Do I have to go
to school tomorrow?

05:39.125 --> 05:40.415
Yes.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.415
Can't I stay home a day,

05:42.417 --> 05:44.081
just to unpack and settle in?

05:44.083 --> 05:45.581
You really shouldn't
miss anymore school, honey.

05:45.583 --> 05:49.665
It's a brand new house
in a brand new town.

05:49.667 --> 05:50.790
Just one day?

05:50.792 --> 05:52.333
No "just one's."

05:53.625 --> 05:55.458
We were lucky to get
you in at Saint Francis.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.375
I hate it here.

05:59.667 --> 06:00.708
How can you say that?

06:02.542 --> 06:05.123
We just got here, literally,
like four hours ago.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.206
Why can't we just live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

06:07.208 --> 06:08.540
They always knew what to do.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.458
Are you saying I don't?

06:14.750 --> 06:19.750
Why child, I carried you in my
belly for nine whole months.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.581
Uterus.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.415
Yes, my uterus.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.873
Babies don't gestate
in the stomach.

06:25.875 --> 06:26.792
Sure.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.873
But the belly, see
that's a general

06:30.875 --> 06:32.708
term for the whole area...

06:33.708 --> 06:35.623
...where I carried you.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.706
So that means that I know
you better than anybody else.

06:38.708 --> 06:43.458
Which means that I know what
you need right this very minute

06:46.792 --> 06:48.417
Fortune cookie.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.458
Come on.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.623
Wow, for me?

06:53.625 --> 06:55.748
Oh thank you, Mother.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.167
Just take it.

07:05.792 --> 07:06.915
What is it?

07:06.917 --> 07:09.625
I will meet a tall stranger.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.581
What?

07:12.583 --> 07:14.456
I know, not even in town a day

07:14.458 --> 07:16.748
and the fortune is already
trying to set me up on a date.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.623
That's a lame fortune.

07:18.625 --> 07:19.583
What about yours?

07:22.542 --> 07:25.542
Hidden secrets will
be revealed to you.

07:26.958 --> 07:31.540
Hmm. Like how to
cooperate with your Mother?

07:31.542 --> 07:33.833
Or, who let that fart.

07:35.708 --> 07:36.790
What?

07:36.792 --> 07:37.998
May I be excused?

07:38.000 --> 07:38.998
Oh!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.873
Oh you little!

07:41.875 --> 07:44.790
How do you make
it smell that bad?

07:44.792 --> 07:46.498
Chinese food!

07:46.500 --> 07:47.792
No, that does
not work that fast!

07:50.917 --> 07:53.540
I'm gonna
go unpack my room.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.667
It smells like rotten eggs!

07:57.542 --> 08:00.790
You better not forget to
shower tonight young lady!

08:00.792 --> 08:03.915
You smell like a thousand
miles of hard road!

08:03.917 --> 08:05.833
And farts!

09:44.958 --> 09:46.373
So nice to finally
meet you, Mrs. Charles.

09:46.375 --> 09:47.915
Oh, you too, Mrs. Phillips.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.331
And lovely to have you Audrey.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.498
Thanks.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.081
And that
is Mr. Stonewall's classroom.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.748
He's expecting you.

09:53.750 --> 09:55.081
Go ahead, honey.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.665
I'll be back at
3:15 to pick you up.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.875
You must be Audrey.

09:59.042 --> 09:59.956
Yeah.

09:59.958 --> 10:01.748
Thanks so much
for fitting her in.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.081
Please join us.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.748
I know it was
a last minute thing

10:04.750 --> 10:05.873
and I really hated
having to pull

10:05.875 --> 10:06.998
her out of her old school, but...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.040
I understand.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.956
We really
needed a change.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.456
I don't mean to pry but,

10:12.458 --> 10:13.956
would you like me to
set up an appointment

10:13.958 --> 10:15.667
for Audrey with the
school counselor?

10:16.708 --> 10:17.625
Oh.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.956
We're still talking through
some stuff at home, so.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.706
I was gonna go over
and meet the pastor,

10:23.708 --> 10:24.415
introduce myself.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.956
Oh, terrific.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.790
You're love Father
Felix, he's wonderful.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.123
Great.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.790
Just wanna get the
lay of the land first.

10:30.792 --> 10:32.456
And don't worry about
Audrey, Mrs. Charles,

10:32.458 --> 10:34.956
we'll take good care of her.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.000
Thanks.

12:14.292 --> 12:16.042
Come in, it's unlocked!

12:17.083 --> 12:19.540
Hi, hi, happy housewarming!

12:19.542 --> 12:20.750
Hey!

12:21.500 --> 12:23.040
I'm just making dinner!

12:23.042 --> 12:24.831
I brought wine!

12:24.833 --> 12:25.915
Ooh, thanks!

12:25.917 --> 12:27.290
Liz, this place looks amazing.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.081
You have unpacked so much.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.250
Organizing gene, remember?

12:36.000 --> 12:36.917
Right.

12:43.583 --> 12:44.958
Wow!

12:46.250 --> 12:50.165
Audrey, you're quite
the little artist.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.750
It's about my Dad.

12:56.917 --> 12:59.123
Do you have time
for a glass or...

12:59.125 --> 13:01.206
You know what, no...

13:01.208 --> 13:02.873
I have a date...

13:02.875 --> 13:04.831
Oh. - He is a doctor.
So fingers crossed.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.917
I'm not gonna look
like this forever, so.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.542
And you guys should have some...

13:10.583 --> 13:12.250
...mother daughter time I think.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.831
- Uh, okay.
- And then after,

13:15.833 --> 13:18.123
Open the wine,
drink the whole bottle.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.540
I'm gonna go find a husband.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.331
Uh, uh, uh.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.917
And then I will call you and
tell you every dirty detail.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.081
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.290
Have fun.

13:27.292 --> 13:28.125
Bye!

13:37.083 --> 13:38.583
My drawing scared her.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.165
Let me see.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.581
I'm not finished.

13:42.583 --> 13:43.998
Honey.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.248
Mr. Stonewall says we should
draw what we feel inside,

13:57.250 --> 13:59.165
and that can help
when we feel sad.

13:59.167 --> 14:00.956
Who's this next to you?

14:00.958 --> 14:02.292
Caleb Douglas.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.915
Is that a boy from school?

14:06.917 --> 14:08.583
Yeah, he's new too.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.250
Nobody talks to him either.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.042
Well, I think that is sweet
of you to be his friend.

14:22.167 --> 14:26.331
I think it's wonderful of you
to take him under your wing.

14:31.417 --> 14:34.208
Especially when
you're a new kid too.

14:38.042 --> 14:39.083
Honey?

14:43.375 --> 14:45.167
How long til dinner?

14:48.083 --> 14:49.167
About five minutes.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.625
You wanna get washed up?

14:52.958 --> 14:53.667
Okay.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.206
Help me.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.206
So, this guy working at
a grocery store, right?

16:19.208 --> 16:22.165
He's in the produce aisle,
he's putting stuff away

16:22.167 --> 16:25.081
and he feels this
tap on his shoulder,

16:25.083 --> 16:26.331
there's this lady.

16:26.333 --> 16:30.040
She says, "Hi,
where's the broccoli?"

16:30.042 --> 16:31.748
And he's like, "Actually,
we're all out of broccoli,

16:31.750 --> 16:33.748
"but we do have a new
shipment coming in tomorrow."

16:33.750 --> 16:35.331
She's like, "Okay, great."

16:35.333 --> 16:37.540
10 minutes later, "Excuse me."

16:37.542 --> 16:39.540
Turns around, it's
the same lady.

16:39.542 --> 16:43.331
She says, "Hi,
where's the broccoli?"

16:43.333 --> 16:45.748
And he just kinda stares
at her for a little bit,

16:45.750 --> 16:49.498
and then he says, "Actually,
we don't have anymore broccoli,

16:49.500 --> 16:51.665
"but we will have a new
shipment coming in tomorrow."

16:51.667 --> 16:52.623
Okay.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.248
10 minutes after that
he's still working.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.331
Is there a punchline?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.040
Yeah there is, it's coming.

16:57.042 --> 17:00.123
And then she says, it's
the same lady again.

17:00.125 --> 17:01.831
And she says, "Where's
the broccoli?"

17:01.833 --> 17:03.790
And he's like, "Uh,
can you do me a favor,

17:03.792 --> 17:06.498
"can you spell 'cat,'
like in catastrophe?"

17:06.500 --> 17:08.206
She says, "C-A-T."

17:08.208 --> 17:10.248
"Can you spell 'dog,'
like in dogmatic?"

17:10.250 --> 17:12.123
She says, "D-O-G."

17:12.125 --> 17:14.415
"Okay, can you spell
'fuck,' like in broccoli?"

17:14.417 --> 17:16.831
And she says, "There's
no 'fuck' in broccoli.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.081
"Like that's what I've been
trying to tell you lady!"

17:25.125 --> 17:30.125
I love you.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.500
I love you.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.583
All right, we'll
see you tomorrow.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.625
Audrey?

21:10.417 --> 21:11.581
Hey honey.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.708
Throw it back!

21:14.333 --> 21:15.665
Is that Caleb
you're playing with?

21:15.667 --> 21:18.040
He's not coming up.

21:18.042 --> 21:20.292
Well he's probably
looking for that ball.

21:21.583 --> 21:22.792
You want me to go get him?

21:24.833 --> 21:25.750
Okay.

21:29.500 --> 21:34.500
Caleb?

21:40.833 --> 21:43.458
Caleb!

21:48.625 --> 21:50.417
Caleb, you okay?

22:41.792 --> 22:42.708
Caleb!

23:04.500 --> 23:05.873
Oh!

23:05.875 --> 23:07.542
Oh, I'm so sorry!

23:09.417 --> 23:12.542
Did you see the little
boy who ran down here?

23:17.208 --> 23:18.583
Do you know where he went?

23:22.542 --> 23:25.125
Okay, if you could
just keep an eye out.

23:27.583 --> 23:28.500
Okay.

23:48.917 --> 23:50.165
I couldn't find him honey.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.581
We should go.

23:54.583 --> 23:55.665
What?

23:55.667 --> 23:56.915
Oh, yeah, let's go.

23:56.917 --> 23:58.581
Mrs. Charles.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.706
Oh, Mr. Stonewall,
the kids ball,

24:00.708 --> 24:02.748
it just, it went
down the basement.

24:02.750 --> 24:06.167
I couldn't find Caleb,
but I told the janitor.

24:07.917 --> 24:10.248
I was hoping we could
set up some time to meet?

24:10.250 --> 24:12.915
Yeah, of course,
we'll come see you soon.

24:12.917 --> 24:15.665
I have some time
after class on Friday.

24:15.667 --> 24:16.792
Yeah, that should work.

24:26.958 --> 24:30.998
So, Howard Stonewall is
Audrey's art teacher, right?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.748
Yeah.

24:32.750 --> 24:33.831
Why, you know him?

24:33.833 --> 24:35.623
I mean, I sold him his house

24:35.625 --> 24:37.790
and my son was in his class

24:37.792 --> 24:42.290
and he's very smart
and very single...

24:42.292 --> 24:44.206
And very young.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.748
There's nothing
wrong with that.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.706
Sandra, I am shocked at you.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.831
I never thought I could
shock a Catholic girl.

24:52.833 --> 24:53.831
Look at me.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.831
Michael hated that art
therapy bullshit anyway.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.042
But he never did anything
crazy like Audrey, so.

25:06.583 --> 25:07.667
Yeah, well she's,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.500
she's saying it's helping, so.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.583
She's been through a lot.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
How are you doing?

25:21.625 --> 25:22.500
Fine.

25:24.583 --> 25:25.500
Really?

25:28.833 --> 25:30.292
What do you want me to say?

25:31.750 --> 25:33.331
Anything.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.042
Nothing?

25:37.917 --> 25:41.292
It's just hard.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.625
I wish I would've met him.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.000
Me too.

25:52.042 --> 25:52.875
Me too.

25:56.708 --> 25:58.083
Have you met Father Felix yet?

25:59.583 --> 26:01.290
Oh yeah.

26:01.292 --> 26:03.956
I mean, it's on the agenda.

26:03.958 --> 26:04.875
Good.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.373
Ah, there she is!

26:08.375 --> 26:09.873
You all set?

26:09.875 --> 26:10.915
Ready.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.415
Is it that time?

26:12.417 --> 26:14.081
No, no, no, no,
just finish your wine.

26:14.083 --> 26:15.915
I just gotta check homework
and I'll be back out.

26:15.917 --> 26:16.833
Oh, twist my arm.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.625
Goodnight Audrey.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.123
Goodnight.

26:26.125 --> 26:29.331
Have you seen Dad's dog tags?

26:29.333 --> 26:31.042
Yeah, I'll go get 'em.

26:34.042 --> 26:35.083
Don't mind if I do.

26:37.917 --> 26:38.833
Okay.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.040
Mom.

26:43.042 --> 26:43.750
Mm-hm.

26:45.375 --> 26:49.125
Dad... He's
really dead, right?

26:54.083 --> 26:54.958
Yeah sweetie.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.083
I would never joke about that.

26:59.833 --> 27:01.833
And we certainly
wouldn't have moved away.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.708
So, why can I
hear him sometimes?

27:11.750 --> 27:12.625
Um...

27:14.875 --> 27:17.456
Well some people believe
that our loved ones

27:17.458 --> 27:19.625
can talk to us from heaven.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.500
He talks to me.

27:25.375 --> 27:28.625
Like he's in the
same room with me.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.000
What does he say?

27:40.083 --> 27:43.875
He tells me he loves us.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.998
He tells me he's
sad we moved away.

27:50.000 --> 27:50.917
Oh.

27:52.750 --> 27:55.750
And he told me not to
talk to the bad man anymore.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.125
What?

27:59.750 --> 28:01.040
Who?

28:01.042 --> 28:02.875
The janitor in
the school basement.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.417
The one who took
our soccer ball.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.165
When did you talk to him?

28:08.167 --> 28:09.875
In the hallway yesterday.

28:10.958 --> 28:12.708
He doesn't like kids very much.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.456
Sister Beatrice says
he's harmless, but

28:16.458 --> 28:18.458
I think there's
something wrong with him.

28:20.042 --> 28:22.040
You listen to your Father,

28:22.042 --> 28:24.831
you stay away from the
janitor, and the basement,

28:24.833 --> 28:26.958
and Sister Beatrice
for that matter.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.208
Okay.

28:31.042 --> 28:31.708
Good.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.206
I love you sweetie.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.042
I love you too.

28:44.917 --> 28:46.042
What about our prayer?

28:48.208 --> 28:49.083
Oh.

29:03.292 --> 29:05.956
Hail Mary,
full of grace,

29:05.958 --> 29:07.540
our Lord is with thee.

29:07.542 --> 29:09.915
Blessed art thou among woman,

29:09.917 --> 29:13.248
and blessed art the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

29:13.250 --> 29:17.248
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

29:17.250 --> 29:20.833
now and at the hour
of our death, amen.

29:26.917 --> 29:29.915
Heavenly Father,
thank you for this day

29:29.917 --> 29:33.125
and the restful night to come.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.248
We pray for...

29:35.250 --> 29:36.500
My Dad.

29:37.792 --> 29:38.500
Your Dad.

29:40.125 --> 29:42.290
Grandma and Grandpa.

29:42.292 --> 29:44.250
Grandma and Grandpa,
good, who else?

29:46.000 --> 29:50.081
And Mr.
Stonewall, he's nice.

29:50.083 --> 29:53.998
And Sandra, who helped
us find this lovely home.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.123
Yes, and Sandra.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.540
In the name of the
Father, and of the Son,

29:58.542 --> 30:00.875
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.000
Amen.

30:17.542 --> 30:18.831
Goodnight sweetie.

30:18.833 --> 30:19.958
Goodnight, Mom.

30:26.042 --> 30:27.042
Open or closed.

30:28.042 --> 30:29.292
Closed is fine.

30:54.333 --> 30:55.915
Hey!

30:55.917 --> 30:57.083
Mrs. Charles!

30:59.167 --> 31:00.623
Mrs. Charles?

31:00.625 --> 31:02.165
Yeah.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.290
Do
you have a minute?

31:03.292 --> 31:04.167
Sure.

31:10.083 --> 31:11.623
I heard from Mr.
Stonewall yesterday

31:11.625 --> 31:14.081
about the incident
at the basement.

31:14.083 --> 31:17.081
Oh, there really
wasn't an incident.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.081
But it's just that
we keep the exterior

31:19.083 --> 31:22.206
basement door locked during
school hours for safety reasons.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.623
And we can't allow parents
to go exploring unescorted.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.248
But wait, hold on, let
me get this straight,

31:27.250 --> 31:29.623
I wasn't exploring.

31:29.625 --> 31:31.373
The kids soccer ball
went in the basement

31:31.375 --> 31:33.081
and Caleb wasn't coming back up,

31:33.083 --> 31:35.373
so I just went down
there to find him.

31:35.375 --> 31:39.415
But that's impossible because
the door is always locked.

31:39.417 --> 31:42.373
Look, Faye, the
door was wide open,

31:42.375 --> 31:44.623
so I really don't
need a lecture.

31:44.625 --> 31:46.415
And if you don't want people
going in the basement,

31:46.417 --> 31:49.415
you should talk to that
walking mountain of a janitor

31:49.417 --> 31:52.748
and make sure the door's locked
when the kids are playing.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.248
Hey Mom.

31:54.250 --> 31:55.375
Are you ready to go?

31:56.333 --> 31:57.248
We done here?

31:57.250 --> 31:59.206
But I'm
still not clear on...

31:59.208 --> 32:02.081
Like I said, you want answers,

32:02.083 --> 32:03.125
talk to your janitor.

32:04.167 --> 32:06.081
Come on honey.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.331
How was school?

32:07.333 --> 32:08.917
Fine.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.458
What took you so long?

33:53.542 --> 33:54.500
Excuse me?

33:56.125 --> 33:58.167
How was your drive
from San Diego?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.792
We've been expecting
you, Mrs. Charles.

34:09.250 --> 34:12.167
I'm Felix Connolly,
Pastor at Saint Francis.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.542
Welcome to our community.

34:18.292 --> 34:19.208
Thank you.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.123
I'm sorry, I'm not used to...

34:22.125 --> 34:24.375
I'm not a stickler for
formality Mrs. Charles.

34:27.292 --> 34:29.125
Well, in that
case, call me Liz.

34:30.250 --> 34:31.167
Liz.

34:33.917 --> 34:36.583
Is there anything we can do
to help you get settled in?

34:41.292 --> 34:42.583
Actually, there's one thing.

34:46.292 --> 34:47.375
My husband,

34:49.583 --> 34:50.417
Jason,

34:52.583 --> 34:53.458
he was

34:55.417 --> 34:57.250
killed in Afghanistan.

35:00.417 --> 35:01.417
I'm very sorry.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.250
Thanks.

35:07.417 --> 35:10.417
Okay, I uprooted my daughter

35:12.167 --> 35:13.498
and moved a thousand miles away.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.498
Feel like I've
forsaken my family

35:15.500 --> 35:19.500
and I might be doing
emotional harm to my child.

35:21.875 --> 35:24.375
Children are
very resilient, Liz.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.417
I doubt you're doing
any permanent damage.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.125
I'm also having
dreams about him.

35:37.875 --> 35:38.625
Jason.

35:39.958 --> 35:41.500
They're nightmares really.

35:43.167 --> 35:45.125
It's very common
among the bereaved.

35:46.292 --> 35:47.208
Is it?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.125
It's the mind

35:52.542 --> 35:54.290
trying to make
sense of something

35:54.292 --> 35:56.125
that can never make sense.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.333
Does he say anything
in the dreams?

36:04.333 --> 36:05.500
He tries.

36:07.250 --> 36:08.333
I never hear him.

36:09.625 --> 36:13.250
It's like I'm there with
him in the war zone.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.667
Are you sure it's normal?

36:17.958 --> 36:19.915
It's absolutely normal.

36:19.917 --> 36:22.206
We can talk about it
tomorrow if you'd like.

36:22.208 --> 36:23.458
I have 11 o'clock free.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.667
You will come by the office?

36:28.417 --> 36:29.500
Okay, sure.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.167
Okay.

36:36.458 --> 36:41.417
Oh, I know this wasn't a
formal confession, but,

36:42.708 --> 36:43.667
just to be safe.

36:50.542 --> 36:55.040
Ego te absolvo.
In nomine Patris,

36:55.042 --> 36:59.458
et Filii et Spiritus Sanctus

37:03.417 --> 37:04.333
Amen.

37:05.625 --> 37:06.542
Amen.

39:58.917 --> 40:00.206
Who do you think you are?

40:00.208 --> 40:01.540
Get the hell off my property!

40:01.542 --> 40:04.706
Secrets must be kept.

40:04.708 --> 40:06.873
Help them.

40:23.542 --> 40:24.915
May I help you?

40:24.917 --> 40:26.581
I need to talk
to Mrs. Phillips.

40:26.583 --> 40:28.498
Mrs. Charles, did we
have an appointment?

40:28.500 --> 40:30.790
Cut the shit Faye, I am
not in the mood this morning.

40:30.792 --> 40:32.748
I wanna know what right
you think you have

40:32.750 --> 40:35.748
sending school personnel
to my home to threaten me.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.956
I don't know what you mean.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.165
When was this?

40:39.167 --> 40:40.165
This morning.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.165
And who was there?

40:41.167 --> 40:41.958
Sister Beatrice!

40:43.167 --> 40:44.915
The Nun who harassed my daughter

40:44.917 --> 40:46.581
when I went into the basement.

40:46.583 --> 40:48.581
Sister Beatrice?

40:48.583 --> 40:50.581
Don't pretend you don't know.

40:50.583 --> 40:52.956
Look, I understand you not
wanting to face liability

40:52.958 --> 40:55.248
if some accident occurred
when I was down there,

40:55.250 --> 40:58.498
but it's your janitor who
left the door wide open!

40:58.500 --> 41:00.248
That's right, I wanted
you to talk to Mr. Dobbs.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.665
Gayle, would you call
Mr. Dobbs, please?

41:04.542 --> 41:06.956
Mr. Dobbs to the
principal's office please.

41:06.958 --> 41:08.706
Mrs. Charles,
let's discuss this.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.498
I don't know what
there is to discuss.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.540
Door was open, and I
certainly don't need

41:12.542 --> 41:13.956
a visit from Mother Superior

41:13.958 --> 41:15.915
to scare me into good behavior.

41:15.917 --> 41:19.248
I've had enough swollen
knuckles to last me a lifetime.

41:19.250 --> 41:22.208
- But Mrs. Charles, Liz,
- What?

41:23.625 --> 41:24.958
You
said Sister Beatrice.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.623
I don't know.

41:27.625 --> 41:28.956
That's what Audrey
said her name was.

41:28.958 --> 41:31.748
It's the slender Nun
with the severe face.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.623
Probably describes all of them.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.706
But here's the thing,
Saint Francis school does not

41:35.708 --> 41:38.748
have any Nuns on staff or
priests for that matter.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.665
Although we share
grounds with the church,

41:40.667 --> 41:43.833
the school hasn't employed
clergy in over 50 years.

41:45.917 --> 41:48.667
Well you should probably
let Sister Beatrice know that.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.998
Mr. Dobbs, did you have
the exterior basement

41:55.000 --> 41:57.665
door open any time
Tuesday afternoon?

41:57.667 --> 41:59.623
No, it's been locked
since school started.

41:59.625 --> 42:01.248
I use the interior access.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.581
So, at no time...

42:02.583 --> 42:03.873
I don't know who this is,

42:03.875 --> 42:05.833
but I'm talking about
the other janitor.

42:06.833 --> 42:08.290
The other janitor?

42:08.292 --> 42:09.831
He's huge!

42:09.833 --> 42:12.998
He's got greasy
hair and coveralls.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.583
He was in the basement
when I went down there.

42:16.375 --> 42:17.873
Mrs. Phillips?

42:17.875 --> 42:19.623
That's all
Mr. Dobbs, thank you.

42:19.625 --> 42:20.706
Sorry to take you
from your work.

42:20.708 --> 42:21.625
All right.

42:25.833 --> 42:26.833
Don't tell me.

42:30.042 --> 42:32.833
Mr. Dobbs is our only janitor.

42:37.875 --> 42:39.625
I went into the basement

42:40.875 --> 42:42.665
because one of your
students was down there

42:42.667 --> 42:44.833
and he wasn't coming back up.

42:47.833 --> 42:48.875
I was concerned.

42:50.708 --> 42:51.956
Did you even check on him?

42:51.958 --> 42:53.873
Was he ever even found?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.042
Not to my knowledge.

42:57.333 --> 43:02.083
In fact, we don't have
a Caleb enrolled here.

43:05.375 --> 43:07.833
Caleb Douglas.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.665
Audrey said he was new

43:10.667 --> 43:12.415
so he must be under your radar.

43:12.417 --> 43:15.790
Mrs. Charles, I know every
single one of our students.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.917
We don't have a Caleb
Douglas enrolled here.

43:20.083 --> 43:21.750
This is ridiculous.

44:08.125 --> 44:08.958
1957.

44:11.792 --> 44:13.167
You know that was
before my time.

44:14.833 --> 44:16.706
Well, according
to Mrs. Phillips,

44:16.708 --> 44:18.081
Saint Francis hasn't
employed clergy for years,

44:18.083 --> 44:20.415
but Audrey called
her Sister Beatrice.

44:20.417 --> 44:21.417
Mm-hm.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.042
And how's your daughter doing?

44:25.417 --> 44:26.998
Don't start with me, Father.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.165
My daughter did not
imagine that Nun,

44:29.167 --> 44:32.667
or that janitor, or that
little boy anymore than I did!

44:34.500 --> 44:36.915
Liz, when you've suffered
grief like you have,

44:36.917 --> 44:40.165
it's not unusual to have
dreams, visual hallucinations.

44:40.167 --> 44:42.792
It's your brain reacting
to trauma, that's all.

44:44.417 --> 44:46.498
I thought you were supposed
to help me with my grief.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.831
That's exactly what I'm doing.

44:48.833 --> 44:50.165
Well the dreams
are bad enough,

44:50.167 --> 44:52.998
I don't wanna feel anymore.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.998
Well the dreams are
your subconscious way

44:55.000 --> 44:56.708
of trying to make you feel.

44:59.167 --> 45:02.000
When it comes to grief,
there's no way out but through.

45:03.458 --> 45:06.456
Sooner or later,
you have to process.

45:06.458 --> 45:07.208
Okay.

45:09.833 --> 45:12.498
What if this is
the way I process?

45:12.500 --> 45:14.873
And what if this
Nun is a figment

45:14.875 --> 45:17.915
of my traumatized imagination?

45:17.917 --> 45:20.040
And why would my
daughter be hallucinating

45:20.042 --> 45:22.042
the exact same thing?

45:33.042 --> 45:34.000
You served?

45:35.250 --> 45:38.167
Yeah, Desert Storm, tanker.

45:41.125 --> 45:42.833
You're from back East, huh?

45:43.917 --> 45:45.500
New Rochelle, born and raised.

45:47.042 --> 45:48.750
Assigned here in '97.

45:49.500 --> 45:50.250
Why here?

45:52.875 --> 45:54.958
It's where they send
the trouble makers.

45:57.167 --> 45:59.083
I don't know, luck
of the draw I guess.

46:00.250 --> 46:01.500
It's a good community.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.956
Can you do something
for me, Father?

46:06.958 --> 46:08.248
Sure.

46:08.250 --> 46:11.040
Could you look through
the school records?

46:11.042 --> 46:13.581
Just to see if
Beatrice is employed

46:13.583 --> 46:15.915
anywhere in the Parish.

46:15.917 --> 46:17.833
And same with the
little boy, Caleb?

46:19.083 --> 46:22.165
Find out if he was
or is a student.

46:22.167 --> 46:24.998
I just wanna verify
that these people exist,

46:25.000 --> 46:28.125
so we can rule out that my
daughter and I are insane.

46:29.875 --> 46:30.792
Liz,

46:33.958 --> 46:35.292
I'm pretty sure
you're not insane.

46:38.125 --> 46:39.290
I'll be happy to do some digging

46:39.292 --> 46:40.542
around on your behalf, yeah.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.875
Thank you, Father.

46:46.250 --> 46:48.208
Let me know when I get
to meet your daughter.

46:52.042 --> 46:53.998
Well, if you're not
above a house call,

46:54.000 --> 46:56.042
why don't you have
dinner with us tomorrow.

46:57.292 --> 46:58.540
That sounds lovely.

46:58.542 --> 46:59.792
How 'bout five?

47:01.125 --> 47:02.040
That works.

47:02.042 --> 47:02.958
All right.

47:04.208 --> 47:05.540
Maybe I'll have some
more information

47:05.542 --> 47:07.331
based on what I can dig up.

47:07.333 --> 47:08.583
Take a business card.

47:10.042 --> 47:11.998
My cellphone's on there
in case you need it.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.623
Cellphone?

47:13.625 --> 47:15.040
Ooh, and email!

47:16.375 --> 47:17.915
Well priests are a
lot more tech savvy

47:17.917 --> 47:19.042
than when I was little.

47:22.167 --> 47:23.292
We're getting there.

47:28.875 --> 47:30.873
All right, tomorrow at five.

47:30.875 --> 47:31.583
Yeah.

47:33.250 --> 47:34.167
Thank you.

48:08.083 --> 48:09.042
Hi love.

48:12.375 --> 48:13.165
Jase.

48:13.167 --> 48:14.625
Do I
get a hug or what?

48:33.125 --> 48:35.081
I missed you.

48:35.083 --> 48:36.417
I miss you too.

48:54.375 --> 48:58.248
No.

48:58.250 --> 48:59.415
No, no!

48:59.417 --> 49:01.123
No, no, no, no, no, no!

49:01.125 --> 49:03.748
No, no, no, no, no, no!

49:03.750 --> 49:04.998
No, don't!

49:05.000 --> 49:06.123
Help them.

49:19.750 --> 49:20.458
Mom?

49:22.167 --> 49:23.208
Are you okay?

49:26.125 --> 49:27.000
Yeah.

49:29.042 --> 49:30.040
Oh come here.

49:30.042 --> 49:31.458
Come here, it's okay.

49:47.292 --> 49:50.250
I just had a
nightmare, that's all.

49:53.167 --> 49:54.125
About Dad?

49:59.125 --> 50:01.083
Yeah, yeah about Dad.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.417
He's still watching over us.

50:05.750 --> 50:06.500
I can feel it.

50:12.250 --> 50:13.500
So can I, honey.

50:16.375 --> 50:17.292
So can I.

50:23.500 --> 50:26.165
She's an extremely bright

50:26.167 --> 50:28.417
and precocious young
lady, Mrs. Charles.

50:30.083 --> 50:32.165
Great artist, and in
fact her vocab test

50:32.167 --> 50:34.331
this first week had the
highest score in the class.

50:34.333 --> 50:36.542
All correct, plus
the extra credit.

50:38.542 --> 50:39.831
That's good to know.

50:39.833 --> 50:41.540
But, you see, she's not very

50:41.542 --> 50:44.165
sociable with the
other children.

50:44.167 --> 50:46.206
While I admit it's great
she doesn't disrupt class

50:46.208 --> 50:47.292
with a lot of talking,

50:49.125 --> 50:51.831
well it's just a red
flag for me as a teacher.

50:51.833 --> 50:53.790
She's always been an
introvert Mr. Stonewall.

50:53.792 --> 50:57.123
Well, and that's absolutely
fine Mrs. Charles, I get it.

50:57.125 --> 50:59.248
Being 12, being a military kid,

50:59.250 --> 51:02.081
and going through the loss

51:02.083 --> 51:03.542
that your family
has gone through.

51:05.167 --> 51:07.540
I just hope we can
facilitate some help

51:07.542 --> 51:10.500
for her, her fragile,
emotional state.

51:12.125 --> 51:14.165
Your Mom lets
you read comic books?

51:14.167 --> 51:16.165
Sure, why?

51:16.167 --> 51:17.623
I have to sneak 'em.

51:17.625 --> 51:19.125
That's too bad.

51:20.250 --> 51:21.417
Which is your favorite?

51:23.208 --> 51:25.623
I like a lot of alternative
stuff and Manga mostly.

51:25.625 --> 51:29.831
"Torchlight Lullaby,"
"Glass Wings," "Bleach".

51:29.833 --> 51:31.083
I don't know those.

51:31.833 --> 51:33.125
Mine's "Batman".

51:34.583 --> 51:36.415
Well, it's not "Batman"

51:36.417 --> 51:38.333
but you can read
mine if you want.

51:48.833 --> 51:50.375
No, that's okay.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.250
The Sister doesn't like them.

51:54.292 --> 51:55.831
I'll get punished.

51:55.833 --> 51:57.581
She can't punish you.

51:57.583 --> 52:00.623
It's after school, and
reading comics isn't sinful.

52:00.625 --> 52:02.415
She's gonna punish me.

52:02.417 --> 52:03.583
Don't be scared, Caleb.

52:07.625 --> 52:08.542
Help me.

52:10.208 --> 52:11.581
I'm not
gonna pretend that

52:11.583 --> 52:15.165
we haven't been through
a kind of personal hell.

52:15.167 --> 52:16.125
The move was rough.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.500
On top of everything else.

52:19.958 --> 52:21.331
It's probably gonna take
Audrey a little more

52:21.333 --> 52:22.665
than a week to get settled in.

52:22.667 --> 52:24.665
Oh, for sure.

52:24.667 --> 52:28.456
I hope the drawing therapy
helps with her processing.

52:29.625 --> 52:31.498
Yeah, the drawings,

52:31.500 --> 52:33.248
they're a real dinner
time conversation starter,

52:33.250 --> 52:34.208
let me tell ya.

52:35.875 --> 52:38.873
And it's not like she
hasn't made any friends.

52:38.875 --> 52:41.248
She's gotten pretty
close to that kid Caleb.

52:41.250 --> 52:43.375
I'm not familiar with a Caleb.

52:44.292 --> 52:46.373
Come on.

52:46.375 --> 52:48.917
She's talking to him
on the bench right now.

53:00.375 --> 53:02.917
I'm sorry, there doesn't
seem to be anyone with her.

53:04.583 --> 53:06.250
Well he probably just left.

53:07.333 --> 53:08.665
And on that note.

53:08.667 --> 53:10.456
Do keep in touch,
Mrs. Charles.

53:10.458 --> 53:11.915
If there's anything I can do

53:11.917 --> 53:14.540
or you wanna talk
over coffee sometime.

53:14.542 --> 53:16.290
Ah, thank you Mr. Stonewall,

53:16.292 --> 53:18.581
but my dance card
is pretty full.

53:18.583 --> 53:20.498
Oh, I wasn't...

53:20.500 --> 53:22.500
I gotta go, dinner
won't cook itself.

53:47.417 --> 53:48.998
Father!

53:49.000 --> 53:49.708
You made it!

53:50.625 --> 53:52.373
Oh, thank you.

53:52.375 --> 53:53.333
I'm still cooking.

53:56.542 --> 53:58.415
Well looks like you're
getting settled in.

53:58.417 --> 53:59.333
Yeah.

54:03.583 --> 54:04.708
This must be Audrey.

54:05.750 --> 54:06.750
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:07.792 --> 54:09.417
I'm Father Felix.

54:10.417 --> 54:11.458
It's nice to meet you.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.417
Are you here to
tell them to go away?

54:15.792 --> 54:17.581
Tell who to go away, dear?

54:17.583 --> 54:18.750
The angry people.

54:20.417 --> 54:21.540
Audrey, gather
up your art stuff

54:21.542 --> 54:22.417
and get changed for dinner.

54:29.042 --> 54:32.665
Are these the angry people?

54:32.667 --> 54:34.000
They don't want us here.

54:36.583 --> 54:41.583
Well, we'll just have to
see about that, won't we?

54:44.042 --> 54:45.500
I'll help you with the wine.

54:57.792 --> 55:00.792
So, tanker huh?

55:02.042 --> 55:03.623
What was that like?

55:03.625 --> 55:05.625
If you don't mind
talking about it.

55:10.458 --> 55:11.790
We rolled into Iraq,

55:11.792 --> 55:14.042
we were like medieval
knights on horseback.

55:16.625 --> 55:19.750
Endless line of armor,
far as the eye could see.

55:21.833 --> 55:23.542
Hellbound for Babylon.

55:26.667 --> 55:30.498
Well fires made the sky
pitch black all day.

55:31.667 --> 55:33.415
Exploding vehicles lit it up

55:33.417 --> 55:35.665
like cheap fireworks.

55:35.667 --> 55:37.415
I guess we'd been
there maybe a week

55:37.417 --> 55:39.500
when something came
out of the desert

55:41.167 --> 55:45.498
and started stalking us.

55:45.500 --> 55:46.375
Every night,

55:50.083 --> 55:52.748
pacing back and forth
in front of the sentries

55:52.750 --> 55:54.458
like some kind of beast.

56:00.583 --> 56:02.540
IR, night vision,
nothing picked it up.

56:02.542 --> 56:03.542
No tracks.

56:07.625 --> 56:08.625
But we could feel it

56:11.208 --> 56:12.583
moving in the shadows.

56:15.875 --> 56:16.917
Making noise.

56:22.583 --> 56:24.708
Like garbled voices
on the radio.

56:27.167 --> 56:28.792
What was it?

56:32.708 --> 56:33.875
It wasn't us.

56:37.167 --> 56:42.375
It wasn't them.

56:45.542 --> 56:46.875
It wasn't human.

56:52.625 --> 56:56.500
I was as close to pure
evil as I've ever come.

57:05.583 --> 57:06.750
And it followed me home.

57:10.542 --> 57:11.625
Holy shit.

57:12.917 --> 57:14.875
So I learned how
to defend myself.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.167
You're gonna need more wine.

57:46.792 --> 57:47.917
What did you find out?

57:51.250 --> 57:53.623
There was in fact
a Sister Beatrice

57:53.625 --> 57:55.956
employed at Saint
Francis school.

57:55.958 --> 57:59.542
From 1945 to 1958.

58:01.208 --> 58:03.958
So, why is she still
hanging out at the school?

58:05.792 --> 58:08.665
Maybe she's looking for
directions to a graveyard.

58:08.667 --> 58:10.956
She died in 1963.

58:10.958 --> 58:12.831
She died?

58:12.833 --> 58:14.956
At a psychiatric
hospital in Manhattan.

58:14.958 --> 58:16.665
How is that possible?

58:16.667 --> 58:18.000
If this is who you're seeing,

58:19.917 --> 58:21.708
I think you're picking up
on some very old baggage.

58:22.875 --> 58:24.581
Two young boys disappeared

58:24.583 --> 58:27.790
near the school
in 1957, students.

58:27.792 --> 58:30.583
A janitor was implicated
in their disappearance.

58:31.792 --> 58:33.748
The school was
closed for two years.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.998
Sister Beatrice was
transferred to a Diocese

58:36.000 --> 58:37.706
clear across the country.

58:37.708 --> 58:39.000
No bodies were ever found.

58:41.625 --> 58:43.917
Was the janitor a big guy?

58:45.042 --> 58:46.833
That's
one word for it.

58:48.583 --> 58:49.667
Andrew Hurst.

58:50.833 --> 58:52.833
6'7" 350.

58:54.250 --> 58:55.998
Had some kind of
behavioral disorder,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.040
but I can't find his medical
records to see what it was.

58:59.042 --> 58:59.958
This...

59:01.625 --> 59:03.875
This is the guy that
I saw in the basement.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.373
Are you sure?

59:07.375 --> 59:09.748
There's no
mistaking that face.

59:09.750 --> 59:11.040
No charges were ever brought,

59:11.042 --> 59:12.915
but Andrew was transferred

59:12.917 --> 59:15.042
and committed to
Agnews State Hospital.

59:16.625 --> 59:19.292
Where he died in 1970.

59:20.875 --> 59:25.290
Is this your Nun?

59:25.292 --> 59:26.042
Yeah.

59:28.708 --> 59:30.542
Is this your
daughter's playmate?

59:32.583 --> 59:33.667
Caleb Douglas.

59:35.292 --> 59:36.667
Caleb Edgerton.

59:37.750 --> 59:38.875
Douglas Edgerton.

59:40.083 --> 59:40.958
Twins.

59:42.667 --> 59:45.042
These were taken a year
before they disappeared.

59:49.083 --> 59:50.333
Congratulations Liz.

59:53.083 --> 59:55.915
Within 48 hours of
moving to a new town,

59:55.917 --> 59:59.331
you've managed to dredge up
a mystery from 60 years ago.

59:59.333 --> 1:00:01.790
How does one gal get so lucky?

1:00:01.792 --> 1:00:02.750
Hey, don't worry.

1:00:03.708 --> 1:00:04.792
You won't face it alone.

1:00:06.417 --> 1:00:08.081
Yeah.

1:00:08.083 --> 1:00:11.333
I'm BFF's with a
spiritual Kung-Fu master.

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:15.915
I was gonna say, "If God be
for us who can be against us,"

1:00:15.917 --> 1:00:18.750
but I like the Kung-Fu.

1:00:22.167 --> 1:00:24.373
It's late, I've taken up
enough of your evening.

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:25.125
I should go.

1:00:26.667 --> 1:00:27.667
You can keep those.

1:00:29.125 --> 1:00:29.958
It was nice.

1:00:31.667 --> 1:00:32.833
If not a bit traumatic.

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:39.915
What's next?

1:00:39.917 --> 1:00:42.956
Well, why don't you
poke around online,

1:00:42.958 --> 1:00:45.706
see if what I left you
leads you anywhere.

1:00:45.708 --> 1:00:48.915
Got some contacts back East
looking into the records for me.

1:00:48.917 --> 1:00:50.708
See if they come
up with anything.

1:00:51.833 --> 1:00:52.750
Okay.

1:00:55.792 --> 1:00:57.415
Thank you Father.

1:00:57.417 --> 1:00:58.625
Don't thank me yet.

1:00:59.958 --> 1:01:00.833
Oh,

1:01:04.167 --> 1:01:05.208
dinner was lovely.

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.165
Sweetie.

1:01:16.167 --> 1:01:17.790
Dad says they don't like us.

1:01:17.792 --> 1:01:19.748
Who doesn't like us?

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:22.165
Dad says Father Felix is
poking on a hornets nest!

1:01:22.167 --> 1:01:23.831
We could've just left,

1:01:23.833 --> 1:01:25.706
but now we have to
finish what we started!

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:51.042
Morning.

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:54.123
Morning.

1:01:54.125 --> 1:01:56.125
You and Father Felix
drank a lot last night.

1:01:57.208 --> 1:01:59.040
We had a
lot to talk about.

1:01:59.042 --> 1:02:00.958
About
Sister Beatrice?

1:02:02.208 --> 1:02:04.042
Among other things.

1:02:05.542 --> 1:02:06.792
Like what?

1:02:08.042 --> 1:02:09.956
It's complicated.

1:02:09.958 --> 1:02:13.790
Audrey.

1:02:13.792 --> 1:02:15.250
Are we going to
service tomorrow?

1:02:17.208 --> 1:02:18.083
Sure.

1:02:20.042 --> 1:02:20.917
Cool.

1:02:23.833 --> 1:02:25.165
I'm gonna go draw.

1:02:25.167 --> 1:02:26.917
Honey, you can draw down here.

1:02:28.250 --> 1:02:31.917
Nah, I'll be back
down in a little bit.

1:02:33.125 --> 1:02:34.042
Okay.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:25.875
Shh.

1:04:56.958 --> 1:04:58.081
You okay?

1:04:58.083 --> 1:04:59.042
Just thinking.

1:05:00.167 --> 1:05:01.165
About what?

1:05:01.167 --> 1:05:02.375
I like Father Felix.

1:05:04.125 --> 1:05:05.042
Yeah?

1:05:06.125 --> 1:05:07.415
He's nice.

1:05:07.417 --> 1:05:09.123
Yeah.

1:05:09.125 --> 1:05:10.375
He reminds me of Grandpa.

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:15.208
Well he's a bit
younger than Grandpa.

1:05:18.083 --> 1:05:19.458
I miss Grandma and Grandpa.

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:22.000
So do I.

1:05:23.958 --> 1:05:24.917
I miss Dad.

1:05:29.042 --> 1:05:30.000
So do I, honey.

1:05:35.083 --> 1:05:37.206
I want to go home!

1:05:37.208 --> 1:05:39.165
Audrey, stop it,
this is your home.

1:05:39.167 --> 1:05:40.665
No it's not!

1:05:40.667 --> 1:05:42.706
But Dad says we can't
go until we finish!

1:05:42.708 --> 1:05:44.248
Finish what?

1:05:44.250 --> 1:05:45.706
I don't know, but
I wanna go home!

1:05:45.708 --> 1:05:47.248
I hate it here, I hate it!

1:05:47.250 --> 1:05:49.206
That is enough young lady!

1:05:49.208 --> 1:05:51.040
You do not get to speak
to your Mother like that!

1:05:51.042 --> 1:05:52.123
I hate this house!

1:05:52.125 --> 1:05:53.375
I wanna go home!

1:06:08.792 --> 1:06:09.500
I'm sorry.

1:06:13.167 --> 1:06:15.958
Maybe it wasn't fair of
me to move us up here.

1:06:16.792 --> 1:06:18.125
Do we have to stay?

1:06:19.375 --> 1:06:22.375
Honey, I'm doing
the best I can, okay?

1:06:25.042 --> 1:06:25.708
Fine.

1:06:28.750 --> 1:06:30.250
Get ready for bed, please.

1:07:10.042 --> 1:07:14.333
Audrey, wake up.

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:19.167
Caleb, Audrey, let's go!

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:29.583
Quickly, before
the Sister comes!

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:42.292
What do you want?

1:08:44.625 --> 1:08:46.458
I need you to be strong.

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:50.333
I can't do this alone.

1:08:51.458 --> 1:08:52.333
Yes you can.

1:08:54.167 --> 1:08:55.167
Yes you can.

1:08:58.333 --> 1:08:59.375
I need you.

1:09:01.958 --> 1:09:03.333
I'm here.

1:09:06.458 --> 1:09:07.458
No you're not.

1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:30.623
Is Audrey okay?

1:09:30.625 --> 1:09:32.915
She's sleeping, but
Beatrice was here,

1:09:32.917 --> 1:09:36.206
and she held me
down and I couldn't,

1:09:36.208 --> 1:09:38.665
I couldn't scream
and I couldn't move.

1:09:38.667 --> 1:09:41.290
I think I am going crazy.

1:09:41.292 --> 1:09:43.500
Shh, okay, it's all right.

1:09:44.625 --> 1:09:45.542
I believe you.

1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:47.500
I saw her at the church.

1:09:49.375 --> 1:09:51.167
Okay, look.

1:09:54.333 --> 1:09:57.498
Beatrice's Father was
a very important man.

1:09:57.500 --> 1:09:59.248
Big church donor.

1:09:59.250 --> 1:10:00.373
He couldn't have been more proud

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:02.167
when his daughter became a Nun.

1:10:03.375 --> 1:10:04.917
That's when the rumors started.

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.040
The rumors about Sarah and Papa.

1:10:09.042 --> 1:10:09.750
Sarah?

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:14.540
Beatrice's name before
she took her vows.

1:10:14.542 --> 1:10:16.375
Sarah Hurst.

1:10:17.708 --> 1:10:19.542
Mother of Andrew Hurst.

1:10:20.542 --> 1:10:22.208
By her own Father.

1:10:23.708 --> 1:10:28.583
That explains why Beatrice
was so adamant about defending

1:10:30.375 --> 1:10:32.456
Andrew after the Edgerton
twins disappeared.

1:10:32.458 --> 1:10:34.456
Andrew couldn't defend himself.

1:10:34.458 --> 1:10:35.540
Why not?

1:10:35.542 --> 1:10:37.208
Somebody cut out his tongue.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:41.540
Beatrice and Andrew
both institutionalized.

1:10:41.542 --> 1:10:44.956
She steals a tile knife
from a hospital janitor,

1:10:44.958 --> 1:10:49.665
carves a sermon's worth of
Bible verses into her flesh,

1:10:49.667 --> 1:10:52.748
kills an orderly.
Two days later she's

1:10:52.750 --> 1:10:54.458
dead of a systemic infection.

1:10:56.333 --> 1:10:58.333
God, she looks possessed.

1:10:59.750 --> 1:11:01.750
They're all in some
kind of limbo, Liz.

1:11:02.750 --> 1:11:04.998
Andrew was never baptized.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.081
No last rites when he died.

1:11:07.083 --> 1:11:09.250
By church rites,
he's a lost soul.

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.415
Edgerton twins
probably murdered,

1:11:12.417 --> 1:11:14.040
probably buried in
unhallowed ground.

1:11:14.042 --> 1:11:14.750
And Sarah.

1:11:17.292 --> 1:11:20.998
I think she's become a
conduit for something darker.

1:11:22.458 --> 1:11:23.542
Something much darker.

1:11:27.750 --> 1:11:29.415
Hang on a second.

1:11:29.417 --> 1:11:30.333
Audrey honey.

1:11:33.125 --> 1:11:34.333
Audrey, are you okay?

1:11:43.375 --> 1:11:44.292
What?

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:53.708
She needs you.

1:11:56.750 --> 1:11:57.625
Okay.

1:11:58.625 --> 1:11:59.500
She's gone.

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:03.292
Audrey's gone, I found this.

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:05.458
Okay.

1:12:07.458 --> 1:12:08.375
Let's go.

1:12:16.542 --> 1:12:17.706
Liz!

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:18.790
Stay, please.

1:12:18.792 --> 1:12:19.665
What?

1:12:19.667 --> 1:12:20.542
Trust me!

1:12:26.667 --> 1:12:29.748
Someone's been
telling our secrets.

1:12:29.750 --> 1:12:30.667
Father!

1:12:33.833 --> 1:12:35.417
Eligos

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:43.498
Crux sacra mihi lux!
Non draco mihi dux!

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:46.123
Gaudeamus igitur.

1:12:46.125 --> 1:12:48.333
Vade retro, Satana.

1:12:49.417 --> 1:12:51.833
Drago sit nihi dux!

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:54.581
Audrey!

1:12:54.583 --> 1:12:55.915
Be strong in the Lord,

1:12:55.917 --> 1:12:57.831
in the strength of His might!

1:12:57.833 --> 1:13:00.790
Put on the full armor of God,
that you may stand strong

1:13:00.792 --> 1:13:03.581
against the schemes
of the evil one!

1:13:03.583 --> 1:13:06.456
Drago non est raga!

1:13:08.542 --> 1:13:09.873
Hold your tongue,

1:13:09.875 --> 1:13:11.792
lest the agent of
God hold it for you!

1:13:15.542 --> 1:13:19.665
For our struggle is not
against flesh and blood,

1:13:19.667 --> 1:13:20.750
but against the rulers,

1:13:21.708 --> 1:13:22.833
against the powers,

1:13:24.708 --> 1:13:26.206
against the world forces
of this present darkness,

1:13:26.208 --> 1:13:28.623
against the spiritual
forces of wickedness

1:13:28.625 --> 1:13:30.665
in the heavenly

1:13:30.667 --> 1:13:32.581
places.

1:13:32.583 --> 1:13:35.706
I know you didn't mean
to kill Caleb or Douglas,

1:13:35.708 --> 1:13:36.831
it was your Mother!

1:13:36.833 --> 1:13:38.540
She made you keep that secret,

1:13:38.542 --> 1:13:40.417
she cut out your
tongue, didn't she?

1:13:44.917 --> 1:13:47.540
Stand firm therefore

1:13:47.542 --> 1:13:49.665
- and gird yourself with truth
- You don't have to do this.

1:13:49.667 --> 1:13:50.956
You could
just let her go.

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:52.248
With the breastplate
of righteousness

1:13:52.250 --> 1:13:54.706
and lifted high above all.

1:13:54.708 --> 1:13:55.915
Let go of her.

1:13:55.917 --> 1:13:57.915
- And shield her faith
- Yes, yes.

1:13:57.917 --> 1:13:59.748
On which
you may extinguish

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:02.750
- all the flaming arrows-
- BEATRICE: Hold your tongue!

1:14:03.708 --> 1:14:06.500
Silence, talk no more.

1:14:13.208 --> 1:14:15.167
We know what you did!

1:14:19.250 --> 1:14:21.206
Devil's spawn.

1:14:21.208 --> 1:14:23.458
Telling secrets.

1:14:25.208 --> 1:14:26.917
They're ours to keep!

1:14:27.958 --> 1:14:30.498
For no one else to know!

1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:31.667
No one to know!

1:14:32.667 --> 1:14:33.542
Sarah!

1:14:38.542 --> 1:14:40.831
See the cross of the Lord;

1:14:40.833 --> 1:14:43.831
begone, ye hostile powers!

1:14:43.833 --> 1:14:45.665
See the cross of the Lord;

1:14:45.667 --> 1:14:48.290
begone, you hostile powers!

1:14:53.208 --> 1:14:56.665
In Nomine
Patris, et Filii,

1:14:56.667 --> 1:15:00.917
et Spiritus Sancti, Amen

1:15:01.833 --> 1:15:02.750
No!

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:05.998
- No!
- Amen!

1:15:35.333 --> 1:15:36.042
Father!

1:15:39.958 --> 1:15:41.665
Father?

1:15:41.667 --> 1:15:42.875
Are they gone?

1:15:54.708 --> 1:15:56.583
A 60-year-old murder?

1:15:57.958 --> 1:15:58.875
Unbelievable.

1:16:00.042 --> 1:16:01.625
Thank you for calling it in.

1:16:03.875 --> 1:16:06.748
Father, I still need to
take your full statement.

1:16:06.750 --> 1:16:07.831
I'll be right
with you, officer.

1:16:07.833 --> 1:16:08.833
Of course.

1:16:14.708 --> 1:16:15.625
Two skeletons.

1:16:16.792 --> 1:16:18.542
Male, pre-teen,

1:16:19.917 --> 1:16:22.542
in a crawl space
behind the altar.

1:16:42.750 --> 1:16:44.331
Okay, yes.

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:47.415
Uh-huh, all right,
that sounds great.

1:16:47.417 --> 1:16:48.665
Yes.

1:16:48.667 --> 1:16:49.583
Bye-bye!

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:53.708
Are you excited
for your road trip?

1:16:54.875 --> 1:16:56.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:16:56.792 --> 1:16:58.123
So?

1:16:58.125 --> 1:16:59.706
Looks like the couple
is still interested.

1:16:59.708 --> 1:17:00.790
So win-win.

1:17:00.792 --> 1:17:01.708
Good.

1:17:03.417 --> 1:17:05.331
Thank you... for everything.

1:17:05.333 --> 1:17:06.956
I don't wanna get emotional.

1:17:06.958 --> 1:17:07.958
My makeup is...

1:17:09.792 --> 1:17:11.831
I'll make sure the movers
do a great job, okay?

1:17:11.833 --> 1:17:12.750
Okay.

1:17:14.042 --> 1:17:14.958
Keep in touch.

1:17:16.958 --> 1:17:19.625
And you guys call me the
moment you get to San Diego.

1:17:20.917 --> 1:17:22.373
Okay.

1:17:22.375 --> 1:17:23.125
Bye.

1:17:25.958 --> 1:17:27.708
Looks like you have a visitor.

1:17:29.958 --> 1:17:31.125
Afternoon, Father.

1:17:32.792 --> 1:17:33.708
Father.

1:17:36.083 --> 1:17:36.958
So,

1:17:38.917 --> 1:17:40.665
the rumors are true.

1:17:40.667 --> 1:17:42.625
Yeah, we're heading back.

1:17:45.417 --> 1:17:46.375
You sure?

1:17:48.083 --> 1:17:49.625
Yeah, it's good.

1:17:50.958 --> 1:17:53.748
A wise man once told me,

1:17:53.750 --> 1:17:55.750
"There's no way
out but through."

1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:58.875
I'd rather live with
the ghosts I know.

1:18:01.167 --> 1:18:02.083
Liz.

1:18:04.167 --> 1:18:05.667
This served me well.

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:10.792
I'd like you to have it, okay.

1:18:12.875 --> 1:18:13.792
Are you sure?

1:18:16.750 --> 1:18:17.792
You never can tell.

1:18:20.500 --> 1:18:22.165
Say goodbye to Father Felix.

1:18:22.167 --> 1:18:23.415
Goodbye Father.

1:18:23.417 --> 1:18:24.167
Goodbye.

1:18:25.750 --> 1:18:26.417
Thank you.

1:18:31.542 --> 1:18:32.208
Thank you.

1:18:38.250 --> 1:18:39.750
You ready to go, honey?

1:18:41.458 --> 1:18:42.792
Can I drive?

1:18:46.042 --> 1:18:48.042
You're pushing it kid.
