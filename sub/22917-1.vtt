Okay. Hey. Ooh.

Shh. I could really use
some help right now. Rodrigo!

-Okay, good.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.536
Uh, Ludwig and Gustav
need another bottle.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.955
And Igor and Wolfgang
need to be changed.

00:37.997 --> 00:40.875
Oh, but I can't, Hai Lai, 'cause
I'm-I'm doing this amazing piece

00:40.916 --> 00:42.668
with these Yanomami musicians.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.378
-You know, it's incredible, eh?
-(babies continue crying)

00:44.420 --> 00:46.672
But I can give you some
of this hallucinogenic powder

00:46.714 --> 00:48.382
-up your nose.
-Okay.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.843
Lift your head. Okay? Ready?

Okay.

01:16.619 --> 01:18.996
I just had
the most intense dream.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.539
What dream?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.042
We had eight babies.
Or maybe there were more.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.627
-There were just
too many to count. -Mm.

You know? I'm sorry, sweetie.
Um, I'll be, I'll be one second.

Let's not do
the "sweetie" thing though,

01:49.902 --> 01:51.153
'cause it reminds me
of my parents, and...

Parents? Yeah.

(speaking French)

02:06.043 --> 02:07.586
Why don't I ever
meet your parents?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.922
Because I don't want you to go
running for the hills just yet.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.174
And I'll just be back
in, like, two days.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.468
-It'll be a really quick trip.
-Guys, I have to hang up.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.679
Yeah. A pretty girl came in.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.680
Yes. Okay?

Bye-bye. Ciao. Bye-bye. Bye.

Mm-hmm.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.020
We've never had sex at 4:00 a.m.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.022
(chuckles) I don't think
that that's possible.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.691
No, we haven't.

02:28.732 --> 02:31.652
They say that 4:00 a.m. sex
is very incredible.

02:31.694 --> 02:35.239
Oh, well, maybe we should do
that before it becomes...

02:35.281 --> 02:37.741
-5:00 a.m. sex.
-Mm, mm. Okay.

-(chuckles)

02:47.626 --> 02:50.254
Did you guys have sex
at, like, 4:00 a.m.?

02:50.296 --> 02:51.755
Yes, we did, Shawn. We did.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.799
It was good.
It was really nice. Thank you.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.217
I didn't know
that you could hear that.

02:55.259 --> 02:57.887
Well, the tuba player next door
could probably hear it,

02:57.928 --> 03:00.389
and he's deaf.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.726
Oh, well, at least there's
one couple here having sex.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.060
I heard that.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.897
Good. I meant for you to.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.398
What is for breakfast?

03:09.440 --> 03:11.400
It's a zucchini flower
frittata--

03:11.442 --> 03:14.320
no flor de calabaza--
and some papaya.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.488
Oh, which you cut
into little musical notes.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.199
RODRIGO: Yes. And some pan dulce
there. And that, which is...

03:19.241 --> 03:21.118
I don't know how to say it
in English. It's zapote.

03:21.160 --> 03:22.870
-I don't know how to say it.
-And I made coffee.

03:22.912 --> 03:25.039
Mmm. I can't keep eating
like this.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.373
-Rodrigo?
-RODRIGO: Yes, Shawn.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.626
-Are you living here now?
-What? -Mm.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.629
-I just asked if your boyfriend
is living here now. -Boyfriend?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.464
-Um... -I've never been called
a boyfriend before.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.716
-This is the first time.
Boyfriend. -Ooh...

03:35.758 --> 03:37.134
(chuckles)

03:37.176 --> 03:39.470
Why would you think
he was living here?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.138
'Cause he's been here
every night this week.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.640
-Which is not a problem.
-No, not at all.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.017
But it's just that I'm a little
short on rent this week,

03:45.059 --> 03:47.061
-and... Sebastian.
-Shawn. -RODRIGO: Rent.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.229
Yeah, I know. It's a crime
to make musicians pay the rent.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.565
-And yet they do.
-Well, uh,

03:51.607 --> 03:53.233
how 'bout I pay the rent
for one year?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.944
-Um... no.
-SHAWN: Oh.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.236
But... Well, why not?

03:56.278 --> 03:57.863
Because you are not
my sugar daddy.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.782
-But you call me "sweetie"
all the time. -I know.

03:59.823 --> 04:00.783
That's different.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.368
You can be my sugar daddy.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.079
-No problem. No problem.
-Stop throwing yourself at him.

congratulations on the review

04:06.538 --> 04:08.332

-Review?

"The New York Symphony
is reaching new heights

04:12.711 --> 04:16.089

04:16.130 --> 04:17.632
"Steadily maturing"?
Give me that.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.259
Thank you, Shawn.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.180
"Steadily maturing."

04:23.222 --> 04:24.598

- Puta madre!

04:26.350 --> 04:27.393
Ay! (stammers) Puta madre.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.769
-HAILEY: Hey. Okay.
-It's bullshit.

04:28.811 --> 04:31.230
-Come back.
-Yeah, yeah.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.690
-It's fine.
-I'm sorry, it's just...

04:32.731 --> 04:34.608
You know,
it's what it is, you know?

04:34.650 --> 04:35.985
The review thing. It's...

04:36.026 --> 04:37.987
It's my problem. It's not yours.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.279
And it's nobody else's.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.614
It's fucking bullshit.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.865
It's good.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.451
Ciao.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.204
Bye, sweetie.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.206
MAN:
Hey, was that...?

04:49.248 --> 04:51.375
Oh, no, it just looks like him.

(violin playing classical music)

05:14.606 --> 05:16.608

05:18.652 --> 05:21.030
Pavel, when is it normal,

05:21.071 --> 05:22.823
in a normal
romantic relationship,

05:22.865 --> 05:24.241
to meet your lover's parents?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.326
I hear rats.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.370
Do you hear rats?

05:31.040 --> 05:33.917
It stopped.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.836
(sighs)

05:35.878 --> 05:38.297
You? You? Bob the Union,
what do you think?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.632
First time I met my wife's
parents was when they came

05:40.674 --> 05:43.761
to help her move her stuff out
of our place during the divorce.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.012
They were really nice.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.388
-Shit.
-(sighs)

05:46.430 --> 05:48.724
Hi, guys! I'm back!

05:48.766 --> 05:50.642
And this is my oboe lesson.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.104
-And this is my oboe teacher,
Hailey. -Hi.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.023
Okay, gang,
so, to play the oboe,

05:56.065 --> 05:58.067
you have to blow really hard
between, like,

05:58.108 --> 06:01.487
these pieces of straw--
let me show you guys--

06:01.528 --> 06:05.240
and it makes your neck puff out
and look horrible.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.577
So, Hailey, why did you want
to be a oboe player?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.454
So I could look horrible.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.749
It was really good, guys.
Really good rehearsal.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.042
-Really good, Bob the Union,
yes. -Thank you.

06:15.084 --> 06:16.043
Hey, what...

06:16.085 --> 06:17.336
Second oboe, second oboe.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.171
Arlen, yes? Yes, man,

06:19.213 --> 06:22.049
I mean, you know,
it's a little bit late.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.926
Oh. Was I? I'm sorry. I...

06:23.967 --> 06:26.011
-I... -No, just, like,
a little bit stiff,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.305
you know?
Like, you were not, like,

06:28.347 --> 06:30.057
playing with the blood,
you know? I do not...

06:30.099 --> 06:31.975
I... With no blood
at all, really.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.227
Like-like a corpse.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.978
Almost like-like a dead man.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.022
You-you were actually playing
like a dead guy.

06:37.064 --> 06:40.317
Oh, God, I'm sorry, Maestro.
I...

06:40.359 --> 06:42.778
But everyone else was
really good. It was really good.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.530
-Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
-Oh, thanks. Thank you, Maestro.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.698
Maestro, I'm just
double-checking that you'll be

06:46.740 --> 06:49.451
at the capital committee meeting
for the building fund today.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.286
(chuckles)
Gloria, come on,

06:51.328 --> 06:53.247
I don't believe
in capital punishment.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.082
What are you talking about?

06:55.124 --> 06:56.917
So you'll be there?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.502
(playing light classical music)

06:58.544 --> 07:00.754
Good. Good.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.423
Masterful. Good.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.093
Watch the flies.
Close your mouth.

07:06.135 --> 07:08.345
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.806
-What the hell is that?
-What?

07:10.848 --> 07:11.807
What-what is this?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.475
I mean, it looks like

07:13.517 --> 07:14.726
you're tickling
an elephant's balls.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.894
It's pure Rodrigo.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.896
Come up with
your own conducting quirks.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.189
What if I don't have any?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.817
Oh, please. Come on.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.569
You know you're a freak.
Stop trying to hide it.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.195
Thank you.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.739
Shit, I didn't know
that I was imitating him.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.741
It's to be expected, isn't it?
I mean, you've spent

07:29.783 --> 07:31.910
half your life looking up at him
from the woodwind section.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.245
You're his drone.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.830
I'm not his drone.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.249
-Take that back.
-Oh, I hit a nerve?

07:37.291 --> 07:40.460
Oh, did you hear back from
the competition in Tokyo yet?

07:40.502 --> 07:42.296
I don't think I'll get in.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.214
"I don't think I'll get in."
Well, I think you will.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.718
And when you do, don't imitate
Rodrigo, who, by the way,

07:47.759 --> 07:50.470
he seems to be
imitating himself these days.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.306
What's that mean?

07:52.347 --> 07:55.309
It means the orchestra
has been playing it fucking safe

07:55.350 --> 07:56.935
ever since he got back
from Italy.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.730
Needs a conductor
with some balls.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.981
Or ovaries.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.566
Big fucking ovaries.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.651
(chuckles)
Come on.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.571
RODRIGO:
Hey, pal. Hey.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.156
Aren't you supposed
to be inside?

08:09.198 --> 08:10.824
-I got kicked out.
-Kicked out?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.284
Kicked out by who?

08:12.326 --> 08:13.744
The motherfucking conductor.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.162
Motherfucking conductor?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.039
Why did he kick you out for?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.082
'Cause I can actually play
and everyone else sucks.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.709
Ah, that's unfair.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.294
That's really unfair, man.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.713
Aren't you a little bit too old
to be smoking?

08:24.755 --> 08:26.256
You mean a little too young?

08:26.298 --> 08:29.259
No, no, no.
I quit when I was 12, Ricky.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.345
How'd you know my name?

08:31.386 --> 08:33.722
I know your name 'cause
you-you know my name, hmm?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.097
-Sure.
-So I...

08:35.140 --> 08:36.892
-Maestro R-Rodrigo.
-(coughs)

08:36.933 --> 08:38.393
The taco guy.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.354
"Delgado's super, super
hard tacos."

08:40.395 --> 08:42.022
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
Stop it. No, yes.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.732
-Tacos, tacos, tacos,
tacos, tacos. -Yes, yes. No, no.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.400
No, no. Really, no, no.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.070
Brings me bad memories,
flashbacks, the horrors.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.113
Yes, well, anyway,
let's-let's go in, let's go in.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.657
Let's see how the orchestra
is doing.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.575
-They suck.
-I know, man, I know,

08:53.617 --> 08:55.786
but, you know, there's this, uh,

08:55.827 --> 08:58.455
superhero called Kalimán,
who used to say...

08:58.497 --> 09:00.457
(speaking Spanish)

09:00.499 --> 09:02.542
Like, serenity and patience.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.586
(playing off-key scales)

09:08.173 --> 09:10.759
I told you they suck.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.470
Yeah. Well, I mean, that-that's
because they're missing

09:13.512 --> 09:15.430
their star percussionist.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.058
Go, go, go. Go over there.
(speaks Spanish)

09:23.563 --> 09:24.940
(music stops)

09:24.982 --> 09:26.441
Maestro, we're getting there.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.819
-Baby steps.
-Yes, yes.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.488
For a baby, a baby step
is just a step.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.823
Right.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.283
I thought I told you to go home.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.118
Unless you're ready to behave?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.745
-If I don't, will you spank me?
-(kids laugh)

09:38.787 --> 09:40.956
Maestro, he's disrupting
the other kids.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.124
RODRIGO:
Just throw a baton at him.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.709
Maestro Rivera used to
do that to me. (grunts)

09:43.750 --> 09:45.460
I'd love to,
but then I'd get arrested.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.712
Well, he ducks...

09:46.753 --> 09:48.463
-Can we talk for a minute?
-Yes.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.008
Okay, Maestro, there's a few
issues we have to deal with.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.342
Issues, issues.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.052
Let's talk about the issues.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.721
The shipment of free violin bows
came in from Dusseldorf,

09:55.762 --> 09:57.139
and they have termites in them.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.432
Shit. What happened
to Dusseldorf?

09:58.473 --> 09:59.933
I used to love Dusseldorf.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.393
And we need to hire
a woodwinds coach.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.353
And the, oh, the brass teacher
took a job in Wisconsin.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.230
What's Wisconsin?

10:05.272 --> 10:07.232
A state. The state of Wisconsin.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.318
Wisconsin is a state?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.820
Wisconsin? Wiscon-Wisconsin.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.864
Wisconsin. I think you're wrong.
I think it's not a state.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.741
The boys' toilet's broken again.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.743
Ah, I'll fix that.
I'll fix that.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.245
We can't keep putting off the
meeting with the school board.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.581
-Mm. -And the kids need lockers
to put their stuff in.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.999
And we need more
practice instruments.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.459
Okay, I have an idea.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.960
Come. Come, follow me.
Follow me.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.754
-(instruments warming up)
-(kids chattering)

10:28.795 --> 10:31.089
Everyone, listen up.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.507
It has come to my attention

10:32.549 --> 10:34.718
that there are several issues
regarding lockers,

10:34.760 --> 10:37.512
school boards, violins...

10:37.554 --> 10:38.847
-Toilets.
-Toilets.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.724
And toilets, yes, toilets.

10:40.766 --> 10:44.311
And I know just the right person
that's gonna solve those issues.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.605
-Gloria?
-No.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.816
Ludwig van Beethoven. Yes.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.361
In two months, the
Maestro Rivera Youth Orchestra

10:52.402 --> 10:54.237
is gonna perform at
August Memorial Hall,

10:54.279 --> 10:56.782
Beethoven's Fifth. Funfte!

10:56.823 --> 10:57.783
(kids cheering)

10:57.824 --> 10:59.242
They can't do that.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.869
Oh, they can, they can.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.496
-No, they can't.
-They need a goal.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.624
They need a... a windmill
to fight against.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.086
Aye. Almost.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.420
Yeah, we can fucking
do this shit.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.505
Eso. Wait.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.423
We can do it,
but stop the language, okay?

11:13.465 --> 11:15.675
Like, it's not cool right now.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.844
I quit.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.513
Okay.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.932
No, you're fired.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.225
I quit.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.851
-No, you're fired.
-Quit.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.895
-Fired.
-I quit.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.355
-He's fired. Fine, fine, fine.
-I quit!

11:28.397 --> 11:31.566
You're fired.
It's fine. Fired.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.985
How many-- We've had, like,
three al-already, no?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.529
-KIDS: Yeah.
-Okay, okay.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.030
Okay, let's go for
the fourth one.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.074
-♪ ♪
-(phone ringing)

11:43.161 --> 11:44.871
-Hi, Cynthia.
-RODRIGO: No.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.123
It's the boyfriend.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.999
HAILEY:
We need to get you a phone.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.376
No, it's not necessary.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.919
W-What are you doing right now?

11:50.961 --> 11:52.963
Just finished playing oboe
for a very sad cat.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.464
What about you?

11:54.506 --> 11:56.341
Would you like to come
to my place for lunch?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.510
-You don't have a place.
-I have a place.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.928
I have a place in a place.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.221
You mean Gloria's place?

12:01.263 --> 12:02.806
I don't know.
Is she there?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.224
No, she's doing
some horrible meeting,

12:04.266 --> 12:05.684
um, something, I don't know.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.519
You want to come?

12:12.566 --> 12:15.694
So you blew off
the capital campaign meeting?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.487
Yes, Hai Lai.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.698
I hate those meetings
about meetings.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.284
Why'd you agree to go
in the first place?

12:22.325 --> 12:24.744
Because I had to, Hai Lai.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.746
I said I would.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.916
But if you don't go, then...

12:29.958 --> 12:32.294
(teakettle whistling)

12:32.335 --> 12:35.338
-I'm gonna make the mate.
-(chuckles)

12:35.380 --> 12:37.382
I'm gonna make the brandy.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.888
(whistling stops)

12:44.890 --> 12:46.558
(door opens)

12:46.600 --> 12:48.268
(Gloria laughs)

12:48.310 --> 12:50.103
All right,
I have a 2:30 meeting.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.688
We have to make this a quickie.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.231
How about two quickies?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.066
Why are you always thinking
about dessert

12:55.108 --> 12:56.651
before you've had
the main course?

12:56.693 --> 12:59.154
Because dessert has tits
like the Venus de Milo,

12:59.196 --> 13:01.114
-only better.
-Ah.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.116
-And arms.
-(Hailey laughs)

13:03.158 --> 13:05.160
What the fuck?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.454
Rutledge? No.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.414
I'd know that insipid titter
anywhere.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.666
-Rutledge?
-Hi.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.127
Ah. Is that my kimono?

13:14.169 --> 13:16.338
No. This is Rodrigo's, actually.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.173
No, they're both Gloria's.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.966
-What are you doing here?
-She lives here.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.260
-Yeah. -And I'm the bloke
that gets to sleep with her.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.803
So put two and two together.

13:23.845 --> 13:28.016
And how long have you two
been playing hide-the-baton?

13:28.058 --> 13:29.643
-Oh, my God. This is mortifying.
-(laughs)

13:29.684 --> 13:32.145
-Just mortifying. -Hey, no, no.
It is not mortifying.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.980
No, there's nothing to be
ashamed of, Hai Lai.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.565
Yes, yes, yes, we've been having

13:35.607 --> 13:37.526
a lot of sexual intercourse
recently.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.736
Because I am the boyfriend.
(slurps)

13:39.778 --> 13:42.197
-That's awful.
-No, Thomas, why?

13:42.239 --> 13:44.491
-Why is it awful?
-(sighs)

13:44.533 --> 13:46.785
Because she is a very promising
young conductor,

13:46.826 --> 13:48.954
trying to make
a name for herself.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.248
Perhaps not the wisest thing
to be having an affair

13:51.289 --> 13:54.167
with an older,
more established conductor.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.378
Older, more established
conduct...

13:56.419 --> 13:58.380
Thomas, that's really offensive.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.466
Well, I just think it's great
and high time.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.843
I've been expecting this
ever since

14:03.885 --> 14:05.470
you dragged her
into my office, saying,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.013
(imitates Rodrigo):
"She plays with the blood."

14:07.055 --> 14:08.807
THOMAS:
Hmm. You think it's great

14:08.848 --> 14:11.560
-that they're shagging
in your apartment? -I do.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.603
And if you ever want
to be shagging

14:13.645 --> 14:17.357
in this apartment again,
you'll behave.

14:17.399 --> 14:18.400
Oh.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.235
Well, congratulations, darlings.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.487
I'm sure it'll
all end swimmingly.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.322
It will.

14:24.364 --> 14:27.659
-See you in 20 minutes.
-Mmm. 30.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.036
Put this on my tab.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.041
Do most conductors suck down
a beer before rehearsals?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.626
Only the promising ones.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.503
Hey, maybe you should bring
your parents back up

14:38.545 --> 14:40.755
with you to New York to visit.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.008
So that I can conduct like...

14:43.049 --> 14:45.594
Okay. I just thought maybe
we could sell a couple tickets.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.679
Look, you know you can always
do a gig here,

14:47.721 --> 14:49.764
but it's mildly depressing
having every Tuesday night

14:49.806 --> 14:50.890
be an empty house.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.392
You think it's depressing?

14:52.434 --> 14:54.185
My boyfriend conducts
the New York Symphony.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.605
Your boyfriend?
He's your boyfriend now?

14:56.646 --> 14:58.106
Yeah. According to him,
he's my boyfriend.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.691
But I think that he actually
doesn't know

14:59.733 --> 15:01.776
what that word means
and just likes to say it a lot.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.069
Anyway, it's not, like, serious.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.238
Are you sure about that?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.199
Yeah. I mean, in Venice,
when he kissed me, I was like,

15:08.241 --> 15:10.118
"You just told La Fiamma
that you love her."

15:10.160 --> 15:12.245
And he was like,
"Oh, yes, and I meant it

15:12.287 --> 15:13.747
"in the moment,
and then there was

15:13.788 --> 15:15.415
another moment
and another moment."

15:15.457 --> 15:17.125
And it's just, like,
that's so Rodrigo.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.336
He's like this emotional
butterfly, and, like...

15:19.377 --> 15:20.962
You're saying "like" a lot.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.672
You only do that when
you're nervous, Hailey.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.050
Yeah. I am nervous.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.093
Why am I so fucking nervous?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.511
Because it's
Rodrigo fucking DeSousa.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.430
Yeah, and I'm
Hailey darn Rutledge.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.723
(chuckles):
Aw.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.058
That's so pathetic.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.268
Hailey darn Rutledge
from down on the farm.

15:35.310 --> 15:36.728
Just don't let him
cut your hair again.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.648
Yeah. No.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.526
Hey, can you stop?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.820
-It's looking good,
it's looking good. -Yeah.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.364
There's no mirror
in front of you.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.407
He wants to meet my parents.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.785
Can you imagine him and my dad
in the same room together?

15:51.826 --> 15:54.496
It would be like Clark Kent
and Superman meeting each other.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.665
(groans)
He's just so famous.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.084
And it never mattered before,
but now it's like...

15:59.125 --> 16:00.794
Now that you rock out
with his cock out.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.379
Yeah, now it's, like,
more complicated.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.089
And Thomas found out,
and he was like,

16:04.130 --> 16:05.674
"Oh, you're ruining
your career."

16:05.715 --> 16:07.717
And-and everyone at the Ferndale
is, like, wondering

16:07.759 --> 16:10.053
-why Rodrigo DeSousa is there
all the time. -(door opens)

16:10.095 --> 16:12.222
No one's wondering.
They know he's there for sex.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.474
-They just don't know with whom.
-Although they suspect

16:14.516 --> 16:16.768
it's the ravishing viola player
on the fifth floor-- you know,

16:16.810 --> 16:19.312
the one with the cheekbones
that could cut diamonds.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.523
-Cheekbones? What cheekbones?
-Fuck you.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.191
LIZZIE:
Anyway, back to ticket sales.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.110
You guys just need
an identity, like,

16:25.151 --> 16:28.113
"Oh, that's the ensemble that
only plays with no pants on,"

16:28.154 --> 16:30.407
or, "Oh, that's the ensemble
that only plays

16:30.448 --> 16:32.325
horror movie soundtracks
with four harps,"

16:32.367 --> 16:34.869
or, "That's the ensemble
that only plays female composers

16:34.911 --> 16:37.038
that all went to jail
for shanking their husbands."

16:37.080 --> 16:38.623
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.208
What, the pant-less ensemble?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.752
Uh, guys, I have something
that I want to discuss.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.713
I know.
My cold sore's coming back.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.715
Why'd I have to be
a flute player?

16:46.756 --> 16:49.426
No, that's not it.
But I'm really sorry, Morgan.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.470
Um, from now on, the
Thundering Toothpicks ensemble

16:52.512 --> 16:54.889
will be exclusively playing
the music

16:54.931 --> 16:57.726
of cutting-edge,
contemporary female composers.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.144
I love that idea.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.770
Oh, well, I loved it first.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.313
Thanks, Sebastian.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.733
Great. Maybe now you guys
can get a new name.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.318
RODRIGO: So, we want
to provide your son Ricky

17:07.359 --> 17:10.113
with some private lessons
from our...

17:10.155 --> 17:13.031
main, main percussionist
at the New York Symphony.

17:13.074 --> 17:15.993
-RICKY'S MOM: You mean him?
-Don't be so skeptical.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.913
-You look like a hippie.
-Uh... I am a hippie.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.623
You're too old
to play percussion.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.083
Mm-hmm.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.044
(playing rapid rhythm)

17:35.221 --> 17:37.098
That was lame.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.101
Now you.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.112
-(spoon clatters to floor)
-Shit!

17:51.154 --> 17:52.655
Hey. Language.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.157
You got some chops, kid.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.242
Yeah, but I don't know
if it's realistic

17:56.284 --> 17:58.286
that he'd be
a professional musician.

17:58.328 --> 18:01.372
Maybe it's realistic, maybe not,
but he does have talent.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.208
-Miss, are you in the orchestra
as well? -I am.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.710
I'll be back as soon as
I recover from a surgery.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.463
So one injury
can screw up your career?

18:08.505 --> 18:10.423
-That's awful.
-DEE DEE: It's not great.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.966
The things we do for love.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.803
Anyway, I have Thursdays
at 6:00 available.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.054
I'm sorry,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.598
he helps out in the restaurant
in the afternoons.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.724
Slave labor.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.434
What if... I can get

18:21.476 --> 18:25.271
a very good replacement for him,
very humble replacement?

18:25.313 --> 18:26.981
M-Meaning who?

18:27.023 --> 18:29.901
-Okay, two mofongos.
-(Latin music playing)

18:29.943 --> 18:30.944
Hey.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.989
-Mofongos.
-I ordered arroz con gandules.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.908
Oh. Okay, okay, yes.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.618
Then the mofongos
are here, right?

18:38.660 --> 18:41.079
Thank you so much
for meeting us up here.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.207
Rodrigo can be a little hard
to pin down sometimes.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.334
That's exactly why
I want to work with him.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.711
Though it's a nice surprise
to meet you, Maestro Pembridge.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.421
THOMAS:
Why, thank you.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.675
I'm just the Executive
Musical Director Extraneous.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.051
Oh, that's nonsense.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.803
Maestro Pembridge
is an integral part

18:56.845 --> 18:59.764
of the symphony team,
and we're all so excited

18:59.806 --> 19:03.059
about collaborating with you
with your new ballet company.

19:03.101 --> 19:06.062
I just loved
your punk Nutcracker.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.398
-And what a success.
-Mm.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.692
-It ran the whole...
-It ran far too long.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.610
Egon. Ah, so nice to meet you.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.862
I can't wait to talk to you.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.613
-But here are the menu first.
-Oh.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.448
-Good.
-Today we have no specials,

19:17.490 --> 19:18.867
because everything is special.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.994
You're working here now?

19:21.035 --> 19:23.079
On Thursdays, yeah,
Thursday afternoon.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.539
He is a man of mystery.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.833
-Like you, Egon.
-Talking about mystery,

19:26.875 --> 19:29.419
what is a... pastelón?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.421
-Pastelón is really good.
-Yeah?

19:31.462 --> 19:34.299
It's got, uh, plantains and...

19:34.340 --> 19:36.885
Well, you know, everything
with plantains is good.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.179
-Yeah. -So, tell us about
this thrilling new project.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.181
It's Ballet for No Audience.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.268
Ballet for a New Audience--
that sounds fantastic.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.020
It's not a ballet
for a new audience.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.605
It's Ballet for No Audience.

19:48.646 --> 19:52.150
Rodrigo, I'd like to work
with you on a modern ballet.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.776
It's a Faust story,

19:53.818 --> 19:57.780
as seen through the character
of a... great conductor.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.326
Oh, man, I love it! I love it.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.911
-Sounds so good. It sounds...
-Really?

20:02.952 --> 20:03.995
-Yes.
-You like Faust?

20:04.037 --> 20:05.163
But-but I-I'm sorry.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.164
But, well, what do...

20:06.205 --> 20:07.790
what do you mean "no audience"?

20:07.832 --> 20:10.501
I just feel the audience
is an outdated concept.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.462
I feel that my success
with Nutcracker

20:12.503 --> 20:17.133
was... was, uh, like a beast
that was suckling me.

20:17.175 --> 20:20.345
It felt like a baby,
and then it felt like a tick.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.055
It was feeding on me. Feeding.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.182
Did it have the face of a pig?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.975
That was chasing you
around the forest?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.728
As you were trying to...
to take your trousers off

20:28.770 --> 20:31.773
and-and trying to eat the mierda
coming out from your ass?

20:31.814 --> 20:34.317
-No, but I love that image.
-That is disgusting.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.737
But the audience is
what we are all doing this for.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.280
You're not a performer.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.074
I beg to differ with you there.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.492
Have you heard her sing?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.410
-Who do you sing for?
-Mm-hmm.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.579
Well, uh, well, him,
mostly, but...

20:46.621 --> 20:49.040
Well, that's a person.
That's not an audience.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.501
-Oh, touché, touché.
-Right?

20:51.542 --> 20:55.004
I just feel an artist is either
looking in or looking out.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.340
It's really hard to do both
at the same time.

20:57.382 --> 21:00.927
You know, it's like a...
a sneeze or... an aneurysm.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.553
It's really good.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.763
-Really?
-Yes.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.264
I love it, man. I love it.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.350
This is really cool. And...

21:07.392 --> 21:09.352
-Order up! -Ah.
Okay, it's a little bit crazy.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.020
I love this a lot.
I love this a lot.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.772
Think about what
you want to drink, okay?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.691
That's so good.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.527
Well, a damn good waiter.

MAN: Raleigh-Durham,
North Carolina. All aboard.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.596
(bus engine idling)

21:56.482 --> 21:57.650
RODRIGO:
Hai Lai!

21:57.692 --> 21:59.444
Hai Lai! Hey.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.863
-Rodrigo... -I was so worried
I was gonna miss you, yes.

22:01.904 --> 22:04.407
-Where... Is this your seat?
-Uh, y-yes.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.242
Okay, take a seat, take a seat.
I want to talk to you.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.077
-I want to talk to you. Sit
down. -Okay. The bus is leaving

22:08.119 --> 22:10.079
-in, like, a minute. So, what?
-No problem.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.998
-I want to meet your parents.
-Why?

22:12.040 --> 22:13.666
Because I'm the boyfriend.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.251
And because it's time,
Hai Lai, it's time.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.420
So, I was doing my shift
at the restaurant.

22:17.462 --> 22:19.756
-What res... What?
-I work at a restaurant now.

22:19.797 --> 22:20.840
Like, a Puerto Rican restaurant.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.300
Anyway, but they came with Egon.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.302
-The choreographer.
-Okay, you know this bus

22:24.343 --> 22:26.304
-is gonna leave really soon.
-I know, I know, I know, I know.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.014
He wants to collaborate with me.
The concept is:

22:28.056 --> 22:29.557
a Ballet for No Audience.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.350
-Incredible, right?
-Mm-hmm.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.852
He said something
about the audience being

22:32.894 --> 22:35.063
an outdated concept,
and how... how the...

22:35.104 --> 22:37.023
you know, the-the audience
is sucking him

22:37.065 --> 22:40.026
or some-some weird stuff,
but when he mentioned that,

22:40.068 --> 22:42.403
I was thinking...
(exhales)

22:42.445 --> 22:45.448
yeah, I don't want to think
about the audience.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.825
I just want to be
with my girlfriend.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.285
Hai Lai.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.707
(chuckles)

22:54.749 --> 22:58.544
Uh, you know that this is a...
ten-hour bus ride?

22:58.586 --> 23:00.379
No, I had no idea.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.090
(Hailey laughs)

23:02.131 --> 23:03.716
It's okay.

23:03.758 --> 23:06.260
If we're together,
it's... it's okay.
