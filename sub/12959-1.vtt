- Look, er...
- I was just about to finish with someone.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.315
- I can come back.
- No, it won't take long.

25:13.395 --> 25:16.485
I'm really glad to see you.
I was hoping that you'd come.

It's incredible.

It truly is.

- This is ridiculous.
- Stay awhile.

25:35.884 --> 25:38.240
I should get these boxes back to the store.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.709
Sarah, there's no need to hurry.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.744
Make yourself a cup of tea.

25:42.824 --> 25:44.951
I suppose. Thank you.

25:45.894 --> 25:47.849
Would you like one?

25:47.929 --> 25:50.185
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

25:50.265 --> 25:51.994
Thank you.

25:52.734 --> 25:54.565
Mr. Rivers, please.

25:58.273 --> 26:02.039
Oh, er... Excuse me. Please, sit here. Sit.

26:05.914 --> 26:09.577

26:10.619 --> 26:11.974
No.

26:12.054 --> 26:15.344
I'm not surprised.
Those that have call us cranks.

26:15.424 --> 26:19.121
E.V.P. stands for

- Well.

26:30.305 --> 26:32.398

26:33.375 --> 26:35.297
I can hear them,

26:35.377 --> 26:38.005

appear visually the first few times.

It took me a few visits to get
used to it but it's addictive.

30:05.987 --> 30:09.787
I'm here all the time. He's really helped me.

30:11.326 --> 30:15.183
I try to help him when I can,
so I keep some of this stuff at the store.

30:15.263 --> 30:17.925
- What store?
- I have a bookstore.

30:22.103 --> 30:25.197

30:27.943 --> 30:29.774
Yeah.

- So what made you come here?
- My fiancé.

30:36.151 --> 30:41.343
He died eight months ago. We've had
trouble deciphering what he's been saying

30:41.423 --> 30:43.357
but this afternoon we cracked it.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.750
Only two words - "Sarah, yes."

30:48.063 --> 30:52.254
Because, before he died, he promised me
that if it was like they say it is

30:52.334 --> 30:54.556
that he would find a way of getting to me

30:54.636 --> 30:57.628
and letting me know that he's happy.

30:58.807 --> 31:01.708
So, "Sarah, yes."

31:02.944 --> 31:04.411
