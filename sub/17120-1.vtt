01:12.440 --> 01:14.920
I still can't believe
Dad didn't kill you for doing that.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.320
Bloody hell, midget,
you shouldn't creep up on people.

01:18.920 --> 01:21.080
Did it hurt? Not really.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.720
Can I have one?

01:24.720 --> 01:26.440
Just go away.

01:26.440 --> 01:28.800
Mum and Dad are going to go mental
if you keep bunking off.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.760
Please, help me.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.600
English?

03:56.600 --> 03:59.200
Can you tell me your name,
please, miss?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.080
Is there someone
we can call for you?

04:05.360 --> 04:08.680
Sophie... Giroux.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.000
Sophie Giroux? Who is that?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.360
Your mother?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.800
Your sister?

04:18.079 --> 04:19.959
Who is Sophie Giroux?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.440
We will try and find her.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.120
Can you please tell me your name?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.480
♪ Oh, my love

04:40.480 --> 04:44.520
♪ We pray each day

04:44.520 --> 04:48.600
♪ May you come home

04:48.600 --> 04:51.400

05:27.680 --> 05:32.080
Niemand ist hoffnungsloser
versklavt als der,

05:32.080 --> 05:35.360
der falschlich glaubt frei zu sein.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.200
Would anybody like to hazard
a translation?

05:41.480 --> 05:44.000
None are more hopelessly enslaved

05:44.000 --> 05:47.280
than those who falsely believe
they are free.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.680
Von Goethe's most famous work
is Faust,

05:55.680 --> 05:58.560
which is about a man
who sells his soul to the devil

05:58.560 --> 05:59.840
in search of power.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.760
Turn your books to chapter three,
please, and start reading.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.240
What's the matter?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.840
I'll finish your lesson, Gemma.
Don't worry.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.560
Mrs Webster,
my name's Sergeant Eve Stone,

06:24.560 --> 06:27.640
I'm with the military police,
5th Investigating Company.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.240
My name is Jorn Lenhart,
I'm with the German police.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.200
I'm sorry, I'm not really sure
how to say this.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.720
Well, is it Sam? Is he OK?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.680
A young woman walked into
Eckhausen yesterday

06:37.680 --> 06:39.400
and collapsed on Lindenstrasse.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.320
She was taken to Hanover Hospital,
where she was operated on overnight.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.160
She's stable now. I don't...
She says her name

06:45.160 --> 06:46.840
is Alice Webster.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.680
What did you say?

08:33.280 --> 08:37.080
If I can't give us honey,
I can at least bring firewood.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.360
Well, you tried, my love.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.960
And failed.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.640
So fail again, fail better...

08:44.640 --> 08:46.080
Ay!

08:46.080 --> 08:47.360
..or simply adapt.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.000
I will get the rest of the wood.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.680
Well, it's been almost a year since
Chalons du Bois, you know?

09:10.680 --> 09:11.760
Sitting around here.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.720
They performed surgery last night.

09:39.720 --> 09:42.080
Another few hours without treatment,
she would have died.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.200
She had a ruptured appendix.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.120
The surgery has left her tired.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.160
She's still recovering
from the anaesthetic.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.120
Dad...?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.600
Look at you.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.680
My little girl.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.480
It's so bright in here.

11:21.680 --> 11:22.840
Alice, love.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.040
Mum?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.800
11 years, we've waited.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.840
I can't believe it.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.520
You haven't changed, Mum.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.720
Neither of you.

11:53.560 --> 11:54.920
I remember when you did that.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.600
In your bedroom.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.120
We were so angry, weren't we?

12:02.880 --> 12:05.800
And then the next week,
you weren't there any more.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.040
And I kept thinking,

12:08.040 --> 12:10.600
"What an awful waste of time,

12:10.600 --> 12:13.720
"to argue over something
so meaningless."

12:18.640 --> 12:21.160
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.960
You don't have to say anything.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.000
You're here now and that's all
that matters, OK?

12:33.920 --> 12:34.960
Hey, Alice.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.320
Is that you, midget?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.360
Not any more.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.760
I'd like to be on my own now.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.560
This is...

13:02.560 --> 13:03.720
it's too much.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.440
OK.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.560
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.480
We'll be right outside, OK?

13:13.480 --> 13:16.600
We'll be just outside that door
if you need anything.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.400
What's happened to her, Sam?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.640
Where the hell has she been?

14:15.360 --> 14:16.600
'Alors, oui?'

14:16.600 --> 14:18.320
Hi, is that Julien Baptiste?

14:18.320 --> 14:20.640
Yes, it is.
'My name's Sergeant Eve Stone,

14:20.640 --> 14:22.160
'I'm with the military police, '

14:22.160 --> 14:25.000
stationed at the garrison
at Eckhausen in Germany.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.760
'Do you know the name
Alice Webster?'

14:28.360 --> 14:29.720
Er, the British girl?

14:31.160 --> 14:34.960
She was abducted... 2003, no?

14:34.960 --> 14:38.320
Yesterday... she came back.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.200
She walked right into the middle
of the town square.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.000
There's a name she mentioned

14:43.000 --> 14:45.640
when the paramedics asked
who they could call.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.000
She said the name Sophie Giroux.

14:49.200 --> 14:50.320
Excuse me?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.760
Sophie Giroux?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.960
I know this all happened
11, 12 years ago,

14:55.960 --> 14:59.680
but you were the lead detective
on her abduction.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.760
We don't know how long it's going to
be until she's well enough to talk,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.560
so I was hoping, in the meantime,

15:05.560 --> 15:07.800
maybe you might like to review
original case files

15:07.800 --> 15:10.000
and see if there was a link
between the two girls.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.600
Do you think the same person
who took her also took Alice?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.720
We think it's likely, yes.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.280
Which would mean there is a chance
we could find Sophie.

15:19.800 --> 15:23.360
Look, I'm retired now,
but I will help you.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.560
Let me look at my files
and see what I can learn.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.680
'Thanks for your time,
Monsieur Baptiste.'

15:29.680 --> 15:31.560
And how is she, the girl?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.760
Alive.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.520
I think this is for me.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.079
Mr Paptees?

17:18.079 --> 17:22.079
No, it's Baptiste,
but it's not important. You are?

17:22.079 --> 17:23.720
Bagir. Bagir.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.640
The car is this way, Mr Baptiste.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.760
How far to Kirkuk?
About one or two hours, maybe.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.080
You must know,
Kirkuk is no place for tourists.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.320
I'm no tourist.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.480
Sam?

18:24.840 --> 18:26.560
Sam, it's nearly nine.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.000
Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.360
You can't be late.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.520
I know.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.600
Matthew's going to go
and visit Alice this afternoon.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.800
I thought maybe we could all go.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.680
I'll try.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.560
Oh, don't strain yourself

19:19.480 --> 19:21.200
You should talk to him.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.320
For all the good it will do.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.080
And how are you sleeping?

19:56.080 --> 19:57.520
Yeah, I'm fine.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.320
I don't know what
I'm expected to do.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.160
You're not expected
to do anything, Sam.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.360
I am, though, aren't I?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.760
Why else would you be
with the head doctor?

20:13.760 --> 20:16.120
You want me to talk about Alice
and all that.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.960
Not unless you want to. I shouldn't
have done what I did, all right?

20:19.960 --> 20:21.440
It was a mistake. But all this

20:21.440 --> 20:23.920
modified assessment crap
is just a waste of time.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.040
Three days a week
stuck behind a desk.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.800
No. I need to be back
with the regiment.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.240
That's not going to happen, Sam,
until I've cleared you.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.480
You know that.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.400
I don't want to talk about her.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.840
Why not?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.560
Monsieur Baptiste.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.800
Mr Anderssen?

21:09.880 --> 21:13.240
Stefan's fine. Well, then,
call me, Julien, please.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.480
Thank you for meeting me.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.600
I'm not the one who travelled
over 1,000 miles to be here.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.280
Monsieur Baptiste... Julien.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.160
Julien, I'm not quite sure
why you wanted to meet me.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.560
You didn't give much away
in your e-mail.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.720
Can we go inside?
I am not used to the heat.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.920
I'm looking for someone.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.080
What's this about? Two girls kept
prisoner in a basement

21:45.080 --> 21:46.400
for more than ten years.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.200
Sophie Giroux and Alice Webster.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.920
I must find this man.
I need to track him down.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.880
So what's this got to do with me
here?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.840
I need to find someone
to drive me from here to Azwai.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.600
Crossing the border into Iraq

22:02.600 --> 22:05.120
is a pretty good way
to get yourself killed.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.160
Says the man who's done it
many times.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.920
You have done your research.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.320
Of course. I read your articles.

22:13.320 --> 22:17.160
I admire your writing,
and, uh... your courage.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.600
Julien, please understand...

22:18.600 --> 22:22.120
I must find this man.
Look, I choose what risks I take.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.120
I do not take them lightly but,
when I do, they're mine alone.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.880
You're married, right?
You have a family?

22:29.880 --> 22:31.240
Yes.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.720
What do I tell them
if you don't come back?

22:37.800 --> 22:40.240
How do I explain
that I risked taking someone

22:40.240 --> 22:43.320
with no experience of the region,
with no real planning,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.640
into the Iraqi desert right between
two groups of people

22:46.640 --> 22:50.160
whose sole ambition in this life
is to kill one another?

22:53.480 --> 22:55.520
You could tell them
you had two choices,

22:55.520 --> 22:57.320
to do nothing, or to do something.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.880
I could go home.
You could go home.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.480
The people involved in the conflict,

23:01.480 --> 23:04.280
they could all decide to go home
and forget their troubles,

23:04.280 --> 23:06.000
but they don't.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.760
They continue to walk
towards the storm,

23:07.760 --> 23:10.720
to plant apple trees, whilst
the world burns down around them.

23:12.480 --> 23:16.080
So... to do nothing, to do something?

23:16.080 --> 23:18.000
What choice is that?

23:18.000 --> 23:19.640
It's no choice at all.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.760
I'm sorry. Contrary to what
you might think about me,

23:29.760 --> 23:31.800
risks are the last thing
I want to take.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.360
I really am sorry.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.480
I'm going to Azwai.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.200
With your help, or without it.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.040
Thank you for your time.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.440
Aram Askari.

23:59.640 --> 24:03.760
I won't take you, but Askari is a
fixer the Reuters guys swear by.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.800
He runs a place
called Sunshine Travel.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.840
They have an office right
by the citadel.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.120
You can't miss it.
I've never worked with him.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.600
My guys are out of the country, so I
can't vouch if he's any good myself.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.760
Aram Askari. Mm-hm.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.600
Thank you.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.920
Hello. 'Celia, mon amour.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.480
'Celia?'

24:45.480 --> 24:47.360
Are you calling to say that you've

24:47.360 --> 24:49.720
made a mistake and you're
getting back on that plane?

24:49.720 --> 24:52.520
Je t'en pris, mon coeur,
s'il te plait.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.320
Are you?

24:54.320 --> 24:57.000
I must see this through. I must find
the man who took those girls.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.720
'Tu sais combien
c'est important pour moi.'

24:59.720 --> 25:02.160
Then we don't have anything
to talk about.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.040
'Celia, please...'

25:24.040 --> 25:27.000
Aram Askari?
Aram is out on a tour.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.600
I'm Yardil.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.520
I was told to ask for Mr Askari.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.160
He's my brother.
We own this place together.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.840
Perhaps I can help.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.080
I wish to travel to Azwai.

25:46.080 --> 25:47.280
It is not safe.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.840
But it can be done.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.400
5,000.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.520
5,000? This is non-negotiable.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.680
I have only dinars.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.520
The border guards will only look
the other way for dollars.

26:09.240 --> 26:11.200
There's a bank not far from here.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.880
If you turn right,
it's a few hundred metres down.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.360
When do we leave?
It is just you and I?

26:19.400 --> 26:20.560
We can leave this afternoon.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.000
Are you going to share that?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.240
Sorry.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.760
When's he coming?
He's 15 minutes late.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.760
Drug dealers do not keep
to a schedule, Matty.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.560
Jesus...

27:02.720 --> 27:04.000
Oi!

27:11.560 --> 27:13.200
What do you think you're doing?!

27:14.160 --> 27:15.960
Where you going?

27:15.960 --> 27:18.040
Come on! Where you going?

27:18.040 --> 27:20.240
Where the hell are you going?

27:20.240 --> 27:22.560
Come on! Open the door!

27:22.560 --> 27:24.360
Bitch!

27:51.160 --> 27:53.200
Hey, Matthew, it's just mum.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.600
We were going to go and see
your sister this afternoon.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.240
And, uh... I know you usually
go on your own, but...

28:02.520 --> 28:05.880
..well, I thought it might be nice
to all go together, if you...

28:07.160 --> 28:08.600
Well, let me know what you think.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.960
All right, bye. Bye.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.880
After the van stopped,

28:56.880 --> 28:58.800
he opened the door

28:58.800 --> 29:01.240
and he put a bag over my head.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.320
It was a...

29:06.760 --> 29:09.160
..a dark plastic bag.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.320
I couldn't see.

29:13.560 --> 29:14.840
I couldn't breathe.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.400
Every time I screamed,
I sucked the...

29:19.640 --> 29:21.280
..plastic into my throat.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.040
He put me...

29:28.400 --> 29:30.600
..over his shoulder
and he carried me.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.560
I felt him tie my hands
behind my back.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.840
He told me...

29:42.920 --> 29:46.600
.."If you do what I say, I'll take
you back to your mum and dad."

29:49.080 --> 29:51.120
And this was the man who kept you?

29:52.160 --> 29:53.720
And he spoke in English?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.280
Did he have an accent?

30:02.520 --> 30:03.880
Yes, he's German.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.840
Did you ever see his face?

30:08.240 --> 30:09.520
Can you describe him?

30:10.760 --> 30:12.840
I said...

30:12.840 --> 30:14.280
.. "Please, take me home."

30:15.480 --> 30:17.760
He told me to stop crying,
but I couldn't.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.320
So he hit me.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.920
Love, you can stop this
whenever you want.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.520
He hit me twice.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.520
And then he pulled down my skirt

30:30.520 --> 30:33.760
and that was the first time
that he raped me.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.120
He hugged me after.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.400
Just put both of his arms around me.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.200
And he stroked my hair.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.560
He told me he'd always be my first.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.360
Alice...

31:37.360 --> 31:40.640
when the paramedics picked you up,
you mentioned Sophie Giroux.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.640
You were asking for her.

31:45.840 --> 31:46.960
I don't remember.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.080
Do you have any idea

31:50.080 --> 31:51.720
where she might be right now?

31:57.520 --> 31:59.440
She was so weak.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.160
He hadn't fed her...

32:03.200 --> 32:04.640
..in ages.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.720
I promised that I'd come back
for her.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.560
Sophie...

32:51.360 --> 32:54.320
- Guten Morgen. Sprechen Sie Englisch?
- Mm-hm.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.720
I'm looking for Alice Webster.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.560
I have no patient in that name.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.880
Please spell for me.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.640
Um... I think I've made a mistake.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.400
Forgive me. Thank you.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.080
Sorry to intrude.
This is Karla Becker.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.960
She's a clinical psychologist
here in Hannover.

33:28.960 --> 33:32.400
The doctors contacted me when they
heard the nature of this case.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.960
I'll be providing the counselling
your daughter will need.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I'll speak with her every day.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.560
It will take time,
we cannot rush such a thing.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.280
But... there is something
you should know.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.520
The doctors performing
the appendectomy,

33:47.520 --> 33:48.960
they found stretch marks.

33:50.280 --> 33:52.280
And there are other
clear indications

33:52.280 --> 33:54.000
that your daughter has given birth.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.240
No!

33:57.200 --> 33:58.840
No! No!

33:58.840 --> 34:00.080
No!

35:04.920 --> 35:07.440
We'll head back to camp
and brief the Brigadier.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.480
We need to organise
a thorough debrief later today.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.280
Excuse me. Bonjour.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.400
Are you Sergeant Stone?

35:15.400 --> 35:16.880
Who's asking?

35:18.040 --> 35:19.640
Julien Baptiste.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.360
How far along are you?

35:23.360 --> 35:25.720
Seven months, I would guess.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.720
Eight. I think it's a girl.

35:27.720 --> 35:28.760
No?

35:30.640 --> 35:34.400
What are you doing here?
I thought you were retired?

35:34.400 --> 35:37.000
The receptionist had no record
of Alice Webster.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.120
And since I see no journalists,

35:40.120 --> 35:43.000
I must presume the girl's return
has been kept secret.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.480
The last thing that girl needs
is any more stress.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.320
Of course. But there's only so long
the flow of police

35:49.320 --> 35:51.720
into this hospital
can go unremarked upon.

35:51.720 --> 35:55.320
Look, I wish nothing but peace
for the girl.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.240
I asked you to look into
the Giroux case file,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.520
not come out to Germany.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.280
I'm only asking to speak with her.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.760
She's too unwell to have
more people questioning her.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.120
But she has spoken, no?

36:12.880 --> 36:16.000
She did confirm she was held captive
with Sophie Giroux.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.480
Sophie?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.000
Where were they kept?
They were moved around.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.560
All Alice remembers
is being in the forest.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.400
She walked hours
until she found the road.

36:26.400 --> 36:27.720
Where, exactly, she's not sure.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.200
Was there a yellow van mentioned
in Alice's abduction?

36:31.200 --> 36:33.400
That was the only clue we had
in Sophie's case.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.120
Baptiste, I've said enough already.

36:35.120 --> 36:39.080
Look, I don't want to interfere
with your investigation,

36:39.080 --> 36:42.160
but I made the parents
of Sophie Giroux a promise.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.760
There is no-one who knows that case
better than I.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.080
You looked me up, Sergeant.

36:52.240 --> 36:55.560
You know who I am
and what I've done. Let me help.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.640
I appreciate you making the trip,
but it's not necessary.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.320
Go home, Mr Baptiste.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.920
4,700,

37:11.920 --> 37:13.200
4,800,

37:13.200 --> 37:14.960
4,900,

37:14.960 --> 37:16.040
5,000.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.360
Thank you. You're welcome.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.400
Pardon.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.480
Are we going, then?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.920
Oh, well, great, you're coming.

39:22.920 --> 39:25.000
Dad isn't back yet. So?

39:26.200 --> 39:28.760
Well, I just thought
we could all go together.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.040
Do you want to go see Alice?
I'm here. Let's go.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.680
Well...

39:51.600 --> 39:53.240
I can't keep coming around.

39:53.240 --> 39:54.760
Then, don't.

39:57.200 --> 40:00.240
Maybe we should get a hotel
next time.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.200
Sure. You know, it'd just be easier,
that's all.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.640
You should go. Yeah, I'm going
to go shower first.

42:28.560 --> 42:31.000
So, you have the money? I do.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.120
But first, I want you
to do something for me.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.160
Pick up the phone
and call your brother.

42:35.160 --> 42:38.760
From what I can tell,
he runs an honest business here.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.720
You should apologise for muddying
his good name by trying to rob me.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.000
What are you talking about?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.320
You send me to the bank to withdraw
a large amount of money

42:45.320 --> 42:47.240
and moments later
I'm being followed?

42:47.240 --> 42:48.920
You think all of us are thieves?

42:48.920 --> 42:51.120
I'm simply saying things
as I see them.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.680
Take your money, take your damn
money and get out of my office.

42:55.680 --> 42:58.280
If you were followed,
it wasn't by me or anybody I know.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.480
So whatever you're mixed up in,
I want no part of it.

43:00.480 --> 43:02.560
Get out! Go!

43:03.760 --> 43:04.840
Go!

43:35.200 --> 43:36.600
Why aren't you coming down?

43:38.360 --> 43:39.880
No. Sorry.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.080
Do you see the way he looks at me?

43:46.440 --> 43:47.880
He's still not forgiven me.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.040
Well...

43:50.040 --> 43:51.560
he hasn't forgiven himself.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.000
Come on, Sam.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.520
I'm sorry.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.120
'Hey.' Mrs Webster, I said I'd call
when I arrived.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.800
Do you really think you're going
to find something out there?

44:20.840 --> 44:23.560
Well, I wouldn't have come
if I didn't.

44:25.000 --> 44:26.040
'No, I know.'

44:26.040 --> 44:28.960
Look, I want to believe you,
it's just hard.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.800
Are you still doing what I asked,
with the photographs?

44:33.800 --> 44:35.680
'Yeah, when I can.'

44:36.880 --> 44:39.600
'If my family knew what I was doing,
they'd think I'd lost my mind.'

44:40.560 --> 44:43.520
But, yeah, I am. 'You have not
lost your mind, Mrs Webster.'

44:46.360 --> 44:50.880
Do you ever feel like your family
are just... slipping away from you?

44:50.880 --> 44:52.280
All the time.

44:52.280 --> 44:55.800
We feel that way only because
we want to hold them so close.

45:25.800 --> 45:27.720
I haven't forgotten, Alice.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.000
I haven't forgotten
what I promised you.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.840
Monsieur Baptiste.

45:54.280 --> 45:55.800
How did it go?

45:57.680 --> 46:00.000
I was followed
when I went to the bank.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.200
Ah...!

46:03.600 --> 46:05.800
Someone hoping to steal from me.

46:08.240 --> 46:11.160
I thought, perhaps, I was set up,
but now...

46:11.160 --> 46:12.840
I'm not so sure.

46:15.640 --> 46:19.640
I usually like to try and think
the best of people.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.000
The trouble is...

46:22.360 --> 46:24.320
..people continue to disappoint me.

46:31.200 --> 46:32.880
I'll do it.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.040
I'll take you to Azwai.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.640
What changed your mind?

46:39.640 --> 46:42.000
I thought about what you said,
and you were right.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.840
I'm here to file stories, and you,
Monsieur Baptiste, you have a...

46:46.040 --> 46:48.080
..well, you have a habit
of finding them.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.600
If I didn't follow you,
I wouldn't be doing my job.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.520
Well, then, that's why I like
to put my faith in people.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.480
Good. Give me a couple of weeks
to put it together.

46:59.480 --> 47:01.120
It has to be sooner.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.040
How soon? Tomorrow morning.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.440
No, no, no, I need to...

47:07.440 --> 47:10.600
I need to ask for the best route,
find out where the troops are,

47:10.600 --> 47:12.960
get a good fixer...
I may not have weeks.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.560
I have a brain tumour.

47:16.600 --> 47:19.120
You're looking at a... dying man.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.880
I'm sorry.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.080
You have nothing to be sorry for.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.520
You didn't put it there.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.760
Can you take me tomorrow?

47:33.960 --> 47:35.800
OK. Erm...

47:35.800 --> 47:36.880
let me make some calls.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.800
First, though, who exactly
is this man we're looking for?

47:46.440 --> 47:49.320
The former soldier, Daniel Reed.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.360
Henry Reed was a soldier, yes...

48:00.400 --> 48:01.480
..but a father first.

48:02.760 --> 48:06.480
He leaves behind his son, Daniel,
who followed him into the service.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.760
We'll never know why Henry
took his own life,

48:10.760 --> 48:13.080
but we can remember the good he did.

48:47.680 --> 48:51.200
We need to get her some clothes.
She's coming home with us tonight.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.720
Tonight?

48:53.720 --> 48:55.160
Well, that's...

48:57.040 --> 48:59.400
There's no rush, love. I mean...

48:59.400 --> 49:01.040
we can stay here
as long as you need.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.040
What I need is to come home.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
I've spoken to the doctors,
it's fine.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.840
It's just an appendix operation,
routine, one night is easily enough.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.600
Sam, she needs help.

49:09.600 --> 49:11.320
Other help that we can't give her.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.360
Shrinks will come to us every day.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.240
You know, she's made up her mind.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.960
She's given the police
everything they need.

49:17.960 --> 49:20.240
She needs to be somewhere safe.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.840
She's been through enough.
It's time she came home.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.720
Where she belongs.

49:26.840 --> 49:30.120
The Photofit is being sent to every
single police station in Germany,

49:30.120 --> 49:32.840
it will be with every newspaper
by the evening edition.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.240
And we're not issuing

49:34.240 --> 49:36.400
Alice Webster's name along with it,
are we?

49:36.400 --> 49:38.560
What do you take us for,
Major Gettrick?

49:38.560 --> 49:41.040
If we're going to keep
Alice Webster's identity withheld

49:41.040 --> 49:43.160
as long as possible,
we need a consistent strategy.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.440
Your department deals
with local politics,

49:45.440 --> 49:47.120
community relations,
not abductions.

49:47.120 --> 49:50.480
Alice Webster's identity will break
at some point, that's inevitable.

49:50.480 --> 49:54.800
We can spare her and her family the
intrusion for as long as possible

49:54.800 --> 49:56.840
if we work together.

49:56.840 --> 49:58.400
Now, this Photofit,

49:58.400 --> 50:02.120
I have over 5,000 men and women
in this garrison ready to help.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.440
Thank you, Brigadier. I have support
from Hanover, the matter is in hand.

50:06.640 --> 50:08.360
You were here, weren't you?

50:08.360 --> 50:11.200
When the girl was taken, you were
a detective on the case? Yes.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.680
Then you saw how it shook
this whole damn place.

50:13.680 --> 50:17.560
And I watched as Army and Polizei
butted heads time and again

50:17.560 --> 50:18.920
over who was bloody in charge.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.440
Let us not forget
that, while we argue,

50:21.440 --> 50:24.000
Sophie Giroux
is still out there somewhere.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.560
And you and I, now,

50:26.560 --> 50:29.320
we are in a position
to do something about this.

50:33.200 --> 50:35.720
You're right, Brigadier.
You're right.

50:35.720 --> 50:39.320
With your help, we can begin
the search immediately.

50:40.360 --> 50:41.480
OK, then.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.360
You think he means it?
About working together?

50:47.360 --> 50:49.040
He can be a stubborn bastard, Engel,

50:49.040 --> 50:50.600
but he's got his head screwed on.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.640
He knows how important
a case like this is.

50:52.640 --> 50:55.200
You should really be
on leave by now,

50:55.200 --> 50:58.640
not stuck in the middle of something
like this. I'm fine, Dad. I know.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.720
But your sister would have killed me
for not at least saying it.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.560
Have you told her?

51:06.760 --> 51:08.120
I will. Dad...!

51:08.120 --> 51:09.200
I will.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.200
It's my job to worry about you,
remember, not the other way around.

51:38.560 --> 51:41.000
Sophie! Sophie!

51:41.000 --> 51:42.560
Sophie!

53:06.040 --> 53:08.440
I'll... I'll put the kettle on.

53:18.280 --> 53:21.440
I understand... you don't want...

53:24.280 --> 53:26.240
The doctor said...

53:26.240 --> 53:30.560
Well, they said that there were
signs that you'd had a baby.

53:33.800 --> 53:36.080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.800
Do you want something to eat, or...?

53:44.800 --> 53:46.200
No, I'm tired.

53:49.080 --> 53:50.120
Yeah, of course.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.000
We kept all your things.

54:36.960 --> 54:40.000
Every Christmas,
we wrote you a letter,

54:40.000 --> 54:42.160
to... well, wherever you were...

54:45.400 --> 54:48.960
..letting you know
what we were doing that year.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.880
Well, they're here,
if you want them.

54:59.280 --> 55:01.000
Is it OK if I...

55:02.240 --> 55:04.480
..if I give you a hug?

55:06.920 --> 55:08.720
Of course you can.

55:29.480 --> 55:31.120
Night, love.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.360
Mum...

55:38.360 --> 55:39.760
Yeah?

55:42.360 --> 55:44.320
Night.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.640
Night-night.

56:46.520 --> 56:49.040
When Alice Webster returned,

56:49.040 --> 56:51.960
I remember, people, they said,

56:51.960 --> 56:54.240
"Finally, she is free."

56:55.240 --> 56:57.960
"Free s a bird," you know?

56:59.280 --> 57:01.040
I never understood that saying.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.080
People think birds are these
free creatures flying around

57:05.080 --> 57:08.320
without a care in the world,
and yet,

57:08.320 --> 57:11.200
they build their nests high up
in the trees

57:11.200 --> 57:13.560
to protect themselves
from predators.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.720
Nobody is free in this world.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.080
That girl who came back...

57:32.360 --> 57:35.840
..after all those years
kept in a basement...

57:44.760 --> 57:48.080
..she wasn't free
when she left that place.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.360
She was still a prisoner.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.440
But...

58:02.440 --> 58:04.600
most importantly, I believe...

58:09.880 --> 58:11.200
..that girl...

58:14.200 --> 58:16.120
..was not Alice Webster.
