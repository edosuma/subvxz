00:59.358 --> 01:01.993
<i>They did this experiment in England once.</i>

01:03.528 --> 01:06.530
<i>A group of people were told
that for the following few weeks...</i>

01:06.610 --> 01:10.497
<i>...hired strangers would be interfering
ever-so-slightly in their lives.</i>

01:11.672 --> 01:16.340
<i>Nothing they would normally notice,
maybe a passerby on a bicycle...</i>

01:16.420 --> 01:18.654
<i>...or a waiter at a restaurant.</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:22.880
<i>Just little interactions set up
to alter the course of their routines.</i>

01:26.486 --> 01:28.321
<i>When the study was finished...</i>

01:28.401 --> 01:31.878
<i>...the volunteers recounted
all the things that had happened to them.</i>

01:33.189 --> 01:37.128
<i>And some of them were seriously affected
by the message they were being sent.</i>

01:38.883 --> 01:41.567
<i>One woman started believing in God.</i>

01:42.770 --> 01:44.805
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

01:44.885 --> 01:46.586
<i>Nothing was done to them.</i>

01:47.207 --> 01:50.374
<i>Their lives had carried on
completely unchanged.</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:54.052
<i>The only thing altered was their perception.</i>

01:58.351 --> 02:00.398
<i>People see what they're looking for.</i>

02:11.798 --> 02:14.422
I'm gonna drum roll until
you finish setting up the camera.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.657
Make you go faster. Come on.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.483
- Okay.
- You done? You done?

02:18.563 --> 02:23.364
September 18th, 2014, terms
and conditions of the experiment.

02:23.444 --> 02:27.368
Rule one, no physical interference
with the subject at any time.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.830
Electronic and mechanical equipment only.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.340
Rule two, strict deadline.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.309
Six weeks to prove hypothesis
or the project is abandoned.

02:35.389 --> 02:40.081
Rule three, objectivity.
No trick editing, no false narrative...

02:40.161 --> 02:43.751
...everything that you will witness
will be 100 percent real.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.978
The theory, simply put...

02:46.058 --> 02:50.058
...with the proper execution it is possible
to drive an unsuspecting person...

02:50.138 --> 02:53.561
...into believing that they are
truly being haunted.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.319
Now in our case, the unsuspecting
person Is Harold Grainey...

02:57.399 --> 03:00.709
<i>...the creepy, psycho hermit,
that lives across the street.</i>

03:01.084 --> 03:04.692
<i>We have reason to believe that something
strange is going on in that house.</i>

03:04.772 --> 03:08.442
Now the goal is to document the entire thing.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.610
Say, "Hi, Sean."

03:11.037 --> 03:15.082
- Dude, I'm not in this.
- Posterity, remember, this is the process.

03:15.162 --> 03:19.687
We have to document everything,
and everything includes shopping... right?

03:19.767 --> 03:24.091
This is Mr. Sean Turner,
residence surveillance expert.

03:24.171 --> 03:28.629
MIT-Bound-Mastermind, voted most
likely to invent the next Facebook.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.873
Say hi to the kids at home, Sean.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.701
Hi, kids.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.880
Tell them exactly what it is
we're doing here.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.041
We are purchasing the last of our supplies.

03:40.121 --> 03:44.287
- And supplies for...
- For the surveillance room.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.648
- Surveillance headquarters.
- I.E. your bedroom.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.885
Why don't you show everybody
what's in your basket?

03:50.965 --> 03:52.562
Well?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.791
All right, fine, here, take this.

03:56.871 --> 04:01.796
All right, just checking
the color contrast, there we go.

04:01.876 --> 04:05.288
Stunning quality... absolutely stunning.

04:06.548 --> 04:10.972
Oh, man, great idea, Sean,
spray painting indoors.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.998
Why don't you give everybody the run-down.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.591
Well, in order to fully surveil
someone's house undetected...

04:21.671 --> 04:24.084
...with real-time audio and video...

04:24.164 --> 04:26.187
...you need a high-speed Internet feed...

04:26.267 --> 04:30.949
...and you need a few stealthy gadgets
that are surprisingly easy to acquire...

04:31.029 --> 04:33.194
...in fact, all of these came from Skymall.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.993
God bless America!

04:35.073 --> 04:37.531
Selling terrorist-grade spy
equipment on an airplane.

04:37.611 --> 04:42.803
Exactly. This is a motion-sensor
adhesive mini cam.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.673
It's WIFI-enabled, you can stick it
to pretty much anything...

04:45.753 --> 04:49.660
...it's like the same thing that the D.A.
uses for undercover drug busts.

04:49.740 --> 04:53.881
This is a 2.4 GHz mounted thin cam.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.849
It's controlled from a remote...

04:56.929 --> 05:00.558
...it has zoom aperatures,
and night vision capabilities.

05:00.638 --> 05:04.752
As for the disturbances themselves,
these are pulse-control magnets...

05:04.932 --> 05:07.738
...electronic wire trips, fuse rerouters...

05:07.818 --> 05:10.718
...this big guy here
is a low-range Sonic emittor.

05:10.898 --> 05:15.446
These are ultra-range wireless audio bugs.

05:15.526 --> 05:19.040
Now all together, it's enough
to control someone's lights...

05:19.120 --> 05:21.242
...and home electronics from your fingertips.

05:21.322 --> 05:26.046
We route all of this together
into mission control.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.024
Here, take this.

05:29.029 --> 05:34.011
All right, so, we have three
monitors, four hard drives...

05:34.091 --> 05:37.758
...one steady vantage point
to watch us watching the subject.

05:37.838 --> 05:43.031
And of course, our beautiful eye
in the sky, an objective witness cam.

05:43.111 --> 05:46.302
This set up has cost us a lot of time.

05:46.382 --> 05:48.384
A lot of Sean's father's money...

05:48.464 --> 05:51.768
...coming fully equipped
with a digital editing bay.

05:51.848 --> 05:56.413
This is truly what's going to
make this a goddamn masterpiece.

05:59.958 --> 06:01.814
This thing got fucked up.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.895
Fascinating.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.523
How are you doing?

06:09.003 --> 06:11.682
I'm done. It's good to go.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.835
All right, it is 8:40 am,
Saturday, September 19th.

06:21.915 --> 06:26.061
Our street cam is in position and our subject
is on his way to his weekly grocery run...

06:26.141 --> 06:31.012
...so that means for the next hour
and a half that house is ours.

06:31.092 --> 06:32.981
All right.

06:33.061 --> 06:36.312
And there he goes. Okay, let's do this.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.076
All right, go, go, go!

06:45.338 --> 06:47.775
- You good, dude?
- Yeah.

06:47.855 --> 06:50.560
Okay, let's go, come on.

07:02.789 --> 07:06.380
Hey, dude! The ladder, get the ladder.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.557
Let's go, come on.

07:11.297 --> 07:13.510
Dude, go! Come on.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.896
All right, this place is fucking creepy.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.204
Ethan, you want to make yourself useful?

07:25.284 --> 07:28.843
- I am, I'm talking with you.
- Hurry up!

07:31.818 --> 07:33.897
Sweet record player, Grainey.

07:37.555 --> 07:41.189
I guess that means no basement cam. Oh, shit!

07:41.394 --> 07:43.258
Stupid fucking cat.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.490
What?

07:49.570 --> 07:53.850
Well, all right, extreme home makeover time.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.651
- Is it on?
- Yeah, but we gotta hide it better.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.017
Relax, it's fine.

08:52.097 --> 08:55.389
No, it's not, okay. And we gotta get out
of here. I still have to plant the audio.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.925
Hey! Relax, it's gonna work.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.928
All right, I will work on this,
you finish up.

09:01.008 --> 09:04.094
Hey, Sean, it's gonna be fine.

09:15.021 --> 09:19.513
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you
Exhibit C, the living room cam...

09:19.593 --> 09:23.364
...the camera that ultimately
captured the tragedy.

09:23.444 --> 09:28.221
And this is clip number one,
September 19th, 2014.

09:28.301 --> 09:32.102
The first day of the so-called
"haunting project."

09:33.707 --> 09:35.829
The haunting project?

09:35.909 --> 09:38.899
- For lack of a better title.
- Yeah, for lack of a much better title.

09:38.979 --> 09:43.070
All right, seriously, and you guys
can just do all that stuff from this room?

09:43.150 --> 09:45.205
It's brilliant, actually, I mean...

09:45.285 --> 09:49.142
...I don't think that anybody
has ever done anything quite like this.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.280
- Except that they have.
- Okay, explain.

09:53.360 --> 09:58.787
Okay, how about a million movies
and TV shows?

09:59.301 --> 10:04.195
I mean, like scare tactics,
paranormal whatever, it's the same shit.

10:04.275 --> 10:06.159
Ashley, I...

10:06.259 --> 10:09.530
...I don't think you fully
understand the scope of the project.

10:09.610 --> 10:12.566
I mean, we're not punking somebody here.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.903
We're driving them
to question their own beliefs.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.340
I mean, this is real, right?

10:19.420 --> 10:23.688
- Only it's not real, it's bullshit.
- No, Sean, help her out, okay?

10:23.768 --> 10:25.633
Give her the scoop.

10:25.713 --> 10:28.514
What you're talking about is fiction.

10:29.078 --> 10:32.006
What people think, people would do...

10:32.086 --> 10:34.839
...when confronted
by a supernatural presence.

10:34.919 --> 10:36.673
Set up cameras...

10:36.753 --> 10:40.194
...call a psychic,
but would anyone actually do that?

10:40.274 --> 10:45.899
Short of an actual ghost being
in the house, this is as real as it gets.

10:45.979 --> 10:50.371
Come on, every great filmmaker
takes their own next step.

10:50.451 --> 10:54.074
And this is my next step.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.778
So, you're gonna torture some
poor old man, that's the next step?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.269
Ashley, the fact that you just said that...

11:00.349 --> 11:02.851
...proves to me that you have
no idea who Grainey is.

11:02.931 --> 11:06.416
- Okay, well, what does that mean?
- It means Harold Grainey is an asshole.

11:06.496 --> 11:08.170
Yeah, he's a psychopath.

11:08.250 --> 11:13.026
He's bat-shit crazy. I mean,
he beat his wife until she left.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.196
Yeah, and now he just sits in the house
all day, drinking himself to death.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.825
Yelling at anybody who bothers him.

11:17.905 --> 11:23.113
Because he doesn't let kids in his yard,
you're gonna scare an old man half to death?

11:23.193 --> 11:25.447
Trust me, he deserves it.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.363
Why?

11:28.988 --> 11:33.113
- I'm not gonna get into it.
- But there's other shit, too.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.116
He used to call the cops on us
all the time, even as kids.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.779
And didn't he poison the Lindeman's dog?

11:38.859 --> 11:41.589
- Yes, yes, he did.
- And he watches people.

11:41.669 --> 11:44.731
Yeah, he is an old, miserable...

11:44.811 --> 11:48.027
...wife-beating, dog-killing,
drunk sack of shit.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.431
I mean, I for one, am not
gonna lose any sleep over this.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.834
Well, what do you mean he watches people?

11:53.914 --> 11:57.137
I mean, he watches people, the neighbors.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.073
He just stands in the window
and stares at them.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.443
Yeah, it's creepy.

12:01.523 --> 12:04.134
Even at night, when you can see him.

12:04.924 --> 12:08.115
Harold Grainey's a freak.
He's probably watching us right now.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.284
- Fuck you.
- I'm serious!

12:10.364 --> 12:13.525
Ten bucks says Grainey is watching us
right now. We can see it right here on the...

12:13.605 --> 12:16.389
- You guys!
- No, come on! Look, take a look.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.334
Take a look.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.018
Get on over there.

12:24.010 --> 12:28.335
Okay, so you see that beige house
right there by Sanjay's?

12:28.415 --> 12:32.447
Okay, look up in the top left window.

12:33.052 --> 12:36.276
Right there, do you see that? The shadow?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.788
- I don't see anything.
- No, babe, behind the curtain?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.994
Look closer... closer.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.576
What the fuck?

12:48.911 --> 12:52.059
- Ethan! Fucking asshole!
- I told you, you'd be surprised.

12:52.139 --> 12:55.529
- Turn that light back on.
- All right, it was not that funny.

12:55.609 --> 12:58.474
It was that funny. Sean?

12:59.879 --> 13:01.458
Nice.

13:05.151 --> 13:09.084
Day six, first incident,
we're gonna call this one light's out.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.290
- Now as you can see, I've...
- Wait. Cat...

13:12.770 --> 13:14.047
Oh, damn it.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.116
Here, take this.
I can change to the ceiling cam.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.398
No, no, no, this shot's better.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.364
Do not enter.

13:23.369 --> 13:27.127
- I told you not to point that thing at me.
- I just told you not to enter, so...

13:27.207 --> 13:30.698
- Why are the lights so low?
- Do you need something?

13:30.778 --> 13:34.268
I'm on my way to work,
there's money on the counter for pizza.

13:34.848 --> 13:38.213
And, Sean, don't let him do anything stupid.
And can you at least try to hide the beer?

13:38.298 --> 13:42.361
Yeah, noted.
Wait, can you shut the door, please?

13:43.256 --> 13:47.104
Okay, start from the top.
Wait for the fucking cat to move.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.447
Come on, baby.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.223
All right, you ready?

14:16.623 --> 14:18.435
Oh, shit.

14:38.437 --> 14:40.456
Grainey, you okay?

14:42.948 --> 14:46.004
- So now what?
- Well, now we wait.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.644
I don't want to drink any more of that beer.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.115
Why, you want a fucking Zima or something?

14:53.605 --> 14:55.118
No, it just tastes like shit.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.484
Okay, I'll be sure to get you
something frilly.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.487
- You can get a Cosmopolitan or something.
- Bottled diarhea or something.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.216
Well, it's a man's beer,
so it makes sense that you don't like it.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.111
Fucking pussy.

15:06.191 --> 15:08.260
Oh, it's so terrible, isn't it?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.664
I just puked a little bit.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.613
- In your pants?
- No, I'm good.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.702
Dude, he's sleeping.

15:15.782 --> 15:18.599
He's not sleeping. Look at him.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.230
Do it!

15:34.700 --> 15:38.162
Is he gonna move or...

15:52.034 --> 15:53.825
Where you going, Grainey?

16:08.502 --> 16:10.013
Yeah.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.551
Shit.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.366
- What's going on?
- Dude, turn the lights back on.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.004
Yeah.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.365
What the hell is this?

16:35.594 --> 16:37.250
- Evening, sir.
- Evening.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.938
I'm responding to your alarm
that went off a short while ago.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.522
What alarm?

16:42.602 --> 16:43.723
You're getting this, right?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.493
Yeah, but we don't have
any audio in the foyer.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.472
Jesus.

16:48.552 --> 16:50.819
No, it hasn't worked for 15 years.

16:51.747 --> 16:55.101
Well, maybe it's just a...
an electrical disturbance.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.824
But we are required to respond.

16:57.904 --> 16:59.726
You mind if I come in?

17:00.572 --> 17:02.619
Yeah, yeah, I do.

17:03.182 --> 17:04.540
Sorry?

17:04.621 --> 17:07.247
I said, "yes, I do."

17:07.327 --> 17:10.573
And the only disturbance
I've had tonight is you.

17:13.632 --> 17:15.335
All right.

17:15.799 --> 17:17.391
I'm glad you're safe.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.925
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.512
Thanks for your concern.

17:28.380 --> 17:31.621
- Holy shit, did you just see that?
- What do you think he said to him?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.922
<i>Please state your full name
and occupation for the jury.</i>

17:49.002 --> 17:53.123
Christopher Todd Palmer,
officer in the Ashland Police Department.

17:53.203 --> 17:55.996
And how did you first come
into contact with the accused?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.898
I was the first officer to respond
to the scene that night.

17:58.978 --> 18:02.269
Officer Palmer, would you please
describe for the court...

18:02.349 --> 18:06.873
...exactly what you saw when you
entered 614 Covered Bridge Road?

18:06.953 --> 18:10.051
After responding to the call,
I canvassed the house.

18:10.156 --> 18:13.788
I entered through the open front door
with my weapon drawn.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.857
I was the only officer there at the time.

18:16.937 --> 18:19.586
And what did you find
when you entered the house?

18:19.666 --> 18:24.191
I heard a noise coming from
the living room. So I approached.

18:24.271 --> 18:29.554
That's when I saw the defendant
standing over a body, covered in blood.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.637
Harold?

18:35.814 --> 18:39.039
Harold! I know you're in there!

18:39.119 --> 18:43.044
Check this out. Hey, dude!

18:43.124 --> 18:45.185
Dude, hey! Wake up!

18:45.758 --> 18:47.602
We got a visitor.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.780
Here he comes.

18:53.860 --> 18:58.472
I need for you to sign these.
I can see your car out here.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.996
Hey, what the hell just happened?

19:03.676 --> 19:06.834
Crap, I don't think our video card driver
likes our surveillance software.

19:06.914 --> 19:09.803
Okay, we have to get this!
All right, you said this would work!

19:09.883 --> 19:12.239
Yeah, I know, I'm not doing this
on purpose, it just...

19:12.319 --> 19:14.597
There, it was just interference.

19:22.060 --> 19:25.490
I wonder if this is
the infamous ex-Mrs. Grainey?

19:26.865 --> 19:28.588
Thought he would have poisoned her, too.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.715
Okay, fine, Harold! You win... again!

19:35.874 --> 19:38.100
What she leave there?

19:38.844 --> 19:40.924
What the hell is wrong with him?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.470
What do you think so far?

20:28.550 --> 20:31.785
It doesn't really matter what I think.
Objectivity, right?

20:31.865 --> 20:36.098
Yeah, but you're the social scientist here.
I mean, what are your observations?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.967
- Honestly?
- Yeah, honestly.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.731
I think scientifically it's interesting
enough just watching someone.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.893
You know, observing someone
in their natural state...

20:48.973 --> 20:52.494
...uninfluenced... there's
something fascinating about it.

20:52.574 --> 20:55.825
Yeah, kind of.

20:55.905 --> 20:57.589
But...

20:57.669 --> 21:01.694
...that's not what we're doing here.
Remember that?

21:09.568 --> 21:13.201
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

21:13.906 --> 21:16.529
Rocky... Rocky!

21:16.609 --> 21:19.841
Get out of here! Get out of here,
you half breed! Shut up!

21:19.921 --> 21:23.069
- Get him out of here!
- Come on, what's the problem here, man?

21:23.149 --> 21:25.005
What's the problem?

21:25.485 --> 21:28.854
Well, the problem is your dog is pissing
and messing up my property.

21:28.934 --> 21:32.775
- Let him piss on your property, okay?
- Come on! Easy, easy!

21:34.494 --> 21:36.516
Maybe I should teach him a lesson.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.457
Keep that son of a bitch on a leash, okay?

21:39.537 --> 21:42.434
'Cause the next time, if it happens again,
I'm gonna cut him in four pieces...

21:42.514 --> 21:44.599
...and send him home in this can.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.495
Let's go, boy.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.420
Let's go, boy.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.295
Come on.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.329
Harold?

23:14.693 --> 23:15.712
Harold?

23:17.197 --> 23:20.820
This screen door won't stay closed.
It keeps popping open.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.057
The kitchen is a mess.
I have to get groceries.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.913
Do you think you can give me a hand?

23:33.912 --> 23:36.269
You know, I really need
your help around here.

23:36.349 --> 23:41.395
I mean, just... just once,
for me, just... just something!

23:46.191 --> 23:48.638
Can you at least fix this door?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.788
See you tonight, Grainey.

24:12.841 --> 24:15.997
Ashley, you've never even been camping.
Why would you...

24:16.697 --> 24:19.927
Why you just bought that for no reason?

24:21.107 --> 24:23.401
- How you doing?
- Quiet, I'm on the phone.

24:23.481 --> 24:27.165
- Why are you drawing dicks on everything?
- It's my "faux de cocks".

24:27.245 --> 24:28.815
What?

24:29.267 --> 24:32.392
- No, no, Sean's just filming me right now.
- It's so immature.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.993
- Reprimanding me.
- On so many levels.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.497
Because I've got cocks on my wall.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.854
Well, no, they weren't...
I drew them on the wall.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.968
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

24:42.048 --> 24:46.105
This is part two of a segment
that I like to call "Knock Knock".

24:46.385 --> 24:48.817
You ready? All right.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.531
Go, ready...

24:51.611 --> 24:54.241
...and wakey-wakey!

25:09.809 --> 25:12.258
There we go, that's a good little boy.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.326
Here he comes.

25:42.008 --> 25:45.287
- He's so confused.
- Why isn't he moving?

25:47.446 --> 25:49.869
I don't know. Let's speed up the door.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.527
Okay.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.331
What the fuck? Where's he going?

25:57.456 --> 25:59.463
Why doesn't he care about the door?

26:01.828 --> 26:03.697
Not in his bedroom.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.388
- He's not outside, I...
- The garage.

26:08.468 --> 26:12.525
Shit. I told you we needed a camera in there.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.785
I mean, this is one
of these vital moments where...

26:14.865 --> 26:16.585
Is that...

26:29.555 --> 26:32.034
Jesus fucking Christ.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.840
He's fucking crazy.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.473
Holy shit.

26:50.978 --> 26:53.056
What the fuck?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.647
Is he... is he looking at us?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.541
- Holy shit, dude!
- Hold on!

27:01.621 --> 27:04.079
- He knows!
- He does not know! Just hold on!

27:04.159 --> 27:05.977
Of course, he knows!
Look at his fucking eyes!

27:06.057 --> 27:09.476
- He's probably coming over here right now!
- Sean, hold on! Relax.

27:09.556 --> 27:11.404
Zoom in.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.014
See? He's just staring at the wall.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.190
Now this guy is fascinating.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.796
- Ethan?
- Wait, where is he going?

27:35.887 --> 27:38.119
- He's going outside.
- Check the other cameras!

27:39.124 --> 27:42.791
- Okay.
- No. No. No.

27:43.396 --> 27:46.653
- Well, where is he?
- Ethan?

27:46.733 --> 27:48.610
You swear he didn't see us?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.068
Maybe he'll leave.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.873
- Okay, take the camera.
- No, I'm not gonna take the camera!

27:56.953 --> 28:00.438
- We need to hide, man!
- Sean! Sean, just take the camera!

28:02.380 --> 28:03.698
Are you fucking kidding me?

28:03.778 --> 28:06.832
What? He's not gonna kill two people on
their own door step. He's not that crazy.

28:06.912 --> 28:10.143
- You're sure?
- Okay, if this is done, then it's done.

28:10.223 --> 28:13.079
So we either call the cops, or go
to the door and see what he wants.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.082
Either way, if you don't record this...

28:16.162 --> 28:18.974
...I'm gonna come back here
and kill you myself.

28:20.098 --> 28:21.357
Shit.

28:58.036 --> 28:59.582
Ethan.

29:06.728 --> 29:08.541
Dude, no!

29:23.795 --> 29:25.307
Ethan!

29:39.277 --> 29:40.856
Ethan?

29:44.482 --> 29:45.995
Ethan!

29:51.723 --> 29:53.603
There you are!

29:56.861 --> 30:00.415
I get one night with you, and I have
to spend it coming across town...

30:00.495 --> 30:04.259
...hunting you down?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

30:25.623 --> 30:27.670
You crazy old man.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.152
Oh, that's nice.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.355
Yeah.

30:35.835 --> 30:38.842
Get you in the limo. Fuck, I...

30:38.922 --> 30:41.793
Jesus, man. You have a problem.
It's 10:00 in the morning.

30:42.175 --> 30:46.398
We are 11 days in.
Some definite incidents to report.

30:46.778 --> 30:50.270
This is the first time that
Mr. Grainey has not left his house...

30:50.350 --> 30:52.255
...at the usual time in four weeks.

30:52.335 --> 30:55.641
Also, a few slight hiccups
in our disturbances.

30:55.721 --> 30:59.679
The first of which was alerting the police
with our electrical interference.

30:59.759 --> 31:03.469
And the second, and more interesting being...

31:03.549 --> 31:07.281
...what can only be described
as a psychotic, violent...

31:07.361 --> 31:09.522
...assault on the old man's own property.

31:10.002 --> 31:15.037
One thing is for sure, it doesn't seem
that he suspects any human interference...

31:15.117 --> 31:17.530
...but his behavior is definitely changing.

31:18.194 --> 31:22.997
As such, the experiment at this point,
can only be described...

31:23.077 --> 31:24.967
...as a success.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.007
I just think we should be careful.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.809
Why don't you tell everybody
why you feel this way?

31:30.889 --> 31:32.211
Why don't you turn the camera off?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.722
I'm just saying, why do you wanna stop this?

31:35.527 --> 31:39.174
Let me guess, you're afraid
that it's actually gonna work.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.756
Hey, Sean, honey,
whose house are you at tonight?

31:43.836 --> 31:47.060
- My mom's.
- And is she cooking you dinner?

31:48.340 --> 31:50.805
No, she's working late again.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.932
Well, then, you're having dinner
with us... again.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.125
Great.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.039
You know who Little Albert is?

32:00.119 --> 32:03.398
Is it some weird way
of introducing me to your dick?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.603
We learned about this in psych, dude.

32:08.060 --> 32:12.699
Back in the 20's, Johns Hopkins University
did this messed up experiment...

32:12.779 --> 32:15.287
...on behavioral conditioning in infants.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.266
The baby they used was called Little Albert.

32:18.871 --> 32:23.269
They would set Little Albert
on a mattress, next to a white lab rat.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.633
At first, he just played with it.
He didn't have any reason to be scared.

32:27.713 --> 32:32.371
But after a while, every time
he touched the rat, it would startle him.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.474
<i>Ringing loud bells or whatever.
And Albert would cry.</i>

32:35.554 --> 32:39.779
<i>Eventually he started to associate
the rat with frightening sensations...</i>

32:39.859 --> 32:43.215
<i>...and whenever he saw anything
that looked even like a rat...</i>

32:43.295 --> 32:46.352
<i>...with or without the sound,
he became terrified.</i>

32:46.432 --> 32:50.445
Okay, help me out, because
I know you have some point here.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.048
My point is...

32:54.359 --> 32:56.633
...be careful how far we push this guy.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.931
We're creating something
that isn't what it seems.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.275
It can do more damage than you think.

33:02.680 --> 33:05.149
All right, boys, it's almost ready.

33:06.852 --> 33:10.336
I'm just saying...
they never cured Little Albert.

33:17.262 --> 33:20.752
All right, so tonight,
we're gonna take things down a notch.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.189
Maybe slamming doors
was a little bit too much, too fast.

33:23.269 --> 33:25.191
So, we've come up with a new haunt.

33:25.271 --> 33:28.471
It's always a classic,
and relatively harmless.

33:28.551 --> 33:33.808
Now as you'll notice, our old man
fell into another whiskey-drenched slumber.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.169
Well, that is a shame that
we're gonna have to wake him up.

33:37.249 --> 33:41.263
This little number I like to call,
"the moonlight sonata".

33:43.688 --> 33:45.978
Wow, and this could not be more perfect.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.840
Sean, if you'll do the honors.

34:00.740 --> 34:03.742
Dude, oh, my God, that's...

34:44.382 --> 34:46.261
What are you doing?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.585
Carrie...

34:49.666 --> 34:52.911
- ...what are you doing?
- I'm dancing, Harold.

34:54.627 --> 34:56.303
Carrie...

34:56.483 --> 34:58.620
...it's 3:00 in the morning.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.596
Is it?

35:03.701 --> 35:05.591
You're drunk, Carrie.

35:05.671 --> 35:09.477
I think on a night like this
I'm allowed to be, don't you think?

35:09.557 --> 35:12.781
No, I don't, I think you should be in bed.

35:13.646 --> 35:16.913
So I can wake up tomorrow
and everything will be better?

35:19.584 --> 35:21.429
So you're being...

35:26.190 --> 35:29.941
No! I want to dance!

35:30.738 --> 35:33.235
What are you... come here. Listen to me.

35:33.315 --> 35:36.355
- No! Oh, my God!
- The neighbors are gonna hear us.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.925
Do you think I care
about the fucking neighbors?

35:40.005 --> 35:41.851
What are you doing?

35:48.681 --> 35:50.492
What are you doing?

36:33.390 --> 36:37.210
- That's interesting.
- At least he didn't hit it with an axe.

36:39.334 --> 36:42.988
All right, it's 11:40 pm.
And Grainey just unlocked the padlock...

36:43.068 --> 36:45.491
...and went down into his basement.
Check it out.

36:45.571 --> 36:49.995
What the hell is a 150-year-old man
doing in a basement at midnight?

36:53.678 --> 36:57.303
It's not the lock that matters, Sean.
It's what's worth locking up.

36:57.383 --> 37:01.907
I mean, Grainey doesn't even lock
his front door, but he locks his basement?

37:01.987 --> 37:06.479
- Isn't that strange to you?
- Yeah, no, that's definitely strange to me.

37:06.559 --> 37:10.162
And there's something mysterious happening...

37:10.242 --> 37:12.885
...but I also think we need
to maintain objectivity...

37:12.965 --> 37:15.871
...which is one of our rules,
and not jump to conclusions, so...

37:15.951 --> 37:18.824
Man, we're gonna be
so fucking famous after this.

37:19.304 --> 37:21.227
- What, man?
- We're gonna be so fucking famous.

37:21.307 --> 37:23.596
I think people are gonna find it
interesting, absolutely.

37:23.676 --> 37:27.133
If you're gonna be famous in your lifetime
it's 'cause you're YouTube famous.

37:27.213 --> 37:30.303
'Cause you made like make-up
tutorial videos or candle reviews.

37:30.383 --> 37:33.472
Dude, you know what?
I respect the candle reviewers.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.815
I mean, come on! What? They got viewership.

37:36.895 --> 37:39.960
I mean, I would give the world
for a million views.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.691
- Yeah, of course, you would.
- This goes out to all the people...

37:42.771 --> 37:45.530
...that gave me one million views.

37:46.048 --> 37:47.868
<i>One million views</i>

37:47.948 --> 37:52.361
<i>I would spend eternity
just to get a million views</i>

37:52.441 --> 37:58.046
<i>I don't give a fuck about you,
all I want is one million views</i>

38:02.580 --> 38:06.245
Captain's log, day 13.

38:06.625 --> 38:10.056
Our fearless leader has succumbed...

38:10.136 --> 38:12.946
...to a six pack of Keystone Light.

38:13.165 --> 38:17.373
But we must forge ahead
and film absolutely everything...

38:17.453 --> 38:19.289
...for posterity.

38:19.497 --> 38:22.288
This is Ethan, asleep...

38:22.368 --> 38:26.658
...across from a video of an open doorway.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.769
Exciting stuff.

38:29.774 --> 38:34.466
Notice the drool forming
on Ethan's pillow, next to his face.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.002
We'll keep that for the director's cut.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.471
This is Ethan's shoe...

38:39.551 --> 38:42.706
...which features a crudely-drawn...

38:42.786 --> 38:46.142
...flock of peni for some reason.

38:46.225 --> 38:48.280
Let's play a game called...

38:48.370 --> 38:51.208
...how many things does Ethan
have open on his computer...

38:51.288 --> 38:53.711
...slowing down our video feed.

38:54.606 --> 38:56.818
Okay, let's do this.

38:57.583 --> 39:00.810
World news, close.

39:01.211 --> 39:03.950
Buzzfeed, close.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.241
Reddit, close.

39:07.321 --> 39:11.560
Facebook, Spotify, Netflix...
close, close, close.

39:13.384 --> 39:17.831
Pornography... of the Asian variety.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.367
Unshaved...

39:21.627 --> 39:24.259
...very discreet, Ethan, close.

39:24.808 --> 39:27.813
An IMDB search for "Mac and me".

39:28.093 --> 39:30.947
Close, and...

39:58.696 --> 40:02.690
Dude. Dude, dude, dude.

40:02.770 --> 40:04.842
Dude, wake up.

40:04.922 --> 40:07.101
- What?
- Get up!

40:07.206 --> 40:10.018
I gotta show you something.
Here, take the camera.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.035
Fuck... what?

40:17.115 --> 40:22.495
Okay, so, this is Grainey going
down to the basement at 11:38 pm.

40:22.575 --> 40:26.123
- Okay.
- This is Grainey now. Live feed.

40:26.203 --> 40:27.308
Okay, yeah.

40:27.388 --> 40:30.416
And this is Grainey
coming out of the basement.

40:32.496 --> 40:36.297
- Okay, I...
- Note the time difference.

40:36.402 --> 40:40.517
6:55 a.m. So he was down there all night?

40:40.597 --> 40:43.340
Seven hours. I mean, what the hell
would he be doing in the basement...

40:43.420 --> 40:45.835
...in the middle of the night,
for seven hours?

40:47.472 --> 40:51.995
Do I detect some actual enthusiasm in
your voice? And not whiny hesitation?

40:52.075 --> 40:54.096
Any opportunity to be an idiot.

40:57.085 --> 41:00.639
Okay, it's day 15, 2:10 in the morning.

41:00.719 --> 41:04.249
Got a very interesting one for you tonight.
This one is called "cold spots".

41:04.329 --> 41:08.170
Now the original idea behind this
was to kill the thermostat...

41:08.250 --> 41:10.656
...to mimic the drop in temperature
brought on by spirits.

41:10.736 --> 41:14.874
But Sean here had the ingenious
idea for the windows.

41:14.954 --> 41:17.381
So, Sean, if you will.

41:17.461 --> 41:21.604
Okay, so, there's a chemical solvent that
you can make from an alkaline battery...

41:21.684 --> 41:25.937
...which, among other things
causes glass to crack in the cold.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.329
It's essentially an anti-anti-freeze.

41:28.409 --> 41:32.633
And Sean spread it all over the windows,
the night we broke into Grainey's.

41:32.713 --> 41:36.984
Now we've already killed the heater,
and it's about 36 degrees outside...

41:37.064 --> 41:39.612
...so as you can imagine...

41:39.692 --> 41:42.510
...that bedroom's gonna get
pretty fucking cold.

41:46.838 --> 41:50.321
It's kind of beautiful watching
an old man sleep thinking, you know...

41:50.401 --> 41:53.756
- ...what he's dreaming about.
- World War I.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.703
- You falling asleep?
- No.

41:57.783 --> 41:59.661
Better not be.

42:03.821 --> 42:06.468
Quitter. Quitter!

42:40.739 --> 42:45.251
Yo, dude. Hey, Sean, come here.
I want you to see Grainey's face.

42:45.331 --> 42:47.342
- What?
- Come here.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.568
Look, look at Grainey's face,
right there, what do you see?

42:57.378 --> 43:00.805
- I don't see anything.
- No, here. Right there.

43:02.848 --> 43:05.537
He's shivering. Come on, man,
this is kind of fucked up.

43:05.617 --> 43:08.507
He's... he's not shivering.
He's saying something.

43:08.887 --> 43:12.036
- The audio, can you...
- Yeah. Got it.

43:12.116 --> 43:14.038
What are you...

43:22.399 --> 43:25.190
- Fuck! Shit!
- You, in the hallway now!

43:25.270 --> 43:27.859
- You turn the camera off!
- Fuck...

43:27.939 --> 43:31.930
Are you out of your mind, Ethan?
Have you listened to what I said?

43:32.010 --> 43:35.033
Right, I'm sorry, I just... I...
Sean wanted to see it.

43:35.113 --> 43:40.117
How could such an elaborate scheme
be executed right under your own roof...

43:40.197 --> 43:43.267
...for upwards of six weeks...

43:43.347 --> 43:46.254
...without the least of your
objection or interference?

43:46.334 --> 43:49.755
Honestly, I never knew what they were doing.

43:49.835 --> 43:52.061
You never knew what they were doing?

43:52.630 --> 43:57.959
Your son and his friend spent
an average of 50 hours a week...

43:58.039 --> 44:00.461
...in your son's bedroom...

44:00.541 --> 44:04.657
...with a professional grade equipment
hub that you didn't purchase...

44:04.737 --> 44:08.634
...and you never once inquired
as to what they were up to?

44:08.714 --> 44:10.811
No, of course, I asked.

44:11.516 --> 44:16.498
Sean said his father bought the computers
for him. His father had money.

44:16.578 --> 44:20.459
Had Ethan and Sean
ever gotten into trouble before?

44:20.539 --> 44:23.826
Sean? Never. But Ethan...

44:26.231 --> 44:29.464
...he got into some trouble
after his father left.

44:30.235 --> 44:32.813
But meeting Sean this year...

44:32.893 --> 44:36.176
...it's just been such
a good influence on him.

44:37.275 --> 44:39.688
And trust me, when you're a mother...

44:40.800 --> 44:44.035
...you would so much rather have your son...

44:44.115 --> 44:48.203
...sitting with his friends
in his room with cameras than...

44:48.283 --> 44:52.260
...out God-knows-where doing drugs
and drinking, and getting into trouble.

44:52.340 --> 44:56.298
But would you agree that they still
found a way to get into trouble?

44:56.378 --> 44:59.189
Objection, your honor. Argumentative.

44:59.269 --> 45:04.479
I'll rephrase. At no point during
your son's six-week experiment...

45:04.559 --> 45:06.680
...did you ever become concerned...

45:06.760 --> 45:10.020
...that any of their actions
could get them into trouble?

45:11.109 --> 45:13.719
When I came home that night...

45:13.799 --> 45:18.006
...I noticed that Ethan
had gone through my closet.

45:18.086 --> 45:20.128
And why did this concern you?

45:23.287 --> 45:27.488
Because that's where I kept his father's gun.

45:56.019 --> 45:57.866
It's working.

47:12.296 --> 47:15.617
- Hey.
- I wasn't sure if you'd make it.

47:15.967 --> 47:18.656
- She'll be home soon.
- Yeah.

47:18.736 --> 47:20.549
We have time.

47:23.607 --> 47:25.486
It's freezing in here.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.366
Dude, he's just sitting there.

48:14.946 --> 48:16.804
What the fuck?

48:43.634 --> 48:47.145
Okay, so, not only did "cold spots" work...

48:47.225 --> 48:50.782
...but it yielded a much more
interesting development.

48:50.862 --> 48:56.120
Now we're both convinced that our haunts
and Grainey's basement are somehow related.

48:56.200 --> 49:00.396
And he's been down there
for a couple hours, so...

49:00.476 --> 49:02.488
What do you think is down there?

49:03.074 --> 49:04.919
What about his wife?

49:05.937 --> 49:08.039
It can't be, we already saw her.

49:08.119 --> 49:10.469
- Did we?
- Yeah, we did.

49:10.549 --> 49:13.594
Well, how do we know that was his wife?
Maybe it was just some old woman.

49:13.674 --> 49:15.573
Yeah, but, nobody visits Grainey.

49:15.653 --> 49:18.477
Why would some old lady
just be pounding on his door?

49:18.557 --> 49:21.785
Who the hell knows?
I'm just saying, add it to the board.

49:28.849 --> 49:31.315
You know what the weirdest thing
about this is?

49:32.704 --> 49:36.261
No matter what we do to this guy,
he never calls the cops.

49:36.341 --> 49:38.931
Or does anything about it for that matter.

49:39.011 --> 49:42.076
Would you call the cops if you had
a body in your basement?

49:44.154 --> 49:46.959
Don't you think it's weird? I mean...

49:47.039 --> 49:51.916
...after everything that's happened to
this guy, he's never once seemed afraid.

49:53.158 --> 49:55.413
- Oh, here he comes.
- Mark it, dude. What time is it?

49:55.493 --> 49:59.358
- 8:28 a.m.
- Okay, so that's...

50:00.479 --> 50:02.916
An hour and ten minutes in the basement.

50:04.568 --> 50:08.029
All right, Sean, you know
what needs to happen now, right?

50:08.612 --> 50:09.960
- No way, dude.
- Yes.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.404
- No!
- Sean...

50:11.484 --> 50:13.592
- We're not going in there.
- We have talked about this.

50:13.672 --> 50:16.682
Yeah, and I said the same thing then.
There's no way.

50:16.762 --> 50:19.276
All we have to do
is find a way past the lock.

50:19.356 --> 50:24.001
No, actually, because even if we
break the lock, which he'll notice...

50:24.081 --> 50:27.493
...we still have to get in there when he's not
home. And Grainey never leaves the house.

50:27.573 --> 50:29.698
Who's to say when he's
gonna be leaving again?

50:29.778 --> 50:32.033
All I'm saying is we have a film to finish.

50:32.113 --> 50:36.027
And you and I both know that there's
something going on in that basement, okay?

50:36.107 --> 50:39.115
And I have reason to believe that we're
not the ones committing the crime anymore.

50:39.195 --> 50:43.448
Sean, come on! We're this close,
all right? Don't let me down on this.

50:44.809 --> 50:48.222
Seriously, how can you live
with yourself without knowing?

50:58.588 --> 51:02.622
- Well, we're not going when he's there.
- Okay, yeah, deal.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.649
And we still need
to find a way past the lock.

51:04.729 --> 51:08.293
- Yeah, so we'll find a way.
- All right, well, any ideas?

51:08.373 --> 51:10.740
I don't know, man, you're the one
going to MIT, all right?

51:10.820 --> 51:13.311
It's a problem. Just find a solution.

51:23.754 --> 51:27.439
Okay, so, here's the thing.

51:27.519 --> 51:30.011
Maybe we don't need to go into the basement.

51:30.291 --> 51:31.851
What?

51:32.956 --> 51:35.603
Not if we can get someone else
to go in there for us.

51:40.350 --> 51:43.579
- Why am I filming this?
- What? Because.

51:43.659 --> 51:45.515
- Are we on?
- Yeah.

51:45.595 --> 51:47.458
Grainey still out?

51:47.538 --> 51:49.795
Grainey hasn't moved all morning.

51:50.275 --> 51:53.561
All right, then. Let's go. Come on.

51:55.579 --> 51:57.606
All right, I want you
to go back in my room...

51:57.686 --> 52:00.438
...call my phone if Grainey
even moves, then you tell me, okay?

52:00.518 --> 52:04.175
I'm gonna plant this bug and you
let me know when you hear it, okay?

52:04.255 --> 52:06.466
I'll be back before you know it.

52:10.394 --> 52:12.097
Okay, I can see you.

52:12.177 --> 52:13.915
And...

52:13.995 --> 52:17.726
...Grainey still hasn't moved,
so you're all good. Hurry up!

52:17.806 --> 52:19.360
Come on.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.903
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

52:20.983 --> 52:24.930
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're all good,
but you should come back now.

52:25.010 --> 52:28.880
<i>Just two seconds.
I gotta get it hooked on this thing.</i>

52:31.681 --> 52:33.471
Oh, shit!

52:33.551 --> 52:36.698
Come on! Right now, really? Fuck.

52:44.293 --> 52:46.051
- Ethan?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

52:46.131 --> 52:48.791
Yeah, I can't see Grainey, so...

52:48.871 --> 52:51.378
- ...you need to come back now.
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

52:56.632 --> 52:58.886
He was just taking a leak.

53:02.079 --> 53:04.529
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

53:33.309 --> 53:35.589
Run, run, run, run!

53:49.072 --> 53:52.702
All right, Sean. Ready to give
Mr. Grainey a wake-up call?

54:01.004 --> 54:03.417
Hi, yes, Ashland Police Department.

54:16.686 --> 54:20.168
- I hope this works.
- Don't hope it works, Sean, expect it to.

54:46.082 --> 54:48.675
Mr. Grainey. I hope you're well this evening.

54:48.755 --> 54:50.241
<i>I was sleeping.</i>

54:50.321 --> 54:52.840
- Is the sound okay?
- Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.409
<i>I was trying to sleep.</i>

54:54.489 --> 54:58.117
I'm sorry for the late hour.
I just wanted to make sure...

54:58.197 --> 55:01.986
...that you didn't hear anything out of the
ordinary tonight while you were sleeping.

55:02.066 --> 55:04.702
- Anything at all?
- No, I didn't hear a thing...

55:04.782 --> 55:06.924
...so, if you don't mind...

55:07.004 --> 55:09.669
The reason I'm here is because
we got a noise complaint.

55:09.774 --> 55:11.829
About a woman screaming.

55:12.509 --> 55:15.575
- Well, I...
- In your basement, sir.

55:16.558 --> 55:19.434
- In my basement?
- Look, we got a call.

55:19.784 --> 55:23.007
Apparently one of your neighbors
was walking his dog...

55:23.087 --> 55:26.344
...said he heard a woman
screaming in your basement.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.656
That's absurd.

55:29.861 --> 55:32.850
Well, then you wouldn't mind
if I come in to take a look, right?

55:32.930 --> 55:34.762
Just to be thorough?

55:36.137 --> 55:37.711
<i>Sure.</i>

55:49.045 --> 55:50.858
<i>Be careful.</i>

55:52.644 --> 55:54.916
Let's see what you got down there, Grainey.

55:56.621 --> 55:58.433
Moment of truth.

56:03.326 --> 56:05.406
It's just storage down here.

57:05.689 --> 57:07.562
All right.

57:08.567 --> 57:10.370
I think we're good here.

57:22.238 --> 57:24.234
You sure they said it was a woman?

57:24.314 --> 57:27.546
That's right. Why?

57:30.263 --> 57:32.910
Nah... never mind.

57:35.255 --> 57:38.119
- <i>Sorry to disturb you again, sir.
- Yeah.</i>

57:40.857 --> 57:42.703
You gotta be kidding me.

57:45.629 --> 57:49.477
- He didn't find anything?
- He wasn't looking hard enough.

57:57.674 --> 58:01.555
No! No way! We're not going in there!

58:04.197 --> 58:06.076
We're not!

58:08.885 --> 58:11.042
- Say it again, Sean.
- Fuck you.

58:11.122 --> 58:13.420
No, come on, say it to the camera.

58:14.125 --> 58:18.362
Sean, obviously it's bothering you,
so let's talk about it, okay? On the record.

58:18.930 --> 58:21.018
You know what I think.

58:21.098 --> 58:23.521
What, you think I'm ruining my own project?

58:23.901 --> 58:26.166
I'm sorry, our project.

58:26.971 --> 58:31.037
I think you know you're ruining it,
but it's easier for you to blame me.

58:31.742 --> 58:35.699
We wait till he leaves,
we knock that goddamn door down...

58:35.779 --> 58:39.203
...and we see what's in the basement.
Documentary over, it's that simple.

58:39.283 --> 58:42.754
Unless nothing's in there.
Then documentary ruined...

58:42.834 --> 58:46.311
...burglary charges, and a waste
of all of our time and money.

58:46.391 --> 58:48.579
We have one more weekend, okay?
One more haunt.

58:48.659 --> 58:51.315
We move the furniture around,
just like in Poltergeist.

58:51.395 --> 58:54.719
- Just like we planned.
- No, no, it needs more.

58:54.799 --> 58:58.094
Come on, doesn't a part of you
need to know what's down there?

58:59.269 --> 59:02.660
Sean, let do something different.
Let's do something dangerous.

59:02.740 --> 59:06.205
Let's do something your daddy's
not gonna approve of.

59:06.710 --> 59:07.999
What?

59:08.079 --> 59:10.711
No, it's just funny that you
should put it that way.

59:11.816 --> 59:13.393
What?

59:17.954 --> 59:20.778
Do you want to get into
what this is really about, Ethan?

59:21.758 --> 59:23.648
What do you mean?

59:24.328 --> 59:27.552
- I think you know what I mean.
- No, Sean, please, enlighten me.

59:28.572 --> 59:32.230
I know about Grainey... and your father.

59:35.805 --> 59:37.695
What did you say?

59:38.175 --> 59:39.987
You heard me.

59:41.961 --> 59:44.235
Now do you want to turn the camera off?

59:46.382 --> 59:49.801
<i>That was the afternoon of October 22nd, 2014.</i>

59:49.881 --> 59:52.053
<i>3:40 p.m.</i>

59:53.938 --> 59:58.232
What did the two of you discuss
after the camera was turned off?

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.779
Should I repeat the question, Sean?

01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:08.010
He told me the story of what
really happened with his father.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.860
A story you never heard before?

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:13.228
Yeah, this all happened before
I moved to the neighborhood.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:19.030
But Ethan would always tell me
that his father left him.

01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:24.482
And what prompted him
to finally tell you the truth?

01:00:24.562 --> 01:00:29.166
I found an email open
on his computer from his father.

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:34.653
He always said that he never talked
to him, so I thought that was strange.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.365
I shouldn't have read it, but...

01:00:38.445 --> 01:00:40.463
What did Ethan tell you?

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:42.407
Well...

01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:46.496
...his mom and dad were having problems.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:50.280
One night, things got physical,
it was pretty bad.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.438
His mom ran out and went for help.

01:00:53.868 --> 01:00:56.480
And who's house did she run to?

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.687
Mr. Grainey's.

01:01:01.192 --> 01:01:02.938
Harold Grainey...

01:01:03.018 --> 01:01:07.349
...interfered in a domestic dispute
with Ethan's parents...

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:11.055
...causing an altercation of his own
with Ethan's father.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.332
And when the police arrived,
Mr. Grainey's testimony...

01:01:14.412 --> 01:01:17.963
...sent Ethan's father
to jail that night, correct?

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.595
That's right.

01:01:20.675 --> 01:01:25.132
Well, it doesn't sound like Mr. Grainey did
anything wrong in that scenario, does it?

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:29.274
No. It doesn't.

01:01:29.654 --> 01:01:32.877
And what ended up happening
with Ethan's father?

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:37.415
Well, the way that Ethan told it...

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.185
...Grainey had a long talk
with his mom that night.

01:01:41.265 --> 01:01:45.725
By the time his dad got out,
she wanted him gone and filed for divorce.

01:01:45.805 --> 01:01:49.112
- And full custody of Ethan.
- Yes.

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:53.768
So despite Ethan's father's obvious
responsibility in this particular incident...

01:01:53.848 --> 01:01:57.403
...to a 13-year-old boy
reading these emails...

01:01:57.483 --> 01:02:00.275
...it would seem that an old man
interfered in his life...

01:02:00.355 --> 01:02:02.842
...and that his father was taken away.

01:02:03.437 --> 01:02:06.177
It's quite a good reason to hold
a grudge, wouldn't you say?

01:02:06.257 --> 01:02:08.813
Objection. Speculation.

01:02:08.893 --> 01:02:12.370
Is it not a fact that Mr. Grainey
had a conversation...

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:14.942
...with Ethan's mother
the night of the altercation?

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:17.922
And that Ethan never saw his father again?

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:20.869
Yeah, no, but...

01:02:22.637 --> 01:02:24.189
...see...

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.464
...no one was ever supposed to get hurt.

01:02:26.544 --> 01:02:29.975
So Ethan never implied that the man
he referred to as, quote...

01:02:30.355 --> 01:02:34.343
"...a miserable, wife-beating, drunk
piece of shit," should be punished...

01:02:34.423 --> 01:02:37.450
...even to the point
where he might react violently?

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:39.759
No...

01:02:40.984 --> 01:02:42.833
...it was just a prank...

01:02:43.617 --> 01:02:45.444
...an experiment.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:27.094
Here's to my mom working nights,
because if she didn't...

01:03:27.174 --> 01:03:30.275
...we couldn't actively make bad
decisions at my house. Give it up.

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:33.253
One, two, three!

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:39.024
Hey, Carly, how's that Tequila treating you?

01:03:39.404 --> 01:03:42.173
- Really good.
- Hey, give me the camera.

01:03:42.253 --> 01:03:44.308
- No, man, why?
- Everyone's gonna see this.

01:03:44.388 --> 01:03:47.057
- Ted Spiegelman, ladies and gentleman.
- Gobble, gobble.

01:03:47.137 --> 01:03:49.513
The guy that dressed up like one creepy cock.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:52.016
- Biggest cock.
- That you are.

01:03:52.096 --> 01:03:56.391
And you're the only person to
actually dress up, well, besides...

01:03:56.471 --> 01:04:00.958
...Ashley who dressed up like a slutty witch?

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:04.278
Yo, hey, man, I was doing good,
come on, give it back.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:07.264
Okay, so he disappears for,
like, two minutes.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:11.736
And then he comes charging out of
the garage with this giant fucking axe.

01:04:11.816 --> 01:04:14.243
- Shut up.
- No, no, seriously. So wait, wait, wait.

01:04:14.323 --> 01:04:18.264
He takes the axe and he
walks over to the door...

01:04:18.344 --> 01:04:21.131
...and then he just destroys it! Just like...

01:04:21.211 --> 01:04:23.422
...like Shelley Duvall was on the other side.

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.085
Who?

01:04:25.935 --> 01:04:27.833
Never mind.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:33.290
Okay, why don't you put
that thing down now, Ethan?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.068
You know I'm seriously considering it.

01:04:36.856 --> 01:04:40.862
Just two seconds, I gotta go find Sean.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.846
Wow, guys. I don't know
if that's more stupid...

01:04:49.926 --> 01:04:51.719
- ...or racist.
- What?

01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:54.525
Sanjay's from Malaysia.
They don't wear fucking turbans.

01:04:54.605 --> 01:04:56.466
Whatever, man.

01:04:56.864 --> 01:04:58.441
Asshole.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:06.264
Hi, Carly. Are you having fun?

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:08.255
Ethan...

01:05:09.636 --> 01:05:11.561
...I have to apologize.

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.432
I gave you shit about your project,
but it actually seems pretty awesome.

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.268
Well, thank you. It is pretty awesome.

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.337
Do you actually think that he's a murderer?

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:24.254
Well, Carly. You'll just have
to wait and see. Right, Sean?

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:31.040
So, is there a place where Sean and I
can go to get away from all the cameras?

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:35.752
The cameras are bothering you?
Okay, well, you could go to my room.

01:05:37.432 --> 01:05:40.825
Okay, no, bad idea.
Why don't you go to Sean's room?

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:42.446
You have your own room here?

01:05:42.526 --> 01:05:45.575
Well, technically it's a guest room,
but since Sean practically lives...

01:05:45.655 --> 01:05:47.539
Sounds great.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.357
Well, you guys enjoy your privacy.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:12.475
I just get really frustrated
having Ethan film everything that I do.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:15.637
It's really hard to get you alone, you know.

01:06:15.717 --> 01:06:17.946
It's like you're always with Ethan.

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:23.308
- Yeah, maybe too much, right?
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.284
I just feel like...

01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:29.540
...what we're doing is getting a little...

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.672
...I don't know... dangerous.

01:06:35.024 --> 01:06:36.559
Well...

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:42.731
...can't a little danger be a good thing?

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:48.254
What is that?

01:06:48.334 --> 01:06:50.551
- What?
- That.

01:06:50.631 --> 01:06:52.829
Oh, my God! Shit, Ethan!

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.421
Shit.

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:03.140
What the fuck, Ethan?
Enjoy your privacy? Are you kidding me?

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.042
- Just relax.
- Give me that! Turn it off!

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:08.745
- Stop! Relax!
- Relax? Relax? This is sick!

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:11.716
Wait, wait, how long has it been in there?
Do you... you watch me sleep now?

01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:15.694
Sean, it was just for tonight. I swear.

01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.730
I wanted to see if you'd say something
about the project. I knew you'd be...

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.734
The project?
Forget the fucking project, okay?

01:07:21.814 --> 01:07:26.005
- Do you understand what this means?
- I'm sorry about the camera, but...

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:28.135
...Sean, you don't get it,
we're so close here.

01:07:28.215 --> 01:07:31.635
You're obsessed. Okay, I told you,
we're not going in the basement.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:35.405
We were here to haunt the dude.
Does he not seem haunted to you?

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:37.734
Not enough, no.

01:07:38.014 --> 01:07:40.079
Well, it's enough for me, okay?

01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:42.479
You got your revenge,
but I didn't sign up for this.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.404
Sean, stop!

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.085
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:53.223
You were nobody until
I picked you up, don't forget that.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:56.727
I had this idea and you had the brains
and money to make it happen.

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:58.945
And look at what we've accomplished.

01:07:59.025 --> 01:08:03.242
So it's exactly what you signed up for,
so don't act like it's not.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:07.062
I mean, would you be anywhere
if it hadn't been for me?

01:08:07.142 --> 01:08:08.772
Would you have gone to any parties?

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:12.350
Would you have been with Carly
tonight if it wasn't for me?

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:15.011
Would you have left your boring,
nerdy, rich circle...

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.724
...and had any fun before graduation
if it hadn't been for me?

01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:24.154
- Fuck you, Ethan.
- Fuck me. They're your cameras.

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:28.335
Sean, your fingerprints,
traceable to your credit card.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.434
Is that a threat?

01:08:33.999 --> 01:08:35.805
It's the truth.

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:39.336
All I've ever wanted
from this project is the truth.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.538
So the world could see exactly what it is...

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:45.009
The world is only gonna see what
you want them to see, Ethan. Okay?

01:08:45.089 --> 01:08:48.466
Don't you get it? It's not even about
Grainey anymore, it's about you, and...

01:08:48.546 --> 01:08:51.015
- Okay!
- I don't even know...

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:53.368
...why I agreed to do this. I just feel...

01:08:53.448 --> 01:08:56.792
Dude, you know what?
Feel however you want, Sean.

01:08:56.872 --> 01:08:58.725
That's fine.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:04.567
I'm sorry about the camera,
that was a shitty thing to do.

01:09:06.602 --> 01:09:09.041
But you listen to me very carefully.

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.258
Whatever happens here...

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:15.944
...you and me are in this together.

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:19.332
Got it?

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.145
Get the fuck out.

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:22.545
Come in.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:10:33.987 --> 01:10:37.023
Hey, so, I'm...

01:10:37.103 --> 01:10:39.304
...I'm sorry about the other night.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:44.454
If it makes you feel any better,
Carly said she really liked you.

01:10:44.534 --> 01:10:48.222
- So... what's up?
- I want my equipment back.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.544
What?

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:56.556
The computers, the monitors, the cameras.
I'll let you edit what you have so far...

01:10:56.636 --> 01:10:59.055
- ...but I'm done.
- Are you're serious?

01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:02.846
I just said sorry to you.
I mean, what more do you want?

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.035
That's not what this is about.

01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:09.773
Okay, you know what,
you're not thinking straight.

01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:12.456
Why don't we just take a break,
we'll take a breather...

01:11:12.536 --> 01:11:15.091
...let's have some beers,
let's hang out, let's...

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.834
Fuck!

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.764
Holy shit.

01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:23.367
- No way that actually happened.
- That goddamn cat!

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:26.531
- I honestly can't believe that happened.
- Fuck! All right...

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.641
- It's over.
- What are you talking about?

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:34.811
What do you mean?
The camera is on the ground.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.646
So the whole thing is over.

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:41.318
The camera's on the ground in the den.
Grainey is asleep, in his bedroom.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.320
- It's not that complicated.
- Seriously, Ethan...

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:47.433
Sean, your cameras,
your fingerprints, remember?

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.526
Think about MIT.

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:54.163
We know every inch of that house.
I will be in and out in 30 seconds.

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:57.287
- It's not like we've never broken in before.
- Not while he was home, we haven't.

01:11:57.367 --> 01:11:59.689
- Are you stupid, Ethan?
- He's asleep.

01:11:59.769 --> 01:12:03.086
And what happens when he wakes up?
Do you remember what he did to the door?

01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:04.978
- That was a door.
- Will you just hand me my phone?

01:12:05.058 --> 01:12:07.826
- Goddamnit, Ethan! Are you actually crazy?
- Hand me my phone!

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.312
No.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:12.941
If you were ever my friend,
you would back me up right now.

01:12:13.066 --> 01:12:16.876
Now I will be gone for two minutes.
Text me if Grainey wakes up.

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:04.224
Oh, God.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.875
Okay, go.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.758
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:49.946
No.

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:54.066
No, no, no, no... shit.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.018
No, don't do it. Don't go down there.

01:14:51.486 --> 01:14:53.333
What is all this?

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.365
Shit.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.992
Okay.

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.444
Shit.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:46.403
Oh, shit.

01:15:46.483 --> 01:15:49.499
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:51.124
Shit.

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.003
Shit, go.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.267
Come on, Ethan, get out of there, come on.

01:16:23.213 --> 01:16:25.425
Hide, Ethan, hide!

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.350
Oh, no.

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.701
Holy shit.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:38.131
Where are you going?

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.677
Okay. Shit.

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:46.611
Don't move yet, Ethan, I can't see.

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:55.148
What the hell?

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:58.715
Oh, God.

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:10.980
Fuck.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:56.389
Oh, my God!

01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:12.410
Oh, my God! We just...

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.263
He just...

01:19:33.318 --> 01:19:34.883
Ethan?

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:40.729
- Ethan!
- He... he's dead?

01:19:40.809 --> 01:19:43.666
Yeah, he is dead. He just shot
himself in the fucking head.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.402
What have we done?

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.705
Why? I just... I don't get it.

01:19:48.985 --> 01:19:51.408
It's because of the bell, Ethan.
It's because of the goddamn bell.

01:19:51.488 --> 01:19:55.345
No, we wanted to move something.
That was part of the plan.

01:19:55.425 --> 01:19:58.481
The plan? We killed him!

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:02.886
We didn't kill him.
We... we didn't do anything.

01:20:02.966 --> 01:20:05.753
Yeah, we did do something, okay?
Which means it's our fault...

01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:08.154
...which means we're gonna go
to fucking jail for a long-ass time!

01:20:08.234 --> 01:20:12.119
Shut up! Shut up for a second,
okay? Just let me...

01:20:13.025 --> 01:20:15.676
...let me think for a goddamn second, okay?

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:22.914
- Oh, shit, Ethan, your foot.
- Fuck.

01:20:23.419 --> 01:20:26.076
Our fingerprints are everywhere, okay?
They're on all the cameras.

01:20:26.156 --> 01:20:28.178
Your fingerprints are on the bell.
All over the house!

01:20:28.258 --> 01:20:32.670
The old man killed himself, okay?
We were never here.

01:20:34.296 --> 01:20:36.317
Okay, so... so...

01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:38.420
...you get the cameras...

01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:43.926
...and I'll clean this up.
We're gonna be fine, yeah.

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:46.129
Okay... hey!

01:20:46.209 --> 01:20:49.207
Sean, look at me! Hey! Hey! Look at me!

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:51.939
We're gonna be fine, okay?

01:20:52.019 --> 01:20:55.622
Let's go. Go. Come on.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.888
Okay, I got the...

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:26.458
Oh, God.

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:30.014
Oh, God.

01:21:30.309 --> 01:21:32.354
Sean, help me.

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:34.230
Sean!

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:35.888
Freeze!

01:21:36.743 --> 01:21:39.444
You, on the ground now.

01:21:39.524 --> 01:21:42.556
You, face on the floor, hands on your head.

01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:25.528
Sit up for me, please. Come here.

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:27.481
I'm sorry, honey.

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.869
I'm sorry.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.779
Come on. Come here.

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.715
Come on.

01:22:37.795 --> 01:22:40.210
- What do I...
- Come here.

01:22:41.023 --> 01:22:43.346
Okay, now...

01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:45.298
...let's dance.

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:21.673
Thank you.

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:27.183
Oh, it feels so good to be home.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:36.432
You wanna go see?
Do you want to go see Caroline?

01:23:36.512 --> 01:23:40.070
Let's go see Caroline. Come here.

01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:41.871
Who's this?

01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:43.963
Oh, my goodness.

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.964
He's a sweet baby.

01:23:52.358 --> 01:23:54.182
Sweet baby.

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:18.441
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:22.511
I just came from your garden, was out
there, everything's holding up great.

01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:26.862
- How about you, how you holding up?
- I'm doing great. What do you think?

01:24:30.105 --> 01:24:33.348
I... I bought you something.

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:38.006
- What's in there?
- The idea is you open it.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:40.064
All right.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:44.233
Let's see, what is it?
What is it? What is it?

01:24:46.513 --> 01:24:50.642
- The one I've always wanted.
- Now don't be a smart ass.

01:24:50.722 --> 01:24:52.809
I mean, this is a real antique.

01:24:53.889 --> 01:24:57.032
Look, we don't need you
yelling and screaming...

01:24:57.112 --> 01:24:59.238
...wasting energy for no reason.

01:24:59.318 --> 01:25:02.141
Sometimes Amy and I aren't here to hear you.

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.957
You know, I just want you to know that...

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:17.936
...whenever you need anything...

01:25:18.016 --> 01:25:20.111
...I mean anything at all...

01:25:21.532 --> 01:25:24.130
All you have to do is ring this and...

01:25:25.059 --> 01:25:26.873
...I'll hear it, honey.

01:25:28.489 --> 01:25:31.950
And I'll come to you, no matter what, okay?

01:25:42.938 --> 01:25:44.516
Good.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.518
It works.

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:10.591
What do you mean when you say
that this was almost inevitable?

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.643
Harold lost himself when Caroline died.

01:27:15.031 --> 01:27:17.586
He lost everything that made him happy.

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.323
And twelve years is a long time to be alone.

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:24.303
Are you implying that Harold
had suicidal tendencies?

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:29.711
What I'm saying is that Harold was hurting.

01:27:29.791 --> 01:27:32.656
And he was hurting himself.

01:27:33.036 --> 01:27:37.938
But I made a promise to Caroline that
I would make sure he was gonna be all right.

01:27:38.018 --> 01:27:40.673
But he wasn't all right, was he?

01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.845
No, he wasn't.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:47.149
And that's why you went to his home
one final time on September 24th?

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:48.801
Correct.

01:27:49.581 --> 01:27:51.303
What did you bring him that day?

01:27:51.383 --> 01:27:54.430
I found a place for him to go.

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:57.994
Somewhere where he could get
proper professional care.

01:27:58.374 --> 01:28:00.482
Where he wouldn't be alone.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.954
It took me months to try
to get him to sign the papers.

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.532
It got to a point where he...

01:28:08.612 --> 01:28:11.013
...he didn't want to talk to me anymore.

01:28:11.737 --> 01:28:15.632
Did he ever mention to you why
he didn't want to receive proper care?

01:28:16.592 --> 01:28:18.642
He never wanted to leave that house.

01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:22.384
He said Caroline was there.

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:28.615
Will the defendants please rise?

01:28:33.174 --> 01:28:36.114
Before I issue your sentencing...

01:28:36.196 --> 01:28:38.930
...I want to remind the court...

01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:40.717
...that in this state...

01:28:40.797 --> 01:28:43.681
...we abide by the felony murder rule...

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:49.698
...which states if a death occurs
during the commission of a felony...

01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:54.050
<i>...any felony, the persons
responsible for that felony...</i>

01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:58.888
<i>...can be charged with murder,
regardless of intent.</i>

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:02.300
<i>Mr. Fleming, Mr. Turner...</i>

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:06.414
<i>...your actions,
regardless of your intentions...</i>

01:29:06.494 --> 01:29:08.973
<i>...led to a man's death.</i>

01:29:09.978 --> 01:29:11.762
<i>It wasn't enough...</i>

01:29:11.842 --> 01:29:15.330
<i>...that you tormented a lonely old man...</i>

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:18.492
<i>...but then you were perverse enough...</i>

01:29:18.572 --> 01:29:20.375
<i>...to record it.</i>

01:29:21.056 --> 01:29:23.860
<i>Justice, in my opinion...</i>

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:29.700
...would be the guilt of this tragedy
punishing you for the rest of your lives.

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:35.591
The law, however,
can only punish you for so long.

01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:39.886
You've been found guilty
of illegal surveillance...

01:29:39.966 --> 01:29:43.789
...and breaking and entering,
both misdemeanors.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:47.134
Since you are both minors...

01:29:47.214 --> 01:29:49.908
...with no prior records...

01:29:50.931 --> 01:29:54.978
...I hereby sentence you
to two years probation.

01:29:55.058 --> 01:29:58.501
500 hours community service.

01:29:59.448 --> 01:30:01.289
That's it.

01:31:58.331 --> 01:32:04.078
<i>As I prepare</i>

01:32:04.158 --> 01:32:09.914
<i>To lay down here alone, dear</i>

01:32:10.679 --> 01:32:14.717
<i>I can't help but to keep wishing</i>

01:32:14.797 --> 01:32:18.692
<i>That you were here</i>

01:32:19.327 --> 01:32:24.013
<i>I done you wrong but now you are gone</i>

01:32:24.093 --> 01:32:27.422
<i>What can I do?</i>

01:32:28.158 --> 01:32:32.381
<i>Don't make me live the rest of my life</i>

01:32:32.461 --> 01:32:35.478
<i>Forgetting you</i>

01:32:37.372 --> 01:32:41.380
<i>It's too bad I didn't realize</i>

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.503
<i>Until you were gone</i>

01:32:45.683 --> 01:32:48.363
<i>Just what it meant</i>

01:32:48.443 --> 01:32:53.510
<i>To have a love like you for my own</i>

01:32:54.316 --> 01:32:58.720
<i>But now that you've gone,
I know I can't go on</i>

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:02.080
<i>Living here without you</i>

01:33:03.085 --> 01:33:07.495
<i>Don't make me live the rest of my life</i>

01:33:07.575 --> 01:33:10.615
<i>Forgetting you</i>

01:33:11.947 --> 01:33:14.575
<i>Forgetting you</i>

01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:19.869
<i>It will be so hard, I know</i>

01:33:19.949 --> 01:33:23.846
<i>But, listen, baby, how can I forget you?</i>

01:33:25.387 --> 01:33:27.516
<i>Every day</i>

01:33:27.596 --> 01:33:29.760
<i>I love you more and more</i>

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.083
<i>Come back to me</i>

01:33:35.223 --> 01:33:37.513
<i>I'm lone and blue</i>

01:33:38.226 --> 01:33:42.461
<i>Don't make me live the rest of my life</i>

01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:44.972
<i>Forgetting you</i>

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:47.137
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:33:47.217 --> 01:33:49.430
<i>How can I forget you?</i>

01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.470
<i>When every day I love you
a little more and a little more</i>

01:33:56.288 --> 01:33:58.527
<i>How can I forget you?</i>

01:34:00.156 --> 01:34:03.369
<i>When you fill my heart with so much joy</i>

01:34:04.286 --> 01:34:06.774
<i>How can I forget you?</i>

01:34:08.448 --> 01:34:11.539
<i>When I love you all so much</i>

01:34:12.781 --> 01:34:15.073
<i>How can I forget you?</i>

01:34:16.866 --> 01:34:20.082
<i>When every day I need you by my side</i>

01:34:21.067 --> 01:34:23.698
<i>Oh, I love you, baby</i>

01:34:24.937 --> 01:34:27.819
<i>I love you from the bottom of my heart</i>

01:34:33.442 --> 01:34:35.426
<i>Tell me</i>

01:34:35.506 --> 01:34:37.994
