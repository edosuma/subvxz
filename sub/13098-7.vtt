00:01.667 --> 00:03.708
[instrumental music]

00:08.083 --> 00:10.417
The last poem you read tonight.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.208
(Mayan)
'"In the Light Of Two Moons."'

00:12.292 --> 00:14.417
Did I not hear
some of it when we were both..

00:14.500 --> 00:17.458
Both too young to know
anything..

00:17.542 --> 00:19.542
...about anything.

00:19.625 --> 00:22.792
We could only feel and wonder
what it all meant.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.583
But you recall correctly.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.625
I did start it then

00:28.708 --> 00:31.917
poor and groping for meaning.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.250
It has matured
and changed over the years.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.917
I finally knew
that it was ready last month.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.083
Tonight was
its first performance.

00:40.167 --> 00:42.833
- I remember it.
- I thought you might.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.750
Our lives were simpler then.

00:46.292 --> 00:50.333
Do you regret the choices
that you made...to be here?

00:50.417 --> 00:51.708
Sometimes.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.083
Only sometimes.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.292
You?

00:57.375 --> 00:59.708
I would be nothing
other than what I am.

01:02.542 --> 01:05.792
It's been a long day.

01:05.875 --> 01:07.292
- I have kept you too late.
- No.

01:07.375 --> 01:09.500
It is just that I have another
performance in the morning

01:09.583 --> 01:11.958
and after that I must prepare
for my journey to Earth.

01:12.042 --> 01:15.417
I hope humans appreciate what
riches of spirit you bring them.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.792
If they do not, I shall
retire to a doxhouse

01:18.875 --> 01:22.208
and devote my remaining years
to the songs of Heefa.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.583
It is good to
have you here, Mayan.

01:35.417 --> 01:37.500
Shall I walk you
to your quarters?

01:37.583 --> 01:39.500
Thank you, dear friend.

01:39.583 --> 01:43.333
But I'm sure your day begins
even earlier than mine.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.875
- Goodnight then.
- Goodnight.

01:45.958 --> 01:48.458
[instrumental music]

02:11.708 --> 02:13.000
Ah!

02:16.458 --> 02:18.458
Stay away from Earth, freak!

02:29.333 --> 02:33.000
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

02:33.083 --> 02:36.083
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

02:36.167 --> 02:39.417
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.875
Its goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

02:42.958 --> 02:44.375
where humans and aliens

02:44.458 --> 02:47.083
could work out
their differences peacefully.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.792
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:49.875 --> 02:55.167
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.042
Humans and aliens, wrapped in

02:57.125 --> 02:59.458
two million
five hundred thousand tons

02:59.542 --> 03:03.583
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

03:04.917 --> 03:07.042
It can be a dangerous place.

03:07.125 --> 03:10.208
But it's our last
best hope for peace.

03:10.292 --> 03:14.167
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.542
The year is 2258.

03:16.625 --> 03:20.042
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:20.125 --> 03:22.583
[instrumental music]

03:50.167 --> 03:52.708
[music continues]

03:58.875 --> 04:00.667
[instrumental music]

04:03.750 --> 04:07.167
This is an outrage, commander!
An outrage!

04:07.250 --> 04:10.583
Shaal Mayan is regarded as a
cultural treasure by my people.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.500
This brutal attack
affects not only her person

04:13.583 --> 04:15.542
but the soul of my entire race!

04:15.625 --> 04:17.542
We'll get whoever
is responsible. I promise.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.333
Will you promises
take away Mayan's pain

04:20.417 --> 04:22.208
her terror, her humiliation?

04:22.292 --> 04:24.625
I told her she should have an
escort during her stay.

04:24.708 --> 04:25.792
She refused.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.083
Mayan could not conceive

04:27.167 --> 04:28.667
of anyone wishing her harm.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.667
And there was a time,
Mr. Garibaldi

04:30.750 --> 04:32.458
'when one could walk through
Green Sector'

04:32.542 --> 04:33.833
'without need of escort!'

04:33.917 --> 04:35.958
I assure you,
we're doing everything we can

04:36.042 --> 04:37.750
to correct that, ambassador.

04:37.833 --> 04:40.667
Then you are required
to do better, commander.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.167
Much better!

04:44.333 --> 04:46.750
[instrumental music]

04:46.833 --> 04:48.625
(Garibaldi)
'This is the sixth attack
on a prominent alien'

04:48.708 --> 04:50.833
'in less than two weeks.
All with the same MO.'

04:50.917 --> 04:52.667
And it's not just happening
on Babylon 5

04:52.750 --> 04:54.708
Both Earth and Mars have had
a rash of similar incidents.

04:54.792 --> 04:55.667
Home Guard?

04:55.750 --> 04:56.958
That brand
is their calling card.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.500
And according to the latest
security update

04:58.583 --> 04:59.542
their numbers are growing daily

04:59.625 --> 05:00.583
along with a dozen or so

05:00.667 --> 05:01.708
other pro-Earth groups.

05:01.792 --> 05:02.833
Pro-Earth?

05:02.917 --> 05:04.042
They're nothing
but hate peddlers

05:04.125 --> 05:05.250
playing off fear and ignorance

05:05.333 --> 05:06.708
to turn human against alien.

05:06.792 --> 05:09.542
But I won't have it here,
not on Babylon 5.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.833
I want these scum, Michael.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.042
- I want them bad.
- I'll do my best.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.708
But the problem is
there's many who agree with them

05:14.792 --> 05:16.750
and even more
who just don't give a damn.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.542
Then make them give a damn.

05:21.958 --> 05:24.375
Commander Sinclair,
I have just been informed

05:24.458 --> 05:27.458
of the latest atrocity
committed by your people.

05:27.542 --> 05:30.208
My people did not attack
Shaal Mayan.

05:30.292 --> 05:33.208
But rest assured, whoever did
will be found and punished

05:33.292 --> 05:35.417
to the full extent of the law.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.542
I have no special love
for the Minbari or their poets.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.792
But I warn you, commander

05:39.875 --> 05:41.625
'if any Narn
is harmed in this way'

05:41.708 --> 05:43.750
there will be
bloody retribution!

05:43.833 --> 05:45.875
(Sinclair)
'And I warn you, ambassador'

05:45.958 --> 05:48.583
any disruption of Babylon 5
will be dealt with

05:48.667 --> 05:51.208
even if I have to throw
the entire Narn population

05:51.292 --> 05:53.125
into the brig.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.708
Now, if you'll excuse me.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.417
All I could see was a shadow.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.083
I'm sorry.

06:04.167 --> 06:07.625
This shadow, was it humanoid,
alien, big, small?

06:07.708 --> 06:12.250
It was a shadow.
That is all that I know.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.417
That, and the pain..

06:15.583 --> 06:17.625
...and this.

06:17.708 --> 06:18.833
Is there anyone on the station

06:18.917 --> 06:20.958
who might have
reason to harm you?

06:21.042 --> 06:25.625
Mr. Garibaldi,
I create and perform ti'la

06:25.708 --> 06:28.625
poem songs that attempt
to recall old memories

06:28.708 --> 06:31.458
and prompt new ideas.

06:31.542 --> 06:33.125
While a number of them
have provoked

06:33.208 --> 06:35.500
discussions of some heat..

06:37.000 --> 06:40.792
...I have never before
been stabbed and branded.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.250
Thank you for your time.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.833
- I could remove that mark..
- No.

06:50.958 --> 06:52.417
It is a lesson.

06:53.958 --> 06:55.750
One that should not be
forgotten.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.875
[instrumental music]

07:00.958 --> 07:03.125
(Susan)
'Babylon Control
to Centauri liner Carbo'

07:03.208 --> 07:04.500
we'll have someone
waiting at this end

07:04.583 --> 07:06.167
to take custody
of the detainees.

07:08.708 --> 07:09.833
Detainees? What kind?

07:09.917 --> 07:11.417
- Raiders? Hijackers?
- Unknown.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.333
All he said was that they didn't
appear to be dangerous

07:13.417 --> 07:16.167
and he wanted to hand them over
to someone of command rank.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.792
- So if you've got a minute..
- 'I don't.'

07:17.875 --> 07:19.500
Lieutenant commander,
I'm up to my eyeballs

07:19.583 --> 07:21.333
I got everyone of my people
looking into these attacks.

07:21.417 --> 07:24.000
- It will only take a minute.
- I don't have a minute.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.000
Well, neither do I.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.042
Unless of course you'd like me

07:26.125 --> 07:27.458
to get the commander to do it?

07:27.542 --> 07:28.917
Okay, alright.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.667
- I'll do it. No problem.
- Good.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.625
Just one quick stop
to make on the way.

07:32.708 --> 07:35.000
I found an illegal planter
in the garden last week.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.292
Someone was actually using

07:36.375 --> 07:38.208
our hydroponic system
to grow coffee.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.792
And as everyone knows the garden
is to be used

07:39.875 --> 07:42.250
only for fruits,
vegetables, grains

07:42.333 --> 07:43.708
so I figured I'd just stop by

07:43.792 --> 07:45.833
and rip it
right out of that planter.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.542
It's too bad. The beans looked
just about ripe.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.833
And coffee is so expensive
to import.

07:50.917 --> 07:52.958
Mr. Garibaldi.

07:53.042 --> 07:54.917
I think I'll take a walk,
and while I'm out

07:55.000 --> 07:57.083
I might as well stop by
and pick up the detainees.

07:57.167 --> 07:59.542
- You're a vicious man.
- I'm head of security.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.250
It's in the job description.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.667
Let go!
I am a Centauri citizen.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.250
You have no right
to manhandle me.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.417
We demand to see
Ambassador Cotto!

08:12.500 --> 08:13.833
Lead them to Blue-5
and make sure

08:13.917 --> 08:17.042
the Centauri representative
is informed.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.917
Susan.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.458
It's been a long time.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.500
It's been eight years, Malcolm.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.000
What are you doing on Babylon 5?

08:31.083 --> 08:33.167
I'm looking for something.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.458
Something I never
stopped wanting.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.500
I have to go. I have duties.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.042
(Malcom)
'Same old Susan.'

08:41.000 --> 08:42.083
Duty first.

08:42.167 --> 08:44.583
That's right. Enjoy your stay.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.375
But you said in your letters
that you were the ambassador.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.375
It's a little difficult
to explain right now.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.750
This is a great
disappointment to us, cousin.

08:56.833 --> 09:00.292
Alright, Sinclair,
what is it this time?

09:00.375 --> 09:02.917
I suggest
you ask Ambassador Cotto.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.083
Who?

09:04.167 --> 09:06.542
Ambassador Mollari,
may I present

09:06.625 --> 09:09.250
'Aria Tensus
and my cousin, Kiron Maray.'

09:09.333 --> 09:11.625
'They arrived from
Centauri Prime today'

09:11.708 --> 09:13.958
and were taken into custody
immediately

09:14.042 --> 09:15.292
by Earthforce security!

09:15.375 --> 09:17.875
Commander, can you explain
this affront

09:17.958 --> 09:19.292
to our noble citizens?

09:19.375 --> 09:22.458
Your noble citizens
had stolen credit chips.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.583
Oh. I see.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.500
(Sinclair)
'Since they are Centauri
I'm going to release them'

09:26.583 --> 09:28.958
into your custody pending
further investigation

09:29.042 --> 09:30.000
of the charges.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.917
What am I supposed to do
with them?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.250
You're always saying the
Centauri are an advanced race.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.917
You figure it out.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.458
[indistinct chatter]

09:50.417 --> 09:54.333
So...you do take a break
every now and then.

09:54.417 --> 09:57.375
- Actually, my shift just ended.
- Then maybe we can talk.

09:59.458 --> 10:04.208
There was a time when you and I
would spend entire evenings

10:04.292 --> 10:08.083
just talking, when we weren't..

10:10.542 --> 10:12.833
That was a long time ago,
Malcolm.

10:12.917 --> 10:16.333
A different place.
A different me.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.125
All the more reason
to start over.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.292
- I'm tired. I have to go.
- Susan.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.917
Malcom, it's been eight years.
Let's take it slow, alright?

10:31.292 --> 10:33.375
[instrumental music]

10:35.500 --> 10:38.333
So when their families
arranged marriages for them

10:38.417 --> 10:39.667
they fled here.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.708
Yes, but why?

10:41.792 --> 10:44.875
I'm to marry the ugliest woman
on Centauri Prime.

10:44.958 --> 10:46.542
And Aria is betrothed to a man

10:46.625 --> 10:48.500
who is old enough
to be her grandfather!

10:48.583 --> 10:50.583
Ugly and old, yes?

10:50.667 --> 10:53.750
Then their families
must be both rich and powerful.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.625
I commend your parents
on fine choices.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.875
But I still don't see
the problem!

10:58.958 --> 11:00.833
We don't want to
marry anyone else!

11:00.917 --> 11:02.583
We want to
marry each other.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.417
- We love each other.
- Love?

11:06.500 --> 11:09.292
What does love have to do
with marriage?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.750
My dear, beautiful children.

11:22.833 --> 11:26.500
'Consider for a moment
what you are doing.'

11:26.583 --> 11:28.292
For a thousand years

11:28.375 --> 11:31.208
marriages have been arranged
among our people.

11:31.292 --> 11:35.375
Marriages which meld
the noble houses together

11:35.458 --> 11:39.583
and-and keep the fabric
of the republic strong.

11:39.667 --> 11:44.208
Sometimes, these marriages
call for sacrifice.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.083
'Great sacrifice.'

11:48.167 --> 11:52.292
But we make this sacrifice

11:52.375 --> 11:57.042
because this is what it means
to be Centauri!

11:57.125 --> 12:01.125
If you deny this tradition,
you lose the very thing

12:01.208 --> 12:05.833
which makes you what you are.
Do you understand?

12:05.917 --> 12:07.333
But it's so unfair!

12:08.417 --> 12:09.583
[sighs]

12:16.458 --> 12:17.833
Mr. Roberts, are you aware

12:17.917 --> 12:20.125
of Babylon 5's regulations
regarding weapons?

12:20.208 --> 12:22.083
I got a right to defend myself!

12:22.167 --> 12:25.125
You've seen some the things
that walk around this place.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.625
Some of them could
tear a man's head off.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.292
Is that what you were doing
the other night?

12:29.375 --> 12:32.083
- Defending yourself?
- What do you mean?

12:32.167 --> 12:33.833
Shaal Mayan was attacked
last night

12:33.917 --> 12:36.000
and there's traces of
fresh blood on your knife.

12:36.083 --> 12:39.875
It's mine.
I cut myself opening a crate.

12:39.958 --> 12:42.958
- Ever hear of the Home Guard?
- Yeah, sure.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.958
If you ask me,
they got the right idea.

12:45.042 --> 12:48.208
It's about time we human beings
stood up for our rights.

12:48.292 --> 12:52.792
Damn aliens are ruining
everything for us.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.208
Book him for carrying
illegal weapon

12:54.292 --> 12:56.625
and run a DNA check
on that blood.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.292
What the hell is this crap? I--

12:58.375 --> 12:59.500
Let me tell you something,
creep.

12:59.583 --> 13:00.708
I don't like your attitude.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.250
And if the blood on that
toothpick of yours

13:02.333 --> 13:04.208
'matches Mayan's, I'll give you
over to the Minbari'

13:04.292 --> 13:06.333
and let them play dice
with your eyeballs.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.083
I don't know what's worse

13:08.167 --> 13:10.667
damn aliens or the traitors
who suck up to them

13:10.750 --> 13:12.208
over their own kind.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.792
(Garibaldi)
'Get him out of here!'

13:19.125 --> 13:20.417
(female #2)
'Earth Alliance
transport Wolfbay'

13:20.500 --> 13:22.125
'you may proceed to jumpgate.'

13:22.208 --> 13:24.083
(male #1)
'Roger, Babylon Control.'

13:24.167 --> 13:26.750
[instrumental music]

13:43.458 --> 13:46.125
Ambassador Kosh,
I hadn't heard from you

13:46.208 --> 13:48.792
so I thought I'd make sure
you'd been informed.

13:48.875 --> 13:52.000
There have been several
recent attacks on non-humanoids.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.875
We are conducting a thorough
investigating

13:53.958 --> 13:57.333
and hope to have it
wrapped up soon.

13:57.417 --> 13:58.583
Good.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.083
Meanwhile, it might be helpful

14:00.167 --> 14:03.083
if you spoke with
the other ambassadors.

14:05.875 --> 14:10.042
We take no interest
in the affairs of others.

14:11.583 --> 14:12.750
Well, I hope you'll reconsider.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.542
If you could give us a hand,
we..

14:15.625 --> 14:17.042
Yes?

14:18.833 --> 14:22.625
Nothing.
We'll respect your wishes.

14:22.708 --> 14:24.833
That's quite a viewer.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.542
I've never seen anything
quite like it before.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.750
- What is it?
- Efficient.

14:29.833 --> 14:34.458
Those are images from my world.
If I may ask, what are you..

14:34.542 --> 14:38.042
- I am studying.
- Studying what?

14:40.083 --> 14:41.375
Ambassador?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.958
[instrumental music]

15:07.375 --> 15:08.625
[sniffing]

15:13.500 --> 15:15.958
[music continues]

15:20.042 --> 15:21.750
(Susan)
'Any word yet
from Earth Central?'

15:21.833 --> 15:24.500
No. Funny.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.417
There's something I've been
thinking about it all day.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.750
And I can't
get it out of my head.

15:27.833 --> 15:28.958
What's that?

15:29.042 --> 15:30.167
When Earth Central
assigned you here

15:30.250 --> 15:31.417
did they brief on what happened

15:31.500 --> 15:32.833
when Ambassador Kosh arrived?

15:32.917 --> 15:34.333
They just said a radical
organization

15:34.417 --> 15:36.750
within the Minbari military cast
tried to assassinate him.

15:36.833 --> 15:39.875
They used poisoned
administered through the hand.

15:39.958 --> 15:41.458
I was talking with Kosh earlier

15:41.542 --> 15:44.500
and I remembered something
I never could quite figure out.

15:44.583 --> 15:45.792
Kosh wears an encounter suit

15:45.875 --> 15:47.333
to protect him
from our atmosphere

15:47.417 --> 15:49.667
so how did the poison
get in to his system?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.833
His hand should've been
completely covered.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.875
Vorlons are very secretive.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.417
And they don't want anyone know
what they look like

15:55.500 --> 15:57.958
what they breathe,
or how their biology works.

15:58.042 --> 16:00.167
I mean, who knows how much
that suit is really necessary

16:00.250 --> 16:01.958
and how much is just camouflaged

16:02.042 --> 16:03.708
to keep us from seeing
what's inside?

16:03.792 --> 16:06.333
The only person who does know
is Dr. Ben Kyle

16:06.417 --> 16:08.375
who saved Kosh's life.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.042
Since he's bound by doctor's
oath of confidentiality

16:11.125 --> 16:12.250
he never told me what he saw

16:12.333 --> 16:14.125
when he opened
that encounter suit.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.542
Strangely enough,
right after that

16:17.625 --> 16:18.792
he was transferred to Earth

16:18.875 --> 16:20.792
to work directly
with the president.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.708
And our first telepath
Lyta Alexander

16:22.792 --> 16:25.125
the only member of the Psi Corps
to scan a Vorlon

16:25.208 --> 16:27.208
was transferred back
a week later.

16:27.292 --> 16:29.250
You think there's a connection?

16:29.333 --> 16:31.917
I don't know. Maybe.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.083
[instrumental music]

16:35.292 --> 16:37.542
Do you have any idea
how much trouble

16:37.625 --> 16:39.792
these lovebirds of yours
have given me?

16:39.875 --> 16:42.792
I've already had a dozen
messages from Centauri Prime.

16:42.875 --> 16:46.625
Yes, their families are outraged
and it's my head they're after!

16:46.708 --> 16:49.250
- What are you going to do?
- What am I going to do?

16:49.333 --> 16:52.333
The only thing I can do,
send them home where they belong

16:52.417 --> 16:54.250
and hope they come
to their senses!

16:54.333 --> 16:56.667
- But they love each other.
- Love.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.250
Pah! Overrated!

16:59.333 --> 17:01.292
Here, look.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.792
These are my three wives.

17:04.875 --> 17:09.458
Pestilence, famine and death.

17:09.542 --> 17:12.583
Do you think I married them
for their personalities?

17:12.667 --> 17:16.417
'Their personalities could
shatter entire planets.'

17:16.500 --> 17:18.917
Arranged marriages, everyone.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.208
But they worked out.
They inspired me.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.833
Knowing that they were waiting
at home for me

17:24.917 --> 17:28.667
is what keeps me here
75 light-years away.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.125
But, ambassador, they're just
going to run away again.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.292
But happily,
that is not my problem.

17:35.375 --> 17:39.292
Now, you go
find your little lovebirds

17:39.375 --> 17:40.875
and tell them to be ready.

17:40.958 --> 17:43.667
There's a transport leaving
for Centauri Prime tonight

17:43.750 --> 17:46.000
and I want them on it.

17:46.083 --> 17:48.417
If you need me,
I'll be in the casino.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.250
[instrumental music]

17:57.167 --> 17:58.417
Commander.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.083
The Abbai delegation is
preparing to dock.

18:02.167 --> 18:04.750
Have a liaison officer
meet them at customs.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.333
You wanted to see me, commander?

18:09.417 --> 18:12.083
I hear you have a suspect
in the assault of Mayan?

18:12.167 --> 18:13.167
Had.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.625
DNA scan showed
the blood on his knife

18:14.708 --> 18:16.000
was his own just like he said.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.667
He sure fit the profile, though.
A real hate freak.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.833
- You let him go?
- Under red level surveillance.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.375
I could've held him
on the weapon charge

18:22.458 --> 18:24.375
but I think he'd be
more useful to us running loose.

18:24.458 --> 18:26.000
He's a logical recruit
for the Home Guard.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.167
- Meet attracting maggots.
- Good idea.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.458
- What else have you turned up?
- I haven't had much time.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.208
Since the attack on Mayan
there's been fights

18:32.292 --> 18:33.792
breaking out all over
the station.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.542
Things are getting ugly
out there, commander.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.542
That's exactly what
the Home Guard wants.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.667
If they can turn Babylon 5
into a war zone

18:39.750 --> 18:42.292
everything we've worked for here
will be destroyed.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.667
We better wrap this one up
quickly, Michael.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.000
I know.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.667
[instrumental music]

18:51.708 --> 18:53.708
Oh, we had some good times
together.

18:53.792 --> 18:55.042
[laughing]

18:55.125 --> 18:56.625
Yeah, we sure did.

18:59.292 --> 19:02.375
Tell me, do you, um..

19:02.458 --> 19:04.667
...do you ever regret
leaving me?

19:05.250 --> 19:06.500
Regret?

19:07.917 --> 19:08.958
No.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.458
Io was a great career move.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.375
It opened a lot of doors.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.542
And serving there
was very exciting for me..

19:17.625 --> 19:21.208
...even if I did cry myself
to sleep the first few months.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.292
I never wanted to let you go.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.542
I feel the same today.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.917
Malcom, I'm still committed
to my career.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.833
And you know what that means.

19:31.917 --> 19:34.917
And I can accept that now.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.667
Which is, uh...why
I'm going into business here.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.917
What?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.167
I do believe
this is the very first time

19:42.250 --> 19:43.708
I've ever surprised you.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.250
But you're not serious,
are you?

19:45.333 --> 19:46.875
Absolutely.

19:46.958 --> 19:51.417
In fact, I've already, um,
secured an office and quarters.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.625
'All I need is
a few more clients.'

19:53.708 --> 19:56.250
I hope that you might be able to
help me with that.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.625
But the important thing

19:58.708 --> 20:00.833
is that we'll be together again.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.250
Right?

20:03.333 --> 20:05.917
[instrumental music]

20:26.125 --> 20:27.083

20:27.167 --> 20:29.625

20:32.875 --> 20:34.792
He can ID me. Burn him!

20:34.875 --> 20:36.125
No!

20:38.208 --> 20:40.333
(Vir)
'Kiron! Aria!'

20:40.417 --> 20:42.417
Let's get out of here!

20:48.917 --> 20:50.208
Oh, my..

20:50.292 --> 20:51.542
'Kiron.'

20:55.667 --> 20:57.000
(Stephen)
'Boy's in a coma.'

20:57.083 --> 20:59.333
'Thoracic wound,
PPG at close range.'

20:59.417 --> 21:02.083
He's in intensive care
in Medlab 2.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.833
- How's Aria?
- Stunned with a shock stick.

21:04.917 --> 21:07.000
He's a little bruised
and a lot scared.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.417
Physically, she'll be fine.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.333
Does she remember
anything about the attack?

21:10.417 --> 21:11.833
- 'No.'
- And the boy?

21:11.917 --> 21:13.833
He might be able to
identify his attacker

21:13.917 --> 21:16.500
if he comes out of the coma.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.000
Garibaldi.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.458

'Chief,
we've got a major disturbance'

21:19.542 --> 21:21.542
'in Central Corridor,
Brown Sector.'

21:24.250 --> 21:26.750
(G'Kar)
'We can no longer stand idly by'

21:26.833 --> 21:30.417
as our peoples are slaughtered
by these cowardly humans!

21:30.500 --> 21:34.958
We must fight back with
every means at our disposal!

21:35.042 --> 21:36.583
(male #3)
'He's right!'

21:36.667 --> 21:39.583
[indistinct chatter]

21:39.667 --> 21:41.958
Is there some problem,
Ambassador G'Kar?

21:42.042 --> 21:43.792
Problem, indeed!

21:43.875 --> 21:46.333
Eight non-humans
brutally attacked

21:46.417 --> 21:48.208
in the space of two weeks.

21:48.292 --> 21:51.542
And you have yet to make
even a single arrest.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.542
We have a good lead
in the latest incident and..

21:53.625 --> 21:56.208
Spare us your usual platitudes,
commander.

21:56.292 --> 22:00.208
You know very well why these
crimes remain unsolved.

22:00.292 --> 22:03.292
It is because the perpetrators
are human!

22:03.375 --> 22:05.625
[clamoring]

22:07.792 --> 22:09.708
I want you out of here,
commander. Now!

22:09.792 --> 22:12.042
To hell with that. I'm not going
anywhere until they listen.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.542
We've both seen mobs before

22:13.625 --> 22:15.083
and anything you say
will only make them hotter.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.917
Now, get outta here,
and let me do my job.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.333
I promise, I'll be gentle.

22:21.250 --> 22:24.208
So this is your response,
is it, Sinclair?

22:24.292 --> 22:28.667
So much for Babylon 5's
highly vaunted justice!

22:28.750 --> 22:31.083
(Michael)
'Justice, you're about to get
a firsthand taste of, G'Kar.'

22:31.167 --> 22:33.542
Starting with a charge of
inciting to riot.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.833
Or you can go back to your
quarters

22:34.917 --> 22:37.042
and we'll call it
a misunderstanding.

22:39.167 --> 22:40.625
(Michael)
'Alright, move him out.'

22:40.708 --> 22:43.250
[instrumental music]

22:45.667 --> 22:47.417
You.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.625
You, I hear.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.083
- You one who hunts.
- Out of my way!

Thank you.
I had a lovely evening.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.000
Well, I was hoping

23:44.083 --> 23:47.333
that it wasn't over..

23:47.417 --> 23:48.458
Yet.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.000

- It's duty.

[clears throat]
Ivanova here.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.042
(Sinclair)
'We've had a near riot
in Central.'

24:04.125 --> 24:07.000
- 'I need you in briefing room.'
- I'm on my way.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.000
[intercom beeping]

24:09.083 --> 24:11.250
- You have to go.
- Did he say there was a riot?

24:11.333 --> 24:13.708
Malcolm, out!

24:13.792 --> 24:15.917
Um,
catch you on your next break?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.042
[chuckles]

24:17.125 --> 24:18.167
Yes.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.042
[door whirring]

24:22.958 --> 24:25.042
[door whirring]

24:25.125 --> 24:28.375
Situation's cooled down some,
but we've had a few incidents..

24:28.458 --> 24:30.083
Including one involving my
old pal Roberts.

24:30.167 --> 24:31.375
How serious?

24:31.458 --> 24:32.958
Well, he's gonna be spendin'
a few days in Medlab.

24:33.042 --> 24:34.583
Luckily,
we had him on Red surveillance.

24:34.667 --> 24:36.250
'We nabbed the perps
before they killed him.'

24:36.333 --> 24:37.375
Keep a lid on it.

24:37.458 --> 24:39.042
This could provoke even
more trouble.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.958
I could strangle that damn
G'Kar.

24:42.042 --> 24:43.625
Hm. Love your new look.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.167
Considering the situation,
Garibaldi

24:45.250 --> 24:46.333
I think you'd have something
on your mind

24:46.417 --> 24:47.375
other than my look.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.417
- Sir?
- Let's begin.

24:54.042 --> 24:55.917
[door whirring]

24:59.792 --> 25:02.667
Aria. I'm so sorry.

25:04.583 --> 25:08.125
My dear child, don't worry.
Kiron will be fine.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.750
Dr. Franklin is a veritable
wizard.

25:10.833 --> 25:13.792
- They won't let me be near him.
- 'Of course not.'

25:13.875 --> 25:15.583
But he wouldn't want that.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.417
If he senses I'm here..

25:18.500 --> 25:19.917
...he'll recover.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.833
I know it.

25:21.917 --> 25:23.375
Can't you do something about it,
ambassador?

25:23.458 --> 25:25.583
(Londo)
'Go back to your suite
and rest.'

25:25.667 --> 25:28.208
There's nothing you can do here.

25:28.292 --> 25:29.417
I'm not leaving Kiron.

25:30.625 --> 25:31.667
Ambassador.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.417
You should listen to the girl.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.000
We Minbari consider love
a most potent force for healing.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.208
She cares deeply for him.

25:45.292 --> 25:48.458
Such feelings can turn the tide
when all else fails.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.292
Oh, I see.

25:50.375 --> 25:53.208
And if he dies despite this
great power of--

25:53.292 --> 25:56.292
If he dies,
she will suffer enormous grief.

25:56.375 --> 25:59.458
But every moment together will
make her grief a little less.

25:59.542 --> 26:03.125
I would expect such logic
from a poet.

26:03.208 --> 26:06.958
What can a Minbari know
about Centauri feeling?

26:07.042 --> 26:10.292
Ambassador, I have traveled far
and seen much.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.375
And what I have seen
tells me that

26:12.458 --> 26:15.042
all sentient beings are
best defined

26:15.125 --> 26:18.458
by their capacity
and their need for love.

26:18.542 --> 26:21.292
And she will learn to live
without it!

26:21.375 --> 26:22.417
As you did?

26:34.250 --> 26:35.417
You wanted to see me?

26:35.500 --> 26:37.083
I've been keeping up
surveillance on Roberts

26:37.167 --> 26:39.333
and he just had an interesting
visitor.

26:39.417 --> 26:43.667
Computer, play surveillance tape
971, count 16.

26:43.750 --> 26:44.917
(computer)
'Commencing.'

26:50.958 --> 26:55.292
'I know that man. He was in
Ivanova's quarters last night.'

26:55.375 --> 26:59.000
(Malcolm)
Mr. Roberts?
I'm Malcolm Biggs.

26:59.083 --> 27:01.833
'What's happened to you is..'

27:01.917 --> 27:03.458
'Well, it's a disgrace.'

27:04.542 --> 27:06.208
Tell me about it.

27:06.292 --> 27:10.417
There are some of us who don't
like what's happening here.

27:10.500 --> 27:14.250
Alien ambassadors
setting policy for humans.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.417
'Alien workers taking jobs
from human beings.'

27:17.500 --> 27:20.708
Inhuman criminals preying on

27:20.792 --> 27:23.875
decent people like yourself.

27:23.958 --> 27:25.958
We want to put a stop to that.

27:27.500 --> 27:31.583
And we think you can help us.

27:31.667 --> 27:33.667
(computer)
'End of recording.'

27:36.250 --> 27:37.333
[computer beeping]

27:38.708 --> 27:40.375
I never would've dreamed..

27:40.458 --> 27:42.125
A man can change a lot
in eight years.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.833
There's no reason
you should've known.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.833
Exactly what is it you wanted me
to do, commander?

27:47.917 --> 27:49.250
(Sinclair)
'Introduce me.'

27:49.333 --> 27:51.417
Tell me I'm not happy about
all these aliens

27:51.500 --> 27:53.042
forcing themselves on Earth.

27:53.125 --> 27:56.958
Groups like this always like to
recruit friends in high places.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.625
If they accept me, it could give
us a chance to nail them all

27:59.708 --> 28:01.250
before they do any more damage.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.083
Very well.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.667
- On one condition.
- Name it.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.667
I wanna be there
when you take them down.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.750
[door whirring]

28:15.833 --> 28:18.083
There's a diplomatic reception
at the council chambers tonight.

28:18.167 --> 28:21.042
That might be a good way
to get the ball rolling.

28:21.125 --> 28:22.208
As you wish.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.500
Ambassador, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

28:49.583 --> 28:51.292
Yes.

28:51.375 --> 28:52.833
Yes, what do you want?

28:52.917 --> 28:55.375
- To tell you something.
- Well?

28:56.958 --> 28:58.042
You..

28:59.375 --> 29:02.125
- You-you-you were wrong.
- What?

29:02.208 --> 29:04.458
My cousin and Aria wanted to
be together

29:04.542 --> 29:06.167
because they love each other.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.500
Now, would that destroy the
great Centauri Republic?

29:09.583 --> 29:11.667
We cannot turn our back on
tradition.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.083
Oh, damn tradition!

29:14.167 --> 29:17.750
Kiron may die because
our glorious tradition

29:17.833 --> 29:20.750
values wealth and power
over love.

29:20.833 --> 29:23.417
My shoes are too tight.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.000
Excuse me?

29:26.083 --> 29:28.625
Something my father said.

29:28.708 --> 29:32.333
He was...old.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.042
Very old at the time.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.917
I went into his room

29:39.000 --> 29:43.417
and he was sitting alone
in the dark, crying.

29:44.958 --> 29:47.583
'So I asked him what was wrong.'

29:47.667 --> 29:48.750
And he said..

29:51.083 --> 29:54.292
"My shoes are too tight

29:54.375 --> 29:57.000
"but it doesn't matter

29:57.083 --> 30:01.417
because I have forgotten
how to dance."

30:01.500 --> 30:04.125
'I never understood
what that meant until now.'

30:06.958 --> 30:09.000
My shoes are too tight..

30:12.500 --> 30:14.708
...and I have forgotten how to
dance.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.750
I don't understand.

30:27.208 --> 30:28.417
Nor should you.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.792
[instrumental music]

30:45.875 --> 30:47.250
Commander Sinclair.

30:49.917 --> 30:52.250
May I introduce Mila Shar.

30:52.333 --> 30:55.375
Head of the agricultural
delegation from Abba Four.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.417
We look forward to
studying your

30:59.500 --> 31:02.292
hydroponic cultivation methods,
commander.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.708
I understand
they've been most successful.

31:04.792 --> 31:07.333
They should be.
The best technos from Earth

31:07.417 --> 31:08.583
set up the system for us.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.000
It's state of the art.

31:10.083 --> 31:13.208
I trust your security is
equally as efficient?

31:13.292 --> 31:14.833
Absolutely.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.292
We understand there have been
several attacks

31:17.375 --> 31:19.000
'on non-humans lately.'

31:19.083 --> 31:22.125
Naturally, I'm concerned about
the welfare of our delegates.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.792
Don't be. We have everything
under control.

31:24.875 --> 31:28.375
Uh, but wasn't a Centauri youth

31:28.458 --> 31:30.833
seriously injured
just last night?

31:30.917 --> 31:32.042
He'll recover.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.167
(Sinclair)
'They're nervous.'

31:45.250 --> 31:46.542
(Malcolm)
'About what?'

31:46.625 --> 31:48.833
The recent attacks on
non-humans.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.208
They're afraid they'll be next.

31:50.292 --> 31:52.208
What if they are?
I served on the line

31:52.292 --> 31:53.958
and we had a motto there..

31:54.042 --> 31:56.542
'"The only good alien
is a dead alien."'

31:56.625 --> 31:58.625
It was true then,
it's true now.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.917
The job description says
I have to play diplomat.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.875
It doesn't mean I have to
like it.

32:02.958 --> 32:05.500
[dramatic music]

32:11.917 --> 32:15.333
- Were you in the war, Biggs?
- Well, no, I missed it.

32:15.417 --> 32:16.542
Sit down. Sit down.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.500
Let me tell you something.

32:18.583 --> 32:19.833
I fought.

32:19.917 --> 32:23.000
My best friends died.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.708
And we won.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.833
Not because we out-fought them.

32:26.917 --> 32:28.625
Not because we were
luckier than them

32:28.708 --> 32:30.583
or stronger than them,
or smarter than them.

32:30.667 --> 32:33.167
'We won because the damn Minbari
let us win.'

32:34.542 --> 32:37.125
You know what that victory
tasted like?

32:37.208 --> 32:39.333
Ashes.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.583
You'd be surprised how many
times I've heard that.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.667
There's a movement
back on Earth.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.250
It's growing, gaining in support

32:49.333 --> 32:52.417
from people just like you.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.000
So I've heard.

32:55.083 --> 32:59.083
We want to put Earth back
at the center of the universe.

32:59.167 --> 33:01.208
Our universe.

33:01.292 --> 33:03.375
Get rid of alien influences.

33:03.458 --> 33:04.958
Get rid of aliens!

33:05.042 --> 33:06.917
Put Earth first!

33:07.000 --> 33:10.542
We must get back to our roots.

33:10.625 --> 33:14.875
'Let's let humans be humans!'

33:15.958 --> 33:17.250
Who's we?

33:30.042 --> 33:31.125
Friends of mine.

33:32.167 --> 33:34.208
And perhaps soon of yours.

33:35.625 --> 33:36.750
'I want you to meet them.'

33:38.250 --> 33:39.333
Both of you.

33:41.083 --> 33:42.625
I'd like that.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.750
Yes.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.250
Of course,
we must be discreet.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.250
Not every human agrees
with our stance.

33:49.333 --> 33:53.417
So I'd like a small gesture.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.292
To show where your sentiments
lie.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.333
What sort of gesture?

33:57.417 --> 34:01.917
Something to put every alien
on this station in their place!

34:04.375 --> 34:05.458
To Earth!

34:08.167 --> 34:09.250
[glasses clink]

34:12.500 --> 34:14.875
[instrumental music]

34:16.375 --> 34:17.833
I know you've all been concerned

34:17.917 --> 34:20.458
about the recent violence
against aliens onboard.

34:20.542 --> 34:21.625
And you will be relieved to know

34:21.708 --> 34:23.583
there is no longer any danger.

34:23.667 --> 34:26.292
Good!
You've arrested the criminals!

34:26.375 --> 34:30.250
- But why weren't we informed?
- Mr. Garibaldi.

34:30.333 --> 34:31.667
We've good reason to believe
the perpetrators

34:31.750 --> 34:33.042
have fled back to Earth.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.792
Naturally,
we've alerted Earthforce there.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.250
Then you have identified them?

34:36.333 --> 34:38.625
I'm afraid that information
is classified at the moment.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.833
Why is it classified?

34:39.917 --> 34:42.667
Do you think we are pouchlings,
commander?

34:42.750 --> 34:45.833
Are we really to believe that
these humans are simply gone?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.083
I for one,
do not accept a word of it!

34:48.167 --> 34:51.500
- Neither do I!
- 'Believe whatever you like.'

34:51.583 --> 34:55.667
The fact is the investigation
is over! Thank you.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.792
[clamoring]

34:59.792 --> 35:00.875
Dr. Franklin!

35:03.917 --> 35:05.958
Ah, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:06.042 --> 35:07.292
[sighing]

35:07.375 --> 35:08.458
Welcome back.

35:09.417 --> 35:10.500
How do you feel?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.333
Tired.

35:13.417 --> 35:16.042
Well, that'll pass.
When you feel up to it

35:16.125 --> 35:19.333
Mr. Garibaldi has some questions
about the people who shot you.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.667
And Ambassador Mollari was
askin' about you.

35:21.750 --> 35:24.167
I think he wants to have a long
talk with both of you.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.167
Commander,
I just heard from Malcolm.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.000
- He's set the meeting.
- Where is it?

35:38.083 --> 35:40.292
He won't tell me. He'll meet us
in the Zocalo in half an hour

35:40.375 --> 35:41.333
and take us there.

35:41.417 --> 35:42.500
We're to be unarmed.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.792
Looks like our boy's being
cagey.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.167
I expected that.

35:46.250 --> 35:48.083
We'll link into the security net
so you can monitor us.

35:48.167 --> 35:50.500
If they suspect we've been
lying, this could be a trap.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.792
I'll be all ears.

35:51.875 --> 35:54.333
You need us, we'll there.
Good luck.

35:54.417 --> 35:57.625
Dr. Franklin says you'll be able
to travel in a few days.

35:57.708 --> 35:59.208
I've made all the arrangements.

35:59.292 --> 36:01.375
- But--
- Please, no more arguments.

36:01.458 --> 36:05.625
You will return to Centauri
Prime as is your duty!

36:05.708 --> 36:08.417
However, upon arrival

36:08.500 --> 36:12.417
you'll be met by Andilo Mollari,
my second cousin.

36:12.500 --> 36:16.083
'He will escort you to his
family estate in the capital'

36:16.167 --> 36:19.750
where you will enter into
a period of fosterage

36:19.833 --> 36:22.167
until you are of adult age.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.792
- I don't understand.
- Fosterage?

36:23.875 --> 36:26.250
A fairly common practice
in the old days.

36:26.333 --> 36:29.833
And though seldom done nowadays,
the law still allows it.

36:29.917 --> 36:32.917
(Londo)
'Vir, very impressive.
I can see you've been studying.'

36:33.000 --> 36:37.125
Good. You will live with Andilo
and his wives. All good people.

36:37.208 --> 36:40.125
And they will instruct you,
in among other things

36:40.208 --> 36:44.167
'proper decorum
for Centauris of your rank.'

36:44.250 --> 36:46.125
But our parents,
they'll object.

36:46.208 --> 36:47.542
I doubt it.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.917
You see,
Andilo is a very powerful man.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.375
And it is a great honor to be
fostered by his family.

36:53.458 --> 36:56.875
'To object would be to defy
all tradition.'

36:56.958 --> 36:58.667
But what will become of us?

36:58.750 --> 37:02.167
You will study our culture,
learning all you can of it.

37:02.250 --> 37:05.917
Then, when you are old enough,
Andilo will give you permission

37:06.000 --> 37:11.125
to decide for yourselves
whom you wish to marry!

37:12.167 --> 37:13.792
Even if it's only for love?

37:13.875 --> 37:15.583
[chuckling]

37:15.667 --> 37:18.792
- If you insist!
- Ah! Thank you.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.250
Alright, enough.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.292
You two need to rest.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.125
Now, we'll talk more later.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.083
Ambassador.

37:26.917 --> 37:27.958
Why?

37:28.583 --> 37:29.708
Because..

37:29.792 --> 37:32.333
...you are still children.

37:32.417 --> 37:35.958
And children should be
allowed to dance.

37:37.500 --> 37:38.500
Vir.

37:38.583 --> 37:39.917
[chuckling]

37:40.000 --> 37:41.083
[door whirring]

37:49.792 --> 37:52.875
[computer beeping]

37:54.625 --> 37:56.292
They're entering Cargo Bay 5.

37:57.917 --> 37:59.417
This is it.

37:59.500 --> 38:00.583
[door clanks]

38:11.333 --> 38:12.458
Where are the others?

38:13.292 --> 38:15.167
Already here, commander.

38:21.750 --> 38:24.083
[swishing]

38:27.500 --> 38:30.375
Worth, activate the jammer.
Alvarez, on scan.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.708
[scanner beeping]

38:32.792 --> 38:36.208
- We don't want to be disturbed.
- 'I'm impressed.'

38:37.625 --> 38:39.167
What are those things?

38:39.250 --> 38:42.917
Black-light camouflage,
developed by Earthforce.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.875
'They're still under wraps
in R and D

38:45.958 --> 38:50.000
but our friends got us some
prototypes.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.125
We have friends everywhere.

38:52.208 --> 38:54.208
'We hope that you'll be
one of them.'

38:54.292 --> 38:58.167
- I'll help any way I can.
- 'We're counting on it.'

38:58.250 --> 39:02.417
- Worth, is the jammer up?
- Perimeter secured.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.125
Damn! They jammed us.
Let's move.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.417
[static]

39:05.500 --> 39:09.833
The recent attacks on Earth,
Mars and here

39:09.917 --> 39:11.542
were just a prelude.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.750
In two days' time

39:13.833 --> 39:16.792
there'll be a mass
assassination.

39:16.875 --> 39:19.625
In one night, we'll take out

39:19.708 --> 39:22.875
the four major ambassadors
stationed here.

39:22.958 --> 39:24.875
Mollari, Delenn

39:24.958 --> 39:27.375
'G'Kar and Kosh.'

39:28.333 --> 39:30.542
Their deaths will be a signal

39:30.625 --> 39:33.583
to terminate the ambassadors
on Earth.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.417
But the scale of it, I mean

39:35.500 --> 39:37.000
you would need hundreds
of people.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.750
Well, as Alvarez said,
we got friends everywhere.

39:40.833 --> 39:43.500
(Michael)
Clear it out, clear it out!
Coming through, coming through!

39:43.583 --> 39:44.583
Clear it out!

39:44.667 --> 39:47.708
[dramatic music]

39:48.667 --> 39:51.167
What do you want us to do?

39:51.250 --> 39:54.625
Get us into the ambassadorial
wing and off the station

39:54.708 --> 39:56.667
undetected after we've finished.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.208
- No problem.
- Good.

40:03.625 --> 40:06.333
Then there's just
one more thing..

40:07.542 --> 40:10.750
I call it a little loyalty test.

40:10.833 --> 40:11.917
[clicks fingers]

40:15.375 --> 40:16.542
Commander, please!

40:16.625 --> 40:17.958
- I don't know what these men--
- Shut up!

40:18.042 --> 40:19.125
[groaning]

40:21.792 --> 40:22.875
[whirring]

40:24.417 --> 40:26.583
- Kill it.
- No, please.

40:26.667 --> 40:28.958
- No! Please!
- Come on, Jeff.

40:29.042 --> 40:32.833
(Malcolm)
'You said it yourself. The only
good alien is a dead one!'

40:32.917 --> 40:37.792
Have mercy on me, commander,
please. No!

40:37.875 --> 40:38.833
(Alvarez)
'Malcolm.'

40:38.917 --> 40:40.500
[scanner beeping]

40:40.583 --> 40:43.083
The scanner, it shows a whole
lot of people heading our way.

40:47.958 --> 40:49.042
Move it out! Jag it!

40:49.125 --> 40:50.583
Clear it!

40:50.667 --> 40:52.667
[zapping]

40:52.750 --> 40:54.000
[groaning]

40:54.083 --> 40:57.083
[zapping]

41:01.625 --> 41:04.333
[groaning]

41:04.417 --> 41:07.458
[dramatic music]

41:11.667 --> 41:12.958
[whirring]

41:13.042 --> 41:15.792
I wouldn't. Give me an excuse
and you're dead.

41:15.875 --> 41:16.958
[door whirring]

41:30.458 --> 41:32.875
[sighs]

41:32.958 --> 41:36.000
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

41:39.292 --> 41:41.417
[instrumental music]

41:45.167 --> 41:48.042
(man on PA)
'Earth Alliance Special
Transport Normandy Beach'

41:48.125 --> 41:51.417
'is now departing from
Docking Bay-6A.'

41:51.500 --> 41:54.500
'All assigned personnel,
please report immediately.'

41:58.708 --> 42:00.292
Such great hatred

42:00.375 --> 42:03.250
for so little real reason.

42:03.333 --> 42:06.250
It seems incomprehensible to me.

42:06.333 --> 42:09.000
Human ways are often
unfathomable.

42:10.250 --> 42:12.750
But in time,
one learns to live with them.

42:12.833 --> 42:16.042
If one has an exceedingly
strong constitution.

42:19.667 --> 42:22.667
[indistinct chatter]

42:33.042 --> 42:36.292
(Malcolm)
I can't believe
you did this to me, Susan.

42:36.375 --> 42:40.625
What kind of a human are you
to side with them?

42:40.708 --> 42:42.708
(Susan)
'I find many of these people
to be more human'

42:42.792 --> 42:44.833
than you and your kind.

42:44.917 --> 42:46.792
But I don't suppose
you'd understand that.

42:46.875 --> 42:50.250
- I don't know you anymore.
- I never knew you.

42:50.333 --> 42:51.458
[door whirring]

43:05.750 --> 43:08.000
[theme music]
