WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:03.402
Falcon:
I'm on the scene,
slowpokes.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.337
Target looks big.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.006
Going in for a closer look,
avengers.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.009
Get here, now!

00:14.214 --> 00:15.748
The wrecking crew's
making their move.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.149
Everyone, follow me!

00:18.118 --> 00:20.019
Who made this
rookie in charge day?

00:22.188 --> 00:23.489
Wreck them, crew.

00:24.758 --> 00:24.757
These aren't your
average bank robbers.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.793
You'll get hurt
if you stay.
Let's go.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.061
(panting)

00:29.063 --> 00:30.162
(grunts)

00:32.499 --> 00:34.033
Come on, let's go.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.035
(grunts)

00:36.669 --> 00:39.071
I'm ready for you
this time, hulk.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.273
Yeah, ready
to get smashed.

00:43.810 --> 00:45.511
Daddy!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.814
(gasps)

00:50.583 --> 00:52.584
(strains)

00:52.586 --> 00:54.787
Don't know who you are,
but you're going down!

00:55.121 --> 00:56.221
(screams)

00:56.223 --> 00:57.423
Actually, he went up.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.091
(grunts)

01:04.197 --> 01:06.198
Those avengers
are amazing!

01:06.200 --> 01:08.167
Have you ever seen
anything like them?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.469
I'm one of them.
Falcon?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.304
Hmm?

01:12.539 --> 01:13.605
(sighs)

01:13.740 --> 01:14.807
Really?
(clears throat)

01:14.809 --> 01:17.076
Ah. Wait here.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.081
Impossible man:
Such star quality,
he's perfect.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.216
Widow, behind you!

01:24.218 --> 01:25.851
Falcon, in front of me!

01:26.820 --> 01:28.687
(both exclaiming)

01:30.723 --> 01:32.091
Impossible man:
Amazing!

01:32.093 --> 01:33.792
Hawk! Bolo on the low-low.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.628
Never say that again.
Stick to flying, kid.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.101
Nice one.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.778
All right!
Did we do that or what?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.380
(crowd cheers)

01:56.116 --> 01:57.382
Hello?

01:57.384 --> 01:58.851
(all cheering)

02:05.191 --> 02:07.292
Guess I'll go for
"or what."

02:07.627 --> 02:10.128
Being an avenger isn't
about recognition, sam.

02:10.395 --> 02:10.395
We do this work
because it's right.

02:10.396 --> 02:16.335
I... I get that, cap.
But could someone at least
know I am an avenger?

02:19.205 --> 02:22.141
Impossible man:
For once, someone does!

02:22.709 --> 02:23.876
Are you talking to me?

02:24.444 --> 02:25.911
Who else would
I be talking to?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.212
Those extras?

02:29.482 --> 02:31.517
That said,
there's always room
for improvement.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.686
I have notes.
Bow man, don't mumble!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.788
Gorilla verde, smile!
(growls)

02:37.390 --> 02:39.825
Can man, thunder bore,
two words! Background.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.827
Widow, perfect!
Now, give me less.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.463
This is all about
falcon, people.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.831
Take two.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.767
And action!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.803
Wrecking crew,
take two!

02:55.341 --> 02:56.508
Action?

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.957 --> 03:13.258
(growls)

03:13.260 --> 03:15.561
Are you crazy?
We just beat those guys.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.768
(grunts)

03:26.439 --> 03:27.506
(roars)

03:32.545 --> 03:34.279
Hey! Not your scene.

03:36.749 --> 03:37.916
(roars)

03:38.284 --> 03:39.484
(grunts)

03:40.320 --> 03:41.520
(yells)

03:42.655 --> 03:44.623
Where did this birdcage
come from?

03:44.625 --> 03:45.791
No idea.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.860
Oof.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.429
It's not going anywhere.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.697
Don't get overanxious.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.498
Wait for your
director's cue.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.702
Iron man, who or what
are we up against here?

04:02.842 --> 04:05.510
Iron man:
Hud pegs him as alien.
Potentially hostile.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.913
Code name,
impossible man.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.749
S.H.I.E.L.D. Threat
rating is a 10?

04:10.751 --> 04:14.319
Oh! A 10!
They like me,
they really like me!

04:19.892 --> 04:21.560
Avengers, assemble?

04:29.836 --> 04:30.969
(grunts)

04:34.974 --> 04:38.977
Let them go.
I can't handle wrecker,
dozer, and thunderball alone.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.881
You have to. I don't want
these background players
in your shot.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.024
(groans)

04:56.529 --> 04:57.929
I smell awards, falcon.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.431
Yours!

04:59.433 --> 05:00.999
What are you talking about?

05:01.001 --> 05:03.035
Come on, it's just one guy!

05:03.037 --> 05:04.036
Falcon: Yeah, why is that?

05:04.038 --> 05:05.337
Patience.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.572
I've seen
this pipsqueak before.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.707
Hard to smash.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.075
But not impossible.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.313
Huh?

05:14.315 --> 05:15.847
(groans)

05:16.349 --> 05:18.050
Let's wrap
this home movie.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.586
Hmph.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.893
(electricity crackles)

05:28.094 --> 05:29.361
Security!

05:29.363 --> 05:30.462
(yells)

05:32.432 --> 05:33.965
Ow!
Need a spotlight?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.567
Here!

05:37.103 --> 05:39.504
Please, no s'more,
please!

05:45.011 --> 05:46.345
Mmm!

05:47.814 --> 05:48.880
And action!

05:49.816 --> 05:51.383
Get me up there!

05:53.052 --> 05:54.753
Thor, end it!

05:56.456 --> 05:57.689
What wizardry?

05:58.991 --> 06:00.659
(grunts)

06:02.428 --> 06:03.962
Let falcon shine!

06:03.964 --> 06:05.597
There will be plenty
for the rest of you to do

06:05.599 --> 06:07.599
In the third act,
big alien invasion!

06:11.971 --> 06:13.538
Did he say invasion?

06:15.108 --> 06:15.107
(impossible man screams)

06:15.109 --> 06:18.009
Hulk's got impy.
Let's help falcon
with the...

06:18.411 --> 06:21.046
Wrecking crew wrapped.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.515
Yeah, I... I don't know
how I did it either.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.950
But impressive, falcon.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.153
Your alien friend
is right. Star quality.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.555
He's not my friend.
And thanks, tony,

06:30.557 --> 06:32.524
But I only wish
I could claim
it was all skills.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.160
You guys are the stars here.
I'm just background.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.728
(impossible man screaming)

06:42.034 --> 06:43.101
(blowing)

06:46.005 --> 06:47.105
(glass shatters)

06:47.107 --> 06:49.608
(gasps)
my camera!

06:49.842 --> 06:51.443
No!

06:53.112 --> 06:55.914
We need to get him away
from the public fast.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.082
Say no more.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.083
To the tower!

06:58.085 --> 06:59.184
(sighs)

06:59.685 --> 07:00.919
Impossible man:
Cut to...

07:02.155 --> 07:04.055
What is your mission
here on earth?

07:04.057 --> 07:04.055
I am filming the man

07:04.057 --> 07:08.026
Who will become
your planet's
greatest hero!

07:08.161 --> 07:09.661
And you chose
falcon?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.696
I did defeat
the wrecking crew.

07:11.698 --> 07:14.032
Somehow. Maybe
I could be great.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.868
You said an alien invasion
is heading for earth.

07:16.870 --> 07:17.969
These are more
of your kind?

07:17.971 --> 07:17.969
Ha! Don't be silly.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.807
There's no one else
like me in the whole
universe.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.508
The invasion
is a misdirect.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.544
He released the crew.
He's the threat.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.579
Not true! I just
can't reveal too much

07:27.581 --> 07:29.881
Because it'll wreck
the falcon story's
dramatic ending!

07:29.883 --> 07:33.785
Speak now or
I'll let hulk show you
a dramatic ending.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.887
(growls)

07:36.856 --> 07:39.224
Aw, teleporters!
I hate teleporters!

07:39.659 --> 07:41.226
Finding him now
will be impossible.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.962
<i>Did someone say impossible?</i>

07:43.964 --> 07:45.530
<i>Here, watch this</i>
<i>coming attraction</i>

07:45.532 --> 07:47.466
<i>That proves that I'm not</i>
<i>your biggest threat.</i>

07:48.901 --> 07:48.900
What?

07:48.902 --> 07:52.604
Announcer:  <i>In a world</i>
<i>filled brutish baddies,</i>

07:52.606 --> 07:56.208
<i>His desire to show red skull</i>
<i>that he can wash up</i>
<i>the avengers</i>

07:56.210 --> 07:59.544
<i>Is as deep</i>
<i>as the oceans themselves.</i>

07:59.546 --> 08:01.780
He wouldn't.
He would.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.649
Impossible man:
<i>Direct from his undersea</i>
<i>hotbed of discontent,</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:05.884
<i>Attuma!</i>

08:06.986 --> 08:07.986
(exclaims)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.654
What trickery?

08:09.789 --> 08:11.556
A foolish attempt
at capture.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.493
You won't get me
without a fight!

08:15.061 --> 08:16.094
(avengers screaming)

08:16.863 --> 08:19.197
Oh! Now, that's
a cliff-hanger!

08:22.602 --> 08:24.169
(avengers screaming)

08:24.604 --> 08:27.272
I have been waiting for this.

08:27.274 --> 08:31.109
The day I prove myself
worthy to red skull.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.245
Worthy of what?
Ridicule?

08:36.782 --> 08:40.217
Hey, bait for breath,
you forget the beating
we gave you last time?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.054
(strains)

08:43.222 --> 08:44.623
Why did you do this?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.558
I did it for you.
Go get him!

08:46.560 --> 08:47.659
You can take
this lightweight.

08:47.827 --> 08:48.894
(hulk grunts)

08:49.295 --> 08:49.294
You joking?

08:49.296 --> 08:53.064
Attuma is number four
on s.H.I.E.L.D.'s
most dangerous list.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.699
Hulk smashing him, maybe.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.001
Thor hammering him, maybe.

08:56.003 --> 08:56.001
But me?

08:56.003 --> 08:59.538
You're coming off
as too serious
in this piece.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.172
It should be
a fun battle romp.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.674
Let's go sitcom.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.178
I have a very bad
feeling about this.

09:07.613 --> 09:09.247
(yells)

09:11.083 --> 09:12.751
I knew you cared.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.286
(audience laughs)

09:14.288 --> 09:15.654
I do care...

09:15.656 --> 09:17.856
About my city,
about my planet.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.057
And you're not helping!

09:20.026 --> 09:21.259
(laugh track playing)

09:22.728 --> 09:24.763
What is this
maddening laughter?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.131
(laugh track playing)

09:34.106 --> 09:35.807
Iron man: Watch where
you're clobbering, thor.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.876
You just took out
our sensor dish,

09:38.010 --> 09:41.012
Which we kind of need
to track this space invasion.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.181
Ooh, don't worry, team.
They're still on their way.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.150
And man,
are they angry.

09:45.152 --> 09:45.150
(grunts)

09:47.086 --> 09:49.854
We must set aside
this minor threat of attuma.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.222
(yells)

09:51.224 --> 09:53.758
You find me a minor threat?

09:58.030 --> 09:59.698
(grunts)

09:59.932 --> 10:01.166
Aye.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.201
(laugh track playing)

10:03.636 --> 10:05.270
Get ready for
his entrance, people.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.673
(grunts)

10:08.675 --> 10:09.941
Attuma!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.343
Not attuma.

10:12.311 --> 10:17.282
Bring me avengers,
that I might smite them!

10:17.284 --> 10:18.817
I am an avenger!

10:19.051 --> 10:20.118
(laugh track playing)

10:20.620 --> 10:21.820
(grunts)

10:22.622 --> 10:24.189
I don't like tony's
new decorator.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.024
(laugh track playing)

10:26.359 --> 10:27.692
<i>That wasn't a joke.</i>

10:28.160 --> 10:30.095
Camera one.
<i>Try to reason with him.</i>

10:30.097 --> 10:31.663
Reason with him?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.632
He's impossible.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.367
<i>You're our best</i>
<i>hope now, sam.</i>
<i>And there's the theme.</i>

10:35.369 --> 10:37.168
<i>Find out if an invasion</i>
<i>is really coming.</i>

10:37.170 --> 10:37.168
<i>We'll handle attuma.</i>

10:37.170 --> 10:40.639
We're counting on you, falcon.
Monitors out.

10:40.940 --> 10:40.939
<i>Nothing on the hud.</i>
<i>Camera three.</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:44.142
<i>So imp is really</i>
<i>yanking our chain</i>
<i>or...</i>

10:44.144 --> 10:45.644
Or we're sitting ducks.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.680
(duck quacks)
(audience laughs)

10:53.319 --> 10:55.854
Don't let those scene hogs
push you out of the action

10:55.856 --> 10:57.255
And leave you with all
the talky parts!

10:57.257 --> 10:58.423
Get in there!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.358
This isn't making sense.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.193
Get me a script doctor!

11:02.195 --> 11:04.295
Bringing one of our
enemies into our home

11:04.297 --> 11:06.898
Is not funny.
Don't you get that?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.100
Yes. One enemy
equals not funny.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.969
I do understand.
Comedy comes in threes.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.303
Thus, more enemies
are needed.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.938
What? No!

11:16.175 --> 11:17.842
Impossible man:
Midgard serpent!

11:18.244 --> 11:21.012
Your movie is going
to destroy my whole city!

11:21.180 --> 11:24.416
No. It's giving you
the opportunity to save it.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.051
(roars)

11:27.319 --> 11:29.054
(straining)

11:29.321 --> 11:30.755
(grunts)

11:31.824 --> 11:33.391
Impossible man:
Ooh! This is money!

11:34.860 --> 11:36.261
(hisses)

11:37.129 --> 11:39.731
Hawkeye, imp is filling
the tower with villains.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.099
We're avengers.
We can handle it.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.834
We can handle anything.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.838
As soon as I grab
some more arrows.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.973
(growls)

11:48.975 --> 11:50.208
There's a wendigo
in my closet.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.210
(laugh track playing)
what's a wendigo?

11:52.945 --> 11:54.012
Oh, boy.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.014
(laugh track playing)
(growls)

11:57.149 --> 11:59.050
Correction, comedy
comes in fours.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.186
Maybe mores!
Maybe less.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.987
What are you
really doing here?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.857
I may have just found
my leading lady.
(growls playfully)

12:06.225 --> 12:09.327
I am not playing.
What are you doing?

12:10.863 --> 12:12.497
I just want to be known
as an artist, you know?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.132
Have people love what I do
as much as I love doing it

12:14.134 --> 12:15.934
And make falcon
a star, you know?

12:17.203 --> 12:18.236
But I'm not a star.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.171
Not in this or
any other galaxy.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.242
I know, that's why
I'm making you one.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.511
You got it wrong.
I'm backup.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.179
I'm the "save
the civilians" guy.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.315
The "reason
with the alien" guy.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.083
I can't handle
all this alone.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.086
It looks like
hawkeye is going to be
wendigo lunch.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.289
Now, that's
a catchphrase.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.325
(screams)

12:43.929 --> 12:46.431
No more comedy.
End this now!

12:46.899 --> 12:48.166
I'm serious.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.368
So am I!
Dead serious.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.237
Don't make me angry.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.872
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.440
What?

12:55.908 --> 12:58.243
Well, if my star is unhappy,
I'm unhappy.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.811
I'll scrub this scenario.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.513
(hisses)

13:01.515 --> 13:05.517
But, really, if you can't
take measly supervillains on,

13:05.519 --> 13:08.219
How will you stand a chance
against the alien invasion?

13:08.221 --> 13:10.455
You can't just
bring aliens here
for some stupid movie.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.091
Bring them?
I don't want them here.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.059
What do you think
I am? Bonkers?

13:15.194 --> 13:17.495
They're not coming to earth
to attack us, are they?

13:18.197 --> 13:19.464
It's you they're after.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.866
Ooh! Like you're so smart.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.902
Actually, I'm a genius.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.238
Bet you think you're rich
and handsome, too.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.542
How do you squeeze
that much ego
into such a small suit?

13:31.177 --> 13:33.311
Why do these alien
beings seek you?

13:33.979 --> 13:37.415
I was filming a documentary
about the most vicious race
in the galaxy

13:37.417 --> 13:40.318
When they noticed
and came after me in 3d!

13:40.820 --> 13:43.488
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't hand you
over to them.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.591
Even if they get me,
they'll ravage your planet.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.060
That's a pretty
good reason.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.930
Do you understand
how many people you put
at risk coming here?

13:52.231 --> 13:55.066
No. At first I thought
you were an underdog

13:55.068 --> 13:55.066
Who needed a little polish,

13:55.068 --> 13:59.571
But seeing you in person,
I believe in you, falcon.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.506
I really do.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.276
And there's our moment.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.413
Now, alien invasion,
like comedy,

14:08.415 --> 14:10.014
Is all about...

14:10.182 --> 14:11.282
Timing.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.053
And it's time
to go blockbuster!

14:22.461 --> 14:23.628
(aliens growling)

14:24.330 --> 14:26.231
Please tell me
that's not...
Chitauri.

14:26.565 --> 14:30.168
Warrior alien race,
conquer planets
for breakfast.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.504
And I'm guessing earth
is on the menu.

14:38.477 --> 14:40.345
(chitauri roaring)

14:43.282 --> 14:44.582
Glad I went
for the wide-screen.

14:44.584 --> 14:45.917
We're going to need it.

14:46.352 --> 14:48.553
Avengers, give me epic!

14:48.555 --> 14:50.421
Love to give you epic.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.358
If we weren't about
to be buried in chitauri.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.595
What? I can't hear you
over the incredibly
exciting musical score!

14:58.264 --> 15:00.865
Tony, you really
think I measure up
against these guys?

15:00.867 --> 15:03.001
Sure, but don't
try and go it alone.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.270
Teamwork, always.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.109
Action fest
tent-pole extravaganza,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.044
Take one and only!
Clack.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.113
Avengers, assemble!

15:19.218 --> 15:21.653
We may be a team,
but that's my line.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.022
Yeah.
Let's do this.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.661
Nice shot.
My turn.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.196
(growls)

16:01.126 --> 16:02.593
They're grouped tight
and just a few.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.096
More like a search party
than a full-on invasion.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.332
So far, but we
can't risk it.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.433
Go big.

16:12.705 --> 16:13.972
(grunts nervously)

16:18.043 --> 16:19.410
They seek the green one.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.046
Oh, good.
Oh, wait!
Uh-oh.

16:22.614 --> 16:23.614
(grunts)

16:24.750 --> 16:26.384
They just found him.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.690
(laughs)
I love these guys.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.992
But where's my leading man?

16:41.633 --> 16:44.435
Your chariot awaits.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.037
Perfect timing, falcon.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.472
Just like we trained for.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.606
That's why
it's called a team.

16:53.479 --> 16:53.478
Good news,

16:53.480 --> 16:57.248
About to drop the last
two advance scouts.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.655
The bad news,
the hunting party
is getting some backup.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.691
We need to shut
that portal down.

17:11.463 --> 17:12.630
(roars)

17:14.233 --> 17:15.800
Move it.
Hold it!

17:17.136 --> 17:18.603
Impossible man: Perfect!

17:20.739 --> 17:23.608
Go back home!

17:26.545 --> 17:29.547
Am I the only one
thinking that if they
did capture impy,

17:29.549 --> 17:31.416
He'd hurt them more
than he'd get hurt?

17:31.418 --> 17:34.152
You joke,
but you might be
onto something.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.653
You read me?
Loud and clear.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.259
Falcon, what are you doing?
I had you perfectly framed.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.560
You were amazing out there!

17:42.562 --> 17:46.431
Thanks, but we have
a story problem here
that only you can solve.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.233
I'm not a star.
I'm ensemble.
We all are.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.803
What? It can't be!
Then who?

17:52.204 --> 17:54.172
You.
Me?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.841
They won't stop coming
until they have you.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.645
But you have the power
to send them all
far, far away.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.281
Pop star quality.
You know what I mean?

18:03.549 --> 18:04.715
Hmm?

18:04.717 --> 18:09.720
I'm a fan of yours.
And I think this blockbuster
needs an impossible scene.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.422
Impossible man,

18:11.424 --> 18:16.127
I hereby deputize you
for one scene only
as an avenger.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.365
I accept.
I accept! I accept!

18:21.533 --> 18:23.367
Oh, there are so many
little people to thank.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.570
Hey, you can
handle this, right?

18:25.572 --> 18:27.672
Uh, falcon, is it?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.740
I'm an avenger.
We are avengers.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.110
Handling this
is what we do.

18:32.544 --> 18:35.313
What do you say?
Buddy flick?
Can you make the change?

18:35.481 --> 18:35.480
Of course I can.
I'm the director.

18:35.482 --> 18:40.284
But how will
the universe know you
if you aren't the star?

18:40.552 --> 18:42.587
Being a hero is not
about being known.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.621
It's about getting
the job done.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.258
And we're a team.
Me, them, and now you.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.660
You got a plan, sam,
now's the time!

18:51.363 --> 18:51.362
Third act twist,

18:51.364 --> 18:55.299
Impossible galactic strength
teleportation missile.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.368
And action!

18:58.871 --> 19:01.239
We get you to the rift.
You scatter the bad guys
across unknown dimensions

19:01.241 --> 19:02.673
And split just one
of your atoms

19:02.675 --> 19:05.510
While you shape-shift
to blow the rift closed.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.746
Save the universe, me?
I may weep.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.249
No one's ever asked me
to do anything (sniffles)

19:11.251 --> 19:13.184
Impossible before.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.823
Impy, it's now or never.
Can you do it?

19:19.258 --> 19:21.359
I never wanted to be
a box office bomb.

19:21.361 --> 19:21.359
But if my favorite
hero says so,

19:21.361 --> 19:25.530
An intergalactic missile
is the only thing
for me to be.

19:30.536 --> 19:31.769
Is that going to work?

19:32.204 --> 19:34.805
Cap, impossible
is his first name.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.508
You can count on me!
Storm the beach!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.744
Ten, nine, eight...

19:39.746 --> 19:42.847
Thor, we need
an express elevator
for the remaining chitauri.

19:44.616 --> 19:45.750
Done.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.522
Hulk, iron man,
jet assist.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.798
Will I really make
a good avenger?

20:00.933 --> 20:03.401
Pull this off,
I'm your number one fan.

20:04.636 --> 20:05.703
(grunts)

20:06.505 --> 20:07.738
Lift off!

20:10.542 --> 20:12.577
Our thanks, strange one.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.748
(chitauri screaming)

20:17.750 --> 20:20.451
You wanted me,
you got me!

20:20.453 --> 20:22.453
Ooh! That could be
my catchphrase.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.597
Fast thinking, falcon.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.365
You had the whole idea.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.968
Man, that's why I could
never be one of you guys.

20:37.603 --> 20:38.636
One of us guys?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.338
Avengers.

20:40.939 --> 20:42.940
Looks like
people are starting
to know your name.

20:43.609 --> 20:46.877
It's not about that, cap.
I get it now.
I totally get it.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.013
We don't know
impossible man's name,

20:49.414 --> 20:50.648
But he really
came through.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.516
A great sacrifice.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.518
I hope he was happy
with his finale.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.455
I'm sure he was ecstatic.
He blew up big.

20:57.756 --> 20:58.823
Can we go now?

20:59.825 --> 21:01.726
Forgot my camera.
Huh?

21:01.728 --> 21:03.694
I've got film festivals
to enter.

21:03.696 --> 21:04.695
What a tearjerker
this will be.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.530
It's got it all.
Laughs!

21:06.532 --> 21:07.932
Tears. Me!

21:09.201 --> 21:10.768
Falcon, I'll see you
when I finish the script
for the sequel.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.703
My people will
call your people.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.640
And my people will be ready.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.560
What is shawarma,
anyway?
