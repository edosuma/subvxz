WEBVTT

00:06.474 --> 00:09.410
- YEAH, DO YOU LIKE THAT?
- YEAH, I LIKE THAT.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.613
- WHAT DO YOU LIKE?
- I LIKE EVERYTHING.
I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.682
( panting )

00:14.782 --> 00:17.451
I KNEW WHEN I FOUND YOU
THAT YOU WANTED IT THIS WAY.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.220
FOUND ME WHERE?

00:19.320 --> 00:22.890
IN THE STREET,
WALKING ALONE.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.258
BUT WE DIDN'T MEET
IN THE STREET.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.461
WE MET AT A PARTY.
( moans )

00:27.561 --> 00:30.331
UH, MY GOD, ON THE STREET.
YEAH, THE STREET.

00:30.431 --> 00:33.401
- OH, YEAH.
- YOU WERE A JUNKIE
AND YOU WERE ONLY 11.

00:33.501 --> 00:39.173
- OKAY.
- AND YOU HAD YOUR FUCKIN'
CABBAGE PATCH LUNCHBOX.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.843
YEAH, AND I WAS REALLY
SCARED WHEN I SAW YOU.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.978
( both moaning )

00:45.079 --> 00:46.614
- OKAY, OKAY.
- FUCK.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.749
YOU'RE A DIRTY LITTLE WHORE
AND I'M GONNA SEND YOU HOME

00:48.849 --> 00:50.951
TO YOUR PARENTS
COVERED IN CUM.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.053
OH, DON'T DO THAT.
THEY'RE GONNA BE SO ANGRY.

00:53.154 --> 00:56.324
- OKAY. OKAY.
- FUCK. FUCK.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.326
- OKAY.
- WHERE DO YOU
WANT ME TO COME?

00:58.426 --> 01:00.294
- UH, WHERE--
- FUCK.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.296
- WHAT ARE THE CHOICES?
- FACE? TUMMY?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.331
- THOSE LITTLE TITS?
- OH, MY GOD. MY TITS--

01:04.432 --> 01:06.334
IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU WANNA COME ON MY TITS,
SO I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:06.434 --> 01:07.601
COME ON MY TITS
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO COME

01:07.701 --> 01:09.237
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.739
- TOUCH YOURSELF.
- OKAY. WHERE?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.807
- YOU KNOW WHERE.
TOUCH YOURSELF.
- OKAY.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.843
IT'S A LITTLE HARD
FROM THIS ANGLE.

01:15.943 --> 01:18.446
( panting )
FROM NOW ON,

01:18.546 --> 01:20.581
YOU HAVE TO ASK MY PERMISSION
WHENEVER YOU WANNA COME.

01:20.681 --> 01:23.284
IF YOU'RE TOUCHING
YOURSELF AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA COME,

01:23.384 --> 01:25.119
YOU'D BETTER
FUCKING CALL ME FIRST.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.721
- YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOU?
- ( slapping )

01:27.821 --> 01:29.490
OKAY.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.793
I'M GONNA MAKE
THE FUCKING CONTINENT
OF AFRICA ON YOUR ARM.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.562
FUCK!

01:34.662 --> 01:36.264
( moans )

01:36.364 --> 01:40.067
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
THAT WAS SO GOOD.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.503
I ALMOST CAME.

01:44.037 --> 01:47.040
YOU WANT A-- A GATORADE?

01:47.141 --> 01:50.511
WHAT KIND?
WHAT FLAVOR?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.246
ORANGE.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.684
UM... NO, THANKS.
I'M GOOD.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.187
( theme music playing )

02:05.393 --> 02:08.295
- OH, GOD.
- HOW DOES IT FEEL?

02:08.395 --> 02:11.332
- HOW DOES IT FEEL FOR YOU?
- IT FEELS GOOD, FINE.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.534
- IT'S GOOD.
- YEAH, IT DOES.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.438
OH, HEY, LOOK AT ME.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.241
- YEAH.
- LOOK AT ME.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.376
LET'S LOOK AT EACH OTHER
WHEN WE COME.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.545
- I'M GONNA TURN AROUND.
- HMM?

02:24.645 --> 02:28.148
- BUT-- BUT YOU HATE DOGGIE.
- NO, I DON'T.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.817
I JUST DON'T LIKE
DOING IT ALL THE TIME.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.386
NO, YOU SAID IT MAKES YOU
FEEL LIKE A PIGGY BANK.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.888
NO, I SAID IT MAKES ME
LOOK LIKE A PIGGY BANK.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.491
OKAY. YOU READY?

02:37.591 --> 02:39.427
I'M READY.

02:42.430 --> 02:47.000
F-UCKING JESUS,
THIS FEELS SO GOOD.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.136
OKAY, LET'S GO.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.606
OKAY, I GOTTA
GO SLOW.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.808
OH, MY GOD.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.578
OH, MY GOD.

02:57.678 --> 03:01.181
( music playing
over headphones )

03:04.017 --> 03:06.854
COULD YOU NOT
SMOKE INSIDE?

03:06.954 --> 03:09.823
OH. COULD YOU JUST--

03:09.923 --> 03:11.625
COULD YOU NOT
SMOKE INS--

03:11.725 --> 03:13.093
IT'S, LIKE,
I'M TOTALLY COOL, BUT--

03:13.193 --> 03:15.229
IT'S POT.
DO YOU WANT SOME?

03:15.329 --> 03:17.931
OH, NO, I'M HYPER
ENOUGH ALREADY.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.969
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.673
IT'S MY MANIFESTATION BOARD.
I USE IT FOR INSPIRATION.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.141
LIKE, WHEN I'M
NOT FEELING INSPIRED,
I JUST LOOK AT THE BOARD--

03:28.242 --> 03:31.178
- CAN I MAKE ONE?
- OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.481
YOU SHOULD
TOTALLY MAKE ONE.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.816
WE SHOULD MAKE ONE
TOGETHER.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.752
NO, I WANNA MAKE MY OWN.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.688
YEAH, MUCH BETTER IDEA.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.590
TOTES.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.360
YOU KNOW, JESSA, I'M--

03:46.460 --> 03:48.729
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
IS, LIKE, REALLY, REALLY HARD

03:48.829 --> 03:51.599
FOR ANY YOUNG WOMAN,
AND IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE

03:51.699 --> 03:53.467
THAT YOU WOULD WANNA
ESCAPE THROUGH DRUG USE,

03:53.567 --> 03:55.135
BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT JUST MY COUSIN,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.738
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.908
AND I COULD NOT
BE MORE PROUD OF YOU
FOR GETTING THIS ABORTION.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.747
THANKS, SHOSHANNA.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.251
Hannah:
OKAY, I THINK
I GOT EVERYTHING--

04:11.352 --> 04:15.155
TESTICLES, SPECTACLES,
WALLET, WATCH...

04:15.255 --> 04:17.425
Adam:
'KAY, BYE.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.860
DID I LEAVE ANYTHING
IN THERE WITH YOU?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.928
NO.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.065
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

04:25.165 --> 04:26.867
UM, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.069
I'M A DIRTY LITTLE WHORE
GOING HOME TO MY PARENTS
COVERED IN CUM,

04:29.169 --> 04:32.373
- YOUR CUM.
- WHAT?

04:32.473 --> 04:34.842
THAT WAS A JOKE ABOUT
THE THING YOU SAID LAST NIGHT
WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX,

04:34.942 --> 04:37.645
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE GONNA
SEND ME HOME TO MY PARENTS
COVERED IN CUM.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.851
I, UM-- I'M JUST GOING HOME
TO GET MY CELL PHONE CHARGER,

04:43.951 --> 04:46.920
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO A JOB INTERVIEW,
AND THEN, UM...

04:47.020 --> 04:49.056
I'M ACTUALLY ACCOMPANYING
A FRIEND TO HER ABORTION.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.091
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.260
SHIT.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.063
THAT'S KIND OF A HEAVY
FUCKING SITUATION.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.632
IS IT REALLY?
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE SAY
THAT IT'S A HUGE DEAL,

04:58.732 --> 05:00.668
BUT HOW BIG A DEAL
ARE THESE THINGS ACTUALLY?

05:00.768 --> 05:02.736
- I DON'T KNOW.
- RIGHT. YEAH,
IT'S JUST AN ABORTION.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.205
- THAT'S SILLY.
- NO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.674
I JUST MEAN,
WHAT WAS SHE GONNA DO,

05:06.774 --> 05:08.342
HAVE A BABY AND TAKE IT
TO HER BABYSITTING JOB?

05:08.442 --> 05:11.044
- IT'S NOT REALISTIC.
- NO SHIT, FUCKER.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.348
I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT THAT WAY,
BUT IT'S A GOOD POINT.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.949
I MEAN, I GUESS
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,

05:16.049 --> 05:18.251
BECAUSE THIS IS
THE FIRST ABORTION
I'VE EVER BEEN TO.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.521
NO, YOU DON'T SAY.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.056
I REALLY HOPE YOU DIDN'T
FIND THAT FLIPPANT,

05:23.156 --> 05:25.325
BECAUSE I DID NOT
MEAN THAT ABORTIONS
AREN'T A BIG DEAL.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.462
I JUST MEANT THAT I HAVE
VERY LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE
WHO DO NOT USE CONDOMS,

05:28.562 --> 05:30.531
BECAUSE THAT IS HOW YOU
GET PREGNANT AND THAT IS
HOW YOU GET DISEASES.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.800
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS ABOUT ME,

05:32.900 --> 05:35.002
BUT GIRLS NEVER ASK ME
TO USE CONDOMS.

05:35.102 --> 05:38.672
- GIRLS NEVER ASKED YOU
TO USE CONDOMS?
- NO.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.041
WHAT DO YOU DO?

05:42.876 --> 05:45.746
I DO WHAT I'M TOLD.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.315
( panting )

05:48.416 --> 05:51.385
- WE ALWAYS USE CONDOMS.
- DO WE?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.587
YEAH.
WE USED ONE LAST NIGHT.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.055
OH, YEAH, I GUESS WE DO.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.090
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
IT TAKES ME 25 YEARS TO NUT

05:57.190 --> 05:58.392
WHENEVER I HAVE SEX
WITH YOU.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.960
( laughing )

06:00.060 --> 06:02.596
HEY.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.533
OH, YOU'RE TOTALLY
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.234
YOU HAVE TOTAL
FREAK-OUT FACE.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.637
- I'M NOT
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.
- YES, YOU ARE.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.039
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT I LOOK LIKE
FREAKING OUT?

06:12.139 --> 06:15.042
- YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ME
FREAK OUT.
- IT'S OKAY.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.612
I'M TOTALLY FINE, OKAY?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.848
AND YOU'RE
TOTALLY PRETTY.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.584
- OKAY.
- STOP TRYING TO KISS ME.
STOP TRYING TO KISS ME.

06:23.684 --> 06:27.621
STOP TRYING TO KISS-- OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.531
IF YOU TELL ME
WHAT I AM DOING,

06:37.631 --> 06:40.033
THEN I WILL IMMEDIATELY
STOP DOING IT.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.635
THAT'S THE POINT--
YOU SHOULDN'T

06:41.735 --> 06:42.936
STOP DOING SOMETHING
JUST BECAUSE I TELL YOU TO.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.905
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO JUST BE YOURSELF.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.140
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
MYSELF IS MAKING YOU
VERY FRUSTRATED.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.742
WHO CARES, CHARLIE?

06:48.842 --> 06:50.410
YOU SHOULD JUST BE ABLE
TO GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS,

06:50.511 --> 06:52.480
PISS ME OFF,
AND NOT GIVE A FUCK.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.682
THAT'S WHAT MEN DO.

06:56.450 --> 06:59.487
IT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO M--

06:59.587 --> 07:01.455
MAKE LOVE
TO YOU ANYMORE.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.991
MAKE LOVE TO ME?
YOU MEAN, FUCK ME?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.160
IT'S LIKE YOU WANT ME TO BE
LIKE SOME DUDE WHO JUST
DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.362
LIKE, "OH, FUCKING SUCK IT,

07:09.463 --> 07:11.799
AND THEN FUCKING LAY DOWN
AND TAKE A NAP."

07:11.899 --> 07:13.400
EW.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.436
"YOU WANT THESE FUCKING NUTS
IN YOUR MOUTH?"

07:16.537 --> 07:17.805
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO SUCK ON YOUR NUTS.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.140
- OH, COME ON.
REALLY?
- NO.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.409
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR NUTS?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.277
- EW.
- LIKE, I KNOW
YOU'RE JOKING,

07:24.377 --> 07:26.146
BUT THAT'S NOT FUNNY
TO BE LIKE, "EW."

07:26.246 --> 07:28.549
- EW.
- ( door opens )

07:28.649 --> 07:31.485
( panting )
I NEVER GET USED
TO THOSE STAIRS.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.321
Charlie:
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.
HAVE A GREAT DAY, LADIES.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.856
OH, I MEAN, SLUTS.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.625
YOU'RE A SLUT.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.561
WHAT?

07:40.661 --> 07:43.631
- I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM.
- NO SWEAT OFF MY BACK.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.499
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- OH, MY GOD.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.135
I MEAN, HE'S SO BUSY
RESPECTING ME, YOU KNOW,

07:48.235 --> 07:49.637
THAT HE LOOKS
RIGHT PAST ME

07:49.737 --> 07:52.172
AND EVERYTHING
THAT I NEED FROM HIM.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.041
OKAY, YOU ARE
A 23-YEAR-OLD GIRL

07:54.141 --> 07:55.475
WHO'S HAD
THE SAME BOYFRIEND
FOR FOUR YEARS,

07:55.576 --> 07:57.244
SO YOU'RE ALSO
ALLOWED TO BE BORED.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.812
THAT'S AN OKAY EXCUSE, TOO.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.515
THAT IS A REALLY
SIMPLISTIC EXPLANATION
FOR WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.450
I'M SORRY
IF I MINIMIZED IT.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.852
I'M JUST UNWILLING
TO ACCEPT THE IDEA

08:04.952 --> 08:07.054
THAT YOU HAVE
TOO GREAT A BOYFRIEND.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.022
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU WANT
SOMEONE TO FEED YOU
ABUSIVE RHETORIC,

08:09.122 --> 08:10.858
JUST SEND HIM
TO ADAM'S HOUSE
FOR THE NIGHT.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.161
- HE'LL LEARN A LOT.
- OH, MORE HOOKER STUFF?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.462
HOOKER STUFF, DADDY ST--

08:15.563 --> 08:17.998
A COMBIN--
A PLATTER OF STUFF.

08:18.098 --> 08:22.069
HANNAH, ADAM CANNOT
DO THAT TO YOU.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.573
HE CAN'T. HE'S NOT ALLOWED.
HE'S NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.277
( keyboard clicking )

09:05.579 --> 09:07.480
( phone rings )

09:07.581 --> 09:09.950
HELLO, KWARTLER GALLERY.
THIS IS MARNIE SPEAKING.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.052
- Hannah: Hi.
- HEY. 'SUP?

09:12.152 --> 09:14.622
OH, NOTHING.
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST
WONDERING IF MAYBE--

09:14.722 --> 09:17.691
NO BIG DEAL, BUT YOU
COULD GET ME AN APPOINTMENT
FOR THIS AFTERNOON, TOO?

09:17.791 --> 09:20.427
- WHY?
- Oh, you know,
for an STD test.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.362
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE GONNA
BE THERE ANYWAY.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.665
AND IT'S LIKE,
I'M GONNA BE THERE,
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.767
MAYBE WE BOTH GET THEM.
MAYBE WE ALL GET THEM.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.569
NO. THANK YOU, THOUGH.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.171
WELL, WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU DID THAT?

09:31.271 --> 09:34.007
WELL, CHARLIE'S
BEEN TESTED TWICE SINCE
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER,

09:34.107 --> 09:35.976
- SO I FIGURE THAT'S--
- NOT THE SAME THING.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.211
I'VE ONLY HAD SEX
WITH TWO AND A HALF MEN,

09:38.311 --> 09:40.580
AND I'M GONNA START DOING IT
EVERY FEW MONTHS, I THINK,
JUST TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.015
You were
just bragging to me

09:42.115 --> 09:44.351
ABOUT HOW YOU
ALWAYS USE CONDOMS.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.520
JULIAN, STOP LISTENING.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.222
I MEAN, IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN DON'T YOU THINK

09:49.322 --> 09:51.258
YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.794
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STUFF
THAT GETS UP AROUND THE SIDES
OF CONDOMS, OKAY?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.763
WHAT ABOUT THAT STUFF?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT STUFF?

09:55.863 --> 09:59.066
OKAY, CRAZY ONE,
I'LL SCHEDULE YOU
AN APPOINTMENT.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.541
SO THIS GUY'S
MAKING YOU BANANAS?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.510
I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.246
THE THING IS I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE OF HOW
HE REALLY FEELS ABOUT ME

10:13.346 --> 10:14.648
BECAUSE WHEN
WE ARE TOGETHER,

10:14.748 --> 10:17.317
HE'S SO THERE
AND HE'S SO PRESENT.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.386
AND THEN HE DISAPPEARS
FOR TWO WEEKS

10:19.486 --> 10:20.721
AND DOESN'T ANSWER
ANY TEXT MESSAGES,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.522
AND I FEEL AS THOUGH
I INVENTED HIM.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.524
DID YOU INVENT HIM?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.828
IF I'D INVENTED HIM,
THEN I WOULDN'T HAVE
A GIANT BRUISE ON MY ASS.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.096
PAUSE.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.965
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO CONTRIBUTE HERE.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.804
"LISTEN, LADIES:

10:36.904 --> 10:38.972
A TOUGH LOVE APPROACH
TO THE TOUGH GAME OF LOVE."

10:39.072 --> 10:42.009
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY, I'M GONNA ADMIT THAT
I HAVE HATE-READ THAT BOOK.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.443
OH, MY GOD!

10:43.543 --> 10:45.612
IT, LIKE, TOTALLY CHANGES
YOUR PERSPECTIVE, RIGHT?

10:45.713 --> 10:48.615
OKAY, "IF A MAN DOESN'T
TAKE YOU ON A DATE,

10:48.716 --> 10:51.084
HE'S NOT INTERESTED,
POINT-BLANK.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.353
'LET'S MEET UP WITH FRIENDS'
IS NOT A DATE,

10:53.453 --> 10:57.057
IT'S A DATE FOR HIM TO DECIDE
WHETHER YOU'RE TRULY
GOOD ENOUGH TO DATE,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.859
AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE,
LADIES."

10:58.959 --> 11:00.593
THERE HAVE TO BE
EXCEPTIONS TO THAT RULE.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.831
"SEX FROM BEHIND
IS DEGRADING,
POINT-BLANK.

11:03.931 --> 11:07.167
YOU DESERVE SOMEONE
WHO WANTS TO LOOK IN YOUR
BEAUTIFUL FACE, LADIES."

11:07.267 --> 11:09.536
WHAT IF I WANT TO FOCUS
ON SOMETHING ELSE?

11:09.636 --> 11:12.639
WHAT IF I WANT TO FEEL
LIKE I HAVE UDDERS?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.742
THIS WOMAN DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

11:14.842 --> 11:19.379
BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION:
WHO ARE "THE LADIES"?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.481
OBVI-- WE'RE THE LADIES.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.383
I'M NOT THE LADIES.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.719
YEAH,
YOU'RE THE LADIES.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.055
I'M NOT THE LADIES.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.423
YES, YOU ARE.
YOU'RE THE LADIES.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.692
YOU'RE BEING UNFAIR.
YOU CAN'T FORCE ME
TO BE A LADY.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.361
I'M NOT FORCING YOU
TO BE A LADY.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.329
YOU JUST--
OKAY, I'M A LADY,

11:36.429 --> 11:38.565
SHE'S A LADY,
YOU'RE A LADY,

11:38.665 --> 11:40.868
WE'RE THE LADIES.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.702
FUCK THAT SILLY
LITTLE FUCKING BOOK.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.237
I TOLD YOU,
I JUST READ IT

11:44.337 --> 11:46.740
IN A WEIRD
MOMENT OF DESPERATION
AT THE DETROIT AIRPORT.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.842
HOW COULD YOU EVEN FINISH
A BOOK LIKE THAT?

11:48.942 --> 11:51.578
THAT BOOK IS SO IDIOTIC,
I COULDN'T EVEN READ IT
ON A TOILET.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.213
IT MIGHT BE
PINK AND CHEESY,

11:53.313 --> 11:54.948
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY
SOME VERY REAL WISDOM
IN THERE

11:55.048 --> 11:56.483
ABOUT HOW TO DEAL
WITH MEN AND--

11:56.583 --> 11:57.851
THAT WOMAN
IS A HORRIBLE LADY.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.887
WHY IS THIS
BOTHERING YOU SO MUCH?

11:59.987 --> 12:01.955
I'M OFFENDED BY
ALL THE SUPPOSED TOS.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.723
I DON'T LIKE WOMEN
TELLING OTHER WOMEN

12:03.824 --> 12:06.459
WHAT TO DO
OR HOW TO DO IT
OR WHEN TO DO IT.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.195
EVERY TIME I HAVE SEX,
IT'S MY CHOICE.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.998
- YEAH--
- AND IF I WANTED TO GO
ON SOME DATES, I WOULD.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.834
BUT I DON'T, BECAUSE
THEY'RE FOR LESBIANS.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.469
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:17.971 --> 12:20.040
- WHAT IS WRONG?
- ( sighs )

12:20.140 --> 12:23.043
I MEAN,
I KNOW WHAT IS WRONG,
BUT HOW IS IT WRONG?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.915
- ARE YOU SCARED?
- NO.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.785
- ARE YOU ANGRY?
- WHO WOULD I BE ANGRY AT?

12:31.885 --> 12:35.022
- MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE
ANGRY AT YOURSELF.
- NO!

12:35.122 --> 12:38.191
- SO ARE YOU ANGRY AT ME?
- YOU ARE SO SELF-INVOLVED.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.394
- ARE YOU SAD?
- I AM NOT A CHARACTER
FOR ONE OF YOUR NOVELS.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.596
STOP STARING
AT MY FACE SO HARD.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.399
FINE, OKAY.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.469
AND ALSO,
I WRITE ESSAYS.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.572
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.975
I REALLY WANNA
HAVE CHILDREN.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.944
YEAH, OF COURSE, YOU DO.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.847
AND YOU WILL HAVE CHILDREN
AT A TIME WHEN YOUR LIFE
IS ACTUALLY SET UP--

12:59.947 --> 13:03.851
I'M GONNA BE AMAZING AT IT.
I'M GONNA BE REALLY GOOD.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.718
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.620
I'VE NEVER DOUBTED THAT
FOR A SECOND.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.959
AND I WANNA HAVE CHILDREN
WITH MANY DIFFERENT MEN
OF DIFFERENT RACES.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.195
SO, I HAVE
THIS JOB INTERVIEW

13:15.295 --> 13:17.297
AND I'M GONNA
MEET YOU THERE AT 1:00.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.500
- I LOVE YOU, OKAY?
- THAT'S OKAY.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.280
- ( Hannah laughs )
- THIS-- YOU KNOW,

13:33.380 --> 13:35.115
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS
IT'S PRETTY BORING

13:35.215 --> 13:37.050
AND WE'RE JUST LIKE
A TRADE JOURNAL.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.887
NO. MY GOD, I MEAN,
I WOULD BE SO EXCITED
TO WORK HERE.

13:39.987 --> 13:43.523
AND I'M ALSO, I SHOULD SAY,
RESPONSIBLE, DECISIVE,

13:43.623 --> 13:46.927
AND ALL THE OTHER QUALITIES
YOU'RE WEIRDLY ALLOWED TO
NAME IN A JOB INTERVIEW.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.229
YEAH. I THINK
THE ONLY OTHER PLACE

13:49.329 --> 13:51.098
THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO BRAG LIKE THAT

13:51.198 --> 13:53.066
IS ON YOUR ONLINE
DATING PROFILE.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.835
- NOT THAT I HAVE ONE.
- OH, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.039
SO-- SO YOU LIVE
IN BROOKLYN?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.640
IS IT WILLIAMSBURG?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.675
- NO, I LIVE IN GREENPOINT.
- OH.

14:02.775 --> 14:04.511
- YOU KNOW, BIG DIFFERENCE,
WILLIAMSBURG AND GREENPOINT.
- OH, SURE, YEAH.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.114
- ARE YOU IN BROOKLYN OR...?
- YEAH, COBBLE HILL.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.116
OH, THAT'S LIKE
GROWN-UP BROOKLYN.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.451
YEAH, I'M LIKE
A REAL LIVE GROWN-UP.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.386
- CAN'T YOU TELL?
- ( laughs )

14:13.486 --> 14:16.256
SO, IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,
DO YOU EVER DRINK AT THAT
PLACE WEATHER UP?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.325
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT HIP
FOR MY TASTE.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.427
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE VERY HIP.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.296
BUT I DO OBJECT TO ANY BAR
THAT CALLS ITS BARTENDERS
"MIXOLOGISTS."

14:23.396 --> 14:25.265
- EXACTLY.
- AND THEY WEAR TINY VESTS.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.300
- I KNOW.
- IF I'M GONNA DRINK
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.069
- THEN I WANNA GO
TO WASHINGTON COMMONS.
- WASHINGTON COMMONS!

14:29.169 --> 14:31.038
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE THAT PLACE.
- HANDS DOWN.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.274
I LIKE A BAR WHERE
THE MEDIAN AGE IS ABOUT 55.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.410
I LIKE A BAR WHERE
THE AVERAGE PATRON WOULD
BE DESCRIBED AS "CROTCHETY."

14:37.510 --> 14:39.546
- CROTCHETY'S GOOD.
- CROTCHETY'S GREAT.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.015
- CROTCHETY'S UNDERVALUED.
- ( laughs ) IT'S TRUE.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.717
IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY,
CROTCHETY IS UNDERVALUED.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.487
SO, I SHOULD PROBABLY
LOOK AT YOUR RESUME
AS A FORMALITY.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.990
- I'M TOTALLY FINE
IF YOU DON'T, TOO.
- YEAH.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.159
AND SO--
YEAH, THIS IS GREAT.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.461
- THIS IS REALLY--
- WHERE DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

14:54.561 --> 14:56.629
OH, I JUST WENT-- I WENT
TO SYRACUSE, UPSTATE.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.166
- I HAVE SO MANY FRIENDS
WHO WENT THERE.
- YEAH, ME, TOO.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.667
BECAUSE YOU WENT
THERE WITH THEM.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.702
YEAH, A FEW OF THEM
UP THERE.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.837
I READ A STATISTIC
THAT SAID SYRACUSE

15:04.938 --> 15:07.740
HAS THE HIGHEST
INCIDENTS OF DATE RAPE
OF ANY UNIVERSITY.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.309
WOW.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.179
WHICH WEIRDLY
WENT WAY DOWN

15:12.279 --> 15:15.082
THE YEAR THAT
YOU GRADUATED.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.056
THAT WAS JUST A JOKE,
BECAUSE I WAS SAYING

15:23.156 --> 15:24.424
THAT THERE WAS
NO MORE DATE RAPE,

15:24.524 --> 15:26.826
BECAUSE THEY
FIGURED OUT WHO IT WAS

15:26.926 --> 15:29.362
WHO WAS DOING IT,
AND IT WAS YOU.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.702
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT USED TO
OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS LIKE THIS,

15:35.802 --> 15:40.407
BUT, UM, JOKES
ABOUT RAPE OR RACE

15:40.507 --> 15:43.143
OR INCEST OR ANY
OF THAT KIND OF STUFF,

15:43.243 --> 15:44.978
IT'S NOT OFFICE OKAY.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.747
AND SO, I JUST DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK OUT

15:47.847 --> 15:50.883
RIGHT NOW,
BUT CALL US BACK.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.153
MAYBE SIX MONTHS,
EIGHT MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD,

15:53.253 --> 15:55.588
AND WE'LL STAY IN TOUCH.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.726
( music playing )

16:05.798 --> 16:09.036
* I WANT TO SPEND MY LIFE

16:09.136 --> 16:11.104
* WITH A GIRL LIKE YOU

16:11.204 --> 16:14.307
* BA BA BA BA BA,
BA BA BA BA *

16:14.407 --> 16:17.977
* AND DO ALL THE THINGS

16:18.078 --> 16:19.379
* That you want me to

16:19.479 --> 16:23.216
* Ba ba ba ba ba,
ba ba ba ba *

16:23.316 --> 16:25.952
* Till that time
has come... *

16:26.053 --> 16:28.688
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

16:28.788 --> 16:31.458
WHAT TIME IS IT?

16:31.558 --> 16:34.161
IT'S 1:00.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.096
THESE THINGS
NEVER START ON TIME.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.266
- I'LL HAVE A WHITE
RUSSIAN, PLEASE.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.207
I AM REALLY SORRY, OKAY?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.042
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU ARE 10 MINUTES LATE.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.211
- I'M EIGHT MINUTES LATE.
- YOU'RE 10 MINUTES LATE.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.313
- OKAY, WELL, WHERE'S JESSA?
- WELL, SHE'S NOT HERE,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.082
BECAUSE SHE'S NEVER
FUCKING HERE WHEN
SHE NEEDS TO BE.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.617
- SORRY.
- WELL, SHE WAS
REALLY UPSET BEFORE.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.419
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT SENSITIVE.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.354
I MEAN, YOU THINK?
SHE'S ABOUT TO GET
AN ABORTION.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.424
IT'S ABOUT THE MOST
TRAUMATIC THING THAT CAN
EVER HAPPEN TO A WOMAN.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.925
I'M TELLING YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
BEING SO CASUAL ABOUT THIS.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.462
I WAS GETTING REALLY,
REALLY WORKED UP ON
THE TRAIN ON THE WAY HERE.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.964
YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT HER, OKAY?
THIS OFFICE IS BEAUTIFUL.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.301
- I'M SURE THEY'VE DONE THIS
A MILLION TIMES BEFORE.
- I WAS JUST THINKING--

17:15.402 --> 17:17.670
I HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY
IRRESPONSIBLE ENOUGH
IN MY LIFE THUS FAR

17:17.770 --> 17:20.373
THAT I SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN PREGNANT BY NOW,
AND I NEVER HAVE.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.474
LIKE, I GET MY PERIOD
AT THE SAME TIME,

17:22.575 --> 17:26.045
ON THE SAME DAY
OF EVERY MONTHLY CYCLE
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.614
LIKE, IT'S NEVER
STRAYED FROM THAT.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.582
THEN YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.584
I NEVER KNOW WHEN
I'M GONNA GET MY PERIOD,
AND IT'S ALWAYS A SURPRISE.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.087
AND THAT'S WHY
ALL MY UNDERWEAR ARE
COVERED IN WEIRD STAINS.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.556
SERIOUSLY, I NEED
TO BECOME A MOM, HANNAH.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.791
I WAS PUT ON THIS PLANET
TO BE A MOTHER.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.060
WELL, MAYBE CHARLIE HAS
A REALLY LOW SPERM COUNT.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.796
I'M SURE CHARLIE HAS
A REALLY LOW SPERM COUNT.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.432
WHAT IF I'M BARREN?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.934
- NO, YOU'RE NOT BARREN.
- Shoshanna: HI! HI!

17:48.034 --> 17:49.269
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.737
I STOPPED AT DYLAN'S
AND GOT SOME SNACKS

17:50.837 --> 17:52.339
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THESE THINGS TAKE.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.840
WHEN MY SISTER HAD A BABY,
IT WAS LIKE HOURS,

17:53.940 --> 17:56.643
AND I WAS LIKE STARVING,
SO, YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST--

17:58.211 --> 18:00.913
SHOSHANNA,
YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.649
SO YOU KNOW
VENICE IS SINKING.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.851
SO I'M LIKE, "WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.
WE GOTTA MOVE.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.954
THIS PLACE IS GOING DOWN.
IT'S HAPPENING FASTER
THAN YOU THINK."

18:08.054 --> 18:09.922
NOBODY FUCKING MOVES.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.291
I WAS LIKE,
"ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?"

18:11.391 --> 18:12.992
HEY, DO YOU GUYS
HAVE A PAY PHONE?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.061
WHY WOULD WE HAVE
A PAY PHONE?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.797
HERE, YOU CAN USE
MY CELLULAR PHONE.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.600
OH, THANK YOU.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.836
- YOU HAVE A BUNCH
OF TEXTS AND STUFF.
- MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.045
HEY, MOM, IT'S MORGAN.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.414
JUST CALLING
TO LET YOU KNOW

18:34.514 --> 18:36.883
I WILL CALL YOU BACK
IN A FEW HOURS

18:36.983 --> 18:39.919
AND I HOPE YOU'RE
FEELING BETTER.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.455
LOVE YOU. BYE.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.226
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.362
WHAT'S THAT
YOU'RE DRINKING?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.598
MILK.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.602
JESSA, IT'S MARNIE.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.970
IT IS 1:30, AND YOUR
APPOINTMENT WAS AT 1:00.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.308
SO CALL ME, PLEASE.
BYE.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.277
HEY, A LITTLE BIRD
TOLD ME

19:04.377 --> 19:07.547
THAT YOU WERE GETTING
AN S.T.D. TEST. FUN!

19:07.647 --> 19:11.184
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF FUN?

19:11.284 --> 19:13.753
I MEAN, LIKE,
JUST TO GET TO HAVE SEX

19:13.853 --> 19:15.788
AND THEN HAVE
A TEST ABOUT IT?

19:15.888 --> 19:18.691
THIS THING ASKS YOU
IF YOU WEAR A SEAT BELT
AND IF YOU OPERATE MACHINERY.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.860
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.296
YOU NEED TO WEAR A SEAT BELT
AND STOP OPERATING MACHINERY.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.131
SHE'S OBSESSED
WITH GETTING AIDS.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.267
SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS
GONNA HAVE IT SINCE
SHE WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.535
SO THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.437
I DON'T HAVE AN OBSESSIVE
FEAR OF AIDS.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.904
I HAVE AN OBSESSIVE FEAR
OF H.I.V. THAT TURNS
INTO AIDS.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.341
- I'M NOT A FOOL.
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE H.I.V.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.343
YOU JUST DON'T.
IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO CONTRACT.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.478
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT HARD
TO CONTRACT EITHER, THOUGH.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.647
- HAVEN'T YOU SEEN "RENT"?
- PLEASE, I'VE SEEN IT
12 TIMES.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.015
IT'S BASICALLY WHY
I MOVED TO NEW YORK.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.084
SO USE CONDOMS
IF YOU'RE SO SCARED.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.886
I DO USE CONDOMS.
I ALWAYS USE CONDOMS.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.922
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE STUFF THAT GETS UP
AROUND THE SIDES OF CONDOMS?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.391
WHAT ABOUT THAT STUFF?

19:51.491 --> 19:53.326
LIKE WHAT?
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

19:53.426 --> 19:57.597
OKAY, SO WHEN A GUY FINISHES,
THERE'S... THE MATERIAL, OKAY?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.166
- RIGHT.
- AND THEN, THAT STUFF

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
CAN LEAK OUT FROM AROUND
THE SIDES OF CONDOMS.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.135
AND HERE'S HOW I FIGURE IT.

20:03.236 --> 20:04.604
HE WILL LEAVE
HIS PENIS IN YOU

20:04.704 --> 20:06.473
FROM WHEN IT'S HARD
TO WHEN IT SHRINKS,

20:06.573 --> 20:08.275
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT GUYS
ARE WONT TO DO.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.744
ARE THEY REALLY
WONT TO DO THAT?

20:11.844 --> 20:14.381
YEAH, LIKE, WITH ME--
WITH ME THEY'RE TOTALLY
WONT TO DO THAT.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.815
YEAH, THEY USUALLY
DO THAT.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.918
AND THEN,
WHEN THEY PULL OUT,
IT'S FUCKING MAYHEM.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.120
I'VE BEEN DIAGRAMMING IT
IN MY HEAD ALL AFTERNOON.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.622
AND NO ONE SPEAKS
ABOUT THIS.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.759
- HANNAH HORVATH.
- OKAY, THAT IS ME.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.662
PLEASE, DON'T YELL
AT JESSA TOO MUCH WHEN
SHE GETS HERE, OKAY?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.798
I WON'T. I WON'T.
I MEAN, IT'S JUST--

20:31.898 --> 20:34.667
IT'S A BUMMER BECAUSE,
LIKE, SHE RUINED IT,
BUT IT'S NOT--

20:34.767 --> 20:37.169
HOW COULD SHE RUIN
THE BEAUTIFUL ABORTION
THAT YOU THREW?

20:37.270 --> 20:39.071
HANNAH, THAT IS NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.573
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD FRIEND,

20:40.673 --> 20:42.108
AND YOU THREW
A REALLY GOOD ABORTION.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.144
- OH, STOP IT.
- YOU DID.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.113
I'M JUST WORRIED,
YOU KNOW?

20:47.213 --> 20:50.617
WHAT IF SHE'S IN A GUTTER
OR CHANGED HER MIND?

20:50.717 --> 20:53.920
SHE SEEMED REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT IT THIS MORNING.

20:54.020 --> 20:58.090
WHOA. THIS IS WILD.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.559
PUT YOUR HANDS
DOWN MY PANTS.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.860
- NOW?
- YES.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.495
OKAY.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.631
- ( Jessa moans )
- LIKE THAT?

21:04.731 --> 21:07.033
- IS THAT OKAY?
- DON'T ASK ME THAT
EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.868
SORRY.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.371
UM...

21:11.471 --> 21:13.540
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.709
OH, MY GOD.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.279
OH, SHIT.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.915
JESS-STAR, IT'S SHOSH.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.452
IT'S-- IT'S LIKE 2:15,
AND I'M JUST CALLING TO SEE

21:25.552 --> 21:28.721
WHERE YOU ARE
AND HOW YOU'RE FEELING
AND, UM, IF YOU'RE-- OH.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.190
UH, HEY, YOU'RE PREGNANT
WHEN YOU DON'T WANNA BE,

21:31.290 --> 21:33.059
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA COME
HAVE YOUR ABORTION NOW.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.694
OKAY, THANKS.
BYE.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.597
THERE IS SERIOUSLY
NOTHING FLAKIER
IN THIS WORLD

21:37.697 --> 21:39.766
THAN NOT SHOWING UP
TO YOUR OWN ABORTION.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.268
I MEAN, HONESTLY,
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING
LESS RESPECTFUL THAN THAT,

21:42.369 --> 21:44.704
OTHER THAN GETTING PREGNANT
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.573
SERIOUSLY, SHE SHOULD
JUST FUCKING, YOU KNOW,

21:46.673 --> 21:48.808
RETURN OUR CALLS OR SOMETHING,
OR AT LEAST SEND US A TEXT.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.877
SHE DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW HOW TO TEXT.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.311
SHE CALLS IT
A "WORD ALERT."

21:52.412 --> 21:53.980
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHER ANYMORE.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.182
HONESTLY, EVERY TIME
I PUT MYSELF OUT THERE
WITH HER--

21:56.282 --> 21:57.484
NOTHING,
JUST BRICK WALL.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.752
SHE DOES NOT RESPECT
MY TIME, MY EFFORTS,

21:59.852 --> 22:02.221
MY FRIENDSHIP,
MY KINDNESS--
NONE OF IT.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.090
I MEAN,
WOULD YOU DO THIS?

22:04.190 --> 22:06.325
WOULD YOU GET PREGNANT
AFTER HAVING SEX WITH
SOME WEIRD FOREIGNER

22:06.426 --> 22:08.194
AND THEN JUST NOT EVEN
SHOW UP TO THE ABORTION?

22:08.294 --> 22:09.996
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.465
WHAT?

22:12.565 --> 22:16.235
I'VE NEVER
HAD SEX, OKAY?

22:16.335 --> 22:20.673
A.K.A., I'M ALMOST 22
AND I'M A VIRGIN.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.309
REALLY?

22:23.410 --> 22:25.512
- SERIOUSLY.
- OKAY.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.880
IT'S LIKE EVERYONE
AND THEIR MOTHER HAS
HAD SEX EXCEPT FOR ME.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.950
NO, SEX IS-- SEX IS
REALLY, REALLY OVERRATED.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.885
WHAT?

22:32.985 --> 22:34.487
IT IS.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.155
I MEAN, YOU'VE GIVEN
A BLOW JOB, RIGHT?

22:36.255 --> 22:38.925
- YES.
- YEAH, SO--

22:39.025 --> 22:40.226
- NO.
- REALLY?

22:40.326 --> 22:42.662
YES.
I HAVE NOT.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.331
- YOU HAVEN'T?
- THERE WAS THIS ONE
TIME AT CAMP,

22:45.432 --> 22:46.933
AND IT WAS A FEW STROKES
UP AND DOWN,

22:47.033 --> 22:50.970
BUT WE WERE IN THE WOODS
AND IT WAS KIND OF SPOOKY,
SO...

22:51.070 --> 22:52.872
YOU THINK I'M A LOSER.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.308
I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A LOSER.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.377
I JUST TOLD YOU
THAT I'M A VIRGIN.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.413
- I DON'T--
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

23:00.513 --> 23:04.150
I MEAN, I HIT-- I HIT
A PUPPY ONCE WITH MY CAR.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.419
I ONLY HAD
MY LEARNER'S PERMIT.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.728
- Doctor: 24 YEARS OLD?
- Hannah: MM-HMM.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.599
- Doctor: 145 POUNDS.
- OH, I'M 143 POUNDS.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.133
THE NURSE WEIGHED ME
WITH CLOTHES ON,

23:21.233 --> 23:24.036
SO THAT WAS
A RUDE THING TO DO.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.705
SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

23:25.805 --> 23:28.541
- JUST ONE PARTNER OR...?
- SHOULD I GET MORE?

23:28.641 --> 23:31.444
BECAUSE THE ONE I'VE GOT
IS KIND OF A HANDFUL.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.413
YEAH, IT'S JUST HIM.

23:34.514 --> 23:37.617
AND DO YOU USE
PROTECTION? CONDOMS?

23:37.717 --> 23:40.520
I ALWAYS USE CONDOMS,
BUT I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT LATELY

23:40.620 --> 23:42.722
ABOUT THE STUFF THAT GETS UP
AROUND THE SIDES OF CONDOMS.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.057
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH ALL OF THAT STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.394
YOU MEAN... THE SEMEN?

23:48.495 --> 23:49.762
I MEAN, ALL OF IT.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.831
I HAVE A VERY BAD
FEAR OF AIDS.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.533
HAVE YOU KNOWN
SOMEONE WITH AIDS?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.902
IT'S MORE OF LIKE
A "FORREST GUMP"-BASED FEAR.

23:56.002 --> 23:59.438
THAT'S WHAT
ROBIN WRIGHT PENN'S
CHARACTER DIED OF.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.475
OKAY, JUST LIE BACK
FOR ME, OKAY?

24:02.575 --> 24:04.310
YEAH. JUST...

24:04.410 --> 24:05.912
- YES, LEGS UP.
- MM-HMM.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.014
YEAH.
OH, OKAY.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.116
PERFECT, THANK YOU.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.954
THE THING IS THAT
THESE DAYS IF YOU ARE
DIAGNOSED WITH AIDS,

24:15.054 --> 24:16.823
YOU KNOW, IT'S ACTUALLY--
IT'S NOT A DEATH SENTENCE.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.660
THERE'S SO MANY GOOD DRUGS
AND PEOPLE LIVE A LONG TIME.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.731
ALSO, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAVE AIDS,

24:24.831 --> 24:26.899
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA
BOTHER YOU ABOUT,

24:26.999 --> 24:29.101
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
NO ONE'S GONNA CALL YOU
ON THE PHONE AND SAY,

24:29.201 --> 24:31.137
"DID YOU GET A JOB?"
OR "DID YOU PAY YOUR RENT?"

24:31.237 --> 24:32.572
OR "ARE YOU TAKING
AN HTML COURSE?"

24:32.672 --> 24:34.373
BECAUSE ALL THEY'RE
GONNA SAY IS, LIKE,

24:34.473 --> 24:38.044
"CONGRATULATIONS
ON NOT BEING DEAD."

24:38.144 --> 24:40.312
AND IT'S ALSO
A REALLY GOOD EXCUSE
TO BE MAD AT A GUY.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.314
IT'S NOT JUST
SOMETHING DUMB LIKE,
"YOU DIDN'T TEXT ME."

24:42.414 --> 24:43.616
IT'S LIKE,
"YOU GAVE ME AIDS,

24:43.716 --> 24:48.020
SO DEAL WITH THAT...
FOREVER."

24:48.120 --> 24:50.790
MAYBE I ACTUALLY
AM NOT SCARED OF AIDS.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.424
MAYBE I THOUGHT
I WAS SCARED OF AIDS,

24:52.525 --> 24:56.929
AND WHAT I REALLY AM
IS WANTING AIDS.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.337
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY
SILLY THING TO SAY.

25:05.437 --> 25:06.839
YOU DO NOT WANT AIDS.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.776
DO YOU KNOW THAT
EVERY 35 MINUTES

25:09.876 --> 25:12.144
A WOMAN IS NEWLY
DIAGNOSED WITH H.I.V.?

25:12.244 --> 25:15.615
AND A THIRD OF THOSE WOMEN
ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 30,

25:15.715 --> 25:18.384
AND MANY OF THEM
WILL DIE OF AIDS.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.086
SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT
IF ADAM GAVE ME AIDS,

25:20.186 --> 25:22.288
THAT I'M DEFINITELY
GOING TO DIE OF IT?

25:22.388 --> 25:24.356
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

25:24.456 --> 25:28.094
CAN YOU OPEN UP, PLEASE?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.497
YOU COULD NOT PAY ME ENOUGH
TO BE 24 AGAIN.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.667
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
PAYING ME AT ALL.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.572
- OW.
- IS THAT PAINFUL?

25:39.672 --> 25:42.208
YEAH, BUT ONLY IN THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.844
( music playing )

25:44.944 --> 25:48.681
* LOST CHECKLISTS,
SABOTAGE *

26:38.264 --> 26:43.135
