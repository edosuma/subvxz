<i>Previously on
New Blood...</i>

00:05.880 --> 00:07.674
<i>I think this is human skin.</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:09.342
<i>She bit her attacker.</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:11.428
<i>What if Iris was just the first?</i>

00:11.469 --> 00:13.513
<i>[Deb]</i> <i>He's drifting further
and further toward Kurt.</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:14.848
<i>What could possibly go wrong?</i>

00:14.889 --> 00:16.349
<i>I like you. I thought</i>

00:16.391 --> 00:18.268
<i>-you liked me, too.
- Last night,</i>

00:18.309 --> 00:19.269
<i>you broke that kid's elbow.</i>

00:19.310 --> 00:20.979
<i>Oh!</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:22.522
<i>Kurt Caldwell, you're
under arrest for the murder</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:24.190
<i>-of Iris Broussard.
- Who?</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:25.525
<i>Give this to your dad.</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:27.986
<i>-Stay away from my son.
- Titanium</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.029
<i>doesn't melt.</i>

00:29.070 --> 00:30.530
<i>He knows.</i>

00:30.572 --> 00:32.574
<i>Jim showed up
at just the right time,</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:34.034
<i>which is also weird.</i>

00:34.075 --> 00:35.577
<i>I would totally do a deep dive.</i>

00:35.618 --> 00:37.370
<i>But it's not like
he's hiding anything from you.</i>

00:37.412 --> 00:39.205
<i>I'm fucked up,
and I always have been.</i>

00:39.247 --> 00:40.749
<i>I remember everything.</i>

00:40.790 --> 00:43.001
<i>Daddy will be home soon.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:46.212
<i>And I think about it
all the time, hurting people.</i>

00:46.254 --> 00:48.381
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>The stab wound
doesn't match the story</i>

00:48.423 --> 00:50.091
<i>he told Angela.
Something's off.</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:53.178
<i>This wound wasn't made
by a hunting knife.</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:55.889
<i>Harrison brought his own weapon
to school that day.</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:58.391
<i>He has my Dark Passenger.</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:00.894
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

01:00.935 --> 01:02.979
<i>-Hey, psycho!
- That's enough.</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:04.981
<i>I have to tell Harrison
everything.</i>

01:12.572 --> 01:16.034
<i>On a hill far away</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:19.370
<i>Stood an old rugged cross</i>

01:19.412 --> 01:21.372
<i>The emblem</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:25.502
<i>Of suffering and shame</i>

01:26.711 --> 01:29.631
<i>And I love that old cross</i>

01:29.672 --> 01:31.633
<i>Hey, psycho!</i>

01:31.674 --> 01:33.593
<i>Where the dearest and best</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:35.720
<i>For a world</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:40.433
<i>Of lost sinners was slain</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:45.105
<i>And I'll cherish
the old rugged cross</i>

01:45.146 --> 01:47.774
<i>Cross</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:50.443
<i>Till my trophies</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:52.445
<i>At last I lay down...</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:56.950
<i>What you got now, ass wipe?</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:05.125
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:08.878
<i>Psycho.</i>

02:08.920 --> 02:12.423
<i>Fuck.</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:17.554
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

02:19.013 --> 02:20.640
<i>Holy shit, man!</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:23.059
<i>You fucking killed him!</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:24.811
<i>Ah! No!</i>

02:37.490 --> 02:41.119
<i>And I'll cherish
the old rugged cross</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:44.330
<i>Old rugged cross</i>

02:44.372 --> 02:46.332
<i>Till my trophies</i>

02:46.374 --> 02:50.837
<i>At last I lay down</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:53.173
<i>Yes, I will cling</i>

02:53.214 --> 02:58.178
<i>To the old rugged cross</i>

02:58.219 --> 03:00.180
<i>And exchange it</i>

03:00.221 --> 03:04.893
<i>Some day for a crown...</i>

03:15.320 --> 03:18.364
<i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

03:24.537 --> 03:26.706
<i>Afternoon, Mr. Caldwell.</i>

03:29.667 --> 03:32.212
<i>Hey, Elric,
could you turn the fucking</i>

03:32.253 --> 03:34.047
<i>hillbilly music down a little?</i>

03:34.088 --> 03:36.216
<i>Yeah. Sor-Sorry.</i>

03:36.257 --> 03:37.634
<i>The old ru...</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:40.887
<i>Everything okay?</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:42.722
<i>Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

03:42.764 --> 03:45.683
<i>Just checking in.
How's your job coming?</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:48.186
Oh, I got
your fish-and-game guy.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.355
<i>Oh, easy as pie.
You handling his son?</i>

03:50.396 --> 03:51.731
<i>My son?</i>

03:51.773 --> 03:53.191
<i>I'm handling everything.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:54.609
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:57.070
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:48.621
<i>up-tempo, dramatic music</i>

04:53.835 --> 04:57.046
<i>Fuck.</i>

05:03.594 --> 05:05.138
<i>Ah.</i>

05:12.979 --> 05:15.148
<i></i>

05:20.236 --> 05:22.322
<i>Fuck!</i>

05:50.391 --> 05:53.561
<i></i>

06:04.781 --> 06:07.367
<i>It almost fell, oh, my God.</i>

06:16.834 --> 06:18.795
<i>Hello?</i>

06:18.836 --> 06:22.548
<i>Hey, Harrison, I'm headed to
the Truck Stop. Are you there?</i>

06:22.590 --> 06:23.883
<i>I thought you were in jail.</i>

06:23.925 --> 06:25.134
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

06:25.176 --> 06:26.511
<i>That... We got that cleared up.</i>

06:26.552 --> 06:27.887
<i>That was just
a misunderstanding.</i>

06:27.929 --> 06:29.680
<i>Cool. Cool.</i>

06:29.722 --> 06:31.682
<i>Y-Yeah, actually, I, um...</i>

06:31.724 --> 06:34.310
<i>I-I'm not at the Truck Stop</i>

06:34.352 --> 06:36.145
<i>right now. I had to leave
a little early, uh,</i>

06:36.187 --> 06:38.231
<i>'cause my dad came by,
we had a huge fight.</i>

06:38.272 --> 06:40.566
<i>What do you mean, a huge fight?
You okay?</i>

06:40.608 --> 06:42.068
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:44.153
<i>Yeah, well,
it doesn't sound like it.</i>

06:44.195 --> 06:46.572
<i>Your dad just doesn't let up,
does he?</i>

06:47.532 --> 06:49.492
<i>Is he with you now?</i>

06:49.534 --> 06:52.537
<i>N-No, I, um...
I don't know where he is.</i>

06:52.578 --> 06:54.539
<i>Mm.</i>

06:54.580 --> 06:57.834
<i>Uh, well, did he call you
to check to see if you're okay?</i>

06:57.875 --> 07:00.253
<i>No.</i>

07:00.294 --> 07:04.632
<i>Okay. Well, I'm sure he's just,
uh, tied up with something.</i>

07:04.674 --> 07:08.052
<i>Hey, listen, buddy,
uh, where are you?</i>

07:08.094 --> 07:12.265
<i>Um, I'm a-across the street
from the-the Christmas tree lot.</i>

07:12.306 --> 07:14.308
<i>Okay, you stay right there,
all right?</i>

07:14.350 --> 07:17.019
<i>I'm gonna come and pick you up.</i>

07:17.061 --> 07:18.896
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

07:18.938 --> 07:20.606
<i>slow, ominous music</i>

07:41.669 --> 07:43.129
<i>I got to lose this guy,</i>

07:43.171 --> 07:45.965
<i>get back to his truck
and find my son.</i>

07:55.766 --> 07:58.269
<i>Hey. What's up?</i>

07:58.311 --> 07:59.812
<i>It's Christmas Eve is what's up.</i>

07:59.854 --> 08:01.647
<i>-Go home.</i>

08:01.689 --> 08:04.192
<i>Yeah. I'm...
I'm headed out soon.</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:07.361
<i>-You good?
- I will be.</i>

08:07.403 --> 08:09.822
<i>Well, you know,
if you ever, uh,</i>

08:09.864 --> 08:11.949
<i>want to grab a drink
or anything...</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:15.995
<i>...I'm sure that Jim would love
to hear from you.</i>

08:17.622 --> 08:19.290
<i>Did you hear that we-we had
drinks the other night?</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:20.666
<i>-I didn't.
- You know, he acts</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:22.752
<i>all easy breezy,
but underneath, he's...</i>

08:22.793 --> 08:24.295
<i>He cares a lot</i>

08:24.337 --> 08:26.839
<i>about you and Harrison.
I mean, look at how</i>

08:26.881 --> 08:28.508
<i>upset he got
after his kid almost OD'd.</i>

08:28.549 --> 08:30.384
<i>Nearly killed that drug dealer.</i>

08:30.426 --> 08:33.095
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

08:33.137 --> 08:35.473
<i>Uh, that's right.
You were, um...</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:39.810
<i>You were in New York.
Well, we went to Crystal Bar</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:42.522
<i>to arrest the drug dealer,
Miles O'Flynn.</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:44.941
<i>Jim had already found the guy</i>

08:44.982 --> 08:47.360
<i>and was, uh,
beating the shit out of him.</i>

08:47.401 --> 08:49.820
<i>-How did you not tell me this?
- Oh, I meant to. I just...</i>

08:49.862 --> 08:51.822
<i>Okay, look,
I didn't want it to look like</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:53.699
<i>I was talking shit
about your boyfriend.</i>

08:53.741 --> 08:55.952
<i>Uh, his anger got
the best of him.</i>

08:55.993 --> 08:58.955
<i>If-if it was my kid, I probably
would have reacted the same way.</i>

09:00.414 --> 09:02.583
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:04.585
<i>I-I-I wasn't trying to,
you know,</i>

09:04.627 --> 09:06.128
<i>make you upset or anything. I--</i>

09:06.170 --> 09:07.672
<i>Oh, it's okay. It's okay.</i>

09:07.713 --> 09:11.759
<i>It's... it's been a tough week.</i>

09:11.801 --> 09:13.761
<i>eerie, dramatic music</i>

09:34.156 --> 09:36.742
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>I really hate it
when I'm the one who's bleeding.</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:40.496
<i>slow, suspenseful music</i>

09:51.048 --> 09:53.759
<i>Your son's blood.</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:56.637
<i>It's all on your hands.</i>

09:58.472 --> 10:00.433
<i>Goddamn save him.</i>

10:00.474 --> 10:03.311
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

10:10.818 --> 10:14.614
<i>That's it. I guarantee
it'll make you feel dyno-mite.</i>

10:15.239 --> 10:18.868
<i>-Shit. No, I wasn't doing shit!
- Hey! Hey, hey!</i>

10:18.909 --> 10:20.286
<i>You've got some time to talk.</i>

10:20.328 --> 10:22.747
<i>Fucking bullshit! I was just</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:24.749
<i>-drinking a beer, man.
- Relax, Miles.</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:26.917
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you
or bust you.</i>

10:26.959 --> 10:28.961
<i>I'm here to ask you about your
encounter with Jim Lindsay.</i>

10:29.003 --> 10:30.463
<i>Who?</i>

10:30.504 --> 10:31.839
<i>He was the guy
who did that to your face.</i>

10:31.881 --> 10:35.092
<i>Oh. That guy. Fucking lunatic.</i>

10:35.134 --> 10:37.136
<i>Yeah. I'm still thinking
about pressing charges.</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:39.096
<i>Do you want
to tell me what went down?</i>

10:39.138 --> 10:42.433
<i>This isn't like a trick
or something, right?</i>

10:42.475 --> 10:43.851
<i>Like, you're not trying
to entrap me?</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:45.811
<i>Okay?
'Cause I'm not fucking stupid.</i>

10:45.853 --> 10:50.775
<i>No? Well, you help me out,
I'll return the favor.</i>

10:50.816 --> 10:53.027
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

10:53.069 --> 10:57.031
<i>So, I was at the bar,
having a drink,</i>

10:57.073 --> 11:00.034
<i>when that, uh, Jim dude,
or whatever his name is,</i>

11:00.076 --> 11:01.786
<i>comes over to me,
all friendly and shit.</i>

11:01.827 --> 11:05.122
<i>-Friendly?
- Yeah. He asks me</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:08.250
<i>if I could... do him a favor.</i>

11:08.292 --> 11:10.503
<i>Heard you might know
where to get some blues.</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:12.755
<i>Follow me outside.</i>

11:12.797 --> 11:14.799
<i>He asked you for drugs?</i>

11:14.840 --> 11:16.926
<i>Your words, not mine.</i>

11:16.967 --> 11:19.929
<i>Anyway, so he gets me outside
over by the dumpsters.</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:24.642
<i>So I could...</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:26.811
<i>So you could do him that favor?</i>

11:26.852 --> 11:29.647
<i>Right. Except out of nowhere,
he fucking jumped me.</i>

11:29.689 --> 11:32.233
<i>He just started attacking you
with no provocation?</i>

11:32.274 --> 11:34.318
<i>Yeah, just started
swinging at me.</i>

11:34.360 --> 11:36.320
<i>And look, okay,
this is gonna sound crazy,</i>

11:36.362 --> 11:38.406
<i>but before he started
pounding on me,</i>

11:38.447 --> 11:41.033
<i>he poked me in the neck, with,
like, a needle or some shit.</i>

11:42.576 --> 11:44.870
<i>-A needle?
- Yeah, and so, I was like,</i>

11:44.912 --> 11:47.206
<i>"What the fuck?" And I look up,
and I see the police rolling up,</i>

11:47.248 --> 11:49.417
<i>and I'm like,
what the actual fuck?</i>

11:49.458 --> 11:51.502
<i>And that's when he started
throwing fists, man.</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:55.047
<i>-Wait. Wait.
- He's got fast hands, yo.</i>

11:55.089 --> 11:57.508
<i>He starts punching you
after the cops show up?</i>

11:57.550 --> 12:00.261
<i>Yeah, man. Yeah, just right
as they rolled up.</i>

12:00.302 --> 12:02.012
<i>And the thing he poked you with,
you're sure it was a needle?</i>

12:02.054 --> 12:04.056
<i>Well, I-I didn't really
get a good look at it, okay?</i>

12:04.098 --> 12:06.058
<i>It all happened so fast,
but, like, I mean, look.</i>

12:06.100 --> 12:09.311
<i>I still got the fucking mark.
Check it.</i>

12:34.378 --> 12:36.338
<i>Kurt said I had
to bring you in alive.</i>

12:36.380 --> 12:38.424
<i>You know what?</i>

12:38.466 --> 12:41.761
<i></i>

12:41.802 --> 12:44.930
<i>He'll just have to understand.</i>

12:47.433 --> 12:49.310
<i></i>

12:50.436 --> 12:53.105
<i>Right?</i>

12:53.147 --> 12:56.776
<i>I mean, you know, shit.</i>

13:02.740 --> 13:07.077
<i>I think the school's closed for,
you know, Christmas break.</i>

13:07.119 --> 13:09.079
<i>Yeah, well, they haven't
changed the locks</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:12.875
<i>since I was Matt's wrestling
coach, so...</i>

13:12.917 --> 13:14.460
<i>What about security cameras?</i>

13:14.502 --> 13:16.712
<i>Oh, you mean
for our precious children?</i>

13:16.754 --> 13:20.132
<i>No, those are reserved
for tracking white deer</i>

13:20.174 --> 13:22.426
<i>because that's what's important, right?</i>

13:22.468 --> 13:24.637
<i>Sometimes it feels good to be bad.</i>

13:24.678 --> 13:28.641
<i>Don't you think?</i>

13:28.682 --> 13:30.309
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:34.480
<i>Besides, what are they gonna
do-- arrest me? Again?</i>

13:53.415 --> 13:55.000
<i>Fucking snow.</i>

13:55.042 --> 13:57.628
<i>Even a three-year-old
could track me.</i>

14:21.402 --> 14:23.529
<i>Come on, big man,
head on down that creek</i>

14:23.571 --> 14:25.865
<i>so I can get back to my son.</i>

14:31.245 --> 14:33.205
<i>First perfect game</i>

14:33.247 --> 14:35.374
<i>-in school history.
- That's Matt?</i>

14:35.416 --> 14:39.211
<i>Yeah. He was about your age.</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:41.630
<i>Ah, I used to go
to every one of his games.</i>

14:41.672 --> 14:44.550
<i>That's what I loved most
about being a dad.</i>

14:44.592 --> 14:49.179
<i>Whoa. He lettered
in three sports?</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:53.058
<i>Yeah. He was...</i>

14:53.100 --> 14:55.352
<i>he was special.</i>

14:55.394 --> 14:58.355
<i>Well, how's he doing?
Have you talked to him lately?</i>

14:58.397 --> 15:01.692
<i>Actually...
I haven't, you know.</i>

15:01.734 --> 15:03.819
<i>Uh, we never really
communicated very well.</i>

15:03.861 --> 15:05.613
<i>Not like you and me.</i>

15:05.654 --> 15:07.781
<i>Oh.</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:11.577
<i>Does that mean he's not
coming home for Christmas?</i>

15:11.619 --> 15:15.372
<i>Uh... you know,
with all the search party,</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:18.584
<i>I think he's afraid
to show his face around here.</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:21.420
<i>That's too bad.</i>

15:21.462 --> 15:22.838
<i>People are pretty forgiving.</i>

15:22.880 --> 15:25.299
<i>Especially during the holidays.</i>

15:26.717 --> 15:29.762
<i>Not everyone.</i>

15:29.803 --> 15:32.848
<i>Hey, let's go
have some fun, huh? Come on.</i>

15:44.485 --> 15:46.904
<i>Oldest trick
in the goddamn book.</i>

15:46.946 --> 15:48.781
<i>You want to play games?</i>

15:48.822 --> 15:51.450
<i>I can do this all fucking day.</i>

15:51.492 --> 15:54.495
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>You might have
all day, but I don't.</i>

16:01.710 --> 16:05.172
<i>-Shit. This is great.
Yeah. Right?</i>

16:05.214 --> 16:07.216
<i>Small towns love them
some sport, huh?</i>

16:09.051 --> 16:11.345
<i>I mean, what else
we gonna do, right?</i>

16:11.387 --> 16:13.639
<i>Okay.</i>

16:17.309 --> 16:18.978
<i>Uh, let's see...</i>

16:19.019 --> 16:20.729
<i>That one...</i>

16:20.771 --> 16:22.314
<i>All right.</i>

16:24.566 --> 16:27.319
<i>-Put that ball right in here.
- All right.</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:28.696
<i>All right, wait for me
to get down there.</i>

16:28.737 --> 16:30.614
<i>Okay.</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:38.580
<i>Okay.</i>

16:40.207 --> 16:41.375
<i>All right, anytime.</i>

16:54.054 --> 16:56.265
<i>Whoa!</i>

16:56.306 --> 16:58.934
<i>Wow. Matt's got nothing
on you, huh?</i>

16:58.976 --> 17:00.269
<i>Yeah, well, I led
the Mountain League</i>

17:00.310 --> 17:01.854
<i>in batting my senior year.</i>

17:01.895 --> 17:04.732
<i>Taught him everything...</i>

17:04.773 --> 17:06.942
<i>he knows.
All right, that's enough.</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:10.404
<i>Let's turn this thing off before
I hurt myself showing off.</i>

17:12.322 --> 17:14.783
<i>You ever play?</i>

17:14.825 --> 17:17.578
<i>-What, Jim never taught you?
- No.</i>

17:19.163 --> 17:21.832
<i>All right.
Let's see what you got.</i>

17:34.011 --> 17:36.638
<i>Summer camp.</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:38.557
<i>Perfect place for
a serial killer</i>

17:38.599 --> 17:40.309
<i>to make his stand.</i>

17:43.729 --> 17:45.731
<i>All right. Batter up!</i>

17:48.442 --> 17:49.818
<i>Sorry.</i>

17:49.860 --> 17:51.028
<i>It's okay, you don't have
to apologize.</i>

17:51.070 --> 17:53.447
<i>Okay. Here you go.</i>

17:54.907 --> 17:57.409
<i>It's all right.</i>

17:57.451 --> 17:59.411
<i>You just weren't taught right.</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:02.748
<i>Y-You're swinging with
your wrists, all right?</i>

18:02.790 --> 18:04.291
<i>Good instincts,
but you've got to use</i>

18:04.333 --> 18:05.709
<i>your whole body, right?</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:08.545
<i>You've got to step
with your legs.</i>

18:08.587 --> 18:10.589
<i>Swing. Whole body.</i>

18:10.631 --> 18:12.591
<i>There you go. Good.
One more time.</i>

18:12.633 --> 18:14.843
<i>Step. Whole body.</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:17.638
<i>All right, now, this time,
step, whole body,</i>

18:17.679 --> 18:19.348
<i>snap your wrists. Ready?</i>

18:19.389 --> 18:21.683
<i>Step, whole body, snap!</i>

18:21.725 --> 18:23.852
<i>There you go. There.</i>

18:23.894 --> 18:26.355
<i>You're not afraid,
are you?</i>

18:26.396 --> 18:28.482
<i>-No.
- Good.</i>

18:35.948 --> 18:37.783
<i>Now...</i>

18:39.284 --> 18:40.786
<i>Ready?</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:46.083
<i>Okay. Just... relax.</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:48.961
<i>Keep your head down.
Eye on the ball, all right?</i>

18:49.002 --> 18:51.213
<i>- gentle music</i>
<i>-Ready?</i>

18:53.465 --> 18:56.301
<i>Hey, attaboy!
Attaboy. All right.</i>

18:56.343 --> 18:59.221
<i>Good, good, good.
Now, step into it.</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:01.140
<i>Oh!</i>

19:01.181 --> 19:04.768
<i>There we go.</i>

19:04.810 --> 19:08.105
<i>-Whew! Good God!</i>

19:08.147 --> 19:10.149
<i>This is getting
too easy for you.</i>

19:10.190 --> 19:11.608
<i>You know what?
Let's try a curve ball.</i>

19:11.650 --> 19:13.735
<i>See how you handle that.</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:16.321
<i>All right. Here we go.</i>

19:26.123 --> 19:27.666
<i>You okay?</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:29.418
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:29.459 --> 19:31.420
<i>Yeah. I'm-I'm good.</i>

19:31.461 --> 19:33.672
<i>All right.</i>

19:48.770 --> 19:50.522
<i>Okay.</i>

19:52.149 --> 19:53.275
<i>Turn it back on.</i>

20:08.332 --> 20:10.417
<i>Sorry. I'm not the guy
you're looking for.</i>

20:14.004 --> 20:16.548
<i>Put another one in.</i>

20:26.600 --> 20:28.560
<i>And my own dad thinks I'm what?</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:30.938
<i>A liar? An animal?</i>

20:32.105 --> 20:34.566
<i>Again.</i>

20:37.319 --> 20:39.613
<i>Again.</i>

20:44.159 --> 20:45.535
<i>Again.</i>

20:48.330 --> 20:49.873
<i></i>

20:49.915 --> 20:51.833
<i>Again!</i>

21:12.729 --> 21:17.025
<i>You are one tough fucking kid.</i>

21:17.067 --> 21:19.778
<i>So, you ever had venison?</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:21.780
<i>No, I-- No, I've never had it.</i>

21:21.822 --> 21:24.950
<i>Really? You mean the whole time
you've been here in Iron Lake,</i>

21:24.992 --> 21:27.577
<i>Jim hasn't cooked you up
some venison?</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:29.288
<i>Nope.</i>

21:29.329 --> 21:32.165
<i>Oh. I don't know what the hell
he's waiting for.</i>

21:32.207 --> 21:35.794
<i>Come on, we're gonna rectify
that situation right now.</i>

21:35.836 --> 21:38.797
<i>All right. Let's go.</i>

21:38.839 --> 21:41.925
<i>I also see some</i>

21:41.967 --> 21:45.262
<i>quality Scotch
in your future.</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:16.126
<i>ominous music</i>

22:30.557 --> 22:32.601
<i>[Harrison]</i> <i>I thought we were
headed to your place.</i>

22:32.642 --> 22:35.520
<i>We are. I have a cabin
out this way.</i>

22:35.562 --> 22:37.022
<i>Oh, cool.</i>

22:37.064 --> 22:38.357
<i>Yeah. I do all my hunting
out here.</i>

22:38.398 --> 22:41.068
<i>It's where I keep my venison.</i>

22:41.109 --> 22:43.028
<i>It's nice, you know.
To have a place you can go</i>

22:43.070 --> 22:46.156
<i>to get away, be yourself.</i>

22:47.532 --> 22:48.992
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:54.247 --> 22:56.208
<i>dramatic music</i>

23:02.923 --> 23:05.884
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Hope he's as drawn
to blood as I am.</i>

23:31.368 --> 23:33.537
<i>You said you had all day.</i>

23:33.578 --> 23:35.080
<i>Well, I've got news for you.</i>

23:35.122 --> 23:37.749
<i>The night is mine.</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:46.091
What's going on?
Everything okay?

23:46.133 --> 23:48.385
<i>Yeah. It's just...</i>

23:48.427 --> 23:49.928
<i>You know what?
You were right.</i>

23:49.970 --> 23:51.638
<i>I pushed everything aside
to deal with Iris.</i>

23:51.680 --> 23:53.432
<i>I want to close out
all our files.</i>

23:53.473 --> 23:55.559
<i>-Now?
- Yeah, I keep thinking about</i>

23:55.600 --> 23:58.270
<i>that story you told me
about the opioid bust.</i>

23:58.311 --> 23:59.729
<i>You mind bringing me up to speed
on that case?</i>

23:59.771 --> 24:02.899
<i>Okay, um,
once we arrested Miles,</i>

24:02.941 --> 24:04.776
<i>I got him to snitch on
his supplier.</i>

24:04.818 --> 24:06.987
<i>Piece of shit
named Jasper Hodge.</i>

24:07.028 --> 24:09.281
<i>I coordinated with the Staties
to make the arrest,</i>

24:09.322 --> 24:11.950
<i>-but we got there too late.
- It was too late?</i>

24:11.992 --> 24:13.410
<i>Yeah. When we went
to make the arrest,</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:16.496
<i>he was already dead.</i>

24:16.538 --> 24:18.415
<i>Accidentally OD'd
on his own product</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:20.208
<i>while he was pressing pills.</i>

24:20.250 --> 24:21.710
<i>How long had he been dead
when you found him?</i>

24:21.751 --> 24:24.629
<i>About an hour before
we got there.</i>

24:24.671 --> 24:29.301
<i>So... maybe Miles
tipped Jasper off</i>

24:29.342 --> 24:30.927
<i>that the police were coming?</i>

24:30.969 --> 24:33.472
<i>Maybe he OD'd because
he didn't want to spend</i>

24:33.513 --> 24:35.807
<i>-all those years in prison?
- I don't think so.</i>

24:35.849 --> 24:37.726
<i>I mean, when I brought Miles
and Jim into the station,</i>

24:37.767 --> 24:39.561
<i>Miles gave up Jasper quick.</i>

24:39.603 --> 24:41.104
<i>But we held Miles for 24 hours,</i>

24:41.146 --> 24:43.023
<i>and Jasper was dead in ten.</i>

24:44.524 --> 24:46.318
<i>How long did you keep Jim
in custody?</i>

24:46.359 --> 24:48.153
<i>No more than an hour. I mean,
I wasn't trying to punish him.</i>

24:48.195 --> 24:49.738
<i>I just wanted to make sure
he cooled off.</i>

24:52.115 --> 24:54.117
<i>ominous music</i>

25:46.753 --> 25:50.382
<i>Stupid motherfucker took
a knife to a gun fight.</i>

25:53.593 --> 25:56.346
<i>All right.</i>

25:56.388 --> 25:58.890
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

26:23.248 --> 26:25.208
<i>intense music</i>

26:44.728 --> 26:46.938
<i>Christ! Who the hell are you?</i>

26:46.980 --> 26:48.690
<i>Where does Kurt have my son?</i>

26:48.732 --> 26:52.193
<i>Fuck you!
<i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i></i>

26:52.235 --> 26:55.614
<i>I think Kurt's got him
up in his cabin on Stern road.</i>

26:55.655 --> 26:58.450
<i>That's where I was to bring you.</i>

26:58.491 --> 27:00.952
<i>That's all I know.</i>

27:00.994 --> 27:04.414
<i>I was just doing my job.</i>

27:04.456 --> 27:06.791
<i>No-Nothing personal.</i>

27:11.796 --> 27:13.673
<i>We're talking about my son.</i>

27:13.715 --> 27:16.301
<i>There's nothing more personal
than that.</i>

28:21.574 --> 28:23.660
<i>Do you see this often?</i>

28:23.702 --> 28:25.745
<i>Fentanyl overdose?
Are you kidding?</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:27.831
<i>-By the guy making the pills.
- Eh, it happens.</i>

28:27.872 --> 28:31.126
<i>He had, um,
ketamine in his system, too.</i>

28:31.167 --> 28:32.669
<i>That could explain it.</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:34.754
<i>-Was it lethal drug interaction?
- No.</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:36.339
<i>A party drug.</i>

28:36.381 --> 28:38.049
<i>Probably took it to mellow out.</i>

28:38.091 --> 28:40.760
<i>-Made him sloppy.
- So, there's nothing to suggest</i>

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
<i>that Jasper's death was
anything other</i>

28:42.345 --> 28:44.097
<i>than an accidental overdose?</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:46.224
<i>Well, not unless
someone put a gun to his head</i>

28:46.266 --> 28:47.559
<i>and made him snort a line.</i>

28:47.600 --> 28:49.894
<i>Just want to check
one more thing.</i>

29:01.614 --> 29:04.117
<i>-Fucking faster, Dex!
- I'm going as fast as I can.</i>

29:04.159 --> 29:06.035
<i>-Text him. Warn him.
- It's risky.</i>

29:06.077 --> 29:08.747
<i>-You have to let him know.
- I don't want to tip off Kurt.</i>

29:10.248 --> 29:12.834
<i>This is the good stuff.</i>

29:12.876 --> 29:17.046
<i>This is what they call
single malt Scotch whisky.</i>

29:17.088 --> 29:20.550
<i>Best there is.
Only kind I drink.</i>

29:20.592 --> 29:23.219
<i>-Thank you.
- Go ahead. Give it a shot.</i>

29:26.389 --> 29:28.558
<i>-Hmm?</i>

29:29.893 --> 29:33.271
<i>Ooh. That kind of tastes
like a Band-Aid.</i>

29:40.612 --> 29:42.822
<i>You want to put
some ice on that?</i>

29:42.864 --> 29:44.574
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

29:44.616 --> 29:46.576
<i>Mm.</i>

29:49.829 --> 29:53.166
<i>Got to stop doing that
to yourself, kid.</i>

29:53.208 --> 29:54.876
<i>I mean, look, I get it.</i>

29:54.918 --> 29:57.295
<i>I-I used to do stuff like that
when I was your age.</i>

29:57.337 --> 29:58.880
<i>But the sooner you stop
punishing yourself</i>

29:58.922 --> 30:02.217
<i>for whatever you think
is wrong with you...</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:06.137
<i>Look, all I'm trying
to say is that</i>

30:06.179 --> 30:07.639
<i>you are who you are.</i>

30:07.680 --> 30:10.767
<i>Find what gives you joy,
and you do that thing.</i>

30:10.809 --> 30:12.727
<i>No apologies.</i>

30:12.769 --> 30:17.065
<i>Whatever it is that brings you
pleasure in this world.</i>

30:17.106 --> 30:20.610
<i>How do you...</i>

30:20.652 --> 30:22.487
<i>H-How do you do that?</i>

30:22.529 --> 30:25.114
<i>You just... take the leap.</i>

30:27.200 --> 30:31.162
<i>Well, I have
worked up quite an appetite.</i>

30:31.204 --> 30:32.330
<i>How about you?</i>

30:32.372 --> 30:34.541
<i>Starving.</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:51.641
<i>Whoo! This is gonna be tasty.</i>

31:01.484 --> 31:03.695
<i>Uh, hey, I'm-I'm getting
a little cold.</i>

31:03.736 --> 31:05.530
<i>Where's the firewood
for the stove?</i>

31:05.572 --> 31:08.658
<i>Um, it's around the side of
the house. I'll get it.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:09.951
<i>Oh, no, no, no. I got it.</i>

31:09.993 --> 31:13.538
<i>Come on, Harrison.
Come on. Come on.</i>

31:26.342 --> 31:27.969
<i>You good?</i>

31:28.011 --> 31:29.637
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:29.679 --> 31:31.890
<i>You know, if it's getting late
and you need to be home,</i>

31:31.931 --> 31:33.725
<i>I'm happy to give you a ride.</i>

31:33.766 --> 31:36.394
<i>No. No way.</i>

31:36.436 --> 31:38.104
<i>I wouldn't want to miss out
on all the venison.</i>

31:39.647 --> 31:42.233
<i>Yeah, it's smelling
pretty tasty in there.</i>

31:44.444 --> 31:45.695
<i>I'm glad we're doing this, kid.</i>

31:47.113 --> 31:48.907
<i>Me, too.</i>

31:48.948 --> 31:50.867
<i>All right. Hurry up.</i>

32:09.886 --> 32:12.013
<i>Shit.</i>

32:12.055 --> 32:15.183
<i>So I'm trying to make weight.</i>

32:15.224 --> 32:19.437
<i>And I-- you know. I start
wearing a-a garbage bag, right?</i>

32:19.479 --> 32:21.105
<i>-Mm-hmm.
- And then go for a run.</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:24.192
<i>I'm drenched in sweat,
I got terrible BO,</i>

32:24.233 --> 32:27.195
<i>and I'm wearing
a frigging Hefty bag.</i>

32:27.236 --> 32:28.696
<i>-Mm.
- I run around the corner,</i>

32:28.738 --> 32:30.740
<i>and there she is,</i>

32:30.782 --> 32:33.076
<i>-walking her dog.
- Oh, man.</i>

32:33.117 --> 32:35.787
<i>I had been gearing up</i>

32:35.828 --> 32:38.456
<i>to ask her to the Spring Dance
all week,</i>

32:38.498 --> 32:41.000
<i>but, you know, at school,
there's always people around,</i>

32:41.042 --> 32:43.628
<i>and I... I don't know.
I just kept pussying out.</i>

32:43.670 --> 32:44.963
<i>-I get it.
- So, this time,</i>

32:45.004 --> 32:46.422
<i>I say, "Okay, forget about it."</i>

32:46.464 --> 32:48.174
<i>I'm-I'm gonna take my shot.</i>

32:48.216 --> 32:50.134
<i>I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask her.
Right there, right then.</i>

32:50.176 --> 32:52.470
<i>What'd she say?</i>

32:52.512 --> 32:55.431
<i>Well, she looked me
up and down,</i>

32:55.473 --> 32:58.977
<i>like I had just escaped
from a mental ward, and said,</i>

32:59.018 --> 33:02.271
<i>"Do I look like I date
white trash?"</i>

33:06.025 --> 33:08.069
<i>Just laid me out.</i>

33:08.111 --> 33:10.363
<i>But you probably don't have
that problem.</i>

33:10.405 --> 33:13.783
<i>You're going out with the police
chief's daughter, right?</i>

33:13.825 --> 33:17.412
<i>Uh, I don't know.
After that last wrestling match,</i>

33:17.453 --> 33:20.456
<i>I-I think she looks at me like
I just escaped a mental ward.</i>

33:20.498 --> 33:23.626
<i>Well, you know, I guess some
people are just never</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:26.504
<i>gonna understand guys
like you and me.</i>

33:28.131 --> 33:29.924
<i>You know what I say?</i>

33:29.966 --> 33:31.843
<i>Fuck 'em.</i>

33:31.884 --> 33:33.928
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:33.970 --> 33:36.139
<i>-Fuck 'em!
- Fuck 'em!</i>

33:36.180 --> 33:38.891
<i>Attaboy.</i>

33:41.185 --> 33:42.353
<i>Ah.</i>

33:45.857 --> 33:50.361
<i>So... so-so what happened
with you going to jail?</i>

33:50.403 --> 33:52.905
<i>W-What was that about?</i>

33:52.947 --> 33:56.200
<i>Well, it was...</i>

33:56.242 --> 33:58.161
<i>just a little mix-up
with some DNA.</i>

33:58.202 --> 34:01.956
<i>Well, it turns out
that my dad</i>

34:01.998 --> 34:06.878
<i>murdered a teenage girl
in Iron Lake 25 years ago.</i>

34:06.919 --> 34:09.005
<i>-Oh, shit.
- Yeah.</i>

34:10.923 --> 34:13.926
<i>He was a really messed up guy.</i>

34:13.968 --> 34:17.805
<i>Wasn't easy growing up being
his son, I can tell you that.</i>

34:17.847 --> 34:20.224
<i>And I guess, you know,
since I spent the night</i>

34:20.266 --> 34:23.061
<i>in jail because of him,
it still isn't easy.</i>

34:24.103 --> 34:26.355
<i>Eh, you know.</i>

34:26.397 --> 34:28.983
<i>Sometimes a kid
just ends up suffering</i>

34:29.025 --> 34:32.904
<i>for the...
choices of his father.</i>

34:35.364 --> 34:38.576
<i>So, hey, why did the dad that</i>

34:38.618 --> 34:40.912
<i>abandoned you for ten years</i>

34:40.953 --> 34:45.541
<i>end up getting in a fight
with you at my truck stop?</i>

34:45.583 --> 34:48.586
<i>Oh, I-I don't even know
if it was a fight</i>

34:48.628 --> 34:50.922
<i>as much it was just me</i>

34:50.963 --> 34:53.549
<i>being pissed at him</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:55.927
<i>-all the time.
- Ah.</i>

34:55.968 --> 35:00.723
<i>I just feel like I keep wanting
something from him that...</i>

35:02.850 --> 35:06.145
<i>What? What do you want, kid?</i>

35:06.187 --> 35:08.356
<i>I don't know. I...</i>

35:08.397 --> 35:11.776
<i>When I came here,
I wanted answers.</i>

35:11.818 --> 35:14.028
<i>A-And now, as much as I...</i>

35:14.070 --> 35:17.782
<i>fucking hate to say it...</i>

35:17.824 --> 35:19.575
<i>I-I think I was also</i>

35:19.617 --> 35:23.788
<i>looking for, you know...</i>

35:24.413 --> 35:28.292
<i>Connection. Real connection
with your dad. Hmm?</i>

35:30.128 --> 35:31.629
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:35.258 --> 35:37.051
<i>But I-I think he knew.</i>

35:37.093 --> 35:38.219
<i>Even when I was five,</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:40.304
<i>I think, I think he knew</i>

35:40.346 --> 35:42.640
<i>how different we were.</i>

35:42.682 --> 35:45.977
<i>Yo, this is Harrison. Leave a
message and I'll hit you back.</i>

35:49.021 --> 35:51.649
<i>Well, w-we don't get
each other on, like,</i>

35:51.691 --> 35:56.237
<i>a-a normal,
father-son level.</i>

35:56.279 --> 36:00.783
<i>I-I feel like he's always
holding something back from me,</i>

36:00.825 --> 36:03.244
<i>or... I don't know.</i>

36:03.286 --> 36:06.831
<i>Whatever blood-bond most fathers
have with their kids,</i>

36:06.873 --> 36:10.001
it's-it's not there.

36:10.042 --> 36:13.546
<i>Listen to me. You cannot
blame yourself for that.</i>

36:13.588 --> 36:15.173
<i>That is on him.</i>

36:16.132 --> 36:17.675
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:17.717 --> 36:20.094
<i>Maybe it's his
childhood abandonment shit.</i>

36:20.136 --> 36:21.971
<i>Maybe it's mine.</i>

36:23.347 --> 36:26.184
<i>E-Either way,
I got my answer.</i>

36:31.731 --> 36:33.566
<i>If you were my son,</i>

36:33.608 --> 36:36.235
<i>I would never have
walked out on you.</i>

36:37.236 --> 36:38.905
<i>Ever.</i>

36:42.575 --> 36:45.703
<i>-Tha-Thank you for saying that.
- I mean it.</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:55.671
<i>-Ah, damn.
- What's up?</i>

36:55.713 --> 36:57.465
<i>Uh...</i>

36:57.506 --> 37:00.176
<i>Just something I have to
take care of.</i>

37:00.218 --> 37:02.386
<i>Okay. I'll be right back.</i>

37:25.034 --> 37:28.329
<i>intense music</i>

37:30.581 --> 37:33.042
<i>W-What are you doing?</i>

37:36.837 --> 37:38.506
<i>Wish it could've worked out
differently.</i>

37:38.547 --> 37:40.341
<i>But I don't have a choice, son.</i>

37:40.383 --> 37:42.593
<i>Sins of the father.</i>

37:42.635 --> 37:45.721
<i>It's a fucked-up world
out there.</i>

37:45.763 --> 37:47.848
<i>-I-I don't...
- Get up.</i>

37:50.226 --> 37:52.103
<i>Get out.</i>

37:55.314 --> 37:57.692
What-what-what,
did I say something wrong?

37:57.733 --> 38:00.444
<i>Did I do something?
I-I didn't mean to do anything.</i>

38:00.486 --> 38:02.655
<i>J-Just tell me what I did
and I'll make it right.</i>

38:02.697 --> 38:05.533
<i>I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.</i>

38:05.574 --> 38:08.619
<i>Please, Kurt.
Please don't hurt me.</i>

38:08.661 --> 38:10.788
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:12.873 --> 38:14.292
<i>Run.</i>

38:15.543 --> 38:17.295
<i>Run!</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:23.342
<i>Come on!
Get him out of the car!</i>

38:23.384 --> 38:26.220
<i>-I want him to see this.</i>

38:26.262 --> 38:28.055
<i>Come on!</i>

38:30.933 --> 38:33.019
<i>dramatic music</i>

38:33.060 --> 38:35.146
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

39:01.380 --> 39:03.299
<i>Harrison!</i>

39:04.675 --> 39:06.344
<i>gentle music</i>

39:16.395 --> 39:19.523
<i>-Are you okay?
- I'm-I'm not hurt.</i>

39:20.983 --> 39:22.902
<i>dramatic music</i>

39:25.821 --> 39:27.073
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

39:27.990 --> 39:30.868
<i>Come on.
Let's get out of here.</i>

39:35.498 --> 39:37.458
<i>contemplative music</i>

40:29.135 --> 40:30.719
<i>Ketamine...</i>

40:53.951 --> 40:56.287
<i>How did you know we were there?</i>

40:56.328 --> 40:58.664
<i>D-Did you know Kurt was...</i>

40:58.706 --> 41:01.333
<i>What's-what's going on?</i>

41:02.668 --> 41:04.295
<i>There's so much
I need to tell you.</i>

41:04.336 --> 41:08.090
<i>I should've way before
it got to this.</i>

41:08.132 --> 41:10.593
<i>You need to know.</i>

41:10.634 --> 41:13.596
<i>gentle music</i>

41:13.637 --> 41:14.763
<i>What?</i>

41:18.350 --> 41:20.102
<i>Before anything else,
you need to know</i>

41:20.144 --> 41:23.606
<i>that you never have to feel
alone with your dark...</i>

41:23.647 --> 41:26.192
<i>thoughts again.</i>

41:29.987 --> 41:31.655
<i>You were probably
drawn to Kurt because</i>

41:31.697 --> 41:34.700
<i>he seemed to understand you,
but I...</i>

41:36.911 --> 41:40.831
<i>...I was born in blood,
just like you.</i>

41:40.873 --> 41:44.335
<i>I had the same violent urges
when I was your age.</i>

41:44.376 --> 41:46.670
<i>Like you, I didn't know
how to deal with them.</i>

41:50.216 --> 41:53.844
<i>But my dad taught me a code.</i>

41:53.886 --> 41:56.222
<i>A way to channel those urges.</i>

41:57.515 --> 41:59.767
<i>I'm gonna tell you everything.</i>

42:06.398 --> 42:08.025
<i>This is all I had to do.</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:10.069
<i>This is all he ever wanted.</i>

42:16.158 --> 42:18.786
<i>Maybe, if I'm being honest...</i>

42:18.827 --> 42:21.914
<i>maybe this is all
I ever wanted, too.</i>
