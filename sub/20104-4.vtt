WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.904
I called earlier about a missing
U.S. citizen in the Middle East.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.173
How are you, Sara?

00:05.206 --> 00:07.575
I wanted the State
Department, not you.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.910
Any chance Poseidon will
just let us kill her?

00:09.943 --> 00:11.845
SARA:
I've learned some things

00:11.879 --> 00:13.881
about who it is we're
apparently both looking for.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.983
C-NOTE:
You think Michael's in Yemen?

00:16.015 --> 00:19.153
We're gonna get you out of here.
I don't know who you are.

00:19.187 --> 00:22.323
C-NOTE: Your brother was using
this shop for his escape.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.657
We're here for passports.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.693
(screams)

00:25.726 --> 00:26.927
(grunts)

00:26.960 --> 00:29.530
Figure we got a day
to get out of this hole.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.899
We're still getting out.
All of us.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.073
Poseidon put us in
here to get Ramal out,

00:39.107 --> 00:40.608
but then he abandoned us.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.875
Ramal's Poseidon's guy,

00:41.909 --> 00:43.677
not ours.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.946
Our friend told me
about the escape.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.548
He will betray you.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.283
MICHAEL:
When those lights go black,

00:49.317 --> 00:51.452
we're gonna disappear
from this place like ghosts.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.753
I can't get it open.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.555
Help me out.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.191
You pull my brother up first.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.226
(screams)

00:58.259 --> 01:00.094
(crying):
Mosa! Mosa!

01:02.430 --> 01:03.797
Don't shoot.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.110
Hey.
Hey.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.945
How you feeling?

01:17.978 --> 01:19.813
Body is fine.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.282
My head is

01:21.315 --> 01:23.617
trying to figure out
how to get those passports

01:23.651 --> 01:25.219
we couldn't get last night.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.055
For you, those kids.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.623
Well, that's something
you shouldn't

01:29.657 --> 01:31.091
be worrying about right now.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.760
You should rest up.
We're gonna need you.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.428
I can rest when I'm dead.

01:34.462 --> 01:38.098
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.068
Didn't know you worried.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.103
About the right things.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.208
Your brother.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.245
He make it out?

01:51.279 --> 01:53.647
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.085
Sheba, do you mind if I borrow
Linc for a second?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.488
Yeah.
Okay.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.723
Please get some rest.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.467
(indistinct speaking
over hospital PA)

02:13.501 --> 02:15.135
Listen. We got
to start talking

02:15.169 --> 02:16.604
about leaving the country.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.938
What are you talking about?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.374
I spoke to my friends
at the mosque.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.676
ISIL is taking
neighborhoods by the hour.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.545
If they cut off the
route to the airport...

02:24.578 --> 02:27.615
I'm not leaving Michael.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.484
If they cut off the airport,
no one is getting out.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.320
Not you, me, Sheba.

02:33.554 --> 02:37.325
As much as it
kills me to say...

02:37.358 --> 02:40.894
we can't risk
all of it for...

02:40.928 --> 02:42.062
just one man.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.733
You're right.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.734
You can leave.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.369
But I can't.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.505
Get that family to the airport
as fast as you can.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.806
I'll work something out.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.676
Mr. Burrows?

02:55.709 --> 02:58.479
I wanted to thank you
for saving my daughter.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.715
And offer you something
in appreciation.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.651
I might have a solution
for how to get your brother

03:03.684 --> 03:05.253
out of that prison.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.987
(explosion)

03:07.020 --> 03:10.023
Before the city goes to hell.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.898
(men shouting)

03:17.931 --> 03:18.932
You hear that?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.000
That was the closest one yet!

03:20.033 --> 03:21.602
100 yards!

03:21.635 --> 03:23.003
Just when you think
it couldn't get worse

03:23.036 --> 03:24.705
locked up in a Porta-Potty,

03:24.738 --> 03:28.376
they start dropping 2,000-pound
bombs on the Porta-Potty.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.911
MICHAEL:
Whip. Keep it together, please.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.951
The escape artist is nervous.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.420
MICHAEL:
You should be, too.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.356
Those artillery strikes,
they don't discriminate.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.525
The difference is I have faith.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.226
Allah will deliver me.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.961
What do you have?

03:47.995 --> 03:50.230
Ja!

03:50.264 --> 03:51.265
Ja, are you there?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.266
I'm here.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.368
(explosion)

03:54.402 --> 03:55.369
Whip's right.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.470
The strikes are

03:56.504 --> 03:57.538
getting closer.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.872
I pity you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.541
I triumph either way.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.744
Either I will be in paradise
or Allah will save me.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.145
You,

04:05.178 --> 04:07.381
you're just
going to die.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.750
(indistinct conversations)

04:11.952 --> 04:14.555
ISIL has broken through
the checkpoints.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.623
They're coming
into the city.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.923
These uniforms
are like targets

04:16.957 --> 04:19.392
on our backs.
ISIL isn't here yet.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.295
The government says
it will push them back.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.930
You out of your head?
This is happening.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.933
Sana'a is falling.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.971
They're going to retreat.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.106
I've seen that look before
in the army.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.443
Men who will do anything
to save themselves.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.678
And how do we
save ourselves?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.180
ISIL takes this prison, we'll be
the first they slaughter.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.849
When they take this prison,
it will be

04:41.882 --> 04:44.318
to liberate their leader, Ramal.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.019
But if, when they get here,

04:46.053 --> 04:47.988
we have him with a knife

04:48.021 --> 04:49.490
to his throat,

04:49.523 --> 04:51.158
then we call the shots.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.960
And we might just live.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.862
MICHAEL:
Whip, I got a Hail Mary.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.698
That a prayer or a plan?
Plan.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.266
I left something the last time
I was in here.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.968
Let me guess,
you got a contingency.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.170
They lock me away in a box
for four years.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.538
I'm not just gonna sit there.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.206
It's a long shot,
but it might get us out.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.875
ABU RAMAL:
The infidel still
tries to escape.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.010
The desperate rat.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.612
The desperate rat's
gonna light you up

05:11.645 --> 05:12.946
once we get out of here,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
you bugged-eyed freak.
MICHAEL:
Whip.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.217
Whip! An "S."
Is there an "S"

05:17.250 --> 05:18.486
carved in your wall
chest high

05:18.519 --> 05:20.020
in the corner?

05:21.221 --> 05:22.956
Come on, come on.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.224
That's not it.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.293
I'm not seeing anything.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.861
I'm not seeing it.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.463
Ja, it's got to be you.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.298
Come on. Tell me you got an "S"
carved in your wall.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.533
It's our last chance.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.867
No.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.836
It's not here, no.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.410
(laughing)

05:50.518 --> 05:53.220
(whispering): That's because
I have it in my cell.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.788
(explosion)

05:55.956 --> 05:58.559
My armies of the caliphate

05:58.592 --> 06:00.694
are coming closer.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.930
The moment they reach
this place,

06:02.963 --> 06:06.867
all of you will be put down
like the dogs that you are.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.971
*

06:40.968 --> 06:42.936
*

06:51.344 --> 06:53.146
T-BAG:
All right, Sara.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.083
Our friend Poseidon
has surfaced.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.755
(car engine starts
in the distance)

07:08.629 --> 07:10.097
JAMIL:
Good God.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.032
Another ISIL attack.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.103
They're ripping the city apart.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.438
They're animals.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.907
I've been a bureaucrat
my whole life.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.842
Hated it.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.343
Corruption, backslapping.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.245
But today, maybe some good
will come of it.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.681
I went to grammar school
with this boy

07:27.715 --> 07:29.517
named Ibrahim.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.919
All the years later,
he's a federal judge.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.688
You, uh, saying this
judge can help us?

07:34.722 --> 07:36.423
I called him a few hours ago
and told him

07:36.456 --> 07:37.691
about your brother's case.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.294
(gunshot in the distance)

07:41.328 --> 07:43.296
JAMIL:
Redecorating, I see.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.700
Just readying for
the coming change of seasons.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.470
Luxury is something
the Wahabbists frown upon,

07:50.504 --> 07:52.640
so luxury will stay
behind closed doors.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.508
You should flee the country.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.843
I'm a survivor, you know that.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
I thought Mr. Burrows
could perhaps

07:57.811 --> 07:59.312
help with
his brother's cause.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.049
Ah, yes.

08:02.082 --> 08:06.787
A full pardon from
the Supreme Judicial Council.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.289
But you will have to uphold
your end of the bargain,

08:09.322 --> 08:11.324
Jamil.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.864
German engineering.
77,000 miles.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.532
Five liter,
seven speed, V10.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.535
It will be a welcome
bit of luxury.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.638
Behind closed doors,
of course.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.074
Best of luck
to both of you.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.408
I really appreciate this.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.677
Thank you.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.812
It's already done.

08:31.845 --> 08:36.416
It would've been
left behind anyhow.

08:38.719 --> 08:39.919
May both of our families

08:39.953 --> 08:42.155
get safely out
of Sana'a tonight.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.191
(explosion)

08:44.224 --> 08:45.659
WHIP:
We can't just sit here and die.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.495
You-you got a window
like this one, right?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.097
Maybe we can pry it.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.732
It's too small, reinforced.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.901
Built into the
rebar infrastructure.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.268
You got people
on the outside, right?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.503
And they're gonna try
and get us out.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.771
They were supposed
to meet us at the shop

08:57.805 --> 08:59.172
last night and we didn't show.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.373
We can't just quit

09:00.407 --> 09:02.710
and let Poseidon beat us.
Ramal?

09:02.743 --> 09:04.945
There's a way out
if we work together,

09:04.978 --> 09:07.047
but escape has to start
from your cell.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.949
I'm no longer interested.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.886
The only thing left for you
to do is to beg.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.689
Beg that I might let you live
once my armies came,

09:15.723 --> 09:17.257
if only as a slave.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.292
I've been a slave
for the last seven years.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.761
I won't do it anymore!

09:22.963 --> 09:25.032
(soft chuckle)

09:25.065 --> 09:27.400
I will miss you
when you're dead,

09:27.434 --> 09:29.369
but only for a minute.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.604
Then you will be forgotten

09:30.638 --> 09:34.942
by both time
and the world.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.777
KELLERMAN:
Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.046
I have the weekends and...

09:39.079 --> 09:40.413
Well, no, I have the weekends

09:40.447 --> 09:41.649
and I don't want
a Wednesday afternoon.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.916
Why would I want that?

09:42.950 --> 09:46.286
Yeah, nobody does.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.156
(soft creaking)

09:49.189 --> 09:52.626
Uh-huh.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.662
No, that's okay, Cindy.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.804
Mm-hmm.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.072
Yeah, that's fine.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.306
What other days?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.607
What other days do you want?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.115
(sighs)
Actually, you know what?

10:15.148 --> 10:17.417
I don't want to
discuss this now.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.986
No, we'll talk about it later.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.688
Bye.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.625
Of all the things

10:25.659 --> 10:27.460
that mystify me in this world

10:27.494 --> 10:29.196
since I've been released,

10:29.229 --> 10:32.800
is that kale is the rage.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.034
Kale.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.336
(chuckles)
Theodore Bagwell.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.505
Thing that mystifies me equally

10:38.538 --> 10:40.007
is seven years ago,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.042
you exonerated Michael,

10:42.075 --> 10:43.176
Lincoln, all of them,

10:43.210 --> 10:44.845
except me.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.514
(laughs, then grunts)

10:47.547 --> 10:49.049
Really?
Yes!

10:49.082 --> 10:50.183
That's why you're here?

10:50.217 --> 10:51.985
Because I didn't exonerate you?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.353
A murderer,

10:53.386 --> 10:55.723
a sexual predator
a dozen times over.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.224
"Was" is the key word.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.292
I'm a man moving
toward the light now,

10:59.326 --> 11:00.794
and the light's beckoning me.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.764
I just don't know
who's pulling the strings.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.233
But Sara says
it's you.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.702
Oh, Sara put you onto me?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.203
Okay.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.972
I don't know who
the bigger idiot is,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.240
you or her.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.542
I was helping her.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.979
You were hacking the phone
and sending those people

11:19.012 --> 11:20.513
after her--
Don't...

11:20.547 --> 11:21.782
lie.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.384
(sighs)

11:24.417 --> 11:26.153
Now...

11:26.186 --> 11:29.056
how about you pour me one of
them nasty little kale jobbies,

11:29.089 --> 11:32.192
and tell me what's all this got
to do with Scofield and myself,

11:32.225 --> 11:33.493
who your friends are,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.095
who you are--
I want to see

11:35.128 --> 11:37.197
the true face
of who's pulling my strings

11:37.230 --> 11:38.732
once and for all.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.535
(knocking)

11:43.703 --> 11:45.038
You have two visitors
in the lobby.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.106
Tell them I'll be
right down.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.516
(clears throat)

11:56.549 --> 11:58.485
Hey.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.121
I got this, Grace.

12:06.994 --> 12:10.297
(gunfire and shouting
in distance)

12:12.332 --> 12:14.501
They're in the city.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.775
What are you doing?

12:21.809 --> 12:24.211
What do you think I'm doing?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.278
Don't run, you dog!

12:25.312 --> 12:26.646
Don't run!

12:26.679 --> 12:28.748
It is happening.
Be ready.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.054
(indistinct shouting)

12:34.087 --> 12:35.455
(woman screaming)

12:35.488 --> 12:37.157
This pardon better
get him out of here.
We don't have

12:37.190 --> 12:38.625
much time-- we have
to get to the warden.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.994
JAMIL:
What's going on?

12:41.028 --> 12:43.563
(excited chatter, shouting)

12:43.596 --> 12:46.066
(speaking Arabic)

12:46.099 --> 12:48.468
They're abandoning the prison.
That's why Ibrahim

12:48.501 --> 12:49.803
gave us that pardon.

12:49.837 --> 12:50.804
He knew it was worthless.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.506
You and C-Note get
the others to the airport

12:53.540 --> 12:55.508
as fast as you can--
there's maybe one flight out.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.609
Save two seats.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.345
All right?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.646
What are you
going to do?

12:59.679 --> 13:02.249
I'm gonna get my brother.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.517
(men shouting, clamoring)

13:12.625 --> 13:14.627
MAN:
Mustapha!

13:22.502 --> 13:24.637
Back up!

13:24.671 --> 13:27.174
Back up.
Anyone comes at me, dies.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.409
Understand?
You think you
can shoot all of us?

13:30.878 --> 13:33.313
Anyone else want
to play the lottery?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.315
Huh? You're filth.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.384
I'll let ISIL sort you out.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.622
ZAKAT:
Mustapha!

13:42.655 --> 13:44.457
Mustapha! Mustapha, wait!

13:44.491 --> 13:46.026
Don't lock me in here!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.394
You coward.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.428
Mustapha, please.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.364
Coward!

13:57.570 --> 14:00.807
I need to get in!
I need to get out!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.575
Well, give me the key.
I don't have the key.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.744
You passed the guy who does.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.849
(men clamoring,
gunfire in distance)

14:20.894 --> 14:23.363
(missile whistling through air)

14:34.074 --> 14:35.575
(indistinct shouts)

14:38.946 --> 14:40.580
Stay back!
I don't want to shoot you!

14:40.613 --> 14:41.581
(indistinct shout)

14:43.050 --> 14:45.452
(pounding on door)

14:48.821 --> 14:49.789
The guards are gone!

14:49.822 --> 14:51.291
They're abandoning
their posts!

14:52.725 --> 14:54.394
We're gonna be free!

14:54.427 --> 14:57.130
No. We're not free.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.632
Things just got a lot worse.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.934
MAN:
Push the gate open!

15:00.968 --> 15:02.402
Stop!

15:02.435 --> 15:04.104
What are you doing?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.939
We have to get through the gate!
If ISIL controls the city,

15:05.973 --> 15:08.475
like they say, it will be
a prison out there as well.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.609
We will be persecuted,

15:09.642 --> 15:11.878
as we have been in here,
only worse!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.080
At least there's
a chance!

15:13.113 --> 15:14.481
You want a chance?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.983
Our chance lies in there,

15:16.016 --> 15:17.884
in solitary.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.252
Our bargaining chip.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.720
We get Abu Ramal!

15:20.753 --> 15:22.722
We negotiate passage

15:22.755 --> 15:23.923
out of the country.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.492
No, it's madness.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.128
Come on. If we work together,
we can push open the gate.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.829
Is that you,
Princess?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.065
It is you.
We remember this one!

15:32.099 --> 15:34.801
Right? We remember him!
Please...

15:34.834 --> 15:36.603
Friend to Kaniel Outis,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.905
the man who would not
lend my brother a hand!

15:38.938 --> 15:40.807
The man who
killed my brother,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.410
as far as I'm
concerned, right?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.412
We are going to go in there
and get Abu Ramal!
No! Please!

15:45.445 --> 15:47.014
No! Please!
And when we are there,

15:47.047 --> 15:51.351
I am personally going to slice
Kaniel Outis' throat.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.354
And you are going to be the one
who's going to help me do it.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.989
No! You sent him!

15:56.023 --> 15:57.190
(men yelling)
Take him!

15:57.224 --> 15:58.691
All of you!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.927
Will you stay here?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.529
And let ISIL slaughter you?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.664
Or will you stand with me?

16:04.697 --> 16:05.965
And fight!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.367
(men yelling)

16:10.537 --> 16:12.272
Doesn't sound very promising!

16:12.305 --> 16:13.540
Ramal,

16:13.573 --> 16:14.674
you want to rethink
helping us?

16:14.707 --> 16:16.476
Escape has to start

16:16.509 --> 16:17.477
from your cell!

16:17.510 --> 16:19.179
All you infidels can go to hell!

16:19.212 --> 16:21.314
We are in hell, Ramal.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.016
Question is do you want out?

16:25.152 --> 16:27.154
Smash through the door!
(shouting)

16:31.991 --> 16:34.027
Tell me what to do.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.208
MAN:
Come on, come on...

16:50.210 --> 16:51.544
(woman screams)

16:52.879 --> 16:55.415
(men shouting in Arabic)

16:58.017 --> 16:59.219
(man shouting in Arabic)

17:12.199 --> 17:13.532
(gun cocks)

17:24.144 --> 17:25.778
KELLERMAN:
I'm not hacking
anybody's phones.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.680
You're so off
base on this,

17:27.714 --> 17:28.915
you have no idea.

17:28.948 --> 17:29.949
Am I?
(chuckles)

17:29.982 --> 17:31.251
Y-Yes.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.355
(spits)
That is terrible,

17:35.388 --> 17:37.357
by the way.
What is that,

17:37.390 --> 17:38.958
an act of contrition?

17:38.991 --> 17:41.261
Like a hair shirt?

17:41.294 --> 17:43.896
Torture yourself with kale
to make up for your sins?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.865
I don't have any sins
anymore, man.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.034
That's you.
How about
the sin of deceit?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.602
Hmm?

17:49.636 --> 17:52.872
A kale-drinking man named
Kellerman by the light of day,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.442
a murderous CIA rogue
named Poseidon at night.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.876
Poseidon?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.478
(whoops)
His eyes light up.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.579
She was right.

17:59.612 --> 18:02.715
Oh, you think I'm Poseidon?

18:02.749 --> 18:05.385
(laughing):
Okay.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.786
Are you mixed up with Poseidon?

18:06.819 --> 18:07.987
Oh, hell,

18:08.020 --> 18:09.122
we got to go old school
with this?

18:09.156 --> 18:10.290
Is that what you want?

18:10.323 --> 18:12.159
T-Bag
snapping fingers.
Ow!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.461
That's very-- you just gave
me something to work with.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.695
Poseidon? Poseidon.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.632
(scoffs)

18:19.666 --> 18:21.601
I'll tell you
about Poseidon.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.803
I mean, he's one of those myths
you hear about in the system.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.306
He's an operative
so untouchable,

18:26.339 --> 18:28.775
so deep, you couldn't find him
with a nuclear sub.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.743
Hence the nickname.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.679
And how does this involve me?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.847
What's he want with Michael?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.784
(banging)

18:37.817 --> 18:39.085
MICHAEL:
Ramal, listen closely.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.520
The brick with the
S-- it's loose.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.854
You got to remove it.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.159
(shouting, clamoring outside)

18:52.165 --> 18:54.301
It's a spoon, string.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.069
How?
A string a day
from my uniforms for four years.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.707
A spoon a guard overlooked
one time in a thousand.

19:01.874 --> 19:02.975
There's a water pipe above you.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.312
Hook it,
pull it down.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.979
Do it!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.458
Hey. Let me get this straight.
This is getting him out?

19:18.491 --> 19:20.059
MICHAEL: It's
getting us all out.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.561
This is a two-cell job,
mine and his.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.795
That's why I couldn't
pull it off

19:22.829 --> 19:24.130
when I was in that cell,

19:24.163 --> 19:25.698
because the guy
across from me,

19:25.732 --> 19:28.134
the guy in this cell,
wouldn't cooperate.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.369
(echoing):
We have to work together.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.670
Come on!

19:30.703 --> 19:32.339
No.
Cross!

19:32.372 --> 19:34.040
I'm not working with you.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.843
No. No.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.512
(yells) Come here!
Come on, sweetheart.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.415
Show them your pretty face!
Come on, get up here!

19:42.449 --> 19:44.016
Look! Stop
what you're doing

19:44.050 --> 19:45.685
and tell Kaniel Outis
I will kill the girl!

19:46.586 --> 19:47.987
(yells)

19:48.020 --> 19:49.756
Take him!

19:49.789 --> 19:52.225
Come on! I'm not
through with you yet!

19:52.259 --> 19:54.160
They're beating the crap
out of Sid. They'll kill him

19:54.193 --> 19:55.728
unless we surrender.
If we surrender,

19:55.762 --> 19:57.163
they'll kill us.
They only want Ramal.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.867
Our best chance of saving
Sid is getting out of here.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.035
Make them forget about him,
start chasing us.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.606
Okay, good.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.775
Now pick it up.
String the cord

20:08.808 --> 20:09.842
and pull it through.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.843
(man yelling,
banging on wall)

20:10.877 --> 20:12.178
Come on,
come on!

20:12.211 --> 20:13.212
Yeah!

20:14.714 --> 20:16.349
I will kill the girl,
I swear it!

20:16.383 --> 20:17.384
No!

20:23.290 --> 20:24.891
I will say it again,

20:24.924 --> 20:28.561
there will not be any killing
in this prison.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.562
Not on my watch.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.198
WHIP: This is
completely insane.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.232
It's a frigging Mexican
soap opera out here!

20:36.469 --> 20:38.305
Ramal, don't stop.
Don't start thinking.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.440
Don't pin your
hopes on one guard.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.608
Walk away!

20:41.641 --> 20:43.810
Hide in the cell block!

20:46.979 --> 20:48.615
What are you doing?

20:48.648 --> 20:49.882
The prison is done, brother.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.284
For the love of God.

20:51.318 --> 20:54.053
For the love of God,
a man seeks justice.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.756
In everything he does,
at all times.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.625
Now, everybody,
back in the block.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.226
There are no prisoners
and guards anymore.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.462
You realize that, right?

21:02.495 --> 21:04.597
If ISIL gets in here,

21:04.631 --> 21:07.300
we are all the enemy.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.801
Sinners,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.937
deviants...

21:10.970 --> 21:13.306
and those
that locked up their leader.

21:14.707 --> 21:17.243
You will be the only
guard that they catch.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.078
The noble one.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.649
They will behead you for it.
But...

21:22.682 --> 21:24.684
if we work together,

21:24.717 --> 21:26.285
we get Ramal,

21:26.319 --> 21:27.954
we have a bargaining chip.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.456
I will see to it

21:29.489 --> 21:33.292
that you will get out
with the rest of us.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.462
Just give me the keys
to solitary.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.430
I don't have the keys.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.298
I know you do.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.801
Join us

21:41.834 --> 21:43.703
and you will live.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.805
I give you my word.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.340
I don't have them.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.878
(grunting)
(prisoners cheering)

21:51.911 --> 21:53.446
Kill him!

21:53.480 --> 21:55.382
(cheering)

21:55.415 --> 21:58.685
But you have something
much better, huh?

22:02.889 --> 22:04.290
Move. Move!

22:04.323 --> 22:05.892
WHIP:
Oh, my God.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.795
Oh, my God.
They killed the guard!

22:08.828 --> 22:10.897
They got his gun!
They're coming for us!

22:17.570 --> 22:19.706
Got to make this count, Ramal.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.475
String that fishing pole
through that slot.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.176
That's right.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.478
Now, you can
remove the pinions

22:25.512 --> 22:26.879
on my door-- the hinges.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.247
There are
two of them.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.852
No way.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.688
What are you doing?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.258
What are you doing?

22:39.291 --> 22:40.593
I'm doing mine.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.361
We don't have time
for this, Ramal!

22:51.471 --> 22:52.939
I'm telling you,
it's a two-cell job,

22:52.972 --> 22:54.574
that's the point.
That side of the wing

22:54.607 --> 22:56.342
is new construction.
The pinions

22:56.375 --> 22:58.177
are covered in the hinges--
you can't pull them.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.580
This side is original.
They're open, loose.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.515
You want me to free you?

23:02.549 --> 23:05.518
Yes, and I, in turn, free you
with those keys, down there.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.520
Why would I trust you more than
the madman out there?

23:07.554 --> 23:09.789
'Cause you just heard
what his word is worth.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.729
Kick it.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.532
(thumping)

23:19.566 --> 23:21.534
This is it. It's all about
whose word you trust.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.936
I promise you-- you release me,

23:23.970 --> 23:25.972
I release you.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.320
Little more,
little more.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.397
Thank God. Come on.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.900
Okay, the bottom.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.102
Yes!

23:56.135 --> 23:57.303
(thumping continues)

23:57.336 --> 23:58.471
Come on,

23:58.505 --> 24:00.339
come on. Come on.
Come on.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.575
Yes!

24:02.609 --> 24:03.676
Almost there!

24:03.710 --> 24:05.011
(grunting)

24:13.052 --> 24:14.754
WHIP:
Yes.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.255
Come on.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.256
(thumping)

24:17.289 --> 24:18.958
Got to hurry up, come on.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.796
Yes. Yes, come on!

24:33.706 --> 24:35.708
RAMAL:
Where are you going?

24:35.742 --> 24:36.843
Open my door.

24:40.412 --> 24:41.514
I'm getting the hell
out of here.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.950
RAMAL:
Open my door.

24:43.983 --> 24:47.186
Leave him, man, you crazy?
Open my door.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.488
Once we're outside
these walls, we need

24:49.522 --> 24:50.990
safe passage out of the country.

24:51.023 --> 24:52.491
Even now, you negotiate.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.793
(door straining)

24:53.826 --> 24:57.029
We work together or we both die.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.800
You have my word.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.401
Open the door.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.870
(mouths)

25:10.610 --> 25:12.178
We got to go now.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.546
(clamoring, banging)

25:13.580 --> 25:15.582
(cheering)

25:18.751 --> 25:21.420
(indistinct chatter)

25:21.453 --> 25:22.922
No, no!

25:22.955 --> 25:25.524
(indistinct conversations)

25:28.695 --> 25:29.896
KID:
Mr. Tic Tac.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.098
What are you doing here?

25:32.131 --> 25:33.365
You gonna fight ISIL men?

25:33.399 --> 25:35.034
Get out of here,
kid, hide!

25:35.067 --> 25:37.203
This is no place for you.
You gonna fight ISIL men?

25:37.236 --> 25:38.971
Yes.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.042
Listen very closely,
all right?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.678
American!
American!

25:45.712 --> 25:47.013
American!

25:47.046 --> 25:48.948
(speaking Arabic)

26:13.439 --> 26:15.341
You go to Bubble Gum Man now?
Yeah.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.947
Thanks for your help.
Here, take that.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.249
Get somewhere safe, okay?

26:26.653 --> 26:29.455
Mr. Tic Tac goes
to Bubble Gum Man!

26:29.488 --> 26:31.490
(indistinct chatter)

26:33.125 --> 26:36.629
Ramal... don't want to kill you.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.931
Just your friends.
You understand?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.100
What are we doing in here?
This is not helping us.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.334
You're gonna make
a phone call

26:42.368 --> 26:44.603
so you can hold up
your end of the deal.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.438
There's an auto body shop
off Nashwan Plaza.

26:46.472 --> 26:47.907
I want vehicles there,
full tanks of gas

26:47.940 --> 26:49.809
so we can get to the border,
all of us.

26:49.842 --> 26:50.910
I'm not going with you
to the border.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.344
MICHAEL:
You don't have a choice.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.980
We're gonna ride to the border,
then say sayonara.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.414
You're our insurance.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.482
CROSS:
Ramal, I don't want to kill you.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.017
You understand?

26:58.050 --> 27:00.687
Or would you rather be
their insurance? Take it.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.164
(speaking Arabic)

27:12.198 --> 27:15.034
I want to know what he's saying.
He could be screwing us.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.703
He's screwing with us,
all right.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.037
We just need to screw
with him first.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.371
Where's Ja?

27:19.405 --> 27:21.140
I don't know.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.877
(Ja coughing)

27:24.911 --> 27:26.312
Oxycodone...
Hey, we got to peel.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.814
Percocet...

27:27.847 --> 27:29.716
Come on, you Japanese
junkie son of a bitch.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.617
I'm Korean,
you Canadian monkey.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.386
Canadian? Oh, that's
really funny, Ja.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.655
You'd split my sides if we
weren't about to be slaughtered.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.158
Hey, remember what
Woody Allen said.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.127
What did he say?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.829
"I don't mind dying.

27:42.862 --> 27:46.132
I just don't want to be around
when it happens."

27:46.165 --> 27:47.399
Hey, come on.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.501
We need you, okay?

27:49.535 --> 27:50.803
MICHAEL:
What's the holdup?

27:50.837 --> 27:52.872
(door opens)

28:15.094 --> 28:17.096
KELLERMAN:
Scofield's a dead man.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.230
He's tangling with Poseidon.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.431
I see what you're
doing here.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.368
Talking Poseidon,
"third person,"

28:22.401 --> 28:23.736
like you're not him.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.071
State Department has been

28:25.104 --> 28:26.839
looking for Poseidon for years,

28:26.873 --> 28:29.541
you idiot. He's a
rogue CIA operative.

28:29.575 --> 28:30.609
Nobody knows who he is.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.511
Here we go.
I know it's a little

28:32.544 --> 28:34.246
above your pay grade,
being a common criminal.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.748
I mean, we're talking
about a single man.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.283
Right? A hawk

28:37.316 --> 28:39.618
who apparently doesn't
like how the White House

28:39.651 --> 28:41.253
goes about foreign policy,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.355
and decided to take matters
into his own hands.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.624
Not with armies,
not with invasions,

28:45.657 --> 28:47.193
but by getting a
single person killed,

28:47.226 --> 28:49.195
by getting a single person
elected to office,

28:49.228 --> 28:52.731
by getting a single person
released from prison.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.267
Prison, like the one in Yemen,
where Michael's at.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.769
You want my guess?

28:56.803 --> 29:00.472
It's Abu Ramal that
Poseidon wants free.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.374
Guy I seen on the prison telly.

29:02.408 --> 29:05.577
Wait, I thought the CIA was
supposed to kill terrorists,

29:05.611 --> 29:07.546
not release them.
Poseidon is no longer CIA.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.081
He doesn't report
to anybody.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.317
He just pursues
his own ideology.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.585
Okay, for instance, listen.

29:13.619 --> 29:15.922
Let's say you think
Russia and Iran

29:15.955 --> 29:18.490
are having too much influence
in the Middle East,

29:18.524 --> 29:19.725
and you don't
think Washington

29:19.758 --> 29:21.493
is getting the job done.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.895
You free Ramal.

29:22.929 --> 29:25.431
Sure, he's an Islamic
radical nut job,

29:25.464 --> 29:27.599
but he will fight Iran
and Russia for you.

29:27.633 --> 29:30.336
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.438
And what's so shrewd
about Poseidon

29:32.471 --> 29:34.106
is he does it all
without a network,

29:34.140 --> 29:36.742
which is why he's
so hard to find.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.410
One man can pull strings
like that?

29:38.444 --> 29:40.746
One man manipulating
a handful of others.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.582
Abu Ramal is a monster.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.585
And there's a spot in hell
reserved for him,

29:46.618 --> 29:50.089
but the hottest spot
is reserved for Poseidon,

29:50.122 --> 29:52.624
because he is letting Ramal
loose on the world again.

29:52.658 --> 29:55.527
Those men, they have
the blood of thousands,

29:55.561 --> 29:58.130
thousands on their hands.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.867
Compared to them, you and me
are a couple of angels.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.369
(quiet laugh)

30:03.402 --> 30:05.537
"Angels"?
Mm-hmm.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.106
You find out who Poseidon is,

30:07.139 --> 30:09.041
and how Scofield
is wrapped up in it,

30:09.075 --> 30:11.510
maybe your fate...

30:11.543 --> 30:13.445
is to be a patriot.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.647
(muffled gunshot, glass breaks)

30:15.681 --> 30:17.649
What...

30:17.683 --> 30:19.718
(gunshot)
(shouts, grunting)

30:24.356 --> 30:26.558
(grunting)

30:42.909 --> 30:44.443
(chuckles)

30:50.950 --> 30:52.384
There's a time for everything.

30:54.786 --> 30:57.423
911? I need help.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.191
Now.

31:01.727 --> 31:05.331
(men shouting)

31:05.364 --> 31:06.598
WHIP:
They're going over the top.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.467
Let's go.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.551
Go, go, go, go, go!

31:25.584 --> 31:27.386
This way!

31:33.125 --> 31:35.394
It's locked!

31:35.427 --> 31:36.895
It's a dead end.

31:36.929 --> 31:39.031
No, no, no, no. No.
No, no, no, no.

31:39.065 --> 31:40.432
Ramal?

31:43.069 --> 31:45.871
Hide!

31:45.904 --> 31:48.307
CROSS: I don't want to kill you.
Just your friends.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.244
You understand?
Sid, you're alive?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.981
SID: We'll see about that.
Ramal?!

31:55.014 --> 31:56.482
Let's hand
the son of a bitch over.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.084
Won't work.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.551
They'll gun us down anyway.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.920
Can't just wait here and die.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.391
The game is up.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.993
Come out.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.463
(feet shuffling on floor)

32:11.497 --> 32:12.464
(gunshots)

32:12.498 --> 32:16.368
(groans)

32:20.772 --> 32:22.841
Anyone who gets between me

32:22.874 --> 32:25.644
and Abu Ramal dies.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.347
You understand?!

32:31.183 --> 32:32.784
Where is Ramal?

32:32.818 --> 32:35.154
Tell me now!

32:35.187 --> 32:37.189
(speaks Arabic)

32:39.625 --> 32:41.660
There's a boy.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.830
Ithaca, New York.
Mike Scofield.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.766
If I don't make it
out of here alive,

32:47.799 --> 32:49.868
tell him his father
loves him very much.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.670
His father?

32:58.244 --> 32:59.645
If I don't smother that gun,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.047
he'll kill us all.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.723
(yells)

33:17.996 --> 33:20.166
(screaming)

33:32.744 --> 33:36.515
(men shouting)

33:45.557 --> 33:47.959
Move back!

33:51.863 --> 33:54.600
Move back! Go!

33:54.633 --> 33:56.768
Let me through!

34:06.078 --> 34:09.380
Michael! Michael!

34:16.422 --> 34:18.724
Michael? Michael!

34:36.842 --> 34:38.277
Poseidon sent you?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.777
Where's your friend?

34:39.811 --> 34:40.978
He's long gone.

34:41.012 --> 34:42.648
Back door.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.251
Locked from the inside.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.485
VAN GOGH:
He's in here.

34:46.518 --> 34:47.518
Find him.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.889
I was you once,
killing for a lie.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.059
Now you're what?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.827
Dying for the truth?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.797
It's human nature
to find stuff out,

34:58.830 --> 35:01.567
so you will.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.236
Or she will.

35:04.270 --> 35:07.373
And then the lie
has to kill the truth.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.009
Which one of you
is gonna die ne...

35:22.454 --> 35:25.457
(distant siren wailing)

35:33.031 --> 35:34.933
Time to get scarce.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.336
Hey!

35:39.571 --> 35:42.040
(sirens wailing)

35:42.073 --> 35:44.743
What did he say to you?

35:46.011 --> 35:48.380
Nothing.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.329
(engine starts)

36:09.067 --> 36:11.069
(panting)

36:18.444 --> 36:20.145
Auto shop's a
few blocks up.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.348
And your men
better be coming.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.482
They will be there.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.783
Where is Ja?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.656
Ja,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.524
what are you doing?
I'm starving, man.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.260
You know how long it's
been since I seen fruit?

36:34.293 --> 36:36.728
MICHAEL:
You're stopping to eat?

36:36.762 --> 36:38.196
Are you high?!

36:38.230 --> 36:40.031
Don't come at me, man.
You're not my mama.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.834
You know what? You're done.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.336
You're gone.
What?

36:44.370 --> 36:47.105
Wait.
I said, walk!
You're a liability!

36:47.138 --> 36:50.041
Wait, wait. You said
you'd get me out,

36:50.075 --> 36:52.210
all the way home.
That was the deal.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.846
(grunts)

36:54.880 --> 36:56.882
MICHAEL:
Ramal, this man follows us,

36:56.915 --> 36:58.183
tell your men
to shoot him.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.486
Gladly.

37:30.616 --> 37:32.318
LINCOLN:
Where'd you go, Michael?

37:33.652 --> 37:35.987
Where'd you go?

38:00.712 --> 38:01.947
(door opens)

38:07.386 --> 38:08.820
There you are, my men.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.558
Seize these dogs so that
we can put them down.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.630
Ramal.

38:18.664 --> 38:22.701
Ramal, what are you doing?

38:22.734 --> 38:24.169
You thought you tricked me?

38:24.202 --> 38:27.172
Take the long way around

38:27.205 --> 38:29.675
while your friend...

38:31.176 --> 38:34.546
...gets here first
to get weapons.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.783
You were going to screw me.
That's the American slang.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.951
Isn't it?
You were gonna screw me.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.187
So much for our word.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.990
Lying to enemies.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.925
It's called Taqiyya.

38:48.394 --> 38:49.995
Take off the camera.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.365
I will show the world

38:53.399 --> 38:55.634
what happens

38:55.667 --> 38:58.504
when you screw Abu Ramal.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.472
On your knees!

39:00.506 --> 39:02.874
It's not gonna happen.
Make them on their knees!

39:02.908 --> 39:05.711
(men speaking Arabic)

39:20.959 --> 39:22.327
(grunting)

39:22.360 --> 39:23.729
Enough!

39:23.762 --> 39:25.531
(men speaking Arabic)

39:25.564 --> 39:27.866
Drop your weapons.

39:35.441 --> 39:37.709
Step away from my brother.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.412
Linc.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.113
How much do you love
this brother of yours?

39:48.820 --> 39:51.657
Why don't you step down
from that truck?

39:53.391 --> 39:55.561
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
No, it's not going down

39:55.594 --> 39:57.563
like this, okay? Just...

39:57.596 --> 40:00.098
stop. I got way too many
questions for my friend here.

40:00.131 --> 40:03.368
Step back!
I went to prison
for killing

40:03.401 --> 40:05.036
a guy in a bar fight.
I didn't even want

40:05.070 --> 40:07.138
to get into it, okay? He starts
talking yang to my girl.

40:07.172 --> 40:08.540
I tell him to beat it.

40:08.574 --> 40:11.409
He pulls a knife,
and I see red.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.712
One second later,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.982
I'm holding his bloody knife,
and it's his body on the ground.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.585
You're not that fast.
One second.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.052
Please don't do this.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.988
You will lose.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.423
Listen to your friend.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.826
I'm talking to you, Ramal.

40:27.859 --> 40:31.129
I told you!
Step down from that truck.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.664
Pick up your weapons!

40:32.698 --> 40:34.900
You've got one second till
that one second happens.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.568
Go to hell. (groans)

40:36.602 --> 40:39.805
(shouting in Arabic)

40:42.941 --> 40:46.478
(loud groaning)

40:46.512 --> 40:48.580
(engine rumbling nearby)

40:48.614 --> 40:50.649
(tires squealing)

40:50.682 --> 40:52.684
We got more coming!

40:52.718 --> 40:54.953
WHIP: And more over here!
This is a big problem.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.055
WHIP: Let's get the
hell out of here.

40:59.057 --> 41:02.828
(gunfire)

41:07.198 --> 41:08.800
(groans)

41:12.370 --> 41:14.305
(groans softly)

41:23.582 --> 41:25.350
A&W: You wanted
to see us?
Ouch.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.925
Come on. Come on.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.247
(camera shutter clicking)

41:57.515 --> 42:00.285
Behold the villain.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.955
(indistinct shouting)

42:11.863 --> 42:15.567
Who the hell is this guy?

42:15.601 --> 42:17.769
He's my brother.

42:20.806 --> 42:23.775
He's my brother.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.510
I can't believe this.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.714
I just can't believe this.
I can't believe this.

42:28.747 --> 42:32.250
Back at the prison. Why?

42:32.283 --> 42:34.119
Why did you say...
I had to deny you.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.254
You were... you were filming me.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.625
They can't know.
Who can't know?

42:39.658 --> 42:40.926
They can't know
I'm getting out.
Who?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.895
I'll explain
everything later, just...

42:43.929 --> 42:46.297
Sara and-and Mike?

42:46.331 --> 42:48.033
They're good.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.801
They're fine.
Oh, thank God.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.870
Thank God.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.371
Questions just keep
piling up, huh?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.373
That's you.
(man speaking Arabic on TV)

42:55.406 --> 42:56.742
SID:
It's all of us.

42:56.775 --> 42:58.476
What are they saying?

42:58.509 --> 43:02.380
That ISIL has taken over
the government station.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.950
That their beloved
leader, Abu Ramal,

43:04.983 --> 43:08.319
has been martyred.

43:08.353 --> 43:11.222
That we're the
ones that did it.

43:11.256 --> 43:12.557
The entire army
of ISIL

43:12.590 --> 43:15.193
just declared war on us.
