WEBVTT

00:52.220 --> 00:53.262
Shh!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.912
Come.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.998
Come.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.259
Come.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.261
Come.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.442
Well, we're almost to the
Wetherby estate, gang.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.946
It sure is nice of Sharon to ask
us up here for the weekend.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.282
There's so many groovy things to do.

01:54.448 --> 01:59.412
Yeah, like swimming and eating, and
tennis and eating, and riding and eating...

01:59.578 --> 02:01.914
and eating and... Huh?

02:09.463 --> 02:10.756
How do you like that?

02:11.716 --> 02:13.217
Hey, look up there.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.763
Jeepers, someone's going
into that old mansion.

02:17.972 --> 02:22.101
Like, wow.
Who'd do a kooky thing like that?

02:22.393 --> 02:24.478
I don't know.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.696
Gee, it's sure good to see all of you.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.949
But I hope this wasn't the wrong
weekend for you to come up here.

02:37.116 --> 02:40.411
- Why's that, Sharon?
- Well, the last few nights...

02:40.578 --> 02:43.205
we've been hearing
a lot of strange noises.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.876
And now it looks like
my Uncle Stuart has vanished.

02:47.126 --> 02:50.212
Could it have been him we saw
going into that old mansion?

02:50.379 --> 02:54.258
You mean the Kingston mansion?
Maybe we'd better go up there and see.

02:54.425 --> 02:55.885
Uh-uh!

02:58.721 --> 03:01.432
Uncle Stuart? Uncle Stuart?

03:04.143 --> 03:07.104
Like, you know,
there's no sign of him anywhere.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.315
Look, someone's in the shadows.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.655
Uncle Stuart.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.325
He's become an old man.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.660
What happened, Stuart?

03:21.827 --> 03:26.332
It started when a ghostly voice
called out from the old mansion.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.001
I had to obey it.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.255
<i>It drew me out of the house.</i>

03:33.756 --> 03:36.342
<i>I was in a trance.</i>

03:36.842 --> 03:40.012
<i>I went past the Kingston mausoleum...</i>

03:41.555 --> 03:45.059
<i>and finally into the old mansion.</i>

03:47.186 --> 03:52.858
<i>And there is where I saw
the ghost of Elias Kingston.</i>

03:53.067 --> 03:56.695
The Wetherby fortune belongs to me.

03:56.862 --> 04:00.699
Unless it is returned to this
mansion before morning...

04:00.866 --> 04:05.955
the entire family shall suffer
this terrible fate.

04:11.836 --> 04:16.715
That's when he made me an old man,
as a warning to you all.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.509
What are we going to do?

04:18.676 --> 04:21.804
First of all, I'm going
to call the sheriff.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.724
That's strange. The phone's dead.

04:25.891 --> 04:29.520
Why don't you go get the sheriff,
Mr. Wetherby. We'll wait here.

04:29.687 --> 04:32.231
We'll keep an eye on Uncle Stuart
until you get back.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.567
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- Sure.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.902
And just to make sure nothing
else happens...

04:37.111 --> 04:39.071
we'll all take turns standing guard.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.323
Who's gonna stand the first watch?

04:41.490 --> 04:43.242
Who else? The watchdog.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.578
Right. The watchdog.

04:47.079 --> 04:49.957
- That's me?
- That's right. That's you.

04:50.124 --> 04:55.379
Just think, Scooby, no ghostly voice
will get past your keen sense of hearing.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.842
Huh?

05:00.885 --> 05:04.221
That old hard-of-hearing trick
isn't gonna work tonight, Scooby.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.985
Come.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.989
Come.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.998
Where'd he go?

05:40.132 --> 05:42.760
Hey, what's with the bugle call, Scooby?

05:44.637 --> 05:48.140
Uh-oh. It looks like
Uncle Stuart's gone again.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.726
He's not the only one.
Sharon's gone too.

05:50.893 --> 05:51.894
But, like, where?

05:52.061 --> 05:53.981
We'd better get ourselves
up to that old mansion.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.315
And fast.

06:05.407 --> 06:09.662
I don't see any sign of Sharon,
Uncle Stuart or the ghost.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.332
Like, maybe we're in luck and
he's out haunting another house.

06:13.499 --> 06:18.003
Say, what have you got on your feet,
roller skates?

06:18.170 --> 06:21.507
- Why are you wearing those silly things?
- I'm not taking any chances.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.927
If we do see that ghost,
he'll never catch me.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.179
Come on, let's keep looking.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.870
I wonder if ghosts can hide in little pots.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.541
I guess not.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.543
Yipe! Woah! Woah!

07:12.141 --> 07:14.143
Scooby-Doo!

07:17.688 --> 07:18.689
Ah!

07:18.856 --> 07:21.233
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

07:44.757 --> 07:46.175
GHOST
Psst. Psst!

08:08.822 --> 08:12.576
Wow. How soggy can a guy get?

08:16.955 --> 08:22.378
If there's one thing I can't stand,
it's taking a bath in a haunted house.

08:23.379 --> 08:26.882
Whether you know it or not, Scooby,
you found our first clue.

08:27.383 --> 08:29.134
I did?

08:29.426 --> 08:34.139
Sure. Who ever heard of a ghost needing
a watchdog to scare anybody away?

08:34.348 --> 08:36.433
Like, you mean there isn't any ghosts?

08:36.600 --> 08:38.644
Well, I haven't seen any. Yet.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.647
And we haven't seen
Sharon or her uncle either.

08:41.814 --> 08:47.277
Hey, was Uncle Stuart wearing
a blue suit, red tie and tennis shoes?

08:47.444 --> 08:49.113
Yeah, when we last saw him.

08:49.279 --> 08:53.992
Then I think we found him.
Only he looks a little older now.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.246
Wow. I guess that ghost
wasn't kidding.

08:57.413 --> 09:00.290
That's just about as old as you can get.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.001
It sure would help
if we could find another clue.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.170
Uh-huh. I found one.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.173
- Groovy. What is it?
- Him.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.093
It's the ghost!

09:11.260 --> 09:13.262
Ghost?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.854
This is the last warning.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.898
Either the fortune is here by morning...

09:25.065 --> 09:29.486
or all those in the Wetherby house
shall grow old.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.030
Now go.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.953
Wowwy. Old Horrible really said
a frightful mouthful.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.123
- But we're not gonna let that scare us.
- We're not?

09:41.290 --> 09:44.042
No, Shaggy.
We're gonna solve this mystery.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.712
Hey, where's Scooby? Uh-oh.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.630
I bet he's in that closet.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.508
"Out to lunch." Can you imagine?

09:51.717 --> 09:54.887
Yeah, with Scooby,
I wouldn't be surprised.

09:59.308 --> 10:03.061
How do you like that?
He didn't even invite me.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.866
Hey, that was the ghost.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.452
Yeah, he went into the mausoleum.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.497
Come on, let's see what he's up to.

10:22.539 --> 10:26.877
Okay, Shaggy. Use Velma's
fingerprinting kit and dust for prints.

10:27.044 --> 10:32.007
Right, Freddy. I'll give it
the old Sherlock Holmes touch.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.677
Like, wow. Look at all them fingerprints.

10:36.053 --> 10:39.014
Not my hand, silly. That door.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.062
Freddy, we got something.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.356
Just as I thought. Fingerprints.

10:47.523 --> 10:50.484
Wait a minute.
Ghosts wouldn't leave fingerprints.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.909
- Like, maybe he can turn into a bat.
- Don't be silly.

10:59.076 --> 11:03.580
Okay, Scooby, go in there
and sniff around for that ghost.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.834
Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

11:07.960 --> 11:11.421
- Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
- Uh-uh.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.758
I'll give you one. How about two?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.718
Three. Four?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.929
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.348
I'll go.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.101
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

11:31.108 --> 11:35.279
Like, there's times I'll do anything
for a Scooby Snack.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.531
It's okay. Come on in.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.368
- There's no ghost in here.
- Well, we know he came in.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.538
There's something on that table.

11:44.705 --> 11:48.542
Hey, this might be a clue.
A book on crystalomacy.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.546
Crystal O'Macy?
I used to know a Crystal Nerdlinger.

11:52.796 --> 11:57.551
It's not a girl, silly. It's a book
about how to use a crystal ball.

11:57.801 --> 12:01.096
- You mean the kind a fortuneteller uses?
- Right.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.224
Say, there's an old swami place in town.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.311
Maybe there's some kind
of a connection.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.938
Zoinks, the door!

12:10.814 --> 12:12.566
Hey, we're locked in.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.569
Well, let's hope there's
a secret way out of here.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.404
Start tapping on the walls.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.376
Hey. Like, what happened to Scooby?

12:31.627 --> 12:34.588
He was right there a second ago.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.425
Huh?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.684
It's a secret passage.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.812
You did it, Scooby.
You found the way out.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.148
I did?

12:53.315 --> 12:56.193
Well, Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

13:00.364 --> 13:03.867
That secret passage
was a shortcut to the Wetherby estate.

13:04.076 --> 13:07.037
I wonder if it has anything to do
with Sharon's disappearance.

13:07.204 --> 13:12.542
I don't know. But maybe we'll find
the answer here at the swami's place.

13:17.673 --> 13:21.093
It looks like the swami's
out swami-ing somewhere else.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.845
Then I guess he won't mind
if we take a look around.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.889
I wonder what's in here.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.892
Daphne, not the storage closet.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.896
Well, Daphne, you did it again.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.902
Uh-oh. Like, someone's coming.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.615
Yoo-hoo. Swami. Oh, Swami.

13:44.741 --> 13:48.078
Oh, there you are.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.417
- Oh, no. A customer.
- And she thinks Scooby's the swami.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.713
Shaggy, you better throw your voice
and make Scooby sound like a swami.

13:57.879 --> 14:02.259
- Yeah, I better.
- Mr. Swami, I have something to ask you.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.761
Good evening. Please be seated.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.645
Oh, swami, tell me, what do you see
in the crystal ball?

14:14.604 --> 14:17.941
- My reflection.
- Your reflection? My word.

14:18.150 --> 14:23.447
No, wait. I see a tall,
handsome man in your future.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.158
And you're dancing together
cheek to cheek.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.287
Now he's whispering something to you.

14:30.662 --> 14:35.167
- He is? What is the dear boy saying?
- "Get off my foot."

14:36.418 --> 14:40.088
Enough of this. I want my palm read.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.549
Yes, ma'am.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.803
You did say "red."

14:47.721 --> 14:49.973
How dare you!

14:50.432 --> 14:54.478
How about that? All that advice
and she didn't even pay us a dime.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.485
I hope that's the end
of the customers for a while.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.825
Okay, gang. Let's get on
with our investigation.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.952
Hey, look.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.496
The table's floating.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.791
Zoinks! It's the gooney ghost!

15:16.333 --> 15:19.002
You did not do as I said.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.255
Now you shall pay.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.801
Hey, look out! Duck!

15:25.967 --> 15:28.136
It's after us!

15:32.724 --> 15:34.726
Here it comes again.

15:38.230 --> 15:41.733
I've heard of flying saucers,
but this is silly.

15:43.860 --> 15:47.197
Run. Run. Run.

15:50.325 --> 15:52.494
We got rid of it.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.956
We did?

15:56.414 --> 15:58.708
Then, like, what's that?

16:00.752 --> 16:03.922
- He's a real joker.
- I'm not laughing.

16:05.882 --> 16:06.925
Duck!

16:08.552 --> 16:10.095
Look out, Scooby!

16:10.345 --> 16:11.847
Huh?

16:20.105 --> 16:22.399
Scooby caught the table.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.903
Man, this flew like it was jet-propelled.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.905
You mean like fan-propelled.

16:29.114 --> 16:33.201
See? A fan-type motor underneath
gave it the power.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.911
Are you okay, Scooby?

16:35.412 --> 16:38.248
Huh? I'm okay.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.877
Hey, look, suitcases.
Maybe somebody just moved in.

16:42.043 --> 16:43.545
Then let's move out.

16:43.879 --> 16:46.256
And look what I found.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.508
A professional makeup kit.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.343
And what's that?

16:51.553 --> 16:54.264
It looks like a TV camera.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.892
You're right, Shaggy.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.687
Yeah. It's a miniature TV camera.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.148
Hey, smile, Scooby.

17:04.274 --> 17:06.902
That's how the ghost got
on the crystal ball.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.070
Closed-circuit TV.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.573
See, Scooby?

17:11.740 --> 17:13.283
That's how you look on TV.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.787
What a ham.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.290
- Well, we got a lot of clues.
- Huh?

17:20.957 --> 17:22.709
- We do?
- She's right.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.587
Enough clues to turn the tables
on that ghost.

17:25.754 --> 17:28.048
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

17:31.509 --> 17:37.682
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Ghost!
I'm here with the fortune. Yoo-hoo!

17:37.849 --> 17:40.602
<i>- Noe-hoe!
- Uh-oh.</i>

17:42.604 --> 17:48.443
Ah, good. You brought the fortune.
How fortunate for you.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.115
Stay until I see with my own eyes.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.953
It's a trick.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.959
I'II turn you to bones!

18:04.125 --> 18:06.336
The plan's working, Scooby.

18:06.503 --> 18:10.715
- You can't get away!
- Quick, get behind the curtain.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.185
Scooby, I hope the ghost doesn't find us.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.649
OW!

18:28.858 --> 18:33.446
Perfecto. I got my shoes,
now let's join the gang.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.955
I can hear the ghost coming.
Get ready for phase two.

18:43.373 --> 18:46.710
- All set, Shaggy?
- Yeah. Let's go.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.297
- He's in the hall.
- Turn on the projector.

18:52.549 --> 18:56.344
Stop, or I'll mummify you!

18:57.387 --> 18:59.889
Wait. Hold it.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.730
This place is really haunted.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.566
Now watch what he does when he
sees the tape of you, Scooby.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.859
Yeah.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.819
Oh, no!

19:13.194 --> 19:15.405
That does it.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.366
It's working, Sharon.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.703
He's going into the secret
room, where he had me tied up.

19:22.078 --> 19:27.584
Well, Miss Sharon, I still have you,
and the fortune shall yet be mine...

19:27.792 --> 19:31.880
How did that get here?
Let me out of here.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.674
Here he comes.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.761
Golly, he's running
like a ghost was after him.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.764
- Now. Throw it!
- Bombs away!

19:46.186 --> 19:48.938
I guess that about wraps up
the ghost story.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.441
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

19:52.859 --> 19:56.696
Mr. Wetherby, this ghost really
doesn't need any introduction.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.948
As soon as we clean him up...

19:59.115 --> 20:02.118
I'm sure you'll recognize him.
There. Look familiar?

20:03.578 --> 20:06.581
- Uncle Stuart.
- Like, in person.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.918
He thought he could scare you
into giving up the family fortune.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.629
That ghostly wailing
was only a recording.

20:12.837 --> 20:16.132
And by a clever use of makeup,
he made himself look old.

20:16.341 --> 20:21.137
When I came downstairs to investigate a
noise, I saw Uncle Stuart's wig blow off.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.933
- I knew he wasn't old.
- So he had to take you prisoner.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.310
But where does the swami come in?

20:27.477 --> 20:29.896
What better way
for a swindler to disappear?

20:30.063 --> 20:33.233
Uncle Stuart, why did you do it?

20:33.483 --> 20:36.903
Well, I guess he can explain it
to the sheriff when he gets here.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.906
- I bet you kids are starving.
- Groovy.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.741
Zoinks, that's for me.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.246
Hey, what's this?

20:46.746 --> 20:49.582
"Scooby-Doo was here."

20:50.125 --> 20:53.336
The whole turkey? Gone?

20:55.505 --> 20:58.591
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

21:52.270 --> 21:53.270
Shh!
