WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:03.865
Brent Riley,
Ty Borden's probation officer.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.437
There are plenty
of other placements out there

00:05.538 --> 00:06.903
the boy might be better suited.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.167
There are three horses that still need
their legs washed and wrapped.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.469
How am I supposed
to do everything?

00:10.577 --> 00:12.875
You know what, Ty?
That's what hired hands do.

00:13.013 --> 00:13.911
It's their job.

00:14.047 --> 00:18.507
...just went through a nasty divorce.
And I have taken on my nephew.

00:18.651 --> 00:22.781
If there's anything I...
Or we can do...

00:22.889 --> 00:24.220
Well, I might take you up on that.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.349
I think every boy needs
a good man in his life.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.120
Heck, who doesn't, hey?

00:28.261 --> 00:29.922
I'm just here to see my daughters.
That's my right.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.054
Don't talk to me about your rights.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.395
This is my property,
and I want you off it.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.297
I don't wanna fight you.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.866
Not now.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:26.186 --> 01:27.949
Amy?

01:39.666 --> 01:40.860
I won!

01:40.967 --> 01:42.901
Yeah, right.
Except it's not a race.

01:43.002 --> 01:46.130
That's what everybody says
when they don't win!

01:56.616 --> 02:00.074
So, we still good with the plan?

02:00.753 --> 02:01.219
I don't know.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.721
I was thinking, he could go
for a longer workout today.

02:04.324 --> 02:08.988
Yeah, I guess I could go
a couple more miles myself.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.557
Great. So, we'll take care of it
later, then?

02:12.031 --> 02:13.623
Yeah, there's no rush.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.027
This afternoon might be way better.

02:22.775 --> 02:23.901
Who are we kidding?

02:48.401 --> 02:49.595
I still don't feel good

02:49.702 --> 02:51.727
about this Ben Stillman guy
staying in mom's room.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.601
Well, we can't throw him
in the barn.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.436
His aunt's paying us a fortune.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.804
How do we even know he wants
to learn what we do here?

02:59.946 --> 03:02.039
She says he does.

03:02.148 --> 03:03.376
Ever since the Open House,

03:03.483 --> 03:05.542
Lisa Stillman thinks
you can do no wrong.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.744
Hmm. So it's all my fault, then?

03:07.887 --> 03:09.479
Hey, do you want
to grab this from me?

03:11.357 --> 03:12.221
Oh...

03:12.692 --> 03:13.522
Oops.

03:14.627 --> 03:18.290
Wow. Look at all this stuff.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.733
You were so cute
before you could talk back.

03:24.571 --> 03:26.766
Your bath buddy.

03:29.108 --> 03:32.407
And my bodyguard.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.974
Cool.
This is from the Stampede.

03:36.115 --> 03:41.382
This was the last year we went.
The year dad had his accident.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.086
Lou! Look at this!

03:46.626 --> 03:50.062
"Marion, I know I've done
some terrible things.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.790
Please find it in your heart
to forgive me.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.990
All I want is for us
to be a family again.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.961
Tell the girls I love them,
and I miss them.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.601
I never stopped loving you.
Tim."

04:02.809 --> 04:04.208
Dad wrote that?

04:04.310 --> 04:05.709
It's from Fort St. John.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.412
That was seven years ago.

04:10.216 --> 04:12.377
I don't get it.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.386
Mom always said dad walked away,
and he never looked back.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.237
# And at the break of day #

04:36.342 --> 04:40.438
# You sank into your dream #

04:40.780 --> 04:43.647
# You dreamer #

04:44.684 --> 04:47.084
# You dreamer #

04:48.955 --> 04:54.052
# You dreamer #

05:05.338 --> 05:08.330
That's it. Bend your elbows.

05:08.441 --> 05:10.306
Don't pull on his mouth, all right?

05:11.110 --> 05:13.510
What's with the helmet?
I mean, a motorcycle, I get it.

05:13.613 --> 05:14.978
But this is a pony.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.676
Tell him, Amy.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.275
Everybody has to wear a helmet
when they're learning.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.685
Well, I think I'm wearing it
on the wrong part of my body.

05:23.823 --> 05:24.881
I don't care how many helmets
you wear,

05:24.991 --> 05:27.459
as long as one of them's
on your head.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.993
[Car approaches]

05:42.342 --> 05:44.037
Well, that's the first
I've heard of it.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.371
It doesn't surprise you?

05:45.478 --> 05:47.878
That dad wanted to get back together
with mom?

05:47.980 --> 05:48.969
Just words on a page.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.982
Aw, come on, Grandpa.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.518
It's easy to write a letter.

05:53.619 --> 05:56.520
A lot harder to show up
and raise your kids.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.020
Whoa! Look at this rig!

06:04.397 --> 06:05.557
Hey, Ben.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.858
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Lou.

06:06.999 --> 06:07.658
Hey.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.064
Your aunt's told me all about you.

06:10.703 --> 06:16.733
This is Amy, my sister.
And, uh, this is Mallory. She's our...

06:17.443 --> 06:19.911
Riding instructor.

06:20.079 --> 06:20.841
Yeah.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.938
Uh, yeah, I've seen you
on the show circuit.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.572
Not lately, though.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.151
[Horse neighs]

06:27.286 --> 06:29.083
Sounds like your horse
wants to get out.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.212
TY: Hey!

06:30.723 --> 06:32.953
How do you stop this thing?

06:33.092 --> 06:34.286
Hey, who's the cowboy?

06:34.594 --> 06:37.085
My student. Beginner.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.198
Rank beginner.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.931
His name's Red.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.202
He's gorgeous.
What is he? Five, six?

06:51.310 --> 06:54.108
Yeah, he's six.
Aunt Lisa bought him for me.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.841
Must really suck, having an aunt
who owns a stable.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.577
Yeah, okay.
I guess it's pretty sweet.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.385
So, for the next couple of days,

07:01.487 --> 07:02.920
I'm gonna put some Valerian
in his feed,

07:03.022 --> 07:04.990
just to help him settle down.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.614
Nah, Red doesn't need drugs.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.785
Oh, Valerian's not a drug, it's one
of the herbal remedies we use here.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.454
It works really well
on a sensitive horse.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.498
What makes you think
Red's sensitive?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.191
I mean, you've never even
seen him before.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.428
Well, my mom taught me
how to read a horse's face.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.129
Okay.

07:20.673 --> 07:24.165
Look, his forehead's wide.
It means he's intelligent.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.974
And his almond-shaped eyes show

07:28.080 --> 07:29.707
that it's hard for him
to earn your trust.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.114
That's not bad.
Uh, not that far off, actually.

07:33.219 --> 07:37.087
You see these swirls here?
They show you how sensitive he is.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.357
He'll over-react
if you push him too hard.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.892
Punishing will just make it worse.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.587
Yeah, in a perfect world,
I wouldn't have to push him.

07:43.696 --> 07:46.187
But I got back to back meets
every weekend.

07:46.332 --> 07:50.200
And if you want to win,
you've gotta do what works.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.703
And you know what, Amy?
I want to win.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.945
What's the deal with the frat boy
and his fancy horse?

08:01.113 --> 08:05.072
According to Lou, Amy's supposed
to be teaching him what we do here.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.242
Well, while he's doing the learning,
he's going to be mucking out stalls?

08:08.354 --> 08:10.549
Paying us for the privilege.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.147
- That's a good deal for you.
- Well, you too, I'd say.

08:13.259 --> 08:15.659
You're always moanin'
that you've got too much work.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.062
I don't mind the work.
I'm just not sharing my room.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.790
And how you never get time off.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.631
Well, time off sounds okay.

08:22.735 --> 08:28.264
And how my conversational skills
leave something to be desired.

08:31.611 --> 08:35.604
Like I'm gonna catch something
if you keep doing that!

08:44.256 --> 08:47.556
I guess a new guy
might liven things up a bit.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.285
But still, I'm not sharing my room.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.955
Don't worry about it.
He's gonna be bunking in the house.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.760
Good.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.865
Hey, wait. I'm stuck in the barn
with the lousy horses,

08:57.970 --> 09:00.302
and this guy cruises in
and gets VIP treatment?

09:00.773 --> 09:05.472
You're the one who said
you didn't want to share.

09:13.819 --> 09:19.519
So, Ty, you work on a horse ranch?
You can't even ride a horse?

09:19.659 --> 09:21.820
Where I come from, the only guys
who ride horses are cops.

09:21.928 --> 09:26.228
At least he's not scared of horses,
like Lou.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.494
And, Amy,
you're not competing anymore?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.437
Well, with all the stuff there is
to do around here,

09:33.539 --> 09:35.530
it's kind of hard to find the time.

09:35.641 --> 09:39.975
Now that we've got an extra hand,
I expect you'll have more.

09:40.112 --> 09:40.976
You get Spartan back in the ring,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.809
that would be great publicity
for Heartland.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.112
Yeah, if I win.

09:45.217 --> 09:46.275
Oh, come on, Amy.

09:46.619 --> 09:50.350
Well, how do you prove you're good
at something if you don't compete?

09:50.456 --> 09:51.821
I've gotta do the night check
on the horses.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.453
I'll come with you.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.827
You know maybe you wanna go
with them, Ben?

09:59.966 --> 10:01.866
Lt'll be a good way
to get to the horses.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.265
Ah, you know what?
It's been a long day.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.133
I think I'm just gonna go chill
in my room.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.016
Dad...

10:38.037 --> 10:39.368
Dad?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.064
Yeah.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.342
Sorry to call so late.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.379
Look, there are a few things
I'd like to talk to you about.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.881
Can we get together?

10:52.118 --> 10:53.847
Uh...

10:54.520 --> 10:58.149
No. Uh, yeah, that's good.

10:58.257 --> 11:03.820
Okay. I'll see you then. Bye.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.303
Lou?

11:11.404 --> 11:11.961
Grandpa?

11:12.071 --> 11:13.060
[Laughing]

11:13.172 --> 11:16.664
Burning the midnight oil, Lou?

11:16.842 --> 11:18.469
Yeah.

11:18.911 --> 11:20.970
No. I...

11:21.080 --> 11:23.344
That was just Carl.

11:25.718 --> 11:29.711
I'm making a pot of tea.
You look like you could use a cup.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.756
Sure. Thanks.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.291
That must be tough.

11:36.395 --> 11:38.727
Trying to have some kind
of relationship with someone

11:38.831 --> 11:40.856
when you hardly
ever see each other.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.474
[Screams]

11:57.917 --> 11:58.906
Watch it!

11:59.051 --> 11:59.881
Sorry.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.146
- Do you run here every morning?
- I try to.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.484
'Cause I'm going to be hacking Red
on this trail

12:04.590 --> 12:05.784
about this time every day,

12:05.891 --> 12:07.950
so if you've got a problem
with horses,

12:08.094 --> 12:09.755
maybe you wanna find another route.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.428
Yah!

12:13.599 --> 12:15.123
Hey, buddy, I live here.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.431
You're just a guest...
...a paying guest.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.870
That's it.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.572
Eh, can somebody hose Red off?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.479
I've gotta grab something to eat
before we start jumping.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.484
Everybody's a little bit busy
right now, Ben.

12:34.353 --> 12:38.517
Oh, yeah? Like whatever you're doing
right now is totally important, right?

12:39.158 --> 12:42.525
What I'm doing is a form of therapy
called "t-touch".

12:42.628 --> 12:44.425
When Spartan first came here,
you could barely get near him.

12:44.530 --> 12:45.497
This just calms him down.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.691
I get it with a horse like this, uh,
he was in an accident. But Red...

12:49.902 --> 12:52.666
No. All horses can benefit.
Even a horse like Red.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.832
All Red needs right now
is a cold shower.

12:55.975 --> 12:59.035
Seriously, Ben. Your aunt wanted
you to learn what we do here.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.542
Yeah, well, the thing is,

13:00.646 --> 13:04.673
my training program doesn't include
a lot of time for "pony" massage.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.292
How's that Ben working out?

13:18.397 --> 13:19.261
[Laughing]

13:19.365 --> 13:21.731
Well, we're trying to give him
the benefit of the doubt.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.597
That good, eh?

13:23.702 --> 13:26.671
I'm hosing down his horse,
like I have nothing better to do.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.338
Well, Lou tells me it's a good way

13:29.441 --> 13:31.875
for the ranch to make
some extra income.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.340
Did she tell you about the letter?

13:36.782 --> 13:39.273
Yeah, she showed it to me.

13:44.790 --> 13:49.921
I just... I don't understand
why mom never told us about it.

13:50.029 --> 13:54.830
When a man leaves his wife and kids,
in a few years when it suits him,

13:54.934 --> 13:58.028
he writes a letter
saying he wants them back...

13:58.137 --> 14:00.833
There's a lot of water
under that bridge.

14:00.940 --> 14:06.207
But what if it was true, Grandpa?
We could have been a family again.

14:06.478 --> 14:12.280
That's the thing, Amy.
We are a family.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.389
Come on, Red.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.499
- BEN: Come on.
- It's positively medieval.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.764
What does he think he's doing?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.700
He's trying to stop Red
from rushing his fences.

14:36.141 --> 14:38.109
- By ripping his teeth out?
- BEN: Come on, Red.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.008
That's the medieval part.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.945
BEN: Come on.

14:46.552 --> 14:46.984
Hey! What the hell?

14:47.086 --> 14:48.576
How about you give
the horse a break, okay?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.487
How about you mind
your own business?

14:53.592 --> 14:55.617
I work here.
That makes it my business.

14:56.462 --> 15:01.297
Oh, yeah? The guy who can't
even ride, giving me advice.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.960
Get out of my way, ranch hand...

15:04.436 --> 15:06.336
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:07.673 --> 15:08.765
Whoa!

15:08.874 --> 15:12.139
If you guys are gonna go at it,
at least let me hold your horse.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.544
Yeah, sure. You can cool him off
and wrap his legs too.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.747
He's right.
I don't know much about horses.

15:20.853 --> 15:24.687
But I know an arrogant ass...
- jerk when I see one.

15:24.790 --> 15:28.089
An arrogant ass-jerk.
Couldn't have said it better myself.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.373
I found this.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.747
Marion kept this.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.151
I didn't know if she ever got it.

15:54.987 --> 15:57.012
She didn't write you back?

15:57.156 --> 15:59.056
No.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.856
I was like a bad habit
she was determined to break.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.797
"All I want is for us to be
a family again."

16:07.900 --> 16:09.891
So why did you write that
if you didn't even mean it?

16:10.035 --> 16:11.024
I meant every word of it.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.125
Oh, really?

16:12.271 --> 16:13.863
Just like you said you were
gonna come to the Open House,

16:13.973 --> 16:14.997
and didn't even bother to show up?

16:15.107 --> 16:16.540
I was there, Lou.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.672
I was there.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.180
I promised you.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.055
Jack didn't tell you?

16:30.990 --> 16:35.586
- He never said anything to me.
- He said plenty to me.

16:35.694 --> 16:36.422
Dad, wait.

16:39.465 --> 16:40.557
I'm tired of waiting, Lou.

16:43.869 --> 16:46.429
Saw Amy the other day
up at Beartooth Creek.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.903
She was riding a black horse.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.667
Looked like he had
a lot of thoroughbred in him.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.072
Spartan.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.143
What were you doing up there?

16:52.244 --> 16:55.680
Looking for strays, Big River Ranch.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.441
Big River?
Dad, we're practically neighbors.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.916
Yeah, I told you,
I wasn't planning on leaving town.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.353
And your grandfather
has no say in that.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.625
Atta boy.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.060
Come on. Shhh.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.333
BEN:
Come on, Red, pick it up!

17:17.502 --> 17:19.493
I don't even care
if he does any work.

17:19.605 --> 17:20.902
BEN:
Here we go, Red.

17:21.006 --> 17:24.339
It's the way he treats that horse.
You gotta say something to him.

17:24.443 --> 17:28.607
It's not that simple.
Red is Ben's horse.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.306
Heartland's your ranch.

17:30.449 --> 17:33.941
If it was up to me, I mean, I think
he's pushing Red too hard, but...

17:34.086 --> 17:36.247
I can't change the way
he does things overnight.

17:36.355 --> 17:38.949
Anyway, he's just here until his aunt
gets back from Europe.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.253
She must be paying you
a lot of money to look the other way.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.089
That's not fair.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.636
Hot ash?

17:51.770 --> 17:53.237
More like pain in the ash.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.898
BEN: Come on, Red!
Pick it up.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.172
The great thing about this place,

17:58.277 --> 18:00.142
you can really feel
the positive energy

18:00.245 --> 18:02.076
as soon as you drive
through the gate.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.173
So, Amy, I heard the rumor
that Ben Stillman was working here.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.478
So I had to check it out for myself.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.712
Yeah, working?
Don't believe that.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.847
Well, I guess your days
are numbered. I mean, really.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.925
How much staff
can the poverty barn afford?

18:14.026 --> 18:16.426
Is this a social visit, Ashley?
'Cause we've got work to do.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.520
Relax, Amy.
I'm just here to say hi to Ben.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.659
By the way, Ty. We're looking
for a new groom at Briar Ridge.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.500
Oh, I'll send you my resume.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.901
Seriously, Ty.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.531
He's got a lot of work to do here.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.405
I'm talking about a real job.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.603
Yeah, well, forget it.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.873
Working at Heartland
is a condition of his probation.

18:37.216 --> 18:37.739
What...?

18:40.719 --> 18:43.085
Unbelievable!

18:43.188 --> 18:48.091
Probation? Really? What did he do?

18:49.061 --> 18:52.895
So I'll get my mom
to give you a shout!

18:52.998 --> 18:55.364
Hey, Ben!

18:56.735 --> 18:58.362
Ty!

18:58.770 --> 19:01.068
Look, I'm sorry.

19:02.374 --> 19:03.841
It's no big.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.376
No. I should've never said that.

19:07.246 --> 19:12.377
It's just Ashley.
She makes me insane.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.985
Maybe I'll take her up on her offer.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.078
A real job, must mean real money,
right?

19:17.222 --> 19:20.521
You mean, you'd actually work
at Briar Ridge?

19:21.293 --> 19:25.821
Why not? You say you do things
differently around here.

19:25.931 --> 19:29.890
But from the way I see it,
Briar Ridge, Heartland,

19:30.002 --> 19:31.799
it's all about the money.

19:31.904 --> 19:34.896
So what's the big deal
where I end up working?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.246
Thought I told you, you weren't
welcome on my property.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.756
Yeah, well, I almost listened to you

19:53.859 --> 19:57.056
till I found out you didn't tell Lou
about the Open House.

19:57.629 --> 19:59.961
I made a promise to my daughter,
Jack, and I kept it.

20:00.499 --> 20:04.435
Well, I guess there's a first time
for everything.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.004
As far as you're concerned,
I'm always the bad guy, huh?

20:07.139 --> 20:09.073
You make your bed, you lie in it.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.144
I bet you've been painting quite
the picture of me all these years.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.440
I did what was right for those girls.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.311
And my daughter. I told them
what they needed to hear.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.817
They need to hear the truth.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.944
They have a right to know
what really happened.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.245
What makes you think they don't?

20:25.390 --> 20:28.382
'Cause I know you!

20:30.162 --> 20:32.130
You had your chance to be a father.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.960
That was the past, Jack.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.331
Those girls are gonna be
a part of my future.

20:37.436 --> 20:40.166
Nothing you can do about that.

20:46.945 --> 20:50.642
Hey, Ben, I'm thinking of taking
Spartan out for a trail ride.

20:50.749 --> 20:51.272
Do you wanna come?

20:51.383 --> 20:54.614
Ehh, trail rides
are kinda a waste of time.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.518
I find they're good,
especially when you're training.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.183
Just lets them be horses for a while.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.528
He's really relaxed on the trail.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.569
Yeah, he's an amazing horse.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.639
My aunt bought him for me
as an unbroken 3-year-old.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.504
I mean, it was after my parents
got divorced.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.043
Is that why you went to live
with your aunt?

21:20.145 --> 21:22.136
Yeah, sort of.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.308
And the fact that I got kicked out
of the boarding school,

21:25.417 --> 21:26.884
they parked me in.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.317
It must have been rough.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.153
But at least you have
your aunt, though, right?

21:32.257 --> 21:36.489
Yeah. Until she dumped me
on you guys.

21:36.595 --> 21:38.187
Let's go this way.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.932
He doesn't mind the water?

21:46.438 --> 21:48.463
No, he loves it.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.007
[Horse neighs]

21:50.108 --> 21:51.700
Stop!

21:51.843 --> 21:53.276
Come on! Come on!

21:53.378 --> 21:54.436
Ben!

21:55.981 --> 21:58.677
Ben, he's just afraid!

21:58.817 --> 21:59.875
Ben, stop!

21:59.985 --> 22:01.043
Come on, Red!

22:02.754 --> 22:03.550
Come on.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.248
He has to learn!

22:05.624 --> 22:07.819
Ben, he's just afraid!

22:07.926 --> 22:08.415
Come on!

22:09.227 --> 22:10.159
Come on!

22:11.863 --> 22:13.728
Come on!

22:15.133 --> 22:19.763
See? All you have to do
is show him who's boss.

22:20.539 --> 22:23.133
Come on, I'll race you back.

22:30.582 --> 22:32.243
How much is Lisa Stillman
paying us?

22:32.384 --> 22:34.545
- What are you talking about?
- I want him out of here!

22:34.653 --> 22:36.587
Oh, come on, Amy.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.020
He doesn't do any work. He doesn't
even believe in what we do!

22:39.124 --> 22:40.386
And I hate the way he treats Red.

22:40.492 --> 22:41.925
Okay, listen to me.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.722
I tore up my Ben Stillman
fan club card

22:43.829 --> 22:46.059
the day he tried to run me over
with his horse.

22:46.164 --> 22:48.064
But the truth is,
he has nowhere else to go.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.937
I don't care. And it's not even
just about the horse.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.233
There's a job at Briar Ridge,
and you know what?

22:55.340 --> 22:59.174
Ty's gonna take it
if we don't get rid of Ben.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.290
What's going on?
No one's said a word.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.263
You know, Mallory,

23:20.365 --> 23:23.994
not everybody feels the need
for constant communication.

23:24.436 --> 23:28.202
Or any communication.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.940
[Phone rings]

23:32.043 --> 23:32.873
I'll get it.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.680
Hello?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.483
Well, good evening to you too.

23:43.855 --> 23:47.985
Yeah. Yeah, he's sitting right here.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.924
It's for you.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.262
It's Val Stanton.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.266
Hello?

24:10.148 --> 24:14.050
Hey, stable boy.
Forgot to muck out Red's stall.

24:14.152 --> 24:17.417
I didn't forget.
It's your stall, you muck it out.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.514
Shoveling manure might seem
like a dream job to you,

24:20.625 --> 24:22.286
but I have other aspirations.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.235
Maybe I've got other aspirations too.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.702
Where are you going?

24:40.979 --> 24:42.412
I did my morning chores.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.074
Except for one stall.

24:45.183 --> 24:47.447
Look, I know he can be a total jerk,
and I hate the way he treats Red,

24:47.552 --> 24:49.315
but Lou says he doesn't
even have a real home.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.150
Not since his parents split up.

24:51.256 --> 24:56.523
And his aunt doesn't want him
anymore. All he's got is Red.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.226
Wow. I've heard a lot of sob stories.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.799
But that one, when you got
to the part about the rich kid

25:01.900 --> 25:03.094
who only has his horse...

25:27.659 --> 25:29.456
Eh! Hey! What are you doing?!

25:39.437 --> 25:40.028
Come on, Red.

25:45.477 --> 25:45.966
Hey!

25:49.614 --> 25:52.879
Ben! Ben!

25:53.718 --> 25:56.687
Amy! Come quick! It's Ben!

26:00.325 --> 26:03.260
Ben! Ben! Just don't get up.
Just, just breathe.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.767
I don't know what got into him.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.335
He was heading straight for the...

26:13.538 --> 26:16.336
Well, where is he?

26:16.608 --> 26:18.200
Where is Red?

26:33.058 --> 26:34.389
What a surprise!

26:36.227 --> 26:37.990
I've got an appointment
with your mom.

26:38.129 --> 26:40.996
Oh, she had to leave. But I'm here.
Let me show you around.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.527
Um, maybe I should just come back.
It's about the job.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.831
I'm the one who told her about you.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.564
Did you tell her the part
about the probation?

26:48.940 --> 26:50.168
Not a problem.

26:51.109 --> 26:51.734
Just like that?

26:52.344 --> 26:55.074
Just like that.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.012
We have stables for 60 horses.

26:59.117 --> 27:04.384
Two full-time trainers, ten grooms,
and a couple stable hands.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.348
Starting pay is at least twice

27:06.458 --> 27:08.358
what you're making
at the poverty barn.

27:08.460 --> 27:14.296
And I could show you how to ride.
After that, who knows?

27:14.399 --> 27:17.391
Sounds good. But why me?

27:17.502 --> 27:19.493
Hmmm, the Flemings
aren't the only ones

27:19.604 --> 27:21.037
willing to give someone
a second chance.

27:21.139 --> 27:22.299
Yeah, right.

27:22.407 --> 27:25.740
You think you have some
big future there? Trust me.

27:26.177 --> 27:29.943
I happen to know that you're
on your way out. Ben told me.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.016
I mean, why else do you think
he's there?

27:32.117 --> 27:34.711
He's only staying a couple of weeks
till his aunt gets back.

27:34.819 --> 27:35.751
You don't get it.

27:36.087 --> 27:38.612
Lisa Stillman has a house
in the South of France.

27:38.723 --> 27:44.559
She goes there for months at a time.
Who knows when she'll be back?

27:45.363 --> 27:47.024
Let me show you
where you'll be staying.

27:56.241 --> 27:57.606
All right, we'll split up
and head towards the highway.

27:57.709 --> 27:58.573
Ben, you take the ridge,

27:58.677 --> 27:59.541
and Mallory and I
we'll go through the woods.

27:59.644 --> 28:02.238
If you find him first, you call me.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.937
Is Ty really gonna take that job
at Briar Ridge?

28:33.011 --> 28:34.501
You like him, don't you?

28:34.612 --> 28:38.878
No way! Why?
Did he say anything?

28:38.983 --> 28:40.143
Did he?

28:40.251 --> 28:42.082
Shhh! Shut up, Mallory.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.449
Oh, my God,
he did say something!

28:43.555 --> 28:47.855
No. Shhh. Look. There's Red.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.227
Easy, boy.

28:58.303 --> 29:02.501
Good boy. Good boy.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.665
I don't get it.
He seems totally chill.

29:04.776 --> 29:08.507
The only problem with this horse
is Ben.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.945
You know, I almost hate
to take him back.

29:14.953 --> 29:20.516
Ben? Yeah, we've got him.
He's up near Beartooth Creek.

29:26.397 --> 29:28.991
That's a good boy.

29:35.907 --> 29:38.740
It's mighty quiet around here.

29:40.311 --> 29:45.578
Everybody's out looking
for Ben's horse. He took off.

29:45.683 --> 29:48.015
Can't say as I blame him.

29:49.821 --> 29:54.349
Or maybe somebody told him to get
lost and didn't bother to mention it.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.826
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

29:59.264 --> 30:03.860
Oh? Really? And when was all this
talking going to take place?

30:03.968 --> 30:06.903
I was waiting for the right time,
I guess.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.871
The right time to tell me
that dad was at the Open House,

30:09.974 --> 30:13.410
and you threw him off?

30:13.912 --> 30:15.379
Why would you do that, Grandpa?

30:16.748 --> 30:18.443
I invited him.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.916
Lou, you're a grown woman.

30:21.019 --> 30:23.817
And you can see him if you want.

30:23.922 --> 30:27.119
But Amy... Amy's still a child.

30:27.258 --> 30:33.527
Amy... Amy does exactly the same
work on this ranch that mom did.

30:33.631 --> 30:36.691
She works with the horses.
She deals with the clients.

30:36.801 --> 30:38.428
She even runs the hired hands.

30:38.536 --> 30:42.836
And in your mind,
she is still a child?

30:56.321 --> 31:00.382
Let's not go this way.
Red's afraid of the water.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.959
Come on, Amy.
He's gonna be fine with you.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.927
Easy, boy. It's okay. Easy.

31:16.474 --> 31:16.940
Oh, my God!

31:17.075 --> 31:18.702
Amy!

31:18.910 --> 31:19.808
Ahh!

31:20.111 --> 31:23.569
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy!
Easy! Easy!

31:38.029 --> 31:39.291
Mallory, what are you doing?

31:39.397 --> 31:42.195
You know you're not allowed
to ride your horse in the barn.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.927
It's Amy!
Red knocked her off her horse!

31:44.068 --> 31:45.831
What do you mean?
Is she okay?

31:45.970 --> 31:48.200
I don't know! My horse took off!
I couldn't pull him up!

31:48.306 --> 31:48.795
Where is she?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.239
Beartooth Creek,
near the crossing.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.874
I know better than to scream
around horses, it wasn't a big scream,

31:54.979 --> 31:56.207
it was more like a cry for help.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.781
Not now, Mallory.

31:57.882 --> 32:00.851
Okay, maybe I panicked
and went a little insane, and, yeah,

32:00.952 --> 32:01.919
maybe I even screamed.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.317
Grandpa, what's wrong?

32:03.521 --> 32:05.318
It's Amy! She's hurt!

32:50.301 --> 32:51.859
Hey.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.998
You're a long way from home.

33:04.882 --> 33:07.578
If you think I'm gonna walk you back,
you got another thing coming,

33:07.685 --> 33:09.175
all right?

33:35.179 --> 33:36.976
Agh!

33:47.291 --> 33:47.620
Agh!

33:48.159 --> 33:49.217
Agh!

34:27.031 --> 34:28.793
Jack!

34:29.600 --> 34:30.793
Amy!

34:30.935 --> 34:32.333
She's upstream!

34:32.437 --> 34:33.927
Lou!

34:39.811 --> 34:40.469
Amy!

34:43.947 --> 34:45.745
Amy...

34:47.018 --> 34:48.610
Grandpa...

34:48.753 --> 34:49.913
I got you, honey.

34:54.192 --> 34:55.556
You fell off your horse.

34:55.659 --> 34:58.060
We're taking you to the hospital,
okay?

35:21.052 --> 35:23.145
Hey, where's Red?

35:23.354 --> 35:27.381
There's been an accident.
Amy's hurt. Jack just called.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.720
What about my horse?

35:28.860 --> 35:30.293
Didn't you hear what I just said?
Amy's hurt.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.861
They're taking her to the hospital.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.263
Is she okay?

35:34.398 --> 35:39.028
Jack thinks so.
They just want to make sure.

35:39.504 --> 35:42.530
Hey! Somebody lose a horse?

35:42.640 --> 35:45.040
Those riding lessons you gave me
paid off.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.175
I didn't want to push
my luck, though.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.804
Yeah, I found him back there,
just standing by the road.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.054
What's wrong?

36:08.032 --> 36:10.296
How's Amy?

36:15.306 --> 36:19.572
They gave her some tests,
but it looks good.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.701
And Lou's with her, so...

36:21.512 --> 36:23.275
Well, it's not my fault.

36:23.548 --> 36:24.947
Nobody's saying it is.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.677
I'm not an idiot, Ty. I know
what you guys think about me.

36:28.452 --> 36:31.012
That I train my horse too hard.

36:31.422 --> 36:34.619
There's gotta be some reason
why Red ran away.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.158
Yeah, something like that.

36:36.260 --> 36:40.424
Yeah, well, you don't know horses,
Ty, so you can't understand.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.990
Red's important to me.

36:43.501 --> 36:46.937
Then maybe you should treat him
like he is.

36:47.338 --> 36:48.270
Look at this.

36:50.675 --> 36:52.233
That's from the bush.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.469
You're so full of it, man.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.775
Okay. That's how you train a horse.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.246
You know what?
You are an idiot.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.009
You know exactly
what you've been doing wrong,

37:00.117 --> 37:02.677
I've heard Amy tell you
a thousand times,

37:02.787 --> 37:04.414
but you keep doing it.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.956
Because what?

37:07.091 --> 37:11.460
Huh? You got some personal issues
you gotta work out with your horse?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.258
Man, I never even wanted
to come here in the first place.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.695
I didn't have a choice.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.422
How did Spartan get here?

37:41.259 --> 37:43.352
Dad brought him back.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.761
I've been meaning to tell you, he...

37:48.866 --> 37:52.529
He's been working up
at Big River Ranch.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.498
How long?

37:58.075 --> 37:59.633
Since mom died.

38:00.811 --> 38:02.938
Wow.

38:03.314 --> 38:05.441
You're really good
at keeping secrets.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.128
Amy, be fair.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.696
Every time I mentioned dad to you,

38:19.797 --> 38:21.992
you made it perfectly clear
you didn't want to see him.

38:22.099 --> 38:23.589
How am I supposed
to know what I want?

38:23.701 --> 38:27.535
You left out the part about him
being in town!

38:28.939 --> 38:32.534
Lou's not the only one who left out
some pertinent details.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.077
What are you talking about,
Grandpa?

38:35.246 --> 38:36.770
He's just trying to figure out
how to tell you

38:36.881 --> 38:38.508
that dad came to see us
at the Open House,

38:38.616 --> 38:39.844
but he booted him out.

38:42.019 --> 38:43.782
What?

38:45.289 --> 38:50.090
Yeah, wasn't exactly the first time.

38:51.595 --> 38:55.861
See, that letter, I, uh...

38:58.302 --> 39:00.429
Grandpa?

39:07.578 --> 39:09.512
After your dad got out
of the hospital,

39:09.613 --> 39:12.104
he was taking a lot of pills,
pain killers.

39:14.552 --> 39:17.521
Found they went down easier
with a little whisky.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.282
One night, things got heated.

39:19.390 --> 39:24.623
Words were said, words I didn't
think you girls should ever hear.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.893
So I suggested he pack up
and get the hell out.

39:28.999 --> 39:30.261
What about mom?

39:32.303 --> 39:34.066
Things were just going
from bad to worse.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.638
So she was glad to see him go.

39:37.408 --> 39:39.137
And he never came back?

39:39.377 --> 39:41.902
He wanted to.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.643
But your mother, she...

39:46.083 --> 39:48.984
Even after he got himself
cleaned up,

39:51.522 --> 39:55.049
she couldn't get herself to trust him.

39:56.494 --> 40:01.261
He broke my little girl's heart, Lou.
Into a million pieces.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.601
Why didn't you tell us this before?

40:09.106 --> 40:11.301
Tell you your daddy's a drug addict

40:11.409 --> 40:14.173
who can't keep his temper
under control?

40:15.446 --> 40:16.538
I just...

40:16.647 --> 40:18.877
I was trying.

40:22.219 --> 40:24.483
Your mother and I,
we were both, we...

40:24.588 --> 40:28.854
just trying to protect you girls.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.530
Hey, Jack.

40:35.933 --> 40:40.632
I was wondering, uh, I need you
to call my probation officer.

40:42.039 --> 40:44.405
You want to hand me
some milk there?

40:52.983 --> 40:54.211
You in some kind of trouble?

40:56.720 --> 40:58.984
I'm thinking about working
at Briar Ridge.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.559
This about that Ben Stillman fella?

41:04.094 --> 41:05.925
No.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.694
Working conditions
aren't up to scratch?

41:11.268 --> 41:13.828
Work's okay... Just...

41:15.439 --> 41:18.033
Briar Ridge, huh?

41:20.978 --> 41:22.002
That's a big decision.

41:22.112 --> 41:24.137
Ty, you might want
to think about that.

41:30.688 --> 41:31.552
AMY:
Great.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.752
And when were you gonna tell me?

41:34.358 --> 41:35.325
Amy, just listen.

41:35.426 --> 41:39.021
You know what? The sooner
you get out of here, the better!

42:02.686 --> 42:04.085
[Knock at the door]

42:07.224 --> 42:12.025
Um, Amy... It's about Red.

42:13.764 --> 42:17.791
All right, look,
I know I should've listened to you.

42:17.902 --> 42:19.927
And I just hope it isn't too late.

42:20.037 --> 42:22.835
Horses will forgive you
for practically anything.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.431
If you work at it.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.067
And what about you?

42:28.546 --> 42:32.778
Amy, please.
Look, I really need your help.

42:32.883 --> 42:37.980
The thing with Red,
and his fear of water,

42:38.088 --> 42:41.023
look, I know that's my fault.

42:41.125 --> 42:45.289
But I don't know how to fix it.

42:45.729 --> 42:51.395
Okay. I'll help you fix Red,
but as for me...

42:51.835 --> 42:54.861
Like I said,
you're gonna have to work at that.

42:54.972 --> 42:55.939
Yeah. Okay.

43:06.383 --> 43:10.080
Your doctor said to take it easy
with the riding for a couple of days.

43:10.788 --> 43:14.189
Yeah, well, people have been
telling me a lot of things lately.

43:16.427 --> 43:20.955
You know, you should have
told me about dad, Grandpa.

43:21.065 --> 43:24.057
It's not your job to protect me.
He's my father.

43:24.168 --> 43:25.658
I've got a right to make up
my own mind.

43:26.570 --> 43:30.233
Lou said I should stop
treating you like a child.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.208
She said that?

43:38.515 --> 43:42.952
It's hard to change the way
you think about someone, Amy.

43:43.053 --> 43:47.786
Especially someone you love.

43:48.425 --> 43:52.794
But maybe now
it's time that I did that.

43:53.530 --> 43:56.556
Yeah, maybe.

44:23.594 --> 44:24.891
[Horse snorts]

44:37.307 --> 44:38.239
