01:03.959 --> 01:05.667
( elevator dings )

01:08.333 --> 01:09.667
( panting )

01:09.667 --> 01:11.583
I'm here to see
David Pressler-Goings.

01:11.583 --> 01:13.625
He's not in yet.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.458
Oh. Okay, good.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.291
I thought
I was late.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.667
You are.
He's just not in yet.

01:19.667 --> 01:24.333
Okay, well, I'm
just gonna have a seat
in the reception area.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.250
Mm.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.333
Woman: What?

01:32.333 --> 01:36.667
( people whispering,
gasping )

01:36.667 --> 01:38.500
Look, I've got him
on the phone for you now.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.333
- Okay?
- Oh, okay.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.583
( phones ringing )

01:41.583 --> 01:43.125
Man:
Wait, what?

01:44.750 --> 01:46.333
- ( whispers )
- Okay.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.500
- Millstreet. No, I just
heard that myself.
- ( sobbing )

01:49.500 --> 01:51.792
Nobody here knows
much of anything yet.

01:51.792 --> 01:52.917
I'll call you back.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.083
- Woman: What did you say?
- ( phone rings )

01:55.083 --> 01:57.000
Oh.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.041
Millstreet.

01:58.041 --> 01:59.792
Yeah, but that's
all I know right now.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.250
That's all
any of us know.

02:01.250 --> 02:03.500
I'm trying to find out.
I'll call you back.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.583
( slams phone )

02:06.750 --> 02:08.250
Excuse me?

02:08.250 --> 02:11.959
- I was just wondering--
- I can't-- not now.
I just-- not now.

02:11.959 --> 02:14.000
Yeah, I just wanted
to know if it was safe

02:14.000 --> 02:16.291
- to be on this floor
of the building.
- ( phone rings )

02:16.291 --> 02:18.959
Millstreet.
No.

02:18.959 --> 02:20.417
No, not yet.

02:20.417 --> 02:23.291
- ( elevator dings )
- Receptionist: Well,
that's all I know.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.708
Well, I don't know yet.
If I don't know--

02:24.708 --> 02:27.375
- Morning, Louise.
- ( Louise sighs )
I'll call you back.

02:27.375 --> 02:31.667
- Hi, Stacia.
- Louise, are you all right?

02:31.667 --> 02:33.125
David is dead.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.333
- Stacia: Oh, my God.
- Louise: Oh, my God.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.000
- ( phones continue ringing )
- Louise: Millstreet.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.041
( grunts )

03:03.041 --> 03:05.250
And no one explains
what's happening,

03:05.250 --> 03:06.625
and then they say
he's dead.

03:06.625 --> 03:09.708
Yeah. Hannah,
it's something
that happens.

03:09.708 --> 03:12.583
It's like jury duty
or, you know, floods.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.417
- They happen.
- It's just so insane.

03:14.417 --> 03:17.750
We had a meeting,
and then he had to
reschedule the meeting

03:17.750 --> 03:18.917
'cause he was dead.

03:18.917 --> 03:19.959
Yeah, he's dead.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.625
And that's why
he couldn't come.

03:21.625 --> 03:25.417
It must've been so heavy
that moment that it was
all going down.

03:25.417 --> 03:26.583
Think about that.

03:26.583 --> 03:29.500
I just hope when I die
that I don't see it coming.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.750
I hope I'm already dead,
and then five minutes later,

03:31.750 --> 03:34.125
I'm like, "What the fuck
just happened?"

03:34.125 --> 03:37.458
You know,
I kind of look forward
to the day that I die.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.250
You do not.
Get real.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.792
I do.
If you think about it,
time isn't linear.

03:42.792 --> 03:46.125
Every moment that's
ever happened or that
will ever happen

03:46.125 --> 03:47.458
is happening right now.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.458
We just choose
to live in this moment

03:49.458 --> 03:51.625
to create some illusion
of continuity.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.041
So, really,
we have already died

03:54.041 --> 03:56.792
and we've also
not yet been born.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.750
Well, okay, in my
linear conception
of time,

04:00.750 --> 04:02.458
- I wonder what's--
- ( door opens )

04:02.458 --> 04:05.250
Holy fucking shit,
look what I just found.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.291
Oh, my God.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.792
Is that a picture
of Tom Hanks?

04:07.792 --> 04:09.417
- Yeah.
- I don't want it.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.625
- I'll take it.
- Oh, hey, Jessa.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.250
How's your life of doing
absolutely fucking nothing?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.417
Oh, it's great.
How's your penis?

04:14.417 --> 04:16.458
Good.
You want me to put it
on your shoulder?

04:16.458 --> 04:17.959
( laughs )

04:17.959 --> 04:19.750
David's dead.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.041
Who's David?

04:21.041 --> 04:24.166
My editor, David.
He's dead.

04:24.166 --> 04:27.708
Fuck, Hannah, baby.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.291
That sucks shit.

04:29.291 --> 04:31.125
Yeah, he's dead.

04:31.125 --> 04:33.667
It was so crazy.
Everyone was just
running around the office

04:33.667 --> 04:35.208
and freaking out
and screaming

04:35.208 --> 04:37.250
and acting like
their world had gone
out of orbit and--

04:37.250 --> 04:38.417
( groans )

04:38.417 --> 04:40.500
It's like everyone comes in
thinking it's a normal day

04:40.500 --> 04:44.083
and then they leave
'cause he's dead.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.959
What is a normal day,
though, really?

04:45.959 --> 04:47.250
What did you do?

04:47.250 --> 04:49.959
I mean, just amidst all that
chaos and insanity, I left.

04:49.959 --> 04:52.500
What else
was I supposed to do?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.166
( sighs )

04:54.166 --> 04:58.959
And no one
even began to tell me

04:58.959 --> 05:01.375
what was next
for my e-book.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.875
- What?
- I know.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.875
And so I'm left wondering
when and how and to whom

05:06.875 --> 05:08.875
I can even bring this up
to get some answers.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.959
Well, they probably
weren't thinking about
your book, Hannah,

05:10.959 --> 05:13.250
and I pretty much
can't believe you are
either.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.917
You knew someone.
Like, really knew him.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.875
He came to your
birthday party,
et cetera.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.875
He wasn't invited
to my birthday party.

05:19.875 --> 05:23.542
( moaning )

05:23.542 --> 05:24.875
What?

05:24.875 --> 05:29.708
I think Adam's feeling
is that you're callous
and disconnected.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.250
Are you feeling anything?

05:31.250 --> 05:32.500
Yes.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.000
Beyond wondering
when your book is
gonna hit the stands?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.166
It's an e-book, Adam.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.417
It's never gonna
hit the stands

05:37.417 --> 05:40.417
'cause there are no stands
and you know that.

05:40.417 --> 05:42.083
( sighs )

05:42.083 --> 05:44.250
- ( bell rings on recording )
- ( distant traffic blaring )

05:44.250 --> 05:45.583
Man on recording:
One thing we do know--

05:45.583 --> 05:48.959
life will give you whatever
experience is most helpful

05:48.959 --> 05:51.166
for the evolution
of your consciousness.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.500
How do you know
this is the experience
you need?

05:54.500 --> 05:59.333
Because this is the experience
you're having at this moment.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.708
From the interview...

06:00.708 --> 06:02.959
( whirrs )

06:02.959 --> 06:04.667
( pounding )

06:05.834 --> 06:07.083
Motherfucker.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.667
Okay, David's body
was found facedown
in the Hudson River

06:09.667 --> 06:11.583
right by Chelsea Piers,
just floating there.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.417
Well, that's
fucking terrible.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.792
And Gawker is reporting
that they won't be releasing

06:15.792 --> 06:18.375
the toxicology report at all,
so we're not gonna know if it--

06:18.375 --> 06:21.708
- Gawker?
- Yeah.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.458
You're getting
your news from Gawker?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.917
They report on media news
and I am a mediaist,

06:25.917 --> 06:28.166
so it's where
I've gotta get my news.

06:28.166 --> 06:31.625
Okay, when you die,
how would you feel

06:31.625 --> 06:33.375
if a bunch of
judgmental creeps,

06:33.375 --> 06:34.917
celibate
against their will,

06:34.917 --> 06:38.542
snarkily reported
on every fucking detail
of your body decomposing?

06:38.542 --> 06:39.917
Well, that's not
what's happening here.

06:39.917 --> 06:41.792
This is a very,
very nice eulogy.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.291
Listen.
"Goings, Goings, Gone--

06:43.291 --> 06:45.417
publishing's most
flamboyant power player

06:45.417 --> 06:48.625
makes a waterlogged exit
worthy of a Bret Easton
Ellis character."

06:48.625 --> 06:49.792
That's fucked, Hannah.

06:49.792 --> 06:50.917
Those are a bunch
of jealous people

06:50.917 --> 06:53.792
who make a living
appealing to our
basest desire

06:53.792 --> 06:55.417
to see each other kicked
while we're down.

06:55.417 --> 06:56.583
I don't agree, okay?

06:56.583 --> 06:59.834
It's a web portal
that celebrates
the written word.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.667
And its sister site,
Jezebel,

07:01.667 --> 07:04.375
is a place feminists
can go to support
one another,

07:04.375 --> 07:07.375
which we need
in this modern world
full of slut-shaming and--

07:07.375 --> 07:09.333
Well, I think that shit
gets into your head

07:09.333 --> 07:11.041
and makes you
one of the bad guys.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.625
I think that you need
a place to go

07:12.625 --> 07:15.500
and gather up
the information that's
important to your industry

07:15.500 --> 07:17.917
and then discuss it
with other like-minded
individuals.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.458
That's why the comments board
is so important to me

07:20.458 --> 07:22.500
and why I've made
so many e-friends.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.208
Why are we fighting
about this?

07:24.208 --> 07:26.542
Why aren't you
mourning quietly?

07:31.834 --> 07:33.583
Shoshanna:
I feel like my bandana
collection is, like,

07:33.583 --> 07:35.000
my most developed
collection.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.917
I mean, my array
of bandanas is insane.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.208
Did you ever have
a friend who died?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.041
Uh, yes, actually.
In high school,

07:43.041 --> 07:44.875
my friend Kelly
was in a car accident.

07:44.875 --> 07:47.083
Oh, that's awful.

07:47.083 --> 07:48.834
How did you feel?

07:48.834 --> 07:51.000
Mm, sad.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.458
But then I kind of, like,
took over her position
in the friend group.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.250
Like, we were always truly
meant to be a fivesome,
not a sixsome.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.792
The group didn't
really have room

07:57.792 --> 08:02.792
for, like, you know,
two practical-yet-goofy
confidants.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.208
I do miss her, though.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.750
Why? Do you know
someone who died?

08:05.750 --> 08:08.625
Yeah, actually.
My friend Season.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.625
She was
my favorite friend.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.917
She was so funny
and cute,

08:12.917 --> 08:16.917
and I used to
love her a lot.

08:16.917 --> 08:19.041
I just used to tickle her
all the time.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.792
You know, I don't even
have a picture of her.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.959
How did she die?

08:21.959 --> 08:25.291
Uh, she, like,
choked on vomit
or something.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.917
You should
visit her mom,

08:27.917 --> 08:30.333
or, like, her grave
if her mom is dead

08:30.333 --> 08:33.625
and bring flowers,
or, like, her Facebook
In Memoriam site.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.500
- Yeah, maybe.
- No, seriously.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.417
Like, you need to process this.
You need to grieve it out.

08:39.417 --> 08:42.082
Like, when Kelly died,
I wrote a book of poems
about her.

08:42.082 --> 08:44.333
Who's Kelly?

08:44.333 --> 08:46.875
My friend
in high school
who died.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.583
You had a friend
who died?

08:48.583 --> 08:51.583
We literally just had
this conversation.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.708
( snoring softly )

09:04.625 --> 09:05.917
Where are you headed?

09:05.917 --> 09:07.208
I'm gonna go work
an extra shift at Ray's.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.708
He's understaffed
anyway.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.375
It doesn't really
seem like I should
quit my day job.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.792
Don't talk like that.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.291
Well, what am I supposed
to talk like?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.291
No one will tell me
anything about my book.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.959
( groaning )

09:17.959 --> 09:21.708
Really, Adam?
Still too soon for you?

09:23.083 --> 09:27.250
Dude, cut me
a fucking break.
Why are you mad at me?

09:27.250 --> 09:29.166
I'm not mad.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.792
- I'm scared.
- You're scared?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.250
What are you scared of?

09:35.250 --> 09:39.959
Of how you'd act
if something, like,
real happened to us.

09:39.959 --> 09:44.000
Like, if I died,
would you just be like,
"Oh, I hope I can make rent."

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
If you died, I would be
extremely disoriented,

09:48.000 --> 09:49.417
extremely sad,

09:49.417 --> 09:52.333
and I would also
be anxious about how
I would make rent, yes.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.041
"Extremely sad"?

09:54.041 --> 09:56.625
Uh, yeah, if you died,
I'd be extremely sad.

09:56.625 --> 09:59.208
If you died,
the world would blur.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.792
I wouldn't know
what a tree was.

10:00.792 --> 10:03.667
Well, that's really nice.
It makes me feel very good.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.333
You know, I think
all the time about what
I'd say at your funeral,

10:06.333 --> 10:08.708
about how I'd say
that you were my partner
and you were my lover

10:08.708 --> 10:13.041
and how one summer
you lived in a tent
on a roof in Bed-Stuy

10:13.041 --> 10:15.166
and you drank rainwater.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.750
I don't know.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.875
I think about you dying
all the time.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.291
( whirring )

10:26.291 --> 10:28.417
( music playing )

10:28.417 --> 10:30.458
So, I lost
a friend yesterday.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.708
Close friend.

10:32.708 --> 10:35.667
Marnie finally decided
to throw in the towel?

10:35.667 --> 10:39.041
Uh, no, Ray, it was
my editor and collaborator,

10:39.041 --> 10:41.041
David Pressler-Goings.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.458
He was found facedown
in the Hudson River

10:43.458 --> 10:45.542
and Gawker is saying
it's not drugs,

10:45.542 --> 10:47.667
but we in the literary
community

10:47.667 --> 10:50.708
are left scratching
our heads.

10:50.708 --> 10:52.875
- Ray: Jesus.
- Thank you.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.291
Thanks.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.250
How do you feel?
Do you want to go home?

10:56.250 --> 10:59.041
( quietly )
You know, I actually
feel nothing.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.792
Like, I literally
feel nothing.

11:01.792 --> 11:04.250
Like, maybe I'm numb,
but I don't even feel numb.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.667
I feel nothing.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.917
But, yeah, I would
love to go home

11:07.917 --> 11:10.083
if that's okay
with you.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.583
Hannah, why don't you
place just one crumb

11:12.583 --> 11:13.959
of basic human compassion

11:13.959 --> 11:17.041
on this fat-free muffin
of sociopathic detachment?

11:17.041 --> 11:19.125
- See how it tastes.
- You sound like Adam.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.041
It's like there's more than
one way to feel something.

11:21.041 --> 11:26.041
Do you feel something
every single time someone
you kind of know dies?

11:26.041 --> 11:28.792
I don't know.
Why don't you try it
and we'll find out?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.542
Hannah, you don't think
it's slightly odd

11:31.542 --> 11:33.083
that I feel worse
than you do right now,

11:33.083 --> 11:34.834
and the one time
I met this dude,

11:34.834 --> 11:37.792
he hurled me across the room
into a small table?

11:39.291 --> 11:42.625
- ( music playing )
- Hey!

11:42.625 --> 11:44.291
It's Jessa.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.125
Yeah, I know,
it's been a very long time.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.875
I, um-- I--

11:50.875 --> 11:54.291
I know, I can't believe
I am still alive either.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.959
Um, so,
speaking of which,

11:56.959 --> 12:00.792
listen, I really
wanted to visit

12:00.792 --> 12:03.000
Season's tomb.

12:04.375 --> 12:08.542
Season,
her sarcophagus.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.667
Like, her grave.
Where--

12:12.959 --> 12:14.917
What do you mean?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.333
What?

12:21.375 --> 12:23.625
What?

12:26.375 --> 12:28.792
- Oh, hey, Laird.
- Hey, Hannah.

12:28.792 --> 12:32.542
Uh, you've-- you've
caught me spiffing.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.250
- Looks amazing.
- Thank you.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.542
I thought the halls
could use a little art.

12:36.542 --> 12:39.333
- How are you?
- Uh, I'm okay.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.750
I don't want to be
a total downer,

12:40.750 --> 12:43.208
but I lost
a close friend
yesterday.

12:44.917 --> 12:46.792
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.834
- That's okay, Laird.
- Very sorry.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.708
- Thank you.
- So sorry to hear that.
That's terrible.

12:54.708 --> 12:55.750
Thank you.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.333
I'm just--
I'm just sorry.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.583
- I really don't care.
- Okay.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.333
It's my first death,
so I'm kinda numbed.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.000
Yeah, I get it,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.834
and you're just gonna get
number when it all starts
to come like a waterfall.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.500
( sighs )

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
My whole life
has been death.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.792
Everyone around me
has died.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.291
Sometimes at dinner
when I'm sitting
at my table,

13:17.291 --> 13:21.667
I just imagine I am
in dialogue with all
my dead ones.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.291
Uh, who do you know
who's died?

13:26.291 --> 13:28.291
Literally everyone.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.708
Even this lady
has died.

13:30.708 --> 13:33.625
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm, it's my turtle.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.834
My turtle has died.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.708
And I didn't even think
that was possible.

13:37.708 --> 13:40.417
- I'm so sorry, Laird.
That's just--
- ( door closes )

13:40.417 --> 13:42.041
That's the fucking worst.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.875
Hey, Caroline.
Laird was just
showing me his--

13:44.875 --> 13:48.375
It's a turtle carcass.
It's my turtle carcass.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.875
Yeah.

13:49.875 --> 13:51.792
Wow, how totally
beautiful.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.375
Thank you.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.959
Hey, whatcha doing?

13:55.959 --> 13:57.917
Just heading out
for my afternoon
constitutional.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.333
- Cool.
- Come with me.
I'll buy you a cup of tea.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.959
Okay.

14:05.458 --> 14:08.458
Will you join us,
odd face?

14:08.458 --> 14:10.333
That'd be great.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.250
Uh, this is not
an urgent project,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.417
but it is something
I'd like to return to.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.792
Oh, and bring
your turtle, please.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.333
You know, I just don't
want to be considered
a monster

14:21.333 --> 14:23.875
for caring what happens
to my work.

14:23.875 --> 14:26.750
I've always been
incredibly invested
in my work

14:26.750 --> 14:28.083
and knew it would
be really hard

14:28.083 --> 14:29.583
for whatever man
ended up with me.

14:29.583 --> 14:32.500
- I feel that,
and I admire it.
- Thank you.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.583
I'm surprised you're not
quizzing me more about Adam,

14:34.583 --> 14:38.458
like all his old lovers
and what he was like
in the school play

14:38.458 --> 14:41.458
and what he used to call
his tiny little penis
as a child.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.542
Mine was
Nickel the Pickle.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.125
So, now are you gonna
call me self-involved,
too?

14:47.125 --> 14:48.792
'Cause I'm
ready for it.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.667
No, I'm gonna
call you secure.

14:51.667 --> 14:55.041
- Follow me.
- ( car horn honks )

15:10.083 --> 15:12.000
( doorbell buzzes )

15:15.458 --> 15:17.667
( footsteps approaching )

15:29.834 --> 15:32.417
Whose house is this?

15:33.375 --> 15:35.708
It's my house.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.750
What-- what the fuck
is going on?

15:38.750 --> 15:40.667
Open the door.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.875
( scoffs )

15:42.875 --> 15:45.500
I can't believe
you did this.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.041
I don't even know
how you did this.

15:48.041 --> 15:49.708
You had a funeral.

15:49.708 --> 15:52.041
You sent me
an invitation.

15:52.041 --> 15:53.959
Did you have
a fake funeral?

15:53.959 --> 15:55.834
We knew you wouldn't come.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.583
( baby fussing )

15:57.583 --> 15:58.875
( scoffs )

15:58.875 --> 16:01.834
I was a drug addict,
and you were a total enabler.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.542
That's bullshit,
Season.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.208
I told you
I needed counseling

16:05.208 --> 16:07.375
and you took me
to an ayahuasca ceremony.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.583
- Can I pick up your baby?
- No, you can't.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.500
I really missed you.

16:15.417 --> 16:17.834
I...

16:17.834 --> 16:19.792
- I know.
- Hey, honey.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.458
( baby cries )

16:23.875 --> 16:25.375
Oh.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.542
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.250
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.000
This is Jessa.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.083
- Jessa from--
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.125
- Do I have to pretend that--
- That she's dead?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.625
No, I kinda get
the sense she's alive.

16:43.625 --> 16:44.834
Okay, good,
'cause for a second

16:44.834 --> 16:47.000
I thought I had
to pretend that
she was a ghost,

16:47.000 --> 16:51.208
and I don't know
if I would have been
able to pull that off.

16:51.208 --> 16:52.375
Jessa: Ahem.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.291
I'm gonna grab
some OJ.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.500
It's nice
to meet you, Jessa.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.667
( baby fussing )

17:00.667 --> 17:02.417
Looks like you've
got it all figured out,

17:02.417 --> 17:05.290
with your brownstone
and your baby

17:05.290 --> 17:08.290
and your cool-looking
husband.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.791
Don't call me when
your life's in shambles.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.040
I won't.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.458
None of this
is gonna work out
for you, by the way.

17:18.583 --> 17:23.916
Here is your tricolore,
and here's your... thing.

17:23.916 --> 17:27.416
- Thanks,
can I just get a small--
- Yeah, one second.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.917
♪ What I am
is what I am ♪

17:29.917 --> 17:32.667

17:32.667 --> 17:35.500

17:35.500 --> 17:37.542

17:37.542 --> 17:41.041
- Look at that.
- Oh, it's so sad.

17:41.041 --> 17:42.291
Knock, knock.

17:42.291 --> 17:44.917
- Hey, Marn.
- ( music stops )

17:44.917 --> 17:48.417
What's up?
I was just showing Herm
your, uh, music.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.875
You were showing him
my music fail?

17:49.875 --> 17:52.375
- Is that what
you guys were doing?
- Hermie: I think it's great.

17:52.375 --> 17:55.542
You actually have a better
understanding of that song
than Edie Brickell did.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.500
- Oh, fuck you, Hermie.
- Ray: Hey, come on.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.458
Marnie:
Why would you show him
this video, Ray?

17:59.458 --> 18:02.625
Because it's a bold
and pioneering

18:02.625 --> 18:04.542
form of self-expression.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.834
Hermie:
Brickell sang it with,
like, a playful vibe,

18:06.834 --> 18:08.834
but it's actually
much more severe.

18:08.834 --> 18:12.208
It's about knowing...
what you are.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.875
Right, right.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.583
And about me
knowing what I am

18:15.583 --> 18:17.792
and asking if you are
what you are.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.041
Or what?

18:19.041 --> 18:20.708
That's so cute,
you two.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.083
That's not even
fucking original.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.750
You don't think
I've heard that
in the last couple weeks?

18:23.750 --> 18:25.708
- Marnie, come on.
- No, seriously.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.250
You think my life
is so funny.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.792
Like, "Oh, let's make fun
of the girl

18:28.792 --> 18:30.834
who took a risk
and put herself
out there creatively."

18:30.834 --> 18:33.625
Which, by the way, is not
something either of you
have to worry about

18:33.625 --> 18:36.166
because no one
wants to see you
and you can't do anything.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.500
Okay, Marnie,
maybe you should take
the rest of the day off.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.792
Maybe you  should take
the rest of the day off.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.500
Do you even want
to work here anymore?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.125
Of course I don't
want to work here.

18:44.125 --> 18:48.542
This place fucking sucks.
No one wants  to work here.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.291
Okay.

18:50.291 --> 18:52.500
All right, well, I guess
that settles it, then.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.708
- Great.
- Great.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.667
- Thank you.
- Fantastic. You're welcome.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.583
Consider this
a community service.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.542
I am so done.
Do you know what
kind of work

18:59.542 --> 19:01.458
I am qualified to do
out in the world?

19:01.458 --> 19:02.875
No idea whatsoever.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.208
- The kind
of people that want me?
- Why don't you clue us in?

19:05.208 --> 19:06.750
We don't have
the faintest clue.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.750
Fancy people
wanna work with me,

19:08.750 --> 19:11.875
so I'm gonna give them
that pleasure and I'm gonna
go work with them.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.708
So fuck you both,
have a nice day,

19:13.708 --> 19:15.291
enjoy the rest
of the video.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.542

19:17.542 --> 19:20.000
Wait! Marnie!

20:19.834 --> 20:22.500
You know, medication
did make me feel less.

20:23.458 --> 20:24.959
- It did?
- Yeah.

20:24.959 --> 20:27.458
See, that's really
not good for a writer.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.250
Yeah, but it's
really good for a person.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.166
It's too exhausting
feeling all that.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.625
I mean, God, I would
wake up happy,

20:34.625 --> 20:36.792
eat breakfast
despondent,

20:36.792 --> 20:39.000
wonder about eternity
on the walk to work,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.667
and then feel
comfortably numb
for hours.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.333
It's just too much,
the roller coaster
of it all.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.834
I wanted to die.

20:45.834 --> 20:47.208
See, when I was doing
so badly,

20:47.208 --> 20:48.500
I couldn't see
outside myself,

20:48.500 --> 20:51.625
and now I can,
but I don't even know
if it's any better

20:51.625 --> 20:53.750
'cause Adam's gonna figure out
what I'm actually like

20:53.750 --> 20:55.542
and there's no way
he's gonna like it

20:55.542 --> 20:57.458
because he has
such a depth of feeling,

20:57.458 --> 20:59.333
and no one can
even rival that.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.875
I definitely can't,

21:00.875 --> 21:03.458
and soon he's gonna
get bored and feel stifled

21:03.458 --> 21:05.041
by being with someone
who can't match

21:05.041 --> 21:07.417
his strength of emotion.

21:10.750 --> 21:14.166
Did Adam ever tell you
about Margaret?

21:14.166 --> 21:16.875
Mm-mm. Is she an ex?
'Cause I don't care
about that stuff.

21:16.875 --> 21:21.041
- I just don't even ask.
- No, she was our cousin.

21:21.959 --> 21:24.250
But she died
when she was 12.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.667
Muscular dystrophy.

21:26.667 --> 21:28.667
That's awful.
I'm so sorry.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.333
It was really awful,
but from the time she was
five years old,

21:32.333 --> 21:36.208
he started going over there
every single day,

21:36.208 --> 21:37.959
and he would sit there
in the living room

21:37.959 --> 21:41.208
next to her hospital bed
holding her hand,

21:41.208 --> 21:42.834
playing with her.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.208
He did anything
she asked.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.667
He would dance
like a princess for hours
if she wanted him to,

21:48.667 --> 21:52.000
which, you can imagine,
he was really good at that.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.375
But all she wanted to do,
really, before she died,

21:56.375 --> 21:59.208
was go to a real
high school dance,
you know?

21:59.208 --> 22:02.041
So, Adam,
his senior year,

22:02.041 --> 22:05.500
told his girlfriend
that he wasn't gonna
take her to the dance,

22:05.500 --> 22:08.375
and instead he went out
and he spent all of his savings

22:08.375 --> 22:10.708
from working
at the supermarket.

22:10.708 --> 22:15.000
He bought Margaret
this beautiful,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.500
teeny-tiny
little dress

22:17.500 --> 22:20.166
and he wheeled her
onto that dance floor,

22:20.166 --> 22:24.875
lifted her into his arms
for the final sweeping song.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.125
When she died
the following week,

22:27.125 --> 22:30.917
she was clutching
the wilted corsage

22:30.917 --> 22:33.583
he had given her
in one hand

22:33.583 --> 22:35.959
while holding his
in the other.

22:35.959 --> 22:39.083
- ( sobbing )
- That sucks.

22:39.083 --> 22:42.333
It's a rough one,
but I really thought
you should know.

22:42.333 --> 22:46.417
Wait, so was it a tiny dress
because she was, like, tiny
from the disease,

22:46.417 --> 22:47.708
or was it like a--

22:47.708 --> 22:49.291
Oh, my God.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.083
Oh, my God.
What?

22:51.083 --> 22:53.834
I just didn't know
if the disease had
made her really tiny.

22:53.834 --> 22:59.625
( laughs )
Oh, my God.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.166
You know what?
Now it makes sense

23:01.166 --> 23:02.625
why Adam's being
so irrational.

23:02.625 --> 23:03.792
This puts it all
into perspective.

23:03.792 --> 23:06.125
No, it doesn't,
because I made it up!

23:06.125 --> 23:07.333
What?

23:07.333 --> 23:09.458
- Yes, I made it up...
- What?

23:09.458 --> 23:11.625
...and you didn't
even shed a tear.

23:11.625 --> 23:14.959
Your little brow
didn't even furrow.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.583
That's so fucked up!

23:16.583 --> 23:19.500
- That is so fucked up!
- Are you serious?

23:19.500 --> 23:20.792
What is wrong with you?

23:20.792 --> 23:22.792
What's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.166
Oh, my God.
( laughing )

23:27.166 --> 23:30.333
It's cool, man.
I like you.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.959
( sniffles )

23:31.959 --> 23:34.834
Laird, it's fake.
It's not real.

23:34.834 --> 23:38.708
Just 'cause it's fake
doesn't mean I don't
feel it.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.708
( sniffles )

23:46.208 --> 23:49.875
- ( dog barks )
- ( child shouts )

24:12.834 --> 24:15.083
( birds chirping )

24:26.041 --> 24:28.333
Hey.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.917
Hey.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.041
I don't know how
you're feeling now,

24:47.041 --> 24:49.750
but I think that
I was just shocked...

24:51.667 --> 24:55.959
about how random,
uh, life can be...

24:57.542 --> 25:00.333
and how, um...

25:00.333 --> 25:05.375
one day you can just be
walking around talking,

25:05.375 --> 25:07.708
using your
gay phone app,

25:07.708 --> 25:10.083
and then the next,
you're, you know,
facedown in a river,

25:10.083 --> 25:12.500
and no one has a good
explanation for what--

25:14.083 --> 25:16.083
It always takes me
a little while

25:16.083 --> 25:18.250
to process my emotions.

25:21.959 --> 25:23.875
And I don't--

25:26.083 --> 25:29.667
( voice breaks )
I really liked David.

25:32.625 --> 25:35.250
I really felt
connected to him

25:35.250 --> 25:38.041
and very grateful
about how supportive
he had been with me,

25:38.041 --> 25:41.458
and it's just hard
to realize that my...

25:41.458 --> 25:45.625
champion... is gone.

25:48.417 --> 25:50.000
I feel like...

25:58.625 --> 26:01.500
I think I should
tell you about Margaret.

26:03.750 --> 26:07.041
She was my cousin,
and she died.

26:08.417 --> 26:12.667
When she was 12, I was 17,
she had muscular dystrophy,

26:12.667 --> 26:14.917
which she had always had
since she was born.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.333
( dog barking )

26:18.333 --> 26:19.625
We lived next door
to each other,

26:19.625 --> 26:22.166
so we spent a lot
of time together...

26:23.708 --> 26:26.250
just playing and talking.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.375
You know, everyone
always knew that she
was gonna die,

26:28.375 --> 26:30.834
and also she always knew
that she was gonna die,

26:30.834 --> 26:33.500
so, imagine living
your life that way

26:33.500 --> 26:36.583
from the time
that you're born.

26:36.583 --> 26:40.500
Knowing that you're not
gonna get to do anything

26:40.500 --> 26:44.792
that anybody else
gets to do.

26:44.792 --> 26:48.875
And all that she wanted
was to go to a senior prom.

26:50.166 --> 26:53.208
So I took her to mine.

26:53.208 --> 26:56.375
