00:07.920 --> 00:09.705
How can I help, Sheriff?

00:09.748 --> 00:12.360
We're trying to get ahold
of Rayberry's family,
if he had one.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.840
Was there any next of kin
that you know of?

00:14.884 --> 00:16.233
Shucks. I don't...

00:18.148 --> 00:21.543
Actually,
he might've had a wife.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.545
Do you know her name?
Or where she lived?

00:23.588 --> 00:26.113
No, no.
He was pretty tight-lipped
about his marriage.

00:26.156 --> 00:29.072
He only mentioned it
in passing.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.944
-Mm...
-But maybe he filled out
some forms at Pep Comics.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.772
I could check with them.

00:33.816 --> 00:36.906
Well, I'd appreciate it.
And let me know
if anything turns up.

00:36.949 --> 00:40.736
It's important that we put
this sorry mess behind us
as soon as possible.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.219
You're dreamin', Reg.

00:45.262 --> 00:48.570
Uncle Frank,
will you tell Reggie

00:48.613 --> 00:51.790
that Marilyn Monroe
is much sexier than
Elizabeth Taylor?

00:51.834 --> 00:55.229
That no one on the planet
is sexier than Marilyn Monroe.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.276
Sophia Loren. Brigitte Bardot.
Eartha Kitt.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.150
And yes, in my humble opinion,
Elizabeth Taylor.

01:04.281 --> 01:05.891

01:05.935 --> 01:07.589

01:09.852 --> 01:12.942

Principal Featherhead
last night, Archie.

01:12.985 --> 01:15.901
Tells me
your grade point average
is back up. B-plus.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.251
Like we agreed.

01:17.294 --> 01:20.080

beautiful thing I've ever seen.

01:38.271 --> 01:39.751
I didn't know you had
a hot rod.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.711
I didn't know you liked cars.

01:42.753 --> 01:45.148

Well, neither could I.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.234
-Three-speed automatic.
-Okay.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.670
Most important question.

You writers. You all have
your secret demons, don't you?

02:46.688 --> 02:49.691
It's a shame. Talented guy.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.911
Say, you wouldn't

02:52.954 --> 02:55.697
happen to know anything
about Mr. Rayberry
having a wife, would you?

02:55.740 --> 02:59.309
No. Just that he wanted us
to send half his salary

02:59.353 --> 03:01.355
to a small town
in South Carolina.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.184
Maybe she lives down there.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.533
Do you have a name
or an address?

03:05.576 --> 03:07.665
No, just a post office box.

03:16.413 --> 03:20.112
[Clay] The thing I love so much
about what Ralph Ellison did
with Invisible Man

03:20.156 --> 03:23.246
is that he took the broad idea
of existentialism

03:23.290 --> 03:26.728
and applied it specifically
to the Black American
experience.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.904
Well, what struck me most
was the novel's style.

03:28.947 --> 03:32.560
It was almost like jazz.
Very improvisational.

03:32.603 --> 03:36.781
No shock there.
Ellison was a jazz drummer
before he became a writer.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.914
Clearly it influenced his work.

03:38.957 --> 03:43.005
That said,
some of his literary criticisms
rub me the wrong way.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.529
For instance,
I love Zora Neale Hurston's

03:45.573 --> 03:47.183
Their Eyes
Were Watching God,

03:47.227 --> 03:50.404
but he called it a "blight
of calculated burlesque."

03:50.447 --> 03:51.970
I mean, I can't help
but think that's partly

03:52.014 --> 03:55.365
because it was written
about a woman and by a woman.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.758
See, I liked Hurston's book,

03:56.801 --> 03:59.326
but I do see
Ellison's concern, though.

03:59.369 --> 04:03.417
She's writing us as caricatures
for a white audience.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.506
Parts of Invisible Man
really spoke to me,

04:05.549 --> 04:08.160
but he was just so angry
and tortured all the time.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.251
Ellison's speaking
to the larger truth
of our existence.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.078
It's not a book about
day-to-day life.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.602
It's about what it feels like,

04:14.645 --> 04:16.733
in the scope
of our human experience,

04:16.778 --> 04:18.910
to walk around in our skin.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.303
[clears throat]

04:25.787 --> 04:28.703
Well, I, for one, am really
digging this conversation.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.792
So, to touch
on what Tabitha said,

04:30.835 --> 04:33.621
what were our thoughts on
Their Eyes Were
Watching God?

you can't come.

Okay, so get this.

According to Mr. Fieldstone,
Mr. Rayberry had
half of his paycheck

06:27.561 --> 06:30.520
sent to a PO box
in South Carolina.

06:30.564 --> 06:34.784
That's not something a man

to kill himself does.

Exactly.
Despite what Sheriff Keller
seems to believe.

I'm half-tempted to just
sneak into

Just to try and figure out
who that PO box belongs to.

06:44.491 --> 06:49.365

but also to see if I can find
some evidence.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.758
What kind of evidence?

06:50.801 --> 06:53.195
That he didn't kill himself.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.110
That he was the victim
of foul play.

06:57.025 --> 07:01.203
Would you maybe want
some company for that?

07:02.900 --> 07:05.163
With all due respect
to James Dean,

07:05.207 --> 07:10.342

between, say, Marlon Brando
or Paul Newman?

07:10.386 --> 07:12.388
To marry? Paul Newman.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.131
But if we're talking about
just spending one wild,
reckless night together?

I wouldn't say anything,
of course.

[chuckles] Swell!

11:57.629 --> 12:01.111
Do you want to pick me up
tonight at, say, 7:00?

12:01.851 --> 12:05.246
Oh, crap. I... [chuckles]

12:05.289 --> 12:09.946
I lent my car to Reggie,
so he could take
Veronica out tonight.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.035
That's okay.
We can take the bus.

12:12.079 --> 12:12.949
Oh.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.387
The bus? [chuckles]

12:16.431 --> 12:17.606
Or walk?

12:17.649 --> 12:18.520
Walk?

12:22.263 --> 12:23.786
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.745
Let's walk.
That sounds romantic.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.398
[both chuckle]

12:27.877 --> 12:28.922
Okay.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.287
Jughead, take a look at this.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.423
Well, whoever is in the photo,

12:53.337 --> 12:55.731
this was taken in June 1948.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.865
No, I think the woman's name
is June.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.954
And I think
these are love letters

13:00.997 --> 13:04.958
written to Mr. Rayberry
from a woman named
June Simpson.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.569
Writing to him
from South Carolina.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.136
That's the same as the PO box.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.617
Wait. So this is...

13:12.661 --> 13:14.445
Brad Rayberry's wife.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.318
Secret or otherwise.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.798
Hold on.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.019
June Simpson. She's in here.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.281
With an address
and a phone number.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.935
We have to call her, Jughead.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.589
And let her know what happened.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.330
She probably hasn't heard.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.464
[line ringing]

13:34.161 --> 13:35.162
[June] Hello?

13:36.511 --> 13:38.992
Hi. Mrs. Simpson?

13:39.035 --> 13:40.297
Who's calling, please?

13:42.082 --> 13:45.650
Um, you don't know me.
My name is Jughead Jones.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.566
I'm terribly sorry to be
the bearer of bad news, ma'am.

13:50.699 --> 13:54.181
Brad Rayberry has passed away.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.836
Who... Who is this, exactly?

13:56.879 --> 13:59.969
Uh, I worked with Mr. Rayberry.
I'm one of his friends.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.538
How did Bradley die?

14:05.409 --> 14:06.367
We're not sure.

14:08.238 --> 14:10.719
He was found in his apartment
in Seaside.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.852
Did he suffer, do you know?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.114
I hope not.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.508
I'll come as quick as I can.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.728
This is the apartment
on Magnolia Street?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.600
Yes. Um, I can...
I can be there
when you arrive.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.299
In the meantime, I'll just be
tidying up his things.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.649
Thank you.
I appreciate that. Goodbye.

14:30.739 --> 14:33.220
[Cheryl] Kevin, what happened?
Are you okay?

14:33.263 --> 14:35.787
Oh, yeah, I'm just floating
on a cloud, to be honest.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.660
And what, pray tell,
brought on this state of bliss?

14:38.703 --> 14:42.751
I just heard Clay perform
his latest poem,
"Ode to Sidney."

14:42.794 --> 14:45.623
He's like a magician,
but with his words.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.451
He is, indeed.

14:47.495 --> 14:50.890
And where did this performance
take place, if I may ask?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.240
At a meeting of Black Athena.

14:53.283 --> 14:55.764
You went?
You were allowed to go?

14:55.807 --> 14:58.985
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, Clay invited me.
[chuckles]

15:07.819 --> 15:11.388
I mean, it's freedom, Archie,
plain and simple.

15:11.432 --> 15:16.437
The freedom of not feeling
my mother's breath on my neck,
watching my every move.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.701
It's like my life is suddenly
this open road before me,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.616
and I've got both hands
on the wheel.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.619
Wheel? What wheel?
Who's got the wheel?

15:26.447 --> 15:27.361
Me.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.018
Oh. Right.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.237
[car engine roaring]

15:35.543 --> 15:37.023
Is everything okay?

15:38.111 --> 15:40.200
I'm peachy. Yeah. I'm just...

15:41.288 --> 15:42.985
[car engine sputtering]

15:47.337 --> 15:48.643
Archie, if you want
to call it a night--

15:48.686 --> 15:52.821
No, I don't. I don't.
Not at all.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.955
But I'm just wondering
where Reggie and Veronica are
on their date.

15:55.998 --> 16:00.002
I mean, where else is there
to go in Riverdale
other than Pop's?

16:00.524 --> 16:01.395
[scoffing]

16:08.097 --> 16:10.491
So, I heard
through the grapevine

16:10.534 --> 16:12.449
that Kevin attended
a Black Athena meeting.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.757
Yeah. Well,
Clay was presenting a poem

16:15.800 --> 16:18.412
and he wanted to have
his boyfriend there.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.283
Mm.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.156
Yeah, Kevin says it was
an amazing experience.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.507
Life-changing, even.

16:26.550 --> 16:29.336
Okay, Cheryl,
if you really wanna come.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.382
I do. I would love to.

16:32.426 --> 16:36.821
Okay. Well, we're gonna be
discussing Native Son,
as I mentioned.

16:36.865 --> 16:40.434
So, you can borrow my copy,
I finished it.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.655
Thank you.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.181
I do not take this lightly.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.010
I can't wait.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.760
[Archie]
You had me worried sick.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.724
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

17:12.509 --> 17:15.251
I thought you'd got into
a wreck.

17:15.295 --> 17:18.472
I kept imagining you
in a ditch somewhere,

17:18.515 --> 17:19.864
all mangled
and bleeding.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.518
Archie, cool your jets.

17:21.561 --> 17:23.433
Where did you and Veronica
even go tonight?

17:23.477 --> 17:25.695
Look, after I dropped her off,
I didn't wanna come
straight home,

17:25.740 --> 17:27.655
so I hit the freeway.

17:27.698 --> 17:28.569
You did what?

17:28.612 --> 17:29.744
I hit the freeway.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.876
I wanted to open her up
a little.

17:31.920 --> 17:32.834
See what she can do.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.749
You... You took my car?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.926
Out onto the highway?

17:37.969 --> 17:41.625
Reggie, that car is my
favorite thing
in the entire world.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.671
Anything could've happened
out there.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.544
-Am I grounded?
-No.

17:47.588 --> 17:51.418
But I sure hope you dug
your little joyride, Mantle,

17:51.461 --> 17:53.724
because that is your last time
in my car.

17:55.813 --> 17:56.684
Keys?

18:08.565 --> 18:11.133
[Frank] I heard you two fellas
going at it last night.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.792
What kind of guy does that
to a supposed friend?

18:17.835 --> 18:22.623
I built that car,
spark-plug by spark-plug,
with my dad, Uncle Frank.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.238
Listen, your pops and I,

18:30.631 --> 18:32.285
we shared a car growing up

18:32.328 --> 18:34.591
and we fought more
about that damn jalopy

18:34.635 --> 18:37.116
than Cain and Abel
did about sheep.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.075
But come on, Archie.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.469
The kid's far from home.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.775
He's far from his family,
everything he knows.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.690
He grew up scraping by.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.563
Working his ass off for things
that guys like us
take for granted.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.827
Can't you give him a break?

18:59.529 --> 19:02.445
Well, how was the date?
Worth the wait?

19:03.359 --> 19:06.275
It was not stellar.

19:06.319 --> 19:09.974
Archie was distracted
the whole time.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.455
How was it with you and Reggie?

19:12.499 --> 19:15.806
Mixed. Usually, boys want to go
parking with me,

19:15.850 --> 19:18.592
not cruising around town.

19:18.635 --> 19:22.596
But, straight from the fridge,
he too seemed preoccupied.

19:22.639 --> 19:26.165
Kept glancing at his watch
like he had somewhere to go.

19:28.732 --> 19:32.171
Maybe we should switch
dance partners and try again?

19:32.214 --> 19:34.260
Or maybe we try a double date?

19:34.303 --> 19:37.654
[gasps] I know just the event.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.743
Have you heard about
this big concert
in Centerville?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.049
Mm-mm.

19:41.092 --> 19:43.225
All the hipsters and hep cats
will be there.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.141
What say we give our beaus
a chance to redeem themselves

19:46.185 --> 19:49.710
for being such unlicked cubs?

19:49.753 --> 19:53.235
[Tabitha]
Their words are so beautiful,
Jughead.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.237
Describing how
their love endured

19:55.281 --> 19:57.065
despite everything
they went through.

19:57.108 --> 19:59.067
What happened to them?

19:59.110 --> 20:01.243
Well, from what I could
piece together,
they got married in New York

20:01.287 --> 20:04.333
and then they moved
to June's hometown

20:04.377 --> 20:06.379
in South Carolina
to start a family.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.990
But there was an incident.

20:09.033 --> 20:11.122
Their lives were threatened.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.124
Oh, geez.

20:13.168 --> 20:17.259
White thugs threw a brick
through their window.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.523
Burned a cross in their yard.

20:20.567 --> 20:23.439
They went to the police,
who threatened to arrest them.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.920
Not the thugs. Them.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.185
That's horrible.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.536
I saw things like that
every single day
I was on tour with Mrs. Till.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.324
In any case,
the Rayberrys were terrified.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.762
Not just for themselves,
but for the safety
of June's family.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.981
That's why Mr. Rayberry left.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.853
And settled in Seaside, yes.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.421
I think the plan was
that they were gonna save up
enough money

20:48.464 --> 20:50.771
to get June's family
somewhere safe.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.730
And then they were gonna go
live in Paris as expats.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.952
But if they had such
a clear plan,

20:57.995 --> 20:59.997
why would Mr. Rayberry
take his own life?

21:00.041 --> 21:04.959
Unless, as you keep saying,
he didn't.

21:11.313 --> 21:12.836
Reg, wait up.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.708
What, did you find a dent
in your fender or something?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.449
Look, I'm sorry
about last night.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.625
I lost my cool.

21:20.844 --> 21:24.152
In that case,
I'm sorry for miscounting
the trumps.

21:24.195 --> 21:28.069
What can I say? I'm car-crazy.
It's a disease.

21:28.112 --> 21:29.026
[Betty] Oh, fellas.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.684
Better clear your dance cards.

21:34.728 --> 21:38.297
Fangs is playing a concert
in Centerville and we wanna go,

21:38.340 --> 21:40.299
so you're taking us
on a double-date.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.213
First to dinner,
then to the show.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.345
Any questions?

21:45.304 --> 21:49.003
For some of you, this was
perhaps your first time
reading Wright's

21:49.046 --> 21:51.484
harrowing
and thought-provoking novel.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.747
Of course, it was my third.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.271
Now, I obviously have
a lot of thoughts,

21:56.315 --> 21:57.794
but I wanna hear
from all of y'all first.

21:59.579 --> 22:02.495
The book asks, "Where does
responsibility lie?"

22:02.538 --> 22:07.021
While Bigger does kill Mary,
the young white daughter
of the rich Dalton family,

22:07.064 --> 22:11.678
the story, in my mind,
remains a cautionary tale
about, well--

22:11.721 --> 22:13.157
The dangers of white ignorance.

22:13.201 --> 22:16.683
Exactly. Wright doesn't give us
any easy answers.

22:16.726 --> 22:19.076
That's what's so great
about it, though.

22:19.120 --> 22:22.993
He looks at society as a whole
and how it works
to keep us oppressed.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.039
Bigger commits murder,

22:25.082 --> 22:27.911
but his true crime is stepping
outside the box

22:27.955 --> 22:29.739
that white society built
around him.

22:29.783 --> 22:32.394
I'll say it. I thought Bigger
was a stereotype.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.962
Wright doesn't give him
enough agency
to break the mold.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.572
James Baldwin would agree
with you.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.792
And all roads lead to Baldwin,
right, Clay?

22:38.835 --> 22:39.706
[chuckles]

22:40.881 --> 22:42.578
They do, Kev.

22:42.622 --> 22:45.407
Cheryl, do you have
anything to add?

22:46.190 --> 22:47.844
Oh, no. [chuckles]

22:52.240 --> 22:53.894
Um...

22:53.937 --> 22:59.116
Only that this was the most
powerful novel I've ever read.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.687
And that the family
in the book, the Daltons,

23:06.776 --> 23:08.778
reminded me a lot
of my own family

23:10.519 --> 23:11.955
in some unpleasant ways.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.742
But I'm very glad
to have read it,

23:15.785 --> 23:19.136
and to be learning more
about it.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.096
Just out of curiosity,
is Native Sonthe only novel

23:22.139 --> 23:24.098
by a Black author
that you've ever read?

23:26.448 --> 23:27.493
Yes.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.104
But I can't wait to read more.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.932
You won't be shocked
to hear, Cheryl,

23:31.975 --> 23:34.630
that I maintain
an ever-evolving syllabus
of Black authors

23:34.674 --> 23:38.939
I believe everyone,
regardless of who they are
or where they're from,

23:38.982 --> 23:40.593
should be reading.

23:40.636 --> 23:43.857
I gave it to Kevin.
I'd be jazzed
to share it with you.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.249
Thank you, Clay.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.120
Of course.

23:50.559 --> 23:55.695
Now. Moving on
to Baldwin's essay.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.523
[Sheriff Keller]
Let me get this straight.

23:57.566 --> 24:02.092
In your expert opinion,
Brad Rayberry
didn't kill himself?

24:02.136 --> 24:03.093
No.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.054
Well, what happened
to him, then?

24:08.577 --> 24:10.449
Well, to put
a fine point on it,

24:10.492 --> 24:11.885
disguising murder as suicide

24:11.928 --> 24:14.061
has been a gimmick
in detective fiction

24:14.104 --> 24:16.411
since the days
of Arthur Conan Doyle.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.108
Let me ask you this.

24:18.152 --> 24:22.548
How well did you really know
your so-called hero, Jughead?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.854
Well enough to know
that he wouldn't take
his own life.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.943
Uh-huh.

24:26.987 --> 24:30.251
Did you also know that he was
a card-carrying member
of the Communist Party?

24:30.294 --> 24:31.165
[scoffs]

24:32.688 --> 24:35.648
How about the fact
that he was a draft dodger

24:35.691 --> 24:38.520
who protested the Korean War?

24:38.564 --> 24:41.001
That he was a dope fiend.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.351
He spent a month
as a mental patient

24:43.394 --> 24:45.484
at St. Vincent's
in New York City.

24:52.926 --> 24:55.929
This... This is impossible.

24:55.972 --> 24:59.193
Now, I'm no head-shrinker,
but if you ask me,

24:59.236 --> 25:04.067
someone who's got
that many secrets?

25:04.111 --> 25:07.854
Well, it's a miracle he didn't
take his own life sooner.

25:21.737 --> 25:25.088
I'm curious to hear
how you thought
the meeting went.

25:25.132 --> 25:28.265
Better than I thought
it would, actually.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.224
I'm relieved.

25:30.267 --> 25:34.010
I was worried people would feel
uncomfortable around you.

25:34.054 --> 25:37.579
Or that you would feel
uncomfortable
around my friends.

25:40.234 --> 25:43.106
They were, and I was.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.935
Not so much uncomfortable
as I was worried

25:45.979 --> 25:48.634
that I wasn't going to say
the right thing at first.

25:48.677 --> 25:49.896
But then--

25:49.939 --> 25:52.725
But then,
everyone settled in nicely.

25:52.768 --> 25:55.205
It was really nice
to have you here.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.206
It was.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.342
But I think you were right
to be so protective
of Black Athena.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.910
It's your club, your space.

26:03.953 --> 26:06.477
I am so grateful
that I got to experience it,

26:06.521 --> 26:09.742
and that I got to see
first-hand what you're so
passionate about.

26:09.785 --> 26:16.313
But I think in the future
I will just attend
the more public events.

26:16.357 --> 26:20.666
Well, we are hosting
an open mic night
at the Dark Room next month.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.363
I will be there front row.

26:22.406 --> 26:26.019
And maybe you can read
some more books
off Clay's list.

26:26.062 --> 26:27.498
Absolutely.

26:27.542 --> 26:32.678
And maybe afterward
we could discuss them together?

26:32.721 --> 26:35.028
Well, I can dig that plan.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.342
Also, what are you
doing tonight?

26:45.386 --> 26:48.607
Midge mentioned that there was
a concert in Centerville.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.609
Would you wanna go?

26:53.176 --> 26:56.745
I am certain
I could make myself available.

27:05.188 --> 27:08.583
[June] This is the last letter
I received from Bradley.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.847
Given the date, he must have
mailed it right before...

27:13.240 --> 27:14.197
his passing.

27:17.113 --> 27:21.291
In it, he wrote about
finally wanting
to have his novel published.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.338
He did? Really?

27:27.341 --> 27:30.605
"If a publisher takes it,
we'll at last have
the money we need

27:30.649 --> 27:34.914
to buy your parents a place
in the city and move to Paris.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.611
After everything
we've been through,

27:36.655 --> 27:40.136
I'm filled with such optimism
about our future."

27:41.834 --> 27:44.488
Now, I'm not a detective
like Miss Marple,

27:44.532 --> 27:47.491
but that doesn't sound
like a man planning
to take his life.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.929
No. It sure doesn't.

27:49.972 --> 27:53.672
Mrs. Simpson, Sheriff Keller
told me some things
about your husband.

27:55.238 --> 27:58.851
That he was a war protester
and a communist.

28:00.156 --> 28:03.420
And that he'd been to
an asylum.

28:05.074 --> 28:05.945
Mm-hmm.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.209
And that's true.

28:09.252 --> 28:12.473
But did he also tell you
that Bradley served
in World War II?

28:12.516 --> 28:17.434
And that he became addicted
to opium
because of a war injury?

28:17.478 --> 28:22.352
And that he checked himself
into St. Vincent's voluntarily?

28:22.396 --> 28:26.095
And yes, he attended a couple
of communist meetings

28:26.139 --> 28:30.621
when he was young
and curious and suffering

28:30.665 --> 28:32.580
during the Great Depression.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.364
That makes sense.

28:34.408 --> 28:35.757
I'll tell you this.

28:35.801 --> 28:38.020
My husband was an optimist.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.588
Despite everything life
threw at him.

28:40.631 --> 28:44.113
Even when he was working
as a janitor
at the maple factory,

28:44.157 --> 28:46.246
stuck on the graveyard shift,

28:46.289 --> 28:48.204
he never lost his
sense of humor.

28:48.248 --> 28:53.122
He always believed
something better
was around the corner.

28:54.907 --> 28:56.909
If Mr. Rayberry didn't take
his own life,

28:56.952 --> 28:59.041
means that someone else
is responsible.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.175
Do you have any idea who?

29:02.784 --> 29:04.090
Or why?

29:04.133 --> 29:06.266
The world can be
a brutal place.

29:06.309 --> 29:10.357
God knows who Bradley
might have angered or upset.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.796
I've seen a lot of people do
horrific things in my day.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.542
If you want to look into
Brad's death, young man,
I won't stop you.

29:25.415 --> 29:28.375
Take a gander.
You won't believe
the bitchin' rigs on this one.

29:28.418 --> 29:31.030
Serves us right for stopping
at the newsstand.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.553
Classy chassis.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.947
Check out the flip-top box
on page 13.

29:36.296 --> 29:37.253
[whistles]

29:37.297 --> 29:39.429
Whoa. Fat city.

29:39.473 --> 29:43.825
You know, Steve McQueen used to
drive us around Hollywood
in his '53 Hudson Hornet.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.220
And believe me,
you've never heard anything
purr quite like that.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.136
I've fixed up more than
a few V8s in my day.

29:50.179 --> 29:53.356
My dad says I've never met
an engine I couldn't repair.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.924
Damn! The plating
on these rims...

29:55.968 --> 29:57.360
[Archie whistles] Cherry.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.536
I'd agitate the gravel
with those chromes.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.974
Boys!
Aren't we going to be late?

30:03.540 --> 30:05.716
For the show?
We're still going to the show,
I hope?

30:05.760 --> 30:08.458
If we don't leave now,
we'll never make it
to Centerville on time.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.504
Yeah, you're right.
We should boogie.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.552
What are you doing?

30:15.596 --> 30:17.337
Oh, I just thought,
since we're late,
it'd be better if I--

30:17.380 --> 30:19.948
Well, you drove
on the way here.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.732
It's my car, I'll drive.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.299
[Reggie]
Okay, yeah, just make sure
you don't flood the engine

30:23.343 --> 30:24.474
when you start 'er up,
'cause sometimes--

30:24.518 --> 30:25.475
I got it, Reg.

30:32.569 --> 30:35.529
So what's next for you,
Mrs. Simpson?

30:35.572 --> 30:39.881
I'm going to bury my husband
where we first met.

30:39.925 --> 30:44.146
And then I suppose
I'm going to see about
getting his novel published.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.453
Let us know if we can help
in any way.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.063
I will, dear.

30:48.107 --> 30:50.457
You know, Bradley always loved
comic books.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.285
Since I knew him.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.895
I'm sure he'd be happy
for you to continue
adapting his stories.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.550
I'd be honored.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.769
And I'll talk to Mr. Fieldstone
about doing
a tribute issue.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.033
With all the proceeds going
to you and your family,
of course.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.861
That would be much appreciated.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.910
Tell me,
are you two going steady?

31:09.998 --> 31:11.434
-Who? Us? [chuckles]
-Oh, no. No.

31:11.478 --> 31:14.437
-I mean...
-We're classmates.

31:14.481 --> 31:18.702
-And friends, I would say.
-Good friends.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.922
-Yeah.
-Pals.

31:20.966 --> 31:25.013
Well, you two take care
of each other.
That's important.

31:52.214 --> 31:53.912
Arch, do you need a hand?

32:01.136 --> 32:03.138
Unfortunately, Betty,

32:03.182 --> 32:06.446
it seems as though
someone goofed it and forgot
to fill up the gas tank.

32:06.489 --> 32:11.320
Okay. So the problem is
we need to get gas
and we need to beat feet, fast.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.932
Well, considering the fact
that I'm in stilettos

32:13.975 --> 32:16.412
and Pop's is five miles back
that way,

32:16.456 --> 32:19.154
might I suggest you two cool it
and start walking

32:19.198 --> 32:21.722
while we stay here
and huddle for warmth?

32:35.431 --> 32:36.432
[shudders]

32:51.186 --> 32:52.709
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:52.753 --> 32:54.320
-Hey!
-Hey! Hey!

33:00.282 --> 33:01.980
So I've been thinking--

33:02.023 --> 33:03.807
Why don't you see
if Clifford Blossom
can get you a car?

33:03.851 --> 33:05.548
Get bent.

33:05.592 --> 33:08.116
Why not? Clifford Blossom
will do anything
to keep you happy.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.770
Star players get perks
all the time.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.685
No way.
I don't want to be any deeper

33:11.728 --> 33:13.992
in that creep's pocket
than I already am.

33:14.035 --> 33:18.126
It's bad enough
he's paying someone to work
on my dad's farm in my place.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.215
Is that how you see me?

33:20.259 --> 33:22.391
As a germ
who's looking for handouts?

33:22.435 --> 33:25.394
Ah, jeez, you don't have to be
so touchy about it.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.397
What's the matter, Andrews?
Am I too uppity for you?

33:28.441 --> 33:31.226
Hmm? Borrowing your car
instead of waxing it?

33:31.270 --> 33:33.489
Eating off of your mom's
nice dinner plates?

33:33.533 --> 33:35.622
You're ringing up
the wrong area code, Reg.

33:35.665 --> 33:36.536
Then what?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.626
Am I forgetting my place?

33:39.669 --> 33:42.542
You better knock
that giant chip
off your shoulder.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.675
Oh, yeah?
Or maybe I oughta knock
the one off yours.

33:48.678 --> 33:49.766
[both grunting]

33:57.687 --> 33:59.646
Wait. Wait.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.219
[both grunting]

34:09.960 --> 34:10.831
Submit.

34:11.918 --> 34:12.789
Submit.

34:14.878 --> 34:15.748
[blows]

34:20.101 --> 34:21.101
Hello.

34:23.364 --> 34:24.453
[both] Cheryl?

34:24.496 --> 34:27.152
And Toni Topaz and Midge Klump.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.719
Are you ladies having
car trouble?

34:29.763 --> 34:34.333
We were on our way
to see Fangs perform,
but we ran out of gas.

34:34.376 --> 34:36.378
Right on!
That's where we're going.

34:37.858 --> 34:40.295
Well, hop on in.
The more, the merrier.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.688
It'll be a blast and a half.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.386
What about the boys?

34:44.429 --> 34:47.259
With all due respect
to those wet rags,

34:47.302 --> 34:49.174
who cares about the boys?

34:49.217 --> 34:50.958
[Jughead]
What an incredible lady.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.568
Really makes you think.

34:52.612 --> 34:55.658
Yes. About a lot of things.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.660
Like?

34:57.704 --> 35:01.621
Like that I should go back
on the road with my folks.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.885
As hard as the tour was... Is.

35:04.928 --> 35:07.366
Yeah, I was wondering.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.455
I was planning
to take some time off.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.674
To rest. Reevaluate.

35:11.718 --> 35:18.072
But meeting June,
reading her letters
to Mr. Rayberry.

35:18.116 --> 35:22.163
Not that I needed a reminder,
but it was one.

35:25.384 --> 35:28.822
You're fighting for people
to be free
and live their lives.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.825
And to love
who they wanna love.

35:33.827 --> 35:37.700
There's nothing more meaningful
than that.

35:37.744 --> 35:41.530
Well, maybe this time
you'll actually send me
my homework?

35:41.574 --> 35:44.316
Yeah. Yes, yes, I will.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.231
Maybe I'll send you
some letters too.

35:50.452 --> 35:54.239
So, you boys wanna tell me
what happened?

35:54.282 --> 35:56.980
I was stupid enough
to think that I was
lending my car

35:57.024 --> 35:58.678
to someone that I could trust.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.680
Yep. And I was
stupid enough

36:00.723 --> 36:02.812
to believe someone
when they said
we were Bulldog brothers.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.423
[Pop] I don't know
about all that,

36:04.466 --> 36:06.686
but if this is over some car,

36:06.729 --> 36:09.341
I've got an abandoned
jalopy in my garage.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.432
Why don't you
take it off my hands, Reggie?

36:13.475 --> 36:15.564
You'd actually
be doing me a favor.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.523
That'd be incredible, Pop.

36:17.566 --> 36:21.179
Bet they'd let you keep it
in the shop class
at the high school too.

36:21.222 --> 36:22.789
How's that sound
to you boys?

36:22.832 --> 36:26.140
-Great.
-Swell. Well, thank you, Pop.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.447
-Thanks, Pop.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.188
Great. Great. Go.

36:31.711 --> 36:34.017
I wanna come clean
about something.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.194
The night I took Veronica out,

36:36.237 --> 36:38.283
I didn't go joyriding
afterwards.

36:38.326 --> 36:39.893
That's not why I got back late.

36:41.111 --> 36:44.854
Hold the line.
Well, where were you, then?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.945
I drove home to Duck Creek
to see my folks.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.382
How come?

36:50.425 --> 36:51.818
[Reggie]
I was feeling homesick.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.082
[Archie]
Why didn't you just
tell me that?

36:55.125 --> 36:58.216
I can't go around
telling people
I miss my morn and dad.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.177
Well, I've never really thought
about it like this.

37:03.221 --> 37:08.226
But I've always felt
a little homesick ever since
my dad left for Korea.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.923
That's the best way
to describe it.

37:10.837 --> 37:11.707
Homesick.

37:13.622 --> 37:16.408
[sighs] Like I said,
he was my best friend.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.279
I've never really
had one since.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.715
What about Betty?

37:19.759 --> 37:22.892
Or what's-his-name,
Beef Soup? Soup Can?

37:22.936 --> 37:25.199
[both laugh]

37:25.243 --> 37:26.200
You mean Jughead?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.810
[laughing] Yeah. Jughead.

37:29.812 --> 37:31.771
I guess you can't really talk
V8s with him.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.426
No, not really.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.776
He's a good egg, though.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.606
And Betty. She's... [chuckles]

37:45.828 --> 37:48.222
Anyway, how's things back home
with your folks?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.789
The same as always.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.486
They're working hard,
missing me.

37:51.530 --> 37:55.403
But they're happy I ended up
in a good home.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.578
With good people.

37:58.232 --> 37:59.625
You're good people, Archie.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.542
Yeah, you too, Reg.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.544
My dad would've got
a kick out of you.

38:05.587 --> 38:07.415
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

38:07.459 --> 38:10.984
Hey, you think the girls
are gonna go ape on us?
[laughs]

38:13.726 --> 38:14.770
Uh...

38:17.164 --> 38:18.513
Where are the girls?

38:30.003 --> 38:31.831

[sighs]

39:00.686 --> 39:02.601
I can't believe you came
to my gig.

39:02.644 --> 39:06.387
If you thought I was gonna miss
the biggest show
of your career,

39:06.431 --> 39:08.346
you've got a screw loose.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.086
Thank God
you're so stubborn, Midge.

39:10.130 --> 39:13.742
'Cause it turns out,
you were my lucky charm.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.571
What's this, hon?

39:16.615 --> 39:21.271
It's the business card
of a music producer
from Phantom Rock Records.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.249
That's in worse shape than mine
when we found it.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.730
Careful. Watch what you say
about Bella.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.341
Bella?

39:47.385 --> 39:49.865
Yeah. I always dreamed about
having a car named Bella.

39:50.518 --> 39:52.738
Oh, Bella it is.

39:52.781 --> 39:54.740
I thought you could use a hand
souping her up a little.

39:54.783 --> 39:57.003
I could.
That's why I asked Betty.

40:00.833 --> 40:01.834
Betty?

40:01.877 --> 40:03.531
Hey, Arch.
Are you helping out too?

40:06.578 --> 40:09.015
Uh, yeah, I suppose.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.625
By the way,
I was telling Reggie,

40:10.669 --> 40:13.193
you two missed
an incredible show last night.

40:13.236 --> 40:15.021
Fangs for sure
is the next big thing.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.066
He blew the roof off
the Armory!

40:17.110 --> 40:18.111
[chuckles softly]

40:21.810 --> 40:23.769
-Um...
-Yeah.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.466
-Can I have that one?
Thanks.
-Yep.

40:26.075 --> 40:26.946
What?

40:27.686 --> 40:29.427
What? Oh. Nothing.

40:30.297 --> 40:31.167
Thanks.

40:40.568 --> 40:41.830
[knock on door]

40:55.888 --> 40:57.019
Oh, hello.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.239
You must be a friend
of Mr. Rayberry's.

40:59.282 --> 41:02.634
Such a shame
what happened to him,
may he rest in peace.

41:02.677 --> 41:03.983
Thank you.

41:04.026 --> 41:06.507
Well, I hate to impose,
I'm Mrs. Martin.

41:06.551 --> 41:09.336
I just live down the hall
and I've run out of milk
for my kitty.

41:09.379 --> 41:13.166
I was wondering
if there might be any
in Mr. Rayberry's refrigerator.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.348
How strange.

41:21.391 --> 41:23.655
I wonder what happened
to the milk bottles.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.134
Milk bottles?

41:25.178 --> 41:27.267
A few nights ago,
I heard the milkman making

41:27.310 --> 41:30.836
an unusually late delivery
to this apartment.

41:30.879 --> 41:32.577
The milkman? You saw him?

41:32.620 --> 41:35.057
No. I was inside my apartment.

41:35.101 --> 41:36.015
But I heard him.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.410
[Jughead] How do you hear
a milkman?

41:40.454 --> 41:43.239
[Mrs. Martin] The distinct
rattle of the glass bottles,
of course.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.330
My kitty heard it right away.

41:47.374 --> 41:50.551
Because it is just about
her favorite sound
in the whole world.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.510
Isn't that right, Miss Kitty?

41:52.553 --> 41:55.034
[cat yowling]
