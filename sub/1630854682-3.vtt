WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.301
- And your name is...?
- Uh, I go by switch.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.303
- Get in, plant the devices,

00:05.339 --> 00:06.572
We'll let you know
when they're engaged.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.573
(screaming)

00:07.708 --> 00:09.307
- Sweet baby jesus!

00:10.444 --> 00:13.244
- Switch 89.
Restocking the sand bags.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.248
- He's using the video game
to sell drugs!

00:17.051 --> 00:18.250
- You're under arrest.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.419
Hey! Gtpd, stop!

00:20.421 --> 00:22.988
(crying)
- no, no, no, no, no!

00:23.057 --> 00:24.189
Don't cry!

00:24.191 --> 00:26.158
If I can't even babysit,

00:26.293 --> 00:28.394
What am I gonna do
if we have our own family?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.962
- He who never showers
never shines.

00:29.964 --> 00:30.995
- You're right.
Okay, I'll shower.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.464
Thanks, sweetie.
- Okay.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.332
- Prove me wrong.
Prove yourselves.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.035
But until then, neither of you
are part of the a-team.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.210
(breathing heavily)

00:55.056 --> 00:56.488
(grunts)

00:58.025 --> 01:00.191
(panting)

01:03.263 --> 01:04.429
(sighs)

01:06.367 --> 01:07.833
- Morning, babe.
- Morning.

01:09.336 --> 01:10.702
(sighs)

01:16.877 --> 01:18.510
(playful music)

01:18.546 --> 01:19.845
Gotta get to work!

01:20.914 --> 01:22.247
- So this is my life now?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.216
- Aw...
(chuckling)

01:24.351 --> 01:27.052
He didn't mean it.
Did you, brixy?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.786
- Yeah, this is the third
morning in a row

01:28.823 --> 01:30.589
Little brixy's peed on me.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.923
Starting to take it
personal, bro.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.392
- Catch. Nice!

01:34.462 --> 01:35.827
(chuckling)

01:35.896 --> 01:37.863
Oh, shoot, did you put the, um,
teething rings in the--

01:37.998 --> 01:39.331
- Freezer? Already done.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.466
- Oh, yes, nice!

01:41.469 --> 01:42.868
(exclaiming)

01:42.937 --> 01:44.803
We getting the hang of this,
aren't we?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.005
- Yeah, just a little bit.
We in charge, bro.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.072
(baby squealing)

01:48.109 --> 01:49.007
(phone chimes)

01:49.076 --> 01:49.941
Oh.

01:50.010 --> 01:51.409
(knocking)

01:52.546 --> 01:53.444
(baby fussing)

01:54.214 --> 01:55.347
(whispering): Who is that?

01:55.482 --> 01:56.681
Who's at the door?

01:59.453 --> 02:00.552
- Karina!

02:00.687 --> 02:01.887
What are you doing here?

02:01.956 --> 02:04.022
- Well, top of the morning
to you too.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.090
(gasps)

02:05.159 --> 02:06.425
- Karina...

02:07.561 --> 02:08.760
Aren't you supposed
to be at the hospital?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.429
- Damn, does anybody
say "hi" around here?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.631
Hi!

02:12.700 --> 02:14.032
Okay, okay...

02:14.068 --> 02:16.168
The doctor came by this morning

02:16.170 --> 02:17.569
And gave me a clean
bill of health.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.171
- Okay, wait...
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.906
Um, I thought you had
physical therapy

02:20.975 --> 02:22.241
For at least another week.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.243
- I excel at everything,
why not rehabilitation?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.578
(scoffs)
- humility becomes you.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.646
- Doesn't it?
Uh, where's brix's bag?

02:28.682 --> 02:31.249
- Uh, upstairs, I'll get it.
- Thank you. Hi!

02:31.285 --> 02:32.718
- Wait, why do you need his bag?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.388
Are you leaving? Like, now?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.656
(baby fussing)

02:37.791 --> 02:39.925
- Well, not unless
you're making breakfast.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.860
- But karina,
what are you talking about?

02:41.995 --> 02:44.062
You didn't call,
you didn't send a text.

02:44.098 --> 02:46.331
And we know how much
you love a strongly worded

02:46.400 --> 02:47.599
Yet concise email.

02:47.635 --> 02:49.334
- Mm.
- Come on, man,

02:49.336 --> 02:50.969
We're just getting
into a routine.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.005
- Look, I am so grateful

02:53.007 --> 02:54.606
That you were there for brix
when I couldn't be.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.675
But we need to get back
to our life, kelly.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.677
And you and nathan
need to do the same.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.245
(sighs)

03:00.380 --> 03:03.682
- As much as I hate to admit it.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.818
I know you're right.
- I know.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.753
And remember,
we're only two hours away

03:08.789 --> 03:10.422
And we will visit all the time.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.890
So...

03:12.025 --> 03:13.825
Come on, give me back
my baby, kel.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.093
Kelly.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.895
Ke... Kel.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.231
Give me back my baby.
Give me back my baby!

03:19.300 --> 03:20.699
- What do you...
- Come on, man,

03:20.701 --> 03:21.767
Give me back my baby.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.703
♪ baby love, my baby love ♪

03:24.705 --> 03:28.874
♪ I need you,
oh how I need you ♪

03:29.009 --> 03:31.577
♪ but all you do
is treat me bad ♪

03:31.712 --> 03:32.910
- Sam wazowski.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.846
Looking good.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.449
- Thanks. You're here early.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.850
- I've been burning
the midnight oil

03:38.886 --> 03:40.986
Tracking this
purple crystal stuff.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.454
You know, I could use
your eyes on something.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.790
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.326
You see--
- oh f--!

03:47.461 --> 03:49.861
- Geez, I'm sorry, my bad.
- No, no.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.262
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.232
- I didn't mean to hit you...
- Yeah.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.333
- ...In your head.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.601
(sighs)

03:56.604 --> 03:58.469
- Good morning!

04:03.744 --> 04:05.343
What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.211
- Alright, people,
let's look alive.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.614
Here we go.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.816
- What is this?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.052
A pop quiz?

04:15.990 --> 04:17.289
- What's an ipr?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.224
- I got this.
Intellectual property rights.

04:19.359 --> 04:20.492
- Hey, how do you know that?

04:20.561 --> 04:22.760
- Oh, I invented
finger stickies, yeah.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.029
I was actually gonna
call them finger lickies--

04:24.098 --> 04:25.097
- Yeah, no, you know what?

04:25.232 --> 04:26.998
Fascinating, but in this case,

04:27.034 --> 04:29.300
It stands for
individual progress report,

04:29.336 --> 04:32.037
Emphasis on "individual".
These are necessary metrics

04:32.172 --> 04:34.706
I apparently need to support
my decision-making around here.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.042
- Question, do we get
to fill these out ourselves?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.111
- Yeah. But it's not
an opportunity

04:39.246 --> 04:41.580
To toot your own horns, right?
This is a practical form.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.915
Just lays out the case
progress, right?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.117
Impact of your bust,
number of guns you apprehend,

04:46.153 --> 04:48.119
Street value of the drugs,
that sort of thing.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.021
- Uh, respectfully, commander,

04:50.024 --> 04:51.422
Is this the best use
of our time?

04:52.559 --> 04:53.858
- If it wasn't, would I
be giving them to you,

04:53.894 --> 04:54.860
Detective sergeant greene?

04:54.995 --> 04:56.762
- Uh... I think
it's a great idea.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.063
I think it's a fantastic idea.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.598
Like, such a good idea like
the um, you know the...

05:01.935 --> 05:03.435
The... The finger stickies.
- Oh, thank you, samantha--

05:03.570 --> 05:04.736
- No--
- thank you, sam. Okay, people.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.738
Come on, let's get busy.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.840
There's been a 30% increase
in 911 calls

05:08.876 --> 05:11.676
From university campuses
over the past couple of weeks,

05:11.679 --> 05:13.545
Students having
violent outbursts,

05:13.680 --> 05:14.813
Students having seizures,

05:14.882 --> 05:17.416
Students walking around so high,
they're like zombies.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.351
- Zombies who lick?
- What?

05:19.420 --> 05:20.752
- It sounds like those
purple crystals.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.053
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know what?

05:22.122 --> 05:23.821
There were four kids
admitted last night

05:23.857 --> 05:24.889
To st. Mikes.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.625
Nobody knows anything
about this drug,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.227
Where it's coming from,
who's selling it,

05:29.229 --> 05:31.562
So we're really gonna
roll up our sleeves here,

05:31.598 --> 05:33.498
This is high priority. Go.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.266
- We can talk to switch,

05:35.302 --> 05:36.901
See if we can figure out
where his supplier is.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.069
- Good!
- We could head down

05:38.105 --> 05:39.204
To st. Mikes and interview
these kids.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.571
- Yes.
- Maybe sam and I

05:40.607 --> 05:42.574
Can go to u of t,
ask around, get some intel.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.441
- Yeah.
- No.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.676
I've got some
black-market pistols

05:44.745 --> 05:46.444
I want you to look into.
Not much to go on,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.112
Just some debriefing notes.
Okay everybody,

05:48.148 --> 05:51.315
Iprs due the end of each day,
please, and thank you!

05:52.319 --> 05:53.618
- Okay, I'm sorry,
what does this mean?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.720
- You got benched. Again.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.322
(laughing)

05:57.391 --> 05:59.391
- Well, I'm not just
going to sit by.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.228
(angry muttering)

06:06.867 --> 06:08.399
(kelly growls)

06:08.435 --> 06:10.202
- I have about ten minutes
before I have to be

06:10.337 --> 06:12.069
On the front steps
for a press conference.

06:12.106 --> 06:13.138
What do you want?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.806
- Okay, you need to speak
to the unit commander.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.141
- Yeah, because she keeps
putting us

06:16.143 --> 06:17.542
On these random ass cases.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.478
- You doing a good job
with them?

06:19.613 --> 06:21.212
- Of course we are.
- So what's the problem?

06:21.248 --> 06:22.414
- That's what we want to know,

06:22.483 --> 06:23.882
'cause it feels like
she's targeting us.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.950
- Yeah, when we should be
targeting this deadly new drug,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.486
But she keeps beaver-damming us.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.821
- Boss, maybe we're reading
all this wrong,

06:29.857 --> 06:32.223
But just in case,
can you talk to her?

06:33.193 --> 06:35.227
Please?
- Okay, I'll feel her out,

06:35.229 --> 06:37.429
But in the meantime,
keep your noses down,

06:37.431 --> 06:39.531
Do the work.
- Work?

06:39.666 --> 06:42.767
You mean homework.
Like, in the form of these iprs.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.003
- I-p what now?
- Exactly.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.372
- Oh... I think I know
what this is about.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.375
Okay, um...

06:50.377 --> 06:53.712
Gloria and I, we have
our firearm requalification

06:53.847 --> 06:55.313
Together later today. Ju...

06:55.382 --> 06:57.582
Give me some time,
I'll deal with it.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.516
- Thank you.

07:01.054 --> 07:04.256
By the way, you look amazing.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.658
- Everyone is gonna be saying,
"who is the hottie

07:06.660 --> 07:08.660
On the steps
of the police station?"

07:12.933 --> 07:13.998
- Yep.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.300
I still got it.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.172
- So, um...

07:22.409 --> 07:24.743
You and naz looked
a little cozy this morning.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.477
What was that about?
- Nothing, it was work.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.713
We're... Work.
- Oh, I see,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.381
You were just looking
for your next lead

07:30.451 --> 07:31.750
In each other's eyes?

07:31.752 --> 07:32.817
- We're, uh...
(clears throat)

07:32.820 --> 07:34.553
...Colleagues.
We're colleagues and...

07:35.522 --> 07:37.222
I chose steve, remember? So...

07:41.761 --> 07:43.761
- Wow, check this out.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.030
These three black-market pistols

07:45.165 --> 07:46.564
Were all picked up
in the grasslands.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.700
- That's weird.
It was like six months ago,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.435
And I was in uniform,
and we conducted a very

07:50.437 --> 07:52.504
Successful clean-up initiative
in that very neighbourhood.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.505
- Huh...
- Wait a second,

07:53.574 --> 07:54.839
Look at these guns,
they're identical.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.541
- Yeah.
- Check out the marks on them.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.843
These are all crosses,
which is the signature

07:58.879 --> 08:00.645
For the crosses gang
in the grassland.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.713
(inhales deeply)

08:01.848 --> 08:04.916
- Okay, I really think
you should rethink

08:04.985 --> 08:06.918
Calling that neighbourhood
clean-up a success.

08:07.955 --> 08:08.954
- Look, just what I thought.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.255
The crosses were all arrested

08:10.257 --> 08:11.389
In a big bust last year.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.823
- Wait, so they're all in jail?

08:13.927 --> 08:16.494
- Except for one.
Percival "trigger" simmons.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.730
Head of the gang, released early
for good behaviour.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.866
About two months ago
around the same time

08:21.001 --> 08:23.201
The first gun was apprehended.
- Trigger.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.003
Now that doesn't scream

08:25.005 --> 08:26.805
"illegal firearms dealer"
at all.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.606
- Let's start making some calls

08:28.675 --> 08:30.074
And see if we can track
trigger down.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.480
(distant gate buzzing)

08:38.018 --> 08:41.152
- So, how's the lakeshore
treating you, switch?

08:41.288 --> 08:42.287
- Like a king.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.623
What do you think?
- Well, help us help you.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.025
Tell us who your supplier is.

08:47.160 --> 08:47.993
- I don't know.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.363
I only sold purple rain
the one time, barely a player.

08:51.498 --> 08:52.631
- Is that what
they're calling it?

08:53.833 --> 08:55.100
That's very interesting.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.702
Because the inventory list
on your laptop

08:57.704 --> 08:59.704
Suggests you've been
bathing in purple rain.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.573
- Come on, man! You gotta
help me get outta here.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.674
- Why are you so eager
to get out of here, anyway?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.477
So you can go back
to your fantasy life online?

09:06.513 --> 09:08.313
Meanwhile, you're out here
hurting real people

09:08.448 --> 09:10.114
With this purple rain garbage.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.784
Like those two who attacked
my colleagues in your house.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.986
- Man, you don't know me.
- True.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.988
But then there's something
you don't know about us.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.390
We found your stash.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.058
(suspenseful music)

09:22.529 --> 09:24.729
- Switch, I'm gonna put this
in terms

09:24.864 --> 09:26.230
That maybe you'll appreciate...

09:27.267 --> 09:28.699
It's game over.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.069
(scoffs)
- unless...

09:31.871 --> 09:33.337
You're willing to play.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.545
- I wasn't lying, I don't know
who the supplier is.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.348
I picked up the drugs
from a lock box.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.617
I only communicated with them
through battlebender.

09:45.619 --> 09:49.087
- Which has just been shut down.
- Thanks to you.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.889
- And you have no idea how
the drugs are being sold now?

09:51.925 --> 09:52.857
- Nope.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.099
- You know who's great
at finding drug dealers?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.234
Drug addicts.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.369
Let's go talk
to one of those zombies.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.407
- Name's goldy bouchard.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.709
And you're not the first cops

10:10.844 --> 10:12.910
To ever call looking
for my grandson.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.579
So what do you want
with him this time?

10:14.581 --> 10:15.780
- We'd rather speak
directly with him.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.114
- What about?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.783
- With all due respect,
I don't think you'd know

10:18.785 --> 10:19.918
Anything about this.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.918
- Try me.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.259
- See the marks
on these handles?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.863
These guns have been turning up
a lot in the grasslands lately.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.731
- Trigger hasn't been
in the grasslands

10:33.867 --> 10:35.132
Since he got out.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.668
Not even to visit me.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.739
He moved to oakville
with his girlfriend, got a job,

10:40.874 --> 10:43.074
The little one on the way...

10:43.110 --> 10:45.677
He's really turned things
around this time, finally.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.944
Besides...

10:48.181 --> 10:50.882
Trigger wouldn't go near
these shoddy pieces of crap.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.951
- What do you know about guns?

10:52.953 --> 10:55.019
- I'm a retired gunsmith.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.355
When it comes to guns,
I know a lot.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.058
- Listen, I think it's great
that you think trigger

11:00.060 --> 11:03.161
Has really turned things around.
Unfortunately, we have no reason

11:03.163 --> 11:04.429
To feel the same.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.498
Wazowski, looks like
we're going to oakville.

11:06.633 --> 11:07.732
- No, no, wait.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.568
Yuppies may be taking
over the grassland,

11:10.637 --> 11:13.370
But I'm part of the foundation.

11:14.474 --> 11:17.442
No one minds much
what they say around me.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.278
What if I knew where
the guns were being sold?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.118
- Then we might not need
to go to oakville.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.796
So goldy says that
whoever's selling the guns

11:38.865 --> 11:40.398
Are working out of this plaza.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.300
We just have to sniff out
the dealer.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.070
- Finally!

11:46.807 --> 11:47.839
Officers.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.808
- Uh, detective
samantha wazowski,

11:50.877 --> 11:52.076
Detective kelly duff.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.978
- Detectives! This is good.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.147
You should be able to help me.
Osmund omiri.

11:56.216 --> 12:00.084
Uh, my uncle left this plaza
to me in his will last year.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.285
Friends call me oz.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.586
- Nice to meet you, mr. Amiri.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.489
- I'm sorry, what, uh,
seems to be the problem?

12:04.558 --> 12:08.092
- So, this woman emails me
about leasing that space.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.963
Says she rented it
for years from my uncle

12:11.965 --> 12:13.430
For a summer church camp.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.967
So we finalized the seasonal
contract over email.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.236
Next thing I know,
I'm getting complaints

12:18.238 --> 12:19.971
From other leasers
about the noise.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.640
And I'm on the next flight
out of san diego

12:22.642 --> 12:24.175
On day two of comicon.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.845
- And what exactly, uh,
do you want us to do?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.979
- I need action!
Charge them so I can get out

12:29.015 --> 12:30.448
Of this fraudulent agreement.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.982
- Yeah, we're not here
for petty noise complaints,

12:32.018 --> 12:33.117
Mr. Amiri.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.586
We're looking into real
criminal activity

12:35.655 --> 12:37.188
In your plaza.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.524
- Have you seen any guns
in your premises?

12:39.659 --> 12:41.192
- I've never seen a gun
in my life.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.726
Are you telling me
I could get shot?

12:42.763 --> 12:44.528
- Please, please, calm down.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.264
We're just here
to ask you a few questions.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.565
- Well, if you're looking
for law breakers,

12:47.700 --> 12:49.067
I'd start there.
And if I were you,

12:49.202 --> 12:51.336
I would do it soon.
I have your names,

12:51.471 --> 12:55.139
I will call your superior
officer person, so...

12:55.942 --> 12:57.075
- Okay.
- Wow.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.009
- Point taken.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.377
- Wow.
- Um, I would rather write

13:00.413 --> 13:02.947
Reports for ballard all day
than ever help that guy.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.081
- Right?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.017
- So where do you want to start?
- Uh...

13:07.554 --> 13:08.887
Church camp?
- Okay.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.154
- But I prefer to go in alone,

13:10.223 --> 13:11.556
Let the people warm up to me

13:11.691 --> 13:13.224
Before I start asking them
about guns,

13:13.260 --> 13:14.626
Know what I'm saying?
- I get you.

13:14.628 --> 13:15.827
I got you.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.895
I'll start at the other
end of the plaza.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.631
(upbeat reggae music)

13:33.113 --> 13:34.979
- Welcome to preppy carnival.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.581
I'm the owner, anne-marie.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.849
Have you ever been
in caribana before?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.917
- No. I've always
wanted to though.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.386
(chuckling)

13:41.388 --> 13:43.187
I'm always working that weekend.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.655
- Let's change that.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.457
- Mm-hmm!
- Where have you been?

13:46.459 --> 13:47.925
(chuckling)
don't fret.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.861
I have the perfect
costume for you.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.662
- Yes? Yes!
- Yes! Follow me.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.599
- So I can go chippin'
down the road!

13:55.702 --> 13:58.135
- Now the wings are an extra
hundred dollars,

13:58.137 --> 14:01.805
But trust me, frontline
is the only way to go.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.041
You're paying
for the experience.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.810
Oh, it's looking real good.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.612
I just wanted you to get a feel.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.683
- Oh, I am feeling
myself in this.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.618
- Alright. Hold on...

14:13.620 --> 14:15.953
Your necklace is just
getting in the way.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.755
(tense music)

14:17.891 --> 14:19.056
You're a cop?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.292
(sighs)

14:22.462 --> 14:24.128
(door buzzing)

14:24.264 --> 14:25.829
(popping chewing gum)

14:28.368 --> 14:30.435
- Wow, you're really
good at that.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.435
Gum-cracking.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.736
- Oh, I'm good at everything.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.639
(chuckling)

14:34.641 --> 14:35.639
What's this about?

14:36.443 --> 14:37.708
- Purple rain,

14:37.744 --> 14:38.977
The stuff we found
by your shirt

14:38.979 --> 14:41.445
When you were dancing topless
in trinity bellwoods.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.582
- I mean, hey,
that's legal in ontario!

14:45.485 --> 14:46.984
Not like I remember it, though.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.588
I was riding a real high.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.391
Well, I-I know you guys
are cops,

14:54.427 --> 14:56.927
But like, you should try it.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.896
It's not for amateurs.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.366
But when your body
gets used to it, wow.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.470
- Yeah, that's a great
sales pitch.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.138
But people are actually
overdosing.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.539
They're dying.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.175
- The amateurs.
- Right.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.080
So, now that we've established
you're a pro at taking drugs,

15:16.082 --> 15:18.416
Maybe you can help us figure out
where they're getting 'em from.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.317
- Come on, why would I do that?

15:21.821 --> 15:24.088
I mean, you guys got me on what,
a dime bag?

15:25.392 --> 15:27.224
It's not my first drug charge.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.228
- I guess, what, you'd rather us
tail you everywhere you go

15:30.363 --> 15:32.696
To find out who
you're buying from? That way?

15:32.732 --> 15:33.998
- Good luck.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.367
Switch was my connect.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.770
Not for lack of trying,
but purple rain is tough

15:38.905 --> 15:40.270
To come by on a corner.

15:41.875 --> 15:44.708
The people dealing it
are outcasts.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.845
Nerds. Gamers.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.716
Nobodies.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.019
And the thing about nobodies,

15:55.155 --> 15:56.921
They aren't on anyone's radar.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.924
They're practically invisible.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.827
Can I go now?

16:03.863 --> 16:05.330
- Actually yeah, sure.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.334
Can I get my baggie back?
(chuckling)

16:10.403 --> 16:11.635
- Not a chance.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.607
- So how long
have you been open for?

16:16.609 --> 16:17.875
- About three months.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.277
It's only a matter of time

16:19.412 --> 16:21.279
Before we open
a second location.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.349
Especially with spencer
in my corner.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.286
- Hi, uh, detective wazowski.

16:28.922 --> 16:29.987
- Spencer taylor.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.290
What can I help you with,
detective?

16:32.292 --> 16:34.124
- We've just been noticing some
guns popping up in the area,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.893
I'm wondering if you've noticed
any criminal activity

16:35.929 --> 16:37.094
In and around the plaza?

16:37.230 --> 16:38.395
(chuckling)

16:38.431 --> 16:40.564
- Well, the only crime
I've witnessed

16:40.600 --> 16:43.967
Is the non-stop noise
coming from over there.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.003
It's bad for business.
- Love the culture.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.573
It's just so noisy.

16:48.708 --> 16:49.907
(phone vibrating)

16:49.976 --> 16:51.375
(sighs)
- it was, uh,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.143
Nice to meet you, detective.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.047
- What's his deal?
- He's a visionary entrepreneur

16:56.116 --> 16:57.848
With radical ideas.

16:57.884 --> 17:01.318
Like, okay, right now,
he's supplying my juice bar

17:01.354 --> 17:03.254
With discarded fruits
from his brother's farm

17:03.256 --> 17:04.321
In central valley.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.190
(gags)
get it?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.592
Junk juice.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.527
Juice...

17:09.529 --> 17:12.330
(gags)
- I get it. So...

17:12.465 --> 17:14.732
- I was gonna tell you
when I came in,

17:14.867 --> 17:18.068
But then you started talking
about the costumes and...

17:19.406 --> 17:21.806
I didn't mean for you
to find out like that.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.208
And I'm not here
about the music,

17:24.244 --> 17:27.745
Although mr. Amiri did think
this was a church camp.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.414
- That boy is nothing
like his uncle.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.615
Rest his soul.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.619
No appreciation for culture.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.221
I said I was running a mas camp

17:37.356 --> 17:41.024
Where masqueraders come
and buy their costumes for mas,

17:41.061 --> 17:43.561
Aka carnival, aka caribana.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.696
- It was a misunderstanding.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.499
- I've been running my operation
out of this plaza

17:48.535 --> 17:51.368
From April to August for years.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.038
And this is the first time
I'm getting a noise complaint.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.439
(kissing teeth)

17:55.508 --> 17:58.776
- Did you say you've been open
around two months?

17:58.911 --> 17:59.744
(gunshot)

17:59.879 --> 18:01.345
(screaming)

18:01.347 --> 18:03.380
Move! Move!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.787
- Call an ambulance!

18:12.592 --> 18:13.524
- You okay?

18:14.394 --> 18:15.826
- I'm shot, what do you think?

18:15.829 --> 18:18.295
- He's okay.
- Oh my god, spencer.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.867
(suspenseful music)

18:24.504 --> 18:25.736
- Stop!

18:30.009 --> 18:31.609
(panting)

18:33.646 --> 18:35.245
(crowd muttering angrily)

18:40.720 --> 18:43.120
Move! Move, move!

18:43.123 --> 18:46.256
- Hey, hey, officer,
he's in the trunk.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.569
- Show me your hands.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.580
- The doctor said
it was a clean hit.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.182
Straight through and through.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.516
Can't say you're not lucky.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.185
- Can't say that I am.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.786
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.321
- Oh, it's evidence.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.990
- Do you want to tell us
what happened?

19:21.126 --> 19:23.661
- One moment I'm upright,
heading to my car.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.729
The next, I'm on my ass.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.466
- We've gathered as much,
but anything else?

19:28.601 --> 19:29.867
Was there anyone around you?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.469
- Obviously there was.
But I didn't see them.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.205
- Okay, um...

19:34.207 --> 19:35.806
Do you know why anyone
would target you?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.276
Like, did you have any words
with anyone at junk juice?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.544
- Or anyone else from another
business at the plaza?

19:40.547 --> 19:43.047
- Sure, I-I carped about
the music

19:43.182 --> 19:46.350
At the church camp sometimes
but mostly to oz.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.552
(grunts)
wait, are you...

19:48.555 --> 19:50.221
Are you victim blaming?
- No, what?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.823
We're just trying to establish
motive, like gather facts.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.360
- Look, I appreciate it.
I wish I could help you,

19:56.362 --> 19:57.695
But I've told you
everything I know.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.765
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get some rest.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.967
(groans)

20:03.102 --> 20:04.034
- Okay.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.104
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.242
- Ugh, firearm requalification
always kind of creeps up on you,

20:11.311 --> 20:14.044
Doesn't it? But I'm so glad
that I get to do it with you.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.846
- In 25 years,

20:15.915 --> 20:17.781
Have I ever missed
the opportunity

20:17.850 --> 20:19.783
To beat you at anything?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.885
- Not everything
is a competition, gloria.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.455
- But isn't it so much
more fun when it is?

20:27.026 --> 20:27.991
- Oh!
- Yes!

20:29.729 --> 20:31.662
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.664
Oh, you win some, I win some.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.065
(chuckling)

20:35.101 --> 20:36.566
- The line is no longer safe.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.269
(buzzing)

20:43.076 --> 20:45.376
(gunshots)

20:48.481 --> 20:50.348
- Hm, not bad for someone
who hasn't been

20:50.483 --> 20:51.949
On the beat for 15 years.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.285
- Okay, I'd like to see
you do better.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.552
(snaps fingers)

21:01.427 --> 21:02.392
Oof!

21:03.596 --> 21:04.962
- I didn't have lunch.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.330
- That's not all you missed.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.039
Four in the black.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.308
(buzzing)

21:17.310 --> 21:19.844
- The line is safe,
moving forward to check targets.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.313
- Wow.

21:23.649 --> 21:28.119
Look at you doing so well

21:28.254 --> 21:30.488
Just soaring above it all.

21:31.591 --> 21:35.258
- Does that bug you?
- No, of course not.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.595
Rising tides raise all boats
for us gals, remember?

21:38.665 --> 21:40.931
- Mm-hmm, so then why
are you trying to sink

21:40.933 --> 21:42.466
Some of the boats on your team?

21:42.502 --> 21:44.401
- What? What the hell
are you talking about?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.203
- Sam and kelly...
- Oh, my god.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.671
- You keep sending them
on scavenger hunts.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.073
- Not scavenger hunts.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.676
I have a pile of
unsolved cases on my desk,

21:52.745 --> 21:55.546
Many of which were there
when it was your desk,

21:55.615 --> 21:57.681
I might add.
They're doing good work.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.417
- Yeah, but it's not the work
they should be doing.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.354
Look, I think I know
what this is about.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.523
I reinstated sam and kelly
without consulting you first.

22:07.893 --> 22:10.494
And I know that you're also up
for the superintendent job,

22:10.496 --> 22:12.463
So I get it, I-I get it.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.498
- When we were coming up,

22:14.567 --> 22:18.435
We could not make a call
without some man stepping in,

22:18.504 --> 22:20.237
Telling us how to do our job.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.173
You know what? I'm... I am fine

22:23.209 --> 22:24.842
With you getting
the position over me,

22:24.911 --> 22:26.243
I can deal with that,

22:26.245 --> 22:27.644
Especially with the way
things are now.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.115
I mean, this is your time...
I get that.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.117
What I can't deal with

22:33.252 --> 22:36.053
Is you using that position
to minimize mine.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.321
Just like the guys used to do.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.392
- I'm not sure why you're trying
to equate our struggles

22:41.461 --> 22:43.660
When it's crystal clear to me

22:43.662 --> 22:46.797
That you haven't forgotten
that I'm a black woman.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.131
(door opens)

22:49.268 --> 22:50.367
Oh...

22:51.204 --> 22:52.736
This one's mine.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.807
It's my time now.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.542
(laughing)

22:58.544 --> 23:00.411
Oh, gloria.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.147
You know what?

23:03.282 --> 23:05.750
We could compare
resumes all day.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.152
I think we both know

23:08.221 --> 23:10.354
That it would take a lot
longer to read mine.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.360
(sighs)

23:18.364 --> 23:20.897
- Okay, leandre sealy, 23.

23:20.933 --> 23:24.501
He moved from saint lucia
to canada three years ago...

23:24.570 --> 23:26.170
To study visual arts,
is that right?

23:28.508 --> 23:31.041
- You became a permanent
resident not too long ago?

23:32.311 --> 23:34.778
- Unfortunately, it makes things
a lot harder for you.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.081
Pr status means you're not
just looking at time,

23:37.083 --> 23:39.049
But also deportation.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.789
- Did you ever see that man?

23:46.025 --> 23:47.792
- Yeah, I did... I did see
him around the plaza.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.393
- Have you ever spoken to him?
(scoffs)

23:49.462 --> 23:50.994
- No, that man seems
like an idiot.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.063
- Is that why you shot him?
- Eh, eh?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.065
So what, do you just go around
shooting idiots?

23:55.134 --> 23:57.334
- Listen, I'm not the one
that fled the scene of a crime.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.003
- And I doesn't walk around
with a gun, officer.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.537
- Okay. Okay.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.739
We're just trying
to figure out what happened.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.210
What were you doing
back there anyway?

24:06.345 --> 24:08.879
- I was organizing
mas camp supplies.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.681
I take a break from it
to go and pee.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.649
- Did you see anything?

24:12.685 --> 24:15.352
- As I'm fixing my pants,
I hear that idiot on the phone.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.154
Next thing you know,
I hear a bang.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.656
So like any normal person,
I go and duck behind a car.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.492
- Why did you run?

24:22.829 --> 24:24.761
- You know, I may have only
been here a few years,

24:24.797 --> 24:26.563
But it didn't take me long
to see how you officers

24:26.599 --> 24:27.898
Look at me.

24:28.033 --> 24:30.701
Guilty until proven innocent.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.935
That true, officers?

24:34.073 --> 24:36.373
I ain't saying another word
until my lawyer reach there.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.444
- You think he's telling
the truth?

24:41.481 --> 24:42.980
- I don't know.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.714
I can't figure out his motive.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.184
And for someone in the hot seat,
he's playing it really cool.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.719
- Agreed.
(sighs)

24:48.788 --> 24:50.120
But there's one way to be sure.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.723
We follow the evidence.
We have the bullet.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.992
- Gotta find the gun.
The team's searching right now.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.260
- Hm.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.928
So let's retrace his steps.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.135
- Did you get anything
out of that chat with lynn?

25:05.204 --> 25:06.870
- Ugh, not really, no.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.807
Except, we need to think
like a nerd

25:09.942 --> 25:11.608
To figure out where
we should be looking.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.209
(indistinct chatter)

25:13.246 --> 25:15.279
(chase): My lord, you have
left me no choice

25:15.414 --> 25:18.415
For your disgrace of the king,
I will maim you with my lance.

25:18.451 --> 25:20.817
(watts): Thine chivalry
knows no boundaries.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.886
- What the hell
are they talking about?

25:22.955 --> 25:25.756
- That, my friend,
is nerd speak.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.624
(chase): I want your blood,
sir watts.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.893
(both grunting)

25:30.963 --> 25:32.963
Ah! No!

25:33.032 --> 25:34.565
(shouting)

25:34.700 --> 25:36.567
(choking)

25:38.437 --> 25:39.570
- You guys, uh...

25:39.705 --> 25:41.237
Having some fun
with your food there?

25:41.274 --> 25:42.439
- Just clowning around.
- Yeah.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.241
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.242
- Yeah.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.777
- Uh, how'd it go
at the hospital?

25:46.846 --> 25:47.912
Did you find out anything?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.079
- Not much, no,

25:49.081 --> 25:50.447
Although whoever's dealing
to those kids

25:50.516 --> 25:51.782
Is smarter than switch.

25:51.851 --> 25:54.117
- Students did find their drugs
through battlebender

25:54.186 --> 25:55.653
Until it got shut down,

25:55.655 --> 25:57.454
But they didn't meet up to pay.

25:57.490 --> 25:59.323
Instead,
they e-transferred money

25:59.392 --> 26:01.058
Through to weird
email addresses.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.994
And get this,
contactless pick-ups.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.463
Nobody seems to know
who they're buying from.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.665
- Yeah, and they say
post-secondary education

26:08.701 --> 26:10.134
Is a scam.
(chuckles)

26:10.269 --> 26:11.135
- Cool, cool.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.803
Well, we just wanted to, um...

26:12.805 --> 26:13.804
Pick your brain about something.

26:13.873 --> 26:14.938
- Same, we actually wanted

26:14.941 --> 26:16.073
To ask you guys for some advice

26:16.208 --> 26:18.475
Because most of these kids
seem to be dorks like you.

26:18.511 --> 26:19.609
- Yeah.

26:19.645 --> 26:20.810
- Excuse me?
- You know,

26:20.846 --> 26:22.513
Do-gooders, brown-nosers,

26:22.648 --> 26:24.581
Bootlickers, cow towers,
suck-ups.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.551
- Yeah, the opposite of us.
More in line with... Dorks.

26:27.553 --> 26:28.485
- Dorks.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.487
- You think we're dorks?

26:30.623 --> 26:31.888
- Mm... Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.423
(scoffs)
- wha...

26:33.492 --> 26:34.924
Who here is a larper?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.160
- My point exactly.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.496
- No, no, that's my point
exactly.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.498
- You seriously think
we're the bigger nerds here?

26:41.534 --> 26:43.466
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes! Of course!

26:43.502 --> 26:44.835
- Just looking at you.
Obviously, yeah.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.837
- Absolutely.
You're so serious.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.038
- Yeah.
- You never laugh.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.306
- We make jokes.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.573
- Yeah, dorky jokes!

26:50.610 --> 26:52.643
- Pfft! You think you can
do any better?

26:52.645 --> 26:54.511
Time for a joke-off.
- Yeah, lay one on us, dorks.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.447
You think you can make us laugh?
'cause I bet you can't.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.081
Ain't gonna happen, watch.
- Oh, god...

26:58.117 --> 26:59.450
- Alright, geeks!
- No, no, don't, please.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.884
- Knock, knock.
(both): Who's there?

27:00.953 --> 27:01.985
- Okay, stop.

27:02.722 --> 27:03.720
Please, a riveting debate

27:03.789 --> 27:05.255
That could go on endlessly,
I'm sure,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.524
But I have some news about
that woman you two interviewed

27:07.526 --> 27:08.659
A couple of hours ago.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.828
- Lynn. We didn't get
very much workable intel,

27:10.830 --> 27:12.195
But we're working on putting
something together--

27:12.264 --> 27:13.530
- She was just found dead.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.667
She overdosed on those
purple crystals.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.403
So...

27:20.539 --> 27:22.873
How about we just accept
that we're all nerds,

27:22.942 --> 27:24.808
Equal but different,
and figure out

27:24.943 --> 27:26.610
Where this stuff is coming from?

27:27.413 --> 27:28.278
Alright?

27:29.148 --> 27:30.180
- Commander.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.850
If it's becoming that serious,
maybe we should...

27:35.254 --> 27:37.287
Let sam and kelly join us
on this investigation.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.488
We need 'em.

27:39.692 --> 27:40.824
(tense music)

27:47.266 --> 27:48.999
(indistinct chatter)

27:50.436 --> 27:51.334
- Hey, kelly!

27:52.371 --> 27:53.904
I mean, detective.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.039
- She's good, let her through.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.041
- What?

27:58.044 --> 28:00.577
A white boy takes a bullet
behind my mas camp

28:00.613 --> 28:01.845
And I have to shut down?

28:01.847 --> 28:03.347
- I can understand
your frustration,

28:03.349 --> 28:04.681
But leeandre
fled the scene through here,

28:04.816 --> 28:06.583
We have to search it.

28:06.619 --> 28:08.719
- The only way
this mas camp functions

28:08.721 --> 28:11.622
Is with the help of volunteers
like leeandre,

28:11.757 --> 28:13.290
Who's been helping me
with my supplies

28:13.292 --> 28:16.326
Since he came to canada.
He ain't no criminal!

28:16.395 --> 28:18.695
Just because he's a black man--
- whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:18.731 --> 28:20.864
You don't think I get that?

28:22.201 --> 28:25.101
Look, if he's innocent,
the evidence should prove it.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.671
- But I cannot afford
to stop production

28:27.740 --> 28:29.406
For your investigation.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.008
I need to grab a few things.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.210
(sighs)

28:37.283 --> 28:40.250
- Anne-marie, I just gotta check
that before you take it out.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.419
- Why, the other officers

28:42.421 --> 28:44.087
Already tore my supply
space apart.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.056
- Please, don't make
this difficult.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.690
It will just take a few seconds.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.759
(sighs)

28:50.829 --> 28:51.928
Thank you.

28:56.602 --> 29:00.303
- See? Nothing except a few
costume supplies and so.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.844
- Sam.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.046
(scoffs)

29:10.916 --> 29:12.583
- Is that an actual gun?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.451
Was that in your church camp?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.788
- I swear, that was not
here this afternoon.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.990
(sighs)
ask the other officers.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.457
- Check out the cross
on the grip.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.726
- This came from our dealer.

29:24.797 --> 29:25.929
- Yup.
(sighs)

29:42.681 --> 29:44.381
- Can I have a word?

29:44.450 --> 29:46.182
- You'll probably need several.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.020
(sighs)

29:54.460 --> 29:57.561
- Superintendent
is my dream job.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.963
And what I said yesterday was...

30:01.133 --> 30:03.600
A band-aid for a bruised ego.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.703
Anyone looking at the evidence

30:06.739 --> 30:10.773
Can see the most qualified cop
got the job.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.509
I was wrong.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.146
And I'm sorry.

30:16.281 --> 30:18.081
- Thank you for owning that.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.985
And it's not all you,

30:22.120 --> 30:25.789
I undermined your position
when I reinstated sam and kelly.

30:25.924 --> 30:29.993
It was unfair and this is me
officially backing off.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.195
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.366
And gloria...

30:37.936 --> 30:39.937
If you mess up,
I am the one

30:39.939 --> 30:42.105
Who has to wear it
in front of the cameras.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.942
So don't make
this hottie look bad.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.409
(scoffs)

30:53.018 --> 30:54.117
- Mm.

30:55.153 --> 30:56.286
- Just looking at this
ballistics report

30:56.322 --> 30:57.620
For the mas camp gun.

30:57.656 --> 30:58.889
- Mm-hmm.
- Larry tested it,

30:59.024 --> 31:00.023
Almost shot his foot off.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.358
Says it's got a faulty
trigger pull,

31:01.427 --> 31:04.094
Under one pound,
highly sensitive.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.762
- Sounds like a typical
Saturday night special to me.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.898
Available, cheap,
and unreliable.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.532
- It's right here
in black and white.

31:09.602 --> 31:11.434
This was the gun
to shoot spencer.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.837
I mean, partial prints,
but too small for any hits.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.440
- Okay, what do we know,
what do we know?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.909
Uh, we know that...

31:20.246 --> 31:21.578
Spencer was shot with the same
type of gun that's been

31:21.580 --> 31:23.246
Showing up in the grasslands
for the past two months.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.181
Within that timeframe,
mas camp opens up,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.584
Leeandre volunteers there
ordering supplies.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.719
And the gun was found
in a supply box.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.990
- So maybe leeandre
was using the supply orders

31:33.125 --> 31:34.925
To import the guns. I mean,

31:35.060 --> 31:36.793
Anne-marie did say
majority of the materials

31:36.929 --> 31:38.328
Came from south of the border.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.063
- You know, and he did
live there for a while,

31:40.198 --> 31:42.065
So he'd know about the crosses.
Maybe he was branding the gun

31:42.134 --> 31:43.667
Strategically, but kel,
I don't know.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.369
I mean, come on, what's his
motive for shooting spencer?

31:47.940 --> 31:49.205
(sighs)
- larry says

31:49.241 --> 31:50.807
It's a defective gun.

31:50.809 --> 31:53.743
Maybe leeandre set it off
by accident?

31:54.847 --> 31:56.480
Anne-marie was so sure
he was innocent, though.

31:59.218 --> 32:00.450
(chuckles)

32:02.254 --> 32:03.754
- Maybe anne-marie was right.

32:03.756 --> 32:05.689
- What?
- Come on!

32:05.691 --> 32:06.823
I'm gonna tell you on the way.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.224
(sighs, groans)

32:08.260 --> 32:10.259
Follow me!

32:11.263 --> 32:12.495
- Like I said,
I didn't see the shooter.

32:12.564 --> 32:13.830
(sighs)
- you know, your story

32:13.966 --> 32:15.565
Remains consistent,
I'll give you that.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.634
But... There's one hole in it.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.637
(chuckling)
literally one hole in it.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.606
You mind explaining
why there's no hole

32:22.608 --> 32:24.641
In the front of your blazer?

32:24.643 --> 32:27.244
See, there's one there.
- Mm-hmm.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.579
- But not one there,
now why is that?

32:29.648 --> 32:31.414
- The shooter
got me from behind?

32:31.483 --> 32:32.515
(both): Oh.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.317
- Really?

32:34.519 --> 32:35.652
- Mm. Yes. Okay.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.588
You see, the thing is, that...

32:38.590 --> 32:40.923
Is not really
how that would work.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.059
Either the shooter's
close enough to aim the gun

32:43.128 --> 32:44.728
Into the jacket,

32:44.730 --> 32:46.796
Or you were carrying the gun
inside the jacket

32:46.832 --> 32:48.198
And you shot yourself.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.999
(laughing)

32:50.936 --> 32:53.136
- You think I shot myself?
- Mm-hmm.

32:53.806 --> 32:54.771
- Connect those dots.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.540
Wait, oh, you can't,
because it's absurd.

32:57.609 --> 32:59.476
- I actually think
it's forensics, hm?

33:00.379 --> 33:01.678
Check out those powder burns.

33:03.248 --> 33:06.350
Now, my theory is...

33:08.721 --> 33:10.620
When I asked you about
the guns, I spooked you,

33:10.622 --> 33:12.556
So you decided to leave
with the gun you had on you

33:12.558 --> 33:14.991
And you pulled that faulty
trigger by mistake.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.460
- So what...

33:18.497 --> 33:20.630
You're gonna charge me
with possession

33:20.632 --> 33:22.365
Of one barely functioning gun?

33:22.368 --> 33:25.968
- Oh no, see you're not
just connected to one gun.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.239
We have three
identical firearms

33:29.241 --> 33:31.241
That were used
in very serious crimes.

33:31.310 --> 33:33.377
And you, my friend,

33:33.512 --> 33:35.645
You own a food-importing
business,

33:35.714 --> 33:37.581
Which is a really convenient way

33:37.716 --> 33:39.716
To smuggle guns across
the border. Oh yeah, yeah.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.251
See those dots connecting?

33:41.253 --> 33:42.919
- You know, I gotta say,
burning those guns

33:42.988 --> 33:44.788
With a known grasslands
gang insignia,

33:44.790 --> 33:46.556
Ugh, that was really clever.
- Oh, my god.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.425
- You're truly a brilliant
entrepreneur, really.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.960
- Yeah, yeah. So you know,
the smartest thing

33:50.095 --> 33:52.629
You can do right now
is cooperate

33:52.698 --> 33:54.865
And tell us where
the rest of the guns are,

33:54.867 --> 33:57.300
And maybe we'll discuss a deal.

34:05.878 --> 34:07.677
(bells on door chiming)

34:07.679 --> 34:09.746
- Welcome to junk juice b--

34:11.016 --> 34:12.348
- It's over, ash.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.550
Listen, we know about
the gun stash

34:13.552 --> 34:14.684
And you helping spencer
sell them.

34:14.753 --> 34:15.952
So come on,
just give us the guns.

34:16.088 --> 34:18.088
- You don't understand,
I was just trying to bring

34:18.090 --> 34:20.290
Sustainable options
to the masses.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.825
- Okay. Ah!

34:21.827 --> 34:23.026
(grunts)

34:23.095 --> 34:24.627
(groans)

34:24.696 --> 34:26.496
(suspenseful music)

34:26.965 --> 34:27.831
- Freeze!

34:28.667 --> 34:30.300
We know you planted that gun

34:30.435 --> 34:32.702
And set up an innocent black man
to take the fall.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.870
- I panicked!

34:33.939 --> 34:35.372
- Now turn around!

34:35.507 --> 34:37.673
Turn around! Slowly.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.577
Ash, you are under arrest...

34:44.316 --> 34:45.182
(grunts)

34:48.120 --> 34:50.253
Like I said...

34:50.388 --> 34:51.921
You're under arrest. Move!

34:57.229 --> 34:59.396
(suspenseful music)

35:01.700 --> 35:05.335
- This... This whole thing,
it's unbelievable.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.870
- Which part?

35:06.872 --> 35:09.205
Your presumed innocence
of the young white entrepreneurs

35:09.241 --> 35:10.540
Who sell garbage in a cup?

35:10.675 --> 35:12.809
- Or your blatant prejudice
towards a caribbean community

35:12.811 --> 35:14.878
Just trying to celebrate
their culture?

35:14.947 --> 35:17.847
- I get it, I was wrong.
I'm embarrassed.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.483
What can I do?

35:20.486 --> 35:22.218
- Discuss reparations
in the form

35:22.287 --> 35:23.986
Of a revised lease rate.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.122
- In this market? That's...

35:26.859 --> 35:28.491
I'm not that embarrassed.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.226
I am sorry.

35:30.262 --> 35:34.564
And, uh, I'll shut up
about the noise.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.270
- Your hands
are not clean either.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.573
I told you leeandre
was innocent

35:43.708 --> 35:45.107
And that the mas camp
had nothing to do

35:45.144 --> 35:48.511
With any of this.
- And the evidence proved that.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.146
He's being released right now.

35:54.119 --> 35:55.218
(sighs)

35:56.254 --> 35:57.153
- Hey.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.556
We got two dozen illegal guns
out of the grasslands.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.960
You were a great cop today.
- Thanks.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.162
You too.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.531
Just doesn't feel that way.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.214
- Hey, happy with your ipr?

36:25.250 --> 36:27.416
- If this doesn't get us back
into purple rain,

36:27.452 --> 36:29.886
I'll start my own juice empire.
(chuckling)

36:32.290 --> 36:33.155
Night.

36:33.192 --> 36:34.424
- Night.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.092
Enjoy that bath.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.360
- You too.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.632
(sighs)

36:42.701 --> 36:45.434
- Oh, hi, commander, I was just
about to submit my ipr.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.238
- Duff, I just got
commendations from upstairs

36:49.274 --> 36:51.975
On that impressive gun bust
in the grasslands.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.379
- Care to pass them on?

36:57.349 --> 36:58.414
- I just did.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.185
- You know, I was wondering...

37:04.256 --> 37:07.257
Why you don't want us in here,
me and sam.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.259
I think it's because you
wanted your own team,

37:09.328 --> 37:12.128
Your own people,
and we were forced on you.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.666
But I promise you, we're good.

37:18.203 --> 37:20.003
And we're gonna make you
look good.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.938
Because honestly...

37:24.743 --> 37:25.875
(sighs)

37:25.944 --> 37:27.410
...We really care.

37:28.513 --> 37:31.047
But don't take my word for it.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.352
Look at the evidence.

37:39.925 --> 37:40.957
- Kelly.

37:43.195 --> 37:44.393
Noted.

37:45.864 --> 37:46.996
- Thanks.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.068
(soft music)

37:57.676 --> 37:59.576
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.312
- Something smells good.

38:02.314 --> 38:04.481
- Yeah, I showered. Finally.
(chuckling)

38:04.483 --> 38:06.115
- Well, you know what,
I guess there's an upside

38:06.151 --> 38:08.051
To being jobless. I mean,
you're home all the time.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.585
- Oh, yeah. Well, to be fair,

38:09.655 --> 38:10.920
I still cooked
when I was working.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.289
- Yeah. But you smell better.
- Exactly.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.991
And I wasn't the same
financial burden.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.092
- Stop.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.561
- Here, try this.
- Okay.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.598
Oh, wow.
- Right?

38:21.733 --> 38:22.932
- Yeah, that's really good.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.605
- I'm just gonna say this, um...

38:31.343 --> 38:34.777
Lately, I can feel...
You pulling away.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.545
- What do you mean?

38:36.581 --> 38:38.081
- Ever since I took
a leave of work...

38:39.551 --> 38:40.416
You've been distant.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.951
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.019
It's not work, it's...

38:44.623 --> 38:45.588
I don't know.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.691
Steve, last year
was a really big year.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.360
Like, elliot left...

38:50.362 --> 38:52.095
I got demoted, that sucked.

38:54.333 --> 38:57.733
Then kelly was gone
and you were there.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.703
You're amazing.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.372
You're like this rock.
And then you introduced me

39:02.374 --> 39:04.174
To ro, and that was,
it was perfect.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.575
- So what's changed?

39:11.216 --> 39:12.715
- I don't know.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.251
Nothing? I don't know, maybe...

39:15.253 --> 39:16.853
Something? It's just,
do you ever feel

39:16.922 --> 39:18.320
Like maybe it could be just...

39:18.357 --> 39:20.790
Did you move in...
Did we do this too soon?

39:20.826 --> 39:23.226
- Even if we did,
that doesn't mean it's wrong.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.261
Things are still settling.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.664
You said when you needed me,
I was your rock.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.868
You might not always need a rock
every second of the day.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.002
And when you don't need a rock,

39:33.071 --> 39:34.537
A rock can be
pretty boring, yeah?

39:34.573 --> 39:35.872
(chuckles)

39:35.874 --> 39:37.607
Life is hard, sam.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.377
Maybe knowing the rock
is here...

39:42.347 --> 39:43.279
Can be a good thing.

39:43.415 --> 39:44.847
- It's a good thing.

39:45.617 --> 39:46.816
It's a great thing.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.419
I just don't feel like...

39:50.389 --> 39:52.822
I'm that good
of a rock for you.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.224
- Baby, I don't need a rock.

39:54.359 --> 39:56.259
I need a wedge.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.693
(laughing)
something that can get

39:57.763 --> 39:58.628
This rock to roll.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.829
(snorting)

39:59.964 --> 40:01.097
Was that good
or was that cheesy?

40:01.099 --> 40:02.632
- I feel like it was good.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.501
It was cheesy good,
it was pretty...

40:04.503 --> 40:07.170
You were good, cheesy good.
- Alright, well this cheesy rock

40:07.305 --> 40:08.705
Is thinking about going back
to work tomorrow.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.106
- What?
- How's that sound? Yeah.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.507
- Really?
- Back to work.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.644
- I'm so proud of you.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.215
Oh, you smell that?
- Yeah.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.385
- It's a... It's like a celery
smoothie on my...

40:22.454 --> 40:23.920
- Oh...
- But I didn't...

40:23.922 --> 40:25.321
It was poured onto the...
- Right.

40:25.457 --> 40:26.789
- But I should probably...
- Yeah, sure.

40:26.858 --> 40:27.857
- Gonna...
- Yeah.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.392
It didn't come from them,
it was poured on...

40:29.527 --> 40:30.659
- I'm gonna change.
- Okay, cool.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.994
I'll get the stuff on the table.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.363
- Second night without brix.

40:34.399 --> 40:35.431
- Hm.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.367
- How you feeling?

40:39.671 --> 40:41.537
- I really do miss him,
you know?

40:41.673 --> 40:44.006
We were starting to get into
a groove there for a minute.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.408
- Mm-hmm.

40:45.543 --> 40:46.642
Yeah, we were.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.145
- I'm gonna tell you what,
though.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.947
Last night's sleep, best ever.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.349
- Mm...
(chuckling)

40:53.351 --> 40:54.416
- Hm?

40:57.589 --> 40:58.688
Hm...

40:58.690 --> 41:00.356
- It did get me thinking,
though.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.025
You know, me being
gone for eight months

41:03.061 --> 41:04.627
And with brix around...

41:05.897 --> 41:09.165
You and I never really
got a chance to talk about us.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.701
- Well, let's
make up for it now.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.769
We can play a game
of 21 questions.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.304
No limits.

41:15.340 --> 41:16.706
I'll even let you go first.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.042
- Why do I feel like I'm gonna
regret this later?

41:19.044 --> 41:20.042
(chuckling)

41:21.480 --> 41:24.113
Okay. Ooh.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.817
Have you ever had
your heart broken?

41:29.787 --> 41:30.719
- No.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.255
- Oh.
- Except by you.

41:32.324 --> 41:33.455
- Oh.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.593
- It's my turn.

41:38.530 --> 41:39.795
Move in with me.

41:40.799 --> 41:41.731
Question mark.

41:41.800 --> 41:43.198
- Are you playing?

41:43.235 --> 41:45.467
You know I was always planning
on buying my own place.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.670
- I know.
But you said it yourself,

41:47.672 --> 41:49.739
We got a good thing going,
let's keep it going.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.408
And then,
if and when we're ready,

41:52.544 --> 41:54.878
We can go in on
a bigger place together.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.245
- Hm.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.484
I'm intrigued.

42:01.486 --> 42:03.385
- I'm intriguing.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.755
- Yeah.
(knocking)

42:06.791 --> 42:08.124
Oh, my god,

42:08.193 --> 42:11.627
That's probably karina
coming back already.

42:11.763 --> 42:14.897
See. I tried to tell her
it was too soon

42:14.966 --> 42:16.031
To be going back to work.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.767
- Okay.
- Nathan!

42:17.769 --> 42:18.835
- Oh, tueli!

42:18.837 --> 42:20.770
- Oh, tueli.
- Hi.

42:20.839 --> 42:22.938
- Oh, hi, yeah.
I'm his step-daughter.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.475
- Step-daughter?
- Well, uh, rewind on that...

42:25.610 --> 42:29.178
Tueli, her mother and I
lived together for seven years,

42:29.180 --> 42:31.180
But it was more
of a big brother situation.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.982
Child has a mind of her own.

42:33.018 --> 42:34.384
Never listened to me.

42:34.386 --> 42:36.786
Tueli, this is kelly.
- Hey, kelly.

42:36.921 --> 42:40.089
Nathan told me if I ever needed
anything I could come over.

42:40.091 --> 42:42.725
So, pipe burst
in my residence room.

42:42.727 --> 42:43.960
(chuckling nervously)

42:44.029 --> 42:45.795
Can I stay for a few days?

42:45.930 --> 42:47.062
Is that cool?

42:47.098 --> 42:48.998
You said you had a big
loft by yourself.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.000
- Yes, I did say that,
but kelly--

42:51.036 --> 42:52.335
- Kelly doesn't mind.

42:53.538 --> 42:54.870
What you gonna do,
leave a university student

42:54.940 --> 42:56.005
To sleep on a park bench?

42:56.041 --> 42:58.874
- No. No.
- Of course you can stay.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.613
Mm-hmm.
- Give me your bag!

43:03.748 --> 43:05.682
Let me show you your room.
- Thank you.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.616
It's heavy.
- I got it.

43:07.652 --> 43:08.618
- You got it?

43:08.753 --> 43:10.019
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:10.088 --> 43:12.355
(chuckling)

43:14.025 --> 43:15.958
Subtitling: Difuze
