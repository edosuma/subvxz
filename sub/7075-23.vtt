WEBVTT

00:05.604 --> 00:07.188
- I see you, chubby ass!
- Oh!

00:07.256 --> 00:08.789
- I ain't chasing, chubby.
- No, no, no!

00:08.840 --> 00:10.024
- Chubby-chaser.
- No!

00:10.092 --> 00:11.259
You can't outrun me.
I see you, fat-ass!

00:16.231 --> 00:17.481
Guys?

00:17.566 --> 00:19.934
Please, okay?
I don't even have a gun.

00:20.002 --> 00:20.985
Isn't this against the rules?

00:21.069 --> 00:23.237
There's only one rule,
Fat Neil.

00:23.305 --> 00:26.674
The prize goes
to the last man standing.

00:26.742 --> 00:27.675
So to speak.

00:29.011 --> 00:30.544
You--

00:32.414 --> 00:35.650
If you were a dude,
I'd have my fist up your balls.

00:40.289 --> 00:41.222
Thank you, Annie.

00:41.289 --> 00:44.458
Kick their guns to me.

00:44.526 --> 00:46.193
Kick--don't reach.

00:46.261 --> 00:47.695
Hey!

00:47.763 --> 00:49.397
Christina "Reach-y",

00:49.464 --> 00:51.232
I said kick.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.801
Annie, take it easy.

00:53.852 --> 00:56.470
You gotta learn
to trust people.

01:00.242 --> 01:02.510
Can't you leave me
with a little something?

01:02.577 --> 01:04.361
We're friends, Annie.

01:04.446 --> 01:06.614
Remember?

01:06.682 --> 01:08.349
We played Dungeons & Dragons together.

01:08.417 --> 01:10.418
That was a game.

01:13.822 --> 01:14.822
This is paintball.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.671 --> 02:04.905
Okay,
a couple of announcements.

02:04.973 --> 02:07.558
I want to thank Pistol Patty's
Cowboy Creamery

02:07.642 --> 02:09.744
for sponsoring
our end-of-the-year picnic.

02:09.811 --> 02:11.912
Now.

02:11.980 --> 02:13.647
Free ice cream and that one guy

02:13.715 --> 02:15.182
having a heart attack

02:15.250 --> 02:17.401
aren't the only surprises today.

02:17.486 --> 02:20.087
We're gonna end this year
with a quick game

02:20.155 --> 02:22.123
of Paintball Assassin.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.407
Yeah.

02:23.492 --> 02:25.960
Last year's big mistake

02:26.028 --> 02:28.095
was way too valuable a prize.

02:28.163 --> 02:29.930
And I've been assured--

02:29.998 --> 02:31.082
Eh?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.733
That this year
will be different.

02:32.801 --> 02:37.071
So take it away, Pistol Patty!

02:37.139 --> 02:38.906
Howdy, folks.

02:38.974 --> 02:40.274
There's only one rule.

02:40.342 --> 02:42.777
Last man standing
gets the prize.

02:42.844 --> 02:46.080
There's your guns.

02:46.131 --> 02:48.432
And here's the prize.

02:48.517 --> 02:51.852
$100,000 cash.

02:53.755 --> 02:55.356
Go nuts!

03:21.049 --> 03:23.050
I heard a rumor you never
shoot an unarmed man.

03:23.118 --> 03:24.885
Whoever started that rumor
didn't eat my beans.

03:24.953 --> 03:27.188
Then I guess it's lucky for me
I'm not unarmed.

03:30.258 --> 03:33.594
Seeing as I'm...

03:33.662 --> 03:36.797
Eating your beans.

03:39.134 --> 03:40.234
Jeff wants to see you.

03:40.302 --> 03:42.269
Yeah?
And I want pants.

03:42.337 --> 03:43.537
A lot of people
want a lot of things.

03:43.605 --> 03:44.738
It won't hurt
to hear him out, will it?

03:44.806 --> 03:46.707
We got a good hiding spot
in the library.

03:46.775 --> 03:49.410
As safe as you are here,
you'll be safer with us.

03:52.864 --> 03:54.515
Look.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.316
Math club's gotten a lot
better since last year.

03:56.368 --> 03:57.751
Obviously, they were practicing

03:57.819 --> 03:59.653
while the rest of us
went on dates.

04:01.223 --> 04:03.624
Hold on.
I have a plan.

04:03.675 --> 04:04.792
Math club!

04:04.843 --> 04:05.926
Yeah.

04:05.994 --> 04:07.561
I'm Asian.

04:07.629 --> 04:09.597
You guys Asian?

04:09.664 --> 04:11.532
That's pretty racist, man.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.033
That wasn't a no.

04:13.101 --> 04:14.702
I'm coming over!

04:14.769 --> 04:15.886
Don't shoot me, shoot him.

04:15.971 --> 04:17.438
He's white,
and he's out of ammo.

04:17.505 --> 04:20.190
Crap.

04:36.191 --> 04:37.558
Shoot Chang!

04:37.626 --> 04:39.243
He defected to the math club.

04:39.327 --> 04:41.528
- Math club!
- Agh.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.547
Forget it.

04:43.632 --> 04:44.798
Just a waste of ammo.

04:44.866 --> 04:46.066
Let's go grab their paint.

04:46.134 --> 04:49.103
Yeah, I'm much safer
with you guys.

04:49.171 --> 04:50.104
M'lady.

04:50.172 --> 04:51.672
What do you want, Jeff?

04:51.723 --> 04:53.040
Yikes.
Well, what do we all want?

04:53.091 --> 04:54.375
Ammo.

04:54.442 --> 04:55.476
How much you got left?

04:55.544 --> 04:56.810
$100,000 worth.

04:56.878 --> 04:57.811
Yeah, we're running low, too.

04:57.879 --> 04:58.946
- Shut up, Abed.
- Okay.

04:59.014 --> 05:00.781
What have you heard
about Pierce?

05:00.849 --> 05:02.616
I hear he's still alive,

05:02.684 --> 05:03.817
holed up near the cafeteria.

05:03.885 --> 05:05.019
Well, I hear he has more paint

05:05.070 --> 05:06.153
than a French kindergarten.

05:06.221 --> 05:08.122
Are you proposing we join him?

05:08.190 --> 05:09.723
I'm proposing
his ammo joins us.

05:09.774 --> 05:11.425
You haven't changed.

05:11.493 --> 05:12.576
You think Pierce has?

05:12.661 --> 05:13.744
Annie, let's not rehash this.

05:13.828 --> 05:14.895
The guy's been a jerk all year.

05:14.963 --> 05:16.497
He's a jerk
because we exclude him.

05:16.565 --> 05:18.632
We exclude him
because he's a jerk.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.634
And the last time I checked,
you were the last one

05:20.702 --> 05:23.254
feeling sorry about it.

05:34.983 --> 05:37.518
I guess I'm still waiting
for you guys to come around.

05:37.586 --> 05:39.270
Likewise.

05:40.889 --> 05:42.806
Okay, I'm--
I am dead now.

05:42.891 --> 05:44.091
I'm dead.

05:46.561 --> 05:48.529
Who wears spurs in paintball?

06:03.378 --> 06:05.346
Who the hell are you?

06:05.413 --> 06:08.215
The guy that's gonna win.

06:16.591 --> 06:18.892
Come on!

06:25.133 --> 06:27.134
Does that guy
even go to this school?

06:27.185 --> 06:28.135
He's really good-looking.

06:28.186 --> 06:30.004
Like, network TV good-looking.

06:30.071 --> 06:31.505
And did you see how big
his guns were?

06:31.573 --> 06:32.840
Why don't you just
marry him, Abed?

06:32.907 --> 06:33.974
I'm just saying
paintball is tough this year.

06:34.042 --> 06:35.242
I agree.

06:37.746 --> 06:38.662
Careful, Britta.

06:38.747 --> 06:39.913
You can't hit all three of us.

06:39.981 --> 06:41.282
She won't have to.

06:46.538 --> 06:48.505
- Hey, Troy.
- Abed!

06:50.325 --> 06:51.825
- I thought you were dead.
- I thought you were dead.

06:51.876 --> 06:54.261
- Guys.
- Oh, right.

06:54.329 --> 06:56.513
By the power invested
in us as deputies,

06:56.598 --> 06:58.732
we now pronounce you arrested.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.768
Deputies? What are you,
Deputies of the Stairwell?

07:00.835 --> 07:02.603
Fort Hawthorne.

07:02.671 --> 07:05.105
There's a bounty
on your head, my friend.

07:05.173 --> 07:07.474
Hm.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.511
Pierce.

07:10.578 --> 07:11.745
My forehead's
not that big, right?

07:11.813 --> 07:13.881
- Mm.
- It's not small.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.062
So you guys let Pierce boss you around

07:19.182 --> 07:20.424
in exchange for paint pellets?

07:20.425 --> 07:21.792
Actually, Jeff,
he's been pretty decent

07:21.859 --> 07:22.859
in this game so far.

07:22.927 --> 07:24.160
He's created a safe zone

07:24.212 --> 07:25.512
where people can rest, eat,
and if necessary,

07:25.596 --> 07:26.797
pump their breast milk.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.348
Wow, that sounds
very nice of him.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.083
Beats standing around
with empty guns,

07:30.151 --> 07:32.001
waiting to get picked off
by the Black Rider.

07:32.053 --> 07:34.104
Are you talking
about the handsome blond cowboy

07:34.172 --> 07:35.338
with the big guns?

07:35.406 --> 07:36.406
Is that guy a student?

07:36.474 --> 07:37.441
Who--who is he?

07:37.508 --> 07:38.742
We just call him
the Black Rider.

07:38.810 --> 07:40.577
Okay, but he's not really
riding anything.

07:40.645 --> 07:42.379
Look, I don't name people,
Annie.

07:42.447 --> 07:43.713
I'm a deputy.

07:43.781 --> 07:45.549
I deputize.

07:45.616 --> 07:47.584
You have to surrender
your guns.

07:47.652 --> 07:50.253
Oh, and your drugs.

08:08.339 --> 08:10.073
Ah.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.225
My study group.

08:12.310 --> 08:13.310
How long has it been?

08:13.377 --> 08:15.111
- Five hours.
- Too long.

08:15.179 --> 08:16.947
Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.

08:17.014 --> 08:19.249
How is this even possible?

08:19.317 --> 08:21.234
It began with a dream, Annie.

08:21.319 --> 08:24.020
A dream and an impulse to hide
in the men's room.

08:24.088 --> 08:26.072
I found that people
were willing to roll bullets

08:26.157 --> 08:27.557
under the door,

08:27.625 --> 08:29.059
just for the right
to take a dump.

08:29.126 --> 08:30.393
By the way, for you guys,

08:30.461 --> 08:32.796
taking a dump's on the house.

08:32.864 --> 08:36.249
Or if you prefer,
relax and catch a show.

08:39.203 --> 08:41.171
This is insane.

08:41.239 --> 08:42.405
Don't worry, Jeff.

08:42.472 --> 08:46.776
I've also got someone
more your speed.

08:46.844 --> 08:48.011
Because you're gay.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.346
All right,
I think I've seen enough,

08:49.413 --> 08:51.798
and I'd like my gun back now.

08:51.883 --> 08:53.416
Only Hawthorne personnel

08:53.484 --> 08:56.353
can carry weapons
inside, Jeffrey.

08:56.420 --> 08:57.821
All right,
you got us here unarmed,

08:57.889 --> 08:58.855
at your mercy.

08:58.923 --> 08:59.856
What do you want?

08:59.924 --> 09:00.941
We'll discuss over dinner.

09:01.025 --> 09:01.992
You're famished.

09:02.059 --> 09:04.811
Tonight, we feast.

09:07.598 --> 09:11.968
Ah, the twinkies
are wonderful tonight.

09:12.036 --> 09:14.604
Give us some space, Miguel.

09:17.074 --> 09:19.609
What if I told you guys
I know where to find

09:19.660 --> 09:22.712
enough ammo to end
this cowardly hiding out

09:22.780 --> 09:25.215
and split the prize seven ways?

09:25.282 --> 09:26.299
So send your goons to get it.

09:26.384 --> 09:27.551
Ah, they'd never bring it back.

09:27.618 --> 09:29.452
We trust each other.
We're a study group.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.287
That's pretty warm
and fuzzy talk

09:31.339 --> 09:32.756
coming from you, Pierce.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.140
Mm-hmm, you've kind of acted
like a villain this year.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.842
- I have?
- Well--

09:35.927 --> 09:36.977
- A little bit.
- You guys.

09:37.061 --> 09:40.797
Pierce is reaching out.

09:40.865 --> 09:42.799
I'm not risking my butt
hauling ammo back

09:42.850 --> 09:44.985
for the guy that has Vicky
dancing for twinkies.

09:45.069 --> 09:47.137
She's a dance major, Jeff.

09:47.204 --> 09:48.488
And she loves twinkies.

09:48.573 --> 09:50.273
And if you ever took the time
to get to know her--

09:50.324 --> 09:51.374
Look.

09:51.442 --> 09:55.645
Uh, summer starts tomorrow.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.415
For you guys,
it means pool parties,

09:58.482 --> 10:01.885
dinners,
one-night stands.

10:01.953 --> 10:04.321
For me...

10:04.388 --> 10:08.425
It means counting down the days
'til next fall.

10:08.492 --> 10:11.795
Before we go,
let me do this for you.

10:11.862 --> 10:15.048
Let me bring us victory.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.352
Fine.

10:36.404 --> 10:38.555
Let's do it.

10:38.623 --> 10:39.556
To the study group.

10:39.624 --> 10:42.525
To the study group.

10:42.593 --> 10:43.760
Ah.

10:43.828 --> 10:45.361
More juice, Miguel.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.833
I hope we find this cache
of ammunition soon.

10:49.900 --> 10:50.867
I need to pump.

10:50.935 --> 10:52.902
Me, too.

10:52.970 --> 10:54.237
You talkin' about peeing,
right?

10:54.305 --> 10:56.039
- No.
- Me, neither.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.540
Okay, about Pierce.

10:57.608 --> 10:59.059
I feel bad.

10:59.143 --> 11:00.710
I shouldn't put
so much effort into--

11:00.778 --> 11:02.312
It's okay.
I just think--

11:02.380 --> 11:03.913
The study group
is my family, you know?

11:03.981 --> 11:05.315
And if we start
picking and choosing--

11:05.383 --> 11:06.983
Where do we stop?

11:07.051 --> 11:08.718
I get it.

11:08.786 --> 11:10.120
You're a good kid.

11:10.187 --> 11:12.922
And I wanna do my part
to help you stay that way.

11:17.061 --> 11:18.361
Benjamin Chang,

11:18.429 --> 11:20.430
for your betrayal
of the Cheerleaders' Alliance,

11:20.498 --> 11:22.615
I sentence you
to pretendsies death.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.117
Guys?

11:24.201 --> 11:25.835
You don't have to do this.

11:25.903 --> 11:27.270
I betrayed the math club
for you.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.404
- Ready...
- Heather!

11:28.456 --> 11:30.140
I'm sorry I told Trish
about Amber!

11:30.207 --> 11:32.459
- Aim...
- Fire.

11:36.213 --> 11:38.448
- Holy crap.
- Not cool, bitch.

11:38.516 --> 11:40.850
Yeah, so you told me
at last year's tryouts.

11:40.918 --> 11:43.153
Leave the guns.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.355
Whatev.

11:45.422 --> 11:46.690
Who's there?

11:46.757 --> 11:47.691
Can I join you?

11:47.758 --> 11:51.260
- No!
- Okay.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.530
Damn it, I'm out.
Gimme your gun.

11:53.597 --> 11:55.448
All right, be careful.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.484
Cheerleaders rule!

12:07.878 --> 12:10.814
I'll take that.

12:10.881 --> 12:13.133
Who are you?

12:13.217 --> 12:15.284
I'm the bad guy.

12:15.336 --> 12:18.788
Stop trying to fluster me
with your handsomeness.

12:18.856 --> 12:20.023
You're creepy.

12:20.091 --> 12:22.308
Then why is your chest
getting all flushed?

12:22.393 --> 12:24.460
It's a rash.

12:24.512 --> 12:26.663
I'm allergic to beans.

12:26.731 --> 12:28.865
Look, do you even go
to school here?

12:28.933 --> 12:31.067
Sorry, I get paid
to shoot paintballs, honey.

12:31.135 --> 12:32.068
Not the breeze.

12:32.136 --> 12:33.686
Lame.

12:33.771 --> 12:35.488
I'll hit you in the foot.

12:35.573 --> 12:38.208
Thank you.

12:43.547 --> 12:46.499
You're dry, sugar.

12:48.485 --> 12:50.537
Hey.

12:50.621 --> 12:52.322
Hey.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.045
I'll save you for last.

12:59.130 --> 13:01.014
You won't get the chance.

13:17.481 --> 13:19.365
You okay?

13:19.450 --> 13:20.533
I got a better look at him.

13:20.618 --> 13:21.684
He's not that good-looking.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.519
- Didn't he shoot you?
- He tried.

13:23.571 --> 13:24.571
He's a bad shot, too?

13:24.655 --> 13:25.822
Man, what does this guy

13:25.890 --> 13:26.956
have going for him?

13:29.660 --> 13:33.196
Pierce loaded your gun
with blanks.

13:41.939 --> 13:43.473
Don't--don't--don't shoot!

13:43.541 --> 13:47.043
Why does this keep happening?

13:48.395 --> 13:51.264
And what kind of ice cream
company does this?

13:51.348 --> 13:52.715
Where's the paintball stuff
from last year?

13:52.783 --> 13:53.917
I hid it

13:53.984 --> 13:55.435
so the school doesn't get
destroyed again.

13:55.519 --> 13:57.654
Too late.

13:57.721 --> 13:58.788
Oh, hi, Jeff.

13:58.856 --> 14:00.557
We just ran
into the Black Rider.

14:00.624 --> 14:02.992
Dean, if you want this game
to end,

14:03.060 --> 14:05.495
we need firepower.

14:06.564 --> 14:10.300
In there.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.502
The key's in my shorts.

14:18.209 --> 14:21.127
I can get it out, I guess.

14:24.915 --> 14:28.484
Now, this is more like it.

14:28.552 --> 14:29.652
Okay, Black Rider.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.423
Now let's see who's attractive.

14:33.490 --> 14:36.526
Dude, you have a problem.

14:36.593 --> 14:37.527
Whoa.

14:37.595 --> 14:41.698
Oh, nice.

14:41.765 --> 14:43.700
Whoa, where you going?

14:43.767 --> 14:46.119
To have a conversation
with Pierce.

14:46.203 --> 14:48.277
She's pretty awesome today.

14:59.340 --> 15:00.290
What happened?

15:00.374 --> 15:01.437
Black Rider.

15:01.912 --> 15:02.946
He wiped out the whole fort.

15:03.562 --> 15:05.463
Then why are you still here?

15:05.531 --> 15:06.993
I can't go back out there.

15:06.994 --> 15:08.794
This is the only life I know.

15:08.846 --> 15:11.698
Annie?

15:11.765 --> 15:14.584
Is that you?

15:14.652 --> 15:16.302
D'you get the ammo?

15:16.370 --> 15:18.471
Yep.

15:18.522 --> 15:21.074
Annie!
What are you doing?

15:21.141 --> 15:22.975
Why was Jeff's gun loaded
with blanks?

15:23.027 --> 15:24.494
Was it?

15:24.578 --> 15:26.996
Agh! Okay, okay, okay!

15:30.918 --> 15:31.884
Oh, coming out.

15:31.952 --> 15:36.889
Hey, hey.

15:36.957 --> 15:39.092
Oh, okay.

15:39.159 --> 15:40.259
I get it.

15:40.327 --> 15:41.661
So once again, I'm the bad guy.

15:41.712 --> 15:42.929
Yes.

15:42.996 --> 15:45.498
Well, he got to win last year.

15:45.566 --> 15:47.667
It's a game, Annie.
It's j--

15:47.735 --> 15:48.935
Fine.

15:49.002 --> 15:51.437
It's a game.

15:51.505 --> 15:53.439
Let's play.

15:56.644 --> 15:57.777
Put it in your holster.

15:57.845 --> 15:59.045
Come on, Annie.

15:59.113 --> 16:00.563
You're my favorite.
I don't wanna beat you.

16:00.648 --> 16:02.782
It's just that I don't want
Jeff to be--

16:02.850 --> 16:04.250
Put the gun in your holster,

16:04.318 --> 16:05.618
and let's play the game.

16:05.686 --> 16:07.820
Right.

16:07.888 --> 16:12.024
So you can shoot me
and play without me.

16:12.076 --> 16:13.960
That's this group's
favorite thing.

16:14.027 --> 16:15.528
We're always nice
to you, Pierce.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.963
Wrong.

16:17.030 --> 16:19.165
Wrong!

16:19.233 --> 16:20.800
Three days ago,
I walked in on you guys

16:20.867 --> 16:22.585
playing cards without me.

16:22.670 --> 16:23.636
Three days ago!

16:23.704 --> 16:25.972
We weren't playing cards.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.807
We were voting,
and you weren't invited

16:27.875 --> 16:29.242
because we were voting
about you.

16:29.309 --> 16:30.877
What?

16:30.944 --> 16:33.513
We were taking a vote...

16:33.580 --> 16:36.399
On whether we'd invite you
back to the group next year.

16:40.688 --> 16:43.573
Lucky for you,
it had to be unanimous.

16:43.657 --> 16:45.725
There was one holdout.

16:45.793 --> 16:48.161
One red card.

17:05.345 --> 17:07.012
Pick it up.

17:44.752 --> 17:46.586
Black Rider...

17:46.653 --> 17:49.222
It's Jeff Winger.

17:49.289 --> 17:51.691
I know you've heard
of me by now.

17:51.759 --> 17:53.993
No.

17:54.061 --> 17:55.478
He's lying.

17:55.562 --> 17:58.514
Look, if you're half
the cool cowboy

17:58.599 --> 17:59.699
you pretend to be,

17:59.767 --> 18:00.733
you'll respect that we've got

18:00.801 --> 18:02.702
a situation playing out here

18:02.770 --> 18:04.303
and let us be
until it's settled.

18:04.371 --> 18:05.972
Sure thing.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.162
And once it's settled...

18:13.247 --> 18:15.248
I'm taking out everybody
in this room.

18:15.315 --> 18:16.349
Oh.

18:16.416 --> 18:19.552
Starting with you,
Mr. Insecure.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.622
You think you're good-looking,
but you're not.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.991
You're average.

18:25.058 --> 18:26.292
You're just
an average-looking guy

18:26.360 --> 18:27.760
with a big chin.

18:50.984 --> 18:52.552
- What's going on?
- He's faking it.

18:52.619 --> 18:53.736
No, something's wrong with him.

18:53.821 --> 18:54.737
No, no, it's fake.

18:54.822 --> 18:55.988
Last week he did it

18:56.056 --> 18:57.290
to get out of letting me have
a stick of gum.

18:57.357 --> 18:58.524
He's old, though.
Could be real.

18:58.592 --> 19:00.126
It's real.
It is.

19:01.361 --> 19:02.528
The gurgling's a nice touch.

19:02.596 --> 19:04.297
You guys are terrible people.

19:04.364 --> 19:06.232
- Ah, we warned you.
- Buddy, are you all right?

19:06.300 --> 19:07.466
You want me to call 911?

19:08.752 --> 19:10.603
Sucker!

19:10.671 --> 19:12.038
- Wait, seriously?
- Told you, dude.

19:12.105 --> 19:13.923
- I'm the best!
- You're the worst.

19:14.007 --> 19:15.808
I'm out of the group?

19:15.876 --> 19:17.643
You're out of mine!

19:17.711 --> 19:19.645
And I'm winning!

19:19.713 --> 19:20.813
We've created a monster.

19:20.881 --> 19:22.915
Let's not give ourselves
too much credit.

19:22.983 --> 19:24.150
I'm out.

19:24.217 --> 19:26.068
Some old guy pretended
to have a heart attack.

19:26.153 --> 19:27.320
Shot me in the gut.

19:27.387 --> 19:30.189
I don't care.
That's your problem.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.274
This school sucks.

19:31.358 --> 19:32.959
Well, then why do you go here?

19:33.026 --> 19:34.160
I wouldn't go to this toilet

19:34.228 --> 19:35.995
with my big sister's toe.

19:36.063 --> 19:38.397
I take a class online.

19:38.465 --> 19:39.799
I was paid to be here
and win the game

19:39.867 --> 19:41.167
so my boss could keep
his prize money.

19:41.235 --> 19:43.669
You work
for the ice cream company?

19:43.737 --> 19:45.705
Sweetie, this thing
is so much bigger

19:45.772 --> 19:48.207
than you can even imagine.

19:48.258 --> 19:49.408
I'm outta here.

19:49.459 --> 19:52.378
I got Coldplay tickets.

19:52.429 --> 19:53.746
Coldplay?

19:53.797 --> 19:55.281
Too late, bean allergy.

19:55.349 --> 19:57.633
You blew it.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.303
Hello?

20:00.387 --> 20:02.521
Anybody?

20:02.589 --> 20:05.191
Does anyone have an alliance
I can join?

20:05.259 --> 20:08.945
I'm really loyal.

20:09.029 --> 20:10.146
Agh!

20:15.736 --> 20:17.937
Am I out?

20:31.551 --> 20:33.669
No Greendale student
can be allowed

20:33.754 --> 20:35.338
to win this game.

20:35.422 --> 20:39.592
Initiate plan B:
Operation Total Invasion.

20:39.792 --> 20:48.992
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

20:49.443 --> 20:51.478
Greendale students,

20:51.546 --> 20:53.363
I understand you've unified,

20:53.447 --> 20:56.082
and intend
to draw this game out.

20:56.150 --> 21:00.320
Well, if it's a war you want,
it's a war you shall lose.

21:00.388 --> 21:04.324
Resistance is as pointless
as your degrees.

21:06.761 --> 21:08.695
- Are we the little rascals?
- I was.

21:08.763 --> 21:11.164
I'm on your team!
Stop shooting me!

21:11.232 --> 21:12.832
We're gonna lose this war,
and this school!

21:12.900 --> 21:14.434
- Looks like this is it.
- We're dying out here!

21:14.502 --> 21:15.635
I had a dream
it would end this way.

21:15.703 --> 21:16.803
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.

21:16.871 --> 21:17.921
Then I guess
I'll see you in hell.

21:17.989 --> 21:20.138
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.
