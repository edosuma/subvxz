Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck-all

00:03.719 --> 00:07.279
about knowing fuck-all about owt
needs to watch their back.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.279
So you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.360 --> 00:14.599
sending prices sky-high, literally,

00:14.600 --> 00:17.679
literally taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:17.680 --> 00:19.839
Now you've got your ConDemNation ...

00:19.840 --> 00:23.599
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.600 --> 00:27.079
Have we had a national fucking
stroke, or what?

00:27.080 --> 00:30.559
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:30.560 --> 00:33.479
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.480 --> 00:36.919
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.079
Well, for fuck's sake,

00:39.080 --> 00:42.999
we live in Manchester,
and they charge us for water!

00:43.000 --> 00:47.764
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.519
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times...

00:51.520 --> 00:54.119
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak!

00:54.120 --> 00:59.649
It's not theirs any more.
This is our England now.

01:00.719 --> 01:02.698

Helping the blind to see,

There's more money in dentistry,

but I didn't get the grades,
so here I am,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.759
living the dream.

Beg pardon?

02:10.039 --> 02:11.079
Your prescription.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.519
No, you don't understand,
doctor.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.319
The dole sent me down here.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.739
You have to go through the motions,
or they dock your benefit.

02:17.794 --> 02:19.880
I'm not a doctor,
and you need glasses.

02:21.981 --> 02:26.145
That's... not... possible.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.554
It's fact.

02:27.593 --> 02:32.898
I'm not of the four-eyed persuasion.
I'm strong. Me against...

02:33.000 --> 02:35.079
I've got the constitution of an ox.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.359
An ox that needs glasses.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.199
There's fuck-all wrong with my eyes,
so get serious.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.223
Put your breasts away and look again
with your little torch,

02:43.266 --> 02:46.145

right this time.

Very fucking funny.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.479
How can a piss-stained tramp like
you be too vain to wear glasses?

03:41.480 --> 03:42.679
It's not vanity.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.799
Yeah, and a wash wouldn't go amiss!

03:43.800 --> 03:45.745
Fuck off, you chimp!

03:49.040 --> 03:51.439
All right, knock it on the head.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.359
Come on, we're only having a joke.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.599
Fuck off!

03:54.600 --> 03:57.780
Have we hurt your feelings?

04:01.760 --> 04:03.999
How was the graduation?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.561
Brilliant ceremony.
All dresses and gowns

04:07.584 --> 04:09.785
and hats like the Royal Wedding,

04:09.935 --> 04:11.901
but without the inbreeding.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.159
Magical, pregnancy. It's brilliant.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.839
It's a hoot.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.041
Do you mind if I have a little rub?

04:24.076 --> 04:26.385
Fire in, everyone else does.

04:31.365 --> 04:35.924
Good to have a graduate in the family.
White collar worker, respectable.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.679
Is that what it's about,
respectability?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.839
You're asking the wrong person.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.713
You dirty bastard!

04:47.240 --> 04:49.772
I hope he appreciates
all this effort.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.796
Buzzin'. Best day of my life.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.039
Got to go.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.879
Come on, stay for another drink.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.679
Yeah, don't go!

05:00.680 --> 05:02.199
His mates are throwing a party
for him.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.359
Yeah, my mates.

05:21.499 --> 05:23.959
I graduated.
I'm a qualified teacher.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.897
Mammoth.

05:25.976 --> 05:30.599
Mates? Fuck it,
they can wait an hour.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.879
Cheers, everyone!

05:34.880 --> 05:37.093
Here's to the class of 2012.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.279
You all right, love?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.519
Yeah. Must have got caught up
with his classmates.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.879
Did you tell him
you were planning a do?

05:53.880 --> 05:57.879
Thought he'd pick up on my hints.
Clearly not.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.559
His phone goes straight
to voicemail.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.599
Poor cow's in denial.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.799
What of?

06:04.800 --> 06:09.703
That her man's an arsehole.
Thank fuck we're normal, son, eh?

06:11.280 --> 06:12.319
For fuck's sake,

06:12.359 --> 06:15.630
look in the mirror before you
come out the toilet, will you?

06:24.440 --> 06:26.079
Sorry.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.429
Sorry.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.562
How about some porky pig?

06:43.531 --> 06:46.619
Vanity, thy name is salmonella.

06:46.675 --> 06:51.742
Jesus Christ! What the fuck,
Nosferatu?

06:51.773 --> 06:53.759
If you're trawling the night
for the blood of virgins,

06:53.760 --> 06:55.519
you'll have a long wait round here.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.439
I have the sweats, and you're lucky
I do. If you could read,

06:58.440 --> 07:00.673
you'd see that meat's not
fit for human consumption.

07:00.674 --> 07:02.906
I was saving it for theducks.

07:03.171 --> 07:04.799
Ducks can't eat bacon.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.319
Tell me something I don't know.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.559
And aren't you a bit
past your own sell-by

07:09.560 --> 07:12.279
to be self-conscious
about wearing glasses?

07:12.280 --> 07:14.559
I am not self-conscious.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.559
Bollocks. You're like a teenager
who's been told not to pop his zits.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.879
We do have mirrors.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.879
I am aware that energy expended on
vanity's largely wasted on my part,

07:24.880 --> 07:27.159
kind though it is of you
to point it out.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.556
So, what?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.559
I cannot be weak.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.479
I know what they think round here.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.399
You've seen how they treat me.
Laugh, point, kick, rob.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.079
Not many tears shed when
I fell in the Jockey, was there?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.799
Sticks and stones.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.799
It's only because I have this, yeah?
This.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.759
Faculties. Senses, head, body.

07:58.626 --> 08:01.199
If I'm strong,
they can do whatever they like,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.879
but they cannot penetrate.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.719
I am immune.

08:04.720 --> 08:09.767
And wearing glasses
fractures your superhero defences?

08:09.880 --> 08:15.017
Spectacles, hearing aids, walking
sticks, prosthetic limbs. These...

08:15.759 --> 08:17.103
these...

08:18.786 --> 08:22.025
place me on a very slippery slope.

08:23.149 --> 08:25.039
If I am weak...

08:25.040 --> 08:26.704
I will not survive.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.318
Yeah, we open at seven. Doesn't mean
I want to be out of my pit at seven.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.719
What time do you have, Feeney?

08:54.720 --> 08:56.159
Just gone half past the hour, Miss.

08:56.550 --> 08:58.632
Begin.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.159
Right, lads, not much time. You know
the drill. You, number 10. You, 11.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.439
Remember, be firm.
Get straight to the point.

09:20.440 --> 09:24.279
Leave them in no doubt.
They'll be glad of it.

09:24.280 --> 09:27.559
God in heaven, you'll have
the thing off its hinges!

09:27.560 --> 09:30.719
Don't open the door at this time
of the morning, it can only be...

09:30.720 --> 09:33.319
Operation New Start.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.079
DSS Gestapo.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.559
These are court-signed documents
ordering you

09:38.560 --> 09:41.119
to vacate these premises
with immediate effect.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.119
You're being evicted.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.399
All right, all right!
Keep your hair on...

09:50.400 --> 09:54.399
so I can scalp you
when I open the fucking door.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.759
Can we come in?

09:55.760 --> 09:56.959
No. It's not even nine yet.
What's going on?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.239
We've been evicted.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.159
Who has?

09:59.160 --> 10:03.159
All of us.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.039
Now, they can't search the house.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.039
We've still got
some human rights left

10:15.040 --> 10:17.479
in this fucking dictatorship
of the moderate.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.679
So we don't need to
flush the drugs, then?

10:19.680 --> 10:22.679
No, we're safe... what drugs?

10:22.680 --> 10:24.639
You stupid...

10:24.640 --> 10:28.159
If the place wasn't swarming with
suits, I'd strip-search you,

10:28.160 --> 10:29.279
you little bastard.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.599
What are you doing?

10:30.600 --> 10:34.599
Make noise, move about.
Be several children.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.239
Keep the noise down, will you?

10:38.240 --> 10:40.519
We've got guests. Bloody 'ell, kids.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.639
Mayhem up there.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.119
Hello.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.119
He still doesn't get it, Miss.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.839
Stop calling me "Miss".

10:51.840 --> 10:54.719
It's creepy, like I invented you
in a fucking lab.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.399
Sorry, Mi...

10:56.400 --> 10:58.919
So... Aidan Croker,

10:58.920 --> 11:02.359
14, should be upstairs.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.559
And this little angel
should be Stella.

11:04.560 --> 11:08.239
Are you enjoying your...
your breakfast?

11:08.240 --> 11:11.799
Prawn Cocktail. Loves her seafood,
so she does.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.039
Right, so no other children,
is that correct?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.879
Or are you suggesting
there are some more up there?

11:20.160 --> 11:23.439
Yeah, just the one.
But he puts himself about a bit.

11:23.440 --> 11:27.439
This is a multi-agency operation,
Mr Gallagher.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.639
Department of Work and Pensions,
local council,

11:31.640 --> 11:35.639
HMRC, environmental health,
the police.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.119
That's not fair!

11:39.120 --> 11:42.399
In the past, people have relied
on the left hand not knowing

11:42.400 --> 11:44.799
what the right hand is doing.
Not any more.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.919
You can't put people out
on the street. A child, a cripple.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.399
A geriatric fucking cripple.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.679
No, it's a broad remit.
Premises inspection,

11:52.680 --> 11:56.599
checking that claimants are getting
all they're entitled to...

11:56.600 --> 11:58.279
Or not.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.119
And in some very extreme cases,
I am sorry to say,

12:01.120 --> 12:04.759
the serving of eviction papers
to those individuals who have

12:04.760 --> 12:07.479
repeatedly ignored
the wishes of the court.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.799
What court?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.399
"Gallagher, Vernon Francis,

12:11.400 --> 12:13.719
"has failed to answer
a variety of charges

12:13.720 --> 12:17.439
"relating to benefit and council tax
fraud, amongst other things."

12:17.440 --> 12:21.439
Well, nobody told me.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.799
We have to look at this
as an opportunity.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.639
It frees you from that cycle
of debt and dependency,

12:35.640 --> 12:39.639
free to pursue a new start.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.399
Temporary accommodation for you and
the boy. Make sure and call ahead.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.799
St Helens?!

12:55.800 --> 12:58.799
Do you get that sense of freedom...

12:58.800 --> 13:07.999
being evicted so you can go forth
and fulfil your potential?

13:09.280 --> 13:13.279
See it as an opportunity to give up
the fags for good. Change your life!

13:13.320 --> 13:16.999
Fuck off, you bastard.
Look what you've done to me

13:17.000 --> 13:19.039
I'll never fit any of my clothes
again.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.319
In the delivery room, I want you
there,

13:21.320 --> 13:24.679
with an extra-strength filter tipped
and a Zippo, ready to go.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.599
I don't care whether they've
snipped the umbilical or not!

13:28.600 --> 13:29.799
Grub up.

13:29.800 --> 13:33.799
All nice and healthy for the baby.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.599
Cosy!

13:43.600 --> 13:45.439
How's the flat hunt going, Micky?

13:45.440 --> 13:48.559
I've not started yet, y'know,
been a bit busy.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.799
Life just takes over, doesn't?

13:50.800 --> 13:53.159
You know what they say,
two's company.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.119
Four's a party.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.799
I can't believe I'm going to be
called "Uncle Micky" again.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.439
Not... by blood.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.439
No, but we're roomies, so she can
call me that if she wants.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.239
I just called her "She"!

14:08.240 --> 14:09.599
Just gonna have a dump,

14:09.600 --> 14:13.279
kick me
mates out the spare room.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.919
We have got to get him
out of this fucking house.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.639
He won't take the hint.

14:19.640 --> 14:23.639
Maybe we could move.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.199
I better get going.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.759
What you flogging today?

14:34.760 --> 14:37.919
DVDs, bit of weed, fags,

14:37.920 --> 14:41.919
homebrew, viagra, toastie makers...

14:43.040 --> 14:47.039
they can't get
enough of the fucking toastie makers.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.319
OMG, come and have a look at
this Kel it's absolutely enormous!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.639
What time is it?

15:01.640 --> 15:03.999
Something's up,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.759
people running about all
over the place.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.199
When did I get in?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.599
About four.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.599
I got caught up, I'm sorry.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.199
Tomorrow's chip paper.

15:14.200 --> 15:18.199
I'm off, you better think about how
you're going to make this up to me.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.439
You're totally up shit creek.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.479
Enough!

15:33.480 --> 15:37.479
You're like a herd
of geese, squawk, squawk, squawk!

15:38.400 --> 15:40.799
Gaggle.

15:40.800 --> 15:41.839
What?

15:41.840 --> 15:45.839
S'not a "herd of geese",
it's a "gaggle of geese".

15:48.240 --> 15:51.719
You wouldn't say "a flock of dogs",
would you?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.759
Half six this morning
bailiffs turned up.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.879
DWP, who's that,
what's it stand for?

15:59.840 --> 16:03.079
Any idea what they're going
on about?

16:03.080 --> 16:05.319
Don't know, don't care.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.799
Can't hang around here,
tell you that for no charge.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.799
Where else are they supposed to go?

16:13.480 --> 16:17.479
Fine, I'll go
and see what's going on.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.999
I presume there's a story here.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.119
Good night, was it?

16:39.120 --> 16:41.039
Yeah.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.039
Your missus put on a decent spread,
it's a pity you missed it.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.559
She's a good woman, don't fuck it
up, I speak from experience.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.079
I'll make it up to her.
What's going on?

16:52.080 --> 16:53.959
Arresting folk for false
claims.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.399
Half the estate'll be in jail.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.719
I think that's the plan.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.079
Well, you know,
if you can't do the time, eh?

17:01.720 --> 17:05.719
Dick.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.919
What's the story, Ches?

17:10.920 --> 17:14.919
Don't know, stormtroopers,
occupied territory.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.919
Step back, please.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.839
I'm a local business owner...
got a couple of questions.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.839
Let her through.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.319
Can I ask what's going on?

17:35.320 --> 17:36.239
You are...?

17:36.240 --> 17:39.999
Karen Maguire I run a pub
just up the road.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.919
You are?

17:40.920 --> 17:43.839
I'm so sorry, Carmen Kenaway,
Care Kenaway Solutions.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.519
I'm on secondment with
Operation New Start.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.479
You're evicting people?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.639
We provide support to those
who most need it.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.919
So... you're not evicting people?

17:52.920 --> 17:56.839
Those defrauding government agencies
have all assistance suspended.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.039
Including housing?

18:00.040 --> 18:00.639
Karen leave it.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.719
What?

18:01.720 --> 18:05.319
We've got licenses to protect.

18:05.320 --> 18:09.319
Don't open the door, Benny.
Don't open the door!

18:09.480 --> 18:13.479
If you don't let them in,
they can't force entry...

18:17.640 --> 18:21.479
Two streets so far, seven families.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.119
It's got fuck all to do with us,

18:23.120 --> 18:25.319
the last thing
we need is to draw attention.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.599
They can't just evict people.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.839
Pint, please.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.839
Splitting families up, temporary
accommodation,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.439
hostels, shelters all over the North
West.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.999
Wigan, St. Helens, Liverpool...

18:35.000 --> 18:37.039
That's worse than being homeless.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.719
Any chance of some fucking service,
down here?

18:39.720 --> 18:42.319
These families are in proper
trouble.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.159
Everybody's got a sob story,

18:44.160 --> 18:46.639
so forgive me if I can't get worked
up about it.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.199
I've got problems of my own,

18:48.200 --> 18:49.559
like where I'm going to house my
dependents.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.319
Don't be stupid, we've put
Patty in our spare room.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.319
I've got Aidan at ours.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.319
And we've got Stella.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.319
Well, don't all rush at once.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.079
Maybe if you weren't such a...

19:04.080 --> 19:05.719
I scrub up!

19:05.720 --> 19:07.839
A cunt, I think
she was going to say.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.319
You can't wash that off.

19:09.320 --> 19:13.319
Well, fuck the lot of you.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.319
Hello, officer.

19:20.320 --> 19:23.519
I heard you were coming back.
Well, good luck.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.799
They're not gonna make it easy.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.799
So, what's happened?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.759
No one told you?
You've been evicted Carl.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.369
Patty's bunking at ours,

19:34.908 --> 19:37.239
Aidan and Stella are staying
at the Maguire's, so everyone's safe.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.079
And dad?

19:39.080 --> 19:41.719
I'm sure we can make space for you.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.159
I'm OK, thanks.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.439
I'll sort something.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.439
We'll have few drinks later,
celebrate you being back?

20:09.720 --> 20:13.719
The prodigal Pig returns.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.319
You let us get evicted?

20:15.320 --> 20:18.559
Move along you're not fit company.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.039
So, this is the plan?

20:20.040 --> 20:24.039
Live rough,
sup the breakfast of champions?

20:26.080 --> 20:27.799
How could you do this to me?

20:27.800 --> 20:28.839
To you?!

20:28.840 --> 20:32.839
Yes, to me, remember,
the one who brought you up.

20:33.720 --> 20:37.599
Fucking shame of it what have
I done to deserve this?

20:37.600 --> 20:38.799
It's a good job.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.919
You're a police officer.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.399
Fucking hell!

20:42.400 --> 20:45.799
Yeah, fucking hell, yeah!
One of them.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.079
Yeah, I am.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.926
Job, pension, purpose.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.119
You're no son of mine.

20:57.240 --> 21:01.239
I'm devastated.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.279
Has he joined the coppers?

21:07.280 --> 21:11.279
I don't know.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.999
Hello, hello, hello.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.039
Y'all right?
Thought I might get a bite to eat.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.359
Where've you been haven't
seen you in ages?

21:25.360 --> 21:27.719
Doing my training.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.159
You know that I've joined the...?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.319
You bastard.

21:31.320 --> 21:32.959
Welcome back, mate.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.759
Besides not like they brainwashed
you is it?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.399
You're still one of us.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.039
Yeah, course.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.319
Look at you, all grown up!

21:41.320 --> 21:45.039
Where's the handcuffs
and the truncheon?

21:45.040 --> 21:48.399
Don't graduate till next week,
get all the gear then.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.279
I'm hoping
they'll let me bring a taser home.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.719
Where are you crashing?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.239
Don't know yet... just saw my Dad...

21:57.240 --> 22:00.409
Stay with us
the more the merrier at the minute.

22:00.432 --> 22:01.431
You sure?

22:01.456 --> 22:02.495
Yeah, course.

22:02.496 --> 22:04.335
C'mon, grab a box while you're at it.

22:04.484 --> 22:07.245
Don't worry about that, mate,
on you go.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.119
Jesus Christ!

22:30.120 --> 22:32.839
How long FERRET have you been
stood there for?

22:32.840 --> 22:35.839
Long enough to know you're
a fucking weirdo.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.119
Pot, kettle CUNT black.

22:38.120 --> 22:41.039
I don't like you being here
you should go.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.479
I've got a message.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.359
Like Jesus?

22:43.360 --> 22:44.159
What?

22:44.160 --> 22:45.759
Derren Brown? Magdalene?

22:45.760 --> 22:49.759
No, fuckwit, for you.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.159
And my ex.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.199
Should I write it down?

22:57.200 --> 23:01.199
You've got a babby coming,
and I know how much she wants that.

23:02.440 --> 23:06.439
And, it's not the babby's fault
she's the spawn of a mental midget.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.551
You said 'she'.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.255
Yes I did, didn't I?

23:13.280 --> 23:17.239
For what it's worth,
I don't wish you harm.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.239
There'll be no trouble from me.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.759
You're losing the circulation
to your hand.

23:26.760 --> 23:30.759
Thank you. JAFFA!

23:38.320 --> 23:42.039
Choccy's too big!
You might have to open the door.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.719
Can you do that?

23:43.720 --> 23:47.719
Wait a minute
I might have found another one.

23:52.880 --> 23:56.199
There's more than one way to skin a
cat, Feeney,

23:56.200 --> 24:00.199
little bit of initiative.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.559
Hey, you're doing a good job.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.759
Time someone took this
place to task.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.227
And, er, what's your name?

24:10.266 --> 24:12.040
Jackson Powell.
Jackson Powell...

24:14.660 --> 24:17.574
What is it, Miss, what is it?

24:17.644 --> 24:19.919
You dirty bastard!

24:19.920 --> 24:21.319
Get up, get up!

24:21.320 --> 24:23.879
Isn't that the person
we saw this morning?

24:23.880 --> 24:26.719
I think it is, Miss, yes. Get Up!

24:26.720 --> 24:28.559
Feeney, Feeney, wait.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.628
This is an opportunity.

24:38.120 --> 24:41.479
I mean, look at 'im.
How long's old Malky lived 'ere?

24:41.480 --> 24:42.639
Don't remember a time when he didn't.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.122
And have you ever seen him
put his hand in his pocket?

24:46.960 --> 24:49.679
Not once, the tight-fisted fucker!

24:49.680 --> 24:52.359
He's been nursing that
for four hours. RIGHT!

24:52.360 --> 24:55.439
Time to get a shift on! Hooverville
won't build itself, y'know?

24:55.440 --> 24:56.159
What you doing?

24:56.160 --> 24:58.239
They're getting a bit cosy.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.959
I told them they could crash 'ere!

24:59.960 --> 25:02.119
Well, that can't be legal.
So un-tell them.

25:02.120 --> 25:06.039
Tweet me, and complain.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.399
Like me Uncle Terry, that.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.759
This one time, he beat the
living shit out of my Aunty Sheila.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.759
Did she deserve it?

25:11.760 --> 25:12.799
What?

25:12.800 --> 25:15.239
Did she deserve the beating?

25:15.240 --> 25:19.159
I don't know, I was only little.
Anyway that's not the story...

25:19.160 --> 25:21.519
She didn't deserve it,
because hitting a woman

25:21.520 --> 25:24.279
isneveracceptable, understand?

25:24.280 --> 25:27.999
This is an important lesson for you,
since you've married our Mam.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.639
I understand! I do!

25:30.640 --> 25:33.039
Give it a proper wash!

25:33.040 --> 25:34.479
Hey!

25:34.480 --> 25:37.039
Got a few kegs I need to shift
up from the cellar.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.519
Give us a hand?
Earn your keep while you're 'ere.

25:39.520 --> 25:43.519
Yeah, no probs.

25:44.440 --> 25:45.679
What was that for?

25:45.680 --> 25:47.599
You've made summat of yourself.

25:47.600 --> 25:51.599
And you don't let anybody
fuck it up for you.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.839
So...

26:01.840 --> 26:04.239
How are we gonna make
this work, then?

26:04.240 --> 26:05.679
How d'you mean?

26:05.680 --> 26:08.039
Monthly retainer.

26:08.040 --> 26:11.879
Little bit extra if we need
something more specific.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.879
Fuck off! I'm a probationer
for two years!

26:14.880 --> 26:18.119
I'll be mainly making cuppas and
having the piss taken out of me.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.959
Yeah, well, call it a long-term
investment, then.

26:20.960 --> 26:24.959
You'll be able to buy yourself
a nice little runaround before long.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.039
Look, I'll never land you in it, J.
You know that.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.399
But I'll always be me own man.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.629
We can't talk about this again.

26:37.080 --> 26:40.039
Besides, half of these are
doubled-up, you tight bastard!

26:40.040 --> 26:42.799
Yeah, couldn't get to the
fucking bank before it shut,

26:42.800 --> 26:44.279
could I?

26:44.280 --> 26:44.919
So what we shifting?

26:44.920 --> 26:48.919
These big bastards over 'ere.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.599
Hey, they don't skimp on expenses
for the corporate raiders, d'they?

26:57.800 --> 27:00.999
I won't lie to you.
So you feeling better?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.119
What? I regard you bringing me
here as a hostile action.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.559
You were destitute!
You ungrateful pig.

27:05.560 --> 27:08.199
Temporarily, I think you'll find!

27:08.200 --> 27:11.839
Daniella! Please excuse Mrs Feeney.
We're a very close team,

27:11.840 --> 27:13.879
and she's naturally protective.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.599
"Mrs?" Really?
Somebody need a passport?

27:17.600 --> 27:21.079
Would you leave us, please?

27:21.080 --> 27:25.079
So, Frank, I am curious.

27:26.800 --> 27:30.079
Were there no family that
could take you in? No friends?

27:30.080 --> 27:32.759
Social evolution in practice.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.319
What?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.839
I wear glasses.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.039
Right?

27:39.040 --> 27:41.359
These. Slippery slope.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.319
Galapagos Islands round our way.
If you're weak, you'll be savaged.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.839
If I am fucking, this, man!

27:48.840 --> 27:52.479
Cunts in this place will eat me
alive, without a second thought.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.599
Thanks to you lot!

27:53.600 --> 27:54.879
My lot?

27:54.880 --> 27:58.239
Come on, don't pretend
you're "Of the people."

27:58.240 --> 28:02.239
Your fucking shoes alone would buy
a three-bed semi in my street

28:03.160 --> 28:05.119
Come on! People are, y'know,

28:05.120 --> 28:09.119
they're tired of this "them and us"
mentality, aren't they?

28:09.840 --> 28:13.719
Always seems to be the Old Etonians

28:13.720 --> 28:17.039
telling the rest we live
in a classless society

28:17.040 --> 28:20.919
as they pass laws to deregulate
around their investments.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.839
The old divides don't apply.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.239
It's about survival, nowadays.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.999
Hey, your neighbours weren't slow
to cast you out, hmm?

28:29.000 --> 28:32.199
D'you think they're worried about
what's become of you now?

28:32.200 --> 28:33.919
I suspect not.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.439
We want the same thing.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.799
You scratch my back...

28:38.800 --> 28:42.319
God!

28:42.320 --> 28:46.119
Well, I wondered when
this was coming up.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.879
OK.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.879
No more free lunches, eh?

28:53.560 --> 28:57.239
I was thinking more...

28:57.240 --> 29:00.519
information, and less...

29:00.520 --> 29:04.519
penis.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.599
Derek Molinari.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.719
What a fucking chancer!

29:12.720 --> 29:16.359
Punches in for his shift
at Meinhoffer's.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.679
Ching!

29:17.680 --> 29:21.679
And then heads out to the bookies
all day,

29:22.840 --> 29:26.839
only stepping out to sign-on
every Thursday.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.479
Bet he's not the worst!

29:30.480 --> 29:34.479
Not by a long shot!

29:34.920 --> 29:38.919
I tell you who's a lying twat!
He never shares his smokes.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.759
Biscuit-arse Pettigrew.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.599
Ronnie, to his mother.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.599
Apart from 'aving BO that could
fell a fucking buffalo at 20 paces,

29:51.360 --> 29:55.359
he's claiming on four
different addresses.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.639
And does he share
the goodies around?

29:59.640 --> 30:03.639
Did Jesus have a rubber cross?

30:07.880 --> 30:10.479
Thought I was going to
run out of tape.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.639
Would you like me to have
your room cleared?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.559
That's not my room!
I wouldn't let that stench

30:15.560 --> 30:18.039
anywhere near the place
where I lay my head.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.759
No, I'm over here.

30:19.760 --> 30:23.759
OK, would you like a wake-up call,
Miss? I could bring you a coffee?

30:30.600 --> 30:33.119
(If you were mine,

30:33.120 --> 30:37.119
(I'd have a cast made
of your magnificent breasts,

30:37.920 --> 30:41.919
(and this tongue would probe

30:43.920 --> 30:47.279
(and plunge deep... )

30:47.280 --> 30:51.279
Front-bottom, not back...

30:51.600 --> 30:53.159
Did you say something?

30:53.160 --> 30:55.879
No, Miss, I was just
thinking, erm...

30:55.880 --> 30:56.959
Night, Feeney.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.959
Good night, Miss.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.999
What the fuck?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.919
H, I don't carry cash!

31:09.920 --> 31:13.679
Me arse isn't clean!

31:17.732 --> 31:18.771
Go on!

31:20.063 --> 31:22.719
Yes, Kelly?

31:22.720 --> 31:25.719
All you're
planning to do is sit back

31:25.720 --> 31:28.839
and carry on selling 100 quid's
worth of weed a week!

31:28.840 --> 31:32.719
Micky, d'you mind? Can't be
doing with telly first thing.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.399
It's brilliant, this one!
They get the DNA and they find out...

31:36.400 --> 31:38.719
There's no fucking milk!

31:38.720 --> 31:41.199
Marty's got something to ask you.

31:41.200 --> 31:41.679
Well, see, I...

31:41.680 --> 31:44.999
You need to move out.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.039
What?

31:46.040 --> 31:47.519
We're nesting.

31:47.520 --> 31:51.519
We need room for the baby, mate.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.879
But I was gonna help you, you know.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.959
Like the Three Musketeers.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.199
No, we're like the two musketeers,
and you're like a bloke

31:59.200 --> 32:03.199
who insists on crashing with us,
and won't take a fucking hint!

32:03.360 --> 32:05.239
You've been hinting?

32:05.240 --> 32:08.439
In neon, with megaphones! Had a
biplane fly past the other day,

32:08.440 --> 32:11.479
trailing a banner. "Micky,
have the sense you were born with

32:11.480 --> 32:12.719
"and get the fuck out."

32:12.720 --> 32:14.959
You're a brilliant flatmate...

32:14.960 --> 32:21.170
No, you're right.
Your needs are greater.

32:21.522 --> 32:22.959
Don't be like that!

32:22.960 --> 32:26.039
I'll be gone in an hour.

32:26.040 --> 32:30.039
Think you were direct enough?

32:32.920 --> 32:35.359
Why can't you crash
in the dormobile?

32:35.360 --> 32:39.319
I don't get the keys for that!
They know I'd sell the rust bucket!

32:39.320 --> 32:42.319
Don't wash your gonads in the sink!
Other people have to brush

32:42.320 --> 32:43.359
their teeth there!

32:43.360 --> 32:44.839
Where you gonna kip tonight?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.959
Wherever I lay my hat, son.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.479
I was born under a wandering star.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.159
I need no man. I am a rock.

32:53.160 --> 32:56.919
A rock? Frank, you're washing
yourself in me brother's gaffe,

32:56.920 --> 33:00.919
and rolling on deodorant
supplied by the bollock-washer!

33:01.000 --> 33:03.519
Trust me, it's every man
for himself.

33:03.520 --> 33:07.519
Only the strongest will survive.

33:07.840 --> 33:11.439
Don't... Don't do that.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.719
Keep your strength!
All for one, one for all.

33:17.720 --> 33:21.719
You don't fool me
for a fucking minute!

33:29.760 --> 33:32.919
All right, Shane,
what's the abuse today?

33:32.920 --> 33:36.919
Go on! Do your worst, I'm a big boy.

33:39.397 --> 33:40.647
You all right?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.293
I got you something.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.239
What am I looking at?

33:57.451 --> 34:01.450
All of 'em! Any one you like.
Might as well aim high.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.959
Time to move on.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.159
Finally!

34:05.160 --> 34:08.958
What if I don't want to?
I like it here.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.958
It's what we always said we'd do,
when I graduated.

34:15.120 --> 34:19.119
I think we were wrong to want that.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.759
I think we're right.

34:21.760 --> 34:25.319
Mate, you need to make
the most of it while you can.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.279
Random drugs tests and all that.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.679
Fuck off!

34:30.679 --> 34:34.478
Besides, I don't think I
can go through with it.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.518
What?

34:35.520 --> 34:37.639
Passing out ceremony.

34:37.639 --> 34:41.639
So you did all the training,
but you're not gonna graduate?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.279
What's the point in that?

34:43.280 --> 34:44.679
I can't, not...

34:44.679 --> 34:46.998
Not without me Dad's blessing.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.359
Fuck your Dad!

34:49.360 --> 34:51.119
If I go, who's gonna look after 'im?

34:51.120 --> 34:52.359
Look, he's a survivor.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.159
If there's no-one there to
protect him from himself,

34:55.159 --> 34:58.639
he'll be dead within 18 month.

34:58.640 --> 35:01.559
I can't do that to him.

35:01.560 --> 35:05.239
I can't let him cut me off.

35:13.160 --> 35:17.159
Miss, no-one's answering their doors!

35:22.160 --> 35:26.159
I haven't the patience for this.
Call a town meeting.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.199
Put our cards on the table.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.999
Are you sure?

35:30.000 --> 35:33.319
What we're doing is for the good
of these people.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.167
It's time they understood that.

35:37.682 --> 35:43.418
That's 75% of benefit claims
in this area are fraudulent...

35:43.440 --> 35:47.279
They're not fraudulent, they're
rejected. There's a difference.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.891
Parliamentary procedure!

35:49.953 --> 35:51.758
Miss Kenaway has the floor.

35:51.789 --> 35:54.074
If you want to make an
interjection, approach the

35:54.075 --> 35:56.359
microphone and the chair
will recognise you.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.519
You heard me.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.999
The thing is, you have got to
pay your way and, more importantly...

36:07.000 --> 36:08.959
Don't lose your head.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.079
This matters to me.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.159
Why?

36:11.160 --> 36:13.479
Because if I fuck them,
I fuck myself.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.119
I don't buy into all this
nobility bollocks.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.150
Yeah, you do. You can't fool me.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.199
I know you.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.439
But we can't go on like this.

36:24.440 --> 36:29.041
Less than 15% of residents pay
any council tax at all.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.759
No wonder!
Order!

36:30.760 --> 36:33.479
Why...

36:33.814 --> 36:37.813
Why should anyone pay
council tax round here?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.359
The state of the roads!

36:39.360 --> 36:41.799
Half the streetlights haven't
worked in a year.

36:44.440 --> 36:48.439
You're making my point for me.
The Chatsworth is a failed estate.

36:48.547 --> 36:51.439
It might be a shithole,
but it's our shithole!

36:51.440 --> 36:54.839
No-one wants to move here.
You can't expect the authorities

36:54.840 --> 36:57.119
to keep on throwing
good money after bad.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.999
Invest.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.352
Right, OK, I know for a fact
that someone in this room

37:06.408 --> 37:10.407
works at the Meinhoff brewery,
and is claiming disability benefit.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.239
Someone else, lives in... Anchor Way,

37:13.240 --> 37:17.159
is claiming on
four separate addresses.

37:17.160 --> 37:22.259
Swing a cat, and you'll hit
half a dozen. That'snotthe point.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.985
Order!

37:25.017 --> 37:27.727
Well, what is the point?

37:28.635 --> 37:30.462
I'm waiting.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.985
Stop punishing people who can't
defend themselves.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.839
We're not punishing anyone.

37:37.840 --> 37:38.879
Yeah, you are.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.719
This places sticks in your craw

37:40.720 --> 37:43.239
because we're a dent on
the balance sheet.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.559
And the fucking balance sheet
is your god, correct?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.999
This operation will continue
whether you co-operate or not.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.665
Fine.

37:54.821 --> 37:56.199
Bring it on.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.879
You're barred!

38:01.880 --> 38:03.399
Why do I get the feeling I've
just been set up?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.879
Because you have.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.439
Told you I knew you.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.653
You do realise we've just
declared war?

38:20.040 --> 38:21.599
Whatare you doing?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.119
How d'you mean?

38:23.120 --> 38:24.959
I told you that stuff in confidence.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.119
You're the one who doesn't
believe in society.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.679
Doesn't mean I want to
join in the goose-stepping!

38:30.680 --> 38:33.239
This isn't about class.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.199
We're not the SS.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.959
It's about people
getting away with it.

38:37.960 --> 38:41.319
They bought shares in utilities,
and satellite dishes

38:41.320 --> 38:43.639
when the going was good.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.199
They?

38:46.418 --> 38:49.535
Who arethey?

38:49.560 --> 38:52.879
They are the people who might be
a little bit funny

38:52.880 --> 38:55.280
if they knew that you and me
had been chatting.

38:57.113 --> 39:01.112
Keep your ears open, Frank.
I want to know whattheyare doing.

39:07.046 --> 39:09.839
Shit.

39:10.880 --> 39:11.719
20 cigs. Come on.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.999
No.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.679
Why the fuck not?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.171
Cos you're a tosser.

39:16.234 --> 39:17.984
Serve him, Ches.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.439
It's all right, forget it.
I think I've just lost me craving.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.839
You should be proud of Carl.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.999
Proud? Proud?! Of that traitor?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.639
Yeah!

39:27.640 --> 39:28.919
Not the traitor bit, though.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.119
What is your problem?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.639
What, the truth? Yeah.

39:32.640 --> 39:36.199
You are not like
your brothers and sisters.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.199
You are destined for
far lesser things.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.879
Cheeky bastard.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.399
You were my one great hope.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.959
The salvation of my loins.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.839
We fuck up.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.919
We turn the other cheek.
We run away.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.799
It's our DNA.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.679
Rotten to the core.
Like father like son.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.119
I'm nothing like you.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.159
I'm not.

40:03.200 --> 40:07.199
What are you doing?

40:07.480 --> 40:08.799
You're freaking me out, you tit.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.239
This job won't last.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.404
The real you's in there

40:12.427 --> 40:15.119
fighting to get out.

40:15.120 --> 40:19.119
And I am counting down the days...

40:25.320 --> 40:27.359
Know what gets me, though?

40:27.360 --> 40:31.199
Some fucker's grassing them up,
passing on details, and that.

40:31.200 --> 40:33.399
It's not right.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.079
I fucking hate grasses.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.719
Yeah, they know how to
treat them in Iraq and Iran,

40:37.720 --> 40:39.319
you know, in the Middle East.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.799
Cut their heads off, man...

40:40.800 --> 40:44.159
Wha-a-ah...

40:44.160 --> 40:46.759
No messing about.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.959
They decapitate you
for shopping someone?

40:48.960 --> 40:52.119
Yeah! Big, curly sword. Wha-tcha!

40:52.120 --> 40:53.599
They've got the right idea, mate.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.879
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

40:55.880 --> 40:59.639
The Irish,
they had the right idea.

40:59.640 --> 41:03.639
They tarred and feathered the
informants, tied 'em to lampposts...

41:04.320 --> 41:06.519
Come on! Please.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.599
Could get hypothermia.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.079
Fucking bird flu, maybe.

41:11.080 --> 41:12.399
Fuck off!

41:12.400 --> 41:16.399
Like turkeys at Christmas.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.159
Morning.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.479
Morning, sir.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.599
Yeah, fuck off.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.719
Our very own little Che Guevara!

41:31.720 --> 41:33.279
Who's that?

41:33.280 --> 41:33.999
The one on the T-shirts.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.199
Footballer?

41:35.200 --> 41:37.079
Yeah.

41:37.080 --> 41:41.079
What's your fucking hair like,
today?

41:45.600 --> 41:47.599
Where's Karen Maguire, please?

41:47.600 --> 41:48.439
Kiss my dick.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.479
Perhaps your mother has
better manners.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.919
I'll tear your fucking head off
and shit in your neck.

41:53.920 --> 41:55.679
I'm here.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.839
Your licence to sell alcohol
on these premises has suspended

41:58.840 --> 42:00.479
pending investigation.

42:00.480 --> 42:01.959
Investigation of what?

42:01.960 --> 42:05.639
Several possible contraventions
of the Licensing Act 2003,

42:05.640 --> 42:09.239
including letting patrons
spend the night at the location.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.239
You don't have the right
to serve these.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.240
This is a
multi-agency operation.

42:13.241 --> 42:15.239
It's tobacco and alcohol too.
It's across the board.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.639
Fine! Go ahead, suspend the licence.

42:18.640 --> 42:19.879
We'll give the drink away.

42:19.880 --> 42:20.799
What?!

42:20.800 --> 42:22.759
We'll give it away.
We can take the hit.

42:22.760 --> 42:26.759
This place doesn't close. Ever.
You won't starve us out.

42:28.400 --> 42:32.399
I'll have a triple voddie,
Rockefeller.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.119
Could you help me out, please?

42:45.120 --> 42:49.119
I've been in here since Tuesday.

42:52.360 --> 42:55.799
Could you not put a little more
on the deposit?

42:55.800 --> 42:58.599
For an extra 2,000
you could get this one.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.719
It has a downstairs toilet.
Be perfect for me.

43:00.720 --> 43:01.799
You?

43:01.800 --> 43:04.879
You're going to have to
get used to the idea

43:04.880 --> 43:07.639
that this could be
a permanent living arrangement.

43:07.640 --> 43:10.839
You're welcome to stay until you
sort out alternative accommodation,

43:10.840 --> 43:14.839
but for the first time in my life,
I could be approved for a mortgage

43:15.000 --> 43:17.399
and it's for my family's future,
only.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.159
We may never get our house back.

43:19.240 --> 43:23.159
You wouldn't cast a destitute
pensioner out onto the streets?

43:23.160 --> 43:27.159
If I had to, yeah.

43:27.720 --> 43:28.839
Jackson Powell?

43:28.840 --> 43:29.639
Yeah?

43:29.640 --> 43:31.874
We're from Operation New Start.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.919
You claimed income support
whilst under going teacher training.

43:38.120 --> 43:39.759
Yes, yes, but that's...

43:39.760 --> 43:43.759
You also received a maintenance
grant to the sum of Â£2,906.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.519
No, no. It's not...
You don't under...

43:46.520 --> 43:49.039
and a teacher trainee bursary
to the sum of Â£6,000.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.599
You can't expect a man
who has family to provide for

43:51.600 --> 43:52.719
to live off that alone.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.039
On family tax credits

43:56.040 --> 44:00.039
over a period of four years.

44:03.560 --> 44:07.079
You're not listening to me.
My family need it.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.399
Every penny goes on our survival!
I'm like you.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.379
An honest working man.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.122
That's the last of it.

44:30.715 --> 44:32.479
Micky...

44:32.480 --> 44:36.199
I'm... sorry...
We owe you big time.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.319
If circumstances were different,
we'd love you to stay...

44:38.320 --> 44:40.038
I could babysit...

44:40.039 --> 44:42.684
No, get the fuck out!
Get a fucking life!

44:45.600 --> 44:48.919
Don't have to tell me twice.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.559
You going somewhere?

44:50.560 --> 44:51.999
I'm moving out.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.999
You all are. Council-sponsored
court-sanctioned eviction order.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.839
I'm being prosecuted.
Can you believe that?

45:04.840 --> 45:07.639
He invited them in,
made them a cup tea,

45:07.640 --> 45:10.439
which, by the way,
I've noticed neither has touched,

45:10.440 --> 45:12.639
and offered a light snack
for the privilege.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.159
They've made a mistake.
We're not dole scroungers.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.399
There's no point.
I'm signing off, anyway.

45:17.400 --> 45:18.959
I'm a qualified teacher now.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.519
I've got a post at St Morrissey's...

45:20.520 --> 45:23.999
My husband has no comment.
Both of you,

45:24.000 --> 45:27.639
out of my fucking house now.

45:27.640 --> 45:31.639
Not another word!

45:36.200 --> 45:40.199
We'll be in touch.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.999
Did you see the way
he just looked at me?

45:43.000 --> 45:46.999
Like they would Frank Gallagher! How
fucking dare they? I'll fix this.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.559
That's fine, then, isn't it?

45:49.560 --> 45:53.559
Just in case, put this pot
away somewhere safe.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.080
Cos after that lot get
through with us, at

45:56.081 --> 45:58.079
least we'll have something
left to piss in.

45:58.440 --> 45:59.119
Pasta do you for lunch?

45:59.120 --> 46:01.759
I can't stand
feckin' Italian food...

46:01.760 --> 46:05.759
Pasta would be lovely.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.439
Four quid! Come on!
Can't sell them in the shop.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.599
Look at 'em all. What have we done?

46:17.600 --> 46:19.359
Come on, boys!
Get your pennies out!

46:20.840 --> 46:22.879
God knows.

46:22.880 --> 46:26.039
Pint and an orange.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.759
Put a large voddie in it.

46:27.760 --> 46:31.759
Bairn's got to get
used to it sometime.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.199
Go on, what you having?

46:37.200 --> 46:39.959
No, you're all right, thanks,
I'm fine.

46:47.840 --> 46:50.479
For fuck's sake,
is it panto season

46:50.480 --> 46:52.159
What have you done, Frank?

46:52.160 --> 46:55.079
Nothing. I've just... had me fill,
that's all.

46:55.080 --> 46:55.639
Frank?

46:55.640 --> 46:58.719
I haven't done anything!

46:58.720 --> 47:00.599
You're refusing a free drink?

47:00.600 --> 47:02.679
I'm not... I'm just...

47:02.680 --> 47:04.239
He's got a guilty conscience.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.119
About what? You threw me out.

47:07.120 --> 47:08.199
He's lying!
Can't even look me in the eye.

47:10.480 --> 47:11.199
Swear on the kids' lives.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.159
I swear.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.079
Swear on Man City.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.279
I swear.

47:15.280 --> 47:19.119
On your mother's memory.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.719
Grass!

47:22.720 --> 47:24.279
She's got us over a barrel.
If I don't...

47:24.280 --> 47:26.119
Fucking hell!

47:26.120 --> 47:28.039
No, listen!
If I don't weigh her in with info,

47:28.040 --> 47:30.679
she's going to fucking
hang me out to dry.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.079
Well, come on, then!

47:35.080 --> 47:36.519
Come on!

47:37.560 --> 47:40.479
Bring it on, you pack of hyenas!

47:40.480 --> 47:44.479
Got fuck all to lose, anyway!
Come on!

47:45.077 --> 47:47.239
I'm just a fucking punchbag,
aren't I?

47:49.350 --> 47:52.469
One man's torture is another
man's justified measures.

47:52.470 --> 47:55.509
I mean, I don't know if I believe
in punishment for it's own sake.

47:55.510 --> 47:57.469
I'm more a rehabilitation
man myself.

47:57.470 --> 48:00.789
I'd have no conscience about it.

48:00.790 --> 48:04.229
I want to see him suffer.
Two-faced grassing bastard!

48:04.230 --> 48:07.549
They might cut your knob off.
You can still live knobless.

48:07.550 --> 48:10.429
Always thought it'd cause you
to bleed to death,

48:10.430 --> 48:12.909
but apparently not.

48:12.910 --> 48:16.909
You can't kill Frank.
It'd be like drowning a puppy.

48:16.910 --> 48:18.820
I've drowned loads of puppies.

48:18.866 --> 48:20.549
Trust me, it's fuck-all like this.

48:20.550 --> 48:22.829
Still carrying a torch
for him, are we?

48:22.830 --> 48:26.029
Yeah I don't want him murdered,
so I'm carrying a torch for him.

48:26.030 --> 48:27.309
Is that your logic?

48:27.310 --> 48:30.189
There's loads of people
I don't want murdered,

48:30.190 --> 48:32.589
so that must make me
a right slapper

48:32.590 --> 48:34.789
'It does turn you
into a soprano, though.'

48:34.790 --> 48:36.749
You know, high voice and all that.

48:36.750 --> 48:40.349
Sopranos used to be dead
valuable in history.

48:40.350 --> 48:43.229
When I say soprano,
I do mean castrato, obviously.

48:45.990 --> 48:49.509
The Pope had a whole choir
of them in the 16th century.

48:52.990 --> 48:56.989
Burn me, shoot me, drown me
at sea! I don't care what you do,

48:57.070 --> 49:00.709
but stop fucking talking!

49:00.710 --> 49:04.589
Punishing him for its own sake makes
no sense. How does it benefit us?

49:04.590 --> 49:06.869
It isn't supposed to benefit us.

49:06.870 --> 49:09.149
Maybe it is.

49:09.150 --> 49:11.869
Look, he spied for them, yeah?
Why can't he spy for us?

49:11.870 --> 49:14.509
Find out what they're
up to, bring it here?

49:14.510 --> 49:17.589
And maybe pass on some duff
information to them,

49:17.590 --> 49:18.668
while he's at it?

49:18.707 --> 49:21.069
What, Frank Gallagher ...
double agent?!

49:21.070 --> 49:25.069
Fuck me, we must be desperate!

49:28.150 --> 49:29.989
Look out, Mata Hari's
on the case

49:29.990 --> 49:33.829
Ha-fucking-ha
I don't have to do this.

49:33.830 --> 49:36.949
Shouldn't have blabbed your fucking
mouth off in the first place!

49:36.950 --> 49:40.189
You owe us, all of us. Big time.

49:40.190 --> 49:42.669
I know... that!

49:42.670 --> 49:46.469
That's why I'm trying
to put things right, aren't I?

49:46.470 --> 49:50.029
Finding out what they're
up to so you...

49:50.030 --> 49:52.989
wehave got a fighting
chance of stopping them.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.989
Good luck.

50:04.830 --> 50:08.389
Big, big, big plans.

50:08.390 --> 50:09.869
Pray tell.

50:09.870 --> 50:10.989
It's bribery.

50:10.990 --> 50:14.189
Need to keep a close
eye on your team.

50:14.190 --> 50:16.909
Someone on the inside's passing
info in exchange for readies.

50:16.910 --> 50:19.389
Get Frank another drink, yeah?

50:19.390 --> 50:22.069
I think it helps him to talk
more... freely.

50:22.070 --> 50:24.269
OK.

50:24.270 --> 50:28.269
So Frank, what sort of information
are they supplying exactly?

50:28.550 --> 50:32.269
It's like addresses of where
you're going to swoop next.

50:32.270 --> 50:34.469
When are you swooping?

50:34.470 --> 50:37.389
You know, matter of interest?

50:37.390 --> 50:40.349
Carmen! Carmen!

50:40.350 --> 50:44.309
I couldn't find you!

50:44.310 --> 50:46.589
I have no sympathy or time for this.

50:46.590 --> 50:47.829
I love you!

50:47.830 --> 50:51.149
I used to be at
your beck and call...

50:51.150 --> 50:54.189
Great

50:54.190 --> 50:56.269
Carmen may be some time.

50:56.270 --> 51:00.269
I'm in no rush.

51:00.710 --> 51:04.709
All right, love. Your virtue's
safe with me. I may need glasses,

51:05.430 --> 51:09.429
but I'm not totally Stevie Wonder.

51:11.870 --> 51:14.718
Where the fuck
has Carmen got to?

51:14.796 --> 51:16.585
We won't see her now.

51:16.718 --> 51:19.269
This always happens
when he shows up

51:19.270 --> 51:22.269
and she falls for it every time.

51:22.270 --> 51:26.269
Husband. Going through a divorce.

51:26.270 --> 51:30.069
He's a drunk, a womaniser.

51:30.070 --> 51:32.029
He'll have had his way with her

51:32.030 --> 51:34.949
and then run back
to the younger model.

51:34.950 --> 51:37.309
Men are bastards!

51:37.310 --> 51:41.309
Do you have a little lady crush?

51:46.390 --> 51:49.909
I, er... I touched her boob once,

51:49.910 --> 51:53.549
while she was asleep.
The left one.

51:53.550 --> 51:57.029
I just... brushed my palm

51:57.030 --> 51:59.291
across her nipple.

52:02.950 --> 52:04.869
I sleep on it now.

52:04.870 --> 52:08.709
Hard to tell,
cos I'm so pissed, but...

52:08.710 --> 52:11.486
I might've just come in me pants.

52:12.870 --> 52:15.189
You're all stuffed, though.
You know that.

52:15.190 --> 52:16.669
What?

52:16.670 --> 52:20.669
It's political, like immigration

52:20.670 --> 52:23.469
No government can be seen

52:23.470 --> 52:26.429
to be supporting benefits.

52:26.430 --> 52:30.429
The underbelly is a cancer.

52:33.310 --> 52:36.109
Shall we have another drink?

52:36.110 --> 52:37.149
No!

52:37.150 --> 52:40.149
Go on! You know you want to.

52:40.150 --> 52:41.829
Go on!

52:41.830 --> 52:45.829
All right. Then we call
it a day. I need to, er...

52:46.350 --> 52:50.349
Leave the table here.

53:10.390 --> 53:11.429
Where's Feeney?

53:16.950 --> 53:17.949
What you doing?

53:17.950 --> 53:19.669
I just... I...

53:19.670 --> 53:23.229
I dropped me glasses.

53:23.230 --> 53:27.229
You look shagged.

53:41.710 --> 53:44.309
You going somewhere?

53:44.310 --> 53:48.189
I don't know who you are anymore.

53:48.190 --> 53:49.749
I'm going somewhere!

53:49.750 --> 53:51.669
I don't want to be
like everyone else!

53:51.670 --> 53:55.669
I want two parents.

53:56.310 --> 53:59.069
You're so keen to move on.
I think you should.

53:59.070 --> 54:02.429
You're not that stupid!
15 years of marriage?

54:02.430 --> 54:03.869
15 years?

54:03.870 --> 54:07.189
Letitia! I wouldn't want you
looking down your nose at us.

54:07.190 --> 54:10.429
Maybe one of your better
class of mates can put you up.

54:10.430 --> 54:11.469
In.

54:11.470 --> 54:14.189
In!

54:14.190 --> 54:18.189
I won't be blackmailed!

54:25.830 --> 54:29.829
Not a fucking word!

54:37.550 --> 54:39.069
There you go, love.

54:39.070 --> 54:41.149
Cheers.

54:41.150 --> 54:44.909
Come on, I've earned it!

54:44.910 --> 54:48.909
If I had my way, you'd be propping
up a bridge somewhere by now.

54:49.510 --> 54:52.909
What, you going to stuff
your gums with orange peel?

54:52.910 --> 54:56.589
Tell me Luca Brazi
sleeps with the fishes?

54:56.590 --> 55:00.029
You don't scare me!

55:00.030 --> 55:01.709
We're fucked!

55:01.710 --> 55:04.229
They're going to evict
as many as they can,

55:04.230 --> 55:06.429
but there's no new tenants.

55:06.430 --> 55:10.429
No-one's moving in. They're going
to keep the houses empty, permanent.

55:10.550 --> 55:11.949
Well, that's stupid.

55:11.950 --> 55:14.535
No, that's clever.
Left empty, the houses'll rot.

55:14.536 --> 55:16.185
But then no-one'll
want to live here.

55:16.193 --> 55:17.747
Exactly what they want.

55:17.794 --> 55:20.232
They're looking to shut down
the whole estate.

55:20.284 --> 55:23.455
No houses, no pub,
no punters, no people.

55:23.705 --> 55:26.749
This'll be one of those places
people used to live.

55:26.750 --> 55:29.349
Well, I for one
am lying down to no bully.

55:29.350 --> 55:30.229
I'm with you.

55:30.285 --> 55:32.076
We need a plan.

55:34.310 --> 55:36.629
I wear them for reading sometimes.

55:36.630 --> 55:38.709
I wear contacts.

55:38.710 --> 55:42.309
I need 'em for watching telly.

55:42.310 --> 55:43.549
I don't need glasses.

55:43.550 --> 55:47.549
I only wear them cos fellas can't
resist the slutty secretary look.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.042
How are we going to fight them?
They've got cops and dogs.

55:52.152 --> 55:53.431
They've got tasers.

55:53.456 --> 55:56.192
We need to be smart.
Guerrilla warfare.

55:56.270 --> 55:58.389
Yeah, French resistance!

55:58.390 --> 56:00.149
But... we're not French.

56:00.150 --> 56:02.686
We're all in the same fucking boat.

56:04.230 --> 56:07.685
'All right, so maybe
I was a bit premature.

56:07.755 --> 56:11.509
'These are difficult days.

56:11.510 --> 56:13.829
'You know, post banking crisis,

56:13.830 --> 56:17.669
'post comprehensive spending review,

56:17.670 --> 56:20.629
'cuts, cuts and more cuts.

56:20.630 --> 56:24.629
'And kick the living shit
out of the underbelly

56:25.110 --> 56:29.109
'cos they're least equipped
to defend themselves.

56:30.030 --> 56:33.669
'The more things change,

56:33.670 --> 56:36.094
'the more they stay the same, yeah?

56:51.710 --> 56:54.149
'Society is dead.

56:54.150 --> 56:58.069
'Long live society.'

56:58.070 --> 57:00.509
Thanks to you, these people
have lost their homes.

57:00.510 --> 57:01.629
Â£150,000?!

57:01.630 --> 57:05.149
That's her bonus, if she manages
to permanently board up 120 houses.

57:05.150 --> 57:06.589
Partner couldn't make it again?

57:06.590 --> 57:08.284
'I can't do it on my own.'

57:08.300 --> 57:09.109
I'll mess it up!

57:09.110 --> 57:11.429
I'll mess it up! You will if you
carry on ignoring your baby.

57:11.430 --> 57:13.709
Upset by a couple
of evictions, are you?

57:13.710 --> 57:16.669
Ten years from now, this
place will be wasteland!

57:16.670 --> 57:20.029
She has destroyed people's lives.
She's caused total mayhem!

57:20.030 --> 57:24.029
You know what hormones are like? I
really need to go and ride me boy.

57:24.913 --> 57:26.697
Baby!

58:00.110 --> 58:04.109

58:09.110 --> 58:12.469
There's spunk stains on the
pillowcase and dried-on lubricant!

58:12.470 --> 58:16.352
It's a working house.

58:17.477 --> 58:19.709
Have you got a little stiffie
under there for me?

58:19.750 --> 58:21.820
No, I've really not!

58:23.310 --> 58:30.949
You'll come round eventually!
