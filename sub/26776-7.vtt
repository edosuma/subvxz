- Is that the "everything's
totally cool" alarm?

21:20.178 --> 21:22.114
- Hey!
I got the stingers out!

21:22.180 --> 21:25.384
What is with the alarm?

21:28.387 --> 21:32.858
- Is this a "everything's
totally cool" power outage?

21:32.924 --> 21:34.593
- It's okay! I think
there's a flashlight

21:34.660 --> 21:36.161
in this drawer
full of blasters.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.996
- Jasper, no no no!

21:43.802 --> 21:45.470
- Sorry.
