Go on a run.

00:03.300 --> 00:05.700
Run for our lives.

00:05.700 --> 00:09.190
We'll tear down in every
fence and every wall.

Peter Rabbit.

00:09.890 --> 00:10.660
Run through the fields.

00:10.660 --> 00:15.480
Run wild and free, and grab
a piece of every radish

01:34.630 --> 01:38.590
PETER RABBIT: I know
you're out here somewhere.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.009
I found you, Benjamin!

Found you!

01:59.070 --> 02:00.720
LILY: Oh, not fair.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.480
If I could tunnel like
Benjamin, you'd never find me.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.710
PETER RABBIT: Uh,
tunnelling's no big deal.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.550
LILY: Can you show
me how to do it?

02:08.550 --> 02:10.280
BENJAMIN: Of course we will.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.620
We'll teach you to tunnel.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.790
Won't we, Peter?

02:12.790 --> 02:13.920
PETER RABBIT:
(HESITANT) Um, yeah.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.380
But first, I-- oh,
I just remembered.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.400
I promised my mum I'd
be home for lunch.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.270
See you later!

LILY: That's strange.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.329
Why did he run off like that?

02:25.329 --> 02:28.450
BENJAMIN: I mean, he didn't
even ask us over for lunch.

02:28.450 --> 02:29.410
Oh, well.

02:29.410 --> 02:33.620
If you need me, I'll be
at the blackberry bush.

PETER RABBIT: (PANTING)
Dig, dig, dig.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.600
That's not a tunnel.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.030
That's a dent.

02:56.030 --> 02:58.430
There must be something
about it in here.

02:58.430 --> 02:59.850
How do I dig a tunnel?

03:02.520 --> 03:03.350
[SIGH] Nothing.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.360
I'll never be good tunneler.

Never say never, Peter.

03:09.820 --> 03:10.660
PETER RABBIT: [GASP] Mum!

03:10.660 --> 03:13.390
JOSEPHINE RABBIT: You know, your
father wasn't much of a tunnel

03:13.390 --> 03:15.820
either when I first met
him, but he still dug

03:15.820 --> 03:18.160
out this whole burrow for us.

03:18.160 --> 03:18.960
PETER RABBIT: He did?

03:18.960 --> 03:20.579
JOSEPHINE RABBIT: Yes.

03:20.579 --> 03:22.890
Actually, he dug eight burrows.

03:22.890 --> 03:27.110
The first seven fell
down, but this one--

03:27.110 --> 03:28.730
this one is home.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.220
PETER RABBIT: So how did
he ever learn how to dig?

03:31.220 --> 03:33.530
JOSEPHINE RABBIT: Well, he
kept trying until he found

03:33.530 --> 03:36.110
a way that worked for
him, just like you'll

03:36.110 --> 03:37.690
find a way that works for you.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.870
PETER RABBIT: Oh, yeah.

03:43.870 --> 03:45.890
These paws can find a way.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.360

digger in the whole--

wasn't doing anything.

03:50.940 --> 03:54.500
LILY: Peter, I think something's
happened to Benjamin.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.200
Come on.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.610
And that's when
I heard a scream.

04:01.610 --> 04:04.390
Like, aaaah!

04:04.390 --> 04:09.490
Except quieter, with an
echo like, aah aah, aah.

04:09.490 --> 04:11.930
So I knew something must
have happened to him.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.510
What are you doing?

04:13.510 --> 04:15.220
PETER RABBIT: Rescuing Benjamin.

04:15.220 --> 04:16.060
What are you doing?

04:16.060 --> 04:20.290
LILY: But I thought we'd
talk out a plan first.

04:20.290 --> 04:21.240
No?

04:21.240 --> 04:23.190
OK, coming.

place for knitting, Lily.

04:38.970 --> 04:41.300
It's in case we get lost.

We can just follow the
wool to find our way back.

not going to get lost.

has been busy.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.020

Benjamin dug all this.

05:04.020 --> 05:07.570
Question is, who did?

05:07.570 --> 05:09.550
PETER RABBIT: Oh, I'll tell
you who dug these tunnels.

05:09.550 --> 05:10.530
My dad!

the wrong way, but these tunnels

06:28.990 --> 06:30.280
your dad made--

06:30.280 --> 06:32.630
well, they're not
very good, are they?

well, they're old.

ever think about is food.

Benjamin eating blackberries?

06:46.170 --> 06:47.560

06:47.560 --> 06:50.710
PETER RABBIT: So he
must've drunk these.

trail, we'll find him.

the plan first this time?

07:33.980 --> 07:35.010
PETER RABBIT: Of course.

is feeling much better.

it, that was fun.

How do you get so good
at doing bandages?

08:13.010 --> 08:14.630

08:14.630 --> 08:16.070
Practise makes perfect.

08:16.070 --> 08:18.660
I know that for a fact.

back to where we came.

if we get lost again?

08:25.640 --> 08:28.170
There are so many tunnels.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.810

08:29.810 --> 08:31.280

plan for the backup plan?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.340

how we can get out.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.810

09:03.810 --> 09:04.610
Won't you, Peter?

09:07.280 --> 09:09.710
PETER RABBIT: There's
something you should know.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.210
I can't dig tunnels.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.900
LILY: I can't believe
you never told us, Peter.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.360
BENJAMIN: I thought you
were good at everything.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.690
PETER RABBIT: Sorry.

09:26.690 --> 09:28.570
Dad never got around
to showing me how.

09:28.570 --> 09:31.600

it's time you learned.

rabbit never gives up.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.090
I know I can work this out.

09:56.130 --> 09:57.190
LILY: Wow.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.460
PETER RABBIT: What?

09:58.460 --> 10:00.040
Have you found something
about tunnelling?

10:00.040 --> 10:00.740
LILY: Huh?

10:00.740 --> 10:01.510
Uh, no.

10:01.510 --> 10:04.130
Sorry, I was just
reading about your dad.

10:04.130 --> 10:05.510
He was such an adventurer.

10:05.510 --> 10:08.110
PETER RABBIT: Yup,
he was one of a kind.

10:08.110 --> 10:11.180
Always did things his way,
and that's what I have to do.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.610
Do this my way.

10:12.610 --> 10:16.490
Like using that
to dig our tunnel.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.800
Give me a hand.

pretty, but it's working.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.470
PETER RABBIT: Come on, you two.

No time to lose.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.110

aware, and you'll succeed
