WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:05.404
(dogs barking).

00:13.247 --> 00:14.613
JESSIE: I'm getting
ready to head up river.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.449
I'm gonna try to
secure a large portion
of my winters firewood.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.052
Right now, in the
middle of summer.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.988
Last year, I got about three
to four cords of firewood.

00:23.591 --> 00:27.192
I'm thinking that I can, uh,
change some techniques up and
switch some things up this

00:27.228 --> 00:30.229
year and get at least
twice that much.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.698
<i> NARRATOR: For Jessie Holmes,</i>
<i> staying ahead of the seasons</i>

00:32.733 --> 00:35.267
<i> is key to his</i>
<i> lifestyle in Nenana.</i>

00:35.770 --> 00:38.470
<i> After building a raft to</i>
<i> haul firewood before winter,</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:41.306
<i> Jessie will now head out</i>
<i> to harvest the resource.</i>

00:41.942 --> 00:45.344
<i> But first, he must</i>
<i> load a final, yet heavy</i>
<i> piece of equipment.</i>

00:45.946 --> 00:48.580
JESSIE: I wanna bring the
four-wheeler with me because
there's places where I can

00:48.616 --> 00:52.317
save my back if I got this
four-wheeler, and I can
let it do all the work.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.987
The whole thing is,
I wanna get more wood,

00:55.022 --> 00:58.157
but I wanna use less of my
youth that's fading quickly.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.759
Yes, are you helping me?

01:00.795 --> 01:03.345
This is gonna be the
first time I've ever put a
four-wheeler in the boat,

01:03.397 --> 01:06.198
and I know it's
possible, but, uh, I just
never done it before.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.700
I got some boards,
some plywood.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.236
For that, I should be able
to make a rough ramp that

01:11.272 --> 01:14.273
I can put together and
take apart really easily.

01:14.308 --> 01:18.944
Now, this is starting
to look like something
that's a little dangerous,

01:18.979 --> 01:21.447
but not too dangerous.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.783
The one thing that makes this
kind of sketchy to get on here
is that my breaks don't work

01:24.819 --> 01:26.218
good on this four-wheeler.

01:26.253 --> 01:29.021
I'm gonna have to kinda,
um, roll into a stop.

01:44.605 --> 01:50.809
(theme music plays).

02:21.208 --> 02:22.774
All right. I got the
four-wheeler in.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.743
That's pretty cool
seeing that in there.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.629
As long as I can get
it out, I can do some
damage with that thing.

02:29.216 --> 02:32.551
Only thing to stop me from
coming, uh, home with
anything is amount of work

02:32.586 --> 02:34.186
I'm willing to put in.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.155
So, I'm willing to
put the work in.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.524
I think I'm gonna come back
with a nice load of logs.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.359
Load up.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.894
Come on, Temp, load up.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.395
Yay, you brought your ball.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.430
Yay, we're gone.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.099
We got a long
way to go, girls.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.300
We got a lot to do.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.202
So, we're outta here.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.175
SUE: I wanna live 60-mile
an hour with flames coming
out of my hair till the day

02:56.260 --> 02:58.977
I'm not here, but that
takes planning.

03:13.861 --> 03:19.798
What I am doing out here
today is looking for a place
to start a new safety trail in

03:19.833 --> 03:23.101
case something bad
ever happens at Kavik,
and I have to get away.

03:24.071 --> 03:28.640
With the work that's happening
on the north slope that's only
15 miles from camp to

03:28.676 --> 03:30.842
one on the oil fields.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.446
If a 50-year-old fat
chick comes in, "Help me!"

03:34.481 --> 03:36.014
They're gonna help me.

03:36.050 --> 03:40.586
With 15 miles I
estimate three barrels,
every five miles,

03:40.854 --> 03:43.355
I drop a barrel in
that container.

03:43.390 --> 03:47.759
You have a tent, you have
a source of heat, a source
to cook, dehydrated food.

03:48.195 --> 03:53.632
You've got the basic elements
to keep yourself alive
and go the next five miles.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.904
It's sort of like leaving
yourself breadcrumbs so
that you can breadcrumb

03:58.939 --> 04:01.640
safety your way somewhere.

04:04.211 --> 04:07.379
I'm gonna get on the chest
waders, go down the river.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.115
I have a coal seam down
there, and that's gonna
be my source of heat

04:10.150 --> 04:12.784
to pack in the barrels.

04:12.886 --> 04:16.888
Over here, that's the
area I had gone, that
had my coal seam.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.424
But it's buried.

04:19.460 --> 04:22.894
Just before 7:00 this morning,
we had a 6.5 earthquake.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.963
That was a really
good tumbler.

04:24.999 --> 04:28.100
Where that dark mud is,
that's an area that let go.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.236
So you've got some
instability happening.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.705
So, I'm gonna look
before I leap.

04:33.741 --> 04:37.309
Even if I saw a coal
right there, that,
that's too unstable.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.311
I see water running
down it now.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.213
I'm not interested.

04:41.248 --> 04:44.316
I wanna get the coal, but
I don't wanna get it so
bad that I end my life.

04:45.069 --> 04:48.086
So, I've gotta be careful
about where I choose.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.590
So, what I'm gonna be doing
is looking down this whole
escarpment as I am going back

04:51.625 --> 04:55.927
down to Kavik, and I'm
gonna search for those
dark stains coming out.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.830
That's gonna tell me
there's coal in there.

04:58.866 --> 05:03.068
Bearing in mind, once I find
it, I've gotta cross the
river, cross the current.

05:03.103 --> 05:08.874
Does it seem silly to go and
risk my life to get a little
bit of coal that I might need?

05:08.909 --> 05:12.377
Well, it's only as
silly as that moment
that you do need it

05:12.413 --> 05:14.646
and didn't decide to do that.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.848
So, it's a sunny day.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.084
Let's see what I can see.

05:21.355 --> 05:24.890
RICKO: Just accomplishing
things really keeps me alive
and keeps my culture alive

05:24.925 --> 05:27.125
because it's use
it or lose it.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.935
I'll get this up here
on the table and look
it over real well.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.738
I wanna do some fishing today.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.875
<i> NARRATOR: Ricko DeWilde has</i>
<i> spent several days with his</i>
<i> son Skylar and daughter</i>

05:43.911 --> 05:47.879
<i> Skarlett in the Huslia</i>
<i> wilderness, showing them</i>
<i> the Athabaskan way of life.</i>

05:48.382 --> 05:52.284

05:55.456 --> 05:57.589
RICKO: There's a
lot of fish right now in the
water, and the water is low.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.191
So, it's not too
hard to get at them.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.692
I'm gonna use a fishnet.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.295
There's pike, there's
white fish, there's
grayling, there's salmon.

06:03.297 --> 06:06.498
I'll be fishing for food
and also for trapping bait.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.434
This net looks real good.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.969
I'm gonna use this
for the salmon.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.872
In addition to the
longer larger net that
I have for salmon,

06:13.907 --> 06:17.442
I may use an older
traditional net that my
mom had made out of twine.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.712
It's specifically for
grayling and smaller fish.

06:21.281 --> 06:25.150
This net's a little more
harder to manage because
it's such small light mesh.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.319
Took her probably
a good two weeks.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.121
It's some kinda art
that I wish I knew.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.724
Because it's basically a
strong tool of survival.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.193
It looks like it's
in perfect condition.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.297
I'm gonna head down
to the boat and head
down to the slew.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.733
My mom was, like,
number one for fishing.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.402
She taught me
everything I know.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.404
So, if I fail at putting
fish on the table,

06:45.439 --> 06:47.939
then I guess I'm just not
soaking up the knowledge.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.343
No better day than this
to get out on the water.

CHIP: If you wanna
have good luck, there's
two things you need.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.352
You need to be prepared and
then you need an opportunity.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.543
I don't know.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.711
If your motor ain't
running, you don't go.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.815
Maybe we should just instead
of, uh, me driving this with
the kayak and you driving the

07:29.850 --> 07:32.651
big boat back, maybe we
throw this in the big boat.

07:32.820 --> 07:36.354
AGNES: All the little boats
go in the big boat, and
we just boogie outta here?

07:36.840 --> 07:38.490
CHIP: Our problem is
just the weather window.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.192
If we don't beat this
weather window, we're
stuck here in Kotzebue,

07:40.194 --> 07:41.293
and then there's trouble.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.395
AGNES: And it's also gonna
get dark in a few hours.

07:43.430 --> 07:47.833
CHIP: We could put a boat in
a boat in a boat, and boat
these boats to the Kiwalik.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.268
Are you, are you up to that?

07:50.304 --> 07:51.803

a lot of troubles with

and I've had these
kind of problems before
with other machines.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.792
I can see that I can
solve this problem.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.627
What I can't solve is the
weather that's coming.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.929
We'll drive down
there, it might take
us six or eight hours,

08:17.965 --> 08:20.765
but we gotta get there
before the blow, and
then I can fix the motor.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.602
Push me out, and let's
see if we're balanced.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.938
Oh, yeah, that'll be good.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.406
What do you think, huh?

08:28.442 --> 08:30.942
AGNES: Yeah, that
simplifies everything.

JESSIE: One thing a
person loves in life is a
little bit of challenge.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.936
Life with no challenge
is just boring.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.817
I'm going 30 miles up river,
my search to find some log.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.120
The most weight I
ever had in the boat.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.957
So, definitely gonna have
to take it nice and easy
and see how that handles.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.127
You definitely don't wanna
make any kind of mistakes

09:22.162 --> 09:24.529
when you're out there
with a load like this.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.632
The stakes, when you
got a load like this, are
life and death type deal.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.369
So, main thing is to
be safe, and take my
time getting up there.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.378
(crash, scraping).

09:51.191 --> 09:54.526
).

10:03.170 --> 10:05.570
JESSIE: I'm stuck
on a sandbar.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.209
I'm stuck in the middle
of a (bleep) river here.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.647
Oh, my God.

10:15.732 --> 10:17.949
(bleep).

10:18.051 --> 10:21.286
The Tanana River is just
a wild-braided river.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.989
There's lots of
sandbars, gravel bars.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.926
The river is constantly
changing and depositing
new sandbars in places.

10:29.296 --> 10:33.765
The river's been dropping
real quick and wasn't quite
paying attention to the water.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.002
Now I'm stuck on a sandbar.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.571
Thousands of
pounds in the boat.

10:39.606 --> 10:44.576
It's not a very good
situation to be in with as
much weight in the boat.

10:49.716 --> 10:53.151
Ugh. (sighs).

10:57.190 --> 10:59.457
(bleep).

11:02.162 --> 11:05.330
Still pretty far away
from the deep water.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.767
That's where the deep
water is, it's where
I gotta get it to.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.971
The only way you're gonna
really get off a sandbar if
you're really stuck is you

11:13.006 --> 11:18.410
gotta get out in the water
and you got to work, and
pry, and pull, and push.

11:18.812 --> 11:23.815
And you got to physically
try to lift that boat up and
scoot it an inch at a time.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.319
The boat's moving, it
looks like I'm gonna
be able to get out.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.723
There, it's starting to
get some more flotation,
keep working it this way.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.560
Ugh.

11:35.662 --> 11:38.029
I'm starting to feel a
little bit of current here.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.132
Oh, yeah, I'm in
some deep water now.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.134
That's not what I
wanted to have happen.

11:43.170 --> 11:46.004
But I'm out, and
that's what matters.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.875
Ah, I'm a little bit
tired now though.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.711
I'm gonna keep going up river.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.246
Keep my eyes out really
good reading the water
because I can't afford

11:55.282 --> 11:57.615
another mistake like that.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.521
Really dangerous when I'm
gonna be coming down here
with a big giant raft

12:03.557 --> 12:06.491
loaded with thousands
of pounds of wood on it.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.461
If I get that stuck on
something like that, I
ain't getting it off.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.062
You can't take shortcuts.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.965
You can't take any risk when
it's low water like this.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.836
There ain't no amount
of wood I can put on that
raft that's worth my life.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.042
I'm about 20 miles
up the river.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.577
I'm getting up here.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.512
Starting to see
some dead trees.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.815
Oh, man, there's a lot
of firewood right there.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.288
Oh, yeah, there's a mother
lode of wood back here.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.694
Main thing I got to do now
is get this four-wheeler off.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.543
Now those breaks
would be nice.

13:02.749 --> 13:06.851
Well, I almost got it.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.963
Now that I've got the
four-wheeler off the boat,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.832
I'm gonna go up and
retrieve my raft.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.735
It's about 10 more miles
up to hook up to the raft,
bring it back down here.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.670
Then, I'm gonna get
started logging.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.272
Let's go.
Big adventure.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.607
Yeah, we're on
a big adventure.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.478
RICKO: I'm Alaska's people.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.614
I don't have no ownership
of Alaska, but Alaska owns
my heart, that's for sure.

13:45.175 --> 13:48.743
The name of the game today
is get as many fish as
I can, as quick as I can.

13:49.379 --> 13:50.678
I got a big net with me today.

13:50.714 --> 13:52.413
I'm gonna put that at
the mouth of the slew,

13:52.516 --> 13:54.349
and basically going
after chum salmon.

13:54.384 --> 13:55.750
And I got this smaller net.

13:55.785 --> 13:57.819
I wanna get that back
in the slew away from
the spawning salmon,

13:57.854 --> 14:00.421
and hopefully get some
more edible smaller fish.

14:00.457 --> 14:03.458
There's a lot of opportunity
in the water right now, and
I wanna take advantage of it.

14:08.932 --> 14:11.733
I'm looking around for
good spots for putting
the fish net in.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.568
I don't wanna find a
place with too much weeds.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.403
I wanna have some depth to it.

14:18.575 --> 14:19.774
(beeping).

14:19.776 --> 14:21.442
Oh, (bleep).

14:22.279 --> 14:24.512
Got a hot water
signal coming on.

14:24.548 --> 14:26.014
Maybe weeds, I don't know.

14:26.049 --> 14:28.182
I'm gonna check it out.

14:28.218 --> 14:29.851
Out here, there's
no mechanics.

14:29.886 --> 14:32.120
I can't bring this motor in
to anyone to have it fixed.

14:32.155 --> 14:33.955
And I'm a long ways, I'm
100 miles from the village.

14:33.990 --> 14:36.391
So, hopefully it's
nothing major.

14:38.528 --> 14:40.929
Going back here in the slew,
I have got this stuff here.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.899
Hopefully didn't suck
any of this into the
water coolant system.

14:45.468 --> 14:49.704
So, I've got to see
if this thing will run

14:50.040 --> 14:52.574
without the bells going off.

14:59.883 --> 15:02.417
Problem solved so far.

15:02.919 --> 15:06.020
I'm glad because
I don't wanna be broke
down back in this slew.

15:06.189 --> 15:08.156
This is my only way home.

15:21.838 --> 15:25.073
This is a slew here
that we used to fish
when I was growing up.

15:25.241 --> 15:28.710
I'm thinking maybe put it,
post in here, and just string
that net out here for some

15:28.745 --> 15:31.012
chum and maybe get
some bigger pike.

15:31.047 --> 15:34.682
Then put the smaller net up
in the slew a little ways,
and hopefully get something.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.689
I don't have no one
to help me today.

15:41.725 --> 15:43.992
So, I just gotta
work a little harder.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.964
I just wanna get this
down deep enough to where
it doesn't come out.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.033
I don't wanna lose my net.

15:54.571 --> 15:57.572
I'll get another stake
in just to be safe.

16:03.346 --> 16:06.547
I'm just gonna paddle out
and let this net spool out.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.751
Gonna let the current kind
of do most of the work.

16:12.589 --> 16:15.423
Looks good so far.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.559
Oh (bleep).
I'm hung up right here.

16:18.795 --> 16:20.928
Ugh, there we go.

16:23.033 --> 16:25.733
Here, I will pull it
out just a little bit.

16:26.102 --> 16:30.371
Just like that.
That should be good.

16:31.007 --> 16:32.540
I'll let it sit.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.709
I'm gonna put
the other net in.

16:40.617 --> 16:42.350
Okay, that's good.

16:42.385 --> 16:44.619
String this off.

16:44.654 --> 16:47.021
You can see it's
already tangling.

16:47.057 --> 16:50.358
It's a little bit harder
to set because it's, uh,
old fashioned stuff here.

16:51.961 --> 16:53.928
Okay, it looks pretty good.

16:53.963 --> 16:55.997
Just gonna pull this tight.

16:56.032 --> 16:58.666
Okay.

16:58.702 --> 17:00.668
I'm gonna let this
net just sit here.

17:00.704 --> 17:02.704
The other one is
doing its job.

17:02.739 --> 17:05.306
And hopefully when I get
back and check em, I'll
have something in there.

17:09.045 --> 17:12.513
SUE: There's nothing
about me that says I'm
qualified to do what I do.

17:12.816 --> 17:15.049
I'm just fearless
about doing it.

17:24.327 --> 17:26.194
This is dark.

17:26.229 --> 17:28.563
Well, that's a (bleep)
place to try to get into.

17:28.865 --> 17:30.998
I definitely see an area
of interest right here,

17:31.034 --> 17:32.967
and it looks like it
might be pretty good.

17:33.002 --> 17:36.204
The only thing that
doesn't look good is how
to get across the river.

17:36.539 --> 17:40.641
<i> NARRATOR: In case an emergency</i>
<i> forces her to leave Kavik, Sue</i>
<i> will build a 15-mile safety</i>

17:40.677 --> 17:45.513
<i> trail to the haul road,</i>
<i> harvesting coal from the river</i>
<i> bank is key as it will provide</i>

17:45.548 --> 17:48.449
<i> a heat source to place</i>
<i> in the safety barrels.</i>

17:48.885 --> 17:51.986
SUE: I got clear water
here, and then it gets
a real greenish color.

17:52.021 --> 17:54.188
That's a, that's deep.

17:54.724 --> 17:57.158
I'm a little nervous
about it, to be honest.

17:57.193 --> 18:00.228
If I slip, I'll just be
one of the rocks down here
on the bottom of the river.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.030
Kavik will swallow me whole.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.099
So, I've got to be careful.

18:06.569 --> 18:10.271
Normally when you cross a
river, you wanna do your toes
pointed into the current.

18:10.940 --> 18:13.808
So, I'm gonna kinda
head that way.

18:14.077 --> 18:17.712
If the current gets
really strong, I'm gonna
have to change my tact.

18:19.082 --> 18:22.350
But I'm using the shovel
as sort of a walking stick.

18:26.623 --> 18:29.056
The current is
definitely picking up.

18:29.092 --> 18:32.059
It is really pushing on me.

18:34.164 --> 18:36.697
I don't know about this.

18:36.733 --> 18:40.034
I'm gonna try to go
further down enough.

18:42.305 --> 18:46.107
The nature of
the current is trying to
push me to the southwest.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.912
So, I'm gonna work with
nature rather than trying
to force nature to my will.

18:51.748 --> 18:53.981
Whenever I try to do
that, it doesn't work out.

18:54.017 --> 18:55.950
So, I'm gonna say,
"Right, Mother Nature,

18:55.985 --> 18:59.253
I'm just gonna take the
tact you're offering,
treat me nice."

19:02.458 --> 19:04.759
This bucket is
a big pain in my (bleep) ass.

19:06.763 --> 19:10.264
Ah.

19:11.501 --> 19:13.201
(bleep).

19:13.236 --> 19:15.636
No, you're not
gonna (bleep) win.

19:18.174 --> 19:19.640
Turn around.
Turn around.

19:19.676 --> 19:22.376
Don't fall!

19:23.146 --> 19:25.613
Bucket is gonna kill me.

19:25.648 --> 19:28.583
I cannot just sit here
getting beat up by a
(bleep) plastic bucket.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.088
Stay back there you
piece of (bleep).

19:35.825 --> 19:38.359
I live here because I
don't wanna have it easy.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.561
I live her because I
want the adventure.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.698
I want perhaps a little bit
of that thrill of danger.

19:44.334 --> 19:47.401
The coal is not gonna
jump in the bucket just
'cause I want it there.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.404
It's just like sitting at
home and hoping somebody
pays your water bill.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.240
Well, it doesn't
work that way.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.942
You gotta make the
effort to get the reward.

19:57.747 --> 20:00.314
(bleep) hell.
Losing my footing.

20:02.018 --> 20:04.185
Foot, footing.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.955
Gonna let some
(bleep) water get you?

20:07.991 --> 20:10.958
Not today, Sue.
Not (bleep) today.

20:12.695 --> 20:14.862
(bleep) dammit.

20:15.565 --> 20:18.866
Losing ground.

20:19.769 --> 20:20.868
Ahh.

20:22.238 --> 20:24.372
SUE: C

20:25.341 --> 20:28.943
Ahh. Get it. Ahh.

20:31.848 --> 20:36.450
Ahh. Get it. Ahh.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.322
Ahh. Ugh.

20:46.296 --> 20:49.096
Please, please let me make it.

20:49.332 --> 20:50.564
Please, let me make it.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.934
I'm trying so hard.

20:54.103 --> 20:56.737
Come on, Susie.
Get her done.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.476
Do not, do not lose it
at the last 10 feet.

21:04.414 --> 21:07.248
Ah! Ahh.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.983
(bleep).

21:18.227 --> 21:19.961
(bleep) did it.

21:22.365 --> 21:25.132
Little cold.

21:25.935 --> 21:29.236
Well, everything's giving
away underneath my feet.

21:35.244 --> 21:37.812
Okay, look at this.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.984
Oh, my gosh.

21:43.186 --> 21:45.152
This smells like
a gas station.

21:45.171 --> 21:48.055
This is exactly,
exactly what I want.

21:48.658 --> 21:51.525
This is really an
exciting coal find.

21:51.928 --> 21:54.829
It's not a lump of coal that
you're gonna take a match to.

21:54.864 --> 21:57.131
This is something
I'll have to form.

21:57.166 --> 21:59.700
But it's very oil-rich.

21:59.736 --> 22:04.905
I think if I get one good
bucket, that's enough for
me to start setting up

22:04.941 --> 22:07.808
the three barrels.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.518
It's time for me to get back.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.855
I've gotta scale it like
a little Billy-goat, and
then cross that river.

22:46.883 --> 22:48.682
Come on, Sue.

22:52.822 --> 22:54.955
You've been through the worst.

22:55.058 --> 22:56.924
Get it.

22:57.994 --> 23:00.995
You get a gold (bleep)
star tonight, girl.

23:08.337 --> 23:11.038
Fat old ladies rule.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.706
Woo.

23:13.876 --> 23:16.777
Holy cow. I think
I'm ready to pass out.

23:18.548 --> 23:21.715
One bucket of coal.

23:22.585 --> 23:25.019
Woo.

23:25.521 --> 23:27.755
That was some scary poop.

23:27.790 --> 23:30.024
But I did it and
I'm proud of myself.

23:30.059 --> 23:32.726
You know the goal is actually
that I never have to use it.

23:32.762 --> 23:36.597
But if I do or somebody
else, it's there,

23:36.699 --> 23:38.766
and all it's did was a
day of effort and maybe

23:38.801 --> 23:40.301
getting a little bit wet.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.336
Hell, maybe I needed a bath.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.775
It's a good day, a
monumental effort, and
a monumental pay off.

23:52.281 --> 23:54.648
JESSIE: I'm always pushing
barriers in everything I do

23:54.684 --> 23:57.351
because it keeps me strong
and it keeps me moving forward.

24:06.829 --> 24:11.098
I'm getting ready to hook
on to my raft here and
get headed down river.

24:11.767 --> 24:13.100
This is a big raft.

24:13.136 --> 24:15.803
This is bigger than
anything I've ever,
uh, done with my boat.

24:15.838 --> 24:19.807
So, hard to not be a little
bit nervous, and have some
anticipation when you're doing

24:19.842 --> 24:22.409
things on this river.

24:23.846 --> 24:27.882
<i> NARRATOR: Jessie has traveled</i>
<i> up river to retrieve his raft,</i>
<i> which will allow him to haul</i>

24:27.917 --> 24:30.484
<i> firewood for the</i>
<i> coming winter.</i>

24:30.520 --> 24:33.654
<i> But his success will</i>
<i> hinge on how the raft</i>
<i> can handle the load.</i>

24:34.157 --> 24:36.690
<i> And today, he'll</i>
<i> put it to the test.</i>

24:37.727 --> 24:40.327
JESSIE: This is it.
We're off. Maiden voyage.

24:43.766 --> 24:45.966
Onward we go.

24:46.002 --> 24:47.434
It's swinging good.

24:47.470 --> 24:49.003
Feel like I got good control.

24:49.038 --> 24:50.204
It's a big raft, though.

24:50.239 --> 24:52.740
My adrenaline's
definitely pumping.

24:55.645 --> 24:57.578
Feels good, like I
got plenty of power.

24:57.613 --> 25:02.349
I'm cruising at 2100 RPM's
and moving along nicely.

25:03.119 --> 25:05.753
You have to be on
guard when you're doing
something like this.

25:05.788 --> 25:10.624
You can't lose attention, and
I'm right above my spot here,

25:11.327 --> 25:13.194
need to land this
raft real good,

25:13.229 --> 25:15.663
and then I can, uh,
start skidding out some logs.

25:15.698 --> 25:17.665
I'm looking forward to
loading this raft up.

25:17.700 --> 25:19.767
It's gonna start
coming together fast.

25:19.802 --> 25:23.270
So I got my four-wheeler
here, and that's, uh, the
best way I've ever moved logs.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.673
Once I get back a little
further, there is just a

25:25.708 --> 25:28.409
motherlode of
firewood back there.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.880
Okay, looks like time to
get to work right away here.

25:52.168 --> 25:56.737
There it goes, right
there, it's goin' on
to those other trees.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.873
Whoa, wow.

26:02.778 --> 26:06.513
Tree number one down, think I
took down a few trees with it.

26:06.882 --> 26:10.918
I've seen a tree go up on a
tree like that and come back
shooting like a catapult.

26:11.587 --> 26:13.487
It's good.

26:13.522 --> 26:16.523
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
able to drag a log this big,
but I'm gonna give it a try

26:16.759 --> 26:18.993
and I'll find out real soon.

26:19.028 --> 26:21.729
You got 22 hours of daylight
here, may as well go hard.

26:21.764 --> 26:23.097
It's summer time.

26:23.132 --> 26:25.466
It's time to get things
done and getting ready
for winter right now.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.701
I can get a lot of
woods in the winter
with my snow machine.

26:27.737 --> 26:31.238
But my goal in the
winter is to be training
my dogs for the Iditarod.

26:31.707 --> 26:33.040
Things went well last year.

26:33.075 --> 26:34.708
I'm looking to
do better there.

26:34.744 --> 26:37.444
That's my main stay and
my main way of making
income right now,

26:37.480 --> 26:39.880
is to have a good
racing season.

26:39.915 --> 26:44.351
So, right now in the summer,
what I need to do is set
myself up to be able to put

26:44.387 --> 26:46.954
more time and more
energy into that.

26:46.989 --> 26:50.557
I might not get all
my firewood on this trip, but
If I get a large chunk of it,

26:50.593 --> 26:53.327
that puts me that far ahead.

26:54.230 --> 26:58.065
(chainsaw revving)

26:59.168 --> 27:03.270
(cracking)

27:04.907 --> 27:07.408
Nice.

27:08.844 --> 27:12.012
Working my way further back
in, getting some really
nice trees right now.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.548
I'm into the really
good stuff, and it's
adding up really quick

27:14.616 --> 27:16.850
out there at the landing.

27:17.186 --> 27:19.953
Got to push the envelope here,
bring a lot of wood back.

27:19.989 --> 27:22.990
I can't just push that
raft all back up here 20
miles and go do it again.

27:23.025 --> 27:25.025
So, this is a one-shot deal.

27:25.061 --> 27:28.128
I plan on loading it
up as big as possible.

27:37.273 --> 27:40.374
This is the biggest
log I've pulled yet,
hoping I can get it.

28:01.197 --> 28:04.031
How Rednecks roll, is hit
some more throttle to it.

28:05.301 --> 28:07.901
Go big or go Holmes.

28:11.507 --> 28:14.341
Long hard day, but I'm
feeling pretty invigorated.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.143
Getting a lot done.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.847
Gonna buy me some
time this winter.

28:20.082 --> 28:22.416
Do what I love.

28:26.021 --> 28:28.822
CHIP: People that lived in
this area right here before
us all relied on themselves.

28:29.225 --> 28:30.190
That's how life should be.

28:30.226 --> 28:31.925
You should rely on yourself.

28:42.438 --> 28:44.371
Oh, there's Shamoso.

28:44.740 --> 28:46.940
It looks like it's good to me.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.242
I think we got
here at low tide.

28:48.277 --> 28:49.777
It's a good tide.

28:50.579 --> 28:52.846
AGNES: Now, we just got to
get there before it gets dark.

28:52.882 --> 28:54.481
CHIP: Yup.

28:54.517 --> 28:57.418
Next challenge, darkness
and the river mouth.

28:58.504 --> 29:00.921
<i> NARRATOR: After purchasing</i>
<i> a new boat in Kotzebue,</i>

29:00.956 --> 29:03.924
<i> Chip and Agnes are</i>
<i> traveling back to</i>
<i> their camp in Kiwalik.</i>

29:04.326 --> 29:08.295
<i> But motor problems with the</i>
<i> vessel and a storm over head</i>
<i> force them to haul the new</i>

29:08.330 --> 29:10.497
<i> boat instead of</i>
<i> driving it back.</i>

29:10.933 --> 29:13.667
<i> And now, they're traveling</i>
<i> with a dangerously heavy load.</i>

29:14.970 --> 29:18.305
AGNES: I'm glad we left
Kotzebue when we did than
give up on the boat motor,

29:18.340 --> 29:19.873
and just throw it in.

29:19.909 --> 29:22.109
CHIP: Yeah. Well, we're
not there yet, dear.

29:22.144 --> 29:24.044
AGNES: I know, right?

29:24.480 --> 29:27.014
CHIP: Where the Shamoso
Islands are at the end
of shores peninsula,

29:27.049 --> 29:30.384
there is three different
currents that converge there,
and that's a dangerous place.

29:30.753 --> 29:32.820
But there's two times when
it's usually pretty mellow.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.955
One is high tide
and one is low tide.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.925
Unfortunately, low tide right
now is right before dark.

29:38.260 --> 29:40.727
So, it's kind of a
race towards dark
to get down there,

29:40.763 --> 29:43.964
then just drive around the
dark is a dangerous thing.

29:48.304 --> 29:50.204
AGNES: Well, we hit shallow.

29:50.239 --> 29:51.839
CHIP: Yup, we sure did.

29:51.874 --> 29:53.774
AGNES: I think if we
were, that's why you
slowed down, right?

29:53.809 --> 29:55.676
CHIP: That's why
I slowed down.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.511
This whole place is shallow.

29:57.546 --> 30:02.950
AGNES: We just about beat the
dark, but now we're trying to
figure out the sandbars here.

30:03.319 --> 30:07.521
And right as soon as we
figure out the sandbar here
and where exactly we are,

30:07.556 --> 30:10.624
because we're
almost to Kiwalik.

30:10.659 --> 30:14.595
Then we have like a mile
more to go to shore.

30:15.297 --> 30:16.597
Yeah? A mile?

30:16.632 --> 30:18.632
CHIP: I guess.
I have no (bleep) clue.

30:18.667 --> 30:22.336
Where the river meets the sea,
there is always sandbars out
from where the river would be,

30:22.404 --> 30:25.906
and at the very lowest
tides those sandbars are
all exposed, it got dark.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.542
And when it was
dark, we couldn't see
the sandbars anymore,

30:28.577 --> 30:30.511
and when you can't see the
sandbar to find the channel,

30:30.596 --> 30:32.412
sometimes you get
stuck on them.

30:32.448 --> 30:33.680
AGNES: You're not moving.

30:33.716 --> 30:35.148
CHIP: No, I'm not.

30:35.184 --> 30:37.584
AGNES: We just got
to try to get out of the
sandbar before the water,

30:37.603 --> 30:39.953
the tide goes lower.

30:39.989 --> 30:42.656
And then, we get stuck on
this sandbar overnight.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.826
This much look. Look.

30:46.962 --> 30:48.095
CHIP: Look at what?

30:48.130 --> 30:49.196
AGNES: This deep.

30:49.231 --> 30:51.298
CHIP: Okay.

30:51.333 --> 30:54.034
AGNES: The water is
still going down, and
we're still stuck.

30:54.303 --> 30:55.936
CHIP: Well, we might
be here for the night.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.141
AGNES: The water is going
down, and we're still stuck.

31:01.176 --> 31:02.643
CHIP: Yup, the water
is just getting lower.

31:02.678 --> 31:04.311
We're on our keel now.

31:04.346 --> 31:06.713
If the tide goes down another
six inches, we're gonna
be standing on dry ground.

31:06.749 --> 31:08.315
AGNES: Yeah.

31:08.317 --> 31:09.883
CHIP: So, let's throw out
the anchor, and that way,
when the tide comes up,

31:09.919 --> 31:12.319
we won't drift out to sea.

31:12.354 --> 31:15.455
If I get my sleep now
tonight, we got all day
tomorrow ahead of us.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.457
And we can just motor out.

31:17.493 --> 31:21.295
So, we'll call this the
hotel, and, uh, we'll get
some room service here.

31:21.897 --> 31:24.565
We'll just do things like
maybe take out the Kayak,
and take out the boat,

31:24.600 --> 31:27.200
we can make some
more room in here.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.937
What we basically
does is sitting up
on top of a sandbar.

31:30.005 --> 31:34.141
I know I'm not very far away
from the spit, and I'm, I'm
just gonna call it a night.

31:34.476 --> 31:35.509
Did you tie the rope to it?

31:35.544 --> 31:36.610
AGNES: Yup.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.211
CHIP: In the dark, you
don't take chances.

31:38.247 --> 31:40.614
Once you're in a safe
place, just stick it out.

31:40.716 --> 31:44.217
We've got darkness again,
and that's pretty cool
because we've had, you know,

31:44.253 --> 31:47.554
a 24-hour sunlight
for quite a long time.

31:47.656 --> 31:51.892
The very first, uh, the
very first real dark
is pretty interesting.

31:51.927 --> 31:53.961
Kind of catches
you by surprise.

31:53.996 --> 31:56.396
When the tide comes back
up, we'll get off the
sandbar and carry on.

31:56.432 --> 31:58.298
Nothing else that
we can really do.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.534
Tide and time wait for no man.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.139
RICKO: You survive by working
with the land, and that's

32:06.141 --> 32:08.742
all about native
culture right there.

32:20.923 --> 32:23.156
The net's been sitting for
a few hours just soaking.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.791
Hopefully, I got some fish.

32:24.827 --> 32:26.727
Hopefully, get a few to
put away for the winter.

32:26.762 --> 32:29.963
Maybe some for trapping
bait, and also something
to eat tonight.

32:31.266 --> 32:33.333
I'm gonna check this
bigger net first.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.202
I do see the floaters bobbing.

32:35.237 --> 32:38.438
So, hopefully that's not
a stick, and hopefully I
got some fish in there.

32:38.474 --> 32:41.208
Usually a good sign when
you see the floaters
bobbing like that.

32:41.644 --> 32:44.544
Pull it up from the bottom.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.914
I'm not seeing anything
here in the net.

32:49.952 --> 32:52.886
I do feel some weight.

32:53.455 --> 32:55.422
Oh, there's something in here.

32:55.457 --> 32:57.791
Oh, yeah, I got
some chum here.

32:57.826 --> 33:00.794
All right, I got some
nice-looking chum salmon here.

33:01.263 --> 33:03.797
These are good for bait.

33:03.832 --> 33:05.532
Oh, I got a nice fish here.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.234
This is a white fish.

33:07.269 --> 33:09.136
And these right here
are good eating fish.

33:09.171 --> 33:10.837
The stomach is
real good on them.

33:10.873 --> 33:13.507
Some people might think twice
about eating fish stomach.

33:13.542 --> 33:17.310
But us natives, we know
what we're doing out here,
and white fish is real good.

33:18.914 --> 33:21.381
Oh, what do we have here?

33:21.650 --> 33:23.550
This is a huge
pike right here.

33:23.585 --> 33:26.119
Oh. Monster.

33:26.555 --> 33:29.122
It's got some huge
teeth, huge mouth.

33:29.158 --> 33:32.359
It's basically like
the Alaskan alligator.

33:32.561 --> 33:34.995
Monster.

33:35.164 --> 33:37.197
I for sure see a few
meals out of this guy.

33:37.232 --> 33:38.799
He's big.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.601
I'm more than happy this
thing has done its job.

33:41.804 --> 33:44.204
I'm gonna eat good tonight.

33:45.407 --> 33:48.542
This is the last net
here, and, uh, this is
the one my late mom made.

33:48.644 --> 33:52.079
So, I'm hoping to
replicate the success
it's had in the past.

33:52.247 --> 33:56.550
It's over 30 years old, and,
oh, nice big pike right here.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.986
It's kind of cool to use this
old net my late mom made.

34:00.039 --> 34:03.106
Really brings me back because
she was a beautiful lady and

34:03.142 --> 34:05.675
she worked real hard
to keep us fed.

34:06.245 --> 34:09.046
This is the same slew
that I was raised up on.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.849
Eating from this water,
and I too am a parent now.

34:13.118 --> 34:15.602
So, I could only hope
that my kids can do this.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.905
Maybe use some of the
tools and the knowledge
that I taught them.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.894
So, for me to be able
to come back here, I'm sure
my mother, wherever she at,

34:23.929 --> 34:28.365
she's probably smiling down
on me, and maybe that's how
I have luck today, you know?

34:29.435 --> 34:31.902
Both nets did their job, I
was able to get a lot of fish.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.838
There's some I'm gonna eat
tonight, I'm gonna smoke
some in my smoke house,

34:34.873 --> 34:37.824
and I got some I'm gonna
put away, store it for
winter, trapping bait.

34:37.876 --> 34:40.644
So, it's a mission
accomplished today.

34:41.814 --> 34:44.181
I was able to get out
here, back to my roots,

34:44.216 --> 34:47.651
and use some of the old tools
my late mom had left me.

34:47.753 --> 34:51.121
Eating good like this
is like she proved
herself on this earth.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.893
JESSIE: Best to play
it safe when you're
out in the wilderness.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.329
For me, that's showing respect
to the land right there.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.631
Having a healthy fear of it.

35:09.341 --> 35:15.412
(chainsaw engine).

35:20.819 --> 35:22.619
I've got all the logs
down here I'm needing.

35:22.654 --> 35:26.423
So, hopefully, in a couple
hours, I'll be ready to break
camp and start heading down

35:26.458 --> 35:29.626
river with my, uh, payload.

35:30.863 --> 35:34.631
Time to roll up the
old sleeves and get
dog dirty on it.

35:36.835 --> 35:39.769
This is the most
wood I've ever gotten
myself in one load.

35:39.805 --> 35:43.306
This is a great
accomplishment for me to get
this much wood in one go.

35:43.342 --> 35:47.177
It's also really great because
I know that this is working
for me and this is something

35:47.212 --> 35:49.346
I can improve on every year.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.884
This raft is just
floating high for all
this weight that's on it.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.887
I was just trying to do twice
as good as I did last year,

35:56.922 --> 36:00.524
and it looks like I'm gonna
do five or six times better.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.168
Definitely gonna feel like
I did something today.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.004
Sleep's a lot better
when you earn it.

36:18.243 --> 36:21.711
This is a lot of hard work,
but this is the most fun
I've had all summer, I think.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.881
Doing things that are
adventurous, that I've
never done before.

36:24.917 --> 36:27.250
Trying things,
bettering things.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.736
It's probably when you see
your ideas come together
and it worked out good,

36:36.028 --> 36:37.494
it's a hell of a load.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.697
All right, getting down to
the last of the firewood here.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.465
Gonna try to load
the four-wheeler on.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.434
It's pretty sunk under there.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.136
Having never done
something this big.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.021
I don't really quite
know what to expect.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.639
The raft is starting
to sink down.

36:49.675 --> 36:52.776
It looks like both layers
of logs are under water now.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.078
The four-wheeler
weighs quite a bit.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.314
So, it's starting
to make me nervous.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.393
Looking pretty sketchy for
putting a four-wheeler on.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.683
JESSIE: Oh, it's floating.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.590
It's time to figure out
if it's gonna work or not.

37:44.229 --> 37:48.164
Yeah, just hope everything
moves along smoothly here.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.936
Looks like it's gonna work.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.572
Just have to make all the
right moves from here on out.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.242
The raft handling good.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.977
I feel like I
got good control.

38:01.013 --> 38:04.447
I'm just gonna take it nice
and slow, so I have plenty
of time to react to anything.

38:05.450 --> 38:10.120
Hard to not be nervous,
but I got, uh, 18 miles
of river to negotiate.

38:10.355 --> 38:15.859
So, it's all about reading the
water right now and staying
in the deepest channel.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.628
This is not a lazy river.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.864
This is a very
fast-moving river.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.365
And the raft's
handling good, though.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.435
I feel like I got control,
but I'm definitely still
apprehensive because

38:25.470 --> 38:27.303
it's a lot of weight.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.172
Oh, I go to stay clean
away from those cut banks.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.341
If I get too close, I can't
push out quick enough.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.544
So, I just really have to
make sure I make no mistakes.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.481
One mile at a time and
good decisions will
get me home with this.

38:45.557 --> 38:48.891
Always feel like a lucky man
to be out on the river, and
especially when I'm out here,

38:48.894 --> 38:52.896
getting a lot of
work done, and securing my
winter's worth of firewood.

38:54.833 --> 38:58.835
A couple grueling days
of hard work rewarded
by a beautiful sunset.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.906
You just can't beat the office
that I'm working in right now.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.375
This is a great job to have.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.383
AGNES: There is a lot
of dangers out here.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.351
It's not just me and
my children anymore.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.153
It's grandkids and everybody.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.522
So, we try to do
things the safe way.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.473
We're really starting
to rock, yeah?

39:36.508 --> 39:39.909
CHIP: We're starting to float.
That's why it's rocking.

39:43.682 --> 39:46.716
Oh, the sun's
gonna come up soon.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.586
CHIP: We are...

39:52.224 --> 39:55.959
CHIP: Oh, yeah, the channel's
over here about 500 yards.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.430
<i> NARRATOR: While traveling in</i>
<i> the darkness to Kiwalik, the</i>
<i> Hailstones got stuck on a</i>

40:00.465 --> 40:04.000
<i> sandbar, and were unable</i>
<i> to find deeper waters.</i>

40:04.369 --> 40:07.837
<i> They were forced to hunker</i>
<i> down until the return</i>
<i> of daylight and high tide.</i>

40:08.440 --> 40:11.641
<i> Today, they look</i>
<i> to find the channel to</i>
<i> guide them back to camp.</i>

40:13.178 --> 40:16.045
CHIP: Oh, yeah, we're floating
free with the tide up.

40:16.148 --> 40:19.349
And this tide coming up like
this will help us get right
to the mouth of the river.

40:20.585 --> 40:25.455
So, I think maybe it'll be
our best bet if we leave the
boats trailing behind us,

40:25.474 --> 40:27.524
and we just chug.

40:27.559 --> 40:30.059
You really don't have any
choice but to wait for
daylight and high tide.

40:30.228 --> 40:32.595
And we did it,
and that's what we had to
do, and we'd do it again,

40:32.647 --> 40:34.397
if we were ever in
that situation again.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.099
We waited it out,
the tied came.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.433
The boat got floating.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.736
We went boating.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.771
See, look, here's the
channel, 300 yards away.

40:41.807 --> 40:43.706
Maybe five.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.542
But you see in the
middle of the night.

40:45.577 --> 40:46.843
AGNES: It all looks the same.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.745
CHIP: There's no
getting over that stuff.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.181
With the high tide, we
can just drive right
across the lagoon,

40:51.216 --> 40:53.917
and find the mouth to the
river, and proceed up river.

40:54.019 --> 40:57.887
We're almost there, we got
another mile and a half to
go, and we will waddle up the

40:57.923 --> 41:00.456
river, and see what we can do.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.211
Oh, look. Woo.

41:05.430 --> 41:07.096
Now, there is a
bunch of ducks.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.098
It's a swarm.

41:09.734 --> 41:11.734
Oh, man, that's
a lot of ducks.

41:11.903 --> 41:14.737
That's probably
a good thousand birds,
couple thousand birds.

41:15.574 --> 41:19.209
AGNES: There's a whole
bunch of ducks welcoming
us back to Kiwalik.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.878
CHIP: Well, we'll be
eating birds then, wont we?

41:21.913 --> 41:24.981
AGNES: I was just
thinking, I guess that's
what's for dinner.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.051
CHIP: You know this place
is just full of wildlife.

41:28.086 --> 41:31.221
There's seals, there's birds,
there's caribou, there's
moose, there's musk ox,

41:31.256 --> 41:32.956
there's walrus.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.992
There's everything you could
possibly want going in and
out of the ocean, the lagoon,

41:36.027 --> 41:38.060
and into the river,
and off the tundra.

41:38.063 --> 41:41.848
So, having a small boat and
having a kayak is an excellent
way to access those things.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.800
Look ahead of us.
That's a big seal.

41:43.835 --> 41:44.868
AGNES: Ooh.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.302
CHIP: Oh, yeah, ugrukgaq.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.837
That's a good 400 pounder.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.539
Welcome home to Kiwalik, huh?

41:49.574 --> 41:51.007
AGNES: Yeah.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.309
CHIP: We leave for a
little bit, we come back,
and it's replenished.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.678
This is always an
excellent place to be.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.146
There is everything we want.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.982
It's the Kiwalik.
That's why we're here.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.783
AGNES: Yay.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.853
We made it, and
so did the boat.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.024
CHIP: Oh, here we go,
and now we're back in
the Kiwalik once again.

42:11.162 --> 42:15.164
SUE: To be here, you must be
brutally honest with yourself.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.134
Ask the important
questions, and be honest.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.314
All righty.

42:31.349 --> 42:36.819
Today, I'm gonna try to get
everything set and done, and
get my little buckets filled.

42:38.290 --> 42:43.326
One of the biggest elements is
the coal bricks that I made,
and I put it into these cans.

42:44.629 --> 42:47.397
But this can is also
gonna serve as a stove.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.534
This will burn
for quite a long time,
once you get it going.

42:58.176 --> 43:03.379
I got my coal bricks,
I have dry clothes,
bed roll, sleeping pad.

43:05.884 --> 43:08.418
You've got matches
and a lighter.

43:08.453 --> 43:11.921
Caribou jerky, willow and
stevia tea that I made.

43:12.958 --> 43:16.359
The barrel is designed
to sustain if you're careful,

43:16.661 --> 43:18.761
you're gonna sustain
life for a week or so.

43:18.797 --> 43:22.065
If you're gonna eat like a
porker, probably three days.

43:23.368 --> 43:26.703
You've got flares,
medical survival kit.

43:27.005 --> 43:29.973
You can't help an emergency
when it happens sometimes.

43:30.008 --> 43:32.709
It is a comfort to know that
these things are out there.

43:32.811 --> 43:35.311
Whether I need it or not,
the goal is never to use it.

43:35.347 --> 43:38.448
The goal is to be safe where
I'm at, and not be needing it.

43:38.550 --> 43:41.284
But if you do,
it's good to have.

43:48.827 --> 43:52.095
The first one from camp is
gonna be on top a sand hill.

43:52.197 --> 43:53.296
Why?

43:53.331 --> 43:54.931
It's the largest
thing that I can see.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.265
I know exactly where it is.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.900
I could find it in the dark.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.803
It's the tallest thing
out here going north.

44:04.042 --> 44:07.610
I think this is gonna
be my first barrel drop.

44:08.413 --> 44:14.517
Lone little bush here,
it's, uh, at the top of the
first hill, it's by itself,

44:14.552 --> 44:16.703
so it stands out.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.255
There's plenty of branch
work for me to flag.

44:19.290 --> 44:21.724
So I'm gonna see it.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.894
So let's unlock and unload.

44:25.897 --> 44:31.134
One of the other side thoughts
about why do I pick this
kind of a spot, the willow.

44:31.336 --> 44:34.604
Edible, I can make tea,
I can use the bark.

44:35.073 --> 44:38.174
So, I've got medicinal and
food qualities to this.

44:38.209 --> 44:41.344
I've also got sphagnum moss
down here, if I'm injured.

44:41.379 --> 44:44.380
It's antibacterial,
antimicrobial bandage.

44:44.883 --> 44:49.385
So, the place that
anyone picks for putting
their survival barrels,

44:49.421 --> 44:54.223
even the tree you attach
it to should have
some form and function.

44:54.893 --> 44:59.829
Most hunters, most
people that are out in the
woods, the wild, whatever.

45:00.432 --> 45:05.568
If you see a bush or a
tree, and there is tons
of flagging all over it,

45:05.937 --> 45:08.071
there's generally a reason.

45:08.106 --> 45:10.673
The goal is to catch
a person's attention.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.410
Anybody in need can
definitely use it.

45:15.980 --> 45:19.415
So it's not just me, although
that's my focus, is myself.

45:19.484 --> 45:22.685
What if I have my grandkid
here and there's trouble.

45:22.787 --> 45:25.388
He is gonna know where to
go, how to get himself saved.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.323
But it's open to the public.

45:27.358 --> 45:29.725
Safety can't be segregated.

45:29.761 --> 45:32.462
Safety can't be
something you sell.

45:32.497 --> 45:35.098
Safety has to be
available for everybody.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.500
So that's why I make it easy.

45:37.535 --> 45:40.369
Again, maybe it's my
lighthouse complex.

45:40.805 --> 45:45.775
It's a little beacon
for people to utilize
if they need it.

45:47.712 --> 45:51.247
That, you're gonna see
from a long ways away.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.418
Good job, Sue.
