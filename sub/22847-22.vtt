00:01.210 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.629 --> 00:06.424
That was the last time
anyone saw Daisy Johnson alive.

00:06.590 --> 00:08.676
- And then?
- 12.8 on the Richter scale

00:08.843 --> 00:10.511
<i>and the world cracked like an egg.</i>

00:10.720 --> 00:13.973
There's untapped deposits of gravitonium
under the Earth's surface.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.851
And you want to get it out
and power yourself up more?

00:17.309 --> 00:18.352
Coulson?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.187
He's not going to die,
not yet at least.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.732
<i>The Centipede Serum's the key
to curing Coulson.</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:24.608
What about Talbot?
You find a way to stop him?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.819
Yeah, we think so.
If we can combine the odium

00:26.986 --> 00:30.656
with another dose of the Centipede Serum,
it should be able to penetrate his cells.

00:30.823 --> 00:33.159
That's not possible.
There is no more Centipede Serum.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.078
- So, we either save Coulson...
- Or we save the world.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.598
<i>- He's out of time.
- There has to be another way.</i>

00:55.848 --> 00:58.434
<i>I'm telling you, the implant
only contains enough for one dose.</i>

00:58.517 --> 00:59.810
<i>Either it's medicine or a weapon.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:00.936
Davis said there's no change.

01:01.187 --> 01:04.190
<i>Why are we still discussing this?
The scale has tipped to one side.</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:06.525
<i>- This isn't numbers, it's Coulson.</i>
- You don't wanna be in there?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.527
<i>And Coulson didn't want this!
How many times</i>

01:08.736 --> 01:10.863
<i>- did he have to make that clear?</i>
- That's for them to decide.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.407
I know it's terrible.
I can't bear to see him like that.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.658
But this...

01:14.825 --> 01:17.328
- this is the moment.
- This is the exact circumstance

01:17.495 --> 01:19.121
- that she warned herself about.
- We're all aware.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.791
- We can change it right now.
- The odium mixture won't work

01:21.957 --> 01:23.626
if we can't penetrate Talbot's skin.

01:23.793 --> 01:25.586
Bullets can't get close to him,
no one could touch him,

01:25.669 --> 01:27.588
- not even you, Yo-Yo.
- There's no way to get the serum

01:27.713 --> 01:29.882
- in his body.
- What if he absorbs someone?

01:31.550 --> 01:34.428
Oh, don't look at me like that,
it... it's hypothetical.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.764
Exactly, all we have to do is have it
in the right hands

01:36.931 --> 01:40.017
- and that maniac will take the bait.
- So, who'd you have in mind, you?

01:40.476 --> 01:43.145
- I don't know, maybe.
- Now, you want to sacrifice yourself too?

01:43.312 --> 01:45.397
No, but I'm willing to. We all should be.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.358
- We know Coulson would.
- And if it doesn't work?

01:47.942 --> 01:50.736
- He would have died for nothing.
- Better than leaving this world in pieces!

01:50.903 --> 01:53.197
Robin said Coulson could put
the pieces together.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.741
She thinks that he's the key
to solving all of this.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.409
She speaks in broken riddles.
You're hearing

01:57.493 --> 01:59.078
- what you want to hear.
- What could Coulson do?

01:59.161 --> 02:02.665
He would never give up on Talbot.
And he wouldn't see him as a maniac,

02:02.832 --> 02:04.917
he would see him as a man,
as a broken man.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.795
Coulson's the only one that can talk him
through this, that's what he does.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.214
- Put him back together.
- I'm sorry, we save lives,

02:10.589 --> 02:11.924
I have to make this call.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.260
Fitz, Simmons, get ready to...

02:17.304 --> 02:19.932
- Yo-Yo?
- You're making me do this.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.894
- I can't let you use it for that.
- Put it down.

02:24.103 --> 02:28.691
- Okay, let's stay calm.
- Stop making me the bad guy. I'm not.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.527
- You just don't want him to die.
- Put it down.

02:31.735 --> 02:35.447
I don't want him to die either
but he's just one man.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.701
No. No. None of that.
Think about what you're doing here.

02:38.993 --> 02:44.123
You won't listen. I'm in a nightmare
and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs

02:44.290 --> 02:46.250
- and none of you can hear me.
- We hear you.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.461
But you won't listen!
You all saw what happened,

02:49.628 --> 02:51.881
and none of you will help me stop this.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.551
I'm alone and even you...

02:56.218 --> 02:58.637
- even you won't help me.
- No, you're not alone.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.307
We're in this with you
but we need to hold it together.

03:01.473 --> 03:05.269
- There's nothing holding us together!
- Yes, there is.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.272
Hope.

03:08.898 --> 03:09.940
We never give up.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.651
We're always held together by hope.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.614
So, we cling to it...

03:18.407 --> 03:19.450
and we vote.

03:23.746 --> 03:24.788
We vote.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.835
No.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.879
No, why?

03:32.838 --> 03:33.881
No.

03:37.468 --> 03:38.510
No.

03:46.769 --> 03:47.811
I'm sorry.

04:02.201 --> 04:04.161
Simmons and I will prepare the remedy.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.877
Everyone else should prepare
for the end of the world.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.351
Art project.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.813
It's time for you to point to the place
where you saw me surrounded

04:30.980 --> 04:33.983
by the liquid metal.
Just draw a little dot.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.777
If you get me close, I'll feel it now.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.284
You see this little guy?

04:43.993 --> 04:46.829
I'm the saviour
that's going to protect it...

04:47.788 --> 04:49.164
but I need some help.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.418
What do you say?

04:55.129 --> 04:57.506
Then I'll just take your damn
soothsayer powers!

04:57.756 --> 05:00.050
- Cut to the chase!
- No, you won't.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.348
Of course not.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.350
You're just a kid.

05:09.018 --> 05:10.978
But I will find a way to win you over.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.277
I'm here. You're doing good.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.612
Don't help him.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.701
But if I don't,
this will be the last time I see you.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.914
No! No! No!

05:31.081 --> 05:34.418
Robin! No! Let me go!

05:35.002 --> 05:36.045
That's true.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.214
You're not gonna see your mother again
until I get what I want.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.593
Now, let's try this again.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.731
Just one little dot.

06:07.493 --> 06:08.577
You're going to die.

06:11.914 --> 06:12.956
Well...

06:15.667 --> 06:16.752
everyone dies.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.006
And on that day,
we'll have to answer up there...

06:21.590 --> 06:23.092
for what we've done down here.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.017
It's not God I'm afraid of.

07:20.566 --> 07:21.775
I heard you were up.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.070
Up would imply the ability to stand.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.156
I'm not there yet.

07:28.615 --> 07:29.658
You will be.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.997
Um...

07:37.916 --> 07:39.251
I just want you to know...

07:40.294 --> 07:41.837
no matter what they say...

07:43.422 --> 07:45.507
I was never arguing for you to die.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.676
I just...

07:50.220 --> 07:53.348
I was just arguing
to not bet everything on you.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.642
And I would have taken your side.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.980
I know.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.198
Let's put one of those
in every room, if possible.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.741
It'll be useful, trust me.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.994
- Did you finish fuelling up the <i>Zephyr?</i>
- Yeah. And the Quinjet.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.829
We'll leave as soon as we get a location.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.624
I'm glad you're taking point
here at the Lighthouse.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.127
Who better than you to decide
what the next generation will look like.

08:22.294 --> 08:23.837
Get to show them
the ins and outs of this place.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.256
Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna be around
for all that.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.010
I'll call the mayor and give the tour,
but when you get back,

08:30.177 --> 08:31.970
- I think I'll be out of here.
- Why?

08:36.308 --> 08:37.476
This is my room.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.025
I'm like a squirrel,
hoarding anything I can find.

08:45.192 --> 08:49.071
Also, side note, found a nature book,
learned about squirrels.

08:49.321 --> 08:53.075
- Old habits die hard.
- It's more like I'm a damaged person.

08:54.326 --> 08:55.619
From a damaged world.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.372
If there's even a chance
that could happen again...

08:58.580 --> 09:00.040
You'd want to see the world
before it does.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.167
I mean, besides, according to Fitz,

09:02.376 --> 09:04.920
if the world doesn't crack open
and you break the time loop

09:05.087 --> 09:08.840
I'll just blink out of existence anyway.
So, it's just one more vacancy, right?

09:09.550 --> 09:12.386
Come on, I never totally fit in
with the gang anyway.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.054
Is that what we are?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.478
You know, when I first met you guys,
I'd never seen anything like that.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.398
I mean, I'd seen people kill
for each other without hesitation

09:24.565 --> 09:27.901
all the time, but I'd never seen a group
that was willing to die for each other.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.990
Your trust,
it just seemed too strong to break.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.953
And you trying to fix Coulson,
that's great, I love the guy, but...

09:38.537 --> 09:41.206
if you really wanna lead one day,
then you've gotta fix that.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.128
Just my two cents.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.131
I also read a book
on idiomatic expressions.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.383
- We're on the move.
- They spotted him?

09:51.592 --> 09:52.801
- Where is he?
- Chicago.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.567
That's not something
you see down at Urgent Care.

10:08.859 --> 10:11.653
It's almost the same serum
that was keeping Garrett alive,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.156
though the Centipede ingredients

10:14.364 --> 10:16.867
- might give you a little extra mojo.
- Jemma...

10:17.868 --> 10:20.245
you remember when I was carving
into the walls,

10:21.204 --> 10:23.123
and you know how it ended with Garrett.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.710
We've seen what happens
when we don't let nature take its course.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.920
Yes, sir.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.923
- And we discussed that as a group...
- Simmons.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.885
Will you give us a moment?

10:48.690 --> 10:50.692
I'm not going to detail
what we've risked to get this.

10:50.859 --> 10:51.902
I'm aware.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.363
And I'm not happy
I was left out of that decision.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.156
You wouldn't wake up.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.078
But now, the decision's yours.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.289
You're too weak to stand?
Well, we'd like to see you

11:04.456 --> 11:07.250
walk out of this room
and re-join the fight.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.674
But it's up to you,
if you think more time is worth it.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.471
I've made it clear how I feel.

11:20.806 --> 11:22.140
I think I have too.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.726
But even now...

11:26.019 --> 11:27.229
the word scares you.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.065
I'm just having a hard-enough time...

11:31.108 --> 11:32.484
leaving you behind.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.280
So, don't.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.741
We're ten minutes out.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.119
The buildings are holding for now
and the tracker we placed on Robin

13:06.286 --> 13:08.955
is back online
and it places her inside that ship.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.333
So, taking out Talbot is one thing,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.752
but we gotta clear the civilians
and rescue Robin too.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.545
Before the ship
and the buildings collapse.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.380
I would like to get close

13:17.547 --> 13:19.466
and test the building's
structural integrity.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.474
You asked to see me.

13:27.933 --> 13:28.975
Yeah.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.063
I'm aware that we rolled the dice
with Coulson.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.732
And I still believe that we need him
for this, but I will admit

13:36.024 --> 13:39.152
that I let my emotions get the best of me.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.281
I thought that Coulson
was the only one who could

13:43.532 --> 13:45.075
keep us all on the same page.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.871
You would say that's proof
that I can't do the job.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.790
That I shouldn't lead.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.296
Well, I agree.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.300
The truth is,
I can't hold the team together.

14:05.720 --> 14:06.763
But he can.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.101
Coulson wants me to call the shots
in his absence?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.772
Well, that's my decision,
Mack should call the shots.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.108
He has the biggest heart.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.069
I mean, physically, but also, you know...

14:22.362 --> 14:23.822
You are our moral centre.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.032
And look, I never want to stop...

14:26.992 --> 14:28.285
being a soldier.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.163
He is a general we can all rally behind.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.587
Anyone who thinks I'm 100 percent
right about this, raise your hand.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.513
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.808
- Thank God.
- Sir, good to see you.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.310
Hold the applause.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.229
She didn't go through that for nothing.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.942
Time to suit up.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.242
So...

15:09.618 --> 15:10.702
what do we do?

15:17.417 --> 15:18.460
We save lives.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.214
Block off that road!
Get down! Get down!

15:26.217 --> 15:27.802
This is Chicago PD.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.014
Hands above your head
or we will open fire!

15:31.264 --> 15:32.849
All that would be is noise.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.061
Right now, I want quiet.

15:38.021 --> 15:41.858
I can feel my future power
coursing through the ground below.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.489
I have a feeling
that isn't gonna do much.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.824
Yeah, it's feeling that way.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.372
Who is it?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.582
<i>Officers on the ground,
first responders,</i>

15:58.291 --> 16:01.920
<i>- this is S.H.I.E.L.D. We're here to help.</i>
- Oh, thank God.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.172
<i>We have an aircraft to evacuate
any civilians</i>

16:04.339 --> 16:05.715
<i>trapped near the centre of the city.</i>

16:08.635 --> 16:11.471
<i>You'll know it when you see it.
Get them there.</i>

16:16.851 --> 16:18.979
<i>We will clear the high floors
of the impacted buildings</i>

16:19.145 --> 16:20.397
<i>before they collapse.</i>

16:20.939 --> 16:24.150
<i>And most importantly,
do not engage the enemy.</i>

16:24.985 --> 16:27.696
<i>I repeat, do not engage the enemy.</i>

16:28.822 --> 16:29.990
<i>We will handle it.</i>

16:37.205 --> 16:40.000
I got you, I got you.
Right, come on.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.378
- Come on, come on, you okay?
- Yes.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.713
- Let's go.
- Yeah, go, go, go.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.048
- Come on, come on, all right.
- I'll give 'em some light

16:47.215 --> 16:49.509
so, we can make the stairwell.
Yeah, this way.

16:50.802 --> 16:51.845
Mum?

16:52.429 --> 16:53.471
Robin?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.857
It's okay, it's okay, Robin. You're okay.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.234
Mum... they took her away from me.

17:07.652 --> 17:08.903
They took her away.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.075
The hull of the ship is busted.
She must have climbed out.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.286
Your mother, Polly...

17:17.119 --> 17:18.413
is she in there?

17:20.623 --> 17:23.960
- Check the detention level. Bottom deck.
- All right, you stay with her.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.527
All right. I'll hit Talbot hard,
neutralise the threat,

17:49.694 --> 17:52.197
restrain him and you can walk right up
and do the talking.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.782
I'm not going.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.409
What?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.119
Why?

17:58.787 --> 18:01.206
Because I can barely stand.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.176
- You didn't take it.
- Didn't feel right.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.638
It didn't feel like the way
this was supposed to go.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.849
I'd have told you on the <i>Zephyr,</i>
but you'd have pinned me down

18:20.016 --> 18:21.893
and jammed that syringe
into my neck right there.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.103
Damn straight.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.023
I'm sorry.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.280
- You're the only one who can reach Talbot.
- That's not true.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.158
And I think we may be beyond that.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.829
If so, you're the only one
who can defeat him.

18:43.665 --> 18:47.001
Appeal to him as a military man.
He took an oath when he enlisted.

18:47.168 --> 18:50.004
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this. I can't.

18:50.380 --> 18:54.050
I can't do it. I can't go out there,
especially not alone.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.637
I've given you all the tools
you need to handle this.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.767
Now, you find the strength in your heart
to appeal to his good nature.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.479
And if you can't,
find the strength in your arms

19:06.938 --> 19:08.565
to beat his ass senseless.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.071
We're out of time.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.781
Go.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.046
You take it! Do you hear me?
You fly back, and you take it.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.967
We fought for you, okay?
We fought each other for you!

19:59.073 --> 20:00.116
Polly?

20:00.992 --> 20:02.035
Polly?

20:03.494 --> 20:04.537
Polly?

20:05.413 --> 20:06.456
<i>In here.</i>

20:22.013 --> 20:26.476
Robin.
Oh, good. Where's Mack?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.520
Uh... In the ship. He went to find Polly.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.278
May...

20:38.738 --> 20:40.573
neither of them make it.

20:46.621 --> 20:47.997
Oh, no.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.764
- Oh, thank God, you're here.
- You okay?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.266
Yeah. Robin?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.892
Don't worry.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.270
We have her.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.855
- Let's get you to her.
- Okay.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.732
- Stop! People are dying.
- This is war.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.775
Collateral damage is part of it.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.653
I need to arm myself,
so I can fight my enemies.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.699
You're becoming the enemy,
whether you believe it or not.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.082
- Run!
- There's nowhere to go.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.983
<i>Zephyr One</i>, Quinjet 323,
docking complete. We're on board.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.655
You want me to call for some assistance,
sir? You don't look too good...

22:45.782 --> 22:46.908
Oh, my God.

22:47.992 --> 22:52.205
- Coulson? Coulson? Coulson?
<i>- But it's not too late.</i>

22:52.580 --> 22:55.375
- Think about your son.
- I'm doing this for him.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.751
Did you see it in his face?

22:57.919 --> 23:01.047
- How scared he was.
- It's just because I seem different.

23:02.090 --> 23:06.344
I'm becoming the most powerful being
in the universe. He'll see it, one day.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.347
The end justifies the means, right?

23:11.349 --> 23:12.809
The only people who say that...

23:14.060 --> 23:15.728
are the people doing bad things.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.065
- I'm becoming a hero.
- You are one.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.162
The minute that you enlisted,
you became one.

23:33.538 --> 23:37.875
We all did. Look around,
you're surrounded by them.

23:39.752 --> 23:43.464
Anyone who signs up for this,
to lose friends, or limbs,

23:43.840 --> 23:46.634
or your mind, or your life...

23:47.552 --> 23:49.554
in protection of humanity.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.889
We're in this together.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.642
We need to join forces.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.271
That sounds good.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.109
You know, Hale gave me that speech,

24:03.693 --> 24:05.319
just before she tortured me.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.490
Coulson says it every time
he's gonna stab me in the back.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.034
Humanity is on the brink

24:12.660 --> 24:14.078
and I alone can fix it.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.877
But you're right...

24:22.503 --> 24:24.130
we should join forces.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.144
Mummy?

24:42.273 --> 24:43.316
Mummy.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.193
Come on, let's go.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.159
Now that Davis is back,
let's get ready to get up and out of here,

24:53.242 --> 24:55.411
- the <i>Zephyr</i> is filling up fast.
- Out of my way!

24:58.414 --> 24:59.499
He's not breathing.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.376
No, the serum should have worked,
I screened it for possible side effects.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.628
He didn't take it.

25:32.573 --> 25:33.616
Fitz!

25:35.576 --> 25:36.619
Fitz!

25:43.751 --> 25:45.002
Why did he listen to me?

25:48.589 --> 25:51.133
What have I done? Forgive me.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.526
I'll be able to get that buried treasure
a lot faster

26:08.734 --> 26:10.236
once I can quake the ground apart.

26:11.362 --> 26:13.030
Please...

26:19.537 --> 26:21.914
I'm gonna need every weapon
I can get in this fight.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.559
Something's different.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.237
It's gone! Yo-Yo, it's gone!
Get the defibrillator, now!

27:46.374 --> 27:49.752
Well, now I'll just break you in half.

28:13.109 --> 28:17.405
There you are, buddy. You had me worried.
We got you, just hang in there.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.093
We got you, buddy.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.515
I hope you saved some energy.
'Cause my leg's pinned,

28:44.682 --> 28:45.766
I think it's broken.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.935
You'll have to carry me.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.441
- All right, we got you.
- We got you, Turbo.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.235
Just...

28:59.196 --> 29:01.824
I think it's a bad break,
'cause I can't feel it.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.096
Relax, buddy, just breathe.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.098
- Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
- Just breathe.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.268
- Yeah, I'm gonna stay with you...
- Yeah.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.479
- Yeah.
- ...while we find a way out of this.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.941
Yeah, okay. Okay.

29:36.942 --> 29:40.529
Right, we should hurry up
and get Polly out, 'cause she's in danger.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.615
She's safe now.

29:44.158 --> 29:45.409
Yeah, you got her out.

29:46.285 --> 29:52.082
- You did good, Turbo. You did really good.
- Okay...

30:01.258 --> 30:02.301
Hey, Mack.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.143
I think my leg's broken.

30:14.063 --> 30:16.440
You've been... You've been through worse.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.186
Come on...

33:42.938 --> 33:45.190
this is a celebration, not a funeral.

34:01.331 --> 34:04.334
Remember how good it felt to walk in here
when we first got back?

34:05.919 --> 34:07.046
The <i>Zephyr</i> has...

34:08.005 --> 34:10.466
been the one place we've been able
to call home these last few years.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.926
- I'll always miss the Bus.
- Me too.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.344
I wish I would have known you guys
back then.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.639
We were different people back then.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.065
I spent a lot of years...

34:29.068 --> 34:30.110
Sorry.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.657
I've lived a life...

34:36.658 --> 34:37.951
surrounded by heroes.

34:40.370 --> 34:41.705
None bigger than all of you.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.460
Since the day you joined,
same as anyone in the line of duty.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.670
Heroes...

34:50.964 --> 34:52.007
because you...

34:55.552 --> 34:57.721
because we sign up to lose each other.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.852
To get close to good people...

35:04.812 --> 35:06.355
and have them taken away.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.734
We've all suffered losses.

35:12.194 --> 35:13.487
Never lose sight of that.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.493
- And never forget those we've lost.
- That's right.

35:20.494 --> 35:23.622
Yeah, that's why we're putting
that badge up in the cockpit.

35:24.748 --> 35:27.334
- To never forget.
- You don't have to forget...

35:29.002 --> 35:31.004
- but you have to move on.
- No.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.092
With respect, sir, you're wrong.

35:36.510 --> 35:37.761
We don't move on.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.682
We hold that place in our heart.

35:42.766 --> 35:45.102
We close it off
and we lock the door and we...

35:45.644 --> 35:47.062
visit from time to time,

35:47.855 --> 35:49.189
but we don't move on.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.984
Even after we say goodbye.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.656
I'm just sad I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to Fitz.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.416
But you'll tell him for me?

36:09.376 --> 36:10.544
Of course.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.882
I mean, he'll be sad
he missed this little memorial.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.300
Hey...

36:17.009 --> 36:18.844
- I'm not dead yet.
- Sorry.

36:19.553 --> 36:21.763
- Retirement party.
- I'm not sure this

36:22.055 --> 36:25.517
even qualifies as a party;
nobody's drinking yet.

36:34.193 --> 36:35.652
I want you to have this.

36:36.737 --> 36:39.364
A picture of our new home away from home.

36:41.158 --> 36:42.659
And to remind you that...

36:43.911 --> 36:47.831
your team always worked the problem,
no matter what the odds.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.170
And now he's frozen,
out in deep space somewhere,

36:53.503 --> 36:55.130
no idea he's already solved it.

36:56.632 --> 36:58.467
He'll be a little disoriented...

37:01.178 --> 37:04.932
but he'll be so happy to know
that time is not fixed.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.476
It's a fluid...

37:08.518 --> 37:10.687
ever-changing, beautiful thing.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.567
And he didn't miss much, did he?

37:17.361 --> 37:20.572
I have not a single doubt
you will find him.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.743
None of us do.

37:45.889 --> 37:46.932
All right.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.562
Here's to us.

37:55.232 --> 37:56.358
Who's like us?

37:57.693 --> 37:58.735
Damn few.

38:08.870 --> 38:09.955
Smooth.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.296
Thank you, boss.

38:28.265 --> 38:30.309
Probably gonna call you
every chance I can,

38:30.559 --> 38:31.643
for advice.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.478
You won't need it.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.939
And my phone is going in the ocean.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.544
How long did Simmons say you have?

38:58.211 --> 38:59.254
Days.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.089
Weeks, if I'm lucky.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.717
But it'll be time well spent.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.221
I left you something in your bunk.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.474
It's a letter.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.309
Nothing fancy.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.562
Basically, just says
how proud I am of you.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.611
I am so proud.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.954
- I love you.
- I love you too.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.383
And...

39:45.133 --> 39:46.760
- thanks for the spaceship.
- Yeah.

39:47.594 --> 39:48.804
Don't mention it.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.729
Gotta say...

41:21.938 --> 41:23.148
it's pretty magical.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.651
Hmm.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.406
So...

41:32.532 --> 41:34.493
anything else on your bucket list?

41:37.078 --> 41:38.246
Just one thing.

41:40.457 --> 41:43.084
- Parasailing?
- Yeah, parasailing.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.879
Always wanted to try that.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.636
All right, Director...

41:54.095 --> 41:55.222
where to first?
