<i>Question number two.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:43.689
<i>Describe a challenge, hardship or a
misfortune you have experienced in your life.</i>

00:43.760 --> 00:45.683
<i>What have you
learned from this...</i>

00:45.760 --> 00:48.411
<i>and how has it prepared you
for the future?</i>

01:00.200 --> 01:03.204
<i>Dear Dean of Admissions,
my name is Sutter Keely...</i>

01:03.280 --> 01:07.808
<i>and up until yesterday I had the
best fucking girlfriend in the world.</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:11.527
<i>Hmm- I know I probably shouldn't
say "fuck" right there, but I'm sorry.</i>

01:11.600 --> 01:13.250
<i>I have to.</i>

01:13.320 --> 01:16.051
<i>Like, we had this connection.
Seriously.</i>

01:16.120 --> 01:18.361
Everybody knew us.
Everybody loved us.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.046
We were a force to be reckoned with.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.090
<i>I'm not gonna say that we were
the life of every party, but we were.</i>

01:24.960 --> 01:27.327
<i>We were the life of every party</i>

01:28.640 --> 01:31.644
<i>Before Cassidy,
I wasn't much of a relationship guy.</i>

01:31.760 --> 01:34.480
<i>But once we started hooking
up, that all changed.</i>

01:34.506 --> 01:35.756
<i>I'm fucking horny.</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:38.485
I liked her.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.562
<i>A lot.</i>

01:42.120 --> 01:45.044
<i>Everything was going great in my world.
I don't know what happened</i>

01:45.120 --> 01:48.920
<i>I was just trying to get my best friend
Ricky some much-needed sexual attention.</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:51.924
Oh, okay, Colleen Marshall.
She's nice.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.083
She's way too tall.
I'd look like her son.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.083
Man, I'm tired of your excuses.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.970
Tonight- Tonight's the night.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.530
What night is this?

02:01.640 --> 02:04.610
Tonight's the night
I'm gonna get you some action, Ricky.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.364
Yeah.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.925
Oh, yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.321
Get some sweet, sweet action.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.122
I don't know about this, Sutter.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.567
Why? They're just girls, man.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.210
Relax. it's fine.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.045
What is that?

02:21.160 --> 02:23.162
Ah, it looks like potential.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.443
Just the man we were looking for.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.443
What's up, Tara, Bethany?
Hey, girls.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.444
- Know where we can score some beers?
- Uh, yeah.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.000
- I think I can help you out with that.
- Okay. Let's do it!

02:34.080 --> 02:35.605
- Let's do it!
- Oww!

02:35.680 --> 02:37.364
Potential, man. it's potential.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.721
- My hero!
- That's what I do.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.724
Uh, Bethany, you know
my friend Ricky, don't you?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.876
Aw, shit, dude. I forgot
my cell phone in the car.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.924
No, you guys go ahead.
We'll get the next one.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.128
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.407
- That was bullshit about the phone?
- Totally.

02:57.480 --> 03:01.087
I can't wait to get out of this place.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.562
Can we put on something else, maybe?

03:04.640 --> 03:06.563
Hmm? You don't like this?

03:06.640 --> 03:09.246
I love this. It relaxes me.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.243
Gotta listen to the lyrics too.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.970
- Who's this?
- Oh.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.442
<i>It was harmless.
I was just there helping out a friend.</i>

03:16.520 --> 03:18.124
<i>- Is there something wrong with that?</i>
- Hey.

03:18.200 --> 03:21.329
<i>But next thing I know, I'm being accused
of crossing a line or something.</i>

03:21.440 --> 03:23.344
<i>- I mean, seriously, it was a
complete misunderstanding.</i>

03:23.370 --> 03:24.071
<i>Who is this chick?</i>

03:24.120 --> 03:26.088
<i>I still can't make sense of it.</i>

03:26.160 --> 03:28.228
- This is for Ricky. I
put him in a canoe with-

03:28.254 --> 03:29.632
You are a lost cause, Sutter!

03:29.680 --> 03:32.729
- Cassidy, you can't be serious right now.
- We are done! We're done!

03:32.800 --> 03:35.929
<i>To he honest, though,
I wasn't that worried.</i>

03:36.000 --> 03:39.368
<i>We'd had our ups and downs, sure.
But what great couple doesn't?</i>

03:40.840 --> 03:42.604
I'm sorry.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.921
<i>All I had to do was calm her down,
explain the situation...</i>

03:50.040 --> 03:54.170
<i>tell her how important she was to me,
how good we were together...</i>

03:54.240 --> 03:56.368
<i>and how much our relationship meant.</i>

03:56.440 --> 03:58.442
Sutter, what are you doing here?

03:58.520 --> 04:02.889
Cassidy, that is a really pretty
dress that you're wearing right now.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.725
That's goddamn stunning, that dress.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.326
- That dress- Wow.
- Thank you.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.006
- Is he drunk or something?
- Probably.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.448
Well, let's just say if "drunk" equals
"A" and something else equals

04:14.520 --> 04:16.442
the answer is definitely not

04:16.519 --> 04:18.761
- Sutter-
- Look, man, I know this is awkward.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.446
- Maybe we should-
- No, it's really not awkward at all.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.921
Marcus West talking to me.
What an honor, man.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.445
- Hey, man-
- What an honor!

04:25.520 --> 04:27.045
Sutter!

04:27.160 --> 04:30.403
I completely understand the meaning
of the phrase "kicked to the curb"...

04:30.480 --> 04:32.721
so I will bid you both
a pleasant evening.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.167
- Sutter, what happened here-
- Just let him go.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.765
He drives better this way.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.769
Thank you for that vote of confidence,
beautiful.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.804
You are a very understanding woman
in everything but love.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.722
<i>Arrivederci.</i>
Fuck you.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.884
<i>You want hardship,
misfortune? Well, there you go.</i>

04:50.960 --> 04:55.807
<i>Will I wallow in my misery? No, I won't,
Dean of Admissions. Not Sutter Keely.</i>

04:55.880 --> 04:58.804
<i>And in the meantime, why should
she be the only one having fun?</i>

04:58.880 --> 05:01.804
<i>It's a beautiful night outside,
and I am just getting started</i>

05:01.880 --> 05:03.803
- I need to see your I.D.
- What's up, man?

05:03.880 --> 05:05.097
Need to see your I.D., bro.

05:05.123 --> 05:07.512
Oh, dude, like, I had
it, and then I forgot it-

05:07.560 --> 05:09.711
I think I left it in there,
maybe in the bathroom.

05:09.737 --> 05:10.748
I'm sorry, brother.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.724
- Hey, I know the manager.
- No I.D., you can't get in, man.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.486
John? Big Joh- The little one?
The manager? Big John.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.329
Yo. What's up, ladies?

05:23.400 --> 05:26.324
So, I'm 18 and I just got
dumped by my girlfriend...

05:26.400 --> 05:27.925
and I need a drink.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.207
So, would somebody- like, anybody...

05:30.280 --> 05:31.964
please have a drink with me?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.804
Whoo!

05:33.880 --> 05:35.644
Red shit!

05:35.720 --> 05:37.085
Ahh.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.886
What do you mean-
Whoa, hey. Wait.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.203
I thought we were all
hanging out after this.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.362
Come on! Please! Please!

05:52.440 --> 05:54.807
I don't wanna...
I'm not gonna beg you.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.087
I will beg you. God!

05:59.280 --> 06:01.123
Bye.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.885
Hey! You're beautiful!

06:03.960 --> 06:06.884
You're holy! Down with the king!

06:06.960 --> 06:10.407
Down with the motherfucking king!
Whoo!

06:19.440 --> 06:21.124
Hello?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.210
Hey.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.204
Hey.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.770
Hello?

06:31.760 --> 06:34.969
Hey. Hello? Hi.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.684
Hi.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.364
Hi.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.442
Oh, my God. You're alive.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.490
I thought for a second
that maybe you were dead.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.602
I don't think I'm dead.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.484
Where the hell am I?

06:50.560 --> 06:53.803
Um, you're in the middle of a... yard.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.723
Do you know who lives here?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.290
No.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.362
Jesus, I must've fallen asleep.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.203
Here. Let me help you up.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.806
Where the hell's my car?

07:09.880 --> 07:11.484
I don't know.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.482
Do you live around here,
Sutter?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.289
How do you know my name?

07:18.360 --> 07:21.409
We go to the same school.
You wouldn't know who I am.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.608
No, I know you.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.523
You're, uh-

07:26.720 --> 07:28.245
Uh-

07:28.320 --> 07:30.561
I'm Aimee. Aimee Finecky.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.718
That's what I was gonna say.
Nice to meet you, Aimee.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.589
Nice to meet you.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.603
What time is it, Aimee?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.682
Uh, it's, like, 6:00 a.m.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.162
Are you just getting back
from a party or something?

07:42.240 --> 07:45.687
No, no, I'm just, uh, on my paper route.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.525
It's not really mine.
It's my mom's. But...

07:48.600 --> 07:52.525
she was out with my stepdad last
night at a casino, so, um-

07:52.600 --> 07:54.932
- They didn't get back
till late, so I just-

07:54.958 --> 07:55.993
Do you need help?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.610
- With my route?
- Yeah.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.763
- No, no, no. I'm okay. Thank you though.
- I can help you.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.171
I'm good.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.765
Thank you.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.969
Aimee, you know, you're gonna
drive around the neighborhood...

08:07.040 --> 08:09.611
and I don't know where my car is.

08:09.680 --> 08:12.889
So I think that we can
help each other out.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.043
What do you say?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.483
Try aiming ahead of the driveway.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.971
Okay.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.361
Didn't realize newspaper throwing
was such a big business.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.330
- Must make a lot of money.
- Yeah. I mean, my mom does.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.640
- You get nothing?
- No, I get a little.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.291
Most of it goes toward
paying the bills though, so-

08:35.360 --> 08:38.068
That doesn't sound fair. You
do all the work, don't you?

08:38.094 --> 08:39.470
Some of it- Most of it.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.091
She's your mom.
She should be paying all your bills.

08:42.780 --> 08:45.155
I'm serious.
That doesn't sound fair to me.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.806
I think you're getting the raw end
of this newspaper-throwing deal.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.526
- It's fine.
- Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.523
Should have seen me
back in the day.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.524
- When I was in Little League, I
had a pretty good arm. - Yeah?

08:55.600 --> 08:59.605
Yeah. My dad said I could have
went pro if I'd stuck with it.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.284
Yeah!

09:01.360 --> 09:03.647
Dude, you're a natural.
Good job.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.810
Whoo!

09:09.160 --> 09:11.242
Oh, shit. Hey, I hit a dog.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.681
What?
- I'm serious.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.445
- Sutter!
- It's still walking.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.290
Whoa! Went way downtown!

09:23.080 --> 09:24.650
You know, Aimee Finecky...

09:24.720 --> 09:27.530
I was having a really rotten night
last night until you came along.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.046
I think that we should
get lunch sometime.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.610
Okay.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.809
- How about Monday?
- Okay. Monday it is.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.329
You're up early.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.721
- Yup.
- Mmm.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.804
They have me on a double shift.
Again.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.329
Oh, damn it, Sutter.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.566
Didn't I ask you to hang this for me?

09:56.640 --> 09:59.007
Look. Look how
wrinkled this is.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.445
Would've taken you two seconds to hang
this up for me. Is that too much to ask?

10:05.520 --> 10:07.443
I forgot. I'm sorry.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.852
It's not like you do
so much around here.

10:09.878 --> 10:11.709
Hey, I do a lot around here.

10:11.760 --> 10:16.243
Oh, I'm sorry. I hate to interrupt
your Cheerio... eating.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.402
I'm sorry, Mom.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.921
Sometimes you remind me
so much of your dad.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.444
All right, there's
leftovers in the fridge.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.443
I won't be home for dinner.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.761
Or you can call your sister.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.842
- And, Sutter?
- Mm-hmm?

10:41.560 --> 10:45.042
Next time I ask you
to do something-

10:46.680 --> 10:49.286
I love you so much it hurts.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.443
- It hurts me how much I love you.
- You know what's gonna really hurt?

10:52.520 --> 10:55.444
Who knew dinner and a movie
would cost 30 bucks?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.966
Pretty much anybody
who's ever been on a date.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.441
But the best part is, dude,
she didn't care.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.807
She paid for popcorn and everything.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.450
She's just-

11:05.760 --> 11:08.604
- What?
- Uh-

11:08.680 --> 11:10.648
- Did you kiss her?
- Check.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.644
- Yeah. Did you get a little tongue action?
- Double-check.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.166
- Nice.
- Thanks, man.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.164
So what do you want to eat
for lunch, man? I'm starving.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.681
Aren't you eating with what's-her-name?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.331
Aw, shit. Yeah.
I forgot.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.323
You know,
I gotta tell you, Sutter.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.050
Aimee Finecky?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.487
It's just a strange choice for a rebound.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.483
Dude, she's not a rebound.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.007
She's not. Do I look like I have
any interest in dating Aimee Finecky?

11:37.640 --> 11:39.529
I think she's a nice girl, man...

11:39.600 --> 11:41.523
whose mom makes her
deliver newspapers...

11:41.600 --> 11:44.524
5:00 in the morning,
six days a week, pays half the bills.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.130
Aimee doesn't say shit about it.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.044
- That sucks.
- Well, it's bullshit is what it is.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.521
All right, so where do you come in?

11:51.600 --> 11:54.524
Um, I mean,
I think I can help her out.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.161
So, if two planes intersect,
they intersect in exactly-

11:58.240 --> 12:02.131
Give it to me- one plane.
One point. one line.

12:03.242 --> 12:05.986
- Oh, that's lunch, you
lucky sons of guns.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.644
Don't forget to do the homework.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.290
Sutter.
A word, please.

12:09.360 --> 12:09.890
Huh?

12:09.916 --> 12:12.036
Mr. Keely, sit down.
I have to have a word.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.481
- I have somewhere to go.
- Good-bye. Good-bye, Hannah.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.483
Don't be late tomorrow, please.
Thank you.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.164
You, button up.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.083
- What's up?
- What's up?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.561
I noticed you didn't turn
in your homework.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.689
That's funny, man,
'cause, honestly, I did it last night.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.683
And I- All the- I filled it out-

12:27.760 --> 12:30.161
- Do me a favor. Stop talking.
- All right.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.730
- What's up?
- You tell me.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.690
Sutter, I only want to see you succeed.
You know that. Right?

12:34.760 --> 12:37.684
- I know. I know.
- If you fail, that means I fail.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.684
I like my job. I like you.
I don't want to fail.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.764
I don't want you to fail either.
That's why I'm not gonna let us fail.

12:43.840 --> 12:46.245
I'm gonna get it together.
I'm turning that corner.

12:46.271 --> 12:47.426
Make me believe you.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.801
- I want to believe you.
- I'm feeling smarter already.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.326
All right.
Let me see you answer this.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.802
If one acute angle
is two times larger than the other...

12:55.920 --> 12:58.400
what's the measure of the two angles?

12:59.760 --> 13:01.683
- That's what I thought.
- That wasn't on the homework!

13:01.800 --> 13:03.723
That was the homework! Stay right there!

13:03.800 --> 13:07.122
We're gonna do it together. We're
gonna do homework together. I love it.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.649
Hey.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.247
That's crazy.
How fast were you going?

13:30.320 --> 13:32.687
Like 20, 25 miles
an hour or something.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.888
- And you just jumped out of the car?
- Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:35.934
What?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.996
- It was snowing, so I
didn't think it would hurt.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.690
But it did.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.570
That's amazing.
That's awesome.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.529
You're such a good listener.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.400
No, I-

13:47.480 --> 13:50.086
Um, all right.
You go.

13:50.160 --> 13:54.370
Um, I remember, um-
I think it was sophomore year.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.125
You came to gym class
and you were wearing the mascot head.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.725
You refused to take it off.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.086
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.764
Yeah, that was funny.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.649
It was really funny.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.644
Yeah. No, I mean, like,
what's a story about <i>you?</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:09.041
- About me?
- Yeah.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.563
Um... I don't really
have any stories.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.644
What do you mean?
Everyone's got a story.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.848
Not me, I guess.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.726
Um, all right. So, what's- I don't know.
What's your thing?

14:24.560 --> 14:26.050
- My thing?
- Yeah.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.122
You know.
Everybody's got a thing.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.248
Larry Rourke? Stoner.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.164
Greg Jacoby is the rich kid.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.288
What's- What's your thing?

14:35.360 --> 14:36.138
I don't know.

14:36.164 --> 14:39.276
I-I'd like to think that there's more
to a person than just one thing.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.322
You know?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.170
- Yeah.
-  Hello, Aimee.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.686
So, he finally got here, did he?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.001
- This is Kristal.
- Hey, Kristal. Sutter Keely.

14:49.080 --> 14:52.527
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.080
Uh, Aimee, come on.
French Club.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.730
They're waiting for us.
Chop-chop.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.327
I'm so sorry. Oh, my God,
I totally forgot about French Club.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.323
No, it's all good.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.802
Um, hey, did you have Mr. Aster
for geometry class?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.609
Yeah, freshman year.

15:07.680 --> 15:10.251
Probably thought it
was pretty easy.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.448
Kind of.
I don't know.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.204
Yeah?
I'll bet you did.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.965
Uh, would you mind, like, tutoring me?

15:17.040 --> 15:20.328
He's talking all the time.
I have no idea what he's saying.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.044
Yeah, sure. Totally.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.566
Um, yeah. Just, uh-

15:24.640 --> 15:28.804
You can just, like, call me and- Yeah.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.801
Just call me.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.404
Awesome.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.090
It was nice meeting you too.
It was a pleasure.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.730
See you later.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.450
All right. Bye.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.086
- You have great taste in bow ties.
- Thank you.

15:49.160 --> 15:52.164
That was my favorite.
I would have bought it if you didn't.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.762
See you at home.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.683
Bye-bye.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.443
- Hey
- Hmm?

16:11.520 --> 16:14.000
- What do you think of that?
- You're getting better.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.339
That's really good. That's
the best I've seen yet.

16:16.365 --> 16:17.029
All right.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.726
- When are you gonna adopt me?
 I'm sorry.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.646
- Two's my limit on mouths to feed.
- Okay. Offer's still there.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.087
- What were we talking about?
- Um, Cassidy.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.003
- Ah.
- Yeah.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.321
I liked her.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.323
Yeah. Me too.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.483
Kinda thought she'd be the one
to yank you out of neutral.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.484
Neutral? What are you talking about?
Dan, I'm in overdrive.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.125
What?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.250
Aimee!

16:56.320 --> 16:57.970
Shane, shut up!

17:02.800 --> 17:04.450
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.010
- How are you?
- I'm good.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.890
- Good. Come on in.
- All right.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.364
Hey.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.090
- This is my brother Shane.
- Hey, Shane.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.443
- He just learned that.
- Charming.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.041
- Yeah. We can study in my room.
- Lead the way.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.010
Wow.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.367
This is- This is really nice.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.010
Thank you.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.209
I try to keep it clean.
There's a lot of stuff everywhere.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.931
- You read a lot? You like books?
- I do, actually.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.530
I love books.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.809
They're mostly just science fiction.
A few mysteries.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.843
And other things.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.287
- That one is really weird.
- This is the weird one?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.806
- You picked a really weird one.
- Weird is good.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.803
I say, embrace the weird.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.689
It's really weird.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.205
Is this backwards?

18:01.280 --> 18:04.204
Yeah. it's just the way
that you read them.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.329
See, you start...
back here...

18:07.440 --> 18:09.204
at the beginning.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.964
- Yeah.
- Cool.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.569
<i>- Gleaming Planet. Gleaming Planet.
- Planet.</i>

18:15.640 --> 18:17.642
Is this-

18:17.720 --> 18:19.643
Is that you flying through space?

18:19.720 --> 18:23.088
No. No. She's just a character
from those books that I like.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.004
- Really stupid.
- No, if you like it, it's not stupid.

18:26.080 --> 18:28.287
Yeah, well-

18:28.360 --> 18:30.442
What makes her so special?

18:30.520 --> 18:34.525
Um, she's in charge of this thing
called the Neexo Ark.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.730
And it's up to her
to escape the Dark Galaxy...

18:38.800 --> 18:41.087
and save the Gleaming Planet star system.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.242
- ♪ Ba-ba-bah ♪
- ♪ Ba-ba-bah ♪

18:43.320 --> 18:44.890
Yeah.

18:44.960 --> 18:48.681
I don't know. Like, I know it's
odd and... stuff, but...

18:48.760 --> 18:50.762
she's actually...

18:50.840 --> 18:52.569
really awesome.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.244
She's kinda my hero.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.285
Well, you will be my hero if you can
help me out with this geometry business.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.328
I have no idea...

19:00.400 --> 19:01.890
what I'm doing.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.450
Is this the right book?

19:03.520 --> 19:05.124
Yes.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.044
How much of it have you studied?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.168
"Studied." That's a strong word.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.204
Angle "C" and angle

19:14.280 --> 19:16.089
are complementary-

19:16.160 --> 19:18.766
Complementary. Got it. Got it.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.764
Man, you're a wonderful
teacher, Ms. Finecky.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.968
- So you understand it?
- Yeah.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.451
Okay.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.450
What I don't understand
is why I need to know this stuff.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.801
Seriously, like, who, like, calc-

19:30.880 --> 19:32.803
Coplanar lines and angles-

19:32.880 --> 19:35.804
Who calculates
slopes at a job?

19:35.880 --> 19:37.530
Aimee?
- Who needs this shit?

19:37.600 --> 19:40.331
Come on out here right now,
will ya.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.971
Thought you was
gonna get us some milk.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.408
- I will.
- Do it now, for Christ's sake!

19:47.560 --> 19:49.244
I am so sorry.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.731
It's okay.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.087
- I should probably-
- Yeah, um-

19:53.160 --> 19:55.970
Hey, there's a party
on Saturday...

19:56.040 --> 19:58.805
and I think that you
should go with me.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.325
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.323
- What?
- Yeah, I'll come by and pick you up.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.164
How's that sound?

20:04.240 --> 20:07.164
Um... okay?

20:07.240 --> 20:10.323
- Is that an answer or a question?
- No, no. it's an answer.

20:10.400 --> 20:13.324
- If you don't want to go-
- No, I do, I do. I-

20:13.440 --> 20:15.090
I would like that.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.764
Thank you.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.002
- Do you want me to carry that?
- I got it.

21:33.080 --> 21:36.448
You good? All right.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.883
- See the water?
- Yeah.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.883
- Do not go in there.
- No?

21:54.000 --> 21:56.844
Too disgusting. No.
I think people poop in there. Here.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.322
I'm good. I don't
really drink.

21:58.348 --> 22:00.950
Just hold it. It gives off the
illusion you're having fun.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.401
You don't have to drink it.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.451
Hey, what's up, guys?
How you doing?

22:07.520 --> 22:11.002
This is, uh, Aimee Finecky.
I don't know if you guys know her.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.481
Hey, Cody, you're a reader,
aren't you?

22:13.600 --> 22:16.021
Have you read those
<i>Gleaming Planet</i> books?

22:16.047 --> 22:16.947
One or two.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.207
I forgot to tell you,
I started reading one last night.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.726
- You did?
- Yeah. It was really cool.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.802
- Which one?
- The one where Shirei Migoto...

22:23.880 --> 22:27.646
uh, fights that cosmic superlord
and just starts fucking him up.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.200
- I know! Right? She's awesome.
- She is awesome.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.204
I love those books.
Have you read <i>Solar Bolt?</i>

22:33.280 --> 22:35.328
Yeah.
Solar Bolt is great.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.449
There's so many awesome,
rad parts between-

22:38.520 --> 22:42.047
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.
I don't think we've met.

22:42.120 --> 22:44.327
I'm Sutter Keely.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.324
- I'm Cassidy.
- How's it going? That's a nice handshake.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.324
- Thank you.
- Um, do you want to go get a beer with me?

22:50.400 --> 22:52.323
I'm having a
conversation right now.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.846
She'll be here. You'll be here, right?
We'll come back.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.611
We're just gonna grab a beer.
Come on. Come on.

22:56.637 --> 22:57.516
You're unbelievable.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.562
- I will be back.
- Please. Thank you.

23:00.560 --> 23:02.483
Don't smile at me like that.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.211
I can't help myself.
You know that I can't help myself.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.322
Sutter. Please.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.803
Maybe just- Yeah, that's good.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.689
- Cassidy. Hey.
- Hey!

23:14.760 --> 23:16.762
- Sutter.
- Marcus.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.765
- I gotta get going. You riding with me?
- Yeah.

23:22.880 --> 23:24.450
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.280
- It was good to see you.
- Next time.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.248
Just a flick of the wrist.
It's done in half the time.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.969
Hey. What's up, man?

23:54.040 --> 23:55.565
- What's up, Sutter?
- Everything cool?

23:55.640 --> 23:57.483
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.803
I was gonna go for a walk.
You wanna come with me?

24:00.880 --> 24:03.531
- Yeah. I would love to.
- All right. Cool.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.090
- All right.
- Cheers.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.164
- Nice to meet you.
- It was good to meet you.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.313
Hey, I'm sorry if that
guy was bugging you.

24:15.339 --> 24:16.268
No, he's fine.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.243
- Totally fine.
- Yeah? Okay.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.322
Are you done?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.923
- Ooh. Can I try that?
- What, this?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.924
- This is some pretty serious stuff.
- Just a taste.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.844
- Are you sure? All right. Here you go.
- Yeah.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.843
Go for it.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.287
It's pretty strong.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.124
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.009
- Ew.
- Yeah, I know.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.884
- Whoa!
- I know! I told you.

24:39.960 --> 24:40.985
How do you drink that?

24:41.011 --> 24:43.990
I don't know. I guess I've just
been doing it for a while.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.963
I don't know.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.441
- You know who gave me my first beer?
- Who?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.045
- My dad.
- Really?

24:50.120 --> 24:52.521
Yeah. I was probably
six years old.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.047
Used to take me to baseball games every
Saturday and let me have little sips.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.202
- Did you get drunk?
- No.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.648
But, I mean, it tasted really nice.
It felt warm.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.763
Where is he now, your dad?

25:04.840 --> 25:06.569
- He's an airline pilot.
- Really?

25:06.640 --> 25:09.564
- Yeah, he flies all across the country.
- Sutter, that's awesome.

25:09.640 --> 25:14.123
He is awesome. I don't know what he
was doing with my mom for that long, but-

25:14.240 --> 25:15.924
Are they, like, divorced?

25:16.000 --> 25:19.004
Yeah. She made him leave us
a long time ago.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.610
- You want some more?
- Sure.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.364
Try it? Yeah?
Why not?

25:23.440 --> 25:27.365
- Kinda sounds like we have the same mom.
- Yeah? How so?

25:27.440 --> 25:29.363
Um, well, for example...

25:29.440 --> 25:33.490
I got into college today, but there's
no way that my mom will let me go, so-

25:33.560 --> 25:35.483
- You got into college today?
- Mm-hmm.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.289
That's awesome!

25:37.360 --> 25:40.045
- Yeah. Thank you. In Philadelphia.
- Congratulations.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.044
Which is really cool,
'cause that's where my sister lives, but-

25:43.120 --> 25:46.044
Aimee, I don't know what to say.
That's- Dude, that's awesome.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.044
- Congratulations. Very cool.
- It's not that big of a deal.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.521
And there's no way
that I'll go, so-

25:51.600 --> 25:52.734
What are you talking about?

25:52.760 --> 25:55.027
Well, my mom- I have to
help her with the route.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.562
What does your mom have to do with this?
The route? The paper route?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.564
- Yes. She's alone-
- Aimee, your mom is a grown woman.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.450
She can take care
of the paper route herself.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.761
You are definitely
going to Philly.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.764
A hundred percent,
you're going to Philly.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.769
- Yeah, no. But I-
- Yeah, you are.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.121
There's no "buts" about it.
Don't you understand?

26:14.200 --> 26:17.124
You are this incredibly
gifted genius person...

26:17.200 --> 26:20.283
and you got all these people around you
telling you that you can't do shit.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.682
And that's gotta stop. You need
to start standing up for yourself.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.683
- How?
- How? I'll teach you.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.762
Take another swig
of that stuff.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.329
Get that down there.

26:30.440 --> 26:31.965
Down the hatch!

26:33.000 --> 26:34.843
Okay, now repeat after me.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.003
Mom, get off my
motherfuckin' back.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.285
- What?
- Yes.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.771
- No!
- Yeah.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.081
- I can't-
- Say it.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.162
Mom, get off of my back.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.163
No. You gotta do the "motherfucking."

26:48.240 --> 26:50.208
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.489
- Do it. Say it.
- Mom, get off of my... fucking back.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.847
- Motherfucking.
- Fuck! Motherfuck!

26:55.920 --> 26:57.570
- Go! Motherfuck- Yes!
- Motherfucking!

26:57.640 --> 26:59.563
Get off my motherfucking
back, Mom!

26:59.680 --> 27:00.920
<i>- Yes!
- God!</i>

27:01.000 --> 27:02.286
- God!
- Yeah!

27:02.360 --> 27:04.727
- Motherfuckin'! That's good!
- God, that feels awesome!

27:04.800 --> 27:06.723
Who else? Who else? I like this.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.724
I don't know- Stay out
of my motherfucking business, Kristal!

27:09.800 --> 27:12.963
- Fuck you, Kristal.
- Yeah, fuck you-

27:13.040 --> 27:15.566
- What about, uh, ex-boyfriends?
- Oh, my God.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.563
Uh
- We need an ex-boyfriend in there.

27:17.640 --> 27:19.290
No. I- I don't have any.

27:19.360 --> 27:22.682
Who's, like, an ex-boyfriend that really
pissed you off that you should, uh-

27:22.760 --> 27:25.001
that just, like, you hated
and they're just, like-

27:25.120 --> 27:27.043
I don't have an ex-boyfriend.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.531
- What?
- Yeah.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.126
You're 17 years old.
You don't have an ex-boyfriend?

27:31.200 --> 27:34.124
- No. Guys don't look at me like that.
- Really? That's shocking.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.123
- Absolutely, guys look at you like that.
- No, no, no.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.601
I just saw two guys look
at you like that.

27:38.680 --> 27:41.100
Erik Wolff and Cody Dennis
were 100% hitting on you.

27:41.126 --> 27:42.312
We were just talking.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.806
- No, no. There was absolutely no way-
- Yes, they were.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.943
Why don't you think
they were hitting on you?

27:46.969 --> 27:47.954
Because I'm just-

27:48.000 --> 27:50.665
Because you're what?
You're absolutely beautiful.

27:50.691 --> 27:52.235
Oh, my God. No!

28:20.400 --> 28:22.402
Try it? Yeah? Why not?

28:33.880 --> 28:36.087
<i>of course you're going to the prom.</i>

28:39.120 --> 28:41.122
<i>I'll take you.</i>

28:42.120 --> 28:44.122
Please go to the prom with me,
Aimee!

28:47.640 --> 28:49.802
Yes.

28:49.880 --> 28:52.645
<i>So you Te taking her to prom?</i>

28:52.720 --> 28:54.927
Yeah. it's no big deal.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.243
It's you making plans, Sutter.
It's kind of a big deal.

28:58.320 --> 29:02.006
Relax. I'm just trying
to help this girl out.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.163
- Right. I forgot. Sutter to the rescue.
- Exactly!

29:08.680 --> 29:11.809
And if she falls for you,
what happens then?

29:14.120 --> 29:16.726
Shut up!

29:16.800 --> 29:18.962
Are you kidding me?

29:22.480 --> 29:24.801
<i>Hey, Sutter.
It's Aimee.</i>

29:24.880 --> 29:28.123
<i>Um, I didn't know if we
were gonna study today or not...</i>

29:28.200 --> 29:31.249
<i>but I hadn't heard from you, so-</i>

29:31.320 --> 29:33.721
<i>Yeah, yesterday w-</i>

29:33.800 --> 29:36.644
<i>I had a really
great time with you.</i>

29:36.720 --> 29:40.167
<i>Um, thank you.</i>

29:40.240 --> 29:43.323
<i>Okay, I'll talk to
you later. Bye.</i>

30:11.560 --> 30:13.927
Or the lightning storm.

30:14.040 --> 30:16.202
- Mm-hmm.
- On the roof.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.762
That was amazing.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.123
I've... never felt like
that with anyone.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.123
It's not very often.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.929
Except with you.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.447
Actually, I think I'm
feeling it right now.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.443
I'm feeling a moment
right now.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.443
- Stop it.
- What? Cass, look. Seriously.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.928
When we're together,
it's like we're invincible or something.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.765
All this shit, all the world-
the responsibilities...

30:40.840 --> 30:42.569
all the problems, that stuff-

30:42.640 --> 30:44.961
Man, that just disappears
when I'm with you.

30:45.040 --> 30:48.726
But you can't just have fun all the time.
You have to be serious.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.723
Hey, I'm 100% serious.

30:50.800 --> 30:54.009
- About what?
- About not being serious.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.321
Did you even apply to college yet?

30:59.400 --> 31:01.528
I don't need college.
Who needs that shit?

31:01.600 --> 31:04.285
Look, it's not- I got
everything I need right here.

31:04.360 --> 31:08.524
I've got a job, I've got a car, I've got
a beautiful girl sitting next to me.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.843
You think beauty's in, like, some
classroom or some textbook, and it's not.

31:11.920 --> 31:15.367
That's not what it's about.
This right here. This is beautiful.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.044
All of this.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.044
That's all you need.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.689
You're drunk.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.842
I'm drunk?
Whatever! You're drunk!

31:26.920 --> 31:28.843
It doesn't matter.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.844
Okay, whatever. I'm right-
<i>You're</i> right.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.489
I'm just saying, you
gotta live in the moment.

31:34.515 --> 31:35.552
The moment? I-

31:38.480 --> 31:40.050
I want-

31:40.120 --> 31:43.044
I want more than
a moment.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.122
- I want-
- What?

31:46.880 --> 31:48.962
I want a future.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.521
And you can't do that.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.125
Wow.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.764
Wow.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.801
Um...

32:14.880 --> 32:16.644
okay.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.887
Please just go, Sutter.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.810
- Don't.
- Please just go.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.770
All right.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.243
What's up with you
and Cassidy?

32:47.360 --> 32:50.125
- Look, man, I don't want any trouble.
- Tell me the truth.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.770
Uh, nothing's up, man.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.763
She's moved on.
I've moved on.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.127
- You've moved on?
- We hang out, and we have f-

32:57.200 --> 32:58.850
Oh! Okay!
Come on. Come on.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.161
We have fun,
but there's nothing going on.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.844
I promise you.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.764
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.810
Why can't it be me that she has fun with?

33:19.880 --> 33:22.850
- What?
- Why can't it be me that she has fun with?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.571
I'm not like you.
I don't know how to make her laugh.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.041
Dude, you are Marcus West, man.

33:28.120 --> 33:32.011
You're the star athlete. You're
the class president. You are awesome!

33:32.080 --> 33:34.560
What's the name of that charity
that you started?

33:34.640 --> 33:36.005
The Hope Squadron.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.811
The fucking Hope Squadron, man!
That is awesome!

33:38.880 --> 33:42.680
- You do not need my help. You're the man.
- No, no, it's not the same.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.127
Okay, look, the way
she talks about you, man.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.601
I want her to like me like that,
and she doesn't.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.921
Marcus, trust me.
You don't want to be like me.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.082
Look, I make jokes, yeah.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.766
But, I mean, you get shit done.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.729
You're gonna change the world.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.121
You and Cass are perfect together.
Trust me.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.123
You're just too tense, man.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.123
A little tense.
You gotta loosen up. You know?

34:03.200 --> 34:06.329
- Yeah, yeah. Maybe.
- Not everything has to be so serious.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.761
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying you can relax.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.842
You know?
You're awesome.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.524
Enjoy being who you are.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.920
Live in the now.
Embrace that shit.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.684
Yeah.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.250
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh-

34:20.320 --> 34:22.721
Thanks for talking to me like this, Sutter.
I appreciate it.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.451
- Hey, absolutely, man. it's a pleasure.
- I appreciate it. I really do.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.568
- Anytime.
- Sorry about the, uh-

34:27.639 --> 34:29.210
it's cool.

34:29.280 --> 34:31.009
Good.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.969
- Hey, Sutter.
- Hmm?

34:39.280 --> 34:42.011
- You know, they're wrong about you.
- What's that?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.129
You're not the joke everyone thinks, man.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.562
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

35:03.640 --> 35:04.451
The king of Mexico?

35:04.477 --> 35:06.908
You're not gonna jerk your
way out of this, Sutter.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.924
Aimee told me about
your little party by the lake.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.923
- And?
- And now you're avoiding her.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.890
I'm not avoiding her.

35:12.916 --> 35:14.949
Really? Have you seen
her since the party?

35:15.000 --> 35:16.570
Have you even called?

35:16.640 --> 35:20.201
Why don't you get off my back a
little bit, give me some space.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.893
I knew she got that from you.
She said the exact same thing.

35:22.919 --> 35:23.946
Good. Good for her.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.924
No, it's not good for her.
Aimee isn't like you, Sutter.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.924
She's a sweet girl. She doesn't need
you causing problems in her life.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.288
What Aimee doesn't need is you bossing her
around like she's your personal assistant.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.930
You shouldn't treat her this way.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.684
Thank you. Good talk.

36:00.480 --> 36:03.086
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

36:03.160 --> 36:04.844
Nothing.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.844
What are you doing?
I didn't know you were coming over today.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.843
Yeah, I wasn't planning on coming over...

36:09.920 --> 36:12.844
but I was driving around and I thought,
I don't care how busy I am-

36:12.920 --> 36:14.843
I should see what Aimee is doing.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.161
So, what's- How are you doing?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.925
I'm good. I'm really good.
How are you, Sutter?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.684
- I'm- I'm good.
- Good.

36:21.760 --> 36:23.444
Yeah. Uh, hey, listen.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.444
My sister, she's having this fancy
dinner party for her friends...

36:26.520 --> 36:28.443
and she's making me go.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.443
I didn't know you had a sister.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.727
Yeah. We're not really that close. Yeah.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.882
But would you want to go with me?

36:34.960 --> 36:36.883
- To your- To dinner?
- Yeah.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.964
- Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay. Cool.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.804
Yeah. What time?

36:41.880 --> 36:43.325
Uh, 10 minutes.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.880
- Oh, 10 minutes from now? Okay.
- Yeah.

36:55.720 --> 36:59.361
So then I go back up to the table
and I say...

36:59.440 --> 37:01.647
"Can I get you boys anything else?"

37:01.720 --> 37:03.802
And then he says-

37:03.880 --> 37:06.281
Okay, I'm gonna let you say it.
What did you say?

37:06.360 --> 37:09.125
I leaned back in my chair,
puffed my chest out and I said...

37:09.200 --> 37:11.771
"You can give me your
number, gorgeous."

37:11.840 --> 37:15.367
That's right. And I didn't even know
that he was a big, fancy lawyer.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.602
I just gave it to him anyway.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.684
And I am so glad that I did.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.160
And she hasn't worked a
day in her life since.

37:23.186 --> 37:23.988
He's right.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.122
That's true.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.647
Wow. You guys sure are
a breath of fresh air.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.848
Well, thank you, Sutter.

37:31.920 --> 37:34.207
It's rare to see
such a happy couple nowadays.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.362
I feel like everyone's getting divorced.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.403
Well, that's not true.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.007
Isn't it?
Well, our parents. Aimee's parents.

37:42.080 --> 37:43.809
Most of my friends' parents.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.281
- Hmm. Kid's got a point.
- Thank you, Joe.

37:46.360 --> 37:46.961
Mine didn't.

37:46.987 --> 37:49.389
I thought you said your
parents were divorced.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.363
- No.
- There you go, Sutter. See?

37:51.440 --> 37:54.011
Not everything is doomed.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.529
My dad died.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.011
What?

38:00.720 --> 38:02.848
I am so sorry.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.161
No. it's okay.
it's not your fault.

38:05.187 --> 38:06.154
What happened?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.806
Uh, I mean,
he was a really great guy.

38:08.880 --> 38:13.647
He just kind of had, like, a slight
problem with painkillers mostly.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.529
Yeah.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.922
Kinda crazy.
He tried to stop a bunch of times.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.085
But my sister came home one day and he was
just lying there on the kitchen floor...

38:23.160 --> 38:26.721
and she had to, like,
close his eyes and everything.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.690
It was pretty... intense.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.649
Sorry.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.166
That was... really dark.

38:35.240 --> 38:38.528
Um, anyway, that's just-
I know that my marriage will work.

38:38.600 --> 38:41.046
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.043
I've thought it all out.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.488
My husband and I will both live
on a horse ranch...

38:46.560 --> 38:49.484
and I will work for NASA.

38:49.560 --> 38:52.086
And he'll do something
completely different.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.640
So that we offset each other. You know?

38:54.720 --> 38:56.643
We'll have some things in common...

38:56.720 --> 38:59.644
but then we'll also bring all these
different dimensions to the table...

38:59.720 --> 39:02.963
so that, you know,
life doesn't get boring.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.322
I know it's gonna work.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.448
Sounds like a dream.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.049
I think it's good to have dreams.
Don't you?

39:15.040 --> 39:16.724
Yeah.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.326
- To dreams.
-  To dreams.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.402
Mmm.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.882
- I wanna ask you something.
- Okay.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.008
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:32.080 --> 39:35.163
Did you mean what
you said at the party?

39:35.240 --> 39:38.005
What? Wh-

39:38.080 --> 39:40.651
- What?
- You know!

39:40.720 --> 39:42.290
- No, I don't.
- Yes.

39:42.400 --> 39:47.122
Like, the thing about,
like, the prom or whatever.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.168
Yeah, of course I remember that.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.204
Are you kidding me?
How could I forget something like that?

39:52.280 --> 39:54.282
No, I just mean, like...

39:54.360 --> 39:57.603
if you'd changed your mind
or you didn't want to go or anything...

39:57.680 --> 39:59.205
I'd totally get it.

39:59.280 --> 40:01.965
- What are you talking about?
- No, I just-

40:02.040 --> 40:04.964
I wouldn't have asked you to go
if I didn't want to go with you.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.361
- I know.
- I wouldn't-

40:07.440 --> 40:09.010
I wouldn't have.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.525
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.810
I'm just saying that I know people
change their minds.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.804
- Mm-mmm. Not me.
- And it's not that big of a deal.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.289
And I'm totally okay with
it if you want to not go.

40:20.315 --> 40:21.148
Listen to me.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.124
I would not have asked you
to go to the prom...

40:24.200 --> 40:27.647
if I didn't want
to go to the prom with you.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.883
- Really?
- Really.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.882
Okay.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.088
Come here.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.162
Come here.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.444
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.847
Sutter.
- What?

40:50.920 --> 40:52.922
Look, man.
It's under control.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.604
What's under control?

40:54.720 --> 40:58.202
Did it ever cross your mind
that maybe I'm attracted to that girl?

40:58.280 --> 41:00.203
No. No, not at all.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.204
Yeah, that's because
you haven't really looked at her.

41:03.280 --> 41:06.204
I'm telling you,
once you actually talk to her...

41:06.280 --> 41:08.203
you see who she is.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.568
I don't know, man.
She's really beautiful.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.688
"Beautiful"?
This isn't you, Sutter.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.206
- What, dude? Hey.
- You're gonna break her heart.

41:16.280 --> 41:20.285
Okay, well, worst-case scenario, I'm
just giving her the boyfriend experience.

41:20.360 --> 41:23.887
That's worst-case scenario?
No way. No.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.241
Okay, well- I don't know.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.244
You and I both know a month, tops,
she'll be done with me.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.244
- Then she'll move on.
- Okay, then if she doesn't, what happens?

41:32.320 --> 41:34.721
if she doesn't, that'll be a first.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.841
I like you so much.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.529
I like <i>you.</i>

41:52.560 --> 41:55.564
Should we...
take our shirts off?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.484
Yeah.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.328
You go first.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.890
All right.

42:09.640 --> 42:12.644
- Voilà.
- You're amazing.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.642
So amazing.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.004
Your turn.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.004
- I have to take mine off?
- Yeah.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.003
Don't laugh. Okay?

42:25.080 --> 42:27.606
Okay. I promise I won't laugh.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.603
- Wow.
- Stop. No. You promised.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.170
- What?
- Don't say anything.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.163
Are you kidding me? That's awesome.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.720
I like you, Sutter...

42:53.840 --> 42:55.763
so much.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.646
Do you wanna do this?

43:16.720 --> 43:18.484
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.970
- Do you?
- Mm-hmm.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.611
- Yeah? Okay.
- Hold on.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.163
- Here.
- Wow.

43:29.240 --> 43:32.050
- Where did you even get this from?
- I don't know.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.849
It's better.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.161
Good to be safe, huh?

43:36.240 --> 43:38.163
Got all your bases covered.

43:42.760 --> 43:44.410
You got it?

43:44.480 --> 43:46.926
- Uh, yeah.
- Do you need any help?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.082
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

43:49.160 --> 43:50.969
You okay?

43:51.040 --> 43:53.042
- Yeah.
- Okay.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.405
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

44:12.480 --> 44:13.970
Nothing.

44:14.040 --> 44:16.122
- You wanna do it?
- Yeah.

44:16.200 --> 44:17.884
- Hey.
- Yeah?

44:17.960 --> 44:20.884
I'm so glad that I met you.

44:20.960 --> 44:23.611
I'm so glad that I met you too.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.680
Okay.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.128
Go sl- Go slow.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.725
Go really slow.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.404
Okay?

44:44.040 --> 44:45.485
Sorry.

44:45.560 --> 44:47.164
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.290
- Okay.
- You okay?

44:51.360 --> 44:52.646
Yeah.

44:52.720 --> 44:54.324
Okay.

45:39.240 --> 45:41.163
Tell you a secret?

45:41.240 --> 45:42.765
What?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.047
My dad's not a pilot.

45:45.120 --> 45:45.994
What?

45:46.020 --> 45:49.514
Yeah, I actually don't
know what my dad does...

45:49.600 --> 45:51.921
or where he is.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.367
- What? Sutter.
- Yeah.

45:54.480 --> 45:58.246
I just made that up because he's
been gone for half my life...

45:58.320 --> 46:00.243
and...

46:00.360 --> 46:02.522
I guess I just miss him.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.250
Oh, my God.

46:04.320 --> 46:06.368
No one knows where he is?

46:06.440 --> 46:10.047
Um, my mom knows where he is,
but she won't tell me.

46:10.160 --> 46:11.605
- What?
- Yeah.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.921
She can't keep him from you.
He's your dad.

46:14.040 --> 46:15.485
I know. She does.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.005
She has.

46:17.080 --> 46:18.730
Sutter, that's not, like-

46:20.920 --> 46:22.331
What?

46:22.400 --> 46:24.004
Yeah.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.200
- I'll make you a deal.
- Mm-hmm?

46:29.280 --> 46:32.887
I will stand up to my mom
if you'll stand up to yours.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.210
What do you think?

46:40.760 --> 46:42.524
I think...

46:42.600 --> 46:44.602
that you're wonderful.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.604
Can I look?

46:56.320 --> 46:58.766
- Sorry I didn't get you a limo.
- That's okay.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.241
But this...

47:01.320 --> 47:03.766
is my way of
making it up to you.

47:03.880 --> 47:06.163
Okay, you totally did not
have to get me anything.

47:06.189 --> 47:07.307
I know. I wanted to.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.885
I wrapped it.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.371
- Should I open it?
- Yeah.

47:10.440 --> 47:11.965
- You wrapped this?
- In newspaper.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.963
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.565
Took me forever.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.130
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:17.200 --> 47:19.885
I don't even know what it is,
but thank you.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.243
- What?
- Yeah! I know. Do you like it?

47:25.360 --> 47:27.601
- I love it!
- Do you? All right. Good.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.001
- It has my name on it?
- Uh-huh.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.803
- Thank you.
- Glad you like it. You're welcome.

47:33.880 --> 47:37.930
- You did not need to do this.
- I know, but the best part is, it's full.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.168
- It <i>is</i> full.
- Yeah. Mostly.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.481
- Did you take a sip?
- I took a sip, made sure it worked.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.483
- For good luck?
- Yup. Okay.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.085
- Ready?
- Yeah.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.650
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.331
- To you, Aimee Finecky.
- To you, Sutter Keely.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.646
Oh. Hey.

48:06.720 --> 48:09.405
Whoo! Ricky!
Looking good, brother.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.970
Looking good.

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Hey.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.564

<i>♪ Everywhere we are,
people party like a rock star."</i>

48:38.200 --> 48:40.202
- Okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.691
- She's a good dancer.
- Hmm? Who?

48:46.760 --> 48:49.764
- Cassidy.
- Oh, I didn't notice.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.289
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.403

- Aimee, dance with me.
- No, no. I'm good.

49:20.360 --> 49:21.237
I don't really dance.

49:21.263 --> 49:23.309
But lucky for you, I'm
a phenomenal dancer.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.044
L-I can teach you some stuff.

49:25.120 --> 49:28.761
No, I'm fine. You guys-
You guys should go.

49:28.840 --> 49:32.162
- Are y-you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.930
Okay.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.968
All right. Good.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.085
Have fun.

49:44.400 --> 49:47.529
She looks very nice.
So, have you turned her into a lush yet?

49:47.600 --> 49:50.331
Uh, do you want to lecture me about it,
or you wanna dance?

49:50.400 --> 49:52.971
Okay. I wanna dance. I wanna dance.

49:59.640 --> 50:02.041
Pump the arms.
Pump the arms.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.202
Yep. That's what we're doing.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.483
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

50:19.880 --> 50:21.848
God, this is awesome.

50:24.280 --> 50:27.489
Seriously, like,
everybody's just singin'...

51:47.320 --> 51:49.129
- Sutter. Sutter.
- What?

51:49.200 --> 51:50.929
Guess what! Guess what!

51:51.000 --> 51:52.923
- My sister called me today-
- Uh-huh.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.925
And she said that she could
probably, almost 100% likely...

51:57.000 --> 51:59.162
get me a job at the bookstore.

51:59.240 --> 52:00.765
- In Philadelphia?
- Yes!

52:00.840 --> 52:03.969
- That's awesome. You love books.
- I know! I know. it's perfect.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.850
- That's the perfect job for you.
- It really is.

52:06.920 --> 52:11.482
It'll help pay for college, and-
 Yeah.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.244
You talk to your mom yet?

52:13.320 --> 52:14.890
No.

52:14.960 --> 52:17.247
But I will...

52:17.360 --> 52:20.364
eventually.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.850
It's pretty.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.725
- Okay.
- Hmm.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.768
Oh, sorry.

52:30.840 --> 52:32.763
Come here.
Sorry.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.850
So abusive.

52:37.920 --> 52:40.810
So-
Sorry.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.441
Uh, back to what I was saying.

52:44.520 --> 52:47.490
I have been thinking...

52:47.600 --> 52:50.080
a lot recently-

52:50.160 --> 52:52.527
a lot more than normal-

52:52.600 --> 52:56.082
and I think that you should come with me.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.689
- To-
- Philly.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.445
- Phila- Philly.
- Yes. Yes!

53:01.520 --> 53:03.966
- Uh-huh.
- I've been, like, looking all into it.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.884
And you can go to the
junior college...

53:06.960 --> 53:10.487
and we could both get
jobs downtown.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.847
It could be, like,
really awesome.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.964
Have you ever been to Philly?
Have you seen the Liberty Bell?

53:16.040 --> 53:18.486
- No.
- I-I haven't either, but-

53:18.560 --> 53:22.007
but the pictures of it
are really beautiful.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.082
It's awesome.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.845
You've been thinking about this
for a while, haven't you?

53:26.920 --> 53:29.321
- I have. I have. Yeah.
- Yeah?

53:29.400 --> 53:31.721
And, like, the coolest
thing ever, also...

53:31.800 --> 53:33.723
when I was talking to my sister-

53:33.800 --> 53:36.963
- Besides the Liberty Bell?
- Yes. There's just so many cool things!

53:37.040 --> 53:41.090
She said that there's,
like, tons of vacancies avail-

53:41.160 --> 53:43.527
- Listen to me. I'm talking.
- I'm listening. I'm listening.

53:43.600 --> 53:47.844
Um, she said there's, like, tons
of vacancies available in her building...

53:47.920 --> 53:49.922
because of, like,
the economy and stuff, so-

53:50.000 --> 53:53.527
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, we could totally just move there...

53:53.600 --> 53:55.568
at the end of June, together.

53:55.640 --> 53:59.361
And it would be really inexpensive
and awesome and-

54:01.320 --> 54:03.971
What do you think?

54:04.040 --> 54:07.362
Uh, I think that's great.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.920
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.803
I, uh- I did it.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.405
What?

54:19.480 --> 54:21.482
Talked to my mom.

54:21.560 --> 54:23.403
I just walked in and I said...

54:23.480 --> 54:26.051
"It's my life, and I'm not gonna
let you stand in the way of it."

54:26.120 --> 54:28.407
- How'd that go?
- It was pretty ugly at first.

54:28.480 --> 54:31.324
Said all these things
and tried to guilt me into staying...

54:31.400 --> 54:35.610
but I just said, "Look,
if I can afford it, then I'm leaving...

54:35.680 --> 54:38.490
and there's really not anything
you can do about it."

54:38.560 --> 54:40.642
- That's awesome. I'm proud of you.
- Yeah.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.485
Thank you. I'm proud of me.

54:43.560 --> 54:45.562
It wasn't that bad. You'll see.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.563
- What?
- When you do it.

54:47.680 --> 54:50.843
- What are you talking about?
- Sutter! We had a deal.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.764
Uh, yeah. I don't know.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.810
What? You can totally do it.
Trust me.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.644
- Different.
- No.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.722
Okay, look.
Repeat after me.

55:00.800 --> 55:02.723
Say, "I want to call my dad, Mom.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.929
I want to motherfucking call him."

55:06.000 --> 55:07.968
That's not fair.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.762
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.127
- Just wanted to ask you something.
- Okay.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.362
- What is it?
- It's about Dad.

55:20.520 --> 55:23.251
- Oh, Sutter.
- I wanna talk to him.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.164
- Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

55:27.560 --> 55:28.354
He's my dad.

55:28.380 --> 55:31.556
And I'm your mom, and
you live under my roof.

55:31.640 --> 55:34.291
Okay. Well, I just wanna call him.

55:35.440 --> 55:37.124
Sutter, this is my job.

55:37.200 --> 55:41.046
We can have this conversation later.
Okay?

55:41.120 --> 55:43.122
No wonder he left you.

55:58.920 --> 56:01.400
How do you like the landscaping
we did back here?

56:01.480 --> 56:04.484
Joe and I planted some day lilies back
there. I don't know if you saw them.

56:04.560 --> 56:06.448
Yeah, it looks really good.
Looks really good.

56:06.474 --> 56:07.236
Really pretty.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.726
Hey, Holl, I was talking on the phone.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.802
I wanted to ask
you about Dad.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.486
- You wanna dredge that up, huh?
- "Dredge"? What are you-

56:14.600 --> 56:17.080
Dad's not somebody that
you dredge. He's-

56:17.160 --> 56:19.322
He's awesome.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.370
Hey, do you remember? He used to tell
us stories in the tent in the backyard.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.960
- You remember that?
- I think that was mostly you.

56:25.040 --> 56:28.089
Okay, well, do you remember
when we made that trip down to Mexico...

56:28.160 --> 56:30.891
and he had us going up to people asking
where the Belt Buckle Museum was?

56:30.960 --> 56:34.646
And why is there no
artichoke ice cream?

56:34.720 --> 56:38.281
That was hilarious!
Don't look at- It was funny.

56:38.360 --> 56:39.466
It was embarrassing.

56:39.492 --> 56:42.310
No, it wasn't. It was funny.
People loved us.

56:42.360 --> 56:46.285
They loved you because
you were little and cute.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.841
The guys liked you.
They loved you.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.924
Thought you were a hot little <i>muchacha.</i>
Mm-hmm.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.764
- You liked it.
- Well-

56:54.840 --> 56:55.708
Yeah. Uh-huh.

56:55.734 --> 56:58.870
He did know how to
make friends at least.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.604
Damn right, he did.

57:03.160 --> 57:06.960
So, do you know what happened
between him and Mom?

57:07.040 --> 57:09.042
He cheated on her.

57:09.120 --> 57:12.124
Yeah, well,
that's her version of it.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.765
And you think it's a lie?

57:13.840 --> 57:17.242
I don't think she's lying, but I think
there's two sides to every story.

57:17.320 --> 57:18.810
- Think about it.
- Sutter-

57:18.880 --> 57:21.645
She won't let us see him.
She won't even let us know where he is.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.724
Let's talk about something else.
How is your friend Aimee?

57:24.800 --> 57:27.087
You gotta admit it's
a little suspicious.

57:27.160 --> 57:31.006
She won't even give me his phone number.
I can't talk to the guy.

57:32.920 --> 57:36.481
Every time that I ask her for his number,
she refuses to give it to me.

57:37.560 --> 57:40.609
Can you please ask her
for his number for me?

57:43.480 --> 57:44.970
Please.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.646
I don't have to ask her.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.964
I know where he is.

57:55.040 --> 57:57.168
What?

58:27.120 --> 58:29.885
Thank you. Thanks.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.810
Thanks.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.528
- Hey, Sutter?
- Mm-hmm?

58:41.880 --> 58:44.360
Come by for lunch sometime, okay?

58:45.560 --> 58:47.050
Okay. I will.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.610
Promise.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.724
<i>Hello.</i>

59:13.800 --> 59:16.007
Um... Dad?

59:16.080 --> 59:18.731
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>

59:18.800 --> 59:21.406
No, it's- it's me, Sutter.

59:21.480 --> 59:22.970
<i>Sutter?</i>

59:27.040 --> 59:28.883
<i>Well, Sutter, h-how you doin'?</i>

59:29.000 --> 59:30.684
Uh, yeah, I'm all right.

59:30.760 --> 59:34.970
<i>You sound like a-
You sound like a man from here now.</i>

59:35.040 --> 59:38.567
<i>Well, yeah, you, uh-
Well, hey, you still playing ball?</i>

59:38.640 --> 59:40.449
What?

59:40.520 --> 59:43.842
<i>I mean, your arm-
I mean, you were small for your age...</i>

59:43.920 --> 59:46.127
<i>but you were a
hell of a pitcher.</i>

59:46.200 --> 59:48.487
<i>You still playing ball?</i>

59:48.560 --> 59:53.088
Wow. Yeah, I'm surprised
that you remember that, Dad.

59:53.160 --> 59:56.881
<i>What are you talking about, do I remember
that? of course I remember that.</i>

59:56.960 --> 59:58.485
<i>You still throwing?</i>

59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.087
No, not really.
Haven't thrown much lately.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.841
<i>Oh. Well, ifs a shame. You were a hell
of a pitcher. You had a great arm.</i>

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.002
<i>So, how-</i>

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.369
<i>So how's your, uh- How's your mom
and, uh- and Holly doing?</i>

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.205
They're- They're good.
Yeah, real good.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.011
<i>Oh, good, good.
That's tremendous, Son. That's good</i>

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.890
That's good.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.962
Listen, Dad, um-

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.929
I was- Can I come see
you sometime?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.651
<i>Come see me?
Of course you can come see me.</i>

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.961
<i>What do you mean,
can you come see me?</i>

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.725
<i>You can come see me
any damn time you want to see me.</i>

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:36.552
<i>Really?</i>

01:00:36.578 --> 01:00:39.426
<i>What do you mean, really?
Of course you can come see me.</i>

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:44.441
<i>Yeah, you come over like Friday
around 3:00, maybe we go see a game.</i>

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.443
Yeah. Uh- Wow. Really, Dad?

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.488
Dad, that would be-
that'd be so great.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:50.722
I'd really like- like that.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.250
How much further is it?

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.971
Uh, it's about three hours.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.248
Hey, Aim, thank you.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.369
- For what?
- I wouldn't have done this without you.

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.882
All right. Here we are.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.405
I think I need that shot
of whiskey now.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.403
- Knock again?
- Yeah.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.570
Yeah?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.925
Hey.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.289
Dad, uh, I-it's Sutter.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.011
Oh, shit. Of course.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:48.765
You, uh- Oh, man. I, uh-

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.368
Look at you.
Of course. You, uh-

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.520
- You're taller than I am.
- Yeah, I grew a lot last summer.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.810
Yeah. You, uh- I was, uh-
No, I was just, um-

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.850
- I was-
- How are you? Come here.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.445
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.369
- Hey. And who, uh-
- Oh, sorry. This is Aimee.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.204
- Hi.
- This is my girlfriend.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.044
- Aimee, that's my dad.
- Aimee, how do you do?

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.727
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.490
It's very nice to see that, uh-

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.370
to see that Sutter's got
immaculate taste in the ladies.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.728
He, uh- He gets that
from his old man, you know.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.929
He gets that from his old man.
Look at you.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.163
Uh, you caught me
at just a bad time right now.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.130
Just headin' out. I was gonna head out,
catch up with friends of mine.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.921
But since you're here now,
if you wanna come along, that'd be great.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.604
- Yeah.
- Would you like to do that?

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.923
- Yeah. I would love to, right?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.527
Is that all right? Listen, if you take
your car, you can follow me up there.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.002
It's just up the street.
We'll go get a drink. Sound good?

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.929
- Yeah, cool. Yeah, let's do it.
- All right.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.122
Hey, guys.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:00.249
Hey, this is my son, Sutter.
Sutter, this is the guys.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.685
Hey, boy.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.321
And this- this is the most beautiful
woman in the entire state.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.402
This is Roberta.
How you doin'?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.403
Last week you said "the country."

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.289
I meant the entire country.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.045
And this, again,
is the amazing Sutter Keely.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.250
Roberta.
And this is his amazing lady friend, um-

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.845
- Aimee.
- Aimee.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.481
Get your good looks
from your mother, did ya?

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.528
Oh. Oh.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.721
She can be
touchy sometimes.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.610
Hey, listen, go sit down over there.
I'll get us some drinks.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.170
- All right?
- The booth?

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.730
Yeah.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.888
Hey, Sal.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.531
Give me two pitchers.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.809
You've never been
to Key West?

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:56.370
No.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.124
Key West is the place to be.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.809
Key West has got sunsets
that are like butterscotch sundaes...

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.882
with strawberry swirl mixed in.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.247
And it just melts right into the ocean.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.005
And everybody
has got a drink in their hand...

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.208
and a smile on their face.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.362
That's Key West.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.169
- Wow.
- That sounds perfect.

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.086
It was perfect, and I wish you
could have been there with me.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.811
So how come you left?

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.161
What do you mean,
how come I left?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.210
Key West.
How come you left Key West?

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.443
'Cause I ran out of money.
That's why I left Key West.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.081
If I could have stayed down there,
I would have, believe me.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.842
Hey, I'm gonna play a song
on that jukebox.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.003
Good. Do that.
You do that, I'll get us a refill.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.764
All right.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.770
Good.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.047
Mmm. Yes.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.724
That's it.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.768
That's the song.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.810
<i>♪ I wanna live fast,
love hard, die young ♪</i>

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.611
<i>♪And leave a beautiful memory♪</i>

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.570
<i>♪ I wanna live fast,
love hard, die young ♪♪</i>

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.085
Fresh pitcher.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.083
All right. Here we go.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.367
Oh.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.204
Here you go, buddy.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.770
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.922
- Miss Aimee.
- Thank you.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.408
<i>It's pretty good, huh?</i>

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.767
- Thank you. What's that?
- The song.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.530
You like the song?

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.001
This?

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.082
Yeah, it's all right.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.322
This was always
your mother's kind of thing.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.209
Mom?

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.044
What do you-
This is fun.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.851
I can't imagine Mom
listening to fun music like this.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.649
What the hell are you talking about?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.406
When I married your mother, your mother
was more fun than anyone I knew.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.482
Your mother was the definition of fun.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.483
There was nobody more fun than-

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.848
You know what? Don't say
anything bad about your mother here.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.765
So, uh, what happened?

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:26.969
What do you mean, what happened?

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.487
Between you and Mom, what happened?

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.201
Things didn't work out.
That's what happened.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.326
Yeah, well, you know,
she blames you for everything.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.129
Well-

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.123
I defend you. I always defend you.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.807
Well, I appreciate that, because
you know what? It wasn't all my fault.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.201
Yeah, exactly.
There's two sides to every story.

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.089
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.128
And no matter what happened
between you guys...

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.044
she shouldn't have kicked you
out of the house like that.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.927
Your mother didn't kick me
out of the house.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.444
What do you mean?

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:09.321
I mean, your mother didn't
kick me out of the house. I left.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.084
Huh?

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.681
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.522
I had to leave. I wanted
to be there for you. I really did.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.807
More than anything in the world,
I wanted to.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.848
You guys meant more to me than anything.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.526
But the fact of the matter is that things
between your mother and I...

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.602
they were very uncool.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.001
I guess you could say I wasn't
cut out to be a family man,

01:07:33.027 --> 01:07:34.226
not in the traditional sense.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.324
I did some things that I'm not proud of.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.368
But I'll tell you something.
I don't live in the past.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.920
I live in the now
because that's what it's all about.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.889
Do you understand that?

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.126
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:55.246
I think that might be a great idea.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.408
- Hey, uh-
- Yeah?

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.563
Do me a favor, will you? Pick up this tab
real quick. I'll be right back.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.766
Dad.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.291
I didn't even know you had a son.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.203
Thanks for that info.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.407
Uh
- Hey.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.448
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.205
- It's okay.
- Well, gotta pay the tab.

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:26.282
He doesn't have
any money.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.607
Do you havesome-
Do you have money?

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.886
- Yeah.
- This isn't enough.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.287
- That's all you got?
- Listen, uh-

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.886
Roberta's had too much to drink...

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.725
so I'm gonna give her a ride home,
if you know what I mean.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.404
- All right?
- You want us to follow you?

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.488
No, no, no.
There's no need for that.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.448
I won't be more
than an hour.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.126
I mean, Dad, we're not doing anything.
We can totally come.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:55.837
We can follow you.

01:08:55.863 --> 01:08:57.705
That's not necessary.
You know what'd be best?

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.411
You guys just meet me
back at my place.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:03.926
Yeah, Dad,
we came all this way to see you.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.127
I know you did,
and I'm glad you did.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.567
But I'll meet you back at my place
in about an hour.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.609
- Is that good?
- Uh, yeah.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.365
- Yeah, that's fine.
- We can do that. Yeah.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:17.410
All right. All right. I'll see you then.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.005
Yep.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.130
- We should head back.
- Hmm?

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:39.737
Hmm?

01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:41.910
Let's keep waiting.
It's only been- Sutter!

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.126
I'm sure that he
wanted to come back.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.690
Aimee.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.161
No, if it wasn't for her,
I'm sure he would have come right back.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.368
Yeah, and if he didn't
cheat on my mom...

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:34.241
then we'd still be a family, and I'd be
president of my Sunday school class.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.530
Sutter.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.045
What?

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.650
I love you.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.724
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.804
- Sutter, I love you.
- No, you don't.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.771
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. You're wrong.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.002
Sutter, I'm not wrong.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.844
- You don't love me.
- Yes, I do!

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.649
You're wrong.
You don't love me. Okay?

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.485
You're just drunk and grateful that somebody
came along and showed interest in you.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.167
Okay, stop. Stop.
Do not try and mess this up.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.163
Mess what up?
What do you think that this is, Aimee?

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.651
- What are you talk- Sutter!
- Whoa!

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:24.401
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.006
- What?
- Are you all right?

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.809
- No.
- Are you hurt? ls there anything-

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.929
Aimee, stop!
No, I'm not. I'm far from okay.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.604
- Jesus.
- Are you hurt?

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.091
Aimee, what is the matter with you?

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.288
I almost just killed you,
and you want to know if I'm okay!

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.169
Yeah, I wanna make sure
that you're okay.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.810
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.645
Do you not see that
I am bad for you?

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.200
- You need to get away from me!
- What are you talking about?

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.483
You need to get the fuck away from me!
Aimee, get out of my car.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.528
No, I'm not gonna get
out of your car!

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.809
Get out of my car.
Get the fuck out of my car! Get out!

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:58.202
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh, my God, Sutter.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.929
Jesus Christ!

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.684
I'm sorry, Sutter.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.842
Holy fuck! Aimee!

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.244
<i>Dr. Brandon, 2744.</i>

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:19.043
<i>Dr. Brandon, 2744.</i>

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:27.130
Give you a choice, kid.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.123
The cops or your parents.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:46.329
He's lucky. So is his girlfriend.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.085
Not everyone gets a second chance.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.724
Sutter.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.565
Now.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.088
It's not an "F".

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.282
I thought you were gettin' help.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.807
I am.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:59.761
All right, well, you need a "C" on
the final, or you fail my class.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.649
I'll- I'll try harder.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.370
No, you won't.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:08.008
I don't get you, Sutter.
You're a smart kid, thoughtful.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.528
Do you even want to graduate?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.126
I- I don't know.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.407
- Excuse me?
- I'm just being honest with you.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.404
Like, I don't know.
Everyone's telling me I gotta move on.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.370
I don't see what's so great
about being an adult.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.050
Are you happy

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.011
Hi.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.602
Hey. How you feeling?

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.722
I'm good. How are you?

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:03.041
It's good to see you.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.562
Shall we talk about it?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.525
I agree.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.724
- I'm so sorry, Aimee.
- Sutter, stop.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.802
- Okay.
- It's okay.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.042
I know. it's okay.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.051
We can just pretend
that it, like, never happened.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.329
We don't ever have to talk
about it again. Okay?

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.768
I don't want anything
to get in the way of Philly.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.447
You're all that matters to me.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.011
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.447
- Look. Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.363
- Hold this.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.845
Oops.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.327
- Want some?
- No. I'm okay.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.562
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm good.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.165
Okay.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.768
- Is your family here?
- Nah, I told them it was next week.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.525
Yup. Yeah.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.011
Okay.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.046
Oh, hey.
I should probably go say hi to her.

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.610
Okay.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.683
We are so proud of you.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.409
Can you hold this?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.169
Well, we made it.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.208
Yeah, I guess we did.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.881
- I'm really glad.
- Yeah.

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.486
I'm really proud of you, Sutter.
Congratulations.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.080
Uh, so when are you going to Texas?

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.763
I thought that you heard.
I'm not going to Texas.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:01.930
I'm going with Marcus.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.843
California.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.490
That's right.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.006
What? Cass.

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.771
- Sutter.
- Come on, man. Are you serious?

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.128
I mean, don't you think
that's, like, a little-

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.089
- What?
- I don't know.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.004
It seems a little-

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.209
- You're really going?
- Yes, I'm really going.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.284
Congratulations.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.448
Well, maybe I'll, you know...

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.522
like, come visit you guys or something.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.563
Never been to California.
It'd be cool.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.927
I don't think that's
a very good idea, Sutter.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.842
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.968
Yeah, it's not- probably not cool.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.407
Sorry.
It's just-

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.608
- I'm
- Hey, I get it. It's cool.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.651
I'm trying to do things right now
that aren't bad for me.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.531
I get it.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:57.126
It's cool. it's cool.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.769
Sutter.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.009
I'm not mad at you.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.605
I know.

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:19.484
You'll always be my
favorite ex-boyfriend.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.765
Utter.
Yeah.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.842
Pop upstairs, would ya?

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.281
You've probably noticed,
uh, we haven't been too busy these days.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.888
And, uh, because of that,
I can only keep one clerk.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.889
Now, I like you, Sutter...

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.169
but more importantly,
the customers like you...

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.925
so I think you should be the one I keep.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.525
That's excellent.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.250
Eh-oh. O-one second.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.362
I've given this some
hard thought...

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.762
and, uh, the only way
I can let you stay...

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.446
is if you promise me 100%...

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.842
that you will never
come in here loaded again.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.005
And I'm serious.
N-Not even a light buzz. All right?

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:23.003
Because if you do...

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.128
then I have to let you go.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.282
You understand.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.964
I do.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.963
So...

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.804
can you promise?

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.088
You got me there, Dan.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:42.042
You know I can't promise you that.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.131
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:53.486
I've always been
up front with you.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.650
Thanks for the opportunity.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.210
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.487
Uh, I suppose if I was your father...

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.564
this is where I might give you
a lecture or something...

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:11.644
about what you're
doing to yourself.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:14.923
Well, Dan, if you were my dad,
you wouldn't have to.

I'm gonna have to go.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:30.242
Okay. Thanks.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:00.605
So- Yeah, do you think
I did the right thing?

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.365
For you, or for her?

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:07.445
You had to let her go.
You had to save that girl.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:10.205
That's what I'm s-
I saved her. I saved her.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.888
You're not wrong.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.123

- Absolutely.

Sutter!

Is that why you hate me, Mom?

You can't even stand
to look at me, can you?

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.041

You're my son!

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.482

I'm exactly like him.

I'll give you your dad's number,
and you can go to him and see.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.450
- See how different you are.
- I thought you didn't want me to see him.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.047
I was- I was trying
to protect you from-

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.408
I was wrong, okay?
So I want you to go now.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.006
I already went.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:37.244
Holly gave me his number.
I drove up there last week and I saw him.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.806
You were right, Mom.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.770
- Sutter.
- You were right the whole time.

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.808
You are not your father.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.320
Sutter, listen to me.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:55.281
Listen to me. That man- That man
has never loved anyone but himself.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.886
His heart is this big.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.123
But you-
you love everybody.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.602
You have the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.122
When you were in third grade, and Ricky
was on crutches- Do you remember that?

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.441
You carried his books.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.370
Carried that backpack
every day.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.802
And when you were nine and
Rosemary Clark lost her mother?

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.281
You invited her to come live with us.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:22.563
You told her that I
would be her new mom.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:28.009
You've always been
so special, Sutter.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.647
That's why everyone
loves you so much.

01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:33.722
Nobody loves me.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.927
