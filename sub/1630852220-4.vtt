03:23.943 --> 03:25.943
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.539
- Did you call your friend?
- First thing I did.

03:31.541 --> 03:34.138
- What did she say?
- It's all set up.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.897
Leena will get it done, you'll see.

03:36.899 --> 03:39.176
I've known her for 15 years,
she's a Mack truck.

03:39.178 --> 03:42.494
Now she's gone into business
with a genius of finance

03:42.496 --> 03:46.295
and I checked their acquisitions
over recent years, all blue chip.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.451
Thank you.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.969
Gennaro, you need to relax.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.245
I need to relax, Alberto?

04:13.645 --> 04:17.041
All I know is until a few days ago
everything was going well,

04:17.043 --> 04:19.880
now if I don't buy an international
company in two weeks,

04:19.882 --> 04:22.402
like fuck I'll open the airport.

04:23.721 --> 04:27.518
That's not a good thing,
neither for me nor for you.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.239
Don't ever forget that.

04:38.435 --> 04:40.595
Hello?

04:44.553 --> 04:46.193
Good.

04:48.432 --> 04:50.871
They've arrived.

05:09.544 --> 05:12.143
Get it done now,
we don't have a minute to lose.

05:20.140 --> 05:22.779
- See you here in an hour.
- Right.

05:37.928 --> 05:39.022
Hello.

05:39.024 --> 05:40.067
Gennaro Savastano.

05:40.069 --> 05:41.279
Ah, Mr. Savastano.

05:41.281 --> 05:44.018
Our bank manager, Mr. Cormack
is waiting for you.

05:45.932 --> 05:48.303
Mr. Savastano,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

05:49.107 --> 05:50.396
This way, please.

07:08.246 --> 07:10.496
So, Mr. Savastano...

07:10.791 --> 07:12.702
You put in your personal code,

07:12.796 --> 07:14.164
and here is your key card.

07:15.327 --> 07:18.533
If you need anything else, let me know.

07:18.535 --> 07:20.415
Thank you.

08:10.003 --> 08:11.190
Hello.

08:11.278 --> 08:12.646
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:26.550 --> 08:29.149
- Leena!
- Alberto!

08:29.790 --> 08:31.372
I'm so glad to see you.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.287
This is the person
I told you about,

08:33.303 --> 08:35.583
my partner, Mr. Gennaro Savastano.

08:38.076 --> 08:40.505
- Lovely to meet you.
- Please sit down.

08:45.061 --> 08:47.897
- Do you want something? A coffee?
- No, thank you.

08:47.930 --> 08:50.188
I found what you asked for.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.023
Or rather, my partner, Patrick did.

08:53.098 --> 08:54.427
He's fantastic.

08:54.471 --> 08:56.823
But, given the short notice,
it wasn't easy.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.084
In the end, we were lucky.

09:00.285 --> 09:01.114
Anyway...

09:01.153 --> 09:04.146
I'm sure that you're in a hurry,
so... shall we go?

09:04.260 --> 09:07.416
Patrick's waiting for us at the office
with more details.

09:07.694 --> 09:10.054
- He said that Patrick...
- I understood.

09:17.251 --> 09:18.353
Let's go.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.629
It's this-this way.

09:40.866 --> 09:42.647
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

09:42.784 --> 09:44.151
Patrick...

09:47.693 --> 09:50.092
Patrick Calvis, it's a pleasure.

09:50.183 --> 09:51.714
Gennaro Savastano.

09:52.213 --> 09:53.697
- Patrick.
- Alberto Resta,

09:53.743 --> 09:54.954
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.005
Please come in, take a seat.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.444
- Can I get anyone a coffee?
- No, thank you, Leena.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.185
Yes, please.

10:01.317 --> 10:02.317
Harry?

10:03.964 --> 10:07.782
So Leena tells me you've just
a couple of weeks to close the deal.

10:08.503 --> 10:10.464
Let's get straight to the point, sir.

10:20.491 --> 10:21.756
Wimpro.

10:21.804 --> 10:23.741
Market value: Â£20 million.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.899
The price is not an issue.

10:40.351 --> 10:42.792
Well... well, Patrick...
But...

10:42.867 --> 10:45.094
if it's so, why do they need to sell?

10:45.171 --> 10:46.576
In the past year,

10:46.659 --> 10:48.612
Wimpro made some bad investments.

10:48.655 --> 10:50.514
Not through it's own fault,

10:50.983 --> 10:54.589
now, they've been exposed and
they need to close a contract ASAP.

10:54.652 --> 10:55.316
But...

10:55.340 --> 10:58.135
they haven't got the money
to do so all by themselves.

10:58.508 --> 11:00.000
So, apparently...

11:00.083 --> 11:03.099
Wimpro need you
more than you need them.

11:03.599 --> 11:05.178
We just have to let them know.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.540
Now, it's up to you.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.288
Did you get that
or do I have to translate?

11:34.239 --> 11:36.279
Well? How's it going?

11:38.278 --> 11:40.277
For the moment, everything's okay.

11:45.715 --> 11:47.193
Here's Gaetano.

11:47.195 --> 11:51.271
- Who's that?
- A person who works for me in London.

11:51.273 --> 11:54.112
- Welcome, Mrs. Savastano.
- Thank you.

11:57.871 --> 12:00.030
Do you think it's good?

12:04.508 --> 12:07.745
We have to go home
with an international company

12:07.747 --> 12:10.064
to head up the consortium

12:10.066 --> 12:13.944
or else Casillo's friend won't give us
the contract for the airport.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.982
So you've already decided?

12:26.331 --> 12:28.018
- For you, madam.
- Thank you.

12:30.436 --> 12:31.538
And for you, sir.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:41.534 --> 12:45.453
They asked me
to make an irrevocable bid.

12:47.532 --> 12:49.891
An irrevocable bid?

12:54.969 --> 12:56.608
And I did.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.709
This city has always
made me feel anxious.

13:52.148 --> 13:54.107
Me too.

14:20.331 --> 14:22.128
- Is everything okay?
- Not really.

14:22.292 --> 14:23.956
- We have a problem.
- What's happened?

14:23.989 --> 14:26.974
The owners, the Mayers family
have asked for a partners meeting.

14:27.027 --> 14:28.527
It's starting as we speak.

14:28.603 --> 14:31.447
We're going to try to get the others
to reject your offer.

14:32.213 --> 14:35.369
The owners want to reject the offer.

14:35.371 --> 14:39.010
- Can they do that?
- If they convince the majority, yes.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.620
Patrick's there already.
You need to try to convince them.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.643
My car's waiting outside.

14:58.104 --> 14:59.768
It's here.
Go to the back entrance.

15:03.451 --> 15:05.803
You're not allowed
into the shareholders meeting.

15:05.901 --> 15:07.526
We can't walk in the front door.

15:51.889 --> 15:53.944
Apparently, the meeting
hasn't started yet.

15:53.977 --> 15:55.477
It'll be a couple of minutes.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.590
Did you see those
two men I was talking to?

16:38.411 --> 16:40.888
- Mm-hmm.
- They are the men we need to persuade.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.111
They belong to the
anti-Mayers faction.

16:43.443 --> 16:46.661
They claim the Mayers'
management has damaged the business.

16:46.715 --> 16:50.161
They hold 7% and 5% respectively.

16:50.629 --> 16:54.348
They can convince the other 39%
to sell to you.

16:54.935 --> 16:57.747
- So we need them on our side.
- Definitely.

17:08.634 --> 17:10.590
Azzurra?

17:10.593 --> 17:13.071
I sent you a message
with the instructions.

17:15.431 --> 17:17.471
Gaetano is coming to get you.

17:57.336 --> 17:59.893
- Haven't they arrived yet?
- No. Did you bring them?

17:59.895 --> 18:02.854
- They're here. Good morning, Alberto.
- Good morning.

18:07.812 --> 18:09.849
- Want a coffee?
- No.

18:09.851 --> 18:11.490
It's disgusting anyway.

18:18.770 --> 18:20.235
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Leena.

18:20.282 --> 18:21.321
Hello.

18:22.919 --> 18:25.216
John Millivan, Bernard Edgewood.

18:25.240 --> 18:26.302
Please, have a seat.

18:26.321 --> 18:29.985
I'd like to present Alberto Resta,
Gennaro Savastano

18:30.163 --> 18:32.343
and Azzurra Avitabile.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.100
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

18:34.763 --> 18:35.474
So...

18:35.959 --> 18:37.404
our project...

18:37.535 --> 18:42.473
is to build the biggest airport
ever built on Italian soil.

18:43.810 --> 18:44.841
Yours...

18:45.398 --> 18:49.867
is to get rid of... of the leadership
who doesn't go anywhere.

18:51.232 --> 18:52.396
What do you think about?

18:56.066 --> 18:57.566
Be practical.

18:59.262 --> 19:01.176
We know your business
is in trouble.

19:01.329 --> 19:04.071
If you don't close a contract
in the next few months,

19:04.162 --> 19:07.154
you risk going bankrupt
and losing everything.

19:07.483 --> 19:08.795
On the other hand,

19:08.854 --> 19:11.502
we have the opportunity to close
one of the biggest

19:11.565 --> 19:13.775
infrastructure projects in Italy.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.405
But to do so,
we need a company like yours.

19:16.449 --> 19:17.973
It's a win-win situation.

19:18.055 --> 19:19.390
You just have to say yes.

19:19.430 --> 19:21.383
And convince your associates...

19:21.822 --> 19:23.775
to accept our offer.

19:24.952 --> 19:26.108
It's not for free...

19:26.926 --> 19:28.035
of course.

20:00.321 --> 20:01.853
I've spoken to the board.

20:03.838 --> 20:05.767
You are, now, the majority owner.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.783
They have accepted your bid.

20:08.909 --> 20:11.151
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.212
- Congratulations, Alberto.
- Thank you.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.880
You're already up?

20:28.079 --> 20:29.678
I'll help you.

20:34.437 --> 20:36.676
I'm proud of you, Gennaro.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.073
See you later at the office?

20:53.749 --> 20:55.389
Well?

20:56.988 --> 20:59.827
Good one, Gaetano.
I'll be right down.

22:15.288 --> 22:16.858
Everything is fine.

22:17.880 --> 22:18.973
It's done.

22:19.036 --> 22:20.404
It's real now.

22:20.663 --> 22:24.257
Leena, could you send us all
the documents by mail today please?

22:24.313 --> 22:26.274
We need them for our associates

22:26.309 --> 22:27.231
for a fast check.

22:27.271 --> 22:30.007
- Of course. Leena, you can do that?
- Of course.

22:30.176 --> 22:31.153
Thank you.

22:44.228 --> 22:48.146
Michele. We did it.

22:49.346 --> 22:51.543
The paperwork's on its way to you,

22:51.545 --> 22:55.024
check immediately that it's all okay,
before we go to the notary.

22:56.463 --> 22:58.982
I need to know straightaway.

23:15.416 --> 23:17.493
Thanks.

23:17.495 --> 23:19.015
Cheers!

23:20.854 --> 23:22.891
Check this out, Alberto.

23:22.893 --> 23:26.370
- What is it?
- Dunno.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.331
Looks good, though.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.767
It's Casillo.

23:39.807 --> 23:41.566
Michele.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.325
I can't hear you.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.364
Now I can.

23:53.962 --> 23:55.761
What?

24:04.558 --> 24:06.437
I'll take care of it now.

24:08.116 --> 24:09.716
What did he say?

24:12.355 --> 24:14.312
There's a document missing,

24:14.314 --> 24:19.190
the banks' approval
for the transfer of ownership.

24:19.192 --> 24:22.709
Wimpro has three lines of credit
with three different banks.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.828
They have to give permission
when ownership changes.

24:25.830 --> 24:28.467
But it's a formality,
they must have forgotten.

24:28.469 --> 24:30.708
I'll call Leena,
they'll be at the office.

24:41.184 --> 24:43.421
Her phone's switched off, that's odd.

24:43.423 --> 24:45.580
I'll try Patrick.

24:45.582 --> 24:47.342
Put your shoes on.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.299
Patrick's is switched off, too...

24:56.618 --> 24:59.217
It'll be quicker to go in person.

25:50.678 --> 25:52.557
Be careful, Azzurra.

26:38.220 --> 26:40.857
I called Wimpro's headquarters.

26:40.859 --> 26:45.457
They don't know who we are,
they've never even heard of us.

26:47.537 --> 26:49.896
It was all fake.

26:51.695 --> 26:54.012
Gennaro, that's not possible.

26:54.014 --> 26:57.891
I've known Leena for 15 years,
she's always been legit.

26:57.893 --> 27:02.769
I checked her company:
the accounts, acquisitions, contracts.

27:02.771 --> 27:05.370
There has to be another explanation.

27:11.688 --> 27:14.684
There's shit everywhere,

27:14.686 --> 27:17.603
it just has different colors.

27:17.605 --> 27:19.245
There's your explanation.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.917
We have two advantages,

27:33.919 --> 27:39.315
the first is that they weren't
expecting us to find out so soon,

27:39.317 --> 27:43.516
the second is that I know more
than they think.

27:58.070 --> 28:01.547
Gennaro, I swear,

28:01.549 --> 28:04.188
I'm not involved.

28:14.544 --> 28:20.460
I know you're not,
but do me a favor.

28:20.462 --> 28:22.381
Whatever you want.

28:24.620 --> 28:30.138
From now on, just keep
that fucking mouth of yours shut.

28:33.177 --> 28:34.896
Let's go.

29:16.329 --> 29:18.071
- Hello.
- Hello.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.358
Hello, momma.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.204
I found the Grevillea.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.051
How are you to...

29:46.295 --> 29:47.607
Please don't hurt her.

29:52.627 --> 29:54.426
See, Ma'am? Leena's here.

29:55.800 --> 29:56.855
Please.

29:59.784 --> 30:02.863
Only I knew. I could feel it.

30:06.742 --> 30:09.421
That's why I had you followed
the other night.

30:14.419 --> 30:17.378
I've fucking had it with this game!

30:20.176 --> 30:22.613
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

30:24.478 --> 30:27.605
I'm sorry. I'm really...
I'm sorry.

30:30.093 --> 30:33.292
We're all so predictable, so petty.

30:38.570 --> 30:42.846
We all have someone important
we'd do anything for,

30:42.848 --> 30:45.167
even something really fucking stupid.

30:48.486 --> 30:51.885
I knew you couldn't leave without
saying goodbye to your mom.

30:54.324 --> 30:56.283
Right, Leena?

31:03.927 --> 31:05.489
Where is my gold?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.219
It's...

31:09.999 --> 31:11.436
in the warehouse.

31:13.094 --> 31:14.672
But I don't have a key.

31:17.784 --> 31:19.542
And where is the key?

31:21.028 --> 31:23.614
I don't have it. I don't have it.

31:25.864 --> 31:26.630
No?

31:27.174 --> 31:28.260
Patrick...

32:15.842 --> 32:16.865
Check there.

33:02.876 --> 33:04.875
What the fuck have you done?

33:08.274 --> 33:09.873
Is he dead?

33:11.073 --> 33:14.511
- Yes.
- I needed him alive, asshole!

33:19.190 --> 33:21.947
Go and see if anyone's coming.

33:21.949 --> 33:23.588
The piece.

33:47.429 --> 33:49.028
Motherfuckers...

33:50.587 --> 33:53.826
We gotta make him disappear.
Take the arms, hurry.

34:50.885 --> 34:52.924
Our gold is here.

34:59.841 --> 35:02.920
If we hadn't made it in time
tonight it was headed to Singapore.

35:40.626 --> 35:42.185
Come, Gaetano.

35:51.702 --> 35:53.821
See, there's a door.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.859
Is the gold there?

36:29.488 --> 36:33.646
Leena...
Love makes people act crazy.

36:34.886 --> 36:38.002
Now that I've found my gold,
I'm happier,

36:38.004 --> 36:40.681
so I'll give you another chance.

36:40.683 --> 36:42.963
Untie her.

37:10.552 --> 37:13.629
I came to London
because I had a problem

37:13.631 --> 37:16.308
and now you have to solve it for me

37:16.310 --> 37:18.827
unless you wanna end up
like your friend.

37:18.829 --> 37:22.026
You have 36 hours,
Gaetano will be your shadow.

37:22.028 --> 37:23.467
You understand?

37:26.586 --> 37:28.146
Alberto, come here.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.144
Come here!

37:41.581 --> 37:42.900
Translate.

37:45.779 --> 37:49.258
Come,
let's call them straightaway.

38:29.219 --> 38:30.633
Thank you.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.430
Thank you.

38:48.483 --> 38:49.960
Thank you so much.

39:07.908 --> 39:10.387
I really missed
our little lamb chop so much.

39:11.907 --> 39:14.504
I missed him, too.

39:14.506 --> 39:16.665
I really missed
being in my own home.

39:20.184 --> 39:25.022
But now we're back
and we have the company we needed.

39:32.099 --> 39:36.737
In the end, Alberto was right,
Leena was really useful.
