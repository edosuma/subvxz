WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.704
I had no idea
what I would find

00:03.737 --> 00:05.539
when I went searching
for my father.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.342
They flashed the Zodiac Killer,
and my heart stopped.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.079
He believes
he is the son of the Zodiac.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.520
Got a tremor outside.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.790
Anyone explain to me
why we built this lab

02:02.823 --> 02:06.660
on a historically established
tectonic fault-line?

02:06.694 --> 02:08.128
Imagine if the EMs failed

02:08.162 --> 02:10.498
and the whole structure
dropped to the ground.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.000
Fuck yeah.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.136
All this glass.
And us in it.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.807
Scary shit.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.577
Guess we're good.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.816
Katie wasn't scared, though.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.552
She didn't even lift her head.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.287
You know why she's not scared

02:33.321 --> 02:35.889
that the big quake
might come today?

02:36.924 --> 02:39.560
Because she already knows
it doesn't.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.997
I have a strong understanding

02:44.031 --> 02:45.733
of the magnetic fields
supporting us,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.201
our tolerances in an earthquake

02:47.235 --> 02:50.070
and our backup power systems.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.540
If you're feeling anxious,

02:52.573 --> 02:55.209
I can explain it to you.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.578
It's okay, Katie.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.112
I believe you.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.607
Boss is here.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.548
Is it morning already?

03:34.582 --> 03:35.916
This place is like Vegas--

03:35.949 --> 03:37.785
I never know what time it is.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.028
Hey.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.932
Hey.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.735
Did you sleep okay?

06:07.768 --> 06:09.269
I did.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.339
Eventually.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.874
Yeah, same.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.678
Thanks for
letting me stay, Jamie.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.113
Oh, come on.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.749
You couldn't go back last night.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.019
Not alone.
Not after what we saw.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.255
But still, thanks.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.763
And you didn't have
to let me take your bed.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.098
Or change your sheets.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.602
Well, you know.
Chivalry.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.242
And I kind of did need
to change the sheets.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.119
Is it wise...
to retread these steps?

07:00.187 --> 07:01.622
Or is it helpless?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.759
I don't need a lecture, Katie.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.464
What if someone else
had walked in instead of me?

07:10.498 --> 07:12.600
If the technicians
see you accessing the future

07:12.633 --> 07:15.302
it makes it seem as if the rule
is open to being broken.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.807
They know not to break the rule.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.511
And they know
we do break the rule.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.686
You still
shouldn't be watching this.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.855
It doesn't help.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.033
What were you doing?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.235
Checking that the tramlines
remain intact?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.173
Maybe.
I don't know.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.712
I'm just scared.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.214
Of what?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.552
Us.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.187
Me and you.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.160
Everything we do
is predicated on the idea

08:13.193 --> 08:15.563
that we live
in a physical universe.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.598
Not a magical universe.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.167
Are you doubting that?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.270
Not the physical universe.

08:25.906 --> 08:29.342
But I am scared
we might be magicians.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.179
What if...

08:32.212 --> 08:34.815
we project
one minute into the future.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.883
-Right now.
-Forest...

08:35.916 --> 08:37.017
What if, Katie.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.153
What if, one minute
into the future,

08:40.187 --> 08:42.389
we see you fold your arms.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.560
And you say,
"Fuck the future.

08:46.594 --> 08:50.097
"I'm a magician.
My magic breaks tramlines.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.765
I'm not going to fold my arms."

08:51.799 --> 08:54.167
You put your hands
in your pockets.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.604
And you keep them there
until the clock runs out.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.418
Cause precedes effect.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.554
Effect leads to cause.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.458
The future is fixed

09:18.491 --> 09:20.994
in exactly the same way
as the past.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.431
The tramlines are real.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.777
In 48 hours...

09:39.479 --> 09:40.848
...Lily will die.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.484
There's no magic.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.988
Effectively...

09:50.123 --> 09:51.625
...it's already happened.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.801
They're gonna kill me.

10:03.503 --> 10:07.074
It's a single phone call
to the police or the FBI.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.276
You're not thinking it through.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.278
They'll kill me.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.846
Not get angry,

10:12.880 --> 10:15.649
not threaten to sue.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.450
Kill me.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.152
Like they killed Sergei.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.821
Then we make it anonymous.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.956
We tell the cops
about the doctored film.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.826
Where to look. What to look for.
They do the rest.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.929
I think you need to stop
seeing them as a tech company.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.998
See them as the mob.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.501
You really want to call the cops
and inform on the mob?

10:34.534 --> 10:36.837
You feel confident
they can protect you?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.605
Yes, with witness protection.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.775
Living in fucking Iowa
for the rest of my days?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.210
Then what?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.478
You want to take them down,
yes, okay, fine,

10:45.512 --> 10:48.481
but you, Lily Chan,
computer engineer,

10:48.515 --> 10:50.483
can't take them down.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.686
Not alone.
It's impossible.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.822
Jamie, just...

10:54.855 --> 10:56.389
What?

10:56.423 --> 10:59.359
Just stop trying to fix this.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.395
Stop trying to know what to do.
Okay?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.431
Neither of us knows what to do.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.475
I'm gonna go back home.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.510
What?

11:17.544 --> 11:19.679
They'll be keeping tabs on me.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.082
I don't want anything
to look wrong.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.751
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.085
-Yes.
-No.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.154
I don't want them to know
you exist.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.388
That's my problem.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.857
Your problem.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.591
More chivalry?

11:31.624 --> 11:34.661
You realize this is a step up
from changing the sheets.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.096
Fuck, Lily, that...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.266
You know, for two years,

11:39.299 --> 11:41.869
I've been shadowed by
a thousand things about you.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.904
Your face in the morning.

11:43.937 --> 11:47.007
Stupid jokes we had,
names we had for each other.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.778
But I just remembered
what it was really like

11:50.811 --> 11:52.479
going out with you.

11:58.318 --> 12:01.922
I was thinking the same thing,
actually.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.760
I just want you to be safe.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.431
I know.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.101
I'd like us both to be safe.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.011
I'll check in
with you later, okay?

12:30.150 --> 12:33.253
Yeah.
Super fucking okay.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.077
Hey, brother.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.880
You got a smoke there, man?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.685
Ah.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.220
Right on.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.923
Thank you.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.326
Uh, you got a...
Yeah.

13:49.863 --> 13:53.066
I've been ringing that bell here
for Lily Chan.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.268
She lives here.
You know her?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.406
Yeah.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.275
You see her today?
Or last night?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.846
Don't worry.
I'm not the police.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.383
I know.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.419
Still worried, though.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.558
Lily and I work together.
I'm just here to pick her up.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.560
Oh.
Gotcha.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.030
I'm sorry, man, no offense.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.431
Uh...

14:24.464 --> 14:26.466
that's Lily's window,
right there.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.870
Yeah.
I think she left you a note.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.815
Not afraid of you, man.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
Yeah, I can see that.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.922
Just trying to figure out why.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.669
Thank you.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.810
Yo, Lily.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.846
Stranger danger.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.515
Shit.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.856
Hey.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.358
You got a problem,

16:31.391 --> 16:33.393
I got your back.
For real.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.064
Thanks.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.277
How are you, Lily?

16:51.678 --> 16:54.647
Feeling a little better
than yesterday.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.049
Thank you.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.819
That's great.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.321
You remember
we had an appointment

17:01.354 --> 17:03.356
to see a doctor this morning.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.893
Oh.
Right.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.764
So... one thing.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.500
Um...

17:13.533 --> 17:16.403
I think I'm not
ready for that yet.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.571
-No?
-No.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.774
It's like, I know how this goes,

17:21.808 --> 17:23.776
these episodes I have, and...

17:23.810 --> 17:27.414
I think it would be better
for me to just stay home.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.416
You're feeling stronger,

17:29.449 --> 17:31.118
-less delicate.
-Yeah.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.619
Exactly.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.054
That's good.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.556
Still, on balance, uh,

17:36.589 --> 17:38.358
I think you should
see a doctor.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.193
-I just know that...
-You had a panic attack

17:40.227 --> 17:41.694
in my office and stepped out

17:41.728 --> 17:44.231
onto a third-story
window ledge, Lily.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.633
I don't blame you for wanting
to pretend it didn't happen,

17:46.666 --> 17:48.168
but it did.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.238
See the doctor and we're done.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.559
Holy shit.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.666
So, Lily.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.235
Um, I'd like to go through
a few details

20:02.269 --> 20:04.537
before we get into
the specific reasons

20:04.571 --> 20:06.539
as to why you're here.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.207
Would that be okay?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.709
Yes.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.278
Thank you.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.112
Let's start with your age.

20:13.145 --> 20:16.082
-27.
-27.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.086
And have you had
any physical illnesses recently?

20:20.119 --> 20:21.588
No.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.055
No.
Very good.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.293
Are you on
any prescription medication?

20:26.326 --> 20:28.795
-No.
-Any recreational drug use--

20:28.828 --> 20:32.098
cannabis, cocaine,
MDMA, hallucinogens?

20:35.502 --> 20:37.404
Nothing for a while.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.139
How...
What are we calling "a while"?

20:40.172 --> 20:41.674
Years.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.877
Maybe three.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.580
Okay.
And which drugs, specifically?

20:49.181 --> 20:50.650
The ones you mentioned.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.952
All the ones I mentioned?

20:52.985 --> 20:54.954
Yeah.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.089
But, like I said,
nothing for a while.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.625
I understand.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.095
And is there any history
of mental illness

21:03.129 --> 21:04.631
in your family?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.602
No.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.405
Uh, this would include
aunts, uncles, grandparents.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.940
No.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.744
Tell me about your family.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.278
What about my family?

21:19.312 --> 21:22.214
Oh, parents professions,
upbringing.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.618
Right.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.623
My dad died when I was ten.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.124
Heart condition.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.661
He was an industrial engineer.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.031
My mother remarried
after he died.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.033
She moved to Hong Kong,

21:41.067 --> 21:43.503
had a second family.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.705
Mm.
Brothers? Sisters?

21:45.738 --> 21:48.240
No full brothers or sisters.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.044
From my point of view,
I'm an only child.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.548
Are you close to your mother?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.049
More or less.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.718
What does that mean?

22:00.186 --> 22:02.655
I don't know.
We act close.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.956
But?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.992
We're not close.

22:08.695 --> 22:11.864
I just think it's easier
for her to believe we're close

22:11.898 --> 22:14.634
than to realize we're not.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.136
not uncommon, I think.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.671
Yeah.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.447
How are you sleeping?

22:29.281 --> 22:30.850
Not well.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.720
Having trouble getting to sleep?
Waking during the night?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.221
Both.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.723
Appetite?

22:36.756 --> 22:38.458
Low.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.196
And if now we were to talk about

22:44.230 --> 22:46.332
the specific incident
that led you here--

22:46.365 --> 22:48.668
the incident at your workplace--

22:48.701 --> 22:50.703
how would you describe it?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.379
I can't.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.914
You can't describe it?

23:03.249 --> 23:04.917
I don't remember it.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.619
You remember nothing
about it at all?

23:06.653 --> 23:09.221
No.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.424
It's a total blank.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.793
Like it's erased from my memory.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.329
So I can't really
tell you anything.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.633
Well...

23:20.667 --> 23:23.436
what would you speculate
might have happened?

23:26.773 --> 23:28.240
I guess

23:28.274 --> 23:32.078
the death of my boyfriend
triggered...

23:32.111 --> 23:33.613
stuff.

23:34.647 --> 23:37.717
I've had episodes before.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.152
Like after my dad died.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.921
So maybe it's that.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.828
Or maybe it's a chemical
imbalance of some sort.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.903
Lily, anything
you say to me is bound

23:56.936 --> 23:59.939
by very strict terms of
patient-doctor confidentiality.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.508
You know that, don't you?

24:01.541 --> 24:03.476
Yes.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.578
So if I were to promise
that you can say

24:05.612 --> 24:07.647
whatever you like--

24:07.680 --> 24:11.150
under those
terms of confidentiality--

24:11.183 --> 24:13.953
what would you
want to talk about?

24:18.725 --> 24:21.494
Why don't you just say whatever
is coming into your head.

24:22.829 --> 24:23.863
-Yeah.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.332
No.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.200
Sorry.
I'll be there in 40 minutes.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.772
No, no,
it's just a family issue.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.541
Yeah, totally.
Okay.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.843
All right, see you.
Bye.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.300
Okay.

26:00.492 --> 26:01.994
Okay.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.134
We have a prediction system
based on ultra-massive data.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.136
The data goes
to a sub-atomic level,

26:10.169 --> 26:12.138
so we're fully in the world
of quantum mechanics

26:12.171 --> 26:14.273
using a fully deterministic
interpretation

26:14.306 --> 26:17.276
for which we use a version
of de Broglie-Bohm.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.778
Pilot-wave.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.279
And it works.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.648
Kind of.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.983
We glimpsed Christ on the cross.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.952
Exactly.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.954
We didn't see him or hear him.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.390
We glimpsed him
through a blizzard of variances.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.926
The boss doesn't like variances.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.595
The binary problem
in our quantum system.

26:36.629 --> 26:39.966
It either works totally
or not at all.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.269
-Right?
-Right.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.172
And particularly bad for me,

26:46.205 --> 26:47.640
'cause I'm focused
on soundwaves,

26:47.674 --> 26:49.008
which are mega fragile,

26:49.041 --> 26:51.678
and the variances
go wild mega fast.

26:51.711 --> 26:54.781
So most of my day,
I'm hearing shit like this.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.591
Inelegant.
Ugly.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.259
Drop-out.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.195
And it gets worse the further
we travel back in time

27:09.228 --> 27:11.764
and the worse is exponential.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.100
Hearing that shit through
my headphones all day--

27:14.133 --> 27:15.968
it drives me a little crazy,

27:16.002 --> 27:18.871
so I-I figure I need a break.
I get up.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.207
Just to clear
my head for a while.

27:21.240 --> 27:25.177
And I find myself
over at our core computer,

27:25.211 --> 27:28.614
thinking about how crazy
all this shit is.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.350
Entanglement, superpositions,

27:31.383 --> 27:33.452
all the voodoo.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.689
And I'm thinking,
fucking de Broglie-Bohm,

27:36.723 --> 27:39.692
fucking pilot-wave,
fucking hidden variables.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.728
I wish I could ditch them all.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.530
So I did.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.114
That's a projection?

28:02.782 --> 28:04.416
Yeah.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.918
It's fucking crystal.

28:05.952 --> 28:08.620
-What language is that?
-It's Aramaic.

28:10.289 --> 28:13.525
-From 2000 years ago.
-Whoa.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.129
That's Jesus talking?

28:19.465 --> 28:22.568
-Tell them what you fucking did.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.673
I switched out De Broglie-Bohm
for the Everett interpretation.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.275
Many-Worlds.

28:29.308 --> 28:30.877
Still deterministic.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.511
Deterministic because everything

28:32.544 --> 28:34.080
than can happen will happen.

28:34.113 --> 28:37.083
And that's as deterministic
as you can get.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.487
Cute, Lyndon.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.757
It's a cute party trick.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.692
A hell of a party.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.194
Glad I'm invited.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.297
No.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.299
It's a waste of time.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.334
And it's dangerous.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.370
Why is it dangerous?

28:58.404 --> 29:00.572
Because it's seductive.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.241
As I can see
from all your faces--

29:02.274 --> 29:04.543
lit up, hearing Jesus talk,

29:04.576 --> 29:06.445
getting nerd hard-ons.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.214
But let's all just be clear.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.683
It's not actually
Jesus talking, is it?

29:13.786 --> 29:15.221
No, it is Jesus talking.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.624
But not our Jesus,
from our history.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.493
It's a Jesus,
from a history.

29:21.527 --> 29:22.995
And every time
you run the system

29:23.029 --> 29:24.530
you'll get a different outcome.

29:26.532 --> 29:30.469
But the difference might be
a single hair on Jesus' head.

29:30.502 --> 29:33.672
No, it will be that difference.

29:33.705 --> 29:35.107
And three hairs difference.

29:35.141 --> 29:38.010
And four.
And a thousand.

29:38.044 --> 29:41.013
And all points in between
and either side.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.551
That's your response
to what I've just achieved?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.655
We're splitting hairs.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.657
No, Lyndon.

29:51.690 --> 29:54.126
This is my response.
You're fired.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.928
What?

29:55.962 --> 29:57.930
You're fired.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.132
You've undermined
everything I'm trying to do.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.069
-Katie.
-Forest.
-Shut up, Katie.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.538
Are you kidding me?

30:06.572 --> 30:09.008
I'm not kidding anyone.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.709
This is a message
to the whole team.

30:10.742 --> 30:12.879
If you didn't know it
with the Russian kid,

30:12.912 --> 30:14.881
you know it now.
I will not accept

30:14.914 --> 30:17.216
this project being undermined.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.221
Lyndon, you'll get
your Devs separation pay.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.956
Ten million dollars.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.792
And if you talk about your work
here to anyone,

30:26.825 --> 30:29.228
in any context,
at any time, I'll know.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.231
Now get your stuff and get out.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.720
All good?

30:54.753 --> 30:57.189
Yes.
Thank you.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.093
I'd like to go home now.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.761
Absolutely.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.763
Just need to get
the doctor's invoice.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.798
Take a seat
for a couple of minutes.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.381
Be quick.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.750
She's a highly intelligent
young woman.

31:24.783 --> 31:27.253
I'd say she was extremely upset
by the death of her boyfriend

31:27.286 --> 31:30.056
and she has various
relationship issues,

31:30.089 --> 31:31.557
but I wouldn't say
she's suffering

31:31.590 --> 31:34.793
from either schizophrenia
or psychosis.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.862
And I don't think she ever has.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.632
So she was lying.
It was all an act.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.668
You understand
I can't be 100% sure.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.005
But the probability is high.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.942
Sorry about that.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.944
Let's get you home.

31:55.081 --> 31:57.083
I don't know
what the fuck just happened.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.089
-My head is...
-Lyndon.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.427
I mean, I just fucking
fixed that guy's shit.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.830
His shit, I fucking fixed it.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.334
-And he fires me?
-Lyndon.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.806
-What?
-Go.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.278
-Go?
-Go.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.815
You're very young,

32:29.848 --> 32:31.817
you're very rich.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.485
Go.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.128
You mean
I never see this place again?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.635
Do I ever see you again?

32:53.739 --> 32:55.374
We don't even hang out?

32:55.407 --> 32:58.644
Lyndon, I want to know
that you were listening.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.182
I am listening.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.852
Not to me.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.855
I want to know
you were listening to him.

33:09.888 --> 33:11.390
To Forest.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.694
He said he'd kill you.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.229
He will.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.368
Now, this moment,

33:22.401 --> 33:23.902
go.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.861
Lily.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.598
I know everything.

35:02.501 --> 35:06.438
I had a conversation
with the psychiatrist.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.141
-What?
-Gave me a clear evaluation

35:09.175 --> 35:11.910
that you're highly paranoid
and delusional

35:11.943 --> 35:14.680
and suffering
from severe psychosis.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.915
My feeling
is you're a high suicide risk.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.584
And that puts
an obligation on me,

35:18.617 --> 35:21.119
as a representative
of your employer.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.121
-The duty of care.
-No.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.291
Lily, we both know
your mental state.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.326
And your history.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.463
This is not
the way to my apartment.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.532
We're not going
to your apartment.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.337
Stop the car.
Now.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.805
Can't do that.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.445
Stop the fucking car.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.879
I'm afraid not.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.452
Hey, wait...

36:28.220 --> 36:30.222
Hey, where you going?
Call an ambulance.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.592
Hey, buddy.

36:35.461 --> 36:36.895
Hey, buddy, you okay?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.165
-Shit.
-You okay, buddy?

36:40.198 --> 36:41.900
The girl-- where did she go?

36:42.934 --> 36:44.536
She...

36:44.570 --> 36:46.071
Hey, dude, you're bleeding.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.622
Fuck.

37:33.319 --> 37:35.954
You just fired
my most talented engineer.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.424
Did you already know
you were gonna do that?

37:38.457 --> 37:39.958
Did you?

37:41.827 --> 37:44.596
Lyndon introduced the multiverse
into Devs.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.165
He broke a rule
that isn't open to being broken.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.267
He used exceptionally
beautiful mathematics.

37:49.301 --> 37:52.638
To make near infinite variations
on our history.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.441
A version of our world

37:55.474 --> 37:57.509
where you're seated
an inch to the left

37:57.543 --> 37:59.511
or an inch to the right.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.112
Or the Pope converted to Islam

38:01.146 --> 38:04.082
or the moon landings
were achieved by Cambodia.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.818
-It works.
-It does not work!

38:11.156 --> 38:13.158
It does not work.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.328
If it's not our Jesus

38:16.362 --> 38:18.964
it's not my Amaya.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.500
And does every hair
on her head matter?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.870
Yes, it does.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.307
I broke a rule today too.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.842
Just now.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.813
I took Lyndon's
Many-Worlds algorithm

38:34.846 --> 38:36.348
for sound waves...

38:38.550 --> 38:40.552
...and I applied it
to light waves.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.371
Oh, Christ.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.477
Lily?

40:11.510 --> 40:13.512
What happened?

40:21.319 --> 40:23.321
911, what's your emergency?

40:23.354 --> 40:25.924
-I'm reporting a crime.
-What's the nature
of the crime?

40:25.957 --> 40:28.326
-Murder.
-The name of the person?

40:28.359 --> 40:30.128
Sergei Pavlov.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.231
P-A-V-L-O-V.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.968
-Right now?
-No. Five days ago.

40:37.002 --> 40:39.237
What's the address?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.573
Ma'am, are you still there?

40:41.607 --> 40:44.009
1303 Oak Hill Avenue,

40:44.042 --> 40:45.544
apartment 40.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.346
And what's your name?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.850
-Lily Chan.
-Spell it for me.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.652
C-H-A-N.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.120
Please stay on the line.
I'm gonna make a report.

40:55.153 --> 40:58.256
It... No. I'm not
gonna stay on the line.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.791
-Just send someone.
-No, no. Please don't...

41:10.301 --> 41:12.203
I was wrong.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.839
You were right.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.473
We need the police.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.343
They're here.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.350
Guess this is it.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.761
-Lily Chan?
-Yes.

42:09.795 --> 42:11.496
I'm arresting you for reckless
endangerment in the first degree

42:11.529 --> 42:13.264
while taking control
of a vehicle.

42:13.298 --> 42:14.900
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.935
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

42:16.968 --> 42:19.070
-in a court of law.
-Excuse me, Officer,
this is a mistake.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.607
You have a right to an attorney
before and after questioning,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.074
if not we will appoint one
for you.

42:23.108 --> 42:25.010
-Do you understand?
-No.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.511
-Suspect replied no.
-Yep.

42:26.544 --> 42:27.913
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back

42:27.946 --> 42:29.414
where I can see them.

42:29.447 --> 42:31.516
-What the fuck is going on?
-Okay, let's go.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.752
-No. You have to stop.
-Shh.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.386
You don't understand.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.956
Doctor.

42:37.989 --> 42:41.259
-Oh, my God.
-As state-designated clinician,

42:41.292 --> 42:44.195
do you confirm this is the
subject of the 51/50 H and S?

42:44.229 --> 42:46.197
-Yes.
-You can't do this.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.366
-This is her.
-On the grounds that
she is a danger to herself

42:48.399 --> 42:50.368
and a danger to others,
we turn her over

42:50.401 --> 42:52.103
to involuntary psychiatric hold.

42:52.137 --> 42:53.271
-Oh, God. No. No.
-Thank you.

42:53.304 --> 42:55.173
-Come on, let's go.
-Jamie!

42:58.810 --> 43:00.311
