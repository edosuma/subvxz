I'm sorry. That wasn't, uh...

19:35.926 --> 19:37.636
Oh. No. Why are you sorry?

19:38.262 --> 19:41.014
I don't know.
Um, I'm not, I guess?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.725
I didn't know that you
were back on the apps.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.769
Yeah. I was--
I mean, it's all very new, you know?

19:45.769 --> 19:47.604
I just figured it's been
a while since Meredith, so...

19:47.604 --> 19:48.856
Oh, totally.

19:49.982 --> 19:51.066
I think it's great.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.193
Cool. Thanks.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.071

- Yeah.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.322
Oh!

19:58.031 --> 19:59.324

19:59.324 --> 20:01.827

Sorry, guys. I'll do the honors

You're not even gonna try?

20:20.304 --> 20:22.556

without family...

20:25.058 --> 20:26.268
Is there more to that?

I was gonna say that we're your family,
