WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:07.311
And did you remember to
pack your toiletry bag?

00:07.355 --> 00:09.052
You don't want to buy
stuff at the hotel.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.314
It's expensive.Trust me,

00:10.358 --> 00:12.447
I know. Hotel lobby store prices

00:12.490 --> 00:14.275
make the minibar look
affordable.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.930
Feels really weird going
to my first pro tournament

00:17.974 --> 00:19.062
without you guys.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.846
I wish you were coming.I know, so do I.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.979
But we talked about it.
It would just make you nervous.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.459
I'm already nervous.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.808
My armpits look
like the fountain

00:25.851 --> 00:27.897
in front of the Bellagio.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.292
There's another show
starting in ten minutes

00:31.335 --> 00:33.120
if you want to get a good seat.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.817
I'll go with you.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.732
Uh, you have a math test today.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.603
And it would suck to miss it,

00:38.647 --> 00:40.127
but it feels like Dad needs me.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.954
Oh.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.044
That's so very heroic of you.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.306
Go get ready for school.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.829
Nice try, buddy.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.091
I was buying it.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.659
See you in a couple days.

00:50.702 --> 00:51.834
Good luck, Dad.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.096
Okay.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.489
Here's some snacks
for the car ride.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.533
Thanks, honey.Ooh.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.100
Maybe just a kiss?

00:57.144 --> 00:59.189
You weren't kidding
about those soaking pits.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.757
Here.Hug me, I'm damp!

01:01.800 --> 01:03.846
I'm damp!

01:05.021 --> 01:07.371
Knock, knock!
Oh, good, you're still here.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.765
I brought you
some snacks for the ride.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.860
Uh, thanks, Mom,
but Jen already made me snacks.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.905
What's that for,
the walk to the car?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.691
It's only a three-hour drive.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.085
What if they break down
or lose cell service?

01:25.128 --> 01:26.956
If all they have
is this little bag,

01:26.999 --> 01:29.045
Archie and Tom would have
to eat each other.

01:30.177 --> 01:33.136
Just know, if that happens,
I went down fighting, okay?

01:33.180 --> 01:35.182
I love you guys.
I got to go.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.748
Okay, I'll walk out with you.
I got to get

01:36.792 --> 01:38.489
my overnight bag
out of the car anyways.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.882
Wait, overnight?

01:39.925 --> 01:41.057
What are you
talking about?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.928
What is she talking about?

01:42.972 --> 01:44.495
Mom?

01:44.539 --> 01:46.671
What are you talking about?

01:46.715 --> 01:49.152
You don't think I'm
gonna leave Jen alone

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
while you're
gone, do you?

01:50.893 --> 01:52.329
She's gonna need
help with Sam.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.939
Oh, that's
such a nice offer, Helen,

01:53.983 --> 01:55.245
but I'm just gonna,
you know, take Sam

01:55.289 --> 01:56.551
to the salon with me
after school.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.292
Mm.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.209
Uh, you did say you were
gonna be overwhelm...

02:03.253 --> 02:05.037
Uh, Mom?

02:05.081 --> 02:06.648
Jen's got this covered.
She doesn't...

02:08.389 --> 02:09.433
I just-- I don't think...

02:13.089 --> 02:15.047
Okay, I'm gonna get
the hell out of here.

02:15.091 --> 02:17.137
Goodbye.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.314
I'm gonna eat your snacks first.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.447
Bye.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.536
Oh, good. Is this a turkey?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.985
I can't believe we're here.
This is incredible.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.770
That's Lefty Gomez.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.815
Mm-hmm.I love him-- Lefty!

02:43.859 --> 02:46.078
No! Would you get
your damn hand down?

02:46.949 --> 02:48.385
You want to act
like a groupie,

02:48.429 --> 02:49.647
then stand over there
with the rest of 'em.

02:49.691 --> 02:50.692
Right, right.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.172
Play it cool, play it cool.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.999
That's Strike Johnson.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.653
He's the last guy
to roll a 900 series.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.307
Like, 36 people have
ever done that.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.179
Do you think I
don't know that?

02:59.222 --> 03:00.832
But don't stare.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.183
Just side-eye the guy,

03:03.226 --> 03:05.402
like you're checking
out boobs in church.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.278
All right, listen,
remember.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.931
We're not here
to take selfies

03:12.975 --> 03:14.194
and make friends.
We're here to win.

03:14.237 --> 03:15.804
Got it. Boobs in church.

03:16.892 --> 03:19.024
Tom, you're a pro now.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.417
You're swimming
with sharks.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.853
These guys will do
whatever they can

03:21.897 --> 03:23.420
to get in your head
and destroy you.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.075
That's Rick Rholla.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.512
Rick Rholla, the Rock
'n' Roll Bowla-- I love him.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.558
You got to move,
you got to move.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.956
What's up?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.219
Hey.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.046
I'm Tom Smallwood.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.526
I'm a bowler, too.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.136
This is my coach Archie Betts.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.529
Uh, we're huge fans.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.270
I just got to say, your comeback

03:47.314 --> 03:49.098
at Cuyahoga Falls?

03:49.141 --> 03:51.622
Maybe the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life.Mm.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.058
I know I'm supposed to say
the birth of my son,

03:53.102 --> 03:55.147
but honestly
I was covering my eyes

03:55.191 --> 03:57.411
for most of that.
It was pretty...

03:57.454 --> 03:59.717
it was pretty gross.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.806
But a miracle.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.766
Uh-huh. I'll see
you on the lanes.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.376
Okay.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.073
You hear that?

04:08.117 --> 04:09.901
"See you on the lanes"?Come on.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.512
I haven't seen Jaws
in a little while,

04:11.555 --> 04:13.644
but I don't remember the
shark being that friendly.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.820
All I remember is,

04:15.864 --> 04:18.606
nobody listened to the sheriff
till it was too late.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
Hey.Hey.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.308
Hey, just give me ten minutes,
and I'll start dinner.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.267
Oh, don't worry about it.
Sam and I stopped

04:27.310 --> 04:28.964
and got waffles after school.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.313
W-Waffles?

04:30.357 --> 04:32.489
Well, waffle cones.
We had ice cream.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.623
You know, I wish
you would run that by me.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.102
I thought I just did.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.495
Wait...

04:38.539 --> 04:39.757
What happened here?

04:39.801 --> 04:41.542
Oh, I reorganized your fridge.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.457
When you open it up, your eyes
should just go directly

04:43.500 --> 04:45.154
to the items you use most.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.982
Yours was
all mixed up.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.418
Wow.

04:48.462 --> 04:49.680
It's amazing
we haven't starved to death.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.726
I was thinking
the same thing.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.947
What are you doing
to the cupboards?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.688
Oh, I fixed these, too.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.125
It was almost as big a disaster
as your refrigerator.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.041
It goes cups, bowls, plates.
Not the other way around.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.043
This ain't Europe.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.046
Yeah, this also isn't,
uh, your house.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.439
I liked it the way it was.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.006
Well, I'm just trying to help.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.182
And I'm just trying
to set some boundaries.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.967
Whoa, no need to
get all snippety.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.318
Wasn't trying to lift
my leg on your hydrant.

05:18.361 --> 05:20.624
Okay... look.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.018
Okay, I had
a stressful day at work.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.933
Ruth was riding me
the whole time.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.021
Oh, Ruth.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.762
She's all bark
and no bite.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.459
She always has been.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.808
Well, she says
I can't do anything right,

05:30.852 --> 05:31.896
and now I come home
and youtell me

05:31.940 --> 05:33.333
I can't do anything right.

05:34.508 --> 05:37.380
Well, say no more,
Zsa Zsa Gabor.

05:39.034 --> 05:41.166
I'll put everything back.
No.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.646
Just leave it.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.909
Good, it's better this way.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.217
I'm gonna go check on Sam.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.392
Make sure that history book

05:49.436 --> 05:51.263
got the Revolutionary War
right.

05:52.395 --> 05:54.179
Well, you were there.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.224
I heard that!

06:03.667 --> 06:05.408
Hey, Tom?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.801
Tom, listen.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.759
You got to remember
these lanes are

06:08.803 --> 06:10.457
faster than what you're used to.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.415
They are cruel and unforgiving,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.938
like yoga pants.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.854
Look, I took
a big swing one Christmas.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.378
You don't have to wear 'em.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.032
That's Rick.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.860
Rick Rholla. Hold on. Sorry.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.035
Uh, Rick?

06:24.079 --> 06:25.254
Hey, hey, man.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.604
Uh, just want to say
good luck today.

06:27.648 --> 06:28.605
What was that?

06:28.649 --> 06:30.215
Nothing, I'm just...

06:30.259 --> 06:32.261
I'm wishing
you good luck.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.132
You hear that?

06:34.176 --> 06:36.221
This clown is wishing
Rick Rholla luck.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.399
Yeah, I-I get it.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.791
Hazing the new guy, it's...

06:40.835 --> 06:43.054
You're not the new guy.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.882
You're the weird friendly guy

06:44.926 --> 06:46.754
who's about to get
his ass handed to him

06:46.797 --> 06:48.712
and then disappear
back to wherever

06:48.756 --> 06:50.975
weird friendly
guys come from.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.108
Probably Nebraska.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.241
Excuse me?

06:56.285 --> 06:58.418
"Excuse me"?

06:58.461 --> 06:59.854
Is that all you got
for a comeback?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.246
Buddy, you're not gonna last
ten frames here,

07:01.290 --> 07:02.552
but...

07:02.596 --> 07:03.640
"good luck."

07:04.511 --> 07:05.555
Let's roll, guys.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.991
I don't sound like that.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.257
That-that was crazy.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.434
I told you
these guys don't mess around.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.218
You see that dude with him?

07:16.261 --> 07:18.220
I heard he left
a horse's head

07:18.263 --> 07:19.787
in somebody's bed.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.571
I'm pretty sure that's

07:21.615 --> 07:22.833
The Godfather.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.227
What, so two people can't do it?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.495
Okay, Tom's tournament
is about to start.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.975
Fingers crossed he wins.Yeah.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.064
Winning would be so great,
but he just needs

07:36.107 --> 07:38.370
to finish in the top 30
to bring home some money.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.809
Jen, a second?

07:42.897 --> 07:45.116
Yeah?
After work
I'm gonna need you

07:45.160 --> 07:47.379
to drive to the warehouse
to pick up conditioner.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.947
Someone's been giving out
full squirts.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.949
That's a 45-minute drive.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.603
That I'm happy to do.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.649
Good. By the way,

07:55.692 --> 07:57.694
you're a walking advertisement
for the salon.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.305
Keep that in mind when you leave
the house in the morning.

08:00.349 --> 08:01.306
What's that supposed to mean?

08:01.350 --> 08:03.265
It means...

08:03.308 --> 08:05.789
imagine a client walking in

08:05.833 --> 08:07.182
like that.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.532
How would you fix it?

08:13.144 --> 08:15.407
Full...

08:15.451 --> 08:17.497
squirts.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.069
Feel like that could've
gone better.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.944
Well, it sure as hell
couldn't have gone any worse.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.121
You bowl like that tomorrow,

08:33.164 --> 08:34.862
and about the only thing
we're gonna be bringing home

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
is the free bible
out of the top drawer.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.477
What am I supposed to do, Arch?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.610
Rick Rholla was riding
my ass all day.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.541
Hey, Smallwood, do you

09:01.584 --> 09:03.673
inhale or exhale
on your approach?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.240
Never mind.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.633
Don't think about that now.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.468
I don't know.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.867
Well, you need
to toughen up.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.782
You want to compete
with these guys,

09:25.826 --> 09:28.132
you better learn to tap
into your killer instinct.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.570
I don't know
if I have a killer instinct.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.484
One time,
Jen stepped on a spider.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.486
Me and Sam had a funeral for it.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.967
I know, Tom.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.317
I've been to a few
of your bug burials.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.582
Hell, you're a nice guy.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.322
Thanks, man...That wasn't a compliment!

09:45.541 --> 09:47.499
Nice don't work
if you want to win.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.066
Maybe we'll get lucky.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.633
I won't be bowling
anywhere near him tomorrow.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
Well, just in case,
we need to be prepared.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.376
What do you mean?
What... what are you doing?

09:54.419 --> 09:56.987
Something I know
you wouldn't do-- getting ammo.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.989
We need to find
this guy's weaknesses

09:59.033 --> 10:00.600
and go after 'em.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.124
Ah, he dropped out of college.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.255
Filed for bankruptcy.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.779
Can't own a dog.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.259
I'm not sure what that's about.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.828
I hope that's an allergy thing.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.788
Boom! We got him.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.441
Apparently he's going

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
through a nasty divorce.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.010
Oh, I don't know, Archie.Hey!

10:20.054 --> 10:22.752
The only thing worse
than a horse's head in your bed

10:22.796 --> 10:24.624
is that empty space

10:24.667 --> 10:26.887
where your wife used to sleep.

10:33.154 --> 10:35.635
Looks like we're
lane neighbors again, Smallwood.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
Looks like we are.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.683
And unlike my real neighbor,
I will not say good morning.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.207
Or take in your garbage cans.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.950
I'm coming for you today, Rick!

10:46.994 --> 10:47.951
Not if I come for you first.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.039
Well, joke's on you.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.606
'Cause guess who gets up
pretty early

10:50.650 --> 10:52.695
in the morning--
what am I doing?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.088
You know what you got to do.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.525
Right, absolutely.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.926
Not bad.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.449
That was a real sneeze.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.017
The air filtration in here
is terrible.

11:12.410 --> 11:14.761
Hey.
Hey.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.110
What are you doing here?

11:16.153 --> 11:17.589
Oh, well,
I had a little time to kill

11:17.633 --> 11:19.591
before I picked up Sam
at his tap lesson.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.681
Mm-hmm.And I had a foot-long earlier.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.552
I could only stomach six inches.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.162
I figured you'd like the rest.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.817
Thanks.Mm.

11:29.210 --> 11:31.691
Whew, that's
a lot of onions.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.302
Yeah, anything they don't
charge you for, I get extra.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.522
This other bag is full
of napkins and forks.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.961
Helen.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.006
Ruth.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.182
Nice catching up.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.272
I'm going to lunch.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.318
You got that conditioner
I asked for, right?

11:50.361 --> 11:52.146
You bet I did.Good.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.452
And don't forget to clock out
when you eat that sandwich.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.803
I don't want you
chewing on my time.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.807
Dang it.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.156
Aw, don't worry,
it's not gonna take you long.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.461
I've seen you eat.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.115
Oh. No.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.335
I left the conditioner at home.
Ruth is gonna

12:07.378 --> 12:08.684
blow a gasket.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.686
Hey, relax. It's not
that big a deal.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.557
Everything is
a big deal with her.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.472
She called me last night
at midnight to ask

12:14.516 --> 12:16.823
why there was a Canadian quarter
in the register.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.389
Hey, you need to buck up.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.522
This job is a cakewalk.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.307
I had to install bumpers
on F-150s

12:23.351 --> 12:25.657
for 30 years with a bad back
and a small bladder.

12:25.701 --> 12:26.963
Oh, yeah.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.791
Yeah, you're right,
you're right.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.880
I'm sitting with a great job
and a regular-size bladder.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.490
What do I have
to complain about?

12:32.534 --> 12:34.144
That's right,
if you want the truth,

12:34.188 --> 12:35.972
I'm your gal.
If you want smoke up your butt,

12:36.016 --> 12:37.713
sit on a campfire.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.331
What the hell is
the matter with you?

12:47.375 --> 12:48.898
Rick is over there
eating you up,

12:48.942 --> 12:51.161
and you're just laying here,
passing him the salt.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.554
What am I supposed to do, Arch?

12:52.597 --> 12:54.991
Fight back. Get in his head.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.732
Say something
about his mama.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.342
I mean, at the very least,

12:58.386 --> 12:59.822
you could sneeze again, man.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.041
Damn.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.826
I can't.

13:03.870 --> 13:04.914
I took a Zyrtec.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.831
I don't want
to play dirty, okay?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.267
I thought you wanted this.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.182
I do want this.Then what's the issue?

13:12.226 --> 13:14.184
I don't want to be that guy.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.708
When I was ten,
I was already six-foot-two

13:16.752 --> 13:18.362
and my head was
the size it is now.

13:18.406 --> 13:20.321
I looked like a Blow Pop.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.715
I was an easy target.
Kids would make fun of me.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.935
And, sure, every once
in a while, I'd fight back.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.763
It felt good in the moment,

13:27.807 --> 13:30.200
but I always felt
like crap afterwards.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.898
I get it.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.248
I know, this is my job now.
I got to be competitive.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.206
But no job is worth me...

13:36.250 --> 13:37.642
You're up, Smallwood.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.514
Just get this over with,

13:39.557 --> 13:41.342
so you can go back
to your family empty-handed

13:41.385 --> 13:43.779
and everyone can forget
you ever existed.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.476
Like I just did.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.176
Hey, what is your problem?

13:49.219 --> 13:50.525
Oh!

13:50.568 --> 13:52.048
You a tough guy now?

13:52.092 --> 13:54.616
No, I'm genuinely asking,
what is your problem?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.358
Why are you so angry?

13:57.401 --> 13:59.229
Is this about... your divorce?

13:59.273 --> 14:00.927
What the hell did you just say?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.754
Your wife left you.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.800
I'd probably be
lashing out, too.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.758
Wait, what's happening here?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.241
If you're going through
something right now,

14:11.285 --> 14:13.156
having a hard time,

14:13.200 --> 14:15.202
just know I'm here
if you want to talk.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.769
Okay? All right.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.076
I got to bowl, champ.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.125
Is he for real?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.735
I'm afraid so.

14:26.778 --> 14:29.390
He's sweet on the outside,
soft in the middle.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
He is a Blow Pop.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.569
A six-foot-five,

14:34.612 --> 14:36.484
spider-loving Blow Pop.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.575
Okay, I'll be back
to check in on you

14:40.618 --> 14:42.403
in 20 minutes. Oh!

14:42.446 --> 14:44.057
There is a whole spread in there

14:44.100 --> 14:45.928
of a shirtless Idris Elba.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.582
If that doesn't do it for you,
there's also an article

14:47.625 --> 14:49.671
on five ways
to make a squash less boring.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.331
Knock yourself out
with the squash.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.597
I'm back.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.599
I hope it's not
more onion sandwiches.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.340
I'm still sweating out
the last one.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.691
You're married. What do
you need to smell good for?

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
I brought you the conditioner
that you forgot at home.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.786
That was very thoughtful.
Thank you.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.092
Oh, it's not a big deal.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.920
I wanted to swing
by the burger place.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.443
They're having a special.

15:22.486 --> 15:25.359
Buy one soda and get
77 straws for free.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.275
You're on the clock.

15:28.318 --> 15:29.624
A little less chitchat,
a little more chop-chop.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.625
Right, I'm sorry, Ruth.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.192
You don't need to apologize.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.281
We've been talking
for two seconds.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.153
Hey, why don't you
relax... Mussolini?

15:38.328 --> 15:39.634
What?

15:39.677 --> 15:41.592
Oh, nothing.
She calls everyone that.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.855
It's like "buddy" or "pal."

15:43.899 --> 15:46.902
Look, Jen.
My rules are very simple,

15:46.946 --> 15:48.991
but for some reason
they're too hard

15:49.035 --> 15:50.471
for you to understand.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.168
Don't take that tone with her.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.040
Excuse me?You heard me.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.171
Helen, it's okay, I...

15:55.215 --> 15:56.303
This is...
Stay out of this.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.827
Yeah, Jen can be annoying.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.698
Sometimes she does
things the wrong way.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.310
The mess in her
car trunk is insane.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.225
But...

16:05.268 --> 16:07.009
you can't talk to her like that.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.793
And you can?Yeah, I can.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.970
Because I'm her family.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.928
Jen is a good woman.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.843
She works her butt off,

16:14.886 --> 16:16.758
she's loyal as
the day is long.

16:16.801 --> 16:19.717
You are so lucky to have her.Oh!

16:19.761 --> 16:21.545
I'm lucky to have her?Yeah.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.243
Look, ladies, let's just...

16:23.286 --> 16:25.854
I have an employee
who begs me for extra shifts,

16:25.897 --> 16:28.726
then complains when I ask
her to close every night,

16:28.770 --> 16:31.555
and thinks I should give her
a raise just for doing her job.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.557
I'm so lucky.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.037
Thank you, Jen,

16:35.081 --> 16:36.778
for giving me
that privilege.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.388
Okay, you don't have
to put up with this crap.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.042
She quits.What are you doing?!

16:40.086 --> 16:41.609
Yeah, she quits.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.350
Oh, she quits, does she?No, no, no, no, no, she...

16:43.393 --> 16:45.352
She quits.No, no, she does not.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.180
She does not quit.
She needs this job

16:47.223 --> 16:49.399
very badly, and she knows
that you're a very kind

16:49.443 --> 16:52.098
and forgiving Christian woman.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.713
I have known some people with
sticks up their cabooses,

16:58.756 --> 17:02.717
but that lady is
straddling a sequoia.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.547
Helen...
I know!

17:06.590 --> 17:08.549
I shouldn't have
got you fired.

17:08.592 --> 17:11.204
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have opened my big mouth.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.293
I just couldn't stand the
way she was talking to you.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.643
You deserve so much...

17:30.136 --> 17:31.920
You're screwed, aren't you?

17:33.356 --> 17:34.966
Totally.

17:35.010 --> 17:36.098
Okay.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.795
I got you.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.018
It's hard to notice

17:43.062 --> 17:45.281
someone falling
out of love with you.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.068
Because it doesn't happen
all at once.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.592
I don't know what hurts more--
the fact that she's gone

17:51.635 --> 17:53.246
or...

17:53.289 --> 17:55.161
the fact
that I didn't see it coming.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.427
Believe me, man, I-I get it.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.645
Yeah?

18:01.689 --> 18:03.169
Your wife leave you, too?

18:03.212 --> 18:05.127
Oh, no.
She's my biggest supporter.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.956
We're madly in love, but...

18:07.999 --> 18:11.002
I should've said "I hear you"
rather than "I get it."

18:13.004 --> 18:14.963
But, Rick, you're gonna be okay.

18:15.006 --> 18:17.139
Thanks.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.881
There's not a lot of guys
like you on the tour, Smallwood.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.231
I'll take that as a compliment.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.757
And next time

18:26.801 --> 18:29.151
it's gonna be me bringing
home the big trophy.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.762
At least one that doesn't
look like a Monopoly piece.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.417
I'll see you around, Tom.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.639
All right,
you ready to hit the road,

18:38.682 --> 18:40.423
or you want to stick around,
listen to Lefty Gomez

18:40.467 --> 18:42.643
talk about his chocoholism?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.993
He's eating his feelings.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.429
Anybody can see that.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.041
Well, you finished in the money
in your first tournament.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.174
That's something a lot of pros
on the tour never did.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.002
I guess
I was wrong.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.265
Nice guys don't
always finish last.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.268
You know, when I was a kid,

18:59.312 --> 19:01.357
there was this guy,
always used to tell me,

19:01.401 --> 19:03.098
"Rise above the noise.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.709
Don't listen to the boys."
Smart guy.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.016
His name was Archie.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.931
Mm-hmm.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.672
Talking about you.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.761
I know!

19:14.979 --> 19:16.329
I also said if you shake it

19:16.372 --> 19:18.200
more than twice,
you're playing with it.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.465
You don't have to remember
everything I say.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.206
Come on.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.209
Hey, Coach, I want
you to have this.
Hmm?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.342
I wouldn't have won it
if it weren't for you.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.605
Nah, you keep it.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.346
I'll wait for the one
that doesn't look

19:33.389 --> 19:35.522
like you snapped it
off the hood of a car.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.400
Oh.

19:45.793 --> 19:47.534
Well?

19:47.577 --> 19:48.622
How'd it go?

19:48.665 --> 19:50.667
Obviously I didn't want to...

19:50.711 --> 19:52.843
tell you over the phone.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.630
I just thought it was important
to tell you face-to-face,

19:56.673 --> 19:59.241
I only, uh...

19:59.285 --> 20:01.461
came in 26th!

20:01.504 --> 20:02.984
26th?!

20:05.421 --> 20:07.031
What?

20:07.075 --> 20:08.381
That's in the money!I know!

20:08.424 --> 20:10.600
Oh, my God!

20:10.644 --> 20:12.254
There are only

20:12.298 --> 20:14.604
25 wives happier
than you right now.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.390
24 if we don't count
Rick Rholla's.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.521
Who?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.175
Who cares?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.264
Check it out.
What? What?

20:22.308 --> 20:24.266
They gave me money to bowl.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.920
What? Give me that!

20:25.963 --> 20:27.791
Oh, my gosh, this is
gonna come in handy.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.489
Really handy.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.578
What do you mean?Oh, don't you
worry about it.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.884
Now, okay, why don't
we go upstairs...
Oh.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.582
and celebrate

20:35.625 --> 20:37.453
your big win.

20:37.497 --> 20:38.454
Mmm.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.282
The wins keep coming.

20:42.632 --> 20:45.113
Hmm, come on.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.681
Ah, you know?Huh?

20:47.724 --> 20:50.640
For the first time, this feels
like maybe it's gonna work out.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.295
Knock, knock.
Welcome home, Tommy.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.254
I'm sorry
I got your wife canned.
