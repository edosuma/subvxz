01:07.260 --> 01:11.663
Whippoorwill flies about
27 miles an hour.

01:16.703 --> 01:19.069
That what you thought
it would have been?

01:25.745 --> 01:27.736
I'd have thought more like

01:29.582 --> 01:31.573
31 or something.

01:36.422 --> 01:37.822
32.

01:43.363 --> 01:45.354
Goddamn, that's a pisser.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.164
Normally, I could
look at anything,

01:49.235 --> 01:52.762
tell you exactly
how fast it's going
within 2 miles per hour.

01:52.839 --> 01:54.500
That's fascinating.

01:57.377 --> 01:58.810
I'm gonna...

03:06.713 --> 03:09.648
Get the fuck out of the way,
cocksucker!

03:13.753 --> 03:15.312
Morning, Mayor.

03:17.557 --> 03:19.457
Hi. How you all doing?

03:24.964 --> 03:26.864
Easy come, easy go.

03:33.873 --> 03:36.137
When Darwin said "fittest,"

03:36.375 --> 03:39.573
he didn't necessarily mean
the strongest,

03:39.645 --> 03:42.342
or the most intelligent,
or any one trait.

03:42.415 --> 03:46.682
He merely meant those
organisms most well-suited
to their environments.

03:46.919 --> 03:49.320
Now, we humans,

03:50.123 --> 03:54.924
we think we're more fit,
more evolved,
because we're smarter.

03:55.128 --> 03:56.755
But we're neophytes.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.897
We've only been on this Earth
two million years,
give or take.

03:59.966 --> 04:04.665
The cockroach, that fellow's
been around 350 million years.

04:05.505 --> 04:09.566
So, based on that,
which of us is
the more successful species?

04:12.478 --> 04:15.380
A lot of folks build houses
on unsafe ground.

04:15.448 --> 04:17.849
The erosion in Cambodia
is some of the worst.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.442
My friends wanted to
buy a house there, but...

04:19.519 --> 04:20.611
Hey. Come on.

04:20.685 --> 04:21.779
Hey, Grant.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.686
Okay.
Later, Hank.

04:25.658 --> 04:27.023
He's teaching
environmental studies.

04:27.093 --> 04:28.856
He's gonna borrow
one of my lesson plans.

04:28.928 --> 04:32.193
Oh, I know what he
wants to borrow,
and I ain't lending.

04:32.265 --> 04:34.995
Come on, you little varmint.
Cassidy, come.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.467
That's it.
Hey, can Cassie come over?

04:36.536 --> 04:38.504
Did she say she was
gonna be here?
Quit your lollygagging.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.198
Hi, sweetie.
See you guys later.

04:40.273 --> 04:41.262
Come on!
That's it.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.865
Here, sweetie.
You have
a good day today?

04:42.942 --> 04:45.104
Very nice.
Hop on in there, baby.

04:45.178 --> 04:47.578
Baby, when did you
go to Jack in the Box?

04:48.447 --> 04:50.416
That's one match
I'll never get.

04:51.184 --> 04:52.617
Ain't no mystery.

04:52.685 --> 04:55.655
Starla's raised in them
shanties off St. Luc.
Dirt poor.

04:55.721 --> 04:57.815
All she ever wanted was
to be a lady.

04:57.890 --> 05:00.223
Old Grant Grant, he's
always been made of green.

05:00.293 --> 05:02.557
Gold digger, huh?
Oh, hell, Margaret.

05:02.628 --> 05:04.892
Starla's mother left her.
Her daddy's a drunk.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.227
She's 17 years old.

05:06.299 --> 05:10.258
Old Grant pulls up,
big old Cadillac. House on
the hill and college tuition.

05:10.336 --> 05:11.360
What would you do?

05:11.437 --> 05:13.098
Blow.
Hell, if he had a 'gina,

05:13.172 --> 05:15.698
you'd have married him, too.
What's a 'gina?

05:16.976 --> 05:18.341
It's a country.

05:18.411 --> 05:20.743
You know,
where Ginese people come from.

05:20.813 --> 05:22.213
Learn to eavesdrop better.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.079
Zach. Hell, your mother's
waiting over there.

05:24.150 --> 05:26.016
What the hell you doing here?
Scoot, scoot.

05:27.220 --> 05:29.484
Sugarplum,
you coming to bed?

05:29.555 --> 05:32.218
...why the crocodile has
survived for millennia,

05:32.291 --> 05:35.454
when so many similar species
have gone extinct.

05:50.009 --> 05:51.306
Oh, yeah.

05:59.352 --> 06:00.842
You know what, baby?

06:03.322 --> 06:05.313
I'm just not
really in the mood.

06:05.424 --> 06:09.156
Come on, baby doll.
It's been a long time.
We both need it.

06:09.629 --> 06:11.221
I know. I'm just...

06:15.401 --> 06:18.302
Baby, come on now.
I don't just have some switch.

06:20.139 --> 06:21.539
Sure you do.

06:22.842 --> 06:24.071
Flick, flick.

06:26.946 --> 06:30.473
That's disrespectful.
Come on now.
I'm just playing with you.

06:31.117 --> 06:33.347
Come on, honey.
No, come on, baby.

06:33.519 --> 06:36.580
Why don't you just,
you know, work one out for
yourself there, darling?

06:36.656 --> 06:37.918
Come on.

06:39.158 --> 06:42.287
Honey, I'm just not
in the mood. Can't you tell?

06:44.163 --> 06:46.632
When the hell are you
in the mood anyway?

06:50.336 --> 06:51.462
Dang.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.011
Where you going?

07:03.249 --> 07:05.775
Out. For a walk.

07:06.986 --> 07:09.011
Grant. Baby.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.082
I...

07:37.950 --> 07:39.941
Yeah.
Hit me again there, killer.

08:01.674 --> 08:04.109
Megan Montgomery's
little sister.

08:04.677 --> 08:06.873
You're kidding me.
Nope.

08:07.646 --> 08:08.875
Brenda.

08:11.083 --> 08:14.383
My sister, Megan,
she was a big fat old cow,
and I'd be thinking,

08:14.453 --> 08:16.752
"What does he see in her
that ain't in me?"

08:16.822 --> 08:18.586
Shit, come on now.

08:19.191 --> 08:22.889
You couldn't have been
more than 10 or 11.
Hell, I was game.

08:28.701 --> 08:31.033
I'll give you
a ride, then.
All right, come on.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.900
Yee-haw! Giddyup.

08:39.879 --> 08:41.847
Come on.
Where we going, girl?

08:41.914 --> 08:42.938
Come on, you.
Where we going?

08:43.015 --> 08:44.278
Get over here.

08:46.952 --> 08:48.386
What'd I tell you?

08:49.288 --> 08:51.120
I had a crush on you.

08:51.624 --> 08:55.117
Will you look at that?
Your initials, "B.M."

08:57.296 --> 08:59.594
Like a piece of shit.
Oh, shut up.

08:59.765 --> 09:01.927
At least I don't got
the same last name
as the first.

09:02.001 --> 09:04.868
Oh, you're nothing
but a little turd, girl.
Oh, stop!

09:04.937 --> 09:06.769
Stop, yourself.
Stop.

09:18.884 --> 09:20.477
Wait. Wait, wait.

09:21.187 --> 09:23.621
Oh, Grant.
Oh, God. You gotta stop.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.815
I can't.

09:26.692 --> 09:27.989
Starla.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.594
She gets real worried about me
if I'm out too late.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.793
I'm sorry. I gotta go. I...

09:38.437 --> 09:41.373
Starla.
Yeah, shit. Go.

09:49.081 --> 09:50.173
What is it?

09:52.451 --> 09:53.942
I don't know.

10:01.861 --> 10:03.294
There's a trail.

10:22.014 --> 10:24.073
Oh. Oh, that's gross.

10:26.051 --> 10:27.917
Come on.
Oh...

10:27.987 --> 10:29.545
Come on. Grant.

10:29.855 --> 10:31.983
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:41.367 --> 10:42.891
What the fuck?

10:44.336 --> 10:46.066
God dog it!

10:52.611 --> 10:54.773
Oh, God.

10:55.981 --> 10:57.972
Grant.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.525
Grant?

11:16.168 --> 11:17.363
Grant.

11:21.307 --> 11:22.501
Grant.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.648
Grant, are you okay?

11:45.064 --> 11:46.224
Grant.

11:55.307 --> 11:56.604
You okay?

12:16.028 --> 12:17.154
Meat.

13:25.331 --> 13:26.855
Good morning, baby.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.330
We haven't heard
this song for a while.

13:31.070 --> 13:35.006
I was hoping it could be
a peace pipe.

13:47.519 --> 13:49.749
I'm sorry about last night.

13:55.561 --> 13:57.791
I don't mean
to push you away.

14:00.399 --> 14:02.458
Or make you feel rejected.

14:09.408 --> 14:11.536
I do want to be a good wife.

14:20.219 --> 14:21.743
You're crying.

14:23.756 --> 14:25.087
Baby.

14:48.714 --> 14:50.477
Baby, what's this?

14:54.386 --> 14:56.218
It's just a little bug bite.

15:18.811 --> 15:21.041
What are you so smiley about?

15:21.480 --> 15:22.743
Nothing.

15:23.916 --> 15:25.850
Grant and I had
a good morning.

15:25.918 --> 15:27.511
And it's been a while.

15:28.086 --> 15:30.248
Oh, you slut.

15:30.322 --> 15:31.687
Janene.

15:31.757 --> 15:33.748
Quiet.

15:33.826 --> 15:35.760
You're a married woman.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.129
It's Grant.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.230
I don't know, he's like...

15:41.800 --> 15:44.827
It was like he was discovering
all these different parts
of my body.

15:44.903 --> 15:47.770
You know,
like a little boy
or something.

15:47.873 --> 15:51.605
I'm telling you, this morning
I sensed a real change
in Grant.

15:58.283 --> 15:59.410
Meat.

16:00.385 --> 16:01.444
Meat. Meat.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.353
Howdy, Mr. Grant.
Oh, hey there, killer.

16:04.656 --> 16:07.717
What can I do you for?
Give me
a couple of your rib eyes.

16:07.793 --> 16:09.852
How many you need?
Eight.

16:10.796 --> 16:12.491
Know what? 10.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.826
No, no, no. You know what?

16:18.170 --> 16:19.330
Give me 14.

16:19.404 --> 16:20.929
Having a party?

16:21.573 --> 16:23.701
Yeah, yeah,
something like that. Yeah.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.370
It's a little surprise
for the wife.

16:41.159 --> 16:44.061
Grant. What's this lock
doing on the door?

16:44.796 --> 16:48.062
Baby, you drilled right into
the frame. It's all busted up.

16:53.372 --> 16:57.035
Sugarplum, you really think
you should be asking
so many questions

16:57.109 --> 16:58.599
when it's so close
to your birthday?

16:58.677 --> 17:00.543
My birthday's
not for two months.

17:00.612 --> 17:02.774
That's close.
Not really.

17:02.848 --> 17:04.542
Matter of opinion.

17:42.921 --> 17:47.120
Grant, I'm jumping in
the shower. Baby, we need to
leave in 40 minutes.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.607
What are you doing?

19:15.680 --> 19:17.376
Nothing. I gotta...

19:17.449 --> 19:20.009
I gotta go to work.
I left something at work.

19:20.085 --> 19:24.352
What? Grant, Deer Cheer starts
in about an hour,
and you promised me.

19:24.423 --> 19:27.483
Gotta go! Gotta go to work.
I'll meet you there!

19:46.812 --> 19:50.214
I will never understand
what joy a grown man gets

19:50.282 --> 19:53.149
using a $1,000 weapon
to blow the face off
a cute little deer.

19:53.218 --> 19:54.344
Yeah.

20:00.392 --> 20:04.055
Surprised you're able to lift
a mug, you've been carrying
that torch for so long.

20:04.129 --> 20:06.723
Oh, that reminds me
of something I want to
tell you.

20:06.798 --> 20:08.823
What's that?
Fuck you, fat ass.

20:09.801 --> 20:12.668
Melvin,
clean up the toilets.
It stinks over here.

20:12.737 --> 20:14.467
Okay, I'll be right there.

20:20.212 --> 20:22.578
Look what you did,
you fucking asshole!

20:30.555 --> 20:31.784
Grant.

20:32.491 --> 20:33.958
Damn, girl.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.291
You are chocolate
for the eyes.

20:37.629 --> 20:40.929
I thought maybe you was dead
after the other night.

20:41.133 --> 20:43.658
I am dead. Don't I look it?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.240
The old half-Mexican around?

20:50.308 --> 20:52.971
At his mama's for the weekend.
I'm all alone.

20:53.745 --> 20:55.406
Besides this one.

21:12.764 --> 21:13.754
Hey.

21:13.865 --> 21:15.492
Hi.
Scared you?

21:15.767 --> 21:16.996
Hey, Bill.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.539
What you doing?
Oh, nothing. Just...

21:22.207 --> 21:24.608
I'm trying to get a buzz on,
but I can't.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.341
I'm too buff.
Got too much muscle mass.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.675
I don't know what it is.
Oh, really?

21:31.716 --> 21:33.685
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.982
Yeah, on the promotion,
that's...
Thank you.

21:36.054 --> 21:37.454
Chief.
Yeah.

21:37.522 --> 21:38.614
Yeah.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.620
Sounds weird, doesn't it?
No, it sounds nice.

21:45.497 --> 21:47.124
So where's old Grant?

21:48.333 --> 21:51.394
I don't know.
He was supposed to
meet me here, but...

21:54.639 --> 21:57.006
It's kind of chilly tonight.
Yeah.

21:57.075 --> 21:58.600
It sure is pretty.

22:09.588 --> 22:11.249
You know...
It's probably time

22:11.323 --> 22:13.450
for the countdown, almost.
Right.

22:13.525 --> 22:15.755
Yeah, I think Jack's gonna
make a speech or something.

22:15.827 --> 22:17.795
Well,
that will be interesting.

22:18.163 --> 22:19.562
Thank you.

22:22.667 --> 22:25.500
I would like to introduce
Mayor Jack MacReady.

22:37.015 --> 22:38.244
Thank you.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.983
Cheese and crackers.
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:46.258 --> 22:49.386
right after God invented
this world of ours,

22:50.428 --> 22:51.828
he came unto Adam

22:52.597 --> 22:55.396
and he said that man
should have dominion

22:56.401 --> 22:58.392
over the fish of the sea,

22:59.037 --> 23:01.301
and over the birds of the air,

23:02.274 --> 23:04.708
and over every living thing

23:04.776 --> 23:07.677
that moveth upon the Earth.

23:07.746 --> 23:09.339
Amen! All right! Yeah!

23:09.414 --> 23:13.442
Now, I believe
when God said that,

23:15.153 --> 23:17.952
he was thinking of
deer season in Wheelsy

23:18.023 --> 23:20.992
and how much damn fun it is
to shoot a buck or two!

23:21.059 --> 23:22.720
Huh? Am I right?

23:30.969 --> 23:32.334
Are you ready?

23:32.504 --> 23:33.801
Yes!

23:33.872 --> 23:37.934
Ten, nine, eight,

23:38.410 --> 23:42.403
seven, six, five,

23:42.914 --> 23:46.680
four, three, two,

23:46.918 --> 23:48.010
one!

23:48.353 --> 23:49.445
Oh, God, Grant!

23:50.288 --> 23:53.690
Let the hunt begin!

23:54.592 --> 23:57.858
Grant, what is it? No!

25:25.116 --> 25:26.345
Grant?

25:36.060 --> 25:38.461
Grant,
you know about this fuse?

25:49.441 --> 25:51.807
Grant, why didn't you
answer your phone?

26:02.921 --> 26:04.115
Grant?

26:09.494 --> 26:12.054
Oh, my God, baby,
what happened to your face?

26:12.464 --> 26:14.329
It's just a bee sting.

26:17.969 --> 26:19.630
I'll be all right.

26:20.238 --> 26:22.798
I have a little reaction,
that's all.

26:23.274 --> 26:25.607
Oh, we gotta get you
to the hospital.
No.

26:25.677 --> 26:27.270
No, no, no, no.

26:27.679 --> 26:29.647
I already saw Dr. Karl.

26:30.515 --> 26:32.313
Gave me a prescription,

26:32.383 --> 26:34.909
said it should clear up soon.

26:35.954 --> 26:38.980
Said things like this happen.

26:39.691 --> 26:42.091
Happens to people
all the time.

26:44.963 --> 26:46.794
Come on, baby, don't...

26:47.832 --> 26:49.596
Don't look at me like that.

26:52.971 --> 26:55.872
Yes, hi, Dr. Karl.
This is Starla Grant.

26:56.074 --> 26:59.373
O£, Starla. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.

26:59.444 --> 27:02.504
I was calling about...
About Grant's condition.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.776
I think that it may be
getting worse.

27:05.617 --> 27:07.642
What condition is that, dear?

27:08.720 --> 27:10.654
The one you just
saw him about.

27:11.089 --> 27:15.651
Starla, I haven't
seen your husband
in over a year.

28:04.075 --> 28:05.736
What's the matter?

28:06.277 --> 28:08.268
Come on now, don't cry.

28:08.913 --> 28:12.372
Now, look here.
You're doing a good job.

28:13.117 --> 28:16.553
I'm so hungry,
I think I'm gonna die.

28:16.621 --> 28:21.081
No, no, no, no. Here.
I got something here,
help you feel better.

28:23.861 --> 28:25.693
Brought you munchies.

28:27.432 --> 28:29.958
Come on now. Treat yourself.

28:32.737 --> 28:35.331
Yeah, that's my girl.

28:36.407 --> 28:38.637
Everything's
gonna be all right.

28:50.788 --> 28:52.347
Hey, Starla.
Hey.

28:53.291 --> 28:55.521
Bill. Wally.
Howdy.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.955
Grant around, by any chance?
Oh, no. He's not
home from work yet.

28:59.030 --> 29:02.329
Mr. Grant!
He's not home yet, Wally.
I just said.

29:04.268 --> 29:05.634
What's going on?

29:06.971 --> 29:08.905
Do you know
a Brenda Gutierrez?

29:09.240 --> 29:12.232
Maybe she
called the house, or...
No.

29:15.013 --> 29:16.173
What's...

29:16.247 --> 29:20.013
Girl disappeared Friday night.
Signs of a struggle
in the house.

29:20.318 --> 29:22.343
Here in town?
Yeah.

29:22.420 --> 29:25.720
The thing is,
people saw Grant
going into her house,

29:26.124 --> 29:28.524
and that's the last
anyone's seen of her.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.688
It must've been someone
that looks like Grant.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.526
Yeah. Maybe.

29:36.768 --> 29:39.999
But have him give me a call
as soon as he gets in.

29:41.172 --> 29:43.072
All right.
All right.

29:43.141 --> 29:44.369
Well, thanks.

29:46.044 --> 29:47.102
Night.

29:48.179 --> 29:49.169
Night.

31:33.084 --> 31:35.109
...116·.

31:37.288 --> 31:39.382
You've reached Chief Pardy.
No, no, no, no, no.

31:39.457 --> 31:42.859
Please leave a message
and your call will be
returned promptly.

31:43.194 --> 31:44.684
Bill! It's Starla.

31:44.996 --> 31:49.194
You were just here.
And you need to get back here
right now. I think...

31:49.400 --> 31:51.494
Grant is sick or something.

32:10.988 --> 32:14.481
Why are you running from me,
baby? I wasn't gonna hurt you!

32:14.759 --> 32:17.922
I love you, baby.
I tried not to change.

32:17.995 --> 32:20.021
No!
I'll get it.

32:20.631 --> 32:24.033
I'm too ugly for you now,
is that it?
You don't wanna hurt me.

32:24.101 --> 32:25.569
You betrayed me.

32:26.270 --> 32:28.034
I can't trust you no more.

32:28.406 --> 32:29.771
Let me go.

32:29.974 --> 32:33.137
Here, I got a little surprise
for you. Huh, sugarplum?

32:53.531 --> 32:56.159
Starla?
Starla, you in there?

32:57.335 --> 32:58.928
Starla, you all right?

33:00.371 --> 33:01.532
Stop!

33:12.350 --> 33:13.977
What the fuck was that?

33:47.485 --> 33:49.317
Whole damn Council's
a bunch of fucking morons.

33:49.387 --> 33:52.720
I don't know how any of them
got elected. They blame me
for it, like it's...

33:52.790 --> 33:55.020
Bill. Bill, we need to talk.

33:55.226 --> 33:56.921
Shit. Morning, Jack.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.860
We need to find this Grant,
I mean yesterday.

33:58.930 --> 34:01.194
Town Council lit
a Roman candle,
stuck it up my ass.

34:01.265 --> 34:03.165
Jack, your leisure activities
ain't my business.

34:03.234 --> 34:05.965
Hey, don't you fuck with me,
Bill. Your post here
as Chief is in dire straits.

34:06.037 --> 34:07.197
Nobody wants to go
hunting in a town

34:07.271 --> 34:08.500
with a pet-murdering
kidnapper in it.

34:08.572 --> 34:09.904
We'll find him, Jack.

34:09.974 --> 34:12.033
Ain't many places he can hide.
Looks like a damn squid.

34:12.109 --> 34:14.476
Sea World, maybe.
See? She heard you say squid.

34:14.545 --> 34:16.536
She's going to go out
and create a goddamn hysteria.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.138
Shelby,
you gonna create a hysteria?

34:18.215 --> 34:20.377
Not today, Bill.
What's this?

34:20.451 --> 34:22.818
I thought we could
use that like a police sketch,
Chief.

34:22.887 --> 34:25.879
You know,
take it door to door,
see if anybody recognizes him.

34:27.425 --> 34:29.621
Y'all show
some respect right now!

34:29.694 --> 34:32.594
And you! You don't know
what was in there.
You said it was dark!

34:32.663 --> 34:35.360
You don't know
what the hell you saw.
His arm was all bendy, Mayor.

34:35.433 --> 34:38.094
Well, it's obvious
the bastard's got
Lyme disease.

34:38.168 --> 34:39.762
What?
Lyme disease.

34:40.404 --> 34:41.804
You touch some deer feces

34:41.871 --> 34:45.309
and then you eat a sandwich
without washing your hands,

34:45.376 --> 34:46.741
you got your Lyme disease.

34:46.811 --> 34:48.870
And that makes you
look like a squid?

34:50.781 --> 34:52.681
Well, fuck you all
for laughing.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.478
Chief, another attack.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.281
Over at the Castavets'.
What?

34:56.353 --> 34:59.084
Grant's been stealing animals
off farms, edge of town.

34:59.156 --> 35:00.818
Oh, Jesus Christ.
All right, folks, let's go.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.326
Don't forget your guns.
We don't want any Lyme disease
popping out at us.

35:03.394 --> 35:06.090
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
Ha, ha, fucking ha.

35:07.331 --> 35:10.790
I reckon Grant ain't
got one of them
puppy calendars on his desk.

35:10.868 --> 35:13.769
He just don't strike me
as a real dog lover, is all.

35:14.038 --> 35:15.801
Hey, look!

35:17.274 --> 35:19.300
Knocked this one's head
clear on over here.

35:19.377 --> 35:21.368
Put that down, numb nuts.

35:21.712 --> 35:23.612
He drug the cow through here.

35:24.949 --> 35:26.644
How can one man do that?

35:26.784 --> 35:28.718
Slay all them dogs by hisself?

35:29.053 --> 35:32.045
Well, he's gotta be
in the forest. All three
ranches run alongside it.

35:32.123 --> 35:34.421
You think we should
get up a posse?

35:35.126 --> 35:36.286
Head in there?

35:36.360 --> 35:39.921
It's 100,000 acres.
Be finding a needle
in a fuckstack.

35:41.632 --> 35:42.895
Gather some folks together.

35:42.967 --> 35:45.936
I think I know where
Dr. Dolittle's gonna
strike next.

35:46.537 --> 35:47.834
Right after
Grant ran off,

35:47.905 --> 35:50.875
a calf went missing from here,
Raglan's ranch.

35:51.042 --> 35:54.842
Two nights ago,
a mare was stolen from this
property owned by Fitzgibbon.

35:54.912 --> 35:56.175
That rancher with
the cleft palate?

35:56.247 --> 35:58.010
Yeah. I know that guy.
He looks like a chipmunk.

35:58.082 --> 36:00.608
Your mama weren't too proud
when you came out neither,
Wally.

36:00.684 --> 36:02.846
And then we got
the Castavets right here.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.718
That's where last night's
shit storm took place.

36:04.789 --> 36:07.485
And if he keeps to that
pattern, next he's gonna
end up here,

36:07.558 --> 36:09.890
owned by a family
called the Strutemyers.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.021
I know you're all tired.
You've barely seen
your families.

36:13.097 --> 36:16.192
But we're gonna have to
go there tonight,
lie low and wait.

36:16.267 --> 36:18.133
Well, let's go and get
that son of a bitch, Chief!

36:18.202 --> 36:19.192
Yeah.
Yeah.

36:19.837 --> 36:21.464
All right, boys.

36:22.773 --> 36:26.107
Where's my little darling?
There she is.

36:28.846 --> 36:31.247
Hey, Bill, we got this
grenade we confiscated
from them jokers

36:31.315 --> 36:32.806
who wanted to use it
to fish for trout.

36:32.883 --> 36:34.874
No. We should be
all right with what we got.

36:34.952 --> 36:36.215
All right.

36:38.022 --> 36:40.388
I didn't know the Russkis
were invading.

36:41.358 --> 36:44.351
You seen this guy,
you'd have wished they was.

36:52.169 --> 36:54.229
Give me...
Just give me one second.

36:54.305 --> 36:56.671
Bill, I heard you're
going to get Grant.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.402
Yeah. We...
I think I should go with you.

36:58.476 --> 37:00.467
What? Go... Honey, no. No.

37:00.544 --> 37:01.739
Bill, you need to let me help.

37:01.812 --> 37:02.836
Look, I ain't well-read
on police procedure,

37:02.913 --> 37:03.937
but I'm sure there's
a heap of regulations

37:04.014 --> 37:05.812
No, this is my fault.
against taking
a civilian on a stakeout.

37:05.883 --> 37:07.908
I should've seen it coming.
This is my fault.
It ain't your fault!

37:07.985 --> 37:10.352
He tried to kill you.
He had all those
physical symptoms.

37:10.421 --> 37:11.820
He was acting peculiar...
Starla. Thank you.

37:11.889 --> 37:13.880
I was just trying to
pretend that it wasn't
happening, Bill.

37:13.958 --> 37:16.723
Thank you, Starla.
I appreciate the offer,
but I can't.

37:16.794 --> 37:19.525
If that girl's
still out there,
how are you gonna find her?

37:19.597 --> 37:21.895
How, unless you bring
Grant back alive?

37:22.233 --> 37:25.464
Your best...
Your only chance of
doing that is with me.

37:27.538 --> 37:29.165
She's got a point.

37:41.752 --> 37:43.379
Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

37:43.621 --> 37:46.147
You all done, honey?
Thank you.

37:48.092 --> 37:49.855
Hey, come on now.

37:51.028 --> 37:54.794
Kylie, what did you
do to your fingers?
Kiri Goshimi done them.

37:54.865 --> 37:56.731
She's Japanese.
Yeah?

37:56.901 --> 37:59.370
Looks more like that
Pokeyman's done them, to me.

38:00.871 --> 38:03.568
Foreign stuff is classy,
if you knew something.

38:06.844 --> 38:08.334
There's Jack.

38:08.913 --> 38:12.315
Now, I want you all to
stay inside tonight. You hear?

38:16.987 --> 38:18.353
Hey, Otis!

38:20.191 --> 38:21.783
This turns out to be
a mountain lion,

38:21.859 --> 38:24.123
we're gonna look like
a bunch of damn idiots.

38:24.195 --> 38:25.253
Oh, yeah?

38:28.499 --> 38:29.762
Thanks.

39:15.746 --> 39:18.545
Be a good night to
chase some pussy, wouldn't it?

39:20.351 --> 39:22.285
How about that
Deputy Margaret?

39:22.820 --> 39:26.415
You have a little
deputy thing going on,
you two?

39:27.892 --> 39:29.860
Margaret packs a box lunch.

39:30.828 --> 39:31.886
No shit.

39:37.868 --> 39:39.097
Hey, Starla.

39:40.938 --> 39:42.736
You remember that time
we were kids

39:42.806 --> 39:46.174
and you came knocking
on my window in the middle
of the night?

39:48.312 --> 39:50.110
So Starla here, 12.

39:50.714 --> 39:52.341
I guess I was 14.

39:52.850 --> 39:55.012
I said, "Starla, what the hell
are you doing out there?"

39:55.085 --> 39:59.045
She says that she's gonna
run away to Hollywood
and be a big star.

40:00.291 --> 40:03.192
And she knew I was
in the ROTC, so she says
she needs a bodyguard

40:03.260 --> 40:04.660
and invites me to come along.

40:04.728 --> 40:08.927
And I said, "Starla,
if there's anyone who can
take care of herself,

40:09.500 --> 40:12.959
"I think it's you.
I'm gonna have to decline. "

40:14.204 --> 40:15.672
How far did you get?

40:16.140 --> 40:17.403
About the bus stop.

40:18.742 --> 40:21.006
Because Ranger Rick here
called my dad.

40:21.078 --> 40:23.809
Damn. A cop from the get-go.
You son of a bitch!

40:24.181 --> 40:27.310
You fucked up our fame
and fortune there, Bill Pardy.

40:29.219 --> 40:30.414
Yeah.

40:32.056 --> 40:33.785
Yeah, I guess maybe I did.

40:52.343 --> 40:53.867
You said squid.

40:55.079 --> 40:56.376
It got worse.

41:11.295 --> 41:15.288
He looks like something
that fell off my dick
during the war.

41:15.733 --> 41:16.995
Hey. Hey.

41:21.805 --> 41:23.000
Grant?

41:23.474 --> 41:28.002
Holy shit.

41:33.150 --> 41:35.084
What are we
gonna do now, Bill?

41:36.186 --> 41:37.984
Cuffs won't even
fit on him.

41:50.401 --> 41:52.096
Starla, where are you...

41:57.975 --> 41:59.204
Go, go.

42:00.644 --> 42:01.907
Come on.

42:20.197 --> 42:21.426
Grant.

42:31.642 --> 42:33.303
It's okay, Grant.

42:34.578 --> 42:36.478
You're
just sick, is all.

42:36.547 --> 42:37.912
You're just sick.

42:40.050 --> 42:43.179
We're just here
to take you to get some help.

42:43.987 --> 42:45.148
Right now.

42:46.990 --> 42:48.720
And I'm gonna stay by you.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.019
Just like I swore I would.

42:53.397 --> 42:55.160
For better or worse.

42:55.599 --> 42:57.067
Much fucking worse.

42:58.368 --> 42:59.563
Grant.

43:01.038 --> 43:03.200
Marriage is a sacred bond.

43:05.509 --> 43:06.738
Right, baby?

43:13.484 --> 43:15.418
It's gonna be all right,
Grant.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.083
Just come with us.

43:27.431 --> 43:29.797
You stop right there,
you son of a bitch.

43:30.134 --> 43:32.830
Now, I don't care
what kind of
leprosy you got.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.463
We need to find that girl.

43:36.139 --> 43:38.074
Now you can make this peaceful

43:38.976 --> 43:40.671
or you can make it hard.

43:55.058 --> 43:56.924
No!
Fire!

43:57.160 --> 43:58.287
Fire!

43:58.829 --> 44:00.126
Move!
Grant!

44:00.197 --> 44:02.165
Get him!
Get him!

44:03.400 --> 44:06.427
Wally, on my tail!
Do not lose him in the woods!

44:08.071 --> 44:09.733
That fucking...

44:10.641 --> 44:12.802
Get the fuck
out of the way!

44:14.144 --> 44:15.908
I don't want to
lose anybody! Stay together!

44:15.979 --> 44:17.777
Wait for me. Wait for me.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.441
Come on out, you cocksucker!

44:22.653 --> 44:24.644
What are you,
some little pussy?

44:24.755 --> 44:25.949
You afraid?

44:27.424 --> 44:28.755
Psychology.

44:43.840 --> 44:45.103
Over there!

44:56.920 --> 45:00.049
Where did he go?
Now we ain't never
gonna find that girl.

45:00.123 --> 45:02.422
Starla,
get the hell out of here.

45:33.390 --> 45:35.119
What's that smell?

45:35.225 --> 45:36.590
Something dead.

45:37.561 --> 45:40.963
It's coming
from in there, ain't it?
Do you think he's inside?

46:01.385 --> 46:03.182
One, two, three.

46:04.421 --> 46:05.786
You suck.

46:07.224 --> 46:08.919
Margaret, get over here.

46:18.368 --> 46:20.667
Oh, God.

46:26.043 --> 46:28.443
Something's wrong with me.

46:31.148 --> 46:32.274
Yeah.

46:33.350 --> 46:36.115
Oh, Jesus! God!

46:43.160 --> 46:44.354
Brenda.

46:45.395 --> 46:48.991
Oh, I didn't want
no one seeing me like this.

46:51.968 --> 46:53.129
Shit.

46:54.171 --> 46:55.832
How's my boy, Bill?

46:56.239 --> 46:57.366
Is he all right?

46:57.441 --> 46:59.170
Boy's fine, Brenda.

47:02.045 --> 47:06.505
So what's
going on here exactly?

47:07.551 --> 47:11.647
I'm so fucking hungry, Bill.
I'm so hungry.

47:11.722 --> 47:14.520
I never knew anyone
could be so hungry.

47:16.293 --> 47:18.887
Do you mind handing me

47:19.429 --> 47:22.228
a piece of that possum
over there?

47:22.833 --> 47:24.528
Just a little bit.

47:30.941 --> 47:32.932
I think we best get you
to a hospital right quick.

47:33.009 --> 47:35.342
What the fuck they gonna do
with her in a hospital, Bill?

47:35.412 --> 47:36.402
Shut up.

47:37.547 --> 47:39.311
Jesus!
Why is she doing that?

47:39.383 --> 47:41.476
Her tumors is moving.
Relax.

47:42.419 --> 47:45.753
Somebody get her
to stop doing that shit!
It hurts, bitch!

47:47.357 --> 47:48.518
Jesus.

47:52.129 --> 47:54.029
Please help me!
Bill.

47:54.398 --> 47:57.492
Oh, the little fuckers
are tearing me apart!

48:00.170 --> 48:02.002
Oh, the bastard led us here.

48:09.746 --> 48:11.771
Christ,
look out, everybody!

48:17.420 --> 48:18.445
Fuck!

48:18.522 --> 48:19.921
Wally!

48:27.397 --> 48:30.560
Margaret, cover your mouth!
Don't let them in your mouth!

49:04.901 --> 49:06.267
God dang.

49:06.636 --> 49:08.366
Tried to get in my mouth.

49:09.372 --> 49:11.671
What kind of thing
wants you to eat it?

49:53.817 --> 49:56.718
Kylie, honey,
you're gonna turn into
a plum in there.

49:56.786 --> 49:59.688
Prune, Mama.
Plums turn into prunes.

49:59.756 --> 50:01.656
I know what turns into what.

50:01.725 --> 50:05.593
So I want you to finish up
in there and get yourself
into bed, you hear?

50:22.812 --> 50:25.748
Time to turn in, ladies.
Just a couple more pages, Mom.

50:25.815 --> 50:27.078
No.

50:27.150 --> 50:29.448
Besides, you know
what day tomorrow is.

50:29.519 --> 50:31.044
Family fun day.
Family fun day.

50:31.121 --> 50:32.213
That is correct.

50:32.289 --> 50:34.120
So good night.

50:35.225 --> 50:36.658
Sleep tight.

50:37.661 --> 50:39.595
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

50:40.597 --> 50:41.860
Night, night.
Night, Mom.

50:41.932 --> 50:43.297
Night.

51:59.876 --> 52:01.207
What the fuck?

52:38.281 --> 52:39.681
Mom!

52:41.718 --> 52:43.015
Mom!

52:43.686 --> 52:44.779
Mom!

52:52.595 --> 52:55.463
Help!
Emily! Jenna!

52:57.700 --> 52:59.259
Jenna, open the door!

54:43.173 --> 54:44.697
Shelby, come in.

54:44.774 --> 54:48.335
11-41. I need paramedics
out here right away.
I got four men down.

54:50.547 --> 54:52.139
Shelby, are you there?

54:55.919 --> 54:58.615
Shelby, we got
an emergency here.
This is Bill.

54:59.823 --> 55:01.120
Oh, crud.

55:01.891 --> 55:03.120
Shelby.

55:03.359 --> 55:05.658
This is no time for a break,
Shelby. I mean it.

55:05.728 --> 55:07.788
Shelby?
They alive?

55:07.864 --> 55:09.764
Shelby, I need your help now.

55:09.899 --> 55:11.367
Praise Jesus.

55:12.135 --> 55:15.503
Praise Jesus?
That's fucking pushing it.

55:15.939 --> 55:18.965
This shit's about as far
from God as shit can get.

55:19.042 --> 55:21.533
Either of you ever seen
anything like that?

55:21.978 --> 55:24.572
You ever heard
of anything like that?

55:27.383 --> 55:28.680
Me neither.

55:28.751 --> 55:31.448
And I watch Animal Planet
all the fucking time.

55:31.588 --> 55:32.714
I got no reception out here.

55:32.789 --> 55:35.019
I'm gonna run back to the car,
try to call the paramedics
from there.

55:35.091 --> 55:37.583
That's a long way
with those worms out there.

55:37.660 --> 55:40.721
Yeah, well,
nice change of pace
from shooting them deer.

55:41.130 --> 55:43.224
All right, you three,
get these folks
out of the barn.

55:43.299 --> 55:45.199
All the rot and stench
can't be doing them any good.

55:45.268 --> 55:47.202
You take this. I got my Colt.

55:48.838 --> 55:51.307
Be careful.
Yeah, there's a thought.

56:11.261 --> 56:13.286
You know what this is?

56:13.663 --> 56:15.256
You know what this is?

56:15.398 --> 56:18.129
It's goddamn
biological weapons,
that's what it is.

56:18.201 --> 56:20.795
Government's testing them
on Wheelsy. You know why?

56:20.870 --> 56:23.498
Because I don't take
no shit from nobody
at those State hearings.

56:23.573 --> 56:25.871
They wanna put a cock
in Jack MacReady,

56:26.342 --> 56:27.867
they can kiss my ass.

56:27.977 --> 56:31.174
If this shit is contagious,
I turn into a fucking mollusk,

56:31.247 --> 56:33.807
I'm gonna sue those bastards,
I swear to God!

56:34.918 --> 56:37.910
And you can sue right
alongside of me. I don't care
if you're a lesbo.

56:37.987 --> 56:39.284
You don't deserve this shit.

56:39.355 --> 56:40.618
It's like...

56:40.690 --> 56:44.149
Oh, man, it smells like
rotten mayonnaise in here.

57:25.034 --> 57:26.525
Hi, sugarplum.

57:28.671 --> 57:32.267
Marriage.
It's a sacred bond.

57:33.142 --> 57:34.667
Just like you said.

57:36.646 --> 57:40.639
What?
I'm sorry for trying to
strangle you and all.

57:40.850 --> 57:44.582
I lost my head.

57:45.555 --> 57:48.752
I didn't mean to do
none of them things I done.

57:49.459 --> 57:50.619
Not

57:51.260 --> 57:52.421
kill them

57:52.695 --> 57:53.719
pets.

57:55.331 --> 57:59.530
Not make Brenda a worm.

58:00.837 --> 58:03.897
But it's my nature,
ain't it?

58:05.475 --> 58:08.706
How can you blame
someone for acting

58:10.413 --> 58:13.007
according to his own nature?

58:13.583 --> 58:16.109
I wanted to tell you
what was going on,

58:16.185 --> 58:19.986
but I was afraid
you wouldn't love me no more.

58:22.191 --> 58:24.990
I never knew love, Starla...

58:25.061 --> 58:26.256
Wally?

58:26.829 --> 58:28.058
You all right?

58:29.365 --> 58:32.528
Maybe you better
set back down.
You don't look so good.

58:32.835 --> 58:33.928
Hey.

58:58.227 --> 59:01.789
Kylie, honey, you okay?

59:01.864 --> 59:04.231
Hi, Kylie, it's me.

59:04.300 --> 59:07.327
Kylie, open the door,
jellybean.

59:07.403 --> 59:08.495
Come on, Kylie.

59:08.571 --> 59:10.198
Open the door.

59:10.273 --> 59:13.800
We love you, sweetheart.
Come on out now.
Open the door.

59:13.876 --> 59:15.105
Get away!

59:15.978 --> 59:17.469
You all get away.

59:17.547 --> 59:22.246
Kylie. Kylie, there's
no excuse. No excuse
not to be with your family.

59:22.318 --> 59:25.015
This is family fun day,
isn't it, Kylie?

59:25.455 --> 59:29.050
Y'all better just
set back down.
You need to get some rest.

59:29.659 --> 59:31.320
You're sick!
Meat.

59:31.894 --> 59:33.590
Hey!
Let her go!

59:34.831 --> 59:37.459
Y'all just take
a step back now, all right?

59:37.967 --> 59:39.935
There you go, sugarplum.

59:41.137 --> 59:43.572
Why you choosing camps
before you hear

59:43.639 --> 59:45.767
both sides of the story?
Both sides of the story.

59:45.842 --> 59:49.107
Why are you talking
like Grant?
'Cause I am Grant.

59:49.278 --> 59:50.712
I'm your husband.
I'm your husband.

59:50.780 --> 59:53.579
You swore to honor
and obey me.
Obey me.

59:53.649 --> 59:57.017
So put that goddamn gun down.
So put that goddamn gun down.

59:59.622 --> 01:00:01.249
Oh, shit.

01:00:01.524 --> 01:00:03.014
Get away from her!

01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:06.057
It burns. What the...

01:00:08.798 --> 01:00:10.527
Get away from her!
Meat.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:13.433
Get away from her!
I am gonna shoot you,
I swear to God!

01:00:13.503 --> 01:00:15.733
You ain't
gonna shoot me, Starla.

01:00:16.506 --> 01:00:20.875
I told you, you always
needed me to protect you!

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:24.569
You for damn sure
ain't got the balls to...

01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:33.087
Christ on a cross.

01:00:40.163 --> 01:00:41.824
Go. Go, go, go.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.730
Uncle Grant's gonna
show you a good time, girlie.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.961
Get out!

01:00:46.035 --> 01:00:49.027
Open this door,
you little whore!

01:00:49.105 --> 01:00:51.039
Don't mess with me,
you little slut.

01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:53.303
Kylie.

01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:56.637
This is your last chance.

01:00:56.712 --> 01:00:58.510
Open this door now!

01:01:00.182 --> 01:01:01.775
Come on,
you spoiled brat!

01:01:01.851 --> 01:01:03.080
No!

01:01:04.253 --> 01:01:05.414
No!

01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:08.221
You little bitch!
Hey!

01:01:11.027 --> 01:01:13.962
What's going on?
What the hell are you doing?

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.365
Hey, hey, easy, easy, easy.

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:20.562
What the hell
happened to you, Otis?

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.671
Poison ivy out back, maybe?

01:01:23.873 --> 01:01:25.705
We're itchy.
We're itchy.

01:01:25.775 --> 01:01:27.766
No, they're not my parents.

01:01:27.877 --> 01:01:30.107
They're trying to trick you.

01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:32.705
Hey.
The worms are in their brains.

01:01:33.849 --> 01:01:36.216
All right, look,
y'all stay right there
on the spot.

01:01:36.285 --> 01:01:38.379
I'm gonna call the paramedics
to come help you.

01:01:38.454 --> 01:01:40.354
And Kylie's gonna
come with me.

01:01:40.423 --> 01:01:41.788
Hey there, killer.

01:01:48.364 --> 01:01:50.526
Starla's my woman, you prick.

01:02:02.411 --> 01:02:06.974
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:16.086
Come on.

01:02:19.295 --> 01:02:21.661
Damn it!
Come on, Kylie.

01:02:21.797 --> 01:02:23.527
Hey, come on, come on.

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:27.533
Don't mess with me,
little girl!

01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:30.205
Hear me, girl?

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.939
What's with the spitting?

01:02:36.579 --> 01:02:38.945
Margaret, come in.
Margaret? Margaret,
are you there?

01:02:39.015 --> 01:02:41.108
Chief, go!
They're gonna get in. Go!

01:02:41.183 --> 01:02:43.652
My friends
are still out there... Trevor?

01:02:45.921 --> 01:02:47.685
What the heck is going on?

01:02:51.661 --> 01:02:55.290
My easygoing nature is getting
sorely fucking tested.

01:03:24.493 --> 01:03:25.722
Bitch is hard-core.

01:03:25.795 --> 01:03:28.093
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

01:03:28.164 --> 01:03:29.529
All right, yeah.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:30.922
Go, go.

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.959
Go! Go! Go!

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.760
Starla!

01:03:35.838 --> 01:03:39.536
Starla! Starla!
Starla! Starla!

01:03:40.042 --> 01:03:41.601
Starla!

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:55.985
So,

01:03:56.892 --> 01:03:58.883
how's everybody's evening?
Good?

01:03:59.995 --> 01:04:01.156
Good.

01:04:02.665 --> 01:04:03.894
Thanks.

01:04:09.672 --> 01:04:10.935
Shelby?

01:04:15.277 --> 01:04:16.939
Shelby, you there?

01:04:17.146 --> 01:04:19.842
Hey, Chief,
how you doing?
Did you find that...

01:04:21.517 --> 01:04:24.077
There's a skeeter in here
driving me bonkers.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.311
Shelby,
you seen any of these...

01:04:26.856 --> 01:04:28.414
I don't know
what to call them.

01:04:28.491 --> 01:04:31.255
They're like big slugs,
only they're fast.

01:04:31.527 --> 01:04:32.824
No slugs.

01:04:32.895 --> 01:04:36.126
But your mama called.
She said, "The toilet's
all backed up again.

01:04:36.198 --> 01:04:38.292
"Why don't you come over
soon as you're
finished there?"

01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:39.425
All right, sweetheart, listen.

01:04:39.502 --> 01:04:41.971
I need you to listen to me
just for a second, okay?

01:04:42.037 --> 01:04:45.804
She said it's what you done
in there on Sunday
what caused the backup.

01:04:47.543 --> 01:04:49.511
All right, listen.
I need you to...

01:04:49.578 --> 01:04:52.446
I need you to get the CDC
on the horn for me, okay?

01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.547
Shelby, are you nodding?

01:04:58.154 --> 01:05:00.918
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'll get you right back.

01:05:05.828 --> 01:05:09.321
There's a big tree
in her front yard and
the roots got in the pipes

01:05:09.398 --> 01:05:12.629
and it messes with
the whole system
on the way to the main.

01:05:13.903 --> 01:05:15.530
She uses lots of paper.

01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:34.220
Where is the Mr. Pibb?

01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:40.388
I told your secretary
to pack Mr. Pibb.
It's the only Coke I like.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:45.561
Goddamn Brenda exploding
like a water balloon

01:05:45.634 --> 01:05:48.866
and worms driving
my friends around like
they're goddamn skin-cars.

01:05:48.938 --> 01:05:51.668
People are spitting acid
at me, turning you into
cottage cheese,

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.700
and now there's no fucking
goddamn Mr. Pibb!

01:05:55.778 --> 01:05:58.440
Jesus Christ, Jack.
Let me get right on it.

01:06:01.984 --> 01:06:03.315
It was me.

01:06:04.053 --> 01:06:06.715
I became it... Him.

01:06:08.157 --> 01:06:10.057
Part of him.
Who?

01:06:12.528 --> 01:06:13.620
Who?

01:06:14.663 --> 01:06:16.461
Mrs. Grant's husband.

01:06:18.334 --> 01:06:20.063
But it wasn't always him.

01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:23.632
He came from...

01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:32.404
He's a goddamn Martian?
Martians is from Mars, Jack.

01:06:32.481 --> 01:06:35.610
Or it's a general term meaning
"outer space fucker. "

01:06:35.684 --> 01:06:37.880
No, it isn't.
Look it up, cocksucker.

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:39.148
Enough.

01:06:40.256 --> 01:06:41.518
Kylie.

01:06:42.191 --> 01:06:43.351
Honey.

01:06:45.027 --> 01:06:46.722
Honey, what do you mean?

01:06:47.263 --> 01:06:49.390
His real face
looks like a needle.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:51.964
But he's always got another.

01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:54.970
He goes from place to place,

01:06:55.037 --> 01:06:57.563
worlds, planets, killing them.

01:06:58.741 --> 01:07:02.905
Some he gets pregnant,
others he just takes over
with his worms.

01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:06.505
And the rest he eats
till they're gone.

01:07:09.418 --> 01:07:10.909
Now he's here.

01:07:11.954 --> 01:07:13.149
Are you saying
these worms...

01:07:13.222 --> 01:07:15.623
These worms in their brains,
you saying
they're all connected?

01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:16.851
It's like
they're all one deal?

01:07:16.926 --> 01:07:21.158
An animal
that doesn't procreate.
It spreads, grows,

01:07:21.897 --> 01:07:25.857
absorbing the minds and bodies
of the organisms around it.

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:29.861
It's a conscious disease.

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.942
If I weren't about
to shit my pants,
I'd be fucking fascinated.

01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:39.572
We're back.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:51.025
Shelby,
did you get the CDC for me?
We're at the city limits.

01:07:51.093 --> 01:07:52.686
Welcome back,

01:07:53.462 --> 01:07:54.520
killer.

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:58.899
Got a little surprise
for the lot of you,
just right around the corner.

01:08:25.728 --> 01:08:27.457
Starla!

01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:37.466
Starla. Starla! Let her go!

01:08:37.606 --> 01:08:38.801
Jesus.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:52.881
Meat.

01:08:55.057 --> 01:08:56.183
Meat.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.191
Chief!
Come on, come here.

01:09:04.633 --> 01:09:07.466
Stay here. Stay here.
Jack, wake up.

01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:09.764
Wake up!
Hurry!

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:12.267
Jack!

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:13.901
Meat.

01:09:17.845 --> 01:09:18.904
Meat.

01:09:34.997 --> 01:09:36.328
Stay here.

01:09:50.546 --> 01:09:52.274
Worms beat us here.

01:09:57.786 --> 01:09:59.413
Okay. All right.

01:10:00.389 --> 01:10:02.619
There's a grenade
in that station.

01:10:03.225 --> 01:10:06.661
Now, if I use that to destroy
Grant... He's the center of
the whole system, right?

01:10:06.729 --> 01:10:09.459
Does that mean
the whole thing
will be destroyed?

01:10:09.565 --> 01:10:11.294
Maybe.
Maybe.

01:10:12.568 --> 01:10:13.762
Okay.

01:10:17.039 --> 01:10:18.199
Okay.

01:10:19.274 --> 01:10:21.766
You wait here.
All right? Stay hid.

01:10:22.544 --> 01:10:23.841
I'll be back.

01:11:03.919 --> 01:11:06.354
Okay. All right.

01:11:07.089 --> 01:11:08.215
Easy.

01:11:37.586 --> 01:11:39.111
This is Chief Pardy.

01:11:44.059 --> 01:11:45.390
I can't...

01:12:02.845 --> 01:12:04.107
Fuck me.

01:12:10.686 --> 01:12:11.812
No!

01:12:24.533 --> 01:12:27.002
Get... Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:33.540
Hey. Motherfucker.

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.613
Thank you. Come on, come on.

01:12:46.088 --> 01:12:49.421
We gotta go.
Once one sees us,
they all see us.

01:12:52.194 --> 01:12:54.629
Okay. Take this. Here.

01:13:01.937 --> 01:13:03.302
Starla.

01:13:37.372 --> 01:13:38.806
Oh, God!

01:13:39.641 --> 01:13:41.632
Sweetie, don't look.
Don't look.

01:13:44.846 --> 01:13:46.041
What are we gonna do now?

01:13:46.114 --> 01:13:48.083
Probably turn into a couple
of these fucked-up things.

01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:51.313
That's kind of negative.
Well,
it's been that sort of day.

01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:57.525
Thank you for saving
my ass back there.
You're welcome.

01:13:57.592 --> 01:14:00.255
Of course, when I tell
that story, it's gonna be
the other way around.

01:14:00.329 --> 01:14:02.593
What do you mean?
Like I saved you.

01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:05.764
Yeah, if we live.
Right.

01:14:07.502 --> 01:14:09.164
Now, they're dragging
these bodies due north.

01:14:09.237 --> 01:14:11.729
Do you think that will
lead us to Ms. Grant?

01:14:11.807 --> 01:14:13.502
You like her, don't you?

01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:16.840
Come on.

01:14:40.102 --> 01:14:42.400
Starla,
don't you be fooling, girl.

01:14:42.471 --> 01:14:44.029
Come on down!

01:15:02.290 --> 01:15:03.690
Who's there?

01:15:06.128 --> 01:15:07.186
Bill?

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.356
Bill?

01:15:10.432 --> 01:15:11.627
Starla?

01:15:16.471 --> 01:15:17.700
Hello?

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:38.657
Don't you look
at me like that!

01:15:41.263 --> 01:15:43.322
Don't you judge me!

01:15:44.433 --> 01:15:48.233
You got no idea
what it's like
to be this hungry!

01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:51.432
I just ate pig
and I still want more.

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:54.404
Oh, God damn!
Don't you dare judge me!

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:58.806
Are you trying to judge me?
Damn Republican.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.282
We'll run all
you Republicans out of town.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:29.370
Starla,
I hear you in there.

01:16:29.911 --> 01:16:34.246
Come on down and fulfill
your wifely duties,
you hear me?

01:17:33.074 --> 01:17:36.067
Starla. Starla.

01:18:20.055 --> 01:18:22.353
You said for better or worse!

01:18:22.424 --> 01:18:23.982
You lied!

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:25.717
Bitch!

01:18:26.094 --> 01:18:27.323
Slut!

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:28.827
Whore!

01:18:37.038 --> 01:18:38.938
There's the worm heads.

01:18:39.708 --> 01:18:41.835
That's where
they're bringing the bodies.

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:44.936
Probably new breeders
feeding inside.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:48.347
Oh, my God, that's Grant.

01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:51.879
That's where
they're joining together.

01:19:06.468 --> 01:19:08.766
Well, now,
that is some fucked-up shit.

01:19:14.676 --> 01:19:16.235
There's Starla.

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:19.275
Okay. Okay.

01:19:20.982 --> 01:19:22.814
All right. All right.

01:19:23.084 --> 01:19:26.384
You stay here.
No, I ain't
staying here by myself.

01:19:29.157 --> 01:19:30.886
All right, come on.

01:19:39.301 --> 01:19:44.204
You tried to kill me
and run off with Pardy.

01:19:44.406 --> 01:19:47.068
You just wanna fuck him now,
cause he's so good-looking.

01:19:47.142 --> 01:19:48.871
It's all over, Starla.

01:19:48.943 --> 01:19:52.345
And I'll keep growing
till I'm everywhere.

01:19:52.414 --> 01:19:54.814
Till I'm all that is!

01:19:56.317 --> 01:19:59.310
Then you'll know
what it feels like
to be betrayed.

01:19:59.387 --> 01:20:01.219
Won't you, sugarplum?

01:20:01.589 --> 01:20:04.252
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:20:04.659 --> 01:20:07.424
I just thought
you were trying to kill me.

01:20:07.996 --> 01:20:11.898
And you can't expect me
not to go through

01:20:13.468 --> 01:20:14.993
some adjustments

01:20:16.004 --> 01:20:17.995
after all these changes.

01:20:21.476 --> 01:20:24.104
You did a real nice job
decorating, baby.

01:20:24.746 --> 01:20:26.578
You like these memories?

01:20:27.182 --> 01:20:28.342
Yeah.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.349
I know you don't wanna
hurt me, Grant.

01:20:39.594 --> 01:20:40.720
Yeah.

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:43.594
You like being called Grant,

01:20:44.265 --> 01:20:45.460
don't you?

01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:48.998
I can do that.

01:20:50.038 --> 01:20:51.767
I can call you that.

01:20:53.141 --> 01:20:55.735
'Cause you're lonely. Right?

01:20:56.878 --> 01:21:00.314
You've been alone so long
I can't even imagine, I bet.

01:21:02.917 --> 01:21:06.149
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.152
'Cause you and I,

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:14.024
we could be together.

01:21:14.863 --> 01:21:17.832
I never had much use
for this world, anyway.

01:21:20.068 --> 01:21:24.938
And I can stay with you
while you do
what you need to do.

01:21:25.907 --> 01:21:29.901
'Cause it's your nature,
and I see that now.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.671
I'm here for you.

01:22:14.422 --> 01:22:15.446
Pardy!

01:22:15.523 --> 01:22:18.755
Kill me, Pardy, please!

01:22:19.994 --> 01:22:24.591
You Podunk whore!
I've been around
a billion years.

01:22:24.666 --> 01:22:26.930
You think you can
fuck with me?

01:22:28.937 --> 01:22:30.063
Yep.

01:22:32.373 --> 01:22:33.534
Shit!

01:24:30.124 --> 01:24:31.490
Shoot him.

01:24:31.726 --> 01:24:33.091
Shoot him!

01:25:43.398 --> 01:25:44.558
Bill.

01:25:47.535 --> 01:25:48.627
Bill.

01:25:50.705 --> 01:25:51.831
Bill.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.767
Bill.

01:25:56.677 --> 01:25:58.805
Oh, that...
That really hurt.

01:26:08.823 --> 01:26:10.188
Are you all right?

01:26:11.392 --> 01:26:14.760
You need both of them things
in you to get all wormy.

01:26:14.896 --> 01:26:17.729
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

01:26:56.904 --> 01:27:00.966
Bet you regret not running off
with me to Hollywood now,
hey, Bill?

01:27:01.776 --> 01:27:03.471
Oh, hell, Starla,

01:27:04.145 --> 01:27:05.840
I always regretted that.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.617
Now, Bishopville's just
a few miles down the 10.

01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:19.558
They got that hospital there
with the big green
steeple thingy up top.

01:27:22.764 --> 01:27:27.497
Hey, Kylie, why don't you tell
Ms. Grant that story about how
I saved you from that deer?

01:27:27.702 --> 01:27:28.965
Oh, yeah.

01:27:29.203 --> 01:27:31.035
Bill saved me from a deer.

01:27:32.807 --> 01:27:34.070
Oh, yeah?
