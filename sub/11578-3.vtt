00:23.222 --> 00:25.032
In the criminal justice system,

00:25.032 --> 00:28.794
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.794 --> 00:30.036
In New York City,

00:30.036 --> 00:33.720
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.720 --> 00:36.503
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.765
These are their stories.

00:40.978 --> 00:44.204
911 emergency operator 307.
What is your emergency?

00:44.204 --> 00:47.199
I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel.
I haven't moved in 45 minutes.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.634
You reporting an accident, sir?

00:48.634 --> 00:49.833
It's almost midnight.

00:49.833 --> 00:51.878
What the hell's up with the traffic?

00:51.878 --> 00:55.139
911 emergency operator 307.
What is your emergency?

00:55.139 --> 00:57.424
There's a rape.
Right now.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.679
88 West Franklin.

00:59.679 --> 01:01.208
- Now, get down!
- Get away from me!

01:01.208 --> 01:03.477
I said get... / Hello?

01:04.358 --> 01:06.705
Two-seven-Charlie,
respond to a 10-34.

01:06.705 --> 01:09.740
Assault in progress at 88 West Franklin.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.465
No suspect description.
Line disconnected. Respond Code 3.

01:13.465 --> 01:14.427
What've you got?

01:14.427 --> 01:16.075
911 didn't get an apartment number.

01:16.075 --> 01:18.301
Probably a cell phone call.
We're knocking on doors.

01:18.301 --> 01:19.755
Perp may still be in there?

01:19.755 --> 01:21.052
Yeah, if there is a perp.

01:21.052 --> 01:22.394
Wouldn't be the first prank call.

01:22.394 --> 01:23.938
- You guys from Special Victims?
- Yeah.

01:23.938 --> 01:26.036
Found this under the fire escape.

01:28.025 --> 01:29.522
"Lori."

01:29.522 --> 01:31.405
Got her. 3-B.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.243
Special Victims. Benson, Stabler.

01:36.243 --> 01:37.712
- How you doing?
- I heard some crying.

01:37.712 --> 01:39.442
The door's unlocked.
She's in the shower.

01:39.442 --> 01:42.860
I started to go in, but she started
freaking out on me, so I backed off.

01:42.860 --> 01:44.179
Thanks.

01:45.546 --> 01:48.198
Stay away! / Lori?

01:48.198 --> 01:49.417
Gina?

01:49.417 --> 01:51.195
It's Olivia.

01:52.977 --> 01:55.448
- It's filthy in here.
- That's okay.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.634
I'm going to help you.

02:02.626 --> 02:04.934
- Lori?
- Please don't come in here.

02:04.934 --> 02:07.576
This place is filthy.

02:18.509 --> 02:19.988
Lori?

02:22.904 --> 02:26.089
Hey, how long you been in the shower?

02:28.659 --> 02:30.164
This drain...

02:30.164 --> 02:32.624
- I want this stuff out of here.
- What stuff?

02:32.624 --> 02:35.196
The stuff he washed off me.
I want it out of here.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.206
Lori, the stuff is long gone.

02:37.206 --> 02:40.343
You've already washed it all away.
It's okay.

02:42.189 --> 02:44.065
It's okay.

02:52.855 --> 02:54.596
It's okay.

02:57.238 --> 02:59.085
Give me your hand.

03:00.390 --> 03:03.903
- There you go.
- This is really happening, isn't it?

03:04.077 --> 03:05.662
Come on.

03:10.014 --> 03:12.001
"Is this how you like it?

03:12.001 --> 03:14.600
"Is this how you like it?"
That's all he kept saying to me.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.923
- The man who made you dirty?
- Yeah.

03:18.979 --> 03:20.043
There you go.

03:20.043 --> 03:21.350
Got her?

03:22.094 --> 03:23.349
Stay with me.

03:23.349 --> 03:25.581
Back in one second, okay?

03:26.701 --> 03:28.951
He washed her. Asked her,
"Is this how you like it?"

03:28.951 --> 03:32.254
His favorite neighborhood,
his type, blonde, petite, single.

03:32.254 --> 03:34.602
Bastard's at it again.

03:36.322 --> 03:38.665
Why am I not surprised?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/11/03

04:30.906 --> 04:32.261
It's him.

04:32.485 --> 04:34.245
- It has to be him.
- Not so fast.

04:34.245 --> 04:37.022
It's been a year since
we had Cleary in here as a suspect.

04:37.022 --> 04:39.532
Same M.O. Probably came in
off the fire escape.

04:39.532 --> 04:42.607
He rapes them, asks them
if they like it, he bathes them

04:42.607 --> 04:45.263
and then he steals a piece
of jewelry as a memento.

04:45.263 --> 04:47.581
It's him. Kenneth Cleary.

04:47.581 --> 04:49.202
We had him and we lost him.

04:49.202 --> 04:51.455
We couldn't keep him.
Not our fault.

04:51.455 --> 04:53.389
You want to tell the victim that?

04:53.773 --> 04:55.003
Hey.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.408
We're going to go in here.

05:00.271 --> 05:02.318
Lori, did you open the window?

05:02.318 --> 05:03.865
Yes.

05:03.865 --> 05:08.883
The night, it was cool.
I like to sleep under heavy blankets.

05:09.180 --> 05:12.237
He pulled my blanket off me.

05:12.237 --> 05:14.845
My shirt was over my eyes.

05:14.845 --> 05:17.899
A button got caught in my mouth.

05:18.161 --> 05:20.632
He hit me.

05:21.425 --> 05:22.334
Then what happened?

05:22.334 --> 05:24.168
He tried to kiss her.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.319
He tried to kiss me.

05:26.319 --> 05:29.660
He yanked that button out of my mouth

05:29.660 --> 05:32.126
and kissed my neck.

05:32.873 --> 05:35.289
His lips were dry.

05:35.289 --> 05:39.047
My necklace, he ripped off.

05:40.693 --> 05:44.275
He was inside me.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.823
He pushed hard.

05:46.823 --> 05:48.862
It hurt.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.413
But he kept saying...

05:50.413 --> 05:52.282
"Is this how you like it?"

05:52.282 --> 05:55.743
"Is this how you like it?"

05:55.743 --> 05:57.385
He...

05:58.272 --> 06:00.065
finished.

06:00.065 --> 06:03.880
Then he brought me into the bathroom.

06:04.179 --> 06:07.680
He made me take a shower.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.438
My shirt got wet, heavy.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.873
Did you see his face?

06:16.344 --> 06:19.743
My shirt was over my eyes.

06:20.068 --> 06:22.193
He told me not to look.

06:22.193 --> 06:24.361
None of his victims could ID him.

06:24.361 --> 06:25.845
Nothing from Forensics.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.579
There never is with Kenneth Cleary.

06:28.579 --> 06:33.372
When he heard the sirens,
he pushed me back and...

06:33.372 --> 06:37.148
- I hit my head on the tiles.
- Heard the sirens?

06:37.148 --> 06:39.508
Did you call the police?

06:40.655 --> 06:42.529
No.

06:42.529 --> 06:45.168
- We got a witness.
- You move slow.

06:45.168 --> 06:48.512
We go after Cleary off this,
he'll be out the door again.

06:48.512 --> 06:52.468
- But not too slow.
- Move slow as fast as you can.

06:53.260 --> 06:56.063
Public Safety Answering Center 911
Monday, October 23

06:56.063 --> 06:57.102
There's a rape.

06:57.102 --> 07:00.389
Right now. 88 West Franklin.

07:00.389 --> 07:01.978
- Now, get down!
- Get away from me!

07:01.978 --> 07:02.993
I said get...

07:02.993 --> 07:04.874
So maybe two witnesses.

07:04.874 --> 07:06.237
Three, if you count the dog.

07:06.237 --> 07:08.350
Where'd the call come from?

07:09.291 --> 07:10.862
Pay phone on Franklin.

07:10.862 --> 07:12.519
You call back?

07:13.134 --> 07:16.177
Pay phone blocks incoming calls.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.646
Lori Thatcher's apartment is
on the third floor.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.631
You can't see into her apartment
from here, though.

07:27.631 --> 07:29.782
So who can?

07:32.855 --> 07:35.500
Two apartments could see to the rape.

07:36.257 --> 07:38.063
Look at that.

07:41.148 --> 07:42.129
Who is it?

07:42.129 --> 07:46.639
Mrs. Walton, New York Police.
Detectives Benson and Stabler.

07:48.233 --> 07:51.135
Can I see your badge, please?

08:01.395 --> 08:02.373
What's wrong?

08:02.373 --> 08:05.045
We're investigating an assault
in the building across the way.

08:05.045 --> 08:06.942
Last night. I heard the sirens.

08:06.942 --> 08:09.871
- No one's home next door.
- No, they're on vacation.

08:09.871 --> 08:12.160
- How long have they been gone?
- A week.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.215
They're very nice.
They give Hank...

08:14.215 --> 08:16.850
his last walk of the night for me
when they're here.

08:16.850 --> 08:17.996
I hate it when they're gone.

08:17.996 --> 08:22.152
Your apartment looks into the apartment
where the assault took place.

08:23.395 --> 08:25.181
I'm blind, Detective.

08:25.181 --> 08:26.174
Yes, ma'am.

08:26.174 --> 08:29.637
But was anybody here with you
last night? / No.

08:29.637 --> 08:32.688
Billy was here, but just long
enough to take Hank out for me.

08:32.688 --> 08:34.106
And what time was that?

08:34.106 --> 08:36.297
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
The news was on.

08:36.297 --> 08:37.755
Which news?

08:37.755 --> 08:39.957
The 24 hour news.

08:39.957 --> 08:42.150
Okay. And Billy is?

08:42.467 --> 08:43.794
Billy Smith.

08:43.794 --> 08:46.588
The young man down in 1-G.
He's a doctor.

08:46.588 --> 08:48.308
Thank you very much.

08:48.308 --> 08:52.950
You know, if he's not in his apartment,
you might try the roof.

08:54.728 --> 08:56.303
I thought I could hide up here.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.523
Mrs. Walton gave you up there, Dr. Smith.

08:58.523 --> 08:59.820
I'm not a doctor yet.

08:59.820 --> 09:03.335
Did you walk Mrs.
Walton's dog last night? / Yeah, Hank.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.684
What time?

09:05.001 --> 09:06.057
11:00.

09:06.057 --> 09:08.270
Could it have been closer to 12:00?

09:08.270 --> 09:10.153
Could have been 3:00 a.m.
For all I know.

09:10.153 --> 09:13.698
I got sleep deprivation,
light deprivation, time.

09:13.698 --> 09:15.072
If I don't pass this exam...

09:15.072 --> 09:17.855
When you walked Hank,
did he bark or lunge at a woman

09:17.855 --> 09:20.355
using the pay phone
that's right down in front there?

09:20.355 --> 09:21.835
He's a guide dog.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.723
He's trained not to.

09:23.723 --> 09:26.754
Why don't you try the news stand
at the end of the block?

09:26.754 --> 09:28.173
Ginger, quiet!

09:28.173 --> 09:29.437
Down.

09:31.432 --> 09:33.339
Sorry about that.

09:34.021 --> 09:35.480
He can't be good for business.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.046
- No, but he's great for theft.
- Yeah, I bet.

09:38.046 --> 09:39.387
Last night...

09:39.387 --> 09:42.235
did he attack a woman at the phone booth
at the end of the street?

09:42.235 --> 09:44.994
He never touched her.
I had him on the leash.

09:44.994 --> 09:46.441
She's got no business calling the cops.

09:46.441 --> 09:49.016
Actually, sir, we're investigating
another matter.

09:49.016 --> 09:50.913
Think you could describe her?

09:51.702 --> 09:53.173
Blonde.

09:53.173 --> 09:54.258
Age?

09:54.258 --> 09:57.818
Thirty, maybe.
Thin, but not too thin.

09:57.818 --> 10:00.153
Could you describe her
to a police sketch artist?

10:00.153 --> 10:01.728
I didn't get a look at her face.

10:01.728 --> 10:04.451
I was too busy trying to get
Ginger into the car.

10:04.451 --> 10:06.112
You remember what she was wearing?

10:06.112 --> 10:11.792
Yeah. A black sweater, and black slacks
and thong panties.

10:11.792 --> 10:14.985
You didn't get a look at her face but
you know she was wearing thong panties?

10:14.985 --> 10:16.559
I saw the panty line.

10:16.559 --> 10:18.082
She had a nice ass,

10:18.082 --> 10:21.084
which is more interesting to me
than her face.

10:22.302 --> 10:26.224
I'm an ass man,
I don't apologize for it.

10:26.371 --> 10:29.043
So we have the dog,
but not the witness.

10:29.043 --> 10:30.584
Maybe the dog can ID Cleary.

10:30.584 --> 10:31.809
We don't know that it's Cleary.

10:31.809 --> 10:33.162
Like hell we don't.

10:33.162 --> 10:34.604
We can't make him for it yet.

10:34.604 --> 10:37.282
You have to stay open
to the possibility it's someone else.

10:37.282 --> 10:40.313
Come on, Captain.
The M.O. Matches.

10:40.313 --> 10:44.484
The victims are identical types.
Their injuries are virtually identical.

10:44.484 --> 10:46.260
At least he's not getting rougher.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.659
How is Miss Thatcher?

10:47.659 --> 10:50.113
She coming out of shock,
going into numb.

10:50.113 --> 10:51.403
Staying at her parents.

10:51.403 --> 10:54.983
911 call terminated at 12:03:39 a.m.

10:54.983 --> 10:58.730
And at 12:04 another call was
made from the same pay phone.

10:58.730 --> 11:03.944
To? / A Gramercy Park brownstone owned
by Mr. And Mrs. Kenneth Cleary.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.558
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

11:05.558 --> 11:09.502
Cleary's raping Lori at the same time
somebody's downstairs calling his house?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.090
I'm on it.

11:10.090 --> 11:14.090
Cleary sees you and Stabler again
you're done before you start.

11:18.187 --> 11:19.285
- Mrs. Cleary?
- Yes.

11:19.285 --> 11:20.826
Detectives Munch and Tutuola.

11:20.826 --> 11:23.019
Did you receive a call around midnight
last night?

11:23.019 --> 11:24.909
It's about time.

11:25.969 --> 11:28.224
I've been after the phone company
for the past two months

11:28.224 --> 11:29.976
to do something about these calls.

11:29.976 --> 11:31.091
You've had other calls?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.155
Some woman's harassing me.

11:33.155 --> 11:34.986
What does this woman say?

11:34.986 --> 11:37.244
"Your husband's a rapist."

11:37.244 --> 11:40.686
Last night, she said,
"He's raping someone right now."

11:40.686 --> 11:44.847
Last night there was a rape in the building
by the pay phone that call was made from.

11:44.847 --> 11:47.042
Was your husband home last night?

11:47.375 --> 11:48.956
My husband's not a rapist.

11:48.956 --> 11:51.347
Was your husband home last night?

11:52.416 --> 11:53.785
Yes.

11:53.785 --> 11:54.974
He didn't walk the dog?

11:54.974 --> 11:56.799
We all walk the dog.

11:56.799 --> 12:00.485
Your phone rings, someone tells you
your husband's raping someone.

12:00.485 --> 12:03.160
- Then what?
- I went back to sleep.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.481
- You didn't call the phone company?
- I went back to sleep.

12:06.481 --> 12:08.019
You didn't tell your husband?

12:08.019 --> 12:11.224
We don't both have to be awake
for a harassing phone call.

12:11.224 --> 12:13.107
- But he was here?
- Yes.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.173
I called the phone company this morning.

12:15.173 --> 12:16.872
Did they offer to put a trap on your line?

12:16.872 --> 12:19.530
Yes. But my husband doesn't want that.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.495
They could listen to
our personal conversations.

12:21.495 --> 12:24.877
And he's involved with
private financial matters.

12:24.877 --> 12:27.182
This woman is ruining our lives.

12:27.182 --> 12:29.651
Why don't you stop her?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.834
- Check Cleary's phone records?
- What we're doing.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.348
Mrs. Cleary alibi her husband?

12:34.348 --> 12:36.469
Yeah, but she was choking on it.

12:36.765 --> 12:40.593
Okay, Mrs. Cleary notified the phone
company after each harassing call.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.904
They all track to pay phones.

12:41.904 --> 12:44.640
She said she ignored the first call
thinking it was a prank, right?

12:44.640 --> 12:47.157
- That's what she said.
- Just went back a month.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.488
Found a number in our case file.

12:49.488 --> 12:53.109
That first call came from
one of Cleary's victims...

12:53.109 --> 12:55.234
Harper Anderson.

12:56.027 --> 12:58.904
Looks like she's stalking him.
Sorry, Olivia.

13:04.224 --> 13:06.630
You should be at his place, not mine.

13:06.630 --> 13:09.829
Harper, you can't stalk Cleary.

13:09.829 --> 13:12.075
Stalking is illegal.

13:12.312 --> 13:14.501
I survey from a legal distance.

13:14.501 --> 13:18.633
Playing with semantics here
can be very dangerous.

13:25.186 --> 13:28.038
I saw him go into the alley.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.655
By the time I got to it, he was gone.

13:30.820 --> 13:32.221
And I saw the fire escape.

13:32.221 --> 13:34.901
- Did you see him on the fire escape?
- No.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.993
But it's how he got into
my place to rape me.

13:37.993 --> 13:40.885
But you didn't see him go up it.
You didn't see him rape anyone.

13:40.885 --> 13:42.597
No. / And yet you called 911.

13:42.597 --> 13:44.333
First I circled the building to make sure

13:44.333 --> 13:46.532
that there was no way
I could've missed him.

13:46.532 --> 13:49.951
Then I thought about the probability
that he was raping someone.

13:49.951 --> 13:52.252
Then I called 911.

13:54.151 --> 13:55.517
Why didn't you stick around?

13:55.517 --> 13:59.718
Because he ran out the service entry right
after the sirens.

14:00.580 --> 14:05.694
I considered waiting for you guys,
but I've been down that road.

14:05.694 --> 14:08.220
So I shadowed him.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.378
Shadowed him?

14:09.378 --> 14:12.441
Not to be confused with stalked.

14:12.646 --> 14:17.643
And this is art not to be confused
with obsession or a target?

14:19.583 --> 14:21.939
It goes with the room.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.775
- Have some wine.
- We're working.

14:24.938 --> 14:27.826
6:00 p.m. Work day's done.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.760
You can have a glass of wine.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.511
No, thank you.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.256
He's a workaholic.

14:34.256 --> 14:36.995
He won't leave the office till 8:00.

14:36.995 --> 14:40.596
We can chat for another hour and a half.

14:42.227 --> 14:44.734
You couldn't identify him in a lineup.

14:44.734 --> 14:47.192
How do you know he's the man
that raped you?

14:47.192 --> 14:51.636
I was at his sentencing for
possession of stolen property.

14:51.636 --> 14:54.081
When he left the court...

14:54.081 --> 14:55.987
he winked at me.

14:56.590 --> 14:59.099
Winked.

15:01.489 --> 15:05.654
So who did he rape this time?

15:06.430 --> 15:07.984
He raped someone.

15:07.984 --> 15:10.259
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

15:11.948 --> 15:16.373
- Maybe a Scotch. Vodka?
- No, thank you.

15:16.373 --> 15:18.345
You don't have to be so tense.

15:18.345 --> 15:20.495
I don't expect anything from you.

15:20.495 --> 15:22.611
We did everything that we could.

15:22.611 --> 15:24.903
You couldn't ID him,
so we couldn't hold him.

15:24.903 --> 15:26.429
You could have followed him.

15:26.429 --> 15:27.868
You knew he would rape again.

15:27.868 --> 15:31.106
I'd like to follow every guy that I know
that has a propensity to rape.

15:31.106 --> 15:33.657
Poor police. So overworked!

15:33.657 --> 15:36.108
Harper, you're not equipped
to deal with this.

15:36.108 --> 15:39.028
I'm equipped.
I don't approach him.

15:39.028 --> 15:41.235
I'm doing what
any private investigator would do

15:41.235 --> 15:43.844
and I don't need a license to
do it for myself.

15:43.844 --> 15:46.508
- You're harassing his wife.
- Give me a break!

15:46.508 --> 15:48.738
She's enabling a rapist.

15:48.738 --> 15:52.619
And you're too busy to deal with him,
so I will.

15:59.763 --> 16:01.315
Harper Anderson is dangerous.

16:01.315 --> 16:03.996
- I'm not certain that she's dangerous.
- She's stalking Cleary.

16:03.996 --> 16:07.141
He raped her. She's following him
to catch him at it.

16:07.141 --> 16:10.323
We almost got him on the Lori Thatcher
rape because of her.

16:10.323 --> 16:14.123
You buy into her distinguishing
between stalking and following?

16:14.123 --> 16:15.497
The system failed her

16:15.497 --> 16:18.619
so she's operating it herself
as best she can.

16:18.619 --> 16:20.462
I mean, Cleary doesn't know
that she's there.

16:20.462 --> 16:22.664
She doesn't approach him,
she doesn't threaten him.

16:22.664 --> 16:24.841
Mrs. Cleary feels threatened.

16:24.841 --> 16:28.300
Sooner or later she has to face the fact
that her husband's a rapist.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.944
Why? She doesn't have to face it
unless we prove it.

16:30.944 --> 16:33.387
And we don't want her pushed there
by Harper Anderson.

16:33.387 --> 16:35.891
Street justice is always bloody.

16:35.891 --> 16:39.891
Munch, Fin, bring Harper in here
for a blunt talking-to.

16:39.891 --> 16:42.073
Captain... / No, you're too close to her.

16:42.073 --> 16:44.296
You and Elliott get in the Clearys' faces.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.243
Let them know we're onto them.
It may not go to making a case

16:47.243 --> 16:51.215
but I want to diffuse this tinderbox
before it blows.

16:54.118 --> 16:56.553
Elliott, look!

17:00.299 --> 17:02.183
Those are mine!

17:02.399 --> 17:04.877
You stop it!
You stop it right now!

17:04.877 --> 17:06.329
Get out! / You can't do this!

17:06.329 --> 17:08.190
Get out! / You can't do this!

17:08.190 --> 17:09.660
My son will see these!

17:09.660 --> 17:11.354
He'll know where he comes from.

17:11.354 --> 17:13.747
- You bitch!
- You're sleeping with a rapist.

17:13.747 --> 17:15.422
- Mrs. Cleary...
- Get out of my neighborhood!

17:15.422 --> 17:18.222
- You're enabling a rapist.
- Harper, stop it!

17:18.222 --> 17:20.365
- Mrs. Cleary, listen to me. Calm down.
- Take a breath, okay?

17:20.365 --> 17:21.674
What's going on?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.098
- She's putting these everywhere.
- Detective Stabler.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.763
Yeah. / Look.

17:24.763 --> 17:27.010
Two nights ago, a woman was raped.

17:27.010 --> 17:28.334
I was home with my wife.

17:28.334 --> 17:31.355
You're lying. I saw you.

17:31.588 --> 17:33.881
Every time a woman is raped
you're going to come to me?

17:33.881 --> 17:35.621
Not every time, no.

17:35.621 --> 17:39.190
How long do I have to bear the brunt
of this woman forgetting to take her lithium?

17:39.190 --> 17:41.465
She's obviously damaged.

17:44.335 --> 17:46.011
Hey! Hey. / Hey!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.699
Drop it.

17:47.884 --> 17:49.527
Don't make me cuff you.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.780
Perfect! Arrest me!

17:52.117 --> 17:54.680
Not the rapist.

18:06.421 --> 18:09.178
Office of Assinstant District Attorney
Alexandra Cabot
Tuesday, October 24

18:09.178 --> 18:11.503
We have anything else
on Lori Thatcher's rape?

18:11.503 --> 18:12.955
She could do a voice ID.

18:12.955 --> 18:15.600
But Cleary ain't coming down here
to see us on his own.

18:15.600 --> 18:16.844
We need probable cause.

18:16.844 --> 18:19.743
Harper can place Cleary exiting
Lori Thatcher's building.

18:19.743 --> 18:21.337
Her building, not her apartment.

18:21.337 --> 18:24.817
After that stunt Harper pulled with
Cleary's car, she's zero as a witness.

18:24.817 --> 18:27.335
And there's still the problem
of Harper stalking Cleary.

18:27.335 --> 18:29.676
Harper's taking control of her own life.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.055
Please.

18:31.055 --> 18:33.509
As long as Cleary's out there,
so's his next victim.

18:33.509 --> 18:36.166
He'll stay out there until
we can make a case.

18:36.350 --> 18:39.246
We need to pick up where Harper left off.

18:40.255 --> 18:41.789
I'm all for that.

18:41.789 --> 18:45.232
I can't authorize overtime to follow Cleary.

18:47.257 --> 18:49.511
Anyone asking for it?

18:50.054 --> 18:52.943
Are you with us?
He's likely to call in lawyers.

18:52.943 --> 18:56.721
If you don't interfere with his conducting
his life, I'll field any motion he files.

18:56.721 --> 18:58.029
Bingo.

18:58.207 --> 19:01.947
Miro Venture Capital
130 West 31st Street
Tuesday, October 24

19:03.680 --> 19:05.786
- So you take care of that part of it.
- Okay.

19:05.786 --> 19:09.662
Don't forget.
What are you doing here?

19:10.544 --> 19:12.389
We're going to go see your boss.

19:12.389 --> 19:14.043
Got a problem with that?

19:14.043 --> 19:16.164
No. No.

19:16.164 --> 19:19.093
Around the corner on the left.

19:23.910 --> 19:26.259
We're investigating a serial rapist.

19:26.259 --> 19:29.212
What can you tell us about Kenneth Cleary?

19:29.212 --> 19:30.919
What's he have to do with that?

19:30.919 --> 19:32.706
Is he a good employee?

19:32.706 --> 19:34.779
Is he involved in a rape?

19:35.476 --> 19:37.853
What's he like to work with?

19:38.041 --> 19:39.603
He's a workaholic.

19:39.603 --> 19:41.810
One of our top earners.

19:41.810 --> 19:43.335
So he works late?

19:43.335 --> 19:46.449
He's here when I arrive
and he is here when I leave.

19:46.449 --> 19:49.491
We lost two assistants who couldn't
keep up with him in Philadelphia.

19:49.491 --> 19:51.320
We're opening a branch there.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.560
He go there a lot?

19:52.560 --> 19:55.058
Spends half his time there.

19:55.805 --> 19:58.355
You think he raped someone?

19:59.461 --> 20:02.909
He has a misdemeanor conviction
for possession of stolen property.

20:02.909 --> 20:05.351
He spend the night in Philly?

20:05.933 --> 20:07.610
Yes.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.402
We have a corporate apartment.

20:09.402 --> 20:12.430
Could we see his travel records?

20:21.305 --> 20:24.367
Had to tell the boss I was convicted
on possession of stolen property?

20:24.367 --> 20:26.574
- Public record, pal.
- You're trying to get me canned?

20:26.574 --> 20:29.817
I brought the company
in $58 million last quarter.

20:29.817 --> 20:31.840
He'll live with a misdemeanor conviction.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.765
And a rapist?

20:33.765 --> 20:37.990
Let me ask you something,
one hungry man to another.

20:37.990 --> 20:42.093
Is there anything better than gorging
on a fresh caught meal?

20:44.073 --> 20:46.786
You won't be eating out anymore.

20:53.531 --> 20:54.976
Going back six months.

20:54.976 --> 20:57.866
Three rapes in Philadelphia
have Cleary's signature.

20:57.866 --> 20:59.968
June 13.

21:00.862 --> 21:03.461
He was there. The 10th to the 20th.

21:03.461 --> 21:05.822
August 26?

21:05.822 --> 21:08.468
There, the 23rd to the 28th.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.297
- September 15.
- There.

21:11.523 --> 21:13.559
They got him booked
on Amtrak to go there tomorrow.

21:13.559 --> 21:17.290
- Who booked to go where?
- Cleary to Philadelphia.

21:17.290 --> 21:18.856
Then you're going too, John.

21:18.856 --> 21:20.551
What a coincidence. Why?

21:20.551 --> 21:22.984
You found rapes that match
Cleary's M.O.?

21:22.984 --> 21:26.120
Three. / You're interviewing
the victims face to face.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.305
Something wrong with the facts?

21:28.305 --> 21:31.925
Philadelphia's SVU is under review for
dumping rapes as unfounded.

21:31.925 --> 21:34.377
So, yes, there's absolutely
something wrong with the facts.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.333
I don't trust them.

22:08.776 --> 22:09.888
There he is.

22:10.075 --> 22:12.387
Hey, Ken Cleary.
A little jumpy this morning?

22:12.387 --> 22:14.789
Love to talk, Det. Munch,
but I've got a train to catch.

22:14.789 --> 22:17.026
Yeah, Philadelphia club car.

22:17.026 --> 22:18.412
We're going coach.

22:18.412 --> 22:21.695
But if you feel the need to talk to me,
I'm willing to upgrade.

22:21.695 --> 22:23.677
What's the agenda here, gentlemen?

22:23.677 --> 22:26.060
- You trying to make me crazy?
- Hell, no.

22:26.060 --> 22:28.009
Way too late for that.

22:28.009 --> 22:29.731
And you are?

22:29.731 --> 22:32.551
The knot in the pit of your stomach.

22:32.551 --> 22:36.420
Hate to disappoint you. But I don't
mind the company or the attention.

22:36.420 --> 22:39.864
So there's no need to ask.
Is this how you like it?

22:44.200 --> 22:48.107
Pennsylvania Station

22:54.180 --> 22:55.122
What have we got?

22:55.122 --> 22:59.640
A list and description of jewelry stolen
during rapes, matching the Cleary M.O.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.096
Three here, three in Philadelphia.

23:01.096 --> 23:03.128
Munch just faxed these from the Philly P.D.

23:03.128 --> 23:04.383
For what purpose?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.756
Show Mrs. Cleary.
See if she has any of these pieces.

23:06.756 --> 23:09.740
If she's an accessory, she'll deny it.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.841
What are the odds that
she's an accessory to rape?

23:11.841 --> 23:14.726
I agree, they're remote.
The odds are that she's in denial.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.235
Who wouldn't be?
But it's still risky.

23:16.235 --> 23:18.543
What about the issue of spousal privilege?

23:18.543 --> 23:20.897
I'm not going to ask her
anything about her husband's rapes.

23:20.897 --> 23:22.968
I'm going to show her that list.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.107
If she's unwittingly in possession
of stolen property

23:25.107 --> 23:28.755
it might turn up the heat at home.
We've pressed him at work.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.604
We've run out of plays to make here.

23:30.604 --> 23:32.674
- So, what, a Hail Mary?
- Okay.

23:32.674 --> 23:34.257
She's going to be defensive.

23:34.257 --> 23:36.278
I'm sensitive to that.

23:36.278 --> 23:38.265
And you are?

23:38.265 --> 23:41.149
Taking some quasi-personal time.

23:42.278 --> 23:45.022
I called Harper last night because
I felt like I dropped the ball with her

23:45.022 --> 23:47.356
- so I'm going to meet her for coffee.
- Where?

23:47.356 --> 23:49.349
Westside Range.
I'll see you later.

23:49.349 --> 23:51.655
You're meeting her at firing range?

23:51.655 --> 23:54.026
I know. She's permitted.

23:54.441 --> 23:56.940
Special Victims Unit
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Wednesday, October 25

23:56.940 --> 23:59.588
Detectives Munch and Tutuola
are from New York City.

23:59.588 --> 24:02.144
They may have a lead on
the man who raped you.

24:02.511 --> 24:06.334
I know it's difficult but if
you can tell your story again.

24:09.857 --> 24:12.435
I woke up choking on a pillow.

24:12.435 --> 24:15.028
He told me to keep my eyes closed...

24:15.028 --> 24:16.655
and then he took the pillow out of the case

24:16.655 --> 24:19.351
and held the pillow case over my eyes.

24:19.351 --> 24:21.848
He held my T-shirt over my eyes.

24:21.848 --> 24:25.434
He pulled my nightshirt over my face
so I couldn't see him.

24:25.434 --> 24:28.575
He asked, "Is this how you like it?"

24:28.575 --> 24:30.396
"Is this how you like it?"

24:30.717 --> 24:33.525
"Is this how you like it?"

24:35.190 --> 24:38.211
After he raped me, he made me shower.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.315
My hot water was broken.

24:40.315 --> 24:42.399
He washed me.

24:43.585 --> 24:46.872
He had me in a cold shower...

24:46.872 --> 24:50.686
washing his semen off me.

24:50.886 --> 24:56.425
I asked him if his mother knew
what he was doing.

24:57.813 --> 25:02.415
He said his mother just wanted him
to be happy.

25:06.536 --> 25:10.504
- Mrs. Cleary, Detective Stabler.
- I don't want to talk to you.

25:11.412 --> 25:13.198
Mrs. Cleary...

25:13.198 --> 25:16.440
rape victims aren't just the women
who are attacked.

25:16.440 --> 25:22.108
Rape victims include their families
and the rapist's families.

25:22.263 --> 25:23.683
I am not a victim.

25:23.683 --> 25:27.039
And I don't want you standing on my stoop
shouting "rape" through my door.

25:27.039 --> 25:28.205
Yes, ma'am.

25:28.205 --> 25:29.456
You're harassing me.

25:29.456 --> 25:32.189
Destroying my family.
When does this stop?

25:32.189 --> 25:33.901
Right now.

25:34.789 --> 25:36.991
This is a list of jewelry and
the dates they were taken

25:36.991 --> 25:38.965
during rapes we suspect your husband in.

25:38.965 --> 25:40.194
My husband makes money.

25:40.194 --> 25:42.454
He doesn't need to steal
to give me jewelry.

25:42.454 --> 25:45.535
I'm talking about a sickness here,
Mrs. Cleary.

25:45.723 --> 25:48.807
Serial rapists very often take items

25:48.807 --> 25:51.000
so that they can look at them
and remember.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.673
Your trophies, like your jewelry...

25:53.673 --> 25:56.487
allow your husband to relive the rapes

25:56.487 --> 26:02.146
so that he can become excited.
I am sorry to put you through this.

26:02.307 --> 26:07.316
I know this is a terrible ordeal for you
but it is worse for the victims.

26:08.158 --> 26:12.279
And quite frankly,
I don't know where else to turn.

26:18.085 --> 26:20.827
I won't bother you again.

26:34.196 --> 26:35.958
Nice grouping.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.803
What are you using?

26:38.803 --> 26:41.661
.50 caliber, double action Desert Eagle.

26:41.661 --> 26:43.401
14-shot clip.

26:43.401 --> 26:46.481
Took me a month to learn
how to hold it level.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.326
This sucker's nearly 40 ounces
with a full load.

26:49.326 --> 26:52.834
Harper, a 14-round clip is illegal
in New York.

26:53.185 --> 26:54.373
Here.

26:54.373 --> 26:56.280
Didn't know that.

26:56.442 --> 26:58.670
Eight is plenty.

27:00.165 --> 27:02.806
That gun's pretty extreme.

27:03.024 --> 27:04.065
Why?

27:04.065 --> 27:06.369
A.50 caliber semi-auto
with a 14-round clip?

27:06.369 --> 27:08.094
It's practically an assault rifle.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.320
I just gave you the clip.

27:10.644 --> 27:13.032
You're something else.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.431
- What?
- You think I'm Velma Vigilante...

27:16.431 --> 27:20.856
stalking Cleary, waiting for
the perfect moment to shoot him?

27:20.856 --> 27:22.187
That's not who I am.

27:22.187 --> 27:24.167
You're not the same person
I knew six months ago.

27:24.167 --> 27:25.940
I was a rape victim when you met me.

27:25.940 --> 27:29.403
I finally have control over my life back.

27:30.045 --> 27:32.361
I'm not interested in revenge.

27:32.361 --> 27:35.832
I'm not even interested in justice anymore.

27:35.832 --> 27:38.404
Then why follow Cleary?

27:39.111 --> 27:43.236
Because I'm afraid of him,
and he's the last thing I'm afraid of.

27:43.236 --> 27:48.396
If I can get over that I will
have my life back completely.

27:49.952 --> 27:52.245
You want to go for a drink?

27:54.228 --> 27:57.392
There's a little Spanish place
around the corner.

27:57.621 --> 27:58.994
Tapas and Sangria?

27:58.994 --> 28:02.694
I would have bet the new old Harper
to be a Whiskey Park girl.

28:02.694 --> 28:07.159
I haven't cruised a chichi date bar
since I was raped.

28:10.918 --> 28:14.679
- I was just writing you a note.
- Really?

28:14.679 --> 28:18.717
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

28:19.737 --> 28:22.642
You didn't do it, Mrs. Cleary.

28:22.642 --> 28:25.768
But you said I was enabling a rapist.

28:25.768 --> 28:29.487
- I shouldn't have.
- He's my husband.

28:29.695 --> 28:33.393
I feel responsible for...

28:33.393 --> 28:37.934
I feel guilty.
I want you to know that.

28:38.963 --> 28:41.929
What made you change your mind?

28:55.469 --> 28:58.372
My husband has always
surprised me with his

28:58.372 --> 29:01.351
no-special-occasion gifts.

29:01.351 --> 29:04.648
A silver ring next to my coffee cup.

29:04.835 --> 29:08.933
That opal ring on my pillow.

29:09.564 --> 29:13.533
He'd get so excited when I tried them on.

29:13.763 --> 29:17.086
I thought it was romantic.

29:17.651 --> 29:20.873
- Six of the pieces match.
- The rest?

29:21.089 --> 29:24.594
He gave them to me the same way.
Don't want them.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.580
Did your husband ever discuss with you
how he came by the jewelry?

29:27.580 --> 29:30.107
Don't answer that. Spousal privilege.

29:30.107 --> 29:31.703
Excuse me for a moment.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.166
- Do you want some privacy?
- No.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.476
I'll just take a second.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.119
I can't take it.

29:42.119 --> 29:44.767
I can't take it.
Come home.

29:44.767 --> 29:48.938
No, you have to come home now.

29:55.703 --> 29:59.233
He'll be on the next train from Philadelphia.

30:04.184 --> 30:06.246
I can't tolerate any more of this.

30:06.246 --> 30:08.937
You follow me to work,
you follow me to Philadelphia. Fine.

30:08.937 --> 30:12.038
But you make my wife hysterical and that,
my friends, will cost you.

30:12.038 --> 30:14.168
I'm gonna call my lawyer and
the Police Commissioner.

30:14.168 --> 30:15.925
You might want to stick
with just your lawyer for now.

30:15.925 --> 30:18.954
Kenneth Cleary, you're under arrest.

30:18.954 --> 30:20.446
You have the right to remain silent.

30:20.446 --> 30:23.648
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

30:23.648 --> 30:24.998
You have the right to an attorney.

30:24.998 --> 30:27.914
If you cannot afford an attorney one
will be appointed...

30:39.040 --> 30:40.200
Are you ready?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.692
Yes.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.448
Can I close my eyes?

30:43.448 --> 30:44.703
Yes.

30:45.282 --> 30:49.214
Would you have them each say,
"Is this how you like it?", please.

30:51.093 --> 30:53.264
Is this how you like it?

30:53.698 --> 30:55.722
Is this how you like it?

30:56.285 --> 30:58.192
Is this how you like it?

30:58.761 --> 31:00.327
Is this how you like it?

31:00.327 --> 31:01.473
It's him.

31:01.654 --> 31:03.294
It's him.

31:13.106 --> 31:15.084
Very entertaining.

31:15.084 --> 31:18.478
How many more shows are there today?

31:21.125 --> 31:22.639
Is this how you like it?

31:23.672 --> 31:25.395
Is this how you like it?

31:25.866 --> 31:27.721
Is this how you like it?

31:28.525 --> 31:30.343
Is this how you like it?

31:30.343 --> 31:31.971
Bastard.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.645
That's him.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.573
That's him. It's Number 4.

31:38.148 --> 31:39.706
We have one more.

31:39.706 --> 31:43.167
I don't have to be here.
I'm sure your report will be accurate.

31:43.167 --> 31:45.615
See you in court.

31:48.393 --> 31:50.824
Arraignment Court Part 69
Friday, October 27

31:50.824 --> 31:53.777
"File number 492276."

31:53.777 --> 31:55.596
"People verses Kenneth Cleary."

31:55.596 --> 31:57.762
"One count rape in the first degree"

31:57.762 --> 32:00.354
"one count sexual abuse in the first degree"

32:00.354 --> 32:02.810
"one count robbery in the second degree"

32:02.810 --> 32:07.398
"and three counts criminal possession
of stolen property in the fifth."

32:07.996 --> 32:09.444
Quite a list.

32:09.444 --> 32:11.618
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

32:11.618 --> 32:13.995
Exactly how much we planning
to charge the defendant

32:13.995 --> 32:15.606
to get out of jail, Ms. Cabot?

32:15.606 --> 32:16.991
Remand without bail, Your Honor.

32:16.991 --> 32:18.630
Put away your claws, Counselor.

32:18.630 --> 32:21.694
My client is not a flight risk.
He's a pillar of the community.

32:21.694 --> 32:23.937
If you define pillar as a seven-figure salary.

32:23.937 --> 32:25.976
And if he can afford you,
he can afford to fly.

32:25.976 --> 32:28.721
Mr. Cleary is willing to surrender
his passport, Your Honor.

32:28.721 --> 32:30.237
Your Honor, he is a menace to women.

32:30.237 --> 32:32.319
His crimes are not confined
to the State of New York.

32:32.319 --> 32:36.177
The People have had my client under
surveillance even across state lines.

32:36.177 --> 32:39.120
Their continued harassment
should assuage their fears.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.985
- Is that true, Ms. Cabot?
- No.

32:41.985 --> 32:45.798
SVU detectives went to Philadelphia
to interview Mr. Cleary's victims.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.315
- Objection.
- Be quiet.

32:49.321 --> 32:51.453
I still need a number.

32:51.453 --> 32:54.421
$500,000.

32:54.627 --> 32:57.925
- Let's double that.
- No objection.

33:00.909 --> 33:03.247
Is that the best you could do?

33:03.247 --> 33:05.359
You shouldn't be here, Mrs. Cleary.
You're my witness.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.964
I thought maybe there was
a chance I was wrong.

33:07.964 --> 33:10.378
I saw how he looked at you, and I knew.

33:10.378 --> 33:12.840
We should get together soon
so I can prep you before the trial.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.241
I'm staying with my family in Long Island.

33:15.241 --> 33:17.301
Is there anything I can do for you now?

33:17.301 --> 33:19.498
You know a good divorce lawyer?

33:20.978 --> 33:23.397
I don't know if she can do this.

33:23.397 --> 33:25.193
A moment, Ms. Cabot.

33:26.426 --> 33:29.140
I'm Harper Anderson, Mr. Klein.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.515
Your client raped me.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.945
I know how famous you are.

33:33.945 --> 33:35.558
Yes?

33:35.738 --> 33:38.128
You're going to burn in hell.

33:38.128 --> 33:42.080
I'm Jewish, Miss Anderson.
There is no hell.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.175
Excuse us.

33:46.289 --> 33:48.696
Save me the bedtime reading.
How many motions are you filing?

33:48.696 --> 33:53.801
Omnibus. In limine, to suppress,
and spousal privilege.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.022
- See you in judge's chambers.
- Yeah.

33:58.299 --> 34:01.597
Chambers of Judge Margaret Barry
Monday, October 30

34:01.597 --> 34:03.927
Spousal privilege is inviolate.

34:03.927 --> 34:06.305
Discovery was made through the wife.

34:06.305 --> 34:10.772
Give me a good reason not
to throw out the jewelry.

34:10.772 --> 34:12.494
It doesn't fall under privilege.

34:12.494 --> 34:15.367
Nobody asked Cleary's wife
where he got the jewelry.

34:15.367 --> 34:17.429
Would anyone care for lemon?

34:18.011 --> 34:22.690
Communication between a husband
and wife is not limited to speech.

34:22.690 --> 34:27.574
The police went to the Cleary home
with the express purpose of discovery.

34:27.574 --> 34:30.610
They should have handed
the list to Mr. Cleary.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.068
He would have turned over the items.

34:33.068 --> 34:36.034
He gets his gifts from various sources,
which he would have revealed.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.400
But in an effort to disrupt his family

34:38.400 --> 34:43.011
the police went to his wife to induce her
to violate spousal privilege.

34:43.011 --> 34:44.605
The court can't support that.

34:44.605 --> 34:46.306
The jewelry has to be excluded.

34:46.306 --> 34:47.637
The police did not ask Mrs. Cleary

34:47.637 --> 34:50.208
any questions regarding
her husband's activities.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.310
They presented her with the list
of stolen items.

34:52.310 --> 34:54.851
She discovered she had several
pieces of jewelry on that list.

34:54.851 --> 34:58.032
- And she turned them in.
- Please, Ms. Cabot.

34:58.032 --> 35:01.829
Don't you consider him giving
her jewelry an activity?

35:01.829 --> 35:04.933
Limit the scope to receipt
of the jewelry and by whom.

35:04.933 --> 35:06.823
- But Your Honor, it's...
- Next item.

35:06.823 --> 35:08.091
Voice ID.

35:08.091 --> 35:11.181
This is a stretch under the best of
circumstances.

35:11.181 --> 35:16.468
But a terrified victim hearing the
breathless voice of an aroused perpetrator

35:16.468 --> 35:18.937
during the commission of a violent act?

35:18.937 --> 35:20.872
I don't think so.

35:20.872 --> 35:25.757
You'll have your chance to undermine
the identification during cross.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.177
More tea?

35:27.527 --> 35:29.825
Supreme Court Trial Part 78
Friday, November 3

35:29.825 --> 35:32.229
That's how I knew it was him.

35:34.416 --> 35:35.837
Thank you.

35:39.542 --> 35:42.937
You identified the man
who raped you, is that correct?

35:42.937 --> 35:46.586
Yes. Kenneth Cleary.

35:46.768 --> 35:49.677
But you didn't actually see him, did you?

35:49.677 --> 35:52.440
No. / You identified him
by voice, is that correct?

35:52.440 --> 35:53.809
Yes.

35:53.809 --> 35:56.347
I'd know that voice anywhere.

36:00.524 --> 36:02.068
Is this how you like it?

36:02.068 --> 36:05.656
Do you recognize this voice,
Ms. Thatcher?

36:06.181 --> 36:07.866
No.

36:07.866 --> 36:11.386
- I can play it again.
- Objection. Asked and answered.

36:11.386 --> 36:13.407
Hearing this surprised the witness,
Your Honor.

36:13.407 --> 36:16.997
Maybe she'd like to hear it again
to make sure. / Go ahead.

36:18.364 --> 36:20.257
Is this how you like it?

36:20.257 --> 36:23.027
Do you recognize the voice?

36:23.027 --> 36:25.553
- Does it sound vaguely familiar?
- Objection.

36:25.553 --> 36:27.533
- He's badgering.
- Sustained.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.004
Yes, Your Honor.

36:29.004 --> 36:31.470
The man on the tape is a co-worker.

36:31.470 --> 36:34.473
You talk to him every day.

36:35.391 --> 36:38.871
Robert. / You don't recognize his voice,
how can you recognize...

36:38.871 --> 36:40.273
Objection!

36:40.273 --> 36:44.716
Sustained. Back off, Mr. Shoenfeld.

36:56.702 --> 36:59.385
How did you come into possession
of this garnet necklace?

36:59.385 --> 37:01.304
It was a gift from my husband.

37:01.304 --> 37:03.215
- He gave it to me...
- Wait for the next question.

37:03.215 --> 37:05.637
Your answers need to be
very narrow and very specific.

37:05.637 --> 37:10.937
Why are you only asking about how
I came into possession of the jewelry?

37:10.937 --> 37:13.263
I can't ask about anything else.

37:13.263 --> 37:15.521
Why not?

37:15.969 --> 37:19.700
Communication between husband
and wife is inadmissible.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.799
It's as privileged as priest and supplicant.

37:22.799 --> 37:26.958
You aren't going to ask me about
how excited he got when I wore them?

37:26.958 --> 37:31.835
How he insisted I wear them
before we had sex? / I can't.

37:31.835 --> 37:35.956
I wish I could but I'm not allowed
to ask about that.

37:35.956 --> 37:37.340
Do you understand?

37:37.340 --> 37:39.218
The jewelry is important, Mrs. Cleary.

37:39.218 --> 37:41.819
Because we need to connect
the timeline to the rapes

37:41.819 --> 37:43.398
so that your husband
won't be able to duck

37:43.398 --> 37:47.733
by claiming that he purchased swag
from some guy on Canal Street.

37:47.733 --> 37:52.874
- He wants joint custody of our son.
- And he's not going to get it.

37:52.874 --> 37:57.057
- If he gets off...
- One thing at a time, okay?

37:58.211 --> 37:59.465
Okay.

37:59.934 --> 38:03.518
How did you come into possession
of this garnet necklace?

38:03.518 --> 38:05.682
My husband gave it to me.

38:05.682 --> 38:09.624
- Was it a special occasion?
- No.

38:09.832 --> 38:12.661
Do you remember
when he gave it to you?

38:12.661 --> 38:16.590
Kenneth gave it to me on his return
from a business trip to Philadelphia.

38:16.590 --> 38:18.755
- September 6.
- Objection.

38:18.755 --> 38:23.169
The witness couldn't possibly remember
the dates of every gift she received.

38:23.169 --> 38:27.002
Mrs. Cleary, how is it that
you recall this date?

38:27.002 --> 38:29.818
It was our son's first day of kindergarten.

38:29.818 --> 38:32.729
Kenneth made sure he was home for that.

38:32.729 --> 38:36.671
He left the necklace on my pillow
the night before.

38:36.671 --> 38:38.186
Overruled.

38:38.186 --> 38:40.944
Did you know this necklace belongs
to a woman who was raped

38:40.944 --> 38:44.848
- on September 5 in Philadelphia?
- Objection. Relevance.

38:44.848 --> 38:46.567
Sustained.

38:46.745 --> 38:51.166
You're on thin ice Ms. Cabot.
Stick to the scope.

38:52.532 --> 38:57.428
Mrs. Cleary, do you recognize this ring?

39:00.790 --> 39:02.270
I do.

39:02.270 --> 39:05.341
And do you remember how you
came into possession of it?

39:05.341 --> 39:07.907
My husband gave it to me.

39:07.907 --> 39:10.993
- Do you remember when?
- Yes.

39:10.993 --> 39:15.720
I remember because we were
dressing for a charity event.

39:15.720 --> 39:21.155
He asked me to try it on
and then he got so excited,

39:21.155 --> 39:22.971
he had to have sex with me.

39:22.971 --> 39:23.836
Objection.

39:23.836 --> 39:25.496
- He'd get so excited...
- Mrs. Cleary, stop.

39:25.496 --> 39:28.026
if I wouldn't have sex with him
he'd masturbate. / Objection.

39:28.026 --> 39:30.507
- Mrs. Cleary...
- You had me wear your trophies...

39:30.507 --> 39:34.799
so that you could get off?
You sick, twisted bastard!

39:34.799 --> 39:36.855
I move for an immediate mistrial.

39:36.855 --> 39:40.711
The witness is clearly hysterical
and has done irreparable harm to the jury.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.157
Granted.

39:42.963 --> 39:46.268
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

39:46.268 --> 39:48.795
You are excused.

39:49.003 --> 39:50.656
I'm sorry.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.233
Approach.

39:52.233 --> 39:54.940
I'm so sorry.

40:00.026 --> 40:03.870
I hold you responsible, Ms. Cabot.

40:03.870 --> 40:07.159
You knew the limits set before you.

40:07.159 --> 40:09.231
You prepped your witness.

40:09.231 --> 40:14.245
You knew she was in a severe
and emotional state

40:14.245 --> 40:18.381
and you now have the pleasure
of starting over.

40:18.381 --> 40:20.392
In the interim...

40:20.392 --> 40:26.357
I sincerely hope you acquire
some professionalism.

40:38.614 --> 40:41.625
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

40:55.868 --> 40:58.173
You're not having any?

40:58.173 --> 41:00.308
AA.

41:03.141 --> 41:05.055
How are you holding up?

41:05.055 --> 41:07.807
I felt like I was 10 years
old today getting yelled at

41:07.807 --> 41:11.007
for playing in my mother's make-up.

41:15.044 --> 41:17.821
- We can't do this again.
- Why?

41:17.821 --> 41:19.532
We've got no case.

41:19.532 --> 41:23.260
The dream team blew holes
in the victim's IDs. And Mrs. Cleary...

41:23.260 --> 41:25.985
I think she sabotaged us on purpose.

41:25.985 --> 41:28.393
What would she hope to
gain by doing that?

41:28.393 --> 41:29.780
I don't know.

41:29.780 --> 41:33.291
Kenneth Cleary walks,
and the People get a black eye.

41:33.291 --> 41:36.492
So it's all about you?

41:36.926 --> 41:38.506
I don't need this, Cragen.

41:38.506 --> 41:39.615
No?

41:39.615 --> 41:43.338
While you're whining about your case
seems you forgot about Harper Anderson

41:43.338 --> 41:45.196
Lori Thatcher, the women in Philly.

41:45.196 --> 41:48.964
- Don't forget Mrs. Cleary.
- The biggest victim of all.

41:49.361 --> 41:51.498
You think she suffered more than
her husband's victims?

41:51.498 --> 41:55.476
She has to deal with him the rest
of her life. She has his son.

41:55.476 --> 41:57.232
What?

41:59.967 --> 42:02.478
We're on our way.

42:03.406 --> 42:06.425
I just came by to get
a few things for my son.

42:06.425 --> 42:09.871
He hit me.
Kept hitting me.

42:09.871 --> 42:13.538
She didn't have a choice.
He wouldn't stop.

42:20.403 --> 42:22.768
- Who tried to clean up?
- I did.

42:22.768 --> 42:27.817
Meredith was hysterical. She didn't
want the blood to seep into the floor.

42:27.817 --> 42:31.052
Does it make a difference?

42:31.799 --> 42:33.425
You know it does, Harper.

42:33.425 --> 42:36.137
Bleach ruins the gunshot residue test.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.032
Really?

42:38.504 --> 42:40.732
Who shot him?

42:43.140 --> 42:45.604
Who shot him?

42:45.604 --> 42:47.547
I did.
