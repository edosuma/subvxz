00:04.637 --> 00:07.272
(sighs) charlie?

00:09.509 --> 00:11.076
(exhales)

00:11.078 --> 00:13.512
You expecting someone else?

00:17.584 --> 00:19.585
I love you.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.653
I love you, too.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.327
But, charlie, just...
Lately I feel like

00:28.329 --> 00:30.396
There's this distance
between us.

00:32.550 --> 00:35.549
Check out  www.DDLValley.eu       for the latest tv shows, movies & more

00:37.704 --> 00:39.738
Charlie?

00:39.740 --> 00:42.041
(gasps, exhales sharply)

00:42.043 --> 00:44.443
(siren wailing in distance)

00:44.445 --> 00:47.279
(exhales deeply)

00:47.281 --> 00:52.084
(indistinct conversations)

00:52.086 --> 00:54.553
(both speaking indistinctly)

00:54.555 --> 00:55.621
Gettin' off?

00:55.623 --> 00:58.157
What? No! Yes, sorry.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.391
I fell asleep
in the call room.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.526
Weird dream.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.761
Mm, weird.
Now I want details.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.363
Forget about it.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.597
Hearing other people's dreams
is like trying to listen

01:05.599 --> 01:07.699
To the daily special
at a restaurant.

01:07.701 --> 01:08.767
People just glaze over.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.270
Okay.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.771
Hey, guys.
Hey...

01:12.773 --> 01:15.240
How are you doing?
Good. Thank you.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.308
Nice suit.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.643
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm, uh,

01:17.645 --> 01:19.611
Supposed to do
this photo shoot for the, uh,

01:19.613 --> 01:22.214
Hospital newsletter.
Spotlight on the chief.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.683
I just hate having
my picture taken, you know?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.118
Key to a good photo...

01:26.120 --> 01:27.686
(cell phone buzzing)
think of a secret.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.488
I don't have any secrets.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.523
(buzzing continues)
luke called.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.791
What's he want?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.860
He's speaking tomorrow
at a sunrise meeting.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.595
Invited us, so...

01:36.597 --> 01:39.631
Okay. Well,
I wouldn't miss that.
I gotta take this. Sorry.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.266
(speaks indistinctly)
it's his testimonial.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.801
He's gonna be telling
a room full of strangers

01:42.803 --> 01:44.136
All about my crazy family.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.171
I'll be right there
beside you.

01:46.173 --> 01:49.374
You do make good arm candy.
Eh.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.243
Is there anything
in my teeth?

01:51.245 --> 01:52.444
Why? You got a hot date?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.614
No. I have my own camera
to worry about.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.249
Okay, you have
one more cup of coffee,

01:57.251 --> 01:58.817
We're gonna have
to get out the tripod.

01:58.819 --> 01:59.885
Okay. Shut up.
(slaps)

01:59.887 --> 02:01.286
(chuckles)
start talking.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.255
(clears throat)

02:03.257 --> 02:05.557
Hello, gentle youtubers.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.560
I am the artist
currently known as "riley."

02:08.562 --> 02:10.696
And I've been documenting
my transition

02:10.698 --> 02:14.166
From female to male
ever since I was 16.

02:14.168 --> 02:17.803
And today I get
my bottom surgery done.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.272
(chuckles) which--
yeah, so--

02:20.274 --> 02:21.573
And I'm here with my mom.

02:21.575 --> 02:25.344
And, oh, my righteous
psychiatrist, dr. Murphy.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.678
Ah... (chuckles)

02:26.680 --> 02:28.380
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes
kind of guy.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.682
Here.
Is this a script?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.718
(chuckles) you wish.
It's the consent form.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
I signed yours.
Now you have to sign mine.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.855
Or else, forever be covered
in a blue dot.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.191
Well, hello.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.559
Hey.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.394
So I hear you landed
on the name "riley."

02:42.396 --> 02:43.829
I like it. It suits you.
Mm-hmm.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.765
Okay, but does it--
I mean, does it say... Boy?

02:46.767 --> 02:47.866
(whispers) yes.
Yeah?

02:47.868 --> 02:49.268
Okay, good. Because I--

02:49.270 --> 02:51.537
I want to go stealth
from now on, so...

02:51.539 --> 02:55.307
Okay, I know that this
is a very exciting day for you.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.475
Yeah, well,
that's an understatement.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.310
Okay. But we need to go over

02:58.312 --> 02:59.578
Some important pre-op stuff
first.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.313
I'll see you after
the surgery.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.615
I'll be sure to come up with
appropriately pithy sound bites.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.785
(chuckles)
hey, no uterus jokes. <i>Period.</i>

03:06.787 --> 03:08.320
Huh?
(chuckles)

03:08.322 --> 03:10.489
Okay. So your hysterectomy/
oophorectomy

03:10.491 --> 03:12.524
Isn't as visible
as your mastectomy.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.226
But it is a radical procedure.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.827
Okay. Well, radical
is the way I roll.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.363
Along with the obvious
negation of fertility,

03:18.365 --> 03:20.299
The sudden change
in hormone levels

03:20.301 --> 03:21.900
Can carry
severe side effects.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.535
Wow. (chuckles)

03:23.537 --> 03:25.771
I mean, you're killing
my buzz here, doc.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.773
Well...
That's the way I roll.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.442
Slowed metabolism,
loss of bone density--

03:30.444 --> 03:32.244
You need to prepare
for that.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.378
(whispers) okay.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.646
(normal voice)
I mean, I-I-I get it.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.316
But, uh... (inhales deeply)
in a few hours,

03:37.318 --> 03:38.483
I'm going to feel

03:38.485 --> 03:40.385
More like myself
than I've ever felt.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.655
And    <i>nothi</i>can kill
that buzz. (chuckles)

03:43.657 --> 03:46.258
(chuckles) see,
you're such a guy.
(chuckles)

03:46.260 --> 03:48.293
See you later.
Okay.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.995
(inhales deeply, groans)

03:49.997 --> 03:52.331
Jana raymond--she was, uh,
jumping on a trampoline

03:52.333 --> 03:54.399
When she fractured
her left proximal tib/fib.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.468
Ugh, not gonna let my kids
anywhere near

03:56.470 --> 03:57.603
One of those death traps.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.539
(chuckles)
well, she's actually 39.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.275
A mature trampolinist.
Awesome.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.244
(curtain rings clack)
(woman) you seem to be
doing really well.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.913
Hello, jana.
I am dr. Harris.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.682
Um... Wow!

04:10.684 --> 04:12.884
So a trampoline injury.
Were you, um...

04:12.886 --> 04:14.686
Are you a gymnast?
(chuckles) uh, no.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.022
I like food too much for that.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.558
You, uh,
jumping with your kids?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.694
No. Single, childless,
and not a gymnast.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.564
Should be
my online dating profile, right?

04:25.566 --> 04:26.832
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

04:26.834 --> 04:29.368
Can you, um, feel that?
(voice breaks) mm-hmm.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.037
Does that hurt?
(strained voice)
like a son of a bitch.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.472
Okay.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.340
So what were you doing
on the trampoline then?

04:35.342 --> 04:36.842
Scaled my neighbor's fence
this morning

04:36.844 --> 04:40.612
That's funny. Most people just
steal their neighbor's wi-fi.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.448
I'm not most people.
Yeah, I'm getting that.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.549
I'm gonna need to do
a closed reduction.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.418
So we better
sedate you first.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.487
Oh, no. I don't--
no drugs.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.988
I don't want any drugs,
please.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.423
Is that a religious thing?

04:51.425 --> 04:54.926
No. No religion. No.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.430
I have a lot of stuff
I have to do

04:58.432 --> 05:00.065
In the next few hours.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.634
So I don't really want to be
stoned for any of it.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.803
Well, you're gonna need
something to manage the pain.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.907
Okay, just give me
as little as... (exhales)

05:08.909 --> 05:10.542
Possible to get through it.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.477
Okay. Let's do, um,

05:12.479 --> 05:15.681
50 micrograms of fentanyl,
rambo.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.850
Okay. 50 it is.
That's... It.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.519
There you go.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.922
Uh, you're gonna need me
for countertraction.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.023
Yeah.
Yeah.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.058
<i>Wow.</i>

05:26.060 --> 05:28.660
This stuff works really fast.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.862
Well, this is still
gonna hurt.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.465
And...
(strained voice) three!
(cracks)

05:33.467 --> 05:37.936
Aah! (laughs)

05:37.938 --> 05:39.538
All right.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.406
You let me know if she needs
any more brown sugar.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.941
Thank you, hip-hop.

05:42.943 --> 05:48.780
I'm going to take you up
for a post-reduction x-ray.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.916
Really? Can't you just
give me some crutches

05:50.918 --> 05:53.685
And let me go?
I've got a lot of stuff to do.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.020
I think
that can probably wait.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.490
No. It can't. Really.
I-I've got until midnight.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.791
Why, what happens
at midnight?

05:59.793 --> 06:03.495
You, uh, turn into
a pumpkin like cinderella?

06:03.497 --> 06:06.531
It was her <i>carriage</i>
<i>that turned into a pumpkin.</i>

06:06.533 --> 06:07.966
And you're avoiding
the question.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.868
You'll think I'm nuts.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.505
Miss raymond,
what happens at midnight?

06:13.507 --> 06:17.042
(sighs) I'm gonna die.

06:18.811 --> 06:23.515
By midnight tonight
I'll be dead.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.420
â™ª

06:28.422 --> 06:31.490
-- Captions by vitac --

06:32.125 --> 06:35.427
And during the surgery,
don't go further than there.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.828
And keep to my left.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.165
'cause that's my good side.
(singsongy) thank you.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.933
(woman sighs) I'm shaking.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.804
No. I'm just
so excited for you.
(chuckles)

06:45.806 --> 06:49.174
Everything goes smoothly,
he'll be home tom--tomorrow.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.610
(knock on door,
monitor beeps)

06:52.545 --> 06:55.013
(alex)
excuse us for a second.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.481
What do you have?

06:56.483 --> 06:58.850
Riley's pre-op c.T.
(sighs)

06:58.852 --> 07:03.522
There's a mass density here
in the retroperitoneal area.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.557
Look like a sarcoma to you?

07:05.559 --> 07:06.925
It's hard to tell.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.862
Anything retroperitoneal
I usually refer immediately.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.731
Could it be
castleman's disease?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.667
No. He has no history
of h.I.V. Or herpes.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.003
What about desmoid tumors?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.771
Aren't desmoids super rare?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.474
Yeah. But if it is
desmoid tumors and we cut...

07:22.476 --> 07:23.642
They'll multiply.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.877
We can't risk it.

07:25.879 --> 07:29.548
I don't know how
I'm going to tell him.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.020
Hey.
And there's
the beautiful surgeon

07:35.022 --> 07:37.823
Ready to take out
the baby-maker.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.028
What's going on?
Why did you take that off?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.496
(sighs)

07:44.498 --> 07:47.766
Turn off the camera.

07:52.872 --> 07:56.174
(monitor beeping steadily)

07:56.176 --> 07:57.642
Is it cancer?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.778
We don't know that yet.
Oh, my god.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.514
I... (chuckles)
I don't care.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.715
Riley.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.784
I know how disappointing
this must be.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.185
No, no, no, no.
I'm serious.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.054
If--if I have cancer,
I want to have it as a man.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.556
Riley, removing
your uterus and ovaries

08:11.558 --> 08:13.258
Is an elective surgery.
No.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.161
For me it's not.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.796
I thought you said

08:17.798 --> 08:19.197
We were gonna see this
whole thing through together.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.232
We will.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.100
We just need
to put the brakes on

08:22.102 --> 08:23.802
Until I can biopsy the mass.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.238
I don't believe this.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.906
When will we know what it is?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.274
Soon, hopefully.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.210
In the meantime, you'll have
to go off your meds.
No.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.845
No, no, no, no.
Going off the "t," that's--

08:33.847 --> 08:36.047
That's not an option.
No. No.
Riley.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.649
Testosterone puts you
at a higher risk

08:37.651 --> 08:38.817
For certain types of cancer.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.152
So until we know exa--
of course.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.687
We'll stop.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.023
(reycraft) okay. Um...

08:45.025 --> 08:47.259
Dr. Reid will bring you
back up to the ward.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.694
Screw that.
I'm not leaving.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.263
Riley, listen to me.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.798
We will figure this out,
okay?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.700
I give you my word.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.671
(whispers)
we're in this together, right?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.876
(indistinct conversations)

09:05.878 --> 09:08.079
Jana, this is dr. Murphy.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.814
Are you from physio?

09:09.816 --> 09:12.250
No, actually, jana,
I'm a psychiatrist.

09:12.252 --> 09:16.955
Hoping to talk to you about what
you told dr. Harris earlier.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.057
I knew I should have kept
my mouth shut.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.593
It was the drugs
that made me loose-lipped.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.128
Jana, this is
kind of important.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.830
I need to know why you feel
like you want to hurt yourself.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.265
No. I don't <i>want</i> to die.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.201
I'm just fairly certain
that I'm going to...

09:30.203 --> 09:31.269
Tonight.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.138
Someone threaten you?
No.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.740
Something you heard
in the news?

09:35.742 --> 09:36.808
(sighs)

09:36.810 --> 09:38.610
Tomorrow is my birthday.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.345
The big 4-0.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.748
And it just so happens that
no woman in my family

09:43.750 --> 09:45.784
Has ever lived that long.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.986
A genetic condition?

09:47.988 --> 09:50.755
No. Mom died
of ovarian cancer.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.925
She was 39.
Her last words to me were...

09:53.927 --> 09:56.027
(whispers) <i>"vÃ¡monos."</i>

09:56.029 --> 09:58.697
(normal voice)
it means "let's go."

09:58.699 --> 10:00.031
That must have been hard.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.867
Mm, it was weird.
And then a few years ago,

10:02.869 --> 10:04.970
My only aunt died
in a car crash

10:04.972 --> 10:06.938
Just after
her 39th birthday.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.708
(inhales sharply)
and last March,

10:09.710 --> 10:12.177
My sister drowned
on a camping trip.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.180
Do you want to guess
how old she was?

10:15.182 --> 10:17.349
Jana, um...

10:17.351 --> 10:20.185
Three people dying doesn't mean
that it's a pattern.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.722
Actually, doctor,
I'm fairly certain that

10:23.724 --> 10:26.858
That's the definition
of a pattern.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.661
I am surrounded by death.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.163
Call me crazy.
(chuckles)

10:33.799 --> 10:36.368
She's not delusional.
She has an overvalued idea.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.870
If she was delusional,
she would know more specifics

10:38.872 --> 10:40.372
Like, "I'm going to get hit
with a bus

10:40.374 --> 10:41.906
At the corner
of first and main."

10:41.908 --> 10:43.875
Okay. So you're saying
she's not crazy then?

10:43.877 --> 10:46.378
Not a term I love to use,
but no.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.046
If I had to guess,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.348
I'd say this has something
to do with her mother's death.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.751
So what do we do? Tell her
it's all in her mind?

10:52.753 --> 10:55.353
No, actually...
The opposite.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.223
I think she needs to feel
that she's being heard.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.227
Okay. I'll order
a full-body c.T. Scan.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.429
(chuckles) didn't think
you'd jump on board so fast.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.798
Well, premonitions of death
may seem flakey, gavin,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.233
But I'd rather be
safe than sorry.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.269
How are you going
to justify a c.T.?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.704
Well, she was alone

11:12.706 --> 11:15.040
When she fell off
that trampoline, right?

11:15.042 --> 11:18.777
Who's to say she also
didn't hit her head?

11:19.979 --> 11:22.013
So his name is huell.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.348
Huell.
Yeah, that's right.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.350
What kind of a name is that?
Uh, it's welsh, I think.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.918
Look, I-it doesn't matter
anyways, he's--

11:26.920 --> 11:28.186
He's been my client
for six months.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.255
And he's just been doing
really, really good.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.324
He has a splendid
social worker.
(chuckles)

11:33.326 --> 11:34.726
Well, not today.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.027
I kind of have
a really big problem.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.262
What the <i>huell</i> happened?

11:37.264 --> 11:42.934
I need your help. He--he--
he spent 60 days at braxton.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.869
And we got him
right into sober living.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.004
And he's just, you know,
I mean, he's--

11:46.006 --> 11:47.405
He's been doing aces.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.140
I don't like
where this is going.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.209
Well, his brother died
out west.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.045
And he didn't have the money
to go to the funeral--
here we go.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.880
So he, um--
um, he had a drink,

11:55.882 --> 11:57.148
Which led to
an 8 ball of coke,

11:57.150 --> 11:58.917
Which he shot up
with a dirty needle.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.885
And he ended up with
a soft tissue infection

12:00.887 --> 12:02.020
In his left arm.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.822
A lymphangitic spread?
Yeah.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.724
I mean, his arm is--
it's a--it's a mess.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.058
But I got him
admitted last night.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.227
And I have a bed waiting
for him at selby house.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.262
Okay. It sounds like you have
everything under control here.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.832
So what is the problem?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.836
(voice cracks) well...

12:17.838 --> 12:19.838
Okay.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.076
Sonja?
Yeah.

12:25.078 --> 12:29.247
Where is your client?
Um, just...

12:33.319 --> 12:35.887
Huell?

12:35.889 --> 12:37.489
Huell, it's--it's--
it's okay. We're here.

12:37.491 --> 12:40.058
(huell, muffled voice)
wait, who's we?
Um, just--

12:40.060 --> 12:42.994
Just my friend joel and I.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.463
(mouths words) he's--

12:45.465 --> 12:47.832
Um, he's... A doctor.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.435
Can he get me some
narcotics?
(sighs)

12:50.437 --> 12:51.469
(chuckles)

12:51.471 --> 12:52.971
He's inside the wall?

12:52.973 --> 12:55.340
Okay. So joel, he just--
he went through the panel

12:55.342 --> 12:58.276
In the ceiling to try to find
a drug cabinet... To rob.

12:58.278 --> 13:03.081
And then, um... (chuckles)
uh, he got stuck.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.217
This is the problem
you needed my help with?

13:06.219 --> 13:09.454
Yeah. (chuckles)
it's...

13:09.456 --> 13:12.223
Joel. Joel, please.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.826
Huell, just...

13:14.828 --> 13:16.895
Hang tight, okay? Joel!

13:16.897 --> 13:19.063
I don't really have
a choice. Sonja...
Joel, please just--

13:19.065 --> 13:20.932
There is a junkie
in my wall.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.433
You know, I can't
endanger this hospital

13:22.435 --> 13:23.968
Just to accommodate
your--

13:23.970 --> 13:26.037
Granted very unfortunate--
but still criminal client.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.106
Look, he is on parole.
If you call the cops--

13:28.108 --> 13:30.241
The cops can't throw him
in jail for being stupid, right?

13:30.243 --> 13:32.343
No. They will put him
back in jail, joel.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.512
They will.
That's not really
my concern now is it, sonja?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.347
I'm so sorry, but...
Could you get

13:36.349 --> 13:37.949
The fire department
on the phone, please?
Look...

13:37.951 --> 13:39.417
I might be implicated
in this as well.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.586
Hold up one second.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.121
What do you mean you could be
implicated in this?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.256
Just... (chuckles)
(chuckles)

13:45.258 --> 13:47.258
Okay, look. So he called me
last night from a bar,

13:47.260 --> 13:49.527
And he was out of his mind
with grief and--

13:49.529 --> 13:50.895
And other things,
and he's--

13:50.897 --> 13:52.263
In clear violation
of his parole.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.399
Now, I--
okay, you were obliged
to report him.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.168
Which I didn't.
And I could lose my license.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.403
(lowered voice)
what do you want me to do?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.537
(lowered voice)
joel, just please--

13:59.539 --> 14:00.905
Please help me get him out

14:00.907 --> 14:03.474
Without anybody else finding
out. Please.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.109
I--but, sonja,

14:05.111 --> 14:07.011
I can't just start cutting
into hospital walls.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.947
I don't know his position
in there for one thing.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.448
I could do him
some serious harm here.
I know. But, joel,
I have to--

14:10.450 --> 14:12.016
I have to think about ryan.
I can't--

14:12.018 --> 14:14.886
(whispers)
I can't lose my job. Please.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.589
Please, I'm sorry.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.457
Slight change of plan here.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.626
Could you have a...

14:21.628 --> 14:25.530
Portable x-ray and a cast saw
sent to ward room 4, please?

14:25.532 --> 14:28.333
Joel! Did you get a chance
to review the case I sent you?
Alex.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.469
I have not had an opportunity.
I'm sorry, I've been sno--

14:31.471 --> 14:33.404
Al--alex. That's al--

14:33.406 --> 14:35.506
Crazy road trip alex?

14:35.508 --> 14:37.141
Wow! I was--

14:37.143 --> 14:40.144
I-I was just picturing
alex trebek.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.546
Oh. Sorry
to disappoint you.
(chuckles)

14:41.548 --> 14:44.015
(sonja chuckles)
so, alex,
this is, uh, sonja.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.917
Oh, hi!
Nice to meet you.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.186
So what's up?
Riley's c.T.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.388
Yeah.
I reviewed it with
the head of radiology.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.357
We both think that
there is a separation

14:52.359 --> 14:55.293
Between the uterus
and the mass.
Mm-hmm.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.194
Plan "b."

14:56.196 --> 14:57.929
She always has
a plan "b."

14:57.931 --> 14:59.297
I do the surgery
laparoscopically.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.132
Okay. What does reycraft say
about this?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.600
He's not confident
we can do it.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.369
And you are looking for someone
to say that you can.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.504
It's a little bit
of a minefield,

15:06.506 --> 15:07.538
I gotta say, alex.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.673
I know. (sighs)

15:08.675 --> 15:10.475
But looking at the c.T.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.944
If I could just get the scope
in there, I think that I--
but...

15:12.946 --> 15:14.078
(sighs) okay.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.246
This thing turns out
to be malignant.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.514
One little scratch
on that mass,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.349
He could be dead
in six months.
I know.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.319
It gets really distorted
in there sometimes. I mean...

15:21.321 --> 15:24.122
If you promise me
that you will bail

15:24.124 --> 15:25.356
At the first sign
of trouble.

15:25.358 --> 15:28.092
I'll be careful
not to step on any mines.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.496
(clicks tongue)
no cameras.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.197
Thank you.

15:33.199 --> 15:36.167
Nice to meet you.
Mm-hmm.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.404
Let's go cut down a wall.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.672
(sighs and whispers)
oh, god. Thank you, joel.

15:40.674 --> 15:41.973
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.975
9:00 is the earliest?

15:43.977 --> 15:46.644
Yeah, okay. No, great.
I'll take it.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.212
Thanks.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.114
I booked you a c.T.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.650
I just booked a table
at momofuku.

15:52.652 --> 15:53.685
Wanna join me?

15:53.687 --> 15:56.554
No. I have to work.
(sighs)

15:56.556 --> 15:59.657
Well, here's hoping I croak
before the bill comes then.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.193
You're not dying tonight,
jana.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.362
Not on your watch.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.664
Look, just get me
some crutches

16:06.666 --> 16:08.299
And get me out of here.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.969
I have ordered you
a full-body c.T. Scan.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.471
(sighs) there isn't time.
Jana...

16:13.473 --> 16:16.641
Do you have any idea
what it's like

16:16.643 --> 16:20.111
To be at death's door
and stuck in a... Hospital?

16:20.113 --> 16:22.413
Um, actually, I do.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.149
You have to listen
to this feeling--

16:25.151 --> 16:28.386
That something isn't right.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.556
Hey... I'm saying
I believe you.

16:31.558 --> 16:35.026
You said that with
a straight face.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.227
Well, I'm your doctor.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.096
It's my job to get
to the bottom of...

16:38.098 --> 16:39.297
Whatever this is.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.767
I am taking you seriously.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.636
So take me seriously.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.641
(alex) it feels like
we're in tiger country.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.710
We'll need to divide
these adhesions

16:52.712 --> 16:54.245
To see if we're good.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.580
Avoid touching that mass.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.515
You know the stakes.
Thanks for that.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.549
No pressure.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.751
His pressure is fine.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.120
I'm talking to reid.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.254
Get me closer, reycraft.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.256
I need to see this.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.159
There?
(monitor beeps)

17:09.361 --> 17:12.597
(alex) uh, damn.
Is that urine in the field?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.600
The bladder shouldn't be
that high up.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.468
Let's check it
with methylene blue.

17:17.470 --> 17:21.672
(monitor beeping)

17:21.674 --> 17:24.075
(beeps)

17:24.077 --> 17:26.277
Blue is leaking
into the cavity.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.645
There's your nick.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.213
(sighs)

17:29.215 --> 17:31.549
(clacks)
needle driver
and some 3-0 monocryl.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.718
(objects clatter,
monitor beeps)

17:33.720 --> 17:36.320
(alex speaks indistinctly)

17:39.658 --> 17:41.592
Okay.
(monitor beeps)

17:41.594 --> 17:44.629
(beeps)

17:44.631 --> 17:46.330
Is that
a purse string suture?

17:46.332 --> 17:48.366
Yep. I'm everting the edges

17:48.368 --> 17:50.101
To give better
wound approximation.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.235
Keep it simple, reid.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.770
Two stitches should do it.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.305
As long as it doesn't leak.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.241
(alex) okay,
what's the next move?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.576
(tom) we're done.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.446
No. No, no. I'm fixing it.
Let's keep rolling.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.314
You want to end up
in another m&m together?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.515
It's a minor complication.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.250
Just because
you're a little gun-shy--

18:06.252 --> 18:07.752
Lucky it's the bladder
and not the mass.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.321
Otherwise, he'd be
facing a death sentence.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.225
Can someone
deal with her, please?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.726
I can do this.
No.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.862
I can't believe I let you talk
me into this in the first place.

18:17.864 --> 18:18.796
Reycraft...

18:18.798 --> 18:20.131
It's too risky.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.700
Finish your suturing.
We're done.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.436
(beeps)

18:33.479 --> 18:43.221
(machine beeping steadily)

18:43.223 --> 18:44.355
What happened?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.723
There was a complication.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.692
Things became too risky,

18:47.694 --> 18:49.460
And we couldn't complete
your hysterectomy.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.463
This... This is a joke, right?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.699
Mom, tell me--tell me
you're punk'ng me.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.567
I'm so sorry, baby.

18:56.569 --> 19:00.438
Your small bowel is stuck
to your bladder and uterus.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.572
Things aren't in
the right place.

19:01.574 --> 19:05.376
Okay, listen--I know that you
really wanted this surgery.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.879
But it's not safe for you.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.714
(inhales, exhales)

19:09.716 --> 19:12.416
You know what, doctor? If you're
not gonna do this for me,

19:12.418 --> 19:14.418
I'm gonna find someone
on the internet who will.
You need to lay back, okay?

19:14.420 --> 19:15.820
No. No. No. Screw you!

19:15.822 --> 19:18.189
Okay, riley, I understand
that you're angry with me--

19:18.191 --> 19:19.891
You're friggin' right!
(clatters)

19:19.893 --> 19:23.461
Look, I trusted you!
You stay the hell away from me!

19:26.598 --> 19:28.332
Holly, I've never
seen him like this.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.835
Well, my uterus has made me
act pretty crazy at times, too.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.203
You?

19:32.205 --> 19:34.605
80 milligrams
of testosterone weekly

19:34.607 --> 19:36.607
Shouldn't affect
his behavior like this.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.776
We did just find out
that he might have cancer.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.745
Have you been monitoring
his hormones?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.847
He hates needles.
He gets me to inject them.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.649
And you're sure he's not getting
them from another source?

19:44.651 --> 19:47.752
Maybe double-dipping, maybe?
What?

19:47.754 --> 19:50.588
Could he be
hiding it from you?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.523
We don't have any secrets.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.358
I'm not making accusations.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.727
You kind of are.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.636
Hey, huell,
how you doing?

20:05.638 --> 20:07.371
(huell) I don't feel so good.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.639
(beeping)
I know. Just--just
hang in there, okay?

20:08.641 --> 20:10.408
Joel's just setting up
the x-ray machine.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.676
I just need to get a picture

20:11.678 --> 20:13.644
To see how you're positioned
in there, buddy.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.413
(huell) yeah.
Wouldn't wanna end up
cutting you in half.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.447
That--that'd be good.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.982
Sorry I messed up, sonja.

20:17.984 --> 20:21.619
Look, relapse, it's just--it's--
it's a normal part of recovery.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.554
(huell) sure is the fun part.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.623
We're gonna get you
out of there.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.924
(blows air)
give me your earrings.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.326
Sorry?
Your earrings.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.428
Uh, give 'em to me.
You'll get 'em back.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.431
So listen, I mean,
you and, uh... Trebek,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.700
You--you--
you used to date?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.268
We did. Yeah.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.936
Did you cohabitate?

20:38.938 --> 20:40.338
Momentarily.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.306
And, um...

20:42.308 --> 20:44.242
She's, uh,
she's single now?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.310
No.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.012
And we're just friends.
Come on.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.547
(jacket thuds)

20:52.251 --> 20:53.251
Hit the lights.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.819
Okay.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.721
(light switch clicks,
machine clicks)

21:01.793 --> 21:03.694
(clicks)

21:03.696 --> 21:04.929
(buzzes)

21:04.931 --> 21:05.930
(beeps)

21:05.932 --> 21:06.931
Oh...

21:06.933 --> 21:08.266
(joel) wow.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.801
Wow, he's...

21:10.803 --> 21:11.836
Really stuck in there.

21:11.838 --> 21:15.039
(huell) yeah, guys, my arm's
really hurting now.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.741
What are you doing? Guys?
Uh...

21:16.743 --> 21:18.843
Okay, it's like,
there are my earrings.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.678
Yeah. Um...

21:20.680 --> 21:23.848
Okay. Um, let's
use that as a landmark.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.316
And then we'll, um,

21:25.318 --> 21:27.518
We'll cut 2 inches
above that one there.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.620
Huell, can you move your arm?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.056
No. Uh, n-no, I can't.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.692
It's--it's pinned under me.
It's starting to kill.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.993
What?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.662
Joel?

21:38.864 --> 21:40.731
What--what's wrong?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.566
If he loses circulation
with a lymphangitic infection,

21:42.568 --> 21:46.504
He could go septic
really, really fast.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.306
We've gotta get him
out of there.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.373
Uh...

21:49.375 --> 21:52.643
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

21:56.615 --> 22:00.351
Well, if it isn't
crocodile dundee.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.920
He's australian,
not a kiwi.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.624
Give us a hug.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.759
Come here. Come here.
Aah.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.494
Good, man.
You been demoted, or what?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.629
You wanna restock
my tongue depressors?

22:11.631 --> 22:12.897
Yeah, it looks like it,
doesn't it?

22:12.899 --> 22:14.699
Hey, man, I hear
congrats are in order.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.400
You're, uh, you're speaking
at a sunrise meeting tomorrow,

22:16.402 --> 22:17.902
Or something?
Yeah. A sunrise meeting.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.338
Mm-hmm.
In the old days,
the only time I'd see a sunrise

22:20.340 --> 22:21.672
Is from the back of a cruiser.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.507
(cell phone vibrates)
ooh.

22:25.043 --> 22:28.579
Yeah. I have...

22:28.581 --> 22:31.082
A photographer
all set up in my office.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.650
Cool. A photo shoot.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.884
You know the key
to doing a good photo, right?

22:33.886 --> 22:35.052
Yeah, alex has already
briefed me on that.

22:35.054 --> 22:38.622
Let me ask you something.

22:38.624 --> 22:41.492
Does this look like
it'll cut through a wall?

22:41.494 --> 22:42.793
Aah.
Hey.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.562
I haven't discharged you.
What are you doing?

22:44.564 --> 22:45.730
He found a doctor in aruba

22:45.732 --> 22:47.398
Who's willing
to do his surgery.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.766
I've tried to talk sense
into him.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.401
He just--he won't hear it.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.736
So, riley,
this is what you want?

22:51.738 --> 22:53.537
You want some internet hack
to operate on you?

22:53.539 --> 22:55.005
This is dangerous.
No. No.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.475
No, I...

22:57.477 --> 22:58.976
I wanted you to do it,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.611
But it... I mean, it doesn't
look like that's gonna happen.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.146
So I have to do
what I have to do.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.515
You just had surgery. You need
to stay here in the hospital.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.117
And you,
you need to talk to him,

23:06.119 --> 23:08.886
And you need to--
hey, no, no.
Don't you dare! Don't you--

23:08.888 --> 23:10.821
Oh.
Riley...

23:10.823 --> 23:13.524
This was not her decision.
It was mine, okay?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.860
She's my... She's my...
I understand that, but you
need to try and relax.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.962
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.463
You don't question her, okay?
Riley, can you try
to stay calm, please?

23:19.465 --> 23:22.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Riley!

23:27.906 --> 23:29.907
Ms. Stiles, your daughter
has suffered a heart arrhythmia.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.709
He's my son.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.811
I'm just going
by the chart.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.647
Uh, riley, have you been
taking anything

23:36.649 --> 23:37.848
Other than
your testosterone?

23:37.850 --> 23:41.185
E.C.G. Shows
left ventricular hypertrophy.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.820
A sign of steroid abuse.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.723
Which also explains
your behavior.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.725
I don't have roid rage.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.961
I mean, you weren't
gonna do my surgery.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.030
I might have cancer.
I was upset.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.601
You went through my stuff?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.203
Hey, that's an invasion
of privacy.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.604
There are enough steroids
in here

24:00.606 --> 24:02.106
To supply
the tour de France.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.809
I mean, so...

24:04.811 --> 24:06.777
Steroids are barely even
illegal anymore.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.447
Oh, no.
They're very illegal.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.881
I was trying to bulk up.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.151
I mean, it's hard to gain
muscle mass when you're a vegan.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.586
Where did you
get them from?

24:15.588 --> 24:17.855
Off some guy at my gym.

24:25.564 --> 24:29.467
Your c.T. Scan results,
jana.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.768
You're all clear.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.036
So I'm not gonna die?

24:32.038 --> 24:35.940
Mm, no, you're gonna die.
In about, um...

24:35.942 --> 24:37.775
Oh, 55 years.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.810
(laughs)

24:39.812 --> 24:41.145
I guess this is
good-bye, then.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.680
No. You're wrong again.

24:42.682 --> 24:44.782
I gotta do a follow-up
on that leg in about six weeks.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.518
Sure.
(elevator bell dings)

24:47.520 --> 24:50.187
<i>VÃ¡monos,</i> dr. Harris.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.589
(telephone ringing in distance)

24:51.591 --> 24:54.024
Good-bye, jana.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.693
(button clicks)

24:58.530 --> 25:01.765
(radio chatter)

25:08.540 --> 25:09.940
(clatters)

25:11.943 --> 25:13.077
(charlie) jana!

25:14.946 --> 25:15.946
Jana.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.548
Come inside.

25:17.550 --> 25:18.549
Why?

25:18.551 --> 25:21.652
(breathing heavily)

25:21.654 --> 25:22.920
'cause you don't
want to do this.

25:22.922 --> 25:26.223
I didn't come up here
to jump.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.260
It's the perseid meteor shower.

25:29.262 --> 25:31.662
Happens every year
in August,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.964
And it was
on my bucket list.

25:33.966 --> 25:37.835
(man) â™ª you've got light
in the darkness â™ª

25:37.837 --> 25:38.769
Oh.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.038
Wow.
Look at that.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.707
Did you see that?

25:43.709 --> 25:46.777
Yeah. Ol' perseid
puts on quite a show.

25:46.779 --> 25:51.582
Nothing like a wonder
to make you wonder.

25:51.584 --> 25:52.583
About what?

25:52.585 --> 25:55.119
â™ª in our eyes

25:55.121 --> 26:00.691
Do you--do you believe that
there's something, you know...

26:00.693 --> 26:01.859
Afterward?

26:01.861 --> 26:07.331
â™ª show the way
to the darkness â™ª

26:07.333 --> 26:09.867
You know, if you'd asked me
that question a year ago,

26:09.869 --> 26:11.969
I probably would have
told you no.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.704
â™ª for the darkness

26:13.706 --> 26:14.872
I'm asking you now.

26:14.874 --> 26:16.273
You're not dying tonight,
jana.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.708
(scoffs)

26:17.710 --> 26:19.944
Just answer the question.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.282
Yeah.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.850
Maybe.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.955
Maybe there's something more.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.990
(siren wailing in distance)

26:32.992 --> 26:36.327
You knew
about the steroids.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.995
The hell are you
talking about?

26:37.997 --> 26:41.932
Couple of videos go viral,
and now you're a stage mom?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.367
You think
I care about that?

26:43.369 --> 26:47.204
All I know is that when I asked
him where I got the drugs from,

26:47.206 --> 26:49.039
He looked at you.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.909
I know this must
seem crazy to you.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.644
It does.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.946
I was just trying
to be supportive.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.948
I didn't want to
mess up... Again.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.683
What are you talking about?

26:59.685 --> 27:02.820
Riley was born...

27:02.822 --> 27:04.088
With both parts.

27:04.090 --> 27:08.826
He had both female
and male reproductive organs?

27:08.828 --> 27:11.795
Well, there was nothing
in his medical files

27:11.797 --> 27:13.864
About a variation
of sex development.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.232
The doctor recommended
that we wait

27:15.234 --> 27:19.336
To see which gender he grew up
to identify with.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.672
But I couldn't.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.907
I thought if I chose,

27:23.909 --> 27:27.244
His life would be... Easier.

27:27.246 --> 27:30.047
Better.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.182
And I wanted a girl,
so...

27:34.819 --> 27:37.054
Does riley have any idea?

27:38.089 --> 27:40.090
He was a baby.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.827
We had the surgery,
and I just buried it.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.896
Never told him.

27:52.370 --> 27:55.005
(whirring)

27:55.007 --> 27:58.142
Are we the only business
that still uses a fax machine?

28:00.011 --> 28:02.279
Who's elizabeth stiles?

28:02.281 --> 28:04.114
My f.T.M. Patient riley.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.717
These are his 20-year-old
medical records.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.218
What are we looking for?

28:08.220 --> 28:11.221
Riley was born with both
male and female parts.

28:11.223 --> 28:13.824
His mother's kept it a secret
from him all these years.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.859
That's heavy.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.861
When he started to identify
as male,

28:17.863 --> 28:18.929
She must have felt
pretty guilty

28:18.931 --> 28:20.264
For making the wrong call.

28:20.266 --> 28:23.267
At 3 months old, he has
a feminizing genitoplasty

28:23.269 --> 28:24.735
And is raised as a girl.

28:24.737 --> 28:26.070
He also had a pelvic surgery

28:26.072 --> 28:29.840
To remove abnormal ovarian
tissue during feminization.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.210
We need to confirm
with immunohistochemistry,

28:33.212 --> 28:37.147
But that fibroblastic tissue
is not a tumor at all.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.850
It's 20-year-old
scar tissue.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.851
Are you gonna tell him?

28:40.853 --> 28:42.953
Someone has to.

28:43.755 --> 28:45.823
(tape ripples)

28:48.359 --> 28:49.359
Lights.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.495
Yeah. Great.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.163
(click)

28:53.165 --> 28:54.832
(click)

28:59.070 --> 29:00.170
Cute.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.272
Let's get
this party started.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.174
(saw whirs)

29:04.176 --> 29:06.877
(huell) hail mary,
full of grace,

29:06.879 --> 29:07.878
The lord is with thee...

29:07.880 --> 29:11.115
(saw whirring)

29:13.818 --> 29:16.120
What time is it?

29:16.122 --> 29:18.288
Um...
Actually, no. No.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.125
Don't tell me.
I don't--I don't wanna know.

29:26.364 --> 29:29.800
My hand is sweaty.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.402
Well... So's mine.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.977
(cell phone button clicks)

29:42.347 --> 29:43.847
Happy birthday.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.916
12:01.
Mm-hmm.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.819
Really?
Yep.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.287
Feel good to be wrong?

29:50.289 --> 29:53.223
Yeah. So good.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.028
Oh. Oh.

29:58.030 --> 29:59.396
What?
Oh, no.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.931
What?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.966
The last 24 hours
just came flooding back to me.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.103
I... I made an epic scene
at work.

30:06.105 --> 30:09.006
I maxed out
all my credit cards.

30:09.008 --> 30:12.176
I think I actually
might be a fugitive.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.312
Thank you.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.482
For what? I didn't do anything
but fix your bum leg.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.055
Yeah.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.327
You did.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.967
Take care of yourself,
jana.

30:38.269 --> 30:41.238
(whirring)

30:43.408 --> 30:44.408
(whirring stops)

30:44.410 --> 30:45.976
(exhales)

30:45.978 --> 30:47.244
Let's move this stuff.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.179
Right. Uh...

30:49.181 --> 30:51.248
Here, and help me
grab this mattress.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.482
You got it.

30:57.223 --> 31:01.225
All right, huell.
Almost there.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.227
(huell) good, 'cause I am
starting to freak out in here.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.562
I--I can't breathe. Sonja...
Sonja, are you still there?
Yeah? It's okay?

31:05.564 --> 31:07.531
I think so.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.566
Um...

31:09.568 --> 31:11.068
Okay. Give it a push, mate!

31:11.070 --> 31:13.203
Just--but... Be careful!

31:13.205 --> 31:15.339
Yeah.

31:15.341 --> 31:16.907
Uhh!

31:16.909 --> 31:20.177
I-I get morphine
for this, right?

31:20.179 --> 31:22.045
Oh, god.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.914
Huell. You okay?

31:23.916 --> 31:25.449
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh, god.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.017
(knocks)

31:27.019 --> 31:29.052
Riley?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.587
I have some news for you.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.089
I've booked an o.R.,

31:32.091 --> 31:33.657
And we're gonna go ahead
with your hysterectomy...

31:33.659 --> 31:35.492
Unless you'd rather go
to aruba.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.028
(laughs)

31:38.030 --> 31:39.563
You better not be
messing with me, doc.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.200
I'm not. We'll do the open
procedure as originally planned.

31:43.202 --> 31:47.037
Oh. I don't understand.
What--what changed?

31:47.039 --> 31:48.405
The mass we discovered
in your pelvis--

31:48.407 --> 31:51.141
Turns out it was scar tissue
from a previous surgery.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.945
But I... I've only ever had
two surgeries--

31:54.947 --> 31:57.481
My--my wisdom teeth
and my mastectomy.

32:01.119 --> 32:03.020
He should hear it from you.

32:03.955 --> 32:07.024
I can't.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.258
Please.

32:10.361 --> 32:14.131
Riley, the scar tissue was from
a gender assignment surgery

32:14.133 --> 32:15.499
You had as a baby.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.634
You had both female
and male genitalia.

32:17.636 --> 32:21.038
You were assigned female
at birth.

32:21.639 --> 32:24.675
What?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.977
No.

32:26.979 --> 32:30.280
No. No. You...
You decided for me?

32:32.150 --> 32:33.450
I was trying
to protect you.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.452
How... How could you?

32:35.454 --> 32:36.987
I love you.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.189
You lied to me.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.091
What was I
supposed to tell you?

32:41.093 --> 32:43.527
(voice breaking) the truth.

33:01.312 --> 33:05.349
(indistinct conversations)

33:05.351 --> 33:07.150
Jana.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.052
What are you still
doing here?

33:09.054 --> 33:10.354
Thought I kicked you out.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.422
Well, I guess
you're a hard guy to leave.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.658
Well, I told you
this isn't good-bye.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.326
Need to see that--

33:18.229 --> 33:19.463
Where's your cast?

33:21.132 --> 33:24.568
Oh. I...
I don't know. I was just...

33:28.506 --> 33:31.575
(breathing heavily)

33:35.446 --> 33:36.713
Okay.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.053
(zach) again.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.721
(zach) come on.

33:44.723 --> 33:46.590
<i>Huh.</i>

33:46.592 --> 33:50.127
(zach breathing heavily)

33:56.601 --> 33:59.569
"natural causes."

33:59.571 --> 34:03.607
What's natural about a healthy
39-year-old dropping dead?

34:03.609 --> 34:05.542
You never know when
it's gonna be your time.

34:05.544 --> 34:08.211
<i>Oh, I did.</i>

34:08.213 --> 34:09.479
Did she, uh, mention

34:09.481 --> 34:12.549
Being under any physical
or emotional stress?

34:12.551 --> 34:16.420
She had premonitions
of her own death.

34:16.422 --> 34:20.123
Uh, she was working off
a bucket list.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.491
Sudden arrhythmic death
syndrome

34:21.493 --> 34:23.527
Affects the electrical
functioning of the heart,

34:23.529 --> 34:26.463
But there are no
structural abnormalities.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.498
So it wouldn't have showed up
on any scan?

34:28.500 --> 34:29.699
No.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.169
Looks like a self-fulfilling
prophecy to me.

34:32.171 --> 34:34.404
<i>Damn it.</i>

34:34.406 --> 34:37.174
Don't, uh,
have the body removed.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.775
Charlie...

34:38.777 --> 34:41.311
I'm--I'm her doctor.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.313
I'll look after it,
okay?

34:47.852 --> 34:50.654
(machine beeping steadily)

34:51.689 --> 34:53.190
Hi.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.461
Your surgery
was a success.

34:59.797 --> 35:02.365
Thank you.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.135
Welcome to the world,
mr. Riley stiles.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.737
(laughs)

35:10.208 --> 35:11.441
I'm going off shift.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.310
Is there anything you need
for comfort?

35:13.312 --> 35:15.345
Ginger ale? "gq"?

35:16.881 --> 35:18.315
Is she still here?

35:18.317 --> 35:21.118
She's been pacing outside
the whole time.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.152
(whispers)
can you get her for me?

35:22.154 --> 35:23.220
Of course.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.688
Thank you.

35:31.529 --> 35:33.263
How you feeling?

35:33.265 --> 35:35.732
Uh, crampy.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.733
Last time.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.468
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

35:49.180 --> 35:51.648
I love you.
You know that, right?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.383
Well, duh.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.784
(laughs)
(laughs)

35:54.786 --> 35:58.188
It's just--I... I think it's
just gonna take some time.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.390
I'm not going anywhere.

36:00.392 --> 36:04.194
I mean, it's an exciting day.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.396
And I want my mom here for it.

36:12.236 --> 36:13.904
Oh.

36:13.906 --> 36:16.840
This...
This came for you.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.486
It's my student card.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.791
You look handsome...

36:34.793 --> 36:36.359
Son.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.898
(inhales, exhales)

36:41.900 --> 36:44.267
I'm sorry, jana.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.969
<i>For what?</i>

36:45.971 --> 36:47.904
For not saving your life.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.473
<i>You did the best you could.</i>

36:50.475 --> 36:52.475
<i>I mean, you listened to me.</i>

36:52.477 --> 36:54.311
<i>You believed in me.</i>

36:56.914 --> 37:00.951
You're gonna be
going away soon.

37:00.953 --> 37:02.452
<i>Will you stay with me?</i>

37:02.454 --> 37:04.421
<i>I mean, just till I do?</i>

37:04.423 --> 37:08.258
<i>Girl shouldn't be alone</i>
<i>on her birthday.</i>

37:08.260 --> 37:10.827
Yeah, I'm still
your doctor.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.462
I'm not going anywhere.

37:17.468 --> 37:20.537
<i>Interesting feeling, this.</i>

37:20.539 --> 37:24.674
<i>Kind of like bouncing</i>
<i>on a trampoline.</i>

37:24.676 --> 37:26.676
<i>Just suspended.</i>

37:33.251 --> 37:35.752
I think I'm losing
my mind.

37:38.356 --> 37:40.957
<i>My mother learned</i>
<i>to speak spanish</i>

37:40.959 --> 37:44.861
<i>From these old records that</i>
<i>she bought at a flea market.</i>

37:44.863 --> 37:47.931
<i>She was fun, too.</i>

37:47.933 --> 37:53.536
<i>Anyway, the one that she</i>
<i>used to sing to me,</i> "vÃ¡monos,"

37:53.538 --> 37:57.274
<i>Was about this woman</i>
<i>who runs off with an outlaw</i>

37:57.276 --> 37:59.676
<i>To a place where they...</i>

37:59.678 --> 38:02.979
<i>Where they won't be judged</i>
<i>for who they are.</i>

38:02.981 --> 38:06.916
So is this who I am?

38:08.853 --> 38:10.920
<i>Who else is there to be?</i>

38:14.325 --> 38:15.992
VÃ¡monos.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.401
(horns honking in distance)

38:24.403 --> 38:25.969
No sepsis.
Hey.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.637
Soft tissue infection's
clearing up nicely.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.572
Just a slight contusion
from...

38:29.574 --> 38:32.609
(sighs) from--from when he
fell out of a wall?

38:32.611 --> 38:35.545
Yes, but he should be good
to move to selby house

38:35.547 --> 38:37.447
In just a day or two,
so yeah.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.015
Oh, joel...

38:39.017 --> 38:40.016
Thank you.

38:40.018 --> 38:41.751
It was just a wall.

38:41.753 --> 38:45.755
So, um, how was--how was
the big glamour shoot?

38:45.757 --> 38:48.491
According to alex,
the key to a winning photo

38:48.493 --> 38:49.893
Is to be thinking
of a secret.

38:49.895 --> 38:53.496
So all I had to do
was think of today's escapades,

38:53.498 --> 38:55.932
And it was...
I had a secret.

38:55.934 --> 38:59.569
Anyway, I think we should
celebrate. I'm starving.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.371
Uh, I'm thinking, like,

39:01.373 --> 39:03.940
Late night/early morning
waffles.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.109
(siren wailing in distance)

39:06.111 --> 39:08.378
I don't--you know what?
I don't think that I should.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.779
Okay. What's going--

39:09.781 --> 39:12.015
This is not an "I don't feel
like waffles" look. This is--

39:12.017 --> 39:13.750
Joel... (sighs)

39:13.752 --> 39:15.785
I've had so much fun
with you.

39:15.787 --> 39:20.924
And you are--I mean, you are
an unbelievable guy.

39:20.926 --> 39:23.827
And I mean, you're--you're
amazing with ryan, and--

39:23.829 --> 39:25.462
But what?

39:25.464 --> 39:26.863
(stammers)

39:26.865 --> 39:28.898
I just--I guess I've been
waiting for, you know,

39:28.900 --> 39:30.800
Something to shift,
you know?

39:30.802 --> 39:34.971
For... (sighs) for you
to look at me different.

39:34.973 --> 39:39.142
And--and today, I realized
why that can't happen.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.677
Why?

39:40.679 --> 39:44.414
Because it's...
It's how you look at trebek.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.749
Alex and I have
a lot of history.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.384
And it doesn't--
it doesn't matter

39:47.386 --> 39:51.421
How much I like you, joel.
I just--I don't... (sighs)

39:51.423 --> 39:54.758
I don't think
that I'm up for that.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.892
I'm sorry.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.700
(whispers) bye.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.503
(the neighbourhood's
"sweater weather" playing)

40:06.505 --> 40:08.571
â™ª whoa

40:08.573 --> 40:10.840
â™ª whoa, oh

40:10.842 --> 40:12.876
â™ª whoa

40:14.011 --> 40:16.146
â™ª whoa

40:16.148 --> 40:18.815
â™ª whoa, oh

40:18.817 --> 40:22.018
â™ª whoa

40:22.020 --> 40:23.686
â™ª whoa

40:23.688 --> 40:27.657
â™ª whoa, oh

40:27.659 --> 40:31.694
â™ª 'cause it's too cold

40:31.696 --> 40:37.767
â™ª both your hands
in the holes of my sweater â™ª

40:37.769 --> 40:39.469
â™ª and it's too cold

40:39.471 --> 40:41.871
â™ª it's too cold

40:41.873 --> 40:44.707
â™ª the holes of my sweater

40:44.709 --> 40:46.709
Hi. My name is luke,

40:46.711 --> 40:50.046
And I am an alcoholic.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.815
(audience) hi, luke.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.650
Thank you.
That felt kind of nice.

40:53.652 --> 40:58.588
Um, I've been clean
for almost three months now.

40:58.590 --> 41:02.625
Today is the day
I air it all out. My story.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.960
(lowered voice)
what are you doing here?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.495
So here that goes.

41:05.497 --> 41:06.930
When I was 12,

41:06.932 --> 41:08.898
Just starting to understand
what it meant to be a man,

41:08.900 --> 41:10.900
My pop died.

41:10.902 --> 41:13.536
And my mother,
god bless her soul,

41:13.538 --> 41:15.638
She went off the rails.
She's a drunk...

41:15.640 --> 41:17.507
Like her son.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.775
Then I became a medic,

41:18.777 --> 41:20.577
And things really
got interesting.

41:20.579 --> 41:25.248
I took an... Ambulance
for a joyride...

41:25.250 --> 41:27.884
Across the border.

41:27.886 --> 41:31.020
And I hit bottom
a few months ago.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.056
My sister--she was there.

41:33.058 --> 41:36.259
She was there
to pick me up, you know?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.862
Like always.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.129
She dragged me,
kicking and screaming,

41:40.131 --> 41:42.665
To treatment
with you lovely people.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.636
She's it. She's, uh...

41:46.638 --> 41:48.171
She's the reason I'm here.

41:48.173 --> 41:51.207
She's the only reason.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.611
(indistinct conversations)

41:59.683 --> 42:01.651
Thank you.

42:04.788 --> 42:06.122
I am so proud of him.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.891
Yeah.

42:07.893 --> 42:08.758
Thank you.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.693
Yeah, well, uh--ooh.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.629
I would sort of
reserve your gratitude.

42:12.631 --> 42:14.531
It's, um, it's worse
than hospital coffee.

42:14.533 --> 42:15.532
Good stuff.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.267
See?

42:17.269 --> 42:18.768
So where's charlie?

42:18.770 --> 42:21.971
I don't know. He said he was
gonna be here, but...

42:21.973 --> 42:24.607
Well, that was
uncomfortable, wasn't it?

42:24.609 --> 42:25.875
You were great.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.844
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.212
What are you doing here?
Did you hear that?

42:29.214 --> 42:30.713
I did hear that, man.
Oh, man.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.115
You were stellar.

42:32.117 --> 42:33.783
You're being sweet.
You're being sweet.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.885
Well, I don't know.
I think we should celebrate.

42:35.887 --> 42:40.757
Let's go somewhere
with decent coffee, and...

42:40.759 --> 42:41.991
I want waffles.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.161
I like waffles.
Waffles?

42:45.163 --> 42:47.597
I could eat.
Okay.

42:47.599 --> 42:48.765
Where's charlie?
I don't know.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.767
Stuck in traffic, ya think?

42:50.769 --> 42:57.740
