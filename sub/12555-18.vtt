09:10.341 --> 09:12.503
VVE COULD ASK THE MINISTRY
OF VVAR IN LONDON.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.011
THERE MIGHT BE RECORDS
ON THIS DECKER.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.423

10:29.754 --> 10:31.085
NOT QUITE AS BAD
AS ALL THAT.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.789
I'M BEING KEPT HERE,
AM I NOT?

10:33.883 --> 10:35.715
I'M ONLY FOLLOWING
ORDERS, DECKER.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.509
WHAT EARTHLY GOOD
IS IT GOING TO DO

10:37.595 --> 10:39.131
FOR ME TO

10:39.222 --> 10:40.633
WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF SEEING MACKAYE?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.680
I'M NOT AFRAID.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.802

ABOUT THAT WHITE
CLOUD YOU SPOKE OF.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.690
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.532
NOW, LOOK HERE, DECKER.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.325
DO YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
ASKING US TO BELIEVE

11:02.412 --> 11:03.994
SOMETHING RATHER INCREDIBLE?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.662
A CLOUD OF SILENCE?

11:05.748 --> 11:07.409
A WORLD WAR I PILOT

11:07.500 --> 11:09.161
LANDING AT AN AMERICAN
BASE IN FRANCE IN 1959?

11:09.252 --> 11:11.334
SUCH A THING JUST DOESN'T
HAPPEN EVERY DAY!

11:11.421 --> 11:14.038
WELL, IT HAPPENED TODAY!

11:14.132 --> 11:16.499
NOW, LOOK HERE, I'VE TOLD
YOU I'LL SEE MACKAYE.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.379
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.683
YOU REALLY FEEL YOU
KNOW HIM, DON'T YOU?

11:30.773 --> 11:31.808
KNOW HIM?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.687
"OLD LEADBOTTOM?"

11:35.778 --> 11:39.567
LEADBOTTOM?

11:39.657 --> 11:43.571
YEAH, WELL,
WHENEVER WE FLY--

11:43.661 --> 11:46.403
WHENEVER WE <i>FLEW</i>
OVER THE GERMAN LINES

11:46.497 --> 11:49.364
THE SOLDIERS FIRED AT US.

11:49.459 --> 11:54.920
WELL, ONE DAY MACK GOT HIT
IN A MOST EMBARRASSING SPOT.

11:55.006 --> 11:59.876
I ALWAYS CALLED HIM
OLD LEADBOTTOM AFTER THAT.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.087
IT'S A PRIVATE JOKE,
OF COURSE.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.763
MACK'S A PROUD FELLOW,
YOU KNOW.

12:04.849 --> 12:08.262
HE WOULDN'T LIKE IT
IF I BRUITED IT ABOUT.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.017
BUT VVHY DO YOU KEEP
INSISTING THAT HE'S DEAD?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.847
BECAUSE THE LAST
I SAW OF HIM

12:13.900 --> 12:16.858
HE WAS CAUGHT IN A CIRCLE
OF SEVEN GERMAN PLANES.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.357
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD
DO ABOUT IT, OF COURSE.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.358
I WAS INVOLVED
WITH THREE OTHERS.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.191
OBVIOUSLY, HE
GOT AWAY.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.367
I DON'T SEE
HOW HE COULD HAVE.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.278
NOT ONLY COULD
HAVE, HE DID.

12:28.373 --> 12:32.662
HE VVAS ONE OF BRITAIN'S GREAT
HEROES DURING THE BLITZ.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.870
THAT VVAS THE SECOND
VVAR VVE TOLD YOU ABOUT.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.255
<i>WON THE D.F.C. FOR KNOCKING
DOWN THREE GERMAN BOMBERS</i>

12:46.349 --> 12:48.761
<i>ONE NIGHT OVER LONDON.</i>

12:48.851 --> 12:51.138
<i>HE UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED

13:04.575 --> 13:05.986
YES, YOU CAN
WAIT OUTSIDE.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.334
WHAT'S WRONG, DECKER?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.456
I'VE GOT TO LEAVE!

13:17.547 --> 13:19.663
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.089
MACKAYE VVILL BE HERE IN A VVHILE.
VVE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.125
I CAN'T SEE HIM.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.550
WHY NOT?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.593
HE'LL KNOVV ME FOR VVHAT I AM.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.636
WHAT ARE YOU?

13:26.723 --> 13:27.713
I'M A COWARD!

13:27.807 --> 13:28.512
I'M A COWARD.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.429
I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A COWARD.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.849
ALL MY LIFE I'VE
BEEN RUNNING AWAY

13:38.943 --> 13:42.106
PRETENDING TO BE SOMETHING
I NEVER WAS, NEVER COULD BE.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.566
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE--

13:43.656 --> 13:45.772
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING
TO RUN AWAY.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.032
BECAUSE I WANTED
SO DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE

13:48.119 --> 13:49.200
THAT I DID ESCAPE.

13:51.122 --> 13:55.457
<i>OH, I GOT BY WITH MY
PRETENDING WELL ENOUGH.</i>

13:55.543 --> 13:59.377
MY KIND OF
STRAINED IDIOCY

13:59.464 --> 14:03.298
IS EXACTLY THE BRAND
VVE ALL PUT ON.

14:03.343 --> 14:07.007
WE'RE PLAYING A PART,
YOU KNOW?

14:07.096 --> 14:11.556
BOYS ON A LARK-LAUGHING,
JOKING, DRINKING-

14:11.642 --> 14:14.885
OH, IT'S TOO MUCH,
ALL OF IT.

14:14.979 --> 14:19.644
AND TURNING INTO DEADLY,
ICE-COLD KILLERS IN THE SKY

14:19.734 --> 14:23.227
ALTHOUGH NOT ME,
OF COURSE.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.733
NO, NOT ME.

14:25.823 --> 14:32.490
UP THERE, I'M JUST AS AFRAID
AS I AM ON THE GROUND.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.073
AND MACK AND I ARE SUPPOSED
TO GO ON PATROLS TOGETHER

14:36.167 --> 14:39.751
BUT, UH... I CAN USUALLY
MANAGE TO PERSUADE HIM

14:39.837 --> 14:41.748
INTO SPLITTING UP.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.580
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HE ACTUALLY HOPES

14:43.674 --> 14:46.507
HE'LL RUN
INTO SOME TROUBLE.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.546
ME, WELL, I JUST...
LINGER IN THE CLOUDS

14:50.640 --> 14:54.929
FLYING BACK AND FORTH,
DREADING THE POSSIBILITY

14:55.019 --> 14:58.011
THAT I MIGHT SEE
AN ENEMY PLANE, AND...

14:58.064 --> 14:59.930
JUST HOPING
FOR ENOUGH TIME TO PASS

15:00.024 --> 15:03.767
SO THAT I CAN GO BACK.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.353
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK...

15:06.406 --> 15:09.694
I'LL LAND BEHIND
THE GERMAN LINES

15:09.742 --> 15:11.608
AND I'LL LET
MYSELF BE CAPTURED.

15:11.702 --> 15:16.071
THE PILOTS ALVVAYS GET THE
BEST OF TREATMENT, YOU KNOVV.

15:16.165 --> 15:20.454
BUT I'M AFRAID
OF DOING THAT EVEN.

15:20.545 --> 15:24.288
I'M AFRAID THAT I'D
BE DISCOVERED, AND--

15:24.382 --> 15:26.123
DISCREDITED.

15:26.217 --> 15:29.551
I COULDN'T BEAR THAT.

15:29.637 --> 15:35.303
I HAVE TO CARRY ON THE
SELF-DELUSION, YOU KNOVV.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.555
YOU KNOW--

15:37.603 --> 15:39.719
I'VE ACTUALLY
FIRED BULLETS

15:39.772 --> 15:41.228
THROUGH THE
COCKPIT WALLS

15:41.274 --> 15:42.764
SO THAT THE CHAPS
WILL SEE THEM

15:42.859 --> 15:46.318
AND BE IMPRESSED.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.860
GOD HELP ME.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.325
[Sigh]

16:06.799 --> 16:12.090
IT ISN'T A CRIME
TO BE AFRAID, DECKER.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.923
EVERYBODY'S AFRAID
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.091
I'M SURE MACKAYE
WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.097
NO.

16:20.146 --> 16:24.105
WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK HE KNOWS ANYWAY?

16:24.150 --> 16:28.144
BECAUSE IT VVAS ME THAT
LET THE GERMANS TRAP HIM.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.944
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID

16:29.989 --> 16:31.195
YOU WERE FIGHTING THREE
GERMAN PLANES YOURSELF.

16:31.282 --> 16:32.647
I WASN'T FIGHTING ANYONE!

16:32.742 --> 16:35.154
IWAS RUNNING!
IWAS RUNNING!

16:35.244 --> 16:38.032
WHEN THE GERMANS CAME AT US,
I LEFT HIM UP THERE TO DIE.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.453
BUT HE DIDN'T DIE!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.122
WELL, I CAN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT!

16:47.131 --> 16:49.793
WELL, MAYBE HE
GOT HELPED SOMEHOW.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.474
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:03.356 --> 17:05.848
WHAT YOU SAID.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.648
<i>WHA T?</i>

17:07.734 --> 17:09.351
THAT HE GOT HELP.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.732
IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE
REALM OF POSSIBILITIES.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.733
DON'T YOU SEE?

17:13.824 --> 17:16.906
MAYBE IT WAS ME
THAT HELPED HIM.

17:16.993 --> 17:18.280
I SAID WHEN
HE GOT HELP

17:18.371 --> 17:19.827
I MEANT THAT
SOMEBODY ELSE--

17:19.914 --> 17:21.905
THERE WASN'T ANYONE
WITHIN 5O MILES

17:21.999 --> 17:24.080
WHO COULD
HAVE HELPED HIM.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.829
MAYBE IT VVASN'T AN ACCIDENT
THAT I LANDED HERE.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.916
MAYBE I WAS BROUGHT HERE
FOR A PURPOSE--

17:29.006 --> 17:31.668
TO FIND OUT THAT
MACK HAD SURVIVED.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.835
TO FIND OUT THAT TIME VVAS
GIVING ME A SECOND CHANCE.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.511
YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME GO.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.928
BUT I CAN'T.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.301
YOU'VE GOT TO,
DON'T YOU SEE?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.678
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
I HAVE.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.304
IT'S THE ONLY CHANCE
HE HAS.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.931
BUT HE'S ALIVE. HE'S
COMING HERE TODAY.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.728
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT IF I DON'T GET BACK

17:45.815 --> 17:47.522
HE WON'T BE HERE?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.474
HOVV DO YOU KNOVV THAT HE
VVON'T HAVE BEEN KILLED

17:49.569 --> 17:52.106
42 YEARS AGO
UNLESS I HELP HIM NOW?

17:52.196 --> 17:54.062
THAT'S INSANITY, DECKER.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.281
(technician) HEY, WHERE DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

19:42.932 --> 19:44.138

TURN IT OFF!</i>

19:44.183 --> 19:45.469
NO.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.883

19:46.977 --> 19:48.479
IT'S NOT JUST HIM.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.814
IT'S ALL THOSE OTHER
LIVES HE SAVED.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.308
ARE THEY TO BE LOST AS WELL?

19:51.399 --> 19:53.515
TURN IT OFF, DECKER,
OR I'LL FIRE.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.725
WELL, FIRE.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.151
I'D RATHER DIE.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.525
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, MAJOR.
