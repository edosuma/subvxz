WEBVTT

00:03.911 --> 00:07.711
I don't belong to a health club. I have a
limit on naked men I see in one day.

00:07.881 --> 00:09.508
Zero.

00:09.683 --> 00:11.446
That's it.

00:11.618 --> 00:14.644
What is with the high level of security
at health clubs, you know?

00:14.821 --> 00:17.153
The picture IDs. Security guards.
Signing in and out.

00:17.324 --> 00:18.985
What is this, the Kremlin?

00:19.159 --> 00:23.653
I mean, the people with a membership
go twice a year. Who's breaking in?

00:24.464 --> 00:28.491
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?

00:28.669 --> 00:31.763
And what if they catch the person?
What then? They run. It's aerobic.

00:31.939 --> 00:33.907
Makes it even worse.

00:40.881 --> 00:43.213
- Hi, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.

00:43.383 --> 00:45.476
I last about 10 minutes
on the StairMaster.

00:45.652 --> 00:49.520
Unless someone's stretching in front of
me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

00:50.057 --> 00:52.321
- Really?
- That's why it's called the StairMaster.

00:52.492 --> 00:54.483
You get up there and you stare.

00:54.861 --> 00:58.490
Well, I'm done.
I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.

00:58.665 --> 01:00.098
I'll see you Thursday night?

01:00.267 --> 01:01.666
- Thursday night.
- Okay.

01:03.837 --> 01:05.394
Good workout?

01:05.572 --> 01:07.767
Tremendous workout.

01:08.642 --> 01:11.668
- It's a pretty girl.
- Tremendous girl.

01:11.845 --> 01:14.939
- She the one you went out with?
- Yeah. I really like her.

01:15.115 --> 01:18.516
You know, they're fake.

01:20.687 --> 01:23.349
- What? Don't say that.
- No. They're fake.

01:23.523 --> 01:25.514
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

01:25.692 --> 01:28.388
You know how you always brag
how you can spot a lesbian?

01:29.262 --> 01:32.197
I'm not bragging. I happen to
have a very keen lesbian eye.

01:32.366 --> 01:34.732
Hi, how you doing?

01:34.901 --> 01:37.369
Oh, right.

01:37.537 --> 01:41.303
Come on. Don't you think
they seem just a bit too perfect?

01:41.475 --> 01:43.466
Yes, they do.

01:45.045 --> 01:47.878
I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.

01:48.048 --> 01:52.815
Leg man? Why would I be a leg man?
I don't need legs. I have legs.

01:54.621 --> 01:56.521
Have you seen her naked
in the locker room?

01:56.690 --> 01:58.521
- No.
- Then I can't accept your testimony.

01:58.692 --> 02:00.023
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.

02:00.193 --> 02:02.423
- I don't wanna see her naked.
- Well, I do.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.530
Well, that's your problem.

02:04.698 --> 02:07.667
Look, you made the allegation.
The least you could do is follow up.

02:08.235 --> 02:11.898
Jerry, what am I gonna do? Go in
there and spy on her in the sauna?

02:12.072 --> 02:15.872
Yes. Go in there. Do a little
investigative journalism.

02:16.043 --> 02:17.271
I need to know.

02:17.444 --> 02:20.504
But a few more dates,
you can find out for yourself.

02:20.681 --> 02:22.410
Don't be so sure. Look at George.

02:22.582 --> 02:25.278
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.

02:25.452 --> 02:26.680
What's his problem?

02:26.853 --> 02:29.014
Every time he makes a move
something screws up.

02:29.189 --> 02:30.986
Their last date
they were on the couch...

02:31.158 --> 02:33.456
...but she was on his wrong side.
- Wrong side?

02:33.627 --> 02:37.085
Yeah, she was on his right side. He
can't make a move with his left hand.

02:37.264 --> 02:38.561
Can't go left.

02:39.599 --> 02:40.930
- He can't go left?
- No.

02:41.101 --> 02:43.763
I'm lefty. Can't go right.

02:44.304 --> 02:46.067
What about women?
They go left or right?

02:46.239 --> 02:48.537
No, we just play defense.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074

03:11.164 --> 03:12.825
Could I ask you a question?

03:14.034 --> 03:16.127
Would you mind switching seats?

03:18.071 --> 03:24.567
Actually, I'd really prefer to sit here.
I don't hear very well out of this ear.

03:25.712 --> 03:29.307
I always try to sit
to the right of people.

03:30.283 --> 03:32.183
I'll shout.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.988
Well, I really think
I feel more comfortable here.

03:36.156 --> 03:37.919
Come on, come on.

03:38.091 --> 03:39.786
- Come on, really. Come on.
- George, l...

03:39.960 --> 03:42.224
- Now, come on.
- No, I really...

03:48.802 --> 03:51.498
See, now is that so bad?

03:51.671 --> 03:53.161
What?

03:54.941 --> 03:56.499
- Oh, l...
- The machine will get it.

03:56.676 --> 03:57.904
No, it's not on.

03:58.078 --> 04:00.842
- They'll call back.
- George, what if it's an emergency?

04:01.014 --> 04:03.710
In the whole world right now
there's maybe three emergencies.

04:03.884 --> 04:06.819
Why would you think on this
planet that you're one of those three?

04:06.987 --> 04:09.683
George, please.

04:12.125 --> 04:13.922
Hello.

04:14.261 --> 04:15.489
What?

04:15.662 --> 04:17.994
Oh, my God.

04:18.665 --> 04:21.634
All right, maybe four.

04:24.204 --> 04:26.468
Boy, I'm really sweating.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.201
Good sweat. Beads of sweat.
Sweating bullets.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.200
Look at her.

04:32.379 --> 04:35.212
I don't need to see her naked
to know those aren't real.

04:35.382 --> 04:37.714
I mean, why'd she even
tie the towel around her?

04:37.884 --> 04:40.478
She's got a rack on her chest.

04:42.889 --> 04:46.222
Oh, God.
Sidra's taking the towel off.

04:48.895 --> 04:50.590
Doctor.

04:50.764 --> 04:51.992
That's it.

04:52.165 --> 04:54.759
I knew it. I knew it.
They're definitely fake.

04:54.935 --> 04:57.199
So when's the funeral?

04:58.538 --> 04:59.869
Oh, well.

05:00.040 --> 05:05.342
Aunt Clarice was so ill
I guess it was really a blessing.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.889
Yeah, I'll fly home
as soon as I can.

05:22.863 --> 05:27.163
Okay. You too. Get some sleep.

05:34.541 --> 05:36.031
- You're sure?
- Positive.

05:36.209 --> 05:39.007
This chick's playing
with Confederate money.

05:39.179 --> 05:40.942
Then that's it.
That's the end of that.

05:41.114 --> 05:43.309
- What? Just because that?
- Just because of that?

05:43.483 --> 05:46.680
It's like finding out
Mickey Mantle corked his bat.

05:48.221 --> 05:51.315
You've dated women with nose jobs.
What's the difference?

05:51.491 --> 05:56.428
You don't touch the nose.
You don't aspire to reach the nose.

05:56.596 --> 05:58.791
You don't unhook anything
to get to a nose...

05:58.965 --> 06:02.628
...and no man has ever tried to look
up a woman's nostrils.

06:05.805 --> 06:08.069
You've put a lot of thought into this,
haven't you?

06:08.241 --> 06:09.606
Well, I take it very seriously.

06:10.677 --> 06:15.080
Sometimes when I think you're
the shallowest man I've ever met...

06:15.248 --> 06:18.740
...you somehow manage
to drain a little more out of the pool.

06:20.253 --> 06:22.551
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:24.157 --> 06:25.454
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:25.625 --> 06:28.287
You know, I do kind of wonder
what fake breasts feel like.

06:28.461 --> 06:30.429
Well, I know what they feel like.

06:30.597 --> 06:31.825
You? How do you know?

06:31.998 --> 06:34.762
Well, I lived in Los Angeles
for three months.

06:34.935 --> 06:37.927
- I thought you hated Los Angeles.
- No, I do.

06:38.104 --> 06:40.664
Just miss
the warm weather, you know?

06:41.041 --> 06:43.066
Oh, man, I wish I could get away.

06:43.243 --> 06:45.677
Real busy now, down at the office?

06:45.979 --> 06:48.641
No. You know who I saw
at the health club?

06:48.815 --> 06:50.806
Salman Rushdie.

06:50.984 --> 06:53.680
- No.
- Yeah, right.

06:53.853 --> 06:55.184
Salman Rushdie.

06:55.355 --> 06:58.153
Well, I could see that. You got
five million Moslems after you.

06:58.325 --> 07:00.486
You wanna stay
in pretty good shape.

07:01.661 --> 07:02.889
I know what the problem is.

07:03.596 --> 07:06.156
I like her too much.
That's why I can't make a move.

07:06.333 --> 07:10.394
- You put her on a pedestal.
- I put them on a dental chair.

07:10.837 --> 07:13.169
He puts them on a dental chair.

07:13.373 --> 07:16.740
I'm not her boyfriend.
I wanna be her boyfriend.

07:18.611 --> 07:21.079
It's like a sauna in here.

07:26.186 --> 07:27.710
- That's funny.
- You're a funny guy.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.787
Never heard that before.

07:30.457 --> 07:32.118
So you going to the funeral?

07:32.292 --> 07:33.953
- You think I should?
- Are you kidding?

07:34.127 --> 07:36.527
It's a golden opportunity
to advance the relationship.

07:36.696 --> 07:39.256
She's crying. You put your arm
around her and console her.

07:39.432 --> 07:41.195
You're the consolation guy.

07:41.368 --> 07:45.828
- I'm the consolation guy.
- Consolation guy is big.

07:46.573 --> 07:48.564
Her aunt dying
is the best thing for you.

07:48.742 --> 07:51.336
It's like 10 dates in one shot.

07:52.045 --> 07:55.344
This confers upon you
instant boyfriend status.

07:55.515 --> 07:57.039
The family's there.

07:57.217 --> 08:01.210
You're taking care of things. You're
getting sandwiches. You're the rock.

08:01.388 --> 08:03.788
It's in Detroit, though.
It's an expensive flight.

08:03.957 --> 08:07.051
Why don't you get a
"death in the family" fare?

08:07.227 --> 08:08.785
What?

08:10.430 --> 08:13.456
Go to the airlines. Tell them
that you have a death in the family...

08:13.633 --> 08:15.999
...they give you
50 percent off the fare.

08:16.169 --> 08:17.431
- Really?
- In fact...

08:17.604 --> 08:20.903
...listen, I'll go with you. We'll tell them
there's a death in my family.

08:21.074 --> 08:23.201
You buy the ticket. I'll split it.

08:23.376 --> 08:27.608
Then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll
get to Detroit for a quarter of the price.

08:29.482 --> 08:34.078
Boy, I'm getting a good sweat here.
Great sweat. Good beads. Nice beads.

08:35.020 --> 08:40.323
Oh, look who's here.
Silicon Valley.

08:41.061 --> 08:45.293
Oh, so anyway. We go out on one date,
and he asks me out for a second...

08:45.465 --> 08:48.059
...and then out of nowhere he calls me,
cancels the date...

08:48.234 --> 08:50.725
...and says
he doesn't wanna see me again.

08:51.838 --> 08:54.466
Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.

08:54.641 --> 08:57.405
- Oh, that's okay.
- Did he give you a reason?

08:57.577 --> 09:00.512
Yeah. He's going back
to his old girlfriend.

09:01.114 --> 09:02.342
Really?

09:02.515 --> 09:04.449
Said she's mentally ill.

09:07.454 --> 09:10.890
He's one of those guys who is
obsessed with neatness and order.

09:11.057 --> 09:15.517
Everything has gotta be just so.
He would have made a great Nazi.

09:19.632 --> 09:21.600
Hey, does he ever
talk about Superman?

09:21.768 --> 09:26.102
- Yes. How did you know?
- I know the type.

09:26.272 --> 09:28.297
- Oh, so you can relate?
- Oh, yeah.

09:28.475 --> 09:32.309
You know, I've seen you around the
club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

09:32.479 --> 09:35.107
- Oh, hi. I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

09:41.688 --> 09:45.146
Anyway, I stood up to shake her hand
and suddenly I lost my balance...

09:45.325 --> 09:48.226
...and I fell right into her.
- You fell on her?

09:48.695 --> 09:50.219
I touched them.

09:52.031 --> 09:53.293
You what?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.163
I touched them.

09:57.337 --> 09:58.565
You touched them?

09:58.738 --> 10:01.605
I needed them to help me
break my fall.

10:01.875 --> 10:05.538
If it hadn't been for them,
I could have really injured myself.

10:08.481 --> 10:09.470
Anyway...

10:10.316 --> 10:11.544
...they're real.

10:13.486 --> 10:15.249
Excuse me.

10:16.189 --> 10:18.054
I think they might be real.

10:18.224 --> 10:21.421
Oh, what do you know? You have
no breast-touching experience.

10:21.594 --> 10:24.927
- I've touched mine.
- So have I.

10:25.798 --> 10:28.164
Oh, right, I forgot.

10:31.171 --> 10:34.265
Anyway, touching two breasts
doesn't make you an expert.

10:34.974 --> 10:41.277
All right. Anyway, I think they're real,
and if they are, they are spectacular.

10:43.049 --> 10:45.779
What are you doing to me?

10:49.522 --> 10:50.819
You see...

10:50.990 --> 10:53.959
...my friend here,
his aunt passed away last...

10:54.127 --> 10:55.685
Oh, I'm very sorry.

10:55.862 --> 11:01.266
I saw her last week. She looked
healthy and peaceful but she knew.

11:01.434 --> 11:03.561
You poor thing.

11:04.304 --> 11:07.762
You don't think you could buy
the ticket yourself? Oh, no, okay.

11:07.941 --> 11:11.934
- I couldn't...
- No, please. There, there. You sit.

11:12.111 --> 11:14.443
I'll purchase the ticket for you.

11:14.614 --> 11:15.979
You're a good friend.

11:16.583 --> 11:20.542
I understand you offer a
50-percent-off bereavement fare?

11:20.720 --> 11:25.487
Yes. You have to pay the full fare now
then return to one of our counters...

11:25.658 --> 11:29.856
...with a copy of the death certificate,
and we'll refund half your fare.

11:32.332 --> 11:34.300
The death certificate?

11:34.467 --> 11:38.665
Yes, we do need documentation
or people could take advantage.

11:38.838 --> 11:43.002
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

11:43.176 --> 11:44.905
I know but it happens.

11:45.078 --> 11:50.482
You want my friend to ask his uncle,
a man who lost his wife of 44 years...

11:50.650 --> 11:53.517
...for a death certificate to
save a few bucks on a flight?

11:53.686 --> 11:56.814
That would be $387 round trip.

11:56.990 --> 12:00.391
- You'll need my frequent flyer number.
- Yes.

12:03.596 --> 12:05.325
I don't know.
One minute they're fake...

12:05.498 --> 12:07.932
...the next they're real.
I don't know what to believe.

12:08.101 --> 12:11.935
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only
one who's touched them.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.338
Well, you were grabbing
onto them to save your life.

12:16.509 --> 12:18.500
If you were drowning and
I threw you a life preserver...

12:18.678 --> 12:21.112
...you think you could tell
me if it was an inflatable?

12:21.281 --> 12:23.772
I wouldn't have said anything if
I'd known you'd stop seeing her.

12:23.950 --> 12:28.011
I don't mind a phony personality
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

12:29.088 --> 12:31.181
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:31.357 --> 12:33.882
- George off to Detroit?
- Yep. And in two days...

12:34.060 --> 12:36.187
...l'm off to Puerto Rico.

12:36.863 --> 12:38.524
Hey, Kramer, by the way...

12:38.698 --> 12:42.361
...I saw that guy at the health club.
That is not Salman Rushdie.

12:42.969 --> 12:44.368
Wrong.

12:47.307 --> 12:48.672
- There's Sidra.
- There's Salman.

12:48.841 --> 12:50.433
- Where?
- Talking to that woman.

12:50.610 --> 12:52.976
- To Sidra?
- lf that's Sidra, she's talking to Salman.

12:53.146 --> 12:55.512
- I don't think that's Salman.
- I don't think they're real.

12:55.682 --> 12:58.082
- lf that's Rushdie, they're real.
- lf they're real, that's Rushdie.

12:58.251 --> 13:00.685
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Sidra.
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Salman.

13:02.889 --> 13:05.722
Like a sauna in here, huh?

13:08.161 --> 13:11.494
Feel like I'm back at the desert.

13:14.867 --> 13:17.927
- You've lived in the desert?
- Oh, yeah. I've...

13:18.104 --> 13:21.039
I spent a little time
in the Mideast.

13:22.275 --> 13:24.300
You ever been to the Mideast?

13:24.477 --> 13:28.243
- Yes, I've been there.
- Look, my name's Kramer.

13:28.815 --> 13:30.043
- Sal Bass.
- Yeah.

13:30.216 --> 13:32.184
- Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
- Yeah.

13:32.785 --> 13:35.015
So...

13:35.855 --> 13:38.187
...what kind of work do you do?

13:38.825 --> 13:40.793
I'm a writer.

13:43.463 --> 13:47.297
- Have you met my boyfriend, George?
- No.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.436
George, this is Aunt May
and Father Jessup.

13:50.603 --> 13:52.628
Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.

13:52.805 --> 13:55.467
This is my boyfriend, George.

13:55.641 --> 13:58.303
Oh, George, how nice of you
to come all this way.

13:58.478 --> 14:03.643
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise,
what's the point of being the boyfriend.

14:03.816 --> 14:07.377
This is where you have to be
when you're the boyfriend.

14:07.987 --> 14:10.547
Betsy, dear,
have you had anything to eat?

14:10.723 --> 14:14.022
- I'm not very hungry.
- They have some very nice snacks.

14:14.193 --> 14:17.219
I'm about to get myself a snack.

14:17.397 --> 14:19.922
Oh, no. You sit right here.

14:20.099 --> 14:22.863
I will get you a nice snack.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.341
This is my...

14:29.542 --> 14:32.204
...third wake this month.

14:32.378 --> 14:34.005
Never gets any easier.

14:34.180 --> 14:37.513
Well, losing a loved one is...

14:37.683 --> 14:39.913
I mean, forget about it.

14:48.795 --> 14:50.456
You...

14:51.330 --> 14:54.265
You seem to be of great comfort
to Betsy. We're very appreciative.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.493
Comfort "schmomfort."

14:58.237 --> 15:02.606
Listen, Father,
can I ask you a question?

15:02.975 --> 15:05.603
In a terrible time like this...

15:05.778 --> 15:08.941
...who would I get the
death certificate from?

15:10.750 --> 15:13.685
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, how can you be so sure?

15:13.853 --> 15:18.984
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer.
He said his name was Sal Bass.

15:19.158 --> 15:20.455
Bass, Jerry.

15:20.626 --> 15:23.720
Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.

15:23.896 --> 15:26.990
He just substituted
one fish for another.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.797
Look, you idiot, first of all,
it's "Salman," not "salmon."

15:31.971 --> 15:34.701
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing
the big picture.

15:34.874 --> 15:37.342
All right. Maybe it is,
but listen, I gotta get ready...

15:37.510 --> 15:39.569
...Sidra's coming over
so if you don't mind...

15:39.745 --> 15:43.237
- What, did you ask her?
- I'm gonna find out tonight.

15:43.416 --> 15:45.316
Yes.

15:47.186 --> 15:49.586
Why do you need
a death certificate?

15:51.224 --> 15:53.715
Well, Dr. Allenwood...

15:54.160 --> 15:57.152
...I was hoping to compile an...

15:57.330 --> 16:02.700
...admittedly rudimentary
scrapbook of her life.

16:03.469 --> 16:06.768
Something that Betsy
could have and hold on to.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.567
Well, I suppose I could
make a copy of it.

16:09.742 --> 16:11.266
Oh, that would be wonderful.

16:11.878 --> 16:15.279
- Well, it's nice meeting you, George.
- Likewise.

16:30.329 --> 16:31.956
What are you doing?

16:33.065 --> 16:35.397
- What?
- Did...?

16:35.568 --> 16:37.627
Did you just double dip that chip?

16:38.704 --> 16:40.569
- Excuse me?
- You double dipped the chip.

16:40.740 --> 16:43.072
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

16:43.242 --> 16:46.575
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

16:46.746 --> 16:48.873
...and you dipped again.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.283
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth...

16:53.452 --> 16:55.477
...right in the dip.

16:56.756 --> 17:02.422
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

17:05.698 --> 17:08.929
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...

17:09.602 --> 17:11.126
...but I don't dip that way.

17:11.304 --> 17:13.101
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

17:13.271 --> 17:16.105
You dip the way you wanna dip...

17:16.275 --> 17:18.003
...l'll dip the way I wanna dip.

17:18.176 --> 17:19.734
- Give me the chip.
- Hey, hey, hey!

17:19.912 --> 17:21.140
Give me the chip.

17:22.348 --> 17:25.839
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I must be crazy.

17:38.531 --> 17:41.261
- Hey, you mind switching seats?
- Why?

17:41.434 --> 17:45.632
I don't know. I like sitting to the left of
people. Makes me feel like I'm driving.

17:46.572 --> 17:48.938
Okay.

17:55.848 --> 17:57.907
- How you doing?
- Good.

17:58.084 --> 17:59.984
- How you doing?
- Good.

18:00.152 --> 18:02.120
Feel good.

18:03.956 --> 18:06.481
You know that Jayne Mansfield
had some big breasts.

18:11.764 --> 18:12.992
Really big...

18:13.165 --> 18:16.328
Huge. Just coming out the top of
her dress. They were choking her.

18:17.703 --> 18:20.797
- I hear that's how she died.
- Yeah.

18:22.708 --> 18:24.642
Have you noticed
that women today are...?

18:24.810 --> 18:26.744
You know, they seem bigger.

18:27.279 --> 18:29.406
- A lot of women are having them done.
- Really?

18:29.582 --> 18:31.982
- Yeah.
- How do you like that?

18:32.151 --> 18:34.881
A lot of people ask me
if I've had mine done.

18:35.054 --> 18:37.454
You know people.

18:37.723 --> 18:40.055
Gets a little tiring.
It's none of their business.

18:40.226 --> 18:42.751
Oh, the nerve.

18:43.663 --> 18:46.928
You know some people have
asked me if you've done that.

18:47.533 --> 18:48.864
And what do you tell them?

18:49.602 --> 18:52.093
Whatever you want me
to tell them.

18:52.838 --> 18:56.103
Well, I think
you'll find out soon enough.

19:03.382 --> 19:05.247
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- No.

19:05.418 --> 19:08.251
- Well, what if it's an emergency?
- Oh, there's no emergency.

19:08.421 --> 19:11.754
Jerry. Come on.
It's an emergency.

19:13.726 --> 19:15.523
Excuse me.

19:16.662 --> 19:18.391
All right.

19:18.564 --> 19:20.191
What is it? You're interrupting.

19:20.366 --> 19:24.735
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.
I need to borrow your bathing suit.

19:25.237 --> 19:27.467
This is an emergency?
You need a bathing suit?

19:27.640 --> 19:28.902
Well, I like yours.

19:30.342 --> 19:34.108
I don't know, my bathing suit?
That's a little familiar.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.681
I don't want your boys down there.

19:43.255 --> 19:45.450
What's the matter with my boys?

19:45.624 --> 19:49.219
Your boys should stay
in their neighborhood.

19:50.763 --> 19:54.062
- All right, come on.
- All right. It's in the top drawer.

19:54.233 --> 19:56.463
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

19:56.769 --> 19:59.465
- Hi, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

19:59.638 --> 20:03.233
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
- Hi. Elaine?

20:07.113 --> 20:09.104
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Kramer.

20:09.715 --> 20:10.943
- What's going on?
- She was just...

20:11.117 --> 20:13.483
...showing me pictures
of places in Puerto Rico.

20:13.652 --> 20:16.143
- When you two went down there.
- Oh, yeah. All right.

20:16.322 --> 20:18.517
- Well, just...
- You know, these...

20:18.691 --> 20:20.090
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

20:25.064 --> 20:26.395
So where were we?

20:26.565 --> 20:29.796
- I was just leaving.
- Right. You were leaving.

20:29.969 --> 20:32.802
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

20:32.972 --> 20:34.769
That was an accident.

20:34.940 --> 20:37.932
I think you're both mentally ill.

20:45.217 --> 20:50.484
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

20:51.290 --> 20:55.249
Stop it, George. Get out. Get out!
I never wanna see you again.

20:55.427 --> 20:58.396
- Go back to New York.
- Get out.

21:00.866 --> 21:05.394
All right, sir. Now all I need is a death
certificate and you'll be on your way.

21:06.071 --> 21:09.199
Well, you see
what happened was...

21:09.942 --> 21:15.938
...the doctor, the very same doctor that
was attending my late aunt suffered...

21:16.115 --> 21:18.345
...an untimely stroke...

21:18.517 --> 21:22.180
...and lost the use
of his right hand so...

21:22.354 --> 21:26.051
...obviously I was unable to get
the death certificate.

21:26.225 --> 21:29.217
However, I do have this.

21:30.396 --> 21:33.263
What's this?
- A picture of me next to the coffin.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.596
- Nice try.
- Not even close, huh?

21:36.769 --> 21:38.236
No.

21:42.575 --> 21:45.772
The cosmetic surgery procedures
that are available to people today...

21:45.945 --> 21:47.776
Liposuction.
Are you familiar with this?

21:47.947 --> 21:50.040
This is a fat-sucking machine.

21:50.216 --> 21:52.946
Now, you know, somewhere,
somebody is working on a way...

21:53.118 --> 21:55.484
...that this thing could go
into a restaurant.

21:55.654 --> 21:57.884
And you could just
order it off the menu.

21:58.057 --> 22:00.116
Give me the cheesecake,
crank me up to nine...

22:00.292 --> 22:02.556
...and put a scoop of ice cream
on the side.
