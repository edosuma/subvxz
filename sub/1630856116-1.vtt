08:46.743 --> 08:49.703
Have you heard
the hamster song?

08:49.790 --> 08:51.531
<i>♪ You can get with this,
or you can get with that ♪</i>

08:51.618 --> 08:53.358
<i>I remember being
on the radio</i>

08:53.445 --> 08:55.491
<i>and being like,
fuck that, no.</i>

08:55.578 --> 08:57.493
You will not refer to
"The Choice Is Yours"

08:57.580 --> 08:59.321
as the goddamn hamster song.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.062
<i>But it was a thing.</i>

09:01.149 --> 09:04.761
What the hell is that?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.024
And then that song getting
placed in the Spidey-Verse.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.029
Got a seven-year-old
who know that record.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.988
You know what I'm saying?

09:14.075 --> 09:16.120
<i>Like, that song is like the
gift that keeps on giving.</i>

09:16.207 --> 09:18.906
Also have the youth,
the drill artists,

09:18.993 --> 09:20.429
<i>Lola Brooke sampling
"The Choice is Yours."</i>

09:20.516 --> 09:22.039
- ♪ Because you ain't getting ♪
- ♪ This or that ♪

09:23.214 --> 09:24.868
♪ Man, sis, just relax ♪

09:24.955 --> 09:26.435
Incredible track.

09:26.522 --> 09:30.178
You know, what would
hip-hop be without it?

09:30.265 --> 09:34.138
♪ The more things change,
the more they stay the same ♪

09:34.225 --> 09:37.054
All right, I'm going to
keep that one and double it.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.926
<i>There's a lot of cats
that got a lot</i>

09:39.013 --> 09:41.276
<i>of things going on
in their career</i>

09:41.363 --> 09:44.061
<i>and legacy and whatnot.</i>

09:44.148 --> 09:47.978
<i>But not a lot of people
have a "Choice Is Yours."</i>

09:48.065 --> 09:50.590
<i>And, you know,
like, I don't really</i>

09:50.677 --> 09:54.115
<i>harp on
what me and Lawnge did...</i>

09:54.202 --> 09:56.160
Okay, okay.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.380
<i>As much as I harp
on what I still have to do.</i>

09:58.467 --> 10:01.731
<i>And that's why this Dilla
project is so important.</i>

10:01.818 --> 10:03.820
<i>So, for me, in my career,</i>

10:03.907 --> 10:06.083
<i>it's just been
about staying prepared.</i>

10:06.170 --> 10:09.086
<i>It's about doing the work.
It's about spreading love.</i>

10:09.173 --> 10:12.307
<i>It's about, you know, not
hoarding because we do shit</i>

10:12.394 --> 10:14.483
<i>despite what's against us.</i>

10:14.570 --> 10:17.007
<i>You know, like,
hip-hop exists despite.</i>

10:17.094 --> 10:19.009
It's almost like you
were sliding through it.

10:19.096 --> 10:21.098
You know what I'm saying?
All right.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.406
<i>It definitely
wasn't in the plans.</i>

10:26.887 --> 10:29.193
<i>Would you call your
music hard-core rap?</i>

10:29.280 --> 10:30.412
I wouldn't call it hard-core.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.805
We painted a lot
of pictures.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.197
We didn't draw the
pictures ourselves.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.590
We just colored it in.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.026
Curse--
a lot of words

10:36.113 --> 10:37.637
that I don't think you're
going to ever get played

10:37.724 --> 10:39.377
on television or the radio.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.168
We don't really try to put it
all into distinct categories.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.649
It's all music, and what
you do with it is personal,

10:49.736 --> 10:51.259
and it's something that
you share with people.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.000
You know, people have told me,
I'm not really into rap,

10:53.087 --> 10:54.436
but your group is
all right with me.

10:54.523 --> 10:57.700
And that's cool, you know,
because that's broadening us.

10:57.787 --> 11:01.138
That's broadening them,
and that's helping rap.

11:01.225 --> 11:04.838
<i>Beyond a beat,
a rhyme, a dance,</i>

11:04.925 --> 11:07.623
<i>hip-hop music has become
this life-altering,</i>

11:07.710 --> 11:10.147
<i>positive difference maker.</i>

11:10.234 --> 11:13.411
<i>Like, there's so many
different working pieces now,</i>

11:13.498 --> 11:16.893
<i>that a livelihood can
be found all around it.</i>

11:16.980 --> 11:19.983
<i>It's the result
of imagination,</i>

11:20.070 --> 11:22.769
<i>and so much rests</i>

11:22.856 --> 11:25.946
<i>on the shoulders
of our elders.</i>

11:26.033 --> 11:28.252
<i>WIHD, Washington.</i>

11:28.339 --> 11:29.950
<i>In Washington.</i>

11:30.037 --> 11:31.995
<i>I want to say sunny, but
you can see, there's--</i>

11:32.082 --> 11:35.912
<i>I'm here for this induction
into The Hip-Hop Museum.</i>

11:38.219 --> 11:40.525
<i>You know, like, this is not
a me and Mista Lawnge thing.</i>

11:40.612 --> 11:42.832
<i>This is--</i>

11:42.919 --> 11:44.225
<i>I didn't hit
him up or anything.</i>

11:44.312 --> 11:45.748
<i>I didn't--</i>

11:45.835 --> 11:49.317
Yeah, like, I'm very
grateful to Lawnge.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.101
You know what I'm saying?

11:51.188 --> 11:53.669
Like, you know, without
Lawnge, we're not sitting here.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.236
I'm not sitting
here without Lawnge.

11:55.323 --> 11:58.152
You know what I'm saying?
So I'm always--

11:58.239 --> 11:59.631
I always keep that
in perspective.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.329
You know what I'm saying?

12:01.416 --> 12:03.679
And I think it took me
a while to get to the place

12:03.766 --> 12:07.552
where I felt like
I didn't owe that situation

12:07.639 --> 12:09.990
my loyalty anymore.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.208
We're going to
go walk around,

12:11.295 --> 12:13.167
check it out, take a
look around the curtain

12:13.254 --> 12:14.516
and see what it looked
like in there real quick.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.126
Come on, before
we go get a drink.

12:16.213 --> 12:19.521
Black Sheep.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.870
Word up.
Service is in the house.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.698
Word up.
Service in the house.

12:25.353 --> 12:28.835
<i>Making hit records
can definitely be</i>

12:28.922 --> 12:31.272
<i>a burden on that bad side of,</i>

12:31.359 --> 12:33.230
<i>yeah, this is what
you're known for.</i>

12:33.317 --> 12:34.797
When people come up to
me, and they do the--

12:34.884 --> 12:36.756
"It's just me, myself, and I."

12:36.843 --> 12:38.192
♪ It's just me, myself, and I ♪

12:38.279 --> 12:40.281
And I just want to
smack them in the face.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.415
<i>I mean, yeah, you
have to keep playing</i>

12:44.502 --> 12:46.287
<i>that song no matter what.</i>

12:46.374 --> 12:47.897
<i>I have a saying--</i>

12:47.984 --> 12:49.725
You got to dance with
the ho that you brought.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.336
This is what got
you to the party.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.861
So when you're in the party
now, you're in a party now.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.123
You got to dance with her now.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.081
She brought you,
you have to dance with her.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.175
<i>I don't think you're rubbing
someone the wrong way when you</i>

13:05.262 --> 13:07.134
<i>say that Black Sheep
was never able to get</i>

13:07.221 --> 13:09.136
<i>back to the heights of
"The Choice Is Yours."</i>

13:09.223 --> 13:13.053
<i>I mean, that was basically
an impossible task.</i>

13:13.140 --> 13:16.360
<i>When you are associated
with something</i>

13:16.447 --> 13:19.711
that is so legendary

13:19.799 --> 13:21.801
and then you come out of that,

13:21.888 --> 13:26.066
you're like,
what am I supposed to do now?

13:26.153 --> 13:28.938
We're getting up pretty far
on the pop charts, you know,

13:29.025 --> 13:30.113
with that single.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.941
Now that we found
something that's

13:32.028 --> 13:33.464
working for us, like
"The Choice Is Yours,"

13:33.551 --> 13:36.511
it will be easy to say, damn,
let's go, you know, make

13:36.598 --> 13:38.730
"A Choice Is Ours,"
now or whatever, you know,

13:38.818 --> 13:40.863
and follow it up like
everybody else would do.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.778
But I think we'd rather
reach somewhere else.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.911
And even if, you know, we fall
flat on our face,

13:44.998 --> 13:47.522
at least we was trying
to be ourselves.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.222
<i>They really had, like,
a four-single run</i>

13:52.309 --> 13:55.965
<i>off their first album,
which is great,</i>

13:56.052 --> 14:00.840
<i>and then took a few years off.</i>

14:00.927 --> 14:02.363
I don't know how
many people you're

14:02.450 --> 14:04.495
going to find besides
me that will be

14:04.582 --> 14:06.497
able to tell you the name
of their first single

14:06.584 --> 14:08.673
off the next album.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.546
<i>You would think that an artist</i>

14:11.633 --> 14:14.070
<i>who had a song that big--</i>

14:14.157 --> 14:16.246
<i>people would at
least remember what</i>

14:16.333 --> 14:18.466
they came with after that.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.948
I don't think anyone does.

14:22.035 --> 14:24.602
<i>The next song--
it was "Without A Doubt."</i>

14:24.689 --> 14:26.213
all:
♪ Yeah, without a doubt ♪

14:26.300 --> 14:29.956
<i>It was a cool
song, but it just--</i>

14:30.043 --> 14:32.915
<i>the wind was out of the sail.</i>

14:33.002 --> 14:35.352
<i>You have one-hit wonders.</i>

14:35.439 --> 14:39.052
<i>You rarely have
one-album wonders.</i>

14:39.139 --> 14:41.141
It's Black Sheep
with some new shit.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.969
You know what I'm saying?
We going to keep it moving.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.274
I know a lot of
people are saying,

14:44.361 --> 14:46.189
yo, where's my man,
Mista Lawnge?

14:46.276 --> 14:48.583
I'm very sad to tell you
that Mista Lawnge

14:48.670 --> 14:51.020
has decided to leave
the group and do his own thing.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.196
But at the end of
the day, love is love,

14:53.283 --> 14:54.719
and I wish him the best.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.373
And we going to keep
it moving, right?

14:56.460 --> 14:59.246
<i>That's right.</i>

14:59.333 --> 15:02.989
<i>At this point, it's
been over 30 years.</i>

15:03.076 --> 15:07.471
<i>I don't spend a lot
of time back there.</i>

15:07.558 --> 15:10.344
<i>I have those memories
of me and Lawnge,</i>

15:10.431 --> 15:13.913
<i>and we're very
congruent onstage.</i>

15:14.000 --> 15:17.177
<i>And we were both able to get
where we both were trying</i>

15:17.264 --> 15:20.963
<i>to go in that moment together.</i>

15:21.050 --> 15:24.314
<i>Once we decided to
go our own ways,</i>

15:24.401 --> 15:26.795
<i>there was no
partner to push you.</i>

15:26.882 --> 15:31.191
<i>It became what
burned internally.</i>

15:31.278 --> 15:35.891
Them two--whatever
kind of wedged them apart,

15:35.978 --> 15:37.501
I don't even know what it was.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.460
I mean, honestly, I don't.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.810
<i>To this day,
I don't know why things</i>

15:41.897 --> 15:43.812
<i>fell off the way they did.</i>

15:43.899 --> 15:45.814
<i>Who knows, man?</i>

15:45.901 --> 15:47.903
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>

15:54.257 --> 15:55.693
To me, getting
your flowers means,

15:55.780 --> 15:57.695
like, you're close to dying.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.175
You know what I'm saying?

15:59.262 --> 16:00.307
Like, all right.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.657
Hey, Ma.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.006
<i>Hey, baby.
How are you?</i>

16:04.093 --> 16:05.790
I'm good.
How are you?

16:05.877 --> 16:07.140
<i>I'm good.</i>

16:07.227 --> 16:08.837
- You in your room?
<i>- Yes.</i>

16:08.924 --> 16:11.405
<i>Okay.
All right, in a minute.</i>

16:16.192 --> 16:17.715
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mama.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.456
How are you?
- Oh, my baby.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.980
How you doing?
- I'm good.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.677
How you doing?
- I'm good.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.679
Mmm.
I love you.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.028
I love you, too.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.377
Wait a minute.
We're on camera now?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.162
We are.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.251
That's okay.
We built for this.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.817
Come on in, now.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.428
You look good, man.

16:34.515 --> 16:35.690
I wouldn't believe
you were in your 70s.

16:35.777 --> 16:36.778
Oh, honey, 70--

16:36.865 --> 16:38.780
Oh, let me tell you.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.738
At the airport,
they said, 75, you don't

16:40.825 --> 16:41.870
have to take your shoes off.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.219
I said, I'll be here next year.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.788
I'll be here.
And I had on boots, too.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.833
I had on my Timbs
because the shoes

16:48.920 --> 16:51.184
I was going to wear tonight--
they come, like, up to here.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.229
I wasn't wearing
them in no airport.

16:53.316 --> 16:54.839
Oh, yeah.
You're not supposed to, Ma.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.624
Mm, I know.
I know.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.279
- They come up to there?
- Yeah, but I got a long skirt.

16:59.366 --> 17:02.108
- You are doing a lot, okay?
- Yeah, because it's you.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.718
You worthy of it.
- I feel that.

17:03.805 --> 17:04.849
<i>That's love.
- Yeah.</i>

17:08.810 --> 17:10.290
What's going on, man?

17:10.377 --> 17:12.292
Okay.
All right.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.207
<i>All right, here we go.</i>

17:14.294 --> 17:16.470
All right, right now
I'm here talking

17:16.557 --> 17:18.341
to one of the legends that's
getting inducted tonight.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.474
<i>It's quite the honor.
You know what I'm saying?</i>

17:20.561 --> 17:22.345
<i>I'm very grateful
to come down to DC,</i>

17:22.432 --> 17:24.086
especially to hang out
with some heads that

17:24.173 --> 17:25.827
know what hip-hop is
all about, represent

17:25.914 --> 17:27.655
<i>the culture to the fullest.</i>

17:27.742 --> 17:29.744
<i>The reason why

17:32.181 --> 17:34.749
for so many years and
accomplishing so much, it is

17:34.836 --> 17:38.753
our obligation as Americans
to give you guys your flowers.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.581
So right now can we get
a big round of applause

17:40.668 --> 17:41.886

Oh, look, y'all, it's
Dres from Black Sheep.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.294
So in the year of
hip-hop's birthday,

17:58.381 --> 18:00.122
what do you feel is
the most important thing

18:00.209 --> 18:02.081
that hip-hop has
contributed to the world

18:02.168 --> 18:04.561
over the last five decades?

18:04.648 --> 18:08.652
Hip-hop is the top-generating
music genre

18:08.739 --> 18:10.611
for how long now?
- A lot of years.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.223
Every corporate entity,
everything, every media,

18:14.310 --> 18:17.139
every medium is all hip-hop.

18:17.226 --> 18:19.794
So why the fuck they don't
respect us in the way

18:19.881 --> 18:21.448
that they should?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.189
They don't uphold
us like they do

18:23.276 --> 18:25.843
these "rock and roll" legends

18:25.930 --> 18:27.802
and soul and whatever, whatever.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.673
We are them right now.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.719
We are the ones selling
millions of records,

18:31.806 --> 18:33.547
streaming millions of records.

18:33.634 --> 18:36.115
We deserve the respect.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.378
Like it or not,
rap is here to stay.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.467
It has become part
of mainstream commerce.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.208
<i>Rap in the '90s--
it's creative.</i>

18:42.295 --> 18:44.471
It's candid.
It's controversial.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.212
Today on the show,
we have rappers

18:46.299 --> 18:49.345
De La Soul to discuss the
many ways to keep it real.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.739
<i>With hip-hop, there's
always been big business.</i>

18:51.826 --> 18:55.264
<i>But mid '90s, us, Dres, Tribe,</i>

18:55.351 --> 18:56.961
we could see it taking over.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.485
Being in this
business, there's

18:58.572 --> 18:59.790
a lot of things
you're going to learn,

18:59.877 --> 19:02.445
and they are screwing our love,
and our love is hip-hop.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.144
You know, our love is rap.
So it's a learning process.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.363
<i>We could see what our
label wanted us to do--</i>

19:07.450 --> 19:10.323
that formula
and how that single,

19:10.410 --> 19:12.934
that one record
needed to be given.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.720
Hip-hop definitely gives us
the opportunity to blow up.

19:19.027 --> 19:22.509
Hip-hop also gives us
the opportunity to implode.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.337
"The Choice Is Yours"--
you were young,

19:24.424 --> 19:26.556
and did you guys do everything
right so that record that

19:26.643 --> 19:29.516
lives today and will
live on forever does

19:29.603 --> 19:31.387
benefit your children and
your children's children?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.563
Like, the deal
wasn't a fair deal...

19:33.650 --> 19:35.739
both: Right.
- Whereas monetarily.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.176
We didn't take a number--

19:37.263 --> 19:38.655
Who would know
those terms, though?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.396
That's the crazy shit.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.876
These are the things that
are kind of common knowledge

19:41.963 --> 19:43.704
that they just don't
share with you.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.575
Well, it's not common because
it's not being shared at all.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.968
Yeah, yeah.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.535
You know, a lot of these
guys got famous--

19:48.622 --> 19:50.798
They're like teen stars.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.974
<i>As a young kid growing up
in New York City,</i>

19:53.061 --> 19:54.323
<i>I loved the music.</i>

19:54.410 --> 19:56.151
<i>I was a fan.
I would go to the clubs.</i>

19:56.238 --> 19:57.979
<i>And you had access
to these people.</i>

19:58.066 --> 20:00.764
And you could see how they
got fucked over business-wise.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.766
<i>Of course, if you're
16, and they're like,</i>

20:02.853 --> 20:04.333
<i>we're going to
give you whatever</i>

20:04.420 --> 20:05.987
to sign this contract,
you're like, fuck it.

20:06.074 --> 20:09.164
You're not thinking Jay-Z,
ownership,

20:09.251 --> 20:10.600
<i>you know, publishing.</i>

20:10.687 --> 20:12.646
<i>This isn't even a formed
genre of music.</i>

20:12.733 --> 20:14.778
And you're like, fuck.
I'm going to make $15,000?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.040
Fuck, yeah.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.390
For as long as
I can remember,

20:17.477 --> 20:19.043
<i>I've been around hip-hop,</i>

20:19.130 --> 20:21.350
<i>as the former editor in chief
at "The Source" magazine.</i>

20:21.437 --> 20:23.526
The business does
get complicated.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.789
You have to understand
the industry

20:25.876 --> 20:27.487
that you're making music in.

20:27.574 --> 20:30.316
It's the key to
survival as you continue

20:30.403 --> 20:32.013
<i>to grow old in the industry</i>

20:32.100 --> 20:33.971
<i>because you're
going to need it.</i>

20:34.058 --> 20:36.887
<i>Dres told me he's
seen old-school rapper</i>

20:36.974 --> 20:38.454
<i>hopping a train, actually.</i>

20:38.541 --> 20:40.195
<i>We was like, yo,
that shit is crazy.</i>

20:40.282 --> 20:42.371
And Dres was like, yo,
I wanted to help him,

20:42.458 --> 20:44.199
but, like, I wasn't really
in the situation--

20:44.286 --> 20:45.679
Like, I ain't with him.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.768
Fuck, I don't want to give
him no fucking $40.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.204
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

20:49.291 --> 20:50.640
I think it's a
concerted effort to try

20:50.727 --> 20:52.338
to take advantage of people.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.165
I'm gonna keep it funky.
You know what I'm saying?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.906
Yeah.
<i>- You got 8, 9 points.</i>

20:55.993 --> 20:57.908
They don't tell you
that that's percentage.

20:57.995 --> 21:01.216
That means there's 90%
that exists

21:01.303 --> 21:03.218
that's not yours
off of what you did.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.220
- What you made.
- Right.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.657
And God forbid
you splitting it.

21:07.744 --> 21:11.922
I should be a multimillionaire
if they just gave me half.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.011
Black Sheep were
an integral part

21:14.098 --> 21:16.492
of early 1990s
renaissance hip-hop

21:16.579 --> 21:18.407
coming out
of the Five Boroughs.

21:18.494 --> 21:20.322
As part of The Native Tongue collective,

21:20.409 --> 21:23.194
Dres and his DJ, Mista Lawnge,
embody the spirit

21:23.282 --> 21:25.196
of that group of musicians.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.983
But they maintained their own
style and approach to music.

21:29.070 --> 21:32.508
And in 1997, Dres dropped
his first solo project.

21:32.595 --> 21:35.946
As well, he has released
independent music and material

21:36.033 --> 21:38.079
as recently as last year.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.820
Give it up for Dres.

21:42.431 --> 21:43.693
♪ Yes, it's me ♪

21:43.780 --> 21:45.434
♪ D-R-E-S ♪

21:45.521 --> 21:48.219
- All right.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.918
For me, music is
all-encompassing.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.921
It's a beautiful reason
to wake up every day.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.923
It's a strong reason

21:56.010 --> 21:59.579
to learn to correct yourself

21:59.666 --> 22:01.276
because we're all going
to make the mistakes

22:01.363 --> 22:02.582
that we're going to make.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.453
That's what life is.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.674
But be defined by
what you correct.

22:09.850 --> 22:14.507
I'm working on some really,
really, really new dope shit.

22:14.594 --> 22:17.858
This particular project
is a DnD project--

22:17.945 --> 22:20.295
Dilla and Dres.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.514
All right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.081
It's happening.
It's going down.

22:24.168 --> 22:27.563
Like, I've been allowed
to visit

22:27.650 --> 22:29.565
a sacred land

22:29.652 --> 22:33.047
and pull a project

22:33.134 --> 22:35.441
produced entirely by J Dilla.

22:35.528 --> 22:39.488
And I'm asking all of y'all

22:39.575 --> 22:41.316
to see that star
when it shines,

22:41.403 --> 22:43.710
'cause it's going to shine.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.625
You know what I'm saying?
That's my word.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.496
I'm just asking you to pay
attention a little bit.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.759
You know what I'm saying?
Word up.

22:54.721 --> 22:57.637
How y'all feeling?

22:57.724 --> 22:59.116
I can't hear y'all.

22:59.203 --> 23:03.120
How y'all feeling, man?

23:03.207 --> 23:06.297
Want to take it back?
- Way back, back into time.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.476
Okay.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.913
Real quick.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.568
Yes, we--
Yo!

23:19.876 --> 23:23.097
<i>I only recall meeting Dilla
one time</i>

23:23.184 --> 23:26.100
<i>in passing in life,</i>

23:26.187 --> 23:30.365
<i>though he worked with everyone
of the Natives--</i>

23:30.452 --> 23:32.585
<i>very close with Tribe.</i>

23:32.672 --> 23:35.152
<i>You know, he did a lot
of work with De La.</i>

23:35.239 --> 23:37.198
When I make my music--
you know what I'm saying?--

23:37.285 --> 23:39.069
I want people to
feel what I feel.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.290
I want them to feel that energy
that I--whatever it was.

23:42.377 --> 23:43.683
Yeah, that's all it is,

23:43.770 --> 23:45.467
because I make
it straight from the heart.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.816
<i>♪ Stakes is high ♪</i>

23:46.903 --> 23:48.644
<i>♪ You know them
stakes is high ♪</i>

23:48.731 --> 23:51.430
<i>JD from Detroit
was definitely one</i>

23:51.517 --> 23:54.781
of the illest producers ever.

23:54.868 --> 23:57.827
<i>J Dilla was truly one
of the purest musicians</i>

23:57.914 --> 23:59.394
<i>I've ever met.</i>

23:59.481 --> 24:01.135
<i>Dilla came with
his own sound,</i>

24:01.222 --> 24:03.964
<i>his own beat, his own pace,
his own scratches,</i>

24:04.051 --> 24:05.400
<i>his own melodies.</i>

24:05.487 --> 24:07.837
And then he started
working with everybody.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.578
<i>He worked
with so many people,</i>

24:09.665 --> 24:12.015
<i>from The Pharcyde, to Tribe...</i>

24:12.102 --> 24:13.147
<i>De La Soul.</i>

24:13.234 --> 24:14.714
<i>The Roots, Erykah Badu.</i>

24:14.801 --> 24:17.325
<i>Busta Rhymes,
Janet Jackson.</i>

24:17.412 --> 24:18.500
<i>And he from Detroit.</i>

24:18.587 --> 24:21.851
So we like,
that's our guy.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.593
A significant role in
hip-hop is the sampling.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.943
And one of the best to
ever do it is J Dilla.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.858
<i>All I know how to
do is work the MPC</i>

24:28.945 --> 24:30.904
and listen to these
breakbeats and chop shit.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.819
<i>You know what I'm saying?
I come from that hip-hop shit.</i>

24:32.906 --> 24:35.822
<i>What he was doing was
merging jazz...</i>

24:35.909 --> 24:39.303
<i>funk, soul.</i>

24:39.390 --> 24:43.220
He was flipping any
record, anything.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.093
<i>The pieces of the record
that he would sample--</i>

24:46.180 --> 24:47.921
<i>it would be the same
record you sampled,</i>

24:48.008 --> 24:50.140
but he would find a
piece in that shit

24:50.227 --> 24:51.707
that you would never
even think to use

24:51.794 --> 24:54.101
<i>or couldn't even
use it that way.</i>

24:54.188 --> 24:56.843
<i>He could make a Soca record,
a reggae record,</i>

24:56.930 --> 24:58.584
an R&B record.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.499
It was just in a way that
no one else would do.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.501
<i>And I mean, effortlessly.</i>

25:02.588 --> 25:05.286
Like, yeah, he did hip-hop,
but he's way bigger than that.

25:05.373 --> 25:07.418
He's a jazz musician.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.942
<i>He knew his time signature.</i>

25:09.029 --> 25:10.857
<i>He was programming it,</i>

25:10.944 --> 25:12.946
<i>but it just felt live,
the swing of it.</i>

25:13.033 --> 25:15.252
<i>He had an understanding of
it that he could manipulate it</i>

25:15.339 --> 25:16.863
<i>any way that he wanted to.</i>

25:16.950 --> 25:18.908
He was like, truly,
a scientist at it.

25:18.995 --> 25:21.432
Artists like Dilla
gave us a new voice,

25:21.520 --> 25:24.305
currency, a relevancy.

25:24.392 --> 25:27.351
<i>And that's real raw
talent right there.</i>

25:27.438 --> 25:29.397
And that's why we still talking
about him--because his beats

25:29.484 --> 25:31.225
got us still talking.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.888
<i>Went out to Puerto Rico
to do a charity event,</i>

25:41.975 --> 25:45.805
<i>and I was blessed
to meet Ma Dukes.</i>

25:45.892 --> 25:48.938
Can't never get enough
bell pepper and onion.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.637
Let's see, finish cooking
this sauce.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.682
<i>And I was offered
an opportunity</i>

25:53.769 --> 25:55.292
<i>to come back to their house...</i>

25:55.379 --> 25:57.468
Keep my pasta loose.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.558
<i>For a meal and, you know,
just sit up and listen</i>

25:59.645 --> 26:01.255
<i>to music, this, that,
and the other.</i>

26:01.342 --> 26:04.171
Welcome to the hot kitchen.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.782
<i>Dilla--he didn't have
a lot of freedom as a kid.</i>

26:06.869 --> 26:08.610
And, you know, at that time,
you could go to a record shop,

26:08.697 --> 26:10.656
you hear
something playing new.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.048
Because he was such
a great kid during the week,

26:12.135 --> 26:14.790
when his dad worked, he
got to get record or two.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.706
You know, he'd do that--
build his record collection.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.622
<i>He was exceptionally gifted.</i>

26:20.709 --> 26:23.930
<i>He could take anything apart.
He was mechanically inclined.</i>

26:24.017 --> 26:25.279
<i>Everybody liked him.</i>

26:25.366 --> 26:26.933
But he wasn't outgoing.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.413
And if he didn't say
anything or didn't speak,

26:29.500 --> 26:31.328
it was just because his
mind was, like--

26:31.415 --> 26:33.156
his head was
in a different space.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.506
Everything is like done
through math and science,

26:35.594 --> 26:37.465
even with the music, you know.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.816
Was used to hearing
music of all genres--

26:40.903 --> 26:44.733
<i>Mr. Yancey, who had been a
musician for over 25 years</i>

26:44.820 --> 26:47.127
<i>professionally,
as well as his job</i>

26:47.214 --> 26:50.130
<i>at Ford Motor Company
for 40 years</i>

26:50.217 --> 26:52.828
<i>before he passed away.</i>

26:52.915 --> 26:57.224
We entertained
a lot of musicians.

26:57.311 --> 27:01.315
<i>When Dilla was a baby,
at 11 months old,</i>

27:01.402 --> 27:04.013
<i>he would hear James Brown
record come on.</i>

27:04.100 --> 27:07.626
<i>And within the third beat,
he'd be up dancing.</i>

27:07.713 --> 27:09.758
<i>But he had not
learned to walk yet,</i>

27:09.845 --> 27:12.587
and he's in a whole
different world.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.417
So music had him early on.

27:18.114 --> 27:20.334
- If I can get my folder.
- All right.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.597
A lot of stuff was floating
around on the Internet

27:22.684 --> 27:24.468
because it wasn't
released properly.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.080
And so I had to
encrypt a lot of stuff.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.690
Why?

27:28.777 --> 27:31.258
'Cause folks are always
wanting to do music projects

27:31.345 --> 27:33.739
with us, yet they're
using songs that they

27:33.826 --> 27:35.131
don't have permission to use.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.568
It's the legal stuff that
I got to take care of.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.223
But the music--being
back home with the family

27:40.310 --> 27:42.573
makes all of that
so much easier.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.446
<i>The guy basically
chopped my record.</i>

27:45.533 --> 27:47.056
<i>It got around--
bootleg versions.</i>

27:47.143 --> 27:48.275
And that was a big hit.

27:48.362 --> 27:49.624
It was my fucking beats.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.365
- Your tune?
- Yeah.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.236
And it's like--that was
kind of in the beginning--

27:53.323 --> 27:55.021
you know what I'm saying--
when I learned about that shit.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.196
And people can
just take your shit

27:56.283 --> 27:58.198
and sample it and rap over it.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.155

<i>me going and taking

wouldn't let her do nothing.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.157

37:03.438 --> 37:06.920
but I have to treat it
as if Prodigy is here.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.052
<i>It's like, okay, you get
this amount of money.</i>

37:09.139 --> 37:10.532
<i>And you get that
amount of money.</i>

37:10.619 --> 37:13.840
And let's just
honor our loved one.

37:13.927 --> 37:17.626
<i>We humbly learned the down
effects of the music business.</i>

37:17.713 --> 37:19.280
<i>We learned that.</i>

37:19.367 --> 37:20.890
<i>Yeah, it's a difficult--</i>

37:20.977 --> 37:22.675
<i>I can't even speak
on the situation.</i>

37:22.762 --> 37:24.807
I hope it gets rectified, man.
I hope--

37:24.894 --> 37:27.375
<i>The importance of
making sure everything</i>

37:27.462 --> 37:29.116
<i>is clear with this particular
project is because</i>

37:29.203 --> 37:31.640
you've had so many people
using Dilla's

37:31.727 --> 37:35.296
music without permission,
putting it out.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.386
And then they wonder--you
come back to us and asking us,

37:38.473 --> 37:40.606
how come my song
got taken down?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.085
Like, what happened?

37:42.172 --> 37:44.044
I put out a good
project and everything

37:44.131 --> 37:48.222
that people think that it's
okay to take someone's property

37:48.309 --> 37:51.660
and utilize it for your benefit

37:51.747 --> 37:53.575
without having permission.

37:53.662 --> 37:55.273
Oh, yeah?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.667
Like, and naming it
DnD, Dilla and Dres,

37:58.754 --> 38:02.889
like, I felt like it was
important that we bond,

38:02.976 --> 38:06.109
that this is an opportunity
to be the difference in some

38:06.196 --> 38:08.982
of the stuff that
gets questioned

38:09.069 --> 38:10.679
and some of the stuff
that gets acknowledged.

38:10.766 --> 38:13.595
DnD is something
that, you know, like--

38:13.682 --> 38:14.988
I'll put like this.

38:15.075 --> 38:16.859
When we did
"The Choice Is Yours,"

38:16.946 --> 38:18.731
I'm standing in front of the
mixing board next to Lawnge,

38:18.818 --> 38:22.387
and I'm like, I don't
know what we just did,

38:22.474 --> 38:24.302
but I know we just
did something.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.391
- Word.
- And that's how I feel.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.221
<i>There is a pressure
that I put upon myself,</i>

38:31.309 --> 38:32.919
<i>if anything, I think.</i>

38:33.006 --> 38:34.660
These people that
love your son...

38:34.747 --> 38:36.575
Yeah.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.707
They're looking at me like,
and you're about to do what?

38:41.275 --> 38:43.233
He's gone, but his
music is still here.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.844
- Right.
- You've been given the idea.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.367
You've been given the talent.

38:46.454 --> 38:49.065
You've been blessed
to make this approach

38:49.152 --> 38:53.287
and shine more light on what
and who he was from people

38:53.374 --> 38:54.375
that knew him best.
- Yeah.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.421
I think
that's very important.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.031
You know, it's going to be
a lot of those people

38:58.118 --> 38:59.902
that really don't know
how to feel.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.209
It's a lot of those people
that were close to him

39:02.296 --> 39:04.690
that are still mourning him.
- Right.

39:04.777 --> 39:08.563
You can't be afraid
to take that step.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.739
Let them have a taste of Dilla,
you know,

39:10.826 --> 39:13.263
and show them--so you've
got to give it to them.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.004
That's real.
That's what we about to do.

39:15.091 --> 39:16.484
Exactly, exactly.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.978
<i>One of the things that's
really important to me</i>

39:32.065 --> 39:34.459
<i>in the making of this
project is Dilla's approval.</i>

39:34.546 --> 39:38.288
<i>And all of that doesn't
take place any other way</i>

39:38.376 --> 39:40.769
<i>without me learning about him.</i>

39:40.856 --> 39:44.120
<i>I wasn't going to get
a phone call from Dilla.</i>

39:44.207 --> 39:47.210
<i>I had to take the initiative
to find him.</i>

39:47.297 --> 39:50.562
<i>I had to take the initiative
to find his friends.</i>

39:50.649 --> 39:52.564
<i>Where's Frank?
Oh, wait--Frank, Frank.</i>

39:52.651 --> 39:54.043
I'm here.
Frank is here.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.306
How y'all doing?
Holla at your boy.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.308
Dilla, tell me if you remember
this--when we was in the...

39:58.396 --> 40:01.094
<i>Frank Nitty was
Dilla's right hand.</i>

40:01.181 --> 40:04.750
Frank was always there,
and he cared about Dilla.

40:04.837 --> 40:06.360
<i>Seven years
I put out records.</i>

40:06.447 --> 40:08.188
Everything I put
out was a J Dilla track.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.146
<i>Everybody needs that
guy to hold him down,</i>

40:10.233 --> 40:12.018
and that was him.

It's dope that you taking the
time to get a little history.

40:43.658 --> 40:46.356
But if he was here
and we was doing this,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.663
I probably would've been
in his car picking you up

40:48.750 --> 40:50.926
from the airport
to come do the work,

40:51.013 --> 40:53.059
because that's how it went
down, you know what I'm saying?

40:53.146 --> 40:55.235
I'm so grateful for it, man.

40:55.322 --> 40:57.063
Dres, my mom wants you.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.717
And he's extremely humble.

40:58.804 --> 40:59.892
He's a good guy.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.633
Don't let his humble fool you.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.733
<i>One thing about
being from Detroit</i>

41:14.820 --> 41:17.475
and being from the '80s or
the '90s, in particular--

41:17.562 --> 41:18.824
I would say it's
an acquired taste.

41:18.911 --> 41:21.914
Jalen Rose from
the University of Michigan.

41:22.001 --> 41:23.655
That's where I can
help him a whole lot,

41:23.742 --> 41:25.265
and that's what I'm
looking to do from day one.

41:25.352 --> 41:26.919
<i>Detroit's an
industrial giant.</i>

41:27.006 --> 41:28.660
<i>I mean, it's changed
over the decades.</i>

41:28.747 --> 41:30.575
<i>Largest automobile
plant in the world.</i>

41:30.662 --> 41:32.751
<i>Detroit was a thriving
city in the '70s.</i>

41:32.838 --> 41:35.493
<i>Chevrolet, Ford, and Chrysler
manufacturing cars,</i>

41:35.580 --> 41:37.712
<i>and we also had
Motown Records.</i>

41:37.799 --> 41:41.194
And music and cars
became our heartbeat.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.675
<i>Detroit leads the nation
in violent crime.</i>

41:43.762 --> 41:45.503
<i>It started to change
in the '80s</i>

41:45.590 --> 41:48.506
<i>as the crack epidemic hit,
and it went on the decline.</i>

41:48.593 --> 41:50.638
<i>It's a diamond in the rough.</i>

41:50.725 --> 41:52.771
<i>It's just really,
really rough.</i>

41:52.858 --> 41:55.730
<i>And I think Dilla applied that
hustle and smarts</i>

41:55.817 --> 41:57.297
<i>to music.</i>

41:57.384 --> 41:59.865
<i>I don't know.</i>

41:59.952 --> 42:01.867
I wonder how he would
feel to see this--

42:01.954 --> 42:03.825
to know that, you know,
at some point,

42:03.912 --> 42:05.261
people in your city
kind of caught up to it.

42:05.348 --> 42:07.133
Right, right.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.787

could have its own category.

43:04.233 --> 43:07.193
Nobody else created
beats like that, you know,

43:07.280 --> 43:10.326

43:10.413 --> 43:14.853
<i>Years ago--it must have

man, I hear that music

43:18.465 --> 43:20.119
coming out of the house.

43:20.206 --> 43:21.294
You got equipment down there?
You making music?

43:21.381 --> 43:22.991
I said, yep, I do.

43:23.078 --> 43:25.777
He brought the music
that he had been creating

43:25.864 --> 43:28.693
from beat matching
with cassettes,

43:28.780 --> 43:31.609
and that's how it all started.

43:31.696 --> 43:35.830
<i>At that point, I taught
him how to use the MPC.</i>

43:35.917 --> 43:37.745
<i>It was watching
a light bulb go off.</i>

43:37.832 --> 43:39.529
<i>It was, like,
a dream come true</i>

43:39.617 --> 43:41.488
<i>to finally be able to
manipulate music like this</i>

43:41.575 --> 43:42.663
<i>and put it together so fast.</i>

43:45.710 --> 43:48.800
So then he left stuff like this
that I have in the machine.

43:48.887 --> 43:53.021
That's cool--that
I'll still have.

44:07.209 --> 44:08.471
Crazy.

44:08.558 --> 44:10.169
So there's probably

44:10.256 --> 44:12.084
about six other keyboard sounds
like that,

44:12.171 --> 44:15.000
where he played the chords
with just one note.

44:15.087 --> 44:17.524
That showed you
how great his ear was...

44:21.223 --> 44:23.661
<i>Just the fact that
all these keyboard songs--</i>

44:23.748 --> 44:25.663
<i>that just one chord--</i>

44:25.750 --> 44:27.665
<i>he sampled it, and then
played it on the pad.</i>

44:27.752 --> 44:30.624
Nobody else was doing that.

44:30.711 --> 44:33.235

44:33.322 --> 44:35.411
- Probably about 12, 13.

Mother cooking
for me upstairs.

46:27.654 --> 46:30.004
<i>He's like, use my records.
I don't care what you use.</i>

46:30.091 --> 46:32.311
Pete Rock is in my house, man,
making beats.

46:32.398 --> 46:33.834
<i>It's like two giants--</i>

46:33.921 --> 46:35.488
<i>the Hulk and The Thing
just chilling out,</i>

46:35.575 --> 46:37.316
<i>teaching each other.</i>

46:37.403 --> 46:40.275
And we became real fast,
talking to each other like--

46:40.362 --> 46:41.799
you know?

46:41.886 --> 46:43.278
- I mean, I got all that shit.
- Right.

46:43.365 --> 46:45.498
I had that shit.
I just wanted to get some--

46:45.585 --> 46:47.805
<i>He has this process,
a way of hooking up drums,</i>

46:47.892 --> 46:49.545
<i>making the drums
sound like they sound.</i>

46:49.632 --> 46:52.287
That's it. He plays the
record, or he hears something.

46:52.374 --> 46:54.333
Oh.

46:54.420 --> 46:55.682
Puts it in the machine.

46:55.769 --> 46:57.423
Hears something else--oh.

46:57.510 --> 46:58.859
I'm watching all these
things, and I'm like,

46:58.946 --> 47:00.469
this is alchemy.

47:00.556 --> 47:03.385
This is fucking science
what's going on right here.

47:03.472 --> 47:06.911
That's what makes it special,
as well as all the music

47:06.998 --> 47:09.914
and all the stars
and celebrities

47:10.001 --> 47:12.220
that pulled up in our hood
to come get that work.

47:12.307 --> 47:14.092
You know what I mean?

47:14.179 --> 47:15.397
<i>- They all came down to the D.
- They came to the D.</i>

47:15.484 --> 47:17.138
They all came to the D.
That's what I'm saying.

47:17.225 --> 47:18.183
I'm still a fan of
this hip-hop shit.

47:18.270 --> 47:19.793
You know what I'm saying?

47:19.880 --> 47:21.839
Shit like that--it's
still part of the dream.

47:21.926 --> 47:24.624
It's still part of the--
I can't believe it.

47:24.711 --> 47:26.844
<i>♪ Putting it
on the map for the D ♪</i>

47:26.931 --> 47:29.890
Yo.
DJ Dez.

47:31.631 --> 47:33.763
<i>I feel like I represent
something special, man.</i>

47:33.851 --> 47:35.591
<i>I'm proud of the era.</i>

47:35.678 --> 47:39.682
<i>I'm proud of the cast
that I came in with--</i>

47:39.769 --> 47:41.206
<i>a lot of history.</i>

47:41.293 --> 47:43.121
Finally, that's word.

47:43.208 --> 47:44.774
First of all, how
did you meet Dilla?

47:44.862 --> 47:47.299
We met at Amp's house.

47:47.386 --> 47:49.997
You just feel like you
at the right place--

47:50.084 --> 47:52.826
you know what I'm saying--
or right moment.

47:52.913 --> 47:56.090
You know when you in the midst
of somebody that's special.

47:57.962 --> 48:01.182
I felt like we was going
to take over the world.

48:01.269 --> 48:03.141
I felt like
that was my partner.

48:03.228 --> 48:06.013
We was aliens, and we was going
to take over the world.

48:06.100 --> 48:07.754
Right, right, right, right.

48:07.841 --> 48:11.105
I get it, because since
I kind of started this project

48:11.192 --> 48:13.151
and announced that I'm
doing this project,

48:13.238 --> 48:16.458
the energy around it
kind of goes throughout

48:16.545 --> 48:19.722
my entire sphere of awareness.

48:19.809 --> 48:21.463
You know what I'm saying?

48:21.550 --> 48:23.161
Like, everything around me
became kind of charged.

48:23.248 --> 48:24.553
You know what I'm saying?

48:24.640 --> 48:25.728
- It's special.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:25.815 --> 48:27.165
It's a special dynamic.

48:27.252 --> 48:29.471
Yeah, it is a very
special dynamic.

48:36.435 --> 48:38.393
Hmm.

48:41.396 --> 48:43.485
Keep the passion, man.

48:43.572 --> 48:45.270
You might run
into an obstacle.

48:49.013 --> 48:52.842
Just keep the passion, because...

48:52.930 --> 48:55.062
you know,
this past can get tricky.

48:57.804 --> 49:01.373
And it's just...
- Right.

49:06.073 --> 49:08.684
Things become way more
complicated after you gone.

49:13.080 --> 49:16.475
<i>He came back
from tour 2000--</i>

49:16.562 --> 49:18.651
from UK.

49:18.738 --> 49:20.522
He just wasn't feeling good.

49:20.609 --> 49:23.177
So, during his hospital
stay that we thought

49:23.264 --> 49:25.179
was going to be just
for observation,

49:25.266 --> 49:26.964
<i>it ends up being a couple
months because he has</i>

49:27.051 --> 49:29.531
<i>to have dialysis, you know?</i>

49:29.618 --> 49:33.927
<i>And he had lupus, which was
a very rare blood disease.</i>

49:34.014 --> 49:38.018
And I think they said it
was one in...

49:38.105 --> 49:40.978
10,000,000.

49:41.065 --> 49:43.632
<i>J Dilla was like
my roommate out here.</i>

49:43.719 --> 49:45.591
<i>So I would go home
every day, and he</i>

49:45.678 --> 49:48.855
<i>would be working on his MPC,
making beats, creating magic.</i>

49:48.942 --> 49:50.726
<i>And then eventually
he got sick,</i>

49:50.813 --> 49:52.598
<i>I'd watch him, you know,
physically deteriorating.</i>

49:56.689 --> 49:58.299
<i>The first time I seen him
in a wheelchair</i>

49:58.386 --> 49:59.779
was when he rolled
off the plane.

49:59.866 --> 50:01.563
It was basically
his last tour.

50:01.650 --> 50:05.524
What up, doe?

50:05.611 --> 50:06.829
What up, doe?

50:06.916 --> 50:09.484
Yeah!

50:09.571 --> 50:12.574
<i>And I'm not gonna act like
there's anything different.</i>

50:12.661 --> 50:14.794
You know, it's still Dilla.
What up, boy?

50:14.881 --> 50:16.665
You know, it's still that.

50:16.752 --> 50:19.538
<i>The only thing I did ask him
was, yo, we been filming.</i>

50:19.625 --> 50:22.976
<i>If you don't want to be on
camera, tell me now, you know.</i>

50:23.063 --> 50:25.413
No, film that shit.
Film that shit.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.808
It's a blessing to
be out here right now

50:28.895 --> 50:31.854
bringing you this celebration--
that's what it is.

50:31.941 --> 50:34.031
Retrospect, he knew.

50:34.118 --> 50:36.120
He knew his time was coming.

50:36.207 --> 50:38.165
He even brought his
moms to see you all.

50:38.252 --> 50:41.647
Make some motherfucking noise!

50:41.734 --> 50:45.825
He didn't take anything
that day, but he's hurting,

50:45.912 --> 50:47.914
I can imagine, all over.

50:48.001 --> 50:50.047
- It's Ma Dukes, y'all.
- Bring Ma Dukes to the stage.

50:51.657 --> 50:54.964
<i>That last night
before he passed away,</i>

50:55.052 --> 50:59.360
he's finishing up
his last project.

50:59.447 --> 51:03.364
<i>Now all I got to do is
get the bass line, he says.</i>

51:03.451 --> 51:05.453
<i>In his hospital bed,
you know,</i>

51:05.540 --> 51:07.368
<i>with his little
crate of records,</i>

51:07.455 --> 51:09.544
<i>little, small
little turntable,</i>

51:09.631 --> 51:12.286
I'm sick, possibly dying.

51:14.332 --> 51:16.421
Where's my MPC?

51:16.508 --> 51:19.598
<i>That's a whole
other mind state.</i>

51:19.685 --> 51:21.600
<i>It was something that
I didn't want to accept,</i>

51:21.687 --> 51:24.733
<i>that he was losing himself.</i>

51:27.562 --> 51:31.653
Even as I'm holding him, he
just had a breath in my arm.

51:31.740 --> 51:33.960
But that breath that I felt
was his last breath,

51:34.047 --> 51:35.309
and he died in my arms.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.532
<i>I had so much love and so
many people supporting me</i>

51:40.619 --> 51:43.056
around me.

51:43.143 --> 51:45.450
<i>Eventually I'll come home,
and he's not there no more.</i>

51:45.537 --> 51:48.496
<i>So his spirit is still
here, and he's living</i>

51:48.583 --> 51:50.716
<i>forever through the music.</i>

51:50.803 --> 51:54.328
<i>It's just that dedication.</i>

51:54.415 --> 51:56.374
<i>Everybody can't be
on that type of time.</i>

51:56.461 --> 51:59.899
- Thank you all for coming out.

51:59.986 --> 52:02.597
I love you all, man.

52:05.687 --> 52:07.994
Too young...

52:08.081 --> 52:09.604
died too young.

52:20.572 --> 52:22.922
<i>When we started coming
here, he was digging.</i>

52:23.009 --> 52:25.229
Now, they got memorabilia,
T-shirts, all that, but...

52:27.100 --> 52:28.797
It is ice cold.

52:28.884 --> 52:30.147
Shit.

52:32.540 --> 52:35.239
I've been here so many times.
You have no idea.

52:35.326 --> 52:36.892
Even after I had records,
we still would come in here,

52:36.979 --> 52:38.198
and he would dig.

52:38.285 --> 52:39.982
And we had, you know,
singles out.

52:40.069 --> 52:42.942
Our singles would
be here on the wall.

52:43.029 --> 52:44.987
There go Dilla's
signature right there.

52:45.074 --> 52:46.859
- All right.
- Yep.

52:46.946 --> 52:49.078
"Jay Dee, Slum Village."

52:49.166 --> 52:52.299
And then if we go all
the way down over here,

52:52.386 --> 52:54.171
you'll find your boy Nitty...

52:54.258 --> 52:55.650
- All right.
- Right there.

52:55.737 --> 52:57.217
That's what's up.

52:57.304 --> 52:58.871
- You want to go above Quest?
- Okay, sounds good.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.177
- That good?
- Yeah.

53:03.310 --> 53:05.051
All right.
- Thank you.

53:05.138 --> 53:07.184
I feel honored.

53:07.271 --> 53:08.533
<i>You know what's
a good example?</i>

53:08.620 --> 53:10.099
<i>Check with--what is it--</i>

53:10.187 --> 53:12.624
"Why I Got To Be Like That,"
Pharcyde, okay?

53:12.711 --> 53:16.410
And then listen
to "Do For Love" by Tupac.

53:16.497 --> 53:20.109
<i>J, he took record digging
to a whole nother level.</i>

53:20.197 --> 53:25.158
I mean, he would come in,
literally sit down,

53:25.245 --> 53:27.900
grab the most obscure
jazz album

53:27.987 --> 53:30.381
that you could
actually think of,

53:30.468 --> 53:33.558
and he would play
X amount of songs.

53:33.645 --> 53:38.040
His knowledge was
just a joy to behold.

53:38.127 --> 53:39.868
<i>The last three years,
all production,</i>

53:39.955 --> 53:41.609
just trying to get my name out.

53:41.696 --> 53:43.568
I still consider myself
underground, very underground.

53:43.655 --> 53:47.224
I want to get across there
and still do what I do.

53:47.311 --> 53:50.314
You know, and Detroit
is the type of city

53:50.401 --> 53:54.143
where, if you
don't come correct,

53:54.231 --> 53:56.102
you will be called out for it.

53:56.189 --> 53:58.757
I mean, talk about no-fly zone.

53:58.844 --> 54:00.193
Krrrr!

54:00.280 --> 54:01.760
That's how bad it is.

54:01.847 --> 54:04.110
You know, don't let the
smooth taste fool you.

54:04.197 --> 54:05.807
We handle our own around here.

54:05.894 --> 54:07.635
But we also praise...

54:07.722 --> 54:08.984
When it's done correctly?

54:09.071 --> 54:11.204
When it's done correct, yes.

54:11.291 --> 54:12.945
Oh, most definitely.

54:13.032 --> 54:15.339
Excellent, because that's
what this is all about.

54:15.426 --> 54:16.992
This is all about
doing it correctly.

54:21.301 --> 54:24.739
<i>It has a weirdness to it.</i>

54:24.826 --> 54:27.438
<i>I could definitely
sense, you know,</i>

54:27.525 --> 54:30.658
<i>the territorial
aspect of people's</i>

54:30.745 --> 54:33.095
relationships with Dilla--
that I didn't have this.

54:33.182 --> 54:34.358
You know, I wasn't in the room.

54:34.445 --> 54:36.273
I wasn't there.
You know, I get it.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.753
I would be a little territorial
as well probably.

54:40.886 --> 54:42.235
Yo...

54:46.544 --> 54:48.415
Oh, wow.

54:48.502 --> 54:50.591
Man.

54:50.678 --> 54:53.551
That's kind of
the energy that--

54:53.638 --> 54:55.553
you know, like, the energy
that exists around this

54:55.640 --> 54:59.296
is very elusive.

54:59.383 --> 55:01.254
Yeah.

55:01.341 --> 55:05.084
Ask her, you know, if
I may, what happened?

55:17.879 --> 55:20.621
<i>Even if she don't do it,
whoever she talking to,</i>

55:20.708 --> 55:23.320
she should be armed with the
truth about the situation.

55:23.407 --> 55:24.973
They don't know if I'm a
piece of shit trying to take

55:25.060 --> 55:26.235
advantage of a situation.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.802
Why should I trust you?

55:27.889 --> 55:29.369
So whatever
the fuck they saying...

55:29.456 --> 55:32.851
Yeah, and I'm definitely
trying not to...

55:32.938 --> 55:36.071
take anything personal.

55:36.158 --> 55:38.378
It's not even
a "fuck you" thing.

55:40.815 --> 55:44.253
<i>It's a "what the fuck
are you doing?" thing.</i>

55:57.745 --> 55:59.660
<i>Hey, Dres.</i>

55:59.747 --> 56:01.619
<i>What's going on?</i>

56:01.706 --> 56:04.839
<i>So I just got off the phone
with Toney and Ma's attorney.</i>

56:04.926 --> 56:06.275
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

56:06.363 --> 56:07.929
<i>And there seems
to be a little bit</i>

56:08.016 --> 56:10.889
<i>of hesitancy on their part
about this project,</i>

56:10.976 --> 56:13.282
<i>in general.</i>

56:13.370 --> 56:16.373
<i>This is coming from--</i>

56:16.460 --> 56:18.549
<i>it's coming from left field.</i>

56:18.636 --> 56:20.725
<i>- I'm sorry.
- This is news to me.</i>

56:20.812 --> 56:22.727
<i>Yeah, do you have
anything signed</i>

56:22.814 --> 56:24.685
<i>with them at this point?</i>

56:24.772 --> 56:27.427
<i>Remember when we were
first putting this together?</i>

56:27.514 --> 56:28.950
<i>- Yeah.
- You told me--</i>

56:29.037 --> 56:31.431
<i>let's clarify everything
going on with the music.</i>

56:31.518 --> 56:35.609
<i>But the music--it was
done on the goodwill</i>

56:35.696 --> 56:37.655
<i>of me, Toney, and Ma.
- Okay.</i>

56:37.742 --> 56:40.397
<i>I've been moving forward
and speaking like--</i>

56:40.484 --> 56:44.662
<i>like I had Ma's blessings--
that they allowed me to do</i>

56:44.749 --> 56:46.011
<i>this from the very beginning.</i>

56:46.098 --> 56:48.187
<i>Yeah, look, Dres, if I'm
understanding correctly,</i>

56:48.274 --> 56:50.885
<i>you haven't had a chance
to paper up a deal yet</i>

56:50.972 --> 56:52.409
<i>for the album
itself, right?</i>

56:52.496 --> 56:55.107
<i>I'm the only one that's
spent money in the creation</i>

56:55.194 --> 56:56.151
<i>of this project.</i>

56:56.238 --> 56:58.197
<i>No one else has.</i>

56:58.284 --> 57:00.112
<i>I've spent thousands
upon thousands of dollars</i>

57:00.199 --> 57:03.245
<i>creating this, getting
all kinds of features.</i>

57:03.332 --> 57:07.336
<i>And I was under the assumption
that, in good faith,</i>

57:07.424 --> 57:08.990
<i>they're my partners.</i>

57:09.077 --> 57:10.775
<i>They represent
Dilla's interests.</i>

57:10.862 --> 57:13.299
<i>J Dilla is the producer,
and I'm the MC.</i>

57:13.386 --> 57:15.257
<i>I got--that
makes total sense.</i>

57:15.344 --> 57:18.217
<i>I know a lot of things get
lost in translation sometimes.</i>

57:18.304 --> 57:21.829
<i>I think Toney might
have maybe misconstrued--</i>

57:21.916 --> 57:24.528
<i>Like, I even asked
her on film, you know,</i>

57:24.615 --> 57:27.269
<i>why did she give me
permission to do this?</i>

57:27.356 --> 57:30.185
<i>And the answer, you know,
was heartwarming.</i>

57:30.272 --> 57:32.231
<i>I don't understand where
this is coming from.</i>

57:32.318 --> 57:35.452
<i>Look, I'm not sure if
this is a game or a tactic,</i>

57:35.539 --> 57:37.454
<i>but I'm just doing my best</i>

57:37.541 --> 57:39.151
<i>to kind of alleviate
their concerns.</i>

57:39.238 --> 57:42.807
<i>So the sooner we get something
in writing that outlines</i>

57:42.894 --> 57:45.200
<i>exactly what this
relationship is</i>

57:45.287 --> 57:46.898
<i>and exactly what you guys
are doing, the better.</i>

57:46.985 --> 57:48.465
<i>Well, let's put
it under contract.</i>

57:48.552 --> 57:49.988
<i>I hope we can figure this out.</i>

57:50.075 --> 57:52.991
<i>I don't know where
they went off track.</i>

57:53.078 --> 57:57.212
<i>I literally look at them like
an extension of my family</i>

57:57.299 --> 57:58.605
<i>at this point.</i>

57:58.692 --> 58:00.433
<i>But...</i>

58:00.520 --> 58:02.566
<i>It sounds like you really
need to talk to a lawyer.</i>

58:02.653 --> 58:03.697
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:03.784 --> 58:05.264
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

58:35.512 --> 58:37.731
<i>What's really fascinating
in the music industry</i>

58:37.818 --> 58:42.519
is most artists have this
optimistic view of things.

58:42.606 --> 58:44.651
They go into the studio.
They write together.

58:44.738 --> 58:45.957
They hang out.

58:46.044 --> 58:47.654
As y'all pass
this, y'all are going

58:47.741 --> 58:48.916
to notice that he
looks like he's about

58:49.003 --> 58:50.744
to spit a serious rhyme.

58:50.831 --> 58:53.660
<i>That because they work
so well with each other</i>

58:53.747 --> 58:56.402
<i>that the contractual nature
of it will just all work out.</i>

58:56.489 --> 58:58.926
<i>They just do and create.</i>

58:59.013 --> 59:02.016
It's a very nice way
to view the world.

59:02.103 --> 59:04.802
Unfortunately...

59:04.889 --> 59:07.674
that's why you need me,

59:07.761 --> 59:09.894
because that's not what
the world is about.

59:09.981 --> 59:12.026
Here, just sit on this chair.
Just sit over here.

59:12.113 --> 59:14.072
Here, let me grab your bag.
- Oh, thanks.

59:14.159 --> 59:17.902
<i>In this specific case, which
is Dres, the organic nature</i>

59:17.989 --> 59:20.644
<i>of the way this came about,
which is him just happening</i>

59:20.731 --> 59:23.342
<i>to be at a show and
happened to be invited</i>

59:23.429 --> 59:26.693
<i>by Ma to her house and
happened to talk to Toney,</i>

59:26.780 --> 59:30.131
who happened to give him material,

59:30.218 --> 59:33.134
<i>his first step wasn't, like,
hey, lawyer.</i>

59:33.221 --> 59:36.137
<i>Go call Ma Dukes' lawyer
and get a contract.</i>

59:36.224 --> 59:38.879
<i>It's just not
the way people think.</i>

59:38.966 --> 59:42.535
All right, so...

59:42.622 --> 59:45.886
I'm not sure if--
do you know I met with--

59:45.973 --> 59:47.584
with Ma Dukes and Toney--

59:47.671 --> 59:49.586
- Okay.
- On Thursday?

59:49.673 --> 59:51.022
Yeah.
How'd that go?

59:51.109 --> 59:53.764
It's my understanding
that Ma Dukes,

59:53.851 --> 59:57.376
through Toney's music
publishing company,

59:57.463 --> 59:58.943
controls the rights
to the music...

59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.422
at this point.

01:00:00.509 --> 01:00:04.339
Their concern, I think,
is, you know, natural

01:00:04.426 --> 01:00:06.124
because there's so
much product out

01:00:06.211 --> 01:00:08.126
in the marketplace
right now, J Dilla product,

01:00:08.213 --> 01:00:09.997
that's unauthorized.
- Right.

01:00:10.084 --> 01:00:12.652
That's one of the
hesitancies of them.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:15.046
If you look on YouTube
or on Instagram

01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:18.005
or even Spotify and Apple,

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.094
you see unauthorized
Dilla tracks.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.922
Definitely.

01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:24.055
Their hesitancy
and uncomfortableness

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:26.884
is you were going off
and doing your thing,

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:29.147
and you were getting
features, and you

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:30.670
were making the tracks work.

01:00:30.757 --> 01:00:33.064
And they didn't have
a real understanding

01:00:33.151 --> 01:00:35.719
of what was going on
with their son's music.

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:37.546
I paid for all
of these sessions

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.983
and told you all
about every single--

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.506
you know, like, every step.

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.421
This is why having
contracts with them

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:44.597
is so important to them

01:00:44.684 --> 01:00:47.426
and, obviously,
so important to you.

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:50.037
One of the other
problems is the estate.

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:51.952
It's a bit messy.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:56.261
In addition to Ma, there are
other parties that are vying

01:00:56.348 --> 01:00:58.045
for control of the music.

01:00:58.132 --> 01:01:01.266
And it's one of the things
we just have to clean up,

01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:03.703
which is, I think, you know,
one of the reasons

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.010
that you should just
take a step back for a moment

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:08.839
so we can, you know, get
some clarity on that.

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:10.188
- All right.
- Don't focus on it.

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:13.452
Don't do any recording.
Don't talk about it.

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:17.630
Go and do Dres, tour, produce.
You know, do your thing.

01:01:17.717 --> 01:01:19.763
I've taken it as far as,
in my heart,

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.679
like, I'm looking
at them as Dilla

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:25.029
and that me and
Dilla are a duo.

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:29.947
What she's affording
me is the platform...

01:01:30.034 --> 01:01:31.992
- Right.
- For the world to see

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:34.255
exactly what
I have to say today.

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:36.170
- No, I--
- And that's all I need.

01:01:36.257 --> 01:01:38.129
That's all I need.

01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:40.000
You know, there's
no paperwork.

01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:42.524
So let us focus on Dilla,

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:45.310
because if we can't
make this deal,

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:48.487
then these tracks will
never see the light of day.

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:52.404
All of our time and your money
is going to go to waste.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:56.495
Let us work on this so we
can get this deal done.

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.844
All right.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.459
<i>I've been the same artist
I've been my entire career,</i>

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:07.375
<i>but the music industry
can definitely make</i>

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:10.030
<i>anyone uneasy.</i>

01:02:10.117 --> 01:02:11.684
<i>Is this right?
Is this correct?</i>

01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:14.252
<i>Is anything going
to fall on me?</i>

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:17.821
<i>And as much as
"The Choice Is Yours" puts me</i>

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:19.866
<i>in a lot of rooms
and things thereof,</i>

01:02:19.953 --> 01:02:22.695
<i>it doesn't afford me what this
project is about to afford me.</i>

01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:27.526
<i>From here off,
I think is taking</i>

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:31.225
<i>some of my eggs out of this
basket and this project.</i>

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:36.622
<i>There's hundreds of
thousands of examples</i>

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:39.146
of records that have been made
that will never,

01:02:39.233 --> 01:02:40.713
ever see the light of day.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.847
<i>It's called shelving.</i>

01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:47.372
<i>You know, the question is,
will this Dres and Dilla album</i>

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:49.548
<i>be one of them?</i>

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:00.080
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

01:03:00.167 --> 01:03:02.082
<i>- Oh, slept well.
- Yeah?</i>

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:02.909
<i>Good.</i>

01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:08.175
I told you I've got to go
to Milwaukee today, right?

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.917
Yep.

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:12.789
Did I tell you
what I was doing?

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.530
I told you I was doing
a day party for Adidas--

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:17.228
the sneaker company?

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:20.231
- Yeah, I know what that is.
- Okay, cool.

01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:22.711
<i>I definitely would like
to think that there's</i>

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.279
<i>something inside of me that--</i>

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:27.586
<i>that shines inside of Sid.</i>

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:29.849
Hey, Sidney. Hi.

01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:31.459
- Say, "Happy Father's Day."

01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:33.331
That's my boy.

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:34.898
Who is that?

01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:36.987
Who is that with them
pearly-white teeth?

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.510
Is that my baby?

01:03:38.597 --> 01:03:41.382
Mwah! Don't be
so happy about it.

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:44.124
<i>Sid has grown up
with me in and out.</i>

01:03:44.211 --> 01:03:46.126
<i>Like, you know, it's kind of
a running joke in the house.</i>

01:03:46.213 --> 01:03:48.520
<i>You know what I'm saying?
Like, I'm always leaving.</i>

01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:51.001
Hi, everybody.

01:03:51.088 --> 01:03:53.046
Now say, "bye."

01:03:53.133 --> 01:03:55.440
<i>He always sees me traveling,
going back and forth...</i>

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:57.877
Say, "hello."
- Hi.

01:03:57.964 --> 01:04:00.445
<i>Writing,
reciting, practicing.</i>

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:02.142
<i>That's dad's 9:00-to-5:00.</i>

01:04:02.229 --> 01:04:05.189
<i>Dad is unorthodox
in the degree that, you know,</i>

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:08.061
<i>he doesn't see me get up
at 7:00 in the morning</i>

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:10.803
<i>and go to the office
and come back, ever.</i>

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.285
<i>But he's always
seen me working.</i>

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.200
<i>Did you finish?
- Yeah.</i>

01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:19.507
There were 154 questions
total on the test,

01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:23.990
and I got through, like, 130.
- That's pretty good.

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:28.038
<i>You know, like I didn't
grow up in a nuclear family.</i>

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.649
Be right back, Sid.

01:04:30.736 --> 01:04:34.522
<i>So me learning how to create</i>

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:37.917
<i>a peaceful home is a process.</i>

01:04:38.004 --> 01:04:39.614
<i>I don't come from it.</i>

01:04:39.701 --> 01:04:43.488
<i>So there's times when I've
had to trial-and-error.</i>

01:04:45.316 --> 01:04:46.883
<i>That's something
that your family</i>

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.146
<i>has to go through with you.</i>

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:52.105
What planet has a ring?
- That's Saturn.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:53.672
Okay, smart boy.

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:56.109
I live Saturn, too.

01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:59.373
You live on Saturn, too?
I live on Earth.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.071
<i>Maybe you take me with you
when you get older</i>

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:04.030
<i>and you go into space?
- Okay.</i>

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:06.424
I just want you to
know, I'm a huge fan.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:13.300
<i>Like all my kids, they're
dreamers, without question.</i>

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:15.781
<i>And that's important.
It's important to dream.</i>

01:05:15.868 --> 01:05:17.391
Love you.
- Bye.

01:05:17.478 --> 01:05:19.219
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:20.655
All right.

01:05:20.742 --> 01:05:21.918
Yeah, call Mom
when you're hungry.

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.485
- Yeah.
- All right?

01:05:24.572 --> 01:05:27.662
<i>You know, like, that's
the shit that ages you--</i>

01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:30.709
<i>when you stop dreaming.</i>

01:05:30.796 --> 01:05:32.711
<i>But when you're young,</i>

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:35.453
<i>you might not see
where reality and dreams meet.</i>

01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:41.241
<i>Yo, how y'all feeling?</i>

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.896
Yo, how y'all feeling?

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.637
Yo, my name is Dres.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:49.075
I go by the name of the
sugar-dick daddy Mista Lawnge.

01:05:49.162 --> 01:05:50.120
<i>As you get older,
that becomes</i>

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.773
<i>a little bit more definitive,</i>

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:54.559
<i>definitely with your career
and relationships.</i>

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:55.864
Once you become an
artist, you have

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.301
a sense of responsibility.

01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:58.389
<i>We have a sense
of responsibility</i>

01:05:58.476 --> 01:05:59.825
<i>to all of these people
right here--</i>

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:00.782
<i>you know, things
that we're doing.</i>

01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.132
<i>They look at us.</i>

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:03.263
But at the same
time, I really have

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:05.178
to stress that
people are people,

01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:07.311
<i>and people make mistakes,
and nobody's perfect.</i>

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:10.053
Like, me and Lawnge--
anything can happen.

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.577
What's the name of this
group on the stage tonight?

01:06:12.664 --> 01:06:13.534
all:
Black Sheep!

Man, what y'all been
doing for two years, man?

01:06:24.502 --> 01:06:27.461
Y'all been on hiatus, man.
- Back up off us, man.

01:06:28.897 --> 01:06:30.203
well, you want
to go ahead and elaborate?

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:31.770
Nah, man.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:33.119
- Say no more.
- We'll be back--

01:06:33.206 --> 01:06:35.208
We got Black Sheep

<i>I missed me and
Lawnge being Black Sheep</i>

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.995
and having the
knowledge of each other,

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.735
as well of ourselves.

01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:41.867
<i>We had vision.</i>

01:06:41.954 --> 01:06:43.608
<i>We had concept.</i>

01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:47.046

before we ever hit wax.

What's the black sheep? ♪

Peace, brother.
Pardon me.

01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:00.886
- Black Sheep, right?
- No doubt.

01:07:00.973 --> 01:07:03.497
<i>But at this point, people have
literally seen me on my own</i>

asked me, like,</i>

performing "Choice Is Yours"?</i>

<i>Coming on, doing, like,
one song and everything,</i>

01:07:27.086 --> 01:07:29.306

me in for that.</i>

01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:32.439
<i>But that's beyond a blessing.</i>

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:34.789

<i>Milwaukee is
about that action.</i>

01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:45.061
Remember when we was--
where was we at?

01:07:45.148 --> 01:07:47.280
It was Sweden or something.

01:07:47.367 --> 01:07:48.934
It was nice when we went in
the club, and we came out--

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.588
- We came out, it was snowing.
- It was snowing.

01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.155
It was like we was
in Maine or something.

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:53.547
<i>Yo, shit was crazy.</i>

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:06.299
<i>Hello?</i>

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:08.084
<i>- Mr. Dawson.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:09.476
<i>Hey, how's it going?
This is Dres from Black Sheep.</i>

01:08:09.563 --> 01:08:11.652
<i>I was just trying
to find out what</i>

01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:15.917

to grab us from the hotel.</i>

01:08:17.919 --> 01:08:19.791
<i>You perform at 6:00, right?</i>

01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:21.619
<i>5:20.</i>

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:22.794
<i>Let's say 4:30.</i>

01:08:22.881 --> 01:08:24.143
<i>- 4:30?
- Yeah.</i>

01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:25.623
<i>- Okay.
- All right.</i>

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:26.580
<i>See you then, bro.
- All right.</i>

01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:29.757
Okay, cool.

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.698
I'm not with the bullshit.

01:08:57.785 --> 01:09:01.702

why didn't I hear from--

Like--

01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:09.580
Yeah.
Yeah, like...

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:11.277
Yeah.

01:09:11.364 --> 01:09:12.844
That doesn't even make sense.

01:09:12.931 --> 01:09:15.063
Like, why are we doing it--
you know what I'm saying--

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.761
if we're not, you know--

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:17.979
Yeah.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:21.548
Well, let me just...

01:09:26.727 --> 01:09:28.990
<i>And that shit is a bluff. Fuck.</i>

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:32.168

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:34.953
Toney not signing off
on this shit.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.304
As much as he's
talking about it...

01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:41.394
<i>I can't imagine it not coming
out and it being his fault.</i>

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:43.744
<i>She said out of her mouth,
this is signed off.</i>

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.920
Yeah, like they--

01:09:46.007 --> 01:09:47.095
Fucking studio fees.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:49.228
Let me just do what I'm doing.

01:09:49.315 --> 01:09:52.492
Because if they keep
that shit up, man--

01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:54.451

back and do what I do.

01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:05.853

the proper measures</i>

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:19.432

certainly understand</i>

I don't know if that's
going to happen.

01:14:27.288 --> 01:14:29.813
They were separated
so long ago.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.815
And since I've
made it to New York

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.686
and have been around
the scene,

01:14:33.773 --> 01:14:35.993
I've gotten to know Dres over
the years, always seen him.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.474
I don't recall of any
interaction with Mista Lawnge.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.519
So I have no idea.
Where is he?

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:43.043
I don't know that they're
beefing or whatever.

01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:44.697
Is he going to be in the film?

01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:51.530
Fat chance.
Fat chance.

01:14:51.617 --> 01:14:53.489
I'm saying, a
good documentary

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:55.360
got to get to the bottom
of what the fuck happened.

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:58.363
Well, first of all,
where the fuck is he?

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:02.889
I have no idea--
no clue, none at all.

01:15:02.976 --> 01:15:05.544
Like, yo, the nigga just
disappeared off the Earth.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:09.069
Like, I heard he's in Florida.

01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.984
I don't know how valid that is.

01:15:11.071 --> 01:15:13.160
Last time I heard, I think
he's in North Carolina maybe.

01:15:13.247 --> 01:15:15.206
I don't know.

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:16.294
That's interesting.

01:15:16.381 --> 01:15:17.513
No, where is he?

01:15:29.394 --> 01:15:32.092
<i>In history,</i>

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:35.182
<i>it's always,
what happened to that guy?</i>

01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:37.968
<i>You see this guy. What
happened to the other guy?</i>

01:15:38.055 --> 01:15:39.796
<i>We know it's two.</i>

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:42.581
<i>You dig a little harder,
and you dig a little harder,</i>

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.801

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:48.152
<i>But sometimes when
you find that answer,</i>

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:52.112
<i>it does nothing because
it may be by design.</i>

01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:54.288
It may be a plan.
Who knows?

01:15:57.683 --> 01:16:01.339
<i>Deep down, I'll always be
Mista Lawnge from Black Sheep.</i>

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:06.300
But today I'm just dad.

01:16:06.387 --> 01:16:08.259
No, you stop.
You stop bugging.

01:16:08.346 --> 01:16:10.261
No, I'm sorry.

01:16:10.348 --> 01:16:14.047
A lot of stuff is a blur to
me because it happened fast.

01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:16.049
They just wanted to hear
what we're capable of.

01:16:16.136 --> 01:16:18.617
And then they gave us
a demo budget to do

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:22.316
a real demo, you know,
in a real studio.

01:16:22.403 --> 01:16:25.711
I love hip-hop, and
I love the music.

01:16:25.798 --> 01:16:28.801
<i>But I don't love
what it comes with.</i>

01:16:28.888 --> 01:16:30.150
<i>I mean, you
guys are so young.</i>

01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:32.631
<i>It doesn't matter
what your age is.</i>

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:34.938
You're letting people know us.

01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:37.636
<i>I'm 19 years old
at the time,</i>

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.943
<i>fresh out of high school.</i>

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:41.597
Here, go get on that stage.

01:16:41.684 --> 01:16:43.555
<i>Here, you're
in front of stars.</i>

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.383
<i>You're shaking hands
with A-listers.</i>

01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:49.605
<i>You're, you know, teens
making these big, mega hits.</i>

01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:53.043
<i>When you have that success,</i>

01:16:53.130 --> 01:16:55.132
you have to maintain
that success.

01:16:55.219 --> 01:16:56.524
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.917

01:16:58.004 --> 01:16:59.353
<i>And that's what

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.441
<i>That's what they want to see.</i>

01:17:00.528 --> 01:17:02.879
And it was overwhelming.

01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:08.449
That's what I hate
about the music industry

01:17:08.536 --> 01:17:10.321
and success--

01:17:10.408 --> 01:17:12.279
<i>people's anticipation.</i>

01:17:12.366 --> 01:17:15.587
<i>You get kind of a anxiety.</i>

01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:17.981
I'm not doing it
for the love, anymore.

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.592
I'm doing it for
their expectation.

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.159
How many people who grew up
in hip-hop?

01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:23.943
Make some noise
if you grew up in hip-hop.

01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:28.252
Hip-hop cannibalizes
itself so much

01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:30.733
that they're always
looking for the next new.

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.865
Look at this.
Forget that.

01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:34.562
<i>That's old.</i>

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.130
<i>Hip-hop is the only genre
that that happens in.</i>

01:17:37.217 --> 01:17:41.787
That took away the love
for what I was doing.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:43.310
<i>So I just left.</i>

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.445

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.189
You got something
written, though?

01:24:24.276 --> 01:24:25.625
Shit.
I could play with that one.

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:32.458
This is Dilla, you know,
from the DnD project.

01:24:32.545 --> 01:24:34.895
You want to jump in?
You want me to set it?

01:24:34.982 --> 01:24:36.636
It don't matter to me.

01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:38.290
Yeah, I'll jump in,
while shit is in my head.

01:24:38.377 --> 01:24:39.639
All right.

01:24:42.816 --> 01:24:44.557
<i>While I was on the plane,
I was in my own head</i>

01:24:44.644 --> 01:24:47.125
<i>about what we were
going to be doing.</i>

01:24:47.212 --> 01:24:51.521
<i>I really had no expectations.</i>

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.005
<i>Concepts start flying
from what I see,</i>

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.007
<i>you know, regular life.</i>

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:03.185
<i>The way things happen...</i>

01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:05.491
<i>people.</i>

01:25:05.578 --> 01:25:07.537
<i>And I'll automatically
go into writing.</i>

01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:10.279
Mista Lawnge verse--we
haven't heard in a minute.

01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:11.976
That's what's up.

01:25:12.063 --> 01:25:14.109
<i>Mista Lawnge
from Black Sheep...</i>

01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:15.762
I'm gonna just run through
it a couple of times

01:25:15.849 --> 01:25:17.764
until I learn this shit.

01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:19.288
Y'all need the beat?

01:25:19.375 --> 01:25:21.551
Nah, this for the DnD.
This is a Dilla shit.

01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:23.292
Oh, oh, Dilla drop.
Oh, okay. That's right.

01:25:23.379 --> 01:25:25.076
Get him on this
project, you know?

01:25:25.163 --> 01:25:26.686
<i>- Yeah, yeah.
- That'd be crazy.</i>

01:25:26.773 --> 01:25:28.340
Let's do it again.

01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:31.213
We got the energy.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.606
<i>I mean, with the wild
success of Black Sheep,</i>

01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:35.217
<i>I still look back.</i>

01:25:35.304 --> 01:25:37.523
That wasn't the best part.

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.656
<i>The best part was
that growing--</i>

01:25:39.743 --> 01:25:43.399
<i>you know, just brothers
making music,</i>

01:25:43.486 --> 01:25:45.227
<i>doing what we love.</i>

01:25:45.314 --> 01:25:48.969
We navigated, and we
found our way to here, man.

01:25:49.056 --> 01:25:51.407
I'm proud of us for that.

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:54.061
<i>We learned
from our mistakes.</i>

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:56.716
Continuation.
- You know what I'm saying?

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:59.719
What it could've been,
what it should've been.

01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:02.809
<i>Everything happens
for a reason.</i>

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:04.463
Let's do it.

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:07.684
So let's do some
shit together.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time,</i>

01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:33.971
<i>we're approaching our
next station stop.</i>

01:26:36.278 --> 01:26:38.410
<i>Hey, Dres.
Ma Dukes here.</i>

01:26:38.497 --> 01:26:39.933
<i>What up, doe?</i>

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.935
<i>I thought I need to call you.</i>

01:26:42.022 --> 01:26:46.375
<i>After all the rhetoric and
misconceptions about things,</i>

01:26:46.462 --> 01:26:48.594
<i>I really think we
should get together</i>

01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:50.944
<i>and, you know
like, have a chat,</i>

01:26:51.031 --> 01:26:53.904
<i>kind of explain to each other
what the heck's going on,</i>

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:57.037
<i>you know, sit down--
you, me, and Toney,</i>

01:26:57.124 --> 01:26:59.388
<i>if that's okay with you.</i>

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:00.476
<i>I don't know what
your schedule is,</i>

01:27:00.563 --> 01:27:04.958
<i>but we'll be
in D.C. Wednesday.</i>

01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:07.744
<i>So try to hit me back.</i>

01:27:07.831 --> 01:27:11.443
<i>If I have to extend it a day,
I will, but let me know, okay?</i>

01:27:11.530 --> 01:27:14.925
<i>Reach me back at 313 number
or either of the 323s.</i>

01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:16.405
<i>Both of them I'll have on.</i>

01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:17.797
<i>One love.</i>

01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:21.758
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time,</i>

01:27:21.845 --> 01:27:23.977
<i>we are approaching
our final destination,</i>

01:27:24.064 --> 01:27:26.284
<i>Washington, D.C., station.</i>

01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:27.981
<i>At this time, we ask you...</i>

01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:30.506
<i>I haven't seen Ma since
we were in Puerto Rico.</i>

01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:32.595
<i>As far as this project
itself, you know,</i>

01:27:32.682 --> 01:27:35.293
<i>I've had to deal
with a lot of doubt.</i>

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.601
<i>Washington, DC,
final station.</i>

01:27:38.688 --> 01:27:40.342
<i>We're going through
a cloudy situation.</i>

01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:41.691
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:27:41.778 --> 01:27:43.867
And it's not for me to
move on and just think

01:27:43.954 --> 01:27:45.521
that it's going to be okay.

01:27:45.608 --> 01:27:47.392
That's not how
it's going to work.

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:50.613
<i>So whatever is in question,</i>

01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:53.529
<i>I'd like to address now
face-to-face</i>

01:27:53.616 --> 01:27:56.488
<i>so that there isn't
any misunderstandings.</i>

01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:00.840
What up?

01:28:03.147 --> 01:28:04.496
How are you?

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:05.497
- Good to see you, man.
- No doubt.

01:28:05.584 --> 01:28:07.020
No doubt.
- Good to see you, too.

01:28:07.107 --> 01:28:08.413
No doubt, no doubt.
Hey, Ma.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.327
- What up, doe?
- Ah, here you go.

01:28:09.414 --> 01:28:11.111
This is for you.
- Oh, my God.

01:28:11.198 --> 01:28:12.156
Thank you.
- And it's good to see you.

01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:13.679
Good to see you, too.

01:28:13.766 --> 01:28:16.334
Get all that baggage
off your back and enjoy.

01:28:16.421 --> 01:28:17.596
It's so good to see you.
That's what's up.

01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:19.424
Thank you.
You know I like gifts.

01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:20.730
- It's been too long.
- Yes.

01:28:20.817 --> 01:28:22.253
- Have a seat right here?
- All right.

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.646
What's up now?
How y'all doing?

01:28:23.733 --> 01:28:25.735
Pretty good.
It's been a good day.

01:28:25.822 --> 01:28:27.127
Weather is not bad.
- Yeah, right?

01:28:27.214 --> 01:28:28.564
Right?
- Yeah.

01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:30.479
It turned out pretty
decent out there.

01:28:30.566 --> 01:28:32.481
It was a little overcast
when I left New York,

01:28:32.568 --> 01:28:33.612
but it's nice out here.
- Oh, yes.

01:28:33.699 --> 01:28:35.048
Yeah, it's been
quite the walk.

01:28:35.135 --> 01:28:37.050
It's been quite the walk.

01:28:37.137 --> 01:28:38.748
Yeah.
Yeah, we're here, though.

01:28:38.835 --> 01:28:40.793
- Yes.
- Yeah, you know?

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:44.710
I really wanted to say
that, you know, like, this...

01:28:44.797 --> 01:28:47.670
Like, I just really
trusted who we were.

01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:49.541
Like, you know,
like, what happened?

01:28:49.628 --> 01:28:51.021
Like, what--

01:28:51.108 --> 01:28:53.719
There are numerous
people doing Dilla music--

01:28:53.806 --> 01:28:58.550
not permitted, just
willy-nilly doing whatever.

01:28:58.637 --> 01:29:00.683
It's a known fact that
he's one of the most

01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:03.294
bootlegged artists ever.

01:29:03.381 --> 01:29:06.079
And...

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:11.128
as far as music,
for this project...

01:29:11.215 --> 01:29:13.957
I'm saying it from me to the
ears of those that will listen

01:29:14.044 --> 01:29:16.046
with my own face and mouth.

01:29:16.133 --> 01:29:18.004
This was something that I've
been very excited about.

01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:20.006
Thank you.

01:29:20.093 --> 01:29:23.183
This article has brought
a lot of attention

01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:25.229
to a lot of people.

01:29:25.316 --> 01:29:27.362
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:27.449 --> 01:29:29.059
- And I know what I'm hearing.
- Yeah.

01:29:29.146 --> 01:29:30.190
These are
two different things.

01:29:30.277 --> 01:29:31.757
Like, what happened?

01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:34.325
This doesn't even sound
remotely like--

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:36.283
you know what I'm saying--
like us.

01:29:36.371 --> 01:29:39.156
That was a messy interview.

01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:40.592
That wasn't my quote.

01:29:40.679 --> 01:29:42.377
I was confused.
- Like, it's almost--

01:29:42.464 --> 01:29:44.291
- So I just don't know.
- Yeah, like, why--

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.511
why even write this interview?

01:29:46.598 --> 01:29:49.732
You just was unsure if you
wanted to have this happen?

01:29:49.819 --> 01:29:51.386
No.

01:29:51.473 --> 01:29:52.909
Toney, did you--when
you came to kitchen,

01:29:52.996 --> 01:29:54.911
you said, did you see this?

01:29:54.998 --> 01:29:58.001
I couldn't believe
that "Rolling Stone" article,

01:29:58.088 --> 01:30:02.484
using those particular words,
misquoting my wife.

01:30:02.571 --> 01:30:04.834
It's like, oh, my God, yo.

01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:06.401
How?
- I don't know.

01:30:06.488 --> 01:30:07.663
How?

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:10.187
That's when I knew
for a fact that--

01:30:10.274 --> 01:30:12.494
- Something was very wrong.
- Something was very wrong.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:14.147
Even some of the wording
in it was kind of, like--

01:30:14.234 --> 01:30:15.845
It was, like, crazy.

01:30:15.932 --> 01:30:17.063
Oh, right, right,
right, right.

01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:19.805
And it didn't make sense,
and it was too much

01:30:19.892 --> 01:30:22.373
that I didn't know about
that was being said.

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:25.289
I endorsed this project
in the beginning.

01:30:25.376 --> 01:30:27.334
I've been so excited about it.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:31.687
And the sheer fact that the
idea happened in my own home

01:30:31.774 --> 01:30:34.603
in Puerto Rico, okay,
three years ago,

01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:36.169
so they don't have
to worry about--

01:30:36.256 --> 01:30:37.780
Nobody has to put
an article up.

01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:40.478
Yo, we here.
This is what's important.

01:30:40.565 --> 01:30:41.871
You know,
we withstood the storm.

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:43.133
Right.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.656
And we didn't know
it was coming.

01:30:44.743 --> 01:30:46.223
- Right, right. Real talk.
- We go, oh, you know.

01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:47.442
- On so many fronts.
- And that's life.

01:30:47.529 --> 01:30:49.139
Yeah.

01:30:49.226 --> 01:30:51.228
That's the real thing, and
that's what makes us strong.

01:30:51.315 --> 01:30:52.795
And you want to
know, like, you know,

01:30:52.882 --> 01:30:54.361
that your relationships
can survive that.

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:56.189
And that's what it is.

01:30:56.276 --> 01:30:57.887
Let's rise together.
- Yeah, no doubt.

01:30:57.974 --> 01:31:01.107
- That's what it is.
- Thank you, sincerely.

01:31:01.194 --> 01:31:03.109
You still and always did have
my blessing.

01:31:03.196 --> 01:31:05.155
Thank you.

01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:06.983
That was real.

01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:08.201
It is real.

01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:13.380
<i>Anytime I can get
a chance to see Ma,</i>

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:16.949
<i>it's, like, this just really
parental type of feeling</i>

01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:18.995
<i>that I get in her presence.</i>

01:31:19.082 --> 01:31:22.389
<i>I think about the very humble
beginnings of us</i>

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:26.132
<i>just meeting by chance</i>

01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:28.221
<i>and all that it's become,</i>

01:31:28.308 --> 01:31:30.572
<i>you know, from the pandemic,</i>

01:31:30.659 --> 01:31:33.270
<i>to the trials and tribulations
of creation,</i>

01:31:33.357 --> 01:31:37.361
<i>to, you know, real life
taking place in the interim.</i>

01:31:37.448 --> 01:31:40.277
<i>It's been a learning
experience within itself.</i>

01:31:40.364 --> 01:31:43.323
<i>More than anything, I think
it's invigorated in me</i>

01:31:43.410 --> 01:31:44.716
<i>to definitely make sure that</i>

01:31:44.803 --> 01:31:47.893
<i>my estate and my affairs
are situated.</i>

01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:51.027
<i>Publishing and the music
that I have done</i>

01:31:51.114 --> 01:31:52.507
<i>are going to my children</i>

01:31:52.594 --> 01:31:56.423
<i>to help them
move forward in life.</i>

01:31:56.511 --> 01:32:00.297
<i>It also put the desire in me
to leave something, you know,</i>

01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:02.604
<i>so I'm very grateful for that.</i>

01:32:06.172 --> 01:32:09.828
What the world is seeing
you do for your son

01:32:09.915 --> 01:32:12.048
says it all,
as far as who you are

01:32:12.135 --> 01:32:14.093
and the mother that you are
to this world.

01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:15.921
- Wow. Thank you for that.
- Like, for real, for real.

01:32:16.008 --> 01:32:17.749
Dilla was my whole world.

01:32:17.836 --> 01:32:21.100
Some parents don't even know
that their children were

01:32:21.187 --> 01:32:23.450
talented or creative.
- Right.

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:24.713
But you got to nourish
that talent

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.802
to make the world better
for young people.

01:32:26.889 --> 01:32:27.759
Especially
VH1 Save The Music.

01:32:27.846 --> 01:32:29.021
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

01:32:29.108 --> 01:32:30.066
Oh, that's what's up.

01:32:30.153 --> 01:32:32.155
Yeah, that's--that's my baby.

01:32:32.242 --> 01:32:33.591
I mean, that's why--
how many schools we are now?

01:32:33.678 --> 01:32:36.289
Oh, my God.
We have 40 schools in.

01:32:36.376 --> 01:32:37.682
That's what's up.

01:32:37.769 --> 01:32:39.554
And just for
your own benefit,

01:32:39.641 --> 01:32:43.819
visit any one of
the J Dilla Tech Grant schools

01:32:43.906 --> 01:32:47.387
to see that
growth is happening,

01:32:47.474 --> 01:32:48.954
<i>and children have
more resources.</i>

01:32:49.041 --> 01:32:53.045
And it keeps introducing
who he is to them.

01:32:53.132 --> 01:32:55.047
<i>- Yes, it does.
- You know what I'm saying?</i>

01:32:55.134 --> 01:32:56.745
<i>Like, they're gonna grow up
knowing, like you know,</i>

01:32:56.832 --> 01:32:58.790
<i>Dilla, that means something.</i>

01:32:58.877 --> 01:33:01.793
<i>That name means something.
That name helped me.</i>

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.055
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:33:03.142 --> 01:33:04.709
Hello.

01:33:04.796 --> 01:33:07.016
- Can you hold on?
- Sure.

01:33:07.103 --> 01:33:10.019
- Hey, yo, yo, yo, guys, guys.

01:33:10.106 --> 01:33:12.499
<i>Turn off the speaker and
let's get something recording.</i>

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.197
Let's not vibe right now, okay?

01:33:14.284 --> 01:33:17.330
So Za's gonna record,
bring up a--bring up a thing.

01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:20.159
<i>Save The Music's mission
is helping students,</i>

01:33:20.246 --> 01:33:22.509
<i>schools, and communities
reach their full potential</i>

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.381
<i>through making music.</i>

01:33:24.468 --> 01:33:27.253
One of the things I saw in
my first years here was

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:31.693
there was incredible demand
from the student side

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:36.001
for hip hop, electronic music,
beat-making--

01:33:36.088 --> 01:33:37.524
<i>you know, the music that
the students are</i>

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:38.961
<i>actually listening to.</i>

01:33:39.048 --> 01:33:40.353
Yeah!

01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:43.182
You want to record that in?

01:33:43.269 --> 01:33:44.575
<i>We've got to name it
something other than</i>

01:33:44.662 --> 01:33:45.663
<i>the Music Tech Grant.</i>

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:47.709
We put our heads together.

01:33:47.796 --> 01:33:50.929
There's really only one person
who could possibly be

01:33:51.016 --> 01:33:55.238
<i>the patron saint for this
program, and that's J Dilla.</i>

01:33:55.325 --> 01:33:57.109
Does anybody else wanna take
a stab at a different beat?

01:33:57.196 --> 01:33:58.371
Yes.

01:33:58.458 --> 01:34:00.243
The Dilla Tech Program,

01:34:00.330 --> 01:34:02.549
we see it's incredibly popular
with music students,

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.856
<i>and then it also pulls in</i>

01:34:04.943 --> 01:34:07.250
<i>a whole other
population of students</i>

01:34:07.337 --> 01:34:11.950
<i>who never considered music
through the traditional paths.</i>

01:34:12.037 --> 01:34:13.909
<i>I'm always amazed</i>

01:34:13.996 --> 01:34:15.998
<i>when you take
young people seriously</i>

01:34:16.085 --> 01:34:18.957
and their creativity seriously
what they come back with.

01:34:19.044 --> 01:34:21.003
So, let's meet everybody.
Y'all got to introduce me.

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:23.092
Absolutely.
This is Elijah right there,

01:34:23.179 --> 01:34:25.007
definitely one of our
producers-in-making over here.

01:34:25.094 --> 01:34:27.183
- How are you?
- Good, man. How you feeling?

01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:28.575
These are some of the guys
over here.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:29.968
They're working right now.

01:34:30.055 --> 01:34:31.709
Who's in the booth?

01:34:31.796 --> 01:34:33.276
- Can you engineer?
- No, he engineer my music.

01:34:33.363 --> 01:34:36.279
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
And all of y'all are artists?

01:34:36.366 --> 01:34:37.889
All of y'all are engineers?
All of y'all producers?

01:34:37.976 --> 01:34:38.847
- No, I'm an artist.
- I'm an artist.

01:34:38.934 --> 01:34:40.370
- Artist, artist.
- I'm a ballplayer, too.

01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:41.893
- Ballplayer, too?
- Yeah, he an artist, though.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.765
All right.
What's your name, champ?

01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:45.201
- Name's Kenny.
- Kenny?

01:34:45.288 --> 01:34:46.637
- I'ma come up.
- Kenny, you wanna come up?

01:34:46.724 --> 01:34:48.204
- Watch this.
- I like it.

01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:50.249
Give it a couple years, man.
Not even a couple years.

01:34:50.336 --> 01:34:51.860
Just give it a couple months.
I'ma blow up.

01:34:51.947 --> 01:34:53.296
I promise y'all that.
You heard?

01:34:53.383 --> 01:34:54.776
You know what?
I like the attitude.

01:34:54.863 --> 01:34:56.168
That's the attitude
you supposed to have.

01:34:56.255 --> 01:34:58.083
You know what I'm saying?
That's what's up.

01:34:58.170 --> 01:35:00.129
So I'm saying--
so can we hear something?

01:35:00.216 --> 01:35:01.565
Which one you want?

01:35:01.652 --> 01:35:04.742
I want the one that
you think is the dopest.

01:35:04.829 --> 01:35:06.483
Like, when you play something
for somebody,

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:08.006
you give them your best shot.

01:35:08.093 --> 01:35:09.878
You don't give them
something you working on.

01:35:47.002 --> 01:35:50.005
And I just put it in the song,

01:35:50.092 --> 01:35:51.484
I feel like--
I don't know, man.

01:35:51.571 --> 01:35:54.444

01:35:59.884 --> 01:36:01.712
How do I get out of
this position?

01:36:01.799 --> 01:36:06.151
I feel hopeless, right?

01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:09.764
But you're saying,
"I was hopeless."

01:36:09.851 --> 01:36:11.026
You're not saying
"I am hopeless."

01:36:11.113 --> 01:36:12.462
I'm just telling you
what I'm hearing

01:36:12.549 --> 01:36:14.812

I'm like, wow, this is strong.

01:36:14.899 --> 01:36:16.335
This is powerful.
That's a powerful piece.

01:36:16.422 --> 01:36:18.860
That's a dope--that's a dope
rhyme, a dope hook.

01:36:18.947 --> 01:36:19.948

why is this the best song?

01:37:42.117 --> 01:37:44.206
She put so much emotion

01:37:44.293 --> 01:37:45.468
she not worried about

- Yeah.

01:37:47.122 --> 01:37:48.819
She got the most originality
I've ever heard.

01:37:48.906 --> 01:37:50.125
The track that she chose

01:37:50.212 --> 01:37:52.170
differentiated her from
everyone here.

01:37:52.257 --> 01:37:55.130
She was comfortable in
her authenticity.

01:37:55.217 --> 01:37:57.045
She was comfortable in
who she was.

01:37:57.132 --> 01:37:58.829

Whoo, that's hard.
That's hard.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.186

Yo, you nailed that.

01:38:08.273 --> 01:38:09.535
You nailed that.

01:38:09.622 --> 01:38:10.580

Yeah? You said that

<i>A lot of times, artists

01:38:36.954 --> 01:38:39.739

<i>Sometimes just giving

<i>It's important that we start

01:40:00.516 --> 01:40:02.997
How did she pick this sample?

01:40:03.084 --> 01:40:04.607

All right, guys, last look.
That's it. Last looks.

01:40:27.412 --> 01:40:28.370

"girl, that right there,

we was outside."

01:40:43.689 --> 01:40:46.214

- Roll camera.

01:40:46.301 --> 01:40:47.258

and the kid going to be like,
"you hear that? No, no, no."

01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:55.191
Or the parents play theirs,

01:46:55.278 --> 01:46:56.845
and they be like,
"oh, that's Lola Brooke."

01:46:56.932 --> 01:46:58.673
