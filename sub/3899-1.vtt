01:16.358 --> 01:19.193
[in sultry voice] I'd butter your toast.

01:21.405 --> 01:23.448
I'd feed her dog.

01:25.374 --> 01:27.411
I'd zip his sweater.

01:27.494 --> 01:28.662
Mmm.

01:28.745 --> 01:29.746
[in normal voice] See?

01:29.829 --> 01:32.457
It doesn't matter what
you say, as long as it's...

01:32.541 --> 01:34.709
[in sultry voice]
"I'd blank your blank."

01:34.793 --> 01:35.794
[chuckles]

01:35.877 --> 01:38.588
[in normal voice] It
all sounds dirty, always.

01:38.672 --> 01:41.007
[in sultry voice] I'd
disembowel his cat.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.426
That is not sexy.

01:42.509 --> 01:44.386
No, she did not say that right.

01:44.469 --> 01:46.888
I'd scratch that eczema.

01:46.971 --> 01:49.683
Oh, she is killing your
theory, here, Doggett.

01:49.766 --> 01:52.477
Well, her exception
proves the rules, 'cause...

01:52.561 --> 01:55.355
you guys gotta know,
my boyfriend, Arlen...

01:55.439 --> 01:56.690
[exhales]

01:56.773 --> 01:58.817
He was the master of it. [moans]

01:58.900 --> 02:02.654
He'd bed you whispering, [in sultry
voice] "I'd light your crack pipe"?

02:03.530 --> 02:06.325
I didn't smoke crack.
Crack's for coloreds.

02:06.408 --> 02:07.617
- [in normal voice] Oh, is it, now?
- N...

02:08.910 --> 02:11.705
African Americans. Crack
is for African Americans.

02:11.788 --> 02:13.290
Maybe you should just drive.

02:13.373 --> 02:14.833
I am drivin'.

02:14.916 --> 02:17.043
I gotta say, these cup holders are nice.

02:17.126 --> 02:21.130
The air works. Seats don't
smell like hot dog juice.

02:21.214 --> 02:23.467
Maybe we should get all
of our terminal inmates

02:23.550 --> 02:25.385
to drive our outdated
crap into a quarry.

02:25.469 --> 02:27.679
Gotta give it to the baldy, though.

02:27.762 --> 02:30.139
She had some set of balls.

02:30.223 --> 02:32.309
You know, a man went bald...

02:32.392 --> 02:33.643
and he bawled.

02:33.727 --> 02:35.354
[mimics sobbing]

02:35.437 --> 02:37.481
But then he met a
really nice lady who...

02:37.564 --> 02:38.940
She liked a clean head, right?

02:39.023 --> 02:41.401
So he balled her real good.

02:41.485 --> 02:44.278
So you got "bald," "bawled,"
and "balled," right?

02:44.363 --> 02:48.032
They all sound alike, but
they're all spelled different.

02:48.116 --> 02:49.158
[chuckles] Isn't that wild?

02:49.242 --> 02:50.660
My mom taught me that.

02:50.744 --> 02:52.954
She taught me so many cool things.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.585
Come on, hon. Get it all down.

03:00.211 --> 03:01.921
That's right.

03:02.005 --> 03:03.590
Chug, chug, chug.

03:05.299 --> 03:06.967
Hey! All of it!

03:09.345 --> 03:10.805
Finish that bottle.

03:10.889 --> 03:12.391
[young Pennsatucky grunting]

03:12.474 --> 03:15.143
[Debbie] See for yourself
she ain't right in the head.

03:15.226 --> 03:18.897
Never had all what
belongs to her, poor thing.

03:19.939 --> 03:21.650
But we take what the Lord gives us.

03:22.651 --> 03:25.612
Anyhow, so's I understand it,

03:25.695 --> 03:28.615
supplemental security income benefits
for little Bessie bugs like mine

03:28.698 --> 03:31.367
is $314 a month.

03:32.452 --> 03:34.078
Is that right?

03:34.162 --> 03:35.580
[Maxwell] How many kids
are coming for Mother's Day?

03:35.664 --> 03:39.793
A lot. Some of our ladies,
they have three, four, seven.

03:39.876 --> 03:41.169
[exhales]

03:41.252 --> 03:42.587
I would have had five.

03:43.588 --> 03:45.006
Or six...

03:45.089 --> 03:48.385
if you count the one that fell
out after the night in the caves.

03:48.468 --> 03:49.469
Huh.

03:49.553 --> 03:52.722
Would have been a miracle
baby, like Tim Tebow.

03:52.806 --> 03:54.766
Based on the state of your
mouth when you came in,

03:54.849 --> 03:57.310
I'm gonna say your baby wasn't
on the star athlete track.

03:57.394 --> 04:00.264
Oh, yeah? Well... neither was Tim Tebow.

04:01.314 --> 04:02.774
You know, when his mama was pregnant,

04:02.857 --> 04:03.900
she had the sickness

04:03.983 --> 04:05.777
and the doctors told
her not to have the baby,

04:05.860 --> 04:07.361
but she had it anyhow.

04:07.446 --> 04:10.907
And she was on dysentery
medicine and in Filipino town.

04:10.990 --> 04:12.877
He wasn't such a great quarterback.

04:13.910 --> 04:14.953
Oh.

04:15.036 --> 04:17.581
Like you so great at football. [scoffs]

04:17.664 --> 04:18.998
I may have kids one day.

04:19.082 --> 04:20.709
One day? You got a time machine?

04:20.791 --> 04:22.669
The women in my family
have very young ovaries.

04:22.752 --> 04:24.463
My mother had me at 49.

04:24.546 --> 04:26.756
Her mother had my Uncle Chess, at 52.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.924
I got plenty of time.

04:28.007 --> 04:29.801
We believe what we believe.

04:29.884 --> 04:31.928
You guys, look at this...
look at this sale stuff.

04:32.011 --> 04:34.347
We should just bring back
all this Cinco DE Mayo.

04:34.473 --> 04:35.515
I mean, look.

04:39.644 --> 04:41.563
"Fiesta like there's no mañana."

04:41.646 --> 04:43.147
Seriously.

04:43.231 --> 04:45.567
You know most of the
kids are gonna be Mexican,

04:45.650 --> 04:46.901
so make 'em feel at home.

04:46.985 --> 04:48.945
Just get 'em one of
these red chili piñatas,

04:49.028 --> 04:51.948
a bunch of these... green
candies from St. Patrick's Day,

04:52.031 --> 04:53.366
and we got a party.

04:53.450 --> 04:54.576
Doggett, enough.

04:54.659 --> 04:55.827
The only reason why you're in here

04:55.910 --> 04:58.204
is 'cause we couldn't
leave you in the van.

05:07.506 --> 05:09.591
Let's go price the helium tanks.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.138
[exhaling]

05:17.669 --> 05:18.753
You all right?

05:18.755 --> 05:19.923
I'm fine.

05:20.477 --> 05:21.728
[breathing deeply]

05:22.479 --> 05:23.980
Are you havin' a panic attack?

05:24.564 --> 05:26.525
I'm breathing mindfully.

05:26.608 --> 05:28.568
I'm supposed to do it to 108...

05:28.652 --> 05:32.363
and then do it again if I'm
not feeling any better...

05:32.446 --> 05:34.240
even though I never feel better.

05:35.366 --> 05:37.326
Now I lost count. Shit!

05:37.410 --> 05:38.452
[groans]

05:38.829 --> 05:39.922
Where did you learn this?

05:39.924 --> 05:42.298
Some magazine. I don't know.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.018
I'm just trying to
find some fuckin' peace.

05:46.071 --> 05:48.782
Holy shit, look who's back.

05:48.865 --> 05:49.908
You missed me, right?

05:49.991 --> 05:52.911
- Like a bulldog misses his balls.
- [chuckles]

05:52.994 --> 05:54.495
You're in that bunk.

05:56.664 --> 05:58.499
I can't sleep on the top bunk.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.418
- Yeah, well, not the top.
- [Anita] Oh, no. Uh-uh.

06:00.501 --> 06:02.670
That's Rosa's bed. Back it up.

06:02.754 --> 06:04.505
DeMarco, she's been
assigned to that bunk.

06:04.589 --> 06:06.132
Show some respect for the dead.

06:13.717 --> 06:15.093
[groans]

06:15.143 --> 06:17.771
Red, I know you from the first
night I spent in this room,

06:17.936 --> 06:20.230
but you take one more thing down,
I'm gonna reopen your head wounds.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.898
Wanna build a shrine to Rosa?

06:21.982 --> 06:24.025
Build it somewhere she had joy...

06:24.109 --> 06:28.279
not on this miserable bed
where she lay dying of cancer.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.198
The woman went out like a champ.

06:31.366 --> 06:32.575
Tough fuckin' broad.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.035
You want any of this?

06:34.119 --> 06:36.079
Yeah, the playin' cards.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.373
She was a good card player.

06:41.626 --> 06:42.753
[Sister Ingalls] How you doing, Red?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.629
[Red] Strangest thing...

06:44.712 --> 06:47.848
ever since the assault I
speak with this Russian accent.

06:48.633 --> 06:50.635
- You still having headaches?
- Yeah. [groans]

06:51.762 --> 06:54.055
Trying to wean myself off the pills.

06:54.139 --> 06:56.933
I can't stand feeling
foggy all the time.

06:58.059 --> 06:59.477
You got any on ya?

06:59.560 --> 07:01.604
A few. I've been cheeking them.

07:02.939 --> 07:03.982
Here.

07:04.414 --> 07:05.391
How much you want?

07:05.732 --> 07:06.881
Nothin'.

07:06.883 --> 07:09.279
[chuckles] You don't give
anything away for free.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.031
I've turned over a new leaf.

07:11.546 --> 07:13.491
Wait. That's been in your mouth?

07:14.213 --> 07:15.505
Briefly, yes.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.954
Ugh. Shkeeve. No offense.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.665
I only share spit with
my man and my babies.

07:22.918 --> 07:23.960
I'll take it.

07:31.553 --> 07:34.598
Mother's Day Fair...
expanded visitation...

07:34.888 --> 07:37.557
it fosters the inmates'
connection to the outside world.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.185
These women forget they
have lives on the outside,

07:40.268 --> 07:41.477
it affects how they behave in here.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.814
Maybe they forget for good reason.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.358
Well, that's your job to worry
about now. You're the expert.

07:47.442 --> 07:49.235
Not really. My degree's in cosmetology.

07:49.319 --> 07:50.361
My whole résumé's a lie.

07:50.445 --> 07:52.197
But you would be amazed
what ladies will reveal

07:52.280 --> 07:53.865
while you're bleaching their arm hair.

07:54.783 --> 07:58.036
[stammers] I don't know you
that well. You're joking, right?

07:58.119 --> 08:00.121
'Cause I just got everything
square around here,

08:00.205 --> 08:01.331
and it's been an uphill climb.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.682
So I heard.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.500
Now, what'd you hear?

08:04.584 --> 08:08.338
That you got caught in a shit-storm,
but you put up a sturdy umbrella.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.798
Yeah, well, it's starting to leak.

08:09.881 --> 08:14.052
Now I'm doing Madame Shit-Storm's
job, along with doing my old job,

08:14.135 --> 08:16.596
which the powers-that-be
have yet to fill.

08:16.679 --> 08:17.722
[sighs]

08:17.806 --> 08:19.474
I'm doin' two jobs.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.642
Do you resent that the
administration hired me

08:21.726 --> 08:23.603
before finding a
replacement for your old job?

08:24.770 --> 08:25.856
Are you analyzin' me?

08:25.939 --> 08:26.982
No.

08:27.065 --> 08:29.860
I just don't want any shade
without having been given a shot.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.611
My beef's not with you.

08:31.694 --> 08:33.154
What'd you hear about me?

08:33.238 --> 08:35.866
That you're smart and
you're qualified and...

08:35.948 --> 08:36.991
you said yes.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.410
Does my saying yes maybe
cancel out the smart part?

08:41.328 --> 08:42.311
How's this?

08:42.313 --> 08:45.390
Welcome to Litchfield, where
your services are needed

08:45.392 --> 08:48.938
in both the counseling
and hair removal arenas.

08:49.212 --> 08:51.631
These are complicated ladies
in a complicated place.

08:51.714 --> 08:53.008
[Taystee] Yo!

08:53.091 --> 08:56.136
Mr. Caputo! That your girlfriend?

08:56.219 --> 08:58.889
I had a feeling you had a
thing for the darker berries.

09:00.223 --> 09:02.475
Jefferson, this is Counselor Rogers.

09:02.558 --> 09:04.685
Counselor? What about Mr. Healy?

09:04.769 --> 09:05.770
He's still here.

09:05.854 --> 09:08.231
Huh. This is gonna get interestin'.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.983
Is it? How so?

09:10.066 --> 09:11.817
Jefferson, why don't you go help set up?

09:11.902 --> 09:13.444
Yes, sir, mas'er.

09:15.446 --> 09:16.948
Mr. Caputo, sir.

09:17.032 --> 09:18.033
What do you want, Bennett?

09:18.116 --> 09:19.534
Sir, all the lights in C-Dorm went out,

09:19.617 --> 09:21.786
so I sent some of the girls in
electrical down to take a look at it.

09:21.870 --> 09:23.955
They're not girls,
Bennett. They're inmates.

09:24.571 --> 09:25.540
Or women.

09:25.623 --> 09:26.875
Or electricians.

09:26.958 --> 09:28.084
What's your point?

09:29.294 --> 09:31.880
Um, well, the lights are back on now.

09:31.963 --> 09:34.257
It's a great story.
Thank you for sharing.

09:36.301 --> 09:38.136
- Berdie Rogers, new counselor.
- Hi.

09:38.219 --> 09:39.971
Officer Bennett...

09:40.055 --> 09:42.057
is there anything else
you'd like to tell us?

09:42.140 --> 09:43.683
Nice to meet you.

09:48.479 --> 09:49.814
What's goin' on there?

09:49.898 --> 09:52.358
[sighs] Nothing. It's nothing.

09:52.442 --> 09:55.111
How about we go on a tour of the
dorms in all their well-lit glory?

10:00.450 --> 10:02.452
Everybody says she's got magic.

10:02.535 --> 10:05.538
Did she touch it, too? I
wanna know that she touched it.

10:06.456 --> 10:10.210
Mmm-hmm. She touched it. She blessed it.

10:10.293 --> 10:11.294
- [gasps]
- Oh, shit.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.503
[inmate] What does that mean?

10:13.588 --> 10:15.798
[gasps] Hasan put a
curse on me, didn't he?

10:15.881 --> 10:17.550
That's a cursed egg.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.928
I'll lose a foot.

10:20.011 --> 10:21.554
Bobo will attack all the quail.

10:21.637 --> 10:23.681
It's not a cursed egg.
My hand slipped, okay?

10:23.764 --> 10:26.017
Why don't you go get cleaned up,
and then we'll start all over again?

10:26.101 --> 10:28.686
We're gonna do a whole thing, okay? Go.

10:28.769 --> 10:31.940
[inmate] I'm all eggy now.
It's gonna attract snakes.

10:32.023 --> 10:33.274
I know. That's not good.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.653
Now what does the egg do? You
makin' somebody else go away?

10:36.694 --> 10:38.071
I'm making an omelet.

10:38.154 --> 10:40.115
I got no scraps for your hooch today,

10:40.198 --> 10:43.201
and I am still waiting on
my jar from the last batch.

10:43.284 --> 10:46.204
Okay, it's comin'. A few
more days. It's gonna be good.

10:46.287 --> 10:48.248
Listen, we were thinkin' of doin', like,

10:48.331 --> 10:50.083
a little game booth for the kids,

10:50.166 --> 10:53.919
where they throw Ping-Pong balls into
little bowls of water. Win a prize.

10:54.004 --> 10:55.088
Can I borrow some bowls?

10:55.171 --> 10:57.277
Where you gonna get some
Ping-Pong balls around here?

10:57.279 --> 10:58.560
Found a bunch in the warehouse.

10:58.562 --> 11:01.547
They're old as fuck and mostly
dented, but they'll work.

11:01.864 --> 11:03.679
What are you gonna do for prizes?

11:04.042 --> 11:06.641
Buy some Tootsie Rolls
from commissary...

11:06.724 --> 11:07.850
dole them out.

11:09.019 --> 11:10.061
That's nice of you.

11:10.145 --> 11:12.480
Yeah, well, it's y'all's day.

11:12.563 --> 11:15.358
Must be hard as fuck bein' in here
when you got kids on the outside.

11:15.441 --> 11:16.484
Your kids comin'?

11:16.567 --> 11:19.570
Yeah... for the first
time in a long time.

11:19.654 --> 11:22.448
My tía, she moved back into the city.

11:22.532 --> 11:24.575
Don't forget to call
your mother tomorrow.

11:25.826 --> 11:26.994
Oh, my mom's passed.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.416
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.252
- Mira, Blanca!
- [Blanca] Eh?

11:34.335 --> 11:38.256
Why don't you get this one some of
those fruit cocktail-sized bowls?

11:39.257 --> 11:40.258
I won a goldfish once

11:40.341 --> 11:41.967
[speaking Spanish]
in one of those games.

11:42.927 --> 11:43.969
Tequila, we named him.

11:44.054 --> 11:45.555
[speaking English] We gave
him, like, Froot Loops to eat.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.014
Like 12 years that thing lived...

11:47.098 --> 11:49.392
until my cousin, Antoni,
ate him on a dare.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.810
Fucking asshole.

11:51.852 --> 11:54.021
I'm definitely a carbon monoxide guy.

11:54.897 --> 11:57.358
Put on some tunes,
breathe deep, go out easy.

11:58.484 --> 12:00.528
- Maybe pills.
- Figures.

12:00.611 --> 12:01.987
What do you mean, "figures"?

12:02.072 --> 12:03.864
Pills are expensive.

12:05.032 --> 12:06.033
But you don't even think about that.

12:06.117 --> 12:09.079
Well, I didn't realize that my
hypothetical suicide had a budget.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.871
Some of us have to
think about these things.

12:10.955 --> 12:12.957
I make 11 cents an hour.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.751
When I get outta here,
I will have no home...

12:15.835 --> 12:19.380
I will have no job... and
not a whole lot of prospects.

12:19.464 --> 12:21.549
All the more reason to
start thinking economically.

12:22.387 --> 12:24.094
Welcome to the real world, princess.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.011
This is not a healthy discussion.

12:26.721 --> 12:29.932
You know, when you go to a shooting range,
you don't have to pay until you leave.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.710
So you can check out a gun...

12:32.435 --> 12:34.562
shoot yourself right there.
Wouldn't cost you a cent.

12:35.605 --> 12:37.482
I would like to change
the subject, please.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.694
You know, the... hot one's back.

12:41.777 --> 12:43.654
What do you mean, "the hot one"?

12:43.738 --> 12:44.739
Your girlfriend.

12:46.449 --> 12:48.243
The Bettie Page of Litchfield.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.121
Alex is back?

12:53.620 --> 12:54.705
I gotta go find her.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.609
- Oh, hey! You're on the clock here.
- Well, can I go early?

12:57.818 --> 12:58.711
Sure.

12:58.794 --> 13:01.214
Why don't you grab a happy hour
cocktail with her at TGI Fridays?

13:01.297 --> 13:03.537
- You wanna put in for vacation time, too?
- Okay, okay, all right.

13:03.539 --> 13:05.318
Finish your fucking job.

13:06.136 --> 13:07.887
It's not like she's goin' anywhere.

13:07.970 --> 13:09.680
And to be honest, she
looked a little rough.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.058
It sucks when hot chicks
start to cool down.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.313
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

13:17.397 --> 13:18.523
Okay, okay, listen up.

13:18.606 --> 13:20.983
If you don't have children comin'
today, please come back another time.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.236
And for all you mothers,
it's a numbers day.

13:23.319 --> 13:24.529
No special request.

13:24.612 --> 13:27.457
I only wanna trim so I look the
same as the last time I saw her.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.784
It's called object permanence.

13:29.867 --> 13:32.162
It's also called
boring... but you the boss.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.248
And what are we doin' with you today?

13:35.331 --> 13:37.792
I'll take number seven, please.

13:39.544 --> 13:40.920
You excited for Mother's Day?

13:41.003 --> 13:43.631
Oh, yeah, all my kids are comin'.

13:43.714 --> 13:46.592
Little Donovan and baby Frankie,

13:46.676 --> 13:49.304
that's short for
Francesca, and the twins.

13:49.387 --> 13:50.513
You got four kids?

13:50.596 --> 13:53.766
Oh, sure. Catholic.
You know how it goes.

13:53.849 --> 13:55.643
You don't got no kids.

13:55.726 --> 13:58.938
Yes, I do. I have four kids and
they're all coming to see me.

13:59.021 --> 14:00.731
Bull... shit.

14:00.815 --> 14:03.150
- Show me your stomach.
- What?

14:03.234 --> 14:05.778
Mother of four, twins no less.

14:05.861 --> 14:08.030
Let me see your belly.

14:08.113 --> 14:12.034
Maybe I did a lot of sit-ups,
and maybe they're adopted.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.953
Get the fuck out of my chair.

14:14.036 --> 14:16.664
No, I need this. I lost my van.

14:16.747 --> 14:18.583
I have been scrubbin' toilets.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.293
Let me feel like a person.

14:20.376 --> 14:23.504
You can feel like a person
after I see my actual baby

14:23.588 --> 14:25.381
that came out of me and exists.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.634
Well, maybe my mother's comin' to
visit and I need to look nice for her.

14:28.718 --> 14:30.428
[speaking Spanish] Liar.

14:30.518 --> 14:33.563
I really haven't been
feelin' so good lately,

14:33.639 --> 14:37.310
and dollin' up's the only
way I got to feel better.

14:40.104 --> 14:41.356
- Okay.
- What?

14:41.439 --> 14:43.191
- I'll work on her real fast.
- Come...

14:43.274 --> 14:45.109
I got a soft spot for the pathetics.

14:45.193 --> 14:47.195
[softly] Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

14:48.238 --> 14:50.240
Somebody comin' to
visit you this weekend?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.533
My son, Michael.

14:52.617 --> 14:53.659
Oh.

14:53.743 --> 14:57.663
How does that work, with
you being a lady-man and all?

14:57.747 --> 15:01.459
Do you and his mother
both celebrate the day?

15:01.542 --> 15:03.711
You really wanna be callin' me a lady-man

15:03.794 --> 15:06.297
when I got a fistful
of your hair in my hand?

15:06.381 --> 15:08.508
Oh, I just thought it sounded nice.

15:08.591 --> 15:10.926
I don't know from these things.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.887
That's why I'm askin' questions.

15:14.889 --> 15:16.807
We're sharing the day.

15:16.891 --> 15:20.019
He's spending Father's Day with
her new boyfriend, the pastor.

15:20.102 --> 15:21.103
Oh.

15:21.186 --> 15:24.565
Well, that doesn't seem
fair. He's not his father.

15:24.649 --> 15:26.567
Well, I'm not sure I am anymore, either.

15:37.787 --> 15:39.789
We goin' about this the
wrong way. I should sing.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.999
It'll drive him out of there screaming.

15:42.082 --> 15:43.376
- Mmm.
- [chuckles]

15:43.459 --> 15:44.585
Mmm. Do my feet again.

Ah, yeah. Ooh.

15:55.346 --> 15:57.890
I run around the block a couple
times, do some jumpin' jacks.

15:57.973 --> 15:59.350
Get out.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.769
Do you hear me?

16:01.852 --> 16:05.230
It is time for you to
vacate the premises.

16:05.315 --> 16:06.566
It's your eviction notice.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.455
[sighs] Ooh.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.653
Did you see that?

16:12.186 --> 16:13.228
That was a foot.

16:13.684 --> 16:15.240
A whole person in there.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.828
Mmm. You scared.

16:19.912 --> 16:20.913
A little.

16:22.122 --> 16:23.874
Don't be. You're gonna
make a great daddy.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.627
Ah.

16:26.711 --> 16:28.128
- Back on that foot.
- [chuckles]

16:28.212 --> 16:29.630
Back on that... There you go.

16:29.714 --> 16:30.923
There.

16:32.801 --> 16:35.260
You know, there's nothing
wrong with that light.

16:35.345 --> 16:37.347
[chuckles] Oh, yeah? Why don't
you let me be the judge of that?

16:37.430 --> 16:38.973
Because you don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

16:39.056 --> 16:40.140
Okay, you know what?

16:40.224 --> 16:43.769
For your information, there's actually
a loose fluorescent bulb in here.

16:43.853 --> 16:47.147
You're lucky I caught this,
or we might all be dead.

16:47.231 --> 16:48.232
[scoffs]

16:50.192 --> 16:52.236
You know why she's in
here all the time lately?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.571
'Cause she's a dumbshit.

16:53.654 --> 16:55.615
'Cause she got a crush on me.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.700
What are you talking about?

16:57.783 --> 17:01.078
When she had that bet thing going
on with the bully butch bitch,

17:01.161 --> 17:03.831
she tried to get me, but I didn't do it.

17:03.914 --> 17:05.333
She wasn't offering anything good.

17:05.415 --> 17:08.252
Well, I've seen you suck a
cock for a bag of ranch Doritos.

17:08.336 --> 17:11.881
Totally different. That was a
cock. And I love ranch flavor.

17:12.423 --> 17:14.675
The point is, she's really into me,

17:14.759 --> 17:16.344
which is why she keeps
coming around here.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.303
Well, you gotta stop leading her on.

17:18.387 --> 17:21.223
I ain't done nothin'. I
can't help that I'm dyke bait.

17:23.851 --> 17:26.604
Yeah, look at her, bendin'
down, showin' you her ass.

17:26.686 --> 17:27.855
I think you're right.

17:27.938 --> 17:31.191
I'm telling you... she's
so desperate for me.

17:32.109 --> 17:33.861
Makes me almost sad for her.

17:36.781 --> 17:38.699
[drier timer buzzing]

17:38.783 --> 17:40.242
[oven timer dings]

17:42.667 --> 17:44.121
Oh, Nicky! She coming!

17:44.204 --> 17:46.499
- Stop her! It's not ready!
- What's not ready?

17:46.582 --> 17:48.501
No, Mommy, you have to
go back! Go back to bed!

17:48.584 --> 17:50.503
Sweetie, we're having
brunch at the Four Seasons.

17:50.586 --> 17:52.380
Paloma, why is she not dressed?

17:52.463 --> 17:55.299
[stammers] I tell her, but
she want to surprise you.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.176
She been up since 6:00.

17:57.259 --> 18:00.054
Well, that's very cute, honey,

18:00.137 --> 18:01.556
but we need to get dressed

18:01.639 --> 18:04.266
and put on our happy faces
and pretend we like Grandma.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.969
There'll be shrimp cocktail.

18:07.027 --> 18:08.521
But it's Mother's Day.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.147
That's right. It's my day.

18:10.230 --> 18:14.527
So we will get through brunch, and
I will head straight for the spa.

18:14.610 --> 18:15.736
Happy mother.

18:17.237 --> 18:18.489
Oh, come on, sweetheart.

18:18.573 --> 18:21.534
Put on the blue dress I
bought you from Bergdorf's.

18:30.918 --> 18:33.087
She didn't read my card.

18:37.758 --> 18:40.094
Your hair looks nice like that.

18:40.177 --> 18:41.637
Oh, you noticed.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.847
- [scoffs]
- Oh, honey.

18:42.930 --> 18:46.016
Yeah, well, I'm glad to see
you keepin' yourself up, doll.

18:46.100 --> 18:50.104
No one likes to see a beautiful,
ripe fruit just wither on the vine.

18:50.187 --> 18:51.564
You like my ripe fruit?

18:51.647 --> 18:55.067
[scoffs] So sweet, so juicy.

18:55.150 --> 18:58.529
Oh, as if the smell of this dinner
isn't making me feel nauseous enough.

18:58.613 --> 19:01.240
Well, maybe you'd rather
talk about vegetables, huh?

19:01.323 --> 19:04.284
Like your favorite stalk of
celery that just walked in.

19:04.368 --> 19:06.954
Yeah, looks like she's lost
a little bit of her crunch.

19:07.037 --> 19:09.081
What the fuck is she doin' back here?

19:14.336 --> 19:15.379
Hi.

19:15.463 --> 19:17.006
Inmate, no touching.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.258
Yeah, inmate. Let's
just keep it orthodox.

19:19.341 --> 19:22.595
What happened? What
are you doing back here?

19:22.678 --> 19:24.054
And...

19:24.138 --> 19:25.640
What happened to your face?

19:26.807 --> 19:29.351
Just a little trouble in
lockup. I was in a mood.

19:30.686 --> 19:33.814
I forgot that you should let
crackheads have their way.

19:33.898 --> 19:34.982
Well, yeah.

19:35.065 --> 19:36.567
Crackheads...

19:36.651 --> 19:37.693
Wookiees...

19:37.777 --> 19:39.444
you know, you gotta let 'em win.

19:40.488 --> 19:43.105
What... did you do?

19:43.107 --> 19:46.536
This is so unbelievably embarrassing.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.203
Come on.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.534
Like anybody in here can judge.

19:52.708 --> 19:54.126
How am I back here?

19:55.377 --> 19:57.732
That's my question. Come on.

19:58.548 --> 20:00.550
[stammers] Let's go take a walk.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.718
[Taystee] But can't real
faith make shit happen?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.845
Look, who knows anything, all right?

20:04.929 --> 20:06.346
All I'm saying is, they did some kind of

20:06.430 --> 20:07.723
voodoo spell on Vee,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.183
and, boom, bitch was gone.

20:09.266 --> 20:10.309
Yo.

20:10.851 --> 20:13.187
Vee is fine.

20:13.270 --> 20:14.897
- [Taystee] Oh, my God.
- Yo, okay.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.732
I cannot go through this again.

20:16.816 --> 20:22.446
Suzanne... you throw that
tray, or anything on it,

20:22.530 --> 20:24.532
we dog-pilin' on you till you're flat.

20:24.615 --> 20:26.992
- Mmm-hmm.
- Agree to disagree,

20:27.076 --> 20:28.744
and let's get on with our lives.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.079
Agree to disagree.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.831
Uh-huh. Shit.

20:31.914 --> 20:33.040
Rhymes with, "Vee."

20:33.123 --> 20:35.094
Rhymes with, "Let it be."

20:35.174 --> 20:38.713
So, what you want with
this voodoo magic, anyhow?

20:38.796 --> 20:40.005
[Taystee] Don't be
playin' around with that.

20:40.089 --> 20:43.759
Mess with the evil forces,
you'll be out like Cedric Diggory.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.260
Who?

20:45.344 --> 20:46.539
[both] Harry Potter.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.584
Died in the Triwizard Tournament?

20:48.973 --> 20:50.307
[Poussey] Look, I don't know. I just...

20:50.390 --> 20:51.851
I think it's interestin'.

20:51.934 --> 20:55.563
I mean, who knows what kind of forces
are operatin' out there in the universe?

20:55.646 --> 20:58.482
Maybe it ain't such a bad idea
to try to get 'em on your side.

20:59.483 --> 21:01.944
[Poussey's mom] All right,
Poussey, you read the Calvin part,

21:02.027 --> 21:04.193
I'll be the mom. Here.

21:04.780 --> 21:06.824
"Mom, was I ever a grub?"

21:06.907 --> 21:07.908
"A what?"

21:07.992 --> 21:12.037
"You know, a larva. Did I
really 'pup-ate' at age two?"

21:12.788 --> 21:13.764
"Pu-pate."

21:14.665 --> 21:16.000
Like... poo?

21:16.083 --> 21:19.461
Oh, come on. You know that word
from when we studied butterflies.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.922
The caterpillar goes through
the pupal stage and then...

21:22.006 --> 21:23.257
I love you, Mommy.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.052
Love you, too, baby.

21:27.237 --> 21:28.446
Now, let's keep reading.

21:30.848 --> 21:32.391
I am so excited!

21:32.474 --> 21:34.101
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to go to sleep tonight.

21:34.184 --> 21:35.560
No, you gotta try.

21:35.645 --> 21:37.730
You don't want your baby seeing
you with bags under your eyes.

21:37.813 --> 21:39.523
That's setting a really bad example.

21:39.607 --> 21:42.192
So, how you feelin' about
your first Mother's Day?

21:42.276 --> 21:44.194
- I'm not a mother yet.
- Sure you are.

21:44.278 --> 21:46.951
If she's already givin' you pain
and trouble, you're a mother.

21:47.322 --> 21:48.490
And I'm a mother.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.743
You getting me a present tomorrow
for all I've done for you?

21:51.368 --> 21:53.453
Don't I just cause you pain and trouble?

21:53.537 --> 21:55.303
At least get me a card or something.

21:56.331 --> 21:58.167
Draw me one of your weird pictures.

21:59.877 --> 22:01.128
Give me my stuff!

22:01.211 --> 22:04.131
Oh, no? Something to hide?

22:04.214 --> 22:06.842
Love letters, maybe, from
all those men in your life?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.385
This is fancy.

22:08.468 --> 22:09.469
Greenwich, Connecticut?

22:09.553 --> 22:10.971
Who the fuck you know in
Greenwich, Connecticut?

22:11.055 --> 22:12.932
No one. I was gonna
throw it out. It's stupid.

22:13.015 --> 22:14.934
"I've heard I'm to have a grandchild.

22:15.017 --> 22:16.601
I'd like to see you.

22:16.686 --> 22:18.979
Sincerely, Delia Mendez Powell."

22:19.772 --> 22:20.981
Mendez?

22:20.983 --> 22:23.131
Holy shit! This is Pornstache's mother?

22:24.526 --> 22:27.029
Yo, I smell money
here. You gotta say yes.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.864
Write her back and
tell her you'll see her.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.866
'Cause I need another
person involved here, right?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.702
I don't wanna see her.

22:34.912 --> 22:37.832
Fine. Don't listen to your mother.

22:37.915 --> 22:40.292
'Cause that always works out so well.

22:44.171 --> 22:47.049
So, listen... I got a guy.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.592
You are a guy.

22:48.675 --> 22:49.969
Suck my dick.

22:52.722 --> 22:55.224
He's comin' up the tunnel on
Wednesday. He's gonna sell it for us.

22:55.307 --> 22:56.934
So we gotta get that
shit to the greenhouse.

22:57.017 --> 22:59.269
So far, the best plan we've come up with

22:59.353 --> 23:01.605
is takin' it out one bag
at a time up our snatches

23:01.688 --> 23:04.524
while the meth-heads take
their afternoon naps, okay?

23:04.608 --> 23:06.942
And that plan has more holes
in it than we have, doesn't it?

23:07.652 --> 23:10.823
All right, we need to space
these pompoms out more evenly.

23:11.441 --> 23:13.617
I'm a wacky clown. I
don't need symmetry.

23:13.700 --> 23:16.245
And you're stallin'. It's time.

23:16.328 --> 23:19.289
It's so pretty. I like looking at it.

23:19.373 --> 23:22.542
Yeah, well, say goodbye,
'cause come Wednesday,

23:22.626 --> 23:25.838
that shit is going down the tunnel
and out into the world for sale...

23:25.921 --> 23:27.339
like a Romanian baby.

23:27.977 --> 23:29.383
This shit is happenin'.

23:32.803 --> 23:35.305
[Gina] I take this
ball of blue energy...

23:37.557 --> 23:39.434
and I pass it to you.

23:43.355 --> 23:46.108
I take this ball of blue
energy and I pass it...

23:46.191 --> 23:47.902
[Frieda] You sure you
want to do this, Red?

23:47.985 --> 23:50.988
I've only got two years left, Frieda.

23:51.071 --> 23:55.826
Compared to what I was looking at
when I got here, that's so little time.

23:55.910 --> 23:58.120
I see the light at
the end of the tunnel.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.538
[chuckles] So to speak.

23:59.621 --> 24:02.875
[grunts] How much time we got before
we have to rejoin the witch ladies?

24:02.958 --> 24:04.126
Oh, about a half hour.

24:04.209 --> 24:07.171
It takes 'em forever to pass
that ball around the circle.

24:07.254 --> 24:09.298
It drives Maxwell nuts.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.879
She smokes by the basketball
courts till they're done.

24:11.881 --> 24:13.635
And this is okay with Caputo?

24:13.718 --> 24:18.509
Oh, it's a whole new world around
here. A kinder, gentler Litchfield.

24:18.849 --> 24:21.351
Wiccans get night
walks on the full moon.

24:21.435 --> 24:24.354
Things that break get mostly fixed.

24:24.438 --> 24:28.400
I even hear people
are getting out early.

24:28.483 --> 24:31.070
Uh, Sanchez in the kitchen,

24:31.153 --> 24:35.074
that, uh... that girl with
the nostrils from grounds crew.

24:35.157 --> 24:36.616
[panting] All the
more reason to do this.

24:36.700 --> 24:38.994
Are you sure? Are you really sure?

24:39.078 --> 24:41.246
We had a good thing goin' here, Red.

24:41.330 --> 24:42.581
[grunting]

24:43.582 --> 24:44.834
I'm sure.

24:46.293 --> 24:47.794
Bye-bye, tunnel.

24:48.963 --> 24:50.089
[groans]

24:51.340 --> 24:53.592
[Gina] And ye shall
be free from slavery.

24:54.593 --> 24:57.637
And as a sign that ye be really free...

24:57.721 --> 25:00.182
ye shall be naked in thy rites.

25:00.265 --> 25:01.976
And ye shall dance...

25:03.102 --> 25:05.062
Wait, don't do that.

25:05.145 --> 25:06.540
It's metaphorical naked.

25:06.542 --> 25:09.231
I mean, we're passing around an
invisible ball, for Christ's sake.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.443
I thought we didn't believe in Christ.

25:11.526 --> 25:12.903
[Frieda] Better hurry.

25:12.987 --> 25:14.488
[Red] Almost finished.

25:17.824 --> 25:19.994
You're a twisted fuck, aren't ya?

25:20.487 --> 25:22.246
Life is complex, huh?

25:22.746 --> 25:24.414
Let's rejoin the circle.

25:24.498 --> 25:27.084
I could use some energy,
blue or otherwise.

25:27.167 --> 25:28.210
[grunts]

25:29.452 --> 25:30.754
Healy, I wanna go home.

25:30.837 --> 25:32.797
You haven't answered my question.

25:32.882 --> 25:36.843
Why is Rogers here?
I started Safe Place.

25:36.927 --> 25:39.930
These women trust me, okay?
And I'm good at my job, Joe.

25:40.014 --> 25:42.474
She's here because she's needed.

25:42.557 --> 25:44.309
We never replaced Callahan.

25:44.393 --> 25:45.895
We all know Bailey is senile.

25:46.176 --> 25:50.024
For months, you're tellin' me how
swamped you are, how overwhelmed.

25:50.107 --> 25:51.691
Okay, I take it back. I'm fine.

25:51.775 --> 25:53.903
Let her go. I've got it covered, okay?

25:55.041 --> 25:55.897
No.

25:57.697 --> 25:59.658
Fine, then she can have all
the blacks and the crazies.

26:00.780 --> 26:01.495
Healy...

26:01.497 --> 26:03.620
Look, I've got a bad
feeling about this one.

26:03.703 --> 26:05.747
She doesn't smell right,
and I mean that literally.

26:05.749 --> 26:08.706
She's got a weird smell.
Have you noticed that?

26:08.708 --> 26:09.681
Sam!

26:10.252 --> 26:11.921
She's here now.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.172
She's your coworker.

26:14.307 --> 26:17.269
Eh, be nice, be respectful.

26:18.552 --> 26:20.137
Come on, be a gentleman.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.639
[Healy's mom] Yes, my little gentleman.

26:22.851 --> 26:24.593
Gentleman Sam.

26:25.696 --> 26:27.031
Yes, and yes again!

26:27.384 --> 26:29.901
Because the angels have spoken to me...

26:30.272 --> 26:32.441
[softly] and they've
told me their secrets.

26:33.900 --> 26:35.460
I brought you breakfast.

26:39.573 --> 26:41.325
Now it's a party!

26:41.408 --> 26:43.160
Come dance with Mommy.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.236
[Alex] Is your mom coming?

26:53.253 --> 26:54.448
Are you kidding me?

26:55.130 --> 26:58.258
Carol is spending the day with
her un-imprisoned children.

26:58.260 --> 26:59.261
Mmm.

27:02.429 --> 27:05.890
Diane would smack the shit out
of me if she were still alive.

27:05.975 --> 27:07.184
[sniffles]

27:09.144 --> 27:12.205
She's probably looking
down right now just...

27:13.482 --> 27:15.730
vomiting angel dust.

27:19.127 --> 27:21.161
I feel so stupid.

27:22.032 --> 27:23.757
You were living in Queens.

27:24.368 --> 27:27.204
I'm sure that made prison
seem much more attractive.

27:28.705 --> 27:31.208
Every time I close my
eyes, I relive that moment.

27:31.581 --> 27:33.418
Fuck up. Fuck up.

27:33.502 --> 27:34.458
Alex...

27:34.460 --> 27:37.171
[sobbing] I had a chance to make a life.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.299
Okay, you need to shut up.

27:41.051 --> 27:42.052
[Alex whimpers]

27:42.886 --> 27:44.054
[sniffles]

27:45.639 --> 27:48.267
Oh, that's not hot when your
snot drips in my mouth like that.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.351
- No?
- No.

27:49.434 --> 27:51.561
- It's not your thing?
- No, I don't like that.

27:51.645 --> 27:53.397
[chuckles] I thought you'd be into it.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.481
Mmm-mmm.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.193
[sobbing]

27:59.486 --> 28:01.113
I'm such an idiot.

28:01.196 --> 28:03.506
No, Alex...

28:05.034 --> 28:07.827
You have to stop. You have
to. It wasn't your fault.

28:07.911 --> 28:09.463
Of course it was my fault!

28:10.039 --> 28:11.929
No one put that gun in my hand.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.718
- But you didn't know.
- Fuck up!

28:13.833 --> 28:15.627
Alex, it wasn't you.

28:15.912 --> 28:17.163
It wasn't you.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.300
It...

28:30.559 --> 28:32.102
[softly] It was the system.

28:35.064 --> 28:36.398
You got caught...

28:37.732 --> 28:39.318
in the system.

28:40.860 --> 28:44.489
I'm just a fly in the web of
the prison industrial complex?

28:44.573 --> 28:46.158
[scoffs] Christ.

28:46.241 --> 28:48.577
But at least we're in
the same web, right?

28:50.579 --> 28:52.456
I mean, at least we're in it together.

28:54.708 --> 28:55.792
Yeah.

28:57.127 --> 28:58.462
At least we're in it together.

28:58.545 --> 28:59.796
[Donaldson] Ladies!

28:59.879 --> 29:02.006
Get the heck out of there right now!

29:02.091 --> 29:04.801
You're out of bounds! Count's in five!

29:06.095 --> 29:08.472
I know you're back
there! I'm not an idiot!

29:08.555 --> 29:11.350
Out now! You're both gettin' shots!

29:24.028 --> 29:25.614
Place is goin' to hell.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.824
Hands off! And fingers off!

29:27.907 --> 29:30.577
Back away from the table!
And nobody touch me.

29:30.660 --> 29:33.080
If anybody touches me, you don't go in.

29:34.289 --> 29:37.251
You are all expected to behave.

29:37.334 --> 29:40.044
Anyone not behaving
will be sent back home.

29:40.516 --> 29:42.756
All caregivers must be reachable

29:42.839 --> 29:46.510
in case your children you've
checked in need to be sent back out.

29:47.552 --> 29:48.928
Welcome to the fun zone.

29:49.286 --> 29:50.788
Mother's last name?

29:50.806 --> 29:53.141
I think you know it.
How you doin', my friend?

29:53.975 --> 29:55.269
Fine. Fine.

29:55.352 --> 29:57.479
Yeah? Glad to hear it.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.523
So, listen, I got a couple of
your baby's aunts and uncle here.

29:59.606 --> 30:00.982
[softly] Hey, can you
please keep it down?

30:01.065 --> 30:02.692
Stop sweatin' it, bro.
Nobody's listenin'.

30:03.652 --> 30:04.653
Uh, names?

30:04.736 --> 30:06.613
You're gonna have to learn
these soon, too, hermano.

30:06.696 --> 30:11.160
Eva, Lucy, Christina,
and that's Emiliano.

30:12.024 --> 30:13.287
So, listen, you should
come by the house soon,

30:13.370 --> 30:14.413
you know, get to know us.

30:14.496 --> 30:17.832
I'm not just busting balls,
okay? You're family now.

30:18.190 --> 30:19.709
Okay, here are your badges.
[chuckles awkwardly] Have a nice day.

30:19.793 --> 30:20.835
All right, go ahead, kids.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.255
Go give your mother a
big hug and a kiss for me.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.464
And Emiliano...

30:24.548 --> 30:26.800
no tongue, you little perv.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.303
Happy Mother's Day, Johnny boy.

30:30.554 --> 30:31.971
[all cheering]

30:45.277 --> 30:46.570
[boy] This blows!

30:46.653 --> 30:47.904
[puppies yapping]

30:53.577 --> 30:55.119
[imitating airplane engine]

30:56.297 --> 30:59.633
Hey, Warren! You know
you're not allowed out there.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.919
Yeah, but I made a kite,
Mr. Healy. Kids love kites.

31:03.002 --> 31:05.214
That may be true, but you've been banned

31:05.297 --> 31:07.882
from interacting with the
children, and you know that.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.884
Yeah, that was last year.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.930
And this is a kite,
not Chinese jump rope.

31:14.278 --> 31:16.140
The answer is no, Warren.

31:17.313 --> 31:20.509
Now, you're not to step foot
outside of this building.

31:21.188 --> 31:22.189
Is that clear?

31:23.607 --> 31:24.733
Yes, sir.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.378
[Brook] Everyone needs
to back up and line up.

31:44.768 --> 31:46.505
Okay, okay, who's first?

31:47.076 --> 31:48.465
Where's the stick?

31:48.548 --> 31:49.674
Sticks? We can't give 'em sticks.

31:49.968 --> 31:51.551
How are they supposed
to break the piñata?

31:51.635 --> 31:53.428
I don't know. Punch it, I guess.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.680
Give it a good shot in the
side, work out their anger.

31:55.764 --> 31:57.766
They're having fun. They're not angry.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.017
Sure they are.

31:59.107 --> 32:02.661
Hey, kid, your mother is in prison.

32:02.921 --> 32:03.855
Pummel the piñata.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.430
Jab, jab.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.476
Hit it.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.675
All right.

32:17.118 --> 32:18.161
[gasps]

32:18.245 --> 32:20.622
No, you look really good!

32:20.705 --> 32:22.374
You could, like, leave
here and go straight to

32:22.457 --> 32:24.668
a My Chemical Romance
concert and be the balls.

32:26.044 --> 32:30.549
[exclaims] You missed! Next! Loser.

32:30.632 --> 32:32.717
Why you being so fuckin'
mean, man? They're kids.

32:32.801 --> 32:36.471
Number one, they miss, mo' candy for me.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.307
And number two, I don't like kids.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.184
I don't like mamas,
neither, for that matter.

32:41.268 --> 32:42.644
Mine thinks I'm shit.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.938
Well, fuck her. I'm done with mama.

32:45.021 --> 32:47.274
- I'm done with stand-ins for mamas.
- Mmm.

32:47.357 --> 32:49.651
I am parent-free and proud.

32:50.127 --> 32:52.028
Yeah, well, I liked my moms.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.657
Well, lucky you.

32:53.822 --> 32:54.989
[girl] Oh, come on.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.676
Maybe when mine dies,
I'll like her better.

32:57.992 --> 32:59.588
A'ight, next!

33:00.078 --> 33:01.434
Shit.

33:02.032 --> 33:05.322
- Simon says deep breath in.
- [all inhaling]

33:06.170 --> 33:08.962
- Simon says deep breath out.
- [all exhaling]

33:09.045 --> 33:10.046
Hands in the air.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.967
Chang, Simon didn't say that.

33:14.050 --> 33:15.635
- [kids laughing]
- But that's okay.

33:15.719 --> 33:19.806
I encourage you all to
follow your own path.

33:19.889 --> 33:21.850
What you in for?

33:21.933 --> 33:24.644
[Yoga Jones] Simon says tug at your ear.

33:24.728 --> 33:27.188
[Yoga Jones] Tug at your other ear.

33:27.271 --> 33:30.484
Simon says wiggle your hips.

33:30.567 --> 33:32.694
Simon says hop on one foot!

33:32.777 --> 33:35.489
- Duck.
- [Yoga Jones] Simon says wiggle your hips.

33:35.572 --> 33:37.532
- Duck.
- [Yoga Jones] Jump up in the air!

33:37.616 --> 33:39.534
- Simon says turn around.
- Duck.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.786
- [Yoga Jones] Don't turn around.
- Goose.

33:41.870 --> 33:44.831
[Yoga Jones] Simon
says hands on your head.

33:46.165 --> 33:49.419
- Simon says hands on your knees.
- [girl] Duck...

33:49.503 --> 33:51.588
Use his shirt like a paper towel.

33:51.671 --> 33:53.047
He loves it.

33:53.131 --> 33:56.551
One, two, three, go.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.219
[kids exclaiming]

33:59.721 --> 34:01.765
Yo, hey, hey! Get
out... Get out of here!

34:01.848 --> 34:03.683
- [kids giggling]
- Get out of here!

34:03.767 --> 34:06.395
You! You better get out of
here! Where's your mother, boy?

34:06.478 --> 34:08.257
Get out of here!

34:08.260 --> 34:10.676
I don't understand. Why
isn't your brother here?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.168
He says it's for babies.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.212
I haven't seen him in
two and a half years.

34:18.407 --> 34:21.117
Look at you. You got a mustache?

34:21.199 --> 34:22.994
Jesus. [chuckles]

34:23.077 --> 34:24.161
You got hair everywhere?

34:24.245 --> 34:25.329
Oh, Mom!

34:25.414 --> 34:27.658
Never mind. Don't
answer that. I can't...

34:28.248 --> 34:29.793
It's good to see you.

34:29.876 --> 34:31.210
You, too.

34:31.293 --> 34:32.532
Lourdes treating you good?

34:32.619 --> 34:34.714
We're fine. She and Benny fight a lot.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.969
They had a crazy one when he got
suspended from school last week.

34:38.766 --> 34:39.934
What'd he get suspended for?

34:40.016 --> 34:41.185
Cutting class.

34:41.804 --> 34:43.973
So, he misses school and they
make him miss more school,

34:44.056 --> 34:45.475
that makes no sense.

34:45.559 --> 34:48.143
Jesus, what the hell? Cutting class.

34:48.226 --> 34:49.478
You know what?

34:49.563 --> 34:51.565
You tell him that he needs to
get his little delinquent ass

34:51.648 --> 34:54.358
over here next week for
visitation, you got that?

34:54.443 --> 34:55.569
Okay.

34:56.610 --> 34:57.821
[sighs]

34:58.142 --> 34:59.351
I'm sorry, papi.

35:00.281 --> 35:02.033
- You're here, right?
- Yeah.

35:02.035 --> 35:04.379
Yeah, let's talk about you, huh?

35:05.412 --> 35:07.956
What you been up to for the
last 30 months? Fun things?

35:08.957 --> 35:11.585
- [girl groans]
- All right, next.

35:11.668 --> 35:13.795
[inmate 1] Yeah, I'm glad you're here.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.339
- [Taystee] You was just here.
- You made my day.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.677
[Black Cindy chuckles]
She made it. Next.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.972
Grandma's not a clown.
This is eye shadow.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.807
Grandma put on a face for you.

35:25.890 --> 35:29.060
Please, I'm gorgeous. [clicks tongue]

35:29.143 --> 35:31.312
[inmate 2] I know what
you're saying, but...

35:47.203 --> 35:50.081
- All right, honey, take a little spritz.
- Mmm-mmm.

35:50.164 --> 35:53.543
What, no? Be a filthy
animal. Who raised you, huh?

35:53.627 --> 35:54.669
Oh, hi, Annette.

35:56.031 --> 35:58.476
There you go. Wipe front to
back, throw it in the trash.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.674
Thank you very much.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.092
This is a nice setup you got here.

36:01.175 --> 36:02.260
Oh, you.

36:02.343 --> 36:05.388
You are so lucky you are in electrical.

36:05.472 --> 36:07.098
Listen, you want my company or not?

36:07.540 --> 36:09.643
Yes, I do. Sit her down.

36:09.726 --> 36:11.185
- All right.
- Yeah.

36:12.311 --> 36:13.522
Look at this shit, right?

36:13.605 --> 36:15.774
I mean, look at this,
with these fuckin' kids.

36:15.857 --> 36:16.983
Oh, they're everywhere.

36:17.066 --> 36:18.109
I hate kids.

36:18.192 --> 36:20.319
You know, they don't drink,
they haven't traveled.

36:21.905 --> 36:23.823
It's nasty in there. You
might wanna hold your breath.

36:23.907 --> 36:25.742
Hey, can I talk to you?

36:26.826 --> 36:28.889
Um, I mean, I can wait
till you're finished.

36:29.496 --> 36:32.040
This mad juju that you and Gloria do...

36:32.999 --> 36:34.371
how does it work?

36:35.084 --> 36:36.503
I'm really missing someone.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.094
Is the baby gonna live with us?

36:45.178 --> 36:46.283
Um...

36:46.930 --> 36:48.116
We'll see.

36:48.765 --> 36:50.058
"We'll see"?

36:50.141 --> 36:51.225
What the fuck is that?

36:51.865 --> 36:53.477
I'm gonna be a tía.

36:53.496 --> 36:54.622
[Bennett] Hey.

36:54.771 --> 36:56.056
Hi, there.

36:56.058 --> 36:57.435
Everyone having fun?

36:58.733 --> 36:59.901
[Dayanara sighs]

37:01.094 --> 37:03.441
Um, I have a Mother's Day joke.

37:03.988 --> 37:06.908
How come computers are so smart?

37:06.991 --> 37:08.492
It's 'cause they listen
to their motherboards.

37:10.870 --> 37:12.539
Do you get it? That's
what they call the...

37:12.622 --> 37:13.873
It's the board thingy in the computer.

37:13.957 --> 37:16.960
I think it's, like, what all
the circuits are... attached to.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.366
- It's motherboard, 'cause...
- [Aleida clears throat]

37:23.550 --> 37:24.808
All right, well, anyway, have a...

37:25.594 --> 37:27.534
have a great afternoon, so...

37:33.935 --> 37:35.436
CO Bennett, let's chat.

37:37.146 --> 37:39.023
When are you gonna learn
to leave well enough alone?

37:39.107 --> 37:40.817
We were just talking.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.820
I do you a solid and sweep
everything under the carpet,

37:43.903 --> 37:45.572
and you go around
lifting up the corners.

37:45.655 --> 37:48.532
"Hey, everybody, look, look.
Look what I got under here."

37:48.617 --> 37:51.077
Okay, respectfully, sir, I'm pretty
sure you did yourself a solid.

37:52.704 --> 37:56.827
You think you're the only one
ever to be tempted by an inmate?

37:57.250 --> 38:00.879
You think I never saw a tight piece
sitting in my office chair crying,

38:00.962 --> 38:02.714
tears covering her khaki-covered tits,

38:02.797 --> 38:05.549
and thought, "I could
bend that over my inbox"?

38:06.101 --> 38:08.678
A lesser man would be using this place

38:08.762 --> 38:12.265
as his own personal pussy smorgasbord,

38:12.348 --> 38:15.018
every fucking color, shape, size.

38:15.101 --> 38:17.388
Around the world without
ever leaving upstate.

38:17.687 --> 38:19.063
But I am not a lesser man.

38:20.273 --> 38:22.150
When those feelings come
on me, you know what I do?

38:22.233 --> 38:23.276
Please don't tell me.

38:23.359 --> 38:25.779
I take care of my fucking self.

38:26.149 --> 38:27.947
- Do you know what I'm saying?
- I'm pretty sure I do.

38:28.031 --> 38:29.073
I spank it out, Bennett.

38:29.157 --> 38:30.408
Uh, it's...

38:30.491 --> 38:33.119
And for the love of Pete,
I suggest you do the same...

38:33.202 --> 38:36.831
like decent men have been
doing since time immemorial.

38:39.375 --> 38:43.379
Me and Diaz, it's about
more than sex... sir.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.300
Just stay away from her, okay?

38:48.342 --> 38:49.803
Poor, deluded fuck.

38:49.886 --> 38:51.012
What'd you say?

38:55.224 --> 38:58.189
I mean, I just feel bad
because it's her day, you know?

38:58.435 --> 39:01.064
And she's just sitting
in the car while I'm here.

39:01.147 --> 39:02.857
I didn't mean to steal your mom's day.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.401
Yeah, well, I don't need another mother.

39:07.028 --> 39:08.402
I get that.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.074
So, how are things with the good pastor?

39:11.157 --> 39:12.616
He makin' your mom happy?

39:12.701 --> 39:13.860
Yeah, I guess.

39:14.178 --> 39:15.995
How about you? Gettin' along?

39:16.573 --> 39:18.289
Well, he taught me how to shave.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.777
What'd he say about that?

39:21.292 --> 39:24.628
He tell you to go down,
shave with the grain?

39:24.713 --> 39:27.048
No, up and against the grain.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.507
That ain't how you do it.

39:28.591 --> 39:30.218
Well, that's what he told me.

39:30.301 --> 39:31.678
Well, I know better.

39:31.761 --> 39:32.971
Now, who you gonna listen to,

39:33.054 --> 39:36.057
someone who just shaves his face
or someone who shaves everywhere?

39:36.282 --> 39:37.558
Ew.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.269
You think that baby over
there is cuter than my girl?

39:43.271 --> 39:44.272
Ay, please.

39:44.559 --> 39:47.443
You have the prettiest
bebecita here, after mine.

39:47.526 --> 39:48.611
I know.

39:48.695 --> 39:49.696
[giggles]

39:51.364 --> 39:53.032
[Maria] Ay, look at her.

39:53.116 --> 39:54.993
She looks terrified.

39:55.076 --> 39:56.828
- [Maritza] Oh, she'll come around.
- [Maria] Mmm-hmm.

39:56.911 --> 39:59.748
I mean, what's more
beautiful than having a baby?

39:59.831 --> 40:01.249
Making a life?

40:01.332 --> 40:02.709
The smell of their heads,

40:02.792 --> 40:05.461
the way they put their whole
weight on you when they fall asleep.

40:05.544 --> 40:07.088
She's gonna fall in love,
and then she'll be fine.

40:07.171 --> 40:08.422
Mmm-hmm.

40:09.259 --> 40:12.135
Ay, chica, you got a little
something on your shirt there.

40:12.218 --> 40:15.304
- What is that? Piss or shit?
- Oh, it smells like shit.

40:15.388 --> 40:18.767
Oh, my God! This is so disgusting!

40:20.226 --> 40:22.145
- Here, take it! Take it!
- Eh?

40:22.228 --> 40:23.562
[Maritza] So gross!

40:23.646 --> 40:25.481
[speaking Spanish] Hey, what am
I supposed to do with this baby?

40:25.564 --> 40:26.649
[speaking English] Give it to my sister!

40:26.733 --> 40:28.484
[grunting]

40:28.567 --> 40:30.403
Okay, this is gettin' ridiculous.

40:30.486 --> 40:32.530
Kids, stand back.

40:38.828 --> 40:40.496
[kids exclaiming]

40:44.708 --> 40:46.460
[all screaming excitedly]

40:53.467 --> 40:54.761
- [boy] There's no candy.
- Where's the candy?

40:54.844 --> 40:56.137
- [girl] It's empty.
- Oh, my God.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.264
This is such a metaphor for their lives.

40:58.347 --> 40:59.348
Didn't you put it in?

40:59.432 --> 41:00.892
I wasn't supposed to put it in.

41:00.975 --> 41:03.686
And I was. Oh, jeez. It's
probably still in the van.

41:03.770 --> 41:05.897
Well, no point getting it now.
There's nothing to put it in.

41:05.980 --> 41:06.873
I'll take it.

41:07.356 --> 41:09.692
[boy] What's a piñata without candy?

41:13.571 --> 41:14.948
[inaudible]

41:20.681 --> 41:23.768
So, aside from the fact that
he don't know how to shave,

41:24.040 --> 41:26.000
I am kind of happy
you have a man around.

41:27.043 --> 41:28.502
Does he give you advice
about girls and stuff?

41:28.586 --> 41:31.255
His advice about girls was...

41:31.339 --> 41:32.506
"Wait until marriage."

41:32.590 --> 41:34.550
Good Lord, one of those.

41:35.634 --> 41:36.886
Now, you want some real advice?

41:36.970 --> 41:39.472
From my second mom or my used-to-be dad?

41:39.938 --> 41:42.766
From former man to current man.

41:43.767 --> 41:47.188
Now, when I was your
age, my dad told me,

41:47.292 --> 41:50.726
"Find a real insecure
girl and practice on her.

41:51.369 --> 41:53.496
That way, when you meet
a girl you really like,

41:53.652 --> 41:55.060
you'll be good at it."

41:55.695 --> 41:59.054
And you really wanna be a lady
in a world where men do that?

42:00.493 --> 42:02.036
God help me, I do.

42:03.434 --> 42:04.998
And you're never tight again.

42:05.081 --> 42:07.853
I mean, you could work
it back a little, but...

42:08.329 --> 42:10.837
it's never the same after
you've torn that shit up.

42:10.920 --> 42:13.131
And you'll always pee yourself
a little when you sneeze,

42:13.214 --> 42:14.798
and you never really sleep again.

42:16.092 --> 42:17.676
You got anything good to say about it?

42:17.961 --> 42:19.588
I just want you to be prepared.

42:20.763 --> 42:23.182
I mean, it's not all bad.
You end up with a baby.

42:23.719 --> 42:25.143
It just ruins your life is all.

42:26.895 --> 42:28.146
You sayin' I ruined your life?

42:28.229 --> 42:29.517
Of course.

42:29.939 --> 42:31.941
The day you was born was the end.

42:33.109 --> 42:34.152
[sighs]

42:34.235 --> 42:36.195
She's just so perfect.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.197
[baby Dayanara coos]

42:38.281 --> 42:42.563
How could anythin' be bad...
if we made somethin' like this?

42:45.204 --> 42:47.456
- [baby Dayanara fussing]
- [shushing]

42:50.293 --> 42:53.207
Anyone seen what's-her-name,
the little one?

42:53.671 --> 42:55.059
She was getting me punch.

42:55.196 --> 42:56.724
I haven't seen her for a while.

42:58.134 --> 42:59.385
Go look for your sister.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.872
Lucy?

43:04.726 --> 43:05.769
Lucy!

43:06.037 --> 43:07.643
Go look for your sister.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.856
Now, this is nice. Mmm.

43:12.941 --> 43:14.692
This makes me happy.

43:16.235 --> 43:17.361
Happy Mother's Day, Ma.

43:17.445 --> 43:19.113
Happy Mother's Day.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.281
[speaking Russian] Your head.

43:20.364 --> 43:21.824
Your beautiful face.

43:21.908 --> 43:25.036
Yes. Well, now it's interesting.

43:25.119 --> 43:29.415
[speaking English] Ma... so, you
ready for things to get goin' again?

43:30.166 --> 43:31.934
[whispers] I got a
brand new LED headlamp.

43:32.793 --> 43:34.878
I think we're going to take
a little break, darling.

43:35.606 --> 43:37.090
Actually, a long one.

43:37.974 --> 43:40.018
It's too much to think about.

43:40.426 --> 43:43.517
I need to think about
the future, getting out,

43:43.625 --> 43:45.974
getting back to my life, my home...

43:46.315 --> 43:47.350
the market.

43:51.312 --> 43:52.771
I need to look forward.

43:52.855 --> 43:53.940
Yeah.

43:56.943 --> 43:58.777
Who's minding the store today?

43:58.861 --> 44:00.113
[scoffs] What you mean, Ma?

44:00.196 --> 44:02.240
[chuckles] What I mean
is, it's Mother's Day.

44:02.323 --> 44:04.117
That's always been a big day for us.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.327
Platters, baskets...

44:06.410 --> 44:08.704
[speaking Russian] We closed for today.

44:08.787 --> 44:10.623
Came to see you instead.

44:11.433 --> 44:13.167
[speaking English] We
can afford to do that?

44:13.251 --> 44:14.296
Yeah.

44:15.044 --> 44:17.546
[speaking Russian] It's fine. It's okay.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.761
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What's goin' on?

44:23.844 --> 44:24.928
Lucy's missing.

44:25.013 --> 44:26.180
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh.

44:26.264 --> 44:27.848
No, stop. What are you doing?

44:27.931 --> 44:28.975
I gotta call it in.

44:29.058 --> 44:30.184
If you call it in, they're
gonna pull the alarm.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.811
The day's over for everybody.
She's here someplace.

44:32.895 --> 44:35.023
- Let me look a little more.
- [sighs]

44:35.106 --> 44:37.566
Okay, look, 20 minutes, okay?
And then I gotta call it in.

44:37.650 --> 44:38.734
All right.

44:40.319 --> 44:41.362
[Pennsatucky] In the name of Jesus,

44:41.445 --> 44:43.447
I ask that the souls of my unborn babies

44:43.531 --> 44:46.742
be considered to enter the Holy Kingdom,

44:46.825 --> 44:49.620
even though they never had
a chance to get baptized

44:49.703 --> 44:50.913
'cause I was wicked

44:51.914 --> 44:53.291
and I got 'em sucked out...

44:54.625 --> 44:56.001
'cause I was weak...

44:57.086 --> 44:58.421
and I didn't know any better.

44:59.755 --> 45:01.299
And I'm sorry.

45:02.675 --> 45:03.967
[sniffles]

45:05.969 --> 45:09.104
I'm sorry that I never
got to be your mama.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.845
Little Blake and Bonnie...

45:13.102 --> 45:15.673
Boyd, Bethany...

45:16.980 --> 45:17.981
Braeden...

45:19.775 --> 45:21.610
and even you, little Buddy Jr.

45:22.778 --> 45:24.988
I see we're fond of the "B" names.

45:26.449 --> 45:27.825
Yeah, I always liked that letter.

45:29.034 --> 45:31.454
It's like a whole little graveyard here.

45:32.830 --> 45:34.748
Yeah, these are all my unborn babies.

45:34.832 --> 45:35.830
Ooh.

45:36.334 --> 45:39.712
♪ She got the Mother's Day blues ♪

45:41.589 --> 45:43.341
Jesus, you look like the Angel of Death.

45:43.424 --> 45:44.550
I get that a lot.

45:45.843 --> 45:48.096
Yeah, I'm goin' to hell. I know it.

45:48.179 --> 45:49.930
I mean, even though I
was saved and everything,

45:50.013 --> 45:51.432
I just...

45:51.515 --> 45:54.059
They never even had a chance, you know?

45:54.143 --> 45:56.562
Son, you gotta let go of that shit.

45:56.865 --> 45:58.021
It's easy for you to say.

45:58.106 --> 46:00.649
I'm guessing you ain't
never had to abort nobody.

46:00.733 --> 46:02.318
A bold assumption.

46:03.736 --> 46:06.905
You ever read a book
called Freakonomics?

46:06.930 --> 46:08.057
No.

46:08.317 --> 46:10.576
What's it about, bearded
ladies and midgets?

46:10.578 --> 46:14.041
Close. It's about economic
theory, cause and effect.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.290
Sounds boring.

46:16.374 --> 46:18.313
Mmm. It's actually a pretty good read.

46:18.933 --> 46:20.628
They have this chapter in it,

46:20.711 --> 46:22.630
"Where Have All the Criminals Gone?"

46:24.215 --> 46:25.424
Over there in that field.

46:25.508 --> 46:26.925
[chuckles]

46:27.009 --> 46:29.052
You know, in the 1990s,

46:29.137 --> 46:31.764
crime fell spectacularly,

46:31.847 --> 46:35.254
and this book attributes that
to the passing of Roe v. Wade.

46:35.518 --> 46:37.145
The Darkness of '73.

46:37.228 --> 46:39.688
The exact opposite, actually.

46:39.772 --> 46:42.441
I mean, the abortions that
occurred after Roe v. Wade...

46:42.525 --> 46:44.402
These were children that weren't wanted.

46:44.485 --> 46:47.613
Children who, if their mothers
had been forced to have them,

46:47.696 --> 46:50.616
would've grown up poor
and neglected and abused,

46:50.699 --> 46:54.787
the three most important ingredients
when one is making a felon.

46:54.870 --> 46:56.539
But they were never born.

46:56.622 --> 46:58.081
So, 20 years later,

46:58.166 --> 47:01.126
when they would've
been of prime crime age,

47:01.210 --> 47:02.628
they weren't there.

47:02.711 --> 47:04.630
And the crime rate... [scoffs]

47:04.713 --> 47:06.590
Dropped dramatically.

47:06.674 --> 47:08.717
- What's your point?
- Well, my point is that

47:08.801 --> 47:11.429
you were a meth-head,
white-trash piece of shit,

47:11.512 --> 47:12.846
and your children, had they been born,

47:12.930 --> 47:15.308
would have been meth-head,
white-trash pieces of shit.

47:15.391 --> 47:17.476
So by terminating those pregnancies,

47:17.560 --> 47:21.605
you spared society the
scourge of your offspring.

47:21.689 --> 47:24.650
I mean, when you think
about it, it's... a blessing.

47:25.693 --> 47:28.153
Never thought about it that way.

47:28.237 --> 47:29.905
Well, maybe you should, hmm?

47:29.988 --> 47:31.782
Maybe you should stop
punishing yourself.

47:31.865 --> 47:33.576
I mean, what does a good mother do?

47:33.659 --> 47:36.078
A good mother does what's
best for her children.

47:36.161 --> 47:38.497
And maybe what was
best for your children

47:38.581 --> 47:41.792
was wipin' 'em out before they had
to lead miserable fucking lives.

47:46.297 --> 47:47.465
Yeah.

47:47.548 --> 47:49.007
Maybe.

47:49.009 --> 47:51.009
It makes me feel a
little better, actually.
