- May I have it, please?
- Have what?

04:25.612 --> 04:28.740
I got it all on film, Yaskov.

04:28.815 --> 04:30.874
You don't wanna deal
with the West Germans.

04:30.950 --> 04:32.975
They don't like
Russian Intelligence.
You know that.

04:33.052 --> 04:35.111

04:35.188 --> 04:37.782

In here, Kendig. Cutter, stay put.
I want to see you after this.

06:02.608 --> 06:05.668
Hi, Myerson.
I thought you were taller.

06:05.745 --> 06:08.543
I don't remember you being this short.
How'd you get so short?

06:08.614 --> 06:10.605

You haven't filed it.

I just got off the airplane.
The job's finished. What's the hurry?

06:26.499 --> 06:29.332

06:29.402 --> 06:32.269

was to dismantle...

three clerks
and a cleaning woman.

06:46.019 --> 06:49.511
And they blew the whistle
on the others. We got
the whole kit and caboodle.

<i>- Yes, dear, I can hear you.</i>

07:46.012 --> 07:47.946

07:48.014 --> 07:50.005

<i>- Tell her no kids,</i>
<i>no pets, no Democrats.</i>

07:53.953 --> 07:56.353
<i>Yes, dear.</i>
<i>Oh, one last thing.</i>

07:56.422 --> 07:59.482
<i>The dinner is formal.</i>
<i>I called Mrs. Blandforth</i>
<i>to make certain.</i>

<i>Good. I can wear</i>

08:02.028 --> 08:05.225

<i>- Good-bye, dear.</i>

08:05.298 --> 08:08.529
- May I say something now?
- We've got a house near Savannah.

08:08.601 --> 08:10.831
She won't give it up.
Says it's close to her mother.

08:10.903 --> 08:12.837
She never wants
to use it though.

08:12.905 --> 08:17.604
I never intended to arrest Yaskov.
I wanted him to stay right where he is.

08:17.677 --> 08:19.668
You wanted.

08:19.745 --> 08:22.305
Yes, I wanted.

08:22.381 --> 08:25.248
I've know the man for 20 years.
I know how he thinks.
I know how he acts.

08:25.318 --> 08:27.718
We take him out,
they put another man in.

08:27.787 --> 08:29.755
<i>It takes us six months</i>

08:41.933 --> 08:43.924
That's the bottom line, isn't it?

08:44.003 --> 08:48.599
I don't even begin to understand
the relevancy of that.

08:48.674 --> 08:52.838

- It's not your station!
It's our station!

08:52.912 --> 08:55.107
You should've learned
that one a long time ago.

08:55.181 --> 08:57.206
You weren't there

08:57.283 --> 08:59.649
You were there

The good news is
I'm putting your friend
Joe Cutter in your place.

09:24.343 --> 09:26.277
- Joe Cutter's a very good man.
- Yes, he is.

09:26.345 --> 09:28.370

younger than you are.

09:28.447 --> 09:32.008

09:32.084 --> 09:35.645
I don't believe you're this upset
because of that Russian in Munich.

09:35.721 --> 09:39.088
Damn it. I hate a man
who doesn't know when
the party is over.

09:39.158 --> 09:41.718
You will get that report
together, won't you?

09:41.794 --> 09:44.456
And you can file it yourself
Monday morning.

09:46.132 --> 09:48.760

Myerson?

09:48.834 --> 09:50.893

Did you have the Redkskins
last Sunday?

10:30.476 --> 10:32.944

Red wine? White? French? German?

I don't know. What's good

12:46.078 --> 12:49.946

12:51.617 --> 12:55.018
Well, frankly, l... I, um...

12:55.087 --> 12:57.954
hadn't quite made a decision

12:58.023 --> 13:01.515
- Is wine that important?
- Very important.

13:01.594 --> 13:04.859
Do you prefer young wine
or one slightly older?

13:04.930 --> 13:06.898
Oh, slightly... slightly older.

13:06.966 --> 13:10.424
Mm. As a general rule,
the older wines are better.

13:10.503 --> 13:13.995
It takes time for the elements
in wine to resolve themselves...

13:14.073 --> 13:16.007
into an harmonious whole.

13:16.075 --> 13:18.669
It takes time and oxygen.

13:20.279 --> 13:23.976
- Are you serious?
- Deadly serious.

13:24.049 --> 13:26.381
Wine is not
a disembodied essence.

13:26.452 --> 13:30.047
It is the product of skill,
knowledge and, in many cases, love.

- You're American.

You are all interested in fitness,

You think wine is bad
for your liver and your heart.

13:57.683 --> 14:01.312
This is completely not true.

14:01.387 --> 14:04.982
It is the drinking of wine that makes
it possible to eat the rich food...

14:05.057 --> 14:07.048
which is bad for your liver
and your heart...

14:07.126 --> 14:09.754

01:02:25.688 --> 01:02:28.851
Here's your tea, dear.
Nice and hot, with lemon.
Just the way you like it.

01:02:28.925 --> 01:02:30.859
I don't like lemon.
I like milk.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:34.124
Now, is there anything else
that I can get for you boys?

01:02:34.197 --> 01:02:37.166
Well, don't work
Mr. Cutter too hard.
After all, it is Sunday.

01:02:37.233 --> 01:02:41.067
I'm sure he needs his rest. If you
need me, I'll be in the sewing room.

01:02:41.137 --> 01:02:44.402
Should have terminated her
20 years ago.

01:02:44.474 --> 01:02:49.844
Joe, maybe we've been going
about this the wrong way.

01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:51.903
Perhaps it needs
a lighter touch.

01:02:51.981 --> 01:02:55.473
You know, sometimes bullying
people doesn't work.

01:02:55.551 --> 01:02:57.883
Let's be sophisticated here.

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:01.822
Maybe we can use a carrot
instead of a stick.

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:05.052
Kendig likes girls,
doesn't he?

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:07.187
Listen, Myerson,
let me make a suggestion.

01:03:07.263 --> 01:03:10.721
Why don't I go over to Salzburg
and have a little talk with Isobel?

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.860
We worked together once.
Maybe she'll listen
to what I have to say.

01:03:15.138 --> 01:03:19.097
Have you got something
going on with Isobel too?

01:03:19.175 --> 01:03:22.269
We're always
one step behind him.

01:03:22.345 --> 01:03:25.576
I'd like to get one step ahead
of the arrogant son of a bitch.

01:03:25.648 --> 01:03:29.049
I thought you liked
the arrogant son of a bitch?

01:03:29.118 --> 01:03:33.077
- Welcome to London, Mr. Ross.
Business or pleasure?
- Oh, yes.

01:03:33.156 --> 01:03:35.784
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh. [Chuckles] A little of both.

01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:39.726
- I'm here to see my publisher.
I'm writing a book.
- How long do you plan to stay?

01:03:39.796 --> 01:03:43.698
That depends.
I'm waiting for some colleagues
to catch up with me.

01:03:43.766 --> 01:03:45.700
- Enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.

01:03:45.768 --> 01:03:47.702
- What's the name of the book?
<i>- Hopscotch.</i>

01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.761
Good title.

01:04:03.486 --> 01:04:05.420
- Glen.
- How are you doing?

01:04:05.488 --> 01:04:09.083
- Will she see us?
- She'll see you. You won't get
anywhere. I've already tried.

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:12.355
Well, maybe she'll be
more accessible to me.
I'm an old friend.

01:04:12.428 --> 01:04:16.626
- Yaskov's in town.
He wants to see you.
- That's good. I'd like that.

01:04:16.699 --> 01:04:18.929
Set a time and place
for this afternoon.

01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:22.198
You're looking very tired, Joe.

01:04:22.271 --> 01:04:26.503
- It's the jet lag.
I can't get used to it.
- You sure that's all it is?

01:04:26.576 --> 01:04:30.478
Now, listen, Isobel. We're
both fond of this character...

01:04:30.546 --> 01:04:34.107
but he's making an ass of himself,
and he's got to cut it out.

01:04:34.183 --> 01:04:37.675
- For his own good.
- For his own good?

01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:40.984
You've been trying to stop him,
and I gather not having
too much success.

01:04:41.057 --> 01:04:43.651
Such a shame.
All those bright young men.

01:04:43.726 --> 01:04:47.787
And there he is,
single-handedly running
rings around you all.

01:04:47.864 --> 01:04:50.264
He's very good.
He's as good as they come.

01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:53.791
And he is running rings around us,
and I'm his biggest fan.

01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:56.964
But Kendig is going
to make a mistake.

01:04:57.039 --> 01:05:00.634
<i>Sooner or later, he's bound to slip.</i>
<i>After all, he's only human.</i>

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:04.976
- Oh, he's extremely human.
<i>- It's not funny, Isobel.</i>

01:05:05.047 --> 01:05:09.484
We're not the only people
looking for him. If the Russians
get to him before we do...

01:05:09.552 --> 01:05:14.012
You mean Myerson's methods
of termination are more humane
than the Russians'?

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.957
You know what I mean.

01:05:17.026 --> 01:05:21.554
I don't want to hurt him, Isobel.
But I have a job to do,
and I'm going to do it.

01:05:21.631 --> 01:05:23.895
He's got to stop
that book right now.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:28.460
<i>He's had his fun. He's made</i>
<i>a fool out of everyone.</i>
<i>Now he has to stop.</i>

01:05:28.538 --> 01:05:31.371
He has to stop
if he's going to stay alive.

01:05:32.642 --> 01:05:36.271
- Will you tell him?
- Oh, I'll tell him.

01:05:36.345 --> 01:05:38.438
I don't think he'll stop.

01:05:38.514 --> 01:05:40.880
Oh. You've forgotten your beer.

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:54.894
- Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Ludlow.
- Ah, you mean Mr. Ludlum.

01:05:54.964 --> 01:05:57.728
- You'll find him
in his office up there, gov.
- Thank you.

01:06:06.809 --> 01:06:08.970
- Mr. Ludlum?
- Yes, sir.

01:06:09.045 --> 01:06:11.775
I understand you have
a little old airplane for sale.

01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:14.611
- I'm Ross. I called you this morning.
- Ah, yes, sir. Yes.

01:06:14.684 --> 01:06:17.676
- You'd like to take
a little look, would you?
- Yeah, please.

01:06:18.788 --> 01:06:21.222
She's a Stampe, sir.

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:24.282
Oh, the Belgian version
of the old Tiger Moth.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.193
- Yes, indeed.
You know your aircraft, sir.
- Mm.

01:06:27.263 --> 01:06:30.357
She trained a lot of good
fighter pilots in her day.

01:06:30.433 --> 01:06:33.960
- How many hours on the engine?
- A hundred and eighteen
since the last overhaul.

01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:37.335
- A hundred and eighty? -
Eighteen, sir. One-eight.

01:06:37.406 --> 01:06:41.240
- She's generally
in very good shape.
- How much are you asking?

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:44.370
Well, you'll need
to have a look at the logs
and certifications, won't you?

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:48.383
- So let's nip back to the office
and see what we can do.
- Okay.

01:06:55.358 --> 01:06:59.658
Look at Yaskov.
He must have seen
<i>Casablanca</i> 12 times.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.491
You better wait here.

01:07:13.376 --> 01:07:16.368
- I know where he is.
- Who's that, comrade?

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:20.811
May I suggest we pool
our information?

01:07:20.883 --> 01:07:25.445
If I tell you the city,
you will know how to find him
in that city, yes?

01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:31.016
- A new wrinkle on détente.
- That manuscript is
an embarrassment to us all.

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:35.029
If you catch him, your people
will squeeze him. We're not
crazy about that idea.

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:38.032
At the moment, we feel it is more
important he be neutralized.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.264
He knows too much about
our side, as well as yours.

01:07:42.338 --> 01:07:44.738
Well?

01:07:44.807 --> 01:07:46.741
Sorry.

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:49.369
Very well.
He is back in London.

01:07:51.747 --> 01:07:54.079
He flew there from Bermuda
two days ago.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:59.315
- He's traveling under the name
of L eonard Ross.
- That figures.

01:07:59.388 --> 01:08:02.653
I'd like to be able to tell you
that we found him through
brilliant detective work.

01:08:02.725 --> 01:08:08.493
But in actual fact,
one of my men just happened
to recognize him at Heathrow.

01:08:08.564 --> 01:08:12.227
I will want a quid pro quo
one day, my good friend.

01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:14.428
I bet you will.

01:08:14.503 --> 01:08:16.493
See you in London.

01:08:19.675 --> 01:08:21.609
- Well?
- He's in London.

01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:25.670
- He gave you that for free?
- Of course not. Nothing's
free with that old fox.

01:08:25.747 --> 01:08:28.308
But it does tell us one thing.

01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:31.376
- The Russians are
just as nervous as we are.
- You're learning.

01:08:31.453 --> 01:08:34.582
By the way, he's traveling
on your passport.

01:08:46.035 --> 01:08:49.095
<i>- [Chattering]</i>
- That's cheaper too.

01:08:51.774 --> 01:08:55.573
[Speaking German]

01:08:55.644 --> 01:08:58.511
Uh, no, I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:02.346
<i>- Parlez-vous Francais, monsieur?</i>
- No, no. This...

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:04.648
Can you speak French
or German, either of you?

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:07.279
Does Alfie Booker
still work here?

01:09:08.957 --> 01:09:12.519
- Yeah. He's out in the back.
- May I speak to him
for a moment, please?

01:09:12.595 --> 01:09:15.086
- Sure. Help yourself
- Thank you.

01:09:17.133 --> 01:09:20.432
- Here, I'll take this one myself
- Yeah, I like that one.

01:09:25.608 --> 01:09:28.441
Alfred P. Booker.
[Laughs]

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:32.002
Mr. Kendig. Hey, it's good to see you.
It's been two years.

01:09:32.081 --> 01:09:34.015
- You lost a little weight, didn't you?
- Yeah.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:37.883
- Hey, how'd that
transistor job go for you?
- The transistor?

01:09:37.953 --> 01:09:42.412
What... Oh, they never
even knew it was there.
Not a clue.

01:09:42.491 --> 01:09:44.959
I have something a little more
difficult for you this time.

01:09:45.027 --> 01:09:47.188
May I come
around here, please?

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:54.135
Tell me how practical
you think that is.

01:09:57.239 --> 01:09:59.400
[Laughing]

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:04.102
- Where are we staying?
- The Hilton.
- Good.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:07.081
And I set up a meeting
for this afternoon
with British Intelligence.

01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:09.515
Yeah, well, there's no problem
with the electronic stuff.

01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:13.180
That's dead easy.
But it's the mechanics
I'm not sure about.

01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:17.885
Servo motors, some sort
of hydraulic transfer.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.157
Look, there is a chap
I know in the navy, used
to know all about this stuff.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:24.358
Do you want me
to get ahold of him
and see if he can help us?

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:27.402
- How low do you think
it will take?
- Give me a ring tonight.

01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:29.699
I'll know by then if I can get
ahold of him. And if I can...

01:10:29.772 --> 01:10:33.139
I'll go down to the field
tomorrow morning.

01:10:33.209 --> 01:10:35.677
Could have it installed for you
by nightfall. How's that sound?

01:10:35.744 --> 01:10:40.181
All right, I'll call you.
Just give me your home
phone number, if you please.

01:10:40.249 --> 01:10:42.240
Yeah.

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:49.417
<i>You understand, Sir Giles,</i>
<i>this requires a certain</i>
<i>delicacy on all our parts.</i>

01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:52.654
<i>Yes, I'm sure it must be terribly</i>
<i>embarrassing for all of you.</i>

01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:57.131
Of course, we in England would
never allow ourselves to get into
such a ridiculous predicament.

01:10:57.199 --> 01:10:59.963
- You see, what we need is...
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.

01:11:00.035 --> 01:11:02.333
But it's quite fascinating,
isn't it? The part where...

01:11:02.404 --> 01:11:05.601
I think it's chapter three...
the bit about Somoza, Nicaragua.

01:11:05.674 --> 01:11:08.336
Your Kendig's got
quite a sense of humor.

01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:11.538
Sir Giles, we would appreciate it
if we could move forward with this.

01:11:11.614 --> 01:11:15.175
Technically,
it's not our problem, is it?
He's broken no laws in Britain.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:19.244
But, of course, hands
across the sea and all that.
We'll be happy to cooperate.

01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:22.848
<i>- Now, what exactly would</i>
<i>you like to have us do?</i>
<i>- [Cutter] Manpower.</i>

01:11:22.925 --> 01:11:25.155
We'd like you to put a lot
of people on the ports of exit...

01:11:25.227 --> 01:11:27.218
airlines, terminals, that stuff.

01:11:27.296 --> 01:11:32.427
Well, that does seem
to be rather fruitless. We don't
really know what he looks like.

01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:35.129
We do have this, sir.

01:11:35.204 --> 01:11:38.332
Ah. Thank you.
Which one is, uh...

01:11:38.407 --> 01:11:41.672
Well, that's Yaskov.
What's he doing with Yaskov?

01:11:41.744 --> 01:11:44.872
- That's part of our problem.
- The main thing is...

01:11:44.947 --> 01:11:46.881
I'll have a word with the police.

01:11:46.949 --> 01:11:49.782
- We'll circulate copies of this
to all ports of exit.
- The main thing is...

01:11:49.852 --> 01:11:53.288
he's come to England
for a reason; he didn't
pick it out of a hat.

01:11:53.355 --> 01:11:57.553
We think he's here to find
a publisher. There can only be
so many publishers in London.

01:11:57.626 --> 01:12:01.756
A dozen or so major houses.
Perhaps 30 or 40 small presses.

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:04.526
He wants to make a big noise,
so he'd go to a big house.

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.966
<i>But I think that's what</i>
<i>he'll think we're thinking...</i>

01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:08.901
so I think he'll
go to a small one.

01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:12.737
All right. I've got friends
in some of the publishing firms.

01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:15.174
I'll get in touch
and let you know what I learn.

01:12:15.244 --> 01:12:17.610
- Where are you staying?
- The Hilton.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.208
Yes, of course.
I'll ring the Hilton the instant
we've got anything of interest.

01:12:23.519 --> 01:12:25.612
Good-bye, Mr. Myerson.

01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:31.318
- Yes, can I help you?
- Can you call Salzburg,
Austria, for me, please?

01:12:33.162 --> 01:12:36.131
Yes, of course.
If you'd like to sit down...

01:12:36.198 --> 01:12:38.860
- I'll tell you as soon
as we get through.
- Thank you.

- The feathers in what?
- [Kendig] The Feathers Inn.

01:13:18.807 --> 01:13:21.241
The Feathers Inn.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:25.110
- Don't you remember, darling?
- Of course I remember, darling.

some lunch. I'll take over.

01:13:35.958 --> 01:13:37.949
All right. Thanks.

01:13:52.941 --> 01:13:55.933
Ah, Mr. Follett. Come in.

being watched 24 hours a day...

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:24.434
and feel that you and I
could come to some more
civilized arraignment.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:29.136
And B... I have just been
speaking on the telephone
with Kendig.

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:31.441
- Where was he calling from?
- He didn't say.

01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:35.347
He did say, however, he feels
that this has now become
a ridiculous charade...

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:37.385
that we should all stop playing.

01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:39.944
We'd be delighted
to stop playing.

01:14:40.022 --> 01:14:42.582
- Would you like a drink?
- Thank you.

01:14:42.658 --> 01:14:44.592
A little whiskey maybe.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:49.222
Good. Kendig would
like to speak to you...

01:14:49.298 --> 01:14:52.699
because he's too emotionally
involved with the others.

01:14:52.768 --> 01:14:55.236
He said he would telephone
about 1:30, which is...

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:59.900
<i>Oh, in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>I said I felt sure you would</i>
<i>be here to take the call.</i>

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:03.433
[Gasps]
No ice. Excuse me.

01:15:03.512 --> 01:15:06.879
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>
<i>That's, uh, uh, fine.</i>

01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:11.613
Oh, please.
An American without ice
in his drink is unthinkable...

01:15:11.687 --> 01:15:14.315
if hot unconstitutional.

<i>Good boy.</i>

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.266

01:16:10.112 --> 01:16:13.377
Stay. Stay.

Good boy.

<i>- [Barking Continues]</i>
- Stupid animal.

01:16:26.795 --> 01:16:30.253
It's absolutely dynamite.

01:16:30.332 --> 01:16:32.596
It could be our biggest
book of the year.

01:16:34.703 --> 01:16:38.764
Although, uh, I still want to
see the last chapter, of course.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:43.072
I happen to have it
right in my pocket.
Finished it this morning.

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:48.082
- Splendid. I'm sure
I shan't be disappointed.
- Cheers.

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:50.175
Cheers.

01:16:55.057 --> 01:16:58.049
Mr. Westlake, you probably
won't see me again.

01:16:58.126 --> 01:17:01.289
I've given someone
a power of attorney...

01:17:01.363 --> 01:17:04.821
to get in touch with you
regarding contracts and payments.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:10.031
Under the circumstances,
your absence will probably be
our best publicity.

01:17:10.105 --> 01:17:12.903
You're at considerable risk,
aren't you?

01:17:12.975 --> 01:17:16.570
Well, if you publish this,
you're going to be taking
a risk yourself

01:17:16.645 --> 01:17:21.105
We've dealt with
controversy before.
The spice of life.

01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:26.382
These fellows don't play
by the Marquis of Queen...
It-It is Marquis?

01:17:26.455 --> 01:17:29.424
- Yes, Marquis.
- Marquis of Queensbury rules,
you know.

01:17:29.491 --> 01:17:32.358
Well, I certainly hope not.
Not half so much fun.

01:17:43.138 --> 01:17:45.129
You wait here.

01:17:53.515 --> 01:17:56.348
[No Audible Dialogue]

01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:06.527
Mr. Westlake, I'm terribly sorry.
These gentlemen...

01:18:06.595 --> 01:18:08.654
- It's about
the Kendig manuscript.
- That's all right.

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:11.164
- I've been looking
forward to this.
- Good.

01:18:11.233 --> 01:18:15.465
Glad you're not gonna try
one of those l-don't-know-what-
you're-talking-about stories.

01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:17.903
My name is Parker Westlake.

01:18:17.973 --> 01:18:20.441
- The point is...
- What's yours?

01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:23.137
- What?
- What are your names?

01:18:24.313 --> 01:18:26.247
Smith and Jones.

01:18:26.315 --> 01:18:30.012
From my reading of the manuscript,
you have to be Myerson.

01:18:30.085 --> 01:18:33.680
Are you Joe Cutter, by any chance?
I'm glad to meet you.

01:18:33.755 --> 01:18:37.953
Now, please,
why don't we sit down
and reason this thing together?

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:41.587
Why don't you give us
the manuscript?
You can't publish it.

01:18:41.663 --> 01:18:43.961
I think you're wrong about that.

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:50.697
Tell him, Joe.

01:18:50.772 --> 01:18:53.332
I'm afraid he's right.

01:18:53.408 --> 01:18:57.708
I don't like to make threats.
They sound foolish in the daylight.

01:18:57.779 --> 01:19:00.805
But I am to infer that if I
don't give you the manuscript...

01:19:00.882 --> 01:19:03.373
you'll creep in here
one dark night and take it.

01:19:03.452 --> 01:19:06.853
<i>Or is it more along</i>
<i>the lines of, uh...</i>

01:19:06.922 --> 01:19:11.291

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.555
You said it, we didn't.

01:19:13.628 --> 01:19:16.188
Gentlemen, let me
tell you something.

01:19:16.264 --> 01:19:20.394
I think this is one of the most
exciting literary properties
I've seen in a long time.

01:19:20.469 --> 01:19:23.029
It simply isn't possible
for you to suppress it.

01:19:23.105 --> 01:19:26.871
Let me caution you.
I've run off copies
of the manuscript...

01:19:26.942 --> 01:19:28.876
and had them put
in safe places.

01:19:28.944 --> 01:19:33.108
<i>So even if I suffer</i>
<i>an unfortunate accident...</i>

01:19:33.181 --> 01:19:35.979
<i>the process of publication</i>
<i>will continue.</i>

01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:39.714
Naturally, we don't intend to
use our usual printing house.

01:19:39.788 --> 01:19:42.052
So no one will know
where the book is...

01:19:42.124 --> 01:19:45.924
<i>until it's far too late to stop</i>
<i>its distribution to the bookshops.</i>

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:49.054
I think your friend Kendig...

01:19:49.131 --> 01:19:52.396
has you well and truly
by the short hairs.

01:19:55.570 --> 01:19:58.232
If you publish that book, you're
signing his death warrant.

01:19:58.306 --> 01:20:01.070
There's only one man who can stop
the publication of that book...

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:03.270
and that's Kendig himself

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:05.438
Why don't you
talk to him about it?

01:20:12.354 --> 01:20:16.450
- We can't find the bastard.
- Find him? My dear fellow,
where's the difficulty in that?

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:19.756
He's staying right here in London
at the Windsor Hotel.

01:20:19.828 --> 01:20:22.763
- What?
- The Windsor Hotel
in Landcaster Gate...

01:20:22.831 --> 01:20:25.061
just north of the park.

01:20:27.068 --> 01:20:29.059
Thank you.

Room 416. Apparently,
he's expecting us.

01:21:03.638 --> 01:21:06.072
We'll take the stairs.

01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:11.007
- How'd you get here?
- He telephoned my embassy.

01:21:11.079 --> 01:21:13.809
- He's very democratic, isn't he?
- Yes, isn't he?

01:21:13.882 --> 01:21:17.943
I do like him, you know.
One can't help it.

01:21:37.339 --> 01:21:39.432
Come on.
He's not gonna shoot you.

01:21:40.475 --> 01:21:42.466

Close the door.

01:22:42.737 --> 01:22:44.830

Hello, boys.

<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

01:22:52.113 --> 01:22:54.809
<i>Why don't you sit down?</i>
<i>Make yourselves comfortable.</i>

01:22:54.883 --> 01:22:58.046
Joe, give everyone
a drink, will ya?

01:22:58.119 --> 01:23:00.679
Whiskey is right there
next to the tape recorder...

01:23:00.755 --> 01:23:04.156
and there's some ice,
if it hasn't melted by this time.

01:23:04.225 --> 01:23:08.127
Sorry there's no vodka, Yaskov.
I simply forgot it.

01:23:08.196 --> 01:23:12.656
- Myerson, couldn't find
any bourbon and coke.
- [Chuckles]

01:23:12.734 --> 01:23:15.396
I suppose you're
wondering where I am.

01:23:16.871 --> 01:23:19.169
Well, we know I'm not
about to try the airports...

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.038
the boat-trains
and the liners in Southampton...

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:25.773
the trains to Scotland
and the ferryboats to Ireland.

01:23:25.847 --> 01:23:28.714
Did you think of Ireland, Joe,
or did you slip up on that one?

01:23:28.783 --> 01:23:30.842
We thought of it.

01:23:30.919 --> 01:23:34.980
[Kendig Resumes]
Well, I'll give you a clue
as to my whereabouts later on.

01:23:35.056 --> 01:23:38.651
<i>In the meanwhile,</i>
<i>the reason I asked you all</i>
<i>to come up here...</i>

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:42.891

<i>a copy of my last chapter.</i>

01:23:42.964 --> 01:23:46.297
<i>It's sitting on top</i>
<i>of the chest of drawers...</i>

01:23:46.368 --> 01:23:49.303
<i>right next to the recorder.</i>

01:23:49.371 --> 01:23:51.430
That's all. Why don't you
take it home and read it?

01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:53.770
Enjoy yourselves.
Have a good time.

01:23:53.842 --> 01:23:57.243

01:24:17.198 --> 01:24:19.291
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:24:23.304 --> 01:24:25.431
- Good night, Joe.
- Yep.

01:25:14.823 --> 01:25:18.088
Good grief, Joe,
you look terrible.

01:25:18.159 --> 01:25:21.424
Well, you've been
keeping me up past
my regular bedtime.

01:25:21.496 --> 01:25:24.659
- Mm. Chair, please.
- [Snap]

01:25:26.701 --> 01:25:30.967
- Myerson thrown in the towel yet?
- He wants to see you dead.

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:35.408
Oh, it doesn't make
any difference whether
I'm dead or alive, Joe.

01:25:35.477 --> 01:25:37.707
He's all washed up now.
Doesn't he know that?

01:25:37.779 --> 01:25:41.374
Lean forward, please.
Hands behind your back.

01:25:41.449 --> 01:25:43.815
- How come he hasn't quit yet?
- He's a little bit like you.

01:25:43.885 --> 01:25:48.322
- He won't quit
until he gets even.
- Should be even by now.

01:25:48.389 --> 01:25:51.756
He tried to emasculate me,
and I retaliated.

01:25:53.328 --> 01:25:55.558
- What's your game plan now?
- There isn't any. The game's over.

01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:57.928
It's all finished.
I've had my fun.

01:25:57.999 --> 01:26:01.162
- It's too late for that.
I've got my orders.
- Ahh.

01:26:01.236 --> 01:26:06.173
I understand, Joe.
You'll never see me
again after tonight.

01:26:06.241 --> 01:26:08.232
- I'll find ya.
- No.

01:26:08.309 --> 01:26:10.470
Did you pick up
my last, uh, chapter?

01:26:10.545 --> 01:26:12.945
Yes, I did. And I think
you went a little bit too far.

01:26:13.014 --> 01:26:16.415
- Oh, I don't think so.
- You know, I don't understand you.

01:26:16.484 --> 01:26:18.782
It's not like you to paint
yourself into a corner.

01:26:18.853 --> 01:26:21.253
But I don't see where
you've got any back door.

01:26:21.322 --> 01:26:24.223
- You're my back door, Joe.
- I can't do you any favors.

01:26:24.292 --> 01:26:27.591
- Sure you can.
You already did.
- I did?

01:26:27.662 --> 01:26:30.927
You know I'd never use this.
You didn't do anything about it.

01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:34.897
I'm gonna have to put
a gag in your mouth, Joe.

01:26:34.969 --> 01:26:37.802
The cleaning lady will
turn you loose in the morning.

01:26:37.872 --> 01:26:41.171
- [Sighs] I hope she's pretty.
- Open your mouth.

01:27:00.161 --> 01:27:04.928
Oh, uh, you can call
your crowd off the airport.

Joe Cutter is tied to a chair
in his room.

01:28:26.247 --> 01:28:28.772

Hello, Is? Did you make it?

01:28:58.146 --> 01:29:00.444
No. No, I didn't make it.

01:29:00.515 --> 01:29:04.042
This is a recording of
a person asleep. How are you?

01:29:04.118 --> 01:29:08.214
Right on schedule.
As of how, the clock is running.

01:29:08.289 --> 01:29:11.781
- Well, where is it running?
- The Pond Gemington.

01:29:11.859 --> 01:29:13.793
The Pond where?

01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:16.728
The Pond, near that
beautiful graveyard.

01:29:16.798 --> 01:29:19.460
You know, the one
with the Norman church.

01:29:19.534 --> 01:29:24.062
And all those cold stones.
Yes, yes, I remember.
I'll see you there in an hour.

01:29:27.108 --> 01:29:29.099
[Sighs]

01:29:38.152 --> 01:29:40.143
Damn it!

01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:02.300
Police. Thank God.

01:30:02.377 --> 01:30:05.039
You fellas are never
supposed to be around
when you're needed.

01:30:05.113 --> 01:30:08.571
- Having a spot of trouble, sir?
- Yeah. I got a flat tire there.

01:30:08.649 --> 01:30:11.709
I just made a telephone call,
came back, tire was flat...

01:30:11.786 --> 01:30:14.414
- and there's no spare in there.
- Your car, sir?

01:30:14.489 --> 01:30:18.186
- No, it's a rental.
- Well, that's where
the spare should be, sir.

01:30:18.259 --> 01:30:20.784
Yeah, but it's not there.

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:25.263
Listen, superspy,
I wouldn't tell Myerson
about this if I were you.

01:30:25.333 --> 01:30:28.825
- [Muffled] Fuck, Myerson.
- Oh, by the way,
did he get your passport?

01:30:31.205 --> 01:30:34.732
- Where you from
in America, sir?
<i>- Flagstaff, Arizona.</i>

01:30:34.809 --> 01:30:38.438
Hey, is there a place
around here I can rent a car?
I got to get to Eastbourne.

01:30:38.513 --> 01:30:41.175
<i>Well, it might be a bit</i>
<i>difiicult at this time</i>
<i>of the morning, sir.</i>

01:30:41.249 --> 01:30:44.810
Why don't you come back
to the station and wait for
one of the garages to open?

01:30:44.886 --> 01:30:47.013
<i>We'll make you</i>
<i>a nice cup of coffee.</i>

01:30:49.223 --> 01:30:54.786
We'll be at the Lambath heliport
in 15 or 20 minutes. Right.

01:30:54.862 --> 01:30:57.228
If he doesn't take off
before daylight,
we might just catch him.

01:30:57.298 --> 01:30:59.994
- What time is daylight?
- About 7:00. It's 6:15 now.

01:31:00.068 --> 01:31:02.559
- Is a cab waiting for us downstairs?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:34.469 --> 01:31:37.802
- Now I want to know...
- I owe him one.

01:31:37.872 --> 01:31:40.534
This is the quid pro quo, right?

01:31:48.382 --> 01:31:50.316
I'm in a little bit
of a hurry, sir.

01:31:50.384 --> 01:31:52.944
Um, is there any chance of
getting an all-night taxi service...

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.251
from Brighton or Seaford
or one of those places?

01:31:56.324 --> 01:32:00.727
Here, Sarge, didn't
old Tony Cosgrove used to
run some sort of taxi service?

01:32:00.795 --> 01:32:04.231
- Yeah. If he's still alive.
- He's still alive, all right.

01:32:04.298 --> 01:32:07.290
Give him a go, Harry.
We'll have you away
in no time, sir.

01:32:07.368 --> 01:32:09.700
<i>[Kendig] Thank you very much.</i>
<i>Sure appreciate it.</i>

01:32:11.172 --> 01:32:13.606
<i>[Man] Now, let's see.</i>
<i>Tony Cosgrove.</i>

01:32:27.021 --> 01:32:29.046
This time we'll
get there before him.

01:32:29.123 --> 01:32:31.785
He'll never expect us
to get a copter up.

01:32:31.859 --> 01:32:35.852
- You could be right.
- You bet your fucking ass I'm right.

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:42.228
<i>[Man] Straight along the A-20.</i>
<i>How long do you think you'll be?</i>

01:32:42.303 --> 01:32:44.931
<i>- [Man On Phone]</i>
<i>Oh, about half an hour.</i>
- It'll be about 30 minutes, sir.

01:32:45.006 --> 01:32:47.497
Excuse me, sir, but what
did you say your name was?

01:32:47.575 --> 01:32:51.671
- Burton. Henry Burton.
- Oh, yes, that's right.
Thank you, sir.

01:32:51.746 --> 01:32:54.374
I wonder if you could
show me some means
of identification?

01:32:54.448 --> 01:33:00.216
- Sure. You want a passport?
Driver's license?
- Either, sir.

01:33:02.123 --> 01:33:04.114
- There.
- Thank you.

01:33:10.298 --> 01:33:13.233
[Chuckles] You do rather look
a bit like this chap, sir.

01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:16.327
But I'm sure it had
nothing to do with you.
Just a coincidence, eh?

01:33:17.538 --> 01:33:19.472
We've had a bulletin, you see.

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:22.475
An American that
you rather resemble
is wanted for questioning.

01:33:24.712 --> 01:33:26.703
Hmm.

01:33:26.781 --> 01:33:29.909
Well, I guess I look like
everybody and his brother.

01:33:29.984 --> 01:33:33.647
What has this, uh...
What is this fellow wanted for?

01:33:33.721 --> 01:33:37.919
Oh, nothing in particular.
Just some people would like
to ask him a few questions.

01:33:39.193 --> 01:33:41.753
Oh, what the hell's going on
here with the lights?

01:33:41.829 --> 01:33:44.263
[Shouting, Indistinct]

01:34:45.393 --> 01:34:49.386
- Oh, hi, there.
- Morning. When did you
join the police force?

01:34:49.463 --> 01:34:52.796
- It's the only car I could find
that had any gas in it.
- Good thinking.

01:34:52.867 --> 01:34:55.995
Listen, no matter what happens,
you stay put right here.

01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:58.504
- I'll be back
within an hour, okay?
- Okay.

01:34:58.572 --> 01:35:02.906
And if you're not back within
the hour, I'll wait for another
hour and another and another...

They say he was murdered
by his own men, the C.I.A.

Do you think there's
any truth in that?

01:41:33.667 --> 01:41:37.967
There are those who say he's
still alive, living in Australia.

Oh, is that a fact...
