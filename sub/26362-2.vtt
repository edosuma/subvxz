When you hear a baby screaming
its tripe out, of course.

"Oh, I love the sound of that."
It's a racket. So of course.

"Shut the fuck up."
But this time it slipped out.

brought this reaction on?

of it happening.

Yeah, if you're looking at it that
way. Why have we got on to that now?

07:52.340 --> 07:56.020
I thought this was about telling
a baby to, "Shut the fuck up."

07:56.180 --> 07:58.540
I don't want a baby.
Is that a bad thing to say?

are when you talk about babies.

Look, I...

08:22.340 --> 08:27.020
The reason I split up with
my ex-girlfriend Zoe is because
she started going down this road,

08:27.180 --> 08:30.020
started going on about having kids.
I never wanted it.

08:30.180 --> 08:34.659
That isn't why I went out with her.
It wasn't what I wanted in life.

to join us together.

08:42.780 --> 08:47.420
Her friends started having kids.
"Why aren't we having kids?
It's what we're here for."

08:47.580 --> 08:51.820
"If we can have kids, we should have
them cos there's people who can't."

but I'm not gonna take up juggling.

What are you talking about?

13:47.610 --> 13:50.410
It's not real. It's a training baby.

13:50.570 --> 13:54.290
Lesley was learning to be a nanny
but it wasn't for her.

13:54.450 --> 13:58.610
It's been a toy that's been keeping
me awake all week. It's not a toy.

13:58.810 --> 14:03.090
(TOY DOLL CRIES) I know why she's
exhausted. I've had it for an hour
and I am worn out.

14:03.290 --> 14:07.010
Where is the volume control
or the on-and-off button?
There isn't any.

14:07.210 --> 14:11.770
The only way to stop it from crying
is to feed it, burp it
and change its shitty nappies.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.930
Would you take it out?
I'm getting a migraine.

14:15.090 --> 14:18.690
She's had a bit of time off. I'll
take it back to her. She's not there.

14:18.850 --> 14:23.290
Why? Well, she told me she went
to The Arches with her friends.

14:23.490 --> 14:29.130
She's gone clubbing? That's what she
thinks she can do when she's meant
to be looking after someone's kid?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.130
She is one cheeky cow!

14:35.450 --> 14:38.650
(TOY BABY CRIES)

14:38.810 --> 14:41.930
I don't need this.
I'm supposed to be having a jostle.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.050
What are you doing?

14:51.170 --> 14:53.050
(TOY BABY CRIES)

14:54.890 --> 14:57.530
Wind it. It might need winding.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.930
(TOY BABY CRIES)

15:01.010 --> 15:05.370
What's wrong with the little shit?
Swearing in front of a baby again.

15:06.890 --> 15:10.050
Swearing should be the first thing
you teach a baby.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.010
It'd probably cry less
if it knew how to swear.

15:13.210 --> 15:17.770
I'd much prefer to hear a baby say,
"I need fucking winding.
I need fucking feeding."

15:17.890 --> 15:20.370
"Oh, shit, I've shat myself again."

15:20.490 --> 15:22.570
(TOY BABY WHIMPERS SOFTLY)

15:32.490 --> 15:34.890
(PEOPLE CHATTERING) >

15:44.290 --> 15:46.610
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:46.770 --> 15:49.610
Can you just make a bit of gap
to get through.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.490
Sorry. Cheers.

15:52.650 --> 15:55.290
Cheers.
Is that a baby? No way!

15:55.410 --> 15:57.130
Excuse me, mate.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.010
Excuse me. Can you move over a bit?

16:01.290 --> 16:03.770
Have you got room for two more in?

16:05.290 --> 16:06.890
Sorry, it's underage.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.050
I just want to get it back
to its owner.

16:10.210 --> 16:13.090
You're wearing jeans and trainers.
They're not allowed.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.450
What's wrong with jeans and trainers?
Next!

16:16.690 --> 16:20.930
What's wrong with jeans and trainers?
He's wearing a fucking bin-bag!

16:25.250 --> 16:27.530
(TOY BABY CRIES)

16:27.650 --> 16:30.650
What's wrong now? Shh-shh-shh.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.530
(SIGHS) I haven't got time for this.

16:48.290 --> 16:50.010
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

16:53.050 --> 16:55.410
What's wrong with you, eh?

16:55.530 --> 16:57.410
What is it now?

16:57.530 --> 16:59.090
Stop here.

16:59.250 --> 17:02.450
I think it's a faulty one.
No real baby cries this much.

17:03.530 --> 17:06.930
Depressed. You've got a depressed
one, a bipolar one.

17:07.130 --> 17:12.569
You've winded it. It doesn't need
winding. It needs fucking
counselling. It's mental.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.930
Quietening down a bit.
Is that what it was?

17:20.050 --> 17:23.010
All right, happy?

17:23.170 --> 17:26.530
Yeah? That's happy. You're happy.
Let's go find its mam.

17:26.650 --> 17:28.690
Come on, Super Nanny.

17:32.730 --> 17:34.330
(DANCE MUSIC)

17:48.130 --> 17:49.850
What are you doing here?

17:55.530 --> 17:57.170
Is that her over there?

18:04.890 --> 18:07.010
Are you Lesley?

18:07.130 --> 18:08.410
Yeah!

18:10.050 --> 18:14.450
Who are you?
Your fucking babysitter!

18:14.610 --> 18:18.410
You left it with my auntie.
What are you playing at? Over there.

18:25.050 --> 18:28.890
Dealing with a screaming baby
is a lot easier if it's your own.

18:29.050 --> 18:32.650
I just can't imagine being a nanny
now. Well, that's fine but -

18:32.850 --> 18:37.530
Can you just take it home? No.
Please! No chance. The agency
is going to pick it up tomorrow.

18:37.730 --> 18:42.170
You can give it to them, then.
I'm not gonna pull anyone
carrying that thing around.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.810
Just -
Come on, let's go for another drink.

18:44.930 --> 18:46.930
Whoo!

18:47.090 --> 18:49.370
Hey.
Have you got your sperm test kit?

18:52.490 --> 18:54.410
It's empty in here.

19:08.890 --> 19:10.490
Sit there.

19:15.290 --> 19:18.690
You need it all in the pot.
Don't spill it.

19:35.610 --> 19:37.570
What's taking you so long? Just...

19:38.810 --> 19:40.930
Go a bit faster with it.

19:41.050 --> 19:42.770
I'm trying my best here.

19:42.930 --> 19:45.930
You're not stroking a cat.
(TOY BABY CRIES)

19:49.890 --> 19:52.810
Probably needs winding again.
Can't you wind it?

19:52.930 --> 19:54.930
Got your hands full, haven't you?

19:55.090 --> 19:57.450
(TOY BABY CRIES)
Just try and ignore it.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.890
(OPERATIC MUSIC)

20:38.890 --> 20:40.770
(EXHALES)

20:41.810 --> 20:44.090
Done it.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.490
Good one.

20:47.570 --> 20:50.170
I feel dizzy.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.970
It wasn't hard, was it?

20:59.690 --> 21:01.410
Job done.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.530
All right?
Yeah. You?

21:10.930 --> 21:14.090
I'll tell you what,
I'm glad to be out of there.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.330
Prefer the sound of a baby crying
to that racket.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.650
How's that fun?

21:23.170 --> 21:25.490
You're a bit quiet.

21:25.650 --> 21:28.410
I'm not surprised
after what that's seen.

21:28.570 --> 21:31.210
It takes five minutes
to get the result.

21:32.370 --> 21:36.290
It says here if you lined up every
sperm from a single ejaculation,

21:36.450 --> 21:39.490
it'd make a queue
that would be six miles long.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.170
Jesus!

21:42.330 --> 21:45.490
It was hard enough herding them
from your bollocks to the pot

21:45.650 --> 21:50.010
without trying to get them to stand
in a queue. (TOY BABY CRIES)

21:50.170 --> 21:55.050
I recognise that cry. It means
you want winding, doesn't it?

21:59.130 --> 22:01.370
(TOY BABY WHIMPERS SOFTLY)
That's it.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.410
It's been an experience, hasn't it?

22:09.530 --> 22:11.290
Yeah, it has, hasn't it?

22:12.370 --> 22:15.610
Surprise me a bit. I didn't think
you had what it takes.

22:22.490 --> 22:24.130
It doesn't look like I do.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.530
Oh, well, it doesn't matter anyway,
does it?

22:33.650 --> 22:35.450
You didn't want a baby, did you?

22:35.650 --> 22:39.650
At the end of the day,
nothing but hassle and headache.
Let's get going.

22:39.810 --> 22:43.290
Mind you,
it's only 99 percent accurate.

22:45.690 --> 22:47.650
There's still a one-percent chance.
