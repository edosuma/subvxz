WEBVTT

01:20.379 --> 01:21.848
Uh...

01:36.228 --> 01:37.797
Oh, I have to finish
all this before...

01:39.665 --> 01:41.934
Go and steam
the tablecloths for tonight.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.337
I'm going to paint over that
water stain in the ceiling.

01:47.072 --> 01:48.141
Huh!

01:53.979 --> 01:56.783
Huh? Oh.

01:59.518 --> 02:00.753
Like, this afternoon?

02:00.786 --> 02:02.521
- Five minutes!
- What?

02:07.259 --> 02:09.596
Which paint did you use?

02:50.569 --> 02:53.173
Joy is here? Go set the table.
He must be hungry.

02:56.675 --> 02:58.611
We talk later?

03:25.938 --> 03:27.640
Hey, hey!

03:28.774 --> 03:30.777
Thank you for doing this.

03:31.577 --> 03:33.379
You look really pretty
right now.

03:33.412 --> 03:35.214
Oh, you like this...

03:35.247 --> 03:37.083
this hot Mormon look?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.419
I'm just telling you now
in case my mom says

03:40.452 --> 03:44.090
something dumb
like you're fat or whatever.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.491
I thought you said when she says

03:45.524 --> 03:47.260
shit like that,
it means she cares.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.096
Hi, Evelyn.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.430
- Mrs Wang!
- Hey, Mom.

03:51.463 --> 03:53.633
I only cook enough food
for three people.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.568
Now I have to cook more.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.174
It's Joy. She brought Becky.

04:10.182 --> 04:12.385
- Hi!
- Hi, honey!

04:12.418 --> 04:14.520
Hi, Mr Wang!

04:14.553 --> 04:17.356
Hi, Becky! Thank you for coming.

04:17.389 --> 04:19.725
Please call me Waymond.
Here, sit.

04:19.758 --> 04:22.595
You know,
he doesn't have to stay.

04:22.628 --> 04:23.929
Who's he?

04:23.962 --> 04:25.398
- Becky.
- Becky's a she.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.099
You know me.

04:27.132 --> 04:28.668
I always mix up 'he', 'she'.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.337
In Chinese,
just one word - 'ta' - so easy.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.838
And the way you two are dressed,

04:32.871 --> 04:34.740
I'm sure I'm not the only one
calling him 'he'.

04:34.773 --> 04:36.609
I mean her 'him'. Ugh!

04:36.642 --> 04:39.879
Anyways, my English is fine
and we have Google.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.014
So you don't have to come
and be a translator.

04:42.047 --> 04:43.616
You stay here.

04:43.649 --> 04:44.884
And she can go.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.686
Look, I honestly
think it's weird, OK?

04:46.719 --> 04:49.355
But Becky wants to help.
Right, Becky?

04:49.388 --> 04:52.391
I always learn something when
I hang out with the elderly.

04:52.424 --> 04:54.393
Old people are very wise.

04:54.426 --> 04:55.828
Hmm. It's OK.

04:55.861 --> 04:57.863
We'll take Gong Gong
with us to the meeting.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.933
Uh, you and Becky stay here
and decorate. Hmm?

05:04.403 --> 05:06.305
Where is he?
When can I meet him?

05:08.574 --> 05:10.843
Huh! Customers.

05:10.876 --> 05:12.345
Eat fast.

05:18.183 --> 05:19.552
- Mom.
- What?

05:19.585 --> 05:20.886
Mom, just wait.

05:20.919 --> 05:22.655
Wait? Wait?
No time to wait today.

05:22.688 --> 05:23.989
Just please...

05:24.022 --> 05:27.026
Joy, any other time,
I beg you to come and eat

05:27.059 --> 05:29.795
or call me or anything,
but today very busy.

05:29.828 --> 05:31.506
Mom, this is literally
what it's always like.

05:31.530 --> 05:32.832
Wrong white paint!

05:32.865 --> 05:34.743
I know you haven't always
liked Becky, OK, but...

05:34.767 --> 05:37.103
I like Becky. She is very nice.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.372
You are very lucky...

05:44.576 --> 05:46.245
She's half Mexican.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.649
Ugh!

05:51.316 --> 05:53.152
- Huh!
- No shoes in washer.

05:53.185 --> 05:54.920
Broken, you pay, yeah?

05:54.953 --> 05:58.457
But Gong Gong,
his heart cannot take it,

05:58.490 --> 05:59.892
especially after
such a long flight.

05:59.925 --> 06:02.595
You want him to come all the way
from China to die like that?

06:02.628 --> 06:04.497
He's not gonna die.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.598
Ooh!

06:06.365 --> 06:08.734
- How can I help you?
- Just hold on. I can't hear you.

06:08.767 --> 06:10.403
- Just hold on.
- How can I help you?

06:10.436 --> 06:11.737
I'm here to pick up some shirts.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.515
- I called, like, three times.
- Give me your ticket.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.649
- Mmm-hmm, yeah.
- I find for you.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.008
- No, I have the ticket.
- Babe...

06:16.041 --> 06:17.652
She's just asking
for it 'cause that's, like,

06:17.676 --> 06:18.844
the way that it works.

06:18.877 --> 06:20.146
They don't read minds.

06:20.179 --> 06:23.149
Then hang up! Thank you.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.917
We've been together
for three years.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.353
Don't you think Gong Gong
would want to know?

06:27.386 --> 06:28.721
Let him enjoy his party tonight.

06:28.754 --> 06:30.689
Yeah, you think
Becky's gonna get through

06:30.722 --> 06:32.267
the whole party without
introducing herself...

06:32.291 --> 06:34.360
- Evelyn!
- Have you met Becky?

06:34.393 --> 06:37.697
Guess whose $20 got eaten
by the machine again.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.733
Waymond! Customers need you!

06:40.766 --> 06:42.134
Alright, coming!

06:42.167 --> 06:44.770
Evelyn, you know,
my wife used to wear

06:44.803 --> 06:47.072
that exact same perfume,
God rest her soul.

06:47.105 --> 06:48.841
Are you coming
to the party tonight?

06:48.874 --> 06:51.043
Yeah, I got my ticket
right here.

06:54.546 --> 06:57.616
Sorry. It was too crowded here
so I moved some upstairs.

06:57.649 --> 06:59.452
I think the clothes
are happier there.

07:06.458 --> 07:08.761
See? They're happier here.

07:14.733 --> 07:16.969
No more Google eyes!

07:17.002 --> 07:19.238
Mom, can we please
talk about Becky?

07:20.005 --> 07:21.783
I still don't know
what his brain is thinking.

07:21.807 --> 07:24.009
Can Becky come tonight or not?

07:24.042 --> 07:25.578
- Stop changing the subject.
- I'm not.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.213
You know, it's like our auditor.

07:27.246 --> 07:28.981
She is a terrible person.

07:29.014 --> 07:32.018
She keeps targeting
the Chinese in the community.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.454
You know, two years of meetings,

07:35.487 --> 07:37.456
she puts a lien
on our laundromat.

07:37.489 --> 07:38.891
And you know
what your father does?

07:38.924 --> 07:40.759
He brings her cookies.

07:44.463 --> 07:45.898
Every day I fight, I fight.

07:45.931 --> 07:47.933
I fight for all of us.

07:47.966 --> 07:51.203
Every day is a battle here.

07:51.236 --> 07:55.975
Oh, your father, he doesn't care
about the way things are...

07:59.011 --> 08:02.081
I try to make our lives
easier and more simple.

08:12.057 --> 08:13.392
You should have told me earlier.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.027
That's really impressive.

08:15.060 --> 08:16.829
Evelyn, you have
to see Rick dance.

08:16.862 --> 08:19.231
Look, he knows all of the moves.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.701
Becky, I'll fucking kill myself.

08:24.169 --> 08:26.038
He wants to be an actor,
just like you did.

08:30.108 --> 08:33.379
♪ Just put your hand

08:33.412 --> 08:35.014
♪ In my hand... ♪

08:36.615 --> 08:41.720
♪ And we'll spin
through eternity

08:41.753 --> 08:44.823
♪ Life can be so delicious

08:44.856 --> 08:46.025
♪ Delicious... ♪

08:50.462 --> 08:54.233
Ah! I love this!

08:54.266 --> 08:56.035
- Hey!
- Rick, you're so terrific.

08:56.935 --> 08:58.170
I know. I just...

08:58.203 --> 09:00.081
I just don't know how to be
any fucking clearer.

09:00.105 --> 09:01.173
It's like she can choose -

09:01.206 --> 09:02.775
either you come
to the party with me

09:02.808 --> 09:04.209
and Gong Gong
is eternally ashamed

09:04.242 --> 09:06.011
until he forgets it all
and then he dies

09:06.044 --> 09:08.414
or you don't come with me
and then he still dies.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.383
What? Huh!

09:11.216 --> 09:13.752
- What are you saying?
- That was a joke.

09:13.785 --> 09:16.889
Uh, that's not
a very funny joke, honey.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.357
- Hey, guys...
- This is only $10.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.259
I thought you people
were very good with math.

09:20.292 --> 09:21.869
- Next time I give you interest.
- Evelyn?

09:21.893 --> 09:23.028
Mom, Mom...

09:23.061 --> 09:25.264
- Mom! Mom!
- What?!

09:26.231 --> 09:27.466
Huh!

09:33.905 --> 09:36.008
Waymond! Waymond!

09:39.745 --> 09:41.480
Huh?

09:42.447 --> 09:44.083
Oh!

09:45.183 --> 09:46.419
Uh...

09:50.188 --> 09:53.059
Uh...

09:56.161 --> 09:58.197
Uh...

10:03.535 --> 10:06.472
Shit, how do you say it? Uh...

10:07.739 --> 10:09.075
Oh!

10:12.210 --> 10:13.210
Mom...

10:14.913 --> 10:16.982
You know what?
I'm actually not doing that.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.919
It's like
at this point I do not...

10:24.756 --> 10:26.392
It was nice to meet you!

10:28.960 --> 10:32.331
Hi! Give us five-star cleaning.

10:32.364 --> 10:33.832
Also...

10:33.865 --> 10:35.868
There is a Chinese
New Year party tonight,

10:35.901 --> 10:37.770
open to all the customers
in the community.

10:37.803 --> 10:38.871
Thank you.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.639
- Please come and enjoy...
- This is fine.

10:40.672 --> 10:41.707
- The good food...
- OK.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.142
- And nice music, OK?
- Alright.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.144
I get you an invite.
Moment... moment, please.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.546
- Can you hear this right now?
- Joy, wait! Please!

10:47.579 --> 10:49.248
I have something to say to you!

10:49.281 --> 10:50.950
What?

10:59.324 --> 11:00.559
You...

11:01.426 --> 11:03.562
you have to try
and eat healthier.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.666
You are getting fat.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.816
Evelyn?

12:00.552 --> 12:01.654
Evelyn?

12:26.144 --> 12:27.813
Go, go, go, go!

12:27.846 --> 12:29.081
OK!

13:11.556 --> 13:13.659
If I have to think
of one more thing today,

13:13.692 --> 13:15.828
my head will explode.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.109
You may be in grave danger.

13:31.142 --> 13:33.746
There's no time to explain.
Hold this.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.616
Why are you doing this?

13:37.649 --> 13:38.717
Pay attention.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.220
When we leave this elevator,
you can either turn left

13:41.253 --> 13:42.597
towards your scheduled
audit appointment

13:42.621 --> 13:46.192
or you can turn right and go
into the janitor's closet.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.294
Why would I go
into the janitor's...

13:49.327 --> 13:50.529
Not now.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.535
Why you download
all these apps on my phone?

13:58.670 --> 13:59.705
Breathe in.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.841
You're gonna feel a slight
pressure in your head.

14:02.941 --> 14:04.643
Huh!

15:02.334 --> 15:04.169
Hey, baby Joy!

15:04.202 --> 15:06.071
You come back here!

15:06.104 --> 15:07.339
Shut up!

15:07.372 --> 15:09.207
You don't talk
to your mother like this!

15:09.240 --> 15:12.177
I'll talk to her
how I fucking want!

15:16.014 --> 15:18.283
Activation...

15:21.219 --> 15:22.988
The moment you're
situated in your meeting,

15:23.021 --> 15:24.623
follow these instructions.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.893
But, remember, no-one can know.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.261
Don't even talk to me about this

15:29.294 --> 15:30.862
because I won't remember.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.564
- But I...
- Shh.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.569
Mental scan complete.

15:45.677 --> 15:47.279
Talk to you soon.

16:13.671 --> 16:15.307
Hello!

16:19.010 --> 16:21.246
Mrs Wang?

16:22.047 --> 16:23.649
Mrs Wang?

16:24.482 --> 16:26.652
Mrs Wang, are you with us?

16:28.086 --> 16:29.588
Yes.

16:30.388 --> 16:31.857
Of course. I am here.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.458
- Just thinking.
- Oh, OK.

16:33.491 --> 16:36.495
Well, I was just hoping...

16:37.262 --> 16:39.598
that you could explain this.

16:44.335 --> 16:46.271
This is a receipt.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.841
My receipt.

16:53.211 --> 16:54.446
Look, I...

16:54.479 --> 16:57.549
I was just hoping
you could enlighten me

16:57.582 --> 17:00.719
as to how,
as a laundromat owner,

17:00.752 --> 17:02.587
a karaoke machine

17:02.620 --> 17:04.823
could constitute
a business expense?

17:04.856 --> 17:06.691
I am a singer.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.662
- Of course you are.
- It's true.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.964
She has a beautiful voice. Oh!

17:12.997 --> 17:14.966
Evelyn, sing a song for her.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.902
- Shh!
- No, no, please.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.470
That will not be necessary.

17:18.503 --> 17:21.406
But I will need
a separate Schedule C

17:21.439 --> 17:24.609
for each of these businesses

17:24.642 --> 17:27.512
because based on what
you're trying to deduct,

17:27.545 --> 17:30.949
you're also a novelist
and a chef.

17:30.982 --> 17:32.851
Last time, you told me that...

17:32.884 --> 17:34.853
Please.

17:34.886 --> 17:36.221
A teacher,

17:36.254 --> 17:39.558
uh, and a singing coach

17:39.591 --> 17:42.260
and a 'Watsu' technician.

17:42.293 --> 17:45.531
I'm sorry.
What... what is 'Watsu'?

17:46.364 --> 17:48.100
It's a water massage.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.836
What's a water massage?

17:50.869 --> 17:53.004
Like... like for back pain.

17:53.037 --> 17:54.473
You go get a water massage.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.074
- Oh, you go?
- Yes.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.165
What's happening?

18:53.198 --> 18:55.701
Like I'm talking
to my ex-husband.

18:56.467 --> 18:59.538
Like I said to you before,
co-mingling of your...

18:59.571 --> 19:01.606
- It's you messing with my head.
- Shh!

19:01.639 --> 19:03.642
- Don't shh me!
- You got to relax your body.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.577
Don't...

19:05.610 --> 19:06.611
Calm down, please!

19:06.644 --> 19:08.446
Calm down.

19:08.479 --> 19:11.049
Relax your body
in the other universe. Please.

19:12.483 --> 19:13.518
These deductions...

19:13.551 --> 19:15.053
Go into auto-pilot.

19:15.887 --> 19:17.889
You can't then
deduct it if it's an off...

19:17.922 --> 19:20.725
Good. Good.

19:20.758 --> 19:23.361
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet

19:23.394 --> 19:25.463
so, hopefully, I'll have
some time to explain.

19:25.496 --> 19:28.166
I am not your husband.
At least not the one you know.

19:28.199 --> 19:29.467
I am another version of him

19:29.500 --> 19:31.336
from another life path,
another universe.

19:31.369 --> 19:34.173
I'm here because
we need your help.

19:35.206 --> 19:37.676
Very busy today.
No time to help you.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.844
Shh!

19:38.877 --> 19:41.479
There is a great evil
that has taken root in my world

19:41.512 --> 19:43.014
and has begun
spreading its chaos

19:43.047 --> 19:44.124
throughout the many verses.

19:44.148 --> 19:45.750
I have spent years searching

19:45.783 --> 19:47.519
for the one who might
be able to match

19:47.552 --> 19:49.721
this great evil
with an even greater good

19:49.754 --> 19:51.256
and bring back balance.

19:51.289 --> 19:53.692
All those years of searching
have brought me here...

19:53.725 --> 19:56.027
- Mrs Wang?
- ..to this universe.

19:56.060 --> 19:56.961
- Hello?!
- To you.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.964
I know it's a lot
to take in right now...

19:58.997 --> 19:59.965
Mrs Wang?!

19:59.998 --> 20:01.567
Hello?

20:02.467 --> 20:04.769
Look, I'm sure you have
a lot on your mind,

20:04.802 --> 20:08.873
but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more

20:08.906 --> 20:11.776
than the conversation
we are now having

20:11.809 --> 20:14.279
concerning your tax liability.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.281
Uh, need I remind you
that there is

20:16.314 --> 20:17.882
already a lien on your property?

20:17.915 --> 20:19.851
Repossession is well
within our rights.

20:19.884 --> 20:23.055
I know. I am paying attention.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.595
Do you see these?

20:31.663 --> 20:33.865
You don't get one of these

20:33.898 --> 20:36.001
unless you've seen
a lot of bullshit.

20:36.034 --> 20:37.603
Excuse my French.

20:38.369 --> 20:39.738
Now you may...

20:39.771 --> 20:42.907
only see a pile of
boring forms and numbers,

20:42.940 --> 20:44.810
but I see a story.

20:46.044 --> 20:49.080
With nothing
but a stack of receipts,

20:49.113 --> 20:53.085
I can trace the ups and downs
of your lives.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.655
And it does not look good.

20:57.622 --> 21:01.626
It does not look good.

21:01.659 --> 21:03.995
- But...
- Uh...

21:04.028 --> 21:08.500
Sorry, my wife confuses
her hobbies for businesses.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.569
An honest mistake.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.572
Oh! OK.

21:14.339 --> 21:17.242
Well, with all of these, um...

21:18.509 --> 21:19.911
"honest mistakes,"

21:19.944 --> 21:23.048
I mean, even if we don't
charge you with fraud,

21:23.081 --> 21:25.583
we'll most certainly
have to fine you

21:25.616 --> 21:28.586
for gross negligence.

21:28.619 --> 21:30.588
You're always
trying to confuse us

21:30.621 --> 21:33.025
with these big words.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.428
I thought
you were going to bring

21:36.461 --> 21:40.332
your daughter
to help you translate.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.667
- I am going to bring my...
- Hey!

21:42.700 --> 21:44.269
- Sorry.
- Evelyn?

21:44.302 --> 21:45.403
She was going to come...

21:45.436 --> 21:47.205
Evelyn!
Are you paying attention?

21:47.238 --> 21:48.373
I cannot talk now.

21:48.406 --> 21:49.874
She's too busy
to help her parents?

21:49.907 --> 21:51.509
Unless you can help me
with my taxes.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.845
What is "gross necklaces"?

21:53.878 --> 21:55.947
I know you have a lot
of things on your mind,

21:55.980 --> 21:57.716
but nothing could
possibly matter more

21:57.749 --> 21:59.351
than this conversation
we are having

21:59.384 --> 22:00.785
right now concerning the fate

22:00.818 --> 22:03.488
of every single world
of our infinite multiverse.

22:03.521 --> 22:06.291
Where's the respect for elders?

22:08.259 --> 22:10.061
My dear Evelyn,

22:10.094 --> 22:11.463
I know you.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.198
With every passing moment,

22:13.231 --> 22:15.033
you fear you might have
missed your chance

22:15.066 --> 22:17.502
to make something of your life.

22:17.535 --> 22:19.270
I'm here to tell you

22:19.303 --> 22:20.905
every rejection,

22:20.938 --> 22:24.309
every disappointment
has led you here

22:24.342 --> 22:26.178
to this moment.

22:26.944 --> 22:29.715
Don't let anything
distract you from it.

22:36.821 --> 22:38.824
Do you think this is funny?

22:42.360 --> 22:44.029
So what will it be?

22:44.796 --> 22:46.698
I'm thinking.

22:50.368 --> 22:51.770
Our time here is up.

22:51.803 --> 22:53.471
- They're going to kill us.
- What?

22:53.504 --> 22:57.075
You think you can give us more
time so we can redo all this?

22:57.108 --> 22:59.077
Do not worry,
this is just a burner universe

22:59.110 --> 23:00.612
we are using for communication.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.147
Oh-oh-oh!

23:02.180 --> 23:03.948
You will know when
it is time to fight.

23:03.981 --> 23:06.684
You want to redo?
You're going to resubmit?

23:06.717 --> 23:08.686
- I will be in contact soon.
- Shh, shh, shh.

23:08.719 --> 23:10.989
I think my other husband
is messing up the audit.

23:11.022 --> 23:14.826
Maybe we can look at
all the receipts again and...

23:14.859 --> 23:18.196
Evelyn! Trust no-one. Oh!

23:29.974 --> 23:32.577
Oh, no, no. No, no, no. No...!

23:39.917 --> 23:41.453
Oh, dear lord.

23:43.821 --> 23:46.357
OK. Everything OK.

23:47.758 --> 23:49.427
I think I forget
something at home.

23:49.460 --> 23:51.763
Uh, sit down.

23:57.134 --> 23:59.738
I think I'm going
to regret this.

24:10.581 --> 24:12.117
You can go.

24:14.485 --> 24:16.221
What?

24:18.923 --> 24:21.726
You... you will have...

24:21.759 --> 24:24.762
You will have until
I leave the office tonight

24:24.795 --> 24:27.399
to bring everything in,
6:00 P.M.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.868
Last chance.

24:29.901 --> 24:32.337
- Oh, tomorrow is better...
- Thank you! Thank you!

24:32.370 --> 24:33.805
Thank you. 6:00 P.M.

24:33.838 --> 24:36.541
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the cookies.

24:36.574 --> 24:38.944
They look delicious.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.948
Last chance!

24:43.981 --> 24:45.383
Have a nice day.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.919
Last chance.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.402
Oh, no.

25:05.436 --> 25:07.105
Evelyn! Evelyn!

25:17.014 --> 25:19.017
So you know about this?

25:26.090 --> 25:29.494
It was you. Like,
you who was in the elevator.

25:32.863 --> 25:34.499
I was in the elevator.

25:34.532 --> 25:35.934
Come back next week.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.881
I'm not ready to fight.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.484
I am not ready to fight.

25:53.517 --> 25:54.819
Maybe we don't have a choice.

25:54.852 --> 25:56.054
What?

26:13.938 --> 26:16.107
Switch shoes to what?

26:16.140 --> 26:18.476
- Ow! Oh!
- Evelyn?!

26:18.509 --> 26:19.711
Someone call security!

26:19.744 --> 26:21.312
What are you doing?

26:21.345 --> 26:22.580
You told me to do it!

26:22.613 --> 26:26.050
You said I would know
when it is the time to fight!

26:26.083 --> 26:27.652
She was coming after us.

26:27.685 --> 26:29.988
Oh!

26:30.021 --> 26:33.558
Oh, you have no idea, lady. Oh!

26:33.591 --> 26:36.227
Assaulting an IRS agent?

26:36.260 --> 26:39.464
You have no idea!

26:44.635 --> 26:47.372
"Dissolution of marriage"?

26:48.973 --> 26:50.708
Yes, I'm on the tenth floor.

26:50.741 --> 26:52.544
No...

27:04.155 --> 27:06.658
Your brother gets a divorce,

27:06.691 --> 27:09.460
now you think divorce is OK?

27:09.493 --> 27:11.329
I don't think it's OK!

27:13.531 --> 27:15.667
We made a sacred promise.

27:21.872 --> 27:24.209
I told you to stay low
and out of sight.

27:25.576 --> 27:28.346
Oh, now you're here?

27:28.379 --> 27:31.249
Huh! Stop confusing me,
coming and going.

27:31.282 --> 27:32.426
- Stop it, stop it, stop...
- Relax.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.018
I'll get you out of this.

27:34.051 --> 27:35.353
Stop coming here.

27:35.386 --> 27:38.556
OK, folks. Everyone remain calm.

27:38.589 --> 27:40.091
Oh, thank... thank God!

27:40.124 --> 27:42.694
It's that one right there.
The Chinese lady!

27:42.727 --> 27:43.928
No! It's all his fault!

27:43.961 --> 27:45.105
Right there, she assaulted me!

27:45.129 --> 27:47.031
OK, I need you two
to get on the ground

27:47.064 --> 27:48.499
with your hands
behind your heads.

27:48.532 --> 27:50.035
OK, OK, OK.

27:57.441 --> 27:58.910
Sir, please comply.

28:21.465 --> 28:24.302
OK, whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't do it.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.183
Sir?

28:58.502 --> 29:00.004
It's OK.

29:01.138 --> 29:03.541
OK, sir. That's enough.

29:16.353 --> 29:19.290
Oh!

29:42.379 --> 29:43.715
Holy shit.

29:50.421 --> 29:52.190
Hyah!

30:00.764 --> 30:03.134
Oh!

30:29.827 --> 30:31.229
Hey.

30:41.939 --> 30:43.842
Oh, no, Craig! Fuck.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.185
Arggh!

31:06.497 --> 31:07.765
On your feet.

31:07.798 --> 31:10.668
Who... What is happening?

31:12.636 --> 31:14.381
I'm not the Waymond
who wants to divorce you.

31:14.405 --> 31:16.040
I'm the Waymond
who is saving your life.

31:16.073 --> 31:17.350
Now, you can either come with me

31:17.374 --> 31:19.043
and live up to
your ultimate potential

31:19.076 --> 31:20.778
or lie here and live
with the consequences.

31:20.811 --> 31:22.347
I want to lie here.

31:23.113 --> 31:25.283
Hey, hey, hey.

31:25.316 --> 31:26.984
No, no! Put me down! No, no!

31:40.097 --> 31:46.037
Citizens of
the 4,655th Thetaverse,

31:46.070 --> 31:48.639
you are about to be graced

31:48.672 --> 31:52.710
by the presence
of our sovereign leader,

31:52.743 --> 31:54.312
Jobu Tupaki.

31:56.313 --> 31:59.116
Now let me assure you
of one thing.

31:59.149 --> 32:01.619
Just like the rest
of your miserable lives,

32:01.652 --> 32:03.321
this is nothing more

32:03.354 --> 32:06.557
than a statistical
inevitability.

32:09.259 --> 32:11.062
Duck.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.864
Duck.

32:14.465 --> 32:15.333
Duck...

32:15.366 --> 32:16.534
Jobu Tupaki

32:16.567 --> 32:19.837
has seen all and knows all.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.173
She knows what makes you tick,

32:22.206 --> 32:27.412
on what fragile branches
your self-worth rests.

32:28.345 --> 32:31.115
This one.

32:42.593 --> 32:43.527
Hang on.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.397
Don't die yet, alright, buddy?

32:47.865 --> 32:49.968
Ugh.

33:01.979 --> 33:03.347
It's not her.

33:03.380 --> 33:04.958
Police are
looking for all information.

33:04.982 --> 33:06.250
This is a developing story.

33:06.283 --> 33:07.827
- What we do know...
- They might be close.

33:07.851 --> 33:10.154
We do have unconfirmed
photos of the suspects.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.390
An unidentified man

33:12.423 --> 33:13.858
went berserk
at the regional office

33:13.891 --> 33:16.494
for the Internal Revenue Service
in Simi Valley this morning.

33:16.527 --> 33:17.971
Police aren't releasing
any information...

33:17.995 --> 33:20.498
- Is that where your parents are?
- This is a developing story.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.366
- But we do have unconfirmed...
- Are you OK?

33:22.399 --> 33:23.501
Photos of the suspects.

33:23.534 --> 33:25.069
- If you recognise them...
- Hey!

33:25.102 --> 33:28.005
- Are you OK?
- ..help identify them.

33:28.038 --> 33:29.540
Joy?

33:31.909 --> 33:33.711
If you recognise these two,

33:33.744 --> 33:36.080
police are seeking help
identifying the assailants.

33:44.321 --> 33:46.390
My husband won't
even kill a spider.

33:46.423 --> 33:48.125
How can you be the same person?

33:48.158 --> 33:49.927
You underestimate
how the smallest decisions

33:49.960 --> 33:52.963
can compound into significant
differences over a lifetime.

33:52.996 --> 33:54.532
Every tiny decision creates

33:54.565 --> 33:56.700
another branching
universe, another...

33:56.733 --> 33:58.569
Were you not paying
attention before?

33:58.602 --> 34:00.905
Of course. You're just
very bad at explaining...

34:00.938 --> 34:02.340
Shh!

34:06.410 --> 34:08.079
Don't push me!

34:09.546 --> 34:12.316
Oh, my God! We have to go back.

34:12.349 --> 34:13.517
We forgot my father!

34:13.550 --> 34:16.187
Don't worry. We're
monitoring him. He's safe.

34:16.220 --> 34:17.620
- I don't know. Are you sure?
- Yes.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.592
Hey, look, come on!

34:21.625 --> 34:23.561
Look, this is your universe,

34:23.594 --> 34:26.831
one bubble floating in
the cosmic foam of existence.

34:26.864 --> 34:29.667
Every surrounding bubble
has slight variations.

34:29.700 --> 34:31.936
But the further away
you get from your universe,

34:31.969 --> 34:33.571
the bigger the differences.

34:33.604 --> 34:37.208
This is where I am from,
The Alphaverse.

34:37.975 --> 34:40.411
The first universe to make
contact with the others.

34:40.444 --> 34:42.580
You can call me Alpha Waymond.

34:46.116 --> 34:47.485
In this world,

34:47.518 --> 34:50.354
you were a brilliant woman.

34:50.387 --> 34:51.922
In your search to prove

34:51.955 --> 34:53.557
the existence
of other universes,

34:53.590 --> 34:55.793
you discovered a way
to temporarily link

34:55.826 --> 34:58.696
your consciousness to another
version of yourself,

34:58.729 --> 35:00.231
accessing all of their memories,

35:00.264 --> 35:03.200
their skills,
even their emotions.

35:03.233 --> 35:06.670
Like you with the Fanny pack?

35:06.703 --> 35:09.807
Exactly.
It's called Verse Jumping.

35:09.840 --> 35:10.875
"Verse Jumping."

35:10.908 --> 35:13.244
I need you to learn
how to do it right now.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.979
Right now?!

35:15.779 --> 35:18.616
It may be our only chance
of getting out of here alive.

35:29.226 --> 35:30.761
Two guards coming this way.

35:30.794 --> 35:32.930
On my signal, try to blend in.

35:34.731 --> 35:37.735
Why don't you get
your Evelyn to do this?

35:38.502 --> 35:40.337
My Evelyn is dead.

35:40.370 --> 35:42.039
Go! Oh, my God!

35:42.072 --> 35:43.340
Oh, my God, what is going on?

35:43.373 --> 35:45.109
Help us! Help us!

35:54.117 --> 35:55.753
How did I die?

35:55.786 --> 35:57.955
I've seen you die
a thousand ways,

35:57.988 --> 35:59.757
in a thousand worlds.

36:00.524 --> 36:03.427
In every single one,
you were murdered.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.596
What? Why would anybody
want to kill me?

36:05.629 --> 36:08.432
She's an omniversal being
with unimaginable power,

36:08.465 --> 36:10.134
an agent of pure chaos,

36:10.167 --> 36:12.170
with no real motives or desires.

36:12.936 --> 36:15.539
- Jobu Tupaki.
- You're just making up sounds.

36:15.572 --> 36:17.608
Shh!

36:20.210 --> 36:21.879
We need another exit.

36:23.513 --> 36:25.349
So let her destroy
the other bubbles.

36:25.382 --> 36:26.817
You said there are
so many of them.

36:26.850 --> 36:29.086
Maybe it's OK if we lose some,

36:29.119 --> 36:31.189
but just leave me out of it.

36:33.557 --> 36:35.893
It's not so simple.

36:38.562 --> 36:40.698
She's been building something.

36:41.465 --> 36:44.335
We thought it was
some sort of black hole.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.536
But it appears to consume

36:45.569 --> 36:47.638
more than just light and matter.

36:47.671 --> 36:49.840
We don't know exactly
what it is.

36:49.873 --> 36:52.142
We don't know what it's for.

36:52.175 --> 36:54.245
But we can all

36:54.278 --> 36:55.579
feel it.

36:55.612 --> 36:58.382
You've been feeling it too,
haven't you?

36:58.415 --> 36:59.984
Something is off.

37:00.017 --> 37:03.020
Your clothes never wear
as well the next day.

37:03.053 --> 37:06.023
Your hair never falls
in quite the same way.

37:06.056 --> 37:08.226
Even your coffee tastes...

37:09.192 --> 37:10.828
wrong.

37:11.728 --> 37:14.265
Our institutions are crumbling.

37:14.298 --> 37:17.067
Nobody trusts
their neighbour anymore.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.470
And you stay up at night
wondering to yourself...

37:19.503 --> 37:21.839
How can we get back?

37:23.907 --> 37:27.011
This is
the Alphaverse's mission -

37:27.044 --> 37:29.913
to take us back
to how it's supposed to be.

37:29.946 --> 37:32.283
But that begins
with finding the one

37:32.316 --> 37:36.087
who can stand up to Jobu's
perverse shroud of chaos.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.990
And you think it's me?

37:39.756 --> 37:41.158
Why else would
we risk everything

37:41.191 --> 37:42.893
to get you out of here?

37:52.502 --> 37:55.439
Oh, there you are.

37:55.472 --> 37:57.775
Oh, Miss Deirdre!

37:57.808 --> 38:00.311
I'm sorry I punched you, but...

38:00.344 --> 38:01.879
Look.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.348
I think I finally
understand why...

38:07.184 --> 38:08.585
What is she doing?

38:08.618 --> 38:10.421
Verse Jumping. Run!

38:19.663 --> 38:20.898
- Come on.
- Oh!

38:20.931 --> 38:23.267
Go! Go! Go!

38:27.804 --> 38:30.107
She jumped somewhere.
Brute force.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.275
The sumo wrestler?

38:31.308 --> 38:32.609
- Body builder?
- Doesn't matter.

38:32.642 --> 38:34.078
Counter with someone agile.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.814
On your perimeter, we've got
a break dancer, mime...

38:36.847 --> 38:38.415
- A gymnast.
- Give me gymnast!

38:38.448 --> 38:39.683
- Go!
- Calculating route.

38:42.252 --> 38:44.221
OK,
some paper cuts, four of them.

38:44.254 --> 38:45.690
One between each finger.

38:49.059 --> 38:51.228
Paper cuts only happen
when you aren't trying.

38:51.261 --> 38:52.396
It's impossible.

38:52.429 --> 38:54.531
Probability - 1 in 8,000.

38:54.564 --> 38:57.234
It's the strongest
jumping pad we have.

38:59.002 --> 39:01.205
- What are you doing?
- Come on, come on.

39:08.211 --> 39:09.980
There we go, one.

39:11.181 --> 39:13.351
- There's two.
- Ooh.

39:15.185 --> 39:16.854
- Ugh!
- Three.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.623
Alright, come on, come on,
come on. Stick with me.

39:21.057 --> 39:22.326
Come on.

39:30.033 --> 39:31.368
- Four! There it is.

39:31.401 --> 39:33.370
OK, come on, jump!

39:41.445 --> 39:42.713
Huh!

39:42.746 --> 39:44.782
Is that pro wrestling?

39:45.549 --> 39:46.749
She's going for a backbreaker!

40:17.080 --> 40:18.449
- She's gotta run.
- No.

40:18.482 --> 40:20.584
She can jump,
somewhere she can fight.

40:20.617 --> 40:21.852
She's not ready.

40:21.885 --> 40:24.121
A jump like that would fry
most people.

40:24.888 --> 40:26.857
She's not most people.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.230
Damn, what a weak body.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.373
- Hello?
- Evelyn!

40:43.406 --> 40:44.808
Can you hear me?

40:44.841 --> 40:46.543
You're going to have
to Verse Jump.

40:46.576 --> 40:48.179
Verse Jump?

40:58.989 --> 41:00.257
Hello?

41:00.290 --> 41:01.492
Concentrate on a universe

41:01.525 --> 41:03.427
in which you studied
martial arts.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.003
OK, I'm locking in.

41:14.070 --> 41:15.806
Calculations complete.

41:15.839 --> 41:17.608
"Profess your love."

41:18.742 --> 41:21.278
You're gonna have
to profess your love to Deirdre.

41:21.311 --> 41:24.047
- No way.
- It's your jumping pad.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.350
It's like eating the chapstick
or switching shoes.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.752
We developed an algorithm
that calculates

41:28.785 --> 41:30.129
which statistically
improbable action

41:30.153 --> 41:31.889
will place you in a universe

41:31.922 --> 41:33.457
on the edge
of your local cluster,

41:33.490 --> 41:36.226
which then sling shots you
to the desired universe.

41:37.861 --> 41:39.530
That doesn't make any sense!

41:39.563 --> 41:41.131
Exactly.

41:41.164 --> 41:43.400
The less sense it makes,
the better.

41:43.433 --> 41:46.603
The Stochastic Path Algorithm
is fuelled by random actions.

41:46.636 --> 41:48.939
Tell her you love her
and mean it.

41:48.972 --> 41:51.675
Are there any
other jumping pads?

41:52.542 --> 41:56.013
The next best paths are break
your own arm or take a nap.

41:56.046 --> 41:57.714
You're not sleepy, are you?

42:02.152 --> 42:03.120
I love you.

42:03.153 --> 42:04.922
Jumping pad failure.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.391
Evelyn, wait! No!

42:15.131 --> 42:16.533
No.

42:16.566 --> 42:18.402
She's in
a local divergent universe.

42:18.435 --> 42:19.970
No, no, no.

42:20.003 --> 42:21.906
She's gone home...

42:22.706 --> 42:24.541
to finish the taxes.

42:28.011 --> 42:29.446
Ah!

42:46.630 --> 42:48.765
This doesn't make any sense.

42:48.798 --> 42:50.534
Think about it.

42:53.169 --> 42:55.439
You always get pulled away.

43:03.179 --> 43:04.581
Waymond!

43:04.614 --> 43:06.984
Waymond!

43:09.152 --> 43:10.921
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

43:10.954 --> 43:12.589
- Huh?
- I need to go.

43:12.622 --> 43:13.824
What?

43:13.857 --> 43:15.759
I need to find the right Evelyn.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.861
And this one,

43:17.894 --> 43:19.696
it's not the one.

43:19.729 --> 43:22.232
No! No. Wait, let me try again!

43:24.334 --> 43:25.736
Alpha Waymond?

43:25.769 --> 43:27.871
Evelyn?!

43:30.540 --> 43:31.708
- Oh.
- Huh?

43:33.777 --> 43:35.579
Ah! What's happened to my hand?

43:40.984 --> 43:43.120
Go, go, go, go!

43:45.789 --> 43:47.024
Evelyn, your face.

43:47.057 --> 43:48.759
You just left me.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.961
You just left me!

44:33.436 --> 44:34.436
Waymond...

44:36.506 --> 44:38.408
Miss Deirdre?

44:38.441 --> 44:40.243
- I love you!
- What?

44:41.911 --> 44:43.146
I love you!

44:43.179 --> 44:45.616
No, no!

44:48.551 --> 44:49.720
I love you!

45:05.535 --> 45:08.605
I love you!

45:14.744 --> 45:16.747
I love...

45:37.700 --> 45:39.436
Evelyn!

46:04.194 --> 46:06.563
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

46:13.469 --> 46:16.006
Oh, I'm so
happy to be here today.

46:16.039 --> 46:18.475
- Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

46:18.508 --> 46:19.710
Evelyn!

47:00.450 --> 47:02.085
Oh!

47:15.665 --> 47:18.502
Why did you... How?

47:30.613 --> 47:32.349
It was beautiful.

47:44.560 --> 47:45.896
Waymond.

47:46.963 --> 47:48.431
We better keep moving.

47:48.464 --> 47:51.869
Now you've definitely
got Jobu's attention. Come on.

48:03.146 --> 48:04.681
Stay calm.

48:04.714 --> 48:07.684
Your brain is under
an incredible amount of stress.

48:07.717 --> 48:10.387
No, let me finish
talking with my husband.

48:10.420 --> 48:13.156
He needs to know how good
my life could have been.

48:14.624 --> 48:16.960
- Evelyn! Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

48:20.897 --> 48:23.433
- Ow!
- Are you with me?

48:24.200 --> 48:26.236
I thought I was disconnected.

48:26.269 --> 48:27.704
Why was I still there?

48:27.737 --> 48:30.540
Your mind, it's like
a Clay pot holding water.

48:30.573 --> 48:32.342
Every jump opens another crack,

48:32.375 --> 48:33.944
causing things to leak through.

48:33.977 --> 48:36.647
With training, you will learn
to reseal these cracks.

48:38.414 --> 48:40.651
Eat. You need energy.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.588
Cream cheese.

48:46.589 --> 48:47.724
Mmm!

48:47.757 --> 48:51.161
In my universe,
the cattle were killed off.

48:51.194 --> 48:52.762
One of the many things
we've lost

48:52.795 --> 48:54.631
in our war against Jobu.

48:57.166 --> 48:58.902
Oh, my God.

48:58.935 --> 49:00.437
What if...

49:01.270 --> 49:03.073
what if I want to go back?

49:03.840 --> 49:06.543
What if I want to go back
to the other universe?

49:06.576 --> 49:09.145
Shut it down!
Shut it down, you hear me!

49:09.178 --> 49:11.081
- Come back!
- OK! OK! OK!

49:11.114 --> 49:12.916
I... I'm back!

49:15.018 --> 49:16.720
Listen, you're only using

49:16.753 --> 49:18.755
the other worlds to acquire
special skills.

49:18.788 --> 49:19.990
Do you understand?

49:20.023 --> 49:21.300
If you fall
for their temptations,

49:21.324 --> 49:23.593
you invite contradiction, chaos.

49:23.626 --> 49:27.831
The Clay pot could shatter
and you could die, or far worse.

49:29.198 --> 49:31.368
What can be worse than death?

49:32.969 --> 49:34.871
We should keep moving
until reinforcements come.

49:34.904 --> 49:36.306
No, no, no!

49:36.339 --> 49:40.777
Enough of your Clay pots,
cream cheese, no cows.

49:40.810 --> 49:43.647
Explain it all to me now.

49:48.217 --> 49:49.820
You're right.

49:51.220 --> 49:52.722
In the Alphaverse,

49:52.755 --> 49:56.092
we began training many
young minds to Verse Jump.

49:56.125 --> 49:59.262
But there was one who was far
and above the most gifted.

49:59.295 --> 50:01.364
Our little explorer.

50:01.397 --> 50:03.433
You saw her potential...

50:03.466 --> 50:05.702
so you pushed her

50:05.735 --> 50:07.437
beyond her limit.

50:07.470 --> 50:10.273
Warning. Unstable.

50:11.707 --> 50:13.476
Though the
overloaded mind usually dies,

50:13.509 --> 50:16.279
instead her mind was fractured.

50:17.213 --> 50:18.882
Warning. Unstable.

50:18.915 --> 50:20.984
- Mind fracturing.

50:23.986 --> 50:28.158
Now her mind
experiences every world,

50:28.191 --> 50:29.526
every possibility,

50:29.559 --> 50:31.594
at the same exact time,

50:31.627 --> 50:32.962
commanding
the infinite knowledge

50:32.995 --> 50:35.065
and power of the multiverse.

50:36.065 --> 50:37.400
Now she's seen too much,

50:37.433 --> 50:39.169
lost any sense of morality,

50:39.202 --> 50:41.271
any belief in objective truth.

50:41.304 --> 50:43.540
What does she want?

50:43.573 --> 50:45.875
No-one knows.

50:45.908 --> 50:47.277
All we know

50:47.310 --> 50:49.746
is she's looking for you.

50:53.816 --> 50:57.454
Hey, you said
I was the wrong one.

50:57.487 --> 51:00.924
What you did back there,
it changed my mind.

51:01.924 --> 51:04.461
You were incredible.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.131
Waymond.

52:05.555 --> 52:07.390
Of course.

52:25.641 --> 52:27.243
Evelyn! Come back!

52:27.276 --> 52:28.687
Evelyn! Jump
to another combat universe!

52:28.711 --> 52:29.846
- Huh?
- Try peeing yourself!

52:29.879 --> 52:31.439
- Pee?
- It's always a good jumping pad!

52:35.184 --> 52:37.987
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

52:38.020 --> 52:39.255
What did you do to me?

52:39.288 --> 52:41.624
Did you staple something

52:41.657 --> 52:43.435
No! I didn't do anything.
You did it yourself!

52:43.459 --> 52:45.828
- Did we call for backup?
- I did not do it to myself!

52:45.861 --> 52:47.730
- Did you call?
- It has blood on it!

52:47.763 --> 52:51.401
We've detained the assailants.
No backup was requested.

a trip up. Copy?

52:55.338 --> 52:58.041
Oh, no! She found us.

Aww!

59:35.204 --> 59:36.839

- Here.

59:51.754 --> 59:53.523
It's OK.

59:54.556 --> 59:55.658

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:13.509
Oh, shit.

1:00:13.542 --> 1:00:15.144
What is that?

1:00:15.177 --> 1:00:16.846
I got bored one day

1:00:16.879 --> 1:00:20.083
and I put everything on a bagel.

1:00:22.584 --> 1:00:24.453
Everything.

1:00:24.486 --> 1:00:28.758
All my hopes and dreams,
my old report cards,

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:30.092

1:00:41.036 --> 1:00:43.305

1:02:12.828 --> 1:02:14.964
Sir, what are you doing here?

1:02:14.997 --> 1:02:17.366
We need to go. Just follow me.

1:02:32.981 --> 1:02:34.350
Sir, I have this under control.

1:02:34.383 --> 1:02:37.253
Again,
you deliberately disobey me

1:02:47.996 --> 1:02:50.332
No! Please.

1:02:50.365 --> 1:02:52.301
She's unlike anything
we've seen.

1:02:52.334 --> 1:02:55.070
She could finally stop
Jobu Tupaki.

1:02:55.103 --> 1:02:57.673
You mean the monster
that is inside my daughter?

1:02:57.706 --> 1:03:00.276
Well, why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

1:03:00.309 --> 1:03:02.878
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

1:03:02.911 --> 1:03:05.181
Did you see her
dance that man to death?

1:03:05.214 --> 1:03:09.652
There is no way I am
the Evelyn you are looking for.

1:03:09.685 --> 1:03:12.021
No, I see it so clearly.

1:03:12.054 --> 1:03:14.123
See what?

1:03:15.624 --> 1:03:18.260
I'm no good at anything.

1:03:18.293 --> 1:03:19.495
Exactly.

1:03:19.528 --> 1:03:21.964
I've seen thousands of Evelyns,

1:03:21.997 --> 1:03:24.366
but never an Evelyn like you.

1:03:24.399 --> 1:03:27.236
You have so many goals
you never finished,

1:03:27.269 --> 1:03:29.939
dreams you never followed.

1:03:29.972 --> 1:03:32.642
You're living your worst you.

1:03:34.509 --> 1:03:37.880
I cannot be the worst.
What about that hot dog one?

1:03:37.913 --> 1:03:40.182
No. Can't you see?

1:03:40.215 --> 1:03:43.052
Every failure here
branched off into a success

1:03:43.085 --> 1:03:45.020
for another Evelyn
in another life.

1:03:45.053 --> 1:03:48.157
Most people only
have a few significant

1:03:48.190 --> 1:03:50.559
alternate life paths
so close to them.

1:03:50.592 --> 1:03:52.895
But you, here,

1:03:52.928 --> 1:03:55.865
you're capable of anything

1:03:55.898 --> 1:03:59.135
because you're so bad
at everything.

1:04:03.472 --> 1:04:05.374
What good is all that power
when her mind

1:04:05.407 --> 1:04:09.144
is already succumbing
to that chaos, huh?

1:04:09.177 --> 1:04:11.847
Hello?

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:13.682
Hello? Mom, Dad?
What's going on?

1:04:13.715 --> 1:04:16.285
No. Do not answer her.

1:04:16.318 --> 1:04:18.621
It's one of her tricks.

1:04:18.654 --> 1:04:21.891
Sir, our readings indicate
it's not Jobu Tupaki.

1:04:22.891 --> 1:04:24.260
But if she's not here...

1:04:27.863 --> 1:04:29.031
Oh, shit!

1:04:32.301 --> 1:04:35.604

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.544

of the Alphaverse for this.

1:04:54.923 --> 1:04:56.167
- No, no... That's not...
- Joy's here!

1:04:56.191 --> 1:04:57.602
- No, no, no, that's not Joy.
- Hello?

1:04:57.626 --> 1:05:01.230
- Joy? Joy, I'm coming.
- Let me in.

1:05:01.263 --> 1:05:04.467
OK, be patient! This is heavy.

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:08.170
- Joy, why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

1:05:08.203 --> 1:05:10.306
- Hey, gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

1:05:10.339 --> 1:05:12.875
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for all of this...

1:05:14.276 --> 1:05:16.779
What the fuck, Mom?!

1:05:17.913 --> 1:05:19.882
What the fuck are you doing?

1:05:27.723 --> 1:05:30.393
But... she's too powerful.

1:05:31.693 --> 1:05:34.263
Are we all having a stroke?

1:05:43.638 --> 1:05:46.342
You are like puppets.
You know? Puppets?

1:05:46.375 --> 1:05:49.078
You can do things
you normally cannot do.

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:51.180
It's like that movie.

1:05:51.213 --> 1:05:53.482
Um, you... you... That movie...

1:05:53.515 --> 1:05:54.984
OK, what are you talking about?

1:05:55.017 --> 1:05:56.685
- A movie?
- 'Raccaccoonie'!

1:05:56.718 --> 1:05:57.853
- What?
- Huh?

1:05:57.886 --> 1:05:58.821
'Raccaccoonie', you know?

1:05:58.854 --> 1:06:00.889
The one with the chef...

1:06:00.922 --> 1:06:02.558
And he makes bad food. Phooey.

1:06:02.591 --> 1:06:04.660
And then this raccoon
sit on his head,

1:06:04.693 --> 1:06:08.797
ooh, control him,
and then he cooks good food.

1:06:08.830 --> 1:06:11.000
Do you mean 'Ratatouille'?

1:06:11.033 --> 1:06:12.568
'Ratatouille'?
I like that movie.

1:06:12.601 --> 1:06:14.970
No. No, no, no, no, no.
'Raccaccoonie'!

1:06:15.003 --> 1:06:16.138
With the raccoon.

1:06:16.171 --> 1:06:17.706
- OK...
- Raccoon?

1:06:17.739 --> 1:06:19.475
Everybody,
stop making up sounds!

1:06:19.508 --> 1:06:22.644
So there's a raccoon Joy,
and there's a raccoon me?

1:06:22.677 --> 1:06:24.380
And they are controlling us?

1:06:24.413 --> 1:06:26.248
Yeah, from the other universes.

1:06:28.183 --> 1:06:30.052
- Oh. OK.
- That's very funny, Evelyn.

1:06:30.085 --> 1:06:33.789
OK, it sounds a little bit
ridiculous, but it's true.

1:06:33.822 --> 1:06:35.324
I swear to God, you...

1:06:35.357 --> 1:06:36.725
You are macho man.

1:06:36.758 --> 1:06:38.494
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah.

1:06:41.029 --> 1:06:42.297
Hey, honey, don't worry.

1:06:42.330 --> 1:06:44.099
- Daddy will get you out of this.
- Ah Ba?

1:06:44.132 --> 1:06:47.436
Quickly,
while she is distracted.

1:06:48.236 --> 1:06:50.339
- No.
- It's only protocol.

1:06:50.372 --> 1:06:53.275
It gives her one
less universe to access.

1:06:53.308 --> 1:06:54.576
God...

1:06:54.609 --> 1:06:56.412
- Can you...
- Oh, it's Becky.

1:06:56.445 --> 1:06:57.913
Hi, Becky. Hold on.

1:06:57.946 --> 1:07:00.149
How do you expect to defeat
her in every universe

1:07:00.182 --> 1:07:01.884
if you can't even
kill her in one?

1:07:01.917 --> 1:07:03.285
Hey, babe.

1:07:03.318 --> 1:07:05.287
She's your granddaughter.

1:07:06.054 --> 1:07:09.224
How do you think I feel?

1:07:09.257 --> 1:07:11.193
But this is a sacrifice

1:07:11.226 --> 1:07:13.829
that is necessary
to win the war.

1:07:13.862 --> 1:07:16.465
OK, there we go.

1:07:20.769 --> 1:07:22.505
You must do it.

1:07:23.738 --> 1:07:25.374
Go.

1:07:28.176 --> 1:07:29.478
Go.

1:07:29.511 --> 1:07:31.613
Yeah, my mom
taped me to a chair.

1:07:31.646 --> 1:07:33.782
Uh, because of raccoons.

1:07:33.815 --> 1:07:35.884
- OK, be patient.
- Yeah, it's a long story.

1:07:35.917 --> 1:07:37.953
- Daddy's trying to...
- It's been a day.

1:07:45.594 --> 1:07:46.662
Mom?

1:07:46.695 --> 1:07:48.330
I don't like this at all.

1:07:57.873 --> 1:07:59.575
What are you...

1:08:01.977 --> 1:08:03.746
what are you doing?

1:08:07.249 --> 1:08:09.151
Hey! I almost had it.

1:08:09.184 --> 1:08:10.652
Oh, come on!

1:08:10.685 --> 1:08:12.087
You are already under her spell.

1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:14.289
Holy shit!
Holy shit, he has a gun!

1:08:14.322 --> 1:08:15.557
Everyone, stay calm!

1:08:15.590 --> 1:08:17.201
I think it's time
for a family discussion!

1:08:17.225 --> 1:08:19.294
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

1:08:22.631 --> 1:08:25.000
I won't let you kill her.

1:08:25.033 --> 1:08:28.737
Don't you see what
is happening to your mind?

1:08:29.971 --> 1:08:31.707
In my universe,

1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:36.011
you pushed your own daughter
too hard until you broke her.

1:08:36.044 --> 1:08:38.914
You...

1:08:38.947 --> 1:08:41.817
you created Jobu Tupaki.

1:08:41.850 --> 1:08:43.919
When did he get
so good at English?

1:08:45.053 --> 1:08:47.122
Now I must stop you.

1:08:47.155 --> 1:08:49.258
Otherwise, it's only
a matter of time

1:08:49.291 --> 1:08:53.696
before you become just like her.

1:08:55.230 --> 1:08:59.501
Just like her?

1:09:05.607 --> 1:09:08.677
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1:09:08.710 --> 1:09:11.547
Evelyn, I don't think now
is a good time to dance!

1:09:15.183 --> 1:09:16.518
Baba,

1:09:16.551 --> 1:09:18.253
I know you don't agree with me,

1:09:18.286 --> 1:09:19.821
but this is something
I have to do.

1:09:19.854 --> 1:09:21.523
- What the...
- That sounds weird.

1:09:21.556 --> 1:09:23.325
No, no, no...

1:09:23.358 --> 1:09:25.260
- OK.
- Wait!

1:09:25.293 --> 1:09:26.573
You don't know
where you'll jump.

1:09:29.231 --> 1:09:31.167
Enough!

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.969
Warning. Unstable.

1:09:46.047 --> 1:09:47.516
Please.

1:09:47.549 --> 1:09:50.552
I cannot lose another
loved one to the darkness.

1:09:50.585 --> 1:09:54.723
- Warning. Unstable.
- Don't worry. You won't.

1:10:07.002 --> 1:10:10.239
Hey, uh, clean up
in there, alright?

1:10:10.272 --> 1:10:11.974
Here. Oh!

1:10:14.576 --> 1:10:16.011
Where did she jump?!

1:10:16.044 --> 1:10:17.713
Sorry, Ah Ba.

1:10:20.248 --> 1:10:22.017
- Whoa!
- OK!

1:10:22.050 --> 1:10:23.628
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Jesus, Mom!

1:10:23.652 --> 1:10:24.886
- That way!
- Oh, no!

1:10:24.919 --> 1:10:26.688
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, come on!

1:10:26.721 --> 1:10:28.090
- Oh!
- No!

1:10:28.890 --> 1:10:30.759
Warning, mind fracturing.

1:10:30.792 --> 1:10:34.396
Send every Jumper with
a counterpart in the area.

1:10:34.429 --> 1:10:36.632
Now!

1:10:37.399 --> 1:10:40.235
Once again,
the Alphaverse finds itself

1:10:40.268 --> 1:10:44.740
as the last line of defence
against total chaos.

1:10:44.773 --> 1:10:48.877
Be brave. This Evelyn
is as stubborn as the others.

1:10:48.910 --> 1:10:51.079
She has given us no choice.

1:10:51.112 --> 1:10:55.651
We must kill her before she
becomes another Jobu Tupaki.

1:10:57.485 --> 1:10:59.888
- Joy.
- Oh, what?

1:10:59.921 --> 1:11:01.757
Joy... Joy...

1:11:02.657 --> 1:11:06.828
I know you have these feelings,

1:11:06.861 --> 1:11:10.699
feelings that make you so sad.

1:11:11.499 --> 1:11:15.871
That makes you just...
just want to give up.

1:11:17.238 --> 1:11:19.074
It's not your fault.

1:11:20.041 --> 1:11:21.577
Not your fault.

1:11:22.344 --> 1:11:24.246
I know.

1:11:25.313 --> 1:11:27.449
It's... it's her.

1:11:27.482 --> 1:11:30.285
Juju Chewbacca.

1:11:32.387 --> 1:11:35.757
She has your soul...

1:11:35.790 --> 1:11:37.559
in the palm of her hand.

1:11:37.592 --> 1:11:38.894
What are you talking about?

1:11:38.927 --> 1:11:43.065
The only way I can
defeat her to save you...

1:11:44.132 --> 1:11:46.635
is to become like her.

1:11:50.705 --> 1:11:52.007
Evelyn!

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:54.409
Your daughter is beyond saving.

1:11:54.442 --> 1:11:56.578
And soon you will be too.

1:12:00.682 --> 1:12:02.417
Your time is up.

1:12:02.450 --> 1:12:04.820
Find your jumping pads.

1:12:06.154 --> 1:12:10.926
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

1:12:14.162 --> 1:12:16.832

1:12:24.472 --> 1:12:26.742

1:12:26.775 --> 1:12:29.345
I think
you're pushing things too far.

1:12:31.446 --> 1:12:32.914
Or not far enough.

1:12:34.682 --> 1:12:36.852
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1:12:39.587 --> 1:12:41.123
Evelyn?

1:12:41.156 --> 1:12:42.824
- Ugh!
- Oh, my God.

1:12:45.593 --> 1:12:46.862
Oh!

1:12:46.895 --> 1:12:48.630
What are you doing?!

1:13:50.658 --> 1:13:52.427
Mom!

1:14:48.216 --> 1:14:49.284
Arggh!

1:14:54.355 --> 1:14:55.791
Ohh!

1:15:10.705 --> 1:15:13.542
Holy... shit.

1:15:13.575 --> 1:15:15.143
Is he dead?

1:15:17.845 --> 1:15:19.948
See, not dead. Go!

1:15:19.981 --> 1:15:22.181
- That's definitely not...
- Hurry up, please. Go quick!

1:15:22.750 --> 1:15:24.753
OK, come on, guys.

1:15:27.088 --> 1:15:28.523
Dad, go!

1:15:35.563 --> 1:15:37.032
Oh, my God.

1:15:39.801 --> 1:15:43.205
Does my baby
want to go for a walk?

1:15:51.946 --> 1:15:53.648
Yow!

1:15:56.117 --> 1:15:57.953
No!

1:15:57.986 --> 1:16:00.455
Oh, Johnny! Oh!

1:16:02.991 --> 1:16:04.125
Orange soda?

1:16:04.158 --> 1:16:05.961
- Huh?
- What is she doing?

1:16:05.994 --> 1:16:07.762
I think when
she does something weird

1:16:07.795 --> 1:16:09.564
it helps her fight,
it gives her power.

1:16:12.634 --> 1:16:13.969
Sorry, baby.

1:16:20.308 --> 1:16:23.478
Ask her for another one.

1:16:31.119 --> 1:16:32.887
No! Johnny!

1:16:37.859 --> 1:16:39.328
Fried egg?

1:16:40.461 --> 1:16:43.632
You... bitch.

1:16:46.834 --> 1:16:48.403
Go!

1:16:49.804 --> 1:16:52.140
Huh?

1:16:52.173 --> 1:16:53.909
Oh...

1:16:54.676 --> 1:16:56.044
Evelyn, if you don't step up,

1:16:56.077 --> 1:16:57.946
I'm giving some
of your shifts to Chad.

1:17:00.448 --> 1:17:02.717
Yeah!

1:17:02.750 --> 1:17:04.519
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, good one!

1:17:04.552 --> 1:17:05.820
I got a picture!

1:17:18.633 --> 1:17:20.402
Go.

1:18:03.811 --> 1:18:05.280
Stop...

1:18:05.313 --> 1:18:06.981
- Huh? What happened?
- You stop!

1:18:07.014 --> 1:18:08.149
I think they lost their...

1:18:08.182 --> 1:18:09.951
- Stop it!
- ..powers?

1:18:10.918 --> 1:18:12.353
Sir?

1:18:12.386 --> 1:18:14.456
I am gonna need
another jumping pad.

1:18:14.489 --> 1:18:16.658
Received information. Over.

1:18:23.264 --> 1:18:25.042
I think she needs to do
something weird again.

1:18:25.066 --> 1:18:26.601
What's he doing?

1:18:37.411 --> 1:18:39.881
Oh, my God. He's trying
to stick it in his butt.

1:18:39.914 --> 1:18:41.683
No!

1:18:42.784 --> 1:18:44.219
- No, no, no!
- Ah... No!

1:18:46.154 --> 1:18:48.056
Ah, Evelyn, do jumping Jacks!

1:18:48.089 --> 1:18:49.457
That's not weird at all.

1:18:49.490 --> 1:18:50.892
Um... Slap him!

1:18:50.925 --> 1:18:52.594
No, no, no, no!

1:18:52.627 --> 1:18:54.696
Mom, just blow on his nose!

1:18:54.729 --> 1:18:55.997
What?

1:18:56.030 --> 1:18:57.599
It'll make him involuntarily

1:18:57.632 --> 1:18:59.267
scream and do weird noises.

1:18:59.300 --> 1:19:01.736
Trust her, Evelyn!
It's really weird.

1:19:54.388 --> 1:19:56.157
Wow, Mom is really good.

1:19:56.190 --> 1:19:58.360
Huh!

1:19:59.861 --> 1:20:01.396
Sorry.

1:20:21.015 --> 1:20:22.417
Oh!

1:20:24.552 --> 1:20:26.154
Arggh!

1:20:34.061 --> 1:20:35.730
Ahh!

1:20:56.384 --> 1:20:58.186
Reaching mental capacity.

1:21:00.054 --> 1:21:01.689
Reaching mental capacity.

1:21:03.925 --> 1:21:04.925
Holy shit!

1:21:06.193 --> 1:21:09.197
- Ow!
- I'm sorry, Evelyn.

1:21:09.230 --> 1:21:11.366
- Mind fracturing.
- We'll die together.

1:21:31.052 --> 1:21:33.154
Pinky... Arggh!

1:21:35.556 --> 1:21:37.559
- Get her. I see her.
- Let's go!

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:14.228
Evelyn!

1:22:14.261 --> 1:22:16.164
Evelyn. Evelyn!

1:22:16.197 --> 1:22:17.332
Whoa, whoa!

1:22:21.969 --> 1:22:24.205
No need to explain.

1:22:26.107 --> 1:22:27.976
I have been watching you.

1:22:28.009 --> 1:22:30.645
You're back!

1:22:31.545 --> 1:22:33.548
Did you see how good I am?

1:22:34.648 --> 1:22:36.150
I'm gonna do it.

1:22:36.183 --> 1:22:39.887
I am going to defeat
that Jobu Tupaki.

1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:42.657
Hey. You got her name right.

1:22:44.225 --> 1:22:48.830
Evelyn, what you're doing
is crazy, reckless.

1:22:48.863 --> 1:22:52.333
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

1:22:52.366 --> 1:22:56.271
has managed to piss off
everyone in the multiverse.

1:22:57.471 --> 1:22:59.507
But it just might work.

1:23:03.144 --> 1:23:04.445
What? What?

1:23:17.625 --> 1:23:19.861
I only wish I could be there

1:23:19.894 --> 1:23:21.095
to see you finish this.

1:23:21.128 --> 1:23:23.064
What do you mean,
you don't see me finish?

1:23:23.097 --> 1:23:25.166
I'm grateful

1:23:25.199 --> 1:23:26.834
that chance was kind enough

1:23:26.867 --> 1:23:29.771
to let us have these
last few moments together.

1:23:45.786 --> 1:23:47.322
Alpha Waymond?

1:23:48.089 --> 1:23:49.924
Alpha Waymond?

1:23:49.957 --> 1:23:52.126
What happened?

1:23:52.159 --> 1:23:54.496
Was I Raccoon Waymond again?

1:23:57.565 --> 1:23:59.400
Raccoon Waymond is dead.

1:24:03.070 --> 1:24:04.873
Is that Raccoon Joy?

1:24:05.873 --> 1:24:07.342
Am I getting it?

1:24:09.510 --> 1:24:11.446
I can to stop you, Jobu...

1:24:11.479 --> 1:24:14.749
now that I am reaching
my full potential.

1:24:14.782 --> 1:24:17.285
Oh, you still can't see
what's happening.

1:24:17.318 --> 1:24:19.387
No, I see clearly.

1:24:19.420 --> 1:24:22.924
More clearly than ever before.

1:24:38.105 --> 1:24:40.408
Oh, my God! Evelyn.

1:24:41.709 --> 1:24:42.977
Oh, my God!

1:24:44.879 --> 1:24:47.682
Damn it. So close.

1:24:47.715 --> 1:24:50.918
Evelyn? Evelyn?

1:24:50.951 --> 1:24:52.654
Please help her.

1:24:53.454 --> 1:24:55.824
I'll see you again soon.

You... you can't tell anyone.

1:26:27.848 --> 1:26:30.851
She's seen too much.
You know what that means.

1:26:30.884 --> 1:26:33.154

1:27:16.530 --> 1:27:18.266
I... I'm late.

I can think of whatever nonsense
I want and somewhere...

1:27:44.358 --> 1:27:46.060
I did it.

1:27:46.093 --> 1:27:47.762
Huh?

1:27:53.767 --> 1:27:55.469
Don't forget these cookies.

1:27:55.502 --> 1:27:57.272
Miss Deirdre really likes them.

1:28:28.235 --> 1:28:29.771
Come on.

1:28:36.677 --> 1:28:39.347
Hi, Mrs Wang.

1:28:39.380 --> 1:28:40.981
Hey, Mom.
So, about this morning...

1:28:41.014 --> 1:28:42.750
- Enough with your tricks.
- What?

1:28:42.783 --> 1:28:44.060
- I know you're in there.
- Whoa.

1:28:44.084 --> 1:28:45.586
- Get out of my daughter.
- OK!

1:28:45.619 --> 1:28:47.221
Mom, are you already drunk?

1:28:51.358 --> 1:28:53.361
- Hey, Becky.
- Mmm-hmm?

1:28:54.528 --> 1:28:57.265
Can you go help my dad
with the party?

1:28:59.133 --> 1:29:00.634
Now?

1:29:00.667 --> 1:29:02.737
- Yeah.
- Go, Becky.

1:29:02.770 --> 1:29:04.538
Go. Go.

1:29:07.107 --> 1:29:08.776
Thanks, babe.

1:29:12.746 --> 1:29:14.882
You see it all, don't you?

1:29:19.553 --> 1:29:22.523
You can see

1:29:22.556 --> 1:29:24.392
how everything...

1:29:25.526 --> 1:29:27.762
is just a random rearrangement

1:29:27.795 --> 1:29:32.166
of particles
in a vibrating superposition.

1:29:37.671 --> 1:29:40.074
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

1:29:40.107 --> 1:29:42.276
But I can do this.

1:29:43.710 --> 1:29:45.179
Huh?

1:29:45.212 --> 1:29:47.581
But you see...

1:29:47.614 --> 1:29:49.784
how everything we do...

1:29:49.817 --> 1:29:51.619
Huh?

1:29:53.654 --> 1:29:55.923
Gets washed away in a sea

1:29:55.956 --> 1:29:58.292
of every other possibility?

1:30:02.362 --> 1:30:03.965
You're everywhere.

1:30:06.233 --> 1:30:07.802
You're like me.

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:09.904
That's right.

1:30:09.937 --> 1:30:12.573
I'm the one you're looking for.

1:30:12.606 --> 1:30:15.109
I'm the one
who's going to defeat you.

1:30:15.142 --> 1:30:17.011
OK.

1:30:19.012 --> 1:30:20.748
Hit me.

1:30:22.549 --> 1:30:24.152
Punch my face.

1:30:32.793 --> 1:30:34.361
Oh...

1:30:34.394 --> 1:30:36.430
Oh! Ow! Ow!

1:30:36.463 --> 1:30:39.200
- Oh, stop!
- Wow.

1:30:41.335 --> 1:30:43.404
Hi, Dad.

1:30:45.772 --> 1:30:48.909
We're... we're just practising
karaoke for tonight.

1:30:48.942 --> 1:30:50.978
♪ La-la-la! ♪

1:30:52.346 --> 1:30:54.014
I will take care of it!

1:30:54.047 --> 1:30:56.116
- She'll take care of it, Dad.
- Go.

1:30:56.149 --> 1:30:57.351
- Honey, you OK?
- It's OK.

1:30:57.384 --> 1:30:59.653
- Go!
- Yeah, I just fell on the couch.

1:30:59.686 --> 1:31:01.155
Go!

1:31:01.188 --> 1:31:02.757
OK.

1:31:04.258 --> 1:31:05.826
Oh.

1:31:05.859 --> 1:31:07.462
- Ow...
- He's so sweet.

1:31:09.263 --> 1:31:11.265
OK.

1:31:11.298 --> 1:31:12.967
Hey, hey, buddy!

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:17.271
If you don't want
to fight me, then...

1:31:17.304 --> 1:31:18.973
- Why?
- Why what?

1:31:19.006 --> 1:31:20.841
What... what's all this for?

1:31:22.843 --> 1:31:25.379
Why was I looking for you?

1:31:25.412 --> 1:31:26.981
Yeah.

1:31:30.484 --> 1:31:32.186
Sit down.

1:31:32.953 --> 1:31:34.722
Sit down, grab a snack,

1:31:34.755 --> 1:31:36.590
make yourself comfortable, huh?

1:31:36.623 --> 1:31:39.093
- Oh, hey, you OK?
- OK.

1:31:40.527 --> 1:31:43.531
Mmm. We can speed this up.

1:31:43.564 --> 1:31:46.867
Sit on the crack.

1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:49.169
Sit on the crack
of the couch, OK?

1:31:49.202 --> 1:31:50.404
Get comfortable.

1:32:01.682 --> 1:32:03.350
Bagel.

1:32:06.687 --> 1:32:09.123
Please, I don't care
about the bagel.

1:32:09.156 --> 1:32:11.025
I don't care
about the Alphaverse.

1:32:11.058 --> 1:32:12.860
I only care about my Joy.

1:32:12.893 --> 1:32:14.128
Give me back my daughter

1:32:14.161 --> 1:32:15.796
and I'll leave you
alone forever.

1:32:15.829 --> 1:32:18.299
Sorry! No can do.

1:32:18.332 --> 1:32:19.433
Why not?

1:32:19.466 --> 1:32:22.136
I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

1:32:22.169 --> 1:32:26.907
Every version of Joy
is Jobu Tupaki.

1:32:26.940 --> 1:32:29.510
- You can't separate us.
- No.

1:32:29.543 --> 1:32:34.181
I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

1:32:37.918 --> 1:32:41.522
And I know the joy...

1:32:42.923 --> 1:32:45.927
and the pain of having you
as my mother.

1:32:47.694 --> 1:32:50.230
Then you know I would do...

1:32:50.263 --> 1:32:54.402
Only do the right thing
for her, for you.

1:32:55.402 --> 1:32:59.440
'Right' is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid

1:32:59.473 --> 1:33:03.444
and I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

1:33:06.413 --> 1:33:07.982
Mom...

1:33:08.015 --> 1:33:09.917
No, it's not like that.

1:33:09.950 --> 1:33:11.552
It's Gong Gong.

1:33:11.585 --> 1:33:12.886
He's a different generation.

1:33:12.919 --> 1:33:15.356
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

1:33:15.389 --> 1:33:17.091
You should feel relieved.

1:33:17.124 --> 1:33:20.494
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

1:33:20.527 --> 1:33:23.831
You'll be free from that box,
just like me.

1:33:23.864 --> 1:33:26.166
No, no, I'm not like you.

1:33:26.199 --> 1:33:29.536
You're young and your mind
is always changing.

1:33:29.569 --> 1:33:31.739
I still know who I am.

1:33:31.772 --> 1:33:33.974
You have no idea
what you've done.

1:33:34.007 --> 1:33:36.611
You're stuck like this forever.

1:33:38.178 --> 1:33:41.015
No, I'm going back with my Joy,

1:33:41.048 --> 1:33:44.318
to my family, to live my life.

1:33:44.351 --> 1:33:45.753
A happy life.

1:33:45.786 --> 1:33:47.755
OK.

1:33:49.790 --> 1:33:51.959
Good luck with that.

1:34:04.938 --> 1:34:06.306
Thank you so much for coming.

1:34:11.311 --> 1:34:13.547
Thank you. Thank your father.

1:34:26.993 --> 1:34:29.096
All this time...

1:34:30.564 --> 1:34:34.068
I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.

1:34:36.503 --> 1:34:40.941
I was just looking for someone
who could see what I see.

1:34:42.976 --> 1:34:46.414
Feel what I feel.

1:35:08.568 --> 1:35:10.771
And that someone...

1:35:15.008 --> 1:35:16.744
is you.

1:35:18.545 --> 1:35:20.414
Evelyn!

1:35:20.447 --> 1:35:23.284
- You're alive!
- Impossible.

1:35:27.354 --> 1:35:29.089
- Hello?
- Mrs Wang?

1:35:29.122 --> 1:35:30.524
Where... where are you?

1:35:30.557 --> 1:35:34.361
I mean, to not even show up
for your appointment?!

1:35:34.394 --> 1:35:35.629
Shut up.

1:35:35.662 --> 1:35:36.864
What did you just say?

1:35:36.897 --> 1:35:38.766
I said shut up.

1:35:38.799 --> 1:35:40.267
You don't matter.

1:35:40.300 --> 1:35:42.336
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1:35:42.369 --> 1:35:43.637
Nothing matters.

1:35:43.670 --> 1:35:45.506
Mrs Wang!

1:35:45.539 --> 1:35:48.642
You are gonna
be in serious trouble!

1:35:48.675 --> 1:35:50.544
Do you understand?

1:35:50.577 --> 1:35:52.980
For you to disrespect...

1:36:19.005 --> 1:36:22.509
Happy New Year!

1:36:22.542 --> 1:36:24.344
Another year, hmm?

1:36:24.377 --> 1:36:26.280
Pretending we know
what we're doing,

1:36:26.313 --> 1:36:30.518
but, really, we're just going
around in circles.

1:36:31.785 --> 1:36:34.188
Doing laundry and taxes,

1:36:34.221 --> 1:36:36.257
and laundry and taxes.

1:36:44.231 --> 1:36:45.766
- No more running.
- Excuse me.

1:36:45.799 --> 1:36:48.135
Where are the owners? Oh.

1:36:48.902 --> 1:36:51.005
There you are. Mr and Mrs Wang.

1:36:51.771 --> 1:36:56.410
You have left me no option
but to authorise the seizure

1:36:56.443 --> 1:36:58.979
of your personal
and your business assets.

1:36:59.012 --> 1:37:00.781
- You have to vacate...
- Wait, Evelyn!

1:37:07.587 --> 1:37:09.756
It's just so good, you know?

1:37:09.789 --> 1:37:11.625
What are you doing? No! No!

1:37:11.658 --> 1:37:14.294
My God, Chad, I told
you she couldn't be trusted!

1:37:14.327 --> 1:37:16.397
Evelyn, please! Calm down.

1:37:17.264 --> 1:37:19.566
Within 48 hours or...

1:37:27.807 --> 1:37:29.476
Everything...

1:37:32.746 --> 1:37:34.014
Ugh!

1:37:39.853 --> 1:37:41.622
What are you doing?

1:37:47.627 --> 1:37:50.097
Not a single moment will go by

1:37:50.130 --> 1:37:51.965
without every other universe

1:37:51.998 --> 1:37:54.335
screaming for your attention.

1:37:56.736 --> 1:37:58.872
Never fully there.

1:37:58.905 --> 1:38:01.475
Just a lifetime of...

1:38:01.508 --> 1:38:02.910
No, no!

1:38:02.943 --> 1:38:04.111
Fractured moments.

1:38:04.144 --> 1:38:06.013
Raccaccoonie!

1:38:06.046 --> 1:38:08.715
Contradictions and confusion...

1:38:08.748 --> 1:38:10.851
- Get off me!
- Chad, don't forget about me.

1:38:10.884 --> 1:38:12.319
Here are the papers.

1:38:12.352 --> 1:38:16.557
- Oh! Oh, officer?
- OK, OK.

1:38:23.830 --> 1:38:25.666
With only a few specks of time

1:38:25.699 --> 1:38:28.936
where anything
actually makes any sense.

1:38:31.237 --> 1:38:34.508
I've always hated this place.

1:38:40.981 --> 1:38:42.516
Raccaccoonie!

1:38:42.549 --> 1:38:44.084
Chad!

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:49.690
Get off me! Get off!

1:39:01.301 --> 1:39:03.737
Evelyn, why?!

1:42:11.457 --> 1:42:14.394
Do you know why
I actually built the bagel?

1:42:15.428 --> 1:42:18.665
It wasn't to destroy everything.

1:42:19.566 --> 1:42:22.035
It was to destroy myself.

1:42:23.036 --> 1:42:27.107
I wanted to see if I went in,
could I finally escape?

1:42:29.275 --> 1:42:31.645
Like, actually die.

1:42:34.113 --> 1:42:36.150
At least this way...

1:42:37.317 --> 1:42:39.153
I don't have to do it alone.

1:42:45.491 --> 1:42:47.160
You're not listening.

1:42:47.193 --> 1:42:49.062
This is out of my league...

1:42:49.095 --> 1:42:51.331
Judge Brenner signed...

1:42:54.634 --> 1:42:58.038
Well, excuse me!
Excuse me, Mr Wang.

1:42:58.071 --> 1:42:59.982
Every person I know
is going through a hard time.

1:43:00.006 --> 1:43:02.910
- It's a hard time...
- Evelyn!

1:43:06.112 --> 1:43:07.915
Come back.

1:43:12.552 --> 1:43:15.088
My silly husband.

1:43:15.121 --> 1:43:18.225
Probably making things worse.

1:43:18.258 --> 1:43:20.027
Ignore it.

1:43:25.298 --> 1:43:27.534
OK, you can let her go.

1:43:28.801 --> 1:43:33.607
You, let her go. It's OK. Yes!

1:43:35.375 --> 1:43:37.010
Thank you.

1:43:52.358 --> 1:43:55.095
How? That's impossible.

1:43:55.128 --> 1:43:57.631
It's just
a statistical inevitability.

1:43:57.664 --> 1:43:59.733
It's nothing special.

1:44:08.341 --> 1:44:10.010
I don't know.

1:44:10.043 --> 1:44:12.079
I just talked to her.

1:44:52.952 --> 1:44:54.221
Please!

1:44:58.458 --> 1:44:59.693
Please!

1:44:59.726 --> 1:45:02.662
Can we...
can we just stop fighting?

1:45:17.410 --> 1:45:18.745
I know you are all fighting

1:45:18.778 --> 1:45:22.115
because you're scared
and confused.

1:45:24.050 --> 1:45:26.053
I'm confused too.

1:45:29.489 --> 1:45:31.058
All day...

1:45:32.592 --> 1:45:35.162
I don't know
what the heck is going on.

1:45:36.229 --> 1:45:38.765
But somehow...

1:45:39.699 --> 1:45:42.102
this feels like
it's all my fault.

1:45:57.850 --> 1:46:00.387
I don't know.

1:46:02.422 --> 1:46:04.324
The only thing I do know...

1:46:05.291 --> 1:46:07.394
is that we have to be kind.

1:46:12.999 --> 1:46:14.601
Please.

1:46:14.634 --> 1:46:16.269
Be kind...

1:46:17.036 --> 1:46:20.073
especially when
we don't know what's going on.

1:46:39.325 --> 1:46:40.894
Hey, Evelyn!

1:46:42.395 --> 1:46:44.030
Bagel.

1:46:46.532 --> 1:46:49.302
Evelyn...

1:46:50.903 --> 1:46:54.174
You can still turn around
and avoid all this.

1:46:54.207 --> 1:46:55.742
Please...

1:46:56.509 --> 1:46:58.044
be kind.

1:47:00.813 --> 1:47:03.616
It's too late, Waymond.

1:47:06.219 --> 1:47:08.088
Don't say that.

1:47:27.573 --> 1:47:29.909
Did you see that?

1:47:32.144 --> 1:47:33.646
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh!

1:47:33.679 --> 1:47:35.281
- Huh! Found it!
- Check this!

1:47:35.314 --> 1:47:37.817
What song is this?

1:47:40.887 --> 1:47:43.189
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

1:47:44.557 --> 1:47:46.092
That's very funny.

1:47:46.926 --> 1:47:48.728
- Yeah, that's it?
- Yeah!

1:48:48.087 --> 1:48:49.656
I'm sorry too.

1:49:21.287 --> 1:49:23.189
Oh!

1:49:24.590 --> 1:49:27.427
So cute!

1:49:27.460 --> 1:49:29.529
Come on, Evelyn.

1:49:30.496 --> 1:49:32.032
Come on.

1:49:35.768 --> 1:49:37.303
Oh.

1:49:37.336 --> 1:49:39.272
I get it.

1:49:42.441 --> 1:49:44.411
Feeling a good thing.

1:49:45.645 --> 1:49:47.414
You got your hopes up.

1:49:48.314 --> 1:49:50.850
So I'm here
to save you some time.

1:49:53.653 --> 1:49:55.322
Eventually...

1:49:58.524 --> 1:50:00.093
that all just goes away.

1:50:00.126 --> 1:50:02.261
Just goes away.

1:50:02.294 --> 1:50:03.496
Come on.

1:50:34.827 --> 1:50:37.730
I don't care
if you come with me.

1:50:37.763 --> 1:50:39.532
Enjoy your life.

1:50:56.916 --> 1:50:59.052
Ugh!

1:50:59.085 --> 1:51:01.421
Evelyn! Evelyn, please!

1:51:01.454 --> 1:51:03.189
No more!

1:51:05.224 --> 1:51:07.193
I don't want to hurt you.

1:51:13.933 --> 1:51:15.735
Joy, come back with me.

1:51:15.768 --> 1:51:18.304
Joy! Joy!

1:51:28.214 --> 1:51:32.018
What did my silly husband
say to you?

1:51:33.419 --> 1:51:36.022
He told me about your situation.

1:51:37.490 --> 1:51:40.793
I remembered when my husband
served me papers.

1:51:40.826 --> 1:51:44.664
I drove his Kia Forte
through my neighbour's kitchen.

1:51:44.697 --> 1:51:46.432
Huh!

1:51:46.465 --> 1:51:48.267
But you know what I say?

1:51:48.300 --> 1:51:52.739
It's called,
"Unlovable bitches like us..."

1:51:53.806 --> 1:51:56.309
"Make the world go 'round."

1:52:04.083 --> 1:52:06.052
Don't stop playing.

1:52:06.085 --> 1:52:08.388
Play something for me.

1:52:23.469 --> 1:52:25.371
That's not true.

1:52:28.574 --> 1:52:31.677
- You're not unlovable.
- You're not unlovable!

1:52:31.710 --> 1:52:33.780
What are you talking about?

1:52:33.813 --> 1:52:36.216
There is always
something to love.

1:52:37.283 --> 1:52:40.086
Even in a stupid,
stupid universe

1:52:40.119 --> 1:52:43.322
where we have
hot dogs for fingers,

1:52:43.355 --> 1:52:45.691
we'd get very good
with our feet.

1:53:03.576 --> 1:53:05.111
Oh!

1:53:08.714 --> 1:53:10.917
- See?
- OK.

1:53:10.950 --> 1:53:13.686
I feel nothing.

1:53:13.719 --> 1:53:17.123
I... I feel...

1:53:17.156 --> 1:53:19.025
I feel...

1:53:30.970 --> 1:53:33.472
Don't let her stop Jobu!

1:53:33.505 --> 1:53:34.874
Open fire!

1:54:29.795 --> 1:54:30.897
So stupid!

1:54:47.913 --> 1:54:49.282
Evelyn?

1:54:50.883 --> 1:54:52.251
What are you doing?

1:54:52.284 --> 1:54:56.556
I'm learning to fight like you.

1:55:38.097 --> 1:55:39.932
You know, Evelyn, my wife

1:55:39.965 --> 1:55:41.834
used to wear
that exact same perfume,

1:55:41.867 --> 1:55:43.469
God rest her soul.

1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:50.443
These are direct indications

1:55:50.476 --> 1:55:52.878
that there's some impingement
of the nervous system.

1:55:54.179 --> 1:55:55.448
With a little bit of help,

1:55:55.481 --> 1:55:58.050
we could be seeing things
nice and straight.

1:56:01.653 --> 1:56:03.289
You might feel a little sore,

1:56:03.322 --> 1:56:05.257
but everything
is looking pretty good.

1:56:05.290 --> 1:56:07.527
Thank you.

1:56:11.897 --> 1:56:13.666
Clean up in there, alright?

1:56:23.042 --> 1:56:24.377
Hah!

1:57:25.737 --> 1:57:28.074
You took everything
away from me.

1:57:28.107 --> 1:57:29.776
I'm sorry.

1:57:30.542 --> 1:57:33.379
Raccaccoonie taught me so much!

1:57:33.412 --> 1:57:35.781
I... I didn't even know

1:57:35.814 --> 1:57:37.316
how to boil an egg

1:57:37.349 --> 1:57:41.921
and he taught me
how to spin it on a spatula.

1:57:43.489 --> 1:57:45.724
I'm useless alone.

1:57:47.059 --> 1:57:49.495
We're all useless alone.

1:57:49.528 --> 1:57:51.931
It's a good thing
you're not alone.

1:57:52.898 --> 1:57:53.966
Oh!

1:57:55.501 --> 1:57:57.837
Let's go rescue
your silly raccoon.

1:57:59.538 --> 1:58:02.108
Oh, we're gonna do it!

1:58:26.265 --> 1:58:29.268
Arggh!

1:58:34.072 --> 1:58:36.308
Oh-ho-ho!

1:58:51.823 --> 1:58:53.959
Get out of the way!

1:59:09.675 --> 1:59:11.611
Waymond!

1:59:22.854 --> 1:59:24.256
See?

1:59:24.289 --> 1:59:25.858
It's only a matter of time

1:59:25.891 --> 1:59:27.626
before everything
balances itself out.

1:59:27.659 --> 1:59:29.528
- Come on, come on, come on!
- I can't.

1:59:29.561 --> 1:59:32.331
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

1:59:36.401 --> 1:59:39.138
Evelyn, let her go.

2:00:21.513 --> 2:00:24.149
But she turned out
to be stubborn,

2:00:24.182 --> 2:00:27.653
aimless, a mess.

2:00:27.686 --> 2:00:29.589
Just like her mother.

2:00:30.522 --> 2:00:32.491
But now I see.

2:00:32.524 --> 2:00:35.094
It's OK that she's a mess.

2:00:36.728 --> 2:00:39.398
Because just like me...

2:00:39.431 --> 2:00:41.167
Huh.

2:02:28.073 --> 2:02:30.275
Well, maybe you win
in this universe,

2:02:30.308 --> 2:02:32.711
but in another time...

2:02:36.681 --> 2:02:38.984
I beat you!

2:02:40.185 --> 2:02:41.353
Ohh!

2:02:41.386 --> 2:02:43.188
Or we tie!

2:02:47.859 --> 2:02:50.195
Or we just...

2:02:50.228 --> 2:02:51.764
hang around.

2:02:51.797 --> 2:02:53.732
OK, Joy, listen.

2:02:55.534 --> 2:02:56.902
Because it's all
just a pointless

2:02:56.935 --> 2:02:58.504
swirling bucket of bullshit.

2:02:58.537 --> 2:03:00.172
Huh!

2:03:01.807 --> 2:03:05.778
That bagel is where
we finally find peace, Evelyn.

2:03:08.914 --> 2:03:12.651
Stop calling me Evelyn!

2:03:24.129 --> 2:03:25.364
I

2:03:25.397 --> 2:03:27.933
Am.

2:03:27.966 --> 2:03:30.002
Your

2:03:30.035 --> 2:03:31.771
mother!

2:03:41.713 --> 2:03:43.149
Ah Ba?

2:03:49.588 --> 2:03:51.323
Seriously?

2:03:51.356 --> 2:03:53.592
Can you please just...

2:03:53.625 --> 2:03:56.228
stop?!

2:03:58.630 --> 2:04:00.466
Mom.

2:04:00.499 --> 2:04:02.935
Just... just stop.

2:04:03.735 --> 2:04:06.372
Good for you.
You're figuring your shit out.

2:04:07.806 --> 2:04:12.111
And that's great. I'm really,
really happy for you.

2:04:13.411 --> 2:04:15.281
But I'm...

2:04:16.548 --> 2:04:18.451
I'm tired.

2:04:20.619 --> 2:04:22.120
I don't want to hurt anymore.

2:04:22.153 --> 2:04:24.890
And for some reason
when I'm with you, it just...

2:04:26.925 --> 2:04:29.261
it just hurts the both of us.

2:04:32.864 --> 2:04:36.168
So let's just go
our separate ways, OK?

2:04:37.736 --> 2:04:40.239
Just let me go.

2:04:52.551 --> 2:04:54.186
OK.

2:05:29.588 --> 2:05:31.257
Wait.

2:05:38.296 --> 2:05:39.698
You are getting fat.

2:05:39.731 --> 2:05:41.099
And you never call me

2:05:41.132 --> 2:05:42.568
even though we have
a family plan.

2:05:42.601 --> 2:05:44.202
- What?
- And it's free.

2:05:44.235 --> 2:05:46.738
You only visit
when you need something.

2:05:46.771 --> 2:05:48.941
And you got a tattoo
and I don't care

2:05:48.974 --> 2:05:51.376
if it's supposed
to represent our family.

2:05:51.409 --> 2:05:52.978
You know I hate tattoos.

2:05:53.011 --> 2:05:55.747
And of all the places
I could be,

2:05:55.780 --> 2:05:58.216
why would I want
to be here with you?

2:05:58.249 --> 2:06:00.452
Yes, you're right.

2:06:00.485 --> 2:06:02.387
It doesn't make sense.

2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:03.556
Evelyn!

2:06:04.689 --> 2:06:06.392
Let her finish.

2:06:08.827 --> 2:06:10.563
Maybe it's like you said.

2:06:11.630 --> 2:06:14.266
Maybe there is
something out there,

2:06:14.299 --> 2:06:16.001
some new discovery

2:06:16.034 --> 2:06:17.603
that will make us feel

2:06:17.636 --> 2:06:20.506
like even smaller
pieces of shit.

2:06:21.640 --> 2:06:23.809
Something that explains why

2:06:23.842 --> 2:06:26.812
you still went looking for me

2:06:26.845 --> 2:06:29.315
through all of this noise.

2:06:31.549 --> 2:06:33.218
And why,

2:06:33.251 --> 2:06:35.253
no matter what,

2:06:35.286 --> 2:06:37.957
I still want
to be here with you.

2:06:39.691 --> 2:06:42.061
I will always...

2:06:43.361 --> 2:06:44.964
always...

2:06:45.730 --> 2:06:48.467
want to be here with you.

2:06:50.869 --> 2:06:53.005
So what? You...

2:06:55.940 --> 2:06:58.978
You're just gonna
ignore everything else?

2:06:59.944 --> 2:07:03.115
You could be anything, anywhere.

2:07:06.918 --> 2:07:10.022
Why not go somewhere
where your...

2:07:12.857 --> 2:07:15.361
where your daughter
is more than just...

2:07:17.028 --> 2:07:18.931
this?

2:07:20.498 --> 2:07:22.801
Here, all we get

2:07:22.834 --> 2:07:26.104
are a few specks of time

2:07:26.137 --> 2:07:29.675
where any of this
actually makes any sense.

2:07:35.447 --> 2:07:37.249
Then I will Cherish

2:07:37.282 --> 2:07:40.519
these few specks of time.

2:07:48.126 --> 2:07:50.395
You push the button.

2:07:50.428 --> 2:07:52.631
Yeah, there you go.

2:07:52.664 --> 2:07:54.399
I feel like I'm 14.

2:07:54.432 --> 2:07:56.601
Yeah.

2:07:56.634 --> 2:07:59.905
You're a crazy woman!

2:07:59.938 --> 2:08:01.673
Takes one to know one.

2:08:01.706 --> 2:08:05.210
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

2:08:05.243 --> 2:08:07.613
- What are you doing?
- Grab my hair.

This is awkward, right?

2:09:47.078 --> 2:09:49.581
Do you still want
to do your party?

2:09:50.782 --> 2:09:53.485

Mmm-hmm.

2:10:20.879 --> 2:10:22.814
That needs to go in the bag too.

2:10:22.847 --> 2:10:25.784
Taxes suck.

2:10:34.893 --> 2:10:36.829
Thank you for the ride, Becky!

- Becky?
- I'll call you after.

2:10:42.700 --> 2:10:44.536

2:10:48.206 --> 2:10:49.841
Wow.

I'll call you later!

Hurry, hurry!

2:11:01.185 --> 2:11:02.888

OK. Yes.

I am happy to say I do think

things are better.

This is... this is
an improvement.

2:11:52.337 --> 2:11:54.139
But we have a problem

2:11:54.172 --> 2:11:56.441
because you listened,
but you didn't listen

2:11:56.474 --> 2:11:58.310
and that has to do
with the Schedule C.

2:11:58.343 --> 2:12:01.379
You see, you did...
