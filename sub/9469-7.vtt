01:01.750 --> 01:04.441
We are hot, hot, hot,
you are not, not, not

01:04.471 --> 01:08.355
We are hot, hot, hot,
you are not, not, not

01:29.955 --> 01:31.129
<i>Traffic is way backed up</i>

01:31.159 --> 01:33.327
<i>all the way along the ten
beyond Clearview.</i>

01:33.357 --> 01:35.430
<i>You're probably best to stay away
from there altogether.</i>

01:35.460 --> 01:37.128
<i>Construction still holding things up
along the 90,</i>

01:37.158 --> 01:39.116
<i>so expect a few delays there as well.</i>

02:59.114 --> 03:01.588
- So...
- So?

03:01.989 --> 03:03.363
Last night.

03:03.393 --> 03:05.228
- Right.
- Was kind of...

03:05.311 --> 03:09.018
- Unexpected.
- Yeah. Definitely unexpected.

03:17.287 --> 03:19.106
What's up, buttercups?

03:23.226 --> 03:26.223
I am starving!

03:26.253 --> 03:30.091
- And craving dark, leafy greens.
- For breakfast?

03:30.675 --> 03:34.428
Doctor Spivak says we don't get
enough riboflavin in our diet.

03:34.458 --> 03:38.058
And I don't see any dark, leafy greens.

03:43.021 --> 03:45.351
So, how are we all doing today?

03:45.381 --> 03:47.926
- Good.
- Yeah, good.

03:50.052 --> 03:56.037
Oh, my God. So, I had this incredibly
fucked-up dream last night.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.629
Uh, there was...
there was this house,

03:58.659 --> 04:02.600
and there was this little boy.
And... a storm was coming in,

04:02.630 --> 04:06.946
and there were these... these windows,
these beautiful stained glass windows...

04:06.976 --> 04:10.096
And... you were there.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.648
And you were there.

04:11.678 --> 04:16.819
And there... was this guy
in this creepy mask.

04:17.427 --> 04:19.305
Oh, it scared the crap out of me.

04:19.334 --> 04:23.103
I haven't had a nightmare like that
since I was a little kid.

04:29.632 --> 04:32.576
Guys, it's the 21st century, OK?

04:32.606 --> 04:37.010
What happens between us...
among us...

04:37.040 --> 04:39.790
I think if it's more than two,
it's "among."

04:40.893 --> 04:43.760
My point is, let's not trip, OK?

04:44.397 --> 04:45.905
Yeah?

04:49.485 --> 04:50.973
Well, I should, uh...

04:51.003 --> 04:54.252
I'm gonna go say good morning to Nadia.

04:54.282 --> 04:55.853
Me, too.

04:59.537 --> 05:01.706
This'll only be weird if you
make it weird.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.114
- What the hell was that?
- No clue.

05:09.355 --> 05:11.858
She shows up at the front door,
starts nursing the baby.

05:11.941 --> 05:14.747
- Now she's sharing our dreams?
- She even saw the masks.

05:14.777 --> 05:16.749
- What the fuck is up with the mask?
- It could be shame.

05:16.779 --> 05:18.839
I mean, who wouldn't be ashamed
of doing that shit?

05:18.869 --> 05:20.883
Maybe we should tell Miranda
what's going on.

05:20.967 --> 05:23.487
- Are you out of your mind?
- She could be seeing something we're not.

05:23.517 --> 05:24.873
What, are we supposed
to just casually mention,

05:24.903 --> 05:28.176
"By the way, we got a backstage dream pass
to a serial killing spree?"

05:28.206 --> 05:30.398
She's gonna figure out
something's going on.

05:30.428 --> 05:31.561
<i>Right?</i>

05:31.591 --> 05:34.616
Maybe she could help us find that kid,
stop anyone else from getting hurt.

05:34.646 --> 05:36.962
She could get hurt.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.611
We tell her about the dreams,
where does it stop?

05:41.903 --> 05:43.920
She's gonna wind up
finding out what we are.

05:48.752 --> 05:51.646
Norman, I got a situation here.
I can't really talk right now.

05:53.539 --> 05:54.678
Hey!

05:55.149 --> 05:57.288
Fuckin' great.
What?

05:57.718 --> 06:00.108
Here's what I dreamt about
last night.

06:00.138 --> 06:02.952
And this is what came up
when I googled the image.

06:02.982 --> 06:06.682
Stained glass windows made by a guy
named Frank Bannister.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.871
This is his studio.

06:09.824 --> 06:12.583
Zebulon, Ohio.
Just across the border.

06:12.613 --> 06:15.752
You better get going,
before it's too late.

06:17.747 --> 06:20.161
You told me to come to you
when I had another dream.

06:20.191 --> 06:22.438
There was a break-in last night.
One dead, two injured.

06:22.468 --> 06:25.581
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- So I've got my hands full

06:25.611 --> 06:27.368
looking for the perpetrator,

06:27.398 --> 06:29.525
which moves dream chasing
further down my to-do list.

06:29.562 --> 06:32.347
There's a family somewhere out there
that's about to find themselves

06:32.377 --> 06:34.934
in a serious fucking shit storm.

06:34.964 --> 06:39.514
You can do something about it, like keep
it from happening, catch the murderers.

06:41.562 --> 06:42.937
Well...

06:46.226 --> 06:47.947
It isn't just me.

06:50.179 --> 06:52.749
- Roman dreamt it too.
- Roman Godfrey?

06:52.779 --> 06:57.273
The kid in Toronto who died,
Roman dreamt it too.

06:57.303 --> 06:59.025
And the time before that,
at the trailer park?

06:59.055 --> 07:01.276
That's when we realized
we were both having them.

07:01.306 --> 07:03.729
Don't ask me why.
I have no answers for any of this.

07:03.759 --> 07:07.659
- I warned you about holding out on me.
- Look, I'm here, aren't I?

07:15.629 --> 07:17.501
- I'm coming with.
- You're staying out of this.

07:17.531 --> 07:18.812
I'm in this, whether I like it or not.

07:18.842 --> 07:21.873
Last thing I need is a citizen psychic
with a rap sheet tagging along.

07:21.903 --> 07:23.496
- You gotta listen.
- Do you want to get locked up

07:23.526 --> 07:25.186
for interfering
with a police investigation?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.897
Watch it.
These guys aren't fucking around.

07:46.115 --> 07:49.089
What are you doing here, Olivia?
You have no business in this building,

07:49.119 --> 07:51.865
and you need a security pass
to come down here.

07:51.895 --> 07:52.827
What are you doing?

07:52.857 --> 07:56.407
Letting Pryce suck away your power
because it terrifies you?

07:57.593 --> 08:00.463
Norman called.
Asked me to meet him.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.252
- Goddamn it.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.982
And I told him I wasn't interested
in a family therapy session.

08:37.948 --> 08:40.410
Thank God you're all right.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.711
I... missed you.

09:01.865 --> 09:03.337
Did you just...

09:03.700 --> 09:05.117
Yep.

09:07.161 --> 09:08.948
Say something else.

09:09.857 --> 09:12.485
Roman...

09:12.568 --> 09:14.653
Say it again.

09:15.612 --> 09:18.916
Roman... you look tired.

09:19.435 --> 09:21.395
Lost sleep over you.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.238
But it's all gonna get better now.

09:29.619 --> 09:32.509
Hello, Mother.

09:35.151 --> 09:37.270
Hello, darling.

09:38.529 --> 09:40.156
What happened?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.357
Where have you been?

09:43.767 --> 09:46.229
So much to tell you.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.568
We want to hear it all.

09:59.878 --> 10:05.314
Wow.
Where were you last night?

10:05.906 --> 10:09.001
- I'm late for work.
- You slept with her again.

10:09.031 --> 10:11.137
Is it simply not possible for you
to stop thinking with your dick,

10:11.167 --> 10:13.910
- or are you just looking for punishment?
- You don't understand.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.670
She's playing you off of Roman.
She wants his money.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.073
We're all very cool with each other.

10:19.103 --> 10:21.311
Wait...

10:21.663 --> 10:26.856
I... didn't want anyone to get hurt.

10:26.886 --> 10:29.374
- I was just...
- He couldn't stand up for himself.

10:29.404 --> 10:31.583
You did what you had to do.

10:31.613 --> 10:34.639
- We have to help Jason.
- We will.

10:34.669 --> 10:35.989
You were very brave.

10:36.019 --> 10:38.075
I'm proud of what you did
for that little boy.

10:38.105 --> 10:41.655
Norman left the building.
You can cut the mommy act.

10:43.085 --> 10:46.737
I know I have not always
been demonstrative.

10:47.072 --> 10:49.658
A product of my European
upbringing, no doubt.

10:51.248 --> 10:54.546
But it doesn't mean I can't strive
to be a better mother.

10:54.576 --> 10:55.748
To both of you.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.897
- I want us to be a family.
- She hasn't changed.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.941
- This is my daughter.
- I won't watch you prey on her.

11:01.971 --> 11:03.692
- I'm comforting her.
- You're leading her on!

11:03.722 --> 11:06.225
- You never once cared about her.
- Both of you.

11:07.677 --> 11:08.977
Out.

11:21.325 --> 11:22.945
- She's gone.
- Shelley needs a break.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.397
I haven't seen my sister
in seven months.

11:24.427 --> 11:26.451
Consider the mental anguish
she's been through.

11:26.481 --> 11:29.313
- On account of Olivia.
- Both of you are toxic.

11:29.343 --> 11:32.156
Shelley is malnourished, dehydrated.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.127
She has old gunshot wounds
that still haven't healed properly,

11:35.157 --> 11:39.328
causing an infection so egregious
it's wiped out her immune system.

11:39.411 --> 11:41.551
Which is why her phosphorescence
has disappeared.

11:41.581 --> 11:43.493
And then there's
the laceration on her back.

11:43.523 --> 11:46.656
What she needs,
even more than medical attention,

11:46.686 --> 11:49.188
is a period of emotional healing,

11:49.568 --> 11:51.272
which means a peaceful environment

11:51.302 --> 11:52.956
away from the howling mobs
on the street

11:52.986 --> 11:56.952
and your endless fucking
familial dysfunction.

11:59.064 --> 12:01.480
I can't tell you how disturbing it is
you're the one responsible

12:01.518 --> 12:03.652
for my sister's peace of mind.

12:04.651 --> 12:06.750
I've been seeing to your needs
adequately, haven't I?

12:06.780 --> 12:08.341
I'm not fragile the way she is.

12:08.371 --> 12:11.344
Nobody means more to me
in this world than that girl in there.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.118
Then we at least have
one thing in common.

12:14.148 --> 12:15.614
One more thing.

12:15.698 --> 12:19.869
It's imperative you tell no one,
no one, Shelley is here.

12:20.952 --> 12:22.320
I'm not an idiot.

12:59.183 --> 13:01.154
Hey, what are you doing out of bed?

13:01.184 --> 13:02.797
I'm OK.

13:02.827 --> 13:06.299
You need to rest, OK?
Pryce says you need to rest.

13:08.833 --> 13:12.933
Look, I'm sorry you have to come back
to the same old shit with Olivia.

13:15.282 --> 13:17.553
She's... different.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.920
No, she isn't.

13:20.203 --> 13:24.203
Listen to me. She stopped thinking
about you the day you disappeared.

13:38.648 --> 13:41.598
I'm not gonna let her worm
her way back in, OK?

13:41.817 --> 13:43.841
It's too much stress on you.

13:44.530 --> 13:47.822
I'll do whatever it takes to get her
out of our lives for good.

14:06.309 --> 14:08.562
- Sorry I'm late.

14:08.592 --> 14:10.137
I don't even want to know
what you were doing.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.184
Well, then don't ask.

14:14.164 --> 14:16.803
Double homicide, Buffalo, New York.

14:16.833 --> 14:20.166
Christmas, 1965. Married couple
had their throats ripped out

14:20.196 --> 14:22.996
while their six-year-old daughter
hid in the closet.

14:23.482 --> 14:25.292
Only thing she would say
of the perpetrator

14:25.322 --> 14:27.522
was the woman had "hair of night."

14:28.412 --> 14:30.150
Why are you showing me this?

14:30.180 --> 14:33.428
Cops were able to lift a clean set
of prints from the crime scene,

14:33.458 --> 14:36.269
but there was no match.
Until today.

14:38.185 --> 14:40.874
I ran Olivia's fingerprints
through the database,

14:40.904 --> 14:43.176
and they came back to this murder.

14:43.206 --> 14:44.933
You got Olivia's fingerprints?

14:44.963 --> 14:47.394
I was trying to rule her out.
Now I can't.

14:48.278 --> 14:51.922
Wait, this happened in 1965,
for Chrissakes.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.896
I ran 'em five different times.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.136
I've got a guy at Quantico
who eyeballed them himself

14:56.166 --> 14:57.984
to preclude computer error.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.716
- I know it doesn't make any sense.
- It doesn't make any sense.

15:00.746 --> 15:03.980
- She wasn't even born.
- I don't know, 60 is the new 40.

15:04.010 --> 15:08.187
She's rich. Is it possible she's doing
some kind of experimental treatment?

15:08.217 --> 15:11.518
You would know what goes on
in that White Tower, better than anybody.

15:11.548 --> 15:16.179
This, um, this witness,
she still around?

15:17.297 --> 15:20.760
- Her address in Buffalo.
- Let's talk to her.

15:23.929 --> 15:26.093
Michael Chasseur.
I'm the new...

15:26.123 --> 15:27.916
I know who you are.

15:30.743 --> 15:32.877
I understand you might be able
to shed some light on some folks

15:32.907 --> 15:35.382
having bad accidents
that aren't accidental.

15:37.542 --> 15:38.769
You've spoken to Peter.

15:38.799 --> 15:41.876
He told me about a dream
you both had, apparently.

15:41.906 --> 15:45.044
Little kids, parents,
house with pretty windows,

15:45.350 --> 15:48.578
and some bad guys
looking to do harm.

15:48.987 --> 15:51.476
Hm. First I've ever heard
of a dream police.

15:51.506 --> 15:53.962
- So you didn't have this dream?
- I might have.

15:53.992 --> 15:57.692
But when my head hits the pillow,
I, uh, I'm dead to the world.

15:57.822 --> 15:59.669
Wake up, don't remember a thing.

15:59.699 --> 16:01.617
Some people have things
that keep them awake at night.

16:01.651 --> 16:02.941
Not me.

16:06.079 --> 16:08.374
Know anything about a home invasion?

16:09.532 --> 16:12.232
Old lady got a fatal gunshot
in her chest.

16:12.711 --> 16:15.047
Two others in critical condition.

16:15.580 --> 16:16.689
Nope.

16:18.366 --> 16:20.553
Assailant's description
is strangely similar

16:20.583 --> 16:22.638
to the one Sheriff Sworn issued
for your sister a while back...

16:22.672 --> 16:26.628
My sister's dead.
So is Sheriff Sworn.

16:27.868 --> 16:29.671
I lost a sister, too.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.755
I know what it's like.

16:32.831 --> 16:34.681
Not something you get over.

16:36.318 --> 16:37.498
Ever.

16:40.263 --> 16:42.444
So, uh...

16:42.474 --> 16:45.561
...this dream Peter told you about
give you any leads?

16:47.563 --> 16:49.398
Maybe.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.443
A house in Ohio matches the description.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.097
- Long drive.
- Yep.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.007
You want to watch out
for those speed traps.

17:04.037 --> 17:05.909
The five-oh can be real fuck-heads.

17:05.939 --> 17:07.887
But you probably get
professional courtesy.

17:07.916 --> 17:11.837
Why don't you come along?
Me being new around here.

17:12.171 --> 17:15.835
Unfortunately, I have a pressing doctor's
appointment I can't reschedule.

17:15.865 --> 17:20.022
- Hmm. Hope it's nothing serious.
- Thanks.

17:20.053 --> 17:22.117
We both have a lot
at stake in this town.

17:22.380 --> 17:24.269
I don't need to tell you
what it's been through.

17:24.299 --> 17:26.464
- Anything I can do to help.
- Well, let's make a point

17:26.494 --> 17:30.259
of getting together... figure
where things went so terribly wrong.

17:30.289 --> 17:32.385
- Sounds like a plan.
- When?

17:32.415 --> 17:34.887
We'll call you.
We'll call your office.

17:34.917 --> 17:35.935
I'll expect to hear from you.

17:35.965 --> 17:38.630
Yeah. OK. Good.

17:40.337 --> 17:44.507
Three, two, one...

17:44.537 --> 17:47.405
Blastoff! Whoa!

17:49.649 --> 17:53.405
Julian. Front and center.
It's time for your allergy shot.

17:53.442 --> 17:55.719
I can't move. I'm dead.

17:56.156 --> 17:58.606
There's a Fruit Roll-Up
in it for you.

18:00.142 --> 18:02.421
Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

18:17.961 --> 18:21.060
My breakthrough in extrauterine
fetal incubation involved

18:21.090 --> 18:24.874
an artificial umbilical vein
conducting atmospheric oxygen

18:24.904 --> 18:27.774
and a fluorocarbon mixture
through the ductus venosus

18:27.804 --> 18:31.575
to the inferior vena cava to maintain
lung inflation at amniotic pressures...

18:31.605 --> 18:34.244
You want... to show me something?

18:36.822 --> 18:38.986
Well, I was going to present this
at the Ectogenesis Convention

18:39.016 --> 18:40.696
in Stockholm next week,

18:40.726 --> 18:43.018
but now I've found
a cause even greater.

18:43.428 --> 18:45.493
Shelley, this is the new you.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.615
Her cerebral tissue is
undifferentiated,

18:56.891 --> 19:00.073
so I can map your brain's
neuro-network onto it,

19:00.103 --> 19:03.307
effectively uploading
your consciousness.

19:03.389 --> 19:07.435
Finally you'll enjoy
a normal human form.

19:08.686 --> 19:11.773
This... my body?

19:12.649 --> 19:13.984
Yes.

19:17.577 --> 19:23.160
I... mmm...
assumed this would be good news.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.805
Quite the pad.

19:48.835 --> 19:51.588
Must be a great place to play house.

19:52.714 --> 19:55.383
Yep, that's my evil master plan,

19:55.767 --> 19:59.521
become a housewife and conquer the world
one casserole at a time.

20:00.354 --> 20:03.482
I thought you were all about a payday,
but I guess you're just one of those girls

20:03.512 --> 20:06.444
who needs to be the center of attention,
no matter how many guys are involved.

20:06.474 --> 20:09.074
I don't see how
any of that concerns you.

20:09.255 --> 20:12.646
As we discussed, I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you smash my cousin's heart

20:12.676 --> 20:16.026
into a million pieces
just so you can get double dipped.

20:19.132 --> 20:21.801
Get out.
Go, leave, goodbye.

20:25.221 --> 20:27.102
Give me your fucking hands.

20:27.132 --> 20:29.633
The palms of your hands,
I need to see them now!

20:51.544 --> 20:53.370
Oh, my God.
What the hell was that?

20:53.400 --> 20:56.815
- You need to get out of here, now.
- What?

20:57.103 --> 20:59.814
You felt it, the dark energy.
You're in danger.

20:59.844 --> 21:04.689
The only dark energy here is you,
showing up at the door, talking trash,

21:04.719 --> 21:07.693
grabbing me with your cold, clammy hands,
and freaking me the fuck out.

21:07.723 --> 21:10.100
If you don't want to believe me,
trust your own feelings.

21:10.684 --> 21:12.206
This is a dangerous place,

21:12.236 --> 21:16.448
and you need to get away from here,
Miranda. I mean it. Go.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.030
You are nothing
if not a drama queen, Roman.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.057
An invoice from a moving company?

22:54.087 --> 22:56.600
You sent them
to my cottage to evict me?

22:56.630 --> 22:58.287
Your cottage?

22:58.317 --> 23:00.204
Technically, everything
on these grounds belongs to me.

23:00.234 --> 23:02.082
Technically, I can't be evicted
from a hospital,

23:02.112 --> 23:04.318
which this place is, after all,
unless a medical doctor

23:04.348 --> 23:05.282
releases me from treatment.

23:05.312 --> 23:07.353
I'll get Pryce to sign off
on your discharge.

23:07.383 --> 23:09.537
Oh, God.

23:15.930 --> 23:19.514
Can we just stop this ceaseless
pissing contest, please?

23:20.524 --> 23:24.643
Whether you believe me or not, I really
have been taking stock of my life, and...

23:24.726 --> 23:27.813
...realize I need to make amends for...

23:27.996 --> 23:30.874
...so many of the things I've done,
as well as all the things I didn't do,

23:30.957 --> 23:35.670
which could have made your life
and Shelley's... happier.

23:36.588 --> 23:38.422
Happier.

23:38.706 --> 23:42.131
I'm about to get wheeled in there
and have needles shoved into my eyeballs.

23:42.161 --> 23:45.083
You have no idea
how much more appealing that is

23:45.113 --> 23:47.543
than listening to you prattle on
with your filthy lies.

23:47.573 --> 23:49.701
Don't do this to yourself.

23:51.328 --> 23:54.039
Hard to imagine you could fuck up Shelley
more than you already have,

23:54.122 --> 23:56.666
but you're still at it.

23:56.749 --> 24:01.030
You come to my house when I told you
to stay away from my family.

24:02.113 --> 24:04.169
You and your family won't
make it without me.

24:04.199 --> 24:06.521
You need me to show the way.

24:06.551 --> 24:09.867
One more treatment after this,
I'm human.

24:09.897 --> 24:11.681
I'll be nothing like you.

24:12.424 --> 24:16.006
And when my daughter is old enough,
she'll get the treatments too.

24:16.036 --> 24:18.108
No, no, no, you can't.
You cannot do that.

24:18.138 --> 24:21.766
Mutilate my granddaughter?
Roman, that... that would be cruel.

24:21.796 --> 24:22.653
It could even kill her.

24:22.683 --> 24:25.312
Anything to get your blood
out of her veins.

24:26.205 --> 24:29.333
She'll be like me, like JR.

24:29.415 --> 24:32.456
What, you mean weak,
indecisive, suicidal?

24:32.486 --> 24:35.738
He chose a bullet in the head
over being married to you.

24:35.768 --> 24:37.740
What does that say?

24:38.658 --> 24:41.535
Because of you,
I never knew my father.

24:45.857 --> 24:48.045
JR's not your father.

24:48.401 --> 24:50.128
What?

24:50.443 --> 24:52.043
Didn't have it in him.

24:57.286 --> 24:59.996
I know you've always considered him
the genius behind Godfrey Industries,

25:00.080 --> 25:04.275
because that's the company line,
and I didn't want to spoil your fantasy.

25:05.544 --> 25:08.594
But JR's only genius was
recognizing it in others.

25:08.905 --> 25:11.765
He met a brilliant
medical student one summer

25:11.795 --> 25:14.230
in Greenwich Village in a bathhouse,

25:14.260 --> 25:17.999
and an even more brilliant woman
on the stage in London.

25:18.575 --> 25:21.430
Pryce and I made the company what it is.

25:21.460 --> 25:24.296
None of it would be here without me.

25:24.679 --> 25:27.077
JR couldn't have created any of this,

25:27.107 --> 25:29.567
let alone give me proper children.

25:36.174 --> 25:39.094
That means... Letha...

25:51.528 --> 25:52.967
How does it feel to be human?

27:40.022 --> 27:41.636
What'd you find out?

27:41.666 --> 27:43.687
That I'm getting played.

27:43.717 --> 27:46.725
What? You couldn't find
Bannister's studio?

27:46.755 --> 27:50.929
Oh, I found it, abandoned,
windows busted out.

27:50.959 --> 27:52.889
Well, then there's a mistake.
It's gotta be a different house.

27:52.919 --> 27:56.518
Or you had me chasing ghosts
to get me out of town.

27:56.548 --> 27:58.694
Why would...
I wanted to go to Ohio with you...

27:58.724 --> 28:00.922
I don't know what games
you're playing, son,

28:00.952 --> 28:03.325
but you better come correct with me.

28:03.355 --> 28:07.317
You don't, Jesus already knows
he can't help you.

28:19.912 --> 28:21.581
Shit.

28:25.643 --> 28:28.200
The reason your man in a hurry
for be somewhere is because

28:28.230 --> 28:31.535
your man have a wife somewhere.

28:31.565 --> 28:33.402
Talk to you later.

28:35.169 --> 28:37.241
Can barely chew her food.

28:37.271 --> 28:40.662
Hears good, though, on account she grunts
when you ask her a question.

28:40.692 --> 28:43.111
But me don't really know
how much help she can be.

28:43.286 --> 28:46.122
- How long has she been like this?
- Ever since we know her.

28:48.467 --> 28:50.760
You have visitors, honey.

28:50.943 --> 28:53.071
Been downhill ever since her last stroke.

28:53.304 --> 28:54.634
We'll make it brief.

28:54.664 --> 28:58.877
You're going want to.
Someone needs a fresh diaper.

28:59.310 --> 29:02.772
Me ever get like that,
put a bullet right here, sir.

29:09.045 --> 29:11.506
Hi, Donna.

29:11.590 --> 29:14.718
My name's Dr. Godfrey,
and this is Leticia.

29:15.593 --> 29:17.596
These are for you.

29:17.679 --> 29:19.889
We would like to ask you
some questions

29:19.919 --> 29:22.642
about what you saw the night
your parents were murdered.

29:24.810 --> 29:28.314
I know it's something
you'd rather not think about, but...

29:29.190 --> 29:31.693
But we need help finding
whoever's responsible,

29:31.776 --> 29:34.362
even after all these years.

29:35.845 --> 29:38.908
Do you remember telling the police
you saw who did it?

29:40.031 --> 29:41.455
Huh?

29:41.669 --> 29:44.234
You were a little girl, I know, but...

29:44.264 --> 29:48.115
...you told them that you saw a woman.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.607
Do you see the woman
in the picture here?

29:55.567 --> 29:57.235
Donna?

30:08.426 --> 30:09.789
Donna? Which one is it?

30:12.280 --> 30:14.242
Donna, Donna, it's OK.

30:14.272 --> 30:17.213
- It's OK.

30:17.297 --> 30:19.841
What the hell?
I think you need to go.

30:19.924 --> 30:22.552
Let's go. I'm sorry. Sorry.

30:38.547 --> 30:40.506
Lord Jesus!

30:57.848 --> 30:59.631
We need to go
to the sheriff with this.

30:59.714 --> 31:03.468
A ghost story from 50 years ago,
scrawled in shit by some mental patient?

31:03.498 --> 31:06.065
You don't seriously believe
that implicates Olivia, do you?

31:06.095 --> 31:07.597
No, but it might exonerate you.

31:08.114 --> 31:09.474
Uh, you lost me.

31:09.558 --> 31:12.143
Suppose Marie turns up dead.

31:13.029 --> 31:16.224
I'm sorry, but that's a possibility
that we need to confront.

31:16.254 --> 31:19.484
Foul play's involved, no other suspects.
The first person they'll go after is you.

31:19.688 --> 31:22.341
- Oh, come on.
- Ninety-eight percent of the time,

31:22.371 --> 31:24.656
it's the hubby, the ex
or the BF who did the dirty deed.

31:24.739 --> 31:26.796
There's not one shred of truth.

31:26.826 --> 31:29.213
Truth has nothing to do
with a jury trial.

31:29.243 --> 31:31.799
As cockamamie as it may sound,
a dark-haired, bloodthirsty,

31:31.829 --> 31:34.108
age-defying vixen creates
a reasonable doubt

31:34.138 --> 31:35.970
that at least
one idiot juror will buy into.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.972
- No.
- Norman, you're my client.

31:38.002 --> 31:40.725
- I'm trying to protect...
- I said no. I won't allow it.

31:40.755 --> 31:42.844
Well, as an investigator
who's licensed by the state,

31:42.874 --> 31:46.064
I have an affirmative responsibility
to provide any and all information

31:46.094 --> 31:50.027
regarding the commission of a crime,
whether I have your OK or not.

31:50.057 --> 31:52.475
I'd hate to get on your bad side.

31:52.505 --> 31:55.416
I don't have a bad side.
I'm just Dominican.

31:58.492 --> 32:01.946
Shelley.
What are you doing?

32:03.668 --> 32:05.697
Hemlock Grove.

32:05.980 --> 32:09.609
Peaceful... from a distance.

32:10.838 --> 32:13.249
Come away from there.
It's dangerous.

32:13.658 --> 32:17.241
No... it's no good.

32:17.991 --> 32:19.619
What?

32:20.719 --> 32:23.873
I shouldn't have come back.

32:23.957 --> 32:27.418
Everyone would be... better.

32:27.998 --> 32:29.619
That's not true.

32:30.064 --> 32:33.353
Do you know how much happiness
you've brought?

32:33.842 --> 32:38.292
You are alive, against all odds.

32:38.471 --> 32:40.849
And you are with the people
who love you.

32:41.703 --> 32:45.318
I... put everyone in danger.

32:45.852 --> 32:48.920
You all will get in trouble.

32:49.543 --> 32:53.608
You don't have to worry about anyone.
Everyone will be fine.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.532
And you'll be safe...
in your new body.

32:59.234 --> 33:01.995
I have taken care of everything.

33:02.025 --> 33:05.373
No one will know,
not if you don't want them to.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.792
New body...

33:07.876 --> 33:10.127
Can't do it.

33:10.410 --> 33:13.297
Why not?

33:14.515 --> 33:19.342
The girl is a person,
has a soul.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.347
What makes you think that?

33:21.758 --> 33:23.725
We talked.

33:24.265 --> 33:26.139
That's impossible.

33:26.513 --> 33:28.576
Not words.

33:28.896 --> 33:33.192
I know how to talk without words.

33:33.453 --> 33:37.405
Everyone thinks I'm a killer.

33:37.764 --> 33:40.684
This would make me one.

33:44.035 --> 33:46.455
Before you make any final decisions...

33:47.582 --> 33:49.625
...may I show you something?

33:55.740 --> 33:58.104
What do you call a fish
with no eyes?

33:59.706 --> 34:02.388
What do you call
a fish with no eyes?

34:04.044 --> 34:05.266
A "fsh."

34:07.022 --> 34:11.300
Oh, that's joy.
Now, let's try something different.

34:13.857 --> 34:16.402
How did you feel
when you were being chased?

34:18.829 --> 34:20.614
- That's fear.

34:20.645 --> 34:23.952
Now, you met a friend, Jason.
What did you think of his father?

34:26.889 --> 34:28.563
That's anger.

34:28.594 --> 34:31.817
Well, I'm sure he's probably
in protective custody.

34:33.543 --> 34:37.380
Now let's try it again... with her.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.056
I want you to feel
the same emotions again.

34:45.806 --> 34:49.473
This time, the replacement body
will be emulating your behavior.

34:50.347 --> 34:52.772
Now, think of something
that gives you joy.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.990
Now think of something
that makes you frightened.

35:04.909 --> 35:07.161
Think of something
that makes you angry.

35:07.447 --> 35:09.339
See? Nothing.

35:09.369 --> 35:10.860
It's a neuro-muscular response,

35:10.890 --> 35:13.977
devoid of any feeling, emotion,
or meaning.

35:14.059 --> 35:15.687
Like a machine.

35:16.227 --> 35:17.850
Shelley is endowed with a soul.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.134
Not so this tissue structure,
however well engineered.

35:24.904 --> 35:28.964
We would be mapping you, Shelley,
onto a blank slate.

35:29.427 --> 35:31.222
Now, does this offer any clarification

35:31.252 --> 35:33.421
on what you'll be dealing with?

35:36.754 --> 35:40.887
If you like, we could start uploading
as early as tomorrow.

35:46.308 --> 35:50.358
Why don't you get some rest
while I begin to prep the transfer?

36:37.277 --> 36:40.212
Have you ever seen
a dream book before?

36:40.242 --> 36:43.327
When we have dreams, we're basically
receiving messages from beyond.

36:43.357 --> 36:46.902
And the images in those dreams
correlate to certain numbers.

36:47.837 --> 36:50.610
- Why?
- They just do.

36:50.978 --> 36:53.601
So, let's say I dreamt
about rabbits last night.

36:53.631 --> 36:55.826
I would look up "rabbit" under "R."

36:55.856 --> 36:59.164
And the corresponding number
to "rabbit" is...

37:00.624 --> 37:02.873
thirty-nine.
So 39 would be my lucky number

37:02.903 --> 37:05.574
if I wanted to play the lotto,
for instance.

37:05.604 --> 37:07.585
Because it came to you
in a message from beyond?

37:07.615 --> 37:10.757
Exactly. So, what did you
dream about last night?

37:10.787 --> 37:12.023
Me?

37:12.053 --> 37:13.471
Yeah, you were telling us
about the dream you had.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.181
Uh, right.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.065
I heard on the radio that there's gonna be
this lottery drawing tonight.

37:21.095 --> 37:24.994
It's like the biggest jackpot ever.
It might be your lucky day, so...

37:25.024 --> 37:26.942
You said something about a boy?

37:27.843 --> 37:30.888
- On a swing.
- Swing. Great.

37:31.358 --> 37:34.058
Great. Anything else?

37:34.500 --> 37:37.629
- No detail is too small.
- Um...

37:37.860 --> 37:41.306
He was saying something
about being hot.

37:42.463 --> 37:45.027
Um, but he only had on a T-shirt.

37:45.057 --> 37:47.529
With a red devil on it. Um...

37:48.381 --> 37:50.870
Pitchfork, horns...

37:50.900 --> 37:53.194
And a storm was coming.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.990
That's good. What else?

37:58.047 --> 37:59.374
This is stupid.

38:00.409 --> 38:02.974
There is nothing stupid
about a million-dollar quick-pick.

38:03.004 --> 38:04.726
Well, first Destiny comes in here
and starts having visions...

38:04.756 --> 38:05.699
What?

38:05.729 --> 38:07.708
...and now you're harassing me
about lucky rabbits.

38:07.738 --> 38:09.935
- No, I'm just...
- Something's up,

38:09.965 --> 38:13.039
and I wanna know what it is.

38:42.790 --> 38:44.702
What's going on?

38:46.455 --> 38:48.578
You don't want to know.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.518
You sent the fucking sheriff after me?

38:52.811 --> 38:56.181
He's gonna help us.

38:57.952 --> 39:00.202
It's in the dreams.
It's gotta be in the dreams.

39:00.232 --> 39:04.832
The boy in Miranda's version...
in a shirt with a devil on it,

39:05.254 --> 39:07.315
said something about being hot.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.045
Maybe the kid worships Satan in hell.

39:14.467 --> 39:15.579
Or plays baseball.

39:15.609 --> 39:18.849
"Our team is red hot.
Your team is all shot.

39:18.879 --> 39:22.002
We're hot, hot, hot.
You're not, not, not."

39:22.032 --> 39:23.846
That's the team cheer
for the Hemlock Diablos, right?

39:23.876 --> 39:25.798
Mascot's a horned devil with a pitchfork.

39:25.828 --> 39:27.550
He's on the fucking Little League team.

39:27.580 --> 39:30.121
That family's in Hemlock Grove.

39:34.569 --> 39:40.284
Does this mean that you are ready
for one hand to wash the other?

39:40.368 --> 39:43.080
I spent the afternoon
strolling the grounds.

39:43.110 --> 39:45.831
The birch trees are beautiful in winter.

39:45.914 --> 39:48.495
White, naked.

39:48.525 --> 39:50.669
My son is trying to banish me.

39:50.997 --> 39:53.038
Always extreme measures with men.

39:53.068 --> 39:55.207
He has no idea what he's doing.

39:56.326 --> 39:58.627
What about little girl?

39:59.531 --> 40:01.255
What girl?

40:01.339 --> 40:05.634
Some months ago,
I'm given unidentified umbilical cord

40:05.717 --> 40:09.013
for stem cell harvest
after young mother dies.

40:09.096 --> 40:11.273
Run tests.

40:11.303 --> 40:17.183
Find mitochondrial DNA
you.

40:17.931 --> 40:22.443
Don't worry.
We women have to stick together, yes?

40:22.949 --> 40:26.047
These... these treatments,
when he's done,

40:26.077 --> 40:28.502
he plans to subject my granddaughter.

40:28.532 --> 40:30.621
He has only one treatment left.

40:30.651 --> 40:33.538
Is there a way to corrupt it?

40:33.568 --> 40:35.806
Prevent him from destroying
his true nature?

40:35.836 --> 40:38.865
Only two outcomes possible:

40:38.895 --> 40:42.580
his metabolism reverts
to normal human,

40:42.663 --> 40:47.669
or, with manipulation of formula...

40:50.159 --> 40:53.613
Procedure is extremely dangerous.

40:55.093 --> 40:58.387
Complications would not surprise
Dr. Pryce.

40:59.066 --> 41:01.968
I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

41:03.575 --> 41:06.395
Life is fragile, Mrs. Godfrey.

41:08.522 --> 41:12.183
You protect baby girl.
Become guardian.

41:12.213 --> 41:16.722
Everything, White Tower,
white birches, again belong to you.

41:16.752 --> 41:19.293
And your interest in this?

41:19.323 --> 41:23.182
Give me lab.
Pryce works for me.

41:23.212 --> 41:26.207
I will not let your progeny
destroy themselves.

41:28.112 --> 41:33.924
Nineteen-thirty. Oldest church
in the area renovated. Stained glass.

41:33.954 --> 41:36.508
- Frank Bannister, foremost craftsman.
- Jesus.

41:36.946 --> 41:38.958
- Exactly.
- Parsonage.

41:40.256 --> 41:42.640
I've got a good feeling
about this lottery.

41:43.144 --> 41:45.440
Yeah, you sure you don't want us
to pick you up a ticket?

41:59.444 --> 42:01.951
Do all boys lie? Hm?

42:07.521 --> 42:09.208
I thought these two were different.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.531
- That's quite a tale.
- A tall one at that.

42:20.561 --> 42:22.883
And this relates
to the Marie Godfrey case in what way?

42:22.913 --> 42:25.261
- It doesn't.
- Uh, may I?

42:25.291 --> 42:27.542
No one is making
any specific allegations here.

42:27.572 --> 42:30.941
We just wanted to furnish
your office with information

42:30.971 --> 42:32.859
that Mr. Godfrey became aware of

42:32.889 --> 42:34.975
that may be relevant
to your investigation.

42:35.005 --> 42:37.286
Spoken by someone who's clearly logged
more than a few hours

42:37.316 --> 42:40.264
working for criminal defense attorneys.

42:40.294 --> 42:42.698
We're sorry for wasting your time.

42:43.338 --> 42:46.245
My sister, as you may recall, worked
for the Department of Fish and Game.

42:46.275 --> 42:47.651
That was her day job.

42:47.681 --> 42:51.066
Clementine's abiding interest
and principal focus was

42:51.096 --> 42:55.304
tracking and exploring phenomena
that defy explanation.

42:55.334 --> 42:57.597
You're not seriously giving credence
to the ramblings

42:57.627 --> 43:02.963
- of some psychotic old woman who...
- Please. Sit down.

43:13.765 --> 43:15.851
Have you ever heard of upirs?

43:29.163 --> 43:31.531
There's the church.

43:33.752 --> 43:35.087
There.

43:40.901 --> 43:44.196
- Holy shit.
- Just like the dream.

44:12.580 --> 44:14.379
What do we say?

44:26.555 --> 44:28.646
Can I help you?

44:30.853 --> 44:32.372
Hey! What are you doing?

44:32.402 --> 44:33.725
Emilio!

44:33.755 --> 44:37.399
Hey! Emilio!

44:38.028 --> 44:40.325
Hey!

44:42.576 --> 44:45.031
Oh, my God! He's allergic!

44:45.061 --> 44:47.212
Help me! There are too much bees
in my room!

44:47.242 --> 44:49.360
- Help him!
- Get him out!

44:52.073 --> 44:53.992
- Was he stung?
- Get him out!

44:54.022 --> 44:56.930
He stung me!
Please! Someone help me! Hurry!

44:58.957 --> 45:00.393
Peter!

45:00.423 --> 45:02.269
- Come on!

45:02.299 --> 45:04.677
- Open the door, come on!
- Give him to me!

45:05.750 --> 45:07.886
- Peter!

45:19.565 --> 45:21.095
Peter!

45:21.125 --> 45:23.358
Don't try to do this alone!

47:05.555 --> 47:07.754
Darling, where have you been?

47:08.145 --> 47:09.426
I've had a wretched day.

47:09.456 --> 47:12.094
I kept calling, trying to reach you.

47:20.428 --> 47:22.175
Is something wrong?

47:33.870 --> 47:37.570
You have grown up so quickly.

47:38.264 --> 47:43.285
A partnership between
my brilliant work and your spirit.

47:44.597 --> 47:49.177
It's time for you
to come out into the world.

47:49.207 --> 47:51.209
Are you ready?

47:55.906 --> 48:00.677
My pride, my joy, my dear creation.

48:01.085 --> 48:04.984
You are going to make me
the most important scientist since Darwin.

48:07.492 --> 48:09.828
But there's someone
to whom I owe a debt,

48:09.912 --> 48:13.916
whose life is more important, I suppose,
than a watershed of adulation.

48:16.460 --> 48:19.797
And so I must say goodbye.

48:29.289 --> 48:32.137
"When thou dost ask my blessing,

48:32.167 --> 48:36.266
I'll kneel down
and ask of thee forgiveness.

48:36.296 --> 48:41.218
And so we'll live,
and pray, and sing,

48:41.248 --> 48:43.303
and tell old tales,

48:43.387 --> 48:46.889
and laugh at gilded butterflies."
