gonna need a bigger boat.

you can't say anything nice

12:29.900 --> 12:32.595
about anypony...
come sit by me!"

Big Mac knew if he just
covered himself in mud,

12:35.540 --> 12:37.642
the creature wouldn't
be able to see him.

12:37.712 --> 12:41.626
Fluttershy: Starlight Glimmer!
I have finished the dress!

12:41.822 --> 12:43.126
Isn't it gorgeous?

12:43.337 --> 12:44.595
What is that?

12:44.759 --> 12:46.104
You wanted me
to make a dress

12:46.150 --> 12:48.126
exactly like the
one in the book.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.673
Go make a REAL
dress out of fabric

12:51.736 --> 12:53.501
exactly like the
one in the book.

12:53.658 --> 12:57.283
Ahhhh. I see. Yes, of
course, Starlight Glimmer.

13:00.033 --> 13:04.048
Rarity! Make it BIGGER
than the one in the book.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.626
Of course, darling.
Bigger it is.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.369
[questioning squeak]

13:08.744 --> 13:11.830

in front of another pony,

asking him to love her.

instructions in the cookbook

13:24.634 --> 13:26.385
in order, Starlight Glimmer!

13:26.431 --> 13:30.501
I meant just the ONE cake! I
was only gone a few minutes!

13:30.619 --> 13:33.681
How in Equestria did you get
all of this done so fast?

13:33.931 --> 13:35.698
First I combined
three eggs, then...

13:35.744 --> 13:39.720
[muffled speaking]

13:40.072 --> 13:41.556
I think the baking
lesson is done.

Starlight Glimmer.

14:05.837 --> 14:10.783
Oh yes, this will do
nicely. A MUCH bigger dress!

14:11.048 --> 14:12.721
Applejack: It was
the best of apples;

14:12.767 --> 14:14.665
it was the worst of apples.

14:14.978 --> 14:16.017
Hey!

14:16.095 --> 14:20.533
I can handle this. It's just
magic and I know magic.

What's that?

You left the ovens on!

14:59.908 --> 15:02.580
comes a heckuva lot
of responsibility.

Aah! This can't get any worse.

15:07.844 --> 15:10.244
WHAT IS GOING ON!?

15:15.981 --> 15:18.595
I had no idea we had
spiders in the castle.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.588
I'm never sleeping again.

15:20.689 --> 15:24.095
Maybe if I had reversed the
Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria.

15:24.163 --> 15:27.181
Or maybe I added
too much Persuadere.

15:27.415 --> 15:28.487
What?

15:28.658 --> 15:31.134
You're really missing
the point here.

15:31.884 --> 15:33.924
I finally untangled
that mess of a spell

15:33.970 --> 15:37.517
and got everypony home. It
was really powerful stuff.

15:37.658 --> 15:39.619
They're gonna feel
that in the morning.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.931
Now, please try to
explain to me

15:42.056 --> 15:43.308
how in the name
of Celestia

15:43.310 --> 15:45.470
things got this
out of control?

15:45.634 --> 15:49.151
Well, it was the first time
I cast that particular spell

15:49.197 --> 15:50.557
and I didn't fully
think it through.

15:50.603 --> 15:51.790
I think I may be able to...

15:51.836 --> 15:54.009
I think you might be
missing the point here.

15:54.158 --> 15:55.205
Told ya.

15:55.251 --> 15:57.057
What made you think
that casting a spell

15:57.103 --> 15:58.526
on your friends
to do your bidding

15:58.572 --> 16:00.830
was even remotely
a good idea?

16:01.033 --> 16:04.564
Well, when you put it that
way, it sounds really bad.

16:04.728 --> 16:06.759
That's because it is really bad!

16:06.876 --> 16:08.681
Uh...

16:08.892 --> 16:12.885
Starlight. I'm not mad at
you. But I am disappointed.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.838
You've been doing so well.
I just don't understand

16:15.884 --> 16:18.361
how a friendship lesson
turned into all of this?

16:18.509 --> 16:20.587
Ugh. Fine!

16:20.714 --> 16:24.025
I've been avoiding the
friendship lessons on purpose.

16:24.173 --> 16:25.290
Why?

16:25.486 --> 16:27.362
I can cast complex spells.

16:27.408 --> 16:30.322
But baking a cake with
Pinkie Pie freaks me out.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.432
And yes I know how
ridiculous that sounds.

16:33.478 --> 16:35.001
That's why I didn't say anything.

16:35.071 --> 16:36.994
I thought if I just
kept wowing you

16:37.048 --> 16:41.337
with my magical abilities,
you might just... not notice.

16:41.556 --> 16:43.611
Baking a cake
freaks you out?

16:43.767 --> 16:47.392
Yes! Baking a cake,
sewing. All of it.

16:47.525 --> 16:49.313
What if I was bad at it?

16:49.423 --> 16:52.322
I didn't want to be a
disappointment to anypony

16:52.376 --> 16:55.517
and I ended up being a
disappointment to everypony.

16:55.634 --> 16:58.447
Starlight. Do you
think anypony cares

16:58.493 --> 16:59.790
if you can bake a cake?

16:59.931 --> 17:01.439
But the lesson...

17:01.533 --> 17:03.604
Was to get to know
Pinkie Pie better

17:03.650 --> 17:05.384
by doing something
she loves.

17:05.509 --> 17:08.944
It was a friendship lesson,
not a baking lesson.

17:09.126 --> 17:12.095
Oh. You know I think I might
have missed the point here.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.287
Told ya.

17:13.421 --> 17:15.085
So now what?

17:15.135 --> 17:18.147
Now it's time for a pretty
advanced friendship lesson.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.114
It's called apologizing.

17:21.343 --> 17:24.777
[groans]

17:24.910 --> 17:28.637
I dunno what kinda whammy
Starlight put on us,

17:28.863 --> 17:30.895
but I feel like I got
shoved through the

17:30.941 --> 17:34.027
super speedy cider
squeezy 6000.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.446
Ugh!... Tell me about it.

17:36.558 --> 17:40.450
If everypony could speak in a
whisper for the next few days,

17:40.496 --> 17:44.387
that would be delightful.
My head is thumping.

17:44.512 --> 17:47.137
I was up all night
calming the animals down.

17:47.277 --> 17:50.363
Fluttershy, please!
Not so loud.

17:50.551 --> 17:53.273
Starlight's spell made me
burn perfectly good cake!

17:53.418 --> 17:55.996
I NEVER burn cake!

17:56.191 --> 17:57.769
Starlight: Yeah, about that...

17:57.933 --> 18:00.477
Things got a little
out of hand last night.

18:00.590 --> 18:03.254
Ain't that the
understatement of the day?

18:03.449 --> 18:06.379
Tell it to the cakes, sister!

18:06.558 --> 18:10.605
Can we all PLEASE argue
at a lower volume?

18:10.793 --> 18:13.035
I really messed up.

18:13.144 --> 18:16.660
I cast the spell because I was
nervous about working with you

18:16.723 --> 18:18.199
on the friendship lessons.

18:18.340 --> 18:21.223
Well, here's a friendship
lesson for you.

18:21.418 --> 18:24.660
Don't cast spells
on your friends!

18:24.925 --> 18:27.167
Believe me; I know.

18:27.355 --> 18:30.574
What I did was wrong and
I can't take it back.

18:30.762 --> 18:33.777
You're right to be upset
and I hope one day,

18:33.957 --> 18:39.750
I can make it up to you. But
all I can say is I'm sorry.

18:39.951 --> 18:43.356
Now if you'll excuse me, I've
got to go clean the castle

18:43.402 --> 18:47.081
covered in wet cake
batter and spiders.

18:47.254 --> 18:49.383
That was a pretty
good apology.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.293
It seems like she
feels really bad.

18:52.441 --> 18:55.661
Hey, Starlight! Most of
the Apple family photos

18:55.707 --> 18:57.391
are still laying
around in the wreckage.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.355
I think I'll come along
and hunt 'em down.

18:59.415 --> 19:02.527
Oh! And I feel awful for
disturbing all of those

19:02.590 --> 19:05.723
cute little spiders and
bats. I should check on them.

19:05.816 --> 19:08.675
Ah, yes. And I left
some lovely fabric out;

19:08.879 --> 19:11.777
I should come move it to
that nice quiet library.

19:11.842 --> 19:14.237
Uh, I'll come and get
those storm clouds

19:14.324 --> 19:15.988
out of the bathroom.

19:16.089 --> 19:19.565
Fine! Somepony has to
bake a cake to honor

19:19.769 --> 19:22.387
all of the poor cakes that
sacrificed their batter

19:22.433 --> 19:24.426
in last night's tragedy.

20:13.449 --> 20:15.545
It seems your
apology went well.

[sigh] I'm just lucky to have
such understanding friends.

20:19.582 --> 20:21.294
But it's probably
going to be a while

20:21.348 --> 20:24.113
before I try to tackle those
friendship lessons again.

20:24.277 --> 20:26.965
What do you mean? You've
been doing them all day!

20:27.152 --> 20:28.621
What are you talking about?

20:28.668 --> 20:30.410
I've been cleaning
up the mess I made

20:30.463 --> 20:32.433
by totally failing at friendship.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.816
Really? But didn't I see
you sewing with Rarity?

20:35.933 --> 20:39.348
Yes, but you and Applejack did
a great job collecting

20:39.394 --> 20:41.052
those photos and putting
them in the book.

20:41.098 --> 20:42.933
Helping animals with Fluttershy,

20:43.027 --> 20:44.496
baking with Pinkie Pie.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.637
Those sound like your
assignments to me.

20:46.683 --> 20:49.980
In fact, I think there's just
one that you're missing.

20:51.121 --> 20:53.419
Sun? Check. Chairs? Check.

20:53.465 --> 20:55.841
And thanks to a simple
catadupa levitata spell,

we've got water! Is that
everything we need to chillax?

20:59.379 --> 21:00.598
Nope.

21:00.776 --> 21:03.284
No? What did I miss?

21:03.488 --> 21:04.980
Quiet.

21:05.238 --> 21:06.769
Ah. Right.

21:06.926 --> 21:11.303
Looks like you've completed
another friendship lesson.

21:11.473 --> 21:16.824
Hey! She completes the lesson
when I say she completes it.

21:17.019 --> 21:21.043
So less learning
and more chillaxing!

21:24.237 --> 21:28.378
