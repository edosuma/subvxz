Morning.

01:19.212 --> 01:20.213
You okay?

01:21.347 --> 01:23.383
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

01:24.651 --> 01:26.252
Looks like you had a late night.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.688
Well, either that or you just
got your pupils dilated.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.857
My pupils are fine, thank you.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.092
Met up with some friends,
I had a late night,

Wait a sec.

You were supposed

to meet up with me and Kasie,

but you texted me,
said you were tired

01:40.066 --> 01:41.167
and you wanted to stay in.

01:41.234 --> 01:42.836
Yeah, I got a second wind.

Aka blew us off.

Oh, welcome to the club.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.446
Supposedly.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.215
And we spend all day
together at work.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.617
Do we have to spend every second
of our lives together, too?

01:57.684 --> 01:58.785
Yes.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.587
In an odd
but perfect world, yeah.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.556
Where's Parker?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.125
He's been up in Vance's office
for quite a while now.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.027
Does he have
any of his pastries?

02:10.296 --> 02:11.397

Hey.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.034
Um...

02:15.101 --> 02:17.003
How much did you have
to drink last night?

02:17.070 --> 02:19.339
What? No, I'm not drinking.

02:19.405 --> 02:22.375
I'm just, I'm just tired.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.744
Just back it up. We're good.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.744
Okay.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.346
You got to tell me
where you got these.

02:26.412 --> 02:28.381
PARKER:
Food cart on 14th.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.183
Across from the dry cleaners.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.384
Not the cell phone repair place.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.319
Though Cell Phone Guy

02:33.386 --> 02:36.189
makes surprisingly
good gulab jamun.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.091
Why are these two
so friendly all of a sudden?

02:39.392 --> 02:41.060
Oh, uh, night shift is over.

02:41.127 --> 02:42.562
Oh, Agent Sawyer stayed late

02:42.629 --> 02:44.664
to, uh, pitch the director
a few ideas.

02:44.731 --> 02:45.832
Hmm.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.534
It's called giving 110%.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.002
You should give it a try.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.537
Well, that's physically
impossible.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.206
Thanks for breakfast,
Agent Parker.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.074
Yeah, no problem.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.576
Hey, can Big Daddy
get one of those?

02:56.643 --> 02:59.379
Sorry. Sawyer grabbed
the last one.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.713
(phone rings)

03:00.780 --> 03:02.782
Special Agent Parker.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.018
If only you'd shown up
to work on time.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.453
Guess the early bird
gets the brioche.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.355
PARKER:
All right, got it.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.790
Department of Waste Management's
got a dead sailor

03:10.857 --> 03:12.125
at the transfer station.

03:12.191 --> 03:14.227
Let's roll.

03:14.294 --> 03:17.363
You guys need an extra hand?
I'm all done here.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.831
Oh, no, we got it covered.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.867
Car is full.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.201
Too many cooks.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.636
Take a nap.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.808
So, "waste transfer station"
is just a fancy way

03:28.875 --> 03:31.077
of saying "garbage dump."

03:31.144 --> 03:33.713
Yeah, looks like it.
Smells like it, too.

03:34.981 --> 03:36.316
I'm really
beginning to regret

03:36.382 --> 03:37.717
not letting Sawyer
take my place.

03:37.784 --> 03:38.918
Careful what you wish for.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.386
What does that mean?

03:40.453 --> 03:41.421
Well, what do you
think Parker was doing

03:41.487 --> 03:42.388
with him in Vance's office?

03:42.455 --> 03:43.590
Didn't think about it.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.124
Give it a shot.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.161
New people like
to bring in more new people?

03:48.227 --> 03:49.729
I'm thinking it's
way worse than that.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.130
What could possibly be worse

03:51.197 --> 03:52.832
than you having to work
with Sawyer every day?

03:52.899 --> 03:56.302
Well, Parker has our performance
evals from last week.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.671
Maybe he's thinking of
replacing one of us.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.007
He couldn't replace McGee
if he tried.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.810
Yeah, that leaves you or me.

04:03.876 --> 04:05.244
Oh.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.680
And of course
it would be Sawyer.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.315
Whatever.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.584
I've lost a job before.

04:11.651 --> 04:12.685
"Whatever"?

04:12.752 --> 04:14.020
Life goes on.

04:17.256 --> 04:19.359
TORRES:
Yo, yo.

04:17.256 --> 04:19.359
Hey.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.994
You two get lost
on the way here?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.296
Torres needed to stop
for a coffee.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.530
Late night.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.165
JIMMY:
I bet.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.034
I can see your dilated pupils
from here, Torres.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.336
Dead body. Who is it?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.971
McGEE:
Well, this is Lieutenant
Junior Grade Kane Lantz.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.307
Worked as an I.T. specialist.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.976
Speaking of pupils,
he seems to be missing one.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.379
JIMMY:
It doesn't appear to be related
to the cause of death, though.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.347
Judging by the cyanosis,
I'd say

04:41.414 --> 04:43.216
that we're looking
at asphyxiation.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.118
Sanitation workers found him
in the back of their truck

04:45.184 --> 04:47.520
after they arrived
at the station.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.622
Yeah, could've been picked up
somewhere along their route.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.057
McGEE:
Maybe, uh,

04:51.124 --> 04:52.659
talk to the workers,
retrace the route.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.360
Maybe we can figure out
where he was dumped.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.697
Knight, talk to Lantz's CO,
see if you can find out, um,

04:57.764 --> 04:59.966
whatever there is to find out.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.367
On it.

05:01.434 --> 05:03.970
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news, but, uh,

05:04.037 --> 05:05.338
we've got a missing eyeball
that we have to...

05:05.405 --> 05:07.473
Oh, please don't
finish that sentence.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.741
...find.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.476
Probably somewhere
around here, you know,

05:10.543 --> 05:13.880
just covered
in juicy forensic evidence.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.314
Any volunteers

05:15.381 --> 05:17.350
to help look? Any takers?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.851
McGEE:
Yeah, you know what?
On second thought,

05:18.918 --> 05:21.187
Knight, I uh,
I'm gonna go talk to Lantz's CO.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.523
Uh, have fun
finding that eyeball.

05:23.589 --> 05:25.858
Are you really pulling rank
right now?

05:25.925 --> 05:27.860
It hurts me
more than it hurts you.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.729
(exhales, laughs)

05:29.796 --> 05:31.564
Uh-oh.

05:29.796 --> 05:31.564
(car horn honks)

05:31.631 --> 05:33.533
JIMMY:
What does "uh-oh" mean?

05:33.599 --> 05:35.234
It means we're about
to get screwed.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.569
You know these guys?

05:36.636 --> 05:39.572
No, but, uh,
multiple unmarked SUVs

05:39.639 --> 05:41.274
usually aren't a good sign.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.042
Let's secure the perimeter.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.777
And I want a tarp
around the body now.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.245
Excuse me.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.214
Can we help you?

05:48.281 --> 05:49.749
This is a closed crime scene.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.518
Agent Collins,
Defense Intelligence Agency.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.287
Now it's our closed crime scene.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.724
Alden Parker, NCIS.
Can I ask why?

05:57.790 --> 06:00.626
You can ask,
but the answer's classified.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.805
It's a simple question.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.775
Why is DIA messing
with our case?

06:15.842 --> 06:18.811
As Agent Collins told you,
that's classified.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.080
We got a dead Navy lieutenant.
Cut the crap.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.750
Director Vance,
I would caution your agent

06:23.816 --> 06:25.885
to remember
who he's speaking with.

06:25.952 --> 06:29.122
With all due respect, I would
like an answer to his question.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.623
You want me to say
"pretty please,"

06:30.690 --> 06:32.325
I'm more than happy
to do that, too.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.893
Or perhaps, respectfully,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.895
you could just read us in

06:35.962 --> 06:37.563
on DIA's operation.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.564
Pretty please.

06:38.631 --> 06:39.899
Respectfully.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.970
I take it by now you're aware
that Lieutenant Lantz

06:44.036 --> 06:46.405
was assigned to the Office
of Naval Intelligence.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.175
Yeah. He identified
vulnerabilities in your system,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.177
then he built patches
for the weak points.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.112
And he was damn good at it, too.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.781
Unfortunately, when DIA agents

06:54.847 --> 06:56.783
swept Lantz's apartment
this morning,

06:56.849 --> 06:59.285
they discovered his
secure laptop had gone missing.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.155
Lantz took a classified laptop
home with him?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.157
He shouldn't have,
but it happens.

07:04.223 --> 07:07.293
Perhaps with his workload and
the agencies who depend on him,

07:07.360 --> 07:08.961
he thought it was
his only option.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.329
What was on it?

07:10.396 --> 07:11.964
Descriptions of those weak spots

07:12.031 --> 07:13.933
in ONI's servers
that you mentioned.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.936
If exploited, it could
allow our enemies access

07:17.003 --> 07:18.337
to a whole range
of government systems.

07:18.404 --> 07:20.006
That's a problem.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.376
ONI uses the strongest
biometric security in existence,

07:23.442 --> 07:25.711
so, theoretically,
that laptop is only accessible

07:25.778 --> 07:27.380
by Lieutenant Lantz.

07:27.446 --> 07:31.050
Or by anyone
with his eyeball.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.685
Which is currently missing.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.688
So you can appreciate
why DoD's top priority

07:35.755 --> 07:38.791
is to recover that missing
laptop as soon as possible.

07:38.858 --> 07:42.461
And NCIS's top priority
is justice for Lieutenant Lantz.

07:42.528 --> 07:43.796
And his eyeball.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.298
VANCE:
And I'm sure
that we can all walk

07:45.364 --> 07:47.700
and chew gum at the same time.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.635
Joe doesn't chew gum.
He's got TMJ.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.004
I actually had a condylotomy
last month.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.973
I'm right as rain now, Park.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.843
You two know each other?

07:56.909 --> 07:58.211
Long story.

07:58.277 --> 07:59.812
The way you tell it.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.214
Too bad I don't have time.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.915
For the moment,

08:02.982 --> 08:04.750
DIA will look
for the missing laptop.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.686
And we'll track Lantz's killer.

08:06.752 --> 08:09.455
And with any luck, finding one
will lead to the other.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.659
You got a hell of a Rolodex,
Parker.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.496
And I'd like to hear
that story sometime.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.898
(chuckles)

08:18.965 --> 08:20.666
Any word from Knight?

08:20.733 --> 08:22.435
Uh, she and Jimmy are still
rooting around in garbage,

08:22.501 --> 08:24.871
searching for that
missing eyeball.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.339
Well, it's probably not there,

08:26.405 --> 08:29.075
but let's not spoil
their fun just yet.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.744
All right, so, Lieutenant Lantz,

08:31.811 --> 08:33.045
who are you?

08:33.112 --> 08:34.447
TORRES:
Lieutenant Kane Lantz.

08:34.513 --> 08:36.582
He grew up poor,
and his parents died

08:36.649 --> 08:38.117
when he was seven years old.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.254
He bounced around foster
care till he aged out at 18.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.256
No picnic.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.256
TORRES: Yeah, until
he got into college

08:43.322 --> 08:45.758
on an ROTC scholarship.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.093
He graduated
an officer.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.095
You talk to his CO?

08:47.159 --> 08:49.095
Yeah.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.030
He said that, uh,
Lantz was quiet,

08:51.097 --> 08:52.365
worked hard,
kept to himself.

08:52.431 --> 08:54.367
No red flags.

08:52.431 --> 08:54.367
Well, I got one.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.236
He took home a classified laptop
he wasn't supposed to.

08:57.303 --> 09:00.539
Also, there was some, uh,
unusual bank activity.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.108
The past year,

09:02.174 --> 09:03.643
he was taking out more
than he was putting in.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.111
A lot more.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.879
Gambling problem?

09:06.946 --> 09:08.748
No, whatever the problem is,
we don't think it was his.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.082
TORRES:
Most of the
withdrawals

09:10.149 --> 09:12.251
were being transferred
to this guy.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.553
McGEE:
Alex Russo.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.322
Lantz's former foster brother.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.957
They spent a year together
in a home when they were kids.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.426
Fair to say
we should scoop him up.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.962
Oh, way ahead of you. Waiting
in the conference room.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.464
Oh, you guys work fast.

09:25.531 --> 09:26.799
(door opens)

09:28.334 --> 09:29.936
(clears throat)

09:30.002 --> 09:31.938
I don't, I don't know
nothing about nothing, man.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.473
We haven't actually
asked you anything yet.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.510
Well, go on. I still don't know.

09:41.647 --> 09:43.416
Do you know who that is?

09:44.417 --> 09:46.419
Yeah.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.755
Yeah, that's my...
that's my brother.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.658
(clears throat) Or the
closest thing I've got to one.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.994
Seems like you treated him
more like an ATM.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.698
And his bank statement shows
that your brother gave you

09:58.764 --> 10:00.700
quite a bit of money
over the last few years.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.302
Is this really what
you dragged me out of work for?

10:03.369 --> 10:04.503
Why do you need that money?

10:04.570 --> 10:06.572
I ain't got to tell you jack.

10:08.374 --> 10:13.913
Mr. Russo, your brother
was killed yesterday.

10:14.914 --> 10:15.982
What?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.451
We found his body this morning.

10:18.517 --> 10:21.387
Oh, my God. I-I...

10:21.454 --> 10:23.689
So if you know something...

10:24.957 --> 10:27.693
I, I tried to keep him
out of it.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.395
Tried to keep him out of what?

10:30.429 --> 10:32.531
I'm not the best
with money.

10:32.598 --> 10:36.902
Kane would help me
out now and then,

10:36.969 --> 10:39.805
um, when I got into trouble.

10:39.872 --> 10:43.142
And you've been getting into
a lot of trouble, I take it?

10:43.209 --> 10:46.078
I got tired of asking Kane
for money.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.316
So I found somebody
else to give me a loan.

10:50.383 --> 10:54.086
But then I, I skipped
a couple payments.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.155
Then one day this
big scary dude

10:56.222 --> 10:58.057
with an Eastern European
accent came by

10:58.124 --> 11:00.493
and he said,
uh, they would

11:00.559 --> 11:03.429
wipe my debt...

11:03.496 --> 11:05.031
if I just...

11:05.097 --> 11:06.832
If you what?

11:06.899 --> 11:10.236
If I give them
my brother's laptop.

11:10.302 --> 11:15.341
His military-grade,
biometrically-protected laptop?

11:15.408 --> 11:17.109
It looked like a normal
computer to me, okay?

11:17.176 --> 11:19.412
And I thought the Navy
would buy him another one.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.618
He was real mad, man,
when he found out.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.054
He said if he reported me,
I could go to jail.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.755
Well, maybe you deserved to.

11:31.424 --> 11:35.928
Let me guess, big brother
tried to fix it on his own?

11:35.995 --> 11:39.565
He said he would go get
the laptop himself.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.200
KNIGHT:
It just would have been nice

11:41.267 --> 11:43.269
to know the DIA
thinks that Lantz's eye

11:43.335 --> 11:44.770
is with the stolen computer
before I spent two hours

11:44.837 --> 11:46.372
digging through the trash.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.574
It was just a theory, and
we still needed to know.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.109
I would have stayed to help you,
Agent Knight,

11:50.176 --> 11:52.111
but the lieutenant's body
was calling.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.814
Oh, sure, used your job
as an excuse.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.915
Mm-hmm.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.883
Hey, speaking of excuses, uh,

11:57.950 --> 12:00.486
anyone else buying this,
uh, Torres "second wind" thing

12:00.553 --> 12:01.921
as far as blowing you off
last night?

12:01.987 --> 12:03.322
No.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.957
He seemed
a little off this morning, too.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.759
Something has got him in a mood.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.060
McGEE:
Yeah, I don't know.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.962
It's like he's been
more and more...

12:10.029 --> 12:11.130
Distant?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.631
Yeah.

12:12.698 --> 12:14.433
Ever since...

12:12.698 --> 12:14.433
Alaska.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.235
Would you stop
finishing my sentences?

12:16.302 --> 12:17.303
Yeah.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.804
Yeah, I've noticed that, too.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.139
It's like a delayed reaction
or something.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.141
Maybe he should talk
to Dr. Grace.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.176
That's never gonna happen.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.212
At least one of us?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.416
What?

12:30.483 --> 12:32.418
Jimmy,

12:32.485 --> 12:34.453
people have been known
to bare their souls to you.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.621
(chuckles)

12:34.520 --> 12:35.621
KNIGHT:
It's like this basement

12:35.688 --> 12:37.857
has given you mystical powers.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.925
Okay, fine. Yes, I will try

12:39.992 --> 12:41.660
to get him to open up. Try.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.929
After the update, though.

12:43.996 --> 12:46.132
Yes, let's do that.
Cause of death

12:46.198 --> 12:47.867
was a tracheal rupture.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.168
His windpipe was crushed.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.103
Meaning he was choked to death?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.539
Yeah, but it was a rocky road
to get to the end of that line.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.142
You're gonna have
to de-metaphor that for me.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.443
The lieutenant
had multiple breaks

12:57.510 --> 12:58.944
in his proximal phalanges.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.613
His left shoulder
was dislocated.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.382
He had tears in both
of his biceps

13:03.449 --> 13:05.284
as well as massive bruising

13:05.351 --> 13:07.186
all around his torso.

13:07.253 --> 13:12.024
Also, several of his fingernails
were removed.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.527
He wasn't choked to death.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.162
He was tortured.

13:16.228 --> 13:20.132
Yeah, the only question now is,
by who?

13:20.199 --> 13:21.667
I may have an answer.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.169
You always do.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.169
Hmm.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.371
And for the record,
normally that can be annoying,

13:25.437 --> 13:26.639
but it seems to work for you.

13:26.705 --> 13:29.408
Thank you. And you
have nice teeth.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.843
Since we're, you know,

13:30.910 --> 13:33.012
we're giving each
other compliments.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.647
Yeah, or we could just...

13:34.713 --> 13:36.215
Get back to the case.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.215
Yeah.

13:36.282 --> 13:39.185
Yeah, so, as it turns out,
the victim's entire body

13:39.251 --> 13:41.020
was covered in touch DNA.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.756
Let me guess, you got a hit?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.859
Oh, your optimism is cute,
but no. Not a single one.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.062
But using samples from around
the lieutenant's throat,

13:50.129 --> 13:51.664
I'm working on forensic DNA

13:51.730 --> 13:54.099
phenotyping the killer,
which is basically...

13:54.166 --> 13:57.002
Predicting visual traits
based on someone's DNA.

13:57.069 --> 13:59.104
Oh. I may not have
a name to give you,

13:59.171 --> 14:00.606
but at least you'll
have a sketch

14:00.673 --> 14:02.641
of the suspect so you'll know
who to look for.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.244
I guess that's better
than nothing.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.846
Not the enthusiastic reaction
I was hoping for,

14:07.913 --> 14:10.082
but, luckily, there's more.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.351
See those white flecks?

14:12.418 --> 14:13.786
Those are goose down
fiber particles

14:13.852 --> 14:15.554
I pulled from Lantz's abrasions.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.290
Interestingly,
they're unprocessed,

14:18.357 --> 14:20.826
like it was plucked
straight from the source.

14:22.094 --> 14:25.097
So our victim was killed
in a petting zoo?

14:25.164 --> 14:27.967
As it turns out, there are
no zoos, petting or otherwise,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.936
within a 20-mile radius of
the sanitation workers' route.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.706
But I found an
apparel factory

14:33.772 --> 14:37.209
that specialized
in winter parkas.

14:37.276 --> 14:38.644
It closed down two years ago.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.479
My guess?
The unprocessed down

14:40.546 --> 14:41.780
came from there.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.752
Isolated street,
blacked-out windows,

14:46.819 --> 14:48.754
excessive number
of padlocks on this fence.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.289
McGEE:
Pretty on-brand
for a torture chamber,

14:50.356 --> 14:51.824
if you ask me.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.895
NCIS!

15:03.402 --> 15:05.471
I'll look for the light.

15:05.537 --> 15:08.340
I'll look
for the dentist's chair.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.490
Well, this doesn't look
like a torture chamber.

15:24.556 --> 15:27.092
What exactly is this place?

15:34.099 --> 15:36.502
Yes, I'll keep you updated,
General Clark.

15:36.568 --> 15:40.706
Um, yeah, my daughter
began her training

15:40.773 --> 15:41.974
at FLETC last week.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.943
How did you
hear about that?

15:45.010 --> 15:47.813
If you can, try and keep that
on the DL, please.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.615
Thank you.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.183
So, uh, I'm just gonna pretend

15:51.250 --> 15:54.320
that I, uh, didn't hear
any of that, right?

15:54.386 --> 15:56.288
Hear what?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.891
Ah, Agent McGee, right on time.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.060
The DIA director
was disappointed

16:01.126 --> 16:02.861
we didn't find Lantz's laptop.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.797
And what did we find?

16:04.863 --> 16:07.700
Well, uh, as far as we can tell,

16:07.766 --> 16:09.735
that warehouse
appears to be some sort of

16:09.802 --> 16:11.570
cage-fighting arena.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.805
Cage fighting?

16:12.871 --> 16:14.540
The, uh, underground type.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.408
Jimmy confirms
that our lieutenant's

16:16.475 --> 16:20.145
asphyxiation could be consistent
with injuries from a fight.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.314
So his death could
have been an accident.

16:22.381 --> 16:23.582
Well, the accident
doesn't explain

16:23.649 --> 16:25.050
why somebody ripped his eye out.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.019
Well, none of it explains
how a Navy lieutenant

16:27.086 --> 16:29.221
who tried to get back
his stolen laptop

16:29.288 --> 16:32.424
ends up in an underground
fight club instead.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.562
TORRES:
So, this is our killer?

16:36.628 --> 16:38.664
A phenotype rendering of him,
yeah.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.333
Uh, Caucasian, blond hair,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.268
blue eyes.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.937
About six-two, 200 pounds.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.439
And according to his DNA,
he probably sneezes

16:47.506 --> 16:49.942
when he looks at the sun, but...

16:50.008 --> 16:51.510
I'm not sure
that's relevant.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.612
PARKER:
Can you print
that out for me?

16:53.679 --> 16:55.414
Coming PDQ.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.683
Torres, I need you
to show this image

16:57.750 --> 16:58.951
to our victim's brother
in the morning.

16:59.017 --> 17:01.787
See if he recognizes
the face, all right?

17:01.854 --> 17:05.357
Sure. Unless you'd rather
have Agent Sawyer do it.

17:07.326 --> 17:10.229
Do you think I should have
Agent Sawyer do it?

17:10.295 --> 17:12.097
Haven't really thought about it.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.699
Ah.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.768
You know, if you have a problem,
Agent Torres,

17:15.834 --> 17:17.903
my door is always open.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.438
Especially since
I don't have one.

17:19.505 --> 17:20.906
No, no. No problem.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.474
Just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.009
A job is a job.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.581
KASIE:
Sorry, did you
still want this?

17:29.648 --> 17:31.650
I can come back.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.787
I mean, it is my office, but...

17:39.124 --> 17:40.559
(exhales)

17:40.626 --> 17:43.128
Is this hot-cold thing
normal for him?

17:43.195 --> 17:47.166
No, that was super weird.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.574
McGEE:
Okay. Great, no, yeah,
he just walked in.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.776
I'll let him know. Thanks.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.178
Good news.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.079
Torres just talked
to the victim's brother.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.315
Turns out the guy
in the CGI image

18:03.382 --> 18:05.584
is the same guy that had him
steal that laptop.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.852
So we got our killer.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.353
Did the brother
happen to catch

18:08.420 --> 18:10.422
a name, by any chance?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.422
No, but at least we have

18:10.489 --> 18:12.791
a face to go with that scary
Eastern European accent.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.195
Well, that narrows it down
to 292 million people.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.798
Well, I just narrowed it down
even further to one.

18:19.865 --> 18:20.966
Though,
for the record,

18:21.033 --> 18:22.668
it is strange that you know

18:22.734 --> 18:24.770
the exact population
of Eastern Europe.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.039
I compared the image
to the traffic cam footage

18:27.105 --> 18:28.707
from an intersection
near the cage-fighting warehouse

18:28.774 --> 18:30.142
and I got a hit.

18:30.209 --> 18:32.377
Does that guy look familiar?

18:32.444 --> 18:33.879
PARKER:
Looks like we found

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948
our scary European.

18:36.014 --> 18:36.949
I assume you ran the plates?

18:37.015 --> 18:38.317
They're fake.

18:38.383 --> 18:39.485
But look what is on the dash.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.820
"Metro Discount Tires."

18:41.887 --> 18:43.989
He works there. And I already
got the employee records.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.724
PARKER:
Oh.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.292
Hello, Maxim Dovhal.

18:47.359 --> 18:50.062
Only problem is, Maxim
Dovhal doesn't exist.

18:50.128 --> 18:51.864
There are no records
of someone by that name

18:51.930 --> 18:53.832
outside of these
payroll records.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.534
He could be
an undocumented worker,

18:55.601 --> 18:57.135
looking to stay off the radar.

18:57.202 --> 18:58.537
Well, let's stake out
the tire shop

18:58.604 --> 19:00.072
and wait for him
to come to work.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.406
That works for me.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.375
Uh, listen, but, uh,
before you two go,

19:03.442 --> 19:05.544
uh, I want to ask you something.

19:05.611 --> 19:09.414
Does Torres have some kind of
an issue with Agent Sawyer?

19:09.481 --> 19:10.749
(laughs softly)

19:10.816 --> 19:13.051
Um, well, I-I think,
uh, everyone does

19:13.118 --> 19:15.387
at some point or another. Why?

19:15.454 --> 19:19.591
Well, he's acting,
I don't know... something.

19:19.658 --> 19:24.062
Yeah, you're not the only one
who's noticed something.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.365
Although I don't
think it's Sawyer.

19:26.431 --> 19:28.233
I think he's just
icing on the cake.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.568
What's the cake?

19:29.635 --> 19:31.003
McGEE:
Don't know.

19:31.069 --> 19:32.771
And I'm not sure
you're gonna get Nick

19:32.838 --> 19:34.540
to talk about it either,
you know?

19:34.606 --> 19:37.342
The more you-you push him,
the more he shuts down.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.878
Well, then, let's stop pushing.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.881
You know him best, McGee.
You got any ideas?

19:42.948 --> 19:44.883
Stakeout.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.219
Stakeout gets boring, you know,
it may get him talking.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.954
PARKER:
All right, sounds good.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.756
Why don't you sit this
one out, tag Torres in,

19:50.822 --> 19:54.493
and you put your hostage
negotiating skills to work.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.965
You want me to get the sealed
black box to open up?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.199
Mm-hmm.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.868
(soft laughter)

20:02.935 --> 20:06.471
I'll give it a shot.
Wish me luck.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.812
KNIGHT:
No sign of Dovhal.
You got anything?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.814
Nothing.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.585
(sighs)

20:19.651 --> 20:23.055
Could you look
a little less bored

20:23.121 --> 20:25.123
while we're trying
to find this guy?

20:25.190 --> 20:28.093
It's a stakeout. It's boring.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.428
Well, we could be here
for a while,

20:29.494 --> 20:31.663
so you got to keep
your energy up.

20:32.864 --> 20:36.268
Okay, let's play
Carpool Karaoke.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.571
(laughs)
Not in your lifetime.

20:39.638 --> 20:40.806
You don't sing?

20:40.872 --> 20:42.741
Not in front of people.

20:42.808 --> 20:44.843
At least not until
I've had a few drinks.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.115
How about 20 questions?

20:50.182 --> 20:52.184
It's a hard pass.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.184
Oh, come on.

20:52.250 --> 20:55.487
Ask me anything.

20:55.554 --> 20:58.790
Okay. So would you rather

20:58.857 --> 21:02.127
shave Vance's mustache
or Parker's beard?

21:02.194 --> 21:03.662
Seriously?

21:03.729 --> 21:06.498
You said anything. Which one?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.200
Neither.

21:08.266 --> 21:09.868
Nope. You got to pick one.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.837
Is this something that
you've thought about before?

21:11.903 --> 21:13.472
Can you just answer
the damn question?

21:13.538 --> 21:15.273
Fine. Parker.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.042
Wow. Interesting.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.211
Why is that interesting?

21:19.277 --> 21:20.445
Is that your question?

21:20.512 --> 21:23.015
No. No.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.716
I have got a much better one.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.885
Okay. Lay it on me.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.921
How...

21:31.289 --> 21:34.459
...are you doing?

21:34.526 --> 21:36.461
What kind of question is that?

21:36.528 --> 21:39.464
The kind you ask a friend
if you're worried about them.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.037
Is this a game
or an intervention?

21:45.103 --> 21:48.240
Do you think you need
an intervention?

21:49.307 --> 21:51.243
Next question.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.477
I answered your
weird question about

21:52.544 --> 21:54.813
our bosses' facial hair, so...

21:57.883 --> 22:00.218
I'm fine.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.989
So just drop it. Okay?

22:07.492 --> 22:09.528
I'm just trying to be
a good friend, okay?

22:09.594 --> 22:11.997
But we're colleagues,
we're not friends.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.832
We're supposed to have
each other's backs on the job,

22:13.899 --> 22:15.233
and that is it.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.935
What are you talking about?

22:17.002 --> 22:18.503
I've only been here
for a minute and I know

22:18.570 --> 22:20.038
that's not
how Gibbs' team works.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.241
Well, this isn't
Gibbs' team anymore.

22:24.342 --> 22:26.244
Is it?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.185
Two o'clock.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.657
Yeah, that's him.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.927
TORRES:
Maxim Dovhal? NCIS.

22:41.993 --> 22:43.795
You need to step over here
and put your hands

22:43.862 --> 22:45.197
behind your head.

22:45.263 --> 22:46.231
You're under arrest
for the murder

22:46.298 --> 22:48.200
of Lieutenant Kane Lantz.

22:48.266 --> 22:50.135
(grunts)

22:51.536 --> 22:52.637
I go right!

22:57.809 --> 22:59.644
(grunts)

23:01.480 --> 23:03.281
Dovhal, stop!

23:03.348 --> 23:04.783
Where the hell is he?

23:04.850 --> 23:06.384
Where'd he go?

23:06.451 --> 23:07.719
(shouts)

23:06.451 --> 23:07.719
Oh!

23:09.821 --> 23:11.890
(grunting)

23:11.957 --> 23:13.325
Kick me harder.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.326
What?

23:14.392 --> 23:15.527
It has to look convincing.

23:17.796 --> 23:18.663
Don't move, man.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.599
(whispering):
Hit me.

23:20.665 --> 23:22.634
Please. They could be watching.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.805
(Taser clicking)

23:24.836 --> 23:26.805
(groaning)

23:37.983 --> 23:40.452
PARKER:
So, how do you know
Lieutenant Lantz?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.254
I don't know this man.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.589
I find that very hard to
believe, since your DNA

23:44.656 --> 23:46.491
was all over him.

23:47.826 --> 23:50.896
Which happens sometimes
after you murder someone.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.770
I had no choice.
I-I didn't want to hurt him.

23:58.837 --> 24:02.040
Well, you hurt him.

24:02.107 --> 24:05.644
They forced us to fight.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.112
They said they'd kill my wife

24:07.179 --> 24:09.414
if I didn't do
exactly as I was told.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.752
Who is "they"?

24:15.053 --> 24:17.522
I don't know. I don't
know who's in charge.

24:17.589 --> 24:21.660
I just... do as they say.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.428
And where's your wife?

24:24.429 --> 24:25.897
I don't know.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.233
We can help you find her

24:28.300 --> 24:30.402
if you tell us

24:30.468 --> 24:32.037
how you got involved

24:32.103 --> 24:35.106
in an underground fight club
in the first place.

24:38.877 --> 24:43.915
My wife Elena and I,
we're from Belarus.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.085
We've always dreamed
of coming to America.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.687
Then, last year

24:48.753 --> 24:52.057
we saw an advertisement
promising good jobs here,

24:52.123 --> 24:55.927
bypassing official
immigration rules for a fee.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.596
It doesn't work that way.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.232
It does where I come from.

25:00.298 --> 25:03.068
But when we got here,

25:03.134 --> 25:06.671
we were separated and sent
to different locations.

25:06.738 --> 25:10.809
They said if we spoke
to the police, we'd be killed.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.012
They made me collect
money from people.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.948
Eventually...

25:18.250 --> 25:20.185
They made you fight.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.457
I haven't heard
from my wife in months.

25:25.523 --> 25:29.361
If they make me fight
against my will,

25:29.427 --> 25:33.331
I cannot even think what Elena
is being forced to do.

25:35.166 --> 25:38.603
I'll pay the price
for killing this man.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.773
But please...

25:42.774 --> 25:44.809
...find my Elena.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.413
KNIGHT:
Our underground fight club case
just turned

25:48.480 --> 25:50.215
into a human trafficking case.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.883
Well, do we know why these
traffickers were so interested

25:51.950 --> 25:53.084
in Lantz's laptop?

25:53.151 --> 25:54.586
We think they wanted access

25:54.653 --> 25:56.922
to ONI servers to
backdoor their way

25:56.988 --> 25:58.590
into Homeland Security's
systems.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.625
When Lantz went to get
his laptop back,

26:00.692 --> 26:02.394
they told him
he could fight for it.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.095
But they were never
gonna let him go.

26:04.162 --> 26:05.230
They needed his eye.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.932
Do we know who "they" is yet?

26:06.998 --> 26:08.900
A buddy at the Bureau
thinks that these traffickers

26:08.967 --> 26:11.603
are part of a nationwide network
of other fight clubs

26:11.670 --> 26:13.238
and prostitution rings.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.839
So, we take them down.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.274
I mean, we know where one
of them is operating.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.842
Well, yeah, but if we go
through the front door

26:17.909 --> 26:19.678
without knowing where
those others clubs are,

26:19.744 --> 26:21.579
they could disappear
into thin air.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.416
Along with the other victims
like Maxim and his wife.

26:24.482 --> 26:26.351
We need to figure out
who the head guy is

26:26.418 --> 26:27.986
before we make a move.

26:28.053 --> 26:32.824
Are you saying we should
go undercover as fighters?

26:32.891 --> 26:35.026
Maxim says that they hold
challenge matches

26:35.093 --> 26:36.461
every few weeks.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.296
TORRES:
What are the chances
that the head

26:38.363 --> 26:40.198
of a trafficking organization
is actually gonna show his face?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.800
KNIGHT:
Not good.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.768
But Maxim did say that he likes
to meet privately

26:43.835 --> 26:45.837
with the really good newcomers
who win their fights.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.973
All right, so we
need to sign up,

26:48.039 --> 26:49.541
win, get a meeting
with the boss.

26:49.607 --> 26:52.344
Right, I'm thinking that you
and Torres go in together

26:52.410 --> 26:54.479
to fight each other,
then no matter who wins,

26:54.546 --> 26:55.880
we meet the boss.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.383
No, no, no. Not McGee.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.419
What, you don't think I'd make
a convincing cage fighter?

27:02.587 --> 27:04.022
Okay, fine.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.223
I wouldn't make
a convincing cage fighter.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.658
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

27:06.725 --> 27:07.726
TORRES:
'Cause if we're doing this,

27:07.792 --> 27:08.860
it's got to be real.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.729
I would have to hurt you, and...

27:10.795 --> 27:12.564
I can't do that.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.800
Then I guess we need to find
somebody you can hurt.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.969
Any suggestions?

27:19.604 --> 27:21.272
I may have one in mind, yeah.

27:23.274 --> 27:25.243
Oh, this might just be the worst
decision I've ever made.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.644
All right, Torres,
let's hear it.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.179
TORRES:
Tiago Morales.

27:28.246 --> 27:30.315
Born February 4, 1979,

27:30.382 --> 27:31.549
Colombia.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.551
Moved to Nevada
when I was three.

27:33.618 --> 27:34.853
Sawyer?

27:33.618 --> 27:34.853
SAWYER:
Scott Blake.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.921
Born August 11, 1985.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.257
From Fayette County,
Pennsylvania.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.859
Once we take the trafficking
ring down, I'd love to talk

27:40.925 --> 27:42.093
to you about making
undercover work

27:42.160 --> 27:44.062
my regular assignment.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.062
Ah.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.997
My talents are wasted
behind a desk.

27:46.064 --> 27:48.733
All you and Agent Torres need to
focus on right now is the fight.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.602
I'll be ringside,
part of the team.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.937
Knight and I will run comms
from the van.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.272
If at any time you need
to stop the fight,

27:54.339 --> 27:55.740
Agent McGee will throw
the white towel.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.108
That won't be necessary.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.543
McGEE:
All right, Torres,
you are winning.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.578
You're gonna get
our meeting with the boss.

28:00.645 --> 28:02.247
Torres, Sawyer, why don't
you two get comfortable

28:02.313 --> 28:04.949
with each other's styles
before you go live, okay?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.351
Well, this should be fun.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.952
What it needs to be
is convincing.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.687
Well, if you want it to be
convincing, Director,

28:09.754 --> 28:10.755
I should probably be the winner.

28:10.822 --> 28:12.223
Or, Director,
I can just kick

28:12.290 --> 28:13.358
the crap out of him,
and then it would be

28:13.425 --> 28:15.126
really, really convincing.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.528
PARKER:
Okay, why don't we just
stick to the plan,

28:16.594 --> 28:18.196
or McGee and I will
get in the ring?

28:18.263 --> 28:19.464
Nobody wants to see that.

28:20.331 --> 28:21.766
All right, ready.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.234
(whistle blows)

28:21.833 --> 28:23.234
(both grunting)

28:31.943 --> 28:33.945
What the hell are you doing?

28:31.943 --> 28:33.945
Just showing moves,

28:34.012 --> 28:35.280
in case the director
wants to change his mind.

28:35.346 --> 28:36.614
(grunting)

28:39.317 --> 28:40.785
It's not an audition, man.

28:40.852 --> 28:42.287
You're lucky enough to be here

28:42.353 --> 28:43.621
and not pushing papers
on night shift.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.457
Okay. Calm down.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.457
Take it easy, Nick.

28:45.523 --> 28:46.991
Why are you so
threatened by me, Torres?

28:47.058 --> 28:49.160
I mean, I guess
I get the jealousy.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.662
Say that again.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.662
What?

28:50.728 --> 28:51.796
That I'm twice the agent
you'll ever be?

28:51.863 --> 28:53.565
(grunting)

28:56.634 --> 28:57.936
Hey, hey, hey!

28:58.002 --> 28:59.504
All right, all right,
that's enough.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.638
Nick, Nick, Nick...

28:59.571 --> 29:00.638
Knock it off!

29:00.705 --> 29:02.507
(overlapping shouts)

29:03.675 --> 29:06.077
Come on! Back off.

29:03.675 --> 29:06.077
All right, fight's over.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.979
Come on, man.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.647
Well, this is certainly going
how I thought it would.

29:09.714 --> 29:11.516
At least my part's done.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.851
We're on for tonight?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.586
I just spoke
with Maxim's contact.

29:14.652 --> 29:17.188
The normal buy-in
for a challenge fight is $500,

29:17.255 --> 29:19.991
but I struck a deal-- a thousand
each-- and Torres and Sawyer

29:20.058 --> 29:22.026
are guaranteed to
fight each other.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.026
Good work, Agent Knight.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.795
All we have
to do now

29:23.862 --> 29:25.263
is keep these two
from killing each other.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.535
Comm check?

29:28.533 --> 29:30.535
TORRES:
Go for Torres.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.004
Go for McGee.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.004
Go for Sawyer.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.807
All right, move in. Remember,
your contact's name is Sammy.

29:35.874 --> 29:37.308
All right, guys, we ready?

29:37.375 --> 29:38.810
Let's go, team.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.845
Team. Right.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.648
You good?

29:43.715 --> 29:45.950
Let's just get
this over with.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.686
(indistinct chatter)

29:48.753 --> 29:50.788
(sighs)

29:52.223 --> 29:54.325
Whoa, whoa!

29:54.392 --> 29:56.161
We're not open
to the public.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.329
You want in on the action,
go online at www...

29:56.227 --> 29:58.329
No, no, no.

29:58.396 --> 29:59.831
We're actually here
for the challenge fight.

29:59.898 --> 30:01.566
Sammy's expecting us.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.668
Tiago Morales and, uh,

30:03.735 --> 30:05.737
Scott Blake.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.737
Check the list.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.807
You the money guy?

30:09.874 --> 30:13.211
Small bills, non-sequential,
just like Sammy asked.

30:14.445 --> 30:15.747
Hmm.

30:15.813 --> 30:18.016
Keys, phones, wallets.

30:18.082 --> 30:20.318
You'll get 'em back
at the end of the night.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.223
Wait back there
until you hear your names.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.595
(grunting)

30:30.662 --> 30:31.829
Hey.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.731
Who the hell are you?

30:33.798 --> 30:34.866
Ah, name's Eddy.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.100
This is Tiago Morales,

30:36.167 --> 30:38.102
this is Scott Blake.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.004
And this is for you.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.375
Oh, yeah, challenge fighters.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.878
Your girl told me to expect you.
You know the rules?

30:46.945 --> 30:48.613
Everything goes, right?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.348
Yeah, as long
as you put on a good show.

30:50.415 --> 30:53.084
All right, boys,
let's go get loose.

30:53.151 --> 30:55.286
Yeah, oh, except one more thing.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.055
Uh, Morales,

30:57.121 --> 30:58.890
you're gonna fight Vern first,
not your buddy here.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.692
McGEE:
Whoa, whoa. Hold on. No, no.

31:00.758 --> 31:02.393
That wasn't the deal.
My boys fight each other.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.895
SAMMY:
Oh, yeah? Whatever.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.296
It's not how it works.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.764
You don't get
to request your opponent.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.099
Why not?

31:08.166 --> 31:09.801
Because for all I know,

31:09.867 --> 31:12.704
the three of you have some kind
of arrangement.

31:12.770 --> 31:16.441
Maybe you got
some outside bets on this one.

31:16.507 --> 31:18.810
You're calling me a cheat?

31:18.876 --> 31:20.878
(chuckles)
Look around, pal.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.981
This place ain't exactly
full of saints.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.949
And, um, I'm not one either.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.651
So, he fights Vern,

31:26.718 --> 31:28.486
or we got a problem.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.288
TORRES:
Yeah, it's no problem.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.224
Don't worry about it.

31:33.291 --> 31:36.127
I'm pretty sure
I can take a guy named Vern.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.730
Good. Yo, Vern?

31:38.796 --> 31:40.531
Come meet
your new opponent.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.081
(grunting)

32:03.321 --> 32:05.189
Guy's pretty big.

32:06.524 --> 32:08.626
It's your call, Nick.
Whatever you want to do, man.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.328
Actually, it's my call.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.597
(sighs)

32:12.664 --> 32:14.165
All right, the operation's off.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.034
We'll find another way
to get to

32:16.100 --> 32:17.602
whoever's running this thing.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.602
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.270
What if we don't get
this close again?

32:19.337 --> 32:22.173
Maybe we wait and see
who Sawyer's paired up with

32:22.240 --> 32:23.775
before we make any decisions.

32:23.841 --> 32:25.209
Yeah, works for me.

32:25.276 --> 32:26.978
Everybody just chill out.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.212
I can take this guy.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.814
Nick, I don't know
about this one, man.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.115
Did you see what they did
to the lieutenant?

32:31.182 --> 32:34.052
Yeah. So?

32:34.118 --> 32:36.621
Wait. What's going on
with you, man?

32:36.688 --> 32:38.489
Nothing.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.525
You see this guy's
arms? Each one

32:40.591 --> 32:41.859
is the size of my torso.

32:41.926 --> 32:43.161
Tim, I've done

32:43.227 --> 32:44.295
more dangerous operations
than this.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.032
That's the job.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.468
(whispering):
Screw the job.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.036
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.504
SAMMY:
Morales,

32:53.571 --> 32:54.939
Vern, you're up.

32:56.107 --> 32:57.975
(chuckles)

32:58.976 --> 33:00.378
Hey.

33:00.445 --> 33:03.081
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.317
Our first battle tonight,
a challenger bout

33:06.384 --> 33:08.219
featuring a newcomer--
Tiago Morales--

33:08.286 --> 33:12.857
and the Malice from Dallas--
Vern...

33:12.924 --> 33:15.393
How about a big round
of applause for these fighters?

33:15.460 --> 33:16.394
(applause)

33:16.461 --> 33:17.695
Time now for the refs...

33:17.762 --> 33:19.564
McGee, do we have a problem?

33:19.630 --> 33:21.065
What do you think?

33:22.600 --> 33:24.202
Looks like we have a problem.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.537
PARKER: Sawyer?

33:24.268 --> 33:26.537
SAWYER: Copy.

33:26.604 --> 33:27.705
PARKER:
We can't count
on Torres winning this thing,

33:27.772 --> 33:29.040
so we better improvise.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.775
I want you to scour the place
and find

33:30.842 --> 33:32.944
any useful intel you can

33:33.010 --> 33:34.579
before our boy loses
consciousness, all right?

33:34.645 --> 33:35.947
SAWYER:
Copy.

He's not dead yet.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.209

34:05.276 --> 34:06.577
About three minutes.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.212
Then you've got two minutes

Get out of there.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.354
Hang on.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.290
Got a brand-new fridge.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.691

(Torres groans)

35:39.971 --> 35:41.806
KNIGHT:
What's he doing?

35:42.807 --> 35:44.775
(groaning)

35:48.045 --> 35:49.480
What are you doing out there?
You look

35:49.547 --> 35:50.581
like you're trying
to get yourself killed.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.250
Yeah? So?

35:52.316 --> 35:54.218
What do you mean, "So?"

35:54.285 --> 35:57.221
Who's left to care, man?

35:57.288 --> 35:58.689
Me.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.858
Yeah, until you don't.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.894
Nick, where am I going?
I'm not going anywhere.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.696
I don't know, man,
but you already have a family.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.332
You don't need me.

36:13.237 --> 36:14.705
Let's go!
Fighters, to your corners.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.108
To your corners.
To your corners.

36:17.174 --> 36:19.010
Go!

REFEREE: He's done.
He's done. Let go. Let go.

36:53.644 --> 36:55.613
Let go. Let go. He's done.
Let go. Let go.

36:55.680 --> 36:56.614
Get up.

(groaning)

37:09.527 --> 37:12.363
(bell clanging)

37:16.067 --> 37:19.236
I told you
I would beat that guy's ass.

37:19.303 --> 37:21.305
You did.

37:21.372 --> 37:23.441
It's my bad.

37:23.507 --> 37:26.510
And by the way, I do need you.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.013
MAN:
All right, everyone out.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.615
Now!

37:30.681 --> 37:32.149
SAMMY:
You heard the man.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.185
Out. Now.

37:34.251 --> 37:36.821
Uh, we're waiting
for our meeting.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.124
What meeting?

37:40.191 --> 37:41.959
A meeting with the big boss.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.462
Boss doesn't meet anyone
he doesn't know.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.598
We were told that he likes
to meet the new winners.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.467
Who told you that?

37:49.533 --> 37:52.770
Look, if there's a problem,

37:52.837 --> 37:54.939
we're good.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.008
No, we're not good.

37:57.074 --> 38:00.344
Uh, wh-why do you want
to meet the boss? Huh?

38:00.411 --> 38:01.979
Who sent you?

38:02.046 --> 38:03.447
Nobody sent us.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.418
Nobody meets the boss. Ever.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.522
NCIS!

38:09.353 --> 38:11.522
KNIGHT:
On the ground!

38:11.589 --> 38:12.823
Get down!

38:11.589 --> 38:12.823
On the ground now!

38:12.890 --> 38:14.125
On the ground now!
Let's go!

38:12.890 --> 38:14.125
Go!

38:14.191 --> 38:16.627
Move it! Hands out
in front! Move!

38:19.030 --> 38:20.698
PARKER:
McGee, Torres,

38:20.765 --> 38:22.466
meet the boss.

38:36.914 --> 38:40.351
Sammy's real name
is Peter Samkharadze.

38:40.418 --> 38:43.688
No wonder he shortened it.

38:40.418 --> 38:43.688
Never would have

38:43.754 --> 38:46.424
pegged him as the top dog.

38:43.754 --> 38:46.424
PARKER: No one did.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.526
That's why he was able to fly
under the radar for so long.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.661
Jimmy had mentioned
that Lieutenant Lantz's

38:50.728 --> 38:52.530
eyeball could be covered
in forensic evidence.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.699
Well, turns out, it was.

38:54.765 --> 38:57.168
Knight and I were able
to lift prints off the jar

38:57.234 --> 38:59.070
while Torres was getting
his face rearranged.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.005
And Sammy admitted
to using the eye

39:01.072 --> 39:03.274
to access the stolen ONI laptop?

39:03.340 --> 39:05.409
Yeah, not only that.
Once he realized he was looking

39:05.476 --> 39:08.012
at seven life sentences, the guy
couldn't wait to cut a deal.

39:08.079 --> 39:11.115
He admitted to being in charge
of the entire operation.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.117
Gave up the location
of the laptop

39:13.184 --> 39:15.586
and all the human trafficking
rings that he was in charge of.

39:15.653 --> 39:17.555
Victims are being
freed as we speak.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.623
General Clark will be glad
to hear that.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.392
Give him my best.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.294
(chuckles)

39:24.295 --> 39:25.229
(elevator bell dings)

39:25.296 --> 39:26.964
(elevator doors open)

39:32.336 --> 39:34.805
Elena? Elena.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.974
(laughing)

39:37.041 --> 39:38.442
Look at this.

39:38.509 --> 39:42.213
(speaking Belarusian)

39:43.814 --> 39:46.117
Where's Torres?
He's missing all the fun.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.887
I sent him down to Jimmy
to get stitched up.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.323
Oh. Smart.

39:52.389 --> 39:55.926
There's something about that
room down there, you know?

39:55.993 --> 40:00.264
Ah, must've felt good to hit
that guy in the face, huh?

40:00.331 --> 40:03.334
Not as good
as I thought it would.

40:00.331 --> 40:03.334
(chuckles)

40:04.401 --> 40:07.404
Heard you laid
into Sawyer, as well.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.842
Yeah.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.911
He was at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.914
So...

40:16.981 --> 40:21.418
are you ready to talk yet?

40:21.485 --> 40:23.487
About?

40:24.488 --> 40:26.690
About why you're so angry.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.859
Oh, okay.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.162
Is that why
McGee sent me down here?

40:31.228 --> 40:33.164
We all care about you, Nick,

40:33.230 --> 40:37.301
but you don't have to explain
yourself to me, all right?

40:37.368 --> 40:38.402
I get it.

40:39.403 --> 40:42.173
Do you?

40:39.403 --> 40:42.173
Yeah, you feel
abandoned.

40:42.239 --> 40:46.143
You feel left behind.
Trust me, I do get that.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.545
Yeah, of course you do.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.381
You were closer
with the old team.

40:51.415 --> 40:54.318
I'm not talking
about the team.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.353
I'm talking about Breena.

40:59.390 --> 41:01.525
Jimmy,

41:01.592 --> 41:04.461
you were angry
at your wife for dying?

41:05.462 --> 41:08.332
Sometimes.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.035
Even though
she fought like hell to stay.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.705
How crazy is that? Huh?

41:15.706 --> 41:17.808
You hide it well.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.844
Not really, no.

41:19.910 --> 41:22.980
I got Dr. Grace
on speed-dial.

41:23.047 --> 41:26.550
Oh. Right.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.886
What does she have
to say about it?

41:28.953 --> 41:30.554
She usually says, uh,

41:30.621 --> 41:33.023
"And how does that
make you feel, Jimmy?"

41:33.090 --> 41:37.027
Of course she does, but isn't
that what you pay her for--

41:37.094 --> 41:40.331
to, uh, answer that question?

41:40.397 --> 41:42.533
That's what I thought at
first, but then I realized

41:42.600 --> 41:45.102
it's better to come
to your own conclusions.

41:45.169 --> 41:48.505
And what I've come to is...

41:51.308 --> 41:53.344
...sometimes people leave.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.914
Even fathers.

41:58.649 --> 42:02.186
And it's got nothing
to do with you.

42:05.589 --> 42:07.758
What if it does?

42:07.825 --> 42:09.526
Well, that's when it's time

42:09.593 --> 42:11.195
to lean on the people
that are still here for you.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.797
Nick...

42:13.864 --> 42:17.601
you have to open yourself up
to getting hurt again

42:17.668 --> 42:19.703
if you ever want to heal.
