01:28.088 --> 01:32.842
<i>Shohei Ohtani is the only player
in modern MLB history</i>

01:33.676 --> 01:37.222
<i>with over 10 pitching wins, 40 homers,</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:41.643
<i>and 15 stolen bases in the same season.</i>

01:42.602 --> 01:44.270
<i>In the All-Star Game,</i>

01:44.437 --> 01:49.776
<i>he was the sole player selected as
both a designated hitter and a pitcher.</i>

01:49.901 --> 01:55.907
<i>His strikeout and home run count surpassed
records set by Babe Ruth</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:57.826
<i>over 100 years ago.</i>

01:59.035 --> 02:04.082
<i>This is the story of the most
unique player in baseball history.</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:13.299
{\an8}<i>Born in 1994,</i>

02:13.758 --> 02:17.637
{\an8}<i>Shohei Ohtani grew up in a small town
in Iwate, Japan.</i>

02:20.473 --> 02:26.896
{\an8}<i>No one expected a legend in the making
to come from such a rural area.</i>

02:29.816 --> 02:36.156
I grew up in the countryside of Japan
with only a few baseball teams around,

02:36.656 --> 02:40.535
where most of the teams had never
been to big tournaments.

02:43.580 --> 02:48.501
I was sure plenty of other players
outshined me in talent.

02:49.919 --> 02:53.506
<i>This is where his journey began.</i>

03:07.687 --> 03:10.899
Sure, I wanted to become
a great baseball player,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.110
but had no conviction it would come true.

03:25.288 --> 03:29.292
<i>As a kid, Shohei watched
Major League Baseball,</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:32.795
<i>and dreamed of playing there one day.</i>

03:35.131 --> 03:37.300
We had a computer at our house.

03:38.092 --> 03:42.847
I definitely looked pitchers, but
also searched for sequence shots

03:43.389 --> 03:45.016
and videos of various players.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.811
You started being able to look up
these things online.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.649
That process had
a significant influence on me.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.359
Even as a kid, it was obvious.

04:37.068 --> 04:41.281
The players in the MLB
were on a different level.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.741
Watching them on TV and other media,

04:44.200 --> 04:50.248
Ichiro-san, Matsui-san, before them were
Randy Johnson, Pedro MartÃ­nez...

04:50.373 --> 04:54.877
Barry Bonds, the list goes on,
Ken Griffey Jr. ...

04:55.461 --> 05:01.342
Even as a child, it was clear to me that
MLB was the place for top-tier baseball.

05:01.426 --> 05:05.763
I've always been the type
to take on challenges.

05:06.931 --> 05:13.354
I was inevitably drawn to see how far
I could make it in the MLB.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.660
I studied his batting form and this...

05:27.785 --> 05:29.620
I bet everyone's done it.

05:30.204 --> 05:34.208
<i>I had a bat at home
that I would swing whenever I wanted to.</i>

05:34.292 --> 05:37.003
I was just freewheeling back then.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.839
I'm very flattered.

05:40.214 --> 05:47.013
Knowing that Shohei, who has come so far
and has a huge presence in the MLB,

05:47.680 --> 05:54.395
looked up to me when he was
in little league is meaningful to me.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.067
I'm very happy to hear that.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.576
I doubt he wants this.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.581
Thank you.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.251
This is awesome.

06:17.794 --> 06:23.800
I'm not really the kind of person
who likes to ask for favors.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.761
I will treasure this.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.308
<i>In the year of 2009,</i>

06:32.433 --> 06:37.188
<i>Shohei watched Pedro and I
face off in the World Series.</i>

06:39.941 --> 06:43.945
Pedro MartÃ­nez is one of
my favorite pitchers.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.157
Particularly,
the earlier days of his career

06:49.033 --> 06:52.412
were what I really enjoyed watching.

06:52.829 --> 06:59.460
Seeing players like him and the handful of
Japanese players who made it in the MLB,

06:59.585 --> 07:05.216
facing off on the big stage of the
World Series was a special moment for me.

07:05.675 --> 07:09.303
Especially since
I was a fan of both players.

07:23.901 --> 07:28.114
Yes, I saw it.
A home run into the right field.

07:28.448 --> 07:33.744
Pedro MartÃ­nez might not be
a big-bodied athlete, but despite that,

07:34.620 --> 07:38.583
he efficiently imparts power to the ball.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.419
Not to mention his repertoire.

07:43.796 --> 07:48.718
Compared to him,
I'm on the larger side of pitchers.

07:49.635 --> 07:54.265
My size actually makes
it difficult for me to pitch like him.

07:55.183 --> 08:00.480
I knew I needed to practice a lot more
to do what he was doing.

08:00.646 --> 08:06.235
If a pitcher with a large build
like mine can execute such moves,

08:06.777 --> 08:09.822
I believe that player
would perform very well.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.886
I'm thankful for him being
a great example for me.

09:33.447 --> 09:38.369
Throughout the long history of baseball,
there have been many pitchers.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.914
But delivering a smooth pitch like his,

09:42.999 --> 09:46.711
there aren't many
pitchers who can match that.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.964
Of course, I'm probably biased.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.646
My parents took me
to baseball practices every week.

10:48.105 --> 10:54.403
They let me pursue what I wanted.
I also took swimming lessons at that time.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.950
That was the role my parents fulfilled...

11:00.076 --> 11:01.410
How should I say this?

11:02.912 --> 11:07.708
They are wonderful parents,
but not my mentors.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.921
I really respect my parents
for who they are,

11:12.046 --> 11:14.965
but hearing the exact same words

11:15.049 --> 11:19.845
from a teacher I really respect
at school hits differently than

11:20.471 --> 11:23.015
hearing them from my parents.

11:24.016 --> 11:28.646
There's a difference in how
those words convey meaning to me.

11:28.813 --> 11:32.525
I love my parents
and am thankful for their support.

11:33.150 --> 11:39.365
I would never have been able
to do any of this without them.

11:39.657 --> 11:46.288
But when it comes to the question
of the most influential person in my life,

11:47.123 --> 11:49.291
that's a different story.

11:53.087 --> 11:59.176
Back when we were negotiating
to bring him to the Fighters,

11:59.635 --> 12:02.471
his mom was always there for us.

12:03.097 --> 12:07.184
There was a sense
of generosity about his parents.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.604
They care for him a lot
and love him dearly,

12:11.147 --> 12:14.191
yet they always
let him decide for himself.

12:14.316 --> 12:20.823
His dad taught him the basics of baseball,
like playing catch and running hard.

12:20.906 --> 12:26.203
Teaching him those important things
had a huge impact on him.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.853
<i>As a freshman in high school,</i>

12:51.479 --> 12:53.856
<i>Shohei mapped out his goals
on a "dream board."</i>

12:55.399 --> 12:59.737
<i>His dream was
to be drafted first by 8 pro teams,</i>

13:00.488 --> 13:04.241
<i>which he planned to achieve by</i>

13:05.785 --> 13:12.374
<i>perfecting 8 factors of his game,
each with 8 smaller goals.</i>

13:13.042 --> 13:18.214
<i>This included physicality,
mentality, luck, control,</i>

13:19.089 --> 13:20.925
<i>and humanity amongst others.</i>

14:33.789 --> 14:35.291
This is embarrassing.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.545
Honestly... that was...

14:40.087 --> 14:44.550
That was supposed to be something
between just me and myself.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.220
I wasn't ready for that to be exposed.

14:48.971 --> 14:55.144
I had hoped to keep that locked in a place
where no one could find it.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.984
2010? He would have been in high school.

15:04.987 --> 15:09.116
First of all,
to be "drafted first by 8 teams..."

15:10.659 --> 15:13.537
I never had a goal that big.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.458
He wrote this in his freshman year?

15:19.752 --> 15:24.715
I doubt any other players in the league
could come up with a plan like this.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.879
In the early stage,
I think it helps to put in writing.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.925
People have a tendency to forget.

16:08.050 --> 16:12.596
Writing and posting notes where you
can see them is a simple act,

16:12.721 --> 16:14.223
but I think it's effective.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.686
As you continue what you've written,

16:19.269 --> 16:24.274
the things you need to do
will eventually become second nature.

16:25.025 --> 16:30.614
There're many ways to go about it.
It's not about which one is right.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.908
This is simply one approach.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.161
I think it's worthwhile.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.652
It's just what came to mind.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.696
I wasn't trying to think too hard.

17:13.240 --> 17:18.369
It was simply a list
of what was important to me at that time.

17:18.579 --> 17:23.166
I chose and wrote down what
I saw as being necessary.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.671
That's really all that was.

17:31.508 --> 17:36.263
<i>At 6, Shohei wrote that his
favorite sport was baseball.</i>

17:38.307 --> 17:41.268
<i>His dream job was to be a baseball player.</i>

17:42.853 --> 17:46.899
<i>And as an adult,
he wanted to be "ordinary."</i>

17:52.654 --> 17:54.573
This is from first grade?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.288
This really surprises me.

18:01.413 --> 18:07.377
You'll have to ask him why he wrote this.
I wonder what's behind his words.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.713
I'd love to know the answer.

18:10.130 --> 18:15.594
Does it mean, as a first grader,
he already felt that he wasn't ordinary?

18:17.096 --> 18:21.683
There must've been something
that made him stand out from others.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.270
What impresses me
is that even as a first grader,

18:26.146 --> 18:32.945
he has an understanding about humility,
that you shouldn't brag about yourself.

18:34.363 --> 18:38.534
It shows how he knew that actions
speak louder than words.

18:38.700 --> 18:43.914
His parents deserve even more credit
for what they've taught him.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.019
I was just a normal kid.

19:06.728 --> 19:10.482
A slightly larger-than-average kid.

19:11.650 --> 19:16.280
Actually, I was probably way larger
than average in middle school.

19:19.658 --> 19:25.372
<i>At 18, Shohei was scouted
to be a pitcher in the US.</i>

19:26.039 --> 19:31.920
<i>However, a pro team in Japan made
an offer that caught his attention.</i>

19:33.297 --> 19:37.426
<i>He was given the chance to be both
a pitcher and a hitter,</i>

19:37.885 --> 19:41.305
<i>something that hadn't
been seen in over a century.</i>

20:52.292 --> 20:58.298
The offer to play as a two-way player
first came from the Nippon-Ham Fighters.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.720
Initially, I had hoped to go directly
to the US after high school.

21:05.013 --> 21:08.141
Back then, aside from the Fighters,

21:08.267 --> 21:14.398
all of the other Japanese teams
only wanted me as a pitcher.

21:14.856 --> 21:18.986
There were also offers from some US teams,

21:19.444 --> 21:23.031
but they also only saw me as a pitcher.

21:23.907 --> 21:30.872
It was very clear that no one really
seemed interested in me as a hitter.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.503
So the Fighters were the only team
to propose such an idea.

21:37.963 --> 21:41.925
I thought it through and made my choice.

21:45.178 --> 21:51.518
In the end, that was the path
I decided to pursue in my career.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.271
It's important to develop your own style.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.357
As I listened to Shohei,

21:57.649 --> 22:02.654
I could see that he was more
confident as a hitter than a pitcher.

22:03.071 --> 22:08.368
It seems he had been aware of the choices
he was making from the beginning.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.249
So in that sense,

22:15.167 --> 22:19.713
it appeared that he was the one who wanted
to continue on his own volition,

22:19.838 --> 22:25.761
and the Fighters provided the environment
for him to pursue his challenge.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.347
That's very intriguing to me.

22:36.855 --> 22:43.195
Since Shohei couldn't have been posted
to MLB without the Fighters' approval,

22:43.987 --> 22:47.407
I'm sure he had discussed it
for a number of years.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.868
That's definitely not the case
at a professional level.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.911
It's possible until high school.

24:16.997 --> 24:21.543
In high school, they don't play games
every day like the pros do.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.671
Maybe at a tournament, it could happen.

24:25.088 --> 24:28.800
At the high school level,

24:29.217 --> 24:34.931
a player who can play any position, pitch,
and hit well is likely to lead the team.

24:35.557 --> 24:41.897
Once you reach the professional level,
you have to make a decision.

24:42.439 --> 24:46.318
It's very normal to choose
a specialty to focus on.

24:46.902 --> 24:52.199
The biggest reason was their proposal
to let me try both.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.035
I hadn't thought of that possibility.

24:56.161 --> 25:00.874
Until then, there weren't any teams that
considered me as a hitter.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.753
Amidst all this,
when Kuriyama-san suggested that I

25:05.045 --> 25:10.884
try both, it got me thinking,
"I could give it a try."

25:11.134 --> 25:14.763
That's where the whole conversation began.

25:16.139 --> 25:22.395
Had he chosen one position, I assume
he would've thrived in the US much sooner.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.773
When it came to doing both,

25:26.858 --> 25:30.237
there was a question
of how far he could really go.

25:31.404 --> 25:35.575
I wanted him to truly excel at both,
at a level where

25:35.867 --> 25:38.620
he can compete in the MLB.

25:38.703 --> 25:43.625
He had the potential, and I was
determined to get him to that level.

25:45.835 --> 25:48.129
I sometimes wonder...

25:50.215 --> 25:55.971
Was he truly convinced that I could
genuinely become a two-way player?

25:56.513 --> 26:02.143
I would love to know the truth
about what he thought back then.

26:02.561 --> 26:09.526
I see him as one of
the very few people who believed in me,

26:10.193 --> 26:13.822
but did he see it as a
100% attainable goal?

26:13.989 --> 26:15.699
Or maybe, at that point,

26:15.991 --> 26:21.913
the team was just trying to
test things out and see the outcome.

26:22.706 --> 26:29.462
When I chose to join the MLB, some members
of the ballclub actually told me,

26:30.130 --> 26:33.425
"We never really thought you could do it."

26:33.925 --> 26:39.180
I can totally understand.
So perhaps, for Kuriyama-san as well,

26:39.598 --> 26:44.936
it's understandable if it was simply
a strategy to recruit me to their team.

26:45.145 --> 26:48.565
If I failed to do both,
I could opt for just one.

26:48.940 --> 26:53.653
I knew those were generally
the expectations around me back then,

26:56.281 --> 27:00.869
but I was willing to take a bet
on my determination to make it work.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.290
It naturally makes me wonder
Kuriyama-san's... well...

27:06.458 --> 27:09.252
His true intention at that time.

27:10.045 --> 27:14.049
How much faith did
he have in my potential?

27:17.510 --> 27:23.183
<i>From the Fighters' perspective,
I can see it was a win-win either way.</i>

27:23.391 --> 27:27.812
<i>Either of the results should have
been a success for them.</i>

27:27.937 --> 27:32.525
If my hitting failed,
they could simply use me as a pitcher.

27:33.068 --> 27:38.406
Once drafted, I would be at the mercy
of whatever the team decided to do.

27:39.532 --> 27:43.244
Given that, I figured I might as well
take the chance.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.498
I felt I could pull it off.

27:46.873 --> 27:50.835
I was happy to have
the opportunity to prove it.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.888
I was very sure he could do it.

28:01.971 --> 28:04.724
Shohei as a hitter and a pitcher,

28:04.849 --> 28:09.437
I had no doubt that both aspects of
him would be the best in Japan.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.190
That was one side of my intention.

28:12.691 --> 28:16.569
Mr. Yoshimura,
the GM of the Fighters back then, and I

28:16.653 --> 28:20.115
had extensive talks
and came to a conclusion.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.491
We had five years.

28:21.866 --> 28:25.078
If Shohei didn't make it
to the MLB in five years,

28:25.537 --> 28:26.746
then we'd failed him.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.707
That's how much talent he had.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.418
That's how we went about it.

28:37.465 --> 28:41.386
My ultimate dream was to make it
as a player in the MLB.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.348
While that final goal didn't change,

28:46.808 --> 28:50.812
another dream emerged within me.

28:50.895 --> 28:54.107
To become a successful two-way player.

28:55.191 --> 29:01.740
With a new aspiration, I aimed to thrive
as a two-way player on the global stage.

29:09.539 --> 29:13.001
Darvish-san had left
the Fighters before I joined.

29:13.710 --> 29:18.214
So I ended up inheriting
his jersey number 11.

29:18.798 --> 29:22.051
- <i>There was some tension there.</i>
- There was.

29:22.719 --> 29:27.891
Some people thought it was too early
for the number 11 to be passed on.

29:28.057 --> 29:31.019
It's a special number to the team,

29:31.102 --> 29:35.648
<i>and to Darvish-san.
It was an honor to get to wear it.</i>

29:37.484 --> 29:40.737
It felt different from any other number.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.866
Yes, there were some issues about this.

29:45.658 --> 29:50.497
I knew that the scouts and the team
had done their research on Shohei,

29:51.080 --> 29:54.292
and it showed how high
their expectations were.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.545
Number 11 isn't mine to begin with.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.424
It was just the number I pitched with.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.094
Some said, "Shohei hasn't earned it yet."

30:05.261 --> 30:07.847
But I never saw it that way.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.224
Rather,

30:09.682 --> 30:15.647
I knew the team valued the number.
So, when they passed it to him so soon,

30:15.814 --> 30:21.611
it made me very excited and eager to see
the kind of exceptional player he was.

30:54.561 --> 30:59.816
While people know how hard it is
to become a professional ball player,

30:59.983 --> 31:03.862
Shohei needs to work twice
as much to reach that level.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.281
His ability wasn't the issue.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.908
His body would be
the one to reach its limit.

31:09.033 --> 31:13.204
I had to figure out
how to balance the two.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.832
That was one of the crucial points.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.585
I never told Shohei what he needed to do.

31:18.668 --> 31:22.547
As he kept pushing forward,
I was just there for him,

31:22.755 --> 31:26.634
making sure he had
a clear path to move on.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.805
He was doing his thing.
My job was to back him up.

31:30.972 --> 31:35.810
What he was trying to achieve
wasn't something you can teach.

31:43.985 --> 31:47.864
<i>102.5 mph, a new record!</i>

32:03.046 --> 32:06.591
<i>At the Nippon-Ham Fighters,</i>

32:07.091 --> 32:14.057
<i>Shohei broke the boundaries and records in
hopes of one day making it to the majors.</i>

32:52.387 --> 32:58.017
Maybe he thought he had what it took.
He felt he could pull it off.

32:59.644 --> 33:05.191
But I think he was more driven by the idea
of doing what no one else had.

33:05.525 --> 33:09.362
At least for me,
that would have been the case.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.658
You'll never know until you try.

33:14.701 --> 33:17.495
Going for what nobody's done before...

33:17.745 --> 33:21.791
Maybe 100 years ago, there might've been
players doing both.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.837
But in today's competitive world,

33:25.962 --> 33:29.841
attempting and achieving
what's never been done?

33:30.800 --> 33:36.097
The challenge itself must've been
the biggest drive for him.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.934
Even if you fail,
it's still worth the ride.

33:41.644 --> 33:46.149
After 5, 6, or 7 years,
I was sure he'd be physically ready

33:46.274 --> 33:49.277
to handle this tough challenge.

33:49.610 --> 33:54.032
For that period while he was building up,
he mustn't overdo it.

33:54.157 --> 33:59.203
This was a crucial rule for me,
but Shohei sometimes fought back.

33:59.328 --> 34:03.374
He'd insist on playing,
especially for important games.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.335
We had a lot of
those exchanges over email.

34:06.502 --> 34:10.797
However, it was my role
to stop him when I needed to.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.551
In order to succeed in the MLB,

34:14.010 --> 34:17.013
he had to build
a solid foundation in Japan.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.141
I truly believed that
was his shortest path.

34:20.349 --> 34:25.521
I was sure that Shohei would understand,
and he eventually did.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.485
However, whether my approach
truly succeeded or not,

34:31.819 --> 34:35.614
we'll only know when
Shohei stops playing baseball.

34:36.114 --> 34:41.120
I honestly can't tell
which was the right path to choose.

34:41.245 --> 34:46.958
I believe that going directly to
the US should be a viable option.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.505
I really can't say which is better.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.092
For me, it wasn't much
about staying in Japan,

34:54.425 --> 34:58.888
it was more about the opportunity
to be a two-way player.

36:01.701 --> 36:06.664
Well, when it comes to something
that you really want to achieve,

36:07.665 --> 36:12.044
there would always be some kind
of criticism you need to face.

36:12.587 --> 36:18.050
There would always be an obstacle
that you need to overcome.

36:19.343 --> 36:24.682
At the end of the day,
I know myself better than anyone else,

36:25.600 --> 36:30.146
and no one knows what I'm
striving for better than I do.

36:30.730 --> 36:35.860
I think I'll only be able to
reflect on what I dedicated myself to

36:36.611 --> 36:42.116
at the end of my career, after
giving everything I have as a player.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.745
From what I know of Shohei,

36:47.288 --> 36:52.960
he has always been very sure of himself,
even from a very young age.

36:53.085 --> 36:59.091
I know he's not the kind of person
that would be easily deterred.

37:13.105 --> 37:19.153
The most important factor was how serious
they were about me playing both positions.

37:20.529 --> 37:25.701
Given the limited time and few meetings,

37:25.868 --> 37:30.539
it wasn't really possible
to fully gauge their intentions.

37:30.831 --> 37:35.503
But in the end, I had conversations
with a few teams and decided.

37:44.720 --> 37:50.559
I thought he would end up choosing
either the Rangers or the Padres,

37:50.643 --> 37:54.522
but he surprised everyone
and signed with the Angels.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.441
I never had a chance
to find out his reasons.

38:18.713 --> 38:23.301
To be really honest,
I went with my gut feeling.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.553
When I chose my high school,

38:26.554 --> 38:29.765
when I first decided
to try for the MLB at 18,

38:30.016 --> 38:35.563
and when I ended up with the Fighters,
my decision was made the same way.

38:36.063 --> 38:38.941
In the end, I rely on my intuition.

38:40.318 --> 38:45.740
That might sound arbitrary but it isn't.

38:47.116 --> 38:51.078
For example, if I'm given three options,

38:52.455 --> 38:54.290
I'll look at all three,

38:54.915 --> 39:00.212
and examine every aspect of them
so I can truly understand what I'm given.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.922
But at the end of the day,

39:02.423 --> 39:05.885
I go with what feels right to me.
That's how it works.

39:06.635 --> 39:10.931
It's a little bit difficult to explain.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.642
It's similar to your batting stance.

39:15.019 --> 39:19.357
It's about choosing what matches
the vision of your future self.

39:19.440 --> 39:23.277
When considering what could be
the best decision

39:23.402 --> 39:27.073
for both myself and those around me,

39:27.615 --> 39:30.534
the Angels just seemed
to stand out the most.

39:30.618 --> 39:32.578
That's the main reason.

39:33.162 --> 39:37.291
Of course, there were
the meetings along the way,

39:38.209 --> 39:40.795
I talked to people from various teams.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.256
So I believe my intuition was based on

39:45.716 --> 39:52.390
all of those meetings and conversations
I had prior to making my decision.

39:52.723 --> 39:57.645
Ultimately, it led to my
decision to go with the Angels.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.980
His gut feeling?

40:01.524 --> 40:04.777
I expected a more
specific reason than that,

40:05.861 --> 40:10.282
although going with your gut
doesn't sound bad at all.

40:10.783 --> 40:15.413
It's your life. Relying on
your intuition might work the best.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.452
Starting next year,

41:37.369 --> 41:41.290
I would like to formally announce that...

41:42.208 --> 41:47.296
I plan to go and do my best in the USA.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.968
<i>After 5 years in Japan,</i>

41:53.594 --> 41:58.140
<i>Shohei finally decided to come to the US.</i>

41:59.934 --> 42:02.770
<i>He had chosen the Los Angeles Angels.</i>

43:10.379 --> 43:15.467
The spring training in 2018 was
a disaster. My results were terrible.

43:16.677 --> 43:20.973
But in a way,
that's what I had signed up for.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.726
Time is limited for a pro baseball player.

43:25.394 --> 43:29.273
If I make it to 50,
that would be a miracle in itself.

43:29.982 --> 43:36.572
I want to dedicate my time and push
my limits to see how far I can go.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.575
You could say that it's sort of my hobby.

43:39.658 --> 43:43.704
While I struggled with my hitting,

43:43.787 --> 43:46.290
I was also excited and aspired
to achieve results.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.251
I didn't expect to do
well right off the bat.

43:49.835 --> 43:55.466
That goes for when I entered high school,
or when I started playing professionally.

43:55.591 --> 44:01.805
It almost never went well from the start,
but it was my decision to be there.

44:02.765 --> 44:08.312
The excitement of following my dream
outweighs any of those difficult times.

45:16.380 --> 45:21.427
I felt like I was stuck
during spring training.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.345
How can I say this...

45:24.138 --> 45:29.893
I'm not really the kind of person who
likes to ask other people for their help.

45:30.644 --> 45:34.690
There were moments at camp when
I felt hopeless.

45:34.773 --> 45:39.194
But in the end, I trusted myself
and what I've always done.

45:39.361 --> 45:41.697
It was still spring training,

45:41.780 --> 45:46.076
I had enough time and was
open to making adjustments.

45:46.201 --> 45:50.497
I made big changes in my swing
and tweaked many things.

45:51.123 --> 45:54.001
That's how I've managed to get this far.

48:13.098 --> 48:17.853
We've built a great relationship so far.

48:17.936 --> 48:24.735
We enjoy working together every day.
I'm confident I made the right choice.

48:25.319 --> 48:31.450
I'm very relieved to hear that.
What I constantly tried to tell Shohei,

48:31.867 --> 48:37.164
even when he headed to the US, is that
"What matters is what Shohei decides."

48:37.456 --> 48:42.377
Whatever you decide to do,
the gods of baseball will support you.

48:43.170 --> 48:47.424
I told him not to get caught up in
what others tell him to do.

48:48.091 --> 48:53.013
Looking at him making his own decisions
and trusting in himself,

48:53.805 --> 48:56.892
it genuinely makes me happy.

49:32.386 --> 49:36.056
For rookies or players
with limited MLB experience,

49:36.306 --> 49:39.226
this might seem exaggerated,

49:39.559 --> 49:43.605
but it often feels
like you have no rights.

49:43.730 --> 49:47.526
People will nitpick everything you do.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.862
All I wanted was to play baseball here,

49:51.947 --> 49:55.867
so I had a tough time
understanding that mentality.

51:06.271 --> 51:11.860
I had put in my time with the Fighters.
I developed my own routine and style,

51:11.985 --> 51:16.114
and I believe it was on that basis
I was signed on.

51:16.698 --> 51:21.286
Yet, back then, I often got
laughed at when I did things my way.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.456
It was a tough time for me.

51:25.832 --> 51:32.714
The MLB has made big changes since then.
Today's clubhouse has a different energy.

51:32.839 --> 51:37.010
But those first few years were
a real struggle for me.

51:37.552 --> 51:41.348
There were many times
I wanted to return to the Fighters.

52:35.944 --> 52:40.657
In my case...
I haven't been through it myself.

52:40.740 --> 52:44.953
I've never played for another MLB team,
so I can't say for sure.

52:45.871 --> 52:51.543
But you do hear rumors,
and you take those in as information.

52:52.043 --> 52:56.631
Because you're a rookie or Asian,
things can unfold in certain ways.

52:57.716 --> 53:03.346
Since I tend to inflate my
assumptions negatively

53:03.471 --> 53:08.602
and often expect the worst,
that was what I was prepared for.

53:10.312 --> 53:15.275
But that wasn't the case.
They were all really nice people.

53:16.026 --> 53:18.361
It's true, how do I put it...

53:18.904 --> 53:22.240
Everyone is very easy to work with.

53:22.490 --> 53:25.202
I've never had any negative feelings

53:26.328 --> 53:29.039
when it comes to relationships.

53:29.122 --> 53:33.668
I'm definitely lucky.
I find it a very good environment for me.

53:33.835 --> 53:38.173
There have been tough times,
including injuries,

53:38.506 --> 53:44.763
but I'm very happy being able
to come this far as a part of this team.

54:45.407 --> 54:50.662
Fortunately, I haven't really
encountered those kind of issues.

54:50.787 --> 54:55.709
I had a different outlook.
I expected I'd be dealing with a lot more.

54:57.460 --> 55:02.007
Especially among Angels fans,
there's a homey vibe.

55:02.090 --> 55:07.846
They made me feel very welcomed
and supported me a lot.

55:08.972 --> 55:14.352
That's one of the reasons why
I was able to focus on my performance.

55:14.436 --> 55:19.274
I consider myself very lucky
and thankful for my situation.

55:19.858 --> 55:24.404
I am surrounded by
an incredible support group.

55:24.487 --> 55:29.701
Having Ippei-san help with
the translation has been a big asset.

55:29.784 --> 55:31.202
I consider his presence crucial.

55:31.286 --> 55:38.043
You never know when a statement
might be received differently.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.378
For example, when it comes to jokes.

55:40.462 --> 55:44.341
They can easily backfire
due to misinterpretation.

55:44.466 --> 55:50.972
He's very good at capturing nuances
when he translates for me.

55:51.056 --> 55:54.642
That has been definitely a huge help.

55:55.143 --> 56:00.565
By the time Shohei came in 2018, things
had greatly improved in every team.

56:00.815 --> 56:05.362
There was an ethical shift towards
accepting one another.

56:05.737 --> 56:11.284
So I can't really say if he had
a similar experience as mine.

56:11.701 --> 56:15.830
But in Shohei's case,
I am sure he had his rough time.

56:15.955 --> 56:19.250
His injury in the midst of
all that media attention

56:19.334 --> 56:23.004
mustn't have been easy for him.

56:45.026 --> 56:50.448
<i>Even then, Shohei's path in the major
was filled with twists and turns.</i>

59:01.663 --> 59:07.919
After the Tommy John surgery in 2019,
the following year was also a struggle.

59:08.086 --> 59:12.549
I didn't feel that
I was recovering how I should.

59:13.341 --> 59:15.093
I started to doubt.

59:16.052 --> 59:22.725
I thought it might be better to focus
on one position to obtain results.

59:23.059 --> 59:29.399
That was the time when I honestly
considered dropping the two-way path.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:06.603
There's one thing
I didn't get the chance to ask Joe.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:13.484
Back in spring training in 2021,
I was called into the manager's office.

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:18.364
I was told there would be
no more rules for me, and

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:22.285
they'd play me without
any restrictions that season.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:28.249
Joe was there along with
our GM, Perry Minasian.

01:00:30.084 --> 01:00:33.421
When I first heard them tell me that,

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:36.549
how do I put this?

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:40.970
I sort of figured they were
giving me an ultimatum.

01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:46.768
That this might be my last chance
to prove I could play two-way.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:53.358
At least that's how I took
the conversation we had in that room.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:01:01.366
Obviously, I can't be sure what was
on their minds.

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:05.620
Maybe they meant
"We are counting on you," or

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:10.166
it could've been a final warning.

01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:17.298
As a player, that's not something
you can ask the manager about.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:20.426
But now that he's not in charge anymore,

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:26.099
perhaps this is an occasion
for me to approach him directly.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:13.146
I'm glad to hear that.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:18.609
So there wasn't any underlying meaning
to what they told me.

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:22.739
I misunderstood their intentions.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:28.870
However, I think that extra pressure
actually helped me to perform better.

01:02:29.203 --> 01:02:35.042
I was really disappointed with my
performance in the 2019 and 2020 seasons.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:42.133
I could understand if they felt
things weren't going as they had hoped.

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:49.056
So, I entered spring training
in 2021 with a strong determination.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:55.104
Turns out the management
had faith in me just as they said.

01:02:56.647 --> 01:03:01.360
Wanting to meet those expectations,
I had a great season.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:06.949
I think it worked out for the better
that I misunderstood their words.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:33.536
If you ask me,

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.999
from the perspective of the manager,

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:46.424
for better or worse, I'm just
one piece for him to use in the game.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:54.098
That's merely a
simplified way to look at it.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:05:00.521
With 30 teams in the league, there are
only 30 managerial positions,

01:05:01.188 --> 01:05:04.108
while there are many players out there.

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.778
When it comes to strategy,

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:14.035
or perhaps the ability to lead a team,
the managers look at the big picture.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:19.457
Their impact on the team is far greater
than any individual player.

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:24.420
I'm sure that's something I can't handle,

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:28.633
and I find their role
absolutely remarkable.

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:33.012
It's not just a matter of respect,
it's more than that.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:37.683
They're extraordinary.
There's so much to learn from them.

01:05:39.518 --> 01:05:41.938
At least, that's how I see it.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:37.636
I agree. That's the fundamental
reason why I play baseball.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.098
When it comes down to it,

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.018
baseball is...

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:47.938
Even though baseball is my profession,

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:54.070
that's not all it is to me.
It's more than a career.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:08:00.701
Whether it's playing catch or
hitting a pitch, it's what I love to do.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:04.997
My love for the sport is what
has driven me to this point.

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:11.712
Baseball has given me a purpose.
It's become a way of life.

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:16.425
And this sentiment largely
defines who I am today.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.386
To be honest,

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:26.519
I don't really know what kind
of influence I have on other people,

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.732
but I hope it's positive in some way.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:39.657
That would be the reason enough
to keep doing what I do right now.

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.424
I see it differently.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.970
He's achieved something no one else has.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.184
How should I put it?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:53.104
Calling him a "seeker of baseball"
might not be quite right,

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:59.570
but I believe the journey he's on
will inspire future generations.

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:04.033
Sorry, Shohei, but keep pushing forward.
That's my genuine wish.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:09.205
When he and I trained together,

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.543
I ended up learning a lot from him.

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:21.258
The speed at which he improved was on
a different level from anyone else.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.554
Looking back now,

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:33.145
I've never encountered another athlete who
is already outstanding yet aims higher.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:39.777
I'm very grateful to have shared such
an experience with him.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.154
It was a privilege.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:50.454
We won't truly understand
the extent of his success until he's done.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.414
Everything looks great now,

01:10:52.706 --> 01:10:53.707
but at times,

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:58.879
I question whether I really
made the right choices.

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:07.846
All I can say is,
I believe I've made the right choices.

01:11:07.972 --> 01:11:10.015
Once you make a decision,

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:17.564
it sets you on a unique path,
which leads you to a distinct experience.

01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:24.405
And you can never compare it
to what other options might have brought.

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.616
You've only got one path to take.

01:11:28.742 --> 01:11:33.122
I've had bad seasons. I was injured.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:39.545
But looking back at everything,
I'm happy with the choices I made.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.171
As for the future,

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.758
whenever I make a decision,

01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:51.140
I'll reflect on it and believe it was
the right call, and work to make it true.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:12:00.024
<i>Despite all of the hardships,
Shohei persevered.</i>

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:15.391
<i>In 2021, he unanimously won
the American League MVP award.</i>

01:13:15.599 --> 01:13:19.603
<i>The following year, he was runner-up.</i>

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:24.650
<i>He became one of the best players
in all of the MLB.</i>

01:13:55.389 --> 01:14:00.519
Shohei isn't afraid of
challenging himself in a way I can't.

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:06.233
I recognize that and see it
as a quality I wish I had.

01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:13.323
I've never faced him in a game, but
I'm eager to know what it would be like.

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:19.496
I wonder how I would react
once I step into the batter's box.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:23.041
I'm really looking forward to that moment.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:30.382
I get anxious when I struggle throwing
strikes and keep pitching balls.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:36.263
I don't know if Shohei feels
the same anxiety in those situations,

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:40.476
but he pitches as if
he's totally unbothered.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:32.945
Simply put, I imagine what would
throw me off if I was the pitcher.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:39.034
When I'm pitching, it's the opposite.
I do what would bother me as a batter.

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:44.248
I think that's probably a different
approach from other players.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:50.295
But I still need more experience.
Things have changed since my first year.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:57.719
My pitching varies based on who
the batter is and which team he's from.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:00.973
My mentality is also affected.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:04.810
As Pedro said,
I need to gain more experience.

01:16:05.769 --> 01:16:09.189
Batters adapt to any
changes pitcher makes.

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:13.527
Since Shohei is the only player
in such a circumstance,

01:16:13.735 --> 01:16:17.698
only he knows how being a pitcher
benefits him as a batter.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:24.538
I've never considered limiting
myself to just one role,

01:16:25.122 --> 01:16:28.500
so I'm not sure which approach is better.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:32.838
But I can say that I always have two
things to think about.

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.716
And I simply enjoy that.

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:44.141
<i>In 2023, Shohei wrote
a new chapter in his story.</i>

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:30.187
Shohei messaged me to see if I would
consider participating in the WBC.

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:37.027
He said he wasn't confident enough
to win the championship without my help.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:43.575
It's not that I was flattered
by what he said.

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:48.830
Despite his consistent performance,
he's still hungry for more.

01:17:49.539 --> 01:17:52.668
The WBC is unrelated to
the regular season.

01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:56.296
Just how much does he want to win?

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.799
I guess he truly loves it.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.928
I think it was already
August when he reached out to me,

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:06.807
but his hunger
for victory really struck me.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:09.810
If you play long enough,

01:18:09.976 --> 01:18:13.271
that kind of spirit fades away.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:18.402
You start to see baseball more
from a business perspective.

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:25.701
Even in a contract year, fully aware
of the importance of his health,

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:29.788
he still took the risk of the tournament.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:34.918
He said he wanted the title
and needed to beat the US team.

01:18:35.085 --> 01:18:38.547
He usually doesn't let
people know his emotion,

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:42.092
but his determination
was clear in his messages.

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:45.155
Near the end of the game, I checked
if he still had enough stamina to play.

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:49.034
He gave a vague reply, like "Probably."

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:52.913
I knew he meant, "Send me out to close."

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:40.126
WORLD CHAMPION

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:55.851
We had two outs and no runners on base.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:21:00.105
By the time Mike Trout came up to bat,

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:05.485
it felt like the momentum was on our side.

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:19.708
The count was full.

01:21:19.791 --> 01:21:25.005
Reflecting on my pitch selection and
how the game had unfolded,

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.007
I felt everything was in place.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:34.306
I sensed that the game was heading
to a close with me striking Mike out.

01:22:14.429 --> 01:22:16.097
From this tournament,

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:23.063
it's clear Shohei has now become a figure
even MLB stars look up to.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:27.692
When I first saw him play in high school,

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:31.696
I instantly noticed that he was special.

01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:36.159
The future was in his hands, and
the sky seemed to be his only limit.

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:41.790
My impression began to take shape during
his time with the Fighters.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:48.588
Now, I feel he's reached a point where his
physical condition is no longer a concern.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.091
I believe he feels the same way.

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:54.928
I'm finally seeing what I had
always believed.

01:22:56.596 --> 01:23:02.894
That incredibly talented high schooler
has become a fully-fledged player.

01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:04.854
That's my sentiment now.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:09.234
I don't see myself as having done
any favors for him.

01:23:09.734 --> 01:23:13.238
I was just one of the many cogs

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:17.659
in a machine
naturally drawn to support him.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.649
<i>At the WBC,</i>

01:23:49.774 --> 01:23:55.321
<i>Shohei finally became
a world champion baseball player.</i>

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:10.253
<i>Now that he has won the WBC,</i>

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:14.632
<i>is he still writing down his dreams?</i>

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:22.932
I don't write down my dreams
like I used to.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:29.397
But writing does help remind you
of things you need to remember,

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.192
especially technical details.

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:35.070
When it comes to baseball,

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:41.242
your skills might progress one day
but deteriorate the next.

01:24:41.367 --> 01:24:45.163
Just because it worked today
doesn't mean it's right.

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:49.125
So I still keep track
of my technical records.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:54.089
I find those notes to be very useful
when I want to reflect on myself.

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:59.135
Ideally, basic values shouldn't need
to be written down,

01:24:59.302 --> 01:25:02.514
Like making eye contact when greeting.

01:25:03.014 --> 01:25:09.104
If you feel it hasn't become a habit
for you yet, I recommend writing it down.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:13.191
When you look at your note,
it will always remind you to do so.

01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:16.069
This is an effective process.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:21.282
Once that habit becomes a part of you,
you no longer need your notes.

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:26.788
And this is really the ideal outcome
for every process you make.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:32.544
I have a feeling he still keeps a list
of his current tasks.

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.755
He probably wouldn't share
it with anyone now,

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:40.009
but perhaps in 10 years,
he might reveal it to us.

01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:44.931
<i>At 18, Shohei wrote,</i>

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:50.687
<i>"Life doesn't make dreams,
dream makes life."</i>

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.606
<i>"My life is for baseball."</i>

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:17.297
Given Shohei's
extraordinary achievements in baseball

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:23.136
and his relentless dedication to it
even in his daily life,

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:28.516
I doubt there's anyone who can
tell him what he should do.

01:26:29.225 --> 01:26:30.810
Perhaps Joe Maddon?

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:04.844
I think what awaits Shohei,

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.931
he will figure it out himself naturally.

01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:12.852
If he's committing 100% to baseball now,

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.647
that's his current priority.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.982
Then someday,

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:25.573
he may look back at his path and
recall these times of full dedication.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:31.913
If he does, I believe it's
a wonderful thing for him.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.792
There are very few
players who can do the same.

01:27:37.543 --> 01:27:43.758
I understand managers have
seen much more of life than we have.

01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:49.430
I'm sure they've witnessed many players
burn out along the way.

01:27:50.473 --> 01:27:54.936
But Shohei has done something
everyone thought was impossible.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:28:01.693
Even if it's Joe Maddon's advice,
Shohei doesn't have to comply.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:06.406
At this stage in his career,
and if he wants to keep going,

01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:10.535
I don't see any reason
to change what he is doing.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.332
That's exactly right.

01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:24.590
I do have a vision for my future,
but nothing is set in stone.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:32.307
Sure, thinking about the
future is important,

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:38.479
but it's a separate matter from
what I should be doing at this moment.

01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:42.233
For me, it's all about being all in on

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:46.487
what feels right in my life right now.

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:24.817
Shohei keeps on doing the unexpected.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:31.783
He's on a path no one's ever been on,
and that's beyond our imagination.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:38.539
I'm convinced that he's going to
blow us away even more in the future.

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:43.461
Ever since I started playing,

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:47.090
I've just followed a series of steps.

01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:52.637
Those little steps simply led
to a much larger goal.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.766
I still have goals and aspirations
that I've yet to achieve.

01:29:57.725 --> 01:30:01.479
That's what keeps me moving forward.

01:30:02.188 --> 01:30:04.565
He needs to win the World Series.

01:30:04.690 --> 01:30:10.530
I've always believed he could round out as
a three-way player with defense.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.783
I totally have faith in him for that.

01:31:11.007 --> 01:31:13.634
Thank you. There's a message too.

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:18.598
I'll put it up with Matsui-san's ball.

01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:26.772
He's not just a top Japanese player,
he's one of the greatest in the MLB.

01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:32.862
He brings back the feeling I had as
a child when I watched the top players.

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:40.036
At this point, I'm content with the
decisions I made along the way.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:45.082
I'm part of a great team, working together

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:47.960
with outstanding players every day.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:51.088
But was it the absolute best decision?

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:58.596
Unless I could go back in time
and try out the other options I had,

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.806
I'd never know for sure.

01:32:01.432 --> 01:32:04.352
I often say this, but

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:09.649
all you can do is trust your past
decisions were the best ones at the time.

01:32:09.732 --> 01:32:14.362
That mindset allows me
to truly enjoy the game.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:18.241
I genuinely believe that.

01:32:19.283 --> 01:32:22.161
When it comes to deciding what's the best,

01:32:22.286 --> 01:32:29.210
all I know is that whatever I choose
for myself is the right choice for me.

01:33:28.769 --> 01:33:31.147
He's pursued his dreams this far,

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:42.199
but I wish to let him know that the future
of baseball now rests on his shoulders.

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:47.830
I know he can take on that mantle.

01:33:53.336 --> 01:33:56.631
WORLD CHAMPION
