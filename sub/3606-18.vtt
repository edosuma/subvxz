00:00.634 --> 00:04.737
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.805 --> 00:07.740
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.242 --> 00:10.275
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.277 --> 00:12.011
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:15.881
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:15.883 --> 00:17.750
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.752 --> 00:22.554
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:26.025
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:29.628
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.630 --> 00:31.463
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:34.166
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.603 --> 00:38.370
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.472
Cat:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.474 --> 00:41.640
<i> Livewire.</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:44.410
Water and electricity,
never a good match.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.279
I saw Jeremiah at
project cadmus.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.847
I'm going
to get him back.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.115
We're gonna
get him back.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.252
Non: <i> Myriad works.</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:56.522
And, very soon, astra's dream
for what earth can become
will be reality.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.758
This is over, James.
You love her.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.027
I would be jealous of
anyone you loved.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.896
James, I...

01:03.898 --> 01:05.764
Don't. I need a little time.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.866
(Grunting)

01:07.868 --> 01:09.134
Thank you.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.469
Supergirl:
<i> My brain was altered.</i>

01:10.471 --> 01:12.137
<i> I scared the whole city...</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:15.274
And now I'm so afraid
that I'm never gonna
win them back.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.577
You are fired!

01:18.579 --> 01:21.980
That blond mean
girl ratted me out
to the queen of all media.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.916
I just want to scream...

01:23.918 --> 01:26.118
(Screaming)

01:27.855 --> 01:29.121
(Screams)

01:30.357 --> 01:31.423
(Gasps)

01:33.227 --> 01:35.194
(Machine whirring)

01:35.196 --> 01:36.528
What is she?

01:36.530 --> 01:39.131
She's definitely not
a fort rozz escapee.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.100
Trust me. We checked.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.235
And you're sure you don't
recognize her from Krypton?

01:43.237 --> 01:45.804
No. But it was a big place.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.306
We didn't all know each other.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.441
She fell four stories, Kara.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.976
There's not a scratch on her.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.313
The only other person
i know capable of that is you.

01:54.315 --> 01:59.118
Well, maybe she should be
national city's new hero.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.388
I saw that, uh, winning
the people back
wasn't going so well.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.557
I have tried
everything I can think of.

02:05.559 --> 02:09.294
Last night I helped a family
assemble their Ikea table.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.596
It's still not enough.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.099
One mistake.

02:14.101 --> 02:17.736
That's all it took to
just erase all the
good I did before.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.171
You were poisoned.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.372
It's, it's not your fault.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.807
People don't know that.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.275
All they know is that this
symbol doesn't mean

02:23.277 --> 02:25.177
what it used to anymore.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.680
Dr. Hamilton, how is Siobhan?

02:28.682 --> 02:32.518
How did she survive her
belly flop on the sidewalk?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.653
She emitted a high frequency
sound wave so powerful,

02:34.655 --> 02:38.357
it literally cushioned her
fall and pulverized
the cement.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.327
You're saying the girl
that I have been...

02:43.497 --> 02:45.797
(Stammering)
You know, is an alien?

02:45.799 --> 02:48.967
Nope. DNA analysis confirms
she's human.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.936
So how does she
have this power?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.404
Do you believe in miracles?

02:55.976 --> 02:58.477
So none of you know
what's wrong with me?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.780
Thanks for nothing.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.287
That was such a waste of time.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.055
At least you're not an alien.
(Chuckles)

03:10.057 --> 03:11.557
Not that aliens are bad.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.358
I mean, I know quite
a few aliens and I like them.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.993
You said these people
could help me.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.930
And speaking of aliens, since
when do you know Supergirl?

03:19.967 --> 03:21.266
I, I would have told you.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.801
When?

03:22.803 --> 03:25.470
I don't know.
Maybe if we'd ever gone
on an actual date.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.805
(Scoffs)

03:26.807 --> 03:30.309
-I'm scared, winn.
-I know, I know. I'm sorry.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.879
We're gonna figure this out.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.148
Together. All right?

03:36.150 --> 03:39.051
No one here is
abandoning you, Siobhan,

03:39.053 --> 03:40.485
including me.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.058
(Sharp ringing in head)

03:46.060 --> 03:47.426
Winn: Whoa, easy. Hey...

03:47.428 --> 03:50.229
-(Gasping)
-(Ringing continues)

03:50.231 --> 03:51.897
Winn: Are you all right?

03:51.899 --> 03:53.498
I need to go.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.900
Okay, let's get you back
to Dr. Hamilton.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.401
I said I need to go.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.944
Lucy: Five people were rushed
to the hospital last night.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.281
All suffering from electrical
imbalances in the brain.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.483
Is there anything
you wanna tell me?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.452
Yeah.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.220
The food here sucks.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.688
You're the only person we know

04:16.690 --> 04:19.224
with the ability to cause
electrical phenomena

04:19.226 --> 04:20.959
of this magnitude.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.728
How did you do it?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.596
I'm flattered you think
I'm behind it,

04:24.598 --> 04:27.165
but I've got bigger
brains to fry.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.068
Like cat Grant's

04:30.070 --> 04:32.504
and Supergirl's.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.741
And when I get out of here,

04:37.511 --> 04:39.244
you're all gonna pay.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.613
(Electricity crackles)

04:55.396 --> 04:56.928
Aren't they exquisite?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.830
Yes, they look very yummy.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.869
I can see it in your eyes,
ker-rah, that you want one.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.203
But you're too scared.

05:05.205 --> 05:08.307
So instead, you gaze longingly
from a safe distance,

05:08.309 --> 05:10.976
wishing that you had one
all of your own.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.079
Well, let me tell you,

05:14.081 --> 05:15.480
cupcakes like these,

05:15.482 --> 05:16.948
they don't last.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.051
They get snatched up
and devoured.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.620
And if you don't
act fast, so will he.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.921
Ms. Grant... (Chuckles)

05:22.923 --> 05:24.790
Ker-rah, if you haven't
caught on by now,

05:24.792 --> 05:27.693
I'm trying to make a parallel
between this box of cupcakes

05:27.695 --> 05:29.227
and your nonexistent
love life.

05:29.229 --> 05:33.065
I'm not that comfortable
talking about this with you.

05:33.967 --> 05:34.966
Ugh.

05:34.968 --> 05:38.370
But if I did, what am i
supposed to do?

05:38.372 --> 05:40.272
James said he needs
time to think.

05:40.274 --> 05:42.974
But, what is that?
Time for him to

05:42.976 --> 05:44.176
talk himself out of it?

05:44.178 --> 05:45.644
If you want James,

05:45.646 --> 05:47.079
you are going to have
to make a power move.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.948
Make yourself unavailable.
Make him jealous.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.149
If you must,

05:51.151 --> 05:55.087
read my 1998 guide to
finding love entitled

05:55.089 --> 05:56.822
<i> the lighthouse technique.</i>

05:56.824 --> 05:58.924
Shine your light,
and let him come to you.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.093
And before you know it,
he'll be docked in your port.

06:01.095 --> 06:04.763
It's not my best work,
but it did get me
a spot on <i> Oprah.</i>

06:04.765 --> 06:08.433
So the best way to go
after James is

06:08.435 --> 06:09.868
not go after him at all?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.571
Mmm. Precisely.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.740
Try less. Shine more.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.142
Hmm.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.179
These are mine.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.447
Mmm-hmm.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.120
(Sniffs)

06:30.324 --> 06:32.524
(Sharp ringing in head)

06:39.400 --> 06:40.832
-(Ringing intensifies)
-(Whimpers)

06:40.834 --> 06:43.335
(Indistinct voice sounding)

06:43.337 --> 06:45.003
(Winces)

06:46.206 --> 06:48.540
What is happening to me?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.211
Ugh!

06:53.213 --> 06:54.846
(Distorted voice sounding)

07:12.232 --> 07:13.298
Hey. Um...

07:13.300 --> 07:15.000
What are you doing here?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.169
Uh, gentle reminder,
you were banned
from the building.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.171
(Distorted) If cat sees you
she's gonna call security.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.906
Or worse, she's gonna get
a restraining order.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.874
That's like her
favorite thing to get people.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.046
Cat: Ker-rah, call security.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.948
I haven't seen eyes
that crazy since

07:29.950 --> 07:32.517
I had fondue with
Ramona singer.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.454
Siobhan, I'm sorry,
you can't be here.

07:36.924 --> 07:41.793
You ruined my life,
Kara danvers.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.566
(High-pitched screeching)

07:49.870 --> 07:51.436
(Glass shatters)

07:51.438 --> 07:52.704
Kara!

08:06.954 --> 08:08.086
You're on fire!

08:09.389 --> 08:10.789
I... nope. I'm...

08:11.658 --> 08:12.991
You don't seem that bothered

08:12.993 --> 08:14.593
by the fact that
you're on fire.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.495
I didn't need you to save me.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.963
(Chuckles)

08:17.965 --> 08:19.764
You just fell from
a skyscraper.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.534
So if I hadn't been there,
you would have gone splat.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.836
I have to get
back to the city.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.904
Okay...

08:28.509 --> 08:29.774
What the what...

08:31.078 --> 08:32.544
That's a new one.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.246
I thought I was
the impossible.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.260
How did you do that?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.694
I'm Supergirl.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.330
You're who now?

08:52.332 --> 08:55.600
Sorry, I was just a little...

08:55.602 --> 08:57.802
...disoriented from
the scream.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.170
How did you save me?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.706
Well, I...

09:01.708 --> 09:05.143
You fell out a window
and I caught you

09:05.145 --> 09:08.179
and ran you all the
way out here.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.314
Which I did not mean to do

09:09.316 --> 09:11.750
but I've been
working on my speed and...

09:11.752 --> 09:13.752
Guess I'm faster
than I thought.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.255
Yes, but I...
(Exhales)

09:17.257 --> 09:18.723
Who are you?

09:20.761 --> 09:21.927
I'm the flash.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.995
-The who now?
-The...

09:23.997 --> 09:25.697
Wait, do you not
know who I am?

09:25.699 --> 09:26.865
Should I?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.333
What about the green Arrow?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.169
Black canary?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.305
Firestorm?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.574
Atom? Zoom?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.309
Sorry.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.544
Oh, boy.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.780
Not as sorry as I am.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.820
Hey, I'm Barry Allen

09:48.822 --> 09:50.755
I'm the fastest man alive.

09:50.757 --> 09:54.392
Also think I am on
the wrong earth.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.961
I'm gonna need your help.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.672
So what do you mean,
you're from another earth?

10:07.674 --> 10:10.976
What, how many other earths
are there other than this one?

10:10.978 --> 10:13.278
-(Keyboard clacking)
-You know, we're earth.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.780
I don't understand. What...

10:15.782 --> 10:17.015
You guys have central city

10:17.017 --> 10:18.650
but you don't have
s.T.A.R. Labs.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.519
No cisco Ramon,
no Harrison Wells,
no Caitlin snow.

10:21.521 --> 10:25.590
Nobody who's gonna be able
to help me get back home.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.361
Hey! Are you all right?

10:29.363 --> 10:31.129
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
What happened to Siobhan?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.498
Oh, well, after she went
all Mariah Carey on you,

10:33.500 --> 10:34.532
she just split.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.101
Oh, so we both have
Mariah Carey.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.535
That's something.

10:37.537 --> 10:40.171
-Who's are you?
-Hey, sorry, I'm Barry Allen.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.607
-James Olsen.
-And this is winn.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.175
Uh, you guys... (Chuckles)

10:44.177 --> 10:47.412
I'm not quite sure
how to tell you this.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.414
Well, I do know how
to tell you,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.448
I just...

10:50.450 --> 10:52.717
-(Clears throat) Kara?
-Yeah, right, sorry.

10:52.719 --> 10:55.353
Uh, Barry...

10:55.355 --> 10:57.255
...is from another universe.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.258
Cool!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.193
(Laughs) Whoa! Whoa!

11:02.195 --> 11:04.362
So the, the theory of the
multiverse, that's true?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.997
True. Oh, yeah. Big time.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.265
Kara: Yeah, I still
can't believe it.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.768
-And I'm from another planet.
-What?

11:09.770 --> 11:11.403
Oh, yeah. She's an alien.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.406
-You're an alien?
-Yeah.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.142
So, do you have, like,
other aliens on this earth?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.777
What do you mean
by "this earth"?

11:18.779 --> 11:21.546
Uh... ah, hold on.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.650
All right, so,
imagine there are

11:25.652 --> 11:27.986
multiple versions of earth.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.690
Um, one where the
Nazis won world war ii.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.324
One where Kennedy was
never assassinated.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.894
Oh, yeah. One where
all of us are evil.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.462
Been there. It sucks.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.765
So all of these earths occupy
the same place in space,

11:40.767 --> 11:43.401
but they vibrate at
a different frequency

11:43.403 --> 11:44.836
so they can't see one another.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.639
Yeah, but it's like if you
can go fast enough,

11:47.641 --> 11:50.675
then it's possible to open,
like, a breach,

11:50.677 --> 11:52.410
-and then travel
between worlds.
-Yeah.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.679
But how could you
travel that fast?

11:54.681 --> 11:57.482
Uh, well, um...

12:00.620 --> 12:01.720
Yes!

12:01.722 --> 12:03.354
Yeah, so, um,

12:03.356 --> 12:04.656
I was struck by lightning
the same night

12:04.658 --> 12:06.691
a particle
accelerator exploded.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.593
And I became a superhero.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.661
(Chuckles)

12:10.764 --> 12:13.364
(Stammering)
So you're a superhero, too?

12:13.366 --> 12:15.633
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's cool, I guess.

12:20.006 --> 12:21.673
Okay. So you can just like,

12:21.675 --> 12:23.641
just bop back and
forth between universes?

12:23.643 --> 12:26.211
Uh, no actually.
This happened by accident.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.912
I have traveled through time
before by accident.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.949
-That's cool.
-I've never jumped
parallel dimensions

12:30.951 --> 12:32.517
without meaning to.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.120
So until I can
figure this out,
I'm stuck here.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.056
Well, don't worry.
Don't worry at all because

12:38.058 --> 12:39.958
we're gonna help you.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.926
-I'm sorry.
-Um, it's okay.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.262
First things first, food.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.265
I have to consume about
10,000 calories a day.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.501
Oh, yeah. You've definitely
met the right girl.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.003
Do you like donuts?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.538
Who doesn't like donuts?

12:53.540 --> 12:56.174
-I know a place.
-All right.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.276
Yeah. See you.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.617
-Hmm.
-What's funny?

13:06.419 --> 13:07.952
Oh, I don't know. Just, uh,

13:07.954 --> 13:09.854
seeing the way you look at
Kara when she talks to her

13:09.856 --> 13:13.391
cool, new time-traveling,
superhuman friend.

13:13.393 --> 13:17.061
I didn't know your
face muscles could
make that look.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.397
Oh, there's, there's no look.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.433
Jealousy, thy name is Olsen.

13:25.739 --> 13:28.106
Just one more thing
I've got to get and then
we can...

13:28.108 --> 13:30.608
Ker-rah, you're alive.

13:30.610 --> 13:34.045
Ms. Grant, don't worry,
i was rescued...

13:34.047 --> 13:35.446
Stop stating the obvious.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.581
You're in the middle
of breaking news

13:36.583 --> 13:38.483
and I want you to act like it.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.617
And yes,

13:39.619 --> 13:41.820
yes, another one of
my ex-employees

13:41.822 --> 13:43.621
went all revengey. But...

13:47.160 --> 13:49.060
There's a new superhero
in national city.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.397
This is huge.
Direct competition
for Supergirl.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.466
He doesn't have
to be competition.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.837
Would you prefer a sidekick?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.605
No, not a sidekick.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.908
More like an equal.
Or an ally.
Even a partner, maybe.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.780
Speaking was the wrong choice.
I see that now.

14:08.782 --> 14:11.883
All four of you standing
there doing nothing,

14:11.885 --> 14:14.419
you look like the attractive
yet non-threatening,

14:14.421 --> 14:17.755
racially diverse cast
of a cw show.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.091
-Who are you?
-Um, he's my cousin.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.260
-My cousin.
-My cousin.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.494
No. My name's Barry Allen.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.064
I'm not actually
anybody's cousin.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.532
Uh, we're just
such good friends.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.101
Yeah. It feels like we're
family sometimes.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.402
Uh-huh.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.240
(Laughs nervously)

14:35.242 --> 14:39.310
Well, I need a clear picture
of this speedster.
James, that's on you.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.912
And ker-rah,

14:40.914 --> 14:42.981
there are a lot of people who
wanna know what happened.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.983
Speak to no one. You're mine.
I will let you know

14:44.985 --> 14:47.652
when you should reveal
this exclusive information.

14:47.654 --> 14:51.623
Now, I have to name this hero.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.491
I was thinking about
"the whoosh"

14:53.493 --> 14:55.093
or "the red streak"

14:55.095 --> 14:58.429
or "the blur."

14:59.799 --> 15:00.999
What about the flash?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.500
I'm just saying,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.269
I think that's a pretty cool
superhero name. Right?

15:04.271 --> 15:05.637
The flash?

15:05.639 --> 15:07.772
Sounds like someone
whose only superpower is

15:07.774 --> 15:09.874
jumping out of
an alley in a trench coat.

15:09.876 --> 15:13.845
No, I want mystery,
i want intrigue,

15:13.847 --> 15:15.380
I want the blur.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.950
Boys, be gone. Girl, stay.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.791
It's very clear that James

15:26.793 --> 15:29.227
is not happy seeing you
with another man.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.964
(Laughing)
I'm not with another...

15:33.500 --> 15:34.799
Really?

15:34.801 --> 15:36.801
Lighthouse. Keep it up.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.841
Thank you, my dear.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.577
Love will soon
be coming your way.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.213
Don't forget to write his name
five times

15:49.215 --> 15:50.915
in your journal every night.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.857
What the hell was that accent?

15:59.859 --> 16:01.859
It's one of the many talents
i use to trick Muggles

16:01.861 --> 16:04.829
to buy 300 bucks' worth
of cheap quartz.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.633
How is my least hated niece?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.639
I need your help.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.579
You hear her calling you.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.816
-Whispering?
-(Gasps) Yes.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.085
Yes, what is that?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.519
The banshee.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.790
Have you seriously
never considered

16:32.792 --> 16:35.960
why all the women in
our family are...

16:35.962 --> 16:38.429
Shall we say, unlikable?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.500
We're cursed, Siobhan.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.403
From way back in the day,
before we left Ireland.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.639
Some starving bog
lady ancestor

16:48.641 --> 16:50.408
stole from a banshee.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.043
So, that's it?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.778
I'm just,
I'm cursed and it's never
gonna go away?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.047
The curse is triggered when
someone wrongs you.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.150
If you want it to stop,

16:59.152 --> 17:00.618
you're going to have to kill

17:00.620 --> 17:02.920
whoever is the
object of your anger.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.190
Did you have to do that?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.693
What do you think happened to
your uncle William?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.530
And if I don't?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.933
The power inside
you will grow.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.669
Your voice becomes a weapon
that you can send

17:18.671 --> 17:21.272
anywhere in the world.

17:21.274 --> 17:24.375
Focus on your target enough

17:24.377 --> 17:28.012
and your scream will
decimate them.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.683
But you will also
destroy your soul.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.890
I would love to kill
that little blonde twig

17:38.892 --> 17:40.558
who ruined my life.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.660
I tried.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.996
But Supergirl showed up
and saved her.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.697
How am I gonna kill Kara

17:46.699 --> 17:49.100
if she's got a superhero
protecting her?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.173
What is it?

17:55.175 --> 17:59.977
The enemy of my enemy

17:59.979 --> 18:01.712
is my new partner.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.661
(High-pitched screeching)

18:31.077 --> 18:32.143
(Gasps)

18:39.686 --> 18:41.552
Stay where you are!

18:42.355 --> 18:44.155
(Electricity crackles)

18:49.229 --> 18:50.695
Lucy?

18:51.097 --> 18:52.163
I...

18:54.067 --> 18:55.199
Okay.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.936
Ms. Grant,
you have to leave now.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.506
Ker-rah, I thought I told
you to tell Bernie Sanders

19:01.508 --> 19:03.574
that I am not
interested in hot yoga.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.843
No, no. Livewire has escaped.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.078
She could be anywhere now,

19:07.080 --> 19:09.213
but you know where
she'll come eventually.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.848
So head home and pack.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.651
I will arrange a car to take
you and Carter to the airport

19:13.653 --> 19:15.453
and a plane, and guards.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.989
I will take care of all
the escape arrangements.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.659
I'm not going anywhere.
I beat her once,
I'll beat her again.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.929
Fine. I had help.
I'll have help again.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.565
National city may have lost
faith in Supergirl,

19:27.567 --> 19:28.833
but I haven't.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.169
And you shouldn't either.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.938
Ms. Grant, please...

19:33.940 --> 19:35.540
Staying put.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.580
I need your help.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.515
-Anything you need.
-Yeah, of course.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.518
I was actually
talking to Barry.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.620
Yeah. Yeah, what can I do?

19:49.622 --> 19:52.957
-Well, I have this villain.
Her name is livewire.
-Uh-huh.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.894
And she's basically like
living electricity.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.429
Cool. We have
a rogue like that.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.798
We call him blackout.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.433
Doesn't feel relevant,
all of a sudden.

20:02.435 --> 20:07.638
Right. So she just broke
out of this prison and...

20:10.076 --> 20:12.843
And all she wants out of life
is to kill Ms. Grant.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.278
And with Siobhan
still out there,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.714
I don't think that
i can protect her by myself.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.249
Okay.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.352
National city needs the flash.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.121
-Oh, Kara, I...
-And once they're both
back in custody,

20:24.123 --> 20:27.191
I promise that we will do
everything in our power

20:27.193 --> 20:28.326
to get you back home.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.061
What do you say?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.029
Partners?

20:32.632 --> 20:34.198
Partners.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.266
(Chuckles)

20:42.108 --> 20:44.609
-Yo, this place is amazing,
all right?
-(Supergirl and winn laughing)

20:44.611 --> 20:46.944
-Is this a spaceship?
-That's actually my spaceship.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.412
I love this earth.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.880
Hey, winn, can I get a
picture with this bad boy?

20:49.882 --> 20:51.082
-Winn: Oh, yeah. Sure.
-Awesome.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.383
Supergirl: Winn. Winn...

20:52.385 --> 20:54.285
That's probably
not a good idea, dude.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.754
-All right.
-Lucy: Agreed.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.556
Who is this masked man? Alien?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.825
Metahuman.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.361
Well, we have protocol for
visitors at the deo,
Supergirl.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.395
Guys, it's fine.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.831
He's here to help us
find livewire.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.266
We do need all the
help we can get.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.601
So what do I call you?
Speedy?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.472
-Barry Allen.
-Lucy Lane.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.908
I hope you're bringing
more to the table than
just quick reflexes.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.377
As it just so happens,

21:19.379 --> 21:21.646
catching criminals is both
my night and day job.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.947
I'm a CSI.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.348
By the way, do you guys
have a crime lab here?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.117
Yeah. My sister's lab's
right over there.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.885
Wait, you have a sister?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.453
Where is she at?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.521
I wish I knew.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.927
(Electricity crackles)

21:51.544 --> 21:54.011
They even have my brand.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.350
Siobhan: I wanted to make
you feel at home.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.221
Who the hell are you?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.958
Siobhan Smythe.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.528
It's like your parents knew
you'd grow up to
be a big snob.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.697
I need your help.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.365
I can help you catch on fire.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.500
You should be a
little more grateful

22:16.502 --> 22:18.703
since I'm the one who broke
you out of your hamster wheel.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.338
How'd you do that?

22:22.008 --> 22:23.674
-(High-pitched screeching)
-(Groans)

22:31.451 --> 22:32.550
Luck of the Irish.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.220
Okay, I'm listening.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.023
Sort of.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.324
It's why I drew you here.

22:40.326 --> 22:43.127
You and I have
shared interests.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.262
You wanna kill cat Grant
and Supergirl,

22:45.264 --> 22:47.198
and I wanna kill
cat's assistant

22:47.200 --> 22:49.266
who's protected by them both.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.968
Figured we could team up.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.237
Like an evil
Taylor swift squad?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.140
What do you say?

22:56.876 --> 22:58.175
Not in that outfit.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.877
You need a makeover.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.412
This is gonna be fun.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.620
(Both laughing)

23:11.157 --> 23:13.190
I know that look.

23:14.961 --> 23:18.028
I used to look at you with her
and have that very same sneer.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.164
-(Chuckles)
-But much cuter.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.834
That? No, no, no.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.303
I was... (Clears throat)
I was thinking.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.505
And a sneer? Come on.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.373
Pfft. No. I was...
(Stammers)

23:29.375 --> 23:30.441
Allergies.

23:34.147 --> 23:38.582
Okay. I just came by to see
if I could help.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.551
But it looks like they
got it covered, so...

23:40.553 --> 23:44.188
Piece of advice. If you're
holding back with her

23:44.190 --> 23:46.056
because of me, don't.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.460
You had it right when
you left Metropolis.

23:49.462 --> 23:53.197
It wasn't superman,
it was us just not fitting.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.332
And I realize now

23:55.334 --> 23:58.335
that I tried to force things
by moving here.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.440
And the truth is, we were
never gonna work, were we?

24:03.309 --> 24:04.642
Supergirl: We found livewire.

24:05.711 --> 24:06.977
That's great news.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.713
-Actually, it was Barry.
-Of course it was.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.749
Livewire's ability to absorb
the electrical energy

24:11.751 --> 24:13.250
in the air surrounding her
gave me an idea.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.453
So I wrote an algorithm
to monitor variations

24:15.455 --> 24:16.720
in meter usage
around the city,

24:16.722 --> 24:18.355
and it all leads to
that warehouse.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.090
I see bad guys love their
abandoned warehouses

24:20.092 --> 24:21.325
on your earth, too, huh?

24:21.327 --> 24:22.693
I'll authorize a drop team.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.496
No. No, no.
She's too dangerous. Let's go.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.798
All right, yeah.
What's the plan?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.233
Catch the bad girl,

24:29.235 --> 24:31.168
bring her back here so she
can't hurt anyone.

24:31.170 --> 24:32.837
85% chance of punching.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.104
Okay. That I get.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.973
But like, what's the plan?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.275
Maybe we can overload
her somehow.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.444
Yeah, what about the
industrial capacitator

24:40.446 --> 24:41.846
you were gonna
trap her in last time?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.581
No, no. It went busto.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.449
Well, dynamic duo will build
you a new one.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.218
No. If we wait, we lose her.

24:47.220 --> 24:50.754
If we lose her,
god knows what kind of
damage she could do,

24:50.756 --> 24:52.189
or who she could hurt.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.859
I defeated her once before.
I can do it again.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.393
With your help.

24:56.395 --> 24:57.661
I'm right behind you.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.465
Have I told you how much
i like that guy?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.568
(Whooshing)

25:13.679 --> 25:16.146
For the record,
i got here first.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.982
Yeah, for the record,
i went around the block

25:17.984 --> 25:19.717
to check the perimeter.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.151
-So, technically, I let you
get here first.
-(Chuckles)

25:22.121 --> 25:23.621
You sure this is
the right place?

25:23.623 --> 25:25.155
Hope so.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.958
(Electricity crackling)

25:27.960 --> 25:29.793
Long time, cape and skirt.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.228
Didn't think you could
fight me solo,

25:31.230 --> 25:32.496
so you brought a date?

25:33.099 --> 25:34.665
How sweet.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.233
I got this.

25:48.748 --> 25:49.747
Uh-oh.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.782
(Laughing)
Thanks for the charge.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.254
Flash!

25:58.391 --> 25:59.790
(Groans)

26:03.529 --> 26:05.796
(High-pitched screeching)

26:07.967 --> 26:09.466
I brought a friend, too.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.206
Meet silver banshee.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.851
All my life I thought
i was cursed.

26:27.853 --> 26:31.288
But now I see I was cursed
for the better.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.194
You don't have to do this.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.763
I wanna help you.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.299
Funny. She said the same
thing to me once.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.336
Here's what I say to that.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.371
(High-pitched screeching)

26:47.373 --> 26:48.639
Aah! (Grunts)

26:52.278 --> 26:54.445
Once you two are dead,

26:54.447 --> 26:57.314
I can finally give that little
blonde moppet,

26:57.316 --> 27:00.417
Kara danvers, the death
she deserves.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.853
Maybe Kara danvers is tougher
than you think.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.622
(Blows air)

27:09.395 --> 27:11.328
We're not gonna
win this today!

27:27.780 --> 27:29.713
Hey.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.416
How are you doing?

27:32.418 --> 27:33.684
Well, aside from my eardrums

27:33.686 --> 27:35.986
ringing like church bells,
I'm okay.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.623
You sure?

27:39.625 --> 27:41.191
You don't seem okay.

27:44.964 --> 27:49.099
I'm sorry I made you rush in
on livewire without a plan.

27:49.101 --> 27:52.236
I didn't know she was
gonna have a cohort.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.571
That's the thing about
being a superhero.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.206
You have to somehow

27:56.208 --> 27:58.242
be prepared
for the unexpected.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.746
Something happened to me
a few weeks ago.

28:03.983 --> 28:07.017
I was exposed to
this substance

28:07.019 --> 28:08.919
that made me crazy.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.456
I did a lot of
horrible things.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.526
That's rough.

28:15.528 --> 28:19.697
And when I was helping people
as Supergirl, I was...

28:19.699 --> 28:22.232
I was so happy.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.568
And now that the people
don't want me to help them,

28:24.570 --> 28:27.271
I feel lost.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.506
And I'm in such a
hurry to prove myself again,

28:29.508 --> 28:32.176
I'm making stupid mistakes.
Like today.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.014
This is gonna sound
ironic coming from me

28:37.016 --> 28:40.551
but, um, you need
to slow down.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.988
Just keep doing
your good work.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.057
Don't worry about the rest.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.927
The public
will forgive you, I promise.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.228
How can you be so sure?

28:51.230 --> 28:53.831
'Cause the same thing
happened to me.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.999
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:56.001 --> 28:58.135
So what finally fixed things?

28:59.205 --> 29:02.439
-Time.
-(Sighs)

29:02.441 --> 29:05.843
When you're used to
fixing things with

29:05.845 --> 29:08.912
brute strength,
or in my case, amazing speed,

29:08.914 --> 29:13.016
it's hard to accept that there
are things out of our control.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.487
-It's humbling. Right?
-Yep.

29:16.489 --> 29:20.891
And believe me, when you stop
trying to force the solution,

29:20.893 --> 29:22.760
it'll happen on its own.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.498
I'm really sorry you're locked
out of your world.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.834
But I'm really
glad you're here.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.104
Me too.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.350
Hey, um, where's Kara?

29:46.352 --> 29:48.051
She's with Barry
back at the deo.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.119
Barry had some ideas about...

29:49.121 --> 29:50.721
It's okay. I'm good.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.222
If they're taking care of it,
that's all I need to know.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.724
-Okay.
-Thanks.

29:55.795 --> 29:56.827
I need to call you back.

29:56.829 --> 29:57.895
Where is ker-rah?

29:59.198 --> 30:00.864
Oh, well, when she gets back,

30:00.866 --> 30:02.599
tell her I want her
to book me a massage

30:02.601 --> 30:04.735
with the same physio who did
wonders for Beyonce

30:04.737 --> 30:06.603
after her super bowl
performance.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.239
Why are you looking
at me like that, winn?

30:09.241 --> 30:13.610
I am fine and i
remain unafraid.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.612
I, I didn't question that,
Ms. Grant.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.947
Good.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.916
(Television screens distort)

30:18.918 --> 30:20.284
<i> Livewire.</i>

30:20.286 --> 30:22.619
Not, not good.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.288
You really should watch
where you're going, cat.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.023
Or someone's
gonna need to declaw you.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.358
You know, you really need to
get some new material, Leslie.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.662
Okay. Well, your days
of telling me or
my friend what to do

30:31.664 --> 30:33.397
-are long over.
-(Elevator dings)

30:33.399 --> 30:35.599
Cat: Oh, it's you, Siobhan.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.802
I see that my ex-minions
have united.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.270
Strength in numbers?

30:40.272 --> 30:43.907
You should call Norma rae and
find out how it's really done.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.781
(Gasping)

30:52.785 --> 30:56.286
You know, your voice is just
about as grating as this.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.288
Siobhan. Siobhan!

30:58.290 --> 30:59.957
Don't... don't do this.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.692
Don't make me hurt you, winn.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.862
Hey, hey.
I can help you.
We can find a way to fix this.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.697
I don't need help.

31:06.699 --> 31:07.998
This is who I am.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.533
No. It's not!

31:09.535 --> 31:12.302
You cannot keep hurting
people, Siobhan. It's wrong.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.304
Oh, but it feels so right.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.740
Just listen to me. Okay?
You're... (Stammering)

31:16.742 --> 31:19.009
You are confused.

31:19.011 --> 31:22.946
I know how upset you were when
you found out that stuff
about your dad.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.114
Believe me, I know.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.216
Look at me, Siobhan. You...

31:27.453 --> 31:31.421
You wanted him to be
a better person. Yeah?

31:31.423 --> 31:33.757
(Softly) You wanted that for
yourself, too.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.426
Okay? You do not...
You do not have to
cross this line.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.463
Siobhan, please, just let me
try and help you.

31:43.769 --> 31:45.469
I'm good as is.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.571
(High-pitched screeching)

31:52.111 --> 31:54.611
So back on my earth,
we fought a villain
who used sound waves

31:54.613 --> 31:56.313
as a weapon.
He called himself pied Piper.

31:56.315 --> 31:57.714
-That's a cool name.
-Yeah.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.583
So I whipped up
these bad boys.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.018
Sorry I keep saying
"bad boys."

32:01.020 --> 32:02.552
-Are they earbuds?
-Yeah.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.888
It'll protect us from
silver banshee's yelly voice.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.758
James just called.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.327
Livewire and silver banshee
kidnapped cat.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.195
<i> Hello, red and blue.</i>

32:12.197 --> 32:13.864
<i> Come to national city park now</i>

32:13.866 --> 32:16.199
<i> if you don't want cat's</i>
<i> blood all over your hands</i>

32:16.201 --> 32:18.936
<i> or all over the street.</i>

32:18.938 --> 32:20.370
(Laughs maniacally)

32:20.372 --> 32:21.939
You don't have to
do this, Barry.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.507
This is my fight.

32:23.509 --> 32:24.975
One for all and all for...

32:24.977 --> 32:27.277
You guys have
<i> three musketeers</i> here, right?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.545
All for one.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.621
(People screaming)

32:46.098 --> 32:47.998
Think they'll show?

32:48.567 --> 32:50.534
Don't know.

32:50.536 --> 32:51.802
Don't really care.

32:53.038 --> 32:55.172
Either way,
I'm getting my jolts.

32:56.542 --> 32:59.209
You see, cat, I'm still 50-50

32:59.211 --> 33:02.846
if your heart's
actually beating,

33:02.848 --> 33:04.247
but I'm gonna stop it anyway.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.216
No, Leslie.
Please don't do this.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.086
Begging?

33:09.088 --> 33:10.253
I'm disappointed.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.291
What are you so afraid
you're gonna miss, hmm?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.126
Another silly award ceremony?

33:16.128 --> 33:18.729
Where a bunch of sycophants
kowtow to the false queen

33:18.731 --> 33:20.197
and tell you how great
you are?

33:20.199 --> 33:21.765
No.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.300
No. I'm not asking for myself.

33:23.302 --> 33:24.935
I'm asking for my boys.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.838
I'm all they have.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.378
Please don't take their mother
away from my them.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.645
Hey, sparky!

33:36.648 --> 33:37.914
Shrieky,

33:42.755 --> 33:43.804
hi.

33:43.805 --> 33:44.854
What do you say we step away
from the nice lady?

33:44.857 --> 33:46.156
Settle this like women.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.061
What? There's more of you
guys here than me.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.964
Kill 'em both.

33:54.967 --> 33:57.034
(High-pitched screeching)

34:05.244 --> 34:06.543
Told you it'd work.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.378
What? You lose your voice?

34:09.581 --> 34:10.647
What are you waiting for?

34:10.649 --> 34:11.948
Watch who you yell at!

34:15.154 --> 34:16.253
(Grunts)

34:24.563 --> 34:27.064
-What took you so long?
-Are you kidding?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.043
(Electricity crackles)

34:42.648 --> 34:43.914
Zap.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.854
-(Grunts)
-(Screeches)

34:53.959 --> 34:54.991
(Helicopter whirring)

34:58.430 --> 35:00.297
I hate helicopters.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.351
(Crowd murmuring)

35:22.187 --> 35:23.053
Man: She's hurt.

35:23.055 --> 35:24.321
Woman: She saved
that helicopter.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.190
-She saved us!
-She saved all of us!

35:30.829 --> 35:32.095
(Supergirl groaning)

35:34.766 --> 35:36.466
Leave her alone!

35:36.468 --> 35:39.035
Yesterday you people were
ready to string her up.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.738
Now you're willing
to die for her?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.840
She was willing to die for us.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.277
Livewire: What do you say
we thin the herd?

35:47.279 --> 35:49.412
(Crackling)

35:56.788 --> 35:58.822
No, don't. Please, please.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.757
-(Water splashing)
-(Livewire screaming)

36:00.759 --> 36:03.260
(Crackling intensifies)

36:06.498 --> 36:08.198
(Shrieking)

36:10.969 --> 36:12.903
(Crowd cheering
and applauding)

36:16.175 --> 36:17.908
Make sure all these
people are safe.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.781
Supergirl.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.518
It was our turn to help you.

36:39.131 --> 36:41.131
Reporter: <i> In one of the most</i>
<i> remarkable displays</i>

36:41.133 --> 36:43.133
<i> of city unity I've ever seen,</i>

36:43.135 --> 36:46.136
<i> Supergirl's willingness</i>
<i> to sacrifice her own life</i>
<i> for the innocent</i>

36:46.138 --> 36:49.439
<i> has made her the hero</i>
<i> of national city once again.</i>

36:51.109 --> 36:53.276
Hey, so what happened to
Siobhan and Leslie?

36:53.278 --> 36:55.178
Did they, uh, did they get
locked up at the deo?

36:55.180 --> 36:57.047
Nope. No.
Now, thanks to Barry,

36:57.049 --> 36:58.348
the national city
police department

36:58.350 --> 37:00.283
has a way to
lock up metahumans.

37:00.285 --> 37:01.151
Oh.

37:01.153 --> 37:04.287
And like you taught Supergirl,

37:04.289 --> 37:06.623
our enemies
deserve a fair trial.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.892
Well, I'm always
good for advice.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.997
Oh, Ms. Grant,

37:13.999 --> 37:16.800
if it's all right with you,
our cousin,

37:16.802 --> 37:18.335
Barry...

37:18.337 --> 37:19.603
(Stammering)

37:19.605 --> 37:23.540
Barry's leaving town
and I was gonna see him off.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.742
Okay. Tell Mr. Allen
to have a good time

37:25.744 --> 37:27.711
zipping around
in his red outfit.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.679
Wait, you knew
he was the flash?

37:29.681 --> 37:30.947
Oh, please.

37:30.949 --> 37:32.749
Barry shows up,
the flash shows up.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.584
His insistence on
that silly name.

37:34.586 --> 37:38.054
And he was so unfailingly
charming and nice,

37:38.056 --> 37:40.790
that he had to either
be a superhero or a mormon.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.726
Ker-rah, I can
spot the extraordinary

37:42.728 --> 37:46.563
pretending to be a nobody in
my midst just like that.
(Snaps fingers)

37:46.565 --> 37:49.366
Now, my eyebrow waxing
with Arabella

37:49.368 --> 37:52.202
at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning
is not going to book itself.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.371
Feel how good
it feels to dial.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.905
I'm on it.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.141
(Sighs)

37:58.143 --> 37:59.843
(James and winn chuckling)

37:59.845 --> 38:01.077
I'm gonna go help Barry.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.813
Oh, hey, tell him
i hope he makes it home.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.181
Yeah, me too.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.125
You really think this
is gonna work?

38:15.127 --> 38:18.161
Well, watching livewire
and banshee work together

38:18.163 --> 38:20.964
reminded me of
something that we
tried on my earth once.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.000
You and I join forces.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.102
Literally.

38:26.104 --> 38:28.571
We combine your speed
with my speed.

38:28.573 --> 38:31.541
If you throw me forward at
your fastest, then

38:33.345 --> 38:35.445
I might just break the
dimensional barrier

38:35.447 --> 38:36.980
and get back home.

38:36.982 --> 38:39.316
What? What do you mean?

38:39.318 --> 38:40.383
Like a race?

38:41.119 --> 38:42.419
Yeah, I guess.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.120
(Laughs)

38:44.122 --> 38:46.122
Think you can keep up,
girl of steel?

38:46.124 --> 38:49.059
(Chuckles) Just you watch,
Scarlet speedster.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.027
(Laughs) All right.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.231
I'm gonna miss you,
Barry Allen.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.668
I'm really gonna miss
you too, Kara danvers.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.704
Or Kara Zor-El.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.640
Which is your alien name.
Because you're an alien

39:03.642 --> 39:04.874
which I think is very cool.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.309
(Laughs)

39:08.080 --> 39:10.013
I think James Olsen
thinks so, too.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.248
What makes you say that?

39:12.250 --> 39:15.919
You remember before when i
told you to take things slow?

39:15.921 --> 39:17.787
That's good
advice for a superhero,

39:17.789 --> 39:20.690
lousy advice for two people
who really like each other.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.027
Maybe it's time to
speed things up.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.197
Maybe.

39:31.503 --> 39:33.403
Come here.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.338
All right.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.041
Let's do this.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.309
(Supergirl exhales)

39:43.382 --> 39:44.781
On your marks...

39:44.783 --> 39:46.349
Get set.

39:46.351 --> 39:47.417
Go!

40:00.766 --> 40:02.098
Goodbye, Barry.

40:09.207 --> 40:10.473
(Knocking at door)

40:15.680 --> 40:18.081
-Hey, come in.
-Hey.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.252
Um... (Clears throat)
So, did, uh,

40:22.254 --> 40:23.686
did Barry make it home?

40:23.688 --> 40:27.023
Yes, I think. I hope so.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.326
-So I think...
-So, I... (Chuckles)

40:31.430 --> 40:32.962
Um, I...

40:32.964 --> 40:36.232
You know what,
sorry, you go first.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.701
I just wanted to talk to you
about infinite earths.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.070
Infinite earths?

40:41.973 --> 40:44.140
Yeah.

40:44.142 --> 40:46.643
-Uh, Barry was...
-Barry was saying?

40:48.113 --> 40:51.114
Yeah, Barry was
explaining to us that

40:51.116 --> 40:53.416
there's an infinite
number of earths

40:53.418 --> 40:55.518
and they all vibrate at
different speeds

40:55.520 --> 40:57.253
so they can occupy
the same place,

40:57.255 --> 41:00.590
but never actually come into
contact with each other.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.525
The point is,

41:02.527 --> 41:05.361
if two of these
infinite earths

41:05.363 --> 41:07.630
can manage to find a way

41:07.632 --> 41:12.836
to vibrate at the
exact same speed, maybe...

41:15.607 --> 41:17.507
Maybe there's a chance
they could be together.

41:20.111 --> 41:23.913
Kara... what are you
trying to say?

41:23.915 --> 41:26.249
No more saying.
I'm so much better at doing.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.804
Was that good?

41:52.577 --> 41:53.843
Was it not good?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.747
(Laughs nervously)

41:58.717 --> 42:01.451
Too good? (Laughing)
I don't...

42:02.854 --> 42:04.120
James?

42:07.092 --> 42:08.491
James, are you okay?

42:16.968 --> 42:18.234
James!

42:32.017 --> 42:35.552
General, myriad has been
activated.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.989
For you, astra.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.359
First national city,

42:43.361 --> 42:46.429
and then the earth
itself will belong to us.
