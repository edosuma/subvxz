00:13.555 --> 00:16.141
<i>This story</i>
<i>is about to take a dark turn.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:21.104
<i>Usually, I love dark turns.</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:25.150
<i>Like when the carousel brakes</i>
<i>mysteriously failed</i>

00:25.233 --> 00:26.776
<i>at my eighth birthday party.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:29.738
<i>But not this one.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:38.496
We've been searching
for hours, Sheriff.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.956
The dogs need a break.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.666
Think we missed something?

00:41.750 --> 00:45.587
I say we double back, sweep Collet Creek,
and then call it a night.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.546
Okay.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.263
-How could you miss a dead body?
-'Cause it wasn't there.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.767
No footprints, no blood,
no sign of a struggle. Nothing, nada.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.560
My search party looked all night.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.605
Well, your search party must have
left their seeing-eye dogs at home.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.732
I saw that monster
kill Rowan right in front of me.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.194
-Get a good look at this monster thing?
-It didn't stick around for a chat.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.947
-Maybe it was one of your classmates.
-Sheriff, I find that question offensive.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.658
I don't care, 'cause I got
three other dead bodies in the morgue.

01:15.742 --> 01:19.329
-Hikers just ripped apart in the woods.
-The mayor said those were bear attacks.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.581
Well, the mayor and I disagree on that.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.834
So you automatically assume
a Nevermore student is the murderer,

01:24.918 --> 01:27.837
even though there's no evidence
a crime was even committed.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.175
I'm sorry. I forgot, you only teach
the good outcasts here, right?

01:37.764 --> 01:39.974
My guess is Rowan ran away.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.770
State troopers have put out an alert,
and I've contacted his family,

01:43.853 --> 01:45.480
but they haven't heard from him either.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.858
Dead people are notoriously bad
at returning calls.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.528
What were you doing out in the woods
with him, Ms. Addams?

01:51.611 --> 01:54.030
I heard a noise in the forest
and went to go investigate.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.074
That's when I stumbled upon the attack.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.284
Then what happened?

01:58.368 --> 02:01.496
Then I ran into Bianca Barclay,
and I told her to go for help.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.499
Next thing I remember,
I was awaking in my dorm.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.961
And just to be clear, this monster
wasn't a bear or some other wild animal?

02:08.044 --> 02:10.004
I've hibernated with grizzlies.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.798
I know the difference.

02:11.881 --> 02:12.882
Thank you, Sheriff.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.926
I think Miss Addams is done now.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.637
Actually, I would like
to speak to Sheriff Galpin. Alone.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.933
I'm not sure I can allow that.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.311
I'm sure I could take her to the station
and get a formal statement.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.651
-Yeah, let's go.
-Fine.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.446
You have five minutes,
and everything is off the record.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.323
Play nice…

02:39.868 --> 02:41.494
or I will call the mayor.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.919
Someone is trying to cover up
Rowan's murder.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.297
That's the only reason
to scrub the crime scene.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.216
Is that your professional opinion
as the daughter of a murderer?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.759
My father's twice the man you are,

02:56.843 --> 02:59.721
and the only thing he murders
is the occasional opera in the shower.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.807
It's been a long night.
I'm tired of your games.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.350
I'm not playing games.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.269
I'm telling the truth.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.480
You want to reject my claims
but you can't.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
Why is that?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.444
Because you and I both know
there's a monster out there.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.907
And Rowan is his latest victim.

03:21.784 --> 03:22.952
-Sheriff?
-What?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.371
You're gonna want to see this.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.963
<i>Edgar Allan Poe said,</i>

03:34.047 --> 03:36.883
<i>"Believe nothing you hear</i>
<i>and half of what you see."</i>

03:37.800 --> 03:40.887
<i>Clearly Nevermore's most famous alumni</i>
<i>picked that up here.</i>

03:42.722 --> 03:45.266
<i>No wonder he became a drug-addled madman.</i>

03:57.528 --> 04:00.573
Help me understand
why you claim you witnessed a murder.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.116
Was it to gain attention?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.452
Why should I bother telling you anything?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.496
You've already decided I'm lying.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.707
I know what I saw.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.960
Your life's had
a lot of upheaval recently.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.295
It's okay to be confused about things.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.423
Don't try and lure me into
one of your psychological traps.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.634
No one is trying to trap you.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.469
I'm here to help you
process your emotions.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.263
Emotions are a gateway trait.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.349
They lead to feelings,
which trigger tears.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.184
I don't do tears.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.230
Tell me how you're adjusting to school.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.440
Sartre said, "Hell is other people."

04:35.233 --> 04:36.609
He was my first crush.

04:37.193 --> 04:39.654
Wednesday, Part of the reason
your parents sent you to Nevermore

04:39.737 --> 04:42.907
is so you could find your people.
Become part of a larger community.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.450
I like being an island.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.911
A well-fortified one surrounded by sharks.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.746
Have you considered
your antisocial tendencies

04:48.830 --> 04:50.373
might be motivated by fear of rejection?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.834
If you were to reject me,
I would not be upset.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.420
You can't get rid of me that easily.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.592
And look, you made it through an entire
session without trying to escape.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.094
I'll take that as a win.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.808
Guess you decided
to stick around Jericho.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.518
Wait, you see Dr. Kinbott too?

05:10.601 --> 05:12.979
You should know
I'm legally required to be here.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.274
Uh, me too. Court ordered.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.861
Look at us. A couple of teenage tearaways.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.242
Hey, when you ran off last night
at the Harvest Festival,

05:26.326 --> 05:28.578
I wasn't sure what happened,
and then I heard…

05:30.496 --> 05:31.414
Kinda crazy.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.334
Everyone, including your father,
believes I made it all up.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.835
-You know, I…

05:37.712 --> 05:39.672
Time to get in touch with my inner rebel.

05:40.381 --> 05:41.632
You know, for the record,

05:43.134 --> 05:44.052
I believe you.

05:52.935 --> 05:56.105
Ladies, come on!
Let's work on those teeth.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.024
More scowl.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.193
This kitty is taking no prisoners.

06:00.276 --> 06:04.989
If Bianca Barclay wins again this year,
I will literally scratch my own eyes out!

06:05.073 --> 06:06.282
I would pay money to see that.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.494
Howdy, roomie!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.288
I'm so glad you decided to stay.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.290
I thought you wanted
your single room back.

06:14.374 --> 06:18.127
Full disclosure, I don't like living solo
and Thing gives a killer neck massage.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.379
It's a win-win.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.715
So… why the change of heart?

06:22.799 --> 06:26.052
I refuse to play the role of a pawn
in someone else's corrupt game.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.722
-You mean Rowan?
-I witnessed his murder, Enid.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.934
It's just, we all saw him this morning.

06:33.017 --> 06:35.520
Very much, like, not dead.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.521
I know.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.357
Which leads me to believe
I've been losing my mind.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.444
It's not nearly as fun
as I had anticipated.

06:44.862 --> 06:47.865
You're Nevermore's gossip queen.
What's Rowan's story?

06:47.949 --> 06:50.076
Other than being a weird loner… Uh…

06:50.576 --> 06:51.994
-No offense.
-None taken.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.663
Xavier Thorpe's his roommate.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.749
If you had a cell phone,
you could just text him and ask him.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.585
Yoko. Come on! Flare those whiskers.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.088
The Poe Cup droops for no one.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.756
What is the Poe Cup anyway?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.633
My entire reason for living right now.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.345
Part canoe race,
part foot chase, no rules.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.433
Each dorm has to pick an Edgar Allan Poe
short story for inspiration.

07:14.183 --> 07:15.268
You could grab a brush.

07:15.351 --> 07:19.063
Ms. Thornhill's just ordered pizza.
Want to take a stab at being social?

07:20.189 --> 07:21.441
I do like stabbing.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.402
The social part, not so much.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.237
Besides, it'll cut into my writing time.

07:26.821 --> 07:27.947
No worries.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.367
Just as long as you're lakeside
cheering us to victory on race day.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.331
Or you can just glare uncomfortably.
Whatever works for you.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.462
<i>I've always hated the expression</i>
<i>"write what you know."</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.552
<i>It's a hall pass</i>
<i>for the imagination-impaired.</i>

07:52.221 --> 07:54.599
<i>But when your life</i>
<i>becomes a twisted mystery…</i>

07:57.351 --> 07:59.437
<i>maybe it's time to lean into it.</i>

08:09.739 --> 08:11.741
I need to speak with Rowan.
I can't find him.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.035
It won't be possible, I'm afraid.
He's been expelled.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.745
For what?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.498
Never you mind. He'll be on
the first train out this afternoon.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.958
What were you doing
out in the woods with him?

08:21.042 --> 08:22.460
I told you already.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.629
I heard a noise,
and I went to investigate.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.300
That excuse might have placated
the sheriff, but you can't fool me.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.803
You had a psychic vision, didn't you?

08:34.680 --> 08:37.350
I realized you might be having them
when we passed by the accident

08:37.433 --> 08:39.977
and you knew that poor farmer
had broken his neck.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.815
Your mother started having visions
around your age.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.904
They were notoriously unreliable
and dangerous.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.323
I remember at first,

08:53.491 --> 08:55.785
she thought she might be losing her mind.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.996
Have you spoken to her about them?

09:03.167 --> 09:06.087
Clearly the person
withholding information here is you.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.130
May I go now?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.967
Not until you've picked
your extracurricular activity.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.803
We want our students to be well-rounded.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.805
I'd prefer to remain sharp-edged.

09:16.389 --> 09:20.351
I took the liberty of putting together
a list of clubs that have openings.

09:20.935 --> 09:21.894
How thoughtful.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.272
You need to have picked one
by the end of the day.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.275
I'll be keeping my eye on you.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.279
No doubt you'll find something
that tickles your fancy.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.823
The last person who tickled me
lost a finger.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.871
Weems is clearly trying
to keep tabs on me.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.373
Keep an eye on Rowan.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.584
Don't let your fingers out of his sight.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.471
Weems said you'd be stopping by.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.975
But to be honest, after your performance
at the Harvest Festival,

10:01.058 --> 10:02.518
drama club might be more your speed.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.438
After I passed out, who did you tell?
The sheriff?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.190
You think I'd trust normie cops?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.067
I went straight to Weems
and let her handle it.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.195
Anyway, let's get this audition over with.

10:13.279 --> 10:17.408
What are you? Alto, soprano or just <i>loco?</i>

10:23.539 --> 10:24.373
Huh?

10:28.711 --> 10:29.545
What was that?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.714
A note only dogs can hear.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.910
Huh. You actually showed up.
Ever shot a bow and arrow before?

11:00.993 --> 11:02.536
Only on live targets.

11:04.038 --> 11:04.872
Okay.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.626
Square stance.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.461
Load the arrow like this, yellow side out.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.421
Three fingers.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.549
Pull back and…

11:17.176 --> 11:18.427
let it fly.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.096
Any questions?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.057
When's the last time
you saw your roommate Rowan?

11:23.140 --> 11:25.142
You mean the one
that was killed by a monster?

11:26.727 --> 11:28.813
The Harvest Festival.
I haven't talked to him since.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.857
But his side of the room
was all packed this morning.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.234
Rowan's always been a little off,

11:33.317 --> 11:36.278
but, uh, the last couple weeks
he's been more erratic.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.907
You know, telekinesis can mess
with your head, you know. He's…

11:39.990 --> 11:41.534
It started to freak me out.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.662
So what's the deal with you and Tyler?

11:46.580 --> 11:49.625
I'm sorry, were you the only one
who got to ask non-archery questions?

11:49.709 --> 11:53.295
There is no deal. He was doing me
a favor driving me out of town.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.548
Yeah, word of advice. Steer clear.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.924
Why? Because he's a normie?

11:57.007 --> 11:58.759
Tyler and his friends are jerks.

11:59.427 --> 12:02.471
They can't stand that this school's
propping up their Podunk town.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.974
Says the boy whose life
was served on a silver platter.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.434
Hey, girls in glass houses…

12:06.517 --> 12:07.977
Should throw bigger stones.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.106
At least I'm not an elitist snob.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.737
Ouch.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.549
Are you interested
in the ancient art of beekeeping?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.594
Eugene. Eugene Ottinger.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.013
Founder and president
of the Nevermore Hummers.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.890
Wednesday. Wednesday Addams.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.809
Am I late or is it only you?

12:50.853 --> 12:53.105
The hive life isn't for everyone.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.316
Most kids are afraid of venomous insects.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.944
Are you willing to feel the sting?

13:04.283 --> 13:08.662
Bees have been producing honey
in the same way for 150 million years.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.831
They're nature's perfect community.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.876
All working together
to achieve a common goal.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.964
Fun fact, it's also one of the few
ecosystems in which females dominate.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.885
From the queen bee to her workers.
There's no patriarchy in the hive!

13:29.725 --> 13:32.102
Rowan! We need to talk.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.606
Wednesday, I'm not allowed
to speak to anyone.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.858
You had a lot to say
when you tried to kill me.

13:38.859 --> 13:41.445
Told me I was destined
to destroy the school, remember?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.031
Where did you get that drawing?

13:44.114 --> 13:46.283
I just went into the woods
to clear my head.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
Then you came after me.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.162
Wednesday.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.873
You shouldn't be here.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.376
Yeah, back off and leave me alone.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.742
I'm going to give you
all the materials again…

15:51.825 --> 15:54.370
How do you lose him
in a bathroom with no windows?

15:55.996 --> 15:57.748
A lefty wouldn't have failed me.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.834
Don't sulk.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.837
I'm going to have to find
new evidence myself,

16:03.921 --> 16:05.673
since you lost our only lead.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.841
I see you finally made a friend.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.718
Even if it is a plant.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.553
I go for quality over quantity.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.440
There's an open spot next to me.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.486
If you can stand sitting
that close to an elitist snob.

16:47.214 --> 16:50.467
I doubt Wednesday is impressed
by your tricks, Mr. Thorpe.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.720
Admit it, you're a little impressed.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.772
Wednesday, we're thrilled
to have you join us

17:03.856 --> 17:07.192
on our journey into
the world of carnivorous plants.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.110
Now…

17:09.028 --> 17:11.447
who can tell us the name of this beauty?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.241
<i>Dendrophylax lindenii.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:18.078
Otherwise known as the ghost orchid.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.914
First discovered
on the Isle of Wight in 1854.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.043
Very good, Wednesday.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.212
You may have competition
for first chair, Bianca.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.048
-Ooh!

17:29.131 --> 17:33.510
Wednesday, perhaps you can identify
the ghost orchid's greatest qualities.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.387
Resilience and adaptability.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.141
It's able to thrive in even
the most hostile environments.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.727
But its mere presence
can change the ecosystem,

17:41.810 --> 17:43.979
causing the established plants
to reject it.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.357
Usually because the native species
is allowed to thrive unchecked.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.693
Nothing a Weedwackercouldn't fix.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.530
-You can most certainly try.
-Are we still talking about flowers?

17:54.573 --> 17:58.202
Thank you, ladies,
for those illuminating insights.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.872
Clearly the plants
aren't the only carnivores in class today.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.251
Good boy.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.046
Watch your butt. Watch your butt.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.173
-Hey. Where you going with Elvis?
-Just, uh…

18:13.217 --> 18:14.927
following a lead on a case.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.680
You still believe
there's a creature out there, don't you?

18:19.181 --> 18:22.851
I heard you and Santiago talking.
You think it's a Nevermore kid?

18:23.519 --> 18:24.895
Ran into your shrink.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.482
She was kind of tight-lipped
about your progress.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.901
It's called doctor-patient
confidentiality.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.820
How about father-son confidentiality?

18:32.903 --> 18:34.404
What are you two yakking about?

18:36.240 --> 18:40.119
Video games, cancel culture,
oat milk versus soy, it's a wild time.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.247
-I pay the bills, I got a right to ask.
-We talk about Mom.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.000
Remember her?

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
Better not be talking crap
about your old man.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.675
I'll be home late.
You're on your own for dinner.

18:54.758 --> 18:55.634
Oh, damn.

18:55.717 --> 18:59.388
I…I was hoping we could fire up the grill
and then catch the big game.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.350
Love these warm, fuzzy memories
we're making, Dad.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.569
I have to get back to the woods<i>,</i>

19:13.652 --> 19:16.989
but Weems has been watching me
like a vulture circling a carcass.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.031
And you want me to cover

19:18.115 --> 19:20.951
so that you can return to the scene
of a crime that didn't happen?

19:21.034 --> 19:22.786
I have beekeeping club this afternoon.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.413
I need you as decoy.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.290
Sorry. Two strikes.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.834
I'm busy and bees totally creep me out.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.796
Why don't you ask Thing?
Wait, you can't because he's mad at you.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.090
Why's he mad? He's the one who screwed up.

19:35.174 --> 19:39.303
All I know is that we spent an hour giving
each other manis, and he really opened up.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.055
He feels like
you don't respect him as a person.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.765
Technically, he's only a hand.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.059
Wednesday! He's your family.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.104
And he would do anything for you.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.523
Go apologize
and I'll reconsider helping you.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.796
I snapped at you.
I'll check my tone in the future.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.883
Now chop-chop,
before all our leads turn cold.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.267
What is it that you want?
Hand cream? Nail buffer?

20:27.351 --> 20:28.894
New cuticle scissors?

20:29.603 --> 20:30.646
Consider it done.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.914
I know I'm stubborn,
single-minded and obsessive.

20:48.997 --> 20:51.041
But those are all traits of great writers.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.962
Yes. And serial killers.

20:55.545 --> 20:56.672
What's your point?

20:58.799 --> 21:00.425
I have nothing to get off my chest,

21:00.509 --> 21:03.095
and I am not submitting
to your emotional blackmail.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.601
Fine.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.319
When Rowan showed me this,
it confirmed my greatest fear.

21:22.447 --> 21:25.033
That I'm going to be responsible
for something terrible.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.952
Not good terrible, like Ivan.

21:27.035 --> 21:27.869
Bad terrible.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.622
And I can't let that happen.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.417
That's why I need to find out the truth.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.507
Breathe a word of this to anyone
and I will end you.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.600
If Weems comes sniffing around,

21:50.684 --> 21:53.520
keep your distance,
look grim, and don't say a word.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.982
-Payback is going to be a bitch.
-I'd expect nothing less.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.278
Blab and I will squeeze you
like a honeycomb.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.280
Snitches get stung.

22:03.363 --> 22:04.531
It's hive code.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.034
Besides, I should be thanking you.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.953
This is the most girls
I've ever had in the shed.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
Other than bees.

22:11.955 --> 22:12.873
Shocking.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.752
I've always had a thing
for werewolf chicks.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.005
The chance that Enid ever becomes
romantically interested in you

22:20.088 --> 22:21.381
is less than 1%.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.966
So I've still got a shot?

22:23.050 --> 22:23.884
Yes!

22:30.974 --> 22:36.021
In ancient times, honey was used to treat
wounds and in sacrificial burial rites.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.440
Cleopatra was rumored to bathe in honey.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.192
Gave her skin a luminous glow.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.527
You ever taken a honey bath?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.363
I just don't wanna get stung.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.449
The key is to remain calm.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
Bees detect fear,
but you don't need to worry.

22:50.660 --> 22:54.581
Because I have a very big smoker,
and I handle it like a pro.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.375
Would you like to see it?

23:18.939 --> 23:22.067
Sorry. I didn't want Elvis
to pick up on your scent.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.361
Thanks. How'd you throw them off?

23:24.903 --> 23:25.737
Uh…

23:27.072 --> 23:28.907
-Coffee grounds?

23:30.283 --> 23:31.743
Deer-hunting hack.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.912
One of the perks
of being a part-time barista.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.832
I assume your father didn't bring
the bloodhound to play fetch.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.041
He doesn't tell me shit.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.002
You must think
it's weird I'm stalking him.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.297
No, I consistently stalk my parents.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.386
Hey, wait, what really happened
the other night at the festival?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.806
Look, I swear I won't say
anything to my dad.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.018
I thought Rowan was in danger.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.062
Turns out I was wrong.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.441
Then he proceeded to use his telekinesis
to try and choke me to death.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.569
Holy shit. Wh… Why would he do that?

24:05.652 --> 24:09.948
No idea. That's when this monster
came out of the shadows and gutted him.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.492
Whoa. Whoa.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.035
So… So you really saw it?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.873
And it didn't try to kill you?

24:17.956 --> 24:21.501
It actually saved me from Rowan.
That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.463
I came here to find something
that can prove he was murdered

24:24.546 --> 24:26.006
and that I haven't lost my mind.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.090
Yet.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.725
These are Rowan's.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.727
I knew it was a cover-up.

24:40.562 --> 24:41.688
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

24:41.771 --> 24:44.024
-So much of my…
-…my new desk, you psychopath!

24:45.066 --> 24:47.027
-Speaking of that--
-You creep people out!

24:48.862 --> 24:50.489
-You know--
-Unbelievable.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.573
I did.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.741
You're crazy!

24:58.413 --> 24:59.372
You okay?

25:05.754 --> 25:08.089
I keep seeing
that same purple book.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.468
The cover was darker.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.095
More like a day-old contusion.
Keep looking.

25:20.310 --> 25:25.232
I don't usually find students in here
looking for actual books.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.567
Most sneak in to make out.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.903
I accidentally walked in
on two vampires fanging.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.447
I can't unsee that.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.033
Is there something I can help you find?

25:38.078 --> 25:39.412
Have you seen this before?

25:39.913 --> 25:42.207
It's a watermark
from a book I'm looking for.

25:42.791 --> 25:46.336
I think it's the symbol
to an old student society. Um…

25:47.671 --> 25:48.672
The Nightshades.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.215
Like the deadly flower.

25:52.008 --> 25:52.884
Color me intrigued.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.387
I was told they disbanded years ago.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.972
Any idea why?

25:57.806 --> 25:58.682
Sorry.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.565
I was very impressed
with your answers in class today.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.192
My mother is
a carnivorous plant aficionado.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.236
I assume I get my red thumb from her.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.989
Are you and your mother close?

26:15.323 --> 26:18.410
Like two inmates sentenced to life
on the same cell block.

26:18.493 --> 26:22.747
I know it can't be easy…
showing up mid-semester.

26:22.831 --> 26:26.793
I've been here a year and a half,
and I still feel like an outsider.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.962
Because you're the only normie
on the staff?

26:30.505 --> 26:31.631
Enid told me.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.177
To tell you the truth,
I've never really fit in anywhere.

26:37.387 --> 26:41.182
Too odd for the normies,
not odd enough for the outcasts.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.560
I thought Nevermore would be different,

26:43.643 --> 26:47.606
but there's still a handful of teachers
who will barely acknowledge me.

26:48.898 --> 26:51.484
I act as if I don't care
if people dislike me.

26:53.903 --> 26:54.904
Deep down…

26:57.449 --> 26:58.533
I secretly enjoy it.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.747
-Never lose that, Wednesday.
-Lose what?

27:04.706 --> 27:07.959
The ability
to not let others define you.

27:08.918 --> 27:09.794
It's a gift.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.464
Doesn't always feel that way.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.926
The most interesting plants
grow in the shade.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.349
And if you ever need anyone to talk to,

27:22.432 --> 27:24.851
the door to the conservatory
is always open.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.671
That purple book has got to be
around here somewhere.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.880
Start investigating.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.547
Rowan's full of surprises.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.978
You're not supposed to be up here.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.646
Good to see you too.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.482
How'd you get past the Housemaster?
Use your siren powers?

28:54.566 --> 28:55.692
Not while wearing this.

28:56.276 --> 28:58.778
Would it kill you
to not think the worst of me for once?

28:58.862 --> 29:01.740
-What do you want, Bianca?
-To see how you're doing.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.076
I'm sorry about Rowan.
I know you guys used to be close.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.495
Since when did you
give a damn about Rowan?

29:07.579 --> 29:10.290
You were the one afraid
he'd do something to Wednesday.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.626
Isn't that why you've been following her
like an eager-eyed puppy?

29:13.710 --> 29:15.336
Or is there something more?

29:18.631 --> 29:21.050
Seriously, what do you see in her?

29:21.134 --> 29:24.846
You have a thing for a tragic goth girls
with funeral-parlor fashion sense?

29:24.929 --> 29:27.599
Maybe it's because
she hasn't tried to manipulate me.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.143
I make one mistake,
and you can't forgive me.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.187
She treats you like crap,
you can't get enough.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.563
Why are you fixated on Wednesday?

29:33.646 --> 29:36.065
Because she thinks
she's better than everyone else.

29:37.484 --> 29:40.278
I can't wait
to crush Ophelia Hall tomorrow

29:40.361 --> 29:42.781
and watch her werewolf roommate crumble.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.617
It's gonna be
a Poe Cup finale to remember.

29:45.700 --> 29:49.078
-I hate to think what you've got planned.
-My game's already started.

29:49.662 --> 29:50.789
I like to win.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.582
Is that so wrong?

29:53.917 --> 29:55.960
And you wonder why I broke up with you.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.713
You used to love my killer instinct.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.969
We were good together, Xavier.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.471
Were we?

30:07.138 --> 30:08.973
Is that just how you wanted me to feel?

30:12.560 --> 30:16.105
Trust me, Wednesday Addams
is not the girl of your dreams.

30:16.606 --> 30:18.691
She's the stuff of your nightmares.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.870
Where have you been?

30:30.954 --> 30:33.039
I'm literally having
a heart attack right now.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.958
-Yoko's in the infirmary!
-What happened?

30:35.041 --> 30:37.043
Garlic bread incident at dinner.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.963
She had a major allergic reaction.
She's out of the Poe Cup.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.172
I don't have a co-pilot.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.174
It wasn't an accident. Bianca's behind it.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.176
-How do you know?
-Doesn't matter.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.428
You and I are going to
take her down tomorrow.

30:48.054 --> 30:50.515
Wait. You're joining the Black Cats?

30:51.766 --> 30:53.268
You're willing to do that?

30:53.768 --> 30:54.727
For me?

30:56.771 --> 30:58.857
I want to humiliate Bianca so badly

30:58.940 --> 31:01.359
that the bitter taste of defeat
burns in her throat.

31:02.235 --> 31:05.405
Yeah, but mostly you're doing it
because we're friends, right?

31:07.740 --> 31:09.284
Tell me how she keeps winning.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.994
It's a real brain cramp.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.581
The past two years, no other boat has
made it across and back without sinking.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.999
Sounds like sabotage.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.917
There are no rules in the Poe Cup,

31:18.001 --> 31:21.045
and she is a siren,
which makes her master of the water.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.258
Then we just need
to beat her at her own game.

31:37.812 --> 31:40.189
-We're all set.
-Good. Thing's in position.

31:40.273 --> 31:43.651
-Wanna tell me what you two were up to?
-And spoil the surprise?

31:43.735 --> 31:47.196
Speaking of surprises,
your costume's in the tent.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.865
Costume?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.619
OMG, you look purr-fect!

31:52.702 --> 31:54.829
Only thing, where are your whiskers?

31:55.580 --> 31:58.124
Ask again,
and you'll be down to eight lives.

32:21.731 --> 32:22.732
Focus.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.903
What do we have here?

32:26.986 --> 32:28.404
The runt of the litter.

32:29.280 --> 32:32.575
For the record, I don't believe
I'm better than everyone else.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.827
Just that I'm better than you.

32:35.411 --> 32:39.415
I want to welcome you all
to the Edgar Allan Poe Cup.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.835
This is one of Nevermore's
proudest annual traditions,

32:42.919 --> 32:46.255
dating back 125 years.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.925
Each team must row across to Raven Island,

32:49.008 --> 32:51.219
pull a flag from Crackstone's Crypt,

32:51.302 --> 32:53.638
and hustle back
without sinking or being sunk.

32:54.389 --> 32:57.016
First team to cross the finish line
with their flag

32:57.100 --> 32:59.686
wins the cup
and bragging rights for a year,

32:59.769 --> 33:02.188
as well as some special privileges.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.148
Let the Poe Cup begin!

33:05.274 --> 33:06.442
Go! Go! Go!

33:07.986 --> 33:11.739
-Move. Faster!
-Come on, ladies. Let's go!

33:17.787 --> 33:19.247
Oh, excuse us!

33:44.605 --> 33:47.859
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!

34:00.038 --> 34:02.206
-Come on! Go!
-Come on!

34:15.720 --> 34:18.222
-Turn! Turn!
-Turn!

34:27.815 --> 34:29.650
Come on, man. We lost 'cause of you.

34:42.997 --> 34:44.123
Faster!

34:48.336 --> 34:49.170
Thing.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.024
Let's go. It's over here.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.536
Stay here and make sure
Bianca can't sabotage our boat.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.377
Thing, I need you to distract
a couple of jokers.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.891
-What?
-Come on.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.935
-Go.
-Let's get it.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.652
Let's go, man.

35:54.735 --> 35:55.820
She's right there.

35:55.903 --> 35:56.821
Come on.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.323
Later, Wednesday!

36:22.722 --> 36:23.848
You are the key.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.186
Taking a catnap?

36:39.739 --> 36:41.741
-Come on!
-Hurry up, we have to go!

36:50.208 --> 36:51.500
What's going on?

36:56.547 --> 36:58.090
See ya, jokers!

36:59.342 --> 37:00.343
Cheaters!

37:00.426 --> 37:05.056
I just asked myself, "WWWD?"
What Would Wednesday Do?

37:08.392 --> 37:11.229
The final two teams are the Gold Bugs…

37:13.689 --> 37:15.191
…and the Black Cats.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.284
Come on.

38:14.041 --> 38:14.917
Gotcha!

38:36.689 --> 38:37.606
Whoo!

38:39.191 --> 38:40.609
Yeah, we did it!

38:42.445 --> 38:44.071
OMG, Wednesday, we did it!

38:44.155 --> 38:47.283
This is the greatest moment
of my entire life.

38:47.783 --> 38:50.453
Admit it, you kinda got into
the whole school spirit thing.

38:54.457 --> 38:57.043
You didn't tell me
it was a dark, vengeful spirit.

39:02.506 --> 39:07.345
The first Poe Cup took place in 1897

39:07.428 --> 39:12.016
as a way to not only honor
Nevermore's most famous alumni,

39:12.099 --> 39:16.103
but to celebrate those values
that all outcasts share.

39:16.187 --> 39:21.484
Community, perseverance,
and determination.

39:21.567 --> 39:24.695
And we certainly saw those values
on display today.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.366
Yeah!

39:29.116 --> 39:30.659
Whoo!

39:30.743 --> 39:31.619
Yeah!

39:31.702 --> 39:34.747
Congratulations to Ophelia Hall!

39:35.498 --> 39:36.916
As a former resident,

39:36.999 --> 39:41.754
I will be happy to see the cup
back on the mantle after all these years.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.154
What are you doing down here?

40:08.072 --> 40:09.240
Hiding.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.909
People keep randomly smiling at me,
it's unsettling.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.411
It's called having your moment.

40:13.494 --> 40:16.080
You took down Bianca Barclay.
Try to enjoy it.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.791
The girls wanna know
if you wanna hang out later.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.835
Oh, come on, it won't kill you.

40:23.754 --> 40:24.922
I'll think about it.

40:28.759 --> 40:29.593
Yes!

40:29.677 --> 40:31.470
It's good to see you fitting in.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.681
Just like your mother.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.269
My mother and I are two different
people/species/everything.

40:40.896 --> 40:44.358
The last time
Ophelia Hall won the Poe Cup,

40:44.442 --> 40:46.235
your mother captained the team.

40:48.362 --> 40:49.989
I was her co-pilot.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.577
Maybe you two
are more alike than you think.

40:58.789 --> 40:59.707
I'm so excited.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.377
It was your job to help us win.
She's never lost. Never.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.385
<i>Nevermore continues to be an enigma.</i>

41:11.469 --> 41:14.221
<i>A place where the questions</i>
<i>far outweigh the answers.</i>

41:15.973 --> 41:17.558
<i>But sometimes…</i>

41:18.934 --> 41:21.228
<i>the answer is staring you</i>
<i>right in the face.</i>

41:32.698 --> 41:34.742
<i>Don't worry, Edgar Allan.</i>

41:34.825 --> 41:37.036
<i>I see your sanctimonious smirk.</i>

41:37.870 --> 41:39.830
<i>But I will get the last laugh.</i>

41:41.123 --> 41:43.459
<i>Your penchant for riddles was legendary.</i>

41:44.126 --> 41:46.504
<i>And this might be your cleverest yet.</i>

41:46.587 --> 41:48.464
<i>Because it's not a single riddle.</i>

41:48.547 --> 41:51.050
<i>Rather, each line is its own separate one.</i>

41:51.717 --> 41:54.011
<i>"The opposite of moon." Sun.</i>

41:54.595 --> 41:57.515
<i>"A world between ours." Nether.</i>

41:57.598 --> 42:00.059
<i>"Two months before June." April.</i>

42:00.601 --> 42:02.520
<i>"A self-seeding flower." Pansy.</i>

42:02.603 --> 42:03.896
<i>"One more than one." Two.</i>

42:03.979 --> 42:07.358
<i>"Its leaves weep to the ground." Willow.</i>
<i>"It melts in the sun." Ice.</i>

42:07.441 --> 42:09.401
<i>"Its beginning and end never found."</i>
<i>Circle.</i>

42:09.485 --> 42:11.946
<i>"Every rule has one." Exception.</i>

42:22.665 --> 42:24.792
<i>"The answer will give</i>
<i>a sharp cracking sound."</i>

43:08.252 --> 43:09.753
<i>Secret societies.</i>

43:09.837 --> 43:11.255
<i>Hidden libraries.</i>

43:12.298 --> 43:15.092
<i>My mother staring at me</i>
<i>in a judgmental way.</i>

43:16.385 --> 43:18.846
<i>These are all things I've come to expect.</i>

43:43.287 --> 43:45.289
<i>But the minute I inch towards the truth…</i>

43:46.248 --> 43:48.334
<i>Luckily, I'm not afraid of the dark.</i>
