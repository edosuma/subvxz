01:58.827 --> 02:02.295
Daniel, sometimes I feel

02:02.297 --> 02:05.698
that you could be, uh,
a little overly sensitive.

02:07.435 --> 02:11.104
Okay, uh, why, uh... why is
it that you feel that way?

02:11.106 --> 02:12.538
I don't know.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.574
I guess it's the way you are.

02:14.576 --> 02:16.809
I mean, you'll take
the most benign comment,

02:16.811 --> 02:19.178
and-and you'll take it
as a personal insult.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.580
It's extremely annoying.

02:20.582 --> 02:22.882
Positive language,
Commander.

02:24.552 --> 02:26.486
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

02:26.488 --> 02:30.256
Um, when you do that,
it is...

02:30.258 --> 02:32.859
the opposite
of pleasing to me.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.527
Is that okay?

02:34.529 --> 02:37.330
Okay, I think that the
reason that you, uh, think

02:37.332 --> 02:40.233
that I am so sensitive is
because I'm an actual person.

02:40.235 --> 02:41.901
I mean, I
have feelings.

02:41.903 --> 02:44.737
I'm not an animal, I'm not
a killing machine robot.

02:44.739 --> 02:46.005
Active listening,
Detective Williams.

02:46.007 --> 02:47.473
Don't deflect.

02:47.475 --> 02:50.676
This is stupid. I'm sorry,
but can we move on? I don't...

02:50.678 --> 02:53.780
Gentlemen, when I conducted
your psychological audit

02:53.782 --> 02:56.616
back in September,
you agreed

02:56.618 --> 02:59.585
to check in with me
and share your progress.

02:59.587 --> 03:01.521
Frankly, I'm not seeing any.

03:01.523 --> 03:04.724
Which leaves me to wonder
whether you should be

03:04.726 --> 03:06.692
coming here more regularly.
Wait a second.

03:06.694 --> 03:09.028
I didn't mean
to give you that impression,

03:09.030 --> 03:10.830
because things have actually
been great,

03:10.832 --> 03:12.098
right?
Yeah, it's true.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.666
Um, we've been getting
along a lot better.

03:13.668 --> 03:15.001
- More communicating.
- Right.

03:15.003 --> 03:16.235
Fighting a lot less. Mm-hmm.
Really?

03:16.237 --> 03:17.804
Yeah.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:17.806 --> 03:22.441
Mm, and how do you account
for this sudden breakthrough?

03:22.443 --> 03:23.709
Account...
Okay.

03:23.711 --> 03:25.745
Well, I would say,
if I'm being honest,

03:25.747 --> 03:28.514
that I think Steve is doing a
really, really, really good job

03:28.516 --> 03:30.449
with his control issues.

03:30.451 --> 03:32.318
He's working on it,
and he's doing good.

03:33.888 --> 03:36.556
Wow. And who's the
sensitive one now? You see?

03:36.558 --> 03:38.024
What did I say? Did I say
anything? I didn't say anything.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.358
No, no, no, you didn't
say... no, you didn't

03:39.360 --> 03:41.127
say anything, 'cause that
would require using words,

03:41.129 --> 03:42.562
uh, you know, to
articulate a thought.

03:42.564 --> 03:43.863
Why would... why would
you say anything?

03:43.865 --> 03:45.097
Why speak English
when you can just

03:45.099 --> 03:46.399
blow air out of your nose
Mouth.

03:46.401 --> 03:47.433
and tilt your head to...
Out of my mouth.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.634
It was your nose.
I know it.

03:48.636 --> 03:50.002
I saw it. It was your nose.
Ooh, Commander,

03:50.004 --> 03:51.504
I take it you disagree

03:51.506 --> 03:53.539
with Detective Williams'
assessment?

03:55.310 --> 03:57.376
Okay, actually,
you know what?

03:57.378 --> 03:59.579
Here's the real reason
we're getting along so great,

03:59.581 --> 04:01.080
is 'cause I don't listen
to him anymore.

04:01.082 --> 04:03.816
Uh, can we get back
to the control issue thing?

04:03.818 --> 04:05.685
Actually, we'll have
to get that next time.

04:05.687 --> 04:07.353
The hour is up.
Oh, wait, hold on.

04:07.355 --> 04:09.488
What next... what next time?
What next time?

04:09.490 --> 04:11.490
I'd like to
see you again, and...

04:11.492 --> 04:13.659
Me, us, or what?

04:13.661 --> 04:17.529
And I'm giving you both
something to take with you.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.868
What is it?

04:21.870 --> 04:24.303
That, gentlemen,
is your homework.

04:26.241 --> 04:27.707
Since you saw fit to waste

04:27.709 --> 04:29.375
almost the entire hour
attacking each other,

04:29.377 --> 04:32.511
you're going to do
a little conflict counseling

04:32.513 --> 04:33.713
on your own time,

04:33.715 --> 04:36.048
and I expect
that completed

04:36.050 --> 04:38.784
by our next session.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.368
Hey, Lou,
what's with the big turnout?

04:55.370 --> 04:57.570
Security guard
was one of ours.

04:57.572 --> 04:59.538
Mike Velasco.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.941
He made his pension
last year.

05:01.943 --> 05:03.075
Took a part-time job

05:03.077 --> 05:05.177
so he could spend more time
with his grandkids.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.947
We're doing a door-to-door
right now to see if anybody

05:07.949 --> 05:09.115
saw the perp fleeing.

05:09.117 --> 05:10.883
All right.
What about witnesses

05:10.885 --> 05:12.084
inside the store?

05:12.086 --> 05:14.720
No. All they saw was a guy
in a mask with a big gun.

05:14.722 --> 05:16.656
He was in and out,
got what he wanted, psh.

05:16.658 --> 05:18.724
<i> The whole thing</i>
<i>couldn't have lasted more than</i>

05:18.726 --> 05:20.059
a couple minutes.

05:20.061 --> 05:23.262
He shot Mike before he could
press the silent alarm.

05:26.134 --> 05:27.500
Move! I said, move!

05:27.502 --> 05:29.909
And then he made me
empty the safe.

05:29.910 --> 05:31.002
What was in the safe?

05:31.026 --> 05:33.609
About three million dollars
worth of loose diamonds.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.075
They were just
delivered last week.

05:36.077 --> 05:37.610
So who else knew
about that delivery?

05:37.612 --> 05:39.754
Just my staff
and our supplier.

05:39.755 --> 05:41.422
All right, Ms. Price,
we're gonna need a list

05:41.424 --> 05:43.390
of everybody who works
for you, of course,

05:43.392 --> 05:45.426
and whatever security footage
you have, please.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.056
Of course. I'll get
that for you right away.

05:47.057 --> 05:48.734
Thank you.

05:48.798 --> 05:51.231
All right,
so our thief

05:51.233 --> 05:53.000
didn't just do his homework.

05:53.002 --> 05:55.169
Somebody tipped him off about
that diamond delivery, right?

05:55.171 --> 05:57.337
Kono, what do you got?

05:57.339 --> 05:59.506
Witnesses described
a late-model Chevy Impala

05:59.508 --> 06:01.208
speeding away
around the time of the robbery.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.776
Canvass turned up tire treads

06:02.778 --> 06:04.278
consistent with
the make and model.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.646
All right,
tucked-away alley,

06:05.648 --> 06:08.882
just a block or two away
from the crime scene.

06:08.884 --> 06:11.018
This has got to be
the getaway car, right?

06:11.020 --> 06:12.686
Yeah, and there's
something else.

06:12.688 --> 06:14.288
It's a whole lot of blood.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.756
It's on the passenger side,

06:15.758 --> 06:17.424
so I'm thinking
our thief may have been shot

06:17.426 --> 06:18.625
by his own wheelman.

06:18.627 --> 06:20.160
That's a smart move.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.695
Let the guy with the gun
do all the work

06:21.697 --> 06:23.664
while you wait in the car.
He comes back, you pop him,

06:23.666 --> 06:25.098
- and you double your money.
- Low risk,

06:25.100 --> 06:26.400
big reward,
except for one thing.

06:26.402 --> 06:27.568
Where the hell's the body?

06:27.570 --> 06:28.802
Well, there's a blood trail

06:28.804 --> 06:30.304
leading away from the scene.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.173
HPD's still canvassing,
but looks like he got away.

06:34.210 --> 06:36.276
<i> CODIS just matched</i>
<i>our blood sample</i>

06:36.278 --> 06:38.445
to a guy named Jacob Anders.

06:38.447 --> 06:40.447
He's in the system
for aggravated assault

06:40.449 --> 06:42.049
- and one burglary charge.
- We need to check

06:42.051 --> 06:44.218
emergency rooms and look
into Anders' known associates,

06:44.220 --> 06:45.619
anybody he might
reach out to

06:45.621 --> 06:47.688
now that he's wounded
and on the run.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.356
Hey, check it out.

06:49.358 --> 06:50.557
Traffic cam

06:50.559 --> 06:52.793
just caught a black Impala
running a red light

06:52.795 --> 06:55.395
three blocks away
from our crime scene.

06:55.397 --> 06:59.233
Now, facial rec

06:59.235 --> 07:01.301
I.D.s the driver
as Emma Mills.

07:01.303 --> 07:05.372
The court documents indicate
she's this guy's girlfriend.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.040
It's a hell of a way
to break up with somebody.

07:07.042 --> 07:08.509
Kill him and cut him out of a
score. It's pretty cold-blooded.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.377
Well, no honor
among thieves.

07:10.379 --> 07:12.713
Anyway, GPS on Emma's
phone shows her to be

07:12.715 --> 07:13.914
at her apartment right now.

07:13.916 --> 07:15.115
You know, she must think

07:15.117 --> 07:16.350
Anders is dead.

07:16.352 --> 07:17.952
It's the only reason
she'd feel safe just

07:17.953 --> 07:19.820
sitting at home.
Well, HPD dispatch is

07:19.822 --> 07:21.622
sending the closest
unit available

07:21.624 --> 07:22.689
to pick her ass up.

07:22.691 --> 07:24.358
Whoa, no, no. Call them off.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.559
What?
Call them off.

07:25.561 --> 07:26.827
All right?
Anders is the priority.

07:26.829 --> 07:28.128
He's a cop killer.

07:28.130 --> 07:30.531
The best way to get
to that guy is keeping

07:30.533 --> 07:32.366
this girl in play.
Fine.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.567
Anders is gonna
patch himself up,

07:33.569 --> 07:34.835
and then he's gonna
come after Emma.

07:34.837 --> 07:36.703
When he does,
we're gonna be waiting for him.

07:49.850 --> 07:52.717
That's her.

07:52.719 --> 07:54.753
Oh, it's perfect.

07:54.755 --> 07:56.087
Thank you.
We'll take it. Excellent.

07:56.089 --> 07:58.657
This is crazy.
You cannot do this.

07:58.659 --> 07:59.791
Agnes is coming back this week.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.893
You're not supposed to do this.
Okay.

08:01.895 --> 08:03.528
How can you move into
somebody's apartment?

08:03.530 --> 08:04.929
I'll tell you how we do it.
Okay, see this is

08:04.931 --> 08:07.299
a court order, says we can do
anything we want. Anybody asks,

08:07.301 --> 08:08.967
I'm Agnes's nephew, and
we're just house-sitting, okay?

08:08.969 --> 08:10.402
It's gonna be fine. I promise.
No problem.

08:10.404 --> 08:11.770
Thank you so much.
She want everything

08:11.772 --> 08:12.971
just right!
You don't touch nothing!

08:12.973 --> 08:14.272
It's gonna be fine,
no problem, but okay.

08:14.274 --> 08:15.440
Thank you.
No touch!

08:15.442 --> 08:16.841
Mahalo.
Nothing, all right?

08:16.843 --> 08:18.777
All right. Smells in here.

08:18.779 --> 08:20.779
It's like, uh, loneliness
and despair.

08:20.781 --> 08:21.846
That's mothballs.

08:21.848 --> 08:24.482
Hopefully, Anders will,
uh, show up soon,

08:24.484 --> 08:26.751
and we can call
it a day, huh?

08:26.753 --> 08:28.853
Guess who's the queen of QVC.

08:31.591 --> 08:33.124
Oh.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.794
I get it. I got a match.

08:35.796 --> 08:37.095
Mr. Pickles.

08:37.097 --> 08:38.429
Hey! Oh!

08:38.432 --> 08:41.399
Hey, whoa, whoa! Oh!
What are you...?

08:41.400 --> 08:42.833
What is the matter with you?

08:42.836 --> 08:44.235
What's the matter
with me?

08:44.236 --> 08:46.071
Thing jumped out of nowhere.
I got scared. What do you want?

08:46.073 --> 08:48.139
What I want you to do--
maybe react like a grown man.

08:48.141 --> 08:49.474
How about that? It's a cat.

08:49.476 --> 08:50.775
Okay, let me explain
something to you

08:50.777 --> 08:52.077
that you do not know.

08:52.079 --> 08:53.745
I don't like...
I don't like cats.

08:53.747 --> 08:54.946
I love cats.

08:54.948 --> 08:56.514
Of course you love cats.
Yeah, I love cats.

08:56.516 --> 08:58.483
Who doesn't love cats?
They're awesome. They're like

08:58.485 --> 09:00.418
like adorable little ninjas.
They're smart, and they're fast,

09:00.420 --> 09:01.820
and they're, uh, cute
and cuddly at the same time.

09:01.822 --> 09:03.088
Help me with this.

09:03.090 --> 09:06.257
Okay, just so you know,
cats are disloyal, all right?

09:06.259 --> 09:08.259
They would eat their
owners if they could.

09:08.261 --> 09:09.761
That's right.
They'd turn on them and kill them.

09:09.763 --> 09:11.496
Yeah, they would.
You want to know why?

09:11.498 --> 09:13.098
'Cause they never lost
their predatory instinct.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.400
Put it up here.
Let's get the couch, too.

09:15.402 --> 09:16.668
For instance, a dog.
You take a dog.

09:16.670 --> 09:18.303
Take, like,
a domesticated canine,

09:18.305 --> 09:19.771
you put it in the wild.

09:19.773 --> 09:21.306
24 hours, that thing's dead.

09:21.308 --> 09:25.043
Okay, but a cat-- they never
forgot how to hunt and kill.

09:25.045 --> 09:27.045
Well, I guess that's why
you two get along then.

09:27.047 --> 09:28.346
That's why you like cats.

09:28.348 --> 09:29.881
Yeah. That's funny.
That's good.

09:29.883 --> 09:31.049
We got a situation here.

09:31.051 --> 09:32.584
What do we got?

09:32.586 --> 09:35.453
I mean, this...

09:35.455 --> 09:37.122
What do we do?
I mean, I don't know.

09:37.124 --> 09:39.491
What's the protocol? Do
we watch, do we not watch?

09:39.493 --> 09:41.092
I mean, it's our job.
That's what we're here for. We got to watch.

09:41.094 --> 09:42.460
I don't... It's not like...

09:42.462 --> 09:43.962
Okay.
No, don't do that.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.263
Lost visual.

09:45.265 --> 09:46.831
Um...

09:54.007 --> 09:55.840
I can't believe
she's still in the shower.

09:55.842 --> 09:57.175
Well, we got time
to kill.

09:57.177 --> 09:59.277
You, uh, maybe do a little bit
of homework, huh?

09:59.279 --> 10:00.879
You smashed this cat
to pieces,

10:00.881 --> 10:02.814
you know that, right?
I understand. Oh.

10:04.384 --> 10:05.817
I think I liked her
better as a brunette.

10:05.819 --> 10:09.387
Looks like she's ready
to split town.

10:09.389 --> 10:13.224
I'll give you five to one
the diamonds are in that book.

10:16.496 --> 10:18.363
Oh, yeah.
What did I say?

10:18.365 --> 10:20.532
Nobody under 30's
got books anymore.

10:21.401 --> 10:23.067
That's a big stone.

10:31.745 --> 10:32.977
Hello?

10:32.979 --> 10:34.112
He's dead.

10:34.114 --> 10:35.747
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

10:35.749 --> 10:36.981
What-what the hell happened?

10:36.983 --> 10:38.349
There were cops.

10:38.351 --> 10:39.751
They shot Jake.

10:39.753 --> 10:42.020
I just...
I don't know what to do.

10:42.022 --> 10:43.621
She's a good liar.

10:43.623 --> 10:44.956
Just relax, sweetheart.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.025
- Did the cops see you?
- No.

10:47.027 --> 10:49.294
I was able to get away
with the diamonds.

10:49.296 --> 10:50.795
Good.

10:50.797 --> 10:52.030
Then this doesn't change
our arrangement.

10:52.032 --> 10:53.865
I'll be there
in a couple of hours.

10:53.867 --> 10:55.133
Just lay low until then.

10:55.135 --> 10:58.336
Okay. Hurry, please.

11:01.374 --> 11:02.640
Wait a minute.
What?

11:02.642 --> 11:04.476
I heard that voice before.

11:04.478 --> 11:05.777
♪ Money, money, money, money ♪

11:05.779 --> 11:07.011
Hi, I'm Barry Burns,

11:07.013 --> 11:11.049
president and CEO
of Gold Blast USA,

11:11.051 --> 11:15.253
and I want to help you turn your
old and unwanted jewelry into...

11:15.255 --> 11:17.455
cold hard cash.
Guaranteed

11:17.457 --> 11:19.958
same voice, for sure.
Where did you even see this?

11:19.960 --> 11:21.793
It was on an infomercial.

11:21.795 --> 11:24.362
I have insomnia.
One of the benefits, you see.

11:24.364 --> 11:25.964
...silver, rings, bracelets

11:25.966 --> 11:26.998
and chains.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.235
We even buy... diamonds!

11:30.237 --> 11:31.903
He's got to be the
fence, this guy.

11:31.905 --> 11:34.172
If he shows up here, we're gonna
have to arrest them both,

11:34.174 --> 11:35.740
and then there goes our bait.

11:35.742 --> 11:37.842
Well, we got to make sure
Burns doesn't make it.

11:37.844 --> 11:40.411
<i>So, Mr. Burns,</i>

11:40.413 --> 11:42.914
HPD just pulled you over
with $2 million cash

11:42.916 --> 11:44.916
in your car.
Care to explain?

11:44.918 --> 11:48.319
Uh, sorry, since when is, uh,
being rich a crime?

11:48.321 --> 11:51.990
It isn't. But conspiracy
to commit a robbery is.

11:51.992 --> 11:54.959
And when a retired cop is killed
in the course of that robbery,

11:54.961 --> 11:57.195
then you become
an accessory to murder.

11:57.197 --> 11:58.429
We're up on Emma Mills.

11:58.431 --> 12:00.064
We know about the
deal you had in place

12:00.066 --> 12:02.033
to fence those diamonds
with her and Anders.

12:02.035 --> 12:05.136
Gentlemen, I-I think this is
the point in the conversation

12:05.138 --> 12:06.971
where I ask to call my lawyer.

12:06.973 --> 12:08.206
Actually, this is the point

12:08.208 --> 12:09.507
in the conversation
where you should listen.

12:09.509 --> 12:11.509
And listen carefully
because we're about to do you

12:11.511 --> 12:14.612
a very big favor.

12:15.448 --> 12:17.582
Emma lied to you.

12:17.584 --> 12:20.385
Anders was not killed
by the police. She shot him.

12:20.387 --> 12:22.120
And he's
still alive.

12:22.122 --> 12:24.055
Look at your face.

12:24.057 --> 12:25.990
What happened
to all them smart comments?

12:25.992 --> 12:27.325
Just dried right up, huh?

12:27.327 --> 12:29.761
She actually tried
to ice her own boyfriend

12:29.763 --> 12:31.763
just to cut him
out of the score.

12:31.765 --> 12:33.565
We're guessing she'll roll
over pretty easily

12:33.567 --> 12:35.333
on her fence.

12:40.307 --> 12:43.942
So, um, I gather the takeaway
is you're offering me a chance

12:43.944 --> 12:46.010
to screw Emma over
before she screws me.

12:46.012 --> 12:48.513
She's expecting you to show up
with the cash any minute, right?

12:48.515 --> 12:49.547
Yeah.

12:49.549 --> 12:50.582
All we're
asking you to do

12:50.584 --> 12:52.817
is call her and reschedule.

12:55.689 --> 12:57.889
Deal.

13:04.664 --> 13:06.297
You know, she
should've known

13:06.299 --> 13:08.266
she was playing with fire.
I mean, guys like Ivanovich,

13:08.268 --> 13:09.400
they don't die easily.

13:10.203 --> 13:12.203
Wait a minute.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.472
Who the hell is Ivanovich?

13:14.474 --> 13:18.109
<i> Trust me, somebody</i>
<i>you don't want to mess with.</i>

13:50.307 --> 13:52.474
Our thief's real name
is Radomir Ivanovich.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.099
He's former
Serbian Special Forces.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.634
After the Bosnian War,
he repurposed his skills

13:56.636 --> 13:58.803
to become
a high-end jewel thief.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.773
Pulled robberies all across
Europe, dropping lots of bodies

14:01.775 --> 14:03.775
along the way.
Now, a couple years back,

14:03.777 --> 14:07.145
he surfaces in Hawaii
under the name Jacob Anders.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.913
Now, he hooked up
with Emma Mills

14:08.915 --> 14:10.682
on a bunch of smash-and-grabs
until Emma

14:10.684 --> 14:11.849
finally got pinched.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.518
She never rolled
on the guy though,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.286
so she ended up serving
ten months in prison.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.688
Wait a minute. She does

14:16.690 --> 14:18.956
ten months for the guy and then
she gets out and shoots him?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.892
How's that make sense?
Don't know yet.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.527
But I'm gonna keep looking.
All right.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.329
Roger that.
Keep us posted, Chin.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.530
Copy.
This, uh...

14:25.532 --> 14:27.465
this broad's
got a lot of heart, huh?

14:29.969 --> 14:32.670
That cereal looks good,
doesn't it?

14:40.080 --> 14:43.081
What? I'm doing her a favor.
The food's gonna go bad.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.415
What the hell is the matter
with you? Who does...

14:44.417 --> 14:45.417
What are you, an animal?

14:45.418 --> 14:47.185
Okay? I know
you're lazy.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.252
You don't want to get up.
But I don't need

14:48.254 --> 14:50.521
your disgusting bagel plate
in my work space.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.658
That must be exhausting,
projecting that much contempt

14:53.660 --> 14:55.827
onto a... onto a
piece of porcelain.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.429
Ceramic, putz.
Oh?

15:01.901 --> 15:04.569
Hey, Mr. Pickles.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.571
Want something
to eat?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.608
Oh!

15:10.610 --> 15:12.243
Hey, Danny.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.511
Look at this.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.514
That's a lot
of weed.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.387
Yes. Hi.
Oh.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.921
Aloha, neighbor.
Hi. H-Hi.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.757
You must be
Agnes's nephew.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.024
I heard
you were house-sitting.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.259
No, that's me.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.894
Uh, news travels
fast around here.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.597
I'm Ruth Tennenbaum from 2D.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.466
I made you a batch
of my signature

15:35.468 --> 15:38.436
macadamia nut cookies.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.737
That's nice.

15:39.739 --> 15:43.241
Oh, I see you boys...

15:43.243 --> 15:45.910
like to snoop, too.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.211
Oh.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.348
Ruth, hi. Uh,
Ms. Tennenbaum.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.783
I'm Steve McGarrett.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.385
This is my partner,
Danny Williams.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.921
- I see.
- We're trying to keep a low profile.

15:56.923 --> 15:59.757
So if you could keep this
to yourself, it'd be nice.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.993
We don't want
anybody else in the building

16:01.995 --> 16:03.428
to find out.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.862
Oh, I understand.

16:04.864 --> 16:08.933
Some of the Alta cockers in our
building are so small-minded.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.401
Just so you know,

16:10.403 --> 16:13.671
I fully support...

16:13.673 --> 16:16.541
gay marriage.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.512
We're, uh...

16:21.514 --> 16:23.448
we're not gay.

16:23.450 --> 16:24.816
We're Five-O, ma'am.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.651
We're, uh... we're actually
working undercover here.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.520
That's why we can't, uh,
let anybody else

16:29.522 --> 16:30.888
find out about it, you see?

16:30.890 --> 16:32.123
It's-it's very important.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.525
Ms. Tennenbaum, can you...
you can keep a secret, right?

16:34.527 --> 16:37.395
Of course. To tell you
the truth, I-I feel much safer

16:37.397 --> 16:38.996
knowing you boys are here.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.164
Good. That's good.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.033
There's been a lot of crime
in this building.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.835
Just the other day,

16:43.837 --> 16:46.871
a plant was stolen from
right outside my front door.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.641
While you're here,
maybe you can catch

16:50.643 --> 16:52.677
the hoodlum who did it.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.679
Yeah, uh, we'd love
to help, but we're...

16:54.681 --> 16:56.481
you know,
we're kind of tied up.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.115
Oh, I understand.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.450
You're busy with
important police work.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.220
I'm just an old lady
with a stolen fern.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.589
Oh, did I mention
that it's a fern?

17:05.592 --> 17:07.992
Six years I had it.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.365
I don't mean to bother.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.369
You know what,

17:19.372 --> 17:23.875
um, I'm gonna send somebody
over to look into that.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.175
Okay?

17:25.178 --> 17:26.444
Such a sweet boy.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.479
Okay? So you go home,
and, uh...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.548
and you'll expect
to see somebody soon.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.783
All right?
Be sure

17:32.785 --> 17:34.752
to return the plate
when you're finished with it.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.786
Okay.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.388
Thank you very much
for the cookies.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.656
Okay. Come
here, Mr. Pickles.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.324
Thanks. Oh.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.560
Sweet kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Thank you. Yes. He-he is.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.262
He's-he's good.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.797
Okay. Bye-bye.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.432
Bye now.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.400
Bye-bye.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.969
Bye now.
Bye.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.571
I personally would've gone
with the, um...

17:53.573 --> 17:56.207
the gay thing to keep our cover.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.281
You hungry?
Let's get some dinner.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.883
You choose. Any place you want.
What do you want?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.952
Uh, Chinese
sounds good.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.755
I get a headache
from the MSG.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.958
Okay. Uh...
how 'bout, uh...

18:13.960 --> 18:15.860
how 'bout that pizza place
that doesn't suck?

18:15.862 --> 18:17.628
Oh, I got it. I got it,
I got it, I got it.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.729
You ever had Indian food?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.609
You're doing it wrong.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.077
I'm doing it wrong?

18:33.079 --> 18:35.112
Watch me.
Get a piece of naan.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.581
You dip it in the masala, okay?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.649
We got a little chicken there.
Get your chicken. Uh-huh.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.685
Put it inside,
make a little meat pocket,

18:40.687 --> 18:41.752
however you want to do it.
Okay.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.955
Then you go
mango chutney.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.557
Mango chutney.
Put it on top.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.859
Go.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.329
That's it.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.631
That's how you do it.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.533
Huh?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.401
Uh-huh.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.837
What's the matter?
You don't like it.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.639
No, I like it very much.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.008
It's probably one of best things I've ever
tasted in my entire life.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.543
In fact, I don't
know how it is

19:05.545 --> 19:07.144
that I've gone this
long in my life

19:07.146 --> 19:09.513
without experiencing
such exotic flavors.

19:09.515 --> 19:10.515
Huh?

19:10.516 --> 19:12.416
All right,
so what's the problem?

19:12.418 --> 19:13.951
The problem?
What's with your face?

19:13.953 --> 19:15.286
Well, the problem might be

19:15.288 --> 19:17.054
'cause you said I could
choose where we eat.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.857
What?
"You choose." You said, "You choose."

19:19.859 --> 19:21.959
You said, "You pick." And I
picked a bunch of places,

19:21.961 --> 19:23.961
you knocked them all down,
and then you picked a place

19:23.963 --> 19:26.030
that you wanted... Oh, I'm
glad you think it's funny.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.331
Are you kidding me?

19:27.333 --> 19:27.927
No.

19:27.952 --> 19:29.668
It's dinner, Danny.
What are you talking about?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.436
Well, no, that's the thing.
It's not just dinner, okay?

19:32.438 --> 19:35.906
This is what's called
relationship dominance.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.608
Okay? It's like you
having to drive my car.

19:37.610 --> 19:38.976
You always got to drive my car.
You got to be in control, Steve.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.045
Okay?
You get that from your workbook?

19:41.047 --> 19:42.480
I did get it from
my workbook, okay?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.115
It's a very enlightening
chapter, okay?

19:44.117 --> 19:46.150
It's all about
personality types.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.585
Oh, you're gonna
read it to me?

19:47.587 --> 19:50.988
Tell me this doesn't
sound like you, okay?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.924
"ESTJ, or Guardian types,

19:53.926 --> 19:56.494
"are confident,
dependable, loyal.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.862
"Natural leaders.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.064
"Tend to put
forth much effort

20:00.066 --> 20:02.366
in fulfilling their duties and obligations."
I'm sorry,

20:02.368 --> 20:03.501
can I stop you for a second?

20:03.503 --> 20:04.635
Am I supposed
to be offended?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.170
'Cause you just made me
sound awesome.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.406
Well, those are the strengths.
Now I'll get to the weaknesses.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.675
"Not naturally in tune with
what others are feeling.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.377
"Difficulty
expressing emotions.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.781
Difficulty accepting criticism."

20:16.783 --> 20:18.249
Hey, can I eat my meal?
Sound familiar? Yeah, you should.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.483
Can I eat my food in peace, all right?
It's fine.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.118
The...
Look. Look. Simple. Layman's terms,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.354
you are a whacked-out control freak, okay?
Yeah?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.656
But I love you,
and I really thank you a lot

20:25.658 --> 20:27.658
for introducing me
to this saag paneer

20:27.660 --> 20:29.827
or whatever it's called.
You're welcome.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.196
Agnes.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.232
Agnes isn't due back
till next week.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.643
I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong place.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.844
I'm pretty sure

20:46.846 --> 20:48.446
that's not possible,
considering you just

20:48.448 --> 20:50.181
let yourself in
with a key.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.716
Right.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.718
So what's up,
fellas?

20:53.720 --> 20:56.587
Uh, I'm house-sitting
for my Aunt Agnes. Who are you?

20:56.589 --> 20:59.623
Oh, I'm Ricky.
From downstairs. Yeah.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.958
Agnes has me check in

21:00.960 --> 21:02.526
on Mr. Pickles
while she's out of town.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.795
Guy needs lots of play
and stimulation

21:04.797 --> 21:06.163
or he gets a little moody,
you know?

21:06.165 --> 21:08.399
Cats are, like,
highly intelligent.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.167
He's a dog guy.
Oh.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.469
Lame sauce, bro.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.603
Cats are where it's Ats.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.771
Come here,

21:13.773 --> 21:15.773
little feller.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.041
Mee. Mee.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.242
Can you stop making
that noise, please?

21:18.244 --> 21:20.411
Mee. Ee-mee-mee. Ee-mee-mee.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.946
Please?
All right.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.881
I'm gonna feed
my main Menehune here,

21:23.883 --> 21:26.784
and then I'll let you dudes
get back to your chow.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.491
Let's see.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.226
Where did Agnes

21:35.228 --> 21:37.695
leave that cat food?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.563
You looking for this?

21:41.567 --> 21:44.835
Oh, no.
That's the, uh, catnip, bro.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.037
So I don't know how I feel
about this. You're storing dope

21:47.039 --> 21:48.606
at my, uh...
my aunt's place?

21:50.676 --> 21:51.909
It's pretty genius, right?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.145
That way, the cops can never
put me in the same room

21:54.147 --> 21:55.379
as the icky sticky.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.883
Ergo, Icky Ricky never gets
caught with the sticky.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.252
You dudes want to smoke a bowl
real quick? Family style?

22:01.254 --> 22:02.286
Uh, I'm good.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.655
He-he gets... crazy paranoid.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.457
Oh, hey, man,
if green ain't your scene,

22:06.459 --> 22:08.425
I can hook you up
with something else.

22:08.427 --> 22:09.660
Coke. X.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.195
Pills.
Anything you want.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.396
I got a connect.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.632
Even have a guy that
can get you snakes and ferrets.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.800
Yeah?

22:15.802 --> 22:16.767
They're banned
in Hawaii, you know?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.335
Because they're
invasive species.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.404
Yeah. We know that.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.973
Yeah, man, you dudes know
what's what. Here.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.209
Let me give you my card.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.212
"Ricky Schiff.
Travel agent."

22:28.214 --> 22:30.581
You want to go on a "trip,"
I'm the guy to call.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.849
Ah, yes.
Yeah.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.716
That's good.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.118
Nice. We'll call you.
Yeah.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.253
We will definitely call you.
Cool. Thanks, man.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.322
You guys enjoy.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.090
Be good, Mr. Pickles!

22:40.092 --> 22:41.759
Have fun!

22:41.761 --> 22:43.527
Later, skaters.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.505
The guy who sells the weed

22:54.507 --> 22:56.440
is in 2F.
What?

23:02.215 --> 23:04.481
A-Actually, I'm here
about the fern.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.283
Commander McGarrett
sent me.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.418
You tell him

23:07.420 --> 23:09.320
I don't want a new fern.

23:09.322 --> 23:11.922
I want the one
that was stolen from me.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.624
Oh, no, this isn't
a replacement.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.226
This is bait.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.594
You see...

23:16.596 --> 23:18.796
we're gonna set
this little guy

23:18.798 --> 23:21.098
outside your door to
lure the thief back.

23:21.100 --> 23:24.735
Only, this time,
we'll be watching.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.604
Oh. Oh!

23:26.606 --> 23:28.472
Aren't you
a clever boy.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.640
Come in.

23:29.642 --> 23:33.277
Could you describe
the pteridophyte?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.112
Who?
The fern.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.413
It wasn't <i> Adiantum,</i> was it?

23:36.415 --> 23:38.449
Commonly known as
a maidenhair fern.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.251
See, those require
regular watering,

23:40.253 --> 23:41.785
which would mean
we'd be racing

23:41.787 --> 23:44.121
against a ticking clock
to get it back safely.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.956
It's just a regular fern.

23:48.628 --> 23:52.329
Dijon or... or yellow mustard?

23:52.331 --> 23:53.597
Uh...

23:53.599 --> 23:55.099
Dijon, I guess.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.968
But, uh, like I said,
I already ate.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.403
Back to the crime in question.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.238
Do you have any enemies
in the building?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.908
Someone who might have taken
the fern out of revenge

24:03.910 --> 24:05.910
or maybe for leverage?

24:05.912 --> 24:07.311
Well, there's

24:07.313 --> 24:10.080
Eileen Chow--
don't get me started on her.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.750
But we can talk
about all that later.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.919
Right now I want
to talk about you.

24:14.921 --> 24:18.222
Is there a lady in your life,
maybe somebody

24:18.224 --> 24:20.824
you have your eye on?
Uh...

24:20.826 --> 24:22.660
no, not at the moment.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.728
Aw.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.631
Well, get on that,<i> bubeleh,</i>
'cause life isn't worth

24:27.633 --> 24:28.933
the price of admission

24:28.935 --> 24:32.336
if you don't have someone
to enjoy it with.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.374
And from the looks
of these pictures,

24:37.376 --> 24:39.710
you seem to have done
a lot of living yourself.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.745
Oh. I have.

24:41.747 --> 24:45.549
I slowed down since
my husband Morris passed away.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.653
I don't get out much these days.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.825
Eat.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.129
Cut in triangles.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.899
My mom does that.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.734
The good ones do.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.640
Mmm.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.147
Aw, that smells
disgusting, Steve.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.083
Who microwaves an omelet? Huh?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.617
The body needs protein.

25:20.619 --> 25:22.499
When you're not sleeping,
it needs it even more.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.956
What is that?
What are you doing?

25:25.958 --> 25:28.492
I'm doing a little,
uh, quiz out of this book:

25:28.494 --> 25:30.394
uh, how well
you know your partner.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.863
It asked me to list something
you were very passionate about.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.131
Oh, yeah?
What'd you write?

25:34.133 --> 25:35.399
Protein.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.234
Excuse me?

25:37.236 --> 25:39.003
Protein.
Protein?

25:39.005 --> 25:42.106
Well, you really, uh,
really peered into my soul.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.074
Okay, what are you
passionate about?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.411
Well...

25:47.413 --> 25:49.380
there's things
I'm passionate about.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.981
Like what?

25:53.419 --> 25:55.519
Music.
I'm passionate about music.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.221
That's a terrible
cop-out.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.489
I mean, everybody's
passionate about music.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.624
I like music, too. I mean,
Bon Jovi, I could tell you

26:00.626 --> 26:02.626
every song he ever wrote. Big deal.
Oh, no.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.794
I'm not passionate
about listening to music,

26:03.796 --> 26:04.895
I'm passionate
about playing music.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.263
Oh, you play music?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.564
That's funny,
just 'cause I've known you

26:07.566 --> 26:09.299
for a very long time
and never seen you

26:09.301 --> 26:12.202
even close to an instrument,
let alone playing one.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.738
Well, I used to play guitar.
Actually, I was really into it.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.839
I was quite good, too.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.975
But you stopped. Why'd you stop?

26:18.844 --> 26:21.145
Well, I don't know.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.781
I just stopped, didn't I?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.650
Oh, my God.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.261
Get in there.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.466
Hey, man.
Huh?

26:42.468 --> 26:45.769
The two of you haven't even
been here more than a day.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.571
How the hell does it smell
this bad already?

26:47.573 --> 26:50.441
Because this animal
is microwaving eggs.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.276
He...

26:52.278 --> 26:53.911
Oh, man, that's just reckless.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.680
Y'all need to get some Febreze
crackin' up in here, man.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.783
What's the matter with him?

27:02.655 --> 27:04.588
You have a cat in here!

27:04.590 --> 27:06.623
Yeah, here.
Oh, I'm highly allergic.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.258
Fine. Sit down. Sit.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.993
Come here.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.598
Oh.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.600
This is a true story.

27:16.602 --> 27:19.436
I lost my virginity
on a couch like this.

27:20.873 --> 27:22.906
Now, you'd think the
plastic would be a problem.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.842
- It's not.
- Huh.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.478
Okay, Dopey,
listen to me.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.446
You got a meeting
in 15 minutes with Emma,

27:29.448 --> 27:31.748
and you're gonna make
that meeting, you understand?

27:31.750 --> 27:33.717
But you're gonna tell her
you need another 24 hours

27:33.719 --> 27:35.219
to get the money together.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.988
Guys, no, I-I already
stalled her once.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.590
If I don't give
her the money,

27:39.592 --> 27:41.058
she's gonna shoot me
in the face.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.993
Okay, it's a risk
we're willing to take.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.896
Either you're playing me, or
you're a really terrible fence.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.965
Which one is it, Barry?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.100
Sweetheart, relax,
I'll have the money by tomorrow.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.102
Every cent, I swear.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.304
You better, Barry,
or I'm gonna hunt you down

27:54.306 --> 27:56.473
and put a bullet in you.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.208
Now, get the hell out.
All right, all right,

27:58.210 --> 27:59.243
I'll get it.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.811
All right, Lou,
he's coming down.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.045
10-4. We'll pick him up.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.547
Looks like
she's making a call.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.948
You get it?

28:04.950 --> 28:07.417
No. Son of a bitch says
he needs one more day.

28:07.419 --> 28:08.519
What if he's stalling?

28:08.521 --> 28:10.787
What if he knows I lied
about what happened?

28:10.789 --> 28:13.123
Relax. If he suspected anything,
he wouldn't have even shown.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.259
Just reschedule your flight
for tomorrow, and I'll see you

28:15.261 --> 28:17.261
in a couple weeks.
No, I can't wait that long.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.363
Please.
Okay. I'll see you tonight.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.936
<i> So, what happened?</i>

28:25.938 --> 28:27.604
It doesn't matter.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.440
That's the-the broad
from the jewelry shop.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.508
That's Mia Price.

28:31.510 --> 28:34.611
Okay, so this <i> was</i> an inside job.

28:34.613 --> 28:37.014
She helped them
rob her own store.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.751
I didn't ask you over
to talk about Barry.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.259
Oh, uh...

28:49.261 --> 28:50.460
looks like
she's getting more than

28:50.462 --> 28:51.762
just a piece of the action, huh?

29:02.353 --> 29:03.953
I took another look
at the security footage,

29:03.955 --> 29:05.121
and check this out.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.091
Right before the robbery,

29:08.093 --> 29:09.827
Price glances at her watch.

29:09.829 --> 29:12.229
And then take a look
at what else she does.

29:12.231 --> 29:15.532
She calls the guard over so
he won't be by the silent alarm.

29:15.534 --> 29:17.634
And she doesn't know he's
an ex-cop, that's he's not gonna

29:17.636 --> 29:19.603
lay down if his job
is to protect the place.

29:19.605 --> 29:21.171
Now, financials show
that the business

29:21.173 --> 29:23.607
had been struggling for years,
but just two weeks ago,

29:23.609 --> 29:26.043
Price maxed out her credit
on a huge order

29:26.045 --> 29:27.277
with her diamond supplier.

29:27.279 --> 29:29.112
Just in time
for the robbery.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.350
All right, so...

29:33.352 --> 29:35.853
Price helps these guys
pull this thing off for a cut.

29:35.855 --> 29:38.088
She also gets
her insurance money.

29:38.090 --> 29:39.456
Nobody knows nothing.

29:39.458 --> 29:40.657
Everybody wins.

29:40.659 --> 29:42.192
Except somewhere along the way,

29:42.194 --> 29:44.728
Emma decides to hook up
with Price and cut Ivanovich

29:44.730 --> 29:46.096
out of the equation, right?

29:46.098 --> 29:48.065
It's a bold move, taking out

29:48.067 --> 29:49.433
a Serbian badass.

29:49.435 --> 29:51.468
I'm guessing that Price

29:51.470 --> 29:53.837
<i>had no idea who she was</i>
<i>double-crossing.</i>

29:53.839 --> 29:56.173
Hello there.

29:56.175 --> 29:57.507
How can I help you exercise

29:57.509 --> 30:00.010
your Second Amendment
rights this evening?

30:15.594 --> 30:18.896
I fell asleep.

30:18.898 --> 30:20.864
I miss anything?

30:26.705 --> 30:28.438
Apparently not.

30:29.608 --> 30:32.175
They stopped for a water break
about half an hour ago.

30:32.177 --> 30:34.578
That's good. You got to stay hydrated.
Very important.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.947
See this? This is bad
for us men in general.

30:36.949 --> 30:38.749
This is what gives us
a bad name.

30:38.751 --> 30:40.751
20, 30 minutes--
that includes a drink.

30:40.753 --> 30:42.185
That's three hours--
make us look terrible.

30:42.187 --> 30:43.887
This is impossible.
We can't do this.

30:46.258 --> 30:47.925
You, uh...

30:47.927 --> 30:49.826
you reading the workbook?

30:49.828 --> 30:52.262
No.
No? It was over here,

30:52.264 --> 30:54.164
now it's over there; you had
to do something with it.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.133
When you fell asleep,
you dropped it on the floor.

30:56.135 --> 30:58.302
I moved it for
you over here.

30:58.304 --> 30:59.703
You didn't look at it?

30:59.705 --> 31:02.172
I look at it? Maybe... yeah,
I looked at it a little bit.

31:02.174 --> 31:04.174
I skimmed through it a
little bit; I was bored.

31:04.176 --> 31:05.709
What'd you think?

31:05.711 --> 31:07.678
Uh...

31:07.680 --> 31:08.779
That's it?

31:08.781 --> 31:10.180
You're unbelievable.

31:10.182 --> 31:12.950
I mean, I-I have seen you
personally put yourself

31:12.952 --> 31:14.718
in every conceivable
life-threatening situation

31:14.720 --> 31:16.420
without batting an eye,
like it's nothing.

31:16.422 --> 31:18.722
But when it comes
to talking about your feelings,

31:18.724 --> 31:20.557
forget about it,
you'd rather chew cyanide.

31:21.427 --> 31:23.026
Huh?

31:23.028 --> 31:24.494
Forget it.

31:24.496 --> 31:28.131
Wake me up if they stop or
do something interesting, or..

31:28.133 --> 31:30.300
open up their curtains.

31:45.351 --> 31:49.186
You want to know why I
don't play guitar anymore?

31:49.188 --> 31:53.190
Yes, I would like to know why
you don't play guitar anymore.

31:57.529 --> 31:59.963
Tenth grade talent show.

32:03.268 --> 32:05.469
I signed up to perform.

32:07.473 --> 32:09.272
I practiced the song

32:09.274 --> 32:12.909
every day for months and months,
and the day finally came around.

32:12.911 --> 32:14.644
I was standing in the wings.

32:14.646 --> 32:17.214
<i>My guitar was in tune.</i>

32:17.216 --> 32:19.916
<i>They called my name,</i>
<i>I walked out on stage.</i>

32:22.488 --> 32:25.655
I turn around
and look at all those people.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.233
<i>And I couldn't do it.</i>

32:36.235 --> 32:38.702
I couldn't do it,
so I walked off

32:38.704 --> 32:41.238
and never played guitar
ever again.

32:42.574 --> 32:44.007
That's it?

32:44.009 --> 32:46.643
That's it.

32:46.645 --> 32:48.678
Tenth grade,
you had stage fright,

32:48.680 --> 32:51.281
so you never played guitar
ever again?

32:51.283 --> 32:54.117
I didn't have stage fright;
it was bigger than that.

32:54.119 --> 32:57.187
I'm telling you, man,
it was a, uh...

32:57.189 --> 33:00.223
You know, I guess it was
an existential crisis.

33:00.225 --> 33:02.359
I just, in that moment,
I couldn't handle

33:02.361 --> 33:05.228
the-the vulnerability
that I was experiencing.

33:05.230 --> 33:09.066
I couldn't handle
how exposed I felt.

33:09.068 --> 33:11.101
I felt like I couldn't breathe,

33:11.103 --> 33:14.104
and I thought it
was gonna kill me.

33:16.175 --> 33:19.943
Look, man, I was raised
differently than you, okay?

33:19.945 --> 33:21.578
I wasn't raised
in a house

33:21.580 --> 33:23.814
with a supportive family

33:23.816 --> 33:27.017
encouraging me
to share my feelings.

33:27.019 --> 33:29.319
And in your case,
every feeling.

33:34.193 --> 33:35.892
The McGarrett men are

33:35.894 --> 33:38.829
a different breed. They...

33:38.831 --> 33:42.566
To them, showing emotion is like
showing weakness, you know?

33:42.568 --> 33:45.368
I mean, it's stupid,
but it's just the way it is.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.771
Mm, I understand that, um...

33:47.773 --> 33:50.307
I just figure after everything
we've been through, you know--

33:50.309 --> 33:53.143
your father, my brother,
everything--

33:53.145 --> 33:55.378
I figured maybe I was, you know,

33:55.380 --> 33:58.348
somebody that you could
open up to, is all, you know?

33:58.350 --> 34:00.550
I just did.

34:07.259 --> 34:10.060
Where's the cat?

34:10.062 --> 34:13.697
Oof. I swear I didn't
leave it open on purpose.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.532
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

34:15.534 --> 34:17.434
If I had just
gotten to my piece

34:17.436 --> 34:18.869
fast enough,

34:18.871 --> 34:21.338
you guys would be taking him
out of here in a bag.

34:21.340 --> 34:24.074
Okay, Norm, do you, uh...
do you know what he stole?

34:24.076 --> 34:25.076
Guns, ammo?

34:25.077 --> 34:27.677
He took a lot more
than just guns.

34:29.614 --> 34:32.114
<i>It sounds like Ivanovich</i>

34:32.117 --> 34:33.416
is gearing up for a war.

34:33.418 --> 34:34.650
According to Norm, he stole

34:34.652 --> 34:36.453
small and large arms,
body armor,

34:36.455 --> 34:37.587
explosives-- the works.

34:37.589 --> 34:38.889
Sounds like an awful lot of

34:38.891 --> 34:41.824
firepower to go
after one girl.

34:41.827 --> 34:42.926
Looks like Price
is on the move.

34:42.928 --> 34:44.261
Okay, I'll keep eyes on her

34:44.263 --> 34:45.529
and put a detail on the store.

34:45.531 --> 34:47.964
See you guys later.

34:47.966 --> 34:49.533
I'll get it.

34:49.534 --> 34:51.234
You'll get it?
Were you expecting someone?

34:54.907 --> 34:56.940
What up, playboy?

35:00.078 --> 35:03.046
What the hell is this?

35:03.048 --> 35:05.549
Cat's sense of smell is 14 times
stronger than a human's.

35:06.552 --> 35:08.351
And that sweet scent
of Agnes is gonna

35:08.353 --> 35:09.686
bring Mr. Pickles back home.

35:09.688 --> 35:11.321
Stay frosty.

35:18.030 --> 35:20.263
You called the drug dealer

35:20.265 --> 35:21.765
to find Mr. Pickles?

35:21.767 --> 35:23.667
And why did I have
to do that, Danny?

35:23.669 --> 35:25.435
No, no, no. Don't do this, okay?

35:25.437 --> 35:26.736
It's not my fault,
it's your fault.

35:26.738 --> 35:28.705
How is this my fault
Mr. Pickles got out?

35:28.707 --> 35:30.340
You're the reason;
you left the window open.

35:30.342 --> 35:32.676
Well, I wouldn't have had to
leave the window open if you

35:32.678 --> 35:34.678
hadn't decided it was a good
idea to make a microwave omelet.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.079
You know what, this whole
passive-aggressive thing?

35:36.081 --> 35:37.614
I'm done. I'm tired.
It's tired.

35:37.616 --> 35:38.648
All right, let's do
aggressive-aggressive.

35:38.650 --> 35:39.983
You want that?
How do you want to do it?

35:39.985 --> 35:41.518
'Cause I could...

35:41.520 --> 35:42.953
What the hell are you doing?!

35:42.955 --> 35:44.788
It's not our girl.

35:44.790 --> 35:46.289
I got it.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.525
Two floors down.
Apartment on the end.

35:50.329 --> 35:51.628
Not good.
We got to do something.

36:02.674 --> 36:05.175
We just got played.

36:16.488 --> 36:17.454
Pulse is fading.

36:17.456 --> 36:18.788
This is
Detective Williams.

36:18.790 --> 36:20.557
I got a shooting
victim at 2119

36:20.559 --> 36:21.858
Kuhio Avenue,

36:21.860 --> 36:23.660
503. Expedite EMS.

36:23.662 --> 36:25.161
Stay with us.

36:25.163 --> 36:26.930
Diamonds are gone.

36:31.103 --> 36:33.270
She's dead.

36:48.987 --> 36:50.553
Stop, right there.

36:50.555 --> 36:53.055
You thought
you could steal from me?

36:55.193 --> 36:58.361
Got a feeling I know
where he's going next.

37:00.965 --> 37:03.232
Mia Price,
you're under arrest.

37:03.234 --> 37:04.967
Hands behind your back.

37:04.969 --> 37:06.535
Wait, what? What's going on?

37:06.537 --> 37:08.037
You have the right
to remain Si...

37:34.132 --> 37:36.332
How big is your safe?

38:00.158 --> 38:01.757
You double-crossed me.

38:05.630 --> 38:07.730
Where was I?

38:07.732 --> 38:09.799
That's right.

38:09.801 --> 38:13.069
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:20.845 --> 38:23.045
Thanks, Duke.

38:24.649 --> 38:28.117
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

38:28.119 --> 38:30.786
Well, uh, we're-we're cops.

38:33.391 --> 38:36.092
Oh.

38:36.094 --> 38:37.526
That's really bad.

38:37.528 --> 38:39.028
For me, I mean.

38:39.030 --> 38:40.930
Well, it's not
good for you.

38:40.932 --> 38:45.034
Despite incriminating yourself
in half a dozen felonies,

38:45.036 --> 38:47.636
you found Mr. Pickles and
you brought him back,

38:47.638 --> 38:49.839
so for that we're gonna
give you a pass.

38:49.841 --> 38:51.340
Whew.
Thank you.

38:51.342 --> 38:53.476
Yeah. Yeah.
But you got to give

38:53.478 --> 38:56.579
all the names of your suppliers
to Lukela here.

38:56.581 --> 38:59.081
Sell my boys out?

38:59.083 --> 39:00.416
No way.

39:00.418 --> 39:01.984
Not gonna happen, bruddah.

39:01.986 --> 39:03.419
I'm no snitch.

39:05.723 --> 39:07.323
This should be obvious,

39:07.325 --> 39:09.992
but if you don't cooperate,
you go to jail.

39:17.635 --> 39:20.369
Who's got a pen?
There are a lot of names.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.559
♪ ♪

40:05.583 --> 40:07.850

40:21.599 --> 40:23.566
I'm really sorry, but...

40:23.568 --> 40:26.669
I'm afraid this mystery
may go unsolved.

40:26.671 --> 40:29.672
Oh, well, that's okay,<i> bubeleh.</i>

40:29.674 --> 40:32.274
What's important
is that you tried.

40:33.878 --> 40:35.778
You know, Ruth,

40:35.780 --> 40:39.682
I know it's easy to focus
on the things we're missing.

40:39.684 --> 40:42.651
But it's really important
to appreciate what's around us.

40:42.653 --> 40:45.521
Because when you
actually get out there,

40:45.523 --> 40:48.824
you know, and take a look...

40:54.065 --> 40:56.265
...it can be really beautiful.

41:06.010 --> 41:08.177
You're right.

41:10.248 --> 41:12.414
Thank you.

41:17.521 --> 41:19.722
<i> Tell you the truth,</i>
<i>I don't even think</i>

41:19.724 --> 41:21.056
<i>there was a fern.</i>

41:21.058 --> 41:23.993
I just think she wanted
someone to talk to.

41:23.995 --> 41:25.828
You know what, whatever
you did, it worked.

41:25.830 --> 41:28.330
She seems happy. Good
job, Jerry. Well done.

41:28.332 --> 41:29.698
Mahalo.
Thank you.

41:29.700 --> 41:30.866
So she asks her husband,

41:30.868 --> 41:34.403
"What does Mrs. Goldberg
have that I don't?"

41:34.405 --> 41:37.106
And the old man
looks at her and he says,

41:37.108 --> 41:38.507
"Parkinson's."

41:44.482 --> 41:46.882
Jerry, your friend here has
a filthy sense of humor.

41:46.884 --> 41:48.884
And we fully approve,
by the way.

41:48.886 --> 41:51.553
This is some

41:51.555 --> 41:52.688
good-looking <i> treif.</i>

41:52.690 --> 41:53.889
Let's start you off

41:53.891 --> 41:55.524
with a piece of resistance.

41:55.526 --> 41:56.892
My garlic shrimp.

41:56.894 --> 41:58.560
Take it easy on the garlic.

41:58.562 --> 42:00.763
I'm thinking
of making a move on that

42:00.765 --> 42:03.299
silver fox over there.

42:03.301 --> 42:06.302
Nice. I think he was
checking you out, too.

42:07.738 --> 42:10.673
I got to go, guys.
I got something with Danny

42:10.675 --> 42:13.008
I got to take care of.
You late for an argument?

42:13.010 --> 42:14.476
Oh, the marriage counseling.

42:14.478 --> 42:15.911
How's that going?

42:15.913 --> 42:17.680
Yeah, you rekindling
your romance?

42:17.682 --> 42:19.548
Yeah, yeah, very good, guys.
I'm confused.

42:19.550 --> 42:21.617
I thought they <i> weren't</i> married.

42:21.619 --> 42:22.718
No, they're not.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.586
They just fight
like an old couple.

42:26.090 --> 42:27.423
Got your homework ready?

42:27.425 --> 42:29.291
Dog ate it.
Oh. Oh.

42:29.293 --> 42:30.659
Look, I got
something for you.

42:30.661 --> 42:31.860
You got something for me?

42:31.862 --> 42:34.029
I do.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.266
There you go.

42:41.339 --> 42:42.838
What is this?

42:42.840 --> 42:45.140
What is it?
Well, it's a tuba, you schmuck.

42:45.142 --> 42:46.775
What does it look like?

42:46.777 --> 42:48.777
You got me a tuba?

42:48.779 --> 42:50.145
Yeah.

42:51.949 --> 42:53.849
Danny, Danny, Danny.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.154
Huh? Huh?

42:59.156 --> 43:00.322
Danny, that's, uh...

43:00.324 --> 43:01.957
Nice, right?
Nice?

43:01.959 --> 43:03.392
Yeah.
It's-it's beautiful.

43:03.394 --> 43:04.526
You kidding me?

43:04.528 --> 43:06.395
Figured you start
playing again, maybe play

43:06.397 --> 43:07.830
that song you never got to play.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.433
This is really, uh...
This is...

43:11.435 --> 43:13.302
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

43:13.304 --> 43:15.671
Let's go before the, uh,
lady has a panic attack.

43:15.673 --> 43:17.239
Hey, man, thank
you, all right?

43:17.241 --> 43:18.140
Uh-huh.

43:18.142 --> 43:19.508
Oh, listen,
by the way,

43:19.510 --> 43:21.010
why don't you drive.

43:22.346 --> 43:25.080
I drive.

43:26.350 --> 43:29.218
Wow. Definitely a breakthrough
here, Steve.

43:29.220 --> 43:31.153
Just don't get
too excited, all right?

43:31.155 --> 43:32.888
I'm still controlling the radio.

43:35.026 --> 43:37.226
All right.
