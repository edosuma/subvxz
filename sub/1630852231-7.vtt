00:06.040 --> 00:07.940
♪ ♪

00:07.975 --> 00:09.375
CHRIS: I'd like to
check a few different

00:09.410 --> 00:10.976
beaver dens today.

00:11.012 --> 00:13.112
This one's always been
good to us in the past.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.181
Oh, yeah.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.816
There's the den
from last year.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.185
But, no beaver sign.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.121
JESSI: There's no
feed pile over there.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.655
CHRIS: Yeah, that's
really strange that
there's no feed pile.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.625
Normally, it's just a
bunch of twigs sticking
out of the ground.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.127
Let's keep cruising.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.229
Let's see if we
can get any more signing
before the sun sets.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.964
We got just a
little bit longer.

00:31.999 --> 00:33.432
JESSI: All right.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.369
CHRIS: So, the logical
choice is these beavers
moved into the river.

00:37.405 --> 00:38.871
Lakes are a lot
safer to trap in,

00:38.906 --> 00:40.839
mostly because
there's no moving water.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.340
At least in a lake,
if you fall through.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.076
JESSI: Ah!

00:44.111 --> 00:45.344
CHRIS: Whoa! I'm here. I'm here!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.579
You just hold still and hope
to bob right back up the same

00:47.615 --> 00:49.014
hole you went in.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.482
In a river,
if you go through,

00:50.518 --> 00:52.051
the current will catch
you and take you down.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.586
That's it.
You're not coming back up.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.489
Best-case scenario
is death quick.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.825
Worst-case scenario
is starving to death,

00:59.860 --> 01:02.261
and I don't want
to starve to death.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.703
CHRIS: Hey,
check it out, Jess.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.239
Getting some beaver
sign in here.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.644
JESSI: Some over there.
CHRIS: All right.

01:18.679 --> 01:19.945
JESSI: Here a beaver,
there a beaver,

01:19.980 --> 01:21.113
everywhere a beav-beav!

01:21.148 --> 01:22.881
CHRIS: If we can
find this den,

01:22.917 --> 01:23.782
that'll be really awesome.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.250
That's gonna be a
good source of meat.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.286
Let's keep cruising.

01:27.321 --> 01:28.987
It looks like the
river's right here.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.590
Then let's walk down and see
if we can see any of the dens.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.592
JESSI: Let's go.
I'll follow you.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.228
CHRIS: Looks like
I can get down here.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.797
I'm gonna try to work my
way down and see if I can

01:38.833 --> 01:40.732
spot any signs of
beaver down there.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.302
JESSI: Okay.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.171
CHRIS: I'll let you
know what it looks like.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.408
JESSI: I'll be here.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.443
CHRIS: Oh, this
is gonna be steep.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.579
(bleep).

01:53.614 --> 01:55.914
Get my axe over here.

01:55.950 --> 01:56.815
JESSI: Whew!

01:56.851 --> 01:58.083
CHRIS: That worked out well.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.952
What we've learned about
living out at the Cosna is

01:59.987 --> 02:02.688
it's really hard to
get big game out here.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.556
We're just coming
into beaver season.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.858
We gotta get back up and
start trapping right away.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.828
I'm just trying to get
down to this next level okay.

02:11.866 --> 02:14.166
I'm gonna check out
the riverbank here.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.605
Oh man, it is slick.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.609
Sounds hollow down here.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.245
I think we're working
with some shelf ice.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.813
I gotta be real careful.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.449
One of the most
dangerous things on the
river is the shelf ice.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.385
It'll be just
a couple inches of ice with
insulating snow on top.

02:33.420 --> 02:34.720
And when you fall
through that,

02:34.755 --> 02:36.855
it's just open water
underneath with swift current.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.123
So you gotta watch out.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.291
JESSI: Watch your footing.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.293
You never know when you're
going to fall in somewhere.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.930
CHRIS: Yeah, right by this
hole here is really tilted.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.499
Oh yeah!

02:47.535 --> 02:49.935
Looks like it might be the
entrance down here, Jess.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.837
That's where I think
they're going in.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.705
JESSI: All right.
Well, I mean.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.407
We got a spot, right?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.042
CHRIS: Yeah.
I don't feel as safe.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.745
I don't know river
trapping as much.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.381
JESSI: Hands down, we gotta
set some snares for winter.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.382
You know what I mean?

03:03.417 --> 03:04.850
CHRIS: Yeah.
I'm gonna come back up.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.085
JESSI: Okay.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.761
MICHAEL:
Being self-reliant out here,

03:15.796 --> 03:18.430
you gotta be mindful of
what you're spending money on.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.299
You gotta be super frugal.

03:20.968 --> 03:24.036
You'll never see anything
I use that's frivolous
in any nature.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.438
Everything is very
utilitarian out here.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.746
(engine starts)

03:38.085 --> 03:40.586
MICHAEL: Not bad for 500 bucks.

03:40.621 --> 03:44.823
Recently, I sold my fat tire
bike for about $800,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.659
and I had no early season
training device for the dogs.

03:49.063 --> 03:52.798
And I can't really afford
an ATV or a side-by-side.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.733
And poverty breeds ingenuity.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.704
I bought this hooptie
for 500 bucks.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.841
This little tiny four-wheel
drive may look like something

04:02.876 --> 04:06.011
that your sister
or your little baby brother
would take to college,

04:06.747 --> 04:07.879
but I'll tell you what.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.982
This thing's a
straight up sleeper.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.589
And so this little
tiny four-wheel drive,

04:17.625 --> 04:20.659
I am gonna convert this into
a lawn and garden tractor.

04:20.694 --> 04:24.463
And I am also going to use
it to train my dog team

04:25.132 --> 04:27.599
while I wait for the
snowpack to increase.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.506
Winter is here and the
dogs are all excited.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.875
They kinda sit and take it
easy through the summer,

04:36.910 --> 04:40.479
but they actually
do need to start
working early in the season,

04:40.514 --> 04:43.849
that way they're
ready for expeditions
and winter caribou hunts.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.519
And so just like any athlete,
you have to train.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.087
Get those
muscles conditioned,

04:49.123 --> 04:51.056
get those
tendons tightened up.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.224
Yeah. There we go! There we go!

04:52.259 --> 04:54.826
A dog sled flexing over
roots in low snow conditions,

04:54.862 --> 04:58.263
it's excessive wear on the
sled for no good reason.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.166
So, while I wait for the
snowpack to get proper,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.703
I can use this on my
local trails and roads,

05:04.738 --> 05:08.840
and all I gotta do is
modify it just a wee bit.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.443
All right.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.780
So the idea that I come up
with is that I'm gonna cut the

05:14.815 --> 05:18.183
entire top of the
vehicle off to about this

05:18.218 --> 05:19.651
point right here.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.854
That way, there I have a
little cab over my head.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.457
And I'm going to leave
all the structure in here,

05:25.492 --> 05:27.459
all the side structure.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.762
And so it'll be just kinda
like a utility rack integrally

05:30.798 --> 05:31.997
built into the vehicle.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.832
I'm also gonna yank
the seat out of it and

05:33.867 --> 05:35.167
all the interior.

05:35.202 --> 05:39.471
It's going from SUV to mini
truck with a utility rack.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.941
And that starts now.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.311
I have high hopes
for this thing.

05:46.347 --> 05:51.516
I think it's gonna be a very
cheap but very important piece

05:51.552 --> 05:54.052
of equipment here
at base camp.

05:54.088 --> 05:56.788
I really enjoy being
frugal like my parents

05:56.824 --> 05:59.725
taught me to be.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.528
To be able to take something
that is essentially trash,

06:05.232 --> 06:08.867
that I can turn into
a very useful tool.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.070
This little thing,
at 500 bucks,

06:12.106 --> 06:14.072
it could catch on fire
tomorrow and I really wouldn't

06:14.108 --> 06:17.142
care all that much.

06:17.177 --> 06:21.513
Whereas if you had a
$9,000-$10,000 side by side,

06:21.548 --> 06:24.850
the continued payments on
that, it won't go away.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.652
And so you gotta be frugal
and be mindful about what I'm

06:27.688 --> 06:30.222
spending money on out here.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.858
And that's the only
way to survive.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.695
Won't be needing these.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.831
All right.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.000
That should be the last of it.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.269
Look at this truck bed space!

06:44.304 --> 06:46.805
I could stack
firewood way up here,

06:46.840 --> 06:50.842
just great big towering piles
of firewood weaving in and out

06:50.878 --> 06:53.178
of the woods with this
thing on my property because

06:53.213 --> 06:54.946
it's so tiny.

06:54.982 --> 07:00.852
And then this got cut off and
just turned into a tailgate.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.991
So, a cheap-o SUV
has now become a lawn

07:06.026 --> 07:07.659
and garden tractor.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.796
It can haul firewood
and train dog teams.

07:10.831 --> 07:11.930
Work's done.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.534
I'm gonna go grab some dogs
and test this beast out.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.141
ALEX: I don't have
a lot of money,

07:23.177 --> 07:25.444
but the land around
me is my wealth.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.513
You know, in the same
way a person takes care
of their bank account,

07:28.549 --> 07:30.682
I have to take care
of my bank account.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.451
I think it's just that simple.

07:35.756 --> 07:39.524
(chopping)

07:42.663 --> 07:44.629
ALEX: Every time I
cut down a tree here,

07:44.665 --> 07:48.567
I get more firewood, but if
I leave all these branches,

07:48.602 --> 07:50.969
it's just more fuel on the
ground for a forest fire.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.606
So, I gotta clean
it up every time.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.676
And keep creating big brush
piles, and then I'll burn 'em.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.778
The works never done,
but that's good,

07:59.813 --> 08:01.413
because I like doing the work.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.183
It's not really
a question of if,

08:05.219 --> 08:07.486
but it's just a
question of when.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.023
The greatest threat that
I face is not bears,

08:12.059 --> 08:13.425
not the cold either.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.427
It's actually a forest fire.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.828
Less than ten years ago,

08:16.864 --> 08:19.531
there was a huge forest fire
that destroyed many thousands

08:19.566 --> 08:21.967
of acres just about
a mile from here.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.603
And firefighters
were able to stop it.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.472
It would be almost impossible
for them to save my place,

08:27.508 --> 08:29.074
because there's all this
brush and stuff all over

08:29.109 --> 08:31.109
the ground surrounding it.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.911
So, a few months ago
before the ground froze,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.212
I dug a big hole right here,

08:34.281 --> 08:36.615
and then I covered
it with plywood.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.216
If I don't take care of this,

08:38.252 --> 08:42.721
all of this fuel
around my cabin,

08:45.859 --> 08:48.693
it could be the difference
between losing my home

08:48.729 --> 08:50.128
or saving my home.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.198
So, in order to protect
my property and my life,

08:53.233 --> 08:56.801
I have to literally
fight fire with fire.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.705
Okay, so this is
my big burn pit.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.441
What I'm gonna need to do
is collect all of my fuel,

09:03.477 --> 09:05.076
you know, just lots
of brush like this.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.279
I'll pile it all right here.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.814
Then I'll get my fire going,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.883
and then I just gotta
keep feeding it in.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.285
It's gonna be a lot of work.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.320
Once I get it built up,
it's gonna be a lot of fun.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.455
So, I'm going to get started.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.991
The biggest fuel loads around
my cabin are actually some

09:20.027 --> 09:21.726
brush piles that I've made.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.129
And these are basically
just like giant bombs.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.432
If it catches these on fire,
it's just gonna be a huge,

09:27.467 --> 09:30.669
you know, tower of fire that
will burn extremely hot.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.138
It'd be really irresponsible
of me to just sit here and

09:33.173 --> 09:34.973
keep my fingers
crossed that a forest fire

09:35.008 --> 09:36.074
doesn't come through.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.276
So, this is bush
style adulting.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.646
If I make a mess,
I gotta clean it up.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.587
But yeah, it's a lot of work.

09:48.622 --> 09:51.056
But it's the kinda
work I like to do.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.692
I like, I work,
I like working with my body.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.393
There's not really any
jobs left that are, like,

09:55.429 --> 09:57.028
just doing physical
work, you know.

09:57.064 --> 10:00.765
Everything's some big machine.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.101
Sitting around on your butt.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.873
So, I still got
more to do here.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.141
This is one pile.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.476
I got three more.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.579
There's a lot more to
collect, so I'll keep at it.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.720
JOHNNY: You know, with beauty,
comes the beast.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.422
With the beauty of
the landscape, the snow,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.391
the ice crystals
forming on everything,

10:26.426 --> 10:28.760
comes the cold
and bitter chills.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.464
So, yeah, it's a very
extreme place to live in.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.304
JOHNNY: It's a
brisk one today.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.773
It's a very primal
existence out here.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.441
I do as much
foraging, gathering,

10:43.477 --> 10:45.443
and hunting as I can.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.113
I have to constantly be
chopping firewood and I have

10:48.148 --> 10:50.949
to haul water from the lake.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.120
I don't have running water,
but I have walking water.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.989
A lot of people say, "How do
you keep up with all those

10:58.025 --> 10:59.724
challenges in one day?"

10:59.760 --> 11:01.326
But I welcome them.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.028
To me, it's more of
an inspiration than

11:03.063 --> 11:05.397
it is challenge.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.002
Can't always expect nature
to provide everything I

11:11.038 --> 11:12.637
want when I want it.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.674
It's not that
convenient out here.

11:16.610 --> 11:21.312
Last thing I need to do is
work up a sweat out here.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.749
And nature decides
when I get what I want.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.286
It's close to negative 20
down here in the lake.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.558
So, I'm chopping a hole
in the ice to fill up

11:33.593 --> 11:36.227
my water bucket.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.363
It's something you
gotta do every day.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.532
Chop through the
new formed ice.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.701
Lakes make a lot of noise.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.803
It sounds like
thunder cracking.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.639
It's almost like you're
sitting above a bowling alley.

11:50.377 --> 11:56.014
(ice cracking and shifting)

11:56.049 --> 11:59.751
You could feel that ice
shift right underneath me.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.686
You just hear it
shoot across the lake.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.921
Crack under your feet.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.323
And it kinda went right through
my water hole right here.

12:05.358 --> 12:09.894
(ice cracking and shifting)

12:20.273 --> 12:21.339
JOHNNY: (bleep).

12:21.374 --> 12:22.941
You can hear the ice settling.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.343
So, the water freezes
underneath and the ice falls

12:25.378 --> 12:28.446
down to that new water level.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.952
It's safe.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.787
I'm not, I'm not scared
of death out here.

12:35.822 --> 12:37.055
I'm not scared of danger.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.424
And if I was,
I don't belong out here.

12:42.496 --> 12:43.928
Ice is getting pretty thick.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.865
It's hard to get a clean
hole and just chop it with

12:46.900 --> 12:50.368
the axe without
getting too wet.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.970
And the bucket,
I can't really fit in that

12:52.005 --> 12:53.505
little hole anymore.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.773
As I get closer to winter,

12:54.808 --> 12:57.776
I'm learning
how prepared I am.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.843
You know, in some areas,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.812
I think I'm more
prepared than others.

13:00.847 --> 13:03.314
But as the
challenges face me,

13:03.350 --> 13:05.383
I have to adapt quickly.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.919
It's all about
adaptation out here.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.622
Today, I'm gonna
make an upgrade.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.024
The ice is getting thick
enough to where I need to

13:13.059 --> 13:15.393
upgrade with some new tools.

13:16.163 --> 13:21.432
I'm gonna make an ice
chisel and some ice cleats
for my boots because it's,

13:21.468 --> 13:25.170
it gets slippery out here,
walking around on the ice.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.307
Pretty soon, I'm gonna
get a lot of snow,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.176
so I'm gonna make
a snow shovel.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.345
Might even make a little ice
scooper to get the ice out,

13:34.815 --> 13:36.047
so I don't have to
keep putting gloves on and

13:36.082 --> 13:37.348
stick my hands in the water.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.485
You know, the cold penetrates
those gloves pretty easily.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.688
There's not a
hardware store I can
just pop into and buy this.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.157
I'm 200 miles away from
the nearest town and I

13:46.193 --> 13:48.092
gotta make it myself.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.494
Running around in the woods,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.930
I can find
some resources to use.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.465
It shouldn't be a problem
to make some tools.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.068
Seasons change and
they change fast.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.636
It's not a gradual change.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.605
It happens almost overnight.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.740
So being prepared,
having the right tools,

14:02.776 --> 14:06.311
is the key to
success out here.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.722
ALEX: For me, using my
body isn't hard work.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.858
It's just what
I do, it's life.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.593
Sitting inside an office,
sitting in front of a

14:21.628 --> 14:24.696
computer, and doing
paperwork, that's hard work.

14:24.731 --> 14:25.997
I hate to do it.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.365
It feels terrible to do it.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.533
Everything in my body says,

14:28.568 --> 14:30.768
"No, no, no.
Don't do this."

14:39.880 --> 14:41.179
ALEX: I've been doing
a lot of work to clear all the

14:41.214 --> 14:42.647
land around my cabin.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.782
But now this tree is
just sitting here.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.718
I'll cut it up and
turn it into firewood.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.553
But all these branches,
that's not good firewood.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.588
So, what I, what I'll do is
just cut these branches off

14:50.624 --> 14:52.724
and I can add them
to my big burn pit.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.465
If all I do is respond
to immediate needs,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.700
just like things that are
right in front of my face,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.202
obvious dangers.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.371
Well then, I'm just
barely surviving.

15:06.406 --> 15:10.008
If I'm predicting things that
could happen and I mitigate

15:10.043 --> 15:12.510
them now, then I'm thriving.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.313
Then I'm a real
bush man genius, so.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.954
I gotta think ahead.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.859
It would be a real shame if I
struggle an entire winter and

15:27.894 --> 15:30.628
then a forest fire destroys
my entire home in the summer.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.965
So that's a pretty
good wood pile.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.035
I think I'll burn it.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.807
The way I build a fire is
just kinda<i> Lincoln Logs,</i>

15:44.077 --> 15:46.377
stack them up like this, it's
just kind of with air flowing

15:46.813 --> 15:48.379
in there decently.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.714
You know, I'm playing
with fire here.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.317
I'm playing with
extremely high heat.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.888
So, one of the major things
that I just gotta be careful

15:56.923 --> 15:58.256
of while I'm doing this is,

15:58.291 --> 16:00.391
I'm gonna be standing
near the fire throwing

16:00.427 --> 16:02.660
additional pieces of wood in.

16:02.696 --> 16:05.463
I just gotta be careful not
to fall in and burn myself,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.098
melt any of my clothing.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.233
Because there is a
real danger here.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.173
The more stuff
I throw on top,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.408
the bigger it's gonna get.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.217
Most of this forest
is stuff that would be

16:26.252 --> 16:27.852
really hard to burn.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.387
It's not really flammable.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.589
It's got a lot of
moisture in it.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.192
But what happens in
a forest fire is,

16:34.227 --> 16:37.161
once the fire gets
so big and so hot,

16:37.197 --> 16:38.663
it'll just burn anything,

16:38.698 --> 16:41.499
because all that moisture
just vaporizes very quickly,

16:41.534 --> 16:44.869
turns the wood into dry wood,
and then it will burn.

16:44.904 --> 16:48.239
So that's the
same conditions I have to
create using my burn pit.

16:48.274 --> 16:52.877
Okay, okay, it's getting
kinda warm over here.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.312
Gonna take off my jacket.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.048
I don't really feel like
I'm in Alaska anymore.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.649
It's getting pretty warm.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.585
(flames blazing)

17:01.721 --> 17:03.388
(crackle and pop)

17:04.724 --> 17:07.091
So over here, it feels
like winter in Alaska,

17:07.127 --> 17:08.226
I get pretty cold.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.895
But then when I
come over here,

17:10.930 --> 17:13.131
it feels like a
sandstorm in Kuwait.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.466
Just like blowing
fumes of hot air.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.502
Oh my God.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.007
Oh, that is (bleep) hot.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.711
That is hot.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.314
Whew, the embers
are getting me.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.250
Whew!

17:32.285 --> 17:35.787
It's burning my skin.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.626
Whew.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.463
(bleep). Oh (bleep).

17:54.941 --> 17:56.741
ALEX: Oh (bleep).

17:58.945 --> 18:01.212
Make sure I'm not burning
my clothes over here.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.049
Not melted.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.851
This stump right
here is steaming,

18:06.886 --> 18:08.953
so I just moved my clothes
so they don't melt.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.922
It's too hot to stand
right here, really.

18:15.061 --> 18:19.664
Whew. That's it.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.467
That's all my wood.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.968
Eventually, the
middle will all burn,

18:24.003 --> 18:25.503
and then I can
shove the sides in.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.639
But for now, I can just
sit back and enjoy it.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.643
Took me a couple days
to gather all this wood.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.613
Now, I've basically burned
it off in just a matter of a

18:35.648 --> 18:37.348
couple of hours.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.518
Really makes me realize the
destructive power of a fire.

18:40.553 --> 18:43.488
It gives me life, and yet,
it can take away everything,

18:43.523 --> 18:45.356
too, in a moment.

18:45.391 --> 18:47.458
That's real power.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.961
I don't think I'm quite as
high as my cabin yet, but oh,

18:49.996 --> 18:52.363
it's pretty good.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.098
That's pretty tall.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.467
When I was younger, whenever
someone pressed me, you know,

18:56.503 --> 18:57.702
"What are you gonna
do with your life?"

18:57.737 --> 18:59.103
"Why don't you do
better in school?"

18:59.139 --> 19:00.738
I'd always tell them,
"I wanna be a caveman.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.507
I don't care about
any of that stuff."

19:02.542 --> 19:04.876
But I never really thought
that I was actually gonna

19:04.911 --> 19:07.445
grow up and kinda
become a caveman.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.781
And from here, I only wanna
become more of a caveman.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.154
Whew.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.489
Well, it's quitting
time for the day.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.258
I'm pretty exhausted.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.394
But there was a purpose,
and to be honest,

19:23.429 --> 19:24.962
even if there was
no purpose to this,

19:24.998 --> 19:27.865
I might have done it
anyway, because why not?

19:31.037 --> 19:34.472
When your work is also what
you might do for fun anyways,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.941
that's as good as
it gets, I think.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.882
JOHNNY: To know what
I need out here,

19:44.918 --> 19:47.952
I gotta spend time in nature.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.888
And ultimately, nature
tells me what I need.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.792
It's all about
banding with nature.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.727
It's being part of it.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.631
JOHNNY: First thing I'm
gonna make is an ice chisel.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.834
It's gonna be a chisel that
I can more efficiently chop a

20:03.870 --> 20:05.303
hole through the ice.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.071
To get water and, you know,

20:07.106 --> 20:10.074
even to go ice fishing
once it's time to do that.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.384
Well, it's frozen, so I
hope it will close tight.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.653
Probably not.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.889
We will figure it out.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.858
You know, to prepare for the
changing of seasons out here,

20:27.894 --> 20:29.193
you need to adapt.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.762
And to adapt for winter,
I need to make some tools.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.065
Simple tools that I
can kind of put up my

20:34.100 --> 20:36.167
own fight against nature.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.802
So, I need to make an
ice chisel to clear out an

20:37.837 --> 20:40.471
ice hole to get my water.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.506
I have an old chisel that
I'm gonna secure it down

20:42.542 --> 20:44.008
with some cordage.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.877
All right, one last
knot right here.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.780
Boom. I have my ice pick.

20:49.983 --> 20:50.948
Cool.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.084
Now I just gotta
give it a test run.

20:53.286 --> 20:56.120
Ice pick is an essential
tool in the Arctic.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.823
An axe, the
handle's too short.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.992
And eventually, this ice
will be several feet thick.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.693
I won't be able to chop
all the way down to get

21:02.729 --> 21:04.762
to the water.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.131
So the ice pick is a
super vital tool out here

21:07.166 --> 21:08.733
in the Arctic.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.867
Awesome.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.470
I think the next thing to
make is gonna be a scooper

21:12.505 --> 21:15.406
to scoop all of the ice
chunks out of the hole.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.009
And first thing I'll
need is a willow branch,

21:18.044 --> 21:20.111
because willow is
very malleable.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.114
So, that'll be
the choice wood.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.849
So, to make the ice scooper,

21:24.884 --> 21:26.250
I'm gonna use this willow,

21:26.286 --> 21:29.020
bottom of a kerosene can that
I have, and some cordage.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.555
It's pretty simple,
tie it all together,

21:31.591 --> 21:33.324
and that'll complete
the ice scooper.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.493
It'll filter out the water
and the ice when I try

21:35.528 --> 21:38.529
to clean out my ice hole.

21:39.198 --> 21:41.632
Don't be an ice hole, dude.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.502
Yeah, it's easy to
keep it simple out here

21:44.537 --> 21:46.704
with these tools.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.739
The simple items that I
find laying around and the

21:48.775 --> 21:50.875
natural resources around me,

21:50.910 --> 21:52.343
oh yeah,
we're getting somewhere with

21:52.378 --> 21:54.245
this bad boy.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.248
I can pretty much make
any tool that I need.

21:57.717 --> 21:58.716
Cool.

21:58.751 --> 21:59.850
Yeah, it's rustic looking.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.218
You know, it's got
a patina to it.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.421
But to me, you know,
that's beauty.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.090
That's, I like
this kind of stuff.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.526
I like character.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.895
I'm giving it a
little test run.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.765
Oh yeah.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.067
Works great.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.769
You know, it's important to
repurpose all of the material

22:18.805 --> 22:21.238
I have around here
because just that...

22:21.274 --> 22:24.141
its all I have out here.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.877
What I have here
is what I have.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.480
So, I gotta utilize the
materials that I have on hand

22:29.515 --> 22:32.149
to make the items that I need.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.420
It's a good way to
separate what you want versus

22:36.456 --> 22:37.888
what you need.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.257
Awesome.
I'm pretty happy with that.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.159
The sun's going down.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.363
It's time to get
off this cold ice.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.569
JESSI: Huge part of living
in Alaska is being able

22:51.604 --> 22:54.004
to adapt to your circumstances
and your surroundings.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.241
You gotta survive the winter.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.978
You gotta decide that
your life's worth it, right?

23:02.014 --> 23:03.881
(chainsaw motor)

23:09.622 --> 23:11.122
That's a lot of bows, love.

23:11.157 --> 23:12.656
CHRIS: Oh, I just figured
I'd cut it all up.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.759
You can use what you want.

23:16.963 --> 23:20.498
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>Chris and Jessi Morse are</i>
<i>attempting to trap beaver,</i>

23:20.533 --> 23:23.567

23:24.937 --> 23:28.239

23:31.177 --> 23:33.744
<i>they must be</i>
<i>extremely careful when</i>
<i>setting their traps.</i>

23:35.782 --> 23:37.281
JESSI: I was just
trying to think of where

23:37.350 --> 23:38.849
we were gonna set.

23:38.885 --> 23:40.518
Like I wish I could
get on the river.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.953
CHRIS: It's deep
overflow out here, like.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.124
JESSI: Ooh, yeah.
Look how wet that is.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.027
Okay.
So, we gotta stay close.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.530
CHRIS: Right in here,
you drop some in here,

23:52.565 --> 23:54.732
I bet you're gonna
get something.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.068
JESSI: So, you think that
that is a good spot to snare,

23:58.104 --> 23:59.036
right there?

23:59.071 --> 24:01.071
CHRIS: I can see
underneath the ice a bunch

24:01.107 --> 24:02.273
of beaver signs.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.674
Do you see all this
funky ice right here?

24:03.709 --> 24:04.975
It's got chunks in it.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.811
JESSI:
That's snacking material.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.078
So, I mean, this is it.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.014
This is the only spot
that we can put it.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.016
CHRIS: Can you hand
me the chainsaw, love?

24:21.928 --> 24:26.230
(chainsaw motor)

24:35.975 --> 24:38.742
(chainsaw motor)

24:41.414 --> 24:44.181
Something down there.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.317
I'm not sure what's going on.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.586
Something's weird.
I'm gonna try and pry at this.

24:48.621 --> 24:49.520
JESSI: Okay.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.089
CHRIS: Swap me
out with the axe.

24:53.759 --> 24:54.892
Weird.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.527
JESSI: I'm expecting some
three headed beaver to come

24:56.562 --> 24:58.362
out of here or something.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.374
CHRIS: Weird.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.209
JESSI: Is that the ground?

25:12.245 --> 25:14.111
CHRIS: I don't know
what's down there.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.213
JESSI: What is that?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.859
JESSI: Dang!
This stinks, love.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.394
CHRIS: I'm already
this far in.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.463
I gotta get down there and
just at least scope it out.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.931
JESSI: I don't know if
he's cutting through bank,

25:33.966 --> 25:35.799
or if he's cutting
through trash feed,

25:35.835 --> 25:38.602
if he's cutting
through the feed pile.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.739
But, just lots of,
like, eaten branches.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.409
Wow!

25:45.444 --> 25:47.545
It's like the beaver trash.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.014
So, they're just like super
messy adolescent beavers.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.682
CHRIS:
That's what I'm thinking.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.551
(bleep) adolescents!

25:53.586 --> 25:54.785
JESSI: Oh my.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.521
CHRIS: it's the entrance into
the den I bet, right there.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.989
That's why it's bubblin' out.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.391
JESSI: So, you like,
smashed a hole right above

26:00.426 --> 26:01.358
their door jam.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.226
CHRIS: Uh-hmm.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.360
JESSI: This is
just a weird one.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.963
This might be kind of a
trial and error kinda thing.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.331
CHRIS: We're gonna
find somethin' out.

26:07.366 --> 26:11.135
I think we should put a
snare, like, right in here,

26:11.170 --> 26:12.736
one right in this corner,
and one right in this

26:12.772 --> 26:15.739
corner nice and deep.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.474
JESSI: All right, you
wanna place this guy?

26:17.510 --> 26:19.677
CHRIS: Yeah.
Let's make sure it.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.544
JESSI: I'm happy.

26:20.580 --> 26:27.251
CHRIS: Yeah. There it goes.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.892
JESSI: I have to
be really careful about
where I set the snares.

26:34.927 --> 26:35.892
They're just finicky.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.328
They're just finicky
little snares.

26:37.363 --> 26:41.165
They have to be twisted
just right, faced just right.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.734
I don't wanna walk away
from a set that I'm not 100%

26:43.769 --> 26:45.069
dedicated to.

26:45.104 --> 26:48.405
I want every snare to be
at its maximum potential.

26:48.441 --> 26:52.543
So that set is at its maximum
potential to get a beaver.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.445
All right, right in
the middle, right?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.879
CHRIS: Uh-hmm.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.015
JESSI: Okay, please
don't drop snare.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.417
Please don't drop, snare.

27:00.653 --> 27:04.121
So, I really need the snares
to be in the exact spots.

27:04.156 --> 27:07.124
I spend a lot of time
on my hands, and knees,

27:07.159 --> 27:08.892
with my eyes really,
really close to that hole,

27:08.928 --> 27:11.095
placing those snares.

27:11.364 --> 27:12.296
But they're perfect.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.464
I think they're good.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.733
I think they're in the
spot that we need them.

27:15.768 --> 27:16.834
That's good.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.569
CHRIS: All right.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.704
JESSI: All righty-roo!

27:20.740 --> 27:22.473
Well, like, there we go.

27:22.508 --> 27:23.807
CHRIS: I'm worried, does it...

27:23.843 --> 27:25.876
JESSI: We just gotta cover
up the hole with snow and

27:25.911 --> 27:29.613
spruce boughs and just
hope that tomorrow or the
next day when we come out,

27:29.649 --> 27:31.749
maybe we have a beaver on
the other end of the snare.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.759
JOHNNY: You know, to prepare
for living in the Arctic,

27:41.794 --> 27:43.994
in an environment like this,
you got to plan ahead.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.399
It's all about preparation
in a land like this.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.572
JOHNNY: Snow's still
haven't come yet.

27:55.608 --> 27:57.307
But they will,
and when they do come,

27:57.343 --> 27:59.309
I wanna be prepared.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.445
So, I'm making
this snow shovel.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.819
So this is part of
a 55-gallon drum.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.090
Looks like it'd make a
good shovel, so I cut it.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.826
There's no instruction
booklet for any of this stuff.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.261
There's only one way
to find out,

28:17.296 --> 28:19.596
is just to just try it.

28:21.667 --> 28:25.302
Yeah, just go anywhere
you want, saw.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.804
No matter where you live,

28:26.839 --> 28:30.040
you gotta be prepared
for that environment.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.911
So I'm just gonna cut a
couple brackets out of this.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.380
And in this environment,
it's even more crucial to be

28:36.415 --> 28:39.049
prepared because it's the
elements that you're facing.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.785
It's, it's nature,
it's very stark contrast.

28:42.288 --> 28:44.621
You're either living
or you're dying.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.957
There's not a damn
thing in between.

28:46.992 --> 28:49.860
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
We're in business.

28:52.998 --> 28:55.199
Shovel store is open.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.802
Ultimately, you can
make a living or you can

28:58.838 --> 29:01.105
buy a living.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.041
And I tried buying
my living and it
didn't work for me.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.376
To pay for
everything we need,

29:06.412 --> 29:08.011
to have people
do everything for us,

29:08.047 --> 29:09.847
I don't think
that's natural.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.548
It's all about being reliable.

29:11.584 --> 29:14.785
Do you wanna
rely on others or do you
wanna rely on yourself?

29:15.421 --> 29:16.720
It's pretty good.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.690
In a place like this,
I choose to rely on myself.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.497
This is gonna help with
my success of the winter,

29:26.532 --> 29:27.965
that's what this is gonna do.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.968
One less thing I
gotta worry about now.

29:31.003 --> 29:33.103
But, I gotta keep pushing on.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.075
MICHAEL: Cold weather
is really hard.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.377
And really, the only way
that you can keep them energy

29:40.412 --> 29:42.946
levels up is just gettin' out
and workin' in the weather.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.182
You gotta condition
yourself for.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.352
You gotta stay outside
as long as you can.

29:48.654 --> 29:51.622
You gotta let them toes get
a little cold here and there.

29:55.761 --> 30:01.799
(barking and howling)

30:06.338 --> 30:07.738
MICHAEL: All right.

30:07.773 --> 30:13.610
This thing wouldn't be complete
without a set of moose antlers.

30:13.646 --> 30:16.180
That'll be something that I
can wrap up my gang lines with

30:16.215 --> 30:18.382
when I'm not using them.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.786
And with some crazy
mayhem like this,

30:22.822 --> 30:24.555
we need some
patriotism as well.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.494
Another cool thing
about this rig,

30:30.529 --> 30:33.697
is it's got this
big bright red hook,

30:33.732 --> 30:36.200
and it's welded
right to the frame.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.435
That's a perfect spot
to hook up a gang line.

30:43.709 --> 30:47.611
I'm puttin' my four most
rambunctious, crazy,

30:47.646 --> 30:50.214
powerful malamutes
on the gang line.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.886
Haw!

30:55.921 --> 30:57.054
There's a lot of frenzied...

30:57.089 --> 30:58.222
Come here.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.591
Nervous energy pent up in
these dogs because they've

31:00.626 --> 31:01.992
been sittin' for some time.

31:02.027 --> 31:05.395
Line up!

31:07.833 --> 31:10.701
Try to keep the teams small
in the early season runs.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.502
So that way there, they're
more comfortable just working

31:12.538 --> 31:14.371
with a smaller group.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.906
Hop up! Come on.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.774
But hooking them up
to an automobile,

31:17.810 --> 31:19.810
that's entirely new for them.

31:19.845 --> 31:21.445
Come on. Gee, over.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.314
They've never ran in front
of one and had to focus on

31:24.350 --> 31:27.251
keeping that gang line tight.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.555
And so, hopefully,
this goes well.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.495
Go get 'em!

31:38.530 --> 31:41.999
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

31:42.034 --> 31:43.967
Go! Go! Go!

31:45.237 --> 31:46.703
What the (bleep)?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.283
What the (bleep)?

32:09.261 --> 32:12.162
Line up that way.
You go that way.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.432
Look, that way.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.534
'Kay?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.436
Stay.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.705
Shh! Quiet down.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.178
You ready?

32:28.213 --> 32:31.281
Go! Go get 'em!

32:34.887 --> 32:37.554
Go get 'em!
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

32:39.959 --> 32:41.858
Straight ahead.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.862
We're just gonna
go kinda slow.

32:45.898 --> 32:49.499
Let 'em get used to
runnin' down the road.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.035
All right.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.271
You know, I just have
this thing in drive,

32:54.306 --> 32:57.074
just so that I keep, keep
some forward motion going.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.342
I'm not jerkin' 'em.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.645
But they're kinda
pullin' this thing.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.181
I wanna keep a
constant weight on 'em.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.583
So I'm looking for a
really tight tug line.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.486
You don't want to let dogs
free-run in the early season

33:09.521 --> 33:11.054
because this is
about conditioning,

33:11.090 --> 33:12.756
holding them back.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.092
Hop up! Yup! Yup!

33:16.261 --> 33:18.595
And so the
gas pedal, the brakes,

33:18.630 --> 33:22.966
this all helps me keep these
dogs at a precise six and a

33:23.002 --> 33:25.969
half to seven miles an hour.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.939
Good boys!

33:28.974 --> 33:32.242
This is just a really
safe way of gettin' them first

33:32.277 --> 33:34.177
early season miles on the dogs.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.847
I'm really liking this.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.520
I could see it now.

33:43.555 --> 33:47.124
I have an entire eight-dog
team hooked up to this thing.

33:47.926 --> 33:50.360
Best 500 bucks I ever spent.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.964
They have done about a
three or four mile loop.

33:53.999 --> 33:56.099
I could tell
they're tuckered up.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.802
All right.
Do you guys like your new toy?

33:59.938 --> 34:02.506
Do you like your new toy?

34:02.541 --> 34:05.142
Good boys.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.045
They've never been hooked
up to an automobile before,

34:08.080 --> 34:09.346
and they don't seem to mind.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.947
I think that went really well.

34:10.983 --> 34:13.784
It's really special to see
these guys subjected to

34:13.819 --> 34:16.486
something new and prevail.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.522
Good boy. Good boy.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.165
CHRIS: The Cosna's always
throwing curve balls.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.333
Every year, it's
something different.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.870
I feel like everything on this
river's fighting against us.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.705
But we can't just pack up
and head back to the lake

34:35.741 --> 34:38.008
where we know
there's just nothing
there for us to trap.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.647
We gotta make it work or
we're gonna go hungry and

34:43.682 --> 34:45.449
it's gonna be a tough winter.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.688
CHRIS: Rock Solid.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.889
We're feeling good about it.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.991
We got the three snares set
exactly where I think the

34:55.027 --> 34:57.794
beavers running through and
maybe we got the beaver and

34:57.830 --> 34:59.729
it's just stuck
down under the ice.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.765
And so I won't know
until I chip it all out.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.900
But I'm hopeful.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.670
JESSI: Oop! Okay.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.405
I think that's it.

35:09.041 --> 35:10.674
BOTH: Oh!

35:10.709 --> 35:13.076
CHRIS: We had a beaver.

35:13.112 --> 35:14.744
That is disheartening.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.979
JESSI: Wow!

35:16.014 --> 35:17.581
So he must have
gotten it real tight.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.550
You know, this triggered,
and then he chewed on this

35:20.586 --> 35:21.918
to pull this thing down.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.653
You see how when I pull that,
it comes down?

35:23.689 --> 35:24.821
CHRIS: Yeah.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.423
JESSI: So, we had a beaver
for a short period of time.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.357
Yeah?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.358
That's a strong beaver.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.459
CHRIS: Yeah. I'm impressed.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.627
JESSI: That's a
super strong beaver.

35:30.662 --> 35:31.728
CHRIS: Let's check
out the other one.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.430
Maybe it got caught
in the other one.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.135
Nothin'.

35:38.170 --> 35:40.103
JESSI: Nada.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.339
CHRIS: It's like a tornado
going around in circles

35:42.374 --> 35:44.207
all around your snare.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.842
JESSI: Maybe because
it's the river?

35:45.878 --> 35:46.877
CHRIS: Yeah.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.311
So, it's just very new to me.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.214
I'm just, I've never seen
them pile sticks around

35:51.250 --> 35:52.516
snares like that.

35:52.551 --> 35:53.850
JESSI: It's.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.285
CHRIS: Very strange.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.620
Smart beavers.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.355
JESSI: New type of beaver.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.290
CHRIS: It's the
strangest thing.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.226
It's almost like they're
putting caution tape up

36:03.262 --> 36:04.895
around our snares.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.297
I've never seen beavers go
to so much lengths to block a

36:07.332 --> 36:09.466
snare with sticks like this.

36:09.501 --> 36:10.734
Damn!

36:10.769 --> 36:12.235
JESSI:
We were so close.
We were so close!

36:12.271 --> 36:14.771
CHRIS: Maybe, maybe this
other one has it in him.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.039
JESSI: Last one?

36:16.074 --> 36:17.841
CHRIS: Well, let's find out.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.677
JESSI: Wow,
that's deep, Chris.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.045
CHRIS: Okay.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.814
Let me see if I can
find your snare.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.384
Jessi is very meticulous
on where she puts 'em.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.952
We spent the time,
we put 'em in right.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.887
Why aren't we
gettin' any beaver?

36:30.923 --> 36:32.956
Oop. Look at that.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.992
JESSI: They ate the bait pole.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.861
CHRIS: I think I'm gonna have
to go down to my T-shirt,

36:37.896 --> 36:39.896
stick my arm down in there.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.364
JESSI: Okay.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.233
CHRIS: Okay.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.239
There's somethin' fuzzy
down in there.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.341
JESSI: No way.
CHRIS: Yeah.
JESSI: No. Stop it.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.176
CHRIS: It's wrapped
up in sticks.

36:53.212 --> 36:55.378
Holy cow!
This thing is heavy.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.080
Oh! I almost got it.
Almost got it.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.215
JESSI: Do you really?

36:58.250 --> 36:59.616
Are you serious?
Are you serious?

36:59.651 --> 37:01.051
CHRIS: Yeah.
JESSI: Let me see.

37:01.086 --> 37:02.285
CHRIS: I'm trying right now.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.520
JESSI: Let me see.
No way!

37:03.555 --> 37:04.788
CHRIS: It's (bleep) massive!

37:04.823 --> 37:07.524
JESSI: No way!
CHRIS: I got it!
JESSI: Holy cow!

37:15.400 --> 37:17.701
CHRIS: It's (bleep) massive!
JESSI: No way!

37:17.736 --> 37:19.069
CHRIS: I'm trying
to find an end of it.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.737
I got it.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.505
JESSI: Stop.
CHRIS: I got it.
(bleep) massive!

37:22.541 --> 37:23.540
JESSI: Holy cow!

37:23.575 --> 37:25.242
CHRIS: It's (bleep) huge!

37:25.277 --> 37:27.177
JESSI: Holy Smokes!

37:27.212 --> 37:29.512
There is a beaver on
the end of the snare.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.147
Like, we did it.

37:31.183 --> 37:32.882
We got a beaver!

37:34.253 --> 37:35.819
Holy smokes!

37:35.854 --> 37:37.887
This is a huge,
monster beaver.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.024
We have succeeded in this
really difficult deep river.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.126
And I've never done this
type of set, but, like,

37:43.161 --> 37:45.295
it paid off.

37:45.330 --> 37:46.963
CHRIS: That's a
good looking beav.

37:46.999 --> 37:48.265
JESSI: That's a big beaver.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.133
It's a huge beaver.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.534
After all that work.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.769
And in the river.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.505
Like, the first time in the
stinking river and we did it.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.040
Oh my goodness.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.041
CHRIS: Good job.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.643
JESSI: Oh, my goodness!

37:59.678 --> 38:01.311
CHRIS: Well, let's
get it dried off,

38:01.346 --> 38:04.281
and then we have a long
ways to drag this guy home.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.016
JESSI: Thank you
for your life, beaver.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.551
Nothing will go unused.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.986
We appreciate you and
we appreciate your life.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.857
Take it home!

38:14.259 --> 38:16.459
CHRIS: Oh! He's huge.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.295
I'm pretty excited.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.896
All of our hard work
is finally paying off.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.798
Everything's finally
coming into focus.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.334
The Cosna just likes to push
us to the edge of breaking.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.970
And it just goes to show
that you just can't give up.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.005
You just gotta keep moving
forward and keep pushing and

38:29.041 --> 38:31.741
the Cosna will reward you.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.888
ALEX: I've begun this big
journey towards clearing my

38:44.923 --> 38:47.657
cabin to make it safer
from a forest fire.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.797
But on any big journey,
you know, my experience has

38:53.832 --> 38:56.733
taught me
that the best thing to
do is to enjoy the work.

38:56.768 --> 38:57.867
Because if I enjoy the work,

38:57.903 --> 38:59.469
and then I'll
keep doing it,

38:59.504 --> 39:01.004
and then one day,
it'll be finished.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.640
So, the ritual's complete.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.476
It's to be the first of many.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.645
So, this is only
the beginning.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.883
It's gonna take me a long
time of doing this many,

39:13.919 --> 39:15.919
many times before the
mission's complete.

39:17.255 --> 39:20.123
So this will have to
become a habit for me.

39:20.158 --> 39:22.292
Okay. It's just the door.

39:23.895 --> 39:26.129
When you live
further from society,

39:26.164 --> 39:27.997
you gotta do more
things on your own.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.799
I mean, that's just
kinda how it is.

39:29.835 --> 39:33.203
If I wanna get help, I
gotta first help myself.

39:34.005 --> 39:39.042
This will just help kill
the coals more quickly.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.511
Keep fresh oxygen from
getting in so easily.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.715
And help keep any,

39:45.751 --> 39:48.685
anybody or anything
from falling in.

39:49.187 --> 39:52.088
There we go.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.224
Well, that's that.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.826
For now, I'm not safe
from a forest fire,

39:56.862 --> 39:59.295
but I'm a little bit closer.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.665
MICHAEL: This little micro
four-wheel drive used to haul

40:02.701 --> 40:04.701
a girl to college every day.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.971
But now, it's got a whole new
life out here at basecamp.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.975
It's got all sorts of utility.

40:12.010 --> 40:14.844
And just like everything else
I own, it's multifaceted.

40:15.981 --> 40:17.947
So this is just the
beginning for this thing.

40:25.724 --> 40:28.425
This is the funnest
$500 I've ever spent.

40:28.460 --> 40:33.096
This thing's all about
freedom, America, donuts,

40:33.131 --> 40:34.864
and some malamutes.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.101
Oh (bleep).

40:39.037 --> 40:40.370
That type of freedom,

40:40.405 --> 40:43.773
to be able to take something
that is essentially trash,

40:43.809 --> 40:46.743
and turn into
a very useful tool.

40:46.778 --> 40:51.681
Everything around
my life is designed to be
sustainable and affordable.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.892
JESSI: All right. Beaver.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.395
I finally got the monster
beaver that we were after.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.600
Living out at the Cosna
brings sort of respect to

41:10.635 --> 41:12.268
everything around you.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.937
It brings respect
to the river,

41:13.972 --> 41:16.139
and to the trees
that heat you,

41:16.174 --> 41:17.841
and to the animals
that feed you.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.610
These beavers are tough.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.713
This is an amazing
experience for us and nothing

41:23.748 --> 41:25.582
will go to waste.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.284
CHRIS: Oh, wow!

41:28.320 --> 41:30.453
JESSI: Holy cow!

41:30.489 --> 41:32.555
CHRIS: Has a really
good-looking haunch there.

41:33.258 --> 41:34.290
JESSI: That's awesome.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.660
Like, just this is,
just this is at least three

41:37.696 --> 41:38.928
meals for us.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.363
CHRIS: And look
how fatty it is.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.799
You can see it glisten
across there from the fat.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.135
Beaver's one of our
favorite meats out here.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.403
It's a nice fatty meat.

41:47.439 --> 41:49.038
Man, it packs some power.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.140
When we wake up and we look
over at that thermometer and

41:51.176 --> 41:53.610
it's needled out below
fifty, below zero,

41:53.645 --> 41:56.179
those are the days
we eat beaver meat.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.548
JESSI: To a good
trapping season, yeah?

41:58.583 --> 42:00.483
CHRIS: Yeah.
JESSI: First one.

42:01.386 --> 42:03.319
(crunching)

42:03.989 --> 42:06.990
CHRIS: Mmm!
Excellent. That's good.

42:07.526 --> 42:08.791
JESSI: That's rich meat.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.426
CHRIS: It's very rich.

42:10.462 --> 42:11.694
Thank you, beaver.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.963
JESSI: Thanks, beaver.

42:14.499 --> 42:15.865
CHRIS: Mm.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.204
JOHNNY: To have a
thought and to apply it,

42:21.239 --> 42:22.906
and actually build
it, to use it,

42:22.941 --> 42:24.707
and to see that it's
functional, is very,

42:24.743 --> 42:26.376
very satisfying.

42:26.411 --> 42:29.779
So, this is a chainsaw chain.

42:31.049 --> 42:34.484
And when I was putting my
window in, I hit a spike.

42:37.989 --> 42:39.722
Oh God!

42:39.758 --> 42:41.157
(bleep).

42:41.192 --> 42:42.892
That's why you gotta
wear eye protection.

42:42.928 --> 42:45.094
My mom's probably pretty
upset with me at this point.

42:46.298 --> 42:48.498
It's just too damaged.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.300
So find another use for it.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.235
And that's what I do out here.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.736
Take something that's
damaged and I turn it

42:53.772 --> 42:55.705
into something new.

42:55.740 --> 42:59.108
So, I think this chainsaw
will act as a nice ice cleat

42:59.377 --> 43:01.878
if I could strap it
to the bottom of my boot.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.113
The ice cleats are gonna
be pretty vital for me out

43:04.149 --> 43:07.283
here walking
around on slippery ice.

43:07.319 --> 43:10.253
So, I have an old chainsaw
chain laying around,

43:10.689 --> 43:13.623
so I'm gonna utilize
that for some cleats.

43:14.659 --> 43:16.492
I like to keep it
simple out here.

43:16.528 --> 43:19.696
I need something that works
and I need it to be available.

43:19.731 --> 43:20.964
And not only that,

43:20.999 --> 43:24.133
I need it to
be made from materials
I have around my camp.

43:24.369 --> 43:25.602
There it is.

43:25.637 --> 43:28.905
That's all four of 'em,
all tied on.

43:30.508 --> 43:32.141
Yeah, they feel pretty good.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.611
A lot of people see a frozen
landscape and they think

43:34.646 --> 43:36.045
"Time to go inside",

43:36.081 --> 43:38.648
but for me,
it's time to go outside.

43:38.683 --> 43:40.083
I don't wanna sit
inside and watch it.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.418
I wanna get out there
and experience it.

43:42.921 --> 43:45.121
What you doing, girl, huh?

43:45.156 --> 43:47.156
What you doing, girl?

43:47.192 --> 43:49.192
What you doing, huh?

43:49.227 --> 43:51.794
Come on, come on, come on.

43:52.564 --> 43:55.131
Mother Nature brings out the
vulnerability in me out here.

43:56.001 --> 43:57.867
And it's just when I
think I have a grip of things,

43:57.902 --> 43:59.636
she switches gears.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.904
And it's up to me
to either adapt or to

44:01.940 --> 44:03.339
face the consequences.

44:05.644 --> 44:09.078
And it's all about
adaptation and preparation.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.481
If you can harness
those simple principles,

44:11.516 --> 44:14.183
that's what's gonna keep
you coming home every night.

44:14.219 --> 44:16.486
That's what's gonna
keep you safe.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.188
That's what's gonna
keep you living wild.
