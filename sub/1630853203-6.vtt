WEBVTT

00:08.704 --> 00:10.358
Previously on "61st Street"...Plea deal at the eleventh hour.

00:10.488 --> 00:11.968
20 years
for murder one.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.404
How do you plead?Not guilty.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.102
Moses was up there
when the cop took his shot.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.842
Cop aimed up,
like this.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.061
I hear you're
Brannigan's new boy.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.889
Nation has an offer.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
We can go 5 points
better than the Faction.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.414
I'm not telling David
that you're dying.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.503
That's up to you. You do that.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.983
Her boy was a snitch,

00:27.114 --> 00:29.029
but she keeps making
a big noise about this...

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
I don't know.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.032
Want to know
who tried to kill you?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.511
Guards working
with the Faction.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.557
You don't show the world you
got our protection,

00:35.687 --> 00:36.949
you're dead.

00:40.083 --> 00:46.394
No, I don't want
any part of this, man.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.700
You know what I hate
about this country?

00:48.831 --> 00:53.140
Drummed into every child --
if you don't have a dream,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.533
you're not American.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.535
Biggest lie in history --

00:57.666 --> 01:01.583
anyone can make it if they
only dare to dream.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.063
Hm?

01:03.193 --> 01:05.413
Your wise-ass lawyer's
selling you

01:05.543 --> 01:07.937
something worse
than dreams -- hope.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.156
My lawyer's doing his job.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.374
Your lawyer's selling.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.854
I'm giving you truth.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.290
But your ass so high up
on your shoulders

01:13.421 --> 01:15.423
that you can't see
which is which,

01:15.553 --> 01:16.598
but that's all gon'
change today.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.034
What the hell
that supposed to mean?

01:19.731 --> 01:22.778
It mean forget about
the Olympic Games.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.432
Faction trying to put you
six feet under,

01:24.562 --> 01:27.130
and you still dreaming.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.784
Time to wake up.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.658
There's a package coming.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.139
Second yard session.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.010
You gon' handle it.

01:40.622 --> 01:42.841
Protection gotta be earned,
boy.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.551
Domino player:
Yo. You Speak's boy?

01:59.771 --> 02:02.296
We got the same lawyer.What, you got Franklin?

02:02.426 --> 02:05.473
Did I get him?
More like he got me.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.083
What you talkin' about,
bro?

02:07.214 --> 02:10.130
Dude got me 30 months
for stealing baby formula,

02:10.260 --> 02:12.523
all 'cause he pissed
off the judge.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.656
Bottom line
with that guy --

02:14.786 --> 02:16.919
it's all about him
and not about us.

02:17.049 --> 02:18.529
If he's handling
your case,

02:18.660 --> 02:20.705
you better get comfortable
in here.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.804
Hey.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.157
You look different.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.071
Probably the haircut,
you know?

02:40.421 --> 02:42.336
Hey, you know,
Angelo's not in here,

02:42.466 --> 02:43.685
lookin' after me
with the vitamins

02:43.815 --> 02:45.817
and everything, so...

02:49.256 --> 02:51.171
You be strong in here...

02:53.869 --> 02:57.002
alright?
You know who you are.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.569
You know who
you gonna be.

03:01.442 --> 03:03.095
Don't let this place
and no one else

03:03.226 --> 03:06.360
tell you any different.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.189
You hear me?

03:09.319 --> 03:12.148
Moses, you hear me?

03:16.239 --> 03:17.719
Say it.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.508
I heard you, Mom.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.485
Countin' on you.

04:38.669 --> 04:39.844
Moses is
state champion?

04:39.975 --> 04:41.019
Yeah.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.673
Not bad for a kid
who was born

04:42.804 --> 04:44.806
with his feet
turned inward.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.329
Why you mean?

04:46.460 --> 04:49.419
He wore braces on both his legs
for a year and a half

04:49.550 --> 04:52.379
from the age of 3
to correct it.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.598
People said he might never
walk properly,

04:54.729 --> 04:58.776
and 14 years later,
state championship.

05:01.649 --> 05:04.173
Yeah.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.393
Nobody could touch him.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.220
He'll be that again.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.100
Pick out a record.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.623
Anything you want.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.608
I don't know nothing!

05:47.738 --> 05:49.044
Then tell me something
I want to hear then.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.350
I don't know anything!

05:50.480 --> 05:51.481
Tell me something
I want to hear.

05:51.612 --> 05:52.961
Talk.
All you gotta do is talk.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.805
Yeah, there's something
you need to know about me.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.373
Okay.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.852
No, it's a big deal.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.510
Okay.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.382
I mean, you don't
have to --

06:22.512 --> 06:24.122
No, I do.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.649
I have terrible taste
in music.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.390
W-Whatever.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.956
You --

06:32.087 --> 06:33.741
I really thought
you were gonna --

06:33.871 --> 06:34.959
Okay.
Hmm.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.352
I mean, how bad?
Give it to me.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.745
Stylistics.
Oh.

06:37.875 --> 06:42.271
Yep. I'm forever
frozen in 1975.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.795
Were you even born then?
Ha!

06:44.926 --> 06:46.536
Uh, it was music
my mama played

06:46.667 --> 06:48.408
when I was,
you know, small.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.061
Mm.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.846
You blame your mama now.
So it's your mama's fault?

06:51.976 --> 06:54.588
She died when I was six.

06:56.764 --> 06:57.852
Oh, you know, I'm sorry.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.028
It's cool.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.988
You know, I feel good
about this.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.730
Aww.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.166
Do you?

07:08.297 --> 07:11.256
Moses is gonna be okay.

07:14.564 --> 07:15.652
Shit.
Oh, it's cool.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.698
Uh, you got a fuse box?

07:17.828 --> 07:21.441
Uh --
Uh, it's in the back.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.791
Shit.
I know I paid the minimum.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.097
It's cool.
Uh, you got candles?

07:26.228 --> 07:28.143
Yeah, under the sink
in the kitchen.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.101
Alright.
I'm so sorry.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.668
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
We're good.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.409
Hey.
We're good.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.677
Hey.
Hey, hey.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.026
Hey.
Whoa, whoa.

07:42.157 --> 07:43.375
Hey. Hey.
It's cool.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.594
Hey, man.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.987
I already told y'all
everything, man!

07:46.117 --> 07:48.293
I don't know nothing!
No, no, no, no, no.

07:48.424 --> 07:49.425
It's okay.
It's okay.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.905
No! No!It's just the lights.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.081
It's just the lights.
It's just the lights.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.126
I'm so sorry.
It's just the lights.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.737
It's just the lights.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.000
I'm so sorry.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.305
You remember Phil, right?

08:00.436 --> 08:01.524
He's just a friend.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.221
He's just a friend.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.832
He's just a friend.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.355
I'm sorry.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.705
It's okay.
It's okay.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.402
It's alright,
it's alright.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.558
I have to
tell you this.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.647
What, you're not gonna
vote for me?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.649
That what you
came over here to tell me?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.303
You're not gon'
vote for me?

08:44.567 --> 08:46.090
I heard you, uh,
made a big thing

08:46.221 --> 08:48.266
about Rufus Porter
at the debate.

08:48.397 --> 08:51.356
Yeah, the boy that had no name
now has a name.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.230
He was a snitch.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.582
Porter was a snitch.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.890
What?

09:03.020 --> 09:04.587
CPD informant.

09:06.110 --> 09:10.071
Oh, my God.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.464
Please don't say anything.Oh, my God.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.554
Not even your husband.

09:14.684 --> 09:15.990
I mean,
you know how it is.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.774
The family's gotta pay.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.820
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, I get it.

09:19.950 --> 09:24.738
I get it.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.567
Thought I should let you know,
'cause if you made him

09:27.697 --> 09:29.046
a part of your campaign,

09:29.177 --> 09:31.658
the press will start to dig,
and it wouldn't...

09:31.788 --> 09:34.574
Yeah.
You know.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.271
Yeah.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.976
How's your boy?

09:46.107 --> 09:48.326
So much better for having
your husband in his corner.

09:48.457 --> 09:51.286
Yeah, I-I meant --
I meant Joshua.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.902
They shot Rufus dead
right in front of him.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.512
Right in front of him.

10:03.864 --> 10:07.215
What's a child
supposed to do with that?

10:07.345 --> 10:08.956
Where do you put a thing
like that?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.757
Little to the left.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.194
A little to the left.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.195
A little more.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.893
A fraction more.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.071
Good.
Fire.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.434
Thank you
for coming here.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.263
I appreciate this.Sending data.

10:55.393 --> 10:58.005
Single bullet in a city
of three million people.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.964
2.74 million.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.749
What are our chances
of finding it?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.664
92% of CPD officers

11:04.794 --> 11:06.361
carry .9 millimeter Glocks.

11:06.491 --> 11:08.363
That sets the maximum
travel range of our bullet

11:08.493 --> 11:11.540
at 1,500 yards,
which is the furthest point.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
Now, this takes us as close
as we can get

11:13.803 --> 11:15.370
to the trajectory
of the bullet,

11:15.500 --> 11:16.676
then we feed in everything
we know

11:16.806 --> 11:18.199
about this moment
in time on the day of.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.635
Like what?

11:19.766 --> 11:21.724
Humidity was 14%,

11:21.855 --> 11:25.206
wind speed 9 miles an hour
from the south/southwest.

11:25.336 --> 11:29.036
Possible intercepting agent --
one passing L train.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.951
The train ran 45 seconds
late that day --

11:31.081 --> 11:33.257
So we rule that out.

11:33.388 --> 11:36.652
We find the bullet, we match it
to the officer's weapon.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.263
It either did or didn't
come from his gun.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.700
Now, striation marks
on bullets

11:40.830 --> 11:42.440
are always unique to
the one weapon it came from.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.966
It's like DNA and saliva.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.924
You okay?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.926
Let's, uh --
Let's get what we came for here

11:50.057 --> 11:52.537
before we lose the light.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.148
Okay.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.678
Big
Little Man.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.639
So, you her boyfriend now?

12:07.770 --> 12:09.337
So, you a dope boy now?

12:10.947 --> 12:12.470
Who told you that?Well, you musta dropped

12:12.601 --> 12:14.603
$300 in the bucket
at the barbecue.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.822
Okay. I worked
for that money.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.172
Sure you did.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.832
So, what now?
You gonna snitch to my mom?

12:25.962 --> 12:27.964
Hmm? How else can
we afford Franklin?

12:28.095 --> 12:29.009
Can't keep
our lights on.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.619
And he needs thousands.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.452
Hand me the P-trap.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.758
It's the one that looks
like the letter "P."

12:47.244 --> 12:50.726
Traps the water in the pipes,
keep the bad air out.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.293
Hand me that wrench.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.520
How'd you get that?

13:02.651 --> 13:04.522
Actin' a fool.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.962
Your mama --
that's a proud woman.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.051
Too proud to let me
in on family business,

13:11.181 --> 13:13.836
like what's happening
with your brother and his case.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.707
I respect it.
Yeah, man, I respect it,

13:15.838 --> 13:19.537
but it's frustrating
because I know I can help her.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.061
But I have a solution.

13:21.191 --> 13:24.238
You letting me in
on the Moses of it all,

13:24.368 --> 13:25.805
what she's saying
and thinking,

13:25.935 --> 13:27.850
and I'll keep what I know
about how you earn

13:27.981 --> 13:30.635
to myself.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.246
So, we have a deal?

13:37.860 --> 13:40.254
This is the landing radius
for the bullet.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.865
Now, we cross-checked it against
every police report

13:42.996 --> 13:44.693
of a gunshot that day.Mm-hmm.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.000
Then we correlated it
with the shot-spotter,

13:47.130 --> 13:50.046
and we come up
with four possible gunshots,

13:50.177 --> 13:52.353
but we can eliminate
these two.

13:52.483 --> 13:55.399
Okay. That shot Rufus
fired into the air...
Uh-huh.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.923
And Brannigan's shot
that killed him.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.968
That's right.Dad, let's go.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.361
Dad, let's go.

14:00.491 --> 14:01.666
Ooh.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.278
I promised him a boat
ride today.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.236
Extra credit for his --
his art class.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.629
To see the city's
arctic texture.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.413
Uh, no --
architecture.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.850
That's so cool, David.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.243
David, I need you to sit down
for a minute

14:13.374 --> 14:15.419
so I can finish up
my work, okay?

14:15.550 --> 14:16.638
Be right back.One minute.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.205
60 seconds.One minute, yes.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.250
One, two, three,
four, five...Two -- Two --

14:20.381 --> 14:21.643
Two bullets
in our landing radius.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.645
Okay, so it can't be
that one.Why not?

14:23.775 --> 14:25.603
Well, the police report said
it was a cabbie

14:25.734 --> 14:27.736
shot another cabbie
over a fare.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.390
But --40 seconds left, Dad.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.870
Okay, hold on, David.
Just a few more minutes, okay?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.132
Just --
Just a few more minutes.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.611
What --
What about this one?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.309
A woman called in a gunshot
from her home address

14:35.439 --> 14:37.267
on 73rd Street.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.443
What time?
25.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.316
That's almost an hour
after Logan fired his gun.

14:42.446 --> 14:43.708
It's what we have.That doesn't make sense.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.014
We need something
more than that.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.974
David! David!
Damn it,

14:48.104 --> 14:49.932
I said for you
to sit down, David!

14:50.063 --> 14:52.152
No, no, no! No!Oh, no.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.197
I'm so sorry.
Dav--

14:54.328 --> 14:57.461
No, no, no, no!

14:57.592 --> 15:00.247
I'm sorry, baby...

15:00.377 --> 15:01.901
I'm sorry.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.254
Yeah, uh, nothing's broken.
It's okay.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.834
David, your father
is a good guy.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.541
I want to sit second chair
at the trial.

15:37.066 --> 15:40.504
We're very different.That's why
it's a good idea.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.897
I see what you don't see.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
And vice versa?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.423
That would be
for you to say.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.295
The case is --

15:48.425 --> 15:49.774
The case is particular.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.212
For the optics?

15:52.342 --> 15:54.562
You mean 'cause I'm white?

15:54.692 --> 15:58.218
Kinda thought that
was the point.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.046
This case
is about all of us.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.400
Why are you laughing?

16:06.530 --> 16:08.228
Just a little self-aggrandizing
there.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.490
Mm-hmm.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.101
Well, this is our street.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.414
A day drinker.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.111
Beautiful.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.687
Hello, I'm --
Shh.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.694
I win something?

16:39.824 --> 16:43.002
I-I was hoping that youwould
help mewin something.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.656
A trial.

16:45.787 --> 16:46.962
This is
Miss Nicole Carter.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.879
She's...

16:51.010 --> 16:52.446
She's my second chair.

16:52.576 --> 16:55.362
Good for Nicole Carter.
Something I noticed?

16:55.492 --> 16:58.234
Fancy folk get two names
when they get introduced.

16:58.365 --> 17:01.977
Poor folk get one,
if they get introduced at all.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.980
On May 1st,
you reported a gunshot.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.027
You reported it at20
in the afternoon.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.593
Was that when
you heard it?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.338
No.
No? Earlier?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.036
How much earlier?
An hour?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.428
Could be.
Okay.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.082
Why did you wait
to call it in?

17:20.213 --> 17:22.519
Called it in when I got
around to it.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.087
Some of us got lives.
Didn't matter none.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.741
Once they heard I wasn't shot,
they never even

17:26.871 --> 17:28.003
sent someone
to take a look.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.135
Take a look
at what, ma'am?

17:29.265 --> 17:31.398
My baby.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.182
Your baby?

17:36.185 --> 17:38.231
Mm-hmm.
She's a beauty, ain't she?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.454
Oh. We needed
a bullet,

17:44.585 --> 17:46.413
and we got
a bullet hole.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.024
You mean
a bullet like this?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.808
Well, if I wasn't married,
I'd kiss you right now.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.463
I won't tell no one.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.465
No.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.337
Look here.
Can we just -- Can we just --

17:57.467 --> 17:59.295
Can you do me a favor
and let us

17:59.426 --> 18:01.036
borrow that for a minute?

18:01.167 --> 18:02.603
Oh, no, no, no, no.No, no,
just for a minute.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.387
No, no, sir. I need all the luck
I can get in this world.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.649
Look --
Mm-hmm.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.347
I already won bingo
three times

18:07.477 --> 18:09.000
since I been
wearin' it.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.350
Ma'am, we just need to
borrow --Sorry, mister.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.742
No.

18:11.873 --> 18:15.398
And my lucky charm stays
around my neck.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.097
But -- But bullets are
for killing people.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.576
They -- They kill you.

18:19.707 --> 18:24.190
Sometimes they hurt you
and they don't kill you.

18:24.320 --> 18:29.673
Sometimes they hurt you,
then you die, slowly.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.197
That's what
they're meant for.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.852
They're not meant
for winning bingo games.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.898
Hi, my name's, uh,
David Roberts.

18:37.028 --> 18:40.206
What's yours?

18:40.336 --> 18:41.859
Gloria Hendrix.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.303
Gotcha, huh?

19:06.449 --> 19:08.147
Work for me
and no one gonna try

19:08.277 --> 19:09.365
to turn you into
a fireball.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.150
You feel me?

19:11.280 --> 19:13.326
What you doing today gonna help
you across the board.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.910
- - 17.
Afternoon session.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.695
17. Got it.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.087
For The Nation.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.219
For The Nation.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.613
Alright,
say hello to my boy.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.964
Say hello.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.618
I can't.
I --

19:47.316 --> 19:48.883
No.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.714
Walk the yard.
Lotty'll take you through it.

20:08.772 --> 20:09.904
Hey, count good.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.993
Count always good.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.307
Hey, I'm thirsty.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.396
Go handle that.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.807
'Sup, Sosa?

21:04.959 --> 21:07.266
Should I go ahead?
Look.

21:10.181 --> 21:11.879
Damn Chinese-made...

21:12.009 --> 21:14.795
Count this mess by hand.

21:22.672 --> 21:26.720
Ooh. Mm.
That's what I'm talking about.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.549
Man, look.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.507
She thirsty as hell.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.423
Oh, oh.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.094
Yeah. Uh.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.923
How's it going?

21:56.053 --> 21:57.577
Oh, hi.
Hi, Mrs. Porter.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.883
Yes, hold on one --
I'm gonna have to go.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.668
Okay?
How's it going?

22:01.798 --> 22:04.540
You good?Yes, I'm good.

22:04.671 --> 22:05.933
Let's go outside.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.284
So, I'm an embarrassment?

22:09.415 --> 22:10.372
I'm an embarrassment
to you?

22:10.503 --> 22:11.634
You're not
embarrassing me.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.027
I just wanted
you and I to talk.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.464
No, no.
I see who you are.

22:15.595 --> 22:18.902
You're using my son
and my pain for money.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.643
And you know what else
I'm discovering, too?

22:20.774 --> 22:22.297
There is no "us".

22:22.428 --> 22:23.516
There's grieving mothers,

22:23.646 --> 22:25.953
and then there's BLM pimps
like you.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.737
You used my son's name
one time --

22:27.868 --> 22:30.044
I had my reasons.What's the reason?

22:30.174 --> 22:33.439
I can't tell you that.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.788
You don't get to do that.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.442
You don't get to pull
no secret shit on me

22:36.572 --> 22:38.705
and then not say
what it is.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.750
Nah. I get it.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.404
I see you.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.406
It wouldn't look good for your
husband and his special client

22:44.537 --> 22:45.973
to have his wife
doing shout-outs

22:46.103 --> 22:48.149
for The Nation, right?

22:48.279 --> 22:51.370
Old Saint Franklin
told his wife to pipe down.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.850
Didn't want his special
Moses Johnson

22:53.981 --> 22:57.158
getting all muddied up
in some gang shit.

22:57.288 --> 23:00.379
It's just like I said --
you Hyde Park liberals,

23:00.509 --> 23:02.990
all you care about it's
the life of a scholarship boy.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.688
You and your husband ain't
no better than the rest of 'em.

23:05.819 --> 23:07.342
So you think I'm a pimp.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.430
P-I-M-P.

23:08.561 --> 23:09.475
Oh --
Pimp.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.391
You know what?

23:12.521 --> 23:14.393
I am a pimp.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.046
What you think
your cut should be?

23:16.177 --> 23:17.396
What?
Huh?

23:17.526 --> 23:19.267
What do you think
your cut should be?

23:19.398 --> 23:22.923
How much was Rufus worth?

23:23.053 --> 23:24.925
You don't --
How much --
How much was he worth?

23:25.055 --> 23:26.187
That's not what I'm saying,
and you know it.For his eyes, his arms,

23:26.317 --> 23:27.971
his legs, his memory.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.712
You know what? I will go --Now you --

23:29.843 --> 23:31.366
No, you know what --
I will go...You just putting on a show.

23:31.497 --> 23:32.976
...in -- in -- in --

23:33.107 --> 23:35.196
in the campaign headquarters
right now and get a check.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.502
That is not
what I am saying.And write it outfor you.

23:36.632 --> 23:40.331
How much --
How much was it worth?

23:40.462 --> 23:42.203
This has never been
about the money.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.422
It's never about
the money.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.381
I mean, but why should
I struggle?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.992
I never wanted to say
your son's name.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.777
Never wanted to say
your son's name.

23:50.907 --> 23:52.431
I hated saying his name.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.215
I hate it that
it's a hundred other names

23:54.345 --> 23:57.044
that I could say
in his place.

23:57.174 --> 24:00.395
I know how you feel about me,
and I don't blame you,

24:00.526 --> 24:03.050
but I need you to look me
in my eye and know

24:03.180 --> 24:05.400
that I am not throwing you
and Rufus away.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.445
I'm not doing that.

24:06.575 --> 24:07.881
P-I-M-P.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.404
Pimp.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.370
You're buying, right?

24:19.501 --> 24:21.416
Like yesterday?Yeah, like yesterday.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.070
Look, I'm sorry,
alright?

24:23.200 --> 24:24.898
She's bleeding me dry.

24:25.028 --> 24:27.553
You ever hard of
a Rodney Dangerfield marriage?

24:27.683 --> 24:29.468
My wife and I were happy
for 20 years.

24:29.598 --> 24:30.512
And then we met.And then we met.

24:30.643 --> 24:31.948
Right. Yeah.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.169
Hello. Can I get
two sausage muffins, please?

24:37.519 --> 24:39.086
Thank you.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.391
I'm all set. Right,
you wanna find somewhere to sit?

24:40.522 --> 24:41.958
Yeah, let's get out
of here first.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.440
You guys are good.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.763
Brannigan.Hey. Listen.

25:03.893 --> 25:06.940
That offer that's on the table,
it needs an answer.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.159
Butler Boathouse.
30.

25:26.699 --> 25:28.396
Alright.

25:35.098 --> 25:36.317
This line right here,

25:36.447 --> 25:40.234
imagine it go
all the way to the wall.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.628
That's where the package
gon' be.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.152
What's in the package?Something important.

25:47.850 --> 25:50.026
So, don't worry about none
of the ground guards.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
I got them covered.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.377
It's the watch tower.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.683
That's the wildcard.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.903
Guards can see us,
we can't see them.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.776
Just means
you gotta be quick.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.344
Scoop up the package,
stuff it in your drawers.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.699
I can't do this, Lotty.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.574
Oh, you can.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.358
And you will.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.280
This is a collect call
from an inmate

26:26.410 --> 26:27.673
in a correctional facility.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.326
Will you accept
the charges?

26:29.457 --> 26:30.850
Yes.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.591
There he is.

26:32.721 --> 26:33.809
Needed to hear
my little brother

26:33.940 --> 26:35.811
bitching about his day.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.552
How you doing?
Yeah.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.380
I'm alright.
You?

26:39.510 --> 26:42.078
Good.
I'm good.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.167
How is she, man?

26:44.298 --> 26:46.300
She took
some extra shifts.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.432
We both workin' hard for you,
Mo, for real.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.878
Hey, G, Speak been sweatin' me
about becoming official

26:59.008 --> 27:00.488
with The Nation.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.098
Yeah?

27:02.229 --> 27:03.360
Yeah, don't worry
about me or nothing.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.972
Just so you know.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.321
I wanted to tell you.

27:11.455 --> 27:12.935
What you tell him?

27:13.066 --> 27:15.068
Shit is complicated
in here, little brother.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.984
Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, listen, man,
you gotta let that go, alright?

27:18.114 --> 27:21.814
Everybody cliques up in jail.
That's how you get through.

27:21.944 --> 27:24.251
Joshua Johnson,

27:24.381 --> 27:27.123
talking like
he a little Speak or something.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.038
Man, why d'you call him "Speak"
all the time, man?

27:29.169 --> 27:30.518
He our dad.

27:33.042 --> 27:35.654
Mo.
Mo.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.568
No, don't worry
about me, bro.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.483
I'm good.
I'm good.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.443
Alright, man.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.445
One love, bro.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.621
Proud of you, shorty.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.057
Man of the house.

27:48.188 --> 27:49.668
Alright, man.
Alright.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.272
Where's Soldier Field?

28:29.403 --> 28:31.144
Uh, you can't see it
from here.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.406
Football, right?

28:32.536 --> 28:34.321
That's right.
The Bears.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.149
Bears playing football.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.716
That's right.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.089
David.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.276
You okay, Dad?

29:16.406 --> 29:18.495
I'm okay.
You like hugs today.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.062
I like hugs today.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.763
I like hugs today.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.845
Guards! Medic!

30:03.976 --> 30:05.281
Guard!

30:07.718 --> 30:09.285
Get down on the ground!

30:09.416 --> 30:11.200
Stay down!
Face down!

30:23.473 --> 30:27.695
Down, down, down!
Stay down!

30:31.699 --> 30:32.961
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

30:33.092 --> 30:34.397
Face down!

30:40.577 --> 30:43.885
Ah, the prize.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.279
Your first pack.
Go feed the people.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.889
You gotta earn your keep.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.896
Hey.
Hey.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.680
So, what do you think
about Dante?

31:44.990 --> 31:47.079
I think that extra 5%'s
gonna add up fast.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.910
Money's money.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.650
What makes or breaks the men
in our world

31:53.781 --> 31:56.001
is the company we keep.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.828
The Faction's
been good to us.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.788
The devil you know.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.094
So, why switch?

32:02.224 --> 32:04.183
Dante's got
the stronger operation.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.358
Better intel.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.360
Better discipline.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.883
And all that fracturing
with the old gangs --

32:09.014 --> 32:09.971
that's not gonna happen
with The Nation.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.713
They're built to last.
Hm.

32:12.843 --> 32:15.107
Strong infrastructure
and no cliques,

32:15.237 --> 32:16.412
clear hierarchy.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.551
Did Michael Rossi tell you
he was looking into me?

32:55.234 --> 32:57.149
What the hell was that?

32:58.498 --> 33:01.936
Rufus knew about our deal
with The Faction,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.765
and he was about to
get chatty.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.419
So he had to go.

33:08.638 --> 33:11.946
He had a gun.

33:12.077 --> 33:15.950
Sometimes in life,
everything just lines up.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.257
Rufus had a gun,
I took him out,

33:18.387 --> 33:20.215
Christmas came early.

33:22.304 --> 33:26.787
What happened to your partner
was a tragic accident,

33:26.917 --> 33:28.571
but here's the truth --

33:31.922 --> 33:33.359
he went out easy.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.939
Tell Dante
he's got a deal.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.078
Ah.

34:06.653 --> 34:09.960
A year ago,
this fit me.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.919
What happened?
You put on some weight?

34:15.923 --> 34:17.359
Lost 10 pounds.

34:19.187 --> 34:23.887
Look at you.
Look at my man.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.368
Whoo.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.675
So, uh...

34:28.805 --> 34:31.243
I gotta -- I gotta talk
tomorrow in court?

34:31.373 --> 34:32.940
Tomorrow's on me.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.335
Um, but you're worried
about talking in court.

34:36.465 --> 34:41.166
Um, just answer the questions,
keep your answers short,

34:41.296 --> 34:44.473
to the point, stay calm,
and don't get riled.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.351
That's what every lawyer
tells his client.

34:52.481 --> 34:54.092
Bad advice.

34:54.222 --> 34:57.007
Totally wrong.

34:57.138 --> 35:04.102
When you're on the stand,
I want to see the real Moses.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.104
Not the courtroom
Mr. Johnson.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.847
This is how we win.

35:10.978 --> 35:14.547
You being yourself.

35:14.677 --> 35:18.072
Telling it like it is.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.959
Do you think
they'll see me?

35:40.747 --> 35:46.970
That's what this whole trial
is about, Moses.

35:47.101 --> 35:52.106
Maybe even what
this whole country is about --

35:52.237 --> 35:55.805
the idea of you.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.161
Hmm.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.949
So...

36:09.079 --> 36:11.386
who are you?

36:11.517 --> 36:12.431
Hmm?

36:17.087 --> 36:18.524
Clear your mind.

36:20.830 --> 36:24.791
Narrow your focus
just down to one thing.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.228
On the block, blank,

36:27.359 --> 36:31.798
nothing, real still,
hold for the gun.

36:36.106 --> 36:38.413
Explode outta there
on the "B" of the bang.

36:38.544 --> 36:42.896
Don't come up early,
don't come up late.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.159
Stay strong coming out
of the first bend.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.947
Then it's about
the cadence,

36:51.078 --> 36:53.167
the stride pattern,
rhythm.

36:55.430 --> 36:56.910
100 to 300.

37:00.348 --> 37:03.569
After that,
it's home straight.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.048
Don't get tight.

37:05.179 --> 37:09.705
Shoulders loose, knees high,
arms pumping.

37:09.836 --> 37:14.406
Last 20 --
do not get tight.

37:14.536 --> 37:16.190
Dip.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.324
Win.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.500
That's me, Speak.

37:21.630 --> 37:22.979
That's who I am.

37:42.695 --> 37:47.134
So, um, what do I wear

37:47.265 --> 37:49.528
to the trial of the man
who killed my husband?

37:54.968 --> 37:58.754
Um, you, um --
you wear black.

38:03.846 --> 38:10.331
And you let yourself cry,
if you have to.

38:10.462 --> 38:15.293
And if the jury sees,
then that's -- that's fine.

38:32.484 --> 38:36.226
Sometimes the grief -- I just --
I don't see it coming.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.880
You know?

38:41.928 --> 38:43.669
I do.

39:16.223 --> 39:18.138
We found the bullet.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.403
They shot at my boy.

39:22.534 --> 39:23.622
Mm-hmm.
Yes, they did.

39:23.752 --> 39:24.971
And here's
what really matters --

39:25.101 --> 39:26.581
they lied about it.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.369
It's $4,000.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.546
Community's been
so generous.

39:34.676 --> 39:38.506
If I didn't need it,
I would not take it.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.827
Martha?

39:54.957 --> 39:56.524
Where you at?

39:56.655 --> 39:58.265
Ooh.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.008
Huh.

40:05.490 --> 40:07.274
What you doing, girl?

40:08.231 --> 40:10.364
What you doing?

40:12.627 --> 40:15.456
Martha?
What you doing?

40:15.587 --> 40:16.849
What if I win?

40:18.720 --> 40:19.895
I don't understand,
baby.

40:20.026 --> 40:23.290
I'll be representing
60,000 people.

40:23.421 --> 40:28.295
Their lives, their actual lives,
all of that -- on me.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.694
You stronger
than you think, girl.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.523
Look at
that gorgeous poster.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.613
See, you got to do
what you do.
Wow.

40:41.743 --> 40:45.617
'Cause you had me at home
looking after our son.

40:45.747 --> 40:46.879
I don't have a "me".Wait, what are you --

40:47.009 --> 40:48.576
what are you --
what are you saying?

40:48.707 --> 40:52.624
Martha, what are you --I asked you,
and you said yes.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.409
17 years I gave you,
and what do I get?

40:55.540 --> 40:57.367
Martha...
What do I get?

40:57.498 --> 41:00.022
What are you doing?A broken promise.

41:00.153 --> 41:01.937
You -- You -- You know what
a broken promise is?

41:02.068 --> 41:03.852
Martha, you -- what are you --Yeah,
you know what it is.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.506
It's a lie.

41:08.466 --> 41:11.251
That's not fair.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm not a liar.

41:11.381 --> 41:13.993
Alright, you not a liar,
so --

41:14.123 --> 41:16.474
so what do you call it?

41:16.604 --> 41:19.607
What do you call it when a man
doesn't tell his wife

41:19.738 --> 41:22.523
that he's not taking
the medicine that he needs to --

41:22.654 --> 41:24.917
to keep him alive?

41:25.047 --> 41:27.615
You haven't taken
one pill. Not one.

41:27.746 --> 41:29.748
Side effects --
poor concentration,

41:29.878 --> 41:31.140
low energy, insomnia.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.664
The trial is tomorrow,
Martha.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.448
I-I got to be sharp,
I gotta be ready.

41:34.579 --> 41:35.754
For who?
Moses Johnson.

41:35.884 --> 41:39.105
Oh, God.
Would you stop saying that?!

41:39.235 --> 41:40.889
You haven't told him,
have you?

41:43.501 --> 41:45.241
David, have you told him?

41:48.810 --> 41:50.290
No.

41:50.420 --> 41:51.857
Wow.

41:57.384 --> 41:58.820
Yeah.

42:03.695 --> 42:09.222
See, I thought I married
a man of -- of integrity...

42:09.352 --> 42:11.877
Martha --
...and courage.

42:12.007 --> 42:12.878
Don't.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.490
That's what I thought.

43:11.110 --> 43:12.590
On the next episode of
"61st Street"...

43:12.720 --> 43:13.982
Can't park here.You really wanna stop a mother

43:14.113 --> 43:15.767
from seeing her son?Out of the van.

43:15.897 --> 43:19.248
The Chicago Police Department
is a terrorist organization.

43:19.379 --> 43:20.946
Do you expect me
to tell the truth?!

43:21.076 --> 43:23.209
I remind you,
you are under oath.

43:23.339 --> 43:24.645
How is all this
being paid for?

43:24.776 --> 43:26.342
What are you talking about?Ask your wife.

43:26.473 --> 43:28.693
It's Moses or me.
That's your choice.

43:28.823 --> 43:30.303
Open it up.

43:31.347 --> 43:32.479
How long you known about this?

43:32.610 --> 43:33.828
He's taking care of
his mother --

43:33.959 --> 43:35.308
more than you can
or ever will be.
