00:47.200 --> 00:49.050
[Yawn]

00:49.083 --> 00:51.333
Time to get up.

00:56.283 --> 01:00.116
Ah, sweet floor.

01:00.150 --> 01:01.266
[Kiss]

01:01.300 --> 01:05.200
So, what is
on the agenda for today?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.150
Carnival!
Carnival!

01:10.333 --> 01:12.200
Mom!

01:12.233 --> 01:14.100
Kids!

01:14.133 --> 01:15.200
More eggs, dear?

01:15.233 --> 01:17.100
Honey, your eggs
are De--

01:17.133 --> 01:22.050
carnival! Carnival!

[Bang]

01:24.433 --> 01:25.416
[Bang]

01:25.450 --> 01:26.383
Uh-oh.

01:26.416 --> 01:29.233
Dad, you forgot
Dexter's phone books again.

01:29.266 --> 01:31.266
Dexter, it--it was
a simple mistake.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.450
I--i had to look up
a number for your mother.

01:33.483 --> 01:35.416
It's her fault,
not mine!

01:35.450 --> 01:37.333
Why, I...I--

01:37.366 --> 01:40.016
[grumbling]

01:40.050 --> 01:40.333
What did he say?

01:40.366 --> 01:43.066
He said,
"just forget it."

01:43.100 --> 01:45.216
Whew!
Whew!

01:45.416 --> 01:48.083
Oh, I am so excited.

01:48.116 --> 01:50.350
This carnival's really
going to be a hoot.

01:50.383 --> 01:53.400
Dad: It sure is.
And that super-fast
new ride,

01:53.433 --> 01:55.200
uh...what's
it called again?

01:55.233 --> 01:56.133
It's called--

01:56.166 --> 01:58.116
it's called "the thing,"
and it's creepy!

01:58.150 --> 02:00.066
Dexter,
from far away:
Did you know

02:00.100 --> 02:03.183
it took 3 billion
individual nuts
and bolts to--

02:03.216 --> 02:05.100
and I just<i>love</i>
Ferris wheels.

02:05.133 --> 02:08.433
And funnel cakes.
Mmm! That's good eatin'.

02:08.466 --> 02:09.400
[Doorbell rings]

02:09.433 --> 02:11.383
Dexter: I'll get it.

02:12.416 --> 02:13.333
Mailman!

02:13.366 --> 02:16.116
Got some mail!

02:16.150 --> 02:17.166
I can take that.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.150
Huh? What?
Who said that?

02:19.183 --> 02:24.433
I heard a voice,
but I do not know
from where it came.

02:25.283 --> 02:26.366
Next stop...

02:26.400 --> 02:29.183
All: Carnival!

02:30.250 --> 02:33.283
Dad: Hey, why
don't we play a game
to pass the time?

02:33.316 --> 02:36.000
Ok, ok!
Let's play "I spy."

02:36.033 --> 02:40.016
I spy, with my little eye,
something...Brown.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.350
Guess, Dexter.

02:42.350 --> 02:43.283
Car door?

02:43.316 --> 02:44.216
No.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.200
Sky?

02:45.233 --> 02:46.166
Nope.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.483
I give up.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.183
Dee Dee: Cows.

02:50.216 --> 02:51.000
Oh.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.300
Dad, are we
almost there?

02:52.333 --> 02:56.266
Not yet, son.
We won't be there
for at least another...

02:56.300 --> 02:57.183
Oh, no!

02:57.216 --> 02:59.150
Wait. We're here.

03:00.216 --> 03:03.000
But, dad, do we have
to do that first?

03:03.033 --> 03:05.000
It's so degrading.

03:05.033 --> 03:07.466
Nonsense. It's
family fun, Dexter.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.183
And it's
the only game Dee Dee
ever wants to play.

03:11.216 --> 03:13.466
Yeah! Come on,
Dexter.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.066
Aw, man.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.216
Come on, folks,

03:17.250 --> 03:18.216
toss your brother!

03:18.250 --> 03:21.266
Win cheaply made
stuffed toys.
You can't lose.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.333
Who's next?

03:22.366 --> 03:23.150
Me!

03:23.183 --> 03:25.066
Oh, I don't like
this part.

03:25.100 --> 03:28.200
Hold still, will ya?
I'm aiming.

03:30.350 --> 03:31.200
[Crash]

03:31.233 --> 03:34.100
Hey, direct hit!
Good job, Dee Dee.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.083
Here's your prize,
young lady.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.250
Isn't family fun
great?

03:39.283 --> 03:40.283
Oh, yeah.

03:40.316 --> 03:42.250
Ah, cheer up,
little Dexter.

03:42.283 --> 03:46.100
I couldn't have won
a "my sparkly unicorn"
without you.

03:46.133 --> 03:48.100
And without
a blockhead like yours,

03:48.133 --> 03:50.100
I'd have to
carry it around all day.

03:50.133 --> 03:53.416
Dee Dee, stop using
your brother as a table.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.366
Yes, sir.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.016
Look! It's...It's...

03:57.050 --> 03:59.316
The thing!

04:00.066 --> 04:03.300
10,000 tons of steel!
20 million nuts and bolts!

04:03.333 --> 04:06.000
Speeds up to
9,000 miles per hour!

Total estimated
riding time:

04:08.383 --> 04:10.316
7...

04:10.350 --> 04:11.400
Seconds.

04:11.433 --> 04:14.083
Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh!

04:14.116 --> 04:16.066
Kids: Let's get in line!

04:16.100 --> 04:18.283
Dear, do you
think it's safe?

04:18.316 --> 04:19.283
Of course, honey.

04:19.316 --> 04:23.000
There's no safer rides
than carnival rides.

04:23.033 --> 04:24.316
[Screaming]

04:29.150 --> 04:30.166
We're next!

04:30.200 --> 04:33.250
Ok, how many
in your party? 3?

04:33.283 --> 04:34.483
4.

04:36.166 --> 04:40.150
Uh, doesn't he look
a little small
for this ride?

04:40.183 --> 04:42.350
We're here to have
family fun!

04:42.383 --> 04:44.466
No, sir. You
don't understand.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.166
The kid
is too little!

04:47.200 --> 04:48.216
Family fun?

04:48.250 --> 04:51.183
Child...too...small.

04:51.216 --> 04:52.016
Uh...

04:52.050 --> 04:53.366
Ok, let me show you.

04:53.400 --> 04:58.283
Your son is too short
to ride "the thing."

05:02.450 --> 05:05.233
I am too little
to do anything.

05:05.266 --> 05:09.133
Mom and dad and Dee Dee
are all riding
"the thing,"

05:09.166 --> 05:13.316
and I'm waiting
in this stupid
petting zoo.

05:13.350 --> 05:16.016
I wish I was taller.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.116
Wait a minute!

05:18.150 --> 05:22.100
I'm a genius,
and I've got a lab!

05:22.133 --> 05:25.216
I will be tall!

05:33.133 --> 05:36.333
[Screaming]

05:40.016 --> 05:42.133
[Cock-a-doodle-doo]

05:49.350 --> 05:53.216
Well, hello, knees!

06:03.216 --> 06:05.116
[Doorbell rings]

06:05.150 --> 06:08.166
Ah, you must be
the man of the house.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.416
You're darn tootin'.

06:09.450 --> 06:12.433
I can't believe
dad let you borrow
his car!

06:12.466 --> 06:13.300
Me neither.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.300
For a dad, he can be
pretty hip.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.316
[Tires screech]

06:16.350 --> 06:18.000
Ah, conquest.

06:18.033 --> 06:20.116
Come on,
I can see the line.

06:20.150 --> 06:22.183
Jeepers!

06:24.316 --> 06:28.283
Ah! 275 minutes
in line!

06:45.033 --> 06:48.400
Hey, Dexter!
Looks like
we're next!

06:48.433 --> 06:50.033
Dexter?

06:50.066 --> 06:53.133
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
We're next!

07:01.000 --> 07:05.033
Dexter: I'm on top
of the worl--

07:10.316 --> 07:15.433
This is the greatest day
of my entire life!

07:30.400 --> 07:32.033
[Beep]

07:32.066 --> 07:33.016
[Beep]

07:33.050 --> 07:34.066
[Series of beeps]

07:34.100 --> 07:34.466
Dexter: Yes!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.416
Energy force activated.

07:36.450 --> 07:40.183
Now to increase
modulation fluctuation.

07:40.216 --> 07:41.483
Perfect!

07:42.016 --> 07:47.216
Now to open and enhance
the compostulating
amplitudinators.

07:48.116 --> 07:49.016
Yes!

07:49.050 --> 07:50.366
Exact frequency attained!

07:50.400 --> 07:54.250
Now for
the final component...

07:56.416 --> 08:00.000
The nuclear core!

08:02.333 --> 08:05.350
At last! It is complete!

08:05.383 --> 08:06.200
Now,

08:06.233 --> 08:08.383
for the ultimate test.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.050
At last!

08:16.083 --> 08:20.050
The ultimate reading lamp.

08:20.466 --> 08:21.333
Ah!

08:21.366 --> 08:24.266
The perfect book
with which to test

08:24.300 --> 08:26.066
the ultimate reading lamp.

08:26.100 --> 08:30.133
Now, time for
ultimate relaxation.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.016
What is wrong?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.316
What could have happened?

08:38.350 --> 08:39.450
Everything was perfect!

08:39.483 --> 08:42.150
Everything
is in working order,

08:42.183 --> 08:44.366
from the dilateral
maltriculators

08:44.400 --> 08:46.316
to the extemporaneal outlet,

08:46.350 --> 08:50.100
right down
to the nuclear core.

08:50.133 --> 08:50.483
Huh?

08:51.016 --> 08:54.250
[Dee Dee's voice]

08:59.300 --> 09:00.250
Dee Dee!

09:00.283 --> 09:04.116
She does not realize
the danger she has caused!

09:04.150 --> 09:07.316
If I do not retrieve
the nuclear core in one hour,

09:07.350 --> 09:10.333
it will melt down,
causing a chain reaction

09:10.366 --> 09:12.083
which will
destroy the earth!

09:12.116 --> 09:14.433
And I won't be able
to read my book!

09:14.466 --> 09:16.333
No time to waste!

09:16.366 --> 09:17.433
[Skidding]

09:17.466 --> 09:21.150
[Dexter reading]

09:21.183 --> 09:22.000
Computer,

09:22.033 --> 09:23.400
analyze clue
and find solution.

09:23.433 --> 09:28.083
Computer: Apple, cherry,
blueberry, r squared.

09:28.116 --> 09:31.400
Pi is r squared,
if you remember your calculus.

09:31.433 --> 09:35.166
And apple, cherry,
and blueberry are flavors.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.466
Dexter: Of course!
Mother is baking pies today.

09:42.450 --> 09:46.200
Hmm...which pie
holds the next clue?

09:46.233 --> 09:47.466
Mom: Dexter!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.016
Yipe!

09:49.050 --> 09:50.233
Ah.

09:50.266 --> 09:52.366
If you wanted
some pie, honey,

09:52.400 --> 09:54.266
all you had to do
was ask.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.200
Which flavor
do you want?

09:56.233 --> 09:57.316
One of each, mother.

09:57.350 --> 10:01.350
That way I can find
the next clue for sure.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.216
[Chomp]

10:09.333 --> 10:12.100
My, you were hungry.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.000
I hope you have
room for dinner.

10:14.033 --> 10:16.150
We're having pot pie!

10:16.183 --> 10:22.466
Oh! I have eaten all the pie,
and still no clue!

10:23.000 --> 10:25.416
[Dexter reading]

10:25.450 --> 10:28.116
Ah! The next clue!

10:28.150 --> 10:29.316
Oh! Ugh!

10:29.350 --> 10:33.066
[Sloshing]

10:34.316 --> 10:36.100
[Panting]

10:36.133 --> 10:37.483
How much time left?

10:38.016 --> 10:40.216
I must get
the next clue,

10:40.250 --> 10:43.233
even if it means
knocking on the door

10:43.266 --> 10:48.316
of the dreaded
touchy-feely
neighbor lady!

10:48.350 --> 10:50.166
Oh, hi there!

10:50.200 --> 10:52.416
You are so cute!

10:52.450 --> 10:55.450
You're getting
so big!

10:55.483 --> 10:56.383
Heh heh.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.016
Thank you, ma'am

10:58.050 --> 11:02.083
now, you just
come on in
and have a seat

11:02.116 --> 11:03.166
and I'll get you
some yummy cookies!

11:03.200 --> 11:07.016
Ah, actually,
I'd rather have
a nuclear reactor core,

11:07.050 --> 11:09.466
if you happen to have one
lying around.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.050
[Laughing obnoxiously]

11:12.083 --> 11:15.216
You kids are so funny!

11:15.250 --> 11:18.100
And<i>so cute!</i>

11:18.133 --> 11:19.350
I'll be right back.

11:19.383 --> 11:21.216
I must get
the next clue!

11:21.250 --> 11:23.383
Maybe it's
in the kitchen!

11:24.250 --> 11:27.300
[Humming]

11:27.333 --> 11:28.283
Whoops!

11:28.316 --> 11:30.400
Clumsy me.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.250
[Dexter reading clue]

11:32.283 --> 11:34.150
Ha! That's it!

11:34.183 --> 11:36.400
Father's trophy.

11:36.433 --> 11:40.150
The prized swordfish.

11:40.316 --> 11:43.433
I must take great care
not to damage the fish.

11:43.466 --> 11:46.450
I will have to use
a delicate touch

11:46.483 --> 11:50.100
so as not to harm
the next clue.

11:51.383 --> 11:52.466
Eureka!

11:53.000 --> 11:56.150
Dad: Come on
in here, Phil,
and I'll show you

11:56.183 --> 11:58.483
my prized swordfish.

11:59.233 --> 12:03.016
Well, I caught him
off the coast
of Florida.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.266
Yes, he put up
quite a fight,

12:05.300 --> 12:07.283
but I won out
in the end.

12:07.316 --> 12:08.316
Hey, come on in here,

12:08.350 --> 12:11.283
and I'll show you
my glow-in-the-dark
chess game.

12:11.316 --> 12:13.116
Dexter: Whew!

12:13.150 --> 12:15.300
Hmm.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.250
Ptooey!

12:20.283 --> 12:24.150
[Dee Dee's voice]

12:25.183 --> 12:29.066
At last!
The final clue!

12:29.100 --> 12:35.133
Dare I enter the dreaded
booby trapped no man's land?

12:36.150 --> 12:37.283
2 minutes left.

12:37.316 --> 12:39.400
Let's do it!

12:48.450 --> 12:50.433
Stay out of the light!

12:53.216 --> 12:57.016
Close but not close
enough, Dee Dee.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.466
Huh?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.150
No!

13:01.183 --> 13:03.283
Cooties!

13:03.316 --> 13:05.183
[Screaming]

13:10.466 --> 13:12.233
Hmm.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.050
Whew!

13:28.150 --> 13:29.216
No!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.066
[Screaming]

13:39.366 --> 13:42.100
Just in time!

13:42.133 --> 13:43.150
[Sigh]

13:43.183 --> 13:47.383
Once again, my enormous
intellect has triumphed.

13:47.416 --> 13:50.066
Now I can test
my new lamp

13:50.100 --> 13:52.083
and read my book in--

13:52.116 --> 13:54.183
no! The book is gone!

13:54.216 --> 13:55.250
How can--

13:55.283 --> 13:56.350
huh?

13:56.383 --> 13:57.383
Dee Dee: Dear Dexter,

13:57.416 --> 13:59.266
if you want
to get your book back,

13:59.300 --> 14:01.266
just follow the clues.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.300
No!

14:02.333 --> 14:06.383
Dee Dee!

14:10.383 --> 14:14.333
Dee Dee, I heard
this great joke!

14:14.366 --> 14:15.350
[Laughing]

14:15.383 --> 14:16.266
Ok, here it goes.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.316
A physics professor
and his assistant

14:18.350 --> 14:22.400
were working on liberating
negatively charged
hydroxyl ions,

14:22.433 --> 14:25.066
when all of a sudden,
the assistant says,

14:25.100 --> 14:31.066
"wait, professor! What if
the salicylic acids don't
accept the hydroxyl ion?"

14:31.100 --> 14:32.450
And the professor responds,

14:32.483 --> 14:36.400
"that's no hydroxyl ion.
That's my wife!"

14:36.433 --> 14:39.183
[Laughing]

15:39.116 --> 15:42.166
[Maniacal laughter]

15:44.233 --> 15:45.183
Yes! Yes!

15:45.216 --> 15:49.150
At last, my greatest
creation is...

15:49.450 --> 15:52.083
Completed!

15:52.116 --> 15:54.450
With the untainted energy
within this sphere,

15:54.483 --> 15:56.466
I will be able to power

15:57.000 --> 15:58.400
the universe!

15:58.433 --> 16:03.016
Echoing: The universe!
The universe!

16:03.050 --> 16:05.116
Oh, boy!
He's at it
again!

16:05.150 --> 16:07.300
Don't worry.
His sister will
come by later

16:07.333 --> 16:09.016
and ruin
everything.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.133
You said it,
brother.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.366
Mom: Dexter!

16:12.400 --> 16:13.466
Breakfast is ready!

16:14.000 --> 16:14.483
But first,

16:15.016 --> 16:17.216
I got to get me
some grub!

16:17.250 --> 16:19.183
Here you go, honey.

16:19.216 --> 16:21.466
Now, eat everything
on your plate,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.333
and remember,
it's flu season.

16:24.366 --> 16:26.400
If you don't keep
up your strength,

16:26.433 --> 16:30.166
you can catch a...A...

16:30.200 --> 16:31.466
[Ah-choo]

16:41.316 --> 16:45.216
Eew! Germs!

16:47.116 --> 16:50.000
Whoa, son.
Where's the fire?

16:50.033 --> 16:52.400
[Coughing]

16:56.116 --> 17:00.100
Too much exertion
breaks down
your reserve.

17:00.133 --> 17:03.250
[Coughing]

17:03.283 --> 17:05.250
Slow down there,
partner.

17:05.283 --> 17:07.366
It's flu season,
you know.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.216
Hi, Dexter.

17:12.350 --> 17:16.316
I think I may be
coming down
with something.

17:16.350 --> 17:18.400
[Ah-choo]

17:18.433 --> 17:21.216
[Laughing sickly]

17:21.250 --> 17:22.100
Ah!

17:22.133 --> 17:23.116
Stay away from me!

17:23.150 --> 17:27.400
Dee Dee: But, Dexter,
I was looking for my hanky.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.000
I kind of need it.

17:29.033 --> 17:30.233
But I don't know
where it is.

17:30.266 --> 17:34.350
Oh, I think I left it
in your lab.

17:34.383 --> 17:36.200
The lab!

17:54.183 --> 17:55.216
Computer,

17:55.250 --> 17:58.300

18:00.100 --> 18:01.000
Computer: Searching.

18:01.033 --> 18:04.466
Entire laboratory

18:11.283 --> 18:17.216
Quickly, computer,
engage antibacterial
environmental bubble!

18:18.216 --> 18:21.200
Computer: System engaged.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.100

the lab.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.083

18:34.116 --> 18:36.166
Incoming germ manifestation

18:36.200 --> 18:38.100

18:38.316 --> 18:40.216
Dexter, I'm serious.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.200
I need to find
my hanky.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.150
Ah...ah...ah...

18:45.183 --> 18:46.450

18:48.016 --> 18:49.183

19:12.016 --> 19:15.416
I got to find

19:15.450 --> 19:20.100
Hanky! Where are you?

19:20.133 --> 19:22.050
Hanky!

19:22.083 --> 19:23.466
Dexter: Dee Dee!

19:24.000 --> 19:25.466
Hanky!

19:26.000 --> 19:28.150
Dee Dee, you take
your revolting germs

19:28.183 --> 19:29.466
and get out
of my laboratory.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.433
You are infecting
my whole lab.
