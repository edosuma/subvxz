00:17.684 --> 00:18.560
[James] When we asked,

00:18.643 --> 00:21.521
"Do you believe career politicians
like Dede Standish have done a good job

00:21.604 --> 00:26.443
representing the 27th District in Albany?"
it was 33 percent yes, 38 percent no,

00:26.526 --> 00:27.652
14 undecided,

00:27.736 --> 00:28.945
15 no opinion.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.156
-That's very good.
-Meaning bad for her, good for us.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.366
Yep, I gathered that.
Totally did not need to clarify.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.325
But when we asked,

00:34.409 --> 00:36.453
"Do you believe
Payton Hobart has the experience

00:36.536 --> 00:38.538
to represent the 27th District in Albany?"

00:38.621 --> 00:40.540
it dropped to a 21 percent yes,

00:40.623 --> 00:41.750
44 percent no,

00:41.833 --> 00:44.210
22 undecided, and 13 no opinion.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.004
Okay,
but that's a very different question.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.423
Hold on. That's the same thing,
"undecided" and "no opinion."

00:48.506 --> 00:49.674
No, it's not.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.889
I've done so much glad-handing

00:55.972 --> 00:58.391
that we've spent half
of our campaign budget on hand sanitizer.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.393
Are you just gonna let all this spill out,
or...?

01:00.477 --> 01:03.021
So, why are we ten-something points down
with a month to go?

01:03.104 --> 01:05.148
Dede Standish
has 30 years of name recognition.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.441
It's all about turnout.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.654
Turnout in elections
for New York State Senate

01:11.738 --> 01:12.947
tend to be as low as 2 percent.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.159
As few as 6,000 people
will even cast their ballots,

01:16.242 --> 01:18.912
which means this race can be determined
on, like, 100 votes.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.955
You could win
if you just go after those people

01:21.039 --> 01:22.791
who've answered the poll
with "I don't know."

01:22.874 --> 01:24.918
And we know who they are.
We have their phone numbers.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.337
There weren't any "I don't knows"!

01:27.420 --> 01:28.546
[Payton] That's right, James,

01:28.630 --> 01:31.549
because you asked everyone for
their opinions in a really confusing way.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
-Maybe I'll just get us coffees, then.
-Thank you.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.638
The reason why
we are ten-something points behind

01:36.721 --> 01:39.641
and not ten-something points ahead
is because you have a nuclear bomb

01:39.724 --> 01:43.103
with the word "throuple" written on it,
and you refuse to drop it, okay?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.480
See, that's the thing
with a nuclear bomb, James.

01:45.563 --> 01:48.024
It's not a very good look
for the side that drops it, okay?

01:48.108 --> 01:51.111
I won't run a dirty campaign
that attacks my opponent's personal life.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.445
I am the ideas candidate.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.532
Well, then you'd better get used to
the idea that we are going to lose.

Maybe instead of coffee,
I'll just see you all tomorrow?

Uh, okay. Andrew...?

03:38.384 --> 03:40.303
No last name. Just Andrew.

they don't even hear me.

And it's not an accident.
They're actively not listening.

I've been dealing with that my whole life.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.486
which is why I also brought you

11:35.569 --> 11:37.488
these marijuana gummies

11:38.114 --> 11:41.283
and this miniature margarita kit.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.618
[both chuckling]

11:43.411 --> 11:45.579
And I'm also wearing
very provocative undergarments.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.249
-You're so good to me.
-Mm.

11:50.501 --> 11:51.669
I love you.

11:51.752 --> 11:55.548
I didn't run out on my wedding
just to be with you for the good times.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.801
For better or worse.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.971
In sickness and in health, and...

12:03.180 --> 12:05.891
-[voice breaks] ...all that.
-I know you're anxious for me to propose.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.101
[laughs softly]

12:09.061 --> 12:11.647
[clears throat] The last thing
I want to be is a distraction.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.899
Why? Come here.
You're the opposite of that, okay?

12:14.567 --> 12:17.820
And we are going to get married
as soon as this campaign's over.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.158
-Assuming you'll wanna marry a loser.
-Stop that right now.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.244
And stop listening to James and McAfee

12:25.327 --> 12:27.163
and their poll-tested ideas.

12:27.371 --> 12:29.248
I've been doing some of my own polling.

12:29.331 --> 12:32.752
Your climate-change ideas
are really resonating with new voters,

12:32.835 --> 12:35.087
-young voters.
-Thank you.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.380
They're the key.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.634
[sighing] They're a mirage, okay?
The white whale of politics.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.677
Campaigns chase them,

12:41.761 --> 12:43.888
but the stats don't lie.
Young people don't vote.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.474
Twenty percent of eligible voters
18-25 actually vote.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.976
They get all fired up, right?
About the guns and,

12:49.059 --> 12:51.854
you know, climate change
and economic inequality.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.982
And then, they just sit around,
drinking lattes on Wednesday morning,

12:55.065 --> 12:56.942
saying,
"Oh, wasn't the election yesterday?"

12:57.026 --> 12:58.986
Okay, stop making things complicated.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.531
One issue:

13:03.949 --> 13:04.825
the climate.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.495
Hit it hard, over and over.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.413
That's how you're going to win.

13:10.956 --> 13:11.874
You're so smart,

13:12.750 --> 13:14.168
and I'm so in love with you.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.796
And I know what I have to do
to win this race:

13:17.505 --> 13:19.590
go to LA
and get my mom to drop out of hers.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.844
[boat horn blares]

13:23.928 --> 13:26.514
[Payton] My mother returned from Bhutan
with a new sense of purpose.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.766
She was penniless from her divorce,

13:28.849 --> 13:32.019
but she found her renewed purpose
as the top fundraiser and de facto leader

13:32.102 --> 13:34.188
-of a program called "Oceana 2."
-[buoy clangs]

13:34.814 --> 13:37.233
Their mission is to catch dolphins,
one by one,

13:37.316 --> 13:40.820
and carefully operate to remove plastics
from their digestive tracts.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.031
My mom found out
about Oceana 2 from Infinity.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.951
Infinity had become
quietly passionate about the environment

13:47.034 --> 13:48.118
during her book tour.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.288
She even considered changing her last name
to "Degrees"

13:51.580 --> 13:53.749
to bring attention
to the ever-warming climate.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.086
Her and my mom had been
Instagram buddies for a couple of years,

13:57.169 --> 13:59.338
so when my mom was looking
for a way to get involved

13:59.421 --> 14:01.507
with fighting climate change,
Infinity was happy

14:01.590 --> 14:03.259
to make all the necessary introductions.

14:03.342 --> 14:06.136
It was in her capacity as fund-raiser
that my mother found herself

14:06.220 --> 14:08.973
at billionaire Alison Mendelsohn's
Malibu mansion

14:09.265 --> 14:11.684
for a Game of Thrones finale
viewing party.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.853
Alison was a huge Game of Thrones fan.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.480
-Her opinion of the final episodes was...
-[screams]

14:17.106 --> 14:18.482
...less than enthusiastic.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.611
Mom falls in love almost as easily
as she falls out of it.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.113
She and Alison became inseparable.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.866
[Alison] I understand that she'd lost
everyone important to her

14:26.949 --> 14:29.910
when Ser Jorah and Missandei
and the other dragon died,

14:30.202 --> 14:32.705
but are they saying that every woman
who goes through a hard time

14:32.788 --> 14:35.332
-goes completely psycho?
-Can we talk about something else?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.878
We are in a climate emergency!

14:40.212 --> 14:42.840
California emission standards
are being threatened.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.175
Our agribusinesses can't find workers.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.220
Wildfire season is year-round.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.057
And manufacturers are abusing
our lax organic-labeling laws.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.019
You're constantly complaining
about this stuff.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.313
Why don't you just run for governor?

14:59.899 --> 15:00.941
You know what?

15:01.775 --> 15:02.610
I will.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.990
[overlapping chatter]

15:08.616 --> 15:10.534
[Payton] She was ahead in the polls
within moments

15:10.618 --> 15:12.536
-of announcing her candidacy.
-[man] That's great.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.080
So, I said to Kissinger, "That's okay,

15:15.205 --> 15:17.833
Princess Margaret and I aren't wearing
any underwear either."

15:17.917 --> 15:19.919
-[laughter]
-[Payton] Men loved her, women loved her:

15:20.002 --> 15:22.838
rich, poor, liberal, conservative.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.966
When my mother shines her light on you,
it feels like all is right in the world.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.427
At that moment, she was shining that light
across the entirety

15:28.510 --> 15:29.803
of the great state of California.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.514
Between her natural abilities
and Alison's bottomless pockets,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.059
your mom is sucking up
all of the Hobart political oxygen.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.103
It isn't just the press or the pundits.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.605
The people love her.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.150
Every time I talk to a reporter,
they just ask about her.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.153
And-- And when we send
those "get out the vote" e-mails,

15:46.236 --> 15:47.529
over half the responses are:

15:47.613 --> 15:49.615
"Why am I getting this?
I can't vote in California."

15:49.698 --> 15:51.200
She's stealing my thunder.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.037
Am I a terrible son for doing this?

15:56.664 --> 15:59.291
Get going.
You're gonna miss your flight.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.669
And don't worry.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.214
When has she ever denied you
something you've asked of her? Hmm?

16:07.383 --> 16:10.844
[woman] Everyone, stand by. Ten seconds.
Please take your seats.

16:14.014 --> 16:17.393
In five, four, three, two...

16:17.476 --> 16:21.730
[man] Welcome to the first California
gubernatorial debate from CNN.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.149
[crowd applauding]

16:27.361 --> 16:29.113
[scattered cheering]

16:31.365 --> 16:33.117
Welcome. We have two hours.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.536
Still, I'd like to get right into it.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.788
Uh, Assemblyman Andrich,
I'd like to start with you.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.582
Forty-five percent of state revenue
in California

16:40.666 --> 16:43.002
comes from the top 1 percent of earners.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.462
You're proposing a 30-percent tax cut

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
for that 1 percent,

16:46.922 --> 16:48.674
creating, by your own math,

16:48.757 --> 16:52.511
a budget shortfall of $500 billion.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.680
-How do you close that gap?
-[Andrich] First of all,

16:54.763 --> 16:58.767
Californians are some of the most taxed
human beings on the planet.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.937
And I wanna lower taxes
on middle-class families,

17:02.021 --> 17:04.231
who are the true engine
of the state's economy.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.983
Miss Hobart, would you care to respond?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.986
No, I don't. He's a creep,
and his poll numbers reflect that.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.821
[audience chuckles]

17:10.904 --> 17:13.365
All right, uh, Ms. Hobart,
uh, but let's stay with you.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.869
This week, you stated at a fundraiser
that you thought Californians should

17:16.952 --> 17:19.455
take time out of their day to, quote,

17:19.538 --> 17:20.831
"hug a tree."

17:21.290 --> 17:24.835
How do you respond to voters who think
your campaign is just not serious?

17:24.918 --> 17:28.422
Have you ever seen a redwood, Jake?
In person?

17:29.006 --> 17:33.010
Every human being who has ever seen
a redwood in real life

17:33.927 --> 17:36.597
has gone up to that tree and hugged it,

17:36.680 --> 17:38.682
and, for one fleeting moment,

17:39.266 --> 17:40.768
felt more grateful to be alive

17:40.851 --> 17:43.437
and more humble to be
in the state of California,

17:43.520 --> 17:45.147
one of the most beautiful places on earth.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.193
The people who think
my campaign is unserious

17:49.276 --> 17:51.070
are dishonest journalists

17:51.153 --> 17:54.073
who do not know me
and have made no attempt to contact me,

17:54.156 --> 17:57.826
and right-wing Republican
news organizations

17:57.910 --> 18:00.621
who've been engaged
in decades-long propaganda

18:00.704 --> 18:04.166
to divide this country
along any number of cultural lines,

18:04.249 --> 18:05.876
because they make a ton of money doing it.

18:05.959 --> 18:06.794
[applause]

18:06.877 --> 18:08.962
And they're good at it! They've won!

18:09.880 --> 18:12.091
We can't agree on policy in this country,

18:12.174 --> 18:14.176
because we can't agree on facts.

18:14.593 --> 18:15.928
Okay, I'd like to move on.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.180
And that's why I think California

18:18.764 --> 18:20.390
should secede from the Union.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.725
[audience murmuring]

18:22.476 --> 18:24.061
I'm sorry. Would you care to elaborate?

18:25.604 --> 18:30.150
California should be
its own independent country.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.739
Most of our federal tax dollars
go out of state

18:35.823 --> 18:38.283
to people who think
that we are pot-smoking,

18:38.367 --> 18:41.036
Satan-worshipping abortion doctors
or something.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.038
Who can't shut up

18:43.622 --> 18:47.167
about how our high taxes
are strangling the private sector.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.129
And yet, somehow,
California manages to remain

18:50.212 --> 18:51.088
the world leader

18:51.171 --> 18:52.756
in growth, industry,

18:52.840 --> 18:53.966
innovation, and culture.

18:54.049 --> 18:57.386
-[scattered applause]
-We have the best public-university system

18:57.886 --> 18:59.471
in the history of humankind.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.681
So maybe,

19:01.390 --> 19:04.935
just maybe, we are doing something right.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.980
And you have to ask yourself, eventually,

19:08.564 --> 19:10.482
"Are we ever gonna change their minds?

19:11.441 --> 19:13.026
Are we ever gonna change them?"

19:13.902 --> 19:14.736
No!

19:16.405 --> 19:19.158
This state is in a bad marriage.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.494
And what do you do
when you're in a bad marriage?

19:23.245 --> 19:24.621
You get a divorce.

19:25.664 --> 19:30.210
Sorry, Texas
and West Virginia and Alabama,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.546
I'm sure you're beautiful
deep down inside,

19:32.629 --> 19:34.923
-but we're moving on.
-[audience laughing]

19:36.008 --> 19:38.051
And New York, if you're listening,

19:38.802 --> 19:40.971
why don't you join us?
We'd make a great country.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.222
-[scattered cheers]
-Illinois?

19:42.306 --> 19:44.141
We'd be totally down for that too.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.477
And if you're watching at home

19:48.187 --> 19:49.897
and this sounds interesting to you,

19:49.980 --> 19:52.941
go to my website or use the hashtag

19:53.025 --> 19:55.777
"let's get the Cal outta here."

19:56.195 --> 19:57.154
Thank you.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.115
[audience cheering]

20:00.199 --> 20:01.575
Okay. Okay.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.619
Please, quiet down, everyone.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.245
[Jake continues indistinctly]

20:05.329 --> 20:07.456
No one's gonna go see a movie
that's just two hours

20:07.539 --> 20:09.583
of Sia silently making snacks.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.586
So, I see Mom got you two jobs
at Alison Mendelsohn's movie company?

20:12.669 --> 20:13.503
Yeah.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.797
She didn't mind
we don't have college degrees.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.884
Eh, don't judge us.
We're actually making a difference.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.137
-Also, I hear you're ten points down.
-[chuckling]

20:22.221 --> 20:23.931
-For the moment.
-Yeah, good luck with that.

20:24.014 --> 20:27.100
Boys, are we really gonna continue
to poke at each other

20:27.184 --> 20:28.769
after all that we've been through?

20:29.186 --> 20:31.605
We've come out the other side
so much better.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.024
Payton has a new campaign,

20:34.441 --> 20:36.068
you boys are employed,

20:36.818 --> 20:38.820
I have a new love, a new passion.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.781
Can't say the same for Dad.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.160
Your father was actually
always very drawn to tradition and ritual,

20:45.244 --> 20:48.455
so I bet you this is the most settled
he's ever been in his life.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.165
Becoming an Orthodox Jew?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.709
Yes. I hear he married a lovely Jewess

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
who wears a wig, and they're very happy.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.338
Why don't you boys run along

20:56.421 --> 20:58.382
so that Payton and I
can properly catch up?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.718
She never makes us sandwiches.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.638
[Georgina] Agh.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.640
You look wonderful.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.017
Isn't Alison great?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.520
I mean,
I know she's a little single-minded,

21:11.603 --> 21:12.729
but all great women are.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.690
Mom, I need you to end your campaign.

21:16.066 --> 21:16.900
What?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.319
But I'm going to win.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.029
Yes, and I am going to lose.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.282
Your candidacy is killing my dream.

21:23.824 --> 21:27.661
But... is it my fault
that you're ten points behind?

21:27.744 --> 21:30.163
Mom, I love you,
but you are a distraction.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.667
I'm this big, bright star standing
right next to the sun.

21:34.084 --> 21:34.918
In broad daylight.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.297
Well, then,
you're gonna need to shine brighter,

21:38.380 --> 21:39.506
not ask me to dim.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.009
But I've tried everything.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.011
You haven't tried being yourself.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.888
I'm a politician. I have no self.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.642
Well, then, you're gonna have to find one
that's authentic as possible

21:50.726 --> 21:52.227
so that voters believe that you do.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.106
People don't believe you
because you don't believe you.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.733
Maybe I'm not even good at this.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.192
You know?

21:59.443 --> 22:02.029
Maybe our privileged upbringing
gave me a false sense of confidence.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.865
What if--
What if I'm no different than the twins?

22:06.700 --> 22:11.121
Honey, those boys are Ferraris
with golf-cart engines.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.333
You are the real deal.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.960
You're just driving
in the wrong direction.

22:17.544 --> 22:18.712
How can you be so sure?

22:19.504 --> 22:22.758
Because I'm your mother,
and I know you better than anyone.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.803
It's about authenticity, Payton, okay?

22:27.304 --> 22:28.722
Okay. [sighs]

22:30.223 --> 22:31.767
[Andrew]
I'm here to see Hadassah Gold.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.810
-And who are you?
-Andrew.

22:33.894 --> 22:34.895
I wanna be an intern.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.273
Well, okay.
If you'd like to fill out an application,

22:38.357 --> 22:39.816
why don't you go somewhere else?

22:39.900 --> 22:42.027
Because we don't hire interns.

22:42.110 --> 22:42.944
Hmm.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.573
I saw the way you looked me up and down.
You othered me.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.202
Are you aware that the width
of the doorway I just walked through

22:50.285 --> 22:53.080
is not compliant
with the Americans with Disabilities Act?

22:53.163 --> 22:56.541
Well, you made it just fine,
so congratulations.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.252
Let me read to you
from the subchapter on employment.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.004
Great, and while you do that,

23:01.088 --> 23:04.508
I'm just gonna rub the side
of my nose here with my middle finger.

23:04.591 --> 23:05.509
Just hold right there.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.386
I'm going to take a picture of you...

23:07.469 --> 23:08.887
-[clicks]
-...and then tweet it

23:08.970 --> 23:09.930
with the word "bigot"

23:10.013 --> 23:12.599
to the American Association
of People with Disabilities.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.185
Holy fuck, you little shit.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.938
I'm gonna get you
in to Hadassah right now.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.065
Bitch is gonna tear you a new one.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.151
So, I graduated in June,
with a BA in mathematics--

23:23.235 --> 23:24.945
I'm gonna stop you right there.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.614
I don't know what you said to Sherry,

23:28.031 --> 23:29.199
but she hates you,

23:29.449 --> 23:31.493
which brightens my day immensely.

23:31.576 --> 23:35.455
Ha! You're hired. [chuckling]
You're gonna be my Sherry whisperer.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.999
And by whisperer, I mean tormentor. Ugh!

23:38.417 --> 23:40.252
What a bitch. [chuckles]

23:40.335 --> 23:41.169
Okay, great.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.464
And a math major, huh? Fantastic!

23:44.548 --> 23:46.550
We're bringing in
all this new IT bullshit,

23:46.633 --> 23:48.593
brand-new computers, a whole data team.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.346
That's what campaigns
are all about these days, evidently.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.266
Uh, thank you, Ms. Gold.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.518
This is a dream come true.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.228
Find yourself a desk somewhere.
[chuckles]

24:01.314 --> 24:02.607
[exhales, shudders]

24:03.733 --> 24:05.735
Well, hello.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.863
I thought about it, and I'm in.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.575
-I love the cloak-and-dagger routine.
-I'll do it on one condition.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.952
When I run for office,
whenever that may be,

24:14.035 --> 24:15.162
you run my campaign.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.622
-Sounds fun. I like it.
-Good.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.459
So, you have a problem.
Your candidate's in a throuple.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.504
[stammers] I beg your pardon?

24:24.588 --> 24:25.839
A three-way relationship.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.341
And Payton knows about it.
So, you should get on that.

24:32.512 --> 24:35.390
So, how is the campaign going?
I see you're well ahead.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.685
Well, that's what Hadassah tells me,
and, um...

24:39.102 --> 24:40.937
honestly, it's old hat, at this point.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.483
[stammers] This is, like,
my 12th or 13th campaign.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.484
[both laugh]

24:45.567 --> 24:47.986
Yeah, but the kid is
only ten points behind you.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.907
Yes, sure. I mean-- I mean, look...

24:52.908 --> 24:56.786
there are a lot of people in my district
that aren't that engaged.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.372
All they only ever want to do
is lodge a protest vote

24:59.456 --> 25:00.832
saying, "F the system."

25:00.916 --> 25:04.628
And, you know, here's this fetus,
and then there are a lot of young people

25:04.711 --> 25:07.339
who are very excited
about the idea of somebody like that.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.299
You know how it is.
It's part of the landscape.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.094
But see, that's what worries me.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.515
Senator, you're-- you're worried?

25:16.640 --> 25:17.933
The people you're talking about,

25:18.016 --> 25:20.560
the ones who get excited
about voting for a kid.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.524
At reelection, that slice of the pie
is getting bigger and bigger.

25:26.274 --> 25:27.317
And your voters,

25:27.692 --> 25:31.446
the ones who cast a ballot
in every election for the past 40 years,

25:32.322 --> 25:34.241
I hate to say it, but they're dying off.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.494
I'm sorry.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.666
-Are you suggesting that I'm too old?
-Oh, come on.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.876
Because I thought that's
what drew you to me:

25:44.960 --> 25:47.295
my pragmatism, my experience,

25:47.379 --> 25:49.923
to make up for the fact that you...

25:50.674 --> 25:53.218
haven't been doing this for very long.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.346
I'm saying it could be used against us.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.932
When I look at your campaign,

25:59.015 --> 26:01.226
who's running it, the slogans, you...

26:01.851 --> 26:03.645
it reeks of old politics.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.607
And it's not me who's smelling it.
It's the 20 percent of your constituency

26:07.691 --> 26:11.278
who would rather vote for a kid
than vote for you.

26:11.361 --> 26:15.865
You can't let this kid get closer to you
than ten points.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.075
If he does,

26:17.158 --> 26:20.996
I'm gonna have serious questions
about your viability as a running mate.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.540
Dede, we have a family emergency.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.709
Hi, Senator, so sorry to interrupt.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.043
You need to come with me.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.963
I'll-- I'll call you, Senator.
Where are we going?

26:30.046 --> 26:31.131
To your house.

26:31.214 --> 26:33.258
-What the hell is happening?
-Shut your fucking mouth.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.676
I know about the throuple.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.596
How did you think
you were gonna get away with this?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.473
I don't know
whether to be furious or betrayed.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.518
And then I'm like,
"Hadassah, why should you have to choose?"

26:43.602 --> 26:45.729
Can we just lower the temperature in here
for a second?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.439
You lower the temperature, Marcus!

26:47.522 --> 26:48.732
Or if it's too hot in here,

26:48.815 --> 26:51.401
why don't the three of you all
just take off your clothes?

26:52.777 --> 26:55.030
-[Dede] You're sure that they know?
-Yes, I'm sure.

26:55.113 --> 26:56.823
It was one of their staffers who told me.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.617
That's how I found out.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.620
Instead of from one of the actual members
of the throuple,

27:01.703 --> 27:03.079
which is what should've happened.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.373
Okay, but as far as we know,
no one else knows.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.417
Yeah, and how long
do you think that's gonna last?

27:07.500 --> 27:08.793
[takes ragged breath]

27:08.877 --> 27:10.170
Why didn't you tell me?

27:12.464 --> 27:17.427
[stammering] Hadassah, this was always
a personal and private matter.

27:17.552 --> 27:19.763
We-- We thought the best way
for it to remain a secret

27:19.846 --> 27:22.974
-was if only the three of us knew.
-Honestly, I thought you knew.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.934
-You what?
-[Marcus] Yeah.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.102
No.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.270
I didn't know.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.397
I thought he was your great friend
or something.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.358
Or maybe you were a little gay
or whatever.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.152
Or maybe the two of you
had something going on on the side,

27:34.235 --> 27:38.198
but never in my life did I imagine
that the three of you-- What? What?

27:38.281 --> 27:41.326
[stammers]
You pushed two queen-sized beds together

27:41.409 --> 27:43.411
and daisy-chained each other to sleep
every night?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.788
Hey! If you're gonna be rude--

27:44.871 --> 27:46.247
Get used to it, pal.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.291
Shit's gonna get real rude

27:48.375 --> 27:51.002
when this is a blind item
on Page Six one day,

27:51.086 --> 27:53.129
and the next, it's splashed
over the front pages

27:53.213 --> 27:54.589
of every newspaper on earth!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.299
-Hadassah!
-[Hadassah panting]

27:56.383 --> 27:58.843
This is manageable.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.095
Oh, no, Dede,

28:00.762 --> 28:03.348
vehicular manslaughter is manageable.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.267
This... is batshit!

28:06.351 --> 28:08.561
That's what I mean! If it does come out--

28:08.645 --> 28:11.189
we don't even know if it will--
we just deny, deny, deny.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.733
Because, frankly, it does sound like
some cockamamie, far-right,

28:13.817 --> 28:16.319
Republican talking point
that oozed out of the lunatic fringe

28:16.403 --> 28:20.115
like-- like a pedophile ring being run
out of a DC pizza parlor,

28:20.198 --> 28:22.075
or Antonin Scalia getting murdered.

28:22.158 --> 28:25.537
Here, you and I know just about

28:25.620 --> 28:29.040
every political journalist in New York
by name,

28:29.124 --> 28:30.583
and if they got a blind item

28:30.667 --> 28:32.627
that Dede Standish was in a throuple,

28:32.711 --> 28:34.003
that a woman over 40

28:34.087 --> 28:37.257
had even an ounce of sexual allure
or desire...

28:37.340 --> 28:39.718
which they don't think we do,
and they are wrong...

28:39.801 --> 28:41.886
-[groans]
-...they would just--

28:41.970 --> 28:44.514
they would die laughing
before they could run it by their editor.

28:44.597 --> 28:47.183
And even if they look,
they won't find anything.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.895
I mean, we've been in public
a few times together, but that's it.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.064
You asked how we thought
we could get away with this.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.359
Well, we've been getting away with this
for ten years!

28:56.693 --> 28:57.694
Do they have proof?

28:57.777 --> 29:00.155
Do they have a salacious photo or a video?

29:00.238 --> 29:02.741
A video? Oh, my God. [panting]

29:02.824 --> 29:03.783
You do videos?

29:04.075 --> 29:06.619
No, no, no. Of course we don't do videos.

29:06.703 --> 29:07.746
Oh, thank God.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.748
[Hadassah exhales]

29:10.832 --> 29:13.126
No, no, it was the staffer.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.420
She told me she saw you--
you three kissing,

29:15.503 --> 29:17.088
which... [groans]

29:17.172 --> 29:20.300
-...just the mental picture.
-So, one mistake, once.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.761
And we knew it. We talked about it
in the limo on the way home

29:22.844 --> 29:24.554
-as we were all making out...
-Making out.

29:24.637 --> 29:25.722
Oh, Jesus Christ!

29:25.805 --> 29:28.767
[Marcus] ...and swore that this
would never happen again.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.059
That's the night we get caught.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.687
Right, but it's just an image
in some girl's head.

29:32.771 --> 29:36.024
It's a memory of what she thinks she saw.
She has no proof.

29:36.107 --> 29:37.609
It'll just be her word.

29:39.652 --> 29:40.487
Come on.

29:44.365 --> 29:47.827
Look, I know this is not ideal,

29:48.495 --> 29:52.457
and I'm sorry that we kept it from you.

29:52.540 --> 29:56.920
[stammers] I understand that you feel
that we betrayed your trust, and...

29:57.003 --> 29:59.422
[stutters] ...I, and--
We're gonna do everything

29:59.923 --> 30:01.508
to gain your trust back again.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.176
No.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.139
It's me or him.

30:09.557 --> 30:11.392
You two end this tonight,

30:11.476 --> 30:14.270
or I walk, and I walk forever.

30:14.979 --> 30:16.815
Like a fucking Jewish Highlander.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.112
We'll discuss it and get back to you.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.658
No, Dede, you never see him again,

30:26.866 --> 30:28.451
you never speak to him again.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.454
Look,
I'm sure you're a very nice pivot man,

30:32.038 --> 30:33.039
but it's over, okay?

30:38.002 --> 30:38.837
No.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.131
It isn't over.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.383
[breath trembling]

30:43.466 --> 30:48.263
I am not giving up the best thing
in my life

30:48.346 --> 30:53.268
just because some 22-year-old
fucking rich kid

30:53.351 --> 30:54.894
thinks he has something on me!

30:54.978 --> 30:59.023
You idiot. I don't give a shit
about Payton Hobart.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.735
It's Tino I care about. Tino.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.114
What is gonna happen
when he gets wind of this?

31:06.197 --> 31:07.574
What do you think he's gonna do?

31:08.533 --> 31:11.536
You're not gonna become
the vice president of the United States.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.705
The ship has sailed, Dede.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.999
Sailed.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.098
[Dede] No, no. No, no, no.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.101
-Mm.
-[door opens, shuts]

31:35.184 --> 31:38.897
Well, this is what I call
coming to your senses.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.941
Keep it up.

31:56.539 --> 31:57.624
So, what is this again?

31:57.707 --> 31:59.709
[McAfee] Infinity's thing,
Rally for Climate Action.

31:59.792 --> 32:00.793
[James] I don't get it.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.170
What's Infinity's deal?

32:02.253 --> 32:05.256
I thought she was a best-selling author.
Now she's a climate activist?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.592
Yeah, what a bitch, right?
How dare she use her notoriety

32:07.675 --> 32:10.887
to raise awareness about the greatest
long-term threat to human civilization?

32:10.970 --> 32:13.056
You're an ass. Here's your speech.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.267
[crowd cheering]

32:16.392 --> 32:17.435
[Infinity] Okay.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.438
And it is now

32:20.521 --> 32:23.358
my pleasure to introduce
a dear friend of mine

32:23.441 --> 32:27.070
who's running for state senate,
which is totally a thing,

32:28.071 --> 32:29.739
Payton Hobart!

32:29.822 --> 32:31.574
[cheering]

32:31.658 --> 32:32.575
I don't need this.

32:33.159 --> 32:33.993
What?

32:34.327 --> 32:35.870
[cheers continue]

32:35.954 --> 32:36.871
Hello, Infinity.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.207
-Thanks for being here.
-Thanks for having me.

32:40.041 --> 32:40.917
Thank you to Infinity!

32:44.087 --> 32:46.631
You know, Infinity and I, uh,
we went to high school together.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.425
-Uh, she was my running mate, actually.
-True.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.927
And can I tell you what my first act

32:51.010 --> 32:52.845
-as student body president was?
-[all] Yeah!

32:52.929 --> 32:53.888
It was real simple:

32:54.097 --> 32:57.225
to ban the use of plastic straws
on campus, right?

32:57.308 --> 32:58.977
-[cheering]
-[chuckles] Yes!

32:59.060 --> 33:01.145
Yes, like you,
I thought it was a total no-brainer.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.898
It's a-- It's a concrete solution
we can implement overnight

33:03.982 --> 33:05.900
that would make
a significant environmental impact

33:05.984 --> 33:08.069
and would show the world
our generation's commitment

33:08.152 --> 33:10.530
-to protecting the environment.
-Yeah!

33:10.613 --> 33:13.241
But when I presented this plan
to the school board,

33:13.324 --> 33:15.451
-I was laughed out of the room.
-[crowd booing]

33:15.535 --> 33:16.869
They called me naive.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.622
They called the plan "outlandish."

33:19.706 --> 33:22.083
They admitted that it was
the right thing to do,

33:22.166 --> 33:23.751
but they said it just couldn't be done.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.879
This is exactly what our generation
is dealing with, friends.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.840
These are the adults in the room,

33:28.923 --> 33:31.259
and they don't even have the backbone
to take on straws?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.636
[booing]

33:35.304 --> 33:38.683
Now, listen. Every one of us here today
knows that we are in a generational fight

33:38.766 --> 33:41.436
that will determine our species' future
on this planet.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.731
But politicians like Dede Standish...

33:44.814 --> 33:46.774
[crowd boos]

33:46.858 --> 33:49.235
...they cannot accept our urgency
to clean up this mess,

33:49.318 --> 33:51.195
because if they did,
they would have to admit

33:51.279 --> 33:52.739
that they are the ones who made it!

33:52.822 --> 33:54.699
[cheering]

33:54.782 --> 33:58.202
Well, Senator Standish,
if you are listening today,

33:58.286 --> 34:00.830
I do not want my children
and my grandchildren

34:00.913 --> 34:03.041
living in a New York City
with 20-foot sea walls

34:03.124 --> 34:06.210
holding back a dying ocean
on a scorched Earth

34:06.294 --> 34:08.921
with tens of millions
of climate refugees...

34:09.005 --> 34:11.174
-No. No.
-...and fascist governments

34:11.257 --> 34:12.091
around the globe

34:12.175 --> 34:13.509
are committing wholesale genocide

34:13.593 --> 34:16.220
while we fight for dwindling supplies
of food and water!

34:16.304 --> 34:17.597
[crowd cheering]

34:17.680 --> 34:20.141
That is where this world is headed
if we continue to do nothing,

34:20.224 --> 34:23.686
Dede Standish. And when you say
that we can't afford to take action,

34:23.770 --> 34:26.314
I say this:
It's because of your generation's policies

34:26.397 --> 34:28.399
that my generation has no other choice!

34:28.483 --> 34:29.734
[cheering]

34:30.151 --> 34:32.612
-Amazing. He's amazing.
-[Payton] Thank you very much!

34:33.488 --> 34:36.449
But, my friends, we do have one choice,
and that's on Election Day.

34:36.532 --> 34:39.077
You, all of you, each and every one of you

34:39.160 --> 34:40.870
who has voted with your feet today,

34:40.953 --> 34:43.206
by showing the world
where your priorities lie,

34:43.289 --> 34:46.375
you have the chance on November 5th

34:46.459 --> 34:49.629
to preserve humanity's future
on this planet and in this city.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.090
You. You are the solution.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.092
Our generation is gonna save this planet,

34:54.175 --> 34:57.095
and I'm going to do everything
in my power to help you do so!

34:57.178 --> 34:58.262
Thank you very much!

34:58.346 --> 35:00.056
-[cheering]
-Unbelievable!

35:04.852 --> 35:05.937
[phone dings]

35:07.688 --> 35:08.856
This is being livestreamed.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.775
[cheering continues]

35:14.153 --> 35:16.322
-That was good.
-This is gonna go viral.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.950
I liked that. [chuckles]
Let's do more of that.

35:21.702 --> 35:25.581
[horn blows]

35:34.549 --> 35:36.926
[man]
It doesn't exist. The albino lobster?

35:37.009 --> 35:37.844
It's a legend.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.972
They say it's one-in-a-hundred-million
chance that you find one.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.932
Better chance of winning
the Mega Millions.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.767
Well, which is it? Does it not exist,

35:44.851 --> 35:46.519
or is it a one-in-a-hundred-million
chance?

35:46.602 --> 35:48.271
Can I give you some advice?

35:48.354 --> 35:50.606
Maybe it's not the white lobster
you're looking for.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.109
-Maybe it's something else.
-Like a blue lobster?

35:53.192 --> 35:56.571
No. Like, maybe the white lobster
represents what you really want

35:56.654 --> 35:57.697
but you can't have.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.448
But you're looking for the lobster

35:59.532 --> 36:01.617
so you don't have
to think about the real thing.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.411
I've actually seen a blue lobster.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.288
Pretty rare.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.123
I love someone, okay?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.875
Two someones,

36:08.958 --> 36:10.126
and I can't have them.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.336
That's why I ran away
to work on a lobster boat,

36:12.420 --> 36:14.213
so I don't have to think about them.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.341
So I don't have to think about anything.
So, please, stop talking to me!

36:17.425 --> 36:19.427
[thumping music plays nearby]

36:21.762 --> 36:24.724
[Alison] Can't you at least pretend
not to hate everyone here?

36:25.266 --> 36:27.685
Why pretend in a room full of fakes?

36:28.352 --> 36:30.938
They're never going to tell you
what they really think, anyway.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.192
These are voters
from every Hollywood guild and academy.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.445
Why are my voters so awful
and yours are so perfect?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.030
The difference is this:

36:39.113 --> 36:40.740
I want to help my voters,

36:40.823 --> 36:42.783
and you want your voters to help you.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.247
[groans softly]

36:50.750 --> 36:53.377
Old-fashioned, not too sweet, right?

36:53.711 --> 36:56.339
-Yes. Uh, that or--
-Martini up. Extra olives.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.010
I have the top oppo researchers
in the game.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.887
-[Georgina chuckles]
-I'm Tino McCutcheon,

37:03.054 --> 37:05.223
junior senator
for the great state of Texas.

37:05.306 --> 37:06.474
[Georgina] Mmm!

37:06.682 --> 37:08.809
Yes, I believe I've seen you
on television.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.020
Were you doing some sort of triathlon?

37:11.687 --> 37:13.189
Well, between you and I,

37:13.272 --> 37:16.442
I'm positioning myself
for a presidential run next year.

37:16.734 --> 37:20.905
My advisers feel it's wise to lean into
my virility and sex appeal, so...

37:21.364 --> 37:24.951
a shirtless politician
produces millions in free advertising.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.452
I'll keep that in mind.

37:26.535 --> 37:27.495
[laughs]

37:28.037 --> 37:29.413
So, what brings you here?

37:29.497 --> 37:31.207
Fundraising? I hope not.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.668
These limousine liberals
are full of passion

37:33.751 --> 37:35.753
until you ask them to write a check.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.339
Not exactly. I have a proposal for you.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.007
I'm seeing someone...

37:41.384 --> 37:42.385
I think.

37:43.719 --> 37:45.137
Not that kind of proposal.

37:46.889 --> 37:49.141
My wife slipped into a coma two years ago.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.852
Complications from
a severe case of trichinosis.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.479
They don't know if she'll ever wake up,

37:53.562 --> 37:56.524
and even if she does,
there will most certainly be brain damage.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.483
[Georgina sighs]

37:57.566 --> 38:00.361
Well, you're a very good husband
for staying by her side.

38:00.444 --> 38:04.573
My husband slipped into a coma for a week,
and I was one foot out the door.

38:04.657 --> 38:05.574
[Tino chuckles]

38:05.658 --> 38:08.411
Well, I hate to say it,
but it's been great for me, politically.

38:08.494 --> 38:09.328
Uh...

38:09.704 --> 38:12.039
I've been paying attention
to your campaign.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.000
You have a gift.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.584
[Georgina] Well...

38:16.294 --> 38:19.130
people have always found me interesting,
for some reason.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.049
My father said you can't teach charisma.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.011
He would have known.
He was a great big fat man,

38:25.094 --> 38:26.804
and the ladies couldn't keep away.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.722
[Tino laughs]

38:27.805 --> 38:30.558
Yeah. Ideas don't win campaigns anymore.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.767
Values certainly don't.

38:31.851 --> 38:35.813
Nowadays, the guy who gets elected
is the guy who gets the most attention.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.025
P. T. Barnum would be our next president
if he were alive.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.444
I never liked the circus.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.820
Those poor elephants.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.406
I'm looking to make a splash

38:45.698 --> 38:47.908
and separate myself
from the other candidates

38:47.992 --> 38:50.828
by announcing my running mate early.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.789
I'd like to offer the position to you.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.167
Good Lord,

38:56.625 --> 38:57.793
that's a terrible idea.

38:57.877 --> 39:01.422
I-- I don't think I would play very well
in Iowa or Wisconsin.

39:01.505 --> 39:02.548
I'm a water sign.

39:02.631 --> 39:03.632
We don't need 'em.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.385
Just do the Electoral College math.

39:06.469 --> 39:10.264
If we take Texas, California,
Florida, Michigan, and New York,

39:10.348 --> 39:12.475
we can cobble together
enough of the forever-blue

39:12.558 --> 39:14.310
to make it to 270.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.688
The VP is a real job now.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.524
You could spearhead
my environmental campaign.

39:21.317 --> 39:22.193
And what is that?

39:23.152 --> 39:24.695
I don't have one yet.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.364
That's why I need you.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.033
Why else?

39:29.116 --> 39:30.701
Honestly, I don't know exactly.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.621
I just know I saw you at that debate,

39:34.705 --> 39:37.041
and I have not stopped
thinking about you since.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.670
Shall we go get a shrimp cocktail?

39:51.764 --> 39:52.640
All right.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.568
We tried it without you.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.113
And it was like clapping with one hand.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.534
-We love you, William.
-Well, I love you,

40:12.952 --> 40:15.788
which means I would never get in the way
of all your dreams coming true.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.873
I am so tired

40:18.082 --> 40:21.335
of having my personal life judged
by a different criteria

40:21.419 --> 40:22.628
because I'm a woman.

40:22.711 --> 40:27.466
If a man came out and proudly proclaimed
that he was in a polyamorous relationship

40:27.550 --> 40:30.052
with two brilliant and beautiful women,

40:30.136 --> 40:32.638
the public and the press
would call him a hero.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.140
Remember Warren Buffet?

40:34.223 --> 40:37.017
Wait, are you saying you--
you want to go public?

40:37.101 --> 40:39.186
No, no. Not-- Not yet.

40:41.355 --> 40:43.983
I need both of you to be my best self,

40:44.066 --> 40:48.154
and I need to be my best self
in order to win.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.783
I stink of lobster.

40:54.493 --> 40:55.494
[Dede laughs]

40:56.203 --> 40:57.204
Kiss me.

40:58.289 --> 41:01.292
And... melt me like butter.

41:01.792 --> 41:02.751
Mmm!

41:04.795 --> 41:06.964
[Dede and William groaning]

41:07.506 --> 41:09.842
[all groaning, laughing]

41:13.721 --> 41:14.722
Let's go.

41:16.724 --> 41:17.933
[Dede sighs]

41:20.144 --> 41:21.604
[Dede laughs]

41:26.942 --> 41:28.444
What does Morning Consult say?

41:28.527 --> 41:31.864
You've dropped another nine points.
Forty-eight percent her, 19 percent you,

41:31.947 --> 41:34.783
-the rest undecided.
-Okay, we need ideas, people, right now.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.285
[Andrew clears throat]

41:37.786 --> 41:40.372
-Hey, uh, now really isn't a good time.
-I have dirt.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.710
Sit down.
Everybody out, please. Clear the room.

41:45.127 --> 41:46.295
Clear the room. Thank you.

41:47.922 --> 41:48.797
[clears throat]

41:49.924 --> 41:51.342
First, I want your office.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.177
-What?
-Your office.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.094
I want it.

41:54.929 --> 41:56.013
F-- Fine.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.140
I don't know what happened,
who they hired,

41:58.224 --> 42:01.018
but the Standish campaign
is not stuck in the '90s anymore.

42:01.393 --> 42:03.354
They've installed state-of-the-art IT,

42:03.437 --> 42:05.814
they've hired a K-Street consulting firm,

42:06.273 --> 42:08.108
who's rented out
a whole floor for social media

42:08.192 --> 42:10.110
and another for the new data team.

42:10.569 --> 42:11.987
-We're fucked.
-How is that dirt?

42:12.071 --> 42:12.947
Patience.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.657
But I've gotten in deep.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.452
I gave Hadassah and Dede each
one of those little waving cats

42:18.536 --> 42:19.662
you get in Chinatown,

42:20.329 --> 42:23.415
but the little cats
are holding campaign signs.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.750
They loved them.

42:24.833 --> 42:27.962
Dede took two, one for her office
and one for her home.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.088
Oh, my God, you didn't.

42:30.464 --> 42:31.507
[Andrew] Yes, I did.

42:31.882 --> 42:34.301
Inside each cat is a wireless transmitter.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.804
-Yes, but then, what is he?
-[Andrew] I'm bugging them.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.223
And with the help
of my little Chinese kitten friends,

42:39.306 --> 42:40.432
I've learned two things--

42:40.516 --> 42:43.352
Okay, hold on, hold on. We are bugging
our political opponents now?

42:43.435 --> 42:45.604
Everybody remember how well that went
for Richard Nixon?

42:46.063 --> 42:46.897
Okay?

42:47.439 --> 42:50.192
Look, what-- whatever you found out,
I don't want to know.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.696
[Andrew] Oh, quit pretending you're not
as slimy as the rest of them.

42:53.779 --> 42:56.156
Do us all a favor and just embrace it.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.617
Hadassah broke up the throuple,

42:58.701 --> 43:00.411
but they're secretly still boning.

43:00.911 --> 43:01.745
Also,

43:02.162 --> 43:04.665
Dede Standish doesn't care
about this race.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.085
Tino McCutcheon is running for president,

43:08.168 --> 43:11.797
and he's considering her for VP.

43:16.969 --> 43:20.514
Also, I'd like $5,000 in cash
by the end of the day.

43:28.439 --> 43:31.025
[River]
Which of these do you think is most you?

43:31.108 --> 43:32.735
Spectacle over substance,

43:32.818 --> 43:34.486
or integrity über alles?

43:35.571 --> 43:37.573
Uh, which one sells more albums?

43:38.115 --> 43:39.199
That's my guy.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.952
Is this really gonna be
my eternal question: Who am I?

43:42.620 --> 43:43.954
Shouldn't I have that figured out?

43:44.622 --> 43:46.498
Am I jazz? Am I hip-hop?

43:47.124 --> 43:48.000
Opera?

43:48.876 --> 43:51.670
You know, my mother says
I need to be my authentic self to win,

43:51.754 --> 43:53.589
but I still have no idea what that is.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.841
-Are you winning?
-No.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.344
Then you're not being your authentic self.

43:59.261 --> 44:01.388
Okay, well, I shouldn't have to rely
on polling numbers

44:01.472 --> 44:03.599
to judge if I'm being
true to myself or not.

44:03.682 --> 44:05.351
That would make me a terrible person.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.854
Empty. Just completely unable
to have any sense of self

44:08.937 --> 44:11.440
without relying on outside influences.

44:11.523 --> 44:13.901
Or maybe it would just confirm you
as a true politician.

44:15.402 --> 44:16.862
Do you want to do good in the world?

44:16.945 --> 44:20.199
Is your motivation for governing
to empower the powerless?

44:20.282 --> 44:21.116
Yes!

44:21.617 --> 44:23.369
Doesn't sound like
a terrible person to me.

44:26.413 --> 44:29.458
I think you just need to stop
being so ashamed of wanting to win.

44:31.126 --> 44:33.337
It's time you stopped
seeing the world as binary.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.631
Right and wrong.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.257
Good and bad.

44:38.717 --> 44:39.635
Doesn't sound like you.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.054
I'm not me.

44:42.721 --> 44:45.599
I'm the little voice in your head
that helps you be you.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.935
And that true you

44:48.018 --> 44:49.228
changes over time.

44:50.854 --> 44:53.315
As you get older,
the world gets more complicated.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.360
You have to get more complicated too.

44:57.736 --> 44:59.571
Well, I can't change the world
if I don't win.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.579
So, how is not doing
everything in my power to win

45:07.663 --> 45:08.872
the decent thing to do?

45:09.373 --> 45:10.249
Huh?

45:10.874 --> 45:13.293
How could it be a sin to--
to destroy the powerful

45:13.377 --> 45:14.795
in order to lift up the powerless?

45:14.878 --> 45:15.713
Yeah.

45:17.840 --> 45:18.841
I'm a winner.

45:19.425 --> 45:22.010
That is-- That is my authentic self.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.012
Excuse me?

45:24.388 --> 45:26.390
Nothing. Sorry. I have to go.

45:34.773 --> 45:37.568
[Payton] There's a certain manner
in which I intended to run my campaign.

45:37.651 --> 45:41.572
You know, I-- I had an idea
of the candidate that I wanted to be.

45:41.864 --> 45:42.990
Very polite,

45:43.449 --> 45:47.619
stick to the issues, no dirty politics,
but, you know, I realized something.

45:47.703 --> 45:48.704
That's...

45:49.079 --> 45:51.749
That is just not me, right?

45:51.832 --> 45:55.043
I-- The authentic me had something
fall into his authentic lap.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.797
A lurid little story about
a certain candidate and her throuple.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.217
Now, the old Payton would've buried it,

46:02.301 --> 46:05.387
but the authentic Payton
is going to release it.

46:06.096 --> 46:07.681
I have a press release all ready to go

46:07.765 --> 46:08.932
and a call in to Page Six.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.058
This is outlandish--

46:10.142 --> 46:11.435
[Payton] But, but, but, but--

46:11.518 --> 46:13.937
Liar. She saw you kissing,
and you know it's true.

46:14.646 --> 46:17.232
What agreement can we come to
to make this go away?

46:17.316 --> 46:19.276
Oh, see, that's more like it.

46:20.027 --> 46:23.280
Now, Senator, I know that you have visions
for a larger political career.

46:23.363 --> 46:25.324
I know that you wanna be
the vice president.

46:25.824 --> 46:28.410
And that can still very much happen
if you drop out of this race,

46:28.494 --> 46:30.204
-citing medical reasons.
-[laughs] Oh.

46:30.829 --> 46:33.624
Now... [clears throat]
Your husband will have a heart attack.

46:33.707 --> 46:36.835
There's a cardiologist at Columbia.
He's already drawn up all the paperwork.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.629
You and I will hold
a joint press conference.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.839
You will drop out of the race,
citing Marcus's health.

46:40.923 --> 46:42.508
You endorse me to replace you.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.134
The throuple story... dies.

46:44.676 --> 46:46.845
And you're still well on your way
to the VP slot.

46:47.846 --> 46:50.098
-How's that sound?
-You insufferable little prick!

46:51.099 --> 46:53.519
Ooh, reminder, she was in a throuple,
and I have evidence.

46:55.103 --> 46:58.482
You really are an evil little troll.

46:58.565 --> 47:00.526
No, really, I want to win.

47:02.903 --> 47:06.156
Give me what I want,
and you get to win too.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.036
[clicks tongue]

47:11.787 --> 47:12.871
Excuse me.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.255
-Are you sure, darling?
-[Payton] Of course.

47:21.338 --> 47:23.841
Of course. It was wrong of me
to ask you to drop out,

47:23.924 --> 47:26.218
and... it won't be necessary.

47:27.344 --> 47:28.428
We're both gonna win.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.390
-I love you, Mom.
-I love you.

47:36.937 --> 47:37.938
Everything okay?

47:39.064 --> 47:40.190
Couldn't be better.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.617
[sighs]

48:01.378 --> 48:04.673
I imagine that was hard.
But don't pack it up just yet.

48:05.465 --> 48:07.050
Payton was in a threesome too.

48:10.679 --> 48:12.598
[theme music playing]
