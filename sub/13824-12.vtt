03:02.181 --> 03:04.559
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
What happened?

03:04.559 --> 03:08.187
Thomas! This is unforgivable.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.983
Not only did you have a wild party
and destroy our home...

03:11.983 --> 03:15.945
...but you can't even get rid
of one tiny mouse.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.368
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
That's the last straw.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.913
I've absolutely
had it with you, Thomas.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.040
I'm through giving you
chance after chance.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.708
You're being replaced.

03:31.127 --> 03:34.672
You're obsolete, Thomas.
It's no use.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.675
I've already ordered something
that will do your job...

03:37.675 --> 03:41.512
...far better than you ever have.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.018
Well, well, perfect timing.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.188
Thomas...

03:51.397 --> 03:55.151
Thomas, get away from the door.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.195
I warned you.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.781
Mrs. Two-Shoes?
- Yes?

03:59.781 --> 04:02.158
It's your Verminator 7000.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.576
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
Wonderful.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.287
Now we'll see
some real changes around here.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.830
Have a good day.

04:07.830 --> 04:10.416
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
Oh, I will.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.086
Here, kitty-kitty.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.729
It's that horrid little mouse again!
Help!

06:37.313 --> 06:38.731
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
Help!

06:40.608 --> 06:44.028
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.321
What? No.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.660
Whoa!

06:53.579 --> 06:55.289
No, no, no. Come back.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.083
He's getting away.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.508
Stop, you horrible thing.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.926
Don't come any closer.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.728
MRS. TWO-SHOES:
Thomas? Thomas, is that you?

07:17.728 --> 07:22.859
Oh, Thomas.
You've stopped that dreadful monster.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.571
And you caught the mouse. Oh, good.

07:26.571 --> 07:30.616
Good pussycat.
I should never have doubted you.

07:30.616 --> 07:36.372
You've got your old job
and your old home back again.

07:36.372 --> 07:40.168
No more mechanical monstrosities
around here.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.565
Mmm.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.586
Ah.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.259
Mmm. Hmm.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.300
That's a good one, Tom.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.287
<i>Poor Tom.</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:57.748
<i>Biggest star in Hollywood.</i>

15:58.499 --> 16:00.751
<i>The hottest cat around.</i>

16:00.751 --> 16:06.256
<i>Yet no amount of laughter
or praise can satisfy him.</i>

16:50.718 --> 16:55.013
<i>Tom has reached
the pinnacle of success.</i>

16:55.013 --> 16:57.516
<i>But is this all there is?</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:12.656
Thomas, my number one star!

17:12.656 --> 17:15.576
Mr. Ten Percent here.
What can I do for you?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.662
But, Tom, you can't quit show business.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.456
You're a star. The biggest.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.374
Your public would never forgive you.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.669
Oh, forget them,
I would never forgive you.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.340
And your thumb
won't work outside of Hollywood.

17:41.351 --> 17:44.938
<i>What could Tom possibly be thinking?</i>

17:44.938 --> 17:49.443
<i>How could Cat Numero Uno
throw away his career?</i>

17:49.443 --> 17:54.072
<i>Will a simpler life really be so simple?</i>

17:58.786 --> 18:00.037
Ew.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.052
Huh?

19:03.642 --> 19:04.935
Blech.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.647
<i>Poor Tom.</i>

19:08.647 --> 19:13.986
<i>Apparently, your thumb
really doesn't work outside of Hollywood.</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:19.449
Blech!

20:13.003 --> 20:14.421
Hmm?

21:58.108 --> 22:02.612
<i>It sure is lonely at the top. Isn't it, Jerry?</i>
