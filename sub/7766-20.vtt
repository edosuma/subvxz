00:14.999 --> 00:17.999
- Previously this season
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:17.999 --> 00:21.999
- Katie Maloney,
will you marry me?

00:21.999 --> 00:22.999
- Of course.

00:22.999 --> 00:25.000
- Everybody's been welcoming.

00:25.999 --> 00:27.999
- No one's punched me in the
face or called me a bitch yet.

00:27.999 --> 00:28.999
- Well, that's good.

00:28.999 --> 00:32.999
The other girls are just gonna
love this Lala.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
Or not.

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
- Your own family has noticed
a change in your personality.

00:37.999 --> 00:40.999
- I don't give a f***
if Scheana cares a lot more

00:40.999 --> 00:43.999
about being popular
than about being loyal.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.999
- I just don't feel
like she's my friend anymore

00:45.999 --> 00:46.999
like you totally are.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.999
- It's a shame
to let that friendship go.

00:49.999 --> 00:51.999
Sit down and talk to her.

00:51.999 --> 00:54.999
- I love Hooters!
- She's not moving in with you.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
- No, no, no.
She's not moving in.

00:56.999 --> 00:58.000
- She's not moving in, right?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.999
- She's not moving in,
I promise.

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
How am I gonna fit
all this in my apartment?

01:01.999 --> 01:02.999
I have officially hit the point

01:02.999 --> 01:05.999
where living with Brittany
is too much.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
- I really thought I was gonna
miss you, Kristen.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.999
But I've honestly been thinking
more about Lala.

01:10.999 --> 01:12.999
- He thinks
that he's getting laid.

01:12.999 --> 01:15.999
He's not.
Get out of my face!

01:15.999 --> 01:17.999
- You're still
crazy about Kristen.

01:17.999 --> 01:19.999
- I would never, ever, ever
get back together

01:19.999 --> 01:21.999
with that f***ing douchebag.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.999
- I miss you, Kristen.
- We were definitely boning.

01:25.999 --> 01:27.999
- It's very weird
that I get jealous

01:27.999 --> 01:30.999
when James tells me
that he slept with Kristen.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.999
He absolutely has feelings
for her still.

01:32.999 --> 01:35.999
- Me and my bandmate, Isaac,
have this song...

01:35.999 --> 01:37.999
♪ Let's touch in public ♪

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
- Action!

01:39.999 --> 01:40.999
- Let's get people
off their ass

01:40.999 --> 01:43.999
and get 'em dancing.

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
- Stassi's living
with Kristen now?

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
Am I gonna finally see her?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.999
I haven't seen her
in God knows how long.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
- You had a boss
and you had a good friend,

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999
and you f***ed it up.

01:52.999 --> 01:54.999
- I jut want to make things
right with people

01:54.999 --> 01:56.999
that I actually care about.

01:56.999 --> 01:57.999
- This is the first time
I have heard

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
Stassi admit she was wrong.

01:59.999 --> 02:01.999
Could we maybe have

02:01.999 --> 02:02.999
our engagement party
at your house?

02:02.999 --> 02:05.999
- I do not want
Stassi or Kristen there.

02:05.999 --> 02:06.999
- No Kristen, no Stassi.

02:07.999 --> 02:09.999
- I'm letting you know
she doesn't want you there.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.999
- This blows.
- You don't know me!

02:11.999 --> 02:13.999
You don't know my life.
- You don't know me!

02:13.999 --> 02:15.999
- James is this young
little brat.

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
- What is your issue with me?
- You're obnoxious.

02:18.999 --> 02:19.999
- Oh, f***, well,
so are you, brah.

02:19.999 --> 02:21.999
- Your ego is out of control.

02:21.999 --> 02:24.999
That's the person
you become when you're drunk.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
We need to take
a permanent break.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
- Jax just got arrested.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.999
- How much a f***ing idiot do
you have to be

02:30.999 --> 02:32.999
to steal a pair of sunglasses?

02:32.999 --> 02:33.999
- Do you think
they could put you in jail?

02:33.999 --> 02:34.999
- I don't know.

02:35.999 --> 02:36.999
I have to take a red-eye

02:36.999 --> 02:38.999
back to Hawaii to go to court.

02:38.999 --> 02:41.000
I feel like I'm in jail
right now.

03:34.999 --> 03:35.999
I'm in the kitchen.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.999
I'm washing these dishes,

03:37.999 --> 03:40.999
because I knew you'd be mad
if you came home

03:40.999 --> 03:42.999
and they're not ready.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.999
How was it?

03:46.999 --> 03:48.999
How was your flight?

03:48.999 --> 03:50.999
- Well, the court
and everything was fine.

03:50.999 --> 03:53.999
It's the flying,
the sleeping, the no eating;

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
that's what's bothering me.

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
I haven't gone to bed
in 24 hours,

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
and then the two days
before that,

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
I had to be up at 5:00 a.m.,

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
my flight got delayed,

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
and my TV was stuck in German.

04:06.999 --> 04:07.999
- Oh, my God, that's the worst.

04:07.999 --> 04:10.999
- It couldn't have
gotten any worse.

04:10.999 --> 04:12.999
My hope for this trip
was to get in,

04:12.999 --> 04:18.999
get out--go see my lawyer,

04:18.999 --> 04:21.999
get my charges dropped down
from a felony to a misdemeanor,

04:21.999 --> 04:24.999
and then just get out.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.999
And that's exactly
what happened.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.999
- So you're on probation now.

04:31.999 --> 04:32.999
- Basically, all I got to do

04:32.999 --> 04:34.999
is just keep my nose clean,
and it goes away.

04:34.999 --> 04:36.999
It's not even gonna be
on my record, nothing.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.999
It's like it never happened.
I'm exhausted.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
- I know. I just want you
to be happy to see me.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.999
- I'm happy to see you.
I really am.

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
I'm really happy--

04:47.999 --> 04:49.999
- Glad to get away
from me for a day?

04:49.999 --> 04:53.999
- I just want some peace
and quiet.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.999
I haven't slept in 24 hours.

04:55.999 --> 04:58.999
I'm coming home to
f***ing construction next door.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.999
Like, I don't want
to live here.

05:00.999 --> 05:01.999
We're on top of each other.

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
I'm a clean freak,

05:03.999 --> 05:06.999
and I hate what it looks like
in that closet.

05:06.999 --> 05:08.999
- It only looks
like that in the closet

05:08.999 --> 05:11.999
because there's not enough space
to put my clothes.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
- I know that.

05:13.999 --> 05:14.999
That's why I'm saying,

05:14.999 --> 05:18.000
please, please,
help me get an apartment.

05:18.999 --> 05:20.999
- Where are we gonna move?
- That's your job.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.999
- I don't know
where anything is.

05:22.999 --> 05:24.999
- All you have to do
is go online and find one.

05:24.999 --> 05:27.999
- I had a f***ing boob job.
I can't.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
- But I know
that you can sit in bed

05:29.999 --> 05:30.999
and go online and do this.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.999
- And then you're gone
to frickin' Hawaii.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
When am I supposed
to schedule an appointment?

05:34.999 --> 05:37.999
- Stop digging at me.
Like, I--stop.

05:44.999 --> 05:48.999
- ♪ I miss you
one more minute ♪

05:48.999 --> 05:53.999
♪ And I miss you one more day ♪

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
- For a couple weeks now,

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
I've been looking
for an apartment.

06:04.999 --> 06:07.999
And then I found this.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.999
I'm very particular
about where I live.

06:10.999 --> 06:12.999
Put the sofa, like,
against the wall.

06:12.999 --> 06:14.999
Keep that in here for right now.

06:14.999 --> 06:15.999
That--in my bedroom.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
I never let go of my standards.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
The other box can just stay
in the living room.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.999
I need sky blue walls.
I need hardwood floors.

06:23.999 --> 06:24.999
I need crown molding.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
Doesn't it look so good, though?

06:26.999 --> 06:28.999
I need a lot of closet space.

06:28.999 --> 06:31.999
I haven't seen these
in a really long time.

06:31.999 --> 06:35.999
Now that I have a place to live,
I feel like I got my mojo back.

06:35.999 --> 06:39.999
Hi.
- Hi!

06:39.999 --> 06:42.999
- Oh, this is so sweet.

06:42.999 --> 06:45.999
- Yellow flowers mean
friendships and new beginnings.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
- Okay.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.999
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
- Just walk around it, 'cause
I don't want you to get--

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
- I know.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.999
For the first time
in a long time,

06:58.999 --> 07:01.999
I feel like I have
my best friend back,

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
and it feels really good.

07:06.999 --> 07:10.999
So fun.
- I know.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.999
- Having your own place.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.999
- I haven't lived alone since--

07:15.999 --> 07:18.999
- Since before Jax, so,
like, basically forever.

07:18.999 --> 07:21.999
- Yeah, most of
my boyfriends were, like...

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
- Not...
- Not...

07:23.999 --> 07:24.999
- Capable?

07:24.999 --> 07:27.999
- Very capable of,
like, being handy.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
- You put it in the frame.
I'll hang it.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
- Are you a complete moron?

07:31.999 --> 07:32.999
How do you not know how
to put things in a frame?

07:32.999 --> 07:35.999
- I mean, don't you have
to lay it flat first

07:35.999 --> 07:36.999
for a couple days
and put books on it?

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
- I'm just gonna end up
hanging it anyway.

07:38.999 --> 07:40.999
I don't even know
why I asked you to come over...

07:40.999 --> 07:41.999
- I'll hang it.
- 'Cause I end up

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
doing everything always.

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
I did everything,
and I like doing everything.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.999
- I can't take this anymore.

07:50.999 --> 07:53.999
- I can't either.
- I can't escape you.

07:55.999 --> 07:57.999
- Well...
- This is a relationship.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.999
It's 50/50.

07:59.999 --> 08:00.999
I got to get something
out of it too.

08:00.999 --> 08:03.000
- What is that supposed
to--wait, what is that supposed

08:03.999 --> 08:05.999
to mean, that you're supposed
to get something out of it?

08:05.999 --> 08:06.999
Like, you don't think
you're getting anything

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
out of being
in a relationship with me?

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
- Oh, my gosh.
- You think that me

08:10.999 --> 08:13.999
leaving my family,
living in a studio apartment

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
to be with you, working
at Hooters--

08:16.999 --> 08:18.999
you wanted all this.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.999
You asked for all this.
That's what you wanted.

08:21.999 --> 08:24.999
I just hate when you are
in a bad mood and stuff

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
and you take it out on me.

08:25.999 --> 08:28.999
- Oh, my gosh,
you're making this about you.

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
- I'm not.

08:30.999 --> 08:32.999
- Sitting in that jail cell

08:32.999 --> 08:35.999
when I went to jail
was the most at peace

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
I was with myself
for a long time.

08:37.999 --> 08:44.999
It was actually peace and quiet
where I could actually think.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.999
'Cause my mind
is like this all the time.

08:46.999 --> 08:50.999
My mind's finally, like,
slowing down a little bit

08:50.999 --> 08:53.999
and digesting
this whole f***ing summer,

08:53.999 --> 08:57.999
of all this stupid, petty sh**
that's gone on.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
Honest to God, please,
keep the jail door shut.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
I'll stay in here.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
- Did we need a few minutes
with the menu?

09:26.999 --> 09:29.999
- Hi, guys, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

09:32.999 --> 09:33.999
- What's up?
- What's up, dude?

09:33.999 --> 09:36.000
- How are you, man?
- Good.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.999
You want to do a Metropolitan?

09:37.999 --> 09:40.000
- I haven't drank for two weeks
now, bruv.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.999
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.999
- How you doing?

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
- I've been texting Kristen
lately. I mean, like--

09:46.999 --> 09:47.999
- Oh, man.
- What?

09:47.999 --> 09:50.000
- I know, dude.
It's f***ing weird.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.999
We went out to dinner
the other night.

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
Recently, Kristen
and I went out,

09:54.999 --> 09:57.999
sparks was flying, and then
emotional things happened.

09:57.999 --> 09:59.999
You know I love you, right?

09:59.999 --> 10:02.999
But another part of me really
still likes Lala.

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
So really it's just
about what door's gonna

10:04.999 --> 10:06.999
open up the widest,
and I'm just gonna...

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
walk
right through that one.

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
Back to bussing, boss.
- All right, dude.

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
- Back to bussing.

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
- Do you have, like,
a safety pin

10:18.999 --> 10:21.999
or anything in your purse?

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
This thing is literally
hanging on by a thread.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
- Yeah. I know, right?

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
I'm actually really worried
about tomorrow.

10:29.999 --> 10:31.999
- The engagement party?
- Yeah.

10:31.999 --> 10:37.999
I'm definitely going to need
a lot of liquid courage.

10:37.999 --> 10:42.999
I am absolutely shocked that
Katie would extend the invite.

10:42.999 --> 10:46.999
In our friendship, there have
been no ups and downs,

10:46.999 --> 10:47.999
just downs.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
Katie, on the other hand,
you don't like at all?

10:49.999 --> 10:51.999
- She doesn't really
like you either.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.999
- Oh, break my heart.

10:53.999 --> 10:56.999
- You're taking your top off
in front of my fiancé.

10:56.999 --> 10:59.000
- You're just vulgar as f***.
- Me?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.999
I will be having a party

11:00.999 --> 11:04.999
that I obviously don't
want you to attend.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
I have the worst anxiety.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.999
What do I do with my hair?
What do I wear?

11:09.999 --> 11:10.999
What do I--like,
I have no idea.

11:10.999 --> 11:14.999
- Well, the theme is Lace
and Linen, so dress for,

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
like, a mom
and a grandma meeting you

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
for the first time.

11:18.999 --> 11:22.999
But I'm actually more worried
about Ariana being there.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.999
It's really unfortunate,
the place

11:25.999 --> 11:27.999
Ariana and I are in right now.

11:27.999 --> 11:32.999
I just don't even know if
this friendship can be salvaged.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
It's exhausting.
I just need to focus

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
on my own life
and my own relationships.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
- Okay, well,
I'm gonna need you, so, girl,

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
you got to put it together.

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
And then, like, the whole
Kristen-James thing.

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
He tells me that she called me
a "ratchet whore."

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
- Do you think
it was easy for me

11:49.999 --> 11:54.999
to see you with f***ing
ratchet whorebag Lala?

11:54.999 --> 11:55.999
- "Ratchet"...

11:55.999 --> 11:57.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:57.999 --> 11:59.999
Whore is another--
I don't know about that.

11:59.999 --> 12:01.999
The thing about him is,
though,

12:01.999 --> 12:05.999
is it's like I really genuinely
do care about him.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
She has nothing
to do with me and James,

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
so I'm gonna
let Kristen be cracky

12:10.999 --> 12:14.999
and just focus
on what James and I have.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
Thanks, babe.
- You're welcome.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
- And I don't even look ratchet.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.999
- Nope.
- I don't like a ratchet whore.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- Your dress doesn't.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
- What's up, man?
- Hey. What's going on?

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
- So I take it you don't have
to do any time or anything now?

12:33.999 --> 12:36.000
- No time.
- That's good, man.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.999
- All good.
- You got off really lucky.

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
- I know.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.999
- I've known Jax
for a long time,

12:42.999 --> 12:45.999
and he's stolen from me,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
he's slept with my girlfriend,

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
spread horrible rumors
about me,

12:50.999 --> 12:54.999
and if I never
saw that guy again,

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
I'd probably miss that ass****.

12:56.999 --> 13:00.999
Jax is probably gonna be around
for the rest of my life.

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
- I'm like a cat
with nine lives, you know?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.999
I'm like--I think
that was my last life.

13:12.999 --> 13:15.999
- Hello.
- Hi, Lisa. How are you?

13:18.999 --> 13:22.999
- Oh, Mr. Taylor, you're back.

13:22.999 --> 13:26.999
What happened?
Did you beg for forgiveness?

13:26.999 --> 13:28.999
- They don't have time
for people like me.

13:28.999 --> 13:29.999
They got criminal cases.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
Like, I was in a court
where there was people

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
who were doing
some serious sh**.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.999
They were like, "We get it.
Yadda, yadda, you're sorry.

13:36.999 --> 13:37.999
Fine. Move on."

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
- Yeah, but don't minimize it.
- I--no.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.999
- By saying that--no,
but you--no, no, no.

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
You're minimizing everything.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
- I wanted to say I'm sorry,
but he didn't have time

13:45.999 --> 13:46.999
to listen to my spiel.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
- You still need to compute
that your--

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
- I am.
I'm telling you what--listen.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
Do you want to argue with me,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
or do you want to listen
to what I'm saying?

13:56.999 --> 13:58.999
I'm not your 21-year-old son.

13:58.999 --> 14:00.999
Don't verbally abuse me.

14:00.999 --> 14:02.999
- You seem a little
aggressive right now. Maybe I--

14:02.999 --> 14:04.000
- I'm not aggressive.
- Yeah, you are.

14:04.999 --> 14:05.999
- I'm just tired.
I haven't slept yet.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
- I don't give a damn
whether you're tired.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.999
I don't give a damn
whether you fly halfway

14:10.999 --> 14:11.999
round the world
to go to court.

14:11.999 --> 14:14.999
- But you want to know
why I'm aggressive; that's why.

14:14.999 --> 14:18.999
- Although Jax is getting older,
he's not actually growing up.

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
To be accountable--
that's the only way

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
you can learn
from the situation.

14:23.999 --> 14:25.999
Get out of my face.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.999
- Don't say "get
out of my face."

14:27.999 --> 14:29.000
- Get out of my face now.
- That's--

14:29.999 --> 14:33.999
- Go. Go. Go.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
Steven, can I have
a glass of rosé, please?

14:35.999 --> 14:37.999
- Absolutely.

14:41.999 --> 14:44.999
- Coming up...
- Uh-oh. I see trouble.

14:44.999 --> 14:47.999
- What if she throws us off
her mountain?

14:47.999 --> 14:49.999
- Stop talking.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.999
♪ Call if you want to ♪

14:58.999 --> 15:01.999
♪ Say that you love me ♪

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
♪ Call if you want to ♪

15:08.999 --> 15:10.999
- What's up, guys?
- Hi.

15:10.999 --> 15:14.999
- Lots and lots of stuff.
- Got booze, man.

15:14.999 --> 15:17.999
- Holy sh**, there are
so many details--

15:17.999 --> 15:21.999
chairs and flowers,
tablecloths.

15:21.999 --> 15:22.999
- It's so hot.

15:22.999 --> 15:27.999
- It is--mm--maybe 500 degrees
outside.

15:27.999 --> 15:29.999
I think I might die.

15:29.999 --> 15:30.999
- Hey, you guys.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:32.999 --> 15:33.999
- It's so hot.

15:33.999 --> 15:36.999
- Where are your umbrellas
and things?

15:36.999 --> 15:39.999
- I didn't think of umbrellas.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
- Well, you need umbrellas
down here.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
Do you want to borrow
some of my umbrellas up there?

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
- If it's not too much trouble.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.000
- Well, it's all
too much trouble.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.999
- Well, I mean, you know, I'm--
- Where's your help?

15:49.999 --> 15:50.999
- This is--
- This is our help.

15:50.999 --> 15:54.999
This is the help.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.999
- Let's see. How do you--
- You pull the thing out.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
- The latch.
You pinch--I'm scared.

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
- Don't be a pussy.
Just do it.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
- We made the centerpieces
from scratch.

16:13.999 --> 16:16.999
- That looks very sweet.
- I'm very proud of it.

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
- I got it now.
It's so heavy.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.999
f***ing scorching.

16:34.999 --> 16:36.999
- Are you getting ready
out there?

16:36.999 --> 16:40.999
- No, I got to charge
these microphones for tonight.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.999
Following Tom and Katie's
engagement party,

16:43.999 --> 16:45.999
there will be an afterparty
at Sur,

16:46.999 --> 16:49.999
where I'm going to be
performing "Touch in Public"

16:49.999 --> 16:51.000
for the first time.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
I'm really nervous.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
- I guess eventually I have
to talk to Scheana,

16:57.999 --> 17:00.999
which is gonna be so much fun.

17:00.999 --> 17:03.999
I can't wait.

17:03.999 --> 17:07.999
I'm just really tired
of this pageant queen persona,

17:07.999 --> 17:10.999
this "I'm sassy"
and "f*** you"

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
and--I don't know that person,

17:13.999 --> 17:16.999
and that's not the person
I became friends with.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.999
- This has gone on
for long enough,

17:18.999 --> 17:21.999
and today's the day
that this just

17:21.999 --> 17:23.999
needs to f***ing end.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
- One way or another.
- Exactly.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.999
- Maybe it would be
the best option

17:30.999 --> 17:33.999
if you and I came
kind of fashionably late.

17:33.999 --> 17:38.999
- I'm just, like,
antsy about Lisa.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
- Is there a possibility
Lisa's gonna be like,

17:40.999 --> 17:42.999
"You're not allowed here;

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
you're not welcome
in my home"?

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
I'm aware that
that's a possibility, but--

17:45.999 --> 17:48.999
- But that's
why I'm scared right now.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.999
- I'm usually not welcome
in al to of places.

17:50.999 --> 17:52.999
- That would just be very weird.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.000
- Welcome to my team.

17:54.999 --> 17:57.999
- The only thing that I have
holding me back right now

17:57.999 --> 18:02.999
is that I have self-respect
and dignity.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
Thank God for Kristen,

18:04.999 --> 18:08.999
who is unburdened
by those anchors.

18:09.999 --> 18:12.999
- I don't even know
who's all going.

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
I mean, obviously,
like, Scheana, Brittany,

18:14.999 --> 18:18.999
like, Jax, everyone, which
you're fine with, right?

18:18.999 --> 18:21.000
You can talk to Jax, you know?

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- I don't know.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
I don't know
what I would say--just--

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- Do you think
you're gonna actually, like,

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
have a conversation with him?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.999
Are you gonna, like, converse?

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
- It's just very strange.

18:33.999 --> 18:35.000
Do you know what I'm saying?
Like--

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
- Yeah.
- It's just--yeah.

18:37.999 --> 18:41.999
- When's the last time
you even talked to Stassi?

18:41.999 --> 18:45.999
- Uh...hoo.

18:47.999 --> 18:50.999
- I mean, you guys dated
so long ago, so--

18:50.999 --> 18:52.999
- I don't even
know the girl anymore.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.999
I've had three girlfriends
since then.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.999
Talking to Stassi
shouldn't be weird.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.999
We're both in total
different places now,

19:00.999 --> 19:02.999
but there's a little bit
of nervousness,

19:02.999 --> 19:04.999
maybe a little anxiety.

19:04.999 --> 19:06.999
Whenever it happened,
it happened. We've moved on.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
We've all--we have
different relationships,

19:08.999 --> 19:11.999
and I hope you're happy,
and that's it.

19:11.999 --> 19:13.999
- Um, has James
been texting you?

19:13.999 --> 19:16.999
- Yeah. James says he wants
to be back together with me.

19:16.999 --> 19:18.999
He said he missed me
and he loves me.

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
Well, ****, I'd miss
and love me too.

19:21.999 --> 19:23.999
I just want the best for him.

19:23.999 --> 19:25.999
I want him to turn
his life around.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
I want him getting fired
from Pump

19:27.999 --> 19:30.999
to turn into a positive thing.

19:30.999 --> 19:33.999
I know that I'm not
responsible for,

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
like, James's,
like, change,

19:35.999 --> 19:41.999
but if I can aid in making him
feel a little bit good--

19:41.999 --> 19:45.999
- You have no loyalty
to James right now?

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
- This is his last chance.

19:47.999 --> 19:49.999
Like, if he f***s me over again,

19:49.999 --> 19:53.999
James, like, then f*** it.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
- Hey, you guys look
amazing.

20:07.999 --> 20:08.999
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.999
Good to see you.
Congrats, guys.

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
- What's going on?

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
- An engagement party
is a family affair,

20:14.999 --> 20:16.999
so we've got Tom's mom.

20:16.999 --> 20:19.999
- This is beautiful, yes.

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
- I also have my mom
and my grandmother.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
- Let's get a drink.

20:24.999 --> 20:28.999
- I'm really excited to have
my brothers coming to town.

20:28.999 --> 20:30.000
I don't get to see them enough.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.999
My parents separated
a few years ago.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.999
My dad could not take time off

20:35.999 --> 20:37.999
to come
to our engagement party.

20:37.999 --> 20:40.999
He works as
a lift engineer in Utah.

20:40.999 --> 20:43.999
This just means he will
definitely be at the wedding.

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- This is my gorgeous
mom.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
- Hello.
Hi, nice to meet you.

20:47.999 --> 20:50.999
- Very lovely, Lisa.
- Very sweet.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.999
- Having my mom here
means so much.

20:53.999 --> 20:56.999
I wish my younger triplet
brothers could have been here,

20:56.999 --> 21:01.999
but they live all the way
over in Jacksonville, Florida.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.999
My dad was a detective

21:03.999 --> 21:06.999
in the Minneapolis Police
Department for 30 years.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.999
My dad couldn't make it,
and I totally understand.

21:09.999 --> 21:11.999
He has a fear of flying.

21:11.999 --> 21:14.999
I wish he could be here with us,
because I love him a lot.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.999
- Bring it in. Bring it in.
- You handsome boy, you.

21:17.999 --> 21:21.999
- How you doing?
- Good. Nice to see you.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
- Nice to see you too.

21:25.999 --> 21:28.999
- Before I left
the house this morning,

21:28.999 --> 21:32.999
I had approximately 14 mimosas,

21:32.999 --> 21:35.999
maybe a few shots
of vodka after that.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
- Hi there.
- Hi.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
- Why do we have the same hair?

21:40.999 --> 21:41.999
- You guys, I just said that.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.999
I'm like, "I have not worn
my hair like this."

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
- I'm glad
we have the same thing.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.999
- Hi.
- Hi, love.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.999
- So funny.

21:53.999 --> 21:55.999
That's so funny.

21:55.999 --> 21:59.999
- Who would like some rosé?

22:00.999 --> 22:03.999
I think we should be
celebrating.

22:03.999 --> 22:05.999
- We are having
such a wonderful time.

22:05.999 --> 22:06.999
Thank you so much.

22:06.999 --> 22:09.999
- Darling.
- Thank you so much.

22:09.999 --> 22:14.999
- So what about your wonderful
grandson-in-law, right?

22:14.999 --> 22:19.999
- You know they say, "Watch
how a man treats his mother"?

22:19.999 --> 22:21.999
- I always agree
with that.

22:21.999 --> 22:25.999
- You see how he treats her,
and it's wonderful.

22:25.999 --> 22:29.999
- Ken's like that. He used to
be like that with his mother.

22:29.999 --> 22:33.999
That's a very good indication
of how he feels about women.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
- Y'all, I'll just--I'll just
sneak in here.

22:35.999 --> 22:38.999
- Oh, look at Giggy.
- Oh, Giggy.

22:45.999 --> 22:48.999
- That's really, really good.
It's amazing.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
- Oh!

22:50.999 --> 22:53.999
James has a hard time
getting it in the hole.

22:53.999 --> 22:54.999
- f*** it. I'm over it.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.999
You're telling me, girl.

23:05.999 --> 23:07.999
- A year ago, Ariana
and I would have been joined

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
at the hip
at a party like this,

23:09.999 --> 23:12.999
and now I feel
like there's a VIP table

23:12.999 --> 23:14.999
at this party for two.

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
Whatever.
I'm over it.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
I'm going to pretend
they're not really here.

23:19.999 --> 23:23.999
- I'll never get over
how nice this place is.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
- Sure, dude.

23:37.999 --> 23:40.999
- What if she throws us
off her mountain?

23:40.999 --> 23:43.999
- Stop talking.
I need you to stop talking.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.999
I so admire Kristen's bravery

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
when it comes
to crashing events.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
I'm scared.

23:50.999 --> 23:53.999
Somewhere along the line,
she had a shame-ectomy.

23:53.999 --> 23:57.999
That part of her has just been,
like, amputated.

24:00.999 --> 24:03.999
- Uh-oh. I see trouble.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
- Oh, God.

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
- Coming up...

24:16.999 --> 24:19.999
- Kristen,
I'm the one person, babe,

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
you don't want
to f***ing go there with.

24:21.999 --> 24:23.999
- I'm really scared.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
- We're good, right?
- Oh, yeah.

24:36.999 --> 24:40.999
- Uh-oh.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.999
- Oh, God.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
- I'm not sure if I saw
two angels or two devils

24:47.999 --> 24:49.999
just now, mate.

24:49.999 --> 24:57.999
- Oh, my God.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
- You look so pretty.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.999
- I'm really happy
that you came.

25:01.999 --> 25:04.999
- I'm so happy I'm here.

25:04.999 --> 25:08.000
- This party is
a very big moment for me,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.999
and I want the people closest
to me to be here,

25:11.999 --> 25:13.999
regardless of
what we've been through.

25:13.999 --> 25:16.999
- I'm so glad that we're here.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.999
- My God.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
- Hi.
- You guys match.

25:21.999 --> 25:24.999
I can't believe
they're actually here.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
That just took major balls.

25:26.999 --> 25:28.999
- You guys aren't
supposed to be here.

25:28.999 --> 25:29.999
I mean, I don't mind
that you guys are here,

25:29.999 --> 25:31.999
but Lisa's gonna get pissed.

25:31.999 --> 25:34.999
This puts me in an
uncomfortable spot with Lisa,

25:34.999 --> 25:38.999
and, you know,
I'm #TeamLisa, ride or die.

25:38.999 --> 25:40.999
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.

25:40.999 --> 25:43.999
- Oh, God, no.

25:43.999 --> 25:46.999
It has been a really beautiful,
beautiful afternoon.

25:46.999 --> 25:48.999
- I know.
- So don't f*** it up.

25:48.999 --> 25:51.999
- This is the one thing
we're not f***ing up.

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
- Well, what--well...

25:53.999 --> 25:56.999
What do I actually need
to keep these two out?

25:56.999 --> 25:59.999
Clearly, just two gates
isn't enough.

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
Well, do whatever you want.

26:13.999 --> 26:15.999
- Brittany. Brit.

26:15.999 --> 26:18.999
- Love it.
- Come here.

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
I want you to meet someone.
- Hi.

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
- Hi.
- This is Stassi.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
- Nothing but really nice things
about you,

26:23.999 --> 26:26.999
and I've always said
that I think Jax

26:26.999 --> 26:28.999
has the best taste
in girlfriends.

26:28.999 --> 26:30.999
- Girls? Yeah.
- Yes.

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
- I love Rachel.
I like Carmen. I like myself.

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
- I know I'm a little drunk,
but I just realized

26:37.000 --> 26:39.999
that my current girlfriend
is talking to my ex-girlfriend.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.999
- Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you as well.

26:41.999 --> 26:44.999
- Yay!

26:44.999 --> 26:48.999
- I see, like, zero similarities
between me and Brittany.

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
She seems so nice.

26:50.999 --> 26:53.999
I don't want Jax to taint her.

26:53.999 --> 26:54.999
- I'm trying to think of, like,

26:54.999 --> 26:56.999
"What advice
could I possible give?"

26:56.999 --> 26:57.999
- Yeah.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
- Go get all of
his password for everything.

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
- Oh, I already have 'em.

27:11.999 --> 27:12.999
- Hey!

27:15.999 --> 27:16.999
- Hello.

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
- How are you, gorgeous?
- How are you?

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
- I'm doing
really great, actually.

27:19.999 --> 27:22.999
I have something to show you.
- What?

27:22.999 --> 27:26.000
- I honestly care
about this so much, Lisa.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
This has honestly been
my life dream.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
Not only did Lisa fire me,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.999
but she also said
the "Pump" album is off.

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
But I carried on working on it,

27:35.999 --> 27:38.999
and now I've got
a finished product.

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
Kristen's here.
We're doing a little better.

27:40.999 --> 27:42.999
Honestly, like,
everything has just,

27:42.999 --> 27:44.999
like, been a lot better
for me right now.

27:44.999 --> 27:49.999
- I'm proud of you for actually
having a different attitude.

27:49.999 --> 27:52.999
James has got everything
at his fingertips,

27:52.999 --> 27:56.999
but alcohol could make
all this go away.

27:56.999 --> 27:58.999
If you're gonna drink,
you're gonna fail.

27:58.999 --> 28:00.999
I'm proud of you
for doing better.

28:00.999 --> 28:02.999
- Thank you so much.
I'm so happy.

28:04.999 --> 28:06.999
- Is it barbecue time?

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
- Hi. How are you?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.999
Can I have a hug?
- Yes.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.999
Are we British?
Are we British?

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
- Give me a hug.
- Are we British now?

28:21.999 --> 28:24.000
Why do we double kiss?

28:24.000 --> 28:27.999
- You look gorgeous, love.
Can I say that first?

28:27.999 --> 28:29.999
You look very pretty.
- You like my dress?

28:29.999 --> 28:31.999
You look like an angel.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
- You too.
- Thanks.

28:36.999 --> 28:39.999
- Everything about Kristen
pisses me off.

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
I hate her hair.
Her outfits are sh**ty.

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
I hate her shoes.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
I just don't think
she's a good person.

28:45.999 --> 28:49.999
- Look.
- Give it to me.

28:51.999 --> 28:55.999
Okay.
- Say it in my accent.

28:55.999 --> 28:58.000
- I can't do
a British accent anymore.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.999
- "Pump Sessions is a..."

28:59.999 --> 29:01.999
"Compilation of music

29:01.999 --> 29:04.999
written and produced
by James Kennedy."

29:04.999 --> 29:06.999
- The James
that I fell in love with

29:06.999 --> 29:09.999
and that I slept with
the other night,

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
that's the good side of James.

29:11.999 --> 29:16.999
If he can learn how to overcome
being his own worst enemy,

29:16.999 --> 29:19.999
he'll go places.

29:19.999 --> 29:21.999
Legit motherf***ing proud
of you, dude.

29:21.999 --> 29:24.999
- Thanks.

29:27.999 --> 29:31.999
- Um, ginger--whatever one's
the least flat.

29:31.999 --> 29:34.999
Like, that looks
like it's now...

29:34.999 --> 29:37.999
Jax is behind me.
I know he's behind me.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
I can feel that he's behind me.

29:39.999 --> 29:42.000
Not here.
Not right now.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.999
- Okay!

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
Hello.

29:48.999 --> 29:51.999
I just want to say
a couple of words.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.999
I have known you, Katie,
for many years,

29:54.999 --> 29:58.999
and Schwartzy, and I couldn't
be happier for you.

29:58.999 --> 30:04.999
As I look around, I'm surprised
to see some of you here,

30:04.999 --> 30:08.999
but I know so many
of you here are so important

30:08.999 --> 30:10.999
in Katie and Tom's life,

30:10.999 --> 30:12.999
so I bless you both.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
- Thank you, Lisa.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
- And if there's anybody here

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
who wants to say anything...

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
Please don't, Kristen.

30:29.999 --> 30:30.999
Okay, let me say that again.

30:30.999 --> 30:33.999
If there's anybody not Kristen

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
that wants to say anything...

30:35.999 --> 30:37.999
- Now's our chance.

30:38.999 --> 30:41.999
- Hi, guys.

30:41.999 --> 30:46.999
I'm gonna give myself
a little bit of credit,

30:46.999 --> 30:52.999
because when little T-Schwa got
out of his Honda Civic

30:52.999 --> 30:57.999
coming from Florida
off of Craigslist

30:57.999 --> 31:01.999
to Sandoval's house,
it was the humor.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
It was the love of music.

31:04.999 --> 31:06.999
It was his quirkiness...

31:06.999 --> 31:09.999
- Kristen is not only
making a speech

31:09.999 --> 31:11.999
but making
the longest speech ever.

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
- Quirkiness, humor.

31:13.999 --> 31:15.999
It was his good looks...

31:15.999 --> 31:20.999
- It just shows how much
she lacks self-awareness, still.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.999
- But that's literally
what it was.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.999
Like, I'm sorry; I played Cupid.

31:25.999 --> 31:27.999
- Can we wrap it up?

31:27.999 --> 31:29.999
What the f***
are you talking about?

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
Can we wrap it up?

31:31.999 --> 31:34.999
I just said what everyone else
was thinking.

31:34.999 --> 31:38.999
- Don't say, "Wrap it up."
- Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
Wrap it up.
- That's ghetto as sh**.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.999
- Can you guys
please--can I--I'm sorry.

31:42.999 --> 31:45.999
I don't care if any of you have
a problem with them.

31:45.999 --> 31:47.999
I want to hear
what they have to say.

31:47.999 --> 31:50.999
Don't be rude right now.

31:50.999 --> 31:54.000
If you're being rude,
you know the way you came in;

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
you can go out. Bye.

31:55.999 --> 32:00.000
- Lala, you know that you were
the very last invitation.

32:00.999 --> 32:01.999
What the f*** do you think
you're doing?

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
- We just keep going.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
- All right,
getting off the soapbox.

32:06.999 --> 32:09.999
- And we were there
from the beginning.

32:09.999 --> 32:13.999
Lala needs to take
her drunk, skank-ass,

32:13.999 --> 32:16.000
shih-tzu-looking hair home.

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
- Anyways, you guys, thank you.

32:18.999 --> 32:19.999
Let's go to Sur,
and let's f*** some sh** up.

32:22.999 --> 32:25.999
- Let's not.
Let's go somewhere else.

32:25.999 --> 32:26.999
Yeah!

32:30.999 --> 32:33.999
- ♪ I'm popping bottles
all night ♪

32:33.999 --> 32:36.999
♪ Got a champagne appetite ♪

32:36.999 --> 32:38.999
♪ Whoa, oh, whoa, oh ♪

32:38.999 --> 32:40.999
♪ And tonight I wanna... ♪

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
- Finally, high time.

32:47.999 --> 32:51.999
- ♪ Now I've finally found
the moment ♪

32:51.999 --> 32:52.999
- Cheers.

32:52.999 --> 32:53.999
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

32:53.999 --> 32:56.999
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo!

32:56.999 --> 32:57.999
- At least be
a peaceful night.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
- It's time to party.

33:03.999 --> 33:04.999
- Hey, don't tempt me tonight,
boy.

33:04.999 --> 33:06.999
- I think you've already
been tempted.

33:06.999 --> 33:08.999
I think you're already

33:08.999 --> 33:09.999
about three sheets
to the wind right now.

33:09.999 --> 33:10.999
- No, I smoked, like,
three joints.

33:11.999 --> 33:12.999
- No.
Well, same thing.

33:12.999 --> 33:14.999
- Is it?
- Well, yeah.

33:14.999 --> 33:16.999
- No, alcohol's
like the opposite.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
- Sure.

33:33.999 --> 33:39.999
- I feel like we're not
on the same page anymore.

33:39.999 --> 33:43.999
And I'm just trying
to figure out

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
if you even want
to be friends anymore.

33:47.999 --> 33:49.999
- It depends.
- On what?

33:49.999 --> 33:52.999
- Scheana, you've been
going behind my back and,

33:52.999 --> 33:55.999
like, talking sh** about me
and talking sh** about Tom.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
- I don't feel I did.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
She's Debbie Downer
the whole time,

33:59.999 --> 34:02.999
and she's gonna ruin
everyone else's mood.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
She's doing her sarcastic thing.

34:04.999 --> 34:05.999
Okay, Bitchy Barbie.

34:08.999 --> 34:12.999
- You just dismiss my opinion
like it's completely invalid.

34:12.999 --> 34:14.999
Do you know
what that feels like?

34:14.999 --> 34:17.999
f***ing feels like sh**.

34:17.999 --> 34:19.999
You have a need
and a desire to be popular

34:19.999 --> 34:21.999
and to be friends
with everybody.

34:29.999 --> 34:31.999
- Vodka soda?
- Yeah.

34:31.999 --> 34:32.999
- Three vodka sodas.

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
- And Stassi too.
- Can you order a fourth one?

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
- Four vodka sodas.

34:39.999 --> 34:41.999
Kristen and Katie and Stassi--
first of all,

34:41.999 --> 34:43.999
I feel uncomfortable
the whole time

34:43.999 --> 34:47.999
I'm with them,
and I just can't do it anymore.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
I can't help
but go back to, like,

34:50.999 --> 34:52.999
how I was this happy last year,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.999
and now I'm not.

34:54.999 --> 35:00.999
I just feel so f***ing sad.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
- I've been worried about you.

35:02.999 --> 35:04.999
I've been worried about Shay.

35:04.999 --> 35:08.999
- I love so many things
about her.

35:08.999 --> 35:10.999
She's very straightforward.

35:10.999 --> 35:13.999
She tells it like it is,
and I miss that,

35:13.999 --> 35:16.999
and I hate crying,
and I do it way too much,

35:16.999 --> 35:19.999
and that's why I get
so much Botox.

35:19.999 --> 35:22.999
I really apologize.

35:24.999 --> 35:26.999
- This is the real Scheana,

35:26.999 --> 35:30.999
not all that other sh**
that she was doing before.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.999
It feels like we can
salvage this friendship.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
Sorry.
- It's okay.

35:35.999 --> 35:37.999
- Or maybe I'm not sorry
I pulled your dress off.

36:01.999 --> 36:03.999
- He knows
exactly what he's doing

36:03.999 --> 36:06.999
by giving Lala
all this attention

36:06.999 --> 36:09.999
while I'm standing right
f***ing there.

36:09.999 --> 36:10.999
- Oh!
- Apologize.

36:10.999 --> 36:12.999
- Ahh. Ahh.

36:12.999 --> 36:14.999
f***.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.999
I'm sorry, it's like
a walking STD, dude.

36:19.999 --> 36:22.999
I can't.
- Kristen. Kristen.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
Can you shut up finally?

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
- "Can you shut up finally?"

36:26.999 --> 36:30.999
Like, can you just leave Sur?
'Cause no one likes you.

36:30.999 --> 36:33.999
- I'm the one person, babe,

36:33.999 --> 36:35.999
you don't want
to f***ing go there with.

36:35.999 --> 36:36.999
- I'm really scared.

36:36.999 --> 36:39.999
- Don't f***ing cross me,
bitch.

36:39.999 --> 36:46.999
Sit the f*** down.
Sit the f*** down.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.000
- Coming up...
- You want to go?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.000
- Don't cross me
in front of Lisa.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.999
- I'll f***ing drop you.
- Be a good boy, old man.

37:02.999 --> 37:04.999
you don't want
to f***ing go there with.

37:04.999 --> 37:07.999
- I'm really scared.
- Sit the f*** down.

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
Sit the f*** down.

37:10.999 --> 37:13.000
- All right, all right, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
No, we're not doing that.
We're not doing that.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.999
Enough is enough.
That was f***ed up.

37:18.999 --> 37:19.999
That was really lowlife.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
- It's ratchet.

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
- Lala was so afraid
she wouldn't be, like,

37:24.999 --> 37:26.999
accepted into this group,

37:26.999 --> 37:29.999
but it turns out
her fears were justified.

37:29.999 --> 37:31.999
What the f*** are you thinking?

37:31.999 --> 37:35.999
- You're better than that.
- I am better than that.

37:35.999 --> 37:37.999
Lala's lucky
that she's caught me

37:37.999 --> 37:41.999
in this very Zen,
grown-up place in my life.

37:41.999 --> 37:43.999
- Lala, I'm gonna be
straight up with you.

37:43.999 --> 37:45.999
This is a moment
where you need to just,

37:45.999 --> 37:48.999
like, own it and be like,
"I f***ed up."

37:48.999 --> 37:50.999
- I'm so sick of walking
up to f***ing people

37:50.999 --> 37:52.999
and being like, "I apologize."

37:52.999 --> 37:54.999
This is who I am.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.999
If you want to be my friend,
you can be my friend.

37:56.999 --> 37:58.999
If you don't want
to be my friend,

37:58.999 --> 38:00.000
then you can f***ing blow me.

38:10.999 --> 38:13.999
- Hey, you guys, do you want
to hear a really cool song?

38:13.999 --> 38:14.999
- Yes.
- Yeah.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.999
- Please.
- We have to go over there.

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
- Yes!

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999
- I'm really nervous
about this performance.

38:24.999 --> 38:27.999
It's in front
of all my friends.

38:27.999 --> 38:29.999
That's the toughest crowd
out there.

38:31.999 --> 38:34.999
- Wait, am I doing
"Good as Gold," or--

38:34.999 --> 38:36.999
- No, we need a bar top.

38:36.999 --> 38:38.999
- ♪ Good as gold ♪

38:40.999 --> 38:43.999
♪ He's as good as gold ♪

38:59.999 --> 39:00.999
- I can't believe this sh**.

39:00.999 --> 39:04.999
James said he wanted
to get back together with me,

39:04.999 --> 39:07.999
and I believed him,
but now I know.

39:07.999 --> 39:09.999
- You're so beautiful, baby.

39:09.999 --> 39:15.999
- James and Lala are a match
made in f***ing heaven.

39:15.999 --> 39:19.999
- Oh, my God,
it's my worst nightmare

39:19.999 --> 39:22.999
to be sitting next to you two.

39:28.999 --> 39:33.000

All that time
and all that money,

40:12.999 --> 40:14.999
it wasn't that wasted.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.999
I mean, he's probably not
gonna see it back.

40:21.999 --> 40:24.999

40:28.999 --> 40:32.999

40:44.999 --> 40:49.999
- I'm gonna--
- Papa Bear. That's Papa Bear.

40:52.999 --> 40:56.999
- No. Why does everyone
think I'm drunk?

40:56.999 --> 40:59.999
I ate four brownies earlier,

40:59.999 --> 41:02.999
and I smoked two joints
before I got here.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
If you want the truth,
I am very stoned,

41:04.999 --> 41:06.999
and I feel like I'm
in space right now,

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
and I honestly feel
like I'm not even here.

41:08.999 --> 41:10.999
I'm on a space lab.

41:10.999 --> 41:13.999
- James is one
of the only people I know

41:13.999 --> 41:17.999
that actually wants
to celebrate his sobriety

41:17.999 --> 41:18.999
by getting wasted.

41:18.999 --> 41:20.999
- He's lying and saying
that he's sober.

41:20.999 --> 41:22.999
- No, I'm not sober.

41:22.999 --> 41:24.999
I--all right, you know what?

41:24.999 --> 41:26.999
- Listen to you. You're wasted.

41:26.999 --> 41:29.999
- Kristina, you got
to shut your f***ing mouth.

41:29.999 --> 41:32.999
- Dumbass.
- Do not talk to me that way.

41:32.999 --> 41:35.999
- Shut your f***ing mouth.
- You're unreal, dude.

41:35.999 --> 41:36.999
No.
- Okay, bye.

41:36.999 --> 41:39.999
- This disrespectful
motherf***er.

41:39.999 --> 41:42.999
You cannot talk
to women like that.

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
He's just this 23-year-old kid.

41:44.999 --> 41:46.999
He feels like he can
talk to women

41:46.999 --> 41:49.999
however he wants,
and that's just not acceptable.

41:49.999 --> 41:51.999
You don't speak like
that in front of women.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.999
- What did you say, again?
- You're clearly not sober.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.999
- I'm stoned.

41:55.999 --> 41:56.999
Whatever.
Who cares?

41:56.999 --> 41:58.999
What are you doing
right now?

42:01.999 --> 42:02.999
You want to go stand
by the bar like that?

42:02.999 --> 42:05.999
I'm still standing here
like a man.

42:05.999 --> 42:07.999
- I'm sitting right here.
- Come on, then.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.000
- No, I'm right here, man.
- Stop. Dude, chill.

42:09.999 --> 42:10.999
Come on.
- What?

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
I'm actually having
the best time ever,

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
because I can say
whatever the f*** I want

42:14.999 --> 42:16.999
to Jax right now,

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
and the big dummy
can't do anything,

42:17.999 --> 42:19.999
'cause he's on probation.

42:19.999 --> 42:21.999
- Just calm it down
a little bit.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
- Stop telling me to calm down.
- All right.

42:24.999 --> 42:27.999
- Okay? When you're the one
that got a felony this summer.

42:27.999 --> 42:30.999
Not me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:30.999 --> 42:31.999
- What do you mean?

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
I was just talking the truth.

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
- Dude, he's not talking sh**.
- No, he is.

42:35.999 --> 42:36.999
- No, he's not.
- Oh, yes, he is.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
- He's not.
- Oh, yes, he is.

42:38.999 --> 42:39.999
- Hey.
- No, he's not, dude.

42:39.999 --> 42:42.999
- Yo. No.
- You got to stop. Seriously.

42:42.999 --> 42:44.999
- I told you--James, I said
this wasn't gonna happen.

42:44.999 --> 42:46.999
- "You need to calm down"
is all I said.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.000
- James, no, no, stop.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.999
- Calm down.
- f*** off, bro.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.999
- This doesn't need to happen.
- So inappropriate.

42:52.999 --> 42:55.000
This is her wedding party.

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
You can't talk
to women like that.

42:56.999 --> 42:58.999
- Stop saying
I'm disrespectful to women

42:59.000 --> 43:01.999
when you've f***ed
over 100 girls.

43:01.999 --> 43:05.999
- James, come on, dude.
- Bye.

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
- Shut up, or I'm gonna drop
my f***ing fist

43:07.999 --> 43:09.999
in your f***ing face.

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- You think I'm f***ing
scared of Jax?

43:11.999 --> 43:13.999
You f***ing think
I couldn't take Jax?

43:13.999 --> 43:15.999
- I'm this close.
I'm gonna hit him.

43:15.999 --> 43:18.999
- Go on, then. Hit me.
- Hey, hey, hey, take a seat.

43:18.999 --> 43:20.999
- You crossed the line.
- Did I?

43:20.999 --> 43:22.999
You crossed the line with me
if you have anything.

43:22.999 --> 43:24.999
- You're about 150 pounds
soaking wet.

43:24.999 --> 43:26.999
Please let me put my fist
in your face.

43:26.999 --> 43:28.999
- Don't cross me
in front of Lisa.

43:28.999 --> 43:30.999
- "Don't cross me"?
You want to go?

43:30.999 --> 43:32.999
- Be a good boy, old man.

43:32.999 --> 43:34.999
- I'm about 200 pounds
heavier than you.

43:34.999 --> 43:37.999
I'll f***ing drop you.

43:39.999 --> 43:41.999
- Coming up...
- Hello.

43:41.999 --> 43:43.999
- You know,
I'll always care about you.

43:43.999 --> 43:46.999
Always.
- I did not expect that.

43:55.999 --> 43:57.999
You crossed the line with me
if you have anything.

43:57.999 --> 43:59.999
- You're about 150 pounds
soaking wet.

43:59.999 --> 44:01.999
Please let me put my fist
in your face.

44:01.999 --> 44:03.999
- Don't cross me
in front of Lisa.

44:03.999 --> 44:04.999
- You want to go?
- You know what?

44:04.999 --> 44:06.999
At the end of the day--
No, no, no.

44:06.999 --> 44:08.999
- I'm about 200 pounds
heavier than you.

44:08.999 --> 44:10.999
I'll f***ing drop you.

44:10.999 --> 44:12.000
- All right, someone's had
a bit too many.

44:12.999 --> 44:14.999
- Let him cool off.
- I will drop your face like a--

44:14.999 --> 44:17.999
- For what reason? Stop.
- Sailor outfit.

44:17.999 --> 44:22.999
- Stop, baby. Stop.
- Take a seat.

44:22.999 --> 44:24.999
- You're on probation,
please.

44:24.999 --> 44:26.999
You cannot get in trouble.
You can't do any of that.

44:26.999 --> 44:29.999
- I want to so bad.
I'm not the type of guy

44:29.999 --> 44:32.999
that sits around
and has a verbal debate.

44:32.999 --> 44:34.999
I solve things using my fists,

44:34.999 --> 44:36.999
and it's definitely not
a good thing

44:36.999 --> 44:38.999
for a guy on probation.

44:38.999 --> 44:40.999
- I'm leaving.

44:40.999 --> 44:43.999
I'm gonna take myself
out of the situation.

44:43.999 --> 44:45.999
Later.

44:50.999 --> 44:52.999
Hey, Kristen.

44:52.999 --> 44:53.999
- Oh, my God.
- All right. Take care.

44:55.999 --> 44:57.999
- I'll text you tomorrow,
all right?

44:57.999 --> 45:01.999
- I feel like I just got
an STD on my face.

45:03.999 --> 45:05.999
- Oi, you all right, babe?

45:05.999 --> 45:07.999
You can't always
get what you want,

45:07.999 --> 45:11.999
but then there's this case where
you get exactly what you want.

45:11.999 --> 45:13.999
Kristen and I are pretty good
right now.

45:13.999 --> 45:15.999
Lala and I are even better.

45:19.999 --> 45:23.999
- So I'm gonna go
for the golden ticket, Lala.

45:23.999 --> 45:25.999
Let's Netflix and chill.

45:25.999 --> 45:27.999
See what happens.

45:27.999 --> 45:29.999
Don't let them annoy you, yeah?

45:29.999 --> 45:32.999
- No. I'm over it.

45:32.999 --> 45:34.999
- Jesus, I didn't expect
any of this.

45:34.999 --> 45:35.999
What am I supposed to do?

45:35.999 --> 45:38.999
- You created it, darling.

45:38.999 --> 45:39.999
I have to say,

45:39.999 --> 45:43.999
out of all the people here
who have worked for me,

45:43.999 --> 45:45.999
I still haven't met two people

45:45.999 --> 45:49.999
that were more perfectly suited
than you and Stassi.

45:49.999 --> 45:51.999
- I'll always have
a soft spot for her.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.999
I always will.

45:54.999 --> 45:56.999
- Oh, so there's still
an opening, is there?

46:01.999 --> 46:04.000
- Did you think that Lisa
was gonna be like,

46:04.999 --> 46:05.999
"You're not welcomed here"?

46:05.999 --> 46:10.999
- Yes. So when I walked
in Lisa's house, it was nice--

46:10.999 --> 46:14.999
- Hi.

46:14.999 --> 46:17.999
- Hello. Hi.
- Stranger.

46:17.999 --> 46:20.999
I'd cheers you,
but you don't have a drink.

46:20.999 --> 46:21.999
- Do you want a drink?

46:21.999 --> 46:24.999
- I would love one.
- I'll get you one.

46:24.999 --> 46:27.999
- Thank you.

46:27.999 --> 46:29.999
Is that water?
- This is water.

46:29.999 --> 46:31.999
- Can I have some?
- It's getting late. Yeah.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.999
How are you?

46:35.999 --> 46:37.999
- I'm good.
I'm okay.

46:37.999 --> 46:39.999
How are you?
- I'm good.

46:39.999 --> 46:42.999
This has been a little bit
crazy of a night, huh?

46:42.999 --> 46:44.999
Not like the old days.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.999
You were my last, like,
really healthy relationship.

46:49.999 --> 46:51.999
- Did you just
use the word "healthy"?

46:51.999 --> 46:53.999
- In the beginning,
it was great.

46:53.999 --> 46:54.999
I thought at the beginning,
it was good.

46:54.999 --> 46:56.999
- I agree.
- You agree?

46:56.999 --> 46:58.999
- Looking at him, I see, like,

46:58.999 --> 47:01.999
all of these different versions
of myself.

47:01.999 --> 47:03.999
- Hey.

47:03.999 --> 47:05.999
- There was a time in my life

47:05.999 --> 47:08.000
where I was madly
in love with Jax.

47:08.999 --> 47:10.999
- Amazing, amazing.
You're a nice couple.

47:10.999 --> 47:12.999
- We've been through so much.

47:12.999 --> 47:14.999
I think you're a liar.

47:14.999 --> 47:16.999
Are you really not admitting
what you did wrong?

47:16.999 --> 47:18.999
- I did go to Vegas
and have relations

47:18.999 --> 47:20.999
with somebody else.

47:20.999 --> 47:23.999
- My whole family is upset
with what you've done.

47:23.999 --> 47:24.999
You're absolute sh**.

47:24.999 --> 47:27.999
What the hell was I thinking?

47:27.999 --> 47:32.999
Maybe it's time
to make things right.

47:32.999 --> 47:35.999
I hope I don't sound delusional
saying that.

47:35.999 --> 47:37.999
- You know,
I'll always care about you.

47:37.999 --> 47:39.999
If you needed something
tomorrow

47:39.999 --> 47:41.999
and you were like, "f***,

47:41.999 --> 47:43.999
I'm gonna have nobody else
to ask," I would be there.

47:43.999 --> 47:46.999
I would always be there.

47:46.999 --> 47:47.999
Always.

47:47.999 --> 47:53.999
- I actually
did not expect that.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.999
- Jax and Stassi
are over there talking.

47:55.999 --> 47:57.999
- Oh.

47:57.999 --> 47:58.999
- I'm actually--
like, I can't actually

47:58.999 --> 48:01.999
even believe I'm being, like,
really--

48:04.999 --> 48:07.999
I'm gonna be open with you
and vulnerable with you.

48:07.999 --> 48:09.999
- Okay.

48:09.999 --> 48:13.999
- There's something to be said
about history with people.

48:15.999 --> 48:17.999
We started this group together.

48:17.999 --> 48:19.999
- We did start this together,

48:19.999 --> 48:22.999
and I wouldn't have any of this
if it wasn't for you.

48:22.999 --> 48:24.999
I mean, yeah, we had a lot
of ups and downs,

48:24.999 --> 48:28.999
but I think I've learned
a lot from that relationship.

48:28.999 --> 48:29.999
- Well, I hope so.

48:29.999 --> 48:32.999
- That one year
of trying to, like,

48:32.999 --> 48:35.999
go back and forth with you
was brutal for me.

48:35.999 --> 48:37.999
Why can't you just
give me a chance?

48:37.999 --> 48:40.999
God, I f***ing love you,
for f***'s sake,

48:40.999 --> 48:42.999
to put your name
on my f***ing arm.

48:42.999 --> 48:44.999
- Don't ever tell me that I have
to forgive and forget,

48:44.999 --> 48:47.999
and don't ever tell me
that I should be over it by now.

48:47.999 --> 48:50.999
I can't go through this again.

48:50.999 --> 48:51.999
I was heartbroken.

48:51.999 --> 48:57.999
- But, like, you cheated
the whole time, so--

48:57.999 --> 48:58.999
- The whole time? No.

48:58.999 --> 49:01.999
- Most of it.
- It takes--listen.

49:01.999 --> 49:04.999
You were sh**y to me too.

49:04.999 --> 49:06.999
You were brutal.

49:06.999 --> 49:08.999
It was torture at the end.

49:08.999 --> 49:12.999
- You f***ed me over
a million times.

49:12.999 --> 49:15.999
Kristen had f***ed me over.

49:15.999 --> 49:18.999
- The problem I had was
that you'd come back after,

49:18.999 --> 49:21.999
like, you like,
disregarded everybody.

49:21.999 --> 49:25.999
- My main thing
was Katie and Schwartz.

49:25.999 --> 49:28.999
- But you're kind of
disrupting a whole group here.

49:28.999 --> 49:30.999
- How am I disrupting things?

49:30.999 --> 49:31.999
- I wouldn't show up
to someone's house

49:31.999 --> 49:33.999
who was--I wasn't invited to.

49:33.999 --> 49:36.999
- Katie has been
one of my best friends for--

49:36.999 --> 49:38.999
- And I understand that,
and what are your motives?

49:38.999 --> 49:40.999
Why are you back
all of a sudden?

49:40.999 --> 49:41.999
- Are you not paying attention
to what I'm saying?

49:41.999 --> 49:44.999
- I'm listening. Stop
attacking me before I even talk.

49:44.999 --> 49:45.999
- I'm--ugh, my God, Jax.

49:45.999 --> 49:47.999
- You had an ulterior motive.
- Then be honest.

49:47.999 --> 49:50.999
I want you to just say
whatever the f*** you think.

49:50.999 --> 49:52.999
- I think things didn't work out
with your boyfriend.

49:52.999 --> 49:58.000
You were like, "Sh**,
I lost all my friends.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.999
I need to, like,
crawl back in."

50:14.999 --> 50:17.999
- I think things didn't work out
with your boyfriend.

50:17.999 --> 50:21.999
you were like, "Sh**,
I lost all my friends.

50:21.999 --> 50:25.999
I need to, like,
crawl back in."

50:29.999 --> 50:33.000
I'm not here to hurt you
or be upset with you.

50:33.999 --> 50:35.999
I'm not.
There's no reason for that.

50:35.999 --> 50:39.999
You know, I've gone through
a couple bumps in the road,

50:39.999 --> 50:42.999
but I finally found
a great girl.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.999
- I really like Brittany.

50:45.999 --> 50:50.999
I really want you to not
f*** that sh** up.

50:50.999 --> 50:52.999
And I don't know
if you are capable

50:52.999 --> 50:56.999
of not f***ing sh** up.

50:56.999 --> 51:00.999
- I hate to say it,
but Stassi's probably right.

51:00.999 --> 51:03.999
I probably have been
treating Brittany unfairly.

51:03.999 --> 51:06.999
But she actually
was there for me.

51:06.999 --> 51:08.999
I just hope we get to a point
to where we're in the same room

51:08.999 --> 51:10.999
and can just say,
"Hey, what's going on?

51:10.999 --> 51:12.999
How are you?"

51:12.999 --> 51:13.999
It's been 2 1/2 years.

51:13.999 --> 51:15.999
I think we should be cordial.

51:15.999 --> 51:18.999
- Okay.
- Okay?

51:18.999 --> 51:21.999
So we're good?
- Mm-hmm.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.999
It's not 2011 anymore.

51:24.999 --> 51:29.999
Maybe enough time has passed
that we can be cool together.

51:29.999 --> 51:31.999
- Cheers.

51:44.999 --> 51:47.999
Can we go?
I want to go home.

51:47.999 --> 51:49.999
- Go home?

51:49.999 --> 51:52.999
- Yeah, let's go home.

51:52.999 --> 51:54.999
I love you.

51:54.999 --> 51:57.999
I'm gonna go home with Brittany
to our studio apartment.

51:57.999 --> 51:59.999
I want to try out those boobs.

51:59.999 --> 52:00.999
We're gonna be okay.

52:05.999 --> 52:07.999
- I'm glad you guys came.

52:07.999 --> 52:10.999
- I feel like such a weirdo
for saying this right now,

52:10.999 --> 52:13.999
but it's like I don't just want

52:13.999 --> 52:16.999
to be there
for your engagement party.

52:16.999 --> 52:20.999
- Well, to be honest,
I don't know how ready I am.

52:20.999 --> 52:22.999
That's not to say
we can't be friends again,

52:22.999 --> 52:27.999
but I'm just saying
I can't be the friend

52:27.999 --> 52:29.999
I was to you then.

52:30.999 --> 52:32.999
I used to get hurt a lot,

52:32.999 --> 52:35.999
because I was
just too trusting of people.

52:35.999 --> 52:38.999
- I'm so excited to be able
to hang out with you,

52:38.999 --> 52:42.999
but I know that it's gonna
take a while.

52:42.999 --> 52:44.999
- Lisa told me
to stand my ground

52:44.999 --> 52:48.999
but keep my heart open,
and I finally feel strong enough

52:48.999 --> 52:50.999
to be able to do
both of those things.

52:50.999 --> 52:53.999
I applaud your dress choice.

52:53.999 --> 52:55.999
- Really?
- Yes!

52:55.999 --> 52:58.999
- Do you know how hard it was
for me to choose something?

52:59.999 --> 53:02.999
- One more time, thank you.

53:02.999 --> 53:03.999
- All right. Bye, darling.
- Thanks again.

53:03.999 --> 53:05.999
- Thank you.
- Bye.

53:05.999 --> 53:09.999
- The only thing left to do now
is just go home

53:09.999 --> 53:12.999
and have sex
with my hot fiancée.

53:12.999 --> 53:13.999
As long as she's not tired.

53:13.999 --> 53:17.999
We'll see how we feel
when we get in there.

53:17.999 --> 53:18.999
Maybe order pizza or something.

53:18.999 --> 53:22.999
I miss Gordo so much.
- I miss Gordo.

53:22.999 --> 53:25.999
- Anyway, should we go home?
I'm exhausted.

53:25.999 --> 53:29.999
This year has been
a huge learning curve

53:29.999 --> 53:31.999
for these kids.

53:31.999 --> 53:35.999
Some have really made
some important steps.

53:35.999 --> 53:39.999
Some of them have gone
through some pretty dark days.

53:39.999 --> 53:42.999
Some have learned lessons
from their experiences.

53:42.999 --> 53:46.999
Unfortunately, I think there are
some that will never learn.

53:48.999 --> 53:52.999
I always say
the more things change,

53:52.999 --> 53:55.999
the more things stay the same.

53:58.999 --> 54:00.999
