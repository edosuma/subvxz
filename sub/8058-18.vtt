00:08.052 --> 00:09.720
God!
[Yelps]

00:09.754 --> 00:10.721
Sorry! Sorry!

00:10.755 --> 00:11.889
What's happening?

00:11.923 --> 00:13.057
I can't hear!

00:13.091 --> 00:14.658
And I'm dying!

00:14.692 --> 00:15.659
Baby, relax.

00:15.693 --> 00:16.827
I just wanted to surprise you.

00:16.861 --> 00:19.463
Open the bottom drawer
and read the cake.

00:21.699 --> 00:23.667
"Will you go to prom with me?"

00:23.701 --> 00:26.070
Well, this just keeps
getting weirder.

00:26.104 --> 00:27.704
Because of the merger,

00:27.739 --> 00:29.373
schools have had
to make some cuts,

00:29.407 --> 00:31.408
and the first thing to go
was the senior prom.

00:31.443 --> 00:33.744
So as a last-minute hail Mary,

00:33.778 --> 00:37.014
the parks department
is throwing prom for them.

00:37.048 --> 00:38.849
They also wanted
to cut A.P. Latin,

00:38.883 --> 00:40.584
so I volunteered to teach Latin.

00:40.618 --> 00:42.986
Which reminds me,
I need to learn Latin.

00:43.021 --> 00:45.155
I can't stop thinking
about that job in Chicago,

00:45.190 --> 00:47.424
and I think this prom
will be a good distraction.

00:47.459 --> 00:49.259
In my senior year
when I couldn't decide

00:49.294 --> 00:51.094
between Indiana and Amherst,

00:51.129 --> 00:53.097
I focused all my energy
on planning my prom,

00:53.131 --> 00:54.431
and it was the best prom ever.

00:54.466 --> 00:57.000
Plus, I made out with Harvey
from the A.V. Club.

00:57.035 --> 00:59.002
Hmm, I think
I'm jealous of Harvey.

00:59.037 --> 01:00.003
You shouldn't be.

01:00.038 --> 01:01.505
A few weeks later,
he almost died

01:01.539 --> 01:03.006
from a VCR electrocution.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.340
Legend has it

01:04.375 --> 01:06.009
that he can still
turn on a microwave

01:06.044 --> 01:07.244
just by blinking at it.

01:07.278 --> 01:08.245
The point is,

01:08.279 --> 01:10.047
will you go to the prom with me?

01:10.081 --> 01:11.882
Well, I thought
you'd never ask,

01:11.916 --> 01:13.450
because we're nearing 40.

01:13.485 --> 01:14.785
- [Chuckles]
- Course I will.

01:14.819 --> 01:17.121

01:37.342 --> 01:40.310
Okay, we are making progress,
prom committee.

01:40.345 --> 01:42.579
Now, our budget
is basically zero,

01:42.614 --> 01:44.415
so we're gonna need
to cover all the jobs

01:44.449 --> 01:46.150
that we would normally
hire people for.

01:46.184 --> 01:48.152
Tom, you're in charge of music.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.654
Oh, man.
Well, all right.

01:50.688 --> 01:52.656
Aw, did you want to DJ,
little puppy?

01:52.690 --> 01:54.491
I didn't know
that little puppies

01:54.526 --> 01:57.161
could operate an iPod
with their little puppy paws.

01:57.195 --> 01:58.829
Eew and boo.

01:58.863 --> 02:00.664
This kind of thing is getting
out of hand with you two.

02:00.698 --> 02:02.466
Y'all are on official warning.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.635
I did DJ a little
back in the day.

02:04.669 --> 02:07.004
I had a show called
"Zoot Suit Wyatt"

02:07.038 --> 02:08.338
on Carleton College radio.

02:08.372 --> 02:09.840
Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M.,

02:09.874 --> 02:11.342
I was the king of swing.

02:11.376 --> 02:13.343
I thought
we as a culture agreed

02:13.378 --> 02:15.345
to forget the year
that everyone was into swing.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.247
Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ
with Tom.

02:17.282 --> 02:18.816
- [Whispers] Yes.
- What! No!

02:18.850 --> 02:20.484
If you eclipse my flavor
in any way,

02:20.518 --> 02:21.685
we'll have a problem.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.086
All right, Allison,
you are in charge

02:23.121 --> 02:24.288
of choosing the prom theme,

02:24.322 --> 02:26.523
and now it has to be perfect
and magical

02:26.558 --> 02:28.525
and look like a million bucks
but cost zero bucks.

02:28.560 --> 02:29.860
So what do you got?

02:29.894 --> 02:32.362
I was thinking the theme
could be "Fairy tale."

02:32.397 --> 02:34.437
The theater department
did <i> Into the Woods</i> last year,

02:34.466 --> 02:35.799
and we still have the scenery.

02:35.834 --> 02:37.801
I laid out
some preliminary plans

02:37.836 --> 02:38.836
in this binder.

02:38.870 --> 02:40.838
Wow!

02:40.872 --> 02:43.774
Are those jense-trodder
color tabs?

02:43.808 --> 02:45.042
I thought those
were discontinued.

02:45.076 --> 02:46.043
They were.

02:46.077 --> 02:47.111
I had to order them

02:47.145 --> 02:48.312
through some Mexican
back channels.

02:48.346 --> 02:50.180
Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?

02:50.215 --> 02:51.515
I thought
they went out of business.

02:51.549 --> 02:53.549
They did, but they opened up
a new one in Oaxaca.

02:53.551 --> 02:55.719
What is happening right now?

02:55.754 --> 02:57.554
Okay, everybody
get back to work.

02:57.589 --> 02:59.556
And, Allison,
come by my office later

02:59.591 --> 03:01.625
so we can keep crushing it.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.460
All right,
let's go over our set list.

03:03.495 --> 03:05.529
- Set list? No need.
- So, what,

03:05.563 --> 03:07.731
you're just gonna put your iPod
on shuffle?

03:07.766 --> 03:09.333
No, but I could.
You want to know why?

03:09.367 --> 03:10.667
[Sighs]

03:10.702 --> 03:12.836
Because every single song
you own is a banger?

03:12.871 --> 03:14.638
Every song I download

03:14.672 --> 03:16.473
has to pass a series
of rigorous tests

03:16.508 --> 03:19.143
to answer one simple question:

03:19.177 --> 03:20.477
Is it a banger?

03:20.512 --> 03:21.578
How many beats per minute?

03:21.613 --> 03:22.679
How many drops?

03:22.714 --> 03:24.314
How dope are the drops?

03:24.349 --> 03:26.050
Were any acoustic instruments
used?

03:26.084 --> 03:28.352
If so, it is not a banger.

03:28.386 --> 03:30.721
I once accidentally downloaded
a Lumineers song.

03:30.755 --> 03:32.689
I had to throw away
my whole computer

03:32.724 --> 03:33.924
just to be safe.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.559
I feel like, to me,

03:35.593 --> 03:37.761
set list flow is very important.

03:37.796 --> 03:39.897
I mean,
we're basically vibe curators.

03:39.931 --> 03:41.331
Ugh. Oh, no.

03:41.366 --> 03:43.500

to be seen together.

about taking it.

06:27.832 --> 06:29.166
is a personal friend.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.869
He's always looking
for bright young employees

06:31.903 --> 06:34.872
to give money to
in exchange for honest work.

06:34.906 --> 06:36.140
That would be awesome.

06:36.174 --> 06:37.574
I definitely need money
for school.

06:37.609 --> 06:38.609
Oh, really?

06:38.643 --> 06:39.777
Is it worth a few bucks

06:39.811 --> 06:41.245
to get a million splinters
in your fingers

06:41.279 --> 06:43.614
and then cut off your fingers
accidentally,

06:43.648 --> 06:45.949
'cause that will happen.

06:45.984 --> 06:49.586
I have tolerated Leslie's
pro-government ways

06:49.621 --> 06:52.256
because her annoying kindness
and generosity

06:52.290 --> 06:54.558
sneakily made me like her
as a person.

06:54.593 --> 06:57.628
But I draw the line
at corrupting America's youth.

06:57.662 --> 06:59.763
I'm sure I can get Allison a job

06:59.798 --> 07:01.432
at Tim Hautner's sawmill.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.767
I once did him a favor.

07:03.802 --> 07:05.869
I built his sawmill.

07:05.904 --> 07:07.371
I may be
leaving this office soon.

07:07.405 --> 07:09.907
I need to plant seeds
for the next generation.

07:09.941 --> 07:11.875

07:11.910 --> 07:13.377
become department directors.

- All this stuff is free.
- No, it's not.

07:40.756 --> 07:42.190
Why'd you pay for a limo?

07:42.224 --> 07:43.458
Because it's prom.

07:43.492 --> 07:44.759
If you don't show up in a limo,

07:44.793 --> 07:45.993
legally, they can't let you in.

07:46.028 --> 07:47.729
Does your mom want
to take pictures?

07:47.763 --> 07:49.464
Uh, yeah, she does.
