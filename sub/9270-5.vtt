00:11.180 --> 00:12.610
Well played, Captain.

00:12.660 --> 00:13.850
Well done, brother.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.130
Congratulations.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.010
Bravo, bravo.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.930
Nice one, old man.

01:09.580 --> 01:11.290
A gentleman and a player.

01:11.340 --> 01:12.880
Hear, hear.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.650
Are you all right, Vince?

01:15.820 --> 01:18.160
You done the old man proud.

01:19.060 --> 01:20.890
Shall I say a prayer?

01:20.940 --> 01:23.810
Nice try, Brown,
but as a devout atheist, I think

01:23.860 --> 01:26.490
my brother would prefer to be
remembered

01:26.540 --> 01:28.610
~ with this.
~ Oh, yes.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.490
Chateau Laponte.

01:30.540 --> 01:34.970
One of his last two bottles.
It seemed a fitting occasion.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.360
Indeed.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.570
Wish me luck?

01:42.620 --> 01:45.930
He'd be turning in his grave if he
could see the state of the team.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.090
No captain. Chairman AWOL.

01:48.140 --> 01:51.010
Monty's in the Commonwealth
with Her Majesty.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.770
I did some wicket keeping
in my seminary days.

01:53.820 --> 01:56.170
Perhaps you could
step in for your husband.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.490
Whip them all into shape.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.690
~ She's a woman!
~ Commendable powers
of observation, Major.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.650
Women don't know
anything about cricket.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.810
Actually, I'm not completely
clueless.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.650
Hear, hear. That's settled, then.

02:07.700 --> 02:08.889
You're in charge.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.610
Bloody lunacy.

02:23.420 --> 02:24.820
Howzat?!

02:33.100 --> 02:34.890
I've just been admiring the ground.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.530
Although I'm curious,
Professor Milton, as to why it says

02:37.580 --> 02:40.610
Hambleston CC above the pavilion?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.170
These acres were once
the site of a boundary

02:43.220 --> 02:45.730
dispute between Lord Hambleston
and the Earl of Montague.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.650
Generations of infighting.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.890
It all got frightfully tedious so
they reached a gentlemen's
agreement.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.330
An annual cricket match,

02:52.380 --> 02:56.050
with the winning side claiming
ownership for the following year.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.730
Over time,
it became this ground here.

02:58.780 --> 03:01.370
It's our local derby.
Fiercely fought.

03:01.420 --> 03:03.420
And a week tomorrow.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.210
All prepared, milady?

03:06.260 --> 03:09.360
I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage.

03:09.460 --> 03:11.850
Max Scullion. Your new neighbour.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.290
Oh, of course.

03:13.340 --> 03:17.050
Geordie Hambleston's yet another
victim of Mr Atlee's death duties.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.250
Mr Scullion is the new
owner of the estate.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.090
You must dine with me next week.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.930
It would be my pleasure.

03:23.980 --> 03:25.290
Welcome to Kembleford.

03:25.340 --> 03:29.610
Thank you. Although we are
technically on Hambleston soil.

03:29.660 --> 03:31.250
Nine years in a row to be exact.

03:31.300 --> 03:32.770
Are you a cricketer?

03:32.820 --> 03:35.890
Don't know one end of a bat from
the other but I like a challenge,

03:35.940 --> 03:38.810
and my team's coming
together nicely.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.680
Which is more than can be
said for yours.

04:18.060 --> 04:19.410
Is this it?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.930
Fred Pebble's out with a gammy leg.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.450
Vince Lennon?

04:23.500 --> 04:25.210
Said he'd be along.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.970
If he's got time.

04:27.020 --> 04:29.690
Which means we're only eight men.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.250
Um... If you're looking for
volunteers,

04:34.300 --> 04:37.900
I'm told I was quite a handy
leg break in my youth.

04:40.660 --> 04:41.690
Thank you, Father.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.340
It seems we face an uphill task.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.930
Forgive the intrusion.
Raj Chandraty.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.570
Dr Fairfax's locum.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.690
Oh, of course.

04:50.740 --> 04:53.330
Mrs McCarthy informs me
you are looking for players.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.490
Your arrival couldn't be
more timely.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.250
No, no. Wait just a minute.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.370
Shouldn't we be discussing amongst
ourselves whether he's suitable?

05:00.420 --> 05:03.610
I assume you wouldn't be here
if not a player.

05:03.660 --> 05:06.010
I was an amateur
for the Jaipur Maharajas.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.610
Before that, captain of
the University of Calcutta XI.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.130
And we short a captain.
How very propitious.

05:11.180 --> 05:15.730
Steady on. Surely there's someone
more officer material.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.180
Well, like this fellow here?

05:18.380 --> 05:21.050
I second Lady Felicia's proposal.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.810
Welcome on board, Doctor.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.690
Hear, hear! Welcome.

05:24.740 --> 05:27.540
I've a feeling we'll be needing you.

05:28.020 --> 05:31.210
This is Major Peter Wallander.
Club Secretary.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.930
How do you do?

05:43.540 --> 05:45.490
You're late. The meeting's over.

05:45.540 --> 05:48.410
Then, do you need any odd jobs doing?

05:49.900 --> 05:51.490
You're sacked.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.530
And if I catch you
sniffing round my house again,

05:54.580 --> 05:56.570
I'll knock you to hell and back.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.090
I think you have an audience.

06:01.660 --> 06:03.060
Morning.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.930
This is Vince Lennon.

06:05.980 --> 06:09.370
Demon fast bowler and our best
hope of victory against Hambleston.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.570
Vince. This is your new captain.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.090
They made the punka wallah
team captain?

06:15.140 --> 06:17.410
Bet that went down well
with Major Blimp.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.570
Watch your mouth, Lennon, unless you
want to find yourself in more
trouble.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.820
No offence intended.
See you around, Doc.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.380
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

07:15.220 --> 07:17.810
And I think three dozen
of my scones.

07:17.860 --> 07:21.050
We wouldn't want to run
out like we did last year.

07:21.100 --> 07:23.300
Or the year before that.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.080
Holy Mother of God!

07:31.220 --> 07:32.450
Amen.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.450
Get this to the lab, please,
Sergeant.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.970
Yes, sir.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.410
I was thinking the same thing.

07:48.820 --> 07:50.450
Don't tell me.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.490
I can now add telepathy
to your list of abilities?

07:53.540 --> 07:57.660
That's an exit wound.
The body was turned over.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.010
Curiously formal, don't you think?

08:03.260 --> 08:06.570
And then... they washed his face.

08:06.620 --> 08:10.120
I think I can draw my own
conclusions, thank you.

08:12.540 --> 08:15.890
Do you happen to know
who his next of kin is?

08:15.940 --> 08:17.610
Jane Milton.

08:17.660 --> 08:21.380
Professor Milton is
Vince Lennon's next of kin?

08:23.340 --> 08:25.300
I'm afraid so.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.970
He was eight.

08:30.420 --> 08:33.090
An evacuee from some godforsaken
slum where he'd never known

08:33.140 --> 08:35.080
anything but abuse.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.090
When his family were
killed in a bombing raid, my brother

08:40.140 --> 08:42.179
and I adopted him.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.970
That was very altruistic.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.480
Humane.

08:51.100 --> 08:55.300
Vince was, well,
he was a very damaged child.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.210
Filthy and malnourished.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.330
Almost feral at first.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.290
We thought that with enough time

09:03.340 --> 09:08.620
and love he could become
a valuable member of society.

09:11.460 --> 09:19.460
That nurture could triumph over
nature and love could conquer all.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.730
Your brother,
he took his own life last year.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.930
Do you mind me asking why?

09:25.980 --> 09:29.180
The only one that can
answer that is Charles.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.010
Do the police know who was
responsible?

09:34.060 --> 09:37.610
Vince Lennon collected enemies
the way other people collect stamps.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.890
So I expect it will be a while to
work their way through the list.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.890
In the meantime, to be brutally
practical, we've lost our fast

09:43.940 --> 09:47.010
bowler - I'm hoping you or the
inspector may provide a bit of pace.

09:47.060 --> 09:49.290
Are you something
of an expert, Your Ladyship?

09:49.340 --> 09:51.730
Oh, gosh. Hardly. Although I do have
six older brothers

09:51.780 --> 09:53.810
so something may have sunk in.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.090
Sorry to interrupt. I think there's
something you should see.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.580
Come on.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.920
I suppose it's appropriate.

10:03.940 --> 10:06.410
Although Vince would hate it.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.290
Do you think they'd all be shocked
if I laid him

10:11.340 --> 10:13.680
to rest in a bomber jacket?

10:14.260 --> 10:18.060
I don't think you've ever given
a jot for convention.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.130
If you're investigating,
I should tell you the police already

10:22.180 --> 10:24.520
searched and found nothing.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.120
Maybe they were
looking in the wrong place.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.040
Missal.

10:38.780 --> 10:41.770
Vince hasn't attended mass
since he was 16.

10:41.820 --> 10:44.970
I suppose it didn't help us
both being atheists.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.380
But we could hardly deny him
his birth religion.

10:49.420 --> 10:54.850
Initials, dates, amounts,
Â£15, Â£15, Â£25.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.970
These aren't odd jobs.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.010
And this.

11:13.460 --> 11:14.930
Blackmail?

11:16.460 --> 11:18.050
Does it say who they are?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.770
Only initials.

11:20.660 --> 11:24.460
OM. PW. LB.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.820
The payments from OM
stop a year ago.

11:32.020 --> 11:34.620
You think one of them sent this?

11:34.740 --> 11:38.090
Well, someone "settled the matter"
for once and for all.

11:42.700 --> 11:45.100
Did you see that specialist?

11:45.740 --> 11:46.940
Yes.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.740
He said I'd outlive you!

11:53.140 --> 11:55.880
We have to give this to the police.

11:57.180 --> 11:59.050
I suppose we must.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.380
I sense a "but".

12:02.060 --> 12:06.060
Even if one of them is the murderer,
what of the others?

12:06.500 --> 12:10.200
The police will have to track them
down, poor souls.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.860
All those secrets laid bare.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.660
Lives ruined.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.980
I see you have some new players?

12:30.380 --> 12:31.850
Local men, are they?

12:31.900 --> 12:35.730
Australia. Cattlemen hired to
work on my estate.

12:35.780 --> 12:38.690
I'm surprised to see you at practice
under the circumstances.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.570
Victory is the offspring
of preparation and opportunity.

12:42.620 --> 12:45.010
The murdered boy was
a member of our team.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.610
Like I said.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.000
Howzat!

12:50.980 --> 12:53.860
~ Howzat.
~ Thank you, Doctor.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.560
May I introduce our new captain,
Raj Chandraty?

12:59.900 --> 13:04.200
Looks like I'm not the only one with
a foreigner on his team.

13:05.460 --> 13:07.330
I'll see you at dinner
tonight, milady.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.450
I look forward to it.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.250
He doesn't have
cattle on his estate.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.330
I'm so glad you could come.

13:16.380 --> 13:18.980
It beats sitting at home moping.

13:19.700 --> 13:23.370
And I confess my curiosity
as to what the opposition are up to.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.760
Ringers on the team indeed.

13:26.700 --> 13:30.890
It seems like a lot of effort
for a village cricket match.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.490
Is there a Mrs Scullion?

13:32.540 --> 13:36.340
Three. Scattered all round
the country. Bleeding me dry.

13:37.540 --> 13:38.890
You been married long?

13:38.940 --> 13:40.410
Two years.

13:41.860 --> 13:44.730
I'd keep an eye on her
if I were you.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.170
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

13:52.220 --> 13:53.360
PW.

13:55.260 --> 13:59.020
How's the investigation going?
Have you found the murder weapon?

14:00.620 --> 14:03.170
We've only identified
the make as of yet.

14:03.220 --> 14:07.860
Walther P38. The country's awash
with ruddy war souvenirs.

14:09.860 --> 14:12.000
I'm afraid I can't say.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.330
Bit of a blow losing your
star player.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.690
I'm sure our new captain will
make up the deficit.

14:17.740 --> 14:19.170
May the best side win.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.930
I'm surprised you're all being

14:20.980 --> 14:24.080
so casual about your tenth defeat
in a row.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.800
You don't know?

14:28.540 --> 14:29.650
Know what?

14:29.700 --> 14:33.970
I suggest you take a look
at the original articles of 1783.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.490
Should either side be
victor for ten successive years,

14:37.540 --> 14:40.840
they claim ownership
of the land in perpetuity.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.730
~ Did you know about this?
~ No, I didn't.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.890
But the ground's been shared by
both villages for centuries.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.530
It's a gentlemen's agreement.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.860
In that case,
I'm glad I'm not a gentleman.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.850
Shall I bring my sewing basket
and join you?

15:01.900 --> 15:04.100
I prefer my own company.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.770
Is that why you slept
in your dressing room last night?

15:07.820 --> 15:10.090
I didn't want to
intrude on your grief.

15:10.140 --> 15:14.770
For the umpteenth time there was
nothing between me and Vince Lennon.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.290
Why won't you believe me?

15:16.340 --> 15:18.170
I prefer the evidence
of my own eyes.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.570
Talking. You saw us talking.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.090
It didn't look like you were
discussing the windows.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.650
What exactly were you talking about?

15:26.700 --> 15:30.220
His money.
He said he was five shillings short.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.930
Little Bear misses Daddy Bear.

15:38.580 --> 15:40.250
Good morning.

15:40.820 --> 15:44.020
Good morning, Father.
I'll fetch us some tea.

15:45.660 --> 15:48.660
No prizes for guessing why
you're here.

15:51.700 --> 15:52.730
What(?!)

15:52.780 --> 15:55.930
This is what happens when you put
a woman and a darkie in charge.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.770
If Scullion thinks we are going
to take this lying down...

15:58.820 --> 16:01.410
I'm here about Vince.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.330
If you want me to go to the funeral
you're wasting your breath.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.450
He was a blackmailer.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.780
Doesn't surprise me.
Crooked as a dog's hind leg.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.700
He identified one of his victims
by the initials PW.

16:19.140 --> 16:22.490
If you think that low life
would extort money...

16:22.540 --> 16:24.530
I'd have knocked him to hell
and back first.

16:24.580 --> 16:27.450
So you said,
the day he was murdered.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.450
I didn't kill him.
Although I wish I had.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.970
He was sniffing round my wife.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.370
I see.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.450
How long had Vince been
blackmailing you?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.570
Does my husband know?

16:50.620 --> 16:52.370
No.

16:52.420 --> 16:54.490
And I won't tell him.

16:55.540 --> 16:58.010
Or anything else you tell me.

17:00.940 --> 17:02.410
How did you find out?

17:02.460 --> 17:08.460
He referred to one of his victims
as LB. Little Bear?

17:11.819 --> 17:14.089
It's what Peter calls me.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.010
At least, he used to.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.960
Vince liked to mimic...

17:20.339 --> 17:25.849
He was vile and I'm glad he's dead.
At least...

17:25.900 --> 17:27.900
Your secret is safe?

17:33.740 --> 17:39.420
"Kept woman" sounds so much better
than whore, don't you think?

17:43.220 --> 17:47.260
My first husband died in the war.

17:49.380 --> 17:55.060
And I was all but destitute when
a "gentleman" offered me a lifeline.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.850
What price virtue?

17:58.900 --> 18:04.100
Well, in my case, a flat in
Maida Vale, a quarterly allowance...

18:06.460 --> 18:09.260
.. and the loss of all self respect.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.730
Peter had no idea.

18:13.780 --> 18:19.780
He rescued me. He gave me
everything I've ever wanted.

18:20.780 --> 18:28.580
Security, respectability,
and above all - unconditional love.

18:29.700 --> 18:35.660
In which case, if you confess,
he will be able to forgive you.

18:37.820 --> 18:40.820
And the proudest and the most
stubborn.

18:44.860 --> 18:47.860
He'd never be able to forgive such
deceit.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.770
He'd leave me.

18:52.820 --> 18:55.290
And then my heart would break.

19:08.260 --> 19:09.530
Sir.

19:09.580 --> 19:12.410
I just took a telephone call with
information on the Lennon murder.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.010
What kind of information?

19:14.060 --> 19:16.000
The anonymous kind.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.490
Go on.

19:18.540 --> 19:20.650
"Why don't you find
out what the good doctor was

19:20.700 --> 19:23.610
"burying in his garden
on Thursday night?

19:23.660 --> 19:26.730
"That's what happens when you let...
his sort..."

19:26.780 --> 19:29.290
Yes, Sergeant. Thank you.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.480
I think I get the gist.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.770
Have you handed in that book?

19:44.820 --> 19:47.820
I've just come
from the police station.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.800
And you've been sleuthing,
so spill the beans.

19:53.380 --> 19:54.970
Is PW Peter Wallander?

19:55.020 --> 19:56.160
No.

19:57.700 --> 20:00.240
But you've found out something.

20:01.100 --> 20:05.570
I think the initials refer to
nicknames.

20:05.620 --> 20:10.330
Vince was fond of his nicknames.
The crueller the better, usually.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.700
Yes.

20:12.780 --> 20:16.220
So, if PW isn't Peter Wallander...?

20:18.700 --> 20:21.570
I think I can make
an educated guess.

20:25.220 --> 20:28.370
If you think I killed him,
you are mistaken.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.930
I'm a physician.
I took an oath to save lives.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.650
Not take them.

20:33.620 --> 20:36.170
You still haven't
answered my question.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.160
With respect,
that's a private matter.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.810
Well, if the police make
the same deduction,

20:43.860 --> 20:46.800
it will no longer be
a private matter.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.490
For another's sake,
I can only pray that won't happen.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.680
An affair of the heart?

20:55.740 --> 20:58.480
You mistake me for a man of honour.

21:00.420 --> 21:03.520
Yet I breached the sacred
bonds of marriage.

21:04.420 --> 21:07.740
I disgraced myself
and betrayed my gods.

21:36.980 --> 21:39.650
I said search, not destroy,
Sergeant.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.410
Am I allowed to ask what you're
looking for?

21:42.460 --> 21:44.730
I can't say. I'm sorry.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.540
Sir.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.800
I have never seen
that before in my life.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.330
So, I followed them back into town.

22:11.380 --> 22:13.450
Back, as in back to the Red Lion?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.970
Guilty as charged, Mrs M.

22:15.020 --> 22:19.050
There you are, Father. There's been
a development. Carry on, Sid.

22:19.100 --> 22:22.490
Turns out they're surveyors
for the Ministry of Transport.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.930
Scullion is selling off his land
for a dual carriageway.

22:25.980 --> 22:27.970
The blaggard!

22:28.020 --> 22:32.050
The only spanner in the works is the
five acres of land he doesn't own.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.450
Yet.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.440
The cricket ground.

22:36.220 --> 22:39.770
He has got an absolute fortune
riding on that match tomorrow.

22:39.820 --> 22:43.620
And with Vince gone our only hope
is the good doctor.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.130
Vince Lennon was a blackmailer.

22:48.180 --> 22:50.730
We believe he was lured
to his death by one of his victims.

22:50.780 --> 22:54.060
I have to ask, was
he blackmailing you?

22:55.820 --> 22:57.090
Yes.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.890
Why?

22:58.940 --> 23:02.010
I give you my word it isn't
relevant.

23:02.060 --> 23:05.220
This is a murder investigation.
I'll need more than that.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.090
It involves a third party.

23:11.220 --> 23:14.340
Then, do you have an
alibi for the night of the murder?

23:15.700 --> 23:16.970
No.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.290
~ Not now.
~ From Father Brown, sir.

23:20.340 --> 23:22.610
You may want to see this.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.610
I'm halting
the interview for a tea break.

23:32.660 --> 23:35.050
White, no sugar,
and one for the prisoner.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.570
Yes, sir.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.770
Can I speak to you off the record?

23:43.900 --> 23:46.490
It seems Max Scullion has a deal
worth a fortune

23:46.540 --> 23:48.450
resting on that match tomorrow.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.410
Which makes the discovery of the gun

23:50.460 --> 23:55.490
and the arrest of the opposition
captain very timely.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.530
You think this was Scullion's work?

23:57.580 --> 23:59.850
I'd stake my job on it.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.570
But until we get the ballistics
back on that gun

24:02.620 --> 24:05.770
and unless you can give me
an alibi for the night in question,

24:05.820 --> 24:10.100
I'll have no choice
but to place you under arrest.

24:11.340 --> 24:13.770
An Indian and a white woman.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.450
One whiff of association
and she would lose everything.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.850
Husband, home, children.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.700
She'll be cast out, a social pariah.

24:23.220 --> 24:26.020
I have disgraced her enough already.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.770
'So, let's get this right.'

24:28.820 --> 24:33.010
If we lose this match,
he builds a ruddy great road right

24:33.060 --> 24:34.970
through the middle
of our cricket ground?

24:35.020 --> 24:37.810
My lawyer says that though ancient,
the clause is watertight

24:37.860 --> 24:39.330
and binding.

24:39.380 --> 24:40.450
Then we're doomed.

24:40.500 --> 24:46.170
Nine men, star player murdered,
captain banged up in a prison cell.

24:46.220 --> 24:50.020
No-one blames you, Inspector.
This is Scullion's work.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.130
I do.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.930
Right, Sid's opening the bowling.
Sergeant Goodfellow in square leg.

24:55.980 --> 24:59.330
Bill, I've put you in first slip.
Not too much running.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.090
Inspector. Wicket keeper.

25:01.140 --> 25:03.090
I'll be requiring you to
step up as captain.

25:03.140 --> 25:05.210
It would be
