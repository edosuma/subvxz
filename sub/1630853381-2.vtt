WEBVTT

00:54.846 --> 00:57.265
Is that the lyric?

00:58.558 --> 01:00.226
- I think so. Or it should be.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.770
Whatever you said, I loved.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.355
- You know,
I actually have always thought

01:04.439 --> 01:05.774
I'd be an excellent songwriter.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.776
- You would.
You really would. I mean--

01:34.219 --> 01:36.137
- So sorry
I keep having to pee.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.806
I have a really small bladder.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.808
I mean, I think.
I guess I don't know.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.809
- No, it's fine.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.477
I love these big rest stops.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.729
It's my favorite part
of being on the road.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.983
Yes.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.402
Oh, this is great!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.947
Ooh, ooh, you want some
unsalted sunflower seeds?

01:55.448 --> 01:56.825
- No. Do you?

01:56.908 --> 01:58.117
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.202
These are high in protein,

01:59.285 --> 02:00.662
rich in vitamin B1,

02:00.745 --> 02:02.080
and the only thing
in these kind of places

02:02.163 --> 02:03.665
that isn't lard or sugar.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.543
- No. I'm cool--I'm cool, yeah.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.044
I'm just gonna go to--
I'm gonna head--

02:08.127 --> 02:10.088
I'm gonna find the, um--
you know, I'm gonna--

02:11.172 --> 02:12.507
Yeah, I'll be back.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.140
- Oh, Jesus.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.517
Hello.
- Hey.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.185
So that whole plan
about me staying away

02:24.269 --> 02:26.354
from Deborah,
the opposite is happening.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.398
We left Vegas last night,
and now I'm trapped

02:28.481 --> 02:31.025
in a car with her,
and she's being nice.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.235
- Nice?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.611
Jesus, that is
fucking terrifying.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.363
All right, look,
I finally got Janet Stone

02:35.446 --> 02:37.198
to call me back, and she's
agreed to have lunch tomorrow.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.242
So I'm gonna do
everything in my power

02:39.325 --> 02:41.536
to make your stupid email
go away, okay?

02:41.619 --> 02:42.912
Just sit tight.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.123
- Okay, when you have
an update, call me.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.130
Hi.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.090
- I'm Daniel.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.800
- Hi, Daniel.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.927
- Hello.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.766
- Hm.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.818
- You're famous, right?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.278
- Apparently not.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.321
- Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, yeah.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.197
You're the funny lady.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.241
Oh, my God. Um...

03:20.325 --> 03:21.826
- Deborah Vance. Hi.
- Yes!

03:21.910 --> 03:23.828
- I'm your biggest fan.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.371
What the heck
are you doing here?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.915
- Well, actually,
I'm doing a drop-in set

03:26.998 --> 03:28.499
at The Main
in Flagstaff tonight.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.126
Are you coming to see it?
- Oh, no.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.753
I'm headed the other direction.

03:31.836 --> 03:33.963
I'm going to help my brother
inseminate his horses.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.506
- Sounds like fun.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.592
- Can I get a picture?
- Absolutely.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.385
- Okay. Here we go.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.597
- Oh, God, not down there.
What are you, a sadist?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.432
There we go.
- Oh, okay.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
- Gas station sunglasses?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.652
- Don't be a snob.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.196
It's not about the label.
It's about the fit.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.822
See, now, like, I have

03:59.906 --> 04:01.783
a classic heart-shaped face.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.034
Perfect.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.494
So I want to mimic that
with glasses

04:04.577 --> 04:05.912
that are kind of wider
at the top

04:05.995 --> 04:07.413
and a little bit narrower
at the bottom,

04:07.497 --> 04:09.499
like...

04:09.582 --> 04:10.625
mm, these.

04:10.708 --> 04:11.751
Look.

04:14.545 --> 04:15.838
- Okay, wow, yeah.
- Right?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.173
Now, you, on the other hand,

04:17.257 --> 04:18.716
have a more oval face.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.260
Kind of like a Jordan almond.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.973
So you need to contrast that
with something more angular.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.808
Like, um...

04:26.891 --> 04:28.184
oh, here, try these.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.026
- Wow.
- Huh? Very cute.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.569
Keep 'em. They're yours.
My treat.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.613
- Oh, that's nice--
you don't have to do that.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.740
- They're $4.99.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.826
- Okay, thank you.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.494
- You're welcome.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.248
- Classic.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.173
- You bought a reusable cup?

04:59.257 --> 05:01.843
- Yeah, well, you know,
it offsets my private jet.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.518
- Morning.
- Good morning, Jimmy.

05:10.601 --> 05:12.353
- Well, lucky you.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.564
Last two assistants
got promoted off this desk.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.899
- Big whoop. Who cares?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.860
- Kayla, I think this is good
for both of us, you know?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.863
- You're giving me a migraine.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.156
What?

05:23.239 --> 05:24.782
I mean, Latitude.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.075
- Have a good day.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.994
- I won't.

05:28.077 --> 05:29.662
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Morning, Silas.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.872
- Good morning, Mr. LuSaque.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.582
- Oh, you can call me Jimmy.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.750
- Okay.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.878
- Perfect.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.129
- Good.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.672
So I got you
a table for your lunch

05:39.756 --> 05:41.299
with Janet Stone at Superba.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.384
I read in "The Hollywood
Reporter's" Power Lunch List

05:43.468 --> 05:45.094
that she loves
their Little Gem Caesar salad.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.679
- Kayla said
they were fully booked.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.556
- They are, but I bartered
with Michael's assistant

05:48.639 --> 05:50.016
to get a standing reservation.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.517
I have to cover his desk
for a couple days

05:51.601 --> 05:53.352
next month,
but it's no problem.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.645
- Thank you so much.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.898
- Also, I heard a ding
on your end

05:56.981 --> 05:58.316
when we were
on the phone this morning,

05:58.399 --> 05:59.692
and so I called Audi
and they think

05:59.776 --> 06:01.069
it's the check engine
indicator light.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.403
So I've arranged
for them to come

06:02.487 --> 06:03.654
pick it up here
tomorrow morning,

06:03.738 --> 06:05.114
and it'll be done by EOD.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.574
They can send a loaner,

06:06.657 --> 06:07.825
or I'd be happy to drive you
to your lunch.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.368
- You heard a ding?
- Yes.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.828
- And then you called Audi?
- Yes.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.246
- You preemptively
called Audi for me?

06:12.330 --> 06:14.916
- Yes.
- Oh, you know what?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.250
I would love a ride.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.710
- I look forward to it...

06:17.794 --> 06:19.170
Jimmy.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.466
- Okay.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.391
- Yeah, yeah.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.936
Your own sister.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.188
Sleeping with your husband.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.273
Someone so close to you.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.566
Someone you trust.

06:41.692 --> 06:45.738
Betrayal is
the worst feeling in the world.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.659
And I've woken up
during a colonoscopy.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.626
- We bust our asses for 10%.

06:58.709 --> 07:02.004
We should get 90
and give the clients 10.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.339
- Totally. Totally.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.133
So like I was saying before,

07:05.216 --> 07:06.634
that email
being used for the show

07:06.717 --> 07:08.970
would be very bad
for both of my clients.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.263
- Come on.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.140
You know how these things work.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.975
It'll be months
before that show comes out,

07:14.058 --> 07:16.185
and even then,
Deborah would have to see it

07:16.269 --> 07:18.688
and think it's about her.
Don't worry.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.731
- I think she thinks
most things are about her.

07:20.815 --> 07:21.732
- Ha!

07:21.816 --> 07:23.985
- Look, I really wouldn't ask

07:24.068 --> 07:26.404
if it wasn't really,
really important to me

07:26.487 --> 07:28.739
and my mental
and physical health.

07:28.823 --> 07:32.118
- Mmm. Yum.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.828
Jimmy, I like you.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.165
All right,
I'll talk to Daisy and Jesse,

07:37.248 --> 07:39.000
scare 'em
with some libel law shit.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.043
I'll make sure
that it's not at all traceable

07:41.127 --> 07:42.044
to Deborah or the kid.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
- Ah, thank you so much.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.214
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.632
I really--I owe you big time.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.884
- My pleasure.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.011
- Oh, I just have water.
It's bad luck.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.804
- Come on.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.764
Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.603
Mmm.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.564
- I don't usually drink
at lunch,

08:01.647 --> 08:04.358
but I finally closed
on my house this morning.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.860
- Oh, that's great.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.737
I mean, the housing market
is insane in LA.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.197
I've been looking
forever, actually.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.615
I made one offer,
but the house turned out

08:10.698 --> 08:11.908
to be a nightmare,
so I had to bail.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.409
- Oh, where was it?

08:13.492 --> 08:14.702
- The Oaks.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.079
- I'm in the Oaks.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.539
- Oh, yeah?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.665
Wow.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.126
- What street?

08:27.089 --> 08:28.633
- Oh, shoot. You know what?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.343
There are so many streets
up there, right?

08:30.426 --> 08:31.761
So many Oaks, so crissy-crossy.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.888
- Are you Essex Trust?

08:33.971 --> 08:35.723
- Nope. How's your salad?
Mine is good.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.558
Mine is really good.
- Oh, my God.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.644
You're the fucking mold guy

08:39.727 --> 08:41.062
who pulled out
at the eleventh hour.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.647
- Hold on,
let me just explain.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.440
- I had to disclose
that fucking inspection

08:44.524 --> 08:46.651
to every buyer.
You made my house toxic!

08:46.734 --> 08:49.195
- Well, technically it was
because of the black mold.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.822
- I lost $1/2 million
on that house

08:51.906 --> 08:53.741
because of you
being a little mold bitch!

08:53.824 --> 08:55.117
- Well, if I want
to have a family,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.202
it wouldn't be safe
for the baby.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.620
Think about the baby.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.080
Think about it
from the baby's perspective.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.082
- You're not even married,
you freak!

09:01.165 --> 09:03.042
- I could do it on my own.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.210
- You know what?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.046
I'm going to make sure
that they use

09:07.129 --> 09:08.923
every single detail
from that email.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.925
- No, please, no, Janet--
- Actually, why wait?

09:11.008 --> 09:15.012
I'm sure the TMZ would love
to get their hands on it today.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.430
- Okay, look, I apologize.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.974
- Oh, excuse me.
- I didn't know it was you.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.892
- I gotta get back
to the office.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.644
I got some calls to make.
- No, no, no, no.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.771
You don't need to make
any calls.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.064
Janet, I'll buy it.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.691
I'll buy it.
I'll buy it for 500 over.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.734
Whatever you--
whatever the contract is now,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.403
I'll be the backup offer.
Please, Janet.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.696
I'm so sorry. Janet?

09:34.865 --> 09:35.866
- Move!

09:37.994 --> 09:39.203
- Bad. Bad.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.296
- Want to get a coffee?

09:48.379 --> 09:49.755
Try to fix
that free range chicken joke?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.257
I mean, it did okay
last night, but--

09:51.340 --> 09:53.092
- No, no, we're going
to see my psychic.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.136
That's the whole reason
we're in Sedona.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.722
- Wait, the one
who stole from you?

09:57.805 --> 10:01.809
- Oh, Zephyr? No.
God no, that son of a bitch.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.894
Joke's on him, though.
He drowned.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.980
- How is that a joke?

10:06.063 --> 10:08.065
- I'm laughing.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.363
- Oh, my God.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.158
I cannot believe
you walked in here today.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.327
Look at this.
Look at this.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.037
Look.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.998
I just sold
my Cisco stock today,

10:24.081 --> 10:25.166
and now you're here?

10:25.249 --> 10:27.251
Is that wild, or is that wild?

10:27.335 --> 10:29.754
By the way, my return?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.630
258%.
- Yes.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.341
- Thank God
you told me to buy it.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.884
- I'm psychic.
- Me too.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.262
- So what do you think
of crypto?

10:38.346 --> 10:41.223
- No, I like to stay
fad-free in my portfolio.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.391
Are you into renewables?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.684
- Renewables.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.019
Look, I gotta write
this shit down.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.229
Here. Come on, come on.
Come in.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.607
Uh, don't trip
over the extension cords.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.859
- Is this insider trading?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.110
- No.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.820
But you've seen me
do that before.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.201
- Not great, Jimmy Jr.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.535
Not great.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.828
- I know.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.538
I tried to handle it myself,
obviously,

11:04.622 --> 11:06.207
and I hate to bother you
with this.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.834
It's just...I don't know.
I don't know what else to do.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.379
- You know,
Janet has been all over me

11:11.462 --> 11:14.590
to attach one of my directors
to her client's movie.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.050
- Oh, yeah?

11:16.133 --> 11:17.593
- If he does,
it's a guaranteed green light.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.136
- Do you think
you could use that?

11:19.220 --> 11:20.596
- Come on.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.308
This entire business
is built on quid pro quo.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.937
If Janet wants my client--
believe me, she does--

11:28.020 --> 11:31.065
then she will have to make
this email just...

11:31.148 --> 11:32.942
Disappear.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.194
- Oh, Michael,
that would be incredible.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.695
- It would.

11:36.779 --> 11:41.700
You know what else
is quid pro quo, Jimmy?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.494
Hmm?
- Mm...

11:46.539 --> 11:48.416
- Marriage.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.542
- Sure.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.753
- My wife, oy,
she's a worrier.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.089
And she's worried sick
about Kayla.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.091
Now, see, our little girl
hasn't been the same

11:57.174 --> 11:59.635
since she was moved
off your desk.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.804
And my wife loves her daughter.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.431
She has been
nothing but an angel

12:03.514 --> 12:04.765
since the day she was born.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.809
- Really sweet...
- Mm-hmm.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.269
- Cool, cool person.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.770
- See, here's the issue.

12:09.854 --> 12:13.357
My wife and I have
a trip planned to Mallorca.

12:13.441 --> 12:14.358
- Oh.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.734
- But worrying about Kayla

12:15.818 --> 12:18.279
is affecting my wife's mood.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.864
And the timing of that is bad

12:19.947 --> 12:23.492
'cause, Jimmy, I want
a blow job in Mallorca.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.952
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:25.035 --> 12:28.581
- That sounds like
a great setting for that.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.124
- Yeah.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.417
But...

12:31.500 --> 12:35.296
that's not happening
if Kayla's upset.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.966
So I help you
make an email disappear.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.011
You help me
get my balls drained.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.013
Well, ball.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.931
You know, I'm a survivor.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.349
- Mm-hmm.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.684
- What do you say, Jimmy?

12:51.562 --> 12:53.772
Jimmy LuSaque Jr.'s office.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.900
I'm back.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.613
Oh, well, you know how he is.
He's sensitive.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.199
I love him, though.
All right.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.160
All right, girlfriend,
I'll send you through.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.829
Jimmy, your mom's on.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.955
Jimmy!

13:14.418 --> 13:15.669
- Hey, Mom.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.798
Um...

13:19.882 --> 13:21.175
I'm having a bad day.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.557
- No, Mom, no, I don't
really want to talk about it.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.018
How are you?

13:31.101 --> 13:32.895
- Fascinating.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.649
Ah, Death card.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.608
- My God.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.026
- Oh, it could mean death,

13:39.109 --> 13:41.820
but it doesn't
literally just mean death.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.656
It could mean rebirth.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.491
A transformation
for the better.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.244
- That makes sense--I mean,
the show's totally new to me.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.454
- Whoomp, there it is.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.668
Ah, the Ace of Pentacles.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.128
Financial prosperity, baby.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.715
- I see...

14:01.799 --> 14:04.176
a new success on the QVC.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.719
- Mm, I doubt it.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.221
I mean, I'm kind of
pulling back from that.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.682
I'm not launching
anything new this year.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.767
- I'm just telling you
what I see.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.024
The Tower.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.739
- What, this one is worse
than the Death card?

14:25.823 --> 14:27.825
- It's a cosmic wrecking ball.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.746
Deborah...

14:32.830 --> 14:35.916
a truth is about to be
revealed to you.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.835
And it is disastrous.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.920
- Well, you could be
wrong, though, right?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.046
'Cause, you know,
you were wrong

14:41.130 --> 14:42.840
about the QVC thing, so...

14:42.923 --> 14:44.300
- Cards don't lie.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.551
- Seems like,
how could you know, though?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.927
Did you shuffle good?

14:47.011 --> 14:48.137
- Would you stop it?

14:48.220 --> 14:49.805
It's fine. It's better to know.

14:49.888 --> 14:52.099
This way, I can,
you know, be on the lookout.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.269
Okay, red.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.104
You ready for a reading?

14:57.187 --> 14:58.897
- Me? No. Me? No.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.108
Me? No. No, I'm good.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.943
I'm a science girl,
so I'm cool.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.778
- Come on,
at least let me snap

15:04.862 --> 15:06.614
a pic of your aura real quick.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.782
On the house?
- Thank you. Not interested.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.660
- Oh, come on.
Have a little fun, would ya?

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
- All right.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.085
Ah. Don't worry.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.546
Here we go.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.803
Gotcha.

15:31.221 --> 15:34.767
Now I do, do-do,
do-do, do-do this

15:34.850 --> 15:39.146
and I do this
and we put this in here.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.069
Wow.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.487
Pure blue.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.949
Means you're honest and have
clarity in communication.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.285
- That's true.
This girl's honest to a fault.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.995
She's always trying
to get me to be more honest,

15:55.079 --> 15:57.081
which, honestly, is exhausting.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.874
This morning, she told me
that she was a four

15:58.957 --> 16:00.834
on the Bristol Stool Chart.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.002
And trust me, I didn't ask.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.338
- Ugh, I'd kill to be a four.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.631
I have trouble.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.925
Enjoy it while you're young.
- Mm.

16:08.008 --> 16:11.220
- Here you go,
Little Miss Honesty.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.305
- Let me see.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.807
Wow.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.392
- It's a good aura.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.520
So if you're in renewables...
- Mm-hmm?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.271
- Does that mean
you're out on oil?

16:21.355 --> 16:23.482
- Oh, God no.
I'm always in oil.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.406
Mm, these are pretty.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.409
Good stocking stuffers.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.870
Oh.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.749
It says,
"Give to a loving friend".

16:42.292 --> 16:44.461
Gonna get me one?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.595
Um, Deborah,
I have to tell you something.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.055
- Oh, please,
if it's more about

16:55.139 --> 16:56.849
the Bristol Stool Chart,
I've heard enough.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.475
- What I'm about to say
might upset you,

16:58.559 --> 17:00.519
but I think it's better
for our relationship

17:00.602 --> 17:01.729
if I tell you.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.939
Okay, what is?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.901
- After our fight,

17:07.985 --> 17:10.279
I got drunk and took Xanax

17:10.362 --> 17:11.905
and I sent a very stupid email

17:11.989 --> 17:14.450
to those showrunners
that I met with in LA.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.369
I said some...

17:17.453 --> 17:18.954
unkind things about you

17:19.038 --> 17:23.751
that I don't even believe
because I was hurt and angry,

17:23.834 --> 17:25.252
and I'm sorry.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.088
- You did what?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.383
- I said some pretty
revealing stuff about you

17:31.467 --> 17:33.010
that you probably
wouldn't want made public,

17:33.093 --> 17:34.428
and I'm trying
to get them to not use it

17:34.511 --> 17:35.971
in their show,
but I think that they are

17:36.054 --> 17:37.139
because they--

17:37.222 --> 17:38.390
they told me they are.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.476
But it might not
even go to series.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.191
- Who's starring in it?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.321
- Um...

17:52.404 --> 17:54.323
Helen Mirren.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.160
- Of course
it's going to series!

17:58.243 --> 18:01.205
You ungrateful bitch!

18:01.288 --> 18:03.791
Oh!
- Deborah, I'm so sorry!

18:03.874 --> 18:05.292
- Oh, too late!

18:06.835 --> 18:09.630
- Hey, calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

18:10.881 --> 18:12.299
- You said
you wouldn't hit people!

18:12.382 --> 18:14.176
- I won't
if you move fast enough!

18:14.259 --> 18:16.804
- Not the tourmaline!
- I'll buy what I break!

18:16.887 --> 18:17.805
- You--

18:34.279 --> 18:35.155
Hey.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.323
- Finally.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.450
So I am officially

18:38.534 --> 18:40.786
the manager of the century.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.914
I took one for the team,
and the email's taken care of.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.457
She's never gonna find out.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.253
- I just told her.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.588
- I'm sorry.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.549
It sounded like you said
you just told her.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.051
- I did.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.016
- Oh, my God, Ava.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.726
Why? Why?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.436
- I know,
but even if I had known,

19:06.520 --> 19:08.063
I had to be honest.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.857
I hope you didn't go
through too much trouble.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.693
- Jimmy! Can I go?
I gotta go buy towels.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.611
'Cause I need a new set.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.863
- I definitely did.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.531
- And I know
she's gonna fire me,

19:17.614 --> 19:19.032
and you'll have
to drop me and--

19:20.993 --> 19:22.911
I'm really sorry,

19:22.995 --> 19:25.956
for this and everything
I put you through.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.457
- Oh, God.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.167
Well, listen, you know,
I just gotta say--

19:29.251 --> 19:31.545
- Um, Jimmy,
I gotta call you back.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.133
- Hungry?

19:46.143 --> 19:48.145
- I have good news, actually.

19:48.228 --> 19:51.899
That, uh, email,
it's not gonna be used

19:51.982 --> 19:52.941
in their new show.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.360
Jimmy took care of it.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.362
- Can I get you gals
anything else?

19:57.446 --> 19:58.572
- Just the bill, please.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.573
Separate checks.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.741
- Sure.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.376
Okay.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.590
Read it to me.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.550
- Oh, no, no. Please don't--

20:18.634 --> 20:21.303
- I'm telling you
to read it to me.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.650
The entire thing.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.070
- "Hey, y'all.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.447
"Parentheses, trying not to use

20:40.530 --> 20:43.116
"the gendered term
'you guys' anymore

20:43.200 --> 20:46.119
"even though it honestly
sounds neutral to me,

20:46.203 --> 20:47.704
"end parentheses.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.832
"First of all, I'm so sorry

20:50.916 --> 20:52.542
"about how our meeting ended
the other day.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.379
"I fucking suck
at first impressions.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.130
"LOL.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.594
"I just wanted
to follow up on our convo.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.806
"I actually think Deborah Vance
is the perfect comp

21:05.889 --> 21:09.726
for your horrible boss
character in 'Bitch PM.'"

21:09.810 --> 21:12.896
Their show is about
a prime minister.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.773
Who is a bitch.

21:14.856 --> 21:15.941
- Yeah, got that.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.821
- "Anyway,
here are some stories

21:20.904 --> 21:22.990
"you could probably use
about someone

21:23.073 --> 21:25.325
"who treats people like shit

21:25.409 --> 21:27.536
"and has no remorse
about it at all.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.666
"She once asked me
to perjure myself

21:32.749 --> 21:34.334
"for her in traffic court.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.044
"Most days, the first words
out of her mouth

21:36.128 --> 21:38.797
"when she sees me are,
'Not flattering.'

21:38.880 --> 21:40.716
"Once when I was having
an asthma attack,

21:40.799 --> 21:44.344
"she said, 'Do you have
to do that in here?'

21:44.428 --> 21:47.681
"She once refused
an employee maternity leave

21:47.764 --> 21:50.517
"because she thought
the baby was ugly and said,

21:50.600 --> 21:53.770
"'Why would she want
to be at home with that thing?'

21:58.608 --> 22:00.527
"She has
a terrible relationship

22:00.610 --> 22:02.070
"with her junkie daughter

22:02.154 --> 22:04.781
"who sells photos of Deborah
to the tabloids

22:04.865 --> 22:07.117
"looking like shit
because they sell better

22:07.200 --> 22:09.369
"if she looks like she's dying.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.912
"What's even sicker

22:10.996 --> 22:13.874
"is that Deborah knows about it
and lets it happen.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.876
"Their relationship
could be repaired

22:15.959 --> 22:19.504
"if Deborah would just tell her
she's proud of her,

22:19.588 --> 22:21.381
"but she won't even do that.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.051
"Even though
she's clearly the reason

22:24.134 --> 22:26.720
she's so fucked up
in the first place."

22:26.803 --> 22:28.805
Please don't make me
keep reading this.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.108
"The truth is,
Deborah Vance is a bully.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.444
"And the worst kind.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.155
"One who thinks
she's the victim.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.491
"Every person in her life
is on her payroll

22:47.574 --> 22:48.950
"and would never be around her

22:49.034 --> 22:51.328
"if their livelihoods
didn't depend on it.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.207
"Myself included.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.669
"It's her own fault
she's so lonely.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.591
"Though she's too selfish
to ever admit it,

23:04.674 --> 23:07.636
"I think that's why
she needs her adoring fans.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.101
Because no one in her life
actually loves her."

23:14.184 --> 23:15.769
Deborah, that's not true.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.854
I don't believe--
- Thanks, ladies.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.231
Have a great night.

23:28.990 --> 23:31.159
- You can pay for mine.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.192
- You know,
you're good at writing for me.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.571
And I thought it was because
you understood me.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.078
But it's because
you're just like me.

24:17.664 --> 24:21.084
You're as selfish and cruel
as I am.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.031
- Hey, Barbara.

24:51.114 --> 24:54.451
So I have some horrific news.

24:54.534 --> 24:56.536
Kayla is back on my desk.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.788
I really appreciate the idea,
but we can just drop

24:58.872 --> 25:00.540
that whole
anger management thing.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.167
- Oof, I can't do that.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.793
It's already in your file,

25:03.877 --> 25:07.631
and once it's in your file,
it's in your file.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.174
- You can't take it
out of the file?

25:09.257 --> 25:11.426
- Physically, I can't
take it out of your file,

25:11.509 --> 25:14.888
and if I tried to,
then that would go in my file.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.266
- Okay, but I don't have
anger issues.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.144
- It's only a 52-week course.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.439
- 52 weeks?

25:24.522 --> 25:26.274
That's a whole year, Barbara.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.193
- It's actually
a little bit longer,

25:28.276 --> 25:30.570
because they don't meet
the weeks of Christmas

25:30.654 --> 25:32.322
and Hanukkah and Halloween.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.491
- They don't meet
the week of Halloween?

25:34.574 --> 25:36.952
- Yeah, Joyce,
the woman who runs it,

25:37.035 --> 25:40.038
is really into Halloween,
and she throws a great party

25:40.121 --> 25:42.874
every year, but you have
to come in costume.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.461
- Hold on, are you friends
with this person?

25:46.544 --> 25:49.005
- Not anymore,
because I came one year

25:49.089 --> 25:52.259
not in costume
and she got really mad at me.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.471
- So the anger management
course woman got mad?

25:56.554 --> 25:59.891
- Well, you know, it's like,
those who can't do, teach.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.562
- This sounds like a 52-week
fucking scam, Barbara.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.481
- Okay, calm down.

26:06.564 --> 26:07.774
You know, I actually think

26:07.857 --> 26:09.943
this course might be
good for you.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.238
Wow.

26:14.990 --> 26:18.702
- If I were you, I would go
to that Halloween party though.

26:18.785 --> 26:19.953
She goes all out.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.788
Just make sure
you go in costume,

26:21.871 --> 26:24.708
and take it from me,
cat ears don't count.

26:52.110 --> 26:56.281
- Hi, can I get a cab
to the Safari Inn?

27:03.413 --> 27:04.873
- Well, are you gonna
get in the car,

27:04.956 --> 27:07.876
or are you just gonna
stand there staring?

27:07.959 --> 27:09.419
- Uh, cancel that, actually.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.171
Sorry.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.641
- Oh, I got you a coffee.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.311
- Uh, thanks.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.357
- It's not poisoned.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.527
Look...

27:34.611 --> 27:37.364
I slept on it,
and I'm just gonna move on.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.032
Let it go.

27:39.115 --> 27:40.700
- Really?
- Yes.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.910
I mean, you're a good writer,

27:41.993 --> 27:43.328
and I need you on this tour.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.829
If I held a grudge
against every person

27:44.913 --> 27:47.332
who ever wronged me,
I'd have gray hair.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.045
Thank you so much.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.102
And again, I'm so sorry.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.561
I'm gonna be better.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.855
I'm gonna stop doing shit
that makes me impulsive,

28:10.939 --> 28:12.565
like drinking and taking pills,

28:12.649 --> 28:14.234
and I'm gonna get a dumb phone

28:14.317 --> 28:17.404
so I can't even use
social media or email anyone.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.573
And I'm gonna get one
of those giant water bottles

28:20.657 --> 28:22.534
and only consume water.

28:22.617 --> 28:24.828
I promise I'm gonna
be better, Deborah.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.996
- Whatever you need to do.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.915
- Okay, great.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.085
Thank you.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.631
- Oh, I think
you should take it.

28:36.714 --> 28:37.882
- Oh, okay.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.219
Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey there.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.804
So I regret to inform you

28:42.887 --> 28:46.141
that Deborah is suing you
for violating your NDA.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.893
- Wait, what?
You're suing me?

28:48.977 --> 28:52.188
- Oh, I can't discuss
details of the case.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.189
- Is this real?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.357
- Yes.
- Yes.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.692
Thick document.

28:55.775 --> 28:56.776
Real big.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.319
- What?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.697
- Haven't you ever
been in litigation before?

29:00.780 --> 29:03.616
It'll be a good
learning experience for you.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.826
Expensive one too.
