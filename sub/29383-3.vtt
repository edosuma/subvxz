WEBVTT

00:08.791 --> 00:12.403
RAMIREZ:
Let me in!
I'm going to kill you, bitch!

00:14.144 --> 00:16.059
I'm coming for you!

00:16.103 --> 00:17.060
Come on!

00:18.366 --> 00:19.236
Help him.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.108
RAMIREZ:
Crush that pretty face...

00:30.160 --> 00:31.857
RAY:
Seriously, none of us

00:31.901 --> 00:34.034
could break down that door
if we had all day.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.128
Listen.

00:41.171 --> 00:44.696
It stopped.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.134
Maybe he left.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.279
Help me with this!

01:12.768 --> 01:16.293
That's not Mr. Jingles.
Who the fuck is that psycho?

01:16.337 --> 01:18.774
I've been telling you. That'sthe guy who's trying to kill me.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.558
I got to get my keys.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.047
BROOKE:
Where is he? Do you hear him?

01:35.051 --> 01:36.748
I found them.
We just got to get to the car.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.794
Whoa! We can't go outside.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.187
And he's-- sooner or later,

01:40.230 --> 01:41.579
he's coming in here,
he's gonna kill us.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.754
There are four of us
and one of him.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.278
We can protect each other.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.932
That's right.
There are four of us.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.499
And if we split up
and make a run for it,

01:48.543 --> 01:50.240
the best he can do
is just get one.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.633
Wow.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.157
It's Darwin, man.
Survival of the fittest.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.203
-It's our only chance.-You're really just gonna commit

01:56.246 --> 01:57.639
to this whole coward thing,
aren't you?

01:57.682 --> 01:59.423
We are not
leaving anybody behind.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.773
I'm not gonna die here, okay?

02:01.817 --> 02:03.514
And...

02:03.558 --> 02:06.300
and I know I can run faster
than at least two of you.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.563
So let's just say the three
people lucky enough to make it

02:08.606 --> 02:10.086
meet up at the parking lot.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.310
Like he said,
three lucky people. Come on.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.140
Shit...

02:32.674 --> 02:35.372
-Shit.
-Move it, Darwin.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.334
TREVOR:
You got to get up, man.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.248
We can't give up
without a fight.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.597
That's karma coming
through that door.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.860
There's nothing
we can do to stop it.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.644
I could really use
one of those ludes right now.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.502
Is he still there?

03:19.764 --> 03:22.376
I don't see anything.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.120
Oh, God! Oh!

03:28.164 --> 03:30.514
Oh, God! Ah! Oh!

03:32.951 --> 03:34.910
Shit.

03:34.953 --> 03:36.433
It's a bag of shit!

03:38.174 --> 03:39.262
PETE:
Nice throw, bro.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.309
LARRY:
Dude, that shit was awesome.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.527
See how it lit on fire?

03:44.963 --> 03:46.530
Jingle, jingle.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.489
He got shit all over his shoes.

03:48.532 --> 03:51.318
Happy Jingles Day, douchewads.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.712
I've been collecting my shit
for three weeks.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.453
Totally worth it.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.716
Who the hell are you?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.284
We're Mr. Jingles. Duh.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.286
You've been collecting
your own shit?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.375
Get any weird phone calls
lately?

04:05.419 --> 04:07.377
-What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:07.421 --> 04:08.465
It's a tradition, man.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.554
On the anniversary
of the massacre.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.774
Kids pull pranks
in stores and restaurants

04:12.817 --> 04:14.210
and screw with people.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.559
Fucking townie assholes.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.082
Oh...

04:22.523 --> 04:23.785
Hey.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.308
Way too late, wide load.

04:25.352 --> 04:28.529
You totally missed it.
They were so frickin' scared.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.753
Pete, what the fuck, man?

04:37.146 --> 04:38.669
XAVIER:
He's not one of them.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.323
That's the real Jingles.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.548
Go. Go now.

04:47.591 --> 04:48.418
Get to the parking lot. Go.

04:49.506 --> 04:50.681
LARRY:
Dude.

04:50.725 --> 04:53.380
What's your damage, man?
No...

06:32.174 --> 06:33.480
-CHET: We made it!
-RAY: Don't say anything
till we're back in L.A.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.438
Not that it matters,
but Nurse Rita's

06:35.482 --> 06:36.657
-totally faster than you.
-No way.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.358
-Chet! Chet!
-He knows where to meet us.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.012
Come on.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.196
Fuck...

07:13.607 --> 07:15.522
Jesus, Larry.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.567
A little privacy.

07:17.611 --> 07:21.049
I can't piss rightwhen I know you're watching me.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.052
Ow, ow. Now I'm all backed up.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.490
You know I've got
that twisted urethra thing.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.758
Ooh.

07:34.802 --> 07:39.067
I can't see shit
without my glasses.

07:39.110 --> 07:42.549
Look, I know you guys
didn't have to take me.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.942
I know my mom paid you.

07:44.986 --> 07:49.381
But when I'm wearing this mask,
I am Jingles,

07:49.425 --> 07:53.342
the most ruthless killer
of all time.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.953
Just let me be a badass
for one night. Come on.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.521
Oh, sh...

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
Let's motor.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.646
CHET:
Get me off this thing, man.

08:44.175 --> 08:47.657
-Oh, God! Damn it.
-That's not good.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.401
Look, Chet, you probably don't
want to hear this,

08:52.444 --> 08:54.577
but your shoulder is being
plugged up by that thing.

08:54.621 --> 08:55.578
If we pull you off,
you'll probably bleed out.

08:55.622 --> 08:58.276
L-Like, to death?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.930
Is that your official
medical opinion?

08:59.974 --> 09:02.803
It's not gonna matter if we
don't find a way out of here.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.587
The whole point
is to keep us in.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.024
It's a punji pit.
Haven't you seen First Blood?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.200
-What?
-Yeah, the Viet Cong,

09:09.244 --> 09:10.637
they used to dig these pits
with spikes in them

09:10.680 --> 09:13.683
and put them on the side
of trails to catch G.I.s.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.293
Jingles was a vet.
He probably dug this up

09:15.337 --> 09:17.469
-like the ones he saw in 'Nam.
-Are you sure

09:17.513 --> 09:19.515
it was Jingles and not the otherguy trying to kill us?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.736
Jesus Christ. What the hell
kind of camp is this?

09:28.437 --> 09:29.481
BROOKE:
Where is everyone?

09:29.525 --> 09:31.440
They should be here by now.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.963
I'm sure they're coming.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.662
The boys' cabin
is just further away.

09:35.705 --> 09:38.665
No.
It's been too long.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.668
Hey, maybe we should
just go and get help.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.105
And leave everyone here
to fend for themselves?

09:44.148 --> 09:46.150
Your friends wouldn't
bail on you like that.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.676
I'm not bailing.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.286
The highway's not far.

09:51.329 --> 09:54.332
Maybe we could get the police
to come down here.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.423
You're right. Go.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.729
I'll wait.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.513
I'll tell the others
you went for help.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.558
Thank you.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.912
I'll be back as soon...

10:15.702 --> 10:18.139
Oh, honey. I wish you could
see your face right now.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.665
You're confused, aren't you?

10:27.539 --> 10:28.671
Don't worry.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.717
Nurse Rita's gonna
make it all better.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.683
Well, Ms. Chambers, you've
certainly put in the work.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.903
Dartmouth, Penn.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.296
I have to say you look
remarkably well-rested

10:45.340 --> 10:47.821
for someone in the throes
of doctoral research.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.084
But I'm sorry to tell you

10:50.127 --> 10:52.608
that you've wasted your time
coming here.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.959
Benjamin Richter
is a lost cause.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.569
I doubt that.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.576
He hasn't said a word in years.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.753
I've tried every angle
to get him to talk,

11:06.796 --> 11:09.756
but he just stares back at you

11:09.799 --> 11:11.845
with those black shark eyes.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.543
Now, I know, in our profession,

11:14.586 --> 11:17.546
we like to think there's alwaysmethod behind madness--

11:17.589 --> 11:20.723
a linear path
from innocence, wounding,

11:20.767 --> 11:23.552
to violence and sociopathy.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.772
But all I've been shown
by Benjamin Richter

11:25.815 --> 11:27.861
is that some people
are just evil.

11:27.904 --> 11:29.950
My research has shown otherwise.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.387
I recently spoke to Ted Bundy
down in Florida

11:32.430 --> 11:35.956
and pried confessions to two
unsolved murders from him.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.175
I wasn't aware of that.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.308
The feds wanted to keep it
on the down-low.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.962
But I've talked to them all.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.399
Gacy, William Bonin,
aka the Freeway Killer,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.575
Patrick Kearney,
aka the Trash Bag Killer,

11:46.618 --> 11:49.317
Robert Hansen,
aka the Butcher Baker--

11:49.360 --> 11:50.797
all their lips are sealed.

11:50.840 --> 11:54.452
Until Donna Chambers arrives
and opens them.

11:54.496 --> 11:58.021
This case has been your life
for over a decade.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.588
Do you really want
to go to your grave

11:59.631 --> 12:01.024
not knowing
what makes that man tick?

12:01.068 --> 12:03.897
Worst case,
he clams up for me, too.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.855
And I leave like a fool.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.989
Be smart.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.342
Now, if you're gonna be alone
with him, he stays restrained.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.823
This guy can regressto violent behavior at any time.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.042
The reawakening of Mr. Jingles.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.874
I just mean... to get a window
into that side of him

12:24.918 --> 12:26.397
would be valuable.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.661
Academically.And I appreciate the restraints.

12:29.705 --> 12:30.880
Safety first.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.153
Mr. Richter.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.589
This is Donna Chambers.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.287
She's doing research
for a PhD.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.854
She'd like to talk to you.

12:49.899 --> 12:52.684
You're not gonna get anything
out of this guy.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.425
We'll be fine.

12:54.469 --> 12:55.775
Won't we, Benjamin?

12:59.213 --> 13:01.171
And I'm going to need a record

13:01.215 --> 13:03.913
of everything you discussed.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.135
-Regulations.
-Of course.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.010
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.714
I spoke to Dr. Hopple.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.677
She thinks that you're evil.

13:29.983 --> 13:32.115
That you were born to kill.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.682
Do you believe that?

13:36.163 --> 13:37.381
'Cause I don't.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.255
I don't believe in evil.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.561
I believe that while the abilityto do violence

13:43.605 --> 13:45.259
exists in all people,

13:45.302 --> 13:48.958
the need to hurt--
to murder over and over--

13:49.002 --> 13:52.527
needs to be activated
by outside circumstances.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.014
You were drafted
into the Army,

14:01.057 --> 14:03.364
trained to think nothing
of human life.

14:03.407 --> 14:07.063
Sent to the jungle to kill
in the name of patriotism.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.544
I know you don't
like to talk, but...

14:09.587 --> 14:11.589
answer me one question.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.678
Did you ever

14:13.722 --> 14:15.985
hurt anyone before that?

14:16.029 --> 14:17.552
Did you ever kill anything?

14:19.162 --> 14:21.469
I've been studying
serial killers

14:21.512 --> 14:23.079
for the past five years.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.821
Since the mid-1970s
there's been an uptick

14:25.865 --> 14:27.823
in spree or serial killings.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.346
Why?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.609
Were there suddenly
more evil men born?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.481
Or...

14:33.524 --> 14:36.353
did the increased availability
of pornography

14:36.397 --> 14:39.356
and the psychic echo
of the war in Southeast Asia

14:39.400 --> 14:42.664
damage the minds
of otherwise good men?

14:45.319 --> 14:47.321
High fructose corn syrup.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.977
It's in everything nowadays.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.631
They say it's bad for you.
Maybe...

14:53.675 --> 14:56.808
uh, that has something
to do with it, too.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.027
So you can talk.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.598
I've been here, locked up,

15:03.641 --> 15:05.426
for 14 years.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.125
When I told them I...

15:09.169 --> 15:12.955
couldn't remember
killing those kids,

15:12.999 --> 15:16.350
they told me that
I'd had a psychotic break,

15:16.393 --> 15:19.440
that I was evil...

15:19.483 --> 15:21.877
and that I was the worst kind
of human being.

15:23.661 --> 15:26.186
Irredeemable.

15:26.229 --> 15:29.232
What if I told you
I don't think that's true.

15:29.276 --> 15:32.409
What if I told you that
something twisted your brain

15:32.453 --> 15:34.542
and gave you no choice?

15:34.585 --> 15:37.545
So what you're saying is

15:37.588 --> 15:40.461
maybe it isn't all my fault?

15:42.158 --> 15:44.769
I'd like to help out.
Can I help you?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.597
Well, you can't do it
from in here.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.035
We got to get you out.

15:49.078 --> 15:52.952
I need to study you
in your natural habitat.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.479
They're re-opening the camp.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.056
Even sitting here,

16:10.099 --> 16:11.448
looking at that face,

16:11.492 --> 16:12.493
I want to stab her

16:12.536 --> 16:14.930
over and over.

16:16.932 --> 16:19.195
I can't go back there.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.805
I know I would kill again.

16:20.849 --> 16:24.331
Sometimes sacrifices need to bemade in the name of science.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.161
Feel my hands.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.308
So soft.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.181
That's my cold cream.

16:48.224 --> 16:52.315
How many bunnies had to die
to get the formula right?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.187
If I could crack the code

16:54.230 --> 16:55.927
of what makes you do
what you do,

16:55.971 --> 16:58.626
maybe we can begin mandatory
classes in grade school.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.498
What if you could have the honor

17:01.542 --> 17:03.370
of being the world's
last serial killer?

17:07.243 --> 17:09.550
Redemption.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.595
It's time to stop the violence.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.340
But why?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.562
Did someone hurt you?

17:23.346 --> 17:25.000
I have my reasons.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.135
But, most importantly...

17:30.484 --> 17:33.617
...I believe that no one
is born evil, Benjamin.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.535
No one is irredeemable.

17:38.579 --> 17:42.539
I feel like I'm being seenfor the first time in 14 years.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.369
Tell me what I have to do.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.763
All you have to do
is be yourself.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.286
Don't hold back.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.376
Trust your instincts.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.335
But first we got to
get you out of here.

17:55.378 --> 17:56.945
And in order to do that,

17:56.988 --> 17:58.773
you need to do three things:

17:58.816 --> 18:00.731
take care of that pesky guard,

18:01.863 --> 18:02.820
hit the switch...

18:05.736 --> 18:07.347
...find the bag.

18:12.613 --> 18:14.093
When you meet me
back at the camp...

18:16.617 --> 18:18.575
...I'll have a new job

18:18.619 --> 18:20.621
and a new name.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.677
If you ask me,
all those murders

20:00.721 --> 20:03.941
are because of the availabilityof pornography

20:03.985 --> 20:06.205
and the objectification
of women in our culture.

I mean, the way I saw it,
I couldn't change

25:26.699 --> 25:27.743
the fact that Chan was dead,

25:27.787 --> 25:30.398
but I could keep us
all out of trouble.

25:30.441 --> 25:31.834
And myself out of jail.

25:31.878 --> 25:36.752

was an accident, right?

26:30.806 --> 26:34.723
The look in his eyes
as he went over the cliff.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.203
I couldn't go to the house.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.509
I couldn't go to classes.

26:39.554 --> 26:42.470
Eventually, I just dropped out.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.559
Which is how I ended up with

26:44.603 --> 26:46.953
this shit job at the hospital.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.870
People thought he, uh,

26:50.913 --> 26:54.221
went missing.

26:54.264 --> 26:56.745
I thought I'd gotten
away with it.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.444
And then, three days ago,
the Timesreported

27:00.488 --> 27:02.751
that Chan's car had been found.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.755
Which means that it's...

27:08.409 --> 27:11.673
...it's only a matter of time
before they find my watch.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.501
That's why I'm here.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.590
I'm running.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.815

to finally tell someone.

27:22.858 --> 27:25.078
I mean, I know
you can't hear me.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.602
I can hear you.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.693
That's some messed-up shit.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.695
I mean, it wasn't on purpose.

27:33.739 --> 27:35.784
I said I thought
he was already dead.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.831
From the first time
you killed him.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.876
I-I said he fell!

27:55.021 --> 27:56.109
Dude, what are you doing?

27:56.152 --> 27:57.850

28:00.635 --> 28:03.420
-Don't leave me down here.
- Come on!

28:03.464 --> 28:04.944
Please.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.989

28:41.067 --> 28:42.677

28:42.721 --> 28:45.332

28:45.375 --> 28:47.421

28:47.464 --> 28:48.639

from dying,

28:48.683 --> 28:50.032
then maybe I can
make this right.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.991

What happened?

31:45.120 --> 31:46.556
W-Where's everyone else?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.210
We were attacked
at the infirmary.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.951
Everyone scattered.
I got stabbed.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.214
Chet was with me,
but I lost him.

31:52.258 --> 31:53.999
Had to cover myself
with dirt and leaves to hide.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.957
What about Brooke?

31:56.001 --> 31:57.393
Last time I saw her,
she was with Rita.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.961
Oh, no.

32:00.005 --> 32:03.356
-What?
-Rita is not Rita.

32:03.399 --> 32:06.054
We found the real one bound
and gagged in the boathouse.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.360
She was wearing
a nurse's uniform.

32:07.403 --> 32:09.014
Jingles killed her.

32:09.057 --> 32:12.017
Wait... wait, what?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.540
-Then who the hell
is with Brooke?
-I don't know,

32:13.583 --> 32:15.107
-but we got to find her.
-The plan was

32:15.150 --> 32:17.152
to go to the parking lot.
That's where we should go.

32:17.196 --> 32:18.588
I am not leaving here

32:18.632 --> 32:20.416
-without Margaret and Bertie.
-Me neither.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.549
If y'all want to be heroes,
that's fine by me,

32:22.592 --> 32:25.030
but there is no way in hell
that I'm going back.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.597
Not with two murderers lurking
in the goddamn shadows.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.382
Fine, fine.

32:29.425 --> 32:30.992
You ever ride a bike before?

32:31.036 --> 32:32.341
Once or twice.

32:32.385 --> 32:35.388
Okay. There's a call box
down the road.

32:35.431 --> 32:39.087
Take my Ninja, call the cops,
and meet us back at the lot.

32:41.524 --> 32:44.266
Montana, you go with him.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.441
Hey, hey.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.575
The bike is a fickle mistress.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.142
Go easy on the throttle
or she'll buck you

32:50.185 --> 32:51.621
like a wild stallion.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.311
Hello?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.271
-Is someone up there?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.188
Just leave me alone.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.407
-Chet?
-Xavier?

33:38.451 --> 33:39.495
Oh, thank God.

33:39.539 --> 33:41.671
What the hell are you doing
down there, man?

33:41.715 --> 33:44.326
I'm dying! What does it
look like I'm doing?

33:44.370 --> 33:47.286
There's a stake through my
shoulder, I can't move.

33:47.329 --> 33:48.678
You got to get me out of here.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.465
All right.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.510
I'm coming down.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.003
I thought I was done.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.309
I thought that was it.

34:12.528 --> 34:16.358
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.932
Damn, that looks gnarly.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.499
It was him.
It was Jingles.

34:26.542 --> 34:29.589
Ray-- he-he fell in here,
too, but...

34:30.329 --> 34:31.504
...he left me.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.462
Ray told us you got separated.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.290
He's got issues, man.

34:35.334 --> 34:38.119
He's got serious fucking issues.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.385
-I, uh, I feel like

34:43.429 --> 34:45.561
we're gonna need a real doctor
down here to get you off this.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.347
TREVOR:
Shh, shh, shh.

34:48.390 --> 34:50.044
Someone's coming.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.352
-Hurry up, hurry up.
-It's him. It's Jingles.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.005
Y-You got to get me out of here.You got to get...

34:55.049 --> 34:57.356
I've never done this before.
I don't want to kill him.

34:57.399 --> 34:58.444
Better you than Jingles.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.405
If-if I kill you, I'm so sorry.

35:03.449 --> 35:05.015
Just get me off of it.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.278
On three.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.584
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

35:08.628 --> 35:09.759
Ready?

35:09.803 --> 35:11.326
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

35:12.849 --> 35:13.850
Three!

35:18.551 --> 35:21.075
TREVOR:He's coming. Let's go, let's go.

35:42.879 --> 35:45.360
-Okay...

35:45.404 --> 35:47.232
Hey. Hey.

35:52.367 --> 35:55.370
-Hey, hey, hey, Chet.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.372
-Hey.
-Shh.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.254
We could take him.

36:09.297 --> 36:11.517
There's three of us.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.260
Chet can barely move
and Jingles has a knife.

36:16.435 --> 36:18.393
His knife...

36:18.437 --> 36:19.655
versus my guns.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.535
-Welcome to your
own petard, asshole!

36:34.148 --> 36:35.454
Holy shit!

36:35.497 --> 36:37.891
-That was awesome!

36:39.545 --> 36:41.242
-Oh, man.

36:42.678 --> 36:44.158
Oh. Hey.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.378
You shouldn't be
moving around, man.

36:48.423 --> 36:51.296
Just so we're all clear:
that...

36:51.339 --> 36:53.472
wasn't Jingles.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.088
-Hey, uh...
-Shit.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.699
They're not here.

37:03.743 --> 37:05.484
RAY:
Well, someone definitely was.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.618
What are you doing?

37:09.662 --> 37:11.446
We got to get to the call box.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.492
Seriously, Montana,

37:13.535 --> 37:14.928
the sooner we get to the road,
the faster the cops

37:14.971 --> 37:16.364
can handle all of this.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.548
That's the guy that stabbed me.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.333
Ready for round two?

37:29.377 --> 37:30.726
The devil needs his due.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.468
-Ray! What the hell?!

37:33.512 --> 37:35.470
-I'm sorry!
-You fucking coward!

37:35.514 --> 37:37.037
Ray!

37:38.604 --> 37:40.040
Fuck!

37:54.707 --> 37:56.361
Suck a nut, Camp Redwood.

37:56.404 --> 37:57.840
I'll see you in another life.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.322
Why the hell
haven't you killed her yet?

38:53.896 --> 38:56.899
