WEBVTT

00:39.539 --> 00:40.582
Excuse us.

00:43.501 --> 00:44.627
Duchess.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.337
Nice to meet you. I'm Lino.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.256
Follow me.

00:51.301 --> 00:55.513
The larger rooms
to the west are not available.

00:56.139 --> 01:00.518
I ask that you use only
the small rooms in the back

01:02.020 --> 01:04.147
and the gardens for the ceremony itself,

01:05.732 --> 01:10.445
the grand dining room for the reception.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.132
Your family,
they are from America?

01:31.216 --> 01:34.010
Texas, you say, the cow state?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.053
Yes.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.138
And you are from?

01:40.183 --> 01:43.561
She took one look
at a Black American and a Sicilian…

01:43.645 --> 01:47.524
We did it all by phone.
The reservations, the hotel, everything.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.902
Marrying in her precious mansion.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.160
"I remind you
the deposit is non-refundable."

02:00.703 --> 02:02.455
These decrepit
old aristocrats.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.958
But at least they have their snobbery.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.877
They have to rent their villas
to pay their taxes.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.005
And I would not be surprised
if your duchess hosted

02:11.089 --> 02:13.383
-one of Berlusconi's bunga-bunga parties.
-No!

02:18.138 --> 02:20.014
I'm sorry
about your parents, Lino.

02:20.098 --> 02:24.602
It would have been nice
to celebrate with them in a fancy villa.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.451
They've had the invitation
for over a year.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.662
You're very beautiful,
signorina.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.913
I've given you my life.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.415
And two children.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.670
I've put food on your plate,
day and night.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.880
Day and night.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.800
I've given you everything.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.512
But that's my son, Giacomo.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.180
He's our son.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.435
He should have asked me for permission.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.062
To fall in love?

17:02.771 --> 17:04.481
This is defiance.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.858
For love?

17:09.653 --> 17:10.571
First…

17:12.489 --> 17:13.866
when he left for school.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.995
And then when he ditched us…

17:21.290 --> 17:23.083
to play in the kitchen!

17:24.418 --> 17:26.545
The cook. The chef.

17:27.755 --> 17:28.589
The chef.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.970
He's… he's a disgrace.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.599
-He's my son, Giacomo!
-We're not going!

29:07.495 --> 29:11.666
Train is now boarding on track five.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.162
I'm home.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.248
I'm in Sicily.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.125
Your home is in America.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.585
Not here.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.253
Is it Lino?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.923
What are you saying? This is my home.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.800
Not anymore it's not.

31:26.801 --> 31:28.469
Do not come to town!

31:39.647 --> 31:41.149
We're not going.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.861
We're not going.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.034
We're not welcome.

32:15.266 --> 32:19.270
Everything is like dirt
on my tongue knowing that he's so close.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.401
Don't you see what you're doing to her?

32:26.611 --> 32:29.656
If you're standing, turn on the TV.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.916
Open it back up.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.380
Out of respect for you, I closed the door.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.051
And out of respect for you,
I missed Lino's wedding.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.928
Mama missed her son's wedding.

32:52.011 --> 32:56.057
And again out of respect for you,
your son still hasn't met his niece Lina.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.521
That's not her name.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.941
Her name is Rosalina.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.317
Her name is Lina.

33:06.859 --> 33:10.363
Because I named her after my brother.
A brother I want to see, Papa!

33:13.574 --> 33:14.450
You picked him.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.536
Do something.

33:45.815 --> 33:47.275
This is Amy, the--

33:47.358 --> 33:48.985
I know who you are.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.945
Lino doesn't know I'm calling you.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.572
Of course not.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.824
He's as stubborn as our father.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.494
What can we do?

33:58.578 --> 34:02.040
Lino really wants to meet Rosalina
and see you and his mother.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.417
Maybe he could visit
when your father is away.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.420
This is a small town.
My father would find out.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.839
The gossip would make things worse.

34:10.423 --> 34:13.217
-Understand?
-I'm trying.

34:13.301 --> 34:16.846
For my father to command respect,
we must follow his lead.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.057
To do otherwise would embarrass him

34:19.932 --> 34:22.351
and bring shame on the family.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.771
A punishment
that brings pain for everyone.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.481
Especially my mother.

34:30.401 --> 34:32.153
Then can you come to us?

34:33.237 --> 34:36.282
We're at Hotel Baia del Mare
on the outskirts of Cefalù.

34:36.365 --> 34:39.535
Away from Castelleone. No one would know.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.834
You need to meet us halfway.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.129
Your father must know
that we are extending an olive branch,

34:50.213 --> 34:52.298
the biggest in all of Sicily.

34:53.216 --> 34:56.677
Please, come on.
We have little time.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.721
I'm just happy you're still here.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.683
All right.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.770
My mother and I
will keep working on my father.

35:05.853 --> 35:06.979
We'll find a way.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.731
We'll meet you there at 6 p.m.

35:09.899 --> 35:10.733
We'll come.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.653
We'll be here at 6.

37:19.987 --> 37:21.364
What is this?

37:26.077 --> 37:26.994
Where's the sauce?

37:27.578 --> 37:28.412
We ran out.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.457
There's no more left.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.863
Your artwork is beautiful.

38:03.614 --> 38:07.326
I bet your work
would be amazing on canvas.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.120
The stone is my canvas.

38:10.413 --> 38:13.249
If it rains, I'll come back tomorrow.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.710
Would you like a photo?

38:25.011 --> 38:26.470
No, thank you.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.889
That's okay.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.406
I'm making sure
it's well-packaged for the trip.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.699
What's well-packaged?

38:46.782 --> 38:51.162
The cake we're taking back
to this man's friend in Los Angeles.

38:51.787 --> 38:54.623
-Wait, what?
-He's actually my third cousin. Antonio.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.668
He left here ages ago. He'll love it.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.179
Do you have an address
for your cousin Antonio?

39:08.262 --> 39:11.474
Of course.
He lives in the zone of Hollywood.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.219
I'm angry with my husband.

43:59.303 --> 44:02.348
I wanted to put a rock in his pasta.

44:02.973 --> 44:06.310
Instead, I put it on his side of the bed.

44:07.853 --> 44:08.687
Father, I…

44:10.147 --> 44:11.982
I denied him a satisfying meal.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.528
I took all of the sauce
that was meant for his pasta

44:17.029 --> 44:18.947
and ate it while he watched.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.078
I'm scared of my anger.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.288
I'm afraid.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.083
I don't know what I might do next.

44:29.917 --> 44:32.753
Father, help me, please.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.027
I want to write it all down.

45:00.447 --> 45:01.990
Everything I can remember.

45:54.793 --> 45:56.003
He's not here.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.381
Hope dies last.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.434
This is my wife.

46:25.449 --> 46:26.658
You're too thin.

46:26.742 --> 46:28.786
-Come on.
-And what is with that beard?

46:28.869 --> 46:29.828
Still so serious.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.830
She's always the same.

46:31.914 --> 46:34.333
Leave him alone. He's so handsome.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.751
I know he is.

46:35.834 --> 46:38.337
Come on, now, we don't have much time.

46:41.173 --> 46:43.008
God forbid he finds out, right?

46:43.592 --> 46:47.554
I couldn't be this close
to my son and not see him.

46:53.685 --> 46:56.730
Maria, you're too cute.

46:57.481 --> 47:01.109
Absolutely exquisite.

47:01.193 --> 47:04.071
I hope she has my temperament,
and your sense of adventure.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.282
We should go Mamma.

47:07.866 --> 47:09.117
It's late.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.412
I'll help you.

47:27.553 --> 47:28.554
I love you.

47:29.721 --> 47:31.223
I love you too, Mamma.

47:34.351 --> 47:35.978
But I won't come back here.

47:38.564 --> 47:40.816
-Because of her?
-That's not fair, Mamma.

47:41.316 --> 47:42.317
It's his fault.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.279
He made me choose.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.869
Amy is my wife.

47:53.704 --> 47:54.538
I choose her.

48:20.022 --> 48:21.690
Go with God.

48:22.524 --> 48:23.901
I'll look after her.
