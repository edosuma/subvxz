00:03.473 --> 00:07.175
We have no intention of dismantling
the regulatory agencies.

00:07.209 --> 00:09.177
However, we must
come to grips

00:09.211 --> 00:11.412
with inefficient
and burdensome regulations.

00:11.447 --> 00:13.281
<i>We will eliminate those</i>

00:13.315 --> 00:15.917
<i>that are unproductive</i>
<i>and unnecessary.</i>

00:15.951 --> 00:17.951
Tearing down
these antiquated walls

00:17.985 --> 00:20.019
and granting banks
significant new authority.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.388
<i>In a victory for</i>
<i>the banking industry,</i>

00:22.422 --> 00:25.224
<i>Congress has approved</i>
<i>legislation which will allow</i>

00:25.258 --> 00:27.226
<i>commercial and</i>
<i>investment banks to merge</i>

00:27.260 --> 00:29.194
<i>and form institutions</i>

00:29.229 --> 00:31.196
<i>of unprecedented size</i>
<i>and global reach.</i>

00:34.065 --> 00:36.066
<i>I think it's very important</i>

00:36.100 --> 00:39.035
for us not to introduce

00:39.069 --> 00:40.836
regulation
for regulation's sake.

00:40.870 --> 00:43.705
I do believe
in the American dream.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.540
<i>Owning a home</i>
<i>is a part of that dream.</i>

00:48.776 --> 00:50.543
<i>We are taking action</i>

00:50.578 --> 00:53.045
<i>to bring many thousands</i>
<i>of Americans</i>

00:53.080 --> 00:55.114
<i>closer to owning</i>
<i>a home.</i>

00:55.148 --> 00:57.316
This project
not only is good

00:57.350 --> 00:58.883
for the soul
of the country.

00:58.918 --> 01:00.818
It's good for the pocketbook
of the country as well.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.787
<i>The housing market has reached</i>
<i>frantic proportions.</i>

01:03.821 --> 01:06.990
<i>It seems that everybody is</i>
<i>building, buying or selling.</i>

01:07.024 --> 01:10.092
<i>The Dow and the S&P</i>
<i>both breaking records,</i>

01:10.127 --> 01:14.229
<i>profits soared 93%</i>
<i>at Goldman Sachs this year.</i>

01:14.263 --> 01:17.266
<i>Hotshot traders and bankers</i>
<i>can expect to take home</i>

01:17.300 --> 01:21.703
<i>$10, $25, and in some cases</i>
<i>$50 million.</i>

01:21.737 --> 01:24.572
Things that are too good
to be true, are.

01:24.606 --> 01:27.374
- <i>When you see something coming--</i>
- The real estate bubble.

01:27.408 --> 01:28.875
- Housing bubble--
- Bubble.

01:28.909 --> 01:32.178
<i>--Don't put it off.</i>
<i>take action immediately.</i>

01:32.212 --> 01:35.247
Will there be a soft landing
or will the bubble burst?

01:38.817 --> 01:41.618
<i>The new story--</i>
<i>the mortgage meltdown.</i>

01:41.653 --> 01:44.354
This morning in the mortgage
meltdown, new numbers showing

01:44.388 --> 01:47.623
that a record number of Americans
are losing their homes.

01:47.657 --> 01:49.624
More than 70 mortgage companies
have failed

01:49.659 --> 01:51.425
in the last few months
in America.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.427
and now the biggest of the big companies--
the Bear Stearns--

01:54.462 --> 01:56.729
the big banks are caught
holding the bag.

01:59.966 --> 02:02.800
<i>The fifth largest</i>
<i>investment bank in the country,</i>

02:02.834 --> 02:04.501
<i>Bear Stearns,</i>
<i>is being sold</i>

02:04.536 --> 02:07.740
<i>for just $2 a share</i>
<i>to J.P. Morgan.</i>

02:07.774 --> 02:09.741
It's being assisted
by the government

02:09.775 --> 02:12.445
which is stepping in
to guarantee some $30 billion

02:12.479 --> 02:15.248
<i>in Bear's toxic</i>
<i>real estate assets.</i>

02:17.751 --> 02:20.119
You've got to imagine
that Hank Paulson

02:20.153 --> 02:22.454
didn't think
he signed up for this

02:22.489 --> 02:24.389
when President Bush
picked him

02:24.423 --> 02:26.556
<i>to become</i>
<i>Treasury Secretary.</i>

02:26.591 --> 02:28.824
Hank Paulson
may now have to undo

02:28.858 --> 02:30.825
some of the deregulation
measures

02:30.859 --> 02:32.926
that he and his peers
on Wall Street pushed through

02:32.961 --> 02:36.096
<i>when he ran Goldman.</i>

02:36.130 --> 02:38.131
<i>Treasury Secretary</i>
<i>Hank Paulson</i>

02:38.165 --> 02:40.133
<i>telling Matt Lauer</i>
<i>this morning</i>

02:40.167 --> 02:43.201
<i>"We're all over it. I've got</i>
<i>great confidence in our markets.</i>

02:43.236 --> 02:45.069
They're resilient.
They're flexible."

02:45.104 --> 02:47.205
<i>Ali, the truth is</i>
<i>that Bear Stearns is</i>

02:47.239 --> 02:49.874
only a very small fraction
of this story.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.875
<i>our economy</i>
<i>could face</i>

02:51.909 --> 02:54.311
<i>far worse</i>
<i>than a recession.</i>

02:56.614 --> 02:58.882
<i>In the wake of</i>
<i>Bear's collapse,</i>

02:58.916 --> 03:01.484
<i>Lehman Brothers is scrambling</i>
<i>to reassure investors</i>

03:01.519 --> 03:03.787
<i>about the impact</i>
<i>of the mortgage crisis</i>

03:03.821 --> 03:05.588
on its own assets,
shares of the firm

03:05.622 --> 03:07.423
under a great deal
of pressure this morning.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.592
<i>Dick Fuld, a 39-year</i>
<i>veteran of Lehman</i>

03:10.627 --> 03:13.795
<i>and the longest-running CEO of a</i>
<i>major investment bank on Wall Street,</i>

03:13.830 --> 03:17.765
<i>has pulled the firm back from</i>
<i>the brink during other crises.</i>

03:17.799 --> 03:20.434
<i>But today, for the first time</i>
<i>that I'm hearing it,</i>

03:20.468 --> 03:23.170
<i>investors are questioning</i>
<i>his leadership.</i>

03:23.204 --> 03:26.272
- Motherfucker.
- <i>One key question investors</i>
<i>have for Lehman Brothers:</i>

03:26.307 --> 03:30.008
<i>What's the true earnings power</i>
<i>of this investment bank's business?</i>

03:35.615 --> 03:38.716
Hey.

03:38.751 --> 03:42.153
Get up here.
We gotta start stacking sandbags.

03:42.187 --> 03:43.487
What are you
talking about?

03:43.522 --> 03:46.056
We're down 21%.
On paper,

03:46.090 --> 03:49.859
I just lost $90 million
personally.

03:49.893 --> 03:52.161
<i>With investors pummeling</i>
<i>Lehman shares,</i>

03:52.195 --> 03:54.229
<i>the big question</i>
<i>this morning is--</i>

03:54.264 --> 03:56.231
<i>what options</i>
<i>does Fuld have?</i>

03:56.265 --> 03:58.699
<i>So far he has failed</i>
<i>to raise new capital</i>

03:58.734 --> 04:01.268
<i>while virtually all of his</i>
<i>rivals have already done so.</i>

04:01.303 --> 04:03.670
<i>And now hedge fund manager</i>
<i>David Einhorn</i>

04:03.704 --> 04:06.205
<i>is publicly questioning the accuracy</i>
<i>of the firm's numbers.</i>

04:06.240 --> 04:07.373
Anything good?

04:07.407 --> 04:11.576
It's a red-tailed hawk,
the first one this year.

04:11.610 --> 04:13.143
Dick Fuld's on one.

04:13.177 --> 04:15.378
<i>They haven't been able</i>
<i>to provide credible answers.</i>

04:15.412 --> 04:17.413
So let's go through
a couple of those

04:17.447 --> 04:19.582
what you call
discrepancies, because--

04:23.119 --> 04:24.552
Tough morning?

04:24.586 --> 04:27.554
We show top-quality earnings.
We beat every prediction.

04:27.588 --> 04:29.822
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's the damn short-sellers.

04:29.856 --> 04:31.891
You know the game--
short and distort.

04:31.925 --> 04:34.760
They're rumormongers.
And they're making a killing.

04:34.794 --> 04:36.861
What are your plans
for a capital raise?

04:36.896 --> 04:40.498
We're way ahead of you.
Now let me be clear:

04:40.532 --> 04:42.833
<i>we don't need the cash.</i>

04:44.535 --> 04:46.870
You know,
it's about perception.

04:46.904 --> 04:48.571
Buffett, Buffett.

04:48.606 --> 04:52.508
We're thinking of reaching out
to Warren Buffett.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.508
Great.

04:53.542 --> 04:57.311
You and Buffett
go back, right?

04:57.345 --> 04:59.847
Do me a favor
and call him.

04:59.881 --> 05:02.016
Tell him
Lehman is rock solid.

05:02.050 --> 05:06.052
As Treasury Secretary, I can't
advocate for a specific investment.

05:08.888 --> 05:14.058
Hank, you want me
to raise capital or not?

05:14.092 --> 05:16.960
<i>Lehman Brothers is a hell of</i>
<i>a lot bigger than Bear Stearns.</i>

05:16.994 --> 05:19.095
<i>The market</i>
<i>is terrified.</i>

05:19.130 --> 05:21.831
When I was running Goldman,
I never even conceived

05:21.866 --> 05:24.567
of asking the Treasury Secretary
to cut a deal for me.

05:24.601 --> 05:26.034
Yeah, but the Bear
bailout created--

05:26.068 --> 05:27.402
Please don't call it
a bailout.

05:27.436 --> 05:31.439
Okay, the very large Bear Stearns
purchase assistance package

05:31.473 --> 05:33.440
created an expectation.

05:33.475 --> 05:35.309
Fuld's counting on direct
intervention from you.

05:35.343 --> 05:37.678
Uh, Buffett's
a simple solution.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.781
I think
you make the call.

05:40.815 --> 05:43.116
As what?
Warren's friend?

05:43.150 --> 05:45.351
His former banker?
The ?

05:45.386 --> 05:48.153
No.
Fuld's calling him.

05:48.187 --> 05:50.021
Hopefully he'll jump in
and we can all relax.

05:50.055 --> 05:52.023
Relax? We just buried
one investment bank;

05:52.057 --> 05:54.058
We got another one
that's barely breathing.

05:54.093 --> 05:56.760
This is a confidence game.
People lose faith in Lehman--

05:56.795 --> 05:58.762
these banks are gonna
drop like dominos

05:58.796 --> 06:01.865
and I don't have the authority
to do a thing about it.

06:01.899 --> 06:03.833
We're late.

06:03.868 --> 06:05.768
We've been late
on everything.

06:05.802 --> 06:08.737
Neel's team is working on some
kind of a disaster scenario.

06:08.771 --> 06:10.639
We're calling it
the break-the-glass plan--

06:10.673 --> 06:13.307
what to ask Congress for
if your back's against the wall.

06:13.342 --> 06:14.708
Money...

06:15.743 --> 06:18.545
Is what you
ask them for.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.981
The problem is,
Congress won't move

06:22.015 --> 06:23.783
until we've already
hit the iceberg,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.351
and at that point
it may be too late.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.353
So you're saying,
with the full weight

06:27.387 --> 06:29.955
of the United States Treasury
behind me,

06:29.990 --> 06:33.725
all I can do is
call Warren Buffett?

06:33.759 --> 06:37.694
<i>Hi, Warren.</i>
<i>It's Hank.</i>

06:37.729 --> 06:40.463
I understand you've been
talking to Dick Fuld.

06:40.498 --> 06:43.166
You know my
misgivings, Hank,

06:43.200 --> 06:46.001
about investment banks.

06:46.036 --> 06:48.737
As soon as they started
trading for themselves,

06:48.771 --> 06:50.805
the risk managers
lost control.

06:50.839 --> 06:53.574
I had a very unpleasant time
with Solomon Brothers.

06:53.608 --> 06:55.709
That's fair enough.

06:56.844 --> 06:58.444
But we both know

06:58.479 --> 07:01.080
that investment banking
is a profitable business.

07:01.114 --> 07:04.715
I figure it made <i>you</i>
a billionaire somewhat.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.185
I gotta believe that
if the price was right,

07:07.219 --> 07:08.920
you wouldn't
just walk away.

07:08.955 --> 07:11.656
You know a good deal
when you see one.

07:11.691 --> 07:13.625
What say you?

07:13.659 --> 07:16.294
I gotta leave that
to your judgment.

07:17.462 --> 07:19.496
People act like
we're crack dealers.

07:19.531 --> 07:21.498
Nobody put a gun
to anybody's head and said,

07:21.532 --> 07:23.399
"hey, Nimrod, buy a house
you can't afford.

07:23.434 --> 07:25.134
And you know what?
While you're at it,

07:25.169 --> 07:27.236
put a line of credit on that baby
and buy yourself a boat."

07:27.270 --> 07:29.905
You heard anything
from Buffett?

07:29.939 --> 07:32.573
He's asking for
preferred shares at 40

07:32.608 --> 07:34.408
with a dividend
of 9%.

07:34.443 --> 07:36.910
We were just at 66.
What the fuck?

07:36.944 --> 07:38.945
Maybe it's just
an opening gambit, Dick.

07:38.979 --> 07:40.613
Sounds more like
a goddamn insult.

07:40.647 --> 07:42.147
- Let me get that, Dick.
- Thank you.

07:42.182 --> 07:43.849
We're at 36 right now.

07:43.883 --> 07:47.285
We haven't been anywhere
near 66 in months.

07:47.319 --> 07:49.287
The markets
like Buffett.

07:49.321 --> 07:51.055
His name will push
the price up overnight.

07:51.089 --> 07:53.056
You know, I don't care
who he is,

07:53.091 --> 07:55.859
I am not spending
$360 million a year

07:55.893 --> 07:57.661
for the pleasure of doing
business with him.

07:57.695 --> 07:58.829
Real estate
will come back.

07:58.863 --> 08:00.463
The Koreans have been
sniffing around.

08:00.498 --> 08:02.331
There you go.
And they won't steal us blind.

08:02.366 --> 08:05.200
I've seen this before--
C.E.O.s panic and they sell out cheap.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.969
Right now the street's running
around with its hair on fire,

08:08.003 --> 08:10.071
but the storm
always passes.

08:10.105 --> 08:12.305
We stand strong,
and on the other side

08:12.340 --> 08:14.574
we'll eat
Goldman's lunch.

08:17.010 --> 08:18.711
So what do we do
about Buffett?

08:18.745 --> 08:21.346
Screw Warren Buffett.

08:23.382 --> 08:25.616
<i>He passed?</i>

08:25.651 --> 08:27.552
Lehman dropped to 28 1/2
this morning.

08:27.586 --> 08:28.986
What in the world
is he thinking?

08:29.021 --> 08:30.821
He's not thinking.
He's delusional.

08:30.856 --> 08:32.688
He thought the ask
was too high.

08:32.724 --> 08:35.525
He's got to raise cash.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.393
I told him that.

08:37.428 --> 08:40.096
I spoke to Greenspan.

08:40.130 --> 08:41.597
Really?

08:41.631 --> 08:44.131
He says there's too much
housing supply.

08:44.167 --> 08:47.268
That's the problem.

08:47.303 --> 08:50.904
So we should buy up
all the vacant houses

08:50.939 --> 08:53.640
and burn them.

08:58.978 --> 09:02.714
Dick needs a buyer--
someone with a grip on reality.

09:02.748 --> 09:04.982
Barclays expressed some interest
a couple of months ago,

09:05.017 --> 09:06.884
But I don't think
the price is low enough for them.

09:06.918 --> 09:08.819
Bank of America?

09:08.854 --> 09:11.989
Possible. Dick's put out
feelers there before.

09:12.024 --> 09:14.559
We have to keep it
quiet though.

09:14.593 --> 09:16.794
If anyone hears that
they're trying to sell...

09:16.828 --> 09:19.930
Lehman will be dead
within the hour.

09:19.964 --> 09:22.633
The real estate investments
are killing the firm.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.235
We have to admit publically
we've made some mistakes.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.471
We need to make
a senior management change,

09:27.505 --> 09:29.573
Signal to the market
that we get it.

09:29.607 --> 09:31.974
Meaning what?

09:32.009 --> 09:34.210
Meaning Joe Gregory.

09:34.244 --> 09:36.711
Get the fuck
out of here.

09:38.147 --> 09:40.648
You are not gonna tell me
how to run my company.

09:40.682 --> 09:43.450
Joe hasn't had your back on risk,
and everyone knows it.

09:43.485 --> 09:45.119
Erin Callan's
gotta go too.

09:45.153 --> 09:47.187
As far as the street's
concerned, she's a joke.

09:47.221 --> 09:49.222
Joe Gregory has been
with me

09:49.256 --> 09:52.291
for 30 years.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.293
And you want me
to kick him to the curb

09:54.327 --> 09:55.861
because we have
a bad quarter?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.496
It's not just
a bad quarter.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.464
The stock hit 23.

09:59.498 --> 10:03.066
23. Most of our guys are
paid in stock they can't sell for years.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.035
They've lost most of their net worth
over the last six months.

10:06.070 --> 10:08.036
You don't stabilize
the price,

10:08.071 --> 10:10.005
Your traders
are gonna jump ship.

10:10.039 --> 10:11.839
Selfish fucks.

10:11.874 --> 10:14.075
It's not just bankers
and traders, Dick.

10:14.109 --> 10:15.743
Clients are pulling
their money.

10:15.777 --> 10:17.945
There's gonna be a run
on this bank.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.217
Sources tell CNBC
that both

10:24.251 --> 10:27.754
Erin Callan and Joseph Gregory
are out at Lehman Brothers.

10:27.789 --> 10:30.257
<i>In a statement, the company's</i>
<i>chairman Dick Fuld said</i>

10:30.291 --> 10:33.059
<i>Replacing Gregory with</i>
<i>48-year-old Bart McDade</i>

10:33.093 --> 10:36.362
<i>has been one of the most</i>
<i>difficult decisions he's had to make.</i>

10:38.130 --> 10:41.365
Dick, the Koreans just
arrived at Sullivan.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.467
Let's make this happen.

10:43.501 --> 10:46.670
My take is you'd be better off
staying here for now.

10:48.206 --> 10:50.140
We need you to be
our missing man.

10:50.174 --> 10:53.075
We'll go in and push
the deal as far as we can,

10:53.110 --> 10:56.845
And then we'll bring you in
at the end to top it off.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.079
All right, fine.

10:58.114 --> 11:00.848
Okay.

11:06.488 --> 11:09.222
We are committed
to our presence in New York.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.693
But we need to know that the
underlying numbers make sense.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.430
We realize
how things look.

11:19.465 --> 11:22.866
<i>But our stock is getting</i>
<i>hammered by the shorts.</i>

11:22.900 --> 11:24.901
<i>The value</i>
<i>is still there.</i>

11:26.470 --> 11:28.671
We just started.
Min is excited,

11:28.706 --> 11:30.373
but we haven't heard
the terms.

11:30.407 --> 11:32.975
Where are you?

11:33.010 --> 11:34.644
I just stepped out
to take the call.

11:34.678 --> 11:37.180
Get back in there.
Don't be rude.

11:37.214 --> 11:38.982
Okay.

11:40.451 --> 11:43.319
We simply take the assets
you don't find appealing,

11:43.354 --> 11:46.356
spin them off
into a separate company.

11:48.226 --> 11:50.927
- <i>You don't buy that bank.</i>
- I'm very sorry.

11:50.962 --> 11:54.364
<i>You buy the good bank.</i>

11:55.499 --> 11:57.365
They don't like
the real estate.

11:57.399 --> 11:58.799
What do you mean,
they don't like it?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.801
Dick, we're making
real progress here, okay?

12:00.835 --> 12:02.702
Let me stay on it
for now.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:18.485 --> 12:20.853
Min, how are you?

12:20.887 --> 12:23.288
<i>Great to see you.</i>

12:23.323 --> 12:25.857
I don't want
to interrupt.

12:25.892 --> 12:27.792
Dick, great timing.

12:27.827 --> 12:30.862
We seem to be in sync on the
broad strokes of the deal.

12:30.897 --> 12:33.365
Shall we get back
to the letter of intent?

12:33.399 --> 12:35.633
Min, I have to
tell you,

12:35.668 --> 12:38.336
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

12:38.370 --> 12:41.005
There's great value
in the real estate assets.

12:41.039 --> 12:44.173
How about we walk
through the portfolio

12:44.207 --> 12:46.542
and I'll show you?

12:48.244 --> 12:50.546
We have looked at them.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.481
Well, then you--

12:52.515 --> 12:54.649
you must have looked at them
in the wrong way.

12:54.684 --> 12:58.352
I just don't want to see you
leave money on the table.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.621
Perhaps we should
take a break.

13:06.996 --> 13:09.097
Min, I'm so sorry.

13:09.131 --> 13:11.098
We have negotiated
in good faith.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.333
Now all of a sudden
we are going backward?

13:13.367 --> 13:14.933
We can work with you
on the price.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.868
It is not about
the price.

13:16.902 --> 13:20.003
It is about the way
you have conducted this.

13:25.607 --> 13:29.210
I'd like to thank you,
all of you,

13:29.244 --> 13:32.112
<i>but I don't think we have</i>
<i>a structure that works.</i>

13:38.384 --> 13:40.430
What, that's it?

13:40.455 --> 13:42.520
You're just gonna pack up
and go back to Korea?

13:55.999 --> 13:58.100
- Hello.
- <i>Neel, it's Dick Fuld.</i>

13:58.135 --> 14:01.137
Listen, you know,

14:01.171 --> 14:03.039
if Hank wants me
to find a buyer,

14:03.073 --> 14:04.774
you guys need
to step up and help.

14:04.808 --> 14:07.110
<i>The Koreans just</i>
<i>walked out, okay?</i>

14:07.144 --> 14:09.112
Look, I'm just speaking
for myself here,

14:09.146 --> 14:11.714
but I think you need to do
what's right for the firm.

14:11.749 --> 14:13.349
Do what's right?

14:13.384 --> 14:15.084
What is that supposed
to mean?

14:15.119 --> 14:17.053
If your stock price
keeps sliding,

14:17.087 --> 14:20.089
you may get an offer at a price
that doesn't look all that compelling,

14:20.124 --> 14:22.926
but you may have to take it just
to keep the company intact.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.760
What kind of price
are you talking about?

14:24.795 --> 14:26.395
Could be--

14:26.429 --> 14:28.897
I mean, it might be
low single digits.

14:30.767 --> 14:33.201
Last February

14:33.236 --> 14:36.605
we were
at 66 a share.

14:36.639 --> 14:41.110
Lehman Brothers is not
bear stearns.

14:41.145 --> 14:42.945
We've got
a great business.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.847
Real estate's gonna
come back.

14:44.881 --> 14:48.083
I am not fucking
giving this company away!

14:48.117 --> 14:49.633
While the real estate market

14:49.658 --> 14:51.158
has put Lehman Brothers shares
under pressure,

14:51.188 --> 14:53.489
mortgage giants Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac stocks

14:53.523 --> 14:56.058
are suddenly plummeting
this morning after reports

14:56.092 --> 14:58.795
the companies may need
to raise $75 billion

14:58.829 --> 15:01.998
just to remain solvent.
Because they guarantee

15:02.032 --> 15:04.434
such an enormous percentage
of the nation's mortgages,

15:04.469 --> 15:06.636
there is renewed speculation
that the government

15:06.671 --> 15:08.305
may have to step in
and take them over--

15:08.339 --> 15:12.675
<i>a possibility Barack Obama has</i>
<i>now raised on the campaign trail.</i>

15:12.709 --> 15:15.011
If Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac collapsed,

15:15.045 --> 15:18.747
then probably
the financial system

15:18.782 --> 15:21.183
would receive
such a body blow

15:21.217 --> 15:23.786
that it could be
disastrous.

15:23.820 --> 15:26.221
Freddie just
dropped another 8%.

15:26.255 --> 15:28.690
Fannie's down 5%.

15:28.724 --> 15:31.559
There's-- there's no
bottom here.

15:31.593 --> 15:34.795
We need to do
something now.

15:34.829 --> 15:36.763
We're working on
a proposal for Congress,

15:36.797 --> 15:39.299
see if we can get the authority
to put some money in.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.334
I'd rather not go
that way,

15:41.368 --> 15:43.635
but if we get there...

15:43.669 --> 15:46.537
Uh, I think--
I think we're already there.

15:48.339 --> 15:50.073
<i>How much are you</i>
<i>gonna ask for?</i>

15:50.107 --> 15:51.708
A blank check.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.111
It has to be enough of a statement
to reassure the market.

15:55.145 --> 15:59.015
They need to think I've got
a bazooka in my pocket.

15:59.049 --> 16:01.017
I'm not saying
that we use it,

16:01.051 --> 16:03.018
but if we have
the authority,

16:03.053 --> 16:05.020
everyone who's dumping
their shares

16:05.054 --> 16:07.088
will calm down,
back off.

16:07.123 --> 16:09.090
Okay, well, if you're
going to Congress,

16:09.124 --> 16:10.858
why don't we give
to the banks too?

16:10.892 --> 16:13.126
'Cause Lehman is looking like shit
and Merrill's not far behind.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.962
We'll be lucky to get them to move
on Fannie and Freddie.

16:15.996 --> 16:18.364
We do what we can do.

16:29.306 --> 16:31.773
Secretary, Mrs. Paulson,
over here.

16:31.807 --> 16:34.842
Over here, please.

16:34.876 --> 16:37.411
Mr. and Mrs. Paulson.

16:37.446 --> 16:41.449
- <i>Secretary Paulson.</i>
- <i>Mrs. Paulson. Thank you.</i>

16:41.484 --> 16:43.151
<i>Mrs. Paulson.</i>

16:43.186 --> 16:45.020
Mr. Paulson.

16:45.054 --> 16:47.555
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Paulson,</i>
<i>this way, please.</i>

16:51.124 --> 16:53.158
<i>Mr. Secretary, please.</i>

16:53.192 --> 16:55.027
I got her.

16:56.596 --> 16:58.964
<i>Right over here,</i>
<i>Secretary Paulson, please.</i>

16:58.998 --> 17:00.865
<i>Big smile.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:00.900 --> 17:03.434
That's just what I need--
press photos

17:03.468 --> 17:06.068
of the Treasury Secretary
waving the Chinese flag.

17:06.102 --> 17:08.602
Paulson the Communist.

17:08.637 --> 17:11.571
The look on your face
was priceless.

17:11.606 --> 17:16.111
Hank, I must ask you
about Fannie and Freddie.

17:18.513 --> 17:20.782
We have hundreds
of billions invested.

17:20.817 --> 17:23.853
You've assured us
the investment is safe.

17:23.887 --> 17:26.721
And it is,
absolutely.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.725
We're watching a great deal
of our money disappear.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.161
Share prices
have dropped 60%

17:33.195 --> 17:35.263
in the last
two months.

17:35.297 --> 17:37.998
Carrying your bazooka around
has not helped matters.

17:38.033 --> 17:40.500
Congress gave you
the power.

17:40.535 --> 17:42.302
Perhaps it is time
to use it.

17:42.336 --> 17:44.237
The market
will stabilize.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.138
We just have
to give it some time.

17:46.173 --> 17:50.009
There was an approach
last month from Russia.

17:50.043 --> 17:52.277
They have
considerable holdings

17:52.312 --> 17:53.979
in Fannie and Freddie
as well.

17:54.013 --> 17:56.814
They suggested
we coordinate

17:56.849 --> 17:58.883
and without warning dump
hundreds of billions

17:58.917 --> 18:01.251
of Fannie and Freddie's bonds
onto the market.

18:03.621 --> 18:05.288
That would be...

18:05.323 --> 18:07.323
Yes.

18:07.358 --> 18:10.393
The amount of debt
your country carries

18:10.427 --> 18:13.262
is a terrible
vulnerability.

18:17.232 --> 18:18.432
But you--

18:18.467 --> 18:21.735
we declined
respectfully.

18:24.138 --> 18:26.205
Even in the U.S.
it seems

18:26.240 --> 18:29.875
the relationship between the
government and private industry

18:29.910 --> 18:32.110
isn't so simple.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.881
Was it a threat?

18:36.915 --> 18:40.384
No no, it was
a friendly reminder

18:40.419 --> 18:42.386
that with a single
phone call to Moscow

18:42.421 --> 18:44.822
they can take down
the entire U.S. economy.

18:52.497 --> 18:55.132
Well, the book says

18:55.166 --> 18:57.201
Fannie and Freddie
are a nightmare.

18:57.235 --> 18:59.536
They are in the hole easily
tens of billions of dollars.

18:59.570 --> 19:02.338
In another few weeks they're
gonna start defaulting on their debts.

19:02.373 --> 19:03.839
We're gonna have to
step in.

19:03.874 --> 19:06.976
I don't see
how we can avoid it.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.747
Turns out a bazooka's
not that useful

19:10.781 --> 19:12.582
unless you fire it.

19:14.251 --> 19:16.351
Lehman's down
another 10%.

19:16.386 --> 19:18.787
You are not gonna let me
get down a single bite, are you?

19:18.821 --> 19:20.355
That's why
I have oatmeal.

19:20.389 --> 19:23.057
Dick is trotting around the world
with his head in his hands

19:23.092 --> 19:24.859
and no one will
give him any money.

19:24.894 --> 19:27.162
Korea walked out on him.
Mexico told him to shove it.

19:27.196 --> 19:29.364
No one's interested.
All the dumb money's already in.

19:29.398 --> 19:31.232
What about B of A?
Are they still in the mix?

19:31.267 --> 19:33.635
And Barclays is
sniffing around again,

19:33.669 --> 19:35.503
now that they think
it's a fire sale.

19:35.537 --> 19:36.871
That's promising.

19:36.905 --> 19:38.806
I don't know.
The British--

19:38.841 --> 19:42.510
they do a lot of talking.
They never close.

19:42.544 --> 19:44.646
B of A is still
our best bet.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.180
This can't be
another Bear.

19:46.215 --> 19:47.339
Absolutely not.

19:47.364 --> 19:49.164
They want Lehman--
they buy it outright.

19:49.184 --> 19:50.918
But they may need
a little hand-holding.

19:50.953 --> 19:53.454
They just bought Countrywide.
They're spread a little thin.

19:53.489 --> 19:55.356
You may have to
give them a break

19:55.390 --> 19:57.091
with the capital
requirements.

19:57.125 --> 20:00.261
You want me to allow them
to raise their leverage

20:00.295 --> 20:02.797
so they can buy a bank
that's about to fail

20:02.831 --> 20:04.999
because it was
overleveraged?

20:05.033 --> 20:08.002
You got a better idea?

20:08.036 --> 20:11.138
Breaking news just coming in:
Sources telling CNBC

20:11.173 --> 20:13.374
that the government
has just taken control

20:13.409 --> 20:15.644
of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.

20:15.678 --> 20:17.646
Back in July, you remember,
Hank Paulson said

20:17.681 --> 20:19.649
that he wanted
the power to step in,

20:19.683 --> 20:21.484
but he probably
wouldn't use it.

20:21.519 --> 20:23.287
It certainly sounds
like Paulson

20:23.321 --> 20:24.955
just pulled the trigger
on that bazooka.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.192
<i>Despite the move nationalize</i>
<i>Fannie and Freddie,</i>

20:27.226 --> 20:30.395
<i>the market is still in negative</i>
<i>territory across the board.</i>

20:30.429 --> 20:33.698
<i>Investors now focusing their attention</i>
<i>on Lehman Brothers</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:36.801
<i>amid fresh reports that the nation's</i>
<i>fourth largest investment bank</i>

20:36.835 --> 20:39.103
<i>may be on the brink</i>
<i>of bankruptcy.</i>

20:39.137 --> 20:41.405
- Rodge.
- Chris.

20:41.439 --> 20:44.005
Bring your money
today, huh?

20:46.739 --> 20:50.107
Make sure Fuld's not keeping
any bad news out of the mix.

20:50.141 --> 20:53.208
It's open kimono,
to quote Dick.

20:53.243 --> 20:55.877
There's a revolting image.

20:58.480 --> 21:01.315
Did you get a look
at the numbers?

21:01.349 --> 21:02.950
The real estate's
the issue.

21:02.984 --> 21:04.952
They got it marked
at $30 billion.

21:04.987 --> 21:06.988
It's worth maybe
half of that.

21:07.022 --> 21:08.923
Don't look so nervous.

21:08.957 --> 21:12.093
You're about to get a Wall Street
bank for the price of a hot dog.

21:12.127 --> 21:15.596
I know that Paulson told Ken Lewis
that he's not gonna pay for this.

21:15.630 --> 21:17.297
And I don't see
how we can do it

21:17.332 --> 21:19.399
unless the government takes
some of the downside.

21:19.434 --> 21:21.167
Paulson is posturing.

21:21.202 --> 21:22.869
He'll write a check
just like he did

21:22.904 --> 21:24.514
for Jamie Dimon
on the Bear deal.

21:24.539 --> 21:26.021
He has to.
He can't lose

21:26.022 --> 21:28.314
another major bank
in an election year.

21:28.342 --> 21:30.310
Besides,
the guy made, like,

21:30.344 --> 21:32.512
a half a billion bucks
at Goldman Sachs.

21:32.546 --> 21:35.582
He lets Lehman die--
Goldman's biggest competitor--

21:35.616 --> 21:37.851
makes him look like he's
still working for Goldman;

21:37.885 --> 21:40.887
he's just doing it
out of the desk at Treasury.

21:42.523 --> 21:45.858
Where are the donuts?

21:45.893 --> 21:48.328
Exactly.  If you're the CEO
of one of these financial firms,

21:48.362 --> 21:50.897
you've already seen what the
government was willing to do.

21:50.932 --> 21:53.267
Why wouldn't you play
chicken with them and say,

21:53.301 --> 21:56.771
"Sure I'll help you out.
But you gotta throw in a sweetener,

21:56.805 --> 21:58.573
<i>just like you did</i>
<i>for those guys"?</i>

22:00.242 --> 22:03.177
They just assume
I'm gonna bail out Dick Fuld

22:03.212 --> 22:06.347
like I'm the guy behind the
elephant with the shovel.

22:06.381 --> 22:08.315
They're all drawing
a line from Bear

22:08.350 --> 22:10.217
and Fannie and Freddie
right to Lehman.

22:10.251 --> 22:12.051
There's no way the taxpayers
are gonna go for another bailout--

22:12.085 --> 22:14.686
A very large
purchase assistance package.

22:14.721 --> 22:17.856
We need to come up with
a private-sector solution,

22:17.891 --> 22:20.191
get the investment banks
to bridge the gap.

22:20.226 --> 22:22.026
Okay, but that's
never gonna work,

22:22.060 --> 22:23.927
unless they believe
that you've drawn a line.

22:23.962 --> 22:27.330
I know you don't like leaking,
but let us reach out to the press.

22:33.402 --> 22:34.836
Okay.

22:37.205 --> 22:39.373
Mr. Flowers,

22:39.407 --> 22:41.775
there's a call for you--
Bob Willumstad from A.I.G.

22:41.810 --> 22:44.077
He's very insistent.

22:49.149 --> 22:51.283
Mr. Flowers.

22:51.318 --> 22:53.651
My people tell me
you're the man to talk to.

22:53.686 --> 22:55.186
We've got a real
problem here.

22:55.220 --> 22:56.754
Yeah? What kind
of problem?

22:56.788 --> 23:00.024
It looks very much like we are
about to run out of cash.

23:00.058 --> 23:01.458
A.I.G.?

23:01.493 --> 23:03.560
We've sent over a document.
It's a spreadsheet.

23:03.595 --> 23:06.463
It's confidential, of course,
but it might give you some insight.

23:06.497 --> 23:09.132
I'm in the middle of Lehman.
I'm working with B of A.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.034
Is there any way
you could come over tomorrow?

23:12.069 --> 23:14.137
I'll take a look
at the numbers

23:14.171 --> 23:16.305
and we'll talk.

23:21.445 --> 23:23.613
Mr. Flowers.

23:27.018 --> 23:28.718
<i>Somebody put</i>
<i>the TV on.</i>

23:28.753 --> 23:31.188
CNBC's talking
about Lehman.

23:35.860 --> 23:39.129
...Person familiar
with Paulson's--

23:39.164 --> 23:41.298
Treasury Secretary
Hank Paulson's thinking,

23:41.333 --> 23:43.834
and he is saying there will
be no government money

23:43.868 --> 23:46.136
<i>in the resolution</i>
<i>of this situation.</i>

23:46.170 --> 23:48.805
They're saying two things
make the Lehman deal different:

23:48.840 --> 23:51.007
The market's been aware
and had time to prepare

23:51.042 --> 23:53.377
for over six months;
And the second is...

23:53.411 --> 23:55.945
Is that just
TV bullshit,

23:55.980 --> 23:59.114
or is that Paulson
sending us a message?

24:00.050 --> 24:01.517
Chris?

24:08.692 --> 24:10.426
Yeah? Sorry.

24:13.629 --> 24:14.923
What exactly does

24:14.948 --> 24:17.269
"a person familiar with
the Treasury Secretary" mean?

24:17.299 --> 24:19.400
That could mean
a lot of things.

24:19.434 --> 24:21.168
Did one of your
staffers do this?

24:21.202 --> 24:23.303
Please tell me someone got fired
10 minutes ago.

24:23.337 --> 24:25.404
The leak came from me.

24:27.307 --> 24:29.108
Hank, a public statement
like that

24:29.142 --> 24:31.110
can have a lot of
unintended consequences.

24:31.144 --> 24:33.078
We had to send a message
to the other banks.

24:33.112 --> 24:34.300
They need to step up.

24:34.325 --> 24:36.238
I don't have another rabbit
I can pull out of my hat.

24:37.349 --> 24:40.051
Rodgin Cohen
just called me.

24:40.085 --> 24:43.456
The B of A team is sitting there
playing brick breaker on their phones.

24:43.491 --> 24:44.926
They don't want this deal.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.431
The deal is hanging
by a thread

24:47.465 --> 24:49.301
because the closer
they get to Lehman

24:49.335 --> 24:51.603
the more it looks
like a toxic waste dump.

24:51.638 --> 24:55.040
Which is why at the end of the day
we may have to help them,

24:55.075 --> 24:58.777
which would be a lot easier
if we didn't publicly state that--

24:58.812 --> 25:00.880
We can't, Tim.
Legally we can't.

25:00.914 --> 25:03.182
Legally we haven't
figured out

25:03.216 --> 25:07.052
how yet.

25:07.086 --> 25:11.023
I am concerned

25:11.057 --> 25:13.691
we are limiting
our options

25:13.725 --> 25:16.959
at a time when we have
very few,

25:16.994 --> 25:19.027
if any, available.

25:21.597 --> 25:25.200
I want all the C.E.O.s
in a room.

25:25.234 --> 25:27.169
We've got the weekend.

25:27.203 --> 25:29.571
We lock them in a room
at the Fed

25:29.606 --> 25:33.275
and we don't let them out until
they have a solution on Lehman.

25:33.310 --> 25:35.310
Your oatmeal's
getting cold.

25:35.345 --> 25:38.379
They'll figure it out.
They'll all throw in some money.

25:40.048 --> 25:42.016
Well, Tim is
advocating strongly

25:42.050 --> 25:44.051
that we reconsider
some kind of Fed support.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.287
Tim wants us to pick up
the tab on everyone.

25:46.321 --> 25:48.822
I can't be
Mr. bailout.

25:48.856 --> 25:52.358
The Lehman hole is
twice what Bear's was.

25:52.393 --> 25:54.360
Investors are pulling
their accounts.

25:54.394 --> 25:56.929
You want to lend
into a run?

25:56.963 --> 25:59.164
What about Barclays?
Are they still interested?

25:59.198 --> 26:02.000
They can't afford the risk
any more than B of A can.

26:02.034 --> 26:05.537
I don't doubt your ability to talk
anybody into submission,

26:05.572 --> 26:07.706
but it is still
a long shot.

26:07.741 --> 26:11.578
And there's a very real possibility
that Lehman goes under.

26:11.612 --> 26:15.047
There's a deal
to be made here.

26:15.082 --> 26:17.850
I'm gonna make the deal.

26:17.884 --> 26:19.952
<i>With just a little more</i>
<i>than an hour</i>

26:19.987 --> 26:21.821
<i>left until</i>
<i>the market closes,</i>

26:21.855 --> 26:24.224
<i>shares of Lehman Brothers</i>
<i>have taken another tumble.</i>

26:24.258 --> 26:26.293
<i>The stock is now</i>
<i>trading at a new low--</i>

26:26.327 --> 26:28.228
<i>under $4 a share.</i>

26:28.263 --> 26:30.230
<i>And judging from</i>
<i>the selling,</i>

26:30.265 --> 26:33.033
<i>there doesn't appear to be</i>
<i>a bottom in sight.</i>

26:35.804 --> 26:37.772
So Blankfein
has a speech

26:37.807 --> 26:39.841
he's trying to get out of,
but the rest have confirmed.

26:39.876 --> 26:42.310
- Tell him it's not optional.
- Yeah.

26:42.345 --> 26:44.812
Good afternoon, Chairman.
Thank you so much for joining us.

26:44.846 --> 26:46.246
Whose plane is this?

26:46.281 --> 26:48.214
Uh, that's a rental.

26:48.249 --> 26:50.684
Hank put it
on his card.

26:50.718 --> 26:53.586
Sir, you know Neel and
Michele Davis, public affairs.

26:53.621 --> 26:54.854
Hi. Pleasure.

26:54.889 --> 26:56.556
This is Dan Jester--
our new numbers guy.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.542
Hi.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.091
I've talked him into
coming out of retirement.

26:59.093 --> 27:01.561
- Excuse me? Retirement?
- He was with us at Goldman.

27:01.596 --> 27:03.929
Got anybody at Treasury
who wasn't at Goldman?

27:03.963 --> 27:05.763
Chairman,
just to be clear,

27:05.797 --> 27:07.831
there's no question of
conflict of interest.

27:07.866 --> 27:10.467
Hank sold all of his Goldman stock
before he took office.

27:10.501 --> 27:12.201
I wasn't implying
anything.

27:12.236 --> 27:13.970
Sorry.
We're a little touchy

27:14.004 --> 27:16.672
about the whole
government-Sachs thing.

27:16.706 --> 27:18.473
Shall we?

27:21.610 --> 27:24.144
B of A keeps finding
more toxic assets.

27:24.179 --> 27:26.179
They want you
to reconsider a Jamie deal.

27:26.214 --> 27:28.081
They'll split the first
billion in losses,

27:28.115 --> 27:30.015
but they want you on the hook
for the next 40.

27:30.050 --> 27:32.250
You did it for Bear.

27:32.285 --> 27:34.552
Greg, let me
get back to you.

27:34.586 --> 27:37.021
What do I have to--
tattoo it on my forehead?

27:37.055 --> 27:38.688
We are not
bailing out Lehman.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.356
Wall Street has
a gambling problem.

27:40.391 --> 27:42.392
If government keeps
covering their losses,

27:42.426 --> 27:44.494
they never learn
anything.

27:45.395 --> 27:47.062
What?

27:47.097 --> 27:49.831
I didn't know if you wanted
to keep lecturing me on moral hazard

27:49.866 --> 27:52.567
or if I should just
call B of A back.

27:52.601 --> 27:54.670
We need to keep them at the table

27:54.704 --> 27:56.839
until they come up with
a private-sector solution.

27:56.873 --> 27:59.341
Tell them
to stay with us.

27:59.375 --> 28:01.543
- Alistair, hello.
- <i>Hello, Henry.</i>

28:01.578 --> 28:03.679
Hold on one second.

28:04.881 --> 28:06.849
Chancellor of
the Exchequer.

28:06.883 --> 28:10.253
<i>I understand Barclays is one of</i>
<i>your potential buyers for Lehman.</i>

28:10.287 --> 28:13.156
<i>My banks are already under</i>
<i>a great deal of stress.</i>

28:13.190 --> 28:15.458
<i>They don't want</i>
<i>to become overextended.</i>

28:15.492 --> 28:17.726
Lehman is problematic,
but there's value there.

28:17.761 --> 28:20.029
We will find a way
to make it attractive.

28:20.063 --> 28:22.230
Just stay with us.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.865
<i>Talk soon.</i>

28:23.899 --> 28:25.299
Bye.

28:25.334 --> 28:27.301
We'll keep Barclays
in the mix,

28:27.336 --> 28:30.137
but B of A is still
our best bet.

28:30.172 --> 28:33.575
We've got the C.E.O.s of every
major bank coming here tonight.

28:33.609 --> 28:36.944
We have to make it clear
that this their problem,

28:36.979 --> 28:40.347
that we are their advisors
and their allies,

28:40.381 --> 28:44.417
but we are not
their safety net.

28:45.719 --> 28:47.386
What should we expect
from these guys?

28:58.065 --> 29:00.032
<i>Jamie is smart.</i>

29:00.067 --> 29:02.134
<i>He doesn't have as much</i>
<i>cash to work with</i>

29:02.169 --> 29:04.836
<i>since he bought Bear.</i>

29:04.871 --> 29:07.638
<i>Lloyd's a superstar.</i>

29:07.673 --> 29:10.408
<i>Goldman's the smartest</i>
<i>shop on the block.</i>

29:10.442 --> 29:12.410
<i>And just because</i>
<i>I used to be his boss,</i>

29:12.445 --> 29:15.914
<i>it doesn't mean</i>
<i>he's gonna listen to me.</i>

29:15.948 --> 29:18.817
<i>John Mack used to run</i>
<i>around the floor screaming,</i>

29:18.851 --> 29:22.587
<i>"there's blood in the water!</i>
<i>Let's go kill someone!"</i>

29:22.621 --> 29:25.156
<i>He's a fighter.</i>

29:26.957 --> 29:28.791
<i>Thain was my number two</i>
<i>at Goldman.</i>

29:28.825 --> 29:30.792
<i>He's selfish.</i>
<i>He's a pragmatist.</i>

29:30.826 --> 29:34.628
<i>He knows-- if Lehman goes,</i>
<i>Merrill's next.</i>

29:35.931 --> 29:39.333
<i>Vikram Pandit is the new guy</i>
<i>at Citigroup.</i>

29:39.368 --> 29:42.103
<i>No one knows</i>
<i>if he's running Citi</i>

29:42.137 --> 29:44.338
<i>or if Citi's</i>
<i>running him.</i>

30:07.223 --> 30:11.359
Thanks for coming down here
on such short notice.

30:11.393 --> 30:13.428
Monday morning Lehman
will no longer be able

30:13.462 --> 30:15.597
to honor
its obligations.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.035
<i>We have two potential buyers--</i>
<i>B of A and Barclays.</i>

30:21.070 --> 30:23.337
Neither will take the company
unless someone else

30:23.372 --> 30:25.639
finances part of the deal.

30:25.674 --> 30:29.143
The government is not
in a position to step in.

30:30.479 --> 30:33.447
I did the last one.
You're gonna do this one.

30:33.481 --> 30:34.848
Where is Dick Fuld?

30:34.882 --> 30:37.116
Dick's in no condition
to make any decisions.

30:37.150 --> 30:40.286
<i>We're breaking you</i>
<i>into three groups.</i>

30:40.320 --> 30:43.123
The first one
will try to value

30:43.157 --> 30:45.059
Lehman's toxic assets.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.128
<i>The second one will work</i>
<i>on some sort of structure</i>

30:47.162 --> 30:49.330
<i>for you all to invest</i>
<i>in Lehman.</i>

30:49.365 --> 30:53.035
And the third one works
on the lights-out plan.

30:53.070 --> 30:55.471
If Lehman files for bankruptcy,
we need to figure out

30:55.506 --> 30:57.774
how to contain the damage
to the rest of you.

30:57.808 --> 30:58.975
Christ.

30:59.010 --> 31:00.945
We've all seen
this coming for miles.

31:00.979 --> 31:04.150
I don't think the Lehman bankruptcy
takes down our firms.

31:04.184 --> 31:06.787
What, are we
crossing our fingers?

31:06.822 --> 31:09.457
You're asking us
to save a competitor.

31:09.491 --> 31:11.927
Let's not act like you're
doing us a favor.

31:11.961 --> 31:16.131
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you are great Americans

31:16.165 --> 31:18.099
undertaking
a patriotic duty.

31:18.133 --> 31:20.867
<i>Your travail</i>
<i>will earn you</i>

31:20.901 --> 31:24.335
<i>the love and gratitude</i>
<i>of your country.</i>

31:24.370 --> 31:26.604
I think it was Thomas Paine
who said that these are--

31:26.638 --> 31:28.805
Lehman is a trading partner
for every bank in this room.

31:28.839 --> 31:31.606
<i>And their failure will be a</i>
<i>massive blow to all of you.</i>

31:31.641 --> 31:33.341
<i>This is</i>
<i>your problem.</i>

31:33.375 --> 31:35.809
We can all argue about
how we got here--

31:35.843 --> 31:38.144
deregulation,
derivatives,

31:38.178 --> 31:39.912
Dick Fuld made
bad decisions.

31:39.946 --> 31:43.547
<i>We're all responsible.</i>
<i>It's a catastrophic mess.</i>

31:43.582 --> 31:45.949
<i>The government's done</i>
<i>whatever it can do.</i>

31:45.983 --> 31:47.317
<i>It's on you now.</i>

31:47.351 --> 31:50.286
<i>You need to fix it</i>
<i>and you need to pay for it.</i>

31:50.320 --> 31:53.756
Let me be clear:

31:53.790 --> 31:55.757
We will remember

31:55.792 --> 31:58.460
anyone who's not helpful.

32:21.416 --> 32:23.818
<i>Do you notice a little</i>
<i>pattern here?</i>

32:23.852 --> 32:26.620
<i>We don't deal with things until there's</i>
<i>some kind of emergency on the table.</i>

32:26.655 --> 32:28.923
<i>Yeah, we don't deal</i>
<i>with things until Friday--</i>

32:28.957 --> 32:31.292
<i>Some kind of a weekend thing.</i>
<i>When are we gonna figure out</i>

32:31.326 --> 32:33.494
<i>exactly how to handle the failure</i>
<i>of an investment bank?</i>

32:33.529 --> 32:35.063
<i>Well, let's do it</i>
<i>over a weekend.</i>

32:35.097 --> 32:37.098
Just I talked to a person
who is monitoring

32:37.132 --> 32:39.434
The situation out there,
and the person said

32:39.468 --> 32:42.771
they all want the same deal
Jamie Dimon got,

32:42.805 --> 32:44.806
and they're not
going to get it.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.241
Just a heads up--
Chris Flowers is in the lobby.

32:47.276 --> 32:50.178
He's consulting
for B of A on Lehman.

32:52.047 --> 32:54.849
Hank pushed Flowers
out of Goldman.

32:54.883 --> 32:56.617
Yesterday we thought
Lehman was holding

32:56.652 --> 32:58.552
$30 billion in crap.
Today it's $70--

32:58.587 --> 33:02.054
$70 billion in assets that
we're valuing with a dartboard.

33:02.088 --> 33:03.422
No, we're gonna
work this out.

33:03.457 --> 33:05.725
Unless you step in,
we're ending this.

33:05.759 --> 33:07.159
Don't forget
about Dick.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.960
Yeah, Dick Fuld
keeps calling,

33:08.994 --> 33:10.761
hammering us
to raise the price.

33:12.531 --> 33:14.531
Excuse me.

33:19.037 --> 33:21.904
$70 fucking billion

33:21.939 --> 33:25.574
and no collateral?

33:25.609 --> 33:28.143
<i>If Lehman Brothers fails</i>
<i>this weekend,</i>

33:28.178 --> 33:30.445
there's little doubt
amongst the people I speak to

33:30.480 --> 33:32.547
that Merrill Lynch
will be next.

33:32.581 --> 33:34.884
Confidence is a very
fragile thing.

33:34.918 --> 33:38.587
And in our financial markets
it is eroding very quickly.

33:38.622 --> 33:40.822
Lehman's not gonna
make it.

33:40.856 --> 33:43.824
We're next.
We need to do something right now.

33:43.858 --> 33:46.093
B of A's the only one
out there.

33:46.127 --> 33:48.529
I can put in a call.
It screws Lehman, but--

33:48.563 --> 33:51.431
Lehman screwed themselves.
Paulson has drawn a line in the sand.

33:51.465 --> 33:53.366
Lehman is dead.

33:53.400 --> 33:55.634
Make the call.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.641
We'd like you guys
to look at taking a stake in Merrill,

34:01.675 --> 34:04.677
something in
the neighborhood of 10%.

34:04.711 --> 34:08.112
Well, I don't know
if I can generate any interest in 10%,

34:08.147 --> 34:11.215
but if the whole
company's in play,

34:11.250 --> 34:14.485
I bet that's something
that we'd consider.

34:14.518 --> 34:16.587
Us <i>and</i> Lehman?

34:16.621 --> 34:19.589
Deal of this size--
there's only room for one.

34:26.228 --> 34:28.396
It is a lot of risk,
no question,

34:28.431 --> 34:30.398
but if you stay
in the game,

34:30.433 --> 34:32.766
we all will find
a private solution.

34:32.801 --> 34:34.668
Absolutely.

34:35.837 --> 34:37.804
Don't get scared
by the numbers.

34:37.839 --> 34:40.341
We'll figure it out.
Lehman is worth owning.

34:40.375 --> 34:43.074
Guys, you got a second?

34:46.478 --> 34:48.446
I was at A.I.G.
yesterday.

34:48.481 --> 34:50.447
Next Wednesday
they got

34:50.482 --> 34:53.349
a $5 billion hole,
minimum.

34:53.382 --> 34:55.849
I called
Warren Buffett.

34:55.884 --> 34:58.818
He wouldn't touch it
with a stick.

34:58.852 --> 35:00.653
We're looking
into it.

35:00.687 --> 35:02.788
It's a very big company.

35:05.157 --> 35:07.091
Thanks, Chris.

35:07.125 --> 35:09.259
I appreciate
all your help.

35:15.667 --> 35:18.469
They're not
on top of it.

35:24.511 --> 35:26.613
Look at this.

35:30.452 --> 35:32.988
Is this even possible?

35:33.022 --> 35:34.890
A.I.G.?

35:34.924 --> 35:36.392
Holy shit.

35:37.828 --> 35:39.929
Get into this.

35:41.899 --> 35:44.502
John.

35:48.307 --> 35:51.577
Do you see
what's happening here?

35:51.611 --> 35:53.746
Are you watching out
for yourself?

35:53.780 --> 35:55.714
I'm not thick.

35:55.748 --> 35:58.483
I'm working
on something.

36:01.721 --> 36:04.856
You're talking
to B of A.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.126
I'm sorry.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.960
I know it's not good
for Lehman,

36:09.994 --> 36:11.528
but I have to take care
of Merrill.

36:11.562 --> 36:14.964
Let me worry
about Lehman.

36:14.998 --> 36:17.700
Barclays is still
in the game.

36:19.369 --> 36:21.370
Just get it done.

36:32.448 --> 36:36.118
B of A is gonna
buy Merrill.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.355
We need to make
Barclays work.

36:40.389 --> 36:43.892
I thought you said
the British never close.

36:43.927 --> 36:45.861
They're here.

36:45.895 --> 36:48.230
They seem to really
want it.

36:48.264 --> 36:51.733
If we hold their hands,
they'll close.

36:51.768 --> 36:53.868
Rodgin,
what the fuck?

36:53.903 --> 36:57.004
I can't get Geithner.
I can't get Paulson.

36:57.039 --> 37:00.142
I can't even get my own goddamn
employees to pick up the phone.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.211
There's a lot happening
down here, Dick.

37:02.245 --> 37:03.679
Oh fuck.

37:03.713 --> 37:06.181
You know what?
You tell Geithner,

37:06.216 --> 37:09.518
he doesn't pull my ass out of the fire--
Merrill's gonna be next.

37:09.553 --> 37:12.788
He knows that.
Dick, he just told me

37:12.823 --> 37:15.391
they're working
on a solution for Merrill.

37:18.228 --> 37:20.729
Those cocksuckers are
gonna bail out Merrill?

37:20.764 --> 37:22.365
No no, not the Fed.

37:22.399 --> 37:24.367
Well, there's no
private buyers.

37:24.401 --> 37:27.403
There's just B of A
and--

37:27.438 --> 37:30.039
they're gonna put B of A
together with Merrill?

37:30.073 --> 37:32.607
We still have Barclays.
Hank feels that--

37:32.642 --> 37:36.944
the federal government
is snaking my deal?

37:36.978 --> 37:40.614
I cannot fucking
believe this shit!

37:42.451 --> 37:44.720
B of A made a deal
with Merrill?

37:44.754 --> 37:46.789
Yeah, Lehman's still
our problem.

37:46.823 --> 37:49.158
I don't think I can take
another day of this.

37:49.192 --> 37:51.160
You're getting out
of a Mercedes

37:51.195 --> 37:53.196
to go to the New York
Federal Reserve.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.532
It's not a Higgins boat
on Omaha Beach.

38:03.774 --> 38:05.709
Okay okay,

38:05.743 --> 38:07.710
we've been here
a long time.

38:07.745 --> 38:10.146
Let's stop
fucking around.

38:10.180 --> 38:13.382
Main Street wants
Wall Street to pay.

38:13.417 --> 38:16.519
They think we're
overpaid assholes.

38:16.553 --> 38:20.056
There's no politician
who's gonna sign off on a bailout.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.058
Why would you
bail out people

38:22.092 --> 38:24.059
whose sole job
is to make money?

38:24.094 --> 38:28.530
So let's make this
real simple.

38:28.564 --> 38:31.299
Hank thinks
he can sell

38:31.333 --> 38:33.067
the good parts of Lehman
to Barclays,

38:33.102 --> 38:35.069
but someone has to take
the real estate crap

38:35.103 --> 38:37.471
that's weighing down
the company.

38:37.505 --> 38:39.472
Nobody knows how much
this shit is worth,

38:39.507 --> 38:41.541
but we know somebody has to
buy it to make a deal.

38:41.575 --> 38:43.576
I don't like it.

38:43.610 --> 38:46.045
Nobody likes it.

38:46.079 --> 38:48.881
Let's just suck it up
and do it.

38:48.915 --> 38:51.350
How many of you can
kick in a billion dollars

38:51.385 --> 38:53.987
to stop Lehman
from going down?

38:56.891 --> 38:58.925
I'm in.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.728
One billion.

39:12.139 --> 39:14.307
<i>Okay.</i>

39:20.079 --> 39:22.381
Goldman's
in for a billion.

39:29.723 --> 39:32.191
John?

39:32.226 --> 39:34.360
Yeah.

39:39.933 --> 39:42.034
Yes.

39:43.537 --> 39:45.738
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:47.140 --> 39:49.273
<i>Yes.</i>

39:53.912 --> 39:56.514
We did it.
Barclays came through.

39:56.548 --> 39:58.416
Too goddamn right!

39:58.450 --> 40:00.851
Barclays won't touch
the real estate assets,

40:00.886 --> 40:03.220
but the other banks
agreed to cover those.

40:04.756 --> 40:07.091
Call the board.
Get everybody here.

40:07.125 --> 40:08.993
We got a deal to make.

40:09.028 --> 40:10.495
Okay.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.608
<i>Did you get him?</i>

40:21.642 --> 40:24.510
Geithner doesn't
return my calls.

40:24.544 --> 40:26.344
We can't get hold of
any of those people.

40:26.378 --> 40:29.279
At the end of the day they can't
sign the deal without our say-so.

40:29.314 --> 40:31.915
Yes, but do they
know that?

40:35.319 --> 40:37.286
Yes.

40:37.321 --> 40:38.921
Yes, by all means,

40:38.955 --> 40:41.290
now that he deigns to call,
put him through.

40:41.324 --> 40:44.492
Sir Callum, sorry I haven't
gotten back to you.

40:44.527 --> 40:46.327
We're just
sorting through

40:46.362 --> 40:48.963
this Barclays deal
for Lehman.

40:48.997 --> 40:51.165
As Barclays' regulator,

40:51.199 --> 40:54.167
we have serious concerns
about this proposed arrangement.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.002
What-- are--
are you saying

40:56.037 --> 40:58.104
you won't approve
the deal?

40:58.138 --> 41:00.239
Even if we were
comfortable with the agreement,

41:00.273 --> 41:01.807
which we are not,

41:01.841 --> 41:03.809
Barclays would need
at least 30 days

41:03.843 --> 41:05.777
for shareholder
approval.

41:05.811 --> 41:08.179
No no no no no no.

41:08.214 --> 41:10.548
He can't.
He can't do this.

41:10.583 --> 41:13.284
- Can they stop the deal?
- Of course they can stop the deal.

41:13.319 --> 41:15.286
But even if they don't stop it,
the delay will kill it.

41:15.321 --> 41:18.789
Let's call the Chancellor
of the Exchequer right now.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.958
None of those
assets

41:20.992 --> 41:23.461
would be part
of Barclays.

41:24.830 --> 41:28.867
Yes, but if the F.S.A.
were to--

41:30.503 --> 41:35.173
of c--
of course.

41:36.342 --> 41:38.310
Yeah.

41:38.344 --> 41:40.712
<i>I wish you good night.</i>

41:42.048 --> 41:44.248
Good night to you too.

41:51.622 --> 41:54.557
"We don't want to import
your cancer."

42:06.303 --> 42:09.473
Those of you

42:09.507 --> 42:12.677
who didn't want to assist
the Barclays deal,

42:12.711 --> 42:15.979
you can breathe
a sigh of relief.

42:16.014 --> 42:18.048
The deal's not
gonna happen.

42:18.082 --> 42:20.450
- Hank, we have the money.
- The deal's dead.

42:20.485 --> 42:23.754
The British regulator
won't sign off.

42:23.788 --> 42:25.422
There must be some
pressure you can exert.

42:25.456 --> 42:28.059
Trust me, I've done
everything I can.

42:28.093 --> 42:31.562
The British--

42:31.597 --> 42:34.465
they grin-fucked us.

42:37.103 --> 42:39.037
Pason's got
100,000 employees.

42:39.071 --> 42:41.039
Geithner has
200 lawyers.

42:41.073 --> 42:43.074
Freaking Chris Cox
has 3000 people.

42:43.109 --> 42:46.144
Not a single one of those assholes
could pick up a phone,

42:46.169 --> 42:48.669
call the British, find out if
they're was a deal to be made

42:48.748 --> 42:51.817
before they spend the weekend was
sweating us for cash?

42:51.851 --> 42:53.819
Somebody dropped
the ball.

42:53.853 --> 42:55.754
They didn't
drop the ball.

42:55.788 --> 42:57.823
They dropped the ball,
kicked the coach in the nuts

42:57.857 --> 42:59.791
and took a crap in
the quarterback's mouth.

42:59.826 --> 43:01.927
Of course.

43:03.462 --> 43:06.031
The Fed will do
something.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.000
They have to.

43:13.740 --> 43:15.707
We've got to announce
the Lehman bankruptcy now.

43:15.742 --> 43:17.709
If Asia opens and
this isn't locked down,

43:17.744 --> 43:19.578
everyone's gonna
assume the worst.

43:19.612 --> 43:21.747
The selloff will kill
the Merrill-B of A deal.

43:21.781 --> 43:24.216
- Who's gonna make the announcement?
- I think it's gotta be S.E.C.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.617
Yeah.

43:25.651 --> 43:28.019
Okay.

43:30.889 --> 43:33.958
Let's do it here.
How soon can we set that up?

43:33.992 --> 43:35.426
Right away.

43:35.461 --> 43:38.095
We could use the main floor,
the entrance hall.

43:38.130 --> 43:40.831
With the statue behind me?
Excellent.

43:44.869 --> 43:47.604
Did Lehman actually
agree to file?

43:56.047 --> 43:57.915
Chris, call Lehman.

43:57.949 --> 43:59.583
Make sure they file
right now.

43:59.617 --> 44:01.451
Absolutely.

44:13.264 --> 44:15.532
A.I.G.'s a huge problem.

44:15.566 --> 44:17.967
The books are a mess.
But from what I can tell,

44:18.002 --> 44:21.036
half the banks in the world
are in bed with these guys.

44:21.071 --> 44:23.406
Everyone who had a
piece-of-crap mortgage security

44:23.440 --> 44:25.542
bought insurance
on their risk from A.I.G.,

44:25.576 --> 44:26.977
and I mean everyone.

44:27.011 --> 44:29.512
How could they
let this happen?

44:29.547 --> 44:33.483
They must have figured
real estate would never go down, ever.

44:33.517 --> 44:36.386
Hank, Lehman still
hasn't filed.

44:38.422 --> 44:41.390
Cox has to make his announcement.
Asia's opening.

44:41.425 --> 44:43.726
Has he talked to them?

44:43.760 --> 44:46.162
He hasn't even
called yet.

44:46.196 --> 44:48.732
We told Fuld about Barclays.
We said Cox was gonna call.

44:48.766 --> 44:50.700
He's got his entire board
sitting there--

44:50.734 --> 44:52.568
no call.

44:52.603 --> 44:54.537
Cox is like a deer
in the headlights.

44:54.571 --> 44:56.673
Son of a bitch!

45:02.546 --> 45:06.249
You are their regulator.
Call the Lehman board now.

45:06.283 --> 45:09.118
Hank, this is a complicated
situation where--

45:09.152 --> 45:11.020
Asia's opening.

45:11.054 --> 45:12.822
They don't announce--
market goes in the toilet.

45:12.856 --> 45:15.891
We have to consider the
appropriate role of government here.

45:15.926 --> 45:18.360
Can I as chairman of S.E.C.
move forward and--?

45:18.395 --> 45:20.863
You guys are like the gang
that can't shoot straight.

45:20.897 --> 45:23.198
This is your job.

45:23.233 --> 45:26.668
Make the damn
phone call.

45:33.576 --> 45:35.677
Chris, this is
Dick Fuld.

45:35.712 --> 45:37.746
The board is in session.
Everyone is here--

45:37.780 --> 45:40.382
all the directors
and the firm's counsel.

45:40.416 --> 45:42.184
We understand

45:42.218 --> 45:44.686
the Barclays deal
has imploded.

45:44.721 --> 45:48.957
We were hoping you might
have some option

45:48.992 --> 45:51.493
that we haven't
thought of yet.

45:51.527 --> 45:54.896
Uh, the markets are
in turmoil, as you know.

45:54.931 --> 45:57.566
<i>A Lehman bankruptcy</i>
<i>will help</i>

45:57.600 --> 46:00.401
settle that uncertainty
and, we believe, calm the market.

46:00.436 --> 46:03.238
<i>Both the Fed and SEC</i>
<i>are in agreement about this.</i>

46:03.272 --> 46:04.934
Well, let me under--

46:04.959 --> 46:06.439
I'm sorry, let me see
if I understand this.

46:06.441 --> 46:08.675
Are-- are you
directing us

46:08.710 --> 46:11.244
to put Lehman
into bankruptcy?

46:11.279 --> 46:13.013
Give us a moment.

46:14.282 --> 46:16.050
- He's muted.
- What the hell was that?

46:19.187 --> 46:21.422
Tell them to file.

46:21.456 --> 46:24.558
Everything said in that meeting
is or will be public record.

46:24.593 --> 46:26.927
I can't tell a private company
to file for bankruptcy.

46:26.961 --> 46:28.628
I don't have
that power.

46:28.663 --> 46:31.097
Do I?

46:33.634 --> 46:35.735
Do it.

46:47.481 --> 46:50.850
The decision to file
for bankruptcy protection

46:50.884 --> 46:53.919
is one the board
needs to make.

46:53.954 --> 46:56.622
It is not the government's
decision.

46:56.656 --> 46:59.325
But we do believe...

47:01.328 --> 47:03.295
That the situation
should be resolved.

47:03.330 --> 47:05.831
So you're not
directing us to file?

47:05.866 --> 47:08.134
I'm not saying anything more
than I've just said.

47:08.168 --> 47:09.769
Thank you.

47:23.149 --> 47:25.450
Take the vote.

47:26.919 --> 47:29.020
- Mr. Akers.
- Yes.

47:29.055 --> 47:32.290
Sir Christopher.

47:32.325 --> 47:33.458
Yes.

47:33.492 --> 47:35.727
Admiral Evans.

47:35.761 --> 47:39.097
<i>I'm sorry, but yes.</i>

47:39.131 --> 47:41.466
Chairman Fuld.

47:43.670 --> 47:45.771
Dick?

47:51.211 --> 47:53.645
Yes.

47:55.782 --> 47:57.883
<i>Mr. Hernandez.</i>

47:57.917 --> 48:00.419
<i>Yes.</i>

48:00.453 --> 48:02.588
<i>Mr. Ainslie.</i>

48:02.622 --> 48:04.390
<i>Yes.</i>

48:04.424 --> 48:07.426
- <i>Mr. Berlind.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

48:07.461 --> 48:09.928
- <i>Mr. Cruikshank.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

48:09.963 --> 48:12.898
- <i>Dr. Kaufman.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

48:12.932 --> 48:16.468
<i>Mr. Macomber.</i>

48:17.737 --> 48:19.471
P?

48:19.505 --> 48:22.974
- Lehman's gone.
- Oh honey.

48:23.008 --> 48:24.976
I should have know the British
were gonna be a problem.

48:25.010 --> 48:27.545
I spoke to them two days ago.
I should have read between the lines.

48:30.549 --> 48:32.984
You can't
take all this on.

48:33.018 --> 48:36.020
There's a lot of
other people involved.

48:36.055 --> 48:38.857
It's on me.
I'm Treasury Secretary

48:38.891 --> 48:41.293
and the fourth largest
investment bank in the country

48:41.327 --> 48:44.028
failed on my watch.

48:44.063 --> 48:47.798
I mean, I-- I--

48:47.833 --> 48:50.701
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

48:52.838 --> 48:55.105
Miss you too.

49:40.284 --> 49:42.618
Taxi.

49:56.034 --> 49:58.603
Jim, I'm at Midtown.

49:58.637 --> 50:01.973
The ticker is--

50:02.008 --> 50:04.310
what the hell
am I looking at?

50:04.344 --> 50:06.679
<i>Hank, it's good.</i>

50:11.552 --> 50:13.654
"It is oddly reassuring

50:13.689 --> 50:16.557
that the Treasury Department
and the Federal Reserve

50:16.592 --> 50:18.126
let Lehman Brothers fail."

50:18.161 --> 50:20.129
Oh, okay, here it is.
Here it is.

50:20.163 --> 50:22.498
Government intervention
would have been seen

50:22.532 --> 50:24.300
a sign of extreme peril

50:24.335 --> 50:26.336
in the global
financial system

50:26.370 --> 50:29.307
or extreme weakness
on the part of federal regulators."

50:29.341 --> 50:31.509
"The New York"
fucking "Times."

50:31.543 --> 50:34.479
Yeah, and it's not just them.
It's everybody.

50:34.513 --> 50:38.149
Thank you, Senator.
I appreciate it.

50:38.184 --> 50:40.585
Congress is liking it.

50:40.620 --> 50:42.787
I'm not sure they should be
so happy about this,

50:42.822 --> 50:45.857
but they like
that we let Lehman go.

50:45.891 --> 50:49.060
You stood strong.
You've got brass balls.

50:49.094 --> 50:51.195
It's what people need
at a time like this.

50:51.230 --> 50:53.330
What is
the market doing?

50:53.365 --> 50:55.065
Uh, Europe's only down
a little.

50:55.099 --> 50:56.966
Dow Jones futures
only off 3%.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.200
So you need to build on this
at the press conference.

50:59.234 --> 51:02.402
The story is we did everything
we could for Lehman.

51:02.436 --> 51:04.136
- We did.
- And the takeaway is...

51:04.171 --> 51:06.871
No more bailouts.

51:06.906 --> 51:08.540
Mr. Secretary.

51:08.574 --> 51:10.441
How should we read
what happened with Lehman?

51:10.475 --> 51:12.476
Read it as
I think it's important

51:12.510 --> 51:14.944
to maintain
the stability

51:14.978 --> 51:18.614
and orderliness
of our financial system;

51:18.648 --> 51:23.719
<i>and, um, the...</i>

51:23.754 --> 51:27.089
Moral hazard is something
I don't take lightly.

51:27.124 --> 51:29.191
Mr. Paulson.
Mr. Secretary, sir.

51:29.225 --> 51:32.561
<i>How do you see the health</i>
<i>of the banking system today?</i>

51:32.596 --> 51:34.597
The way the markets
are performing today--

51:34.631 --> 51:37.700
it's a testament to how the
financial industry has come together

51:37.735 --> 51:39.836
in an extraordinary set
of circumstances.

51:39.870 --> 51:41.838
The American people
can remain confident

51:41.872 --> 51:44.240
in the soundness
and the resilience

51:44.275 --> 51:46.542
of the financial
system.

51:46.577 --> 51:48.111
Thank you all.

51:48.145 --> 51:50.847
Mr. Secretary.
Mr. Paulson.

51:50.881 --> 51:53.016
What?

51:53.050 --> 51:55.818
Dow's falling off a cliff--
400 points already.

51:55.853 --> 51:57.920
And the credit markets
are frozen.

51:57.954 --> 52:00.789
Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are getting slammed by withdrawals.

52:00.823 --> 52:02.991
The Lehman thing's
killing them.

52:04.427 --> 52:06.261
I should talk
to the President

52:06.296 --> 52:08.863
about how we'll contain
the damage.

52:08.898 --> 52:11.366
Before you speak
to the President,

52:11.400 --> 52:13.568
we've had
another problem.

52:14.936 --> 52:16.570
A.I.G.

52:16.604 --> 52:19.105
Mr. Geithner is
working with A.I.G.

52:19.140 --> 52:20.940
on a private-sector
solution

52:20.975 --> 52:22.943
and the Secretary
is monitoring

52:22.977 --> 52:24.878
their progress
very carefully.

52:24.913 --> 52:29.517
He's in close contact with the
Congressional leadership, most--

52:29.551 --> 52:31.386
the White House wants
a briefing on A.I.G.

52:31.420 --> 52:33.221
They're more informed
about that than we are.

52:33.256 --> 52:34.889
We've got the same
information they do.

52:34.923 --> 52:37.891
No, we don't believe
that Lehman's bankruptcy

52:37.926 --> 52:39.927
is taking down
all of Wall Street.

52:39.961 --> 52:41.796
<i>Okay, so how do you explain--?</i>

52:41.830 --> 52:43.798
The A.I.G. situation
may have been,

52:43.833 --> 52:46.568
you know,
exacerbated by the--

52:46.603 --> 52:48.570
and Barney Frank's
office.

52:49.806 --> 52:51.039
Yeah.

52:51.074 --> 52:54.409
A surprise?
No, A.I.G. has been struggling--

52:54.444 --> 52:57.479
<i>Well, why didn't you guys head</i>
<i>off this situation six months ago?</i>

52:57.513 --> 53:01.281
Because the requisite
magic wand wasn't available, Doug.

53:01.315 --> 53:03.082
But if we do find one,

53:03.116 --> 53:05.550
you will be among
the very first to know.

53:06.452 --> 53:08.786
Blankfein on four,
urgent.

53:08.820 --> 53:11.255
I have to go.

53:11.289 --> 53:12.823
Hey Lloyd.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.158
The goddamn British
bankruptcy administrator

53:15.192 --> 53:17.461
froze all of Lehman's
customer accounts.

53:17.495 --> 53:20.098
You didn't square this with
the British before you did it?

53:20.133 --> 53:21.733
<i>Geithner on five.</i>

53:21.768 --> 53:23.468
People are freaking out.

53:23.503 --> 53:25.504
They can't get
their money.

53:25.538 --> 53:27.873
Not investors--
clients.

53:27.907 --> 53:30.509
If customers think their money
wasn't safe with Lehman,

53:30.543 --> 53:32.344
they're not gonna
trust us either.

53:32.378 --> 53:35.613
No one will do
business with us.

53:35.647 --> 53:37.346
You're gonna have
to hang on.

53:37.381 --> 53:38.779
Tim.

53:38.813 --> 53:41.247
Dan spoke to Moody's.
They're downgrading A.I.G. tonight.

53:41.282 --> 53:44.715
Would have happened anyway, but Lehman
put the whole thing into hyperdrive.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.317
How far down
are they?

53:46.351 --> 53:47.985
<i>French finance minster</i>
<i>on six.</i>

53:48.019 --> 53:50.253
They don't know.

53:50.287 --> 53:52.921
We're working on that.

53:52.956 --> 53:54.789
Christine.

53:54.823 --> 53:56.657
How could you let this
happen with Lehman?

53:56.691 --> 53:58.291
What on earth
were you thinking?

53:58.326 --> 54:01.126
We did everything
we could, Christine.

54:01.161 --> 54:03.361
You allowed it
to fail, Hank.

54:03.396 --> 54:05.162
It was a horrifying
mistake.

54:05.197 --> 54:07.864
It is having catastrophic
consequences all over Europe.

54:07.898 --> 54:10.065
And A.I.G. would be
even worse.

54:10.100 --> 54:13.667
The European banks have
tremendous exposure to A.I.G.

54:13.702 --> 54:17.170
We need assurance you will not
fail to act as you did with Lehman.

54:17.204 --> 54:19.905
It is not just
an American problem.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.673
<i>Thank you so much for...</i>

54:22.707 --> 54:23.941
John Mack.

54:23.975 --> 54:25.475
Hey-- uh...

54:25.509 --> 54:27.610
- John.
- Secretary: John-- one.

54:28.778 --> 54:32.014
<i>The fallout from Lehman</i>
<i>is killing us.</i>

54:32.048 --> 54:34.282
The short-sellers
are all over us.

54:34.316 --> 54:35.816
We're down
10% already.

54:35.850 --> 54:38.318
You guys have no idea
what's going on out here.

54:38.352 --> 54:40.820
How are your earnings?

54:40.854 --> 54:43.389
Strong. We're gonna
announce Friday.

54:43.423 --> 54:44.690
Announce now.

54:46.259 --> 54:48.394
Okay, Lloyd, sorry.

54:48.428 --> 54:51.496
Hank, if depositors see they can't
get their assets out of Lehman,

54:51.531 --> 54:53.498
the next step is gonna be
a massive pullout

54:53.533 --> 54:55.668
from all the investment banks.

54:55.702 --> 54:57.303
Jeff Immelt from G.E.

54:58.673 --> 55:01.074
Jesus, what's Immelt
calling you for?

55:01.108 --> 55:02.943
I have to go.

55:02.977 --> 55:04.377
Jeff.

55:04.412 --> 55:06.513
You gotta know
what's going on out here.

55:06.547 --> 55:09.782
We're having trouble funding
our day-to-day operations.

55:09.817 --> 55:13.319
<i>Our finance division is infecting</i>
<i>the rest of our business.</i>

55:13.354 --> 55:15.188
General Electric?

55:15.222 --> 55:18.324
This thing is spreading
way past Wall Street.

55:18.358 --> 55:20.959
I get that nobody wants
to touch mortgages,

55:20.994 --> 55:24.095
but we're making planes
and engines, and light bulbs.

55:24.130 --> 55:26.565
We're a healthy company.

55:26.599 --> 55:29.634
If we can't finance
our day-to-day operations,

55:29.669 --> 55:33.138
every business in America's
gonna be shutting down.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.913
Where's A.I.G.?

55:42.947 --> 55:44.247
It closed at $2.

55:44.282 --> 55:46.683
Tim thinks we need
to do something big.

55:46.717 --> 55:48.118
Ben agrees,
and so do I.

55:48.152 --> 55:50.153
What can we do?
A.I.G.'s not even a bank.

55:50.187 --> 55:52.155
The Fed can lend
to nonbanks

55:52.189 --> 55:54.891
under unusual and
exigent circumstances.

55:54.925 --> 55:58.662
We're thinking of taking over
80% of the company.

56:00.932 --> 56:03.467
Hank, we can't.

56:03.501 --> 56:06.570
This morning we were lecturing
the entire country on moral hazard.

56:06.605 --> 56:09.407
A.I.G. has collateral.
They have assets.

56:09.441 --> 56:12.843
Lehman didn't.
We couldn't lend into a hole.

56:12.878 --> 56:14.646
It's not
the same story.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.614
Nobody's gonna care.

56:16.649 --> 56:19.418
It's another bailout
with no legislation.

56:19.452 --> 56:21.620
The Hill's gonna go crazy.
The country's gonna go crazy.

56:21.654 --> 56:23.655
The plane that we
flew in on this morning--

56:23.689 --> 56:25.623
leased from A.I.G.

56:25.657 --> 56:27.858
Construction downtown--
A.I.G.

56:27.892 --> 56:30.827
Life insurance--
81 million policies

56:30.862 --> 56:33.163
with a face value
of $1.9 trillion,

56:33.198 --> 56:36.467
billions of dollars in teachers' pensions--
it's everywhere.

56:36.501 --> 56:39.069
You want too big to fail?
Here it is.

56:39.103 --> 56:41.071
You got a better idea?

56:41.105 --> 56:43.272
The suggestion box
is wide open.

56:50.013 --> 56:52.581
I hate to do this
right now,

56:52.616 --> 56:54.917
but I'm gonna have to have
a press call first thing,

56:54.952 --> 56:56.986
and I really don't know
what I'm gonna tell them.

56:57.020 --> 56:59.656
Tell them Lehman
exacerbated A.I.G.,

56:59.691 --> 57:02.359
the simultaneous
payouts of C.D.O.s

57:02.394 --> 57:04.996
and credit default swaps
put catastrophic pressure on--

57:05.030 --> 57:08.200
Go back further.

57:08.234 --> 57:10.502
The global pool
of investment capital--

57:10.536 --> 57:12.637
she has to do this
in English.

57:12.671 --> 57:14.772
Start with
the homeowners.

57:14.806 --> 57:17.741
Okay okay, here's how
you explain it.

57:17.775 --> 57:22.311
Wall Street
started bundling

57:22.346 --> 57:24.447
home loans together--
mortgage-backed securities--

57:24.481 --> 57:27.750
<i>and selling slices</i>
<i>of those bundles to investors.</i>

57:27.785 --> 57:30.020
<i>And they were making</i>
<i>big money,</i>

57:30.054 --> 57:32.289
so they started pushing
the lenders, saying,

57:32.323 --> 57:34.358
"come on,
we need more loans.

57:34.392 --> 57:36.361
The lenders had
already given loans

57:36.396 --> 57:38.365
to borrowers
with good credit,

57:38.400 --> 57:40.935
so they go bottom-feeding.
They lower their criteria.

57:40.970 --> 57:43.639
Before, you needed
a credit score of 620

57:43.673 --> 57:45.841
and a downpayment
of 20%.

57:45.876 --> 57:48.377
Now they'll settle for 500,
no money down.

57:48.412 --> 57:50.613
<i>And the buyer--</i>
<i>the regular guy on the street--</i>

57:50.647 --> 57:52.415
assumes that the experts
know what they're doing.

57:52.449 --> 57:55.017
<i>He's saying to himself,</i>
<i>"if the bank's willing to loan me money,</i>

57:55.051 --> 57:56.785
I must be able
to afford it."

57:56.819 --> 57:59.121
So he reaches for
the American dream.

57:59.155 --> 58:00.689
<i>He buys that house.</i>

58:00.723 --> 58:03.925
The banks knew securities based on
shitbag mortgages were risky.

58:03.959 --> 58:05.393
You'll work on "shitbag."

58:05.428 --> 58:06.961
So to control
their downside,

58:06.996 --> 58:08.797
the banks started buying
a kind of insurance.

58:08.831 --> 58:11.933
<i>If mortgages default,</i>
<i>insurance company pays--</i>

58:11.968 --> 58:13.735
default swap.

58:13.769 --> 58:15.904
The banks insure
their potential losses

58:15.938 --> 58:17.706
to move the risk
off their books

58:17.740 --> 58:20.041
so they can invest more,
make more money.

58:20.075 --> 58:22.243
And when a lot of companies
insured this stuff,

58:22.278 --> 58:25.780
one was dumb enough to take on
an almost unbelievable amount of risk.

58:25.814 --> 58:28.249
- A.I.G.
- And you'll work on "dumb."

58:28.283 --> 58:30.484
And when they ask me
why they did that?

58:30.518 --> 58:32.853
- Fees.
- Hundreds of millions in fees.

58:32.887 --> 58:35.456
A.I.G. figured the housing market
would just keep going up,

58:35.490 --> 58:36.924
but then
the unexpected happens.

58:36.958 --> 58:39.093
Housing prices
go down.

58:39.127 --> 58:40.928
<i>The poor bastard who</i>
<i>bought his dream house--</i>

58:40.962 --> 58:43.096
the teaser rate on his
mortgage runs out.

58:43.131 --> 58:45.699
His payments go up.
He defaults.

58:45.733 --> 58:47.501
Mortgage-backed
securities tank.

58:47.535 --> 58:49.469
A.I.G. has to pay off
the swaps--

58:49.504 --> 58:51.738
all of them
all over the world

58:51.773 --> 58:53.774
at the same time.

58:53.808 --> 58:56.910
<i>A.I.G. can't pay.</i>
<i>A.I.G. goes under.</i>

58:56.944 --> 58:59.312
Every bank
they insure

58:59.346 --> 59:03.149
books massive losses
on the same day.

59:03.184 --> 59:05.352
And then they all
go under.

59:05.386 --> 59:07.754
<i>It all comes down.</i>

59:08.756 --> 59:11.257
The whole financial system?

59:16.063 --> 59:18.331
And what do I say

59:18.366 --> 59:21.100
when they ask me
why it wasn't regulated?

59:21.135 --> 59:24.971
No one wanted to.

59:25.005 --> 59:28.341
We were making
too much money.

59:38.219 --> 59:40.153
You'll work on

59:40.187 --> 59:42.789
"we were making
too much money."

59:55.136 --> 59:57.404
Hey, Hank,

59:57.438 --> 59:59.940
um...

59:59.974 --> 01:00:01.975
These are
really mild,

01:00:02.009 --> 01:00:04.110
but they work.

01:00:04.145 --> 01:00:07.246
I know the whole
Christian Scientist thing--

01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:10.484
that you don't
take medicine.

01:00:10.518 --> 01:00:13.186
But you need
to sleep.

01:00:15.223 --> 01:00:16.923
Jim--

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.259
Hank, not just
for your own sake.

01:00:19.293 --> 01:00:21.394
Okay?

01:00:25.466 --> 01:00:27.601
You don't look
so good.

01:00:32.173 --> 01:00:34.708
Just minutes ago
CNN has confirmed

01:00:34.742 --> 01:00:36.977
that the Federal Reserve
is negotiating

01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:39.346
to rescue
insurance giant AIG

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.348
The negotiations
could include

01:00:41.383 --> 01:00:43.818
an $85 billion
temporary loan

01:00:43.852 --> 01:00:46.020
to stave off
AIG's imminent collapse.

01:00:46.055 --> 01:00:47.655
This is a blockbuster,
folks.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:50.157
<i>About this time last night,</i>
<i>many on Wall Street</i>

01:00:50.192 --> 01:00:52.325
<i>were fearing</i>
<i>total disaster today.</i>

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.327
<i>So another</i>
<i>federal bailout</i>

01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:56.228
<i>of another</i>
<i>Wall Street giant--</i>

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.797
<i>again, as we mentioned,</i>
<i>big big financial news.</i>

01:00:58.832 --> 01:01:02.468
<i>And this affects almost everyone</i>
<i>out there who has a 401k.</i>

01:01:02.502 --> 01:01:04.336
<i>The news comes</i>
<i>about 3 1/2 hours</i>

01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:06.705
<i>after the stock exchange</i>
<i>closed on...</i>

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.475
Motherfucker.

01:01:09.509 --> 01:01:11.543
We want to go straight
right now to Ali Velshi

01:01:11.578 --> 01:01:13.712
to kind of give us
a bottom line on this, Ali.

01:01:13.746 --> 01:01:15.881
<i>And then we're gonna get</i>
<i>a lot more in depth...</i>

01:01:15.915 --> 01:01:17.583
AIG securing an 85...

01:01:17.617 --> 01:01:19.584
The credit markets
are still frozen solid.

01:01:19.618 --> 01:01:21.587
We keep dumping money
into these companies

01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:24.823
so the markets
will stabilize,

01:01:24.858 --> 01:01:26.291
and nothing helps.

01:01:26.326 --> 01:01:28.961
We can't keep
doing this.

01:01:28.995 --> 01:01:31.597
We rescued Bear
with no legislation,

01:01:31.631 --> 01:01:35.033
A.I.G. with no legislation.

01:01:35.068 --> 01:01:37.436
People think Fannie and Freddie
was a bait-and-switch.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.037
I don't like it
any more than you do,

01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:40.972
but they were
exceptional situations.

01:01:41.007 --> 01:01:44.009
This situation
demands an endgame

01:01:44.043 --> 01:01:47.278
that does not rely on
unilateral action from the Fed.

01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:48.946
This is a democracy.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.582
We cannot be men behind the
curtain pulling the strings.

01:01:51.617 --> 01:01:53.752
<i>We need some kind of</i>
<i>an overall solution</i>

01:01:53.786 --> 01:01:56.121
<i>that heals</i>
<i>the entire system.</i>

01:01:56.155 --> 01:01:58.323
<i>And it has to be</i>
<i>legitimate.</i>

01:01:58.357 --> 01:01:59.958
We've been putting off
going to Congress.

01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:01.893
It's two months
before an election.

01:02:01.928 --> 01:02:05.096
They can't vote yes
to a massive bailout

01:02:05.131 --> 01:02:06.865
of the entire
banking system.

01:02:06.899 --> 01:02:08.366
They'd never get
reelected.

01:02:08.401 --> 01:02:10.368
- Hank--
- We go to Congress,

01:02:10.402 --> 01:02:12.971
publically state
we don't have the firepower

01:02:13.005 --> 01:02:15.473
to control this
anymore,

01:02:15.507 --> 01:02:17.508
and then they say no--

01:02:17.543 --> 01:02:21.646
that is really
the nightmare scenario.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.250
The nightmare scenario's
already here, my friend.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:29.654
We're in it.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.081
P.

01:03:41.992 --> 01:03:44.026
You can't put this all
on your own shoulders.

01:03:44.061 --> 01:03:45.761
We're running out
of options.

01:03:45.796 --> 01:03:48.331
Then you just
keep trying.

01:03:48.365 --> 01:03:50.466
That's what you do.

01:03:50.501 --> 01:03:52.635
Eventually
something's gonna work.

01:03:52.669 --> 01:03:55.605
I'm not sure that
that is true anymore.

01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:58.174
There's not a bank
in the world

01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:00.176
that has enough money
in its vault

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.677
to pay
its depositors.

01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:04.313
It's all built
on trust.

01:04:04.347 --> 01:04:06.615
And--
and, Wendy, we--

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.219
we are
so very close.

01:04:13.156 --> 01:04:16.892
Morgan Stanley, Goldman
are an inch away.

01:04:16.927 --> 01:04:19.662
If the other banks
stop trusting them,

01:04:19.696 --> 01:04:22.665
if they pull back
on interbank lending,

01:04:22.699 --> 01:04:24.967
it's over
in a matter of hours.

01:04:25.001 --> 01:04:27.502
And from there
it goes

01:04:27.537 --> 01:04:29.504
too fast to stop--
a run--

01:04:29.539 --> 01:04:32.274
and not just
on that one bank.

01:04:32.308 --> 01:04:34.276
I mean,
on the whole system.

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:37.178
And average people
wondering,

01:04:37.213 --> 01:04:39.647
"is my money safe?"

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.582
They start pulling
their cash.

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:46.486
And after that--

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.756
lines outside the banks,
smashed A.T.M.s.

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:53.161
A couple of weeks--

01:04:53.195 --> 01:04:56.164
there's no milk
in the store.

01:04:56.198 --> 01:04:58.066
<i>For the second time</i>
<i>this week</i>

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.901
<i>there was a massive selloff</i>
<i>on Wall Street,</i>

01:04:59.935 --> 01:05:03.504
<i>the Dow Jones Industrials</i>
<i>freefalling some 450 points</i>

01:05:03.539 --> 01:05:05.506

01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:07.442
<i>of the A.I.G.</i>
<i>Insurance company.</i>

<i>Three of the five</i>

01:05:09.878 --> 01:05:12.280
<i>The country's biggest</i>
<i>mortgage lender is gone.</i>

01:05:12.314 --> 01:05:15.050
<i>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</i>
<i>brought under government control.</i>

01:05:15.084 --> 01:05:17.186
<i>The financial system</i>
<i>is holding right now,</i>

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.821
<i>but for how long?</i>

01:05:18.856 --> 01:05:21.491
<i>All the King's horses</i>
<i>and all the King's men</i>

01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:23.927
<i>are being brought to bear</i>

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.683
Hi Tim.

01:05:51.717 --> 01:05:53.651
I'm on the street, Hank,

01:05:53.685 --> 01:05:55.853
and people are just
going about their business.

01:05:55.887 --> 01:05:59.189
They have no idea the whole
thing is about to fall down.

01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:01.757
<i>We're gonna have to</i>
<i>go to Congress.</i>

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:03.359
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>a choice anymore.</i>

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.060
Okay.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:07.095
How fast do you think
you can get them to move?

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:09.297
It's gonna be at least
a couple days.

01:06:09.331 --> 01:06:12.534
Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are going down now.

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.236
We gotta do
something today.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.437
Like what?

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.572
The market doesn't like
investment banks, right?

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:20.008
The money's saying fuck you
to the whole business model.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.543
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:24.646
Yeah, so merge them
with commercial banks,

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:26.782
turn them into regular banks
regulated by the Fed.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.517
They can use
depositors' cash.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.519
It will give them access
to the discount window.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:33.489
It's cheap government cash.

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.392
- You want to make them bigger?
- <i>It's a trade-off, Hank.</i>

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:40.329
The upside is
it'll stabilize them.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.898
The downside is,

01:06:42.933 --> 01:06:46.903
yeah, they'll be
really fucking big.

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:49.139
Do it, Tim.

01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:52.977
Godspeed.

01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:12.901
Get me Blankfein.

01:07:14.403 --> 01:07:16.672
Lloyd, call Vikram Pandit,
talk to him about a merger.

01:07:16.706 --> 01:07:18.708
Tim, we're looking
at all our options.

01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:20.710
You don't have
options, Lloyd.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.212
There's a run
on your bank.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:24.081
You need money--
Citi has deposits.

01:07:24.115 --> 01:07:26.984
Citi is a mess--
you're organized. Call Pandit.

01:07:36.397 --> 01:07:37.738
Yeah.

01:07:37.763 --> 01:07:39.463
I want you to look at merging
with Morgan Stanley.

01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:41.402
What, are you kidding me?
I just bought Bear.

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:43.037
We're still trying
to make that work.

01:07:43.071 --> 01:07:45.173
You didn't buy Bear.
You got Bear as a Christmas present.

01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:47.042
The market's a fucking
disaster, Jamie.

01:07:47.076 --> 01:07:49.211
Talk to John Mack.

01:07:49.245 --> 01:07:51.980
Hey, Geithner says
we should talk about a merger.

01:07:52.015 --> 01:07:54.116
- You want to do a deal?
- No.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:56.285
Then why the fuck did he
tell me to call you?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.521
I'm under orders
to try and help you.

01:07:58.556 --> 01:08:01.959
You're a prince, Jamie--
a real prince.

01:08:05.497 --> 01:08:07.766
Apparently some people
seem to think

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.001
combining our firms
would be a good idea.

01:08:10.036 --> 01:08:12.971
Well, I want you to know
I'm flattered by this call.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.140
Vikram,
I'm not trying

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:17.243
to flatter you,
believe me.

01:08:17.277 --> 01:08:18.844
<i>Geithner's calling.</i>

01:08:18.879 --> 01:08:21.247
Oh, here comes
goddamn eharmony.

01:08:21.281 --> 01:08:23.750
Hey, guess what.
Jaime's not interested.

01:08:25.653 --> 01:08:27.787
Do Wachovia.

01:08:27.823 --> 01:08:29.957
They were writing mortgages
with their eyes closed.

01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:32.158
Tim, it's a shit sandwich.
Forget it.

01:08:37.831 --> 01:08:40.033
Well, I haven't been
able to reach you for four hours.

01:08:40.067 --> 01:08:43.435
That is-- that is totally fucking
unacceptable on a day like today.

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:46.406
I had to run my team
through the Goldman proposal.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:48.073
It's not gonna work.

01:08:48.108 --> 01:08:51.510
You passed on Goldman
without even talking to me?

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:54.712
I don't need another trillion
dollars on my balance sheet.

01:08:58.451 --> 01:09:02.520
Next time I call,
pick up.

01:09:03.423 --> 01:09:05.558
Fucker.

01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:08.694
The problem is the toxic assets.
Let's just buy them.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.962
Ooh, call it
cash-for-trash.

01:09:10.997 --> 01:09:13.697
<i>When the market stabilizes,</i>
<i>we'll unload them.</i>

01:09:13.731 --> 01:09:15.798
Hopefully Treasury will
get its money back.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:18.366
- Is that in the break-the-glass plan?
- Basically.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:20.353
My copy's missing some pages.

01:09:20.377 --> 01:09:21.719
Could someone else show me
the rest of--

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.787
It's succinct.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.036
We've got one shot
with Congress.

01:09:26.071 --> 01:09:29.705
You want them to write a piece
of legislation based on three pages?

01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:31.072
<i>Look, guys,</i>

01:09:31.107 --> 01:09:33.340
buying toxic assets
is gonna be a nightmare.

01:09:33.374 --> 01:09:35.174
Nobody knows what
the stuff's worth.

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:37.975
It'll take forever to untangle.
These banks are going down now.

01:09:38.009 --> 01:09:39.142
So what do we do?

01:09:39.176 --> 01:09:40.844
You want to unfreeze
credit, right?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.479
You want the banks
to lend people money?

01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:45.448
- <i>That's the goal.</i>
- So give them money to lend.

01:09:47.852 --> 01:09:49.752
Capital injections?

01:09:49.787 --> 01:09:51.353
Dan, come on.

01:09:51.377 --> 01:09:52.779
I can't believe you're
pulling out the "n" word.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.035
I'm not saying
nationalize the banks.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.290
I'm saying isolate the ones

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:57.259
that are really in trouble
and make an investment.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:58.661
It's unamerican.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.629
It's-- it's sure
unrepublican.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:03.131
You make the government
a stockholder--

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.933
what, do we tell them

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:07.535
how to manage themselves,
what to buy and sell?

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.387
Run them like the post Office?

01:10:09.412 --> 01:10:10.604
'Cause that works
like a dream.

01:10:10.605 --> 01:10:12.071
We make it
temporary.

01:10:12.105 --> 01:10:14.639
We make ourselves
nonvoting stockholders.

01:10:14.673 --> 01:10:17.706
You can't just hand the banks
massive piles of cash.

01:10:17.741 --> 01:10:19.574
Nobody's gonna
go for it.

01:10:19.609 --> 01:10:21.376
To the Republican's
it's nationalization.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:23.177
To the Democrats
it's a bailout.

01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:25.245
And the banks are
gonna go ballistic.

01:10:25.279 --> 01:10:28.081
Sorry, Dan,
not gonna happen.

01:10:28.115 --> 01:10:30.048
Kudos for
out-of-the-box thinking.

01:10:30.082 --> 01:10:32.782
Neel, if we go with your
plan to buy the assets,

01:10:32.817 --> 01:10:35.117
how much is it
gonna cost?

01:10:35.151 --> 01:10:36.518
It won't work.

01:10:36.552 --> 01:10:39.953
Look, the plan is
three pages long, totally vague.

01:10:39.988 --> 01:10:41.888
If buying the assets
doesn't work,

01:10:41.922 --> 01:10:43.856
we'll nationalize
the banks for you, okay?

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:45.324
How much?

01:10:45.358 --> 01:10:48.593
To be safe,
maybe a trillion.

01:10:48.627 --> 01:10:51.928
The Congress will never do
a trillion-- never.

01:10:51.962 --> 01:10:55.564
Well, there's $11 trillion
in residential mortgages.

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:58.100
There's $3 trillion
in commercial mortgages.

01:10:58.134 --> 01:11:00.802
That's $14 trillion,
right?

01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:03.771
You gotta figure
about 5% default rate.

01:11:03.805 --> 01:11:06.606
5% of $14 trillion

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.908
is $700 billion.

01:11:13.611 --> 01:11:16.512
It's better
than a trillion.

01:11:19.314 --> 01:11:21.214
<i>The only way</i>
<i>to get this done</i>

01:11:21.248 --> 01:11:23.248
<i>is to just</i>
<i>scare them shitless.</i>

01:11:23.283 --> 01:11:26.916
That should be easy.
I'm scared shitless myself.

01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.859
Troubled Asset
Relief Program?

01:11:41.893 --> 01:11:43.560
T.A.R.P.
We're calling it.

01:11:43.594 --> 01:11:46.061
This is your draft
of the bill?

01:11:46.095 --> 01:11:49.430
Subject to revision
certainly.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.098
Well, I've only got
three pages here.

01:11:53.133 --> 01:11:54.600
Am I missing something?

01:11:54.634 --> 01:11:55.868
No.

01:11:57.836 --> 01:12:01.137
You're just looking for a
big blank check in a hurry.

01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:04.639
It's all for the banks.
You don't want a penny

01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:07.108
for the average Joe
that's about to lose his house?

01:12:07.142 --> 01:12:09.210
There's not a scrap of oversight
built into this--

01:12:09.244 --> 01:12:11.712
not for the banks
or for you for that matter.

01:12:11.746 --> 01:12:13.714
You want us
to simply hand over

01:12:13.748 --> 01:12:16.949
$700 billion
and trust you?

01:12:16.984 --> 01:12:19.752
How is it possible
you didn't see this coming?

01:12:19.786 --> 01:12:21.853
If you want to rewind the tape,
we can do that.

01:12:21.888 --> 01:12:25.189
But right now the one thing
we don't have is time.

01:12:25.224 --> 01:12:27.858
We need an announcement tonight
to calm the market.

01:12:27.893 --> 01:12:30.028
We need legislation
next week.

01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:38.136
I spent my entire
academic career

01:12:38.170 --> 01:12:41.339
studying
the Great Depression.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:45.143
The Depression
may have started

01:12:45.177 --> 01:12:47.512
because of
a stock market crash,

01:12:47.546 --> 01:12:50.783
but what hit
the general economy

01:12:50.817 --> 01:12:52.718
was a disruption
of credit--

01:12:52.752 --> 01:12:54.787
<i>average citizens</i>
<i>unable to borrow money</i>

01:12:54.821 --> 01:12:57.022
to do anything--
to buy a home,

01:12:57.056 --> 01:13:01.292
start a business,
stock their shelves.

01:13:01.327 --> 01:13:04.895
Credit has the ability
to build a modern economy,

01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:07.265
but lack of credit
has the power to destroy it,

01:13:07.299 --> 01:13:09.734
swiftly and absolutely.

01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:14.473
If we do not act
boldly and immediately,

01:13:14.508 --> 01:13:17.610
we will replay
the Depression of the 1930s,

01:13:17.645 --> 01:13:21.082
only this time
it will be

01:13:21.116 --> 01:13:23.919
far far worse.

01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:26.989
We don't
do this now--

01:13:27.024 --> 01:13:30.594
we won't have
an economy on Monday.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.341
Geithner.

01:13:45.116 --> 01:13:47.018
We took the proposal
down to Congress.

01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:48.252
Are they gonna
go for it?

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:50.054
They didn't like the fact
that it was short.

01:13:50.089 --> 01:13:52.790
<i>I thought concise was a plus.</i>
<i>They thought it was flimsy</i>

01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:55.259
or arrogant
or something.

01:13:55.294 --> 01:13:58.196
I don't know what they think.
They couldn't get past it.

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.632
The market's in a death spiral.
They're gonna sink the bill

01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:02.433
because the proposal
is too fucking short?

01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:06.003
They're working on it.
They're gonna make it longer,

01:14:06.037 --> 01:14:08.205
among other things.

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:10.574
Look,

01:14:10.609 --> 01:14:12.543
just tell me
you got something.

01:14:15.047 --> 01:14:18.417
No.
No, we're nowhere.

01:14:18.451 --> 01:14:20.018
Who's left
for Morgan Stanley?

01:14:20.052 --> 01:14:24.055
China Investment
Corporation.

01:14:25.224 --> 01:14:27.491
Mae Mitsubishi.

01:14:27.525 --> 01:14:30.128
No, the Japanese will
never do this deal.

01:14:30.162 --> 01:14:31.730
How about Goldman?

01:14:31.764 --> 01:14:34.633
Goldman's looking at Wachovia,
but they're so fucked,

01:14:34.667 --> 01:14:36.668
even John Mack
turned up his nose.

01:14:39.439 --> 01:14:41.440
You gotta get
that bill passed.

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:42.708
I'm pushing.

01:14:42.743 --> 01:14:44.711
Well, push harder,

01:14:44.745 --> 01:14:47.247
please.

01:14:48.583 --> 01:14:51.885
This isn't working, Hank.

01:15:05.633 --> 01:15:07.802
Hank?

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.138
Could you excuse me
a moment?

01:15:31.397 --> 01:15:33.432
Oh my God.

01:15:33.467 --> 01:15:36.203
GAO, GAO,

01:15:36.237 --> 01:15:39.540
I am so sorry about this.
There's nothing we can do.

01:15:39.574 --> 01:15:41.542
It's New York, you know.
We're lucky

01:15:41.576 --> 01:15:43.845
we can still buy a beer
at Yankee Stadium.

01:15:43.879 --> 01:15:46.615
Don't worry about it.
I should quit anyway.

01:15:46.649 --> 01:15:49.052
When you're ready,
we'll be inside.

01:15:52.691 --> 01:15:54.458
Is there any
movement there?

01:15:54.492 --> 01:15:56.695
They made an extremely
low opening offer.

01:15:56.729 --> 01:15:59.031
I pretended
I didn't hear it.

01:15:59.066 --> 01:16:01.067
<i>The markets</i>
<i>can't open Monday</i>

01:16:01.102 --> 01:16:03.504
<i>without a resolution</i>
<i>on Morgan Stanley.</i>

01:16:03.538 --> 01:16:06.006
We really need you
to do a deal.

01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:08.374
- You need to call Jamie.
- I called Jamie.

01:16:08.409 --> 01:16:10.609
He doesn't want us.
There's too much overlap.

01:16:10.643 --> 01:16:12.010
We've spoken to him.
He'll do it.

01:16:12.044 --> 01:16:14.712
For what, a dollar?
Why would I do that?

01:16:14.747 --> 01:16:16.381
I got
China Investment

01:16:16.415 --> 01:16:18.149
and Mitsubishi
kicking my tires.

01:16:18.184 --> 01:16:21.720
I know those guys. They're not
gonna close a deal in time.

01:16:21.754 --> 01:16:24.923
We want you
to call Jamie.

01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:26.758
Let me ask you
a question.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:29.761
35,000 jobs just
disappeared in this city

01:16:29.795 --> 01:16:31.963
between A.I.G.,
Lehman and Bear.

01:16:31.997 --> 01:16:33.465
We make a deal
with Jamie--

01:16:33.499 --> 01:16:36.534
he'll fire 20,000
Morgan Stanley employees.

01:16:36.569 --> 01:16:38.703
You think that's good
public policy?

01:16:38.737 --> 01:16:42.173
John, we are looking
at the whole system here.

01:16:42.207 --> 01:16:44.158
The Chinese are leaving.

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.743
GAO found out we're also
talking to Mitsubishi.

01:16:45.744 --> 01:16:47.478
I gotta go.

01:16:47.513 --> 01:16:51.049
All right, get me Kuroyanagi
and a Japanese translator.

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:53.084
We're closing with
Mitsubishi tonight.

01:16:53.119 --> 01:16:55.720
Tim Geithner's
calling again.

01:16:55.754 --> 01:16:57.257
Cover your ears.

01:16:57.282 --> 01:16:58.982
You tell Tim Geithner
to fucking blow me.

01:16:58.991 --> 01:17:01.158
I'm trying to save
my company.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:06.564
Put him on the schedule,
but make sure it's after lunch,

01:17:06.598 --> 01:17:09.667
because that way I can
fit Maddle in beforehand.

01:17:09.702 --> 01:17:12.671
Morgan just made a deal
with Mitsubishi.

01:17:12.706 --> 01:17:14.674
So we're
the only bank

01:17:14.708 --> 01:17:17.010
with our dick
still in the wind.

01:17:17.044 --> 01:17:20.247
I'm calling
Buffett again.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.288
Grandpa, they keep calling.
What if it's important?

01:17:27.323 --> 01:17:29.758
They always think
it's important.

01:17:32.062 --> 01:17:35.598
All right,
I'll make it fast.

01:17:37.001 --> 01:17:39.002
Warren, thanks for calling back.
How are you?

01:17:39.037 --> 01:17:41.037
Just fine, Lloyd.

01:17:41.072 --> 01:17:42.737
What can I do
for you today?

01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:45.437
I'd like to talk to you about
taking a stake in Goldman Sachs.

01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:48.104
<i>What do you have in mind?</i>
<i>Sounds expensive.</i>

01:17:48.139 --> 01:17:50.306
Maybe not.

01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:54.608
<i>You'd better have</i>
<i>good news,</i>

01:17:54.643 --> 01:17:56.908
<i>because I might be dead</i>
<i>before we finish</i>

01:17:56.943 --> 01:17:59.109
<i>haggling over TARP.</i>

01:17:59.144 --> 01:18:02.079
Buffett's throwing
$5 billion into Goldman.

01:18:05.116 --> 01:18:07.651
We're off the ledge.

01:18:07.685 --> 01:18:09.720
<i>For a moment.</i>

01:18:09.754 --> 01:18:12.355
The October surprise
arrived a little early

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:15.125
with a game-changing jolt
to the White House race.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.094
Call it a master stroke

01:18:17.128 --> 01:18:19.129
or a desperate
Hail-Mary pass--

01:18:19.164 --> 01:18:22.400
McCain announced he would
suspend his campaign

01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:25.537
and asked for this Friday's
debate to be postponed

01:18:25.571 --> 01:18:28.807
So he can return to Washington
to focus on the economic crisis.

01:18:28.842 --> 01:18:31.977
Now is our chance
to come together,

01:18:32.012 --> 01:18:34.714
to prove that Washington
is once again

01:18:34.748 --> 01:18:37.917
capable of leading
this country.

01:18:37.951 --> 01:18:40.819
Thank God he came back.

01:18:40.854 --> 01:18:45.023
Like Daniel Day Lewis
in "Last of the Mohicans,"

01:18:45.057 --> 01:18:47.692
he will find us!

01:18:49.328 --> 01:18:51.562
- They're blowing it up.
- What happened?

01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:53.297
McCain wanted to swoop in
and save the day,

01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:54.932
but doesn't have any idea
how to do it.

01:18:54.966 --> 01:18:56.867
It's 100-page
piece of legislation

01:18:56.901 --> 01:18:58.935
we've been carefully
negotiating for days.

01:18:58.970 --> 01:19:01.138
What, did he think they were
gonna sit around and spitball?

01:19:01.172 --> 01:19:03.106
Yeah, when McCain
got here

01:19:03.141 --> 01:19:06.409
and found out that the deal
was basically done, he went apeshit.

01:19:06.444 --> 01:19:08.311
The Republicans fell in
behind their guy.

01:19:08.346 --> 01:19:10.046
They want to start
all over again.

01:19:10.081 --> 01:19:12.315
Democrats flipped out.
Republicans dug in.

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.751
Clusterfuck.

01:19:14.785 --> 01:19:18.088
- Where's Hank?
- Still talking to McCain.

01:19:18.122 --> 01:19:20.523
If you or anyone else
does anything

01:19:20.558 --> 01:19:24.060
that causes a depression,
it is not gonna be on me.

01:19:24.095 --> 01:19:26.697
I have a big mouth, Senator--

01:19:26.722 --> 01:19:27.897
- a very big mouth.
- Hold on...

01:19:27.898 --> 01:19:30.333
He's not threatening

01:19:30.367 --> 01:19:32.801
the Republican
Presidential Nominee, is he?

01:19:32.836 --> 01:19:35.303
- Something's got to be done.
- No no. Excuse me, please.

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:37.305
Where are the Democrats?

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.141
They're right down
this way.

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.709
- Is Nancy there?
- Yes. Yes, she is.

01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:42.044
Thank you.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:51.686
<i>Nancy...</i>

01:19:55.356 --> 01:19:57.624
Gee, Hank.

01:19:57.659 --> 01:19:59.559
I didn't know
you were Catholic.

01:20:01.194 --> 01:20:03.296
I beg of you, don't blow this up.
It was a bad meeting,

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:05.364
but we need to get
together on this.

01:20:05.399 --> 01:20:07.367
We're not the ones
trying to blow it up.

01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:09.871
I just ask you
to stay with us.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.143
Please.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.978
The House began debating
the rescue bill

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.479
at 9:27 this morning.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:21.282
<i>At about 1:28 pm</i>
<i>Congress did finally act.</i>

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:23.618
- This is a squeaker of a vote.
- <i>We are down to it right now.</i>

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.887
<i>It looks like the Democrats</i>
<i>delivered their caucus</i>

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.089
<i>and the Republicans</i>
<i>so far have not.</i>

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:30.325
<i>What do you think they could do</i>
<i>to change the bill</i>

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.227
<i>to get a few Republican votes</i>
<i>over to the other side?</i>

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:34.028
<i>If they hang</i>
<i>Wall Street CEOs,</i>

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:35.463
<i>I think that would get</i>
<i>a few more votes.</i>

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.265
<i>You know, I'm not--</i>
<i>I'm not sure</i>

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.167
<i>what they could do</i>
<i>exactly.</i>

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:42.570
<i>It is possible that the leadership</i>
<i>of the Congress would conclude</i>

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:45.573
<i>that there's nothing that can</i>
<i>get a majority of support</i>

01:20:45.608 --> 01:20:48.342
<i>and see what Hank Paulson can do</i>
<i>and the administration can do--</i>

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.312
<i>Leaders are negotiating</i>
<i>right now</i>

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.548
<i>who'll risk their seats.</i>
<i>And that's what I'm hearing.</i>

01:20:54.582 --> 01:20:57.114
Pelosi wouldn't have brought
the bill to the floor if she

01:20:57.139 --> 01:20:58.316
didn't think it would pass.

01:20:58.317 --> 01:20:59.852
<i>I don't know the answer</i>
<i>to that, Charlie. I can't answer.</i>

01:20:59.922 --> 01:21:01.890
<i>I'm just reading an email</i>
<i>that's coming to me.</i>

01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:03.327
<i>I think the bottom line</i>

01:21:03.328 --> 01:21:04.435
<i>is they gotta go back</i>
<i>to the drawing board.</i>

01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.127
<i>Do they have the time</i>
<i>though to do that?</i>

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.860
<i>Look at the Dow Jones</i>
<i>Industrial Average.</i>

01:21:07.894 --> 01:21:09.794
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>you're gonna get a--</i>

01:21:09.829 --> 01:21:10.939
<i>At this point we just</i>

01:21:10.964 --> 01:21:12.364
<i>gotta hold on to the sides</i>
<i>of the kayak</i>

01:21:12.365 --> 01:21:13.798
<i>and ride through this</i>
<i>because--</i>

01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:15.765
<i>They didn't pass it.</i>

01:21:15.799 --> 01:21:17.799
- <i>They did not pass it.</i>
- <i>It just wasn't enough.</i>

01:21:17.834 --> 01:21:22.002
<i>They're gonna end up being</i>
<i>nine votes short, Bill.</i>

01:21:22.037 --> 01:21:23.703
<i>Say that again, Steve.</i>

01:21:23.738 --> 01:21:25.638
<i>I think they're gonna end up</i>
<i>being nine votes--</i>

01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.906
<i>if they get all six--</i>
<i>five of the remaining votes,</i>

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:31.808
<i>they'll be 10 votes short now--</i>
<i>if they get all five remaining.</i>

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:33.543
<i>The writing is</i>
<i>on the wall there.</i>

01:21:33.577 --> 01:21:35.711
<i>And we're here</i>
<i>down on the floor.</i>

01:21:35.745 --> 01:21:38.079
<i>Traders have been standing around.</i>
<i>We're all here in knots.</i>

01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:45.991
The networks are waiting for you
in the press room.

01:21:46.025 --> 01:21:49.027
I can't even--

01:22:00.942 --> 01:22:02.943
We have to
go back again.

01:22:02.977 --> 01:22:05.446
They don't get
to say no on this.

01:22:06.347 --> 01:22:07.981
Okay.

01:22:08.016 --> 01:22:09.149
The White House
wants a meeting.

01:22:09.184 --> 01:22:11.151
Good. We'll come up
with a new strategy.

01:22:11.186 --> 01:22:13.220
The White House has to
push harder on the Hill.

01:22:13.255 --> 01:22:16.090
Meanwhile we need to keep working
on what we do with the money.

01:22:16.124 --> 01:22:17.591
Let's act like
this is gonna work.

01:22:17.626 --> 01:22:19.426
In that case, let's talk
about cash injections.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.672
Here we go again.

01:22:20.697 --> 01:22:22.028
We can't nationalize
the banks.

01:22:22.029 --> 01:22:23.101
It's not nationali--

01:22:23.126 --> 01:22:24.626
That's how Japan got itself
a decade-long recession.

01:22:24.697 --> 01:22:27.165
Is that where
we want to go?

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:29.367
What else do we have?

01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:30.935
Cash-for-trash.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.860
Buying toxic assets
is still our go-to move.

01:22:33.638 --> 01:22:37.074
All right.
Find a way to simplify it.

01:22:37.108 --> 01:22:39.977
Dan, work something up.

01:22:40.011 --> 01:22:43.114
For discussion purposes,
let's see what it would look like.

01:22:54.027 --> 01:22:56.796
For those who supported the
$700 billion Wall Street bailout,

01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:59.031
it was a surprising
and stunning failure

01:22:59.066 --> 01:23:01.367
when the House of Representatives
voted to reject it.

01:23:01.401 --> 01:23:03.836
<i>It's a stinging defeat</i>
<i>for President Bush</i>

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.573
<i>delivered at the hands</i>
<i>of his fellow Republicans.</i>

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:10.042
We put forth a plan
that was big

01:23:10.077 --> 01:23:11.811
because we've got
a big problem.

01:23:11.845 --> 01:23:15.748
The reality is that we're
in an urgent situation.

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:19.018
and the consequences
will grow worse each day

01:23:19.053 --> 01:23:20.486
if we do not act.

01:23:20.521 --> 01:23:21.988
I know.
I keep telling--

01:23:22.022 --> 01:23:23.489
draft of
the new bill.

01:23:23.524 --> 01:23:25.124
Are they having
any luck with it?

01:23:25.159 --> 01:23:27.694
The White House thinks they
got a better shot of pushing it

01:23:27.729 --> 01:23:30.297
through the Senate side first.
Hopefully they're right.

01:23:30.332 --> 01:23:32.266
They asked us to back off
and let them handle it.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:35.203
So I'm-- I'm--
I'm trying to back off.

01:23:40.242 --> 01:23:43.077
Buying toxic assets
isn't gonna work.

01:23:43.112 --> 01:23:44.678
Why not?

01:23:44.713 --> 01:23:46.246
It's too slow.

01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:47.714
I think I've been
saying that.

01:23:47.748 --> 01:23:49.715
Well, we knew it was complicated,
but how slow--?

01:23:49.749 --> 01:23:51.216
Two months,
maybe more.

01:23:51.251 --> 01:23:52.634
Oh.

01:23:52.659 --> 01:23:53.959
How is it possible
we didn't know how--?

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:58.256
I didn't ask how long
it would take, okay?

01:23:58.290 --> 01:24:00.624
Can we move on?

01:24:00.659 --> 01:24:04.428
So maybe we can talk about
capital injections.

01:24:04.462 --> 01:24:06.330
Dan, we really can't.

01:24:06.364 --> 01:24:08.499
I think
we're gonna have to.

01:24:08.533 --> 01:24:11.035
Even if neel could
expedite the process,

01:24:11.069 --> 01:24:14.605
which seems unlikely,

01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:16.607
<i>the system</i>
<i>is crumbling.</i>

01:24:16.641 --> 01:24:19.343
<i>The banks need</i>
<i>money now.</i>

01:24:19.377 --> 01:24:22.880
If cash injections are the most
efficient way to stabilize them,

01:24:22.914 --> 01:24:26.049
then we can't back off

01:24:26.083 --> 01:24:28.051
because we're uncomfortable
being the men

01:24:28.085 --> 01:24:30.387
who nationalized
a few American banks.

01:24:30.421 --> 01:24:32.055
It's faster,
that's for sure.

01:24:32.089 --> 01:24:34.157
It will push us back
off the precipice, yes,

01:24:34.191 --> 01:24:37.760
unfreeze the system.

01:24:37.795 --> 01:24:40.530
We give them some money

01:24:40.564 --> 01:24:43.866
and they lend it out.

01:24:47.738 --> 01:24:49.205
The motion is adopted.

01:24:49.239 --> 01:24:51.574
After rejecting the Bush
Administration's T.A.R.P. Plan

01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:54.211
only four days ago,
the House passed it today.

01:24:54.245 --> 01:24:56.081
The big question now--

01:24:56.106 --> 01:24:57.906
whether investors will take
comfort in the news.

01:24:57.949 --> 01:24:59.916
<i>Current indicators show</i>
<i>the stock market</i>

01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:02.986
<i>is continuing</i>
<i>its freefall.</i>

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:22.673
<i>Hello.</i>

01:25:22.707 --> 01:25:25.009
Warren, it's Hank.

01:25:25.043 --> 01:25:28.112
I-- I-- I'm sorry.
It's late.

01:25:28.146 --> 01:25:30.447
Am I waking you?

01:25:30.482 --> 01:25:32.917
<i>No, not at all.</i>

01:25:32.951 --> 01:25:35.085
Can I pick your brain
for a minute?

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.888
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

01:25:37.922 --> 01:25:41.559
How do you get
a healthy bank

01:25:41.593 --> 01:25:44.461
to accept
a capital injection?

01:26:38.483 --> 01:26:40.951
I had to drag my ass all the
way here from California.

01:26:40.986 --> 01:26:42.887
They wouldn't even
tell my why.

01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:44.789
Nobody knows
what this is about?

01:26:44.823 --> 01:26:46.924
Nope.

01:26:52.097 --> 01:26:53.764
Talk to Jamie?

01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:56.034
Yep. He'll be fine.

01:26:56.068 --> 01:26:57.903
Did you tell him
what was coming?

01:26:57.937 --> 01:27:00.038
Uh, did I tell him we're about
to make him swallow

01:27:00.073 --> 01:27:03.409
a capital injection
he doesn't need? No.

01:27:03.443 --> 01:27:06.112
I-- I told him
we need his help

01:27:06.146 --> 01:27:09.583
and I asked him very politely
not to fuck with us today.

01:27:10.952 --> 01:27:12.286
He got it.

01:27:13.588 --> 01:27:15.656
She's here.

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:22.598
Gentlemen.

01:27:22.632 --> 01:27:24.366
We think this is
gonna work?

01:27:24.401 --> 01:27:26.769
Oh yeah.
They're gonna love it.

01:27:48.895 --> 01:27:50.829
We are of the view

01:27:50.864 --> 01:27:52.831
that the United States
needs

01:27:52.866 --> 01:27:55.534
to take strong,
decisive action

01:27:55.568 --> 01:27:58.703
to arrest the stress

01:27:58.737 --> 01:28:02.239
in our financial system.

01:28:02.273 --> 01:28:05.308
Through our new
T.A.R.P. Authority,

01:28:05.342 --> 01:28:08.277
Treasury will purchase

01:28:08.311 --> 01:28:10.546
preferred stock

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.514
in each of the banks
represented in this room.

01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:18.284
<i>That stock will yield 5%</i>
<i>the first five years,</i>

01:28:18.319 --> 01:28:21.253
<i>9% after that.</i>

01:28:21.287 --> 01:28:23.954
We give you money;
You lend it out.

01:28:23.989 --> 01:28:27.390
It will unfreeze credit,
stabilize the banks,

01:28:27.425 --> 01:28:29.292
restore confidence.

01:28:29.327 --> 01:28:31.394
<i>Everyone will be</i>
<i>better off</i>

01:28:31.428 --> 01:28:33.428
with more capital
in the system.

01:28:33.463 --> 01:28:35.496
And that is why

01:28:35.531 --> 01:28:39.366
all nine of you

01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:42.269
will participate
in the program.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:47.508
Some of us don't need
any capital.

01:28:47.542 --> 01:28:50.011
You all need capital.

01:28:50.045 --> 01:28:52.579
You have no idea what the
market's gonna look like in a year.

01:28:52.614 --> 01:28:54.681
Neither do you.

01:28:54.716 --> 01:28:56.683
I'm not one of you
New York guys

01:28:56.717 --> 01:28:58.652
with your
fancy products.

01:28:58.686 --> 01:29:01.555
Well, why am I in this room
talking about bailing you out?

01:29:01.589 --> 01:29:05.158
The stronger banks will serve
as cover for the weaker banks.

01:29:05.192 --> 01:29:07.794
If just some of you take it,
the money is a signal

01:29:07.828 --> 01:29:10.897
that a bank is too weak to survive.
The market will devour it.

01:29:10.931 --> 01:29:13.633
How much are we
talking about?

01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:16.603
$125 billion.

01:29:18.739 --> 01:29:20.707
<i>Bank of America--</i>
<i>$15 billion.</i>

01:29:20.741 --> 01:29:23.042
<i>Bank of New York Mellon--</i>
<i>$3 billion.</i>

01:29:23.077 --> 01:29:26.579
<i>Citigroup--</i>
<i>$25 billion.</i>

01:29:26.613 --> 01:29:29.916
<i>Goldman Sachs--</i>
<i>$10 billion.</i>

01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:33.252
<i>J.P. Morgan--</i>
<i>$25 billion.</i>

01:29:33.287 --> 01:29:35.521
<i>Merrill Lynch--</i>
<i>$10 billion.</i>

01:29:35.556 --> 01:29:38.057
<i>Morgan Stanley--</i>
<i>$10 billion.</i>

01:29:38.091 --> 01:29:41.227
<i>State Street--</i>
<i>$2 billion.</i>

01:29:41.261 --> 01:29:43.596
<i>Wells Fargo--</i>
<i>$25 billion.</i>

01:29:49.469 --> 01:29:53.105
What happened
to buying toxic assets?

01:29:53.139 --> 01:29:54.707
Wasn't that the idea?

01:29:54.741 --> 01:29:56.241
<i>It's too slow.</i>

01:29:56.276 --> 01:29:58.343
You'll be dead
before we sort it out.

01:29:58.378 --> 01:30:01.780
So we're just handing
the reins over to you?

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:03.448
The deal's actually
pretty good.

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:06.117
You turn your nose up at this now,
and we have to rescue you later--

01:30:06.152 --> 01:30:07.919
the terms won't be
nearly as attractive.

01:30:07.953 --> 01:30:10.588
It's cheap capital.
It's not the worst idea in the world.

01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:12.557
Well, it is for those of us
who already have capital.

01:30:12.591 --> 01:30:14.692
We will be nonvoting
shareholders.

01:30:14.727 --> 01:30:17.228
This will be
a temporary measure.

01:30:19.665 --> 01:30:21.799
What if we decline
to be involved?

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:25.369
The Chairman of the FDIC
is sitting right there.

01:30:25.404 --> 01:30:27.071
<i>Tomorrow you'll</i>
<i>find out</i>

01:30:27.105 --> 01:30:29.473
<i>that you're not as well-capitalized</i>
<i>as you think you are.</i>

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:31.475
What kind of protections
can you offer on changes

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.110
for compensation policy?

01:30:33.144 --> 01:30:35.980
I mean, if the government
is going to become a part-owner,

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:37.982
does that mean
that the government

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:40.551
is going to dictate
compensation?

01:30:40.585 --> 01:30:42.786
Are you asking me about your
bonus right now, John?

01:30:42.821 --> 01:30:45.155
I'm running
a company.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.157
If the Fed tells me
I can't offer

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.460
competitive pay
for talent,

01:30:49.494 --> 01:30:52.662
you're gonna launch the biggest brain
drain this country's ever seen.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:54.530
Is that the way you want
to run the banks?

01:30:54.565 --> 01:30:56.565
Until the money is repaid
to the Treasury,

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.035
there will be some limitations on tax
deductions and golden parachutes.

01:31:00.069 --> 01:31:02.103
- Well, there you go.
- I don't really understand

01:31:02.137 --> 01:31:04.738
why there needs to be
so much tension about this.

01:31:04.772 --> 01:31:06.706
The country is facing

01:31:06.741 --> 01:31:09.242
the worst economy
since the Great Depression.

01:31:09.276 --> 01:31:11.744
If the financial system
collapses,

01:31:11.778 --> 01:31:14.680
it will take
every one of you down.

01:31:22.887 --> 01:31:25.088
Give me the papers.

01:31:32.461 --> 01:31:34.095
- You can't just sign it.
- Oh no?

01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:37.764
- Not without your board.
- My board's on 24-hour notice.

01:31:37.798 --> 01:31:40.032
I think they'll
go along with it.

01:31:40.067 --> 01:31:44.669
And if they don't,
they'll fire me.

01:31:50.111 --> 01:31:52.879
Anyone else?

01:31:57.954 --> 01:32:00.222
Are they gonna do it?

01:32:01.491 --> 01:32:03.125
They're calling
their boards.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.628
- That's a good sign.
- If they do go along with this,

01:32:05.663 --> 01:32:08.331
we should announce
something alongside the injections--

01:32:08.366 --> 01:32:11.402
maybe a program
to buy up mortgages.

01:32:11.436 --> 01:32:13.137
I'm not rushing out
some half-assed plan

01:32:13.172 --> 01:32:14.940
just to make it look like
we're doing something.

01:32:14.974 --> 01:32:17.376
Maybe we just beef up
the restrictions

01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:20.147
on how they
spend the money--

01:32:20.181 --> 01:32:21.983
something to take
the stink off.

01:32:22.017 --> 01:32:24.686
Put more restrictions on it--
they won't take it.

01:32:29.292 --> 01:32:31.628
One thing too many
for today.

01:32:33.799 --> 01:32:35.733
They almost bring down

01:32:35.768 --> 01:32:37.569
the U.S. economy
as we know it,

01:32:37.603 --> 01:32:40.071
but we can't put restrictions
on how they spend

01:32:40.105 --> 01:32:43.308
the $125 billion
we're giving them,

01:32:43.342 --> 01:32:47.545
because they might not
take it.

01:33:19.077 --> 01:33:21.311
What's this?

01:33:21.345 --> 01:33:25.148
That is, um...

01:33:25.182 --> 01:33:27.684
A poison dart frog.

01:33:27.718 --> 01:33:31.054
Wendy took it
in Guyana.

01:33:43.467 --> 01:33:46.069
Is this yours?

01:33:50.808 --> 01:33:53.142
Al Capone's.

01:33:55.245 --> 01:33:56.746
Eight out of the nine
are in.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.781
B of A is still waiting
on its board, but--

01:33:58.816 --> 01:34:01.317
it's gonna go through.

01:34:01.352 --> 01:34:03.953
<i>I'll call the Speaker's</i>
<i>office.</i>

01:34:03.987 --> 01:34:06.989
And we're gonna get you
on the phone with the President.

01:34:07.024 --> 01:34:09.826
<i>Okay.</i>

01:34:12.763 --> 01:34:15.564
Dow is up 900 points

01:34:15.599 --> 01:34:17.967
just because
we were meeting.

01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:24.274
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

01:34:24.308 --> 01:34:26.843
That's good.

01:34:26.877 --> 01:34:29.578
It was the right thing.

01:34:29.612 --> 01:34:32.515
<i>Absolutely.</i>

01:34:32.549 --> 01:34:34.483
I was prepared
for more blowback.

01:34:34.518 --> 01:34:37.586
They didn't have
a choice.

01:34:37.621 --> 01:34:39.989
They knew that.

01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:46.195
Well, I certainly hope
that they--

01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:47.497
What?

01:34:49.366 --> 01:34:53.569
I hope they use the money
the way we're asking them to.

01:34:53.604 --> 01:34:58.541
They will lend it out,
won't they?

01:34:59.776 --> 01:35:02.478
Of course they will.

01:35:13.957 --> 01:35:16.458
Of course they will.
