WEBVTT

00:02.735 --> 00:04.213
I wasn't even expecting you.

00:04.237 --> 00:05.840
How come you didn't
use your own keys?

00:05.864 --> 00:07.341
Were you waiting out there long?

00:07.365 --> 00:08.926
No, not very.

00:08.950 --> 00:10.845
So anyway, we're
just sitting there

00:10.869 --> 00:14.339
and he just walks in, like,
"Hello, I'm your grandfather."

00:14.831 --> 00:17.393
And nobody knew what
to say, you know?

00:17.417 --> 00:20.354
And I don't... I don't really
know what it means, that he...

00:20.378 --> 00:21.888
that he showed up.

00:22.047 --> 00:23.357
I mean, maybe...

00:23.381 --> 00:25.610
Maybe I guilted him into
wanting to meet them.

00:25.634 --> 00:28.728
But, then... Then,
can we trust him?

00:29.012 --> 00:30.323
You know, is he
gonna stick around?

00:30.347 --> 00:33.524
The guy's definitely got a history of
flaking out on people, that's for sure.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.570
- Take off your jacket.
- I wasn't planning on staying.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.198
Apparently, neither are you.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.417
What?

00:41.441 --> 00:44.420
Well, I ran into Warren
Danziger at the coffeehouse.

00:44.444 --> 00:45.713
He had a message for you.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.590
He said that he got into
Hampshire State, too,

00:47.614 --> 00:49.415
and if you were looking
for a roommate...

00:49.699 --> 00:52.053
And I said, "What are
you talking about?

00:52.077 --> 00:53.930
You know, Bailey's not going
back East for school.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.514
He's staying here
in San Francisco."

00:55.538 --> 00:58.174
But apparently that's not what
your guidance counselor told him.

00:59.501 --> 01:01.219
Okay.

01:02.420 --> 01:03.972
Okay, look. First of all...

01:04.339 --> 01:06.442
First of all, when I applied
to Hampshire State,

01:06.466 --> 01:10.029
you and I, we weren't even...
we weren't even together yet.

01:10.053 --> 01:12.698
And I never thought that I
would get into that place.

01:12.722 --> 01:15.942
It was, like, this huge long shot.
Really.

01:16.226 --> 01:18.528
Okay. Yes.

01:19.062 --> 01:20.863
Yes, I got accepted.

01:21.856 --> 01:23.574
But you're not gonna go, right?

01:25.235 --> 01:27.755
- Well...
- God.

01:27.779 --> 01:31.175
Sarah, listen, before
you get upset,

01:31.199 --> 01:33.177
I-I know what you're
thinking, and...

01:33.201 --> 01:35.179
And you have to know that
me going away to college

01:35.203 --> 01:36.972
isn't gonna change anything
between us at all.

01:36.996 --> 01:38.683
What are you talking
about, Bailey?

01:38.707 --> 01:40.893
You're leaving. You're
going 3000 miles away.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.728
You're going as far away
from here as you can get.

01:42.752 --> 01:44.313
- That changes everything.
- Sarah, listen...

01:44.337 --> 01:47.306
You're someone to be
talking about flaking out.

02:28.673 --> 02:30.600
Okay!

02:30.800 --> 02:33.279
- Okay.
- Who's she talking to?

02:33.303 --> 02:34.655
Jake.

02:34.679 --> 02:37.658
Grandpa Jake. Sounds
kind of weird.

02:37.682 --> 02:39.285
Yeah. Bye.

02:39.309 --> 02:41.569
Okay. Bye.

02:41.978 --> 02:45.082
- What did he want?
- I called him. Just to talk.

02:45.106 --> 02:47.293
You let her call him?

02:47.317 --> 02:50.036
It's a free country.
What's with you?

02:50.612 --> 02:52.673
I was thinking about him all night.
And you guys...

02:52.697 --> 02:54.759
I can't believe it. And
I can't believe that...

02:54.783 --> 02:56.093
this is actually happening.

02:56.117 --> 02:58.095
- You know, that he came back.
- Claudia.

02:58.119 --> 03:00.890
You know, he's not exactly how I pictured
him. But, I mean, it doesn't matter.

03:00.914 --> 03:03.768
It's just like, you know, all of a
sudden, we have a whole family.

03:03.792 --> 03:07.104
- We already have a family.
- Well, yeah, no, I know, but...

03:07.128 --> 03:08.731
I'd slow down a little, Claud.

03:08.755 --> 03:11.108
We spent, what, two
hours with the guy?

03:11.132 --> 03:13.152
Look at his track record.

03:13.176 --> 03:15.029
So you're not even gonna
give him a chance?

03:15.053 --> 03:17.782
Let's see if the guy sticks around.
That's the most important thing.

03:17.806 --> 03:20.451
I bet he will. I mean, after
what he said last night...

03:20.475 --> 03:23.287
What did he say? He
didn't say anything.

03:23.311 --> 03:25.623
He asked a lot of
questions about Mom.

03:25.647 --> 03:27.958
And he said that he
was a terrible father

03:27.982 --> 03:29.376
and that he felt guilty
for leaving her.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.837
Whoop-dee-doo. Like that was
hard to admit 30 years later.

03:31.861 --> 03:34.122
Look, Jule, I'm
angry at him too.

03:34.364 --> 03:35.841
I just... I want him around.

03:35.865 --> 03:37.593
Yeah, well, I don't.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.638
And we're doing fine. I don't know
what the hell we need him for.

03:40.662 --> 03:43.423
We don't need him for anything.
I mean, that's not the point.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.052
Anyway, we're doing something
together this afternoon.

03:48.336 --> 03:50.147
- You are not.
- I am too.

03:50.171 --> 03:52.983
No, you're not. We don't even know
this guy. He's practically a stranger.

03:53.007 --> 03:55.528
You're not going out by yourself
with a stranger. Forget it.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.104
Look, he's my grandfather.
I mean, you can't stop me.

04:00.723 --> 04:03.067
Charlie, you trust this guy?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.611
Then go with her, Jule.

04:07.939 --> 04:10.835
Look, I am... I am just
going away to college.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.837
People go away to college,
like, constantly.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.922
Right, no big deal. That's
why you kept it a secret.

04:14.946 --> 04:17.925
No! That's not... I
don't know, look...

04:17.949 --> 04:19.677
I guess... Okay, I was
afraid of how you'd react.

04:19.701 --> 04:21.678
- I didn't wanna upset you.
- Oh, God, don't give me that.

04:21.702 --> 04:23.848
- What a load of crap.
- Okay, look.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.474
I am a senior, right?

04:25.498 --> 04:28.269
So didn't it ever occur to you that I
might think about going away to college?

04:28.293 --> 04:30.187
No, it didn't, okay? It didn't.

04:30.211 --> 04:32.481
And maybe it's because you never
mentioned that you were interested.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.483
And you talked about state
schools all the time.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.058
- I...
- Last week!

04:36.134 --> 04:39.738
So, no. The idea that you'd wanna
leave me never occurred to me.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.615
I don't want to
leave you, Sarah.

04:41.639 --> 04:43.274
Remember these?

04:43.558 --> 04:45.035
Key to your house.
You gave it to me.

04:45.059 --> 04:48.205
And you said that that would be a place that
I could go, where I'd be safe and loved.

04:48.229 --> 04:49.780
- Yes.
- Thanks.

04:50.231 --> 04:51.991
Sarah, don't you think you're...

04:57.113 --> 05:00.041
Don't you think you're
overreacting here a little bit?

05:00.074 --> 05:01.969
Listen. There are...

05:01.993 --> 05:03.846
There are tons of
school vacations.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.223
There's Christmas break.
There's spring break.

05:06.247 --> 05:08.726
And you can come visit
me whenever you want to.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.519
And we'll talk on the
phone all the time.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.022
And we'll get the e-mail thing,
so we can write each other,

05:13.046 --> 05:14.773
like, four, five times
a day if you want.

05:14.797 --> 05:16.233
Like that's even close
to the same thing.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.985
Like 3000 miles away
doesn't matter.

05:18.009 --> 05:19.602
Sarah...

05:19.969 --> 05:22.281
Look, it's not like
I'm leaving tomorrow.

05:22.305 --> 05:24.899
You know, I'm not.
We still have...

05:25.433 --> 05:27.995
We still have six months.
That is a lot of time.

05:28.019 --> 05:29.987
It's more time than
we've been going out.

05:32.106 --> 05:34.742
- So, six months?
- Yeah.

05:36.194 --> 05:38.881
Okay, so we can spend pretty
much every minute together?

05:38.905 --> 05:41.508
Right. See? Exactly.

05:41.532 --> 05:45.002
And I can fall even
more in love with you?

05:45.912 --> 05:47.588
You could.

05:48.164 --> 05:50.675
Yeah, and then, it'll hurt
that much more when you leave.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.357
Call screening. It's gotta
have call screening,

05:56.381 --> 05:58.442
because I cannot stand
talking to Wayne anymore.

05:58.466 --> 05:59.860
Last week, what was it? Oh.

05:59.884 --> 06:02.488
His skin was breaking
out from loneliness.

06:02.512 --> 06:05.741
I mean, my God, we've been
apart five months now.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.483
Enough already.

06:09.143 --> 06:11.789
Can I get some help, please?

06:11.813 --> 06:14.073
Get some help for Wayne.

06:14.565 --> 06:17.243
Hey, you should look at
cell phones, Charlie.

06:17.527 --> 06:20.047
It's getting impossible to track you down.
I call you at home,

06:20.071 --> 06:21.256
they think you're at Salinger's.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.000
I call you at Salinger's,
they say you're at home.

06:24.325 --> 06:27.128
Nobody ever seems to know
where you are anymore.

06:29.455 --> 06:30.933
Looking for a beeper?

06:30.957 --> 06:32.977
No. Not really.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.436
They're pretty
popular these days.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.981
A lot of kids have them.
Big with doctors too.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.931
High-profile business types.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.017
Guys cheating on their
wives or girl...

06:42.844 --> 06:44.603
Sorry.

06:46.305 --> 06:48.482
How much did you say
these things were?

06:51.185 --> 06:53.122
Well, if anything
strikes your fancy,

06:53.146 --> 06:55.040
you just say the word.

06:55.064 --> 06:57.292
Thanks, Grandpa.

06:57.316 --> 07:00.295
The same offer goes
for you, Julia.

07:00.319 --> 07:03.173
Um, no, thanks. I don't like
buying in places like these.

07:03.197 --> 07:04.967
Really? Why not?

07:04.991 --> 07:07.678
Well, just because
something's from the past,

07:07.702 --> 07:11.964
everyone seems to think that it's
so precious and so valuable.

07:12.206 --> 07:14.342
Most of the time, it's
just a big ripoff.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.053
Of course, you never know, uh...

07:17.253 --> 07:20.681
either way, unless you
take a really good look.

07:21.424 --> 07:23.809
For instance, what do
you think of this?

07:24.010 --> 07:26.479
- It's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

07:26.596 --> 07:28.407
Well, let's buy this.

07:28.431 --> 07:30.983
Wow. Thanks.

07:31.309 --> 07:34.455
What do you think? Have you got
anybody in mind to put in there?

07:34.479 --> 07:36.238
Mm, I don't know.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.824
Then, I can help you with that.

07:40.276 --> 07:41.619
Now, here

07:41.652 --> 07:43.454
is your Mom

07:45.365 --> 07:48.292
when she was about two
years younger than you.

07:48.743 --> 07:50.586
Wow.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.975
Jule, look at this. Look
what Grandpa bought me.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.802
It's okay. I know exactly
what he's buying, Claudia.

08:00.838 --> 08:03.933
I couldn't help but
notice that yours was...

08:04.300 --> 08:07.196
Well, the hands were broken,
and the crystal was cracked,

08:07.220 --> 08:10.022
and the strap was frayed, so...

08:10.139 --> 08:12.159
- Wow.
- You like it?

08:12.183 --> 08:14.652
Yeah. Yeah.

08:15.019 --> 08:17.664
But it's not like there's
a special occasion.

08:17.688 --> 08:19.500
It's February.

08:19.524 --> 08:22.159
We're celebrating February.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.787
The shortest month of the year.

08:25.154 --> 08:27.331
I forgot to get you something.

08:27.615 --> 08:31.335
It's okay. This is not
about even exchanges.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.557
- Mm. You know what I could do?
- Hmm?

08:35.581 --> 08:37.893
I could, uh, fix that
window in your bathroom,

08:37.917 --> 08:39.727
the one where the sill's warped?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.230
- Charlie...
- No, it's no problem.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.481
I mean, I've got the
tools in my truck.

08:42.505 --> 08:46.559
Charlie... I don't want
you fixing my windows.

08:47.468 --> 08:48.853
Why not?

08:49.095 --> 08:52.732
Because I have people
who can do that for me.

08:54.684 --> 08:57.278
And that's not what
I need you for.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.701
What is that?

09:05.528 --> 09:07.663
I got a beeper.

09:10.491 --> 09:12.418
The kids.

09:16.205 --> 09:17.808
I didn't know what else to do.

09:17.832 --> 09:19.768
I mean... And I know
you just saw one,

09:19.792 --> 09:21.979
but I swear there are
at least two, and...

09:22.003 --> 09:24.064
Ew, I may have to move!

09:24.088 --> 09:26.900
Well, there was only one in the
trap, and we got rid of it, so...

09:26.924 --> 09:29.185
I think you can probably
come down from there now.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.239
Good. Good.

09:32.263 --> 09:34.366
As long as I don't have to
spend a minute here alone,

09:34.390 --> 09:36.692
then I promise not to be afraid.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.997
Emily, uh, I don't know.

09:40.021 --> 09:43.292
It's been kind of a...
a weird, long night.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.628
- And I thought I'd just...
- Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.914
You've been bugging me about
this for a long time.

09:50.531 --> 09:52.926
And now you're here, and
I'm here, and it's late.

09:52.950 --> 09:55.586
And you are not going anywhere.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.511
Okay?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.724
- Okay.
- Good.

10:09.550 --> 10:12.353
Um, here's the thing.

10:12.637 --> 10:15.240
Could you carry me
into the bedroom?

10:15.264 --> 10:19.568
Because I am not setting foot
on this floor ever again.

10:20.895 --> 10:22.655
Okay.

Um... yeah.

11:09.485 --> 11:11.588
Maybe that would be all right.

11:11.612 --> 11:15.457
For us to... get to know

11:16.909 --> 11:18.460

- Not now. I don't wanna talk.

11:34.593 --> 11:37.021
No. It's not about that.

11:37.847 --> 11:40.190
Somebody that wants to meet you.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.537
Hi.

11:43.561 --> 11:46.030
I'm, um...

11:47.106 --> 11:48.782
Yeah.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.659
Yeah, I know who you are.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.462
Last call, everybody.

11:52.486 --> 11:54.455
We're out of here in five.

11:55.740 --> 11:57.499
Hey, man.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.337
Give them twenty more
minutes, would you?

12:01.954 --> 12:03.589
Thanks.

12:15.384 --> 12:17.603
Sarah. Hey.

12:17.762 --> 12:19.605
I tried to call you last night.

12:19.847 --> 12:22.826
Yeah, I was... I was tired.
I had the machine on.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.619
So, wow, huh?

12:24.643 --> 12:26.987
How did it go? I was thinking
about you all night.

12:27.980 --> 12:29.907
It went okay.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.793
Really? Just okay?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.920
Because, I don't know,
it really seemed

12:33.944 --> 12:35.839
like you guys were connecting.

12:35.863 --> 12:37.841
What did you... What
did you talk about?

12:37.865 --> 12:39.958
You know, stuff.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.211
Stuff. Huh.

12:42.745 --> 12:45.015
So, was it kind of
how you expected it?

12:45.039 --> 12:47.549
You know, Bailey, I really don't
feel like blabbing about this.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.551
Oh, okay. I just...

12:50.419 --> 12:53.222
I just wanted to...
see how things went.

12:53.464 --> 12:55.609
Are you gonna... Are you gonna
get together again, maybe?

12:55.633 --> 12:56.902
Yeah, we are. We made plans.

12:56.926 --> 12:59.446
- Really? What are you gonna do?
- Bailey, they're our plans.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.281
Robin's and mine. In
fact, we're probably

13:01.305 --> 13:02.616
gonna be spending a
lot of time together.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.608
So, you're just gonna
have to get used to that.

13:05.601 --> 13:07.162
What are you doing?

13:07.186 --> 13:09.581
Sarah, what, are you...
Are you punishing me?

13:09.605 --> 13:11.833
You're mad at me, so you're shutting
me out? Is that what you're doing?

13:11.857 --> 13:14.336
Look, Bailey, you have stuff
in your life that's private.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.869
Now I do too. What's
wrong with that?

13:19.073 --> 13:20.550
You know, I was just thinking

13:20.574 --> 13:22.928
how depressing it's
gotta be for him.

13:22.952 --> 13:25.796
You know, to go home every
day to a lonely hotel room

13:25.913 --> 13:28.757
and some dinky little fridge,

13:28.791 --> 13:31.677
TV remote nailed to
the night table.

13:32.420 --> 13:35.148
When he could be staying
in a real house

13:35.172 --> 13:36.733
with his family.

13:36.757 --> 13:37.943
Look, Claud, since
he hasn't asked,

13:37.967 --> 13:39.945
I really don't see the
point in offering.

13:39.969 --> 13:41.988
Yeah, but... You
know, I was thinking

13:42.012 --> 13:44.116
it would be nice for us
too, to have him around.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.535
I mean, to have him right
there, all the time.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.078
Have who right where
all the time?

13:48.102 --> 13:50.279
- Grandpa.
- What about him?

13:50.479 --> 13:52.322
Claudia wants him to move in.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.991
Really?

13:54.066 --> 13:56.044
Move in with us? Really?

13:56.068 --> 13:58.130
- I'm thinking no.
- What are you worried about?

13:58.154 --> 14:00.465
I mean, he's gonna
steal the silver?

14:00.489 --> 14:02.676
No. I just think we should
all give it some time.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.011
I mean, technically,
yes, he's our family

14:05.035 --> 14:07.264
but he's... he's
also a stranger.

14:07.288 --> 14:09.850
- But he's trying not to be.
- He's right, Claud.

14:09.874 --> 14:12.144
He's right. It's too soon. We
should give it some more time.

14:12.168 --> 14:13.844
So, how long do we wait?

14:14.128 --> 14:16.481
I mean, you really think
we're gonna get close to him

14:16.505 --> 14:20.402
by seeing him a few times a week, all
dressed up, and on our best behavior?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.529
You think that one
day, all of a sudden,

14:22.553 --> 14:25.532
he's just gonna feel like
he's really our grandfather,

14:25.556 --> 14:27.242
and that's when we
give him the key?

14:27.266 --> 14:30.569
Claud, I'm not talking
about waiting a year.

14:30.644 --> 14:33.039
- I'm just saying...
- Why wait at all? What for?

14:33.063 --> 14:36.408
He's here, and he wants to
be a part of our lives.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.993
And you know what?

14:38.027 --> 14:39.171
He's not so young.

14:39.195 --> 14:42.414
I mean, what if
something happens?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.501
What if something happens before

14:46.243 --> 14:48.587
we really get a
chance to love him?

14:52.708 --> 14:54.519
These are so lovely. Thank you.

14:54.543 --> 14:57.063
You're welcome. Yeah, is
it okay that I'm here?

14:57.087 --> 14:58.523
I mean, do you need to
get ready or anything?

14:58.547 --> 15:01.276
Oh, no. No, it's really
nice that you're here.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.321
You know, there's this other
gal in the show. Big diva.

15:04.345 --> 15:05.989
I mean, God help
anybody who knocks

15:06.013 --> 15:08.742
on her dressing room door
while she's preparing.

15:08.766 --> 15:10.285
I don't know. I
just go on stage.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.454
I turn it on. Come
off, turn it off.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.289
I know. I know. I do
that, too, with singing.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.541
You know, no big process.
I just kind of do it.

15:16.565 --> 15:17.667
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

15:17.691 --> 15:18.960
Yep.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.338
I'm really glad I'm getting
to see this before it closes.

15:21.362 --> 15:23.632
So, do you have to look
for another job now?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.759
Nope. Thankfully, the
producers like me enough

15:25.783 --> 15:27.260
to keep me for the tour.

15:27.284 --> 15:29.304
So, I will be dying
across America

15:29.328 --> 15:30.931
for the next six
to eight months.

15:30.955 --> 15:33.433
Oh, God! I just gave away the ending.
I'm sorry.

15:33.457 --> 15:36.853
Sorry. Anyway, it's
a big break for me.

15:36.877 --> 15:40.264
Thank God I won't have to be
auditioning all the time and...

15:40.881 --> 15:42.349
What?

15:42.591 --> 15:44.101
What is it?

15:44.885 --> 15:46.321
You're leaving?

15:46.345 --> 15:50.149
Well, not permanently. But
for a little while, yeah.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.619
You know what? I'll
give you my itinerary.

15:52.643 --> 15:54.454
Maybe we can do the pen pal bit.

15:54.478 --> 15:55.831
I don't... I don't understand.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.198
Why would come looking for me
if you were planning to leave?

15:59.859 --> 16:01.285
What...

16:01.777 --> 16:04.079
Well, I just... I
just thought...

16:05.364 --> 16:07.384
We've made a great start, Sarah.

16:07.408 --> 16:11.128
So it's not like we're gonna have to
begin all over again when I get back.

16:11.495 --> 16:13.640
And, you know, to
tell you the truth,

16:13.664 --> 16:17.143
it made it a lot easier for me
to know that you were out there

16:17.167 --> 16:20.095
and wondering about us,
and wanting us to meet.

16:20.629 --> 16:22.097
Wait, you knew?

16:22.298 --> 16:24.016
Yeah. From Bailey.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.652
- At the coffeehouse?
- No.

16:25.676 --> 16:27.686
He tracked me down
about a month ago.

16:27.761 --> 16:29.990
And I am so glad he did. I am.

16:30.014 --> 16:33.567
Because I think it feels right that
we should be friends, don't you?

16:34.435 --> 16:35.986
Yeah.

16:36.729 --> 16:40.157
Yeah. Well, I should
let you get dressed.

16:42.735 --> 16:47.090
Oh, I'm sorry. I assumed that you'd
all talk this over together.

16:47.114 --> 16:50.209
Well, we didn't. No one
said a word to me.

16:50.284 --> 16:55.380
Because I wouldn't have just
barged over here like this...

16:57.958 --> 17:00.645
I better just go check
back into the hotel, huh?

17:00.669 --> 17:02.063
- Yeah.
- Yes.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.348
Yeah, I think that would
be a really good idea.

17:04.964 --> 17:06.892
It was my mistake.

17:07.926 --> 17:10.479
Just tell your sister I'll
call her from the hotel.

17:15.142 --> 17:16.568
Claudia!

17:16.935 --> 17:18.079
Claudia!

17:18.103 --> 17:19.748
What, are you, like,
on fire or something?

17:19.771 --> 17:21.625
Did you tell Jake that
he could live with us?

17:21.648 --> 17:23.877
Yeah. Why? Why, is he here?

17:23.901 --> 17:25.587
No, he is not here.
I sent him away.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.213
He is not moving in with us.

17:27.237 --> 17:28.548
Charlie and Bailey
said it was okay.

17:28.571 --> 17:30.717
- I don't care!
- I don't have to listen to you.

17:30.741 --> 17:33.053
You don't get to decide. Three to one.
You lose.

17:33.077 --> 17:36.139
What is the matter with you?
Why are you being nice to him?

17:36.163 --> 17:39.091
- Because he's my grandfather.
- No! He is not!

17:39.249 --> 17:40.685
He is nothing to you!

17:40.709 --> 17:43.355
He... He is just the man
who ran out on Mom.

17:43.379 --> 17:45.774
So you're just gonna forgive him for that?
Is that it?

17:45.798 --> 17:48.818
- I didn't... - God! What gives you
the right to forgive him for her?

17:48.842 --> 17:51.571
- Julia... - Do you have any idea
what it was like for her? Do you?

17:51.595 --> 17:53.615
Did she ever tell you
what it was like?

17:53.639 --> 17:56.034
- No.
- Well, she told me.

17:56.058 --> 17:59.829
She told me what it was like to have him
leave her without a goodbye or a note.

17:59.853 --> 18:02.040
Without ever calling to say once

18:02.064 --> 18:04.491
that he loved her or
thought about her.

18:04.650 --> 18:07.119
And what it was like to think
that that was her fault.

18:07.194 --> 18:08.662
And you.

18:08.862 --> 18:10.966
Just because you want someone
to take you for ice cream

18:10.990 --> 18:13.843
or to some stupid swap meet.
I can't believe you!

18:13.867 --> 18:15.470
I can't believe how
selfish you are!

18:15.494 --> 18:18.098
Why don't you just go to the
cemetery and spit on Mom's grave?

18:18.122 --> 18:20.841
- Julia, that is... - 'Cause
that is what you're doing!

18:26.505 --> 18:27.899
Come on. You're kidding, right?

18:27.923 --> 18:30.694
Why on earth would anyone
hate foreign films?

18:30.718 --> 18:33.863
- Um... subtitles?
- Oh...

18:33.887 --> 18:36.616
Look, it's got great reviews.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.785
And believe me, Charlie,
when you see this woman,

18:38.809 --> 18:40.620
you won't care that
there are subtitles.

18:40.644 --> 18:42.946
Now, go get in line.
I'll get the tickets.

18:46.608 --> 18:49.578
- Charlie!
- Oh, hi.

18:49.987 --> 18:52.289
Hey, hello. Hi.

18:52.364 --> 18:53.957
Hi.

18:54.283 --> 18:55.792
Are you, uh...?

18:57.953 --> 19:01.474
- Are you here alone?
- What? Alo... No. Um...

19:01.498 --> 19:04.352
Actually, I'm here with, um...
that... that woman,

19:04.376 --> 19:06.970
you know, the... the
birthday that I catered?

19:07.004 --> 19:09.482
That woman. It's sort
of a business thing.

19:09.506 --> 19:11.776
She... She wants me
to do another party.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.612
And she was thinking, like, this...
this Italian theme,

19:14.636 --> 19:18.482
because, uh... because
her fiancée is Italian.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.693
From Italy. Roberto.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.538
Oh, really? She's engaged?

19:23.562 --> 19:25.415
Yeah. Didn't I mention that?

19:25.439 --> 19:27.959
Yeah, it's an engagement
party that she's planning.

19:27.983 --> 19:30.962
And it's, um... It's a lot of
business riding on it for me.

19:30.986 --> 19:33.288
- I really couldn't say no.
- They're sold out.

19:33.530 --> 19:35.508
I know. You're devastated.

19:35.532 --> 19:37.042
Good thing I got here early.

19:37.076 --> 19:41.630
Hi. Emily. I think
maybe we met before.

19:41.997 --> 19:44.257
Anyway, congratulations.

19:44.666 --> 19:46.186
Charlie told me.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.970
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

19:50.130 --> 19:51.640
Anyway, uh...

19:51.715 --> 19:53.651
Well, if they're...
If they're sold out,

19:53.675 --> 19:55.685
then, uh, we should
probably get going.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.312
Yeah.

19:57.513 --> 19:59.898
It looks like you're going in.

20:00.307 --> 20:03.610
Oh. Yeah. I guess I should.

20:07.648 --> 20:10.033
- She's an old friend.
- Hmm.

20:13.195 --> 20:14.830
Jacob Gordon, please.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.957
Oh, he's not?

20:18.033 --> 20:21.086
Yes, this is Claudia Salinger.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.631
Tell him...

20:26.458 --> 20:29.312
Tell him that I'm not gonna be
able to get together tomorrow

20:29.336 --> 20:31.221
like we planned.

20:32.214 --> 20:35.308
No, he doesn't
have to call back.

20:38.053 --> 20:40.439
Tell him not to call back.

20:40.556 --> 20:42.023
Thank you.

20:45.519 --> 20:47.904
- Oh, hey! I didn't expect...
- You know what? I would

20:47.938 --> 20:50.250
I would really... I would
really like to know

20:50.274 --> 20:52.585
why you think it's okay to
lie to me about everything.

20:52.609 --> 20:54.671
Why is it okay to
treat me that way?

20:54.695 --> 20:56.506
- What?
- You saw her, Bailey.

20:56.530 --> 20:59.175
A month ago. You saw my mother,
and you never told me.

20:59.199 --> 21:01.845
- Sarah, listen... - And it's like
every day a new lie with you.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.462
Sarah, come on. What...

21:03.829 --> 21:06.182
What was I supposed to do? Huh?

21:06.206 --> 21:07.767
She said she didn't wanna see you.
Was I...

21:07.791 --> 21:10.010
Was I really supposed to
come home and tell you that?

21:10.335 --> 21:11.980
You can be mad at me
about a lot of things,

21:12.004 --> 21:14.941
but you cannot be mad at me about that.
You can't.

21:14.965 --> 21:17.392
You just... you just can't.

21:22.556 --> 21:23.982
What?

21:24.766 --> 21:26.401
She's going away.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.236
What?

21:29.271 --> 21:32.491
In two days she's going on
tour for a longer time.

21:33.442 --> 21:36.203
I don't know. I'll probably
never see her again.

21:38.363 --> 21:40.916
I didn't... I didn't know that.

21:42.242 --> 21:44.419
And I'm so angry

21:44.494 --> 21:47.172
at myself for being surprised.

21:48.081 --> 21:51.551
Why... Why am I surprised
that people leave?

21:52.336 --> 21:55.639
'Cause... 'Cause
that's what people do.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.267
You know, people leave, right?

22:03.597 --> 22:06.233
I gotta be more careful.
Remind me of that, okay?

22:22.991 --> 22:25.637
- Hi. Are you waiting for me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I was.

22:25.661 --> 22:28.431
Because I wanna know what
the hell you're doing.

22:28.455 --> 22:31.351
Showing up one day, and
then taking off the next.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.051
- Excuse me?
- So... So, what?

22:33.085 --> 22:35.146
You met her, right? You got
her out of your system

22:35.170 --> 22:37.398
- and now you're gonna walk away.
- Oh, God. All right.

22:37.422 --> 22:39.943
First of all, you are
way out of line, kiddo.

22:39.967 --> 22:43.237
And second of all, I'm not walking away.
I'm taking a job.

22:43.261 --> 22:44.989
Yeah, well, that's not
how Sarah sees it.

22:45.013 --> 22:46.532
- Well, that's too bad.
- Yeah, it is.

22:46.556 --> 22:50.402
You know what? I don't have
to explain myself to you.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.416
Look, I... I came to see her

22:55.440 --> 22:58.252
to see what she looks like,
and to know that she's okay.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.046
And to let her do the same thing with me.
And that's it.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.839
Well, you picked a
great time to do it.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.623
Two days before
you're leaving town?

23:03.657 --> 23:05.301
It's like you're walking
out on her all over again.

23:05.325 --> 23:06.803
- I am not...
- And you know what?

23:06.827 --> 23:10.130
And this is the incredible part. I'm
the one who's getting blamed for it.

23:11.206 --> 23:12.600
What are you talking about?

23:12.624 --> 23:15.478
All I wanna do is go away to college.
That is it.

23:15.502 --> 23:18.398
And that is not so much to want, right?
People do that all the time.

23:18.422 --> 23:20.650
And I've been counting
on this for so long.

23:20.674 --> 23:22.318
Only now, with you
skipping out on her...

23:22.342 --> 23:24.696
Is that why you're here?
That's what your problem is.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.905
- No.
- I get it. Now I get it.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.564
No, you don't!

23:28.015 --> 23:29.858
I am here because of Sarah.

23:30.183 --> 23:33.454
Because... Because
it is so unfair

23:33.478 --> 23:35.081
to just come walking
into somebody's life

23:35.105 --> 23:37.417
without even thinking about
what you might mean to them,

23:37.441 --> 23:40.493
or what it might mean to them
when you just walk away.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.497
Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't
make her any promises.

23:44.781 --> 23:46.207
Did you?

23:57.002 --> 23:59.981
Claudia seems more focused,
more conscientious.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.358
Her problem-solving
skills seem sharper.

24:02.382 --> 24:05.153
Great. How late do you think
you'll have to be here?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.395
She's maintaining
an A-minus average.

24:07.429 --> 24:09.407
Because I thought maybe we
could get a bite or something.

24:09.431 --> 24:12.827
And aside from a few late
homework assignments,

24:12.851 --> 24:14.861
there's really nothing
else to report.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.041
- Emily. - So, we can do this
again in a couple of months.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.501
Emily! Enough with the
professional stuff.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.202
Aside from that,

24:22.819 --> 24:24.996
I never wanna see you again.

24:25.947 --> 24:27.582
What?

24:27.783 --> 24:29.135
You think I'm stupid?

24:29.159 --> 24:33.681
I saw that woman touch you
and straighten your collar.

24:33.705 --> 24:37.384
And I'm sorry, but you don't do this...
to your caterer.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.637
Oh, God.

24:43.048 --> 24:44.641
Can I explain?

24:44.925 --> 24:45.943
Will you let me?

24:45.967 --> 24:47.361
Sure. If you have
something to say

24:47.385 --> 24:49.521
that's gonna make a
difference, you tell me.

24:56.686 --> 24:58.113
Right.

24:58.605 --> 25:00.031
Emily.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.742
I was so careful
not to get hurt.

25:02.859 --> 25:06.089
But, uh, what are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do, you know,

25:06.113 --> 25:07.632
when you start to feel
something for somebody?

25:07.656 --> 25:09.165
You gotta take a chance.

25:11.535 --> 25:16.172
You have to admit, it's kind of
a sick joke that this happened

25:16.665 --> 25:19.092
the day after I slept with you.

25:20.085 --> 25:23.147
Anyway, um... I made
it a rule not to cry

25:23.171 --> 25:26.057
at parent-teacher conferences,
so just get out of here, okay?

25:33.890 --> 25:35.316
I'm sorry.

25:36.143 --> 25:39.571
I never... I didn't mean
for this to happen.

25:39.646 --> 25:41.948
I swear. And...

25:42.774 --> 25:45.535
I know it doesn't
seem that way, but...

25:45.694 --> 25:47.620
You could, um,

25:48.947 --> 25:51.291
be a little more careful
of people, you know?

25:53.869 --> 25:56.296
You could have been a
little careful of me.

25:59.958 --> 26:02.145
Am I doing something
that is so terrible?

26:02.169 --> 26:05.180
- No.
- No, I know I'm not.

26:05.505 --> 26:07.348
You don't even have to answer that.
I know I'm not.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.026
Okay, then.

26:09.050 --> 26:11.154
Only now, I'm just
the next person

26:11.178 --> 26:12.896
waiting in line to
disappoint her.

26:13.346 --> 26:14.949
And I really don't
wanna do that.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.900
So I'm, like, I'm trapped.

26:17.726 --> 26:19.912
And it just... It
just feels like

26:19.936 --> 26:21.654
that's how it's always been.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.324
You know, and how
it's always gonna be.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.378
Whenever I want
something for myself,

26:27.402 --> 26:30.163
there's always somebody else
that I gotta take care of first.

26:30.572 --> 26:33.166
Owen or Claudia.

26:33.658 --> 26:35.126
Or Sarah.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.722
Well, it's your life, Bay.

26:37.746 --> 26:39.932
You're allowed to be a little
bit selfish sometimes.

26:39.956 --> 26:41.382
Right.

26:41.583 --> 26:42.967
Right.

26:43.376 --> 26:46.095
It's unbelievable, huh?

26:46.630 --> 26:48.723
The one time that I get a break.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.568
Some jerk in the
Admissions office

26:50.592 --> 26:52.862
probably lost his eyeglasses.

26:52.886 --> 26:55.230
Misread my transcript.
And I get in.

26:55.472 --> 26:58.191
And it's the best thing that has
ever happened to me in my life.

27:01.144 --> 27:03.112
Maybe it's the second best.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.366
Maybe Sarah's the best.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.119
Ah, whatever I choose...

27:12.781 --> 27:14.249
What a mess.

27:16.618 --> 27:19.462
Just so you know, we had a pop quiz
in Miss Schrader's class today.

27:19.996 --> 27:21.265
It was the first pop quiz we had

27:21.289 --> 27:23.059
since the last time
you guys had a fight.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.593
So, all I'd like to know is,
what'd you do this time?

27:25.794 --> 27:27.146
Um, Claudia, you know what?

27:27.170 --> 27:28.814
I'm not so sure that
now is the time to...

27:28.838 --> 27:30.723
She found out, didn't she?

27:31.091 --> 27:34.185
- About bachelorette number two?
- Hey, that is none of your...

27:36.471 --> 27:37.689
Yeah.

27:38.932 --> 27:41.568
- She kind of did.
- I knew it.

27:42.435 --> 27:43.746
Listen, I was gonna
talk to you about it...

27:43.770 --> 27:45.363
Save it, Charlie.

27:45.981 --> 27:47.657
People don't change.

27:47.774 --> 27:49.252
And given your record,
it was my fault

27:49.276 --> 27:51.953
for thinking you'd do
anything but screw up.

27:52.279 --> 27:55.540
It's my fault for thinking much more
of a lot of people in this family.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.836
It's, like, I wish
that just once

28:01.788 --> 28:03.756
you'd surprise me.

28:07.002 --> 28:08.729
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

28:08.753 --> 28:10.305
Bye.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.980
Could you move, please?

28:20.724 --> 28:23.735
It's gonna be pretty hard to see out the
windshield with me up here like this.

28:24.102 --> 28:25.913
Look, Bailey, it's been
a really long night.

28:25.937 --> 28:28.031
I'm exhausted, and I
just wanna go home.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.543
Sarah.

28:30.567 --> 28:32.410
Sarah, wait. Wait a second.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.415
I've been thinking, and...

28:38.533 --> 28:40.168
And I'm not gonna go.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.003
I won't go.

28:42.579 --> 28:44.005
You won't?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.716
It's freezing there
this time of year.

28:48.001 --> 28:49.552
Who needs that?

29:02.098 --> 29:04.233
- I can't tell you that.
- What?

29:04.517 --> 29:06.903
No, no, no.

29:27.248 --> 29:28.841
Come on, Thurber.

29:29.209 --> 29:30.686
Thurber, you lazy
good for nothing.

29:30.710 --> 29:32.521
Okay. Fine, that's it.

29:32.545 --> 29:33.731
Thurber.

29:33.755 --> 29:36.015
That's it! I'm going myself.

29:37.967 --> 29:39.278
What are you...

29:39.302 --> 29:41.187
What is this? What
are you doing here?

29:41.471 --> 29:43.648
Uh, this is a...

29:44.808 --> 29:46.744
A letter that I've
written to all of you,

29:46.768 --> 29:49.821
explaining why I'm
headed out of town.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.739
Right.

29:51.856 --> 29:54.492
There's not much
point in staying.

29:54.901 --> 29:58.287
Doesn't seem to be a
future for all of us.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.832
No. I think that's right.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.753
This is my old... My
old pocket watch.

30:06.621 --> 30:09.924
I used to tell your mother
that this had magical powers.

30:10.125 --> 30:14.387
And, uh, she'd swing it back
and forth in front of my eyes,

30:14.629 --> 30:17.056
pretending that she
was hypnotizing me.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.528
I was going to leave it for her,

30:20.552 --> 30:22.363
and I don't know why I didn't.

30:22.387 --> 30:25.991
And then, over the years, I
was going to send it back.

30:26.015 --> 30:28.661
But every time I'd sit
down to write a letter,

30:28.685 --> 30:32.196
I'd get as far as, "Dear
Diana," and then I...

30:33.440 --> 30:35.324
I'd like you to have it.

30:37.861 --> 30:39.454
I don't want it.

30:39.738 --> 30:40.798
Oh, please.

30:40.822 --> 30:43.426
I don't want things from you.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.544
- We're family.
- I don't care.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.641
We don't have that many
people besides each other.

30:50.665 --> 30:52.467
I don't care.

30:53.543 --> 30:55.344
Someday you will.

30:56.629 --> 31:00.183
Someday you're gonna
care very much.

31:00.842 --> 31:03.186
And it may be too late.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.064
You wanna avoid that

31:06.931 --> 31:08.242
at all costs.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.026
At all costs.

31:11.561 --> 31:14.530
You wanna avoid letting
it be too late.

31:16.983 --> 31:20.495
You waited thirty years. I
don't feel sorry for you.

31:22.155 --> 31:24.457
I feel sorry for my Mom.

31:24.616 --> 31:28.795
And I feel sorry for me, because
I should have had a grandfather.

31:29.537 --> 31:31.214
I want to try.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.096
I want to try with you,
Julia because you...

31:38.546 --> 31:40.848
Well, standing there, you...

31:41.132 --> 31:42.892
You're just like your mother.

31:44.177 --> 31:46.646
I'm as close as I'll ever be

31:47.388 --> 31:49.607
to seeing her again.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.194
Please?

32:01.277 --> 32:03.371
Okay. Okay.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.373
I'm just trying to...

32:05.406 --> 32:07.092
I wanna... I wanna be
really clear here.

32:07.116 --> 32:10.387
I wanna know exactly what you mean by...
by "an old friend."

32:10.411 --> 32:12.473
Jared got me started
in the news business

32:12.497 --> 32:14.642
before he moved
over to corporate.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.269
He and I see each other whenever
we're in each other's cities.

32:17.293 --> 32:18.562
See each other how?

32:18.586 --> 32:19.855
Because it sure as
hell didn't seem like

32:19.879 --> 32:21.941
you were talking shop
downstairs just now.

32:21.965 --> 32:24.193
Well, what do you want
me to say, Charlie?

32:24.217 --> 32:26.403
Oh. I'm sorry you saw that.

32:26.427 --> 32:28.239
It certainly wasn't my intention

32:28.263 --> 32:30.991
to wave Jared's and my
relationship in your face.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.243
Let me understand this.

32:32.267 --> 32:34.787
You're sorry not that you're
sleeping with another guy,

32:34.811 --> 32:36.497
but that I found out about it?

32:36.521 --> 32:39.208
Please don't take the moral
high ground here, Charlie,

32:39.232 --> 32:41.544
because, trust me, you'll lose.

32:41.568 --> 32:43.003
And what's that
supposed to mean?

32:43.027 --> 32:46.581
It means, I know about you
and your little friend.

32:47.365 --> 32:50.293
Irma, Emma, Emily?

32:52.453 --> 32:54.046
Well...

32:54.581 --> 32:56.809
I... You...

32:56.833 --> 32:58.811
That... that's over.

32:58.835 --> 33:00.938
And I assume you broke it off

33:00.962 --> 33:03.347
because you saw the
error of your ways?

33:04.966 --> 33:06.318
Guess not.

33:06.342 --> 33:08.644
Guess she found out and
ended it first, huh?

33:10.680 --> 33:12.148
Your turn.

33:12.473 --> 33:13.858
Okay.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.361
Yes, look. I... I didn't
handle that well.

33:17.395 --> 33:19.331
And I'm not saying that
what I did was right.

33:19.355 --> 33:21.584
It wasn't right. It was wrong.
And...

33:21.608 --> 33:24.035
But the truth is...

33:24.319 --> 33:26.495
The... the difference is...

33:26.696 --> 33:27.715
The difference is...

33:27.739 --> 33:30.384
Yes, tell me what the
difference is, Charlie.

33:30.408 --> 33:31.959
Well...

33:31.993 --> 33:34.712
The difference is, is
that I feel bad about it.

33:34.996 --> 33:37.590
And obviously, Kathleen,
you don't give a damn.

33:42.503 --> 33:45.357
"'Excellent', said Mr.
Lion, who was perched

33:45.381 --> 33:48.736
atop the toy chest with the
other stuffed animals.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.655
'I've also taught
you how to roar."'

33:51.679 --> 33:53.481
Yay!

33:54.057 --> 33:56.734
- That was a good one, eh, Owen?
- Yeah.

33:56.851 --> 33:58.537
Let's try some other
form of amusement.

33:58.561 --> 34:00.623
- What about the slide?
- The slide.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.500
There we are. It's a long
time since I did any of that.

34:03.524 --> 34:05.878
Well, I'm gonna put some tea on.
You want some?

34:05.902 --> 34:07.171
Yes, I'd love some tea,

34:07.195 --> 34:10.007
as long as it isn't any of
that sissified herbal stuff.

34:10.031 --> 34:11.550
Okay, you got it.

34:11.574 --> 34:13.876
Who uses this? You or Charlie?

34:17.288 --> 34:19.130
I don't believe you.

34:19.456 --> 34:21.060
I don't believe you're
sitting out there with him,

34:21.083 --> 34:23.145
all friendly and kissy-kissy
and everything.

34:23.168 --> 34:25.481
I mean, after what you
said to me about Mom?

34:25.505 --> 34:26.607
Claudia...

34:26.630 --> 34:29.318
So, it's like I'm evil for even
talking to him, but you're allowed

34:29.342 --> 34:31.362
to just change your mind. All of
a sudden, he's your best friend.

34:31.386 --> 34:33.489
No, that's not it. Look,
Claud, I'm sorry.

34:33.513 --> 34:35.648
Is that why you said
that stuff to me?

34:36.391 --> 34:38.452
Just so you could have
him all to yourself?

34:38.476 --> 34:40.120
- No.
- Then how come all of a sudden

34:40.143 --> 34:41.705
you don't care about
Mom's feelings?

34:41.728 --> 34:44.208
No, I do. I do, Claudia.

34:44.232 --> 34:47.368
- Then why is he here?
- Because...

34:47.694 --> 34:49.996
Because...

34:54.492 --> 34:58.587
I've been trying to figure out
what she would have done.

34:58.830 --> 35:02.977
I mean, what she would have done
if one day she opened the door,

35:03.001 --> 35:05.521
and there he was,
standing on the doorstep,

35:05.545 --> 35:07.722
wanting so badly to apologize.

35:10.258 --> 35:14.238
And the thing is... he
hurt her so much, Claudia,

35:14.262 --> 35:16.355
that she wouldn't
have forgiven him.

35:16.389 --> 35:17.700
Well, then, why would you?

35:17.724 --> 35:19.775
But I think she might
have been holding Owen,

35:20.518 --> 35:22.913
or maybe you would have been
practicing in the living room,

35:22.937 --> 35:26.500
or I would've been doing
my homework on the stairs,

35:26.524 --> 35:28.242
like I used to.

35:29.402 --> 35:31.203
And she would have
thought of us.

35:32.947 --> 35:35.509
And she would have said to him,

35:35.533 --> 35:38.336
"It's too late for
the two of us.

35:40.413 --> 35:43.225
But you know what? I
have five children.

35:43.249 --> 35:46.844
And maybe you can mean
something to them."

35:50.214 --> 35:52.693
Don't you think she
might have said that?

35:52.717 --> 35:56.354
I mean, doesn't that sound like
something she might have said?

36:04.896 --> 36:07.166
Well, maybe this is too
big of an imposition.

36:07.190 --> 36:08.667
I don't know. I mean,
you tell me if it is.

36:08.691 --> 36:11.712
But, um... Amanda just
hates traveling with me.

36:11.736 --> 36:14.506
I mean, stuck in that box
all day, who can blame her?

36:14.530 --> 36:16.884
So, I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

36:16.908 --> 36:18.302
keeping an eye on her?

36:18.326 --> 36:20.086
I mean, while I'm gone.

36:20.119 --> 36:21.962
You're giving me a cat?

36:22.246 --> 36:24.767
Just lending, actually.

36:24.791 --> 36:25.934
Oh.

36:25.958 --> 36:27.561
Oh, okay, so I guess
this is kind of like

36:27.585 --> 36:29.980
a consolation prize, right?

36:30.004 --> 36:32.608
- Lose a mother, gain a pet.
- Hey.

36:32.632 --> 36:34.193
No, I mean, I guess I
should feel grateful.

36:34.217 --> 36:35.778
You know, it's a guarantee
that you'll come back.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.561
After all, you love your cat.

36:41.516 --> 36:43.567
What do you want from me, Sarah?

36:44.727 --> 36:46.237
I don't know.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.531
Something.

36:49.357 --> 36:50.667
I wanna know that
you care enough

36:50.691 --> 36:53.828
not to just disappear when
we're getting started.

36:53.861 --> 36:55.464
I wanna know that
I matter to you.

36:55.488 --> 36:58.133
And the only way I can prove
that to you is by staying?

36:58.157 --> 37:00.427
You can't make rules like that.

37:00.451 --> 37:01.845
Why? Why can't I?

37:01.869 --> 37:04.348
Because it's not fair.
That's why.

37:04.372 --> 37:06.725
You know, you just can't dictate
what we're gonna mean to each other.

37:06.749 --> 37:09.135
You have to let what's
gonna happen just happen.

37:09.335 --> 37:11.178
Yeah. What if this is it?

37:11.462 --> 37:13.889
I mean, what if this is
as close as we ever get?

37:14.257 --> 37:16.819
Well, I... I can't
promise, Sarah.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.362
I mean, I don't know
what's gonna be.

37:18.386 --> 37:20.823
But, you know, you gotta trust

37:20.847 --> 37:22.866
that all the ways
that we're alike,

37:22.890 --> 37:25.369
and all the things
that connect us,

37:25.393 --> 37:27.746
means that our relationship isn't
as fragile as you think it is.

37:27.770 --> 37:31.031
It's not gonna disappear
over Poughkeepsie.

37:32.108 --> 37:33.544
How you know that for sure?

37:33.568 --> 37:35.911
Well, I don't know.

37:36.362 --> 37:39.007
But you see, Sarah,
I'm okay with leaving

37:39.031 --> 37:41.292
because I know I'm coming back.

37:43.911 --> 37:46.130
Gotta have a little
faith, Sarah.

37:57.925 --> 37:59.361
I don't know how Bay managed it.

37:59.385 --> 38:02.698
'Cause she was dating Will, but
then he got her back and all.

38:02.722 --> 38:05.701
Julia and Justin, they were,
like, so mad at each other.

38:05.725 --> 38:07.244
Then, all of a sudden,
they were just, like...

38:07.268 --> 38:10.738
I mean, like this... You have to
pry them apart with a crowbar.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.418
Uh, I'm with the
family historian here.

38:14.442 --> 38:17.296
Ah, you mention how many times
you've been grounded lately,

38:17.320 --> 38:20.048
or did you conveniently leave
that part of the update out?

38:20.072 --> 38:22.426
Hey. My life is an open book.

38:22.450 --> 38:24.001
- Yeah.
- Well...

38:24.535 --> 38:26.471
Wait a minute. Where are
you going with that?

38:26.495 --> 38:28.849
Well, I was just gonna get it out of
your way. Take it down to the basement.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.434
Well, it isn't in my way.

38:30.458 --> 38:33.020
I think we ought to leave
it here for the time being.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.981
- Why, you going somewhere?
- You only just got here.

38:36.005 --> 38:38.233
Well, I will be
going out of town

38:38.257 --> 38:40.444
for a couple of days
every now and then.

38:40.468 --> 38:44.522
You know, I've got a lot of business
concerns in a lot of places.

38:44.555 --> 38:47.743
In fact, next week, I'm gonna
have to go to Phoenix.

38:47.767 --> 38:51.413
For how long? I mean...
you're coming back, right?

38:51.437 --> 38:54.031
Oh, I'll be back. I promise.

38:54.482 --> 38:57.002
And while I'm gone,

38:57.026 --> 39:00.538
I want you to take
care of this for me.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.549
I don't like to travel with it.

39:02.573 --> 39:05.334
It's got a lot of
valuable stuff in it.

39:05.785 --> 39:08.180
- What's this?
- That's a medal.

39:08.204 --> 39:11.558
Got it in World War II. I
got that for being wounded.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.384
Caught a piece of shrapnel.

39:13.876 --> 39:16.220
Cool. Got a scar?

39:16.837 --> 39:19.066
Sure I've got a scar.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.685
- You have two wedding bands.
- Huh? What?

39:23.469 --> 39:25.239
Two wedding bands?

39:25.263 --> 39:28.232
Oh, yeah. Well, I'll
tell you about those.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.527
Once I thought that
I'd lost mine.

39:31.852 --> 39:33.956
And I was so afraid
that your grandmother

39:33.980 --> 39:35.958
would have a fit
when she found out,

39:35.982 --> 39:38.450
that I went out and I
bought another one.

39:40.528 --> 39:42.422
You know what you
could do with that?

39:42.446 --> 39:45.874
I've seen people wear them
on a chain around the neck.

39:46.617 --> 39:47.960
Really?

39:48.327 --> 39:49.962
Really.

39:50.246 --> 39:52.256
Cool.

39:57.044 --> 39:58.762
I, uh, can't stay.

39:58.963 --> 40:02.266
Okay. Well, uh, thanks
so much for stopping by.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.823
Here's the thing you
should know about me.

40:07.847 --> 40:10.065
I generally like to
keep my options open.

40:10.808 --> 40:11.994
Yeah, no kidding.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.162
I haven't had many big
relationships, Charlie,

40:14.186 --> 40:15.738
just lots of little ones.

40:16.897 --> 40:18.991
Hey, I know the type.

40:19.900 --> 40:22.796
Fill up on appetizers 'cause you don't
like the looks of the main course.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.872
God, please don't be glib.

40:29.952 --> 40:32.129
I don't wanna not give a damn.

40:33.622 --> 40:35.591
I mean...

40:35.750 --> 40:38.719
I don't wanna be the kind of
person who doesn't give a damn.

40:38.753 --> 40:40.929
I mean, I could give a damn.

40:42.214 --> 40:44.850
I mean, I do

40:46.594 --> 40:48.562
give a damn.

40:49.972 --> 40:51.357
About you.

40:51.766 --> 40:53.067
Yeah?

40:53.225 --> 40:55.027
Yeah.

40:57.605 --> 40:59.406
So, uh...

41:00.232 --> 41:04.453
What I was thinking is, and
this is just a suggestion,

41:05.696 --> 41:07.924
how about you give me
your little black book,

41:07.948 --> 41:10.292
and I give you mine,
and we just, sort of,

41:10.659 --> 41:12.211
see what happens?

41:22.088 --> 41:24.223
I meant that figuratively.

41:24.465 --> 41:25.942
You actually have a black book?

41:25.966 --> 41:28.111
Oh, no. Give that to me.

41:28.135 --> 41:29.895
Oh, no.

41:30.971 --> 41:33.399
- Wow.
- What?

41:33.516 --> 41:35.234
I don't even get a star?

41:41.190 --> 41:43.033
I can work on that.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.128
Did I say I can't stay?

41:54.912 --> 41:57.131
I... I can't stay.

41:58.165 --> 41:59.758
I'm going.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.511
I'm gone.

42:08.717 --> 42:11.103
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:11.679 --> 42:13.647
Application to State.

42:16.308 --> 42:19.027
"Choose one word that
best describes you."

42:19.478 --> 42:21.123
Hmm, I can think of a few.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.949
But I don't think they'd
help you get into colleges.

42:24.942 --> 42:26.744
Ha-ha.

42:27.319 --> 42:29.538
Hey, guess what. I got a cat.

42:30.072 --> 42:31.591
- You did?
- Yeah.

42:31.615 --> 42:34.793
It's kind of on a loan, actually.
It's Robin's.

42:37.913 --> 42:39.715
Can I see that?

42:40.666 --> 42:42.176
Yeah.

42:47.506 --> 42:49.776
Hey! What are you...
What are you doing?

42:49.800 --> 42:52.779
Look, you'll get one
of those parka things.
