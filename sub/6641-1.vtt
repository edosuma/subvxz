01:05.771 --> 01:08.205
Mom says we have to be polite
to her dates...

01:08.373 --> 01:11.069
and we will if he makes it to the door.

01:49.081 --> 01:52.608
- Merry Christmas, sucker.
- And don't come back for Kwanzaa.

01:53.085 --> 01:54.916
Think you're going out with our mama?

01:55.087 --> 01:56.918
I'm gonna get you two.

02:04.496 --> 02:07.158
Get me out of here!

02:10.901 --> 02:13.097
Lindsey, you really think Dad's
coming back?

02:13.271 --> 02:16.934
Any day now. But until then,
we have to keep Mom available.

02:17.209 --> 02:19.336
Problem is, she's just too pretty.

02:19.511 --> 02:21.775
That just makes our job
a whole lot tougher.

02:22.814 --> 02:25.112
Sometimes I feel sorry for her.

02:25.283 --> 02:29.413
Well, I feel sorry for the next sucker
who tries to put the moves on her.

02:42.167 --> 02:44.499
- Mr. Persons.
- My man.

02:44.669 --> 02:46.694
What you got for me?

02:59.518 --> 03:03.682
- I'll get the door for you.
- Got that new-car smell, you know?

03:04.589 --> 03:06.580
This puppy's missing one thing.

03:10.128 --> 03:13.757
Welcome to the big leagues, Satch.
Let's make it happen.

03:15.767 --> 03:19.828
Look at this ride. Parchment leather
with the satin nickel trim.

03:20.972 --> 03:24.669
Look out, ladies, here we come. Holla.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.988
Nick Persons. How's it going, man?

03:41.993 --> 03:43.858
How's it look?

03:57.876 --> 04:01.835
Keep driving, fool. That's the one
that sicced her dog on you.

04:19.531 --> 04:23.228
What? You want some of this, huh?
You want a piece of me?

04:40.485 --> 04:45.422
Oh, my goodness.
Six thousand pounds of respect.

04:45.590 --> 04:48.491
- Yeah. It's nice, huh?
- Yeah.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.991
- Take it for a spin?
- Yeah.

04:50.161 --> 04:51.822
I don't think so.

04:52.797 --> 04:57.029
- Man, what did that unit set you back?
- I got a good deal on it.

04:57.202 --> 04:59.796
Right. Your payments probably
cost more than my car.

04:59.971 --> 05:02.735
Marty, my shoes cost more than your car.

05:03.909 --> 05:06.275
Look, Nick, here come your
favorite customers.

05:06.444 --> 05:10.107
- Hey, mister, you got any Yu-Gi-Oh?
- What you think?

05:10.482 --> 05:12.074
You got any Dragon Ball GT?

05:12.284 --> 05:15.253
Look, you come in here every day
asking the same questions.

05:15.420 --> 05:20.119
We ain't got no Pokémon, no Digimon,
no Buffy, no SpongeBob...

05:20.292 --> 05:22.760
no Beanie Babies and no shoplifters.

05:22.928 --> 05:25.761
Now, get! Both of y'all, get!

05:31.036 --> 05:33.869
You better get.
You better get out of here.

05:35.006 --> 05:37.702
- You got a way with kids.
- They're like cockroaches...

05:37.876 --> 05:39.537
except you can't squish them.

05:41.846 --> 05:44.838
- You gonna clean that?
- I don't do windows.

05:45.283 --> 05:47.808
What? It’ll dry.

05:51.589 --> 05:54.558
People wanna know why I hate kids.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.516
What's the matter with you?

06:23.755 --> 06:27.589
- I think I'm in love.
- Love? No...

06:27.993 --> 06:30.587
What do you mean, love?

06:30.962 --> 06:34.921
Oh, yeah, that's the new girl from
the party-planning place. Yikes.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.930
- She's so fine.
- Yeah.

06:38.103 --> 06:40.333
- Man, I got to get with that.
- Whoa, whoa.

06:40.505 --> 06:41.767
She's a divorcée, man.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.272
That's way too much baggage
for a guy like you.

06:45.076 --> 06:47.408
Don't be so quick to judge people, man.

06:47.579 --> 06:49.740
This isn't the Nick the Quick that I know.

06:50.015 --> 06:52.540
- Hey, I had broccoli yesterday.
- So?

06:52.717 --> 06:55.845
Sometimes you got to try
something new, my friend.

06:56.021 --> 06:57.852
Look and learn.

07:15.874 --> 07:17.364
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom! Mom!

07:21.179 --> 07:23.374
- How was school?
- I got 100 on my test.

07:23.548 --> 07:25.812
- Big deal.
- Okay, all right.

07:25.984 --> 07:28.452
Who wants to go shoe shopping? Let's go.

07:33.224 --> 07:35.784
- What happened?
- Oh, man, she's a breeder.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.222
Two of them.

07:59.884 --> 08:01.146
Hey, wait!

08:01.319 --> 08:03.344
- Oh, no.
- Help!

08:03.521 --> 08:05.489
Do you have any jumper cables?

08:05.757 --> 08:08.021
No. No!

08:11.162 --> 08:13.926
Hey, Nick, don't do this.

08:14.099 --> 08:16.932
She's got two kids and a broken-down car.

08:17.102 --> 08:20.128
What's next? You gonna
ask her mama to move in with us?

08:29.180 --> 08:34.207
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
I've been standing out here forever.

08:37.222 --> 08:38.780
You know what?

08:38.957 --> 08:42.484
This might not be a good idea,
because we got rain, electricity.

08:42.659 --> 08:45.424
Oh, but I sure do appreciate it.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.230
Okay.

08:52.270 --> 08:56.001
You know, you look so familiar.

08:56.241 --> 08:58.141
Have we met before?

08:58.309 --> 09:01.403
Well, I'm Nick. I work right across
the street from you.

09:01.579 --> 09:05.879
Oh, that's right. You're the guy
that owns that cute little toy store.

09:06.451 --> 09:09.249
Fine sports collectibles.

09:09.420 --> 09:11.547
Fine sports collectibles.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.553
I'll hook this up for you.

09:26.571 --> 09:29.165
I think my car hates me.

09:29.774 --> 09:32.470
Oh, but, Nick, this is a nice ride.

09:32.644 --> 09:34.407
- Oh, you like this, huh?
- Yeah.

09:34.579 --> 09:37.241
You know, look.
It even heats the undercarriage.

09:38.149 --> 09:40.276
I like it.

09:41.186 --> 09:43.154
"I like it."

09:43.321 --> 09:46.290
Remember the score:
One player, two kids and...

09:46.858 --> 09:48.450
Holy moly!

09:50.195 --> 09:51.822
Oh, that is so cool.

09:51.996 --> 09:53.964
That's a Satchel Paige bobblehead.

09:54.132 --> 09:56.225
That's when he played for the Monarchs.

09:56.401 --> 10:01.031
What? A woman that knows a little
something about Satchel?

10:01.206 --> 10:04.607
He was my daddy's idol.
He pitched for five decades...

10:04.776 --> 10:08.803
including three shutout innings
for the Royals at the age of 59.

10:08.980 --> 10:12.143
Well, you know, my man Satch
used to have a saying:

10:12.317 --> 10:15.309
"Age is a question of mind over matter.

10:15.486 --> 10:18.319
If you don't mind, it don't matter."

10:18.489 --> 10:21.049
You know that?

10:25.496 --> 10:26.963
This is Suzanne.

10:27.131 --> 10:29.122
Hubba-hubba. Now, that's a woman.

10:29.434 --> 10:34.098
Plenty of smarts, easy on the eyes,
and can quote my stats.

10:34.272 --> 10:37.332
I don't care if she got 100 kids.
I like her.

10:38.810 --> 10:42.007
All we gotta do is lose the small fries.

10:42.247 --> 10:45.182
Now, I'm not saying
drop them in the shark tank. No.

10:45.350 --> 10:48.444
But there's nothing kids like more
than military school.

10:48.853 --> 10:50.980
Out of sight, out of mind.

10:52.290 --> 10:54.087
Excuse me?

10:56.227 --> 10:57.353
I don't mind.

10:57.528 --> 11:01.191
- If you need a lift, I'll give you a ride.
- Oh, okay.

11:01.366 --> 11:05.769
Smooth, Nick. Here's how I think
that we gonna make our move.

11:06.070 --> 11:08.834
Pretend like you gonna help her
with her seat belt...

11:09.007 --> 11:13.501
then with your free hand, put your
arm around her shoulder and... Hey!

11:13.678 --> 11:17.546
Let me out! How am I gonna
wave you home if I can't see the play?

11:17.715 --> 11:20.479
I'm a hall-of-famer.
How about showing some respect?

11:21.786 --> 11:23.276
And that's my story.

11:23.454 --> 11:25.388
What about you, Nick? Are you local?

11:26.791 --> 11:29.316
- Black man from Oregon?
- Right.

11:29.494 --> 11:31.655
No. I'm from St. Louis.

11:31.829 --> 11:35.890
I actually moved out here to play
Triple-A ball with the Beavers...

11:36.067 --> 11:39.503
but ended up hurting my shoulder,
and it kind of ended my career.

11:39.671 --> 11:41.536
Oh, you threw your arm out pitching.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.572
Well, not exactly.

11:44.742 --> 11:48.200
I tore my rotator cuff lifting my
big-screen TV out of a U-Haul.

11:51.783 --> 11:53.842
- That's really sad.
- I know.

11:54.018 --> 11:58.717
Good thing there's athlete's insurance,
in case you do something stupid.

12:01.492 --> 12:04.620
So, you know, I was wondering...

12:04.796 --> 12:08.493
if maybe you'd consider...
If you wasn't busy...

12:09.400 --> 12:12.369
- What is going on out here?
- Mom, where have you been?

12:12.537 --> 12:16.667
Miss Mable burned our dinner,
fell asleep and just keeps farting.

12:19.243 --> 12:21.404
Kevin and Lindsey, this is Mr. Persons.

12:21.579 --> 12:23.672
He was nice enough to give me a ride home.

12:23.848 --> 12:25.941
What's he want, a reward?

12:27.952 --> 12:29.249
You know what?

12:29.420 --> 12:31.684
I really better get out of here.

12:32.056 --> 12:34.024
Smart.

12:36.027 --> 12:39.690
Hey, Nick? I don't mean to be a pest...

12:39.864 --> 12:44.198
but I was just wondering if you could
give me a ride to work tomorrow.

12:44.369 --> 12:47.463
- Of course.
- Oh, great. Thank you.

12:47.772 --> 12:50.400
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

12:52.377 --> 12:54.072
Mom, do you know what time it is?

12:54.245 --> 12:56.713
Excuse me, I'm the mother.
Get in the house.

12:56.881 --> 12:58.542
- Get in the house.
- It's raining.

12:58.716 --> 13:01.184
- Get in the house.
- Who is this stud, Nick?

13:01.352 --> 13:03.320
You're supposed to be in bed.

14:07.051 --> 14:10.179
Nick, thank you so much for
helping me these past couple days.

14:10.354 --> 14:14.723
- You are so sweet.
- Yeah, I know.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.688
Hey, does this seem ripe to you?

14:19.163 --> 14:23.657
I don't know. I don't eat food unless
it has an expiration date on it.

14:23.835 --> 14:28.363
Nick, you are funny. You eat worse
than my 7-year-old son.

14:28.739 --> 14:30.969
You kind of dress like him too.

14:31.142 --> 14:32.575
What's wrong with that?

14:32.877 --> 14:35.744
And do you know I have never
seen you without a hat?

14:36.047 --> 14:38.709
- You don't need to see me without it.
- Let me see.

14:38.883 --> 14:40.316
- What's under there?
- What?

14:40.485 --> 14:42.885
- Come on, Nick.
- Watch out. Get back. Hold on.

14:43.054 --> 14:46.023
- Get back.
- Give me that.

14:51.362 --> 14:54.763
Hang on. Don't move.

14:55.466 --> 14:57.229
There.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.933
- Nick, wait.
- Right.

15:07.111 --> 15:09.773
- Wanna go to my apartment?
- No, I can't. I can't.

15:09.947 --> 15:14.509
I've thought about it. I really have.
But let's be realistic. I'm a single mom.

15:14.685 --> 15:17.745
No, you're a sexy mama.

15:19.156 --> 15:22.250
Do you know this whole time
we've been hanging out...

15:22.426 --> 15:24.758
you've never once asked me about my kids?

15:26.831 --> 15:30.358
- How they doing?
- I bet you don't remember their names.

15:32.436 --> 15:34.996
Rudy and Theo?

15:35.172 --> 15:36.867
Nick.

15:40.545 --> 15:43.412
I think we should just be friends.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.485
Next point wins. Let's go.

15:50.755 --> 15:53.053
Hold on to your earrings there,
Yao Bling...

15:53.224 --> 15:57.490
because I'm gonna embarrass you.
And it's gonna hurt because I love you.

15:57.662 --> 15:59.926
- Give me that.
- Hey, that's a foul.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.429
- Come on, man, you hit my hand.
- No, I didn't.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.898
Right here, baby. Right here.

16:05.069 --> 16:06.263
Game time.

16:07.204 --> 16:09.934
Yeah, baby. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

16:10.308 --> 16:12.868
Get off of me, Lurch.
That was a moving pick.

16:13.044 --> 16:15.069
Let's run it again. Same teams. Come on.

16:15.313 --> 16:16.974
No. I gotta go, y'all.

16:17.148 --> 16:19.275
What? We're tied. Somebody has to lose.

16:19.450 --> 16:22.613
- It's the American way.
- Hey, somebody did lose.

16:22.787 --> 16:25.779
- You know I gotta go do that thing.
- What thing? What?

16:25.957 --> 16:29.415
You know, I gotta take Suzanne
to the airport in the morning.

16:29.961 --> 16:33.829
Take Suzanne to the airport
in the morning.

16:33.998 --> 16:36.660
- You are stuck in the friend zone.
- Get out of here.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.667
Listen to me. We've been friends
a very long time...

16:39.837 --> 16:42.431
and I am telling you,
you gotta dump this girl.

16:42.607 --> 16:45.804
- What? We not even going out.
- That's the point, Nick.

16:45.977 --> 16:49.105
Whatever it is you don't have
going on, it has got to end.

16:50.314 --> 16:53.249
Okay, for all those who listen
to this clown...

16:53.417 --> 16:55.851
Nick Persons will never be
in the friend zone.

16:56.020 --> 16:59.478
- Understand that and believe that.
- Friend zone. Friend zone.

16:59.657 --> 17:02.182
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- Friend zone.

17:10.835 --> 17:13.166
- Here you go.
- Oh, Nick, thank you so much.

17:13.337 --> 17:15.134
You are such a great friend.

17:16.073 --> 17:18.564
<i>The friend zone is for losers only.</i>

17:18.843 --> 17:22.369
<i>Please unload your friend
and get on with your life.</i>

17:22.980 --> 17:25.380
- Well, wish me luck.
- Good luck.

17:27.451 --> 17:29.681
Thanks for everything, Nick.

17:30.888 --> 17:33.948
Suzanne, can I talk to you real quick?

17:34.458 --> 17:35.720
Sure.

17:35.893 --> 17:39.727
You know, what we got going... I mean,
we don't really have something...

17:39.897 --> 17:41.956
I don't really know what to call this...

17:42.133 --> 17:44.067
- Hang on.
- ...but it seems kind of...

17:44.235 --> 17:46.396
This is Suzanne.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.173
Yes, Frank.

17:50.341 --> 17:51.365
Just one sec.

17:54.145 --> 17:56.306
Well, when did that happen?

17:57.014 --> 18:00.006
Well, actually,
I'm already at the airport.

18:00.451 --> 18:03.045
- Hey. You can't park here.
- I know.

18:03.220 --> 18:06.121
My friend's making a call.
She'll be off in a second.

18:06.290 --> 18:08.554
- Gonna be an expensive call.
- I'm right here.

18:08.859 --> 18:10.622
That's why you're getting a ticket.

18:10.795 --> 18:14.060
They're expecting to spend
New Year's Eve with you.

18:14.231 --> 18:17.223
Oh, don't... Don't even go there
with me, Frank.

18:17.401 --> 18:20.564
You haven't spent five minutes
with your kids since Labor Day.

18:21.605 --> 18:26.133
Frank, you know what?
I am so sick of this.

18:27.178 --> 18:31.478
I... Hello? Hello?

18:31.982 --> 18:34.780
Know what?
That lady's got enough problems.

18:38.556 --> 18:40.751
All right, let's move it along.

18:46.664 --> 18:48.529
- I'm not going.
- What's the matter?

18:48.699 --> 18:52.157
My ex is sick, and he's not
gonna pick up the kids.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.974
- What about the babysitter?
- She's leaving for Las Vegas...

18:58.142 --> 19:01.669
- with her church group.
- Oh, no.

19:02.913 --> 19:04.778
You know, my kids miss him so much...

19:04.949 --> 19:08.885
and all he ever does is pull the rug
out right from under them.

19:10.855 --> 19:13.153
I'm gonna lose my job.

19:25.703 --> 19:27.864
What if I bring them?

19:28.038 --> 19:30.563
I couldn't ask you to do that.
That's too much.

19:30.741 --> 19:33.642
Why not? Look, it's no big deal. Serious.

19:36.347 --> 19:38.440
- Really?
- Positive.

19:39.283 --> 19:42.013
- Are you sure?
- I wanna help you on this.

19:43.788 --> 19:46.018
Nick, this is huge.

19:47.358 --> 19:49.019
Thank you so much.

19:49.794 --> 19:52.092
You are a lifesaver.

19:52.263 --> 19:56.324
Okay, so I'll get the three tickets, and
as soon as you guys land, call me.

19:57.301 --> 20:00.634
Oh, no, I meant that I'll drop them off
at the airport.

20:00.805 --> 20:03.899
Oh, no. You can't expect the kids
to travel alone, Nick.

20:04.074 --> 20:07.566
Kevin's got asthma. That recycled air
in the plane... I mean, yuck.

20:07.745 --> 20:09.838
But it'd be fine. Kids fly all the time.

20:10.014 --> 20:12.505
It's nothing.
I'll make sure they get on the plane.

20:12.683 --> 20:16.642
They'll get milk and cookies, little
plastic wings, get to meet the pilot.

20:16.821 --> 20:19.654
You know, it'd be real cool.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.993
Especially with me sitting next to them
making sure everything is all right.

20:25.629 --> 20:29.224
Oh, how could I ever repay you?

20:42.346 --> 20:44.678
Obviously, you don't care
that she's using you.

20:44.849 --> 20:46.407
But ask yourself this:

20:46.584 --> 20:49.382
Would you trust a woman
who'd trust you with her kids?

20:49.553 --> 20:51.953
I'm tempted to call Child Services
right now.

20:52.356 --> 20:54.688
Uncle Nick loves kids.

20:55.192 --> 20:59.060
Big lummox.
Might as well just put myself on eBay.

21:00.764 --> 21:04.359
Hello. I'm here to pick up the kids.

21:06.203 --> 21:08.603
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

21:08.772 --> 21:11.935
What you wasting your time
with Miss Suzanne for?

21:12.376 --> 21:14.571
- Excuse me?
- You come with me.

21:15.379 --> 21:18.974
Miss Mable will take you
on a guided tour to Sin City.

21:19.884 --> 21:22.216
Oh, God. Excuse me.

21:23.287 --> 21:26.552
Hello? Somebody?

21:27.391 --> 21:29.382
Who wants to go to Vancouver?

21:45.676 --> 21:48.474
Mom says that we should be polite.

21:48.913 --> 21:52.781
Now, kids, I know you're disappointed
about your father...

21:53.150 --> 21:56.381
but you're going to have fun.

21:57.254 --> 21:58.687
Aren't you?

21:58.856 --> 22:01.120
- Yes, Miss Mable.
- Yes, Miss Mable.

22:03.894 --> 22:06.089
Hey, did you bring us a gift?

22:06.263 --> 22:09.926
Yeah, Mom's man friends
always bring us presents.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.625
Oh, of course.

22:12.803 --> 22:17.035
What kind of guy you think I am?
Uncle Nick loves kids.

22:17.574 --> 22:21.374
As a matter of fact... Look, look, look.

22:21.545 --> 22:23.843
Dr. Munchies pizza coupon.

22:24.014 --> 22:27.780
You get a free liter of soda with any
purchase of a large pepperoni.

22:27.952 --> 22:31.251
- What's a liter?
- Oh, yeah, and for you...

22:34.458 --> 22:37.859
- Look at that. Corkscrew.
- Cool.

22:38.162 --> 22:41.325
- Hey, it's got a knife.
- You can't give him that.

22:41.632 --> 22:43.327
- Shut up.
- Make me.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.491
I don't make trash. I bury it.

22:45.669 --> 22:49.969
- Well, I'll bury my foot in your...
- Say it. You're too scared to say it.

22:50.140 --> 22:51.869
Be quiet, you paranoid dunce.

22:52.042 --> 22:53.407
- Chicken.
- Stop it. Stop it.

22:57.381 --> 22:59.246
Hey, wanna learn some Chinese?

23:00.651 --> 23:02.346
Sure. What you got?

23:05.990 --> 23:09.517
Sensei says,
"The first one is always a decoy."

23:11.061 --> 23:13.120
Shotgun!

23:14.098 --> 23:18.296
That's my seat. You stop.

23:23.774 --> 23:27.073
They gonna eat you alive.

23:29.146 --> 23:32.115
- You're too ugly to sit in the front seat.
- That's my seat.

23:32.349 --> 23:34.442
Hey! Watch the paint.

23:42.126 --> 23:44.856
Okay, now, once we get in this terminal...

23:45.029 --> 23:47.020
I want everybody sticking together.

23:47.197 --> 23:48.926
Now, be careful opening that door.

23:51.502 --> 23:53.527
Man! What did...?

23:57.975 --> 24:01.775
- Sorry, Nick.
- Oh, damn!

24:01.945 --> 24:05.039
- Boy, didn't you hear what I just said?
- You swore.

24:05.215 --> 24:08.878
You damn right I swore. That's about
$400 worth of damage to my new car.

24:09.053 --> 24:12.181
That's twice. Now you have to put
$2 in the swear jar.

24:12.356 --> 24:14.881
Yeah, well, he gotta put about $400
in my pocket.

24:15.059 --> 24:16.890
- You got $400 for me?
- No.

24:17.061 --> 24:18.255
And I want it cash.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.935
Okay, man, no tears, all right?

24:26.103 --> 24:27.661
I won't change diapers out here.

24:27.838 --> 24:32.002
Real good. Have you ever thought
of being a youth pastor or a therapist?

24:32.176 --> 24:35.270
Look, it ain't like I said I was gonna
take off my belt.

24:35.446 --> 24:37.676
He's gonna beat me, Lindsey! Save me!

24:37.848 --> 24:39.782
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't touch me!

24:39.950 --> 24:42.248
- Little dude. Kevin. Come here.
- Get away!

24:42.419 --> 24:43.886
Is there a problem here, sir?

24:44.054 --> 24:46.318
Just a little game I'm playing
with the kids.

24:46.490 --> 24:48.754
Boy, bring your butt back here!

24:48.926 --> 24:51.360
Kevin. Boy. Look.

24:51.528 --> 24:53.826
Yo, yo, yo. Hey, hey. Look, look.

24:53.997 --> 24:55.624
Look, I got money. Check it out.

24:55.799 --> 24:57.562
Will that shut you up, huh?

24:57.734 --> 24:59.998
Here you go. Ten bucks. Come on.

25:00.971 --> 25:02.666
Yeah. That's right.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.570
Hey, you can't buy us off. Apologize.

25:05.742 --> 25:07.607
No, no. We're cool.

25:08.011 --> 25:10.241
Yeah. We cool, little mama.

25:10.414 --> 25:14.180
Plus, there's enough to go around.
Got a ten-spot for you too.

25:15.486 --> 25:18.478
I do believe I'm older than him.

25:22.793 --> 25:27.162
I can't believe I'm getting hustled
by a couple of gangsters. Here.

25:27.798 --> 25:30.289
Now, hurry up. We can't be late.

25:32.069 --> 25:34.833
When we go through, they can see
our bones and innards?

25:35.105 --> 25:38.074
- No, fool, that's an x-ray.
- Wrong answer.

25:38.242 --> 25:39.504
It's a metal detector.

25:39.676 --> 25:41.371
Oh, to see if you have any bombs?

25:41.979 --> 25:43.970
You're not allowed to say "bombs" here.

25:44.148 --> 25:47.914
- Why can't you say "bomb"?
- Please remove all metal objects.

25:48.085 --> 25:50.349
Keys, loose change, cell phones, jewelry.

25:50.521 --> 25:52.751
Okay. Just might take a minute.

25:57.294 --> 26:02.561
I hope you left Nick's little present
in the car, or else you're going to jail.

26:18.182 --> 26:20.173
Cell phone.

26:21.985 --> 26:23.316
Car keys.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.049
Excuse me. Sir?

26:39.169 --> 26:40.466
What? What?

26:40.637 --> 26:42.764
Sir, can you step to the red line, please?

26:42.940 --> 26:45.272
I put everything on the tray.

26:46.543 --> 26:49.740
Please raise your arms
and separate your legs.

27:02.826 --> 27:04.054
Corkscrew!

27:11.401 --> 27:14.632
Let's just get out of here before
I end up in Guantánamo Bay.

27:14.805 --> 27:16.830
Our dad would've never given him a knife.

27:17.007 --> 27:19.771
- Yeah, I'm not your dad.
- That's for sure.

27:23.547 --> 27:25.572
All right, let's go. Pick it up.

27:25.749 --> 27:29.014
It's actually gonna work out better
because trains are more fun.

27:29.186 --> 27:31.984
- Do you got any snacks?
- You mean candy?

27:32.155 --> 27:33.952
- No way.
- I have to pee.

27:34.958 --> 27:38.826
Can't you wait till we get on the train?
It's right there.

27:38.996 --> 27:42.693
- I don't think I can wait that long.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

27:42.866 --> 27:45.596
He's prone to bladder infections,
you know.

27:47.871 --> 27:50.305
All right, man, go do your business.

27:52.075 --> 27:53.770
Aren't you coming in with me?

27:55.879 --> 27:58.575
Yeah, but I'm not touching nothing.

28:01.551 --> 28:02.950
All aboard!

28:03.120 --> 28:06.021
- Come on, come on.
- I'm coming.

28:08.158 --> 28:10.319
Wait. My shoe's untied.

28:11.328 --> 28:12.989
Come on.

28:14.364 --> 28:16.093
All clear.

28:19.002 --> 28:20.333
Come on, Kevin. Hurry up.

28:22.506 --> 28:24.406
Over...

28:26.376 --> 28:29.470
Loop. Other loop.

28:31.048 --> 28:34.211
You know what? Let me do it.
Let me do it. Let me do it.

28:36.553 --> 28:38.521
No! Pull from the first loop.

28:38.689 --> 28:42.216
- Otherwise it's too tight at the top.
- Okay, okay.

28:42.426 --> 28:46.021
The boy has problems. He won't eat
anything orange, steamed or poached.

28:46.196 --> 28:48.892
And what he does eat, they can't touch.

28:49.132 --> 28:51.760
- Okay, there you go.
- No. Do it again.

28:51.935 --> 28:53.630
That doesn't feel right.

28:53.804 --> 28:55.635
His socks can't have elastic in them.

28:55.806 --> 28:58.400
And he won't use a toothbrush
more than five days.

28:58.575 --> 29:00.372
- Shut up!
- Make me.

29:00.544 --> 29:02.273
Who'd wanna make another one...?

29:02.446 --> 29:03.845
Come on.

29:04.681 --> 29:07.309
Hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:23.867 --> 29:27.234
Hey. Where's Galaktico's cape?

29:32.442 --> 29:34.103
Kevin.

29:35.779 --> 29:38.247
<i>Final boarding call
for Vancouver passengers...</i>

29:38.415 --> 29:40.883
<i>departing from track two.</i>

29:45.522 --> 29:47.888
Look, it's damp.

29:54.631 --> 29:57.896
Kevin! Lindsey!

30:02.172 --> 30:06.438
Hey! Hey! Kevin! Lindsey!

30:13.183 --> 30:15.413
Hey. The train's moving.

30:19.322 --> 30:20.949
Out my way.

30:21.358 --> 30:23.690
Hey! Crazy kids. Yo!

30:24.361 --> 30:26.989
Hey! Hey, come on!

30:27.197 --> 30:28.721
What are you doing?

30:28.899 --> 30:30.196
Sorry, lady.

30:30.367 --> 30:32.528
- Hey!
- What's he doing?

30:32.702 --> 30:36.502
I think he wants us to jump
onto a moving train.

30:42.813 --> 30:47.182
Hey! Kevin! Lindsey! Hey! Get up here!

30:47.451 --> 30:48.850
Come on!

30:49.019 --> 30:51.613
Hey, what are you doing? Run!

30:51.788 --> 30:53.915
Are you crazy? Jump!

30:54.090 --> 30:56.183
Come on!

31:04.835 --> 31:06.826
Mama.

31:09.206 --> 31:14.234
- Hey, Nick, how's the train ride going?
- Well, we haven't exactly left yet.

31:14.411 --> 31:17.312
We decided to drive.
It should be much more educational.

31:17.481 --> 31:21.008
Oh, no, Nick, I cannot let you do that.
That's way too much trouble.

31:21.184 --> 31:23.311
No, no. It'll only take
a few more hours...

31:23.487 --> 31:26.456
and gives me a chance to get
to know Kevin and Lindsey.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.614
<i>Okay. I'm really impressed.</i>

31:29.059 --> 31:31.527
<i>- You're very sweet.
- Yes, I am.</i>

31:31.862 --> 31:36.299
You sound like you have everything
under control. Can I talk to the kids?

31:36.466 --> 31:37.990
Oh, okay.

31:38.168 --> 31:41.604
Look, don't tell them nothing
that happened, okay?

31:42.806 --> 31:44.831
<i>- He lost our luggage.
- What?</i>

31:45.008 --> 31:46.339
- Are you guys dating?
- No.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.068
- No.
- Let me talk.

31:48.245 --> 31:49.769
We wanna go to Dad's.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.376
You cannot go to Dad's now.
You're going with Nick.

31:53.783 --> 31:56.115
Why? Dad's house is in the same direction.

31:56.586 --> 31:59.521
Nick could drop us off there
on his way not to date you.

31:59.689 --> 32:01.850
<i>Honey, your dad is sick and in bed.</i>

32:02.025 --> 32:03.356
<i>Now, if you want me to...</i>

32:03.527 --> 32:06.724
I can just quit my job, and we'll
go live in a cardboard box.

32:07.631 --> 32:09.758
Whatever.

32:10.634 --> 32:13.068
- Let him drive.
- Be nice.

32:13.236 --> 32:14.931
<i>- I love you.
- Love you too.</i>

32:15.105 --> 32:16.766
Bye.

32:18.808 --> 32:22.471
Now, look, driving you two gremlins
on New Year's Eve...

32:22.646 --> 32:26.878
for over 300 miles was never
on the agenda. Okay?

32:27.050 --> 32:30.542
We just drove across town,
and y'all done messed up my door.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.484
So now I got to lay down some rules.

32:33.757 --> 32:34.781
Rule number...

32:38.295 --> 32:41.025
Rule number one:
Don't touch the climate control.

32:41.565 --> 32:43.590
Rule number two: Don't kick the seat.

32:43.767 --> 32:46.565
Rule number three: Don't play with toys.

32:46.870 --> 32:50.033
- Can I play with my pizza coupon?
- No sassing me.

32:50.206 --> 32:53.437
No eating in the car, no drinking
in the car and no smoking.

32:53.610 --> 32:55.305
- I don't smoke.
- Good.

32:55.478 --> 32:57.002
Don't start on my watch.

32:57.180 --> 32:59.045
I don't want you to touch the radio.

32:59.215 --> 33:02.116
I don't even want you to sniff
the new-car smell.

33:02.285 --> 33:05.083
I want you to sit down
on that protective plastic...

33:05.255 --> 33:07.689
and be seen, not heard.

33:29.879 --> 33:34.111
You know, if you're thinking about
my mom, you're wasting your time.

33:34.818 --> 33:38.686
I'm not wasting my time, because
me and your mom, we're just friends.

33:38.855 --> 33:42.689
That's good, because Mom's still
into Dad, and he's totally into her.

33:42.859 --> 33:44.451
They're getting back together.

33:45.128 --> 33:47.494
Whoopee! I'm happy for them.

33:47.664 --> 33:49.256
Or maybe you guys should go out.

33:49.432 --> 33:52.629
A couple of dates with you would
really make her appreciate Dad.

33:55.405 --> 33:57.305
Let's go.

34:02.145 --> 34:04.579
Have a taste of my steel, zombie.

34:05.115 --> 34:07.879
- Yes!
- That game doesn't sound G-rated.

34:08.118 --> 34:10.085
Yeah, but it's keeping him occupied.

34:10.253 --> 34:14.417
The boy played Lady Pac-Man at the
mall and had nightmares for a week.

34:14.591 --> 34:16.491
- Give it here, Kevin.
- Hey, give it!

34:16.659 --> 34:19.060
- Give it to me. What did I say?
- It's not yours!

34:19.228 --> 34:22.197
- Give it here now!
- You're not the boss of me!

34:22.364 --> 34:23.764
Cut it out.

34:23.933 --> 34:26.697
Why don't we call Mom
and see what she has to say.

34:27.370 --> 34:28.837
Fine.

34:29.005 --> 34:30.734
You win.

34:33.109 --> 34:34.337
Snitch.

34:36.746 --> 34:38.270
Baby.

34:38.447 --> 34:41.178
- Big baby.
- Bigger baby.

34:41.551 --> 34:44.213
- Giant baby.
- Enormous baby.

34:44.387 --> 34:47.014
- Humongous baby.
- Colossal baby.

34:47.190 --> 34:49.181
- Am not. Am not.
- Are too. Are too.

34:49.359 --> 34:50.826
- Am not. Am not.
- Are too.

34:51.027 --> 34:52.391
Okay, okay.

34:52.562 --> 34:55.360
You're both acting
like a couple of babies.

35:12.082 --> 35:13.811
Keep it moving. Come on.

35:15.685 --> 35:18.745
That's right. Drink your juice, baby.

35:19.689 --> 35:23.386
- Hey, no food in the car.
- It's not food. It's juice.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.152
- Same difference. Give it.
- Mine.

35:25.328 --> 35:26.852
Hey!

35:27.030 --> 35:28.463
Man, see?

35:28.631 --> 35:30.861
Oh, y'all think that's funny, don't you?

35:31.034 --> 35:32.729
It's not funny.

35:40.310 --> 35:41.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No.

35:42.045 --> 35:44.570
One thing you gotta know here,
we keep it real.

35:44.748 --> 35:46.477
You can believe that.

35:51.488 --> 35:52.716
Yuck! Noisy.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.119
- What is that?
- 50 Cent.

35:55.291 --> 35:57.782
Well, I'll pay him a dollar
just to shut up.

35:59.763 --> 36:02.197
Do you have any Justin Timberlake
or Clay Aiken?

36:03.666 --> 36:06.362
Lord, these kids
are ethnically challenged.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.461
Do you know you can get shot...

36:08.638 --> 36:10.970
by playing those CDs
in my old neighborhood?

36:11.141 --> 36:14.577
- We're not ghetto.
- Or trying to be ghetto fabulous.

36:14.744 --> 36:16.939
We're just fabulous.

36:35.899 --> 36:38.493
About time. Open road.

36:38.668 --> 36:40.499
Vancouver, here we come.

36:52.482 --> 36:53.676
Yeah.

37:08.464 --> 37:09.692
I have to pee.

37:10.099 --> 37:12.795
What? No, no, you do not have to pee.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.834
Didn't you go at the train station?

37:15.004 --> 37:17.871
I tried to go, but there was a man
standing next to me...

37:18.041 --> 37:19.338
so it just went away.

37:19.509 --> 37:21.875
But look, man, all this open road.

37:22.045 --> 37:24.707
You can hold it. I know you can.
Cross your legs.

37:26.149 --> 37:29.243
- You should've asked before we left.
- I did.

37:29.419 --> 37:33.219
No, you asked before we got on the
train, not before we left the station.

37:33.489 --> 37:35.684
You're supposed to ask
before every segment.

37:35.925 --> 37:38.723
- Everyone knows that.
- Evidently not.

37:39.128 --> 37:41.790
I'm not gonna make it.
Do you have a bottle?

37:42.065 --> 37:44.192
- No.
- How about this ashtray?

37:44.367 --> 37:46.665
Kevin, there's no receptacle
in this vehicle.

37:46.836 --> 37:50.033
Now, look, the exit is about
a mile away, and you can hold it.

37:50.673 --> 37:52.868
How far is a mile?

37:53.042 --> 37:56.273
I don't know, 5000 and some kind of feet.

37:56.446 --> 37:59.938
Look, think of something else.
Football, a math test...

38:00.116 --> 38:02.141
puberty.

38:03.086 --> 38:04.986
- Are we there yet?
- No.

38:05.154 --> 38:07.088
I'm sure the carpet is absorbent.

38:07.257 --> 38:08.747
Oh, here it comes!

38:09.158 --> 38:12.594
For God's sakes, man,
he's gonna make his water in your car!

38:12.762 --> 38:14.093
No, he ain't.

38:17.901 --> 38:22.099
Incoming! Incoming! Incoming!

38:23.273 --> 38:25.241
Hold it, man.

38:25.608 --> 38:29.271
- Hold it. Oh, no. Look, right here.
- Yeah.

38:32.215 --> 38:33.477
Here we go. Here we go.

38:39.155 --> 38:41.988
In here, in here. Hold it, hold it.

38:42.158 --> 38:43.716
- This is taken!
- I'm sorry!

38:43.893 --> 38:46.953
- Oh, it's dribbling out.
- Okay, go, go. Just go.

38:53.202 --> 38:55.295
- That's disgusting!
- Hey, wait a minute.

38:55.471 --> 38:57.132
Wait a minute, lady. Hold up.

39:16.159 --> 39:17.990
Bought us some groceries for later.

39:18.161 --> 39:19.822
Your mama said you liked fruit.

39:21.464 --> 39:23.796
- Garlic olives?
- Hey, it's a truck stop.

39:23.967 --> 39:25.366
That's all they had.

39:29.639 --> 39:31.038
You see this?

39:32.108 --> 39:34.508
Because of you guys,
I gotta do this right here.

39:34.677 --> 39:37.544
You squeezed it, not me.

39:37.847 --> 39:39.405
It's not coming out.

39:42.952 --> 39:44.943
Hit that green button for me, please.

39:47.824 --> 39:51.191
- Yo, yo, yo.
- Hey. Hey, it's Marty. What's up, man?

39:51.361 --> 39:54.228
How's it going with those
stupid brats you got with you?

39:54.397 --> 39:58.766
<i>Remember this: If the kids hate you,
the mama won't date you.</i>

39:58.935 --> 40:01.130
- Man!
- Where'd you go?

40:01.304 --> 40:02.771
What, are you in a tunnel?

40:02.939 --> 40:04.531
Are you...? Hello?

40:12.348 --> 40:13.610
Okay. All right.

40:15.952 --> 40:17.749
Seat belts.

40:18.855 --> 40:21.255
Nobody gotta go to the bathroom, right?

40:24.494 --> 40:26.052
Okay, here we go.

40:30.833 --> 40:33.063
Nick, we already know about you and Mom.

40:34.837 --> 40:36.566
- You do?
- Of course.

40:36.739 --> 40:39.799
- She talks about you all the time.
- Yeah, Mom's into you.

40:39.976 --> 40:42.536
She says you're better looking
than Taye Diggs.

40:42.712 --> 40:44.043
Oh, yeah?

40:44.213 --> 40:46.477
- I am, huh?
- Oh, sure.

40:46.649 --> 40:49.049
In fact, she told me...

40:50.053 --> 40:52.886
My gosh. Get his inhaler.
He's having an asthma attack.

40:53.056 --> 40:55.581
- What? Where is it?
- It's in the back. Hurry up!

40:55.858 --> 40:57.382
- Go! Go!
- All right, I'm going.

40:57.560 --> 40:59.084
- I got it. I got it.
- Move it!

41:01.364 --> 41:03.025
Good one, Lindsey.

41:03.733 --> 41:05.200
Very funny.

41:05.368 --> 41:07.165
- Open up.
- I knew you were lying.

41:07.336 --> 41:10.703
"We're just friends." You're just
using us to suck up to our mama.

41:10.873 --> 41:12.101
- What?
- Yeah.

41:12.275 --> 41:16.439
You're just a dirty, horny sex man
like all the others. Nasty man.

41:16.612 --> 41:18.671
- You're a nasty, bad man.
- Look...

41:18.848 --> 41:21.180
I tried to do your mama
a favor, you booger.

41:21.350 --> 41:23.978
You probably wanna kiss her, don't you?

41:24.153 --> 41:26.917
Look, look. Off the glass. Off the glass.

41:27.723 --> 41:29.987
And you, open this door.

41:30.159 --> 41:31.751
You forgot the magic word.

41:32.528 --> 41:35.827
- Open this damn door.
- You just swore again.

41:35.998 --> 41:39.058
- Lindsey, he just swore again.
- So what?

41:39.235 --> 41:42.432
- Hey, I'm not playing with you.
- You can't make us do anything.

41:42.872 --> 41:44.703
Hey, this is my car!

41:44.874 --> 41:47.172
You hear me, little girl? This is my car!

41:49.378 --> 41:52.142
You better not. Look at me. I'm serious.

41:52.748 --> 41:55.842
I'm not playing with you,
little girl, okay?

41:56.185 --> 41:58.585
If you don't open up
before I count to three...

41:58.754 --> 42:00.016
somebody gonna get it.

42:02.125 --> 42:03.558
One.

42:06.095 --> 42:07.460
Two.

42:08.731 --> 42:09.993
Three.

42:10.566 --> 42:13.967
No! No! Hey, you stop that car!

42:17.440 --> 42:19.169
Where did he go?

42:21.444 --> 42:23.344
- Now you gonna get it!
- Go! Floor it!

42:23.813 --> 42:25.644
Get out of there! Whoa! Hey!

42:26.115 --> 42:28.276
Stop! Wait a minute!

42:28.451 --> 42:31.147
I don't have any insurance on you, girl!

42:31.320 --> 42:32.651
Hey!

42:33.289 --> 42:36.747
Watch what you're doing!
Watch the spinners!

42:37.093 --> 42:39.118
You're messing up my spinners!

42:39.295 --> 42:41.889
- You know how much they cost?
- You can't catch us.

42:42.565 --> 42:44.032
No!

42:49.572 --> 42:51.631
You little... Give me them keys!

42:51.807 --> 42:54.207
- Dirty sex man.
- What y'all think you're doing?

42:54.377 --> 42:57.369
Let go of my hat! Give me them keys!

43:00.183 --> 43:02.344
Hey, Lindsey, stop this crazy thing!

43:02.518 --> 43:05.351
That man's setting a bad example
for them kids.

43:05.521 --> 43:06.783
- Wait a minute!
- Go! Go!

43:18.301 --> 43:20.428
Now that's frontier justice.

43:51.434 --> 43:53.425
- Hey, turn up the rear heat.
- Yeah.

43:53.603 --> 43:55.127
No. No heat.

43:55.304 --> 43:57.829
No talking.
You're lucky I'm letting you live.

43:58.007 --> 43:59.998
- But...
- But my butt.

44:00.176 --> 44:02.736
I should pull off
on the side of the road...

44:02.912 --> 44:05.073
dig a hole, and bury both you two.

44:05.581 --> 44:07.481
That's what I should do. Yeah.

44:07.650 --> 44:10.744
A hundred years from now,
a grizzly will find your bones...

44:10.920 --> 44:13.514
and pick his teeth with them.
Wouldn't like that.

44:13.823 --> 44:16.485
Can't believe you two. Are you crazy?

44:16.993 --> 44:19.518
- We have rights.
- No, no, you have no rights.

44:22.098 --> 44:26.091
This is my ship, buddy.
I'm the CEO of this SUV.

44:26.269 --> 44:27.827
Believe that.

44:28.638 --> 44:32.699
Breaker, breaker, 26, this is Big Al
out on Highway 5, mile marker 16.

44:32.875 --> 44:36.242
I got two little lambs here been
snatched up by the big, bad wolf.

44:36.412 --> 44:38.778
I need some backup, pronto.

44:40.349 --> 44:42.442
<i>Ten-four, Big Al. Let's squash this bug.</i>

44:43.486 --> 44:48.048
You had no consideration
for my life, your life or my spinners.

44:52.495 --> 44:54.019
What? What do you want?

44:54.196 --> 44:56.130
I'm driving here!

45:08.778 --> 45:11.747
Mister In-a-Hurry. Idiot.

45:17.219 --> 45:18.846
Why is he slowing down?

45:28.564 --> 45:30.191
I don't like this.

45:30.566 --> 45:33.501
Pull over right now.
Pull it over. Pull it over.

45:33.669 --> 45:36.331
- You better do what he says.
- Like hell I will.

45:36.505 --> 45:38.700
I've seen those vigilante trucker movies.

45:40.543 --> 45:42.374
I said, pull over!

45:44.180 --> 45:45.670
What you doing?

45:46.215 --> 45:47.546
Oh, no!

45:53.689 --> 45:55.384
My paint!

45:57.860 --> 45:59.384
You think you got me boxed in?

45:59.729 --> 46:03.187
Well, you can kiss my 330
cubic inches of V8 power, sucker!

46:04.233 --> 46:05.723
Hold on.

46:25.054 --> 46:26.453
Help!

46:29.291 --> 46:32.055
Your insurance premiums
are going through the roof.

47:20.276 --> 47:23.143
No! No! No!

47:24.914 --> 47:26.779
What was Mom thinking?

47:26.949 --> 47:30.146
I don't know. I like him.
He's kind of funny.

47:30.319 --> 47:31.911
Hey, don't get soft.

47:32.087 --> 47:35.545
This man is not our daddy. He's the enemy.

47:37.827 --> 47:40.295
Take me now! Take me now!

47:40.729 --> 47:43.994
This is why we don't come to the city.

48:06.405 --> 48:08.165
Look. Look, man, all I need...

48:08.323 --> 48:12.669
is four rims and four tires,
and I'm gone, I'm out of here.

48:12.828 --> 48:14.129
Can you help me?

48:14.288 --> 48:19.510
No, I cannot do it. I told you already,
the SUV is too big. You no listen.

48:19.610 --> 48:23.388
- So look, use smaller ones.
- Smaller?

48:23.547 --> 48:25.757
Okay. I put on a smaller tire for you.

48:25.958 --> 48:27.885
- Good.
- Now, you come back Tuesday.

48:28.085 --> 48:29.948
- What?
- Today is New Year's Eve.

48:30.087 --> 48:32.973
Time for me to go home.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

48:33.632 --> 48:36.977
See, there's Dad's right there.
It's about 30 miles away.

48:37.177 --> 48:39.855
I'm not walking 30 miles.

48:40.681 --> 48:43.358
Who said anything about walking?

48:44.560 --> 48:47.654
But I have to go home.
It's New Year's Eve. Dick Clark.

48:47.855 --> 48:51.033
- Let me just pay you extra.
- No, no, no and no.

48:51.233 --> 48:53.535
I can make it worth your while.

48:53.635 --> 48:58.040
See what I got? Yao Ming. Rookie card.

48:58.240 --> 49:01.135
Oh, I see. So you think
that just because I am Chinese...

49:01.293 --> 49:03.670
you can get me to do anything.

49:04.705 --> 49:06.340
Hologram.

49:08.584 --> 49:10.802
My Navigator.

49:15.841 --> 49:17.351
No!

49:20.012 --> 49:21.522
Kevin!

49:21.930 --> 49:25.609
Lindsey! Stop playing,
because I'm not in the mood!

49:32.357 --> 49:34.318
Hey! Hey!

49:34.735 --> 49:36.620
Dad's, here we come.

49:38.280 --> 49:42.167
Damn! Hey! Hey!

49:42.326 --> 49:45.609
Hey! What are you doing?

49:45.738 --> 49:47.915
Jump! Jump!

49:48.115 --> 49:49.666
You think he can catch us?

49:49.867 --> 49:51.293
Hey!

49:51.710 --> 49:54.555
- Maybe 10 years ago.
- Hey!

49:54.755 --> 49:57.516
Don't be scared. Just jump.

49:57.716 --> 49:59.351
No!

50:03.931 --> 50:06.692
What's wrong with you kids?

50:23.492 --> 50:24.481
Come on.

50:24.860 --> 50:27.522
Come on. Get! Go!

50:30.432 --> 50:32.662
Come on, fleabag.

50:35.671 --> 50:37.138
No way!

50:37.306 --> 50:40.798
What? Now, get your narrow
butts on this horse now!

50:47.316 --> 50:50.808
- Hey, how you doing, baby?
- Hi. Is everything okay?

50:51.253 --> 50:53.915
Oh, yeah, everything is cool.

50:54.089 --> 50:55.579
Can I call you right back?

50:55.758 --> 50:58.158
Wait, what's that sound?
You sound very jiggly.

50:59.561 --> 51:02.086
Must be your phone.
Everything's cool on this end.

51:02.264 --> 51:05.256
- Are you gonna be here soon?
- Sort of. Kind of.

51:06.535 --> 51:08.264
Let me call you back in 10 minutes.

51:08.437 --> 51:10.598
Wait, wait, I wanna say hi to the kids.

51:11.073 --> 51:12.540
Oh, okay.

51:13.075 --> 51:16.442
She wanna talk to you guys
and make sure everything is all right.

51:18.814 --> 51:20.714
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey.

51:20.883 --> 51:22.578
<i>Hi, babies. How are you doing?</i>

51:22.751 --> 51:25.185
<i>- Are you having fun with Nick?
- Come on.</i>

51:25.654 --> 51:27.588
Hit the turbo!

51:27.823 --> 51:30.451
Let's go! Let's go!

51:34.229 --> 51:37.562
I know, baby, but just try
to make the best of it, okay?

51:37.733 --> 51:41.430
<i>- I love you.
- Love you too. Bye.</i>

51:45.774 --> 51:48.937
- Scoot over, I'm coming aboard.
- That's a bad idea.

51:49.111 --> 51:50.738
- Says who?
- Says the guy...

51:50.913 --> 51:52.505
who put all that junk there.

51:53.549 --> 51:55.039
Oh, snap!

52:09.798 --> 52:11.663
I hate horses.

52:16.138 --> 52:19.596
What take so long?
I have to hang mirror ball.

52:32.054 --> 52:34.716
You little snotty-nosed runts.

52:34.890 --> 52:36.551
I know exactly where you are.

52:36.725 --> 52:38.750
You messing with Nick the Quick, baby.

52:38.927 --> 52:42.021
Now's your chance. Hit yourself
over the head with a brick...

52:42.197 --> 52:44.495
and say that they were kidnapped.

52:44.666 --> 52:46.133
Shut up.

52:50.839 --> 52:52.898
Happy New Year.

53:03.051 --> 53:04.882
You think Nick's okay?

53:05.053 --> 53:07.021
What are you worried about him for?

53:07.189 --> 53:09.885
I'm not. It's just...

53:10.058 --> 53:11.787
maybe we were a little rough.

53:11.960 --> 53:13.188
Oh, please.

53:13.362 --> 53:16.525
That player got what he deserved.

53:16.698 --> 53:18.757
"Get your butts on this horse."

53:18.934 --> 53:21.494
"You got $400?"

53:25.040 --> 53:28.009
I've been thinking. We should've
brought soup or something.

53:28.177 --> 53:29.405
What for?

53:29.578 --> 53:32.411
Because Dad's sick. What is he gonna eat?

53:32.581 --> 53:34.481
He's a dad. I'm sure he has soup.

53:35.050 --> 53:37.951
He must be lonely, living all by himself.

53:38.120 --> 53:39.712
Look, don't bug him about that.

53:39.888 --> 53:43.153
If we want him to hook up with Mom,
we have to be subtle. Got it?

53:43.325 --> 53:44.883
I got it.

54:21.163 --> 54:23.791
Come on, y'all. Let's get out of here.

54:57.699 --> 55:00.497
Want some chocolate cake?
It's world-famous.

55:00.669 --> 55:02.933
Mom says I shouldn't have sugar.

55:05.474 --> 55:08.307
What about you?
It’ll make your mouth all chocolatey.

55:09.211 --> 55:10.439
No, thanks.

55:41.810 --> 55:44.301
Hey. You forgot something.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.452
Sorry about what happened today.

55:55.324 --> 55:57.918
I really wish you guys
didn't have to see that.

55:59.695 --> 56:01.822
He used to look at me like that.

56:03.031 --> 56:04.692
I know, man.

56:06.735 --> 56:09.863
And when he hugged you,
you thought he'd never let you go.

56:10.906 --> 56:14.307
They make you laugh,
they tell you they love you...

56:14.476 --> 56:16.444
then one day, they never come back.

56:17.679 --> 56:20.443
I bet you know all about leaving,
don't you, player?

56:22.818 --> 56:25.480
Know what? As a matter of fact, I do.

56:26.922 --> 56:30.323
But only because the same thing
happened to me when I was your age.

56:31.259 --> 56:33.250
Yeah, my pops walked out on us too.

56:35.964 --> 56:38.626
It's a shame that anybody
can call theyself a father.

56:39.067 --> 56:40.364
But listen...

56:40.535 --> 56:42.935
he's the failure in this, not you.

56:43.638 --> 56:45.833
He's the one that's gonna miss out.

56:46.942 --> 56:50.935
I just hope it don't take you guys as
long as it took me to figure that out...

56:51.313 --> 56:54.544
because it's true.
You guys are some cool kids.

56:58.754 --> 57:01.587
There you go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

57:18.206 --> 57:20.606
- Nick?
- What's up, little man?

57:21.243 --> 57:24.679
If my dad left and your dad left...

57:25.113 --> 57:27.673
does that mean I'll end up like you?

57:28.550 --> 57:31.417
I ain't doing too bad.
Look, I have blingage.

57:31.787 --> 57:33.414
That's not exactly what I meant.

57:33.855 --> 57:37.484
<i>I was watching Oprah, and it was
all about how depressed and lonely...</i>

57:37.659 --> 57:40.787
- bachelors like you are.
- But I'm not depressed or lonely.

57:40.962 --> 57:42.589
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

57:42.764 --> 57:44.425
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

57:44.599 --> 57:47.830
Mom says that if a man is
not married by the time he's 35...

57:48.103 --> 57:50.833
- he's either damaged or gay.
- What?

57:51.640 --> 57:53.631
Well, that would explain those earrings.

57:54.409 --> 57:55.603
Watch it, sucker.

57:55.777 --> 57:58.302
But you do have intimacy issues,
don't you?

57:58.480 --> 58:00.004
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

58:00.182 --> 58:01.513
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

58:01.683 --> 58:03.913
Look, it's obvious you need a timeout...

58:04.086 --> 58:05.917
and you need a little tickle time.

58:06.088 --> 58:10.787
Because all you do is ask
a thousand questions, huh?

58:11.460 --> 58:13.325
Hey. Are you all right?

58:17.265 --> 58:18.789
Kevin.

58:23.171 --> 58:25.435
I'm good.

58:25.607 --> 58:28.804
- You sure?
- Yeah, except...

58:28.977 --> 58:31.639
- I'm out.
- Okay, don't worry about that.

58:31.813 --> 58:33.713
We'll get you more once we get there.

58:34.015 --> 58:35.710
Oh, sure, we can wait...

58:35.884 --> 58:37.784
if you want me to die!

58:44.726 --> 58:48.162
They're closing! Do something, Nick.

58:48.330 --> 58:51.231
No, no, wait. Hold on!
Wait a minute. We need a refill.

58:51.399 --> 58:53.765
Sorry, we're closed. Come back Tuesday.

58:53.935 --> 58:55.903
But I got a sick kid here.

58:58.707 --> 59:01.676
Look, I couldn't help you
even if I wanted to.

59:01.843 --> 59:03.868
The pharmacist has left for the holiday.

59:04.045 --> 59:06.479
- Well, where is he?
- He's off duty.

59:06.748 --> 59:10.548
And I doubt very much he's gonna
want some guy interrupting his holi...

59:13.922 --> 59:16.447
Just a second, sir,
and I'll draw you up a map.

59:22.264 --> 59:24.824
Hey, Nick, that guy was such a meanie.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.025
How'd you get him to do what you wanted?

59:27.202 --> 59:29.966
Oh, that was simple.
I just gave him the look.

59:30.138 --> 59:31.537
It works every time.

59:31.706 --> 59:35.073
- It even worked through glass?
- Oh, yeah.

59:35.243 --> 59:37.871
The look is something
I developed when I was a kid.

59:38.046 --> 59:39.741
I had somewhat of a reputation.

59:39.915 --> 59:42.008
Surprise, surprise.

59:42.184 --> 59:45.676
I don't want everybody stepping
to me, so I give them the look...

59:45.854 --> 59:47.549
which told them, "Back off.

59:47.722 --> 59:50.486
That's a bad mother..." "Shut your mouth."

59:50.659 --> 59:52.718
I wish I could do that.

59:52.894 --> 59:55.021
You got somebody bothering you at school?

59:55.197 --> 59:58.189
An asthmatic in the accelerated
program? What do you think?

01:00:01.836 --> 01:00:04.634
Try this. It's foolproof.

01:00:07.075 --> 01:00:09.635
No, no, check the lip, check the lip.

01:00:13.715 --> 01:00:15.649
Man, do not take my lunch money.

01:00:17.285 --> 01:00:19.753
Here we go, killer. Come on.

01:00:32.367 --> 01:00:34.460
Hey, hey, where y'all going?

01:00:37.606 --> 01:00:40.131
Excuse me, I'm looking for the pharmacist.

01:00:40.442 --> 01:00:41.773
Delwyn? Sure.

01:00:41.943 --> 01:00:43.968
He's...

01:00:44.145 --> 01:00:46.409
- He's right over there.
- That's enough.

01:00:46.581 --> 01:00:48.014
- I got it.
- Give me that.

01:00:48.583 --> 01:00:50.949
Stop clowning around now.

01:00:51.119 --> 01:00:52.711
- Yo.
- Give me my shoe.

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:55.151
Yo. Excuse me, are you the pharmacist?

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.551
Not at the moment. Why?

01:00:57.859 --> 01:01:01.192
Well, look, I got a kid with me, man.
He's got asthma real bad.

01:01:02.864 --> 01:01:05.230
Try some steam. That usually helps.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.493
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

01:01:07.669 --> 01:01:09.762
- Steam?
- That's enough of that.

01:01:09.938 --> 01:01:14.568
Look, look, all I need is a refill, okay?
And I know you can help.

01:01:14.743 --> 01:01:17.075
I'm asking you nice.

01:01:18.446 --> 01:01:22.507
Mister, I've been married
for 38 years. You can't scare me.

01:01:22.684 --> 01:01:26.347
Come on, man, you the pharmacist.
I know you took a oath or something.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:28.584
Not that I can remember, no.

01:01:28.757 --> 01:01:31.157
Hey, will you go over there
and behave yourself?

01:01:31.326 --> 01:01:33.419
Yeah, go get him over there.

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:36.724
You know, folks around here
like to barter.

01:01:37.198 --> 01:01:39.325
You get what you want, I get what I want.

01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:43.130
One hand washes the other.
I scratch your back...

01:01:43.305 --> 01:01:45.068
Get to the point.

01:01:47.742 --> 01:01:49.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't clown me.

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:51.844
Watch the kids.

01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:54.444
All of them?

01:01:59.254 --> 01:02:00.812
You little...

01:02:03.992 --> 01:02:05.482
Oh, my word.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.094
Pie and cake and brownies and pie.

01:02:08.263 --> 01:02:09.662
You said "pie" twice.

01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:11.355
I like pie.

01:02:12.033 --> 01:02:14.024
Kevin, you know Mom would be upset...

01:02:14.202 --> 01:02:17.638
if we were even thinking
about trying any of these...

01:02:17.872 --> 01:02:19.897
chocolatey...

01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:21.736
creamy...

01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:24.139
delicious...

01:02:26.147 --> 01:02:28.411
Hey, I was gonna eat those brownies.

01:02:28.583 --> 01:02:30.574
What? Just take those.

01:02:30.752 --> 01:02:32.413
No, I want yours.

01:02:46.067 --> 01:02:47.398
Take it easy, man.

01:02:50.338 --> 01:02:51.737
Sorry.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.491
Ridiculous.

01:03:13.661 --> 01:03:15.959
What? I got this.

01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:23.965
All right, timeout. Get off of him.

01:03:24.139 --> 01:03:26.334
Get off of him. Get out of here.

01:03:26.508 --> 01:03:29.068
Get off of him, you little gangsters.
Watch out.

01:03:29.477 --> 01:03:32.037
You too! Off of him!

01:03:32.213 --> 01:03:34.443
What is wrong with you kids?

01:03:34.616 --> 01:03:37.278
Why y'all ganging up on him?

01:03:37.719 --> 01:03:38.947
You think you so tough?

01:03:40.822 --> 01:03:43.347
I'd like to see you try that
with somebody my size.

01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:48.452
Okay! Okay, man!

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:51.064
All right, get off me, you little maggots!

01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:55.098
- Do you think we should help him?
- I'm getting mad now. Hey!

01:03:55.904 --> 01:03:57.565
- After this bite.
- Hey, that's it.

01:03:57.739 --> 01:03:59.866
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:02.636
Hey, wait a minute!

01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:04.608
Okay! Get off!

01:04:04.779 --> 01:04:07.646
My shoe! Come back here with my shoe.

01:04:15.824 --> 01:04:18.349
All right, people,
it's time for some karaoke.

01:04:19.961 --> 01:04:21.326
What is she doing?

01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:35.307
She can sing?

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:50.422
She can sing.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.455
Kevin, enough. Kevin, please.

01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:35.387
I didn't know you could sing that good.
Why you didn't say nothing?

01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:37.929
Because before, you were the enemy.

01:06:38.499 --> 01:06:42.868
You know who can sing? Galaktico can sing.

01:06:44.405 --> 01:06:45.929
Hey.

01:06:46.107 --> 01:06:48.337
Okay. All right, okay, okay.

01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:51.307
Put that down, settle down
and put on your seat belt.

01:06:51.546 --> 01:06:53.844
I know why your mama
won't let you have sugar.

01:06:54.148 --> 01:06:56.946
Hyper down. You're like some kind
of crazy dog.

01:06:57.418 --> 01:07:00.979
I know you are, but what am I, Rover?

01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:08.557
Nick, I don't feel so good.

01:07:09.097 --> 01:07:11.429
Do you got anything to drink?

01:07:14.969 --> 01:07:16.561
There you go.

01:07:18.806 --> 01:07:23.140
I'm sorry, Nick, I accidentally
spilled a drop on the floor.

01:07:23.311 --> 01:07:25.609
Little man, don't even worry about it.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.214
There's nothing more
that you can do to this car.

01:07:31.586 --> 01:07:32.848
Oh, no!

01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:36.156
I can't see. I can't see!

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:46.725
Is everybody all right?

01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:49.802
I feel much better now.

01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:57.169
Nick, where are my kids? You were
supposed to be here two hours ago.

01:07:57.345 --> 01:07:59.370
We had a slight delay at the border.

01:07:59.547 --> 01:08:01.276
We're gonna need more paper towels.

01:08:01.449 --> 01:08:03.041
<i>Paper towels? What's going on?</i>

01:08:03.384 --> 01:08:06.376
Nothing. We just pulled over
to clean out the Navigator.

01:08:06.554 --> 01:08:07.816
Are you kidding me?

01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:11.755
It's freezing outside, and you've got
my kids cleaning your precious car?

01:08:11.926 --> 01:08:13.917
Suzanne, it's not like it seems, okay?

01:08:14.095 --> 01:08:15.926
<i>Well, it sounds pretty bad from here.</i>

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:20.796
<i>Nick, if you're not here by 8:00,
you're gonna be in big trouble.</i>

01:08:21.135 --> 01:08:24.536
<i>- Suzanne, I got this.
- Eight o'clock, Nick.</i>

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:29.608
All right, guys, we gotta hustle.
Your mom's getting worried.

01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:33.269
- But it stinks in here.
- Hold your breath.

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.143
What?

01:08:35.316 --> 01:08:36.874
If we don't move...

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.643
maybe it won't kill us.

01:08:41.389 --> 01:08:43.618
Oh, man, you're scared of that deer?

01:08:44.125 --> 01:08:46.389
He ain't gonna hurt you.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:49.997
They come out of the woods when
they get cold. He's probably hungry.

01:08:50.163 --> 01:08:51.631
Try this.

01:08:56.136 --> 01:09:01.006
- Hey. Look what I got.
- Nick, deers are herbivores.

01:09:01.175 --> 01:09:03.837
So what? Everybody loves chocolate chip.

01:09:05.179 --> 01:09:07.807
Hey, buddy, come on.

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:10.344
Cookie.

01:09:12.687 --> 01:09:14.587
Okay, okay, hey, hey, come on.

01:09:15.223 --> 01:09:17.350
- No.
- What? He's not gonna hurt you.

01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:21.523
Look, I'm right here with you.
Come on, come on. Come on.

01:09:21.696 --> 01:09:23.527
Slow. Come on.

01:09:23.698 --> 01:09:26.258
Slowly. Don't scare it. Get in there.

01:09:26.434 --> 01:09:29.426
- What if he's rabid?
- Come on, come on. There we go.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:31.629
There you go. There you go.

01:09:32.173 --> 01:09:35.142
See, he's gentle. He's not gonna hurt you.

01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:36.970
- Give him another.
- No way.

01:09:37.145 --> 01:09:38.737
- Now, look.
- Where's my camera?

01:09:46.554 --> 01:09:48.419
Hey, hey. Hey.

01:09:50.158 --> 01:09:52.490
Down, boy. Sit.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.560
Hey, Bambi. Sit!

01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:58.826
Come on, now.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.695
Bambi.

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:05.195
Give him the look, Nick!
Give him the look!

01:10:05.373 --> 01:10:07.739
All right, you want a piece of me?

01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:15.377
Say uncle. Are you done?

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.518
Your head gotta go over my fireplace?

01:10:17.685 --> 01:10:20.518
- Show him who's boss, Nick.
- Now, just let it go.

01:10:20.688 --> 01:10:23.156
Let it go.

01:10:23.324 --> 01:10:26.350
Now, get your tail out of here
before I kick some deer butt.

01:10:26.527 --> 01:10:28.256
You better run.

01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:35.869
- I hope you got some nice shots.
- Yep.

01:10:36.304 --> 01:10:38.704
Now help me find my keys.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.501
Come on out of there.

01:10:46.814 --> 01:10:48.372
If your mama ever asks...

01:10:48.549 --> 01:10:51.382
don't let her know
I know how to hot-wire a car.

01:10:51.686 --> 01:10:53.415
But you don't know how to do it.

01:10:53.821 --> 01:10:56.312
Quiet down out there.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.549
Have patience.

01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:05.897
- Turn it off, Nick!
- All right, calm down.

01:11:06.067 --> 01:11:08.968
- Hurry up. It's loud.
- And scary.

01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:11.168
This should do it.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.144
- Nick, the car's on fire. It's burning.
- Oh, no.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:25.314
It's gonna burn. Nick, hurry.

01:11:25.486 --> 01:11:28.978
- Be careful.
- Come on, Nick, do it.

01:11:29.423 --> 01:11:30.822
Put it out! Put it out!

01:11:33.094 --> 01:11:35.824
It's gonna burn, Nick! Hurry!

01:11:35.997 --> 01:11:38.090
This could be toxic.

01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:40.063
Worthless.

01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:42.634
- Galaktico!
- Kevin, step back. I got it.

01:11:44.338 --> 01:11:47.273
Hey, Nick, don't forget me. I'm over here.

01:11:47.441 --> 01:11:49.170
I'm on the dashboard, remember?

01:11:49.343 --> 01:11:52.005
Hey! Don't let me burn!

01:11:52.179 --> 01:11:54.113
I'm a limited edition!

01:11:56.284 --> 01:12:00.015
Oh, man.
I never even got to read the manual.

01:12:10.631 --> 01:12:12.599
Hit the dirt!

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:27.705
Why?

01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:30.176
Oh, no.

01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:34.346
This is about a year's pay.

01:12:35.556 --> 01:12:37.387
What did I do?

01:12:37.558 --> 01:12:40.254
What did I do?
Why is this happening to me?

01:12:44.231 --> 01:12:45.630
It was you two.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.963
If I didn't volunteer to babysit
you two little demons...

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:52.469
this wouldn't have never happened,
and I'd still have my car.

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:58.436
Go ahead and cry. I don't care.

01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:05.510
Okay, all right, stop the waterworks.

01:13:07.688 --> 01:13:10.851
Oh, all right. Oh, come on, come on.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:15.061
Stop crying. Stop crying.

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:17.857
It's not your fault. It's not your fault.

01:13:18.032 --> 01:13:22.128
No, no. I just got a little upset, okay?

01:13:22.303 --> 01:13:24.271
That's why you buy insurance.

01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:27.066
All right, let's sit down. Sit down.
Come on, now.

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:30.870
Right here, right here.
It's only a car, okay?

01:13:31.278 --> 01:13:33.303
We are a lot of trouble.

01:13:33.481 --> 01:13:36.382
That's why our daddy
doesn't wanna be with us.

01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:38.517
Whoa, whoa.

01:13:38.686 --> 01:13:40.483
Look at me.

01:13:40.654 --> 01:13:42.713
Don't say that. That's not true.

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:44.790
But we destroyed your Navigator.

01:13:45.493 --> 01:13:48.951
That? Oh, that's nothing.

01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:53.064
That's just a material object.

01:13:53.634 --> 01:13:54.931
It means nothing.

01:13:55.102 --> 01:13:57.593
I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's
with us either.

01:13:58.205 --> 01:13:59.900
Who would?

01:14:01.909 --> 01:14:03.877
Me.

01:14:04.512 --> 01:14:06.070
I would.

01:14:07.615 --> 01:14:09.708
But you know what?

01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:12.375
Maybe your mother's right, you know.

01:14:12.553 --> 01:14:14.111
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

01:14:14.422 --> 01:14:16.788
I mean, look at you two. You're a mess.

01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:20.222
I keep losing you,
feeding you the wrong stuff.

01:14:20.995 --> 01:14:24.089
If you were goldfish, you'd be dead.

01:14:25.066 --> 01:14:28.467
You know, you're doing okay.
This is just your first day.

01:14:28.769 --> 01:14:32.102
Yeah, you have to get experience.
You'll get used to it.

01:14:32.273 --> 01:14:34.639
Yeah, and there's books you can read too.

01:14:36.877 --> 01:14:38.435
Thanks.

01:14:38.612 --> 01:14:39.909
But you know what?

01:14:40.347 --> 01:14:42.781
If we're not magically in front
of your mother...

01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:44.941
in the next 30 minutes or so...

01:14:45.119 --> 01:14:46.916
she'll never talk to me again.

01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:51.286
Hey, if it's the bottom of the ninth, and
you're down two runs, do you quit?

01:14:51.459 --> 01:14:55.293
No. You put that ball back on the tee,
and you keep swinging.

01:15:00.468 --> 01:15:02.561
Well, let's keep swinging.

01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:05.762
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:08.209 --> 01:15:11.872
Now we gotta figure out how
we gonna get to Vancouver.

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:16.248
Hey, look.

01:15:16.417 --> 01:15:18.612
I found your keys, Nick.

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:21.184
What?

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.687
It's just my luck.

01:15:32.133 --> 01:15:34.260
Let's get out of here.

01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:38.603
- Come on.
- Right here, baby. Come on, now.

01:15:41.775 --> 01:15:43.106
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

01:15:43.878 --> 01:15:45.709
You got one.

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:52.684
Oh, man, thanks.

01:15:52.853 --> 01:15:57.085
We're on our way to Vancouver,
and I really, really appreciate this.

01:15:57.258 --> 01:15:59.749
I couldn't leave these kids
here on the highway.

01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:03.494
That's why I'm leaving you, you animal!

01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:07.032
Wait a minute!
Come back here, you hillbilly!

01:16:07.201 --> 01:16:08.566
Come here!

01:16:09.803 --> 01:16:11.964
No. Let me in. Let...

01:16:14.675 --> 01:16:18.202
Hey, yo, bring me back my kids!

01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:29.679
Stop.

01:16:32.026 --> 01:16:33.254
Mister, are you crazy?

01:16:33.427 --> 01:16:36.191
Some psycho trucker took my kids.
We gotta catch him.

01:16:36.363 --> 01:16:39.662
Well, hop aboard. I'll help you.
Ernst to the rescue.

01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:47.065
Suzanne, they'll be here any minute.
I'm sure they're fine.

01:16:47.241 --> 01:16:50.267
Now, let's concentrate on the party.

01:17:00.921 --> 01:17:02.786
We were completely wrong about Nick.

01:17:03.324 --> 01:17:07.658
Yeah, but now we know
he's kind and gentle.

01:17:07.828 --> 01:17:11.787
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, slim, get me closer.

01:17:11.966 --> 01:17:13.399
- Come on, Nick.
- I got it.

01:17:13.567 --> 01:17:15.000
- Get off.
- Open up, you jerk.

01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:16.796
Nick, save us! Help!

01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:18.404
- Stop this truck!
- Get off!

01:17:18.572 --> 01:17:20.904
- You lunatic!
- Stop this truck!

01:17:22.943 --> 01:17:24.968
Kind and gentle, huh?

01:17:28.315 --> 01:17:30.010
- Go, man.
- I'm moving.

01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:32.084
This thing wasn't built for speed.

01:17:36.023 --> 01:17:38.184
Come on, you're driving like a old lady.

01:17:38.359 --> 01:17:41.157
No, no, you watch.
Ernst knows how to drive.

01:17:47.101 --> 01:17:48.830
That's what I'm talking about.

01:17:49.003 --> 01:17:51.403
- Let us out now.
- We wanna go with Nick.

01:17:51.572 --> 01:17:53.301
Let us out.

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:58.542
Come on, slim, don't let him
push you around. Do it. Do it.

01:18:01.715 --> 01:18:04.377
Dag-bernit, I've had enough of this.

01:18:13.294 --> 01:18:16.457
- Come on, slim, they getting away.
- It won't turn over.

01:18:17.998 --> 01:18:20.489
I can't do anything about it.

01:18:20.668 --> 01:18:21.999
I'm sorry.

01:18:24.505 --> 01:18:27.838
Boy, it's true. Never a cop around
when you need one.

01:18:30.577 --> 01:18:32.238
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

01:18:37.618 --> 01:18:38.812
Bad! Hit you!

01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:47.353
- Geronimo!
- Geronimo!

01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:54.794
- Look, it's Elite Catering.
- This is Mom's party.

01:18:54.968 --> 01:18:56.435
Let's go.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.940
- Come on.
- I want some cotton candy.

01:19:10.384 --> 01:19:12.511
- Got you.
- Run! Save yourself!

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.247
Wait. Wait.

01:19:15.422 --> 01:19:17.390
At least slow down.

01:19:20.694 --> 01:19:23.060
You two are a peck of trouble,
you know that?

01:19:28.602 --> 01:19:30.763
Wait. I'm trying to protect you.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:33.939
You're going down, sucker.

01:19:35.109 --> 01:19:36.906
Get off me.

01:19:52.259 --> 01:19:54.056
Come on. Come on.

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:59.130
I'm gonna give you a knuckle sandwich.

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:04.634
- Let me at him. Get your hands off me.
- What's wrong with you two?

01:20:04.905 --> 01:20:06.770
- He's a kidnapper!
- He's a kidnapper!

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.771
- He's a kidnapper!
- He's a kidnapper!

01:20:08.942 --> 01:20:11.604
- Let me at him.
- Yeah. Nick, get him!

01:20:11.779 --> 01:20:12.939
Police.

01:20:25.259 --> 01:20:27.090
Mom!

01:20:27.261 --> 01:20:29.923
Lindsey, honey.

01:20:30.097 --> 01:20:34.227
Oh, baby, Mommy was so worried
about you. Are you okay?

01:20:34.401 --> 01:20:37.199
Yep. Eight o'clock, just like you said.

01:20:37.371 --> 01:20:39.532
Now, where is your brother and that Nick?

01:20:40.808 --> 01:20:42.673
I left them by the ice-skating rink.

01:20:42.843 --> 01:20:46.609
Now, I need to know what's going
on here, and I want the truth.

01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:51.877
The truth? I don't think there's time
for the truth.

01:20:58.292 --> 01:20:59.691
Get him!

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.623
I'm the good guy. Get him.

01:21:02.095 --> 01:21:04.859
Get your hands off me,
you stinking snowman.

01:21:06.099 --> 01:21:07.862
Wait a minute. You don't understand.

01:21:08.035 --> 01:21:12.972
I got permission from his mother
to bring him here. Kevin, tell him.

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:15.165
Kevin!

01:21:21.682 --> 01:21:23.650
Let me go. He needs his inhaler.

01:21:24.418 --> 01:21:25.908
Kevin. Kevin.

01:21:26.086 --> 01:21:28.247
Oh, no. Come on, man.

01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:30.253
Come on, Kevin.

01:21:30.424 --> 01:21:32.255
Come on, man. Breathe.

01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:34.257
Breathe, breathe.

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:36.756
Come on. Come on, breathe.

01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:39.098
Kevin.

01:21:40.434 --> 01:21:42.334
Kevin.

01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:51.235
Don't you ever scare me
like that again. You hear me?

01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:54.073
Don't you ever do that.

01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:57.877
Maybe it won't be so bad
to turn out like you after all.

01:22:00.053 --> 01:22:01.486
Kevin!

01:22:01.655 --> 01:22:04.852
- Mommy.
- Oh, Kevin, honey, come here.

01:22:05.025 --> 01:22:08.119
I don't know what Mommy was
thinking. I should've come home.

01:22:08.295 --> 01:22:10.593
- Are you okay?
- It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

01:22:10.764 --> 01:22:12.231
Yeah, it's okay. He's fine.

01:22:13.066 --> 01:22:14.761
You call this fine?

01:22:14.935 --> 01:22:17.096
Look at this. This is a catastrophe.

01:22:17.271 --> 01:22:19.000
No, Suzanne, you don't understand.

01:22:19.172 --> 01:22:22.073
- I mean, we... Me and the kids...
- Nick, please.

01:22:22.242 --> 01:22:23.903
It's bad enough as it is.

01:22:27.814 --> 01:22:30.044
I really wanted to believe in you.

01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:35.577
Ma'am, did this man have permission
to watch your children?

01:22:40.394 --> 01:22:42.294
Yes.

01:22:43.897 --> 01:22:46.764
But it was a mistake,
and it won't happen again.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:55.173
Come on, you guys.

01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:57.233
- Suzanne, no.
- But, Mom...

01:22:57.411 --> 01:23:00.505
I don't wanna hear it.
I'm not in the mood to argue. Let's go.

01:23:00.681 --> 01:23:02.410
- Mommy.
- Let's go.

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:04.175
Suzanne.

01:23:13.427 --> 01:23:14.826
Nick.

01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:17.424
Listen...

01:23:17.898 --> 01:23:20.128
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:24.930
If you're serious about heading home,
I'd be proud to give you a lift.

01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.466
Appreciate that, Big Al.

01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:29.632
I got my truck right...

01:23:30.277 --> 01:23:34.304
Hey, what are you doing, you turkey?
You can't tow my truck!

01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:37.382
Put it down. I'm here.
Put it down right now.

01:23:37.551 --> 01:23:39.212
Officers, arrest this man!

01:23:47.394 --> 01:23:49.191
Yo, Nick.

01:23:49.696 --> 01:23:51.288
Excuse me.

01:23:51.465 --> 01:23:52.693
Hey, Nick, remember me?

01:23:52.866 --> 01:23:55.630
I'm in here with a mint stuck to my head.

01:23:56.203 --> 01:23:57.534
Hey, brother.

01:23:57.704 --> 01:24:01.470
What are you moping about?
You should be celebrating.

01:24:01.642 --> 01:24:04.270
You finally got rid
of that highfalutin woman...

01:24:04.444 --> 01:24:07.743
with that smart-mouth little girl
and that sickly boy.

01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:12.980
Yes, sir. It's New Year's Eve,
and you are free at last.

01:24:13.153 --> 01:24:15.087
Time to hit some clubs.

01:24:15.589 --> 01:24:18.649
And they got some foxy ladies here.

01:24:18.825 --> 01:24:21.316
Did you know Vancouver
produces more Playmates...

01:24:21.495 --> 01:24:23.554
than any other city in the world?

01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:25.561
Let's go, player.

01:24:42.683 --> 01:24:45.413
Thanks, Dad, that was a lot of fun.

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.415
Hey, Nick.

01:25:21.588 --> 01:25:23.988
You know what they call
a 50-year-old bachelor?

01:25:24.491 --> 01:25:25.890
What?

01:25:26.059 --> 01:25:27.720
Lonely.

01:25:50.517 --> 01:25:52.382
Who is it?

01:25:53.086 --> 01:25:54.314
Room service.

01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:58.958
We didn't order anything,
and that won't change.

01:25:59.326 --> 01:26:01.317
Let me explain, okay?

01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:05.226
I know you're upset,
and you have a right to be...

01:26:05.398 --> 01:26:08.424
- but there's a good reason why all...
- Nick, they're kids.

01:26:08.602 --> 01:26:11.298
They don't need reasons and excuses.
They need a man.

01:26:11.605 --> 01:26:14.597
So whatever it is that you have to say,
just drop it.

01:26:14.775 --> 01:26:18.006
I've been down this road before,
and I'm not going back.

01:26:18.178 --> 01:26:20.339
- Good night.
- Wait, wait.

01:26:22.883 --> 01:26:25.283
Just let me say goodbye to the kids.

01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:28.014
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:31.655
Please.

01:26:37.898 --> 01:26:39.365
Make it quick.

01:26:41.034 --> 01:26:42.729
- Nick!
- Nick!

01:26:42.903 --> 01:26:46.600
Hey, how you guys doing? You all right?

01:26:46.773 --> 01:26:50.038
I knew you'd come back.
Lindsey didn't think so, but I did.

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:53.373
Boy, you know I'm gonna be
your friend always, right?

01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:57.210
But Mama's not gonna date you anymore.

01:26:57.684 --> 01:26:58.878
Listen, you guys.

01:27:01.054 --> 01:27:03.022
Up here.

01:27:05.592 --> 01:27:09.995
Your mother is a very,
very wonderful lady.

01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:14.593
And she's gonna be dating guys
that are much better than me.

01:27:14.768 --> 01:27:18.670
So you guys gotta stop
chasing them off, okay?

01:27:18.839 --> 01:27:21.000
And stay away from their cars.

01:27:21.174 --> 01:27:23.005
Unless they're bulletproof.

01:27:26.279 --> 01:27:29.680
How do I know we'll ever see you again?

01:27:31.318 --> 01:27:33.286
I got something for you.

01:27:33.787 --> 01:27:38.724
I want you to hold on
to my man Satch, okay?

01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:41.925
That's until I see you again.

01:27:43.163 --> 01:27:44.892
All right...

01:27:45.065 --> 01:27:46.430
I gotta get going.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.228
Do you have to?

01:27:49.402 --> 01:27:52.200
Yeah, little man, I think so.

01:27:52.806 --> 01:27:55.798
Look, I got one more thing for you.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.410
There you go.

01:28:03.683 --> 01:28:05.810
And for you.

01:28:06.586 --> 01:28:09.180
Now you have blingage.

01:28:11.825 --> 01:28:14.055
I love you guys.

01:28:19.432 --> 01:28:21.900
See you later, okay?

01:28:22.068 --> 01:28:23.660
All right.

01:28:29.009 --> 01:28:32.775
Suzanne, I'm sorry about
what happened today.

01:28:32.946 --> 01:28:35.039
I really am.

01:28:35.882 --> 01:28:38.248
I just wanna know if
we can still be friends.

01:28:39.085 --> 01:28:41.417
Nick, I don't think that's gonna happen.

01:28:45.058 --> 01:28:47.083
Okay.

01:28:49.062 --> 01:28:50.825
Nick?

01:28:51.965 --> 01:28:54.126
We can't be friends...

01:28:55.468 --> 01:28:58.995
because I wanna be so much more
than just your friend.

01:28:59.873 --> 01:29:01.465
What?

01:29:01.641 --> 01:29:03.541
Come here.

01:29:03.710 --> 01:29:05.268
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:29:07.047 --> 01:29:08.036
Hey.

01:29:16.022 --> 01:29:18.456
It's New Year's.
Aren't you supposed to kiss her?

01:29:26.733 --> 01:29:29.361
I love a happy ending.

01:29:31.538 --> 01:29:33.005
Yeah!
