00:01.400 --> 00:03.767
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.120 --> 00:06.566
- You're The Clairvoyant?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.642
He let his emotions get the best of him.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.285
He wasn't gonna stop, Skye.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.771
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.285
I'm worried
he killed the wrong man.

00:13.360 --> 00:14.600
The Clairvoyant doesn't have abilities.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.045
He has security clearance.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.286
He's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.921
Why would May have an unauthorized
encrypted hardline in the cockpit?

00:22.760 --> 00:24.364
Put it down, May!

00:24.440 --> 00:27.011
Who do you answer to?
Who's the real Clairvoyant?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.241
Where are we going?

00:29.320 --> 00:30.890
I don't know. I didn't do it!

00:30.960 --> 00:33.770
When that plane touches down,
take out everyone on board.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.444
Except Agent Coulson.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.680
He's mine.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.761
Tower, this is S.H.I.E.L.D. to ECHO-3.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.526
I've got a pair of UAVs on my six.
These friendlies? Over.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.970
They're gonna hit my jet wash
if they get any closer.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.680
What the heck is that?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.324
- Drop the weapon!
-Coulson...

02:08.440 --> 02:10.568
Drop the damn weapon and kick it over
to the stairs, May. Now!

02:11.560 --> 02:12.641
Now!

02:14.480 --> 02:16.801
Now back the hell up. Over there.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.051
Talk. Tell us where
you rerouted the plane.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.805
- I didn't set this new course. I swear!
-Don't lie to me!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.490
The plane just turned around
for God's sakes!

02:33.560 --> 02:34.721
How is this happening then?

02:34.840 --> 02:37.491
HQ can override automated
control of the avionics.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.050
Take us anywhere they want.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.121
Let me check the instrument panel

02:40.200 --> 02:41.247
-and I'll be able to...
-No way!

02:41.320 --> 02:42.810
You're not going anywhere
till you explain what...

02:42.920 --> 02:44.331
It's not me!

02:44.400 --> 02:46.323
Why did you have
an encrypted hardline?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.164
And tried to shoot me when we found it!

02:48.240 --> 02:50.004
- Let's take a breath...
-Let's not!

02:50.600 --> 02:54.400
It was a dedicated channel
to Director Fury.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.926
- That's the truth.
- Director Fury?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.364
I haven't been able to get
him on the line for weeks.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.602
- You were reporting to him?
-That's all I can tell you.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.047
- Oh, just come out with it!
-That's all you can tell us?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.286
I'm under orders.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.569
Fury will tell you.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.450
What, was this an order?
To shoot me in the bloody head?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.681
Hold on.

03:13.640 --> 03:15.608
We're not headed to Fury anymore.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.523
I don't know where we're headed.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.251
And I can't get Fury on the line
because Fitz cut the line.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.526
Skye told me to.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.807
Someone was talking to
The Clairvoyant, the real Clairvoyant.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.120
You were in the walls, Fitz.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.806
You wanna explain why you were
tampering with the plane's sat cables?

03:27.880 --> 03:31.202
Sure, because that's relevant.
Don't try and turn this around on me!

03:34.120 --> 03:35.201
Fitz...

03:38.040 --> 03:40.122
I was trying to speak
to Simmons at the Hub.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.846
You needed an encrypted line?
What's so secret that...

03:42.960 --> 03:44.041
You tell me!

03:44.160 --> 03:46.845
Simmons and I know you two have been
whispering, keeping things from us

03:46.920 --> 03:48.410
about the drug that saved your life.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.642
Simmons is just trying to figure
out how the whole thing works!

03:53.840 --> 03:56.525
Fitz, who is she talking to?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.411
- Fitz, open the door.
-No way.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.481
Not until we sort this out.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.641
- I'm not opening anything.
-Open the door.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.200
We can't get anything sorted
until you open the damn door.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.606
Skye, get your laptop hooked up
to our systems.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.445
See if you can pull up
any S.H.I.E.L.D. communications.

04:16.519 --> 04:19.329
I wanna know where this plane
is headed, and why.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.925
- Coulson...
-You stay put!

04:30.840 --> 04:32.649
Now tell me who Simmons is talking to?

04:32.720 --> 04:35.690
'Cause if it isn't someone we trust,
she's in serious danger.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.805
Agent Simmons.

04:45.440 --> 04:48.011
I was wondering where you snuck off to.
Busy?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.208
Yes. But that's okay.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.409
It's noisy here today.
Lot of guys in action mode.

04:53.560 --> 04:54.641
I asked around.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.290
Guess it's a Level 8 operation
of some sort.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.322
Mmm.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.805
I was surprised to have this room
to myself.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.891
So, what are you working on?

05:03.880 --> 05:04.881
Wow.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.327
Coulson's team is awfully secretive,
even for this organization.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.606
Are you hiding something, Agent?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.530
No, it's just nothing important.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.647
I hope not.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.370
'Cause I remember us
tracking down a drug

05:16.440 --> 05:19.284
that brought a girl back from the brink,
and that was real important.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.364
Yes, I know.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.364
Come to think of it, I don't remember
seeing it in the dispatches.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.011
Or you mentioning it when Agent Blake
got his ribs caved in.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.127
I wasn't in a position...

05:29.200 --> 05:31.328
'Cause if you had the means
and you didn't use them,

05:31.400 --> 05:32.845
that blood is all over your hands, too.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.081
I know.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.291
I'm trying.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.807
Look, men died to keep this secret.
We don't understand why.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.571
So we wanted to keep our
research in-house, for safety.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.927
- Research?
-That's hit a dead end.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.683
I'm uploading Skye's blood scans.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.604
I would like to contact Agent Weaver
at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy, covertly.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.444
For a little help.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.204
But we must keep this between us.

06:06.280 --> 06:09.124
Please. I don't want any trouble.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.565
You're Level 5?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.651
My Level 6 clearance gives me
access to the Holobox.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.131
Secure line.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.804
But we can't sneak that in here?
Can we?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.769
Agent Hand seems to be
keeping everyone busy.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.763
We'll be good.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.367
But, if we get questioned, let me talk.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.290
You're a surprisingly bad liar,
Agent Simmons.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.842
--I know. But I'm getting better at it.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.246
What do you mean, "noise?"

06:36.320 --> 06:37.560
--I mean literally, noise.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.449
Across every S.H.I.E.L.D.
communication channel.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.010
Some sort of blanket signal.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.923
- Encoded data, maybe?
- I think so.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.047
You wanna fill us in?

06:44.160 --> 06:47.004
We root you out, a mole,
suddenly our plane shuts down,

06:47.080 --> 06:48.445
our communications jammed.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.204
I don't know what's happening,
I wish I did.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.084
- You have to believe me.
-No, I don't.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.527
Do you read, 616?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.170
Where is that coming from?

06:57.160 --> 06:59.686
- Close.
-Enemy aircraft on my tail! Over.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.525
- Garrett?
-Coulson, I'm under attack. Drones.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.848
Repeat, S.H.I.E.L.D. drones
are on my ass.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.888
- We're not getting along. Do you copy?
- Copy.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.810
Garrett, what's happening?
We've lost control of our aircraft.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.927
Hell if I know.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.651
Tell me you got guns on that thing.
I'm coming to you!

07:16.560 --> 07:17.561
--Ohh!

07:20.040 --> 07:23.123
Fitz, can you manually wire
the guns to weapons control?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.441
Bypass our system?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.409
If I have cables long enough, yes.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.409
Skye, decode the signal.
We need to get ahead of this.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.482
I don't want any more surprises today.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.122
- What happened?
-She's a sleeper.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.770
I mean, the other kind of sleeper.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.005
Wait, what are you saying?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.481
She's been reporting on us
this whole time.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.723
Controls are live, sir.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.041
Garrett, what's your 20?

07:59.120 --> 08:03.011
I'll be on top of you in seconds.
At your 10 o'clock.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.969
- Guns hot?
-Warming up.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.761
He needs to pull up, sir.
Hey, hey, Garrett, pull up!

08:10.840 --> 08:11.966
He knows what he's doing.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.770
- Damn it!
- That was Joanie.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.684
Any thoughts on Chachi?
Now it knows you're here.

08:26.760 --> 08:27.921
Wanna roll over, play dead?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.970
Okay, Phil, but you better make it quick.
I'm running on fumes.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.525
I'll pull up even with your six.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.648
- Better not miss.
-Copy that.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.966
Ready when you are, Boss.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.009
"Play dead." What does that mean?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.329
It means I better not miss.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.806
Booyah!

08:55.160 --> 08:56.844
Drones are down.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.770
Agent Garrett's alive and docking
with S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.410
I suggest we send more men.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.005
Shoot that airplane out of the sky.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.283
No. We couldn't seize automated
control of Garrett's jet,

09:06.360 --> 09:07.486
so I wrote it off as a loss.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.641
But now that he's with Coulson,

09:08.720 --> 09:10.484
we can cross him off with the rest
when they land.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.210
Preserve the aircraft.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.042
You got something to say, Agent Shaw?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.804
Apologies, ma'am.
I'm just having a hard time

09:17.880 --> 09:19.644
killing the people
we once called friends.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.290
Once that encoded transmission
went out, everything changed.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.125
You understand that, don't you?

09:29.200 --> 09:31.168
We swore allegiance to each other.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.163
And today, that loyalty will be tested.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.006
If you waver,

09:36.000 --> 09:37.684
you die.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.646
It's a simple message repeated,
semantic encoding.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.245
I needed to find the mnemonic key.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.084
It should only take me
a minute more to decipher.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.162
Can I ask the obvious question?
What the hell?

09:52.360 --> 09:55.170
We don't know. We don't even know
where our plane is headed.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.611
I saw your trajectory.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.523
You're being tractor-beamed
straight to the Hub.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.204
Those drones were launched
out of there, for sure.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.887
Victoria Hand.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.207
Hand? It can't be.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.087
- Can't be what now?
-The Clairvoyant.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.125
I thought Ward capped that guy.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.168
I don't believe the man Ward killed
was The Clairvoyant.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.322
I think he was an unwitting decoy

10:13.400 --> 10:14.561
meant to end our investigation.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.166
That's a lot of trouble to go through
for a red herring, don't you think?

10:17.240 --> 10:19.049
Because The Clairvoyant
is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.081
Using high-level clearance
to stay ahead of us,

10:22.160 --> 10:24.083
make it seem like
she's got psychic abilities.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.164
She? You think Victoria Hand's
the Clairvoyant?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.120
I don't mean to pee in the punch bowl,

10:31.200 --> 10:32.884
but that doesn't make a lot of sense.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.769
I was stationed with Vic in Lisbon.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.969
She's a hard-ass and a buzzkill
at parties, I grant you,

10:38.040 --> 10:39.849
but you really think
she's capable of that?

10:39.920 --> 10:42.207
Excuse me, didn't she just try
to blow you out of the sky?

10:42.280 --> 10:44.123
Don't get me wrong,
she's definitely gone nuts,

10:44.200 --> 10:46.806
but her actions prove
she's not The Clairvoyant, right?

10:46.880 --> 10:49.770
I mean, if she's been hiding
in plain sight all this time,

10:49.840 --> 10:51.171
why reveal herself now?

10:51.800 --> 10:52.926
Guys...

11:06.920 --> 11:08.524
Well, I'll be...

11:17.440 --> 11:19.841
I thought HYDRA was defeated
after World War II.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.890
It was. S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded
in the wake of that victory.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.645
- And now they're back?
-HYDRA always comes back.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.927
Cut off a head,
two more will take its place.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.411
- Is it a head? I thought it was a limb.
-"Cut off a limb."

11:31.480 --> 11:32.720
-it's a head.
-But it was sent from

11:32.800 --> 11:36.043
a S.H.I.E.L.D. source. It's got to be
some sort of activation signal

11:36.120 --> 11:38.043
to HYDRA members within S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.087
Hand must be one of them.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.810
Okay, stop, Stop.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.008
What does that mean? In S.H.I.E.L.D.?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.486
Targeting Level 8 agents,
seizing power.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.840
Wonder how deep it goes.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.888
This signal is everywhere. Deep.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.531
- You know what this means?
-Yeah, we're screwed.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.886
We can't change course.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.122
And we have no idea
what's waiting for us at the Hub.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.247
The Hub.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.647
I say we blow a hole in the side
of this puppy and parachute out.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.924
Live to fight another day.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.206
We can't.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.044
It's a cherry ride, I'll give you that,

12:05.160 --> 12:06.491
but let's not just hand over the keys.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.325
Simmons is at the Hub.
We have to save her.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.411
Oh, crap, yeah. Trip's there, too.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.681
I don't mind saying,
I don't like the odds on this one.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.922
We should let your specialist
out of their cage.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.889
We can use every weapon we can get.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.041
We've gotta save her.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.043
So, we'll fly in there, face the music.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.687
Even if it is the HYDRA theme song.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.887
Agents Triplett and Simmons
are unaccounted for, ma'am.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.691
Searches are underway.
They don't have anywhere to go.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.888
Don't underestimate Coulson's people.
Tie up those loose ends.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.889
You're positive this line is secure?

12:48.960 --> 12:50.086
Yeah, but be quick.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.164
Nothing looks more guilty
than sneaking around.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.046
I sent her a request,
she must not have...

12:57.120 --> 12:59.043
Agent Weaver, thank you for joining me.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.088
Jemma, thank God you're still alive.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.241
What, what's wrong?

13:02.320 --> 13:03.924
Is the Hub still secure?
Are you with your team?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.048
Get somewhere safe and lock the door.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.360
What's happening?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.761
Have your commander...
The Academy is under siege...

13:09.840 --> 13:11.604
We don't know how long HYDRA's
been inside S.H.I.E.L.D.,

13:11.680 --> 13:15.048
-but they are taking control!
-HYDRA? What? Where?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.886
Everywhere. Among us.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.611
If you survive,
you know where to find me.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.650
Jemma, don't trust anyone.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.001
What are you doing?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.927
What the lady said to do.
Locking the door.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.088
- Let me out.
- Go ahead.

13:35.360 --> 13:36.566
The door won't hold
if they come looking,

13:36.640 --> 13:38.802
but they won't come around this way
for a little while.

13:38.920 --> 13:39.967
I'm staying.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.281
How do I know I can trust you?

13:46.600 --> 13:48.967
Because I'm trustworthy.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.925
You're the one who works for the
zombie robot back from the dead.

13:59.920 --> 14:00.967
Take it.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.607
If you try to kill me with it,
I'll know I can't trust you.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.969
Now, fire that thing back up.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.686
Let's see if we can get our friends
on the line.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.127
Can't wait to tell them the good news.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.206
Coulson said you're an informant.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.691
Wanna elaborate on that?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.768
No, I don't.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.802
Damn ICER.
 My head's killing me.

14:32.880 --> 14:34.211
I deserve to know.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.285
Don't start with that.
We do our jobs, end of story.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.526
I can't tell you any more until
Fury gives the go-ahead.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.681
You're good.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.168
I mean, I always heard you were good.

14:52.240 --> 14:53.571
But, man,

14:55.160 --> 14:56.810
playing us this whole time?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.486
Conning me? Coulson...

14:59.560 --> 15:02.245
I wasn't playing anyone.
I had your backs.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.210
And reported on us behind them.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.882
You know, you always said to keep
my emotions in check,

15:09.960 --> 15:11.610
but this is some next level...

15:11.720 --> 15:13.006
And you should have listened.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.080
You killed a man in cold blood.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.090
Let your emotions get the best of you.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.322
It was to protect our team
from a monster.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.442
It was to protect her.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.361
Which would be okay,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.647
if you hadn't shot the wrong guy.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.525
Fitz repaired your direct line.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.611
If you have the ability to make this right,
now's the time.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.250
'Cause you can't make it worse.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.246
I have orders not to do this
with anyone else present.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.444
They're taking out our guns.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.171
Get Director Fury on the line,

16:00.240 --> 16:02.129
or I'll march you out there first.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.881
Sir!

16:09.400 --> 16:11.004
- What is going on?
-A whole lot.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.127
Who is shooting at us?

16:12.240 --> 16:13.810
Come here, let me catch you up.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.451
Apparently, Agent Hand
is The Clairvoyant,

16:16.520 --> 16:17.806
so chew on that first.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.727
Agent Melinda May. Voice command.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.725
Emergency Protocol One.
Emergency Protocol One.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.526
Hello?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.891
This is an X1-0 straight connection
to Director Fury's personal line.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.291
Where is he?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.045
Director Fury is dead.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.251
Can that be true? About Fury?

17:13.319 --> 17:15.288
Man was my S.O., Coulson's, too.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.806
Proved himself more than once
to be a hard man to kill.

17:18.960 --> 17:22.362
That sound outside
doesn't bode well, though.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.964
Is there anything on this plane
you don't want them

17:24.040 --> 17:25.883
to get their hands on?

17:30.760 --> 17:32.808
That was his direct line, Phil.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.690
So it's real?
That means it's just you and me.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.649
Unless there were other parties
you reported to.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.171
There weren't.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.045
Then come out with it.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.168
Fury's gone and we're being
shot at by our own people.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.241
Fury knew you'd want me to join up.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.890
Asked me to keep an eye on you.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.367
Looking for what?

17:53.040 --> 17:55.611
Signs of physical
or mental deterioration.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.405
To keep him updated. It's that simple.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.045
Did you know about T.A.H.I.T.I.?

18:03.160 --> 18:06.209
How could you do that to me?
After all we've been through?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.611
The years we spent together in ops?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.762
He said it was essential.
You couldn't know.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.208
The time I spent sifting
through the ashes with you in Bahrain?

18:13.320 --> 18:15.163
I gave you a second chance
when I assembled this team.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.203
I assembled this team.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.407
What?

18:20.960 --> 18:24.248
I evaluated what was needed
and I gave the assessment to Fury,

18:24.320 --> 18:27.324
and he gave you
the parameters for your unit.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.049
What was needed, May?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.409
Someone who could repair your body,

18:35.480 --> 18:37.767
a technician
who could reprogram your brain,

18:37.840 --> 18:40.923
and a specialist to help me
put you down if it had to be done.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.651
But I didn't do it for Fury.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.882
I did it for you. To protect you.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.925
You mean a lot to me. A lot.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.051
To hear you were dead...

18:57.080 --> 19:00.129
You may not believe me,
but that's the truth.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.811
And I have nothing to do
with The Clairvoyant,

19:02.880 --> 19:05.451
or this HYDRA threat we're up against.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.808
Hopefully, this helps prove that.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.525
I wanna believe you.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.929
But you've used that against me
this whole time.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.810
They've stopped firing.
No clear shots through the windows.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.649
They wanna preserve the aircraft.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.006
A surgical strike team is next.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.684
Fitz cut the hydraulics
on the cargo ramp.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.047
- They'll have to pry it open.
-That won't hold them long.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.522
We need to plan to get out of here
with whatever we can take with us.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.931
About that...

19:35.000 --> 19:39.403
The 084 specs, Asgardian
weaponry, portal creation,

19:39.480 --> 19:40.891
Donnie's weather machine.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.167
If they get their hands on
Gravitonium in the Fridge...

19:43.280 --> 19:45.681
It's below the Fridge. No records.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.125
Okay. But on the off chance,

19:47.200 --> 19:49.851
we'd give them the designs
to weaponize it.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.891
The drug from T.A.H.I.T.I., sir? All here.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.042
If HYDRA is really about
to seize this plane...

19:56.120 --> 19:57.167
We should wipe the system.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.969
I'm backing it up on this
hard drive to keep our edge.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.042
Then do it. Scrub the plane clean.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.600
- It'll take some time.
-We're working on buying you some.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.804
I'm telling you, this signal
is clogging everything up.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.167
--Something terrible has happened.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.650
Freeze! Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

20:35.040 --> 20:37.008
Go! Go! Move! Move!

20:41.480 --> 20:42.481
Move up! Move up!

20:58.680 --> 20:59.886
Going up.

21:12.760 --> 21:15.764
It's called a Mouse Hole.
Cuts through anything really.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.968
I designed it a year ago
and submitted it for testing,

21:18.040 --> 21:19.644
but it never reached distribution.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.643
Top agents always hog the good stuff.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.643
You're right, the hard drive's safer
in your hands.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.888
You haven't taught me
how to hold up under torture yet.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.485
We'll get to that, it's real fun.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.324
All right, here's where we split.
Skye and Ward...

21:29.400 --> 21:30.447
Heading to the Nerve Center.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.091
Disable their systems, most importantly
their control of our plane.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.241
- Copy that.
-Remember,

21:34.320 --> 21:35.560
these agents are under orders.

21:35.640 --> 21:36.801
Use ICERs only.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.041
We'll find Simmons, get her out.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.246
We should go straight for Hand.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.328
HYDRA's always talking about
getting their heads cut off, right?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.448
Saving Simmons and Triplett,
that's our priority.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.522
I agree, and that's how I'd get it done.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.365
- Hope you have a better plan.
-Phil, I can help...

21:48.440 --> 21:51.125
We need your help,
but the cuffs stay on.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.691
The rest of your possibly
very short lives

22:08.760 --> 22:10.888
hinges on this moment.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.850
HYDRA has successfully
infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.046
at the highest level.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.929
It only took seven decades.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.082
And today is our coming out party.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.207
We have the support

22:20.280 --> 22:22.851
of the Level 9 and Level 10 agents.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.641
And those who have resisted
HYDRA have been crossed off.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.569
Director Fury included.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.447
I'm here to offer you a choice,
and a simple one at that.

22:35.320 --> 22:39.644
Either swear unwavering loyalty
to HYDRA right now for all time,

22:40.960 --> 22:42.610
or share Fury's fate.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.283
I won't wait long.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.290
Cross us off,
and one of you goes, too.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.611
Right answer.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.650
The number of people I trust
is now seven.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.085
Where are we on the roundup?

23:09.200 --> 23:11.407
We're moving all agents below
Level 5 to East Holding.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.528
I have men monitoring microphones
placed in most of the rooms.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.166
- And our strike team?
-Has stormed the plane, yes.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.481
That was a test?

23:18.560 --> 23:20.210
That very few have passed.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.722
I thought we were dead.
You're not HYDRA. Thank God.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.165
Don't celebrate just yet.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.083
We may not be HYDRA.

23:27.160 --> 23:30.209
But your friend Coulson? He is.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.446
Oh,
they captured Agent Coulson.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.090
And The Cavalry herself.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.049
Go upstairs, they'll need assistance.
They're headed...

23:51.280 --> 23:52.327
Here.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.527
We caught 'em,
the slippery bastards.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.887
Agent May took one of mine in the arm.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.365
Softy, there, wouldn't let her bleed out.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.521
You need medical assistance?

24:02.680 --> 24:03.841
Just your sidearm.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.807
Okay, come on, Simmons.
Where are you?

24:08.880 --> 24:10.370
- Report back to me.
-Yes, ma'am.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.287
What?

24:12.360 --> 24:13.964
We've searched the plane, ma'am.
No sign of them.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.451
They were on board when it landed.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.649
We are tearing this plane apart.
They must've snuck off somehow.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.721
Check the tunnels.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.643
I want two squads
posted in every corridor.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.041
Capture who you can, but you have
permission to use lethal force.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.201
Yes, ma'am.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.362
You were right, we should've blown
that plane out of the sky.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.681
Are you mad?
How can you be saying this?

24:29.760 --> 24:32.001
HYDRA won't show mercy.
Neither can we.

24:32.080 --> 24:35.846
There's no way Coulson is HYDRA.
He is a good man. A friend.

24:35.920 --> 24:37.046
He's a liar!

24:39.280 --> 24:41.567
Agent Blake came to me
with his suspicions

24:41.640 --> 24:43.165
that Coulson and the other Level 8's

24:43.240 --> 24:44.685
were involved in some sort
of conspiracy.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.846
Then Coulson sent him on an op
that put him in the ICU.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.402
Coulson is not capable
of what you're insinuating.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.209
Agent Jacobson, Coulson's crimes?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.248
Recruiting known enemies
of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

24:55.320 --> 24:57.482
disobeying a direct order,
multiple counts,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.364
violation of international law.

24:59.440 --> 25:02.762
To rescue our beloved Professor Hall,
who ended up dead by his hand.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.889
Failure to report the crimes
of his protégé Akela Amador.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.850
Whose same technology somehow
ended up in the head of Mr. Peterson,

25:08.920 --> 25:10.081
and you know his crimes.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.005
You helped us save Coulson
from The Clairvoyant.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.923
Yet, when we found
this brain-dead Clairvoyant,

25:15.000 --> 25:16.286
Coulson's man Ward shot him

25:16.360 --> 25:18.169
before we could learn
a single thing about him.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.408
The lies add up, Agent Simmons.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.290
Are you telling me he's never
kept a secret from you?

25:24.280 --> 25:28.126
The worst thing you can do right
now is to underestimate HYDRA.

25:28.200 --> 25:32.410
They hide in plain sight,
they earn our trust, our sympathy.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.845
They make us like them.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.843
And when you hesitate, they strike.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.567
If we're to survive,
we must learn to strike first.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.565
Lethal force is authorized.
Shoot to kill.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.121
Damn.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.483
The processing center's
at the end of that hall.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.646
Give me your ICER.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.724
- What are you gonna do?
-Pave the way for you.

26:06.800 --> 26:10.043
- There's, like, 100 guys out there.
-Twelve.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.088
Level 5 foot soldiers,
basic armor package,

26:12.160 --> 26:13.571
and no other way through.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.005
The others are depending on us.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.445
But it's suicide.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.490
Not if I don't die.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.889
- And if I do...
-Slow down.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.161
Maybe I deserve to.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.047
I killed an innocent man, Skye.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.845
You didn't know.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.930
You thought you were
doing the right thing.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.047
You thought he was going to...

26:35.160 --> 26:37.367
To hurt you.

26:58.080 --> 27:03.041
If we make it out of this,
maybe we can grab a drink.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.360
You and me.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.965
- Are you...
-Remember in that bar in Dublin?

27:08.040 --> 27:10.884
You offered to talk.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.564
I didn't wanna talk.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.450
I needed to keep things
compartmentalized.

27:15.560 --> 27:16.971
Like with May?

27:20.440 --> 27:23.205
I'm not an idiot. We live on the same
plane together, for God's sake.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.408
Well, with her, I knew I could.

27:26.120 --> 27:29.044
With you? I didn't wanna risk it.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.727
I was offering to talk, Ward.
Not to have sex with you.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.007
I'm not saying that. I'm saying

27:36.120 --> 27:38.327
I want a chance to take you up on it.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.090
To have that talk.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.290
Look, I know I'm not that guy.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.244
I'm too locked down, too boring, but...

27:49.320 --> 27:52.369
When we make it out of this,

27:52.480 --> 27:55.086
yes, let's have a drink.

28:09.760 --> 28:13.287
You said you might die,
so, what the hell?

28:15.680 --> 28:17.444
Lock the door behind me.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.441
Ahhh!

29:19.520 --> 29:21.045
Hey.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.289
You should really look up the word
"boring" in a dictionary.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.362
You ready to hack the system?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.721
Who said anything about hacking?

29:39.200 --> 29:40.281
There. Agent Hand.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.567
Outside the East Wing Situation Room.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.244
This is definitely a situation.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.527
Simmons... We don't move
until we find Simmons.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.204
I'll say it again, best bet to save her?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.521
Use the ventilation system
to get above the Sit Room.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.404
Drop down using Fitz's
sweet little Mouse Hole

29:52.480 --> 29:54.926
and put two bullets through
Victoria Hand's heart.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.128
- It's an option, sir.
-Without questioning?

29:57.200 --> 29:58.406
Questioning what?

29:58.480 --> 30:00.801
Whether she wants to kill us
fast or slow?

30:00.880 --> 30:02.644
Last time we did that,
we shot the wrong man.

30:02.720 --> 30:04.210
Because she wanted us to.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.450
Phil, this is a battle
for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s soul,

30:07.520 --> 30:09.329
and we're on the front lines.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.243
History will remember us this day.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.085
That's right. It's for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s soul.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.924
And murder without consideration is a...

30:16.040 --> 30:17.644
Consideration? Consider this!

30:17.720 --> 30:19.404
She had one of my men killed

30:19.480 --> 30:21.767
with a bomb rigged to his gas pedal.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.325
Two other two were floating
in the hotel pool,

30:23.400 --> 30:24.890
and they weren't doing the backstroke.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.962
But we can just as easily ICE her.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.441
You don't put someone like her on ice.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.488
She had Skye shot in the stomach.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.729
In the stomach,
because she was curious.

30:34.800 --> 30:39.044
Mike Peterson burned alive
and turned into some kind of freak.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.521
She tortured you
using the same machine

30:41.600 --> 30:44.126
she used to brainwash that bitch
in the flower dress.

30:44.200 --> 30:48.125
And right now, she's probably
doing the same to Agent Simmons.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.924
Oh, I've considered it plenty, my friend.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.685
No, Simmons will be fine.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.410
Just being realistic, kid.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.845
I never mentioned that.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.083
I'm telling you,
killing her quick would be a mercy.

31:00.440 --> 31:04.650
I never said Raina had been
inside the machine.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.484
I never told that to anybody.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.562
I must've read it in a report, then.

31:08.640 --> 31:09.766
You weren't with us.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.844
The point is, how many more
have to suffer before Vic gets hers?

31:12.920 --> 31:15.287
- You showed up right after.
-What are you driving at?

31:15.360 --> 31:17.601
After Skye was shot,
Quinn said it was so

31:17.680 --> 31:20.286
I would lead The Clairvoyant to the cure.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.529
That's exactly what I did.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.125
I walked you right in there with me.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.926
Phil, look,
it's been a rough day, I get it.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.686
But you need to take a second and...

31:42.480 --> 31:44.005
Damn it.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.242
- Freeze! Don't move.
- Hands where I can see them.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.606
Easy, fellas.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.330
Take Agent Garrett into custody!

31:49.440 --> 31:51.761
He's the murderer they
call The Clairvoyant. He's a traitor!

31:52.120 --> 31:53.531
Gentlemen.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.803
I know Agent Sitwell was
in charge of filling your ranks,

31:56.880 --> 31:59.360
so at least a few of you
know what to do in this situation.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.200
Anytime, boys.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.007
Hail HYDRA.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.445
Hail HYDRA!

32:26.000 --> 32:27.923
Those three men in your unit?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.564
Guess they asked the wrong questions?

32:32.240 --> 32:34.163
Until today, it was all about
keeping the secret.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.765
Are you gonna kill us?

32:36.640 --> 32:38.483
That wasn't my plan, really.

32:39.840 --> 32:43.003
If it was, I could've done that
any time I wanted.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.730
No, Coulson and I go way back.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.886
Back to the days when
Fury was teaching us tactics.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.521
Clearing corners.
Slicing the pie. Remember, Phil?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.284
Fury would bury you for this.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.046
Probably.

32:57.720 --> 33:01.691
Instead, he'll just have to
roll over in his grave.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.331
He must've uncovered our secret.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.731
Top brass did what they had to do.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.691
Explains why we've suddenly
"come out of the shadows."

33:09.800 --> 33:11.802
Not a minor inconvenience, I might add.

33:11.880 --> 33:12.927
Top brass?

33:13.840 --> 33:15.683
Oh my, yes. Tip-top.

33:16.480 --> 33:18.721
We had a good thing going, too.

33:18.800 --> 33:22.282
Waving the S.H.I.E.L.D. flag
as hard as we could.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.441
I guess we'll be changing colors now.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.170
For HYDRA?

33:27.240 --> 33:29.208
You really believe all that crap?

33:29.280 --> 33:31.487
Spreading death and destruction?

33:31.560 --> 33:33.927
I wouldn't say I'm a true believer.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.882
Let's just say,
I felt the wind changing direction

33:36.960 --> 33:38.724
and swung my sail.

33:39.320 --> 33:40.685
You really should, too.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.491
I would die before serving HYDRA,
you sick son of a bitch.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.727
I hate to tell you,

33:46.800 --> 33:48.962
but you've been serving HYDRA
all along.

33:49.760 --> 33:51.649
I guess death is the only alternative.

33:52.600 --> 33:55.968
It's a sad thing. I consider you a friend.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.122
I was happy when I heard
you'd made it through.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.689
So happy you had me tortured
for three days to find out how they did it.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.206
I didn't enjoy that.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.169
Phil, this is me being honest.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.327
No, John,

34:07.440 --> 34:09.248
this is you being a psychopath.

34:11.679 --> 34:14.524
I know you'd follow him
to the grave, so...

34:19.280 --> 34:22.887
As for you, Agent Fitz?
You'll hold a very high rank

34:22.960 --> 34:26.248
on our tech division, if you volunteer.

34:26.320 --> 34:30.609
If not, you'll have no rank
and a lot of pain.

34:31.199 --> 34:36.206
Of course, either way,
your services will be required.

34:38.199 --> 34:41.090
You're gonna suffer
for what you've done.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.601
And I plan on being
a very big part of that.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.610
I like you, kid.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.643
All right, let them have it,

34:52.719 --> 34:55.199
but shoot that one in the kneecaps.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.890
Was that all of them?

35:02.800 --> 35:04.962
Wasn't as big as I thought...

35:57.160 --> 35:58.161
Ahhh!

36:04.560 --> 36:05.800
Coulson!

36:14.960 --> 36:18.282
- Hands up! Don't move!
-Drop your weapon.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.846
I'm not HYDRA.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.922
We heard. Everything.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.449
Who is? How deep does it go?

37:39.920 --> 37:44.050
Captain America has defeated
the Helicarriers at the Triskelion.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.764
But his status is unknown.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.763
And S.H.I.E.L.D. has fallen.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.924
HYDRA factions have taken control

37:51.000 --> 37:53.731
of our East African Headquarters
and the Treehouse.

37:53.800 --> 37:55.768
And those are just the ones we know of.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.002
It's gonna be a scramble, a power grab.

37:58.080 --> 38:01.402
I'll head to the Fridge.
At least that facility is secure.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.050
I don't need to remind you
how imperative it is

38:03.120 --> 38:04.121
that it stay that way.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.761
And I'll find Agent Garrett the smallest,
darkest cell in the Ice Box.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.844
I'd like to turn the key
on that cell myself.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.570
If you don't mind, sir.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.887
He was my S.O.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.929
I feel

38:18.000 --> 38:19.684
I should've known.

38:19.760 --> 38:22.081
- It's my duty to...
-No one knew.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.690
I didn't know. That's how he beat us.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.330
By being a friend.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.562
I spent years with that bastard.

38:31.280 --> 38:32.327
Looked up to him.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.004
I want to see him suffer.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.805
Don't mind the company,

38:40.920 --> 38:43.730
and I can always use
a man of your skills.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.530
Pick up the pieces
here at the Hub if you can.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.206
And only communicate
using one of these.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.284
You and I may be the highest-ranking
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents

38:53.360 --> 38:55.761
who aren't HYDRA or dead.

38:55.840 --> 38:57.649
Not that that means anything now.

38:58.560 --> 39:00.130
All we have is each other.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.929
So stay in touch, Agent Coulson.

39:04.520 --> 39:06.841
I guess you can call me Phil.

39:40.480 --> 39:41.811
It's all gone.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.808
In pieces, at least.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.001
Skye, try to restore some
of the firmware in the plane's systems.

39:56.120 --> 39:57.963
Fitz-Simmons, get a crew together,

39:58.080 --> 40:00.560
help May patch the holes.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.404
You still want me on board?

40:03.440 --> 40:04.566
You're not a friend.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.640
But I do believe you're an ally.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.568
We need all the allies we can get.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.488
What are we planning to do next?

40:12.560 --> 40:13.766
Survive.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.088
- Course is locked, ma'am.
-Good.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.927
He's not telling stories now, is he?

40:35.240 --> 40:38.244
You know what I'm thinking,
Agent Garrett?

40:38.320 --> 40:40.209
I'm thinking the Ice Box or the Fridge

40:40.280 --> 40:41.770
is a little too comfortable for you.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.531
Maybe we should put you
a little deeper underground.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.766
What do you think, Agent Ward?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.730
You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.450
Care to shoot the right one?

41:54.880 --> 41:58.566
Did I tell you about
this one time I was deep undercover?

41:58.640 --> 42:02.440
The Sicilian backup team,
a no-show of course.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.444
So I dropped in through
the skylight, used up my whole mag,

42:05.520 --> 42:09.206
and hit the final guy
in the chest with a flare gun.

42:09.280 --> 42:12.921
Boy, you should've seen
the look on that guy's face

42:13.000 --> 42:14.968
when that thing went off.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.560
Oh, man. He didn't know what hit him.
