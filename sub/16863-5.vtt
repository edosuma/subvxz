Previously on rescue me...

00:02.620 --> 00:04.600
- You got limp dick?
- No.

00:04.620 --> 00:05.740
Whose dick can't get hard?

00:05.760 --> 00:08.490
If I were you,I'd go to the doctor,get that checked out right away.

00:08.520 --> 00:10.540
- Put it here.
- I'd like you,

00:10.570 --> 00:14.330
this time,to get off your hindquarters and come over here

00:14.350 --> 00:14.950
and put it there.

00:14.970 --> 00:16.129
What if that doesn't appeal to me?

00:16.160 --> 00:17.330
I'm going to kick your ass.
How's that?

00:17.350 --> 00:19.150
Get the chair,janet.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.660

00:25.100 --> 00:27.490
Yes.He wants to be a firefighter.Let him.

00:27.510 --> 00:29.620
He's going to do it anyway.

00:29.650 --> 00:31.770
- What's that?
- Oh,it's a present from frenchie.

00:31.810 --> 00:32.659
9/11 footage?

00:32.689 --> 00:35.300
She wanted me to jot down my thoughts and feelings for the book.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.050
Tommy and me,we have this mutual respect thing going,all right?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.670
And I just want to respect the respect.

00:39.690 --> 00:42.340
Colleen and sean finding out about that?
I think you handled it like a champ.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.050
I think you're real lucky,too,about the whole,you know,

00:44.070 --> 00:46.130
- deciding not to have sex thing.
- What?

00:46.150 --> 00:48.410
I don't want her marrying this kid anymore than you do.

00:48.430 --> 00:48.960
Right.

00:48.990 --> 00:50.520
Yeah.And so,if they start having sex,

00:50.540 --> 00:52.300
then things are going to get messy and complicated,

00:52.330 --> 00:54.450
and they're going to forget this little marriage thing.

00:54.470 --> 00:56.370
- Yeah.
- Shit. Jimmy keefe.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.830
I just--uh,I was watching news footage from 9/11,

01:06.850 --> 01:07.690
and I saw him.

01:07.710 --> 01:11.670

01:45.390 --> 01:47.090
I don't hate your people. I wanted veal.

01:47.110 --> 01:48.690

02:53.380 --> 02:54.700
Yo,what the hell was that,man?

02:54.720 --> 02:56.760
It sounded like a goddamn atom bomb went off.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.310
Shit.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.790
- Where's mikey?

First reports are a terrorist attack,

03:05.590 --> 03:08.290
possible suitcase bomb,multiple locations.

03:08.310 --> 03:11.090

You were screaming.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.200
oh yeah...

04:34.230 --> 04:35.520
- Shit.
- You woke me up.

04:35.550 --> 04:37.050
I thought maybe one of the rats got you.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.610
I don't know.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.040
- God damn it.
- What the hell are you looking for?

04:40.060 --> 04:41.480
Goddamn shit!
My phone.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.260
Why don't you just ask me,for christ's sake?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.090
I told you,i know where everything is around here.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.660
See?

04:46.680 --> 04:47.440
Look.Here.Here.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.410
You really could clean up a little bit.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.790
You're making a mess.

04:50.810 --> 04:54.020
I had this nightmare.
Katy was being held hostage.

04:54.050 --> 04:56.050
By who,the gavin family?

04:56.620 --> 05:00.190
Suitcase bomb--bombs were going off.
There's a bunch of them.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.990
Looked like--looked like,well,here.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.280
- Oh,that's real funny.
- Yeah.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.090
- Hey,you want a muffin?
- You made muffins?

05:05.110 --> 05:07.680
No,I was thinking maybe go run down the corner and get some.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.840
Oh,shit.

05:16.870 --> 05:18.410
Oh,son of a bitch.

05:18.430 --> 05:19.830
Unh!

05:20.740 --> 05:22.200
Now you're never going to find it.

05:22.220 --> 05:25.300
6,10 times I've called her in the last 3 days,you know?

05:25.330 --> 05:26.560
And each time,I leave--

05:26.590 --> 05:28.350
I say i want to find out what the story is with katy.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.200
Where is she going to school?
Blah blah blah.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.740
And she doesn't call me back.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.450
You know what I think?

05:34.090 --> 05:36.230
- Katy hates me?
- No.Janet hates you.

05:36.250 --> 05:38.060
Katy's what?
She's 12.She's just--

05:38.080 --> 05:39.710
she's just learning how to hate her mother.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.500
- You know what I'm going to do?
- Oh,I know what you're going to do.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.160
You're going to drive over there,you're going to spy on them,

05:43.180 --> 05:45.440
and if no one's home,you're going to break into the house,

05:45.460 --> 05:48.030
you're going to fish around,see if you can find a

05:48.050 --> 05:51.930
piece of mail maybe with some info or the address of the school katy's going to on it.

05:51.940 --> 05:54.820
You're going to drive down there.
You're going to stake out the school.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.430
You're going to wait until either katy comes out or janet shows up,whichever comes first.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.090
What can I say?
I know you.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.190
All right.
I got to go.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.440
Fine.
Well,I guess I'll get the muffins,then.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.850
Yeah,yeah.
Thanks,pal.

06:07.870 --> 06:08.880
All right.
Tell them I said "hey."

06:08.910 --> 06:10.440
All right.
See you later.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.410
People think the kennedys are dysfunctional.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.640
Ohh.

06:19.110 --> 06:20.780
Ohh.

07:51.090 --> 07:52.890
So,let me get this straight.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.620
Now you want me to be a firefighter?

07:55.420 --> 07:57.350
Ok.
This is some kind of test,right?

07:57.370 --> 08:00.620
Uh,no.
Silly,you are my son,and I love you.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.870
And I want what's best for you.

08:03.890 --> 08:06.570
Honey,i want you to be happy.

08:06.590 --> 08:08.660
- Since when?
- Since always.

08:08.670 --> 08:10.720
- Bullshit.
- You bullshit.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.600
And don't talk to me that way.
I'm your mother.

08:12.610 --> 08:15.170
I know,which is why none of this makes any sense.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.270
Listen to me.

08:16.290 --> 08:19.480
This is the new me,ok?

08:19.510 --> 08:22.440
I took the old me,and I crumpled her up in a teeny little ball,

08:22.470 --> 08:23.650
and i chucked her in the trash,ok?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.630
And the new me knows that you need to be happy.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.140
What's with the face?

08:32.159 --> 08:33.539
Mom...

08:33.559 --> 08:35.590
I hate to say this to the new you,

08:35.610 --> 08:38.909
but here goes.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.880
Is the new you on drugs?

08:40.900 --> 08:43.299
Uh,yeah,I guess.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.250
I've been on those drugs for a very long time,

08:46.280 --> 08:47.960
but my doctor has changed them up,

08:47.990 --> 08:50.390
and I'm on this new combo

08:50.410 --> 08:54.250
that keeps me way more balanced and upbeat

08:54.270 --> 09:00.630
and able to deal with the idea of you doing this very difficult and dangerous job.

09:00.650 --> 09:03.870
Ok,great.So,did you call uncle tommy and ask him if he could help me out?

09:03.890 --> 09:05.330
I'm high.
I'm not that high.

09:05.350 --> 09:07.010
- I called mike.
- Mike the probie?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.460
But he's an idiot.

09:09.470 --> 09:11.070
Plus,he's gay.

09:11.090 --> 09:12.320
Not anymore.

09:12.350 --> 09:14.160
- Gay or stupid?
- Both.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.060
Oh,so is he on drugs,too,

09:16.080 --> 09:18.560
you know,new kinds of drugs that make you want to read books

09:18.590 --> 09:20.230
and not blow other dudes anymore?

09:20.240 --> 09:25.420
You know what,damien?I am not going to have you training under uncle tommy,ok?

09:25.440 --> 09:29.010
And you know what?I have gone out of my way

09:29.030 --> 09:33.380
to force myself into accepting this stupid goddamn idea of yours.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.860
And you want to know something else?You could have graduated

09:35.890 --> 09:39.330
from goddamn nyu,and I spent $80,000

09:39.350 --> 09:41.300
over there just so that you could figure out

09:41.320 --> 09:44.460
that you want to do the same goddamn thing as your father.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.540
So you know what?
Why don't you cut me a little slack,ok?

09:47.560 --> 09:50.570
How about that?Cut me a little slack for once

09:50.590 --> 09:52.760
in your privileged little life

09:52.790 --> 09:57.790
and do one goddamn thing that I ask you to,huh?

10:08.080 --> 10:11.000
Guess there's a little bit of the old me stuck in there.

10:12.290 --> 10:15.030
Maybe the new you should up her dosage.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.280
I know.

10:25.310 --> 10:27.760
I told you,get off my ass about it.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.630
That's enough.
Stop asking me!

10:30.650 --> 10:32.350
Hello?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.840
Janet?

10:35.860 --> 10:37.740
Janet left.

10:42.670 --> 10:45.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.460
Talking to somebody in here?

10:50.340 --> 10:53.640
- Um,uh,me and carly.
- Oh.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.180
Gets on my nuts.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.270
So,where is janet?

10:59.020 --> 11:02.030
Uh,she took the little guy swimming.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.690
You can see her car's gone.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.550
Yeah.
Yeah.Um...

11:06.240 --> 11:07.360
she just left you here?

11:07.380 --> 11:09.430
Tommy,news flash--I live here now.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.410
See my ramp?

11:10.430 --> 11:13.890
Yeah.I just thought--i thought maybe she had some furniture delivered or something.

11:13.910 --> 11:15.040
Calling me furniture?

11:15.060 --> 11:17.310
No.No,no,no.I just didn't know what--I would--

11:17.330 --> 11:19.000
no.I would never say that.I would--

11:19.030 --> 11:20.270
You said it.

11:20.290 --> 11:22.520
That's not what I meant,though.
I would never call you a,you know--

11:22.550 --> 11:24.810
- What,a gimp?
- No.

11:24.810 --> 11:28.110
I would say cripple.
Is cripple cool?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.310
- No.
- Paralyze?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.600
Yeah,well,paralyzed is accurate,but it isn't cool.

11:31.620 --> 11:35.000
Ok.Then I won't--I won't-- what should I say?

11:35.020 --> 11:37.530
I'm busting your balls.
Come on.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.920
Look,I owe you an apology 'cause I was out of line.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.940
This is your turf,it's your family.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.810
I respect that.I just--you know,

11:44.820 --> 11:46.870
just the alpha male thing coming out now.
You know?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.400
Cool.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.710
Why don't you let me take you and buy you a drink?

11:50.740 --> 11:52.560
I'll take a rain check on that.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.660
I'll tell you,one of the reasons I came over--

11:55.690 --> 11:59.710
I can't get any information from janet about katy.

11:59.730 --> 12:00.860
I'm her father.
You know?

12:00.900 --> 12:02.410
I deserve to know what the deal is.

12:02.420 --> 12:03.930
I'm not going to jump in the middle of this,tom.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.410
This is between you and janet.

12:05.430 --> 12:06.830
She's not here.
She'll be back in a couple of hours.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.340
In the meantime,let me tell you,buy you a drink,all right?

12:09.360 --> 12:11.820
Have a little mano a mano.

12:11.870 --> 12:13.870
Well,I don't drink.

12:15.020 --> 12:17.970
Hey,no,I really can't drink.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.550
Well,all right.
Be careful.

12:23.380 --> 12:25.220
- Hello,sean.
- Hey,doc.How you doing?

12:25.240 --> 12:27.480
Listen,I'm feeling so much better in my back,really.

12:27.510 --> 12:29.320
It's like no stiffness,no pain.

12:29.350 --> 12:31.480
- It's like magic,honestly.
- Sean.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.210
Uh,I'm still a little apprehensive about the whole cock situation.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.390
- Sean,please--
- Hey,maybe tonight's the night,you know?

12:36.410 --> 12:38.760
Go home,put on some music,light the candles,maybe take a bubble bath,

12:38.780 --> 12:43.730
break out the jergens,and give 'er the ol' college try.

12:44.620 --> 12:49.760
Sean,something turned up on your mri,so we ran a few blood tests.

12:49.780 --> 12:52.210
I'm sorry--blood tests for my back?

12:52.230 --> 12:55.090
We found a tumor on your kidney.

12:55.110 --> 12:58.160
I'm fairly certain it's renal cancer,sean.

12:58.170 --> 13:00.240
It's extremely rare for a man your age.

13:00.260 --> 13:03.050
We're going to do a biopsy,but in most cases,

13:03.080 --> 13:07.480
a tumor of this mass turns out to be malignant.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.230
But hey,look on the bright side.

13:09.250 --> 13:12.570
Your penis is going to grow at least an inch or two in length.

13:12.590 --> 13:15.280
This means you're probably going to have a very difficult time finding a girlfriend

13:15.310 --> 13:18.400
who can handle such a unique specimen of manhood.

13:18.430 --> 13:23.100
But that's what we in the medical profession call a good problem.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.810
Sean?

13:26.830 --> 13:28.670
Did you hear me?

13:28.700 --> 13:31.680
I'm sorry.Did you just say something about my penis?

13:32.180 --> 13:33.980
No,sean.

13:34.490 --> 13:36.910
You've got cancer.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.930
Damn.

13:48.600 --> 13:51.440
Get yourself a goddamn bicycle,asshole!

13:53.300 --> 13:55.990
I used to drive a little short track indy,you know,when I had stems.

13:56.010 --> 13:56.490
Yeah.

13:56.500 --> 13:59.430
I got a guy working on a cart for me right now.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.060
- That reminds me.
- Yeah?

14:07.090 --> 14:09.200
- Hand me a beer,will you?
- Huh?

14:09.220 --> 14:11.140
Cold one from the back in a cooler.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.400
Y-you want a beer?

14:14.420 --> 14:17.630
Yeah.
Yeah.I'd like a cerveza.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.880
Ok.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.770
Andale,andale.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.720
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

14:28.740 --> 14:31.890
- You told me to grab you a beer.
- Did I ask you to crack it?

14:31.910 --> 14:34.330
Well,I just thought you wanted-- I'll crack my own goddamn beer.

14:34.350 --> 14:35.580
- What,do you think I'm a cripple or something?
- No.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.920
- Grab this.
- What?

14:36.940 --> 14:38.680
- What--
- Treat me like a victim.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.290
We're going awful fast.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.640
- You got it?
- I got it.Yeah.

14:48.960 --> 14:53.680
See,my--my legs don't work,but my arms work,my hands work,my brain works.

14:53.710 --> 14:56.200
My cock works,'cause I'm sure you're wondering that.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.500
I wasn't wonder--wondering about that.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.510
- All the exes wonder about it.
- Not me.

15:01.530 --> 15:03.330
At least,if they got any balls.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.630
I like to get that shit right out on the table.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.030
Get a goddamn chair,grandpa.

15:14.050 --> 15:16.610
Give me a beer,will you?

15:16.630 --> 15:18.140
You want another one?

15:18.170 --> 15:20.490
- Do I have one in my hand?
- Ok.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.870
So here's how it works.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.540
I still get hard.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.810
I mean,a lot.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.810
But it's all random times,you know?So

15:28.840 --> 15:31.150
I got to constantly be checking to see if I got wood.

15:33.090 --> 15:34.880
Which means that janet and I,

15:34.910 --> 15:37.140
we never plan on when we're having sex.

15:37.150 --> 15:40.090
If it happens,when it happens,it happens.So

15:40.120 --> 15:44.870
if we're at the supermarket,we're in the park or the car,you know,

15:44.890 --> 15:46.410
it's go time,baby.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.770
You know,and chicks love spontaneity.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.310
And my junk,it lasts for an eternity.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.240
I had janet on my pole

15:56.260 --> 15:59.860
for,like,45 minutes to an hour just riding and riding and riding.

15:59.870 --> 16:02.550
She has 4 or 5 orgasms.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.770
What's the longest you ever lasted with janet?

16:05.490 --> 16:07.040
I don't really keep track of stuff like--

16:07.070 --> 16:09.570
Oh,come on,come on,none of that bullshit.
No boundaries,baby.

16:09.590 --> 16:12.120
It's not a boundary thing,ok?
I just never kept track of that.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.590
- Tell me how long.
- 12 minutes.

16:13.610 --> 16:15.240
12 minutes?

16:15.260 --> 16:17.310
That's not bad,for a walker.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.300
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

16:21.860 --> 16:25.540
Garrity.
Hey.Sean.

16:26.340 --> 16:28.050
- Pat!
- What's up,bro?

16:28.080 --> 16:28.910
Oh,man.
Hey!

16:28.930 --> 16:31.760
Shit,I don't think I've seen you since probie school.
You looking good.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.160
I'm ok,yeah.
How's things?

16:33.180 --> 16:36.380
Oh,you know,it'S...
it's been better.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.710
Oh,shit.

16:39.730 --> 16:43.180
It's ok,buddy.
Hey,it's ok,buddy.You're ok.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.780
Oh,shit.

16:45.790 --> 16:48.860
You're going to be ok.

16:53.070 --> 16:56.410
Dewars,3 fingers,same as always.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.600
Francis.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.790
Anything for your girlfriend?

17:00.300 --> 17:02.090
He don't drink.

17:02.100 --> 17:05.180
- So what's he doing here?
- I don't know.What are you doing here?

17:06.410 --> 17:07.770
I'm not sure.

17:07.790 --> 17:11.670
Everybody in my place drinks.
Don't think you're special.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.770
I'll take a jameson,neat.

17:14.790 --> 17:17.140
So predictable.

17:17.150 --> 17:19.540
Well,well,look who came out to play.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.550
I knew that sobriety shit was a front.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.910
It's not.

17:22.930 --> 17:27.030
Um,sometimes i order a drink,and then I don't drink it.

17:27.050 --> 17:30.810
It's a thing,a system I have.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.840
My sponsor thought of it,actually.

17:33.860 --> 17:37.260
Who's your sponsor,satan?

17:38.770 --> 17:41.510
Satan would be a godsend.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.970
So how do you keep them down,tommy?

17:43.990 --> 17:47.010
- I'm sorry?
- The ghosts.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.950
Janet told me about them.

17:49.970 --> 17:52.590
Janet told me just about everything.

17:52.610 --> 17:54.540
Ok.First of all,

17:54.570 --> 17:56.040
janet doesn't know everything.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.180
- Janet--
- Everybody has ghosts,tommy.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.390
You're not the only one.

17:59.410 --> 18:02.630
Who do you think I was talking to when you came over to the house?

18:03.970 --> 18:05.820
I got 'em.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.750
I-- I had 'em.
Now,I got...

18:08.770 --> 18:10.090
this.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.130
And these.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.870
I don't drink in front of janet and the kids.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.950
They don't know anything about any of this.

18:17.970 --> 18:20.980
I get too loaded,I take 2 of these.

18:21.830 --> 18:25.420
And to crank up the sleep,I take a few of these,you know?

18:25.450 --> 18:27.710
It's a perfect system.
Yeah.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.860
That's what they said about communism.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.900
Stalin didn't have uppers and downers.
He just had vodka.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.650
For the most part,uh...

18:43.320 --> 18:45.870
they used to come out when I drank.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.510
You miss 'em?

18:50.410 --> 18:53.060
Yeah,sometimes.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.500
I'd love to have your problem.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.690
8 years ago,I--I...

19:01.720 --> 19:05.040
was playing hockey late,and...

19:07.140 --> 19:11.620
I was driving home with my brother and my cousin.

19:12.330 --> 19:14.490
The 3 of us were as sober as judges,

19:14.510 --> 19:16.640
and we were laughing our balls off.

19:16.650 --> 19:21.530
This guy,I cleaned his clock,and he swallowed his tooth.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.880
And,uh...bam!

19:24.890 --> 19:30.440
Out of nowhere comes this prick in a piss-yellow hummer.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.870
Broadsides us.

19:34.520 --> 19:38.640
Turned the lights out on my brother,my cousin...

19:39.180 --> 19:44.930
and the lower half of me,except my cock,of course,but you know,

19:44.950 --> 19:48.040
we've covered that in detail.

19:49.770 --> 19:52.330
So...

19:52.990 --> 19:56.170
I've been hell on wheels ever since.

19:59.140 --> 20:03.410
No more deceit!No more lies!

20:04.050 --> 20:05.620
Look,that's my point exactly,all right?

20:05.640 --> 20:08.730
All great truths begin as blasphemies,ok?

20:08.750 --> 20:10.710
I mean,just take a look at our history books,for example--

20:10.730 --> 20:14.070
at least the ones that aren't completely falsified or embellished.

20:14.090 --> 20:16.110
Look,don't--don't get me wrong,ok?

20:16.120 --> 20:18.130
I'm just a guy with questions,that's all.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.990
And even if my beliefs don't make me the most popular guy in the firehouse,

20:21.000 --> 20:22.960
the guys all say I'm full of shit,you know what?

20:22.970 --> 20:26.090
At the end of the day,last time I checked,this was still america.

20:26.110 --> 20:28.170
- Totally.
- Right.

20:28.650 --> 20:31.250
So,you're a firefighter?

20:31.270 --> 20:34.710
Yeah.Yeah.
I'm franco rivera,62 truck uptown.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.600
Can we take a picture with you?

20:36.620 --> 20:39.060
Yeah,sure.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.920
No more lies!
No more...

20:44.060 --> 20:45.880
Listen,tom...

20:46.750 --> 20:49.180
your daughter katy.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.900
The reason you haven't been seeing her around lately--

20:52.920 --> 20:55.000
she's in boarding school.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.080
Did you say boarding school?

20:57.100 --> 20:59.400
Yeah.
Connecticut.

20:59.410 --> 21:01.600
Been a couple of weeks now.She's--

21:01.620 --> 21:03.090
it's a real nice place.

21:03.110 --> 21:05.900
That lying bitch.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.870
- Here's what we're going to do--
- hey,listen.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.040
Nice and easy.

21:16.340 --> 21:19.110
Janet was going to tell you herself,but I insisted,

21:19.130 --> 21:22.050
'cause you and me,we're kind of the same from the waist up.

21:22.070 --> 21:23.750
I know how you're going to react when you get the news,

21:23.780 --> 21:26.560
the same way I knew you were going to come barreling into our house back there.

21:26.590 --> 21:27.820
Our house?

21:27.840 --> 21:30.550
You mean,the house that I'm paying the rent on,that house?

21:30.580 --> 21:31.900
Is that what you're talking about?

21:31.930 --> 21:34.650
I hear janet gets any shit from you over this,

21:34.670 --> 21:36.400
I will kick your skinny ass.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.230
You're going to kick my ass?
That's funny.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.500
You doubt I could?

21:42.500 --> 21:47.410
Listen.Before that drunk son of a bitch took my

21:47.430 --> 21:49.180
brother

21:49.200 --> 21:50.970
and my cousin

21:51.000 --> 21:52.480
and my legs,

21:52.500 --> 21:55.150
I base jumped into a 600-foot crevice in brazil.

21:55.170 --> 21:57.460
I surfed the big waves on the north shore of hawaii.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.670
I climbed goddamned kilimanjaro.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.950
You think you're an obstacle I can't overcome?

22:01.970 --> 22:03.320
Think again,skippy.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.730
But hey.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.450
There's no reason we can't be friends.

22:08.470 --> 22:10.740
Oh,I got to change my piss bag.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.180
- You going to drink that?
- No.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.210
That's really good.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.930
Shit.

23:10.090 --> 23:12.230
Hi.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.480
Hi.

23:13.510 --> 23:16.660
Oh,you are genevieve.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.070
I am.

23:18.100 --> 23:19.850
Hi,sheila.

23:19.870 --> 23:21.930
Yes.
Right.Yes.That's me.

23:21.950 --> 23:23.870
I'm tom—

23:23.900 --> 23:25.480
I'm damien's mom.

23:25.510 --> 23:26.970
I know.
I heard.

23:26.980 --> 23:28.940
So...

23:28.970 --> 23:30.500
how's the book going?

23:30.510 --> 23:32.670
Oh,very well.

23:32.690 --> 23:34.690
I would like to interview you.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.070
Oh.

23:36.670 --> 23:40.660
Um,lou gave me this,and tommy saw it,

23:40.680 --> 23:44.900
and it's some old news footage of that day.

23:44.920 --> 23:45.710
Yeah?

23:45.740 --> 23:47.440
It has your husband on it,

23:47.460 --> 23:52.200
and it shows that apparently he didn't die in the collapse of the first tower.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.730
Really?

23:55.430 --> 23:58.490
- Would you like to see it?
- I don't know.

23:58.510 --> 24:02.310
I don't--I--

24:02.340 --> 24:03.660
where is that from?

24:04.770 --> 24:09.790
The bbc gave me a lot of old footage.
There was just so much of it.

24:09.820 --> 24:13.000
I thought you might want to see it.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.220
And they're sure that it's him?

24:15.240 --> 24:18.620
Yeah.Lou and tommy recognized him,and

24:18.650 --> 24:21.100
you see his face...

24:26.920 --> 24:30.170
I'll leave it here.

24:43.510 --> 24:45.650
You know,I've been on the job 10 years,

24:45.670 --> 24:48.660
running into burning buildings with floors collapsing and

24:48.690 --> 24:51.650
ceilings dropping on my head,breathing the most

24:51.670 --> 24:58.600
toxic,disgusting,horrible,acrid smoke there is.
Chemicals,asbestos,ash.

24:58.620 --> 25:01.170
I mean,the heat alone is--

25:01.210 --> 25:05.510
not to mention the 4 weeks I volunteered down at ground zero cleaning up.

25:05.530 --> 25:08.040
Plus a pack and a half a day habit 'cause of the stress of this bullshit,

25:08.060 --> 25:12.300
and have I ever once,in 10 years,been hurt?Injured?Broken bones?No.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.440
Asthma,emphysema?

25:14.460 --> 25:17.320
None of that.
What do I got?I got...

25:17.340 --> 25:22.160
a goddamn tumor on my kidney.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.490
It's ridiculous.

25:24.510 --> 25:26.550
And ironic.
What?

25:27.240 --> 25:30.000
What you just said is practically the definition of ironic.

25:30.020 --> 25:32.880
Not to split hairs or nothin'.
I'm just saying.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.160
What happens now?

25:34.180 --> 25:35.190
- What now?
- Yeah.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.320
Is you keep this shit to yourself.

25:37.330 --> 25:39.460
I can't keep it to myself.
I mean,I got to tell the bosses.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.960
It's obvious it's ground zero related.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.430
Of course it's from ground zero.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.740
32-year-old men don't get kidney cancer,ok?

25:46.760 --> 25:49.840
I mean,mine's in the lungs,so it's obvious where it came from.

25:49.860 --> 25:52.980
You know,I got no choice but to retire.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.480
It's part of the job i never anticipated,but

25:55.500 --> 25:58.000
if I had to do it all over again,

25:58.020 --> 26:00.680
I'd be right back down there digging our brothers out.

26:00.690 --> 26:02.600
Only,maybe,

26:02.620 --> 26:04.670
I'd be wearing a mask this time.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.590
Yeah,you and me both.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.440
So,what do I do?
How do i even...

26:18.470 --> 26:20.080
You take some leave.

26:20.110 --> 26:23.610
Scrounge up whatever cash you can get your hands on.
You get that kidney cut out,

26:23.640 --> 26:25.340
pray it hasn't spread.

26:26.900 --> 26:29.030
You try and use your insurance,

26:29.060 --> 26:31.350
you're as good as off the job.

26:31.380 --> 26:33.710
So,let me get this straight.

26:33.740 --> 26:37.900
I can't use the fdny insurance that I get for the treatment of the cancer

26:37.920 --> 26:40.750
that I got volunteering and risking my goddamn life

26:40.770 --> 26:44.230
cleaning up at ground zero after the greatest tragedy in the history of the fdny--

26:44.260 --> 26:44.980
that's what you're telling me--

26:45.000 --> 26:47.540
without ending up stuck behind a desk or kicked off the job?

26:47.560 --> 26:48.890
Yeah.

26:48.910 --> 26:51.100
That's ironic.

26:51.130 --> 26:53.460
You're goddamn right.

27:04.270 --> 27:07.600
- Ok.
- Yeah.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.050
Thanks for the boat ride.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.380
It's very romantic.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.030
You know how I do.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.070
I does it big,ma.

27:16.780 --> 27:20.190
I guess we should head home so I can bang my head against the sink,

27:20.210 --> 27:23.630
take a cold shower,and slip into my chastity belt.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.640
I'm sure you can find a better way to ease your suffering.

27:26.660 --> 27:30.070
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
We said we were going to wait.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.280
Baby,I'm sorry.

27:41.340 --> 27:46.840
But you know,you see,this right here doesn't really help much.

27:46.860 --> 27:50.290
You know,I could do something else for you.

27:50.310 --> 27:51.470
What are you talking about?

27:51.490 --> 27:54.730
- Like,a handjob.
- Oh!No,no,no.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.840
Believe me,I would love a handjob right now,but--

27:58.860 --> 28:01.470
That's just going to open up the floodgates,right?

28:01.470 --> 28:04.050
And all the commitment and everything that we worked so hard for

28:04.070 --> 28:07.530
is just going to fly right out of the window into the river.So,

28:07.550 --> 28:08.800
no.

28:08.810 --> 28:12.040
Have you ever considered that maybe we're not giving ourselves enough credit here?

28:12.060 --> 28:15.820
I mean,you love me,don't you?

28:15.840 --> 28:17.730
Of course I love you.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.050
And I love you back,so

28:20.070 --> 28:23.430
what could be so bad about that?

28:32.710 --> 28:36.290
Guess a handjob wouldn't hurt.

28:44.300 --> 28:47.170
Hi,honey.

28:47.180 --> 28:50.090
Jesus,tommy.
You scared me.

28:50.110 --> 28:52.040
What did you do to him?

28:52.050 --> 28:55.200
Oh,he actually--he did this to himself.

28:55.930 --> 28:58.220
Where do you get your balls big enough

28:58.240 --> 29:03.070
to send our daughter to a private boarding school upstate

29:03.100 --> 29:05.840
without even consulting with me?

29:05.860 --> 29:07.140
Hmm?

29:07.160 --> 29:08.570
Dwight?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.940
He's very,very drunk.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.370
And on pills.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.580
Yeah.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.140
Yeah.

29:18.160 --> 29:22.330
That's right.Mr. Put everything on the table

29:22.360 --> 29:24.680
is a goddamn lush.

29:25.870 --> 29:30.410
Oh,yeah.And he sees ghosts,which I think is kind of ironic.

29:30.430 --> 29:32.640
What are you talking about?

29:32.650 --> 29:36.620
You can question a lot of things about me.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.740
My convictions...

29:47.430 --> 29:49.970
my faithfulness.

29:52.130 --> 29:54.130
My drinking.

29:55.190 --> 29:57.510
And the fact that I switched his uppers with his downers,

29:57.540 --> 30:01.170
which is why he's currently in the condition that he's in.

30:01.190 --> 30:04.540
But one thing you can't question about me,ever...

30:05.030 --> 30:08.580
is my love for my kids.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.110
Or my determination to see

30:13.140 --> 30:15.190
to their happiness.

30:15.730 --> 30:20.030
So,you and I are going to drive

30:20.060 --> 30:20.860
to katy's school.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.350
We're going to sit down with her

30:22.370 --> 30:26.490
and let her decide if she wants to stay there or come home

30:26.520 --> 30:31.450
and,once she comes home,whether she wants to live with you or with me.

30:31.470 --> 30:34.630
But one thing's for certain.

30:34.650 --> 30:36.970
She's not living under the same roof

30:36.990 --> 30:40.610
as this junkie asshole.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.180
You ok?

30:47.210 --> 30:51.080
Oh,yeah.
Yeah.I'm--I'm good.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.340
Hell yeah.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.450
You're freaked out.

30:53.470 --> 30:55.520
No.

30:55.530 --> 30:57.590
I'm good.

30:57.610 --> 31:00.330
I know we said we weren't going to go all the way,but

31:00.350 --> 31:02.140
I'm glad we did.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.960
- You're a very good lover.
- Thank you.

31:07.860 --> 31:11.300
Uh-- look.It's just,

31:11.330 --> 31:13.320
you're only 19.

31:13.340 --> 31:14.580
So?

31:14.600 --> 31:17.560
So,like,where'd you learn how to do all that stuff?

31:17.580 --> 31:20.980
Old boyfriends,my mother.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.790
So,um—

31:24.820 --> 31:29.570
What about the ice and peanut butter ass play thing?

31:29.590 --> 31:31.240
Where'd that come from?

31:31.270 --> 31:32.890
That was chuck.

31:32.900 --> 31:34.090
Tattoo artists.

31:34.110 --> 31:36.380
They always want you to go around the back door.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.400
Right.

31:39.220 --> 31:42.270
And the biting thing.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.430
Where did that come from?

31:43.460 --> 31:45.850
Oh,that was my mother.

31:45.870 --> 31:49.690
Wow.
Mom's a full-on freak.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.990
Round 3?

32:44.240 --> 32:45.580
Hey.

32:47.410 --> 32:49.070
Hey.

32:54.380 --> 32:57.180
What,are you not talking to me?

32:59.890 --> 33:01.600
What?

33:10.510 --> 33:13.170
Why didn't you tell me about the video?

33:13.190 --> 33:15.240
What video?

33:15.270 --> 33:17.710
Of jimmy.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.500
I didn't know what video you were talking about--

33:20.530 --> 33:21.880
Answer me.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.500
I thought it would upset you.

33:24.530 --> 33:27.710
Ok--

33:27.730 --> 33:31.300
ok.I--it was a shock to me,ok?

33:31.320 --> 33:35.350
I watched it a few times over and over again.I couldn't believe--

33:35.370 --> 33:37.520
you know,he wasn't where we thought he was.

33:37.540 --> 33:41.060
And he was--you know,he was in the second tower.

33:41.090 --> 33:42.980
It was just-- it threw a monkey wrench into--

33:43.010 --> 33:44.950
it upset me,you know?It upset me.

33:44.970 --> 33:47.620
I thought it was kind of-- just--what?

33:47.640 --> 33:49.940
You weren't thinking about how I would feel.

33:49.960 --> 33:50.970
What did I just say?That's what--

33:51.000 --> 33:54.980
You were only concerned with how you would feel.

33:56.360 --> 33:58.730
Ok.
Can I talk to you over here?

34:04.890 --> 34:06.700
- Ok.I--
- You idiot.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.929
I want to know every goddamn detail.

34:09.949 --> 34:14.300
I want to know when,how,and where jimmy shows up.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.650
I don't bang your brains out for 2 year--

34:18.670 --> 34:22.340
So that you could get your rocks off.

34:22.370 --> 34:26.570
I did it because I thought that somehow,

34:26.590 --> 34:29.520
somewhere,very deep inside of you,

34:29.530 --> 34:31.989
you'd open up and let me in.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.449
I know,crazy,right?

34:33.469 --> 34:35.719
The great tommy gavin!
He's a closed shop!

34:35.739 --> 34:39.170
Nobody gets in!
You don't even give a shit about your godson.

34:39.190 --> 34:40.340
I--what are you talking--

34:40.370 --> 34:41.199
Guess what?

34:41.219 --> 34:43.500
Mikey's going to lead him through the academy.

34:43.520 --> 34:46.139
Yeah.That's why I dropped him off.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.909
And then,damien's going to become the kind of firefighter

34:48.929 --> 34:50.969
- that his father always wished he would be.
- Really?

34:50.989 --> 34:52.940
And no thanks to you.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.840
Ok.'Cause if we want to talk about selfish and resentful--ok,

34:56.860 --> 34:57.860
just think about it.

34:57.880 --> 35:01.950
You're putting your only son's safety in the hands of mike?

35:01.980 --> 35:03.590
Of—

35:03.620 --> 35:09.120
Mike?Mike's--mike's an idiot.
Mike's a moron,ok?

35:09.150 --> 35:11.070
He may be a moron.

35:11.090 --> 35:15.280
But he's also one very big thing that you are not.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.540
Retarded?

35:18.170 --> 35:21.050
Trustworthy.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.810
Shit.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.240
What,are you on drugs?

35:26.260 --> 35:28.840
Shitloads.

35:33.150 --> 35:39.060
My husband was a firefighter when we met in high school--

35:39.080 --> 35:41.630
in his mind.

35:41.650 --> 35:44.470
His uncle mike,tommy's dad,

35:44.490 --> 35:47.800
had been a firefighter.His uncle teddy--

35:47.830 --> 35:49.940
he and tommy,

35:49.970 --> 35:54.170
that's the only thing they ever thought of being.

35:54.190 --> 35:59.350
So,when I saw that new footage of jimmy...

36:00.630 --> 36:02.510
it made me happy.

36:02.540 --> 36:05.000
I can't explain it,but

36:05.020 --> 36:07.900
I knew that he didn't--

36:07.930 --> 36:10.690
that he wasn't in the first building.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.840
But all the reports were saying that--

36:12.860 --> 36:14.820
Do you know that feeling that you get when you just,like,

36:14.850 --> 36:18.010
ever so barely escape a car crash?

36:18.030 --> 36:20.650
You know,someone suddenly stops short or

36:20.680 --> 36:22.410
races in front of you at an intersection,

36:22.430 --> 36:23.910
and you think to yourself for a second,like,

36:23.930 --> 36:26.860
right as you slam the brakes--like,"oh,oh!"

36:26.880 --> 36:29.550
Ok.This might be it."

36:29.570 --> 36:30.480
You know?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.930
And all the air skips out of your lungs,

36:32.960 --> 36:37.450
and your heart feels like it's going to explode with fright,and

36:37.480 --> 36:42.710
your skin sits up real tight on your bones,and there's this

36:42.720 --> 36:47.650
huge rush of breath and blood and...

36:48.340 --> 36:53.060
that shiver just shot,like,

36:53.080 --> 36:55.630
right through me,

36:55.650 --> 37:00.180
but not when the first building fell.

37:00.190 --> 37:03.470
It was during the second.

37:03.490 --> 37:09.100
I knew that jimmy was gone during the second collapse.

37:09.110 --> 37:10.850
I stopped breathing.

37:10.870 --> 37:13.560
My eyes-- I couldn't blink.

37:13.570 --> 37:19.110
My hands froze up like claws.

37:19.130 --> 37:22.580
And I thought to myself,

37:22.600 --> 37:26.260
"oh,we're never going to finish the kitchen."

37:26.270 --> 37:30.260
You know,'cause we were working on the kitchen,

37:30.280 --> 37:34.810
putting in new counters and cabinets and stuff.

37:34.830 --> 37:42.930
And as those first floors began to tumble down,

37:42.950 --> 37:47.700
I mean,like,i don't know however long it took,

37:47.720 --> 37:50.870
like,11 seconds...

37:50.890 --> 37:54.490
my whole life...

37:54.510 --> 37:57.230
my love,

37:57.250 --> 38:01.010
the way I wake up in the morning

38:01.030 --> 38:03.090
every day,the way I go to sleep

38:03.120 --> 38:08.310
every night,all of that just changed

38:08.340 --> 38:10.970
forever.

38:12.680 --> 38:16.630
Floor by floor,

38:16.650 --> 38:20.530
I just...

38:20.570 --> 38:22.570
disappeared.

38:32.750 --> 38:37.440
When you lose that one person that you...

38:37.460 --> 38:41.490
you know,were meant to be with for the rest of your life

38:41.510 --> 38:46.520
so unexpectedly and so soon...

38:46.550 --> 38:50.240
I don't--

38:50.270 --> 38:54.720
it's like,you know,who can walk into your...

38:59.310 --> 39:02.450
real love?

39:02.470 --> 39:05.980
Is just gone.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.740
Talk.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.760
Touch.

39:10.780 --> 39:12.820
Sex.

39:12.830 --> 39:15.830
And breakfast.

39:16.700 --> 39:19.760
It's funny,you know.I totally thought that I was going to just

39:19.780 --> 39:22.100
go fetal and curl up in a ball

39:22.120 --> 39:24.920
and cry and...

39:24.940 --> 39:27.520
but I didn'T.

39:27.540 --> 39:30.430
I made arrangements.

39:30.450 --> 39:34.390
I carried my husband's helmet to the funeral.

39:34.410 --> 39:37.300
I listened to the mayor and

39:37.310 --> 39:41.510
the chief and tommy talk about my husband.

39:41.530 --> 39:44.800
I buried him.

39:44.820 --> 39:48.140
I held my son

39:48.160 --> 39:51.370
as he cried against my shoulder,

39:51.400 --> 40:01.320
and i tucked him in that way every night for months.

40:02.590 --> 40:05.380
And then...

40:05.400 --> 40:08.110
I went fetal...

40:08.130 --> 40:12.240
for 5 years.

40:12.260 --> 40:14.720
Among many other things,

40:14.740 --> 40:18.480
i completely zeroed in on tommy

40:18.500 --> 40:21.980
because he was the closest thing that I could find

40:22.000 --> 40:27.620
on this entire earth to replace jimmy.

40:27.640 --> 40:31.810
I cursed tommy.
I slept with tommy.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.730
I blamed tommy.
I made tommy breakfast.

40:34.750 --> 40:38.340
Tommy finished my kitchen.

40:43.760 --> 40:49.780
I know that tommy is haunted by jimmy's death,

40:49.810 --> 40:52.470
literally.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.010
I--I--

40:55.030 --> 40:58.320
I think that sometimes tommy...

40:58.340 --> 41:02.050
wishes that jimmy had lived,

41:02.070 --> 41:07.340
and that he had died in jimmy's place.

41:14.970 --> 41:16.520
And so do I.

41:16.530 --> 41:17.750
