00:25.123 --> 00:27.903
"Never underestimate
the power of a dream."

00:28.069 --> 00:29.446
Excuse me?

00:29.612 --> 00:31.615
The narrator.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.034
Yeah. He's dreaming.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.662
Very challenging book.
I love Calvino.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.101
I was going to get on Kindle,

00:39.168 --> 00:41.249
but then people couldn't
see how deep I am.

00:43.373 --> 00:44.874
Okay.

00:44.942 --> 00:47.005
Um, I'm Cinzia Pecerra.

00:47.171 --> 00:48.611
Ryan. Newman.

00:48.679 --> 00:49.800
Ryan?

00:49.966 --> 00:51.718
How... Do you mind?

00:53.184 --> 00:54.718
Sure.

00:54.786 --> 00:56.056
Thank you.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.788
So what does Ryan Newman do

00:57.856 --> 00:59.685
when he's not charming
Italian women on the beach?

01:01.359 --> 01:02.521
Well, uh...

01:02.687 --> 01:05.482
Until recently, uh,
I was an attorney.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.898
- Mm-hmm.
- High-profile litigation,

01:07.966 --> 01:09.733
corner office, expense account.

01:09.801 --> 01:13.323
Oh. Sounds awful.

01:13.489 --> 01:15.572
I'm going rollerblading right now.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.441
Do you want to come with me?

01:18.509 --> 01:21.444
Well, what have we here?

01:21.512 --> 01:23.947
And what is that thing above
them, with the mouth and eyes?

01:24.014 --> 01:25.293
This is Wilfred.

01:25.459 --> 01:26.917
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:33.468
Mm.

01:33.634 --> 01:35.193
What? I speak Italian.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.847
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Ryan.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.296
Okay.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.933
I get my things and then we go, okay?

01:40.099 --> 01:42.901
Uh... you're going out with her?

01:42.969 --> 01:44.503
You promised you'd pick up
Jenna's dry-cleaning

01:44.571 --> 01:46.440
and be home by 2:00
for the cable guy.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.900
You expect me to ditch a girl
like that for dry-cleaning?

01:49.066 --> 01:52.912
We all have to make sacrifices, Ryan.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.882
Like the story of Jesus Christ.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.485
I'm sure the Roman soldiers
wanted to hang out

01:58.552 --> 02:00.322
at the Pantheon and stare
at tits all day,

02:00.447 --> 02:03.222
but they knew they had
a duty to kill Jesus.

02:08.127 --> 02:12.257
Uh, I'll take an eighth
of the Walter Cronk.

02:12.423 --> 02:16.595
- For, um, tendonitis.
- Yeah.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.103
I'm on 'shrooms right now.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.138
For my, uh, scraped knee.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.977
A beautiful woman asked
to spend the day with me,

02:26.044 --> 02:27.879
and I said no.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.816
Why?
To pick up Jenna's dry-cleaning?

02:29.982 --> 02:31.950
Face it.
We both love Jenna.

02:32.018 --> 02:34.854
And we live to protect and serve her.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.615
I protect, you serve.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.891
I don't live to serve her.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.894
And I'm not sure spending
your days watching

02:40.962 --> 02:44.414
gruesome cat deaths on YouTube
counts as protecting Jenna.

02:44.580 --> 02:47.133
I have eyes on Jenna at all times.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.586
And, when I'm not watching, Bear is.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.297
Bear?
That rancid teddy bear you hump?

02:52.463 --> 02:55.942
Cojetta Quisley,
I need a 20 on the Golden Fox.

02:57.712 --> 02:59.646
Yes, but is she...

02:59.713 --> 03:00.972
Where is she?

03:01.138 --> 03:02.474
Can you just...

03:02.640 --> 03:04.226
My special today.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.787
One of these free Tootsie Pop
edibles with every purchase.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.650
Well, why didn't you just
say she was in the kitchen?

03:11.816 --> 03:13.526
Jesus.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.162
I swear, the minute you take
the dick out of Bear's mouth,

03:16.230 --> 03:18.114
it's like, "Nyeh, nyeh
nyeh, nyeh, nyeh."

03:18.280 --> 03:19.933
There are my guys!

03:20.001 --> 03:21.735
Hey, who am I pointing to?

03:21.802 --> 03:24.079
The new anchor for the <i>12:00 News.</i>

03:24.245 --> 03:25.371
- Wow.
- Yeah, I start Monday.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.739
That's amazing.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.291
Sorry, mate, random security check.

03:28.457 --> 03:31.294
Uh-oh.
Is that a small-caliber bullet?

03:31.460 --> 03:32.587
- Oh.
- Off.

03:32.753 --> 03:34.589
Sorry. He thinks he's protecting me.

03:34.755 --> 03:35.949
Mr. Goofy.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.510
Thanks.
You did not have to do that.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.188
No problem.
Hey, that's great news about your job.

03:41.313 --> 03:42.764
What do you say we go
out for dinner, and...

03:42.930 --> 03:44.556
Oh, shoot.
I am late for a production meeting.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.060
- You still cool waiting for the cable guy?
- Of course.

03:47.226 --> 03:50.188
I don't know what I
would do without you.

03:50.354 --> 03:53.395
Big Guy for PJ.
Yeah, I've got my eyes all around the bases;

03:53.520 --> 03:54.682
She's just gone in the house.

03:54.807 --> 03:57.970
No, I do not know
where your Discman is.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.072
This isn't the proper channel
for this type of discussion.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.442
Get your head in the game!

04:14.545 --> 04:17.023
This is ridiculous.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.096
Ryan.

04:23.262 --> 04:25.531
- Cincia.
- <i>Ciao.</i>

04:26.566 --> 04:28.059
What are the odds?

04:28.225 --> 04:29.853
I guess it was just meant to be.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.505
I've been watching you run

04:31.573 --> 04:33.231
up and down the beach
for the past hour.

04:33.397 --> 04:37.177
Well, I was just hoping
that maybe we could...

04:37.245 --> 04:38.445
spend some time together.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.649
♪ ♪

05:04.345 --> 05:07.540
This is the best day of my life.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.075
Really?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.352
Seriously.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.728
You know what I did yesterday?

05:11.894 --> 05:13.104
Hm-mm.

05:13.270 --> 05:15.282
I unclogged my sister's drain,

05:15.350 --> 05:18.285
I helped my neighbor hang a pot rack,

05:18.353 --> 05:20.779
and I took Wilfred to
get his ears cleaned.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.781
Wow.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.699
All of these things
that you are doing

05:24.865 --> 05:27.561
are basically for
other people, right?

05:27.629 --> 05:28.912
What do you do for yourself?

05:29.078 --> 05:30.413
I mean...

05:30.579 --> 05:33.634
Life is too short.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.169
I think you really have
to do what makes you happy.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.839
I wouldn't know where to start.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.078
In three days I'll go to Capri,

05:46.146 --> 05:49.081
which is a beautiful island in Italy.

05:49.149 --> 05:52.584
And I have an uncle there who
will let me use his sailboat.

05:52.893 --> 05:55.320
Come with me.

05:55.388 --> 05:57.732
That sounds wonderful.

05:57.898 --> 06:00.068
- See?
- But...

06:00.234 --> 06:01.987
I, I can't.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.989
Okay.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.535
Then let us make the most of
the short time we have lef

06:24.755 --> 06:27.554
So this is more important than
waiting for Jenna's cable guy?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.806
As we speak, Jenna
is sitting at home,

06:29.972 --> 06:33.768
with no Game Show Network,
no MTV2, no Univision.

06:33.934 --> 06:34.936
I'm furious, Ryan.

06:35.166 --> 06:37.767
I'm sorry, but for once in my life,

06:37.835 --> 06:40.317
I'm going to take care
of my needs first.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.193
I think I can make that happen.

06:42.359 --> 06:44.863
Ryan, focus.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.410
Right now, there is a branch
scraping against Jenna's window.

06:47.477 --> 06:50.112
How's she going to get any sleep
tonight if you don't prune it?

06:51.448 --> 06:54.282
Jenna. Jenna.
Jenna. Jenna.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.484
Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. Jenna.

06:56.552 --> 06:57.751
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna...

06:57.917 --> 07:00.188
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,

07:00.256 --> 07:01.629
- Jenna, Jenna...
- Stop!

07:01.858 --> 07:03.506
- Why?
- No, no, no, not... not you.

07:04.861 --> 07:07.063
- Cincia...
- Yeah?

07:09.767 --> 07:12.202
Let's do it.

07:12.270 --> 07:13.475
Let's go to Italy.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.742
Italy?

07:17.809 --> 07:19.773
You didn't ask me if
you could go to Italy.

07:20.012 --> 07:22.947
As of now, we are
officially not speaking.

07:30.866 --> 07:32.118
Wilfred, get...

07:45.214 --> 07:46.207
Ryan,

07:46.332 --> 07:48.218
you know that all I want
is for you to be happy,

07:48.384 --> 07:49.534
but you barely know this woman.

07:49.601 --> 07:51.169
And what about that
cute girl next door

07:51.237 --> 07:52.472
you're always talking about?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.350
Please tell me you didn't hear that.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.977
- Hear what?
- Nothing.

07:58.143 --> 07:59.945
Here's ten dollars.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.281
I'm buying the unopened
food processor

08:02.348 --> 08:03.482
I gave you last Christmas.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.819
Okay?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.613
So, this is really happening, huh?

08:08.779 --> 08:10.990
This Cinzia must be amazing.

08:11.156 --> 08:12.859
She is.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.829
I just hope we can be as
happy as you and Drew.

08:19.915 --> 08:22.001
What's wrong?

08:22.167 --> 08:26.371
I'm sorry. It's just that...

08:26.439 --> 08:29.574
Well, I don't tell you enough,
but you mean so much to me.

08:29.642 --> 08:33.510
And... I've never met anyone
so kind and thoughtful.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.080
And I'm going to miss you.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.895
I'll miss you, too.

08:44.523 --> 08:47.402
But we know who's really
going to miss you.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.820
Wilfred! Come here!

08:50.398 --> 08:52.332
He's been kind of mopey lately.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.001
I know this sounds crazy,

08:54.069 --> 08:55.743
but it's almost like
he knows you're leaving.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.807
Just so you know,
I only came over here

08:59.874 --> 09:01.082
because Jenna called me.

09:01.248 --> 09:03.626
Oh, God, Wilfred pooped on your lawn.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.345
There's symbolism in that poop, Ryan.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.980
And some grass.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.148
And half a slipper.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.467
I'm going to go clean it up.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.784
No, no, no-no-no, wait.
That's dangerous.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.819
- There's dangerous bacteria in that poop.
- Wilfred!

09:14.887 --> 09:16.181
- Get out of the way.
- You shouldn't, shouldn't eat it.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.726
Just because I'm leaving,

09:20.793 --> 09:23.362
it doesn't mean that we
can't still be friends.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.030
Friends?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.366
What, you thought
we were actually...?

09:27.434 --> 09:30.168
Ha-ha! Ha, ha, ha.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.437
That is hilarious.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.173
And a little embarrassing
for you, because...

09:35.241 --> 09:37.410
I never really saw us like that.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.871
How much for this
piece-of-shit flat-screen TV?

09:40.037 --> 09:41.912
You're selling the TV?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.513
That is the cornerstone
of our friendship!

09:50.654 --> 09:52.634
Wilfred.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.091
Just before my tenth birthday,

09:55.159 --> 09:57.927
my dad sent my mom
away to the sanitarium.

09:59.797 --> 10:03.186
All I wanted for that
birthday was a magic set.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.503
But you know what my dad gave me?

10:06.673 --> 10:07.941
A briefcase.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.695
He said, "Ryan, no more nonsense."

10:12.913 --> 10:17.084
I spent my whole life trying
to be who he wanted me to be,

10:17.152 --> 10:20.078
because I was afraid he was
going to send me away, too.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.422
Wow.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.926
That... that story is long.

10:25.994 --> 10:27.627
And boring as shit.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.466
The point is, it's time
to do what makes me happy.

10:31.533 --> 10:34.035
Look, Ryan, you're leaving
behind everything you love

10:34.103 --> 10:36.104
for a girl you barely know.

10:36.172 --> 10:39.013
And it just makes me wonder why.

10:39.179 --> 10:40.609
Well, what am I supposed to do?

10:40.677 --> 10:42.578
Stick around, and keep
waiting hand and foot

10:42.646 --> 10:44.180
on a girl I can never have?

10:44.248 --> 10:46.249
Like some obedient little lap...

10:49.565 --> 10:50.942
You were gonna say "lap dog."

10:51.108 --> 10:52.756
That's what you think
of me, isn't it?

10:54.126 --> 10:56.998
Just a silly dog who thinks his duties
are far more important

10:57.123 --> 10:58.533
- than they really are.
- Wilfred...

10:58.699 --> 11:02.199
Of course, what
a bloody fool I've been.

11:02.267 --> 11:03.997
Jenna doesn't need me anymore.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.036
Maybe she never even did.

11:07.104 --> 11:09.772
You know, I had dreams too, Ryan.

11:09.840 --> 11:12.574
I wanted to herd sheep.

11:12.642 --> 11:16.676
I... I wanted to sniff
out drugs for the DEA.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.179
Or maybe I just wanted
to go to Italy like you.

11:20.345 --> 11:22.084
You never know.

11:22.152 --> 11:23.975
We could to go Italy...

11:24.141 --> 11:26.477
Really?! So you and
your whore would take me?

11:26.643 --> 11:27.812
- Uh...
- Yes!

11:27.978 --> 11:29.493
Yes, Ryan, the answer's yes.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.628
I will come with you.

11:30.695 --> 11:32.196
Oh, Ryan.

11:32.264 --> 11:34.277
Oh, Ryan, you're the
best friend I ever had.

11:37.503 --> 11:38.937
Ryan.

11:39.004 --> 11:40.905
Ryan, check it out.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.841
I've got a list
of common Italian phrases

11:42.908 --> 11:44.871
you're going to need to know.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.045
Geez, Wilfred, we don't even know if

11:47.113 --> 11:48.916
Jenna's going to let you go yet.

11:49.082 --> 11:50.877
Why so negative?

11:51.043 --> 11:55.086
Someone needs a little
attitude adjustment.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.023
No, thanks.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.761
Pot candy's way too intense for me.

12:03.229 --> 12:06.131
I'm on the air in an hour,
and my hair looks terrible,

12:06.199 --> 12:08.770
and these Middle-Eastern names
are impossible to pronounce,

12:09.001 --> 12:11.003
and to top it all off, the
battery in my hybrid is dead.

12:11.070 --> 12:12.106
What the shit!

12:12.272 --> 12:13.605
Relax. I'll get my keys.

12:13.673 --> 12:15.610
Ryan, ask her if I can go to Italy.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.445
Are you sure?
You do so much for me.

12:17.611 --> 12:18.529
Of course. We're friends.

12:18.695 --> 12:20.114
Ask her, ask her, ask her.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.546
Now is not a good time.

12:21.614 --> 12:22.581
Is now a good time?

12:22.649 --> 12:24.077
How about now? Now?

12:24.243 --> 12:26.185
How about now, Ryan?
What about now?

12:26.253 --> 12:27.754
Is it a good time now?

12:27.821 --> 12:28.873
How about now?

12:29.039 --> 12:30.792
Now? What about now?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.169
- How about now?
- I don't know, Wilfred.

12:33.335 --> 12:34.994
Jenna's life is going
through some big changes.

12:35.062 --> 12:37.048
I think she's going
to need you more than ever.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.832
She'll be fine.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.949
She'll probably have a team of
highly trained security specialists

12:43.074 --> 12:44.571
around her at all times.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.391
This is the noon news
we're talking about.

12:47.675 --> 12:48.708
Oh...

12:48.776 --> 12:49.769
You okay?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.678
I'm just a little light-headed.

12:51.745 --> 12:53.279
The only thing I had to eat today

12:53.347 --> 12:54.899
was a piece of candy at your house.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.295
- House...
- What candy?

12:57.420 --> 12:59.779
That word is weird... hou-u-se.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.532
Wilfred, Jenna ate the Tootsie Pot.

13:02.698 --> 13:06.147
No way, mate.
Jenna doesn't do drugs.

13:06.272 --> 13:08.326
If she ate that, she'd
be totally freaking out.

13:11.818 --> 13:14.267
<i>This is the News at Noon</i>
<i>with Jenna Mueller,</i>

13:14.335 --> 13:16.769
<i>Cal Fugasaki with sports</i>

13:16.837 --> 13:18.537
<i>and Bud Mitchell with the weather.</i>

13:21.257 --> 13:22.718
And... action.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.694
What?

13:27.436 --> 13:30.026
Good afternoon and welcome
to the <i>News at Noon.</i>

13:30.651 --> 13:33.119
Um, let's start with sports...

13:33.187 --> 13:35.221
Look at my mic.

13:35.289 --> 13:37.791
It's like a shiny little cl...

13:40.819 --> 13:43.114
Ryan, I've got to save her!

13:43.280 --> 13:47.034
Cal, you got to feel
how soft my tits are...

13:54.082 --> 13:55.126
Drew.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.818
Come on in, Ryan-oceros.

13:56.885 --> 13:58.546
I flew in right after Jenna
told me what happened.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.422
Undies on the face,
undies on the face!

14:01.490 --> 14:04.135
- What a silly dog I am.
- Wilfred, no.

14:04.301 --> 14:08.181
What, you think you can do
better than undies on the face?

14:08.347 --> 14:11.601
Hey, Jenna.
I just came over to see how you were doing.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.804
How am I doing?
They fired me.

14:13.929 --> 14:15.539
They think I was on drugs.

14:15.664 --> 14:17.425
I've never even had
a speeding ticket.

14:17.550 --> 14:18.691
Hey, you know what, babe?

14:18.857 --> 14:21.041
I bet you just had a mini stroke.

14:21.108 --> 14:24.155
Yeah, I've seen newscasters
get those on YouTube.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.656
It's actually really funny.

14:25.822 --> 14:28.281
- I didn't have a stroke, Drew.
- Jenna, look!

14:28.349 --> 14:31.051
My ear flipped inside out
and I can't fix it.

14:33.788 --> 14:35.750
Ha-ha, silly dog.

14:35.916 --> 14:39.093
She wants to sue the station,
but we can't afford a lawyer.

14:39.161 --> 14:41.762
And I hope she just
moves back to Wisconsin.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.425
I, uh, I asked her
to marry me last night.

14:46.402 --> 14:47.720
What'd she say?

14:47.886 --> 14:50.873
Well, she thinks I'm a total dick

14:50.941 --> 14:53.342
for asking at a time like this.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.045
She's thinking about it.

14:56.113 --> 14:57.355
I like my chances.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.942
Fingers crossed.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.444
Oh, is that glass door open?

15:03.610 --> 15:06.422
Some dogs would think
it was closed, but not a silly dog!

15:06.490 --> 15:07.723
Jenna, look!

15:09.927 --> 15:11.869
Son of a whore!

15:14.565 --> 15:16.958
It was my fault, Ryan.

15:17.124 --> 15:20.805
Why? Because she ate that pot candy?

15:20.930 --> 15:22.004
You couldn't know.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.676
It was my job to know.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.304
Ugh.

15:32.889 --> 15:36.055
I was too distracted
by my own selfish needs.

15:36.122 --> 15:38.524
I was wrong, Ryan.

15:38.591 --> 15:41.593
Jenna still needs me.

15:41.660 --> 15:44.026
It's my duty to protect her.

15:46.027 --> 15:50.491
I guess Italy will just have
to wait for us.

15:50.657 --> 15:52.326
Us?

15:55.441 --> 15:57.642
Well, yeah.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.844
Jenna needs you, too.

15:59.912 --> 16:02.503
You're a lawyer, right?

16:02.669 --> 16:05.464
I can't. I'm sorry.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.502
You don't get it.
I ruined Jenna's life,

16:10.627 --> 16:12.025
and there's nothing
I can do to fix it.

16:12.092 --> 16:13.293
You have to help her.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.724
No, you don't get it.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.063
Jenna's going to marry Drew.
They can work it out.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.436
She's not my problem anymore.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.266
So what, you're going to punish her

16:21.334 --> 16:24.369
just because your stupid little
puppy dog crush is unrequited?

16:24.437 --> 16:25.970
She'll be fine.

16:26.038 --> 16:27.939
If there's one thing Jenna's good at,

16:28.006 --> 16:29.864
it's getting other people
to do things for her.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.074
Ryan, I've always had
your best interests at heart.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.410
And I've never asked
for anything in return...

16:36.328 --> 16:39.116
... except for a bunch of stuff.

16:39.184 --> 16:43.210
Please, I'm asking you
to make a sacrifice.

16:43.376 --> 16:45.524
I'm sorry.

16:45.591 --> 16:47.006
I'm gog to Italy with Cinzia.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.598
Sleep on it, Ryan.
Sleep on it.

17:29.172 --> 17:30.508
Wilfred?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.000
Ryan Newman.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.351
You stand accused

17:34.476 --> 17:37.271
of ditching out on the cable guy,

17:37.339 --> 17:40.893
Not coming up with anything better
than undies on the face...

17:41.059 --> 17:42.728
Wh-What is all this?

17:42.894 --> 17:45.712
... and the gravest of all charges--

17:45.780 --> 17:50.778
selfishly fusing to make a
sacrifice for the one you love.

17:50.944 --> 17:55.366
These charges are very serious.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.910
They're very serious charges.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.997
As for the seriousness
of these charges,

18:01.163 --> 18:02.456
well, they...

18:02.622 --> 18:04.398
Well, very serious.

18:04.465 --> 18:06.252
And they're charges.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.504
Wh-What are you talking about?

18:08.670 --> 18:11.882
Mr. Newman, it would be wise
to let your counsel speak for you.

18:14.174 --> 18:15.208
Bear?

18:15.276 --> 18:16.576
Well, you could have

18:16.644 --> 18:18.011
represented yourself,

18:18.079 --> 18:21.559
but you refused to be a lawyer again.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.184
Why is that, Mr. Newman?

18:23.351 --> 18:25.146
I-I don't want to get into that.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.231
Who is the archeologist?

18:27.397 --> 18:28.274
That's in the past.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.357
The witness will answer.

18:29.524 --> 18:30.725
Who is the archeologist?!

18:30.793 --> 18:31.777
I am!

18:33.361 --> 18:34.697
That's what they used to call you

18:34.864 --> 18:36.164
at your father's firm, isn't it?

18:36.232 --> 18:38.868
Because you used to dig up
dirt on the opposition?

18:39.034 --> 18:40.411
All right, I admit it.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.204
What I did was completely unethical.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.638
But I was only trying
to please my father.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.088
You want to talk
about ethics?

18:46.213 --> 18:47.655
Is it not unethical

18:47.780 --> 18:50.532
to desert the woman you love

18:50.785 --> 18:51.777
in her time of need?

18:51.845 --> 18:53.861
- Me.
- No, me.

18:53.986 --> 18:54.780
No.

18:54.847 --> 18:56.844
Please, I just want to be happy.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.220
How can you be happy

18:58.386 --> 18:59.752
knowing that Jenna's
life will be ruined

18:59.820 --> 19:01.098
if you abandon her?

19:01.264 --> 19:04.090
We all have to make sacrifices
for the people we love.

19:04.157 --> 19:06.312
It's time to make a choice.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.522
What are you going to do?

19:08.688 --> 19:11.442
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,

19:11.608 --> 19:15.334
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna...

19:15.402 --> 19:17.490
What are you going to do?!

19:20.241 --> 19:22.787
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,

19:22.953 --> 19:24.997
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna...

19:45.671 --> 19:48.087
Take care, huh?
<i>Adios.</i>

20:00.090 --> 20:02.901
I guess we all
have to make sacrifices.

20:04.069 --> 20:05.316
Yes, we do.

20:06.611 --> 20:08.040
I'm curious, Ryan.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.501
What changed your mind?

20:15.005 --> 20:16.590
I had a dream.

20:18.073 --> 20:22.721
Well, never underestimate
the power of a dream.
