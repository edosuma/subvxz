00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.436
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.571 --> 00:05.106
sexually based offenses

00:05.139 --> 00:06.507
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.642
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.676 --> 00:10.644
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.678 --> 00:12.180
are members of an elite squad

00:12.213 --> 00:14.215
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.184
These are their stories.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.453
- I'm Sheila Porter,

00:19.487 --> 00:21.089
Noah's grandmother.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.823
I lost my husband

00:22.856 --> 00:24.392
and my daughter.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.427
I don't want to lose
my grandchild.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.130
- I want what's best
for my son.

00:29.163 --> 00:32.066
Noah, this is Sheila.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.335
- We're going to get
to know each other.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.338
- You don't have to prove to me
that you're a good mother.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.274
- I just want Noah to know
how much I love him.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.542
- Would it be okay if I

00:41.575 --> 00:44.545
bought Noah a nice,
warm winter jacket?

00:44.578 --> 00:48.816
- I think that he would
absolutely love that.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.352
- Why don't you take a look
at yourself in the mirror?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.457
Let's try.. this one.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.460
Noah!

01:01.862 --> 01:05.133
*

01:05.166 --> 01:08.436
- Hey, Sheila.

01:08.469 --> 01:11.439
What?

01:11.472 --> 01:12.840
When?

01:12.873 --> 01:15.276
Don't move.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.411
The closest precinct
to the Mall of Manhattan.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.846
I need an answer.
- Midtown South.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.549
- Okay, I need all available,
ASAP.

01:21.582 --> 01:22.783
Missing kid!

01:26.220 --> 01:27.455
- No, I'm not.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.589
It's Noah.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.823
- I'll drive.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.796
*

01:35.829 --> 01:37.465
- Let's go!
There's so much traffic.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.666
Go around!

01:38.699 --> 01:46.106
*

01:48.642 --> 01:50.711
Sheila!

01:50.744 --> 01:53.147
- I am so sorry, Olivia.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.682
I just turned away
and he was gone.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.752
- It was in the store.
We were, um, trying on coats,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.454
and, uh--and I turned away

02:00.488 --> 02:01.822
to get a different one
with a hood.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.191
It wasn't even ten seconds.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.227
- No, no.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.428
- Of course not.
- Well, I'm just trying

02:07.461 --> 02:08.429
to figure out what happened,

02:08.462 --> 02:09.630
because he doesn't walk away

02:09.663 --> 02:10.664
when I'm with him,

02:10.698 --> 02:12.366
so what happened?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.934
What were you talking about?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.236
- I don't know.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.371
Something about the--
the hood.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.273
- Okay, and you checked
the entire store?

02:19.307 --> 02:20.374
- Yes, with the manager.

02:20.408 --> 02:21.409
He wasn't anywhere.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.643
That's when I called you.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.512
- Yes, she notified security
at 10:15 a.m.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.614
- Okay, that's 30 minutes ago,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.682
so you have this entire place
on lockdown?

02:28.716 --> 02:29.917
- We have the main exits.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.885
- No, sir, that's not
good enough.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.822
I need a guard at every single
access point, now.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.957
- I know, he's probably
hiding under a clothes rack

02:36.990 --> 02:39.260
or sneaked off to a toy store.
- No, sir, that's not my son.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.528
- We've got six floors here.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.396
- And I don't care
if you have 60.

02:42.430 --> 02:45.333
You lock it down--all of it--
now.

02:45.366 --> 02:48.269
- Looking for a five-year-old
Caucasian boy.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.538
All right?
4 feet tall, 45 pounds.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.972
He's five years old,

02:52.005 --> 02:53.541
about four feet tall.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.975
He's wearing a green jacket.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.245
- White Adidas,
long-sleeved black shirt.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.312
Got it?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415
He's four feet tall.
He's got wavy brown hair.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.483
He's got brown eyes.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.651
- We're missing
a five-year-old.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.718
He's about four feet tall.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.220
- Excuse me!
Everyone stop walking!

03:06.254 --> 03:07.355
Has anybody seen this kid?

03:07.388 --> 03:13.661
*

03:16.697 --> 03:23.737
*

03:59.607 --> 04:00.841
- Olivia!

04:00.874 --> 04:02.009
Please tell me that
you've heard

04:02.042 --> 04:03.677
something!
- I'll call you back.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.513
- Ugh, I was so stupid.
How can I be so stupid?

04:05.546 --> 04:06.514
- Sheila, please go
and sit down.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.916
Just sit down, please.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.684
- I've checked two toy shops
and a candy store.

04:10.718 --> 04:14.322
- Amanda, he wouldn't
wander off.

04:14.355 --> 04:17.325
Somebody took him.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.460
- I doubt if that's
gonna happen, Chief.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.894
- She's emotional.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.796
That means she's liable
to make rash decisions.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.332
- Oh, you think
you've seen emotional,

04:24.365 --> 04:25.699
wait till I tell her this.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.368
- I'm not asking, Detective.
This is an order,

04:27.401 --> 04:29.437
and if she ignores it,
it's both your asses.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.605
I'll be there as soon as I can.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.575
- That was Dodds.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.043
All available police resources

04:36.076 --> 04:37.645
are open to us.
- Oh, that's comforting.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.780
- And there's more.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.781
You're off the case, Liv.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.082
- That's not happening.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.951
- He says you're a victim
in this one.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.719
- You're damn right I am.
- He says if you stay involved,

04:45.753 --> 04:46.920
you could screw
the whole thing up--

04:46.954 --> 04:48.656
that's his opinion,
not mine--

04:48.689 --> 04:49.657
and your job.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.792
- Mine, too.
- Stop, Fin.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.362
I'm not leaving.
Stop.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.997
- Oh, my God!

04:57.030 --> 04:59.333
I live two blocks
away from here.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.701
Maybe he walked home.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.869
- Okay.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.871
- Okay, Dodds is on his way.
Go with her.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.872
Maybe she'll
remember something.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.474
I got it.
- Okay.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.010
Noah?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.111
Sweetie?

05:12.713 --> 05:14.415
Sweetheart?
- Noah!

05:14.448 --> 05:15.549
Are you here?

05:17.518 --> 05:18.486
- Noah!

05:19.787 --> 05:21.622
Okay, check--
check, uh,

05:21.655 --> 05:23.491
Check the schoolyard,
check, um...

05:23.524 --> 05:24.792
Check the playground, okay?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.026
And call me back.
- Wait a minute.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.761
What if he goes
to your apartment

05:27.795 --> 05:28.762
and nobody's there?
- I already have a car

05:28.796 --> 05:29.830
sitting outside.

05:29.863 --> 05:30.964
Sheila, listen to me.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.434
Did you talk to anyone
at the mall?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.669
- Just the sales lady.
- Okay, is it possible

05:35.703 --> 05:36.870
that somebody was watching you?

05:36.904 --> 05:38.506
- I don't know.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.040
- Think, Sheila, think.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.375
- I am trying!

05:41.409 --> 05:42.910
It's not like I wanted this
to happen.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.378
- Nobody--nobody
is saying that.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.146
- Oh, you don't have to.
Your eyes did.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.915
- Nobody is accusing you.
Just stop.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.484
- Oh, I should've just
held his hand.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.520
- Yes, you should've.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.754
Oh.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.789
I took that photo.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.158
I took it of Ellie
at my sister's cabin.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.060
We were celebrating
her first rehab.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.762
She loved walking
in the woods.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.797
- Sheila, please.
I need you to listen to me.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.865
I need you to think.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.934
A detail, anything...

06:06.967 --> 06:09.069
- Wait--wait a minute.
We went to Starbucks.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.004
We went to Starbucks
and we ordered a hot chocolate.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.910
- And I saw a man there,
and he had, um...

06:16.944 --> 06:18.111
long sideburns.
What do you call them?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.581
- Mutton chops.
- Yes, that's it.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.950
He was wearing
a brown bomber jacket,

06:22.983 --> 06:26.754
and he asked Noah if he was
a Jets or Giants fan,

06:26.787 --> 06:28.489
and then I saw him again

06:28.522 --> 06:31.625
at the department store
and he waved to me.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.060
- And--and this happened
near the coats?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.429
- Yeah.
Rollins?

06:35.463 --> 06:38.899
We may be looking for a suspect
in a brown bomber jacket

06:38.932 --> 06:40.868
with mutton chops, okay?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.870
How old was he?
- Oh, maybe 30.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.705
- Okay, about 30 years old.
Height?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.740
- Uh, 5'10"-ish.
- About 5'10".

06:46.774 --> 06:48.108
- Got it.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.878
Hey, possible suspect
is a 5'10" white male

06:50.911 --> 06:52.980
with mutton chops
and a brown bomber coat.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.583
- Okay, either you've seen him
or you didn't.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.852
- I think I may have seen him
over by the perfume store.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.855
It was--he was wearing
a blue sweatshirt,

07:01.889 --> 07:04.992
but the guy I saw him with
definitely wasn't...

07:06.259 --> 07:07.728
- White.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
I'm pretty sure
he was Hispanic.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.131
Uh, I mean Latino.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.734
- No--no fancy sideburns,
but they were rushing.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.035
I definitely remember that.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.670
- You said the boy
was with a Latino guy?

07:16.704 --> 07:17.971
- That's right.
I figured they were

07:18.005 --> 07:19.940
about to miss a train
or something.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.576
When I came in, he was shoving
something into the trash can.

07:23.977 --> 07:27.715
- Uh, I'm in from Jersey.
I don't really know.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.584
- Okay, where were you standing
when you saw them?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.486
- Um...

07:32.520 --> 07:34.121
- Yo! Yo, guy!

07:34.154 --> 07:35.789
Hey!
I was talking to you.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.090
What's going on?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.626
Tell me about your conversation

07:38.659 --> 07:40.661
with this kid.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.630
- Yeah, I was on line,
getting coffee.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.897
He was with his mom.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.666
She was... worth
getting to know, you know?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.167
To pick up women?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.636
- Well, it's better than
the fresh fruit section

07:48.669 --> 07:49.637
at Whole Foods.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.971
Besides, I needed pants.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.907
For my bike club.
It's cool, right?

07:53.941 --> 07:55.108
I'm an accountant, but...

07:55.142 --> 07:57.010
we get a little macho
on Sundays.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.812
- And that was the only time
you spoke to him?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.113
- Yep.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.181
I saw him again in the store,

08:01.214 --> 08:02.916
just before I found the pants.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.685
I waved,
but she didn't notice.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.921
*

08:07.955 --> 08:09.122
- Hey, Fin.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.691
Sales girl swears
Mr. Mutton Chops

08:10.724 --> 08:12.225
was in the dressing room,
trying on different sizes,

08:12.259 --> 08:13.026
for over an hour.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.795
I talked to this one woman
that said

08:14.828 --> 08:16.530
she saw Noah leave
with a Hispanic guy.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.798
- I talked to a guy who said

08:17.831 --> 08:18.832
he seen a Hispanic guy
with a kid.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.967
- Well, she said she saw him

08:20.000 --> 08:21.201
stuff something
in the garbage can

08:21.234 --> 08:22.936
by the entrance
when she was coming in.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.071
- Gotta be a hundred trash cans
in this place.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.072
- But there's only
eight entrances.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.073
- There's a couple over here

08:26.106 --> 08:28.876
by this perfume spot.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.880
- Excuse me.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.214
- Hey, yo!

08:34.247 --> 08:39.052
*

08:39.086 --> 08:41.154
- Get CSU over here
at the southeast exit.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.323
- They went out those doors.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.660
*

08:46.694 --> 08:48.596
There's Noah with the man
they described.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.731
- Security cams picked him up
in the parking garage.

08:50.764 --> 08:57.971
*

09:00.741 --> 09:02.743
- A kidnapper
with a car seat?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.844
- He came prepared.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.014
- Maybe he's not a stranger.

09:07.047 --> 09:14.254
*

09:19.392 --> 09:21.261
- All right, they're headed
towards the northwest exit.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.897
- It's like there's mud
smeared on that license plate.

09:23.931 --> 09:31.138
*

09:32.305 --> 09:35.175
- But the last three letters
are DKC.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.910
- I'll call Real-Time Crime.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.846
*

09:38.879 --> 09:41.081
- Hold up.
What's up with the blue hoodie?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.751
Didn't Liv say he had on
a black long

09:43.784 --> 09:46.987
*

09:47.020 --> 09:49.156
It's me.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.959
Listen, are you sure Noah
wasn't wearing a blue shirt?

09:51.992 --> 09:54.161
- Yes, yes.
Why, what is it?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.829
- Because security cams
have him

09:55.863 --> 09:57.030
in a blue hoodie.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.766
- Hold on.
Sheila, are you sure

09:58.799 --> 10:00.834
that he was wearing
a black shirt

10:00.868 --> 10:02.169
under the green jacket?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.637
- Positive.
- You're sure that

10:03.671 --> 10:05.005
it wasn't a blue hoodie?

10:05.038 --> 10:06.406
- No, he was in a black
long-sleeved shirt.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.407
- Okay, no, it was black.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.942
- Yeah, I-I heard.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.911
So the guy must have
brought it with him.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.680
Liv, this wasn't spontaneous.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.047
- Okay, what--
but what guy?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.783
*

10:15.816 --> 10:17.117
- I'll send you a screenshot.

10:17.150 --> 10:21.054
*

10:25.826 --> 10:33.033
*

10:35.803 --> 10:37.705
- Sheila...

10:37.738 --> 10:39.773
do you recognize this guy?

10:39.807 --> 10:41.675
*

10:41.709 --> 10:42.876
Do you think he took him?

10:42.910 --> 10:44.144
- Just look at the photo.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.979
*

10:46.013 --> 10:47.047
- No.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.882
- Come on.
At the apartment,

10:48.916 --> 10:51.819
at the school,
at the store, maybe.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.953
Look.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.689
- No, no,
I've never seen him.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.827
*

10:59.860 --> 11:02.830
Please, God,
not again.

11:02.863 --> 11:08.435
*

11:08.468 --> 11:11.171
- Yep, got it.
We're on our way.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.774
Hey, we just got a hit
on the Amber alert.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.777
The car is parked in Ridgewood,
New Jersey.

11:16.810 --> 11:22.716
*

11:22.750 --> 11:24.451
- Hey, the plates came back
stolen.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.485
- Grab the VIN.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.387
- That's a bus station
right there.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.223
We gotta tell her.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.992
- I'll get started on the VIN.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.261
*

11:34.294 --> 11:35.195
- Hey.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.496
Yeah, yeah, we got the car.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.732
It's abandoned.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.367
- Well, we're running the VIN,
and we got local cops--

11:40.400 --> 11:42.369
- No, no, no.
I want you to do it.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.271
- The thing is, Liv, it's...

11:44.304 --> 11:46.039
The car's parked
at a bus station.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.275
*

11:48.308 --> 11:51.511
- I want to know everything
as soon as you know it.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.913
Do you understand me?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.514
*

11:56.349 --> 11:58.451
- They found the car
at a bus station.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.121
- Oh, God...

12:01.154 --> 12:02.455
They could be anywhere.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.158
*

12:05.192 --> 12:06.994
- I can't breathe.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.095
- Here.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.362
Come here.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.898
No.

12:10.931 --> 12:15.102
*

12:19.139 --> 12:19.472
.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.240
- Yeah, the man got into it
with me.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.475
About what?

12:22.509 --> 12:23.977
- About the price
of the kid's ticket.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.312
It's peak travel,
so even though children

12:25.345 --> 12:26.446
usually get a discount,

12:26.479 --> 12:27.514
not at peak.
No can do.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.052
- The 220.
Left about 40 minutes ago.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.453
You want me to tell the driver
to stop?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.855
- Do not say anything
to anybody.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.156
- We don't want
to alert the passengers.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.058
What's the bus's next stop?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.794
- Scranton, Pennsylvania.
Yeah, it's me.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.462
We need to get rolling
on the New Jersey state police.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.065
There's been an accident
on I-80.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.333
Looks like the bus
is stuck in traffic.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.436
- About ten miles away.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.176
- You can't--
you can't think like that.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.510
- I know, but...

12:57.544 --> 12:59.479
- Sheila, we're gonna
get him back.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.214
- Oh, he could be
anywhere right now.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.016
I've been through this.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.085
I know the odds
of finding a child.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.154
- This is different, Sheila.
- No, it's not.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.589
- Ellie didn't want
to be found, Sheila.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.495
*

13:15.528 --> 13:17.364
I'm sorry.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.066
I'm very sorry.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.502
*

13:22.535 --> 13:25.072
I'm scared out of my mind.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.840
That's all.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.109
- You don't have to be sorry
for anything.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.111
*

13:31.144 --> 13:33.446
You cry and you scream.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.983
You're--as a mother,
you're entitled.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.252
*

13:40.287 --> 13:42.322
- Move!

13:45.358 --> 13:49.062
*

13:49.096 --> 13:51.131
- We must be getting close
to the accident.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.432
- Hold on.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.468
*

13:55.502 --> 13:57.137
- Here we go.
Here we go.

13:57.170 --> 14:04.211
*

14:09.382 --> 14:11.284
Come on!

14:11.318 --> 14:12.886
*

14:12.920 --> 14:15.923
All right, no reason
to get excited, people.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.125
Just looking for a little boy.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.427
We're looking for
a little boy.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.329
Police!
Open up.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.565
*

14:25.598 --> 14:27.200
- Sorry, never saw
either one of them.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.170
- And you saw everybody
that came on this bus?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.371
- Took their tickets.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.109
They're not on the bus.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.945
- So he bought two tickets,
made sure the gal

14:37.978 --> 14:39.446
at the bus station got a
good look at both of them.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.181
- The SOB could be anywhere.

14:41.214 --> 14:47.054
*

14:47.087 --> 14:48.922
- Traced this car
to your lot.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.457
Was it stolen?
- Nah, wasn't stolen.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.658
Guy got a hell of a deal,
though.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.260
Looks like my mother-in-law,

14:53.293 --> 14:54.361
but runs like that Bolt kid.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.196
- Some guy.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.398
Paid cash,
a grand out the door.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.033
Kind of funny.
All he cared about

15:00.067 --> 15:01.601
was whether
his kiddie seat fit.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.336
No joke: thing probably cost
more than the car.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.239
- Brand new,
box and everything.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.609
Spent half an hour
wedging the seat in there.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.229
- So these are
all sex offenders?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.530
- These are the ones
that we know about.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.731
The man that was in the video

15:31.764 --> 15:33.266
wasn't in any of our databases,

15:33.300 --> 15:36.603
so I want you to look
at the registry

15:36.636 --> 15:39.039
and see if there's anyone
that you recognize.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.240
- I don't really understand,
though.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.009
I mean, if he's not
in the registry,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.443
what's the point of going
through the photos?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.979
- I know it's a long shot,
but I...

15:46.013 --> 15:48.281
Maybe he has an accomplice.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.052
- Liv.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.220
- Please don't tell me that

15:53.253 --> 15:54.254
it's going to be okay.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.156
- Could this have anything
to do with the job?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.258
- The question's not
if there are threats.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.659
It's which ones
to take seriously,

15:59.692 --> 16:00.760
and her time on this job--

16:00.793 --> 16:02.195
it's a lot of grudges.

16:02.229 --> 16:03.663
- Jesus.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.700
- Do you know how many times
I've told parents to stay calm?

16:10.137 --> 16:12.672
You don't know how ridiculous
it is until it happens to you.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.441
- I don't know what to do.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.542
Um...

16:15.575 --> 16:16.643
Do you want some coffee?
Do you--

16:16.676 --> 16:18.045
- I just want my son!

16:18.078 --> 16:19.779
- Okay--hey, hey, hey.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.683
- All I can think of is

16:23.716 --> 16:25.785
tonight is spaghetti night.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.055
Noah loves spaghetti night.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.522
- Come here.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.757
Here.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.326
*

16:33.360 --> 16:35.295
- They tossed his jacket,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.464
and they put a different
sweatshirt on him,

16:37.497 --> 16:39.032
one that fit.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.333
They planned this, Rafa.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.734
It wasn't some random freak.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.703
*

16:43.736 --> 16:46.406
Somebody specifically targeted
my son.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.175
- We got something, Liv.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.610
The car seat box had
a sticker on it with a barcode.

16:50.643 --> 16:53.646
We traced the code to a store
called Awesome Baby in Chelsea.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.148
- Go.
Get somebody there now.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.549
- Carisi's already moving.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.252
- Okay, okay.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.787
Okay.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.590
*

17:03.623 --> 17:04.724
- Here we go.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.326
It was purchased
three days ago.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.530
- Credit card.
The buyer was, uh--

17:10.563 --> 17:11.831
I remember--
beautiful eyes.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.366
Her name's Sheila Porter.

17:16.403 --> 17:20.440
*

17:21.508 --> 17:22.609
- Hey.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.211
- Liv, listen to me.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.345
It's her.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.579
Sheila took Noah.

17:26.613 --> 17:33.786
*

17:36.123 --> 17:38.391
Sheila!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.760
- Said she was going home.
She didn't want to bother you.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.695
- That's--come on.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.531
- I'll tell you on the way!

17:47.600 --> 17:50.370
*

17:50.403 --> 17:51.704
Clear.

17:51.738 --> 17:59.146
*

18:00.647 --> 18:02.282
Clear.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.416
- Clear.

18:03.450 --> 18:07.420
*

18:10.290 --> 18:11.524
- There's still clothes
in the closet

18:11.558 --> 18:12.825
and stuff in the bathroom.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.527
- I gave her my kid.

18:14.561 --> 18:16.363
- She may be coming back, Liv.

18:16.396 --> 18:20.633
*

18:20.667 --> 18:21.801
- She's not coming back.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.270
- Glass half full, Liv.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.206
- That has nothing to do
with it.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.907
She took the only thing
that mattered to her.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.509
She took the photo of Ellie.

18:29.542 --> 18:34.681
*

18:34.714 --> 18:35.882
She's never coming back.

18:35.915 --> 18:38.451
*

18:42.422 --> 18:42.589
.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.190
- Hey.
- Hey, Lieutenant.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.792
Sheila's gone dark.
The last call

18:45.825 --> 18:46.893
she made
was this morning.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.295
TARU's tracking her cell phone,

18:48.328 --> 18:49.662
but it looks like
she turned it off.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.531
- Credit cards.
- Nothing since yesterday.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.200
A Chinese restaurant around
the corner from her house

18:53.233 --> 18:54.567
at about 1:12 p.m.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.436
- Okay.
She emptied her bank account.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.571
Couple hundred thousand
in the last two weeks.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.540
- Derry, New Hampshire police
checked out her house.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.808
It's empty.
Doesn't look like

19:01.841 --> 19:03.343
it's been lived in for a while,

19:03.376 --> 19:04.944
and utilities were shut off
three months ago.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.746
- That's when she showed up
here.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.881
- Local cops are sitting on the
house in case she shows up.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.584
- The only one registered
to her name

19:11.618 --> 19:12.952
is sitting in her garage
in Derry.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.454
- Check rentals,
all three airports.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.223
- We notified state police.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.824
- Yeah, great.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.460
Which state?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.965
*

19:25.998 --> 19:27.867
- Okay.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.935
Here we go.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.970
*

19:31.003 --> 19:34.507
Here is your burger
with ketchup.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.776
- Did you get me a milkshake,
too?

19:36.809 --> 19:39.212
- Yes, I did.
Vanilla.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.347
Okay, do you want a fry?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.348
- Yes, please.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.749
- Here you go.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.518
- Hm...

19:45.552 --> 19:47.220
Thank you for reminding me.

19:47.254 --> 19:53.493
*

19:53.526 --> 19:56.663
She's not answering.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.764
Hi, Olivia!

19:57.797 --> 19:58.998
It's me and Noah.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.867
We are just calling
to check in.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.936
Give us a ring
when you have a chance, okay?

20:03.970 --> 20:06.439
Say hi to Mommy.
- Hi, Mommy!

20:06.473 --> 20:08.007
- All right,
we're almost there.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.809
*

20:09.842 --> 20:13.946
- All right, let's finish up
and hit the road.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.615
- I screwed up, Rafael.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.284
- No.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.818
This was coordinated,

20:18.851 --> 20:21.254
planned, well-executed.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.356
Look, there's no way you could
have seen this coming, Liv.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.358
- You know what the problem
is with this job?

20:25.392 --> 20:28.328
What good
do we really do?

20:28.361 --> 20:30.730
I mean, we come in
after the fact

20:30.763 --> 20:32.532
with a broom and a mop

20:32.565 --> 20:36.303
and we clean up the mess.

20:37.304 --> 20:40.307
What would really matter,
or would...

20:40.340 --> 20:43.310
really be special is if,
just one time,

20:43.343 --> 20:46.846
we could prevent it
from hitting the floor.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.317
- We prevent the next mess.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.886
- I should have
seen this coming.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.822
As a cop, as a mother,

20:55.855 --> 20:57.023
should have seen this coming.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.926
- Well, you...

21:00.960 --> 21:02.929
- Nothing.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.665
- You can't
punch me harder than

21:05.698 --> 21:07.567
I've already punched myself,
believe me.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.936
- Maybe you wanted this Sheila
thing to work out too much.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.840
Look, maybe all you just wanted
was a family.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.008
- Yeah.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.444
What was I thinking?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.579
- That's...

21:19.612 --> 21:21.848
why I shouldn't have
said anything.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.583
Okay.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.452
Did Sheila mention
anybody?

21:25.485 --> 21:26.819
Friends, family, in New York?

21:26.853 --> 21:28.721
- Don't you think that
I've already racked my brain?

21:28.755 --> 21:31.958
She knew me and she knew Noah.
That's it.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.463
Except for her...

21:36.496 --> 21:37.997
Her lawyer.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.532
Her lawyer.
What was her name?

21:39.566 --> 21:41.334
- Uh...
- Uh, Janet.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.735
Susan Janet.
- Yeah, Susan Janet.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.737
Yeah, I doubt that
Sheila told her attorney

21:44.771 --> 21:46.339
that she was going to
kidnap your son.

21:46.373 --> 21:49.742
- But, I mean,
she's from New Hampshire.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.845
I doubt she knew
any New York lawyers.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.414
She testified that--

21:54.447 --> 21:58.551
that a private investigator
found Noah.

21:58.585 --> 22:02.054
Maybe he recommended Janet.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.690
- Wait, are you thinking that

22:03.723 --> 22:05.892
the PI's the guy in the hoodie?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.697
- You stay here.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.636
- Really don't
have time for this, Rafael.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.671
- Give me what I need,
and you'll be free of me.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.039
- You know I can't talk about

22:20.072 --> 22:22.675
anything a client tells me
in confidence

22:22.709 --> 22:24.777
unless there's
a damn good reason.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.513
- Noah Benson was kidnapped
by Sheila Porter.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.715
How's that?

22:30.049 --> 22:32.652
- I do.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.853
- Whoa, you don't--

22:33.886 --> 22:36.088
you don't think
I actually abetted--

22:36.122 --> 22:37.624
- Of course not.

22:37.657 --> 22:38.725
What I need is the name
of the investigator

22:38.758 --> 22:40.560
who referred Sheila to you.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.395
- Well, that's privileged
communication.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.396
- Come on, Susan.
We both know

22:43.430 --> 22:44.497
how this is gonna go.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.798
- Yeah, I could be disbarred.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.134
- I'm gonna file
a motion to disclose.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.437
The judge is going to give us
a primer on the crime, fraud,

22:50.470 --> 22:52.104
and/or continuing criminal act
exception.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.740
- This is neither.
- The fact is, I'm going to

22:53.773 --> 22:55.074
walk out of there
with an order to disclose,

22:55.107 --> 22:57.076
because no judge wants
a missing kid on his head.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.712
But you can help me now.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.957
His name is Raymond Green.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.124
- Thank you.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.093
- If at all possible,

23:14.126 --> 23:16.028
I didn't send you.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.465
- I wasn't here.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.833
- Sure, I remember her.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.635
She was referred
by my Boston office

23:22.669 --> 23:24.537
once they realized the kid
was living in the city.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.938
- So if Miss Porter
already knew

23:25.972 --> 23:27.640
her grandson
was living in New York,

23:27.674 --> 23:29.208
why would she need
a private investigator?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.010
Don't you even think

23:31.043 --> 23:32.645
about going there, pal.

23:32.679 --> 23:33.913
You must got some balls

23:33.946 --> 23:35.848
to come in here
and accuse me of kidnapping.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.484
Who the hell do you think
you are?

23:37.517 --> 23:38.618
- Just a guy who's been on
the force

23:38.651 --> 23:39.852
for two decades.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.588
- Yeah, well,
I got ten of my own.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.556
- Was that your choice,
or the department's?

23:45.625 --> 23:47.727
No, I didn't help her
kidnap the kid.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.062
- But you did know
what she wanted to do.

23:51.564 --> 23:54.166
She asked me to help her
get fake passports.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.169
One for her
and one for the kid--

23:57.203 --> 23:58.204
I suspected.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.042
I said I didn't help her.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.544
I still have some scruples.

24:07.514 --> 24:08.648
- No.

24:08.681 --> 24:09.949
- Your man in Boston--

24:09.982 --> 24:11.684
when he was looking
for Ellie Porter,

24:11.718 --> 24:12.985
he must have interviewed
some people

24:13.019 --> 24:14.554
that were in her life.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.890
- Sure.
- Get him on the phone.

24:17.924 --> 24:20.226
I sure hope I wasn't
such a dick

24:20.259 --> 24:23.830
when I was on the job.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.798
- Juan Ortoli, 50 years old,

24:25.832 --> 24:27.233
from Derry, New Hampshire.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.735
He owns a gardening company.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.770
- And he made a $10,000 deposit
two weeks ago.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.171
- Does that seem cheap
for a kidnapping?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.906
- Hold on.
Two weeks ago?

24:33.940 --> 24:36.509
Noah had his first sleepover
at Sheila's two weeks ago.

24:36.543 --> 24:37.944
Juan must have been there.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.079
That's why--that's why Noah
didn't fight back.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.548
- Tried to trace his phone.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.882
No dice.
Must be off.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.651
- I'll have the Derry PD
sit on the house

24:44.684 --> 24:46.853
until you guys get there.
It's about a four-hour drive.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.588
- It's three
if you got a badge.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.224
- And we really
can go fishing?

24:52.258 --> 24:53.660
- Of course we can!

24:53.693 --> 24:54.927
We can do whatever you want.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.029
And wait till you see
the deer and moose.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.666
- No, they stay away.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.768
They're more scared of us
than we are of them.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.572
- Well, we can go for
a walk in the woods tomorrow.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.874
But we have to be
very quiet.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.976
Think you can do that?
I'm sure you can.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.844
- Can we do it again
when Mommy gets here?

25:11.878 --> 25:14.046
She wants to see a deer too.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.948
- Of course we can, baby,

25:15.982 --> 25:17.717
but I can't wait to show you
the cabin!

25:17.750 --> 25:19.085
We've got antlers.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.821
- Really.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.590
- Hey, there.
Rollins, NYPD.

25:23.623 --> 25:24.991
Any sign of Ortoli?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.693
- From what I can tell,
it's just his daughter inside.

25:26.726 --> 25:27.860
It's the light blue one
over there.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.962
- All right.
I appreciate it.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.698
You see anything,
give us a heads-up.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.699
Cell's on there.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.966
- Yeah, you got it.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.705
- I'm sure you've got
the wrong guy.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.239
My dad--he won't toss

25:40.272 --> 25:41.574
his gum wrapper
on the sidewalk.

25:42.675 --> 25:43.976
- At a trade show in Nashua.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.713
- Three days.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.582
Maybe I shouldn't be
saying anything.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.217
- He's not here.
- Just like I said.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.720
- Have you ever met a woman
named Sheila Porter?

25:53.753 --> 25:55.321
- Maybe I'll call
Mitch Carson.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.856
He's a lawyer.

25:56.889 --> 25:57.957
- There's no need,
if you really believe

25:57.990 --> 25:59.191
your father didn't do anything.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.894
*

26:01.928 --> 26:04.230
Dad's been doing
Mrs. Porter's lawn for years.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.865
She's a nice lady.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.767
It's sad,
what happened to Ellie.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.003
*

26:11.037 --> 26:12.171
- Rollins.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.674
*

26:14.707 --> 26:17.744
Is he alone?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.979
Then no, let him come in.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.081
Sit down.
Don't move.

26:22.114 --> 26:29.155
*

26:30.657 --> 26:32.024
- Cops!

26:32.058 --> 26:33.626
Dad, run!

26:36.663 --> 26:37.830
*

26:37.864 --> 26:39.165
- Hold on!
Hold on!

26:39.198 --> 26:41.267
- Stop!
- Get on your knees right now.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.136
- Juan Ortoli, you're under
arrest for kidnapping

26:44.170 --> 26:45.404
and a lot of other stuff.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.973
- Get your hands up!

26:57.349 --> 26:57.717
.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.751
- I needed new equipment,
so I went to a trade show!

27:00.252 --> 27:01.688
- That's right.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.690
- For three days.
- It's a big show.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.091
- Oh, that's funny,
because a guy

27:05.124 --> 27:06.392
who looks exactly like you

27:06.425 --> 27:08.194
was in a mall in New York City
yesterday.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.196
- It wasn't me.
- With a kid who looked exactly

27:10.229 --> 27:11.698
like Mrs. Porter's grandson.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.832
Now explain that to me.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.366
- I didn't even know
she had one.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.335
- It's the truth.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.904
Because if anything

27:17.937 --> 27:19.105
happens to Noah,

27:19.138 --> 27:20.339
if they cross state lines,

27:20.372 --> 27:22.208
you're looking at 20 years,
minimum.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.677
- Dad...

27:24.711 --> 27:26.278
*

27:26.312 --> 27:28.214
- So keep pressing him.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.116
Hey, you're not a cop
in New Hampshire.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.951
Just do it.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.452
- Liv, we got something.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.988
Sheila's sister was
Sara Cummings.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.390
- At the time of her death,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.292
she owned property
in Franconia, New Hampshire.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.994
- I'll call the FBI
and the state police.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.329
- No.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.298
I do not
want to make her desperate.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.801
- There's a flight
from LaGuardia to Manchester

27:48.835 --> 27:51.170
leaving in 90 minutes.
- You're driving.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.741
- Okay, here we go.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.976
- I think it's too big.
- No, no, no.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.477
It's very, very comfy.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.746
Okay?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.413
Now, want to get
good night's sleep,

28:01.447 --> 28:03.282
because we have to
get up early in the morning.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.752
That's when the deer
like to play.

28:05.785 --> 28:06.753
Okay?

28:09.789 --> 28:11.157
- I almost forgot.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.760
*

28:13.793 --> 28:16.062
We can't go anywhere
without Eddie.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.396
Here you go, sweetie.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.865
All right.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.166
Sweet dreams, sweet boy.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.969
*

28:25.471 --> 28:28.140
- When will my mommy
be here?

28:28.174 --> 28:29.742
- Oh, she's at work, Noah,

28:29.776 --> 28:31.210
but she'll be here
as soon as she can.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.212
- Can we call again
in the morning?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.181
- Of course we can, sweet boy.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.116
Now, get some sleep,
and tomorrow,

28:37.149 --> 28:40.519
we'll see the deer.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.454
- Damn it, Juan,
this is not going to end well.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.323
- I got nothing to say.
- And what you don't understand

28:44.356 --> 28:46.392
is that kid you snatched
is my boss' son.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.795
She's a lieutenant in the New
York City Police Department.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.196
- That means we're not
going to take much more

28:50.229 --> 28:52.064
of this crap from you.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.232
Oh, screw it.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.134
- Unh!

28:55.167 --> 28:56.302
- It's her son, Juan!

28:56.335 --> 28:58.037
Imagine somebody took Maria

28:58.070 --> 28:59.171
and did God-knows-what
with her.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.272
What would you do
to get her back?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.340
- That's a good idea.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.209
- Maria Ortoli,

29:03.242 --> 29:05.945
you're under arrest
for conspiracy to kidnap.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.314
- Too bad your old man
is just playing dumb.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.917
- Wait, wait, Maria
doesn't know anything!

29:10.950 --> 29:12.051
- But you do, Juan.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.085
You do!

29:13.119 --> 29:14.821
- I know your boss.

29:14.854 --> 29:16.355
I know she didn't care
about Noah.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.026
- I know she's under
investigation for child abuse!

29:20.059 --> 29:21.227
- That's a crock, Juan.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.561
- I helped Sheila save him!

29:22.594 --> 29:24.496
- She saved him from getting
hit by a car.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.298
That's why he had
the black and blue marks

29:26.332 --> 29:27.834
on his arm.
- I don't believe you.

29:27.867 --> 29:28.835
I believe Sheila.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.238
Now that is interesting,
Juan,

29:32.271 --> 29:34.974
because the guy who cuts
my mom's lawn

29:35.007 --> 29:37.343
calls her Mrs. Carisi.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978
- I've been working for Sheila
for 14 years.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.112
- So that's it, Juan.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.313
You're doing a little more

29:41.347 --> 29:42.882
than cutting Miss Porter's
lawn, eh?

29:44.016 --> 29:45.151
- The right thing.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.253
- You stupid old fool.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.988
You're gonna go to jail
for that bitch?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.589
- She said--

29:50.622 --> 29:54.293
She's gonna pay you a million
dollars that she doesn't have?

29:54.326 --> 29:56.395
- Do you know what it's like
for me?

29:56.428 --> 29:59.431
Since your mama died?

29:59.465 --> 30:02.001
Sheila talked to me
like I was a real person.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.235
- She was using you, Juan.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.571
- I took the test!
I'm an American!

30:05.604 --> 30:08.207
But she's the only one
that treats me like I'm human.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.910
Where is she?

30:10.943 --> 30:12.278
- I was gonna save the boy

30:12.311 --> 30:13.512
and we was--we were
gonna go be family!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.548
- Tell them, damn it!

30:16.582 --> 30:18.250
Your daughter's going away
for a very long time.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.251
- Tell them, please!

30:19.285 --> 30:20.319
- She's in Montreal!

30:20.352 --> 30:22.021
Right now?

30:22.054 --> 30:24.423
- No, I was going to meet her
in a few days

30:24.456 --> 30:25.557
and we were going
to go up together.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.900
- She's...

30:33.933 --> 30:36.435
She's in my cabin!

30:36.468 --> 30:37.970
- All right,
you're coming with us.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.171
You're gonna show us the way.

30:39.205 --> 30:44.076
*

30:51.150 --> 30:58.357
*

31:07.266 --> 31:14.273
*

31:14.640 --> 31:16.608
- You are gonna sit,
you are gonna wait,

31:16.642 --> 31:19.211
and you are gonna pray
that that kid isn't hurt.

31:19.245 --> 31:26.418
*

31:45.537 --> 31:47.273
There's no food here.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.675
There's nothing here.
That son of a bitch lied to us.

31:49.708 --> 31:53.980
*

31:56.115 --> 31:57.449
Where the hell is she?

31:57.483 --> 31:58.717
- She's there!
- No, she's not.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.186
Nobody's been in there
for a while.

32:00.219 --> 32:01.387
- But she said

32:01.420 --> 32:02.454
we would meet at my cabin.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.323
I gave her my keys.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.258
- Well, you've been played,
Juan.

32:06.292 --> 32:13.499
*

32:55.407 --> 33:02.614
*

33:09.188 --> 33:09.321
.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.089
- I wasn't gonna hurt you,
Sheila.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.491
- Cut the crap.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.761
You were coming
to take my baby.

33:15.794 --> 33:19.298
- He's not your baby.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.667
- We'll see.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.739
He's sleeping.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.508
- I just want to see him.
- No.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.677
No.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.380
- I'm his mother, Sheila.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.085
'Cause a judge
signed a piece of paper?

33:42.121 --> 33:44.156
That doesn't make you
his mother.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.558
- Actually--

33:46.592 --> 33:48.394
actually, Sheila, it does.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.429
- No, he is my blood.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.598
He is my family.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.433
*

33:54.466 --> 33:56.735
He will never
be a part of you

33:56.768 --> 33:58.570
the way he is
a part of me.

33:58.604 --> 34:01.473
*

34:01.507 --> 34:04.743
- Blood isn't the only thing
that makes families, Sheila.

34:04.776 --> 34:12.184
*

34:15.287 --> 34:18.390
Legally...

34:18.424 --> 34:21.293
Noah is my son.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.295
*

34:23.329 --> 34:24.596
- The law says

34:24.630 --> 34:27.199
that I would have
received notice.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.368
If you followed the law,
we wouldn't even be here.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.171
- Sheila...

34:32.204 --> 34:33.739
Sheila...

34:33.772 --> 34:36.508
I am the only mother

34:36.542 --> 34:37.709
that he knows.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.612
*

34:40.646 --> 34:42.314
Sheila...

34:42.348 --> 34:43.615
Listen to me.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.751
*

34:45.784 --> 34:47.719
Have you--have you
thought about...

34:47.753 --> 34:50.222
*

34:50.256 --> 34:52.858
Do you realize
what this would do to him?

34:52.891 --> 34:54.893
- He--he is a smart boy.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.430
He'll adapt, and this is
a much better place for him.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.633
There's fresh air.
He can play in the woods.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.835
This is how you raise a boy.

35:03.869 --> 35:07.239
Better than that filthy,
dirty city.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.608
And you?

35:09.641 --> 35:12.678
You're at work
all the time.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.146
I will be here for him.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.781
- I am  here for him.

35:15.814 --> 35:21.653
*

35:21.687 --> 35:23.789
Come on, Sheila.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.657
You know me.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.327
*

35:28.360 --> 35:31.530
I won't let that happen.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.200
*

35:34.233 --> 35:36.368
- I'm not a bad person,
Olivia.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.470
*

35:38.504 --> 35:40.472
I'm trying to let you go.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.543
*

35:44.576 --> 35:45.711
- I can't do that.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.680
You can just get another

35:48.714 --> 35:50.749
little baby.
You--

35:50.782 --> 35:52.951
You can sign
another piece of paper.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.887
You can adopt
another little boy,

35:55.921 --> 35:59.525
a little boy
who needs a family.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.493
You don't know
what this means.

36:01.527 --> 36:04.596
*

36:04.630 --> 36:06.698
You--you can never know.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.700
*

36:08.734 --> 36:11.670
- You're not his mother,
Sheila.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.441
- Mommy!

36:15.474 --> 36:16.908
- Noah.
- Oh.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.877
- Come here.
- Mommy, you made it!

36:18.910 --> 36:21.847
- Uh.. Oh.. Hey, baby.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.349
Hey, Noah.

36:23.382 --> 36:24.783
Hey, baby.
- Noah, we're gonna go now.

36:24.816 --> 36:25.851
- Do you wanna go
see the deer?

36:25.884 --> 36:27.719
- Mommy, come with us.

36:27.753 --> 36:29.421
- Get out the door.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.457
- You can't leave!
- Back off!

36:32.724 --> 36:34.460
- No!

36:34.493 --> 36:36.595
No! No!

36:36.628 --> 36:37.896
He is mine!

36:37.929 --> 36:40.466
He is my baby boy!

36:40.499 --> 36:42.701
You can't have him!
You can't have him!

36:42.734 --> 36:43.902
He's all I have left!

36:43.935 --> 36:45.904
He's all I have left.

36:45.937 --> 36:47.539
He's... He's...

36:47.573 --> 36:48.774
He's...

36:48.807 --> 36:51.610
- Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.445
- I love him.
- I know.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.714
- I love him.
- Shh, I know you do.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.949
Sh...

37:03.989 --> 37:11.397
*

37:14.933 --> 37:22.308
*

37:27.413 --> 37:30.516
- Wait, wait, what's going
to happen to me?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.318
- We're going to take you
to a local precinct

37:32.351 --> 37:35.721
and then arrange
for your extradition.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.823
- I'm so sorry, Olivia.

37:37.856 --> 37:44.029
*

37:44.062 --> 37:47.399
- Watch your feet.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.503
- Ah, just a little shaken up.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.575
- He's hopefully
better than I am.

37:56.608 --> 38:00.446
Give me a minute.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.723
- Well, I am about ready
to go home.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.058
How about you?

38:13.091 --> 38:14.860
- You and Grandma Sheila
were fighting.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.962
- Yes, Noah, we were fighting.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.065
*

38:20.098 --> 38:23.902
- Noah, Grandma Sheila
is a good person

38:23.935 --> 38:25.937
who...

38:25.971 --> 38:28.574
who did a really bad thing.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.709
Can you understand that?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.747
- I hope so.

38:35.781 --> 38:38.784
But you know what?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.852
- Aunt Amanda
and Uncle Sonny

38:40.886 --> 38:44.122
are gonna drive us home,
and I'll bet

38:44.155 --> 38:46.858
that we can go get pancakes
if you like.

38:46.892 --> 38:51.863
*

38:51.897 --> 38:53.499
I love you...

38:53.532 --> 38:55.133
*

38:55.166 --> 38:56.668
So much.

38:56.702 --> 39:00.839
*

39:00.872 --> 39:02.574
So much.

39:02.608 --> 39:05.511
*

39:05.544 --> 39:07.379
Let's go.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.582
Come on.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.855
- Nobody's home.

39:18.724 --> 39:21.993
- Probably enjoying
a little time off.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.762
- I heard they found her son.

39:23.795 --> 39:26.498
- Yeah, turns out he was
on a little road trip

39:26.532 --> 39:27.433
with grandma.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.735
- And I can assume
she followed my order

39:29.768 --> 39:31.069
to stay away from this case?

39:31.102 --> 39:32.938
- Last thing I heard,
she was at home,

39:32.971 --> 39:34.873
waiting by the phone.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.677
- You be right on that.

39:41.913 --> 39:45.517
- Well, I'm glad you're on
our side, Detective Tutuola.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.686
- Count your blessings,
Chief.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.694
Dick.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.801
- Hey.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.936
How you doing?

40:04.970 --> 40:09.140
- You know, I honestly
don't know how to answer that.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.942
I stay up all night
watching him.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.144
If I hear a sound, I'm up.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.213
We went to the,
uh, corner fruit stand

40:15.246 --> 40:17.015
and this woman said that
Noah was cute,

40:17.048 --> 40:20.552
and I practically
bit her head off.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.954
But you didn't come over
to, uh,

40:22.988 --> 40:25.591
listen to me talk about that.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.992
- I came here to talk
to my friend about

40:27.025 --> 40:30.729
whatever she wants
to talk about.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.565
She gonna ask me in?

40:33.599 --> 40:35.767
- Of course.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.070
Hey.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.472
- Hi, Uncle Rafa!

40:40.506 --> 40:41.139
- Hi!

40:41.172 --> 40:42.574
- Tell him about the deer.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.710
- We saw a mommy deer
and her baby

40:44.743 --> 40:46.011
when we were driving home.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.746
They ran right in front of us.
