The brave warriors of Earth

00:38.517 --> 00:41.655
under the command of General
Major Webelo Zapp Brannigan

00:41.723 --> 00:45.000
have achieved victory
over the Spider home-world.

00:48.723 --> 00:51.792
And to the victor
belong the spoils.

00:51.862 --> 00:55.517
One trillion dollars
in silken treasure.

00:55.585 --> 00:57.792
Mm.

00:57.862 --> 00:59.758
My fellow Earthicans

00:59.826 --> 01:02.000
after meeting with top
voodoo economists

01:02.067 --> 01:04.688
I have decided to refund
our silk surplus

01:04.757 --> 01:06.412
to you, the taxpayers.

01:06.481 --> 01:10.240
That's right.
I've sent you each 300 buckaroos

01:10.310 --> 01:12.516
in the form of
a Tricky Dick fun bill.

01:12.585 --> 01:14.620
Knock yourselves out.

01:15.757 --> 01:17.000
[ excited murmuring]

01:17.067 --> 01:18.655
I'm slightly richer.

01:18.724 --> 01:20.448
What to do? What to do?

01:20.516 --> 01:24.379
One $300 hookerbot
or 300 one-dollar hookerbots?

01:24.448 --> 01:25.861
I'm going to swim
with a whale.

01:25.930 --> 01:28.033
They're the gentle
giants of the deep.

01:28.103 --> 01:29.793
I'm well aware of that.

01:29.861 --> 01:33.171
Scruffy's going to get himself
one of them $300 haircuts.

01:33.240 --> 01:36.343
This one's lost it's pizzazz.

01:36.412 --> 01:37.758
A fortune, it is.

01:37.826 --> 01:41.758
At last, Zoidberg
will live like a rich man.

01:41.826 --> 01:43.378

01:43.448 --> 01:44.585
Go away.
Get away from me.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.033
Shmeesh.
It's just 300 bucks.

01:47.103 --> 01:49.206
What is that, like,
a hundred cups of coffee?

01:49.275 --> 01:50.412
That's it!

01:50.481 --> 01:51.930
I'm getting a hundred
cups of coffee

01:52.000 --> 01:53.412
starting now.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.930

02:04.655 --> 02:06.965
Leela, are you there?

02:07.034 --> 02:07.757
No.

02:07.826 --> 02:09.343
Oh, yes, you are.

02:09.413 --> 02:11.931
I'm hereby inviting you
and your oddball coworkers

02:12.000 --> 02:13.343
to a special reception

02:13.413 --> 02:16.171
to display the national
silk surplus.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.620
I believe you know the heroic
space stallion who captured it.

02:19.688 --> 02:21.516
Show them my medal, Kif.

02:21.586 --> 02:24.413
[ sighs]:
He rented it with
his tax refund.

02:24.481 --> 02:27.655
So, Leela, will you
have the pleasure?

02:27.723 --> 02:29.688
What little there is to be had.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.171
Tomorrow night at 8:00 then.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.481
Smooches.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.103
No cheap crack houses
for me no more.

02:45.550 --> 02:46.688
Very good, sir.

02:46.758 --> 02:49.793
Shall I prewarm
sir's crack pipe?

02:51.861 --> 02:54.275
[ panting]

02:54.343 --> 02:56.516
Oh, Kif

02:56.586 --> 02:59.067
it was so romantic of you
to rent this paddle plane

02:59.137 --> 03:00.413
with your tax rebate.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.137
We're like two
dandelion seeds

03:02.205 --> 03:03.516
wafting on the breeze.

03:03.586 --> 03:05.205
[ panting]:
Yes. Seeds.

03:05.275 --> 03:06.861
Wafting.

03:06.931 --> 03:08.240
I almost feel
kind of shallow

03:08.310 --> 03:09.310
for blowing my rebate

03:09.378 --> 03:10.965
on this cool
talking tattoo.

03:11.033 --> 03:12.481
Hey, Gordon Gecko.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.655
I cost as much as this
whole crummy date.

03:14.723 --> 03:15.896
Shut up!

03:15.965 --> 03:16.931
Ow!

03:20.758 --> 03:23.655
Ma'am, it has become
too much of a chore

03:23.723 --> 03:26.103
for me to clean out
my wrinkles each day.

03:26.171 --> 03:29.861
Is it true that stem cells
may fight the aging process?

03:29.931 --> 03:31.655
Well, yes, in the same way

03:31.723 --> 03:33.620
an infant may fight
Muhammad Ali, but...

03:33.688 --> 03:36.240
One pound of stem cells please.

03:38.896 --> 03:40.655
Of course, any
age-reversing effects

03:40.723 --> 03:43.067
will be purely temporary...

Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho.

04:02.758 --> 04:06.068
Say, buddy, why is this
Grand Cigar so pricey?

04:06.137 --> 04:07.758
Well, as you can see

04:07.826 --> 04:11.413
its wrapper is a
piece of the original
U.S. Constitution.

04:11.481 --> 04:15.448
It was hand-rolled
by Queen Elizabeth
during her wild years

04:15.516 --> 04:17.654
and was buried
with George Burns

04:17.723 --> 04:20.343
until grave-robbing
space mushrooms...

04:20.413 --> 04:21.896
Well, you know
the rest.

04:21.964 --> 04:23.516
Give you 300 bucks for it.

04:23.586 --> 04:26.240
No can do.
Oh, all right.

04:26.310 --> 04:29.550
I'll just take these
$300 burglar's tools then.

04:32.067 --> 04:35.137
So, uh, what time
you close tonight?

04:37.172 --> 04:39.274
Hey, Pops.
Did that tax rebate come?

04:39.343 --> 04:40.723
Came and went.

04:40.793 --> 04:44.137
You're now the proud owner
of Bamboo Boogie Boots.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.723
With a warning label this big

04:46.793 --> 04:48.343
you know they got to be fun.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.343
But, Pops, I don't want
to have fun.

04:50.413 --> 04:53.447
I want to be like you--
boring, but prudently invested.

04:53.516 --> 04:54.930
Babylon's bells!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.033
I tallied
almost 300 bananas

04:57.103 --> 04:58.343
on this entertainment
product.

04:58.413 --> 05:00.103
Now you put them on
and have fun.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.310
I don't wanna!

05:01.379 --> 05:02.930
Well, then I'm gonna
put them on

05:03.000 --> 05:04.310
and make you
watch me have fun.

the right guy.

I'm the whale biologist.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.447
Though, personally,
I hate whales.

06:04.516 --> 06:06.274
[ sotto voce]:
Especially Mushu.

06:06.343 --> 06:08.516
Then why'd you become
a whale biologist?

to get into that.

smoke it already?

11:20.620 --> 11:22.067
Puff, puff.
Go, go, go, go, go!

11:22.136 --> 11:25.309
Nah, you can't blow a smoke
from such a majestic stogie

11:25.379 --> 11:26.724
in just anyone's face.

11:26.793 --> 11:28.447
I'm saving it
for the fancy pantsies

11:28.517 --> 11:30.517
at Zapp Brannigan's
black-tie reception.

11:30.586 --> 11:31.620
You coming?

11:31.688 --> 11:35.033
[ juddering]

11:37.136 --> 11:38.895
And the fifth reason whales kill

11:38.965 --> 11:40.447
is for the sheer fun of it.

11:40.517 --> 11:41.551
Anything else?

11:41.620 --> 11:43.379
Yeah-- you're lumpy
and you smell awful.

11:43.447 --> 11:44.413
Hey.

11:44.481 --> 11:45.931
I calls them like I sees them.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.309
I'm a whale biologist.

11:48.931 --> 11:52.620
Okay, Mushu, it's feeding time.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.965
[ chomping]

12:00.240 --> 12:01.517
[ gasps]

12:01.586 --> 12:04.724
Oh, crud, he ate my suit.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.067
The suit was ugly.

12:06.136 --> 12:07.413
Whale biologist.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.758
[ grunts]

12:14.447 --> 12:15.654
[ groans]

12:15.724 --> 12:17.826
Perhaps if you tighten
your grip, sir.

12:17.895 --> 12:20.931
Ah, thank you, golf slave.

12:22.379 --> 12:25.067
Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste
their time on this nonsense.

12:25.136 --> 12:27.379
Plus, these eggs
are gritty and tasteless.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.586
[ spitting]

12:30.931 --> 12:33.724
[ erotic moaning]

12:33.793 --> 12:34.654
Ow!

12:34.724 --> 12:36.240
Not so rough!

12:40.551 --> 12:43.206
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting Mushu

12:43.274 --> 12:47.274
the educated whale
who thinks he's better than you.

12:47.344 --> 12:48.965
[ applause]

12:49.033 --> 12:51.517
Come on, Mushu, barf!

12:51.586 --> 12:53.413
Barf like a freshman!

12:53.481 --> 12:55.413
And now,
ignorant whale lovers

12:55.481 --> 12:56.758
we'll see who's boss

12:56.826 --> 12:59.309
as I make Mushu
jump through this hoop.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.826
Jump, Mushu.

13:02.551 --> 13:05.447
[ gagging and coughing]

13:05.517 --> 13:07.586
MAN:
Who wants a fish?

13:14.517 --> 13:16.586
Mushu is sad.

13:16.654 --> 13:19.447
It just keeps
coming and coming.

13:19.517 --> 13:21.688
[ humming]

13:22.965 --> 13:24.826
Wait... that chunk!

13:24.895 --> 13:26.654
It's the watch.

13:27.965 --> 13:30.895
[ cheering]

13:30.965 --> 13:32.517
I got it, Amy, I got it.

13:32.586 --> 13:34.551
The plan went off without a...

13:34.620 --> 13:35.861
He's got aquarium property!

13:35.931 --> 13:36.861
Stop him!

13:36.931 --> 13:38.413
Better do
what he says!

13:38.481 --> 13:40.000
He's a whale
biologist.

13:41.826 --> 13:43.274
You're under arrest,
you squishy punk!

13:43.344 --> 13:44.344
Oh...

13:44.413 --> 13:45.793
[ glass shattering]

13:45.861 --> 13:46.895
Oh.

13:46.965 --> 13:48.000
[ choking sound]

13:48.067 --> 13:50.000
[ retching]

13:58.758 --> 14:00.206
[ screaming]

14:00.274 --> 14:01.758
ZAPP:
The Spiderians--

14:01.826 --> 14:04.447
though weak and womanlike
on the battlefield--

14:04.517 --> 14:06.309
are masters
of the textile arts.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.240
Taste like King Crab,
by the way.

14:08.309 --> 14:11.136
Crazy bugs actually
wove this tapestry

14:11.206 --> 14:12.826
of my heroic conquest

14:12.895 --> 14:15.206
while I was still
killing them.

14:16.895 --> 14:18.067
[ sniffing]

14:18.136 --> 14:20.309
What? It's not even
scratch-and-sniff?

14:20.379 --> 14:23.413
But if rich people
think it's good, I'll buy it.

14:23.481 --> 14:25.136
One art, please.

14:25.206 --> 14:27.136
[ laughing]

14:27.206 --> 14:30.413
What a clever impersonation
of a stupid poor person!

14:30.481 --> 14:33.931
How much is that place mat
actually worth, Brannigan?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.274
Exactly $1 billion.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.724
Now that'swalkin' around money.

14:42.344 --> 14:43.413
[ blowing nose]

14:43.481 --> 14:44.724
NIXON:
What? Hey? [ howls]

14:56.724 --> 14:58.517
[ bell dings]

14:58.586 --> 15:00.102
So I said to Kitty

15:00.172 --> 15:03.551
the only way to
keep the butler
from running away

15:03.620 --> 15:05.274
is to cut off
his foot.

15:05.344 --> 15:06.274
Ah... ha-ha.

15:06.344 --> 15:07.481
Uh-huh.

15:07.551 --> 15:09.724
Yes, it reminds me
of a joke I heard

15:09.793 --> 15:11.758
about upper
middle-class people.

15:11.826 --> 15:13.309
[ coughing]

15:16.517 --> 15:19.688
[ sobbing]:
I've never been sad
at a party before.

15:19.758 --> 15:21.688
I wonder if my
mind is thinking

15:21.758 --> 15:23.379
about Kif being in jail.

15:23.447 --> 15:24.551
Jail's not so bad.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.620
You can make sangria
in the toilet.

15:26.688 --> 15:28.551
Course, it's shank
or be shanked.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.620
Of course.

15:32.551 --> 15:34.654
Look, just give
back our property

15:34.724 --> 15:36.447
and we'll drop
the charges.

15:36.517 --> 15:38.067
Fine! Have the watch!

15:38.136 --> 15:39.344
It's broken anyway.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.586
I don't want your watch!

15:42.654 --> 15:44.826
You're covered in
precious ambergris.

15:44.895 --> 15:47.447
Precious hamburgers?

15:49.586 --> 15:51.965
"Ambergris." Noun.

15:52.033 --> 15:55.654
A grease-like product of the
sperm whale's digestive tract

15:55.724 --> 15:58.586
that is used as a base
in the finest perfumes.

15:58.654 --> 16:00.758
This has been Roseanne

16:00.826 --> 16:03.586
your guide
to the world of facts.

16:03.654 --> 16:04.826
You heard Roseanne.

16:04.895 --> 16:06.517
Scrape off the
priceless ambergris

16:06.586 --> 16:07.931
and I'll let you go.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.965
Or-Or better yet,
I'll simply shed my skin.

16:12.033 --> 16:13.688
[ grunting]

16:18.309 --> 16:19.309
Stop it. Stop it.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.309
It's fine!

16:20.379 --> 16:21.861
I will destroy you!

16:23.861 --> 16:25.688
[ both coughing]

16:25.758 --> 16:29.413
[ lustful moaning]

16:30.724 --> 16:32.033
[ bell chimes]Wha...?

16:32.102 --> 16:34.413
[ creaking]

16:39.620 --> 16:40.551
Uh, got to go.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.344
Uh, fight club.

16:46.688 --> 16:48.793
What's happening, Hubie?

16:48.861 --> 16:51.826
Ah, I'm afraid the face
you fell in love with

16:51.895 --> 16:54.413
was actually just
a blob of living gunk

16:54.481 --> 16:56.274
I bought with my tax refund.

16:56.344 --> 17:00.000
[ gurgling]

17:00.067 --> 17:03.172
Well, as long as
we're being honest

17:03.240 --> 17:07.309
I also spent my tax refund
on a crazy treatment.

17:07.378 --> 17:10.205
[ pops]

17:10.275 --> 17:12.413
That certainly is honest.

17:12.481 --> 17:15.862
It's better for us to both
just be ourselves.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.619
You, wrinkled
as a prune.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.448
You, fat as
the queen of sea cows.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.654
I love you!

17:22.723 --> 17:24.931
[ moaning]

17:28.136 --> 17:30.275
So, you see,
the putrid, waxy substance

17:30.344 --> 17:31.689
I was coated with was...

17:31.758 --> 17:33.586
Not precious ambergris?

17:33.654 --> 17:36.309
Yes. And I managed
to sneak some out

17:36.378 --> 17:37.792
in the usual place.

17:37.862 --> 17:39.413
Ta-da!

17:39.481 --> 17:44.136
Using that, I'll make you
a perfume of lilac and jasmine

17:44.205 --> 17:45.413
and frankenberry.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.619
Oh, Kif, it's so romantic.

17:47.689 --> 17:49.136
I can't even wait!

17:49.205 --> 17:51.931
I'm going to wear it right now.

Who smells like
freaking porpoise hork?

18:00.136 --> 18:02.586
I do. Kiss me, Kif.

18:10.275 --> 18:13.172
Oh, what a foolish squid
I've been.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.344
I'm not rich.

18:14.413 --> 18:16.826
I can't even buy
one measly masterpiece.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.378
[ sobbing]

18:21.240 --> 18:22.448
Pardon us, gent.

18:22.517 --> 18:24.964
Might a couple of
hungry, hungry hoboes

18:25.034 --> 18:27.792
take a feed from that
aluminum snack box?

18:28.895 --> 18:30.550
So now I'm in the gutter

18:30.619 --> 18:32.964
surrounded by bums
who eat garbage?

18:33.034 --> 18:35.136
Money brought me no happiness.

18:35.205 --> 18:36.550
Bupkes.

18:36.619 --> 18:40.136
Ooh, this boot's got
a little pudding at the bottom.

18:40.205 --> 18:41.826
[ with lisp]:
Interestingly

18:41.895 --> 18:44.103
the Spiderians are
more closely related

18:44.172 --> 18:47.481
to our elephants
than our spiders.

20:33.481 --> 20:34.758

to the food?

I think we were saved
by a mysterious orange blur.

Welcome,
one and all.

20:40.344 --> 20:43.964
I finally figured out
how money could make me happy--

20:44.034 --> 20:46.862
by using it to buy
my hungry friends a feast!

Heck, you're never too rich
to enjoy a free turkey dog.

20:58.172 --> 20:59.931
Yeah, I'm starved!All right!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.517
I'll take four.
Me, too.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.240
Oh, what the hell.

Here, Dwight.

The boots only
cost $299.99.

You invest this penny

21:16.689 --> 21:18.205
Thanks, Dad.

21:18.275 --> 21:20.826
I'm going to take this and buy
five shares of Amazon.com.

That's my boy.

Oh, what a McGovern I've been.

21:28.103 --> 21:31.654
Why did I have to issue
that crooked tax rebate?

21:31.723 --> 21:35.619
Uh, at least we got a few mildly
interesting stories out of it.

21:35.689 --> 21:37.240
Oh, my, yes.

Speaking of which,
