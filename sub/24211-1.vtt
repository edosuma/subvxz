WEBVTT

00:10.440 --> 00:11.760
Attention all units...

00:17.040 --> 00:18.720
Searching the living room...

00:39.760 --> 00:41.240
Searching the top floor.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.360
The west room seems to be a classroom.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.920
There are desks and a whiteboard.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.280
No human presence.

00:57.000 --> 00:57.840
ROYAL MINT (CAMERAS)

01:00.400 --> 01:01.800
DIRECTOR
CHRONICLERS - STAFF (SHIFTS)

01:08.480 --> 01:09.400
Inspector,

01:09.480 --> 01:10.720
there is something else.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.200
I only want forensics in there.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.320
You got it.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.520
Inspector.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.720
The kitchen and bathroom
are full of remains.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.000
Come with me.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.520
What's that?

01:43.440 --> 01:44.600
Looks like fish.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.680
Anchovies.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.480
Inspector, the purchase records they stole
at the pharmacy in Palomeque.

01:55.440 --> 01:56.520
They were in a drawer.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
Damn.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.800
The person that helps them was here.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.960
Less than 30 hours ago.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.480
Put surveillance on all adjoining roads.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.200
Attention, cut all roads
within a ten kilometer radius.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.800
Suspect may be near, I repeat,
suspect may be near.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.360
Roger. Units on their way,
informing Traffic Control.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.880
The inspector started secreting
adrenaline and cortisol.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.160
Her heart rate
and blood pressure increased.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.280
Like a lioness,
moments before hunting a gazelle.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.320
She was excited
as she felt her prey closer and closer.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.240
POLICE INVESTIGATE BANK HEIST

02:48.320 --> 02:50.680
COLONEL PRIETO,
DEPUTY INSPECTOR ÁNGEL RUBIO

02:52.400 --> 02:54.520
We have eight different sets of prints.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.000
We have a match for one.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.400
They belong to Silene Oliveira,
known as Tokyo.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.920
Raquel couldn't help but wonder

03:08.000 --> 03:10.280
if those clues were actual leads

03:12.400 --> 03:14.360
or another dead end.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.120
This doesn't make any sense.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.280
Raquel was right.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.720
The Professor had meticulously planned

04:00.800 --> 04:02.320
to lead the police to Toledo,

04:02.560 --> 04:06.040
leaving an Oscar-worthy crime scene,

04:06.800 --> 04:09.880
littered with DNA from people
unrelated to the robbery.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.240
What wasn't in his plans
was returning

04:13.320 --> 04:16.600
to plant the prints of the ones
the police had already identified.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.320
Berlin, Rio...

04:19.400 --> 04:20.320
And me.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.720
Also, throwing them off with
anchovies and the pharmacy records.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.880
He intended to lead Murillo to a dead end

04:28.960 --> 04:30.640
that would make her waste three days.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.560
Three very productive days for us.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.200
Since money prints
at eight million bills per hour.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.600
Especially with the help of the hostages.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.480
Come on, girls.
I need this counted in half hour, okay?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.160
What's up with you? Wake up.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.080
Look, everyone else is smiling.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.800
Let's get to work!
Work brings you dignity, damn it!

05:01.200 --> 05:05.000
Made into accomplices,
they hoped to one day receive

05:05.280 --> 05:06.760
a million euros by mail.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.520
You are coming with me!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.320
Something didn't add up.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.600
Between those walls there was nothing
they didn’t already know.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.560
The Professor thought
it would take her three days,

05:27.720 --> 05:29.920
but it took the inspector 50 minutes.

05:30.040 --> 05:30.920
Suarez.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.640
Call Alberto, get him over here quick.

05:33.720 --> 05:36.160
Alberto, your ex-husband?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.120
He's the best forensic inspector.
Call him.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.920
Attention, headquarters. Operating unit

05:46.000 --> 05:47.400
three one five, Toledo estate.

05:47.560 --> 05:51.120
Inspector Murillo requesting the presence
of Inspector Vicuña at forensics.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.680
Raquel, it's Julia, Paula's teacher.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.280
Just to let you know that Paula's father
picked her up from school at lunch.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.440
He said it was a family event.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.360
I'd like to meet with you,

07:41.520 --> 07:43.840
not regarding Paula,
she's doing well.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.160
But her father wants to go out
with me after class and...

07:47.520 --> 07:50.280
I'm not quite sure how to deal with it.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.640
-You can't be here.
-I know the inspector.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.280
-Who?
-Raquel.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.640
-Salva.
-I'm sorry, I just wanted to say goodbye.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.600
-I apologize for this mess.
-No. You're working, don't worry.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.320
It's okay.
I'll take the road we came in on.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.240
The village will have a bus
to Madrid.

08:26.320 --> 08:27.960
Wait. Suarez.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.720
Is there any car going to Madrid now?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.640
The first load of evidence leaves
for Canillas in a half hour.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.160
I don't want to trouble you.
I'll catch a bus.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.160
The main road is straight down here
and to the right.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.120
-I saw a bus stop.
-Yes, there's one...

08:42.200 --> 08:44.800
Salva, it's no problem.
We will give you a ride.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.320
Okay.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.000
HOUR 80 OF THE HEIST

09:21.480 --> 09:22.360
It's time.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.240
We still have one minute until six.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.440
Well, given the circumstances,

09:29.280 --> 09:32.680
you can take your punctuality
and shove it.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.240
Third call with no answer.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.480
That's 18 hours with no news
from the Professor.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.440
We know what that means.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.640
CHECK-UPS
CYCLES - PROTOCOL

10:15.720 --> 10:18.160
We'll do check-up calls every six hours.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.160
What if you don't call us?

10:20.360 --> 10:22.320
Or if you don’t answer the phone?

10:23.400 --> 10:26.120
Well, if anything comes up,

10:26.760 --> 10:30.200
you wait for the next call,
until we complete a four-call cycle.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.600
Twenty four hours.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.520
And if we haven't made contact with you
in 24 hours?

10:37.400 --> 10:39.880
Then, it will almost certainly mean

10:40.480 --> 10:42.920
that I've been arrested and interrogated.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.120
We don't know anything
about the police either.

10:55.720 --> 10:58.400
I'm sure something is going on outside.
What do we do?

11:00.760 --> 11:01.680
Well,

11:02.880 --> 11:06.040
we still have one call left
to complete the cycle.

11:06.240 --> 11:07.120
At 12:00 am.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.640
What cycle?

11:09.080 --> 11:11.840
-The fucking mousetrap cycle?
-Denver, relax.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.880
The Professor must be tying up
some loose ends.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.960
There's nothing to worry about. Yet.

11:21.080 --> 11:25.040
For now, we keep watching the hostages
and printing money as usual.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.880
-I'm going to rest up.
-Are you kidding?

11:34.800 --> 11:37.240
We're stuck in this mess
and you're going to go fuck?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.080
Tokyo, please.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.120
-What?
-There's no need to be vulgar.

11:43.360 --> 11:46.200
First of all, it doesn't suit you.
Second,

11:47.760 --> 11:52.400
if I had to choose one of you as
a partner, hedonistically speaking,

11:53.640 --> 11:54.760
it would be you.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.240
What happened to carpe diem?

11:59.400 --> 12:02.800
The plan fell to fucking pieces,
is what happened.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.600
And maybe you don't care

12:05.880 --> 12:08.760
because you're terminally ill, but I do.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.000
I'm leaving.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.440
Son of a bitch.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.880
-Another one.
-You are actually fucking a hostage.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.080
Which one? That poor girl

12:20.400 --> 12:23.040
that you have running around
like a fucking errand girl?

12:23.120 --> 12:26.000
Not "poor girl".
Her name is Ariadna, Nairobi.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.200
And yes, we get along.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.000
The day we got here,
Ariadna was shaking

12:34.000 --> 12:35.840
in a way that I recognized. Her...

12:36.320 --> 12:38.800
fragility, her gentleness
awoke something in me.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.080
What a load of crap!

12:41.320 --> 12:44.400
There is nothing more despicable
than fucking a hostage.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.880
Being with a hostage
isn't that bad either, is it?

12:51.800 --> 12:52.680
What's the matter?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.520
You can accuse me of being
good or bad at fucking,

12:55.600 --> 12:57.320
but never of fucking at gunpoint.

12:59.720 --> 13:00.640
Denver.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.560
No.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.040
So what?
Yes, I'm in a relationship too.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.960
With Monica Gaztambide.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.080
-What are you saying, son?
-I saved her life.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.240
And she hugged me and kissed me.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.560
I didn't force her into anything.
It was love.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
What do you mean "love"? You idiot!

13:21.480 --> 13:25.720
-Don't you know about Stockholm syndrome?
-No, Nairobi. I guess I don't.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.080
But if she has a syndrome or illness
we'll get over it together.

13:29.160 --> 13:32.800
No! You won't because
it's you who is causing it!

13:33.240 --> 13:38.000
Stockholm syndrome is when the hostage
develops feelings for the kidnapper.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.120
She's scared as hell!

13:41.800 --> 13:44.960
But you're fucking ignorant
and you think it's love.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.600
What is wrong with you?

13:46.680 --> 13:48.720
-What is wrong with you all?
-Enough!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.760
We are not exactly Nobel Prize winners.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.360
We have to stop bickering
amongst ourselves.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.600
We're in a critical situation.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.920
No, we will be if the Professor doesn't
call in six hours.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.280
Then we'd put Plan Chernobyl into action.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.640
The Professor didn’t say anything
about that.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.200
What's Plan Chernobyl?

14:19.520 --> 14:21.920
If all goes well, you'll never find out.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.200
So, please, let's be patient.

14:27.640 --> 14:28.480
Okay?

14:29.120 --> 14:32.600
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to clear my head.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.000
Salva,
do you think I should drop the case?

14:51.800 --> 14:54.440
Like, say that I'm not well
and take leave.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.080
Give up.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.000
That's a very personal question.

15:00.520 --> 15:01.800
That's why I'm asking you.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.000
We've slept together.
You've already met my mother.

15:08.560 --> 15:12.200
I mean that it's a question
only you can answer.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.040
Only you know how you feel about it.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.880
I feel that this is too much for me.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.320
If someone else was in my place...

15:23.400 --> 15:24.560
Don't do that, Raquel.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.320
If you're at the head of a case like this,

15:28.280 --> 15:30.960
it's because there's nobody better
than you to manage it.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.120
I don’t know. In the tent...

15:34.040 --> 15:37.440
When I spoke with that guy,
the Professor who I negotiated with,

15:38.960 --> 15:39.880
I felt useful.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.760
Even if I had to answer questions like

15:44.280 --> 15:47.240
-"What are you wearing?"
-"What are you wearing?"

15:48.960 --> 15:52.720
But, I don’t know.
Here on the field, I feel like...

15:54.200 --> 15:56.440
Like he's stronger than me,
I can't beat him.

15:57.640 --> 15:58.760
I don't know. Look.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.400
All those people working.
Thirty guys from forensics.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.920
I don't know which way to go.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.520
I feel lost.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.960
I'm sorry, Salva.
It must be getting late for you.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.480
No.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.320
Not at all.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.000
Inspector Murillo,
Forensic Inspector Vicuña is here.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.040
Would you come?

16:37.480 --> 16:38.320
Sure.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.240
Hello, Raquel.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.200
Thanks for calling.
It was very professional of you.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.000
How is Angel?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.960
Still in a coma. No news there.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.760
This is Salva, a friend of mine.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.880
More like my current partner.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.280
Salva.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.680
Inspector Alberto Vicuña.

17:21.880 --> 17:23.120
Salvador...

17:24.560 --> 17:26.000
Martin. Salvador Martin.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.320
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.880
I'm glad you're with her.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.280
I won't bother you.
You won't even know I'm here,

17:37.360 --> 17:38.960
but you'll have to fill me in.

18:15.800 --> 18:16.680
What's that?

18:17.800 --> 18:19.880
Four hundred sixty thousand euros.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.360
A little stash in case we get caught.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.120
To start from scratch, you and me.
When we get out of jail.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.800
I'm going to hide it here.
Behind our tile.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.080
I'll make a hole and seal it up after.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.920
In a few years we'll come back
and buy a condo in La Manga.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.640
That is if the euro still exists.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.880
Shit, you're right.

19:03.880 --> 19:04.920
Listen.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.800
You're not going to start again
about breaking up, are you?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.520
Wait until we get arrested
and do it with a letter or something.

19:13.080 --> 19:13.920
Listen to me.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.680
Things are going to get real ugly.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.640
I won't sit and watch,

19:23.320 --> 19:24.920
I'd rather join the bloodshed.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.280
I know.

19:27.640 --> 19:28.520
But not you.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.400
I need a favor.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.800
When the party starts...

19:39.440 --> 19:40.680
You will turn yourself in.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.320
You'll wave a white flag
and turn yourself in.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.640
It'll make things easier for you.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.240
When things get complicated...

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
I'll be with you.

19:55.680 --> 19:56.920
When the party starts...

19:59.360 --> 20:00.360
I'll be with you.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.360
No matter what.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.920
And you know what?

20:08.080 --> 20:10.440
I only wave the white flag
when Real Madrid wins.

20:19.000 --> 20:19.880
Okay.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.240
So now what? Let's fuck?

20:29.800 --> 20:30.680
Okay.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.880
Not a good time?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.120
Party time, then?

20:42.040 --> 20:42.960
Party time.

20:54.040 --> 20:54.960
Hey, come on.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.920
Did you know about that syndrome?

21:02.600 --> 21:05.640
Stockholm syndrome?
Yes, I had heard about it.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.760
I never forced her, I swear.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.280
I just brought her food and...

21:12.800 --> 21:14.560
She wrapped her arms around my neck.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.840
She tried to kiss me and wouldn’t let go.

21:17.320 --> 21:21.160
I swear we kissed for real,
I even started dancing in front of her.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.960
Look at her...

21:29.000 --> 21:31.120
When have you had a girlfriend like that?

21:32.480 --> 21:33.400
I had Vane.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.560
-Vane?
-Vane was pretty.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.200
Vane was neither pretty
nor smart nor good.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.720
You were from the same world
and had things in common.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.160
And what world is that?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.360
A shitty one, right?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.240
Look at her closely.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.680
Look at her!

21:54.560 --> 21:57.200
First of all, she's a civil servant.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.920
That means she studied a lot.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.360
Second, her last boyfriend was
the General Director of the Royal Mint.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.680
And third,
she's incredibly pretty and refined.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.560
She's out of your league, son.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.560
She's in the Champions League.

22:12.640 --> 22:17.640
-We're more in the regionals.
-Alright, that's enough, that's enough.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.440
I get it!

22:24.160 --> 22:25.480
I'm a loser.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.880
I have to think like a loser.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.920
And dream like a loser.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.840
I get it.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.000
Don't move!

22:43.640 --> 22:45.160
She said don't move, damn it!

22:45.640 --> 22:46.760
Hands on your head.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.080
Hey! What's going on!?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.160
This is very strange,

23:03.640 --> 23:04.960
and no one's calling.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.680
So if they're gunning us all down,

23:07.760 --> 23:09.320
at least we'll find out on TV.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.640
Right?

23:26.400 --> 23:27.360
It's okay.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.080
Monica Gaztambide, you're up.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.360
In the first inspection, we found
the prints of eight people.

23:55.080 --> 23:59.160
There's DNA in cigarette butts, gum,
toothpicks, even in a yogurt.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.240
More than 100 items of classified evidence
and counting.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.600
Looks like they wrote out the plan
on the blackboard.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.480
We're trying to reconstruct it.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.120
They left us their plan in writing?

24:12.320 --> 24:13.440
Yes, well...

24:14.320 --> 24:15.600
That's the question.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.840
If this a contaminated crime scene,

24:18.920 --> 24:21.240
or some lazy effort to destroy evidence.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.680
They got into
the Royal Mint and Stamp Factory,

24:24.760 --> 24:27.320
I doubt they are lacking
in effort or intelligence.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.160
None of this is worth shit.

24:32.520 --> 24:35.320
Angel is ahead of you
with the prints he found.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.480
-What prints?
-He didn't tell you?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.960
He got hold of a personal item,
a teaspoon.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.680
It had the same prints
that we found in the police car.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.240
Angel found someone from the group,
or was about to.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.680
If there's anything here,
I know where to find it. Come.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.640
Anything they really wanted destroyed,

25:01.880 --> 25:03.640
they must have burned in here.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.720
It's the safest way to destroy something.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.440
It's what anyone would have done.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.040
But there are only ashes in here,
and not many.

25:11.520 --> 25:14.080
Ashes that used to be lumber, coal...

25:15.000 --> 25:17.320
But also documents, photographs...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.920
A paper that, when burned,
loses most of its material.

25:21.600 --> 25:24.040
The fire creates a wisp of hot smoke,

25:24.400 --> 25:27.600
that raises those paper particles
through the chimney.

25:27.720 --> 25:31.480
Sometimes those particles stick to the
rough brick of the wall.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.720
If there's anything, it's in there.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.600
Let us get to work.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.360
Gandia,
bring the goggles and the infrared camera.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.000
Come on, girl, I'm in a hurry. Move it.

25:55.080 --> 25:55.960
Move.

25:56.800 --> 25:57.680
Get to work.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.640
Turn around.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.720
-You're serious today.
-No.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.640
Stop! You'll make me spill it.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.760
Right, you're going to spill it.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.360
I mean it, Monica.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.080
What's the matter?

26:41.120 --> 26:44.080
Have we run through our 60 hours of love?

26:44.160 --> 26:46.720
It just so happens that you're my hostage

26:46.800 --> 26:49.280
So we'll see about that when this is over.

26:49.720 --> 26:50.560
What?

26:51.600 --> 26:52.760
What's the matter?

26:53.720 --> 26:54.600
Come.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.080
Am I missing something?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.160
Maybe you haven't noticed
because you're here against your will,

27:06.800 --> 27:08.200
but you have a syndrome.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.760
-What syndrome?
-Stockholm syndrome.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.680
You fall in love with...

27:15.000 --> 27:16.960
The son of a bitch that kidnapped you.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.480
You're losing your mind,
treating me like I'm your boyfriend.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.360
-It's a mental thing that doctors treat...
-Listen.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.000
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.240
Of course you'd say that,

27:28.480 --> 27:29.680
you've got the syndrome.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.960
-Denver, it's not like that.
-What if you saw me on the street?

27:33.560 --> 27:36.880
What if I had ask you
for change for the slot machine at a bar?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.880
Would you have noticed me at all?

27:40.920 --> 27:41.760
Be honest.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.360
I didn't think so.

27:52.680 --> 27:53.600
That's it.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.320
You go your way...

27:58.640 --> 27:59.640
I'll go mine.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.240
And that's it.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
Wait.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.400
Do you have feelings

28:09.000 --> 28:10.080
for me?

28:11.120 --> 28:13.440
-I'm not suffering any syndrome.
-Denver.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.920
Do you have feelings?

28:20.000 --> 28:20.880
Yes.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.120
But what I feel is real,
it's not because of Stockholm.

28:24.680 --> 28:25.560
But you...

28:27.000 --> 28:28.720
I can't let you lose your mind.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.160
I can't.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.120
I can't do that to you.

29:04.280 --> 29:06.320
What's on your mind, green eyes?

29:24.880 --> 29:26.920
I want to know everything about you.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.040
Every day you've lived,

29:35.960 --> 29:38.600
every smile, every tear.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.520
Every happy moment.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.320
You're a wonderful mystery to me, Ariadna.

29:52.040 --> 29:52.960
For instance...

29:54.520 --> 29:56.120
Let's see. Your first kiss.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.320
Do you remember who it was?

30:05.800 --> 30:06.960
What was his name?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.800
Raul.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.480
Raul.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.560
Raul must have felt like a lucky man.

30:19.560 --> 30:22.880
Like Neil Armstrong, walking on the moon.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.720
First times are special.

30:33.560 --> 30:34.480
Unique.

30:38.400 --> 30:42.200
But the last times are beyond comparison,
priceless.

30:49.800 --> 30:50.920
But people...

30:52.760 --> 30:54.320
Don’t usually know it.

30:58.960 --> 31:01.440
You see, I have six months left to live.

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
Or four.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.760
Maybe even less.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.880
And one of the few things

31:14.800 --> 31:16.880
that I really care about right now...

31:17.720 --> 31:18.880
Do you know what it is?

31:20.680 --> 31:21.560
To know...

31:22.920 --> 31:24.440
That I will live in here.

31:26.880 --> 31:27.920
In your mind.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.480
Forever.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.480
Inside this beautiful head.

31:42.120 --> 31:42.960
Berlin.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.880
Something happened. Something serious.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.960
Excuse me, where are
the officers that were going to Madrid?

32:01.200 --> 32:02.880
No one is leaving at the moment.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.880
I see, then I'll have to walk
to the main road.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.440
Can I just say goodbye to the inspector?

32:09.640 --> 32:10.640
Come with me.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.880
Are you sure you want to do that?

33:05.960 --> 33:07.920
You should take it all with you.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.560
No.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.200
Tomorrow these will
no longer be memories, just...

33:18.000 --> 33:20.600
Evidence against someone
under an arrest warrant.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.160
Besides, nostalgia can be seductive.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.800
It is hard to let go of the memories
because we think...

33:41.920 --> 33:46.440
That they really are happy moments, but...

33:50.760 --> 33:51.880
They're not.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.920
And what we will do tomorrow
requires us to think about the present.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.160
Not the past.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.600
That was your father.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.760
BANK ROBBER JESUS MARQUINA
DIES IN A SHOOTOUT

34:14.840 --> 34:16.080
AT HISPANO AMERICANO BANK.

34:16.160 --> 34:17.600
That's all that matters.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.080
We're doing it for him.

34:59.840 --> 35:03.040
More than 50 troops have moved
to the Toledo estate,

35:03.120 --> 35:06.920
including the Chief Inspector,
the General Operative Sub-director

35:07.000 --> 35:09.560
of Special Operations and forensic agents,

35:09.640 --> 35:13.440
who continue to work in the house

35:13.520 --> 35:17.000
where the heist may have been planned.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.520
The Professor was arrested.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.840
They're interrogating him
in the house in Toledo.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.880
Although the judge declared secrecy,

35:22.960 --> 35:25.400
forensic police may have found evidence

35:25.480 --> 35:29.080
that confirm the presence
of at least three...

35:31.120 --> 35:32.080
Damn it!

35:35.920 --> 35:36.760
Shit!

35:37.640 --> 35:39.280
They cut off the signal.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.360
We're screwed.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.120
They don't want us to know.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.400
And that means they're coming in.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.320
We can sit here for five hours,

35:47.400 --> 35:49.320
or fucking start Plan Chernobyl,

35:49.640 --> 35:50.920
which sounds better to me.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.120
Plan Chernobyl
is for desperate situations,

35:53.200 --> 35:56.640
and I don’t think this is the
most desperate we can take, is it?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.840
It's a plan in which you'd lose the money.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.480
I have no desire to give it up. Do you?

36:08.560 --> 36:11.520
Will you give up everything
you fought for, Tokyo?

36:13.600 --> 36:15.440
Guys, they have the Professor.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.800
There won't be a tunnel in the hangar,

36:17.880 --> 36:20.040
because the fucking GEO will be waiting.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.200
We're fucking trapped!

36:21.280 --> 36:24.400
He will call within the next
five hours. I still believe in him.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.200
I'm not big on democracy,
but suddenly I feel like voting.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.960
Who still believes in the Professor?

36:35.480 --> 36:36.360
Helsinki?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.880
I believe in the Professor.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.640
Rio.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.200
I believe what I see.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.400
And what I see
is that we can't count on him.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.920
I'm with Tokyo.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.240
Moscow.

37:10.040 --> 37:11.840
I entered under certain rules,

37:13.560 --> 37:15.240
and the rules have not been broken.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.000
I trust the Professor.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.400
Denver.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.560
I vote to get out of here, now.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.080
Being a multimillionaire doesn't suit me.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.920
Alright, Denver.

37:41.000 --> 37:41.960
Three and three.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.400
Nairobi, your call.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.960
You break the tie.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.520
I have a very good reason
to be with the Professor,

37:58.600 --> 38:02.200
and unless he's dead,
I'll believe in him until the end.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.600
I'm with Berlin.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.040
Raquel,

38:30.320 --> 38:32.640
Raquel, sorry to bother you but...

38:32.800 --> 38:34.440
It's getting late, and...

38:34.520 --> 38:36.240
I'm taking this to Canillas.

38:36.520 --> 38:39.520
Look, I was just going
to catch the bus for Madrid.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.320
I can give him a lift.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.600
What?

38:46.120 --> 38:48.000
Well, actually it works for me.

38:54.000 --> 38:54.840
Let's go.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.880
Don't judge him.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.720
Helsinki did what he had to do.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.120
What soldiers do in war.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.400
What we do with animals
to stop them from suffering.

41:18.200 --> 41:19.080
Not in hatred,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.040
but as an act of compassion.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.120
Put it down.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.320
I too did what I had to do.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.320
Not in hatred,

42:02.120 --> 42:03.560
but as an act of compassion.

42:04.800 --> 42:05.680
After all,

42:06.400 --> 42:08.880
what's more human than
the fight for survival?

42:38.000 --> 42:40.280
