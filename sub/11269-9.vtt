Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:05.154 --> 00:06.921
Hi, Miss Howe.

00:06.923 --> 00:08.156
Hi, Kelly.

00:08.157 --> 00:11.376
This... is for you.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.411
For me?

00:13.445 --> 00:15.279
What is it?

00:15.280 --> 00:16.314
(gasps)

00:16.315 --> 00:19.751
Oh, Kelly, this is beautiful.

00:19.785 --> 00:21.169
Why me?

00:21.203 --> 00:24.405
Because I like you and you've
always shown me friendship.

00:24.406 --> 00:25.508
Well, that's sweet, Kelly.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.175
Thank you.

00:27.209 --> 00:29.678
And I want you to keep
your hands off my man.

00:32.265 --> 00:34.049
Do we understand each other?

00:34.100 --> 00:36.283
Not really.
(laughs)

00:36.352 --> 00:38.119
Don't play dumb with me,
Miss Howe.

00:38.154 --> 00:39.454
I invented it.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.775
You know, Woody tells me
how you look at him.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.126
Kelly, I don't look at him.

00:45.161 --> 00:46.528
I know you do, Miss Howe,

00:46.530 --> 00:50.081
and I'm prepared to buy you
one of these every month

00:50.116 --> 00:52.750
if you keep away from my Woody.

00:55.621 --> 00:58.957
Well, you know, Kelly,
he is awfully cute.

00:58.991 --> 01:00.358
All right, one a week.

01:00.392 --> 01:02.594
Do we have a deal?
Deal.

01:04.797 --> 01:08.015

(door opens)

02:22.008 --> 02:24.208
A Scotch, please, Sam.

02:24.242 --> 02:26.644
And how about a beer
for my friend Norm there?

02:26.679 --> 02:27.929
Thank you, Fras.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.814
You're certainly in
a chipper mood today.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.866
And why not?
It's a beautiful day.

02:31.867 --> 02:32.767
Yeah, good for you.

02:32.768 --> 02:33.934
You know, it's amazing

02:33.935 --> 02:36.225
how fast you've gotten
over your separation.

02:36.238 --> 02:39.507
Well, a healthy mental
attitude- that's my secret.

02:39.541 --> 02:41.542
Without that, you're nothing.

02:41.543 --> 02:43.110
Ah, that's great, that's great.

02:43.111 --> 02:45.129
You're completely over Lilith.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.798
I'm sorry, who?

02:47.783 --> 02:49.751
Lilith, your wife.

02:49.785 --> 02:51.719
Never heard of the slut.

02:51.721 --> 02:53.504
(door opens)

02:53.539 --> 02:55.356
Big news, everybody.

02:55.358 --> 02:58.093
Put down your beer mugs
and hold on to your barstools.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.477
Me and Ma just got
a new neighbour,

02:59.478 --> 03:01.012
moved into our
apartment building...

03:01.013 --> 03:03.047
little guy,
about a hundred years old,

03:03.049 --> 03:06.600
up from South America,
thick German accent,

03:06.635 --> 03:08.769
little moustache
right about here.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.188
Likes to paint.

03:11.223 --> 03:13.333
I think you know
where I'm going with this.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.443
Sweet Lord, I'll bet I do.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.013
Yep, Adolf Hitler is living
in my apartment building.

03:19.014 --> 03:22.651
Cliff, I don't even know
why I have to tell you this,

03:22.652 --> 03:24.218
but Hitler is dead.

03:24.253 --> 03:26.721
He died at the end of World
War II in that bunker.

03:26.722 --> 03:27.706
Oh, yeah, really?

03:27.707 --> 03:28.973
Were you at the bunker?

03:29.008 --> 03:30.638
Yeah, as a
matter of fact... Cliff,

03:30.710 --> 03:35.329
throughout the years, we've
become accustomed to your...

03:35.330 --> 03:36.931
oh, how shall
I delicately put this?...

03:36.932 --> 03:39.467
uh... madness.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.340
Now, for my own peace of mind,
please assure me

03:45.341 --> 03:47.442
that you're not going
to march up to this man

03:47.443 --> 03:49.877
and accuse him
of being der Führer.

03:49.895 --> 03:51.680
No, my accusations won't come

03:51.714 --> 03:54.382
until after I complete
my investigation.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.202
The case will be rock solid,

03:57.204 --> 03:58.720
and it'd better be.

03:58.754 --> 04:01.056
I-I've been wrong
twice before, you know.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.341
Sa-am.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.893
Wha-at?

04:05.911 --> 04:08.797
I haven't been down here
since the fire.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.566
By the way,
when are you going to rebuild?

04:11.568 --> 04:13.751
We have.

04:13.753 --> 04:17.454
Oh, well, and it looks very...

04:17.490 --> 04:19.357
The reason I'm down here

04:19.425 --> 04:21.115
is, last night our refrigerator

04:21.127 --> 04:22.226
went on the fritz,

04:22.227 --> 04:24.211
leaving us with a hundred pounds
of mackerel,

04:24.212 --> 04:26.781
which may
or may not have gone bad.

04:26.782 --> 04:28.516
Now, not wanting to take
a chance with my customers,

04:28.517 --> 04:30.401
I'm prepared

04:30.436 --> 04:33.037
to offer a special
to your patrons.

04:33.071 --> 04:36.307
All-you-can-eat for two dollars.

04:36.308 --> 04:37.491
Oh, whoa, whoa,
wait a second here.

04:37.492 --> 04:39.928
What makes you think my
customers want your rotten fish?

04:39.929 --> 04:41.646
NORM:
W-W-W-Wait, Sammy, wa-wa-wait now.

04:41.647 --> 04:44.799
Uh... let's just
say, Mr. Hill,

04:44.833 --> 04:46.767
that this, this
fish has spoiled.

04:46.801 --> 04:49.037
Uh, what would happen to us?

04:49.071 --> 04:51.873
Oh, you could suffer
a variety of symptoms

04:51.907 --> 04:55.043
ranging from nausea to death.

04:55.077 --> 04:57.745
Two bucks, you say?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.533
Fair enough.

05:05.338 --> 05:10.125
Oh, good, my package from
Amityville has arrived.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.926
Ah, Miss Tortelli.

05:11.961 --> 05:13.595
Tell me, is that a new hairdo

05:13.629 --> 05:16.864
or did someone toss a toaster
in your bathtub?

05:16.932 --> 05:18.199
(chuckling)

05:18.234 --> 05:19.734
What am I saying?

05:19.768 --> 05:22.604
What would you be doing
in a bathtub?

05:22.688 --> 05:26.975
Cleaning you out of the drain.

05:26.977 --> 05:29.543
Yeasty oil slick.

05:29.612 --> 05:30.779
Bladder polyp.

05:30.780 --> 05:31.846
Manwich.

05:31.847 --> 05:33.314
Perverted goat boy.

05:33.348 --> 05:35.750
Sluttish mole.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.551
7:00 tonight?

05:37.586 --> 05:38.636
Make it 6:30.

05:40.623 --> 05:45.026
That man is the foulest, most
disgusting, hideous creature

05:45.060 --> 05:47.729
to ever walk the
face of this earth,

05:47.763 --> 05:49.864
and he's all mine.

05:56.389 --> 05:59.123
Well, I'm gonna head
up to Melville's,

05:59.141 --> 06:01.675
see if they've got another
fish fry going today.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.444
Hey, actually, Norm,

06:03.479 --> 06:05.195
you ought to be
careful, you know.

06:05.196 --> 06:06.847
I think you were
just lucky yesterday

06:06.848 --> 06:08.449
that you didn't
get really sick.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.051
Who said I didn't get sick?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.922
(door opens)

06:14.990 --> 06:16.825
Well, all right, everybody.

06:16.859 --> 06:18.293
Drop what you're doing,

06:18.327 --> 06:19.727
stop the presses.

06:19.728 --> 06:20.712
Nobody's going to be making fun

06:20.713 --> 06:22.714
of Cliff Clavin anymore.

06:22.748 --> 06:24.548
That's for sure.

06:24.583 --> 06:28.686
Look, what I found in the
trash of Mr. A. Hitler.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.521
Behold, exhibit "A."

06:30.555 --> 06:32.256
What's this, a check stub here?

06:32.290 --> 06:34.125
It's a Social
Security check stub,

06:34.226 --> 06:36.010
and it sickens me.

06:36.011 --> 06:37.729
To think that we Americans
worked our fingers

06:37.730 --> 06:38.846
to the bone

06:38.881 --> 06:42.783
so Mr. Hitler could
have creamed corn.

06:44.687 --> 06:46.403
A cereal box?

06:46.438 --> 06:48.472
That's right, Paul,
it's a cereal box.

06:48.506 --> 06:50.041
I guess we can
determine that...

06:50.043 --> 06:52.944
Trix are for kids
and for der Führer.

06:54.029 --> 06:55.863
Cliff, what is that thing?

06:55.864 --> 06:57.982
This is the most sophisticated
and high-tech listening device

06:57.983 --> 06:58.983
that money can buy.

06:58.984 --> 07:00.117
Gentlemen,

07:00.119 --> 07:03.371
say hello
to Mr. Ear.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.340
Mr. Ear.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.741
That's right, you see,
if I'm going to stop

07:06.742 --> 07:07.976
the Fourth Reich from happening,

07:07.977 --> 07:10.211
I have to know every move
that Hitler makes.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.546
With this baby,

07:11.630 --> 07:14.381
I can hear a pin drop
at 500 feet away.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.534
See those two chicks up there?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.187
I'll tell you exactly what
they're talking about.

07:19.188 --> 07:23.758
They're talking about some
stupid-looking yutz holding a...

07:23.759 --> 07:25.126
never mind.

07:27.062 --> 07:28.779
All right.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.449
Look, wish me luck, everybody.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.851
If I'm not back in two hours,
call the Defence Department.

07:33.852 --> 07:37.454
Tell them Hitler's alive and
living in my apartment building.

07:37.489 --> 07:41.058
They know the address.

07:41.076 --> 07:44.496
You know, Cliff's pulled
some pretty crazy stunts

07:44.530 --> 07:46.330
through the years, but...

07:46.331 --> 07:48.199
this is really starting
to get me worried.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.835
Yeah, maybe Cliff is really
going over the edge here.

07:50.836 --> 07:51.903
Gentlemen,

07:51.921 --> 07:53.538
if I may be the voice
of reason,

07:53.572 --> 07:54.806
what if it is Hitler?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.774
(door opens)

07:56.809 --> 07:58.592
Woody,

07:58.677 --> 08:00.261
I heard every word you said.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.096
Thanks for being
in my corner, pal.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.568
I knew he was listening.

08:07.603 --> 08:10.304
Now, when he snaps,
maybe he'll spare me.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.408
Well, bad news, boys.

08:14.442 --> 08:16.310
No fish fry at Melville's.

08:16.311 --> 08:17.979
Apparently,
John Hill had a heart attack.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.046
Oh, really?

08:19.048 --> 08:20.865
Oh, my God, that's terrible.

08:20.899 --> 08:21.949
Relax, Rebecca,

08:22.001 --> 08:23.851
there'll be other fish fries.

08:23.885 --> 08:25.719
It's okay.

08:25.720 --> 08:26.704
Let's look at the
long view here.

08:26.705 --> 08:28.372
I was talking about John Hill.

08:28.373 --> 08:29.641
What hospital
is he in? Arlington.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.042
Should we visit him
at the hospital?

08:31.043 --> 08:32.744
Who wants to go?

08:32.745 --> 08:36.230
Come on, you guys,
he's our neighbour.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.383
We know him, we should see him
in the hospital.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.602
Rebecca, it's not like he's
our best friend or anything.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.818
Norm, that's not the point.

08:41.820 --> 08:44.288
The point is, you have to
pretend to be nice to people.

08:44.289 --> 08:46.099
That's what makes you
a good person.

08:48.777 --> 08:51.479
Hello, yes, I want
to inquire about the status

08:51.513 --> 08:54.481
of one of your patients-
Mr. John Allen Hill.

08:54.482 --> 08:55.600
Oh, thank you.

08:55.601 --> 08:56.751
That's great news.

08:56.819 --> 08:58.919
Oh, thanks very much.

08:58.921 --> 09:00.988
Whoa, thank God.

09:01.023 --> 09:04.274
Dead, Sam?

09:04.309 --> 09:05.359
No, he's not dead.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.277
He's in stable condition.

09:07.278 --> 09:09.181
That's a terrible
thing to say, Woody.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.472
You're always acting
like you don't like him.

09:11.473 --> 09:13.217
That doesn't mean I
wish he were dead.

09:13.218 --> 09:14.252
Well, what about yesterday

09:14.253 --> 09:16.020
when you said
"I wish he was dead"?

09:16.021 --> 09:17.055
(door opens)

09:17.056 --> 09:18.923
Hi, everybody.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.708
Carla, what are you doing here?

09:21.727 --> 09:24.595
Living my lifelong dream,

09:24.629 --> 09:26.597
fulfilling all my fantasies.

09:26.631 --> 09:28.232
I'm a cocktail waitress.

09:28.266 --> 09:30.067
What do you think
I'm doing here?!

09:30.068 --> 09:33.053
Sam, she doesn't know
about Hill yet.

09:33.054 --> 09:35.523
What are we going to do?
This is going to crush her.

09:35.524 --> 09:38.325
Oh, all right, I'll,
uh, I'll tell her.

09:38.326 --> 09:40.427
Sam, news of this gravity
should be delivered

09:40.428 --> 09:43.664
by someone who has
studied the human psyche

09:43.665 --> 09:45.617
in great detail-
someone who has tact,

09:45.618 --> 09:50.004
compassion, and an understanding
of the human heart.

09:50.039 --> 09:51.739
Okay, Dr. Crane,
I'll do it,

09:51.740 --> 09:53.374
but you've got to
deliver this martini.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.110
Carla!

09:56.111 --> 09:57.144
Woody.

09:57.145 --> 09:58.129
What?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.964
I was referring to myself.

10:00.015 --> 10:03.284
Oh, right.

10:03.318 --> 10:05.786
(muttering):
Calling Dr. Von Ego.

10:07.723 --> 10:09.557
Carla, may I have
a word with you?

10:09.591 --> 10:11.892
Sure.
Please, sit down.

10:14.763 --> 10:17.898
What I'm about to tell you may
be a little difficult to hear.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.717
Oh, my God.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.536
And before I tell you what
it is, I just want you to know

10:22.538 --> 10:24.888
that we are all your friends
and we support you.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.841
What is it?

10:27.910 --> 10:32.145
Carla, John Hill has
had a heart attack.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.832
Oh, my God.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.266
Hill had a heart attack?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.820
John Allen Hill
had a heart attack?

10:39.821 --> 10:42.189
(laughing):
That's what you were trying to tell me?

10:42.190 --> 10:43.424
From the way you were acting,

10:43.425 --> 10:46.126
I thought something
happened to my car.

10:50.516 --> 10:53.267
Carla, you knew?

10:53.352 --> 10:54.402
Of course I knew.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.770
I'm the one
who called the ambulance.

10:55.771 --> 10:57.437
Oh, well, then you were there.

10:57.472 --> 10:59.039
W-W-What, what happened?

10:59.041 --> 11:02.693
Well, Hill and I were in
the middle of doing it.

11:04.613 --> 11:05.696
Next thing I know,

11:05.697 --> 11:07.748
he's clutching his chest
and turning blue.

11:07.749 --> 11:10.384
I took it as a compliment
till he fell to the floor.

11:12.454 --> 11:15.823
So, uh, why didn't you go
with him to the hospital?

11:15.841 --> 11:16.991
I hate hospitals.

11:17.025 --> 11:19.227
I'll send him a card later
if I think of it.

11:19.228 --> 11:20.411
Now, just a minute,
Carla, listen.

11:20.412 --> 11:22.080
You've been seeing this man
for over a year now.

11:22.081 --> 11:24.048
Don't you have
any feelings for him?

11:24.099 --> 11:27.435
Listen, Doc, I've had
guys run out on me.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.869
I had a husband die on me.

11:28.903 --> 11:30.838
I got eight kids at
home to worry about.

11:30.839 --> 11:33.140
I don't need to go getting
attached to some other guy

11:33.141 --> 11:35.843
just because we sweat up
the sheets now and then.

11:39.364 --> 11:42.032
I couldn't care
less about Hill.

11:42.067 --> 11:44.801
You feel so strongly about
him, you go visit him.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.938
You ready to order?

11:47.973 --> 11:50.683
Uh, yes, we'd like a gin and
tonic with a lime, please,

11:50.708 --> 11:52.509
a Diet Coke, a Manhattan up,

11:52.543 --> 11:55.479
and we'll also need some
fresh pretzels and, and...

11:55.513 --> 11:57.803
(crying)
I-Is there something wrong, Miss?

11:59.084 --> 12:02.203
(sobbing):
My boyfriend's in the hospital.

12:12.448 --> 12:15.116
I'm so ashamed.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.201
I called Hill my boyfriend.

12:17.235 --> 12:19.086
What's wrong with me?

12:19.120 --> 12:20.755
FRASIER:
Carla,

12:20.757 --> 12:22.540
you've come down
with a bad case

12:22.574 --> 12:24.708
of humanity.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.129
A malady characterized

12:28.163 --> 12:30.631
by bouts of compassion,
warmth and caring.

12:30.632 --> 12:32.834
I mean, who knows, this sort
of thing could go on

12:32.835 --> 12:34.202
for the rest of your life.

12:34.204 --> 12:35.837
Shut up, fathead!

12:36.972 --> 12:40.708
Or it could pass
in a matter of seconds.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.476
Everybody, just leave me alone.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.312
You're making this
into something it's not.

12:45.314 --> 12:49.116
Carla, you cannot hold something
like this inside of you.

12:49.151 --> 12:50.934
PHIL:
Yeah, Carla,

12:50.936 --> 12:54.288
I never shared how I feel
and now I'm old and all alone.

12:54.323 --> 12:56.023
If there's one thing
I learned...

12:56.108 --> 12:57.158
Hey, Phil, zip it!

12:58.443 --> 13:01.578
Look, first of all,

13:01.612 --> 13:04.581
I don't have any feelings
for that slug.

13:04.615 --> 13:07.217
Second of all,
you never saw me cry.

13:07.218 --> 13:08.886
Third, I'd like
to stay and chat

13:08.887 --> 13:10.187
but I've got work to do.

13:10.221 --> 13:12.355
Sam, I want to talk
to you in the office.

13:15.177 --> 13:16.944
Oh, I don't, I don't
want to hear

13:16.945 --> 13:18.662
about her relationship
with John Hill.

13:18.663 --> 13:20.932
I don't understand what they do
when they get together anyway,

13:20.933 --> 13:22.333
and I don't want to.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.802
I wish there was some way
I could get out of this.

13:24.836 --> 13:27.006
Well, why don't you
just wish she was dead?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.915
Hey.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.250
How ya doin', huh?

13:39.284 --> 13:40.918
Oh, Sam.

13:40.919 --> 13:43.120
Hill's in the hospital
and it's all my fault.

13:43.121 --> 13:45.789
Naw, see, now you can't
blame yourself for that.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.675
Oh, but it's true.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.677
You see,

13:49.711 --> 13:52.680
last night started out
as just an average date.

13:52.714 --> 13:55.683
Hill and I getting it
on hot and heavy.

13:55.717 --> 13:58.185
I'm cursing at him,
he's cursing at me...

13:58.220 --> 14:00.053
some real beauties.

14:00.088 --> 14:02.423
The headboard was
begging for mercy.

14:02.507 --> 14:05.059
Do me a favour
and just cut the chase.

14:05.093 --> 14:08.229
Unless there was a chase
and- oh, God, no.

14:08.263 --> 14:10.197
Uh...

14:11.833 --> 14:13.801
I'm a little...
Okay. Okay.

14:13.835 --> 14:16.804
Just before he keeled over,

14:16.838 --> 14:18.973
I went over the line.

14:19.007 --> 14:21.742
I said something so awful, I...

14:21.777 --> 14:23.811
I can't even repeat it.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.831
Oh, honey.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.666
Well, what'd you say?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.571
(mumbling)

14:34.573 --> 14:36.390
I'm sorry, what?

14:37.509 --> 14:39.477
(clears throat)

14:39.511 --> 14:41.512
I told him I loved him.

14:41.546 --> 14:43.180
And that's...

14:43.215 --> 14:45.016
and that's bad,
right? Of course.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.351
Uh-huh.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.520
Of course that's bad!

14:49.554 --> 14:50.688
Mm.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.223
Sam, you don't get this, do you?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.158
Look,

14:54.192 --> 14:57.094
Hill and I have a very
simple relationship.

14:57.112 --> 14:59.430
I don't like him,
he doesn't like me,

14:59.464 --> 15:00.998
we get it on.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.951
Now, if we start saying
we like each other,

15:03.986 --> 15:05.953
we're gonna screw up
what we had.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.455
And then I'm gonna lose him

15:07.456 --> 15:09.957
and I don't want to lose him,
'cause I care for him.

15:09.958 --> 15:11.925
(gasps) What is with me?!

15:11.960 --> 15:14.395
I'm, I'm getting lost here.

15:14.396 --> 15:15.863
Do-do you like this guy
or not?

15:15.864 --> 15:16.998
Of course I do.

15:17.032 --> 15:18.082
But I can't tell him.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.300
Why not?

15:19.301 --> 15:20.400
Because if I tell him,

15:20.401 --> 15:22.269
then he won't have
anything to do with me.

15:22.270 --> 15:23.570
Just like if he told me,

15:23.604 --> 15:25.594
I wouldn't have anything
to do with him.

15:25.606 --> 15:28.408
Oh, all right, all right,
all right, I see.

15:28.442 --> 15:30.410
So-so you're saying...

15:30.444 --> 15:31.645
shoot!

15:31.680 --> 15:33.613
I almost had it.

15:39.854 --> 15:42.790
I guess there's only
one thing I can do.

15:42.791 --> 15:44.291
I've gotta go to the hospital

15:44.292 --> 15:45.893
and straighten
things out. Yes! Yes!

15:45.894 --> 15:47.561
That's it! You've gotta
go to the hospital,

15:47.562 --> 15:49.596
and no matter how much
it costs you...

15:49.630 --> 15:51.980
you've gotta tell the guy
that you care for him.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.417
No, Sam.

15:53.451 --> 15:55.118
I have to go and tell him

15:55.153 --> 15:57.087
that I don't care
for him. Right!

15:57.088 --> 15:58.438
Right! I was gonna
say that next.

15:58.439 --> 15:59.807
You gotta go and tell him

15:59.875 --> 16:01.675
that you don't care for him.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.643
Right. Okay.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.516
All right.

16:11.353 --> 16:14.238
Who wants to know
what Hitler watches on TV?

16:15.906 --> 16:18.975
Cliff, I'm not gonna
play this stupid game anymore.

16:18.976 --> 16:21.112
Hitler does not live in
your apartment building.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.697
All right, from 1500 hours
to 1530 hours,

16:23.731 --> 16:25.332
he watched The Flintstones.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.585
Instead of Gilligan's Island?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.352
Well, he is a mad man.

16:29.738 --> 16:33.207
From 1530 hours to 1600
he watched People's Court.

16:33.241 --> 16:36.043
How ironic.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.477
At 1630 hours,

16:37.512 --> 16:40.680
he clapped off the TV
and went to bed.

16:40.716 --> 16:42.766
Oh, my God, Norm!

16:42.767 --> 16:43.850
It's him.
Hide me.

16:43.851 --> 16:45.402
This is the guy
you thought was Hitler?

16:45.403 --> 16:46.537
No, no, worse!

16:46.538 --> 16:48.139
It's my landlord,
Mr. Cranston.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.974
Clavin, don't you try
to hide from me!

16:49.975 --> 16:52.526
I'm here to inform you

16:52.560 --> 16:54.528
we held a tenants
meeting last night.

16:54.562 --> 16:56.297
Uh, I wasn't invited.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.732
We never invite you
when it's about you.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.400
Was Hitler there?

17:00.434 --> 17:01.701
Yes, Hitler was there...

17:01.737 --> 17:03.820
or Mr. O'Leary

17:03.854 --> 17:05.954
as he's known to us
on Planet Earth.

17:07.409 --> 17:09.159
Yeah, what was the
meeting about?

17:09.160 --> 17:10.911
Well, I intended
to have you evicted.

17:10.912 --> 17:13.246
You've done some strange things
in your time, Clavin,

17:13.247 --> 17:14.714
but this is the worst!

17:14.749 --> 17:16.550
You're harassing an old man!

17:16.585 --> 17:18.551
Who may well be the most hated

17:18.553 --> 17:20.087
and feared figure of the
Twentieth Century.

17:20.088 --> 17:22.556
Well, at least he's not
one of those noisy teens.

17:22.590 --> 17:24.324
Well, that's true.

17:24.358 --> 17:25.960
As I was saying,

17:26.044 --> 17:27.261
I was gonna boot you out,

17:27.262 --> 17:29.880
but your mother made a stirring
speech in your defence.

17:29.881 --> 17:32.683
By the time she finished reading
that passage from the Bible,

17:32.684 --> 17:34.685
we were all in tears.

17:34.719 --> 17:36.854
Even Hitler?

17:36.888 --> 17:38.188
Even Hitler.

17:38.222 --> 17:41.025
Oh, Mr. O'Leary.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.193
Now I will allow you to stay,

17:43.227 --> 17:44.528
if you apologize to him

17:44.529 --> 17:46.564
and promise not to pursue
this matter any further.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.965
Now do I have your word?

17:47.983 --> 17:49.700
Yeah, okay. I promise.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.402
So just don't boot us
out, all right?

17:51.403 --> 17:52.502
Agreed.

17:52.536 --> 17:53.670
Well, thank you.

17:53.704 --> 17:54.838
You know, I-I know

17:54.839 --> 17:56.106
I get out of hand occasionally.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.274
I've got all this
pent-up energy,

17:57.275 --> 17:58.441
a lot of time on my hands.

17:58.442 --> 18:00.077
You know, uh, I'm
Civil Service.

18:00.111 --> 18:01.411
Well, that explains it.

18:01.412 --> 18:03.798
I will let you off with a
warning this time, Clavin.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.584
Does this mean I can go back
in the laundry room?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.402
No. That's a whole
separate thing.

18:10.505 --> 18:12.473
Hmm.

18:12.507 --> 18:15.476
Well, Cliff, you've
tormented an elderly man,

18:15.510 --> 18:18.160
you got everyone in your
apartment building angry,

18:18.179 --> 18:20.147
and you almost lost your home.

18:20.181 --> 18:23.384
Now, are you clear
on what this means?

18:23.401 --> 18:25.319
Sure.

18:25.353 --> 18:27.721
Hitler brainwashed my landlord.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.535
Hill!

18:42.454 --> 18:44.688
Miss Tortelli!

18:44.756 --> 18:46.106
These are for you.

18:46.141 --> 18:47.941
Oh, what a thoughtful purchase.

18:47.975 --> 18:49.443
I didn't buy 'em.

18:49.477 --> 18:51.978
I got 'em out of a
room down the hall.

18:51.979 --> 18:54.048
The guy won't be needing
'em where he's going.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.849
Has he been discharged?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.017
You might say.

18:57.018 --> 19:00.187
If you ever need a
pair of slippers,

19:00.188 --> 19:01.655
size 11, let me know.

19:01.689 --> 19:03.157
Oh, thank you.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.025
Frankly, Miss Tortelli,

19:05.060 --> 19:06.693
I don't know why you're here.

19:06.727 --> 19:08.195
My doctor informs me

19:08.196 --> 19:10.531
I have to remain celibate
for the next eight weeks.

19:10.532 --> 19:12.616
Hey, don't insult me, Hill!

19:12.650 --> 19:15.118
You think that sex is
all I have on my mind?

19:15.152 --> 19:17.354
There are other facets
to my personality.

19:18.874 --> 19:20.090
Eight weeks?

19:22.077 --> 19:24.078
Well, anyway, look,

19:24.112 --> 19:27.481
I just came here because
I wanted to apologize.

19:27.549 --> 19:30.467
Last night, before
this happened,

19:30.501 --> 19:33.770
I said this thing to you,

19:33.838 --> 19:35.572
and, um,

19:35.590 --> 19:37.508
I just wanted you to know that

19:37.542 --> 19:40.410
this thing I said-
eight weeks?!

19:41.479 --> 19:43.813
Please continue, Miss Tortelli.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.785
Anyway, about this thing
that I said,

19:47.819 --> 19:50.153
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't mean it.

19:50.238 --> 19:52.372
Hill,

19:52.407 --> 19:55.525
do you remember what thing it is
I'm talking about?

19:55.577 --> 19:58.412
I must confess it rings
a faint bell...

19:58.446 --> 20:00.747
that thing.

20:00.748 --> 20:02.649
Well, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry,

20:02.650 --> 20:05.952
because I think it's
probably what caused your heart attack.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.922
It was quite a shock.

20:07.923 --> 20:10.258
I don't think anyone's
ever said it to me before.

20:10.259 --> 20:11.758
No one?

20:11.792 --> 20:13.093
Not even your daughter?

20:13.128 --> 20:14.995
Well, it never really came up.

20:18.816 --> 20:20.918
You had a wife.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.853
Well, she and I...

20:22.887 --> 20:25.055
had an understanding.

20:25.941 --> 20:28.375
Your parents?

20:28.393 --> 20:31.495
The point is, Miss Tortelli,

20:31.529 --> 20:34.765
I'm not exactly a cuddle bear.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.618
Yeah, well, neither am I.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.002
See you around.

20:39.037 --> 20:41.171
Uh, uh, one moment,
Miss Tortelli.

20:41.205 --> 20:43.206
Yeah.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.843
Perhaps the diuretic is making
me sentimental, but, uh...

20:48.830 --> 20:50.798
what do you suppose
would happen

20:50.799 --> 20:52.666
if we were foolhardy
enough to attempt

20:52.667 --> 20:55.135
to take our relationship
to the next plateau?

20:55.169 --> 20:57.705
Hypothetically, of course.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.641
Yeah, well,

21:00.675 --> 21:02.609
I have thought
about that a little bit.

21:02.677 --> 21:05.979
I'm not proud of it,
but I've thought of it.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.114
After all, we have
eight celibate weeks

21:08.132 --> 21:10.200
in which to get to know
each other better.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.119
Okay, I'm game.

21:16.691 --> 21:18.425
Uh, so, uh,

21:18.459 --> 21:20.527
Miss Tortelli.

21:20.612 --> 21:21.862
Carla.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.147
Oh, Carla!

21:26.534 --> 21:28.769
Carla- that's a pretty name.

21:28.837 --> 21:30.153
Thank you.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.208
So, uh,

21:34.242 --> 21:36.443
you, uh, you have any children?

21:40.015 --> 21:42.198
No.

21:44.886 --> 21:47.855
So, uh, what's it like
running a restaurant?

21:47.889 --> 21:49.556
Well, you know, a lot of work,

21:49.591 --> 21:51.224
but, uh, very rewarding.

21:51.259 --> 21:52.393
Oh, that's good.

21:52.427 --> 21:54.327
I mean that is rewarding.

21:54.362 --> 21:57.314
Because there are a lot of jobs
that aren't rewarding,

21:57.348 --> 21:59.449
and it's good
that you found a job

21:59.484 --> 22:01.651
that is rewarding.

22:01.703 --> 22:04.037
Carla, could you please
do me a small favour?

22:04.039 --> 22:05.472
Yes, John.

22:05.473 --> 22:07.458
Could you work yourself
behind this machinery

22:07.459 --> 22:09.392
and unplug my life-support
system

22:09.394 --> 22:11.094
so that I can leave this life

22:11.162 --> 22:13.931
and this agonizing
conversation behind?

22:13.933 --> 22:16.517
Oh, like it was fun
for me, zit face!

22:16.551 --> 22:17.851
Sasquatch.

22:17.886 --> 22:19.019
Road kill.

22:19.053 --> 22:20.854
Catcher's mitt.
Pond scum.

22:20.889 --> 22:21.955
Phlegm face.

22:21.956 --> 22:23.156
See you in eight weeks?

22:23.157 --> 22:24.792
Make it four.
Make it two.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.494
Pull the curtain.
