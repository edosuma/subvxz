WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:01.535
.

00:01.569 --> 00:02.536
- Happy pay day, everyone.
- You forgot someone.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.004
- There wasn't a check
in the package for you.

00:04.038 --> 00:05.106
- Maybe she took it.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.275
- She would never do that.
- She is either messing

00:07.308 --> 00:10.144
with me or she's incompetent.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.412
- I'm gonna really hate
to think

00:11.445 --> 00:13.581
that you would mess
with any of my friends here

00:13.614 --> 00:15.416
just to make yourself
look better.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.220
- So what happens
if I don't pay rent this month?

00:19.253 --> 00:21.089
- You can stay as long
as you want.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.157
- You're a good friend.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.394
- Dad, what's going on?

00:26.427 --> 00:29.263
- I've been imposing on you
for way too long.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.299
I've got three
great job leads.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.302
I'm on the move
to the next chapter of life

00:34.335 --> 00:36.170
of RamÃ³n Dawsona.

00:37.171 --> 00:37.971
- Mm.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.108
Well, the job's going great,
you know.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.675
They're not
the most friendly bunch,

00:41.709 --> 00:44.278
but, uh, they're warming up
to your pops, huh.

00:44.312 --> 00:45.613
- That's good.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.648
- They're a little outdated
in terms

00:47.681 --> 00:50.218
of the way
that they use their workforce.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.652
Long story short,

00:51.685 --> 00:54.122
I'm requesting a meeting
with Jake, okay?

00:54.155 --> 00:56.224
'Cause I want to
pitch some of my ideas

00:56.257 --> 00:58.259
for running
a smoother workplace.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.129
Jake's the division supervisor,
young--

01:01.162 --> 01:02.663
- How long's this company
been going?

01:02.696 --> 01:05.133
- Uh, 35 years.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.236
- And you been there...
like a month?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.604
- Yeah. A little more.
Why?

01:10.638 --> 01:13.607
- Well, maybe it'd be
a better idea if you settle in,

01:13.641 --> 01:15.876
keep your nose down,
get a year under your belt

01:15.909 --> 01:17.378
before you start
cracking eggshells, Dad.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.281
- Yeah, sure.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.383
Does Matt still have
his connections at City Hall?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.651
I mean, I'm assuming he does.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.287
Dave, who is the big boss,
okay?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.289
I happen to overhear
him talking

01:28.322 --> 01:31.159
about some rezoning issues
that he was having--

01:31.192 --> 01:32.726
- Forget it.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.595
Matt's done with politics
now and forever.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.298
- Okay.
Okay, well...

01:37.331 --> 01:40.401
It's just I was thinking--
- Not a good idea.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.606
- And the next morning--

01:45.639 --> 01:49.410
And that is why I will never
eat another Cronut.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.512
[sighs]

01:51.545 --> 01:53.447
Oh, hey, check it out.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.484
Huh, that's a shame.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.352
I always wanted to go in there.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.654
- Yeah, that's why they're
going out of business.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.460
[gentle music]

02:06.494 --> 02:08.929
We could use some more stock
at Molly's.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.232
*

02:11.265 --> 02:14.635
I got to tell Herrmann.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.338
[car beeps]
- I'm telling you.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.240
Look, you want to set
the right tone.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.742
So you put on Sade
"Diamond life."

02:21.775 --> 02:23.577
- I usually don't pay attention
to the music.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.180
- I know, I'm trying to help
you up your game.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.381
- My game needs no upping.
- Ehh.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.217
- You know what?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.219
Why don't you just
pay attention to yourself.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.420
- Still gonna buy you the album

02:32.453 --> 02:33.687
so you'll have it
on your iTunes.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.289
[alarm sounds]
- Truck 81.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.957
Ambulance 61, Engine 51

02:36.990 --> 02:39.360
845 Dearborn Avenue,
Restaurant Fire.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.662
[sirens wailing]

02:41.695 --> 02:44.798
[dramatic music]

02:44.832 --> 02:52.206
*

02:58.246 --> 02:59.747
- What do we got?
- It was a grease fire,

02:59.780 --> 03:01.449
but it spread so fast...

03:01.482 --> 03:03.317
Everyone's out
of the floor level but...

03:03.351 --> 03:05.786
- Otis. Raise the aerial.
- Copy.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.789
[indistinct shouting]

03:08.822 --> 03:13.261
*

03:20.301 --> 03:23.304
[ladder whirring]

03:23.337 --> 03:26.307
[indistinct shouting]

03:26.340 --> 03:29.310
[suspenseful music]

03:29.343 --> 03:36.350
*

03:44.325 --> 03:45.626
- Line up.
Stay calm.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.461
- Line up over here.
Nice and easy.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.530
One at a time.
Come on.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.399
- Let's line up, guys.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.334
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's go!

03:53.367 --> 03:54.768
- One at a time, one at a time.
Stay calm, good job.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.371
- Hey, listen, one at a time.
Let's go.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.739
- [coughing]
[crash]

03:58.772 --> 04:00.774
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You good?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.510
- Yeah.
- Step this way, come on.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.811
- Come on.
- On this side.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.513
- You're all right.
- Let's move on.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.047
[woman and baby crying]
- Let's go!

04:07.080 --> 04:08.749
- Stay calm, stay calm.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.319
- Get in line.
- Oh, my God, please!

04:11.352 --> 04:13.321
- Hang on.
Let's go!

04:13.354 --> 04:15.623
- No! My baby!

04:15.656 --> 04:17.625
[baby crying]

04:17.658 --> 04:20.361
- Ma'am, you got to get back
from the fire.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.762
- Help me! I can't get it out.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.632
It's too hot!
- Kidd!

04:24.665 --> 04:26.767
- Help me! Oh, my God!
Please help. Please!

04:26.800 --> 04:29.303
- [grunts]
- [crying] I can't.

04:29.337 --> 04:31.505
[wailing]

04:31.539 --> 04:33.841
- Help. Come on.
- No! No!

04:33.874 --> 04:35.643
- Ma'am, come on.
We got to get out of here.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.345
- No! I'm not leaving my baby!

04:37.378 --> 04:38.879
- We got her.
- Josefina! Josefina!

04:38.912 --> 04:40.814
- Ma'am, she's got your baby.
Let us do our jobs.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.750
- [crying]

04:42.783 --> 04:44.552
- [panting] All right.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.555
[woman crying]
- Shh. It's going to be okay.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.390
[baby crying]

04:49.423 --> 04:51.425
*

04:51.459 --> 04:54.094
- [breathing heavily]

04:54.127 --> 04:56.597
*

04:56.630 --> 04:58.699
- Hey!
Kidd!

04:58.732 --> 05:00.468
- Let's go.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.537
[grunts, breathing heavily]

05:03.837 --> 05:06.407
- Come on.
- [grunts]

05:06.440 --> 05:09.643
[groans]

05:09.677 --> 05:11.845
- Move.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.616
[baby crying]
- You're all right.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.451
- Got it.
- There we go.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.753
Okay.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.121
- Up.

05:21.154 --> 05:26.627
*

05:26.660 --> 05:28.662
[baby crying]

05:29.763 --> 05:31.799
- Turn around.
There you go.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.734
Turn around.
You've got it.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.736
Nice and easy.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.506
Go down slowly, sir.
[baby wailing]

05:38.539 --> 05:39.840
Yeah, good.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.842
[soft dramatic music]

05:41.875 --> 05:43.477
- Just wait.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.913
*

05:45.946 --> 05:48.649
- I got you.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.719
- Oh, I know. I know.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.153
She's safe and sound.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.556
- Oh, my God.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.425
- Let's have ambo
check her out

05:57.458 --> 05:58.892
just to make sure
everything's okay, all right?

05:58.926 --> 06:00.994
- Thank you.
- Oh, shh, shh.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.896
It's okay.
- Thank you so much.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.666
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.502
- Oh. Oh.
[crying]

06:08.536 --> 06:10.404
Okay.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.740
*

06:12.773 --> 06:14.842
It's okay, baby.
- Yeah.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.845
[soft music]

06:17.878 --> 06:20.180
*

06:20.213 --> 06:21.949
- What?

06:27.855 --> 06:30.023
- Fire's out.
- Yep.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.860
- All right, 81,
let's pack her up.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.968
- Man.
Hey.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.771
What do you think of these?

06:43.804 --> 06:46.640
- I heard they have some now
where they change colors

06:46.674 --> 06:48.542
when you set your beer
on them.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.710
- What?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.445
- Special paper.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.614
- Hey. Herrmann.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.549
- What do you think of these?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.650
- They're fine.
So, listen.

06:56.684 --> 06:57.785
There's this bar over by where

06:57.818 --> 06:59.487
Cruz and Brett and I live...

06:59.520 --> 07:00.988
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, it's called Mac's Bar.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.224
- M-A-X?
- No, M-A-C-apostrophe-S.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.026
It's not important.
What is important...

07:06.059 --> 07:09.530
It is that they are going
out of business.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.864
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Uh-huh.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.467
But what I thought is maybe
I could stop by

07:13.501 --> 07:14.802
and see what I
could scrounge up, you know,

07:14.835 --> 07:16.670
glassware, taps...

07:16.704 --> 07:18.739
cocktail napkins.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.074
Never know, might be able
to get some steals.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.043
- Uh-uh. Bad idea.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.645
- Well, what do you mean?

07:24.678 --> 07:25.713
You're the one
that's always going on

07:25.746 --> 07:26.947
about the cost of overhead.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.682
- Yeah, but we ain't
no vultures.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.584
You profit
on someone else's pain? Uh-uh.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.919
Bad luck.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.821
- We literally bought
a burned out bar.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.689
- Yeah, and it took us
three years to turn a profit.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.957
Think about it.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.592
- I don't understand
you sometimes.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.761
- Most of the time.
- That's it.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.631
There but for the grace
of God go I, boys.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.575
- [sighs]

07:54.608 --> 07:56.844
Connie.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.746
- Yes?

07:58.779 --> 08:00.748
- Where are the yellow forms
for the incident reports?

08:00.781 --> 08:02.616
- Um, they should be
on your desk.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.518
- They're not.
- Um--

08:04.552 --> 08:05.786
- Are these
what you're looking for?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.855
- Those are they.
Thank you, Hope.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.857
- No sweat.
Need anything else?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.959
Coffee?
- No, that's it.

08:16.029 --> 08:19.833
- I could have sworn...

08:19.867 --> 08:21.669
- He won't get out
of his own way.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.003
I tell him,
"Pop, you're new there.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.605
"You got to keep your head
down for a year.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.873
"You do your work,
don't make waves,

08:25.906 --> 08:27.140
"show up early, leave late,

08:27.174 --> 08:28.909
and they're gonna love you."

08:28.942 --> 08:30.711
- Yeah, because Dawsons
never make waves.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.979
- I'm gonna ignore that.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.747
- Well, maybe
they'll be impressed

08:33.781 --> 08:35.015
your dad took some initiative.
- No, uh-uh.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750
I know the ending
to that story,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.118
and it involves collecting
your things

08:38.151 --> 08:39.687
and being escorted
to the parking lot.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.855
- Come on.
- I've seen it.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.624
- Well, it's good
you're there for him.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.958
- I'm the only one he's got.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.894
Antonio's not talking to him.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.629
My mom deletes his text
messages without reading them.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.564
Like, I mean, it's just--

08:50.598 --> 08:51.965
It's just so frustrating,

08:51.999 --> 08:54.001
and he's alone and he's my dad,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.936
but I don't know--

08:55.969 --> 08:58.572
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.107
- Sometimes all you can do is

09:00.140 --> 09:04.077
help people pick up the pieces
when they fall down.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.888
- Uh-oh, Captain Casey's got
that look in his eye.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.725
- Oh, Casey's cooking.
What's the occasion?

09:17.758 --> 09:20.060
- Celebrating a job
well done today on Truck 81.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.195
- That's some real leadership
there, fellas.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.798
- Hey, I am a man
of the people.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.966
- Mm-hmm.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.602
- Stella...

09:28.636 --> 09:30.804

Thanks.

What?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.215
I...

09:42.249 --> 09:44.918
- What is it, Kidd?

09:44.952 --> 09:47.955
- I just got transferred to the
Office of Public Relations.

[tense music]

09:56.063 --> 09:56.229

09:56.263 --> 09:58.165

I'm not a desk jockey.
I just--

10:00.734 --> 10:01.334
What do I know
about public relations?

10:02.235 --> 10:02.870
I can barely keep up
with my own relations.

10:03.570 --> 10:04.037
- Yeah, I can attest to that.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.106
- Not in the mood.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.975
- Mouch, what can we do
from a union point-of-view?

10:08.008 --> 10:10.277
- Unfortunately, there's
not much the union can do.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.946
Stella will have
to fill out a grievance form,

10:12.980 --> 10:14.281
then wait
for a committee review,

10:14.314 --> 10:16.884
and hope they rule
in her favor, but...

10:16.917 --> 10:18.351
that could take months
or years.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.253
- Well, you're a Captain now.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.755
Don't you have a say
in personnel decisions?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.056
- I mean, you would think so.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.257
Can I put in a special request?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.358
- Above my pay grade.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.861
- Not above mine.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.130
Look, I was caught flatfooted
here too.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.132
I put in a call to
the Office of Public Relations

10:32.165 --> 10:35.903
and not only is
the transfer happening...

10:35.936 --> 10:37.838
It's happening next shift.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.072
So I put in a call
to Chief Huffhines

10:39.106 --> 10:40.774

the department

10:40.808 --> 10:42.009
He hasn't gotten
back to me yet,

10:42.042 --> 10:43.877
but I want to talk
it over with him.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.212
And I want to assure him
that I think

10:45.245 --> 10:46.914
the services of Stella Kidd
are best served

10:46.947 --> 10:49.216
with Halligan in her hand.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.284
- Thank you, Chief.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.153
- You should have seen
her today.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.188

a distraction,

11:02.329 --> 11:05.098
but when that bell goes off...

11:05.132 --> 11:06.900
all business all day.

- Absolutely, Chief.

Hmm, yeah.

- I can't believe this.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.990
No warning?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.992
- It stinks on ice.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.195
- What does that mean?
- Extra stinky, like fish.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.330
- They can really just transfer
anyone at any time?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.333
- Everybody needs to take
a breath, all right?

11:40.367 --> 11:43.470
Boden's really passionate about
keeping his house together.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.973

He'll find a way.

I'm about to say, but...

12:39.492 --> 12:41.394
this transfer

could very well be
a blessing in disguise.

- How do you figure?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.271
- Well...

12:51.304 --> 12:54.141
Working in PR means

12:54.174 --> 12:56.543
you're the public face
of the CFD.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.545
So you could...

12:58.578 --> 13:02.149
speak up for issues
that are important to you.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.217
You know, women's issues,

13:04.251 --> 13:06.119

13:06.153 --> 13:10.390

never knew about us.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.394
- Mm.

on that roof today...

about was getting

13:31.411 --> 13:33.480
that mom and that baby
to safety.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.348
Nothing was gonna stop me.

You could have put 1,000 pounds
on my back,

13:37.985 --> 13:41.288
you could have turned
the fire up a million degrees

that save.

13:55.368 --> 13:59.239
- [exhales slowly]

14:00.273 --> 14:03.210
I climbed into a car
I shouldn't have.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.213
And the only reason
I climbed out

14:06.246 --> 14:09.349
was 'cause
of the CFD rescue squad.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.284
So I made a decision
in the hospital.

14:11.318 --> 14:15.522
I said, "I'm gonna lift people
out of bad places too."

a scene of it, you know.

This might be totally
not the time, but...

I was looking through the files
on Mrs. Donovan's desk,

14:59.132 --> 15:02.302
and it turns out that the money
allotted for the Spring Picnic

15:02.335 --> 15:03.603
was never used,

15:03.636 --> 15:06.406
which means that we have $900

15:06.439 --> 15:09.242
in the petty cash fund.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.278
I overheard you guys talking
the other day

barbecue grill.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.150

I could use
that money to get one.

of news so...

a little while

16:03.563 --> 16:05.732

by Connie,

again sometime.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.929
- [groaning] God.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.876
- Chief Huffhines...

21:16.909 --> 21:19.746
Just the man we came to see.
- Wallace.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.414
- I don't know if you know
Captain Matt Casey.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.082
- Uh-oh, you got looks
in your eyes

21:23.115 --> 21:24.717
like you want something.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.719
- [chuckles] That obvious, huh?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.488
- Like my wife when she wants
me to empty the cat litter.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.022
- [chuckles]
- Well, it's actually

21:30.056 --> 21:31.358
about the position
you're filling

21:31.391 --> 21:32.359
in Public Relations office--

21:32.392 --> 21:33.960
- Yes.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.895
Something I've been angling
for since last year.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.798
We need fresh blood
in the department.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.934
So much of what the city does
is stuck in 1974.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.870
- I understand that--
- Which is why I said,

21:43.903 --> 21:46.773
"We need a woman firefighter
front and center."

21:46.806 --> 21:49.075
My understanding is
that Montague...

21:49.108 --> 21:50.843
She's the real deal.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.379
- Excuse me,
did you say Montague?

21:52.412 --> 21:54.381
- Do you mean Stella Kidd?

21:54.414 --> 21:55.848
- Well, I saw a list of names.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.550
I wasn't sure who it was.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.419
I'm just glad it's happening.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.388
- I was under the impression
you asked for Stella Kidd

22:01.421 --> 22:03.055
personally.
- I did not.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.958
But I stopped trying
to figure out the, you know,

22:05.992 --> 22:09.028
machinations of the CFD
a long time ago.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.930
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,

22:10.963 --> 22:13.566
my son has a basketball
tournament in Bloomington.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
Is there anything else?

22:15.602 --> 22:18.004
- Good to see you, Dave.
- Wallace.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.106
Matt.

22:20.139 --> 22:23.109
[tense music]

22:23.142 --> 22:28.881
*

22:31.150 --> 22:34.387
[video game sound effects]

22:39.125 --> 22:41.394
- Hey.

22:41.428 --> 22:44.431
- Captain.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.133
- Matt Casey.
- No, I'm Manfredi.

22:47.166 --> 22:50.437
- No, I'm introducing myself.
I'm Matt Casey.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.171
- Captain.
- Right.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.973
- Got it.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.009
- Welcome to 51, Manfredi.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.045
- Sure am glad to be here.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.153
- We got a chowder-head
replacement for Kidd.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.988
- He asked me
where the bathroom was,

23:09.021 --> 23:11.891
and then he just stayed
right there.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.166
- All right.
- What's this?

23:20.199 --> 23:22.034
- Something I worked
on all weekend.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.170
Now I know what a shrewd
businessman you are, Herrmann,

23:24.203 --> 23:26.639
which is why I really wanted
to take the time

23:26.673 --> 23:28.908
put together
a proper strategic proposal.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.910
- Is this about
that bar closing?

23:30.943 --> 23:33.112
'Cause I already told you--
- It is. It is about that bar.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.048
But instead of closing...

23:36.082 --> 23:37.817
what if we partner with it?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.151
Hm?

23:39.185 --> 23:40.920
I know, I know,

23:40.953 --> 23:43.923
but just look at this chart
on page three.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.893
Go ahead, look at it.
Go ahead, go ahead.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.162
Now, we can drive lower cost
from our suppliers

23:50.196 --> 23:53.065
on beer, wine, spirits,
and supplies.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.102
We can amortize those costs
over two locations

23:56.135 --> 24:01.107
so that the entities combine
to create higher margins.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.242
Now, the cost outlay,
it's gonna be minimal

24:03.275 --> 24:05.211
because Mac's bar just need
a couple touch-ups.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.946
It doesn't need
a full overhaul.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.681
Not to mention,

24:08.715 --> 24:12.919
the money that we can save
by split-focus marketing.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.154
[clicks teeth]

24:15.187 --> 24:19.492
I call it "Molly's North."

24:19.526 --> 24:22.495
[gentle music]

24:22.529 --> 24:23.596
- Hmm.

24:23.630 --> 24:27.600
*

24:27.634 --> 24:29.068
- We'll think about it.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.005
- That's all I ask.

24:42.081 --> 24:46.085
Hey, it's not a done deal
yet, but, uh...

24:46.118 --> 24:48.120
I think I got them.
- Oh, my--

24:48.154 --> 24:50.523
Brian, thanks...

24:50.557 --> 24:52.191
- Yeah.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.694
- [laughs]
Hey.

24:55.695 --> 24:59.599
*

24:59.632 --> 25:01.067
- Uh...

25:01.100 --> 25:02.669
Tell your dad not to

25:02.702 --> 25:05.204
sell anything until I close it.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.106
Okay?
- Okay.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.941
Okay. Okay.
- All right.

25:08.975 --> 25:13.012
*

25:17.049 --> 25:19.952
- [chuckles]
Well, uh...

25:19.986 --> 25:21.621
I'm on probation at work.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.022
- [groans]

25:23.055 --> 25:24.557
- They're saying
that my attitude

25:24.591 --> 25:26.025
is a red flag for them.

25:26.058 --> 25:29.195
I--I don't even know
what that means.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.164
Uh, look.
Yeah...

25:32.198 --> 25:34.100
Um...

25:34.133 --> 25:36.268
If--if Matt
couldn't help me before

25:36.302 --> 25:38.204
I sure could
use his help right now--

25:38.237 --> 25:40.039
- Are you kidding me?
- No, no, I--I--

25:40.072 --> 25:41.674
I didn't.
- I told you

25:41.708 --> 25:43.209
that Matt was out of politics
and you still go

25:43.242 --> 25:44.711
to some alderman
and throw his name around?

25:44.744 --> 25:45.712
- No, sweetheart--
- No, Pop, no.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.246
You don't listen.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.781
You walk yourself
into these problem.

25:48.815 --> 25:49.782
You don't care
whose name you use

25:49.816 --> 25:51.117
or who says, "No."

25:51.150 --> 25:52.652
It's all a fair game as long as

25:52.685 --> 25:54.153
Ramon Dawson is gets
what he wants

25:54.186 --> 25:56.055
- No, I--
- No, I'm not playing around.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.324
You only think about yourself
and I'm sick of it.

25:58.357 --> 26:02.261
[tense music]

26:02.294 --> 26:04.130
[sighs]

26:04.163 --> 26:10.670
*

26:10.703 --> 26:13.039
- Okay.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.042
[soft dramatic music]

26:16.075 --> 26:17.343
*

26:17.376 --> 26:19.679
I understand.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.348
You're right.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.250
I, um...

26:24.283 --> 26:26.285
I'm sorry.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.254
Again.

26:42.635 --> 26:42.769
.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.871
[indistinct chatter]

26:48.374 --> 26:49.909
- Are you Stella Kidd?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.010
- Uh, that's me, yeah.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.812
- Topher.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.782
Let me show you where
you'll be hanging your hat.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.851
Main thing to know is
they monitor Internet use.

26:58.885 --> 27:01.921
I found that out the hard way.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.390
Let's see, we have morning
meetings Monday, Wednesday,

27:04.423 --> 27:06.092
and Friday to touch base
on talking points,

27:06.125 --> 27:09.095
key messages,
that type of thing.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.764
This is you.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.734
- Okay.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.869
- And I should warn you,
today's there's a, uh--

27:16.903 --> 27:18.404
- You the new girl?

27:18.437 --> 27:20.106
- Stella, yeah, that's me.
- Great.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.374
Come with me.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.343
Chief Huffhines,
what's your name again?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.345
- Stella Kidd.
- Kidd, like "kid?"

27:26.378 --> 27:28.080
- Well, yeah, two Ds.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.916
- Yeah, you're here to talk
about how good the CFD

27:29.949 --> 27:31.450
is with minorities, women,
that sort of thing.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.885
- Yeah, about that--

27:32.919 --> 27:34.153
- Now, don't lay it
on too thick,

27:34.186 --> 27:37.323
but sell it,
you know what I mean?

27:37.356 --> 27:40.026
Is that how
you're gonna wear your hair?

27:40.059 --> 27:44.731
- What?
- Down is better.

27:44.764 --> 27:48.768
- [stammering]

27:48.801 --> 27:51.437
- Yeah, great.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.940
Here we go.
[door opens]

27:58.510 --> 28:01.047
Gentlemen, ladies...

28:01.080 --> 28:03.182
Thanks for allowing
us the opportunity

28:03.215 --> 28:04.951
to set the record straight

28:04.984 --> 28:07.186
with regards to personnel here
at the CFD.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.822
This is Stella Kidd,

28:09.856 --> 28:12.792
a distinguished firefighter
with many years of service

28:12.825 --> 28:14.093
under her belt.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.762
She is eager to talk
to you today

28:15.795 --> 28:17.429
about the achievements
we've made

28:17.463 --> 28:19.899
with regards
to minorities and gender

28:19.932 --> 28:23.435
under
Fire Commissioner Jankowski.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.371
[camera flashes]

28:25.404 --> 28:27.840
[overlapping chatter]

28:27.874 --> 28:30.009
[tense music]

28:30.042 --> 28:33.145
*

28:33.179 --> 28:36.015
- Uh [chuckles nervously]

28:47.126 --> 28:49.461
- We never stopped
for ice cream on my last truck.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.963
We did get slushies once.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.765
I like cola and cherry mix.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.066
- Fascinating.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.835
- Hey, what's that?

28:55.868 --> 28:57.036
- Ta-da!
- Ah.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.805
- Whoa, that's a Weber Grill.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.406
- We were a little under
with the petty cash fund

29:00.439 --> 29:02.474
but this was the best one
so I just went for it.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.845
It's my gift to 51 for making
me feel so welcome.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.146
- [straining] Forget it.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.548
We'll all chip in,
that's how we do things.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.017
- I'll go get the tool box.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.019
- The lid goes on top.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.488
- So, uh, Manfredi.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.957
- Captain.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.859
- Where were you before 51?

29:19.892 --> 29:21.260
- Let's see, uh...

29:21.293 --> 29:23.996
Right before I was at 33.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.832
Then before that

29:25.865 --> 29:29.501
74, 59, 12, 41.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.537
- Wow, all over.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.205
- I just go where
the transfer paper tells me.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.974
- I'll bet.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.943
- I got this cop friend
over at CPD.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.178
He's got this uncle...

29:39.211 --> 29:40.913
bumps him to
the best districts.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.548
Totally hooks him up.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.551
Just signs the transfer forms
and phisssh.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.088
Kyle is set up.
High living.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.591
I don't have an uncle
like that.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.895
- Otis, radio me
if we get a call.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.130
Herrmann and I gonna run
an errand.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.266
- All right, yeah.
- You got it, Cap.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.068
[groans]

30:02.101 --> 30:04.036
- [giggles]

30:04.070 --> 30:06.105
[keyboard clicks]

30:06.138 --> 30:08.007
- Hey.
- Oh.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.009
Is that Christopher Herrmann
I see before me?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.543
Oh.
- Hey, Demetra.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.612
How are you?
- Oh, wonderful.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.147
Do you know that it was

30:15.181 --> 30:16.615
Christopher's
wonderful wife Cindy

30:16.648 --> 30:18.017
that helped me
get this job?

30:18.050 --> 30:19.318
We went to Notre Dame together.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.987
- I had heard that, yeah.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.154
Cindy's always bragging
about you.

30:22.188 --> 30:24.190
- Oh. What can I do for you?

30:24.223 --> 30:26.893
- Well, uh, we had a
firefighter transferred

30:26.926 --> 30:29.261
to Public Relations
out of Firehouse 51.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.530
I was just wondering if we can
see the transfer order?

30:31.563 --> 30:34.300
- Um, what was the
firefighter's name?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.568
- Stella Kidd.

30:39.238 --> 30:42.041
- Give me one minute.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.210
- I see
why you brought me along.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.278
- Go Irish.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.948
- Here we go.
- Thanks.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.516
- Sure.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.219
- Chief Mullins?

30:53.252 --> 30:54.620
- Is that
that by-the-book Chief

30:54.653 --> 30:55.888
that gave you
your promotion?

30:55.922 --> 30:57.323
- Yeah.
- Huh.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.526
He spent time around 51.
He's seen Kidd in action.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.661
Might be why he made the call.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.631
[suspenseful music]

31:05.664 --> 31:08.367
*

31:08.400 --> 31:10.169
Are you sure about this?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.938
Because he didn't seem to keen

31:11.971 --> 31:14.673
on having his decision
making questioned.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.144
*

31:18.177 --> 31:20.146
- Captain Casey.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.680
- Chief.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.216
- Can I help you
with something?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.665
- Hope.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.568
Mind stepping in here please?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.973
- Of course.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.010
- Captain Casey has something

31:51.043 --> 31:53.145
he would like to discuss
with you.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.215
- Sure.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.617
- Here's the transfer order
moving Stella Kidd

31:58.650 --> 32:00.286
from Firehouse 51

32:00.319 --> 32:02.154
to the Public Relations
department.

32:02.188 --> 32:05.391
It was signed by Chief Mullins.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.995
- Okay?

32:09.028 --> 32:11.197
- Only this isn't
his signature.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.134
See how the "M" tilts
to the right

32:15.167 --> 32:18.104
and the "S" has a flourish.

32:18.137 --> 32:21.040
- That's not the way
I sign my name.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.042
This is.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.278
[tense music]

32:26.312 --> 32:27.980
- However...

32:28.014 --> 32:29.415
Here's a list you wrote
to Connie

32:29.448 --> 32:31.617
about the supplies
and maintenance closet.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.720
See the "M" and the "S".

32:34.753 --> 32:38.690
*

32:38.724 --> 32:40.726
- I can see it.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.462
I mean, I could see how...

32:43.495 --> 32:46.065
That...

32:46.098 --> 32:48.300
Actually, yes, I should have
said something sooner,

32:48.334 --> 32:51.337
but Connie...

32:53.805 --> 32:56.742
I...

32:56.775 --> 33:00.246
I just didn't know who to come
to about something like this.

33:02.081 --> 33:03.749
[stammering]

33:03.782 --> 33:07.253
If you could just let me
explain before you judge me.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.293
What happened is...

33:14.326 --> 33:17.363
I saw the posting
on the job board,

33:17.396 --> 33:20.232
and I was actually
trying to help.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.101
Because Stella, I mean,

33:22.134 --> 33:24.070
she's such a strong
female firefighter,

33:24.103 --> 33:26.438
and I saw that Public Relations
was looking for somebody

33:26.472 --> 33:28.107
to be the face
of firefighting--

33:28.140 --> 33:30.409
- Stop.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.218
I'm gonna save everyone
here a lot of time.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.257
Empty your desk.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.458
- I went ahead
and sped this up for you.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.835
Mm-mm.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.204
I'll take those.

34:37.743 --> 34:43.782
*

34:52.291 --> 34:52.424
.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.092
[engine shuts off]

34:54.460 --> 34:56.128
- [sighs]

35:06.372 --> 35:08.507
- I am so, so,
so sorry, Sylvie.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.642
I really thought that I was
doing the right thing.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.411
I mean, women get a raw deal
in the fire department,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.180
you know that.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.447
And here I was trying
to do something about it,

35:15.481 --> 35:17.216
trying to actually
make a difference,

35:17.249 --> 35:19.385
and they twisted everything
that I did.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.653
Sylvie. You know me.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.323
You know that this was blown
completely out of proportion.

35:24.356 --> 35:26.258
I mean, I really think

35:26.292 --> 35:28.360
that Connie was trying to
sabotage me from the start

35:28.394 --> 35:30.262
if I'm being honest.
- How could you do this?

35:30.296 --> 35:31.897
You almost ruined everything
that I have worked for

35:31.930 --> 35:33.565
here in Chicago.
- That's what I'm saying.

35:33.599 --> 35:34.866
They made it look like--
- These people

35:34.900 --> 35:36.902
mean the world to me, Hope.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.870
These friends that I've made,
these friendships I've earned,

35:38.904 --> 35:41.240
they are the best,
most important relationships

35:41.273 --> 35:43.409
I've ever had,
and you attacked them.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.943
- That's not at all what--
- Hope.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.213
You had a chance
to have an incredible life

35:47.246 --> 35:49.615
with incredible friends,
working at the best firehouse

35:49.648 --> 35:51.517
in the city.
That's a fact.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.619
And you blew it.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.522
So take your excuses, take
your lies, take your drama,

35:56.555 --> 35:59.291
and take it all back
to Fowlerton.

35:59.325 --> 36:01.860
[somber music]

36:01.893 --> 36:04.196
- Sylvie.

36:11.703 --> 36:17.976
*

36:18.009 --> 36:21.247
- Hey, Mac, right?

36:21.280 --> 36:24.916
We're the owners
of Molly's bar, and, uh...

36:24.950 --> 36:27.453
We'd like to make you
a proposal.

36:28.920 --> 36:36.194
*

36:39.365 --> 36:40.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.401
- We get to carpool again.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.635
- I mean, we live together.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.604
We see each other all the time.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.973
- Yeah, but still, I like to
see you at the firehouse too.

36:48.006 --> 36:49.975
- Right.
- No, serious.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.544
You...bring a light to it.

36:52.578 --> 36:56.582
*

36:56.615 --> 36:59.017
And an odor.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.521
- [sighs] I know.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.291
Kid who makes fun of girl
on the playground

37:05.324 --> 37:07.493
actually really likes her.
- Mm-hmm.

37:07.526 --> 37:10.596
- Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.030
Yeah.
- Have you been there?

37:12.063 --> 37:13.632
- Yeah.
- It's good?

37:13.665 --> 37:15.033
- No, it's really good.
We went last...

37:15.066 --> 37:17.035
- Hey, there she is!

37:17.068 --> 37:19.638
both: Hey!
- Welcome back, Kidd.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.408
- You guys were jostling each
other for my locker already.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.276
Admit it.
- Cruz was.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.644
I said that was tacky.
- What?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.513
It has the best hinges.
- [chuckles]

37:27.546 --> 37:29.781
God, you guys.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.783
- What?
- Stop.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.385
- Because you got
the biggest hinges!

37:33.419 --> 37:35.454
- Stop it!

37:35.487 --> 37:37.623
[indistinct banter]

37:37.656 --> 37:39.525
[low indistinct conversation]

37:39.558 --> 37:41.793
- Okay, before I begin...

37:41.827 --> 37:44.796
Just want to say a big welcome
back to Stella Kidd

37:44.830 --> 37:47.399
from her short stint
of smiling at the camera.

37:47.433 --> 37:50.536
[cheers and applause]

37:53.004 --> 37:55.674
- All right!
[whistling]

37:56.808 --> 37:58.577
- It's good to have you
firefighting again.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.446
It's where you belong.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.415
- Thank you, Chief.
- Okay, today's assignments.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.684
- Chief.
- Yes, Sylvie?

38:05.717 --> 38:08.787
- I'd like to say a word
if that's okay.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.689
- Of course.

38:15.527 --> 38:19.798
- I just want to say that for
my part in bringing my friend,

38:19.831 --> 38:21.700
my former friend...

38:21.733 --> 38:24.570
to Firehouse 51...

38:24.603 --> 38:27.439
I am truly sorry.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.408
This place is special to me,

38:29.441 --> 38:32.444
and I would never knowingly
or willingly do anything

38:32.478 --> 38:36.081
to jeopardize what it is
that we have here.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.849
I love all of you,

38:37.883 --> 38:40.486
and I feel terrible
about what happened.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.489
[soft music]

38:43.522 --> 38:49.361
*

38:49.395 --> 38:51.062
[alarm sounds]

38:51.096 --> 38:52.764
- Ambulance 61,

38:52.798 --> 38:54.733
Man Down From Unknown Causes,
- Hey, that's us.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.768
- 33 North Wabash,
El Platform.

39:19.157 --> 39:22.394
[indistinct chatter]

39:24.095 --> 39:25.631
- Get down on the ground!

39:25.664 --> 39:27.433
Taser him! Taser him!
Taser him!

39:27.466 --> 39:29.468
- [grunts]
- Move along.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.637
- Hey, hey, what happened?
- A guy starts screaming

39:31.670 --> 39:33.672
at this woman for no reason,
brandishing a big-ass knife.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.106
Guy follows her,
yelling at her,

39:35.140 --> 39:36.775
spit flying out
of his mouth.

39:36.808 --> 39:37.876
Guy standing next to me
just went up to him

39:37.909 --> 39:39.110
and said, "That's enough."

39:39.144 --> 39:40.912
That's him right there.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.615
Crazy dude just stabbed him
like it was nothing.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.517
- Paramedics! All clear!

39:45.551 --> 39:48.153
*

39:48.186 --> 39:50.188
- [grunting]

39:50.221 --> 39:51.823
- Let's go!

39:53.592 --> 39:56.194
- [muffled groaning]

39:56.227 --> 39:57.696
- Don't move, sir.
Don't move.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.864
We got you.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.600
Ready?
Okay, turn him.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.671
Dad.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.806
[music intensifies]
