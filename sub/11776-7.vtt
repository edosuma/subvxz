{\an8}Lettering is a very
important part of tattooing

04:40.196 --> 04:42.281
{\an8}because a lot of tattoos
incorporate words.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.282

the spacing right,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.868
if your line thickness
is not right,

04:45.952 --> 04:48.705
if the word's not flowing well
with the rest of the design,

04:48.788 --> 04:52.125
it can totally cheapen
an otherwise good tattoo.

to be perfect.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.102
{\an8}he's incredibly respected
in the industry.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.270
{\an8}He's a legend.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.106
It's an honor to be part
of something with him really.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.524
Alright, let's go
check out this work.

08:45.608 --> 08:45.650
[Jack] Let's do it.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.110
Shane.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.321
I like how you've combined
some elements

08:50.404 --> 08:52.490
of lettering
with the flourishing

08:52.573 --> 08:55.451
on the bottom there
and the tube coming off the "I."

08:55.534 --> 08:58.371
It's graffiti, but it still
got these tattoo elements.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.122
You designed it
like a tattooer would.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.208
It's like a logo,
could have fit anywhere.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.293
Could be on a wall
or a train or a T. Shirt.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.544
Cleaned it up a lot, man.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.838
It was looking a little rough
when I first saw it, but--

09:07.922 --> 09:09.715
{\an5}-Yeah.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.715
-I really like how you

09:09.799 --> 09:12.885
finish it out with a thick,
beveled, double-line red

09:12.969 --> 09:14.637
and all the stuff
in the background.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.555
{\an8}It wasn't supposed
to look like a logo.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
I don't see
that it's that legible.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.976
It's kind of all over the place.

09:22.895 --> 09:23.604
[Dave] What's up, Josh?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
I think
out of all of them here,

09:25.606 --> 09:28.776
this for me
was the hardest to read.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.486
I always tried and I still do,

09:30.569 --> 09:32.989
always try to make stuff
legible.

09:33.072 --> 09:33.906
You went
a different direction

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
than I would have
picked for you.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.826
I just was expecting
a little more Josh-y,

09:36.909 --> 09:38.077
and this is like, super retro.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.162
Busting my balls.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.622
{\an8}What a terrible way
to start off.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.375
[man] What's up, Tommy?

09:44.458 --> 09:47.003
I like the clean,
crispy lines there.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.129
That looks like

09:48.212 --> 09:49.839
a real pro graffiti
style action.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.550
And the farther away you are,
the easier it is to read.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.176
{\an5}-Of course.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.176
-Now obviously...

09:54.260 --> 09:55.803
you have the graffiti
hand out of the bunch.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.722
Crisp, clean,
deliberate outlines.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.848
Thank you very much.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.516
After all the
[bleep]-talking and bragging

10:00.599 --> 10:02.143
{\an8}Tommy did about being
a veteran graffiti artist,

10:02.226 --> 10:03.602
I'm pretty unimpressed.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.814
It's flat. It looks like basic,
basic line work.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.569
[Dave] Mr. James Vaughn.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.363
I feel like I just
stepped out of a time capsule.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.032
The lettering is crazy.

10:16.115 --> 10:20.202
You used a small "i"
and a small "n" and a giant "K."

10:20.286 --> 10:22.705
This is like you just
ripped it off an old '70s train

10:22.788 --> 10:23.497
and slapped it on the wall.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.457
I definitely wanted
something

10:24.540 --> 10:25.374
you could see from a distance

10:25.458 --> 10:28.085
and know exactly what it meant.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.420
I actually liked it
a lot more

10:29.503 --> 10:31.881
before you had the black spots
in the letters.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.175
There's old school,
and then there's grade school.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.634
{\an8}and that looks like
a little kid did it.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.013
Alright, guys.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.348
So, Jack,
what are your thoughts?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.432
{\an5}-Who's your favorite?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.432
-Kind of leaning towards, uh,

10:41.515 --> 10:42.808
Mr. O'Neill there, you know,

10:42.892 --> 10:46.812
because I really like the fact
that his is really super clean.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.105
it looks
kind of like a logo.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
I think Josh's
is a little...

10:49.982 --> 10:50.941
[man] Too wonky?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.777
[Oliver] Yeah, it's a little bit
busy and wonky.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.528
I like Tommy's, man.
I mean...

10:54.612 --> 10:55.905
as far as technique,

10:55.988 --> 10:58.240
Tommy's definitely
more the writer of the bunch.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
His was right-on
and fast and...

11:00.534 --> 11:01.660
Tommy's just clean.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.912
It's a tricky call

11:02.995 --> 11:05.206
because Tommy's is very clean,
like you're pointing out,

11:05.289 --> 11:08.084
and Shane tied in
the whole tattooing element.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.251
But Tommy's
was more technically solid

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
'cause it was all line work.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
{\an5}-Let's call the winner.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
-Let's do it.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.096
Alright,
so for this challenge,

11:20.179 --> 11:22.181
we tested your lettering skills
with graffiti art.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.267
The one artist
that stood out today is...

11:28.104 --> 11:29.897
Shane.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.275
[applause]

11:33.359 --> 11:34.402
You really pulled it off,
man.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.779
I really like the style
of lettering that you did.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.572
You've got
a tattoo-style lettering.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.281
with the tube
coming off the "I,"

11:39.365 --> 11:40.449
it looks like a logo.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.867
As winner
of the Flash Challenge,

11:41.951 --> 11:45.121
you'll be given the first choice
in the human canvases

11:45.204 --> 11:47.039
for the Elimination Tattoo.
It's a huge advantage.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.625
We started at ten artists,
and now we're only down to four.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.920
And there's $100,000
on the line here.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.130
It's anybody's game
at this point.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.965
Unbelievable.

11:56.048 --> 11:56.924
{\an8}Tommy's graffiti wall

11:57.007 --> 11:58.426
{\an8}should have definitely
beat Shane's.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.303
It was just supposed to be
legible graffiti letters,

12:01.387 --> 12:03.055
and that's exactly
what Tommy did.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.432
Why don't you head on back
to the brownstone?

12:04.515 --> 12:05.850
Get ready
for the next challenge.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.976
{\an8}This is [bleep] [bleep].

12:07.059 --> 12:09.478
With what we were supposed to do
for the challenge,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.147
[bleep] he shouldn't have won
this piece.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.483
{\an8}[sighs] I'm really
frustrated about this tattoo.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.194
I really think
I'm going home tonight.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.863
It's just devastating
right now.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.322
The bottom line is,
I'm not easing up on anybody.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.366
This is you, brother.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.368
This is your chance
to make it or break it.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.870
You should've put
your foot down on this.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.792
♪

12:31.876 --> 12:34.211
{\an5}-[man] [sighs]

12:31.876 --> 12:34.211
-I'm going to wash up.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.754
I thought yours was awesome,
Shane.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.673
It looked like a damn logo
for, you know, a tattoo shop.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.968
This was a tattoo contest
doing graffiti.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.512
That's why I incorporated,
like, tattoo elements.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.182
The tattoo tube just popped
in my head at the last second.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.308
Obviously [bleep] happy
as [bleep] about it.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.476
Tommy's super pissed.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.187
{\an8}He feels screwed
on this one,

12:51.270 --> 12:53.856
{\an8}And I believe he got
the screwing as well.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.358
Apparently he's pretty
[bleep] pissed off about it.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.569
Getting competitive though.
He's supposed to be grouchy.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
{\an5}-Who's that?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
-You, man.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.822
We brought the grouchiness
out of you, man.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.949
What do you mean,
I'm grouchy? I'm all good.

13:04.033 --> 13:04.867
Should you have won that?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.619
No [bleep] way but I'm all good.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.703
Why... Why is that though?

13:07.786 --> 13:10.706
'Cause it was on legible,
clean lettering.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.041
Dude, it's [bleep]
three letters.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.083
Anybody can read it,
you know?

13:13.167 --> 13:13.626
It's not like
it's all whacked-out,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.127
three-dimensional.

13:16.003 --> 13:16.545
It's a competition.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.797
What are you gonna do?

13:18.881 --> 13:19.882
I thought the piece
was [bleep] cool, dude.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.801
It wasn't like...
It was a cheesy piece and I won.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
I thought it looked
[bleep] good, dude.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.263
Games are over.
Time for the real deal.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.683
[bleep] like they're gonna
cry about it.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.229
I didn't come here
to [bleep] make friends.

13:34.980 --> 13:40.277
[tattoo gun buzzes]

13:40.277 --> 13:42.238
You're all one step closer
to that 100 grand,

13:42.321 --> 13:43.239
the write-up in <i> Ink</i> magazine,

13:43.322 --> 13:45.574
And most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.494
For the next Elimination Tattoo,

13:48.577 --> 13:50.788
you'll be creating a portrait
on your human canvas.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.208
[bleep] it, man.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.417
{\an8}I can't believe
we're doing portraits.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.337
I did not see portrait coming.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.756
Portraits are very
personal tattoos.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.841
They allow no room
for mistakes.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.926
Oh, Lord.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.262
{\an8}I'll do portraits,
but I don't like to do them.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.721
It's going to depend
on the picture.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.515
The picture is everything
when it comes to this.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.724
And if you got a bad picture,

14:10.808 --> 14:12.184
it's not going to be
a good portrait.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.937
Portraits require
an amazing depth of detail.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.273
Your shading and blending skills
must be top-notch.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.441
{\an8}A good portrait?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
{\an8}I mean, obviously you've got
to catch the likeness.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.611
{\an8}You know, it has to look
like the person.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.446
Everything has to be
in the right spot.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.074
I'm thrilled
because it's what I'm known for.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.577
All these portraits...
will include lettering,

14:29.660 --> 14:32.830
so make sure your lettering
is as tight as your portrait.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.164
There's a very
limited number

14:34.248 --> 14:37.001
of tattooers that can actually
pull portraits off.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.961
{\an8}Some tattooers see things
in a portrait

14:39.044 --> 14:42.840
that they accentuate
that makes the portrait

14:42.923 --> 14:44.341
come to life on the skin.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.468
Not all tattooers
have that magic.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.261
It's fact.

14:47.344 --> 14:47.928
Well, let's meet
your canvases.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.308
I'm totally nervous
being that my fate

14:52.391 --> 14:53.601
is in my canvas' hands.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.977
The 100 grand on the line

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
and I gotta go off
of whatever crap picture

14:56.812 --> 14:59.315
this guy's probably
going to bring me.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.482
Robert wants a tattoo
of his daughter

15:00.566 --> 15:03.277
on his right forearm.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.946
This is Salvatore, and he would
like a tattoo of his mother

15:06.030 --> 15:07.239
on his right ribcage.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.992
{\an8}Ribs are so hard to tattoo.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.370
It's just a bad area
to try to get a portrait.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.873
If I get him, I'm gonna be
super bummed.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.749
This is Josh.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.499
He'd like a portrait
of his uncle

15:17.583 --> 15:19.710
on his right forearm.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.253
And finally we have Johanna,

15:21.337 --> 15:23.922
who would like a portrait
of her mother on her back.

15:24.006 --> 15:24.882
Alright, Shane.

15:24.965 --> 15:25.841
Because you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:25.924 --> 15:28.636
you get first pick
of the human canvases.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.429
Can I see your picture?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.015
I'm an expert
at portrait tattoos.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.308
They're my thing.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.934
{\an8}People come from all over
the world to get tattooed by me.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.353
Where do you wanna
put that again?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.646
Right on my forearm.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.480
I think the forearm

15:39.563 --> 15:41.315
is the best place
for a portrait.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.650
It's a flat piece of canvas.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.193
The skin type is really great.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.278
Can I see your picture
real fast?

15:52.117 --> 15:53.160
There you go.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.703
{\an8}I choose Robert
because his picture was

15:54.787 --> 15:57.956
{\an8}more difficult
than the other pictures.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.041
I didn't want
the judges thinking

15:59.124 --> 16:00.542
I was taking the easy way out.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.795
You couldn't really see the hair
too good in the picture.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.548
The teeth, the eyes,
everything is difficult to do.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.384
Shane didn't pick
the toughest portrait.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.760
{\an8}You can actually see
the details in the picture.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.930
He picked
the easiest portrait.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.306
The rest
of the human canvases

16:14.390 --> 16:16.767
will one by one pick up a skull
that has your names on it.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.186
The canvas that draws your name
will be your client.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.562
Come on up
and grab a skull there, man.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.399
Josh.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.484
I [bleep] knew it.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.153
I knew I was gonna get
the goddamn rib piece.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.197
{\an8}Sure as [bleep] my name
was on that skull.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.616
Tommy.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.201
James.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.913
Alright, guys, you have
the rest of the evening

16:37.996 --> 16:40.749
to talk with your human canvas
and come up with a design.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.377
Tomorrow, you'll have five hours
to do this tattoo.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.378
Good luck.

16:46.255 --> 16:46.880
Portraits encompass
everything

16:46.964 --> 16:49.425
we've worked to this point.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.344
{\an8}Great line work, shading,
technical precision,

16:52.428 --> 16:56.432
proportion, being able
to reproduce a photo undeniably.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.267
The main part of face
will be bam right there,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.017
and the name real cool
right there.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.103
Awesome.
That'll definitely work.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.607
The photo I got,
it's very grainy.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.942
{\an8}And it's from 1978.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.861
It has a lot of contrast
in it though.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.820
There's a lot of stuff
I can work with.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.281
I'm totally stressed
for time in this one

17:12.364 --> 17:14.616
because a portrait
is so demanding

17:14.700 --> 17:15.617
and because of the detail
put into it

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
and the smooth blends.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.537
It can't be that big

17:18.619 --> 17:20.247
'cause we're on
a time restraint,

17:20.329 --> 17:22.540
but... we'll do
as big as possible.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.461
And on top of it, we were handed
that we have to do lettering.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.421
I'll do this in, like, a...
a nice script for you.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.797
That's cool.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.466
I'll use some sort
of design work with the script

17:30.549 --> 17:32.092
to sort of blend into him and...

17:32.176 --> 17:33.510
Your discretion.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.970
It's gonna be hard
to fit it in there.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.682
I'm worried about putting...
putting it anywhere

17:38.766 --> 17:40.976
on the stomach or the ribs.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.644
<i>That means a huge, huge,</i>
<i>huge battle for me.</i>

17:42.728 --> 17:44.980
<i>I [bleep] knew it.</i>

17:45.063 --> 17:47.149
<i>I knew I was gonna get the ribs.</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:49.151
{\an8}Ribs are so hard to tattoo,

17:49.234 --> 17:50.944
{\an8}and when every little movement
you make

17:51.028 --> 17:53.655
changes the facial features
of a portrait.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.116
It's just a bad area
to try to get a portrait.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.327
I have to convince my client

17:58.410 --> 17:59.495
to pick
a different location, man.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.749
This is my last chance.
There's 100 grand on the line.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.169
I'm not letting my client
ruin those chances for me.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.631
What... What other spots
are you willing to get tattooed?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.550
I have nothing
on these areas, so...

18:13.634 --> 18:14.885
So your legs
are all filled up?

18:14.968 --> 18:17.012
No, not on my legs,
but I just... they're so huge.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.681
I don't want
to put anything on my legs.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.351
Anywhere where there's,
like, a flat... a flat surface

18:22.434 --> 18:23.101
that I could really work with.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.395
The outside calf
would be perfect

18:25.479 --> 18:26.605
just 'cause it's so flat.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.486
I mean, if it's, like, a...
really, like, an issue,

18:32.569 --> 18:34.655
we can do it.
we can do it on the leg.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.490
That would be
[bleep] awesome.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.617
We're gonna move
the tattoo to his leg.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.035
This is make it or break it.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.913
I'm either gonna pull it off
or pack my stuff and go home.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.665
We're good.
I appreciate it, man.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.251
About what era
was this taken?

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
{\an5}[Johanna] Sixties, seventies.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
-Yeah.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.588
Johanna wants a portrait
of her mother,

18:51.672 --> 18:54.049
{\an8}and it's so small.

18:54.132 --> 18:57.886
I mean, the actual photograph
of the face of her mother,

18:57.970 --> 18:58.971
you can't see anything.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.306
It's kind of fuzzy,
so I want to...

19:01.390 --> 19:04.017
I want to keep it about...
about this size.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.770
I'm very, very scared
about this one

19:06.854 --> 19:08.522
because I could go home

19:08.605 --> 19:10.107
over having a busted grill.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.609
when I couldn't even figure out
what it's doing.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.610
Wow!

19:13.694 --> 19:16.280
I can't see the hair,
can't see the fuzz.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
I can't see... I can't see
nothing in this picture.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.285
[Bleep].

19:28.417 --> 19:29.459
[man] I've been stressed
like crazy lately.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.421
Hell, yeah. it's getting
to that point where every...

19:32.504 --> 19:34.089
every day is way more stressful.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.633
I got one more to get through.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.844
Got to be harder with
[bleep] James and Tommy.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.720
I'm totally nervous.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.930
{\an8}I mean, the 100 grand
on the line,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.098
and I feel like
I've come to the challenge

19:43.182 --> 19:46.101
where the canvas
is just really [bleep] me.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.811
You're clearly gonna
beat James, you know?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.146
Yeah, I can do a portrait.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.190
{\an8}Josh and James...
They're not real portrait dudes.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.901
He has a somewhat
difficult photo to use.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.277
not a lot of detail in it,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.030
but I'm really confident
with that type of stuff.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.115
He's probably gonna have
a difficult time with it.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.783
James don't do any portraits
I don't think.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.451
James is sweating bullets.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.745
Yeah.
Who's he kidding?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.206
Morning, guys.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.667
It's time for you all
to push your skills to the limit

20:10.751 --> 20:14.129
and tattoo a portrait
on your human canvas.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.381
You have five hours
to complete this tattoo,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.091
And your time...

20:18.675 --> 20:19.593
starts now.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.472
{\an8}What we're testing
is your ability

20:23.555 --> 20:25.474
{\an8}to capture the likeness
of the person.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.391
What's gonna make it
recognizable

20:26.475 --> 20:28.810
is having just
the correct dimensions,

20:28.894 --> 20:31.313
so the shading around the eyes
and the nose and the lips...

20:31.396 --> 20:33.148
if that stuff isn't just right,

20:33.231 --> 20:34.232
the face isn't gonna be
the same shape.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.153
How's the leg?

20:38.236 --> 20:39.655
[man] Feels good, man.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.156
I'm just trying to get
through this lettering,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.158
so I can actually talk to you.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.078
It's the most nerve-racking day
in this entire competition.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.162
{\an8}I feel like it could be
make or break for me.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.873
I don't do a whole lot
of black and gray.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.750
It's definitely not my forte,

20:51.833 --> 20:53.543
but I feel like
I've come light years

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
beyond the last black and gray
tattoo I've done.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.467
Twenty minutes of
daydreaming has passed.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.305
I get lost in the head and start
daydreaming about [bleep].

21:05.389 --> 21:06.723
Today's style, like,
super smooth portrait

21:06.807 --> 21:08.809
black and gray tattoos.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.519
{\an8}They're super stressful
for some people,

21:10.602 --> 21:11.269
but it's relaxing to me.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.772
I just love duplicating images.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.692
Aside from my canvas passing out
and not letting me finish it,

21:16.775 --> 21:18.151
I'm clearly gonna
win this challenge.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.530
Shane of course gets
the perfect canvas.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.699
He got the best picture
out of all of us.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.866
He could've done it in color.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.618
Of course Shane
would pick black and gray.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.204
Heaven forbid he have
to whip out some colors.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.748
Alright, just a little bit.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.458
Try not to crease
'cause there's the hairs

21:33.542 --> 21:34.751
right in the crease.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.714
{\an8}I'm really frustrated
about this tattoo.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.757
I stayed up late
and worked on this portrait,

21:40.841 --> 21:43.343
trying to blow it up
and see some of the details,

21:43.427 --> 21:44.261
but you can't see anything.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.055
And I gotta put it
in a difficult spot?

21:47.139 --> 21:47.889
I mean, this is [bleep].

21:47.973 --> 21:49.683
[indistinct chatter]

21:51.184 --> 21:52.561
{\an8}James didn't talk his client

21:52.644 --> 21:54.062
{\an8}into putting it
on a better spot.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.188
{\an8}He should know better.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.024
that just puts a smile
on my face.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.734
I'm hoping James
is going home

21:58.817 --> 21:59.317
and I'll be safe.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.447
[Dave] Alright,
four hours to go.

22:04.114 --> 22:08.618
[tattoo guns buzzing]

22:08.702 --> 22:09.911
Hello, Mr. Jack Rudy.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.079
I'm having a little difficulty

22:11.163 --> 22:12.789
because there's
a lot of contrast,

22:12.873 --> 22:14.082
but the shading is very dark.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.292
{\an8}There's not much
of a gray scale to it.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.170
So I am a little concerned
with what judges ought to say.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.713
Pressure's on me right now.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.589
That's right, no pressure.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.050
Let me just get right in here
real...

22:23.133 --> 22:24.051
Oh, sorry.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.969
The most important part
of a portrait to me

22:26.053 --> 22:28.430
{\an8}is the accuracy of it.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.683
It's really being able
to capture that person...

22:31.767 --> 22:33.351
their expression, the look.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.228
you've really,
really gotta be careful,

22:35.312 --> 22:36.521
'cause one false move,

22:36.605 --> 22:38.940
and it just doesn't
really look like that person.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.736
{\an8}I believe I'm definitely
at a disadvantage.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.654
My picture is super difficult.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.616
It's a contrasting,
whited-out mess.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.992
Still going, still going.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.327
How you feeling?

22:50.410 --> 22:51.369
It's definitely
out of my element.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.330
There's obviously
a lot of different skills,

22:53.413 --> 22:55.749
a lot of different tricks
of the trade

22:55.832 --> 22:57.375
that are involved in getting
a portrait to look just right.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.628
And whoever doesn't have
those tricks,

22:59.711 --> 23:00.420
it's gonna show.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.755
That's two hours
to go, people.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.507
Two more.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.386
{\an8}I think that
there's a very limited number

23:08.470 --> 23:11.181
{\an8}of tattooers that can actually
pull portraits off.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.976
And if you do one eye,
one shape

23:15.060 --> 23:16.019
and the other eye
a different shape...

23:16.103 --> 23:19.189
If you mess the lips up,
the whole face changes.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.482
You can beat a portrait up
with one move.

23:22.275 --> 23:22.442
You're doing awesome, girl.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.488
She's not taking it very well

23:26.571 --> 23:28.949
{\an8}'cause she picked a spot
that was really bad.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.909
I mean, it's on the bottom
of her hip.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.870
All around it's not
a fun issue right now.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.331
I'm pretty scared
because I could go home tonight.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.499
Alright, one more hour.
That's four down.

23:43.839 --> 23:44.881
What's up, Shane?

23:44.965 --> 23:45.423
It's going well.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.008
Skin's pretty much

23:47.092 --> 23:48.218
how I expected it
to be for this spot.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.303
An extra two hours
would be awesome.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.013
Then I could relax,
you know what I mean?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.432
{\an8}Shane's done nothing
but black and gray.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.018
I haven't been able to just sit

23:57.102 --> 24:00.313
and do cartoons and colors
the entire time,

24:00.397 --> 24:02.566
and that's exactly
what Shane has done.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.109
{\an8}If Shane stuck
with the original picture

24:04.192 --> 24:05.193
and made the portrait color,

24:05.277 --> 24:06.695
i think it would've taken on
a whole new life.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.823
Instead he took the easy way out
and did black and gray.

24:09.906 --> 24:10.782
Being Ink Master
takes a lot more

24:10.866 --> 24:12.826
than just following
a comfortable route.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.579
Of course everyone
wants to be number one

24:15.662 --> 24:18.790
and have the best tattoo
and have the best piece here.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.625
It's a competitive thing.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.294
My tattoo is right up there
with Shane's,

24:22.377 --> 24:23.920
and I definitely have
a chance to win this.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.547
Shane can keep doing
black and gray.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.131
I'll just be the Ink Master.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.675
Fifteen minutes left.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.805
I'm tattooing
straight to the end.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.556
It's frustrating.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.766
It's going really, really slow.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.852
Twenty seconds.

no doubt in my hand

{\an8}This is something
that I don't do all the time.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.589

on top of this

25:07.672 --> 25:09.090
is gonna mean a lot.

who's going home?

25:53.677 --> 25:54.970

that's guaranteed, dude,

anybody's safe really.

that they're not used to doing.

changed some things

just 'cause of the picture.

This week we've been testing
your portrait skills.

We'll be looking
at your shading, detail,

26:43.601 --> 26:47.022
and how much your tattoo
looks like the picture.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.315

Out of all the portraits
available,

26:54.029 --> 26:55.196
you chose the child.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.740
I didn't want you to think
I was taking the easy way out.

26:56.823 --> 27:00.076
I felt like this one would shine
the most with her smile

27:00.160 --> 27:01.619
and the glitter in her eyes
and everything.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.621
And the hair was pretty crazy
to take on.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.750
I've done
a lot of child portraits myself,

27:06.833 --> 27:09.210
and ones with teeth
are without a doubt

27:09.294 --> 27:11.921
the most difficult
of children's portraits to do.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.841
It really, uh,
looks like the photograph.

27:14.924 --> 27:15.925
Really nice, accurate job.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.553
In the photo where
it was not a lot of contrast,

27:18.636 --> 27:21.222
not a lot of definition
to show the nose,

27:21.306 --> 27:24.225
you picked out just the right
amount of subtleness and grazed

27:24.309 --> 27:26.853
those little, soft details
that pull it together.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.397
In the photograph,
the light that's in her eyes

27:29.481 --> 27:31.733
is the reflection of the flash.

27:31.816 --> 27:32.817
The flash, yeah.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.569
And so you had to move that
and use your white

27:34.652 --> 27:37.238
in a different spot
to really make it

27:37.322 --> 27:38.031
appear lifelike.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.491
Awesome.
I'm glad you noticed.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.242
Amazing touch.
Yeah, man.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.078
You really pulled
the likeness together.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.246
You definitely have
the "less is more" approach.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.581
You did the name
and the portrait.

27:46.664 --> 27:49.501
Nothing more needed.
Great job, man.

Thank you.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.426
How are you feeling
about this piece?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.428
It was a tough one.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.806
The original picture
is actually, like, this big.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.183
The portrait
is not all that accurate

28:05.266 --> 28:06.518
to the photograph.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.852
Part of doing a portrait.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.523
is being able to see accurately
what's in the photo

28:11.606 --> 28:13.650
and translate that
into the tattoo.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.692
I don't consider myself
a portrait artist.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.570
You know, this is what the task
at hand was,

28:17.654 --> 28:19.364
and I just did my best.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.573
Where I think
you kind of lost it

28:20.657 --> 28:22.575
is you actually put some shading
in her nose,

28:22.659 --> 28:25.286
where in the photo,
there wasn't.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.413
It was more of a highlight
on the tip of her nose,

28:26.496 --> 28:28.623
and you kind of shaded it out,

28:28.706 --> 28:30.917
which effectively changes
the shape of her nose.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.338
The eyes look like they might be
just a slight different shape

28:35.422 --> 28:36.631
{\an5}-than they are in the photo.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.631
-Kind of in the picture

28:36.714 --> 28:37.924
a little.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.634
The lettering
that you did too,

28:39.717 --> 28:42.387
there's so much going on
around it all...

28:42.470 --> 28:44.139
all the flowers
and flourishing...

28:44.222 --> 28:45.515
and it makes it
very difficult to read

28:45.598 --> 28:48.059
even if you can read Spanish.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.060
I mean, I've learned
the hard way

28:49.144 --> 28:50.812
over the years
that sometimes less is more.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.567
Your line work is shaky
in this tattoo

28:55.650 --> 28:58.319
because you're in a shaky spot.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.321
The placement in this thing
beat the hell out of you,

29:00.405 --> 29:02.532
And I feel like that's
a little bit of self-inflicted

29:02.615 --> 29:04.868
because you allowed that
to happen to yourself.

29:04.951 --> 29:08.163
The fact of the matter
is where her face is,

29:08.246 --> 29:09.914
where it lands in that tattoo
is where her body

29:09.998 --> 29:13.668
that's very voluptuous
comes together and meets.

29:13.751 --> 29:16.671
So her face is almost on indent
of this girl's body.

29:16.754 --> 29:19.090
The bottom line
is I'm not easing up on anybody.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.008
for the stakes being this high,

29:20.091 --> 29:23.052
you put yourself
in a really tough spot

29:23.136 --> 29:25.013

29:28.141 --> 29:29.809

29:37.567 --> 29:38.860
{\an5}-What are your thoughts?

29:37.567 --> 29:38.860
-I dug it.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.236
You know, I was into the piece.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.071
Little bit of a dark picture
to work with,

29:42.155 --> 29:44.699
like, a little grainy, but I did
what I could with it.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.202
With a photo like this
being grainy and whatnot,

29:47.285 --> 29:48.661
and being from the era
that it was,

29:48.745 --> 29:51.539
this style that you tattooed it
is perfect.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.249
As far as the likeness
to the photo,

29:53.333 --> 29:54.209
it's dead-on, man.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.210
You got the detail in there
just right.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.212
And I love the fact

29:57.295 --> 29:58.087
that you weren't scared
to go with black

29:58.171 --> 30:00.381
and put the heavy shading
in there.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.341
This wasn't an incidence
where you needed

30:01.424 --> 30:02.467
super soft, delicate...

30:02.550 --> 30:05.553
it's an army-time war photo.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.055
It's got a vintage feel to it.

30:07.138 --> 30:07.972
The details in the buckles

30:08.056 --> 30:10.099
and all the highlights
and everything,

30:10.183 --> 30:11.976
that's the best part
of this tat, man.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.520
The lettering I like

30:13.603 --> 30:16.898
except it's too wide,
and it's hard to read

30:16.981 --> 30:19.817
because, like, see,
where the "P" starts on there

30:19.901 --> 30:21.986
and then where the "Y" is,
the "Y" is off.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.696
I mean, you've got to turn
someone's arm

30:23.780 --> 30:25.323
to see the whole name.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.784
I would've made
that more legible,

30:27.867 --> 30:30.828
and even a little smaller,
different style.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.205
I did the lettering
like it was

30:32.288 --> 30:33.706
just to be
a little more masculine.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.416
I like the white highlights
in it,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.085
but it's just
a little bit wide and...

30:37.168 --> 30:38.211
and just kind of hard
to read too

30:38.294 --> 30:41.339
because the shading
goes real close to it.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.591
Technically,
it's a really nice tattoo, man.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.593
And it took... took balls
to make it real dark.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.178
Thank you so much,
gentlemen.

You had a difficult photo
to work from, man,

30:58.856 --> 31:00.900
so you definitely
had a handicap on this.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.902
Yeah, man, it was a...
just a whited-out picture.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.030
With the whites of the eyes,
what you've done

31:06.114 --> 31:07.615
is you've done
what's in the picture.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.450
What I would've liked
to have seen

31:09.534 --> 31:12.954
is maybe make the eyes
look round and in the head.

31:13.037 --> 31:13.871
Because they are so blown out
in the photo

31:13.955 --> 31:16.833
that to fill it in
with white like that

31:16.916 --> 31:19.294
really flattened out
her expression.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.379
Unless there's
an actual highlight there,

31:21.462 --> 31:24.507
I would never put white
in the eyeball like that

31:24.591 --> 31:26.301
because it does tend
to flatten it out,

31:26.384 --> 31:28.761
and then plus it turns yellow
with age.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.388
The lettering I liked.

31:30.471 --> 31:32.724
It was more minimal
where less is more sometimes.

31:32.807 --> 31:37.103
I would've loved
to seen some hair detail.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.980
You have the shape
and the construction

31:39.063 --> 31:39.897
of the hair there
with the shading,

31:39.981 --> 31:41.399
but you didn't really
detail it out

31:41.482 --> 31:43.526
with any hairlines.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.153
Just a few touches
here and there

31:45.236 --> 31:48.448
of some thin lines
kind of make it look like hair.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.116
There's a definite trick
to hair that

31:50.199 --> 31:51.492
that guy standing
right back there

that'll change your life,
and it's so easy.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.830

[bleep] excuses, whatever.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.608
James, I feel like
they exaggerated

33:47.692 --> 33:49.444
bad remarks on you, dude.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.445
It was bad.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.280
You never know, man.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.407
Once again
I'm on the fire line with James.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.367
{\an8}I'm still confident in my tattoo

33:56.451 --> 33:57.785
{\an8}and not going home tonight.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.786
I think James is gonna
get [bleep].

33:58.870 --> 34:01.664
The critique.
Past performance.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.040
You know, I think you've shined
a couple times.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.626
They're probably gonna
bend you over

34:05.710 --> 34:06.878
when you go up there.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.465
Alright, guys.
let's talk about this.

34:10.547 --> 34:11.299
It's Josh and James.
I mean, this is it.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.467
This is coming down
to the wire.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.012
Last week, James
jacked up the face

34:16.094 --> 34:19.181
and put two right feet
on his pin-up and stayed.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.808
Now he's delivering
the portrait

34:20.891 --> 34:23.436
that looks least like the photo,
and he's gonna stay?

34:23.518 --> 34:25.438
That statement is...
is debatable to me.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.607
Like, compare this photo
to that photo

34:27.690 --> 34:29.984
{\an5}-and this photo to that photo.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.984
-It's an arguable point,

34:30.067 --> 34:31.777
but it's an argument
that you will lose.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.237
I definitely feel like

34:34.322 --> 34:36.199
overall this one
is a better tattoo.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.199
Really?

34:37.283 --> 34:39.409
I think there's features
that he did capture,

34:39.494 --> 34:40.453
and there's features
that he didn't capture.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.996
She's got two different
shape eyes in the photo.

34:42.079 --> 34:45.333
One's coming in to a point,
and one's rounded.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.501
The right side's rounded.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.168
The left side comes down
into an actual point.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.339
The nose is where he lost it
the most for me.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.380
And the shape of the hair...

34:52.465 --> 34:54.592
The overall shape
of the top of the hair.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.970
I would've tried
to really focus on her

34:58.054 --> 34:59.013
and do her bigger.

34:59.096 --> 35:00.807
He could've eliminated
all this other stuff

35:00.890 --> 35:02.350
that was
very time-consuming

35:02.433 --> 35:04.519
and probably done
a much better job.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.020
He handicapped himself
unnecessarily.

35:06.103 --> 35:09.524
What sucks a little bit
about this is that

35:09.607 --> 35:11.359
he knows some of the tricks.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.652
He knows some of the ways

35:12.735 --> 35:14.403
to get the effects
that are necessary

35:14.487 --> 35:15.238
in different texture areas,

35:15.321 --> 35:17.532
and he just didn't
pull them off.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.825
And I will say this,
Josh had the foresight

35:18.908 --> 35:21.702
to get this guy off the ribcage.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.538
Her face is more accurate.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.498
It looks like the guy's mom.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.624
[Oliver] Not the eyes though.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.377
[Chris] The right retina
is bigger than the left.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.294
[Oliver] That's what I'm saying.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.254
They're different shapes,

35:31.337 --> 35:32.630
but they're not
the same two shapes.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.883
Her upper lip isn't the same
on both sides in the photo.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.301
[Dave] The mouth is wider too.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.596
I think the nose and mouth
on this one look like the photo.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.558
The rest of it, I...
I feel like it's a wash.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.977
The eyes and the hair
kill it so bad for me.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.270
Yeah, looks like
she's wearing

35:47.353 --> 35:49.063
the veil instead of hair.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.565
I can't vote
for this one, man.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.900
Now when it comes to color,

35:52.984 --> 35:55.236
Josh bangs color,
and I'm in his corner.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.071
But this is a nightmare to me.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.906
I'll say in James' defense

35:58.990 --> 36:01.826
there's way more
three dimensions happening.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.245
He knows tricks,
and what bothers me about him

36:04.328 --> 36:05.496
is that he couldn't beat the kid

36:05.580 --> 36:07.874
that doesn't know the tricks
outright convincingly.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.000
{\an5}-Yeah.
