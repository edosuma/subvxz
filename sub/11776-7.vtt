Tommy is making
a run for it.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.443
I'm just gonna have to teach him
a lesson this next challenge.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.527
This week
you'll be designing

00:27.610 --> 00:28.778
a piece that contains

00:28.862 --> 00:31.531
large breasts, thin waist,
and wide hips.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.616
I'm talking
about pinup girls.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.121

I don't know if you guys
are just beat up or what,

00:40.373 --> 00:42.792
but this week's tattoos
look like we're back

00:42.876 --> 00:44.961
in the beginning again.

00:45.044 --> 00:48.631
[narrator] <i> The artists faced</i>
<i>their toughest elimination yet.</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:51.134
This is to find out
who's the most well-rounded.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.385
You know what you came to do,
and you guys aren't doing it.

00:52.469 --> 00:56.097
[narrator] <i> Tommy, James, and Lea</i>
<i>were the bottom three.</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:58.016
[Chris] Tommy,
your face to me...

00:58.099 --> 01:00.602
she looks like she's just been
in a prize fight.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.352
[Dave] Lea.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.313
I cannot believe
her left hand.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.397
Jesus, it looks like

01:05.482 --> 01:08.359
she just pulled it
out of the garbage disposal.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.653
I'm not even sure
which finger is which.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.363
This is a disaster.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.657
James.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.035
{\an5}-This girl's got two right feet.

-What?

01:17.118 --> 01:20.455
[Oliver] She's got
two right feet.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.372
I didn't [bleep] it up
too bad.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.999
[Oliver] You lost it
in the mouth, man.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.542
The shape of that top lip
and this teeth, man,

01:24.626 --> 01:27.003
it's just scary-looking.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.548
All of you guys have
pretty much been hanging.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.050
Lea, you've been erratic.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.176
You don't have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.680
[narrator] <i> Four artists remain,</i>

01:37.764 --> 01:41.643

02:29.649 --> 02:31.234
[man] They gave you
a [bleep] free pass, dude?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.155
They didn't even bring up
two feet anywhere?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.114
They didn't really
say anything.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.198
{\an5}-[man] Come on.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.198
-[Shane] Man,

02:37.282 --> 02:38.908
that's twice
you went up there now.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.034
Can't win them all.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.619
As a competitor,
I'd like to see

02:41.703 --> 02:43.246
{\an8}James go home
'cause he can get

02:43.329 --> 02:45.665
really impressive [bleep]
done fast.

02:45.748 --> 02:46.666
That $100,000
is a big chunk of change

02:46.749 --> 02:48.877
that belongs to me.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.461
They might as well write my name
on a check right now.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.796
Did you really think
you had a chance of leaving?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.924
If you're there,
you never know.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.217
Such a relief.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.511
That's it.
It's just us four.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.436
Don't you guys all feel like

03:06.519 --> 03:08.855
the final four are the people
that should be here?

03:08.938 --> 03:11.024
{\an8}I've busted my ass to get here.
I feel like I deserve it.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.275
I've worked really hard
to be where I am.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.403
We'll see very soon
who the three are gonna be.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.405
It'll be sad to see
one of you guys go,

03:17.488 --> 03:18.781
but it's only
two more days for you.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.366
That cocky [bleep].

03:20.450 --> 03:22.744
{\an8}If Shane doesn't show the judges
some serious color work

03:22.827 --> 03:24.954
{\an8}or something different,
I'm gonna grab that top spot.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.164
I can't wait to see my kids.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.540
Y'all can go, man.

with a bunch of spray cans.

<i>I'll be able to conquer</i>

03:54.400 --> 03:55.652
<i>this challenge pretty easy.</i>

03:55.735 --> 03:57.695
[Bleep], man.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.405
Like, I've never touched
a spray can before.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.325
{\an8}So I'm about to get my ass
handed to me in graffiti.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.242
Welcome, everybody.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.620
You've made it
to the final four.

04:05.703 --> 04:06.746
You've been through a lot,

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
and I know that the critiques
have been rough.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.457
You're competing
for 100 grand,

04:09.540 --> 04:12.835
and you're gonna do something
that's on somebody forever.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.836
[Oliver] I want to see
somebody shine.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.964
I want to see a star.
I haven't seen it.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.966
It's definitely not
getting any easier.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.718
For one of you,
it'll be all worth it

04:20.802 --> 04:22.345
when you earn that $100,000,

04:22.428 --> 04:23.680
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine.

04:23.763 --> 04:28.393
And more importantly,
the coveted title of <i> Ink Maste</i> .

04:28.476 --> 04:30.019
As always, we kick things off
with the <i> Flash Challenge</i> .

04:30.103 --> 04:33.231
This week we're focusing
on lettering.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.108
A tattoo's lettering
often enhances

04:35.191 --> 04:36.317
the attitude and style
of the piece.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.113
{\an8}Lettering is a very
important part of tattooing

04:40.196 --> 04:42.281
{\an8}because a lot of tattoos
incorporate words.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.282
If you don't have
the spacing right,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.868
if your line thickness
is not right,

04:45.952 --> 04:48.705
if the word's not flowing well
with the rest of the design,

04:48.788 --> 04:52.125
it can totally cheapen
an otherwise good tattoo.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.545
Today, your job is to create
a design using the word "ink"

04:55.628 --> 04:56.796
on one of these walls.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.214
Lettering in tattooing,
you gotta do it crisp,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.216
{\an8}legible, and it's got
to be perfect.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.885
It can make
or break a tattoo.

05:02.969 --> 05:03.886
You'll only be
allowed to use

05:03.970 --> 05:04.721
black, red, and white.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.264
And you'll be judged
on lettering,

05:06.347 --> 05:08.016
creativity, line,
and readability.

05:08.099 --> 05:11.185
{\an8}I'm clearly losing this...

05:11.269 --> 05:12.895
{\an8}I don't even stand a chance
at this challenge.

05:12.979 --> 05:13.938
You have two hours
to do this.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.607
And your time starts... now.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.359
Go get 'em.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.614
{\an8}Lettering in tattoos
should be stylish but legible.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.533
To make something
that has lettering

05:25.616 --> 05:27.326
flow really nice on the body

05:27.410 --> 05:29.412
really requires a lot more
than just your average Joe

05:29.495 --> 05:30.371
trying to slap some [bleep]
on the back of your neck.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.750
[Tommy] [bleep] tired, huh?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.376
[James] How you doing
over there, Tommy?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.252
Feeling good. How you doing?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.670
This competition's
been really hard.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.756
{\an8}It's exhausting.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.840
I gotta focus.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.175
I want to get to the final three

05:42.258 --> 05:43.134
and see where I stack up.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.428
Feel like
I'm an embarrassment

05:45.511 --> 05:46.596
to goddamn graffiti.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.430
You should be wearing
a mask.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.015
{\an8}I do think
I have an advantage.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.475
I don't think anybody's even

05:50.558 --> 05:52.852
tried spray painting before.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.020
I'm putting my letters
on diagonally.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.396
This way I fill up the wall.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.273
I need to, like,
have more room for them

05:57.356 --> 05:59.609
to make the letters
more legible.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.028
It's one hour down.
Halfway point, guys.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.198
I just [bleep] that up.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.784
{\an8}Right away, I don't have a grasp
of how to do this [bleep].

06:07.867 --> 06:10.203
<i>Figure out which number</i>
<i>is the skinny one.</i>

06:10.286 --> 06:11.829
<i>I can't figure out</i>
<i>what caps to use.</i>

06:11.913 --> 06:13.456
There's tight caps,
and there's caps that spray,

06:13.539 --> 06:15.166
like, a large pattern.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.960
Come on. What the [bleep]?

06:18.044 --> 06:20.129
[bleep] things
keep clogging up, dude.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.173
Shane's piece
is starting out pretty weak.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.299
{\an8}I know he's never done this.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.468
Hopefully, he'll crash
and burn on this one.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.766
Uh-oh, now Tommy's
getting crafty.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.268
{\an8}I had a terrible hiccup
at that last pinup elimination.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.478
<i>She looks like</i>
<i>she's just been</i>

06:35.561 --> 06:36.646
<i>in a prize fight.</i>

06:36.729 --> 06:37.855
<i>This wasn't you today.</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:39.023
<i>I guess I fell short.</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:40.983
Now it kind of got me
screwed up a little bit,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.568
and I gotta try to keep
a positive head.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.736
I gotta really conquer this.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.488
[man] He's getting high as hell.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.241
{\an8}I'm just trying to learn
really fast as I go along.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.243
It's gonna be judged
on crisp lettering

06:50.326 --> 06:51.828
and crisp edges and stuff.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.538
And with a spray can,
it's difficult.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.706
Fifteen minutes, guys.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.293
[Oliver] Look at [bleep] Josh

06:59.377 --> 07:00.753
getting the bubbles
in there, dude.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.838
[Chris] The lettering's weak.

07:01.921 --> 07:02.505
Look at Shane.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.340
Shane's going for it, dude.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.800
Almost looks like
I know what I'm doing.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.469
Glad you know
what the hell you're doing.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.428
Mm-hmm.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.013
Yeah, Tommy's definitely
used to painting.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.182
He just whooped that line up.
Look at that thing. Whap!

07:13.266 --> 07:14.183
Square perfect.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.439
[Dave] One minute remaining.

07:20.523 --> 07:25.027
[suspenseful music]

07:25.111 --> 07:28.656
â™ª

07:28.739 --> 07:31.826
That's it, gentlemen.
Time's up. No more paint.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.036
I'm happy with it, man.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.204
Two hours.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.414
{\an8}I have a good opportunity
to win this

07:36.497 --> 07:38.541
because my stuff came out
very legible and clean.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.335
I am back, and I'm psyched.
I'm gonna rip it up.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.545
I know you thought

07:42.628 --> 07:44.172
it was just the three of us
who were judging you,

07:44.255 --> 07:47.508
but this week, we have a very
special surprise guest judge.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.844
This man is a true legend
in the tattoo world.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.555
He built his
first tattoo machine at age 17

07:52.638 --> 07:54.056
from his father's
electric razor.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.434
He's a trailblazer in lettering,

07:56.517 --> 07:58.477
portrait, and black
and gray tattoos.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.647
Just about every tattoo artist
working today can trace

08:01.731 --> 08:03.482
some of their technique
back to this man.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.029
Jack Rudy.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.947
[applause]

08:10.031 --> 08:10.489
Oh, [bleep].

08:13.576 --> 08:16.871
{\an8}I've been tattooing
for 36 years professionally.

08:16.954 --> 08:20.082
I co-invented the single needle
for professional tattooing.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
I had no idea

08:21.667 --> 08:23.794
the impact it was gonna have
on the business.

08:23.878 --> 08:27.715
Single-needle technique creates
the finest lines possible

08:27.798 --> 08:29.091
when done correctly.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.009
There he is.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.344
Oh, [bleep], man.

08:31.427 --> 08:32.970
{\an8}Jack Rudy's actually
an idol of mine

08:33.054 --> 08:34.096
{\an8}since I started tattooing.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.264
This is the one judge

08:35.347 --> 08:37.475
where I may find myself
starstruck.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.184
Jack being part
of the competition, I mean,

08:39.268 --> 08:41.102
{\an8}he's incredibly respected
in the industry.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.270
{\an8}He's a legend.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.106
It's an honor to be part
of something with him really.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.524
Alright, let's go
check out this work.

08:45.608 --> 08:45.650
[Jack] Let's do it.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.110
Shane.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.321
I like how you've combined
some elements

08:50.404 --> 08:52.490
of lettering
with the flourishing

08:52.573 --> 08:55.451
on the bottom there
and the tube coming off the "I."

08:55.534 --> 08:58.371
It's graffiti, but it still
got these tattoo elements.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.122
You designed it
like a tattooer would.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.208
It's like a logo,
could have fit anywhere.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.293
Could be on a wall
or a train or a T. Shirt.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.544
Cleaned it up a lot, man.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.838
It was looking a little rough
when I first saw it, but--

09:07.922 --> 09:09.715
{\an5}-Yeah.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.715
-I really like how you

09:09.799 --> 09:12.885
finish it out with a thick,
beveled, double-line red

09:12.969 --> 09:14.637
and all the stuff
in the background.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.555
{\an8}It wasn't supposed
to look like a logo.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.432
I don't see
that it's that legible.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.976
It's kind of all over the place.

09:22.895 --> 09:23.604
[Dave] What's up, Josh?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.523
I think
out of all of them here,

09:25.606 --> 09:28.776
this for me
was the hardest to read.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.486
I always tried and I still do,

09:30.569 --> 09:32.989
always try to make stuff
legible.

09:33.072 --> 09:33.906
You went
a different direction

09:33.990 --> 09:35.032
than I would have
picked for you.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.826
I just was expecting
a little more Josh-y,

09:36.909 --> 09:38.077
and this is like, super retro.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.162
Busting my balls.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.622
{\an8}What a terrible way
to start off.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.375
[man] What's up, Tommy?

09:44.458 --> 09:47.003
I like the clean,
crispy lines there.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.129
That looks like

09:48.212 --> 09:49.839
a real pro graffiti
style action.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.550
And the farther away you are,
the easier it is to read.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.176
{\an5}-Of course.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.176
-Now obviously...

09:54.260 --> 09:55.803
you have the graffiti
hand out of the bunch.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.722
Crisp, clean,
deliberate outlines.

09:57.805 --> 09:58.848
Thank you very much.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.516
After all the
[bleep]-talking and bragging

10:00.599 --> 10:02.143
{\an8}Tommy did about being
a veteran graffiti artist,

10:02.226 --> 10:03.602
I'm pretty unimpressed.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.814
It's flat. It looks like basic,
basic line work.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.569
[Dave] Mr. James Vaughn.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.363
I feel like I just
stepped out of a time capsule.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.032
The lettering is crazy.

10:16.115 --> 10:20.202
You used a small "i"
and a small "n" and a giant "K."

10:20.286 --> 10:22.705
This is like you just
ripped it off an old '70s train

10:22.788 --> 10:23.497
and slapped it on the wall.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.457
I definitely wanted
something

10:24.540 --> 10:25.374
you could see from a distance

10:25.458 --> 10:28.085
and know exactly what it meant.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.420
I actually liked it
a lot more

10:29.503 --> 10:31.881
before you had the black spots
in the letters.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.175
There's old school,
and then there's grade school.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.634
{\an8}and that looks like
a little kid did it.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.013
Alright, guys.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.348
So, Jack,
what are your thoughts?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.432
{\an5}-Who's your favorite?

10:40.431 --> 10:41.432
-Kind of leaning towards, uh,

10:41.515 --> 10:42.808
Mr. O'Neill there, you know,

10:42.892 --> 10:46.812
because I really like the fact
that his is really super clean.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.105
it looks
kind of like a logo.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
I think Josh's
is a little...

10:49.982 --> 10:50.941
[man] Too wonky?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.777
[Oliver] Yeah, it's a little bit
busy and wonky.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.528
I like Tommy's, man.
I mean...

10:54.612 --> 10:55.905
as far as technique,

10:55.988 --> 10:58.240
Tommy's definitely
more the writer of the bunch.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.451
His was right-on
and fast and...

11:00.534 --> 11:01.660
Tommy's just clean.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.912
It's a tricky call

11:02.995 --> 11:05.206
because Tommy's is very clean,
like you're pointing out,

11:05.289 --> 11:08.084
and Shane tied in
the whole tattooing element.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.251
But Tommy's
was more technically solid

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
'cause it was all line work.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
{\an5}-Let's call the winner.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
-Let's do it.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.096
Alright,
so for this challenge,

11:20.179 --> 11:22.181
we tested your lettering skills
with graffiti art.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.267
The one artist
that stood out today is...

11:28.104 --> 11:29.897
Shane.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.275
[applause]

11:33.359 --> 11:34.402
You really pulled it off,
man.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.779
I really like the style
of lettering that you did.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.572
You've got
a tattoo-style lettering.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.281
with the tube
coming off the "I,"

11:39.365 --> 11:40.449
it looks like a logo.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.867
As winner
of the Flash Challenge,

11:41.951 --> 11:45.121
you'll be given the first choice
in the human canvases

11:45.204 --> 11:47.039
for the Elimination Tattoo.
It's a huge advantage.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.625
We started at ten artists,
and now we're only down to four.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.920
And there's $100,000
on the line here.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.130
It's anybody's game
at this point.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.965
Unbelievable.

11:56.048 --> 11:56.924
{\an8}Tommy's graffiti wall

11:57.007 --> 11:58.426
{\an8}should have definitely
beat Shane's.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.303
It was just supposed to be
legible graffiti letters,

12:01.387 --> 12:03.055
and that's exactly
what Tommy did.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.432
Why don't you head on back
to the brownstone?

12:04.515 --> 12:05.850
Get ready
for the next challenge.

12:05.933 --> 12:06.976
{\an8}This is [bleep] [bleep].

12:07.059 --> 12:09.478
With what we were supposed to do
for the challenge,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.147
[bleep] he shouldn't have won
this piece.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.483
{\an8}[sighs] I'm really
frustrated about this tattoo.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.194
I really think
I'm going home tonight.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.863
It's just devastating
right now.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.322
The bottom line is,
I'm not easing up on anybody.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.366
This is you, brother.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.368
This is your chance
to make it or break it.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.870
You should've put
your foot down on this.

12:27.329 --> 12:31.792
â™ª

12:31.876 --> 12:34.211
{\an5}-[man] [sighs]

12:31.876 --> 12:34.211
-I'm going to wash up.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.754
I thought yours was awesome,
Shane.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.673
It looked like a damn logo
for, you know, a tattoo shop.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.968
This was a tattoo contest
doing graffiti.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.512
That's why I incorporated,
like, tattoo elements.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.182
The tattoo tube just popped
in my head at the last second.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.308
Obviously [bleep] happy
as [bleep] about it.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.476
Tommy's super pissed.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.187
{\an8}He feels screwed
on this one,

12:51.270 --> 12:53.856
{\an8}And I believe he got
the screwing as well.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.358
Apparently he's pretty
[bleep] pissed off about it.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.569
Getting competitive though.
He's supposed to be grouchy.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
{\an5}-Who's that?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.112
-You, man.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.822
We brought the grouchiness
out of you, man.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.949
What do you mean,
I'm grouchy? I'm all good.

13:04.033 --> 13:04.867
Should you have won that?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.619
No [bleep] way but I'm all good.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.703
Why... Why is that though?

13:07.786 --> 13:10.706
'Cause it was on legible,
clean lettering.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.041
Dude, it's [bleep]
three letters.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.083
Anybody can read it,
you know?

13:13.167 --> 13:13.626
It's not like
it's all whacked-out,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.127
three-dimensional.

13:16.003 --> 13:16.545
It's a competition.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.797
What are you gonna do?

13:18.881 --> 13:19.882
I thought the piece
was [bleep] cool, dude.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.801
It wasn't like...
It was a cheesy piece and I won.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
I thought it looked
[bleep] good, dude.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.263
Games are over.
Time for the real deal.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.683
[bleep] like they're gonna
cry about it.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.229
I didn't come here
to [bleep] make friends.

13:34.980 --> 13:40.277
[tattoo gun buzzes]

13:40.277 --> 13:42.238
You're all one step closer
to that 100 grand,

13:42.321 --> 13:43.239
the write-up in <i> Ink</i> magazine,

13:43.322 --> 13:45.574
And most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.494
For the next Elimination Tattoo,

13:48.577 --> 13:50.788
you'll be creating a portrait
on your human canvas.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.208
[bleep] it, man.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.417
{\an8}I can't believe
we're doing portraits.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.337
I did not see portrait coming.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.756
Portraits are very
personal tattoos.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.841
They allow no room
for mistakes.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.926
Oh, Lord.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.262
{\an8}I'll do portraits,
but I don't like to do them.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.721
It's going to depend
on the picture.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.515
The picture is everything
when it comes to this.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.724
And if you got a bad picture,

14:10.808 --> 14:12.184
it's not going to be
a good portrait.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.937
Portraits require
an amazing depth of detail.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.273
Your shading and blending skills
must be top-notch.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.441
{\an8}A good portrait?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
{\an8}I mean, obviously you've got
to catch the likeness.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.611
{\an8}You know, it has to look
like the person.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.446
Everything has to be
in the right spot.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.074
I'm thrilled
because it's what I'm known for.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.577
All these portraits...
will include lettering,

14:29.660 --> 14:32.830
so make sure your lettering
is as tight as your portrait.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.164
There's a very
limited number

14:34.248 --> 14:37.001
of tattooers that can actually
pull portraits off.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.961
{\an8}Some tattooers see things
in a portrait

14:39.044 --> 14:42.840
that they accentuate
that makes the portrait

14:42.923 --> 14:44.341
come to life on the skin.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.468
Not all tattooers
have that magic.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.261
It's fact.

14:47.344 --> 14:47.928
Well, let's meet
your canvases.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.308
I'm totally nervous
being that my fate

14:52.391 --> 14:53.601
is in my canvas' hands.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.977
The 100 grand on the line

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
and I gotta go off
of whatever crap picture

14:56.812 --> 14:59.315
this guy's probably
going to bring me.

14:59.398 --> 15:00.482
Robert wants a tattoo
of his daughter

15:00.566 --> 15:03.277
on his right forearm.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.946
This is Salvatore, and he would
like a tattoo of his mother

15:06.030 --> 15:07.239
on his right ribcage.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.992
{\an8}Ribs are so hard to tattoo.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.370
It's just a bad area
to try to get a portrait.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.873
If I get him, I'm gonna be
super bummed.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.749
This is Josh.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.499
He'd like a portrait
of his uncle

15:17.583 --> 15:19.710
on his right forearm.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.253
And finally we have Johanna,

15:21.337 --> 15:23.922
who would like a portrait
of her mother on her back.

15:24.006 --> 15:24.882
Alright, Shane.

15:24.965 --> 15:25.841
Because you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:25.924 --> 15:28.636
you get first pick
of the human canvases.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.429
Can I see your picture?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.015
I'm an expert
at portrait tattoos.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.308
They're my thing.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.934
{\an8}People come from all over
the world to get tattooed by me.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.353
Where do you wanna
put that again?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.646
Right on my forearm.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.480
I think the forearm

15:39.563 --> 15:41.315
is the best place
for a portrait.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.650
It's a flat piece of canvas.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.193
The skin type is really great.

15:45.486 --> 15:46.278
Can I see your picture
real fast?

15:52.117 --> 15:53.160
There you go.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.703
{\an8}I choose Robert
because his picture was

15:54.787 --> 15:57.956
{\an8}more difficult
than the other pictures.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.041
I didn't want
the judges thinking

15:59.124 --> 16:00.542
I was taking the easy way out.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.795
You couldn't really see the hair
too good in the picture.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.548
The teeth, the eyes,
everything is difficult to do.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.384
Shane didn't pick
the toughest portrait.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.760
{\an8}You can actually see
the details in the picture.

16:09.843 --> 16:12.930
He picked
the easiest portrait.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.306
The rest
of the human canvases

16:14.390 --> 16:16.767
will one by one pick up a skull
that has your names on it.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.186
The canvas that draws your name
will be your client.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.562
Come on up
and grab a skull there, man.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.399
Josh.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.484
I [bleep] knew it.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.153
I knew I was gonna get
the goddamn rib piece.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.197
{\an8}Sure as [bleep] my name
was on that skull.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.616
Tommy.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.201
James.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.913
Alright, guys, you have
the rest of the evening

16:37.996 --> 16:40.749
to talk with your human canvas
and come up with a design.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.377
Tomorrow, you'll have five hours
to do this tattoo.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.378
Good luck.

16:46.255 --> 16:46.880
Portraits encompass
everything

16:46.964 --> 16:49.425
we've worked to this point.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.344
{\an8}Great line work, shading,
technical precision,

16:52.428 --> 16:56.432
proportion, being able
to reproduce a photo undeniably.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.267
The main part of face
will be bam right there,

16:58.350 --> 16:59.017
and the name real cool
right there.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.103
Awesome.
That'll definitely work.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.607
The photo I got,
it's very grainy.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.942
{\an8}And it's from 1978.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.861
It has a lot of contrast
in it though.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.820
There's a lot of stuff
I can work with.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.281
I'm totally stressed
for time in this one

17:12.364 --> 17:14.616
because a portrait
is so demanding

17:14.700 --> 17:15.617
and because of the detail
put into it

17:15.701 --> 17:17.703
and the smooth blends.

17:17.786 --> 17:18.537
It can't be that big

17:18.619 --> 17:20.247
'cause we're on
a time restraint,

17:20.329 --> 17:22.540
but... we'll do
as big as possible.

17:22.624 --> 17:25.461
And on top of it, we were handed
that we have to do lettering.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.421
I'll do this in, like, a...
a nice script for you.

17:27.503 --> 17:28.797
That's cool.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.466
I'll use some sort
of design work with the script

17:30.549 --> 17:32.092
to sort of blend into him and...

17:32.176 --> 17:33.510
Your discretion.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.970
It's gonna be hard
to fit it in there.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.682
I'm worried about putting...
putting it anywhere

17:38.766 --> 17:40.976
on the stomach or the ribs.

17:41.059 --> 17:42.644
<i>That means a huge, huge,</i>
<i>huge battle for me.</i>

17:42.728 --> 17:44.980
<i>I [bleep] knew it.</i>

17:45.063 --> 17:47.149
<i>I knew I was gonna get the ribs.</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:49.151
{\an8}Ribs are so hard to tattoo,

17:49.234 --> 17:50.944
{\an8}and when every little movement
you make

17:51.028 --> 17:53.655
changes the facial features
of a portrait.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.116
It's just a bad area
to try to get a portrait.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.327
I have to convince my client

17:58.410 --> 17:59.495
to pick
a different location, man.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.749
This is my last chance.
There's 100 grand on the line.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.169
I'm not letting my client
ruin those chances for me.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.631
What... What other spots
are you willing to get tattooed?

18:10.714 --> 18:13.550
I have nothing
on these areas, so...

18:13.634 --> 18:14.885
So your legs
are all filled up?

18:14.968 --> 18:17.012
No, not on my legs,
but I just... they're so huge.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.681
I don't want
to put anything on my legs.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.351
Anywhere where there's,
like, a flat... a flat surface

18:22.434 --> 18:23.101
that I could really work with.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.395
The outside calf
would be perfect

18:25.479 --> 18:26.605
just 'cause it's so flat.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.486
I mean, if it's, like, a...
really, like, an issue,

18:32.569 --> 18:34.655
we can do it.
we can do it on the leg.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.490
That would be
[bleep] awesome.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.617
We're gonna move
the tattoo to his leg.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.035
This is make it or break it.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.913
I'm either gonna pull it off
or pack my stuff and go home.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.665
We're good.
I appreciate it, man.

18:46.416 --> 18:47.251
About what era
was this taken?

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
{\an5}[Johanna] Sixties, seventies.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
-Yeah.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.588
Johanna wants a portrait
of her mother,

18:51.672 --> 18:54.049
{\an8}and it's so small.

18:54.132 --> 18:57.886
I mean, the actual photograph
of the face of her mother,

18:57.970 --> 18:58.971
you can't see anything.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.306
It's kind of fuzzy,
so I want to...

19:01.390 --> 19:04.017
I want to keep it about...
about this size.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.770
I'm very, very scared
about this one

19:06.854 --> 19:08.522
because I could go home

19:08.605 --> 19:10.107
over having a busted grill.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.609
when I couldn't even figure out
what it's doing.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.610
Wow!

19:13.694 --> 19:16.280
I can't see the hair,
can't see the fuzz.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.824
I can't see... I can't see
nothing in this picture.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.285
[Bleep].

19:28.417 --> 19:29.459
[man] I've been stressed
like crazy lately.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.421
Hell, yeah. it's getting
to that point where every...

19:32.504 --> 19:34.089
every day is way more stressful.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.633
I got one more to get through.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.844
Got to be harder with
[bleep] James and Tommy.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.720
I'm totally nervous.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.930
{\an8}I mean, the 100 grand
on the line,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.098
and I feel like
I've come to the challenge

19:43.182 --> 19:46.101
where the canvas
is just really [bleep] me.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.811
You're clearly gonna
beat James, you know?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.146
Yeah, I can do a portrait.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.190
{\an8}Josh and James...
They're not real portrait dudes.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.901
He has a somewhat
difficult photo to use.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.277
not a lot of detail in it,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.030
but I'm really confident
with that type of stuff.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.115
He's probably gonna have
a difficult time with it.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.783
James don't do any portraits
I don't think.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.451
James is sweating bullets.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.745
Yeah.
Who's he kidding?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.206
Morning, guys.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.667
It's time for you all
to push your skills to the limit

20:10.751 --> 20:14.129
and tattoo a portrait
on your human canvas.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.381
You have five hours
to complete this tattoo,

20:17.174 --> 20:18.091
And your time...

20:18.675 --> 20:19.593
starts now.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.472
{\an8}What we're testing
is your ability

20:23.555 --> 20:25.474
{\an8}to capture the likeness
of the person.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.391
What's gonna make it
recognizable

20:26.475 --> 20:28.810
is having just
the correct dimensions,

20:28.894 --> 20:31.313
so the shading around the eyes
and the nose and the lips...

20:31.396 --> 20:33.148
if that stuff isn't just right,

20:33.231 --> 20:34.232
the face isn't gonna be
the same shape.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.153
How's the leg?

20:38.236 --> 20:39.655
[man] Feels good, man.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.156
I'm just trying to get
through this lettering,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.158
so I can actually talk to you.

20:43.241 --> 20:46.078
It's the most nerve-racking day
in this entire competition.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.162
{\an8}I feel like it could be
make or break for me.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.873
I don't do a whole lot
of black and gray.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.750
It's definitely not my forte,

20:51.833 --> 20:53.543
but I feel like
I've come light years

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
beyond the last black and gray
tattoo I've done.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.467
Twenty minutes of
daydreaming has passed.

21:01.718 --> 21:05.305
I get lost in the head and start
daydreaming about [bleep].

21:05.389 --> 21:06.723
Today's style, like,
super smooth portrait

21:06.807 --> 21:08.809
black and gray tattoos.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.519
{\an8}They're super stressful
for some people,

21:10.602 --> 21:11.269
but it's relaxing to me.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.772
I just love duplicating images.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.692
Aside from my canvas passing out
and not letting me finish it,

21:16.775 --> 21:18.151
I'm clearly gonna
win this challenge.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.530
Shane of course gets
the perfect canvas.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.699
He got the best picture
out of all of us.

21:23.782 --> 21:24.866
He could've done it in color.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.618
Of course Shane
would pick black and gray.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.204
Heaven forbid he have
to whip out some colors.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.748
Alright, just a little bit.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.458
Try not to crease
'cause there's the hairs

21:33.542 --> 21:34.751
right in the crease.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.714
{\an8}I'm really frustrated
about this tattoo.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.757
I stayed up late
and worked on this portrait,

21:40.841 --> 21:43.343
trying to blow it up
and see some of the details,

21:43.427 --> 21:44.261
but you can't see anything.

21:44.344 --> 21:47.055
And I gotta put it
in a difficult spot?

21:47.139 --> 21:47.889
I mean, this is [bleep].

21:47.973 --> 21:49.683
[indistinct chatter]

21:51.184 --> 21:52.561
{\an8}James didn't talk his client

21:52.644 --> 21:54.062
{\an8}into putting it
on a better spot.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.188
{\an8}He should know better.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.024
that just puts a smile
on my face.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.734
I'm hoping James
is going home

21:58.817 --> 21:59.317
and I'll be safe.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.447
[Dave] Alright,
four hours to go.

22:04.114 --> 22:08.618
[tattoo guns buzzing]

22:08.702 --> 22:09.911
Hello, Mr. Jack Rudy.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.079
I'm having a little difficulty

22:11.163 --> 22:12.789
because there's
a lot of contrast,

22:12.873 --> 22:14.082
but the shading is very dark.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.292
{\an8}There's not much
of a gray scale to it.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.170
So I am a little concerned
with what judges ought to say.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.713
Pressure's on me right now.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.589
That's right, no pressure.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.050
Let me just get right in here
real...

22:23.133 --> 22:24.051
Oh, sorry.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.969
The most important part
of a portrait to me

22:26.053 --> 22:28.430
{\an8}is the accuracy of it.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.683
It's really being able
to capture that person...

22:31.767 --> 22:33.351
their expression, the look.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.228
you've really,
really gotta be careful,

22:35.312 --> 22:36.521
'cause one false move,

22:36.605 --> 22:38.940
and it just doesn't
really look like that person.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.736
{\an8}I believe I'm definitely
at a disadvantage.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.654
My picture is super difficult.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.616
It's a contrasting,
whited-out mess.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.992
Still going, still going.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.327
How you feeling?

22:50.410 --> 22:51.369
It's definitely
out of my element.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.330
There's obviously
a lot of different skills,

22:53.413 --> 22:55.749
a lot of different tricks
of the trade

22:55.832 --> 22:57.375
that are involved in getting
a portrait to look just right.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.628
And whoever doesn't have
those tricks,

22:59.711 --> 23:00.420
it's gonna show.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.755
That's two hours
to go, people.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.507
Two more.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.386
{\an8}I think that
there's a very limited number

23:08.470 --> 23:11.181
{\an8}of tattooers that can actually
pull portraits off.

23:11.264 --> 23:14.976
And if you do one eye,
one shape

23:15.060 --> 23:16.019
and the other eye
a different shape...

23:16.103 --> 23:19.189
If you mess the lips up,
the whole face changes.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.482
You can beat a portrait up
with one move.

23:22.275 --> 23:22.442
You're doing awesome, girl.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.488
She's not taking it very well

23:26.571 --> 23:28.949
{\an8}'cause she picked a spot
that was really bad.

23:29.032 --> 23:30.909
I mean, it's on the bottom
of her hip.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.870
All around it's not
a fun issue right now.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.331
I'm pretty scared
because I could go home tonight.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.499
Alright, one more hour.
That's four down.

23:43.839 --> 23:44.881
What's up, Shane?

23:44.965 --> 23:45.423
It's going well.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.008
Skin's pretty much

23:47.092 --> 23:48.218
how I expected it
to be for this spot.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.303
An extra two hours
would be awesome.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.013
Then I could relax,
you know what I mean?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.432
{\an8}Shane's done nothing
but black and gray.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.018
I haven't been able to just sit

23:57.102 --> 24:00.313
and do cartoons and colors
the entire time,

24:00.397 --> 24:02.566
and that's exactly
what Shane has done.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.109
{\an8}If Shane stuck
with the original picture

24:04.192 --> 24:05.193
and made the portrait color,

24:05.277 --> 24:06.695
i think it would've taken on
a whole new life.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.823
Instead he took the easy way out
and did black and gray.

24:09.906 --> 24:10.782
Being Ink Master
takes a lot more

24:10.866 --> 24:12.826
than just following
a comfortable route.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.579
Of course everyone
wants to be number one

24:15.662 --> 24:18.790
and have the best tattoo
and have the best piece here.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.625
It's a competitive thing.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.294
My tattoo is right up there
with Shane's,

24:22.377 --> 24:23.920
and I definitely have
a chance to win this.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.547
Shane can keep doing
black and gray.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.131
I'll just be the Ink Master.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.675
Fifteen minutes left.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.805
I'm tattooing
straight to the end.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.556
It's frustrating.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.766
It's going really, really slow.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.852
Twenty seconds.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.145
[bleep].

24:40.812 --> 24:41.646
Ten seconds.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.649
Time's up. That's it.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.067
Put your machines down.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.110
No more ink.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.529
That is amazing, bro.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.364
I'm winning it.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.158
There's literally, like,
no doubt in my hand

24:53.241 --> 24:55.243
that I'm gonna win this thing.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.578
Looks amazing
from here, bro.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.662
Thanks, man.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.123
I definitely feel good
about myself in this.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.542
{\an8}This is something
that I don't do all the time.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.295
I've done very, very, very few
black and gray portraits.

25:05.378 --> 25:07.589
For me to come out
on top of this

25:07.672 --> 25:09.090
is gonna mean a lot.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.508
See, maybe James busted his up.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.262
He did awesome.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.264
{\an8}I'm not as happy as I should be
with this completed tattoo.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.309
Hope it don't...
send me home.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.855
{\an8}The portrait is not
all that accurate

25:23.939 --> 25:24.856
{\an8}to the photograph.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.066
I don't consider myself
a portrait artist.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.443
The placement in this thing
beat the hell out of you.

25:28.526 --> 25:29.486
In this situation
of high pressure,

25:29.569 --> 25:32.572
you put yourself
in a really tough spot.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.706
Alright, one of us
are going home.

25:41.790 --> 25:44.292
You don't even need
to discuss that [bleep].

25:44.376 --> 25:45.460
{\an8}During this whole
competition,

25:45.543 --> 25:47.504
{\an8}this is the most relaxed
I've been.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.173
If I don't win this challenge,
I'm walking the [bleep] out.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.216
You're gonna sit here

25:51.299 --> 25:53.593
and tell me you don't know
who's going home?

25:53.677 --> 25:54.970
I don't think
that's guaranteed, dude,

25:55.053 --> 25:57.097
because of
past performance, man.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.139
I don't think
anybody's safe really.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.600
Just like we said though,
it's gonna come down

26:00.684 --> 26:02.185
to who gets a [bleep] canvas

26:02.269 --> 26:04.729
or who gets something
that they're not used to doing.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.856
I think that I might have
changed some things

26:06.940 --> 26:09.776
that hurt me, I mean,
just 'cause of the picture.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.694
{\an8}Going into the critique,

26:10.777 --> 26:12.279
{\an8}honestly, I feel like
I'm probably

26:12.362 --> 26:13.488
{\an8}the one that could go home.

26:13.571 --> 26:14.698
I definitely feel like

26:14.781 --> 26:16.783
they're gonna lay into me
pretty good.

26:16.866 --> 26:17.659
Somebody good is going home.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.835
{\an8}[tattoo gun buzzes]

26:26.918 --> 26:31.423
â™ª

26:37.846 --> 26:38.888
Welcome to tonight's
elimination.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.516
This week we've been testing
your portrait skills.

26:41.599 --> 26:43.518
We'll be looking
at your shading, detail,

26:43.601 --> 26:47.022
and how much your tattoo
looks like the picture.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.315
Shane, you're up first.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.945
Out of all the portraits
available,

26:54.029 --> 26:55.196
you chose the child.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.740
I didn't want you to think
I was taking the easy way out.

26:56.823 --> 27:00.076
I felt like this one would shine
the most with her smile

27:00.160 --> 27:01.619
and the glitter in her eyes
and everything.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.621
And the hair was pretty crazy
to take on.

27:03.705 --> 27:06.750
I've done
a lot of child portraits myself,

27:06.833 --> 27:09.210
and ones with teeth
are without a doubt

27:09.294 --> 27:11.921
the most difficult
of children's portraits to do.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.841
It really, uh,
looks like the photograph.

27:14.924 --> 27:15.925
Really nice, accurate job.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.553
In the photo where
it was not a lot of contrast,

27:18.636 --> 27:21.222
not a lot of definition
to show the nose,

27:21.306 --> 27:24.225
you picked out just the right
amount of subtleness and grazed

27:24.309 --> 27:26.853
those little, soft details
that pull it together.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.397
In the photograph,
the light that's in her eyes

27:29.481 --> 27:31.733
is the reflection of the flash.

27:31.816 --> 27:32.817
The flash, yeah.

27:32.901 --> 27:34.569
And so you had to move that
and use your white

27:34.652 --> 27:37.238
in a different spot
to really make it

27:37.322 --> 27:38.031
appear lifelike.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.491
Awesome.
I'm glad you noticed.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.242
Amazing touch.
Yeah, man.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.078
You really pulled
the likeness together.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.246
You definitely have
the "less is more" approach.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.581
You did the name
and the portrait.

27:46.664 --> 27:49.501
Nothing more needed.
Great job, man.

27:49.584 --> 27:50.668
Thank you.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.255
James Vaughn.

27:57.967 --> 27:58.426
How are you feeling
about this piece?

27:58.510 --> 28:00.428
It was a tough one.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.806
The original picture
is actually, like, this big.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.183
The portrait
is not all that accurate

28:05.266 --> 28:06.518
to the photograph.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.852
Part of doing a portrait.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.523
is being able to see accurately
what's in the photo

28:11.606 --> 28:13.650
and translate that
into the tattoo.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.692
I don't consider myself
a portrait artist.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.570
You know, this is what the task
at hand was,

28:17.654 --> 28:19.364
and I just did my best.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.573
Where I think
you kind of lost it

28:20.657 --> 28:22.575
is you actually put some shading
in her nose,

28:22.659 --> 28:25.286
where in the photo,
there wasn't.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.413
It was more of a highlight
on the tip of her nose,

28:26.496 --> 28:28.623
and you kind of shaded it out,

28:28.706 --> 28:30.917
which effectively changes
the shape of her nose.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.338
The eyes look like they might be
just a slight different shape

28:35.422 --> 28:36.631
{\an5}-than they are in the photo.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.631
-Kind of in the picture

28:36.714 --> 28:37.924
a little.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.634
The lettering
that you did too,

28:39.717 --> 28:42.387
there's so much going on
around it all...

28:42.470 --> 28:44.139
all the flowers
and flourishing...

28:44.222 --> 28:45.515
and it makes it
very difficult to read

28:45.598 --> 28:48.059
even if you can read Spanish.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.060
I mean, I've learned
the hard way

28:49.144 --> 28:50.812
over the years
that sometimes less is more.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.567
Your line work is shaky
in this tattoo

28:55.650 --> 28:58.319
because you're in a shaky spot.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.321
The placement in this thing
beat the hell out of you,

29:00.405 --> 29:02.532
And I feel like that's
a little bit of self-inflicted

29:02.615 --> 29:04.868
because you allowed that
to happen to yourself.

29:04.951 --> 29:08.163
The fact of the matter
is where her face is,

29:08.246 --> 29:09.914
where it lands in that tattoo
is where her body

29:09.998 --> 29:13.668
that's very voluptuous
comes together and meets.

29:13.751 --> 29:16.671
So her face is almost on indent
of this girl's body.

29:16.754 --> 29:19.090
The bottom line
is I'm not easing up on anybody.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.008
for the stakes being this high,

29:20.091 --> 29:23.052
you put yourself
in a really tough spot

29:23.136 --> 29:25.013
to excel in this tattoo today.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.809
Wowzers!

29:32.937 --> 29:37.567
[Dave] Tommy.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.860
{\an5}-What are your thoughts?

29:37.567 --> 29:38.860
-I dug it.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.236
You know, I was into the piece.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.071
Little bit of a dark picture
to work with,

29:42.155 --> 29:44.699
like, a little grainy, but I did
what I could with it.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.202
With a photo like this
being grainy and whatnot,

29:47.285 --> 29:48.661
and being from the era
that it was,

29:48.745 --> 29:51.539
this style that you tattooed it
is perfect.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.249
As far as the likeness
to the photo,

29:53.333 --> 29:54.209
it's dead-on, man.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.210
You got the detail in there
just right.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.212
And I love the fact

29:57.295 --> 29:58.087
that you weren't scared
to go with black

29:58.171 --> 30:00.381
and put the heavy shading
in there.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.341
This wasn't an incidence
where you needed

30:01.424 --> 30:02.467
super soft, delicate...

30:02.550 --> 30:05.553
it's an army-time war photo.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.055
It's got a vintage feel to it.

30:07.138 --> 30:07.972
The details in the buckles

30:08.056 --> 30:10.099
and all the highlights
and everything,

30:10.183 --> 30:11.976
that's the best part
of this tat, man.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.520
The lettering I like

30:13.603 --> 30:16.898
except it's too wide,
and it's hard to read

30:16.981 --> 30:19.817
because, like, see,
where the "P" starts on there

30:19.901 --> 30:21.986
and then where the "Y" is,
the "Y" is off.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.696
I mean, you've got to turn
someone's arm

30:23.780 --> 30:25.323
to see the whole name.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.784
I would've made
that more legible,

30:27.867 --> 30:30.828
and even a little smaller,
different style.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.205
I did the lettering
like it was

30:32.288 --> 30:33.706
just to be
a little more masculine.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.416
I like the white highlights
in it,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.085
but it's just
a little bit wide and...

30:37.168 --> 30:38.211
and just kind of hard
to read too

30:38.294 --> 30:41.339
because the shading
goes real close to it.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.591
Technically,
it's a really nice tattoo, man.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.593
And it took... took balls
to make it real dark.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.178
Thank you so much,
gentlemen.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.183
Josh.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.773
You had a difficult photo
to work from, man,

30:58.856 --> 31:00.900
so you definitely
had a handicap on this.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.902
Yeah, man, it was a...
just a whited-out picture.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.030
With the whites of the eyes,
what you've done

31:06.114 --> 31:07.615
is you've done
what's in the picture.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.450
What I would've liked
to have seen

31:09.534 --> 31:12.954
is maybe make the eyes
look round and in the head.

31:13.037 --> 31:13.871
Because they are so blown out
in the photo

31:13.955 --> 31:16.833
that to fill it in
with white like that

31:16.916 --> 31:19.294
really flattened out
her expression.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.379
Unless there's
an actual highlight there,

31:21.462 --> 31:24.507
I would never put white
in the eyeball like that

31:24.591 --> 31:26.301
because it does tend
to flatten it out,

31:26.384 --> 31:28.761
and then plus it turns yellow
with age.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.388
The lettering I liked.

31:30.471 --> 31:32.724
It was more minimal
where less is more sometimes.

31:32.807 --> 31:37.103
I would've loved
to seen some hair detail.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.980
You have the shape
and the construction

31:39.063 --> 31:39.897
of the hair there
with the shading,

31:39.981 --> 31:41.399
but you didn't really
detail it out

31:41.482 --> 31:43.526
with any hairlines.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.153
Just a few touches
here and there

31:45.236 --> 31:48.448
of some thin lines
kind of make it look like hair.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.116
There's a definite trick
to hair that

31:50.199 --> 31:51.492
that guy standing
right back there

31:51.576 --> 31:52.952
can tell you one little trick

31:53.036 --> 31:54.954
that'll change your life,
and it's so easy.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.830
Little touches of detail
like that

31:55.913 --> 31:58.708
are what make portraits
really shine.

31:58.791 --> 31:59.917
You don't have to have
exorbitant detail

32:00.001 --> 32:03.338
in every nook and cranny,
but when you do,

32:03.421 --> 32:05.173
bring certain aspects of it out

32:05.256 --> 32:06.341
with little details
here and there.

32:06.424 --> 32:07.842
The whole photo
just kind of clicks.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.093
I think that's
where you're lacking.

32:16.768 --> 32:17.852
Alright, guys.

32:17.935 --> 32:20.605
In this group of four,
there's a top two,

32:20.688 --> 32:21.064
and there's a bottom two.

32:26.861 --> 32:27.904
Shane...

32:29.280 --> 32:30.990
you had the best tattoo
of the night.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.033
Thank you.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.038
[suspenseful music]

32:37.121 --> 32:38.581
â™ª

32:38.665 --> 32:41.250
Tommy... you also did
some very impressive work.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.547
You guys have earned
a spot in the finale.

32:47.965 --> 32:48.049
Yeah, Tommy.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.012
[suspenseful music]

32:53.096 --> 32:56.849
James and Josh... one of you
will be joining them,

32:56.933 --> 32:58.059
and the other one is going home.

32:58.142 --> 33:01.145
We'll call you back
once we've made a decision.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.238
{\an5}-[man] That was terrible.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.238
-Without a doubt.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.573
I don't understand
what's going on.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.409
And I don't know
whether it's just stress,

33:14.492 --> 33:15.493
being exhausted.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.536
I normally don't have a bad day.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.414
It was so, so, so hard to work
with that area.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.457
I should've been
able to tell her to move it.

33:21.541 --> 33:22.792
But they said
that your line work

33:22.875 --> 33:24.627
was a little crooked,
and it was crowded.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.379
It was maybe jumbled.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.672
I mean, when she stood

33:27.755 --> 33:28.798
in the right direction
where I put...

33:28.881 --> 33:31.718
how I put the stencil on...
everything was great.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.386
I really think
I'm going home tonight.

33:33.469 --> 33:36.055
It's just...
devastating right now.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.474
I ain't making any
[bleep] excuses, whatever.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.608
James, I feel like
they exaggerated

33:47.692 --> 33:49.444
bad remarks on you, dude.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.445
It was bad.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.280
You never know, man.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.407
Once again
I'm on the fire line with James.

33:54.490 --> 33:56.367
{\an8}I'm still confident in my tattoo

33:56.451 --> 33:57.785
{\an8}and not going home tonight.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.786
I think James is gonna
get [bleep].

33:58.870 --> 34:01.664
The critique.
Past performance.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.040
You know, I think you've shined
a couple times.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.626
They're probably gonna
bend you over

34:05.710 --> 34:06.878
when you go up there.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.465
Alright, guys.
let's talk about this.

34:10.547 --> 34:11.299
It's Josh and James.
I mean, this is it.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.467
This is coming down
to the wire.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.012
Last week, James
jacked up the face

34:16.094 --> 34:19.181
and put two right feet
on his pin-up and stayed.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.808
Now he's delivering
the portrait

34:20.891 --> 34:23.436
that looks least like the photo,
and he's gonna stay?

34:23.518 --> 34:25.438
That statement is...
is debatable to me.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.607
Like, compare this photo
to that photo

34:27.690 --> 34:29.984
{\an5}-and this photo to that photo.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.984
-It's an arguable point,

34:30.067 --> 34:31.777
but it's an argument
that you will lose.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.237
I definitely feel like

34:34.322 --> 34:36.199
overall this one
is a better tattoo.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.199
Really?

34:37.283 --> 34:39.409
I think there's features
that he did capture,

34:39.494 --> 34:40.453
and there's features
that he didn't capture.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.996
She's got two different
shape eyes in the photo.

34:42.079 --> 34:45.333
One's coming in to a point,
and one's rounded.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.501
The right side's rounded.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.168
The left side comes down
into an actual point.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.339
The nose is where he lost it
the most for me.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.380
And the shape of the hair...

34:52.465 --> 34:54.592
The overall shape
of the top of the hair.

34:54.675 --> 34:57.970
I would've tried
to really focus on her

34:58.054 --> 34:59.013
and do her bigger.

34:59.096 --> 35:00.807
He could've eliminated
all this other stuff

35:00.890 --> 35:02.350
that was
very time-consuming

35:02.433 --> 35:04.519
and probably done
a much better job.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.020
He handicapped himself
unnecessarily.

35:06.103 --> 35:09.524
What sucks a little bit
about this is that

35:09.607 --> 35:11.359
he knows some of the tricks.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.652
He knows some of the ways

35:12.735 --> 35:14.403
to get the effects
that are necessary

35:14.487 --> 35:15.238
in different texture areas,

35:15.321 --> 35:17.532
and he just didn't
pull them off.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.825
And I will say this,
Josh had the foresight

35:18.908 --> 35:21.702
to get this guy off the ribcage.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.538
Her face is more accurate.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.498
It looks like the guy's mom.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.624
[Oliver] Not the eyes though.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.377
[Chris] The right retina
is bigger than the left.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.294
[Oliver] That's what I'm saying.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.254
They're different shapes,

35:31.337 --> 35:32.630
but they're not
the same two shapes.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.883
Her upper lip isn't the same
on both sides in the photo.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.301
[Dave] The mouth is wider too.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.596
I think the nose and mouth
on this one look like the photo.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.558
The rest of it, I...
I feel like it's a wash.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.977
The eyes and the hair
kill it so bad for me.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.270
Yeah, looks like
she's wearing

35:47.353 --> 35:49.063
the veil instead of hair.

35:49.146 --> 35:50.565
I can't vote
for this one, man.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.900
Now when it comes to color,

35:52.984 --> 35:55.236
Josh bangs color,
and I'm in his corner.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.071
But this is a nightmare to me.

35:57.154 --> 35:58.906
I'll say in James' defense

35:58.990 --> 36:01.826
there's way more
three dimensions happening.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.245
He knows tricks,
and what bothers me about him

36:04.328 --> 36:05.496
is that he couldn't beat the kid

36:05.580 --> 36:07.874
that doesn't know the tricks
outright convincingly.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.000
{\an5}-Yeah.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.000
-That pisses me off.

36:09.083 --> 36:12.420
The tough call is that
they're both super talented.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.629
What do we do?

36:13.713 --> 36:16.257
I think it's a tough call, man,
because it's not like

36:16.340 --> 36:18.092
one is substantially better
than the other one.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.595
This is a tough one.
You want to go get them?

36:20.678 --> 36:21.679
Ready when you are.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.140
You guys all good?
I think we might have a winner.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.524
Alright, guys,
well, the time is now.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.112
James and Josh...
see you in the shop.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.782
Good Lord, have mercy.

36:41.866 --> 36:42.867
It's been a pleasure.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.368
Good luck
to both of you guys.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.628
[suspenseful music]

36:53.711 --> 36:54.962
â™ª â™ª

36:55.046 --> 36:56.088
This is a tough one, man,

36:56.172 --> 36:57.465
'cause we're down
to the wire here.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.884
Final four.
Both of you guys are talented.

36:59.967 --> 37:00.801
But there can only be
one winner here.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.095
James, tell us why you feel

37:03.179 --> 37:05.222
that you should stay
in this competition.

37:05.306 --> 37:08.684
I've done everything
to the best of my ability.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.562
I've tried things that are
supposedly out of my element

37:11.646 --> 37:14.190
but tried to do everything
and tried to excel.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.816
The more critiques
I get from you,

37:15.900 --> 37:18.569
the better it makes me
because I learn from that.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.864
I should stay in the competition
because I'm well-rounded.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.491
And if I make it
to the next round,

37:23.574 --> 37:24.408
you'll see
what I really do best.

37:25.910 --> 37:26.827
Josh, why do you feel

37:26.911 --> 37:28.871
you deserve to stay
in the competition?

37:28.955 --> 37:31.707
This whole competition
I've been stuck under the gun

37:31.791 --> 37:33.334
with lots of things that
I'm not well-rounded at doing.

37:33.417 --> 37:37.588
I feel like the competitor in me
just made me focus.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.257
Being critiqued made me better.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.133
I feel like I have
strong points.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.426
I still have weak points.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.679
But I just feel like
I've definitely showed

37:44.762 --> 37:47.348
that I could become a <i> Ink Master</i>
and a well-rounded tattooer

37:47.431 --> 37:49.934
that you guys were looking for
from the beginning.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.186
You guys made it
to this point for a reason.

37:52.269 --> 37:53.521
The fact that y'all
are still here

37:53.604 --> 37:55.064
and the fact that
you made it this far

37:55.147 --> 37:56.816
I think is definitely
due to your strong,

37:56.899 --> 37:57.984
real tattoo upbringing.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.569
And I feel like y'all
got a long career ahead of you.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.029
Never stop getting better.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.072
Never stop trying to progress
with your work.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.865
Second, you stop trying
to get better,

38:04.949 --> 38:07.785
might as well quit.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.704
James, I'm gonna start with
the portrait you did tonight.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.372
Black and gray
is not my strong suit,

38:11.455 --> 38:13.874
but I try, and this is what
was ahead of me,

38:13.958 --> 38:15.376
so I had to do
the best I could.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.502
I still think
there are some issues, man.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.295
A little bit of stuff
that you kind of embellish

38:18.379 --> 38:21.382
a little bit on that altered
her nose a little bit.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.592
All in all, you didn't do
a perfect portrait.

38:24.802 --> 38:25.428
Your placement
of this tattoo

38:25.511 --> 38:28.055
was definitely your bad, man.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.932
I'm not happy
with what you did there.

38:30.016 --> 38:30.933
This is you, brother.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.309
This is your chance
to make it or break it.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.937
You should've put
your foot down on this.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.897
[Dave] Josh.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.317
There are some things
that I had problems with.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.528
Eyebrows are substantially
thinner on this one

38:42.611 --> 38:44.030
than the actual photo.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.948
The eyes themselves
are a little off.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.783
And the lips are close.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.910
The hair is another story.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.370
I really wish
you could've got

38:51.454 --> 38:52.747
a more hairlike texture.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.540
When you first look
at this tattoo,

38:54.623 --> 38:56.250
it kind of just throws you off.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.169
The feel of the tattoo,
you know,

38:58.252 --> 39:00.087
it doesn't just come off soft
right as soon as you look at it.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.339
It takes us a minute to stop,

39:02.423 --> 39:03.424
focus in
on the different details.

39:03.507 --> 39:07.386
It doesn't have
that real natural look to it.

39:07.470 --> 39:08.721
It's just a little bit off.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.097
This is one
of those things where,

39:10.181 --> 39:13.559
in a very short amount of time,
you came a long way.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.435
You grabbed the bull
by the horns,

39:14.518 --> 39:16.771
and you gave it
a really strong shot.

39:16.854 --> 39:17.605
Couple of tricks away, man.

39:17.688 --> 39:18.481
It's gonna make
all the difference.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.693
Between the two of you,

39:22.777 --> 39:25.362
we went back and forth
and debated.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.281
This is what's making this
so hard, man.

39:27.364 --> 39:30.534
You guys both really hit
in a lot of areas,

39:30.618 --> 39:32.620
and you also missed
in some areas.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.038
There's so much
on the line here.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.707
There's the 100 grand,
the <i> Ink</i> magazine feature.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.541
but there can only be
one winner here.

39:56.018 --> 39:57.561
You're going to the finale.
Congratulations, man.

40:01.732 --> 40:02.608
Josh...

40:05.069 --> 40:06.821
You don't have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:08.405 --> 40:11.325
Time to pack your machines...
and go home.

40:12.576 --> 40:13.494
I'm sorry.

40:18.541 --> 40:19.500
Mr. Vaughn.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.127
Yes, sir.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.461
You've made it
to the finale.

40:23.295 --> 40:24.213
Whew.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.425
Don't relax, bro.
This is not the time to relax.

40:28.509 --> 40:30.511
You know it's only
gonna get tougher.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.429
You up for this?

40:32.513 --> 40:34.306
{\an5}-All the time.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.306
-Alright, bro.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.558
Head back to the Brownstone.

40:35.641 --> 40:35.683
Thank you, guys.

40:40.437 --> 40:41.272
I'm pissed off.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.690
I feel like I got screwed.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.358
I did the better tattoo.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.152
Boggles my mind,
and I know damn well

40:46.235 --> 40:47.570
James knows he doesn't belong.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.577
I'm proud to have been here,
but I got screwed in the end.

three of us now.
