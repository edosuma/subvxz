Hey, Gabby.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.751
Darby Spencer,
reporting for duty

00:51.851 --> 00:53.286
with 10 seconds to spare.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.388
My jerk alarm
decided to not go off.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.058
What is it
with you and technology?

00:58.158 --> 01:00.326
What's the story?
Same guy, different robbery?

01:00.427 --> 01:01.761
Yeah,
third one this week.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.630
Only this time,
the owner fought back.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.232
By the way,
Detective O'Neal is here.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.068
Great.
My day just got even worse.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.673
Ugh, my mom.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.275
You gonna get it?
Nope.

01:15.375 --> 01:16.910
Guaranteed she'd find
a way to insult me

01:17.010 --> 01:18.278
in the first 10 seconds.

01:18.378 --> 01:21.915
At least,
that's her current record.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.050
O'NEAL: Spencer, you're late!

01:24.150 --> 01:25.118
Alright, listen up.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.820
This is the guy
that we're looking for,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.055
last seen fleeing the shop.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.057
He's six feet tall, Caucasian.

01:31.157 --> 01:33.426
He's wearing jeans
and a grey hoodie.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.829
Last sighting, he was
heading towards the alley.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.264
We got a roadblock set up
on the other side.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.600
Doesn't it seem weird
that he would go down the alley?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.268
It's kind of a dead end.

01:42.368 --> 01:45.872
Don't do it...

01:45.972 --> 01:47.740
Detective O'Neal?

01:47.841 --> 01:50.610
I was just thinking, sir,
this guy knows the area, right?

01:50.710 --> 01:52.412
So instead of the alley,
where he's boxed in,

01:52.512 --> 01:53.546
he might've
gone up to the parkade.

01:53.646 --> 01:54.614
O'NEAL: Spencer--

01:54.714 --> 01:56.216
It's a great place
to hide if he's injured,

01:56.316 --> 01:57.750
and from there he could access
the residential building

01:57.851 --> 01:58.751
to get away.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.420
Spencer!
You're not a detective, okay?

02:00.520 --> 02:05.091
So quit the theorizing
and just do your job.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.727
Roger that.

02:31.417 --> 02:35.188
Detective O'Neal,
come in.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.357
O'Neal.

02:40.894 --> 02:44.831
Okay, where are you?

02:46.232 --> 02:48.134
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

02:48.234 --> 02:50.637
Hey, stop!

02:50.737 --> 02:52.238
Augh!

02:52.338 --> 02:55.175
Stay down.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.143
Don't move.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.845
You're under arrest.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.585
Nice job.
Woo!

03:05.685 --> 03:07.654
Thanks.
Yes.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.889
Don't look now;
Sarge is here.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.324
Spencer!

03:11.424 --> 03:14.594
Over here!

03:14.694 --> 03:16.229
O'NEAL: Ugh, here she comes...

03:16.329 --> 03:18.331
Veronica Mars.
Hmph!

03:18.431 --> 03:20.233
Spencer,
Detective O'Neal tells me

03:20.333 --> 03:22.502
you disobeyed a direct order. Oh...

03:22.602 --> 03:23.937
Yeah, but I just
thought that I--

03:24.037 --> 03:25.572
O'NEAL: You just thought
that you knew better.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.907
Like every other time.
But I caught the guy.

03:28.007 --> 03:29.209
Yeah, well,
that doesn't matter!

03:29.309 --> 03:31.010
You see, this is
what I'm talking about.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.679
Last month she followed
a suspect home

03:32.779 --> 03:33.880
without my authorization.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.014
He was accused of arson

03:35.114 --> 03:36.616
and I caught him
setting another fire!

03:36.716 --> 03:38.418
O'NEAL: Time before that,
she released a woman

03:38.518 --> 03:39.452
being held in custody.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.187
Because she went into labour!

03:41.287 --> 03:43.289
What, you don't like it
when a woman makes decisions?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.558
Okay, did you hear that?
It's insubordination.

03:45.658 --> 03:46.626
Alright,
Spencer.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.261
That's enough.
You know the rules.

03:48.361 --> 03:49.395
I'm issuing you a reprimand.

03:49.495 --> 03:50.597
What?!

03:50.697 --> 03:52.865
No, no, no.
Sir, you-- you can't.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.068
I'm set to take
the detective exam next month.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.536
A reprimand will
kill my chances!

03:56.636 --> 03:57.770
Well, you should have
thought of that before

03:57.870 --> 04:00.406
you decided to freestyle
all over my crime scene.

04:00.506 --> 04:01.874
Now get back to work.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.278
O'NEAL:
Detective exam!

04:05.378 --> 04:07.513
No!

04:09.449 --> 04:11.818
O'NEAL: What did you say?
No!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.653
If I had listened
to you this morning,

04:13.753 --> 04:15.955
we'd still be in the alley
searching through tin cans

04:16.055 --> 04:17.223
and pizza boxes.

04:17.323 --> 04:19.125
You couldn't solve a crime
if you committed it yourself!

04:19.225 --> 04:21.160
And if you'd stop
taking leadership hacks

04:21.261 --> 04:23.429
from the Don Draper
School of Management,

04:23.529 --> 04:25.231
you would recognize
that I'm a better detective

04:25.331 --> 04:26.699
than he'll ever be!

04:26.799 --> 04:27.767
I quit.

04:27.867 --> 04:29.902
What?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.538
I quit!

04:33.673 --> 04:36.109
Ugh.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.045
Chase...

04:39.145 --> 04:42.448
Chase?

04:42.548 --> 04:44.117
Hey, honey!

04:44.217 --> 04:46.953
I was...
just about to shower.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.087
You're home early.
What's wrong?

04:48.187 --> 04:50.523
That place is
an incompetent boys club.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.658
I quit.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.126
Oh my God.
You know what?

04:53.226 --> 04:54.494
That's it, I'm taking you out.

04:54.594 --> 04:55.762
Oh, no, I'm really not---

04:55.862 --> 04:58.097
Oh no, no, you just
stay right there, okay?

04:58.197 --> 04:59.132
I'll be right back.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.867
Well, at least
let me change my shirt.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.137
You look great!
You look great.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.539
Huh?

05:06.639 --> 05:09.108
Isn't the market closing soon?

05:09.208 --> 05:10.777
Why are you taking a shower now?

05:10.877 --> 05:13.112
Slow day.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.081
Why is your belt on the floor?

05:15.181 --> 05:16.449
Um...

05:16.549 --> 05:18.484
Hey, oh, Darby, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

05:18.584 --> 05:19.986
Darby, what's wrong with you?

05:20.086 --> 05:22.422
You're acting crazy right now.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.026
Please don't hit me.
I have veneers.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.127
Oh my God!

05:28.227 --> 05:30.563
Okay, Darby, look,
I'm sorry, alright?

05:30.663 --> 05:31.931
It just...
it just happened.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.033
I didn't mean you hurt you.
But what do you expect?

05:34.133 --> 05:36.202
You're never home,
you're always working.

05:36.302 --> 05:37.970
We haven't spent quality time
together in months.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.006
Are you trying
to blame me for this?

05:40.106 --> 05:41.374
You don't even like my TikToks.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.142
Get... out!

05:43.242 --> 05:45.945
Um... this is my condo.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.117
It doesn't get
any better in bed.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.985
That windmill thing
that he does,

05:53.086 --> 05:55.455
that's his only move.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.291
Darby!

06:01.961 --> 06:03.763
Hey Gabby, it's Darby.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.033
Yeah, I know, it has been
a long time, but I was thinking,

06:07.133 --> 06:09.535
you know what would be
such a fun way to catch up?

06:09.635 --> 06:12.438
Listen, could I maybe crash
on your couch for a bit?

06:12.538 --> 06:14.173
Atlanta!

06:14.273 --> 06:16.342
Wow, that's far.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.544
Your in-laws?
No, that's fine.

06:18.644 --> 06:19.579
That's okay...

06:23.416 --> 06:24.684
Hey, Zane!

06:24.784 --> 06:26.386
Darby?
Where are you?

06:26.486 --> 06:27.854
I'm in the city,
but I was thinking

06:27.954 --> 06:30.223
of driving out there.
Can I stay with you guys?

06:31.357 --> 06:33.292
Yeah, you know we'd love
to have you here, Darbs,

06:33.393 --> 06:35.128
but with the baby
and everything...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.296
No, I get it.
That's fine.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.298
She can sleep on the couch!

06:39.399 --> 06:40.833
But...
I think you...

06:40.933 --> 06:44.270
I think you know
who you should call.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.271
Do I have to?

06:46.706 --> 06:48.207
Yeah.

I'm glad you're here.

08:47.994 --> 08:49.495
I've been trying to
reach you for days.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.630
My phone's vintage.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.498
Why don't you get a new one?

08:52.598 --> 08:53.499
I don't know,

08:53.599 --> 08:55.735
the free phone store was closed.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.637
Don't they pay you
at the police station?

08:57.737 --> 08:59.572
Or does Chad
still not have a job?

08:59.672 --> 09:01.774
Trading crypto is a job.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.843
And it's Chase, Mom.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.578
Yes, of course, "Chase."

09:05.678 --> 09:07.613
But how would I know,
since you never visit?

09:07.713 --> 09:09.682
I can't do this.
I've had a really long day.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.551
I have to go to sleep.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.220
Alright, fine.
You know where everything is.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.856
The event starts at 11.
I have to be there early.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.058
You can either come with me
or drive yourself.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.027
The... event?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.828
My book reading.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.764
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

09:24.864 --> 09:26.599
I left you like 98 messages.

09:26.699 --> 09:29.101
Yeah, no,
that is why I'm here.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.269
The book reading.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.737
You didn't know about it,
did you?

09:31.837 --> 09:32.772
Yes, I knew.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.107
I-I... knew.
It's...

09:35.207 --> 09:36.976
I'm tired, Mom.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.945
You know, you don't
take care of yourself.

09:39.045 --> 09:40.379
Let me draw you a bath.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.581
Do not draw me anything.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.950
I'm going to sleep.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.284
Alright, wake you at 7?

09:45.384 --> 09:48.654
Not unless you wanna get tazed!

11:04.930 --> 11:08.401
Holy Mother of--
Mom!

11:08.501 --> 11:09.869
Whoa...

11:09.969 --> 11:12.071
Yikes.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.629
Ugh!

11:36.729 --> 11:38.998
So has the publisher
seen the reviews yet?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.433
You leave that to me.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.902
Focus on your big day, okay?

11:43.002 --> 11:44.603
Okay.
Okay.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.272
Oh, there you are!

11:46.372 --> 11:48.507
I was beginning to think
that we had a gas leak.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.043
Don't give me any ideas!

11:51.143 --> 11:54.080
It's a little early for booze,
don't you think, Mom?

11:54.180 --> 11:55.514
Even for you.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.450
It's not booze if
it's paired with orange juice.

11:57.550 --> 12:01.220
Uh-huh!

12:01.320 --> 12:04.390
Hmm, honey, you remember
my agent, Sarita.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.558
Sarita, Darby.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.960
Of course, hi.
Of course, Darby.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.128
It's been so long!

12:09.228 --> 12:10.863
You two look like sisters.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.264
Sisters?
Mm-hm!

12:12.364 --> 12:14.166
Only a little.
And in bad lighting.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.503
Your mom's
new Bryn Martell thriller

12:17.603 --> 12:19.238
is being released this week!

12:19.338 --> 12:21.006
Have you read it?

12:21.107 --> 12:22.241
Uh...

12:22.341 --> 12:23.576
You know what?

12:23.676 --> 12:26.212
Darby is too busy catching
real criminals to read my books.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.913
Oh, come on!

12:28.013 --> 12:30.683
Your mom is one of the top
mystery writers on the planet.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.151
How could I forget?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.487
I gotta go, but I'll
see you at the reading.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.088
You're gonna change
into something less...

12:36.188 --> 12:38.224
military... right?
Yeah!

12:38.324 --> 12:40.226
Why don't you pick me out
something so we can both

12:40.326 --> 12:42.094
look like Swedish
airline hostesses?

12:42.194 --> 12:44.263
Ow.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.265
Bye, Sarita. Bye.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.100
Children...

12:52.071 --> 12:54.306
Okay, wow,
that's a lot to unpack.

12:54.406 --> 12:55.741
So you quit your job--

12:55.841 --> 12:56.942
You made
the right decision.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.244
Dumped
that dead weight Chase.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.612
Hey, harsh.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.480
But... not wrong.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.215
And now you're moving
back in with your Mom?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.317
Slow down.
I am not moving in with her.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.453
I just crashed there because
you two, for some reason,

13:07.553 --> 13:11.423
you decided to prioritize
this little angel over me.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.591
Alright, walk me through this.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.093
What's wrong with Victoria?

13:14.193 --> 13:15.861
I thought you were the nice one.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.429
What am I gonna do?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.999
All my life, I only
wanted to be a cop.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.701
I just wanted to do
what my dad did, and...

13:22.802 --> 13:26.472
it's not what
I thought it would be.

13:26.572 --> 13:27.773
I want to help people.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.275
I don't want to follow orders.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.110
Does any of this make sense?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.012
You're a lone wolf.

13:33.112 --> 13:36.315
Do not tell her that;
it'll go to her head.

13:36.415 --> 13:39.485
Shoot, I gotta run.

13:39.585 --> 13:41.020
Goodbye!

13:41.120 --> 13:42.788
Goodbye!

13:54.366 --> 13:56.235
International
best-selling author

13:56.335 --> 13:59.572
with over 25 million
copies sold,

13:59.672 --> 14:01.974
five-time winner
of the prestigious

14:02.074 --> 14:04.076
Agatha Award for Best Novel...

14:05.311 --> 14:07.880
Stop, stop!
Maybe this'll be the sixth?

14:07.980 --> 14:09.815
Oh!

14:09.915 --> 14:12.251
Alder Bluffs's own,
Victoria Spencer.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.287
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

14:15.387 --> 14:16.722
Thank you, Sarita.

14:16.822 --> 14:21.327
Thank you all for being here,
and especially my daughter,

14:21.427 --> 14:22.795
Darby Spencer,

14:22.895 --> 14:25.831
who drove all the way
from the city to join us today!

14:28.500 --> 14:29.935
And
without further ado,

14:30.035 --> 14:33.172
I am honoured to share
with you a sneak peek

14:33.272 --> 14:37.509
of my latest
Bryn Martell thriller,

14:37.610 --> 14:39.945
"The Cardinal's Confession."

14:40.045 --> 14:42.514
And what a perfect venue for it.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.251
"Chapter Three.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.921
"Bryn glanced up at the mottled
light cascading down

14:49.021 --> 14:51.257
"from the cathedral's
rose window..."

14:51.357 --> 14:54.460
Darby?
Hey, Darby!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.395
Kaia!

14:56.495 --> 14:57.696
Hey!

14:57.796 --> 14:59.932
I didn't know you were coming!

15:00.032 --> 15:02.034
Oh, yeah, well,
I tried my best to avoid it,

15:02.134 --> 15:05.004
but you know mom.
How are you doing?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.739
You must be finishing
your master's, right?

15:06.839 --> 15:07.873
Journalism?
Yes, yeah.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.575
Next stop, HuffPost!

15:09.675 --> 15:11.010
Well, I mean, I hope.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.878
I've got an interview, so...

15:12.978 --> 15:14.079
Nice.

15:14.179 --> 15:15.781
God, it feels like yesterday
I was babysitting you

15:15.881 --> 15:17.416
and we were crank-calling
the country club.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.651
Do you remember?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.619
I mean, you taught me
all my best swears.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.154
Can't forget.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.290
Um...

15:24.390 --> 15:26.792
Oh, um...
Uh, we'll talk after.

15:26.892 --> 15:27.927
Yeah, sure.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.062
Uh, hi, Dr. Cagney.

15:30.162 --> 15:31.363
"And at that moment,

15:31.463 --> 15:33.265
"Bryn knew she had
but one chance.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.268
"As the assailant
swung his knife..."

15:36.368 --> 15:37.670
Wait, what?

15:37.770 --> 15:39.271
"She ducked
behind the chancel screen

15:39.371 --> 15:40.706
"and grabbed a heavy gold
candlestick--"

15:40.806 --> 15:42.942
No, please!

15:46.712 --> 15:49.648
Kaia?

15:49.748 --> 15:51.450
Uh, I'm sorry.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.953
I'm sorry.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.922
Uh, then...

15:57.022 --> 16:00.492
"Then she felt
a trickle of blood..."

16:00.592 --> 16:03.162
What's going on?
I, um...

16:03.262 --> 16:05.431
The university just called.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.099
I'm being expelled!

16:07.199 --> 16:09.168
They said
I plagiarized my thesis!

16:09.268 --> 16:11.203
What?
That's ridiculous!

16:11.303 --> 16:13.105
You're, like, one of the most
honest people I know.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.673
No, that has to be a mistake.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.875
No, that's what I said!
But they wouldn't listen.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.978
They just kept saying
that my paper was flagged

16:19.078 --> 16:22.281
and that there's
a zero tolerance policy.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.183
I don't know.
Like, this is my future.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.285
This is everything
that I've worked for.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.820
I could look
into this for you.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.655
No, I can't ask you to do that.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.290
No, seriously, I can.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.292
I... have some time now.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.361
I'll go see
the Dean of Admissions.

16:35.461 --> 16:36.695
Really?
Mm-hm.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.697
You'll help me?
Of course we will.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.466
I know the Dean of Admissions personally

16:40.566 --> 16:42.034
and we will visit her
this afternoon.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.970
I'm sorry, "we"?
Oh thank you, you two!

16:45.070 --> 16:47.206
Thank you so much!
Thank you so much!

16:47.306 --> 16:48.540
You two are the best.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.509
It's okay.
It's okay.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.446
What was that about?
What?

16:54.546 --> 16:56.982
I offered to help Kaia. Me.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.117
Well, Officer Spencer,

16:58.217 --> 17:00.319
don't you have to
go back to your job?

17:00.419 --> 17:02.388
Besides,
I am good at this stuff.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.456
Do you know how many
crime stories

17:04.556 --> 17:05.824
I have written in my lifetime?

17:05.924 --> 17:07.726
Not the same thing.

17:07.826 --> 17:11.130
Okay, fine, you go visit
your close acquaintance,

17:11.230 --> 17:14.400
the Dean of Admissions,
all by your lonesome.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.769
Fine.
We'll go to the Dean together.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.772
But after that,
I'm working alone.

17:24.309 --> 17:27.246
Thank you so much
for seeing us, Dr. Cagney.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.348
What a beautiful painting!

17:29.448 --> 17:32.684
It's my newest.
An original Norval Morrisseau.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.220
You've always had
such good taste.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.656
Please, have a seat.

17:37.756 --> 17:38.891
Thank you.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.859
So,
what can I do for you?

17:40.959 --> 17:42.494
I, uh... We...

17:42.594 --> 17:47.399
ran into Kaia Zhang today,
and she's a close family friend.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.535
Oh, yes.
What a shame.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.070
I had such high hopes for her.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.839
She said her thesis
was flagged for plagiarism.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.074
What does that mean?

17:55.174 --> 17:56.708
The university
uses a state-of-the-art

17:56.809 --> 17:57.843
submissions portal.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.344
Students upload their papers,

17:59.445 --> 18:01.346
where they're checked
against known cheat sites.

18:01.447 --> 18:02.581
Could we see proof?

18:02.681 --> 18:05.150
I'm sorry,
that's confidential.

18:05.250 --> 18:09.054
Wanda, it would go a long way
to appeasing my concerns.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.824
You know, as a donor.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.725
Ah...

18:13.826 --> 18:16.728
Okay.
Keep this between us?

18:16.829 --> 18:19.331
Of course!

18:23.335 --> 18:26.738
As you can see,
Kaia's thesis was tracked

18:26.839 --> 18:29.708
to a website called Termpaperfox.com.

18:29.808 --> 18:33.779
It appears she purchased an
existing paper and modified it.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.248
I'm so sorry.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.053
Termpaperfox?
I've never heard of that.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.488
According to
the Dean of Admissions,

18:42.588 --> 18:44.389
your thesis is
on their site, here.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.591
Thank you.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.594
I don't understand.
I would never do any...

18:50.662 --> 18:52.297
This isn't my thesis!

18:52.397 --> 18:55.934
Or, it is my thesis,
but it's not the final version.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.904
Okay, I was writing
about depression and anxiety

18:59.004 --> 19:00.272
and how it impacts athletics,

19:00.372 --> 19:02.174
specifically
the men's basketball team.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.575
But I deleted this part about

19:03.675 --> 19:05.511
pre-existing
mental health conditions.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.280
So, someone uploaded an
earlier version of your work?

19:08.380 --> 19:10.916
But why?

19:11.016 --> 19:12.618
So it would be flagged

19:12.718 --> 19:14.453
by the system
when you turned it in.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.622
So this was planned?

19:16.722 --> 19:20.893
But how did they steal
your paper, Kaia?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.961
Oh my God!
When I lost my computer!

19:23.061 --> 19:25.130
Somebody took it
at the library a few weeks ago.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.732
I thought it was
just an accident

19:26.832 --> 19:28.267
because it showed up
the next day,

19:28.367 --> 19:30.802
exactly where I was sitting.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.039
Do you have any idea
who would do this?

19:34.139 --> 19:35.073
Yeah.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.708
Jerome Callaghan.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.511
He's a starting point guard
on the men's team.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.813
I heard he was using
performance-enhancing drugs

19:41.914 --> 19:43.582
and I wanted to cover
that in my thesis.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.285
But he completely blew up
when I tried to talk to him.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.987
Well, I think it's time
we paid this Jerome Callaghan

19:49.087 --> 19:51.423
a social call.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.364
This is it, the
Faculty of Physical Education.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.732
The gym's inside.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.668
Whoa,
where are you going?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.736
We agreed that after the Dean,
I would work solo.

20:04.836 --> 20:05.737
You're staying here.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.339
What?

20:23.088 --> 20:25.023
Let's go, let's go.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.325
Ramos, come on!

20:26.425 --> 20:27.759
Come on,
pick it up, Ramos!

20:27.859 --> 20:28.860
Come on!

20:28.961 --> 20:31.964
You too, Callaghan!

20:49.848 --> 20:50.882
Jerome Callaghan?

20:50.983 --> 20:51.850
Yeah?

20:51.950 --> 20:53.352
Can I ask you
a few questions?

20:53.452 --> 20:54.386
Who are you?

20:54.486 --> 20:55.721
A friend of Kaia Zhang.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.757
How come you didn't want to
talk to her about her thesis?

21:10.369 --> 21:11.570
How'd you
know about that?

21:11.670 --> 21:12.871
Well, she--

21:12.971 --> 21:14.673
Hey, Callaghan!
What's the problem here?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.341
This is a private
practice, Miss.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.442
No, I know.

21:17.542 --> 21:18.777
I'm just asking him
a few questions.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.479
The door is right there.
You can use it.

21:20.579 --> 21:24.116
Thank you.

21:24.216 --> 21:25.417
Come on, get back in there!

21:25.517 --> 21:27.152
Yes, coach.
Come on!

21:27.252 --> 21:29.955
Here we go, guys!
Move it, move it!

21:31.890 --> 21:33.025
There you are. Hey.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.960
Finally.
Look what I found.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.094
What are those?

21:36.194 --> 21:37.996
Performance-enhancing drugs,
I presume.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.731
I found them in
Jerome's gym bag.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.333
So you just took them?

21:41.433 --> 21:42.834
What, you're committing
crimes now?

21:42.934 --> 21:44.236
It's just a few pills.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.937
Besides, you should be grateful.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.473
Looks like you came up
empty-handed.

21:48.573 --> 21:52.110
And as Bryn Martell always says,
"Always have a backup plan!"

21:52.210 --> 21:54.813
Bryn Martell.

21:55.981 --> 21:56.348
Sugar pie, honey

21:56.348 --> 21:56.481

22:16.668 --> 22:18.236
Good morning.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.604
Oh.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.073
I'm sorry, did I wake you?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.375
No, I was already up.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.510
You seem
uncharacteristically chipper.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.379
Yeah, I guess I am.

22:27.479 --> 22:28.680
Do you want some coffee?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.382
No, I'll get some
on the road.

22:30.482 --> 22:33.919
Okay.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.254
I'm glad you're here,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.623
because we have to get
those pills analyzed right away.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.625
Do you think that the lab
at your police station

22:40.726 --> 22:41.626
would do it for us?

22:41.727 --> 22:42.594
Oh... no.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.896
I think they're
probably really busy.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.065
But I was thinking
I might go by the hospital.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.433
Why would we go--

22:48.533 --> 22:49.901
Oh!
Lucas!

22:50.001 --> 22:50.969
Relax.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.070
There's nothing between us.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.538
We dated in high school.

22:53.638 --> 22:56.208
Uh-huh, well, it's never too
late to make a good impression.

22:56.308 --> 22:58.443
That's...
not the saying.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.178
You can't go
dressed like that.

23:00.278 --> 23:01.480
You need to borrow a blouse.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.048
Everyone says we look
like sisters, so...

23:03.148 --> 23:06.318
Your agent, who you pay
money to, said that one time!

23:06.418 --> 23:08.553
Whatever.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.089
I've got this.
You can...

23:11.189 --> 23:13.492
I don't know, go back to
your sugarpie-honeybunching.

23:13.592 --> 23:14.726
Fine.

23:14.826 --> 23:16.728
But as God is my witness,
you will wear lipstick!

23:16.828 --> 23:18.430
Never gonna happen!

23:26.238 --> 23:29.341
Ugh!

23:33.779 --> 23:35.981
Whoa, you okay there?
Everybody okay?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.916
...Darby?

23:38.016 --> 23:39.418
Lucas!

23:39.518 --> 23:40.786
What are you doing here?

23:40.886 --> 23:42.754
You work here... right.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.289
I, uh...
I was just...

23:44.389 --> 23:47.325
walking and looking at my phone,
and you know how that goes.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.927
So... good as new.

23:49.027 --> 23:51.163
Yeah!
It just needs to be sanitized.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.531
Right.

23:52.631 --> 23:53.532
Sorry.

23:53.632 --> 23:54.766
When did you
get back into town?

23:54.866 --> 23:55.967
I didn't know you were here.

23:56.067 --> 23:57.569
I drove up for
my mom's book reading,

23:57.669 --> 23:59.171
but then I stayed because...

23:59.271 --> 24:00.305
it's complicated.

24:00.405 --> 24:01.706
Why does that not surprise me?

24:01.807 --> 24:03.809
Hey, you used to
find that charming!

24:03.909 --> 24:06.945
Eh, sometimes.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.481
While I have you,
maybe you could do me a favour?

24:09.581 --> 24:14.052
Could you tell me if these are
performance-enhancing drugs?

24:14.152 --> 24:15.387
Is this for a case?

24:15.487 --> 24:17.789
I guess you could say that.

24:17.889 --> 24:20.625
Yeah, they're
performance-enhancing...

24:20.725 --> 24:22.360
in a sense.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.528
They're ED meds.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.696
As in...?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.031
Erectile dysfunction.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.667
Oh!
Okay.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.036
Was not expecting that.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.637
Sorry to disappoint you.

24:32.737 --> 24:35.073
Luckily you never did.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.342
Inside voice...

24:37.442 --> 24:39.578
Lucas?

24:39.678 --> 24:42.147
Hey, uh, Lindsay.
You remember--

24:42.247 --> 24:43.648
Darby Spencer!
Yeah!

24:43.748 --> 24:45.484
I thought you were in the city.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.752
I was.
I mean, I am.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.020
I am.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.722
Well, come on.
We better go.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.924
I've only got an hour
and we have to visit the florist

24:53.024 --> 24:54.493
and the photographer. Okay.

24:54.593 --> 24:55.727
Wait, are you two...?

24:55.827 --> 24:58.163
Getting married
in the fall!

24:58.263 --> 24:59.364
Can you believe it?

24:59.464 --> 25:01.566
Someone finally landed
the most eligible bachelor

25:01.666 --> 25:04.636
in Alder Bluffs.

25:04.736 --> 25:05.904
Finally!

25:06.004 --> 25:08.373
Wow!
Congratulations!

25:08.473 --> 25:09.608
Oh my gosh.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.843
No, now I see it now,
now that you've said it,

25:11.943 --> 25:14.946
because you both have very
similar levels of attractiveness

25:15.046 --> 25:17.315
and great face...

25:17.415 --> 25:18.550
bones.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.853
So, uh, that's awesome for you,
and I'm gonna go.

25:21.953 --> 25:25.056
But congratulations again,
and good to see you.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.692
See you, Darby.

25:27.792 --> 25:31.029
Bye!
Bye!

25:36.034 --> 25:37.135
ED meds?

25:37.235 --> 25:38.136
Really?

25:38.236 --> 25:39.204
Mm-hm.

25:39.304 --> 25:40.605
Okay, I guess
that's why he didn't want

25:40.705 --> 25:42.841
to answer any of the questions
about the drugs he was using.

25:42.941 --> 25:43.842
Yeah.

25:43.942 --> 25:44.976
So we're back to square one.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.611
Oh, no,
we're just getting started!

25:46.711 --> 25:48.680
Who's Michael Fletcher?

25:48.780 --> 25:50.482
He's listed on
the team's roster,

25:50.582 --> 25:51.583
but you didn't interview him.

25:51.683 --> 25:52.817
Yeah, that guy.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.819
It's just some player they
recruited out of Vancouver.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.921
Recruited?

25:56.021 --> 25:57.589
Yeah, sometimes
the university will waive

25:57.689 --> 25:59.991
bad grades in order
to bring in a star player.

26:00.091 --> 26:03.194
Your talent alone buys
you a spot on the team.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.629
You know what?
I never found him.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.065
He was never at practice
or any of the games, so...

26:07.165 --> 26:08.466
Well, why not?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.236
Coach Hammond said he tore
his Achilles and went back home.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.071
Look, I already tried
to follow it up,

26:13.171 --> 26:15.140
but the coach wouldn't
give me his contact info.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.107
Weird.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.275
Yeah.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.078
I think I know where
we might be able to get it.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.813
Michael Fletcher?
Never heard of him.

26:21.913 --> 26:22.981
Your teammate?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.216
From Vancouver?
With the torn Achilles?

26:25.317 --> 26:26.618
What are
you talking about?

26:26.718 --> 26:29.421
There's never been anyone on
the team named Michael Fletcher.

26:29.521 --> 26:30.689
And who are you guys, anyway?

26:30.789 --> 26:32.324
You know,
you're suspiciously short

26:32.424 --> 26:33.291
to be a basketball player.

26:33.391 --> 26:35.594
I think you're lying.
And she is a cop.

26:35.694 --> 26:36.995
She doesn't look like a cop,

26:37.095 --> 26:38.763
and I don't know
a Michael Fletcher.

26:38.863 --> 26:39.965
Show him your badge.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.499
It's fine, Mom.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.335
We need to find out
about Michael Fletcher!

26:43.435 --> 26:44.469
No, we will.
We're good.

26:44.569 --> 26:46.037
Thank you for your time, Jerome. Thanks.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.339
Okay, what was that all about?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.673
Let's just leave it alone.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.275
Why wouldn't you
show him your badge?

26:50.375 --> 26:51.343
Did you... forget it?

26:51.443 --> 26:52.577
No, I didn't forget it!

26:52.677 --> 26:53.945
Okay.

26:54.045 --> 26:57.315
Darby Amelia, you have been in
a bad mood since you got home.

26:57.415 --> 26:59.484
Have I ever been
in a good mood at home?

26:59.584 --> 27:00.552
Okay, fine.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.854
What, did you have
a fight with Chad?

27:02.954 --> 27:05.357
Chase!

27:05.457 --> 27:09.995
Chase "windmilled"
a woman with veneers.

27:10.095 --> 27:11.162
Windmilled?

27:11.262 --> 27:12.197
What?

27:12.297 --> 27:15.033
He cheated on me, Mom!

27:15.133 --> 27:16.334
What--
he's a loser!

27:16.434 --> 27:18.336
That doesn't matter.
It must be something else.

27:18.436 --> 27:19.638
Did something happen at work?

27:19.738 --> 27:22.340
I quit!

27:22.440 --> 27:24.009
I have nothing now.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.644
Are you happy?

27:25.744 --> 27:27.912
You never wanted me to be
a cop in the first place.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.881
Are you surprised?

27:29.981 --> 27:32.083
Your father died
in the line of duty.

27:32.183 --> 27:33.218
I worry about you.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.186
I worry about you
every single day.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.055
Give me a break!

27:37.155 --> 27:38.323
You left me.

27:38.423 --> 27:39.724
Stop pretending that you care.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.159
Of course I care.

27:41.259 --> 27:42.293
You're my daughter.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.461
I am your mother.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.263
No, you're not!

27:45.363 --> 27:48.867
Mom, you are Victoria Spencer,

27:48.967 --> 27:52.637
the five-time Agatha Award
winner for...

27:52.737 --> 27:56.608
whatever.

27:56.708 --> 28:00.111
I never should have
come back here.

28:00.211 --> 28:01.346
Darby...

28:01.446 --> 28:02.580
Face it, Mom,

28:02.681 --> 28:04.849
we don't belong together.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.185
We never have...

28:07.285 --> 28:09.621
We never will.

28:09.721 --> 28:13.324
Not even you can rewrite that.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.011
I have it.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.979
Thank you.

28:38.483 --> 28:39.851
Did you get any sleep?

28:39.951 --> 28:41.386
Hmm, not really.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.321
This is the world's
tiniest blanket.

28:44.589 --> 28:46.257
But it's the least
of my concerns.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.992
You want to talk about it?

28:48.093 --> 28:49.527
What's to talk about?

28:49.627 --> 28:52.363
She's a judgemental narcissist
who's never supported me

28:52.464 --> 28:56.067
a single day in her life.

28:56.167 --> 29:00.105
So... uh, you're not
gonna like hearing this,

29:00.205 --> 29:03.508
but we think you're
too hard on Victoria.

29:03.608 --> 29:06.077
I'm hard?

29:06.177 --> 29:07.245
Have you met her?

29:07.345 --> 29:09.080
Darby, she talks
about you all the time.

29:09.180 --> 29:12.250
She wishes
she could see you more.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.351
She's lonely!

29:13.451 --> 29:15.086
She's manipulative.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.922
And she's only nice to you guys
so she can undermine me.

29:18.022 --> 29:19.157
Why are you taking her side?

29:19.257 --> 29:20.258
Darby--
We're not--

29:20.358 --> 29:21.493
No, I'm serious.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.462
You guys don't know what
it was like for me growing up.

29:24.562 --> 29:27.532
After my dad died, my mom
buried herself in her writing,

29:27.632 --> 29:30.301
and next thing I knew she was
off flying all over the world

29:30.401 --> 29:31.770
promoting her books.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.706
She completely abandoned me.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.076
And then she'd swan in,
no apology,

29:38.176 --> 29:41.012
and try to buy her way back into
my life with some stupid gift

29:41.112 --> 29:45.416
she bought in, like,
I don't know, Belgium.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.388
What's the matter?

29:50.488 --> 29:52.423
She'd buy her way in...

29:52.524 --> 29:54.592
Yeah, you were in the middle
of making that point.

29:54.692 --> 29:57.595
I gotta go!

29:57.695 --> 30:00.098
Uh, dinosaur?
Dinosaur!

30:07.338 --> 30:10.441
Mom?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.977
Mom?

30:27.992 --> 30:29.727
Hmm...

30:29.828 --> 30:30.895
Ooh...

30:30.995 --> 30:33.064
"Though once a maven
in the world of mystery,

30:33.164 --> 30:35.400
"Victoria Spencer may
have finally reached her

30:35.500 --> 30:38.503
"sell-by date."

30:38.603 --> 30:39.604
Mom?

30:39.704 --> 30:41.873
No, wait!

30:41.973 --> 30:44.008
Mom!
Mom, wait.

30:44.108 --> 30:46.110
You had no business
snooping around in there!

30:46.211 --> 30:47.312
I'm sorry!
I wasn't snooping.

30:47.412 --> 30:48.413
I was looking for you.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.747
Well, you must be thrilled.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.049
It's what you always wanted!

30:51.149 --> 30:53.351
Your overbearing mother
being put back in her place.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.787
That's not what I wanted.

30:55.887 --> 30:57.922
Okay, I sometimes wanted it,

30:58.022 --> 30:59.390
but I didn't
picture it like this.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.192
Well, now you know
my career is over.

31:01.292 --> 31:02.627
Those reviews are right:

31:02.727 --> 31:04.462
my last novel was a dud.

31:04.562 --> 31:05.964
I'm sure it's not that bad.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.098
How would you know?

31:07.198 --> 31:09.367
You've never even read
a single one of my books.

31:09.467 --> 31:11.870
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

31:11.970 --> 31:14.505
when everybody thinks that
you're completely washed up?

31:14.606 --> 31:15.707
This is all I know how to do,

31:15.807 --> 31:19.177
and I haven't written
a word in months!

31:19.277 --> 31:22.680
I'm sorry, Mom.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.849
What is it that you
wanted me for, anyway?

31:24.949 --> 31:26.117
I had a thought about the case.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.819
Michael Fletcher is a fake?

31:27.919 --> 31:29.153
Yeah, how did you know?

31:29.254 --> 31:30.388
I thought it was weird

31:30.488 --> 31:32.690
that Jerome didn't
know who he was,

31:32.790 --> 31:35.159
so I called Kaia, she gave me
the name of his high school--

31:35.260 --> 31:37.328
turns out there never was
a student with that name.

31:37.428 --> 31:38.663
That's so smart.

31:38.763 --> 31:39.864
There was, however,

31:39.964 --> 31:42.166
a student named
Michael Everwood,

31:42.267 --> 31:45.203
middle name Fletcher,
who was accepted into Alderview

31:45.303 --> 31:47.839
last fall, but he wasn't
a basketball player,

31:47.939 --> 31:48.873
or even a good student.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.208
That's it.

31:50.308 --> 31:51.209
He's the one.

31:51.309 --> 31:52.277
The one... what?

31:52.377 --> 31:54.312
It's an admissions scam, Mom.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.313
Oh...

31:55.413 --> 31:57.282
Think about it.
Michael Everwood,

31:57.382 --> 31:58.850
who they've renamed
Michael Fletcher,

31:58.950 --> 32:01.019
gets recruited by
a championship team,

32:01.119 --> 32:02.787
even though he doesn't
play basketball?

32:02.887 --> 32:04.989
That doesn't make any sense. Unless...

32:05.089 --> 32:07.058
The coach was taking bribes!

32:07.158 --> 32:08.226
Exactly.

32:08.326 --> 32:10.695
He's selling access
to the university

32:10.795 --> 32:11.963
through the recruitment system.

32:12.063 --> 32:14.666
And he got spooked when Kaia
asked him about Michael

32:14.766 --> 32:16.601
because it threatened
to expose his scheme.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.003
Well, how do we prove it?

32:19.103 --> 32:21.105
We need to get a copy
of Michael Fletcher's

32:21.205 --> 32:22.507
fake student file.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.542
Maybe there's something
in there that links him back

32:24.642 --> 32:25.743
to the real Michael Everwood.

32:25.843 --> 32:28.279
Okay, you do that,
and I'll go talk to the coach.

32:28.379 --> 32:29.180
What?
No!

32:29.280 --> 32:30.415
No way.
Uh-uh.

32:30.515 --> 32:32.083
Yeah, all I have to do
is convince him

32:32.183 --> 32:33.618
that I am the mother
of a student

32:33.718 --> 32:35.987
who needs the same
arrangement as Michael.

32:36.087 --> 32:36.955
Okay?

32:37.055 --> 32:38.389
No, Mom, that's crazy!

32:38.489 --> 32:40.458
Honey, I can handle it, alright?

32:40.558 --> 32:41.726
Don't worry.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.227
Okay, but...

32:43.328 --> 32:45.763
take Kaia with you
and have her wait in the car.

32:45.863 --> 32:47.865
I want a witness there
in case the coach decides

32:47.966 --> 32:50.001
to make this
a sudden death round.

32:50.101 --> 32:51.803
Good idea.

32:55.039 --> 32:55.540
this is what a coach's salary

32:58.076 --> 33:01.312
and years of bribes gets you.

33:01.412 --> 33:05.616
Okay, I've got my handy digital
recording device in my purse.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.651
Alright...

33:06.751 --> 33:08.619
Victoria, are you
sure about this?

33:08.720 --> 33:11.222
Relax.
I am going to be fine.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.824
Just sit tight.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.259
And for God's sake,
stay out of sight!

33:26.237 --> 33:27.438
Dr. Cagney?

33:27.538 --> 33:33.011
Are you in there?

33:33.111 --> 33:36.014
Okay, great...

33:36.114 --> 33:39.050
Now I'm committing crimes.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.818
Awesome influence, Mom.

33:48.993 --> 33:51.629
Dr. Cagney?

34:01.372 --> 34:03.975
Password.

34:04.075 --> 34:06.511
Um...

34:06.611 --> 34:08.713
"Alderview."

34:16.054 --> 34:21.926
Norval painting auction...

34:22.026 --> 34:23.394
"Norval"?

34:23.494 --> 34:26.431
N-O-R-V-A-L.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.800
Yes!

34:32.370 --> 34:33.771
Nice house.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.506
Thank you.

34:35.606 --> 34:38.543
Thank you so much for
seeing me on such short notice.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.844
Not at all.

34:39.944 --> 34:42.380
You said on the phone this was
something about your son?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.449
Yes.
My son, Chase.

34:44.549 --> 34:47.552
He's not the brightest bulb,
I'm afraid.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.921
As his mother, I would
never use the word "loser,"

34:50.021 --> 34:51.422
but it has been floated...

34:51.522 --> 34:53.291
I get it,
I get it.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.793
Uh, I don't understand
what it is you want me to do.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.729
Oh, well, Paul Everwood
is a friend of mine.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.099
I do believe you know his son,
Michael?

35:01.199 --> 35:02.967
Yeah, sure.
Uh, good kid.

35:03.067 --> 35:04.035
Mm-hm.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.404
Paul told me that you
were able to help him

35:06.504 --> 35:08.539
get his son
enrolled in Alderview.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.074
Well...

35:10.174 --> 35:12.577
That was just a favour...
for a friend.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.946
He wasn't supposed
to tell you that.

35:15.046 --> 35:17.582
Athletic scholarships...

35:17.682 --> 35:19.050
Basketball...

35:19.150 --> 35:23.087
Fletcher.

35:23.187 --> 35:26.057
Michael Fletcher...

35:30.461 --> 35:33.931
Michael Fletcher Everwood!

35:34.031 --> 35:36.234
Dr. Cagney?

35:36.334 --> 35:37.835
Oh, no!

35:37.935 --> 35:39.604
No, no, no,
don't blame Paul.

35:39.704 --> 35:42.607
I practically
forced it out of him.

35:42.707 --> 35:46.010
But I would be interested
in exploring a similar

35:46.110 --> 35:47.845
arrangement for my son.

35:47.945 --> 35:51.782
I would happily
compensate you for any...

35:51.883 --> 35:55.653
unusual expenses
that might arise.

35:58.789 --> 35:59.891
Oh, damn it!

35:59.991 --> 36:02.860
You've reached Victoria Spencer.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.295
Come on.

36:06.130 --> 36:06.998
Hey.

36:07.098 --> 36:08.366
Kaia, listen to me.

36:08.466 --> 36:10.835
Dr. Cagney is in on it!

36:10.935 --> 36:11.836
What?

36:11.936 --> 36:12.970
Yeah, my phone's dying,

36:13.070 --> 36:15.039
but I need you to get through
to my mom, okay?

36:15.139 --> 36:17.241
Keep trying her.
She has to get out of there.

36:17.341 --> 36:18.743
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no!

36:18.843 --> 36:20.044
What is it?
What's wrong?

36:20.144 --> 36:22.046
Darby...
She's here.

36:22.146 --> 36:23.514
Dr. Cagney?

36:23.614 --> 36:24.682
She's in the driveway.

36:24.782 --> 36:26.250
Well, you can't
let her go in there.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.818
She knows my mom!

36:27.919 --> 36:29.086
How am I supposed
to stop her?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.855
I don't know!

36:30.955 --> 36:33.424
Okay, Kaia, I need
you to do one thing.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.060
Well, you see,
my dying husband, Octavius,

36:36.160 --> 36:38.362
beckoned me to his bedside
and he whispered

36:38.462 --> 36:40.665
just one word to me...

36:40.765 --> 36:42.466
"Alderview!"

36:42.567 --> 36:44.569
Then I realized I was
going to have to use

36:44.669 --> 36:46.537
his substantial fortune

36:46.637 --> 36:50.942
to ensure his
dying wish for his son.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.810
Okay!

36:52.910 --> 36:54.679
Okay?

36:54.779 --> 36:58.216
"Okay" as in you'll get
my son into Alderview

36:58.316 --> 36:59.850
in exchange for money?

36:59.951 --> 37:02.186
Uh, I do have
to text my partner first.

37:02.286 --> 37:03.421
Excuse me.

37:03.521 --> 37:05.456
Fine!

37:05.556 --> 37:07.058
Dr. Cagney?

37:07.158 --> 37:08.359
Dr. Cagney!

37:08.459 --> 37:09.961
Hey, wait!

37:10.061 --> 37:13.197
I... need to talk to you
about my expulsion.

37:13.297 --> 37:15.066
How did you even know
I would be here?

37:15.166 --> 37:16.200
This is inappropriate.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.636
Listen, I have to graduate.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.938
This is everything
I've been working toward.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.873
There's nothing I can do.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.510
I'm sorry.

37:29.213 --> 37:30.848
Oh, wow!

37:30.948 --> 37:32.783
Uh, yeah,
it's beautiful, isn't it?

37:32.883 --> 37:34.418
It's a gift from my partner.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.787
Some Narval something?

37:36.887 --> 37:38.089
Oh...

37:38.189 --> 37:39.890
Hey, babe,
I brought dinner!

37:39.991 --> 37:43.394
There you are,
right on cue!

37:43.494 --> 37:45.763
Oh, Victoria!

37:45.863 --> 37:47.131
You know each other?

37:47.231 --> 37:49.767
Well, of course.
This is Victoria Spencer.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.102
The author.

37:51.202 --> 37:52.737
What are you doing here?

37:52.837 --> 37:54.138
She wants help with her son

37:54.238 --> 37:55.740
to get into Alderview.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.208
Oh, her son?

37:57.308 --> 37:59.310
Victoria doesn't have a son.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.746
You know, this is just
a misunderstanding.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.314
I'm gonna go. Wait.

38:03.414 --> 38:04.448
Did you bring Kaia here?

38:04.548 --> 38:05.583
Uh...

38:05.683 --> 38:06.984
How much have you told her?

38:07.084 --> 38:08.986
I... I don't know.
We were just talking.

38:09.086 --> 38:10.755
Ugh!

38:10.855 --> 38:12.290
Is that necessary?

38:12.390 --> 38:15.326
Oh, you idiot!
She was recording you!

38:15.426 --> 38:17.662
What are we gonna do?

38:17.762 --> 38:20.631
Well, I just erased it,
and that was her only proof.

38:20.731 --> 38:24.635
Besides, everyone knows Victoria
has a very active imagination.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.804
I think this news won't
be leaving this house,

38:26.904 --> 38:27.905
now, will it, Victoria?

38:28.005 --> 38:29.774
No.
I promise I won't say a thing.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.076
But I will.
Honey, no, stop--

38:32.176 --> 38:34.011
No, no, don't worry, Mom.
I've got this.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.514
Look what I found in
Michael Fletcher's student file.

38:36.614 --> 38:39.383
It's a medical assessment
of Michael Everwood,

38:39.483 --> 38:41.786
the real Michael,
stating that he has

38:41.886 --> 38:43.621
a congenital heart condition
and can't participate

38:43.721 --> 38:44.855
in strenuous activities.

38:44.955 --> 38:47.358
Which is a little odd
for a star basketball player,

38:47.458 --> 38:48.592
don't you think?

38:48.693 --> 38:50.261
Hmph!
So what?

38:50.361 --> 38:52.863
All that file proves
is that I was deceived

38:52.963 --> 38:54.298
by a bogus application.

38:54.398 --> 38:56.500
Hey, you-- don't
throw me under the bus on this.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.669
Hey...
the truth is you have nothing.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.905
You have no financial records,
no documentation,

39:01.005 --> 39:04.508
no evidence whatsoever to
prove that we accepted bribes.

39:04.608 --> 39:07.211
Michael's never going to say
a word and the only other people

39:07.311 --> 39:09.647
who know anything about it
are standing right here

39:09.747 --> 39:13.050
in this room, so...

39:13.150 --> 39:15.052
You sure?

39:15.152 --> 39:17.188
You get all that, Zane?

39:17.288 --> 39:19.457
Loud and clear.

39:19.557 --> 39:20.991
How...?

39:21.092 --> 39:22.493
There's nothing I can do.

39:22.593 --> 39:26.030
I'm sorry.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.808
As a wise detective
once told me,

39:37.908 --> 39:40.878
"Always have a backup plan."

39:43.347 --> 39:44.515
Kaia!

39:44.615 --> 39:47.852
It worked.
Aww!

39:49.487 --> 39:49.754
that's amazing.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.090
Congrats again, Kaia.

39:53.190 --> 39:54.892
Okay, bye.

39:54.992 --> 39:56.260
What was
that all about?

39:56.360 --> 39:58.095
Kaia got
the job at HuffPost.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.097
They want her to write
an in-depth article

40:00.197 --> 40:02.233
about the entire
bribery scandal.

40:02.333 --> 40:05.603
I hope they mention us:
The Spencer Sisters.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.139
That's not a thing.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.941
Honey, you don't
have to rush off.

40:11.041 --> 40:14.478
I have a very special bottle
of champagne I bought in Paris.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.746
We could share it.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.149
Thanks, Mom, but...

40:18.249 --> 40:21.786
I do have stuff
I have to take care of.

40:21.886 --> 40:24.488
I understand.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.496
It was good to see you.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.132
I... had...

40:35.232 --> 40:37.802
fun.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.670
Good.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.339
Maybe you'll come back
again, soon.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.542
I will.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.945
Promise.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.354
Okay...

40:57.455 --> 40:59.323
