08:20.601 --> 08:22.801

08:22.803 --> 08:24.002

That party island that's in
all the tv commercials.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.143

08:32.145 --> 08:34.513
And then work there
as a security guard.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.848
Wait. You'd buy an island
and then work on it?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.317

Just part-time, okay?

08:39.319 --> 08:42.454

I'd lay around on that beach,

08:42.456 --> 08:45.624

08:45.626 --> 08:47.359
Ooh, and then
I'd order the staff around.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.960
I'd be like, "hey.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.562
"go on the other side
of that island

08:50.564 --> 08:52.297
And get me a pineapple."
and they'd be like,

08:52.299 --> 08:55.867
(jamaican accent): "right away,
ms. Hemphill, right away."

08:55.869 --> 08:59.004

"mm, don't worry about it.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.207

right here is just fine.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.088

09:17.090 --> 09:19.357

pretty ridiculous.

09:19.359 --> 09:22.127

largest number you can imagine.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.697
$1 million.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.699

number you can imagine?

09:27.701 --> 09:29.100

09:29.102 --> 09:31.102

09:31.104 --> 09:32.904

09:34.908 --> 09:37.075
I'd give you $3 million

09:37.077 --> 09:39.044
If you could prove
zayday is the killer?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.879
I would say, "denise hemphill

"from secure enforcement
solutions

09:42.683 --> 09:44.749

09:49.756 --> 09:52.757
My mother used to say that
smugness gives you wrinkles.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.192
Oh. Was I being smug?

09:54.194 --> 09:56.061
Sorry, I thought I was
just being right.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.463
Let me lay out
a hypothetical for you.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.532
In this state, there's
no statute of limitations

10:00.534 --> 10:01.900
For homicide.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.436
Now, hypothetically,
if I was at kappa that night,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.104
And I did, hypothetically,

10:06.106 --> 10:08.974
Cover up this
hypothetical negligent homicide,

10:08.976 --> 10:10.909
I would hypothetically
not be responsible

10:10.911 --> 10:12.711
For that girl's death.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.946
But I would
hypothetically undoubtedly

10:14.948 --> 10:17.048
Be an accessory after the fact.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.718
So when these
murders started up,

10:19.720 --> 10:21.720
Even if I hypothetically thought
they were related

10:21.722 --> 10:25.090
To the events of 20 years ago,
I couldn't, hypothetically,

10:25.092 --> 10:27.993
Start offering up information
to the...

10:27.995 --> 10:30.929
Hypothetical police,
or anyone else, for that matter,

10:30.931 --> 10:35.467
Because I risk, hypothetically,
implicating myself.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.068
Hypothetically, of course.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.970
So instead, you'd let him
just keep killing people,

10:38.972 --> 10:39.938
Your students,

10:39.940 --> 10:41.139
Just to protect yourself.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.475
I just figured...

10:43.477 --> 10:45.777
That eventually someone
would shoot the bastard.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.079
Now it's different,
because they came after you.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.248
Hell yeah, it is!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.984
This school could survive
a few serial killings,

10:52.986 --> 10:55.086
But I really don't think
that this university

10:55.088 --> 10:57.756
Could handle losing me.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.190
Neither can I, frankly.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.962
This is the name

11:03.964 --> 11:07.132
Of the girl who died
in the tub.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.834
But that's not enough.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.670
I need to know
everything.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.871
What happened to the baby?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.272
Where are all the other girls
who were there?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.273
I don't know.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.641
Cover-ups like this only work

11:16.643 --> 11:18.176
If everyone has
tiny bits of info.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.944
One of the girls
took the baby.

11:19.946 --> 11:23.148
I don't know where she went,
what happened after that.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.616
This name is all I have.

11:24.618 --> 11:28.086
The rest, as they say,
sherlock, is up to you.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.727
What? Is there a problem?

11:35.729 --> 11:38.029
Um, no. It's just...

11:38.031 --> 11:40.365
Are you sure
that that's her name?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.200
Because my mom's name
was mulligan.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.968
That's what my dad told me.

11:43.970 --> 11:48.707
Do you know what I find the
most appalling thing about you?

11:48.709 --> 11:52.310
You act like you are this
benevolent champion of justice,

11:52.312 --> 11:54.145
When really,

11:54.147 --> 11:57.415
At the end of the day,
this is just about you

11:57.417 --> 12:00.919
Finding out who your mommy is.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.921
I want to stop these murders!

12:02.923 --> 12:05.090
But I also have a right
to find out

12:05.092 --> 12:06.658
If I'm the reason
they're happening.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.227
Do you know why I never
went into therapy?

12:09.229 --> 12:13.031
Because the less we know
about ourselves, the better.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.666
Rummaging around
in your life--

12:14.668 --> 12:16.501
It's like digging
through a landfill.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.904
Sure, you may happen upon
something interesting,

12:19.906 --> 12:22.173
But you're gonna get filthy.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.951
No, no, no, no, no!

12:32.953 --> 12:35.053
Crap. I'm gonna kill
that dumb bitch.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.921
Denise: Whoa. What dumb
bitch you gonna kill?

12:36.923 --> 12:38.523
The girl
at candle junction

12:38.525 --> 12:43.061
Who evidently doesn't understand
the concept of a "22 for

12:43.063 --> 12:44.362
The price of 20 sale."

12:44.364 --> 12:46.965
So I'm like,
"well, now my year is ruined."

12:46.967 --> 12:48.700
Fascinating.

12:48.702 --> 12:51.069
Listen, let me ask you
a couple of questions

12:51.071 --> 12:52.437
About zayday williams.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.905
Zayday? She's really nice.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.273
There's no way she's the killer.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.975
Damn. Why you say that?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.943
Total lack of evidence.
She displays none of

12:58.945 --> 13:00.245
The characteristics
of a serial killer.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.946
She's kind,
she's responsible,

13:01.948 --> 13:04.048
She has a great set
of social skills

13:04.050 --> 13:05.316
And a healthy network
of friends.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.886
I have no reason to believe
she's the killer.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.456
I got three million reasons
to believe she<i> is</i> the killer.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.225
Well, except there was
that one time.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.326
She could tell

13:15.328 --> 13:16.828
That I wasn't fitting in

13:16.830 --> 13:19.497
With the girls at kappa house,
so she told me this story.

13:19.499 --> 13:20.999
I definitely know
what it feels like

13:21.001 --> 13:22.467
To not be one of
the cool kids.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.135
There was this group
of girls at my school.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.004
They called themselves
the peacocks.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.741
They were rich and wore
all the nicest clothes.

13:29.743 --> 13:32.577
And then one day, one of them
told me, the following day,

13:32.579 --> 13:34.445
I should dress up
in my fanciest outfit

13:34.447 --> 13:36.080
And sit with them at lunch.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.148
So what happened?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.150
Zayday:
<i>They spent the whole time</i>

13:39.152 --> 13:40.852
<i>Making fun of my outfit,</i>

13:40.854 --> 13:43.121
<i>Talking about</i>
<i>how cheap my clothes were.</i>

13:43.123 --> 13:45.323
<i>And you know</i>
<i>how desperate I was?</i>

13:45.325 --> 13:47.926
<i>I sat there and laughed</i>
<i>right along with them.</i>

13:47.928 --> 13:50.495
(laughing)

13:50.497 --> 13:54.132
But it was that day I decided
I was gonna figure out a way

13:54.134 --> 13:57.368
To get revenge on entitled
little rich girls everywhere.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.938
And not just a little revenge.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.573
Real revenge.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.945
She said that?
She said, "real revenge"?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.146
Uh-huh.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.515
You know, I didn't think
anything of it at the time,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.116
But now looking back on it,

14:12.118 --> 14:13.985
I guess she could be
a serial...
(door creaks)

14:13.987 --> 14:15.453
Could be what?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.188
A serial killer?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.657
Hey, there.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.159
You know, maybe next time,

14:21.161 --> 14:22.694
You should check the bathroom
before you decide

14:22.696 --> 14:24.162
To tell personal stories
about your suite-mate,

14:24.164 --> 14:26.130
Because I heard
every single thing you said.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.398
Yeah, jennifer!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.400
As for you, ms. Hemphill,

14:29.402 --> 14:31.536
I'm getting real tired
of your nonsense.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.404
You make me wish
I was a serial killer

14:33.406 --> 14:36.341
Just so I could knock off
your black ass next.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.076
If you want
to accuse me of something,

14:38.078 --> 14:39.911
Walk your ass down
to the police station

14:39.913 --> 14:41.179
And get yourself a warrant.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.714
Until then,

14:42.716 --> 14:46.084
You better stay away from me,
you hear me?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.052
That goes for both of you.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.595
Jennifer:
<i>Anyway, so I went back</i>

14:57.597 --> 15:00.732
<i>To the candle junction</i>
<i>at the three hills mall,</i>

15:00.734 --> 15:02.667
And the girl was like, "sorry.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.036
"we<i> did</i> have mrs. Claus's
cinnamon browneye in the back.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.005
"it was just hidden behind
a whole bunch of stuff

15:07.007 --> 15:08.940
Because it's seasonal."

15:08.942 --> 15:11.276
Seasonal?

15:11.278 --> 15:14.112
Anyways, the first thing you're
gonna notice about this candle,

15:14.114 --> 15:16.381
Like the rita moreno
daiquiri hangover,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.683
Is that it has a sturdy wick.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.218
(door creaks)

15:20.220 --> 15:22.420
Guys, I'm recording.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.222
(scoffs)
sorry.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.124
So, as far as fragrance goes,

15:26.126 --> 15:28.059
I get a lot of pine
alongside the peppermint,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.861
Which is so sophisticated

15:29.863 --> 15:32.430
And part of what makes
this holiday series so special.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.234
See? You can already tell
from the quality of the wax

15:36.236 --> 15:38.536
That this candle is gonna have
a nice even burn.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.038
And believe me,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
That's exactly what you're gonna
want as the holidays

15:42.042 --> 15:43.942
Roll around.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.044
So, what's the verdict
on this one, you guys?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.979
(singsongy):
Um, shocker!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.847
I give it... Five stars.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.520
(computer beeping rapidly)

16:03.964 --> 16:06.965
All right, ladies, I want to
update you on my investigation

16:06.967 --> 16:11.402
Into proving that
zayday williams is the killer.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.137
I... Got...

16:13.139 --> 16:14.339
Nothing.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.840
Excuse me?

16:15.842 --> 16:17.842
Except for the fact
that she gave me

16:17.844 --> 16:20.578
And that weird candle girl
some real bad stink-eye,

16:20.580 --> 16:21.946
Then told us to
leave her alone.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.247
But that's all I got.

16:23.249 --> 16:26.084
My investigation
has been lacking

16:26.086 --> 16:28.820
In the financial resources
department.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.423
Right now, this whole thing has
been funded out of my pocket.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.159
So I was wondering if I could
get a little advance.

16:35.161 --> 16:38.096
Let's say ten percent
of that three million?

16:38.098 --> 16:40.264
(sighs) fine.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.466
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:41.468 --> 16:43.134
I have a date with my boyfriend
chad radwell.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.803
Tonight's our night of
a thousand compliments night.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.305
What does that mean?
We sit across from one another,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.874
Fully clothed, and he
compliments me a thousand times.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.444
You got a hot mouth.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.746
Thank you.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.050
That mouth would look
even better if it was kissing

16:59.052 --> 17:00.685
All over my rippling pecs
and my rock-hard abs.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.022
Okay, chad, that's you
complimenting yourself.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.558
That outfit-- amazing.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.960
Thank you.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.661
That outfit--
it would look even better

17:10.663 --> 17:12.230
Just rolled up
in a little ball

17:12.232 --> 17:13.798
In the corner
of my bedroom.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.034
Okay, chad,
that's not a compliment.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.637
That outfit looks
super absorbent enough

17:19.639 --> 17:21.806
To wipe down this hot bod
after an hour-long bone sesh.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.741
These aren't compliments, chad!

17:23.743 --> 17:25.743
I'm trying! Okay?!

17:26.913 --> 17:31.315
Compliment night is...
Sort of a work in progress.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.718
Right, right. Hold on.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.054
That $300,000-- how exactly
am I gonna get that?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.189
I don't know. Call
bachmann, selz & selz.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.924
They're my family's
money managers.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.692
Ask for elaine.
She's my point person.

17:41.694 --> 17:45.163
Right, but is there any way
they can give it to me in cash?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.498
What is that smell? Does anyone
else smell something burning?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.100
Yeah. What is that?

17:50.336 --> 17:52.904
Oh, my god!

17:56.609 --> 18:00.411
(all screaming)

18:01.514 --> 18:04.082
Grace:
<i>There has to be something.</i>

18:04.084 --> 18:07.518
If I had a social security
number, then maybe.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.120
But otherwise, this
girl's a total phantom.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.688
No. This cannot be
another dead end!

18:10.690 --> 18:11.923
We have her name.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.758
There has to be
a photo of her online

18:13.760 --> 18:15.359
Or a relative
we can find or something.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.528
(sighs)

18:19.966 --> 18:21.499
That's my mom.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.102
I-I know it. I can just feel it.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.105
Ever since this all started,
I've known that I was that baby.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.041
When I was little...

18:30.043 --> 18:31.342
I would talk to her.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.113
And I could just
feel her there with me.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.382
A benevolent spirit.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.384
But there was also
a sadness there,

18:40.386 --> 18:42.253
A longing,
some unfinished business

18:42.255 --> 18:45.256
That was keeping her
from moving on.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.059
That's why I came to this school
and joined kappa.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.495
Because I had this feeling
that I could finish it for her.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.297
This<i> is</i> that business.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.434
We need to find my mom
and end all of this.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.402
Dear strange, odd,
candle-loving jennifer

18:58.404 --> 18:59.971
Needs to be the final victim.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.772
The madness needs to end.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.176
Okay, okay, so maybe
the name isn't step one.

19:05.178 --> 19:08.179
Maybe we need another step or
two before it becomes helpful.

19:08.181 --> 19:11.082
What do you mean?
The hag of shady lane.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.617
We figured that
she must have been

19:12.619 --> 19:14.085
The girl who took
the baby that night

19:14.087 --> 19:15.453
And tried to take care of it.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.155
But after a couple of years,
she disappeared, right?

19:17.157 --> 19:18.523
Yeah, she probably
ran away or something.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.757
She was a hag.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.125
She dug through
dumpsters for food

19:21.127 --> 19:23.027
And robbed milk trucks
for a living.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.962
How far could a woman
like that get?

19:24.964 --> 19:26.330
Okay, but then what happened?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.032
What happens
to all crazy people?

19:28.034 --> 19:31.135
They get arrested or...
Locked up

19:31.137 --> 19:32.403
In an insane asylum.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.181
Hey. Hi. Uh, do you remember us?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.816
Do you remember a girl who came
in here about 20 years ago?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.285
The hag of shady lane?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.488
She would have wailed a lot,
maybe had a baby with her.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.557
Yeah.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.064
Gigi?

20:00.066 --> 20:02.166
Oh, my god.
Gig's the hag of shady lane?

20:02.168 --> 20:04.902
Wait. I-I...

20:04.904 --> 20:06.537
Wait.

20:11.711 --> 20:12.977
Two babies?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.812
Boy and a girl.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.987
(flashbulbs popping)

20:28.361 --> 20:31.329
Good evening.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.897
(sighs)

20:32.899 --> 20:35.032
It is with a very heavy heart

20:35.034 --> 20:38.002
That after the continued deaths
on this campus

20:38.004 --> 20:40.338
And the mounting evidence
that they are,

20:40.340 --> 20:43.841
In fact,
the work of a serial killer,

20:43.843 --> 20:47.845
I regret to announce
the suspension of all operations

20:47.847 --> 20:50.281
Here at wallace university,
effective immediately.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.949
This evening,

20:51.951 --> 20:55.453
<i>At 8:00 p.M.,</i>
<i>out on the main quad,</i>

20:55.455 --> 20:58.456
Under a peaceful oak tree,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.691
<i>There will be a moment</i>
<i>of silence for jennifer--</i>

21:00.693 --> 21:04.195
Or as she was
more popularly known,

21:04.197 --> 21:07.932
"that very unusual girl with
the really odd candle fetish."

<i>Congratulations,</i>

21:28.988 --> 21:31.055
Red devil killer.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.823
You have won.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.459
(reporters clamoring)

21:35.461 --> 21:36.961
(clamoring stops)

21:38.898 --> 21:41.899
I will have no further comment
at this time.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.634
(reporters clamoring)

21:45.605 --> 21:47.938
This is an outrage!

21:47.940 --> 21:50.141
My whole life is ruined!

21:50.143 --> 21:52.943
Kappa house is
officially done,

21:52.945 --> 21:55.079
Which means we can't throw
any more awesome parties

21:55.081 --> 21:57.581
Where people almost die
or actually die,

21:57.583 --> 22:00.918
Which means I can't be popular,
and chad is going to leave me!

22:00.920 --> 22:02.486
You have to fix this.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.021
You have to prove that zayday

22:04.023 --> 22:07.658
And that pencil-necked grace
are the killers, and do it fast.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.927
You do realize we're detectives
from scotland yard?

22:09.929 --> 22:11.362
Um, yeah. Duh!

22:11.364 --> 22:12.963
Therefore, we have
no jurisdiction

22:12.965 --> 22:14.131
In the united states.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.299
Ms. Oberlin, you
have to understand,

22:15.301 --> 22:17.134
The only reason we're here

22:17.136 --> 22:19.036
Is because we were told
you had information

22:19.038 --> 22:21.772
Regarding a death threat against
the duchess of cambridge.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.708
First of all, I'm an american.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.210
I don't have
to understand anything.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.845
And furthermore, I
do have information

22:27.847 --> 22:29.947
Regarding a death threat against
the duchess of cambridge.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.149
If you don't prove that zayday
and grace are the killers,

22:32.151 --> 22:34.385
I'm gonna kill
the duchess myself.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.221
See, I'm not sure if
you're aware, but...

22:37.223 --> 22:40.124
I'm rich. Stupid rich.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.160
And I'm prepared to pay
handsomely to get what I want.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.962
And what I want is to see zayday

22:44.964 --> 22:47.498
And that talking
bowling ball on a stick grace

22:47.500 --> 22:49.533
Rotting in prison for
the rest of their lives.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.735
I don't care

22:50.737 --> 22:52.470
What you toothless
inbreds have to do

22:52.472 --> 22:53.671
To make that happen,

22:53.673 --> 22:55.506
Just make it happen!

22:55.508 --> 22:58.209
Now, do we have a deal?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.087
Gracie!

23:10.089 --> 23:11.555
Perfect timing.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.924
I was just about to cook us up
my mother's famous

23:13.926 --> 23:15.693
Falafel enchiladas.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.095
It's an old family recipe
which fits perfectly

23:18.097 --> 23:19.930
With the sort of vague,

23:19.932 --> 23:21.832
Enigmatic quality
of my skin tone.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.033
Hmm. You're a liar.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.735
I want the truth
about everything,

23:24.737 --> 23:27.104
And then we're going
to my dad together

23:27.106 --> 23:29.840
And you're gonna confess
it all... To him, too.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.842
Is this real?
Yes.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.944
Because that is you.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.013
It's so weird.
It does kind of look like me.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.782
What's with
the two babies though?

23:37.784 --> 23:39.016
Wait. Are you trying to hint

23:39.018 --> 23:41.218
That you want your dad and me
to have babies?

23:41.220 --> 23:43.521
Because that is... So sweet.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.723
It was drawn 20
years ago by a woman

23:45.725 --> 23:47.892
In the palmer asylum
for the insane.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.961
She remembers you being
there with two babies.

23:50.963 --> 23:54.198
Honey, have you been
smoking ayahuasca?

23:55.268 --> 23:56.434
Because pass the dutchie

23:56.436 --> 23:57.968
On the left-hand side, sister.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.304
I want some of whatever it is
you're smoking.

24:00.306 --> 24:03.073
I know that the picture
isn't proof of anything,

24:03.075 --> 24:04.809
Which is why
I went looking for more.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.143
I called the kappa
national chapter,

24:06.145 --> 24:08.078
And they e-mailed me

24:08.080 --> 24:10.047
Your resume and application
for the job as president.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.949
Honestly, they must not
have read it at all,

24:11.951 --> 24:14.151
Because it is full of
complete fabrications.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.086
Everyone exaggerates
on their resume, grace.

24:16.088 --> 24:19.089
Ooh, funny that you didn't
list the one true thing

24:19.091 --> 24:20.724
We found out about you.
What's that?

24:20.726 --> 24:23.160
According to the enrollment
files at the time,

24:23.162 --> 24:24.995
You were a student right
here at wallace university.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.565
But you dropped out after
your sophomore year for

24:27.567 --> 24:29.166
"medical reasons."

24:29.168 --> 24:30.901
But coupled with
this picture,

24:30.903 --> 24:33.304
Adds up to went nuts because
she was somehow involved

24:33.306 --> 24:35.105
With the death of
a fellow student.

24:35.107 --> 24:38.142
So you're accusing me
of being a murderer,

24:38.144 --> 24:40.110
Or an accessory to murder,

24:40.112 --> 24:42.980
Because I lied on my resume,
and 20 years ago,

24:42.982 --> 24:46.016
A crazy person painted a picture

24:46.018 --> 24:49.019
Of a girl
who sort of looks like me.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.455
Pretty flimsy.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.957
Well, it will
at least be enough

24:52.959 --> 24:54.191
To keep you away from my dad.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.260
Oh.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.929
Well, finally the truth.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.098
Look, hon...

25:01.100 --> 25:04.034
You never had a mom,
you know?

25:04.036 --> 25:06.303
Someone who can talk
to you gal to gal,

25:06.305 --> 25:07.471
Show you what's what.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.274
If you did,
she would explain to you

25:10.276 --> 25:13.010
That all the pressures you've
been under the last few weeks,

25:13.012 --> 25:15.813
Plus the fact
that your dad's finally dating,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.983
Has left you feeling
a little... Unmoored.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.151
It's all happening
way too fast.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.021
And you have been
just looking to hold on

25:24.023 --> 25:27.191
To the one thing in your life
that makes you feel safe

25:27.193 --> 25:30.160
And like a child again:
Your dad.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.963
And now you're trying
to get rid of both stresses

25:32.965 --> 25:35.966
With one slice of the knife,

25:35.968 --> 25:37.468
So to speak,

25:37.470 --> 25:39.203
Because if I'm the killer,

25:39.205 --> 25:41.572
Then the murders stop
and you get your dad back.

25:41.574 --> 25:45.876
I don't think that's gonna be
my dad's take on all this.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.678
Oh, I think my fiancé trusts me.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.014
Fiancé?

25:50.016 --> 25:52.016
Mm-hmm. Oh, I didn't show you?

25:52.018 --> 25:53.751
Beautiful, no?

25:53.753 --> 25:57.221
You'd better stay away
from my dad.

25:57.223 --> 25:58.989
Or what?

25:58.991 --> 26:01.492
You gonna kill me?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.541
Well, ms. Oberlin,
detective baxter and I

26:17.543 --> 26:19.877
Have concluded our investigation
and we've turned up

26:19.879 --> 26:21.912
Some very interesting
facts indeed.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.114
Someone has, in fact,
contemplated killing you,

26:24.116 --> 26:25.749
If not attempted it outright.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.217
Who?

26:27.219 --> 26:29.153
Your very housemate,
libby putney.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.089
You know her as chanel #5.

26:32.091 --> 26:35.125
(laughs) chanel #5's real name
is libby putney?

26:35.127 --> 26:37.094
Number five is
a frequent visitor

26:37.096 --> 26:38.963
To what we call
the deep web,

26:38.965 --> 26:40.931
Where she hosts
several active chat rooms

26:40.933 --> 26:42.700
With such names as:

26:42.702 --> 26:45.269
"does anyone want to help me
poison chanel oberlin?"

26:45.271 --> 26:47.104
Hey, stupid foreign idiots,

26:47.106 --> 26:50.074
I didn't ask you to dig up dirt
on chanel #5.

26:50.076 --> 26:53.077
Yes, but she's clearly intent
on killing you.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.713
I don't care!
What I asked you to do

26:55.715 --> 26:57.281
Is prove that grace and zayday
are the killers!

26:57.283 --> 26:59.883
With regard to ms. Williams,
there's no evidence whatsoever

26:59.885 --> 27:01.919
That she's been involved
in the campus murders

27:01.921 --> 27:04.555
Or, indeed, in any
illegal activity at all.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.924
Will you please stop peppering
your speech with "indeed"?

27:06.926 --> 27:08.626
The same can be said
for grace gardner.

27:08.628 --> 27:11.095
There's no history of suspicious
or criminal activity.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.397
The same cannot be said,
however, for her mother.

27:13.399 --> 27:14.999
Wait, what?

27:15.001 --> 27:18.335
Yes. As it turns out,
her mother has

27:18.337 --> 27:20.971
Quite the criminal record.

27:23.509 --> 27:25.009
I knew it.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.344
(chuckles)
looks like the bitch apple

27:27.346 --> 27:29.713
Doesn't fall far
from the bitch tree.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.316
Thank you, gentlemen.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.617
Grace is the killer.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.686
And this file proves it.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.095
Wes: No, no, she
just got here.

27:45.097 --> 27:47.998
I love you, too.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.833
What did she tell you?

27:51.804 --> 27:53.937
That she's... Worried about you.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.673
I'm worried about<i> you.</i>

27:55.675 --> 27:57.675
How could you get engaged?

27:57.677 --> 27:59.143
Why wouldn't you talk
to me about it first?

27:59.145 --> 28:01.111
Hey, no, I-I would never
do that to you.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.379
Look, I'm still
a little confused

28:02.381 --> 28:04.048
About what happened,
to tell you the truth.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.949
We were hanging out
here, just...

28:05.951 --> 28:08.619
Watching<i> the price is right,</i>
and she was like...

28:08.621 --> 28:10.788
Hey, would it be
too much for you

28:10.790 --> 28:12.690
If I ran to the mall
and picked up

28:12.692 --> 28:14.124
A couple things
for this place?

28:14.126 --> 28:15.526
Nothing big.

28:15.528 --> 28:16.794
I just, I don't know,

28:16.796 --> 28:18.629
I feel like it could use
a woman's touch.

28:18.631 --> 28:19.863
Mm-hmm. Um, sure, yeah.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.165
Sounds nice.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.200
I don't...
I don't want you to think

28:23.202 --> 28:24.568
I'm, like, moving too fast

28:24.570 --> 28:26.804
Or trying to cramp
your bachelor lifestyle.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.138
What?
I'm not.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.473
(laughs)
no. Of course not.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.841
Who am I, hugh hefner?

28:30.843 --> 28:32.142
(laughs)

28:32.144 --> 28:33.510
You're not hugh hefner.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.913
I know. Please, I would
love for you to do that.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.849
Cramp away.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.484
And then she came home
with an engagement ring.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.419
What?
And those lamps,

28:42.421 --> 28:44.054
Which I actually
kind of like.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.589
They are actually really nice.
Right?

28:45.591 --> 28:47.224
I mean, I always felt like
something was missing

28:47.226 --> 28:50.427
Over there, but now it just, it
feels, like, super homey here.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.995
Dad, you can't marry gigi.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.664
Honey, who said anything
about marriage?

28:53.666 --> 28:54.998
She was so excited
about the engagement.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.834
I didn't want to bum her out,

28:56.836 --> 28:58.936
So I figured if I played along
with it...

29:00.039 --> 29:02.272
...You know, it would lead
to some mind-blowing sex,

29:02.274 --> 29:03.941
Which I was totally right about.
Dad, dad!

29:03.943 --> 29:05.909
Dad! Oh, my god, please, stop.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.946
Just believe me when I tell you
that gigi is crazy.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.048
(laughs)

29:11.050 --> 29:12.783
No, she's quirky.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.184
Look, I promise you

29:14.186 --> 29:16.186
That I will not get
really serious with her

29:16.188 --> 29:17.788
Without talking to you
about it first.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.291
You're still my number one girl,
gracie.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.961
How am I supposed
to believe that?

29:23.963 --> 29:27.231
Everything you and I have
is built on a lie.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.933
I know it must be hard for you
to see me with someone else,

29:29.935 --> 29:33.570
But it's been 16 years.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.206
Don't I deserve
a little happiness, too?

29:42.381 --> 29:43.914
Wait.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.483
Gigi must have
known mom...

29:46.485 --> 29:48.619
Which means
you must have known gigi.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.954
Which means...

29:50.956 --> 29:52.890
What?

29:52.892 --> 29:55.092
What, you think I have something
to do with these murders now?

29:55.094 --> 29:57.294
Hey, please, gracie,
you're making yourself crazy.

29:57.296 --> 30:00.497
Look, just stay away
from me, dad.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.132
(sighs) come on.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.201
No, dad, stay away!

30:05.938 --> 30:08.005
(door slams)

30:20.686 --> 30:22.786
Chanel:
Hello, grace.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.155
(sighs)

30:25.157 --> 30:26.123
Why don't you have a seat?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.524
We need to discuss
the manner in which

30:27.526 --> 30:29.960
You intend to turn yourself
in to the authorities.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.995
I think it can be done
in way that will save

30:31.997 --> 30:34.198
This house and this university
a lot of embarrassment.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.967
What the hell
are you talking about?

30:36.969 --> 30:38.135
You look all sweet and cuddly,

30:38.137 --> 30:40.137
But I know for a fact
you're the killer.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.438
Deep down,

30:41.440 --> 30:44.174
You're a ruthless criminal,
just like your mother.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.277
Here are the facts.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.781
Your mother was elected
kappa house president in 1995

30:50.783 --> 30:53.350
On a campaign platform that
largely consisted of a pledge

30:53.352 --> 30:57.387
To make "waterfalls" by tlc
the official kappa house song.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.691
♪ but I think
you're moving too fast... ♪

31:00.693 --> 31:02.159
"waterfalls" is my jam!

Kappa!

31:03.829 --> 31:06.163
(crowd cheering)

31:06.165 --> 31:07.998
She really had a whale
of a time that night,

31:08.000 --> 31:10.033
Because she ended up hooking up
with one of the douche bags

31:10.035 --> 31:11.568
At the party,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.203
A douche bag by the name
of wes gardner.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.006

31:25.584 --> 31:27.050
I'm not sure if she got
knocked up that night

31:27.052 --> 31:28.518
Or a couple days after,

31:28.520 --> 31:31.321
But almost exactly
nine months later, she had you.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.157
No. No, no,
that's-that's not possible.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.192
You always suspected
you were the baby

31:35.194 --> 31:36.393
In the bathtub, didn't you?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.195
But it didn't quite
add up, did it?

31:38.197 --> 31:40.364
This, however, does:
Your mother changed her name

31:40.366 --> 31:43.567
From bethany stevens to mary
mulligan in a feeble attempt

31:43.569 --> 31:45.569
To put the sins
of her youth behind her.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.071
But I guess popping you out
drove her off the deep end,

31:48.073 --> 31:49.606
Because that's when
her criminal record

31:49.608 --> 31:51.608
Gets really interesting.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.577
She was arrested
for shoplifting, petty larceny,

31:53.579 --> 31:56.546
Grand larceny, drunk driving
with a baby in her lap,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.749
Drunk driving with a baby
on top of her car

31:58.751 --> 31:59.850
And possession
of methamphetamine

31:59.852 --> 32:01.952
With intent to distribute.

32:01.954 --> 32:03.553
Obviously appalled,
your douche bag father

32:03.555 --> 32:06.089
Sued for custody and won.

32:06.091 --> 32:09.126
Your saint of a mother
died a year later.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.295
She was driving drunk,
obviously,

32:11.297 --> 32:14.064
And decided to wrap her car
around a tree.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.633
That's a lie. My dad said
that she died in a fire.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.101
Fiery car crash.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.937
He probably wanted
to spare you the pain

32:19.939 --> 32:22.973
Of finding out
who your skank mom really was.

32:22.975 --> 32:25.475
See, do you want
to know my theory?

32:25.477 --> 32:27.911
You thought you were the baby
in the bathtub,

32:27.913 --> 32:29.746
So you decided to come back
to kappa kappa tau

32:29.748 --> 32:31.081
And kill everybody.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.282
Well, guess what, grace?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.583
You're not the baby.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.985
So you can stop
murdering everybody

32:34.987 --> 32:37.421
And accept the fact
that your dumb dead mother

32:37.423 --> 32:40.190
Was nothing more than
a drunk, degenerate slut.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.975
Then we will pick up all
the trash off the freeway.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.010
There's a couple of blind
dogs down at the pound

33:00.012 --> 33:01.945
We're gonna read
the newspaper to.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.347
Um, excuse me?
No, we're not.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.949
You can bet
your creamy white ass we are.

33:05.951 --> 33:08.118
Things gonna change
around kappa house

33:08.120 --> 33:10.153
Now that denise hemphill
is in charge.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.122
Since when
are you in charge?

33:12.124 --> 33:14.458
Since I weaseled my way
into living in this house.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.194
Um, is that my dress?

33:18.030 --> 33:20.030
Why are you wearing my clothes?!

33:20.032 --> 33:22.032
The bigger question is:
Why are you the same size

33:22.034 --> 33:23.600
As a 40-year-old woman?

33:23.602 --> 33:24.668
And you know what?

33:24.670 --> 33:28.138
I don't know what brand
of g-string

33:28.140 --> 33:30.507
It is you use,
but-but-but I feel like

33:30.509 --> 33:32.676
Angels are flossing
my butt crack.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.011
So, thank you.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.946
This is insane!

33:35.948 --> 33:38.148
You have no right to root
through our possessions

33:38.150 --> 33:39.383
And steal our things.

33:39.385 --> 33:41.385
Shut up and sit down.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.054
I'm am housemother,
and as housemother,

33:44.056 --> 33:45.489
I can do whatever I want.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.790
Housemother?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.291
What are you talking about?!

33:48.293 --> 33:49.559
Chanel, it's a coup.

33:49.561 --> 33:50.961
Chanel:
What's going on here?

33:50.963 --> 33:53.497
Wh... What in god's name
are you wearing?

33:53.499 --> 33:55.532
Chanel, she's
wearing my clothes!

33:55.534 --> 33:56.533
She's wearing
my underwear!

33:56.535 --> 33:58.001
Oh, shut up, number five.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.169
Your underwear's
probably relieved

33:59.171 --> 34:01.071

actual human genitals.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.040

Chanel,

34:08.013 --> 34:09.980
Mama denise is in charge now.

34:09.982 --> 34:11.548

34:11.550 --> 34:14.851

a nice little heart-to-heart,

34:14.853 --> 34:16.353
Just me and you.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.156
Nearest bathroom? What?
What is going on?!

34:21.393 --> 34:25.062
Let me drop a little advice
on your rich, blonde ass.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.998
I heard about
the mean things you said

34:28.000 --> 34:29.516
To grace about her mama.

34:29.517 --> 34:31.033
What I said to grace about
her mother were facts.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.602
That don't matter.

34:32.604 --> 34:35.005
You can't go around
insulting somebody's mama.

34:35.007 --> 34:36.907
Even if she was
the worst bitch in the world,

34:36.909 --> 34:38.909
You can't go around
saying it to everybody.

34:38.911 --> 34:40.677
But her mother was the
worst bitch in the world.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.012
So what?

34:42.014 --> 34:43.447
Everybody had a terrible mama.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.916
Hell, my mama was terrible,
mean as dirt.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.951
But if somebody else said

34:47.953 --> 34:49.419
My mama was a ho,

34:49.421 --> 34:51.421
I would knock
they damn block off.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.423
What am I supposed
to do, apologize?

34:53.425 --> 34:55.692
That's exactly
what I want you to do.

34:55.694 --> 34:59.029
Over my rich, hot, dead body.

34:59.031 --> 35:00.797

Okay?

37:03.922 --> 37:06.489
And I got to decide
what I thought was best for you.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.165
Mom was there that night.

37:15.167 --> 37:16.333

37:16.335 --> 37:18.868

But I really think gracie

38:20.766 --> 38:23.600
Has this superwoman complex,
you know?

38:23.602 --> 38:26.770
And her inability to keep her
friends from being picked off

38:26.772 --> 38:28.138
One by one like little indians

38:28.140 --> 38:30.907

dangerously off course.

38:35.180 --> 38:36.613
Mm-mm.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.682
I asked munsch to pull her file.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.151
She's got a 1.4 gpa.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.219
Oh, wow.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.691
She's failing
out of school, weston,

38:47.693 --> 38:50.660
And if you don't start taking
some real action--

38:50.662 --> 38:53.263
And I mean<i> real</i> action--

38:53.265 --> 38:55.799
Like maybe even...

38:55.801 --> 38:57.867
Committing her or something,

38:57.869 --> 39:00.603
Then you are really
failing her as a father.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.888
(sighs)

39:22.327 --> 39:24.627
Is that how little
you trust me?

39:24.629 --> 39:28.031
Actually, no.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.033
That's how little
I trust you.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.368
Why are we here?

39:31.370 --> 39:34.337
Are you wearing a wire to try to
get me to admit I'm the killer?

39:34.339 --> 39:35.372
I'm not.

39:35.374 --> 39:38.341
Actually, daughter of sam...

39:38.343 --> 39:40.610
I came here to apologize.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.414
Ambushing you with that stuff
about your mom was mean.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.082
Even by my standards.

39:46.084 --> 39:46.916
You see,

39:46.918 --> 39:48.685
I have an awful mother, too.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.854
Even worse than yours.

harvard oberlin,

39:57.829 --> 39:59.662
Was born with cradle cap.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.564

40:05.604 --> 40:07.070
Yuck.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.005
And then I burst
onto the scene.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.441
<i>I was mommy's</i>
<i>perfect little angel.</i>

40:11.443 --> 40:13.943
<i>Mommy said I was a prodigy</i>

<i>People's self-confidence,</i>

<i>(sobbing)</i>

40:22.020 --> 40:24.053
<i>The worst was when</i>
<i>she didn't let me go</i>

40:24.055 --> 40:26.456
<i>To my high school graduation</i>
<i>because I had a bad zit.</i>

40:26.458 --> 40:28.024
Not fair.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.560
<i>She said my deformity</i>
<i>would embarrass the family.</i>

40:30.562 --> 40:31.561

40:31.563 --> 40:34.063
She really does
sound awful.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.232
But don't you see?
We all have mommy issues.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.434
They say if a girl
doesn't have

40:37.436 --> 40:39.135
A healthy attachment
to their mother,

40:39.137 --> 40:41.104
They never
feel safe in the world.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.772
That's why I joined a sorority--

40:42.774 --> 40:44.908
To create a space
that could fill the void

40:44.910 --> 40:46.242
My mother carved out of me.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.211
I mean, kappa's like the mom
we never had.

40:48.213 --> 40:51.815
No, chanel. Kappa is like
the mom you<i> did</i> have.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.217
You're not healing anything
with the way you run kappa.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.419
You're just continuing
the same pattern.

40:56.421 --> 40:58.254
How are you any different
than your mom?

40:58.256 --> 40:59.823
I'm a work in progress, okay?

40:59.825 --> 41:02.425
Maybe I have to get
all this bitch out of me

41:02.427 --> 41:04.127
Before I can be the real me.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.729
I mean, maybe the reason
we came into each other's lives

41:06.731 --> 41:09.098
Is to help us deal
with our mom stuff.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.068
You by pretending to be nice
and innocent so I can see

41:12.070 --> 41:14.103
What of a bitch I am,
and me by telling you about

41:14.105 --> 41:16.773
Your real mom and how
heroically awful she was.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.107
I think you can admit
that you're better off

41:18.109 --> 41:19.609
Now that I told you.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.678
But your intention
wasn't to make my life better.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.146
It was to destroy me.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.949
(sighs)

41:25.951 --> 41:28.985
Look, I mean it.

41:28.987 --> 41:31.087
I'm sorry, okay?

41:40.999 --> 41:42.198
Thanks.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.002
I actually did
spit in that one.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.972
Sorry.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.607
(sighs)

41:53.144 --> 41:54.377
What?!

42:02.020 --> 42:04.020
Mind if I work in?

42:04.022 --> 42:05.955
Yeah, sure.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.524
You need a spot?

42:07.526 --> 42:08.725
If you don't mind.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.900
(grunts)

42:16.902 --> 42:18.134
Light weight.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.803
(grunting)

42:20.805 --> 42:24.040
I think that's joaquin phoenix.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.910
Strong, handsome.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.045
(phone vibrates)

42:30.048 --> 42:31.548
Hello?

42:31.550 --> 42:34.017
Look, I can't
live like this, okay?

42:34.019 --> 42:36.052
All I do is work out
and kill people.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.655
Where do you think I am?
I'm in the gym.

42:38.657 --> 42:39.989
Yeah, I'm wearing a disguise.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.591
What do you think,
I'm an idiot?

42:41.593 --> 42:43.026
Look, I'm totally incognito,

42:43.028 --> 42:44.561
I'm blending
right in.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.029
Look, gigi's the problem, okay?

42:46.031 --> 42:47.530
She's the one
that got us into this,

42:47.532 --> 42:49.165
And now she's blowing our brand.

42:49.167 --> 42:52.602
I mean, who shows up
in a justice scalia costume?

42:52.604 --> 42:55.371
Yeah. She said she got it
at the discount bin

42:55.373 --> 42:56.773
At the Halloween store.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.743
Hey, bro. You think I
could get your autograph?

43:00.745 --> 43:01.844
Sure.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.179
Listen, gigi's got to go. Okay?

43:03.181 --> 43:04.380
She's the weak link.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.849
We got to get rid of her now.
Thanks, bro.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.918
Hey, I loved you
in<i> gladiator,</i> man.
Yeah.

43:10.555 --> 43:13.222
Boone: We take her out, and then
we finish what we set out to do.
