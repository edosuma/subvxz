WEBVTT

00:09.542 --> 00:12.578
Ha-ha!
Good morning, stevens point!

00:12.580 --> 00:14.246
I'm your old pal
johnny nimbus,

00:14.248 --> 00:15.414
Coming at you live

00:15.416 --> 00:17.449
From the site of
the cheddar-brat fest,

00:17.451 --> 00:19.952
Where pride and pork
come together

00:19.954 --> 00:22.221
To celebrate
all things wisconsin.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.956
Cheddar-brat fest,
whoo!

00:23.958 --> 00:27.493
Oh, hey!
That is no ordinary
sausage enthusiast.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.528
That is the now-injured
captain

00:29.530 --> 00:30.829
Of the lady porcupines
basketball team,

00:30.831 --> 00:34.867
The brat fest being
moved to your school?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.736
Uh, well, johnny, I think
clancy's dairy farm was
a great place,

00:37.738 --> 00:39.405
But then that, um...

00:39.407 --> 00:40.739
Cow got struck
by lightening,

00:40.741 --> 00:44.243
Which was unfortunate.
( sharply inhales )

00:44.245 --> 00:46.945
- Smelled like steak, though.
- Mmm!

00:46.947 --> 00:49.214
Tragic, but delicious!
( laughs )

00:49.216 --> 00:50.849
Hey, and also with me

00:50.851 --> 00:52.684
Are the current
reigning cheese roll champs,

00:52.686 --> 00:54.253
Pete and karen rooney.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.924
Look at that.
Hey, pete, tell the folks
at home how you're feeling.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.895
Cheese.

01:03.763 --> 01:04.963
Fantastic!

01:04.965 --> 01:05.964
Hey, how about
we show everybody

01:05.966 --> 01:07.433
How this crazy
cheese roll thing

01:07.435 --> 01:09.268
Is gonna work
tomorrow, huh?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.403
Now the cheese roll
is all about teamwork.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.672
<i>Now the roller</i>
<i>can't see the target,</i>

01:13.674 --> 01:15.507
So they rely on
the spotter to
help them aim.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.276
Okay, turn a little
to the right.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.344
Down and roll.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.413
Karen:
<i>Yes!  Good job!</i>

01:21.415 --> 01:22.681
( laughs )

01:22.683 --> 01:24.283
Are you signing
for packages?

01:24.285 --> 01:25.684
Because we just
delivered the boom!

01:25.686 --> 01:27.519
( both laugh )

01:27.521 --> 01:29.988
Oh, that is why
they are four-time champs.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.857
Hey, little brat fest
fun fact:

01:31.859 --> 01:34.893
Nobody's ever won this
five years in a row.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.995
Liv:
<i>And no one ever will!</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:41.033
Cheddar-brat fest
is brat-solutely

01:41.035 --> 01:43.936
The thing that I miss most
about wisconsin when I was
off in hollywood.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.637
Maddie and I won
the cheese roll at age 12,

01:45.639 --> 01:47.706
And we got
these sweet jackets.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.911
It still fits.

01:52.913 --> 01:57.716
Liv has the freakish ability
to roll a wheel of cheese
with pinpoint accuracy.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.384
Takes after her father.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.786
( chuckling )
oh!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.087
Don't make me blush.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.355
( both chuckling )

02:03.357 --> 02:05.357
Ah, she was
"bull's-eye" rooney

02:05.359 --> 02:07.359
Long before she was
tristan lycanth

02:07.361 --> 02:08.494
Of the upcoming blockbuster

02:08.496 --> 02:11.296
"space werewolves."
ha-ha!

02:11.298 --> 02:13.966
I'm very excited, johnny.
The red carpet premiere
is next weekend.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.300
Oh, that's right.
And that's taking place

02:15.302 --> 02:16.969
Out there in  <i>hollywood.</i>

02:16.971 --> 02:18.036
Do you happen to have
an extra ticket?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.805
( laughs )

02:19.807 --> 02:20.939
Keep dreaming, johnny.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.508
I will!

02:22.510 --> 02:24.343
So, maddie,

02:24.345 --> 02:26.044
You sure about
this partner of yours?

02:26.046 --> 02:27.546
'cause she seems
to have the habit of

02:27.548 --> 02:33.485
I'm just saying.
Not trying to get into
your head or anything.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.921
<i>Not </i> going to work, mom.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.023
The cheese roll is
actually the first thing
liv and I ever won together,

02:38.025 --> 02:40.025
And, uh, now that she's home,

02:40.027 --> 02:42.995
The rooney twins are
rock-solid!

02:44.597 --> 02:46.498
We are rock-solid!
Right, liv?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.833
Absolutely, maddie.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.335
Now way I'm missing
the cheddar-brat fest this year.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.337
- I promise.
- Okay.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.673
Hey, mom and dad.
You feeling queasy?

02:54.675 --> 02:57.176
'cause it's about
to get cheesy.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.182
One time!

03:03.184 --> 03:04.983
Ooh-ooh!

03:59.405 --> 04:01.506
There it is, partner.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.208
The golden bratwurst trophy,

04:03.210 --> 04:06.979
Awarded to the winners of
the slippery sausage toss.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.981
Make no mistake.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.015
( whispers )
she will be mine.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.719
How can you tell when
a bratwurst is a lady?

04:13.721 --> 04:16.655
Ah, by the way
she's checking me out.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.023
Hey, girl.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.126
In the slippery
sausage toss,

04:21.128 --> 04:24.096
One teammate tosses
a greasy sausage to
the other one.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.098
If you drop one,
you're out.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.166
It's a metaphor for life.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.070
Wanna see my mad skills?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.072
Brat me, bro.
Bro, brat me.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.807
- All right.
- Right here, bro.
Right here.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.513
I got it.
I got it.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.814
No, don't got it.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.983
Big surprise.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.084
You're horrible at catching.

04:46.086 --> 04:49.621
You've seen me throw,
so that's out.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.957
Look, we have to win
that trophy.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.625
I must get to
my laboratory

04:53.627 --> 04:55.093
To build a device
that gives you

04:55.095 --> 04:56.995
The power to catch.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.563
That sounds good, partner.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.701
Ah, and, uh...

05:02.703 --> 05:04.136
You take care of
yourself, little mama.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.204
( mouths )

05:09.842 --> 05:11.977
Thanks, joey.
It's kind of hard
to carry my books

05:11.979 --> 05:14.179
- And work these things.
- Oh, no.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.015
Taking care of
the family is what I do.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.218
And now that the ladies
from sixth period have
seen me be a gentleman

05:20.220 --> 05:22.054
For my sister,
I'm done.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.190
Later, limpy.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.093
Thanks.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.130
( cellphone vibrates )

05:33.599 --> 05:35.934
- ( beeps )
- diggie, hey.
( giggles )

05:35.936 --> 05:40.005
-    <i>( wind whistling )</i>
<i>- ( stammering )</i>
<i>it's 40-below zero.</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:43.575
It's like the air is
trying to kill me.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.876
( exhales )

05:44.878 --> 05:46.011
When maddie was supposed
to leave

05:46.013 --> 05:47.779
For the junior olympics
basketball team,

05:47.781 --> 05:50.115
I decided I didn't wanna
be home when she wasn't.

05:50.117 --> 05:53.085
So I signed up to be
a foreign exchange student.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.121
Which is like way romantic,
except then, you know,

05:56.123 --> 05:58.890
I blew my knee out,
so I couldn't go.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.093
So now I have a boyfriend
who's 6,000 miles away.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.160
( chuckles )

06:02.162 --> 06:04.029
What a jerk.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.997
Guess what happens
when you're the last

06:05.999 --> 06:08.133
Foreign exchange student
to sign up.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.602
You get the country
that nobody wants--

06:10.604 --> 06:12.137
Tundrabania.

06:12.139 --> 06:18.009
That's where tundrabanian kids
go on spring break to warm up.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.812
I really wish you were gonna be
here for cheddar-brat fest.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.281
I do too.
It's so cold.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.283
Say things that are warm.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.720
Aw, is that diggie?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.155
Mrs. Rooney, hey!

06:30.157 --> 06:31.656
I heard you got promoted
to vice-principal.

06:31.658 --> 06:32.791
Congratulations.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.327
Thanks.
It's a big job.

06:35.329 --> 06:37.929
Yeah, she's in charge
of things like, you know,

06:37.931 --> 06:39.064
Enforcing the rules--

06:39.066 --> 06:41.099
For example,
no facegabbing
in the halls.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.734
- Oh!
- Confiscated.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.637
Mom!

06:45.639 --> 06:48.640
Okay, I know that
you're trying to
rattle me,

06:48.642 --> 06:51.977
But me and liv are
gonna take you down
at the cheese roll.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.980
- Bam!  What?!
- ( chuckles )

06:54.982 --> 06:57.115
Maybe I am.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.784
Why don't you go
cry to your boyfriend

06:58.786 --> 07:00.018
In tundrabania about it?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.154
Oh, wait, you can't.
I got your phone.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.891
Heh.
Would you mind

07:05.893 --> 07:07.292
Helping me
carry my books?

07:07.294 --> 07:10.128
Hello?
Okay...

07:10.130 --> 07:11.663
( bones crack )
I got this.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.069
Mama's here!
Mama's here!

07:20.373 --> 07:22.073
Ahem.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.175
This changes nothing.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.022
Are you making
your own sausage?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.890
Cool.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.026
Oh, it's not just
any sausage, all right?

07:41.028 --> 07:43.862
I'm putting pieces
of metal into the links.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.764
Wanna know why?

07:45.766 --> 07:51.670
Sometimes you get a feeling
that something special's
about to happen.

07:51.672 --> 07:56.141
I figured out how to win
the slippery sausage toss.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.310
"brat bros."

07:58.312 --> 08:00.979
Nice!

08:00.981 --> 08:02.981
Joey plus bling equals...

08:02.983 --> 08:04.816
( high-pitched )
holla!

08:04.818 --> 08:05.951
Think fast.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.420
( metal clanks )

08:09.655 --> 08:11.256
I caught it!

08:11.258 --> 08:13.024
Witchcraft.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.861
The rings are magnets.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.429
The metal sausage will
stick right to them.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.197
It's doof-proof.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.000
Isn't this cheating?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.735
Hey, the rulebook
doesn't say you can't

08:23.737 --> 08:26.805
Stuff the sausage with metal
and wear electro-magnetic rings.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.674
I'm sold.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.877
Any chances of matching
necklace and chalice?

08:31.879 --> 08:33.178
Ah, sorry.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.247
Some things I just like
to keep for myself.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.187
Today is
the cheddar-brat fest.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.889
I finally get to do
the cheese roll

08:43.891 --> 08:46.691
I was actually so excited
that I went to bed

08:46.693 --> 08:48.393
In my champion jacket
last night.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.031
Parker, come on!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.333
You're gonna be late
for cheddar-brat fest!

08:55.335 --> 08:57.235
( whispers )
you too, liv and maddie.

08:58.938 --> 09:02.173
Hate for you to miss
the ride and have to
forfeit the cheese roll.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.042
( normal voice )
start the car.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.077
Ah, nice try, mom.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.079
Maddie, come on!

09:08.081 --> 09:10.081
Oh, look.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.417
Somebody hung
my "space werewolves" poster.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.485
Looks perfect.

09:14.854 --> 09:16.855
It's about time
someone recognized

09:16.857 --> 09:18.857
My superior
hanging abilities.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.892
- Oh, careful.
- No no.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.160
- Liv.
-  <i>Yeah.</i>

09:22.162 --> 09:24.129
I am so proud of you.

09:24.131 --> 09:27.799
Next weekend, my little
space werewolf is gonna
be walking the red carpet

09:27.801 --> 09:29.768
At her movie premiere!

09:29.770 --> 09:32.003
Oh, thanks, dad.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.138
Aww.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.372
( chuckles )

09:34.374 --> 09:36.875
Using affection to
neutralize competitive fire--

09:36.877 --> 09:38.510
Fierce power move.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.948
Not primetime's
first rodeo.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.083
Ah, o-m-wowza!

09:45.085 --> 09:46.351
How great is this?

09:46.353 --> 09:48.353
Nothing can stop
my triumphant return

09:48.355 --> 09:49.354
To the cheddar-brat fest.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.089
Yes.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.191
Major "space werewolves"
problems!

09:53.193 --> 09:55.827
Ohh.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.163
Whitney, what are you
doing in stevens point?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.331
You're the producer.
You're supposed to
be in hollywood

09:59.333 --> 10:00.799
Getting ready
for the premiere.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.300
Well, I hopped on
the studio's private jet,

10:02.302 --> 10:04.169
And came straight here to
give you some horrible news.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.972
"lunar foxes" changed
their premiere

10:06.974 --> 10:08.273
To the same day
as ours!

10:08.275 --> 10:09.407
( gasps )
no!

10:09.409 --> 10:11.343
Those dirty lunar foxes.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.313
So the buzz on
"space werewolves" is so huge

10:15.315 --> 10:17.782
That a rival studio made
a copycat film

10:17.784 --> 10:19.551
Called "lunar foxes."

10:19.553 --> 10:21.553
( scoffs )
pathetic.

10:21.555 --> 10:23.021
It's like putting ketchup
on a bagel

10:23.023 --> 10:24.823
And calling it pizza.
Ugh.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.858
They're trying
to steal our audience.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.361
Not only is their premiere
the same day as ours,

10:29.363 --> 10:31.496
But they're going to
project their movie...

10:31.498 --> 10:34.032
Onto the face of the moon.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.333
We can't compete
with the moon!

10:35.335 --> 10:37.035
Oh, yes, we can!

10:37.037 --> 10:39.471
I changed our premiere
to tonight!

10:39.473 --> 10:41.906
The whit don't quit.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.542
We gotta get you packed.
We're going to hollywood
right now.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.144
Uh, now?
No.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.312
Oh?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.047
I'll miss
the cheddar-brat fest.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.516
I promised my sister
that I would be there
for the cheese roll.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.518
Oh, liv.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.187
You are the star
of "space werewolves."

10:56.189 --> 10:58.957
<i>We need you</i>
<i>at the premiere, so...</i>

10:58.959 --> 11:00.392
Unless this cheese
you're gonna roll

11:00.394 --> 11:02.460
Cost 100 million dollars
to make,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.129
You're getting on
that plane.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.566
Fine.
I guess I'm going.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.435
Wait, you're not going
to the cheddar-brat fest?

11:12.338 --> 11:14.005
But you promised me.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.509
I guess it must mean
something different in hollywood

11:17.511 --> 11:19.244
Than it does in wisconsin.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.419
Guess that only thing liv's
gonna crush in that cheese roll

11:27.421 --> 11:28.586
Is maddie's heart.

11:30.089 --> 11:31.856
Too soon?
Yeah, it's too soon.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.599
<i>( oompah music paying )</i>

11:41.601 --> 11:43.368
Ha-ha!  Look at that!

11:43.370 --> 11:47.105
Amazing!
Let's hear it for
engelbert lungburger.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.108
The pretzel king,
everybody!  Huh?!

11:50.110 --> 11:52.210
Hey, maddie.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.579
I'm sorry liv's not here.
You doing okay?

11:54.581 --> 11:56.247
Yeah.
I'm fine.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.349
I mean, you know,
liv's doing her thing

11:58.351 --> 11:59.384
And I'm doing mine,
so--

11:59.386 --> 12:02.287
Besides...

12:02.289 --> 12:04.222
I'm gonna take you down
myself.

12:05.991 --> 12:07.192
Ahem.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.630
Okay.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.967
Oh.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.539
Don't look at me.

12:28.114 --> 12:31.182
Okay, let's go.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.650
You should be in hollywood.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.186
- Stop!  I should be here, okay?
- Oh!

12:35.188 --> 12:36.988
Oh, no,
there's no stopping.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.623
We need time to style you
for that premiere.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.525
Oh.
What are you doing?

12:40.527 --> 12:42.093
Plane's a-waitin'.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.695
Wow, you are really strong.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.397
Whitney, I can't just
leave my sister

12:46.399 --> 12:47.532
Hanging like this,
okay?

12:47.534 --> 12:48.666
I made her a promise.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.668
Did you make that promise
with your abs?

12:50.670 --> 12:52.103
Wow!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.304
Oh, come on.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.240
- Okay!
- Oh, my god.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.444
Whitney, if you make me go
to that premiere tonight,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.179
All that those photographers
are gonna see

13:01.181 --> 13:02.180
On the red carpet is this.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.082
Boom boom boom--

13:04.084 --> 13:05.216
Sad face.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.051
No no no.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.686
No sad face on
the red carpet.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.688
Whitney, come on!
There has to be some way

13:10.690 --> 13:13.124
To get me to go to both
the cheddar-brat fest
and my premiere.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.193
It's just not possible.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.294
( whimpers )

13:18.531 --> 13:22.200
Well...

13:22.202 --> 13:24.335
Well, technically,
it might be kinda
possible.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.237
( gasps )

13:26.239 --> 13:28.206
If we delay the private jet
two hours and do your hair
and makeup here.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.074
- ( groans loudly )
- ( squeals )

13:30.076 --> 13:31.509
Then I can still do
the cheese roll with my sister

13:31.511 --> 13:33.545
And be in hollywood on time
for the premiere. ( gasps )

13:33.547 --> 13:35.213
Hold on.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.581
Bam!

13:36.583 --> 13:39.250

time with her family

13:39.252 --> 13:41.486
Before big hollywood premiere.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
That is a story with heart!

13:43.323 --> 13:44.689
You can't project that
onto the moon.

13:44.691 --> 13:46.324
- Let's do it.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.126
Boom boom boom--

<i>A brat-topus, if you will.</i>

Oh, we're down to two teams.
Only two teams left.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.117
I know his sister is
in the movies,

14:13.119 --> 14:15.320
But joey rooney's
the real star today!

14:16.488 --> 14:18.189
<i>Unbelievable!</i>
<i>This is just</i>

14:29.035 --> 14:31.269
Unbelievable stuff.
What's your secret, boys?

14:31.271 --> 14:34.105
- Science!
- Hard work.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.340
Hard work.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.209
Okay, enough primping.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.510
The cheese roll's
about to start.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.212
Livie, let them work
their magic.

photographed more tonight

oh.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.486
Hey!  Hi.

15:21.488 --> 15:24.155
So, um, my hair

15:24.157 --> 15:25.823
Kind of got sucked
into a...

15:25.825 --> 15:26.824
Oh!

15:26.826 --> 15:28.092
...A meat grinder.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.664
But, uh, you know,
on the bright side...

15:32.666 --> 15:34.232
- Help me!
- Aah!

15:34.234 --> 15:36.234
Help me, whitney, help me.
I don't know what to do!

15:36.236 --> 15:37.769
Okay.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.374
And to the slippery sausage
toss champions

15:43.376 --> 15:46.144
Goes the golden bratwurst!

15:46.146 --> 15:47.879
Congratulations, boys.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.214
Seriously, joey rooney,
how did you do it?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.382
Oh, well, johnny,

15:51.384 --> 15:54.252
Johnny johnny, success is
50% preparation

15:54.254 --> 15:56.487
And 50% perspiration.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.189
But me?  No no no.

I mean, think fast.
Huh?

Second time's the charm.
There you go.

throwing one from this bin?

joey's rings are magnets!

16:30.156 --> 16:32.256

16:32.258 --> 16:35.560
How could you do this
to the cheddar-brat fest?

16:35.562 --> 16:38.930
I thought we raised you
to respect sausage.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.201
Okay, I got a guy coming.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.270
He's gonna get your hair out
so we can salvage it for
the premiere.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.438
Can he do it
in the next five minutes

16:47.440 --> 16:48.840
So that I can make
the cheese roll?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.775

two hours to fix your hair.

the festival.

Okay.
Maddie needs you.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.978

17:26.980 --> 17:28.546
You can do this.

Oh, why couldn't have been
my arm that got stuck?!

17:37.357 --> 17:39.424
Okay.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.997
Say it isn't so!
This just in:

Maddie rooney has
backed out of the cheese roll.

17:49.235 --> 17:52.303
- ( all gasp )
- that means pete and karen
rooney are winners by default.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.806
Huh?!  Let's hear it
for 'em, folks.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.707
You ready for that crown,
pete?

17:58.577 --> 18:00.711
Cheese.

<i>You're gonna have to</i>
<i>earn that crown!</i>

Liv?

Holy hacked up
hunks of hair!

Ooh, ah...

Ooh.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.957
What happened?

18:12.959 --> 18:16.928

your hair for me?

18:25.839 --> 18:27.305
What about your premiere?

18:27.307 --> 18:29.040
Um, actually,
whitney says that

18:29.042 --> 18:30.875
If I can win this
within the next 10 minutes,

18:30.877 --> 18:31.909
I could still make
the premiere.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.578
Nine minutes,
38 seconds.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.646

- Okay, maddie.

Okay, seriously,

19:32.939 --> 19:34.772
Oh, sorry.
That's right.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.908
You never changed
our diapers.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.577
I was too worried
I would get clumsy
and drop you.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.045
Wow.
( inhales sharply )

19:41.047 --> 19:42.813
Really hope you don't drop
this wheel of cheese.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.615
You know it weighs about
as much as a...

19:44.617 --> 19:46.083
Baby girl.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.352
( mimics baby crying )

19:50.856 --> 19:54.058
( gasps )
did she get in your head?

19:54.060 --> 19:55.960
Shake it off,
primetime.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.496
- You're the champ.
- Nimbus:  <i>This is for</i>
<i>all the marbles.</i>

19:58.498 --> 20:00.932
And here he goes.
He lets it roll, and...

20:00.934 --> 20:03.401
Jimmy jumped up,
mother of may!

20:03.403 --> 20:04.468
Nimbus:
<i>Whoo!</i>

20:05.737 --> 20:08.039
If the twins can knock down
their pretzel castle,

20:08.041 --> 20:09.040
They win!

20:09.042 --> 20:10.875
She intimidated
my partner.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.043
You go get her,
pretzel king.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.745
There is no smack talk
in the cheese roll.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.814
You are banned from
aiming your partner.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.583
What?  No!

20:18.585 --> 20:20.518
How can I hit the castle
without my aimer?

20:20.520 --> 20:21.686
You know what, liv?
It's fine.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.589
Because if anyone
can find a castle,

20:24.591 --> 20:25.656
It's a princess.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.725
Of course.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.094
Activate
<i>diva sonar.</i>

20:31.663 --> 20:33.731
( vocalizing )

20:37.402 --> 20:39.136
Got it.
Target locked.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.439
<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

20:47.179 --> 20:48.946
( all cheering )

20:52.150 --> 20:53.884
Ah ah ah.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.886
Still hideous under here.
Thank you.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.623
There's a new cheese sheriff
in town,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.057
And her name is
"bull's-eye" rooney!

21:00.059 --> 21:02.927
All right!
We gotta go.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.063
Let's get on the plane,
rooneys!

21:06.065 --> 21:10.801
You think I'm going to
my big hollywood premiere
without my family?

21:11.937 --> 21:14.605
( laughs )
move move move!

21:14.607 --> 21:16.907
Let's do it.
Hit it, yes!

21:16.909 --> 21:19.944
I love you, wisconsin!

21:19.946 --> 21:21.946
That was exciting, huh?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.981
Oh, boy.
For the record,

21:23.983 --> 21:25.783
I didn't even wanna go
to liv rooney's

21:25.785 --> 21:27.718
Stupid hollywood premiere,
you know?

21:27.720 --> 21:28.919
- My job's right here...
- Hey, johnny?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.554
- ...In steven's point.
- Um.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.757
We have an extra seat
on the plane, so it's, uh,

21:32.759 --> 21:33.824
Yours if you want it.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.228
Johnny nimbus is going
to hollywood.

21:37.230 --> 21:41.198
- ( microphone feedback )
- wait up!

21:43.035 --> 21:45.102
( overlapping chatter )

21:54.212 --> 21:55.579
( both giggle )

21:55.581 --> 21:57.014
I'm really glad
wisconsin liv is back,

21:57.016 --> 21:59.684
But hollywood liv has
some serious perks.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.186
( laughs, snorts )

22:02.188 --> 22:03.688
Let's keep her around.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.789
( laughs )

22:04.791 --> 22:06.023
Hey, guys.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.959
- Yeah, check me out.
- ( indistinct chatter )

22:08.961 --> 22:11.796
- How do I look?
- Everyone say...

22:11.798 --> 22:15.199
- All: Cheese!
