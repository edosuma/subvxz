WEBVTT

00:00.709 --> 00:02.669
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:02.669 --> 00:04.337
<i>I'm not Axe. I'm different.</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:05.964
<i>And I'm willing
to put the time</i>

00:05.964 --> 00:07.465
<i>and effort in
to prove that to you.</i>

00:07.465 --> 00:09.009
With Axe,
I didn't have to pretend

00:09.009 --> 00:10.927
I was making glittery cupcakes

00:10.927 --> 00:13.179
while shivving a motherfucker
who needed shivving.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.974
Maybe Prince's
way is more powerful.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.684
Welcome to
Michael Prince Capital, Kate.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.144
Where do I work?

00:19.144 --> 00:20.895
There comes a time, Lucien,

00:20.895 --> 00:22.647
when ideology meets reality.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.399
Even in the newspaper business.

00:24.399 --> 00:28.153
I want your comment on the
story I am running.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.030
We both share the same vision

00:30.030 --> 00:33.533
of what a Summer Games
in New York should look like.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.368
I thrive in peacetime.

00:35.368 --> 00:39.706
But the best way to peace
is through overwhelming force.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.374
<i>The 2028 Games</i>

00:41.374 --> 00:43.710
<i>can no longer be held
in New York City.</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:45.045
Chuck can be removed as AG.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.421
How do we pull the lever?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.881
Charles Rhoades Junior

00:47.881 --> 00:49.257
is hereby removed
as attorney general

00:49.257 --> 00:50.592
of the State of New York.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.469
The Senate names
Miss Daevisha Mahar

00:52.469 --> 00:54.262
as acting attorney general

00:54.262 --> 00:56.306
for the remainder
of Mr. Rhoades' term.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.892
You want to know why Axe
is satisfied with freedom?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.810
Why Chuck is priapic
for warfare?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.729
Because they are lesser Caesars.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.898
You want to be a greater
Caesar?

01:04.898 --> 01:08.068
Michael fucking Prince
is running for president.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.737
President of
the United States of America.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.822
- And one of us...
- Both of us.

01:12.822 --> 01:15.408
...could be running Michael
Prince Capital very soon.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.410
<i>For you to succeed
at being whatever it is</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.079
<i>you want to be, you need
to stop lying to yourself.</i>

01:19.079 --> 01:21.414
<i>Let's not forget about you</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:23.249
<i>and what you want
out of all of this.</i>

01:23.249 --> 01:25.251
<i>Prince is funding
Mike Money with crypto.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.712
<i>Ten incorrect attempts
and it'll encrypt itself,</i>

01:27.712 --> 01:29.589
<i>making it impossible
to access whatever's on it.</i>

01:29.589 --> 01:32.926
If we go down this road, one of
you is ending up in jail.

01:34.969 --> 01:39.099
<i>This night's cost me
$3.5 billion already.</i>

01:39.099 --> 01:41.392
<i>We're gonna destroy
Mike Prince together.</i>

01:41.392 --> 01:43.144
<i>The world will think
you're under indictment,</i>

01:43.144 --> 01:46.606
right up until the minute
we lock Mike Prince up.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.774
You got a deal.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.009
Find me Wendy fucking Rhoades.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
She's actually here?!

02:34.320 --> 02:36.656
What is so fucking
wrong about me

02:36.656 --> 02:40.076
that you're sure I shouldn't
be fucking president?

02:51.754 --> 02:53.381
<i>Uh-huh</i>

02:55.425 --> 02:58.720
<i>I've got the new style
Uh-oh</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:02.140
<i>And I'm walking
Right down your street</i>

03:02.140 --> 03:05.852
<i>I'm on your speed dial
You know</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:09.814
<i>The one everyone
Wants to meet</i>

03:09.814 --> 03:14.319
<i>I always tell you
How cool you dress</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:16.946
<i>It's 'cause
I'm fashionably socialized</i>

03:16.946 --> 03:21.034
<i>You're smarter, better
No, the best</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:22.952
<i>Just look at me</i>

03:22.952 --> 03:26.164
<i>I'm a leader, I'm a winner</i>

03:26.164 --> 03:28.208
<i>And I'm cleaner</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:29.500
<i>'Cause I'm awesome</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:30.793
<i>I don't need you</i>

03:30.793 --> 03:32.712
<i>'Cause I'm neato</i>

03:32.712 --> 03:35.089
<i>And I beat you
'Cause I'm awesome</i>

03:35.089 --> 03:37.008
<i>- I'm a leader
- I'm a leader</i>

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
<i>- I'm a winner
- I'm a winner</i>

03:39.427 --> 03:41.596
<i>- And I'm cleaner
- And I'm cleaner</i>

03:41.763 --> 03:43.890
<i>- 'Cause I'm awesome
- 'Cause I'm awesome</i>

03:44.015 --> 03:46.309
<i>- I don't need you
- I don't need you</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:47.894
<i>- 'Cause I'm neato
- 'Cause I'm neato</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:50.146
<i>- And I beat you
- And I beat you</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:52.232
<i>- 'Cause I'm awesome
- That's right</i>

03:52.357 --> 03:53.983
<i>Rah, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah, rah</i>

03:54.275 --> 03:55.985
<i>- I'm awesome
- Rah, rah, rah, rah</i>

03:56.236 --> 03:57.946
<i>- Rah, rah, rah
- That's right</i>

03:57.946 --> 04:00.907
<i>Rah, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah, rah</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:03.826
<i>I don't need you
'Cause I'm awesome</i>

04:03.826 --> 04:05.203
<i>Uh-huh</i>

04:17.924 --> 04:19.676
This is part two, Wendy.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.719
Just you and me.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.763
Part one was the day
you grilled me

04:23.763 --> 04:25.390
right here all alone.
This is--

04:25.390 --> 04:28.101
Part two, yeah.
You said.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.852
I need to go deep.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.271
We do.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.357
That's my specialty.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.068
But now you need
to do it for me.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.195
I've been doing
a kind of internal

04:39.195 --> 04:41.447
chiropractic adjustment,

04:41.447 --> 04:43.574
trying to align myself
to find the parts in there

04:43.574 --> 04:45.618
that are fighting
the whole, but--

04:45.618 --> 04:48.496
Yeah, you can't do that alone.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.456
But you could have just
walked through that door

04:50.456 --> 04:52.000
and asked me to dive in.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.793
Instead, you cleared
the office. Why?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.795
Well, I can't just let anyone,
not even you,

04:55.795 --> 04:57.463
all the way inside
without being sure.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.425
So you plan on interrogating me
the way I did you?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.511
I pass.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.388
Don't think of it like that.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.473
Where I'm going,
I need loyalists.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.518
Not blind loyalists,
open-eyed believers.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.520
Like Nirvana fans
back in the day.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.064
No. Most of them
didn't understand Kurt.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.317
I need to know that you get me.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.277
You want me to be
your Courtney Love?

05:19.277 --> 05:20.820
No. My Dave Grohl.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.656
Lay down a monster beat
and keep me on it.

05:23.656 --> 05:26.242
Well, I could say
I wouldn't be standing here

05:26.242 --> 05:28.286
if I weren't prepared to.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.163
Uh, I'm not sure
that's good enough.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.542
We need to get
to your why.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.171
Here's a why.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.675
Why are you so confident
I'll play along?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.969
Why don't you think
I'll just turn around,

05:44.969 --> 05:46.471
pack out my desk and leave?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.181
Because I didn't
sign up for this.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.016
Not many people would walk away

05:50.016 --> 05:51.184
from the kind of access
and power you'd have

05:51.184 --> 05:52.477
if you hang in close.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.395
You talking about
your run for office?

05:57.106 --> 05:59.859
Twenty-eight is a long way off.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.072
Oh.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.823
Timeline's shifted.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.868
I'm going to do things
differently, yes.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.079
I'm announcing
on my own timeline.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.372
I'm going to run and win in--

06:12.372 --> 06:15.166
- 2024.
- I need it now.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.417
Before it's too late.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.753
Assuming I'll win,
I'll need to know

06:18.753 --> 06:22.382
that I'm not just ready
for this job, but primed.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.176
I have blind spots.
Everyone does.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.553
But I need to know that
you're in to expose them to me

06:27.553 --> 06:29.055
so that I can see and fix them.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.890
Fair enough.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.855
But I'm-I'm still not sure what
it is you need to hear from me.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.400
Well, start by finishing
this sentence.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
"Michael Prince is..."

06:44.529 --> 06:48.241
Michael Prince is
going about this all wrong.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.201
Because instead
of trying to extract

06:50.201 --> 06:52.245
a loyalty test from me,

06:52.245 --> 06:55.581
what he should be doing is
using every second of his life

06:55.581 --> 06:57.834
trying to convince me
and everyone like me

06:57.834 --> 07:00.253
that he's worthy
of my investment.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.756
Look inward for sure.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.384
But look outward
to engage all those

07:06.384 --> 07:07.760
you're gonna need
to get you there.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.262
Just tell me this.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.930
Are you still capable
of getting it done?

07:10.930 --> 07:13.933
That is not what
you really want to know.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.228
What is it you really
want to know?

07:19.105 --> 07:21.315
Why is it so hard
for you to do it for me

07:21.315 --> 07:23.109
when it was so easy for you
with Axe?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.779
No one would use
the word "easy."

07:28.114 --> 07:30.158
But he was direct.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.077
He wanted the things
he wanted.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.121
And once we cleared out
the inner conflicts,

07:35.121 --> 07:36.914
he just went after them
and got them.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.626
So you turned him
into a targeted missile.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.629
Oh, I just tweaked
the guidance system a little.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.466
He was already a missile.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.218
You can't help but smile
as you talk about him.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.388
What is it that makes you smile

07:52.388 --> 07:53.806
when you think about
where you want to go?

07:55.766 --> 07:57.560
We're starting.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.978
We are.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.443
So?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.361
Why are you the one
right now, this second,

08:07.361 --> 08:09.197
to do this?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.824
Not the stem-winder
you'll give on the hustings,

08:11.824 --> 08:13.075
but the real answer
you give yourself

08:13.075 --> 08:14.827
in the mirror at 2:00 a.m.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.209
Because of my ruthlessness.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.216
Say more.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.305
Think of it this way.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.140
If you're out on a climb

08:36.140 --> 08:38.142
and you fall
and break your femur in half,

08:38.142 --> 08:40.144
you don't need someone who
knows how to talk a good game.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.104
You need someone who knows
how to fix it.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.649
Someone who's willing to do
what needs to be done,

08:44.649 --> 08:47.777
even when there's no anesthesia
out on the trail.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.446
Someone who will ignore
your screams of pain

08:50.446 --> 08:52.865
until the bone is set
and ready to heal.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.534
That someone is me.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.210
And our country is the femur.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.712
Damn right it is.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.049
Strength.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.009
People want that when
they believe it's not put on,

09:12.009 --> 09:13.344
but real.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.764
People?

09:16.764 --> 09:19.100
Where it went wrong
was when politicians

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
thought they had to listen
to people.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.436
Not smart people.
Not educated people.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.188
Just people.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.439
There is such a thing
as worthy dissent.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.899
The First Amendment.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.859
The Founders never wanted
a true democracy,

09:28.859 --> 09:31.904
but a constitutional republic.
You know this.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.369
So when you get there
to the Oval Office...

09:38.369 --> 09:40.037
Truman had a sign on his desk
that said,

09:40.037 --> 09:41.914
"The buck stops here."

09:41.914 --> 09:44.959
Mine's gonna say,
"I am the buck."

09:59.223 --> 10:00.850
Let's fucking get you there.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.395
That's my girl.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.564
Uh, doctor. Uh...

10:06.564 --> 10:07.940
Yeah, you're on
a different stage now,

10:07.940 --> 10:09.442
so don't do that.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.110
Copy.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.449
So you didn't clear
the whole day.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.451
Oh, I knew
you wouldn't need it.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
And I have someplace
I very much need to be.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.478
Wags, when was the last time
you had egg foo young?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.897
Old-school style
with the pork just so?

10:47.897 --> 10:51.067
Because whenever that was,
the next time is tonight.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.160
My client
has no prior felonies,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.828
no pending criminal matters.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.330
He's already surrendered
his passport.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.625
Mr. Rhoades is a man
of some renown,

11:07.625 --> 11:09.669
which makes flight
even more unlikely.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.505
The GPS ankle monitor, Judge,
is an unnecessary

11:12.505 --> 11:14.090
and extraordinary measure.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.259
Well, Chuck and I go way back.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.513
And I know him to be
an extraordinary character.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.223
Thank you?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.183
Uh, Judge Wailand,

11:24.183 --> 11:25.685
I'd call you
by your first name,

11:25.893 --> 11:27.478
but we don't want that
kind of thing on the record.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.147
You're treating me
like some kind of lamster.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.816
But fleeing jurisdiction
is the move

11:31.816 --> 11:33.526
the guys I chase
like to make.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.361
Please don't
address the bench directly

11:35.361 --> 11:37.655
unless the bench
addresses you...

11:39.073 --> 11:40.866
as I'm about to do.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.911
But how, exactly,

11:43.911 --> 11:46.706
is this device
causing you undue trouble?

11:46.706 --> 11:51.669
You'd be still expected to
continue your supervised release

11:51.669 --> 11:54.588
and check-ins for pre-trial
services regardless.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.717
But this thing on my leg,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.886
what the kids call
a Coney Island Crunk-o-Meter,

12:00.886 --> 12:02.430
is chafing me.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.640
I am chafing.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.726
Emotionally and physically.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.811
<i>Literally and figuratively,</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:10.855
<i>if the distinction
even exists anymore,</i>

12:10.855 --> 12:13.816
<i>and I haven't been
convicted of a damn thing.</i>

12:13.816 --> 12:16.235
<i>I can't see how your itchiness</i>

12:16.235 --> 12:18.821
<i>is something this court
should be worried about.</i>

12:19.321 --> 12:21.741
This is all going
the way it's supposed to.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.242
Yeah. Good. I see.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.744
But you called this meeting.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.204
Because, while I'd like to
think what I have is enough,

12:27.204 --> 12:28.873
this is Chuck
we're dealing with.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.040
You don't think you have
enough?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.625
Could always use more.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.753
I want to bring the garlic,
the crucifix,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.463
the stake through the heart.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.757
Well, there's plenty out there.
The guy's pathological.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.592
He has history
with Taylor Mason,

12:39.592 --> 12:41.761
Wendy, obviously, and others
that used to work there.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.471
- And that's my company alone.
- Sure.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.431
Love to talk to them,
with your permission.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.267
Kate Sacker, too,
if she's allowed.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.810
They might not
be comfortable with it,

12:49.810 --> 12:51.395
but I'll let them know I am

12:51.395 --> 12:52.938
for the purposes
of winning this.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.774
But once I open the door,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.275
it's up to you
to get them talking.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.279
To that end,
shouldn't you be there

13:00.279 --> 13:01.947
to make sure
he doesn't win this thing?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.867
I know how this is going to go.
Request denied.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.913
<i>Request denied.</i>

13:10.289 --> 13:12.541
Let me know
when that door is open.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.474
This is how you and Dave
drew it up, right?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.809
Certain aspects of it, yeah.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.144
This is the hard stretch.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.647
This kind of reversal
lends credibility.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.565
In a way, it's the best thing
that could've happened.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.693
So you say, partner.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.204
What you got
to understand is this.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.206
This is good news.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.166
This is the good news express
right here. Climb aboard.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.751
This is not
what good news looks like.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.920
No. Good news at this place
comes via text or email,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.129
or is delivered
by one of these men.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.589
When it's the two of them

14:00.589 --> 14:01.924
coming in hot
like <i>Turner and Hooch...</i>

14:01.924 --> 14:03.425
Who's the dog in that?

14:03.425 --> 14:05.302
- Whatever they're selling--
- Yes.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.179
Yeah, who's the dog?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.430
Whatever you're selling,
we're all full up.

14:08.430 --> 14:09.682
We don't want any.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.600
First of all,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.269
and before we go any further, congratulations.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.312
You got into the ESG space
right on time.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.773
Early, even,
and have done very nicely.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.942
More than nicely.
You've kicked royal ass.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.444
You're giving heavy dad-rock
right now.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.947
Well, but it's true.
So Michael Prince believes--

14:24.947 --> 14:26.782
- He knows--
- Yes.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.702
He has decided that early-in
leads to early-out.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.204
So that the two of you
can focus fully on this place.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.957
This entire place.
See? This is good news.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.709
This is growing up.
This is the major leagues.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.210
- This is--
- You killing my business.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.837
- Our.
- Absolutely. Our business.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.839
My brand.
Environmental, social

14:41.839 --> 14:43.549
and governance-centered
investing is--

14:43.549 --> 14:45.843
Is oversaturated
and picked over.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.762
Plus, if Prince has a carve-out
that specializes in ESG,

14:48.762 --> 14:50.681
it means the main firm
disregards ESG.

14:50.681 --> 14:52.725
- You see?
- I do.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.727
The key at this place is,
it's one brand now

14:54.727 --> 14:56.395
that the two of you
are running.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.188
Don't think of it
as killing what you had.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.691
No one is killing anything.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.818
Taylor Mason Carbon
will be sunsetted,

15:02.818 --> 15:06.447
but you will be right here at
the head of one unified firm.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.948
These offices will be upgraded

15:07.948 --> 15:09.366
and turned into
your command center.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.951
We don't have a voice in this?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.536
Of course you do,

15:12.536 --> 15:14.413
and that voice
is going to be heard.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.249
And then it is
going to say, "Yes!"

15:17.791 --> 15:20.169
- I don't like it.
- Taylor doesn't like it.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.338
And neither do I.
We have to--

15:22.338 --> 15:24.548
total and complete respect
to the two of you, of course--

15:24.548 --> 15:26.759
but we have to take this
directly to Prince.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.928
Don't think of this
as us going over your heads.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.512
Just know we are going
over your heads.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.680
And the dog--

15:31.680 --> 15:33.349
whichever one of you

15:33.349 --> 15:34.558
happens to be barking loudest
at the moment--

15:34.558 --> 15:36.101
you're Hooch.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.943
You wearing
your invisibility cloak?

15:43.943 --> 15:45.527
It's at the cleaners.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.904
Well, I must
be wearing mine,

15:46.904 --> 15:48.072
'cause Prince can't see me.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.825
There it is.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.373
Oh, come on!

15:57.373 --> 16:00.292
He isn't free. Isn't going
to be, for you, all day.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.174
I have the plan.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.592
And the authority
to hear you out.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.718
Good, we can go
to your office and--

16:09.718 --> 16:11.303
I'm in with him right now.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.305
Later. Maybe tomorrow.
I'll find you.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.165
Hey, Kev, move around.
Let me face the room.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.792
No, Pop, I'm good.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.670
If the seat
doesn't suit you, son,

16:44.670 --> 16:46.255
we can retire to my place.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.673
I'll have them
send the food over.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.508
Oh, yeah, we have plenty
in the freezer.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.886
Could reheat last night's
dinner from Le Bernardin.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.180
We have a Gaja
just coming into its own.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.849
Yeah, let's go eat at
Grandpa's.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.226
No. Nonsense.
We will eat right here.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.602
And if it's a chewy Gaja
you want,

17:00.602 --> 17:02.229
let's get that going
right now.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.189
Just go ahead
and take the seat, Chuck.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.442
You know, I'm surprised
you came, Wend.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.902
A pleasant surprise,
but a surprise nonetheless.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.696
I have a work dinner after this,

17:10.696 --> 17:12.656
so I just kind of stopped by
to, you know, be here

17:12.656 --> 17:15.075
for the kids,
say hi to your dad.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.744
Be here for the...

17:19.413 --> 17:21.498
Oh, oh, oh.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.333
It makes sense.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.045
Ah, the super-early bird dinner.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.005
Me facing the wall,

17:28.005 --> 17:30.299
you here as a buffer of sorts
against the world.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.717
I get it now.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.472
Oh, the children don't want
to be seen in public

17:36.472 --> 17:39.058
having dinner
with an indicted man, huh?

17:40.267 --> 17:41.977
We're not embarrassed of you.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.730
Oh, goodness,
you're embarrassed of me.

17:48.108 --> 17:51.653
Remember how it was for you
when I had my troubles?

17:51.653 --> 17:53.489
Perhaps the kids feel that way.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.742
You were a slum lord.
I was doing the public good.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.452
Junior!

17:58.452 --> 18:00.871
Keister. Seat. Now.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.800
It's important
that we all remember:

18:12.800 --> 18:16.178
I am not, and will never be, convicted,

18:16.178 --> 18:19.181
because I have done
nothing wrong.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.891
Totally.

18:20.891 --> 18:24.103
Absolutely, Dad.
You'll always be our father.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.804
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Thank you.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.056
Can you get a message to him?

19:01.056 --> 19:03.725
No. He hasn't sent one to me.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.185
It's safer this way.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.478
Why do you need him?

19:08.981 --> 19:10.816
It was one thing to help
keep the trains running

19:10.941 --> 19:14.528
when it was just about Prince
staying rich and getting richer.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.822
But I have decided
that he is dangerous.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.702
And I can't be part
of another strongman

19:21.702 --> 19:22.995
entering the world stage.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.414
Ah. There's always strongmen.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.624
Maybe if you know this one,
you can influence him.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.418
And maybe he ain't that bad.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.461
"Maybe he ain't that bad"

19:31.461 --> 19:33.297
is the war cry
of the meek and the defeated.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.716
It's what got us
the last few fucking winners.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.093
It's the key that unlocks
the door that lets the demons

19:38.093 --> 19:39.845
run free, and I don't want
to be holding it.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.347
So drop it and split.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.475
I would, but that leaves
everyone who works there behind.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.187
I'm not prepared to do that.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.190
And I can't think of anyone else

19:51.190 --> 19:52.524
who could stop Prince's rise.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.027
Axe couldn't when he tried.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.362
Look, the time to think
about this was the before-time.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.281
Wherever he is,
whatever he's doing,

19:59.281 --> 20:01.408
he ain't looking backwards.

20:05.078 --> 20:06.622
Don't you miss him?

20:06.872 --> 20:11.043
That's a bit like asking a
caveman hiding from a dinosaur

20:11.043 --> 20:13.587
if he misses the sun.
Of course he does.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.380
But if he goes outside the cave
when it's light out,

20:15.380 --> 20:17.049
he might get eaten.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.217
The cavemen and the dinosaurs

20:18.425 --> 20:19.718
didn't walk the earth
at the same--

20:19.718 --> 20:21.261
As I can hardly believe we were

20:21.261 --> 20:23.013
really and truly here with him.

20:24.139 --> 20:25.307
The whole world is different.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.726
Yes.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.104
Yes to every single word.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.566
Somehow, we have managed
to keep living

20:34.566 --> 20:35.943
without that warm glow.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.238
But I'll tell you,

20:39.238 --> 20:40.948
it's hard living
without daylight.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.160
And I really need his counsel

20:46.536 --> 20:49.122
on how to at least
direct Prince to not, like,

20:49.122 --> 20:50.916
end the fucking universe.

20:50.916 --> 20:54.253
Maybe it's just not
your problem to solve.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.422
So you're okay with just making
the best of it as is?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.717
I am at Wo Hop

21:00.717 --> 21:02.844
with one of my three
favorite people in the world.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.349
This is about
the best version of me

21:07.349 --> 21:09.184
making the best of it
I know of.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.276
Mm-mm. Mm!

21:21.029 --> 21:22.447
Hey, give us a minute,
would you?

21:31.164 --> 21:32.457
How sure are you?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.094
It might be as simple as this.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.680
There's nothing more dangerous

21:46.680 --> 21:48.807
than a man who's sure
he's never wrong.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.563
Add in the money,
add in the intellect.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.356
Smarts is good.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.275
Not when those smarts are used
to strengthen the idea

21:58.275 --> 22:00.402
that no one else's
opinion counts.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.988
And in add his ability
to lie to himself

22:02.988 --> 22:05.407
about who he really is,
and finally,

22:05.407 --> 22:08.910
fold in a textbook
God complex.

22:09.202 --> 22:10.912
He thinks he's God now?

22:10.912 --> 22:13.415
This is a man who's
accomplished

22:13.415 --> 22:16.335
everything he's ever
set out to do.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.879
Again. That's supposed to be
a good thing.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.174
Yeah, it's good.
Right up until the moment

22:22.174 --> 22:23.800
that he decides that
what he needs to do

22:23.800 --> 22:25.677
is take out Russia
or China

22:25.677 --> 22:28.013
or whoever's next on the list, preemptively.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.183
Or that he really needs to do

22:31.183 --> 22:33.310
is to shut up the dissenters
right here.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.896
And then, suddenly,
he's gassing Des Moines.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.899
But, like, that's what half
the guys in office want to do.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.525
Bureaucracy stops 'em.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.403
Not this guy. He steamrolls it.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.698
My job is to listen to what
these men say

22:46.698 --> 22:48.241
and to parse it.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.412
If he gets there,

22:52.412 --> 22:55.874
he won't be stopped by red tape.

22:55.874 --> 22:59.252
Our only chance is
to stop him beforehand.

23:01.338 --> 23:04.383
Otherwise, in his own words,
the country will scream.

23:06.259 --> 23:09.054
And he'll just keep on going.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.390
Then I hope you find Axe.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.058
Because he is the only one

23:13.058 --> 23:15.060
who might have
a chance to prevent it.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.906
Thank you
for meeting me here.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.075
You offered up a slice of
Joe's.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.535
And you're you.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.203
Who's saying no?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.794
I need you to get
a message to Bobby.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.256
If I accept your message

23:44.256 --> 23:46.925
and you told a court of law
I accepted it,

23:46.925 --> 23:48.593
they would interpret it
as my having knowledge

23:48.593 --> 23:49.761
of his whereabouts.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.471
I knew you'd say that,

23:51.471 --> 23:53.014
and I asked you here anyway.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.267
Why would you want
to locate him, theoretically?

23:55.267 --> 23:58.895
Same reason you, uh, look up
your exes on Instagram, I guess.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.313
I don't do that.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.233
Neither do I. But people do.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.736
Makes them feel both connected
and aware of their own growth.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.865
Yeah. That's not why
you want to know.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.284
Everything is murky
right now, Orrin.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.578
Bobby isn't. Never was.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.246
He is clarity.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.957
That is what we need right now.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.626
If by "we" you mean this city,
country and world,

24:21.626 --> 24:23.879
you're damn right we do.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.257
Which is a funny thing to say,
considering he cost me

24:27.257 --> 24:29.092
my good standing with the bar
for six months.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.470
He was worth what he cost.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.971
Is.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.681
I see it the same.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.477
I only wish I was the one
who could deliver him to you.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.526
- You're not?
- I've eaten.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.127
Festive spot.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.172
Especially
at the witching hour.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.049
Yeah.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.968
Well, like Uncle Junior's
doctor's office,

25:11.968 --> 25:14.012
I have this place.

25:14.012 --> 25:17.849
The final resting spot of
a long line of dead Rhoadeses.

25:18.308 --> 25:22.771
My great-grandfather Elijah.
His wife Tig.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.022
Uh...

25:24.022 --> 25:26.525
Grandpa Crawford.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.360
Uncle Cleveland.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.863
And, uh, that one there
is earmarked for me.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.157
And you might as well
slide me in right now

25:34.157 --> 25:36.952
'cause I am a dead man walking.

25:36.952 --> 25:39.371
Let's not get operatic.
You knew the deal.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.831
What I knew was you were
going to tell me the deal.

25:41.831 --> 25:45.710
So I signed, as anyone would
when the choice was steel bars,

25:45.710 --> 25:47.212
but I'm still waiting.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.422
It's better out here
than where you were.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.052
All right,
let's not do it like this.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.887
I want to find
areas of agreement.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.556
Yes, it is better out here,

25:57.556 --> 26:00.642
but now I need
to really understand your plan

26:00.642 --> 26:01.977
so I can go along--

26:01.977 --> 26:03.812
No, no.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.355
Not going to reveal
the whole thing.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.148
I'm just going to do it.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.150
You play your part better

26:09.150 --> 26:10.443
the less you know
about how I'm working it.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.571
I can have all the info.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.739
That way, I not only
play the scene,

26:14.739 --> 26:16.491
I play the whole film.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.910
That shit might work
in a fucking Michael Bay movie,

26:18.910 --> 26:20.745
but this...

26:20.745 --> 26:22.747
this needs to be Kubrick.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.208
Quiet and creeping,

26:25.208 --> 26:27.294
and then suddenly shocking
and perfect.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.088
Dave, I'd never second-guess
a player like you,

26:30.088 --> 26:32.048
but I need be free
of this bullshit

26:32.048 --> 26:34.009
sooner rather than later.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.511
All right.
I heard you in court.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.430
And you know
who else heard you?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.015
Mikey Prince.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.017
So while I'm insistent
on my stance,

26:42.017 --> 26:43.768
I will give you this much:

26:43.768 --> 26:45.729
I am making inroads
at his company,

26:45.729 --> 26:48.189
with his employees.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.442
I get close,
I bleed them for info.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.277
And not the kind of info
they think they're giving me,

26:52.277 --> 26:53.945
but the kind we need.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.740
And you just keep playing possum

26:56.740 --> 26:58.783
in the crosshairs of justice.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.495
What you're doing

27:02.495 --> 27:04.623
is key to my gaining their
confidence, so keep it up.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.834
See you tomorrow.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.086
Or is that already today?

27:10.086 --> 27:13.298
To me, it's all one long day
run together

27:13.298 --> 27:15.800
since I was put
on the chain gang.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.430
Oh, my God.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.940
The strategy I built
for Taylor Mason Carbon

27:30.940 --> 27:33.151
was designed to play out
over longer than a few years.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.944
The results aren't in yet,

27:34.944 --> 27:36.321
but I'm feeling
a "results now" vibe here.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.947
Prince says
you should revamp it.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.241
Transfer the investments over
that still apply.

27:40.241 --> 27:41.993
It's all the same
ownership anyway.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.995
This isn't satisfying,
talking to the lawyer.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.330
It's true, and that's
exactly what you sound like:

27:45.330 --> 27:46.623
the lawyer.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.249
That's a sad characterization.

27:48.249 --> 27:49.918
I'll get over that
on my own time.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.170
And to be honest, nobody
owes you an explanation.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.005
Legally, Prince can do
what he wants to your entity.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.382
He controls it.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.510
But I am here explaining,
listening, as a courtesy.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.096
Because we're all
throwing in here now, right?

28:01.096 --> 28:03.723
You on the financial side,
me on the operations side.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.475
So don't think of me
as the lawyer,

28:05.475 --> 28:07.769
think of me as a part
of Prince's brain.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.146
He's downloaded the things
he wants me on top of.

28:10.146 --> 28:11.815
Whatever happened
in that interrogation room

28:11.815 --> 28:13.483
- clearly forged a bond.
- It's true.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.443
I guess you come apart
at the seams and blubber

28:15.443 --> 28:17.529
all over your lawyer's
shoulder, you get tight.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.947
Is that what happened?
Like Cutler and Gotti?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.240
Or Von Bülow and Dersh.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.450
You won't get a rise out of me,

28:22.450 --> 28:25.078
but what you're missing is
this is good for you.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.455
You're not being partitioned
or siloed off anymore.

28:27.455 --> 28:28.998
You run this entire place.

28:28.998 --> 28:32.210
Trade how you like,
within the parameters,

28:32.210 --> 28:34.963
but, uh, the expectations
are for a field-beating year.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.508
So my crew, computer-driven
and ESG-focused airborne troops

28:38.508 --> 28:40.135
are expected to wade
into the long-short mud

28:40.135 --> 28:41.720
like infantry grunts and win?

28:42.011 --> 28:44.013
That's something I'll have
to go back to Prince with

28:44.013 --> 28:45.807
and, uh, swing back to you.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.434
Better that we see him
and press him on that.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.894
Have to convince him to keep
our internal structure

28:49.894 --> 28:51.229
and offices intact.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.900
Yeah, you might be
a little late for that.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.241
Wait, that's our wall.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.121
Hey.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.547
So I get someone there
to turn.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.174
Who's the most likely,
in your opinion, Chuck,

29:19.174 --> 29:22.218
to know enough
but also to be willing to roll?

29:22.218 --> 29:24.554
All those guys will roll if
the leverage is strong enough,

29:24.554 --> 29:26.014
don't you think, big guy?

29:26.014 --> 29:28.767
The old Uncle Mike
quote applies.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.268
"The plan crumbles upon
impact."

29:30.268 --> 29:31.978
Think he said it
a little more colorfully.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.691
We have a situation.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.401
Reporter out there.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.945
Was signed in by an
assistant AG on a pretext,

29:40.945 --> 29:43.573
blew right by the assistant AG
and marched over to me.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.785
Guy says you need to see him.
If you don't, bad for you.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.203
I can meet him in the lobby.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.246
Says he followed
Mr. Rhoades here.

29:50.246 --> 29:52.707
Knows you are together.
Wants to talk to both of you.

29:52.707 --> 29:54.209
Send one
of the comms people, too.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.461
Reporter said
he'll file his story

29:56.461 --> 29:57.962
the moment he sees
a comms person,

29:57.962 --> 30:00.632
and that it'll explode
like Tex Cobb

30:00.632 --> 30:01.966
in <i>Raising Arizona.</i>

30:03.343 --> 30:06.054
Get him. Bring him slow.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.472
We need to rearrange ourselves

30:07.472 --> 30:09.474
so this looks like
a plea conference.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.317
Oh, fuck. This guy.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.777
You got that right.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.529
This guy.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.322
Only with a different angle.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.492
Hello, Attorney General Mahar.
My name is Lucien Porter.

30:27.492 --> 30:30.495
- I write for--
- I know who you are, Mr. Porter.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.330
But you have to know,

30:32.330 --> 30:33.998
you can't just barge
into a plea conference.

30:33.998 --> 30:37.502
And you have to know,
Miss Mahar, I-I just did.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.212
What do you want?

30:39.212 --> 30:44.050
I want to see both
of your reactions to this.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.719
And any response you may have.

30:46.719 --> 30:48.179
Are we off the record?

30:48.179 --> 30:50.515
Oh, no, we are as on the record

30:50.515 --> 30:55.353
as BB King at Sun Studios in
1950 cutting "Mistreated Woman."

30:57.272 --> 30:58.982
Yeah, the king of the blues

30:58.982 --> 31:00.775
recorded there years before
Elvis the King.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.485
But let's not get off track.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.195
Uh, I'm gonna walk my client
out of here

31:04.195 --> 31:05.947
unless you can
give me reason not to.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.282
How's this for reason:

31:08.908 --> 31:11.202
I have come to think
the world was wrong

31:11.202 --> 31:14.205
about Charles
"Chuck" Rhoades, Jr.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.335
A point of possible agreement. Fascinating.

31:19.335 --> 31:20.587
Wrong how?

31:20.587 --> 31:22.755
Well, I think what I,

31:22.755 --> 31:24.924
and the rest of the world, missed,

31:24.924 --> 31:27.844
is that this man
is a crusader.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.179
A criminal

31:30.179 --> 31:31.931
twice removed from office.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.225
You just made my point.

31:34.225 --> 31:37.186
What if working inside the
structure of the government,

31:37.186 --> 31:39.272
especially in the years
under discussion,

31:39.272 --> 31:42.191
it wasn't possible to really do
the people's bidding

31:42.191 --> 31:44.986
while following
the letter of the law?

31:45.778 --> 31:48.406
I have sources
who have told me--

31:48.406 --> 31:51.576
compelling
and convincing sources--

31:51.576 --> 31:54.412
that Mr. Rhoades
was twice removed

31:54.412 --> 31:56.915
because he refused
to back down to power.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.002
That he was determined
to bring to justice

32:01.002 --> 32:03.087
those few that control all.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.423
Normally,
I'd be thrilled by this,

32:05.423 --> 32:07.884
but I don't trust
your agenda, man.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.427
Good instinct.

32:09.427 --> 32:10.887
I'd see it same from your seat,

32:10.887 --> 32:12.889
Chuck, but I've watched it.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.766
You're the only one who stood
up to the billionaires

32:14.766 --> 32:16.935
with more than words.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.897
The only one who paid a price.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.608
Twice removed,
as the attorney general said,

32:23.608 --> 32:25.568
prosecuted now,
and for what?

32:25.568 --> 32:26.986
For breaking the law.

32:26.986 --> 32:30.490
I prosecute infractions,
not intentions.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.284
That'll be your quote then.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.244
Rhoades, you want
to say something?

32:35.244 --> 32:37.997
Nah. I'm not talking to you.

32:37.997 --> 32:41.000
Even as I agree
that I have been railroaded,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.795
I'm gonna fight my case
and win in court,

32:43.795 --> 32:46.464
and then go about my business.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.342
As you should go about yours,
Mr. Porter, out there,

32:49.342 --> 32:51.469
and leave me to mine in here.

32:51.469 --> 32:55.181
I'll go, but that doesn't mean
I'm leaving you.

32:55.181 --> 32:58.559
Oh. Set that sentiment to music,

32:58.559 --> 33:00.979
and maybe you'll make something
out of your writing.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.563
Goodbye.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.993
It's him. Big Red.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.160
Is he sending out a flare?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.745
Does he want us to see?

33:17.745 --> 33:19.330
If he didn't,
how would I spot it?

33:19.539 --> 33:21.791
Were you chiefing up at the
moment of this big revelation?

33:21.791 --> 33:24.085
That's an insulting question.
And hurtful.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.670
Why does it have to be
that I was chiefing up?

33:25.878 --> 33:28.006
You've been known to partake,
even during work hours.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.300
The idea that I can't hold my
weed is the disrespectful part.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.803
Okay, Mafee,
how did you spot it?

33:33.803 --> 33:37.473
<i>Now, I did happen to be
chiefing up, as discussed--</i>

33:37.473 --> 33:39.392
<i>enjoying some
Nautical Twilight,</i>

33:39.392 --> 33:42.061
<i>as a matter of fact--
at the time I saw it.</i>

33:42.061 --> 33:43.938
No.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.315
Couldn't be.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.360
No way.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.363
But maybe.

33:52.363 --> 33:55.199
<i>So I switched to a sativa</i>

33:55.199 --> 33:57.410
<i>to think through this one.</i>

33:57.410 --> 33:59.287
<i>Diablo Wind, which,</i>

33:59.287 --> 34:00.830
<i>despite its frightening
and evil-sounding name,</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:02.498
<i>is actually cerebral
and perfect</i>

34:02.498 --> 34:03.708
<i>for getting things done.</i>

34:03.875 --> 34:05.084
- Mafee!
- Sorry. Anyway...

34:05.084 --> 34:06.711
at first I'm thinking

34:06.711 --> 34:08.379
I'm looking at some
noise trader.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.298
But then I notice
a technical component to it.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.383
But the sizing was too great.

34:12.383 --> 34:15.053
Yet it wasn't an institution.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.971
- And then...
- When the smoke cleared?

34:16.971 --> 34:20.058
...I realized I was looking
at Semi-Strong Form Efficiency.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.726
Let me see.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.854
Whoever it was, he was fast,
aggressive, sure-footed.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.857
You know I know Axe's trading
style better than anyone.

34:27.857 --> 34:30.735
I've studied it. And this is
him. I'm sure of it.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.570
Uh-huh.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.072
Who put you up
to looking, Mafee?

34:34.072 --> 34:37.575
No. No, this was on my own.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.369
But I didn't want to, like,
commit to the idea

34:40.369 --> 34:42.246
that it was him
without running it by you.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.415
I wasn't going to
tell anyone about it.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.626
Wasn't, you know, tasked.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.303
- Oh. Hello.
- <i>Help me figure out</i>

34:57.303 --> 35:00.139
who asked Mafee to find Axe
through Axe's trades.

35:00.139 --> 35:03.142
I did it. I need to reach him,
but he's gone to ground.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.436
<i>So I figured
he could track him,</i>

35:05.436 --> 35:06.854
<i>and then you could bait him,
using what Mafee knows.</i>

35:06.854 --> 35:08.773
No. No one could bait him.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.150
And no way Mafee sees this
if Axe didn't want to be seen.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.445
<i>Just a sec.</i>

35:16.864 --> 35:19.575
<i>Ah, the Count Basie Orchestra</i>

35:19.575 --> 35:21.035
<i>together again.</i>

35:21.035 --> 35:22.787
Only the Count himself
is missing.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.289
Here's how I figure it.

35:25.289 --> 35:29.210
You followed protocol,
said he was unreachable,

35:29.210 --> 35:30.628
then told him
I wanted to connect

35:30.628 --> 35:32.296
because you can reach him,

35:32.296 --> 35:34.215
<i>and then he had to have
a little fun.</i>

35:34.215 --> 35:36.134
<i>Ah.</i>

35:36.134 --> 35:38.719
<i>Did Mafee notice a certain
signature trading style</i>

35:38.719 --> 35:40.388
<i>in the energy sector?</i>

35:40.388 --> 35:42.140
I was right!
Fuck yeah!

35:42.140 --> 35:43.266
I knew there was something
about that guy.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.559
Chief on that.

35:44.851 --> 35:47.979
I think the big guy just
wanted to know how serious

35:47.979 --> 35:50.439
you were about connecting.
And now he does.

35:50.439 --> 35:53.484
I am tempted to engage in
all of this, but not enough.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.654
I'm done with intrigue,
with palace coups.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.322
I just want to keep
building my war chest.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.824
Just keep making money
and strengthening my rep

35:59.824 --> 36:01.033
in this fucking business,

36:01.242 --> 36:03.161
which is becoming
increasingly difficult

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
with the latest bullshit
at the firm.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.790
We're not done
talking about this.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.000
We are for now.

36:11.627 --> 36:13.171
But it is weirdly
perfect timing, Mafee,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.964
I'll grant you that.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.465
I've been thinking about you
and your shop.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.842
Its demise, really.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.106
Wow.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.360
Hello, Pop.

36:38.112 --> 36:41.282
Oh, no, I will accept
your congratulations for sure,

36:41.282 --> 36:43.618
even as this is a small--

36:43.618 --> 36:45.453
Oh, I got another call
coming in.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.787
Let me get you back.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.707
Eisen!

36:49.832 --> 36:52.293
Capital to hear from you,
my good m--

36:52.501 --> 36:55.087
And thank you for letting me
know you saw it.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.464
Yes.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.633
It is good to see that the
right story is finally--

36:58.633 --> 37:02.220
Uh, there's my front door.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.721
Yeah.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.056
Okay.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.725
Back to you soon, pal.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.356
Holy fuckballs.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.776
That Lucien Porter,
he did it!

37:16.776 --> 37:18.027
- This piece...
- Hmm.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.654
...this piece basically says

37:19.654 --> 37:21.530
you're the Robin Hood
of New York City.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.158
It says you were the only
person in the city, the country,

37:24.158 --> 37:25.993
who risked personal welfare

37:25.993 --> 37:27.912
to try to put the crooked
billionaires away.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.580
Well, I was.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.332
I am.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.585
You...

37:34.585 --> 37:37.421
you acted surprised
when Porter barged in.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.674
But you weren't, were you?

37:39.674 --> 37:44.095
Well, get to our age, nothing
much surprises, does it?

37:44.095 --> 37:46.722
- If this gets momentum...
- Sure.

37:46.722 --> 37:49.267
If everything lined up just so,

37:49.267 --> 37:52.144
if this really was the time for
me to assume my rightful pl--

37:55.147 --> 37:57.775
The message that Porter
is putting out in the world,

37:57.775 --> 38:00.987
that the very government I was
supposed to be working for

38:00.987 --> 38:04.198
instead fought against me
to stop me from doing

38:04.198 --> 38:06.617
the exact thing
the people wanted...

38:06.617 --> 38:08.452
<i>They're holding him up
as a hero</i>

38:08.452 --> 38:10.162
<i>who actually does
what he says.</i>

38:10.329 --> 38:13.374
...arresting bad-faith actors
of great wealth and power,

38:13.374 --> 38:16.168
well, now who knows
what could sprout from that.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.379
<i>Students who got
a taste of fairness</i>

38:18.379 --> 38:21.632
<i>when they thought their loans
would be forgiven</i>

38:21.632 --> 38:23.759
might take to the streets!

38:24.093 --> 38:27.930
I could see your Al Sharptons
and your Nicole Wallaces

38:27.930 --> 38:29.557
getting into the act.

38:29.557 --> 38:33.436
Your Warrens, your Sanderses,
your AOCs.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.647
All righteously outraged

38:36.647 --> 38:39.400
<i>that a true champion
who tried to carry their fight</i>

38:39.400 --> 38:40.985
<i>was snuffed out.</i>

38:40.985 --> 38:43.237
This might make
that same champion

38:43.237 --> 38:47.450
into the kind of public hero
who's very hard to keep down.

38:48.993 --> 38:52.496
Yeah, and even harder
to prosecute.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.166
The president's going to let
the State of New York decide

38:55.166 --> 38:57.835
whether this case against
Mr. Rhoades is warranted.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.046
So you set all that up, too,
didn't you?

39:00.046 --> 39:01.839
It's gonna happen.

39:02.214 --> 39:07.011
Once again, I think it's fair
to say it won't surprise me.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.032
I have a spot in my pod
if you're interested.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.784
I've clocked
some of your trades.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.410
I like what I see.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.455
Okay, rad. I've come to see you
are a many-sided figure.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.708
I mean, more than the eyes
and ears first.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.378
- Uh, cool. We'll join you.
- Yeah, cool, where do we--?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.837
There's one seat available.

39:41.837 --> 39:43.172
One.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.715
Both of us together,
or neither.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.013
I'm gonna go with neither.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.598
Good luck.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.895
That was really heartening,
the way you backed me.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.563
It reminded me
of seventh grade

39:59.563 --> 40:01.399
when I was the new kid
in the cafeteria and--

40:01.399 --> 40:03.067
Save it, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>
That's French.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.735
Hold the roll, you two.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.695
We're not accepting
this new reality.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.072
Find a place to post up
for the moment

40:08.072 --> 40:09.615
until I can talk to Prince.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.787
Pod next to us is open.

40:14.787 --> 40:16.247
We can compare notes.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.415
Yeah. I know what it's like

40:17.415 --> 40:19.208
being a bird without a nest.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.459
It sucks.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.129
Mmm.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.425
In my envisioning,

40:27.425 --> 40:29.218
this isn't like
a hierarchal thing.

40:29.218 --> 40:31.554
This is just like two guys
making decisions together.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.472
Two alphas.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.933
Pearl and Clyde in the Knicks
backcourt together.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.601
Earl "the Pearl" Monroe
sacrificed ten points a game

40:37.601 --> 40:39.437
to come to New York.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.397
I mean, he went from being
the leader of the team

40:41.397 --> 40:43.274
and top scorer in the league

40:43.274 --> 40:45.276
to being the third option
on Clyde's team.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.778
Do you want me to be the third
option on Michael Prince's team?

40:47.778 --> 40:49.989
They won championships, Mark.
And with all the good

40:49.989 --> 40:51.615
that you're doing
with the drug thing--

40:51.615 --> 40:54.618
The drug thing
is Cost Plus Drugs.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.203
If you're going to run
for the top slot,

40:56.203 --> 40:57.538
if you're going
to run the press gauntlet,

40:57.538 --> 40:59.457
you're going to do that.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.959
I'm just putting it out there
that we could do it together.

41:01.959 --> 41:05.754
Announce a year before anybody
puts their VP list together.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.465
I take the bulk
of the scrutiny,

41:07.465 --> 41:09.633
and we are kicking butt
like Nick Bockwinkel

41:09.633 --> 41:11.969
and Ray "the Crippler" Stevens.

41:11.969 --> 41:15.139
Look, I'm more a Terry Funk
guy, but regardless.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.308
The only thing that matters
more to me than my country

41:17.308 --> 41:19.018
is my family.

41:19.018 --> 41:20.603
And there's just no way
I'm gonna put them

41:20.603 --> 41:22.188
through an election cycle.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.274
Especially not to be your VP
or anybody's VP.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.527
But, you know,
I really get the sense

41:28.527 --> 41:30.988
that you asked me up here
just to find out

41:30.988 --> 41:32.990
if I was gonna run
against you.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.826
You really just wanted to
confirm that the coast was

41:35.826 --> 41:38.496
clear for you to run
as an independent.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.539
Well, I'm not, and it is.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.999
But come on, Mike.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.376
Next time,
just call me and ask me.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.712
Save us both some time, okay?

41:52.051 --> 41:54.011
I assume you've seen this?

41:54.011 --> 41:56.722
Ah, the epic tale of our city's
very own Eliot Ness.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.516
Do you know
where it will lead?

41:58.516 --> 42:00.184
Because I do.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.353
Into the annals of folklore.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.313
Which is not where I want
to take my prosecution.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.690
- No, it can't be an accident.
- I saw it going down.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.234
It didn't turn out
the way I thought.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.194
Isn't that, like,
Chuck's specialty?

42:10.194 --> 42:12.613
Look, we both want this guy
found guilty,

42:12.613 --> 42:14.114
which is what
you were promising to do.

42:14.114 --> 42:15.533
What is it you want me
to do about it?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.660
You're a brilliant player.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.370
Make some of them bold moves.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.330
Make the Bezos play.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.207
- Buy the paper?
- Yeah!

42:23.207 --> 42:26.001
But go farther than him.
Kill stories like this.

42:26.001 --> 42:28.212
Have them write
the opposite ones.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.214
Yeah, a purchase like that
doesn't fit my needs right now.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.675
Nor does taking shrapnel
for steering the editorial bent

42:32.675 --> 42:33.926
of a major paper.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.844
Oh, of course, I forgot.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.722
Is it too soon to start
calling you Mr. President?

42:38.722 --> 42:41.684
It is. But it's not too soon
for you to put Chuck away,

42:41.684 --> 42:43.352
which is what
you promised to do,

42:43.352 --> 42:44.937
instead of leaving openings
for him to exploit.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.064
I don't tell you what stocks
to buy and when,

42:47.064 --> 42:48.607
so you can save
your dime-store critique

42:48.607 --> 42:50.484
of my case-building, dude.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.114
Sorry to interrupt, but this

42:55.114 --> 42:57.074
is about business of the day.

42:57.074 --> 42:59.159
You were told to wait, to talk
to Sacker and Scooter and Wags.

42:59.159 --> 43:00.703
We did talk.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.746
Guess it didn't take.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.415
We were told you wanted us
to run your company,

43:04.415 --> 43:05.916
so we need to talk to you
about it.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.167
I'm... I'm sorry
about this timing,

43:07.167 --> 43:08.586
but this is kind of urgent.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.670
- If you could--
- Yeah, yeah.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.505
Thanks, Mike.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.799
Seems like everything's
running great for you.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.598
The whole idea was that you
weren't going to micromanage.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.516
This is macro.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.351
The whole place, right?
The structure of the place.

43:24.351 --> 43:26.103
The physical plant.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.230
Within that structure,
you two make the calls.

43:28.230 --> 43:30.357
- Stepped right into that one.
- But you are right.

43:30.357 --> 43:33.277
This is an operations call,
and we are operating the firm.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.820
Except our square peg personnel

43:34.820 --> 43:36.905
are getting muscled
into round holes.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.741
This functioned perfectly
in a separate--

43:38.741 --> 43:41.285
I can't-- we can't have
two different vehicles.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.578
It can't appear
that you have split focus,

43:42.578 --> 43:43.621
and you can't have split focus.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.164
Because you're going to.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.457
I focus fully on whatever
I'm looking at.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.292
And when those walls came down,

43:48.292 --> 43:49.752
you had to know
they weren't going back up.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.962
- So, what do you want?
- Let me.

43:53.881 --> 43:55.924
Taylor, Philip,

43:55.924 --> 43:59.219
this whole place needs to feel
that it is looking to you two,

43:59.219 --> 44:00.721
and that you two
are looking back.

44:00.721 --> 44:02.348
A direct engagement.

44:02.348 --> 44:04.266
And you know who else
needs to feel that,

44:04.266 --> 44:07.978
that you are wholly,
100% invested in making money,

44:07.978 --> 44:11.148
gobs of it,
for Michael Prince Capital?

44:11.148 --> 44:13.025
Is that guy right there.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.487
It's the one thing
that will free him

44:16.487 --> 44:18.906
to go and get done
that which he must.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.870
For all of us.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.003
What she said.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.008
Fine. We accept the new
conditions, but with a demand.

44:38.008 --> 44:40.177
We need to make
a key hire or two

44:40.177 --> 44:41.804
of the kind of folks
who understand

44:41.804 --> 44:43.347
that whole
"gobs of money" thing.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.515
Especially in--
even in the kind of markets

44:44.515 --> 44:45.724
we are dealing with now.

44:45.724 --> 44:46.975
I'll meet your prospectives,

44:46.975 --> 44:48.227
just to rubber-stamp--

44:48.227 --> 44:49.978
No way.
Unless we fuck one up,

44:50.354 --> 44:52.398
we hire who we want to fulfill
our needs. That's our condition.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.525
And we need to be able
to get time with you

44:54.525 --> 44:56.193
when we need counsel.
Sacker is great.

44:56.193 --> 44:58.153
You're great, Kate.
As are Scooter and Wags.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.571
But there are big decisions
we will need

44:59.571 --> 45:00.864
the direct Mike magic on.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.783
You'll keep Wags and Scooter informed.

45:02.783 --> 45:05.661
And Sacker on anything legal
or legal adjacent.

45:05.661 --> 45:08.414
And I'll make myself
available weekly.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.791
But you two need
to run this place profitably

45:10.791 --> 45:14.461
while I work on banging
this country back into shape.

45:14.461 --> 45:17.047
It's been said one is either
a hammer or an anvil.

45:18.674 --> 45:20.050
Good people have been
the anvil for too long.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.316
I know you're tight with them,
that you have relationships,

45:36.316 --> 45:38.861
and it's no fun taking the
position you have to on this.

45:38.861 --> 45:41.321
But it's necessary,
and I appreciate it.

45:41.321 --> 45:43.157
Hey, I'm your house counsel.

45:43.157 --> 45:46.702
The gig is to protect you
against all threats,

45:46.702 --> 45:48.412
foreign and domestic.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.289
And I can't get
to where I'm going

45:50.289 --> 45:52.207
until you get to where
you're going first.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.590
You hear that shit?

46:00.215 --> 46:01.425
Hammer and anvil?

46:01.633 --> 46:03.552
That's fucking Hitler
from Munich in '29.

46:04.887 --> 46:06.263
Is he hoping
people won't notice,

46:06.263 --> 46:07.431
or that they will?

46:07.765 --> 46:09.725
I'm not sure.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.771
But we've got to
figure this the fuck out.

46:17.065 --> 46:19.026
<i>The jig is up
The news is out</i>

46:19.026 --> 46:22.029

46:25.949 --> 46:28.452

- It'll only take a minute.

46:30.913 --> 46:32.289
What the fuck?

46:32.289 --> 46:34.291
I got to nail
the doggy door shut.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.210
Your wife let us in.

46:41.673 --> 46:44.468
Who's he, your dentist?

46:44.468 --> 46:45.803
I don't even know
what that means.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.387
We've met, like, twice.

46:47.387 --> 46:48.514
What happened?

46:48.722 --> 46:50.265
You had a whole office
and a company.

46:50.265 --> 46:51.975
Now you have a garage
and a bathrobe.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.144
If I think the word "blowjob,"

46:54.144 --> 46:56.647
I want to be able
to say the word "blowjob."

46:56.647 --> 46:59.191
- Naturally.
- You're trying to be funny,

46:59.191 --> 47:00.776
but you get it, right?

47:00.776 --> 47:02.528
I mean, the Street these days,

47:02.528 --> 47:05.531
it's a woke fucking preschool.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.866
You miss rolling out mats
for naptime

47:07.866 --> 47:10.619
and skip juice boxes once,
it's a major fucking felony.

47:10.619 --> 47:13.163
You had culture problems
at the office.

47:13.163 --> 47:15.123
Culture. Ugh.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.793
You either earn,
or you do not.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.837
And you started losing your
analysts, then your traders,

47:19.837 --> 47:21.380
and even your back office.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.798
Then your outside money.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.633
- Then, even Mafee.
- He told you?

47:24.633 --> 47:26.343
I smelled it on him.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.178
Well, despite all that bullshizzle,

47:28.178 --> 47:29.680
I'm still a gunslinger.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.181
And a gunslinger's
what we need.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.933
For what?

47:32.933 --> 47:34.518
Philip and I run Michael
Prince Capital together.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.436
Yeah, I heard something
about that.

47:36.436 --> 47:38.480
Props to you.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.232
We're here to offer you
a PM job.

47:41.984 --> 47:43.986
- Is that right?
- Yes.

47:43.986 --> 47:45.863
We'd start you off
with your own book,

47:45.863 --> 47:47.531
20% more capital under
management than when you left.

47:47.531 --> 47:49.700
Yeah, and what about
the Great Gazoo over there?

47:49.700 --> 47:51.451
How long before he starts
getting up in my business?

47:51.451 --> 47:52.953
You mean Prince? He won't.
He left it to us.

47:53.161 --> 47:54.830
It's true.
He's busy with other projects.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.790
And while he did dictate
overall expectations,

47:56.790 --> 47:58.500
he leaves the strat
and execution to us.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.295
A lot of latitude.
A lot of freedom.

48:01.295 --> 48:04.882
Yeah, I know latitude
means freedom in this context.

48:08.343 --> 48:09.720
Can I say "blowjob"?

48:09.720 --> 48:11.805
Yes, but not to anyone.

48:11.805 --> 48:13.265
Yeah, not in anyone's presence,

48:13.265 --> 48:14.725
but you can think it
loud as you want.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.476
Then I pass.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.395
- So you're happy here?
- Like a pig in shit.

48:18.395 --> 48:21.106
Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob!

48:21.106 --> 48:23.650

48:42.461 --> 48:43.921
Oh.

48:43.921 --> 48:46.006
Now that's my kind of approach.

48:46.006 --> 48:47.549
We were supposed
to be in this together,

48:47.549 --> 48:49.343
but you decided
to go off-roading.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.178
Well, you made me ashamed
to be seen in public.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.429
Divided my family.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.264
And you shut me out.

48:54.264 --> 48:56.224
It created a vacuum of trust.

48:56.224 --> 48:59.895
Chuck, this is making
my job harder.

48:59.895 --> 49:01.730
And you were the one
who wanted to take him down

49:01.730 --> 49:03.315
- in the first place.
- Yeah.

49:03.315 --> 49:04.858
I am the one
supposed to take him down.

49:04.858 --> 49:06.526
Or maybe I'll do nothing.

49:06.526 --> 49:08.862
Either way,
I won't do it in custody.

49:08.862 --> 49:10.989
Oh, my God.

49:10.989 --> 49:13.533
You're a student of history,
so you know that Federal Hall

49:13.533 --> 49:15.827
was the original seat
of government in the colonies.

49:15.827 --> 49:17.955
Sure. It's where
George Washington

49:17.955 --> 49:19.623
took the first oath of office.

49:19.623 --> 49:22.960
Bunch of very conflicted men
with a lot of flaws.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.252
Lots.

49:24.252 --> 49:25.963
To be sure.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.881
But they were trying
to transcend themselves

49:27.881 --> 49:29.883
with what they were doing in
there, what they were building.

49:29.883 --> 49:33.220
They weren't doing it so that
one day a bunch of plutocrats

49:33.220 --> 49:35.639
could live with more power
than the king they'd fled.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.849
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

49:37.849 --> 49:39.977
Even though you were under
a gag order.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.812
Maybe for once,
something just worked out.

49:41.812 --> 49:45.148
No. There are calls for
your release all over the city.

49:45.148 --> 49:47.317
Politicians.
Civic leaders.

49:47.317 --> 49:49.236
There are goddamn marches
being planned,

49:49.236 --> 49:52.072
making it real tough
to empanel an unbiased jury.

49:52.072 --> 49:54.157
I've got the governor
on my call sheet,

49:54.157 --> 49:56.076
and I have a feeling
I know what it's about:

49:56.076 --> 49:57.744
dropping the case against you.

49:57.744 --> 49:59.663
I were in your shoes,

49:59.663 --> 50:01.665
I'd tell them
to fuck themselves.

50:01.665 --> 50:04.126
Of course, we know where
that attitude got me.

50:04.126 --> 50:06.670
Bounced out of office. Twice.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.339
You're making your only friend
into your enemy.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.841
Not the first time.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.280
All right, you motherfuckers!

50:34.406 --> 50:36.533
When that bell rings,
I'm coming out of the gates

50:36.533 --> 50:37.993
like I ain't been fed
for a week.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.703
Better try and stay with me

50:39.703 --> 50:41.204
or get ready to look
real fucking bad

50:41.204 --> 50:42.706
come comp time.

50:47.085 --> 50:48.754
I'm not sure I like this.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.464
Am I supposed
to like this?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.090
Like you said,
we had to give them something.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.800
This guy, though?

50:53.800 --> 50:55.218
I can't have a whiff
of how he used to do it.

50:55.218 --> 50:56.928
I can't have it.

50:56.928 --> 50:58.722
I'll be sure to keep him
on a tight leash.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.057
Make it a choke collar.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.398
This smells good, doesn't it?

51:10.233 --> 51:11.902
- Hi, Chuck.
- Nice to see you, Chuck.

51:12.110 --> 51:14.237
- It's great to see you.
- Everybody's talking about you.

51:14.237 --> 51:16.323
Well, that's good to hear.
Thank you.

51:19.451 --> 51:21.870
You seem to be
enjoying yourself.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.747
Well, you do the right thing
for the right reason,

51:23.747 --> 51:26.458
the rest just seems
to take care of itself.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.919
It's supposed to, yes.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.629
- Hey, care to join us?
- No.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.048
I just, uh, came to drop off
Eva's bag.

51:33.048 --> 51:34.424
She left it at my place.

51:34.424 --> 51:36.384
She's staying
with you tonight.

51:36.384 --> 51:37.886
- I have a thing came up at work.
- You know, old days,

51:38.136 --> 51:40.472
busy as you were, you rarely
missed a night with the kids.

51:40.472 --> 51:43.433
Old days. Yeah, well,
a lot was different.

51:43.433 --> 51:45.602
Uh-huh. Bye.

51:54.444 --> 51:55.946
Right this way, folks.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.614
I know, it's impressive,
isn't it?

51:57.614 --> 51:59.574
- Very old.
- It's crazy.

51:59.574 --> 52:02.119
Keep together
for a good look at the tower.

52:02.119 --> 52:05.455
At various times a prison,

52:05.455 --> 52:09.084
a fortress,
a royal residence.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.752
For hundreds of years,

52:10.752 --> 52:13.088
this was the start
of a procession

52:13.088 --> 52:14.589
to Westminster Abbey

52:14.589 --> 52:17.551
for the coronation
of a new monarch.

52:17.551 --> 52:19.177
Stirring spot, isn't it?

52:25.142 --> 52:27.477
And I think I understand
why you picked it.

52:29.354 --> 52:35.026
But I was surprised
this was the meet.

52:35.026 --> 52:37.112
I thought I'd have to take
a longer flight to see you.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.322
Maybe blindfolded,

52:39.322 --> 52:41.324
so I couldn't lead them
back to you, even under duress.

52:43.201 --> 52:45.328
Well, you know,
geopolitics is fluid.

52:47.038 --> 52:48.832
Early in the conflict,

52:48.832 --> 52:52.210
Ukraine wanted Javelin
anti-tanks, other things.

52:52.210 --> 52:54.129
Western governments weren't
able to get them there first.

52:54.129 --> 52:56.131
You?

52:56.131 --> 52:57.674
Structured the deal.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.178
Took care of the financing.
Arranged a friend--

53:01.178 --> 53:03.013
a guy you would not expect--

53:03.013 --> 53:06.683
to find and deliver
the actual arms.

53:07.684 --> 53:09.477
Bought me a great deal
of goodwill

53:09.477 --> 53:11.479
all across the continent,
EU and here.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.815
Who's better than you
at seeing something like that

53:13.815 --> 53:15.442
and figuring out
how to make a trade of it?

53:15.442 --> 53:18.069
Your guy Prince
must be better, right?

53:19.321 --> 53:20.906
Don't call him my guy.

53:22.741 --> 53:23.950
Even for you, that's harsh.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.327
You're at that company
every day.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.120
He must be doing
something right.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.622
I didn't come over here
for the cracks.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.123
I came over here
for your help, Bobby.

53:31.625 --> 53:32.876
Walk away.

53:32.876 --> 53:34.294
Not how I roll.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.173
We built that place,
you and me.

53:38.173 --> 53:39.549
If I leave...

53:39.549 --> 53:41.551
Look, it's still intact,
for now.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.595
But it won't be if the guy
who's running it

53:43.595 --> 53:44.888
keeps going the way he is.

53:44.888 --> 53:46.723
The people
won't be intact.

53:46.723 --> 53:48.725
What am I supposed to do,
fix it?

53:48.725 --> 53:51.603
It's not just the firm
I'm worried about.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.063
I'm worried the damage
he's going to do

53:53.063 --> 53:54.898
is even greater outside.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.942
But, yeah, let's...
let's start with figuring out

53:56.942 --> 53:59.152
how we protect
the thing that we made.

54:01.863 --> 54:04.950
If that's why you've come,
you're not alone.

54:13.375 --> 54:14.584
Well, shit.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.713
Look what we have here.

54:18.713 --> 54:20.507
Luke, Leia, and Chewie.

54:23.301 --> 54:25.804
All that's missing is Han
and the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

54:30.058 --> 54:32.227
I guess that's
where I come in.

54:32.227 --> 54:35.605
<i>London calling
To the faraway towns</i>

54:35.605 --> 54:39.567
<i>Now war is declared
And battle come down</i>

54:39.567 --> 54:42.821
<i>London calling
To the underworld</i>

54:42.821 --> 54:45.949
<i>Come out of the cupboard
You boys and girls</i>

54:45.949 --> 54:50.078
<i>London calling
Now don't look to us</i>

54:50.078 --> 54:53.915
<i>Phony Beatlemania
Has bitten the dust</i>

54:53.915 --> 54:57.335
<i>London calling
See, we ain't got no swing</i>

54:57.335 --> 55:00.797
<i>Except for the ring
Of the truncheon thing</i>

55:00.797 --> 55:04.551
<i>The ice age is coming
The sun's zooming in</i>

55:04.551 --> 55:08.305
<i>Meltdown expected
The wheat is growing thin</i>

55:08.305 --> 55:11.474
<i>Engines stop running
But I have no fear</i>

55:11.474 --> 55:13.268
<i>'Cause London is drowning</i>

55:13.268 --> 55:17.147
<i>And I live by the river</i>

55:17.147 --> 55:20.942
<i>London calling
To the imitation zone</i>

55:20.942 --> 55:24.404
<i>Forget it, brother
You can go it alone</i>

55:24.404 --> 55:27.824
<i>London calling
To the zombies of death</i>

55:27.824 --> 55:30.410
<i>Quit holding out
And draw...</i>
