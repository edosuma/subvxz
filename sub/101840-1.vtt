00:23.500 --> 00:29.791
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

00:33.666 --> 00:36.875
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:56.375 --> 00:58.958
STRASBOURG

00:59.041 --> 01:04.250
NOVEMBER 1968

02:10.916 --> 02:11.750
Mr. Gary.

02:18.375 --> 02:23.000
That man looks really ill. Who is he?
Wasn't he here yesterday as well?

02:23.083 --> 02:26.625
He's been here all week.
He's an Italian engineer.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.333
That weird car outside, is that his?

02:29.416 --> 02:30.791
Yes, it is.

02:30.875 --> 02:35.375
He desperately wants you
to read a file he's brought.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.291
I didn't want to bother you with it.

02:37.833 --> 02:42.208
Did you tell him we deal with disputes
between sovereign states?

02:42.291 --> 02:44.416
He says he's a head of state,

02:44.500 --> 02:48.125
and that he won't leave
until I give you the file.

02:49.291 --> 02:52.250
He's a bit crazy but also very determined.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.916
This is what we're going to do.

02:54.458 --> 02:58.416
Hand me the file,
and make it look like a big deal.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.333
Here's the file I told you about.

03:08.416 --> 03:10.541
Thank you.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.458
I'll read it very carefully.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.791
Very well. Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.833
Where is he?

04:09.916 --> 04:13.000
-Who?
-The mad man with pneumonia.

04:13.083 --> 04:15.041
-I managed to get rid of him.
-No!

04:15.625 --> 04:18.041
Bring him to my office.
I need to talk to him.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.166
Come on, quick!

04:24.041 --> 04:26.875
<i>Mr. Rosa, I have to ask you</i>
<i>if you know what day it is</i>

04:26.958 --> 04:28.708
and where you are.

04:28.791 --> 04:31.333
November 10th, 1968,

04:32.083 --> 04:34.250
Strasbourg, Council of Europe.

04:35.833 --> 04:39.250
And what can the Council of Europe
do for you, Mr. Rosa?

04:39.916 --> 04:41.291
Save my island.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.250
Did you buy an island?

04:43.833 --> 04:45.041
No, I made it.

04:46.291 --> 04:47.375
He created an island.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.750
How many days did it take you
to create this island?

04:50.833 --> 04:54.083
Please, don't say six,
that would be an incredible coincidence.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.750
No, it wasn't six days.
It took me several months.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.458
So you own an island
that you have created.

04:59.541 --> 05:05.333
No, I didn't say that.
I'm an engineer. I simply built it, then…

05:06.541 --> 05:08.416
we created the world on the island…

05:08.500 --> 05:11.416
I should just leave.
This man's in a confused state.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.541
He needs help but clearly not from us.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.916
I need help from the European Council.
That's why I'm here.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.583
Keep calm, Mr. Rosa.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.333
I can't keep calm.
They're going to destroy everything.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.458
Is this the island that you built?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.333
Yes, like I said, I'm an engineer.

05:32.916 --> 05:38.500
<i>Doctor, my ass! Piss off!</i>

05:38.583 --> 05:42.583
ONE YEAR EARLIER

05:42.666 --> 05:45.833
<i>Doctor, my ass! Piss off!</i>

05:45.916 --> 05:51.250
<i>Doctor, my ass! Piss off!</i>

05:51.333 --> 05:53.500
If I may, we're already doctors.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.833
We've passed our exam,
so now we're engineers not--

05:56.916 --> 06:01.875
<i>Engineer, my ass! Piss off!</i>

06:01.958 --> 06:03.375
What the hell are you doing?

06:06.541 --> 06:08.833
<i>Forfeit!</i>

06:08.916 --> 06:11.958
What forfeit?
I was just talking… It's not fair!

06:12.041 --> 06:14.500
Guys, he's right.
If you challenge a professional--

06:14.583 --> 06:17.000
-You stole my glass!
<i>-Forfeit!</i>

06:17.083 --> 06:19.458
What? I was talking
about the engineer thing.

06:19.541 --> 06:23.125
They insist.
I'd say a fair forfeit could be…

06:23.791 --> 06:25.875
to have him…

06:25.958 --> 06:28.791
make a complete ass of himself!

06:30.958 --> 06:33.166
-But these aren't the rules…
<i>-Ass of himself!</i>

06:33.250 --> 06:35.333
-I didn't lose!
<i>-Ass of himself!</i>

06:35.416 --> 06:37.875
So, the first girl that walks in,

06:37.958 --> 06:40.791
he must chat her up,
and when she least expects it,

06:40.875 --> 06:43.208
he kisses her on her lips!

06:44.916 --> 06:45.791
Shit!

06:46.875 --> 06:48.000
Hi.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.083
How's it going?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.208
It's good to see you.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.125
I'll be right there.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.875
-Yes.
<i>-Kiss!</i>

06:56.958 --> 06:58.250
Well, it's…

06:58.333 --> 07:01.291
It's just that today
we took our state exam.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.500
I'm now officially an engineer.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.416
-Congratulations!
-Thanks.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.666
Guys, we can't do the kiss thing.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.333
We can't do that…

07:12.000 --> 07:15.333
They want me to kiss you,
because I lost a drinking game.

07:15.416 --> 07:17.291
-Sure.
-I didn't even lose.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.333
They're just insisting because…

07:19.916 --> 07:22.833
Guys. We can't do that.
We just can't do that.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.541
Guys, it's not gonna happen.

07:24.625 --> 07:27.250
Right, there's no point
that they keep saying…

07:27.333 --> 07:29.333
We just can't do that, you know…

07:29.416 --> 07:30.291
You look good.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.541
You look very good.

07:34.625 --> 07:35.458
Honestly.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.000
Thanks.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.625
Fancy a drink?

07:43.666 --> 07:44.916
Well, anyway…

07:45.000 --> 07:48.208
It's a funny coincidence
running into each other here--

07:48.291 --> 07:50.750
Not really. Bologna isn't a big town.

07:51.666 --> 07:52.833
Yeah, sure.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.041
Last time we saw each other,

07:57.083 --> 07:59.333
you were seeing that guy, that--

07:59.416 --> 08:01.333
-Carlo.
-Carlo, that's right.

08:01.416 --> 08:03.958
Carlo.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.208
He's not here, is he?

08:07.041 --> 08:09.041
We've been having problems lately.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.708
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.833
No, you're not.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.708
Come on, it was clear that you were…

08:17.791 --> 08:21.125
Well, that your relationship was like…

08:21.208 --> 08:22.500
just a temporary one.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.791
How long have you been together?
A few months?

08:24.875 --> 08:25.708
Three years.

08:25.791 --> 08:26.708
Three years?

08:27.791 --> 08:29.458
That's almost as long as we were.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.750
I guess your parents like him.

08:33.666 --> 08:36.000
-Why are you having problems?
-My parents liked you.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.958
Your dad hated me. You didn't answer me.

08:38.041 --> 08:40.000
Well, maybe he hated you a bit, but…

08:40.083 --> 08:43.125
not much considering
he nearly lost his sight

08:43.208 --> 08:46.291
when you blew up his TV
during the Italy vs. Russia match.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.416
And you never apologized to me or him.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.166
It imploded,
and you're still not answering.

08:51.250 --> 08:54.875
We fell out because after three years,
he believes we should get married.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.875
-Imploded?
-I knew there was something.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.208
Get married? Be careful about marriage.

08:59.291 --> 09:00.833
He's not the right man.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.916
How do you know if you don't know him?
Now <i>you're </i>not answering.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.833
The cathode tube implodes,
it doesn't explode.

09:06.916 --> 09:08.416
Electrons flow through the vacuum.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.666
And I told your father a thousand times
to sit further away.

09:11.750 --> 09:15.041
I just wanted him to enjoy
the football match. Those three lines--

09:15.125 --> 09:16.625
Sorry, Giorgio. It's eleven o'clock…

09:16.708 --> 09:18.583
How can you watch a match with lines?

09:18.666 --> 09:21.250
-I have to go. I've got a class tomorrow.
-Wait.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.083
I'll drive you home.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.958
Since when do you have a car?

09:39.791 --> 09:41.708
Excuse the interior.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.750
I built this car for the engineering exam.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.541
I thought it'd be interesting
to make something practical.

09:48.625 --> 09:52.000
And I focused a bit more
on the engine than the interior.

09:52.875 --> 09:56.833
To speed things up,
I used my grandma's sofa as seats.

09:56.916 --> 09:58.416
She's dead now anyway.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.916
-Grandma Margherita is dead?
-Yes, two months ago.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.666
-She couldn't take our breaking up.
-We split up three years ago. Come on.

10:04.750 --> 10:08.500
Yes, it was a slow decline.
She deteriorated slowly.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.791
-Giorgio…
-Can you remind me why we split up?

10:13.125 --> 10:15.875
Because being with you is too risky.

10:15.958 --> 10:19.291
You have to take risks
if you want to try and change the world.

10:19.375 --> 10:22.666
You're hardly changing the world
getting rid of three lines on a TV.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.500
-It's beautiful, you know?
-What is?

10:29.125 --> 10:31.166
-The car.
-Thank you!

10:31.791 --> 10:34.750
It's weird, but…

10:35.750 --> 10:39.500
you built a car by yourself,
and it works. It runs!

10:39.583 --> 10:41.791
It might not be Diabolik's Jaguar but--

10:41.875 --> 10:43.875
Whose Jaguar did you say?

10:45.083 --> 10:46.083
Diabolik's.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.750
-<i>Diabolik, The King of Terror.</i>
-Who's he?

10:48.833 --> 10:50.625
The new comic everyone's talking about!

10:50.708 --> 10:53.416
-Never heard of it, honestly.
-It's great.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.708
Basically, it's about
this very clever thief

10:57.375 --> 11:01.458
who always wears… who always wears a mask…

11:02.583 --> 11:05.333
-They want us.
-Do they? Okay, let's pull over.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.083
Hello.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.500
Yes.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.500
-Good evening.
-Evening.

11:31.583 --> 11:35.625
Is there a reason why
this vehicle has no license plate?

11:35.708 --> 11:39.291
Because I didn't buy this vehicle.
I actually built it.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.250
This car has no license plate?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.791
To be honest,
I didn't think about that at all.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.875
All right, if you want to be funny,
step outside, please.

11:46.958 --> 11:51.416
Driving license and registration.
Salvatore, check their criminal records.

11:54.666 --> 11:55.541
And here we are.

11:57.791 --> 11:59.041
Let me explain.

11:59.125 --> 12:03.416
I built this car with my own hands,
because I'm an engineer.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.916
So it's the same principle
as with the license plate.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.333
I don't have a registration
nor driving license--

12:09.416 --> 12:12.083
You drove me around
without a driving license?

12:12.708 --> 12:15.250
-I drove you. I didn't force you, did I?
-Yes.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.125
-You insisted.
-I insisted?

12:17.208 --> 12:20.375
I'd have never driven you around Bologna
in a car with no plate,

12:20.458 --> 12:22.041
no driving license, half-drunk--

12:22.125 --> 12:23.500
Did you say "drunk"?

12:23.583 --> 12:24.750
No, I'm not drunk.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.333
I lost a drinking game.
Actually, I didn't lose--

12:27.416 --> 12:29.958
Salvatore, so do these two
have criminal records?

12:30.041 --> 12:33.000
I'm a lawyer, address us politely.
We're not "these two," thanks.

12:33.083 --> 12:36.291
That's right. She's my lawyer.

12:36.375 --> 12:37.333
So let's keep calm.

12:37.416 --> 12:41.375
Giorgio, I'm not your lawyer.
I'm an international law associate.

12:41.458 --> 12:44.041
Bummer. Bloody useless international law…

12:44.125 --> 12:45.375
Nothing on the lady.

12:45.458 --> 12:48.791
-But Rosa has a criminal record.
-What about Rosa?

12:48.875 --> 12:51.791
That's not a criminal record,
it's a flying ban.

12:51.875 --> 12:53.750
They're two totally different things.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.000
And as per the judge's order,
I disassembled the biplane.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.708
I worked two summers
to pay for those street lights.

12:59.791 --> 13:02.083
-Please…
-You flew an unregistered plane?

13:02.166 --> 13:06.166
Yes, I did. What's with this fixation
with registering everything?

13:06.250 --> 13:09.541
Shall we also put a plate
on the bottom of each bird that's flying

13:09.625 --> 13:10.791
in Piazza Maggiore?

13:10.875 --> 13:14.750
Salvatore, his car's in the way.
Move it, then call the tow truck.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.875
You don't need to. Salvatore, I can do it.

13:17.958 --> 13:20.750
You'll break it.
You don't know how to start it.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.916
Stand back.
This vehicle is being impounded.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.208
Impounded?
You must be joking. Salvatore, wait!

13:27.291 --> 13:30.625
-Salvatore, stop. You'll break it!
-Stand back.

13:30.708 --> 13:32.666
-Didn't you hear me?
-You'll break it.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.375
-Listen!
-I'm listening!

13:34.458 --> 13:35.666
-Stop!
-Don't touch him.

13:35.750 --> 13:39.083
-He's touching everything.
-Keep your hands down!

14:04.041 --> 14:06.458
There was no need for you to come.

14:06.541 --> 14:10.666
They didn't need to wake you up for that.
I was handling it just fine.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.416
The judge was going to convict you
because you're a repeat offender.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.000
They're different things.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.208
This one happened on the ground,
the other one was air-related.

14:19.291 --> 14:23.041
Why don't you just try, Giorgio?

14:23.125 --> 14:25.000
-Try what?
-To be normal.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.916
You'd be happier. Look at yourself now.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.500
What are you talking about?
Listen to yourself, "Be normal"…

14:32.583 --> 14:36.375
I managed to meet Battistini
and showed him the blueprints of your car.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.125
He was so impressed,
he wants you on his team of engineers.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.458
Dad, don't show my stuff to people.
It's private.

14:42.541 --> 14:44.875
It's a sought-after position.
You should be glad.

14:46.208 --> 14:49.458
Yes, I know, Dad. Thanks.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.416
Could you please pull over?
I want to get out.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.541
-Why don't you come home?
-I want to get out.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.375
Just stop the car and let me out!

14:59.791 --> 15:02.000
Where are you going now?

15:04.250 --> 15:08.583
Called to answer charges
for crimes against humanity,

15:08.666 --> 15:11.250
the Nazis appealed to the positive law,

15:11.958 --> 15:16.625
alluding to their famous phrase,
"We were just following orders."

15:16.708 --> 15:19.500
In other words, "We were obeying the law,"

15:19.583 --> 15:23.000
which, no matter how brutal,
was still the law.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.958
To this avoidance of responsibility,

15:26.041 --> 15:29.791
the judges would respond
by appealing to natural law.

15:30.375 --> 15:34.666
Natural law is
that innate sense of justice

15:34.750 --> 15:39.500
which exists in each one of us
reminding us that it's more important…

15:39.583 --> 15:40.500
Can you move over?

15:40.583 --> 15:42.875
…to prioritize what is right
over the rules,

15:42.958 --> 15:45.583
what is right over the law.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.750
Because laws change,

15:47.833 --> 15:49.958
while what is right will always be right.

15:54.791 --> 15:56.041
And this,

15:57.208 --> 16:00.916
doesn't mean that obeying the law
is not important,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.916
on the contrary, it's extremely important.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.875
Especially the driving laws,
the traffic codes,

16:06.958 --> 16:08.333
even license plates are important.

16:08.416 --> 16:10.416
Right. That's it for today.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.833
I'll see you next week.
Chapter three, The Tokyo Trial.

16:13.916 --> 16:16.125
Professor,
the class only lasted ten minutes.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.958
Because these are complex concepts
which take time to comprehend,

16:20.041 --> 16:23.666
especially for you, Nicolini,
who's already failed three times.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.000
You're coming with me.

16:26.625 --> 16:27.500
Sorry.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.958
Excuse me. Sorry.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.000
Do you know what these are?

16:34.541 --> 16:36.208
Blue fingertips?

16:36.291 --> 16:38.500
They took my fingerprints, Giorgio.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.958
-They already had mine.
-<i>My</i> fingerprints!

16:41.041 --> 16:43.666
I'm applying for tenure in six months.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.083
I can't take the exam
if I have a criminal record.

16:46.166 --> 16:50.291
The evening didn't end well,
that's why I'm here, to apologize.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.458
Didn't end well? We were arrested!

16:52.541 --> 16:55.166
Okay, it ended badly then. A tragedy.

16:55.916 --> 16:57.875
But… what happened before that…

16:58.958 --> 16:59.958
can't be ignored.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.250
-Giorgio, you live in your own world.
-Don't you like it?

17:03.333 --> 17:06.000
No, I don't,
because it ends with getting arrested.

17:06.583 --> 17:10.416
Because you live in your own world,
but this world isn't all yours!

17:10.500 --> 17:13.291
-You didn't build it like your car!
-Then maybe I should.

17:13.875 --> 17:14.958
Should what?

17:15.041 --> 17:16.958
Build my own world.

17:17.041 --> 17:18.708
Giorgio, it was a metaphor.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.208
-Would you come?
-You can't build a world!

17:21.291 --> 17:23.000
-Maybe I can--
-No, you can't!

17:24.375 --> 17:27.791
Because you're not a genius,
even though you think you are!

17:28.875 --> 17:32.625
You build toys
that keep getting you arrested.

17:33.708 --> 17:36.416
And for a second, I nearly forgot that.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Goodbye, Giorgio.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.541
THREE MONTHS LATER

19:01.125 --> 19:02.583
One second 40.

19:02.666 --> 19:04.958
One second 40 on the fourth lap?

19:05.041 --> 19:07.000
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.791
What shitty tires did we put on?

19:08.875 --> 19:11.000
Luca, we knew it was risky.

19:11.083 --> 19:14.083
That's not a risk. That's goddamn suicide!

19:14.166 --> 19:15.625
We must tell Bruno.

19:15.708 --> 19:18.541
Change the strategy, go flat-out,
either it works or it doesn't.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.000
Flat-out from the fourth lap?

19:20.083 --> 19:22.708
Either that
or we get there half an hour later!

19:22.791 --> 19:25.708
Hey, go to corner seven
and show this to Bruno.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.875
What the hell are you waiting for?
Hurry up! Go!

19:28.958 --> 19:31.333
-Who the hell is that?
-He's the new guy.

19:31.416 --> 19:33.666
Battistini says he's a great engineer.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.666
He looks like a moron to me.

20:28.791 --> 20:34.291
OUR PLATFORMS, YOUR ENERGY, YOUR FREEDOM

21:21.625 --> 21:25.708
<i>Sir, I swear we wouldn't even dream</i>
<i>of going anywhere near your safe.</i>

21:25.791 --> 21:27.375
Angelo, I understand,

21:27.458 --> 21:31.291
but this is the third time this year
that money has gone missing

21:31.375 --> 21:32.708
and it's only February.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.625
Dad, don't worry about this.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.750
I'll deal with it.

21:37.875 --> 21:38.708
It's…

21:39.291 --> 21:42.708
impossible to describe the pain

21:43.416 --> 21:46.333
that you people, with your greed,

21:47.166 --> 21:50.708
have caused to this company,
to this family,

21:50.791 --> 21:52.750
and to this righteous man.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.875
This man who welcomed you
in your time of need.

21:55.958 --> 22:00.541
When you people,
dressed only in desperation,

22:00.625 --> 22:04.666
arrived here
from your remote and wild lands.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.916
And how did you repay him?

22:07.708 --> 22:10.583
By stealing from the hand that fed you.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.000
Mr. Maurizio,

22:13.083 --> 22:14.541
there's no proof it was us.

22:16.916 --> 22:17.750
Angelo.

22:18.666 --> 22:21.208
Angelo, how can you say
something like that?

22:21.791 --> 22:25.333
In the safe, there were
five bills of 50,000 lire.

22:25.416 --> 22:29.041
Now there are none,
and the only Calabrians here…

22:29.708 --> 22:32.416
are you guys. Or am I wrong?

22:32.500 --> 22:34.958
They've got some nerve…

22:35.041 --> 22:37.208
They're the only ones here, right?

22:44.458 --> 22:45.708
I have to go now,

22:45.791 --> 22:49.208
because we have a company to run,
even though…

22:49.791 --> 22:53.000
it'll be more challenging
from today because of you guys.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.083
<i>So we're building a platform.</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:58.458
We're making an island.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.666
Okay, I get it,
but in the shape of a platform.

23:00.750 --> 23:01.708
It's an island!

23:01.791 --> 23:04.916
Initially, I wanted to build
a real one with sand and everything.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.041
And I spent months trying to find a way.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.916
But it's impossible, Maurizio.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.375
But then…

23:11.458 --> 23:13.083
I saw the solution.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.500
An island made of steel.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.583
-Steel!
-Steel…

23:17.666 --> 23:22.041
Can you imagine? Our own island,
where we can do what the hell we want.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.500
Where we can live by our own rules.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.750
So I won't have to work
for my dad anymore?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.666
Of course not!

23:28.750 --> 23:31.333
Because I hate this shipyard.
Do you understand?

23:31.416 --> 23:33.625
I hate smelling the stink of it every day.

23:33.708 --> 23:36.833
The stink of the grease of the ships,
the gas, the Calabrians.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.416
Listen, do you think
we can have a bar too?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.791
A bar where we can drink
what the hell we want?

23:41.875 --> 23:43.166
Yes, of course.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.666
Well, I wouldn't make it
the main attraction, but yes.

23:46.750 --> 23:50.208
-Where do you want to build this island?
-This is the best part.

23:50.291 --> 23:52.708
Outside Italian territorial waters.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.250
Where nobody can bust our balls.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.833
And where is it? Is it far?

23:57.625 --> 23:58.750
Wherever we want.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.083
As long as it's six miles off the coast.

24:01.791 --> 24:03.125
I was thinking here,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.250
opposite Rimini.

24:05.333 --> 24:06.250
Perfect.

24:06.833 --> 24:07.916
Where do we start?

24:09.708 --> 24:12.083
<i>We look at how they build platforms.</i>

24:47.791 --> 24:49.166
So how do they do it?

24:49.250 --> 24:52.916
Pillars of 34 with reinforced
concrete foundations on the bedrock.

24:53.500 --> 24:57.125
-How big are the foundations?
-I don't know, they're big.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.750
-What do you mean? 90, 150?
-I don't know. I didn't measure them!

25:00.833 --> 25:02.083
You go next time.

25:02.166 --> 25:05.708
Come on, help me up.
Hurry, before someone calls security.

25:06.583 --> 25:10.250
Let's recap.
One underwater concrete injector.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.000
Then what? About 30 pillars?

25:12.083 --> 25:13.083
Yes, about that.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.625
Say we build them as thin as 90.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.583
Then we need to hire ten skilled workers.

25:18.666 --> 25:22.875
And even if we hire Calabrians,
no insurance, no payroll taxes,

25:22.958 --> 25:25.708
and we fire them
with a random excuse in the last week

25:25.791 --> 25:29.000
and we pay them nothing,
that's 100 million gone already.

25:29.083 --> 25:31.041
If we got rid of the concrete?

25:31.125 --> 25:33.833
We'd get down to 80,
but the problem is transportation.

25:33.916 --> 25:39.250
To move 30 pillars of 90 for six miles,
we'd need a cargo boat.

25:39.333 --> 25:42.708
If they were made of wood,
we could float them there.

25:43.666 --> 25:45.958
It can't be made of wood,
it has to be steel.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.833
I've been told steel doesn't float.

25:55.000 --> 25:55.833
Well…

25:56.583 --> 25:58.208
that ship's made of steel,

25:58.291 --> 26:01.291
and by some weird magic
that I've never understood,

26:02.000 --> 26:02.875
it does float.

26:11.666 --> 26:14.083
So steel doesn't float,

26:14.916 --> 26:16.791
but hollow steel does.

26:19.375 --> 26:22.875
With hollow pillars,
we solve the problem of transportation.

26:22.958 --> 26:26.583
I get it, but how can we build
a platform on hollow, empty pillars?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.125
I never said empty.

26:28.791 --> 26:30.625
Once they're in the right spot,

26:30.708 --> 26:32.208
we open up one end,

26:32.916 --> 26:34.000
and what happens?

26:34.083 --> 26:35.291
It fills with water,

26:36.583 --> 26:38.208
and it sinks to the bottom.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.875
We'll build the island
with filled pillars,

26:41.625 --> 26:42.958
but filled with water.

26:54.208 --> 26:56.166
I'll pay you back for the pillars.

26:56.250 --> 26:59.666
Don't worry.
For 700,000, I won't go hungry.

27:00.541 --> 27:01.750
What, 700,000 lire?

27:03.625 --> 27:05.416
Where did you get all that money?

27:05.500 --> 27:08.125
I usually steal it from my father's safe.

27:08.875 --> 27:12.291
-Doesn't he notice?
-Of course he does. It's 700,000 lire.

27:12.375 --> 27:15.166
I blame the Calabrians who work for him.

27:15.250 --> 27:17.750
He reports them, or he fires them.
I'm not sure.

27:17.833 --> 27:20.416
I think this is it, here.
Turn off the engine!

27:25.916 --> 27:26.791
Here we are.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.708
If my calculations are correct,

27:30.416 --> 27:31.833
from this point on,

27:32.416 --> 27:34.458
we are outside territorial waters.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.583
We're no longer in Italy, Maurizio.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.500
We're in international waters.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.291
No one's in charge here!

27:45.291 --> 27:48.125
Nobody can tell us what to do,

27:48.208 --> 27:51.375
what not to do,
and stuff like that, Maurizio.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.250
We're free!

27:53.833 --> 27:54.791
Maurizio!

27:55.833 --> 27:56.666
Maurizio.

27:58.041 --> 27:59.583
Hey, Maurizio.

28:00.875 --> 28:01.791
Listen…

28:02.375 --> 28:03.750
now comes the tricky part.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.791
-I know.
-We need to unplug the tubes.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.791
It's one thing doing it in a bathtub,
and quite another on the open sea.

28:10.875 --> 28:13.958
Remember, lift up the slider,

28:14.541 --> 28:16.375
and get away as quickly as you can.

28:16.458 --> 28:21.041
-I got it. You told me a million times!
-Because it's dangerous.

28:21.125 --> 28:24.541
Can't you smell the freedom?

28:25.333 --> 28:29.708
Not really, Maurizio.
I can only smell some cheap herbal liquor.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.791
You're already drunk at 8 a.m.?

28:31.875 --> 28:33.500
Did you think I could do this sober?

28:35.458 --> 28:36.708
I can't believe this.

28:38.458 --> 28:39.333
By the way,

28:40.125 --> 28:41.208
it's peach grappa.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.875
I see.

28:47.916 --> 28:48.750
Come on.

28:49.541 --> 28:50.416
You go, man!

28:50.958 --> 28:52.041
Be careful!

28:53.666 --> 28:55.291
It's all in your hands now!

28:56.458 --> 28:57.625
All in your hands!

28:58.958 --> 28:59.791
Remember.

29:00.833 --> 29:02.625
Remember, move away immediately.

29:03.916 --> 29:07.291
Keep in mind all the steps.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.083
Open the slider and get out of the way!

29:09.166 --> 29:11.500
Move away immediately. Okay?

29:12.250 --> 29:13.666
Do you hear me, Maurizio?

29:14.916 --> 29:15.875
Can you hear me?

29:20.875 --> 29:21.833
Can you hear me?

29:23.625 --> 29:24.500
Of course not.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.333
It's working!

29:43.458 --> 29:45.083
No, Maurizio!

29:45.166 --> 29:48.875
Why didn't you listen to me?
I told you to move away immediately!

29:48.958 --> 29:51.333
He never listens!
He has to do things his way!

29:51.916 --> 29:53.750
Look what's happened to him now!

29:53.833 --> 29:57.750
Now I'm stranded here on the boat,
in the middle of the sea!

29:57.833 --> 29:59.333
Well done!

30:07.583 --> 30:08.791
It works!

30:10.625 --> 30:12.208
It works!

30:12.291 --> 30:16.416
It's the best day of my life!
I want to do it again! Come on!

30:23.625 --> 30:26.833
<i>So you two transported some pillars,</i>

30:26.916 --> 30:31.375
installed them on the seabed,
built a 400-square-meter platform

30:32.166 --> 30:33.708
and nobody said anything?

30:33.791 --> 30:34.708
That's correct.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.958
Not until we got the drill.

30:39.708 --> 30:40.583
The drill?

30:41.541 --> 30:42.416
Yes.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.125
<i>To look for drinking water.</i>

30:44.625 --> 30:48.166
<i>To be an independent island,</i>
<i>you need to have your own water.</i>

30:48.875 --> 30:50.500
<i>So we had to drill.</i>

30:55.500 --> 30:59.583
Can't we turn this drill off?
It's been three days. It's driving me mad!

30:59.666 --> 31:01.958
Maurizio, water is essential!

31:02.041 --> 31:04.708
If you're worried
about the cost of the drill,

31:04.791 --> 31:09.291
we'll have to budget better,
counting the workers and all that.

31:09.375 --> 31:12.541
Come on!
We're not really going to pay them!

31:12.625 --> 31:14.541
They're actually grateful to us.

31:14.625 --> 31:18.708
They were this close to jail.
They stole millions from my dad's safe!

31:19.291 --> 31:21.125
Wasn't that you?

31:21.208 --> 31:23.708
Not according to the prosecutor in Rimini.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.291
Right.

31:26.958 --> 31:31.041
What a pain. Turn it off for a second.
And then we'll turn it back on.

31:31.625 --> 31:33.958
You can't just flip a switch.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.500
It's not a toaster.

31:35.583 --> 31:37.333
<i>Coastguard to…</i>

31:38.208 --> 31:40.291
<i>unidentified island.</i>

31:40.375 --> 31:46.625
<i>You're required to identify yourselves,</i>
<i>and to immediately cease all activities.</i>

31:46.708 --> 31:49.916
No, we can't turn it off just like that.
There's no switch!

31:50.000 --> 31:51.125
Last warning.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.916
The illegal occupation of public airwaves

31:54.000 --> 31:57.875
<i>is a criminal offense punishable</i>
<i>with immediate detention if in flagrante.</i>

31:57.958 --> 32:00.708
-Public airways?
-He doesn't get it. Let me talk to him.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.166
This is not…

32:02.666 --> 32:06.666
a toaster that you can switch on and off.
And we're in international waters!

32:06.750 --> 32:09.958
And most importantly,
we're not a radio. We're not.

32:10.041 --> 32:11.041
No!

32:11.125 --> 32:13.458
He thinks the drill
is a transmitting antenna.

32:13.541 --> 32:16.958
We're not transmitting.
We don't use airwaves. It's just a drill.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.500
We're looking for water.

32:20.791 --> 32:22.333
We're looking for water.

32:22.416 --> 32:24.333
Did he say they're looking for water?

32:24.416 --> 32:25.500
Did he understand?

32:26.583 --> 32:27.541
What do they mean?

32:30.791 --> 32:33.083
Why are you looking for water
in the middle of the sea?

32:35.666 --> 32:36.875
Well, because…

32:38.541 --> 32:40.666
To create an independent state.

32:41.416 --> 32:45.000
An independent state
with or without radio?

32:45.083 --> 32:46.875
Without radio!

32:47.708 --> 32:49.125
A state without radio.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.791
Perfect.

32:50.875 --> 32:53.666
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day!

32:53.750 --> 32:54.750
You too.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.666
-More water?
-I'm okay, thanks.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.750
Let's go
and take the Calabrians back to shore.

33:41.750 --> 33:42.916
You know what?

33:43.791 --> 33:45.250
I think I might stay here.

33:46.166 --> 33:47.000
Here where?

33:47.083 --> 33:48.250
Here, on the island.

33:49.250 --> 33:50.250
We have everything.

33:50.750 --> 33:53.916
We have water, coffee. We have everything.

33:54.625 --> 33:56.541
And it's a beautiful, sunny day.

33:57.250 --> 33:58.750
I'll spend my first night here.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.291
Are you sure?

34:01.125 --> 34:04.166
Why did we build an island
if we're not going to stay on it?

34:04.250 --> 34:05.583
I'm definitely sure.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.000
Anyway…

34:12.250 --> 34:13.208
it's beautiful!

34:15.083 --> 34:16.875
Shit. This is incredible.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.541
Thank you, Maurizio.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.500
Thank you.

34:34.583 --> 34:37.791
Listen, better not to hug
in front of the Calabrians.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.041
Do you mind?

34:39.125 --> 34:41.625
Yes, sure. You're right. Sorry.

36:55.583 --> 36:56.541
Hey!

37:04.833 --> 37:06.583
Hey!

37:07.541 --> 37:09.000
What is that?

37:09.083 --> 37:14.041
This is a free and independent island!
We even have drinking water--

37:14.125 --> 37:17.750
Okay, you can tell me later!
Help me up, please!

37:18.875 --> 37:20.333
Pietro Bernardini.

37:21.375 --> 37:25.583
Officially, a welder.
He'd been living on his boat for months,

37:26.666 --> 37:30.958
and he became
the first resident of the island.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.958
-Was the first resident really a castaway?
-Yes.

37:37.125 --> 37:40.875
There appears to be another resident too.
A stateless man of German origin

37:40.958 --> 37:42.083
whose name is…

37:43.541 --> 37:46.666
whose name is…

37:48.166 --> 37:49.083
Neumann.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.166
Wolfgang Rudy Neumann.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.833
Correct.

37:54.916 --> 37:57.541
Wolfgang Rudy Neumann.

38:07.416 --> 38:12.416
<i>Legend has it that in 1943,</i>
<i>Neumann was forced to join the army</i>

38:12.500 --> 38:15.125
<i>and was sent to Rimini</i>
<i>to defend the Gothic Line.</i>

38:15.208 --> 38:16.833
<i>But as soon as he saw the beach,</i>

38:16.916 --> 38:19.125
<i>he knew what he wanted to do</i>
<i>with his life.</i>

38:19.208 --> 38:22.791
<i>Without even thinking about it,</i>
<i>one night he runs away from his camp</i>

38:22.875 --> 38:25.958
<i>and goes to the town hall</i>
<i>to ask for a beach concession.</i>

38:26.041 --> 38:29.916
<i>This is how the legend</i>
<i>of Wolfgang Rudy Neumann was born,</i>

38:30.000 --> 38:33.291
<i>the greatest promoter</i>
<i>on the Romagna Riviera.</i>

38:40.291 --> 38:43.791
Rudy! Come here!

38:44.375 --> 38:48.583
<i>But at the end of the war,</i>
<i>he was charged with desertion</i>

38:48.666 --> 38:52.000
<i>and his German citizenship was revoked.</i>

38:52.750 --> 38:53.833
Yes, Peppe?

38:53.916 --> 38:56.333
Did I ever tell you
what my father did for a living?

38:56.416 --> 38:59.416
-No, Peppe. You didn't.
-He was a buffalo farmer.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.000
And guess what buffalo smells of?

39:02.250 --> 39:03.083
Cows?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.333
Shit.

39:05.041 --> 39:07.708
I went to the toilet earlier,
and I was almost moved.

39:07.791 --> 39:10.708
It reminded me of my childhood.

39:10.791 --> 39:14.791
How many times do I have to tell you
you need to check them every 20 minutes,

39:14.875 --> 39:18.875
and clean the shit off the floor,
off the walls, off the sink,

39:18.958 --> 39:20.166
and off the toilet seats?

39:20.250 --> 39:21.750
Why do I have to do that?

39:21.833 --> 39:24.625
Who's bringing
all these people who shit here?

39:24.708 --> 39:27.750
That's what I do, bring people to clubs.
That's what you pay me for.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.458
No, I pay you because I'm a benefactor.

39:30.541 --> 39:33.666
If you don't like it,
why don't you open your own beach club?

39:33.750 --> 39:36.458
You know why. They only give permits
to Italian citizens.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.708
Open one in Germany then.

39:38.791 --> 39:41.000
I'm not a German citizen either.

39:41.083 --> 39:43.791
So, buddy, off you go then.

39:50.958 --> 39:53.833
Did you hear they're building
an island off Rimini?

39:53.916 --> 39:55.291
They're building an island?

39:55.375 --> 39:58.458
Yeah, some crazy guy from Bologna.
It's absurd.

39:58.541 --> 40:00.750
What do they plan to do with it?

40:00.833 --> 40:05.166
It's outside territorial waters,
you can do what you want, apparently.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.666
I tell you what,
we can party big time there.

40:07.750 --> 40:11.750
<i>A round of applause to the best promoter</i>
<i>on our Riviera, Rudy Neumann!</i>

40:14.375 --> 40:18.750
-I mean, you built all this by yourselves?
-Yes, we did.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.541
Why the hell did you do that?

40:22.750 --> 40:25.916
For the same reason
a dog licks his own balls.

40:28.083 --> 40:29.333
I don't get it.

40:31.041 --> 40:32.125
Because he can.

40:34.583 --> 40:35.416
What do you mean?

40:36.250 --> 40:39.250
A dog licks his own balls because he can.

40:39.333 --> 40:42.041
We are engineers,
we wanted to build an island,

40:42.125 --> 40:44.250
we could do it, so we did it.

40:45.625 --> 40:48.416
I don't get the balls thing,
you lick your own balls--

40:48.500 --> 40:50.250
No, we don't lick our balls.

40:50.333 --> 40:53.708
It was a way of saying
we wanted to create our own world

40:53.791 --> 40:57.166
where we'd feel really free,
and we did it. We built it.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.833
Is that a naked man shaving?

40:59.916 --> 41:02.041
Yes, his name is Pietro. He lives here.

41:03.166 --> 41:04.041
On the island?

41:04.583 --> 41:07.625
Yes, he's a castaway.
He's not much of a talker but…

41:07.708 --> 41:11.541
I can only count three things here though.
A semi-deserted island,

41:11.625 --> 41:14.791
water that's almost fresh,
and a half-naked castaway.

41:14.875 --> 41:16.291
Not much of a free, new world.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.125
Wait a minute,
I can count three things too.

41:19.208 --> 41:23.375
A German deserter,
a promoter that nobody knows, and--

41:24.291 --> 41:27.583
I can't even think of a third one.
This guy comes in criticizing--

41:27.666 --> 41:30.333
You don't do that.
We don't have to welcome everyone.

41:30.416 --> 41:32.666
These are the people
we should be welcoming.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.208
Castaways, deserters…

41:34.291 --> 41:37.583
Here no one really cares
who you are or where you're from.

41:37.666 --> 41:40.416
He says this now,
but he did all this for a girl.

41:40.500 --> 41:41.916
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.833
Does this place have a name?

41:48.208 --> 41:50.458
BOAT TRIP TO THE NEW STEEL ISLAND

41:50.541 --> 41:53.541
DEPARTS 10:30 EVERY MORNING
RETURNS 17:45

42:04.666 --> 42:06.958
<i>With Rudy Neumann, everything changed.</i>

42:07.708 --> 42:10.291
<i>It was an incredible and instant success.</i>

42:14.958 --> 42:18.916
<i>Rumors about a free, independent state</i>
<i>spread like wildfire.</i>

42:19.500 --> 42:21.791
<i>First along the Romagna Riviera,</i>

42:21.875 --> 42:23.375
<i>then all across Italy.</i>

42:23.458 --> 42:25.875
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>people were arriving from all over Europe,</i>

42:25.958 --> 42:30.000
<i>to see for themselves</i>
<i>what sounded like a miracle.</i>

42:43.333 --> 42:46.083
<i>And it also happened at the perfect time.</i>

42:49.041 --> 42:52.166
<i>That was a year that made history.</i>

42:52.250 --> 42:55.458
<i>And that everyone recalls</i>
<i>just by the last two numbers,</i>

42:55.541 --> 42:57.500
<i>six and eight.</i>

43:07.750 --> 43:10.458
<i>We didn't know much</i>
<i>about the French riots of that May.</i>

43:11.250 --> 43:14.291
<i>Except that they took to the streets</i>
<i>and set Paris on fire,</i>

43:14.375 --> 43:16.041
<i>calling for a better world.</i>

43:16.125 --> 43:20.583
<i>As for us, we actually built</i>
<i>that "better world" ourselves.</i>

43:20.666 --> 43:24.125
Today, May 1st, 1968,

43:24.208 --> 43:27.583
five hundred meters
outside territorial waters,

43:27.666 --> 43:31.708
free from everything,
we're making history!

43:31.791 --> 43:36.500
Here, you are truly free!

43:39.333 --> 43:42.083
Welcome to Rose Island!

43:55.416 --> 43:56.708
We need a language.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.333
What do you mean?

44:00.041 --> 44:01.708
People come from all over Europe.

44:01.791 --> 44:04.375
We need an official language
that's not Italian

44:04.458 --> 44:06.875
and not from another country.

44:06.958 --> 44:09.333
A free international language.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I don't think it exists, unfortunately.

44:13.458 --> 44:14.791
I believe it does.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.791
ROSE ISLAND

44:27.791 --> 44:29.958
THE MYSTERY OF THE ISLAND
REVEALED IN RIMINI

44:30.041 --> 44:31.791
THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IS ESPERANTO

44:31.875 --> 44:35.583
<i>For the press, we were</i>
<i>more important than national politics,</i>

44:35.666 --> 44:39.333
<i>than student riots,</i>
<i>and even the Vietnam War.</i>

44:39.416 --> 44:42.208
ROSE ISLAND
RUDY NEUMANN TO BE THE NEW PROMOTER

45:29.041 --> 45:29.875
Shit.

45:40.916 --> 45:41.875
Are you leaving?

45:41.958 --> 45:43.500
Yes. I'm pregnant.

45:44.416 --> 45:45.416
Pregnant?

45:45.500 --> 45:46.916
What do you mean "pregnant"?

45:47.750 --> 45:49.916
Oh my God, how do I tell my mother?

45:51.416 --> 45:54.791
It's not yours, idiot.
We only met last night.

45:58.333 --> 45:59.291
Here.

46:00.625 --> 46:03.500
-Pietro, did you only get Cynar?
-People love Cynar.

46:04.500 --> 46:08.541
Okay, no doubt about that,
but they might want something else too.

46:08.625 --> 46:09.875
Can you hurry up?

46:09.958 --> 46:12.875
I heard from the pier,
they're expecting it to be packed today.

46:12.958 --> 46:15.833
-How's it going with the bar?
-He only got Cynar.

46:15.916 --> 46:18.500
-I think people really love Cynar.
-Maurizio?

46:18.583 --> 46:21.125
Weren't you meant
to go shopping with him?

46:21.208 --> 46:23.791
I'm only marginally involved
in this project.

46:23.875 --> 46:26.458
Please, don't start again
with the name story.

46:26.541 --> 46:28.208
Yes, I will.

46:28.291 --> 46:30.875
Because it was a beautiful
and elegant name.

46:30.958 --> 46:34.375
"Maurizio and Giorgio's island"
wasn't beautiful nor elegant.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.333
Yes, it was.
There's a girl staring at you.

46:40.666 --> 46:41.500
Oh, God.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.875
One of you must go and talk to her.

46:44.958 --> 46:47.083
-Tell her I died in Vietnam.
-Hi.

46:47.166 --> 46:49.833
Hi! Nice to see you. What a surprise!

46:49.916 --> 46:51.083
I'm pregnant.

46:51.166 --> 46:56.291
I have a certificate of sterility
issued during the war certifying that--

46:56.375 --> 46:58.500
Look, I'm not sure it's yours.

47:00.041 --> 47:00.958
What do you mean?

47:01.041 --> 47:03.125
Well, there are several options.

47:03.208 --> 47:05.083
That's not nice.

47:05.166 --> 47:07.541
A girl shouldn't really go around saying--

47:07.625 --> 47:10.458
I've heard this place is amazing
but the bar sucks.

47:11.083 --> 47:14.083
I need a job. And it looks like
you need a bar attendant.

47:47.333 --> 47:48.541
-Get up.
-What?

47:48.625 --> 47:50.125
Come on, get up!

47:53.000 --> 47:55.416
It's getting worse by the minute here.

47:55.500 --> 47:59.583
The German's getting people to sign up
for an end-of-summer water-ski race.

47:59.666 --> 48:03.625
Do you think that's normal?
Was this the great idea we had?

48:03.708 --> 48:06.708
Because if you're talking of a free world,
I have a different view.

48:06.791 --> 48:07.750
And what's that?

48:07.833 --> 48:10.083
A big poker tournament.

48:10.166 --> 48:11.625
-A gambling house?
-No!

48:11.708 --> 48:14.333
We'll play for shots. Shots of grappa.

48:14.416 --> 48:17.083
If you lose, you drink,
if you win, you drink,

48:17.166 --> 48:19.625
and if anyone wants to play with money,
we can't say no.

48:19.708 --> 48:22.208
But that's not the point,
just as long as we both agree.

48:22.291 --> 48:25.000
I'll stop him
before he collects money off people.

48:25.083 --> 48:27.291
Let's talk about it later. Maurizio!

48:27.791 --> 48:28.666
Hey!

48:53.708 --> 48:55.833
That's the thing they do most often.

48:56.583 --> 48:59.916
They throw their clothes away,
shirts, ties, everything.

49:00.000 --> 49:02.375
Not sure why, but many of them do that.

49:04.291 --> 49:06.041
Is that your girlfriend?

49:06.916 --> 49:07.750
Who?

49:08.916 --> 49:11.083
That one there, the bar attendant.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.416
Come on! She's pregnant.

49:14.125 --> 49:15.166
Is it yours?

49:15.250 --> 49:19.666
What? No!
She doesn't know whose baby it is.

49:19.750 --> 49:23.125
She doesn't care.
She said there were a few options.

49:23.208 --> 49:29.083
She symbolizes this place,
a young, free-spirited, pregnant girl.

49:29.166 --> 49:33.041
She wouldn't have found
a job on the mainland, but here…

49:34.250 --> 49:38.416
You know, I'm happy to see you.
I knew you'd come sooner or later.

49:38.500 --> 49:42.416
-Everyone's talking about it in Rimini.
-You should see this place at night.

49:43.166 --> 49:44.083
You'd love it.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.375
Are you staying tonight?

49:49.750 --> 49:51.500
I'm getting married soon, Giorgio.

49:53.208 --> 49:54.041
Married?

49:55.541 --> 49:56.666
Come on!

49:56.750 --> 49:58.666
You don't want to get married.

49:59.208 --> 50:02.625
You belong in this world
more than anyone else.

50:04.416 --> 50:07.166
I'm not sure this qualifies
as a world, Giorgio.

50:08.750 --> 50:11.291
It's more like a disco, a beach club.

50:12.250 --> 50:14.791
It's not a disco.
It's an independent state.

50:15.416 --> 50:16.291
Free.

50:17.208 --> 50:18.916
We even have drinking water.

50:19.666 --> 50:21.583
-We have an official language.
-Sure.

50:21.666 --> 50:25.000
But I see people dancing, drinking,
a cute girl bartender,

50:25.083 --> 50:27.083
and it looks like a disco. That's all.

50:28.041 --> 50:29.708
With the name in Esperanto.

50:30.625 --> 50:32.541
It looks like that to you.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.875
Right. Giorgio, I'm sorry but…

50:37.958 --> 50:38.916
I have to go.

50:40.333 --> 50:41.166
Take care.

50:50.750 --> 50:55.000
Do you know how hard it is
to bring all these people out here?

50:55.083 --> 50:56.333
No, and you know why?

50:56.416 --> 50:59.083
Because it isn't hard
to bring people here!

50:59.166 --> 51:01.583
The hard part was building this island!

51:01.666 --> 51:04.583
And while we were building it,
you were cleaning toilets.

51:04.666 --> 51:06.291
I was the promoter there,

51:06.375 --> 51:10.791
and I quit because two kids
built a house on stilts in the sea

51:10.875 --> 51:13.666
and didn't know what to do with it.
I turned it into a dream place!

51:13.791 --> 51:16.000
It was our dream, not yours!
Don't forget that.

51:16.083 --> 51:19.250
I won't let you turn this place
into an illegal gambling den.

51:19.333 --> 51:22.750
There's nothing illegal on this island.
You need to understand that!

51:22.833 --> 51:26.083
Water-skiing is for rich people.
You can do it anywhere.

51:26.166 --> 51:28.583
But poker's something
you can only do here.

51:28.666 --> 51:31.625
-Because it's a crime in the real world!
-Correct! But not here.

51:31.708 --> 51:33.375
That's why we built an island.

51:33.458 --> 51:36.750
-Giorgio, back me up here.
-We built a disco.

51:37.833 --> 51:38.833
We did what?

51:38.916 --> 51:43.375
We built our little, free world,
on our happy island…

51:43.458 --> 51:45.750
But what's all this for,

51:45.833 --> 51:49.291
if they don't recognize us
as an independent state?

51:49.375 --> 51:50.958
Who's "they"?

51:52.041 --> 51:54.958
Italy, Europe, the other states. Who else?

51:55.041 --> 51:58.833
I disagree with that.
Who cares if they recognize us or not?

51:58.916 --> 52:02.041
If we wanted a state,
we'd have rules, and we don't want that.

52:02.125 --> 52:03.416
If they don't recognize us,

52:03.500 --> 52:05.916
we'll just be a disco
in the middle of the sea.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.458
We already have everything.
We have currency, we have stamps,

52:09.541 --> 52:10.875
we have a postal service.

52:10.958 --> 52:12.333
The only thing missing…

52:13.500 --> 52:14.708
is a government.

52:15.250 --> 52:17.041
But we are the government.

52:18.208 --> 52:19.541
I'll be the president.

52:20.083 --> 52:22.208
Franca, the minister for economic affairs.

52:22.291 --> 52:24.166
Pietro, surveillance and defense.

52:24.250 --> 52:26.041
What's a surveillance ministry?

52:26.125 --> 52:28.750
I said "surveillance and defense"
for a reason.

52:28.833 --> 52:31.583
You're the caretaker,
you oversee rather than defend.

52:32.208 --> 52:34.541
Rudy, secretary of state,
Maurizio, internal affairs.

52:34.625 --> 52:38.458
-I'm not sure that's a good idea.
-Maurizio's right. It'll piss them off.

52:38.541 --> 52:39.375
So what?

52:39.916 --> 52:41.375
I feel like a minister.

52:42.291 --> 52:45.666
I wonder how my folks will react.
I usually give them bad news.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.083
How exactly are we doing this?

53:21.958 --> 53:25.833
UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS

54:51.416 --> 54:56.500
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS

54:56.583 --> 54:59.333
<i>The idea is to increase</i>
<i>and strategically relocate</i>

54:59.416 --> 55:01.958
<i>the military trucks in key spots</i>

55:02.041 --> 55:04.750
to send out a strong message.

55:04.833 --> 55:08.250
Using the summertime to regain control
over the occupied universities.

55:08.833 --> 55:10.250
Basically all of them, except one.

55:10.333 --> 55:12.375
Only one left? Which one?

55:12.458 --> 55:13.583
Luigi,

55:13.666 --> 55:15.208
the military trucks again?

55:15.291 --> 55:18.333
I know, Giovanni, but if you've noticed,

55:18.416 --> 55:22.083
the students who went to lessons
and respected the teachers six months ago,

55:22.166 --> 55:25.291
have suddenly turned into a mob
driven by hatred and violence.

55:25.375 --> 55:28.583
Clearly, pollution is to blame,

55:28.666 --> 55:32.000
excessive protein intake, and TV.

55:32.583 --> 55:36.500
I happened to watch TV last night,
and it was all about dismemberment,

55:36.583 --> 55:38.500
monsters, people copulating.

55:38.583 --> 55:41.208
All this on the main channel.
Is that acceptable?

55:41.291 --> 55:43.083
You must have watched <i>The Odyssey.</i>

55:43.166 --> 55:44.708
<i>The Odyssey?</i>

55:44.791 --> 55:46.958
Maybe. I fell asleep halfway through.

55:47.041 --> 55:48.625
Okay, then…

55:49.125 --> 55:50.791
let's go ahead with the outposts.

55:50.875 --> 55:54.250
If there are no other urgent matters,
we'll update on Thursday.

55:54.875 --> 55:55.791
Thank you.

55:59.250 --> 56:03.125
Actually, Giovanni,
talking about young people,

56:03.708 --> 56:05.166
there is one thing…

56:05.750 --> 56:08.500
Forget it, we'll talk about it next time.
Don't worry.

56:08.583 --> 56:09.583
Tell me, Franco.

56:09.666 --> 56:14.041
We'll talk about it next time.
Don't worry, it's not important.

56:14.125 --> 56:17.458
Even better.
Just tell us and we can go for lunch.

56:18.666 --> 56:19.875
It's nothing…

56:20.375 --> 56:21.958
Basically, what's happening is…

56:22.750 --> 56:27.166
there's this guy,
with some friends in Rimini.

56:28.083 --> 56:29.083
It's nothing really…

56:29.750 --> 56:33.083
Five hundred meters
outside of territorial waters,

56:33.833 --> 56:36.166
so just off Rimini.

56:36.250 --> 56:37.458
What did he do?

56:37.541 --> 56:39.666
He built an island,

56:39.750 --> 56:42.083
and declared independence.

56:45.833 --> 56:47.208
I didn't get that. Say it again.

56:47.291 --> 56:49.916
It's nothing, Giovanni,
it's no big deal. I told you.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.916
In fact, while telling you
and hearing myself saying it,

56:53.000 --> 56:54.708
I actually realized

56:54.791 --> 56:57.875
that it sounds more serious
than it really is.

56:57.958 --> 57:02.500
Some guys in Rimini,
500 meters outside territorial waters,

57:02.583 --> 57:06.291
built an island and declared independence.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.958
Independence from whom?

57:19.041 --> 57:22.875
From Italy, I believe. From everyone.
They're independent…

57:23.875 --> 57:28.625
An island, though from what I gather,
it's more like a platform.

57:28.708 --> 57:29.958
"From what I gather"?

57:30.041 --> 57:34.000
Giovanni, please,
let's not make a drama out of nothing.

57:34.083 --> 57:36.791
-And how did they build this platform?
-I don't know.

57:36.875 --> 57:38.541
-And how long did it take?
-Giovanni--

57:38.625 --> 57:40.750
-How long did it take?
-I don't know.

57:40.833 --> 57:44.666
An adequate amount of time
necessary to build something like that.

57:44.750 --> 57:46.958
Why are we just finding out about it?

57:47.041 --> 57:49.291
Maybe because the local authority,

57:49.375 --> 57:52.208
considering it's outside
territorial waters,

57:52.291 --> 57:54.791
might have believed it wasn't their--

57:54.875 --> 57:55.750
I'm sorry,

57:56.416 --> 57:57.708
but how did <i>you</i> find out?

57:58.375 --> 58:01.166
Well… this maybe is the only detail

58:01.250 --> 58:06.000
that makes this seemingly
insignificant event, a little more serious

58:06.083 --> 58:08.250
because basically, we were told by…

58:10.750 --> 58:12.500
Well, the UN called us.

58:15.708 --> 58:18.583
-The UN called us?
-That's why I didn't want to tell you.

58:18.666 --> 58:23.000
Giovanni, we're making a big fuss,
that's what we're doing, about a prank--

58:23.083 --> 58:27.458
I'm sorry, Franco, the UN called us,
and you say it's a prank!

58:27.541 --> 58:29.625
Who's our man at the UN? Who's there?

58:29.708 --> 58:30.541
Randelli.

58:30.625 --> 58:31.791
Randelli died last year!

58:31.875 --> 58:34.291
What's the name of the officer
who called you?

58:34.375 --> 58:36.750
I don't think it was an officer, Giovanni.

58:36.833 --> 58:38.416
Good. Maybe it was a secretary.

58:38.500 --> 58:41.125
Secretary, yes, I mean…

58:41.208 --> 58:44.125
not <i>a</i> secretary but the…

58:44.208 --> 58:46.833
Secretary-General of the United Nations.

58:49.416 --> 58:50.500
When did this happen?

58:50.583 --> 58:51.750
Two days ago.

58:51.833 --> 58:53.541
What the hell have you been doing
for two days?

58:53.625 --> 58:56.958
I immediately sent out
two of our best intelligence officers.

58:57.041 --> 58:58.750
Good. Where's their report?

59:00.750 --> 59:02.666
We haven't heard from them…

59:03.500 --> 59:04.791
for nearly 40 hours.

59:05.583 --> 59:06.833
By law, in eight hours' time

59:06.916 --> 59:09.583
we have to notify the families
by telegram.

59:18.208 --> 59:20.666
Good morning, gentlemen. So…

59:22.250 --> 59:25.125
-Tell me you found them.
-They're on the phone.

59:25.208 --> 59:27.666
-They're alive then.
-Yes, I'd say so.

59:27.750 --> 59:30.208
They'll regret they are.

59:32.041 --> 59:38.916
Agent, I hope you have a valid explanation
for your disgraceful behavior.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.333
-I cheated on my wife!
<i>-Agent, pull yourself together.</i>

59:42.416 --> 59:44.416
The situation's taken a bad turn.

59:44.500 --> 59:47.625
<i>Please, don't tell her.</i>
<i>I love her so much!</i>

59:47.708 --> 59:50.458
-Wait!
-Minister, Agent Piazza here.

59:50.541 --> 59:56.000
The island's inhabitants' top priority
is the custom of adding fruit to wine,

59:56.083 --> 59:57.375
<i>then drinking the wine…</i>

59:57.458 --> 1:00:01.833
Agent Piazza, it's called sangria.
In Spain, they've been doing it for ages.

1:00:01.916 --> 1:00:03.916
Agent Piazza, I'm fairly sure

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:07.750
that you're talking to
an Italian minister while drunk!

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:09.458
It's the minister.

1:00:09.541 --> 1:00:12.666
<i>Return to Rome immediately</i>
<i>with a detailed report.</i>

1:00:12.750 --> 1:00:17.708
Or you will have to face a court-martial
with accusations of high treason.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:33.500
<i>After foreign affairs, onto lifestyle.</i>

1:00:33.583 --> 1:00:37.458
<i>Or rather, we're still on foreign affairs</i>
<i>but we'll focus on the "life in style."</i>

1:00:37.541 --> 1:00:41.958
<i>That fun play on words</i>
<i>is the perfect introduction</i>

1:00:42.041 --> 1:00:46.666
<i>to what seems to have become</i>
<i>the main attraction on Rimini's shores,</i>

1:00:46.750 --> 1:00:48.208
<i>Rose Island.</i>

1:00:49.125 --> 1:00:54.541
<i>The founder, Giorgio Rosa,</i>
<i>talks about utopia and freedom.</i>

1:00:54.625 --> 1:00:57.708
<i>But what is being hidden on the island?</i>

1:00:57.791 --> 1:00:58.875
<i>Drugs?</i>

1:00:58.958 --> 1:01:00.666
<i>Moral degeneration?</i>

1:01:00.750 --> 1:01:02.041
<i>Gambling?</i>

1:01:02.625 --> 1:01:05.916
<i>We talk to Franco Restivo,</i>
<i>Minister of Internal Affairs.</i>

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:10.250
<i>This so-called Rose Island,</i>

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:16.500
<i>absolutely cannot and should not</i>
<i>be considered as an independent state.</i>

1:01:16.583 --> 1:01:18.833
<i>Is it true that the UN</i>
<i>has started an investigation</i>

1:01:18.916 --> 1:01:22.000
<i>on the basis that there might be grounds</i>
<i>for a claim for independence?</i>

1:01:22.083 --> 1:01:26.250
<i>No. That investigation</i>
<i>does not concern us.</i>

1:01:26.333 --> 1:01:32.583
<i>The Italian State will absolutely</i>
<i>not tolerate a lawless platform</i>

1:01:32.666 --> 1:01:36.291
<i>where the safety of our citizens</i>
<i>cannot be guaranteed.</i>

1:01:36.375 --> 1:01:40.083
<i>They may be in international waters,</i>
<i>but they are Italian citizens,</i>

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:43.583
<i>and their safety is our main concern.</i>

1:01:48.291 --> 1:01:49.125
What's this?

1:01:49.208 --> 1:01:51.458
Letters. Applications for citizenship.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:54.875
The minister has unwillingly
put us on the map.

1:01:54.958 --> 1:01:56.916
The requests come from all over the world!

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.625
Now everyone knows who we are.

1:01:58.708 --> 1:02:01.291
And they want to become citizens
of Rose Island.

1:02:11.708 --> 1:02:14.541
-God bless the president!
-Come on, get up.

1:02:14.625 --> 1:02:16.333
-You're amazing!
-Thanks.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.666
So how's it going?

1:02:21.041 --> 1:02:22.375
Sorry I'm late.

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:23.958
President?

1:02:24.458 --> 1:02:27.750
Yes, Dad, but they're hippies.
They're over the top.

1:02:29.041 --> 1:02:31.458
-Have you ordered yet?
-We were waiting for you.

1:02:31.541 --> 1:02:33.208
Okay, here I am. Waiter!

1:02:34.250 --> 1:02:35.791
What's fresh today?

1:02:36.625 --> 1:02:38.250
Our usual catch of the day,

1:02:38.333 --> 1:02:41.083
and a fantastic lobster
that can be served a number of ways.

1:02:41.166 --> 1:02:43.666
Great! Lobster for everybody?

1:02:43.750 --> 1:02:45.750
Half a portion of tagliolini.

1:02:47.708 --> 1:02:50.458
Half a portion of tagliolini? Dad?

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:52.625
Yes, half a portion of tagliolini.

1:02:53.416 --> 1:02:56.000
Don't worry about money, you're my guests.

1:02:56.083 --> 1:02:58.416
-Half a portion--
-He'd like half a portion of tagliolini.

1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.750
So two lobsters
and half a portion of tagliolini.

1:03:01.833 --> 1:03:04.166
Good. Thank you.

1:03:04.833 --> 1:03:07.708
-Thanks. You look good, Mom.
-Thanks.

1:03:07.791 --> 1:03:08.875
Is it legal, Giorgio?

1:03:10.291 --> 1:03:12.375
The money you're earning, is it legal?

1:03:13.083 --> 1:03:14.833
What do you mean legal?

1:03:16.041 --> 1:03:19.916
We're an independent state,
close to being recognized by the UN,

1:03:20.916 --> 1:03:22.583
we get to decide what is legal.

1:03:22.666 --> 1:03:24.833
Nobody gets to say
what is legal for themselves.

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:26.875
Dad, we're doing nothing wrong.

1:03:26.958 --> 1:03:29.916
Don't believe the newspapers.

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.583
Why don't you come after lunch?

1:03:32.666 --> 1:03:34.500
It's just 20 minutes by boat.

1:03:34.583 --> 1:03:37.125
We can go together,
and you can see what we do.

1:03:38.416 --> 1:03:42.708
Did I tell you I patented
a telescopic pillar system to build it?

1:03:43.333 --> 1:03:44.416
You'd love it.

1:03:45.583 --> 1:03:46.750
Are you coming?

1:03:48.708 --> 1:03:51.166
Your mom has a nap after lunch,
we'd better not.

1:04:00.750 --> 1:04:01.583
Okay.

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:03.583
Maybe another time.

1:04:28.625 --> 1:04:29.875
Aren't your folks coming?

1:04:31.333 --> 1:04:33.333
My mom needs a rest after lunch.

1:04:33.958 --> 1:04:35.458
Don't take it personally.

1:04:35.958 --> 1:04:38.416
It's hard for them to understand
what we're doing.

1:04:42.708 --> 1:04:44.583
Mr. Rosa, right?

1:04:44.666 --> 1:04:47.041
We're about to leave. We're in a hurry.

1:04:47.125 --> 1:04:47.958
Yes, that's me.

1:04:48.041 --> 1:04:51.166
You need to talk to
our foreign relations representative.

1:04:51.250 --> 1:04:52.916
Mr. Rosa, we need to talk to you.

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.125
-I was just saying that you need to--
-That's okay.

1:04:57.833 --> 1:04:58.958
Let's go.

1:04:59.041 --> 1:05:01.041
Meet me at the boat. I'll be right back.

1:05:03.583 --> 1:05:05.625
<i>Mr. Rosa, do you know who we are?</i>

1:05:06.833 --> 1:05:09.208
-Funeral service?
-We're from the Secret Service.

1:05:09.291 --> 1:05:11.250
I know. It was a joke.

1:05:12.916 --> 1:05:14.208
Haven't we met before?

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:17.041
I've spent about 40 hours on the island.

1:05:17.125 --> 1:05:19.375
I remember,
you're the one who lost his pinkie.

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:20.916
Not really.

1:05:21.416 --> 1:05:24.291
I didn't actually bet my pinkie.

1:05:24.375 --> 1:05:27.208
It was a memorable game!

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:31.166
You must immediately cease
all activities on the island.

1:05:32.083 --> 1:05:33.125
Which activities?

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:37.583
Our report suggests
that you have a bar managed by a minor,

1:05:37.666 --> 1:05:39.541
and you host card games.

1:05:40.083 --> 1:05:41.041
So what?

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:44.375
Aren't those men
playing cards in a bar too?

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:46.000
Why can't we do it?

1:05:46.083 --> 1:05:50.166
It's different what happens here
under the watchful eye of the authorities.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:53.083
Oh, I see! It's about "the watchful eye."

1:05:53.166 --> 1:05:56.250
Listen, Giorgio,
what the major is trying to say

1:05:56.333 --> 1:05:59.166
is that we appreciate
your sociological experiment,

1:05:59.250 --> 1:06:01.625
but as with all experiments,
it must end now.

1:06:02.250 --> 1:06:03.416
What must end?

1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:06.500
Beach clubs permits are being renewed
at the end of the month.

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:08.666
And the major here has power of attorney.

1:06:09.250 --> 1:06:10.583
See this briefcase?

1:06:10.666 --> 1:06:13.541
It contains papers
which guarantee that you,

1:06:13.625 --> 1:06:16.125
who's sitting here owning nothing,

1:06:16.208 --> 1:06:18.750
end up with two beach clubs
of your choice.

1:06:19.791 --> 1:06:23.250
It'd set you up
for the next three generations.

1:06:23.333 --> 1:06:26.416
You said it yourself,
you do the same things there,

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.041
bar, card games…
You just do it here and not on the sea.

1:06:29.125 --> 1:06:30.458
What's the difference?

1:06:30.541 --> 1:06:33.833
None, except for the permits
we'll give you.

1:06:33.916 --> 1:06:36.791
You might say,
"I don't pay goddamn taxes there."

1:06:36.875 --> 1:06:40.125
Do you think anyone does here?
Come on, Giorgio.

1:06:48.541 --> 1:06:50.208
What the hell…

1:06:52.250 --> 1:06:54.166
This is serious, you know!

1:06:56.041 --> 1:06:58.666
I'm trying to save your goddamn island!

1:07:00.625 --> 1:07:03.250
Attention, please, everyone.

1:07:03.333 --> 1:07:05.416
Mr. President, may I say it?

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:06.583
As you wish.

1:07:06.666 --> 1:07:10.125
Okay. As you know, tonight,
we kept the island to ourselves

1:07:10.208 --> 1:07:12.083
for a special Council of Ministers,

1:07:12.166 --> 1:07:14.583
as special as the news
I'm about to give you.

1:07:14.666 --> 1:07:19.166
Our President, Giorgio Rosa,
has finally agreed,

1:07:19.250 --> 1:07:22.708
that from tomorrow the island
will officially be able to grant

1:07:22.791 --> 1:07:24.916
citizenship to all applicants.

1:07:25.625 --> 1:07:28.625
What are you clapping for?
That wasn't the news. Stop!

1:07:28.708 --> 1:07:32.583
That wasn't the news,
just an official communication.

1:07:32.666 --> 1:07:37.958
The real news is
that we have printed the first passport,

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:40.791
and we have agreed to assign it

1:07:40.875 --> 1:07:43.541
to the one among us
who has never owned one. So…

1:07:44.375 --> 1:07:46.500
Rudy, this is for you.

1:07:48.250 --> 1:07:51.208
Now, this calls for a round of applause.
Come on, guys!

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:54.500
-Well done, Neumann!
-GIve me a hug.

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:07.250
We're hoping that
with the increased military presence,

1:08:07.333 --> 1:08:08.833
things will settle.

1:08:08.916 --> 1:08:11.208
We're hoping
to regain control of the universities,

1:08:11.291 --> 1:08:13.125
since there's only one left.

1:08:13.208 --> 1:08:15.666
I know. These are hard times.

1:08:15.750 --> 1:08:19.166
But you shouldn't worry,
you're doing a great job,

1:08:19.750 --> 1:08:23.083
and we're all very happy here.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:24.583
Thank you, Emanuele.

1:08:24.666 --> 1:08:26.041
Well, Giovanni,

1:08:26.125 --> 1:08:29.541
I'll see you again in two weeks, as usual.

1:08:29.625 --> 1:08:32.541
-Sure.
-Try to rest a little.

1:08:32.625 --> 1:08:35.583
You're looking a little gray.

1:08:35.666 --> 1:08:38.000
I could really do with a vacation.

1:08:41.583 --> 1:08:42.625
Don't forget this.

1:08:43.541 --> 1:08:44.791
Excuse me, Giovanni,

1:08:44.875 --> 1:08:48.500
since you're here,
there's something I'd like to mention.

1:08:48.583 --> 1:08:53.791
Especially considering the exposure
that it's getting in the tabloids.

1:08:53.875 --> 1:08:56.125
ROSE ISLAND
A SMALL STATE OFF RIMINI

1:08:56.833 --> 1:08:58.916
Look, Emanuele, we're working on it.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.916
I'm sure you are, but times have changed.

1:09:02.500 --> 1:09:05.958
I used to be able to filter the news,

1:09:06.041 --> 1:09:09.916
but now our Holy Father
wants to be informed first-hand.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.958
He reads all the papers
first thing in the morning.

1:09:13.041 --> 1:09:18.000
I caught this one
and removed it from the stack,

1:09:18.500 --> 1:09:21.166
but had he seen this,
it would've gotten ugly.

1:09:21.250 --> 1:09:22.583
Giovanni,

1:09:23.458 --> 1:09:24.625
this is a bare ass.

1:09:25.416 --> 1:09:27.916
Do you get it, Giovanni,
an ass in the newspaper.

1:09:28.541 --> 1:09:30.958
You tell me if you think this is okay.

1:09:31.041 --> 1:09:34.291
Of course not, but my dear Emanuele,

1:09:34.375 --> 1:09:37.500
we don't really want
to start a case about an ass.

1:09:37.583 --> 1:09:39.000
It's not about the ass itself,

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:43.916
which I think is well-proportioned, nice,
but what the ass represents.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.916
An ass on an island where,
from what I gather,

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:49.916
you can do what you want.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.916
Do you get it, Giovanni?
An ass and everything you want.

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:55.916
Giovanni,

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.041
with an ass, can you do anything you want?

1:10:02.708 --> 1:10:05.333
No. I'll tell you. You can't.

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:09.041
Otherwise, this country
would be out of our control.

1:10:09.666 --> 1:10:10.500
Sure.

1:10:13.708 --> 1:10:17.375
The truth is,
they're outside our territorial waters.

1:10:17.458 --> 1:10:21.666
-So outside of our jurisdiction.
-Like I said, it's just a small issue.

1:10:50.416 --> 1:10:51.500
Where's Franco?

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:56.708
What the hell are these?

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:03.541
My dear Giovanni, I wasn't expecting you.

1:11:03.625 --> 1:11:06.041
Had you told me,
we could have met at the cafe.

1:11:06.125 --> 1:11:08.458
It's so messy here.

1:11:08.541 --> 1:11:10.500
-What the hell are these letters?
-Nothing…

1:11:10.583 --> 1:11:13.333
Requests to relinquish
Italian nationality, Mr. President,

1:11:13.416 --> 1:11:15.083
in favor of Rose Island.

1:11:15.166 --> 1:11:18.958
No, not really.
I mean, it doesn't work like that.

1:11:19.041 --> 1:11:21.416
They can't just write in
and we cancel their citizenship.

1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:24.666
It's not a subscription to
<i>Famiglia Cristiana </i>that you just cancel.

1:11:24.750 --> 1:11:27.916
And most of the letters
are written in such poor Italian!

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:29.750
-Don't waste--
-How many are there?

1:11:29.833 --> 1:11:34.041
About 300. The German Consulate called,
and they've received about 100,

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:36.125
France 30, and the US four.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:39.583
Just four in the States, Giovanni.
They don't give a damn about them.

1:11:39.666 --> 1:11:40.958
They flopped over there.

1:11:41.041 --> 1:11:44.791
Franco, I've had enough of this shit.

1:11:44.875 --> 1:11:50.583
The letters, parliamentary interrogations,
asses that can't do what they want.

1:11:50.666 --> 1:11:53.250
-Asses what?
-You have to fix this now.

1:11:53.333 --> 1:11:56.416
Even if you have to swim there
with a screwdriver between your teeth

1:11:56.500 --> 1:12:01.250
to unscrew that goddamn platform
bit by bit!

1:12:01.333 --> 1:12:04.000
Franco, we've known
each other for 30 years,

1:12:04.083 --> 1:12:06.916
but you've never seen me truly pissed off.

1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:09.958
Tell me you understand.

1:12:10.791 --> 1:12:12.666
I understand, Giovanni. I do.

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:27.833
Rosa!

1:12:29.416 --> 1:12:30.416
Rosa!

1:12:32.166 --> 1:12:33.458
It's Battistini.

1:12:34.125 --> 1:12:35.541
He wants to talk to you.

1:13:13.375 --> 1:13:16.041
Nothing. It's going to rain tomorrow too.

1:13:16.125 --> 1:13:21.291
We have to start building the roof
for the second floor as soon as we can.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:24.125
And then we have to extend the canopy.

1:13:24.916 --> 1:13:26.541
Giorgio, are you listening?

1:13:26.625 --> 1:13:28.125
Did you think about heating?

1:13:28.208 --> 1:13:30.875
It's important.
We'll freeze to death in a month.

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:32.541
We have to find a solution.

1:13:32.625 --> 1:13:34.875
Rudy… What do you think?

1:13:34.958 --> 1:13:37.416
Well… I don't know, guys.

1:13:37.916 --> 1:13:39.583
An island is a summer place.

1:13:39.666 --> 1:13:42.875
In my experience,
it's hard to attract guests in the autumn.

1:13:42.958 --> 1:13:46.583
What do you mean it's hard?
This is an independent state.

1:13:46.666 --> 1:13:49.791
We can't shut down for the season.
We have citizens now.

1:13:49.875 --> 1:13:51.791
What about you, Franca? What do you think?

1:13:51.875 --> 1:13:55.333
I'm almost six months pregnant.
I don't know how much longer I can stay.

1:13:55.416 --> 1:13:59.250
We've been talking about
our first natural-born citizen for months!

1:13:59.333 --> 1:14:02.541
The midwife said she won't come.
She says it's too dangerous.

1:14:02.625 --> 1:14:05.416
She can't be bothered, more like.

1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:08.083
-Don't worry. I'll find someone else.
-You, Pietro?

1:14:08.958 --> 1:14:10.250
What are your plans?

1:14:10.750 --> 1:14:13.375
Come on,
what kind of plans can Pietro have?

1:14:13.458 --> 1:14:14.291
Come on, guys.

1:14:14.375 --> 1:14:18.583
Let's try to be a bit positive.
Being negative doesn't help.

1:14:18.666 --> 1:14:19.708
What did they offer you?

1:14:19.791 --> 1:14:20.791
So the roof--

1:14:23.166 --> 1:14:24.333
What did you say?

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:27.125
What did they offer you?

1:14:37.833 --> 1:14:39.083
Wait a minute,

1:14:39.166 --> 1:14:41.666
am I the only one
who wasn't offered anything?

1:14:41.750 --> 1:14:44.625
-Enough, Maurizio.
-What do you mean "Enough, Maurizio"?

1:14:44.708 --> 1:14:49.083
You knew about this and didn't tell me?
What did they offer you?

1:14:49.166 --> 1:14:52.208
You're using the baby excuse,
but what did they offer you?

1:14:52.291 --> 1:14:56.000
You even had the guts to make up excuses.
What were you offered?

1:15:25.666 --> 1:15:27.458
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

1:15:44.875 --> 1:15:47.125
I've never watched daytime TV.

1:15:48.625 --> 1:15:49.916
I'm sorry, Dad.

1:15:50.541 --> 1:15:51.583
It's my fault.

1:15:53.041 --> 1:15:54.708
I didn't think they'd go this far.

1:15:59.291 --> 1:16:00.708
What did they offer you?

1:16:04.750 --> 1:16:05.666
Two beach clubs…

1:16:07.583 --> 1:16:08.958
of my choosing.

1:16:10.291 --> 1:16:11.333
Two beach clubs.

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:17.875
We made all those sacrifices
to pay for your education…

1:16:19.833 --> 1:16:22.208
and now you're going to be
a beach club manager.

1:16:25.833 --> 1:16:29.666
There's always a time
when you have to say yes.

1:16:30.416 --> 1:16:31.291
Isn't there?

1:16:32.541 --> 1:16:33.750
That's what you say.

1:16:39.958 --> 1:16:44.500
They said my performance was below
the standard expected by the company.

1:16:46.833 --> 1:16:48.833
I've never taken an extra day off,

1:16:49.666 --> 1:16:51.791
and I haven't called in sick
in five years.

1:16:53.166 --> 1:16:56.583
I've always done what I was asked to do.

1:17:02.333 --> 1:17:03.416
Say no, Giorgio.

1:17:06.083 --> 1:17:07.416
Say no this time too.

1:17:35.166 --> 1:17:38.416
Excuse me. I'm really sorry.

1:17:39.708 --> 1:17:42.083
Excuse me. I beg your pardon.

1:17:42.458 --> 1:17:45.166
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1:17:47.166 --> 1:17:48.375
Could you move over?

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:52.083
Could you move over?
It's urgent. I have to… Sorry.

1:17:52.958 --> 1:17:54.041
I'm really sorry.

1:17:55.541 --> 1:17:56.958
Thank you. Sorry.

1:17:57.541 --> 1:17:59.416
I'm really sorry. Thank you.

1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:00.916
What are you doing here?

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.041
I've been looking for you. Where were you?

1:18:03.125 --> 1:18:05.375
Do you know Carlo,
the man I'm about to marry?

1:18:05.458 --> 1:18:08.250
Carlo! Nice to meet you. I'm Giorgio.

1:18:08.333 --> 1:18:10.375
Gabriella's told me all about you.

1:18:10.458 --> 1:18:11.666
Carlo. Nice to meet you.

1:18:12.458 --> 1:18:14.583
-What's up, sweetheart?
-Nothing, don't worry.

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:18.125
Listen, it's not a disco.

1:18:18.208 --> 1:18:21.208
It's not a disco at all.
It's a real state, a free one.

1:18:21.291 --> 1:18:23.291
So real that they're now attacking us.

1:18:23.375 --> 1:18:26.000
So now you have to fight my case.

1:18:26.083 --> 1:18:28.708
Okay. Sorry, honey. I'll be right back.

1:18:29.291 --> 1:18:30.125
Let's go.

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.541
-I'm sorry, it's an urgent matter.
-Excuse us, please. Sorry.

1:18:37.916 --> 1:18:40.833
You shouldn't have written to the UN.
You pissed them off.

1:18:40.916 --> 1:18:44.125
I wanted to prove
that we are a free and independent state.

1:18:44.208 --> 1:18:45.750
Yes, you're free geographically,

1:18:45.833 --> 1:18:49.166
but an Italian citizen remains so
even outside territorial waters.

1:18:49.250 --> 1:18:51.291
Not if they choose otherwise.

1:18:51.833 --> 1:18:53.958
That's why we started issuing passports.

1:18:54.041 --> 1:18:55.666
That's exactly the point.

1:18:55.750 --> 1:18:58.708
You could be right
but they'd never admit it

1:18:58.791 --> 1:19:00.583
as it could set a dangerous precedent.

1:19:00.666 --> 1:19:02.958
So? Who can help me?

1:19:03.541 --> 1:19:05.083
I don't know, maybe a priest.

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:09.083
Come on! There must be someone,
a judge, an agency, I don't know.

1:19:09.166 --> 1:19:11.916
A bloody King Solomon
who deals with cases like these!

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.208
The Council of Europe in Strasbourg
handles disputes between states.

1:19:15.291 --> 1:19:18.125
Perfect, let's go then.

1:19:18.208 --> 1:19:19.125
Where?

1:19:19.208 --> 1:19:20.208
To Strasbourg!

1:19:20.291 --> 1:19:23.833
Giorgio, private citizens
cannot go to the Council of Europe.

1:19:23.916 --> 1:19:27.250
But I have a state,
and I'm going with my lawyer, you.

1:19:27.333 --> 1:19:29.791
International law is your field.

1:19:31.041 --> 1:19:33.500
I'm offering you
the adventure of a lifetime.

1:19:33.583 --> 1:19:36.041
To save an independent state.

1:19:37.166 --> 1:19:38.000
Will you come?

1:19:40.291 --> 1:19:41.166
Giorgio…

1:19:51.083 --> 1:19:52.000
Fine.

1:20:09.791 --> 1:20:13.083
IMPOUNDED VEHICLE

1:21:01.750 --> 1:21:02.625
<i>And so…</i>

1:21:03.250 --> 1:21:04.083
<i>I ended up here.</i>

1:21:05.041 --> 1:21:07.041
"And so I ended up here."

1:21:16.666 --> 1:21:18.125
Is that all?

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:21.000
Yes.

1:21:26.291 --> 1:21:27.166
Thank you.

1:21:53.041 --> 1:21:57.541
Major, accept my congratulations
on behalf of the Italian people.

1:21:57.625 --> 1:21:59.333
It wasn't an easy task.

1:21:59.416 --> 1:22:01.166
Thank you, Minister.

1:22:01.250 --> 1:22:03.625
How much did it cost us?

1:22:04.291 --> 1:22:06.000
They're four poor souls, sir.

1:22:06.083 --> 1:22:09.250
We got away with a bar,
one club permit, one passport,

1:22:09.333 --> 1:22:11.041
and a sailing boat.

1:22:11.125 --> 1:22:13.833
And what about what's his name, Orlandi?

1:22:14.625 --> 1:22:16.291
Maurizio Orlandi.

1:22:16.375 --> 1:22:21.041
He's an alcoholic. All he does is drink.
It's pointless talking to people like him.

1:22:21.125 --> 1:22:22.958
Well done, Major.

1:22:31.791 --> 1:22:33.333
Why are you whispering?

1:22:33.416 --> 1:22:34.916
To avoid bothering you, sir.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:38.166
Whispering bothers me.
What did you tell him?

1:22:38.250 --> 1:22:40.208
Nothing important, Minister.

1:22:41.458 --> 1:22:45.208
No… I don't like the face you pulled.
What did he tell you?

1:22:48.625 --> 1:22:49.791
Giorgio Rosa…

1:22:50.416 --> 1:22:52.000
is at the Council of Europe.

1:23:00.958 --> 1:23:02.666
It doesn't mean anything, sir.

1:23:02.750 --> 1:23:05.583
He's just sightseeing.
They don't see private citizens.

1:23:05.666 --> 1:23:10.541
The Council of Europe decided to see him
after he spent a week in the lobby.

1:23:10.625 --> 1:23:15.666
They called an emergency meeting,
and Giorgio Rosa gave his version.

1:23:19.791 --> 1:23:20.708
Fine.

1:23:34.791 --> 1:23:37.291
It's incredible.
I don't know how you did it.

1:23:37.375 --> 1:23:39.791
You told an incredible story.

1:23:39.875 --> 1:23:44.041
Whatever the outcome,
this will go down in history.

1:23:44.125 --> 1:23:48.125
You have no idea
what is about to happen here today.

1:23:48.208 --> 1:23:49.083
Translate.

1:23:49.166 --> 1:23:53.791
They will start a dossier on it,
and they will review the case. Go on.

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:57.000
Basically, the Council of Europe
will deliberate on your island.

1:23:57.083 --> 1:23:58.000
It went well?

1:23:58.083 --> 1:24:00.750
Can someone please answer the phone?

1:24:01.375 --> 1:24:05.458
So, Giorgio,
you should not let your guard down.

1:24:06.041 --> 1:24:08.166
Maybe we should talk
to some legal experts.

1:24:08.250 --> 1:24:10.625
Can someone answer the phone?

1:24:12.750 --> 1:24:13.583
Hello?

1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:17.333
Yes.

1:24:24.083 --> 1:24:25.000
Mr. Tomà.

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:26.500
It's urgent.

1:24:26.583 --> 1:24:28.791
Not now, get a message. I'll call back.

1:24:29.416 --> 1:24:31.958
No… It's the Italian Minister
of Internal Affairs.

1:24:45.916 --> 1:24:47.333
It's not for you.

1:24:47.958 --> 1:24:50.916
He wants to talk to Mr. Rosa.

1:25:21.666 --> 1:25:22.708
Hello?

1:25:22.791 --> 1:25:24.541
<i>When I was a boy,</i>

1:25:25.041 --> 1:25:28.125
<i>I had one passion:</i>

1:25:28.208 --> 1:25:29.875
<i>cycling.</i>

1:25:29.958 --> 1:25:32.041
<i>I was able to perfectly combine</i>

1:25:32.125 --> 1:25:35.708
my political activity
with some decent results

1:25:35.791 --> 1:25:38.458
in some local cycling competitions.

1:25:39.208 --> 1:25:42.375
Then suddenly, I had to quit.

1:25:43.750 --> 1:25:48.250
<i>In 1947, I quit cycling for good,</i>

1:25:48.833 --> 1:25:50.416
<i>because</i>…

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:53.375
every God-given day,

1:25:53.958 --> 1:25:57.416
myself and some 551 poor idiots,

1:25:58.416 --> 1:26:00.041
had to write

1:26:00.708 --> 1:26:03.583
a list of numbered sentences,

1:26:04.375 --> 1:26:08.208
which would become
the foundation of this republic

1:26:08.291 --> 1:26:09.750
which was about to be born.

1:26:10.750 --> 1:26:13.000
You have to think of everything, you know.

1:26:13.083 --> 1:26:15.750
<i>Consider all variables.</i>

1:26:15.833 --> 1:26:18.708
<i>If you get one wrong, it all falls apart,</i>

1:26:18.791 --> 1:26:23.208
<i>and the freedom</i>
<i>we had fought so hard for, will vanish.</i>

1:26:25.125 --> 1:26:27.750
Reading those little sentences today,

1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:30.833
I believe we got our odds right.

1:26:32.125 --> 1:26:32.958
And you,

1:26:33.583 --> 1:26:38.916
you insignificant piece of shit,

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:43.333
<i>would like to be the exception</i>
<i>to that perfect calculation?</i>

1:26:43.416 --> 1:26:47.833
You talk about freedom,
but yours is a conditional freedom.

1:26:47.916 --> 1:26:50.125
Absolute freedom simply scares you.

1:26:50.208 --> 1:26:54.750
You don't hate me for what I've done,
but for what I could do.

1:26:55.333 --> 1:27:00.083
<i>I'm outside territorial waters.</i>
<i>It doesn't concern you.</i>

1:27:00.166 --> 1:27:03.083
You act like a big man,
but then you write to the UN,

1:27:03.166 --> 1:27:05.541
<i>and you go to the Council of Europe.</i>

1:27:05.625 --> 1:27:11.208
<i>I'd say you're not really an anarchist</i>
<i>if you need someone to acknowledge you.</i>

1:27:11.291 --> 1:27:14.916
You've built a 400-square-meter-platform

1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.541
with four idiots
and you think that's a state?

1:27:19.083 --> 1:27:23.041
But you haven't got the slightest idea
of what it takes

1:27:23.125 --> 1:27:25.750
to secure the freedom

1:27:25.833 --> 1:27:27.083
<i>of 40 million people.</i>

1:27:27.166 --> 1:27:30.250
I won't take lessons
from someone who had a man fired

1:27:30.333 --> 1:27:33.208
after 30 years just to intimidate me!

1:27:33.291 --> 1:27:36.083
Do yourself a favor, get away from there.

1:27:36.166 --> 1:27:38.083
Save yourself the humiliation.

1:27:38.166 --> 1:27:40.458
You're on your own,
and you haven't a hope.

1:27:40.541 --> 1:27:44.458
<i>The Council of Europe</i>
<i>has just agreed to examine my case,</i>

1:27:44.541 --> 1:27:47.666
<i>and the consultations</i>
<i>start tomorrow morning.</i>

1:27:47.750 --> 1:27:52.958
Stock up with lawyers, asshole,
because this story has just started.

1:27:53.041 --> 1:27:54.375
And you can't stop me.

1:27:54.458 --> 1:27:56.916
All right, dickhead.

1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.375
You founded a state? So did I.

1:27:59.458 --> 1:28:02.375
But do you know the difference
between our two states?

1:28:02.458 --> 1:28:06.916
I have an arsenal that can blow up
your shitty island to pieces!

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.375
<i>Run back to Rimini quickly,</i>

1:28:08.458 --> 1:28:12.250
or you'll miss
the best fireworks you'll ever see!

1:28:24.666 --> 1:28:26.333
I have to go back to Rimini.

1:28:27.458 --> 1:28:29.458
The Council will meet in two days.

1:28:29.541 --> 1:28:32.166
There might not be an island in two days!

1:29:06.208 --> 1:29:08.666
<i>Assault squad ready in 15 minutes.</i>

1:29:09.250 --> 1:29:11.083
<i>Instructions to follow.</i>

1:29:11.166 --> 1:29:15.375
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
<i>I repeat, this is not a drill.</i>

1:29:15.458 --> 1:29:20.291
<i>Assault squad ready in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

1:29:29.583 --> 1:29:32.458
Let's be honest,

1:29:32.541 --> 1:29:37.250
today's modern weddings always end
with a gift of "The Hunter" to the guests.

1:29:37.333 --> 1:29:39.208
The one you're holding

1:29:39.291 --> 1:29:42.291
is the crown jewel
of the '68-'69 collection,

1:29:42.375 --> 1:29:44.458
"The Hunter and his Bloodhounds."

1:29:44.541 --> 1:29:48.208
We also have the basic version
without the bloodhounds.

1:29:48.291 --> 1:29:50.125
Sure, it'll save you some money,

1:29:51.291 --> 1:29:53.625
but it's less elegant and symbolic.

1:29:53.708 --> 1:29:55.458
What shall we do, sweetheart?

1:30:11.625 --> 1:30:12.666
What's this?

1:30:12.750 --> 1:30:15.375
It's a replica of Rose Island in silver.

1:30:15.458 --> 1:30:18.416
Just a souvenir,
we sell lots of them to tourists.

1:30:19.166 --> 1:30:23.750
If you like it,
we also have it in wrought iron.

1:30:35.625 --> 1:30:36.833
Hello, Mom?

1:30:37.583 --> 1:30:38.500
Were you sleeping?

1:30:40.125 --> 1:30:43.083
Yes, sure. It's 11 p.m. I'm sorry.

1:30:43.750 --> 1:30:45.125
No, nothing.

1:30:45.750 --> 1:30:48.250
It was just to tell you I'm fine.

1:30:48.333 --> 1:30:51.083
I'm on the freeway.
I'm coming back to Rimini.

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:56.083
I've been to France.
Do you remember? For the island issue.

1:30:57.041 --> 1:30:59.250
It's actually going really well.

1:31:00.166 --> 1:31:02.250
Tomorrow they're going to meet to deci--

1:31:04.083 --> 1:31:05.333
Yes, Mom. I ate.

1:31:06.250 --> 1:31:08.333
Yes, I had a sandwich at the gas station.

1:31:09.750 --> 1:31:11.083
Yes, they make sandwiches.

1:31:11.958 --> 1:31:13.708
They stuff them with things.

1:31:15.916 --> 1:31:18.083
I'm fine, Mom. I…

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:20.708
just wanted to say hi.

1:31:23.875 --> 1:31:25.208
No, don't wake him up.

1:31:26.208 --> 1:31:27.250
It's fine.

1:31:28.041 --> 1:31:29.041
Give him my love.

1:31:31.875 --> 1:31:33.083
Bye, Mom. Goodnight.

1:32:03.833 --> 1:32:05.166
Can it fit two people?

1:32:10.750 --> 1:32:13.291
I mean the boat. Can it fit two people?

1:32:13.916 --> 1:32:14.750
"Boat"…

1:32:15.250 --> 1:32:17.458
This one here? Yes, sure…

1:32:19.166 --> 1:32:22.250
It was just my way of saying
I'm coming with you.

1:32:24.833 --> 1:32:25.666
With me?

1:32:26.250 --> 1:32:27.083
Okay.

1:32:27.916 --> 1:32:30.875
I called Strasbourg.
They said there was a problem.

1:32:30.958 --> 1:32:33.666
Your mom said you were heading back.
I thought you'd be here.

1:32:33.750 --> 1:32:34.791
Can you hurry?

1:32:34.875 --> 1:32:37.458
-I see… I couldn't understa--
-Can you hurry up?

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:41.000
-Sorry, but--
-No. Clearly, I'm not getting married.

1:32:41.083 --> 1:32:45.041
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
But please, don't make me regret it.

1:33:11.958 --> 1:33:13.916
It's strange seeing it so empty.

1:33:17.041 --> 1:33:20.041
And yet they hate it, even if it's empty.

1:33:22.916 --> 1:33:24.625
What do you think they'll do?

1:33:27.166 --> 1:33:28.500
I don't know, Giorgio.

1:33:29.208 --> 1:33:32.458
Something to prove their point,
a symbolic act, you know.

1:33:36.666 --> 1:33:38.333
Thanks for being here with me.

1:33:47.375 --> 1:33:49.041
You know, now it doesn't…

1:33:50.083 --> 1:33:51.250
look like a…

1:33:52.625 --> 1:33:53.833
like a disco.

1:33:55.625 --> 1:33:58.000
Finally, you admit it!

1:33:58.083 --> 1:33:59.875
It took a long time!

1:33:59.958 --> 1:34:02.125
Is it true what they say?

1:34:04.416 --> 1:34:05.458
What do they say?

1:34:07.250 --> 1:34:08.958
That you did all this for me.

1:34:11.041 --> 1:34:13.291
That I did all this for you?

1:34:15.583 --> 1:34:19.041
If we really want to go back
to the genesis of the idea,

1:34:20.333 --> 1:34:25.041
it's a type of concept,
a search for absolute freedom.

1:34:25.125 --> 1:34:25.958
So it's always--

1:35:27.666 --> 1:35:30.166
So much for a symbolic act.

1:35:51.166 --> 1:35:53.875
An honor to have you, Admiral.
The ships are in position.

1:35:53.958 --> 1:35:55.083
Civilians on the island?

1:35:55.166 --> 1:35:57.708
Two. Giorgio Rosa
and an unidentified girl.

1:35:57.791 --> 1:36:00.333
Perfect. We'll wait for Rome
to green-light the attack.

1:36:00.416 --> 1:36:04.250
Let's get moving. Load the cannons.
I want to be home for dinner.

1:36:04.333 --> 1:36:07.250
Here's the bar.
As you can see, it's already equipped.

1:36:07.750 --> 1:36:09.541
This year the licenses are on hold,

1:36:09.625 --> 1:36:12.458
but you could turn it
into a restaurant in the future.

1:36:12.541 --> 1:36:16.208
Now, if you can sign here,
so I can get back to City Hall.

1:36:16.291 --> 1:36:17.458
It's so busy today.

1:36:19.125 --> 1:36:23.250
You'll have to tell me
how you got the permit so quickly.

1:36:23.333 --> 1:36:24.916
It's been on hold for years.

1:36:27.541 --> 1:36:28.875
What's going on today?

1:36:29.541 --> 1:36:32.750
They say they're blowing up Rose Island.

1:36:33.875 --> 1:36:36.541
If you could please sign now.
I need to leave.

1:37:01.750 --> 1:37:04.000
Good morning, everyone, here we are.

1:37:04.083 --> 1:37:06.250
The showdown
between the Italian government

1:37:06.333 --> 1:37:08.000
and what is known as Rose Island…

1:37:08.083 --> 1:37:11.041
It seems we're back
to the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

1:37:11.125 --> 1:37:12.666
Will Italy have its own Bay of Pigs?

1:37:12.750 --> 1:37:15.041
We're in front of Rose Island…

1:37:27.250 --> 1:37:28.125
Come in.

1:37:32.791 --> 1:37:34.458
"Seaside government."

1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.541
We worked 20 hours a day,
including Sundays,

1:37:38.625 --> 1:37:41.291
and here, it looks like
we were lying on a beach sunbathing

1:37:41.375 --> 1:37:43.333
and eating spaghetti with clams.

1:37:43.416 --> 1:37:45.041
What can I say, Giovanni?

1:37:45.125 --> 1:37:47.958
We always complain
this is a country with a short memory.

1:37:48.041 --> 1:37:49.916
At least this time it's in our favor.

1:37:50.458 --> 1:37:53.625
Look, I just need a quick signature.

1:38:00.083 --> 1:38:01.041
Is this a joke?

1:38:02.750 --> 1:38:06.500
Sorry, but I'm the one
who invented the end-of-term prank.

1:38:06.583 --> 1:38:09.625
I'll even tell you when.
Four years ago, when Aldo resigned.

1:38:09.708 --> 1:38:14.291
We brought him a declaration of war
on Albania. You should've seen his face.

1:38:15.125 --> 1:38:18.083
We had a blast.
Giulio cried with laughter.

1:38:18.166 --> 1:38:20.041
Who are we bombing this time?

1:38:20.125 --> 1:38:22.375
Rose Island, Giovanni.
It must be destroyed.

1:38:22.458 --> 1:38:25.625
And how are you planning to do that?
With surface-to-air missiles?

1:38:25.708 --> 1:38:27.625
I gave orders to arm the Andrea Doria.

1:38:28.166 --> 1:38:30.541
I just need your signature for the attack.

1:38:38.250 --> 1:38:40.041
You deployed a battleship from Venice?

1:38:41.625 --> 1:38:42.666
Are you crazy?

1:38:42.750 --> 1:38:46.083
Giovanni, you told me to fix the issue
by any means necessary.

1:38:46.166 --> 1:38:50.583
I asked you to solve a problem,
not to bomb the island.

1:38:51.166 --> 1:38:52.458
And to be honest,

1:38:52.541 --> 1:38:55.458
do you know what the best thing
about an outgoing government is?

1:38:55.541 --> 1:38:57.333
That it's no longer our problem.

1:38:57.416 --> 1:38:59.791
After all, it's just an island,
a summer place.

1:38:59.875 --> 1:39:02.875
If they open again in June,
it'll be the next government's problem.

1:39:02.958 --> 1:39:04.083
Who cares?

1:39:04.166 --> 1:39:07.000
Giorgio Rosa appealed
to the European Council.

1:39:07.083 --> 1:39:09.250
And they agreed to look into his case.

1:39:09.875 --> 1:39:11.291
Do you know what that means?

1:39:11.833 --> 1:39:15.291
If they accept his appeal,
the island will be a fully-fledged state,

1:39:15.375 --> 1:39:17.041
just steps away from the communists.

1:39:18.916 --> 1:39:20.791
And am I supposed to sign an act of war?

1:39:21.666 --> 1:39:25.500
Giovanni, we are the only ones left
who can do something about this.

1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:27.666
Trust me.

1:39:39.291 --> 1:39:41.875
Warships are surrounding the island.

1:39:43.291 --> 1:39:44.625
Nothing gets past you.

1:39:46.875 --> 1:39:48.208
We have to do something.

1:39:49.375 --> 1:39:50.750
Besides drinking, you mean?

1:39:50.833 --> 1:39:52.250
We have to go and defend it.

1:39:53.875 --> 1:39:57.250
Sorry to disappoint you,
but they won't let the Laura Madre<i> </i>pass.

1:39:58.000 --> 1:39:59.250
Not the<i> </i>Laura Madre, no,

1:40:00.125 --> 1:40:01.208
but all the others…

1:40:01.875 --> 1:40:02.916
maybe.

1:40:45.083 --> 1:40:48.166
Operations, something's fast approaching,
36 degrees east.

1:40:48.666 --> 1:40:50.250
What do you mean "something"?

1:40:50.333 --> 1:40:52.916
I don't know,
lots of small things, like a little fleet.

1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.666
Water-skiing.
It's a water-skiing competition.

1:40:56.750 --> 1:41:00.041
-During a military operation?
-Authorized by the port authority.

1:41:00.125 --> 1:41:02.833
I don't bloody care!
Stop them immediately!

1:41:02.916 --> 1:41:04.833
They all paid the entry fee months ago.

1:41:04.916 --> 1:41:07.458
The port authority won't accept liability
or refund them.

1:41:12.375 --> 1:41:13.208
Fine.

1:41:14.541 --> 1:41:15.375
Fine.

1:41:16.250 --> 1:41:18.291
Tell them we're turning now!

1:41:18.375 --> 1:41:20.375
Neumann, we're turning!

1:41:46.583 --> 1:41:48.416
Rome has authorized the attack, sir.

1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:50.375
Perfect. Call the admiral, come on.

1:41:50.458 --> 1:41:52.791
Sir, we have another problem.

1:41:55.250 --> 1:41:58.375
I told you the water-skiing competition
was a good idea.

1:42:00.625 --> 1:42:02.750
I'm sorry, my friend. Really.

1:42:03.958 --> 1:42:06.125
Nice to meet you. I'm Neumann.

1:42:06.708 --> 1:42:08.291
Nice to meet you. Gabriella.

1:42:08.375 --> 1:42:12.416
I'm the organizer of this competition
that helped avoid a military occupation.

1:42:13.416 --> 1:42:16.833
Next time, we'll organize it
for the end of August. It's freezing now!

1:42:16.916 --> 1:42:18.541
If there is a next time.

1:42:19.250 --> 1:42:20.583
Neumann's here now!

1:42:20.666 --> 1:42:23.625
Let me talk to them.
I've been through war before.

1:42:24.125 --> 1:42:26.333
Sorry, I need to put some clothes on.

1:42:31.208 --> 1:42:32.041
So,

1:42:32.541 --> 1:42:35.458
our objective today,
is to wipe out that pile of junk--

1:42:35.541 --> 1:42:37.083
Admiral, we have a problem.

1:42:37.166 --> 1:42:39.458
The civilians on the island
have multiplied.

1:42:39.541 --> 1:42:42.708
What do you mean "multiplied"?
They're not bloody bacteria!

1:42:42.791 --> 1:42:46.041
They used the water-ski competition
as a cover to get on the island.

1:42:47.791 --> 1:42:49.250
Mr. Carrisi,

1:42:49.958 --> 1:42:52.500
you're very lucky to be this young.

1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.583
You know what they did to people like you
on the hellish routes to Benghazi?

1:42:56.666 --> 1:42:57.708
I'm sorry, sir.

1:42:57.791 --> 1:42:59.833
Aim the cannons,
and fire two warning shots.

1:42:59.916 --> 1:43:01.375
They're just spineless kids.

1:43:01.458 --> 1:43:04.375
They'll run away
as soon as they smell the gunpowder.

1:43:04.458 --> 1:43:05.291
Yes, sir.

1:43:17.625 --> 1:43:18.833
What do we do now?

1:43:20.625 --> 1:43:22.125
What do you say, Rudy?

1:43:22.791 --> 1:43:23.791
God knows.

1:43:24.708 --> 1:43:27.916
"God knows"? You always go on about
how you've been to war.

1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:29.833
I didn't think they'd aim the cannons.

1:43:32.250 --> 1:43:34.166
They're only trying to scare us.

1:43:36.083 --> 1:43:37.166
I'm not buying it.

1:44:33.666 --> 1:44:36.125
Soldiers… they're all the same.

1:44:36.625 --> 1:44:40.125
They act threatening,
but they don't have the balls to shoo--

1:45:12.291 --> 1:45:14.791
Admiral, the civilians are still there,
holding hands.

1:45:15.958 --> 1:45:17.416
They're challenging us, sir.

1:45:19.875 --> 1:45:21.041
Shoot closer.

1:45:23.208 --> 1:45:25.541
Admiral, I'd advise against it.
It's too risky.

1:45:25.625 --> 1:45:27.458
Shoot closer.

1:45:36.958 --> 1:45:40.416
Well, I guess I was wrong.
We should go now. At least we tried.

1:45:41.041 --> 1:45:42.000
I'm not moving.

1:45:42.083 --> 1:45:44.833
Rudy's right. They're firing cannons.

1:45:44.916 --> 1:45:46.333
Staying here is suicide.

1:45:47.416 --> 1:45:48.708
Think of the baby.

1:45:49.250 --> 1:45:50.250
What do you mean?

1:45:50.750 --> 1:45:52.708
What about
the "first natural-born citizen"?

1:45:52.791 --> 1:45:55.458
You're still going on about that?

1:45:55.541 --> 1:45:57.333
It was bullshit, a joke!

1:45:58.166 --> 1:46:01.125
Giorgio, listen, I know how soldiers--

1:46:01.208 --> 1:46:03.708
It was good knowing you, Rudy.

1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:21.375
Send in the Raiders.

1:50:28.375 --> 1:50:29.375
Listen…

1:50:31.916 --> 1:50:34.000
about your dad's TV that time,

1:50:34.833 --> 1:50:35.666
I'm sorry.

1:50:37.500 --> 1:50:38.625
I never apologized.

1:50:42.333 --> 1:50:43.791
It's okay. Who cares.

1:50:44.708 --> 1:50:46.833
The important thing's to change the world.

1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:57.208
Or at least try to.

1:51:32.625 --> 1:51:36.875
The Council of Europe declared
it couldn't deliberate on the dispute

1:51:36.958 --> 1:51:40.083
between the Italian State
and the free Republic of Rose Island

1:51:40.166 --> 1:51:42.833
as the island
was outside European territorial waters,

1:51:42.916 --> 1:51:45.541
essentially acknowledging it
as an independent state.

1:51:46.333 --> 1:51:49.666
To prevent similar events
from happening again,

1:51:49.750 --> 1:51:52.208
the UN moved the borders
of international waters

1:51:52.291 --> 1:51:54.750
from 6 to 12 nautical miles,
all around the world.

1:51:55.833 --> 1:51:59.208
To this day,
the destruction of Rose Island

1:51:59.291 --> 1:52:02.500
is the one and only invasion
perpetrated by the Italian Republic.

1:52:03.875 --> 1:52:08.166
Giorgio and Gabriella
spent the rest of their lives together.
