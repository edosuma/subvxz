00:09.160 --> 00:11.559
- Cheers.
- See you later, mate.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.039
How you doing in there?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.839
I'll be fine. Did they go?

00:39.200 --> 00:40.999
Mmm-hmm, all gone.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.199
I had to.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.839
Mmm.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.479
You sure you've got the passports?

01:01.640 --> 01:04.319
I've got the passports.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.439
Show me the passports.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.879
Oh!

01:28.520 --> 01:30.239
I don't believe it.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.279
Did you give them a tip?

01:33.360 --> 01:35.319
Yeah, I gave them a tip.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.599
No, this is a different lot.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.759
Sure.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.199
On the floor! Floor now!

01:58.280 --> 02:00.879
Shut up! I said shut up.

02:00.960 --> 02:03.199
Don't move.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.239
James Carrodus.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.559
Dealer of fine art.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.719
Quite the reputation,

02:18.800 --> 02:20.559
but not above the odd
privately brokered deal,

02:20.640 --> 02:24.799
selling fakes to Russian billionaires
who don't know any better, huh?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.839
And this cash,
James, was liquefied in the form

02:27.920 --> 02:31.439
of 18 cut diamonds
of outstanding quality.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.519
'Cause that's the best way
to carry serious wealth, am I right?

02:37.920 --> 02:39.639
Now you're off
to start a new life in Rio

02:39.720 --> 02:41.479
with your beautiful bride, Jessica.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.519
The limousine arrives in,
what, James? 15 minutes?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.079
- Ten.
- Ten.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.479
In 10 minutes,
you could both be in that limo.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.039
All I need you to do
is give me those diamonds.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.479
I don't have them.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.159
Okay.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.599
Okay.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.999
There's nothing.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.319
You go get me those diamonds, James.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.799
In two hours. Let's call at 10:15.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.279
I've got those 18 diamonds in my hand

03:41.000 --> 03:43.879
or we start cutting
the lovely Jessica here.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.839
All right. All right.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.559
At this point, I'm sure you're asking
yourself, "Is he bluffing?"

03:52.840 --> 03:54.639
I know you'll appreciate,

03:54.720 --> 03:57.279
that it's in my best interest
to prove that I'm not.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.519
Apologies in advance, Jessica.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.319
You don't... You don't have to do this.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.799
- No, no, no. No, please!
- Look you don't have to...

04:04.880 --> 04:06.479
- I'll get you the...
- No!

♪ Love is like a sin, my love

04:16.440 --> 04:21.199

Justin.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.479
Hello, sir. Can I help?

05:08.080 --> 05:09.239
Ian Reed?

05:09.320 --> 05:11.119
I need to see Ian Reed.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.519
Er, I'm afraid DCI Reed is elsewhere.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.039
I'm DCI John Luther.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.679
I share an office with Mr Reed.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.519
This is DS Ripley.
Can I help you? Come on.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.519
It's her tongue.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.079
You sure you want to play it this way,
Dan? It's pretty hardcore.

05:34.160 --> 05:36.799
The police, they get involved.
Kidnap, it's going to be.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.879
Did you just use my name
in front of the victim, Tom?

05:50.080 --> 05:52.119
James, the fact of it is

05:52.320 --> 05:54.239
most kidnappings don't come
to our attention

05:54.320 --> 05:56.519
because when it comes to family members,

05:56.600 --> 05:58.839
people pay up pretty fast.

06:01.280 --> 06:02.719
You think I don't want to do that?

06:02.800 --> 06:06.599
You think I don't want to give them what
they asked for and get my wife back?

06:06.680 --> 06:07.999
- Do you think that?
- James,

06:08.080 --> 06:11.479
I just need to understand
what's happening.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.479
I came to see you because
I haven't got what they want.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.839
And I've no way of getting it.

06:22.920 --> 06:23.999
What are you saying?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.079
Jessica swallowed them.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.759
The diamonds are inside her right now.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.679
If I'd have told them that,
they'd have cut her open on the spot.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.359
Sorry.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.719
Oh, yeah, well, that's,
er, Bill Winingham.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.119
He sent Carrodus directly to you.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.679
- Oh, yeah?
- How well do you know him?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.799
Yeah, pretty well.
He's a money launderer, basically.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.479
Bit of a gent, as it goes.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.239
Never involved
in any bloodshed, not to my knowledge.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.399
Right, thing is, he was the one
that procured the diamonds

06:57.480 --> 06:58.959
for Carrodus in the first place

06:59.040 --> 07:02.319
and he's the only third party
to know that they even exist.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.439
So if anyone set this up,
I think he's our man.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.559
Turns out, no one's seen
Winingham for three or four days.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.759
So we can't find our sole lead?

07:10.840 --> 07:14.559
No. And the kidnappers
want their ransom in just over an hour.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.319
You think they'll make good
on their threat?

07:16.600 --> 07:17.799
Absolutely.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.079
Um, listen, Bill knows me,
so do his friends and family.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.919
Do you want me to go out
there, see if I can round him up,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.199
find out what the hell's going on?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.479
Yeah, see if you can do that.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.079
So, they won't give us what we want.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.279
We can't give them what they want.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.319
No, we can't give it to them,
but we can lend it to them.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.639
Meaning?

07:42.200 --> 07:44.919
- Let's visit the evidence safe.
- Don't want to hear it.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.999
Boss, these are
very special circumstances.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.439
Same rules do not apply.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.519
Chain of evidence
is like the Ten Commandments.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.679
It applies unto time and all eternal.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.239
Anything in the evidence
safe is sacrosanct.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.879
We tamper, we risk voiding active cases.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.519
Only if we get found out.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.719
Am I actually having this conversation?

08:03.800 --> 08:05.719
Are you actually saying this to me?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.239
Boss, listen.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.319
Listen to me carefully. If we do not
have any security to play with,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.839
then Jessica dies.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.599
- If I start stealing evidence...
- Borrowing.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.719
If I start borrowing evidence
to use for my own purposes...

08:19.800 --> 08:22.559
It won't be out of my sight
for a second.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.239
Of course I understand.
He's your husband.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.519
Oh, no. He's not.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.119
Let me say it. Let me get it out.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.719
And then it's said. It's said and done.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.999
I don't want to ever have
this conversation again.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.279
I'm gonna go away for a couple of
days and give you time to think.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.239
- There's nothing to think about.
- Yes, there is.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.839
And if you decide to stay with me,

08:58.920 --> 09:02.239
there'll be no recrimination,
no blame, no nothing.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.439
We pick up where we left off,
and we carry on.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.959
- But?
- But,

09:09.360 --> 09:10.799
you can never see him again.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.559
Not ever. That means
no phone calls, no emails, no nothing.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.479
It's necessary for me.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.519
I can't let you do this
to me again. I can't.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.679
- Babe.
- John.

09:32.880 --> 09:33.879
Can I see you?

09:34.720 --> 09:36.239
Absolutely. Erm...

09:36.320 --> 09:37.559
I just got a lot of stuff going on here.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.479
Can I call you later?

09:39.560 --> 09:42.359
Okay, but I really need to see you.
It needs to be today.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.879
No, me too. All right?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.879
Erm, I'll call you the moment
I get a chance.

09:48.360 --> 09:49.679
All right.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.479
How much are these worth?

10:07.560 --> 10:08.999
I don't know, about £3.5 million.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.119
I appreciate the effort, but these
people want something very specific.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.399
They want 18 diamonds
of a particular size, quality and value.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.079
That's the best we can do.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.279
- It's not what they want.
- James,

10:24.360 --> 10:25.679
I'm gonna need you to understand that

10:25.760 --> 10:28.919
unless we find a way to open up lines of
communication with the kidnappers,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.239
they're going to kill Jessica.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.039
Not tomorrow or the next day,

10:32.120 --> 10:33.879
but before this hand gets here.

10:36.680 --> 10:38.039
So you will deliver these diamonds.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.599
But you'll attach a note that says,

10:39.680 --> 10:41.879
"Give me Jessica
and you'll get the rest."

10:41.960 --> 10:44.679
- They won't go for it.
- No, they won't go for it.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.679
But we'll have given them
a good enough reason

10:46.760 --> 10:48.999
to keep Jessica alive a little longer

10:49.520 --> 10:51.479
and we will have made
our first contact.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.199
Once we can achieve that
then we can think about the next stage.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.799
Hmm.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.279
Ian. It's not my fault!

11:04.840 --> 11:06.519
It's not my fault.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.599
Look, we all know the rules, all right?

11:10.960 --> 11:12.919
You rob a thief of stolen money,

11:13.000 --> 11:14.359
he thinks of that as cost of business.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.599
He's not going to the police,
nobody gets hurt,

11:16.680 --> 11:17.839
no innocents are involved.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.839
And that's the way these things have
worked since I was a woodentop.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.519
Now this is kidnapping, Bill.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.399
They took his wife.
They cut out her tongue.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.879
Oh, sweet Mary.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.999
- So what happened?
- I don't know.

11:34.400 --> 11:38.519
All I know is that they're
supposed to call with the all-clear,

11:38.600 --> 11:40.839
but I've heard nothing.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.519
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.679
No, that's not good enough.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.199
Okay, you need
to listen to me, all right?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.679
You need to forget
about the money. The money's gone.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.159
The money doesn't matter.
You need to tell me what you know.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.039
Who did your nephew recruit for the job?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.079
Some...

11:59.160 --> 12:02.239
Some American he hooked up with over
there when he was at school.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.359
He's a bright boy. He's a clever boy.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.519
Some American? That's it?

12:05.600 --> 12:07.839
I don't know where they are!

12:07.920 --> 12:09.639
Bill, they are going to kill her.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.039
Oh, Jesus.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.559
Okay? And I can't
be responsible for her death.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.959
Not because the chance to make
a few easy quid went wrong.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.319
So I have to make sure she gets through
this. Do you understand me?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.879
Whatever it takes, I have
to get her through this.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.279
Of course.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.879
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.439
All right, Westfield Shopping
Centre. Central Hall. 20 minutes.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.919
20 minutes, er...

12:56.640 --> 12:58.679
I don't think I can make it. I need...

13:15.400 --> 13:16.839
Entrances and exits covered.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.359
Received.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.959
Echo 1 in position.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.119
Echo 2 in position.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.199
Affirmed.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.039
Carrodus coming into position.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.359
Eyeball on Carrodus.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.039
Okay. Here we go, people.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.679
What... What's this?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.199
Couple of hoodies.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.879
- Subject's been handed something.
- It's a note. Instructions.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.959
Pick 'em up, Ripley.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.359
Yeah, I'm there.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.399
All right.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.279
John, stay on Carrodus.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.479
I'm gonna move then.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.479
Visual on the coffee bar.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.159
Nope. No visual.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.919
Thank you very much.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.159
Diamonds are in the bag.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.719
Received.
Benny, track the hoodies.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.319
Tracking.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.479
Ah!

14:11.520 --> 14:12.879
Are you getting this, Benny?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.159
A wasp in a wheelie bin.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.919
Yeah. Have uniform pick 'em up,
they're no kidnappers.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.359
Just kids that'll have been given money
to give Carrodus that note.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.439
Well, go.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.519
Eyeball on Carrodus. Level 2.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.119
What's he waiting for?

14:39.520 --> 14:41.279
I'm watching. Benny, what's he doing?

14:41.360 --> 14:43.639
I don't know. But we don't like it.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.679
He's made his drop.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.879
Yeah.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.119
Cover all second-floor
stairs and escalators.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.199
Okay, I've got an eyeball. Two live
ones. One male, one female.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.639
Here we go, here we go.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.479
Subjects approaching drop point.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.479
They have the bag.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.679
Son of a bitch!

15:17.480 --> 15:18.799
What's wrong?

15:18.880 --> 15:20.559
She's not happy. Something's wrong.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.559
I don't know.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.599
Get in closer, can you?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.919
- No diamonds.
- What do you mean, no diamonds?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.799
I mean, run the bastard down. Go! Go!

15:31.240 --> 15:33.239
Justin, if she makes
that call, Jessica's dead!

15:37.400 --> 15:38.919
Don't lose him.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.519
Hey! Hey!

15:54.080 --> 15:56.639
You're under arrest
for the kidnapping of Jessica Carrodus.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.119
You do not have to say anything.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.799
Benny, Benny, come on.

16:01.440 --> 16:02.559
Boss, come on.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.559
John, I've lost him. I'm sorry.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.719
We've lost him? We've lost him.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.759
Oh, shit.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.279
Listen, I don't know
who you are or where you are.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.959
You're still in control here,
so don't put the phone down.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.679
Prolong the situation.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.039
Ensure the safety of the hostages.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.439
Foster relationship between
negotiator and hostage-taker.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.959
But most importantly, keep things calm.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.159
Look, I know you're no amateur.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.879
All right? So I'm not going
to try and play you here.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.359
Yeah, I will try and trace the call,

16:53.440 --> 16:55.239
but it's gonna take me a
couple of minutes to get in motion.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.159
By the time I do that,
you'll be long gone.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.719
You've got one minute.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.359
Carrodus kept the ransom.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.519
He did, huh?

17:04.680 --> 17:06.598
Last-minute calculation.
The way he sees it,

17:06.680 --> 17:08.959
Jessica was going to die
even if he gave you the money,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.199
so why give you the money?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.719
Looks like we both lost him, right?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.638
Look, I don't care about him.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.439
I want Jessica back. That's all we want.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.319
No, it's not. No, you want to arrest
me and send me to prison.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.319
Yeah, I do want that.
But that's not an outcome I can expect,

17:24.400 --> 17:26.439
not right now,
not given the circumstances.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.358
So I'm going to go for plan B,

17:28.440 --> 17:31.679
right, which is get Jessica back alive.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.159
What's your name?

17:33.240 --> 17:36.319
John. But don't doubt
that I can get you what you want.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.479
I just... Just give me three hours.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.159
I tell you what,

17:40.520 --> 17:43.239
you give me a number
and I'll call you on it in one hour.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.759
- I'll need proof of life.
- You won't get it, John.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.999
You see, this is a game
of trust now, John.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.079
Do you think you can manage that?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.839
All right, take this number down.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.559
Uncle Bill, it's gone bad.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.799
What do you mean?

17:58.880 --> 18:00.039
There's no ransom.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.599
There's hot and cold running police.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.919
- Shit.
- What?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.279
They've nicked Evie. Daniel's lost it.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.399
If I go back to him empty-handed,
no diamonds, no Evie, right, that's it.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.159
That's it. I've had it, I've had it.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.399
Tom, I've got somebody here
that needs to talk to you.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.239
Jesus, Bill, who've you got there?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.959
Don't panic. He's a friend,
all right? He's a friend.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.039
Who's there?

18:19.120 --> 18:21.719
Okay, Tom. You need to listen to me
now. Okay? Are you listening?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.199
- Who are you?
- Are you listening?

18:24.280 --> 18:26.199
Yes, yes! I'm listening.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.399
Where are they keeping her?

18:27.760 --> 18:28.839
I'm not going to tell you that, am I?

18:28.920 --> 18:32.199
Okay, Tom,
you can still get out of this,

18:32.760 --> 18:34.399
with the money, do you understand me?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.079
No, no, look, I'm sorry, no, I don't. I
don't understand, I don't get it.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.719
The woman, okay, the woman,
Jessica Carrodus.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.839
She has the diamonds.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.679
Just get her away from
wherever she's being kept.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.439
Get her away safely
and you can have it all.

18:47.520 --> 18:48.599
I can't!

18:48.680 --> 18:51.559
If you don't do this...
If you don't do this,

18:51.640 --> 18:53.159
hand to God, I'll kill you myself.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.399
Anything?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.919
Not a word. No prints on record.
No nothing.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.639
You know, she may not have been
our problem up until now,

19:05.720 --> 19:06.919
but she'll have been someone's.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.399
You don't start off at kidnapping.
You work your way up to it.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.159
Why don't you send her details
to Detective Munch in New York.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.799
He's Special Victims Unit there.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.239
Sir.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.519
"The evidence won't leave
our sight for a second"?

19:24.600 --> 19:25.719
We'll get it back.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.599
We'd better, because right this second,

19:27.680 --> 19:29.719
I'm peddling thin air
like Wile E. Coyote.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.279
I'm sorry.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.559
- Can I get five minutes?
- You can have two.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.839
How are you? Good?

19:38.920 --> 19:41.399
Nice to see you. Bye-bye, then.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.599
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.759
I haven't seen you in here forever.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.119
I know, it was a long time back.

19:52.480 --> 19:54.079
I need a moment.

19:55.720 --> 19:56.959
I can't.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.239
It's a madhouse today.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.559
Can I see you later?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.359
Not really.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.399
Are you really going
to do this to me today?

20:11.480 --> 20:13.799
In front of everyone?

20:14.240 --> 20:17.039
I can't make a scene, yeah?

20:18.080 --> 20:19.279
'Cause you're safer here.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.239
What do you want me to do? Beg you?

20:23.320 --> 20:25.359
- 'Cause I've done that.
- I don't want that. I don't want that.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.759
You want... You want me to ask you why?

20:28.840 --> 20:30.919
You already know why.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.399
Zoe, you say that. And I... I don't.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.239
I mean I think about it and then...

20:40.600 --> 20:42.439
I really do think and just nothing.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.079
I don't know why
you keep doing this to me.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.039
You and me, these
last few days, it's just been...

20:47.120 --> 20:51.119
It's just been a way
of saying goodbye properly.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.599
And I think we both knew that deep down.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.399
We knew it, didn't we?

21:04.080 --> 21:05.399
Zoe.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.959
I didn't know.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.759
Do you know who she is?

21:31.920 --> 21:35.479
Do you have any clue what she might
be going through right now?

21:35.560 --> 21:36.999
Where she is?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.319
Do you want to see her tongue?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.959
'Cause I have it somewhere
here in a napkin. Get out.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.439
- John...
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

21:53.160 --> 21:54.599
Oh! Whoa!

21:56.440 --> 21:58.079
All right, back to work!

21:59.200 --> 22:01.039
The clock is ticking!

22:46.040 --> 22:48.319
- Did you speak to Munch?
- Er, yeah.

22:48.400 --> 22:52.279
Evangeline Nixon. Long history of
violence, extortion, suspected kidnap.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.799
Married to this man,
Daniel Sugarman, 36.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.279
Even longer history.

22:56.360 --> 22:59.239
Armed robbery, extortion, kidnap.
More than one murder.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.599
Yeah, that's him.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.039
No facial tattoo.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.599
No, I bet it's fake.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.439
Just look at his face.
That's all you're going to remember.

23:07.120 --> 23:09.559
- When's he due to call?
- In about four minutes.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.159
Oi, Winingham?

23:11.480 --> 23:12.999
No sign of him.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.039
All right. All right.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.279
All right. I'm here.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.159
Do you have it?

23:36.240 --> 23:37.319
Most of it.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.919
Most of it is not what
we agreed, John. Deal's off.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.079
What about Jessica?

23:41.160 --> 23:42.879
You have to get
this into your head, all right?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.119
I don't care about her.

23:45.640 --> 23:48.119
If I no longer believe
her to be of sufficient value to you,

23:48.200 --> 23:50.839
then her value to me
diminishes sharply. Do you understand?

23:51.760 --> 23:54.279
And right now, it seems to me
that she's verging on worthless.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.479
Well, okay, we've got
Evangeline. I mean, what's her value?

23:57.800 --> 24:01.279
To you, Evie's an asset of very limited
benefit. I know she's safe.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.199
I know you can't hurt her.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.079
I know she's strong and won't say a damn
word about me. So keep her.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.599
She's not in play here.
She's just a captured piece.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.999
You bring me the money. Last chance.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.159
All right, okay, I can get
£3 or £4 million.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.479
But it's going to take some time.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.719
You have one hour.
Plus, here's a revised deal.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.279
You give me 100% of what I want,
you get back 100% of Jessica.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.639
You bring me 80%
of what I want, you get 80% of Jessica.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.399
And so on. You take longer than an hour,

24:30.400 --> 24:33.039
you don't get to know
how she died or where I dumped her.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.279
- All right, how long?
- Two to three minutes.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.079
Make it two minutes.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.199
Shh! Shh!

24:48.280 --> 24:50.959
Please, Jessica. Hey, I'm trying to get
you out of here, all right?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.839
I'm trying to get you home.

24:56.680 --> 24:57.679
Please.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.039
I know they're inside of you.

25:01.120 --> 25:04.519
If you do not let me help you,
he's gonna cut them out.

25:04.600 --> 25:07.919
So, please, please help me here.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.839
Thank you.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.879
We offered Daniel a swap.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.079
You for Jessica. Do you want
to know what he said?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.359
We've got Evangeline,
I mean, what's her value?

25:36.440 --> 25:40.519
You have to get this in your
head, all right. I don't care about her.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.599
I no longer believe her
to be of sufficient value.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.479
Right now it seems to me
that she's verging on worthless.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.839
So keep her. You bring me the money.

25:51.080 --> 25:54.999
Now, I neither have the patience or the
time to feel sorry for you,

25:55.080 --> 25:57.239
so this is a one-time offer.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.119
You tell me where Daniel's staying and
I'll make sure you're looked after.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.839
You've got 10 seconds.

26:02.920 --> 26:07.079
Then after that, I walk out of that
door and you never see me again.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.919
I want to serve my time in the States.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.839
I can arrange that.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.239
That was the burn code.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.639
That means he's on his way.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.679
- That worked.
- So what now?

26:45.760 --> 26:47.879
Jessica's being held alone,

26:47.960 --> 26:51.399
at worst being guarded
by a third kidnapper, Tom Meyer.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.319
Come on!

27:07.840 --> 27:09.119
Get down.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.839
Come on! Come on!

27:25.400 --> 27:26.999
Almost there.

27:31.560 --> 27:32.799
Shit!

29:07.000 --> 29:08.199
You okay?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.399
No, I'm not.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.079
Are you?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.079
No.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.799
Yeah, it should be.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.039
What a God Almighty mess this is.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.159
Have we, um, put it together?

29:38.640 --> 29:40.159
Well, best guess?

29:40.240 --> 29:42.279
Jessica sees Meyer as a nice guy.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.239
You know, her best way out of here.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.799
Classic Stockholm response.

29:46.640 --> 29:49.119
So she tells him about the diamonds.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.839
Meyer decides to rescue her,
maybe keep the diamonds for himself.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.039
Then, just as they're leaving,
Sugarman comes back.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.279
He turns on Meyer.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.199
Tortures him until
he gives up what's happening.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.879
So the only possible link to all this

30:03.960 --> 30:06.639
is the money launderer,
Bill what's-his-name?

30:07.240 --> 30:09.279
- Winingham.
- So, track him down.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.239
Throw accessory to multiple
murder, kidnap, extortion.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.359
In the face of that,
he'll give it up in five minutes.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.239
Mate? You all right?

30:23.520 --> 30:26.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.359
It's just, er,

30:29.480 --> 30:31.479
what a mess, eh?

30:31.640 --> 30:32.759
Yeah.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.279
Erm, so, listen, do you want me
to, erm, track down Winingham?

30:39.400 --> 30:41.959
Yes. And I'll go for Sugarman.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.719
He'll have vanished, John.
You know that, he'll be gone.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.919
No, he won't.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.399
No, he knows we'll be
watching the airports and the ports.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.839
He'll probably go underground
somewhere, lay low.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.199
Are you sure you're all right?

30:56.160 --> 30:58.079
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.279
You don't look it.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.479
No. No.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.439
Bad day.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.119
Bad, bad day.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.959
Your nephew's dead.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.279
Sugarman cut off his fingers
and his ear.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.559
Oh!

31:47.760 --> 31:50.079
And then they gutted Jessica and they
took what was inside her.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.479
Do you understand what I'm saying?

31:56.560 --> 31:59.279
Tom only did what he did
because I told him to.

31:59.760 --> 32:03.399
If I'd said nothing,
my friends would've got there in time.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.079
They'd have got to Jessica.
Tom would still be alive.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.599
I made a really bad mistake, Bill.

32:08.680 --> 32:11.319
I made a really, really bad mistake.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.879
That's all right, son.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.719
You didn't mean to, Ian.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.839
I know you didn't mean to.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.039
Okay.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.519
All right, so I... I need you
to concentrate, okay?

32:24.160 --> 32:25.879
I need you to concentrate
because I have to start trying

32:25.960 --> 32:27.759
to clear up this mess, all right?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.799
Does Daniel Sugarman know about me?

32:31.120 --> 32:34.879
He asked if anyone else knew
and I told him no.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.239
He knew I was lying.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.039
It's okay. It's okay.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.359
That's okay. You know what?
I know you had no choice.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.879
I know you had no choice.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.079
What did you tell him?

32:53.640 --> 32:58.159
I told him I knew a copper who could
smooth things over for us if we needed.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.799
As long as nobody gets hurt.

33:02.320 --> 33:05.639
I told him, I said...
I said, "That is a deal-breaker."

33:05.720 --> 33:07.759
No violence, no bloodshed.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.439
Did you give him my name?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.239
No, I wouldn't do that.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.559
Is there anything he asked you to do,

33:13.640 --> 33:16.439
anything that might help me
find him before my friends do?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.319
I don't know.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.599
He said something about passports

33:21.680 --> 33:24.999
and I told him to get in touch
with Patrick Holguin.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.399
That's good, Bill.
That's really, really good.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.199
That might help us.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.199
Will you be okay?

33:36.720 --> 33:39.079
Oh, Bill, this is not about me.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.679
I'm nothing.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.239
Jessica Carrodus is dead,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.759
and I'm gonna have to try
and live with that somehow.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.599
But you've gotta understand
that this has grown.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.679
And if I go to prison for this,

33:52.760 --> 33:55.839
then every case that I've ever convicted
will be questioned.

33:57.040 --> 34:01.279
And all the murderers,
the rapists, the predators,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.319
they might get out.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.359
They might be back on the street.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.438
And whatever they do after that,
whoever they hurt...

34:09.760 --> 34:11.478
..that'll be my fault.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.679
And I can't live with that.
I can't. I just... I just can't.

34:15.760 --> 34:16.958
I'm sorry, son.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.599
Do you want a drink?

34:22.880 --> 34:23.998
Yeah.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.438
I'm so sorry, son.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.159
Me, too.

35:05.200 --> 35:06.879
Thanks for coming.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.519
How could I not?

35:11.120 --> 35:14.679
- You sounded...
- This is such an interesting place.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.759
John Milton was buried here.

35:21.760 --> 35:23.359
- You know Paradise Lost?
- Mmm.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.279
Very well.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.959
He wrote it to justify
the ways of God to men.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.199
But even he couldn't do that.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.119
God emerged as a tyrant.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.479
Satan as a hero.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.359
Where is this leading?

35:43.280 --> 35:45.839
All those things you said to me

35:46.800 --> 35:48.159
about Zoe,

35:48.400 --> 35:52.519
about me, about us, about all of us.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.239
You were right.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.879
There is no love, not really, you know?

35:58.960 --> 36:01.839
Most of its just cruel and deceitful,

36:02.800 --> 36:04.199
just matter.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.719
I saw a lot of matter today.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.399
Matter all over the place.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.519
There is nothing.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.479
There's absolutely nothing.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.239
You know you hurt me very badly.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.799
Don't. Okay?

36:23.520 --> 36:26.319
- No games.
- No games. Listen.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.959
I did what I did to Henry Madsen
because I wanted to help you.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.839
I put my liberty at risk
because I couldn't...

36:38.040 --> 36:39.599
...bear to see you hurt.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.559
So what I did, I did for...

36:46.440 --> 36:48.639
..wholly unselfish reasons.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.599
- I don't...
- Yes, you do.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.439
"The mind is its own place,

36:55.520 --> 36:59.239
"and in itself
can make a heaven of hell,

37:00.160 --> 37:01.759
"a hell of heaven."

37:03.640 --> 37:06.479
The universe isn't evil, John.
It's just indifferent.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.759
That hasn't changed. It can't.

37:12.800 --> 37:15.999
But what I did for you
proved something to me.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.439
Something I hadn't...

37:21.760 --> 37:23.159
..believed...

37:24.800 --> 37:26.959
- ..until that moment.
- What?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.879
It's you who's right.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.399
There is love in the world.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.119
Thank you.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.319
Thank you.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.319
Any progress on Carrodus?

38:12.560 --> 38:14.359
No activity on the credit cards
or the mobile.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.199
Right now I need to see
Evangeline's stuff.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.759
It's fake.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.359
Em, how quickly can we
find out who made this?

38:32.720 --> 38:35.759
Batches of forged passports tend to have
defects specific to the forger,

38:35.840 --> 38:37.799
so Benny should be able
to identify it pretty quickly.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.439
All right, cool.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.119
- Do you want me to come with?
- No. Stay here.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.599
Stay on Carrodus.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.559
Oh, get the diamonds back
in the evidence room,

38:44.640 --> 38:46.439
save the Duchess's sanity.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.679
If I get a line on Sugarman,
I'll call you.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.719
- Patrick, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.239
Can you make me a passport? A good one?

39:05.320 --> 39:06.639
- Best you'll get.
- Yeah?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.919
- There, you see that?
- Oh, no, not again.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.479
All right, now I don't have much time,
so I'm not going to drag this out.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.159
How many fingers
do I have to break before I...

39:20.240 --> 39:23.239
He's staying
at The Renaissance. The big hotel.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.719
How do you know that?

39:24.800 --> 39:27.319
He wanted a total
of nine passports for three people.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.959
- So?
- So nobody buys in that volume,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.599
except terrorists and whatever.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.159
They have a lot
of aircrews at The Renaissance

39:36.240 --> 39:38.319
and I thought, I don't
want anything to do with any of that,

39:38.400 --> 39:39.479
thank you very much.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.239
- So then what?
- So I followed him.

39:44.360 --> 39:47.119
What? You were going to make him pay for
the passports, then grass him up?

39:47.200 --> 39:51.319
Too right. I've got to live
in this city, you know. I've got family.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.919
Not even forgers are honest these
days. Go on, get out of here.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.199
Wait a second.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.879
What did you mean, "not again"?

40:29.440 --> 40:30.759
Hey, John. What's up?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.879
Ian. Don't do it.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.799
Don't do what?

40:37.040 --> 40:38.359
I know what you're about to do.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.439
And what am I about to do?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.639
Look, I saw your face
at the crime scene, all right?

40:45.720 --> 40:47.559
I know it did something to you.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.959
I know how that feels.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.399
But if you hurt Sugarman,
you'll go down for it.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.119
All right? It'll finish you.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.799
Who says I'm going to hurt Sugarman?

40:56.880 --> 40:59.479
I spoke to the passport forger.
I know you're looking for him.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.399
So?

41:02.480 --> 41:06.039
So, look, if you want two minutes with
him alone, break his legs, whatever,

41:06.120 --> 41:09.159
but just let me be there
to tell you when to stop, mate.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.599
All right. Okay, listen,
let's meet at The Fountain.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.359
Fountain, yeah, all right.
Erm, I can be there at 3:00?

41:20.920 --> 41:22.359
All right, but just you.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.479
Not Teller. Not Ripley.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.959
- Just me and you, okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just me and you.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.799
No Ripley, no Teller.
All right, 3:00 at The Fountain.

41:31.520 --> 41:32.839
Okay, bye.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.919
You're not going to be
at The Fountain, are you, Ian?

42:03.320 --> 42:06.039
Excuse me,
no time to bullshit. Is this man here?

42:06.840 --> 42:07.839
Erm...

42:13.520 --> 42:17.599
Oh, you lying bastard, John.
You lying bastard.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.279
Which room?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.199
Listen!

43:35.040 --> 43:37.159
Listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me!

43:37.520 --> 43:40.159
Listen, someone's coming here
for you, okay?

43:40.440 --> 43:43.199
He's coming. He'll be here very
soon if he isn't here already.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.439
Now, ordinarily, I'd let him
do whatever he wants to you,

43:48.600 --> 43:52.279
but he's my mate, okay, and I don't
want to see him go to prison,

43:52.360 --> 43:55.439
so if you want to live,
Daniel, I need you to listen to me.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.839
Come with me. Whoa! Ian, Ian, Ian.

43:57.920 --> 43:59.519
Ian. Ian, listen!

43:59.600 --> 44:03.159
If you kill this man,
that's it for you, you know that, right?

44:03.280 --> 44:05.399
What are you going to do, John?
Arrest me?

44:05.480 --> 44:08.639
No! That's not what I mean
and you know that.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.759
No, I've known you too long, mate.

44:12.840 --> 44:13.999
I know how your mind works.

44:14.080 --> 44:16.199
Ian, this is not a play.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.719
All right? This is not a tactic.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.359
Do you have any idea of the lies
I've told for you over the years,

44:23.440 --> 44:24.879
for all the shit you've done?

44:24.960 --> 44:26.799
Yeah, well I've never
killed anyone, have I?

44:26.880 --> 44:27.999
Yeah.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.479
Not for lack of trying.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.999
And it was you, Ian,
that stopped me every single time.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.279
So here I am, all right,
returning the favour.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.759
Don't do it.

44:39.840 --> 44:43.039
No matter how much
he's earned it. It's not worth it.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.119
- Hold on...
- What did this turd say to you?

44:47.800 --> 44:49.199
- What?
- What did he say about me?

44:49.280 --> 44:51.079
- What do you mean?
- What did he say?

44:51.280 --> 44:52.399
What?

44:53.720 --> 44:54.919
Now it makes sense.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.799
- You must be...
- Shut up.

45:00.400 --> 45:01.639
Shit. Whatever.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.999
Oh!

45:11.760 --> 45:13.359
What did he say?

45:14.480 --> 45:16.639
- I don't know what you mean.
- What did he say?

45:16.760 --> 45:18.359
I don't know what you mean, Ian!

45:18.440 --> 45:21.559
I don't know what you mean,
all right? Help me here, I'm lost.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.119
I'm just lost.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.679
Whatever this is... Whatever this is,

45:26.920 --> 45:29.319
all right, we can make it go away.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.959
I was here to make an arrest.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.519
Sugarman was armed, all right?

45:35.600 --> 45:39.959
You thought my life was in imminent
danger and you took appropriate action.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.079
Don't say that.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.759
- Why?
- Because you don't know what I've done.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.559
I do know what you've done and I don't
care about it, mate. He is nothing!

45:49.640 --> 45:51.519
- No, not him.
- He's nothing.

45:51.600 --> 45:52.719
What?

45:55.480 --> 45:58.039
Look, I knew
about the robbery, all right?

45:59.920 --> 46:02.679
You... You what?

46:05.400 --> 46:09.319
Yeah, I let it go ahead
for a percentage.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.199
And that's why I'm here.

46:11.280 --> 46:13.559
Not for revenge, but to shut him up.

46:13.640 --> 46:17.359
Now, still want to help me?
Still want to make it go away?

46:21.640 --> 46:23.239
Did you know about the kidnapping?

46:23.320 --> 46:24.399
No.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.919
All right, well, then, good,
'cause I don't care.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.239
We can still make this work.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.599
I didn't want any of this, John.
You know that.

46:33.680 --> 46:36.039
I tried to make it right.
I wanted it to be right.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.759
I know. All right. I know.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.079
How can I believe you?
You know how much I want to.

46:43.160 --> 46:44.919
Because you know
when I'm lying.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.839
And right now I'm not lying!

46:49.120 --> 46:50.359
Take it.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.479
All right?

47:01.800 --> 47:03.159
- You lying, bastard. You set me up.
- Whoa, whoa!

47:03.240 --> 47:04.799
No, I didn't, Ian!

47:04.880 --> 47:06.399
Ian!

47:07.480 --> 47:09.599
Did you see him? Did you see anyone?

47:09.680 --> 47:12.039
No? Ian, look, it's just the maid!

47:13.160 --> 47:14.479
Shit.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.479
Ugh.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.119
There were no diamonds found,

47:39.200 --> 47:41.679
and the concierge...

47:44.000 --> 47:45.599
..says that, er,

47:46.640 --> 47:48.519
- this is the gunman.
- Yeah.

47:52.960 --> 47:53.959
I don't know.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.399
All right. That's enough.
Go and get yourself checked out.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.999
Eat. Get some rest.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.919
Ian. Ian, listen to me,
listen to me. We need, erm...

48:25.000 --> 48:27.119
We've got to start talking, mate.
We've got to start talking,

48:27.200 --> 48:29.799
otherwise this is going
to bring us both down, all right?

48:29.880 --> 48:31.839
I need you to talk to me.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.159
Put these away in the safe, would you?

49:36.480 --> 49:37.759
Ah. Hello, sir.

49:37.840 --> 49:40.479
You were going to value
some diamonds for me.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.159
Yes, erm...

49:45.320 --> 49:46.799
They're fakes, James.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.199
They're good fakes, but they're fakes.

49:49.760 --> 49:51.319
Evidence in a fraud trial.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.679
Best we could do at short notice.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.319
Jessica?

50:03.320 --> 50:04.519
Thanks.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.119
Hi, it's me. I'm not going to stay
at Heather and Allan's.

50:10.200 --> 50:12.119
It's silly. I'm going to come home.

50:12.200 --> 50:13.879
I'm going to get in the car
now and I'm going to come home.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.319
I love you.

50:15.400 --> 50:17.639
See you soon.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.159
- Ian?
- Hi. Can I, erm...

50:32.240 --> 50:34.999
- Yeah, of course, of course. Come in.
- Thanks.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.439
Erm, tea?

50:38.240 --> 50:42.319
Er, yeah, yeah. Tea sounds...
Tea sounds great.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.599
Er, unless you've got anything stronger.

50:46.680 --> 50:47.959
Oh, so what's wrong?

50:49.560 --> 50:50.599
Oh.

50:51.840 --> 50:52.919
Bad day.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.239
For everyone, apparently.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.519
Er, listen, Zoe, I need you to...

50:58.600 --> 51:01.799
I need you to call John
for me and, er, ask him over.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.359
- Why?
- Just do it, please. Would you?

51:05.360 --> 51:07.639
But you can't tell him I'm here.

51:08.160 --> 51:09.639
Why not?

51:10.120 --> 51:12.839
- It's complicated.
- And it's my house.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.199
So what's going on?

51:15.640 --> 51:18.319
Okay. You, er...

51:19.520 --> 51:21.119
You ever have
one of those days you wish it would end,

51:21.200 --> 51:22.599
but somehow it never does?

51:22.680 --> 51:24.239
More than my share.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.559
Well, that day's today. Cheers.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.559
And if you do this for me,

51:30.200 --> 51:33.039
all right, you're going to
help end it, so please...

51:34.040 --> 51:35.759
Please, will you just call John?

51:35.840 --> 51:37.079
I can't.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.279
Why not?

51:40.680 --> 51:42.719
Because, actually, you're scaring me.

51:43.480 --> 51:46.119
Look, I don't mean to, I don't mean to.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.799
You know me and John are friends, right?

51:48.880 --> 51:50.679
Well, so call him yourself.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.719
I can't. I can't. I just can't.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.279
It's just things have got
really complicated.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.679
Look, Ian,

51:57.280 --> 52:00.799
I can see things aren't right,
that you're in trouble.

52:02.280 --> 52:05.959
All I can do is tell you to trust
him because he's your friend

52:06.040 --> 52:07.199
and that means a great deal to him,

52:07.280 --> 52:09.719
but I can't call him up and lie to him

52:09.800 --> 52:12.479
and pretend you're not here.
I can't do that.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.599
- You have to.
- No, I don't!

52:28.800 --> 52:30.159
Just do it.

52:30.720 --> 52:32.319
Just get your phone.

52:34.200 --> 52:37.359
Zoe, please. Please get your phone.

52:39.120 --> 52:40.919
I don't want to hurt you.
That's not what I'm here for.

52:41.960 --> 52:46.759
I just need you to call John,
all right, and ask him over.

52:47.600 --> 52:50.079
And when he comes, will you
be pointing that thing at him?

52:50.160 --> 52:51.879
Yeah. I might have to. Just for a bit.

52:51.960 --> 52:55.519
Just so I can sit him down
and make him hear what I've got to say.

52:55.600 --> 52:58.159
All I want is to trust him.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.519
And if I don't?

53:08.880 --> 53:11.839
Don't make me answer that
question, please. Look at me.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.279
Hear what I've got to say.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.279
Don't make me answer that question.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.319
- Ian, please don't.
- Just do it!

53:31.040 --> 53:33.039
I can't find my phone.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.559
Zoe.

54:04.440 --> 54:05.599
John?

54:06.200 --> 54:07.319
Yeah.

54:07.960 --> 54:09.359
John, can you hear me?

54:10.840 --> 54:13.119
Yeah, I can hear you. What's up?

54:16.600 --> 54:19.279
- Ian Reed's here. He's got a gun!
- No, no, no!

54:20.800 --> 54:22.959
- Don't do that. Put it down!
- Help, call the police!

54:24.040 --> 54:25.159
Zoe!

54:26.560 --> 54:29.439
- Shut up! Shut up! Just shut up.
- Just get out of my house!

54:29.520 --> 54:31.599
Listen. Are you there? Zoe?

54:32.200 --> 54:33.559
Zoe, can you hear me?

54:33.640 --> 54:35.999
Shut up. Will you shut up?
Shut the fuck up!

54:36.240 --> 54:37.999
Get out of my house!

54:38.080 --> 54:41.439
Ian, listen to me, this isn't you.
I'm begging you, leave her alone.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.799
- Come on, Zoe, come on.
- Please!

54:43.920 --> 54:45.759
Zoe, Zoe, listen, listen.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.599
Please!

54:48.680 --> 54:49.839
No!

54:52.240 --> 54:54.239
Zo? Babe?

54:55.720 --> 54:56.839
Babe?

54:57.720 --> 54:59.479
Babe, are you there?

55:00.880 --> 55:04.199
No!

55:04.480 --> 55:06.119
Ian? Ian?

55:07.080 --> 55:08.759
Ian, what have you done?

55:09.200 --> 55:12.119
Ian, Ian,
I will kill you, I will kill you.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.759
If you've hurt Zoe, I will kill you.

55:13.840 --> 55:17.639
I swear I will kill you
if you've hurt Zoe, Ian.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.799
This is your fault, John.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.399
Ian, Ian.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.199
This is your doing.

56:01.640 --> 56:02.959
Please be there, please be there.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.239
Rose, Rose!

56:04.320 --> 56:06.439
It's me, John. Listen,
I think Ian's hurt her!

56:06.560 --> 56:09.519
As soon as you
get this message, send a medic!

56:14.040 --> 56:15.119
Zoe!

56:17.160 --> 56:18.239
Zoe!

56:19.360 --> 56:20.439
Zoe!

56:29.280 --> 56:30.399
Zo?

56:35.600 --> 56:37.639
No, no, no, no, no.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.399
Oh.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.839
No, no, no, no.

56:47.760 --> 56:50.159
Babe, babe.

56:52.640 --> 56:53.799
Baby.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.679
Ahhh!

57:15.800 --> 57:17.559
What have you done?

57:24.400 --> 57:25.559
No!

58:04.200 --> 58:05.719
He killed his wife!

58:05.800 --> 58:07.399
Wake up! Stop protecting him!

58:12.520 --> 58:13.799
I am coming for you.

58:13.920 --> 58:16.319
All I have to do is stay free
long enough to see you dead.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.479
- Alice, I need you to help me.
- Where do we start?

58:29.000 --> 58:30.799
- I can bring him in.
- He's gonna kill you.

58:30.880 --> 58:32.559
It's not gonna come to that!

58:36.800 --> 58:39.319
You won't hesitate
to give the kill order?

58:39.400 --> 58:40.879
Absolutely not.

58:41.080 --> 58:43.359
John, run! Run!
