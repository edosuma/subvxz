CHILDREN OF HEAVEN

00:17.650 --> 00:20.175
What shoes have you got today, Madam?

00:20.286 --> 00:21.651
Are they Prada or Gucci?

00:21.721 --> 00:24.781
Which shirt are you wearing today, mister?

00:24.890 --> 00:25.879
And hey, kid,

00:25.958 --> 00:28.119
Who gave you those shoes you got here?

02:26.278 --> 02:30.374
Here you are. That'll be 30 Tomans.

02:33.752 --> 02:37.779
-Thanks a lot. Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.873
Hello, Akbar Aqa. I need some potatoes.

03:35.915 --> 03:39.316
No, don't touch. Take from down there.

03:54.099 --> 04:00.265
Hello, Akbar Aqa. With your permission.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.920
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.337
There will be 65 Tomans.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.467
My mother wants you to debit it
to our account.

04:38.577 --> 04:40.909
You're heavily in debt.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.480
Tell your mother settle at least
part of the debt.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.607
Yes, sir.

05:12.811 --> 05:14.870
See what you have done.

05:15.047 --> 05:18.608
What's the matter with you?

05:18.684 --> 05:20.447
I can't find my sister's shoes.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.645
Get lost. Beat it.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.188
I left my sister's shoes here.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.518
I said beat it.

05:34.266 --> 05:35.995
You are here again...

05:53.052 --> 05:56.146
Don't pour so much water in the yard.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.483
It's sinking...

05:58.624 --> 06:02.025
What can I do with laundry.

06:02.161 --> 06:05.392
Why do you have to do so much laundry?

06:05.497 --> 06:06.964
Well, Mr. Akbar, don't you do your laundry?

06:07.099 --> 06:08.896
I have had enough.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.763
I don't want you in my house any more.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.667
My brother, what I've to do is my laundry.

06:13.806 --> 06:15.137
Move out. That includes everybody.

06:15.240 --> 06:22.874
You are always in arrears with the rent and
you are so wasteful.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.779
Well, don't you do your laundry?

06:26.952 --> 06:29.887
This is the last.

06:30.055 --> 06:36.085
Why don't you come when there're people
like yourself to answer you?

06:36.228 --> 06:41.757
Ali, tell Zahra to peel the potatoes
if she has put the baby to sleep.

07:02.321 --> 07:04.687
Ali, did you get my shoes?

07:04.823 --> 07:08.156
Mother wants you to peel the potatoes
if the baby is asleep.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.990
-I said, did you get my shoes?

07:11.130 --> 07:13.963
-Yes.
-Has he mended them well?

07:20.072 --> 07:20.970
Where are you going?

07:21.073 --> 07:24.133
I want to see how the shoes look.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.343
-I haven't got them.
-You are kidding.

07:28.447 --> 07:31.314
I swear it is true.

07:31.650 --> 07:35.177
I had been to Akbar Aqa's shop
to get potatoes.

07:35.387 --> 07:37.947
When I got back your shoes were gone.

07:38.123 --> 07:40.648
I searched everywhere but I couldn't find them

07:40.793 --> 07:42.784
You mean they're lost?

07:42.928 --> 07:46.955
Don't tell mother. I'll find them.

07:47.132 --> 07:49.657
But how am I to go to school tomorrow?

07:49.768 --> 07:53.795
Don't cry. I'll go and find them right away.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.505
But you said you searched everywhere.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.837
Well, not everywhere.

07:59.711 --> 08:02.305
Don't tell mother, please.

08:17.196 --> 08:22.293
Ali? Come and give me a hand with the rug.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.403
Ali! Where are you going?

08:36.482 --> 08:39.780
We are playing opposite Shahin tomorrow.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.977
Where are you going, Ali?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.774
80 Tomans please.

09:32.070 --> 09:36.530
It's you again! Beat it and
don't ever come back.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.041
What a stubborn boy!

09:43.315 --> 09:47.308
-Hello, Aqa Sayed.
-Hello. How are you?

09:47.452 --> 09:51.218
-Are you going home?
-Yes

09:59.498 --> 10:00.829
Take the lumps of sugar.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.228
Tell your father to chop them...

10:02.367 --> 10:03.834
for next week's mourning session.

10:04.002 --> 10:06.698
-Yes, sir.
-That's a good boy.

10:09.841 --> 10:12.366
The landlord shouldn't have talked to you.

10:12.511 --> 10:19.075
I am responsible for the rent,
and I know how to deal with him.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.881
He's too mean.

10:22.054 --> 10:25.114
You don't have to argue with him.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.884
I'll break his neck.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.051
Why do you keep ignoring your doctor's
recommendations?

10:30.128 --> 10:31.857
You'd not exhaust yourself. Don't get mad!

10:31.997 --> 10:34.261
You shouldn't have done all that laundry.

10:34.366 --> 10:35.594
That rug weights 100 kilos

10:35.701 --> 10:37.032
when it is soaked in water.

10:37.169 --> 10:41.162
And you, Ali! Why didn't you help your mother
when she asked you?

10:41.239 --> 10:46.199
You should have waited for me.

10:46.378 --> 10:48.471
I would have done it myself.

10:48.680 --> 10:53.174
You, boy! Can't you do anything but eat,
sleep and play?

10:53.318 --> 10:54.808
You are not a child anymore,

10:54.987 --> 10:56.249
you are 9 years old.

10:56.388 --> 11:00.119
When I was your age, I helped my parents.

11:00.258 --> 11:02.726
Why do you make me mad?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.557
Haven't you any sense at all?

11:04.696 --> 11:06.926
You just play around all day.

11:07.065 --> 11:09.124
What if your mother was sick?

11:09.234 --> 11:12.067
All right. Don't get excited.

11:12.771 --> 11:16.070
You make me so mad.

11:48.740 --> 11:52.403
I wonder why the baby has been restless all day.

11:54.079 --> 11:58.106
Zahra, pour a cup of tea for your father.

12:19.204 --> 12:26.167
I serve tea at office all day long,

12:26.311 --> 12:30.008
but Zahra's tea tastes different.

12:30.215 --> 12:32.775
You didn't get me the sugar-bowl, dear.

12:32.951 --> 12:35.283
But you have got so much sugar.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.184
This belongs to the mosque.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.381
It's been given to us in trust.

12:40.492 --> 12:42.483
Get some candy from the pot.

12:43.361 --> 12:45.022
We have out of sugar?

12:45.163 --> 12:46.721
I got the coupons but...

12:46.832 --> 12:48.390
the grocer hasn't yet been instructed...

12:48.533 --> 12:50.626
to distribute sugar on coupon.

12:50.802 --> 12:51.928
Never mind the grocer.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.437
He never listens to the radio.

12:55.607 --> 12:56.665
Give the coupon to me and...

12:56.742 --> 13:00.303
I'll get the sugar from the store tomorrow

13:00.479 --> 13:02.709
It's under the rug.

13:17.362 --> 13:26.100
Ali, what am I do tomorrow?

13:26.271 --> 13:33.677
I can't go to school without shoes.

13:33.845 --> 13:39.647
My teacher will blame me.

13:39.751 --> 13:45.917
And get some powder milk for the baby.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.552
All right.

13:49.728 --> 13:53.494
Mr. Rahim's wife suffered from slipped disc.

13:53.598 --> 13:56.795
She had it operated and it got worse.

13:56.935 --> 13:59.233
One shouldn't operate a slipped disc.

13:59.371 --> 14:01.931
One should learn to live with it.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.099
Well, don't expect me to do nothing at all.

14:04.276 --> 14:17.622
Well, you could wear your slippers.

14:32.771 --> 14:36.070
How silly you are!

14:36.241 --> 14:44.148
You lost my shoes and now you expected me
to go to school in my slippers.

14:44.282 --> 14:48.981
I am going to tell father.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.225
If you tell father,

15:04.402 --> 15:06.700
he'll give us both a thrashing...

15:06.872 --> 15:10.239
because he doesn't have money to buy you
a pair of shoes.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.310
What am I to do then?

15:16.948 --> 15:20.907
You could wear my sneakers

15:21.086 --> 15:23.646
I go to school after you come home.

15:23.788 --> 15:31.354
-I don't like it.
-For God's sake.

15:31.496 --> 15:34.294
I beg you to wear my shoes.

16:51.309 --> 16:53.675
It's the salt-seller.

17:28.913 --> 17:32.849
Next.

17:33.184 --> 17:38.281
You, Nilufar.

17:42.093 --> 17:44.254
Now Mary.

17:46.064 --> 17:51.559
Next. Next.

17:54.539 --> 17:57.337
Get up! Are you all right?

17:58.376 --> 18:05.646
Listen children, Mary couldn't jump well
because of her shoes

18:05.850 --> 18:09.616
I have often told you that proper shoes
are very important in sports

18:09.788 --> 18:14.589
And I notice.

18:14.759 --> 18:19.958
That unfortunately some of you
are not wearing sneakers.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.931
Well, some of you are wearing them

18:23.068 --> 18:27.095
It's your turn, Bahare.

19:23.094 --> 19:24.561
Come on!

19:30.668 --> 19:35.367
Why are you late?

19:35.507 --> 19:37.805
It's not my fault. I ran all the way.

19:37.909 --> 19:40.878
Come on, take off the sneakers,
I am going to be late for school.

21:07.031 --> 21:08.896
Did you get to school on time?

21:09.033 --> 21:10.125
No, I arrived after the class had started.

21:10.301 --> 21:11.495
You have to come home earlier.

21:11.669 --> 21:14.001
I left right after the class.

21:14.105 --> 21:16.198
You didn't tell mother, did you?

21:16.341 --> 21:19.174
I promised I wouldn't and I won't.

21:21.312 --> 21:23.303
Your sneakers are very dirty.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.279
I'm ashamed of wearing them.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.042
-That's just an excuse.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.653
-No. They are very dirty.

21:29.787 --> 21:31.755
Well, we can wash them.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.810
-Let's go, Ali, we have got to practice.

22:36.954 --> 22:39.616
-I'm busy.

22:39.757 --> 22:42.191
-It won't take long.
-My mother is ill.

22:42.293 --> 22:43.851
Forget it.

23:05.216 --> 23:09.118
My dear girl did all the housework today and

23:09.287 --> 23:11.050
Ali helped her.

23:11.222 --> 23:13.315
I bought the bread and vegetables.

23:13.458 --> 23:17.758
I swept the floor and washed the vegetables.

23:17.895 --> 23:20.022
That's my good girl.

23:20.264 --> 23:24.928
I'll buy you something nice
when I get a raise

23:31.709 --> 23:34.269
You look much better now.

23:34.512 --> 23:38.004
Leave the housework to the kids.

23:38.182 --> 23:40.241
Get more rest.

23:40.385 --> 23:43.354
In a couple of days you'll recover completely.

24:02.573 --> 24:10.981
-Ali! Get up.
-What is it?

24:11.115 --> 24:14.448
It's raining. The sneakers will get wet.

24:14.585 --> 24:18.282
I'm afraid to go to the courtyard.

26:17.975 --> 26:21.809
Excuse me, ma'am, what time is it?

26:22.647 --> 26:25.946
There is still time to write, go on.

26:49.707 --> 26:52.232
Excuse me ma'am, can I leave now?

26:52.376 --> 26:57.143
Why are you in a hurry?

27:00.051 --> 27:01.712
You may go.

28:31.275 --> 28:32.299
What is it, dear?

28:32.443 --> 28:34.604
Why are you sitting here?

28:34.812 --> 28:35.972
My shoe fell in the stream,

28:36.047 --> 28:37.241
it's stuck under the bridge.

28:37.348 --> 28:40.215
All right, don't cry, I'll get it for you.

29:08.879 --> 29:10.779
Run and catch it.

29:10.915 --> 29:14.146
Catch it, man, catch the shoe.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.622
Where were you?

29:28.532 --> 29:30.295
You are late.

29:39.643 --> 29:40.701
-Why is it wet?

29:40.811 --> 29:42.142
-I won't wear the sneakers any more.

29:42.213 --> 29:45.410
-But why is it wet?
-It fell in the stream.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.107
Now how can I go to school in wet sneakers?

29:47.284 --> 29:49.844
They are too large for me and
they keep coming off my feet.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.581
That's only an excuse.

29:51.722 --> 29:52.654
It's all your fault.

29:52.723 --> 29:54.213
You should not have lost my shoes.

29:54.358 --> 29:55.985
Either you find them or I tell father.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.992
Go ahead. I don't mind getting a thrashing.

29:58.162 --> 30:00.858
But he won't get any money to buy
a new pair of shoes,

30:01.031 --> 30:04.797
and he will have to borrow.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.344
I thought you realized that.

30:44.575 --> 30:46.270
Wait a minute.

30:47.545 --> 30:48.944
Come down here.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.012
Where have you been?

30:54.151 --> 30:55.311
Do you know what time it is?

30:55.452 --> 30:57.682
My home is very far from here, sir.

30:57.855 --> 31:00.722
I don't believe that,
you fool about in the street.

31:00.825 --> 31:03.419
You were also late yesterday.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.530
Next time you're late, you'll be expelled.

31:06.664 --> 31:08.325
Yes, sir.

31:10.601 --> 31:13.365
Why are your shoes wet?

31:14.171 --> 31:16.901
I fell in the stream, sir.

31:17.007 --> 31:17.996
You fell in the stream?

31:18.142 --> 31:19.939
But your trousers are not wet.

31:20.077 --> 31:22.511
-It was a shallow stream, sir.

31:22.646 --> 31:24.409
-It was a shallow stream?

31:31.222 --> 31:34.089
Why aren't even your socks wet?

31:39.163 --> 31:41.859
-Don't let it happen again.

31:41.999 --> 31:43.523
- Yes, sir.

31:55.045 --> 31:56.603
-With your permission

31:56.714 --> 31:58.147
-Take your seat.

32:26.610 --> 32:30.546
We are playing against Shahin team today.

32:37.588 --> 32:42.150
I can't come. My mother is ill.

32:53.037 --> 32:54.834
It's the final match.

32:57.207 --> 32:59.038
What's going on?

32:59.176 --> 33:02.543
Can't you keep quiet until I finish my work?

33:03.047 --> 33:04.241
Sit straight.

33:06.116 --> 33:08.710
Sit down, sit down!

33:10.754 --> 33:16.488
Well, those who were laughing
will soon be crying.

33:16.627 --> 33:20.393
Except for 15 students, everybody failed.

33:20.564 --> 33:23.624
Three students have got up marks.

33:23.867 --> 33:31.501
Karim Nanva, Ali Mandegar, Salman Najafi.

33:34.979 --> 33:36.879
They will stay after the class.

33:37.014 --> 33:39.278
I want to talk to them.

34:02.706 --> 34:06.403
Zahra, Zahra.

34:11.248 --> 34:14.739
Why don't you wait when I call you?

34:14.985 --> 34:16.646
Where are you going?

34:16.754 --> 34:18.380
I'm returning Miss Kobra's bowl.

34:18.522 --> 34:20.284
She brought us sacramental soup.

34:20.357 --> 34:21.984
Are you angry with me?

34:33.270 --> 34:34.965
Is it nice?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.831
-Where did you get it?

34:36.940 --> 34:39.500
-It's a prize from the teacher.

34:39.610 --> 34:45.014
For you. Take it.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.781
-Is it mine?
-Yes.

34:48.085 --> 34:52.487
-I didn't tell mother.
-I know you wouldn't

34:52.623 --> 34:54.215
I'll be back soon.

35:13.377 --> 35:16.676
Ali, get me that tray, dear.

35:27.057 --> 35:30.515
Take the soup for Ms Kokab.

35:42.673 --> 35:43.731
Who is it?

35:43.807 --> 35:47.004
It's me, Ali. I brought some soup for you.

35:47.111 --> 35:48.442
Come in, son.

35:49.746 --> 35:54.911
-Hello.
-Hello, Ali, thanks a lot.

35:55.085 --> 35:58.350
-How is your father?
-He is fine.

36:05.295 --> 36:08.924
You mother should not take the trouble.

36:09.032 --> 36:10.294
It is no trouble.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.130
-How is your mother?
-She is fine.

36:12.269 --> 36:16.137
-Give her my regards.
-Yes, I will.

36:16.206 --> 36:20.336
Wait a minute, Ali.
I've got something for you.

36:23.914 --> 36:26.678
-It's nothing.
-No, thank you.

36:26.817 --> 36:32.346
Take it, son. Give my regards to your father.

36:32.956 --> 36:40.328
-Fall in line.
-Be a good student.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.727
Attention. Obey your teacher.

36:44.868 --> 36:46.961
Soon you'll be sitting for your exam.

36:47.104 --> 36:49.265
and I have a few recommendations for you.

36:49.406 --> 36:51.636
The examination days are the time

36:51.808 --> 36:54.800
when you must reap the fruit
of your previous work.

36:54.945 --> 36:57.311
Therefore, you must work a lot now.

36:57.514 --> 37:01.644
You must plan for your time.

37:01.818 --> 37:04.685
And I will talk to your parents
to make sure you can study....

37:04.821 --> 37:08.188
without any disturbances at home.

37:08.392 --> 37:14.262
You'd not stay late to watch TV series.

37:14.431 --> 37:18.265
You'd only watch the children's programs
such as cartoons.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.996
The rest of your time should be
spent on your lessons.

37:21.205 --> 37:24.174
You could ask your parents ask you questions
from your books

37:24.308 --> 37:30.770
to make sure you've understood everything.

37:30.948 --> 37:37.717
I've already told you that you'd clip
your fingernails regularly.

37:37.888 --> 37:42.086
You should clip them during weekends

37:42.259 --> 37:45.888
Come back to school with clean fingers.

37:46.063 --> 37:49.430
Dirt and microbes collect
under long finger nails...

37:49.600 --> 37:53.263
and when you eat food with dirty fingers
you get sick.

37:53.437 --> 38:00.775
All right, now you may go to your classrooms.

38:00.944 --> 38:09.352
Keep in line, dear.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.083
The pigeons...

38:49.893 --> 38:57.299
The pigeons flew away.

38:57.467 --> 39:07.206
And followed by the turtle.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.141
Hold your papers up.

39:09.246 --> 39:11.305
Hurry up, girl.

39:11.448 --> 39:13.939
Farrokhi, you collect the papers
on this side.

39:14.051 --> 39:17.111
Be attentive. Remember there'll be
a mathematics class after the break.

39:17.220 --> 39:20.212
Use your time wisely. Do you understand me?

42:05.989 --> 42:07.616
Abel, you're back.

42:35.051 --> 42:37.576
Why are you late today?

42:38.121 --> 42:40.988
And your shoes aren't wet.

42:42.259 --> 42:44.887
Come down here.

42:54.437 --> 42:58.567
Out you go.

43:01.177 --> 43:02.109
Do your hear me?

43:02.245 --> 43:04.509
Come back with your father.

43:04.781 --> 43:08.080
My father is in his office now, sir.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.277
Tell him to come tomorrow. Get moving.

43:10.387 --> 43:13.948
He has to go to his office tomorrow too.

43:15.525 --> 43:16.753
-Come with your mother.

43:16.860 --> 43:19.294
-My mother is ill, sir.

43:19.429 --> 43:20.794
I won't accept any excuses.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.263
You are an irresponsible student.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.368
I cannot tolerate that.

43:25.502 --> 43:27.094
Out you go.

43:34.578 --> 43:39.413
What happened? Why do you cry?

43:49.159 --> 43:50.421
Wait here.

43:55.098 --> 43:56.656
I've heard about...

43:56.833 --> 43:59.666
Ali's been late for school recently.

43:59.869 --> 44:03.202
But he's a good student.

44:06.109 --> 44:08.077
Please don't expel him from school.

44:08.211 --> 44:10.372
Give him a chance.

44:10.480 --> 44:12.072
Come along, Mandegar.

44:18.054 --> 44:21.285
I'll give you one more chance,
for Mr. Jafari's sake.

44:21.391 --> 44:23.518
But this will be the last time.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.619
You may join the class now.

44:29.099 --> 44:29.929
-Thanks, that was very kind of you.

44:30.066 --> 44:31.795
-Don't mention it.

44:48.885 --> 44:51.945
There it is. That's their house.

45:00.964 --> 45:02.693
Abel?

45:03.867 --> 45:12.206
Abel? You are being naughty again.

45:23.153 --> 45:25.087
Here's your box.

45:29.426 --> 45:31.189
Are you going to get the bread?

45:31.361 --> 45:33.352
Don't be late.

46:40.296 --> 46:43.390
Ali, come and serve the tea.

46:43.566 --> 46:46.763
All right, let's go, Amos.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.481
Are you sure you don't need the equipment?

47:05.622 --> 47:08.853
No. Don't worry.

47:09.626 --> 47:12.390
-Thanks a lot. I am grateful.

47:12.562 --> 47:14.723
-Don't mention it.

47:15.498 --> 47:18.695
I don't need the equipment.

47:21.805 --> 47:23.864
Are you sure you can handle it?

47:24.073 --> 47:26.906
Spraying a couple of trees
and ploughing the garden

47:27.110 --> 47:28.907
is not so complicated.

47:29.078 --> 47:31.103
The job does not involve any outlay.

47:31.281 --> 47:32.976
The main thing was to get the equipment

47:33.149 --> 47:35.982
which I got from Hossein.

47:36.085 --> 47:38.383
Hossein works in the northern part of the city

47:38.521 --> 47:40.455
Whenever he can get leave from office.

47:40.623 --> 47:42.955
He earns a lot of money

47:43.092 --> 47:45.754
and he is much better off than we are.

47:45.895 --> 47:47.658
Tomorrow is a holiday,

47:47.797 --> 47:51.198
Ali and I will try our luck up there.

47:51.334 --> 47:55.293
It'll be fun, and we may earn some money.

49:52.021 --> 49:53.386
Let's go.

50:02.165 --> 50:03.723
I'll ring the bells on this side

50:03.866 --> 50:05.060
and you do it on the other side.

50:05.168 --> 50:06.226
Well, what should I say?

50:06.302 --> 50:10.170
Ask if there is any gardening to be done.

50:10.273 --> 50:17.543
Well, come over here and watch me.

50:31.828 --> 50:33.796
-Who is it?
-It's me.

50:33.896 --> 50:36.456
-Who are you?
-Karim.

50:36.699 --> 50:41.193
-Karim? What do you want?
-Nothing, ma'am.

50:41.337 --> 50:47.435
-Who are you? Why do you disturb people?

50:47.577 --> 50:49.204
Sorry!

50:49.312 --> 50:51.143
Parviz, go and see who is it at the door.

50:51.247 --> 50:54.614
Let's go, Ali, run.

50:55.018 --> 50:57.282
Who is it? Wait a minute.

51:07.630 --> 51:09.598
Come down, Ali.

51:13.636 --> 51:17.629
What strange people! What did I tell them?

51:30.987 --> 51:33.421
-Who is it?
-Good day.

51:33.556 --> 51:36.150
-Good day
-Yes, please.

51:36.259 --> 51:39.285
-Who are you?
-Actually my name is Karim.

51:39.462 --> 51:41.487
Well, what do you want?

51:42.398 --> 51:45.026
I am...

51:45.168 --> 51:46.726
We are gardeners, sir.

51:46.903 --> 51:53.399
We spray trees, plough the garden
fertilize the soil and prune branches...

51:53.543 --> 51:56.410
No, we don't need your services.

51:56.579 --> 52:01.642
You did it very well.

52:03.553 --> 52:05.418
Let's go.

52:14.831 --> 52:18.824
-Do you need a gardener?
-No.

52:20.002 --> 52:22.630
-Who is it?
-Do you need a gardener?

52:22.738 --> 52:23.864
No.

52:41.757 --> 52:48.959
Run, Ail. Run.

53:51.794 --> 53:54.786
-Aren't you thirsty?
-No.

53:57.400 --> 54:01.837
Who is it?

54:01.971 --> 54:05.532
Why don't you answer, boy?

54:05.675 --> 54:08.610
Are you gone?

54:09.512 --> 54:12.811
I'm here. Ask your father if there is any
gardening to be done.

54:12.949 --> 54:15.144
-He is not home.
-Ask your mother.

54:15.284 --> 54:16.273
She is not home either.

54:16.419 --> 54:18.580
There is only my grandfather.

54:18.654 --> 54:20.884
Ask your grandfather then.

54:21.190 --> 54:24.648
-Are you a gardener?
-No, but my father is.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.251
-Where is your father?
-Here in the alley.

54:27.363 --> 54:29.524
Will you ask your grandfather
to come to the door?

54:29.665 --> 54:33.260
-First tell me your name.
-My name is Ali.

54:33.436 --> 54:37.770
My name is Alireza. What grade are you in?

54:37.907 --> 54:41.536
Third. Will you now tell your grandfather?

54:41.744 --> 54:43.769
-He is asleep.

54:43.913 --> 54:46.541
-Why didn't you say so right away

54:46.682 --> 54:48.240
Let's go, Ali.

54:48.351 --> 54:51.081
Would you like to come in and play with me?

54:51.220 --> 54:53.484
I have to go. Good bye.

54:53.623 --> 54:55.454
Ali, wait!

54:55.558 --> 54:58.356
Ali, Ali!

55:23.819 --> 55:28.984
I've got a few sacks of fertilizers
which have to be spread at the foot of the trees.

55:29.125 --> 55:31.116
And then there is the spraying to be done.

55:31.260 --> 55:32.352
I'll take care of it.

55:32.495 --> 55:36.124
I neglected to spray the trees last year,

55:36.299 --> 55:38.631
and some of them especially the cherry

55:38.768 --> 55:46.231
and plum trees which I planted with my own hand
have been hurt by plant lice.

55:46.375 --> 55:50.402
Let's go and play, Ali.

55:50.513 --> 55:54.381
Go, son. I'll stay with your father.

55:54.784 --> 55:56.308
Go, dear.

57:04.653 --> 57:06.985
Thanks a lot. Here you are.

57:07.123 --> 57:09.819
-That won't be necessary.
-Please accept.

57:12.161 --> 57:13.219
-That's very generous of you.

57:13.362 --> 57:14.727
-You did a fine job.

57:14.797 --> 57:18.528
-Thanks a lot.
-Don't mention it.

57:18.667 --> 57:22.034
Let's go, Ali.

57:26.976 --> 57:30.742
I'll call now and then to see

57:30.880 --> 57:35.943
if there is anything to be done.

57:39.155 --> 57:40.986
-Good bye.
-Good bye.

57:45.428 --> 57:50.127
I could get leave of absence for a month.

57:50.332 --> 57:52.698
I could make a lot of money here.

57:52.835 --> 57:55.998
This is much better than doing overtime in office.

57:56.138 --> 57:58.732
We could buy a lot of things.

58:00.176 --> 58:06.342
A motorcycle, a cupboard, an electric iron
for your mother,

58:06.515 --> 58:09.814
a large refrigerator.

58:09.952 --> 58:15.049
We could even rent a large house.

58:15.191 --> 58:17.056
And a pair of shoes for Zahra.

58:17.226 --> 58:19.922
And for you.

58:20.062 --> 58:21.120
Zahra comes first.

58:21.263 --> 58:23.493
Her shoes are all torn.

58:23.632 --> 58:25.156
Whatever you say.

58:48.123 --> 58:52.890
-Hold on tightly!
-Stop it, father.

58:53.762 --> 58:58.825
For God's sake, father, stop it!

58:58.968 --> 59:02.836
The brake is out of order. Hold on.

01:00:09.905 --> 01:00:10.769
Mr. Akbar had called again...

01:00:10.906 --> 01:00:13.272
for the rent today.

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:16.845
What an insolent person!

01:00:16.979 --> 01:00:19.812
I told him I would be receiving money

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:22.984
in a couple of days and would pay him

01:00:23.118 --> 01:00:25.177
It is no use talking to him.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:30.623
He waited for about three hours
in the yard to meet you.

01:00:30.759 --> 01:00:34.388
Damn it. I'll go and see him tomorrow.

01:00:34.563 --> 01:00:36.087
But you have not got any money.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:39.291
Trust in God. Don't worry.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:41.300
But how can you go out in your condition?

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:44.600
I am all right.

01:01:13.502 --> 01:01:18.098
Miss, wait a minute! is your pen!

01:01:53.742 --> 01:02:00.113
May I have your attention, boys.

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:06.386
A series of sprint races are to be arranged...

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:09.491
for different age groups in our province.

01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:12.650
We're going to send several students
to the races.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:19.166
The first round of the race has been planned for
3rd and 4th grade students.

01:02:19.334 --> 01:02:22.394
Please refer to the notice board for details.

01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:25.836
The entry prizes are really great.

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:20.724
You dropped it yesterday.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:50.385
-Easy
-See what the man wants, Davud.

01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:55.189
-Hello
-Hello.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.525
What can we do for you?

01:03:57.699 --> 01:03:59.326
I need a pair of shoes for a girl

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.163
at a reasonable price.

01:04:01.303 --> 01:04:02.600
What size?

01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:04.898
I don't remember the size,

01:04:05.073 --> 01:04:06.631
but she's in first grade.

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.785
Here are several models.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.444
Which one do you prefer?

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.217
What color are they?

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.915
One pair is red.

01:04:24.059 --> 01:04:28.462
One is violet with red and yellow buckles.

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.222
Is the price reasonable?

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:32.196
We'll give you a discount.

01:04:32.367 --> 01:04:33.800
This will be fine. Thanks.

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:40.972
It's the salt-seller.

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.510
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:04:42.644 --> 01:04:45.442
-Here you are.
-What do you need?

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:48.880
-I'll take a basket.
-Take it.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.551
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:28.918
Is your house that way?

01:05:29.057 --> 01:05:31.685
Our home is this way.

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:35.961
What pretty shoes! Are they new?

01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:38.099
Yes, my father bought them.

01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:40.565
What did you do with your old shoes?

01:05:40.702 --> 01:05:42.670
My mother threw them away.

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:46.069
Threw them away? Why?

01:05:46.174 --> 01:05:48.734
They were torn.

01:05:58.186 --> 01:06:00.279
My father buys me something nice

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.914
whenever I got top marks.

01:06:03.058 --> 01:06:06.425
And now he's bought me the shoes.

01:07:17.933 --> 01:07:18.957
Why weren't we selected?

01:07:19.134 --> 01:07:20.897
We ran very well, sir.

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:23.800
What is going on here?

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:29.910
I could not select all of you.

01:07:30.078 --> 01:07:32.376
Each school may enter 5 or 6 students
in the race.

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:34.106
Your turn will come next time.

01:07:34.249 --> 01:07:36.513
Get out of the way.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:45.125
They are lucky. Look at the prizes.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:51.358
1st prize: 3 weeks in Ramsar camp,
sport suits.

01:07:53.668 --> 01:07:58.264
2nd prize: 2 weeks in Ramsar camp,
set of stationery.

01:07:58.407 --> 01:08:03.902
3rd prize: 1 week in Ramsar camp,
one pair of sneakers.

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:09.780
One pair of sneakers.

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:17.223
-With your permission.
-Come in.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:24.095
-What is it?
-I want to register for the race, sir.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:28.000
Oh really? But you are too late.

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.497
What kept you so long?

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.698
It slipped my mind, sir.

01:08:34.242 --> 01:08:35.903
You missed your chance this time.

01:08:36.044 --> 01:08:37.305
Maybe next time.

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:41.849
-I want to be in this race.
-Out of the question.

01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:44.247
-Please, sir.
-It is impossible.

01:08:44.352 --> 01:08:45.649
I'd very much like to be in this race, sir.

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:47.779
You should have thought of it before.

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:49.287
You'd have been in the preliminary race.

01:08:49.424 --> 01:08:51.323
It's past the deadline now.

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.258
Let me take part in the race, sir.

01:08:54.362 --> 01:08:55.453
What a stubborn boy.

01:08:55.596 --> 01:08:56.928
I told you it is impossible.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:59.057
Now get out.

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:07.229
I promise to win, sir.

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:10.475
Please let me get in the race.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:14.444
I can beat everybody. I promise to win.

01:09:14.549 --> 01:09:18.144
Please let me get in the race.

01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:25.519
I promise to be number one.

01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:11.571
-Zahra, good news.
-What is it?

01:10:12.574 --> 01:10:16.374
-I am taking part in the race.
-What race?

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:17.843
Sprint race, the day after tomorrow.

01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:23.440
The third best runner gets
a pair of sneakers.

01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:25.416
Why the third?

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:29.787
The first and second prizes are different.

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:38.795
I'll give you the shoes if I end 3rd place.

01:10:38.967 --> 01:10:41.265
But they are boy's shoes.

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:47.399
I could exchange them for girl's shoes.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:50.067
What if you don't end 3rd place?

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:52.942
I'll end 3rd place.

01:11:49.504 --> 01:11:51.369
Help the boys get ready.

01:11:52.173 --> 01:11:53.197
We haven't got much time.

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.275
Get down! Hurry up!

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.275
Come on, boys. Come on.

01:11:58.513 --> 01:12:00.447
Change your clothes.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:20.730
Hurry up, boys.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.390
May I have your attention, boy?

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.966
The race course is 5 kilometer and
the finish line is by the lake.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:55.102
Don't jostle one another.

01:12:55.236 --> 01:12:57.796
Sportsmanship is what counts,

01:12:57.872 --> 01:13:02.036
not winning prizes.

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:05.911
Are you ready? One, two...

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:17.967
Why are you late?

01:16:18.072 --> 01:16:21.235
I'm not late, I ran all the way.

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:22.536
Hurry up! Take off the sneakers.

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.669
I will be late for school.

01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:26.469
The sneakers are dirty.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.105
I 'm ashamed of wearing them.

01:16:28.249 --> 01:16:31.241
I'm not going to wear the sneakers any more.

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:35.015
It's all your fault, you lost the shoes.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:38.354
Find the shoes or I'll tell father.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:42.651
I'll give the sneakers to you
if I end 3rd place.

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:20.129
What if you don't end 3rd place?

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:22.532
I'll end 3rd place.

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:34.686
Well done, Ali!

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:35.921
Did I end 3rd place?

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:37.621
What do you mean 3rd place?

01:20:37.765 --> 01:20:40.791
Your are number one.

01:20:40.968 --> 01:20:43.903
Bravo!

01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:59.212
It doesn't matter. You'll win next.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.770
Get Ali here.

01:21:34.355 --> 01:21:35.845
Look here.

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.818
Look here, please.

01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:44.059
Look here now.

01:21:53.841 --> 01:21:54.671
Please stand off.

01:21:54.742 --> 01:21:57.734
I need a one-shot please.

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.845
Raise your head, champion. Raise it.

01:22:09.523 --> 01:22:11.423
One more.
