Dr. Basu was stabbed five times.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.841
He went into hemorrhagic shock
and bled out.

00:06.924 --> 00:11.011
You tell Bosch he just undid
everything he ever did with a badge.

00:11.095 --> 00:13.055
You just can't admit he was wrong.

00:13.139 --> 00:14.890
Meantime,

00:28.946 --> 00:30.197
Why would they do that?

00:30.281 --> 00:31.657
Raul owes me a favor.

00:31.741 --> 00:32.950
You threatened him.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.452
I did not.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.995
It's a fine line you're walking.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.164

- You know the woman?

00:38.247 --> 00:39.832
She was a photojournalist,

01:40.476 --> 01:44.438
We think they're driving
a stolen white '98 Honda Civic.

01:44.522 --> 01:48.526
Our video canvass has them
entering the 101 South, at Sunset.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.904
As of now, we have no further info
on their present whereabouts.

01:51.987 --> 01:55.533
If you spot the suspects, call it in,
wait for backup, proceed with caution.

01:55.616 --> 01:59.245
These individuals are armed, obviously,
and extremely dangerous.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.538
Any other questions?

02:01.872 --> 02:03.040
How's Calderon?

02:03.624 --> 02:04.750
Stable.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.836

02:22.351 --> 02:23.227
Have you seen her?

02:23.769 --> 02:25.771
Only family until later this afternoon.

02:26.689 --> 02:27.731
Tell her we'll see her soon.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.816
Will do.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.528
How'd it go with the family?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.488
I didn't know what to say.

02:34.572 --> 02:36.073
Dorsey did most of the talking.

02:36.866 --> 02:40.160
I just kept saying
she's gonna be all right.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.121
Hold that thought.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.664
I'll try.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.749
Rogers has left the country.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.046
- Is he returning?
- No idea.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.841
When we've discussed this man, it's...

02:55.092 --> 02:57.720
it's elicited some powerful emotions.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.180
Yes. All-consuming.

03:02.391 --> 03:06.562
But to be honest, with him
no longer in the picture, I, uh...

03:09.106 --> 03:12.985
I was hoping things
would feel differently.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.653
In what way?

03:16.655 --> 03:21.035
I've been so disoriented.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.119
Um...

03:25.456 --> 03:27.207
I just feel like I've lost...

I've lost my sense of myself.
You know, me.

03:31.629 --> 03:32.630

03:33.380 --> 03:35.215

03:36.634 --> 03:37.635
And...

03:39.887 --> 03:41.805
I-I guess I really thought getting

rid of him would fix things.

Please tell me that you and your former
client had nothing to do with this.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.783
I had nothing to do with it.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.451
Nor do I know who did.

- And if the FBI come knocking on my door?
- Why would they?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.748
Do I tell them about
your conversation with Datz,

06:54.832 --> 06:56.208
or that you threatened him?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.127
I warned him this might happen,

06:58.210 --> 07:01.338
and I offered to intercede
with Raúl Arraya on his behalf.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.549
But the threat was implicit in the offer.

07:03.632 --> 07:06.051

14:07.806 --> 14:09.099
Is your dog friendly?

14:10.183 --> 14:13.144
- Yeah.
- Hey, pup. Hi.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.188
Live around here?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.815
Just walkin' the dog.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.776
Same time every night?
After practice?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.987
Pretty much. How'd you know?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.613
You're an athlete. Obviously.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.283
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah. Duh.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.493
My name's Bosch,
I'm a private investigator.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.328
I'm looking into the death of Dr. Basu.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.413
The doctor who got stabbed.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.124
Yeah, were you out here that night?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.208
Yeah.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.669
- Did you talk to the police?
- They interviewed me.

14:38.003 --> 14:38.878
What'd you tell them?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.798
Told 'em I saw a guy
in a hoodie running away.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.383
Could you ID him?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.010
I didn't see his face.

14:45.093 --> 14:45.969
What about the hoodie?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.180
Dark. With the Baylor Bear on the front.

14:49.806 --> 14:50.890
Kinda hard to miss.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.768
Why didn't you share that detail
with the police?

14:53.852 --> 14:54.769
I did.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.938
It wasn't in the interview notes.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.357
What can I say? I told the cop.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.528
- Detective. Whatever.
- No, I believe you. Did you get a name?

15:04.112 --> 15:05.280
Tall, skinny dude.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.157
Kinda like Ichabod Crane.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.368
You know?
Sleepy Hollow, Johnny Depp?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.871
- Gustafson?
- Sounds right.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.542
- You have a good night.
- You as well.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.429
I think they were listening in.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.555
Who was listening in?

15:30.639 --> 15:32.724
The intel unit at Terminal Island.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.684
How else would those two FBI agents know

15:34.768 --> 15:37.646
the particulars of
my conversation with Datz?

15:37.729 --> 15:42.025
That's a major constitutional violation,
bugging an attorney client room.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.402
Not only illegally gathering information

15:44.486 --> 15:46.738
but sharing that information with the FBI.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.616
That information would certainly be
inadmissible at your trial,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.409
should it come to that.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.494
My trial?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.120
Speaking hypothetically.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.246
I mean, if push came to shove.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.417
Marty. I-I did not cross any red line.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.836
Kidding. I'm kidding.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.798
God, you had me going.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.384
Although, you must admit

16:07.467 --> 16:10.261
that you tip-toed right up to it.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.390
- Goodnight, Marty.
- [Marty] Night.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.193
[Chandler on phone] You may be
getting a visit from the FBI.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.152
Why?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.862
They dropped by here yesterday,

16:27.946 --> 16:29.656
wanted to know about
our meeting with Datz

16:29.739 --> 16:32.283
and what I had to say about Raúl Arraya.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.410
[Bosch]
How do they know about Arraya?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.494
[Chandler] How do you think?

16:34.577 --> 16:35.578
Fucking Feds.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.163
[Chandler]
Whatever you do, don't lie.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.042
Lying to the FBI is a crime
and a common mistake.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.252
Just say "lawyer."

16:42.335 --> 16:45.255
Yeah yeah yeah,
it's not my first rodeo, Counselor.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.172
Good to know.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.623
Momma, stop a minute.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.251
I'm okay, I'm safe.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.003
[Mrs. Davis]
Nicole, is he hurtin' you?

17:25.628 --> 17:28.339
No, I'm just scared.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.722
He needs cash to get away.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.974
I need you to go get him some
so I can come home.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.101
[Mrs. Davis]
He's not getting a penny.

17:41.102 --> 17:45.440
Please. Kalon and I
aren't safe while he's around.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.818
I gotta go. Love you, Momma.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.538
Is there anyone he may have
had a conflict with,

18:00.622 --> 18:02.123
a colleague, a patient?

18:04.542 --> 18:06.503
I worked with him at the clinic.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.671
He got along with everyone.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.591
Did you notice any change
in his daily patterns?

18:11.674 --> 18:15.303
Did he seem, I don't know,
preoccupied in any way?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.809
I mean, no more than usual.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.685
He always had a lot on his mind.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.770
Enough.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.107
- We have nothing more to say to you.
- Amma!

18:28.191 --> 18:30.902
Mrs. Basu, I'm so very sorry.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.570
Have I said something that's offended you?

18:32.654 --> 18:35.323
This person is the reason why
your father's killer was released.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.449
Amma, that's not true.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.867
That's what the detective said.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.787
Excuse me, Mrs. Basu,
they arrested the wrong man.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.956
The police think otherwise.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.958
Why do you say they had the wrong man?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.418
DNA evidence. Eyewitness testimony.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.838
This lead detective, this Gustafson,

18:50.547 --> 18:52.048
he didn't follow up, Mrs. Basu.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.968
Amma, what if he's right?

18:55.051 --> 18:57.136
What if the police missed something?

19:17.282 --> 19:20.785
Did he mention a meeting with a medical
board investigator earlier this summer?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.287
I don't think so, no.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.098
[sighs] Preeda.

19:45.810 --> 19:47.186
What are you doing here?

19:47.270 --> 19:48.646
I'm scared.

19:49.606 --> 19:50.982
Is this the same man?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.402
I don't know. It's not our case.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.363
Can you at least tell me how
the investigation is going?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.826
I can't talk about it.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.953
You're gonna have to reach out
to Detective Coleman.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.455
I've tried.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.708
I leave her messages,
but she doesn't call me back.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.629
I haven't heard anything new from her
since the day it happened.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.049
It takes time to build a case.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.550
How much time?

20:20.929 --> 20:22.847
We're all just stretched a little thin.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.098
An officer was shot two days ago.

20:24.182 --> 20:26.225
We're all hands on deck here
trying to find the shooter.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.482
I see.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.126
Harry Bosch?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.962
Who wants to know?

20:54.295 --> 20:56.214
FBI. We'd like a word with you.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.007
Okay, lads.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.931
Have your word.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.766
What did Honey Chandler
want from Willy Datz?

21:06.849 --> 21:08.351
You'd have to ask her about that.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.061
What'd the three of you talk about?

21:10.812 --> 21:11.980
They talked. I listened.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.106
Datz is dead.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.399
Yeah, I read the papers.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.151
We think Chandler's client Raúl Arraya
had something to do with it.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.861
I wouldn't know anything about that.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.154
Did she threaten Datz?

21:21.239 --> 21:22.782
[sighs] Define threaten.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.659
That Raúl Arraya owed her a favor.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.079
I don't remember what
Chandler said to him exactly.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.206
I'd hate to misquote her.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.417
Let's go for a ride.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.752
- Seriously?
- Jog your memory.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.797
- I'll follow you.
- You can ride with us.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.510
You're gonna bring me
back here? Hmm?

21:43.511 --> 21:45.013
You gonna spring for carfare?

21:47.348 --> 21:50.184
Nicole had nothing to do
with that shooting.

21:50.268 --> 21:51.519
She wasn't even there.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.062
But now she's an accessory.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.397
He forced her.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.065
Have you heard from her?

22:01.029 --> 22:02.530
She called yesterday.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.199
What did she say?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.705
You have got to swear that
you're gonna keep her safe.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.874
I will do everything I can, Mrs. Davis.

22:16.753 --> 22:18.421
He needs money to get out of town.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.133
She's only helping him so
she can come home and be with Kalon.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.092
Who?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.391
Is Sharp the boy's father?

22:30.475 --> 22:32.143
No relation.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.733
Ok, we're gonna set up a cash drop.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.526
Now, the next time she calls,

22:40.610 --> 22:43.488
tell her Sharp can pick up the money
himself and leave town.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.785
Plug this into your phone.

22:50.369 --> 22:54.123
And when she calls,
just press that button and it records.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.920
Please, Mrs. Davis, for your daughter.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.547
And your grandson.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.518
I did not put out a hit out on Datz.

23:14.519 --> 23:17.396
Well, the Feds think you did,
and that I put you up to it.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.899
What gave them that idea?

23:21.275 --> 23:23.694
I told Datz you owed me a favor.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.697
Did it work?

23:27.490 --> 23:29.325
He told me what I wanted to know.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.411
You slick, Counselor.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.958
No, somehow the Feds got wind of it.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.127
The Feds are full of shit.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.545
Any idea?

23:42.046 --> 23:42.922
No.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.716
And I wouldn't tell you if I did.

23:46.676 --> 23:50.471
I like you, Money, but I ain't no snitch.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.268
What's the chatter?

23:55.351 --> 23:56.519
About Datz?

23:59.772 --> 24:02.733
Chatter is the Russians
weren't too happy with him.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.445
Chatter is Bratva
put a bounty on his head.

24:07.697 --> 24:08.948
Why? For what?

24:09.532 --> 24:10.867
For talking to you.

24:12.243 --> 24:15.204
Got some expendable moron
to do the hit and take the fall.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.914
For talking to me.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.126
That's the word, hummingbird.

24:46.736 --> 24:48.196
What'd they pick you up for?

24:48.279 --> 24:50.114
Pricks were trying to
squeeze me for information.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.283
Detained me for the whole afternoon

24:52.366 --> 24:54.285
and asked me the same
fucking questions over and over.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.078
They succeed?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.496
What do you think?

24:57.580 --> 24:59.624
Oh, I think you're an O.G., brah.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.500
[phone vibrates]

25:06.380 --> 25:08.424
[Lewis on recording]
Mr. Bosch, Halley Lewis here.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.886
I still don't remember the name of
Dominick's lady friend,

25:11.969 --> 25:15.681
but I remembered the name of the paper
she worked for. La Raza.

25:17.225 --> 25:18.142
Got something?

25:19.393 --> 25:20.394
Drive.

25:30.363 --> 25:31.239
[car door closes]

25:38.412 --> 25:39.372
Hello?

25:40.581 --> 25:41.540
Ida Porter.

25:42.124 --> 25:42.959
Good morning.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.419
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

25:45.503 --> 25:47.171
Philip Corwin. Advance Engineering.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.924
Oh, Mr. Corwin. Of course.

25:50.675 --> 25:51.676
Please come in.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.641
May I offer you a coffee?

25:59.517 --> 26:00.393
Glass of water?

26:01.477 --> 26:02.937
Uh, no. Thank you.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.523
What can I do for you Mr. Corwin?

26:05.606 --> 26:07.233
Just making the rounds.

26:07.316 --> 26:10.861
Wanted to check in with
Whitney's inner circle.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.282
You're letting me go, aren't you?

26:17.243 --> 26:20.288
We at Advance Engineering
will always be grateful

26:20.371 --> 26:21.956
for your dedicated service.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.582
Forty years.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.334
And you're sacking me.

26:26.335 --> 26:29.630
With Whitney gone, there's really
no place for the mansion staff.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.426
Cook, Mr. Sloan--
you're letting them all go?

26:33.509 --> 26:35.761
We're keeping Sloan as
a member of the security team.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.888
But otherwise, yes,

26:37.972 --> 26:39.765
we're furloughing the rest of the staff.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.644
Think of it as a well-deserved,

26:43.728 --> 26:46.022
long overdue, extended vacation.

26:47.565 --> 26:48.399
Vacation.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.485
With a generous severance package.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.002
Detective Coleman.

27:09.211 --> 27:11.881
Officer Bosch. You worked my scene.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.841
That's right. Preeda Saetang.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.468
Are you here on that case?

27:15.551 --> 27:16.927
Not that one, no.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.637
The Anise Sahagun case.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.264
The attempted in Thai Town?

27:20.348 --> 27:21.557
That's the one.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.017
Have you seen this?

27:23.100 --> 27:24.643
The Neighborhood App?

27:24.727 --> 27:26.645
There's reports of similar break-ins.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.356
Nothing stolen, cut window screens.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.648
I've seen these.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.318
Assailant entered through
the cut door or window screen.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.652
Plenty of DNA.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.071
He's never used a condom.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.573
Several of the cases have been linked,
but no match in the CODIS database.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.741
So, he doesn't have a record.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.454
If I need units for the neighborhood
canvass on the Sahagun case,

27:43.537 --> 27:44.955
are you and your partner down?

27:45.664 --> 27:46.749
All the way.

27:49.377 --> 27:52.254
They just found the inmate
that killed Datz.

27:52.338 --> 27:53.839
I just heard it on KNX.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.926
They tossed the cellblock
and found the shiv in the cell.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.386
Who was it?

27:58.469 --> 28:01.889
I didn't catch the last name.
Gregor or something.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.601
So, not one of Arraya's guys.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.186
Apparently not.

28:09.146 --> 28:10.523
I appreciate it.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.402
Davis just called her mother.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.988
Sharp's grabbing the cash himself
from the Lemon Grove Rec Center.

28:18.072 --> 28:19.073
Time?

28:19.156 --> 28:21.075
This afternoon. Four p.m.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.204
My source says Davis
is being held against her will.

28:25.287 --> 28:28.707
She's only aiding Sharp
so she can get back to her kid alive.

28:28.791 --> 28:31.293
Looks an awful lot like
aiding and abetting to me.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.422
- Who's your source?
- Her mother.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.425
- Detective--
- I know, I just want to make sure

28:37.508 --> 28:39.301
we do what we can to keep her safe.

28:39.969 --> 28:40.928
Of course.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.848
No collateral damage, if we can avoid it.

28:50.938 --> 28:53.899
When Sharp arrives for the money drop,
I'll make visual confirmation,

28:53.983 --> 28:56.944
and then SIS
and Metro units will converge.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.362
Vasquez, Bosch.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.949
You'll set up at Marathon and Kingsley

29:02.032 --> 29:03.159
as a secondary, outer perimeter.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.786
If a vehicle pursuit ensues,
get your butts over there.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.289
SIS will relinquish their position.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.249
- You guys will be secondary.
- Roger that.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.639
Coppers? LAPD?

29:25.723 --> 29:26.974
Simi Valley PD.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.852
I'm Detective Poydras,
this is Detective Franks.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.687
Long way from home.
What's this about?

29:31.770 --> 29:32.813
Whitney Vance.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.941
- What about him?
- You visited him twice at his estate.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.026
What about?

29:37.109 --> 29:39.778
He paid me ten grand to try to
find someone for him.

29:39.862 --> 29:40.779
Who?

29:42.656 --> 29:46.035
Ok, here's how this is gonna go.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.664
How about you tell me
how Vance was killed,

29:50.748 --> 29:52.458
and I'll tell you who he hired me to find.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.626
[chuckles]

29:54.293 --> 29:55.294
How do you know that?

29:55.377 --> 29:59.590
Ventura Coroner is still ruling it
as suspicious. Am I right?

29:59.673 --> 30:02.301
That's not how it works.
We ask the questions.

30:02.384 --> 30:05.513
Really. No professional courtesy, huh?

30:05.596 --> 30:06.722
You're not a detective.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.308
One call to Sacramento,
we pull your PI license.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.269
Guys, come on. Tranquillo .

30:13.354 --> 30:16.815
Vance hired me to find one of
his old roomies from USC. That's it.

30:16.899 --> 30:17.858
Name?

30:17.942 --> 30:21.529
Don't know. Was almost seventy years ago,
the old man couldn't remember.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.489
He and his friend,
they got into some trouble,

30:23.572 --> 30:25.407
friend takes the rap for Vance.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.536
Next semester,
Vance transfers to Cal Tech.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.664
He never sees the roomie again.
He just wanted to make amends.

30:31.747 --> 30:32.748
Kinda fucking late.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.626
Who else knows you were hired to do this?

30:35.709 --> 30:37.336
Well, according to Vance nobody.

30:38.379 --> 30:39.672
But David Sloan,

30:39.755 --> 30:41.674
he came here once,
to see what I was up to.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.343
His head of security came here.

30:44.426 --> 30:45.427
Like I said...

30:46.554 --> 30:48.347
he tells me Vance sent him.

30:50.266 --> 30:53.435
If you're not looking at Sloan,
you should be.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.574
[archivist] I'm just warning you
it'll take longer than you think.

31:06.657 --> 31:08.784
Ten years of La Raza archives,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.286
twenty-five thousand photographs.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.495
[Bosch] Only one photographer.

31:11.579 --> 31:14.164
There we go.
That makes things much easier.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.207
What's the name?

31:15.833 --> 31:17.418
That's what I was hoping to find out.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.921
Degree of difficulty just spiked again.

31:21.005 --> 31:24.258
This photographer took a photo
back in '72 of someone I know.

31:24.341 --> 31:25.718
I was hoping to find her that way.

31:27.011 --> 31:30.973
The Chicano Pride movement was massive
in Southern California.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.976
Protests, parties, meet-ups, marches.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.645
Got anything else
that could narrow the search?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.147
Can't think of any.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.524
- Vaya con Dios.
- [chuckles]

33:08.904 --> 33:10.531
[children laughing]

33:29.508 --> 33:31.802
I have positive ID on Target Two.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.683
She's on foot,
entering the park from Hobart.

33:37.766 --> 33:38.809
No sign of Target One.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.486
Does anybody have eyes on Target One?

33:50.487 --> 33:51.864
Negative.

33:54.575 --> 33:55.826
I have Target One.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.455
Southbound Hobart.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.466
Meeting with Target Two.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.762
Target Two has the package,
she's leaving the park.

34:16.805 --> 34:18.265
Meeting Target One.

34:20.017 --> 34:21.185
[Sharp] Let's go, get in.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.103
Get in the fucking car.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.272
Get in the fucking car now.
Get over there.

34:28.275 --> 34:30.152
Let's go, we gotta go, get in.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.070
[Cosgrove over radio]
Target Two is entering the vehicle.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.117
All units be advised,
I am behind Targets One and Two.

34:37.201 --> 34:38.368
Initiate the stop.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.541
[tires squeal]

34:46.502 --> 34:48.462
Fourteen. We are in pursuit.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.130
Eastbound Lemon Grove from Hobart.

34:50.214 --> 34:53.175
White Code 37 vehicle
with attempted 187 suspects.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.511
Radio discipline.
Stay the fuck off the air

34:55.594 --> 34:56.970
[engine starts]

34:57.054 --> 35:00.349
[siren blares]

35:16.615 --> 35:18.659
Sharp, show me your hands.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.416
Gun, gun, gun--

35:31.296 --> 35:33.799
[car alarm rings]

35:57.364 --> 35:58.490

[indistinct radio chatter]

36:32.357 --> 36:33.984
LT. What happened here?

36:34.610 --> 36:36.445
Sharp and Davis tried to escape.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.447
They crashed, we surrounded them.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.032
Sharp went for his gun.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.791
Miss Gabriela. Mine isn't working.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.085
You have to advance it, mija, remember?

36:52.628 --> 36:55.172
Advance-- yes,
advance the film, there you go.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.716
Gabriela Lida.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.259
Yes?

37:00.344 --> 37:02.763
Haven't seen this photo in a long time.

37:02.846 --> 37:03.889
He looks very happy.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.474
We were head over heels.

37:07.935 --> 37:11.605
Oh! [chuckles]
He must have taken this one.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.023
Never saw it before.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.568
- Where'd you find it?
- His sister's garage.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.488
All these years later.

37:19.947 --> 37:21.281
What's your daughter's name?

37:22.282 --> 37:24.284
Vibiana Veracruz.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.120
Vibiana after Nicky's mother.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.584
This photo is right after
we were married on the beach.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.503
We weren't formally married.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.630
My friend who officiated was a bruja .

37:37.214 --> 37:40.258
Bruja? Like a witch, right?

37:41.093 --> 37:43.303
It seems silly, I know.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.430
But we just wanted to commit to each other

37:45.514 --> 37:49.059
and thought we'd get married legally
when Nicky returned.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.019
That doesn't seem silly.

37:52.729 --> 37:54.064
I have to ask you,

37:55.107 --> 37:57.985
why doesn't Dominick's sister
know about Vibiana?

37:58.068 --> 37:59.236
About you?

37:59.319 --> 38:01.738
[laughs] I was afraid.

38:01.822 --> 38:03.699
A freelance photographer?

38:05.033 --> 38:06.243
I had no money.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.122
And I thought that
the Santanellos could win in court

38:10.205 --> 38:11.707
and take her from me.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.669
I was in youth homes as a boy.
Foster care.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.214
The whole time I was in the system,

38:19.297 --> 38:21.633
my mother was fighting...

38:21.717 --> 38:23.093
to get me back.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.264
Did she? Get you back?

38:28.849 --> 38:31.852
Few months here, few months there.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.604
She died when I was 12.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.945
So, you were alone since you were 12?

38:44.531 --> 38:45.532
Pobre.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.411
I'd like to meet Vibiana.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.999
There's some things I need to discuss with
her regarding her grandfather.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.169
Nicky's biological father.

38:57.836 --> 38:58.837
Correct.

39:00.714 --> 39:02.799
She's down in the Arts District.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.635
Not far from here. I can take you.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.638
If I could just get her address?

39:08.722 --> 39:13.060
Mm, best if I'm there to watch over
Gilberto while you two talk.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.228
Gilberto?

39:16.313 --> 39:17.314
My grandson.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.274
Vibby's boy.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.319
Sweetest kid. Just turned 14.

39:24.321 --> 39:26.406
- [Gabriela] We'll find the time.
- [Bosch] Sooner the better.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.533
You still haven't told me
who Nicky's father is.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.952
Next time. Promise.
