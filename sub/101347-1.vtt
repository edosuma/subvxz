WEBVTT

02:38.825 --> 02:40.285
Don't be scared.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.832
Do not worry.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.298
Who are you?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.800
I am the angel of peace.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.511
The angel of Portugal.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.899
Look.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.847
And they don't seem
to want to stop.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.942
Manuel!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.362
Manuel!

04:12.794 --> 04:14.087
We should pray.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.221
I believe.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.056
I believe.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.224
I have hope.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.391
I have hope.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.768
And I love God.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.436
I love God.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.438
I love God.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.899
Pray for peace.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.860
Thank you.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.160
Professor Nichols.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.369
- Yes.
- Welcome.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.131
Please have a seat.
She will join us soon.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.966
Thank you.

06:48.534 --> 06:51.745
Good morning, Sister Lucia.

06:51.787 --> 06:56.083
Of Jesus
and of the Immaculate Heart.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.417
Yes.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.297
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me today.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.757
I really appreciate it.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.470
I couldn't imagine my book
completed without you.

07:08.512 --> 07:12.808
I just read and very much appreciated
your last work.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.142
- Thank you.
- Although...

07:15.519 --> 07:17.980
I don't share most of your views.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.315
No, I suppose you do not.

07:20.357 --> 07:25.654
In your last paper, you wrote,
"All seers are de facto unstable."

07:25.696 --> 07:27.739
I didn't mean to offend you.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.368
On the contrary,
I've always been fascinated

07:31.410 --> 07:35.122
by opinions opposed to my own.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.082
Well, then we do have
something in common.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.712
I have so many questions,
Sister Lucia.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.465
But let me start
with the most obvious one.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.135
If someone were to say to you now

07:48.844 --> 07:51.680
why what happened
all those years ago

07:51.722 --> 07:54.183
had to have happened to you
of all people...

07:55.225 --> 07:56.810
how would you respond?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.147
Because it was necessary.

08:01.690 --> 08:02.941
Necessary?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.110
To spread her message.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.031
At the time, naturally,

08:09.948 --> 08:14.494
I could not have imagined
its importance

08:14.536 --> 08:16.163
nor the consequences.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.877
I was a child.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.008
And do you have any regrets?

08:31.803 --> 08:36.015
Does it look like the world
has heard the message of heavenly peace?

08:36.558 --> 08:37.808
Hmm.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.355
This is my only regret.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.359
That I haven't done enough
to please my mother.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.195
Which mother?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.156
The Holy Mother?

09:19.351 --> 09:21.270
Almeido, Julio.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.605
22nd Battalion.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.899
Deceased.

09:27.609 --> 09:31.238

09:32.239 --> 09:33.991

09:34.950 --> 09:37.077

09:48.255 --> 09:50.090

10:03.020 --> 10:07.691
Goncalves, Mario, 7th Battalion.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.775
Deceased.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.445
Oh, no.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.405
Oh, no.

10:13.447 --> 10:16.200
- ...34th Battalion. Deceased.
- No.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.037
Oh, no.

10:20.078 --> 10:24.249
Lopez, Alfredo.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.126
34th Battalion.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463

Martinez, Fernando.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.889

10:40.140 --> 10:42.726
Holy Virgin Mary,
Mother of all Mothers.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.646
Please don't let him say his name.

10:47.064 --> 10:51.443
I promise I will work
much harder for the church

10:52.319 --> 10:53.612
and to spread faith.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.989
As a family...

10:57.824 --> 10:59.993
we are to carry out many penances.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.664
Our home will be an example
for the church.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.125
- We will do this for God.
- 22nd Battalion.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.294
- But please...
- Missing.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.172
...let Manuel come home safe.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.343
7th Battalion. Deceased.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.641
Rodrigues, Luis. 34th Battalion.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.351
Deceased.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.023
Please, God.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.489
Silva, José.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.367
34th Battalion. Deceased.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.369
They didn't call out Santos.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.372
Sousa, Augusto.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.208
22nd Battalion.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.544
Missing in action.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.354
Well, hello, sweethearts.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.566
What are you doing here?

12:14.151 --> 12:16.361
I told him to go
with Father Ferreira.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.863
Ah. Good girl.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.615
I will go.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.911
- Oh, beautiful.
- Thank you, Mama.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.704
Fernanda, look.

12:25.746 --> 12:27.039
Thank you. So nice.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.290
It's nice, isn't it?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.742
My son!

13:04.660 --> 13:06.286
Ma.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.920
We must be proud of them.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.632
These young men are fighting
to keep our country's honor high.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.052
But they also defend our republic.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.096
They defend our progressive ideas

13:24.137 --> 13:26.223
that will free our country
from a feudal past

13:26.265 --> 13:28.934
created by ignorance
and religious superstitions.

13:30.978 --> 13:35.107
We must all follow the example
of Nuno and Ernesto.

13:39.361 --> 13:42.906
Your Lenten fast is over, isn't it?
Let us make a toast to their honor.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.367
Joaquim, I'm buying a round of drinks
for everyone. <i>Música!</i>

13:51.999 --> 13:53.292
Francisco!

14:06.763 --> 14:09.308
- Lucia, come with me.
- Why?

14:09.349 --> 14:13.312
I told you this morning.
It's time we pray and ask for forgiveness.

14:14.146 --> 14:15.480
She was only dancing.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.233
We promised the Holy Virgin,
for Manuel.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.737
I don't think either God
or the Holy Virgin

14:21.778 --> 14:25.073
will be upset
if a young girl is dancing.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.995
I promised we'd be sacrificing ourselves
to get him home.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.461
Yeah.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.889
Francisco. Come and dance. Come.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.991
Lucia! Lucia!

15:50.284 --> 15:52.286
We brought you a treat!

15:52.327 --> 15:54.955
I was hoping you'd come.
I'm starving.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.501
But... my mother says
a little hunger is good for the soul.

15:59.543 --> 16:00.961
Especially now.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.963
Is Auntie still angry with you?

16:03.964 --> 16:06.758
You did nothing wrong.
You were only dancing.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.468
Yes, I know that.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.138
But Mama is scared for Manuel.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.182
What does that
have to do with you?

16:14.516 --> 16:17.269
Mama says I must atone
to make him come home.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.816
Come on, let's go.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.861
Let's pray like we did last time!

16:37.164 --> 16:39.166
Ave!

16:42.377 --> 16:46.340
- Maria!
- Maria!

16:49.635 --> 16:50.928
How many did you hear?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.013
I don't know. Maybe three.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.852
Ave!

16:59.311 --> 17:02.314
- Maria!
- Maria!

17:03.690 --> 17:06.608
Did you see that?

17:06.652 --> 17:07.819
- What?
- Was it lightning?

17:07.861 --> 17:09.530
We must go. It's going to rain.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.823
But the sun is shining.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.409
- Help me gather the sheep.
- But I didn't see any lightning.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.968
Come on.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.178
Come on! Come on!
We have to go home!

17:33.220 --> 17:35.305
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go home.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.723
Come on, let's go home.

17:36.765 --> 17:37.891
- Let's go!
- We need to go!

17:37.933 --> 17:40.435
Another one.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.232
Look.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.796
Who are you?
Where do you come from?

18:50.964 --> 18:52.299
Who are you talking to?

18:52.341 --> 18:54.843
- Can't you see her?
- No.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.095
- Enough of this joke.
- Shh!

19:00.182 --> 19:01.642
I come from heaven.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.148
Are you seriously from heaven?

19:08.190 --> 19:09.816
Will I go to heaven?

19:13.737 --> 19:15.322
I can see her now.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.283
What about Jacinta?

19:19.201 --> 19:20.327
Also.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.956
- And Francisco?
- What?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.165
Same. But...

19:30.337 --> 19:31.630
What did she say?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.343
I'll tell you later.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.557
Our friend, Maria Das Neves.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.059
She's in heaven.

19:51.650 --> 19:55.028
Why did you come?
What do you want from us?

19:57.698 --> 19:59.825
You must come back here,

20:00.701 --> 20:03.704
every month at this time,

20:03.745 --> 20:06.123
for the next six months.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.300
Pray the rosary every day...

20:17.384 --> 20:19.803
to bring peace to the world...

20:21.221 --> 20:23.182
and to end the war.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.228
The world needs peace.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.537
I want to know
what she said about me.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.825
Did you tell her
about the rosary?

21:23.867 --> 21:25.160
No.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.372
So, she said
I need to pray the rosary more.

21:28.413 --> 21:32.584
She knows everything,
even our most personal things.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.461
Are you sure
she's not angry at me?

21:34.503 --> 21:38.006
I told you not to throw stones
at the boys from Boleiros.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.676
Do you think that's the reason
why I couldn't hear her?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.594
- Sure it is.
- But they beat me up.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.638
- I try to run away...
- Stop it.

21:47.391 --> 21:49.977
So, what do we do now?

21:51.019 --> 21:53.105
She said we have to suffer.

21:53.814 --> 21:54.815
Why?

21:55.649 --> 21:58.193
I didn't quite understand.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.696
What are we doing wrong?

22:05.117 --> 22:07.744
I can't wait
to tell Mama and Papa.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.204
- We can't tell anyone!
- We can't tell anyone!

22:09.997 --> 22:12.416
But she said
we were her messengers.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.670
She came to us.
It's our secret.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.933
It is a sin
to use God's name in vain.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.144
Do I need to say
making lies up?

22:32.186 --> 22:34.521
- Give her time to explain.
- Forgive me.

22:35.063 --> 22:38.025
I didn't mean to tell them, but...

22:38.066 --> 22:39.151
But it's true, Mama.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.321
She was so beautiful.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.032
And as real as you are.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.327
She was sad about the war.

22:49.328 --> 22:51.830
But she said
she loves us so much.

22:51.872 --> 22:55.042
And she'll be back every month
around midday.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.962
It wasn't just me who saw her.
We all did.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.966
Yes, but I couldn't hear her though.

23:03.008 --> 23:05.052
What if they are telling the truth?

23:08.472 --> 23:09.556
The truth?

23:10.724 --> 23:12.476
How can you be so sure?

23:13.477 --> 23:16.188
A few days ago,
Lucy said she'd seen an angel,

23:16.230 --> 23:17.689
and Manuel wounded.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.650
Auntie, it is the truth.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.735
We saw her.

23:22.528 --> 23:24.530
And we didn't imagine it.

23:26.615 --> 23:30.494
Hmm. Did she say
she was the Holy Virgin?

23:30.536 --> 23:32.538
She came from heaven.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.831
- Did she say that?
- No.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.625
She did not say who she was.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.670
- It could have been someone else.
- It was her.

23:39.711 --> 23:43.090
Why would the Mother of God
choose you of all people?

23:44.049 --> 23:46.218
- What's so special about you?
- Maria.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.970
How can she be
so full of herself?

23:48.804 --> 23:52.015
António, you don't understand.
At first, it was an angel.

23:52.057 --> 23:54.726
And then Manuel.
Now it's the Mother of God.

23:57.104 --> 23:59.189
She must stop lying
just to get our attention.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.691
I'm not lying!

24:12.077 --> 24:14.162
But maybe...

24:18.083 --> 24:19.126
I don't know.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.460
She was real.

24:22.171 --> 24:23.755
Lucia. Lucia!

24:23.797 --> 24:25.048
Wait, wait, wait.

24:29.011 --> 24:31.638
It's getting late. We better go.

24:32.723 --> 24:34.558
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have read

24:34.600 --> 24:37.519
<i>The Virgin's Appearance
to the Little Shepherds of Salette.</i>

24:38.645 --> 24:39.813
Good night.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.398
Good night.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.194
Jacinta, wait.

24:50.991 --> 24:52.826
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:05.506 --> 25:07.132
Francisco, Jacinta.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.434
Jacinta, who is younger than me...

25:18.352 --> 25:19.895
was much braver.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.649
Please forgive me. I was scared.

25:25.025 --> 25:27.027
I really want to see you again.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.786
Lucia, is everything all right?

26:00.102 --> 26:01.353
Do you believe them?

26:06.900 --> 26:08.110
I wouldn't know.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.534
They've never told lies.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.467
Thank you. Oh, Father.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.053
Thank you so much
for getting in touch with me.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.097
Lucia told me everything.

26:38.891 --> 26:42.936
Forgive me, Father.
I don't know what happened to Lucia.

26:42.978 --> 26:47.357
She's always had a bright imagination,
but she seems to have gone too far.

26:47.399 --> 26:49.985
And I've already told you,
it is a sin to tell lies.

26:50.027 --> 26:51.445
It goes against God.

26:52.196 --> 26:54.281
Now tell the truth
and ask for forgiveness.

26:54.323 --> 26:57.576
It is no lie. We saw her.

26:57.618 --> 26:59.912
And she told us to come back
to see her again.

26:59.953 --> 27:02.581
When is this going to end?
I'm sorry.

27:03.457 --> 27:04.958
Why don't we agree for now

27:05.000 --> 27:08.337
and accept that what you are saying
is the truth?

27:09.630 --> 27:13.425
How can you be so sure
that the lady you saw was the Virgin Mary?

27:16.261 --> 27:17.930
I just do.

27:18.931 --> 27:24.019
You know, Lucia, someone may
have wanted to play a trick on you.

27:25.646 --> 27:28.607
Or worse.
It could have been the devil.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.903
Sometimes the devil likes to tempt
young souls like yours.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.780
He often disguises himself,

27:34.821 --> 27:37.616
at times even through
reassuring shapes,

27:37.658 --> 27:39.326
as a way to hide his evil.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.205
Thank you, Father.

27:43.247 --> 27:44.331
Excuse me.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.085
It would be wise
to forbid Lucia and her cousins

27:48.126 --> 27:49.545
to return to that place.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.881
Do you really think
she had a vision of the devil?

27:53.841 --> 27:56.343
Even if it was a figment
of her imagination...

27:57.344 --> 27:59.972
if word gets out,
considering the time we live in,

28:00.013 --> 28:01.849
it could be dangerous.

28:01.890 --> 28:05.102
Anything related to religion
is ill-received by many.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.020
Thank you, Father.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.690
Come on. Let's go home.

29:02.492 --> 29:03.952
Lucia.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.293
Is it you?

29:12.461 --> 29:14.087
Come here.

30:24.449 --> 30:27.494
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

30:27.536 --> 30:29.955
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

30:38.547 --> 30:39.840
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

30:39.882 --> 30:43.427
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

30:43.468 --> 30:45.304
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

30:45.345 --> 30:47.681
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, O Jesus.</i>

30:48.348 --> 30:49.850
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

30:49.892 --> 30:52.728
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

30:53.520 --> 30:56.899
<i>now and in the hour of our death. Amen.</i>

31:04.323 --> 31:08.035
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

31:24.593 --> 31:26.637
<i>Have you ever asked yourself</i>

31:26.678 --> 31:29.556
<i>why do the divinities
who appear in apparitions</i>

31:29.598 --> 31:34.144
<i>always match the traditional iconography
of the culture in which they appear?</i>

31:36.897 --> 31:39.024
<i>This is certainly true in your case,</i>

31:39.066 --> 31:41.860
<i>as it has been
for nearly all religious apparitions.</i>

31:41.902 --> 31:43.570
<i>Doesn't that seem strange to you?</i>

31:45.280 --> 31:46.281
<i>No.</i>

31:49.868 --> 31:52.746
If I follow your logic,
there are multiple divinities.

31:53.580 --> 31:58.961
Or it is the unconscious that translates
each person's desire to meet the divine

31:59.002 --> 32:01.421
in images that belong
to their particular culture.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.551
You call it the unconscious.

32:06.927 --> 32:08.220
I call Him God.

32:08.887 --> 32:11.056
Who, in His infinite wisdom,

32:11.098 --> 32:16.395
manifests Himself
in a form that we expect,

32:16.436 --> 32:20.357
in order to help us
understand better.

32:20.399 --> 32:23.569
So you believe that it is God
that chose the wrong position

32:23.610 --> 32:27.197
for the appearance of stigmata
on people's palms,

32:27.239 --> 32:30.242
rather than the suggestion
from classic iconography,

32:30.284 --> 32:32.327
such as paintings and sculptures,
what have you?

32:33.954 --> 32:36.164
Because we know
at the time of Christ,

32:36.206 --> 32:39.626
Romans used to nail
people's wrists to the cross,

32:40.544 --> 32:42.129
and not their palms.

32:46.633 --> 32:47.676
Professor...

32:49.803 --> 32:52.306
I can only give you my testimony.

32:54.141 --> 32:56.185
I don't have answers for everything.

33:10.365 --> 33:13.327
What did I tell you?
You can pick one.

33:17.623 --> 33:18.999
Would you like some bread?

33:19.708 --> 33:22.294
Did you hear about
the Virgin's appearance to Lucia?

33:25.589 --> 33:27.257
- Mayor.
- Good morning, Mayor.

33:30.677 --> 33:31.845
Good morning.

33:32.888 --> 33:34.973
- Good morning, Maria.
- Good morning, sir.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.808
- Children.
- Good morning.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.144
I see you've produced
quite a bit of wool this year.

33:39.186 --> 33:43.148
Yes. With the flock and the crops,
thank God we aren't lacking any food.

33:43.190 --> 33:45.984
Or you could say thanks to you
and your husband's hard work.

33:50.113 --> 33:54.660
You are one of the few
educated citizens in this village,

33:54.701 --> 33:59.414
and I know how well-respected you are
for your help with the poor and the sick.

33:59.456 --> 34:04.753
That's why the rumors I've heard
about your daughter's daydreams

34:04.795 --> 34:07.714
are, to say the least, odd.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.219
Go finish that
over there, please.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.853
They might as well be harmful
to the village and to your family.

34:22.437 --> 34:25.274
They're just children's games.
Nothing too important.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.193
I will be more careful
if needed.

34:30.027 --> 34:31.362
Mayor, you have my word.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.699
Please give your husband
my regards.

34:33.739 --> 34:34.908
I will.

34:39.913 --> 34:44.710
So, if it wasn't you,
nor Francisco or Jacinta...

34:46.253 --> 34:47.545
who was it?

34:47.588 --> 34:48.672
Hello, Papa.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.716
Father Ferreira, perhaps?

34:50.757 --> 34:51.800
I don't know.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.677
What's going on?

34:53.719 --> 34:54.719
Ask your daughter.

34:56.638 --> 34:57.931
Tell me what happened.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.310
At the market,
the mayor said it would be wise

35:01.351 --> 35:04.855
to keep an eye on our daughter
and all of this rambling nonsense,

35:04.897 --> 35:06.899
or else we'll be in trouble.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.487
We've done no wrong.

35:16.116 --> 35:17.618
You really shouldn't
worry so much.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.788
If you want, I can go
and have a talk with him.

35:22.623 --> 35:23.916
I already have.

35:24.374 --> 35:26.627
I told him
it was a children's game.

35:40.516 --> 35:41.975
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

35:42.017 --> 35:44.019
- Maria.
- Just a minute.

35:50.442 --> 35:51.693
Here.

35:52.945 --> 35:54.029
Take this.

35:54.071 --> 35:57.533
- May God bless you.
- Oh, no, no. Thank you, madam.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.161
Is this the Santos home?

36:02.246 --> 36:03.288
Yes.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.375
I've come for the seers.

36:08.836 --> 36:10.879
No, we don't have
any seers here.

36:16.301 --> 36:19.346
Sorry. We were told
she lives here.

36:20.639 --> 36:21.849
Well, they've told you a lie.

36:21.890 --> 36:25.018
If you like, I can give you a cup of broth
and a place to stay.

36:25.060 --> 36:26.228
But I'm sorry to tell you

36:27.062 --> 36:28.480
there are no seers here.

36:31.149 --> 36:32.860
Thank you. Good night.

36:32.901 --> 36:34.403
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:38.699 --> 36:40.450
Go to your room.

36:52.546 --> 36:55.215
So, do you still think
there's nothing to worry about?

37:17.070 --> 37:18.488
Lucia, we have to go.

37:21.033 --> 37:23.911
See what you've done?
You deceived everyone.

37:25.037 --> 37:27.039
May God forgive us.
Let's use the back door.

37:56.068 --> 37:59.446
Marques, Alberto.
7th Battalion.

38:00.447 --> 38:01.448
Deceased.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.326
Martin...

38:05.369 --> 38:07.496
Well, I was told
she lives here.

38:07.538 --> 38:09.581
Ah, there they are.

38:13.210 --> 38:16.964
- Lucia! Lucia! It's time!
- It's time!

38:17.631 --> 38:18.632
What was she like?

38:19.299 --> 38:20.759
Did she speak to you?

38:20.801 --> 38:24.179
Please pray for us. Please. Please.

38:24.555 --> 38:27.599
- Ask her to forgive my son.
- I'll ask her.

38:27.641 --> 38:29.852
Please pray for us.
Please pray for us.

38:29.893 --> 38:32.896
Will you stop? They are only kids!

38:33.730 --> 38:35.858
Please wait! I beg you!

38:35.899 --> 38:37.776
Let's take the way
through the woods.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.445
...Serafin.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.697
Come.

38:41.738 --> 38:44.449
2nd Battalion. Missing.

38:44.491 --> 38:48.328
We must go to church
to thank the Blessed Virgin

38:48.370 --> 38:51.206
for having protected your brother
once again.

38:51.248 --> 38:54.626
I can't come to church.
I promised the lady I would go back.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.962
Will you stop
disrespecting your mother?

38:57.379 --> 38:58.881
And the Holy Mother?

38:58.922 --> 39:00.382
- Let's go.
- I have to go.

39:14.188 --> 39:15.647
What shall we do?

39:16.398 --> 39:17.691
They're all there.

39:29.912 --> 39:31.205
There she is.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.207
- Look!
- Let's go!

39:34.750 --> 39:36.710
Here they are, the seers.

39:38.212 --> 39:40.631
I was worried
you weren't going to come.

39:40.672 --> 39:43.300
Please. My son, Diogo.

39:43.342 --> 39:46.345
- Can you ask the Virgin Mary to heal him?
- Can you help my wife?

39:49.723 --> 39:51.767
- Can you ask her to heal him?
- Please.

39:51.808 --> 39:55.020
- I can't see her.
- Diogo cannot walk. Please.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.147
- I can't see her.
- Lift her.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.651
- There she is.
- I can see her.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.894
That's good. Very good, girl.

40:41.733 --> 40:42.860
Papa?

40:44.862 --> 40:46.113
Pray for us.

40:48.740 --> 40:50.158
Father Ferreira was right.

40:50.701 --> 40:53.912
I just saw the devil.
He hides among the good.

40:54.830 --> 40:55.831
Lucia.

40:59.251 --> 41:00.502
We have to pray.

41:50.010 --> 41:53.680
It pleases me
that you have been praying for me.

41:55.682 --> 41:58.185
You must keep on
praying the rosary.

41:59.978 --> 42:01.813
You should also learn to read.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.816
It is very important.

42:05.567 --> 42:06.777
We will.

42:06.818 --> 42:08.362
We should learn to read.

42:12.366 --> 42:14.159
Diogo is here
with his mother.

42:14.743 --> 42:16.203
He can't walk.

42:23.043 --> 42:25.629
He will heal if he starts believing.

42:27.256 --> 42:28.715
Mother, thank you.

42:29.299 --> 42:31.593
She says God will heal Diogo.

42:32.636 --> 42:35.556
He will heal
if he starts believing.

42:37.099 --> 42:38.433
What does that mean?

42:38.475 --> 42:40.894
My son is already a believer.

42:40.936 --> 42:42.855
He will be healed, but when?

42:42.896 --> 42:44.231
Wait, Benedetta.

43:12.926 --> 43:13.927
I'm sorry, Mother.

43:19.474 --> 43:21.435
We want to go
to heaven with you.

43:23.645 --> 43:27.316
Francisco and Jacinta
will join me soon.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.152
But...

43:30.194 --> 43:32.029
She said we're going to heaven soon.

43:32.070 --> 43:33.572
But you have to stay.

43:34.907 --> 43:36.992
Jesus has chosen you.

43:38.911 --> 43:43.916
You are going to be the messenger of faith
in Mary's Immaculate Heart.

43:43.957 --> 43:46.668
Why does it have to be them
and not me?

43:51.507 --> 43:52.674
One day...

43:54.510 --> 43:56.970
a long time from now...

43:58.889 --> 44:00.807
I will come for you.

44:03.143 --> 44:05.479
I will never leave you alone.

44:26.416 --> 44:27.709
She is gone.

44:44.810 --> 44:46.353
Lucia. Lucia!

44:50.649 --> 44:51.733
Jacinta!

44:53.277 --> 44:55.195
Wait, Papa.
Put me down.

44:56.154 --> 44:57.322
Put me down.

45:00.951 --> 45:02.202
Diogo.

45:03.871 --> 45:05.747
Diogo.

45:07.499 --> 45:09.042
You are walking.

46:17.903 --> 46:19.404
There is one other thing.

46:20.948 --> 46:22.616
There was also a healing.

46:23.242 --> 46:24.618
Who was it?
Did you question them?

46:24.660 --> 46:27.120
No. He's just a boy.

46:27.162 --> 46:28.914
Diogo Lima.

46:28.956 --> 46:30.916
I know him.
When I was a child,

46:30.958 --> 46:32.793
his father and I
were good friends.

46:32.835 --> 46:35.254
He was paralyzed. Then, suddenly,

46:35.295 --> 46:38.423
for no reason,
he's able to move slightly.

46:39.091 --> 46:40.676
Some are calling it a miracle.

46:40.717 --> 46:44.263
A miracle? When Diogo Lima fell
from the barn's roof,

46:44.304 --> 46:47.015
I was the one who took him
to the hospital in Leiria.

46:47.057 --> 46:49.351
The doctors told me
he'd start to walk again

46:49.393 --> 46:53.438
if he really committed to it
and made a great effort in doing so.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.733
So, the appearances,
the miracle, the seers...

46:56.775 --> 46:58.443
it's all rubbish.

46:58.819 --> 47:00.988
But I believe
that's what people want,

47:01.029 --> 47:04.241
nothing else than tales
and a divine providence.

47:06.076 --> 47:07.953
We need to stop
the word from spreading.

47:07.995 --> 47:09.288
Absolutely, sir.

47:10.122 --> 47:11.206
But it won't be easy.

47:12.374 --> 47:13.709
Thank you, Captain.

47:15.002 --> 47:16.211
Good evening, <i>Senhora</i> Adelina.

47:17.087 --> 47:18.172
Mayor.

47:23.010 --> 47:25.470
What harm can three little children
possibly do?

47:26.597 --> 47:27.681
More than you think.

47:29.808 --> 47:32.686
They are roughly the same age
as Victor and Republica.

47:33.687 --> 47:35.564
Can you see our children
heading up an insurrection?

47:35.606 --> 47:38.442
Adelina, what is dangerous
is what they represent.

47:38.483 --> 47:39.693
More dangerous than weapons.

47:40.861 --> 47:43.822
What could be dangerous
about meeting the Holy Virgin?

47:43.864 --> 47:45.407
It is a beautiful thing.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.869
And it's wonderful
that it happened right here.

47:50.871 --> 47:54.499
You and I, we're so different.

47:55.292 --> 47:58.212
Yet we're good together. Right?

47:58.879 --> 48:00.380
Yes, of course, but...

48:01.381 --> 48:03.592
this has nothing to do with us.

48:03.634 --> 48:07.095
My rivals will use this tale
to attack me.

48:07.137 --> 48:12.184
I won't risk my position, my ideas,
everything I've built from scratch,

48:12.226 --> 48:13.852
for the imaginings
of three little children

48:13.894 --> 48:15.521
and some stupid superstition.

48:15.562 --> 48:17.397
Some stupid superstitions?

48:19.024 --> 48:21.360
So you've married
a stupid, superstitious woman.

48:21.401 --> 48:22.444
I didn't say that.

48:22.486 --> 48:25.614
All I'm saying is that there was
no miracle or appearance today.

48:27.574 --> 48:29.034
Let's just say that...

48:30.410 --> 48:32.913
it wasn't the Virgin Mary
who healed Diogo.

48:34.581 --> 48:38.001
But if he found the strength
to walk today, of all days,

48:38.043 --> 48:40.212
and in this specific place,

48:40.254 --> 48:42.256
then it's all down to his faith.

49:07.614 --> 49:09.199
- Mom?
- Yes?

49:09.241 --> 49:11.577
I want to learn
how to read and write.

49:11.618 --> 49:13.287
Oh, finally.

49:13.328 --> 49:16.415
I've told you so many times
how important it is.

49:16.456 --> 49:18.709
Because the lady says so.

49:18.750 --> 49:19.835
Of course.

49:20.377 --> 49:22.296
Now that the lady says so.

49:44.610 --> 49:45.611
Let's go.

50:06.048 --> 50:08.842
I lost my son,
and the Holy Mother did nothing.

50:12.179 --> 50:14.890
She let him die, like a dog,

50:15.599 --> 50:17.017
far from home.

50:18.352 --> 50:21.063
Although I prayed
day and night!

50:21.104 --> 50:22.940
I don't believe you anymore!

50:22.981 --> 50:24.525
I don't believe anything!

50:25.526 --> 50:26.693
Just go away!

50:27.611 --> 50:29.321
Come with me.
Come on.

50:31.698 --> 50:34.535
It's best you go home
and stop spreading lies.

50:35.202 --> 50:38.205
You should be ashamed
of having a daughter like her.

50:39.039 --> 50:42.167
You of all people,
who preaches faith and devotion.

50:42.209 --> 50:45.087
If she's crazy,
she should be shut away in a convent.

50:46.213 --> 50:48.882
Do you see what happens
when you make things up?

50:50.217 --> 50:52.219
Confess now, before everyone.

50:54.179 --> 50:56.390
And let us get all done with this.

51:03.730 --> 51:06.817
It's true, Mama. I saw the lady.

51:07.734 --> 51:09.194
And I'm not crazy.

51:22.416 --> 51:25.127
It takes courage
to vent your anger on a child.

51:27.004 --> 51:29.423
You have no children.

51:30.465 --> 51:34.553
And yours are but babies
who live in the warmth of your sound roof.

51:35.846 --> 51:38.765
I cannot hate you,
because that would be a sin.

51:52.321 --> 51:53.363
Ah!

52:54.341 --> 52:55.843
"As the Father has loved me,

52:56.677 --> 52:58.053
so have I loved you.

52:59.555 --> 53:01.348
Now remain in my love.

53:02.516 --> 53:04.685
If you keep my commands,

53:04.726 --> 53:06.353
you will remain in my love,

53:07.020 --> 53:09.731
just as I have kept
my Father's commands,

53:09.773 --> 53:11.859
and remain in His love."

53:11.900 --> 53:16.154
So Jesus said, "In truth I tell you,

53:16.196 --> 53:20.534
may my joy dwell in you,
and may your joy be full.

53:21.326 --> 53:26.832
My command is this:
love each other as I have loved you.

53:26.874 --> 53:27.958
Greater love..."

53:28.000 --> 53:29.209
What are you waiting for?

53:29.251 --> 53:30.669
- Manuel!
- Come here.

53:30.711 --> 53:34.256
"...to lay down one's life
for one's friends."

53:58.530 --> 54:00.407
I don't want to go back
to the front.

54:02.910 --> 54:03.952
Let me stay.

54:05.996 --> 54:07.706
Forget her, I beg you.

54:08.916 --> 54:11.335
Don't go there ever again.

54:11.376 --> 54:12.628
I can't just...

54:12.669 --> 54:14.046
Father Ferreira is right.

54:15.464 --> 54:17.633
- The lady is the devil's daughter.
- That is not true!

54:24.056 --> 54:25.307
I don't want to die.

54:27.226 --> 54:29.102
I beg you, don't go back to her.

54:30.604 --> 54:32.940
Then everything will be
as it used to.

54:37.236 --> 54:39.655
Manuel, come.

55:08.058 --> 55:09.351
Shh, shh, shh.

55:10.602 --> 55:11.812
You can't sleep?

55:12.312 --> 55:13.313
No.

55:13.355 --> 55:14.940
Neither can I.

55:17.359 --> 55:18.777
- Papa.
- Mmm?

55:20.654 --> 55:21.905
Do you believe me?

55:24.825 --> 55:25.993
I don't know.

55:30.789 --> 55:32.499
I know I'll never leave you.

55:36.211 --> 55:39.047
But I thought
it was such a beautiful thing.

55:39.089 --> 55:40.883
Yes, it is beautiful.

55:42.384 --> 55:45.345
Then why does it seem
like I'm hurting everyone?

55:48.557 --> 55:53.854
At times, our special gifts
can lead to trouble.

55:55.689 --> 55:57.232
People can get jealous.

55:58.817 --> 56:00.485
Others might not understand.

56:23.884 --> 56:25.886
Come on.

56:46.114 --> 56:47.491
Whenever.

56:47.533 --> 56:49.576
Please, Father.

57:28.699 --> 57:29.825
Get out.

57:31.785 --> 57:34.413
Get out! This is my field!

58:02.191 --> 58:04.109
We didn't know
where to settle down.

58:04.818 --> 58:06.486
We're here for the Virgin.

58:07.237 --> 58:09.239
We've all come
from far away.

58:09.281 --> 58:10.449
You've...

58:13.285 --> 58:16.622
You've destroyed...
This is our crop.

58:18.165 --> 58:19.166
This is...

58:21.043 --> 58:22.377
I'm sorry.

58:23.128 --> 58:25.339
We are going to leave
after the appearance.

58:35.015 --> 58:36.433
Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts...

58:36.475 --> 58:38.810
Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts...

58:38.852 --> 58:41.647
...which we're about to receive
from Thy bounty...

58:41.688 --> 58:43.941
...which we're about to receive
from Thy bounty...

58:43.982 --> 58:46.777
- ...through Christ our Lord.
- ...through Christ our Lord.

58:47.444 --> 58:51.114
- Thanks be to God. Amen.
- Thanks be to God. Amen.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.284
Amen.

58:56.370 --> 58:57.579
Give me the wine.

59:02.543 --> 59:04.878
Papa is worried,
and it's all your fault.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.505
This coming winter,
we won't have anything to eat...

59:06.547 --> 59:09.049
Stop it. Don't insist.

59:14.680 --> 59:15.764
Serve yourself.

59:26.900 --> 59:29.027
At the market the other day,

59:29.903 --> 59:31.196
I saw Dona Clara.

59:33.699 --> 59:35.075
Are you listening, António?

59:35.701 --> 59:36.785
Yes.

59:37.452 --> 59:38.954
Can you help me here,
please?

59:41.248 --> 59:44.585
She said she was looking for someone
to help her around the house.

59:45.544 --> 59:48.213
- And she asked about Carolina.
- No.

59:48.255 --> 59:49.631
But the Gomezes
are good people.

59:54.595 --> 59:58.098
Do you think I like the idea
of sending our daughter off to work?

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:20.746
I didn't mean to.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:30.797
I have the feeling
we are losing everything we love...

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.927
and have built so far.

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:40.557
I feel useless.

01:01:00.911 --> 01:01:02.663
I don't want you to go.

01:01:04.122 --> 01:01:05.332
I won't.

01:01:44.872 --> 01:01:46.248
I beg you!

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.131
I don't want other people suffering!

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:08.395
I do this for the sinners!

01:02:08.437 --> 01:02:09.771
As you asked!

01:02:13.525 --> 01:02:15.027
Where are you?

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:18.363
Where are you?

01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:23.911
Where are you?

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:39.968
But how did you,
Francisco and Jacinta endure it all?

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.803
You were only ten years old.

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:43.472
But what strikes me even more

01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:46.975
is the message you claim
the Virgin charged you with,

01:02:47.017 --> 01:02:49.895
a message of suffering
and atonement.

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:52.397
Why would she choose you,
a child, of all people?

01:02:53.732 --> 01:02:55.859
There was just one moment

01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:58.612
when I couldn't understand.

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:03.242
But we were willing
to put up with it all.

01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:09.373
I know. It's hard to understand
for someone who's not a believer.

01:03:09.414 --> 01:03:10.457
I understand.

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:16.088
Innocent messengers make the message
all the more sacred and unassailable.

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:17.464
But at what cost?

01:03:18.048 --> 01:03:19.883
Do you really think
that's what your God wants?

01:03:19.925 --> 01:03:22.928
It seems contrary
to all logic to me

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:26.265
to ask little children...
seven, eight, ten-year-olds...

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:30.269
to suffer and make sacrifices
the way you three did.

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.981
Sure, you could tell me
that Christ sacrificed himself.

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:37.025
But he did it for his beliefs,
his ideas.

01:03:38.485 --> 01:03:39.778
But he was a grown man.

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:46.577
Faith begins
at the edges of understanding.

01:03:46.618 --> 01:03:50.455
But it's there where scientific research
for the truth should begin.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:55.961
But then what is faith
if not the search for truth?

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:58.463
An inexplicable truth

01:03:58.505 --> 01:04:00.674
which breeds irrational hope.

01:04:26.283 --> 01:04:28.493
Mama,
it is far too hot for you here.

01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:29.995
No, I'm fine.

01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:34.750
Greetings, Mayor.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:36.710
The men are ready.

01:04:37.336 --> 01:04:39.046
I can give them the order
to have it cleared.

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:45.010
No, there is no point.
There are too many people.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:09.284
They're not talking to anyone.

01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:11.870
And nobody believes me.

01:05:13.914 --> 01:05:15.249
Can I ask you for a miracle

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.918
so that everyone will know
you appeared to us?

01:05:21.088 --> 01:05:25.175
Soon she will perform a miracle
for everyone to see,

01:05:25.217 --> 01:05:27.928
so you can believe it is true.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:30.097
So, why doesn't she
do it now then?

01:05:30.138 --> 01:05:31.723
He's right.

01:05:31.765 --> 01:05:33.559
Because it is all a lie.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.269
- There is no appearance happening.
- Shh.

01:05:37.521 --> 01:05:39.773
You must pray often...

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:43.277
and suffer greatly.

01:05:44.611 --> 01:05:47.030
Sacrifice yourself for sinners.

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:51.118
Do not hurt yourselves
with ropes.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:56.790
And repeat this prayer.

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:02.921
O Jesus.

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:05.757
O Jesus.

01:06:05.799 --> 01:06:07.968
O Jesus.

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.890
I'm offering you this...

01:06:12.931 --> 01:06:14.808
I'm offering you this...

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:17.895
I'm offering you this...

01:06:17.936 --> 01:06:20.272
...in exchange for your love.

01:06:20.314 --> 01:06:22.149
...in exchange for your love.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.652
...in exchange for your love.

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.447
For the conversion of sinners...

01:06:28.488 --> 01:06:32.075
For the conversion of sinners...

01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:35.120
...and to amend sins committed against

01:06:35.162 --> 01:06:37.664
the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

01:06:37.706 --> 01:06:43.670
...and to amend sins committed
against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:26.505
What was that?

01:07:26.547 --> 01:07:28.131
That was hell.

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.885
Where the sinners' poor souls go.

01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:37.975
If we do not stop insulting God...

01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:42.604
there will be a war
worse than this one.

01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:06.020
This is what will happen
if sinners do not convert.

01:09:09.942 --> 01:09:13.819
Do not tell anyone
what you have seen

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:15.322
until I tell you to.

01:09:26.082 --> 01:09:27.376
Why is she crying?

01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:35.634
Tell Papa what happened.

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.636
The lady told me
not to tell anyone.

01:09:40.595 --> 01:09:43.850
She said we had to pray
and repent for our sins.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:47.062
- We need to pray.
- She's right.

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:50.064
The seer is saying we must ask
for forgiveness for our sins.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:23.307
As I told you before,

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:26.560
you can't keep a secret
from a priest.

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:32.399
Father Ferreira is right.
He's a man of God.

01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:34.693
Father, I told her,
but it's useless.

01:10:43.452 --> 01:10:44.912
Stay back! Stay back!

01:10:46.163 --> 01:10:48.665
This is a house of peace.
Please take your guards away.

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:51.210
Rallies are illegal.
I did warn you.

01:10:52.336 --> 01:10:54.213
Remove all these people
from the church.

01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:57.466
They have to go back
to wherever they came from. Go.

01:10:57.508 --> 01:11:00.427
Stop! Will you stop, please?

01:11:00.469 --> 01:11:03.972
There's no need for violence.
I will exit with all my faithful.

01:11:05.557 --> 01:11:07.559
Let the priest guide them out.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.738
Artur, stop.
How can you do this?

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.822
This is absurd.

01:11:20.864 --> 01:11:22.241
I'm doing this for you.

01:11:22.574 --> 01:11:24.868
Would you like people to talk
about a priest in Fátima

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:27.579
who's being fooled
by three lying children?

01:11:28.622 --> 01:11:31.750
This is not faith.
This is superstition, and we both know it.

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:34.211
No. So your answer to this

01:11:34.253 --> 01:11:37.172
is pushing out all the faithful
who came here for confession

01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:38.799
and bolt the church?

01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:43.554
Your mother used to come here often,
and she would bring you with her.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.932
My mother was illiterate.
Unfortunately for you, I'm not.

01:11:46.974 --> 01:11:49.434
- I'm different.
- Knowledge means tolerance.

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:54.147
Until order is restored,
the church stays closed.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:03.198
He had them
shut down the church.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.950
- That's never happened here.
- Adelina, enough!

01:12:04.992 --> 01:12:06.618
These issues
do not concern you.

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.161
Yes, they do.

01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:13.375
Read this.

01:12:14.334 --> 01:12:15.794
It's from Lisbon,

01:12:15.836 --> 01:12:18.797
requesting an explanation
and instructing me to restore order.

01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:24.178
This is not an easy time for me, Adelina.
Please try to understand that.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.680
And don't make things
even more difficult for me

01:12:26.722 --> 01:12:28.223
like you did today.

01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.082
So, the Virgin
has revealed some secrets to you.

01:13:01.632 --> 01:13:05.469
Apparently, she told you
not to say anything

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:09.014
about these secrets,
not even to your bishop.

01:13:09.723 --> 01:13:10.891
Yes, Excellency.

01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:15.729
But I thought you said
you could not hear her.

01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:17.272
Is that right?

01:13:18.607 --> 01:13:19.858
We told him.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.819
We tell him
everything the Virgin says.

01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:24.863
I am not talking to you now.

01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:30.702
So, you said
you cannot hear her

01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:33.747
because you haven't prayed
the rosary enough.

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.876
I... I don't know.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:41.088
But the Virgin
did not explain why,

01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:43.882
of all people
she might have appeared to,

01:13:43.924 --> 01:13:46.385
she chose a boy
who doesn't pray enough.

01:13:47.845 --> 01:13:49.847
How long is this torture
going to last?

01:13:50.764 --> 01:13:54.518
Father, he's been asking the same question
for the last two hours.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.938
As long as the monsignor
deems necessary.

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:01.441
Jacinta.

01:14:02.693 --> 01:14:03.944
Tell me the truth.

01:14:07.447 --> 01:14:09.825
Whatever the truth may be,

01:14:09.867 --> 01:14:12.828
it won't only be
the parish who will pay,

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.581
but all the Church of Portugal.

01:14:34.975 --> 01:14:36.643
I'm going to see Tio Anastacio.

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:53.410
Can you please go?
That's enough.

01:14:53.827 --> 01:14:56.496
- Can you go back? Just go back.
- Please. Please.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.665
Freire, Eduardo.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:02.002
19th Battalion. Deceased.

01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:07.716
Filipe, Paulo. 19th Battalion.

01:15:08.342 --> 01:15:10.302
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:15:12.221 --> 01:15:16.725
The last time I heard from my eldest son
was two months ago.

01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:19.937
Gavinho, Eduardo.

01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:23.607
19th Battalion. Deceased.

01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:31.782
Mama, are you all right?

01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:32.866
Yes.

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:36.245
Sales, Francisco.

01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:39.373
11th Battalion. Deceased.

01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:45.087
Santos, Manuel.

01:15:49.383 --> 01:15:50.717
4th Battalion.

01:15:51.969 --> 01:15:53.428
Missing in battle.

01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:58.350
That's it.

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:04.565
Every time I read the name
of one of our boys who lost his life

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.942
- defending the ideals of our republic...
- Mama.

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:09.027
- ...I have great admiration for them.
- Mama.

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:12.573
But also immense pain.

01:16:12.614 --> 01:16:13.615
Mama.

01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:18.036
- Please.
- But today I ask you...

01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:20.205
Mama.

01:16:20.956 --> 01:16:23.959
...if the Virgin has appeared
for real in Fátima,

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:28.755
then why on earth didn't she protect
these poor young men

01:16:28.797 --> 01:16:31.300
and spare their families this awful pain?

01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:18.555
The mayor said he's lost,
not dead.

01:17:19.348 --> 01:17:21.016
- The lady will help us.
- Oh!

01:17:21.433 --> 01:17:23.602
You mustn't say her name
in my presence!

01:17:23.644 --> 01:17:24.686
But it is true, Mama.

01:17:29.608 --> 01:17:32.819
- For the sinners...
- Oh, stop making fun of me!

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:36.782
Do you hear me?
Don't make fun of me!

01:17:36.823 --> 01:17:40.994
If Manuel doesn't come back,
it's all your fault.

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:10.417
Papa.

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.806
I'm going to sell the herd.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.770
There's no need for you
to go to Cova da Iria anymore.

01:19:57.256 --> 01:20:01.260
I understand you are no longer
so sure of what you have said.

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:05.180
- Yes, she is.
- Tell him.

01:20:05.222 --> 01:20:07.641
- Let her speak.
- Jacinta. Shh.

01:20:08.392 --> 01:20:12.145
You heard your mother.
Say what you must.

01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:03.697
You caused the church
to be shut down.

01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.743
Do you understand
how serious that is?

01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:15.042
All you need to say now is,
"I made everything up."

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:17.419
And everything will be solved.

01:21:25.719 --> 01:21:26.929
Thank you.

01:21:36.855 --> 01:21:40.108
I don't know anymore. Please.

01:21:42.319 --> 01:21:43.403
So?

01:21:44.905 --> 01:21:50.244
Lucia, you don't have to worry anymore
about what you told me yesterday.

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.621
Sometimes we lose ourselves.

01:21:53.914 --> 01:21:55.165
What I need to hear...

01:21:56.416 --> 01:21:59.878
is what you are feeling
deep down. Hmm?

01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:10.097
I will speak to the Curia.

01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:13.433
Your behavior is ridiculous.

01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:17.104
- Excellency. Excellency.
- Please pray for me.

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:19.815
- Please pray for me.
- Please bless us.

01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:27.739
Can we pray with you?

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:51.471
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

01:22:51.513 --> 01:22:52.890
Blessed art thou among women,

01:22:52.931 --> 01:22:55.767
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:22:56.768 --> 01:23:00.772
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

01:23:00.814 --> 01:23:03.025
now and at the hour of our death.

01:23:20.959 --> 01:23:23.670
<i>Did you ever have doubts
about what you'd seen?</i>

01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:28.467
Did you never once thought,
not even later on,

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:31.553
that your imagination
might have been sparked by...

01:23:31.595 --> 01:23:34.306
influenced by circumstances?

01:23:34.348 --> 01:23:36.350
War, hunger, solitude.

01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:40.062
A lack of affection.

01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:42.022
Why would I have?

01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:46.985
The Virgin appeared
in order to save us

01:23:47.027 --> 01:23:48.987
from those circumstances.

01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:52.533
The Virgin appeared to save you from...
from your mother?

01:23:56.537 --> 01:23:57.704
Hmm.

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:03.794
It appears that Jacinta
was the most mystic among you.

01:24:05.963 --> 01:24:07.297
Yes, she was.

01:24:08.465 --> 01:24:11.802
Maybe because she was younger.
She was only seven.

01:24:11.844 --> 01:24:15.264
Maybe because you two were older
and she was trying to outdo you.

01:24:15.305 --> 01:24:18.517
No. She was that way.

01:24:19.935 --> 01:24:21.812
She had a gift.

01:24:23.522 --> 01:24:27.943
Did you see her body
after she was exhumed?

01:24:27.985 --> 01:24:30.612
Yes, I saw it.
It was completely intact.

01:24:30.654 --> 01:24:33.073
And you naturally believe...

01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:36.577
it is just a coincidence?

01:24:40.122 --> 01:24:41.498
No, it's different.

01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:45.836
I think it's incredible
and unexplainable.

01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:49.214
But not everything unexplainable
is necessarily transcendent.

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:53.552
Sometimes
it's just that we are limited.

01:24:54.428 --> 01:25:00.017
Therefore, fortuitous,
unexplainable circumstances?

01:25:03.187 --> 01:25:04.313
Sorry.

01:25:06.899 --> 01:25:12.321
Sometimes I have to tease you.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing my job.

01:25:12.362 --> 01:25:15.866
Which one? Helping me with my book
or converting me?

01:25:18.327 --> 01:25:20.370
<i>Do what the Virgin tells you to!</i>

01:25:20.412 --> 01:25:21.622
Pray the rosary!

01:25:23.207 --> 01:25:26.043
Rosaries! Rosaries!

01:25:26.084 --> 01:25:27.586
Six cents!

01:25:27.628 --> 01:25:29.588
Would you like
the Virgin's rosary?

01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:34.218
Where are the seers?
It's almost midday.

01:25:34.259 --> 01:25:36.261
I don't know, madam.
Thank you.

01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:38.805
Rosaries! The Virgin's rosaries!

01:25:39.556 --> 01:25:42.976
We came to see our children.

01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:44.603
We only take orders
from the captain.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.189
- Or the mayor.
- The mayor fooled us.

01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:50.275
He told us he would have brought them
to Father Ferreira's house.

01:25:50.317 --> 01:25:52.152
To question them. And here he is.

01:25:52.194 --> 01:25:54.696
- Please, at least let me come in.
- No.

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:57.366
You must let us in.
We need to speak to the mayor.

01:25:57.407 --> 01:25:59.076
That's impossible.

01:25:59.117 --> 01:26:00.410
- I want to see our children!
- No.

01:26:00.452 --> 01:26:02.579
- I want... My child is in there!
- António!

01:26:04.122 --> 01:26:05.958
- My child is...
- António!

01:26:05.999 --> 01:26:07.960
- Don't!
- No, no! Stand back.

01:26:14.633 --> 01:26:17.177
Go on, have some food.
Don't be afraid.

01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:29.982
So, why are you doing this? Hmm?

01:26:34.486 --> 01:26:35.821
Because I'm hungry.

01:26:39.032 --> 01:26:40.617
Not that.

01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:46.248
When was the first time
you had the idea of seeing the lady?

01:26:46.999 --> 01:26:48.500
Who is behind all of this?

01:26:57.092 --> 01:26:59.386
Your mother loved Manuel
very much.

01:27:00.721 --> 01:27:02.389
Her only son.

01:27:02.431 --> 01:27:05.392
I remember he was a smart boy.
Handsome too.

01:27:06.018 --> 01:27:08.270
Your mother just wanted him
to come home.

01:27:08.854 --> 01:27:11.732
For all that time,
it was as if you didn't even exist.

01:27:14.985 --> 01:27:16.904
And now Manuel is dead.

01:27:16.945 --> 01:27:19.823
And your mother blames you.
She's angry at you.

01:27:22.576 --> 01:27:25.162
That must be very painful.
Isn't it?

01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:28.415
Well, yes.

01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:34.087
Yeah. I understand
what it means to, uh...

01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:36.256
long for...

01:27:38.133 --> 01:27:40.260
to wish for someone's love.

01:27:42.054 --> 01:27:43.388
So, uh...

01:27:44.598 --> 01:27:48.769
one day you were feeling
lonely and hurt.

01:27:49.603 --> 01:27:52.481
And you imagined
another mother.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.985
And I know you did tell your cousins,
"It's all just a game."

01:27:57.027 --> 01:27:59.863
But little Jacinta, who worships you,
believes your game

01:27:59.905 --> 01:28:02.199
- to the point it becomes real.
- That's not true!

01:28:02.241 --> 01:28:03.617
I saw her.

01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:08.247
But now, if you tell everyone
it was just a game,

01:28:08.288 --> 01:28:11.375
you know they'll all be
disappointed and angry.

01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:13.669
And you don't know
how to stop this game, do you?

01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:20.133
I don't want to fool anyone.

01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:24.972
I'm so sorry you couldn't see her.

01:29:02.593 --> 01:29:05.304
Thank you for coming all the way here
on such short notice.

01:29:05.345 --> 01:29:08.056
The health authority
explained the urgency.

01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:09.808
Your medical opinion
is very important to us,

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:12.186
and it will help us
resolve this matter.

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:27.367
...pray for us sinners,

01:29:27.409 --> 01:29:30.871
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

01:29:30.913 --> 01:29:34.499
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:29:34.541 --> 01:29:36.502
Blessed art thou among women

01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:39.171
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:42.674
Let me show you
where the children are.

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:47.513
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:29:48.347 --> 01:29:50.224
Blessed art thou amongst women

01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:52.559
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:29:53.477 --> 01:29:57.397
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

01:29:57.439 --> 01:30:00.776
Now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

01:30:01.777 --> 01:30:04.404
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:30:05.364 --> 01:30:07.199
Blessed art thou amongst women

01:30:07.241 --> 01:30:10.035
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:30:10.077 --> 01:30:13.705
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:16.917
Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

01:30:17.543 --> 01:30:21.004
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.881
Blessed art thou amongst women...

01:30:32.641 --> 01:30:34.101
I asked you
for one thing only:

01:30:34.142 --> 01:30:36.270
not to let yourself be seen
with those people.

01:30:39.606 --> 01:30:40.774
Free the children.

01:30:42.484 --> 01:30:43.527
Let them go.

01:30:43.569 --> 01:30:45.737
Adelina, they're being seen
by the psychiatrist.

01:30:45.779 --> 01:30:48.198
Please don't worry.
I know what I'm doing. Just go home.

01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.575
Are you sure you're doing this

01:30:49.616 --> 01:30:51.910
just because of the pressure
coming from Lisbon?

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:55.622
You should be worrying
about our children.

01:30:56.290 --> 01:30:58.125
Now leave me
and let me do my job.

01:31:02.504 --> 01:31:04.131
Answer my question.

01:31:11.555 --> 01:31:13.098
Release those children, Artur.

01:31:14.183 --> 01:31:15.976
- There's a limit to everything.
- Exactly.

01:31:16.018 --> 01:31:17.311
So please go home

01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:19.813
and don't let anyone see you
with those people ever again.

01:31:19.855 --> 01:31:22.149
And don't you force me to choose.

01:31:23.859 --> 01:31:25.027
Mayor.

01:31:26.945 --> 01:31:28.280
The doctor's ready
to see you now.

01:31:29.489 --> 01:31:31.116
Please send him in.

01:31:31.158 --> 01:31:33.869
If you could escort my wife,
she was about to leave us.

01:31:36.038 --> 01:31:38.415
Yes, sir. What about them?

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.585
- What should we do?
- Let them pray.

01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:44.338
I'm sure they'll get tired
of it eventually.

01:31:59.645 --> 01:32:00.646
I'm sorry.

01:32:04.274 --> 01:32:06.276
I spoke to them in detail.

01:32:06.985 --> 01:32:11.615
I didn't find any type of pathology,
neither physical nor mental,

01:32:12.241 --> 01:32:14.993
that could justify
a forced hospitalization.

01:32:15.994 --> 01:32:17.871
You could still give me
some kind of proof

01:32:17.913 --> 01:32:21.667
or a tool
to prove their dishonesty.

01:32:21.708 --> 01:32:23.877
I mean, this tale would collapse
in no time.

01:32:24.837 --> 01:32:29.842
The only thing I can give you is this copy
I prepared for the authorities in Lisbon.

01:32:32.094 --> 01:32:33.387
Thank you, Doctor.

01:32:33.428 --> 01:32:35.222
Glory be to the Father...

01:32:35.889 --> 01:32:38.559
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

01:32:39.184 --> 01:32:41.353
Glory be to the Father,

01:32:41.395 --> 01:32:44.481
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

01:32:45.065 --> 01:32:46.191
Over there, children.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:48.068
- Mama! Mama!
- Lucia!

01:32:49.903 --> 01:32:50.946
Lucia!

01:32:53.866 --> 01:32:55.242
- Mama!
- Lucia!

01:32:55.284 --> 01:32:56.326
Oh!

01:32:59.288 --> 01:33:00.497
Are you all right?

01:33:01.373 --> 01:33:04.084
- I missed you.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:33:08.839 --> 01:33:09.882
I love you.

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:35.407
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.128
She is very weak.

01:33:49.838 --> 01:33:51.590
Just a moment, please.

01:33:51.632 --> 01:33:53.300
Get her something to eat.

01:33:53.342 --> 01:33:56.762
And make sure
she gets some rest.

01:33:56.803 --> 01:33:58.430
Try some steam inhalation.

01:34:00.015 --> 01:34:01.600
Can you please wait, Doctor?

01:34:07.648 --> 01:34:09.149
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

01:34:10.108 --> 01:34:11.360
Thank you, Doctor.

01:34:19.576 --> 01:34:22.663
We're in dire need now.
So where is your lady?

01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:24.289
- Leave her alone.
- Stop it.

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.963
I want you all here by my side.

01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:32.381
All of you.

01:34:34.174 --> 01:34:35.676
You, too, Lucia.

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.555
Lucia.

01:34:40.681 --> 01:34:41.765
Come.

01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:54.069
God has given me the blessing.

01:34:57.364 --> 01:34:58.824
He wants to take me to Manuel.

01:34:58.866 --> 01:35:01.493
That's enough.
Maria, please.

01:35:01.535 --> 01:35:03.203
Enough of this nonsense.

01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:06.874
The doctor did not say
you were passing.

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:16.258
Lucia.

01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:19.386
Where is she going?

01:36:55.816 --> 01:36:56.984
Lucia.

01:36:58.527 --> 01:36:59.528
Lucia.

01:37:04.283 --> 01:37:05.909
I think it's time to go.

01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:11.164
I'm sure Mama
is feeling better now.

01:37:31.185 --> 01:37:32.227
Father.

01:37:32.269 --> 01:37:34.354
António, I came
because I have some good news.

01:37:35.105 --> 01:37:39.526
It's from Manuel.
He's alive. He's alive.

01:37:40.194 --> 01:37:42.362
The military chaplain wrote the letter.

01:37:42.404 --> 01:37:45.657
He says he's wounded,
but not seriously wounded.

01:37:45.699 --> 01:37:47.117
Thank God for that.

01:37:47.951 --> 01:37:49.536
Thank you.

01:37:49.578 --> 01:37:53.040
Lucia. Manuel is alive.

01:37:53.665 --> 01:37:55.042
Manuel is alive!

01:37:55.918 --> 01:37:57.377
Manuel is alive.

01:37:58.337 --> 01:38:00.464
He's... He's alive.

01:38:00.506 --> 01:38:02.716
Oh, he's alive.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.887
It appears your prayers
have been answered.

01:38:06.929 --> 01:38:11.225
My mother always said
I was not good at convincing people.

01:38:11.266 --> 01:38:14.561
I have never thought it possible
to convince you.

01:38:14.603 --> 01:38:16.563
You haven't.
Don't be getting too confident.

01:38:19.399 --> 01:38:23.529
I hope our meetings will be good
for the writing of your book.

01:38:24.196 --> 01:38:25.864
Not only in that.

01:38:25.906 --> 01:38:28.742
Professor Nichols,
your taxi is here.

01:38:29.493 --> 01:38:31.036
Thank you.
I'll be right out.

01:38:31.662 --> 01:38:33.247
Thank you, Sister.

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:37.042
If I remember correctly,
there was a great controversy

01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:39.419
over the fact
that the Virgin claimed

01:38:39.461 --> 01:38:42.005
the war would end
on the day of the miracle.

01:38:42.047 --> 01:38:44.258
It is appropriate to remind you...

01:39:12.995 --> 01:39:14.746
We don't want to wait.

01:39:14.788 --> 01:39:16.415
We're tired.

01:39:16.456 --> 01:39:18.166
Nobody asked you to come!

01:39:24.131 --> 01:39:27.509
She won't come.
It's raining too much.

01:39:59.458 --> 01:40:03.337
Six cents! Rosaries!

01:40:03.378 --> 01:40:04.963
Rosaries!

01:40:05.005 --> 01:40:07.966
Rosaries! Rosaries, six cents!

01:40:08.008 --> 01:40:10.969
Rosaries!
Blessed by the seers themselves!

01:40:11.011 --> 01:40:12.679
Go, go, shout more.

01:40:12.721 --> 01:40:14.264
- Rosaries!
- Rosaries!

01:40:14.306 --> 01:40:16.808
- Blessed by the seers themselves!
- Rosaries!

01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:17.935
Rosaries!

01:40:17.976 --> 01:40:19.520
Thank you for coming, sir.

01:40:19.561 --> 01:40:21.813
- Have I missed anything?
- No.

01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:25.150
Nothing has happened yet.
Just rain and people praying.

01:40:25.192 --> 01:40:26.735
You wouldn't want
someone like me

01:40:26.777 --> 01:40:29.738
to miss out writing about
this possible miracle.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:30.781
No.

01:40:31.198 --> 01:40:33.617
It's the only topic
being discussed in Lisbon.

01:41:36.805 --> 01:41:39.391
Hello, my children.

01:41:40.184 --> 01:41:43.020
Thank you for coming to see me.

01:41:51.445 --> 01:41:54.823
Can you please tell us who you are?
These people want to know.

01:41:54.865 --> 01:41:57.993
There she is.

01:42:06.001 --> 01:42:08.295
I am the Lady of the Rosary.

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:13.133
I am going to lead them
to my son

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:15.677
through peace and love.

01:42:19.306 --> 01:42:22.100
She says
she's the Lady of the Rosary!

01:42:23.644 --> 01:42:26.063
Rosaries, now ten cents!

01:42:26.104 --> 01:42:29.983
She will lead us to her son
through peace and love.

01:42:30.901 --> 01:42:33.612
They must not insult the Lord,

01:42:33.654 --> 01:42:35.989
who is already far too insulted.

01:42:37.407 --> 01:42:38.951
You have to pray.

01:42:41.036 --> 01:42:44.206
Pray the rosary every day!

01:42:44.248 --> 01:42:46.917
And you mustn't insult the Lord.

01:42:46.959 --> 01:42:49.253
He's already far too insulted.

01:42:58.011 --> 01:43:01.431
The war will end soon!

01:43:08.605 --> 01:43:11.817
And our soldiers are to return home
to their families.

01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:24.329
Look at them.

01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:27.040
A huge crowd of people
hanging on to every word

01:43:27.082 --> 01:43:30.586
a little lying, stubborn
and ignorant girl is saying.

01:43:33.714 --> 01:43:37.092
Some people
are never going to believe.

01:43:39.386 --> 01:43:42.723
Even when standing
before the face of God.

01:43:44.057 --> 01:43:45.058
Look.

01:43:46.393 --> 01:43:47.394
The sun!

01:44:56.797 --> 01:44:58.841
The sun is falling!

01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:06.139
Move out of the way!
Move out of the way!

01:45:06.765 --> 01:45:08.350
Victor! Republica!

01:45:51.894 --> 01:45:53.187
Thank you.

01:46:06.867 --> 01:46:07.868
Go.

01:46:29.806 --> 01:46:32.434
Lucia.

01:46:33.435 --> 01:46:35.562
- Please help.
- Lucia, we love you.

01:46:37.731 --> 01:46:39.024
We'd better go.

01:49:09.383 --> 01:49:12.469
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.</i>

01:50:12.988 --> 01:50:16.408
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.</i>

01:50:17.034 --> 01:50:18.911
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

01:50:18.952 --> 01:50:21.455
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.126
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

01:50:26.168 --> 01:50:28.212
<i>now and at the hour of our death.</i>
