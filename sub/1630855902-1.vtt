00:38.263 --> 00:40.896
(In AD 1609 of the Ming dynasty)

00:40.896 --> 00:44.331
(Du County in Jiangnan)

00:50.320 --> 00:51.119
Over there.

01:01.479 --> 01:02.039
Sangeng.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.479
Let's go take a look.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.760
Master.

02:08.319 --> 02:10.240
Mr. Song, Captain Leng died.

02:16.319 --> 02:17.439
There are words on it.

02:33.015 --> 02:35.232
(My principle is unified.)

03:38.510 --> 03:42.016
=Ripe Town=
=Episode 1=

03:42.439 --> 03:45.199
Is he Leng Wuji?

03:45.560 --> 03:48.199
Yes, he is.

03:51.000 --> 03:51.719
Cover him.

03:56.159 --> 03:56.759
Coroner,

03:57.560 --> 03:58.759
is there the postmortem result?

03:59.159 --> 03:59.919
Yes.

04:01.039 --> 04:04.039
Captain Leng was strangled.

04:04.639 --> 04:05.960
His cervical spine was snapped.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.080
I infer that he was hanged to death.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.759
Someone used this rod

04:11.439 --> 04:12.479
to pierce his body

04:13.520 --> 04:16.120
and covered him with some straw,

04:16.519 --> 04:18.240
making him a scarecrow in the field.

04:19.879 --> 04:23.079
The murderer is outrageous.

04:23.759 --> 04:24.439
Well,

04:26.879 --> 04:29.160
such a long wooden rod

04:29.879 --> 04:30.920
is quite rare.

04:32.759 --> 04:34.079
This should be a litter rod.

04:35.920 --> 04:36.800
How do you know?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.199
This rod is made of mulberry wood.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.040
You even know about wood?

04:41.720 --> 04:42.680
I don't.

04:43.439 --> 04:46.639
I just compared it
with eight kinds of wood.

04:46.759 --> 04:48.120
So I confirm it is mulberry wood.

04:48.399 --> 04:50.399
Mulberry wood is both hard and tough,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.000
so most litter rods are made
of mulberry wood.

04:54.519 --> 04:56.240
Considering its length and thickness,

04:57.319 --> 05:00.639
I infer it's a litter rod.

05:03.839 --> 05:04.879
A litter rod?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.199
So the murderer is a litter bearer.

05:09.160 --> 05:09.720
Master,

05:10.920 --> 05:11.959
in my opinion,

05:13.040 --> 05:14.759
I don't think so.

05:16.079 --> 05:18.040
Litter bearers are usually uneducated.

05:19.079 --> 05:20.120
But on this rod,

05:21.160 --> 05:22.439
there are words of classical Chinese.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.079
Words on it?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.279
Master, it's over here.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.000
Look.

05:32.519 --> 05:34.680
My principle is unified.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.920
The murderer quoted Confucius.

05:45.439 --> 05:48.160
The murderer cited the classics.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.439
So,

05:51.000 --> 05:52.240
the murderer is not a litter bearer,

05:52.600 --> 05:55.240
or a thief taking revenge
on Captain Leng.

05:55.759 --> 05:56.920
That makes sense.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.399
The thieves caught
by Captain Leng mostly are illiterate.

06:00.959 --> 06:01.439
You...

06:03.199 --> 06:04.439
What's your name?

06:06.480 --> 06:09.480
I am Qu Sangeng,
a Yamen runner of Hunter Squad.

06:10.879 --> 06:11.800
I remember now.

06:12.279 --> 06:13.879
You're Captain Leng's apprentice.

06:14.800 --> 06:15.279
Yes.

06:16.079 --> 06:17.000
Have you been to school?

06:17.680 --> 06:19.560
For one year in a private school.

06:20.639 --> 06:21.920
Have you read this before?

06:22.720 --> 06:23.759
I haven't.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.360
What about you?

06:30.199 --> 06:32.720
Me neither, Master.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.680
But I do understand its meaning.

06:36.279 --> 06:37.639
What does it mean?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.720
As far as I know,

06:41.000 --> 06:41.959
it indicated the rod pierced

06:42.160 --> 06:45.319
through Captain Leng's body.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.439
You're smart.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.079
I'm flattered.

06:56.199 --> 06:57.040
Could it be

06:58.160 --> 06:59.839
the murderer is a scholar?

07:06.160 --> 07:07.160
Advise me

07:07.160 --> 07:09.199
on where to start with this case.

07:12.864 --> 07:14.144
(Judge, Government officer)
Mr. Song.

07:14.144 --> 07:16.064
(in charge of the verdict in Yamen)
What's your opinion?

07:16.279 --> 07:17.959
In my opinion,

07:18.639 --> 07:19.879
in Du County,

07:20.439 --> 07:21.720
there are a few people

07:22.759 --> 07:23.920
who know this phrase.

07:26.399 --> 07:27.199
Mr. Xie.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.639
How many scholars are there
in Du County?

07:31.560 --> 07:33.639
Sir, you've just taken up your post.

07:33.839 --> 07:36.560
I've been here for only two months.

07:36.879 --> 07:38.319
You suddenly asked me...

07:38.319 --> 07:40.519
You make an estimate.

07:41.839 --> 07:42.759
Fifty scholars?

07:43.279 --> 07:44.600
There definitely are more than that.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.000
Du County has
a strong scholastic atmosphere.

07:47.319 --> 07:48.759
I guess there are four

07:49.079 --> 07:50.759
or five hundred scholars.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.399
Four or five hundred people?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.600
Arrest them all and interrogate them.

08:06.199 --> 08:07.480
Please think twice about it.

08:07.639 --> 08:08.920
It's illegitimate.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.639
I know.

08:13.639 --> 08:15.920
But this case is too strange.

08:17.959 --> 08:20.040
What legitimate method do you have?

08:20.240 --> 08:20.839
Well...

08:22.759 --> 08:23.399
Sir,

08:23.519 --> 08:24.600
in my opinion,

08:25.040 --> 08:27.360
we should report to the prefecture

08:27.680 --> 08:29.000
and ask for guidance from the prefect.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
Good idea.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.279
We'll wait for the guidance.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.759
Mr. Xie, you draft the report.

08:42.159 --> 08:42.960
Sir, wait.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.679
The Hunter Squad lost Captain Leng.

08:46.879 --> 08:47.759
According to the practice,

08:48.519 --> 08:50.399
Captain Yi of Executer Squad
shall supervise

08:51.120 --> 08:52.000
Hunter Squad.

08:53.279 --> 08:54.240
You deal with it.

09:10.840 --> 09:11.759
Leave me alone.

09:55.759 --> 09:56.399
Master.

09:57.919 --> 09:59.240
Who made the first move?

10:02.799 --> 10:03.960
Answer me.

10:04.720 --> 10:05.320
It's him.

10:05.759 --> 10:06.519
Zhang Laosan,

10:07.080 --> 10:07.919
you go first.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.919
Yes, Captain Leng.

10:10.519 --> 10:13.080
A few days ago, I arrested a ruffian.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.039
A ruffian?

10:14.120 --> 10:15.559
What were his charges?

10:15.840 --> 10:16.720
Provoking troubles.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.080
Resisting arrest.

10:18.360 --> 10:18.919
Any problem?

10:20.320 --> 10:21.159
Zhang Laosan,

10:21.480 --> 10:22.320
go on.

10:22.919 --> 10:24.120
It was no big deal.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.480
He should be detained for days.

10:25.879 --> 10:26.960
However,

10:27.240 --> 10:29.000
Sangeng must release him today.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.639
Luckily, I was there.

10:30.919 --> 10:32.000
I stopped him.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
He started a fight.

10:35.080 --> 10:35.759
Sangeng,

10:36.600 --> 10:37.879
what do you say?

10:37.879 --> 10:39.399
He insulted me first.

10:39.399 --> 10:40.600
You insulted me first.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.159
You insulted me first.

10:48.159 --> 10:48.799
Take this.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.879
Go to see a doctor.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.039
Sangeng will give you an explanation.

10:54.799 --> 10:55.480
Captain Leng,

10:55.679 --> 10:56.559
why bother?

10:56.919 --> 10:57.840
Just a minor injury.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.679
Just take it.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.480
Thank you.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.279
You started the fight,

11:25.320 --> 11:26.960
yet you got hit by him.

11:28.919 --> 11:29.679
Let me see.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.600
Have you got injured anywhere else?

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
No big deal.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.159
Well,

11:40.919 --> 11:42.360
my shoulder is dislocated.

11:42.559 --> 11:43.360
Dislocated?

11:45.240 --> 11:46.440
You did it.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.480
Zhang Laosan is wicked.

11:54.159 --> 11:55.240
Tell me about it.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.000
He arrested a widow's son.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.080
Someone bribed him
for the widow's property.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.720
He arrested the widow's son

12:03.440 --> 12:04.960
and forced her to sign an IOU.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.080
Then, he'll sue her in the Yamen,

12:07.759 --> 12:10.120
trying to seize her house
to repay her debt.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.240
The widow is weak.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.000
She can't fight against them.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.240
Besides,

12:16.399 --> 12:18.720
her son has been detained
in prison as a hostage.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.279
Master, you knew it all?

12:22.879 --> 12:24.039
What do I know?

12:24.480 --> 12:25.440
I'm just guessing.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.679
But you always say it's easier

12:27.960 --> 12:29.879
for the man in power to do good deeds.

12:30.039 --> 12:32.279
You remember it quite clearly.

12:33.159 --> 12:34.679
What else do you remember?

12:37.000 --> 12:37.720
What is it?

12:38.360 --> 12:41.159
Don't cut off people's livelihood.

12:47.159 --> 12:47.879
Master.

12:48.279 --> 12:51.039
My job is not to help people get rich,

12:51.720 --> 12:52.960
but to uphold justice.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.919
Can you uphold justice like this?

12:58.240 --> 12:58.879
For justice,

13:00.399 --> 13:02.399
it's a long way to go.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.399
I don't understand.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.279
You think about it.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.679
Zhang Laosan is
not the only one involved.

13:12.919 --> 13:14.000
There must be someone else.

13:14.879 --> 13:15.559
Someone else?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.559
I have rules to investigate a case.

13:32.039 --> 13:34.279
I know how to approach the case

13:34.519 --> 13:35.720
of Captain Leng.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.000
I just want to know how.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.960
How do you handle cases?

13:45.039 --> 13:46.279
According to Captain Leng,

13:46.279 --> 13:49.279
visit the scene and the victim's family,
find out the track,

13:49.639 --> 13:51.720
and ask for help from gangsters.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.360
Alright, let's talk about the details.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.720
You were the first
to arrive at the scene.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.519
Captain Leng has a wife.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.279
As his apprentice,

14:06.279 --> 14:08.320
you know Captain Leng's tracks best.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.559
As for gangsters,

14:12.320 --> 14:14.919
you usually rely on them
to investigate cases.

14:15.639 --> 14:16.639
But I'm afraid

14:16.879 --> 14:19.000
we are not able to instruct them.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.639
In the past,
they only listened to Captain Leng.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.960
We couldn't order them
without Captain Leng's permission.

14:26.720 --> 14:27.559
In other words,

14:28.080 --> 14:29.480
Captain Leng often

14:29.960 --> 14:32.360
intervened in others' business.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.200
Captain Leng

14:33.200 --> 14:35.440
is serious at work.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.759
You heard him.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.240
I'm afraid

14:39.559 --> 14:42.320
there's nothing we can do.

14:42.559 --> 14:43.240
Captain Yi.

14:43.559 --> 14:45.480
I can investigate it myself.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.759
But could you send
several experienced men

14:49.159 --> 14:50.960
to Qijia Village

14:50.960 --> 14:51.799
to find out

14:51.799 --> 14:53.840
if anyone saw or heard anything?

14:53.840 --> 14:55.519
I will do that.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.559
Who will you send?

14:59.759 --> 15:00.639
Qu Sangeng.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.879
Don't push your luck.

15:03.879 --> 15:06.080
Do I need to tell you?

15:06.399 --> 15:08.360
Your Master is dead.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.879
Are you still being arrogant?

15:15.000 --> 15:15.679
Shicong.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.000
These men are from the Executer Squad.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.840
Where are our men?

15:22.320 --> 15:23.559
They are all outside.

15:24.159 --> 15:25.519
It's the Hunter Squad's watchhouse.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.799
Call them in.

15:27.799 --> 15:28.360
Sure.

15:42.679 --> 15:43.279
How dare you.

15:56.279 --> 15:57.120
What happened?

15:58.240 --> 15:59.120
What do you mean?

16:00.200 --> 16:00.879
Captain Yi.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.799
You are now the leader of two squads.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.840
You got more prestigious.

16:08.159 --> 16:09.240
You're better than me.

16:09.799 --> 16:11.159
Just speak your mind.

16:12.759 --> 16:15.200
I just want
to discuss the case with you.

16:16.039 --> 16:17.399
Until now,

16:17.799 --> 16:20.159
I can't think of a suspect.

16:20.159 --> 16:22.519
Shouldn't you work on it yourself?

16:22.519 --> 16:23.679
No offense.

16:24.399 --> 16:25.480
Don't take it seriously.

16:26.639 --> 16:27.919
As it stands now,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.120
you are the only one

16:30.120 --> 16:33.000
who seems to benefit
from my Master's death.

16:35.279 --> 16:36.159
You're bold.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.919
But I'm afraid

16:39.320 --> 16:40.840
you'll lose your job.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.960
Calm down, Captain Yi.

16:42.320 --> 16:45.399
After my master's death,
you're going to kick me out?

16:46.360 --> 16:47.759
People will be suspicious.

16:48.639 --> 16:49.559
Arrest him.

16:49.559 --> 16:50.759
You have no right.

16:50.759 --> 16:51.200
What?

16:51.200 --> 16:52.639
Calm down.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.519
We are all brothers.

16:55.759 --> 16:57.080
Listen to me.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.759
A fight will get us in trouble.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.600
Everyone knows

17:01.600 --> 17:02.919
about Mr. Song.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.119
He will torture us before interrogation.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.319
Put it away.

17:09.119 --> 17:09.759
Captain Yi.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.880
Don't be mad.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.079
Please forgive him.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.079
Sangeng, kneel now

17:17.079 --> 17:18.440
and apologize.

18:11.839 --> 18:12.680
Gui'er.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.240
Sangeng.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.279
Come in.

18:20.839 --> 18:22.440
Only my mother and I are home now.

18:22.559 --> 18:23.680
I won't invite you to go inside.

18:28.319 --> 18:29.400
Let's talk here.

18:36.759 --> 18:37.640
- Master...
- Father...

18:39.519 --> 18:40.400
Sangeng.

18:40.839 --> 18:42.400
Since the postmortem is done,

18:44.119 --> 18:45.160
just tell me

18:46.440 --> 18:48.279
how my father died exactly.

18:49.000 --> 18:49.839
The coroner said

18:51.799 --> 18:53.240
he was hanged to death.

18:53.880 --> 18:54.519
Where?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.839
The body was found

18:58.359 --> 19:00.240
in the fields of Qijia Village.

19:01.319 --> 19:02.559
He ran errands

19:03.119 --> 19:04.000
without you?

19:05.359 --> 19:06.599
We had no work yesterday.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.519
I was in the Yamen.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.160
Master left in the afternoon.

19:14.079 --> 19:15.680
I don't know where he went.

19:18.240 --> 19:18.920
Gui'er.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.480
Is there anything I can do for you?

19:22.480 --> 19:23.319
Sangeng.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.519
My mother and I are women.

19:25.839 --> 19:26.640
My brother is little.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.920
When we conduct a funeral,

19:29.799 --> 19:31.279
I will need your help.

19:31.599 --> 19:32.519
I see.

19:33.119 --> 19:36.319
Now there's only one thing you can do.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.079
What is it?

19:41.960 --> 19:43.079
Catch the murderer

19:45.079 --> 19:46.319
and avenge my father's death.

19:47.759 --> 19:48.799
Sangeng, trust me.

19:48.799 --> 19:50.400
We are with you in this.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.920
We will avenge Captain Leng's death.

19:52.039 --> 19:54.480
Jin has gone
to Qijia Village to investigate it.

19:54.519 --> 19:56.680
This is the Hunter Squad after all.

19:57.119 --> 19:58.799
Gangsters don't listen to others.

19:58.839 --> 19:59.920
You'll have to go yourself.

20:01.599 --> 20:02.480
Honestly,

20:03.720 --> 20:05.000
I don't trust them.

20:05.559 --> 20:06.559
Why?

20:08.319 --> 20:10.960
Their words are a mix
of truth and falsehood.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.559
That's not the point.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.319
I haven't figured out

20:16.519 --> 20:19.039
if they benefit from Master's death.

20:21.279 --> 20:22.799
What good does it do

20:23.200 --> 20:25.759
for them?

20:28.599 --> 20:30.039
It's still hard to say.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.519
I have to go to see them.

20:32.759 --> 20:33.480
However,

20:34.440 --> 20:36.759
we have to find some clues first.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.279
(Wulei School)
Remember this place?

20:39.279 --> 20:40.079
(Wulei School)

20:40.079 --> 20:41.039
(Wulei School)
Guess what?

20:41.279 --> 20:42.759
When I was 15,

20:43.000 --> 20:44.279
I made a vow

20:44.759 --> 20:47.440
I would never come back here.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.839
School's finished.

20:51.480 --> 20:52.119
Go home.

20:58.279 --> 21:00.440
I was as happy as them after school.

21:01.680 --> 21:05.000
Do you want to know about
"My principle is unified"?

21:05.319 --> 21:06.680
Yes.

21:07.079 --> 21:08.200
This is

21:08.680 --> 21:10.279
from The Analects of Confucius.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.839
That's what Confucius said to Zengzi.

21:14.519 --> 21:16.319
Confucius meant

21:16.319 --> 21:20.039
his thought was consistent.

21:20.559 --> 21:22.279
According to Zhu Xi,

21:22.799 --> 21:26.000
the sage sticks to one principle.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.599
So what did Confucius try to say?

21:36.200 --> 21:37.559
Well,

21:39.000 --> 21:40.896
(Loyalty, Forgiveness)
it means loyalty and forgiveness.

21:41.559 --> 21:43.400
So what's the implication?

21:43.559 --> 21:44.920
According to Zhu Xi,

21:45.839 --> 21:47.200
be loyal

21:47.920 --> 21:49.440
and forgiving from the inside.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.000
(Forgiveness)

21:50.000 --> 21:52.319
Loyalty means being wholehearted.

21:52.599 --> 21:55.920
Forgiveness means being considerate.

21:59.119 --> 22:01.000
Well said.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.200
Mr. Wang.

22:05.519 --> 22:08.519
Can the thought be used to kill people?

22:08.599 --> 22:10.640
What makes you say that?

22:10.799 --> 22:14.160
The sage's thoughts are meant
to guide and transform people.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.519
How could it be used to murder?

22:16.839 --> 22:19.160
Why not?

22:20.119 --> 22:20.680
Uncle.

22:21.559 --> 22:22.640
But how?

22:23.640 --> 22:24.400
Don't be rude.

22:24.599 --> 22:25.400
Kezhui.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.039
You're a scholar.

22:28.559 --> 22:31.640
How could you misinterpret the classics?

22:31.759 --> 22:33.599
If the authorities heard this,

22:33.880 --> 22:35.319
they would strip you of academic honors.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.680
Uncle.

22:38.119 --> 22:39.759
I just want to tell them

22:40.440 --> 22:42.480
if they solve the case
through the classics,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.279
it can't be done
via current interpretation.

22:44.759 --> 22:45.440
You turkey.

22:46.119 --> 22:48.119
Can you be more specific?

22:48.519 --> 22:49.680
Be quiet, puppy.

22:49.839 --> 22:51.759
I'm here for my uncle.

22:52.680 --> 22:53.640
My interpretation

22:53.920 --> 22:54.759
is unconventional.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.000
If it angers my uncle,

22:56.000 --> 22:57.200
you two can't help me.

22:58.119 --> 22:58.680
Uncle.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.000
Please wait a moment.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.440
I'll be right back.

23:05.160 --> 23:05.759
Kezhui.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.519
You wait here.

23:14.839 --> 23:15.480
You turkey.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.480
Tell us your unconventional theory.

23:17.960 --> 23:18.519
Hold on.

23:19.079 --> 23:19.720
Sangeng.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.519
Why did you call him turkey?

23:22.759 --> 23:23.759
My surname is Feng.

23:23.759 --> 23:25.759
[*Feng indicates Phoenix, related to Turkey.]

23:25.759 --> 23:26.599
Feng Kezhui?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
I have heard of you.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.240
They all say that you're...

23:30.599 --> 23:31.240
A talented man?

23:32.240 --> 23:33.160
A crazy scholar.

23:36.240 --> 23:36.960
You flatter me.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.200
Turkey, don't be modest.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.200
We are here to find clues.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.240
It's a murder case.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.240
Just speak your mind.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.119
I have one question.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.720
Were the words left by the criminal?

23:50.000 --> 23:50.640
Exactly.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.160
By the murderer.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.359
Liren Chapter consists of 26 sentences,

23:56.759 --> 23:58.200
with more than 600 characters.

23:58.519 --> 24:00.240
It talks about benevolence

24:01.279 --> 24:03.599
and does not instruct
who should be killed.

24:04.200 --> 24:04.920
Therefore,

24:05.640 --> 24:07.880
it has nothing to do with the murder.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.200
The criminal read the sage's book,

24:11.839 --> 24:14.720
and deliberately left the words
after his crime.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.359
He must be a cynic.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.680
It means he doesn't

24:20.960 --> 24:22.119
believe in the classics,

24:24.119 --> 24:25.119
adhere to the rites,

24:26.200 --> 24:27.119
or acknowledge the sages.

24:29.839 --> 24:30.960
This is a provocation.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.599
He is mocking the sages.

24:34.920 --> 24:35.519
Kezhui.

24:38.240 --> 24:38.920
Uncle.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.480
Here is rice.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.079
You take it.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.079
How did you know

24:46.599 --> 24:49.319
I have nothing to eat?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.920
What else could you be here for?

24:55.000 --> 24:55.680
You turkey.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.039
Can you say it now?

24:58.599 --> 24:59.240
Say what?

25:00.160 --> 25:02.039
Your twisted interpretation.

25:03.559 --> 25:05.359
You tell me the case first.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.319
I won't.

25:07.599 --> 25:10.200
If you know the case,
you'll go along with it.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.559
It will be far-fetched.

25:13.319 --> 25:14.319
I just want to know

25:14.400 --> 25:15.960
how much you can do.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.160
Well, I can tell you.

25:19.279 --> 25:20.160
However...

25:22.079 --> 25:22.799
What?

25:24.279 --> 25:25.400
How can I say it

25:25.559 --> 25:27.319
on the street?

25:30.759 --> 25:31.400
You turkey.

25:31.920 --> 25:32.759
Now say it.

25:35.200 --> 25:35.839
Hello.

25:35.960 --> 25:36.759
Coming.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.880
Sir, what would you like to have?

25:39.240 --> 25:40.880
Three trays of steamed buns,

25:41.240 --> 25:43.680
three plates of pancakes,
and three bowls of noodles.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.640
No need to order for us.

25:46.519 --> 25:47.559
I didn't.

25:49.279 --> 25:51.839
Besides, serve one bowl of noodles
at a time.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.720
When I'm almost finished,

25:53.720 --> 25:54.680
serve the next one.

25:55.240 --> 25:55.799
Okay.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.960
I also need fragrant melon,

25:58.960 --> 25:59.920
fermented soybeans,

25:59.920 --> 26:01.680
fresh peppercorns,

26:02.359 --> 26:04.079
garlic, garlic juice, and spiced pork.

26:04.599 --> 26:05.240
Alright.

26:09.000 --> 26:09.599
Please.

26:47.839 --> 26:49.559
I don't want to owe you.

26:49.799 --> 26:51.640
So I will tell you

26:51.640 --> 26:52.799
about my interpretation.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.720
When we found the corpse...

26:55.920 --> 26:57.119
As you said,

26:57.400 --> 26:59.640
I shouldn't know about the case.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.440
I have one question.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.160
You discovered the body

27:03.680 --> 27:04.880
inside a room

27:05.079 --> 27:07.039
or in broad daylight?

27:07.279 --> 27:08.720
In broad daylight.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.240
Revengeful murder.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.400
Deep-seated hatred.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.720
Murderer suffered an injustice.

27:16.079 --> 27:17.559
He wants the world to know it.

27:18.319 --> 27:19.319
Why do you think so?

27:22.279 --> 27:23.640
If you were wronged,

27:24.119 --> 27:25.039
what would you do?

27:26.519 --> 27:27.160
I would

27:28.039 --> 27:28.759
cry.

27:31.240 --> 27:31.720
Right.

27:32.440 --> 27:33.960
Would you scream?

27:34.880 --> 27:37.160
So, did the murderer scream?

27:37.279 --> 27:37.960
He did.

27:38.519 --> 27:39.680
How come I didn't hear?

27:40.119 --> 27:42.519
Sages may sigh or reason

27:43.440 --> 27:45.559
under the rites.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.839
But this one is different.

27:48.039 --> 27:49.400
What's different?

27:49.920 --> 27:52.640
It could be spoken out loud,

27:52.880 --> 27:54.559
like a cry from the top.

27:56.119 --> 27:57.440
My principle is unified.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.440
My principle is unified.

27:59.599 --> 28:01.519
My principle is unified.

28:08.359 --> 28:09.799
When you are wronged,

28:10.000 --> 28:11.640
don't you want to vent it out?

28:12.039 --> 28:13.319
What else?

28:13.640 --> 28:15.119
The murderer was being sarcastic.

28:16.559 --> 28:17.400
Sarcastic?

28:19.920 --> 28:21.599
He wanted to tell everyone

28:22.119 --> 28:25.200
that the victim was a man
of disloyalty and impiety.

28:25.319 --> 28:26.680
What does it mean?

28:27.839 --> 28:29.880
That depends on who the victim is.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.759
The victim is my master.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.359
Puppy.

28:46.359 --> 28:47.400
No need to console me.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.599
Tell me

28:52.279 --> 28:53.960
what disloyalty and impiety mean.

28:55.519 --> 28:56.480
As an officer,

28:57.680 --> 28:58.680
what do you think?

29:00.960 --> 29:02.319
Upholding justice

29:03.119 --> 29:04.599
and pleading for the people.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.680
So, malpractice means disloyalty

29:07.079 --> 29:08.759
and taking human life lightly
means impiety.

29:09.119 --> 29:09.880
Nonsense.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.000
It's what the murderer implied.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.920
How can you take it seriously?

29:17.920 --> 29:18.519
Sangeng.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.640
Turkey.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.720
I shouldn't be angry.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.480
Spit it out.

29:34.839 --> 29:35.759
I won't be mad.

29:39.720 --> 29:40.799
Whether you are mad or not,

29:41.720 --> 29:42.960
I will tell the truth.

29:43.559 --> 29:44.519
He killed someone.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.440
Does he have to lie?

29:46.680 --> 29:50.759
Why didn't he write more

29:51.279 --> 29:52.880
about his story?

29:53.359 --> 29:55.000
Why didn't he file a lawsuit?

29:55.559 --> 29:56.680
He couldn't.

29:57.519 --> 29:58.920
He knew he couldn't win,

29:59.640 --> 30:02.680
so he chose to take revenge
by killing the person.

30:09.319 --> 30:11.000
I absolutely won't believe

30:11.200 --> 30:12.480
Master harmed someone.

30:14.200 --> 30:14.960
Actually,

30:16.079 --> 30:17.599
I hope I'm guessing wrong.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.559
I have to start
with the old cases my master handled.

30:25.685 --> 30:38.592
(Archive Room)

31:08.359 --> 31:09.119
Mr. Song.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.319
Qu Sangeng.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.359
How long have you been a bailiff?

31:17.359 --> 31:20.240
(Auxiliary bailiffs, non-formal bailiffs)
One-year auxiliary bailiff and four-year bailiff.

31:20.240 --> 31:21.759
How many homicide cases

31:22.839 --> 31:24.440
have you handled with your master?

31:25.000 --> 31:25.880
Thirty-seven cases.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.119
What kind of cases?

31:29.279 --> 31:30.720
Twenty-six fighting cases,

31:31.039 --> 31:32.400
six murders and robberies,

31:32.640 --> 31:33.559
and three rape cases.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.519
One domestic murder.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.279
A debtor was killed

31:38.400 --> 31:39.640
and buried in the wilderness.

31:42.000 --> 31:42.920
How many cases were solved?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.160
Half of the fighting cases were solved.

31:45.759 --> 31:47.119
The rest are suspended.

31:47.559 --> 31:49.440
One robbery and rape case was solved.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.920
The last two cases were solved.

31:53.039 --> 31:56.000
The two premeditated murder cases
were both cracked.

31:56.240 --> 31:56.880
That's right.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.680
Do you know why?

31:59.440 --> 32:00.119
Well...

32:02.240 --> 32:03.720
I never thought about it.

32:08.559 --> 32:09.559
The cases you investigated

32:10.279 --> 32:11.240
are the real cases.

32:12.759 --> 32:15.319
Uninvestigated cases are not cases.

32:19.599 --> 32:20.519
If it's not a case,

32:22.319 --> 32:23.920
can you find it in the files?

32:29.079 --> 32:31.559
Do you believe in accidental drowning?

32:31.559 --> 32:34.559
An accidental fall in the well?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.519
Accidental death of abrupt illness?

32:37.519 --> 32:39.000
Some people hung themselves

32:39.000 --> 32:40.640
because their land was seized

32:40.640 --> 32:41.960
and their families were bullied.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.359
And those undiscovered victims?

32:45.799 --> 32:46.559
Two cases?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.279
In such a huge county,

32:49.799 --> 32:50.920
with 200,000 people,

32:52.039 --> 32:54.559
only two premeditated murders
in five years?

32:55.279 --> 32:56.240
Can you believe it?

32:57.480 --> 32:58.839
So, you mean

33:00.279 --> 33:02.000
we have missed many cases?

33:02.599 --> 33:03.400
Missed?

33:08.039 --> 33:09.000
If someone died,

33:09.720 --> 33:12.599
who could decide

33:14.279 --> 33:15.200
if it's a murder case?

33:18.960 --> 33:19.440
My master.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.160
Your master.

33:21.880 --> 33:22.960
My master was killed

33:24.200 --> 33:25.839
because some case was

33:26.759 --> 33:27.680
missed out?

33:30.440 --> 33:31.480
I said so much.

33:32.599 --> 33:34.000
Are you still pretending?

33:34.640 --> 33:36.079
I really don't understand.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.039
You think about it carefully.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.599
I'll take my leave.

33:50.236 --> 33:52.384
(Constable of Du County)

34:13.639 --> 34:14.280
Sangeng.

34:17.760 --> 34:19.559
Captain Leng's badge?

34:20.800 --> 34:23.679
Captain Leng left the Yamen
in the afternoon.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.239
He didn't take his badge.

34:26.039 --> 34:27.239
He wasn't on official duty?

34:32.320 --> 34:32.880
Right.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.280
He definitely wasn't.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.480
Wait. Where are you going?

34:39.639 --> 34:40.719
I thought of a place.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.320
Master might go there
the day before yesterday.

34:42.320 --> 34:42.880
Where?

34:43.360 --> 34:43.920
Come with me.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.400
Alright.

34:51.908 --> 34:52.840
(Cuihua Tower)

34:52.840 --> 34:53.519
Sangeng.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.480
Do you know about this place?

34:57.639 --> 34:58.320
It's a brothel.

34:58.679 --> 34:59.639
You mean

35:00.320 --> 35:01.960
Captain Leng

35:02.199 --> 35:03.800
visited this brothel back then?

35:07.960 --> 35:08.679
Shicong.

35:09.639 --> 35:11.800
I brought you here to help me

35:12.159 --> 35:14.840
in case I overlooked any clues.

35:15.559 --> 35:18.440
But if you tell someone else about this

35:19.159 --> 35:20.800
and damage Master's reputation,

35:20.800 --> 35:23.679
I will never let you off.

35:27.039 --> 35:27.639
Sangeng.

35:28.920 --> 35:29.679
Relax.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.440
Everyone in the Yamen knows

35:31.639 --> 35:33.960
that I am very astute.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.519
Well,

35:38.480 --> 35:40.440
I can swear.

35:42.639 --> 35:43.880
I swear

35:44.599 --> 35:47.440
if I tell anyone else about today,

35:47.679 --> 35:49.480
I'll die in a gutter.

35:52.519 --> 35:53.559
I mean it.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.360
It's okay?

36:00.360 --> 36:00.760
Let's go.

36:00.760 --> 36:01.360
Hold on.

36:03.079 --> 36:05.920
Are we going in official uniforms?

36:09.440 --> 36:10.400
Any advice?

36:10.719 --> 36:12.039
Go in through the back door.

36:12.639 --> 36:13.280
Back door?

36:15.880 --> 36:17.960
You're so familiar with the brothel?

36:25.480 --> 36:26.559
Who is this?

36:31.079 --> 36:32.000
Sir.

36:33.519 --> 36:34.480
What brings you here?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.400
There weren't any burglaries here.

36:39.079 --> 36:39.960
Sui Laosan.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.360
Wake up.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.119
Don't you recognize me?

36:45.239 --> 36:46.400
Sangeng.

36:47.440 --> 36:48.880
I was drowsy.

36:49.960 --> 36:50.800
Sangeng,

36:50.800 --> 36:52.599
why are you here so early today?

36:53.440 --> 36:54.480
Has Ms. Lin gotten up?

36:56.719 --> 36:57.679
She has.

37:08.280 --> 37:09.599
Please follow me.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.119
Alright.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.480
Please come in.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.239
Welcome.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.280
Have a seat.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.719
Ms. Lin.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.280
You're too kind.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.320
Mr. Gao is a friend.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.000
Just act as usual.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.000
A friend.

37:43.599 --> 37:44.320
Yes.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.079
I'll cut right to the chase.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.039
Sangeng.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.800
You suddenly came.

37:53.360 --> 37:54.880
Any emergency?

37:57.199 --> 37:58.559
Not really.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.320
Master is supposed to come.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.039
But he is busy with official business.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.519
So he sent me here.

38:04.599 --> 38:05.880
What for?

38:07.039 --> 38:08.639
Master's pouch is missing.

38:08.719 --> 38:09.880
There's a file inside.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.079
He came here before.

38:12.079 --> 38:13.519
He asked me to ask you

38:13.519 --> 38:15.199
if you saw it.

38:16.760 --> 38:19.480
The file must be important.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.079
Very important.

38:23.199 --> 38:24.440
How heavy is it?

38:27.199 --> 38:29.719
It should be very heavy.

38:31.159 --> 38:32.760
Ms. Lin, that's funny.

38:34.119 --> 38:35.119
I'm not joking.

38:35.639 --> 38:36.840
If it weren't that heavy,

38:36.840 --> 38:38.079
why would you

38:38.559 --> 38:40.239
need a helper to come here

38:40.800 --> 38:41.920
with you?

38:42.639 --> 38:43.599
Sangeng.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.679
When I met your Master,

38:47.199 --> 38:48.519
you hadn't even been born.

38:48.639 --> 38:49.679
Well,

38:51.880 --> 38:52.840
you cannot fool me.

38:55.639 --> 38:57.679
Tell me the truth.

38:58.519 --> 39:02.079
Why are you here today?

39:05.039 --> 39:05.880
Something happened

39:08.679 --> 39:09.559
to Master.

39:12.679 --> 39:13.840
What happened?

39:16.559 --> 39:17.199
Master...

39:20.480 --> 39:21.199
He is dead.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.199
What did you say?

39:34.199 --> 39:35.199
He is dead.

39:37.679 --> 39:38.639
How?

39:39.199 --> 39:40.320
He was murdered.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.119
When?

39:44.400 --> 39:45.840
When did this happen?

39:46.679 --> 39:47.776
The day before yesterday.

39:49.880 --> 39:50.976
The day before yesterday?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.920
He was here the day before yesterday.

39:55.679 --> 39:57.599
He must have been killed

39:59.199 --> 39:59.960
after he left here.

40:13.159 --> 40:13.760
Both of you,

40:14.800 --> 40:16.599
please leave me alone for a moment.

40:19.800 --> 40:20.960
Please come back later.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.320
Why?

40:58.320 --> 40:58.960
Sangeng.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.039
You are familiar with Ms. Lin?

41:02.800 --> 41:04.519
I often delivered letters for Master.

41:05.199 --> 41:06.519
If he got drunk,

41:06.679 --> 41:07.679
I would pick him up.

41:07.679 --> 41:09.360
Why didn't you ask her directly

41:09.599 --> 41:11.320
if Captain Leng was here that afternoon?

41:11.800 --> 41:13.039
It's inappropriate.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.159
What if she had something to do
with Master's death?

41:16.920 --> 41:17.840
Do you suspect her?

41:25.360 --> 41:27.280
I'm not sure if I should suspect her.

41:27.559 --> 41:30.079
Therefore, I can't trust her readily.

41:31.079 --> 41:31.679
Sir.

41:32.559 --> 41:33.920
Why are you two here?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.480
Ms. Lin is looking for you.

41:36.519 --> 41:37.320
Please follow me.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.400
Your Master was here
the day before yesterday.

41:44.559 --> 41:45.719
As usual.

41:47.760 --> 41:49.480
Nothing seemed to be bothering him.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.559
I've known your master for years.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.280
I can tell when he was troubled.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.079
Ms. Lin,

42:03.559 --> 42:04.880
think carefully.

42:06.079 --> 42:07.519
Any strange things?

42:10.039 --> 42:11.679
It really was as usual.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.079
He said something

42:19.880 --> 42:21.519
about the new county magistrate.

42:21.679 --> 42:24.960
He said
the magistrate is a cat official.

42:25.760 --> 42:26.519
A cat official?

42:27.519 --> 42:28.559
What is a cat official?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.400
Wuji served as a constable
for over 20 years.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.639
He's served many magistrates.

42:34.660 --> 42:35.559
He categorized officials

42:36.480 --> 42:39.559
into five types of wolves, dogs,
snakes, rats, and cats.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.079
Wolves are the most ruthless and greedy.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.280
Dogs,

42:45.760 --> 42:47.320
whether they are greedy or not,

42:47.320 --> 42:49.400
they keep a tight rein
on their households.

42:49.760 --> 42:52.679
Subordinates have hardly any chance
for personal gain.

42:54.440 --> 42:57.199
Snakes are spineless but most venomous.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.079
However, snakes climb the fastest.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.760
Rats are cunning and greedy.

43:05.440 --> 43:08.559
They won't miss any minor benefits.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.400
And,

43:17.079 --> 43:17.880
cats...

43:19.559 --> 43:21.559
My master said

43:21.559 --> 43:22.800
cats are the best.

43:23.079 --> 43:23.760
Well,

43:24.400 --> 43:25.679
cats like to be stroked.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.559
Once stroked, they become tame.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.199
And besides playing, they sleep.

43:30.679 --> 43:32.199
They spend most of their time sleeping.

43:32.719 --> 43:34.400
Aren't cats good at catching rats?

43:34.559 --> 43:37.760
Sir, you probably never had a cat.

43:38.079 --> 43:40.079
I have several cats now.

43:40.239 --> 43:42.480
If you feed them enough,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.079
they won't catch mice.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.559
They will capture one

43:47.400 --> 43:48.679
for the sake of appearance.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.199
I see.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.320
Good point.

43:56.079 --> 43:56.960
Ms. Lin.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.480
When did he leave?

44:00.079 --> 44:01.320
He left before dark.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.039
(5 PM)
Around 5 PM.

44:04.440 --> 44:05.239
5 PM?

44:06.239 --> 44:07.519
You sure?

44:08.199 --> 44:09.039
Yes.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.079
Before dark,

44:12.679 --> 44:14.960
many guests will come.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.320
Did he say where he was going,

44:17.800 --> 44:19.440
and if there are any other matters?

44:19.920 --> 44:21.719
He just told me he was going home.

44:23.440 --> 44:25.079
That's all I can think of now.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.519
If possible, we'll come again.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.000
If you think of anything,

44:30.079 --> 44:31.800
you can find me in the Yamen.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.079
We'll take our leave.

44:40.239 --> 44:40.840
Sangeng.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.920
You give this to your master's wife.

45:12.400 --> 45:12.960
Well...

45:13.840 --> 45:15.559
Ms. Lin, I...

45:15.840 --> 45:17.280
Just do what I said.

45:19.079 --> 45:20.559
Your master is dead.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.719
His family

45:23.559 --> 45:24.800
must be helpless.

45:26.519 --> 45:27.400
But...

45:27.719 --> 45:30.159
If she asks where this money comes from,

45:30.559 --> 45:33.440
then what should I say?

45:37.159 --> 45:39.440
Just say it's given by Mr. Xue.

45:39.639 --> 45:40.559
Many years ago,

45:41.119 --> 45:43.719
Mr. Xue owed your master a big favor.

45:43.719 --> 45:44.440
Ms. Lin,

45:45.400 --> 45:47.079
thank you.

45:47.440 --> 45:48.360
Your master

45:48.599 --> 45:50.320
has always regarded you as his son.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.440
Don't let him down.

45:55.239 --> 45:56.039
Ms. Lin.

45:57.639 --> 45:58.639
I promise.

46:01.079 --> 46:02.920
Master was going home,

46:03.360 --> 46:05.800
but his body was found outside the city.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.920
He left here at 5 PM.

46:10.159 --> 46:11.800
The city gate was about to be closed.

46:12.920 --> 46:14.880
The nearest gate is the east gate.

46:16.800 --> 46:19.800
The body was found ten miles
outside the east gate at Qijia Village.

46:20.920 --> 46:22.400
He must have left via the east gate.

46:23.719 --> 46:26.679
It takes half an hour at most from here
to the east gate.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.920
(Why did he leave at that time?)

46:31.920 --> 46:33.639
(The gate will be closed
before he's back.)

46:35.199 --> 46:38.159
(So Captain Leng
must have changed his mind here)

46:38.159 --> 46:39.320
(to leave the city.)

47:00.400 --> 47:02.400
It must be due to something important.

47:15.559 --> 47:17.320
Could he have been ambushed here?

47:17.480 --> 47:18.519
It's secluded.

47:19.679 --> 47:20.320
No.

47:20.679 --> 47:22.440
The coroner said
that he was hanged to death.

47:23.239 --> 47:23.880
(Well,)

47:24.719 --> 47:26.519
(it's impossible to hang a man here.)

47:31.079 --> 47:33.480
(No matter who the murderer is,)

47:33.840 --> 47:36.119
(whether it's a sneak attack
or abduction,)

47:36.920 --> 47:38.239
(given Master's skills,)

47:39.039 --> 47:41.360
(there should be signs of struggle.)

48:02.079 --> 48:03.360
(I guess someone he knew)

48:04.719 --> 48:05.960
(was waiting for him.)

48:09.480 --> 48:12.000
He tricked Master out of the city.

48:12.480 --> 48:13.159
No.

48:14.039 --> 48:17.239
He must pass by the Yamen
from here to the east gate.

48:19.079 --> 48:21.440
(The on-duty Yamen runners would see him.)

48:26.239 --> 48:28.519
(How did he get out of the city?)

48:34.719 --> 48:35.519
Wait, Sangeng.
