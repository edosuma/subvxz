WEBVTT

00:07.574 --> 00:09.509
This is exactly
why I hate fix-ups.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.577
She's not coming.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.579
Just give her
a few more minutes.

00:12.579 --> 00:14.581
Come on,
tell me about the cabin.

00:14.581 --> 00:15.448
Oh, all right.
Uh...

00:15.448 --> 00:16.315
Well, Mom and Dad used

00:16.315 --> 00:18.385
to take us up there
when we were kids.

00:18.385 --> 00:19.386
Niles and I thought

00:19.386 --> 00:21.321
it might be a nice birthday gift
for Dad

00:21.321 --> 00:23.056
if we took him
up there again.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.424
Oh, this is ridiculous.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.925
I'm being stood up
on a blind date.

00:25.925 --> 00:26.926
I'm pathetic.

00:26.926 --> 00:27.894
You are so insecure.

00:27.894 --> 00:29.396
God, where does that come from?

00:29.396 --> 00:31.197
Jessica will be here.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.466
"Jessica"? I thought you said
her name was "Jennifer." Jennifer?

00:33.466 --> 00:35.402
Jennifer goes out
with a weatherman.

00:35.402 --> 00:36.836
She's way out of your league.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.738
Look, let me have
your cell phone.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.241
I'll call her
and see what's going on.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.710
Frasier?

00:43.710 --> 00:44.677
Oh, I'm sorry, Roz.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.946
The most striking woman
just came in.

00:46.946 --> 00:47.714
Well, it's probably Jessica.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.648
No, no, no,
it's not Jessica.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.016
She's with a man.

00:50.016 --> 00:52.786
God, I don't know
what it is about her.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.654
I can't take my eyes
off of her.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.122
Do you suppose they're a couple?

00:56.122 --> 00:57.357
No, no-- don't...!

00:57.357 --> 00:59.159
I'll tell you what--
you have to go

00:59.159 --> 01:01.094
over there for me and find out.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.295
What? You owe me.
Come on.

01:02.295 --> 01:04.563
All right, it's that table
right by the counter.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.965
Go on.
Oh, all right.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.934
(whispering loudly):
No, Roz, Roz.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.869
That's the wrong table.

01:09.869 --> 01:10.804
Excuse me.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.605
I know this is
a little weird,

01:12.605 --> 01:15.341
but my friend over there thinks
you're really, really cute.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.277
He wanted to know if
you two were on a date.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.612
"A date"? Oh, no,
Hank and I are just friends.

01:19.612 --> 01:21.748
ROZ:
Oh, that's good news.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.016
That's really
good news.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.017
Hi, Hank.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.351
I'm Roz Doyle.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.694
Uh, excuse me.

01:34.694 --> 01:36.729
Uh...

01:36.729 --> 01:39.732
I suppose you noticed I-I
was staring at your table,

01:39.732 --> 01:41.668
and I was just, uh,
wondering if, um...

01:41.668 --> 01:44.070
that gentlemen you're with,
i-is he your husband?

01:44.070 --> 01:44.971
Oh, no.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.539
Oh. Uh, boyfriend?

01:46.539 --> 01:47.373
No.

01:47.373 --> 01:48.675
Oh, wonderful.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.176
Would you like me
to introduce you?

01:50.176 --> 01:51.444
He just broke up
with someone.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.213
No, no-no-no, uh...

01:53.213 --> 01:57.050
no, I-I was, uh...
I was staring at you.

01:57.050 --> 01:57.851
You were?

01:57.851 --> 01:59.119
Yes.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.387
Gosh, I know this may
seem awfully bold of me.

02:01.387 --> 02:02.388
I-I'm not the sort of man

02:02.388 --> 02:04.891
who hits on every
woman he sees... Excuse me.

02:04.891 --> 02:08.328
Hi, um, your friend said
you wanted to know

02:08.328 --> 02:10.229
if I was single.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.432
It's okay-- you don't
have to be embarrassed.

02:12.432 --> 02:13.733
Yes, he does.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.168
(chuckling):
No.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.170
There's been
a little mistake.

02:17.170 --> 02:18.104
You see, I asked my friend

02:18.104 --> 02:19.572
to approach
this lovely woman,

02:19.572 --> 02:21.574
and she obviously mistook you
for the woman I meant.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.576
Well, that's certainly
understandable,

02:23.576 --> 02:24.577
seeing as you're lovely
as well.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.579
You see, it's just that
at this moment, that's...

02:27.080 --> 02:28.014
Well, I'm, uh...
many apologies.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.082
(chuckling)

02:29.082 --> 02:30.083
Gosh, I'm sorry.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.084
Let me start again.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.051
I'm Frasier Crane.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.553
Oh, you're Frasier.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.022
Oh. Hi. I'm Jessica,
Roz's friend.

02:36.022 --> 02:37.457
Jessica.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.291
Roz thought

02:38.291 --> 02:39.993
we might hit it off.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.362
Indeed, we might have,
you see, if not for the fact

02:42.362 --> 02:44.364
that I've-I've just met
this, uh, woman

02:44.364 --> 02:45.865
to whom I'd be glad
to introduce you,

02:45.865 --> 02:47.867
except I-I don't know
what her name is yet, so, uh...

02:47.867 --> 02:50.370
You know,
Roz could explain all this.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.872
Uh, she's sitting over there
next to that scowling woman.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.241
(chuckles awkwardly)

02:55.241 --> 02:56.576
Gosh, you know,
you must think

02:56.576 --> 02:58.077
I'm some sort of
a smooth operator.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.579
No, not really.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.014
Ah.

03:01.014 --> 03:05.919
I-I really am...
terribly sorry, uh...

03:05.919 --> 03:07.887
I'm Mia,
Mia Preston.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.389
Mia...
Mia Preston?

03:09.389 --> 03:10.823
The children's
book author?

03:10.823 --> 03:12.592
Yes.
Oh, my goodness.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.860
Panda in the Parlor?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.328
Oh, wow, I love that book.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.197
I've read it a hundred times.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.064
I'm impressed.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.567
Most of my readers
can't even count that high.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.969
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I-I used to read it to my son.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.404
You know, many is
the quart of milk

03:24.404 --> 03:25.905
we poured in the backyard

03:25.905 --> 03:27.774
waiting for the
Oreo tree to grow.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.042
Gosh, you know, I'd...

03:29.042 --> 03:31.311
I'd love to take you
to lunch sometime.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.612
Lunch? Um...

03:32.612 --> 03:33.980
Well, all right, coffee?

03:33.980 --> 03:36.849
Anything. I-I'd just like a
chance to get to know you better.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.318
Well, I... okay.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.787
You're certainly persistent.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.755
Well, a wise woman
once wrote,

03:42.755 --> 03:44.757
"No cookie jar
is up too high

03:44.757 --> 03:47.260
for a panda who
will try and try."

03:47.260 --> 03:48.261
(chuckling)

03:48.261 --> 03:49.596
(chuckles nervously)

03:49.596 --> 03:51.431
Now you're scaring me.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.937
(door opens)

03:57.937 --> 03:59.405
MARTIN:
Hey, Daph.

04:00.873 --> 04:04.310
I see you're wearing
your buffet pants.

04:04.310 --> 04:05.645
They're hip waders.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.147
I'm breaking them in
for the weekend.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.549
Where's Fras?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.417
He's probably off somewhere
with that Mia.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.353
Oh, yeah, seems to be
getting serious, huh?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.688
You know, it's funny,
you can always tell.

04:15.688 --> 04:18.024
Starts using French words
for no reason.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.492
Yeah, and that laugh,
the giddy one.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.261
(both imitate giddy laugh)

04:21.261 --> 04:22.428
FRASIER:
After you, Niles.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.296
Thank you.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.364
Hello, all.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.366
Well, there's
afaux pasaverted.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.369
I almost wore
my big rubber pants today.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.005
They're for the trip.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.006
I'm nearly done packing.

04:33.006 --> 04:36.009
I've just got to get my
fly vest and my tackle box

04:36.009 --> 04:37.377
and there's
one more thing.

04:37.377 --> 04:39.646
Well, we're taking off
in a few hours, sodepeche-toi.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.448
Oh, yeah, earplugs
for the car ride up-- thank you.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.816
Oh, uh, Dad,
don't forget

04:43.816 --> 04:46.085
to pack some
sturdy knee socks.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.353
I should get some for myself.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.855
You remember
the insect situation

04:48.855 --> 04:50.123
at the cabin.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.391
Good Lord, Niles,

04:51.391 --> 04:53.359
not this bug phobia
of yours.

04:53.359 --> 04:54.827
It's not a phobia.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.829
The mosquitoes up there
are huge.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.332
My first summer, I was chased
off the end of the dock

04:59.332 --> 05:01.100
by one the size of a pelican.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.937
So, Dr. Crane,
when do we finally get to meet

05:04.937 --> 05:06.372
this new girlfriend of yours?
Oh, Mia.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.807
Well, she's on her way
over here right now.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.176
She says she's gonna take me
out to buy some new trousers.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.045
You see,
this new diet she's got me on...

05:12.045 --> 05:15.048
I've lost my love handles...
just when I needed them most.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.316
(laughing giddily)

05:17.984 --> 05:19.752
So, Niles, Niles,
you got those movies?

05:19.752 --> 05:21.688
Shh. Yes. Here they are.
Thank you.

05:21.688 --> 05:22.522
Movies?

05:22.522 --> 05:23.489
Yes, shh.
Shh-shh-shh.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.791
For Dad's birthday.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.626
We had some
of his old home movies

05:26.626 --> 05:28.127
transferred to videotape.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.563
God, you know, I haven't
seen these in years.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.831
You know, Daphne, it's gonna
be quite a hoot this weekend.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.033
You sure you don't
want to join us?

05:34.033 --> 05:35.668
(doorbell rings)
Gutting fish, watching home movies

05:35.668 --> 05:38.371
and hosing down
your father's pants...

05:38.371 --> 05:41.140
It does sound tempting.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.075
(laughing)

05:42.075 --> 05:43.076
Oh...

05:43.076 --> 05:44.077
Hi, honey.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.078
Hi, Mia.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.079
Hi.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.580
Gosh, come on in.
Come on in.

05:48.081 --> 05:48.915
This is
Daphne Moon.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.050
And that's
my brother, Niles.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.853
Oh, it's great
to finally meet you two.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.221
DAPHNE:
Likewise.

05:55.221 --> 05:56.222
So, what do you
got there?

05:56.723 --> 05:57.724
Oh, I baked some
fat-free goodies

05:57.724 --> 05:58.991
for your trip.

05:58.991 --> 05:59.759
Oh.
Where's the kitchen?

05:59.759 --> 06:00.760
Oh, right this way.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.261
And there's a
ton of muffins,

06:02.261 --> 06:03.763
if anybody
wants one.

06:03.763 --> 06:04.764
Oh, uh, not for me.

06:04.764 --> 06:06.566
I have some problems
with allergies.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.668
Really? Well, these are just
wheat germ, oat bran and carob.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.969
Oh, well,
throw in a sea scallop,

06:09.969 --> 06:11.904
you can call the paramedics
right now.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.343
She seems nice,
doesn't she?

06:17.343 --> 06:18.845
You all right,
Dr. Crane?

06:18.845 --> 06:21.347
I'm sorry, Daphne,
it's just that...

06:21.347 --> 06:23.850
Mia looks exactly
like our mother.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.351
Mrs. Crane?

06:25.351 --> 06:27.820
I've only seen photos,
mind, but

06:27.820 --> 06:29.756
now that you mention it,
there is a resemblance.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.257
No, it's not just
a resemblance.

06:31.257 --> 06:32.759
She is the spitting image.

06:32.759 --> 06:36.562
I'm... I'm shocked
Frasier didn't mention it.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.398
So, what do you
think of her?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.399
Oh...

06:39.399 --> 06:41.868
she's wonderful,
but, Frasier...

06:41.868 --> 06:42.835
Hmm?

06:44.704 --> 06:47.340
Does she remind
you of anyone?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.708
Oh, you noticed that, too?
Are you kidding?

06:48.708 --> 06:50.710
From the minute
I laid eyes on her.

06:50.710 --> 06:51.677
Even I can see it.

06:51.677 --> 06:53.646
Really? Well, she does
look a bit like Roz,

06:53.646 --> 06:55.081
but she's a totally
different person.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.449
You know,

06:56.449 --> 06:58.351
in fact,
our relationship is unlike

06:58.351 --> 07:00.353
any I've ever had before.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.320
Come on, handsome.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.822
Let's go buy you some pants.
Ooh, okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:14.434 --> 07:18.905
Oh, wow... look at this.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.841
I don't believe it.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.844
Nothing's changed.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.679
Niles?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.917
Wow, I don't believe it.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.921
Look at this, nothing's changed.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.889
It's character, Niles.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.891
Look at this fireplace.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.893
Ah, your mom and I
used to sit

07:40.893 --> 07:43.863
in front of the fire here
holding hands.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.399
And I wonder if that...

07:46.399 --> 07:47.900
Oh, yep, it's still here--

07:47.900 --> 07:50.670
that graffiti that you
scratched into the floor.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.938
That's not graffiti, Dad.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.940
That's a Latin pun:
"Semper ubi sub ubi--"

07:53.940 --> 07:56.375
"Always where under where."

07:56.375 --> 07:57.777
(horn honking)

07:57.777 --> 07:59.679
Oh, that'll be
Frasier and Mia.

07:59.679 --> 08:00.680
Yeah. I was
really surprised

08:00.680 --> 08:02.682
he brought her here
for the weekend.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.050
What's she like, anyway?

08:04.050 --> 08:05.418
Uh, well...

08:05.418 --> 08:06.919
she made quite an impression
on me.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.422
I'm curious to see
what you'll think.

08:09.922 --> 08:10.823
Dad.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.291
Would you hand me
that valise?

08:12.291 --> 08:14.293
I want to put on
some bug repellent.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.295
Oh, sure.
Ooh, it's kind of heavy.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.663
What do you got in there?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.465
Bug repellent.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.511
(spraying continues)

08:36.215 --> 08:37.582
Hello, Niles.

08:37.582 --> 08:38.985
Hey, Frasier.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.488
Honey, you stay out there
as long as you like!

08:42.488 --> 08:44.423
She can't take her eyes
off that sunset.

08:44.423 --> 08:45.858
Is everything
all set here?

08:45.858 --> 08:46.859
Yes, I just want to make sure

08:47.360 --> 08:48.861
this VCR works for our
little home movies later. Right.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.863
Check.
Splendid.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.331
Ooh, Niles, you know what,
we're going to need

08:52.331 --> 08:53.266
some more logs
from the woodpile.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.634
Come give me a hand.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.469
Uh, all right.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.771
Oh, Fras! Isn't
it great to be back here?

08:58.771 --> 09:00.273
You know,
I want to thank you guys.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.108
This is some gift.

09:02.108 --> 09:03.476
You're
welcome, Dad.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.944
Listen, if you're
enjoying this little trip

09:04.944 --> 09:06.479
down memory lane, wait
till you see the other

09:06.479 --> 09:07.480
blast from the past
we brought up here.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.315
Shh, shh, shh.
Come on, come on.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.151
Martin?

09:12.151 --> 09:13.052
Hi.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.055
It's Mia.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.924
Oh, my gosh, Frasier did
tell you I was coming,

09:17.924 --> 09:18.758
didn't he?

09:18.758 --> 09:21.661
Oh, yeah, yeah,
of course he did.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.497
Yeah, well,
nice meeting you.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.066
It's very nice
to meet you.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.035
Well, it's
so beautiful here.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.503
Well, I'm glad you like it.

09:30.503 --> 09:31.370
Are you kidding?

09:31.370 --> 09:32.638
I feel like I'm in heaven.

09:32.638 --> 09:36.509
I'm starting to feel
that way myself.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.311
Well, nice going, Niles!

09:38.311 --> 09:39.178
What happened?

09:39.178 --> 09:40.546
Niles dropped a huge log

09:40.546 --> 09:41.881
right onto my hand

09:41.881 --> 09:44.684
when he was startled
by a moth.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.385
(laughs softly)

09:46.385 --> 09:47.320
It was not a moth.

09:47.820 --> 09:48.821
It was a bat.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.823
I could tell from that
eerie, high-pitched scream.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.825
That was you!

09:52.825 --> 09:55.294
You know, frankly, I wish you'd
start seeing someone

09:55.294 --> 09:56.796
about this bug
phobia of yours.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.764
It is not a phobia.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.767
I have a healthy fear
of our natural predators.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.769
It's us versus them,
and frankly,

10:03.769 --> 10:06.606
I'm starting to wonder
just whose side you're on.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.541
It just amazes me that
a good psychiatrist

10:08.541 --> 10:10.042
can be so blind to
something so obvious.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.544
Oh, honey,
your poor thumb.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.545
We should go put
something on that.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.847
Well, okay.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.151
God,

10:19.151 --> 10:21.887
she looks just like your mother.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.556
I know, and Frasier
doesn't see it.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.224
You're kidding.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.492
No, and he has the gall
to tell me I'm blind.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.461
He's clearly the one dealing
with repressed material,

10:28.461 --> 10:30.863
not to mention the obvious
oedipal issues.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.232
Argle gargle, google goo.

10:33.232 --> 10:35.201
What?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.202
Now you know how it feels.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.703
What are you talking about?!

10:37.703 --> 10:39.672
I'm talking about
Freud's theory

10:39.672 --> 10:40.673
of the Oedipus complex.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.209
He believed that every man
subconsciously

10:43.209 --> 10:46.145
wants to sleep with his mother
and kill his father.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.014
It's modeled on the Greek
tragedy of Oedipus,

10:48.014 --> 10:50.516
who actually did sleep with his
mother and kill his father.

10:50.516 --> 10:52.018
And when he realized
what he'd done,

10:52.018 --> 10:53.486
he gouged out both his eyes.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.789
Hmm. Probably not too tough
to pick that guy out of lineup.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.660
Oh, why don't we just send out
engraved invitations

11:00.660 --> 11:03.562
for all the bugs of the forest?

11:03.562 --> 11:05.364
But the question is,

11:05.364 --> 11:07.166
how do we bring it
to Frasier's attention?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.501
We don't.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.770
Dad, denial of this magnitude
is not healthy.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.538
It's for his own good.
No, Niles.

11:12.538 --> 11:13.906
Okay, it's for my own good.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.408
Come on, after the way he wagged
his finger at me,

11:15.408 --> 11:17.376
you can't expect I'm just gonna
be quiet about this.

11:17.376 --> 11:19.845
Look, the last thing I want
on my birthday weekend

11:19.845 --> 11:21.347
is some big, long,
drawn-out argument

11:21.347 --> 11:22.314
between you two, all right?

11:22.314 --> 11:24.383
Now, let's just
chill this beer

11:24.383 --> 11:25.885
that we brought,
all right?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.386
And just put all these
weird thoughts

11:27.386 --> 11:28.854
out of our minds.
Fine.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.322
Oh, sorry, Dad.

11:30.322 --> 11:34.827
Uh, come on, hon, let's go see
if our room still has that...

11:34.827 --> 11:36.328
big, creaky, old pine bed

11:36.829 --> 11:39.365
that Mom and Dad
used to sleep in.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.800
Ah, yeah, there she is!

11:44.103 --> 11:47.239
Well, I guess a warm one
wouldn't kill us.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.479
(liquid pouring)

11:53.479 --> 11:55.047
MARTIN:
Boy, being in this place

11:55.047 --> 11:56.549
really takes me back.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.483
Hey, remember
that summer

11:57.483 --> 11:59.952
I tried to teach you
boys how to fish?

11:59.952 --> 12:01.821
You just didn't
have the knack,

12:01.821 --> 12:03.222
so I went out,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.224
and I bought these two big trout

12:05.224 --> 12:06.992
and snuck them on the boat.

12:06.992 --> 12:09.228
Oh, Marty, you're terrible.
Oh, yeah.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.597
And then I put the
trout on their hooks,

12:11.597 --> 12:13.299
and I dropped them
over the side,

12:13.299 --> 12:17.103
while you two were still arguing
about the last Dramamine.

12:18.337 --> 12:20.506
I felt bad about
fooling you,

12:20.506 --> 12:22.408
but, hell, what's the harm
of a little fantasy

12:22.908 --> 12:23.876
if it makes you feel good?

12:23.876 --> 12:27.079
More wine?
Oh, thanks, hon.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.215
Frasier, you've
hardly touched

12:29.215 --> 12:30.082
your chicken.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.450
Is something wrong?

12:31.450 --> 12:32.852
Oh, no, no.
It's just that...

12:32.852 --> 12:34.854
well, I'm having a little
trouble holding the knife

12:34.854 --> 12:37.256
because someone dropped a log
on my thumb.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.191
Oh, it didn't hurt you
that badly.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.126
You are such a baby.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.560
You are a baby--
running and screaming

12:42.061 --> 12:42.928
because of a little moth.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.730
I told you that was a bat.
It was not a bat!

12:44.730 --> 12:47.233
All right, boys, that's enough!
Not at the table.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.534
Your father's right.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.302
Now, Frasier, if your
hand's hurting you,

12:50.302 --> 12:51.704
I'll cut your meat for you.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.606
Well, all right.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.573
There.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.041
You know, Niles,
not to dwell on this,

12:56.041 --> 12:58.043
but, you know, I could
give you the number

12:58.043 --> 12:59.512
of a man who specializes
in bug phobias.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.380
Oh, is that so? Frankly, while
you're at it,

13:01.380 --> 13:02.248
I think
you should talk to him

13:02.748 --> 13:03.749
about your compulsive
chair-dusting.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.050
I believe that is related.

13:05.050 --> 13:05.851
Frasier.

13:05.851 --> 13:06.852
Well, I'm sorry, Dad.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.854
I think a good psychiatrist
should be self-aware.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.624
Open wide.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.630
So, you're saying
I lack self-awareness?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.598
Why don't we change the subject,
all right?

13:19.598 --> 13:20.599
This is a great meal, Mia.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.101
Thank you.
It certainly was.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.602
Frasier, when it comes
to girlfriends,

13:23.602 --> 13:25.604
you've certainly struck
the mother lode.

13:25.604 --> 13:26.605
Niles!

13:26.605 --> 13:28.874
FRASIER:
You haven't even

13:28.874 --> 13:30.142
read her books yet, Dad.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.644
It's a delightful series

13:31.644 --> 13:34.113
about an adventurous
little panda.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.649
Sounds worthy
of Mother Goose.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.583
Uh, so, uh...

13:37.583 --> 13:39.885
what's coming up next
for you, Mia?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.687
Well, I'll have to swear you
to secrecy. All right.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.689
It looks like that panda

13:43.689 --> 13:46.158
might just find
its way into the attic.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.893
Oh, yes, mum's the word.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.028
Oh, sorry, Niles.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.463
Could you, uh, maybe
come into the kitchen,

13:51.463 --> 13:52.998
and I'll, uh,

13:52.998 --> 13:55.000
I'll just, uh, help
you get dried off.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.269
All right?
Yes, of course.

13:57.269 --> 14:00.472
Oh, dear, it looks like these
pants may have to be re-pressed.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.408
What the hell's
the matter with you?

14:02.408 --> 14:03.409
Oh, I am sorry, Dad.

14:03.409 --> 14:04.376
You can't expect me

14:04.376 --> 14:05.911
to let him sit there
in his booster seat

14:05.911 --> 14:07.413
and tell me I lack
self-awareness.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.381
He's going to pick up
on what you're saying.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.116
You want the whole thing
to blow up?

14:11.116 --> 14:12.718
Dad, this level of
denial is unhealthy.

14:12.718 --> 14:13.586
We're not in denial!

14:13.586 --> 14:14.587
Everything's perfect!

14:14.587 --> 14:16.589
This is the best birthday
I've ever had!

14:16.589 --> 14:18.591
Oh.

14:18.591 --> 14:19.592
Oh, hi.

14:19.592 --> 14:20.593
I'm sorry.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.095
I know it's early,
but, um, I'm exhausted.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.096
Oh, Mia,
well, you go.

14:24.096 --> 14:26.098
You hit the sack.
Thanks for dinner.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.100
Delicious.
We'll wash the dishes.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.101
Thank you.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.102
I'll be along
in a minute.

14:30.102 --> 14:31.103
Um, Frasier...
Yes?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.405
Before you turn in, there's
a little something

14:33.405 --> 14:34.173
we need to deal with.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.541
Oh, geez.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.809
Oh, right, Dad,
your birthday gift.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.277
Oh, yes, my gift!
It's my gift.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.745
I want to open my gift,
all right?

14:39.745 --> 14:42.748
It's my birthday
this weekend, right?

14:42.748 --> 14:45.751
Come on, Niles,
it'll be fun.

14:45.751 --> 14:46.719
Oh, yes, fine.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.720
Oh, come on.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.522
Seeing you and me,
Dad and Mom.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.291
You know,
I'm getting more excited

14:52.291 --> 14:53.259
by the second.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.493
Yeah, come on.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.829
Oh, okay, Dad, now listen.

14:56.829 --> 14:57.830
You sit right here,
all right?

14:57.830 --> 14:58.831
Oh, okay.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.833
What is it,
some kind of movie?

15:00.833 --> 15:01.834
Oh, that's right.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.335
Here we go.

15:03.335 --> 15:05.104
All right.

15:05.104 --> 15:08.807
MARTIN:
Oh, my old home movies.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.209
I haven't seen these
for 20 years.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.744
FRASIER:
Well, happy birthday, Dad.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.212
Now you can watch them
whenever you like.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.580
MARTIN:
Oh!

15:15.814 --> 15:17.516
Isn't it just
the reaction

15:17.516 --> 15:18.918
you were hoping for?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.819
One of them.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.230
Oh, dear God.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.868
Do you two see what I see?

15:35.868 --> 15:37.336
My God, they could be twins.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.771
Frasier,
take it easy.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.239
You do see it.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.740
How could you miss it?

15:41.740 --> 15:43.075
How could I miss it?

15:43.075 --> 15:44.376
Just, uh, you
calm him down,

15:44.376 --> 15:45.811
and I'll go get him
a drink of water. All right.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.379
Oh, my God.
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.

15:47.379 --> 15:48.380
The important thing

15:48.380 --> 15:49.848
is not to blow this
out of proportion.

15:49.848 --> 15:51.283
After all...

15:53.285 --> 15:55.721
What was that,
a hummingbird?

15:55.721 --> 15:57.556
(panting)

15:57.556 --> 15:59.692
What is the matter with me?

15:59.692 --> 16:00.993
Frasier, you didn't
do anything wrong.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.994
Your feelings for Mia

16:01.994 --> 16:03.996
stem from perfectly
natural oedipal desires.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.497
Yes, but oedipal desires

16:05.497 --> 16:08.000
are supposed to resolve
themselves by the age of six.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.835
Oh, for God's sake,
give me that, you idiot.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.503
(screams)

16:13.205 --> 16:15.474
I blinded myself.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.910
I leave you alone with him
for two seconds...

16:17.910 --> 16:18.877
No, no, no, Dad.

16:18.877 --> 16:19.912
Here, Frasier,
are you all right?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.413
Oh, God.
Here, here, wipe your eyes.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.915
(weeping):
I'll be all right.

16:22.915 --> 16:23.916
Just let me, uh...
here...

16:23.916 --> 16:26.819
Just let me try to calm down
a little bit.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.688
She's... she's not my mother.

16:29.688 --> 16:30.723
Frasier.
Hmm?

16:30.723 --> 16:33.225
Time for bed.

16:36.228 --> 16:38.230
(door closes)

16:47.906 --> 16:50.309
Hello.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.147
You wanted to see me?

16:55.147 --> 16:57.616
I hope I wasn't rushing you.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.118
No, no.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.553
It is bedtime.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.454
Are you okay, sweetie?

17:02.454 --> 17:03.956
I mean, you seem a little tense.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.290
No, no, no, no.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.526
I just need to, uh,
calm down a little bit.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.994
Here, just let me, uh--
here, ah, yeah...

17:09.994 --> 17:12.464
See, that's better.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.467
Honey, it seems
like you're in pain.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.803
(gasps)
Oh, it's your hand.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.704
Yes, yes, that's it, yeah.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.708
Well, I know what
the problem is there.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.210
I never kissed your
little boo-boo.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.111
(gasps)

17:26.111 --> 17:27.512
We don't want these
other fingers

17:27.512 --> 17:29.014
to be jealous, do we?

17:29.014 --> 17:30.282
(gasps)

17:30.282 --> 17:31.517
I...

17:31.517 --> 17:32.451
Oh, Frasier, honey.

17:32.451 --> 17:35.387
Please, tell me
what's wrong.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.389
What's bothering you?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.392
I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what's wrong with me.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.895
I'm just having a little trouble
getting comfortable.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.396
Well, was it
something I did?

17:44.396 --> 17:45.864
Something I said
at dinner? What?

17:48.333 --> 17:50.836
Okay, okay.

17:50.836 --> 17:54.306
Gosh, this is awkward.
Uh...

17:56.241 --> 17:57.743
I've just realized

17:57.743 --> 18:02.014
that you bear a striking
resemblance to my mother.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.782
But you just
noticed it now?

18:03.782 --> 18:05.284
Yes.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.285
Well, it can't be

18:06.285 --> 18:08.120
that strong of a
resemblance, then,

18:08.120 --> 18:10.322
can it?

18:10.322 --> 18:11.690
That strong, huh?

18:13.192 --> 18:15.694
Well, listen, I hope
you can get over it,

18:15.694 --> 18:18.697
because I think we have a
pretty great thing going here.

18:18.697 --> 18:19.665
Don't you?

18:19.665 --> 18:22.634
Yes.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.136
We have loads in common.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.537
We get along great.
Mm-hmm.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.439
And don't you want to
stick around long enough

18:27.439 --> 18:31.210
to see how that naughty panda
gets out of the attic?

18:31.210 --> 18:34.379
Oh, I do, yes.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.714
(chuckling):
God, you're right.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.216
You know,
just talking about this

18:37.216 --> 18:38.217
makes me feel much better.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.218
Good.

18:39.218 --> 18:42.020
Oh, gosh,
you're not my mother. No.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.355
This is ridiculous.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.323
Mm-hmm.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.091
So, you're okay?

18:46.091 --> 18:48.327
I'm okay.

18:48.327 --> 18:52.731
(both moan)

18:52.731 --> 18:54.933
I'm better than okay.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.569
Okay, then.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.648
(car horn honks)

19:09.648 --> 19:12.751
Oh, well, there's
your cab.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.021
Take care of yourself.
Yeah.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.990
I'm sorry this is so awkward.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.192
No, really, it's fine.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.460
Okay.
Okay.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.961
Here we go.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.965
Sorry.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.901
(groans)

19:31.236 --> 19:33.005
I take it that
cab was for Mia.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.373
Yeah.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.743
You know, I tried to get
past it, but I just couldn't.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.178
I'm sorry, son.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.646
Yeah, me,
too, Frasier.

19:40.646 --> 19:43.115
Well, I won't be getting
much sleep tonight.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.116
Yeah, I'm up, too.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.618
I won't be getting a
wink of sleep, either,

19:47.119 --> 19:49.388
the way those crickets
are raging.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.190
Niles...

19:51.190 --> 19:54.693
why don't you get us all
a nice, big brandy.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.195
Yeah.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.498
Now, don't make too
much of this, Frasier.

19:59.498 --> 20:02.568
So you picked a woman who looked
like your mother. So what?

20:02.568 --> 20:04.836
Like her would have been fine,
Dad.

20:04.836 --> 20:07.339
I'm not talking
about a similar hairdo

20:07.339 --> 20:08.840
or the same crooked smile.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.742
I was dating a replicant.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.611
Now, Frasier, I know
you're going to go crazy

20:12.611 --> 20:14.112
convincing yourself
that you've got

20:14.112 --> 20:15.614
some big complex,

20:15.614 --> 20:17.115
but couldn't it be
simpler than that?

20:17.115 --> 20:20.552
Maybe you just
miss your mother.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.354
I know I do.

20:22.354 --> 20:25.657
I do think about her a lot.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.593
We all do.
Yeah.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.595
Thanks, Niles.
You're welcome.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.530
Thank you.
Mmm.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.469
Hey, I think we've talked about
all this enough for one night.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.971
So, this is still my birthday,

20:38.971 --> 20:41.473
I want to watch the rest
of my movies. Ooh.

20:41.473 --> 20:42.975
That's a great idea, Dad.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.479
Check.
(chuckles)

20:53.852 --> 20:55.254
NILES:
Well, there certainly

20:55.254 --> 20:56.488
are a lot of
us fighting.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.789
(chuckles)

20:57.789 --> 20:58.790
You know, Dad,

20:58.790 --> 21:00.792
I wish there were
more shots of you in it.

21:01.293 --> 21:03.695
Oh, no, no.
I liked being the cameraman.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.098
I got to focus
on the things I liked.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.368

21:09.368 --> 21:10.969
