WEBVTT

00:09.655 --> 00:13.103
- Yes, honey,
I have got it right here.

00:13.172 --> 00:15.482
No, no, don't worry.
I will.

00:15.551 --> 00:17.172
All right, sweetheart.
Bye.

00:17.241 --> 00:19.206
- Bianca or Nicole?
- Bianca.

00:19.275 --> 00:22.000
Frantic about her book report.

00:22.068 --> 00:23.413
- Oh, yeah,
"A Wrinkle In Time."

00:23.482 --> 00:25.137
I--I mean, we worked
really hard on that.

00:26.862 --> 00:29.034
- She forgot it last night
when Pauline picked her up,

00:29.103 --> 00:31.827
and it is due this afternoon.

00:31.896 --> 00:35.068
Damn it, I have got a breakfast
in Tribeca in a half hour.

00:35.137 --> 00:36.689
- Go.
I can drop it off at school.

00:36.758 --> 00:40.275
You're already late.
I got it.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.551
- I don't deserve you.

00:43.689 --> 00:45.172
Bye.

00:54.172 --> 00:58.758
Oh, come on, climate change.
It was 68 degrees yesterday.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.241
Oh, God, do I not
have a coat here?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.689
This'll do.

01:09.724 --> 01:11.241
This is for Bianca Brooks.

01:11.310 --> 01:12.724
She's in Ms. Wong's
fifth grade class.

01:12.793 --> 01:13.965
If you just point me
in the right direction,

01:14.034 --> 01:15.310
I can drop it off for her.

01:15.379 --> 01:16.620
- We can't actually
let you do that

01:16.689 --> 01:17.862
since you're not
the registered parent.

01:17.931 --> 01:19.620
- Oh.
- Bianca can pick it up

01:19.689 --> 01:22.344
from the office at lunch time.
- Oh, that sounds right.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.724
Thank you so much.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.310
- Um, excuse me?

01:29.310 --> 01:33.448
- Pauline, hi.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

01:33.517 --> 01:35.413
- Is that why you wore my coat?

01:35.482 --> 01:37.068
Oh, my God, I--I--

01:37.137 --> 01:39.000
there was the recent weather
patterns, and I just--

01:39.068 --> 01:41.793
- Relax, Liza, I'm kidding.

01:41.862 --> 01:43.379
- It suits you.

01:43.448 --> 01:45.482
- Isn't this just lovely?

01:45.551 --> 01:48.034
Bianca mentioned
that she had two mommies.

01:48.103 --> 01:51.275
- Yeah, no, Mrs. Klepper,

01:51.344 --> 01:55.103
Liza here is
Charles's girlfriend, not...

01:55.172 --> 01:57.965
- Oh.
- Good-bye, Pauline.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.862
Another successful interaction
for the books, I think.

02:02.655 --> 02:05.482
Look, Liza, wait.
- Oh, my God.

02:05.551 --> 02:08.413
- No, no, no, it's freezing.
Please, keep it.

02:08.482 --> 02:10.758
Consider it an olive branch.

02:10.827 --> 02:12.448
But now that
the divorce negotiations

02:12.517 --> 02:13.965
are more or less behind us,

02:14.034 --> 02:16.620
can't we all behave
like grown-ups?

02:16.689 --> 02:18.448
- Is this a ceasefire?
- Yes.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.965
And my girls love you.

02:21.034 --> 02:22.551
Ooh, you know what?

02:22.620 --> 02:24.827
You should be on the
pick-up list, don't you think?

02:24.896 --> 02:28.206
- Wow, um--yes, I do think.
You do think?

02:28.275 --> 02:29.896
I mean, are you sure?
- Yes.

02:29.965 --> 02:32.310
Mrs. Klepper,
can we register Liza?

02:32.379 --> 02:34.620
She'll be around
for the long haul.

02:34.689 --> 02:37.172
- Of course, Pauline.

02:44.103 --> 02:46.068
- I should have froze
instead of wearing that coat.

02:46.137 --> 02:48.344
I'd have gotten hypothermia,
but maybe I would have died,

02:48.413 --> 02:50.586
and none of this
would have happened.

02:50.655 --> 02:52.965
But it does not do
to dwell on dreams.

02:53.034 --> 02:54.379
- Dumbledore?

02:54.448 --> 02:56.655
The girls are on book three.

02:56.724 --> 02:58.275
- And don't worry
about Pauline.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.724
It seems the worst is over.
- Is it?

03:00.793 --> 03:02.344
Because somehow, I got roped

03:02.413 --> 03:04.206
into having lunch
with her tomorrow.

03:05.482 --> 03:08.655
You're joking.
How, why?

03:08.724 --> 03:11.103
- All good questions.
Moral of the story,

03:11.172 --> 03:12.448
I think I need to start keeping

03:12.517 --> 03:14.000
a spare of everything
at your place.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.586
- Or maybe you should
just move in.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.137
- What?
- No, not maybe.

03:20.206 --> 03:22.206
You should move in.

03:22.275 --> 03:26.034
- Are you asking me to shack up
at the coffee machine?

03:26.103 --> 03:28.137
- Why not?
I just think

03:28.206 --> 03:30.724
if you're going to keep
one coat at my place,

03:30.793 --> 03:32.827
why not keep them all there?

03:32.896 --> 03:37.206
Why not start every morning
waking up together?

03:37.275 --> 03:41.620
- Why not?
- Is that a yes?

03:41.689 --> 03:45.448
- I'll think about it.
- Charles?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.586
Can I have a word?

03:50.172 --> 03:52.000
- Don't overthink.

03:58.344 --> 03:59.689
- I've got big news,

03:59.758 --> 04:01.689
and I wanted
to share it with you first,

04:01.758 --> 04:03.310
since I am your work wife.

04:03.379 --> 04:04.724
Just your work wife, of course,

04:04.793 --> 04:07.551
despite the salacious gossip
in the bull pen.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.137
I'm going to be someone's
real wife.

04:09.206 --> 04:12.413
I'm engaged to Enzo.
- That's wonderful, Diana.

04:12.482 --> 04:14.448
Congratulations.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.344
- Do I have
your blessing, Charles?

04:18.413 --> 04:19.551
- Sure.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.344
It was spontaneous,
so there's no ring yet.

04:27.413 --> 04:28.655
People won't know
unless it's announced.

04:28.724 --> 04:30.137
And of course,
I can't announce it.

04:30.206 --> 04:33.000
That's like lighting
your own birthday candles.

04:35.758 --> 04:38.310
- Would you like me
to announce it, Diana?

04:38.379 --> 04:39.862
- Oh, Charles,

04:39.931 --> 04:41.655
you've always been able
to read me like a book.

04:46.896 --> 04:48.172
- Okay, first order
of business:

04:48.241 --> 04:50.034
The Debutante Ball.
- I'm sorry, what?

04:50.103 --> 04:52.103
I could have sworn you
just said "debutante ball."

04:52.172 --> 04:53.517
- I did, yes.

04:53.586 --> 04:55.655
"Publisher's Weekly"
throws this big party

04:55.724 --> 04:57.241
every year
where first-time authors

04:57.310 --> 05:00.965
are escorted by their mentors
into publishing society.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.517
It's corny, but--

05:02.586 --> 05:03.862
- But it is the event
of the season.

05:03.931 --> 05:05.172
Remember when Maureen Dowd

05:05.241 --> 05:06.586
and Jennifer Egan
wore the same dress?

05:06.655 --> 05:07.896
I swear,
it affected book sales.

05:07.965 --> 05:10.034
- Listen, it's a big press op,

05:10.103 --> 05:11.724
and we're missing
our debutante.

05:11.793 --> 05:14.310
- First time authors.
Why not Jake Devereux?

05:14.379 --> 05:16.551
- Hard pass.
- Quinn doesn't want to do it?

05:16.620 --> 05:18.068
Seems right up her alley.

05:18.137 --> 05:21.241
- She's busy on
the campaign trail, thank God.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.586
- What about the notorious PTB?

05:23.655 --> 05:25.310
- Could you please
use your words?

05:25.379 --> 05:26.896
- Pauline Turner Brooks.

05:26.965 --> 05:28.620
- I know we lost
her upcoming sequel,

05:28.689 --> 05:31.517
but nothing sold better than
"Marriage Vacation" last year.

05:31.586 --> 05:32.896
- Well, I could ask her.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.793
I'm having lunch
with her tomorrow.

05:34.862 --> 05:36.931
- Oh, okay.
That's pretty big news.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.448
- Not that big.
Makes sense.

05:38.517 --> 05:39.620
Former author
and editor reunite.

05:39.689 --> 05:41.000
It seems downright ordinary.

05:41.068 --> 05:42.827
I believe we have
even bigger news today.

05:42.896 --> 05:45.275
Isn't that right, Charles?

05:45.344 --> 05:48.517
- We do?
We do!

05:48.586 --> 05:52.241
Everyone, uh--
Diana is getting married.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.344
- What?
- You are?

05:54.413 --> 05:56.586
To who?
- It's "to whom,"

05:56.655 --> 05:58.172
and his name is Enzo DeLuca.

05:58.241 --> 06:01.586
- Oh, Diana DeLuca.
Well, it's better than Trout.

06:01.655 --> 06:04.172
- I'm keeping Trout.

06:04.241 --> 06:07.655
- Yay!

06:10.103 --> 06:12.379
This is exciting!
I'm so excited!

06:12.448 --> 06:13.689
Why aren't you excited?

06:13.758 --> 06:15.448
- Liza, please
deactivate yourself.

06:15.517 --> 06:16.724
First, planning,
then excitement.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.206
- Okay, well,
I am here to help.

06:18.275 --> 06:19.689
- Good, but I will make
all the arrangements,

06:19.758 --> 06:20.862
and you just
make yourself useful

06:20.931 --> 06:22.068
on the day of.
- The day of?

06:22.137 --> 06:23.931
What's left to do
on the day of?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.724
- Well, helping me get dressed,
running interference,

06:25.793 --> 06:27.310
with my harrowing
new gaggle of in-laws.

06:27.379 --> 06:28.965
That kind of thing.

06:29.034 --> 06:32.275
- You mean, like,
maid of honor stuff?

06:32.344 --> 06:34.275
- If you want to promote
yourself to that, fine.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.793
- Diana, I would love
to be your maid of honor.

06:36.862 --> 06:39.068
- You get one hug a year.

06:40.068 --> 06:41.862
And this is it.
- Ah!

06:44.344 --> 06:47.275
- Okay.
- Okay, yay!

06:59.862 --> 07:03.379
- Are you baking?
- Oh, I made your favorite.

07:03.448 --> 07:07.827
Pecan pie and pinot noir.
Sit.

07:07.896 --> 07:10.000
- Remember in "A Star Is Born"

07:10.068 --> 07:14.241
when Jackson makes that steak
for his dog?

07:14.310 --> 07:15.965
This is giving me
that kind of vibe.

07:16.034 --> 07:17.862
- Charles asked me
to move in with him.

07:17.931 --> 07:20.793
- Oh, wow!
Is that guilt pie?

07:20.862 --> 07:23.068
- And wine.
- Liza, you can unclench.

07:23.137 --> 07:25.206
I'm happy for you.
- I know it's fast,

07:25.275 --> 07:26.655
but it feels right.

07:26.724 --> 07:31.172
- It's a milestone.
I've never lived with anyone.

07:31.241 --> 07:35.482
You're my longest relationship.
Well, you were.

07:35.551 --> 07:37.103
- You and I
are not breaking up.

07:37.172 --> 07:39.034
I'm just going uptown.
- Well, anything that requires

07:39.103 --> 07:41.655
the 6 train is officially
long distance.

07:41.724 --> 07:45.620
- I am going to miss you.
Our wine nights,

07:45.689 --> 07:48.000
binging "The Great British
Bake-Off,"

07:48.068 --> 07:49.793
paint fumes
lulling me to sleep.

07:49.862 --> 07:52.482
- Oh, God, I am going
to send you off

07:52.551 --> 07:55.551
with a cheap thrills to-go kit.
Don't you worry.

07:55.620 --> 07:58.206
- Oh!

07:58.275 --> 08:00.620
You go call Charles
and say yes.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.241
I know you want to.
All right?

08:16.034 --> 08:17.965
- ♪ Black lipstick,
high drama ♪

08:18.034 --> 08:19.241
- How is Kelsey doing--
- So Nicole's getting--

08:19.310 --> 08:20.551
as publisher?
- Really good at violin.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.931
Sorry.
- No--

08:23.000 --> 08:25.241
- Kelsey is killing it.
- Oh!

08:25.310 --> 08:28.344
- It's new terrain, but we're
trekking through it together.

08:28.413 --> 08:30.620
- I always admired
your partnership,

08:30.689 --> 08:34.000
and not only because
it benefitted my book.

08:34.068 --> 08:37.724
- So how is life
as a full-time author?

08:37.793 --> 08:41.000
- Honestly, I've been blocked
on my sequel.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.241
- That surprises me.
I felt like the last time

08:43.310 --> 08:45.758
we saw each other, the words
were just flowing out of you,

08:45.827 --> 08:48.448
like a river or a tsunami.

08:48.517 --> 08:54.275
- Yeah, I was really hurt,
and I was being vindictive.

08:54.344 --> 08:57.551
But the truth is, I should
have stayed at Millennial.

08:57.620 --> 09:01.517
I should have stayed
with you, Liza.

09:01.586 --> 09:03.241
I mean,
you were a dream editor.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.103
You always knew how to get
the best pages out of me.

09:06.172 --> 09:11.655
In fact, maybe now that
we're burying the hatchet...

09:11.724 --> 09:13.206
- You want my help.

09:13.275 --> 09:16.034
- Oh, if you could just read
one or two chapters.

09:16.103 --> 09:21.068
Liza, you understood me
in a way my new editors don't.

09:21.137 --> 09:24.172
I need you.
- Okay.

09:24.241 --> 09:27.689
I'll take a look.
- Oh, thank you!

09:27.758 --> 09:29.620
- But I actually
need a favor in return.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.793
- Okay.
- Millennial is invited

09:31.862 --> 09:34.413
to PW's Debutante Ball tonight.

09:34.482 --> 09:37.586
- Oh, that soiree
for first-time authors.

09:37.655 --> 09:39.379
- I know that
it's totally last minute,

09:39.448 --> 09:42.655
but would you be our deb?

09:42.724 --> 09:45.965
- Are you kidding?
I'd be delighted.

09:46.034 --> 09:48.586
And I dance a mean waltz.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.344
- Do you need
to borrow a dress?

09:56.275 --> 09:58.724
- ♪ I'm extra ♪
- Hey, Liza.

09:58.793 --> 10:00.379
I just wanted
to share some news.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.000
So a friend of mine
from "The New Yorker"

10:02.068 --> 10:04.206
is coming tonight,
so we are going to be

10:04.275 --> 10:06.000
the talk
of the town, literally.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.827
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
Can't wait.

10:08.896 --> 10:10.896
- I think it's wonderful
that you're so friendly

10:10.965 --> 10:12.413
with your ex's girlfriend.

10:12.482 --> 10:14.862
- Oh, well,
what are you going to do?

10:14.931 --> 10:16.793
In my circles,
men are always running off

10:16.862 --> 10:18.275
with their
20-something assistants.

10:18.344 --> 10:21.793
- 20-something?
That woman isn't 20-anything.

10:21.862 --> 10:24.896
- I don't know what you mean.
- Well, I scanned her license

10:24.965 --> 10:26.482
when she registered
as a guardian.

10:26.551 --> 10:29.275
- Sorry, I'm confused.
- Well, I'm not supposed to

10:29.344 --> 10:31.965
share this sort
of information, but...

10:44.448 --> 10:46.172
- Excuse me.

10:50.689 --> 10:52.551
- I think this is
so ridiculous, isn't it?

10:52.620 --> 10:53.758
- Yes, supes redic.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.344
It's like prom
for grown adults.

10:55.413 --> 10:57.965
So obviously, I am here for it.
- Yeah, I wouldn't know.

10:58.034 --> 11:00.517
I skipped my prom to go to
a Danity Kane meet and greet.

11:00.586 --> 11:03.000
- Kelsey.
- I'm not proud.

11:03.068 --> 11:04.965
- Uh, yeah, I lost my virginity
at prom, actually.

11:05.034 --> 11:06.517
Well, most of it.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.241
What about you?
Prom king?

11:09.310 --> 11:11.793
- How'd you know?
- Oh, yeah, that tracks.

11:11.862 --> 11:14.206
- Refill, please.
- Yes, my queen.

11:14.275 --> 11:17.103
- Prom king!
- ♪ There goes my heart ♪

11:17.172 --> 11:18.827
- Cheers.
- Liza Miller?

11:18.896 --> 11:20.379
We're lining up
all the debutantes

11:20.448 --> 11:22.172
and escorts backstage.
Would you please follow me?

11:22.241 --> 11:24.482
- Of course.
Save me a dance.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.000
- Hm.

11:27.965 --> 11:31.034
- Hi.
Can I talk to you?

11:31.103 --> 11:33.241
- Is everything okay?

11:33.310 --> 11:35.586
There's no easy way
to say this,

11:35.655 --> 11:39.379
but Liza is 42.

11:43.379 --> 11:47.103
Did you hear me?
I said that the woman

11:47.172 --> 11:51.103
you're with has been
lying to you and me

11:51.172 --> 11:54.827
and everyone this whole time.

11:56.068 --> 11:58.448
- This isn't how
I wanted you to find out.

12:00.413 --> 12:04.103
- What?
You knew?

12:06.206 --> 12:08.724
Charles...

12:08.793 --> 12:10.448
I trusted her with our girls.

12:10.517 --> 12:13.137
- Mrs. Brooks, there you are.
We need you backstage ASAP.

12:13.206 --> 12:15.896
You're up next.
- I--

12:22.448 --> 12:24.482
- Oh, you look beautiful.
I love the sash.

12:24.551 --> 12:27.103
- Introducing
Pauline Turner Brooks,

12:27.172 --> 12:30.482
author of the best-selling
novel, "Marriage Vacation."

12:32.655 --> 12:36.068
- Arm in arm, please.

12:36.137 --> 12:38.068
- Pauline's escort tonight
is Liza Miller,

12:38.137 --> 12:39.965
editor at Millennial Print.

12:40.034 --> 12:42.344
Pauline and Liza's partnership
is a special one.

12:42.413 --> 12:46.448
She's the only debutante who's
mentor is the younger one.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.000
What an incredible story.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.068
- Um, hello, everyone.

12:55.137 --> 12:58.068
I was so looking forward
to being here tonight

12:58.137 --> 13:01.379
with my editor, Liza Miller,

13:01.448 --> 13:05.827
who I put my absolute faith
and trust in

13:05.896 --> 13:08.310
as I was writing my first book.

13:08.379 --> 13:10.862
Some of you know
I've been working on a sequel,

13:10.931 --> 13:13.620
and I have to admit,
it's been hard

13:13.689 --> 13:16.344
avoiding the sophomore slump.

13:16.413 --> 13:21.448
Just found myself writing
the most clichéd story.

13:21.517 --> 13:24.241
The heroine,
the long-suffering wife,

13:24.310 --> 13:27.172
returns from a writing
sabbatical only to find

13:27.241 --> 13:32.482
that she's lost her husband
to a young assistant.

13:32.551 --> 13:35.344
I don't think it's any secret
that my writing

13:35.413 --> 13:37.655
is somewhat autobiographical.

13:37.724 --> 13:42.068
So imagine how stunned
I was to learn that the truth

13:42.137 --> 13:45.172
is much more dramatic
than anything

13:45.241 --> 13:47.241
I ever could have written.

13:47.310 --> 13:50.482
Because the truth is,
the young assistant...

13:52.103 --> 13:54.793
This assistant...

13:56.517 --> 13:59.724
Is not the 20-something
she claims to be.

13:59.793 --> 14:04.310
Liza Miller is 42 years old...

14:06.517 --> 14:08.862
And she has
been lying shamelessly

14:08.931 --> 14:11.724
about who she is for years.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.586
- God, this woman is deranged.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.482
Forgive me, Charles,
but I cannot just stand by

14:25.551 --> 14:27.068
and let her
slander us like this.

14:27.137 --> 14:29.000
- Diana, don't--
- Pauline, you are the only

14:29.068 --> 14:30.965
shameless liar here.
- Diana, wait--

14:31.034 --> 14:33.379
- You are a sad
and petty person,

14:33.448 --> 14:34.965
simply jealous of the person

14:35.034 --> 14:36.275
that you ex-husband
fell in love with.

14:36.344 --> 14:38.344
How dare you?
How dare you besmirch

14:38.413 --> 14:40.137
this young,
innocent woman's name?

14:40.206 --> 14:41.827
Have you no decency?

14:41.896 --> 14:43.586
We are officially withdrawing
you as our debutante.

14:43.655 --> 14:46.724
Sash, please.
- Diana, it's true.

14:46.793 --> 14:48.551
It's all true.

15:01.689 --> 15:02.896
Diana, wait--
- You stay the hell

15:02.965 --> 15:04.448
away from me.

15:20.206 --> 15:23.103
- Diana!
- Hey, don't push it.

15:27.655 --> 15:30.793
- Oh, my God, Diana!
- Call 911.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.862
- Hey, I got here
as quick as I could.

15:37.931 --> 15:39.275
What's going on?
Is she all right?

15:39.344 --> 15:41.275
- The doctor said
it was a panic attack.

15:42.586 --> 15:45.000
Okay, how's she doing?

15:45.068 --> 15:47.034
- We don't know.
She won't let us see her.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.655
- Hey, are you okay?
What happened?

15:58.724 --> 16:01.137
- Oh, I'm--I'm fine.

16:01.206 --> 16:04.172
I just lost trust
in humanity as a whole.

16:04.241 --> 16:08.275
But other than that, I'm fine.
The Ativan is helping.

16:08.344 --> 16:12.862
Liza has been lying
about her age,

16:12.931 --> 16:16.586
and everyone knew except me.

16:16.655 --> 16:19.655
- Really?
Well, how old is she?

16:19.724 --> 16:22.827
- She's 42.
- Huh.

16:22.896 --> 16:25.275
She looks good.

16:25.344 --> 16:28.965
I--I just mean,
she had me fooled, too.

16:29.034 --> 16:33.862
- Everybody knew, Enzo.
Except me.

16:35.413 --> 16:37.827
I'm the laughingstock.
I'm the village idiot.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.586
I mean, how could I not see it?

16:39.655 --> 16:41.793
It's like that old saying,
you know?

16:41.862 --> 16:44.137
If you smell a fish,
and you look around the room

16:44.206 --> 16:46.448
and you don't see a fish,
you're the fish.

16:46.517 --> 16:51.517
- Look, Liza's outside.
Why don't you talk to her?

16:51.586 --> 16:54.413
- No.
No, I can't.

16:54.482 --> 16:56.241
Just you.

16:58.655 --> 17:02.310
- Fine, I will talk
to your lawyer.

17:05.586 --> 17:08.068
- Lawyer?
What's that all about?

17:10.275 --> 17:11.655
- Pauline's furious.

17:11.724 --> 17:14.068
She wants to revisit
our custody agreement.

17:15.724 --> 17:18.344
Well, now is not the time
for me to move in.

17:18.413 --> 17:22.724
That'll only make things worse.
- Liza, I am so sorry.

17:22.793 --> 17:26.931
- What are you apologizing for?
- She is my responsibility.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.655
Pauline is the mother
of my children.

17:28.724 --> 17:31.206
I should have been honest with
her about it from the start.

17:31.275 --> 17:34.827
- You were just protecting me.

17:40.931 --> 17:45.172
- You guys should head home.
She doesn't want to see anyone.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.103
- Josh.
- Did you--

18:01.172 --> 18:02.620
did you just get back
from Bergdorfs?

18:02.689 --> 18:04.241
Hey, how's the weather
up there?

18:04.310 --> 18:07.103
Is it different?
- What are you talking about?

18:07.172 --> 18:09.206
- Rumor has it that you

18:09.275 --> 18:12.827
are officially
an Upper East Side lady now.

18:12.896 --> 18:18.689
- I'm not.
I'm staying put.

18:18.758 --> 18:21.655
I'm staying exactly
where I am.

18:23.758 --> 18:28.551
- Hey.
Liza, are you okay?

18:28.620 --> 18:31.482
- I made a mess of everything,

18:31.551 --> 18:33.724
and this time,
there's no going back.

18:33.793 --> 18:36.206
I really--I just--
I don't know what to do.

18:38.344 --> 18:41.379
- Well, do you want
to talk about it?

18:41.448 --> 18:47.103
- How much time you got?
- However long you need.

18:52.344 --> 18:53.931
- "The real stories
that Millennial print

18:54.000 --> 18:55.344
"aren't in their
youth-buzzy books,

18:55.413 --> 18:57.344
but behind the scenes."
Nice.

18:57.413 --> 18:59.000
There are so many ways
we could have avoided this.

18:59.068 --> 19:01.206
So many!
- This is a PR nightmare.

19:01.275 --> 19:02.620
- You know,
this explains everything.

19:02.689 --> 19:04.137
I mean,
she doesn't have Snapchat,

19:04.206 --> 19:06.034
she thought Four Loko
was a rapper.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.103
I saw her taking
extra Splenda packets

19:08.172 --> 19:09.793
from the diner and I thought
she was just being quirky.

19:09.862 --> 19:12.034
- Listen, we need to do
major damage control.

19:12.103 --> 19:14.068
- Yes.
- It's like we're cursed.

19:14.137 --> 19:16.034
My scalp's itching me.
- No, Kelsey, no.

19:16.103 --> 19:19.172
- The good news is that Quinn
already knows about Liza's age.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.517
- Oh, the silver lining's
around here

19:21.586 --> 19:23.551
just keep getting thinner.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.172
- Quinn knows.
Oh, what about the interns?

19:26.241 --> 19:28.448
Did they know before me, too?

19:31.758 --> 19:34.034
- He hates me.
- I'll talk to him.

19:34.103 --> 19:36.172
Good morning,
Ms. Miller.

19:36.241 --> 19:37.724
- Lauren.
- My parents raised me

19:37.793 --> 19:39.724
to respect my elders.

19:39.793 --> 19:41.586
- Look, I know I have
a lot of apologizing

19:41.655 --> 19:44.172
to do around here, but there's
somewhere I need to start.

19:44.241 --> 19:45.586
Have either of you seen Diana?

19:45.655 --> 19:47.965
- Oh, yes, Diva's been in
since 6:00 AM.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.000
Ma'am.

19:51.482 --> 19:55.551
Did you get fresh Botox, or...

19:55.620 --> 19:57.793
see you.

20:02.137 --> 20:04.827
- Come in.

20:04.896 --> 20:09.379
Hello, Liza, if that's
even your real name.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.448
- Lauren said
you came in early.

20:11.517 --> 20:14.862
- Yes, I've been drafting
your termination latter.

20:14.931 --> 20:16.862
- Of course.
Diana, if you'll just

20:16.931 --> 20:19.482
let me explain.
- What a charade this has been.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.655
Hm?
First Charles, now this.

20:21.724 --> 20:25.344
I can't seem to keep up with
all the lies that you've told.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.655
You must have had a good time
at my expense.

20:28.724 --> 20:30.310
- No, it wasn't
like that at all.

20:30.379 --> 20:32.551
- What was it like, Liza?

20:32.620 --> 20:35.862
- It was really hard lying to
someone I care about so much.

20:35.931 --> 20:38.068
Diana, I owe so much to you.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.758
You were the only person
who wanted to hire me.

20:39.827 --> 20:41.448
- Well, I wouldn't have
if I'd known.

20:41.517 --> 20:45.931
- Exactly.
That's why I had to lie.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.275
I saw this opportunity
to work for you,

20:48.344 --> 20:50.689
the biggest opportunity
that I have ever had,

20:50.758 --> 20:52.551
and I had to take my shot.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.724
And my life opened up
when I did.

20:55.793 --> 20:58.517
You can't win the game
without playing the game.

21:00.965 --> 21:04.482
You taught me that.
- But for what, Liza?

21:04.551 --> 21:08.103
I mean, I have been searching
my mind for hours,

21:08.172 --> 21:09.620
and for the life of me,
I cannot come up

21:09.689 --> 21:11.620
with one good answer
to the question,

21:11.689 --> 21:14.137
"What self-respecting adult
would go to those lengths

21:14.206 --> 21:17.137
for this job?"

21:17.206 --> 21:19.931
To get me coffee
and chopped salad?

21:20.000 --> 21:23.344
To hand-stitch my pants?
To clean out my bird cage?

21:23.413 --> 21:26.758
To bring my urine sample
to the doctor.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.793
To--to--to hold my hand when I
was alone on the red carpet?

21:29.862 --> 21:32.689
To convince me to fight for
Enzo when I chased him away.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.551
Who would do that?

21:39.034 --> 21:42.068
I mean, it couldn't have been
just for the money.

21:42.137 --> 21:43.931
- Of course not.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.482
I did all those things for you.

21:50.827 --> 21:53.413
- Well, maybe you did
what you had to do.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.413
And I can respect that.

22:00.275 --> 22:03.275
You're lucky you hitched
your wagon to a star.

22:05.793 --> 22:08.448
But if we are going
to forge forward,

22:08.517 --> 22:13.793
honesty is the best policy.
Is that clear?

22:15.137 --> 22:17.793
- I couldn't agree more.
- And one more thing.

22:17.862 --> 22:20.413
You are no longer
my maid of honor.

22:20.482 --> 22:24.586
- I understand.
- You're my old maid of honor.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.689
That's very funny, Diane.
- That's not a joke.

22:32.068 --> 22:35.206
Liza?
- Yes.

22:35.275 --> 22:38.482
- I just want to say...

22:44.103 --> 22:47.448
I--I need the numbers
for the new releases.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.206
I know that I can
find it myself,

22:53.275 --> 22:56.310
but I would
prefer you to do it.

22:56.379 --> 22:59.034
- I love you, too.
