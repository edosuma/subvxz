00:26.727 --> 00:29.063
Nash, you okay?

00:37.438 --> 00:38.639
Come on.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.586
- Not bad.
- Yeah?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.155
You may have a future yet, kid.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.190
- Thanks, Herb.
- Hi, Wheeler.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.692
- Hey.
- I just wanted to say again

01:31.692 --> 01:34.428
how sorry I am about
what happened.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.565
- It's okay.
- Eli has a really
bad temper and stuff.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.700
His mom is making him see
a therapist.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.902
It's okay. No big deal.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.237
Or permanent damage.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.839
Also I wanted to tell you

01:45.839 --> 01:47.208
I got my SAT score back.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.210
Oh, yeah?
How'd you do?

01:49.210 --> 01:52.746
- I got an 1180.
- That's fantastic.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.583
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.851
I'm proud of you.
You worked really hard.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.288
I should go.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.855
You're a really good
teacher, Wheeler.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.032
Hey, Mr. Trips,
when you're done inspiring
future generations,

02:12.032 --> 02:14.235
I could use more olives.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.512
Shalom.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.079
Rabbi.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.283
Glorious day,
isn't it?

02:29.283 --> 02:32.953
I suppose.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.955
Can I help you
with something?

02:34.955 --> 02:37.225
You can indulge me.

02:37.225 --> 02:41.028
I know as a man I am supposed
to keep my distance,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.931
but as a man of God,

02:43.931 --> 02:46.234
when I see someone hurting,

02:46.234 --> 02:49.036
I'm drawn to them
like a moth to a flame,

02:49.036 --> 02:50.871
Hmm.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.241
A wise man once said--

02:57.778 --> 03:03.717
"There is nothing more whole
than a broken heart."

03:03.717 --> 03:05.919
If you say so.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.955
I know so.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.559
Back in rabbinical school,
there were several occasions

03:11.559 --> 03:16.029
where a girl I was crazy about
was stolen away by another guy,

03:16.029 --> 03:19.833
often a sporty fellow
such as yourself.

03:19.833 --> 03:24.171
Of course, at the time,
it was devastating.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.674
But I took comfort
in the fact

03:26.674 --> 03:28.576
that there is nothing
in this life

03:28.576 --> 03:31.379
that isn't willed
by the creator.

03:31.379 --> 03:35.583
And I kept the faith
that someday

03:35.583 --> 03:40.388
He would see fit
that I would be the one

03:40.388 --> 03:42.790
to win the girl.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.861
**

04:03.377 --> 04:05.446
**

04:20.761 --> 04:23.597
Reminds me of the backyard
wedding from "Scarface," right?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.333
Fewer tigers.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.169
Can't believe old Barry's
actually getting hitched.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.639
Used to be quite the cocksman
back in the day.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.107
I could tell you some stories.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.345
- Please don't.
- Your loss.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.084
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey. You guys come together?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.119
- Yeah.
- No.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.357
What your father means is
we were invited separately,

04:49.357 --> 04:51.459
but since neither of us
were bringing dates,

04:51.459 --> 04:53.794
we figured we'd carpool
to save gas.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.797
- It was your mother's idea.
- Okay.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.632
I gotta sit.
My sciatica's bothering me.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.434
Okay.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.370
Bye.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.972
- Check you out.
- Yeah, he cleans up good,
don't he?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.641
- I look like
a mattress salesman.
- You do not. Tell him.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.909
I wouldn't buy a mattress
from you.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.378
Even if my prices
were insane?

05:10.378 --> 05:12.880
Mmm.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.482
Nash. Hey, dude.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.150
- Boychick, boychick, my dear.
- Hey.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.687
Hey, you know, a couple
of Karen's hot friends
from nursing school are here.

05:19.687 --> 05:20.988
That should prove fortuitous

05:20.988 --> 05:22.756
if anyone chokes
on a Jordan almond

05:22.756 --> 05:25.626
and requires the Heimlich.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.096
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go find
a "me-maw" to sit beside.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.400
He's really taking
this breakup hard, huh?

05:32.400 --> 05:34.067
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.703
It doesn't help that
everywhere he goes in the club

05:35.703 --> 05:37.070
he bumps into Mrs. Horowitz
and her rabbi.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.739
We gotta cheer him up, man.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.808
You get a chance
to talk to Ganz yet?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.876
I paged him,
but he hasn't called me back.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.044
Think he's in jail?

05:44.044 --> 05:46.046
Hopefully not at the bottom
of the Hudson.

05:48.115 --> 05:51.852
- Ganz, is he the--
- Hey, there's two seats.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.456
- Let's go grab them.
- Okay. Bye.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.425
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.894
So when are we gonna talk
about what happened
the other night?

06:00.894 --> 06:03.263
Never.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.232
I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings,

06:05.232 --> 06:06.967
or if I sent
the wrong signals--

06:06.967 --> 06:08.702
Just drop it, okay?
It never happened.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.704
I just didn't know you still
had those kinds of feelings.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.173
I don't want to talk
about it, Judy.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.444
- Well, I do, because
I think it's important--
- Oh, God damn it.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.011
- This was a mistake.
- Sam.

06:18.011 --> 06:21.348
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Sam, wait.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.051
- Pardon me. Excuse me.
- Wait. Where are you going?

06:24.051 --> 06:25.052
Thank you.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.353
Seriously, Sam?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.822
Really?

06:28.822 --> 06:31.158
Oh, great.
That's just great.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.061
- How's it going, Tito?
- Yeah, not bad.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.329
- I'm getting some good stuff.
- Sweet.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.731
How about you?
Everything cool?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.833
As an above ground pool.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.938
- You sure?
- No.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.474
What's wrong?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.910
Karen's freaking out.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.745
She's in the bathroom
upstairs.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.948
Says she feels like
she might puke or pass out.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.750
Hopefully not both
at the same time.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.151
That's how Hendrix died.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.289
I don't know
if she's coming out.

07:02.289 --> 07:06.494
Oh, shit.
What are you gonna do?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.729
I was hoping maybe
you go talk to her.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.031
- Me?
- You know her
better than anyone.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.735
- She'll listen to you.
- Why not you?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.704
Bad luck if I see her
before the ceremony.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.572
That's just
an old wives' tale.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.508
Yeah,
my bro thought that.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.676
His kid came out
looking like Dr. Zaius.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.680
I'm sorry. I can't.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.617
Because you don't think
she should marry me?

07:29.617 --> 07:32.920
No, because I think it's
a decision she needs
to make for herself.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.626
Please.
I love her.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.967
- Go away, Mom.
- It's not your mom.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.839
Can I come in?

08:00.581 --> 08:03.551
You okay?

08:03.551 --> 08:04.718
I don't know.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.587
You need a doctor
or something?

08:06.587 --> 08:08.822
A therapist maybe.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.959
This must seem
pretty funny to you

08:11.959 --> 08:14.294
since I was always the one
in such a hurry to grow up.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.096
No, I don't think it's funny.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.633
- Did Barry send you?
- He asked me to.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.101
I said no.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.770
I wasn't gonna talk you
into marrying him.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.573
- Why are you here?
- Because I figured

08:25.573 --> 08:27.007
you'd probably feel
pretty alone right now,

08:27.007 --> 08:30.310
and I wanted you to know
you're not.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.780
And also to tell you,
if you don't wanna go
through with this,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.815
you don't have to.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.784
Just say the word,
and I'll get you out of here.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.452
You'd do that for me?

08:39.452 --> 08:41.121
Yeah, of course.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.128
So you want me
to pull the car around?

08:50.197 --> 08:53.601
I don't know
what I want anymore.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.069
Maybe this will help.

09:01.141 --> 09:05.412
Hey, babe. It's me, Barry.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.381
I know you're feeling
pretty overwhelmed right now,

09:08.381 --> 09:09.917
and I don't blame you.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.753
I'm feeling pretty
overwhelmed myself.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.691
I never thought
I'd settle down.

09:17.691 --> 09:21.128
Figured some horses just
weren't meant to be broke--

09:22.062 --> 09:24.531
...that I'd roam these lands

09:24.531 --> 09:26.800
wild, lonely, and free.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.903
Then one day you galloped
into my life,

09:29.903 --> 09:32.773
a sexy Palomino,

09:32.773 --> 09:34.742
wind blowing through
your mane.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.445
And even though there was
another guy riding you
at the time,

09:38.445 --> 09:44.517
I knew one day
you'd be the one to tame me.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.054
And you did, Karen.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.289
You're back to being
a woman now in this metaphor,

09:49.289 --> 09:52.092
because Karen's not really
a good name for a horse.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.663
Usually they're called things
like Peanut or Apache.

09:55.663 --> 09:58.298
Anyway.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.834
The point is...

10:00.834 --> 10:03.003
I love you,

10:03.003 --> 10:04.638
and I'm done roaming.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.977
You done broke
this wild mustang.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.649
Got me eating out
of your hand.

10:15.649 --> 10:19.753
And I'm not interested
in anyone's sugar lumps
but yours.

10:19.753 --> 10:23.657
So...

10:23.657 --> 10:28.061
will you make me
the happiest horse on earth,

10:28.061 --> 10:30.297
and ride off
into the sunset with me?

10:41.508 --> 10:42.810
Yes.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.214
Tell him I said yes.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.269
**

11:14.474 --> 11:17.344
* Time *

11:17.344 --> 11:22.950
* I've been passing time
watching trains go by *

11:24.752 --> 11:27.788
* All of my life *

11:27.788 --> 11:34.327
* Lying on the sand
watching seabirds fly *

11:36.496 --> 11:40.233
* Wishing there would be *

11:40.233 --> 11:44.271
* Someone waiting home
for me *

11:46.539 --> 11:52.312
* Something's telling me
it might be you *

11:52.312 --> 11:56.616
* It's telling me
it might be you *

11:56.616 --> 11:59.252
* All of my life *

12:00.553 --> 12:02.322
**

12:08.161 --> 12:10.297
* You never asked me to stay *

12:10.297 --> 12:12.665
* Until the morning *

12:12.665 --> 12:14.334
- I'm impressed.
- Huh?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.837
Your work ethic.
By now, most videographers

12:16.837 --> 12:19.706
would be shitfaced and hitting
on bridesmaids.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.574
That was my M.O.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.611
- You've been a videographer?
- I've been everything, kid...

12:24.611 --> 12:27.047
including married.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.017
- Hey, you want a job?
- Sure.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.153
I'm not kidding.
Could use someone
like you down at ZBX.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.156
Not afraid to work.
You know your way around
an editing deck,

12:36.156 --> 12:37.825
don't have an aversion
to bathing.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.426
Really?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.361
- Yeah.
- Wow.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.663
Uh, can I have some time
to think about it?

12:43.663 --> 12:46.033
Yes, think it over.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.101
All right, I gotta find
a way to eat this.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.843
- Hey!
- Oh, gosh!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.878
- Hey. Hey.
- Hi.

12:59.412 --> 13:00.914
Hey.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.484
Hey, um, you look great.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.920
Thank you.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.089
You sounded real good
out here.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.424
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.326
Who knew you had
such a sensitive side?

13:13.326 --> 13:16.063
Yeah, well,
after we broke up,

13:16.063 --> 13:17.965
I did a lot
of soul searching.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.100
I got in touch
with the real Steve,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.736
the guy that just wants
to love and, you know,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.472
- be loved.
- Hmm.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.407
I've changed.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.414
All right,
that was a nice talk.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.949
- Excuse me.
- So if you really--

13:43.356 --> 13:45.625
Beautiful ceremony,
wasn't it?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.894
Mm-hmm.

13:49.196 --> 13:52.365
- They looked so happy.
- Yup.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.904
Sam, we're adults.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.907
We should be able to talk
about what happened the
other night.

13:59.907 --> 14:00.908
I don't wanna.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.575
Karen! Sweetheart!

14:02.575 --> 14:04.912
- Hi!
- Hey.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.547
- So beautiful.
- Thank you.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.216
Thank you, Mrs. Myers.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.352
Actually, I've decided
to go back to my maiden name--

14:12.352 --> 14:16.023
- Rosen.
- Since when?

14:16.023 --> 14:20.360
Um, it just became official
a few days ago.

14:24.464 --> 14:28.268
Excuse me, I'm gonna
go get something to drink.

14:30.403 --> 14:34.441
So, where are you kids
going on your honeymoon?

14:34.441 --> 14:37.010
- Acapulco.
- Mexico, huh?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.779
Great, great.
Don't drink the water.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.448
Yeah, it's what I hear.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.951
Or eat the food.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.587
How's my Gracie doing?

14:47.587 --> 14:49.722
She's great.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.124
Great.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.326
Don't even know she's there.

14:53.326 --> 14:57.497
So that's my story,
cuckolded by a man
of the cloth.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.100
That's what they'll carve
on my gravestone,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.834
except I plan to be cremated

15:01.834 --> 15:05.205
and have my ashes scattered
across a women's softball team.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.116
Nasser.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.485
Skip.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.589
Can I help you
with something?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.392
Just doing some recon on those
two girls standing over there

15:25.392 --> 15:27.995
- by that huppah.
- It's not a huppah.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.329
It's a trellis.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.331
- Same difference.
- No, it isn't.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.367
A huppah is a sacred symbol
of Jewish matrimony.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.004
A trellis is
a garden decoration.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.006
Whatever.

15:39.006 --> 15:42.809
Point is, seems like
a wasted opportunity.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.212
Both of us are flying solo.

15:45.212 --> 15:49.016
Thought maybe we could team up.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.019
You're asking me
to be your wingman?

15:58.291 --> 16:01.028
No, I'm afraid
my flying days are over.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.365
I'll do it.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.036
No.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.038
**

16:23.083 --> 16:27.420
* I just close my eyes *

16:27.420 --> 16:29.589
* And you'll appear *

16:29.589 --> 16:32.925
* Just like you always *

16:32.925 --> 16:37.330
* Did before *

16:37.330 --> 16:41.068
* And when I call
your name... *

16:43.703 --> 16:45.205
You wanna dance?

16:48.108 --> 16:50.777
- Aren't you working?
- I'm on a break.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.751
Everything okay
with you and Dad?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.453
Oh, fine.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.656
Why did he change seats
before the ceremony?

17:03.656 --> 17:08.595
I think your father's having
a hard time moving on.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.897
I thought it was both
your ideas to get divorced.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.132
I did, too.

17:15.735 --> 17:19.106
So your dad tells me
that you and Skye broke up.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.874
Yeah. Well, not officially.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.311
We had a pretty big fight,
and we haven't talked since.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.180
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.982
- Want my advice?
- No.

17:29.982 --> 17:33.153
- Okay.
- No offense, Mom.
I appreciate it.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.789
But I just think it's something
I need to figure out on my own.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.129
So why didn't you bring
a date today?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.264
Well, I'm not seeing anyone
right now.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.133
But you were?

17:46.133 --> 17:49.402
Um, well,
the person I was seeing

17:49.402 --> 17:51.971
wanted to go faster
than I did,

17:51.971 --> 17:55.142
and I just wasn't ready

17:55.142 --> 17:57.009
for a real relationship.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.146
Why not?

17:59.146 --> 18:02.982
You know, I was Mrs. Sam Myers
for so long.

18:02.982 --> 18:06.219
It's nice to just be Judy
for once.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.988
Oh, and not have to worry
about anybody

18:08.988 --> 18:11.624
but me and you, of course.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.661
You don't need to worry
about me, Mom.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.664
Don't I?

18:43.456 --> 18:47.260
That's good cake!
That's good cake!

18:48.195 --> 18:50.029
What's wrong?

18:50.029 --> 18:51.198
Nothing.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.768
Aren't you having
a good time?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.103
Totally.

18:57.103 --> 19:01.841
Um, I just...

19:01.841 --> 19:02.742
Fuck.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.911
What?

19:04.911 --> 19:08.881
What would you say if I were
to go back to school?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.617
Finish my degree.

19:10.617 --> 19:13.320
Maybe get my teaching
certificate.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.223
Are you serious?

19:19.526 --> 19:22.429
I would say that's awesome.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.431
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

19:24.431 --> 19:26.233
I think you would make
an amazing teacher.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.768
- You think?
- Yeah, absolutely.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.338
This will be so much fun.
We can study together.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.341
We can make out in the stacks
at the library.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.944
Actually, I was thinking of

19:37.944 --> 19:39.946
maybe going back to Cornell.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.251
Oh.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.259
- Travalanche.
- Barracuda.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.294
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.963
- So glad you can make it.
- Open bar.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.598
Hey, hey.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.900
Got a box of videos
I want to bequeath to you

20:00.900 --> 20:02.435
upon my return from Mexico.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.903
What videos?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.572
"Emmanuel,"

20:05.572 --> 20:07.907
Joys Of A Woman,"

20:07.907 --> 20:09.242
"Black Emmanuel."

20:09.242 --> 20:10.777
My whole collection.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.911
The whole tugboat.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.314
You can't be serious.
Are you sure?

20:14.314 --> 20:16.349
Not gonna be needing them
anymore.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.385
I want them to find
a good home.

21:05.332 --> 21:09.235
Well, all in all, I suppose
it wasn't such a bad afternoon.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.638
You crashing
at my place tonight?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.340
I think Mom's.
It's closer to the club,

21:13.340 --> 21:14.807
and I need to teach Getty
first thing in the morning.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.444
Oh, yeah? How's things
with you and Getty?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.245
He actually offered me
a job at his firm.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.348
Oh, honey.

21:21.348 --> 21:24.584
Honey, that's fantastic.
When do you start?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.252
Well, I haven't decided
to take it yet.

21:26.252 --> 21:28.187
What do you mean,
you haven't decided?

21:28.187 --> 21:30.089
I don't wanna rush
into anything.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.124
It's a big decision.
I wanna take my time,
weigh my options.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.362
- What options?
- Other offers.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.929
You've had other offers?

21:36.929 --> 21:39.599
Travis at Channel 87 wants
to hire me full time.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.201
To do what,
host a psychic hotline?

21:42.201 --> 21:45.672
We didn't discuss job titles,
but, you know, some kind of
production assistant.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.507
- Did you discuss a paycheck?
- No.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.477
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.
Honey, please.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.078
Listen to your old man.

21:52.078 --> 21:55.748
Opportunities like Getty's
don't come along often.

21:55.748 --> 21:59.452
This could set you up
for a very comfortable life.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.953
What are you two
talking about?

22:00.953 --> 22:03.189
We're discussing
our son's future.

22:03.189 --> 22:07.159
Oh, good! Because I've been
giving it a lot of thought.

22:07.159 --> 22:11.230
As someone who never got
to go to a four-year college
and regrets it,

22:11.230 --> 22:14.801
I feel very strongly that you
should go back to NYU this fall

22:14.801 --> 22:18.070
- and finish your degree.
- In what?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.239
English, basket weaving--
It doesn't matter.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.208
Just go get your diploma.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.810
I'd rather he get a job.

22:23.810 --> 22:25.678
Can we talk about all this
some other time?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.013
When would you like
to talk about it,

22:27.013 --> 22:28.448
when you're 40 and still
crashing on my couch?

22:28.448 --> 22:30.650
Sam! Don't be mean!

22:30.650 --> 22:33.019
I'm not being mean.
I'm being a father

22:33.019 --> 22:35.187
who is giving his son
the kick in the ass he needs.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.724
- I don't need
a kick in the ass.
- Oh, yeah? What do you need?

22:37.724 --> 22:39.058
For you to get off
my fucking back!

22:39.058 --> 22:41.060
Hey, don't speak
to your father that way.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.799
Come on, Judy.
I'm leaving.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.035
Are you still staying
at my place tonight?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.770
Yeah. I'm gonna be
kind of late, though.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.071
There's something
I need to do.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.608
- Okay.
- Come on, Judy.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.085
Gracie! Oh, honey!

23:39.085 --> 23:42.388
Oh, you had me so worried!
Where was she?

23:42.388 --> 23:43.490
Found her poking around
the dumpsters

23:43.490 --> 23:44.591
behind the mini-mart
where I work.

23:44.591 --> 23:47.026
You crossed the street
by yourself?

23:47.026 --> 23:51.030
What were you thinking?
You could have been hit
by a Mack truck.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.331
Oh, thank you.

23:52.331 --> 23:55.502
Thank you so much,
Miss, um...

23:55.502 --> 23:56.636
Agatha.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.572
Agatha! Of course, yes!

23:59.572 --> 24:03.175
From the-- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's been a long day.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.344
Why are you wearing a tie?

24:05.344 --> 24:08.915
- Wedding.
- Oh.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.918
- I like weddings.
- Me, too.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.854
Listen, would you care
for some wedding cake?

24:14.854 --> 24:17.423
'Cause I got a piece.
It's way too big for one person.

24:17.423 --> 24:21.027
In fact, if my cardiologist
knew I was eating it
all by myself,

24:21.027 --> 24:22.762
he'd have a coronary.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.664
You have a heart condition?

24:29.602 --> 24:32.539
I have asthma.

24:54.060 --> 24:54.994
Hey.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.331
What are you doing here?

24:59.331 --> 25:03.035
I tried calling you
the other day,
but you weren't home.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.071
Why didn't you leave
a message?

25:05.071 --> 25:08.074
I don't know. I guess
I figured it was better
we talk in person.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.576
Yeah.

25:11.477 --> 25:14.581
Machines are pretty
impersonal.

25:26.593 --> 25:29.161
I guess there's
not much to say.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.930
Maybe not.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.836
Look, I don't--

25:38.938 --> 25:42.742
I don't think either of us
has anything to apologize for.

25:42.742 --> 25:46.212
We're just different people.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.148
We have very different
points of view,

25:49.148 --> 25:52.118
- or at least you do.
- What?

25:52.118 --> 25:55.521
Uh, just have a point
of view.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.790
Apparently,
I'm lacking in one,

25:57.790 --> 26:00.292
according to Zan's
art teacher friend.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.829
- She said that?
- Yeah.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.164
Well, she's wrong,
so fuck her.

26:09.501 --> 26:13.005
I brought you this.
It's the footage
I shot in Paris.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.774
I got it transferred
to video.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.310
Wow.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.116
That feels like
a lifetime ago.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.117
I know.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.556
- I still can't believe
my parents showed up.
- Yeah, I know,

26:30.556 --> 26:31.791
Can you imagine
what would have happened

26:31.791 --> 26:33.392
if they knew I was
under the sofa naked?

26:33.392 --> 26:35.361
Oh, God, no.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.099
I know you're pretty busy,

26:40.099 --> 26:42.101
so you probably won't get
a chance to watch it.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.435
No. No, I will.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.536
I want to.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.105
I-- I wanna--
I want to.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.751
I should really
get back to work.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.821
Okay.

27:07.559 --> 27:11.430
Oh, by the way, your dad's
verdict is due any day now.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.732
Probably Thursday or Friday.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.500
I can't be there.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.402
So it won't be awkward
for you to go.

27:19.171 --> 27:22.341
I'll see if I can.
I have a lot going on.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.776
You should be there.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.415
**

27:35.822 --> 27:37.890
* But when it dies *

27:37.890 --> 27:39.859
* It dies for good *

27:39.859 --> 27:41.293
* It's for love *

27:43.562 --> 27:48.801
* And it belongs
to everyone but us *

27:57.609 --> 28:02.081
* I've lived my life
in the valleys *

28:02.081 --> 28:06.285
* I've lived my life
on the hills *

28:06.285 --> 28:10.556
* I've lived my life
on alcohol *

28:10.556 --> 28:13.926
* I've lived my life
on pills *

28:13.926 --> 28:15.795
* But it's called love *

28:17.764 --> 28:22.034
* And it belongs to us *

28:22.034 --> 28:23.836
* It's called love *

28:26.238 --> 28:30.877
* And it's the only thing
that's worth living for *

28:30.877 --> 28:32.779
* It's called love *

28:34.881 --> 28:39.085
* And it belongs to us *

28:39.085 --> 28:40.920
* It's called love *

28:43.689 --> 28:47.794
* Yes, it's called love *
