00:01.369 --> 00:04.105
Previously on Numbers:

00:04.138 --> 00:06.207
MAN:
Practical applications.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.775
Professor Phillip Sanjrani?

00:07.808 --> 00:08.742
- Yes?
- Special Agent William Fraley.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.578
I'm gonna have to ask you
to come with me.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.413
You work with the FBI.
What's happening?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.414
I don't know.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.448
I-I'll find out.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.384
The guy e-mailed instructions
for a bioweapon

00:16.417 --> 00:17.418
to Pakistan.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.588
They got some FBI scientist
to review my work

00:20.621 --> 00:23.457
and say it's applicable
to human pathogens.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.593
I'll find that report,
and I'll review it.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.560
His work is

00:26.594 --> 00:28.062
in crop development.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.530
It's designed to
create new strains

00:29.563 --> 00:31.565
of food crops resistant
to drought and insects.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.567
Why is Phil Sanjrani
still in custody?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.336
We now know that there
was no terrorist action.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.737
Doesn't matter.
He did what he did.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.273
Yeah, it matters.
It matters.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.543
CHARLIE: I e-mailed
the rest of Sanjrani's work

00:42.576 --> 00:45.146
to scientists at four
universities in Pakistan.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.314
You lost your
security clearance?

00:46.347 --> 00:47.281
Yeah.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.382
This is my attorney,

00:48.416 --> 00:50.418
and he's negotiated my surrender

00:50.451 --> 00:51.785
to Federal authorities.

00:51.819 --> 00:55.356
AGENT: Mr. Eppes, I'll
need to handcuff you.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.226
*

01:04.498 --> 01:05.399
* It has begun

01:07.301 --> 01:10.238
* This is the reason
why I live *

01:10.271 --> 01:14.408
* I give back
everything that I take *

01:14.442 --> 01:17.511
* I won't leave
until I grow, I grow *

01:17.545 --> 01:21.582
* It's second nature,
and I know, I know *

01:21.615 --> 01:24.418
* This is the reason
why I live *

01:24.452 --> 01:27.688
* I give back
everything that I take *

01:27.721 --> 01:31.192
* I won't leave
until I grow, I grow *

01:31.225 --> 01:34.628
* It's second nature,
and I know, I know *

01:40.501 --> 01:41.502
Uh, Andy,

01:41.535 --> 01:44.905
I got still got
all kinds of slack down here.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.740
(rope snaps)

01:46.774 --> 01:48.376
Hey!

01:48.409 --> 01:50.378
You pulled me off!

01:50.411 --> 01:52.480
Andy?

01:54.415 --> 01:56.517
Andy's indisposed at the moment.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.585
You have something

01:57.618 --> 01:58.752
that belongs to me.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.120
Send up the pack.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.592
We didn't know.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.494
No. You didn't.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.929
So, we're cool, right?

02:08.962 --> 02:11.532
Yeah.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.667
We're cool.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.905
(screaming)

02:28.616 --> 02:30.518
Call you later.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.785
What are you doing here?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.287
I didn't tell anybody
when the hearing was.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.322
Hey.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.689
I'm a Federal prosecutor,
I know these things.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.690
Oh, yeah?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.226
- You off the hook?
- Yeah.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.560
The judge accepted
the government's motion

02:39.593 --> 02:40.661
and dropped all charges.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.496
You are so lucky, Charlie.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.199
- So is your friend Sanjrani.
- You call three weeks

02:45.233 --> 02:46.534
in Federal detention lucky?

02:46.567 --> 02:49.237
Well, he could've wound up
in jail or deported.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.438
Only if the FBI was intent

02:50.471 --> 02:51.639
on seeing something
that wasn't there.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.341
What about your
security clearance?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.608
It didn't get
straightened out.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.644
Even though you technically
did nothing wrong?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.779
Hey, that's not the way
the Bureau sees it.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.287
Mm. Good-bye
to covert satellites.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.456
Well, there's plenty
of other cool

03:08.489 --> 03:09.490
stuff here to work on.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.958
Well, maybe you should think

03:10.991 --> 03:13.427
about maybe getting
your clearance back.

03:13.461 --> 03:16.630
That means a whole new
security investigation, right?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.799
Except this time, they'll be
looking for a reason to say no.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.668
They'll grill me.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.270
They'll grill everybody I know.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.304
They'll be

03:23.337 --> 03:24.938
intrusive
and embarrassing.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.674
Well, it sounds like payback.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.441
Oh, that's exactly what it is.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.244
Meanwhile,
for every case I worked,

03:30.278 --> 03:32.446
there's lots of stuff here
that went neglected.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.548
So much math, so little time.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.384
Exactly.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.853
(garbled radio transmission)

03:41.622 --> 03:43.557
MAN: Throw up the rope
and put him in the bigger bag.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.459
MAN 2 (over radio): We're at the
bottom of the hill

03:45.493 --> 03:46.694
making our way up.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.728
Yeah, right there,
put a marker.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.830
Andrew Tomkins, 22.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.599
Brian Wright, 24.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.000
Don't know much
about them

03:53.033 --> 03:53.867
just yet.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.604
So, Tomkins was shot
at close range.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.639
Wright either fell
or was dropped.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.608
Somebody tore through
their stuff pretty good.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.410
Definitely looking
for something.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.711
We'll need somebody
that knows the mountains.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.879
Boo.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.582
Yeah, maybe we can see
if Ian Edgerton's around.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.518
Hey, man. Don.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.619
COLBY:
What are you doing here?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.687
I caught up with an escaped
convict in Riverside.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.523
Tonight I fly out of LAX
to Oslo.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.557
Fugitive stockbroker.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.558
So you came down here

04:17.591 --> 04:19.460
to taunt us with your
lack of availability?

04:19.493 --> 04:20.661
Hey.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.862
- What do you say, Ian?
- Agent Eppes.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.565
I asked Ian to come give us
a little bit of his wisdom.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.566
I don't know

04:25.599 --> 04:26.467
if you guys need a tracker.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.835
DAVID: Lot of innocent
people up here.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.738
We got kids, families,
hiker, puppies.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.039
(garbled radio transmission)

04:32.072 --> 04:33.541
So why's the FBI involved?

04:33.574 --> 04:34.908
Simple double-homicide.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.710
Check this out.

04:36.744 --> 04:37.878
It's been processed.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.381
It was in the bag
they use with chalk.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.383
COLBY: Found it attached
to his harness.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.584
An uncut diamond?

04:43.617 --> 04:44.785
DON:
Yeah, 72 carats.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.919
It's worth about half a mil.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.722
Not so simple after all.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.595
(screaming)

05:03.771 --> 05:06.440
Hey, guys, how are we doing
on those two dead climbers?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.475
No records.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.642
Wright was unemployed.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.344
Tomkins had
a part-time job.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
Neither of these guys
have a residence.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.081
They stayed with friends,
lived out of their cars.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.616
Spent all their time
rock-climbing.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.551
The diamond-- it's still
a mystery. I mean,

05:17.585 --> 05:18.919
you're gonna tell me
this guy

05:18.952 --> 05:20.921
looks like a sophisticated
jewel thief?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.055
Yeah, I hear you.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.757
But still, I mean, somebody
wanted them dead, right?

05:23.791 --> 05:27.094
What about the diamond itself?

05:27.127 --> 05:28.796
I'm running the rock
through the Jewelers' Security

05:28.829 --> 05:30.431
Alliance database.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.002
And who the
hell are you?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.538
Special Agent Nikki Betancourt.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.639
Nikki's new around here.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.042
If you can qualify as "new"
after four years LAPD.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.845
Where I come from,
we spend, uh,

05:44.878 --> 05:47.548
more time working informants
than databases.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.849
Well, it takes more
than street cop attitude

05:48.882 --> 05:50.584
to get an invitation
to Quantico.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.485
I got a law degree.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.820
Oh.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.488
Another overachiever.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.023
NIKKI:
Nothing so far

05:56.056 --> 05:56.957
on the diamond.
Don't even

05:56.990 --> 05:58.492
know yet if it's stolen.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.259
Well, I mean,
the guy didn't mine it.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.193
There's a science
to diamonds,

06:00.227 --> 06:01.795
the way they authenticate
them and all.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.431
Yeah, so let's get
Mr. Math in on this.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.598
Uh,

06:04.632 --> 06:05.499
Charlie has

06:05.533 --> 06:07.401
a problem with his
security clearance.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.569
So?

06:08.602 --> 06:09.703
Charlie's not working

06:09.737 --> 06:11.739
with us anymore, okay?
Can we just leave it at that?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.907
Oh.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.609
Okay, then.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.744
Uh, what about that other guy?

06:16.777 --> 06:17.745
Flintstone, Fierstein?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.046
Fleinhardt?

06:19.079 --> 06:19.980
Yeah, he's worked

06:20.013 --> 06:21.014
on a few cases with us.

06:21.048 --> 06:21.982
Amita, too.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.488
MAN: Brian and Andy, man,
they were full on,

06:27.521 --> 06:28.789
always climbing.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.623
They have any enemies?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.559
No, they never got
in any trouble.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.026
Brian was too goofy and friendly
to get anybody mad at him.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.862
And how about Andy?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.630
Andy was a little more serious
than Brian, but not much.

06:36.664 --> 06:37.831
Who knew them best?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.667
That would be Pete and Skeet.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.968
Pete Fuller, Theresa Kulhman,

06:41.001 --> 06:42.570
the climbers who found
the bodies.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.672
Skeet's real name is Theresa?
Seriously?

06:44.705 --> 06:48.609
So were they just climbing
partners or anything more?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.478
I don't think Pete's even
noticed Skeet's a girl.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.012
We're gonna have to talk
to them again.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.714
Oh, well check out Stony Point.
That's where they go bouldering.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.182
What's bouldering?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.416
Climbing on
smaller rocks

06:56.450 --> 06:58.686
without ropes. My cousin back
home in Boise is a climber.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.588
You're from Idaho?
City of Rocks!

07:00.621 --> 07:01.689
What?

07:01.722 --> 07:02.856
City of Rocks
National Reserve

07:02.890 --> 07:03.891
in Idaho.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.626
Sweet granite, radical routes.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.129
Never been there?

07:09.162 --> 07:13.200
(dance music playing)

07:22.042 --> 07:26.914
* Merci beaucoup
merci beaucoup *

07:29.182 --> 07:35.556
(singing in French)

07:41.595 --> 07:44.231
*

07:46.133 --> 07:47.701
(grunts)
(chuckles)

07:48.802 --> 07:49.937
Damn it.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.605
That was close!

07:53.106 --> 07:55.643
Want to give it a run?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.977
It's a fun
little problem.

07:57.010 --> 07:57.978
Yeah, I'll spot ya.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.279
Thanks, we have
a fun little

07:59.312 --> 08:00.581
problem of our own though.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.850
About Brian and Andy?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.852
Yeah, heard you two
were close with them.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.286
Hung out all the time.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.755
Yeah, we've been
on a lot of

08:07.788 --> 08:09.690
climbing trips together,
the four of us.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.158
How'd they support themselves?

08:11.191 --> 08:14.261
Brian worked on and off
for a mountain guide service.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.296
Andy's parents sent him cash
now and then.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.731
Yeah, Andy was their only son.

08:17.765 --> 08:18.431
It's got to be tough on them.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.967
And what about
Brian's family?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.101
We've haven't heard from them.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.872
Brian's parents are dead.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.841
Got a cousin
back East, I think.

08:27.875 --> 08:32.045
His family was us, you know,
other climbers.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.747
Come on, big guy.
Pull up the skirt.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.782
We're not on Oprah.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.916
(chuckles)

08:35.949 --> 08:37.150
They say anything to you guys

08:37.184 --> 08:38.886
about coming into
some extra money

08:38.919 --> 08:41.054
or finding something valuable,
anything like that?

08:41.088 --> 08:43.757
Bri called me the
day before he died

08:43.791 --> 08:46.159
and said there was a chance
he'd have a little money soon.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.195
Did he say where the money
was coming from?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.197
He said he found something
he thought he could sell.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.865
But he didn't know
what it was worth

08:51.899 --> 08:53.567
or if it was even
worth anything.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.035
You have any idea
what it was?

08:55.068 --> 08:56.604
He didn't say.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.639
What else did you talk about?

08:58.672 --> 08:59.773
Bri was excited about a new
route he found.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.141
You know, rock climb

09:01.174 --> 09:02.042
nobody'd done before.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.010
THERESA:
Bri said it was

09:03.043 --> 09:04.845
a classic-- might even
be as hard as 5.14.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.814
Said he was gonna
name it Wrecked.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.748
Um,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.717
is, uh, is that where
they were killed?

09:09.750 --> 09:12.152
No, no, the new cliff
was someplace else,

09:12.185 --> 09:13.153
only they
knew where.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.321
PETE: You know, we should try

09:14.354 --> 09:16.289
to find it, do the route.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.759
Name it after Brian and Andy
in their honor, you know?

09:18.792 --> 09:20.227
Yeah, that's what
they would want.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.262
Only, a 5.14 might be a little

09:22.295 --> 09:23.697
over your head,
partner.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.799
Oh, like you're
gonna go first?

09:25.833 --> 09:26.867
Do you see what just happened
on this wall?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.135
- I'm just saying that...
- No, it's not right.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.069
Look, I lead.
You know that.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.904
THERESA: Why you gonna
try to make me...

09:34.041 --> 09:36.009
That's a heck
of a leap, Larry.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.846
Oh, I'm pushing somewhat ahead
of a fully supported thought,

09:38.879 --> 09:41.749
but let's think of this
as a moment of suspension

09:41.782 --> 09:42.816
over a narrow breach.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.284
Just one quick little step

09:44.317 --> 09:46.353
over a small brook
rather than a...

09:46.386 --> 09:47.888
a heck of a leap.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.289
CHARLIE: Hey, what's that
old saying?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.291
Uh, there's speculation,

09:51.324 --> 09:54.027
speculation squared
and cosmology.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.729
(knocking)

09:55.763 --> 09:56.630
Gentlemen, just in time

09:56.664 --> 09:58.799
to save the magic
and grace of physics

09:58.832 --> 10:00.734
from the harsh logic

10:00.768 --> 10:02.169
of these
mathematicians.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.171
What's up, Ian?
It's good to see you, man.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.173
You, too, professor.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.942
I understand you're a threat
to homeland security these days.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.745
Yeah.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.748
So what's up?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.383
Actually, we need to talk
to these two.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.985
Oh.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.386
Oh.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.721
CHARLIE:
Well,

10:20.754 --> 10:23.791
then I will go get some coffee.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.625
Thanks.

10:28.228 --> 10:31.264
Well, that was awkward.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.766
ROBIN:
Charlie.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.101
Oh, hey, Robin.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.103
Uh, Don's in Amita's
office right now.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.105
Actually, I'm here
to talk to you.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.107
I want to help you get
your clearance back.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.775
You do, huh?
Why's that?

10:41.809 --> 10:43.877
To earn a Girl Scout badge,
why do you think?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.045
I've won cases

10:45.078 --> 10:47.080
with evidence that you've found,
Charlie.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.249
And us prosecutors,
we love winning.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.452
I'm persona non grata
at the Bureau.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.388
I'm not the only one
who needs your work.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.357
What about Don?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.928
He's not pushing the issue.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.429
He doesn't want
the headache.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.697
I'm surprised.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.967
I thought the two of you would
be fighting this a lot harder.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.374
AMITA:
Rough diamonds are tough

11:14.407 --> 11:15.408
to trace.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.844
They're uncut.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.746
There's no laser print on file.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.747
No reports of theft yet.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.048
So it could have been
stolen from anywhere.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.482
Or even stolen
many years ago.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.851
AMITA:
You could try

11:23.884 --> 11:25.418
using an optic
crystallographic analysis.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.721
If we had any idea

11:27.755 --> 11:28.856
what that meant.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.057
It's basically shining

11:30.090 --> 11:32.359
a light on the subject.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.027
A diamond is a crystal,

11:34.061 --> 11:37.364
its atoms arranged
in a symmetrical structure.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.133
Optic crystallographic analysis
shines a polarized light

11:40.167 --> 11:42.002
into the crystal structure.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
How the light refracts
could reveal impurities--

11:44.071 --> 11:46.373
nitrogen or sulfur trapped
within the crystal.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.376
And this can tell us where the
diamond was originally found.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.044
Of course the problem
with diamonds

11:51.078 --> 11:53.046
is they don't come from regions,

11:53.080 --> 11:55.048
but from the center
of the earth.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.751
And they're created
in the heat and the pressure

11:57.785 --> 11:59.052
of the earth's mantle.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.453
The very properties

12:00.487 --> 12:01.955
for which diamonds are valued--
the hardness,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.957
the clarity,
the purity--

12:03.991 --> 12:05.092
that's what makes it
difficult

12:05.125 --> 12:08.762
to identify them as coming
from one place or another.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.463
It's a challenge President
Clinton gave scientists

12:10.497 --> 12:12.299
back in 2001
to combat

12:12.332 --> 12:14.067
this problem
of "conflict diamonds."

12:14.101 --> 12:15.268
DAVID:
Welcome to

12:15.302 --> 12:16.937
our special brand of the FBI.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.072
So you can get an idea
of where the diamond's from,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.841
but not for sure?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.009
Yes.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.212
Now, do we know how these
rough diamonds are transported?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.480
In plain cases,
unmarked cars,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.216
carried by
trusted couriers.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.785
Maybe one or two people
know about a shipment.

12:31.819 --> 12:32.953
So the shipments
can't be targeted.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.354
LARRY:
I'm so fascinated by how

12:34.387 --> 12:36.456
this jewel,
from the earth's core,

12:36.489 --> 12:39.059
would up in the chalk bag
of a rock climber.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.994
Yeah, we think he found it.
Didn't know much about diamonds.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.096
I understand tradition holds

12:43.130 --> 12:45.899
that the-the most valuable
of these brings bad luck.

12:45.933 --> 12:50.070
The Hope Diamond, uh,
stolen from an idol,

12:50.103 --> 12:51.471
curses those who touch it.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.272
Ooh.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.977
I didn't think you'd be upset
about the FBI stuff.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.846
ALAN: Yeah. Well, what
I don't like

12:58.879 --> 13:01.481
is they think they can strip you
of your security clearance.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.416
Why? Most of your political
heroes couldn't have

13:03.450 --> 13:05.418
even gotten security clearance.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.120
Look Charlie, I'm very proud
of the way you handled things.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
I mean, you did the right thing
when it wasn't easy.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.958
I knew I'd have to face
the consequences.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.092
Not all of them,
you don't.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.593
There are some people at the FBI
that want to punish you,

13:13.626 --> 13:15.595
and I don't think
they should be able to.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.729
Listen, it doesn't affect
my reputation in my field.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.099
You mean, you don't mind
the federal government imposing

13:19.132 --> 13:21.368
unjust limitations on your work?

13:21.401 --> 13:24.972
Dad, all I need to do my work

13:25.005 --> 13:27.107
is a notebook, pencil...

13:27.140 --> 13:30.978
And lots of chalkboards.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.913
I know.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.016
Just came in.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.619
A report of a missing
diamond shipment.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.889
Oh, yeah? So we got
ourselves a current case?

13:41.922 --> 13:42.822
Very.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.258
Kenneth Bryce,
an L.A. diamond merchant,

13:45.292 --> 13:48.028
was due to deliver 30 stones
to New York yesterday--

13:48.061 --> 13:49.863
worth about $50 million.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.965
He's missing.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.034
Okay, well, get the boys.

13:56.203 --> 13:59.339
The plate matches Bryce's car,
the diamond merchant.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.009
Yeah, he booked a seat
on a commercial charter,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.111
used a false name for
security purposes.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.413
I guess we'll see how well
that worked out for him.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.148
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Service to Reno, Nevada,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.116
your Flight 264
is now boarding...

14:09.149 --> 14:11.151
It's unlocked?

14:11.184 --> 14:13.520
Yep.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.458
It's your turn.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.102
That look like him?

14:29.136 --> 14:30.070
Yeah.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.905
Pretty sure
his diamonds are not with him.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.513
Dead guy is Kenneth Bryce,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.515
a partner with his brother
in Bryce & Sons Jewelers.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.985
Robbed and shot
at the airport.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.054
Colby and I will talk
to the brother,

14:47.087 --> 14:48.455
see who knew
about shipment plans.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.190
Cool.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.458
So, what are
we thinking?

14:51.491 --> 14:55.195
That transporting diamonds is
possibly a more dangerous job

14:55.228 --> 14:56.629
than Alaskan crab fisherman.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.101
Just two people knew
about the shipments:

15:01.134 --> 15:02.502
me and my brother Kenny.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.004
You think he would
have told anyone?

15:05.605 --> 15:07.374
My brother was
a very careful person.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.376
He flew private charters
under pseudonyms.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.378
He never discussed shipments
with anybody but me.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.313
DAVID: Maybe you were overheard,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.082
possibly by
customers, workmen?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.283
I don't see how.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.652
We planned shipments
before shop hours.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.721
You know, our father started
this business,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.556
and Kenny and I worked it
with him.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.525
Bryce & Sons.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.596
Now it's just me.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.401
Let's assume the rock climber
wasn't involved in the robbery.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.602
So, how'd he get the stone?

15:35.635 --> 15:37.304
All right.
The starting point is

15:37.337 --> 15:40.407
a small municipal airport--
private and chartered aircraft.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.042
So, what do we know
about small planes?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.610
They fly.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.145
And they sometimes...

15:45.178 --> 15:46.746
Crash.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.116
Larry, the murdered climbers
had a secret cliff,

15:49.149 --> 15:50.350
with a route they'd
named "Wrecked."

15:50.383 --> 15:53.386
Because maybe they had
found a wreck nearby?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.288
If a plane flying
from that airport crashed

15:55.322 --> 15:58.725
in that area, it was,
without a doubt, flying north.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.660
Private pilots don't always
file flight plans,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.562
and small planes aren't tracked

16:02.595 --> 16:04.097
by radar over their
complete flights.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.599
But the airport logs
show takeoffs

16:06.633 --> 16:08.501
and a general sense
of their destinations.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.470
All right, here's one.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.672
It left El Monte,
scheduled to land in San Jose.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.676
But San Jose didn't log
the arrival.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.846
(beeping)

16:19.879 --> 16:21.648
EDGERTON: We think the robbers
hijacked the diamond merchant

16:21.681 --> 16:22.815
in the airport parking lot,

16:22.849 --> 16:25.285
put the diamonds on a small
plane headed for San Jose.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.719
LARRY: Crashed in the
San Gabriel Mountains,

16:26.753 --> 16:28.521
the climbers found it
and took the diamonds.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.590
All right.
So, who killed them?

16:30.623 --> 16:31.558
Well, theory doesn't
encompass that.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.560
And do we know
who the plane registered to?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.295
Rented by a guy,
using a fake ID.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.129
Transponder?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.297
Well, if it had one,
it wasn't on.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.133
And an aerial search could
easily miss a small plane wreck.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.469
Well, one on foot's
gonna take a month.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.538
Not if we can mathematically
narrow down the search area.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.107
I'll give it a whirl.
Charlie would be faster.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.409
No, that's not gonna happen;
D.C. won't let it.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.278
One more possibility:
we find that secret cliff

16:51.311 --> 16:53.480
these dead climbers
were talking about.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.282
- All right, let's try both.
- Fine.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.385
A flight plan doesn't say

16:58.418 --> 17:01.221
where the plane really was
when it crashed.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.589
Aircraft that go down
over these wilderness areas

17:02.622 --> 17:04.391
are sometimes never found.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.625
Did you know,

17:05.658 --> 17:07.294
more small planes
have disappeared

17:07.327 --> 17:08.628
over the continental U.S.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.663
than have vanished
in the Bermuda Triangle?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.565
Really?

17:12.599 --> 17:13.633
So they said on MythBusters.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.270
Stolen diamond,
missing plane,

17:17.304 --> 17:18.538
murdered climbers--

17:18.571 --> 17:21.208
random pieces.
And yet,

17:21.241 --> 17:24.144
like asteroids
millions of miles apart,

17:24.177 --> 17:27.547
they all orbit
the same source of gravity.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.217
Well, a big diamond
exerts a lot of pull.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.185
Certainly does.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.155
Pete and Skeet?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.357
Nah, man.
They took off for the mountains.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.625
They say where
they were going?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.193
They said they were
headed out to find

17:40.227 --> 17:41.027
Drew and Bri's
secret crag.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.695
I thought no one knows
where it is.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.363
Well, that's not gonna stop
anyone from looking.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.266
So, where would they start?

17:46.299 --> 17:49.369
Well, like the rest of us--
with a good old USGS topo map.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.371
(computer beeping)

17:55.842 --> 17:58.578
(sighs)

17:58.611 --> 18:00.647
That's an
interesting approach.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.714
How interesting?

18:01.748 --> 18:02.649
Moderately interesting.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.384
We're wasting our time.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.119
No, I didn't say that.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.787
I-I mean, this analysis
should garner you

18:07.820 --> 18:09.522
at least half a dozen
target areas.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.358
Eight so far.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.460
Have the FBI send over
some FAA radar data

18:13.493 --> 18:14.594
from the day of the flight.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.663
We tried that;
the signals are too weak

18:16.696 --> 18:19.832
over the mountains to get
an accurate fix.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.635
Have you been looking
for the noisy edge?

18:22.669 --> 18:25.672
The noisy edge
of what?

18:25.705 --> 18:27.174
Larry, Squish-Squash,
remember?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.642
When Charlie tracked
that UFO for Don.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.744
The visitor from space

18:31.778 --> 18:34.514
who was not a
visitor from space.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.283
Oh, my word, that seems like
a hundred years ago.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.151
Tell me about it.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.519
I still have the algorithms
in the computer lab.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.453
They'll take the faint

18:40.487 --> 18:42.222
radar signals,
separate it from the noise

18:42.255 --> 18:43.623
and give us
a probabilistic flight path.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.692
Charlie,

18:45.725 --> 18:46.793
thank you very much.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.197
I was never here.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.776
WOMAN: I'm just gonna fill it
with water, okay?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.679
DON:
All right.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.682
You guys want to canvass around,
see if you get any info?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.721
*

19:35.575 --> 19:37.610
Who else got a lead
on that secret cliff?

19:39.011 --> 19:41.281
Visitor Center employee
said Wright and Tomkins

19:41.314 --> 19:42.682
were in right before
the killings.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.251
Tomkins invited her
to go climbing

19:44.284 --> 19:45.652
along the Cougar Ridge
trailhead.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.754
I talked to a ranger
that saw their car

19:47.787 --> 19:49.456
with no Adventure Pass.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.990
Wrote a summons,
gave me the location.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.727
I got a backpacker who says he
ran across a newly marked trail.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.330
All right, why don't you
guys check those out, huh?

19:57.364 --> 19:58.831
What about you?
You got something?

19:58.865 --> 20:01.368
I got some prospector
who said he heard machinery.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.669
COLBY:
Machinery?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.803
DON:
Yeah, like a drill.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.738
A drill?
In the mountains?

20:05.772 --> 20:08.575
Well, actually climbers will use
them to bolt in anchors.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.876
It's worth checking out.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.378
If just one of these leads
is right,

20:11.411 --> 20:12.845
we find ourselves a secret cliff
and a plane crash.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.814
DON: All right, well, cells
aren't working,

20:14.847 --> 20:16.549
so take the radio
and keep it on.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.786
We'll meet back here
in... two hours?

20:23.523 --> 20:24.557
Hey, Amita.
Hey.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.558
How's it going?

20:25.592 --> 20:26.726
Great,

20:26.759 --> 20:27.994
thanks to you.
You know, I had

20:28.027 --> 20:29.729
no idea that getting
radar data required

20:29.762 --> 20:30.763
a court order.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.434
No problem.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.370
This has got to be awkward
for Charlie.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.505
Um, he's keeping busy.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.006
He actually gets to spend time
with his students now.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.808
Don likes to keep busy, too.

20:41.841 --> 20:45.612
They're both workaholics,
aren't they?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.552
You know, I kid Don that if
he's not working or having sex,

20:52.585 --> 20:53.820
he's thinking
about work...

20:53.853 --> 20:56.489
or sex.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.991
Yeah, with Charlie,
he's having so much fun working

20:59.025 --> 21:00.760
that he can't stop working.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.429
Well, that's a good thing.

21:02.462 --> 21:05.532
Don thinks everything
will fall apart without him.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.833
That's typical oldest kid.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.769
Or the fear of insignificance

21:09.802 --> 21:12.271
in the face
of a little brother genius.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.842
But that's how they've
connected, right? Through work.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.611
Yeah.

21:18.645 --> 21:19.746
And food.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.013
(chuckles):
Yeah, food.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.350
They're a little obsessed
about food.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.751
Yes. Well, they get that
from their dad.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.052
Yeah.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.794
*

21:51.978 --> 21:53.913
(water rushing)

22:06.593 --> 22:07.994
I know why the ranger found

22:08.027 --> 22:10.530
(over radio):
Wright and Tomkins' car here.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.998
They were using
the local bathroom.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.043
And I found the local bar.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.745
(over radio):
So much for this lead.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.949
(birds screeching)

22:29.982 --> 22:31.818
EDGERTON (over radio): You two
join up with me at Cougar Ridge.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.620
I'm looking into
a rocky canyon here

22:33.653 --> 22:34.821
with a lot of possibilities.

22:34.854 --> 22:35.655
Copy that.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.856
NIKKI:
Copy.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.491
THERESA:
We were climbing, that's all.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.959
Eppes?

22:43.996 --> 22:46.766
MAN: All the way out here,
like your friends?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.968
Don, are you reading this?

22:49.001 --> 22:51.438
PETE: Please, just tell us
what you want.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.172
We lost something up here.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.642
Your friends found it,
but they didn't have all of it.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.677
Dude, you're the ones
with the guns.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.079
If we knew anything,
we would tell you.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.715
Only need one of you
to tell us where it is.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.052
Eppes?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.690
(indistinct radio chatter
in distance)

23:18.698 --> 23:22.201
MAN (over radio): ...shifting to
the northwest after midnight.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.505
Tuesday, mostly sunny,
highs 87 to 97.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.875
Light winds becoming less,
five to ten miles an hour

23:28.908 --> 23:29.742
in the afternoon.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.944
Forecast for mountains
and foothills:

23:31.978 --> 23:35.515
the rest of today, mostly sunny,
highs 89 to 99.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.784
Southwest winds,
five miles an hour,

23:37.817 --> 23:40.152
shifting to the southwest
in the afternoon.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.988
(turns off radio)

23:42.021 --> 23:42.922
(grunts)

23:46.726 --> 23:49.762
(gunshot echoing)

23:49.796 --> 23:51.698
(gunfire over radio)

23:55.602 --> 23:56.903
(gunshot)

23:56.936 --> 23:58.605
(gunfire continues)

24:00.172 --> 24:01.107
Go, go, go!

24:03.776 --> 24:05.878
Eppes!

24:15.988 --> 24:17.590
We got people headed out

24:17.624 --> 24:19.726
to search the vicinity
of the shots.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.228
That's a possible 12 miles to
the north and ten miles east.

24:22.261 --> 24:23.763
120 square miles?

24:23.796 --> 24:24.864
It'll take us a
week to cover.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.566
Call in for aerial
recon and get

24:26.599 --> 24:28.535
as many guys out there
as you can; I'll be back.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.036
- Where you going?
- Pasadena.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.170
That's an hour
from here.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.639
Eight minutes by chopper.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.210
Nice job, idiot.
Let's go.

24:47.820 --> 24:51.658
Gian-Carlo Rota of MIT
said that combinatorics

24:51.691 --> 24:53.192
is like putting
different colored marbles

24:53.225 --> 24:54.727
in different colored boxes

24:54.761 --> 24:57.163
and seeing how many ways
you can divide them.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.699
Eppes... we need you.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.000
(whispers):
I can't work for the FBI.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.702
Forget that.
Your brother's in trouble.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.236
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

25:04.270 --> 25:07.006
I'll tell you
en route. Come on.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.274
The rest of you...

25:08.307 --> 25:10.877
take an early recess.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.179
What were you guys
doing up here anyway?

25:13.212 --> 25:14.881
Dude, did you see that crag?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.249
It's got, like, a dozen
classic hard lines on it.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.852
That could be the first
5.15 in California.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.021
We got to find someplace
to hide, I guess.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.291
I always feel safer
above the ground.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.831
I can minimize it further
to account for the idea

25:31.864 --> 25:34.601
that Tomkins and Wright were
two or three miles from a road.

25:34.634 --> 25:35.768
It will take days to finish.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.303
Not with help from JPL.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.271
DAVID: Don's not gonna
like this.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.273
Well, we can argue about that
after we save his ass.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.042
All right, listen:
go to this site.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.646
A friend of mine
has access to classified

25:46.679 --> 25:47.914
National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency imagery.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.649
AMITA:
Got it.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.350
All right, here,
what we're looking at

25:51.383 --> 25:53.052
is a high-definition image
of the San Gabriels

25:53.085 --> 25:55.054
taken off a LandSat

25:55.087 --> 25:56.689
maybe a half
hour ago.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.257
What you want to do
is overlay that

25:58.290 --> 25:59.325
with the probable
flight path.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.727
(typing)

26:00.760 --> 26:03.062
Okay.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.831
There.
There's something right there.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.666
LARRY: To be that big
and reflect that much light

26:06.699 --> 26:07.867
that would have to be

26:07.900 --> 26:09.201
AMITA: Stone.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.637
And a lot of it.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.104
High-alpine granite?

26:12.138 --> 26:13.305
It fits the parameter
of the secret cliff.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.675
It's in the shadow
of the flight path,

26:15.708 --> 26:16.876
and it's two miles
from a road.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.144
Can you pull up the topo--
What's the name

26:18.177 --> 26:20.079
of that canyon?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.213
(computer trilling)

26:21.247 --> 26:22.314
Icehouse Canyon.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.083
LARRY:
Icehouse?

26:24.116 --> 26:25.284
Wait, that's in
the guidebook here.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.154
Wait, wait, wait.
Back in the 1800s,

26:28.187 --> 26:31.891
there was an ice plant there,
serving the gold miners.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.125
Gold miners?

26:33.159 --> 26:34.026
That's the right one.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.196
Edgerton. Get me
back on the mountain.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.895
(cries out)

27:11.864 --> 27:13.132
- Is it broken?
- I don't know.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.000
Doesn't matter. Let's go.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.702
Let's go.
You guys get a head start.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You sure, man?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.270
Yeah, yeah.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.672
There's three of them.
They got bigger guns.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.040
Go, go, go, go, go.
Come on.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.351
EDGERTON (over radio): Agent
Granger, this is Edgerton.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.786
Do you copy?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.321
Go ahead.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.256
Get over to Icehouse Canyon
as fast as you can

27:37.289 --> 27:39.158
with as many people
as you've got.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.227
Right. Got it.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.262
Ian's got a location on Don.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.040
(gun clicks empty)

28:03.916 --> 28:05.217
Let's go. Come on.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.086
Come on.
We got to keep moving, guys.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.254
Come on.
Come on, come on.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.823
Let's go, Pete. Come on, come
on. I know you're hurt--

28:10.857 --> 28:11.991
Hey, hey, get Skeet out of here.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.960
Look, you guys can move.
I can't.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.161
No, no no, I'll hold them off.
Let's go.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.328
How? You're out of ammo, right?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.229
Look, they're not
going to kill me.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.931
They think I know
where the diamonds are.

28:18.965 --> 28:19.966
We're sticking together, come
on!

28:19.999 --> 28:20.967
I can't...

28:21.000 --> 28:22.268
or we're all going to die.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.936
- Come here.
- Pete!

28:23.970 --> 28:25.304
Hey!

28:25.337 --> 28:27.106
Hey!
Go, go, go!

28:27.139 --> 28:29.241
I know where the diamonds are.
I know where they are.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.326
So, what are we
gonna do about Pete?

28:47.359 --> 28:48.394
Soon as you're safe,

28:48.427 --> 28:50.863
I'm gonna get a team
and I'm gonna go after him.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.271
(cocks gun hammer)

28:59.305 --> 29:01.774
You might miss... but I won't.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.778
Finger off the trigger.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.980
Thank you very much.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.050
Hey, how'd you find us?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.218
(indistinct radio transmission)

29:12.251 --> 29:14.854
Well, I could tell you,
but you're not gonna like it.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.488
What? Charlie.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.257
Still, it came down to the wire.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.192
This clown was gonna
pop your brain box.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.360
Yeah. What about the other two?

29:21.393 --> 29:22.461
Where's Pete?

29:22.494 --> 29:24.396
Bumbles here said they had
a jeep on the fire road.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.932
Nikki and Colby found tracks;
the vehicle's gone.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.533
- We got a chopper searching.
- All right.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.435
CHARLIE (over radio):
Ian? Can you hear me?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.370
Yeah, let me hand you
to your brother.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.839
Hey, Don, you okay?

29:32.872 --> 29:34.073
DON: Yeah, Charlie, I'm fine.
Where you at?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.341
I'm at the FBI.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.043
Listen, I think
we found the plane.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.980
The coordinates
are latitude 34.5733,

29:41.013 --> 29:44.216
longitude minus 118.1216.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.484
Okay, got it.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.486
And, Charlie...

29:47.519 --> 29:49.188
thank you very much.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.223
- Sure.
- But get out of there

29:51.257 --> 29:52.191
before the assistant director
sees you.

29:52.224 --> 29:54.326
Otherwise we're both screwed,
you hear me?

29:56.462 --> 29:58.130
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:02.568 --> 30:04.470
DON:
Check this out.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.072
Diamonds are long gone, huh?

30:06.105 --> 30:08.140
And they think Pete
knows where they are?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.542
How good a liar is he?

30:21.587 --> 30:23.255
No ID.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.991
And he's not talking.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.558
And the other two
evaded a dragnet

30:26.592 --> 30:28.160
with a hostage.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.296
Body on the plane
had a fake ID.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.598
And we have no name
on the live one we got.

30:32.631 --> 30:35.134
But what we do know
is that this robbery crew

30:35.167 --> 30:38.137
was able to learn details
about a secret diamond shipment.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.940
So, maybe they left some
record of how they did that.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.084
DAVID:
There.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.585
That's the dead guy
from the plane.

30:53.619 --> 30:55.988
Other one matches
the description Don gave.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.024
Bet they're not there
to buy an engagement ring.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.591
Mm-mm.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.064
Yep. Got it.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.465
They tried to bug our store?

31:06.498 --> 31:07.466
That's impossible.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.002
The entire store
is electronically shielded.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.370
They knew about
the shipment.

31:11.403 --> 31:14.140
They must've figured a way
around that.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.541
To get past
the electronic shield

31:15.574 --> 31:16.742
that was installed in the store,

31:16.775 --> 31:20.046
this device was wired to a small
satellite dish on the roof.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.981
That way, it sends a signal
to the satellite,

31:22.014 --> 31:24.016
which in turn relays it
to the receiver on the ground.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.185
That means that the robbers
could've been

31:26.218 --> 31:27.186
listening in
from anywhere.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.455
Well, that's true, but...

31:29.488 --> 31:31.090
we know where the dish
was pointed,

31:31.123 --> 31:33.059
we also know
there are very few satellites

31:33.092 --> 31:36.195
that would even accept
such an anonymous signal,

31:36.228 --> 31:39.198
So, we should be able to
identify the satellite involved.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.500
Can we get a precise date
and time

31:41.533 --> 31:42.668
for the conversation
overheard?

31:42.701 --> 31:45.071
Yeah, we can do that.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.605
A comprehensive geometrical
analysis should be able

31:46.638 --> 31:48.207
to provide
the probable locations

31:48.240 --> 31:49.341
for such a receiver.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.343
Do it fast.
They've got a hostage.

31:53.012 --> 31:56.148
Larry, this analysis
is pretty deep stuff.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.017
Do you know
how to do it?

31:58.050 --> 32:00.152
I know how...

32:00.186 --> 32:02.288
to get it done.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.497
Charlie, listen,

32:11.530 --> 32:14.233
to quote the late Paul Erdos,
"Is your brain open?"

32:14.266 --> 32:16.135
Uh, as long as it has nothing
to do with the FBI case.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.104
I mean, it was one thing
when Don was missing, but...

32:18.137 --> 32:20.072
No, this is purely
particle physics research.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.273
Okay, I have a problem

32:21.307 --> 32:24.310
with the bubble chamber
analysis program

32:24.343 --> 32:26.178
that I've been using
to identify ellipses

32:26.212 --> 32:28.480
in particle track data.
- Okay.

32:28.514 --> 32:31.017
I ran it past Dr. Tolenson,
who said he didn't understand...

32:31.050 --> 32:33.252
Wait. What do you mean,
you showed it to Dr. Tolenson?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.254
No. No.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.056
Tolenson attacked my paper
on lattice theory.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.091
He tried to get my space
in the faculty parking lot.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.292
I waited five years
for that space.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.427
- I didn't know...
- Let me see it.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.195
- Let me see that problem.
- I could run this past...

32:43.229 --> 32:44.496
No, let me see it.
Give it to me.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.298
I want to see it.

32:49.201 --> 32:50.669
Maybe you can help us
out with something.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.471
We know that Andy and Brian
found the plane wreck.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.373
But why didn't
they report it

32:54.406 --> 32:57.076
instead of going on to another
cliff to climb some more?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.311
Man, you got to
understand climbers.

32:59.345 --> 33:02.214
They probably figured,
hey, the guy's already dead.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.215
There's no rush.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.217
At least they got
their priorities straight.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.585
THERESA:
Bri and Drew

33:06.618 --> 33:09.188
were good guys, but...

33:09.221 --> 33:12.324
they didn't do a lot
of deep thinking, you know?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.229
You think Pete's still alive?

33:20.499 --> 33:22.301
We're working
under that assumption.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.303
Lot of people
trying to find him.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.173
He's a brave guy.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.541
Risked his life
to save Agent Eppes.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.411
And me.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.222
All right.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.756
Now, this should work.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.592
You gonna show this
to Tolenson right now?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.295
'Cause I'd love to be there to
see his face when he sees this.

33:49.328 --> 33:52.231
Well... not at this instant, no.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.399
Larry?

33:55.834 --> 33:58.270
Larry's analysis of the signals
sent to the device

33:58.304 --> 34:00.506
we found at the jewelry store
pinpoints a house

34:00.539 --> 34:02.741
rented under the name
James Meyers.

34:02.774 --> 34:06.178
Interpol lists that as an alias
used by this guy:

34:06.212 --> 34:08.214
Alex Rezar.

34:08.247 --> 34:11.217
Known associate of...

34:11.250 --> 34:12.551
Keith Jackson and Nigel Moore.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.221
All right, well,
since we got Moore,

34:15.254 --> 34:16.722
let's bring in
his friends then, right?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.725
(door closes)

34:25.364 --> 34:26.798
I don't think
that kid knows

34:26.832 --> 34:30.269
where the rest of
those diamonds are.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.271
Then it's over.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.405
Can't go back
to the wreck site.

34:33.439 --> 34:35.574
The FBI knows
about it.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.309
You know, I was wondering...

34:37.343 --> 34:40.212
how'd you know
where the crash was?

34:40.246 --> 34:42.781
I put a tracking device
on the plane.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.751
The pilot--
you didn't trust him?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.388
I trust you.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.257
I trust Moore.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.359
That's it.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.261
What about the kid?

34:55.294 --> 34:57.263
We're done with him.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.672
(gasping)

35:06.705 --> 35:08.574
Hold still.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.842
It'll just take longer
and hurt more.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.344
Screw you.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.679
FBI!
Stay where you are!

35:13.712 --> 35:16.182
Hands!
I need to see some hands!

35:16.215 --> 35:17.816
Freeze! Get 'em up.
Get 'em up now!

35:17.849 --> 35:19.785
- Federal agents!
- Hands up!

35:19.818 --> 35:21.320
Get 'em up!

35:22.588 --> 35:24.556
- I got it!
- Clear!

35:24.590 --> 35:25.557
Clear!
Nice and easy.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.259
Get your hands
on your head.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.560
Keep 'em up there.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.728
Turn around.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.730
Hey, that'll
look good on you.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.765
OFFICER: All right,
bring 'em out.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.734
You got him?
(handcuffs clicking)

35:35.767 --> 35:37.303
(indistinct radio transmissions)

35:37.336 --> 35:39.838
Roll over.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.540
We'll get you
to a medic. Come on.

35:41.573 --> 35:42.774
Can you stand up?
- Yeah.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.909
- I got ya.
- Get up.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.516
ME's report
on the dead pilot.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.685
Check out
the tox screen.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.421
Drugged.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.489
Out cold when he crashed.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.458
You thinking what
I'm thinking?

35:59.491 --> 36:02.194
No honor among thieves.

36:02.228 --> 36:05.264
REZAR:
We want lawyers.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.365
EDGERTON:
Sure.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.400
Right after story time.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.469
The story's about four guys
who bugged a jewelry store

36:10.502 --> 36:12.504
to find out when a shipment
of diamonds was going out.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.440
They killed the owner.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.208
The stash went
on a light plane headed north.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.676
Drugged the pilot.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.479
Plane crashed.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.313
Climbers found
the wreck,

36:21.347 --> 36:22.781
but they didn't find
all the stash.

36:22.814 --> 36:23.782
You want to
know why?

36:23.815 --> 36:25.617
Because one of you

36:25.651 --> 36:27.619
slipped most of the
diamonds out of the case,

36:27.653 --> 36:29.588
left enough to fool the pilot.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.457
Then maybe
offered him a swig

36:31.490 --> 36:33.392
from a flask, something
like that, huh?

36:33.425 --> 36:35.227
DON: They figured the plane
would go down

36:35.261 --> 36:37.329
and nobody would know
those diamonds weren't on it.

36:37.363 --> 36:40.366
Didn't know I'd planted a
tracker on the damn plane.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.368
EDGERTON: And all of you went
on a wild goose chase

36:42.401 --> 36:44.770
through the mountains looking
for the missing diamonds,

36:44.803 --> 36:46.572
(chuckling)
but one of you already had 'em.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.416
We could have been rich
and in Europe by now.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.684
Instead of busted
in L.A.

37:00.486 --> 37:01.353
Sit down.

37:02.454 --> 37:05.257
You won't be safe in prison.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.358
I promise you.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.470
I thought
you were dead!

37:18.504 --> 37:20.372
(gasping)

37:28.947 --> 37:31.917
I guess he's finally figured out
she's a girl.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.419
Yeah.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.020
Wonder if that'll mess
with the climbing.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.332
DON:
Right, got it. Thanks.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.835
Diamonds are
in a safe deposit box

37:49.868 --> 37:52.270
registered to our friend
Keith Jackson.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.408
We couldn't have done it
without Charlie.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.844
You have no idea
the flak I'm getting.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.514
Well, you do the job right,

38:02.548 --> 38:04.350
you're going to catch it.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.585
That's life
in the Bureau.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.487
I guess.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.428
Hey.

38:16.462 --> 38:17.863
Thanks for the help.

38:17.896 --> 38:18.797
Don't mention it.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.566
I would have signed up
for the FBI sooner

38:20.599 --> 38:21.900
if I knew
it'd be like this.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.502
Yeah, I'm pretty
damn great, aren't I?

38:23.535 --> 38:24.503
I meant the case.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.504
So did I.

38:25.537 --> 38:26.605
Uh-huh.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.510
ROBIN:
You know, Charlie,

38:31.543 --> 38:33.445
for someone
who can't work for the FBI,

38:33.479 --> 38:35.113
you seem to have done
a lot of work

38:35.146 --> 38:36.114
on this case.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.215
More than you know.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.618
Well, you know, Ian doesn't
give you much choice.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.552
Yeah, he's tough
to say no to,

38:40.586 --> 38:41.787
that guy.

38:41.820 --> 38:42.854
CHARLIE:
Guy can kill a person

38:42.888 --> 38:43.889
from 1,000
yards away.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.391
LIZ:
See, this only makes

38:45.424 --> 38:46.525
my argument for me.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.527
I really think you should
appeal the FBI's decision.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.529
(sighs)

38:50.562 --> 38:52.398
Yeah, me, too.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.400
You do?

38:54.433 --> 38:56.768
Yeah, I do.

38:56.802 --> 38:59.137
Look, you're
not a threat.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.506
Come on, they know it.

39:01.607 --> 39:03.409
And you don't think

39:03.442 --> 39:05.043
it would make things
more awkward for you?

39:05.076 --> 39:06.478
(Don sighs)

39:07.579 --> 39:09.548
Ah, whatever, screw it.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.583
They can't mess with us.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.018
There's a tough guy.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.586
The fighting Eppes Brothers.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.657
CHARLIE:
All right,

39:18.690 --> 39:20.859
I'll do it.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.428
I'll appeal their decision.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.634
ALAN:
You know, the first time

39:28.667 --> 39:31.169
my wife and I took Charlie to
the pediatrician for an earache,

39:31.202 --> 39:32.671
he wouldn't let the doctor
examine his ears

39:32.704 --> 39:34.473
because he thought
the doctor might just see

39:34.506 --> 39:35.841
the thinking going on
in his head.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.576
The doctor
declared Charlie

39:37.609 --> 39:39.010
the second most stubborn kid
he'd ever met.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.579
And the first?

39:40.612 --> 39:41.580
Uh...

39:41.613 --> 39:43.515
don't tell me.
Don?

39:43.549 --> 39:45.016
You got it.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.686
Particle physicists
like to use pool balls

39:47.719 --> 39:50.088
to describe the actions
of subatomic particles,

39:50.121 --> 39:51.757
but actually, these
massive spheres

39:51.790 --> 39:55.661
behave in a far
more predictable,

39:55.694 --> 39:57.095
even Newtonian manner.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.431
Now, let's say that
this cue ball has

39:59.465 --> 40:00.832
the characteristics
of a boson.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.669
He's stalling because
he doesn't have a shot.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.003
No, no, no, no, no.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.006
I shall call this shot...

40:08.039 --> 40:11.042
the Fleinhardt Boson.

40:14.112 --> 40:15.714
(laughing):
The flying what?

40:15.747 --> 40:16.782
(laughs)

40:16.815 --> 40:18.584
LARRY:
Just as I intended.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.688
Let's see either of you take
your shot from behind the dryer.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.591
Uh, well, it's your shot.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.625
Yeah.

40:26.658 --> 40:28.594
(laughter)
