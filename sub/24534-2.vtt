WEBVTT

01:34.260 --> 01:35.716
Your family?

01:37.010 --> 01:39.387
Can you tell me anything about them?

01:42.220 --> 01:44.097
I don't want to talk about it.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.553
That's okay.
We can talk about something else.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.310
Like what?

01:53.980 --> 01:58.735
Like, what was
your favourite subject in school?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.070
Music.

02:03.870 --> 02:05.189
Favourite food?

02:08.370 --> 02:09.621
Pizza.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.661
What about least favourite food?

02:17.590 --> 02:19.581
Salmon patties.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.558
Salmon patties? What's a salmon patty?

02:23.850 --> 02:28.298
It's like, canned salmon with mayonnaise,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.398
bread crumbs and onions, grilled in a pan.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.147
Ugh.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.027
Oh, that sounds terrible.

02:37.360 --> 02:40.409
Spend your whole life swimming upstream,
end up a patty.

02:42.370 --> 02:45.328
Yeah. Should've swam the other way.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.702
Yeah, should've.

03:00.590 --> 03:03.639
I know living here is gonna
take a while to get used to.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.216
But this is home, now.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.977
And I want it to feel that way.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.642
I'll do everything I can
to make that happen.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.850
I just need you to help me a little bit.

03:30.330 --> 03:33.413
What direction were you coming from
when you found us?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.217
Good morning, fol/(s,

04:22.300 --> 04:24.928
this is your friendly
morning wake-up call.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.388
It’s another beaut/fu/ day
with clear skies.

04:27.470 --> 04:31.133
And for those keeping scone,
today is a big one.

04:31.230 --> 04:35.439
Today marks 365 days in the Diamond.

04:36.360 --> 04:40.524
You heard the man.
We're celebrating today.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.646
With syrup.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.310
Hey, cut him some slack.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.868
Do you know how hard it is
to find Vermont Fancy in Texas?

04:51.160 --> 04:53.902
It's the finest vintage. Yeah.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.783
- Now on my eggs.
- Yeah, on your eggs.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.422
Was she up all night again?

05:08.180 --> 05:09.636
Mom?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.635
Mom.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.055
You missed breakfast.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.687
The kid needs a place of her own.

05:16.770 --> 05:18.647
I was thinking about
putting the bed over here.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.733
- Did you get any sleep?
- A couple hours.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.868
Well, we've got the run today.

05:27.950 --> 05:28.985
I'm fine, Nick.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.152
Tell your sister
I'll be there in a little while.

05:31.870 --> 05:32.746
What?

05:34.620 --> 05:37.612
Can anyone around here
give me a courtesy laugh?

05:37.710 --> 05:40.201
I survived out there on a lot less
than a couple of hours of sleep.

05:40.960 --> 05:44.123
Yeah, and you were a lot crankier.
Maybe a bit funnier.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.887
- See? I can do it.
- No.

05:47.970 --> 05:51.349
Caffeinate. We are leaving in 20.

05:57.730 --> 06:00.472
Did you know
he only lived to be 27?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.221
I think you might've mentioned it.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.812
And did you know people say
he might've sold his soul to the devil?

06:08.110 --> 06:10.237
Thats what
Cross Road Blues
is about, right?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.519
Uh-huh.

06:13.950 --> 06:15.577
What's wrong with the turnips?

06:17.120 --> 06:18.576
I'm not sure.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.589
Looks like someone swallowed them,
and puked them back up.

06:24.670 --> 06:28.254
Well, look at it this way,
it's one less vegetable you gotta eat.

06:28.340 --> 06:29.295
I like vegetables.

06:30.050 --> 06:31.210
How old are you?

06:32.430 --> 06:34.512
How much food do we have in the pantries?

06:35.270 --> 06:38.433
- Mmm, enough.
- Yeah, but

06:38.520 --> 06:41.557
how long would it last
if it was all we had?

06:41.650 --> 06:46.098
Charlie, you don't need to worry
about stuff like that any more.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.487
You know, we're almost growing enough,

06:49.070 --> 06:51.561
so, we won't have to
go out there for anything.

06:58.370 --> 06:59.667
Come on.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.837
Let's look at the cabbages.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.911
- Charlie's family?
- She said they're out there.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.878
- You got her to talk about it?
- Not exactly. She pointed.

07:08.970 --> 07:09.925
But I checked her book.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.796
It's from the public library
out in Bartlett.

07:11.930 --> 07:14.717
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.
That's outside the range.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.131
I thought we agreed
nobody goes outside the range.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.630
We did, but this is a special case.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.379
The kid can't look for her family
on her own.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.515
We have to do it for her.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.261
We don't even know if they're alive.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.759
Yeah, but we didn't know you were alive,

07:24.860 --> 07:27.146
and Viv convinced us to look for you,
and look how that turned out.

07:27.230 --> 07:29.141
I wasn't out of range.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.653
_It wouldn't have mattered to me
If you were. What about you, VIv?

07:34.580 --> 07:39.358
All right.
Radio us back the second you can. Okay?

07:39.460 --> 07:40.358
Let's go.

08:15.950 --> 08:18.657
Hey. You mind giving me a hand?

08:22.290 --> 08:24.918
Ain't a road trip without snacks.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.376
Aren't you on watch today?

08:28.250 --> 08:30.411
Seems like you know my schedule
better than I do.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.296
Because I made it.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.120
And I put you on watch for a reason.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.881
Lucy.

08:40.100 --> 08:44.184
- Change your mind?
- No. That kid needs a new book.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.226
Think you can find her one
while you're out there?

08:47.150 --> 08:49.015
Well, you should come and help me look.

08:49.110 --> 08:51.317
Well, I've got a turnip situation.

08:52.110 --> 08:55.068
- Don't you get bored in here?
- I do, yeah. It's great.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.366
It is.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.156
You wanna just stare at a wall later?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.195
- Deal.
- Yes.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.282
I'll bring the jicama.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.782
Can you make sure
she comes back this time?

09:03.910 --> 09:04.956
Mmm-hmm.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.780
You're never gonna let that go, huh?

09:08.880 --> 09:10.620
Eventually, I might.

09:11.630 --> 09:14.258
Let's go, let's go.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.256
Be careful.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.361
He's gotta come out sometime.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.325
He will when it's right.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.707
You weren't there when I found him, Lucy.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.502
He just needs to be in a place
where he feels safe right now.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.276
Will you just have a drink
with the guy already?

10:21.740 --> 10:24.482
Madison, you know I only drink with you.

10:25.870 --> 10:27.861
You guys 5177/ in range?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.376
What is it?

10:30.460 --> 10:32.121
I ﬁgured out
what’s wrong with the turn/,‘os.

10:32.630 --> 10:36.168
Weevils. They got to the roots.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.791
We're gonna have to dig them all up.

10:41.430 --> 10:44.308
You need us to look for pesticides
while we're here?

10:48.190 --> 10:53.059
Nick? Nick? You copy?

10:55.650 --> 10:58.733
And so ends our broadcast day.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.158
Okay, Luciana, you go with Strand.
Alicia, you come with me.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.333
You know how it works. Eyes open,
stay close, keep talking.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.298
Any sign of Charlie's family, radio us.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.535
Clear.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.836
This place
has been picked clean.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.660
There's nothing left.

12:03.680 --> 12:06.217
Some avaricious
looters got to th/s place.

12:06.300 --> 12:09.975
They took everything.
Even the light bulbs.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.311
What do you think it means?

12:21.030 --> 12:24.238
I don't know. Come on.

12:42.760 --> 12:43.920
Oh...

12:45.300 --> 12:47.177
I bet this camp
is where Charlie's from.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.967
Kid's lucky she got out of here alive.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.056
You guys see any signs of survivors?

12:56.150 --> 13:01.349
None. And it's not only the survivors
who are in absentia.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.731
The dead. Where are they?

13:03.820 --> 13:07.119
_ We haven't seen_one
smce we entered this burg.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.156
Yeah, neither have we.

13:19.670 --> 13:20.955
Hang on.

13:25.050 --> 13:28.429
We're gonna be another minute.
I think there's someone around here.

13:28.510 --> 13:31.764
Looks like one person.
I found what's left of their lunch.

13:31.850 --> 13:33.260
Copy-

13:36.230 --> 13:39.051
You know, she won't go back
until she looks under every rock.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.060
Ha.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.469
It's the only reason I'm here.

13:42.570 --> 13:43.980
Only reason we're all here.

13:44.320 --> 13:48.859
Well, she didn't just find me down there.
She saved me, and she didn't have to.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.229
Well, you know what she says.

13:52.330 --> 13:56.494
I do. But I made a pretty powerful
argument to the contrary.

13:59.330 --> 14:03.255
Still never asked her
why she helped me after what I did.

14:07.510 --> 14:08.465
Ask her.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.723
Hey. What are you doing?

14:19.310 --> 14:20.641
Nothing.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.982
It's okay.
They haven't been gone that long.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.077
I know it wasn't a regular run.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.359
Well, look, we didn't want to tell you

14:36.450 --> 14:38.247
because we didn't
want you to get your hopes up.

14:38.330 --> 14:41.242
But if your family is out there,
we'll find them.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.796
Why don't you ever go out there?

14:44.670 --> 14:46.376
'Cause I like it better in here.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.588
Now, you gonna help me
with those puke turnips?

15:12.870 --> 15:14.656
Mom, did you find anything?

15:14.780 --> 15:16.691
Don't.

15:16.790 --> 15:17.745
Mom?

15:18.710 --> 15:19.995
Now, turn around.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.048
Your keys. Hand them over.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.675
You don't have to do this.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.470
The keys.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.356
Shit.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.493
We have a settlement. Strong walls.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.283
Plenty of food. Good people.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.411
It's the truth.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.121
We just took in a kid.

16:11.130 --> 16:15.544
Says she's from around here somewhere.
A little girl.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.518
Named Charlie? You know her?

16:21.600 --> 16:23.648
I don't have a kid.

16:26.230 --> 16:27.970
Please just stop.

16:42.830 --> 16:43.706
It's okay.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.079
Easy there.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.384
Wait!

17:05.190 --> 17:06.054
Madison!

17:10.320 --> 17:12.390
Please, put it down.

17:17.530 --> 17:20.192
We're not gonna hurt you.
You can trust us.

17:21.580 --> 17:23.901
You need help? Hell, you need the car.
We'll give it to you.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.375
Don't...

17:46.350 --> 17:48.477
It's okay! We'll get you out!

17:48.900 --> 17:50.015
Get the hatch open.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.080
It's rusted shut.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.256
- Stay close.
- I'm trying!

18:28.810 --> 18:30.892
Good, good, good. Push, push.

19:20.610 --> 19:21.656
Mom?

19:55.110 --> 19:59.103
Madison, who on God's Earth did we risk
life and limb to save this time?

20:02.320 --> 20:05.733
I didn't get a chance to ask her name
when she had me at gunpoint.

20:07.450 --> 20:08.826
Hey.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.457
No one's gone til! they're gone.

20:16.630 --> 20:17.995
Naomi.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.967
My name is Naomi.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.593
I'm sorry. I wasn't going to hurt you.

20:33.850 --> 20:36.057
Well, somebody led them into the tank.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.680
Any idea who?

20:40.030 --> 20:43.272
I just camped there last night.
I'm not from here.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.237
Where are you from?

20:49.370 --> 20:54.490
It's been a long time
since I've been from anywhere.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.371
You've been travelling this whole time?

20:58.460 --> 21:00.291
The whole time.

21:11.060 --> 21:14.689
We should leave. Now.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.597
- We gotta do something.
- Like what?

21:54.680 --> 21:58.935
I don't know, go out there and figure out
where that music came from.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.853
Maybe it was something to do with
why they're not back yet.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.932
You know,
maybe it was them trying to signal us.

22:05.030 --> 22:08.238
Look, I know you're worried
about your family,

22:08.320 --> 22:12.654
but let's just wait,
see if we hear it again.

22:32.970 --> 22:34.676
I need you to open the gate.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.636
I can do that.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.180
Easy.

24:14.820 --> 24:15.980
Nick, get back here.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.791
Nick, what are you doing?

24:33.090 --> 24:34.751
You know, just taking a stroll.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.638
What happened to you?

24:38.350 --> 24:39.760
Get in.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.941
Charlie, can we talk for a second?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.490
It's okay.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.826
I know you didn't find them.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.205
I'm sorry.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.172
I've gotta ask you another
question, though. It's not an easy one.

25:24.140 --> 25:28.395
What happened at your camp?
Do you know who did that?

25:39.030 --> 25:41.328
We can talk about it another time.

25:49.290 --> 25:51.918
- Thanks.
- Least I could do.

25:54.510 --> 25:56.250
Are you a nurse or a doctor?

25:57.220 --> 25:58.255
Nurse.

25:59.890 --> 26:00.925
What kind?

26:03.350 --> 26:07.844
Last answer. No more questions.
ER, then ICU.

26:15.070 --> 26:17.061
Hey, how'd she take it?

26:17.150 --> 26:18.981
I don't think it was a surprise.

26:20.030 --> 26:22.407
All right, I'll go check on her.
Thank you.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.379
You didn't tell me your camp
was a baseball stadium.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.291
You didn't believe I had a camp.

26:39.260 --> 26:42.343
- How many people live here?
- Forty-seven.

26:43.510 --> 26:45.421
Forty-eight, if you decide to stay.

26:49.850 --> 26:52.603
I pulled a gun on you.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.100
But you didn't shoot.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.659
I've done a lot worse
when I was out there. We all did.

27:04.620 --> 27:07.532
I thought I lost my kids for good
because of it.

27:11.420 --> 27:13.081
But I found them.

27:14.380 --> 27:19.500
And then we found this place,
and we built it up, together.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.968
We are who we are because of it.

27:26.310 --> 27:27.800
You don't even know me.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.727
And you don't know us.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.930
So, we're both taking a chance.

27:42.820 --> 27:44.481
I know it's a lot.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.650
Why don't you see how you feel
after a shower?

27:54.630 --> 27:55.915
A shower?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.206
Uh-huh.

27:58.670 --> 28:00.126
- Is the water--
- Yeah.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.178
But you gotta turn the knob all the way
to the right to get it really hot.

28:14.690 --> 28:16.897
Hit them if they get within 50 feet of us.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.310
Copy.

28:24.530 --> 28:28.409
You know, I could've helped you guys
out there if he'd let me come along.

28:30.410 --> 28:33.823
I don ’t think thats why
he didn ’t want you to come.

28:33.960 --> 28:37.418
Well, then what's the deal? He acts like
he doesn't want to get to know me.

28:38.210 --> 28:40.371
It might be the other way around.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.672
Does he really think
that's going to stop me?

28:47.600 --> 28:48.919
Luce?

28:55.690 --> 28:58.727
You guys need to get inside right now!

28:58.820 --> 29:00.890
Why? What’s wrong?

29:00.990 --> 29:03.311
Ditch the truck right now!

29:20.050 --> 29:21.039
Lock the gate.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.001
Who the hell is that?

29:25.090 --> 29:26.580
Get to the armory. Bring everything.

31:50.070 --> 31:52.652
You picked one hell of a night to join us.

32:47.250 --> 32:48.160
There a problem?

32:50.130 --> 32:53.679
We're good. You want one?

32:56.760 --> 33:00.594
We got a lot of people inside
with a lot of guns.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.386
That's a hell of a welcome.

33:03.730 --> 33:07.018
We saw what you did
to that camp by those tanks.

33:08.270 --> 33:09.601
You think we did that?

33:09.690 --> 33:11.567
Well, your flag was flying over it.

33:11.650 --> 33:16.519
Yeah. Because _we had to
clean up their mess.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.076
You see, the thing no one thought about

33:19.160 --> 33:22.869
when they built the camp
between all those giant metal drums,

33:22.960 --> 33:26.282
is what would happen if the bleeder valve
got jammed on one of those things.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.873
We warned them, but they didn't listen.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.329
Pooﬁ

33:37.180 --> 33:39.501
What do you want from us?

33:39.600 --> 33:43.263
We want you... to listen.

33:45.520 --> 33:50.389
'Cause you have a mess
of your own out here. Don't you?

33:50.480 --> 33:54.894
A bad batch of turnips, from what I hear.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.192
You should tell Nick to check
the rest of his crops, too,

33:59.280 --> 34:03.068
because the weevils
are a bitch to get rid of.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.911
How the hell do you know his name?

34:10.500 --> 34:11.455
Come here, kiddo!

34:30.060 --> 34:31.561
Ah.

34:31.650 --> 34:35.188
Hey. Come here. How you doing?

34:36.070 --> 34:38.106
Did they take good care of you? Huh?

34:39.490 --> 34:41.026
I'm so sorry we were late.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.577
I just had to clear the road
of the fallen back there,

34:43.660 --> 34:45.696
so, we could chat out here, uninterrupted.

34:46.660 --> 34:50.573
But I got you some new records on the bus.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.297
Go on, get in there. Good girl.

35:08.890 --> 35:10.551
God, she's a good kid.

35:12.520 --> 35:15.068
We found her a while back.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.109
Turns out she has a real knack
for finding the good stuff.

35:25.330 --> 35:29.573
Boy, she hit the jackpot here.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.161
You're not taking anything from us.

35:34.420 --> 35:36.957
People always say that.

35:37.050 --> 35:42.499
You see,
we're not taking anything from anyone.

35:42.590 --> 35:45.218
Anyone who's alive, aanay.

35:48.390 --> 35:52.474
You see, look... I've had
this conversation a hundred times.

35:54.610 --> 35:57.773
We know that you're good people. Yeah?

35:58.320 --> 36:02.859
With 27 machine guns,
six rifles, 14 handguns,

36:02.950 --> 36:06.329
six dozen hand grenades,
and until recently, a great crop yield,

36:06.410 --> 36:12.076
but there is a natural cycle
to a place like this. Okay?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.819
And yours is about to run out.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.495
So, there's two ways this can go.

36:16.590 --> 36:20.833
Either you give us your stuff, and live.

36:20.920 --> 36:25.038
I mean, hell, you can join us.
You can become one of us.

36:26.890 --> 36:31.054
Or we wait for you all to die
trying to make things work.

36:32.730 --> 36:37.315
Either way, I end up with that gun
on your hip, and whatever else I want.

36:40.190 --> 36:44.103
That's not a threat,
that's just the way it goes.

36:47.910 --> 36:50.822
I'm Mel, by the way.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.911
We're not going anywhere.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.911
Yeah, I've heard that before, too.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.750
We've lived like you.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.719
Moving from place to place,
doing whatever it took to make it.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.176
We're not going back to that life.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.459
You saying you're better than us?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.630
I'm saying we found a better way.

37:15.190 --> 37:16.646
'Cause you live in there in those walls,

37:16.730 --> 37:18.436
you don't have to do the sorts of things
we have to do?

37:18.520 --> 37:19.930
Let me tell you something.

37:21.070 --> 37:23.026
You just haven't been tested yet.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.026
But you're about to be.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.117
If you change your mind,
we'll be out here, waiting.

41:15.550 --> 41:17.347
We're not who you think we are.

41:17.430 --> 41:19.386
Hey, help yourself.

41:23.190 --> 41:24.805
Leave that one be. Leave it--

41:24.900 --> 41:26.265
Okay, okay. All right, all right.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.237
You're with them!

41:46.210 --> 41:47.780
With who?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.410
The Vultures.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.121
I don't know what that means.

41:58.220 --> 42:01.553
Maybe if you assholes put your guns down,
we could help each other.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.973
Who put that flag up?
What did they do to you?

42:06.060 --> 42:07.516
How about you answer our questions?

42:09.860 --> 42:12.522
- That flag isn't yours?
- No.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.612
All right. Show us where you found it.
