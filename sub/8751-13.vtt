WEBVTT

00:05.555 --> 00:07.924
He's big, and he is powerful.

00:07.925 --> 00:10.693
He knows that there's people here.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.862
I was immediately freaked out.

00:12.863 --> 00:15.263
It is mean.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.566
Pure hatred and anger.

00:17.567 --> 00:19.969
It scared the living crap out of me.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.505
It has bad intentions.

00:22.506 --> 00:24.908
He was diagnosed with psychosis.

00:24.909 --> 00:27.143
- That's no way to live.
- No.

00:27.144 --> 00:30.211
- Are they dangerous?
- Yes, they are.

00:30.212 --> 00:32.852
They're cursed.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.963
They're being watched.

00:35.964 --> 00:38.988
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.989 --> 00:41.190
This thing likes death.

00:41.191 --> 00:42.809
I see dead people.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.560
This thing's, like, a monster.

00:44.561 --> 00:46.595
I speak to dead people.

00:46.596 --> 00:48.282
And he's pissed off now.

00:48.283 --> 00:49.676
And they speak to me.

00:49.677 --> 00:51.403
His head was cracked.

00:51.404 --> 00:54.904
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.905 --> 00:56.395
This guy was murdered.

00:56.396 --> 00:57.893
I rely on my partner.

00:57.894 --> 00:59.306
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:59.307 --> 01:01.165
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.879
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.216
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.217 --> 01:08.526
You saw her?

01:08.527 --> 01:09.885
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.886 --> 01:10.954
Why would you stay here?

01:10.955 --> 01:13.244
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.245 --> 01:15.325
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.692
Until the very end.

01:16.693 --> 01:18.527
Stop it.

01:18.528 --> 01:20.359
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

01:20.360 --> 01:22.939
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.367
Or time to get out.

01:24.368 --> 01:29.048
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:50.438 --> 01:55.468
Amy and I work on the same case, but
from two separate perspectives.

01:55.469 --> 01:59.302
I dig into the property's past,
bringing its dark secrets to light.

01:59.303 --> 02:01.748
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:01.749 --> 02:06.669
When we're finished, we present our
findings to the clients and each other.

02:06.670 --> 02:09.911
I'm in Egg Harbor, New Jersey,
just outside of Atlantic City.

02:09.912 --> 02:13.250
We were called in by a woman named Jessee.

02:13.251 --> 02:15.518
She tells me her husband,
who's usually a tough guy,

02:15.519 --> 02:18.125
is terrified to go to
certain parts of the house.

02:18.126 --> 02:21.862
Even worse, her three small children
are starting to be affected.

02:21.863 --> 02:26.783
I'm hoping we can help
this young family out.

02:33.238 --> 02:39.138
Before Amy arrives, I need to remove
anything that could influence her findings.

02:39.312 --> 02:45.212
And this house is filled with photos
of a family and their young children.

02:45.902 --> 02:51.802
Once these items are cleared, the location
will be ready for tonight's walk.

03:14.660 --> 03:18.055
I felt, like, this huge...

03:18.056 --> 03:20.756
Being behind me.

03:21.473 --> 03:25.919
And I thought it was a big shadow person.

03:25.920 --> 03:31.200
But when I looked, I knew
that it was just a guy.

03:33.068 --> 03:35.008
And um, he...

03:35.009 --> 03:38.309
Wants to slit my throat.

03:50.385 --> 03:52.226
All right, Jess, so, when we spoke,

03:52.227 --> 03:54.667
you said the whole family's
having issues here.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.891
- Right.
- Tell me about what's going on.

03:56.892 --> 04:00.324
The kids are starting to see things...
shadow figures.

04:00.325 --> 04:03.097
My husband is completely freaked out.

04:03.098 --> 04:04.480
And it's just escalating.

04:04.481 --> 04:06.187
Are you getting affected by anything here?

04:06.188 --> 04:08.433
Yes. I see it more than most.

04:08.434 --> 04:11.082
You do? When you first
moved in, did you start

04:11.083 --> 04:13.089
experiencing stuff, or is
this happening later on?

04:13.090 --> 04:16.112
- It was immediately.
- Why did you guys stay?

04:16.113 --> 04:18.672
We couldn't financially afford to leave.

04:18.673 --> 04:21.449
I had put my life savings into the deposit,

04:21.450 --> 04:23.910
and then we just couldn't go anywhere else.

04:23.911 --> 04:26.185
Now, the kids... how old are they?

04:26.186 --> 04:29.003
- 6, 4, and 2.
- What's going on with them?

04:29.004 --> 04:32.356
My son... he will not go into
his room for any reason.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.008
He doesn't sleep in there, nothing.

04:34.009 --> 04:35.670
- Is he sleeping with you guys?
- Yes.

04:35.671 --> 04:38.349
Okay, does he ever mention why he
doesn't want to stay in his room?

04:38.350 --> 04:41.452
He just says he doesn't like it. Like,
there's just someone in there with him.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.123
What about the other kids?

04:43.124 --> 04:48.838
My daughter... she's been sick for
over two years, and nobody knows why.

04:48.839 --> 04:50.373
Doctors didn't give you a reason?

04:50.374 --> 04:54.797
They tested her from leukemia to
everything, and nothing ever came back...

04:54.798 --> 04:59.015
No ear infection, no, like,
crazy stomach thing, nothing.

04:59.016 --> 05:01.250
It's heartbreaking, and that's
why we called you guys...

05:01.251 --> 05:07.151
Because it's escalated to the point to
where now my kids are being affected.

05:16.072 --> 05:19.672
Uh, there's a sickness here.

05:25.527 --> 05:28.047
Something bad.

05:30.046 --> 05:35.946
If there's gonna be anywhere where
there's a sickness, it would be here.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.027
I don't like it at all.

05:41.505 --> 05:44.206
It's from the stuff...

05:44.207 --> 05:46.307
Outside.

05:47.859 --> 05:51.759
It lingers here. It lingers here.

05:53.449 --> 05:56.799
There's been this thing that has...

05:56.800 --> 05:59.980
Um, always been around.

06:00.809 --> 06:04.229
It's not just this house.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.699
It follows them.

06:10.051 --> 06:12.331
Everywhere.

06:21.371 --> 06:23.248
Three months after we bought the house,

06:23.249 --> 06:27.485
I had a dream that there was
a kid standing in my closet.

06:27.486 --> 06:31.306
I followed him out of the bedroom, through
the living room, into the kitchen.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.093
He stopped at the basement
door, opened the door.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.499
Went like this for me to
follow him, so I did.

06:38.500 --> 06:42.199
I followed him down the first
two steps onto the landing.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.301
I stopped at the landing in my dream.

06:44.302 --> 06:47.274
I watched him walk the rest of the
steps and turn into the basement.

06:47.275 --> 06:48.406
Okay.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.994
I woke up from my dream. I
was standing on the landing.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.184
Like, I physically got out of the bed
and followed this kid in my sleep.

06:55.185 --> 06:57.106
Were you on medication at
the time for anything?

06:57.107 --> 06:58.181
No. Nothing.

06:58.182 --> 06:59.870
- Were you drinking that night?
- No.

06:59.871 --> 07:01.938
There's nothing that would
have made you do that.

07:01.939 --> 07:03.577
Nothing at all.

07:03.578 --> 07:04.957
Anything else in here?

07:04.958 --> 07:07.644
I wake up because I hear people talking.

07:07.645 --> 07:09.409
- They start out in my dream.
- Okay.

07:09.410 --> 07:11.472
And then I wake up, and I still hear them.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.929
So then I'll get up to go
investigate, and there's no one here.

07:14.930 --> 07:16.755
It's got to be tough for
you to sleep in here.

07:16.756 --> 07:17.678
Yes.

07:17.679 --> 07:21.884
And there was a time where, for a
straight year, I slept on the couch.

07:21.885 --> 07:25.725
- That's no way to live.
- No.

07:35.341 --> 07:38.641
What are you looking at?

07:41.823 --> 07:45.417
They kind of look like
little, tiny jellyfishes.

07:45.418 --> 07:48.668
With, like, the long tentacles.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.974
They're on the ceiling.
They're always moving.

07:50.975 --> 07:54.095
They're always around.

07:55.708 --> 07:58.758
They're trying to organize
themselves to become a being.

07:58.759 --> 08:02.178
What sort of things can they do to people?

08:02.179 --> 08:05.179
They are aggravating.

08:05.444 --> 08:10.484
They would cause stress,
a sense of unease uh...

08:11.388 --> 08:13.067
Insomnia.

08:13.068 --> 08:17.328
- Are they dangerous?
- Yes, they are.

08:24.539 --> 08:28.418
This is the most hated room
in the house by everybody.

08:28.419 --> 08:29.990
Okay, so what's going on down here?

08:29.991 --> 08:32.326
My son and I were walking down the stairs.

08:32.327 --> 08:34.693
I turned to him like two
stairs from the bottom,

08:34.695 --> 08:40.134
and right past this doorway, a
very large, very black figure

08:40.135 --> 08:45.965
walked right past the door very slowly,
blacked out the light bulb completely.

08:45.966 --> 08:50.106
Then it kept walking and disappeared.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.979
Nobody else was down here, it
was just you and your son?

08:52.980 --> 08:55.433
- Just me and him.
- The bulb couldn't be faulty...

08:55.434 --> 08:57.618
- Be loose or anything like that?
- No.

08:57.619 --> 08:58.629
Okay, what did you do?

08:58.630 --> 09:01.885
My son immediately turned
around and hauled up

09:01.886 --> 09:03.990
the stairs and went
screaming to his father.

09:03.991 --> 09:08.094
I was immediately, like, freaked
out, and I ran up the steps.

09:08.095 --> 09:13.855
I don't ever like to have my
back to the basement, ever.

09:16.204 --> 09:19.893
This is a thing that's been
following these people forever.

09:19.894 --> 09:24.214
It is mean, and it has bad intentions.

09:24.772 --> 09:28.518
There's some kind of weird
revenge thing going on here.

09:28.519 --> 09:31.451
The man who wanted to slit my
throat will not leave me alone.

09:31.452 --> 09:36.398
I think he hates women and is
furious that I'm in his space.

09:36.399 --> 09:42.299
It just keeps feeling like I'm
getting punched in the stomach.

09:47.269 --> 09:50.108
This guy, he is...

09:50.109 --> 09:53.440
Attached to women and causes
problems in their lives.

09:53.441 --> 09:56.384
- Like what?
- Torments.

09:56.385 --> 10:01.005
Scare them. I think he tries to kill them.

10:14.146 --> 10:17.695
It just keeps feeling like I'm
getting punched in the stomach.

10:17.696 --> 10:22.316
The punching in the stomach is this male...

10:22.373 --> 10:27.233
Who, initially, I thought
was a shadow person.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.712
I got to get away from this guy.

10:36.710 --> 10:38.512
The guy from inside...

10:38.513 --> 10:42.353
He is being kind of belligerent.

10:43.050 --> 10:46.590
It's, like, pounding on me.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.507
It's like, get the [Bleep] out.

10:50.508 --> 10:52.276
Like, get out of here. Get out of here.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.297
Get out of here. Get out of here.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.717
He's, like, totally wiping me.

11:00.718 --> 11:02.619
What do you mean?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.872
Sometimes you meet the ones who really
don't want to talk, and they'll just...

11:05.873 --> 11:07.824
And then you, like, try
to get into their minds,

11:07.825 --> 11:11.190
and then they'll just wipe you,
like it's just this blank slate.

11:11.191 --> 11:13.611
Like there's nothing.

11:13.612 --> 11:17.812
That hasn't happened in a long time.

11:24.942 --> 11:26.810
So Fred, I was talking to your wife, Jess,

11:26.811 --> 11:28.979
and she was telling me what
was going on in the house.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.535
Your daughter having some ailments.

11:31.536 --> 11:34.184
We didn't know what it was. I don't
really talk about it that much.

11:34.185 --> 11:37.241
It was just a rough point in our lives.

11:37.242 --> 11:40.757
One of the other situations is my son.
He never sleeps in his own room.

11:40.758 --> 11:43.621
I don't want him to have a bad
feeling at that young of age.

11:43.622 --> 11:47.431
I mean, that's got to be tough for you as
a father knowing that you can't fix it.

11:47.432 --> 11:49.487
That's why we need your help.

11:49.488 --> 11:53.091
Can you show me some places in the house
where you've been experiencing things?

11:53.092 --> 11:55.372
Absolutely.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.352
We were coming back from a
barbecue, walking up to the house.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.154
We came up on the front porch,

12:10.155 --> 12:12.833
and I seen a shadowy figure
appear through the curtain.

12:12.834 --> 12:13.862
Okay.

12:13.863 --> 12:17.127
I seen the shoulders, the head, the
outline of the whole entire body.

12:17.128 --> 12:20.531
- It scared the living crap out of me.
- Now, you don't look like you scare easy.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.865
But that scared you.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.501
It scared me enough where
I had to call my 4'9 wife

12:24.502 --> 12:26.652
to come up to the front porch
and go inside the house.

12:26.653 --> 12:28.593
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:28.594 --> 12:30.597
Is this the first time you
saw something like that?

12:30.598 --> 12:32.198
No.

12:32.199 --> 12:36.228
In the kitchen, I just happened to see
a shadowy figure, again, peer over.

12:36.229 --> 12:38.375
He's looking at me. I'm looking at him.

12:38.376 --> 12:40.940
I yell at my wife thinking it's
my wife playing a joke on me.

12:40.941 --> 12:43.476
She comes out of the bedroom
looking flustered as could be.

12:43.477 --> 12:46.325
I was like, what are you doing? She's
like, I'm putting the kids to bed.

12:46.326 --> 12:48.014
So you've seen this thing two times.

12:48.015 --> 12:50.284
Actually, two nights ago, I had a dream.

12:50.285 --> 12:54.954
And in that dream, in the corner of the
bedroom, there was a black shadowy figure.

12:54.955 --> 12:56.757
It almost looked like the Grim Reaper.

12:56.758 --> 12:59.859
And it just kind of went for me,
and I woke up at the same time.

12:59.860 --> 13:03.940
I had the chills from head to toe.

13:10.204 --> 13:13.804
Okay, so this guy is pissed.

13:14.055 --> 13:15.999
Pure hatred and anger.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.777
The shadowy figure that wiped my mind
doesn't want me to know anything about him.

13:19.778 --> 13:21.666
But I've been fighting
off his other attempts,

13:21.667 --> 13:25.108
and I'm starting to see
what's making him so angry.

13:25.109 --> 13:29.519
He's mad because he feels like
he was ripped off and betrayed.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.058
And the crawly things in the room...

13:33.059 --> 13:37.282
I know he wants them to be
here, and he wants them to...

13:37.283 --> 13:39.963
Come together and form a being.

13:39.964 --> 13:42.400
Are you talking about the
jellyfish creatures?

13:42.401 --> 13:44.001
Yes.

13:44.002 --> 13:48.739
Sometimes I gather information that's so
bizarre I can hardly believe it myself.

13:48.740 --> 13:53.842
But I just have to rely on what I see and
feel and hope it'll make sense later.

13:53.843 --> 13:57.074
And they're not good, these things.

13:57.075 --> 13:58.890
They're not.

13:58.891 --> 14:01.171
He's not.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.299
How you feeling that you're here?

14:10.300 --> 14:13.536
I just want to get out. I just want to
leave, I just don't like being down here.

14:13.537 --> 14:17.654
There's always a feeling of somebody
just behind you looking at you.

14:17.655 --> 14:19.926
You have that feeling you're being watched.

14:19.927 --> 14:23.153
Talking to your wife about the basement.
She talked about the incident between...

14:23.154 --> 14:25.113
Her and your son, what they saw down here.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.386
I really didn't, you know,
believe it at the time.

14:28.387 --> 14:31.070
I don't know, but until I actually
physically had to come down here,

14:31.071 --> 14:32.788
then I could understand.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.891
Plus it bothers me that
my son has to go through

14:35.892 --> 14:38.194
- what we're going through as grown adults.
- Right.

14:38.195 --> 14:41.907
I want him to have a childhood and be a
child, I don't want him to worry about...

14:41.908 --> 14:44.708
Is there something in his bedroom?
Is there something in this basement?

14:44.709 --> 14:46.946
You know what? Let's get out
of here, you've been...

14:46.947 --> 14:51.507
Nice enough to come down. I appreciate it.

14:53.018 --> 14:56.498
I think this is his space.

14:56.615 --> 14:59.009
Oh, that [Bleep] will not
come and talk to me.

14:59.010 --> 15:01.211
He's a [Bleep] coward.

15:01.212 --> 15:03.792
Such a coward.

15:04.550 --> 15:08.052
But he's big, and he is
powerful, so it's weird.

15:08.053 --> 15:12.122
Like, he's such a [Bleep] baby. Like,
he won't talk to me or anything.

15:12.123 --> 15:15.963
He wants to be brutal about it.

15:18.463 --> 15:22.966
I think he's very capable of
inflicting pain on people.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.368
He can touch and, you know,

15:24.369 --> 15:27.738
physically do anything he wants
to a person, pretty much.

15:27.739 --> 15:31.097
Do you have any idea why,
exactly, he's doing this?

15:31.098 --> 15:36.438
Mm, because he made a
commitment to uh, wreak havoc.

15:36.495 --> 15:38.785
So he just wants to [Bleep] kill.

15:38.786 --> 15:43.886
And I think he wants to
do it to somebody here.

16:01.807 --> 16:04.551
I made some calls, and I was
able to track down a woman

16:04.552 --> 16:07.421
who used to own the
property I'm investigating.

16:07.422 --> 16:10.116
She told me that she grew up
in Fred and Jessee's house,

16:10.117 --> 16:16.017
but that her time there was
marked with violence and tragedy.

16:19.901 --> 16:23.569
So, Linda, I understand you grew
up in the house I'm investigating.

16:23.570 --> 16:28.542
Yes. It was my mother and my father
and my brother, Louis, and myself.

16:28.543 --> 16:29.743
Okay.

16:29.744 --> 16:32.440
Now, you had mentioned on the
phone there was some tragedy

16:32.441 --> 16:34.943
at home when you were living
there, what happened?

16:34.944 --> 16:39.864
My brother had died. I
have a picture of him.

16:41.689 --> 16:46.060
He had committed suicide.
He had hung himself...

16:46.061 --> 16:48.070
- In the basement.
- In the house?

16:48.071 --> 16:50.283
- Yes.
- Aw, geez.

16:50.284 --> 16:53.697
- How old was he?
- Fourteen.

16:53.698 --> 16:56.158
It was 1970.

16:56.564 --> 16:57.571
Who found him?

16:57.572 --> 17:02.652
My mother went down the basement,
and she found him there.

17:02.653 --> 17:07.279
And she yelled and asked me
to bring a knife down...

17:07.280 --> 17:09.250
Because she had to cut him down.

17:09.251 --> 17:10.646
Oh, geez.

17:10.647 --> 17:13.727
- Did he ever mention any problems to you?
- No.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.358
He was a good kid. He never got
in any trouble or anything.

17:17.358 --> 17:19.385
Okay now, did your parents stay there?

17:19.386 --> 17:25.146
Yeah, but in '92, my mother
died of a rare blood disease.

17:27.204 --> 17:31.284
How did your father deal with that?

17:32.091 --> 17:35.721
I lost him the day my mother died.

17:35.722 --> 17:39.802
After that, everything went downhill.

17:40.882 --> 17:46.036
He said he was hearing voices and
there was people in his house.

17:46.037 --> 17:49.817
He was diagnosed with psychosis.

17:51.923 --> 17:54.994
- When your father died, how old was he?
- 87.

17:54.995 --> 17:56.518
- 87.
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.519 --> 18:00.414
He was like an empty shell. That's
how I always described him.

18:00.415 --> 18:03.495
He was there physically, but
the man I knew he just...

18:03.496 --> 18:06.256
He wasn't there.

18:10.846 --> 18:16.486
There is, like, this old man
that's bopping around, too.

18:18.585 --> 18:23.604
I think this old man is,
like, in his death state.

18:23.605 --> 18:26.845
And he wanders mostly...

18:30.251 --> 18:32.641
Uh, he's confused.

18:32.642 --> 18:36.002
He's old. He's like 80.

18:36.109 --> 18:37.404
Okay.

18:37.405 --> 18:40.930
He does have moments of clarity where...

18:40.931 --> 18:44.951
He knows that there's people here.

18:45.712 --> 18:49.264
But then he gets even more confused.

18:49.265 --> 18:55.165
There is activity in the closet because
he goes in there and he shrinks down.

18:58.758 --> 19:04.398
They look all cute and harmless,
and then they're crazy.

19:07.901 --> 19:11.265
Now that I've got a pretty good idea
about this home's recent history,

19:11.266 --> 19:13.724
I need to find out a little
bit more about its past.

19:13.725 --> 19:17.684
So I've reached out to a local genealogist
to look through the archives.

19:17.685 --> 19:23.585
He tells me he's come up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

19:30.069 --> 19:33.981
Bob, what were you able to find out
about the property I'm investigating?

19:33.982 --> 19:38.030
I was able to take the title
back to the mid-1850s.

19:38.031 --> 19:41.374
When a group of wealthy
German financiers...

19:41.375 --> 19:44.401
Acquired 38,000 acres of land.

19:44.402 --> 19:47.260
And wanted to develop a
town that would be a

19:47.261 --> 19:50.209
land of opportunity for the
German immigrants to come.

19:50.210 --> 19:53.532
All right, so, who wound up settling
on the land that I'm investigating?

19:53.533 --> 19:54.688
Do you know that?

19:54.689 --> 19:57.393
There were two brothers,
Ignatz and Louis Roesch.

19:57.394 --> 20:02.380
They were German immigrants who came over
here expecting the land of opportunity.

20:02.381 --> 20:06.716
There was gonna be parks,
lakes, churches, schools...

20:06.717 --> 20:11.233
I mean, a whole town that they could
come to and raise a family in.

20:11.234 --> 20:13.257
Okay, so what did they
find when they got here?

20:13.258 --> 20:17.004
A little stark reality. I think
it was woods and mosquitoes.

20:17.005 --> 20:20.398
They were met with very
difficult conditions.

20:20.399 --> 20:25.286
Louis had a total of six
children, three of which died.

20:25.287 --> 20:28.106
One of them was an infant.

20:28.107 --> 20:31.643
Louis, died 9 years old
by double pneumonia.

20:31.644 --> 20:35.842
And then a son, William, died
when he was 26 of enteritis.

20:35.843 --> 20:40.587
And I brought the death
certificate of William there.

20:40.588 --> 20:44.507
If they would have had the hospitals
and the proper medical attention,

20:44.508 --> 20:46.558
they could have done something different.

20:46.559 --> 20:48.949
- Sounds like he got screwed over.
- Yes.

20:48.950 --> 20:53.848
Can't imagine this is the life he dreamt
of when he left his home country.

20:53.849 --> 20:55.769
Okay.

20:58.594 --> 21:02.534
This man, who I thought
was a shadow person...

21:02.535 --> 21:07.995
He's, like, hiding. And he
doesn't want to come out.

21:08.346 --> 21:12.889
He's not talking to me, and this
is all coming from his mind.

21:12.890 --> 21:15.258
I'm determined to get into
this dead man's head.

21:15.259 --> 21:18.520
He's so violent and unpredictable
that I think he's responsible

21:18.521 --> 21:22.351
for whatever the people in
this house are going through.

21:22.352 --> 21:26.360
There was something with money
and him and even his family.

21:26.361 --> 21:29.742
I don't know. Like, something from...

21:29.743 --> 21:31.702
A long time ago.

21:31.703 --> 21:34.334
Do you have any idea when this was?

21:34.335 --> 21:36.392
Probably, like, 1850s.

21:36.393 --> 21:38.890
I don't even know if it's
in this freaking country.

21:38.891 --> 21:42.431
He felt betrayed, he felt...

21:43.109 --> 21:45.689
Double-crossed.

21:53.205 --> 21:56.265
Why would he haunt...

21:56.816 --> 21:59.964
And be trying to get revenge?

21:59.965 --> 22:04.285
They're cursed, really. They're cursed.

22:08.987 --> 22:10.847
Yes.

22:24.768 --> 22:26.908
I'm at the library to see if I can find

22:26.909 --> 22:31.699
anything more about Fred
and Jessee's property.

22:31.700 --> 22:37.600
I don't get any direct hits, but
one article catches my attention.

22:38.573 --> 22:44.217
Turns out there used to be a
sanitarium right near their house.

22:44.218 --> 22:47.086
But the records about what
went on there are limited.

22:47.087 --> 22:48.755
So I've reached out to a local historian.

22:48.756 --> 22:50.738
He tells me that the sanitarium

22:50.739 --> 22:56.619
is one of the most amazing
stories in Egg Harbor's history.

23:00.301 --> 23:02.436
During my research, I came
across this sanitarium

23:02.437 --> 23:04.705
that was right near the
property I'm investigating.

23:04.706 --> 23:06.622
What can you tell me about this place?

23:06.623 --> 23:11.536
Well, Steve, we had a place here that was
called the Neutral Water Health Spa.

23:11.537 --> 23:17.437
That was centered on the healing
waters of the creek behind us.

23:17.851 --> 23:20.742
It was cedar water that
comes up from the ground.

23:20.743 --> 23:23.423
It was advertised in several publications,

23:23.424 --> 23:26.159
and people that had all kinds
of ailments would come here,

23:26.160 --> 23:29.780
and walk in the health waters.

23:29.781 --> 23:33.266
They heard that all the
wonderful cures you can get.

23:33.267 --> 23:37.493
What kind of ailments did these people
have that they would go in the water?

23:37.494 --> 23:42.968
Prostate problems, kidney problems,
uterine problems, infertility.

23:42.969 --> 23:46.058
- Okay.
- You name it, they came here for it.

23:46.059 --> 23:48.256
So there were a lot of sick
people on these grounds?

23:48.257 --> 23:52.020
- Yes, basically.
- Do we know if anybody died in this place?

23:52.021 --> 23:54.697
Well, we do have a reference
to one person who came here

23:54.698 --> 23:57.707
that the doctors in the area thought
he was at death's doorstep.

23:57.708 --> 24:00.368
And thought he shouldn't be
accepted, but they took him in.

24:00.369 --> 24:04.869
But we have no reference of how he died.

24:06.428 --> 24:07.356
Whoa.

24:07.357 --> 24:13.117
So there's a lot of people
that are walking through here.

24:16.094 --> 24:20.054
Woo. Lots of illness here. [Bleep]

24:21.265 --> 24:25.225
A lot of people who are vomiting.

24:25.389 --> 24:28.195
Something with preservation, maybe.

24:28.196 --> 24:32.166
Somebody's dying that has
something to do with this...

24:32.167 --> 24:33.689
Group.

24:33.690 --> 24:37.519
I feel really sick out here. I
feel really out of it out here.

24:37.520 --> 24:41.480
I feel, like, lightheaded, dizzy...

24:41.530 --> 24:43.959
Hot, dehydrated, chest pain.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.200
I can't see very well.

24:55.156 --> 24:57.460
Who ran this place? I mean,
was it a state place?

24:57.461 --> 25:01.345
No, it was a private entity that was
incorporated here in Egg Harbor City.

25:01.346 --> 25:04.168
And it was run by a Dr. Charles Smith.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.919
What kind of guy was he?

25:05.920 --> 25:08.626
He was a very charismatic
person, eccentric.

25:08.627 --> 25:11.804
He wholeheartedly believed
in his "fountain of youth".

25:11.805 --> 25:13.893
Was he a legit doctor?
Did he have a degree?

25:13.894 --> 25:15.063
No he didn't have a degree,

25:15.064 --> 25:18.555
and there's nothing on record with
The State Department of Health.

25:18.556 --> 25:21.741
He once said that he was born in 1776,

25:21.742 --> 25:26.539
which would have made him well
over 140 years old when he died.

25:26.540 --> 25:30.088
Any given time, the
Neutral Water Health Spa,

25:30.089 --> 25:32.951
was pretty loaded with
about 100-and-some people.

25:32.952 --> 25:35.811
So he made a good living doing this.

25:35.812 --> 25:37.229
Basically, yeah.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.967
He was quite well-to-do at the end

25:39.968 --> 25:43.602
because just to build this
facility and this house

25:43.603 --> 25:49.423
and everything else that he had
took quite a bit of money.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.886
There is a structure.

25:53.887 --> 25:56.856
I'm getting, like, the people
who had to organize it.

25:56.857 --> 25:59.977
Maybe doctors, maybe...

26:00.291 --> 26:04.119
People that had to put this together.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.978
And there's a dead person here.
I don't like him.

26:08.979 --> 26:12.271
And there's a lot of money around him.

26:12.272 --> 26:16.112
He's very, very sick physically.

26:16.506 --> 26:20.106
And mentally, he's disturbed.

26:29.481 --> 26:31.931
During my walk, I
encountered many entities,

26:31.932 --> 26:36.989
so I had a sketch artist draw
the two who stood out clearly.

26:36.990 --> 26:39.596
First, the old man in the house.

26:39.597 --> 26:44.937
He's probably about 80, very
sick, very, very frail.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.660
How would you describe
the shape of the head?

26:47.661 --> 26:51.924
Fairly round, but then it
does kind of come down...

26:51.925 --> 26:54.865
To a sharper point.

26:55.574 --> 26:59.978
Next, I describe the bizarre
creatures in the Master Bedroom.

26:59.979 --> 27:02.663
These little things...

27:02.664 --> 27:06.348
That kind of resemble a jellyfish.

27:06.349 --> 27:12.249
This is kind of flipped, and then
the tentacles are coming out.

27:14.341 --> 27:17.821
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:18.764 --> 27:20.624
Yes.

27:41.090 --> 27:43.694
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:43.695 --> 27:48.499
we're going to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.824
This is Fred and Jessee.

27:49.825 --> 27:51.258
- Hi.
- Hi. Hello.

27:51.259 --> 27:55.640
They're married. They've been living in
this house a little bit over eight years.

27:55.641 --> 27:58.949
They've been having experiences
ever since they moved in.

27:58.950 --> 28:03.017
But lately, things have
gotten really out of hand.

28:03.018 --> 28:05.283
What's most disturbing is they
got three small children,

28:05.284 --> 28:09.277
and two of them are starting
to have experiences.

28:09.278 --> 28:11.189
That being said, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

28:11.190 --> 28:16.590
and she can explain what she
encountered on her walk.

28:20.630 --> 28:25.300
The first thing that I got was I was
actually pulled to the backyard.

28:25.301 --> 28:30.581
I saw a lot of people there
and a lot of illness.

28:30.693 --> 28:33.632
These individuals were involved with...

28:33.633 --> 28:37.173
Trying to preserve something.

28:37.233 --> 28:41.895
And I saw the people who were trying
to organize this were doctors,

28:41.896 --> 28:44.370
but they couldn't make it work.

28:44.371 --> 28:48.973
Then I saw this one man
standing out, and he...

28:48.974 --> 28:52.334
Was severely mentally ill.

28:53.750 --> 28:59.217
Well, there was this sanitarium
less than a mile from here.

28:59.218 --> 29:03.478
This is the picture of the sanitarium.

29:03.739 --> 29:06.121
This is in the late 1800s.

29:06.122 --> 29:10.993
This guy, Dr. Smith, claimed that he
discovered the fountain of youth.

29:10.994 --> 29:13.996
At any given time, he had over
100 people in this place.

29:13.997 --> 29:16.736
These people were sick that went there.

29:16.737 --> 29:19.267
What they were trying to
preserve was their youth.

29:19.268 --> 29:22.824
- Was he a real doctor?
- No, but you said he was crazy.

29:22.825 --> 29:26.702
He told somebody during a census
that he was 147 years old.

29:26.703 --> 29:32.103
I mean, do you think this
is what you picked up on?

29:32.248 --> 29:34.108
Yes.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.019
What else did you see?

29:37.020 --> 29:40.654
When I walked in the house, I felt like...

29:40.655 --> 29:44.846
The illnesses were a little
bit in the living room.

29:44.847 --> 29:48.488
Then when I went in the
pink room, I felt it...

29:48.489 --> 29:51.129
Really strongly.

29:52.211 --> 29:57.131
And I feel like it's
coming from the outside.

29:58.555 --> 30:00.803
That's my daughter's room.

30:00.804 --> 30:04.884
She's been sick for two years now.

30:05.461 --> 30:07.669
And they just couldn't find
anything wrong with her.

30:07.670 --> 30:12.713
They tested her from everything from cancer
to, like, anything that you can think of.

30:12.714 --> 30:15.772
And then six, eight months ago,
she got her appendix taken out.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.013
Oh, my gosh.

30:17.014 --> 30:19.844
We actually had a nurse that
was a nurse for 20 years,

30:19.845 --> 30:24.355
say that she's never seen a 3-year-old
get her appendix taken out.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.996
It's not fair.

30:29.348 --> 30:31.320
What else did you see?

30:31.321 --> 30:35.758
I saw an old man in the house.
And he's in his death state.

30:35.759 --> 30:39.971
He's just, like, confused, and
he's about 80, really little guy.

30:39.972 --> 30:45.552
His favorite spot is in the
closet in the back bedroom.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.825
He hides in there.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.167
Wow.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.411
That's my son's room.

30:58.412 --> 31:02.869
He's 6. He's never slept
a full night in his bed.

31:02.870 --> 31:07.130
It validates everything he says to me.

31:07.221 --> 31:09.758
Well, there was a guy that
lived here for 51 years.

31:09.759 --> 31:13.675
His name was Louis Brunk.
He died at the age of 87.

31:13.676 --> 31:16.407
I actually spoke to his
daughter, who grew up here.

31:16.408 --> 31:21.042
At the end, he psychologically wasn't
right, and he would talk to his daughter

31:21.043 --> 31:24.720
and say, there's people here, they're
bothering me, they're talking to me.

31:24.721 --> 31:26.873
This is the guy.

31:26.874 --> 31:32.514
And actually, that's his
daughter in the photo with him.

31:34.517 --> 31:40.417
I did a sketch of a man I think
you're going to want to see.

31:44.912 --> 31:47.732
You guys tell me.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.870
Wow.

31:59.259 --> 32:01.779
That's crazy.

32:02.385 --> 32:04.130
I think it's him.

32:04.131 --> 32:07.666
I think it's too close to
dismiss it to be anyone else.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.947
It's him.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.939
When I got here, behind me...

32:16.940 --> 32:21.911
Was what I initially thought
was a shadow person...

32:21.912 --> 32:24.083
Huge, though. Huge.

32:24.084 --> 32:27.554
And then I realized, as he
was walking up behind me,

32:27.555 --> 32:30.522
that it was just a male who was hiding.

32:30.523 --> 32:34.954
His two favorite places are
the basement and the garage.

32:34.955 --> 32:38.763
This guy is very capable
of inflicting pain.

32:38.764 --> 32:41.829
He was very threatened by me being here.

32:41.830 --> 32:45.238
Like, right away, we're out here, and
he comes in, and he's flipping out.

32:45.239 --> 32:48.848
He's, like, pounding on me.
He's like, get the [Bleep] out.

32:48.849 --> 32:50.964
Get out of here. Get out of here.

32:50.965 --> 32:54.954
His goal is to try to screw up...

32:54.955 --> 32:57.295
Your lives.

32:57.744 --> 33:02.530
Now, Jessee had an experience with a
shadow thing down in the basement.

33:02.531 --> 33:04.791
- Right.
- Would you explain that to Amy?

33:04.792 --> 33:07.259
I was walking down the steps with my son.

33:07.260 --> 33:10.126
I get to the bottom step and I turn to him

33:10.127 --> 33:12.971
and right in front of
the light, very slowly,

33:12.972 --> 33:17.603
this large, like, floor-to-ceiling black
mass walked in front of the light.

33:17.604 --> 33:21.252
And it stopped for a good
three to four seconds.

33:21.253 --> 33:24.638
And then it, like, just dissipated.

33:24.639 --> 33:27.613
Coming up on the porch one
time, there was a shadow.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.315
It looked at me. I looked at him.

33:29.316 --> 33:31.666
And the other time, I mean,
I was sitting on the couch,

33:31.667 --> 33:34.110
and she was putting the kids to bed.

33:34.111 --> 33:36.127
Same thing.

33:36.128 --> 33:39.424
The back story that I
was able to get on him.

33:39.425 --> 33:43.347
Was that he's from like 100, 200 years ago.

33:43.348 --> 33:47.906
He was from another country, and he felt...

33:47.907 --> 33:51.070
Like he had been double-crossed.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.704
Something to do with land and money.

33:53.705 --> 33:57.545
And he became extremely vengeful.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.412
Amy, let me tell you about
this guy Louis Roesch.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.815
He came here from Germany
back in the 1860s.

34:02.816 --> 34:04.775
Came here with his wife and his brother.

34:04.776 --> 34:08.687
They settled in Egg Harbor, right under
the land that your house sits on.

34:08.688 --> 34:14.193
Supposedly, this place was gonna have
schools, churches, theaters, hospitals.

34:14.194 --> 34:17.295
They buy it, they come here,
they look at their land...

34:17.297 --> 34:20.431
There's none of that. All they
got are trees and mosquitoes.

34:20.433 --> 34:25.204
Basically, he was betrayed by the
people he gave his money to.

34:25.205 --> 34:29.487
He also had a lot of tragedy. Out of
his six kids, three of them died.

34:29.487 --> 34:35.248
The youngest was a little girl.
She died from appendicitis.

34:35.386 --> 34:39.375
He had a 9-year-old they
said died from a cold.

34:39.376 --> 34:43.065
He had a 26-year-old son
that died from enteritis.

34:43.065 --> 34:48.966
Had they been in a developed area, these
kids probably wouldn't have died.

34:50.217 --> 34:53.831
The next thing that I encountered was
when I went into the Master Bedroom.

34:53.833 --> 34:59.533
And what I saw in there was
these things on the ceiling.

35:00.207 --> 35:02.851
And they had, like, little tentacles.

35:02.852 --> 35:07.472
And they become very, very active at night.

35:08.648 --> 35:10.736
One of the main things... they don't sleep.

35:10.737 --> 35:12.484
- Ever.
- Ever.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.905
- For eight years?
- Yeah.

35:16.314 --> 35:18.057
You had a sleepwalking incident.

35:18.058 --> 35:19.702
- I did.
- Really?

35:19.703 --> 35:23.055
Three months after we first
moved into the house.

35:23.056 --> 35:27.243
In my dream, I had woken up, and there
was a kid standing in my closet.

35:27.244 --> 35:30.187
I followed him out, and he
stopped at the basement door.

35:30.188 --> 35:33.072
He walked down the steps,
stopped at the landing.

35:33.073 --> 35:35.503
I stopped on the landing, and I woke up.

35:35.504 --> 35:38.613
And when I woke up, I was
standing on the landing.

35:38.614 --> 35:41.332
And then I called Fred, hysterical.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.029
Something's got to give.

35:43.030 --> 35:46.514
Amy, do you know what those
things on the ceilings are?

35:46.515 --> 35:50.770
They're shattered aspects of the
people who lived and died here.

35:50.771 --> 35:53.157
It's kind of hard to visualize
what I'm talking about,

35:53.158 --> 35:57.118
so the sketch artist did draw it.

36:01.640 --> 36:06.080
That's interesting. Take a look at that.

36:09.112 --> 36:11.512
Oh, my God.

36:28.325 --> 36:31.101
Do you know what those
things on the ceilings are?

36:31.102 --> 36:35.373
They're shattered aspects of the
people who lived and died here.

36:35.374 --> 36:37.596
It's kind of hard to visualize
what I'm talking about,

36:37.597 --> 36:41.557
so the sketch artist did draw it.

36:46.252 --> 36:50.692
That's interesting. Take a look at that.

36:53.866 --> 36:56.266
Oh, my God.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.890
Does it remind you of a dream you had?

37:05.891 --> 37:08.059
That's exactly where it was. Right there.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.561
Identical. That whole shape.

37:10.562 --> 37:14.455
Absolutely. To the "T".
That's how I felt afterwards.

37:14.456 --> 37:16.834
Exact placement.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.709
What's going on is that...

37:19.710 --> 37:24.030
This guy Louis wants these things to...

37:25.826 --> 37:31.226
Become an entity so he can
do very, very bad things.

37:31.467 --> 37:34.384
This Louis or the one from Germany?

37:34.385 --> 37:38.188
The one from Germany... the bad Louis.

37:38.189 --> 37:41.008
Honestly, I don't even
know what to do with this.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.129
His goal is vengeance.

37:44.335 --> 37:46.760
Because he felt double-crossed.

37:46.761 --> 37:51.921
And what he did was he
actually cursed this land.

37:52.306 --> 37:57.395
But when he did this curse,
he actually cursed himself.

37:57.396 --> 38:00.959
So he's, like, in this forever.
He can't get out.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.407
But since he can't get out,
he's gonna continue to do this,

38:04.408 --> 38:09.313
to create problems or illness or
misery or whatever he can do.

38:09.314 --> 38:12.056
Your sleepwalking incident...

38:12.057 --> 38:16.557
Probably him, probably trying to kill you.

38:18.414 --> 38:20.665
Is that why he's always checking up on me?

38:20.666 --> 38:23.906
He's threatened by you.

38:24.126 --> 38:28.147
If he's able to ever get these things...

38:28.148 --> 38:29.984
Together.

38:29.985 --> 38:32.873
- What could happen?
- He'd get more powerful.

38:32.874 --> 38:38.774
He would be able to control them
and also feed off of their energy.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.518
- Was there anything else?
- No.

38:41.519 --> 38:46.799
Well, remember before, I
told you about Louis Brunk?

38:47.392 --> 38:50.994
His 14-year-old son hung
himself in the basement here.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.915
Okay.

38:54.894 --> 38:59.214
Nobody knows why. Talked to his sister.

38:59.541 --> 39:02.801
Why do you think you think you
didn't get the hanging downstairs?

39:02.802 --> 39:04.719
It could be several things.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.278
He could just be gone, or
he could be scattered.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.643
- Do you have a picture?
- Of him?

39:10.644 --> 39:13.824
- Of the son.
- I do.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.488
Oh, my God.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.572
That's who I saw in my dream.

39:32.477 --> 39:35.206
I don't think his son was a bad person,

39:35.207 --> 39:38.646
so I don't think he would lead
you down a flight of stairs.

39:38.647 --> 39:42.096
It could be that he was
influenced by this guy, Louis.

39:42.097 --> 39:44.977
Which is not good.

39:49.829 --> 39:53.502
Jessee, Fred, you got hit with
a lot of information tonight.

39:53.503 --> 39:56.653
And I'm sure some of it's not
what you wanted to hear.

39:56.654 --> 40:01.404
The pressing question is, is it safe for
you to raise your children in this house?

40:01.405 --> 40:03.467
For that question, I'm gonna
turn that over to Amy,

40:03.468 --> 40:08.268
and hopefully she'll
have an answer for you.

40:10.980 --> 40:16.260
You have a lot of dead
around this location, but...

40:16.517 --> 40:21.515
It's really beneficial for you
and the dead that are here...

40:21.516 --> 40:24.805
If you stay and stop the vicious cycle.

40:24.806 --> 40:29.486
What I feel needs to be done here is to...

40:29.973 --> 40:33.153
Contact a local Wiccan.

40:33.154 --> 40:34.832
What exactly is a Wiccan?

40:34.833 --> 40:37.742
Wiccans are, like, a natural witch.

40:37.743 --> 40:40.286
They are all about the Earth,
they are all about nature,

40:40.287 --> 40:45.414
they're all about preservation,
and she or he is going to...

40:45.415 --> 40:51.172
Do some kind of ritual that will negate the
curse that he has placed upon himself.

40:51.173 --> 40:55.853
Will the Wiccan take care of the bad Louis?

40:56.067 --> 41:00.402
Uh, this fractured stuff, and possibly...

41:00.403 --> 41:03.452
- Our poor guy here?
- Yes.

41:03.453 --> 41:07.460
And it'll protect them from his...

41:07.461 --> 41:09.345
Vengeful curse.

41:09.346 --> 41:12.903
Will that take care of this sickness
that's outside trying to get in?

41:12.904 --> 41:15.652
Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.

41:15.653 --> 41:18.837
I would love to help him to be with him.

41:18.838 --> 41:22.313
And even this guy... I would
like him to go with his family.

41:22.314 --> 41:27.307
Just let us go and just
do what we have to do.

41:27.308 --> 41:29.290
Are you gonna take her advice?

41:29.291 --> 41:31.301
- I'm gonna call tomorrow.
- Okay.

41:31.302 --> 41:35.025
What I had to go through, in
myself, which nobody knows...

41:35.026 --> 41:40.926
Other than her, maybe my parents, is
what my daughter's sickness did to me.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.133
I need to do it for her.

41:43.134 --> 41:48.594
It's gonna be taken care
of by the end of the week.

41:52.551 --> 41:55.054
I'm worried that if they don't
deal with it immediately,

41:55.055 --> 42:00.230
their suffering could continue, and they
might never find peace in their home.
