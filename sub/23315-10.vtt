WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:11.133 --> 00:12.533
I am so fucking angry.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.533
Stop, stop, stop!

00:14.600 --> 00:17.700
I'm sorry for last night.
I just want to continue as we
were.

00:17.767 --> 00:21.467
Sam has admitted he's in the
wrong.
Shame, shame, shame!

00:21.533 --> 00:23.300
I am not a bad person!

00:23.367 --> 00:26.100
Mornin', you bunch of piss
heads!
Marnie's back!

00:27.800 --> 00:31.767
I want a cuddle. Me boyfriend's
not here. Does that really
matter?

00:36.333 --> 00:39.000
That what I thought
Abbie told us this afternoon.

00:40.267 --> 00:43.300
What the fuck?
Has Steph actually just pushed
us?

00:47.867 --> 00:50.267
I don't care.
I'm not going to kick off

00:50.333 --> 00:52.033
cos I 100 percent trust Sam now,

00:52.100 --> 00:54.167
and no-one is going
to get in the way.

00:55.967 --> 00:58.533
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.533
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.367
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:04.433 --> 01:06.333
I'm preened to perfection.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.667
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:08.733 --> 01:11.367
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.133
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.300
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:35.867 --> 01:37.633
(Abbie) Mornin'.
Mornin'.

01:37.700 --> 01:39.967
(groans)
Hungover?

01:41.333 --> 01:45.167
I've woke up and there's only
me,
Abbie and Marnie in the room.

01:45.233 --> 01:47.567
Steph must have really fell out
with Abbie.

01:47.633 --> 01:49.367
What happened with Steph?

01:49.433 --> 01:51.400
Chloe came over to me
and she was like,

01:51.467 --> 01:54.600
"Steph's told me that you said
that you don't trust Sam."

01:54.667 --> 01:58.600
I said, "Where's that come
from?"
I've never said that at all.

01:58.667 --> 02:02.500
Me and Chloe have been through a
lot
and put all the drama behind us,

02:02.567 --> 02:05.733
but then Steph has to go meddle
and shit stir everything up.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.699
Steph pushed us.
Really? She got that angry?
Yeah.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.967
Whatever went on with Abbie
and Steph,

02:11.032 --> 02:14.867
it's our last day in the house,
so they need to sort it out.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.667
Right, you need to talk to
Steph.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.533
Was there a kick-off last night?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.567
Well, there was
a lot of gin involved,

02:23.633 --> 02:26.967
but I just know she was kicking
off
and I could feel her...

02:27.033 --> 02:31.400
She was getting me a bit angry.
I mean, I am a bit pissed off.

02:31.467 --> 02:33.833
Did she say,
"I hope Sam doesn't hurt her"

02:33.900 --> 02:36.067
or "I think Sam's gonna hurt
her",

02:36.133 --> 02:39.233
cos then that's what
could be getting mixed up, yeah?

02:39.300 --> 02:41.533
I'll have to speak to her
today about it.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.867
Sort it out properly
while we're sober.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.033
Things got heated in the club
last night

02:46.100 --> 02:48.600
and it doesn't show
any signs of stopping,

02:48.667 --> 02:51.100
so breakfast is gonna be
fucking awkward.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.700
(Chloe) Morning.

02:54.767 --> 02:57.867
It's so amazing, waking up to
Sam
every single morning.

02:57.933 --> 03:02.367
He's like the woof to my dog,
the cup
to my tea, the lip to my gloss.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.367
I just don't want this time to
end.

03:04.433 --> 03:06.600
I had such a good night
in Middlesbrough.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.700
I told you, it's fucking mint.

03:08.767 --> 03:10.867
Do you remember what you said to
me?
No.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.200
You kept on
calling me your boyfriend.

03:13.267 --> 03:17.533
(laughs) Goodnight. Bye.
It's morning.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.767
I know that me and you
are not boyfriend and
girlfriend.

03:20.833 --> 03:24.200
Sam has noticed that
I kept calling him my boyfriend.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.500
I wish he forgot.
I'm so embarrassed.

03:26.567 --> 03:30.167
That thing got said to us by
Steph.
Brings back stuff up, doesn't
it?

03:30.233 --> 03:32.200
I don't wanna keep going in
circles.

03:32.267 --> 03:35.133
I understand that.
That's why I sort of lost me
head.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.067
I think Chloe finally trusts me.
I
never thought I'd get to this
point.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.267
You could have went mad
and you haven't.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.100
I know, cos I'm tryin' to
impress.
Impress who?

03:45.267 --> 03:48.633
Hmm, I wonder who it is.
Tall, skinny, brown hair, blue
eyes.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.533
Why do you keep saying "skinny"?

03:50.600 --> 03:54.033
Every morning we wake up,
you say "skinny". It's
"athletic".

03:57.667 --> 04:00.700
I'm so hungover, you know.
Think this is the worst...

04:00.767 --> 04:02.833
Yous do not handle hangovers
very well.

04:02.900 --> 04:06.267
Good morning!
There's the happy couple.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.400
I don't even believe this,
but I'm sick of shagging. Why?

04:09.467 --> 04:12.100
Me fanny's hurting.
Good morning, girls!

04:12.167 --> 04:15.233
This is the first time
Steph and Abbie have seen each
other

04:15.300 --> 04:17.100
since the kick off last night.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.466
Round two.

04:19.533 --> 04:22.033
This is awkward.
Extremely.

04:22.100 --> 04:24.833
Everyone is feeling awkward
about last night

04:24.900 --> 04:26.567
and I'm feeling really shit.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.467
I think yous girls need to talk.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.067
Go on, fucking have it out.

04:30.133 --> 04:34.200
What did I apparently say?
That Abbie said that Sam's a
player.

04:34.267 --> 04:35.633
As soon as Steph came in,

04:35.700 --> 04:38.333
I made sure
she never felt left out,

04:38.400 --> 04:40.367
and this is how she repays us.

04:40.433 --> 04:42.567
What I've said
when I've had a drink,

04:42.633 --> 04:44.833
maybe that's what
I thought you meant.

04:44.900 --> 04:47.433
Sometimes it's really hard
to read Abbie.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.433
I don't know how she's thinking,

04:49.500 --> 04:52.833
so if I did get it wrong
it would have been a honest
mistake.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.000
I was made out to say something
that was totally wrong,

04:56.067 --> 04:59.433
and then I got pushed,
in my hometown.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.900
I'm getting pushed by someone
who's
meant to be one of me good
mates.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.833
It is coming to the end and I
don't
want to leave things on bad
terms.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.167
Steph is gonna have
to apologise first.

05:10.233 --> 05:13.600
I'm holding me hands.
I'm in the wrong. I'm really
sorry.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.800
I really regret fighting with
Abbie.

05:15.867 --> 05:19.600
I just want it all sorted and
for me
and Abbie to be friends again.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.800
But you know, like, you're me
girl.
I love you to bits.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.067
Fair play to Steph for
apologising,

05:25.133 --> 05:28.233
but truthfully, Steph,
you shouldn't have got involved.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.367
I have to go to the gym.
I'm hanging.

05:30.433 --> 05:33.067
Is that a joke? No.
Can I go with you?

05:33.133 --> 05:36.967
Me and Sam need to get to
the gym and sweat this hangover
out.

05:37.033 --> 05:40.733
If I do accidentally drop you
or knock you out, I don't mean
it.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.067
You couldn't even knock out
a good wank.

05:55.267 --> 05:59.000
I'm feeling so much better about
me and Steph being friends
again,

05:59.067 --> 06:01.167
and we're back
to being house sisters.

06:04.533 --> 06:08.333
I know we're back to being
friends,
but farting on us, Abbie,
really?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.500
Was it bad?

06:09.567 --> 06:11.567
Yeah, it is.
I'm gonna sit over here.

06:19.900 --> 06:23.367
Mate, I'm fucking sweating.
It's fucking hell.

06:23.433 --> 06:26.300
It feels good to be back in the
gym
and hitting the bag,

06:26.367 --> 06:29.900
but I do feel a little bit
rusty.
This booze is taking its toll.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.433
Tiring, isn't it?
Tiring, mate. Fucking hell.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.333
How did you feel
when Chloe dropped the
"boyfriend"?

06:35.400 --> 06:39.767
She's done it a few times now,
and
she keeps telling me she's
joking.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.767
She's hinting, isn't she?
Yeah. I think she's joking,

06:42.833 --> 06:45.767
but I want to make sure
it's at the right time.

06:45.833 --> 06:48.367
Sam and Chloe
are really good together.

06:48.433 --> 06:51.600
I've never seen Chloe this
happy,
but it is coming to the end

06:51.667 --> 06:54.200
and I would love them
to leave in a relationship.

06:54.267 --> 06:58.433
The advice I would give you is,
last
time me and Marnie were in the
house,

06:58.500 --> 07:02.167
we were probably closer than we
were
when we were in a relationship.

07:02.233 --> 07:05.800
We didn't ask that question
and we've come back in
relationships.

07:05.867 --> 07:09.667
So had I asked the question, who
knows what would have happened
now?

07:09.733 --> 07:14.067
Aaron could have made Marnie
his girlfriend and he didn't,

07:14.133 --> 07:15.700
and look where they are now.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.733
I don't know whether
I want to make the same mistake

07:18.800 --> 07:20.200
cos Aaron regrets it.

07:20.267 --> 07:24.333
I just need to make sure that
the timing and everything is
right.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.633
Let's have a few more rounds,
then.
Yeah.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.133
(phone rings)

07:39.933 --> 07:42.533
(Sam) The phone rings
and we all know who it is.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.067
Anna better not have work for us
today, with it being the last
day.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.533
Hello.
"Hiya, Sam. How are you?"

07:48.600 --> 07:50.500
Hiya. I'm good, thanks. Are you?

07:50.567 --> 07:52.667
"Yeah.
I've got another job for you."

07:54.233 --> 07:56.367
What did they say?
So, we've got work.

07:56.433 --> 07:59.533
Me, Abbie, Steph, Sophie.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.533
We're going to Sunderland
to promote food.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.400
I don't know what type of food.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.100
I suggest yous go and get ready.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.600
Anna, you are a diamond.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.800
I am absolutely buzzing
that I'm not working today.

08:10.867 --> 08:13.267
We need to go and watch.
Let's go get ready.

08:17.733 --> 08:20.100
Ha-ha, yous have got to go to
work!

08:20.167 --> 08:23.667
I can't believe
that Anna has separated us all
today.

08:23.733 --> 08:26.267
I thought the last day,
we'd all be together.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.467
Why is it always me working?

08:30.533 --> 08:33.267
Either I'm doing a good job
or Anna doesn't like me.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.732
A very good job, Sam.
Oh.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.232
Right, Sam, get yourself to
work,
lad,

08:38.299 --> 08:41.467
whilst we go for a lovely
little drink. Go on, fuck off.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.500
This is an absolute piss-take.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.933
Why are these coming along with
us
to work

08:46.000 --> 08:48.567
when they are going
to the fucking pub?

08:50.267 --> 08:52.167
Our job today is to give out
leaflets

08:52.233 --> 08:54.667
and tell the public
about pease pudding.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.933
Pease pudding is a north east
delicacy. It can't be that hard.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.600
You're the new girl.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.133
Why the fuck do I have to wear
this?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.633
Hello there.
Hi.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.400
Would you try pease pudding?

09:05.467 --> 09:10.233
Do you know much about pease
pudding?
Well, I know it's made from
peas.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.233
Shall we go to the pub?
Yeah.

09:14.300 --> 09:17.100
We've come to the beach
and it's fucking freezing.

09:17.167 --> 09:21.733
I think we deserve
a nice refreshing little drink.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.233
We'll get the drinks.
That one. Right, OK.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.267
Marnie is the only girl in this
house

09:26.333 --> 09:28.700
who was in a similar situation
to me and Sam,

09:28.767 --> 09:30.800
so it's good to get advice from
her.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.767
I feel like yous will be happy.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.033
I think yous are so strong.
Do you think?

09:35.100 --> 09:37.167
Like, I just...
I just really like him.

09:37.233 --> 09:38.767
I never been in this position

09:38.833 --> 09:41.933
where I've been in the house
and liked someone this much.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.367
Are you in love?
I don't know.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.567
What if you never seen him
again?
Awful.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.600
That might mean that you're in
love.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.233
Do you think he's gonna take it
to the next level?

09:51.300 --> 09:55.667
It would be nice, but I don't
want
him to ask cos we've got a day
left.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.133
I'd rather it be real,
you know what I mean?

09:58.200 --> 10:01.767
I don't want Sam to be scared by
thinking that I want it really
bad.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.533
I want him to ask me in his own
time.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.500
It'd be lovely.
Follow your heart, that's my
advice.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.367
Follow your heart.
Yeah.

10:11.867 --> 10:14.467
How are yous?
Would you like some pease
pudding?

10:14.533 --> 10:16.967
I'd love some.
Ah, there we go.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.500
Do you know much about it?

10:21.933 --> 10:25.000
We should have a lot of
knowledge
about pease pudding,

10:25.067 --> 10:28.033
but everybody else
has a lot more knowledge than
us.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.900
Do you want me to feed ya?
I think I'll feed meself.

10:31.967 --> 10:34.533
How do you feel about that one?
Is it a good one?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.967
Would you recommend?
Yeah, it's fine.

10:37.033 --> 10:40.433
Work has gone really well.
People have tried the pease
pudding,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.633
told us a lot about pease
pudding

10:42.700 --> 10:45.067
and Steph is dressed
like pease pudding.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.433
I'm feeling the blue and yellow.
It's fucking hideous.

10:50.500 --> 10:54.000
Excuse me! Here's the riffraff!
Here's the riffraff.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.367
Chloe's just come back.

10:55.433 --> 10:58.067
I've been thinking about
what Aaron said all day,

10:58.133 --> 11:01.500
and if I don't ask her now
I might never get the chance
again.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.467
Chloe, wanna go for a chat?
Oh, he's missed her.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.533
Aw!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.567
Shit. Sam has asked to speak to
us.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.300
Is he going to ask us
to be his girlfriend?

11:10.367 --> 11:12.600
I wanna take you out
to this restaurant

11:12.667 --> 11:14.533
cos I want to ask you something.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.200
Whether I ask Chloe
to be my girlfriend or not,

11:17.267 --> 11:19.733
I want our last night
in the house to be perfect,

11:19.800 --> 11:21.400
so I want to take her on a date.

11:21.467 --> 11:24.633
Promise ya it's really nice.
Not in the air. In the water.

11:24.700 --> 11:27.633
The chicken shop!
No, it's really nice and
romantic.

11:27.700 --> 11:30.867
Sam, this date better be
everything
you say it's going to be,

11:30.933 --> 11:33.233
because if I'm going to wear
my best frock,

11:33.300 --> 11:35.533
I do not want to be
left disappointed.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.467
Howay, then. Howay.
Hiya.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.967
Hiya.
Hello, everybody.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.133
Chloe and Sam walk back giggling
and acting really weird.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.967
What on earth has Sam said to
her?

11:45.033 --> 11:48.300
So, Sam is going to take me out
somewhere tonight.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.267
He's got something to ask us.
Ooh!

11:51.333 --> 11:54.567
Well done, Sam. You know
you're doing the right thing.

11:54.633 --> 11:56.533
If you never ask, you'll never
know.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.300
Us girls need to help Chloe
look incredible.

11:59.367 --> 12:02.233
(girls) Yeah! Howay!
Roll on date night.

12:02.300 --> 12:03.900
Last night, bitches!

12:03.967 --> 12:06.433
We are going to go out with a
bang.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.600
To the family!

12:07.667 --> 12:10.200
I've got a question to ask.
My God, what is it?

12:10.267 --> 12:15.300
For the first time in her life,
Chloe Ferry is speechless.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.600
Oh, my God.

12:16.667 --> 12:19.167
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:21.100 --> 12:21.300
.

12:23.833 --> 12:24.033
.

12:35.733 --> 12:38.667
There's no time to waste.
I need to get ready for tonight

12:38.733 --> 12:41.467
cos I wanna look absolutely
stunning
for Sam.

12:41.533 --> 12:44.300
Chloe, it's your big date.
Argh!

12:45.900 --> 12:48.167
I'm going on a date.
I'm going on a date.

12:48.233 --> 12:51.233
This?
No. Definitely not wearing that.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.333
There we go, my love.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.600
So, Sophie, hair straight.
Cut a little bit off the length.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.800
What do you think he's gonna
ask?
Not to be his girlfriend.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.833
How do you feel?
Yeah, but yeah, I'd say yes.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.567
There you go.
Chloe's getting her hopes built
up

13:07.633 --> 13:10.267
and I just hope to God
that Sam asks her out now,

13:10.333 --> 13:13.867
otherwise our last night
is gonna be pure murders.

13:13.933 --> 13:16.133
Chloe, some Dutch courage.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.833
I am crossing me fingers,
me toes and me legs

13:18.900 --> 13:22.100
that tonight Sam finally asks us
to be his girlfriend.

13:22.167 --> 13:25.767
I have never felt like this
about anyone. Not even Marty.

13:25.833 --> 13:27.333
(girls) Down it, down it!

13:27.400 --> 13:29.667
No, I'll sip it.

13:31.267 --> 13:33.633
Chloe, are you ready?
Where is the queen?

13:33.700 --> 13:36.067
Wait there!
I'm trying to shut me bag!

13:36.133 --> 13:38.400
I'm really, really excited
for tonight,

13:38.467 --> 13:41.733
but I'm just so scared
in case things do not go right.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.933
Yay!

13:45.000 --> 13:46.200
Pick your jaw up.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.067
You look nice, Sam.
You look unbelievable.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.933
Fucking hell,
Chloe looks unbelievable.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.333
I'm feeling
a little bit nervous now.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.933
(girls) Ah!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.967
See you later.
Bye. Good luck!

13:59.033 --> 14:00.733
I'm so happy for Chloe and Sam.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.967
Looking back,
me and him were never suited.

14:04.033 --> 14:07.933
The right girl has definitely
won
and they are perfect together.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.200
I feel like we need
to get ready now.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.900
Let's get ready, bitches!

14:11.967 --> 14:14.367
Last night, bitches!

14:24.233 --> 14:25.233
(laughs)

14:27.367 --> 14:31.000
I'm anxious because I genuinely
do
have strong feelings for Chloe

14:31.067 --> 14:33.200
and I just want this date
to go perfect.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.867
Oh, my God, we've arrived,

14:38.933 --> 14:42.433
and thank God,
it's not a chicken fucking shop.

14:42.500 --> 14:46.167
It's a nice, sophisticated,
posh, ladylike restaurant.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.367
To our last night
in the house together.

14:48.433 --> 14:50.267
Last night. Cheers.
Cheers.

14:50.333 --> 14:53.700
Chloe's different to other girls
because she actually gets me.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.833
I'm not all there and neither's
she.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.967
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
Yeah.

14:58.033 --> 14:59.567
Do you recognise it?
I do.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.767
I think you wore it
on the chicken date.

15:01.833 --> 15:05.533
No. Think again. Remember the
first
day I walked into the house?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.567
Oh, yeah!
I worn that.

15:07.633 --> 15:10.233
Oh, my God, you did.
I thought I'd wear it again.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.833
We started there on our first
day
in the house together

15:13.900 --> 15:17.367
and now it's our last day in
the house and look how close we
are.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.467
Oh, my God, Sam. That's so nice.

15:19.533 --> 15:23.567
This is the cheesiest thing that
anyone has ever, ever done for
us.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.000
I fucking love it.

15:25.067 --> 15:28.067
I think now I couldn't be
in this house without you.

15:28.133 --> 15:31.467
You're being dead cute tonight.
You paid for me food.

15:31.533 --> 15:32.533
(laughs)

15:32.600 --> 15:36.567
No lad has ever been this nice
with us before. It's so
romantic.

15:36.633 --> 15:39.933
If anyone asks, "What's her best
trait?" Your personality.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Anyone can be good looking,
but you need something else.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.833
I've never came across anybody
who makes us laugh the way you
do.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.333
This is the first time I've
spoken about my feelings to
Chloe

15:50.400 --> 15:53.500
because I've never felt for a
girl
the way I feel for her.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.633
You're really cute.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.933
I thought there
was a cat under the table.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.100
What?
You've got fluff on your feet.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.033
I thought it was a cat.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.533
The date is going well,

16:03.600 --> 16:07.367
and the time has come to ask
Chloe
the all-important question.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.433
So, I've got a question to ask.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.633
Oh, my God, what is it?

16:13.633 --> 16:15.300
Do you want dessert?

16:15.367 --> 16:17.967
Oh, is that it?
Of course I want fucking
dessert.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.067
I'm still starving.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.467
Chloe and Sam are out on their
date

16:29.533 --> 16:32.100
and we're getting ready
for the final night out.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.567
It's gonna be a big one.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.867
I reckon tonight, last night,
the house is tidy.

16:39.933 --> 16:43.733
Fuck the place up.
Let Anna deal with it.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.767
I want to have the biggest
food fight we've ever had.

16:46.833 --> 16:49.200
You go get the ammo
whilst I get ready.

16:49.267 --> 16:50.767
I've got this.

16:50.833 --> 16:54.767
To be one step ahead, I'm gonna
make
sure I've got all the supplies

16:54.833 --> 16:56.600
so there is no way we can lose.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.633
Oh, yes.

16:59.667 --> 17:03.000
Did you see how nervous Chloe
was?
I think he's gonna ask her out.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.700
I think it's a nice thing to do.

17:04.767 --> 17:08.000
If Sam does officially ask Chloe
to become his girlfriend,

17:08.067 --> 17:11.133
it will make her
the happiest girl ever.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.733
He better not let her down,
or else he'll have me to deal
with.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.733
Think they'll be the new Marron?

17:16.800 --> 17:20.133
Never.
Never. No-one will ever beat
Marron.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.500
Ladies!

17:21.567 --> 17:22.700
Yous look lovely.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.032
So do you.
So do you.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.267
I like the theme.
What is the theme?

17:26.333 --> 17:30.167
Girl band PVC realness.
Right, howay, then. Give us a
drink.

17:30.233 --> 17:34.233
To Chloe and Sam
and to our last night in the
house.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.467
(all) Till next time!

17:36.533 --> 17:38.067
Cheers to the final night.

17:38.133 --> 17:42.133
Now let's get out of here, get
to the club and get fucking
mortal.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.400
(all cheer)

17:51.467 --> 17:54.933
We get to Bijoux. There's no
better
place to spend the last night.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.433
This is where the family
always kick off, in a good way.

18:04.767 --> 18:10.167
We're dolled up. We're raring to
go,
cos we are gonna go out with a
bang.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.867
To the family!

18:18.967 --> 18:21.633
Sophie, Chloe is never gonna say
no.

18:21.700 --> 18:25.033
There's more chance of me
turning
straight than her saying no.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.467
It's never gonna happen.

18:36.267 --> 18:38.633
So, I brought you here
to ask you something.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.300
So, when I talked to Aaron,

18:40.367 --> 18:43.367
he explained that when him
and Marnie were in the house,

18:43.433 --> 18:45.667
they were in a similar position.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.400
And he said
he didn't actually ask her
anything.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.233
When he left the house,
them two went separate ways.

18:51.300 --> 18:55.200
And, like, I don't want that
to happen to me and you, so,
like...

18:55.267 --> 18:56.767
What do you mean?

18:56.833 --> 18:58.167
Yes?

18:58.233 --> 19:01.600
I don't want us to leave the
house
and go separate ways.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.200
Right.
So... I got you a little
dessert.

19:05.267 --> 19:08.000
(waiter) There we are.
Two spoons for you guys.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.367
Thank you.

19:10.433 --> 19:11.800
(laughs)

19:11.867 --> 19:15.267
For the first time in her life,
Chloe Ferry is speechless.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.767
Oh, my God. "Will you be my
lass?"

19:22.367 --> 19:26.100
Is this really happening? Sam
has
just asked me to be his
girlfriend.

19:26.167 --> 19:29.467
With everything we've been
through,
he's actually done it!

19:30.600 --> 19:32.567
Yes.
(both laugh)

19:32.633 --> 19:33.900
Of course I will.

19:34.833 --> 19:37.833
Oh, my God, that's so nice.
Is that all right?

19:37.900 --> 19:41.367
Chloe's the most beautiful,
funny,
slightly crazy girl

19:41.433 --> 19:45.100
that I've ever met in my life,
and now she's my girlfriend.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.400
I'm still in shock.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.767
I think I've got make-up all
over.
Me too.

19:48.833 --> 19:50.233
I can't believe that.

19:50.300 --> 19:53.733
I have got a boyfriend, and Sam
could not have done it better.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.867
I'm literally over the moon.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.067
I do think I love you.
Do ya?

19:58.133 --> 20:00.767
I think so.
After that, after that I think I
do.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.400
Aaron, do you love Marnie?
Yes.

20:12.467 --> 20:14.900
Surprise, motherfuckers!

20:19.033 --> 20:21.500
Marnie is never bothered
about being sick,

20:21.567 --> 20:23.967
so why this time go to the
toilet?

20:24.033 --> 20:26.100
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

20:28.567 --> 20:28.767
.

20:31.300 --> 20:31.500
.

20:44.467 --> 20:48.333
Chloe and Sam still aren't here
yet.
I hope that it's going well.

20:51.367 --> 20:55.833
I cannot wait to tell everyone
that me and Sam are finally a
couple.

20:59.933 --> 21:05.500
Oh, my God, it's about fucking
time!
I'm finally gonna be a
bridesmaid!

21:07.567 --> 21:09.967
Finding out that
Chloe now has a boyfriend

21:10.033 --> 21:12.967
is going to make our last night
even better.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.300
I'm so happy for them.

21:20.700 --> 21:24.367
I can't believe Sam and Chloe
are boyfriend and girlfriend.

21:24.433 --> 21:27.167
This is amazing.
Let's get the shots in to
celebrate.

21:31.233 --> 21:33.733
This could not have come
at a better time.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.467
I'm with me family and I'm
getting
pissed. This is the life.

21:57.967 --> 22:01.400
Aaron has played a big part
in helping me make my decision.

22:01.467 --> 22:05.000
I feel like I've made the best
decision. I could not be
happier.

22:07.733 --> 22:11.400
I've never seen Chloe this happy
and I'm absolutely buzzing for
her.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.633
Chloe is the happiest
she's ever been.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.400
She's overcome with emotion.

22:26.467 --> 22:29.133
She can't even hold in
the tears of happiness.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.333
Nathan is taking this way too
far.
I'm going for a dance.

23:01.867 --> 23:05.600
Tonight has been fucking
amazing.
Everyone is in such good moods.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.400
I just can't believe
it's our last night together.

23:08.467 --> 23:09.933
So much has gone on.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.067
Me and Sam came in the house
the same time,

23:17.133 --> 23:20.367
but our experiences couldn't
have been any more different.

23:20.433 --> 23:24.433
I may not have found love, but
I've defo found friends for
life.

23:29.900 --> 23:32.933
I'm so glad we're all back
together,
as a family,

23:33.000 --> 23:34.733
having fun on the last night.

23:36.467 --> 23:39.500
Sam, I want to see
how committed you are.

23:39.567 --> 23:43.033
This is some initiation. Three
of the worst shots in one glass.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.467
I told the lads when I came in
this
house that I was the biggest
drinker

23:52.533 --> 23:54.400
and I think that has just proven
it.

23:56.367 --> 23:59.600
How the fuck Sam has just necked
that drink I will never know.

23:59.667 --> 24:01.767
I would have spewed
at the smell of it.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.167
Easy, easy.

24:08.233 --> 24:11.500
This is how
all last nights should be.

24:11.567 --> 24:15.000
Everybody enjoying each other's
company, nobody on the pull

24:15.067 --> 24:17.033
and just having a good fucking
time.

24:22.867 --> 24:25.700
This cork must be superglued
into the fucking bottle.

24:25.767 --> 24:28.733
Not one of wor can pop it.
It's actually embarrassing.

24:30.967 --> 24:33.033
If you're gonna spray someone,

24:33.100 --> 24:35.433
firstly you've got to open
the bottle.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.333
Tonight, there is love in the
air,

24:54.400 --> 24:58.367
and by the looks of it, everyone
is
feeling it, even Marnie and
Aaron.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.667
People can say what they want,
but no-one will ever beat
Marron.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.467
No-one in this world

25:20.533 --> 25:24.100
will understand the friendship
and bond between Aaron and
Marnie,

25:24.167 --> 25:26.967
and I myself are still
struggling
to figure it out.

25:43.267 --> 25:44.400
Tonight has been mint

25:44.467 --> 25:47.667
and I can't wait to get back
to the house and carry on the
party.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.000
(Sophie) Are you two happy for
Chloe?

25:56.067 --> 25:58.933
Aaron, I know you like Marnie,
right, but do you...

25:59.000 --> 26:01.300
I, I, I love Marnie
and she's beautiful.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.267
What, haway!

26:03.333 --> 26:06.233
But do you love Marnie?
Yes.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.533
Stop the fucking bus.

26:09.600 --> 26:14.100
Wait, has Aaron just openly
admitted
that he loves Marnie?

26:14.167 --> 26:15.167
What the hell?

26:15.233 --> 26:18.433
Fuck, Aaron, Aaron,
one more question.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.267
Do you think there's a future
with you and Marns?

26:21.333 --> 26:23.267
Sophie, that's a silly question.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.767
You know I love Marnie
but I'm not in love with Marnie.

26:26.833 --> 26:29.433
All I'm gonna say
is no-one will ever beat Marron.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.000
No matter what relationship
status
Marnie and Aaron are in,

26:33.067 --> 26:35.200
Aaron will have
a soft spot for Marnie.

26:35.267 --> 26:37.600
Will Chloe and Sam beat Marron?

26:37.667 --> 26:40.300
They'd be Scam.
Scammers, they'd be Scam!

26:40.367 --> 26:43.900
They will never beat Marron!
Ever!

26:43.967 --> 26:45.633
Fuck Scam! Fuck Scam!

26:51.433 --> 26:53.600
Chicken!
Chicken!

26:53.667 --> 26:56.733
Party poppers!

26:57.533 --> 27:01.467
It's been the best night I've
ever
had in here, in my life.
Honestly.

27:01.533 --> 27:03.433
Hey!

27:03.500 --> 27:04.833
Speech!

27:04.900 --> 27:08.467
You are honestly the most
beautiful
person that I actually know,

27:08.533 --> 27:11.700
and your personality is so
beautiful
and I love ya.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.067
(Abbie) Aw!

27:13.133 --> 27:16.333
You know, I didn't realise it,
but I think I love you too.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.967
Oh, my God.

27:18.033 --> 27:20.400
I can't believe I've just said
that.

27:20.467 --> 27:23.633
I've either had one too many
or I mean it.

27:24.567 --> 27:27.200
Can this night
get actually any better?

27:27.267 --> 27:29.733
I think everyone
should raise a piece of food

27:29.800 --> 27:33.033
to Sam and fucking Chloe.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.800
Sloe!
Clam, Clam.

27:35.867 --> 27:38.500
Sam, there's no way
you're calling us Sloe.

27:38.567 --> 27:40.000
It's Clam, for fuck's sake.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.100
It wouldn't be the final night

27:45.167 --> 27:50.267
without any kind
of motherfucking surprise.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.033
The last night
wouldn't be a good last night

27:53.100 --> 27:57.333
without a big, messy, wet
surprise.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.800
Surprise, motherfuckers!

28:00.867 --> 28:03.100
Who wants beans on toast?

28:05.333 --> 28:07.800
Oh, my God!
I am not having a food fight.

28:07.867 --> 28:10.033
I've just washed me fucking
hair,
man!

28:12.800 --> 28:13.900
(shouting)

28:19.100 --> 28:21.767
(Sam) This house has gone
absolutely mental.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.467
Nobody can keep their feet

28:23.533 --> 28:26.600
and there's fucking food
flying about everywhere.

28:28.233 --> 28:30.967
Oh, my God! I can't see!

28:31.033 --> 28:33.633
Aaron! Aaron! Marnie!

28:33.700 --> 28:35.800
Aaron, you're meant
to be on my team,

28:35.867 --> 28:37.733
you double-crossing bitch!

28:37.800 --> 28:39.633
Who wants some kebab?

28:41.567 --> 28:42.800
Without a doubt,

28:42.867 --> 28:46.800
this is the biggest food fight
we have ever had in this house.

28:46.867 --> 28:49.133
Thank God it's the final night,

28:49.200 --> 28:51.667
cos I do not fancy
having to clean this up.

28:51.733 --> 28:53.233
(shouting)

28:56.967 --> 29:00.033
These lot might be disgusting,
but they're my family.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.200
Come to think about it,
they're more like me pets.

29:09.733 --> 29:14.567
Tonight, I thought I'd be making
sweet love to my new boyfriend,

29:14.633 --> 29:18.333
but instead of slipping into me,
he's slipping on the fucking
floor.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.067
Everyone's rolling around in
cream,

29:26.133 --> 29:30.500
but Aaron and Marnie seem like
they're taking it to the next
level.

29:30.567 --> 29:31.900
I can't see!

29:39.200 --> 29:42.600
This has gone from being a food
fight to a homoerotic fantasy.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.633
Stop!

29:47.700 --> 29:49.067
(shouting)

29:49.133 --> 29:51.400
I've managed to stay
quite clean so far.

29:51.467 --> 29:54.433
What's going on?
I'm normally a scruff bag.

29:54.500 --> 29:56.600
If you can't beat them, join
them.

29:58.733 --> 30:00.133
Hot tub!

30:00.200 --> 30:02.967
No last night would be complete
without hot tub.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.400
The best food fight of all time
is now finished,

30:08.467 --> 30:11.300
so we need to go in the hot tub
and rinse off.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.900
(whooping)

30:22.433 --> 30:24.100
(shouting)

30:25.900 --> 30:28.933
To top it off,
Nathan is spewing over the hot
tub.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.200
This has got to be
the messiest night ever.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.167
(retches)

30:35.233 --> 30:38.767
I have never ever been
in a family so fucked up...

30:38.833 --> 30:40.200
Fucked up, man!

30:40.267 --> 30:43.133
...as yous radge cunts!

30:43.200 --> 30:46.967
This family is the most
fucked-up
family I've came across in my
life,

30:47.033 --> 30:48.400
and I fucking love it.

30:48.467 --> 30:49.600
Yeah, bye, Nathan.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.500
Food fight, done. Hot tub, done.

30:52.567 --> 30:54.300
Shower, complete.

30:54.367 --> 30:57.567
Now it's time for bed,
because tomorrow we're leaving.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.367
(shouting)

31:07.833 --> 31:11.400
Come here, girlfriend.
You're all mine tonight.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.267
I'm trying to get to bed and
Aaron and Marnie keep
whispering.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.500
Third wheel, anyone?

31:34.567 --> 31:37.133
Obviously, Marnie,
I do care a lot about you,

31:37.200 --> 31:40.300
so if you're being sick,
I'm gonna be there for you.

31:42.133 --> 31:46.967
Marnie is never bothered about
being sick in public or in a
bin,

31:47.033 --> 31:48.867
so why this time go to the
toilet?

31:59.467 --> 32:03.233
Fucking hell. I bet her throat's
sore from being sick that long.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.667
(giggling)

32:33.067 --> 32:36.900
Morning, boyfriend.
Morning, girlfriend.

32:36.967 --> 32:38.000
Woohoo!

32:38.067 --> 32:42.067
Marns, when you were being sick,
why
did Aaron come and hold your
hair?

32:42.133 --> 32:44.300
Nathan, stop being
such a shit-stirrer.

32:44.367 --> 32:47.333
I was sick and Aaron was helpin'
us.
Nothing happened.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.667
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

32:52.067 --> 32:52.267
.

32:54.800 --> 32:55.000
.

33:08.833 --> 33:12.633
Morning, boyfriend.
Morning, girlfriend.

33:12.700 --> 33:16.200
Last night was the best night
I've ever had in this house.

33:16.267 --> 33:19.767
I have got a boyfriend now.
Woohoo!

33:19.833 --> 33:23.567
It was one of the best nights
ever.
It was literally unbelievable.

33:23.633 --> 33:27.167
From minute one when we, like,
left the door to go on our date,

33:27.233 --> 33:30.600
to getting back to the club,
to getting back to the house.

33:30.667 --> 33:34.267
I daren't even go in the house
to see what it looks like.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.367
last night in the house
was absolutely unbelievable.

33:37.433 --> 33:40.500
Well, the bits that I can
remember.
I was fucking mortal.

33:40.567 --> 33:42.767
I am happy, you know.
I know, I can tell.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.000
You haven't stopped smiling.

33:45.067 --> 33:47.133
I know. Me jaw's fucking
knackered.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.600
I'm gonna have
to go and see a jawcologist.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.633
Honestly, no, I am very happy.

33:52.700 --> 33:55.467
I'm excited to see
what happens on the outside.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.700
Honestly, I can't wait.
Without all these freaks around.

33:58.767 --> 34:02.600
Giving out their advice.
These freaks that we call
family.

34:02.667 --> 34:05.333
I'm gonna be gutted to leave,
but I know one person

34:05.400 --> 34:08.033
who I will be spending time with
on the outside.

34:08.100 --> 34:12.000
Sam has been so mushy. I feel
like
he's really enjoyed his time
here.

34:12.067 --> 34:14.766
He's got a new family
and he's got a new girlfriend.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.000
Morning.
(both) Morning.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.933
How are yous?
What the fuck happened
downstairs?

34:23.000 --> 34:26.867
It was so bad, Sophie.
Last night was the worst one.

34:26.933 --> 34:30.100
The food fight last night
sounded like it was a lot of fun

34:30.167 --> 34:33.933
but the smell of all this
is making me want to vomit.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.900
Oh, so is Marnie in the lads'
room,
then?

34:36.967 --> 34:39.033
None of us girls
know where Marnie is,

34:39.100 --> 34:42.000
but I've got a pretty good guess
of where she will be.

34:42.067 --> 34:43.766
In the boys' room with Aaron.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.367
Last night
those two were inseparable.

34:46.433 --> 34:49.233
Glad that they've been
really good friends now.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.867
I think that was the balance
that they needed.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.500
Yous, it's the last day.

34:55.567 --> 34:56.600
It's the last day,

34:56.667 --> 35:00.367
but last night was literally
the biggest and the best food
fight

35:00.433 --> 35:01.567
we have ever had.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.267
Everyone got hit.

35:03.333 --> 35:05.100
I'm so happy for Chloe and Sam.

35:05.167 --> 35:07.400
I think they're gonna
break the curse

35:07.467 --> 35:09.533
of Geordie Shore relationships.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.933
Do ya?
Yeah.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.467
I do think
yous have been extremely close.

35:13.533 --> 35:16.000
Basically, we haven't
done anything wrong.

35:16.067 --> 35:19.067
Everything with me
and Aaron has been very
innocent.

35:19.133 --> 35:22.600
People get the wrong impression
about me and Aaron,

35:22.667 --> 35:25.600
but honestly, me and Aaron
are better as friends.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.500
We've never, ever, ever got on
as good as we do now.

35:28.567 --> 35:31.700
We had boundaries and I think
we stuck to them very well.

35:31.767 --> 35:33.433
You've tested boundaries.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.267
Right,
I'm going to make a cup of tea.

35:36.333 --> 35:39.767
Will you make us one?
Do you know what? Yes.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.700
Good luck in that fucking
kitchen,
mate. Oh, fuck.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.533
Morning, shaggers.
Hello, yous.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.633
Good morning. How the fuck
are you meant to get round here?

35:52.700 --> 35:55.000
I'm surprised
there's food left to cook.

35:55.067 --> 35:56.567
I thought we threw it all.

35:56.633 --> 36:00.233
Right, last night when we went
to bed, something weird
happened.

36:00.300 --> 36:03.233
What?
Aaron and Marnie went to the
toilet.

36:03.300 --> 36:05.733
When they came out,
they were really giggly.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.733
I don't know what happened in
there.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.167
I hope they haven't
done anything silly,

36:10.233 --> 36:12.333
especially not on the last
night.

36:12.400 --> 36:16.333
It is weird, but they are very
close
and there's alcohol involved,

36:16.400 --> 36:19.533
but nothing would ever happen
between them.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.667
They wouldn't have hooked up.
They were drunk, though.

36:22.733 --> 36:25.667
If it did,
they've just fucked everything.

36:25.733 --> 36:30.000
I suppose they'll have each
other.
I'm not gonna fucking ask.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.533
Everyone can speculate
all they want,

36:32.600 --> 36:35.667
cos we do love gossip, but I
want
to find out what happened.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.867
Everyone, breakfast!
Breakfast is ready!

36:41.933 --> 36:43.733
Howay.
Shit.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.200
Yous, I need... I need
protection.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.600
Last night was one of
the best nights I've ever had.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.833
It was unbelievable.

36:51.900 --> 36:54.133
I think that was
the best time around.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.733
That is the nicest end
to this whole time.

36:57.800 --> 37:01.633
Marns, remember in the middle of
the night when you were being
sick?

37:01.700 --> 37:03.833
Why did Aaron
come and hold your hair?

37:03.900 --> 37:07.933
Is Nathan seriously asking this
in front of everyone?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.600
Talk about awkward.

37:09.667 --> 37:12.467
She went, "I'm gonna be sick
on the floor."

37:12.533 --> 37:14.767
I was like, "No, don't. Get up."

37:14.833 --> 37:17.700
"I'll take you to the toilet
to be sick." Yeah.

37:17.767 --> 37:20.233
Listen, Nathan,
why are you bringing this up?

37:20.300 --> 37:22.933
Nothing happened
between me and Marnie.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.367
We're both in relationships,
so can you please fucking drop
it?

37:26.433 --> 37:29.367
That was a weird question to
ask.
Just being nosy.

37:29.433 --> 37:33.033
No, I think if anyone's being
sick
you want to help them.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.433
Nathan,
stop being such a shit-stirrer.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.400
I was sick and Aaron was helping
us.
Nothing happened.

37:38.467 --> 37:41.700
Right, I'm not being funny,
but why the fuck am I cleaning
up?

37:41.767 --> 37:44.467
Get me out of this shithole.
I'm gonna get ready.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.000
I've had the best time of me
life,
you know.

37:51.067 --> 37:54.367
Four seasons in Ibiza and
nothing tops how mad this place
is.

37:54.433 --> 37:57.100
Fucking hell,
that's saying something, then.

37:57.167 --> 38:00.000
This house is
the biggest nuthouse ever

38:00.067 --> 38:03.667
and these people are the biggest
radgies, but I love them.

38:03.733 --> 38:06.967
God, you're hanging, aren't ya?
I fucking got a hanger head.

38:10.700 --> 38:13.867
I feel like I know you too well,
but I cannot wait to come back.

38:13.933 --> 38:16.000
This is the best experience
of my life.

38:16.067 --> 38:18.633
It couldn't have went any
better.

38:18.700 --> 38:21.667
She's gonna have to send us
somewhere nice

38:21.733 --> 38:23.867
because this is unliveable.

38:23.933 --> 38:26.167
Get out.

38:26.233 --> 38:28.533
(shouting)
Oh, my God.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.533
You couldn't get out quick
enough,
Steph.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.267
I think Sam has fitted right in
with the boys' room.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.567
Yous both come in...
Been yourselves.

38:37.633 --> 38:40.867
...been yourselves, not put an
act
on and fitted in perfectly.

38:40.933 --> 38:43.500
(all) Aw!
No problem.

38:43.567 --> 38:45.833
I feel like you fit in so well,
Steph.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.233
I feel like all we've done is
laugh.
I know.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.000
Hi, girls. Hi.

38:51.667 --> 38:54.033
Party time!
Bring it on.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.867
This is Sam.
Yay!

38:56.933 --> 38:59.300
Abbie and Chloe's fannies
are pulsing.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.933
Hi.
She looks like Marnie with a
perm.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.367
Gaz won't be coming back.
To Gary fucking Beadle.

39:06.433 --> 39:07.867
Shot!

39:07.933 --> 39:12.033
Two single girls, one single
boy.
It's a recipe for disaster.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.067
Shit's about to go down.

39:16.067 --> 39:19.800
She knows I have been in his bed
and he's even fingered us.

39:19.867 --> 39:22.433
This has turned to absolute
carnage.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.267
I am the plant woman!

39:26.333 --> 39:30.733
That curling tong is special to
us,
so what is it doing up Nathan's
arse?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.067
(shrieks)

39:38.567 --> 39:40.600
I've just lost the fucking plot.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.533
Aaron, you won't be travelling.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.433
If Aaron's not going, I'm not.

39:45.500 --> 39:46.700
Tenerife!

39:48.500 --> 39:50.833
Everyone is shit-faced.

39:50.900 --> 39:54.433
I cannot take my eyes
off Chloe's arse.

39:54.500 --> 39:55.500
(shouts)

39:55.567 --> 39:57.133
Go on, have a good chew, love.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.633
I am so fucking angry!

40:02.900 --> 40:04.400
Fucking laughing!

40:05.633 --> 40:06.833
Fuck off.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.800
Fuck, I nearly killed Joel!

40:08.867 --> 40:11.567
Hallelujah. I had sex!

40:13.333 --> 40:16.133
I might be able to get him
to check out me vajayjay.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.667
(vomiting)
Oh, my God.

40:18.733 --> 40:22.867
They're all over each other.
It's
only right that I check on
Marnie.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.133
I'm sick of it.
I don't want to!

40:30.167 --> 40:32.000
(cheers, screams)

40:32.067 --> 40:34.967
You like chicken, don't ya?
Chicken fucking Cottage?

40:35.033 --> 40:37.667
"Will you be my lass?" Yes.

40:37.733 --> 40:39.433
I have got a boyfriend!

40:41.167 --> 40:43.733
I'm finally gonna be a
bridesmaid!

40:43.800 --> 40:45.033
Chloe and Sam!

40:46.000 --> 40:48.233
I love being part
of this mental family.

40:53.733 --> 40:56.267
I think someone should fuck off.
I'm gonna go.

40:56.333 --> 40:58.667
There's been tears,
there's been tantrums.

40:58.733 --> 41:00.333
This is one fucked-up family,

41:00.400 --> 41:02.600
but I love
every single one of them.

41:02.667 --> 41:05.233
Bye, watch what you're doing.
See you later.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.233
Me and Aaron have gotten through
this whole time

41:08.300 --> 41:10.067
and not had one argument.

41:10.133 --> 41:13.000
That's never happened before.
It's an achievement.

41:13.067 --> 41:15.400
(all) Bye.
I'm going to get off next.

41:15.467 --> 41:18.933
It wouldn't be a goodbye unless
the food was all over the walls,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.400
all over the floor
and kebab meat on the sofa.

41:22.467 --> 41:23.833
Exactly how I like it.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.833
See ya!
(all) Bye!

41:25.900 --> 41:29.200
It's been a pleasure, you know.
Come on, get your stuff.

41:29.267 --> 41:33.433
I can't believe the people that
I've met, I can now call them
family.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.267
It's been amazing.

41:35.333 --> 41:37.467
Nathan, I've got a little
surprise.

41:37.533 --> 41:39.700
What?
Me nana's picking us up.

41:39.767 --> 41:41.433
Hello!
(all) Hi.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.133
After the house party,

41:43.200 --> 41:46.200
I think Nana has left
a lasting impression on the
family.

41:46.267 --> 41:48.500
You were funny at the house
party.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.467
Shh, I don't want to hear about
it.
(laughter)

41:52.700 --> 41:54.533
This time it was hard for me.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.467
I nearly lost my friendship
with Chloe over Sam,

41:57.533 --> 41:59.433
but they are great together.

41:59.500 --> 42:02.100
I'm so sad to be leaving
the Geordie Shore house,

42:02.167 --> 42:04.967
but it makes me more excited
to come back next time.

42:05.033 --> 42:08.333
We've had our ups and downs.
You chinned us, but listen.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.133
I'm leaving Chloe and Sam
in Aaron's capable hands,

42:11.200 --> 42:14.500
and I've never been more happy
for that girl than I am right
now

42:14.567 --> 42:17.267
and I can't wait
to find out what happens next.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.367
Bye, guys! Love yous!
See you later.

42:19.433 --> 42:20.467
Fuck off!

42:22.233 --> 42:24.633
This is a bit weird
cos last time in the house

42:24.700 --> 42:27.467
it was me and Marnie leaving
almost as a couple,

42:27.533 --> 42:30.167
but I'm honestly so happy for
you,
Chloe.

42:30.233 --> 42:32.967
Thank you. Sam, mate,
you couldn't be a better lad.

42:33.033 --> 42:35.267
This is possibly the best job
I've had.

42:35.333 --> 42:38.767
The family is mental, but
I wouldn't change it for the
world.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.300
I am buzzing, you know, Sam,
like, I am.

42:42.367 --> 42:44.667
This is the happiest
I've been in the house.

42:44.733 --> 42:48.833
I'm just happy that I can make
you
that happy, do you know what I
mean?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.167
Sorry.

42:50.233 --> 42:51.733
I cannot wait to get out

42:51.800 --> 42:54.500
and start dating Chloe
away from everybody else.

42:54.567 --> 42:56.900
Who knows what's gonna happen?

42:56.967 --> 42:59.400
I guess I get in the front.
(both laugh)

42:59.467 --> 43:03.067
I'm leaving this house,
nearly in love, with a
boyfriend,

43:03.133 --> 43:05.400
and I cannot wait to do it all
again.

43:39.533 --> 43:39.733
.
