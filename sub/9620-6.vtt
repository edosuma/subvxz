00:26.025 --> 00:26.826

00:28.228 --> 00:30.730
&gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT'S YOUR JOB?

00:51.317 --> 00:52.952
UNLESS YOU TOUCH HER,

00:56.256 --> 00:57.424
&gt;&gt; TRUE JACKSON VP

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

01:45.605 --> 01:46.573
YOU KNOW.

01:46.639 --> 01:47.474
&gt;&gt; NOT AS MUCH AS ME

01:47.540 --> 01:48.508
AND MY GIRLFRIEND, KELSEY.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.478
&gt;&gt; NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

01:51.544 --> 01:52.345
&gt;&gt; YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,

01:52.412 --> 01:55.748
I MIGHT START BELIEVING IT.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.751
&gt;&gt; HOLD UP YOUR NUMBERS.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.220
NOTICE THAT NO TWO OF YOU

02:00.987 --> 02:03.289
OH, THAT'S INTERESTING.

KELSEY AND MIKEY J.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.826
BOTH HAVE THE NUMBER 27.

02:06.893 --> 02:07.494
WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:07.560 --> 02:08.628

&gt;&gt; DON'T KNOW, DON'T CARE.

02:10.730 --> 02:11.631
&gt;&gt; WRONG.

02:11.698 --> 02:12.398
TRUE?

02:12.465 --> 02:13.399
&gt;&gt; ONE IN A HUNDRED?

02:13.466 --> 02:14.834
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, BUT THE ODDS

02:14.901 --> 02:16.069
ARE OVER ONE IN A THOUSAND

02:16.135 --> 02:16.936
THAT THOSE TWO WOULD HAVE

02:17.003 --> 02:17.704
THE SAME COLOR.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.172
YOU HAVE THE SAME COLOR TOO?

02:19.239 --> 02:19.973
&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

02:20.039 --> 02:20.907
&gt;&gt; CRAZY, RIGHT?

02:20.974 --> 02:21.908
&gt;&gt; OH COME ON.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.410
WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF THAT?

02:24.477 --> 02:25.311
&gt;&gt; ONE IN A THOUSAND.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.080
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING?

02:27.146 --> 02:27.680
&gt;&gt; LOOKS LIKE

02:27.747 --> 02:28.815
WE HAVE TWO STUDENTS

02:28.882 --> 02:32.619
WITH A SPECIAL CONNECTION.

02:32.685 --> 02:33.486
YES?

02:33.553 --> 02:34.320
&gt;&gt; ARE WE EVER GONNA LEARN

02:34.387 --> 02:35.455
ACTUAL STUFF IN THIS CLASS?

02:35.522 --> 02:36.322
OR ARE WE JUST GONNA DO

02:36.389 --> 02:37.757
CARNIVAL TRICKS?

02:37.824 --> 02:38.791
&gt;&gt; MY FAMILY PAYS TAXES.

02:38.858 --> 02:48.468
I WANT AN EDUCATION.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.869
&gt;&gt; SORRY I'M LATE.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.004
MY BUS DRIVER GOT A PHONE CALL

02:51.070 --> 02:51.771
FROM HIS WIFE SAYING

02:51.838 --> 02:52.539
HE WON THE LOTTERY.

02:52.605 --> 02:53.239
HE PULLED OVER,

02:53.306 --> 02:55.174
SHOWED US HIS BUTT AND LEFT.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.376
WE HAD TO TALK SOME OLD MAN

02:56.442 --> 02:57.076
INTO DRIVING US

02:57.143 --> 02:58.244
THE REST OF THE WAY.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.446
&gt;&gt; YOU LOST ME AT "BUS."

03:00.513 --> 03:01.581
ANYWAY, WHILE MAX IS AWAY,

03:01.648 --> 03:02.549
THE MOST CAPABLE

03:02.615 --> 03:03.683
AND WORTHY SUCCESSOR

03:03.750 --> 03:05.585
TO THE THRONE WILL BE IN CHARGE,

03:05.652 --> 03:06.452

03:06.519 --> 03:07.687
&gt;&gt; WHERE'S MR. MADIGAN?

03:07.754 --> 03:08.922
&gt;&gt; HE'S TAKEN DORIS ON VACATION

03:08.988 --> 03:09.722
TO CELEBRATE

03:09.789 --> 03:10.957

03:11.024 --> 03:11.724
&gt;&gt; I'LL BET THEY WENT SOMEWHERE

03:11.791 --> 03:13.326
REALLY GLAMOROUS.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.027
WHERE ARE THEY?

03:14.093 --> 03:14.627
PARIS?

03:14.694 --> 03:15.228
LONDON?

03:15.295 --> 03:16.696
&gt;&gt; FARTWHISTLE, ARKANSAS.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.363
APPARENTLY,

03:17.430 --> 03:18.031
THEY HAVE A BALL OF STRING

03:18.097 --> 03:19.899
THE SIZE OF AN OFFICE BUILDING.

03:19.966 --> 03:20.667
&gt;&gt; FOR REAL?

03:20.733 --> 03:23.136
I HOPE THEY TAKE PICTURES.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.337
&gt;&gt; ANYWAY, BEFORE WE BEGIN,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.104
DOES ANYONE HAVE

03:25.171 --> 03:28.474
ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS?

03:28.541 --> 03:31.277

&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT SOMETHING!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.154
&gt;&gt; IS IT WORK-RELATED?

03:41.220 --> 03:41.821
&gt;&gt; KIND OF.

03:41.888 --> 03:42.722
I LIKE THIS BOY AT SCHOOL

03:42.789 --> 03:44.490
AND HE SENT ME FLOWERS.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.925
&gt;&gt; HOW IS THAT WORK-RELATED?

03:45.992 --> 03:46.726
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM

03:46.793 --> 03:49.529
AND I'M AT WORK.

AND A HEART OF GOLD.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.213
&gt;&gt; AND A WOODEN LEG.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.717
ANYWAY, AS YOU CAN SEE,

05:17.784 --> 05:18.451
LIFE IN THE MAILROOM

05:18.518 --> 05:19.519
IS PRETTY EXCITING.

05:19.585 --> 05:20.319
JUST THIS MORNING

05:20.386 --> 05:21.287
I FOUND OUT I'M UP

05:21.354 --> 05:22.488
FOR A POSTAL INTERNSHIP

05:22.555 --> 05:25.058
IN WASHINGTON.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.025
&gt;&gt; JIMMY?

05:26.092 --> 05:26.959
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY AMANDA.

05:27.026 --> 05:27.760
I WAS JUST TELLING THESE GUYS

05:27.827 --> 05:28.628
ABOUT MAIL.

05:28.695 --> 05:32.131
&gt;&gt; NO ONE CARES ABOUT MAIL.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.366
&gt;&gt; OKAY, ROLL 'EM.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.835
&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALREADY ROLLING.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.371
&gt;&gt; HMM, WEBSTER'S DEFINES

05:38.438 --> 05:40.139
GENIUS AS--

05:40.206 --> 05:42.508
&gt;&gt; UH, AMANDA,

05:42.575 --> 05:43.076
YOU MIGHT WANNA

05:43.142 --> 05:44.243
MOVE OVER A LITTLE.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.445
&gt;&gt; DON'T TELL ME WHERE I CAN

05:45.511 --> 05:52.852
OR CANNOT STAND.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.987
HA, HA, JOKE'S ON YOU.

05:55.054 --> 06:04.530
THAT DIDN'T EVEN HURT.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.565
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE.

06:05.631 --> 06:06.599
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY, JIMMY.

06:06.666 --> 06:07.300
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE MISS YOU

06:07.366 --> 06:08.000
AROUND HERE IN THE MORNINGS

06:08.067 --> 06:09.869
NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK AT SCHOOL.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.070
IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.538
ALTHOUGH AMANDA DID JUST GET HIT

06:12.605 --> 06:13.740
ON THE HEAD WITH A BOX.

06:13.806 --> 06:14.607
&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS AWESOME.

06:14.674 --> 06:15.341
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH.

06:15.408 --> 06:16.142
HANK LAUGHED SO HARD

06:16.209 --> 06:17.510
HIS VOICE-BOX SHORTED OUT.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.344
&gt;&gt; OH, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME

06:18.411 --> 06:19.212
WE ORDERED SUSHI

06:19.278 --> 06:19.812
AND AMANDA THOUGHT

06:19.879 --> 06:20.780
THE SPICY GREEN STUFF

06:20.847 --> 06:21.748
WAS A GUMBALL?

06:21.814 --> 06:22.982
SHE WAS ALL,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.384
"MY THROAT'S ON FIRE."

06:25.451 --> 06:26.185
&gt;&gt; HEY, DO YOU WANNA

06:26.252 --> 06:26.919
GRAB LUNCH LATER?

06:26.986 --> 06:27.587
THERE'S THAT NEW PLACE

06:27.653 --> 06:28.121
ON THE CORNER,

06:28.187 --> 06:29.455
S'MORE PLANTATION.

06:29.522 --> 06:30.189
&gt;&gt; S'MORE PLANTATION?

06:30.256 --> 06:31.224
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT

06:31.290 --> 06:31.924
JUST DESSERTS.

06:31.991 --> 06:32.592
THEY'VE GOT MEAT S'MORES,

06:32.658 --> 06:34.026
SEAFOOD S'MORES.

06:34.093 --> 06:34.861
I HEARD THE CHICKEN PARMA S'MORE

06:34.927 --> 06:36.963
IS PRETTY GOOD.

06:37.029 --> 06:37.730
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

06:37.797 --> 06:38.664
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD

06:38.731 --> 06:39.532
FOR ITALIAN.

06:39.599 --> 06:40.399
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

06:40.466 --> 06:42.101
THANKS, JIMMY.

06:42.168 --> 06:42.902
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE.

06:42.969 --> 06:43.469
&gt;&gt; HEY.

06:43.536 --> 06:44.237
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

06:44.303 --> 06:45.304
&gt;&gt; BREAKFAST S'MORE.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.806
YOU KNOW, CANADIAN BACON,

06:46.873 --> 06:48.741
POACHED EGG, MARSHMALLOW...

06:48.808 --> 06:49.442
&gt;&gt; CAN I TALK TO YOU

06:49.509 --> 06:51.144
ABOUT SOMETHING?

06:51.210 --> 06:51.811
I CAN'T TELL

06:51.878 --> 06:53.246
IF ME AND JUSTIN ARE DATING.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.013
&gt;&gt; WELL HAVE YOU BEEN ON A DATE?

06:54.080 --> 06:54.413
&gt;&gt; NO.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.348
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK YOU'RE DATING.

06:55.414 --> 06:56.682
&gt;&gt; BUT WE TALK ON THE PHONE

06:56.749 --> 06:57.583
EVERY NIGHT.

06:57.650 --> 06:58.985
AND HE SENT ME FLOWERS.

06:59.051 --> 06:59.986
THAT'S A BIG THING, RIGHT?

07:00.052 --> 07:01.154
&gt;&gt; I GUESS.

07:01.220 --> 07:01.988
&gt;&gt; YOU GUESS?

07:02.054 --> 07:02.622
THEY WERE PURPLE LILIES.

07:02.688 --> 07:03.523
THOSE AREN'T CHEAP.

07:03.589 --> 07:04.157
&gt;&gt; WELL, YEAH,

07:04.223 --> 07:05.024
BUT HE'S A BIG RAP STAR.

07:05.091 --> 07:05.792
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY

07:05.858 --> 07:06.492
FOR THINGS.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.226
ALL HE HAS TO DO IS

07:07.293 --> 07:07.927
SAY THE WORD FLOWERS

07:07.994 --> 07:08.461
IN AN INTERVIEW

07:08.528 --> 07:09.395
AND HE GETS THEM FREE FOREVER.

07:09.462 --> 07:09.896
&gt;&gt; OH, I'VE SEEN

07:09.962 --> 07:10.930
A BUNCH OF HIS INTERVIEWS

07:10.997 --> 07:11.798
AND I'VE NEVER HEARD HIM

07:11.864 --> 07:12.431
TALK ABOUT FLOWERS.

07:12.498 --> 07:12.865
ALL HE DOES

07:12.932 --> 07:13.933
IS TALK ABOUT SNEAKERS.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.101
&gt;&gt; WHICH ARE FREE!

07:15.168 --> 07:15.835
I'M GONNA GET SOMETHING

07:15.902 --> 07:17.937
FROM THE BREAK ROOM.

07:18.004 --> 07:18.905
&gt;&gt; AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE,

07:18.971 --> 07:20.273
I'M CONSTANTLY BEING INUNDATED

07:20.339 --> 07:21.541
WITH CALLS FROM NEW YORK'S

07:21.607 --> 07:23.276

07:33.619 --> 07:35.321
&gt;&gt; OH THAT OSCAR, SUCH A KIDDER.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.322

07:36.389 --> 07:36.923
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THAT?

07:36.989 --> 07:37.723
&gt;&gt; BUT MAD STYLE ISN'T

07:37.790 --> 07:39.025
ALL ABOUT FUN AND GAMES.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.159
UNDER MY SUPERVISION,

07:40.226 --> 07:41.894
THINGS RUN IN A VERY SERIOUS,

07:41.961 --> 07:43.396
SOPHISTICATED MANNER.

07:43.462 --> 07:44.797
&gt;&gt; AMANDA, CAN I BE EXCUSED

07:44.864 --> 07:45.565

08:18.097 --> 08:19.198
THINK OF A COLOR.

08:19.265 --> 08:19.966
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REALLY WANT TO.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.334
&gt;&gt; THINK OF A COLOR.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.702
&gt;&gt; FINE.

08:22.768 --> 08:24.904
OKAY, GOT IT.

08:24.971 --> 08:25.938

08:27.240 --> 08:28.641
&gt;&gt; IS IT GREEN?

08:28.708 --> 08:29.408
&gt;&gt; NO.

08:29.475 --> 08:30.576
&gt;&gt; IS IT PINK?

08:30.643 --> 08:33.346
&gt;&gt; I ALREADY SAID NO.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.313
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

08:34.380 --> 08:34.947
&gt;&gt; HE'S TRYING TO GUESS

08:35.014 --> 08:36.482

08:42.088 --> 08:42.755
A REALLY GOOD GUESSER.

08:42.822 --> 08:43.489

09:32.338 --> 09:34.307
&gt;&gt; I GOT LOST?

09:34.373 --> 09:35.107

09:35.975 --> 09:36.943

LOTTA FUN THAT TURNED OUT TO BE.

09:38.878 --> 09:39.745
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG?

09:39.812 --> 09:40.846
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG IS HE AND KELSEY

09:40.913 --> 09:42.381
HAVE THIS PSYCHIC CONNECTION.

09:42.448 --> 09:43.449
IT'S DRIVING ME AND RYAN BATTY,

09:43.516 --> 09:44.083
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

09:44.150 --> 09:44.917
ABOUT IT.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.118
&gt;&gt; UNLESS YOU AND RYAN

09:46.185 --> 09:46.886
PRETEND TO HAVE

09:46.953 --> 09:48.220
SOME SORT OF PSYCHIC CONNECTION.

09:48.287 --> 09:49.422
SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.924
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.059
&gt;&gt; HEY, KYLA.

09:53.125 --> 09:53.960
&gt;&gt; OH, HI TRUE.

09:55.094 --> 09:55.828
&gt;&gt; HE HAD TO LEAVE EARLY

09:55.895 --> 09:56.729
TO GO TO REHEARSAL.

09:56.796 --> 09:57.563
&gt;&gt; OH, REALLY?

09:57.630 --> 09:58.798
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO WITH HIM?

09:58.864 --> 10:00.433
&gt;&gt; I GOT DETENTION.

10:00.499 --> 10:02.101
APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT OKAY

10:02.168 --> 10:03.836
TO SPIN-KICK THE HALL MONITOR,

10:03.903 --> 10:06.072
NO MATTER HOW OBNOXIOUS HE IS.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.106
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MARSH McCALL.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.107
HE'S A BIT OF A DOOF.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.041
&gt;&gt; WELL, NOW HE'S A DOOF

10:09.108 --> 10:11.043
WITH A FOOTPRINT ON HIS FACE.

10:11.110 --> 10:11.811
&gt;&gt; I REALLY WISH

10:11.877 --> 10:12.345
JUSTIN WAS HERE.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.045
YOU DON'T KNOW

10:13.112 --> 10:13.779
HOW MUCH I LOOK FORWARD

10:13.846 --> 10:14.914
TO SEEING HIM EVERY DAY.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.614
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE

10:15.681 --> 10:16.349
I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

10:16.415 --> 10:17.183
AND EVERYTHING IS GRAY,

10:17.249 --> 10:18.918
BUT THE SECOND I SEE HIM, BAM!

10:18.985 --> 10:19.752
HELLO SUNSHINE.

10:19.819 --> 10:20.653
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY DROPPED

10:20.720 --> 10:21.821
A HOUSE ON THE WITCH!

10:21.887 --> 10:22.555
&gt;&gt; TRUE...

10:22.621 --> 10:23.289
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF IT'S TOO SOON

10:23.356 --> 10:24.223
TO INTRODUCE HIM TO MY PARENTS

10:24.290 --> 10:25.558
EVEN THOUGH MY DAD WILL BE ALL,

10:25.624 --> 10:26.892
"NO TRUE, HE'S A RAPPER.

10:26.959 --> 10:27.560
"HE'S PROBABLY GOT

10:27.626 --> 10:28.694
"THUG" WRITTEN ON HIS BELLY!"

10:28.761 --> 10:30.296
&gt;&gt; TRUE.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.097
IF I WERE YOU,

10:31.163 --> 10:31.831
I MIGHT WANNA TAKE THINGS

10:31.897 --> 10:34.000
A LITTLE SLOWER WITH JUSTIN.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.101
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD I WANNA DO THAT?

10:35.167 --> 10:36.035
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUSTIN'S GOING

10:36.102 --> 10:38.738
ON TOUR NEXT MONTH.

10:38.804 --> 10:39.505
HE'LL PROBABLY BE GONE

10:39.572 --> 10:49.081
TILL THE END OF THE YEAR.

10:49.148 --> 10:53.252
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

10:53.319 --> 10:54.186
&gt;&gt; HEY, TRUE.

10:54.253 --> 10:54.920
&gt;&gt; HEY, JIMMY.

10:54.987 --> 10:55.654
&gt;&gt; SO I GOT SOME

10:55.721 --> 10:56.722
EXCITING NEWS TODAY.

10:56.789 --> 10:57.823
I FOUND OUT THAT I'M A FINALIST

10:57.890 --> 10:59.125
FOR A BIG POSTAL INTERNSHIP

10:59.191 --> 11:00.026
IN D.C.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.594
&gt;&gt; WOW, THAT'S COOL.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.962
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT IF I GET IT,

11:03.029 --> 11:03.729
IT MEANS I'D BE GONE

11:03.796 --> 11:04.764
FOR TWO WHOLE YEARS.

11:04.830 --> 11:05.664
&gt;&gt; TWO WHOLE YEARS?

11:05.731 --> 11:06.332
WHO'S GONNA TRY OUT

11:06.399 --> 11:07.233
THE TERRIBLE NEW RESTAURANTS

11:07.299 --> 11:08.067
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

11:08.134 --> 11:09.502
LIKE THAT GROSS FISH PLACE.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.703
&gt;&gt; YESTERDAY'S FISH?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.238
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.874
IT HAD A LOT OF BATHROOMS.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.674
&gt;&gt; STILL, IT WON'T BE

11:15.741 --> 11:16.776
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

11:16.842 --> 11:17.610
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

11:17.676 --> 11:18.577
IF I HAVE IT YET.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.346
HANK SAYS IT'S REALLY POLITICAL.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.747
&gt;&gt; WELL, IF YOU REALLY WANT IT,

11:21.814 --> 11:22.681
I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED

11:22.748 --> 11:23.282
FOR YOU.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.152
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.019
&gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE WONDERING

11:27.086 --> 11:28.421
WHY SOMEONE WITH MY TALENTS

11:28.487 --> 11:30.356
ISN'T RULING MY OWN EMPIRE.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.091
WELL, THERE'S NO SHAME

11:32.158 --> 11:33.426
IN BEING SECOND IN COMMAND.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.594
IN FACT, MAX MADIGAN OFTEN SAYS

11:35.661 --> 11:36.629
THAT WHEN HE THINKS

11:36.695 --> 11:39.165
OF NUMBER TWO, HE THINKS OF ME.

11:39.231 --> 11:40.499
&gt;&gt; PSSSST.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.200
&gt;&gt; I'M REMINDED

11:41.267 --> 11:42.902
OF MY EARLY DAYS IN FASHION.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.503
THE SMELLS, THE EXCITEMENT...

11:44.570 --> 11:45.104
&gt;&gt; PSSSST.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.205
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.406
&gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT BOY I LIKE?

11:47.473 --> 11:48.140
&gt;&gt; NO.

11:48.207 --> 11:48.808
&gt;&gt; THE ONE I MENTIONED

11:48.874 --> 11:49.408
IN THE STAFF MEETING?

11:49.475 --> 11:50.342
RIGHT BEFORE YOU LOST CONTROL

11:50.409 --> 11:51.043
AND STARTED SCREAMING

11:51.110 --> 11:53.946
THAT NOBODY TAKES YOU SERIOUSLY?

11:54.013 --> 11:55.114
&gt;&gt; TAKE A FIVER, BOYS.

11:55.181 --> 11:55.981
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T DO THAT.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.249
&gt;&gt; DO YOU EAT YOUR OWN TEETH?

11:57.316 --> 12:02.321
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.457
ALL RIGHT, MOPPET, SPILL.

12:07.059 --> 12:07.626
KISS ANOTHER GIRL?

12:07.693 --> 12:09.295

12:09.361 --> 12:10.196

ESPECIALLY AFTER HE SENT ME

19:51.423 --> 19:52.791
THOSE FLOWERS.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.692
