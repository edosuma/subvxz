WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:03.635
You're giving up on the case?

00:03.703 --> 00:05.804
I'm not giving up.
There is no case.

00:05.872 --> 00:08.573
The court rules in favour of
the motion to strike.

00:08.642 --> 00:12.110
The case is dismissed.
<i>My stepdad used to call</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:15.313
David Hanley the Grim Reaper.
My ex is moving.

00:15.316 --> 00:18.950
He's got a job in Winnipeg.
Our marriage was terrible,

00:19.019 --> 00:22.487
but we're great at coparenting.
I can count on him.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.257
All you need to do is sign this.

00:25.325 --> 00:28.160
- A nondisclosure agreement?
<i>- My dad's sins</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:30.662
caught up to him.
That's why we left.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.764
If he finds out
I'm talking to you, I'm dead.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.067
Just give me
something I can use.

00:35.135 --> 00:37.936
<i>Southvale Farms, you gotta
go back. Take a closer look.</i>

00:42.476 --> 00:44.709
- So why are we here?
- We have to find out

00:44.778 --> 00:46.945
exactly what's in the ground
that made Amanda and Steve sick

00:46.947 --> 00:48.947
without attracting
any attention.

00:49.015 --> 00:50.949
And how exactly do we do that?

00:51.017 --> 00:52.951
Ground penetrating radar.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.554
I paid for law school
working summers for Jack's crew.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.657
We'd see the pipe lines before
we even picked up a shovel.

00:58.725 --> 01:02.494
Jack. Thanks for meeting
with us.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.361
You're going
to have to make this quick.

01:04.431 --> 01:06.231
We're already behind
on this job.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.366
- We need a utility scanner.
- We don't think

01:08.435 --> 01:10.368
that the athletic field
is the only place

01:10.437 --> 01:12.904
where Matheson Steel dumped.
You really think

01:12.907 --> 01:15.006
Ben knowingly did this?

01:15.075 --> 01:18.077
We need to find out for sure.
For Georgia.

01:22.282 --> 01:24.983
Hey! Luna, let me get that.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.985
- I got it.
- We don't know

01:27.053 --> 01:29.354
what's in this water.
Well, I wasn't gonna drink it.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.189
Look, this has
been disproportionately

01:31.192 --> 01:34.025
affecting young women. I don't
want you this close to it.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.028
Thank you.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.803
Damn it.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.872
Jack, you find anything
over there?

01:46.874 --> 01:50.008
- Nothing yet.
- Where does

01:50.077 --> 01:52.444
this property end, exactly?
20 feet over that hill.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.546
Then you're into the buffer:

01:54.548 --> 01:56.381
The noman's land
between my property

01:56.449 --> 01:58.283
and the neighbour's.
Nobody owns it.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.026 --> 02:42.227
OK.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.597
That makes 23.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.466
That's a lot.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.601
This is way bigger
than we thought.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.469
We need to get these samples
tested right away.

02:51.472 --> 02:54.673
If it tests positive for benzene, then
we have a good chance at certification.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.342
Before we can
have a class action,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.177
we have to ask the court
to certify.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.290
Certification determines...
Whether the proceeding should

03:01.314 --> 03:03.815
be appropriately prosecuted
as a class proceeding.

03:03.883 --> 03:05.984
Very good.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.819
Certification is leverage,

03:07.821 --> 03:10.488
which gives us bargaining power
when we try to settle.

03:10.557 --> 03:14.259
- So that's our goal? Settling?
- I know it doesn't sound

03:14.327 --> 03:16.695
like a win,
but if we go to trial,

03:16.763 --> 03:20.432
then it's 21 that we lose.
And then we get nothing.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
23 barrels in the field,

03:22.569 --> 03:24.770
and we still can't tie it
to Matheson Steel.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.239
- But our whistleblower can.
- Nate Dawson?

03:27.307 --> 03:29.975
He's no help to us
unless he signs an affidavit

03:30.043 --> 03:31.977
before the hearing.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.312
I'm supposed to meet with him
in a few minutes.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.381
Well, you better get going then.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.985
Luna, you can help me
amend our argument.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.654
All right!

03:56.803 --> 03:59.137
Morning.

04:04.377 --> 04:06.211
You're still here.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.813
Aren't you late for work?
I called in sick.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.683
I thought maybe we
could sleep in,

04:11.685 --> 04:13.485
watch a movie in bed.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.087
I have a job.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.225
What's going on?

04:20.293 --> 04:23.395
- Nothing.
- Spill it.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.504
I... I didn't sign up for this.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.242
I can't make a difference
from the copy room.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.978
Mercer's making my life
a living hell.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.584
But you think he's on the take.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.585
Yeah. What do you
want me to do? Confront him

04:47.654 --> 04:49.521
about a new set of golf clubs?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.259
Would you ever...

04:54.328 --> 04:56.328
consider going back to Winnipeg?

04:56.396 --> 04:58.730
I think I'd consider
everything else first.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.936
Then...

05:04.938 --> 05:06.938
as far as I can see, you don't

05:07.006 --> 05:08.940
have any option
but to settle your differences.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.209
I can't work

05:11.278 --> 05:13.511
with someone who picks

05:13.580 --> 05:15.447
and chooses who he serves
and protects.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.954
Be the better man,

05:22.956 --> 05:24.956
so you can get back out there

05:25.024 --> 05:27.092
and protect the ones he won't.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.942
Wow.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.044
Cozy.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.313
Joanna's not here.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.515
Unless you're looking
to go another few rounds?

05:52.485 --> 05:54.319
I come in peace.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.254
What did you have in mind?

05:56.256 --> 05:58.656
Actually...

05:58.725 --> 06:01.926
Matheson Steel has authorized me
to make a settlement offer.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.928
Really?

06:03.931 --> 06:07.665
$2 million, but only
for the named plaintiff.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.402
- Molly.
- That's right.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.405
It is an exclusive offer.
One that I would like to discuss

06:13.473 --> 06:15.473
with her legal counsel
in private, please.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.475
Give us a minute.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.113
OK. Fine.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.321
You can't make an offer
only to Molly.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.290
I already did.
I'm actually surprised

06:32.359 --> 06:34.960
that you're not more excited
that I just brought

06:35.028 --> 06:36.961
this generous offer
to your niece.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.797
I won't cut the other girls out.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.332
Court won't allow it.
Forget about the court.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.302
My client is gonna
give Molly $2 million,

06:44.304 --> 06:46.772
and you just have to convince
the others to drop the suit.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.908
Billy, your sister,

06:49.910 --> 06:51.843
your niece...

06:51.845 --> 06:53.945
they will be set for life...

06:54.013 --> 06:57.716
or we'll crush you at trial.
We have new evidence.

06:57.784 --> 07:01.052
How long are you
gonna keep fighting?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.054
As long as it takes.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.590
You got the bills.
They're already piling up,

07:05.659 --> 07:07.459
and if I know Joanna,
she's probably hired

07:07.527 --> 07:09.928
the best scientists,
expert doctors...

07:09.996 --> 07:12.697
and you're the one
who's squeezing the space

07:12.765 --> 07:15.400
on the credit card.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.137
$2 million for Molly.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.007
We'll give you 100 grand.
We walk away.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.075
Out of the question.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.211
Why? Because it's unethical?

07:26.213 --> 07:28.680
That didn't stop you
with Houghton Hills.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.487
Yeah.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.056
We do our homework.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.291
Does your cocounsel know
about your little gaffe?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.171
You're not gonna blackmail me
into taking this offer.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.095
Maybe not...

07:44.164 --> 07:46.431
but as your niece's
legal counsel,

07:46.433 --> 07:49.067
you are obligated to take her
all settlement offers.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.072
Let's see what she has
to say to $2 million.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.291
Taylor?

08:13.359 --> 08:15.927
What're you doing?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.063
Just getting used
to not going anywhere.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.199
Honey...

08:21.268 --> 08:23.635
Court?

08:23.703 --> 08:26.771
- Work first, then...
- I should

08:26.839 --> 08:28.840
be there with the girls.
Sweetheart,

08:28.908 --> 08:30.775
we spoke about this.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.477
I can't have
my own child suing me.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.780
Joanna said that we're not
suing you. We're suing the mill.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.783
I am the mill...

08:38.851 --> 08:40.717
for better or for worse, honey.
So are you.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.522
You... you don't remember
having this conversation?

08:45.825 --> 08:47.659
I...

08:47.727 --> 08:49.961
I remember you used
to want me to go off

08:50.029 --> 08:52.297
and get a law degree,

08:52.365 --> 08:55.333
come back and...
learn the steel business.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.435
"Not enough strong women

08:57.503 --> 08:59.270
"in steel, but Taylor...

08:59.339 --> 09:01.306
you can change that."

09:01.374 --> 09:03.808
- Well, you still can.
- Yeah.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.643
Me and the hole in my brain will

09:05.712 --> 09:07.523
take the steel world by storm.
All right. Listen, honey.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.447
Um...

09:09.515 --> 09:11.816
I'm your father, and you're
gonna let me take care of you.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.319
Now, we have
some money set aside.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.722
We have nothing to worry about.
What about my friends?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.697
Right. That's what I thought.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.079
- How much did she tell you?
- Just the...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.281
$2 million part.
Luna, seriously, you cannot...

09:43.283 --> 09:46.017
You kicked me out, OK?
I got bored.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.987
That's a...
That's a lot of money.

09:49.055 --> 09:51.756
Just think about what we could
do with that.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.658
The places we could go,
the things we could buy.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.760
We could get a boat.

09:55.828 --> 09:57.862
OK, or we could get a house.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.864
This money has
to last my whole life.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.833
Fine, so let's get a houseboat
and become pirates.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.302
Yes! And then we'll
save the rest.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.371
Lisa's dad can teach me
how to make the money last

10:06.373 --> 10:08.907
because he's a CPA.
Have you told her yet?

10:08.975 --> 10:10.842
No.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.511
Why not?

10:13.579 --> 10:16.047
Because the offer
is only for you.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.218
You're the named plaintiff.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.186
They wanna

10:22.189 --> 10:24.489
pay you and convince the others
to drop the suit.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.158
I would get rich,
and the others...

10:27.226 --> 10:29.894
would get nothing?

10:53.686 --> 10:56.021
I'd like to depose you.

10:56.089 --> 10:59.557
Have you sign an affidavit
so we can use it in court.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.559
You want me to go on the record?

11:01.627 --> 11:04.495
I'll lose my job, my pension.
That is a risk,

11:04.498 --> 11:07.966
but without you,
we may lose this case.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.271
And nobody gets nothing?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.848
I already pointed you
to where the barrels were.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.184
That should be enough.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.619
In cases like this, it's...

11:28.688 --> 11:31.122
it's never quite enough.

11:32.759 --> 11:36.127
The people in this town,
they talk.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.663
I don't wanna be remembered
as the guy who killed the mill

11:38.731 --> 11:41.466
in a place called Millwood.
To these girls, you'd be

11:41.534 --> 11:43.635
remembered as the guy
who did the right thing.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.545
<i>Alan came to me
with a settlement offer.</i>

11:54.548 --> 11:56.547
Only for Molly.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.183
How much?

11:59.252 --> 12:02.087
- 2 mill.
- What'd she say?

12:02.155 --> 12:05.723
She's thinking about it.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.892
- What'd you tell her?
- As her lawyer,

12:07.960 --> 12:10.161
to turn it down.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.163
- And as her uncle?
- These things

12:12.231 --> 12:14.099
can go on forever.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.134
Look at the Love Canal.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.136
I don't want her life to be over

12:18.204 --> 12:22.006
before she ever sees a dime...
if she ever sees a dime.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.242
Billy, this is good news.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.314
If they're willing
to make an offer to Molly,

12:30.317 --> 12:32.161
then they're willing to deal
with all the girls.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.986
Exactly.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.523
I need to talk to you.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.825
- She knows.
- Good...

12:40.893 --> 12:43.294
then you can both hear this.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.563
I thought about it.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.337
I can't take the money.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.672
It isn't right.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.375
We all get paid
or none of us do.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.205
I've missed you at home.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.276
I've been working on the case.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.649
I know you're
testing your wings,

13:37.717 --> 13:39.818
taking time on your own, but...

13:41.721 --> 13:43.387
we only have
a few months left together

13:43.390 --> 13:45.590
before you move to Montreal.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.092
Could we...

13:48.160 --> 13:50.495
try to be a family
a little longer?

13:52.932 --> 13:54.799
Why did you lie to me about him?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.905
Who is it
you think I lied about?

14:00.973 --> 14:04.008
David Hanley.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.514
Some things...

14:12.686 --> 14:15.620
Some things I hope
you never have to understand.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.289
So you let me figure them out
on my own.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.426
- I was trying to protect you!
- Yeah, you have a funny way of showing it.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.262
It hurts so much

14:24.330 --> 14:26.197
to be abandoned
by someone you love.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.666
And if you thought

14:28.734 --> 14:30.802
it was just my fault...

14:32.639 --> 14:34.439
just a onetime thing.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.908
I wanted you to grow up
with the confidence

14:36.976 --> 14:38.943
that your dad leaving

14:39.011 --> 14:41.612
had nothing to do with you.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.649
You understand me?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.452
Nothing!

14:51.891 --> 14:54.492
Does it ever get easier?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.864
We have each other.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.367
We're pretty great.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.739
Come here.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.814
Will you please come home?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.252
Yeah.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.030
- So what do we ask for?
- The conventional rule

15:32.098 --> 15:34.899
is never be the first one to say
a number. But me, I go big.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.335
So just how much

15:37.403 --> 15:39.203
is a life worth?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.172
Worst case scenario, these girls

15:41.240 --> 15:43.174
are never able
to support themselves.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.612
Worst case.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.985
Joanna.

15:54.053 --> 15:56.988
What a nice surprise.
At a negotiation meeting?

15:57.056 --> 15:59.757
These are my clients too.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.597
$5 million per girl.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.566
Upfront.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.702
OK. Let's get right into it.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.273
Joanna, this is
a small town steel mill.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.275
You can't expect them
to have that kind of money

16:18.278 --> 16:21.279
just kicking around. Yeah, but
their parent company does.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.581
P and I did 1.2 billion
in revenue last year.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.550
Yeah, but you're
not suing P and I.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.418
You can't pierce the corporate
veil and prove that they

16:27.420 --> 16:30.021
had any knowledge
of your... allegations.

16:30.089 --> 16:33.257
- You don't know that.
- OK, so what's your counter?

16:33.325 --> 16:36.294
2 million... total
paid out over the next 20 years.

16:36.362 --> 16:39.697
You really think
the livelihood of six girls

16:39.766 --> 16:42.566
is worth that little?
It's five girls.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.403
Taylor Matheson's no longer part
of your class proceedings.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.638
Either way,

16:47.640 --> 16:50.141
that offer is too low.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.012
Samples from our new evidence

16:55.081 --> 16:57.582
tested positive for benzene.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.019
We're confident in our prospects
should this go to trial.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.991
More unproven allegations.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.594
We have someone
who is willing to testify

17:09.662 --> 17:12.329
that they were dumped there
by your client.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.865
Who?

17:14.934 --> 17:16.867
1 million per girl

17:16.869 --> 17:19.037
paid out over 5 years.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.409
[I told you the offer
was only for the Ross girl,

17:25.478 --> 17:28.212
I know, but...

17:28.281 --> 17:30.548
they're willing to talk,
and I looked at the numbers.

17:37.523 --> 17:40.324
Alan, the offer
was supposed to divide them.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.604
You haven't done that. Instead,
you've weakened our position.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.329
I stand by my play.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.965
Ä°t was the wrong one?
Look, all due respect,

17:48.034 --> 17:50.968
if they certify their class,
their ask will be double.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.970
Apparently, they have

17:53.038 --> 17:55.739
a new find... eyewitness.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.708
To the dumping of barrels?

17:59.779 --> 18:03.381
- Fabulous.
- The evidence is starting

18:03.449 --> 18:05.916
to fall less in our favour.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.052
We'll destroy them
in certification.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.421
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.542
I'm sorry. I can't
make those numbers work.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.912
You say hi to my father for me?

18:34.980 --> 18:37.948
You know, if you two would just talk,
it would make this a lot simpler.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.418
Nothing is simple
with my father.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.087
Job before personal.
Didn't you teach me that?

18:43.155 --> 18:45.590
- You're going to regret this.
- I already do.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.760
See you in chambers.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.407
- Come on.
- I've been trying

19:03.475 --> 19:05.075
to get in touch with you.
Yeah, well,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.278
coffee time is my time.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.146
Besides, I don't recall
clearing you for duty.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.382
Look...

19:11.384 --> 19:13.918
with everything
that's going on...

19:13.986 --> 19:16.587
the town's been
turned upsidedown,

19:16.656 --> 19:18.656
and so have I.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.891
That's your apology?

19:20.960 --> 19:23.327
You need me back out
on the street.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.207
No, not if you're getting
in the way of honest folks

19:25.231 --> 19:27.298
looking out for themselves.
I get it.

19:27.366 --> 19:30.935
My stepdad worked
the mill 43 years.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.271
He bled steel
until the day he died.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.975
The town comes first.
You have my word.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.546
OK, then.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.382
Get in. You're riding
with me today.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.166
- Great.
- Thank you.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.368
See you later.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.370
Foreman said
you wanted to see me?

20:06.438 --> 20:08.172
Yeah.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.842
Jeez, are you...
feeling OK, Nate?

20:11.911 --> 20:14.245
I guess so. Did I
do something wrong?

20:14.313 --> 20:16.847
Man, we go back

20:16.915 --> 20:19.516
a long way, Nate, so let's not
beat around the bush.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.486
I think we owe each other that.
OK. Yeah.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.990
My lawyers tell me
that I have a problem.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.193
- What kind of problem?
- Well, it seems

20:29.195 --> 20:31.362
that somebody
who works here has been...

20:31.430 --> 20:34.232
talking to the other side.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.335
Are you accusing me?

20:38.338 --> 20:41.672
No, no, no.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.874
Accusing's for lawyers, Nate.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.876
I'm just a working guy like you.

20:45.944 --> 20:48.479
'Cause I don't know
anything about that.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.481
Yeah, well, the thing is that
there's only a handful of people

20:50.483 --> 20:51.882
that it could be.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.884
And I'm one of them?

20:53.953 --> 20:56.887
But you're the only one
of them that I trust.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.956
Nate, I need to get

20:59.025 --> 21:01.659
to the bottom of this.
My baby girl is sick.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.661
They're coming after
my business.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.264
They're coming after me.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.934
I wish I could help you.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.903
Well, you can.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.773
And you will.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.042
I need you to talk

21:18.110 --> 21:20.611
to every man you used
on those runs.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.713
And tell them what, exactly?

21:22.715 --> 21:25.349
Well, you tell them
to be careful.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
And if they are and...

21:29.388 --> 21:31.455
and they do right

21:31.524 --> 21:33.691
then this can all
go back to normal.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.529
I'm gonna figure it out
one way or another, Nate.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.531
All right. Get back in.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.544
<i>Hi.</i>

21:53.612 --> 21:56.513
Your mom let me in,
but if you're busy, I can...

21:56.582 --> 21:58.393
No, no! That's OK. You can
help me pick out what to wear

21:58.417 --> 22:00.284
to court. My uncle told me

22:00.352 --> 22:02.619
to look smart...

22:02.688 --> 22:05.289
but I have no idea

22:05.291 --> 22:07.291
what that means.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.561
- You should wear this.
- Yeah.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.397
It's either that
or a pair of tearaways,

22:13.465 --> 22:15.232
so that'll have to do.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.605
Are you OK?

22:21.673 --> 22:24.908
Yeah, I'm just...
I haven't been feeling

22:24.911 --> 22:27.344
really great lately.
I wonder why?

22:27.413 --> 22:30.247
Yeah. I'll be fine though.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.918
I just want this to be...
over, you know?

22:33.986 --> 22:36.921
Yeah, but my uncle says
these things can take years.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.989
I'm not a part
of the suit. Remember?

22:38.991 --> 22:42.126
- What?
- I texted you this morning.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.896
- No...
- Or... yesterday?

22:45.964 --> 22:49.333
I... I swear I did. I...

22:49.335 --> 22:51.268
Well, does my uncle know?

22:51.337 --> 22:53.604
I don't know.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.673
My dad begged me

22:55.741 --> 22:57.675
to pull myself out of it, so...
What?!

22:57.743 --> 22:59.710
That's bull! I'm sorry,

22:59.778 --> 23:01.712
but you're 18!
You can do what you want.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.383
What do you want?

23:06.452 --> 23:10.053
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.022
I can't imagine

23:12.091 --> 23:14.057
how complicated all this
must be for you.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.695
I just want you to know that...

23:18.698 --> 23:22.199
whatever you decide,
I'm with you.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.438
Are you OK?

23:30.709 --> 23:33.010
My God! Taylor?

23:33.078 --> 23:36.413
Most likely, she fainted from
the stress of the situation.

23:36.482 --> 23:38.382
I keep telling you girls

23:38.451 --> 23:40.217
to take it easy.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.554
Can stress also
cause memory loss?

23:43.556 --> 23:45.856
Stress can do pretty much
anything under the sun...

23:47.726 --> 23:50.194
but her white blood cell
count is elevated.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.363
- What does that mean?
- We'll do

23:52.431 --> 23:54.164
more blood work
to rule some things out.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.934
Thank you.

23:56.936 --> 24:00.471
Don't worry. Doctors make
everything sound scary.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.406
I'm not scared.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.911
Well, you are certainly
braver than me.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.553
Don't worry.

24:18.090 --> 24:21.358
This'll all be over soon.
I promise.

24:30.502 --> 24:32.436
I don't think this deposition

24:32.505 --> 24:34.872
is a good idea. It's not safe.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.773
- We can protect you.
- No, you can't.

24:36.776 --> 24:40.143
Matheson knows. He confronted
me. I gotta get out of here.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.557
- No. He's probably bluffing.
- No, he's not. I'm telling you,

24:42.581 --> 24:44.915
he knows I came to you.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.251
- And we're grateful for that.
- Look, I gave you

24:47.319 --> 24:49.787
everything I got. I don't know
what else you want from me.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.724
- We want your testimony.
- I can't do it.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.559
Nate... Nate!

24:55.627 --> 24:57.394
I'm sorry.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.333
<i>I wish we had the girls here.</i>

25:03.402 --> 25:05.435
We don't need them.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.038
I think it helps.
Judges in this circuit,

25:08.106 --> 25:10.440
they like to see faces.
It's more personal.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.276
Well, it would help
to see them twitching.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.680
I'm not saying that they
should exaggerate it,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.615
but it wouldn't hurt us.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.484
We'll just have
to stick to the facts.

25:20.553 --> 25:23.020
I would feel much more
confident in those facts if we

25:23.088 --> 25:25.199
had signed affidavit from Nate.
They don't need to know

25:25.223 --> 25:27.124
that we don't.
They're gonna find out.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.093
Not before we win certification.

25:29.161 --> 25:32.763
We're gonna bluff.
Once we have certification,

25:32.765 --> 25:35.099
we'll be in a better position
to negotiate.

25:35.167 --> 25:38.168
It's not against the rules.
You'll be OK.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.838
When I was at RossMcCann...

25:43.709 --> 25:45.476
I broke a rule.

25:48.447 --> 25:50.380
You?

25:50.383 --> 25:53.384
I was suspended for violating
my professional ethics.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.387
That's why I left the firm.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.356
I wasn't fired, I just...

25:59.424 --> 26:02.793
came back here,
tail between my legs.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.496
What'd you do?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.133
I took a gift
from the other side in exchange

26:10.136 --> 26:12.102
for a lower sum.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.504
You're lucky you didn't
get disbarred.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.640
It was my first year.

26:16.708 --> 26:19.743
I was young in a big city
for the first time.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.479
I was an easy mark.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.217
I took 10% off the ask.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.153
What'd they give you?

26:29.221 --> 26:31.822
A trip to Vegas.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.857
I'm sorry.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.226
Hey, I'd never been
anywhere before.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.567
CTS knows and they're trying
to use it against me.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.636
I just needed you to know.

26:45.704 --> 26:47.904
Don't worry.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.273
I know a lot about them.

26:50.342 --> 26:54.211
Come on, Mr. Vegas.
Let's go bluff.

27:19.971 --> 27:22.006
There you go.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.110
Thanks for buying lunch.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.581
You'll have to tell me
your secret.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.084
Secret?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.219
What do you mean by that?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.222
Nothing.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.432
Listen...

27:48.434 --> 27:51.034
I know a cop in this town
can only make so much,

27:51.037 --> 27:54.004
and we all have ends
we gotta meet.

27:54.072 --> 27:57.675
You keep this conversation going, I'll
show you where you meet your end.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.413
Relax!

28:05.251 --> 28:07.128
I won big last week
playing poker. You know what?

28:07.152 --> 28:09.386
I almost felt bad taking
all of McCurdy's money.

28:09.454 --> 28:11.655
Almost.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.857
It's all good.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.859
We both do our jobs.
You do it your way.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.761
I do it my way.
At the end of the day,

28:17.829 --> 28:19.596
we're both good cops.

28:22.268 --> 28:25.368
You don't think
I'm a good cop, Owen?

28:25.437 --> 28:27.204
The young,

28:27.206 --> 28:29.273
eagertoplease officer.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.219
You were so good at blending in,
blue eyes. What happened?

28:31.243 --> 28:33.610
Sir...

28:33.612 --> 28:35.746
If you got something
you wanna accuse me of,

28:35.814 --> 28:38.148
I'd rather you just say it
to my face already.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.517
I think you accept

28:40.585 --> 28:42.419
extravagant gifts
to look the other way.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.624
And that eagertoplease officer
you're talking about?

28:47.692 --> 28:50.927
He's been biting a hole
in his lip the entire time

28:50.996 --> 28:54.198
trying to stomach your
smallminded, racist bullshit.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.869
I can't do it anymore.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.746
We have done extensive testing
of the girls' athletic field

29:09.749 --> 29:12.316
at Millwood High
and the surrounding area

29:12.384 --> 29:14.584
at Southvale Farms.
We have a witness who can link

29:14.587 --> 29:17.454
both the barrels... Your Honour,
the plaintiff's counsel

29:17.523 --> 29:19.389
has not submitted
an affidavit for any witness.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.159
Defence is correct.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.562
Please confine your arguments
to submitted materials.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.267
If you will turn to
the submitted soil sample tests,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.936
the chromatogram
yielded identical

29:33.004 --> 29:34.771
chemical footprints
for both the field

29:34.840 --> 29:37.174
and the area surrounding
Matheson Steel Mill.

29:37.242 --> 29:40.244
Your Honour,
plaintiff's counsel is trying

29:40.312 --> 29:42.479
to establish fault at a
certification hearing.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.982
We request it be struck.
I am merely trying to assess

29:45.050 --> 29:48.251
commonalities, and the defence
is trying to stall.

29:48.320 --> 29:52.055
Please keep your interjections
relevant. You'll have your turn.

29:52.124 --> 29:56.426
- We have no further arguments.
- Your Honour,

29:56.494 --> 29:59.229
the allegations are based on
improper medical science.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.731
There is no discernable proof.
In fact,

30:01.800 --> 30:05.235
volumes of contrary medical
literature indicate no link

30:05.304 --> 30:07.571
between benzene
and any of the symptoms

30:07.639 --> 30:09.773
characterized by the plaintiff.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.608
None of these "medical volumes"

30:11.676 --> 30:13.577
have been submitted
to the court.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.580
Stick to the materials
you submitted, Counsellor.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.883
Your Honour, the plaintiff
has shown no direct link

30:19.951 --> 30:21.852
between the benzene
found in the field

30:21.920 --> 30:25.989
and my client's mill.
Further, certification should be

30:25.991 --> 30:28.158
held to higher standards
to avoid an onslaught

30:28.160 --> 30:30.927
of frivolous litigation.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.330
Are you finished?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.332
Yeah.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.970
Given the specificity
of the symptoms,

30:40.038 --> 30:42.839
and the applicants' established

30:42.908 --> 30:45.408
and equal use
of the athletic field,

30:45.477 --> 30:47.611
the requirements
for commonalities

30:47.679 --> 30:49.580
has been satisfied.

30:49.648 --> 30:52.115
Certification is granted.
You may proceed

30:52.183 --> 30:54.751
as a class action.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.229
She seems to be
doing much better.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.165
My friends came to visit.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.667
Taylor, we need to talk.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.271
- That doesn't sound good.
- What's going on?

31:14.339 --> 31:16.773
Her bloodwork's come back

31:16.841 --> 31:19.643
and I would like to do
a bone marrow biopsy.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.045
What does that mean?

31:22.114 --> 31:24.381
You think she has leukemia?

31:26.251 --> 31:28.585
I'd rather not
jump to conclusions.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.121
That's not a no.

31:31.189 --> 31:33.056
I don't understand.

31:33.124 --> 31:35.592
I have cancer?

31:35.661 --> 31:37.627
Sweetheart.

31:37.696 --> 31:40.130
It's too early to say,

31:40.198 --> 31:44.000
but all the signs are pointing
in that direction.

31:44.003 --> 31:47.470
Leukemia is genetic, right?

31:47.473 --> 31:49.973
Typically, but it is
known to develop

31:50.041 --> 31:52.476
from exposure to radiation...

31:52.544 --> 31:54.544
or toxic materials.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.284
Given her age
and medical history,

32:00.352 --> 32:02.319
if it is leukemia, her prognosis

32:02.387 --> 32:05.155
is still quite good.
It seems early enough

32:05.223 --> 32:07.157
that chemotherapy
followed by radiation

32:07.225 --> 32:09.559
would be a strong first step,
but let's not

32:09.628 --> 32:11.628
get ahead of ourselves.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.297
I know this is a lot to digest.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.767
I'll give you
some time together.

32:33.652 --> 32:35.629
I have been saving this
for something special, but...

32:35.653 --> 32:38.722
you know, I can't think of
anything more special than this.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.591
You should save it
for when we win the case.

32:41.659 --> 32:43.927
You are such
a buzzkill sometimes.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.795
It's a big win, Billy,

32:45.864 --> 32:47.797
but it's just a checkmark.
See? Buzzkill.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.067
You know, growing up, I learned

32:51.070 --> 32:52.703
to celebrate checkmarks.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.539
That's why they call me
"PartMarks" Crawford.

32:55.607 --> 32:59.075
You know, this whole
selfdeprecating, smalltown

32:59.144 --> 33:00.877
dumb guy routine?

33:00.946 --> 33:02.812
I'm not buying it.

33:02.815 --> 33:06.316
You should go back to
a big firm, give it another try.

33:06.384 --> 33:08.752
Don't let one mistake stop you.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.820
No, I'm not cut out for that.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.756
You saved us today.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.092
That was nothing.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.129
That was not nothing.

33:19.197 --> 33:20.964
To not nothing.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.441
You guys
are celebrating already?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.144
Would you like some?
It's no ice wine, but...

33:34.212 --> 33:35.845
It's only a checkmark.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.881
Yes, but it is a checkmark

33:37.949 --> 33:39.850
next to our names and not yours.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.720
You argued well today.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.922
- What do you want?
- Well, I just think,

33:45.924 --> 33:47.724
given the circumstances,
we should...

33:47.793 --> 33:49.592
resume negotiation.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.995
OK.

33:52.063 --> 33:54.398
We want double.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.200
2 million per girl.
You're joking.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.736
Give me something reasonable.
I'll take it back to my client.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.472
We did. You rejected it.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.107
If you won't take our new offer

34:04.109 --> 34:06.743
to your client, then...
there's nothing to negotiate.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.012
We'll take this to trial.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.214
Then we will
drag this on for years...

34:11.283 --> 34:13.683
and bankrupt you.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.304
Ben.

34:34.371 --> 34:36.505
Miss Hanley.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.842
Ahem. Are you here
to see Taylor?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.045
I'm sorry.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.179
Yeah, well, it's...

34:44.248 --> 34:46.683
It's not definitive, so...

34:48.620 --> 34:50.487
Thank you.

34:50.554 --> 34:53.156
If there's anything
that we can do...

34:53.224 --> 34:56.893
You could drop the case.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.665
Wait a minute.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.035
You didn't come here
to see my daughter.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.606
You came here
to speak to your client.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.041
Yes.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.277
In light of the new...

35:14.279 --> 35:17.413
We were hoping
she'd consider rejoining.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.849
And your case gets
bigger and bigger.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.684
Lucky you.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.753
- This is not what we wanted.
- But you'll use it

35:23.821 --> 35:26.523
to your advantage?
She's my client.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.893
And I will protect her
from anyone who hurts her.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.201
Then protect her, Ben.

35:46.044 --> 35:48.044
Hello, Your Honour.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.847
Yes, I understand.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.049
Right now?

35:55.086 --> 35:58.454
Yes, I'm on my way.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.390
Alan.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.336
For a second, I was worried
you were having an exparte

36:02.360 --> 36:04.260
with the judge. Care to explain?

36:04.329 --> 36:06.407
I'm as in the dark as you are.
I got a cryptic call.

36:06.431 --> 36:08.665
I think our judge
is a bit theatrical.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.800
She's a judge in a small town.
This is pretty much

36:10.868 --> 36:13.069
her Super Bowl.
She said opposing counsel

36:13.138 --> 36:15.149
called the meeting. If it
wasn't you, then who did it?

36:15.173 --> 36:17.840
- I did.
- David.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.310
Alan.

36:20.378 --> 36:22.279
We should get in there.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.614
I think we've wasted
enough of the court's time.

36:27.419 --> 36:31.321
Please, have a seat.

36:31.389 --> 36:35.024
Counselor... David Hanley has
brought to my attention

36:35.027 --> 36:37.627
his concerns
of your impartiality.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.497
What are you talking about?

36:40.565 --> 36:43.166
Joanna Hanley was
a partner at CTS

36:43.234 --> 36:45.168
when this whole thing started.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.337
I was partner very briefly
and in name only,

36:47.339 --> 36:49.505
and have since tendered
my resignation.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.841
Your Honour, her partner
position, however brief,

36:51.909 --> 36:54.711
allowed her access to privileged
client information.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.879
The McDonald Estate
v Martin verdict

36:56.948 --> 36:58.848
says that she should be

36:58.916 --> 37:00.783
disqualified as counsel
from these proceedings.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.453
It is your obligation
to disclose any and all

37:03.521 --> 37:05.655
conflicts of interest.
Your Honour,

37:05.724 --> 37:07.924
during my time at CTS,
Matheson Steel

37:07.992 --> 37:10.226
- was not a client.
- Yes...

37:10.295 --> 37:12.795
but P and I Steel was,
and it so happens that they

37:12.864 --> 37:14.797
own Matheson Steel.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.333
Well, that's a bit of a reach.

37:17.336 --> 37:20.036
R. V Neil. Unless I had
actual access

37:20.038 --> 37:22.405
to confidential information
relevant to the current matter,

37:22.407 --> 37:24.207
there is no conflict.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.676
Except R. V Neil was
in regards to cases

37:26.678 --> 37:28.812
that were factually unrelated.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.813
Your Honour,

37:30.882 --> 37:34.284
as an associate,
Joanna oversaw the paperwork

37:34.352 --> 37:36.986
for P and I's acquisition
of Fenn Pulp and Paper.

37:37.055 --> 37:41.658
At that time, she had access
to confidential financial

37:41.726 --> 37:43.660
and organizational records
for P and I

37:43.728 --> 37:46.696
and all of its subsidiaries.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.699
What happened to job
before personal?

37:49.701 --> 37:52.568
Given the circumstances,

37:52.571 --> 37:56.239
I will require
a formal motion hearing

37:56.308 --> 37:59.409
on the impartiality
of Counselor Joanna Hanley.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.779
Until the hearing,
as to the matter

38:02.847 --> 38:05.849
of Ross et al v. Matheson Steel,

38:05.917 --> 38:08.918
Joanna Hanley
is hereby disqualified.

38:08.986 --> 38:12.221
Thank you, Your Honour.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.804
Why'd you wait so long
to play that card?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.650
You don't want a fair fight?
I'm just representing

38:29.674 --> 38:32.208
my client. It's business.
Gerrilyn, Luna?

38:32.276 --> 38:33.988
That just business too?
How many times are we

38:34.012 --> 38:36.046
gonna do this?
What about Erin Carr?

38:42.687 --> 38:44.620
All right. You want
to know the truth?

38:44.623 --> 38:47.423
- Yes.
- OK.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.259
Joanna, your mother was a mess...
Don't you pin this on her!

38:50.328 --> 38:52.128
- That's the truth!
- You cheated!

38:52.196 --> 38:54.030
Yes. Yes, I cheated.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.099
I cheated!

38:56.167 --> 38:58.968
Which one are you talking about?

38:59.036 --> 39:00.770
Gerrilyn.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.905
Gerrilyn was there for me.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.141
When we were together,
everything was simple.

39:05.209 --> 39:07.644
It felt like love. It wasn't.

39:07.712 --> 39:10.913
It... it was a mistake.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.650
You had so many chances
to tell me the truth!

39:13.718 --> 39:20.857
I was ashamed. OK?
I was... I was ashamed.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.860
That's the first honest thing
I've heard from you.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.529
Joanna...

39:26.531 --> 39:28.965
I'm...

39:29.033 --> 39:32.301
I'm really sorry.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.637
Don't. Don't.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.787
Brought you some comfort food.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.833
Nothing says your life's
falling apart like a facefull

39:52.857 --> 39:54.758
of cheese puffs.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.460
Next time, I'll go
with quinoa then.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.799
Are you thinking
about Taylor again?

40:02.867 --> 40:04.767
It just keeps

40:04.836 --> 40:07.036
playing over and...

40:09.040 --> 40:11.040
over in my head.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.710
When she collapsed,

40:13.778 --> 40:15.779
I didn't even know
if she was still alive...

40:15.847 --> 40:18.782
and all I could
think about was...

40:18.850 --> 40:21.384
what if this happens to me?

40:21.453 --> 40:24.754
How selfish is that?

40:24.822 --> 40:27.924
No, not selfish. Just honest.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.462
I'm so tired

40:32.530 --> 40:34.330
and I'm totally
at the mercy of this thing.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.499
At any time,
that could happen to me.

40:36.567 --> 40:39.068
We're not in control
of the illness,

40:39.136 --> 40:41.538
but we can choose
how we're gonna fight it.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.277
I'm gonna defer school
until January.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.213
Luna, you don't have to do that!

40:50.281 --> 40:52.682
I want to. I wanna see

40:52.750 --> 40:54.684
the case through,
and I wanna be here with you.

40:54.686 --> 40:58.187
We'll weather
this storm together.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.356
In our house boat?

41:06.498 --> 41:08.431
I wish you would have called.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.701
You called me, remember?
I told you to end this.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.870
I can't just wave my hand
and make this go away.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.572
No? I just did.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.441
David, you and I both
already knew about this.

41:18.443 --> 41:20.276
Joanna is gonna win her appeal.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.245
You're missing the point.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.981
Listen, you've done a...

41:24.983 --> 41:26.983
fabulous job
getting us this far.

41:27.051 --> 41:28.985
I'll take it from here.

41:29.053 --> 41:32.054
That's unnecessary. I've got
everything under control.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.056
Alan, CTS is
a prestigious law firm.

41:34.125 --> 41:36.158
We have a reputation to protect.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.594
Now, don't take this personally,
but we can't...

41:38.663 --> 41:41.764
be losing motion hearings
to a couple of small town yucks.

41:41.832 --> 41:44.267
You know, all due respect,

41:44.335 --> 41:46.235
that's your daughter
you're talking about.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.204
Joanna's made her decision.

41:48.273 --> 41:51.508
I can't protect her from
herself, and neither can you.

42:12.364 --> 42:15.364
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.200
I jumped in my truck and got
as far as the Duclos bridge.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.503
- I know the place.
- Yeah, the team

42:20.572 --> 42:22.839
used to go there
sometimes after a win.

42:22.907 --> 42:25.174
Drink Slurpees,

42:25.243 --> 42:27.310
toss stones in the river.

42:29.847 --> 42:32.582
I'm not safe here,

42:32.650 --> 42:36.052
but standing on that bridge,
thinking 'bout them...

42:36.120 --> 42:38.454
I will be there
right beside you.

42:38.522 --> 42:41.057
For every step of this.

42:43.461 --> 42:45.328
All right.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.932
Good.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.868
Let's get started.
