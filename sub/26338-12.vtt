WEBVTT

00:08.225 --> 00:11.098
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Where is the map?

00:11.141 --> 00:14.014
See, you already said
that you weren't gonna ask again

00:14.057 --> 00:16.451
the last time that
you asked again.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.369
You look smarter
than your friend.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.066
I mean, I would never say that.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.720
I mean, everyone has their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:24.763 --> 00:27.027
Shut up.
Where is the map?!

00:27.070 --> 00:29.029
All right, all right.
Hold on. Calm down.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.813
Let me ask you a
better question.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.076
How many grenades were on
your vest a second ago?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.599
'Cause I counted three,

00:34.643 --> 00:37.211
but now I only see two.

00:40.344 --> 00:44.044
What my very smart friend
is trying to say is

00:44.087 --> 00:47.786
let us go or no one
leaves this room alive.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.311
Damn straight.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.019
Hey, good work, Boze.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.325
Now put the pin back
in there and let's

01:04.368 --> 01:07.023
get out of...
What are you doing?Oh, no.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.329
I think I lost the pin.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.634
You what?

01:12.028 --> 01:13.682
Yup, it's gone.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.684
I think it fell
into that drain.

01:15.727 --> 01:19.035
But you can
do something, right?Uh...

01:19.079 --> 01:20.645
What do you mean, "Uh"?

01:26.956 --> 01:28.827
What?

01:28.871 --> 01:31.134
MacGYVER:
Ew. Don't touch it. I know.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.223
But wood is a very
versatile material.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.138
It's got a high
tensile strength,

01:35.182 --> 01:36.574
meaning it's difficult
to pull apart,

01:36.618 --> 01:38.185
and it's got
a high compressive strength,

01:38.228 --> 01:40.317
so it won't break
when you put pressure on it.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.406
That actually gonna work?

01:42.450 --> 01:43.886
MacGYVER:
Probably not, because wood

01:43.929 --> 01:46.323
doesn't have a high shear strength, which is

01:46.367 --> 01:48.325
a material's ability
to resist two forces

01:48.369 --> 01:50.240
pushing in opposite directions,

01:50.284 --> 01:53.417
like scissors, or say,
a grenade trigger switch.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.854
How fast can you
get to the door?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.160
Do I have any other options?

01:57.204 --> 01:58.727
Hold your hand
on that all day.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.250
But my hand's
already cramping.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.774
And you already know my family
got a history of arthritis.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.212
Then this is our only option.

02:07.388 --> 02:08.954
This should buy us
some extra seconds.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.913
Now, roll it to
the end of the room,

02:10.956 --> 02:12.697
and then we run. Fast.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.090
Okay. On three.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.658
One, two,

02:16.701 --> 02:18.138
three!

02:54.261 --> 02:57.699
Mac? Mac? You here?

02:58.743 --> 03:00.223
Phew.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.660
Man, what the hell?

03:02.704 --> 03:05.010
I was cooking us dinner.Is that supposed to be food?

03:08.405 --> 03:10.102
I'll never understand
how someone

03:10.146 --> 03:12.366
who can disarm a bomb
with a paperclip

03:12.409 --> 03:14.237
can't cook a simple meal.

03:14.281 --> 03:17.197
Yeah, well, we all have
our strengths and weaknesses.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.372
Isn't that right?

03:18.415 --> 03:20.243
Yeah, yeah.

03:20.287 --> 03:23.028
So why'd you
go all Top Cheftoday?

03:23.072 --> 03:25.553
I know the last week hasn't been
easy for you, with Leanna

03:25.596 --> 03:28.295
having second thoughts
about moving in with you, so I

03:28.338 --> 03:30.514
thought a home-cooked meal
would take your mind off it.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.170
Thanks, Mac, but I'm fine.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.303
I can honestly say,
after a little reflection,

03:36.346 --> 03:38.218
this one was for the best.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.002
She'll come around.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.136
Matty needs us in the war room.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.051
Well, let's pack some
of this up to go, then.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.532
Uh, how about we don't?
Just leave that there.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.534
You know... leave it.You sure?

03:50.578 --> 03:52.144
Yeah. Oh, I'm sure.Okay.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.321
Yeah. I mean, I bet
underneath the burnt,

03:54.364 --> 03:56.714
there's some pretty good stuff.I bet you're wrong.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.945
What's that
burning smell?

04:09.988 --> 04:11.947
Dinner.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.949
You know, sometimes I think

04:13.992 --> 04:17.169
I need to keep you two
under 24-hour surveillance.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.302
It's a little creepy knowing
that's actually an option.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.436
Just takes
one phone call.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.439
So, what do we got today?

04:25.482 --> 04:27.441
This is surveillance footage

04:27.484 --> 04:29.399
from the Westwood Vault Company,

04:29.443 --> 04:33.316
inside one of their most private
and secure vaults in California.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.162
This footage
is two hours old.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.120
The four in the cat
masks are a notorious

04:55.164 --> 04:56.557
group of thieves
responsible

04:56.600 --> 04:59.908
for over a dozen high-end
robberies in the last year.

04:59.951 --> 05:03.128
Today they were trying to steal
five million in gold bullion.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.652
That woman in
the cat mask--

05:04.695 --> 05:07.916
she's their leader,
Charlotte Cole.

05:07.959 --> 05:11.528
Turns out Charlotte has been
living quite the double life.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.660
By day,
she's a married

05:12.703 --> 05:15.271
mother of two
who works as a sales rep

05:15.315 --> 05:18.405
for an L.A. medical
company. But by night

05:18.448 --> 05:20.407
she moonlights
as a master thief.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.973
Well, it's a solid cover.
Who would suspect

05:22.017 --> 05:24.149
a young mom of leading
a gang of thieves?

05:24.193 --> 05:27.152
And a job in sales means no one
would wonder about her travel.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.111
If Charlotte and her gang
are already in custody,

05:29.154 --> 05:30.634
what do you need from us?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.767
I need you to become them.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.029
24 hours ago

05:34.072 --> 05:36.336
a criminal known
only as The Fence

05:36.379 --> 05:37.337
contacted
Charlotte

05:37.380 --> 05:38.903
to hire her crew for a job.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.471
The Fence is a very
high-value target.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.691
He has the honor
of landing on almost

05:43.734 --> 05:46.302
every intelligence service's
wish list.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.564
Is it weird
I've never heard of him?

05:47.608 --> 05:49.218
You know, I was just
thinking the same thing,

05:49.261 --> 05:50.567
but I didn't
want to say anything.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.829
Actually, no.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.265
The Fence has made it a priority

05:53.309 --> 05:55.355
to remain completely
anonymous. We have

05:55.398 --> 05:58.445
no photos of him,
no voice recordings, nothing.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.447
All we know is
that he hires

06:00.490 --> 06:04.146
high-line thieves for one-off
jobs to steal valuable items,

06:04.189 --> 06:06.235
then he funnels the profits
to over a dozen

06:06.278 --> 06:07.671
terrorist groups.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.804
You want us to go to Charlotte's
meeting with The Fence.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.023
That's correct.
I want you three to pose

06:12.067 --> 06:13.677
as the thieves, with Riley

06:13.721 --> 06:16.463
as your leader, the
new Charlotte Cole.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.029
BOZER:
Wait. Doesn't The Fence

06:18.073 --> 06:19.770
know what
the cat mask gang looks like?

06:19.814 --> 06:22.164
No one knows what they
look like, no one except for us.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.036
So we go to this meeting
and take The Fence into custody.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.908
No.
You go to this meeting

06:26.951 --> 06:29.171
and you accept whatever job
the Fence offers you.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.042
Then you will
pull off the job,

06:31.086 --> 06:33.567
deliver the stolen goods,
and the minute he takes

06:33.610 --> 06:35.264
physical possession,
we slap on the cuffs.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.613
You want leverage

06:36.657 --> 06:37.962
to squeeze the Fence
for everything he knows

06:38.006 --> 06:39.094
about the terror groups
he's funding.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.965
That is correct.
We take down The Fence

06:41.009 --> 06:42.924
and who knows
how many enemies of the state

06:42.967 --> 06:44.186
he takes down with him?

06:44.229 --> 06:45.840
BOZER:
Do we know what
he wants them...

06:45.883 --> 06:47.407
I mean us, to steal?

06:47.450 --> 06:49.060
We don't.
Could be anything.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.367
Precious metals,
electronics, exotic cars.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.847
We just don't know yet.

06:52.890 --> 06:53.978
So where are we meeting him?

06:54.022 --> 06:55.066
Well, that's the first thing

06:55.110 --> 06:56.416
we need to find out.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.596
Charlotte Cole,
we're here with an offer.

07:02.639 --> 07:05.468
Give us the location of
your meeting with The Fence,

07:05.512 --> 07:06.774
and in return, we will only

07:06.817 --> 07:08.166
hold you and your crew

07:08.210 --> 07:09.603
for 48 hours

07:09.646 --> 07:11.343
before wiping
your records clean

07:11.387 --> 07:13.476
and releasing you
back into the wild

07:13.520 --> 07:15.260
as the fine,
upstanding citizens

07:15.304 --> 07:17.437
who will never break
another law again.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.527
Ever.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.443
We'll consider this
a life-changing mini vacation.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.750
That's the carrot.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.709
What's the stick?

07:28.752 --> 07:30.014
MATTY:
Refuse to give me

07:30.058 --> 07:31.538
the location of your meeting,

07:31.581 --> 07:34.105
and you will disappear
down a dark hole

07:34.149 --> 07:36.760
where there are no clocks
and no calendars to track

07:36.804 --> 07:39.546
the years you will be spending
down there.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.202
It's your choice.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.119
Five seconds. Go.

07:54.038 --> 07:57.041
Considering
you're holding all the cards,

07:57.085 --> 07:58.782
and I'm not a fan

07:58.826 --> 08:02.525
of dark holes, how about
I make this easy for you?

08:02.569 --> 08:03.874
Smart lady.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.204
There were supposed
to be four of you.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.032
He wasn't pulling his weight.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.642
We parted ways.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.255
I trust he isn't

08:37.299 --> 08:39.257
a man who talks.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.389
Not anymore.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.261
Charlotte Cole.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.220
Your reputation
precedes you.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.351
As does yours.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.092
Well, then how
I conduct my business

08:48.136 --> 08:49.877
is not going to be a surprise.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.574
My terms are non-negotiable.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.577
We work together one time.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.362
I give you the details of
the job, you pull it off.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.712
Once I acquire
the goods

08:58.755 --> 09:00.714
you're paid, we part ways,

09:00.757 --> 09:03.020
and we never speak again.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.370
Unless you give me a reason

09:05.414 --> 09:07.111
to continue the conversation.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.417
Clear?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.462
Fine by me.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.335
So, what are these goods?

09:13.378 --> 09:15.250
There is a briefcase
being smuggled

09:15.293 --> 09:16.686
into the Russian tech giant

09:16.730 --> 09:19.123
Silver Wall Technologies,
Moscow office,

09:19.167 --> 09:20.995
for an off-the-books sale.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.387
I want you to
acquire the briefcase

09:22.431 --> 09:23.780
before it changes hands.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.261
I recruited you because

09:26.304 --> 09:28.959
you've broken into Silver Wall
once before, yes?

09:29.003 --> 09:31.266
I've been inside.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.528
Anything you can
tell us about it?

09:32.572 --> 09:36.314
Plenty. But I don't
share trade secrets.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.577
Fair enough.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.753
The sale goes down
tomorrow at 4:00

09:39.796 --> 09:42.320
in a secure sub-basement lab

09:42.364 --> 09:44.322
in the R&D wing.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.543
4:00 pm, tomorrow, in Moscow?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.285
Is the timing
gonna be a problem?

09:50.328 --> 09:52.330
Depends on the job specs.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.418
I just gave 'em to you.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.203
You seem to be missing

09:55.246 --> 09:57.814
a few key details.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.512
Your group's good.

10:00.556 --> 10:01.644
Hmm.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.254
Fill in the gaps.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.561
I got a gap.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.693
What's in the briefcase?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.307
A dirty bomb.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.352
A nuke?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.920
Boom.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.357
We steal diamonds,

10:19.401 --> 10:21.664
gold jewelry, bearer bonds.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.797
We've never stolen
something like this.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.410
"Never have" is different
than "never will".

10:28.453 --> 10:30.847
What category are you in?

10:30.891 --> 10:33.545
We haven't talked price.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.373
One million dollars

10:35.417 --> 10:37.027
to expand your horizons

10:37.071 --> 10:38.550
and steal the briefcase.

10:38.594 --> 10:41.162
So...

10:41.205 --> 10:42.598
what do you say?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.515
High-risk item,

10:46.558 --> 10:49.257
ultra-secure building
in a foreign country

10:49.300 --> 10:51.215
on a nearly impossible timeline.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.784
Two million.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.612
Not a penny less.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.614
Done.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.226
Congrats.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.099
You just bought yourself
a weapon of mass destruction.Mm.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.107
Okay, Matty, we need
to call an audible

11:13.150 --> 11:15.109
and shut this thing down now.
The Fence just hired us to steal

11:15.152 --> 11:17.851
a dirty bomb out of a Russian
tech giant in Moscow.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.983
That's a negative
on the audible, Mac.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.203
Getting authorization
to deploy boots on the ground

11:22.246 --> 11:23.813
in Russia could take days.

11:23.857 --> 11:26.163
By then the dirty bomb
will be in the wind.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.731
No. We have to stick
to the original plan.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.734
Hey, Matty, I'm on the
Silver Wall company website now.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.563
Looks like they're throwing
a gala in their building

11:34.606 --> 11:36.565
to celebrate
some new product launch.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.740
And guess what time it starts.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.394
4:00 p.m. tomorrow.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.613
You know, a gala sounds like
great cover for a sale.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.746
Buyer and seller could use
an invite to this shindig

11:43.790 --> 11:45.748
as their way into
the well-guarded building.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.751
Get me an up-to-the-minute
guest list for that gala.

11:49.796 --> 11:50.927
Uh, look at this.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.494
Silver Wall created

11:52.537 --> 11:54.365
a defense division last year.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.977
It might be possible that one of
their employees is the seller.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.414
It might explain why they have
a dirty bomb and why the sale

11:59.457 --> 12:01.546
is going down in one of
their ultra-secure labs.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.765
What kind of damage
are we talking

12:02.809 --> 12:04.245
if this nuclear weapon goes off?

12:04.288 --> 12:05.986
Well, technically, a dirty bomb
isn't a nuclear weapon.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.770
It's radiological
material strapped to

12:07.814 --> 12:10.164
a conventional explosive.
So, bomb goes off,

12:10.207 --> 12:12.470
if it spreads
radioactive dust.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.994
Depending on the
element deployed,

12:14.037 --> 12:15.778
it can affect thousands.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.388
A dirty bomb is hard to track

12:17.432 --> 12:20.130
and easy to hide. We cannot let
this slip through our fingers.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.567
Uh, guys, we might
have a problem.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.831
I can't find schematics
for Silver Wall online

12:24.874 --> 12:27.181
and I can't get past
their network's firewall.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.878
So now I have no idea
what the building looks like

12:28.922 --> 12:30.271
or what kind
of security they have.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.751
So this heist
is gonna be completely

12:31.794 --> 12:32.926
by the seat of our pants?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.623
Well, if we can't
get eyes inside,

12:34.666 --> 12:36.103
I guess it's gonna have to be.

12:36.146 --> 12:39.019
What if I get us eyes
that have already been inside?

12:51.205 --> 12:52.815
MATTY:
Beautiful home and family.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.208
Congrats.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.254
I told you where my meeting
with the Fence was.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.560
We had a deal.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.996
Why are we here?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.911
Did the Fence tell you
what he wanted you to steal?

13:01.955 --> 13:04.871
I never ask a client
what I'm hired to steal

13:04.914 --> 13:06.742
and they don't tell me.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.091
Cleaner that way.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.572
Do you know the building
you were supposed to hit?

13:10.615 --> 13:12.095
Was gonna find that out
at that meeting

13:12.139 --> 13:13.618
I could never make it to.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.751
Silver Wall Tech
in Moscow.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.187
The Fence said you had
been in there before

13:17.231 --> 13:19.537
and that's why
he hired you.

13:19.581 --> 13:21.148
Yeah. My crew
pulled off a job

13:21.191 --> 13:22.889
inside Silver Wall
six months ago.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.891
So why are we here?

13:24.934 --> 13:27.589
We're here because
I'm extending you a new offer.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.548
Help us to break into
Silver Wall, steal an object,

13:30.592 --> 13:32.594
and get out undetected
and you go free.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.597
But refuse, and I will
march you straight up

13:35.640 --> 13:38.861
to that front door and tell your
two adorable children

13:38.905 --> 13:41.777
exactly who their mother
really is: a dangerous thief

13:41.821 --> 13:44.214
who will miss both their high
school and college graduations.

13:47.391 --> 13:50.655
You really don't
mess around, do you?

13:52.570 --> 13:55.138
Okay. You got a deal.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.923
So, now what?

13:56.966 --> 14:00.013
We get started.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.109
Who exactly are you guys?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.895
Let me take you through
what we have so far.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.767
As you can see,
the schematic is incomplete.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.944
We only have the most basic
description of the interior

14:17.987 --> 14:21.164
based on a handful of marketing
photos we found online.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.950
The sale is happening
at a gala tomorrow.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.082
So you going in as bartenders
or cleaning crew?

14:26.126 --> 14:27.867
Cleaning crew.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.520
Forged ID badges

14:29.564 --> 14:31.827
linked to dummy
employee accounts

14:31.871 --> 14:33.481
will get us through
lobby security.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.700
Bozer will be waiting
in the getaway vehicle

14:35.744 --> 14:37.441
while the rest of us
head inside.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.182
RILEY: Once we pass through the lobby,

14:39.226 --> 14:42.272
we're gonna head down what we
believe is the main corridor.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.708
According to The Fence,
the sale's

14:43.752 --> 14:44.884
happening in a sub-basement.

14:47.495 --> 14:48.844
Hold on.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.933
Getting down
into the sub-basement

14:50.977 --> 14:53.327
means bypassing
multiple layers of security.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.981
How are the buyer and
seller gonna do that?

14:55.024 --> 14:56.417
We have reason to
believe the seller

14:56.460 --> 14:57.940
is an employee
of the company.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.551
And you guys are what,
some private group

15:00.595 --> 15:02.597
or government,
maybe?

15:02.640 --> 15:05.208
CIA? DIA? NSA?

15:05.252 --> 15:08.168
I suggest you spend less time
guessing who we are

15:08.211 --> 15:10.039
and more time planning
how you're gonna help.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.172
Marker, please.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.263
Your idea to go through
the lobby is good.

15:16.306 --> 15:19.092
But at the end of this hallway
there's a security door,

15:19.135 --> 15:20.745
kind of like a bank vault,

15:20.789 --> 15:22.878
and your cleaning crew badges
aren't gonna swipe you through.

15:22.922 --> 15:23.923
So what's your plan?

15:25.185 --> 15:26.838
I can make a powerful
electromagnet

15:26.882 --> 15:29.537
to slide the metal bolts,
force the door open.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.547
Once we pass through the door,
we're gonna head...

15:41.853 --> 15:44.117
Sorry.
They got you.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.988
What do you mean,
"they got you"?

15:46.032 --> 15:47.685
This door

15:47.729 --> 15:51.167
you just snuck through leads to a security checkpoint,

15:51.211 --> 15:52.603
so what I mean is...

15:52.647 --> 15:53.778
they got you.

15:53.822 --> 15:54.779
But we

15:54.823 --> 15:56.607
won't be going
through that door.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.740
See, the cool thing
about this building is

15:58.783 --> 16:00.698
it's full of secret hallways
and rooms.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.570
So instead of going down
this main hall,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.180
we're gonna take this side hall

16:04.224 --> 16:05.660
which leads to
a service elevator,

16:05.703 --> 16:08.141
and that...Wait, w-wait--
the service elevator

16:08.184 --> 16:10.360
doesn't go down
to the sub-basement.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.710
No, it doesn't.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.886
But it does go down
to the service level,

16:14.930 --> 16:17.672
where, at the end of this hall,
you're gonna find another door

16:17.715 --> 16:19.195
marked
"maintenance closet."

16:19.239 --> 16:20.631
Inside here you're
gonna find more

16:20.675 --> 16:22.546
than just cleaning products.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.983
There's another security door

16:24.026 --> 16:25.636
with a card reader

16:25.680 --> 16:26.855
that leads to
a restricted hallway

16:26.898 --> 16:29.640
that only the top brass
has access to.

17:05.807 --> 17:06.808
Clear frame.

17:16.470 --> 17:17.558
We're good.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.013
Here.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.928
Thanks.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.109
CHARLOTTE: At the end of this
hall there's a staircase

17:47.153 --> 17:49.851
which leads you
to the sub-basement.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.201
If the meeting's
happening in an R&D lab,

17:52.245 --> 17:53.855
it's gonna be
a little more tricky.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.639
Why would that be
a little more tricky?

17:55.683 --> 17:57.815
There's a pressure plate
security system

17:57.859 --> 18:00.557
protecting the hall
that leads to the R&D labs.

18:00.601 --> 18:03.256
The slightest shift
in weight sets it off,

18:03.299 --> 18:04.953
sending Silver Wall
security running.

18:04.996 --> 18:07.869
The only way to disable it
is with a retinal scan.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.132
And the computer that's
controlling it is air gapped,

18:10.176 --> 18:11.742
so no hacking it remotely.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.658
Well, getting past the pressure
plate can't be impossible.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.443
You did it.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.445
So what'd you do--
steal someone's eyeball?

18:18.488 --> 18:20.534
Not quite.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.891
RILEY: And how long
did that take you?

18:29.934 --> 18:31.240
Seven minutes.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.589
If three of us go in, that's

18:32.633 --> 18:33.895
21 minutes, at best.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.723
I don't think
we have that much time.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.551
We won't, but it does
give me an idea.

18:43.905 --> 18:45.559
MacGYVER: Using parts
from the cleaning cart,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.387
I'm going to build us a sled
that will suspend us

18:47.430 --> 18:48.736
over the pressure plate...

18:55.960 --> 18:58.049
...by transferring
the weight of our bodies

18:58.093 --> 18:59.486
into the force
keeping the wheels and cart

18:59.529 --> 19:01.531
tight against the wall.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.668
You can really build that?

19:09.235 --> 19:10.497
Let's go get that briefcase.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.195
You guys are fun.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.501
Don't worry,
I got it.

19:23.466 --> 19:27.035
BOZER:
196, 197,

19:27.078 --> 19:30.604
198, 199...

19:30.647 --> 19:34.564
and the guy with the silly hat
is the 200th guest to enter.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.175
All right, we're in.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.176
You getting this, Matty?

19:40.831 --> 19:42.006
Yeah, I got it.

19:45.619 --> 19:48.143
BOZER:
What is that thing?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.536
It's an IMSI catcher.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.451
It poses as a cell tower
and forces all phones

19:51.494 --> 19:52.843
in the area to connect.

19:52.887 --> 19:54.889
It allows us to tap into
all the local cell traffic.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.282
Hopefully, we can

19:56.325 --> 19:57.848
use this to sift
through all the texts

19:57.892 --> 20:00.721
and ID the buyer and the seller
by using a keyword program.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.418
Then, once we have their
numbers, we can track them

20:02.462 --> 20:04.681
visually and send Phoenix
agents to pick 'em up later.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.293
You guys have just
under an hour until the sale.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.033
Should take about 30 minutes

20:09.077 --> 20:10.905
from the front entrance
to the lab,

20:10.948 --> 20:12.602
so plenty of time
to get in position.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.430
Let's get ready.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.487
I've got a question I've been
dying to ask since L.A.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.489
Why are you still living
the secret cat burglar life

20:29.532 --> 20:31.055
when you have a family at home?

20:31.099 --> 20:32.796
People tell new mothers that

20:32.840 --> 20:34.972
they shouldn't
give up their hobbies.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.018
That continuing them only
makes you a better mother

20:37.061 --> 20:38.454
and wife.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.369
Being a thief has
always been my hobby.

20:41.501 --> 20:45.374
But it never...
scratched that itch I had

20:45.418 --> 20:47.550
for something a bit
more challenging.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.291
Doing this does.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.685
You ever consider
ignoring the itch and...

20:51.728 --> 20:53.034
going straight?

20:53.077 --> 20:55.689
Right after I got married,
I tried.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.865
But I missed it.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.997
Besides, I'm really good at it.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.738
Maybe you should consider
a hobby that doesn't put you

21:01.782 --> 21:03.871
behind bars for more
than a decade.

21:03.914 --> 21:06.569
The keyword logger
just got a hit.

21:06.613 --> 21:07.918
I think we have a problem.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.311
This text was just sent

21:09.355 --> 21:11.008
and it came
from inside Silver Wall.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.619
"Ten minutes to clear.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.012
Minimum safe distance
two miles."

21:15.056 --> 21:17.624
Minimum safe distance--
what does that mean?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.060
The Fence's intel was wrong.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.888
This isn't a sale.
It's an attack.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.368
You mean someone
just triggered the dirty bomb?

21:22.411 --> 21:25.327
The Fence hired me
to steal a dirty bomb?

21:25.371 --> 21:26.720
Yeah. And it's gonna
go off in ten minutes,

21:26.763 --> 21:27.982
so let's get inside now.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.113
But getting down to
the lab is gonna take

21:29.157 --> 21:30.114
30 minutes.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.246
What are we gonna do?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.075
Improvise.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.521
All right, Matty, we're in.

21:45.565 --> 21:46.957
Charlotte and I
are headed to the lab,

21:47.001 --> 21:48.394
Riley and Bozer to security.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.656
We're down to nine minutes,

21:49.699 --> 21:50.657
so whatever you're planning...

21:50.700 --> 21:51.832
Do it fast.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.442
Got it.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.045
Nice job, Bozer.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.133
Hey.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.831
Double-O Bo.Jack would be proud.

22:40.837 --> 22:41.882
I'm okay.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.667
Okay, Matty,
security's ours.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.498
Found them.
They're in the elevator.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.718
Mac, hallways on
the service floor

22:51.761 --> 22:53.067
are clear to the
maintenance closet.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.285
Great.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.722
How we doing
on the vault door behind it?

22:55.765 --> 22:56.940
Still working on that, Mac.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.986
There's a reason
why this wasn't the plan.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.209
Seven minutes, Mac.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.431
You know, you don't
have to come with me.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.999
Would I have time to reach
minimum safe distance

23:12.042 --> 23:14.001
if I took off now?Maybe, but it's not just

23:14.044 --> 23:15.481
the initial explosion
you have to worry about.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.657
When a dirty bomb explodes
and the particles scatter,

23:17.700 --> 23:20.094
wind becomes the big concern,
because it can blow

23:20.137 --> 23:21.922
the radiological material
in any direction.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.445
Well, sounds like I don't
have much of a choice.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.447
Mac, you got two guards
headed your way.

23:30.539 --> 23:34.021
What are you doing?I'm trying to make something
to knock 'em out with.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.115
Well, that happened.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.638
My husband and I take Krav Maga
at this great place

23:42.682 --> 23:43.857
in the Valley, if you
ever want to join.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.380
Riley?

23:50.559 --> 23:52.169
Got it.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.481
Riley, any chance

23:59.525 --> 24:01.222
you can turn off this
pressure plate for me?

24:01.265 --> 24:02.789
No. I tried.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.007
What are we gonna do?

24:04.051 --> 24:07.707
We don't have time
to build your sled thing.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.414
Mac, you better hurry.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.459
Pretty sure security
just realized

24:20.502 --> 24:21.590
something's going on.

24:21.634 --> 24:22.983
You got a half a dozen
coming your way.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.724
MacGYVER:
Matty, we're in the lab.

24:28.075 --> 24:29.337
Got eyes on the briefcase.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.469
It looks like someone
took out a security guard

24:30.512 --> 24:31.774
before we got here.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.515
Be careful, Mac.
Whoever knocked out that guard

24:33.559 --> 24:35.517
and set the bomb
could still be down there.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.476
Copy that.

24:46.223 --> 24:48.312
MATTY:
Mac?

24:48.356 --> 24:49.139
Talk to me.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.576
Okay, we've got

24:50.619 --> 24:52.578
a brick of plastic explosive
strapped to a detonator.

24:52.621 --> 24:54.536
Nothing too fancy.
What worries me

24:54.580 --> 24:55.885
is that
the radiological compound

24:55.929 --> 24:57.539
is Americium-241.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.062
And that's bad?

24:59.106 --> 25:00.890
It's not something
you want inside your body.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.413
If this goes off,
it could kill thousands.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.850
Let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.112
Sounds like a plan.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.156
Less than a minute.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.332
Okay, I need your help.

25:08.376 --> 25:09.899
You see that?
That's a mercury switch.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.858
It will complete the circuit
and detonate the explosive

25:11.901 --> 25:13.294
if we lift the briefcase.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.817
Okay, what do you need me to do?

25:14.861 --> 25:16.036
You have steady hands, right?

25:16.079 --> 25:18.212
Not sure how steady
they are right now.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.605
Gonna have to do.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.084
I need you to lift
the explosive,

25:21.128 --> 25:22.303
'cause the wiring
is tucked underneath,

25:22.346 --> 25:23.957
and I can't reach it.
But don't

25:24.000 --> 25:26.568
tilt it, or it will
complete the circuit and...

25:26.612 --> 25:28.962
Boom. Right.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.224
Got it.

25:54.944 --> 25:55.945
Are we alive?

25:55.989 --> 25:56.990
Yeah.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.516
Bomb's disarmed.
You can put it down.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.171
MATTY: Security is heading
your way. You guys pack it up

26:04.214 --> 26:06.086
and get out of there.Okay, Matty, we're heading out.

26:10.264 --> 26:13.267
I could not have done that
without you.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.965
What the hell are you doing?

26:16.009 --> 26:19.055
What I do best.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.057
Matty, Charlotte has the bomb
and is getting away.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.506
Tac team one,
at the warehouse, go.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.250
Move, move.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.954
Clear!

26:47.997 --> 26:49.085
Clear.

26:49.129 --> 26:51.131
Go. Go.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.003
All clear.

26:55.048 --> 26:59.008
Tac team two, at the house, go.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.270
Clear!Clear!

27:01.837 --> 27:03.926
Clear!Clear!

27:03.970 --> 27:05.319
Clear.

27:09.018 --> 27:10.629
Hey, no one's here.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.065
There was no way to keep a lid

27:12.108 --> 27:13.414
on what went down
at Silver Wall.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.503
The Fence must know
something went wrong.

27:15.546 --> 27:18.027
Find me Charlotte's family,
and find me the plane

27:18.071 --> 27:20.203
she took from Russia
back to the U.S.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.945
Convincing Russian authorities
to release my agents

27:22.989 --> 27:25.034
gave Charlotte a head start,
and we have got

27:25.078 --> 27:26.514
to make up that time.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.052
All right, Matty, we're here.
We sure this is her plane?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.751
MATTY: The pilot positively
ID'd her from her photo,

27:45.794 --> 27:47.622
but he had no idea
where she was going.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.407
Oh, and there's more.
Charlotte's family is gone.

27:50.451 --> 27:52.540
Got to assume
she got them into hiding.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.107
Okay, well, if Charlotte
called her house,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.152
then maybe we can trace that
call to a cell phone, find her

27:56.196 --> 27:57.371
current location.
Riley?

27:57.414 --> 27:59.112
No. We can't.

27:59.155 --> 28:00.940
These phone records
are showing a dozen calls

28:00.983 --> 28:02.898
from a burner phone to
Charlotte's husband's cell,

28:02.942 --> 28:04.770
but he never answered.
I'm guessing it was Charlotte.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.293
But now we can't track it.
Burner's been shut off.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.424
It's a dead end.

28:07.468 --> 28:08.643
So The Fence and Charlotte
are gone,

28:08.687 --> 28:10.123
and now there's
a dirty bomb loose

28:10.166 --> 28:11.385
somewhere on American soil.

28:11.428 --> 28:13.561
This is the nightmare scenario
we were all

28:13.604 --> 28:17.434
so desperately trying to avoid.Wait a second.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.742
Uh-oh, Matty,
Mac's got that look.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.571
That "I've got an idea
that may or may not work" look?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.138
Oh, yeah. That's the one.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.575
Look, we may not be able to
trace Charlotte's burner phone,

28:27.618 --> 28:29.446
but we might be able
to track the dirty bomb itself.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.839
You can do that?

28:30.883 --> 28:32.667
Yeah.
Or, at least, I think so.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.277
The shielding on the briefcase
was terrible.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.670
It was leaking radiation.
Not enough

28:35.714 --> 28:36.932
to kill you or anything,
but it should be enough

28:36.976 --> 28:39.239
to put us on the trail.
I need your cell phones.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.154
I hate to sound like Jack,
but I just upgraded.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.546
Okay?
I'd like to get this back.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.288
Phones ain't cheap, Mac.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.681
You didn't get the insurance?

28:46.725 --> 28:47.682
I never get the insurance.

28:47.726 --> 28:48.857
Do you?

28:48.901 --> 28:50.467
Well, yeah, ever since
I met him, I do.

29:20.106 --> 29:21.934
What you doing, Mac?

29:21.977 --> 29:24.501
Okay, so, fun fact
about cell phone cameras:

29:24.545 --> 29:25.851
they can see way more
of the electromagnetic spectrum

29:25.894 --> 29:27.548
than we can,

29:27.591 --> 29:28.505
including gamma rays,
which is what

29:28.549 --> 29:29.724
the dirty bomb is giving off.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.334
Hold up, what are you saying--

29:31.378 --> 29:33.380
there's a app that lets you
track dirty bombs?

29:33.423 --> 29:35.599
Actually, kind of.
The DoD developed

29:35.643 --> 29:38.820
a software for radiation
detection devices that are

29:38.864 --> 29:40.822
basically handheld computers
attached to cameras,

29:40.866 --> 29:42.476
which are exactly
what cell phones are.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.043
So all we have to do
is download that software

29:44.086 --> 29:46.175
and I should be able to make
a portable radiation detector.

29:46.219 --> 29:47.350
MATTY:
That's a great idea, Mac,

29:47.394 --> 29:49.352
but getting authorization
from the DoD

29:49.396 --> 29:51.441
to use their software
could take hours.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.488
Hours that we just don't have.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.229
So, Riley?

29:56.272 --> 29:58.666
Music to my ears, Matty.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.321
One boss-approved hack
of the DoD coming up.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.338
Okay, Matty, I'm in.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.035
I'm downloading
the software now.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.390
Yeah, we picked up her trail.
Let's go.

30:36.747 --> 30:39.402
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.883
Okay, Mac, NEST is on alert

30:41.927 --> 30:43.493
and choppers
are in the air sweeping

30:43.537 --> 30:46.540
for anomalies
in the radiation background map.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.411
They made a radiation
background map of L.A.?

30:48.455 --> 30:50.152
Yeah.
Every major city

30:50.196 --> 30:52.285
in the U.S. has been mapped
by helicopter

30:52.328 --> 30:54.896
to measure
background radiation levels.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.550
So if a nuclear device
enters a city,

30:56.593 --> 30:59.466
it has a chance of being found,
because it appears as an anomaly

30:59.509 --> 31:01.381
against the recorded background.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.557
Now, this map
acts as a baseline

31:03.600 --> 31:05.385
for my little device here,
so we can pick up

31:05.428 --> 31:06.690
on low levels
of leaking gamma rays

31:06.734 --> 31:07.909
coming from Charlotte's
briefcase.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.171
That way we can track her.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.304
Looks like gamma ray levels
are increasing.

31:11.347 --> 31:13.567
Take a left up here, Boze.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.397
Mac, NEST is confirming

31:17.440 --> 31:20.748
a gamma ray anomaly just ahead
of your current location.

31:20.791 --> 31:21.923
You found it.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.534
MacGYVER:
Up here, pull over.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.893
She's got to be close.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.385
BOZER:
We got eyes on Charlotte

31:49.429 --> 31:50.865
but not the bomb.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.041
Gamma readings just dipped.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.303
Not sure why.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.957
Maybe a combination
of shielding and distance

31:56.001 --> 31:57.741
is dampening
the signal.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.310
RILEY: She looks nervous.
Not that I blame her.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.617
I wouldn't want to be anywhere
near that dirty bomb.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.543
All right, Matty,
we got visual on The Fence.

32:16.586 --> 32:19.328
BOZER: What's happening?
Not a whole lot

32:19.372 --> 32:21.113
of exchanging going on
at this exchange.

32:21.156 --> 32:24.464
Riley pretended to be Charlotte,
so The Fence is expecting Riley.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.639
Who are you?

32:32.341 --> 32:34.082
MacGYVER: Hey, Matty,
we just got another group

32:34.126 --> 32:36.389
show up to the party.
I'm sending you a picture now.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.265
That's Darren Farragut.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.832
He's a domestic terrorist,

32:44.875 --> 32:48.357
currently number eight
on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.969
Last year he published
a manifesto detailing

32:51.012 --> 32:53.145
how he plans to overthrow
the U.S. government.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.191
The Fence wasn't just buying
that bomb from Charlotte.

32:56.235 --> 32:58.628
He's flipping it
straight to the end user.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.282
If Farragut gets his hands

33:00.326 --> 33:01.936
on that bomb,
there is no telling

33:01.980 --> 33:03.503
where in the U.S. he'll use it.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.940
We need a plan. Fast.Be right back.

33:13.382 --> 33:14.775
I got an idea.

33:14.818 --> 33:17.082
One that involves our emergency
roadside repair kit?

33:18.344 --> 33:19.780
Where's my merchandise?

33:19.823 --> 33:21.564
Answer my question first.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.176
My name is
Charlotte Cole.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.308
You hired me to bring you this.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.707
Now follow through
on your end of the deal.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.317
RILEY:
She's lying.

33:37.754 --> 33:40.105
I'm Charlotte Cole.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.368
I've got the briefcase
you hired me to steal.

33:42.411 --> 33:45.066
And I have no idea
who that woman is.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.382
Matty, we have
visual confirmation

33:56.425 --> 33:57.644
that Charlotte
has the dirty bomb.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.080
BOZER:
And to buy us some time,

33:59.124 --> 34:00.734
Riley just walked
off to bluff

34:00.777 --> 34:02.518
The Fence and Darren Farragut.

34:02.562 --> 34:04.520
Guys, we cannot lose
that briefcase.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.827
If The Fence or Farragut
disappear with it,

34:06.870 --> 34:09.003
there's no telling what city
it could blow up in.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.527
And we also need to make sure
it doesn't blow up right here.

34:11.571 --> 34:14.791
Agreed. That's why we need
to hold off on the tac teams.

34:14.835 --> 34:17.359
Adding more guns to this
situation could end very badly.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.882
Does this mean you have a plan?

34:20.884 --> 34:23.278
I have half of one.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.454
I'm gonna recover the bomb
in that suitcase using

34:25.498 --> 34:26.890
a much, much smaller one,

34:26.934 --> 34:29.676
except the only thing
dirty about mine

34:29.719 --> 34:32.418
is the trash it's made from:
aluminum foil,

34:32.461 --> 34:35.247
corroded battery acid,
a plastic bottle,

34:35.290 --> 34:36.509
and an old tire.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.250
RILEY: I don't know
what game you're playing,

34:38.293 --> 34:40.469
but my people broke into Silver
Wall and stole the dirty bomb.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.297
I've got it right here.

34:42.341 --> 34:44.169
Whoever this woman is,
she's not Charlotte Cole.

34:44.212 --> 34:45.474
Whoever this woman is,

34:45.518 --> 34:48.477
she has no idea what
she's talking about,

34:48.521 --> 34:51.089
and I think she'd be wise
to walk away right now.

34:52.568 --> 34:54.092
I'm Charlotte Cole.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.094
I have the dirty bomb.

34:57.182 --> 35:00.315
And I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.579
I don't know which one of you
is the real Charlotte Cole,

35:03.623 --> 35:05.929
but I have a way to find out.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.473
Mom!

35:28.387 --> 35:30.519
Charlotte, what's going on?

35:30.563 --> 35:31.955
I think we just
ran out of time, boys.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.044
She's the real Charlotte Cole.
Kill her.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.155
Get the case!

36:06.512 --> 36:09.428
Give me the case,
or your family dies!

36:14.737 --> 36:16.086
I'm friends with Charlotte,
come on!

36:16.130 --> 36:17.392
Go, go, hurry!Come on, let's go!

36:19.089 --> 36:20.613
Go, go, go, go!

36:20.656 --> 36:22.049
Let's get out
of here now.

36:27.968 --> 36:29.230
OFFICER:
Freeze! Drop the gun!

36:40.198 --> 36:42.069
Guys, get back.
The case is leaking.

36:42.112 --> 36:43.636
Matty, the case was hit.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.116
NEST team, go now.
Mac, is there anything

36:46.160 --> 36:48.249
you can do to contain that leak?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.295
Yeah, I can, uh, I can
use cement or-or the

36:50.338 --> 36:51.948
lead lining...
No, it's okay.

36:51.992 --> 36:54.516
What do you mean it's okay?The dirty bomb isn't here.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.649
I stashed it on my way in.

36:56.692 --> 37:00.043
I know you might think I have
a casual view of the law,

37:00.087 --> 37:02.307
but you don't really think
I'd hand radiological material

37:02.350 --> 37:04.047
over to a terrorist, do you?

37:05.832 --> 37:08.182
I only stole the bomb
from you guys

37:08.226 --> 37:10.010
'cause I didn't know
who you were.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.317
Figured I'd hand it over
to the government when I landed,

37:12.360 --> 37:13.709
anonymously.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.059
Then, when I got here,
The Fence called me and...

37:16.103 --> 37:17.539
And told you he had your family.

37:17.583 --> 37:21.456
So I set the meet,
I built the fake bomb,

37:21.500 --> 37:23.415
and came here.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.025
So, what was your plan?

37:25.068 --> 37:26.069
Improvise.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.118
Guess I was inspired by you.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.297
The real dirty bomb is
in a mailbox down the road.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.865
So, in a way, I already handed
it over to the government.

37:38.908 --> 37:40.301
Hey, guys,

37:40.345 --> 37:41.868
no cuffs.

37:41.911 --> 37:45.132
She won't be a problem.
Go say goodbye to your family.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.356
We'll get 'em home safe.

37:51.399 --> 37:54.141
I'm sure you will.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.274
You guys seem all right.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.856
Maybe she'll try and
stay out of trouble now.

38:13.900 --> 38:17.077
Maybe, but what's
the fun in that?

38:26.129 --> 38:28.349
Perfect timing
on the paella, Mac.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.003
We'll make a chef
out of you yet.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.483
At this point,
just not burning

38:31.526 --> 38:33.049
the kitchen down
is enough for me.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.356
Hey,

38:35.400 --> 38:36.705
I, uh,

38:36.749 --> 38:40.100
I didn't say this earlier,
but I appreciate you

38:40.143 --> 38:41.928
trying to make me
feel better about Leanna.

38:41.971 --> 38:45.279
Knowing you got my back
makes it easier to handle,

38:45.323 --> 38:48.282
so... thank you.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.242
You don't have to thank me
'cause you'd do the same for me.

38:52.286 --> 38:55.898
We're both here for each
other, but you know that.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.335
Yeah, I do know that.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.119
I also know

38:59.162 --> 39:01.208
you got a possible pie crust
emergency on your hands.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.645
What? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

39:03.689 --> 39:06.300
Uh-oh. You got it.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.868
Here you go.
Thank you.

39:08.911 --> 39:10.435
Looks like
a celebration.

39:10.478 --> 39:14.264
Well, it should be.
You guys took down

39:14.308 --> 39:18.530
a domestic terrorist, The Fence
and his whole organization,

39:18.573 --> 39:21.707
and because you were able to
stop that dirty bomb in Moscow,

39:21.750 --> 39:23.839
saving thousands
of lives,

39:23.883 --> 39:26.625
Russian intelligence was able
to track down the employee

39:26.668 --> 39:29.192
at Silver Wall who tried
to set off that weapon.

39:29.236 --> 39:32.413
No kidding.

39:32.457 --> 39:33.980
There's even more good news.

39:34.023 --> 39:35.155
Charlotte's back home
with her family.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.462
Seems the U.S. government
has taken

39:37.505 --> 39:40.290
a professional interest
in her unique skill set.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.770
Instead of sending her
to prison,

39:41.814 --> 39:44.294
they're putting her
on a Red Cell team

39:44.338 --> 39:46.558
to help test our nation's
secure facilities.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.995
Hmm.Okay, that makes me happy.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.518
She might've just found
her true calling.

39:50.562 --> 39:52.390
Mac, did you actually cook this?

39:53.303 --> 39:55.741
Well, I was,
I was in the kitchen

39:55.784 --> 39:58.265
while cooking was happening,
but, nah, it was mostly him.

39:59.701 --> 40:02.182
He's being modest.
Mac baked the bread and the pie.

40:02.225 --> 40:05.141
You know, baking is pretty much
just math and chemistry,

40:05.185 --> 40:06.186
so it's actually
pretty fun.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.754
Well, when you retire as a spy,

40:08.797 --> 40:10.712
I look forward to visiting you
at your bakery.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.194
I don't know,
something about a retired Mac

40:14.237 --> 40:15.369
covered in flour
doesn't sound right.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.153
Yeah, unless he's
using that flour

40:17.197 --> 40:18.546
to make rocket fuel
or something.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.245
You laugh,
but you could do it.

40:22.289 --> 40:24.639
I think, yeah, you just
put the flour in...

40:24.683 --> 40:27.250
It was a joke!
It was a joke!

40:27.294 --> 40:28.774
Right on. Copy that.

40:28.817 --> 40:31.603
ALL:
Cheers.
