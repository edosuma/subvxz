00:01.460 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously,
on</i> Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.463 --> 00:07.008
- Wow. The Patriot!
- Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:07.174 --> 00:10.302
- We're both S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
- Yes. Oh, thank God.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.680
<i>- Do you know me?
- I'm sorry.</i>

00:12.763 --> 00:14.849
<i>That's what the other agent told me
to say.</i>

00:15.016 --> 00:16.767
Hydra thanks you for your service.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.562
<i>Today, for the first time,
I couldn't look my little girl in the eye.</i>

00:19.812 --> 00:22.398
I need to make that right.
I'm here to help.

00:22.732 --> 00:26.610
This woman is not from here.
She crossed over, from the other side.

00:26.736 --> 00:29.447
Madame Hydra? She's... she's messed
with his mind.

00:29.613 --> 00:32.700
<i>Fitz would never hurt an innocent woman.</i>

00:34.326 --> 00:36.412
No!

00:36.912 --> 00:38.581
I guess you don't know me at all.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.384
I don't know.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.889
- You think this sells it?
- Honestly?

00:55.931 --> 00:58.142
- Feels a little fake.
- You're right.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.022
It looks staged. Needs a little...
something.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.492
I was thinking busted headlight.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.954
You know, I admire you
for volunteering for this, Coulson.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.874
We need all the fresh faces we can get
for undercover work.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.586
Uh. Yeah, I could do an accent
or another language, maybe.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.089
- My Spanish is <i>mucho bueno.</i>
- Just act natural.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.674
Just get them to stop the bus and open up.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.011
- Hopefully, Skye's on board.
- Well, she might be if she's been assigned

01:34.095 --> 01:36.639
to re-education at one
of Hydra's prison camps.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.432
But rescuing Skye is not the mission.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.019
- There's another prisoner I want to find.
- Does Ward know that?

01:42.228 --> 01:44.772
Yeah. He didn't take it well.

01:45.356 --> 01:48.651
His head hasn't been in the game
since the Doctor shot that woman.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.778
To be fair, that was rough to watch...

01:51.904 --> 01:53.155
for all of us.

01:54.365 --> 01:58.494
That, uh, Jemma Simmons,
how well do you know her?

02:00.037 --> 02:02.039
Well enough to know she's on our side.

02:02.665 --> 02:08.670
You know, she claims that the Doctor
isn't evil, that he's been brainwashed.

02:09.003 --> 02:12.466
- Do you buy that?
- I've heard crazier things.

02:13.008 --> 02:18.055
Hmm. Well, crazy or not,
I want to know what else she's hiding.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.474
<i>Squid-mobile coming your way.</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:22.726
Here we go.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.564
Hey!

02:27.356 --> 02:30.442
Hey! There's someone trapped in the car!
I need help!

02:30.734 --> 02:33.654
Hands on your head.
Down on your knee, or you'll be shot.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.826
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't see the car,
I swear.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.412
I think she was drunk or something.
She swerved right into me.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.845
Little heads-up would be nice.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.140
Skye?

03:05.352 --> 03:06.437
I hope not.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.996
Thank you, gentlemen.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.217
- Why are you doing this, Fitz?
- It's Dr Fitz.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.513
And unlike the men who just left,
I know the truth about you...

03:42.723 --> 03:43.974
and your world.

03:45.351 --> 03:48.437
- You mean our world?
- Ah, don't try that ploy with me.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.065
- I know you replaced the real Skye.
- Replaced?

03:52.191 --> 03:55.277
- Is that what she told you?
- Somehow you conquered Hydra

03:55.402 --> 03:57.821
in your world, and now you want
to conquer ours.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.708
All I want is to get out of here.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.670
Tell me where the Patriot is.

04:14.964 --> 04:17.591
- I don't know.
- Did he come from your world, too?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.178
We all did, you included.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.598
- And the other subversive, Jemma Simmons?
- She's not a subversive.

04:24.848 --> 04:28.560
- Where is she?
- If I knew, I would tell you...

04:29.311 --> 04:34.900
because if anyone could get you to wake up
and realise that this nightmare

04:34.984 --> 04:36.777
isn't real, it's her.

04:38.779 --> 04:43.742
She loves you and you love her
and she's a real person,

04:43.867 --> 04:47.871
not a Hydra murder-bot who's got
your brain...

04:48.914 --> 04:52.001
The carrot or the stick?

04:52.126 --> 04:57.214
When neither motivates the truth,
we face unspeakable choices.

05:00.718 --> 05:03.095
What happened to you, Fitz?

05:06.181 --> 05:07.349
This is my home.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.644
I'm not gonna let you destroy it.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.023
We'll get to yours first.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.902
And when we do, the Patriot and all
of his kind...

05:19.653 --> 05:21.530
will pay for ever setting foot here.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.180
I should've had better judgment that day.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.183
Best not to dwell on the past.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.353
- What's important is our future.
- No.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.981
It's the present we need to worry about.

05:57.775 --> 06:02.404
The Inhuman threat keeps growing.
The Patriot hijacked a prison transport.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.031
It's time we take him out.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.909
I admire your resolve, Agent May.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.204
The truth is, we may have a weapon
that can beat him...

06:11.288 --> 06:12.873
but there are risks involved.

06:17.628 --> 06:20.047
It's only a risk if you have something
to lose.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.549
Are you volunteering for the task?

06:27.096 --> 06:29.014
Hail Hydra.

06:32.017 --> 06:35.312
- Where did they come from?
- We intercepted a bus

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
on the way
to a Hydra Enlightenment Centre.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.611
- Your girlfriend, Skye?
- No, thankfully.

06:43.862 --> 06:49.034
- Where's your daughter? How is she doing?
- I don't know. She's still rattled.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.037
She hides it, but they came into our home,
you know?

06:52.162 --> 06:55.290
Well, she's definitely safer here
than there. You both are.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.294
Look, this... this is all new to me but...

07:00.379 --> 07:02.464
I want to help. I owe you that.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.056
You can start with the bus outside.
We need to switch the plates,

07:11.140 --> 07:14.184
- the digital tags, and wipe the GPS.
- You're gonna put it to use?

07:14.351 --> 07:16.687
One of our operatives got caught trying
to smuggle out intel

07:16.770 --> 07:18.981
on a new Hydra weapon. They've got
him locked up at the centre.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.067
- The bus is our way in.
- 'Nuff said. I'm on it.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.280
You get anything more out of that woman,
Miss Simmons?

07:26.822 --> 07:30.534
No. She's stonewalling me.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.369
Not for long.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.707
Here. Let me get you
a couple of blankets.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.504
- Did you find Daisy?
- No, just a bus full of dead bodies.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.884
Binary ones and zeroes can't die,
nor do they feel the cold.

07:47.050 --> 07:50.387
- Maybe we keep that part between us.
- We're wasting time.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.515
We should be focused on getting Daisy back
and escaping this horrible place.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.100
Well, we can't do that
without Mace's help,

07:55.184 --> 07:57.311
- and he's already suspicious of you.
- I'm going to tell him the truth.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.731
- Not a good idea right now. Trust me.
- Mace is risking his life going

08:00.814 --> 08:04.318
on these pointless missions. So are you.
They don't matter in the real world.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.696
If you put it like that, "the real world,"
he'll never buy it, the Doctor,

08:07.779 --> 08:10.073
the creepy robots, the blue soap,
none of it.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.285
- He deserves to know.
- He doesn't have fragments of memories

08:13.410 --> 08:15.704
to draw on. Neither does Ward.
They're not like me.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.917
No, no one is, unfortunately,
especially not Ward.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.170
Okay, I got to ask,
what is it about that guy?

08:23.337 --> 08:26.840
Every time I see him, I get
this weird itch, like hives.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.550
Did we get along?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.429
Well, you crushed his chest
with your cybernetic arm

08:33.514 --> 08:36.808
and left him for dead on an alien planet,
so no.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.394
Wh...

08:41.104 --> 08:45.275
- He's behind me, isn't he?
- Miss Simmons, we'd like a word.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.777
It's "Doctor."

08:50.989 --> 08:53.659
I was told R and D has a new weapon,
something that could take down

08:53.784 --> 08:55.827
- the Patriot.
- Ah, yes.

08:56.203 --> 09:01.291
Oh, no, it's not exactly a weapon,
but it can make you into one.

09:06.421 --> 09:09.091
- Steroids?
- Oh no, not just any steroids.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.844
Augmented strength serum, the effects
of which are very potent,

09:12.928 --> 09:13.971
although temporary.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.100
- It's not Terrigen-based, is it?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

09:18.225 --> 09:22.604
This is made from various
metabolic enhancers, gorilla testosterone,

09:22.771 --> 09:27.234
even a dash of peppermint. The point is,
one dose, you will have the Patriot

09:27.317 --> 09:28.944
begging for his life.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.328
"A team that trusts is a team
that triumphs?" That's...

09:38.453 --> 09:42.249
- That's a little cheesy.
- You had t-shirts made, coffee mugs.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.919
Ugh. I realise how it sounds. No one wants
to hear they're just an avatar

09:46.003 --> 09:49.840
in a digital prison, but sometimes
that happens, and here we are.

09:50.924 --> 09:55.679
All that matters is getting out, and Daisy
and Dr Radcliffe are our keys to that.

09:56.888 --> 10:00.350
- Well, uh, think I need a drink.
- Urgh.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.312
In the, uh...

10:03.979 --> 10:06.898
in the real world, how well do we know
each other?

10:07.816 --> 10:08.900
Are we friends?

10:10.569 --> 10:13.572
More like co-workers. But I do think
of you in a friendly way.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.699
- Where am I from?
- Excuse me?

10:16.408 --> 10:20.537
- In your world, where am I from?
- Uh. I'm not sure.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.416
- The Mid-West?
- Well, am I married? Do I have kids?

10:24.499 --> 10:28.420
- Any siblings? Hobbies? Do I cook?
- Where are you going with this?

10:28.670 --> 10:31.089
You don't know me at all.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.092
Not well enough, apparently.

10:35.761 --> 10:40.432
I'm from Brooklyn, son of a plumber,
played baseball in college and guitar,

10:40.515 --> 10:43.977
can't carry a tune. I say "soda,"
not "pop," and I like my barbecue sweet,

10:44.061 --> 10:47.314
not spicy. Never been married
or had kids...

10:48.523 --> 10:53.278
but in the last five years, I've buried 17
of my closest friends and family.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.989
Some of them died right in my arms...

10:58.825 --> 11:03.246
believing they were fighting
for something real, stopping hate.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.376
And you're telling me it's...

11:08.710 --> 11:11.129
- meaningless?
- I'm sorry.

11:12.714 --> 11:16.927
I didn't mean to offend. But if you
don't believe my story, you can ask Daisy

11:17.469 --> 11:20.597
- once we rescue her.
- You don't think I want that?

11:21.431 --> 11:24.434
She'd be free by now if I'd taken the shot
on the Doctor when I had the chance.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.311
There's the Grant Ward I remember.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.860
How do you know what you believe is true?

11:35.153 --> 11:38.115
How do you know it's not the other way
around, that you're not the one

11:38.198 --> 11:40.367
- waking up to reality?
- Because it's not possible.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.494
- Where is your proof?
- I don't need proof.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.371
- This can't be real.
- How?

11:44.538 --> 11:47.791
Because the man I love would
never execute someone in cold blood.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.836
- Fitz would never do that.
- He did.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.672
Miss Simmons.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.428
I know you've been through a lot.
We all have.

12:00.387 --> 12:05.475
But what we do here matters, and you
can never convince me otherwise.

12:16.361 --> 12:20.699
What do you think?
Delusional? PTSD?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.326
I don't know.

12:25.620 --> 12:30.417
There might be a grain of truth
to her story. Find out what that is.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.046
Lies. That's all she gave us.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.762
Beaten to within an inch of her life.
Nevertheless...

12:43.013 --> 12:44.181
she persisted.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.185
- Let's see if she'll open up to me.
- You? Why?

12:50.145 --> 12:53.899
You and I have different methods.
It's why we work so well together.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.443
- I'll stay, then.
- Actually, I heard there was an issue

12:56.526 --> 12:59.571
with Project Looking Glass. I'd like you
to check in with security,

12:59.654 --> 13:00.906
see what happened.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.411
Of course.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.841
- Hello, Daisy.
- You know, I asked for a mani-pedi.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.261
Got tortured instead.

13:24.513 --> 13:28.517
- B.T. Dubs, your psycho-prison sucks.
- This isn't a prison.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.605
All I did was fix one thing
in everyone's life, a regret.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.569
The subsequent world is simply
a consequence of your actions,

13:39.903 --> 13:45.116
algorithms running their natural course,
as Dr Radcliffe always intended.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.078
This isn't what I meant,
you sadistic witch!

13:48.578 --> 13:50.789
Guard!

13:54.751 --> 13:58.755
Dr Radcliffe is clearly still suffering
the consequences of the errors he made.

13:59.548 --> 14:00.924
If I had my powers...

14:02.300 --> 14:06.221
I can't give you those,
but I can give you something else...

14:07.472 --> 14:10.600
something that will make all the pain
go away.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.895
- You have no idea what that even...
- Lincoln Campbell.

14:19.568 --> 14:22.612
Think of it.
You can live a peaceful life...

14:23.947 --> 14:25.073
have kids...

14:26.074 --> 14:30.704
grow old together with no memory
of what's happened here or there,

14:31.246 --> 14:32.414
no regrets...

14:34.332 --> 14:35.584
just each other.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.046
In exchange for?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.341
Just tell me where you are
in the other world...

14:44.843 --> 14:47.804
- and I'll bring Lincoln back.
- You can do that?

14:49.973 --> 14:53.852
'Cause you're the puppet master,
aren't you? Pulling all the strings.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.523
I'm just giving people what they want.
Why is that wrong?

15:00.108 --> 15:04.237
Because sometimes what people want
isn't right for them.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.157
I can fix that.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.786
And what do you get out of all of this?

15:15.206 --> 15:16.499
What everyone else has.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.878
A choice.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.392
- Have we IDed everyone yet?
- About half. I can start notifying

15:34.517 --> 15:36.645
- families as soon as...
- No, I want to do that myself

15:36.728 --> 15:40.607
when we get back. Leaving in ten.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.985
Sir, the plates are switched,
the transponder's toast.

15:44.069 --> 15:48.323
- There's no way Hydra can track the bus.
- Fast work. What's with the sat-radio?

15:48.573 --> 15:51.201
Well, I noticed the bus had
a comms system, so I decrypted it

15:51.284 --> 15:54.871
and synced it up with this. So, now we can
listen in on Hydra's transmissions

15:54.955 --> 15:58.208
- and maybe steal some intel.
- You, my friend,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.002
- are gonna fit right in here.
- Well, I can do more.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.546
If you need a driver, I got a lead foot.

16:04.172 --> 16:09.386
I appreciate the offer, but another
lead-footed soul already volunteered.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.183
I saw Mace briefly.
You told him, didn't you?

16:15.308 --> 16:18.269
I knew I was losing him when his
complexion changed from oatmeal

16:18.353 --> 16:19.604
to water chestnut.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.565
Shades of flesh colour programmed
into the Framework.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.652
Fitz believed even empty vessels needed
variety.

16:25.944 --> 16:29.030
You mean Dr Fitz, the guy
from my history book?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.868
Honestly, you really shouldn't pay
much attention to what's in there.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.830
I taught it for years. It's more fiction
than fact.

16:38.540 --> 16:42.127
Hi, Dad. Did you know
that those Hydra books lied to us?

16:42.210 --> 16:44.587
I guess you finished
doing your homework, huh?

16:44.713 --> 16:47.215
- Can I go check out the old Quinjet?
- Oh, come on, Sparkplug,

16:47.298 --> 16:49.467
you know you don't need a Quinjet to fly.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.137
- You know that, right?
- Mack?

16:53.513 --> 16:54.639
Yeah, that's right.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.560
I'm sorry. Have we met?

16:59.728 --> 17:03.314
Phil Coulson. I was here when you
first came in. This is Jemma Simmons.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.818
Oh, it's good to meet you.
This little girl right here,

17:06.901 --> 17:08.569
this is my daughter, Hope.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.909
- It's lovely to meet you, Hope.
- Nice to meet you, British lady.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.164
And is Hope's mother here,
as well?

17:19.580 --> 17:22.459
No, no, it's just me and Sparkplug.
Hey, you hungry?

17:23.001 --> 17:25.712
When was the last time you had something
to eat? And candy doesn't count.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.006
It's good to meet you.
Excuse me.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.303
Coulson, you got a second?

17:38.391 --> 17:42.145
Pulled this ID off one of the bus crew.
Should get you past the gate.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.273
Ward just had to swap the photo,
change the name.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.484
Jamie Flugelman?

17:48.151 --> 17:50.987
Well, it's the only one he could clear
from Hydra's database,

17:51.071 --> 17:53.448
so mount up, Flugelman.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.701
<i>How'd the security breach come
to your attention?</i>

17:57.202 --> 18:01.915
His co-worker spotted him hiding some
contraband in his locker, a camera.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.667
- Was there any film in it?
- No. No film.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.462
It was an antique, actually.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.133
Still, we shipped him off
to an Enlightenment Centre...

18:13.093 --> 18:15.470
for a refresher course on protocols.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.229
Haven't been down here in a while.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.607
How's the project going?

18:30.485 --> 18:33.154
Are you all right, son?
You look troubled.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.741
It's 'cause I am.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.205
Let me guess, a woman.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.001
Is it that obvious?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.297
It's a bit early for a pint.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.508
How about a cup of tea?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.471
Come on. Tell your old man all about it.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.154
- ID.
- Yeah.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.367
- Flugelman?
- It's Canadian.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.996
I don't have you on the entry logs.
You coming from the Triskelion?

19:23.079 --> 19:28.960
Yeah, I'm... I'm new, actually.
Just filling in for the other guy.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.596
How about that story on Bakshi News
the other day?

19:39.804 --> 19:43.349
That Inhuman they found with lion paws
for hands. So weird.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.851
Just the paws.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.649
Finally.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.527
You're all set.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.113
- Hail.
- Back at ya.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.715
Everything here tastes
like tofu!

20:19.719 --> 20:22.555
Put me out of my misery already!
What do you want from me?

20:22.639 --> 20:26.851
You've already taken my home, my dignity,
my pride!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.853
My...

20:32.148 --> 20:33.274
Agnes.

20:51.876 --> 20:56.881
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm laughing with utter joy.

20:57.423 --> 21:01.469
Yeah, well, you won't get any sympathy
from me.

21:02.762 --> 21:07.934
Sounds like you're getting everything
you deserve for creating this hellscape.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.312
You can say whatever you want.
Nothing hurts me anymore.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.148
Not after what he did to Agnes.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.736
- What happened?
- Fitz.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.698
I begged him not to...

21:23.157 --> 21:24.158
but he...

21:26.619 --> 21:28.955
killed her right in front of me.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.583
She was all I had.

21:38.089 --> 21:42.385
- How could he do that?
- Because that's who he is here.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.930
- Aida changed him.
- She said she took away one regret.

21:46.222 --> 21:51.894
One regret can't change an entire life.
It... it doesn't change who you are.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.438
Of course, it can.

21:54.397 --> 21:58.651
One person in your life, one decision,
one sentence has the power

21:58.735 --> 22:01.154
- to change you forever.
- One sentence?

22:01.321 --> 22:05.867
Yeah, that's right. One single sentence
like...

22:08.536 --> 22:09.662
"I love you"...

22:11.873 --> 22:12.874
or...

22:14.375 --> 22:16.627
"We're having a baby," or uh...

22:19.672 --> 22:20.840
"She's gone."

22:23.217 --> 22:24.344
I just...

22:25.678 --> 22:28.431
I didn't think Fitz was capable of doing
something like that.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.100
Oh, my dear.

22:31.726 --> 22:34.771
Depending on the circumstances,
anyone is capable of anything.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.356
Just look around.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.487
Please tell me that you built a back door
to this place

22:42.945 --> 22:44.822
and that Aida hasn't destroyed it.

22:45.615 --> 22:48.451
I did, and she can't.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.453
Yes.

22:51.079 --> 22:55.291
- Finally, some daylight.
- She might have installed some safeguards.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.168
Just... just tell me where to go.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.129
All right.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.423
Listen carefully.

23:04.801 --> 23:05.927
Hail Hydra.

23:06.761 --> 23:11.974
- My son, the Doctor himself.
- Stop. It means nothing.

23:12.308 --> 23:15.728
Why are you so down on yourself?
Is it something Ophelia said?

23:16.020 --> 23:17.188
No, it's not about her.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.982
- Are you seeing someone else?
- No.

23:21.484 --> 23:24.695
- Are you mad?
- So, what's this about a woman?

23:27.698 --> 23:31.786
- Someone I had to kill.
- "Had to"? You mean in self-defence?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.539
No, she was unarmed.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.749
Was she an enemy of the state?

23:38.418 --> 23:39.544
Yeah.

23:40.294 --> 23:41.671
I believe she was.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.006
So, what's the problem?

23:49.470 --> 23:50.555
What if...

23:51.806 --> 23:53.558
I didn't need to kill her?

23:54.350 --> 23:59.147
What if maybe she wasn't lying
or maybe she was...

24:00.440 --> 24:03.401
- mentally ill or something?
- "What if? Maybe."

24:03.943 --> 24:05.736
Now, that's your mother talking.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.658
- Sorry, Father.
- There she is again.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.785
Listen, son...

24:13.828 --> 24:17.957
I don't know a thing about what you do
here, the science...

24:19.292 --> 24:23.921
but I know that it's important, and I know
the man I raised, not a coward...

24:24.589 --> 24:30.094
but a man of action, a great man
in a hard world. And in a hard world,

24:30.553 --> 24:34.474
- we cannot afford the luxury of what?
- The luxury of sympathy.

24:34.682 --> 24:39.145
Exactly. We don't buckle to guilt
or womanly sentiment.

24:40.229 --> 24:45.109
Everyone needs the strap across their back
now and again. Teaches respect.

24:46.110 --> 24:50.406
You know that. You've felt it.
And look where it's gotten you.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.117
You're protecting the human race...

24:54.744 --> 24:58.831
and the only other person who understands
the weight of that is Ophelia...

24:59.624 --> 25:00.750
Madame Hydra.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.421
And you love her, don't you?

25:13.221 --> 25:16.307
Honestly don't know what kind of man
I'd be without you, Father.

25:16.474 --> 25:17.892
That's why I'm here, son.

25:31.531 --> 25:32.990
What are these?

25:35.117 --> 25:37.161
You know, disposal's on the other side
of the grounds.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.581
Disposal?
That's an ugly way of putting it.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.336
Hydra really ought to have a little more
respect for the dead.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.509
And the living, while you're at it.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.815
Guy we're looking for has some
important intel, so we get in, find them,

26:05.940 --> 26:08.901
- get out, quick and quiet.
- Hopefully we got the right place.

26:09.151 --> 26:12.196
Pretty sure this is it.
Branding is everything.

26:12.321 --> 26:16.367
"Enlightenment Cultivation Centre."
And everybody buys it.

26:16.492 --> 26:22.331
I sold their lies every day,
watched kids get taken out of my classroom

26:22.790 --> 26:25.626
because they were different,
because they asked questions.

26:27.169 --> 26:29.046
And it forced you into action.

26:31.841 --> 26:35.177
Burrows, keep an eye out for security.
Agent Flugelman and I have

26:35.344 --> 26:36.679
a friend to find.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.360
They call this rehab?

26:51.777 --> 26:56.198
Let's get them out.
Okay, time to go.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.960
Thought I was done for.
It's good to see you guys.

27:08.502 --> 27:12.798
Phil Coulson, meet Antoine Triplett,
my good friend and inside man.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.508
Nice to meet you, Trip.

27:15.051 --> 27:18.554
Trip? Haven't heard that nickname
since high school. How'd you know?

27:19.180 --> 27:22.850
- Felt right.
- Everyone on the bus. Let's go.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.811
- As soon as I find my boots.
- We'll get you another pair.

27:25.895 --> 27:28.230
It's not about the boots.
It's what's in them.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.071
- How confident are you about this report?
- No other centre reported

27:35.154 --> 27:38.407
any unscheduled drops today.
It has to be the Patriot.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.076
Very well, then.

27:45.289 --> 27:49.627
Shh. Shh. Take a few deep breaths.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.337
Burns going in, but should wear off.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.590
You've got about an hour
of augmented strength.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.344
Don't waste it.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.364
Hydra had a plan.
I'll give them that.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.701
Scare everyone, take over the media,
rewrite history.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.204
You know what's not in that book?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.333
The Trail of Tears. The Holocaust.

28:30.418 --> 28:33.504
- Martin Luther King Jr.
- I can't believe it.

28:34.255 --> 28:39.969
The blatant lies, the complete disregard
for historical or scientific fact.

28:40.094 --> 28:41.095
Yeah.

28:42.388 --> 28:46.559
That's why, in my house, I'm the judge
of what's fact or fiction.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.855
"Did you clean your room?
Well, I'll be the judge of that."

28:51.397 --> 28:54.442
- Dad, watch. I can do five in a row.
- Five times? Really?

28:54.734 --> 28:57.027
This I got to see.
Excuse me.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.703
Ah!

29:10.291 --> 29:13.377
- What are you smiling at?
- Same thing you are.

29:18.048 --> 29:23.012
Big, fake dad loving his little fake kid
in this crazy fake world.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.681
All right. Yeah, can we play
around it?

29:25.931 --> 29:27.767
I finally get why you don't like me.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.521
- You think I'm someone I'm not.
- Forget I said anything.

29:32.772 --> 29:36.525
You don't believe me
and I can't really look at you.

29:37.109 --> 29:39.528
Wow.

29:40.946 --> 29:44.575
What did I do in this other reality?

29:46.243 --> 29:47.286
Did I hurt someone?

29:49.872 --> 29:50.956
Did I kill someone?

29:53.417 --> 29:54.460
More than one.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.257
For what it's worth...

30:02.092 --> 30:03.344
for whatever I did do...

30:05.304 --> 30:06.388
I'm truly sorry.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.685
Look at them.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.563
You feel that, don't you?

30:16.357 --> 30:19.276
- The way he loves his kid?
- Of course.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.696
Then doesn't that make it real?

30:25.825 --> 30:28.994
<i>Cultivation Centre.
Code 10-14. Repeat, code 10-14.</i>

30:29.078 --> 30:30.746
- What is that?
- It's a potential breach.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.997
They've been discovered.

30:34.542 --> 30:38.087
Got to be here somewhere.
Where the hell are my boots?

30:38.921 --> 30:42.591
- Okay, I'll bite. What's in them?
- My grandfather was a Howling Commando.

30:42.758 --> 30:46.262
- Had an old-school spy camera.
- Which you snuck into Hydra's labs?

30:46.387 --> 30:49.056
- Nice.
- Yeah. Took some pictures in the lab,

30:49.139 --> 30:52.893
- hid the film in my boot heel.
- Pictures of what? Technical specs?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.479
Some kind of plans, yeah.
The Doctor's been working

30:55.563 --> 30:59.024
on a secret project, something to kill off
the Inhumans, from what I heard.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.821
Son of a... What kind of man steals
another man's boots?

31:08.284 --> 31:10.536
- It's Chris.
- Who?

31:10.953 --> 31:12.162
He was a student of mine.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.582
What's that building over there
where they're headed?

31:15.457 --> 31:18.252
Quarantine. It's where they take
all the kids.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.921
- Kids?
- Yeah.

31:21.714 --> 31:25.092
- Whoa, whoa. Where you going?
- Get the film to Mace.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.969
- Those plans are important.
- What about you?

31:27.595 --> 31:30.014
I let that kid down once.
I won't do it again.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.686
- You found it.
- Mission accomplished.

31:35.978 --> 31:39.398
But we got another problem. Your buddy
Phil took off after he saw some kid.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.692
Oh, Coulson. What's he thinking?

31:42.026 --> 31:44.445
Oh, that's not good.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.822
If Hydra's sending a Quinjet,
you can bet there's a hit team aboard.

31:46.947 --> 31:49.158
- They know we're here.
- What do you want to do?

31:50.701 --> 31:53.287
Burrows, take this film.
Bring it back to base. I'll get Coulson.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.122
- But, sir, how...
- Don't ask questions. Just do it.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.916
- I'll find us another way out.
- I know where he's going.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.960
I'll lead you to him.
Go on, B. Get out of here.

32:02.630 --> 32:03.714
You left them?

32:03.839 --> 32:06.383
<i>Those were his orders.
I'm carrying precious cargo.</i>

32:06.675 --> 32:08.886
All right, copy that, Burrows.
Over and out.

32:09.553 --> 32:12.806
Mace needs an extraction. I'm going in.
We lose him, our fight's over. Hydra wins.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.018
- How many people can you gather?
- Uh. Not many.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.646
Most people here are refugees.
Everyone else is out.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.106
Guess it's time to see what the big man
can do.

32:21.190 --> 32:22.942
No, not him.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.945
- Why not?
- Because he shouldn't go.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.864
- I'll go in his place.
- I thought this world didn't mean anything

32:28.948 --> 32:31.992
- to you, that it wasn't real.
- It's not. It's just...

32:32.618 --> 32:36.622
what happens to Mack here happens
in both worlds. He's... different.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.709
So, this has nothing to do
with that little girl over there?

32:45.756 --> 32:48.509
Fine. Let's go, partner.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.930
- How many people are in Quarantine?
- Don't know. Never been inside.

32:54.723 --> 32:57.351
Move!

32:58.185 --> 33:00.062
Go get Coulson. I'll handle her.

33:00.354 --> 33:01.855
I've been waiting for this.

33:02.982 --> 33:07.361
Someone's been juicing. Unless, of course,
you're one of us now.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.175
<i>Calm your mind.
You know what is best.</i>

33:30.426 --> 33:34.847
<i>What is best is you comply.
Compliance will be rewarded.</i>

33:35.347 --> 33:40.894
<i>Surrender, and you will find meaning.
Surrender, and you will find release.</i>

33:41.145 --> 33:46.608
<i>Take a deep breath. Calm your mind.
You know what is best.</i>

33:46.734 --> 33:51.655
<i>What is best is you comply.
Compliance will be rewarded.</i>

33:52.322 --> 33:54.700
<i>Surrender, and you will find meaning.</i>

33:54.867 --> 33:56.160
- Burnell?
<i>- Surrender,</i>

33:56.243 --> 33:59.663
<i>and you will find release.
Take a deep breath.</i>

34:00.289 --> 34:03.417
<i>- Calm your mind. You know what is best.</i>
- Chris?

34:03.751 --> 34:05.711
<i>- What is best is you comply.</i>
- Chris.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.297
<i>Compliance will be rewarded.</i>

34:08.922 --> 34:12.426
<i>- Surrender, and you will find meaning...</i>
- Damn, this is messed up.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.927
Just tell me that bus hasn't left yet.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.860
Figured you couldn't beat them,
so join them?

34:45.626 --> 34:47.753
You're a terrorist, a thug.

34:48.212 --> 34:50.797
If I was, you'd be dead right now.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.178
This is Agent May.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.348
The Patriot is here, but he got away
from me.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.643
<i>I think the serum's wearing off.
My strength's fading.</i>

35:06.021 --> 35:07.856
Isn't there a Quinjet on site?

35:10.567 --> 35:11.652
Yeah.

35:12.152 --> 35:15.489
That could work. Where did the Patriot go?

35:16.323 --> 35:17.991
<i>He ran into the Quarantine building.</i>

35:18.325 --> 35:19.827
<i>I don't know who's in there.</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:21.829
Does it matter?

35:22.913 --> 35:25.541
Bring it down and bring me the body.

35:26.542 --> 35:30.671
Copy that. Q-5, you have your order.
Fire on the Quarantine building.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.195
- Stay close and try not to shoot me.
- Come on.

35:56.697 --> 35:58.323
Come on.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.660
Run for the fence just past
those buildings. Don't stop.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.707
- Trip.
- Antoine, what happened?

36:06.790 --> 36:08.458
The ceiling's caved in.
They're trapped inside.

36:08.667 --> 36:09.877
Need your help. Come on.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.095
Come on.

36:20.596 --> 36:23.056
- Oh, my God.
- Simmons, get out of here.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.726
The whole place is about to come down.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.938
Chris!

36:36.737 --> 36:37.738
No!

36:48.957 --> 36:51.543
The building's unstable, Agent May.
You can't go in.

36:52.502 --> 36:54.671
I need verification
that the Patriot's dead.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.506
If he's not...

36:56.673 --> 36:57.966
...he will be.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.093
Activating body cam. Going in.

37:09.269 --> 37:11.688
Wait! Don't shoot!
Th... They need help up there.

37:15.901 --> 37:20.530
This is Agent May. There are kids in here.
Why the hell are there kids in here?

37:27.120 --> 37:30.332
- Where's the Patriot?
- Put that gun down. We need help here.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.376
There's a kid buried under that pile
of rock.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.711
It's coming down.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.713
No, it... it's coming up.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.274
- Get him out.
- Nobody move!

37:55.941 --> 37:58.026
Are you insane? He's trying to save a kid.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.444
So was I.

38:00.028 --> 38:03.282
Agent May, he's is the only thing keeping
this building from falling down

38:03.365 --> 38:07.327
on all of us. You shoot him, we all die.

38:07.494 --> 38:09.788
We don't have time for this.
We got to save that kid.

38:10.038 --> 38:12.040
Form a chain. Find something to prop up
that beam.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.251
Either shoot us or help,

38:14.334 --> 38:16.420
but don't just stand there.
Snap out of it, May.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.465
You guys, better hurry!

38:22.968 --> 38:24.594
Hang on, Chris. I got you. Come on.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.471
Okay.

38:29.558 --> 38:31.893
- Okay, yeah.
- Thank you.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.355
This cabinet should hold!

38:36.148 --> 38:39.693
- It won't work. Get out.
- No! We're not going to leave you!

38:46.867 --> 38:49.161
- Coulson?
- I'm right here, Jeffrey. Hang on.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.748
- Go.
- No.

39:01.882 --> 39:03.133
Go!

39:10.223 --> 39:13.060
- No! No!
- Simmons, let's go!

41:29.905 --> 41:30.989
What?

41:32.365 --> 41:35.577
Is it true, that you're an Inhuman?

41:45.795 --> 41:49.758
Yeah. Powerful enough to bring
this whole damn place down.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.437
I hope so.
