WEBVTT

00:43.752 --> 00:47.088
The forest in spring.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.718
A time of renewal...

00:53.095 --> 00:55.304
...of rebirth...

00:56.640 --> 00:59.684
...of unbridled optimism...

01:02.104 --> 01:04.647
...when new beginnings begin...

01:04.815 --> 01:06.691
...and where the mighty mule deer...

01:06.859 --> 01:09.819
...prepares for his upcoming
mating ritual.

01:09.987 --> 01:15.158
One lucky doe will get to spend her life
with this fine specimen of a buck.

01:15.325 --> 01:19.370
His magnificent antlers,
a testament to his great prowess...

01:19.538 --> 01:23.624
...his strength, his masculinity,
his awesomeness!

01:23.792 --> 01:26.836
His super-incredible coolness!

01:27.004 --> 01:29.172
His amazing kick-butt-ocity!

01:29.339 --> 01:32.008
- Ladies and gentlemen, here I...
- All right, Elliot.

01:32.176 --> 01:34.135
Enough about your new rack
already, man.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.763
Aye. Give it a rest,
you freak of nature.

01:36.930 --> 01:40.266
- We grow tiresome of this talk of rack.
- It's true. We do.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.851
- He's right, you know.
- Boring.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.687
Like I never talk
about anything else.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.440
Have you seen my new horns?
They're completely natural.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.859
All me. Yes!

01:50.027 --> 01:52.904
That tree is huge.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.490
Like my antlers! Yeah!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.408
Yes!

01:59.536 --> 02:01.245
Oh, my rack is huge.

02:01.413 --> 02:02.955
Yes!

02:04.082 --> 02:06.959
Well, this time,
I have something big to say.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.670
You know, not as big as my antlers.
I got you again, yes!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.507
- Nailed it!
- Oh, come on.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.343
- We got a ceremony to get to.
- Okay, okay, okay.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.553
I'd just like to thank you...

02:17.721 --> 02:20.348
...Boog, Mr. Weenie, Buddy,
Serge, Deni and McSquizzy...

02:20.516 --> 02:24.227
...my closest, dearest friends,
for being here for me...

02:24.394 --> 02:28.523
...on the most important day
of my life.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.316
Yeah. You're welcome. Now, let's...

02:30.484 --> 02:32.985
Unfortunately, the bachelor buck
stops here.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.571
But I begin a new chapter
with Giselle...

02:35.739 --> 02:39.408
...my doe, my deer, my female deer.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.537
- That's a really nice thought...
- As my single life ends...

02:42.704 --> 02:46.165
...finishes, expires, perishes...

02:46.333 --> 02:51.087
...goes down in a blazing ball
of flames with no survivors...!

02:51.255 --> 02:53.172
Elliot, relax.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.259
- Now, let's get a move on, man.
- Yeah, we go to the wedding.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.885
Wedding?

03:00.055 --> 03:01.681
- Nuptials.
- Okay, just one minute.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.642
- Let's get this over with.
- Hold on. Be right there.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.144
Just polished these boys,
don't wanna scratch them.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.480
Hurry, Elliot! Come on.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.776
I'm falling.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.279
- Careful!
- Oh, snap.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.489
- Too late.
- Oh, that was smooth.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.867
Elliot, don't look.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.703
- Oh, he looked.
- He's going to blow.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.371
Everybody, duck!

03:33.505 --> 03:35.756
- Was that Elliot?
- I'm telling you...

03:35.924 --> 03:39.176
...when you're in love, you hear
your man's voice everywhere.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.388
- You know it, girl.
- You got that right.

03:43.682 --> 03:47.184
Oh, Maria.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.146
- Thank you, Rosie.
- Our sweet Giselle's getting hitched.

03:50.314 --> 03:54.150
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh, it's okay.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.779
- Elliot?
- Well, hello there, ladies.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.157
- Oh, hi, Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.784
Just want to inform you
that the ceremony begins...

04:03.952 --> 04:05.661
...at 0800 hours.
- Good to know.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.581
If it all goes according to plan...
And it will.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.375
- We'll finish up at 0900 hours...

04:11.543 --> 04:14.629
...with a berry and dewdrop
reception brunch to follow.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.839
- Great. Thanks, Ian.
- Not a problem.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.050
Oh, and, Giselle,
there's still some time...

04:19.216 --> 04:22.511
...if you'd rather be served some
beefcake instead of the pansy-loaf...

04:22.679 --> 04:24.305
...if you know what I mean.

04:24.473 --> 04:25.806
And I think you do.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.435
I don't generally
go for venison, but...

04:29.603 --> 04:31.729
...girl, that dish is fine.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.689
- Don't you know it.
- Don't you know it.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.899
No, thank you.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.693
Elliot is all the man I'll ever need.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.200
My rack. My beautiful rack.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.536
Stop boo-hooing, you wee jessie.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.206
- They'll grow back.
- Yeah, they're gonna grow back.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.375
Just like the last time
you broke them' man.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.876
And the time before that.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.253
- And the time before that.
- What if it's a sign?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.005
- A sign not to get...
- Get what?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.882
- Married.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.510
See this here? Now, this is sad.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.887
- Poor Elliot.
- We need a diversion.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.223
Hey, I know just the diversion...

05:07.391 --> 05:10.893
...to take his mind off his antler.
We break his hoof with a large stone.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.312
- Yeah, a large stone!
- A boulder.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.982
I can't believe it. I mean, I can't...

05:17.734 --> 05:21.028
I know what you're do...
Seriously, quit it...

05:21.196 --> 05:23.739
- I can totally see what you're doing.
- Come on, Elliot.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.827
If there's one thing
I am not in the mood for...

05:27.995 --> 05:32.790
...it is a rabbit fight!
- Rabbit fight!

05:34.710 --> 05:35.876
Gregalach!

05:36.795 --> 05:38.838
You're going down, fat bear!

05:39.006 --> 05:40.673
Stay!

05:41.383 --> 05:43.050
Sit.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.885
Now, count to 10.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.974
What are you doing?
He's getting away.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.644
Boog gave me a command
to count to 10, so I...

05:54.938 --> 05:57.064
I can't believe I fell for that.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.941
I must never be weak again.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.111
You don't know what it was like
living with the humans.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.948
If they say "sit", you sit.
If they say "fetch", you fetch.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.617
You must stay alert,
or they will steal our freedom...

06:08.785 --> 06:12.371
...and lock us up forever und ever.
- Forever und ever?

06:13.457 --> 06:15.624
But you broke free.
How did you do it?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.836
- What's the secret?
- Never forget who you are in here.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.087
A vulnerable child...

06:20.255 --> 06:22.048
...who just wants to be loved?
- No!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.800
A wild animal who relies
on no one but himself.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.887
- Now, say it with me. I'm wild!
- I'm wild.

06:28.055 --> 06:32.183
- With conviction. I'm wild!
- I'm wild!

06:35.312 --> 06:37.980
Now, let's go find the fat bear.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.693
I can't believe it, Bob.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.946
It's been a whole year
since we saw Mr. Weenie.

06:46.114 --> 06:49.366
I know he's still out there.
I can feel it.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.035
Can you feel it, Bob?

06:51.203 --> 06:54.330
- Well, I...
- Mr. Weenie! Mr. Weenie!

06:54.498 --> 06:57.083
Do you think he'll find
our biscuit trail, Bob?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.168
Do you think he'll
come back to us, Bob?

06:59.336 --> 07:02.004
Do you think Mr. Weenie's
safe out there, Bob?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.925
Boog will never find me.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.639
Now, where is that Weenie?

07:11.807 --> 07:13.682
Guten tag, fat bear!

07:15.143 --> 07:17.269
I am victorious!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.814
Show-off. I'm gonna
have to check the rule book.

07:19.981 --> 07:23.067
Mortal combat!

07:29.825 --> 07:33.160
He got me! Great shot, Elliot.
You won, man.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.495
Nobody ever expects...

07:34.663 --> 07:37.206
...the falling-down-the-tree-in-pain
manoeuvre.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.375
- Very clever, mule deer.
- He cracks me up.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.086
- He surprised you good on that one.
- Oh, is that right?

07:42.254 --> 07:44.505
- It's true.
- Game over.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.924
All right, now, let's get cleaned up.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.593
- Time for Elliot to tie the knot.
- Already? No!

07:49.761 --> 07:51.679
This was the best stag party ever...

07:51.847 --> 07:54.473
...which has to keep going.
Please, rabbits to throw.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.142
Oh, grow up, you big baby.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.601
- Let's get moving.
- Boog...

07:57.769 --> 07:59.895
...do you think I'm doing
the right thing here?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.188
Marrying Giselle?

08:01.356 --> 08:05.734
What I'm wondering is,
is Giselle doing the right thing?

08:06.444 --> 08:07.862
I'm just kidding you.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.238
Now, will you relax?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.995
We're gathered today
for a very serious occasion.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.747
Elliot? What happened?

08:19.541 --> 08:21.417
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Nothing.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.252
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.046
I couldn't be better.
Just had a little trim off the top.

08:26.214 --> 08:28.591
Giselle and Elliot...

08:28.758 --> 08:33.011
...have courted and made the decision
to join together forever...

08:33.179 --> 08:34.221
...and ever.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.768
Is he okay?

08:39.936 --> 08:41.687
Forever and ever?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.688
Still time to change your mind.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.108
- What?
- Wait, I knew about forever.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.235
Guys, but what's this
about "and ever"?

08:48.403 --> 08:49.987
- Be cool.
- Nobody said anything...

08:50.155 --> 08:51.947
...about an additional "and ever".

08:56.786 --> 08:59.288
No! The food of oppression.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.081
I must be strong.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.629
Oh, maybe just a taste.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.510
I'd like to ask the buck
to step forward...

09:13.678 --> 09:17.306
...for a ceremonial displaying
of the antlers...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.266
Antler.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.977
- To show his commitment
to his doe.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.563
- Seriously. Still time.
- Not gonna happen.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.737
Oh, so good.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.448
I'm weak! How could I?

09:34.616 --> 09:38.535
- Do you, Giselle, take Smelliot...
- Ian.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.329
- To be your lifelong mate?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.665
I do.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.798
And do you, Elliot...

09:50.966 --> 09:54.301
...take Giselle to be
your lifelong mate?

09:55.178 --> 09:57.554
That's you. Your line.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.973
You go now.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.141
Elliot. Go on, man.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.227
- That's your cue. Go, go.
- Don't be shy.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.853
Come on. Say it, you ninny.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.274
Elliot, are you okay?

10:08.984 --> 10:11.527
Come on, step it up.
I got a buck mitzvah at 3.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.364
- Weenie! Weenie!
- Weenie?

10:15.532 --> 10:18.200
- What, are you speaking French?
- Weenie! Oh, no!

10:18.368 --> 10:21.036
Elliot? Where are you going?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.871
Weenie, come back!

10:23.331 --> 10:26.375
- Stop. Weenie!
- I must be strong.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.545
- Weenie! Weenie!
- So good.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.214
Weenie, over here! Weenie!
Here, boy!

10:32.674 --> 10:34.091
Weenie!

10:34.259 --> 10:36.885
Oh, no. Full moon.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.513
Is that you? Mr. Weenie!

10:40.557 --> 10:44.184
It's you! It's you!
I can't believe it's you!

10:44.728 --> 10:46.395
It's a miracle.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.398
He's been captured!

10:49.566 --> 10:51.233
- What am I gonna do?
- Bob, it worked!

10:51.401 --> 10:53.068
Oh, no, this is terrible.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.653
Everything is okay.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.905
Mommy is here.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.868
He's being tortured!

11:01.036 --> 11:02.077
No!

11:02.245 --> 11:04.079
- No!
- No!

11:04.247 --> 11:06.874
No!

11:10.253 --> 11:12.254
- What are you doing?
- What's this all about?

11:12.422 --> 11:15.007
- You better have a good explanation.
- Yes! Yes, I do.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.761
- Oh, I can't wait to hear this excuse.
- It was horrible.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.306
Weenie was minding his own
business when she appeared.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.017
He screamed,
but she ignored his cry.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.103
And then she grabbed him
with her claws.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.563
Oh, my goodness.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.941
Then she tried to squeeze
the life out of him.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.860
- That's horrible.
- Sad story.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.279
But he fought back.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.156
Oh, she tortured him.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.532
Slapped him.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.953
Poked his eyes out, like this.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.747
It was horrible!

11:46.915 --> 11:49.083
It was the worst thing I've ever seen!

11:49.250 --> 11:51.627
Oh, the humanity!

11:51.795 --> 11:54.797
Elliot, are you maybe putting
a little bit too much on that?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.924
Listen, Boog, I'm telling the story.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.761
And finally, the hairless blob
dragged him off...

12:00.929 --> 12:03.972
...into her chariot of horror!

12:05.308 --> 12:07.476
Wait, wait, wait.
So, what you're saying is...

12:07.644 --> 12:09.978
- Mr. Weenie's been kidnapped!
- No.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.480
- For real?
- Yes, it's true.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.899
- Tough break. I miss him already.
- What now?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.276
Well, we could finish the ceremony.
Come on.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.153
I worked hard on those centrepieces.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.739
As much as Elliot and I
wanna finish the ceremony...

12:20.907 --> 12:23.659
...we need to go after Mr. Weenie.
- Giselle's right!

12:23.827 --> 12:27.162
And until he's back in the safety
of our friends and family...

12:27.330 --> 12:30.082
...in the warm caress
of our bosoms...

12:30.250 --> 12:33.919
...there will be,
there can be, no celebration.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.089
So, what can we do? Probably
halfway to the valley's end by now.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.549
So? We can't give up.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.510
We didn't give up on the hunters
when they raided the forest.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.512
We can't give up on our friend
Weenie.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.681
The Boogster's right.
Who's with me?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.349
Oh, yeah. Count me in.

12:47.517 --> 12:51.145
- Me too.
- Okay. Good. Who else is in?

12:51.312 --> 12:54.356
I'm beeling at them bajins.
So let's quit bumping the gums...

12:54.524 --> 12:56.817
...and give them a right chibbing!

12:59.654 --> 13:02.656
I'm not sure what Squiz just said,
but I'll take that as a yes.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.033
- Yes! It's a yes!
- I'm in too.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.369
- Me too.
- I'm with you, buddy.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.246
Sorry, I got the wife and kids.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.707
You turn your back on the pelts
for one second...

13:11.875 --> 13:15.127
...all heck breaks loose. I'm out.
- Oh, leave it to the beaver.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.172
In your dreams.
I just had my nails done, girl.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.884
Sounds fun, but I gotta stay
back and protect the herd.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.971
You're all a bunch of meek-minded,
yellow-bellied, pansy-a...

13:26.139 --> 13:29.683
As McSquizzy is trying to say...

13:29.851 --> 13:32.352
...a smaller group
is probably better anyway.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.521
- We can move faster.
- Let's get a move on.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.565
Move out, boys.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.568
- Elliot?
- Yeah?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.987
You're going the wrong way,
you big daftie!

13:42.155 --> 13:44.740
I know that. Fall in.

13:50.872 --> 13:55.083
Oh, Mr. Weenie, we've been
looking for you for so long.

13:55.251 --> 14:00.380
It must've been horrible
out there all alone in the wild.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.758
Oh, no one's gonna believe it!

14:02.926 --> 14:05.469
Should I call the caravan, Bob?

14:05.637 --> 14:07.429
Breaker, breaker, Fox Jaws.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.266
- This is Mudflaps and Wild Man.
- Copy that. Over.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.601
You'll never guess.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.145
We found Mr. Weenie! It's true!

14:15.313 --> 14:18.023
Say hello, Mr. Weenie.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.901
- Did you hear that?
- Congrats, Mudflaps. Good to hear!

14:22.612 --> 14:27.115
What's that, Bob? Oh, Wild Man says
we need to make a pit stop for a fill-up.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.243
We'll see you
over at the campground.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.538
- Over.
- Breaker, breaker, happy travellers.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.915
Put your ears on,
I've got great news!

14:35.083 --> 14:39.795
Mudflaps and Wild Man found
their long-lost weenie dog! Over.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.303
Oh, man, is this good.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.639
Hey, Fifi, you want some?

14:50.807 --> 14:53.809
You know, Roberto,
those doggy treats...

14:53.977 --> 14:56.270
...are filled with carbohydrates.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.898
And if I could pronounce that word,
that would mean what?

15:00.066 --> 15:03.485
It would mean you should
stick to the lean proteins...

15:03.653 --> 15:05.279
...the meats, the poultries.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.990
How are you gonna look
sitting by the pool?

15:08.157 --> 15:11.952
- I don't know. Hot and really happy.
- That was rhetorical, moron.

15:12.120 --> 15:16.164
Put down the treats.
You've eaten enough.

15:19.961 --> 15:24.006
I'm going to pretend
I didn't see that.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.556
- Hey, Fifi?
- Yes?

15:32.724 --> 15:34.725
How long do you think it'll be
till we stop?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.936
Because I gotta poop.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.361
Seriously, I gotta poop really bad.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.323
I said it was going to be a long ride,
but you never listen.

15:49.490 --> 15:53.702
Just like you didn't listen when
I told you not to eat the entire burrito.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.540
Now, you know what this
means I have to do.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.459
Gosh, darn.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.211
Every time we leave the house,
you put me through this...

16:03.379 --> 16:05.547
Fifi! Fifi, stop!

16:05.715 --> 16:08.383
- Do you hear me?
- Come on. Help a brother out.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.887
What on earth has gotten
into that dog?

16:12.221 --> 16:15.140
You know I hate doing this.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.560
Yeah, but you do it so well.
Can you hurry it along?

16:18.728 --> 16:21.897
Oh, there you are baby, Fifi.

16:22.065 --> 16:25.108
One pit stop, coming up.

16:27.195 --> 16:29.279
Oh, gross.

16:29.447 --> 16:32.115
No, Fifi. No.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.118
Breaker, breaker. This is Fox Jaws.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.080
One of my little yappers just
served up a can of gut soup...

16:38.247 --> 16:42.709
...and we are talking chunky.
Let's pull off. Over.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.712
Come on, you dumb cat.
Get off the road.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.757
You two run along
while I get cleaned up.

16:48.925 --> 16:52.052
Out of my way. Out of my way.
I don't wanna be rude, but I gotta go.

16:52.220 --> 16:55.472
- Stanley, old buddy.
- Oh, here we go.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.058
Stanley, it's been ages.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.436
Actually, it's been exactly
one year, Roger.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.772
Really? It seems like
such a long time.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.441
Oh, I have to explain this again?

17:06.608 --> 17:11.154
Okay, listen, we go to Pet Paradiso
every year at the same time.

17:11.321 --> 17:15.492
And, painfully,
we have this same conversation.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.619
- We do?
- Yes. Yes, we do.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.373
Is this ringing a bell?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.626
Stanley, it's been ages.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.962
It's gonna be a long week.

17:27.130 --> 17:31.717
Oh, Rufus. There you are.
How's my shining star?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.593
Why, Charlene, look at you.

17:33.761 --> 17:37.639
Don't you look prettier than a glob
of butter on a stack of wheat cakes.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.058
Oh, goodness me.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.980
- Thank you, Rufus. Oh, may I?
- Well, I'd be much obliged.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.899
Hey, Fifi.
Did you hear they found Mr. Weenie?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.776
- Isn't that great?
- Really?

17:49.944 --> 17:53.238
- Are you sure?
- I heard he lived with wild animals.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.407
No. That's horrible.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.076
- He's lucky they didn't hurt him.
- Or kill him.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.162
Or worse.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.582
I was once in the vicious clutches
of wild animals.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.208
- You were?
- I was.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.085
What was it like?

18:07.253 --> 18:11.840
It's too painful for me to talk about.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.592
Gather round.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.677
Okay, Fifi.
You want the squeaky toy?

18:15.845 --> 18:17.429
There I was.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.972
- All alone.
- You want it?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.807
Alone in that steaming jungle.

18:20.975 --> 18:25.145
That unforgivable heart of darkness,
where you can't see your own paws.

18:25.313 --> 18:29.900
And the only sound is the frantic,
but adorable...

18:30.067 --> 18:32.360
...pitter-patter of your own heart.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.571
When suddenly...

18:40.203 --> 18:41.536
They were everywhere.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.290
There was no escape.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.544
My life flashed before my eyes,
and then the unspeakable.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.090
- What happened? Did you live?
- What happened?

18:54.258 --> 18:58.762
I'll show you what happened.

18:58.930 --> 19:02.307
Let this be a lesson to you all.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.560
- How ghastly.
- It's so pink.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.854
- That is one sad tail.
- I want a girlfriend.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.648
Don't interrupt now. Please?

19:09.816 --> 19:14.569
I lost two things on that day:
My innocence...

19:15.112 --> 19:17.072
...and my squeaky toy.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.992
Oh, you poor, sweet thing.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.081
Speak of the devil.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.251
- Disgusting.
- Oh, no.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.336
Not the fuzzy little bunny.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.214
Don't you understand?
We must remain vigilant.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.341
Even one wild animal among us...

19:36.509 --> 19:41.888
...can send us back to those dark days
of anarchy.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.057
Come on, but he's so cute.

19:44.475 --> 19:45.517
Pay attention.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.937
Even one little fuzzy bunny
can infest us all.

19:49.105 --> 19:53.275
Like the fleas on Roberto's back,
they must all be eradicated.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.279
I'm gonna tear you apart.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.451
Fifi! Heel!

20:06.330 --> 20:08.290
One day, you vile little beast.

20:08.457 --> 20:12.252
One day, I will personally
teach you a lesson...

20:12.420 --> 20:15.297
...you will never forget!

20:16.090 --> 20:18.133
I'm coming, Mother.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.470
Hey, does anybody
know where we are?

20:23.264 --> 20:24.806
Didn't think so.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.892
- Isn't this great, Boog?
- What's great?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.436
You know, not great that Weenie's
been kidnapped...

20:29.604 --> 20:32.105
...but great that we're living life
on the edge.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.732
It's just like old times.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.318
- Two guys, out on the road.
- Hey, guys.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.737
- Room for one more?
- For sure.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.989
So, Elliot...

20:41.157 --> 20:43.658
...now that we have
a moment alone...

20:46.954 --> 20:48.580
Hey, what's that?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.458
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened...

20:51.626 --> 20:53.084
...at the ceremony this morning.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.671
- What do you mean?
- Well, while I was saying, "I do"...

20:57.173 --> 21:00.258
...you were looking like you didn't.
- What?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.052
Giselle, don't be ridiculous.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.638
Look, Elliot,
I know something is bothering you.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.725
Ever since the ceremony,
you've been acting a little strange.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.519
We're partners.
You can tell me anything.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.356
All right, Giselle,
but remember, you asked.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.859
Basically, I'm worried about
"forever and ever".

21:18.027 --> 21:19.277
"Forever and ever"?

21:19.445 --> 21:22.948
About Mr. Weenie
being lost forever and ever.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.825
So this has nothing to do with me...

21:25.993 --> 21:28.203
...you're only worried
about Mr. Weenie...

21:28.371 --> 21:29.913
...right?
- Yes, I am.

21:30.081 --> 21:34.042
But I'm mostly worried about
you and me, our special day...

21:34.210 --> 21:35.961
...and getting back to the ceremony.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.881
But finding Mr. Weenie
could take a long, long time.

21:40.049 --> 21:43.218
Could take months, really.
I mean, years, perhaps.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.720
- A lifetime.
- Found him.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.138
There he is.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.057
- He's over there.
- She found him.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.309
- Oh, way to go, Giselle.
- Giselle.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.228
What luck, huh, Elliot?

21:53.396 --> 21:55.897
We'll be back home
and married in no time.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.358
Well, I mean,
that could be another RV, you know.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.777
- There's Weenie in the window.
- He's waving at us.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.404
- Here I am!
- Hi, Weenie.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.573
- He's... That's a totally different dog.
- Nope. That's him.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.950
We better keep looking.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.577
Come back. You know we gotta
go get him out of there.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.163
- Help! Help!
- No, I know that. I just...

22:12.331 --> 22:13.373
What was the question?

22:13.541 --> 22:15.750
- All right, here's the plan.
- That's all wrong.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.253
Squizmeister, you and Buddy
will be the entry team.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.921
- Roger.
- Serge, Deni.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.340
Smash and grab.
Boog, you're with me.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.842
Let's limit the casualties.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.969
- All right.
- What about me? What can I do?

22:26.137 --> 22:31.016
Well, yeah, that's right. What...
You stay there and guard the trees.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.352
- Really? That's the best you could do?
- No, Elliot. Wait.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.729
Hi there, folks.

22:35.896 --> 22:41.109
I'd like to offer a complimentary
32-point diagnostic inspection...

22:41.277 --> 22:42.610
...while I fill up your tank.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.279
- Restroom, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.947
- In the back.
- Thank you.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.284
And may I suggest you trying
our famous pecan roll?

22:49.452 --> 22:51.786
I make them myself. They're inside.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.329
For a buck.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.707
Two for $2.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.668
Off the road!

23:05.676 --> 23:08.595
Engine knock. Yep.
I'd know it anywhere.

23:09.013 --> 23:12.098
Come on. Let's go. Quiet.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.476
It's about time you got here, Boog.
Keep up.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.145
- Deni and I are ready.
- Me too.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.189
Oh, thank goodness.
You've come for me.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.398
No need to worry.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.817
Okay, we need a grappling hook,
a 30-foot rope...

23:22.985 --> 23:26.321
...winch, pulley, truck with an open
engine block and a can of sardines.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.406
Why don't we just
open the door, genius?

23:28.574 --> 23:31.326
- I'm trying to think outside the box.
- Okay, single file.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.328
- Stay quiet.
- Don't tell me to be quiet.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.580
Tell the ducks to be quiet.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.961
Weenie, it's all clear.
Come on. Let's go.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.714
- Yeah, coming through.
- We need a new plan.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.342
Everybody, quiet.
I need a minute to think.

23:47.510 --> 23:49.969
- Time's up.
- I got it.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.348
Plush.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.810
Face it, Earl.
These folks are living your dream.

23:58.521 --> 24:02.774
- That was close. I think we're clear.
- That's not part of the plan, Boog.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.193
- From now on...
- Hey, fatso, shove off.

24:05.361 --> 24:06.861
You're snapping my spine here.

24:07.029 --> 24:11.407
Oh, suspension is shot.
Definitely shot.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.868
Or it could be the bushings.

24:14.161 --> 24:17.288
Bob, which one should I get
for our Mr. Weenie-Baby?

24:17.456 --> 24:21.251
Stripes or plaid?
You're absolutely right.

24:22.378 --> 24:26.047
- Please don't leave me.
- Mr. E's got you covered.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.133
- Stand back.
- No.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.467
Let me take a look-see.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.056
Now, that is a sturdy piece
of hardware, right, guys?

24:35.224 --> 24:37.892
- I'm doomed.
- Doomed, huh? Yeah.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.562
Stay with me, boys. I got it.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.231
Now I have to top off the fluids.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.732
All right, go.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.697
Come on with it.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.866
Most likely the rear differential.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.077
I was right.

24:58.747 --> 25:02.083
Bob, should we get a pecan roll
for the ride?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.627
- Elliot, you okay?
- Hey.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.130
I'm getting sick and tired
of breaking your fall.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.339
Get off me!

25:08.507 --> 25:11.509
- Oh, yolk.
- It's okay, Elliot. I'm here.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.761
Oh, these cheese doodles
are so good.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.639
They really taste like cheese.

25:17.016 --> 25:19.767
Snack time over? Come on.
We need to focus.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.145
- Yeah. Focus on the Weenie.
- Come on, everybody.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.689
- What he said.
- Quiet. New plan.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.400
We need to lubricate the collar.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.110
Good idea.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.864
No, no. Something else, please.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.116
Oh, Bob, do you think
Mr. Weenie will like it?

25:35.284 --> 25:38.953
Hey, how about that pecan roll, huh?
Did I tell you?

25:39.121 --> 25:41.956
Hey, could you be a sport
and grab that ladder?

25:42.124 --> 25:43.166
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.959
- There's some more.
- Stop! Enough!

25:47.880 --> 25:49.214
I'm not gonna lie.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.216
It was a little scary up there.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.094
My spine! You're killing me.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.805
- That'll be $437.
- Incoming.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.599
- Or I'll trade you.
- Double-time.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.810
- Gas for that bearskin rug.
- I'm out of room.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.687
- I'm out of air.
- Swing wide.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.897
- Easy.
- Follow my lead.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.316
- Come on now.
- Pull.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.651
- Use your legs.
- Pull.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.323
Oh, my gosh.
Did you see that, Bob?

26:16.158 --> 26:17.492
The Weenie is free.

26:18.118 --> 26:19.577
Let's make a break for it, boys.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.163
Deni, follow me.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.874
- Gregalach!
- Run like the wind.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.627
Wait for me. I have teeny legs.

26:27.795 --> 26:30.338
- I'm out. I'm stuck.
- I did it.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.050
Take cover!

26:34.218 --> 26:35.843
Elliot, you fool.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.680
- Shake a leg, Weenie.
- What's going on in there?

26:38.847 --> 26:41.474
Mr. Weenie, are you okay?

26:42.226 --> 26:44.727
We did it. We're all safe, right?

26:44.895 --> 26:46.187
Okay, roll call.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.690
- Boog? McSquizzy? Deni? Serge?
- Here.

26:48.857 --> 26:49.857
- Weenie?
- There.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.067
- Where?
- Bye, now.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.360
Oh, no.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.989
Well, where's Buddy? Buddy?
Sound off, Buddy.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.032
Here.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.702
Well, you've screwed up again,
you one-horn dumpling.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.370
- How did that happen?
- Oh, Elliot.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.579
Imbecile.

27:03.747 --> 27:04.789
What do we do now?

27:04.957 --> 27:07.542
- We are missing two.
- Idiot.

27:07.710 --> 27:11.921
Blaming Elliot for blowing the escape
isn't gonna help us find Mr. Weenie.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.382
- No, but it's fun.
- Hey, what?

27:14.550 --> 27:16.175
- Giselle's onto something.
- She is?

27:16.343 --> 27:18.678
We need to find out
where that RV is going.

27:18.846 --> 27:23.433
I know. Serge, Deni, you guys fly off
and locate the RV from the sky.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.269
In the meantime, we'll stay
on their trail by foot.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.604
Everybody got it?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.857
- Smart girl.
- Oh, yeah.

27:31.025 --> 27:33.735
You call aerial surveillance
a good idea?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.697
- All right, General Giselle.
- What's with you?

27:37.865 --> 27:41.075
We're not even married yet, and
you're already telling me what to do.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.828
You need a little space?
All right, yeah. No problem.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.623
- I'm just trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- And there lies the problem.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.084
There's only room for one cook
in this kitchen...

27:50.252 --> 27:54.213
...and that one cook is me and Boog.
We're partners.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.258
- Oh, I get it.
- Finally.

27:57.426 --> 28:02.263
- This was starting to get awkward.
- Awkward? You call this awkward?

28:02.431 --> 28:05.767
What do you call running off in
the middle of our wedding ceremony?

28:05.934 --> 28:09.771
- I was trying to save Mr. Weenie.
- Oh, we're back to that excuse.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.607
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.
Simmer down, y'all.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.233
That's it. I'm going home.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.695
No one's going home.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.739
I think you should go home, Giselle.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.991
- You're just slowing us down.
- Whatever.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.118
No, she's not. You are.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.579
Boog?

28:27.956 --> 28:31.167
Look, man, we need Giselle.
She's a great tracker.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.836
Yeah, and without her,
we'd never have found Weenie...

28:34.004 --> 28:36.255
...and that giant tin-can thing.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.966
- Beginner's luck.
- Come on, Giselle.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.760
We gotta stick together out here.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.471
We're partners, right?

28:44.473 --> 28:49.811
Boog. You traitor.
And you, traitor-ette.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.979
Enjoy your newfound partnership.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.649
- Oh, come on, Elliot. Look...
- I don't need any of you.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.319
I'll find Mr. Weenie on my own.
Solo.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.030
Hey, you're going
the wrong way, you choob.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.409
Oh, thank you very much.
It's a shortcu...

29:09.498 --> 29:11.707
I'm okay, everybody.

29:12.376 --> 29:15.586
- You don't care.
- Not really.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.255
Was that too harsh?

29:25.514 --> 29:28.015
- We must follow the road, eh?
- You think?

29:32.020 --> 29:35.022
Come on.
Let's cut through the forest.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.025
Weenie, I am coming for you,
buddy.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.988
I am a wonderful tracker.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.949
I think Boog can fly
faster than you, huh?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.993
A million laughs.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.705
So are we having fun yet?

29:50.873 --> 29:54.542
Weenie is right around here,
and I am gonna...

29:55.002 --> 29:57.670
Wiener tracks! Yes, vindication!

29:57.838 --> 30:01.883
I've got your track, I've got your scent,
and here I come.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.676
That's a road, not a landing strip.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.011
Pull up.

30:05.179 --> 30:07.889
Hurry. Watch the ribs.

30:09.349 --> 30:13.060
Well, it's official.
Weenie is not up here.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.275
A whole herd of wieners.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.527
Oh, but these are Weenie's tracks
right here.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.362
He's an alpha wiener.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.991
Wonder why my jaw hurts.
Oh, well. More tracks.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.332
Oh, we're here.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.919
Hey, good to see you there, Bob.
There's a spot open on the right.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.424
Aren't you excited, Mr. Weenie?

30:43.592 --> 30:46.010
You get to see
all of your old friends again.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.386
And don't worry, snookums.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.680
Mama will make sure
that nothing bad happens...

30:49.848 --> 30:52.892
...to her little snuggly-wuggly
ever again.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.436
Bob, do you have
the Invisible Pet Fortress...

30:55.604 --> 30:57.563
...Electric Shock Collar?

30:57.731 --> 30:59.607
That's the one.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.235
Oh, that was nice. Thank you.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.700
What's the matter, Bob?
It's not working?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.329
Oh, good, it does work.

31:13.497 --> 31:17.500
Don't worry, Mr. Weenie,
it's more comfortable than it looks.

31:17.668 --> 31:21.629
Now, remember,
stay inside the Invisible Pet Fortress.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.965
Rufus, darling, is that Mr. Weenie?

31:24.132 --> 31:26.551
Well, butter my behind
and call me a biscuit.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.052
Let's go smell him.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.805
Now you'll be safe,
my little love muffin.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.348
Have fun with your friends.

31:32.516 --> 31:36.269
Mommy and Bob are gonna go have
some grown-up time with the adults.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.812
Hey, I found Weenie.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.565
- Oh, Mr. Weenie.
- Well, hey, short and long.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.024
- How you been?
- My friends.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.194
- It's Mr. Weenie.
- How you doing, Mr. Weenie?

31:45.487 --> 31:48.322
Deni. Look, there's Mr. Weenie.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.074
Weenie.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.661
We must return to base
for reinforcements, huh?

31:53.829 --> 31:54.829
Good plan.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.998
How you doing, Mr. Weenie?
Good to see you.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.708
Oh, I've missed you all so much.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.502
It's been so long
since I've had a proper greeting.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.796
- It's Weenie, all right.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.881
- Give me a hug.
- Stop.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.675
Don't crowd him.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.304
This dog has just been through
the unthinkable.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.848
- The what?
- Don't even think it.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.683
Why? You don't have to be rude.

32:15.851 --> 32:19.478
Poor Weenie. Poor, poor Weenie.

32:19.646 --> 32:21.606
Who knows
the horrors you've seen?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.190
- What horrors?
- Don't worry.

32:23.358 --> 32:26.694
- We will get through it together.
- Actually, it wasn't that bad.

32:26.862 --> 32:30.072
I know. It was worse.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.575
- I've been through it too.
- Really?

32:32.743 --> 32:33.868
Oh, Fifi.

32:34.036 --> 32:37.455
Will he ever be the old Mr. Weenie
we knew and loved?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.624
- We can only hope.
- But I am the same.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.417
We'll have to see
how much damage...

32:41.585 --> 32:43.628
...those insidious wilds
have done to him.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.715
"Insidious wilds"?
Nein, the wild animals are my friends.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.634
Friends?

32:49.801 --> 32:51.886
Your friends? Your friends?

32:52.054 --> 32:54.096
It is worse
than I could have ever imagined.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.558
Your friends? It's worse
than I could have ever imagined.

32:57.726 --> 33:00.561
He's gone... feral.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.356
- Feral?
- What's that mean?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.733
Fifi, what shall we do?

33:05.901 --> 33:07.526
You heard the lassie.
What do we do?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.528
- Can he be helped?
- Yes.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.406
But it won't be pretty.

33:12.574 --> 33:16.327
Prepare... the tent.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.829
- The tent?
- Not the tent.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.499
Oh, yes.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.709
The tent.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.797
I'm so tired.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.522
Hey, hey, hey, check it out.
They're back.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.856
Well, it's about time.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.358
Down below. Friends.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.111
- Our friends.
- We're low on fuel.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.612
Dive.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.907
Look, man, here they come.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.035
- Serge, are you okay?
- Did you find Mr. Weenie?

33:58.203 --> 33:59.787
- Relax. Deep breaths.
- Where is he?

33:59.955 --> 34:01.789
Come on, breathe for me.
In and out.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.624
What did you find?

34:06.336 --> 34:08.545
- Where's Weenie?
- What she says. Where's Weenie?

34:08.714 --> 34:11.132
- Where is he?
- What is he doing?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.551
How many syllables? Sounds like...

34:13.969 --> 34:15.594
I think I got it. He's in a tree.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.763
- He's in a tree house. A birdhouse.
- Woods.

34:17.931 --> 34:19.806
- His eggs are hatching.
- He has bird flu.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.684
- He's underwater.
- In a lagoon.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.978
- He works in a shrimp boat.
- He's in the ocean.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.980
- In a sub.
- He's wearing a wet suit.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.690
- This is it. At a zoo.
- In a cage.

34:27.858 --> 34:31.318
- He's joined a travelling circus.
- He was eaten by a lion in a cage.

34:31.485 --> 34:34.155
He's a clown. No, no, no.
It's a freak show.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.449
Hello? We found Mr. Weenie.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.161
Like Deni was saying...

34:40.328 --> 34:43.748
...Mr. Weenie is over the trees,
past the lake and the mountain...

34:43.915 --> 34:46.125
...at the campsite with some dogs.
And two cats.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.335
All right. Let's go.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.505
- Let's do this. Tell me something...
- No, stop!

34:54.009 --> 34:55.676
Oh, I'm peched.

34:59.681 --> 35:02.558
Past the mountains, huh?
Here's an idea.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.019
What do you say
we all rest for the night, huh?

35:05.187 --> 35:06.854
Brilliant.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.106
Come on, Weenie. Just do it.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.150
You know you want to.
It's inside you.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.693
Just do it, boy.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.613
- Do it for pets everywhere, Weenie.
- Never!

35:15.781 --> 35:18.324
- Just do it.
- Better do what the basset says.

35:18.492 --> 35:21.786
Hurry up, before Fifi gets here.
Too late.

35:22.704 --> 35:25.581
Is it done yet? Did he do it?
Is it over? Is it done?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.750
Did we do this? Is it over?
Are we finished?

35:27.918 --> 35:30.419
- Roberto.
- Fifi, it was great.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.671
You missed it. Too bad. Let's go.

35:33.757 --> 35:36.175
- The real answer, Rufus?
- We tried everything.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.219
Boy's locked up like a rusty gate.

35:38.637 --> 35:44.308
Oh, Weenie,
you can make this stop at any time.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.436
All you have to do is...

35:47.604 --> 35:49.104
...roll over.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.314
Roll over.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.567
- He keeps saying that.
- All right, then.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.904
We're going to have to
turn this up a notch.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.658
- I don't really see the point.
- Rufus, get the instruments.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.830
Here you are.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.040
Oh, no.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.502
Roberto, hand me the stick.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.379
Oh, boy.

36:13.880 --> 36:19.593
Listen carefully. Do as I say.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.011
Please, no.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.180
Fetch.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.599
- Go on, Weenie, fetch.
- Come on, Weenie.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.602
- Come on, Weenie. Now, come on.
- Get the stick. Go on, go on.

36:28.812 --> 36:29.895
Come on, Weenie.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.898
- You're almost there. You can do it.
- Go, Weenie, fetch.

36:33.066 --> 36:34.692
I'm a wild. I'm a wild animal.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.612
- And again with the nein.
- You are trying my patience.

36:38.780 --> 36:42.533
You are no longer a wild animal.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.286
You are a domestic pet...

36:45.453 --> 36:50.708
...and domestic pets
must obey their master.

36:50.876 --> 36:54.628
Now, hand me the squeaky toy.

36:54.796 --> 36:55.963
- No.
- Yes!

36:56.131 --> 36:58.674
- Okay, I hear you. Calm down. Relax.
- Yes, yes.

36:58.842 --> 36:59.967
Squeak, squeak.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.386
- It's a wild!
- He's so blue.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.638
Not the Sunday edition.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.724
Quick, Buddy, hop on.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.227
- He's getting away.
- Please, Fifi, no running.

37:10.770 --> 37:14.732
Buddy, get the electric collar off.
I'll stall them. Hurry!

37:15.901 --> 37:18.861
- Help us out, Charlene!
- Oh, I can't. I got my rollers in.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.989
- Weenie, you're so fast.
- Careful, Roger. You could...

37:22.157 --> 37:23.991
- Too late.
- Go, Weenie, go!

37:24.159 --> 37:27.328
Want another Shirley Temple there,
wild man?

37:27.495 --> 37:30.080
Oh, my, what's that?
Is that Mr. Weenie?

37:33.168 --> 37:34.668
Spread out.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.003
I'm gonna take five.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.838
Cut them off.

37:42.302 --> 37:45.512
- Buddy, hurry.
- I'm trying.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.187
Oh, no.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.732
- We did it.
- Now get this sweater off.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.734
It itches.

37:59.235 --> 38:02.321
- That's nasty.
- I have had it.

38:02.489 --> 38:06.325
No more. The wild animals
have pushed me too far!

38:06.493 --> 38:09.536
The next wild I see
crawl out of that forest...

38:09.704 --> 38:14.708
...if they don't have their papers,
they are getting a full Fifi smackdown!

38:14.876 --> 38:17.753
This is war!

38:18.338 --> 38:19.380
Oh, Fifi.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.382
I really don't have the stomach
for this.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.884
He smells like bad barbecue.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.887
Mr. Weenie, are you all right?

38:27.055 --> 38:29.556
Mr. Weenie, where are you?

38:29.724 --> 38:32.184
He's gone, Bob. Oh, no.

38:32.352 --> 38:36.188
We just found him,
and now he's gone again.

38:36.356 --> 38:39.400
Weenie. My poor Weenie.

38:39.567 --> 38:44.154
I wanna go home, Bob.
Please take me home.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.163
Now, I've heard some folks say...

38:53.331 --> 38:57.042
...the squirrel child
still roams these parts.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.212
And some nights,
when the moon is full...

39:00.380 --> 39:04.216
...and his monstrous buck teeth
ache to nibble...

39:04.384 --> 39:10.431
...you might, if you're unlucky,
hear his bloodcurdling cry!

39:13.977 --> 39:16.687
- Run!
- Let's move!

39:21.234 --> 39:24.486
Sorry. All that food.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.822
It's making me...

39:27.073 --> 39:29.283
- Making me hungry.
- Is he kidding?

39:29.451 --> 39:32.453
I'm so exhausted,
I couldn't eat a wee morsel.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.960
That hits the spot.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.635
Great. Even my roasting stick
is weak and pathetic.

39:48.803 --> 39:52.431
Hey. Don't that look
just like my man, Elli...?

39:52.974 --> 39:55.100
What was with Elliot
this morning anyway?

39:56.061 --> 39:59.605
Oh, hey. I wonder what's in here.

40:00.315 --> 40:02.149
Yes. Check this out.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.443
This is a little something
Beth taught me.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.826
These are called s'mores.

40:12.994 --> 40:15.329
Try some.
They take your mind off of everything.

40:15.497 --> 40:18.499
Clear your head. You ain't gonna
have nothing on your mind.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.793
I hope it works.

40:22.003 --> 40:24.463
You know what?
I'm glad Elliot's out of my life.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.716
Come on. I know you guys
exchanged some words back there...

40:27.884 --> 40:29.510
...but you're meant for each other.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.012
- He's crazy about you.
- Really?

40:32.180 --> 40:35.641
I bet Elliot's never once mentioned
that he loves me.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.726
Has he?

40:38.061 --> 40:41.355
Come on, we're guys.
We talk about guy stuff.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.024
You know, like sports.

40:44.192 --> 40:48.153
Rabbit bowling, rabbit tennis,
hockey with rabbits.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.405
- I'll take that as a no.
- All right.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.951
Take this marshmallow, for example.
It's great all by itself.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.538
It's soft, fluffy and sweet.
Like you, Giselle.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.790
Oh, Boog,
you're embarrassing yourself.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.209
Stay with me.
Now, check out this chocolate bar.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.418
It's awesome too.

41:03.586 --> 41:07.214
It's full of caffeine and sugar,
and it make you spazz out.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.423
Like Elliot.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.009
And even though on their own,
both are great...

41:11.177 --> 41:13.303
...neither are perfect, in my opinion.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.973
But they are perfect together.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.391
Come on. Give it a try.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.604
That's it. There you go.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.108
You're right, Boog.

41:26.276 --> 41:28.735
- This is really good.
- That's what I'm talking about.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.406
Unfortunately, some chocolate bars
feel that being in a s'more...

41:32.574 --> 41:35.075
...is too much commitment
and would rather run free...

41:35.243 --> 41:37.244
...instead of settling
for some marshmallow.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.038
- You're missing the point.
- Now that the wedding's off...

41:40.206 --> 41:44.585
...I bet Elliot's singing a new tune
and having the time of his life.

41:44.752 --> 41:48.881
Cold. So cold.

41:49.674 --> 41:53.760
I don't need anybody.
I can take care of myself.

42:19.037 --> 42:23.457
This... This is a good
character-building moment.

42:23.625 --> 42:28.629
Elliot, remember,
you are a wild creature toughing it out.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.506
I'll find Mr. Weenie all by myself.

42:31.674 --> 42:35.969
I don't need anybody.
And I definitely don't need a girlfriend.

42:36.137 --> 42:40.682
So what if she tucks me in at night,
or listens to my problems?

42:40.850 --> 42:42.684
Makes really good
pine-cone crunchies...

42:42.852 --> 42:45.646
...or rubs my head
when I have sickies?

42:45.813 --> 42:48.732
Criminy, what have I done?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.654
Giselle!

42:57.533 --> 42:59.993
Breaker, breaker.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.620
Ten-four.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.121
Roberto, come on now.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.124
Hurry up.
Time to go to Pet Paradiso.

43:06.292 --> 43:09.920
Did you hear that, Fif?
I'm so excited.

43:10.088 --> 43:13.006
I'm looking forward
to the water slides and the buffet...

43:13.174 --> 43:16.426
...and the pool and the babes.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.803
How about you, Fifi?

43:20.098 --> 43:24.268
- Easy does it. Keep that ice pack on.
- Shut up!

43:24.435 --> 43:26.103
Good advice, bud.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.111
Here.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.197
- Here.
- What Deni's trying to say is...

43:37.365 --> 43:39.324
...this is where the Weenie was.

43:39.909 --> 43:42.536
- Gone.
- Oh, that's just great.

43:42.704 --> 43:45.706
- Well, let's check it out.
- I'm on it.

43:48.334 --> 43:51.878
What have we here?
Aye, Mr. Weenie was definitely here.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.131
Come on, Squiz.
What else you got for me?

43:55.300 --> 43:57.843
And over here,
a titanic battle ensued.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.803
A battle? Are you serious?

43:59.971 --> 44:02.889
- Is he for real?
- Wait, wait, look.

44:03.057 --> 44:07.686
And here,
the unspeakable happened.

44:07.854 --> 44:09.354
- What?
- What's the unspeakable?

44:09.522 --> 44:12.232
It's unspeakable because
the tracks end here. I got bupkis.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.736
- Oh, brother, you got to be ki...
- Where do you think they went?

44:15.903 --> 44:19.489
How would I know?
I'm a tracker, not a bleeding psychic.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.951
- What do you think, Boog?
- I don't know.

44:23.119 --> 44:26.913
If only we had some kind of a sign.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.083
- Come on, everyone.
- Oh, I hope this is the right way.

44:31.461 --> 44:33.754
Stay sharp
and keep your eyes peeled.

44:36.549 --> 44:40.093
Fifi, would you take a gander
at this?

44:40.261 --> 44:45.057
This, my half-pint friend,
puts the P in "paradise".

44:45.224 --> 44:46.933
Oh, Roberto.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.770
- I can't... I can't do this.
- Come on, Fifi.

44:49.937 --> 44:53.440
I think a bald spot
makes you look more sophisticated.

44:53.608 --> 44:56.401
- Singe is the new pompadour.
- Oh, shut up!

44:56.569 --> 44:57.611
Sure thing.

45:02.742 --> 45:07.329
We gave him everything
he could've ever wanted, right, Bob?

45:07.955 --> 45:11.792
I don't know if we should
go on living without him, Bob.

45:11.959 --> 45:12.959
No, no, no.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.962
He would want us to go on
living our lives, wouldn't he, Bob?

45:16.130 --> 45:17.756
Road hog!

45:19.884 --> 45:22.219
I knew you'd agree.

45:23.012 --> 45:24.388
I'm free, I'm free

45:24.555 --> 45:25.764
Sing it with me, Buddy.

45:25.932 --> 45:27.974
Free at last, free at last

45:28.643 --> 45:31.311
What monstrosity is that?

45:31.771 --> 45:32.813
Scary.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.275
Elliot?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.319
Where are the others?

45:39.487 --> 45:42.572
Oh, they're rescuing
Mr. Weenie and Buddy.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.157
- Hey, Buddy.
- Hi there.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.409
- But Weenie...
- And Buddy.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.618
- Are free like you.

45:46.786 --> 45:49.287
Oh, yeah. I'm free.

45:49.455 --> 45:52.332
Free to be alone
for the rest of my life.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.667
You don't understand.

45:53.835 --> 45:56.253
Our friends are heading
to Pet Paradiso.

45:57.630 --> 45:58.922
Have them get me a T-shirt.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.676
The pets, they hate the wilds.

46:02.844 --> 46:07.013
They're in serious danger.
Wake up, mein Freund.

46:07.348 --> 46:09.182
Weenie. When did you get here?

46:09.350 --> 46:12.602
Don't you see?
Boog, McSquizzy, Giselle.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.480
- They'll all be torn to pieces.
- Torn to pizzas?

46:15.648 --> 46:17.441
- Pieces, you Strudelkopf.
- Pieces.

46:17.608 --> 46:19.860
- Giselle's in trouble?
- Yeah, Giselle!

46:20.027 --> 46:23.196
Well, why didn't you say so?
Giselle, my love!

46:23.364 --> 46:27.451
- I'm coming to save you!
- You're going the wrong way.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.578
No, I'm not...!

46:30.204 --> 46:32.122
Goodbye.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.544
Look at all those RVs.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.045
Weenie must be here.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.506
So how are we gonna get inside?

46:41.674 --> 46:44.759
I'm a grizzly. No biggie.
We'll just walk in.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.845
Look, just like that little guy.

46:47.013 --> 46:49.556
Wild animal breach.

46:52.059 --> 46:55.145
Okay. Who's got
the next brilliant idea?

46:55.313 --> 46:57.272
Aye, it's easy.
We could tunnel our way in.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.357
Or we could fly you all in.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.692
Oh, there's a great idea.

47:00.860 --> 47:05.071
A 1-pound bag of crazy
lifting a 1200-pound bag of lazy.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.492
- What? I'm 900 pounds.
- That's crap.

47:08.659 --> 47:11.578
- Oh, you think you so tough?
- Come on, is that your best shot?

47:11.746 --> 47:12.954
- What do you got?
- Stop it.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.331
- Stop it!
- Shove off.

47:14.499 --> 47:15.916
Grow up, you two.

47:16.083 --> 47:18.752
Now, come on. Let's stay on track.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.339
It looks safe enough.

47:23.299 --> 47:24.758
Follow me.

47:34.435 --> 47:36.269
What's wrong?

47:36.729 --> 47:39.231
Come on, spit it out.

47:39.398 --> 47:42.150
Oh, you're so beautiful.

47:42.318 --> 47:43.568
- Just like Mama.
- Okay.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.487
I see a woman and her dog.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.739
Yeah. Look again.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.037
- Oh, I'm gonna have nightmares!
- Quiet.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.414
Come along, Jezzabelle. Heel.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.626
Hey, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

47:59.794 --> 48:01.127
Definitely.

48:01.796 --> 48:04.631
There we go. Perfecto.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.384
This is not at all what I was thinking.

48:07.552 --> 48:09.386
- This'll never work.
- Yeah.

48:09.554 --> 48:12.472
Sure it will. We look great.

48:13.808 --> 48:16.977
What? I could sell this.

48:19.981 --> 48:21.773
Is he serious?

48:24.443 --> 48:27.153
Boog, the idea
is to blend in with the pets.

48:27.321 --> 48:29.114
She's right. You look ridiculous.

48:29.282 --> 48:30.657
All right, fine.

48:30.825 --> 48:34.619
- But if things get all crazy...
- We'll come get you. I promise.

48:36.372 --> 48:39.374
Do I really have to wear a bow?
I look like a jessie.

48:39.542 --> 48:42.752
You're supposed to be a little dog,
and all little dogs wear bows.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.672
What are you two looking at?
Keep an eye on them.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.507
Deni, follow me.

48:47.675 --> 48:52.053
Okay.
All the time, "Deni, do this, do that".

48:53.931 --> 48:55.307
Interesting.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.309
Oh, poor Fifi.

48:57.476 --> 49:02.355
Here. A little zinc will help
protect that tender pink skin.

49:02.523 --> 49:04.065
Have fun now.

49:04.233 --> 49:05.567
It's not bad.

49:05.735 --> 49:08.236
No one will even notice.

49:09.655 --> 49:15.452
No one will notice?

49:15.620 --> 49:18.496
- No one will notice?
- Okay.

49:18.664 --> 49:20.707
- He noticed. He noticed.
- Okay.

49:20.875 --> 49:22.000
- I noticed.
- Take it...

49:22.168 --> 49:23.376
- You noticed.
- I heard you.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.253
- We all noticed. I noticed!
- I got it.

49:25.421 --> 49:26.463
Forget about it.

49:26.631 --> 49:27.714
Me and my big mouth.

49:27.882 --> 49:31.551
- One king and two doggy beds.
- And can I have synthetic pillows?

49:33.054 --> 49:35.472
This is so weird.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.064
Classic flattop. One of my favourites.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.024
Of all the stupid...

49:46.192 --> 49:48.568
- Quiet.
- Fresh cut. Come and get it.

49:48.736 --> 49:50.737
This is the strangest place
I've ever seen.

49:50.905 --> 49:53.573
Let's find Weenie
and get out of here.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.950
Just ignore them.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.078
Keep walking. No eye contact.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.955
What you looking at,
you wee bug-eyed freak?

50:01.123 --> 50:02.248
McSquizzy.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.209
What did I just say?

50:04.585 --> 50:06.586
- Get down, everyone.
- Go get it, boy. Fetch.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.755
Fetch. Fetch it, buddy.

50:08.923 --> 50:10.757
- Mine, mine, mine.
- One more.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.426
This place is giving me
the skeevies.

50:13.678 --> 50:16.096
Giselle!

50:18.933 --> 50:20.850
- My spine.
- We're here.

50:22.937 --> 50:25.814
This looks nothing like the brochure,
right, Weenie?

50:25.981 --> 50:27.607
Pets and their owners.

50:28.859 --> 50:32.070
They look so happy together.

50:32.238 --> 50:35.448
Oh, I don't know if I can go in there
without my mama.

50:35.616 --> 50:37.283
Oh, forget Mama.

50:37.451 --> 50:39.953
Giselle. We have to get in there
for Giselle.

50:40.121 --> 50:42.455
- And the others.
- It's too much. I can't.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.458
Repeat after me: I'm wild.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.168
I'm wild.

50:47.336 --> 50:48.586
With conviction.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.088
I'm wild!

50:50.256 --> 50:52.382
- What was that for?
- That was payback.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.092
Fair enough.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.593
What was that for?

50:55.761 --> 50:58.221
That one was just for fun.
Now' let's do this!

50:58.389 --> 51:00.140
Might be a little cold.

51:01.684 --> 51:04.018
That looks painful.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.604
- Too hard?
- Poor guy, they stretched him out.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.940
Another round, Mr. Bailey?

51:09.108 --> 51:11.109
Another round, Mr. Whiskers?

51:13.821 --> 51:15.238
Hey there, pretty lady.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.532
Who's he calling a lady?

51:17.700 --> 51:20.076
- Hey.
- Hello, baby.

51:20.244 --> 51:22.412
Beat it, Doberman pinhead.
She's taken.

51:22.788 --> 51:24.664
Good looks and funny too.

51:24.832 --> 51:29.002
But I was not talking to the Dalmatian,
little Miss Sugar-Snack.

51:29.170 --> 51:32.088
- Idiot. I'm not a girl!
- Hurry along. Let's not be rude.

51:32.256 --> 51:33.715
Hey, chica.

51:33.883 --> 51:36.885
You take care
of that body for Rico, huh?

51:37.428 --> 51:38.511
"Take care of that body"?

51:38.679 --> 51:42.807
I'll give you "Take care of that body",
you big musclebound bag of...

51:42.975 --> 51:45.602
- There, there. I see them.
- Look, I spotted them.

51:45.770 --> 51:47.312
- I still got it, eh?
- Genius.

51:47.646 --> 51:50.482
- Mr. Weenie.
- Show yourself, laddie.

51:50.649 --> 51:51.691
Mr. Weenie?

51:51.859 --> 51:53.318
Weenie?

51:55.154 --> 51:58.406
Roger, something's not right.
Do you smell something fishy here?

51:58.574 --> 52:00.992
Barracuda.

52:01.869 --> 52:04.829
Weenie.
Where are you, you wee pup...?

52:05.206 --> 52:06.790
Oh, goodness me.

52:06.957 --> 52:10.084
I think we have some dogs
of a different breed.

52:10.252 --> 52:13.004
The girl with the bow, she's mine.

52:13.714 --> 52:16.966
- We have to go.
- Yes, we're late. Very late.

52:17.551 --> 52:20.637
- Stanley, it's the fishies.
- Not now, Roger.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.472
Oh, no.

52:22.890 --> 52:28.186
My friends, today justice
wears a blue barrette...

52:28.354 --> 52:32.023
...and a rhinestone collar.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.318
Excuse me,
you got a wee something right there.

52:35.486 --> 52:38.696
Quiet! Squirrel! Varmint!

52:38.864 --> 52:41.741
- Quiet! Quiet!
- Come on, take it down a notch.

52:41.909 --> 52:44.410
- Shut up!
- Deni, this does not look good.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.412
- Let's go get Boog.
- Bad. Very bad.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.752
- Quiet.
- Okay.

52:53.087 --> 52:56.256
Elliot, Weenie.
Thank goodness you're safe.

52:57.258 --> 52:59.092
- What are you doing?
- Who are you?

52:59.260 --> 53:01.219
What do you mean?
I'm your best friend.

53:01.387 --> 53:03.054
- McSquizzy?
- McSquizzy?

53:03.222 --> 53:04.430
He doesn't even like you.

53:04.598 --> 53:07.934
Look, I'm not talking to some
random overweight sheepdog...

53:08.102 --> 53:10.603
...about my personal relationships.
- It's me, Boog.

53:10.771 --> 53:13.731
- Boog's fatter. No way.
- Elliot.

53:14.316 --> 53:15.775
It is you. Did you lose weight?

53:15.943 --> 53:19.362
When did you start thinking
McSquizzy was your BFF?

53:20.489 --> 53:22.699
Well, you were hibernating,
and we were hanging.

53:22.867 --> 53:25.952
Turns out we have a lot in common.
We both like nuts.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.996
- You are nuts.
- Stop this insanity!

53:28.163 --> 53:30.832
- Where are the others?
- They're inside looking for you.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.459
- And they've been captured!
- Captured?

53:35.588 --> 53:36.629
Oh, come on.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.548
Boog. I'm Boog.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.300
No, Boog is a big fat guy.

53:40.467 --> 53:41.801
- That's not you.
- I know.

53:41.969 --> 53:45.305
- I thought that he was McSquizzy too.
- Okay, stop. Would you all stop?

53:45.472 --> 53:48.016
- What do you mean, captured?
- They've been captured...

53:48.183 --> 53:50.727
...by a gaggle of vicious domestics.

53:50.895 --> 53:53.313
- Enough talk.
- Hang on there' E.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.565
You don't wanna go stomping on
up in there.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.984
- You're right. What we need is a...
- Don't say it.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.861
Don't say it.

54:00.988 --> 54:03.489
- Plan!

54:04.575 --> 54:06.451
- This is not gonna work.
- It'll work.

54:06.619 --> 54:08.202
Don't doubt me, number two friend.

54:08.370 --> 54:11.664
- Trust the plan.
- Trust the plan.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.251
- Well, that was easy.
- See?

54:15.419 --> 54:17.378
- I told you it would work.
- Hey!

54:17.546 --> 54:19.505
- Just a minute!
- The plan's not gonna work.

54:19.673 --> 54:22.216
- The plan's not gonna work.
- Be cool. Hold it together.

54:22.384 --> 54:26.179
Do you think you can just
waltz right in here...

54:26.347 --> 54:29.807
...without your room key,
Mrs. Schlapiano?

54:29.975 --> 54:31.184
You must've dropped this.

54:34.355 --> 54:36.856
A voice like an angel.

54:37.024 --> 54:41.152
- I wonder where I left my room key.
- Wait a second!

54:41.320 --> 54:42.862
Nice try.

54:43.030 --> 54:46.032
You're not fooling anyone
with that phoney disguise.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.743
What are you wearing,
a porcupine on your head?

54:48.911 --> 54:50.995
Get out of here, you vagrant.

54:51.163 --> 54:53.122
- We made it.
- Yeah, that worked well.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.876
Well, yes, because we had a plan.

54:57.044 --> 54:59.879
Giselle. Giselle, where are you?

55:01.674 --> 55:03.216
Go.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.096
Help! Help!

55:08.263 --> 55:10.598
Help! Somebody, help us!

55:10.766 --> 55:14.686
Scream all you like.
The humans can't hear you from here.

55:14.853 --> 55:16.729
And the house pets...

55:16.897 --> 55:22.068
...well, they hate wilds
just as much as I do!

55:22.236 --> 55:24.278
When I get free,
you're gonna pay for this...

55:24.446 --> 55:27.824
...you big tube, you numpty,
you big lassie's blouse.

55:27.992 --> 55:30.410
Watch your language, varmint.
There's a lady present.

55:30.577 --> 55:32.578
What a vile little creature.

55:32.746 --> 55:39.002
My friends, it is time
to tame these savage beasts.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.089
You gotta be kidding me, right?

55:43.590 --> 55:46.926
Hey, Fif. Are you sure we can't
let the little girl squirrel go?

55:47.094 --> 55:49.429
Yeah. Let the little girl squirrel go.

55:49.596 --> 55:51.764
Not a chance.

55:51.932 --> 55:54.100
Roberto, you know what to do.

55:54.268 --> 55:56.978
- Wha...? I don't know what you mean.
- Collar them, you fool.

55:57.146 --> 55:59.605
- Collar them, collar them, collar them.
- I hear you.

55:59.773 --> 56:01.399
- Okay.
- Collar them, collar them...

56:01.567 --> 56:03.526
...you fool.
- Calm down. Okay.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.446
- The pool, so tempting.
- Forget the pool.

56:06.613 --> 56:08.531
- Elliot's right.
- Remember the objective.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.242
- Oh, sweet libations.
- Control yourself.

56:11.410 --> 56:13.619
- The buffet. Wiener schnitzel?
- No. Forget food.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.121
- Strudel.
- He's not listening.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.957
- Mama's favourite.
- Oh, nuts.

56:19.126 --> 56:20.543
Boog, grab him.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.253
- Weenie.
- Come on. Come back here.

56:22.421 --> 56:24.338
- Way to go, Boog.
- You go on ahead.

56:24.506 --> 56:25.715
I'll catch up.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.801
Leave us alone. Help!

56:29.470 --> 56:30.553
- Try this.
- Thanks.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.472
- Help!
- Giselle.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.932
You fuzz ball,
you'll never get away with this.

56:35.100 --> 56:38.478
Oh, but I already have.

56:38.645 --> 56:42.648
Oh, but you already haven't.

56:43.150 --> 56:45.902
- What are you doing?
- It's Mrs. Schlapiano.

56:46.070 --> 56:49.781
Get lost, old lady.
This does not concern you.

56:49.948 --> 56:51.282
I am no old lady.

56:51.784 --> 56:55.328
- It is the porcupine in disguise.
- Yeah.

56:56.163 --> 56:59.832
- I didn't see him up there. Did you?
- It's me, Elliot.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.834
- Who is Elliot?
- I am.

57:02.002 --> 57:05.838
And I'm here to rescue my lady,
kick butt and take names.

57:06.006 --> 57:08.299
What's your name?

57:10.344 --> 57:12.845
- Did anybody see that coming?
- Yes.

57:13.013 --> 57:16.182
- Even Roger saw that coming.
- I did?

57:16.350 --> 57:19.519
Come on, Weenie.
Snap out of it, man.

57:20.896 --> 57:22.230
Das ist beautiful.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.857
Weenie, would you
come back here?

57:25.359 --> 57:26.442
Oh, man.

57:26.610 --> 57:30.446
Now how you gonna hide
a 900-pound bear?

57:30.614 --> 57:32.740
A 1200-pound wild bear!

57:32.908 --> 57:34.659
What, 1200 pounds?

57:34.827 --> 57:37.620
Girl, you know that ain't right.
I'm 900 pounds.

57:40.290 --> 57:41.707
This is mostly fur...

57:41.875 --> 57:43.793
...and fur adds
a hundred pounds easy.

57:44.670 --> 57:45.711
Go, go, go!

57:45.879 --> 57:49.048
I'll be bulking up to hibernate.
Just wait till I step out that...

57:50.425 --> 57:51.551
- Bear!
- Bear!

57:51.718 --> 57:53.010
We have a security breach.

57:53.178 --> 57:55.346
Perimeter has been compromised.

57:55.514 --> 57:58.307
Telling you, I'm gonna be
the baddest bear ever in the woods.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.810
- We have a grizzly on the loose.
- Then we'll see...

58:00.978 --> 58:03.563
...who's ready for swimming season.
- Darts loaded.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.064
Fire!

58:07.192 --> 58:10.319
Hey, man, be cool. Back off.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.529
Go.

58:11.697 --> 58:13.239
Little dude, go.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.032
You come back here right now.

58:16.160 --> 58:17.910
Go.

58:22.958 --> 58:24.041
This is crazy.

58:27.796 --> 58:30.590
Weenie!

58:35.179 --> 58:37.805
Fifi, come on.
Is this really necessary?

58:37.973 --> 58:39.807
You see why
we have to do this, right?

58:39.975 --> 58:42.101
They will take everything.

58:42.269 --> 58:45.438
Our food, our homes, our very lives!

58:45.606 --> 58:49.192
Wait. If this is the end,
I need to say something.

58:49.359 --> 58:53.613
- Giselle, I really, really, really...
- Really?

58:53.780 --> 58:56.324
- Time's up.
- Now, you hold your little old horses.

58:56.491 --> 58:59.285
I do believe this boy's
got something on his mind.

58:59.453 --> 59:03.080
- Yeah, give the guy a sporting chance.
- Oh, just forget it, Elliot.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.124
You've already made it clear
how you feel.

59:05.292 --> 59:08.753
I feel that this
has gone on long enough.

59:08.921 --> 59:10.588
- Please let me finish.
- Fine.

59:10.756 --> 59:13.299
You've got 60 seconds.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.468
Are you serious?
How about a minute?

59:15.636 --> 59:18.304
- Hey, you better hurry up.
- Okay, okay.

59:18.472 --> 59:21.933
Giselle, before the wedding,
my rack was huge.

59:22.100 --> 59:23.184
- What?
- It's true.

59:23.352 --> 59:26.729
Very huge. And it broke very bad.

59:26.897 --> 59:30.316
And without my huge rack,
I felt like less of a buck.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.860
- But as time went on...
- Thirty seconds.

59:33.028 --> 59:37.907
The point is, I'm a better buck
with not a huge rack on my head...

59:38.075 --> 59:41.410
...but with you, Giselle,
on my head instead.

59:41.578 --> 59:42.870
Oh, that's awful.

59:43.038 --> 59:44.997
And how does this relate
to our wedding...

59:45.165 --> 59:47.458
...and the fact that you left me
at the altar?

59:47.626 --> 59:50.336
- Left you at the altar?
- You, sir, are a coward.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.799
Oh, no.

59:55.259 --> 59:58.010
- No, no. You are missing the point.
- Oh, come on.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:01.347
During our wedding, there was
the incident with the other woman.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:02.640
Another woman?

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.725
I can't even handle one.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.519
Speak for yourself, amigo.

01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:08.688
No. No.
Not that kind of other woman.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.356
The kind that grabbed Mr. Weenie.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.191
- You're disgusting.
- That is a pig.

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.402
- You make me sick.
- This is getting good.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.864
- Isn't it refreshing?
- Come here, you.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.452
Fifteen seconds.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.998
Will you, please?
Giselle, you are good.

01:00:27.165 --> 01:00:28.541
And me? Not always good.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.127
But with you, the me
that is not good can be better.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:33.713
You make my not-good me
almost not bad.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.007
And that's not almost good,
it's almost great.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.843
So, Giselle, you and me,
not badder, but greater.

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.052
Understand?

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.555
- Tick, tick, tick!
- What is he talking about?

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:44.807
Forget it.
Just push the button already.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.559
- Finally.
- No. Don't.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.145
Cannonball!

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:50.354
Gotcha.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:52.189
I love you, Boog.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:55.735
Goodness me.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:01.615
Hold on, now.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.076
There it is.

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:06.412
- That was close.
- Is everybody okay?

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.747
You're still in danger.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.415
The Fifi will kill you all.

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.042
Get the collars off.

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:15.087
Fifi, where are you going?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.756
Mr. Weenie?

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.258
Let's get you out of those ropes.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.510
- Boog, look out.
- Take cover.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:26.265
Elliot, you take care of these guys.
I'll draw the others away.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.434
- We gotta get these off.
- Thank you.

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:30.895
I won't let you hurt my friends.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.605
Hey.

01:01:33.774 --> 01:01:35.399
Weenie's in trouble. I gotta go.

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:37.443
- Weenie, I'm coming.
- Elliot, careful.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:42.198
Breaker, breaker.
Mudflaps, do you read me? Over.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:44.492
This is Mudflaps. Over.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.077
You're not gonna believe it.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.746
Mr. Weenie just
ran by me poolside.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.457
- Over.
- Bob, they found Mr. Weenie.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:52.792
Hurry. Get in.

01:01:55.796 --> 01:01:57.254
Hey, where's the fire, huh?

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.927
Oh, boy. There it is.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:06.097
Mr. Weenie, Mama's coming, baby.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:08.766
Mama's coming.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.563
Hey, Chet, lock up, would you?

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.607
I'm calling it a day, huh?

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:22.113
Finally, some alone time.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.492
Look out there, doggy.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.327
Weenie. Weenie.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.747
- Are you all right?
- Weenie's fine. Get the remote.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.082
- I got it.
- Take this!

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:36.961
Oh, no, you don't.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:46.846
Oh, my.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.683
Save Rico, chica. Save Rico.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:52.017
There's so many.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.312
Lock and load.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.647
Pull!

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.486
Stanley, duck.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.864
Man down. I'm hit.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:08.492
See? One duck, two duck.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.035
We did it.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.205
- Come on, Rico.
- Rico got your back, baby.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.124
Take that.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:17.668
Fire!

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.049
Saved by the slobber.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:27.136
- Get him off me! Get him off!
- Take this, you wild beast!

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.305
Oh, no.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.224
- That's Elliot.
- That ain't good. Let's go.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:39.273
- Elliot?
- Oh, no.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.900
- Rico, where is he?
- Oh, man.

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.777
- He's gotta get those collars off.
- Stop.

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.571
Or everyone gets it.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:48.491
Do you understand?

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.663
- Elliot. You okay?
- Yes, yes.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.917
- You could've gotten here sooner.
- You're breathing, aren't you?

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:02.546
Let this be an example to you all.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.089
- No, don't.
- No, Fifi, no.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.091
- Don't do it.
- Fifi, stop. Seriously.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.594
- Don't do it, Fifi.
- Don't push the button.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:10.888
Hold on, pal.

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.016
This is it.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.896
Oh, no.

01:04:20.732 --> 01:04:22.942
What? How did you do that?

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:24.944
The old switcheroo, Boog.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:30.824
That was not fair.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:33.577
I gotta be honest with you.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:35.287
He kind of had that coming.

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:38.332
Ice cream.

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:40.960
Hang in there, Hoppy.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:44.463
But, officers, Fox Jaws
said Mr. Weenie was here.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.215
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:49.552
Why don't you run through
that description for me one more time.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.971
Yeah, Dispatch,
we got a male Caucasian...

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:55.057
...early 30s,
sustaining multiple pheno injections.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.726
- We're sending him over to County.
- Go...

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.937
You heard him. Go.

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:02.356
He's also dark brown
and long and jiggly...

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:04.650
...and he walks
with the cutest little waddle.

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:08.612
Does this match the description
of your dog, ma'am?

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.824
Oh, Mr. Weenie.

01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:14.952
I miss you so much.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.413
Hey, Roberto, my main man.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.999
- I appreciate the help out there.
- Sure thing.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:22.334
And if you're ever
in the city, come on by.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:24.920
We'll split a pizza pie. My treat.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:31.343
From this day forward, domestics
and wilds will live together as one.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.054
So your doghouse or mine, chica?

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:38.350
Hey, Rico, come here.
Let me share a wee secret with you.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.311
I'm not a girl!

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:45.024
What? SeÃ±or, you have played
with Rico's emotions.

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:48.319
Come on, Elliot.
Time to head on home.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.697
- I hear you. Come on, Giselle.
- All right, everybody. Take it easy.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.408
Well' it's time to swap spit
and hit the road.

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:56.452
You said it, cowboy.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.370
- Hold on. Wait for me.
- Bye-bye.

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.872
Hey, wait, Mr. Weenie.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.540
Aren't you coming?

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.419
Well, I have decided
not to go with you.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.963
- Why not?
- Because just like you...

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:11.800
...I have realised that if you're never
tied to anything, you'll never be free.

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.511
- We're not tied together anymore.
- This is figurative.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.388
So we have to be tied up in order...?

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:18.807
No. We must have limits
to be limitless.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.478
Find a seat. This could take a while.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.189
All that matters
is to be with the one you love...

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.232
...und the one that loves you.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.234
You're not making
any sense, Weenie.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.905
I'm just gonna spend the rest of my life
with the one who loves me:

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:34.740
Giselle.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.409
Wait for me.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.619
Goodbye, my friends.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:40.579
I will miss you all!

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:44.249
Weenie. It's been ages.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.001
- Here's my chance.
- Roger.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.753
Let's go find your buddy Stanley.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.756
No, no, no. He's your friend now.

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.426
- It's so sad, isn't it, Bob?
- Okay, okay.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:57.096
Calm down. Calm down.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.390
Look. There he is. Long and jiggly.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:02.434
Mr. Weenie? Is that you?

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.771
Mr. Weenie.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:12.861
Mr. Weenie!

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:15.948
Oh, my baby.

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:19.284
You came back to Mama.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:20.703
Don't lose him again, now.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:23.163
- That dog loves you.
- Never.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.792
Oh, no. The woman-beast
is torturing him again.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.961
What? Is that what you call torture?

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.967
Yeah. Why do you ask?

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:37.344
Why? Man,
she's showing him affection.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:40.639
You know, kiss, kiss, hug, hug.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.642
I might have misread that.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.269
You might have misread that?

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:47.896
- Let me at him!
- Hey, hey. Come on now.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.982
- Come on.
- Don't let go of him, Boog.

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:53.986
- Take it easy.
- Well, enough of that hullabaloo.

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:57.322
You know what, Giselle?
Mr. Weenie was right.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:58.824
About what?

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:02.995
About, you know, all that stuff
about what really matters.

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.372
Stuff? Oh, Elliot.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.293
How do I know you really feel it
if you can't even say it?

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:11.837
- Well, do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:15.132
- Okay. You, me, together for...
- Hello.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.341
You were saying?

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.553
It's me and you for...

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.848
- Go on.
- Okay, what I'm trying to say is...

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:25.225
Why do these birds and ducks
suddenly appear...

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.728
...every time you're near?

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.564
Unless, like me...

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:34.026
...they long to be close to you.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:37.154
Oh, Elliot,
that's the most romantic thing...

01:08:37.322 --> 01:08:42.493
Why do stars fall down from the sky

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:47.790
Every time you walk by?

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.042
Just like me

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:52.544
They long to be

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:56.506
Close to you

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:01.511
On the day that you were born
The angels got together

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:05.974
And decided to create
A dream come true

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.102
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:14.733
And starlight in your eyes of blue

01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:20.279
That is why
All the girls in town

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:21.573
Follow me...

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.908
- Oh, dear.
... all around.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.160
It's true.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.662
Just like me

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.915
They long to be

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.584
Close to you

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.089
Just like me

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.676
They long to be

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:45.264
Close to you

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.015
Giselle, I love you.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.225
You said it!

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:51.937
I love you, Elliot.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.023
Yeah, that's my man.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:10:07.744
Close to you

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.246
Not too close.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.753
Close to you

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.630
I love this song.

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:25.387
Close to you

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:28.307
Oh, Roberto, that's beautiful.

01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:35.480
Close to you

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.482
Sing it, Bob.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.658
Big finish now.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.665
Elliot?

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:01.840
Close to you

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:04.468
That just ain't right.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.595
Come on!
