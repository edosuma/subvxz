09:37.660 --> 09:40.830
THE NICE CLUMPED UP SILK,
A REALLY SHINY RIBBON,

09:40.913 --> 09:42.039
AND A NICE LITTLE GEM
IN THERE.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.624
- THE WAY YOU CAPTURED
THAT SATINY, SHINY FEEL,

09:43.708 --> 09:46.502
THAT'S WHAT REALLY
KICKS THIS THING OFF, MAN.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.462
I THINK YOU DID
A GREAT JOB.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.547
- CHRIS.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.133
- OVERALL, MAN, IT'S A NICE FLOW
FOR THE LEG.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.634
THE BOW ON THE BACK
IS A GOOD THING

09:53.718 --> 09:56.470
TO BREAK UP THE MONOTONY
OF THAT BAND APPEARANCE.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.889
MAYBE IF YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT TEXTURE

09:58.973 --> 10:00.349
BEHIND WHERE YOU HAVE THE GRAY,
JUST SO THAT IT SHOWS

10:00.433 --> 10:03.853
THE CONNECTION TO THE BAND.
- JOEY.

10:03.936 --> 10:04.854
- I LIKE HOW DARK IT IS.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.356
I JUST WISH THERE WAS
A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE

10:07.440 --> 10:09.191
BETWEEN THE BAND
AND THE SHEER.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.945
THERE'S VERY LITTLE
TONAL DIFFERENCES THERE.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.989
KYLE, THE CHALLENGE
WAS TEXTURE,

10:15.072 --> 10:16.615
AND THIS DESIGN YOU HAVE,
IT LOOKS LIKE

10:16.699 --> 10:17.366
I COULD RUB MY HAND
ACROSS IT.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.576
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A BRAILLE.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.370
- YOU PULLED OFF
A PRETTY SNAZZY TRICK.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.872
- THANK YOU.
- JASON.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.665
- I LIKE THE ATTENTION
YOU PAID TO DETAIL

10:24.749 --> 10:25.875
IN THE TEXTURE OF THE NETTING.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.501
YOU TOOK YOUR TIME,
AND IT PAID OFF.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.086
- CRAIG.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.379
- DID YOU RUN THAT
STRAIGHT LINE IN THE BACK

10:30.463 --> 10:33.174
BECAUSE YOU RAN OUT OF TIME?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.592
- NO, I TRIED TO ESTIMATE
HOW MUCH TATTOO

10:34.675 --> 10:37.178
THAT I COULD ACTUALLY DO AND
GET AWAY WITH THAT MUCH SIZE.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.221
- I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT
DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY AROUND.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.890
THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL
YOU PUT IN THERE

10:40.973 --> 10:41.724
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.685
- I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
- RICH.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.188
- AS FAR AS THE TEXTURE
OF THE TATTOO,

10:47.271 --> 10:49.440
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE
MORE OF THE ACTUAL FOLDS,

10:49.523 --> 10:50.441
REALLY PULL THAT OFF.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.568
BY SEPARATING THE DARK
FROM THE LIGHT,

10:52.651 --> 10:54.445
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN MORE
OF THE OVER AND UNDER

10:54.528 --> 10:56.322
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING
TO ACHIEVE.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.741
E.S., WHAT HAPPENED?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.117
- I GUESS I WORK
A LITTLE SLOWER.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.077
OPERATING UNDER THE GUN,

11:01.160 --> 11:02.787
THAT'S THE BIG THING
IN THIS COMPETITION.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.039
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO NOT LET
THAT TIME BRING YOU DOWN.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.375
- ALLY.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.502
- I REALLY LIKE THE ADDITION
OF THE FEATHER.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.754
I THINK THE COLOR BLENDINGS
AREN'T AS SOFT AND SMOOTH

11:11.837 --> 11:13.756
AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN,
WHICH GIVES THIS TATTOO

11:13.839 --> 11:14.131
A LITTLE BIT
OF A ROUGH FEEL.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.675
- JIME.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.762
- THE AMOUNT OF DARK YOU HAVE
IN THE TOP BAND,

11:19.845 --> 11:21.430
BUT THEN THE BOTTOM PART BEING
SO LIGHT,

11:21.514 --> 11:23.057
HAVING THAT SHEER LOOK,

11:23.140 --> 11:26.018
THAT'S A SEXY TATTOO.
I THINK IT CAME OUT NICE.

11:26.102 --> 11:26.936
- JAMES,
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.896
- THIS PIECE IS DRAWN ON.
- DRAWN ON.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.565
YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT ADDED
A LITTLE BIT OF STRUGGLE

11:31.649 --> 11:32.608
TO YOUR TATTOO TODAY, MAN.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.235
- THIS TATTOO,

11:34.318 --> 11:35.361
IT HAS SOME MOMENTS WHERE
YOU HIT TEXTURE,

11:35.444 --> 11:36.987
BUT IT HAS A LOT OF MOMENTS
WHERE IT'S NOT THERE.

11:37.071 --> 11:41.492
{\an8}- JAMES' TATTOO, HE'S SHOWING
SOME REALLY BIG INCONSISTENCIES.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.285
{\an8}THIS IS GONNA BE ONE
OF THOSE THINGS

11:43.369 --> 11:46.205
{\an8}THAT COULD SEND HIM PACKING.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.624
- MADDIE,
THE CHALLENGE WAS TEXTURE,

11:48.707 --> 11:50.876
AND YOU GUYS CHOSE
THE ONE GARTER

11:50.960 --> 11:52.044
THAT HAD ONE TEXTURE.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.630
- I REALLY TRIED TO CAPTURE
THE METALLIC FEEL

11:54.713 --> 11:57.216
TO SHOW AT LEAST
THAT TEXTURE REALLY WELL.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.551
- WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE
THE STRUGGLES YOU HAD

11:58.634 --> 12:01.011
WITH OUTLINING THIS.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.763
- TATU BABY.
- YOU'RE A PRETTY FAST TATTOOER.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.974
WE'VE SEEN YOU DO
SOME BIG STUFF QUICK.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.809
- THIS ONE HAS SO MUCH DETAIL
THAT I WAS, LIKE,

12:06.892 --> 12:11.063
I'M JUST GONNA PLAY IT SAFE,
AND WHAT I CAN GET DONE,

12:11.147 --> 12:12.148
INSTEAD OF RUSHING THROUGH IT.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.149
- I REALLY EXPECTED
TO SEE YOU

12:13.232 --> 12:14.400
GET A LOT MORE FINISHED
THAN THIS.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.069
THIS DOESN'T REALLY SHOWCASE
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.239
{\an8}- TATU BABY'S GARTER
DOESN'T EVEN CONNECT.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.452
{\an8}IF YOU DIDN'T FINISH THE TATTOO,
YOU SHOULD GET ELIMINATED.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.789
- WHAT'S INTENSE ABOUT
THIS FLASH CHALLENGE

12:28.873 --> 12:31.834
IS THAT ONE OF THESE ARTISTS
IS GOING HOME...

12:31.917 --> 12:32.835
RIGHT NOW.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.753
LET'S START OFF
WITH JIME.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.173
- JIME'S TATTOO IS GONNA
HEAL SOFTER

12:37.256 --> 12:38.424
AND A LOT MORE DELICATE.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.469
IT WILL LOOK LIKE A BELIEVABLE,
TRANSPARENT GARTER.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.637
- IT'S DEFINITELY
TOP-NOTCH WORK.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.057
JOSHUA DID A REALLY BEAUTIFUL
COLOR PIECE.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.186
- I THINK JOSHUA'S SMART
BECAUSE HE DID A SMALL BAND

12:50.269 --> 12:53.105
WITH A REPETITIVE PATTERN
THAT HE COULD KNOCK OUT QUICK.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.231
PUT A LOT OF DETAIL
IN THAT BOW.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.526
- WE HAVE A FEW IN THE BOTTOM.
WE'VE GOT JAMES DANGER.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.321
- HE DID A PISS-POOR JOB
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

13:00.404 --> 13:02.615
- THAT TATTOO WAS CUT UP,
IT WAS OVER-WORKED.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.366
IT WAS NOT A GOOD TATTOO.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.161
- WHAT ABOUT MADDIE?
- SHE DIDN'T SHOW ANY TEXTURE.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.330
AND, TECHNICALLY,
HER OUTLINE, JACK!

13:09.413 --> 13:11.373
HER SHADING, JACK!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.168
- TATU BABY?
- I THINK TATU BABY IS

13:14.251 --> 13:15.085
COMPLETELY OFF OF HER GAME,

13:15.169 --> 13:18.547
AND SHE DID VERY LITTLE
TATTOOING TODAY.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.757
- IT'S GONNA BE
A SLIPPERY SLOPE FOR HER

13:19.840 --> 13:21.926
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ASK HER BACK,
AMERICA DID.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.012
- ARE YOU GUYS PRETTY SET
ON WHO YOU WANT TO SEND HOME?

13:25.095 --> 13:27.932
- IT'S A TOSS-UP,
BUT I THINK SO.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.477
- ARTISTS, TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO CREATE A GARTER TATTOO

13:31.560 --> 13:34.563
WITH TEXTURE REAL ENOUGH
TO MAKE THESE LADIES' LEGS

13:34.647 --> 13:36.398
EVEN SEXIER.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.901
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

13:38.984 --> 13:42.196
THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

13:45.616 --> 13:47.409
JOSHUA.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.579
[applause]

13:50.663 --> 13:52.414
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK JOSH SHOULD HAVE
WON THE CHALLENGE AT ALL.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.416
{\an8}HE DID A LITTLE, SIMPLE,
BASIC, WAVY BAND.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.709
{\an8}I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE

13:55.793 --> 13:59.129
{\an8}THAT EXECUTED WAY BETTER
TATTOOS THAN THIS.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.007
JOSHUA, YOU WILL HAVE
THE POWER TO ASSIGN

14:02.091 --> 14:04.718
THE HUMAN CANVASES
AT THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.803
- THANK YOU.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.846
- THE REST OF YOU
ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK YET.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.768
ONE OF YOU IS ABOUT
TO CLOSE SHOP.

14:12.851 --> 14:17.147
- MADDIE, THE WAY YOU'RE
EXECUTING YOUR DESIGN,

14:17.231 --> 14:18.774
THE WAY YOU'RE DOING
YOUR OUTLINES,

14:18.857 --> 14:20.109
YOU'RE TAKING HARD KNOCKS.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.111
- I FINISHED IT.
I EXECUTED IT.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.739
AND I THOUGHT I GAVE TEXTURE
WITH THAT METALLIC LOOK.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.366
- WHAT YOU'RE NOT SHOWING US
IS CONSISTENCY

14:27.449 --> 14:30.035
IN YOUR TECHNICAL ABILITY.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.162
- BABY.
PERSONALLY, I'M SURPRISED

14:32.246 --> 14:33.205
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR WORK,

14:33.289 --> 14:36.083
AND I KNOW THAT YOU CAN
BANG OUT TEXTURE.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.209
- I MEAN, I USED UP
ALL MY TIME,

14:37.293 --> 14:38.794
AND I THOUGHT I SHOWED YOU GUYS
DIFFERENT TEXTURES

14:38.877 --> 14:41.589
BY THE LITTLE PIECE
OF THE RIBBON.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.756
- HONESTLY, YOURS WAS ONE
OF THE MOST

14:42.840 --> 14:44.967
DISAPPOINTING TATTOOS
OF THE DAY.

14:45.050 --> 14:48.762
YOU ACCOMPLISHED THE LEAST
AMOUNT OF TATTOOING.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.763
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

14:49.847 --> 14:50.973
GET YOUR HEAD IN IT.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.474
- JAMES.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.393
ROUGHEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY FOR ME

14:54.476 --> 14:58.355
IT'S SO DARK, SO BROWN,
SO BLACK, SO BEAT.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.107
YOU CAN CRINKLE YOUR EYEBROWS
ALL YOU WANT,

15:00.190 --> 15:01.483
THAT THING WAS ATE UP.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.653
- MY TATTOO,
IT LOOKS LIKE A GARTER.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.280
IT LOOKS LIKE A GARTER UP CLOSE.
- BARELY.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.364
- LOOKS LIKE A GARTER FAR AWAY.
I DISAGREE.

15:07.448 --> 15:12.119
- IT WOULD TAKE A LASER
AND A MAGICIAN TO FIX IT.

15:12.202 --> 15:16.123
THAT IS NOT THE WAY
TO TATTOO PEOPLE.

15:16.206 --> 15:19.335
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.260
MADDIE...

15:28.344 --> 15:31.180
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.057
PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.019
{\an8}- I FEEL COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED

15:37.102 --> 15:40.105
{\an8}IT MAKES ME SO MAD
THAT TATU BABY GETS TO STAY.

15:40.189 --> 15:44.568
{\an8}SHE DIDN'T COMPLETE THE
CHALLENGE THAT WE WERE GIVEN.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.287
- YOU THINK THEY GAVE YOU
A BREAK, BABY?

15:55.371 --> 15:57.998
- I REALLY FEEL LIKE
YOU WERE JUST SAVED

15:58.082 --> 15:59.917
BECAUSE ANYONE ELSE WOULD HAVE
DONE WHAT YOU DID,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.710
THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT.
- YEAH.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.421
- WELL, I MEAN,
MY TECHNICAL ABILITIES

16:04.505 --> 16:05.714
COMPARED TO MADDIE'S,
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.884
SHE'S, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS THE ONE
TO SEND HOME.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.386
- I WAS SITTING THERE STRESSING
OUT 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK

16:10.469 --> 16:12.179
I WAS GONNA FINISH,
SO FOR YOU NOT TO FINISH YOURS

16:12.262 --> 16:13.722
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T <i> WANT</i>
TO FINISH IT...

16:13.806 --> 16:15.766
- I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T <i> WANT</i>
TO FINISH MINE.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.476
- YOU DIDN'T MANAGE YOUR TIME
GOOD ENOUGH.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.478
- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
FOUR HOURS, EXECUTE IT.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.230
- I WOULD HAVE [bleep] LOVED
TO HAVE NOT FINISHED MINE.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.524
I COULD HAVE HAD
A BADASS-LOOKING PIECE.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.817
{\an8}- YEAH I DIDN'T FINISH
MY GARTER BELT,

16:24.900 --> 16:26.944
{\an8}BUT I DAMN SURE DESERVE
TO BE HERE.

16:27.027 --> 16:31.115
- JOSH, HOW ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW?

16:31.198 --> 16:34.451
- THIS IS A COMPETITION
THAT INCLUDES AN ADVANTAGE.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.037
I GOTTA POINT A GUN
TO A PERSON'S HEAD

16:37.121 --> 16:38.747
AND SHOOT 'EM IN THE HEAD.
IT'S STILL A PERSON, THOUGH.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.207
I'M STILL KILLING A PERSON.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.417
- OH, I'M ALREADY EXPECTING
FOR YOU

16:41.500 --> 16:43.877
TO GIVE ME THE HUMDINGER
OUT THERE.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.504
- I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA GET
UP THERE AND SCREW EVERYBODY.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.423
THAT'S NOT THE KIND
OF PERSON I AM, SO...

16:47.506 --> 16:48.966
- OH, KISS MY ASS.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.844
YOU CHANGE YOUR TUNE
SO QUICK.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.638
- IN THIS SITUATION, I HAVE TO
CHOOSE EACH PERSON'S FATE.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.015
- OH, GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.991
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.410
BLOW US AWAY,
AND YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER WEEK

17:16.492 --> 17:18.954
TO SHOW US WHY YOU DESERVE
TO BE INK MASTER.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.830
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK,

17:20.914 --> 17:22.374
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.542
TODAY, WE ALSO HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.087
THE OWNER OF ROCK OF AGES
TATTOO SHOP IN AUSTIN, TEXAS,

17:27.171 --> 17:30.507
HE'S BEEN TATTOOING
FOR OVER 15 YEARS.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.594
MR. TONY HUNDAHL.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.763
[cheers and applause]

17:35.846 --> 17:37.598
- YEAH!

17:37.681 --> 17:40.476
{\an8}- I SPECIALIZE IN BIG,
BOLD, POWERFUL TATTOOS.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.060
{\an8}AS A JUDGE, I'M LOOKING FOR
TATTOOS THAT CONVEY

17:42.144 --> 17:45.439
{\an8}A SENSE OF POWER
AND LEAVE AN IMPRESSION.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.523
- THANKS FOR COMING, BUDDY.
- MY PLEASURE.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.484
{\an8}- TONY HUNDAHL IS KNOWN
FOR DOING

17:48.567 --> 17:51.361
{\an8}VERY BIG,
INTENSE TATTOOS.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.989
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF DOING BIG,
MULTI-TEXTURED TATTOOS

17:54.072 --> 17:55.157
IS GONNA COME INTO PLAY HERE.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.409
- AS YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT
YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.995
EACH WEEK, SPIKE AND TACO BELL
ARE GIVING VIEWERS

18:00.078 --> 18:03.624
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO
TO INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

18:03.707 --> 18:05.334
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.003
AMERICA'S VOTE WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

18:08.086 --> 18:09.880
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.300
THIS WEEK'S ELIMINATION TATTOO
IS A TRUE TEST OF TEXTURE.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.219
{\an8}- TEXTURE, AS FAR AS
TATTOOING IS CONCERNED,

18:15.302 --> 18:18.430
{\an8}WE NEED TO ILLUSTRATE
THE LOOK OF HOW THINGS FEEL.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.809
- TODAY, YOU MUST ALL TATTOO...
THE EXACT SAME SUBJECT.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.852
SEEING YOUR TATTOOS
SIDE BY SIDE

18:23.936 --> 18:27.189
WILL MAKE IT OBVIOUS
HOW YOUR TEXTURE

18:27.272 --> 18:28.190
STACKS UP AGAINST
THE COMPETITION.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.317
- THIS IS GONNA WEED OUT
THE WEAKER ARTIST

18:30.400 --> 18:33.612
AND SHOW US WHICH ARTIST IS
REALLY GONNA RISE TO THE TOP.

18:33.695 --> 18:38.242
TODAY, YOU MUST TATTOO
A PHOENIX.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.036
A PHOENIX IS A FIERY,
MYTHOLOGICAL BIRD

18:41.119 --> 18:42.704
THAT GOES UP IN FLAMES,
THEN RISES FROM THE ASHES

18:42.788 --> 18:43.705
TO BE REBORN.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.125
{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.793
{\an8}YOU HAVE FEATHERS,
YOU'VE GOT FLAMES,

18:47.876 --> 18:49.294
{\an8}YOU HAVE BEAKS.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.172
{\an8}YOU'VE GOTTA BALANCE
ALL THOSE TEXTURES IN ONE PIECE.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.841
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.221
- OH, THAT'S CRAZY.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.600
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT
THE OLDER CANVAS.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.560
{\an8}ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

19:04.643 --> 19:06.854
- JOSHUA, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.481
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN

19:09.565 --> 19:11.525
ALL OF THE HUMAN CANVASES.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.443
- I'M SPECIFICALLY TARGETING
THE PEOPLE

19:13.527 --> 19:14.153
THAT I FEEL ARE
A CHALLENGE TO ME.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.072
- I WANT A PHOENIX ON MY RIBS,

19:17.155 --> 19:18.991
AND I WANT THEM TO KEEP IT
SIMPLE, SOPHISTICATED, SEXY.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.617
{\an8}- I'M GONNA DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO WIN.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.119
{\an8}I'M GONNA PISS
SO MANY PEOPLE OFF.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.954
- I WANT A NEW-SCHOOL PHOENIX.
- MM-HMM.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.789
{\an8}- MY STYLE IS NEW-SCHOOL.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.416
{\an8}VERY ANIMATED,
VERY VIBRANT, COLORFUL.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.127
{\an8}COME ON, I GOTTA GET A CHANCE
TO SHINE ONE OF THESE DAYS.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.256
- I'M LOOKING FOR A PHOENIX
ON MY SHOULDER.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.841
I WANT A LOT
OF PRETTY COLORS.

19:35.924 --> 19:38.385
{\an8}- THAT'S REALLY HARD SKIN
TO WORK WITH,

19:38.468 --> 19:39.469
{\an8}AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A MIRACLE

19:39.553 --> 19:41.179
{\an8}TO GET THAT TATTOO
TO LOOK GOOD.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.640
- JOSHUA'S A LITTLE
MISCHIEVOUS.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.225
HE WANTS TO GET IN THERE

19:45.309 --> 19:46.727
AND REALLY STICK IT
TO WHOEVER HE CAN.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.771
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,
PLEASE REVEAL THE NAME

19:49.855 --> 19:51.356
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.691
- ALLY.
- E.S.

19:52.774 --> 19:55.694
- JASON.
- JOSHUA.

19:55.777 --> 19:58.238
- JIME.
- [bleep].

19:58.322 --> 19:59.364
JOSHUA THINKS HE'S
STICKING IT TO ME

19:59.448 --> 20:00.782
BY GIVING ME
A REALISTIC TATTOO.

20:00.866 --> 20:01.825
I'M CAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.660
I'M GONNA JUST PUT IT
IN YOUR [bleep] FACE.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.166
- FOR ME TO HAND HIM SOMETHING

20:09.249 --> 20:11.627
THAT'S GONNA MAKE HIM
LOOK AWESOME WOULD BE STUPID.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.129
{\an8}- KYLE.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.798
{\an8}- JIME GETS THE REALISTIC
PHOENIX,

20:16.882 --> 20:19.551
{\an8}AND I GET
THE NEW-SCHOOL PHOENIX.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.011
{\an8}I'M LIKE COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

20:22.846 --> 20:26.475
- TATU BABY.
- HEY.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.976
{\an8}- JOSHUA CLEARLY WANTED
TO MAKE THIS

20:28.060 --> 20:30.520
{\an8}THE MOST DIFFICULT FOR ME.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.772
{\an8}I'M FREAKING OUT.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.773
- JOEY.

20:32.856 --> 20:33.899
- CRAIG.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.192
- JAMES.

20:35.275 --> 20:35.567
- MADE RICH.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.694
- JACKIE.

20:37.778 --> 20:38.695
- CHRIS.
- HI.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.448
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

20:41.531 --> 20:43.116
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO
THEY THINK IS THE WORST

20:43.200 --> 20:46.495
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.871
YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE EVENING
TO CONSULT

20:47.955 --> 20:49.998
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.751
TOMORROW, YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A PHOENIX.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.254
BASED ON YOUR WORK, ONE OF YOU
WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.715
GOOD LUCK.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.467
- PHOENIXES SHOW
A TON OF TEXTURE AND FEATHERS,

21:00.550 --> 21:02.177
BEAKS, CLAWS,
AND FLAMES.

21:02.260 --> 21:04.554
- BLACK AND GRAY.
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.889
{\an8}- TEXTURE IS WHAT SEPARATES
A LOT

21:05.973 --> 21:10.060
{\an8}OF GREAT TATTOOERS
FROM DECENT TATTOOERS.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.020
- WHAT'S THE LONGEST
YOU'VE EVER SAT FOR A TATTOO?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.981
- ABOUT TWO HOURS.

21:14.064 --> 21:15.691
- TWO HOURS.
I'M ALREADY FREAKING OUT.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.069
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN TAKE
SIX HOURS OF PAIN.

21:19.152 --> 21:24.449
- IF IT TAKES SIX HOURS, THEN
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.869
- YOUR PIECES LOOK
VERY INTRICATE.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.912
- MM-HMM.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.163
- AND I'M VERY SIMPLE.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.416
NOTHING LIKE THAT
IS GOING ON MY BODY.

21:32.499 --> 21:36.420
- SO YOU WANT A NON-INTRICATE
PHOENIX TO SHOW TEXTURE.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.337
PHOENIXES ARE COMPLICATED.

21:37.421 --> 21:41.383
{\an8}IT'S A BIRD WITH PLUMAGE
AND FEATHERS

21:41.466 --> 21:42.467
{\an8}AND TEXTURE
AND FIRE.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.303
{\an8}- AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND,
LIKE, I SAID SIMPLE.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.888
{\an8}- WE NEED TO SHOW TEXTURE,
OR THERE'S NO REASON

21:46.972 --> 21:47.973
{\an8}ME DOING THE PIECE.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.559
{\an8}- WHEN YOU FIRST MEET SOMEONE

21:50.642 --> 21:52.811
{\an8}AND THEY TELL YOU
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO,

21:52.894 --> 21:53.979
{\an8}NO, WE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK TOGETHER.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.647
{\an8}I'M WILLING TO COMPROMISE,

21:55.731 --> 21:57.232
{\an8}BUT YOU DON'T JUST COME OUT
AND SAY WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

21:57.315 --> 21:59.943
THAT'S NOT EVEN DEBATABLE.
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.195
CALM DOWN. I WON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO DO.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.238
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.197
[bleep].

22:04.281 --> 22:05.657
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.577
SIMPLE.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.459
SO THE CHALLENGE
IS TO SHOW TEXTURE,

22:15.542 --> 22:18.920
BUT, LIKE, MY CLIENT
WANTS IT SIMPLE.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.881
SHE WAS SUPER COMBATIVE
WITH ME TOO.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.091
- MAN, DANGER IS DEFINITELY
GONNA BE IN TROUBLE TODAY.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.760
- SHE'S COMING IN HERE

22:24.843 --> 22:26.678
WITH A SWITCHBLADE
AND A TASER.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.597
- THAT'S A BIG PART OF TATTOOS,
IS GETTING ALONG

22:28.680 --> 22:29.598
WITH YOUR CUSTOMER, DUDE.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.348
I DON'T WANT SOME DICKHEAD

22:30.432 --> 22:32.559
TATTOOING ME, DUDE,
HONESTLY.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.772
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS

22:36.855 --> 22:38.857
TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN CREATE
MIND-BLOWING TEXTURE

22:38.940 --> 22:41.109
BY TATTOOING A PHOENIX,

22:41.193 --> 22:44.529
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.822
- LET'S DO THIS, MAN.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.199
- LET'S GO.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.366
{\an8}- THERE'S A LOT
OF DIFFERENT THINGS

22:48.450 --> 22:50.077
{\an8}THAT YOU COULD PUT
INTO THIS TATTOO TO SHOW

22:50.160 --> 22:51.745
{\an8}A WIDE RANGE
OF TEXTURES.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.829
IF THEY'RE DOING A FEATHER,
THEY CAN MAKE IT

22:52.913 --> 22:53.580
LOOK SOFT LIKE A FEATHER.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.499
IF YOU'RE DOING CLAWS,
YOU PUT

22:55.582 --> 22:57.626
THE TEXTURE OF THE TALONS
TO MAKE 'EM LOOK SHARP.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.712
- OH, IT LOOKS AWESOME.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.548
- ALL RIGHT.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.301
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
DID YOU SEE THE DRAWING?

23:06.384 --> 23:08.637
- LISTEN, WAIT A MINUTE,
BEFORE WE BEGIN, WE'RE GOOD?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.222
'CAUSE YESTERDAY
WE KIND OF ENDED NOT GOOD.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.974
WE GOOD TODAY?
- I'M GREAT TODAY. YEAH.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.227
- OKAY, OKAY, 'CAUSE YOU WERE
KIND OF YELLING YESTERDAY,

23:15.310 --> 23:16.436
SO I JUST WASN'T--
- I WASN'T YELLING.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.188
- YOU YELLED.
- I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.815
- OKAY.
- I'VE BEEN GOOD ALL MORNING.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.566
{\an8}- OKAY.
ME AND YOU HAVE AN ISSUE,

23:21.650 --> 23:23.151
{\an8}DON'T PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING DIDN'T HAPPEN.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.236
{\an8}DON'T PRETEND
LIKE [bleep] AIN'T RIGHT.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.237
{\an8}I'M A REAL PERSON.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.988
- THIS IS HOW I WOULD LIKE
TO DO IT

23:27.072 --> 23:28.281
WITH MORE LINE WORK.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.867
- I DON'T LIKE THIS PART.
I LIKE THIS.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.286
- NOW SHE'S NITPICKING
MY DRAWINGS.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.830
IT'S LIKE, WHAT THE [bleep]?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.081
- WE GOT TO BE IN BETWEEN.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.165
I NEED TO ADD
A LITTLE SOMETHING,

23:37.249 --> 23:38.750
SO WE GOT TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.585
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT HIS DESIGN.
I'M HAPPY.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.588
IF WE CAN GET THE ATTITUDE
IN LINE WITH THE DESIGN,

23:43.672 --> 23:47.050
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
THE BEST TATTOO.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.803
- IT'S GOING TO BE EXCITING.

23:49.886 --> 23:51.304
- I HAVE SO MUCH PRESSURE
ON MY SHOULDERS.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.015
ANY KIND OF MOVEMENT
THAT YOU MAKE--

23:54.099 --> 23:56.101
FEEL YOU NEED TO DO,
LET ME KNOW.

23:56.184 --> 23:57.686
I DEFINITELY NEED
TO REDEEM MYSELF

23:57.769 --> 23:59.688
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FINISH
THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

23:59.771 --> 24:01.273
READY?

24:01.356 --> 24:02.190
I'M FINISHING THIS TATTOO.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.860
- ONE HOUR DOWN,
FIVE TO GO.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.528
- HERE WE GO.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.408
- SO YOU LIKE THIS PART HERE?

24:11.491 --> 24:12.868
- I'LL LOOK AT IT AGAIN
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

24:12.951 --> 24:15.203
BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT I INITIALLY SAID.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.538
- SHE KEEPS RIDING ME
AND RIDING ME.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.916
MY ADRENALINE'S PUMPING.
I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.251
I'M FREAKING OUT.
- YOU NERVOUS?

24:21.334 --> 24:24.212
YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.
- YOU AFFECT MY MOOD, BUT I AM--

24:24.296 --> 24:25.547
- I AFFECT YOUR MOOD?

24:25.630 --> 24:26.715
- I AM GONNA BE GOOD.

24:26.798 --> 24:27.883
- BUT YOUR HANDS ARE SHAKING.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.759
- A LITTLE BIT.
IT'LL BE FINE.

24:29.843 --> 24:33.054
JAMES IS ABOUT TO PICK
SOMETHING UP AND INK MY BODY,

24:33.138 --> 24:35.182
AND HE'S TELLING ME
I AFFECT HIS MOOD.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.475
JAMES, YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS,

24:37.559 --> 24:40.020
'CAUSE YOUR HANDS
ARE SHAKING AND--

24:40.103 --> 24:42.147
- MY HAND'S FINE.
- YOUR HAND IS SHAKING--

24:42.230 --> 24:44.399
- YEAH, IT'S SHAKING
A LITTLE BIT.

24:44.482 --> 24:45.442
IT'S UP TO YOU
IF YOU WANT TO SIT OR NOT.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.527
- ARE YOU NERVOUS?
- NO, I'M NOT NERVOUS.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.362
- DOES YOUR HAND USUALLY--
YOU UNDERSTAND

24:49.446 --> 24:51.406
WHY THAT WOULD MAKE ME NERVOUS?

24:51.489 --> 24:52.824
- DEALING WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF CONFRONTATION

24:52.908 --> 24:54.826
I'M NEVER GOOD WITH,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT IS.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.912
- IF SOMEONE LOOKS NERVOUS,
YOUR ARTIST,

24:56.995 --> 24:58.705
AND THEY'RE SHAKING,
YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE CONCERNED,

24:58.788 --> 25:01.791
WOULDN'T YOU?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.376
IF YOU'RE GONNA IGNORE ME,
THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.586
- WELL, NO, 'CAUSE I'M TRYING
TO CALM DOWN,

25:04.669 --> 25:06.046
AND YOU'RE AGGRAVATING
THE SITUATION,

25:06.129 --> 25:07.672
SO I'M JUST TRYING--I'M JUST
TRYING TO GET IN MY ZEN.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.591
- I NEED YOU TO CALM ME--
I NEED YOU TO CALM ME DOWN.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.010
- WELL, I NEED TO GET
IN MY ZEN SO I CAN TATTOO YOU.

25:12.093 --> 25:14.804
- WELL, I'M THE ONE GETTING
THE TATTOO THAT'S PERMANENT.

25:14.888 --> 25:15.972
I NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE GOOD.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.098
I'M THE ONE WHO'S NERVOUS.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.100
MAKE ME FEEL CONFIDENT
IN YOU.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.645
THAT'S WHAT YOUR JOB IS.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.314
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE PUTTING
A TATTOO ON A PERSON, RIGHT?

25:24.397 --> 25:25.899
- MM-HMM.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.901
- AND IF YOU DON'T CARE,
KEEP IT REAL, TELL ME.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.945
- I DID. I TOLD YOU IT'S--
- I'LL WALK OUT.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.321
- I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT
DO THIS TO ME BEFORE.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.864
I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT SIT
AND PICK AT ME.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.658
- I'VE NEVER HAD
A TATTOO ARTIST SHAKING.

25:34.741 --> 25:35.242
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE SITTING
AND YOU'RE PICKING

25:35.325 --> 25:37.077
AT ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.578
- SO YOU DON'T CARE REALLY.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.996
THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.456
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TATTOO.

25:41.539 --> 25:42.791
SAY IT NOW, WE'RE DONE.

25:42.874 --> 25:43.458
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.502
I'M NOT THE ARTIST FOR YOU.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.796
I REALLY DON'T THINK I AM.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.422
- THAT'S IT.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.132
I'M DONE.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.009
NO ONE'S EVER GONNA DO ANYTHING
TO ME

25:53.093 --> 25:53.760
THAT I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.220
IF I HAVE TO BE THE QUEEN BITCH,

25:55.303 --> 25:56.471
I WILL BE THE QUEEN BITCH,

25:56.554 --> 25:57.514
BUT YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING ME.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.432
- OH, MY GOD.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.433
I'M [bleep].

26:00.517 --> 26:02.310
I ALMOST HAD
A PANIC ATTACK, MAN.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.145
I'M PETRIFIED
THIS IS GONNA COST ME

26:04.229 --> 26:07.691
THIS COMPETITION.

26:07.774 --> 26:10.151
{\an8}- THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT
FOR US.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.736
{\an8}- [bleep] IT.
I'LL TATTOO MYSELF.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.322
- YOU LET HER WALK.
- I DESERVE TO [bleep] BE HERE.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.156
- THERE'S NO PART OF THIS TATTOO
THAT'S NOT JACKED.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.492
- [silently] WOW.

26:21.705 --> 26:22.872
- TWO HOURS REMAIN, EVERYBODY.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.582
[needle buzzing]

26:29.921 --> 26:32.257
- I DEFINITELY THINK
DANGER'S SCREWED NOW.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.508
HIS CANVAS LEFT.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.385
NOBODY WANTS TO GET TATTOOED
BY A [bleep].

26:35.468 --> 26:36.761
HE MIGHT GET ELIMINATED.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.431
- DANGER CLEARLY HANDLED
HIS SITUATION WRONG.

26:39.514 --> 26:40.515
THIS IS A PERSON, AND YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS

26:40.598 --> 26:42.851
OF WHAT IT TAKES
TO CONNECT WITH A PERSON.

26:42.934 --> 26:47.022
HE OBVIOUSLY HAS NO FRIGGIN'
CLUE ON HOW TO DO THAT.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.440
- I AM MENTALLY SHOCKED.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.151
I'M LIKE, WELL, OKAY,
[bleep] IT.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.360
I'LL TATTOO MYSELF.
NO.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.989
I'M NOT GONNA DESTROY
MY LEG.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.866
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA PUT THAT PHOENIX
ON MY LEG.

26:57.949 --> 26:59.701
WHY AM I GONNA BE REMINDED

26:59.784 --> 27:02.120
EVERY DAY OF THIS [bleep] BITCH?

27:07.375 --> 27:08.043
- MY TATTOO HAS GOT
A LOT OF DEPTH,

27:08.126 --> 27:10.337
A LOT OF TEXTURE.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.129
{\an8}YOU SCREWED YOURSELF
ON THIS ONE, JOSH.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.422
{\an8}YOU HANDED ME A GOOD ONE.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.424
{\an8}- THIS GUY ASKED
FOR A REALISTIC PHOENIX,

27:14.507 --> 27:15.592
{\an8}AND JIME'S DOING
A NEW SCHOOL VULTURE ON HIM,

27:15.675 --> 27:18.470
PROVING THAT HE REALLY
CAN'T HANDLE ANYTHING

27:18.553 --> 27:20.513
BUT CARTOON WORK.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.890
I PICKED A VERY DIFFICULT SPOT.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.975
I PICKED
A VERY CHALLENGING DESIGN.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.310
THIS IS A BADASS BIRD.

27:25.393 --> 27:26.603
I WANT TO OUTSHINE EVERYBODY.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.731
- YOU HAD THE CHOICE
TO PICK YOUR OWN CANVAS,

27:29.814 --> 27:31.274
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU
ENDED UP WITH?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.777
IT LOOKS JUST
LIKE A BIG EVIL RED PARAKEET.

27:33.860 --> 27:36.279
THAT'S KARMA BEING A BITCH.

27:36.363 --> 27:39.366
- ONE HOUR REMAINING.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.286
- OH, GOD.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.871
- HOW'S IT GOING, GUYS?

27:44.954 --> 27:47.082
- IT'S MY FIRST NEW SCHOOL
PIECE, ACTUALLY.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.250
{\an8}THERE IS NO TEXTURE
THAT I CAN THINK TO PUT IN IT.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.919
ALL I HAVE LEFT
TO WORK WITH

27:51.002 --> 27:52.754
IS ADDING STUFF
AROUND THE PHOENIX.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.130
- IS THAT HAWAII?

27:54.214 --> 27:56.633
- I HAVE TO WORK ON THOSE EMBERS
A LITTLE BIT MORE I'M GUESSING.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.427
- HE'S SAYING
THAT THEY'RE CALLED EMBERS.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.095
{\an8}I DON'T SEE
ANY FIRE ANYWHERE.

28:00.178 --> 28:04.641
{\an8}- OH, IT'S NOT HAWAII.

28:04.724 --> 28:06.684
{\an8}- THIS LADY
IS MY NEW ROLE MODEL.

28:06.768 --> 28:07.519
{\an8}I WANT TO BE 84 YEARS OLD

28:07.602 --> 28:10.271
{\an8}GETTING A [bleep] BAD ASS TATTOO

28:10.355 --> 28:11.731
{\an8}AND SITTING LIKE A ROCK.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.068
I'M PROVING
THAT I CAN TATTOO ANYTHING.

28:15.151 --> 28:18.154
- TEN, NINE,

28:18.238 --> 28:19.114
EIGHT, SEVEN,

28:19.197 --> 28:21.324
SIX, FIVE,

28:21.408 --> 28:26.496
FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.165
THAT IS IT.
TIME IS UP.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.959
MACHINES DOWN.
NO MORE INK.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.419
- ALL RIGHT.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.629
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GORGEOUS.

28:34.712 --> 28:35.046
OH, I LOVE IT.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.215
- WHAT?

28:37.298 --> 28:38.716
LOVE IT.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.676
- I'M JUST HOPING THE EMBERS
MAKE SENSE.

28:39.759 --> 28:43.513
EVEN IF I'M IN THE BOTTOM,
I DID A TATTOO.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.098
BUT DANGER REALLY SCREWED
HIMSELF.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.767
- WHAT'S UP, SIR?

28:47.851 --> 28:50.103
- MY CLIENT WALKED.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.646
- LET'S HAVE A CHAT, MAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:51.729 --> 28:52.230
- COME ON OVER.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.983
SO WHAT HAPPENED, BRO?

28:55.066 --> 28:57.444
- SHE WAS JUST REALLY ABRASIVE,

28:57.527 --> 28:59.821
AND SHE STARTED BACKING ME
INTO A CORNER.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.156
- HERE'S THE THING.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.740
THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT
FOR US.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.992
NOBODY'S EVER WALKED OUT.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.577
YOU DON'T HAVE A TATTOO
FOR US TO LOOK AT.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.370
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,
IS THE FOUR OF US HAVE

29:07.454 --> 29:09.831
TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER,

29:09.914 --> 29:11.207
TALK TO THE CANVAS,

29:11.291 --> 29:13.001
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO EVALUATE

29:13.084 --> 29:13.585
AMONGST OURSELVES
TO FIGURE OUT

29:13.668 --> 29:19.174
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.925
- DANGER'S GOING HOME
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO A TATTOO.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.887
- DANGER GOT [bleep]
THE WHOLE HARD WAY.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.056
- BUT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE
COULDN'T DO WHAT SHE WANTED.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.516
- THAT'S WHY
HE'LL BE GOING HOME.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.934
YOU HAVE
TO APPEASE YOUR CLIENT.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.311
- HIS CLIENT BASICALLY
WAS JUST LIKE,

29:31.394 --> 29:33.521
"I'M NOT EVEN GIVING YOU
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO ANYTHING."

29:33.605 --> 29:35.023
- I THINK I COULD HAVE HANDLED
THE SITUATION

29:35.106 --> 29:36.024
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
- BUT IT'S EASY TO SAY,

29:36.107 --> 29:38.359
"YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE ACCOMMODATING.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.319
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THIS.
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAT."

29:39.402 --> 29:40.487
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SUCH A BITCH.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.864
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TREATED

29:42.947 --> 29:44.240
YOUR ARTIST LIKE A DICKHEAD.

29:44.324 --> 29:44.824
YOU WANT A [bleep] TATTOO,

29:44.908 --> 29:46.534
BE NICE TO THE GUY.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.620
- WELL, IN MY OPINION,
IF ANYONE WENT HOME

29:48.703 --> 29:52.790
BUT DANGER, THEY GOT EVERY RIGHT
TO BE PISSED OFF.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.876
- SO, NATALIE, TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.002
WHAT WENT WRONG TODAY?
- TO START OFF,

29:56.085 --> 29:59.172
EVERYTHING WAS OKAY,
AND THEN HIS HAND WAS SHAKING.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.717
SO I WAS KIND OF TAKEN ABACK,
AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT THAT.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.260
AND HE SAID, "WELL, IT'S YOU.
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS."

30:04.344 --> 30:06.763
I ACTUALLY GOT SCARED.

30:06.846 --> 30:10.683
- SO ULTIMATELY,
WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE

30:10.767 --> 30:12.227
AND YOU WERE GONNA WALK
OUT OF HERE--

30:12.310 --> 30:13.186
- I WASN'T.
I HAD NO INTENTION OF LEAVING.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.897
- HE SAID, "I AM NOT
THE ARTIST FOR YOU."

30:15.980 --> 30:19.484
- YOU'RE SAYING TO US
THAT JAMES DECIDED

30:19.567 --> 30:21.277
THIS ISN'T WORKING,
WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.779
- HE PUNKED OUT.
- PUNKED OUT.

30:22.862 --> 30:25.073
- HE PUNKED OUT.
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.116
- THANK YOU, GUYS.
NICE MEETING YOU GUYS.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.911
- IT WAS [bleep] KILLING ME.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.455
SHE WAS LIKE, "ADD THIS LINE,
THAT LINE, AND I WANT THIS

30:32.539 --> 30:34.666
AND THIS.
I DON'T WANT THAT."

30:34.749 --> 30:36.918
- BUT, DANGER, HONESTLY,
WERE YOU BEING A DICK AT ALL?

30:37.001 --> 30:38.586
- NO, I MEAN--
- FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO

30:38.670 --> 30:40.463
IS SEE EYE TO EYE.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.881
- I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I CAN
ALWAYS CATER TO SOMEBODY.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.384
EVEN IF IT IS
THAT LAST "MAKE THIS LINE HERE.

30:44.467 --> 30:45.760
MAKE THIS LINE HERE."

30:45.843 --> 30:48.012
I'VE HAD THOSE CLIENTS,
PLENTY OF THEM.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.222
- DUDE, YEAH, ME TOO, MAN.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.306
I OWN MY OWN SHOP.

30:50.390 --> 30:51.975
BUT SHE WAS JUST GETTING AT ME
AND GETTING

30:52.058 --> 30:52.559
AT ME AND GETTING AT ME.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.519
AND I WAS JUST LIKE,

30:54.602 --> 30:56.854
MAYBE I'M NOT THE ARTIST
FOR YOU.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.731
BOOM.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.567
{\an8}- "MAYBE I'M NOT THE ARTIST
FOR YOU."

31:00.650 --> 31:02.610
IF SOMEBODY SAID THAT TO ME,

31:02.694 --> 31:05.154
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T WANT THEM
TO TATTOO ME EITHER.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.073
- I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME,

31:07.156 --> 31:10.076
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.331
- WE'VE HEARD FROM JAMES.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.541
WE'VE HEARD
FROM THE CLIENT.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.126
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE HE WENT

31:18.209 --> 31:19.794
AROUND IN CIRCLES
TRYING TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

31:19.877 --> 31:22.338
- BUT HE HAS
AN ABRASIVE PERSONALITY.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.841
- BEFORE WE BEGIN, WE'RE GOOD?
- I'M GREAT.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.467
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE
KIND OF YELLING YESTERDAY,

31:26.551 --> 31:27.969
SO I JUST WANT TO--
- I WASN'T YELLING.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.387
- YOU YELLED.
- I DON'T SEE HIM

31:29.470 --> 31:31.097
BEING ABRASIVE.
- THEY WERE BITCHES.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.432
IT WAS TWO BITCHES FIGHTING.

31:32.515 --> 31:33.808
- THEY BOTH DEFINITELY PLAYED
A BIG PART.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.810
- YOU NERVOUS?
YOUR HAND IS SHAKING.

31:35.893 --> 31:36.894
- I'M GONNA BE GOOD.

31:36.978 --> 31:37.687
- BUT YOUR HAND IS SHAKING.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.731
- A LITTLE BIT.
IT'LL BE FINE.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.691
- SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET TATTOOED

31:41.774 --> 31:42.609
'CAUSE THE DESIGN SUCKS.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.986
- THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM, BRO.

31:45.069 --> 31:45.737
"YOU'RE NERVOUS.
YOU'RE NERVOUS.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.905
ARE YOU OKAY?
ARE YOU OKAY?"

31:47.989 --> 31:49.490
LIKE, IF YOU DO THIS LONG ENOUGH
TO SOMEONE,

31:49.574 --> 31:51.075
IT'S GONNA [bleep] BE SORE.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.660
- I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT SIT
AND PICK AT ME--

31:52.744 --> 31:54.162
- I'VE NEVER HAD A TATTOO ARTIST
SHAKING AND BEING NERVOUS.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.080
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING HERE
PICKING AT ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.333
- HE SAT DOWN
IN A LITTLE CROUCH POSITION

31:58.416 --> 31:59.042
AND ACTED
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

31:59.125 --> 32:01.294
BEDSIDE MANNER IS EVERYTHING.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.379
YOU PUT YOUR HAND
ON HER ARM AND YOU GO,

32:03.463 --> 32:04.797
"HEY, WE'RE GONNA WORK
THROUGH THIS.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.174
WE'RE GOOD."
- ALL HE HAD TO SAY WAS,

32:06.257 --> 32:08.092
"I'M HERE FOR YOU."
- I FEEL

32:08.176 --> 32:09.469
LIKE SHE PUSHED HIM
INTO A CORNER

32:09.552 --> 32:11.721
WHERE HE SAID,
"MAYBE I'M NOT THE GUY FOR YOU."

32:11.804 --> 32:13.681
- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TATTOO.
SAY IT NOW, WE'RE DONE.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.683
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.352
I'M NOT THE ARTIST FOR YOU.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.478
- THAT'S IT.

32:18.561 --> 32:21.356
- IF HE WAS DESERVING
OF THE TITLE "INK MASTER,"

32:21.439 --> 32:23.107
THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN
TO THAT POINT.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.318
- I GUESS THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
THIS ISN'T <i> THERAPY MASTER.</i>

32:25.401 --> 32:25.985
- YEAH.
- THIS IS <i> INK MASTER.</i>

32:26.069 --> 32:26.986
- LOOK, WE'RE SHOP OWNERS.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.988
THIS WOULD NOT FLY IN OUR SHOPS.
- NO. NEVER.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.657
- YOU DON'T WANT AN ARTIST
WORKING IN YOUR SHOP

32:30.740 --> 32:33.242
THAT'S GONNA RUN BUSINESS AWAY.

32:33.326 --> 32:36.079
- BUT I DON'T THINK HE DESERVES
TO GO HOME FOR THAT.

32:36.162 --> 32:38.206
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S GET
TO THE CRITIQUE,

32:38.289 --> 32:40.208
AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM
OUT ON THE FLOOR.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.542
- YEAH.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.937
- TODAY WE TOSSED YOU
INTO THE FIRE

33:01.020 --> 33:03.731
BY MAKING ALL OF YOU
TATTOO A PHOENIX,

33:03.815 --> 33:06.651
GIVING US A SIDE-BY-SIDE
COMPARISON OF TEXTURE.

33:06.734 --> 33:10.863
JOSHUA, LET'S START WITH YOU.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.865
- WHEN I'M THINKING
ABOUT A PHOENIX, THIS POWERFUL,

33:12.949 --> 33:14.450
MAGICAL CREATURE,

33:14.534 --> 33:15.785
THIS DOESN'T REALLY DO
ANY OF THAT.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.495
IT LOOKS
LIKE AN ANGRY COCKATIEL

33:17.578 --> 33:19.122
HOLDING A BABY.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.581
- THAT'S NOT A BABY.
THAT'S A MAN.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.583
THERE'S NO DENYING
THAT THAT'S A MAN.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.253
- I WOULD HAVE TO DENY
THAT THAT LOOKS LIKE A MAN.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.088
- WE ALL AGREE
WE DON'T LIKE THE DESIGN.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.048
I THINK YOU DROPPED
THE BALL ON THIS ONE BAD.

33:30.383 --> 33:34.971
- JOEY.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.764
- GOOD THING ABOUT THIS TATTOO
IS, RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

33:36.848 --> 33:38.307
IT'S A PHOENIX
COME OUT OF THE FLAMES.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.350
EASILY READABLE.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.102
I JUST WISH
THAT THERE WAS

33:41.185 --> 33:42.311
A LITTLE MORE TEXTURE
IN THE WINGS.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.522
AS FAR AS WHERE YOU DID HIT
THE TEXTURE

33:44.605 --> 33:45.648
IN THE FLAMES
AT THE BOTTOM,

33:45.732 --> 33:46.941
DOING THIS KIND OF REALISTIC,
DEEP HOLLOW PITS

33:47.024 --> 33:50.027
OF BLACK, IT'S A HARD TATTOO
TO PULL OFF, MAN,

33:50.111 --> 33:53.197
AND I THINK YOU DID
A GOOD JOB.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.325
- RICH.

33:56.409 --> 33:58.119
IF YOU TAKE TWO STEPS BACK
FROM THIS TATTOO,

33:58.202 --> 34:00.788
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.540
- I WANTED IT TO SEEM
LIKE THE PHOENIX WAS RISING

34:02.623 --> 34:03.666
OUT OF THE ASHES.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.625
- IT'S MORE OF A ROOSTER

34:04.709 --> 34:06.461
HAVING AN AIR BATTLE
WITH SOMETHING ELSE

34:06.544 --> 34:07.170
'CAUSE YOU BALLED IT UP.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.170
IF YOU OPEN IT UP,
YOU HAVE

34:08.254 --> 34:11.466
A GREAT TATTOO ON YOUR HANDS.
- THANK YOU.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.926
- JIME.

34:15.719 --> 34:17.304
- GOOD, CLEAN, SOLID TATTOO,
MAN.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.806
THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT,
TODAY BEING TEXTURE DAY,

34:18.889 --> 34:20.725
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE YOU REALLY GAVE THIS

34:20.808 --> 34:23.101
THOSE LITTLE, TRICKY TEXTURES.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.603
- NO.
IF I WOULD HAVE SHRUNK THAT DOWN

34:24.687 --> 34:26.230
ABOUT AN HOUR SIZE,
I THINK THAT'S

34:26.313 --> 34:27.648
WHAT IT WOULD HAVE NEEDED.

34:27.732 --> 34:28.858
- AS FAR
AS YOUR TECHNICAL APPLICATION,

34:28.940 --> 34:32.612
THIS IS THE SMOOTH, SOLID,
SEASONED TATTOOER APPLICATION.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.655
IT'S JUST DONE WELL.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.824
- THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR YOUR TIME.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.869
- KYLE.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.913
YOU WERE GIVEN
THE NEW SCHOOL DESIGN.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.331
- I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE
NEW SCHOOL.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.000
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND

34:46.083 --> 34:49.170
WHAT PURPOSE THOSE LITTLE BLOCKS
SERVE IN THAT DESIGN.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.839
WAS THAT THE ATTEMPT
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

34:51.922 --> 34:54.050
TO DO SOME TEXTURE?
- ADD SOME TEXTURE

34:54.132 --> 34:56.177
TO A NEW SCHOOL TATTOO,
SO THOSE ARE EMBERS.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.096
- UNLESS YOU WERE
TO TELL SOMEONE THAT,

34:58.179 --> 35:00.181
THERE'S NOTHING THERE TO TELL
YOU THAT THOSE ARE EMBERS.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.891
- THIS ISN'T A TATTOO
THAT'S GONNA SEND YOU HOME,

35:01.974 --> 35:04.769
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU
THE "W."

35:04.852 --> 35:06.938
- JACKIE.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.189
- YOU DID A BIG TATTOO
WITH A LOT OF DETAIL.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.858
YOU WERE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
THAT GOT IN THERE

35:10.942 --> 35:12.652
AND TRIED TO SHADE,
SOME FEATHER TEXTURE.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.862
BUT THE RANDOM PLACEMENT
OF RED THROUGHOUT,

35:14.946 --> 35:15.947
IT KIND OF THROWS IT OFF.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.448
THAT LITTLE RED POCKET
OF FEATHERS

35:17.532 --> 35:20.159
IN THE WINGS
AND THE RED FRINGE ON THE LEGS,

35:20.243 --> 35:21.452
IT'S VERY CONFUSING.

35:21.536 --> 35:24.705
- JASON.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.042
- THE PLACEMENT IS THE FIRST
THING THAT JUMPED AT ME.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.877
THIS THING IS PLACED
SO WEIRD.

35:29.961 --> 35:30.670
- THE FACT THAT HE WANTED IT
ON HIS BACK,

35:30.753 --> 35:33.548
I WENT AS BIG AS I COULD,

35:33.631 --> 35:36.259
AND THAT THING'S LIKE THE SIZE
OF A SHEET OF PAPER, 8 1/2x11.

35:36.342 --> 35:41.222
- IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S CRAMMED
INSIDE AN 8 1/2x11 BOX.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.473
- YOU WOULD HAVE ESCAPED
THE PROBLEMS

35:42.557 --> 35:43.933
THAT TONY'S HAVING
WITH THIS TATTOO

35:44.016 --> 35:46.477
IF YOU JUST TAKE THE BIRD
AND ROTATE IT A LITTLE BIT

35:46.561 --> 35:48.104
AND MAKE THE OTHER WING
FANNING.

35:48.187 --> 35:51.816
IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS THING
MORE UPWARD MOTION.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.943
- CHRIS.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.778
- THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS
OF THIS TATTOO

35:55.862 --> 35:56.946
THAT YOUR EYE'S DRAWN TO,

35:57.029 --> 35:59.448
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CLAWS

35:59.532 --> 36:00.283
ARE ONE OF THOSE FOCAL POINTS.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.451
- IT LOOKS LIKE EACH TOE
ON THERE

36:02.535 --> 36:03.202
HAS BEEN BROKEN.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.329
- YOU JACKED IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.748
- E.S.

36:07.832 --> 36:10.710
- THE ONLY REAL SPOTS

36:10.793 --> 36:12.378
THAT YOU CAPTURED TEXTURE
IS IN THE TAIL FEATHERS,

36:12.461 --> 36:14.881
BUT NOT THROUGHOUT, AND MOST
OF THAT WAS DUE TO LINE WORK.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.757
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING
WITH THIS MUCH LINE WORK,

36:16.841 --> 36:19.218
BE METICULOUS.
- THIS IS A COMPETITION SETTING.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.513
YOU NEED TO PULL
A CLEAN, STRAIGHT LINE.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.099
- CRAIG.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.726
- YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT SOLIDLY NAILED

36:26.809 --> 36:29.437
MULTIPLE KINDS OF TEXTURE.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.606
THE TEXTURE YOU PUT
IN THE BIRD ITSELF,

36:31.689 --> 36:32.815
THE BEAK, THE EYE, THE TEETH,

36:32.899 --> 36:34.775
THE SKULL,
THE FEATHERS,

36:34.859 --> 36:35.860
I LOVE THIS TATTOO.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.320
- YOU'RE RISING TO THE TOP

36:37.403 --> 36:41.324
AND MAKING PEOPLE CHASE YOU
AROUND THIS COMPETITION.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.702
- ALLY.

36:44.785 --> 36:46.579
- THIS THING'S A MESS.

36:46.662 --> 36:48.748
THE SMOKE AROUND IT,
YOU GOT A TEXTURE

36:48.831 --> 36:49.707
OUT OF THAT SMOKE.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.626
IT'S JUST A TEXTURE
THAT LOOKS REALLY BAD.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.419
THE LITTLE BIT OF FIRE
THAT'S AT THE BOTTOM,

36:53.502 --> 36:55.171
YOU CAN'T TELL THE FIRE
APART FROM THE BODY.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.006
- HE WAS PRETTY STERN
WITH WHAT HE WANTED.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.758
- YOU CAN'T BLAME ANY
OF THAT [bleep]

36:58.841 --> 37:00.843
ON ONE OF THE CLIENTS.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.804
THE ABILITY TO EARN
THE TITLE INK MASTER

37:03.888 --> 37:05.765
COMES INTO PLAY
WHEN YOU CAN INCORPORATE

37:05.848 --> 37:08.809
THAT PERSON'S IDEAS, BUT STILL
MAKE A REALLY GOOD TATTOO

37:08.893 --> 37:11.812
OUT OF THEIR IDEAS.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.606
- TATU BABY.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.732
- FOR ANYBODY
TO GET THIS CLIENT,

37:14.815 --> 37:16.943
I'M GLAD IT'S SOMEBODY

37:17.026 --> 37:19.153
THAT COULD NOT OVERLY WORK
THEIR DELICATE SKIN.

37:19.236 --> 37:21.781
YOU PUT A TON OF TEXTURE IN IT,
AND I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.658
- ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I DO LOVE ABOUT THIS

37:23.741 --> 37:24.867
IS THE WAY THAT YOU DID
THE TAIL FEATHERS

37:24.951 --> 37:27.036
AND YOU FLIPPED THEM UP AND YOU
DID DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.205
YOU TOOK TIME
TO PLAN THAT OUT.

37:29.288 --> 37:31.832
THE DETAIL THAT YOU GOT
INTO THIS PIECE

37:31.916 --> 37:34.251
LOOKS REALLY GREAT.

37:34.335 --> 37:37.505
- JAMES DANGER.

37:38.631 --> 37:42.009
WE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED IN YOUR SHOP.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.678
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD?

37:43.761 --> 37:45.429
- I WAS REALLY EXCITED
WHEN PHOENIX CAME UP.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.515
JUST THE WAY
THAT SHE WANTED IT DONE

37:47.598 --> 37:48.474
WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.850
SHE HAD SO MUCH TENSION
IN THE AIR,

37:49.934 --> 37:51.352
MY HAND STARTED TO SHAKE.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.853
- WHEN YOU HAVE
A DIFFICULT CLIENT,

37:52.937 --> 37:54.438
THE MORE YOU FIGHT BACK,
THE MORE THEY FIGHT BACK.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.690
- NO, I'M NOT TRYING
TO BABYSIT.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.524
- IT'S JUST GRABBING YOUR CLIENT

37:56.607 --> 37:58.192
AND TAKING CONTROL
OF THE SITUATION

37:58.275 --> 38:00.736
OUT OF THE GATE, BECAUSE
THEN THIS THING ESCALATED

38:00.820 --> 38:02.863
SO, IF SHE WAS THAT
PAIN-IN-THE-ASS CLIENT,

38:02.947 --> 38:04.782
YOU HAD TO PUT ON
THE EXTRA CHARM PANTS.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.325
KISS HER ASS, BUT GET HER
COMFORTABLE WITH YOU.

38:06.409 --> 38:10.037
- I WAS IN SUCH A PEACEFUL
AND COMPLACENT MOOD.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.622
- YOUR HAND WAS TREMBLING.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.875
- I REALLY FEEL I DID
THE ABSOLUTE BEST THAT I COULD.

38:14.959 --> 38:15.751
- YOU WERE THE ONE THAT SAID,

38:15.835 --> 38:17.628
"MAYBE I'M NOT THE TATTOOER
FOR YOU."

38:17.712 --> 38:19.422
AT THAT POINT,
YOU LET HER WALK.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.506
- SHE LOOKED AT ME
AND DIDN'T LIKE ME.

38:20.589 --> 38:24.051
- YOU THEN HAD A LUXURY
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAD.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.388
YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO TATTOO
THE PERFECT CLIENT, YOURSELF.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.598
AND NO ONE'S GONNA TELL YOU
HOW TO DO IT.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.809
- I DISAGREE.
- OR WHAT TO PUT IN THERE.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.060
NO ONE ELSE HAD THAT LUXURY.
- I WASN'T GONNA--

38:33.144 --> 38:34.437
- YOU THEN HAD
THE EASIEST CUSTOMER.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.398
- I WASN'T GONNA LET HER AFFECT
THE REST OF MY LIFE,

38:37.481 --> 38:39.191
TO PUT SOMETHING ON MY LEG
THAT I DIDN'T WANT.

38:39.275 --> 38:43.279
- YOU GUYS ARE TRYING
TO WIN $100,000.

38:43.362 --> 38:47.074
AND OF ANY SITUATION I WOULD
EVER TATTOO MYSELF IN,

38:47.158 --> 38:48.284
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.703
- SOMETHING TINY.
JUST TO PUT SOMETHING IN.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.955
- 'CAUSE OTHERWISE YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO SHOW FOR.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.331
- AND AT THE END OF THIS

38:54.415 --> 38:56.459
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING
TO LOOK AT.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.002
- THE ONLY FAIR THING
THAT WE CAN REALLY DO

38:58.085 --> 39:01.172
IS LOOK AT YOUR PAST WORK--

39:01.255 --> 39:04.133
THE GARTER FROM YESTERDAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE.

39:04.216 --> 39:07.344
- THE QUALITY OF THIS TATTOOING
IS TOTALLY, TOTALLY OFF.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.433
- IS THERE ANYONE
THAT CAN TELL ME THIS TATTOO

39:12.516 --> 39:14.977
IS NOT JACKED?
- NO, I AGREE.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.437
I'M NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.563
- THERE'S NO PART OF THIS TATTOO

39:17.646 --> 39:18.481
THAT'S NOT JACKED.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.107
- I DESERVE TO [bleep] BE HERE.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.942
- NOT FROM THIS.
- NOT FROM THAT TATTOO.

39:22.026 --> 39:22.943
- IF MADDIE COULD OUTLINE, YOU
WOULD HAVE BEEN GONE YESTERDAY

39:23.027 --> 39:25.071
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.238
- I COULD GIVE
A MILLION DIFFERENT EXCUSES

39:26.322 --> 39:27.364
WHY IT WENT DOWN THE WAY IT DID,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.117
- JAMES, HOLD UP.
WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANYMORE.

39:34.038 --> 39:36.373
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.086
- [silently] WOW.

39:40.169 --> 39:44.799
- JAMES, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.467
- HAD YOU HAVE WON
AN ELIMINATION,

39:46.550 --> 39:48.844
THEN WE OBVIOUSLY
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LAUNCH YOU.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.971
- I WAS PLAYING IT SAFE
IN THE MIDDLE THE FIRST TWO.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.015
- THAT DOESN'T WORK HERE.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.809
YOU GOT TO CHARGE IT
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.561
YOU GOT TO GO AFTER IT AND TRY
TO PULL A "W."

39:57.645 --> 40:00.523
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.737
- THE JUDGES KEEP SAYING,
BEING INK MASTER,

40:06.821 --> 40:09.115
PART OF THAT IS BEING ABLE
TO DEAL WITH PROBLEM CLIENTS.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.492
NO, IT'S [bleep] NOT.

40:11.575 --> 40:15.871
I DON'T TATTOO
PROBLEM CLIENTS.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.998
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.008
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:28.092 --> 40:30.219
- YOU MUST ASSEMBLE
YOUR TATTOO MACHINE

40:30.302 --> 40:32.555
AND USE IT.
- [bleep].

40:32.638 --> 40:34.807
- I CAN'T DO IT
WITH THESE NAILS.

40:36.600 --> 40:37.810
- I'M MAKING POOR DECISIONS.

40:37.893 --> 40:39.353
- I CAN'T GET MY HEAD
OUT OF MY ASS.

40:39.436 --> 40:41.272
- I'M OFF MY GAME
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.523
- SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, JIME,
IS THAT I SHOULD

40:42.606 --> 40:44.817
HAVE SAID, "HERE, THIS GUY'S
AWESOME AT NEW SCHOOL.

40:44.900 --> 40:45.860
LET ME HOOK HIM UP."

40:45.943 --> 40:47.611
- JOSH JUST NEEDS
TO SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.864
DUDE, YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,
A DICKHEAD.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.740
- I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THIS TATTOO.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.908
- I DREW THIS GODDAMN THING.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.952
- IT LOOKS
LIKE A TOTAL MALFUNCTION.
