02:56.600 --> 03:00.100
Hurry up. Put it on the back.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.700
Lift the bloody thing, man.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.400
You wanna go work
with the women?

03:07.700 --> 03:08.800
Yeah.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.500
The violence
has continued unabated.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.100
Vigilante factions have taken law
into their own hands.

03:45.900 --> 03:49.100
The government
is asking for restraint.

03:49.300 --> 03:54.300
That's the end of the news headlines.
Our next bulletin will be at 8 p.m.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.899
- How is he?
- Oh, not good.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.200
He's not gonna make it.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You sort it out.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.100
And when you've finished...

04:35.200 --> 04:37.900
...can you park the Landie
at the tree there by the house?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.700
Okay.

05:02.300 --> 05:06.500
They say that the condition
for a great miracle is impossibility.

05:06.700 --> 05:11.200
But nothing on earth could help me
keep my farm in Zambia.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But I was left with no choice.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.400
The war, the lack of education
for our children...

05:17.600 --> 05:20.000
...and an uncertain future
for white farmers...

05:20.200 --> 05:22.200
...had left me with no option.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.600
Well, then I'd rather sell the farm.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.800
We're getting worse
than the bush war in Zimbabwe.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.600
I can't believe...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.900
...we're even considering this.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.300
We belong here.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.900
We built this place up.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.200
We'll start again together.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.300
We'll find
another farm somewhere...

06:04.500 --> 06:07.300
...where the kids can go to school
from home.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.200
I'm not sending my kids
to a boarding school in Zambia.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.900
The farmers in South Africa
seem to be doing well.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.800
God will give us a farm.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.400
And the stuff at the bank?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.700
Yeah, well, it's as sorted
as they'll ever be in Zambia.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.500
We're gonna have to smuggle in
some dollars.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.500
Is that wise?

07:04.100 --> 07:06.600
Angus, is that wise?

07:07.000 --> 07:09.400
Yeah, well, we have to do it.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.900
Bloody idiot, man,
look where you're going.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.800
Angus, don't. Stop it.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.100
Stupid man. Now we really
have to leave Zambia, and quick.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.000
Dad, what other things
can we take?

08:05.100 --> 08:09.200
Anything we can fit in.
Put it in the back.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.900
We got such a bad price
for the farm.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.800
But at least we've got
each other and the kids.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.200
I'll make it work.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.300
I know you will.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.600
We'll miss you.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.200
Well, we can't afford
a sugar-cane farm or anything fancy...

09:07.400 --> 09:11.500
...but welcome to our new home.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.700
What are we gonna farm here?

09:17.600 --> 09:21.600
Beans and maize, cattle.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.400
And water?

09:29.300 --> 09:30.400
What about water?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.400
Where's our house?

09:38.200 --> 09:41.700
Our house has wheels on it.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.700
We're like gypsies now.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.300
Gypsies in the Garden of Eden.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.600
It's gonna stand right here.

09:50.300 --> 09:52.500
What are we gonna call
our new home?

09:58.400 --> 10:00.000
"Shalom."

10:01.000 --> 10:02.600
Shalom?

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
Why Shalom?

10:05.500 --> 10:07.400
It means "peace."

10:09.300 --> 10:10.900
Peace.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.600
No, man. Come on, man.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.300
I said the stump,
not the bloody rope, man.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.400
You bloody idiot, man! Come on,
man, have you got no brains?

10:46.500 --> 10:48.700
Hamba, man. Get off my farm.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.100
What have I done?

10:50.200 --> 10:51.300
You are mad.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.600
I need men with brains.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.100
With some sense in their heads.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.800
Bloody idiot.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.000
Was that necessary?
He just wanted to help.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.100
I didn't like the look of him.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.100
These Zulus are devious.
I don't understand what they're saying.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.300
We need the help.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.800
If the right men come along,
I'll knock some sense into them.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.400
In the meantime,
I'll do everything myself.

11:15.500 --> 11:19.300
I'll build this place up alone.
I can do it if I have to.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.500
I don't need anybody.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.900
- Love, be sensible.
- No, Jill.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.700
I'll make this work my way,
like I've done before.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.800
Andy, come now.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.300
Come on, get in the car.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.200
Move back... move back...
Hit!

11:34.400 --> 11:37.100
Hey, boys, hit, man!

11:38.100 --> 11:39.100
Hey, these boys...

11:39.300 --> 11:40.600
...there we go.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.700
This is it!

11:46.200 --> 11:47.700
Thank you, girl.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.700
Hey, Isaiah...

12:01.400 --> 12:05.400
There's a new white man
at the Dixon place.

12:06.300 --> 12:13.000
We must go see
if he can give us some work.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.900
This is it!
These boys...

12:17.100 --> 12:21.000
Hey, boys, be firm!
Go down, go down!

12:29.900 --> 12:32.500
I'll get you out, you cursed stump.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.800
The kids seem to be happy
in their new school.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.400
And there's a polocrosse club
in the neighborhood.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.100
You should go
and meet some people.

12:54.300 --> 12:57.500
- Stating that there would be
suspicious characters around.

12:57.600 --> 13:02.800
In fact, these are the police
that are being sent to patrol the area.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.300
Another white farmer was shot
and killed at the weekend...

13:06.500 --> 13:08.800
...near Greytown
in the Natal Midlands.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.000
The farmhouse was ransacked...

13:11.200 --> 13:15.100
...and the farmer's wife and children
and two of the farmer's workers...

13:15.300 --> 13:17.800
...were assaulted and tied up.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.800
This is the second attack
on farmers...

13:20.000 --> 13:23.900
I hope we did the right thing.
Maybe we should just move to town.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.800
I can sell the tractors or something.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.700
People get robbed and hijacked
in towns in this country too, love.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.400
We'll pray that God protects us.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.200
You pray.
Why should God listen to me?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.400
I'm asking if you have
some work for me?

14:15.500 --> 14:16.600
Do you speak English?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.600
Fanagalo?

14:20.200 --> 14:23.100
No, I only speak Zulu, sir.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.300
I will do a good job.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.600
I know farm work.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.800
Well, can you drive one of those?

14:36.600 --> 14:38.700
So, what can you do, man?

14:59.900 --> 15:00.900
Hi there.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.200
I'm Koos Smit.
Welcome to Greytown.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.300
Name's Buchan, Angus Buchan.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.800
Do you play?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.600
Yeah, I've played before.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.200
Well, you can practice with us,
but don't get hurt.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.000
I don't want your wife on my back.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.500
We like to play rough,
us policemen.

15:16.700 --> 15:20.100
And the farmers,
they really give it stick.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.000
But if you wanna play,
there's some gear in the clubhouse.

15:23.100 --> 15:26.200
And Jonah will sort you out
with a pony. See you.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.800
Hey, boet, it's not too late
to change your mind, all right?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
It's okay.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.200
If you don't have the guts
to play with us...

15:33.400 --> 15:35.800
...you can play bowls
with the old people in town.

15:41.100 --> 15:44.100
Horses on up. Pawn.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.900
Right towards you.

16:29.700 --> 16:30.900
Come on. Go.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.700
The green mamba.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.600
Hey, Angus.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.600
You, my boet,
have five seconds flat.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.000
Starting now. Five...

16:55.100 --> 16:56.600
- Five, four, three, two...
- Five.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.600
- Four, three, two, one, zero.
- One.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.300
Hey. Not bad for an Englishman.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.800
Hey, I'm a Scotsman.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.900
Welcome to Greytown, boet.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.300
Meet Percy Hawkins,
a sugar-cane farmer.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.599
Hello, Angus.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.099
Let me give you some good advice,
old boy.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.900
You're gonna need eyes in the back
of your head at Dixon's old farm.

17:17.099 --> 17:20.800
You probably heard the news that
our Zulus are a treacherous bunch.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.400
I'd watch my back if I were you.

17:24.300 --> 17:28.400
Hey, you've heard the news.
It's a bloody war out there.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.900
Gotta have good firepower.
I carry mine every day.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.400
Don't take any nonsense
from these natives, old boy.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.800
You've gotta show them who's boss,
simple as that. They respect that.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.200
It's bloody, absolutely bloody.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.500
That's the way it's done, though.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.100
It's no different in Zambia.

18:01.900 --> 18:02.900
What's that?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.800
No, Nkosana, you can't live
in a toy house, it's not right.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.100
No, man, slower, man. Slower.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.900
I know very little Zulu.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.200
Don't speak too fast.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.800
I can show you how to build a house.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.300
The little tin house on wheels...

18:19.500 --> 18:22.500
...it's not good for your family.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.900
I think he wants us to build a house.
He's madder than I thought.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.500
Greetings, brother

18:30.700 --> 18:31.700
Greetings.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.100
Hi. I'm Steyn.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.200
You must be Angus and Jill. Hi.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.100
Ja, we heard you guys moved in.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.000
I'm the farm manager
just here across the river.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
It's good to meet you, Steyn.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.500
Do you speak Zulu?
I only know a few words.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.200
Ja, I can speak Zulu.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.100
I think he wants us to build a house,
but...

18:52.300 --> 18:54.700
Can you tell him that we've gotta do
other work today?

18:54.900 --> 18:56.900
When I've got money
after the first crop...

18:57.000 --> 18:59.600
...then I'll get a proper builder
to do it.

18:59.800 --> 19:04.300
Nkosana thinks that it will take...

19:05.900 --> 19:09.000
...a long time... to build a house.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.300
He says... he'll get a builder to do it.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.900
No, no, tell him not to worry.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.700
I'm a strong man.

19:17.900 --> 19:23.100
I've got other strong men
and women who can help us.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.300
We'll build a beautiful house
in a few weeks.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.400
Angus, you know,
these guys, I've seen them.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.800
They build their own huts
within a week.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.800
They use natural materials.
They're very skilled at this.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.100
He says that if you help him...

19:38.300 --> 19:41.500
...he could build you a nice place
within three weeks.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.700
Okay.
Tell him I'll think about it tonight.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.500
But today we're gonna clear
more wattle to make room for planting.

19:48.700 --> 19:51.300
Come, Steyn,
come join us for some coffee.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.500
There you go.

20:04.900 --> 20:09.300
This is my old friend Isaiah.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.700
He's come here to help me.

20:12.900 --> 20:16.400
He also wants to work here
with us on the farm.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.500
Good day, Nkosana.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.800
Let me help you, Nkosana.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.800
Simeon says
there is much to do on the farm.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.000
Do you drive a tractor?

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
Yes, Nkosana, I can drive a tractor.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
Okay, come and help me inside.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.900
Since when can you drive a tractor?

20:37.700 --> 20:40.100
He's a crazy white man.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.200
He behaves like one of those mad
Italians working on the power lines.

20:44.300 --> 20:49.300
He waves his hands about all the time,
speaking nonsense.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.500
You know what I've done?

20:51.700 --> 20:54.200
I've named him Nkosaan Italiaan!

21:05.600 --> 21:08.400
Today we're gonna finish this.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.500
And tomorrow, we'll try and get
a contract for seed maize...

21:11.700 --> 21:14.100
...for cattle, and we can start...

21:14.200 --> 21:16.400
Angus, take a break.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.900
Love, we've done so much already.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.700
We've found water,
we've found land.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.100
We've built, or nearly built a house.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.900
Just take a break.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.300
What do you think you're doing?

21:59.200 --> 22:03.900
Well, you lot,
welcome to the Buchan mansion.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.200
My beautiful little nephew.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.600
Joanne, it's great
to have you and Fergus here.

22:32.700 --> 22:36.800
It's really good for Angus
to have his brother around, really.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.800
And apart from polocrosse,
he just works.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.600
The farm attacks don't help either.

22:47.800 --> 22:52.200
And you know what he's like
when his blood's up.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.900
Ladies, the water's ready.

22:59.100 --> 23:01.500
He needs help, Joanne.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.000
He needs help.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.700
He's strung out
like a tight guitar string all the time.

23:10.900 --> 23:13.400
And I'm just waiting for the snap.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
All I can do is love him.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.200
A friend of Fergus'
was in the same way...

23:20.300 --> 23:23.000
...and the doctor put him
on some tranquilizers.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
It has helped.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.500
The pills detach you
from your problems.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.000
Maybe Angus need a little help
for a while...

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
...just to get him through.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.700
Why don't you plant potatoes?
They say there's good money in it.

23:36.900 --> 23:40.200
Hey, man, planting potatoes
is a very expensive exercise.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.500
Aside from getting the seed potatoes,
you need a ton of fertilizer per hectare.

23:44.700 --> 23:47.100
With mealies,
you put down less than half as much.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.400
What, three, 400 kilos, eh?

23:49.500 --> 23:52.200
It's something like that,
but that's not what bothers me...

23:52.400 --> 23:55.400
...it's the water
and the spray program.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.700
It's expensive,
and we don't have the water.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.900
What for, blight?

24:00.100 --> 24:01.200
Exactly, man.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
- The spray is about 6000 rand.
- Ja, something like that, 6000.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.700
Let me get that for you, Jilly.

24:06.900 --> 24:10.400
Nobody plants potatoes here
unless they've got a lot of water.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.400
If you don't get enough rain,
you can kiss your farm goodbye.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.000
- Thanks.
- Who wanted the coffee?

24:15.200 --> 24:16.400
Right here, Jilly.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.500
Chickens, broiler chickens.
Now that's the future.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.000
Ja, people love chicken.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.400
Alistair, look here.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.300
Alistair.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.200
Ja, that's right.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.200
That's it.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.900
That's it.

24:38.100 --> 24:41.800
Auntie Angus,
please can you come and play?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.800
We'll play later, okay?
I'm just having some coffee now.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.400
Alistair calls me Auntie Angus.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Hey. What's wrong?

25:06.400 --> 25:08.000
What's wrong?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.800
There's a big problem.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.300
What big problem?

25:17.200 --> 25:18.200
Speak up, Bhengu!

25:19.400 --> 25:21.200
There's a big accident.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.500
Well, show me.

25:49.100 --> 25:52.100
What the heck happened here?

25:52.300 --> 25:55.800
No. No, no, no, man!

25:56.000 --> 25:58.300
What happened here?
What have you done, man?

25:58.400 --> 26:00.400
Nkosana, I let... Simeon drive...

26:00.600 --> 26:04.000
No, no... you're not putting it right!

26:04.100 --> 26:06.400
I expressly said
you don't drive this tractor.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.100
How many times must I tell you?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.300
I let you drive...

26:09.500 --> 26:11.100
How am I supposed
to farm with this?

26:11.300 --> 26:12.700
You're supposed to be my induna.

26:12.900 --> 26:15.800
You'd better run. I'm gonna kill you.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.200
Never come back!

26:21.800 --> 26:24.100
Come back!

26:24.300 --> 26:25.300
It's fine.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.200
Come back.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.400
I'll think of something. We'll fix this.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.200
How am I supposed
to farm with this?

26:41.700 --> 26:43.700
Bloody idiots.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.500
I'm gonna kill you.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.700
You're gonna have to help me
every night.

26:55.900 --> 26:56.900
After work.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.000
I don't have money for a mechanic.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.400
We're gonna do this ourselves.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.000
You are gonna have to help me
fix what you've broken.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.100
For no extra pay.
Do you understand?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.200
It's right, Nkosana. We will do that.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.600
You're right.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.600
Shoot, man.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.800
Sorry, Koos.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.000
I'm falling apart.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.900
What you need, boet,
is a shot of whiskey...

27:40.100 --> 27:42.800
...a Benzol and your bed.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.000
Oh, Koos, it's hectic.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.000
I've never been like this before.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.700
I work every day...

27:56.600 --> 28:00.200
...18 hours a day on most days.

28:00.400 --> 28:02.100
I'm stressed.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.000
I...

28:09.000 --> 28:11.600
I feel ready for the funny farm.

28:11.700 --> 28:15.100
I make those pit bosses
on the farm work just as hard as I do.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.400
You know what amazes me?
They keep up to my pace.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.700
My induna, Simeon...

28:25.600 --> 28:27.500
...what a beauty.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.000
That's one tough Zulu there.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.000
When last did you have a holiday?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.200
What's that?

28:32.400 --> 28:35.200
Jill's even got me
some tranquilizers.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And are you gonna take them?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.900
I don't know, man.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.400
Those things are for fruitcakes.

28:48.500 --> 28:52.000
I'm a pussycat.
But I'm not a bloody fruitcake.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.600
Well, if it isn't
Mandela's little policeman...

28:55.800 --> 28:59.800
...and the manic Zambian
in a conversation about psychiatry.

29:01.400 --> 29:04.500
Is your John Deere fixed yet,
Buchy?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.900
Get lost, Percy.

29:07.300 --> 29:10.200
I would've beaten the life
out of those idiots, and fired them.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.700
They won't respect you now.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.400
Bull, Percy.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.800
Keeping the peace is the best security
for our farmers.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.200
I mean, you know what happened to
Engelbrecht a couple of months ago.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.700
The man had two kids
with a Zulu worker.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.900
Wouldn't have
anything to do with them.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.900
And on top of that,
he refused to pay lobola.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.000
Let me tell you something, Percy.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.900
If there's one nation
that knows how to retaliate...

29:35.000 --> 29:36.700
...it's the Zulus.

29:36.900 --> 29:40.600
These guys have been fighting
blood feuds for generations.

29:40.800 --> 29:42.900
And if they can kill
each other today...

29:43.100 --> 29:47.000
...for cattle that was supposedly stolen
over a hundred years ago...

29:47.100 --> 29:48.800
...what chance do you have?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
No, boet.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.700
Respect the law,
but above all, respect the people.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.200
And I thought you Afrikaner cops
knew better than that.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.400
Let me tell you something, Koos,
and you'd better listen carefully.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.900
The most dangerous job in the world
is being a farmer in South Africa.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.900
You know,
I read in the Farmer's Weekly...

30:07.100 --> 30:10.200
...that more than 1600 farmers
have been murdered...

30:10.400 --> 30:11.600
...in 8000 farm attacks.

30:11.700 --> 30:14.900
One thousand, six hundred.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.800
And some of those were my friends.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.800
So that is what
your so-called freedom brings.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.300
Those were my favorite pants,
you twit.

30:29.500 --> 30:32.600
So if that is what
your so-called freedom brings...

30:33.300 --> 30:37.600
...you'd better recognize
the place and times.

30:37.700 --> 30:41.400
Not me, boykie.
I'm not going down without a fight.

30:43.900 --> 30:45.500
We're doing okay here, love.

30:45.700 --> 30:49.000
One or two big crops,
and we'll pay off our debts.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.000
Now, stop it, Jill.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.800
I'm sorry.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.100
It feels like I'm getting nowhere.
I'm trying my best.

31:06.300 --> 31:09.400
But it's just work, work, work,
and I can't stop, Jill. I hate it.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.400
I know, Angus,
but it's hard on me too.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.500
But it feels like
everything's on my shoulders.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.600
I can't go on like this.

31:17.700 --> 31:20.300
I want my husband back.

31:20.500 --> 31:23.200
Just take the pills.
Just do something.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.100
Okay, I'll try them.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.700
I'll take these stupid pills.

31:29.100 --> 31:30.900
This is how you want
your husband back?

31:31.100 --> 31:32.600
With his head full of pills?

31:32.800 --> 31:36.400
Maybe I should go and smoke
some dagga with the Zulus in town.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
Please come back.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.200
Come, Andy. Come, boy.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.600
Come, come. Have a good day.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.600
Have you got everything?

32:06.800 --> 32:07.800
Come. Cheers, Andy.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.300
Don't forget your homework. Okay.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.900
Okay, come.

32:12.100 --> 32:14.800
Jill, how's it going at the farm?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.900
Hi, Dawn. Well, thanks.

32:18.300 --> 32:19.800
Things are well. Thank you.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.600
And how's Angus doing?

32:27.900 --> 32:29.700
Oh, you know...

32:31.600 --> 32:33.500
He's okay.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.400
We're at peace.
We're good, we're okay.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.000
Do you have time for a cup of tea?

32:42.800 --> 32:45.100
It's difficult. It's very difficult.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.500
It's a lot of stress.

32:47.700 --> 32:53.700
And Angus, I worry about him.

32:55.700 --> 32:58.300
The pressure's just, you know...

33:01.700 --> 33:03.900
I thought tranquilizers would help,
but they...

33:09.200 --> 33:15.100
And I wanna help,
but we've lost touch.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.400
We just...

33:22.800 --> 33:26.700
The local Methodist church is having
a missions breakfast on Saturday.

33:26.900 --> 33:27.900
It's a lot of fun.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.900
Why don't you guys come along
and meet a few new friends?

34:40.500 --> 34:41.900
Got you, fat hog.

34:42.100 --> 34:44.699
You've been eating my corn
for far too long.

34:48.300 --> 34:50.000
Where's my horse?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.400
Out now. Wait for us in the car.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.100
- Dad, we're so late.
- We need to go, Daddy.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.500
Daddy will be done now.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.800
I'm not wearing this stupid tie.
I look bloody ridiculous.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.900
You look fine, love.
Come, let me help you.

35:09.400 --> 35:10.800
You know what? I'm not going.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.300
You take the kids. I'm staying.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.300
I'm not going without you, Angus.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.200
Please.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.300
You go. I'm not the type for church.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.000
You don't have to wear the stupid tie.
Go without one.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.600
- Please come.
- I'm staying, Jill.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.900
Angus, please. We need this.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.200
Jill, just stop hassling me
about the tie.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.200
You're lucky I've come
to this stupid meeting.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.800
Don't hush me.

36:05.900 --> 36:07.300
Come on.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.000
- Want me to bring the carry cot?
- No, love.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.200
Come, boy. Let's go.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.800
Right, thank you, everybody.
Good morning.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.300
Beautiful day today, isn't it?

37:17.700 --> 37:20.200
I'd like to start off
reading Psalm 100.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.100
Why don't you come
to church tomorrow?

37:22.200 --> 37:24.800
Local farmers
are gonna be speaking.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.500
Make a joyful shout to the Lord,
all ye lands.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.700
Serve the Lord with gladness.

37:29.900 --> 37:32.400
Come before his presence
with singing.

37:32.500 --> 37:35.100
Know that the Lord, he is God.

37:35.300 --> 37:39.700
Know that it is he who has made us,
and that we...

38:01.500 --> 38:02.500
Jill, there's no space.

38:02.700 --> 38:05.100
Come on, let's go.
There's no space.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.500
Jill, not the front row.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.700
That's when I put my hand
in front of my mouth.

38:42.300 --> 38:47.200
I didn't want them to smell my breath,
because I was a little bit drunk.

38:50.900 --> 38:53.500
But then the gentle guy asked:

38:54.300 --> 38:56.800
"What about you?"

38:59.300 --> 39:01.500
I was cut to the heart.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.400
My life was a mess.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.100
I had nowhere to go to.

39:11.700 --> 39:14.100
I had no interest in religion.

39:15.700 --> 39:20.000
My heart cried out for reality.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.100
Hey, Angus. Come here.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.900
Hey, Angus.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.700
Hey, Angus.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.200
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen, kids.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.600
Thanks for coming
to tonight's show.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.000
When you watch a show like that...

40:01.700 --> 40:06.400
...it just shows us there's an emptiness
in the hearts of all people.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.700
An emptiness that nothing
but the Lord himself...

40:11.400 --> 40:13.100
For God so loved the world...

40:14.400 --> 40:16.900
...that he gave his only son...

40:18.100 --> 40:20.000
...so that whoever...

40:20.600 --> 40:26.100
And that means,
whoever believes in him...

40:26.500 --> 40:32.000
...will not die,
but will have everlasting life.

40:32.600 --> 40:37.200
And no one can deny the reality
of the testimony of Jesus Christ...

40:37.400 --> 40:39.200
...in these men's lives.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.700
Ordinary farmer folk
from this district.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.800
If you want that relationship
with Jesus Christ...

40:47.000 --> 40:49.500
...you can have it right now.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
Like these guys,
you can invite Jesus into your life...

40:55.300 --> 40:58.100
...and we invite you now
to come forward.

40:58.200 --> 41:02.400
Receive Jesus Christ today
and let him change your life.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.300
Come forward.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.600
Give your life to Jesus.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.900
Let him change you.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.800
Give him an opportunity.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.600
That's right.

41:21.700 --> 41:24.200
You'll never be the same again.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.000
My dad is a Scotsman.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.000
He moved from Aberdeenshire
to Zambia...

42:22.200 --> 42:23.900
...and then he started farming there.

42:24.100 --> 42:28.000
And like him,
I'm a little bit stubborn and crazy.

42:28.200 --> 42:30.200
Like the Scotsmen gave it
to the English.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.700
Lifting their kilts
and shouting obscenities in battle.

42:33.900 --> 42:36.300
It's in my blood and I feel it.

42:36.900 --> 42:39.600
Now, some people think
I'm a wild farmer...

42:39.800 --> 42:43.600
...but I'm proud of my roots
and I'm still gonna go to Scotland.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.700
Hey, I'm a Scottish-African.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.500
Talk about a crazy combination.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.100
Angus.

42:51.300 --> 42:55.400
Well, God loves wild men
who are excited about him, Angus.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.000
He put that wildness in you.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.900
He put that wildness in you
because he loves you.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.100
He loves you. He's crazy about you.

43:03.300 --> 43:08.200
It makes me think of David,
dancing naked before the Lord.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.900
Actually, not naked.
He was in his jocks.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.300
I'm...

43:12.700 --> 43:15.900
And I wanna give you something.
I've got a little Bible around here.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.900
Or Paul and the disciples.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.000
They turned villages around.

43:20.200 --> 43:23.200
The world upside down,
it says in the Bible.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.000
Crazy men.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.400
But holy.

43:28.800 --> 43:31.200
You know, I...

43:31.600 --> 43:33.900
I have this urgency in me.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.900
I feel it in my heart now.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.400
I really wanna know God.

43:39.800 --> 43:45.700
And I wanna know
why he knows me, and...

43:47.100 --> 43:50.200
I don't know, what can I do?
Is there something I can do?

43:50.400 --> 43:53.000
That's God's spirit in you.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.300
Tell you what.

43:55.800 --> 43:59.100
You tell the first three friends
you see today what you did.

43:59.300 --> 44:02.100
Tell them
you gave your life to Jesus.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.400
Now, that's a challenge.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.800
They'll think I'm a nutter.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.100
Just do it.

44:12.300 --> 44:16.000
This is the little Bible somebody
gave me a long, long time ago.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.600
You'll like it.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.100
Cheerio, I just have to go
to the bank to draw some money...

44:28.300 --> 44:30.600
...but I'll be coming back
this afternoon.

44:40.800 --> 44:41.900
Hey, Angus.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.700
Angus.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.800
What's up, boet?

44:47.900 --> 44:50.400
You look like death warmed up.

44:52.700 --> 44:54.300
What's wrong?

44:54.500 --> 44:57.300
You haven't been taking
those happy pills, have you?

44:57.500 --> 45:01.100
No, Koos,
there's something I gotta tell you.

45:01.300 --> 45:03.400
Well, you're in luck.
Koos is off duty.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.300
I'll buy the drinks, you do the talking,
okay?

45:16.200 --> 45:19.500
Hey, Buchy,
don't look so dang serious, man.

45:20.200 --> 45:23.200
You look like the Springboks just lost
against the All Blacks...

45:23.300 --> 45:25.900
...or even worse,
against the English.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.500
Okay, boet, shoot.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.900
I made a decision yesterday...

45:37.100 --> 45:39.900
...to give my whole life,
my family and my farm to Jesus.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.300
Bliksem, Buchy.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.400
You almost had me there
for a second or two.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.300
You shouldn't joke
about those things.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.900
No, Koos, really, I'm being serious.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.100
It's like God took me by the throat
and shook me until I listened.

46:00.900 --> 46:03.300
You're not gonna turn all weird
on me now, are you?

46:07.400 --> 46:09.700
Another one bites the dust.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.900
There's a breeze... eh...

46:27.800 --> 46:31.100
There's a breeze...

46:32.700 --> 46:35.200
- You mean a little bit?
- Yes.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.000
- You mean a small bit?
- A little bit.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.900
There's a bit of breeze
but we should be fine.

46:40.100 --> 46:42.600
Yes! You got it!

46:47.000 --> 46:50.400
Yes, the grass,
the bushes are a little green still.

46:50.500 --> 46:53.200
It will not burn too fast.

47:09.900 --> 47:12.800
Hey, Simeon,
what do you know about Jesus?

47:13.000 --> 47:14.400
No, wait a minute.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.700
Do you know him?

47:15.900 --> 47:19.000
All I know is that
he's the white man's God.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.200
No, man.
What do you know about him?

47:22.700 --> 47:26.700
The women go to his church
on Sundays...

47:26.900 --> 47:30.200
...and us men drink and sleep.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.900
We've done enough on that side.
We can start...

47:42.900 --> 47:45.000
No. Hey.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.900
Call the others!

47:47.300 --> 47:48.700
Quickly, quickly.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.600
I have to get help!

48:11.700 --> 48:13.600
Jill. Jill.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.200
Call the farmers. We need help.

48:16.300 --> 48:19.000
We've got a runaway fire.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Angus, are you okay?

49:11.200 --> 49:13.900
- Angus?
- I'm burnt.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.200
Listen up.
I've got to go back into town, man.

49:16.300 --> 49:19.700
- Let me get the doctor.
- No, we've gotta put the fire out first.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.100
Okay. Where can I help?

49:21.200 --> 49:23.300
Start here.
The Lion Match plantation.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.700
They'll sue me. Get it, get it out.

49:29.100 --> 49:30.800
Simeon!

49:31.000 --> 49:32.500
Simeon.

49:32.700 --> 49:34.000
Simeon, we have to...

49:34.600 --> 49:36.800
...keep the fire away from...

49:37.400 --> 49:39.100
...Lion Match's trees!

49:59.200 --> 50:00.500
You can stay there.

50:07.600 --> 50:10.100
What things soever you desire,
when you pray...

50:10.300 --> 50:13.000
...believe that you receive them,
and you shall have them.

50:13.100 --> 50:16.400
What things soever you desire,
when you pray...

50:16.500 --> 50:20.000
...believe that you shall receive them,
and you shall have them.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.000
Simeon.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.000
We must pray for rain now!

50:26.700 --> 50:28.900
There will be no rain.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.500
The rain season is not here yet.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.600
We must pray for rain now!

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
There will be no rain!

50:39.000 --> 50:40.800
The rain season is not here yet.

50:48.700 --> 50:50.800
Jesus. God, please.

51:31.800 --> 51:33.700
Simeon.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.200
Rain!

51:36.000 --> 51:37.200
Rain!

51:42.000 --> 51:44.600
Rain!

52:06.300 --> 52:08.000
Thank you, Jesus!

52:08.800 --> 52:10.500
Thank you, God!

52:58.500 --> 53:00.700
How do I do this, Lord?

53:03.200 --> 53:05.300
How must I speak to people?

53:11.000 --> 53:12.800
Tell them what's in my heart?

53:13.000 --> 53:14.800
What you've done?

53:17.400 --> 53:20.300
You make me lie down
in green pastures.

53:21.500 --> 53:23.800
You still my soul.

53:35.400 --> 53:37.100
Angus?

53:40.000 --> 53:41.800
Angus.

53:43.700 --> 53:44.900
Rev.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.600
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:47.700 --> 53:50.000
- How are you?
- Great.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.900
- And you?
- Nice to see you, good.

53:52.100 --> 53:54.600
Well, welcome to my church.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.800
- Impressive.
- It's my green cathedral.

53:58.200 --> 54:00.500
God spoke to me in there.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.000
He said, "Just trust me."

54:03.700 --> 54:05.000
And I've seen some miracles.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.700
I know. I heard.

54:06.800 --> 54:09.000
- The fire breaks.
- Yeah.

54:09.600 --> 54:12.600
- That's great.
- I've gotta tell people, Reverend.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.700
Something's changed in my heart.

54:15.900 --> 54:17.800
I've changed.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.600
Surely, there's gotta be
people out there just like me.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.700
How I used to be.

54:23.900 --> 54:24.900
Despairing.

54:25.100 --> 54:27.900
Working their heads off every day.

54:28.100 --> 54:29.700
- For what?
- Yeah.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.200
You're right.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.100
Another thing,
when I was in there was...

54:35.700 --> 54:38.600
It just struck me
that God used ordinary people.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.700
Everyday people.

54:40.900 --> 54:44.100
Doctors, farmers like me.
