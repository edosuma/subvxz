WITH PEOPLE WHO STINK.

THOSE BEERS IN THE FRIDGE.

WITH THREE SS.

NO PLANS THAT NIGHT.

AND, FOUR, I HAPPEN TO KNOW
SHE LOVES SPONTANEITY.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.784
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I CAN READ WOMEN.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.651
- AND SHE USED TO HAVE THAT
ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE.

03:46.690 --> 03:48.385

IT SHOULD BE.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.523

05:05.400 --> 05:06.765
- I'M STILL ANNOYED, GUS.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.835
- WHO CARES ABOUT THE QUESTION?

05:07.870 --> 05:09.861
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE WORKING
ON THE LORD'S DAY.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.366

05:11.410 --> 05:12.832
- SUNDAY IS THE LORD'S DAY,
SHAWN.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.701
LASSIE, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
PLAYING GOLF TODAY.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.378

05:17.410 --> 05:18.809
- JULES, WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:18.850 --> 05:21.341

70-YEAR-OLD FEMALE

05:21.380 --> 05:23.610
FOUND DEAD ON HER BLANKET AFTER
THE PHILHARMONIC LAST NIGHT,

05:23.650 --> 05:25.083
BUT SHE WASN'T DISCOVERED
UNTIL THIS MORNING.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.754
- I DO.
BOREDOM.

05:27.790 --> 05:28.916
- I LOVE THE PHILHARMONIC.

STEALING MY MOMENTS?

06:29.720 --> 06:30.744
- I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.814

06:31.850 --> 06:34.853
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT
THE AEROSOL CANS.

OF A CAN OF HAIRSPRAY.

06:39.630 --> 06:40.824

A SERIAL KILLER?

06:40.860 --> 06:43.863
- WELL, THE CONSISTENCIES
AT EACH SCENE

06:43.900 --> 06:45.697
COMBINED WITH THE CLOSE TIMING
OF THE DEATHS

06:45.730 --> 06:46.936
CERTAINLY MAKES IT
A POSSIBILITY.

06:46.970 --> 06:50.007
DEFINITELY RECOMMEND CHECKING
THE CONTENTS OF THOSE CANS.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.166

06:51.210 --> 06:52.199

06:52.240 --> 06:53.673
IT'S MY PLEASURE, DETECTIVE.

06:53.710 --> 06:58.875

06:58.910 --> 07:00.775
WHY DON'T I LIKE THIS GUY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.708
MAYBE 'CAUSE HE KEEPS
STEALING YOUR THUNDER.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.047
- BECAUSE HIS NAME IS "DECLAN."

07:04.090 --> 07:05.546
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
U'I'TERLY RIDICULOUS?

07:05.590 --> 07:06.784
- NO.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.787
- THAT'S BECAUSE
YOUR NAME'S "BURTON."

07:07.820 --> 07:08.912
- CAN WE GET OUT OF HERE?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.552
- NOT UNTIL I ASK JULES
TO BE MY DATE TO THE WEDDING.

07:10.590 --> 07:11.852
- NOW IS NOT THE TIME.
- WHY NOT?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.221
- WELL, FOR STARTERS,
THERE'S A DEAD BODY

07:13.260 --> 07:14.659

07:14.700 --> 07:15.724

07:17.270 --> 07:20.159

07:21.840 --> 07:25.105
- WELL, UH...

07:25.140 --> 07:26.732
I KNOW THIS IS TOTALLY
SHORT NOTICE,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.771
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF, UH, UH,

07:28.810 --> 07:33.577
YOU'D LIKE TO BE MY DATE TO
A FRIEND'S WEDDING ON SATURDAY?

07:33.620 --> 07:36.214
- ARE YOU ASKING ME OUT NEXT
TO A DEAD PERSON?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.478
- TOLD YOU.
- YES.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.489
BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OKAY,
SINCE IT DOESN'T REALLY SMELL.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.953
- SATURDAY?

07:41.990 --> 07:44.254
UH, I WOULD LOVE TO...
- FANTASTIC.

07:44.290 --> 07:47.157

PLANS WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

- OKAY, UM, WELL, WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER, YEAH?

08:02.780 --> 08:07.672
- YES, LATER.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.540
- HMM.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.717

OF THAT GUY'S JIB, GUS.

* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

08:41.780 --> 08:46.285
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

08:46.320 --> 08:50.780
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
BUT YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

08:50.830 --> 08:52.798
*

08:52.830 --> 08:54.092
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

08:54.130 --> 08:56.052
* THAT I'M NOT
TELLING THE TRUTH *

08:56.100 --> 08:57.692
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

08:57.730 --> 08:59.220
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

08:59.270 --> 09:00.828
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

09:00.870 --> 09:02.701
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

09:02.740 --> 09:04.139
* YOUR WORST INHIBITION'S

09:04.170 --> 09:06.775
* GONNA PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

09:06.810 --> 09:09.870
*

09:14.250 --> 09:15.808
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE GIVING DECLAN

09:15.850 --> 09:17.317
ALL THE CREDIT FOR COMING UP
WITH THE FACT

09:17.350 --> 09:18.908
THAT THERE WAS POISON
IN THOSE CANS

09:18.950 --> 09:20.656
WHEN YOU KNOW I HAD
THE EXACT SAME TAKE.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.157
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

09:22.190 --> 09:23.726
- BECAUSE HE BEAT ME
TO THE PUNCH, GUS.

09:23.760 --> 09:24.988
- JUST LIKE WITH JULIET
AND THE TRIVIA QUESTION.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.122
- YOU'RE A BIG, FAT PERSON.
- NO, I'M NOT.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.229
- I KNOW.

09:27.260 --> 09:27.954
I WAS TRYING TO GET YOU BACK
FOR MAKING ME FEEL BAD.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.367
- SHAWN, HEY.
- HEY, JULES!

09:31.400 --> 09:33.163
- WHY ARE YOU TALKING LIKE THAT?

09:33.200 --> 09:35.361
- SOMETIMES HE OVER-ENUNCIATES
WHEN HE GETS UNCOMFORTABLE.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.766
- I DO NOT.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.300
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

09:39.340 --> 09:42.070
- SURE.

09:42.110 --> 09:45.273
- UM, LISTEN,
ABOUT YESTERDAY,

09:45.310 --> 09:47.141
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT

09:47.180 --> 09:49.273
AND I BARELY KNOW DECLAN.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.788
I WILL RESCHEDULE WITH HIM
IF YOU REALLY NEED A DATE

09:51.820 --> 09:53.913
TO THIS WEDDING.
- [chuckles]

09:53.960 --> 09:56.622
NO, NO, JULES,
I DON'T NEED A DATE.

09:56.660 --> 09:58.127
I ONLY ASKED YOU THAT
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

09:58.160 --> 10:00.299
BE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO DO THIS WEEKEND, YOU KNOW?

10:00.330 --> 10:02.992
FINDING ANOTHER DATE WILL BE
NO PROBLEM, TRUST ME.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.089
- OH, GOOD.

10:05.130 --> 10:08.236
I'M GLAD.
- YEAH.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.965
[sighs]

10:10.010 --> 10:11.762
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

10:11.810 --> 10:14.028
- EVERY ILL-CONCEIVED WORD.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.707
- NOW I HAVE TO FIND
A DATE TO THIS THING.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.968
- YEAH, YOU DO.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.739
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.645
IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ALREADY,

10:20.680 --> 10:22.784
WE HAVE A POTENTIAL
SERIAL KILLER ON THE LOOSE

10:22.820 --> 10:25.983
WHO HAS POISONED THREE VICTIMS
WITHIN FIVE DAYS.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.419
NOW, YOUR DEPARTMENT HEADS
WILL BRIEF YOU

10:27.460 --> 10:30.122
ON THE SPECIFICS, BUT WHAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW

10:30.160 --> 10:33.652
IS THAT EVERY OFFICER HERE
IS ON THIS CASE.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.919
ALL PRECINCT RESOURCES WILL
BE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU,

10:36.970 --> 10:38.858
INCLUDING OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.788
- SPECIFICALLY WE'LL
BE BRINGING IN PSYCH

10:40.840 --> 10:44.059
BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPERIENCE
WORKING WITH SERIAL KILLERS.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.908
- WE HELP THEM WRITE AND PRODUCE
ONE-ACT PLAYS ON THE WEEKENDS.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.009
- THEY'RE USUALLY VERY DARK.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.099
- WE'RE ALSO HIRING DECLAN RAND.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.845
- HELLO.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.178
- HIGHLY-TRAINED
CRIMINAL PROFILER

10:54.220 --> 10:56.017
WHO ALSO BROUGHT US OUR FIRST
BIG BREAK IN THE CASE.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.278
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

10:57.320 --> 11:00.710
- HE'S GONNA SHARE WITH US HIS
INITIAL PROFILE OF THE SUSPECT.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.220
WE WILL NOT HAVE ANOTHER SERIAL
KILLER LOOSE ON OUR STREETS.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.227
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, KAREN.

11:06.260 --> 11:10.094
NOW, EACH OF THE VICTIMS
WAS KILLED BY HEMLOCK,

11:10.130 --> 11:13.429
A POISON THAT IN ADDITION
TO BEING A LOT OF FUN TO SAY--

11:13.470 --> 11:14.732
DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
COME ON.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.000
all: HEMLOCK.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.928
- WORKS BY SLOWING SHU'I'TING DOWN
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM,

11:18.970 --> 11:20.198
CREATING AN ALMOST
PEACEFUL DEATH.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.935
- HEMLOCK.

11:21.980 --> 11:23.072
- AND GIVEN THAT THE VICTIMS
WERE ALL OVER THE AGE OF 60

11:23.110 --> 11:24.771
AND SUFFERING FROM
MAJOR ILLNESSES,

11:24.810 --> 11:27.142
I BELIEVE OUR KILLER COULD HAVE
EUTHANISTIC INTENTIONS.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.738
- YOU MEAN LIKE MERCY KILLINGS?

11:28.780 --> 11:30.111
- EXACTLY AND IT'S
MY ESTIMATION

11:30.150 --> 11:32.755
THEY WERE COMMITTED BY
A FEMALE IN HER MID-30$

11:32.790 --> 11:35.111
MOST LIKELY SUFFERING FROM AN
OVERWHELMING COMPASSIONATE SIDE.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.754
- I KNOW WHO IT IS.
- WHO?

11:37.790 --> 11:39.326
- ALICIA SILVERSTONE.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.055
BY THE WAY, DECLAN,
HER FIRST ROLE

11:41.100 --> 11:43.227
WAS IN THE MOVIE THE CRUSH.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.158
- ACTUALLY, THAT WAS HER
SECOND ROLE.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.339
SHE FIRST DID AN UNCREDITED
APPEARANCE IN THE WONDER YEARS.

11:47.370 --> 11:49.167
_ N--

11:49.200 --> 11:51.236
SHE DID.
HE'S RIGHT.

11:51.270 --> 11:54.000
HE'S GOOD.
- HEMLOCK.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.235
- OKAY, NOW THAT WE'VE GOT
THAT ALL CLEARED UP,

11:56.280 --> 11:59.249
LET'S GO OUT THERE
AND GET THIS GUY...OR GIRL.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.155
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, SHAWN?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.192
- FIRST, YOU HIRE
TWO GERIATRIC COPS.

12:14.230 --> 12:16.050
FINE.
NOW YOU BRING IN THIS

12:16.100 --> 12:18.762
HACKY PROFILER WITH
THE WORLD'S WORST NAME

12:18.800 --> 12:20.495
AND THE MOST IMPOSSIBLY
DARK EYE LASHES

12:20.540 --> 12:21.893
ON ANY MAN EVER.
- HEMLOCK.

12:21.940 --> 12:22.838
- STOP IT.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.462
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA REALIZE
THAT GUS AND I

12:24.510 --> 12:25.534
ARE ALL YOU NEED?

12:25.570 --> 12:28.130
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,
I AGREE ABOUT THE NAME,

12:28.180 --> 12:30.444
BUT THIS GUY IS NOT
A HACK, SHAWN.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.209
I HAVE GOT GLOWING
RECOMMENDATIONS

12:32.250 --> 12:33.547
FROM TWO DIFFERENT
CHIEFS OF POLICE.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.241
CHECK OUT HIS RESUME.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.080
- HE HAS A MASTERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AND CRIMINOLOGY FROM HARVARD

12:39.120 --> 12:40.348
AND AN MBA?
- GET OUT OF HERE.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.982
HE'S GOT A MONKEY
BASKETBALL LEAGUE?

12:42.020 --> 12:43.521
- SHAWN, THIS GUY IS GOOD.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.255
I HOPE YOU'RE UP
TO THE CHALLENGE.

12:45.290 --> 12:46.826
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- OH, COME ON, KID.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.521
LET'S FACE IT.
YOU'VE BEEN SLOPPY LATELY.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.824
YOU'RE SHOWING UP AT CRIME
SCENES AFTER A LATE NIGHT OUT.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.019
- OR IN.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.437
- AND YOU MAILED IN THE LAST
CASE I GAVE YOU, LITERALLY.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.903
- MY EMAIL WAS DOWN.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.009
BESIDES, I WAS RIGHT,
WASN'T I?

12:58.040 --> 12:59.132
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.239
- HOW DOES THAT NOT MATTER?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.999
- THE POINT IS, IF YOU
WANT TO HANG WITH THIS GUY,

13:03.050 --> 13:04.301
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO UP YOUR GAME.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.170
- PLEASE.

13:06.210 --> 13:09.043
DECLAN RAND CAN'T TOUCH MY GAME.
YOU KNOW WHY?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.809
BECAUSE IT'S ON FIRE
AND IT'S COVERED

13:10.850 --> 13:14.149
WITH THOSE LITTLE THINGS
THAT PORCUPINES HAVE.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.179
- QUILLS.

13:15.220 --> 13:20.328
- YOU WATCH WHILE I SMOKE
THIS ARROGANT FOOL.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.897
- HEY, GUYS,
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

13:22.930 --> 13:25.069
I AM BLOWN AWAY
BY THE NUMBERS OF CASES

13:25.100 --> 13:26.124
YOU'VE SOLVED OVER THE YEARS.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.364
I JUST LOOKED IT UP.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.197
IT'S AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE
TO BE WORKING WITH BOTH OF YOU.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.502
- SOMEONE LIKES THEMSELVES.

13:30.540 --> 13:31.529
- THAN KS, DECLAN.

13:31.570 --> 13:33.470
- YEAH, MAN, I GOT TO BE HONEST.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.535
I'M JUST NOT A BIG BELIEVER
IN THE ABILITY

13:35.580 --> 13:38.071
TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY PROFILE
A COMPLETE STRANGER.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.577
- WELL, I RESPECT THAT,
BUT I DO IT SUCCESSFULLY

13:39.610 --> 13:41.077
ALL THE TIME.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.246
- REALLY?
[chuckles]

13:42.280 --> 13:43.542
TRY ME.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.080
- I'D REALLY PREFER NOT TO.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.018
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.484
- WELL, THE TRUTH IS I--
- YOU'RE NOT ABLE.

13:48.520 --> 13:52.024
- YOU'RE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT,
BUT YOU'RE SHAMEFUL

13:52.060 --> 13:53.527
OF THAT FACT,
SO YOU PLAY IT DOWN

13:53.560 --> 13:55.255
WITH THE USE
OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR,

13:55.300 --> 13:57.268
AND YOU LIVE IN FEAR
OF SHOWING WEAKNESS

13:57.300 --> 14:00.064
SO YOU HIDE BEHIND A CONSTANT
BARRAGE OF JOKES AND SARCASM.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.568
- I AGREE.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.160
NOT.
SAID THE LIAR.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.337
- NOT SURE THOSE TWO
GO TOGETHER.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.972
"SAID THE LIAR"
CANCELS "NOT" OUT.

14:09.010 --> 14:11.547
- SO DOES YOUR FACE.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.138
WHAT ELSE?

14:13.180 --> 14:15.375
- I'VE NOTICED YOU OVERLY
ENUNCIATE WORDS AT TIMES,

14:15.420 --> 14:18.218
WHICH I SUSPECT IS SOME
KIND OF NERVOUS REACTION

14:18.250 --> 14:19.615
TO CONFRONTATION
OR AWKWARDNESS.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.619
- YEAH.
COULDN'T BE FURTHER OFF.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.088
- TAKE CARE.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.563
- HE WASN'T OFF.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.898
- I KNOW.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.999
- AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE
THE BODY OF OUR VICTIM

14:35.040 --> 14:36.064
FROM THE PARK RIGHT HERE.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.638
AND RIGHT HERE WE HAVE
MS. MILLER AND MR. HODGES.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.308
- WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE?

14:41.340 --> 14:44.548
- OH, THAT'S A PHOTO MY
15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER'S TAKEN

14:44.580 --> 14:46.241
FOR HER PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.645
- IS THAT DEAD PERSON YOU?

14:47.680 --> 14:49.238
- VERY OBSERVANT.
YES.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.145
IT'S AMAZING WHAT JUST A--
REALLY--

14:51.190 --> 14:53.283
A LITTLE KETCHUP
AND BABY POWDER CAN DO.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.154
ANYWAY, I THINK THAT I AGREE
WITH DECLAN'S THEORY

14:57.190 --> 14:59.226
THAT TH ESE ARE ALL MERCY
KILLINGS.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.148
- WHAT?
LOOK, WOODY,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.191
WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR THE FACTS HERE.

15:03.230 --> 15:04.197
- SINCE WHEN?

15:04.230 --> 15:05.492
- YOU SEE, EACH OF THESE VICTIMS

15:05.530 --> 15:07.066
WAS SUFFERING FROM
A LIFE-THREATENING DISEASE.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.398
CIRRHOSIS AND ADVANCED
HEPATITIS, RESPECT IVELY,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.658
AND MRS. FRIEDMAN HERE WAS
SUFFERING FROM WILSON'S DISEASE.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.235
- WILSON'S DISEASE?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.168
- "YOUR PATIENT DYING
OF WILSON'S DISEASE

15:16.210 --> 15:17.700
IS GOING TO GET A LIVER
FROM THE DONOR LIST,"

15:17.750 --> 15:19.308
EXCLAIMED CHASE.

15:19.350 --> 15:21.944
EDEN WAS ECSTATIC.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.538
"BUT IF I DO THE SURGERY,
THE BLOOD LOSS

15:23.590 --> 15:25.444
"WILL BE ENORMOUS,
BECAUSE I WILL MOST LIKELY

15:25.490 --> 15:27.458
DRINK HALF OF IT."

15:27.490 --> 15:29.185
EDEN WAS IN A BIND.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.687
- YEAH, SHE WAS.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.220
YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED
TO MOCK ME

15:32.260 --> 15:33.295
FOR LISTENING
TO THOSE BOOKS AGAIN.

15:33.330 --> 15:34.319
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.349
- WHAT IS IT?

15:35.400 --> 15:39.427
- THOSE WERE NOT MERCY KILLINGS.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.435
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IN SAM'S HELL THIS HAS TO DO

15:48.480 --> 15:49.708
WITH A TRANSPLANT LIST,
BUT I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN

15:49.740 --> 15:51.401
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.441
- I SAY WE TRUST SHAWN'S
INSTINCTS ON THIS ONE.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.617
- SAID THE LIAR.

15:54.650 --> 15:56.140
- HE WAS SUPPORTING YOU.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.716
- REALLY?
I JUMPED THE GUN.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.240
- EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE?

15:59.290 --> 16:02.111
I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT YOU
WERE ASKING FOR.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.752
IT'S A LIST OF ALL
OF THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA

16:03.790 --> 16:05.280
WAITING FOR A LIVER TRANSPLANT.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.252
- OH, CRAP.
- WHAT?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.518
- LOOK AT THE FIRST THREE NAMES.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.768
- PETER HODGES, VERONICA MILLER,
LUCY FRIEDMAN.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.165
- SOMEONE COULD
BE KILLING PEOPLE OFF

16:14.200 --> 16:15.189
TO MOVE UP THE LIST.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.264
- EXACTLY.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.528
NICE TRY THOUGH, BUDDY.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.265
- HMM.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.278
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHO'S THE NEXT PERSON IN LINE?

16:21.310 --> 16:23.278
- CATHERINE BICKS.

16:23.310 --> 16:25.574
- AGE?
- 35.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.374
SHE TOTALLY MATCHES
YOUR PROFILE.

16:28.420 --> 16:30.411
- WELL DONE, DECLAN.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.213
- "WELL DONE, DECLAN"?

16:32.250 --> 16:34.115
SINCE WHEN DO YOU USE
FIRST NAMES?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.218
- WE NEED TO TRACK
THIS GIRL DOWN.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.728
- HEY, I'M THE ONE THAT CAME UP
WITH THE LIST THING.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.284
- GOOD WORK, SHAWN.

16:39.330 --> 16:42.026
- SHUT UP, DECLAN.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.158
- KRISTA, HEY.
SHAWN SPENCER HERE.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.600
YES, I AM THE ONE THAT TOOK YOU
TO THAT DODGERS GAME.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.198
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
BACK UP.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.275
I DID NOT RUN ONTO THE FIELD.

16:56.310 --> 16:59.507
I MERELY TOOK A FEW STEPS
TO FOLLOW A FOUL BALL.

16:59.550 --> 17:02.439
ENDED UP IN CENTER FIELD AFTER
IT RICOCHETED OFF A DIVIDER

17:02.480 --> 17:05.483
WHERE I PROCEEDED TO MAKE LIKE
BILLY "WHITE SHOES" JOHNSON.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.556
I REALIZE THAT REFERENCE
IS LOST ON YOU.

17:07.590 --> 17:10.479
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON SATURDAY?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.259
HELLO?

17:12.290 --> 17:14.224
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT
SLEEP HERE AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.557
- NOPE.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.727
GOT HERE HALF AN HOUR AGO
TO GET STUFF DONE.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.328
WHAT?

17:19.370 --> 17:21.292
TRIED TO MAKE SOME JOE,
BUT OUR COFFEE MAKER'S BUSTED.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.591
- WE DON'T HAVE A COFFEE MAKER.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.834
- WHAT WAS I FIDDLING WITH
FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR?

17:23.870 --> 17:25.269
- WHAT IS ALL THAT?

17:25.310 --> 17:26.538
- THIS?
THIS RIGHT HERE?

17:26.570 --> 17:29.175
THIS IS RESEARCH I DUG UP
ON ALL THE PEOPLE

17:29.210 --> 17:30.302
THAT MAKE UP
THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.772
- HMM.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.370
I GOT TO SAY, SHAWN,
THIS IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.444
- MM-HMM.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.640
- I GUESS YOUR DAD SHOULD
HIRE RINGERS MORE OFTEN.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.783
- TRUST ME ON THIS.

17:37.820 --> 17:39.617
DECLAN IS NO RINGER.

17:39.650 --> 17:42.551
ONCE I'VE PROVED THAT THE KILLER
IS SOMEONE ON THIS LIST

17:42.590 --> 17:44.649
NOT NAMED CATHERINE BICKS,
EVERYONE,

17:44.690 --> 17:46.282
INCLUDING JULIET,
WILL REALIZE THAT.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.524
- OKAY, I GET IT.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.720
SO YOU FIGURE IF YOU CAN WIN
THIS CASE,

17:48.760 --> 17:50.193
THEN YOU'LL WIN JULIET.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.095
- NO, BUT IF MAKING DECLAN
LOOK SUCKY

17:52.130 --> 17:55.167
SOMEHOW DIMINISHES HIS APPEAL
IN JULIET'S EYES, I'LL TAKE IT.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.667
LOOK, GUS, THIS ISN'T PERSONAL.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.634
- YOU DO REALIZE EVERYTHING
YOU JUST SAID

17:58.670 --> 17:59.864
IS THE DEFINITION
OF "PERSONAL," RIGHT?

17:59.910 --> 18:01.798
- NOT.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.741
[cell phone rings]

18:04.780 --> 18:06.509
HELLO, DAD.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.415
- CATHERINE BICKS WAS SPOTTED
ENTERING HER HOUSE

18:08.450 --> 18:09.371
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

18:09.420 --> 18:13.481
YOU TWO HAVE TO GET
OVER THERE IMMEDIATELY.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.511
SHAWN?

18:15.560 --> 18:16.618
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

18:16.660 --> 18:20.494
- MY HUMIDIFIER LOOKS
NOTHING LIKE A COFFEE MAKER.

18:20.530 --> 18:23.226
- I'LL BUY YOU A NEW ONE.

18:29.170 --> 18:31.161
- TO CATHERINE, SHE WAS
JUSTIFIED IN KILLING

18:31.210 --> 18:32.563
THE PEOPLE AHEAD OF HER
ON THAT LIST

18:32.610 --> 18:35.579
BECAUSE UNLIKE THEM, SHE HAS
ENTIRE LIFE AHEAD OF HER.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.601
WE CALL IT SOCIOPATHIC
RATIONALIZATION.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.572
- UGH, I FIND THAT
STUFF FASCINATING.

18:39.610 --> 18:41.578
- ME TOO.
- DON'T SAY, "NOT."

18:41.620 --> 18:43.508
NONE OF THOSE STUPID EXPRESSIONS
ARE COMING BACK.

18:43.550 --> 18:44.585
- THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT
HAMMER PANTS.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.712
- WHICH NEVER CAME BACK.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.411
- THEN WHY DID I JUST
BUY THREE PAIR?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.348
- BECAUSE YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
- BECAUSE IT'S HAMMER TIME.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.550
- IT'S NEVER HAMMER TIME, SHAWN.

18:50.590 --> 18:54.856
- DARE YOU TO TELL HAMMER THAT.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.492
- CAN I HELP YOU?

18:56.530 --> 18:57.758
- CATHERINE BICKS,
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU

18:57.800 --> 19:00.496
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT A RECENT
STRING OF MURDERS IN THIS AREA.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.667
- WOW.

19:02.700 --> 19:06.409
OKAY, COME ON IN.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.408
I'M NOT A SUSPECT, AM I?

19:08.440 --> 19:12.342
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHOULD YOU BE?

19:12.380 --> 19:13.779
- [stammering]

19:13.820 --> 19:15.469
LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE, BUT I--

19:15.520 --> 19:16.748
- MA'AM, PLEASE KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.213
- NO, I JUST NEED TO GRAB--

19:18.250 --> 19:21.617
- PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR NOW!

19:31.570 --> 19:34.391
- CATHERINE, HI.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.533
I'M SENSING THAT YOU RECENTLY
SPENT SOME TIME

19:36.570 --> 19:37.969
IN SWITZERLAND.
IS THAT CORRECT?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.466
- YEAH.

19:39.510 --> 19:41.671
I WAS VISITING MY LIVER
SPECIALIST THERE.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.644
- MM-HMM.
GOOD TWO WEEKS OR SO?

19:43.680 --> 19:44.669
- 2 1/2.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.246
- YOU CAN PROVE THAT?

19:46.280 --> 19:48.316
- MY PASSPORT'S IN MY PURSE.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.510
THAT'S WHAT I WAS REACHING
FOR BEFORE HE PULLED

19:49.550 --> 19:52.747
THIS GIANT GUN OUT AT ME.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.714
- IT'S STAMPED.

19:59.630 --> 20:01.325
- CATHERINE, I AM SO SORRY.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.568
UM, YOU HAVE YOURSELF
A GREAT DAY, OKAY?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.565
- [coughs]
OOPS.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.838
YOU PLAY SOFTBALL?

20:11.870 --> 20:14.373
I PLAY.

20:14.410 --> 20:15.672
FEELS FUN.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.473
THIS IS PROBABLY
A WEIRD TIME TO ASK,

20:17.510 --> 20:20.513
BUT DO YOU HAVE PLANS
ON SATURDAY?

20:20.550 --> 20:22.518
- ARE YOU SURE WE DON'T WANT
TO ASK HER MORE QUESTIONS?

20:22.550 --> 20:24.586
SHE WAS A PRECISE MATCH
IN MY PROFILE.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.815
- YOUR PROFILE CAN KISS MY BIG,
ROUND, WHITE DUMPER, DECLAN.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.886
I DO NOT ENJOY POINTING
MY GUN AT INNOCENT WOMEN.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.729
- YOU DON'T?
- NO.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.988
I'M NOT 29 ANYMORE.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.554
- IT WAS A GOOD EFFORT, DECK.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.692
- I GUESS WE SHOULD CHECK
THE NEXT PERSON

20:34.730 --> 20:35.492
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

20:35.530 --> 20:38.897
- YEAH, THAT IS
A LEONARD JIMENEZ.

20:38.930 --> 20:40.693
HE LIVES AT 19 WILLOW STREET.
THAT'S 10 MINUTES FROM HERE.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.628
- LET'S GO.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.730
- GUS AND I WILL MEET YOU THERE.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.641
- WHY THE HELL ARE WE
AT A HOTEL?

20:53.680 --> 20:56.774
- BECAUSE LEONARD JIMENEZ DIED
OF LIVER CANCER THREE DAYS AGO.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.640
I LEARNED THAT IN MY RESEARCH
THIS MORNING.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.318
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THAT
TO LASSITER AND JULIET?

21:01.360 --> 21:02.884
- MUST HAVE SLIPPED
MY MIND, GUS.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.354
LOOK, IN THE HOUR OR SO IT TAKES
THEM TO PUT IT TOGETHER,

21:05.390 --> 21:07.426
I FIGURE WE'LL BUST
THE NEXT PERSON ON THE LIST,

21:07.460 --> 21:08.427
WHO I KNOW
IS THE REAL KILLER,

21:08.460 --> 21:11.293
AND DECLAN CAN'T SWOOP
IN AND STEAL MY THUNDER

21:11.330 --> 21:13.366
LIKE THE LITTLE
THUNDER-STEALER HE IS.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.697
- YOU ARE AN UNBELIEVABLE
PERSON.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.368
WHO'S THE NEXT PERSON
ON THIS LIST?

21:17.410 --> 21:21.369
- THAT GUY.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.742
[laughter]

21:23.780 --> 21:25.668
- EVERYONE HERE HAS
A HANDFUL OF STORIES

21:25.710 --> 21:27.575
ABOUT OLD FITZY.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.770
I KNOW I HAVE ABOUT
THREE HANDFULS,

21:29.820 --> 21:31.344
WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.688
[laughter]

21:33.720 --> 21:35.517
- FITZ LOOKS SCARY, GUS.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.811
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S GUILTY, SHAWN.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.054
- YOU LOOKING AT HIM?
- YES.

21:38.090 --> 21:39.125
- PURE EVIL.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.355
STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERWHELM
ANY ONE OF OUR VICTIMS.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.721
PLUS, HE HAS AN ARREST RECORD
AND WE'VE GONE ON FAR LESS.

21:43.770 --> 21:44.964
- WELL, HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON APPREHENDING HIM?

21:45.000 --> 21:46.558
IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVE GUNS.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.999
- NO, BUT I HAVE THIS.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.769
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
CHECK HIS REFLEXES?

21:49.800 --> 21:51.631
- IT WAS THE ONLY WEAPON-LIKE
THING YOU HAD IN THE CAR.

21:51.670 --> 21:52.500
- WELL, YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING,

21:52.540 --> 21:53.973
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT BEING
VERY DISCREET.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.409
- YOU'RE INDISCREET.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.873
- AND HE'S ONE OF
THE KINDEST,

21:56.910 --> 21:58.707
MOST GENEROUS SOULS
WE'VE EVER COME ACR--

21:58.750 --> 22:01.071
- I HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND
OF STORY ABOUT FITZ!

22:01.120 --> 22:02.473
DO YOU MIND, DONNY?

22:02.520 --> 22:03.839
- MY NAME'S GREG.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.643
- ONE OF ILLNESS BOTH MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL

22:06.690 --> 22:10.956
AND UNRELENTING GREED.

22:10.990 --> 22:14.619
ON THE OUTSIDE,
HE MAY LOOK WARM, KIND,

22:14.660 --> 22:15.524
AND LIKE THE COACH
FROM WHITE SHADOW,

22:15.560 --> 22:19.394
BUT ON THE INSIDE
IS A COLD, DARK SOUL

22:19.430 --> 22:21.398
CAPABLE OF TAKING
THE LIVES OF OTHERS

22:21.440 --> 22:22.839
IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS OWN.

22:22.870 --> 22:25.532
I AM AFRAID,
MEMBERS OF THE JOBA SOCIETY,

22:25.570 --> 22:26.639
THAT YOUR FITZY...

22:26.670 --> 22:27.637
- UH-OH.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.672
- IS A COLD-BLOODED MURDERER!

22:30.710 --> 22:33.042
[crowd gasps]

22:33.080 --> 22:35.139
- THAT'S NOT FITZY.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.387
- WHERE'S FITZY?

22:46.460 --> 22:48.121
- YOU EMBARRASSED
A WELL-RESPECT ED,

22:48.160 --> 22:50.094
NOT TO MENTION SERIOUSLY ILL
MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY,

22:50.130 --> 22:52.496
SHAWN, AT HIS OWN
AWARD CEREMONY.

22:52.530 --> 22:53.462
- WHO HAD AN ARREST RECORD.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.628
- IT INVOLVED A PEACEFUL
PROTEST IN THE '605.

22:56.670 --> 22:59.468
- THAT WAS NOT SPECIFIED
IN THE GOOGLE INFO I RECEIVED.

22:59.510 --> 23:00.932
- PLUS, THE FACT
THAT YOU LIED TO US.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.834
- IT WAS A LIE OF OMISSION,
LASSIE.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.575
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
COME ON.

23:04.610 --> 23:06.100
WE MADE A MISTAKE.
_ "WE"?

23:06.150 --> 23:09.415
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
GUS MADE A MISTAKE.

23:09.450 --> 23:10.986
LOOK...

23:11.020 --> 23:12.578
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
TO DWELL ON MISTAKES

23:12.620 --> 23:14.417
WHEN THERE IS A MURDERER
ON THE LOOSE.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.688
YOU DON'T HEAR ME BRINGING
UP DECLAN'S

23:15.720 --> 23:16.812
ERRONEOUS PROFILE THAT RESULTED

23:16.860 --> 23:18.748
IN LASSITER SCARING THE CRAP OUT
OF AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.452
- APPRECIATE THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.149
WE JUST GOT A BIG BREAK.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.792
WE JUST HAD A MAN WHO CAME
FORWARD WHO CLAIMS

23:24.830 --> 23:26.695
TO HAVE WITNESSED
A STRANGER SWITCHING

23:26.730 --> 23:28.561
LUCY FRIEDMAN'S INSECT REPELLENT
LAST NIGHT.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.468
- LET ME GUESS...
HE WAS HOMELESS.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.637
- YES, WELL DONE.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.671
HE JUST SAT WITH
OUR SKETCH ARTIST AND I BELIEVE

23:36.710 --> 23:40.578
WE HAVE THE FIRST
LOOK AT OUR SUSPECT.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.542
- LOOKS LIKE CATHERINE BICKS
TO ME.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.047
- DAMN IT, WE HAD HER.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.547
- YOU HAD HER AND YOU
JUST WALKED AWAY

23:46.590 --> 23:47.682
WITHOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?

23:47.720 --> 23:49.688
- I PULLED MY GUN ON HER.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.948
- SHE HAD A STAMPED
PASSPORT THAT SAID

23:50.990 --> 23:52.878
SHE'D BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY
FOR TWO WEEKS.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.727
- CLEARLY, IT WAS A PHONY.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.819
NO WONDER SHE REFUSED
POLICE PROTECTION.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.020
COME ON, PEOPLE.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.822
AND THAT WAS GOOD WORK, DECLAN.

23:59.870 --> 24:01.861
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.630
- YES, GOOD WORK, DECLAN.

24:04.670 --> 24:07.707
WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE
DOUBTED YOU.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.435
- GUG.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.770
- NO, IT IS.
IT'S GONNA BE A BLAST AND WHITE.

24:15.820 --> 24:18.948
OKAY, LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING YOU TOO, GINA.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.687
BYE-BYE.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.950
- YOU DID NOT JUST INVITE CRAZY
GINA RAPACH TO THAT WEDDING.

24:24.990 --> 24:26.821
- LOOK, DUDE,
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.919
LAST GIRLS I ASKED ARE EITHER
OUT OF THE COUNTRY,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.064
RECENTLY MARRIED, OR WANTED
FOR POISONING PEOPLE.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.988
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU
EVEN SPOKE TO HER?

24:33.030 --> 24:34.736
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS THE NIGHT I WAS SHOT.

24:34.770 --> 24:37.659
- GINA IS NOT THE KIND OF GIRL
TO BE MESSING WITH, SHAWN.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.404
SHE IS OBSESSED WITH YOU.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.704
- WOULD YOU RELAX?
IT'S FINE.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.799
SHE KNOWS WE'RE ONLY FRIENDS.
IT'S A ONE-OFF.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.047
- HE'S GONNA MARRY ME.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.810
[laughter]

24:49.850 --> 24:51.681
- ANY LUCK?
- NO.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.210
IT LOOKS LIKE SHE TOOK OFF
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.979
- SHE COULD BE HALFWAY
TO CHINA BY NOW.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.011
- PRETTY SURE SOMEWHERE
OUTSIDE OF VEGAS.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.585
- I'M BETTING SHE'S
STILL CLOSE BY.

24:59.630 --> 25:00.449
- WHY IS THAT?

25:00.490 --> 25:02.697
- THIS ISN'T A PERSON
DRIVEN BY FEAR

25:02.730 --> 25:04.220
OR ANY EMOTION FOR THAT MATTER.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.226
I STRONGLY SUSPECT
SHE'S SUFFERING

25:06.270 --> 25:08.591
FROM A MAJOR DEPERSONALIZATION
DISORDER.

25:08.640 --> 25:09.698
- WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT TERM BEFORE?

25:09.740 --> 25:11.037
- DPD?
- NO.

25:11.070 --> 25:12.662
THE DEPERSONALIZATION THING.

25:12.710 --> 25:15.201
- IT'S A DISORDER
CHARACTERIZED

25:15.240 --> 25:18.801
BY FEELING DETACHED FROM ONE'S
MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL PROCESS.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.045
CATHERINE'S CURRENTLY GOING
THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LIFE

25:21.080 --> 25:23.139
WITHOUT ACTUALLY
EXPERIENCING THEM.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.240
- CHASE SUFFERS FROM
DEPERSONALIZATION DISORDER,

25:26.290 --> 25:27.882
CHARACTERIZED
BY FEELING DETACHED

25:27.920 --> 25:30.218
FROM ONE'S MENTAL
OR EMOTIONAL PROCESS.

25:30.260 --> 25:32.182
HE'S CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH
THE MOTIONS OF LIFE

25:32.230 --> 25:33.857
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THEM.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.698
IT'S AS IF HE WERE
A CHARACTER IN A MOVIE.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.766
- IT'S AS IF SHE WERE
A CHARACTER IN A MOVIE.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.324
THEREFORE, I ANTICIPATE
HER NEXT MOVE

25:40.370 --> 25:42.634
TO BE MORE LOGICAL
THAN EMOTIONAL.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.934
- DO YOU, DECLAN?

25:44.970 --> 25:46.107
- YOU GOT IT.

25:46.140 --> 25:49.075
CHIEF WANTS US TO REGROUP
BACK AT THE STATION AT 4:00.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.078
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BREAK TILL THEN.

25:51.110 --> 25:52.907
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS THERE.

25:52.950 --> 25:57.171
- NOT IF WE SEE YOU
FIRST, BUDDY.

25:57.220 --> 26:00.246
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?
- THREE THINGS.

26:00.290 --> 26:03.851
ONE, I'M NOT THE ONLY CLOSET
CHICK-LIT LOVER AROUND HERE.

26:03.890 --> 26:06.688
TWO, DECLAN IS A COMPLETE FRAUD.

26:06.730 --> 26:10.291
AND "H," HE MAY JUST
BE OUR MURDERER.

26:19.310 --> 26:20.459
WHILE YOU WERE ANNOYINGLY
TALKING TO KIM

26:20.510 --> 26:23.274
FOR THE NINTH TIME TODAY,
I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH HARVARD,

26:23.310 --> 26:25.847
WHO SAID THAT THERE IS NO RECORD
OF DECLAN GOING THERE.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.643
- SO THE GUY LIED ON HIS RESUME.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.375
IF THAT MAKES SOMEONE A KILLER,
THEN YOU'RE TED BUNDY.

26:29.420 --> 26:30.478
- LOOK, GUS,
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME

26:30.520 --> 26:32.385
OR THE FACT THAT I WASN'T REALLY
A BACKGROUND DANCER

26:32.420 --> 26:33.387
IN THE THRILLER VIDEO.

26:33.420 --> 26:36.014
THIS IS ABOUT DECLAN,
A CRAZY SERIAL KILLER

26:36.060 --> 26:37.618
WHO TARGETED THE PEOPLE
ON THAT LIST

26:37.660 --> 26:39.025
BECAUSE HE KNEW SOMEONE ELSE
WOULD LOOK GUILTY.

26:39.060 --> 26:41.927
THIS GUY IS PRETENDING
TO BE A CRIMINAL PROFILER

26:41.960 --> 26:43.962
SO THAT HE CAN STEER
US IN THAT DIRECTION.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.399
- BUT YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO FIGURED OUT

26:45.430 --> 26:46.761
THEY WERE ALL IN NEED
OF A LIVER.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.836
- OH, NOW YOU WANT
TO ADMIT THAT.

26:48.870 --> 26:50.394
DECLAN HAD THE SAME
INFORMATION I DID.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.635
HE JUST LET ME GET THERE FIRST.

26:52.670 --> 26:55.207
I KNOW THIS MAN BECAUSE HE ALSO
LISTENED TO INTERNITY.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.730
- OR READ.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.008
- I JUST SAID HE DIDN'T GO
TO HARVARD, GUS.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.176
- I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

26:59.210 --> 27:00.404
MAYBE YOU HAVE A THING
AGAINST PROFILERS.

27:00.450 --> 27:01.974
- HE'S GUILTY, ALL RIGHT?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.647
AND FOR THE RECORD,
LASSIE AGREES.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.079
I RAN THE THEORY BY HIM.
- WHY WOULD YOU CONSULT LASSIE?

27:06.120 --> 27:09.351
- BECAUSE UNLIKE YOU AND JULES,
HE'S NOT SMITTEN WITH THIS GUY.

27:09.390 --> 27:10.357
- I'M NOT SMITTEN.

27:10.390 --> 27:11.755
- YOU'RE JIMMY SMITTEN.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.655
TRUST ME, GUS.

27:13.700 --> 27:16.897
EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY IS A LIE.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.731
- WHERE THE HECK IS HE GOING?

27:31.310 --> 27:33.403
ONCE AGAIN,
WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF TRYING

27:33.450 --> 27:35.418
TO APPREHEND A POTENTIAL KILLER
WITHOUT A WEAPON.

27:35.450 --> 27:36.917
- DON'T WORRY.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.214
I CAME PREPARED THIS TIME.

27:39.250 --> 27:42.253
[indistinct whispering]

27:46.760 --> 27:48.421
HELLO, DECLAN.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.894
- HEY, GUYS.

27:50.930 --> 27:54.696
WELCOME TO THE BARBECUE
I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS THROWING.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.731
COME ON IN.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.437
- SWEET PLACE.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.879
- WHOSE IS IT, DECLAN?

28:04.910 --> 28:06.343
IF DECLAN'S EVEN YOUR
REAL NAME.

28:06.380 --> 28:10.214
IF IT'S NOT, BY THE WAY,
YOU MADE A RIDICULOUS CHOICE.

28:10.250 --> 28:11.888
- IT'S MINE.
- RIGHT.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.808
DID YOU PAY FOR IT WITH
ALL YOUR PROFILER MONEY?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.487
- I THINK HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH, SHAWN.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.680
- COME ON, GUS.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.848
WHAT ABOUT THIS PLACE WOULD
POSSIBLY MAKE YOU SAY THAT?

28:19.890 --> 28:22.097
OTHER THAN THE GIANT PORTRAIT
OF HIM HANGING ON THE WALL

28:22.130 --> 28:23.768
BEHIND ME NOW.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.028
HOLY CRAP.
YOU'RE RICH, HUH?

28:25.070 --> 28:27.026
- FILTHY, ACTUALLY.

28:27.070 --> 28:29.197
SORRY, THAT'S A CRASS WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.389
I'M SERIOUSLY LOADED.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.500
- THAT PAINTING KIND OF MAKES
YOU LOOK LIKE JOHN STAMOS.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.804
- THANK YOU.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.501
WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON DROPPING
THAT GRILL FORK?

28:37.540 --> 28:41.112
- SOON AS YOU AGREE
TO TELL US YOUR REAL STORY.

28:41.150 --> 28:43.471
- FAIR ENOUGH.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.010
WALK WITH ME, GENTLEMEN.

28:45.050 --> 28:47.757
- * WHEN THEY DO I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU *

28:47.790 --> 28:50.088
- SO ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO,
I WAS JUST RUNNING

28:50.120 --> 28:52.122
A SMALL HEDGE FUND
AND I JUST DECIDED

28:52.160 --> 28:54.048
TO MAKE A BUNCH OF BETS
AGAINST THE HOUSING MARKET.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.522
FEW MONTHS LATER, BAM!

28:55.560 --> 28:57.448
THEY WERE BACKING A TRUCK UP
TO MY HOUSE.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.058
- * HAD TO FADE IT

28:59.100 --> 29:04.538
* EVERYBODY WANTS
TO RULE THE-- *

29:04.570 --> 29:07.107
- EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

29:07.140 --> 29:08.903
EXCUSE ME!
- YES?

29:08.940 --> 29:11.773
- WHY IS THERE A MAN WHO LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE CURT SMITH

29:11.810 --> 29:13.846
FROM TEARS FOR FEARS PLAYING
AN ACOUSTIC SET

29:13.880 --> 29:16.371
NEXT TO THAT TREE
AND YOUR SWIMMING POOL?

29:16.420 --> 29:18.217
- I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE INTRODUCED YOU.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.786
CURT, MEET SHAWN AND GUS.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.082
- AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.418
- OH, DEAR GOD.
IT'S YOU.

29:23.460 --> 29:25.485
THE REAL YOU.
THE FLESHY YOU.

29:25.530 --> 29:26.781
I LOVE YOU.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.024
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

29:28.060 --> 29:31.268
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

29:31.300 --> 29:32.961
- I THINK I DO NOW.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.934
- YEAH, I FLEW CURT IN

29:34.970 --> 29:37.131
TO PLAY A PARTY I WAS THROWING
THIS PAST WEEKEND

29:37.170 --> 29:38.307
AND HE JUST DECIDED TO STAY
A FEW EXTRA DAYS

29:38.340 --> 29:39.807
'CAUSE WE REALLY HIT IT OFF.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.932
- AND HE'S PAYING ME.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.800
- YEAH, BUT IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE
WE ENJOY HANGING, RIGHT?

29:42.840 --> 29:44.068
- IT'S BEEN A BALL OF FUN.

29:44.110 --> 29:46.806
YOU ARE PAYING ME, RIGHT?
- YES.

29:46.850 --> 29:47.817
- WELL, BECAUSE, UM--
- MAD WORLD.

29:47.850 --> 29:49.078
MAD WORLD.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.917
- * ALL AROUND ME
ARE FAMILIAR FACES *

29:50.950 --> 29:52.019
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

29:52.050 --> 29:53.915
IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY AROUND
HERE.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.417
ANYWAY, SO THERE I WAS
IN MY LATE 30$,

29:56.460 --> 29:57.825
NEVER HAVING TO WORRY
ABOUT MONEY AGAIN,

29:57.860 --> 29:59.350
SO I DECIDED TO PURSUE
THE CHILDHOOD DREAM.

29:59.390 --> 30:01.392
- CRIMINAL PROFILER?
- NO, SUSHI CHEF.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.557
BUT THE WHOLE SEVEN-YEAR THING,
IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.465
SO THEN I THOUGHT,
"HOW COOL WOULD IT BE

30:05.500 --> 30:07.092
TO SOLVE CRIME ALL DAY?"

30:07.130 --> 30:08.859
AND I KNEW ALL THIS STUFF
ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY

30:08.900 --> 30:10.458
'CAUSE MY DAD USED
TO BE A THERAPIST.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.865
- SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.161
- SO I FUDGED A FEW
QUALIFICATIONS

30:13.210 --> 30:15.371
AND I GAVE IT A SHOT AND TURNS
OUT I HAVE A GIFT.

30:15.410 --> 30:17.605
- * HE HAD A GIFT FOR--

30:17.640 --> 30:18.447
- CURT, PLEASE!

30:18.480 --> 30:22.041
WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT
GOING OFF BOOK?

30:22.080 --> 30:24.583
- * AND I FIND IT
KIND OF FUNNY *

30:24.620 --> 30:27.111
* I FIND IT KIND OF SAD

30:27.150 --> 30:29.414
- LISTEN, YOU GUYS AREN'T GONNA
TELL CHIEF VICK, ARE YOU?

30:29.460 --> 30:31.257
- NO, BUT YOU BETTER
DAMN WELL TELL JULIET.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.587
SHE'S INTO YOU.
- COOL, MAN.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.598
I'M INTO HER.
SHE'S AWESOME.

30:34.630 --> 30:36.450
BUT IF I TELL HER,
MY CAREER COULD BE OVER.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.296
WHAT WOULD I HAVE LEFT?

30:37.330 --> 30:39.025
- MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS?

30:39.070 --> 30:39.968
- WHAT'S YOUR PLAN EXACTLY?

30:40.000 --> 30:41.592
JUST KEEP DATING JULIET
AND KEEP THE FACT

30:41.640 --> 30:43.494
THAT YOU'RE
A COMPLETE PHONY SECRET?

30:43.540 --> 30:45.929
- ISN'T THAT YOUR PLAN?
- NOT TALKING ABOUT ME NOW.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.460
- I REALLY HAVEN'T
THOUGHT IT OUT THAT FAR.

30:47.510 --> 30:48.636
- WELL, LET ME HELP YOU OUT.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.978
SHE IS NOT THE KIND OF GIRL
YOU MESS WITH, ALL RIGHT?

30:51.010 --> 30:52.443
SHE IS THE REAL DEAL.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.141
YOU EITHER TELL HER YOU'RE
A FAKE CRIMINAL PROFILER

30:54.180 --> 30:55.272
OR I WILL.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.469
- YOU DO THAT,
AND THEN I'LL BE FORCED

30:56.520 --> 30:57.509
TO TELL HER YOU'RE
NOT A REAL PSYCHIC.

30:57.550 --> 31:00.610
- * MAD WOR--

31:00.650 --> 31:01.878
- A DRAMATIC PAUSE?
REALLY?

31:01.920 --> 31:03.251
COME ON, CURT.

31:03.290 --> 31:04.518
THAT'S BENEATH YOU, MAN.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.482
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.498
- OH, COME ON, SHAWN.

31:08.530 --> 31:10.350
I'VE BEEN ON TO YOU SINCE
THE BEGINNING.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.493
DON'T FORGET WE READ
THE SAME BOOKS.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.430
- * THEY HAVE
THE SAME TASTE IN-- *

31:14.470 --> 31:15.494
- CURT, FOR CHRISSAKE.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.167
I SAY ONE THING,
YOU DO THE OTHER.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.428
- DON'T SWEAT IT.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

31:18.470 --> 31:20.461
- COULD YOU JUST STOP SAYING
YOU LOVE ME?

31:20.510 --> 31:22.501
- DONE AND DONE.

31:22.540 --> 31:24.508
I DO THOUGH, LOVE YOU,
THAT IS.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.539
- SHAWN?
- WHAT?

31:25.580 --> 31:28.276
I LOVE CURT SMITH
AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.140
I WILL SING IT
FROM THE ROOFTOPS, GUS.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.683
- * EVERYBODY

31:32.720 --> 31:37.453
* WANTS TO RULE THE WORLD

31:37.490 --> 31:43.497
*

31:47.570 --> 31:49.367
- DAD, YOU HAVE GOT
TO FIRE THIS GUY.

31:49.400 --> 31:50.389
HE IS A FRAUD.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.532
- SO ARE YOU.

31:51.570 --> 31:52.707
- YEAH, BUT I'M
A PRODUCTIVE ONE.

31:52.740 --> 31:53.934
- SO IS HE.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.333
- AND HE KNOWS TEARS FOR FEARS.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.472
- HALF. HE KNOWS HALF
OF TEARS FOR FEARS.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.205
THE HALF THAT I LOVE.
THE HALF THAT I WOULD DO ANY--

31:58.250 --> 31:59.569
- SHAWN.

31:59.610 --> 32:01.510
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, SHAWN,
I CAN'T JUST FIRE HIM.

32:01.550 --> 32:03.177
THERE ARE NO LEGAL REQUIREMENTS
ONE NEEDS

32:03.220 --> 32:04.619
TO CALL THEMSELVES
A CRIMINAL PROFILER.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.585
IT WORKED, OKAY?

32:07.620 --> 32:08.985
- HE GETS RESULTS.

32:09.020 --> 32:10.612
AND WHY DON'T YOU QUIT
COMPLAINING TO ME,

32:10.660 --> 32:12.218
GET YOUR ASS OUT
THERE LIKE DECLAN,

32:12.260 --> 32:13.727
AND START TRACKING DOWN
OUR MURDERER?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.648
- YOU'RE LOVING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

32:15.700 --> 32:17.122
- THEY JUST SPOTTED
CATHERINE BICKS

32:17.160 --> 32:20.027
WALKING THROUGH
A PARKING GARAGE.

32:35.650 --> 32:36.969
- AHH.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.612
- UH-OH.

32:38.650 --> 32:39.639
- WE WERE RIGHT, SPENCER.

32:39.690 --> 32:42.215
DECLAN RAND,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

32:42.260 --> 32:45.650
FOR THE MURDER
OF CATHERINE BICKS.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.006
- YOU, TAKE THIS JOKER DOWN
TO INTERROGATION ROOM "A."

33:03.280 --> 33:04.747
- YEP.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.304
I ALWAYS KNEW HE
WAS A NO-GOOD MURDERER.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.614
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW VERY WELL
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.675
- FINE.
I WAS WRONG, PROBABLY.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.312
THE BEST KIND OF WRONG.

33:12.350 --> 33:15.285
THE KIND THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.015
WHAT, GUS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

33:17.060 --> 33:18.288
- HELP PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.525
- ALL RIGHT, STARTING SUNDAY
AFTER THE WEDDING.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.528
- SHAWN.

33:22.560 --> 33:26.166
- OKAY.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.031
LASSIE?
- WHAT?

33:28.070 --> 33:29.560
- BEFORE YOU START YOUR
LEGALLY-QUESTIONABLE

33:29.600 --> 33:31.261
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES,
MAY WE HAVE

33:31.310 --> 33:33.039
FIVE MINUTES WITH DECLAN?

33:33.070 --> 33:35.106
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES,

33:35.140 --> 33:36.471
BUT THEN YOU TELL HIM
I'M COMING

33:36.510 --> 33:39.070
AND HELL IS COMING WITH ME.

33:39.110 --> 33:43.217
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

33:43.250 --> 33:45.138
HEY.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.408
- GUYS, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

33:47.450 --> 33:49.281
WILL YOU DO ME A HUGE FAVOR?

33:49.320 --> 33:50.582
WILL YOU CHECK IN ON CURT
AND MAKE SURE

33:50.620 --> 33:52.178
HE ISN'T THROWING A BENDER?

33:52.230 --> 33:53.754
'CAUSE I THINK HE AND THAT
DUDE FROM CROWDED HOUSE--

33:53.790 --> 33:55.121
I THINK THEY'RE PLOTTING
SOMETHING.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.320
- NEIL FINN?

33:56.360 --> 33:57.497
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE MISSING
THAT.

33:57.530 --> 33:58.519
- WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT GARAGE?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.720
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:00.770 --> 34:03.238
I HEARD ON THE POLICE RADIO
CATHERINE WAS SPOTTED THERE.

34:03.270 --> 34:05.306
I WANTED TO BE THERE FIRST
TO SHOW YOU UP A LITTLE,

34:05.340 --> 34:07.365
AND THEN I ARRIVED
TO FIND HER LAYING DEAD.

34:07.410 --> 34:10.231
BUT WHY WOULD THE POLICE THINK
I WAS A MURDERER?

34:10.280 --> 34:12.271
- THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT
RIGHT NOW.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.141
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO ELSE IT MAY HAVE BEEN?

34:14.180 --> 34:15.545
- I WISH.
THERE'S NO PATTERN

34:15.580 --> 34:16.774
TO THE MURDERS ANYMORE.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.287
THE FIRST THREE WERE POISONED

34:18.320 --> 34:19.810
AND CATHERINE DIED FROM
A BLOW TO THE HEAD.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.488
- YEAH, THAT'S WEIRD.
- YEAH, AND GET THIS.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.851
CATHERINE ALMOST
APPEARED HEALTHIER

34:22.890 --> 34:24.482
THAN SHE DID WHEN
WE FIRST SAW HER.

34:24.530 --> 34:30.298
YOU KNOW,
MINUS THE WHOLE DEAD THING.

34:30.330 --> 34:32.560
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.363
- OH, COME ON, SHAWN.
IT'S JUST US.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.799
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THIS ANYMORE.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.091
- SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE CHALLENGING ME RIGHT NOW?

34:37.140 --> 34:38.129
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

34:38.170 --> 34:39.239
- I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.259
- SO IS YOUR FACE.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.369
- OKAY, SORRY.
WHAT'D YOU GET?

34:42.410 --> 34:44.275
- STAY TUNED.

34:44.310 --> 34:45.299
COME ON, GUS, LET'S GO
HAVE A CONVERSATION

34:45.350 --> 34:46.647
WITH OUR FAVORITE WEIRDO.

34:46.680 --> 34:48.216
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT,
SHAWN,

34:48.250 --> 34:49.717
BUT YOU WERE SPOT ON.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.115
- ABOUT WHAT?

34:51.150 --> 34:52.082
- A LOT OF THINGS.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.213
MY WIFE, FOR EXAMPLE,
WASN'T JUST FRIENDS

34:54.260 --> 34:56.182
WITH THAT COLLEGE FRESHMAN,
AND CATHERINE HERE

34:56.220 --> 34:58.154
WASN'T SUFFERING FROM CIRRHOSIS
OF THE LIVER.

34:58.190 --> 35:00.283
IN FACT, PRIOR TO THE HEAD
TRAUMA THAT ENDED HER LIFE,

35:00.330 --> 35:02.298
SHE WAS THE MODEL OF HEALTH.

35:02.330 --> 35:04.719
- SHE APPLIED MAKEUP UNDER HER
EYES THE DAY THAT WE SAW HER

35:04.770 --> 35:06.169
IN ORDER TO APPEAR SICK.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.690
_- WHY?
[scoffs]

35:07.730 --> 35:09.334
SAME REASON
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

35:09.370 --> 35:10.598
SLEEPS WITH
A STAR LACROSSE PLAYER.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.335
- THOSE ARE COMPLETELY
UNRELATED, WOODY.

35:12.370 --> 35:15.305
- AND BETTER YET, WHY WOULD SHE
WANT TO GET ON A LIST

35:15.340 --> 35:16.876
FOR A NEW LIVER WHEN HERS
WAS PERFECT LY HEALTHY?

35:16.910 --> 35:18.901
- HOW DID SHE GET ON
IS THE BETTER QUESTION.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.714
THERE'S AN INTENSE SCREENING
PROCESS ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH.

35:21.750 --> 35:25.481
THERE IS NO WAY SOMEONE THAT
HEALTHY WOULD GET THAT FAR.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.613
- WOODY, IS SHE A LEFTY
OR A RIGHTY?

35:27.650 --> 35:29.311
- OH, DEFINITELY A RIGHTY.

35:29.360 --> 35:34.320
MUSCLES IN THAT ARM
ARE MUCH MORE DEVELOPED.

35:34.360 --> 35:37.488
- THAT WASN'T CATHERINE
IN THE PHOTO.

35:37.530 --> 35:39.760
WHO USES THE PARKING GARAGE
WHERE SHE WAS KILLED?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.189
- AN APARTMENT COMPLEX, WHY?
- I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.208
YOUR WIFE'S ALSO SLEEPING
WITH HER PERSONAL TRAINER.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.538
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.
I APPROVED THAT ONE.

35:51.710 --> 35:56.170
- I'M SENSING THE KILLER
IS IN APARTMENT FIVE.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.438
- YOU POSITIVE ABOUT THIS?
- ABSOLUTELY.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.288
- OPEN UP!

36:01.320 --> 36:03.481
BETTER BE RIGHT ABOUT THIS,
SPENCER.

36:09.230 --> 36:11.824
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.

36:11.870 --> 36:12.962
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.197
PUT 'EM UP!

36:25.550 --> 36:26.505
- CATHERINE?

36:26.550 --> 36:28.313
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

36:28.350 --> 36:30.238
- NOT CATHERINE.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.417
THIS IS MADDY.

36:31.450 --> 36:34.248
- HER SISTER.
- EXACTLY.

36:34.290 --> 36:37.453
SEE, MADDY IS THE ONE WITH
THE SEVERE LIVER PROBLEMS.

36:37.490 --> 36:40.323
BUT SHE CAN'T QUALIFY
FOR A TRANSPLANT LIST

36:40.360 --> 36:41.725
ON ACCOUNT OF HER ALCOHOLISM.

36:41.760 --> 36:42.897
- I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

36:42.930 --> 36:44.693
- CLEARLY.
MY APOLOGIES.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.290
- SO SHE AND CATHERINE
HATCHED A PLAN.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.764
- MADDY TOOK HER
SISTER'S I.D. TO A DOCTOR

36:49.800 --> 36:51.438
SO SHE COULD GET PUT
ON THE LIST.

36:51.470 --> 36:52.607
- AS CATHERINE.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.959
NOW ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS WAIT

36:54.010 --> 36:55.898
FOR HER NUMBER TO BE CALLED AND
HER LIFE WOULD BE SAVED.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.999
- BUT MADDY WAS GETTING SICKER
AND MORE IMPATIENT.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.679
WHEN CATHERINE LEFT THE COUNTRY,
SHE DECIDED

37:00.710 --> 37:02.644
TO START KILLING PEOPLE
ON THE LIST ABOVE HER,

37:02.680 --> 37:04.580
SO THAT SHE COULD MOVE UP.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.839
- THEY HAD ALL LIVED LONG LIVES.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.755
- NOT THE MOST SYMPATHETIC
DEFENSE.

37:09.790 --> 37:12.258
- THEN CATHERINE GOT HOME,
FOUND OUT WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.952
SHE CONFRONTED YOU
IN THAT PARKING GARAGE.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.058
- WE HAVE GOT
TO GO TO THE COPS.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.989
- WE ARE NOT GOING TO
THE COPS AND IF YOU THINK--

37:19.030 --> 37:20.429
- YOU ARE SO SELFISH!

37:20.470 --> 37:22.597
- I WILL NOT LET YOU!

37:22.640 --> 37:24.665
- AND IN A RAGE,
YOU PUSHED HER DOWN.

37:24.710 --> 37:25.802
SHE BANGED HER HEAD.

37:25.840 --> 37:26.864
SHE DIED.

37:26.910 --> 37:29.572
- CATHERINE?

37:29.610 --> 37:32.374
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.412
- YOU PUSHED HER DOWN.

37:34.450 --> 37:35.576
SHE BANGED HER HEAD.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.417
- SHAWN.

37:37.450 --> 37:41.045
A COMMON SIDE EFFECT OF SEVERE
LIVER FAILURE IS PSYCHOSIS.

37:41.090 --> 37:44.548
SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING.

37:44.590 --> 37:48.651
- [sobbing]

37:53.330 --> 37:55.560
- I OWE YOU HUGE.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.488
NO, I MEAN HUGE, SHAWN.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.303
AND AS A TOKEN
OF MY APPRECIATION,

37:59.340 --> 38:01.331
I'M GONNA LOAN OUT CURT SMITH
FOR YOUR BUDDY'S WEDDING.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.972
- WHAT?
NOW DON'T PLAY WITH ME.

38:03.010 --> 38:04.807
- FAIR WARNING THOUGH.
HE'S AN ANGRY DRUNK.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.806
I MEAN, WHO THROWS
A KEYTAR INTO A JACUZZI?

38:06.850 --> 38:08.317
- OH, THAT'S MONEY.

38:08.350 --> 38:09.874
- LISTEN.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.343
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT JULIET,

38:12.390 --> 38:15.314
AND IT'S SILLY FOR ANYONE
TO KEEP A GIANT SECRET

38:15.360 --> 38:17.055
ABOUT THEMSELVES FROM SOMEONE
THEY COULD POTENTIALLY

38:17.090 --> 38:18.489
FALL FOR, YOU KNOW?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.851
- I DO, ACTUALLY.

38:20.890 --> 38:23.688
- SO I'M GONNA COME CLEAN.
- REALLY?

38:23.730 --> 38:26.096
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING ABOUT
DOING THE SAME THING.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.098
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

38:28.130 --> 38:30.997
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE IT'S TIME.

38:31.040 --> 38:34.703
- TIME FOR WHAT?

38:34.740 --> 38:39.609
- JULES.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.914
UH...

38:41.950 --> 38:46.011
HERE'S THE THING.

38:46.050 --> 38:48.416
[sighs]

38:48.460 --> 38:50.951
WILL YOU TAKE A WALK WITH ME?

38:50.990 --> 38:53.982
CAN YOU GIVE US A SEC?

38:54.030 --> 38:55.998
- I'M A FRAUD.

38:56.030 --> 38:58.624
- WHAT?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.764
- I DON'T HAVE ANY, UH,

39:01.800 --> 39:03.734
FANCY DEGREES FROM HARVARD

39:03.770 --> 39:06.739
OR YEARS OF EXPERIENCE
AS A PROFILER.

39:06.770 --> 39:09.477
I'M JUST A GUY WITH A LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY

39:09.510 --> 39:12.104
AND A LOVE FOR CATCHING
BAD GUYS.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.106
THIS WHOLE PERSONA I'VE
BEEN PUTTING ON IS JUST--

39:14.150 --> 39:15.139
IT'S A COMPLETE FAKE
AND I JUST THOUGHT

39:15.180 --> 39:16.647
IT WAS IMPORTANT
TO TELL YOU THIS,

39:16.680 --> 39:18.079
'CAUSE YOU STRIKE ME
AS THE KIND OF PERSON

39:18.120 --> 39:19.712
WHO APPRECIATES HON ESTY.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.809
- WOW.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.111
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

39:23.160 --> 39:28.086
- WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.896
OR NOT.

39:31.930 --> 39:35.468
WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO VERY WELL,
DID IT, SHAWN?

39:35.500 --> 39:37.058
- SHH.
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND, DECK.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.933
LET ME JUST--ONE SECOND
HERE AND...

39:39.970 --> 39:41.608
DONE.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.005
THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE FIRST TIME

39:43.040 --> 39:44.746
THAT I'M GLAD YOU
BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.099
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH, MAN.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.846
- WELL, YOU'LL GET OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK TO HER.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.768
ME?
NOT SO MUCH.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.744
- LISTEN, DECLAN...

39:53.790 --> 39:55.587
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.851
THERE'S NOTHING I VALUE
MORE THAN HONESTY

39:58.890 --> 40:02.121
AND IT DOES REALLY BOTHER ME
THAT YOU WOULD LIE LIKE THAT,

40:02.160 --> 40:05.789
BUT I'M ALSO JUST BLOWN AWAY
THAT YOU COULD BE

40:05.830 --> 40:08.435
JUST SO FORTHCOMING.

40:08.470 --> 40:10.768
TOOK A LOT OF GUTS.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.734
- SHOULD WE TALK IT OUT
OVER COFFEE?

40:12.770 --> 40:14.203
- I DON'T THINK SO.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.504
- SURE.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.509
BUT IF YOU'RE SITTING
ON ANY OTHER LIFE SECRETS,

40:19.550 --> 40:21.438
NOW IS THE TIME TO TELL ME.

40:21.480 --> 40:26.816
- OKAY.

40:26.850 --> 40:30.058
I'M REALLY RICH.

40:30.090 --> 40:33.423
- OKAY, I CAN DEAL WITH THAT.

40:39.230 --> 40:41.425
[cell phone vibrates]

40:52.810 --> 40:57.042
- * SO GLAD WE'VE
ALMOST MADE IT *

40:57.080 --> 40:59.810
* $0--

41:03.890 --> 41:05.824
- WOW.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.851
CURT'S REALLY LOSING IT.

41:07.890 --> 41:10.222
- * BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

41:10.260 --> 41:14.765
* WANTS TO RULE THE...

41:14.800 --> 41:18.167
* WORLD

41:18.200 --> 41:19.667
- GUS, THERE YOU ARE.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.063
YOU MISSED THE ENTIRE CEREMONY.

41:21.110 --> 41:22.702
WHERE'S KIM?

41:22.740 --> 41:23.729
- MAN, WE BROKE UP.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.270
- WHAT?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

41:25.310 --> 41:26.675
WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.972
WE WERE OUT HAVING
A NICE LUNCH TODAY,

41:28.010 --> 41:29.272
WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE SHE GOES,

41:29.320 --> 41:30.810
"IT'S LIKE WE DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER ANYMORE."

41:30.850 --> 41:33.216
- THAT'S BECAUSE AS
OF A WEEK AGO, YOU DIDN'T.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.558
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.

41:34.590 --> 41:35.682
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SINGLE AGAIN.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.709
- YOU KNOW WHO CAN?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.284
ANYONE WHO MET YOU
EIGHT DAYS AGO.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.254
- HOW ABOUT SHOWING SOME
COMPASSION, SHAWN?

41:40.290 --> 41:41.848
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THAT WHOLE THING WAS ABSURD.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.197
YOU'RE A RIDICULOUS PERSON.

41:43.230 --> 41:45.767
- YOU'RE A RIDICULOUS PERSON.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

41:45.800 --> 41:46.926
WHAT'S THE LATEST WITH GINA?

41:46.970 --> 41:48.597
HAS SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU YET

41:48.640 --> 41:49.436
FOR UNINVITING HER
TO THIS WEDDING?

41:49.470 --> 41:52.132
- NO, BECAUSE I CAME UP
WITH A FIX.

41:52.170 --> 41:53.762
- THIS BUFFET IS SO GOOD.

41:53.810 --> 41:54.834
HI, GUS.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.074
- HELLO, GINA.

41:56.110 --> 41:57.771
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.
- HELP ME.

41:57.810 --> 41:59.949
- YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE
BRUSCHETTA, SHAWN, SERIOUSLY.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.868
- I'D REALLY PREFER NOT TO.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.547
- OH, WELL, THEN I'LL BE
THE ONLY ONE WITH GARLIC BREATH

42:03.580 --> 42:05.286
AND IT'LL BE REALLY GROSS
WHEN WE MAKE OUT LATER.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.117
- YES, IT WILL.

42:07.150 --> 42:10.654
- MMM.

42:10.690 --> 42:11.884
- OH.

42:11.930 --> 42:13.022
OH!

42:13.060 --> 42:16.223
- * HE HAD A GIFT INVOLVING

42:16.260 --> 42:19.195
* PROBLEM SOLVING

42:19.230 --> 42:20.197
* NEVER BACKING DOWN

42:20.230 --> 42:21.697
- IT'S REALLY GARLIC-Y.
UGH!
