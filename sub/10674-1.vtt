worked and beat to the bone.

that you have for your child.

- Hell,

24:44.094 --> 24:45.177
more than I can count.

24:45.229 --> 24:47.179
Well, my guess, at least 600.

24:47.181 --> 24:51.016
On foot, there is not a man
on earth who could make that.

24:51.068 --> 24:53.819
Especially not being hunted
by those whose sole aim

24:53.854 --> 24:57.189
is to drag him back in chains,
dead or alive. Add to that,

24:57.241 --> 24:58.690
there isn't anywhere to hide

24:58.742 --> 25:01.276

20 years I've been the master
of this plantation,

25:29.330 --> 25:31.306
and I have not had

25:31.358 --> 25:32.998
one runaway.

25:33.861 --> 25:35.416
Not one.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.529

25:39.283 --> 25:41.045

39:01.117 --> 39:04.335
I gave 'em the sugar...
that's got 'em running wild.

39:04.370 --> 39:08.039
If anybody gonna be punished,
it's gonna be me.

39:08.041 --> 39:09.540
(crying): Please...

39:09.542 --> 39:12.593
So that's how they do it up
in the big house, is it?

39:12.628 --> 39:14.428
You just talk to me

39:14.464 --> 39:16.297
- any way you want?
- N-No, sir.

39:16.349 --> 39:18.033
Come down here and tell me how
it's gonna be?!

39:18.058 --> 39:18.849
No, no, sir.

39:18.885 --> 39:21.052
He a little boy, sir. He's a little boy.

39:21.721 --> 39:22.887

(quietly): You must be crazy.

43:07.496 --> 43:09.196
- You tryin' to get us killed.
- MOSES: The Lord saw fit

43:09.248 --> 43:10.831
to show you mercy after you was

43:10.866 --> 43:12.499
dragged back here, and now you talkin'

43:12.535 --> 43:14.118
- like this.
- I wasn't tryin' to run.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.370
I was just tryin' to get into the city.

43:16.422 --> 43:19.373
Find a connection to the freedom train.

43:19.425 --> 43:21.508
All right, I need you
to tell me what this say.

43:21.544 --> 43:23.377
Now I know you crazy.
Massa see you with somethin'

43:23.429 --> 43:25.462
with words on it,
he gonna have your back peeled.

43:25.464 --> 43:27.431
I don't know who told you's
I could read,

43:27.466 --> 43:28.849
but they's mistaken.

43:28.884 --> 43:32.970
I thought God ain't take kindly
to tellin' lies.

43:32.972 --> 43:35.306
(grunts)

43:35.358 --> 43:38.309
I ain't gonna tell nobody.
Now, this is the map to freedom.

43:38.361 --> 43:41.312
I'm trustin' you with it.
You got to trust me, too.

43:41.364 --> 43:43.647
Okay, we all got to trust
each other. This whole thing,

43:43.649 --> 43:44.732
it don't work no other way.

43:44.784 --> 43:46.150
Oh, no. It don't work any which way.

43:46.202 --> 43:48.819
That's what they want you to
think, but we do this right,

43:48.821 --> 43:53.490
we do this together,
we can stand as free men.

43:56.662 --> 43:58.796
Ugly death.

44:00.666 --> 44:04.301
That's the only thing
we gonna find we stay here.

44:04.337 --> 44:06.420
S-Slip it to me.

44:06.472 --> 44:09.056
I see what it say back at my cabin.

44:11.510 --> 44:13.644
TOM: <i>You're not doing much talking</i>

44:13.679 --> 44:15.354
tonight.

44:16.515 --> 44:19.183
Having a hard time
opening up a conversation

44:19.185 --> 44:20.768
with your fellow slave owners.

44:20.820 --> 44:23.320
Well, it's all the more reason I
appreciate you making the trip.

44:23.356 --> 44:26.106
Mary's birthday isn't
a matter of politics.

44:26.158 --> 44:27.908
It's a matter of family.

44:27.943 --> 44:29.777
I, uh, couldn't help but notice
you and the wife

44:29.829 --> 44:31.174
weren't doing much talking either.

44:32.288 --> 44:34.031
You ever say something so reprehensible

44:34.083 --> 44:36.116
that you can't possibly take it back?

44:36.923 --> 44:40.120
Why do you think I own
so many acres of land?

44:40.172 --> 44:43.207
More places to hide. (chuckles)

44:43.209 --> 44:44.925
I love that accent
you've adopted, by the way.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.827
(chuckles) Mmm. Mm-hmm.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.097
I'm just trying to embrace the culture.

44:50.132 --> 44:52.766
Is that part of it? The bid for senator?

44:52.802 --> 44:54.218
Show 'em that you're one of them?

44:54.270 --> 44:55.686
They know I ain't one of 'em.

44:55.721 --> 44:57.021
That's why the Democrats approached me.

44:57.056 --> 44:59.448
They think I can speak
the language of the North.

45:00.496 --> 45:02.145
I hope I still can.

45:02.561 --> 45:04.028
Who's your campaign manager?

45:04.063 --> 45:06.113
- Smartest guy I know.
- Good. What's his name?

45:06.148 --> 45:08.148
John Hawkes.

45:09.819 --> 45:12.870
- (indistinct chatter)
- (chuckles)

45:12.905 --> 45:15.539
You have outdone yourself
tonight, Suzanna.

45:15.574 --> 45:17.491
They're gonna be talking about this one

45:17.543 --> 45:20.160
- for the rest of the year.
- It's not a competition.

45:20.212 --> 45:24.415
Says the woman who always wins.
(chuckling)

45:24.417 --> 45:27.751
Elizabeth, tell us about
the weather up north.

45:27.803 --> 45:30.313
Do y'all get anything like this heat?

45:31.608 --> 45:32.589
Elizabeth.

45:33.255 --> 45:36.760
Bernadette was asking
about the weather up north.

45:36.812 --> 45:39.396
Right. Um, yeah,
it d... it does get hot.

45:39.432 --> 45:40.731
But nothing like this.

45:40.766 --> 45:43.489
It's a bit, um... oppressive.

45:45.154 --> 45:48.439
Is your husband a planter
like his brother?

45:48.441 --> 45:51.442
No, no. John operates
a law practice in the city.

45:51.444 --> 45:53.327
He's also quite the activist.

45:53.362 --> 45:56.029
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- For what cause?

45:56.082 --> 45:57.781
Rights for niggers.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.838
I try not to talk politics
at social occasions.

46:01.890 --> 46:03.587
That's amusing, because I feel

46:03.622 --> 46:05.873
like all you Northerners do is talk.

46:05.925 --> 46:07.841
We're the ones down here
doing all the work

46:07.877 --> 46:09.460
to keep the economy going.

46:09.512 --> 46:11.295
(Elizabeth laughs softly)

46:11.347 --> 46:13.630
This cake is delicious.

46:13.632 --> 46:16.049
Did you make it yourself?

46:17.574 --> 46:21.138
I guess it's easy to be a woman
of ideals, given your...

46:21.173 --> 46:22.573
condition.

46:22.608 --> 46:24.808
And I promise you this.

46:24.810 --> 46:26.894
You and John will both
feel differently on the matter

46:26.946 --> 46:27.945
if you ever

46:27.980 --> 46:30.364
- have children.
- Now, I simply

46:30.399 --> 46:33.117
must show you ladies
where the nursery will be.

46:33.152 --> 46:35.569
Come. This way.

46:41.660 --> 46:44.661
(indistinct chatter)

46:54.507 --> 46:56.673
(owl hooting)

46:57.510 --> 47:00.894
(exhales)

47:00.930 --> 47:03.063
(sniffles)

47:05.851 --> 47:07.985
(exhales)

47:10.239 --> 47:12.356
(sniffles)

47:19.281 --> 47:21.281
That was-was real good of you

47:21.333 --> 47:23.813
to take them lashes for your brother.

47:28.424 --> 47:30.664
You says we all pretendin'.

47:32.959 --> 47:34.456
What'd you mean?

47:35.798 --> 47:39.132
We's all know we supposed to be free.

47:40.686 --> 47:45.431
I ain't been more than two steps
off this plantation in my life.

47:46.141 --> 47:49.047
Can't even imagine
what being free would be like.

47:51.780 --> 47:55.672
All them cities up north, they
all built of iron and steel.

47:56.285 --> 47:58.869
A free man, say with the skills I got,

47:58.904 --> 48:01.384
oh, he could live like a king.

48:02.374 --> 48:05.087
Go anywhere his heart desires.

48:05.494 --> 48:08.441
Live a life is his own
and no one else's.

48:08.831 --> 48:11.081
Except his wife, when he finds her.

48:12.251 --> 48:14.064
And they children?

48:14.837 --> 48:17.472
They ain't never gonna have
to think about runnin'.

48:25.931 --> 48:28.065
(footsteps approaching)

48:43.532 --> 48:46.617
Did you have a chance
to taste the peacock?

48:46.669 --> 48:48.035
(chuckles)

48:48.087 --> 48:50.037
No, I have had a scotch in my hand

48:50.089 --> 48:53.257
since we stepped off the stagecoach.

48:55.044 --> 48:58.519
I didn't drink nearly enough
to forget what I said to you.

48:59.131 --> 49:00.514
You're right.

49:00.549 --> 49:03.598
I need to start putting
our family first.

49:09.441 --> 49:12.286
Tom asked me to manage his campaign.

49:14.313 --> 49:16.647
If I want to make a difference,
a real one,

49:16.699 --> 49:20.076
then having the ears
of a senator could help.

49:20.903 --> 49:23.029
We'd have to move down here.

49:23.989 --> 49:27.422
But I'd be home more and
we'd be surrounded by family

49:28.789 --> 49:30.360
for when we have our own.

49:39.838 --> 49:41.897
It's me.

49:43.142 --> 49:46.265
I'm the reason that we
can't have children.

49:49.231 --> 49:50.229
Oh.

49:51.850 --> 49:56.269
They had a little boy up in a swing,

49:56.322 --> 49:59.523
and he was... fanning us in the parlor

49:59.525 --> 50:02.242
like he was just another
piece of the furniture.

50:02.745 --> 50:05.306
And no one cared.

50:11.086 --> 50:12.498
This...

50:13.835 --> 50:15.005
this isn't the kind of world

50:15.040 --> 50:17.371
that I want to bring children into.

50:21.046 --> 50:23.003
We have to change that.

50:26.146 --> 50:28.769
That's five dollars
from the Macon plantation.

50:28.804 --> 50:31.271
And here's $50 for the one
from Alabama way.

50:31.306 --> 50:32.389
Hold on now.

50:32.391 --> 50:34.891
The notice says $100, dead or alive.

50:34.893 --> 50:35.942
That's for the pair.

50:35.978 --> 50:38.445
- Male and female.
- That bitch?

50:38.480 --> 50:39.896
We done chased her over a cliff.
She fell.

50:39.898 --> 50:41.398
Must've been 50 feet.

50:41.450 --> 50:42.616
- Is that so?
- I reckon

50:42.651 --> 50:43.900
it could've been 75.

50:43.952 --> 50:45.619
Ain't no way to get that body.

50:45.654 --> 50:47.988
(chuckles) Well, the good Lord must
have been looking out for her,

50:48.040 --> 50:50.957
'cause she ended up in here
without a scratch on her.

50:50.993 --> 50:53.076
Rest of this money goes
to the slave catcher

50:53.078 --> 50:55.912
- who brought her in.
- JIM: And who's that, exactly?

50:55.914 --> 50:58.278
That'd be me, Jim.

50:59.501 --> 51:01.918
JIM: You stole her right from under us.

51:01.970 --> 51:03.804
CONSTABLE: Y'all ain't
the only ones tricked.

51:03.839 --> 51:06.590
He walked her right in here
with his coat over her head.

51:06.642 --> 51:08.892
I swear I heard her call him a saint.

51:08.927 --> 51:10.127
That true?

51:11.013 --> 51:12.814
Not at all.

51:13.399 --> 51:15.710
She called me an angel.

51:43.524 --> 51:44.845
We left off

51:44.880 --> 51:47.514
John 15:13. I got somethin' else

51:47.549 --> 51:49.287
I want you to read me tonight.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.261
Where'd you get this?

51:54.263 --> 51:55.605
Noah.

51:55.641 --> 51:57.641
He think I'm the one that can read.

51:57.693 --> 51:59.294
It's a song.

52:00.764 --> 52:03.936
My mama used to sing it to me
when I was no older than Boo.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.038
Some of the words are different.

52:07.569 --> 52:11.135
Yeah. Noah reckons
