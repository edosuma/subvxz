WEBVTT

00:00.554 --> 00:02.749
Do not try what you're
about to see at home.

00:02.822 --> 00:05.723
We consult with experts.
We take every precaution.

00:05.792 --> 00:09.818
And we have years of experience
in dangerous situations.

00:11.398 --> 00:14.799
On this daredevil
episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:14.868 --> 00:16.199
Okay, go.

00:16.268 --> 00:18.499
<i>...Adam and Jamie get a grip...</i>

00:18.572 --> 00:21.973
I think I had a nightmare
just like this once.

00:22.042 --> 00:24.169
<i>...as they test
that old movie myth...</i>

00:24.244 --> 00:27.179
can you cling to a moving car?

00:27.247 --> 00:28.839
Come on, give it to me!

00:28.915 --> 00:31.440
<i>Then Kari, Tory, and Grant...</i>

00:31.518 --> 00:32.644
Lock down number three!

00:32.719 --> 00:35.950
<i>...break out
more liberating jailbreak myths.</i>

00:36.022 --> 00:36.954
Son of a

00:37.023 --> 00:39.218
<i>Can you floss yourself
to freedom...</i>

00:39.292 --> 00:41.351
Let's see you
get out of this one.

00:41.428 --> 00:42.360
Whoo-hoo!

00:42.429 --> 00:44.590
<i>...or shoot yourself
from servitude...</i>

00:44.664 --> 00:46.598
This is my favorite part.
I'm not gonna lie.

00:46.666 --> 00:49.499
<i>...with a cannon
and a ball and chain?</i>

00:51.504 --> 00:52.937
That was cool!

00:56.710 --> 00:58.871
<i>Who are the Mythbusters?</i>

00:59.713 --> 01:02.011
- Adam Savage...
- That's significant data.

01:02.082 --> 01:03.071
<i>...and Jamie Hyneman.</i>

01:03.149 --> 01:05.242
I think we're gonna
set something on fire.

01:05.952 --> 01:07.977
<i>Between them, more than 30 years</i>

01:08.054 --> 01:09.919
of special-effects experience.

01:11.091 --> 01:14.185
Joining them... Grant Imahara...

01:14.261 --> 01:15.728
Freedom!

01:15.795 --> 01:17.160
<i>...Tory Belleci...</i>

01:17.230 --> 01:19.289
I don't think this one's
gonna work. It's just too big.

01:19.366 --> 01:20.492
<i>...and Kari Byron.</i>

01:20.567 --> 01:21.625
I'm starting to get the idea

01:21.701 --> 01:22.963
that this
shouldn't be done inside.

01:23.036 --> 01:25.869
<i>They don't just tell the myths.</i>

01:25.939 --> 01:28.407
They put them to the test.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.758 --> 01:46.089
Why are you working out?

01:46.159 --> 01:47.751
Ohh, our next myth, man.

01:47.827 --> 01:50.057
We're gonna need all
the arm strength we can get.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.290
Why is that?

01:51.364 --> 01:54.026
Ah, it's a classic
Hollywood-action-movie staple...

01:54.100 --> 01:56.534
the car-roof cling.

01:56.603 --> 01:58.798
Oh, you mean where somebody
jumps on top of a car

01:58.872 --> 02:00.362
and tries to hang on
while it's driving?

02:00.440 --> 02:03.034
Yeah, but the driver
is trying everything he can

02:03.109 --> 02:04.167
to shake him off.

02:05.912 --> 02:09.404
<i>Getting a grip has
been the speciality of stunt men</i>

02:09.482 --> 02:11.780
since motors and movies
first teamed up.

02:11.851 --> 02:13.546
But in reality,

02:13.620 --> 02:17.681
is clinging on to a wild ride
really plain sailing?

02:17.757 --> 02:19.816
You know, hanging on to a car
is one thing,

02:19.893 --> 02:22.885
but falling off,
we could get seriously hurt.

02:22.962 --> 02:24.327
Yeah, I've been
thinking that, too.

02:24.397 --> 02:26.831
That's why I've been picturing
in my mind

02:26.900 --> 02:29.630
a crane arm that would come out
of the trunk of a car

02:29.703 --> 02:31.193
and go over the top of it.

02:31.271 --> 02:32.966
Then we could tie into it,
and that would allow us

02:33.039 --> 02:36.270
to show one of us losing his
grip, but not losing his life.

02:36.343 --> 02:38.311
Exactly, and I think
we should make it long enough

02:38.378 --> 02:39.868
not only to test
holding on to the roof,

02:39.946 --> 02:42.107
but also being able
to hold on to the hood.

02:42.182 --> 02:43.308
Well, we can build it,

02:43.383 --> 02:45.112
but we'll have to do
a thorough job of it,

02:45.185 --> 02:46.812
'cause our lives
are gonna depend on it.

02:46.886 --> 02:48.547
They will.

02:49.789 --> 02:52.724
So, if you're a stunt man in
Hollywood and you're holding on

02:52.792 --> 02:54.817
to the roof of a car
like this while it's driving,

02:54.894 --> 02:56.953
chances are
you're wearing a harness

02:57.030 --> 02:58.361
that tethers you to the car.

02:58.431 --> 03:00.524
Similarly,
if you're on the hood,

03:00.600 --> 03:01.965
you're also wearing
that kind of system.

03:02.035 --> 03:03.400
This isn't gonna work for us,

03:03.470 --> 03:06.837
because Jamie is gonna try
and shake me off of this car,

03:06.906 --> 03:09.170
and it's got to be demonstrable

03:09.242 --> 03:11.107
that I'm being shaken
off the car

03:11.177 --> 03:13.202
without letting me
hit the ground,

03:13.279 --> 03:15.941
which tells me that some kind of
cable tether isn't good enough.

03:16.015 --> 03:17.710
My legs could slip over
and hit the ground.

03:17.784 --> 03:20.309
There's a lot of problems with
that from a safety standpoint.

03:20.387 --> 03:23.015
<i>And in theory,
their overhead crane idea</i>

03:23.089 --> 03:25.057
should overcome those problems.

03:25.125 --> 03:28.219
But in practice, the boys
are baffled at how to build it.

03:28.294 --> 03:29.921
Um...

03:29.996 --> 03:32.829
<i>So, cue the brainstorm.</i>

03:32.899 --> 03:34.662
Shatter out this back window.

03:34.734 --> 03:38.761
Get away with using
a counter spring of some sort.

03:38.838 --> 03:40.806
It's gonna be like
a double-masted thing.

03:40.874 --> 03:42.171
And that's all
that additional weight

03:42.242 --> 03:44.142
that we don't need up high.

03:44.210 --> 03:48.237
If it does fail, whoever is
up there, we're in deep trouble.

03:48.314 --> 03:51.044
<i>After a frightening
two hours of back-and-forth...</i>

03:51.117 --> 03:52.175
Okay.

03:52.252 --> 03:54.652
<i>...the Mythbusters
finally have a plan.</i>

03:54.721 --> 03:55.949
Okay, good.
I like that.

03:56.022 --> 03:57.455
Yeah, it looks good.

03:57.524 --> 04:00.493
<i>A plan that's
all about junk in the trunk.</i>

04:00.560 --> 04:03.393
They're going to cut into
the trunk to get to the frame.

04:03.463 --> 04:05.556
To this they'll weld
a steel tower

04:05.632 --> 04:07.998
that they'll attach
to a crane beam.

04:08.067 --> 04:11.230
The crane beam will link
to a safety-harness T-bar

04:11.304 --> 04:15.240
that they'll clip into while
holding the roof and the hood.

04:15.308 --> 04:17.367
Attention, former car.

04:17.444 --> 04:19.503
Prepare to be modified.

04:19.579 --> 04:21.444
Resistance is futile.

04:22.615 --> 04:23.775
<i>Ain't that the truth,</i>

04:23.850 --> 04:27.286
especially because there's
a savage Savage on the loose.

04:28.788 --> 04:30.312
This used to be a car, right?

04:30.390 --> 04:32.688
A few minutes ago, even.

04:32.759 --> 04:34.317
<i>With the car frame exposed</i>

04:34.394 --> 04:37.852
and the trunk tower support
system time-lapsed into place,

04:37.931 --> 04:40.695
next the boys strain
with the crane.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.428
When you just heard the V.O. guy

04:42.502 --> 04:43.867
saying we were straining
with the crane,

04:43.937 --> 04:45.768
I want to point out
that's not entirely true.

04:45.839 --> 04:47.739
This is not a crane part
we're using.

04:47.807 --> 04:50.105
It's triangular antenna truss,

04:50.176 --> 04:52.303
used in radio towers
and stuff like that.

04:52.378 --> 04:53.606
But the reason we're using it

04:53.680 --> 04:56.911
is because its triangular
structure, just like in a crane,

04:56.983 --> 04:59.508
affords it a tremendous amount
of lateral strength.

05:00.220 --> 05:02.120
<i>So tremendous that it's ideal</i>

05:02.188 --> 05:04.748
for supporting the weight
of the odd Mythbuster.

05:04.824 --> 05:06.621
Okay.
Well, that works for me.

05:06.693 --> 05:08.388
<i>And it better work
for Adam, too,</i>

05:08.461 --> 05:10.588
because it's this T-bar
that will literally hold

05:10.663 --> 05:13.928
the Mythbusters
hanging by a thread.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.695
The rig is almost done,

05:15.768 --> 05:20.637
but still it lacks that visual
punch that I'm looking for.

05:20.707 --> 05:22.538
I'm about to add it.

05:24.911 --> 05:27.209
<i>With a fresh coat
of high-speed pink,</i>

05:27.280 --> 05:29.475
the cling-on car rig
is ready to roll.

05:32.585 --> 05:35.418
But, uh, Houston,
we have a problem.

05:36.689 --> 05:40.625
Well, unfortunately,
the car won't start.

05:40.693 --> 05:43.719
Adam was really quick
with cutting this all apart,

05:43.796 --> 05:46.321
but maybe he was
a little too quick.

05:46.399 --> 05:47.593
At this point it looks like Adam

05:47.667 --> 05:49.635
cut the electrical power
to the fuel pump,

05:49.702 --> 05:52.933
so we can find that wire
and hook it up again,

05:53.006 --> 05:55.372
then we'll be back in business.

05:55.441 --> 05:56.373
It's always something.

05:56.442 --> 05:58.569
<i>But after a bit of hot-wiring...</i>

06:00.146 --> 06:03.343
...the guys are revved up
and ready for the test track...

06:04.951 --> 06:08.216
<i>...and what could be
the ride of their lives.</i>

06:16.362 --> 06:18.557
All right, so what's up
with the convict suits again?

06:18.631 --> 06:20.223
Have your shady pasts
caught up with you?

06:20.300 --> 06:21.597
Well, actually, yes.

06:21.668 --> 06:24.228
Remember a few months back when
we devoted an entire episode

06:24.304 --> 06:26.238
to prison-break myths,
and we rappelled down a wall

06:26.306 --> 06:29.036
using bedsheets,
toilet paper, and hair?

06:29.108 --> 06:30.541
Of course.
And we escaped.

06:30.610 --> 06:32.942
Yeah, well, the trouble is,
the fans want more.

06:33.012 --> 06:35.105
Ever since that episode,
we've been inundated

06:35.181 --> 06:37.274
with ideas
for new prison-break myths.

06:37.350 --> 06:39.181
Are you sure these are fans
and not prisoners

06:39.252 --> 06:40.480
sending in these requests?

06:40.553 --> 06:42.350
We're bustin' out of here, see?

06:42.422 --> 06:44.117
<i>Yep, in one of the all-time</i>

06:44.190 --> 06:46.750
most memorable
mythbusting moments,

06:46.826 --> 06:48.418
ropes made of bedsheets...

06:48.494 --> 06:49.722
God!

06:49.796 --> 06:50.785
<i>...human hair...</i>

06:50.863 --> 06:52.296
I see split ends.

06:52.365 --> 06:53.559
<i>...and toilet paper</i>

06:53.633 --> 06:57.694
successfully aided and abetted
a 14-story prison break.

06:57.770 --> 07:00.466
Freedom!

07:00.540 --> 07:02.030
All right,
so what's up this time?

07:02.108 --> 07:02.972
Well, two things.

07:03.042 --> 07:06.068
First of all, the fans think
that you can escape from prison

07:06.145 --> 07:08.773
using a little muscle
and a lot of this.

07:08.848 --> 07:09.610
What?

07:09.682 --> 07:11.309
Yeah, they reckon
you can cut through the bars

07:11.384 --> 07:12.442
using dental floss.

07:12.518 --> 07:13.780
All right.
What else?

07:13.853 --> 07:15.753
Well, the other one's
a little bit higher octane.

07:15.822 --> 07:17.551
Supposedly back in the day,

07:17.624 --> 07:21.025
a prisoner took the ball from
his old-timey ball and chain,

07:21.094 --> 07:23.790
put it in the prison's
ceremonial cannon,

07:23.863 --> 07:26.957
and launched himself
over the fence to freedom.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.002
<i>But first up
is the fan-fueled fable</i>

07:30.069 --> 07:32.970
that flossing can set you free.

07:33.039 --> 07:34.404
And back at the big house...

07:34.474 --> 07:36.669
Alameda County
Courthouse Jail...

07:36.743 --> 07:38.005
Hey, Uncle Billy!

07:38.077 --> 07:39.840
<i>...some of the team
are about to get</i>

07:39.912 --> 07:42.312
an inside look at the myth.

07:42.382 --> 07:44.373
Lock down number three!

07:44.450 --> 07:47.510
You...
You did!

07:47.587 --> 07:48.645
There you go.

07:48.721 --> 07:50.086
There's some dental floss.

07:50.156 --> 07:51.851
I'm gonna go talk to J. D.

07:51.924 --> 07:53.619
Good luck getting out
of this jail cell.

07:53.693 --> 07:54.955
Dude, is this really locked?

07:55.028 --> 07:56.256
Dead man walking!

07:56.329 --> 07:57.489
That's really locked!

07:57.563 --> 08:00.691
<i>So while our duo
of desperate dental hygienists</i>

08:00.767 --> 08:02.359
attempt to break out...

08:02.435 --> 08:05.700
Oh, look.
I removed some plaque.

08:05.772 --> 08:07.637
<i>...Tory gets some inside info</i>

08:07.707 --> 08:11.040
from friend of the show
Sergeant J. D. Nelson.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.338
So, have you ever
heard of this myth...

08:12.412 --> 08:15.074
using dental floss
to cut through a jail bar?

08:15.148 --> 08:16.740
Well, I think that'd
be pretty difficult

08:16.816 --> 08:19.341
just because dental floss
doesn't have a lot of grit.

08:19.419 --> 08:22.013
But given enough time,
I guess anything is possible.

08:22.088 --> 08:23.316
What do you think of this?

08:23.389 --> 08:26.916
There's silica in most
tooth-whitening toothpastes.

08:26.993 --> 08:29.154
We could use it as an abrasive.

08:29.228 --> 08:31.753
- Oh, yeah, a little bit extra...
- Yeah.

08:31.831 --> 08:34.823
- ... to accelerate the process.
- Yeah.

08:34.900 --> 08:38.496
<i>That abrasive silica,
or sand, as many of us know it,</i>

08:38.571 --> 08:42.631
is a grinding agent used
to remove those stubborn stains.

08:42.708 --> 08:47.169
But will it remove
those stubborn steel bars?

08:48.347 --> 08:49.939
Hey!
Knock that off.

08:50.016 --> 08:50.983
Troublemakers.

08:51.050 --> 08:53.712
We're gonna have to keep them
locked up for a long time.

08:53.786 --> 08:56.254
<i>After two hours of hard labor,</i>

08:56.322 --> 08:58.381
one thing has become
very clear...

08:58.458 --> 09:03.555
testing the myth manually is not
feasible in the time available.

09:03.629 --> 09:05.654
Made it through the paint,

09:05.732 --> 09:09.327
but fortunately,
I have a secret weapon.

09:09.402 --> 09:12.394
And it could have something to
do with special robot knowledge.

09:12.472 --> 09:14.770
<i>So, they're going to
head back to the shop,</i>

09:14.841 --> 09:17.537
where Grant, staying true
to the spirit of the myth,

09:17.610 --> 09:21.171
wants to use only materials
he could find on the inside.

09:21.247 --> 09:23.875
She's out of control.
She's out of control!

09:23.950 --> 09:27.113
So, trying to free ourselves
using dental floss,

09:27.186 --> 09:29.746
flossing by hand,
didn't really work out.

09:29.822 --> 09:34.225
But fortunately, I have a backup
plan, and it involves this.

09:34.293 --> 09:38.525
This is your average, everyday
cassette recorder/player,

09:38.598 --> 09:40.498
which I have stolen.

09:40.566 --> 09:44.525
I'm going to use this to make a
machine that will floss for me.

09:44.604 --> 09:46.094
<i>So Grant goes to work,</i>

09:46.172 --> 09:48.140
turning
an old-school tape recorder

09:48.207 --> 09:50.835
into a dental-flossing robot...

09:50.910 --> 09:52.537
Easier than I thought.

09:52.612 --> 09:54.443
<i>...while Tory
builds the kind of jail</i>

09:54.514 --> 09:59.713
every inmate dreams of...
one with just one wall.

09:59.786 --> 10:01.515
Now, I know
this isn't a real jail,

10:01.587 --> 10:02.815
but I wasn't trying
to make a jail.

10:02.889 --> 10:04.481
But we needed something to test

10:04.557 --> 10:07.185
whether or not dental floss
could cut through a steel bar.

10:07.260 --> 10:08.284
So I made this.

10:08.361 --> 10:11.421
Let's see if Grant can floss
his way out of this one.

10:11.497 --> 10:13.829
So, my flossing robot
is finally complete.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.893
It incorporates the guts of a
standard cassette-tape recorder

10:17.970 --> 10:20.564
with a specially
modified cassette

10:20.640 --> 10:24.041
that contains, instead of tape,
dental floss.

10:24.110 --> 10:27.568
I'm gonna set this up
on the bars and go to it.

10:27.647 --> 10:30.207
But I'm also going to
incorporate Kari's idea,

10:30.283 --> 10:33.184
which is to put a little bit
of toothpaste on it

10:33.252 --> 10:35.720
to get that little extra bit
of abrasive.

10:35.788 --> 10:37.551
Here we go.

10:38.958 --> 10:40.926
Okay, so we've got a little jam.

10:40.993 --> 10:42.927
Already got
a little minor problem

10:42.995 --> 10:44.929
with the flossing machine.

10:44.997 --> 10:47.625
<i>So it's back
to the drawing board...</i>

10:47.700 --> 10:51.136
I've made a few changes
to the dental-floss machine.

10:51.204 --> 10:53.195
<i>...where Grant
throws everything he has</i>

10:53.272 --> 10:54.261
at the problem.

10:55.374 --> 10:56.898
<i>But after a full day's work</i>

10:56.976 --> 10:59.274
and several
failed prototypes...

10:59.345 --> 11:01.939
Hopefully,
the 27 th time is a charm.

11:02.014 --> 11:03.242
<i>...he throws the problem...</i>

11:04.817 --> 11:05.875
...at the wall.

11:05.952 --> 11:07.351
I don't think
this is gonna work.

11:11.991 --> 11:13.515
<i>The Mythbusters are testing</i>

11:13.593 --> 11:16.790
whether you can really cling
to a wild-ride car roof,

11:16.863 --> 11:19.388
as Hollywood
would have us believe.

11:19.465 --> 11:22.025
After all,
with a grip as strong as that,

11:22.101 --> 11:25.935
hanging on for dear life could
prove to be very doable indeed.

11:27.373 --> 11:29.000
And at the Alameda runway,

11:29.075 --> 11:32.875
it's time to put that theory
to the test.

11:32.945 --> 11:35.436
We've built a full-size rig
to hold on to us

11:35.514 --> 11:37.641
in case we can't hold on
to the car,

11:37.717 --> 11:39.685
and we've come out here
to the Alameda runway

11:39.752 --> 11:42.312
to test it full-scale.

11:42.388 --> 11:43.821
Yeah.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.924
<i>But before
trying to shake a Mythbuster,</i>

11:46.993 --> 11:48.722
the boys first
want to test the rig

11:48.794 --> 11:52.696
with someone
a little more, uh, expendable.

11:52.765 --> 11:55.563
So, currently Buster
is bolted into our safety rig

11:55.635 --> 11:56.932
for a stop test.

11:57.003 --> 11:58.800
It's a perfect opportunity
for me to show you

11:58.871 --> 12:01.032
how it ought to work.

12:01.107 --> 12:04.133
He's on a track
that runs fore and aft.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.973
Jamie is gonna run this car
up to speed,

12:06.045 --> 12:07.603
slam on the brakes
as hard as he can.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.843
At that point, Buster is gonna
slide all the way forward...

12:13.753 --> 12:15.084
...and stop.

12:15.154 --> 12:18.646
And hopefully, we're gonna learn
how safe this rig is to use

12:18.724 --> 12:20.988
by watching what happens
to poor Buster.

12:21.727 --> 12:23.217
<i>And unlike Adam or Jamie,</i>

12:23.296 --> 12:26.265
poor old Buster
won't be holding on at all.

12:26.332 --> 12:28.095
All right, Mr. Hyneman,
are you ready?

12:28.167 --> 12:29.031
I'm ready.

12:29.101 --> 12:33.538
Start your engine and begin
the untethered Buster stop test

12:33.606 --> 12:36.632
in 3, 2, 1.

12:36.709 --> 12:37.676
Go.

12:39.879 --> 12:42.939
<i>Jamie floors it
and takes the car up to 45</i>

12:43.015 --> 12:44.744
before slamming on the brakes.

12:49.188 --> 12:50.587
Uhh.

12:50.656 --> 12:52.487
<i>The good news is that the rig</i>

12:52.558 --> 12:54.856
did indeed hold Buster
off the tarmac.

12:54.927 --> 12:57.953
The bad news
is that pain-free it wasn't.

12:58.030 --> 12:59.998
Here's what scared me
about that test.

13:00.066 --> 13:01.431
This guy right here,

13:01.500 --> 13:04.628
he's made for firemen
to carry up and down stairs,

13:04.704 --> 13:06.968
to drop in burning,
smoky buildings.

13:07.039 --> 13:09.234
He's made to take
the kind of abuse you just saw

13:09.308 --> 13:10.297
and come back for more.

13:10.376 --> 13:13.140
He's engineered for that.
I'm not.

13:14.313 --> 13:17.043
<i>So nervous
are Adam and Jamie about safety</i>

13:17.116 --> 13:19.880
that they run Buster
through more tests.

13:19.952 --> 13:21.544
Go!

13:21.620 --> 13:24.054
<i>Brake tests...</i>

13:24.123 --> 13:25.454
...swerve tests...

13:28.160 --> 13:29.127
...curve tests,

13:29.195 --> 13:31.755
but none of it makes
for pleasant viewing,

13:31.831 --> 13:33.594
and that makes
what Adam is about to say

13:33.666 --> 13:35.031
all the more surprising.

13:35.101 --> 13:38.696
Well, from my perspective, that
test was lovely and successful,

13:38.771 --> 13:40.568
as far as the rig was concerned.

13:40.639 --> 13:42.539
We put
a huge amount of stress on it,

13:42.608 --> 13:43.734
and it was absolutely solid.

13:43.809 --> 13:47.301
I think that it's time
to give Jamie Buster's harness

13:47.380 --> 13:48.540
and strap him to the roof.

13:48.614 --> 13:51.549
<i>Yeah,
that rig is looking real good.</i>

13:51.617 --> 13:54.313
But Buster's
backbreaking performance

13:54.387 --> 13:58.050
is not filling
our next contestant with joy.

13:58.124 --> 14:01.025
If I can't hold on,
my big concern is,

14:01.093 --> 14:02.355
is it gonna keep me safe?

14:02.428 --> 14:04.055
I don't want to snap my neck

14:04.130 --> 14:05.825
when I reach the end
of my travel.

14:05.898 --> 14:08.992
So I'm gonna hold on real nice.

14:09.068 --> 14:10.831
<i>And real hard, Jamie,</i>

14:10.903 --> 14:14.737
because this myth
could get dangerously ugly.

14:18.978 --> 14:20.206
Lock down number three!

14:20.279 --> 14:21.541
<i>Kari, Grant, and Tory</i>

14:21.614 --> 14:24.014
are getting
positively penitentiary.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.778
All right, weapons check.

14:25.851 --> 14:28.649
Against the wall.
Go on. Come on.

14:30.056 --> 14:32.115
Okay, you're all right.

14:32.191 --> 14:33.488
What's this?

14:33.559 --> 14:35.049
Is this a file?

14:35.127 --> 14:36.424
Off to solitary confinement.

14:36.495 --> 14:37.894
You, to the yard.

14:39.231 --> 14:41.358
<i>Our fun-loving
criminals are testing to see</i>

14:41.434 --> 14:44.892
if they can free themselves
with floss.

14:47.139 --> 14:48.766
I don't think
this is gonna work.

14:48.841 --> 14:50.035
I think Grant's gone through

14:50.109 --> 14:52.009
like maybe 300 incarnations

14:52.078 --> 14:54.376
of his dental-floss
tape-recorder robot.

14:54.447 --> 14:56.142
They don't seem to be working.

14:56.215 --> 14:58.615
At least that's what I'm getting
from the throwing and swearing.

15:02.521 --> 15:04.921
All right,
so the tape recorder sucked.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.719
But it's gone.
It's history.

15:06.792 --> 15:10.193
Now I'm gonna ramp it up and use
whatever materials I want

15:10.262 --> 15:13.288
to make the ultimate automatic
dental-flossing machine.

15:13.365 --> 15:17.893
And then we'll see if it's
possible to floss through bars.

15:17.970 --> 15:19.870
<i>This time, Grant is unleashing</i>

15:19.939 --> 15:24.638
all his robot resources,
creating a tension system

15:24.710 --> 15:29.943
that will simulate the grip and
sawing action of a human being.

15:30.883 --> 15:33.579
Okay, so, the ultimate
dental-flossing robot

15:33.652 --> 15:34.744
is finished.

15:34.820 --> 15:36.845
Now it's time to give it a shot.

15:36.922 --> 15:39.720
And if this works,
it should go bzzz one way

15:39.792 --> 15:42.226
and bzzz the other way.

15:42.294 --> 15:46.253
<i>So, cue take two for
Grant and Kari's escape attempt.</i>

15:46.332 --> 15:48.266
You hear
that high-pitched sound?

15:48.334 --> 15:49.301
Uh-huh.

15:49.368 --> 15:51.131
That's the sound of freedom!

15:52.304 --> 15:55.068
<i>And once the ultimate
dental-flossing robot</i>

15:55.141 --> 15:57.006
is up and running,
there's nothing to do

15:57.076 --> 15:59.476
but sit back and wait...

15:59.545 --> 16:01.410
Do you have any 8s?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.038
Go fish.

16:03.115 --> 16:05.515
<i>...except for
some scheduled maintenance.</i>

16:05.584 --> 16:07.245
Ohh.

16:07.319 --> 16:09.150
Son of a
Hang on.

16:09.221 --> 16:11.712
Why are you going that way?
Okay, one second. Oh

16:11.790 --> 16:13.280
Hang on.

16:13.359 --> 16:16.385
My prediction is that
we'll get out on good behavior

16:16.462 --> 16:18.396
before we actually
get out of prison.

16:18.464 --> 16:20.364
Maybe Grant and I
will get out on good behavior.

16:20.432 --> 16:22.423
Tory is probably a lifer.

16:22.501 --> 16:24.526
He's a bad boy.

16:27.273 --> 16:29.503
Spirits are down
in cell block "A."

16:33.145 --> 16:35.579
Looks like we need
a good cavity search.

16:35.648 --> 16:38.276
<i>But in spite
of the oppressive regime,</i>

16:38.350 --> 16:40.181
there is hope.

16:40.252 --> 16:41.446
So, after 31/2 hours,

16:41.520 --> 16:45.251
the ultimate flossing machine
has given us a glimmer of hope.

16:45.324 --> 16:47.519
There's a shiny spot
worn into the bar.

16:47.593 --> 16:51.393
Now, it's not very deep, so it's
a very tiny glimmer of hope,

16:51.463 --> 16:53.454
but that's only 31/2 hours.

16:53.532 --> 16:55.659
We're gonna let it go for more
and see how far we get.

16:55.734 --> 16:57.793
<i>So, our merry metalworkers</i>

16:57.870 --> 17:00.304
leave the robot flossing
for a full week

17:00.372 --> 17:01.896
before they check the results.

17:03.108 --> 17:06.976
And while it may not be as fast
as a hard-core hacksaw blade,

17:07.046 --> 17:10.675
amazingly, Grant's gadget
is doing its job.

17:12.451 --> 17:14.612
So, it looks like we got
a little progress. How'd we do?

17:14.686 --> 17:15.675
Well, over our week,

17:15.753 --> 17:19.451
we did a total of 2, 111.5
minutes of flossing,

17:19.525 --> 17:22.983
which corresponds
to 35.2 hours.

17:23.061 --> 17:23.925
Wow.

17:23.996 --> 17:26.624
We got. 015 of an inch.

17:26.699 --> 17:28.326
So it's actually
cutting through the bars.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.198
It's gonna take you forever,
but you can actually do it.

17:31.270 --> 17:35.900
At that rate,
it'll take us 140,767 minutes.

17:35.975 --> 17:37.067
What's that break down to?

17:37.142 --> 17:38.370
Well, assuming you could do

17:38.444 --> 17:39.911
eight hours of flossing
a night,

17:39.979 --> 17:42.072
that would be 293 days.

17:42.147 --> 17:45.173
But remember, that's only
one cut in one bar.

17:45.251 --> 17:47.651
Theoretically, if you can cut
into one bar, you can cut two.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.051
So we're calling
this one plausible.

17:49.121 --> 17:50.850
- Yeah. Plausible.
- Plausible it is.

17:54.827 --> 17:58.524
<i>In the movies, people
hang on to all sorts of things.</i>

17:58.597 --> 18:01.293
But can you really
cling onto a car?

18:01.367 --> 18:04.165
That's what the Mythbusters
are about to find out.

18:06.238 --> 18:09.036
Despite Buster's
backbreaking behavior...

18:09.108 --> 18:10.871
I'm gonna hold on real nice.

18:10.943 --> 18:12.501
<i>...Jamie figures that his grip</i>

18:12.578 --> 18:14.739
will brace him against
the movement of the car...

18:15.981 --> 18:19.280
...and he won't become
a missile like a dummy.

18:19.351 --> 18:23.481
Well, so far, I'm convinced that
our rig is safe for us to use.

18:23.555 --> 18:27.047
As for the myth, honestly,
it's not looking that good

18:27.126 --> 18:29.424
as far as the dummy's behavior.

18:29.495 --> 18:31.360
That doesn't necessarily
have any bearing

18:31.430 --> 18:33.523
on what happens
when Jamie gets on the roof.

18:33.599 --> 18:36.432
This is a guy who scaled
a building on a knotted rope.

18:36.502 --> 18:38.470
This is a guy who water-skied
behind a rowboat.

18:38.537 --> 18:41.404
He broke down a door
with nothing but his shoulder.

18:42.374 --> 18:45.810
<i>So while superhuman
Jamie psychs up and clips on,</i>

18:45.878 --> 18:46.970
here's the plan.

18:47.046 --> 18:48.911
- I'm toast.
- Yeah.

18:48.981 --> 18:51.313
<i>The boys are going to
break the car-cling myth</i>

18:51.383 --> 18:54.409
into three classic,
testable elements.

18:58.324 --> 19:03.193
At speeds up to 45 miles an
hour, will Jamie cling or fling?

19:03.262 --> 19:05.253
So, we were thinking,
if you're driving down the road

19:05.331 --> 19:06.798
and someone's
on the roof of your car,

19:06.865 --> 19:08.355
the first thing
that's gonna occur to you

19:08.434 --> 19:11.232
is to do a kind of swervy
maneuver to shake them off.

19:11.303 --> 19:13.396
That's what
we're gonna start with.

19:15.107 --> 19:17.337
Well, the insurance company

19:17.409 --> 19:19.969
won't let us go
above 45 miles per hour,

19:20.045 --> 19:23.014
so I say let's go to 45
and give it all we got.

19:23.082 --> 19:25.243
- I'm ready for you, buddy.
- Let's go.

19:25.317 --> 19:28.548
I think I had a nightmare
just like this once.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.645
<i>To make things
a little bit easier for Jamie,</i>

19:30.723 --> 19:33.419
for this initial test,
although the speed is up,

19:33.492 --> 19:35.153
the windows
have been rolled down.

19:35.227 --> 19:37.161
Will Jamie get a grip?

19:37.229 --> 19:42.496
Okay, here we go.
Multiple swerves in 3, 2, 1.

19:42.568 --> 19:43.830
Go.

19:43.902 --> 19:45.802
I've got to get into character.

19:45.871 --> 19:47.566
Who's that on my car?

19:47.639 --> 19:50.073
Yeah, baby!

19:50.142 --> 19:51.632
Come on, give it to me!

19:51.710 --> 19:53.268
Here we go. Swerve one!

19:53.345 --> 19:56.109
Swerve two!
Serve three!

19:56.181 --> 19:58.376
Come on!

19:58.450 --> 20:02.079
<i>Amazingly, despite
the considerable G-forces,</i>

20:02.154 --> 20:04.054
Jamie hangs in there with ease.

20:04.123 --> 20:05.317
How was that, dude?

20:05.391 --> 20:06.756
It wasn't a problem
holding on,

20:06.825 --> 20:09.419
but it's a little thrilling.

20:09.495 --> 20:10.792
Really?

20:10.863 --> 20:13.661
Yeah, let's go for 100.

20:13.732 --> 20:16.132
<i>So far, it's a walk
in the park for the Hyneman.</i>

20:16.201 --> 20:17.498
But let's face it,

20:17.569 --> 20:20.037
when did the movie villain
roll down the windows?

20:20.105 --> 20:22.972
It's time to get serious.

20:26.612 --> 20:29.445
Adam takes her up to 45.

20:29.515 --> 20:32.075
Jamie grips on to not very much.

20:32.151 --> 20:36.713
He holds the first swerve,
but then he's off.

20:40.492 --> 20:42.960
- Dude, tell me you're okay.
- I'm fine.

20:43.028 --> 20:44.256
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:44.329 --> 20:46.559
I lost it on the second turn.

20:46.632 --> 20:50.625
The first one I was okay,
but that little two-step got me,

20:50.702 --> 20:52.363
and I went over the side.

20:52.438 --> 20:55.305
I was holding on as hard
as I could, but I just slid.

20:56.108 --> 20:58.076
<i>So with our cling-on cowboy</i>

20:58.143 --> 21:01.943
slung off at 45 miles an hour,

21:02.014 --> 21:05.677
part one of the car-cling trio
is busted.

21:05.751 --> 21:08.720
So it's onward and upward.

21:08.787 --> 21:12.985
This next one, I'm calling
this test the long turn.

21:13.058 --> 21:15.049
Effectively,
I'm gonna be driving in circles,

21:15.127 --> 21:17.960
applying centrifugal force
on Jamie,

21:18.030 --> 21:20.726
starting off slowly,
but eventually ramping it up

21:20.799 --> 21:23.597
to see if I can find his limit.

21:23.669 --> 21:25.034
<i>And from here on in,</i>

21:25.103 --> 21:29.267
the boys are only going to test
with the windows up.

21:29.341 --> 21:30.899
- I'm ready.
- All right, here we go.

21:30.976 --> 21:34.173
Centrifugal turn
with a single complication.

21:34.246 --> 21:35.645
Uh-oh.

21:36.815 --> 21:38.874
<i>Even as Adam reaches 15,</i>

21:38.951 --> 21:40.816
it's clear
that Jamie's struggling.

21:40.886 --> 21:41.978
Aah!

21:42.054 --> 21:45.217
<i>Then, at only
20 miles an hour, he's down.</i>

21:45.290 --> 21:46.985
Aaah!

21:47.059 --> 21:49.152
That's it.

21:53.232 --> 21:54.597
I'm okay.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.156
How are you doing there,
brother?

21:57.503 --> 21:58.970
That's kind of hard.

21:59.037 --> 22:02.598
I was doing all right,
but all my weight

22:02.674 --> 22:05.802
is just right on that little tip
of the finger,

22:05.878 --> 22:09.245
and sooner or later, they give.

22:09.314 --> 22:11.578
<i>In fact,
it's virtually impossible,</i>

22:11.650 --> 22:14.050
meaning that part two
is also busted.

22:14.119 --> 22:16.485
So it's time for the finale.

22:16.555 --> 22:18.147
Windows up.

22:18.223 --> 22:22.887
As we usually do, we have saved
the worst for last.

22:22.961 --> 22:27.057
We are now going to subject
Jamie to the sudden stop,

22:27.132 --> 22:29.191
which hopefully will send him

22:29.268 --> 22:31.463
virtually tumbling forward
on the car.

22:31.537 --> 22:33.334
I won't be adding the second
part that you always see

22:33.405 --> 22:35.270
in the movies
in which I drive over him.

22:35.340 --> 22:37.365
That's what our rig
is supposed to prevent,

22:37.442 --> 22:39.000
but I'll tell you, I don't think

22:39.077 --> 22:41.068
he's gonna be able
to hold on during this test.

22:41.146 --> 22:43.614
Sudden stop, here we go.

22:43.682 --> 22:45.877
In 3, 2, 1.

22:45.951 --> 22:47.145
<i>For safety's sake,</i>

22:47.219 --> 22:50.382
Adam takes the car
up to just 25 miles an hour.

22:50.455 --> 22:52.889
Jamie desperately braces himself

22:52.958 --> 22:55.119
with all the strength
he can muster.

23:01.199 --> 23:01.961
I'm okay.

23:02.034 --> 23:04.366
<i>But the Hyneman heave
ain't enough.</i>

23:04.436 --> 23:07.633
I'm all right.
Well, I think that test is done.

23:07.706 --> 23:09.606
I think so.

23:09.675 --> 23:11.836
I'm actually
seeing some stars from that.

23:11.910 --> 23:13.207
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:13.278 --> 23:16.509
<i>As Jamie flew off
the roof like a giant piñata,</i>

23:16.582 --> 23:19.779
the G-force was so great
that he nearly blacked out.

23:19.851 --> 23:21.682
It's a seriously close call,

23:21.753 --> 23:24.586
but after a medical checkup,
he's given the green light.

23:24.656 --> 23:25.748
Good job.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.956
That one was a little too close
for comfort.

23:29.027 --> 23:31.723
I really dug my fingers
into the windshield.

23:31.797 --> 23:34.197
I knew exactly when Adam
was gonna hit the brake,

23:34.266 --> 23:35.494
and I was braced for it,

23:35.567 --> 23:38.365
but it still
just wasn't quite enough.

23:38.437 --> 23:40.530
But in a real-life situation,

23:40.606 --> 23:43.973
you're not gonna know
when something's gonna happen.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.600
You're not gonna be able
to brace for it.

23:45.677 --> 23:50.614
So that's a huge difference,
and, like as not,

23:50.682 --> 23:53.378
you're gonna be flying
off the car in a heartbeat.

23:53.452 --> 23:56.819
<i>In other words,
it's part three busted.</i>

23:56.888 --> 23:59.379
And after drama
like that last test,

23:59.458 --> 24:01.949
you'd think the Mythbusters
would pack up and head home,

24:02.027 --> 24:04.621
but, no, no, no.

24:07.599 --> 24:12.002
Next up, another
fan-fueled jailbreak myth.

24:15.774 --> 24:19.574
Okay, so our last prison-escape
myth is a bit bizarre.

24:19.645 --> 24:22.808
It comes from a fan posting
under username "Pizzazz I. P.,"

24:22.881 --> 24:25.645
and it's a story of
an 18th-century prison escape.

24:25.717 --> 24:27.981
And according to
our message-board friend,

24:28.053 --> 24:30.954
in this prison, all the
prisoners had ball and chain.

24:31.023 --> 24:32.991
But instead of being a hindrance
to his escape

24:33.058 --> 24:35.117
like you might think,
it was actually his method.

24:35.193 --> 24:35.989
How?

24:36.061 --> 24:38.894
Well, in this particular prison,
there was a cannon on the roof.

24:38.964 --> 24:41.728
Every hour on the hour,
the cannon would fire.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.734
So one day
while no one's looking,

24:43.802 --> 24:46.771
he sneaks up to the roof,
drops his ball in the cannon,

24:46.838 --> 24:48.100
and you see where
I'm going here, right?

24:48.173 --> 24:51.165
Yeah, he fires the cannon, the
cannon sends him over the wall,

24:51.243 --> 24:53.677
he survives,
and returns to a life of crime.

24:53.745 --> 24:54.803
Exactly.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.815
Sounds like it's boom time.

24:57.883 --> 25:00.909
<i>It's
a preposterous prison parable.</i>

25:00.986 --> 25:04.319
Can a felon armed with a cannon,
black powder,

25:04.389 --> 25:09.088
and a ball and chain
really fire himself to freedom?

25:11.863 --> 25:13.956
This sounds like a crazy myth.

25:14.032 --> 25:15.624
Sounds like a perfect job
for Buster.

25:15.701 --> 25:17.896
Yeah, but no one is gonna
let us use their cannon

25:17.969 --> 25:19.596
to fire ball and chains
out of them.

25:19.671 --> 25:20.865
We're probably gonna destroy it,

25:20.939 --> 25:22.236
so we're gonna have to
build our own

25:22.307 --> 25:24.036
so that way we can fire it
up at the sky

25:24.109 --> 25:26.236
and see if we can get Buster
to escape.

25:26.311 --> 25:29.337
Cool, but if we're gonna start
building cannons, balls, chains,

25:29.414 --> 25:31.279
I think we need to do
a bit of research first.

25:31.349 --> 25:33.340
Sounds good.

25:33.418 --> 25:36.148
<i>So our budding jail
busters are going to blast off</i>

25:36.221 --> 25:38.382
with some Homemade Cannon 101.

25:39.891 --> 25:41.586
Whoa, there it is!

25:43.395 --> 25:44.760
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

25:44.830 --> 25:47.025
<i>And Mythbusters pal Frank Tabor</i>

25:47.099 --> 25:50.330
is the guy
with all the gumpf on guns.

25:50.402 --> 25:51.562
Big ones.

25:51.636 --> 25:54.104
We're trying to build a cannon,
and we heard you had a mortar,

25:54.172 --> 25:55.833
so we thought we'd come down
and take a look at it

25:55.907 --> 25:57.169
and maybe get some ideas.

25:57.242 --> 25:58.641
Yeah, it's gonna be
the same principle.

25:58.710 --> 26:00.337
You're just gonna have
a longer barrel on yours.

26:00.412 --> 26:01.606
Mortars are shorter.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.649
<i>And, of course, the
stuff that sets these babies off</i>

26:04.716 --> 26:06.115
is black powder.

26:06.184 --> 26:07.742
How much powder do you use?

26:07.819 --> 26:10.344
For us to send
a 16-pound bowling ball,

26:10.422 --> 26:14.222
we use three 12-gauge shotgun
shells full of black powder,

26:14.292 --> 26:17.318
and that'll push it out
about 700, 800 yards.

26:17.395 --> 26:18.760
<i>Sounds perfect.</i>

26:20.232 --> 26:24.191
So our fantastic fabricators
measure up.

26:24.269 --> 26:26.134
I think we've got
some good stuff.

26:26.204 --> 26:28.604
- Yeah, I think we're good.
- Where's Frank?

26:31.143 --> 26:31.973
What are you doing?

26:32.043 --> 26:34.375
- How fast can you run?
- Very!

26:39.084 --> 26:41.678
<i>With the
smoking-cannon design sussed,</i>

26:41.753 --> 26:43.914
Tory and Kari next walk the line

26:43.989 --> 26:46.514
with some
ball-and-chain chatter.

26:46.591 --> 26:48.559
To investigate what a real
ball and chain would look like,

26:48.627 --> 26:50.288
we've come
to Folsom State Prison,

26:50.362 --> 26:52.091
because not only is this
a famous prison,

26:52.164 --> 26:53.392
but it has a long history,

26:53.465 --> 26:55.558
and we think that this will be
a great place to start.

26:55.634 --> 27:00.003
<i>So cue prison-museum
manager Jim Brown.</i>

27:00.071 --> 27:02.232
So, say a prisoner
is about 170 pounds,

27:02.307 --> 27:04.366
which is the size
of our crash-test dummy.

27:04.442 --> 27:06.342
What size ball would he have?
Would it be like this?

27:06.411 --> 27:08.038
Probably be more like this one.

27:08.113 --> 27:10.980
This one with shackle and chain
is 37 pounds.

27:11.049 --> 27:12.983
That looks
about 5 inches in diameter.

27:13.051 --> 27:16.384
- It's 55/8 diameter.
- All right, cool.

27:16.454 --> 27:18.649
Now we know what size ball
to get.

27:20.058 --> 27:22.083
<i>So, with the research
all sorted...</i>

27:22.160 --> 27:23.559
Take it away!

27:23.628 --> 27:25.653
<i>...it's time
to get down to work.</i>

27:27.332 --> 27:30.062
One cannon coming up.

27:30.135 --> 27:31.432
<i>But will it work?</i>

27:31.503 --> 27:34.597
To avoid a bad case
of cannon malfunction,

27:34.673 --> 27:37.836
Tory is using 2-inch-thick steel
for the barrel

27:37.909 --> 27:40.241
and solid
101/2-inch-thick steel

27:40.312 --> 27:42.542
for the combustion chamber.

27:42.614 --> 27:44.514
So, this big chunk
of steel right here

27:44.583 --> 27:46.517
is our combustion chamber
for our cannon.

27:46.585 --> 27:49.782
We've bored it out to hold
the black powder and a barrel.

27:49.855 --> 27:52.653
Now, I'd pick it up
and show you, but...

27:55.694 --> 27:57.252
...it weighs 225 pounds.

27:57.329 --> 27:58.853
But it has to be strong,

27:58.930 --> 28:01.694
'cause the last thing we want
is for this cannon to explode.

28:02.701 --> 28:06.262
<i>So, while Tory welds
his ancient artillery together,</i>

28:06.338 --> 28:10.399
Grant bashes out some
period-perfect ball and chains.

28:10.475 --> 28:12.204
It's a prisoner's best friend.

28:12.277 --> 28:13.801
<i>And they're good to go.</i>

28:13.879 --> 28:18.578
That's assuming, of course, that
Tory's piece stays in one piece.

28:18.650 --> 28:20.743
It's a thing of beauty.

28:21.486 --> 28:23.181
This is my first cannon.

28:23.255 --> 28:24.620
Let's hope it works.

28:27.726 --> 28:28.920
Over the years,
we have done

28:28.994 --> 28:31.087
some pretty outrageous things
with automobiles.

28:31.162 --> 28:33.221
We've built custom
ejection seats into them

28:33.298 --> 28:35.129
and activated them on Buster.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.363
We have jumped them 175 feet
and remote-controlled them.

28:38.436 --> 28:40.904
And we've put rockets
in the back.

28:40.972 --> 28:42.599
This mod right here is up there

28:42.674 --> 28:44.574
with one of the coolest things
we've ever done.

28:45.610 --> 28:47.805
<i>And they've been
using it to find out</i>

28:47.879 --> 28:51.440
if you can really cling on
to the roof of a moving car.

28:51.516 --> 28:53.882
And the results are not good.

28:53.952 --> 28:57.115
With windows up,
Jamie was forever flung off.

28:57.188 --> 28:59.884
But the roof was just one half
of the myth.

28:59.958 --> 29:02.893
The other movie staple
is the hood hang.

29:02.961 --> 29:05.156
First, the zigzag.

29:05.230 --> 29:07.926
All right, dude.
Give me all you got.

29:09.601 --> 29:11.967
<i>And rather
than give it all he's got,</i>

29:12.037 --> 29:13.971
Jamie's going to take it slow...

29:14.039 --> 29:16.906
three zigzags
at 20 miles an hour.

29:19.544 --> 29:21.671
How do you like that?
How about that?

29:21.746 --> 29:24.510
<i>But that's all it
needs for Adam to get airborne,</i>

29:24.582 --> 29:27.949
and it's all down
to a tenacious grip.

29:28.019 --> 29:29.782
The problem
with the swerve-swerve

29:29.854 --> 29:31.719
is what you're holding onto
here on the hood.

29:31.790 --> 29:33.621
It's not uniform
like the car doors.

29:33.692 --> 29:35.182
There's a whole bunch of vents

29:35.260 --> 29:37.160
and windshield-wiper parts
in there.

29:37.228 --> 29:39.219
My hands were very close
to going into places

29:39.297 --> 29:41.527
where they'd start to incur
some serious damage.

29:41.599 --> 29:44.261
I have to say, swerve-swerve...
boop... it's out.

29:45.036 --> 29:46.503
<i>So after a quick reset,</i>

29:46.571 --> 29:49.233
it's on to the long-curve test.

29:49.307 --> 29:51.275
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

29:52.243 --> 29:54.541
About 15 miles an hour.

29:54.612 --> 29:57.979
<i>Jamie pulls away,
and Adam starts off confident.</i>

29:58.049 --> 30:00.847
Oh, I can still hold that.
Go faster.

30:00.919 --> 30:03.319
Whoa!

30:03.388 --> 30:07.290
But soon gets his comeuppance
at just 20 miles an hour.

30:07.359 --> 30:10.351
Oh. Whoa!

30:12.330 --> 30:15.822
Yeah, that was about my limit
right there.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.800
The problem with
the long centrifugal turn

30:17.869 --> 30:19.894
isn't a problem with my grip.

30:19.971 --> 30:20.938
It's with my attitude.

30:21.006 --> 30:22.837
And I don't mean
my mental attitude, either.

30:22.907 --> 30:24.636
I mean my orientation
to the car.

30:24.709 --> 30:27.542
My grip on the hood
is linear to the car,

30:27.612 --> 30:29.045
but the force on me
from the turn

30:29.114 --> 30:30.513
is perpendicular to the car.

30:30.582 --> 30:32.846
So it doesn't matter
how hard I'm grabbing.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.408
Eventually, I'm being pulled
so hard this way,

30:35.487 --> 30:38.251
I just can't hold on any longer.

30:38.323 --> 30:40.883
<i>So the roof hang
is none from two,</i>

30:40.959 --> 30:43.587
and that just leaves
the emergency brake,

30:43.661 --> 30:45.788
where anything could happen.

30:45.864 --> 30:48.162
Adam on the hood
with a sudden stop?

30:48.233 --> 30:50.633
I think he's gonna be able
to hold on,

30:50.702 --> 30:54.194
because he's in line
with the direction of force,

30:54.272 --> 30:57.605
he's got a good handhold
on the inside edge of the hood.

30:57.675 --> 30:59.768
I don't see him
coming off at all.

30:59.844 --> 31:02.210
<i>Well, there's
only one way to find out.</i>

31:02.280 --> 31:03.338
I'll be careful.

31:03.415 --> 31:05.007
25.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.778
<i>And at 25 miles an hour,</i>

31:06.851 --> 31:09.479
Adam pulls it off
with room to spare.

31:13.825 --> 31:16.589
25 miles per hour?
No problem.

31:16.661 --> 31:19.095
Let's go to the maximum, 45.

31:19.164 --> 31:22.258
<i>Throwing caution
and insurance to the wind,</i>

31:22.333 --> 31:24.301
Jamie floors it for the finale.

31:24.369 --> 31:25.461
35.

31:25.537 --> 31:28.631
45 miles an hour.

31:35.947 --> 31:38.711
Yeah!
I held on!

31:38.783 --> 31:41.445
<i>Again Adam gets no airtime,</i>

31:41.519 --> 31:43.714
and that's because
Jamie was right.

31:43.788 --> 31:47.724
The huge force Adam's under
is parallel with his body.

31:47.792 --> 31:51.489
That means it's much easier
for him to get a grip.

31:51.563 --> 31:54.054
I think we're done here.
You want to go back to the city?

31:54.132 --> 31:55.793
- I do.
- You want to stay up there?

31:55.867 --> 31:57.334
Absolutely.
Give me a second.

31:59.270 --> 32:00.430
Okay, go.

32:06.511 --> 32:08.809
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.178
- How fast can you run?
- Very!

32:12.450 --> 32:14.042
<i>Kari, Tory and Grant</i>

32:14.119 --> 32:16.747
are testing
a bizarre jailbreak myth.

32:16.821 --> 32:20.985
Can a man blow himself and
his ball and chain to freedom

32:21.059 --> 32:22.890
out of a cannon?

32:22.961 --> 32:25.054
So, we're here at
the Alameda County Bomb Range,

32:25.130 --> 32:26.392
which is where Mythbusters come

32:26.464 --> 32:27.954
when they want to
blow something up.

32:28.032 --> 32:30.364
We're gonna get our cannon out,
set it up,

32:30.435 --> 32:33.495
get Buster in place,
put a cannonball on his leg,

32:33.571 --> 32:35.368
and see if we can launch him
to freedom.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.567
<i>But if our eager escapologists</i>

32:37.642 --> 32:40.042
are going to blast Buster
over a prison wall...

32:40.111 --> 32:42.136
- Right here?
- Looks good to me.

32:42.213 --> 32:43.840
...they'll need a wall.

32:43.915 --> 32:45.246
So, according to the myth,

32:45.316 --> 32:47.011
the cannon was on the roof
of the building

32:47.085 --> 32:50.577
and then the cannonball, with
prisoner, was shot over a fence.

32:50.655 --> 32:53.453
That's why we're doing sort of
an imaginary low-set fence

32:53.525 --> 32:55.015
to shoot our cannonball over.

32:55.793 --> 32:57.852
<i>But before Buster gets involved,</i>

32:57.929 --> 33:00.898
the team need to test
Tory's artillery.

33:00.965 --> 33:02.762
All right,
so, for this first test,

33:02.834 --> 33:04.597
we're just seeing
if the cannon even works.

33:04.669 --> 33:07.502
So there's no Buster.
It's just the ball and chain.

33:07.572 --> 33:09.369
Yeah, 'cause we don't know
what's gonna happen

33:09.440 --> 33:10.372
when we launch this.

33:10.441 --> 33:11.430
It could explode.

33:11.509 --> 33:13.136
All right,
I say we start off small,

33:13.211 --> 33:14.439
and we'll ramp our way up.

33:14.512 --> 33:17.504
Is that you, Tory?
Are you Mr. Safety now?

33:17.582 --> 33:19.641
I like it.
I like new Tory.

33:19.717 --> 33:20.979
<i>But safety officer Tory</i>

33:21.052 --> 33:22.917
still doesn't
quite convince Kari,

33:22.987 --> 33:26.423
so she takes charge
of the charge.

33:26.491 --> 33:28.755
So, we have everything set
except for our charge.

33:28.826 --> 33:32.193
So we're gonna start with one
shotgun shell of black powder.

33:33.565 --> 33:37.968
<i>So it's boom or bust
for Tory and his cannon.</i>

33:38.036 --> 33:40.596
This is my favorite part.
I'm not gonna lie.

33:45.944 --> 33:49.607
As you see the fuse getting
shorter, the tension mounts!

33:52.584 --> 33:54.552
- Yeah!
- Yes!

33:54.619 --> 33:56.382
Touchdown!

33:56.454 --> 33:58.217
- Nice!
- That was sick!

33:58.289 --> 33:59.347
Nice.

33:59.424 --> 34:00.721
- All right.
- Good pop.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.054
Cannon works!

34:02.126 --> 34:05.152
<i>Traveling at more
than 130 miles an hour,</i>

34:05.230 --> 34:09.098
the ball and chain
shot 80 yards.

34:09.167 --> 34:13.627
That's way over the wall
and just perfect for our myth.

34:15.106 --> 34:18.563
All right, buddy, it's time
for the old ball and chain.

34:18.643 --> 34:20.907
So now the team is ready
to load the cannon

34:20.978 --> 34:26.076
and let rip once again,
this time with Buster in tow...

34:26.150 --> 34:28.846
It's nothing personal, you know.
You know that, right?

34:28.920 --> 34:32.321
<i>...and with a bit more
grunt to get him on his way.</i>

34:32.389 --> 34:35.359
Okay, two shotgun shells
of black powder.

34:35.426 --> 34:37.621
Okay, so,
our cannon is in place.

34:37.695 --> 34:40.027
It's aimed at the wall.
The wall is all set up.

34:40.098 --> 34:42.862
We've got our cannonball
attached to Buster's leg,

34:42.934 --> 34:45.994
and our prisoner Buster
is ready to fly.

34:46.070 --> 34:48.538
All we need to do
is light the fuse.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.335
Yeah!

34:53.411 --> 34:55.379
Something good
is bound to happen.

34:55.446 --> 34:57.004
Something's gonna happen.

34:57.081 --> 34:58.981
Let's hope it just
knocks him over the fence

34:59.050 --> 35:00.449
and the myth's confirmed.

35:06.291 --> 35:09.624
<i>The ball and chain
shot out of the cannon okay,</i>

35:09.694 --> 35:12.663
but it failed to lift Buster
over the fence.

35:12.730 --> 35:15.995
So what does that mean
for our myth?

35:16.067 --> 35:17.932
- Buster moved!
- He moved!

35:18.002 --> 35:19.230
About 6 feet.

35:20.471 --> 35:23.463
But, hey, maybe we just add
a little more black powder.

35:23.541 --> 35:26.601
Maybe if two shotgun shells
get him 6 feet,

35:26.678 --> 35:29.476
maybe three shotgun shells
get him 18 feet.

35:29.547 --> 35:32.846
Why three?
Let's go to five, six even.

35:32.917 --> 35:34.817
I say ramp it up.

35:42.660 --> 35:43.888
Well, Buster
is made of metal,

35:43.961 --> 35:45.986
so he's totally missing
the human element.

35:46.064 --> 35:48.157
Well, we do have some rope.

35:48.232 --> 35:49.631
To the best of our research,

35:49.701 --> 35:51.669
it's the closest
that we could find

35:51.736 --> 35:53.795
to the breaking strength
of human tissue.

35:53.871 --> 35:55.998
<i>This half-inch synthetic rope</i>

35:56.074 --> 35:58.668
has a breaking strain
of nearly half a ton...

35:58.743 --> 35:59.505
Okay.

35:59.577 --> 36:02.068
<i>...about the same
as the muscle and ligament</i>

36:02.146 --> 36:04.910
in a real human hip joint.

36:04.982 --> 36:06.108
All right.

36:06.184 --> 36:08.584
Everybody clear?

36:09.554 --> 36:11.715
Here we go!

36:13.591 --> 36:15.559
Come on!
Here we go!

36:17.261 --> 36:19.821
Aah!

36:21.899 --> 36:23.389
<i>Is it a bird?</i>

36:23.968 --> 36:25.435
Is it a plane?

36:25.503 --> 36:27.368
No, it's a leg...

36:28.272 --> 36:30.934
...traveling
at over 200 miles an hour.

36:31.008 --> 36:32.600
But it's still not enough

36:32.677 --> 36:36.636
to lift Buster's body
into the wild blue yonder.

36:37.749 --> 36:39.842
Oh, dang!

36:39.917 --> 36:41.578
That is what I'm talking about!

36:41.652 --> 36:44.280
The only thing that's free
is his leg from his body.

36:44.355 --> 36:45.982
So did he escape from prison?

36:46.057 --> 36:47.422
'Fraid not!

36:47.492 --> 36:49.255
But you know what?

36:49.327 --> 36:52.262
No matter how you look at
this one, it's still busted.

36:52.330 --> 36:53.991
Yeah, from the human
analog perspective,

36:54.065 --> 36:56.158
not only did it separate the leg
from the body,

36:56.234 --> 36:57.667
but it ripped off
all the flesh.

36:57.735 --> 36:59.066
There's no way
you're surviving that.

36:59.137 --> 37:00.900
Even with
an entirely metal skeleton,

37:00.972 --> 37:02.803
he's not making it over the wall
in one piece.

37:02.874 --> 37:04.842
Yeah.
This would never happen.

37:04.909 --> 37:06.240
- Busted.
- Busted.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.301
Totally busted.

37:14.952 --> 37:17.045
<i>Adam and Jamie
have been flung left...</i>

37:18.189 --> 37:20.157
<i>- ... right...
- Whoa!</i>

37:20.224 --> 37:21.316
<i>...and center...</i>

37:22.760 --> 37:26.127
...testing the myth of the car
cling, and the results are in.

37:26.197 --> 37:28.028
I'm all right.

37:28.099 --> 37:29.157
How are we gonna call it?

37:29.233 --> 37:32.634
Dude, I'm calling this one fun
with a capital F.

37:32.703 --> 37:35.069
I swear, this is
a whole new amusement park...

37:35.139 --> 37:36.800
Oh, you mean busted,
plausible, confirmed?

37:36.874 --> 37:37.806
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.570
Holding on
to the hood of the car,

37:39.644 --> 37:42.875
I was knocked off for two
out of the three tests we did.

37:42.947 --> 37:44.312
And as far as the roof goes,

37:44.382 --> 37:47.010
I was pretty much able
to hold on through anything.

37:47.084 --> 37:48.813
Yeah, but that was
with the windows down.

37:48.886 --> 37:51.548
In an action movie, man,
those windows are up.

37:51.622 --> 37:53.453
In which case, I'd be toast.

37:53.524 --> 37:56.152
I guess that means we have to
call it busted, huh?

37:56.227 --> 37:58.195
I agree, but I don't
want to finish up just yet.

37:58.262 --> 37:59.786
There is one more
shake-off technique

37:59.864 --> 38:00.796
that I've been dying to try.

38:00.865 --> 38:02.025
- Are you game?
- Sure.

38:02.099 --> 38:03.589
All right, let's do it.

38:04.869 --> 38:06.496
<i>And the final flinging fable</i>

38:06.571 --> 38:10.098
is not a swerve or a stop
or even a crash.

38:10.174 --> 38:14.133
It's something way more bizarre,
straight from the fan site.

38:14.212 --> 38:17.306
It is, of course,
the car-wash knockoff.

38:17.381 --> 38:19.406
As long as we're testing methods

38:19.484 --> 38:23.386
for removing unwanted pests
from the outside of your car,

38:23.454 --> 38:26.150
we couldn't finish this without
going through the car wash.

38:26.224 --> 38:29.751
<i>And first up,
it's soap dodger Jamie Hyneman.</i>

38:29.827 --> 38:30.816
Oh, you're ready?

38:33.831 --> 38:35.128
Here we go!

38:35.199 --> 38:36.757
Oh, God.

38:40.037 --> 38:41.629
This is awesome!

38:41.706 --> 38:44.732
<i>Now, how often
do you get to wash yourself,</i>

38:44.809 --> 38:48.609
your clothes,
and your car at the same time?

38:48.679 --> 38:50.408
Oh, that's cold!

38:52.016 --> 38:54.644
I feel like I'm going
through a noodle machine.

38:54.719 --> 38:56.209
Uh-oh.

38:57.555 --> 39:01.855
<i>After a quick
blow-dry, this noodle is done.</i>

39:01.926 --> 39:04.986
How was that?

39:06.397 --> 39:07.989
That was definitely
one of those

39:08.065 --> 39:10.533
"What the heck am I doing?"
moments.

39:10.601 --> 39:12.432
What was the worst part?

39:12.503 --> 39:13.492
The cold.

39:13.571 --> 39:16.335
<i>With a water temperature of 55,</i>

39:16.407 --> 39:19.570
it sure was chilly,
but Jamie stayed on.

39:19.644 --> 39:23.910
Now, can our boy from the hood
equal this effort?

39:23.981 --> 39:25.312
I'm ready.

39:25.383 --> 39:27.578
You're gonna go through that
butt-first, huh?

39:27.652 --> 39:28.983
Absolutely.

39:29.053 --> 39:31.487
All right, then.
Well, have fun.

39:31.556 --> 39:32.580
I will.

39:33.824 --> 39:36.258
<i>Adam have fun?
Surely not!</i>

39:36.327 --> 39:38.420
Oh, no!

39:38.496 --> 39:40.259
Oh, that's cold!

39:40.331 --> 39:42.196
<i>Adam clings on
through the rinse...</i>

39:42.266 --> 39:43.961
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

39:44.035 --> 39:45.297
<i>...and through the spin.</i>

39:45.369 --> 39:48.270
The drying gives him a shock...

39:49.540 --> 39:50.973
...but not a knock.

39:51.042 --> 39:52.737
It's a thing, isn't it?

39:52.810 --> 39:54.038
Yeah.

39:54.111 --> 39:56.045
I'm glad I did that,

39:56.113 --> 39:58.809
and I'm glad I don't ever
have to do it again.

39:58.883 --> 39:59.975
Okay, so the story is,

40:00.051 --> 40:02.417
this is supposed to
knock you off the car.

40:02.486 --> 40:03.953
Not even close.

40:04.021 --> 40:05.613
I didn't even have to hold on.

40:05.690 --> 40:09.888
It's not very pleasant, but it's
not gonna knock you off the car.

40:11.028 --> 40:12.325
This falls into the category

40:12.396 --> 40:14.125
of the kind of thing
that 10 years from now,

40:14.198 --> 40:16.359
someone's gonna say to me,
"I wonder what it's like

40:16.434 --> 40:18.231
to ride a car on the outside
through a car wash. "

40:18.302 --> 40:21.738
And I'll get to say,
not only have I done that,

40:21.806 --> 40:25.765
I did it in the name of science,
because this myth is busted.

40:26.305 --> 40:32.470
