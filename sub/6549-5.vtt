00:00.610 --> 00:03.719
- Frankenstein?
- It contains references to galvanism, sir.

00:03.721 --> 00:06.519
- Do you know much about it?
- Not my subject, I'm afraid.

00:06.521 --> 00:10.920
- What brings you here, Mr. Marlott?
- A crime I'm investigating.

00:10.922 --> 00:14.640
A little girl lost,
in a rose pink dress.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.001
I know that picture.

00:16.003 --> 00:19.000
He's out to catch someone
and you're his bait.

00:19.002 --> 00:23.440
- For a tup?
- They don't plan to tup you, Flora.

00:23.442 --> 00:25.202
They plan to kill you.

00:33.522 --> 00:36.440
- How's Flora?
- She breathes.

00:36.442 --> 00:38.280
Nothing else.

00:38.282 --> 00:41.640
A family of murderers that
call themselves the Bishops.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.160
They killed to sell to
the surgery school, sir.

00:44.162 --> 00:45.917
We now have a potential
scandal on our hands

00:45.920 --> 00:48.141
which threatens to do exactly
what that monstrous object you found

00:48.144 --> 00:49.794
was designed to bring about.

00:49.797 --> 00:52.480
God help us when the
newspapers get hold of this!

00:52.482 --> 00:56.080
"Why, on the eve of the Anatomy Act,

00:56.082 --> 00:59.840
"has the disclosure of this
monstrous artefact been suppressed

00:59.842 --> 01:03.685
"denying Londoners the knowledge of
a diabolical surgeon in their midst

01:03.685 --> 01:08.800
"acting in apparent imitation of
Mary Shelley's infamous mad man,

01:08.802 --> 01:10.682
"Victor Frankenstein?"

01:18.282 --> 01:22.040
Oh! You're sure? I won't
think any the less of you.

01:22.042 --> 01:25.202
I feel as if I'm standing
at the edge of the world.

01:28.362 --> 01:31.722
- The household's asleep.
- William.

To the unflinching eye of

02:11.322 --> 02:14.440
You're the poet, Shelley.
Give us some words.

02:14.442 --> 02:19.520
We're about to take a step that will alter
the course of natural philosophy forever.

02:19.522 --> 02:22.280
What words could possibly suffice?

02:22.282 --> 02:24.080
James.

02:24.082 --> 02:26.080
Is she to stay?

02:26.082 --> 02:28.722
She's as committed as any man.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.882
The honour is yours.

03:17.442 --> 03:20.400
To examine the causes of life,

03:20.402 --> 03:23.402
we must first have recourse to death.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.640
You scavengers!

04:24.642 --> 04:27.480
- Ingrates.
- Bastards!

04:27.482 --> 04:30.440
If it wasn't for us, they'd
be wallowing in scrofula!

04:30.442 --> 04:34.480
Mind your tongue, Garnet. And smile!
When you learn?

04:34.482 --> 04:38.040
At times like this, appearances
aren't merely important,

04:38.042 --> 04:39.840
they're everything.

04:39.842 --> 04:42.760
Get the nurses and orderlies
to man the gates.

04:42.762 --> 04:44.720
I won't have my hospital overrun.

04:44.722 --> 04:49.082
You're on ward round this morning.
I've urgent business to attend to.

04:52.842 --> 04:56.602
Whatever you say... cousin.

05:00.442 --> 05:02.840
You? Here?

05:02.842 --> 05:06.920
How dare you? I told you I
never wanted to see you again.

05:06.922 --> 05:07.802
Out.

05:07.805 --> 05:10.441
Not before you tell me why you
went back to Hogg's laboratory.

05:10.442 --> 05:13.280
- Pirkis.
- I'll reveal what you did.

05:13.282 --> 05:16.880
- What we did.
- I have less to lose.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.442
Sir?

05:20.082 --> 05:24.720
Yes, thank you, Pirkis. Two
glasses and my finest port.

05:24.722 --> 05:27.067
Mrs. Shelley and I are going to
toast the future of medicine.

05:27.070 --> 05:29.164
Yes, straight away.

05:31.242 --> 05:35.640
You ask me why I went back.
Ask yourself why you've never left.

05:35.642 --> 05:38.640
Mocking my achievements
in your wretched novel!

05:38.642 --> 05:41.063
Dragging my past endlessly
into the limelight.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.404
You've seen this no doubt?

05:44.642 --> 05:48.462
12 years it took to disassociate
myself from you. Now this.

05:48.495 --> 05:51.920
On the eve of the Anatomy Act,
my greatest triumph.

05:51.922 --> 05:54.162
The Anatomy Act?

05:55.362 --> 05:58.882
A free supply of corpses
to do with as you wish?

06:01.162 --> 06:02.962
It is you.

06:03.962 --> 06:05.882
Literary wretch!

06:22.162 --> 06:23.898
Your wine, sir?

06:24.322 --> 06:26.511
I'm drinking alone, apparently.

06:27.362 --> 06:29.320
Thank you, sister.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.762
There's another patient in here, sir.

06:41.642 --> 06:43.162
Flora.

06:44.562 --> 06:46.442
- Get out.
- Sir.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.042
Mr. Marlott?

07:05.122 --> 07:08.365
Sir Robert instructs me to
tell you he is occupied.

07:08.367 --> 07:09.680
What about this?

07:09.682 --> 07:13.080
- The Frankenstein murders.
- It's history, Mr. Marlott.

07:13.082 --> 07:16.920
Like yourself. Pack your bags
and get back to Wapping.

07:16.922 --> 07:21.920
Mr. Marlott! Sir Robert has known
about this all along, hasn't he?

07:21.922 --> 07:23.570
I'm not at liberty to say.

07:23.572 --> 07:26.520
Mr. Marlott, the time
for coyness is passed.

07:26.522 --> 07:29.697
Who would place power into the
surgeon's hands after this?

07:29.699 --> 07:31.240
Don't berate him, Bentley.

07:31.242 --> 07:35.242
- None of this is his doing.
- No. You are right, my dear.

07:36.402 --> 07:39.240
He only answers to his master's voice.

07:39.242 --> 07:43.000
Well, then, a gift from me to him.

07:43.002 --> 07:46.242
An emergency vote to declare
the Anatomy Act dead.

07:47.562 --> 07:50.442
What better way to
celebrate our engagement?

07:53.042 --> 07:55.240
I apologise for Sir Bentley's rudeness.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.851
He doesn't know you as I do.

07:57.762 --> 08:00.161
Come to my house in one hour.

08:06.042 --> 08:07.882
Thank you for coming.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.760
What is it you wish
to talk to me about?

08:11.762 --> 08:15.810
When we met earlier, Sir Bentley
mentioned our engagement.

08:15.850 --> 08:18.400
- Congratulations, my lady.
- Please, Mr. Marlott.

08:18.402 --> 08:21.760
He is... money to us and
I am status to him.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.695
Nothing more.

08:23.901 --> 08:26.400
You would pledge yourself
in a loveless marriage?

08:26.402 --> 08:30.506
For my brother's work. Yes.

08:31.322 --> 08:33.611
What I've concealed from
him is my intention

08:33.614 --> 08:36.039
to disappoint him should
the Act fail to pass

08:36.042 --> 08:38.600
and my brother allowed
to continue his work.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.573
Something I now have reason to hope,

08:40.575 --> 08:43.400
thanks to the scandals
implicating the surgeons.

08:43.402 --> 08:45.400
But I know Sir Robert well.

08:45.402 --> 08:48.720
He will stop at nothing
to get his own way.

08:48.722 --> 08:51.962
Therefore, I have asked you here to...

08:53.482 --> 08:55.640
..beg you to help me.

08:55.642 --> 08:58.120
Do not let him succeed.

08:58.122 --> 09:02.080
You should know, Sir Robert wants
nothing more to do with me.

09:02.082 --> 09:04.162
I've been removed from the case.

09:06.682 --> 09:08.802
Then all hope is truly lost.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.200
I have a confession of
my own to make, my lady.

09:17.202 --> 09:19.480
That thing you read about.

09:19.482 --> 09:23.760
The Frankenstein murders were
the reason Sir Robert hired me.

09:23.762 --> 09:28.480
My investigations led me to suspect
all who oppose the Anatomy Act,

09:28.482 --> 09:31.240
your brother included. My brother?

09:31.242 --> 09:34.520
Responsible for that?
Please, listen to me.

09:34.522 --> 09:38.400
If Sir Robert's wrong, then
the mad man who made it

09:38.402 --> 09:41.162
could very well have been a surgeon.

09:42.362 --> 09:47.320
Sir William Chester? Someone
without regard to human suffering.

09:47.322 --> 09:51.080
I swear to you, whoever
it is, I'll find him.

09:51.082 --> 09:55.202
Should he be the highest in
the land, I'll find him.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.082
Then I was right!

10:00.282 --> 10:02.442
You ARE a man of God.

10:18.482 --> 10:21.240
If it's your position
that concerns you...

10:21.242 --> 10:23.242
No. It's not that.

10:24.202 --> 10:27.362
Forgive me. Forgive me.

10:29.602 --> 10:31.960
All things might be possible.

10:31.962 --> 10:33.842
In time.

10:35.882 --> 10:40.402
But time is not with us and
my adversaries are powerful.

10:44.362 --> 10:46.882
Then I will wait.

10:48.242 --> 10:53.642
And pray for your success in
bringing them to justice.

11:14.082 --> 11:16.240
Who are you?

11:16.242 --> 11:19.680
- Joseph Nightingale, sir. Bow Street.
- What do you want?

11:19.682 --> 11:23.480
The patient is a witness. I'm to
sit with her until she wakes.

11:23.482 --> 11:27.280
Out of the question. I won't have
you jeopardising her welfare.

11:27.282 --> 11:30.402
- Will she recover?
- Out! At once! Go!

11:32.882 --> 11:37.202
You have no authority here. This
patient is under my care now.

11:59.282 --> 12:02.242
My little girl lost has been found.

12:20.598 --> 12:23.638
It's about Flora, sir. I was...

12:25.398 --> 12:27.556
Close the door, please.

12:27.558 --> 12:29.878
I need a word in private.

12:31.198 --> 12:34.996
I need you to withdraw a
pistol for me in your name.

12:34.998 --> 12:37.356
Why? I'm not employed here any more.

12:37.358 --> 12:41.436
My investigation is beginning
to step on a few powerful toes.

12:41.438 --> 12:44.996
So what now? The investigation goes on.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.998
In private.

12:48.678 --> 12:51.398
With me? If you'll agree.

12:53.118 --> 12:54.838
I'll get that pistol.

13:00.478 --> 13:03.238
This newspaper article, Mr. Marlott.

13:07.598 --> 13:11.116
This is where your missing
girls have gone to, is it not?

13:11.118 --> 13:13.996
Why did you not tell me? I couldn't.

13:13.998 --> 13:16.876
If I'd known more I
might have said more.

13:16.878 --> 13:20.556
Now we have both been defamed.
Then get a lawyer.

13:20.558 --> 13:22.716
I've other business to attend to.

13:22.718 --> 13:26.118
I know who you're looking for, Mr.
Marlott.

13:29.278 --> 13:31.676
I'm listening.

13:31.678 --> 13:36.796
I was 17 and... in
love with my husband.

13:36.798 --> 13:40.238
And with science, too.
That much you know.

13:42.118 --> 13:45.316
We were visited in Oxford
by Percy's friend.

13:45.318 --> 13:47.238
James Hogg.

13:48.998 --> 13:53.956
And he... He introduced
us to his mentor,

13:53.958 --> 13:56.038
William Chester, and his...

13:58.758 --> 14:00.198
..pursuit.

14:55.318 --> 14:56.918
Again.

15:39.998 --> 15:41.998
'Wretches, we four!'

15:44.758 --> 15:47.305
We thought we could conquer death,

15:47.307 --> 15:50.600
but we found that death
had conquered us.

15:53.998 --> 15:57.838
'William banished us to our rooms,
but sleep didn't come easily.

15:59.358 --> 16:02.918
'At dawn, we were roused by Mrs.
Hogg's screams.

16:05.078 --> 16:08.996
'A scalpel had been
placed in James's hand.

16:08.998 --> 16:11.558
'His wrists cut...

16:12.518 --> 16:14.238
'..expertly.

16:16.398 --> 16:19.558
'A verdict of suicide was infinitely
better than one of murder.

16:21.758 --> 16:23.598
'For all of us.'

16:25.678 --> 16:28.958
A young mind driven to
distraction by dark science.

16:30.078 --> 16:33.236
Why didn't you tell me this before?
How could I be sure?

16:33.238 --> 16:35.334
Either someone was tracing our steps

16:35.336 --> 16:38.396
or William Chester himself
had returned to his...

16:38.398 --> 16:40.518
great obsession.

16:42.598 --> 16:44.758
Creating life from death.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.118
Like your Victor Frankenstein.

16:51.198 --> 16:54.436
He truly thought such
a thing was possible.

16:54.438 --> 16:57.556
Still does, if my surmise is correct.

16:57.558 --> 17:01.116
Today, I confronted him
and he attacked me.

17:01.118 --> 17:02.733
Where was this? The hospital.

17:02.735 --> 17:05.575
I called on him at Greenwich,
but there was no answer.

17:05.577 --> 17:06.521
Greenwich?

17:07.558 --> 17:11.198
Their old family home, where
we first knew one another.

17:13.678 --> 17:15.798
Years ago.

17:22.038 --> 17:26.396
Do you admit purchasing bodies
from this woman? I admit nothing.

17:26.397 --> 17:30.356
Liar! He knows me well.
Let's try again.

17:30.358 --> 17:33.836
We buy things from many people.
I can't know them all.

17:33.838 --> 17:37.316
Your masters will let you
hang to protect themselves.

17:37.318 --> 17:38.999
Even if I did buy from them,

17:39.001 --> 17:42.516
it don't make me responsible
for how they come by them.

17:42.518 --> 17:45.796
That's for the law to decide. Ugh.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.756
I'll ask you again.

17:47.758 --> 17:52.236
Did you or did you not buy corpses
from that woman? It's possible!

17:52.238 --> 17:54.318
Adults? Children?

17:56.118 --> 17:59.916
Adults, maybe. Kids
is rare, I told you.

17:59.918 --> 18:02.956
How come your masters had so many?
What makes you think they did?

18:02.958 --> 18:06.676
Sir William said eight children
made up that composite,

18:06.678 --> 18:09.956
all dead within a
fortnight of each other.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.556
Well, you...?

18:12.558 --> 18:14.958
You think that he created that thing?

18:16.278 --> 18:19.956
If he did, it makes you an accessory.
So save yourself.

18:19.958 --> 18:23.398
Tell me everything you know.
I've done so already.

18:25.198 --> 18:28.678
I don't know what more I can say.
Try this another way.

18:30.078 --> 18:35.036
Does he ever require you to deliver
bodies to Greenwich? Why Greenwich?

18:35.038 --> 18:39.836
Because that poor creature floated to
Bugsby's marshes from near Greenwich,

18:39.838 --> 18:42.716
the family home of Sir William Chester.

18:42.718 --> 18:45.436
Sir William lives in Hampstead.

18:45.438 --> 18:48.638
Garnet has the house in
Greenwich, his cousin.

20:37.518 --> 20:41.876
What do you think you're doing?
Taking her far away from you.

20:41.878 --> 20:43.848
- Where she'll be safe.
- On whose authority?

20:43.998 --> 20:45.618
The law's. And God's.

20:45.620 --> 20:49.516
I am her doctor, damn you.
You will leave her be.

20:49.518 --> 20:53.156
Orderlies! Shall I tell them
you drugged her and raped her?

20:53.158 --> 20:55.638
Go ahead. No-one will believe you.

20:56.918 --> 20:59.836
The picture of the little girl lost.

20:59.838 --> 21:02.116
It was yours, wasn't it?

21:02.118 --> 21:05.396
You gave it to her to
tempt her from Billy.

21:05.398 --> 21:09.235
There's no law against giving a
girl a present. You've no proof.

21:09.237 --> 21:11.396
There's proof that you knew Billy.

21:11.398 --> 21:13.001
What other business did you do?

21:13.003 --> 21:16.036
How many children did you purchase?
This is outrageous!

21:16.038 --> 21:19.636
Many, I'd wager. Some for
pleasure, some for dissection.

21:19.638 --> 21:21.518
Stop him.

21:24.038 --> 21:26.158
It was him.

21:29.478 --> 21:31.838
He's the one who tricked me.

21:36.478 --> 21:39.196
It means nothing.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.918
There's no law against what I did to her.
Do you hear me?

21:45.438 --> 21:48.038
- Stop him.
- Get out of my way. Move!

21:49.238 --> 21:51.718
It's all right. It's all right now.

21:52.758 --> 21:55.118
You're a dead man, do you hear me?
Damn you!

21:59.158 --> 22:02.518
You ned to get strong.
I don't deserve to.

22:03.918 --> 22:06.278
Why would you say that?

22:07.438 --> 22:09.958
I killed my child.

22:11.758 --> 22:14.038
I led Alice to her death.

22:15.518 --> 22:17.638
I deserve to die.

22:19.798 --> 22:23.398
All life is precious, Flora.

22:25.398 --> 22:27.518
Yours, too.

22:29.518 --> 22:33.718
If you've been brought back,
well, there's a reason for it.

22:35.798 --> 22:38.238
You've been given another chance.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.238
Take it.

22:56.718 --> 23:00.476
Stay here and guard her -
with your life, if need be.

23:00.478 --> 23:02.836
Where are you going?
It's past midnight.

23:02.838 --> 23:07.396
Garnet knows I'm on to him. I
need proof of his guilt - fast.

23:07.398 --> 23:11.796
What proof is there? Billy
did business with Garnet.

23:11.798 --> 23:16.036
The next link in the chain.
I need Billy's confession.

23:16.038 --> 23:18.758
It's my only chance. Then God help you.

23:23.438 --> 23:26.796
I know Garnet bartered
with you for Flora.

23:26.798 --> 23:29.396
What other business
did you do with him?

23:29.398 --> 23:32.238
Did you sell Alice to him?

23:33.758 --> 23:36.876
Who does this code of
silence serve, Billy?

23:36.878 --> 23:41.558
Only your masters, who'll gladly
watch you hang to save themselves.

23:42.638 --> 23:47.196
If you help me convict them, it'll
go well for you with the court.

23:47.198 --> 23:50.198
You may find your sentence
commuted to transportation.

23:53.278 --> 23:56.396
Billy don't peach, not for no-one.

23:56.398 --> 23:59.038
Death holds no terrors for me.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.516
You know Garnet cheated
you of Flora's virginity?

24:10.518 --> 24:13.836
That's right, Billy.
She's not a virgin.

24:13.838 --> 24:17.636
After you bilked him on the price,
he drugged her, took her for free.

24:17.638 --> 24:19.636
Laughing at you.

24:19.638 --> 24:20.801
You lie!

24:20.803 --> 24:24.236
It's the truth. She was with
child and had it aborted.

24:24.238 --> 24:27.692
The girl you were saving went
to that bastard for nothing.

24:27.694 --> 24:29.836
Now you're lying to save his skin.

24:29.838 --> 24:32.118
How does that make you feel?

24:34.118 --> 24:36.238
Transportation, you say?

24:38.438 --> 24:43.236
"I, Billy Oates, this day
of the 1st April 1827,

24:43.238 --> 24:47.676
"do hereby confess that I provided
numerous unwanted children

24:47.678 --> 24:50.236
"from the streets of Smithfield

24:50.238 --> 24:53.676
"to Garnet Chester of St Bartholomew's
to do with as he wished

24:53.678 --> 24:57.476
"with no concern for their
safety or anything else,

24:57.478 --> 24:59.798
"except my own profit."

25:05.318 --> 25:07.438
Sign it, Billy.

25:25.423 --> 25:28.421
- What's going on?
- Dawn raid, sir.

25:28.423 --> 25:30.581
Where? No idea.

25:30.583 --> 25:33.501
Special order of the Home Secretary.

25:33.503 --> 25:35.035
- He's in there now.
- Beale?

25:35.037 --> 25:36.220
His man.

25:40.903 --> 25:44.583
I am assured that Warburton
will be there when you arrive.

25:47.223 --> 25:50.223
Why are you still here? To get this.

25:51.703 --> 25:55.181
A written confession describing
the supply of children

25:55.183 --> 25:59.063
from the streets of Smithfield's to
the surgeons at St Bartholomew's.

26:00.783 --> 26:03.083
You were removed from
this case yesterday.

26:03.218 --> 26:06.221
And today I have this.

26:06.223 --> 26:09.941
I suggest you take a copy
to Sir Robert immediately.

26:09.943 --> 26:13.623
Unless you want me to take this
to our friend at the Chronicle.

26:17.343 --> 26:20.623
You have your instructions.

26:27.543 --> 26:33.021
- You've been very busy, Mr. Marlott.
- My initial surmise was right, sir.

26:33.023 --> 26:38.901
That corpse child I found was not an act
of political sabotage, as you assumed,

26:38.903 --> 26:40.863
but the work of a mad man.

26:41.903 --> 26:43.016
Garnet Chester.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.301
And those murderers you
found in the East End?

26:46.303 --> 26:50.181
The Bishops are murderers, sir, but
not the ones we're looking for.

26:50.183 --> 26:53.239
They deny killing children
and I believe them.

26:53.241 --> 26:56.461
This is the man who
provided them, Billy Oates.

26:56.463 --> 27:00.261
He sold them to Garnet Chester,
who stitched them together.

27:00.263 --> 27:02.943
I'd like your permission
to arrest him, sir.

27:05.023 --> 27:09.063
Thank you, Mr. Marlott, you
have done quite enough.

27:10.263 --> 27:12.461
I'll take care of this.

27:12.463 --> 27:14.023
Personally.

27:15.343 --> 27:17.606
- What about Sir William?
- This doesn't touch him.

27:17.758 --> 27:19.771
His hospital, his cousin.

27:20.023 --> 27:23.421
No man is his brother's
keeper or his cousin's.

27:23.423 --> 27:28.261
I imagine he'll be every bit
as shocked by this as I am.

27:28.263 --> 27:31.943
Go and rest now. You've earned it.

27:32.943 --> 27:36.743
And when you wake, we'll
talk about YOUR future.

28:13.023 --> 28:14.663
Stay where you are!

28:19.023 --> 28:21.941
Get your hands off me, you brute!

28:21.943 --> 28:25.461
I'm sorry, ladies. Change of venue.

28:25.463 --> 28:29.823
Richard! Richard! Do something!

28:32.063 --> 28:34.703
Please don't tell my wife.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.221
Get up the bloody stairs.

28:41.223 --> 28:43.901
Get up. Go on!

28:43.903 --> 28:47.543
This has all been a
terrible misunderstanding.

28:48.623 --> 28:52.943
I believe you're acquainted
with this young man, Bentley.

28:59.303 --> 29:01.663
What scandalous business is this?

29:02.903 --> 29:06.743
Scandal is the last thing
any of us want, Bentley.

29:09.223 --> 29:10.863
Please.

29:14.023 --> 29:16.943
What's this? It's a calendar.

29:18.383 --> 29:20.301
How can you tell?

29:20.303 --> 29:23.181
12 pictures, 12 months.

29:23.183 --> 29:26.501
And it can tell you the seasons. Look.

29:26.503 --> 29:29.061
Green leaves, red leaves.

29:29.063 --> 29:31.663
Leaves falling and leaves gone.

29:33.543 --> 29:35.183
Simple.

30:46.703 --> 30:48.263
Agh! Sir.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.463
You'd best come quick, sir.

31:37.543 --> 31:40.903
Sir William found him
like this this morning.

31:42.183 --> 31:43.821
Suicide.

31:43.823 --> 31:47.943
As clear an admission of
guilt as any confession.

31:56.143 --> 31:59.221
'A scalpel had been
placed in James's hand,

31:59.223 --> 32:03.223
'his wrists cut... expertly.'

32:08.143 --> 32:10.416
- Thank you for coming so quickly.
- Of course.

32:10.418 --> 32:11.378
We don't have long.

32:12.143 --> 32:16.143
- Suicide.
- That's what I need YOU to determine.

32:19.023 --> 32:21.461
What do you think?

32:21.463 --> 32:23.741
It was murder.

32:23.743 --> 32:27.821
If he'd died from blood loss, there
would have been less of it, much less.

32:27.823 --> 32:29.821
I think he was killed another way.

32:29.823 --> 32:34.341
The wrists were cut afterwards to
make it look like suicide. But why?

32:34.343 --> 32:38.821
Garnet murdered, disguised as suicide.

32:38.823 --> 32:41.383
Makes him look like the guilty one.

32:42.903 --> 32:45.821
Just what is it you think
they've been up to?

32:45.823 --> 32:48.981
You read that story in the paper,

32:48.983 --> 32:53.061
the body stitched together
from different corpses.

32:53.063 --> 32:54.383
Galvanism?

32:56.543 --> 32:59.741
Well, it will play into
our hands all the same.

32:59.743 --> 33:02.701
Jemima tells me we're
on the eve of victory.

33:02.703 --> 33:06.661
An emergency vote on the
Anatomy Act tomorrow.

33:06.663 --> 33:11.143
That means my work can go on. You
still have to answer for Flora.

33:13.543 --> 33:17.543
It's a criminal act to rob an
unborn child of life, my lord.

33:18.863 --> 33:22.021
At the very least, your
practice will be closed,

33:22.023 --> 33:25.101
you yourself subject to prosecution.

33:25.103 --> 33:27.101
Is that what you want?

33:27.103 --> 33:29.343
I want to know how you justify it.

33:30.903 --> 33:33.811
I believe her existence
would have been blighted

33:33.813 --> 33:36.221
by the birth of that child, as did she.

33:36.223 --> 33:39.623
She would have died
homeless and starving.

33:40.743 --> 33:44.943
A vagrant or a prostitute, along
with her unloved offspring.

33:46.663 --> 33:49.101
You call that life?

33:49.103 --> 33:51.823
I call it suffering.

33:53.983 --> 33:55.470
Does Lady Harvey know?

33:55.472 --> 33:59.021
There is much about my
work that I keep from her.

33:59.023 --> 34:02.823
Though she would do everything
to support you in it.

34:04.343 --> 34:06.541
That is true.

34:06.543 --> 34:09.342
Her heart is filled with love for me.

34:11.822 --> 34:15.623
This, however, will surely break it.

34:18.902 --> 34:22.862
I would not be held
responsible for that.

34:24.143 --> 34:26.263
You'll forbear from telling her?

34:28.822 --> 34:30.943
For the while.

34:32.663 --> 34:36.023
If your God exists, I believe
he will cherish you for it.

34:56.422 --> 35:00.141
'Your treatment didn't work.
Too late in this case.

35:00.143 --> 35:02.263
'And in mine?

35:03.743 --> 35:08.063
'Maybe not, though you might want
to act quickly, Mr. Marlott.'

35:33.416 --> 35:35.974
Honourable members! Honourable members!

35:35.976 --> 35:39.374
Let us bring this emergency
meeting to order!

35:39.376 --> 35:40.741
The motion before us

35:40.743 --> 35:44.734
is that this House would
forbear the passing of any Act

35:44.736 --> 35:48.054
which would license the
surgeons with greater power.

35:48.056 --> 35:50.515
Pray silence for the honourable member,

35:50.517 --> 35:52.694
Sir Henry Warburton, proposing.

35:52.696 --> 35:55.096
Hear hear!

36:00.336 --> 36:02.216
Mr. Speaker.

36:04.816 --> 36:07.094
Honourable members.

36:07.096 --> 36:09.576
After much consideration...

36:12.416 --> 36:15.536
..and in the light of
recent developments...

36:18.056 --> 36:20.656
..I regret to inform the House...

36:23.376 --> 36:27.376
..I am withdrawing this motion.

36:31.576 --> 36:33.014
Order!

36:33.016 --> 36:35.736
Mr. Speaker.

36:38.376 --> 36:42.174
Mr. Speaker, the events
of the last week

36:42.176 --> 36:44.454
have shocked us all.

36:44.456 --> 36:47.654
Firstly, the discovery of
a gang of bodysnatchers

36:47.656 --> 36:52.007
rumoured to have been engaged in
the business of procuring corpses

36:52.009 --> 36:53.458
by acts of murder.

36:54.896 --> 37:00.134
Secondly, the emergence in the
press of a story of dubious origin

37:00.136 --> 37:04.654
implicating the surgeons in a
grotesque act of defilement

37:04.656 --> 37:08.294
lifted straight from the
pages of popular fiction.

37:08.296 --> 37:12.414
And, most recently, the suicide of Mr.
Garnet Chester,

37:12.416 --> 37:17.094
surgeon of St Bartholomew's, in what
appears to be a gesture of despair

37:17.096 --> 37:22.014
after being uncovered as
the source and culprit

37:22.016 --> 37:24.896
of one or more of these
terrible crimes.

37:25.776 --> 37:33.574
Never has the need for reform in the realm
of public medicine been more pressing.

37:33.576 --> 37:35.894
Hear, hear!

37:35.896 --> 37:42.654
I therefore commend Sir Bentley's
historical rejection of partisan interests

37:42.656 --> 37:46.254
in the name of the common good.
Hear, hear!

37:46.256 --> 37:50.654
I would also like to commend
the fearless work and daring

37:50.656 --> 37:56.134
of Mr. John Marlott of Bow Street.

37:56.136 --> 38:00.134
Mr. John Marlott of Bow Street,
whom I will be recommending

38:00.136 --> 38:02.814
as advisor to my special committee

38:02.816 --> 38:06.534
on the formation of the
new Metropolitan Police.

38:06.536 --> 38:09.294
Hear, hear.

38:09.296 --> 38:12.654
In light of these tragic events,

38:12.656 --> 38:18.134
it is our conviction that no
further delay should be brooked

38:18.136 --> 38:20.654
in the passage of the Anatomy Act.

38:20.656 --> 38:25.054
Let us, once and for all,
banish this trade in bodies!

38:25.056 --> 38:27.614
Let reason and regulation

38:27.616 --> 38:31.734
banish fear and scandal from
our streets and hospitals.

38:31.736 --> 38:36.254
To which end, I propose an
immediate vote on the Anatomy Act

38:36.256 --> 38:39.414
as an alternative motion
for this House today.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.494
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

38:41.496 --> 38:46.456
The motion before the house is the
immediate passage of the Anatomy Act.

39:02.696 --> 39:06.014
John Marlott for Lord and Lady Harvey.

39:06.016 --> 39:08.736
My lord and lady are not in residence.

39:32.816 --> 39:35.496
Come along, my dear...

39:48.176 --> 39:49.307
Your office.

39:49.309 --> 39:52.698
Sir Robert would like your
proposal at the end of the week.

40:07.176 --> 40:11.054
'This city, Mr. Marlott,
dragged kicking and screaming,

40:11.056 --> 40:14.854
'like a raucous infant,
towards a better future.

40:14.856 --> 40:18.976
'Do well by me and you'll
be assured a part in it.'

41:25.656 --> 41:27.496
Sir...

41:30.416 --> 41:32.416
I would like it if Flora...

41:34.456 --> 41:38.936
Flora and I... would like it
if she would move in with me.

41:41.576 --> 41:43.574
As your maid?

41:43.576 --> 41:45.654
No, sir.

41:45.656 --> 41:47.734
We wish to be married.

41:47.736 --> 41:51.454
We're both of us without family, and...

41:51.456 --> 41:53.736
we feel that we belong together.

41:55.136 --> 41:58.056
We'd very much like your blessing, sir.

42:02.536 --> 42:05.054
Well, you have it!

42:05.056 --> 42:07.896
Thank you, sir.

42:09.336 --> 42:12.494
But properly, with church
and marriage bans.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.376
Until then, she stays here. You agree?

42:17.976 --> 42:19.696
Thank you, sir.

42:21.976 --> 42:24.574
I'd like to buy us all a drink!

42:24.576 --> 42:27.494
You two go. I can't.

42:27.496 --> 42:30.854
It's a big occasion, sir.
We'd appreciate it.

42:30.856 --> 42:33.294
I have work to do. Tonight?

42:33.296 --> 42:37.094
Come on now, sir. You can
put your work off for once.

42:37.096 --> 42:39.574
I can't. In fact, I have to leave now.

42:39.576 --> 42:43.374
Where to at this time, sir? Greenwich.

42:43.376 --> 42:46.934
Why Greenwich? Garnet Chester's house.

42:46.936 --> 42:49.054
I missed something last time.

42:49.056 --> 42:52.134
But the case is closed. He was guilty.

42:52.136 --> 42:54.534
What are you looking for?

42:54.536 --> 42:56.494
Alice.

42:56.496 --> 42:58.576
Proof she was there.

42:59.576 --> 43:02.654
What makes you think you
missed it last time?

43:02.656 --> 43:06.774
Either that creature was made
there or it was kept there.

43:06.776 --> 43:11.654
It found its way to the river by
accident through a sluice or sewer.

43:11.656 --> 43:14.816
A cellar, perhaps? Probably.

43:15.776 --> 43:18.136
I'm coming with you.

44:10.696 --> 44:13.134
No sluice. No sewer.

44:13.136 --> 44:14.816
Nothing.

44:21.736 --> 44:26.214
Perhaps you were wrong, it came
into the water from somewhere else.

44:26.216 --> 44:29.814
I measured the tides. It
came from here, Greenwich.

44:29.816 --> 44:33.014
I'm sure of it. Then
someone disposed of it.

44:33.016 --> 44:36.854
Why risk it being discovered?
I don't believe they did.

44:36.856 --> 44:41.054
Sir, look at the distance
from here to the river.

44:41.056 --> 44:45.254
Do you really think it fell out
of a cart and rolled down there?

44:45.256 --> 44:48.734
By accident! It did get
there by accident.

44:48.736 --> 44:53.176
But not that way. I don't follow, sir.

44:54.816 --> 44:56.816
It moved, Nightingale.

44:58.136 --> 45:02.374
Sir William and Garnet were working
together to resurrect the dead.

45:02.376 --> 45:04.616
And they succeeded.

45:05.776 --> 45:08.056
It crawled there.

45:11.456 --> 45:13.896
I know who can help me prove it.

45:22.536 --> 45:24.696
Dover stage? Yes, sir.

45:32.296 --> 45:34.536
You're leaving London?

45:36.856 --> 45:39.414
I asked you a question, Mrs. Shelley.

45:39.416 --> 45:41.774
Leaving England, not
that it's your affair.

45:41.776 --> 45:44.576
You have unfinished business here.
Go inside.

45:45.656 --> 45:49.054
Do as I say, please. I've
told you everything I know.

45:49.056 --> 45:52.614
Sir William Chester walks
free, a murderer twice over.

45:52.616 --> 45:54.094
Twice?

45:54.096 --> 45:58.574
His cousin, Garnet, killed and made
to look like suicide, just like Hogg.

45:58.576 --> 46:02.054
What do you expect me to do?
Tell the world what you told me.

46:02.056 --> 46:05.214
Sir William Chester has
returned to galvanism.

46:05.216 --> 46:08.334
He thinks he can conquer death.
He'll sacrifice anyone.

46:08.336 --> 46:10.876
His madness is no longer my concern.

46:10.878 --> 46:13.698
You have a duty to say what you know.

46:15.016 --> 46:17.254
Let the dead bury the dead.

46:17.256 --> 46:21.654
What if they won't stay buried?
What do you mean?

46:21.656 --> 46:24.694
Where you once failed, he now succeeds.

46:24.696 --> 46:26.696
The dead live, Mrs. Shelley.

46:28.896 --> 46:31.536
- I don't believe you.
- You must.

46:33.136 --> 46:35.496
This nightmare is your creation.

46:36.816 --> 46:40.776
It's not mine any more. It's yours.

46:49.856 --> 46:52.296
Giddy-up!
