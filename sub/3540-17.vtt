I have lived in secret. Until now.

but I have to know her.

<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> There's a tomb underneath the church.
A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.311
I'm gonna bring her back.

00:14.547 --> 00:17.573
- She's not here!
- You saved everyone in the church?

00:17.784 --> 00:19.945
We've taken up residence
just outside of town.

- Some.

different from the way we thought.

Agh!
You got a problem with blood, Anna?

00:45.612 --> 00:48.740
I knew this girl, Vicki.
She was attacked, a bite to the neck.

00:48.948 --> 00:51.781
- Then I saw your face.
- Why would you confront me about it?

00:51.951 --> 00:55.250
Maybe it's true about Vicki.
And also because I want you to turn me.

<font color="#808080">JEREMY :</font> Is that a vampire thing?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.999
I read vampires
don't like running water.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.463
That's only Dracula.

01:41.634 --> 01:44.034
Yeah, he was a complete wuss.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.138
Never showered. Very smelly.

- Seriously?
- Ha, ha.

First rule about vampires:

01:51.144 --> 01:53.305
Don't believe anything you read.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.744
You gotta tell me more, I gotta know.

01:56.916 --> 01:58.679
No, you don't.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.479
- You're not gonna be one.
- You can't keep saying no.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.417
I'm not gonna turn someone...

02:03.590 --> 02:06.354
...who learned everything
about vampires from Netflix.

02:06.559 --> 02:09.152
That's not true and you know it.

<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Looks like
there's a big storm rolling in.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.312
Can you make sure
the windows are closed?

02:34.854 --> 02:36.913
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.466
<font color="#808080">FREDERICK :</font> We're running low on blood.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.570

to the hospital for some more.

<font color="#808080">PEARL :</font> I'll send her out for some tomorrow.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.332
Maybe I could go with her.

02:57.544 --> 03:00.445
If the storm keeps it dark enough,
I might be able to go out.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.979
- No sun and all.
- I'm afraid not.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.776
Not after your stunt
at the Salvatore house tonight.

03:05.985 --> 03:08.783
- He and his brother deserved it.
- What did that get you?

03:08.988 --> 03:12.981
Your girlfriend, Bethanne, is dead.
You have no one to blame but yourself.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.956
We cannot live our lives
about revenge.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.963
We have to have better control
of our emotions.

03:19.165 --> 03:21.065
I understand, Miss Pearl.

03:21.267 --> 03:23.667
I just wish I knew
what you were up to.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.602
I'm gonna make an exploratory visit
into town tomorrow...

03:31.811 --> 03:35.178
...to assess who's under the influence
of vervain and who isn't.

03:35.415 --> 03:38.384
Anna tells me
that the players haven't changed much.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.780
It's still the Lockwoods,
Forbes, the Fells...

03:40.987 --> 03:45.185
- We should kill every last one of them.
- We are smarter than that, Frederick.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.655
These people are not our enemies.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.488
We don't hold grudges
and resentments.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.961
We'll get our town back.

03:53.132 --> 03:56.033
We just have to have patience.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.038
<font color="#808080">FREDERICK :</font> You heard her.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.182
No revenge.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.880
Patience.

04:14.053 --> 04:16.146
Self-control.

04:19.492 --> 04:22.723

all figured out, doesn't she?

...and annihilate the idiot
that attacked us last night.

<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Yeah? And then what,
turn to the rest of their house of vampires...

...and say, oops, sorry?

04:42.548 --> 04:44.539
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> I can't believe
you made a deal with her.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.311
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> It's more like
a helpful exchange of information.

04:48.021 --> 04:52.082
It's not like I got a choice.
She's scary.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.089
Besides, she's gonna help me
get Katherine back.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.556
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Of course she is.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.596

as usual, no matter who he hurts.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.392

have been released from the tomb.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.334
- I've earned snarky.
- Ugh.

05:08.541 --> 05:12.477
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> How long are you gonna blame me for
turning your birth mother into a vampire?

05:12.679 --> 05:13.873
I'm not blaming you.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.574
I've accepted the fact you're a
psychopath with no redeeming qualities.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.175
Ouch.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.751
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> This isn't being productive.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.479
We're gonna figure out a way to deal
with Pearl and the vampires, yeah?

05:28.861 --> 05:30.988
I'm sorry,
he just makes me so cranky.

05:31.197 --> 05:34.758
- I know, he makes everybody cranky.
- So, what are we gonna do?

05:34.934 --> 05:37.095
<font color="#808080">STEFAN :</font> Damon and I
are gonna handle everything.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.703
What about me?
I can't sit here and do nothing.

05:39.906 --> 05:42.898
That's what you're gonna do.
That's what's gonna keep you safe.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.306
Which means nothing
if you're not safe too.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.705
I'm perfectly safe.

05:46.913 --> 05:49.882
I have Damon,
the self-serving psychopath, on my side.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.517
<font color="#808080">ELENA :</font> Ugh. Well, that's comforting.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.326
<font color="#808080">ANNA :</font> Okay, we have some time.
I'm not meeting my mom until later.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.893
<font color="#808080">JEREMY :</font> Wait. Does your mom know you're...?

06:04.063 --> 06:05.997
The fact that you think it's possible...

06:06.165 --> 06:09.931
...to keep that a secret from your own
family is proof that you're not ready.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.933
Not ready is a step up from no.

06:12.138 --> 06:14.163
And a million steps down from maybe.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.475
- I like your bracelet.
- Thanks, my, uh, sister got it for me.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.948
- Can I see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.386
Hmm.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.953
She doesn't know
you're hanging out with me?

06:31.157 --> 06:33.318
No, but I don't see
why it would be a problem.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.324
It's not like she knows what you are.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.287
I'd rather keep it our little secret.

06:40.566 --> 06:44.058
<font color="#808080">JEREMY :</font> You know, why don't you, um...?
Why don't you keep this?

06:45.705 --> 06:49.698
- Why would you give this to me?
- Because you like it.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.605
And I like you.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.477
You only like me
because of what you want from me.

I yelled at my mom last night.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.861

then she'll take off again.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.906
That's her M.O., just like Vicki...

07:26.112 --> 07:28.205

since she left.

07:28.414 --> 07:32.145

more than you can control your sister.

a little, you know?

07:35.221 --> 07:37.382
If she would try to try,
that would be okay.

I should go before the roads
get even worse from the storm.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.112

- I would go, but...
- But your life is valuable.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.465
- Yours, on the other hand, is...
- Stefan told me about your ring.

- What about it?
<font color="#808080">DAMON :</font> Let me recap.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.609
You tried to kill me,
I defended myself, you died.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.938
Then according to my brother,
your ring brought you back to life.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.671
Am I, uh, leaving anything out?

13:35.881 --> 13:38.042
Yeah, the part where I try
and kill you again.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.842
Only this time I don't miss.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.246

13:41.453 --> 13:45.617
- It's Stefan.
- I'm sorry, Elena.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.293
- It's not my problem.
- That's a shame.

the crowd can help you find your wife.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.393

14:31.570 --> 14:32.696
I don't.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.205
So you want a pity turn?

14:36.375 --> 14:37.706
I don't think so.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.237
You should turn me
because I don't have anything else.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.385
Do you even know
why we turn other people?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.683
It's not to give someone
a one-way ticket out of loner-hood.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.918
One, we need someone
to do our dirty work.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.460
Two, revenge.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.259
Three, boredom, but, you know,
that never turns out well.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.231
And then, you know,
there's the obvious one.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.696
That you love someone so much...

15:08.874 --> 15:11.866
...that you would do anything
to spend all eternity with them.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.708
Ahem. I'm sorry, but you don't fit
any of those categories yet.

15:23.355 --> 15:27.985
So, yeah, just make sure your thesis
is clear, and she'll love it.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.717
I'll see you later.

15:34.533 --> 15:37.093
- Mom, hey.
- Did you get everything?

15:37.269 --> 15:40.067
Yeah, the, uh, blood bank
was understaffed because of the rain.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.365
I was in and out.

15:41.573 --> 15:44.303
- Who's that you were talking to?
- A friend.

15:45.177 --> 15:46.940
Let's get home.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.341
You're not going out in that, are you?

15:49.515 --> 15:53.007

Route 5 is completely flooded.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.675

15:54.887 --> 15:58.254
- Mayor Lockwood, we have your table.
- Great.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.688
Mayor Lockwood, is it?

16:01.760 --> 16:04.957
I suppose it is treacherous outside.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.155
- My name is Pearl.
- Hi.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.801
This is my daughter, Anna.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.266

- Welcome.

This is my son, Tyler.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.136

16:18.344 --> 16:19.936
It would be a pleasure.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.781

is standing right here.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.921
Grow up, elections are coming.

16:30.122 --> 16:33.717
She's a constituent,
and a rich one from the looks of it.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.394
And you can tell all that
by looking at her ass?

16:36.562 --> 16:37.620
