00:02.437 --> 00:05.048
Hi, Jill, alcoholic.OTHERS: Hi, Jill.

00:05.092 --> 00:06.354
Things are good.

00:06.397 --> 00:07.877
I got my 30-day
chip yesterday.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.270
Some of y'all
weren't there,

00:09.313 --> 00:11.402
so I thought I'd give you
a chance to applaud.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.668
Oh, come on!
Carla got more applause

00:16.712 --> 00:18.322
for not sleeping with
her brother-in-law.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.109
Better.

00:23.806 --> 00:26.113
Anyway, my only complaint is,
now that I'm a newcomer again,

00:26.156 --> 00:28.332
I'm not supposed to date
for a year.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.987
I mean, the Lamborghini's
gassed up and fully detailed,

00:31.031 --> 00:33.555
but Marjorie won't let me
take it out of the garage.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.296
Give it time.

00:35.339 --> 00:38.690
Vroom-vroom, Marjorie!
Vroom-vroom!

00:38.734 --> 00:41.389
That's all I got.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.306
Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.OTHERS: Hi, Bonnie.

00:45.349 --> 00:47.438
Some of you may recall
my recent share

00:47.482 --> 00:50.137
about my fiancé's
17-year-old dog

00:50.180 --> 00:51.616
crossing over
the rainbow bridge.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.357
I wasn't here.
What happened?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.055
Dog went gay?

00:55.098 --> 00:57.100
He died.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.536
Aw.

00:58.580 --> 01:02.236
Yes "aw," total "aw,"
justified "aw."

01:02.279 --> 01:04.412
Thankfully, Samson died
peacefully in his sleep

01:04.455 --> 01:06.370
with a big ol' pork chop
in his belly.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.460
God knows
that's how I want to go.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.723
The problem is,
that was three weeks ago,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.595
and Adam is still devastated.

01:13.638 --> 01:17.512
I am relatively new to this--
what's it called, empathy?

01:19.253 --> 01:22.212
But shouldn't he be through
the five stages of grief by now?

01:22.256 --> 01:24.606
He's not shaving or showering;
he's wearing the same sweatshirt

01:24.649 --> 01:26.129
because it smells like his dog,

01:26.173 --> 01:28.436
which means my fiancé
smells like a dog.

01:28.479 --> 01:32.266
I mean, I want to continue
supporting him, but... [sighs]

01:32.309 --> 01:34.833
So I will say to you
what I can't say to him.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.488
All dogs go to heaven.
Move on!

01:37.532 --> 01:40.665
Thanks.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.146
Hi, Christy, alcoholic.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.366
OTHERS:
Hi, Christy.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.282
So, I've been having
some trouble with my boyfriend.

01:48.325 --> 01:51.415
Oh, no.
They're my Kate and William.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.896
His birthday weekend
didn't go well,

01:53.939 --> 01:56.681
so I've been
overthinking everything.

01:56.725 --> 01:59.162
He texted me "How ya doin'?"

01:59.206 --> 02:01.991
and I panicked
and sent him an emoji of a cow.

02:02.034 --> 02:03.645
I have no idea what it meant.

02:05.212 --> 02:07.257
Tonight, he wants to Skype,

02:07.301 --> 02:11.435
and I don't know whether it's
a sexy Skype or a breakup Skype.

02:11.479 --> 02:14.221
I mean, what do I wear?

02:14.264 --> 02:18.790
I don't want to be sitting there
in my nipple-less bra when...

02:18.834 --> 02:20.444
he dumps me.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.491
Oh, honey.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.536
[sobbing]:
Oh, God!

02:30.454 --> 02:33.414
This is empathy, right?

02:33.457 --> 02:35.459
♪

02:53.651 --> 02:55.610
Hey, honey.

02:56.872 --> 02:57.916
Excuse me.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.049
Are you my fiancé's son?

03:00.092 --> 03:02.834
Because I'm having
some forbidden feelings.

03:02.878 --> 03:05.010
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I showered and shaved.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.882
Clean hair, clean teeth,
clean underwear.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.013

03:08.057 --> 03:09.798
Wait, what's that I smell?

03:09.841 --> 03:13.976
[sniffs]
Mmm. It's nothing!

03:14.019 --> 03:18.459
I think I'm ready to wash
the dog bowls and put them away.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.592
Progress. Awesome, I love it.
Why don't you let me do it.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.899
You go watch some TV
and just relax.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.074
Thanks, babe.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.904
Hey, I was thinking maybe later
we could go out for dinner.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.122
We could go to that place

03:30.166 --> 03:31.602
where they flip the shrimp
in your mouth.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.213
Yeah, I like that place.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.258
Remember when I caught one
in my cleavage?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.869
Ah, everybody enjoyed that.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.224
[clanking]

03:46.530 --> 03:49.054
This one's got to soak.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.143
MAN [over TV]:
He's more than a dog.

03:51.187 --> 03:53.145
He's your best friend.

[dog barks]

03:55.104 --> 03:57.933
What are you watching?
What are you watching?

03:57.976 --> 03:59.935
Ah, it's just a
stupid commercial.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.937
["Best Friend" by Harry Nilsson

04:01.980 --> 04:05.810
[sighs] They're best friends.
They grew up together.

too old to jump in the truck.

Hey.

CHRISTY:
Hey.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.781
Well, I'm not spending
the night at Adam's.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.958
Weepy Sue is back
with a vengeance.

04:23.001 --> 04:26.178
I swear I've had all the sadness
I can take for a lifetime.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.689
Oh, no. What happened?

05:00.387 --> 05:04.913
It wasn't sexy Skype.
It was breakup Skype.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.871
Oh, honey.

05:06.915 --> 05:09.004
I'm sorry.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.701
At least you dressed
appropriately.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.792
I was ready for both.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.881
Oh, that's pretty.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.318
Thanks. It's new.

05:20.972 --> 05:24.149
[sighs] What did Patrick say?

05:24.193 --> 05:26.717
He asked me to go live with him.
[sniffles]

05:26.761 --> 05:28.719
He said he would
take care of me,

05:28.763 --> 05:30.634
that I wouldn't
have to work so much.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.593
That way, we could
spend more time together.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.247
But I said no,
so he broke up with me.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.032
Okay.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.469
Why the hell would you say no?

05:39.513 --> 05:42.472
I can't move three hours away.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.256
I have a life here.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.346
Ish.

05:46.389 --> 05:50.611
Look, it may not be
a great life, but it is a life.

05:50.654 --> 05:53.744
I'm not ready
to just give all that up.

05:53.788 --> 05:57.531
Well, I support you
no matter what, sweetie.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.011
Thanks, Mom.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.535
How 'bout I make you some tea,

06:01.578 --> 06:04.538
and you go watch some TV
and-and get your mind off it.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.583
I'd like that.

We now return to Love Actually.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.684
Nope.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.690
So how's Adam doing?Not great.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.563
Last night, I made him hot dogs
and he burst into tears.

06:29.606 --> 06:32.174
I mean, that is
a whisper-thin connection.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.437
Bonnie, everybody takes
a different amount of time

06:34.481 --> 06:35.656
to process grief.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.745
I know the guy's hurting,
and I love him,

06:37.788 --> 06:41.009
but sweet mother of pearl,
this is hard.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.664
I give him tissues, I hold him,
I make him soup.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.970
And what is the deal
with sad people and soup?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.624
He can't get enough soup.

06:47.668 --> 06:49.626
It's too depressing
when animals die.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.628
It's why I couldn't
become a vet.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.544
And yet you became
an emergency room nurse.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.546
What's your point?

06:56.590 --> 07:00.550
I think it's sexy when a man's
in touch with his emotions.

07:00.594 --> 07:04.336
Victor cried when my
calico Janis Joplin died.

07:04.380 --> 07:08.776

Hey, guys.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.873
I'm so sorry, Christy.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.136
I really thought you and Patrick
were gonna make it.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.790
Thanks, Wendy.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.793
At least it was a healthy end
to a healthy relationship.

07:29.013 --> 07:32.190
[voice breaks]: Healthiest
relationship I've ever had.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.932
Did he actually use the words
"I'll take care of you"?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.891
He did.What's wrong with you?!

07:36.934 --> 07:38.153
I don't know!

07:39.981 --> 07:41.765
You know what, Christy,
I have got just the thing

07:41.809 --> 07:43.245
to take your mind
off your troubles.

07:43.288 --> 07:46.988
Jill, again, I don't want
to steam my vagina.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.295
Okay, you didn't
give that a chance.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.561
But what I'm thinking is
we go to San Francisco

07:54.604 --> 07:57.477
and shop until that hole in
your heart is full with Gucci.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.522
That is so kind, but...

07:59.566 --> 08:00.828
Christy, you have always
been there for me.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.090
Let me do this for you.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.092
Well...

08:04.135 --> 08:06.268
I have always
wanted to know

08:06.311 --> 08:09.314
what it feels like to just
throw money at a problem.

08:09.358 --> 08:14.058
Trust me, it'll get you all
tingly like a steamed vagina.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.758

we're going shopping!

08:17.801 --> 08:19.150
No, just Christy.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.283
She's the one who's upset.

08:21.326 --> 08:25.853
I don't know if you've heard,
but my fiancé's dog just died.

[sportscast playing quietly

right where I left you.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.299
Hey.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.693
I've heard one way
to raise a man's spirits

08:39.736 --> 08:42.783
is to bring a third party
into the relationship.

08:42.826 --> 08:46.569
I'm not in the mood for--
Is it Louise from Trader Joe's?

08:48.615 --> 08:50.486
Close.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.794

It's a puppy!

And he's from
the Third Street Shelter.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.017
Bonnie, what are you doing?

09:00.061 --> 09:02.150
I'm trying to hand
you an adorable puppy

09:02.193 --> 09:03.847
that will make you happy.
You're welcome.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.763
I-I'm not,
I'm not gonna take him.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.243
But, honey, he's
got puppy breath

09:08.286 --> 09:10.462
and he wants you to
be his new daddy.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.510
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

09:14.554 --> 09:16.512
but I-I'm not ready
for another dog.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.079
Why not? You've got
those clean bowls.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.471
You're halfway there.

09:19.515 --> 09:20.995
I'm still grieving over Samson.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.779
It's only been
a couple of weeks.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.041
23 days.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.783
Bonnie, listen to me.

09:26.827 --> 09:30.831
I know to you I only lost a dog,
but to me, I lost a friend

09:30.874 --> 09:33.616
that got me through
the roughest time in my life.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.444
Well, you're gonna
have more rough times.

09:35.487 --> 09:38.708
I mean, you are
marrying me.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.232
And maybe this little
fella can help.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.321
I mean, I got stuck
behind a garbage truck

09:43.365 --> 09:44.975
on my way over here,
narrow street,

09:45.019 --> 09:47.325
no way to get around him,
and I glance over,

09:47.369 --> 09:50.894
and this guy is giving me
a very encouraging look.

This'll make you forget
you didn't get into law school.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.204
This'll make you
forget you live with your mom.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.945
Okay, if we're gonna
list all my problems,

10:41.989 --> 10:45.427
we're gonna run
out of dresses.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.038
Uh, these are
too expensive.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.388
I got to tell you, Jill,
I really appreciate this,

10:50.432 --> 10:53.217
but I'm just so much more
comfortable at an outlet mall.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.219
Outlet mall?

10:55.263 --> 10:59.223
Can't heal a sad person
with sad clothes.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.225
Nothing's gonna heal me.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.228
Why don't you try
talking about it?

11:04.272 --> 11:07.057
You know, I took
an online class in listening.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.407

want to talk about this.

you not blinking.

Come on, give me one chance.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.724
I really don't
want to do this.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.465
Trust me,
it'll make you feel better.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.901
Forgetting myself and go!

11:24.945 --> 11:28.165
Fine.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.255
I can't help thinking I made
a mistake with Patrick.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.822
Oh, hell no!

11:32.866 --> 11:35.390
So you think I did
the right thing?
No, shh!

11:35.433 --> 11:37.392
My ex-husband's new wife
just walked in.

11:37.435 --> 11:39.133
I didn't get a good look.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.918
Tell me if she lost
the baby weight.

11:43.224 --> 11:46.531
Wow, is she a
professional dancer?

11:46.575 --> 11:50.666
No, she's a professional
husband stealer.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.408
Slash highly-regarded
anesthesiologist.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.325
CHRISTY:
What are we doing?

11:57.368 --> 11:59.370
I can't let her see me.Why?

11:59.414 --> 12:00.763
'Cause she'll think
I'm stalking her.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.417
Why would she think that?

12:02.460 --> 12:05.463
'Cause I had a dark six
weeks where I totally was.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.642
Mmm. Isn't he cute?

12:10.686 --> 12:11.774
Yeah.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.429
You can name him
anything you want.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.387
Have you named one after
Steve Miller yet? Look at him.

12:16.431 --> 12:20.652
He's a joker, he's a smoker,
he's a midnight toker.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.480
He is adorable,

12:22.524 --> 12:24.787
but I'm pretty well established
as a cat person.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.484
Exactly.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.443
Eight cats and you're
the crazy cat lady.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.793
Eight cats and one dog,
you just love animals.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.623
Who rescued who,
am I right?

12:34.666 --> 12:38.409
Did you ask Wendy?
She seems lonely.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.454
Yeah, already tried her.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.847
She lives with
four other nurses.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.500
It's like a sitcom
over there.

12:44.241 --> 12:47.375
[sighs] I wish Adam
would just take the dog.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.029
Let me ask you something.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.031
Did you get this dog
to make him feel better

12:51.074 --> 12:52.293
or make you feel better?

12:52.336 --> 12:54.512
Aren't those
the same thing?

12:54.556 --> 12:56.514
Bonnie, you're gonna have to
learn to weather these storms

12:56.558 --> 12:58.865
if you want to be together
for the long haul.

12:58.908 --> 12:59.996
But he's the rock.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.129
Well, why can't you be the rock?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.608
Because I'm the river.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.829
The roaring river.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.310
I cut through the rock
and make the Grand Canyon,

13:09.353 --> 13:12.748
and people come from
miles around to behold me.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.619
Wow.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.535
I knew you wouldn't get it.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.537
Listen, in any
relationship,

13:19.581 --> 13:21.713
emotional support has
to be a two-way street.

13:21.757 --> 13:25.979
I'm not sure I buy that,
but someone's tail is wagging.

13:28.285 --> 13:33.638
[high-pitched]: "Oh, teach me
how to love, Marjorie."

13:33.682 --> 13:34.814
Nothing?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.728
[scoffs]

13:36.772 --> 13:40.471
You don't want to live with her.
She's the crazy cat lady.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.519
Look at her,
shopping for scarves

13:44.562 --> 13:46.477
like she's queen
of the world.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.872
Oh, here comes
the hat show.

13:51.439 --> 13:55.443
Hey, maybe she's shopping
'cause she's miserable, like me.

13:55.486 --> 13:58.620
Oh, that'd be great.
Go find out.

13:58.663 --> 14:01.231
What? I don't even know her.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.626
Look, you do this for me,
and I'll take you to that...

14:04.669 --> 14:06.410
[groans]:
Old Navy.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.719
Wait here.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.771
That's a lovely hat.

14:19.815 --> 14:21.948
You really think I can
pull off this color?

14:21.991 --> 14:24.385
Mm, pretty sure you could
pull off anything.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.516
Thank you.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.572
Ugh.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.574
Don't need
another one of these.

14:47.582 --> 14:50.846
Hi. Me again.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.154
Ugh.

14:54.197 --> 14:57.592
So, uh, you shopping
for a special occasion?

14:57.635 --> 14:59.681
Anniversary dinner.
Three years.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.030
Oh.

15:01.074 --> 15:04.468
Ah, I remember my
third anniversary.

15:04.512 --> 15:07.036
That's when you realize what
you're really married to.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.559
Not for us.

15:08.603 --> 15:11.475
My friends get sick of hearing
this, but we are so happy.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.999
It's like we just
started dating.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.915
Oh, that's sweet.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.483
But, uh, having a baby,
that's like R.I.P. sex life.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.572
Oh, no, we are fine
in that department.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.705
Your husband
sounds perfect.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.707
Oh, no, he is not perfect.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.665
Really? In what way?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.798
He sends me too many flowers.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.713
Of course he does.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.498
Anyway, it was
nice meeting you.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.499
You, too.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.284
Bye, Penelope.

15:37.327 --> 15:39.982
Uh, I didn't tell you
my daughter's name.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.680
Yes, you did.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.726
No, I didn't.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.946
You're tired.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.209
You're probably right.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.775
[chuckles]:
Bye.
Bye.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.695
[sobbing]

15:57.739 --> 16:00.350
[sniffling]

16:00.394 --> 16:03.832
Do you think maybe
I should drive?

16:03.875 --> 16:06.530
Oh, for God's sakes, Christy,
I can drive and cry.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.098
I do it all the time!

16:09.142 --> 16:12.188
Can we at least keep a foot
between us and that truck?

16:12.232 --> 16:15.931
It's got all those symbols
for explodey stuff.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.672
[clears throat]

16:17.715 --> 16:20.544
I'm sorry I ruined
our shopping vacay.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.590
Let's talk about
you and Patrick.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.548
No, I'm fine.

16:24.592 --> 16:27.029
I mean it, Christy.
Get my mind off me.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.596
Jill, I'd rather...

16:28.639 --> 16:32.600
Talk about Patrick!
Forgetting myself and go!

16:32.643 --> 16:34.123
Okay.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.125
Uh...

16:36.169 --> 16:39.476
I guess I'm worried
I'm just afraid to be happy.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.262
I mean, is it so crazy
to pick up my life

16:42.305 --> 16:44.264
and see where it goes
in Santa Cruz?

16:44.307 --> 16:47.876
They have law schools there.
They have meetings.

16:47.919 --> 16:51.271
When I met James,
I picked up my whole life

16:51.314 --> 16:54.143
and moved from Charleston to
California just to be with him.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.492
Really?

16:55.536 --> 16:59.105
You know what kind of
culture shock that is?

16:59.148 --> 17:02.238
I had to lose my accent
just to fit in with y'all.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.461
And it was worth it.

17:07.504 --> 17:10.638
And I'm not even willing
to move three hours from here

17:10.681 --> 17:12.814
to a lovely
seaside community.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.817
Where my mother doesn't live.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.949
What is wrong with me?

17:17.993 --> 17:20.300
I loved James so much,
I would've moved to the moon

17:20.343 --> 17:21.997
if he asked me to.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.913
And I wouldn't.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.657
Maybe I don't love Patrick.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.964
Sweetie, I think if
you have to ask the question,

17:33.008 --> 17:34.357
then you don't.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.534
But I really feel like I should.

17:37.578 --> 17:41.364
Just because he's a thousand
times better than anybody else

17:41.408 --> 17:44.019
you've ever dated
doesn't mean he's the one.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.240
Huh.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.373
I know that running into your
ex's wife ripped your guts out,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.767
but, boy, did it help me.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.812
You're welcome.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.165
[sniffles]

17:59.208 --> 18:03.125
Oh! And here come
your outlet stores.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.389
Mm, there's even a
Der Wienerschnitzel.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.435
Yay! Der Wienerschnitzel!

18:11.699 --> 18:13.657
Now, this show has some nudity,

18:13.701 --> 18:15.485
but nothing
you didn't already see

18:15.529 --> 18:18.184
when you barged in on me
taking a shower.

18:18.227 --> 18:19.446
[knock on door]

18:19.489 --> 18:22.405
Oh. You stay here,
I'll get the door.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.454
Hey, don't change the channel.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.676
Oh.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.983
Hey.
Hey.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.332
What brings you by?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.943
Well, what always brings me by
after we fight:

18:38.987 --> 18:40.467
I'm caving.

18:40.510 --> 18:43.948
Well, let me put
the puppy in his crate,

18:43.992 --> 18:45.950
so you don't
have to look at him.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.866
Bonnie, it's okay.

18:48.910 --> 18:53.349
I know I haven't been easy
to be around, and I'm sorry.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.525
I'm sorry, too.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.789
I shouldn't have tried to tell
you how you're supposed to feel

18:58.833 --> 19:00.878
or when you should be
done feeling it.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.273
If you need to be the raging
river, I can be the rock.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.536
Lucky for you,
I only go full river

19:06.580 --> 19:08.408
about once every ten years.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.454
Last time was when
Derek Jeter retired

19:11.498 --> 19:13.456
and they had that commercial
where he was

19:13.500 --> 19:17.591
walking through
the streets of New York.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.636
[voice breaks]:
The last hero.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.074
I think he likes you.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.339
[sighs]:
Oh.

19:26.382 --> 19:27.905
What's his name?

19:27.949 --> 19:30.343
Well, up until this point,
his name has been "No,"

19:30.386 --> 19:32.606
sometimes "Damn it," and
occasionally "Not on the rug."

19:34.260 --> 19:35.913
Do you like any of those names?

19:35.957 --> 19:39.613
Hmm? I didn't think so.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.268
How about... Gus?

19:42.311 --> 19:44.531
Does this mean
you're keeping him?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.620
I think it means
I'm stuck with both of you.

19:53.409 --> 19:54.497
How 'bout we call him
Sebastian?

19:54.541 --> 19:56.020
I already named him Gus.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.588
Butterscotch?Gus.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.200
Bon Jovi?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.549
Gus.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.246
We'll talk about it later.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.857
Oh!

20:06.901 --> 20:08.903
Who's the best boy?

20:08.946 --> 20:10.905
You're the best boy.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.733
Did you like your puppy chow?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.822
Was it too dry?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.650
Was it too wet?

20:16.693 --> 20:19.043
Or was it just right?

20:19.087 --> 20:21.916
[baby talking]

20:21.959 --> 20:25.659
Oh, I could snuggle with you all
day, but it's time for walkies.

20:25.702 --> 20:26.921
Now, it's wet outside,

20:26.964 --> 20:30.403
so Mommy's gonna
put on your raincoat.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.797
I know you don't like it,
but it's what's good for you.

20:33.841 --> 20:37.584
And that's my job,
to take care of you.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.413
Oh! [baby talking]

20:40.456 --> 20:43.372
I just love you so much.

20:44.678 --> 20:47.115
So you had it in you all along!
