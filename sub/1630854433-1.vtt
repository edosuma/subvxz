WEBVTT

01:14.867 --> 01:20.873
IF AN AIRCRAFT CANNOT FLY SAFELY
DUE TO LACK OF FUEL OR OTHER PROBLEMS

01:20.956 --> 01:26.962
THE PILOT MAKES A DECLARATION
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

01:30.674 --> 01:36.680
THIS PLANE THEN HAS FIRST PRIORITY TO LAND
BEFORE ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT.

01:41.852 --> 01:46.440
IN THE WORLD OF AVIATION,
IT IS LIKE PROCLAIMING MARTIAL LAW.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.692
ALL ELSE CEASES,

01:48.775 --> 01:52.696
AND THE PLANE'S NEEDS
SUPPLANT ANY OTHER ORDER.

02:08.795 --> 02:14.801
EMERGENCY DECLARATION

02:24.102 --> 02:26.813
We'll probably have to circle
a couple times before landing.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.774
Yes, traffic looks heavy.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.866
What? Someone you know?

02:38.867 --> 02:39.910
No.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.762
Which plane will have a lot of people
on it?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.805
Excuse me?

03:00.556 --> 03:03.433
It's summer, so maybe vacation spots?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.269
Do many people fly to Southeast Asia?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.814
What's your destination, sir?

03:09.106 --> 03:12.568
I want someplace far away,
where a lot of people go.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.320
What?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.197
Nothing, sir.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.869
How many people are on that 1:40 flight?

03:23.662 --> 03:26.582
We're not authorized to give out
that information.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.085
I'm just asking how many people.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.214
Why do you ask?

03:34.298 --> 03:37.634
I'm just curious. Is there a problem?

03:37.718 --> 03:43.432
No, it's just it might inconvenience
other passengers--

03:43.515 --> 03:45.100
Inconvenience them? How?

03:46.810 --> 03:48.729
What I mean is,

03:49.146 --> 03:53.358
we're not allowed to reveal
passengers' personal data.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.655
Hey.

03:58.739 --> 03:59.615
Yes?

03:59.698 --> 04:01.992
For god's sake, don't smile like that.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.828
You look like a whore.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.549
What loud get-together are they doing now?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.386
It's not that loud.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.097
It's community spirit.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.976
When it finishes, go get some meat.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.646
Meat? Just eat ox bone soup.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.023
Ox bone soup? Where?

04:33.357 --> 04:34.191
Did Mom go somewhere?

04:34.274 --> 04:38.654
On vacation, of course!
She's going without you.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.447
You always cancel.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.115
Do you hate vacations or something?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.325
Of course not.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.161
Why wouldn't I want to go?

04:47.037 --> 04:47.913
When will she be back?

04:47.996 --> 04:51.208
When the soup's gone!
I'm sick of it already.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.965
Gosh.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.592
This is two weeks' worth!

05:01.468 --> 05:06.056
Scratching again?
You need to stop yourself.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.100
- I know.
- Wait a second.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.810
I'll put on some ointment.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.771
Can I go to the restroom?

05:13.772 --> 05:14.982
The restroom?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.780
Sure, let's go.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.325
We've been waiting so long.
I'll go myself.

05:26.118 --> 05:27.077
Will you?

05:29.997 --> 05:33.834
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sky Korea will begin boarding shortly.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.839
Bring your own mirror!

05:40.340 --> 05:46.221
You will be boarding at Gate One.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.879
Why don't you answer your phone?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.174
I've got things to do at the airport, why?

06:22.257 --> 06:26.970
Is it my fault I can't go?
Something came up at work.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.515
That's what always happens!

06:29.598 --> 06:33.101
Always? It was just this one time.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.770
And the last time.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.940
Whatever.
Did you put the soup in the fridge?

06:39.399 --> 06:42.319
Of course, after you went to that trouble.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.739
As soon as it cooled,
I divided it into portions.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.783
It's 15 days' worth!

06:47.866 --> 06:51.745
Don't order delivery! I'm busy, bye!

06:52.955 --> 06:54.915
What a woman.

06:54.998 --> 06:59.002
Why does she always pick blue?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.469
Hello?

07:53.348 --> 07:54.850
Soo-min!

07:57.102 --> 07:58.270
Soo-min.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.232
- Dad!
- Why are you in here?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.234
I was so worried.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.862
What happened?

08:07.237 --> 08:09.281
Was there a line in the women's restroom?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.533
Thank goodness.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.205
Why so early, after working last night?

08:16.288 --> 08:17.372
You should sleep.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.375
A fight in my precinct,
had to cancel my vacation.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.962
Who gave us the watermelon?
Everyone's eating it.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.798
Two weeks of ox bone soup for me.

08:26.882 --> 08:30.093
Why should we go? You got the call.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.931
And you're closer! Oh, whatever.

08:35.933 --> 08:36.934
What is it?

08:37.476 --> 08:40.354
A bunch of school kids reported something.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.731
The head office wants us to check it out.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.066
What'd they report?

08:44.483 --> 08:48.445
Some idiot uploaded a video
threatening to attack a plane.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.989
The kids think it's their neighbor.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.950
Attack a plane?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.702
Yeah. Today, he says.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.080
Today?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.001
Thank you.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.395
Why's he talking in English?

09:22.312 --> 09:25.774
He didn't say which plane?

09:25.858 --> 09:28.569
No mention of which plane.

09:28.652 --> 09:32.322
He's just saying he'll attack a plane.

09:34.283 --> 09:38.704
You understood that?

09:38.787 --> 09:42.958
Such long sentences.
Is there someone we can ask?

09:43.041 --> 09:47.421
In English they all speak long sentences.
It's advanced English.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.423
I understood everything!

09:49.506 --> 09:51.466
It's just a prank.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.052
Who would announce it on the internet?

09:54.136 --> 09:56.305
And you think it's easy to attack a plane?

09:56.597 --> 09:59.141
With all the security
and checking they do.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.769
It's not far from here,

10:02.853 --> 10:03.937
- right?
- Huh?

10:05.898 --> 10:07.983
Might as well stop by.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.486
- I'll go myself.
- Sergeant, I'm sure it's just a prank!

10:11.570 --> 10:16.325
I know, I just feel like taking a walk.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.285
You're really going?

10:18.869 --> 10:21.496
Hey, where did Mom say she was going?

10:21.580 --> 10:23.290
I'm in class. Bye.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.125
Hey! Min-jung!

10:26.585 --> 10:28.045
Bear it a bit longer.

10:30.756 --> 10:35.093
The air is so clean there,
this will clear up really fast.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.513
How old are you? What a cute girl.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.056
Jesus.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.725
- Going on vacation?
- What?

10:43.644 --> 10:46.438
I don't see her mom. Do you have a wife?

10:49.066 --> 10:50.567
Where are you flying to?

10:54.530 --> 10:56.031
Ah, Hawaii.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.866
Let's go, Soo-min.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.786
You're divorced, aren't you?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.373
Do you know me?

11:04.456 --> 11:05.457
No.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.918
Then why stick your nose in our business?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.670
I'm just asking. Why?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.922
Why do you think?

11:12.464 --> 11:16.593
Grilling me about my wife.
Why do you care?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.311
What did the kid say?

11:26.395 --> 11:28.313
What is your damn problem?

11:28.397 --> 11:29.648
She said something about me.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.484
Are you insane? Leave us alone!

11:32.776 --> 11:34.319
Damned freak.

11:44.580 --> 11:49.835
This video, it's advanced English,
and you can't see his face.

11:50.544 --> 11:53.505
If you kids are just pulling a prank,

11:54.089 --> 11:56.592
then those four dollars ice creams,

11:57.551 --> 11:59.011
Haagen-Dazs.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.973
I'll make you pay me back for those.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.143
It's him! I recognized him right away.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.812
If you turn up the screen's brightness,
you can see.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.113
High-level English?
It's elementary school level.

12:22.034 --> 12:25.871
A rich neighborhood like this,
the kids get advanced instruction.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.916
Anything else strange about this guy?

12:28.999 --> 12:31.335
Was there? I don't think so.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.671
Last time he put his garbage
by someone else's home.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.507
So there was a big fight.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.678
A prank, right?

12:45.682 --> 12:49.394
Sarge, let's go back.
You've had your walk.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.188
These apartments may look old,

12:51.271 --> 12:54.983
but given the neighborhood,
a single unit costs four million dollars.

12:55.067 --> 12:58.403
If we get reported
for breaking and entering,

12:58.487 --> 13:00.531
You know what rich people are like.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.749
What's that smell?

13:10.832 --> 13:14.211
Trash.
Our home smells like that sometimes, too.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.088
- Let's go.
- You want to go in?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.090
No.

13:27.474 --> 13:31.019
Oh my, your door is open.

13:32.771 --> 13:33.939
Hello?

13:35.023 --> 13:37.568
When would you like the return flight
from Hawaii?

13:38.110 --> 13:40.821
I'll just take the flight there. One way.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.707
What's this?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.350
For my asthma.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.770
You can go.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.882
The weather looks bad from Japan on.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.220
Yes, the turbulence could be strong.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.472
We'll carry some extra fuel.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.225
And I'll do my best to avoid turbulence,

15:33.308 --> 15:37.312
but if we hit a rough patch,
I'll signal twice and announce it.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.064
Yes, thank you.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.972
Let me check your seat.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.642
Here. Take a seat.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.438
Welcome on board.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.108
Excuse me.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.925
- What did you want?
- Where did Mom go?

16:48.008 --> 16:49.468
Hawaii.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.220
Wait up!

17:03.440 --> 17:05.108
Let me check your ticket.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.486
This way, please.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.571
- Welcome.
- We almost missed the flight.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.822
- Sorry!
- That's okay.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.491
It's down this aisle.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.180
All 121 passengers are now on board.
We'll close the door.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.476
You can close the door now.
Thanks for your help.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.988
- Fasten seatbelts, please.
- We'll be taking off soon.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.073
Fasten your seatbelts.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.818
Here's a tranquilizer.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.488
Why didn't you send Yun-cheol in instead?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.866
I told him to, but he refused.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.659
I thought my heart had stopped.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.244
- Sergeant!
- What?

20:02.327 --> 20:03.537
Something's odd.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.749
We'll need an autopsy,
but there's a skull fracture.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.084
Lots of bleeding, too.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.129
Is that what killed him?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.715
What's strange is,

20:14.798 --> 20:17.217
that doesn't seem to be
the cause of death.

20:17.467 --> 20:22.097
Given the burst capillaries
and coughed up blood...

20:22.514 --> 20:23.640
What's that?

20:24.308 --> 20:26.685
It looks like poison.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.066
Yun-cheol, you put him on the wanted list?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.276
Yes.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.611
Hey, Sergeant.

20:36.195 --> 20:37.196
What?

20:37.279 --> 20:38.906
I think you'd better look at this.

20:54.046 --> 20:56.548
I'll go get some rest.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.342
Sure, rest up.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.142
I want to try that.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.188
Isn't this pretty? Look.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.023
Wow, that's pretty.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.111
Excuse me, sir.
I'm the chief flight attendant.

21:18.737 --> 21:21.490
You've been drinking a lot, are you okay?

21:21.573 --> 21:23.408
I'm fine, just give me more.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.160
Would you like a cool beverage?

21:25.244 --> 21:26.328
No, some alcohol.

21:26.411 --> 21:30.958
Sorry, but our regulations prohibit
the amount of alcohol--

21:31.041 --> 21:32.543
My dad's scared of flying.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.002
Soo-min!

21:34.086 --> 21:36.755
That's why he's drinking. He's scared.

21:36.839 --> 21:40.592
Don't be ridiculous.
Adults aren't scared of flying.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.313
Shall I bring what you've been having?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.317
Should I stop?

21:59.987 --> 22:01.029
I'll be fine.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.074
Very well.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.012
That's poison?

23:09.765 --> 23:12.226
No, it looks contagious.

23:12.976 --> 23:14.520
Contagious?

23:14.895 --> 23:17.564
The rats that don't touch the powder
are dying, too.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.274
Burst veins, internal bleeding...

23:19.358 --> 23:21.527
Looks like a virus.

23:24.696 --> 23:28.492
A virus can't last long in a solution.

23:29.076 --> 23:30.827
So it's bred in a culture,

23:31.995 --> 23:35.082
and then frozen in powder form.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.459
You got the test kit?

23:44.591 --> 23:47.761
The time keeps getting shorter.

23:48.262 --> 23:49.680
Getting shorter?

23:51.557 --> 23:55.644
He's measuring
how long it takes the virus to propagate.

23:55.727 --> 23:59.231
Trying to shorten the incubation period.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.109
What for?

24:02.609 --> 24:04.486
Why shorten the incubation period?

24:17.749 --> 24:19.001
Sergeant!

24:20.878 --> 24:22.171
He tests positive.

24:23.213 --> 24:25.507
He was killed by the virus.

24:43.317 --> 24:44.776
Going to the restroom?

24:46.904 --> 24:48.447
Are you?

24:52.576 --> 24:54.077
Are you scared of me?

24:54.953 --> 24:56.830
I'm not a bad person.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.710
Go ahead.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.513
I'm sorry, it's really urgent!

25:14.890 --> 25:17.226
Wow, you're a lucky kid.

25:33.242 --> 25:36.703
Call me as soon as you find anything.

25:38.664 --> 25:39.873
Got his location?

25:40.582 --> 25:41.792
Did he board a plane?

25:41.875 --> 25:45.462
This guy has no cell phone,
no credit cards.

25:45.546 --> 25:46.547
We can't trace him.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.174
Let's go to the immigration office.
How long will it take?

25:54.721 --> 25:55.806
What is this?

25:57.558 --> 25:59.643
What the hell?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.275
- Do you have a pen?
- Hey!

26:06.358 --> 26:08.151
- Can I borrow one?
- I'll bring you one, sir.

26:08.235 --> 26:10.028
- Yes?
- The restroom there...

26:10.404 --> 26:12.990
There was someone in business,
so I went to economy,

26:13.073 --> 26:15.742
but something's falling from the ceiling!

26:16.285 --> 26:18.328
How cheap can you get?

26:18.412 --> 26:21.999
My apologies, sir.
I'll check it immediately.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.793
So why'd you go to economy?

26:25.169 --> 26:27.379
The one here was occupied.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.423
Stop brushing off.

26:53.030 --> 26:55.616
- Why won't she answer?
- The phone is powered off.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.952
Please tell me he's not flying to Hawaii.

26:59.036 --> 27:00.412
What about Hawaii?

27:01.079 --> 27:02.539
The light's green. Go.

27:29.066 --> 27:30.067
What's that?

27:30.150 --> 27:31.151
What?

27:31.735 --> 27:33.403
It's the airline's wi-fi.

27:33.487 --> 27:35.906
You need a credit card,
nine dollars an hour.

27:35.989 --> 27:39.535
Crazy expensive, and super slow.
Such a rip-off.

27:39.618 --> 27:42.579
I mean this video. What is it?

27:45.207 --> 27:50.128
My friend sent me this,
trying to freak me out.

27:50.212 --> 27:53.340
This guy's threatening a terrorist attack
on a plane.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.467
Can I take a look?

27:56.301 --> 27:57.344
- What?
- Let me see.

27:57.427 --> 27:58.470
Sure.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.148
I'm sure it's a prank.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.236
Where did Soo-min go?

28:19.491 --> 28:20.742
Soo-min?

28:22.452 --> 28:24.288
Soo-min, why are you here?

28:25.372 --> 28:26.456
What's wrong?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.001
What happened?

28:35.257 --> 28:38.510
- It's too dark to see.
- I'm sure it's him!

28:39.386 --> 28:42.472
Imagine him in a suit. It's identical!

28:44.892 --> 28:48.562
He smuggled something onto the plane
in his armpit.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.607
I don't think it's an explosive.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.360
But it could be a weapon.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.279
Like a small knife.

28:58.614 --> 29:00.657
You know what he told my daughter?

29:01.033 --> 29:03.076
Tell her. What did the man say?

29:03.577 --> 29:06.788
It's okay, Soo-min. You can tell her.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.545
What did that man say?

29:16.507 --> 29:20.052
That everyone here

29:21.512 --> 29:23.138
is going to die.

29:41.323 --> 29:43.200
Excuse me, sir.

29:43.867 --> 29:44.743
Yes?

29:44.826 --> 29:49.623
I'm sorry,
but can I see your ID or business card?

29:49.915 --> 29:51.291
Why all of a sudden?

29:51.834 --> 29:57.714
A passenger claimed
you said something improper to her.

29:58.257 --> 30:00.467
What did I say?

30:07.099 --> 30:09.101
Ah.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.155
He's a scientist.

30:22.239 --> 30:23.490
A scientist?

30:24.032 --> 30:26.159
He says
he's attending a conference in Hawaii,

30:26.618 --> 30:29.121
and denies saying anything.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.665
But your daughter
doesn't seem to be lying.

30:31.748 --> 30:36.587
We'll keep a close eye on him.
Try not to worry.

30:49.099 --> 30:53.145
Si-young, that steak in the oven,
can you take it out?

30:53.645 --> 30:54.730
Sure.

30:56.315 --> 30:59.610
That's for the copilot,
and seaweed soup for the pilot.

30:59.943 --> 31:01.862
He doesn't eat meat.

31:02.446 --> 31:03.488
Right.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.711
- I brought your meals.
- Thanks.

31:17.794 --> 31:21.340
Seaweed soup for you, Captain,
and steak for the copilot.

31:21.423 --> 31:24.510
- Thank you.
- Huh? I want steak, too!

31:24.593 --> 31:26.136
But you don't eat meat.

31:26.220 --> 31:29.181
That's when I was taking herbal medicine.

31:29.264 --> 31:32.392
Nearly drove me crazy.

31:32.476 --> 31:36.897
I'm always catching colds,
and they last forever.

31:37.189 --> 31:38.649
- I'll bring you steak, then.
- Thanks.

31:38.732 --> 31:41.318
No, don't bother.
You take this, I'll have soup.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.445
- Here you go.
- It's no problem to change it.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.405
No need for that.

31:45.656 --> 31:47.658
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

31:49.368 --> 31:50.369
Oh, my.

31:53.622 --> 31:56.208
How many hours will you fly this month?

32:00.087 --> 32:02.965
He boarded a flight. Ryu Jin-seok.

32:03.048 --> 32:06.635
- Not someone with the same name?
- The ID numbers match.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.095
Where...

32:08.554 --> 32:11.849
Where's it going? Which flight?

32:13.225 --> 32:16.687
KI501. To Honolulu.

32:19.565 --> 32:20.941
Oh, thank god!

32:21.567 --> 32:23.318
It's okay.

32:28.991 --> 32:32.327
Wait, Honolulu is... in Hawaii?

32:32.786 --> 32:36.206
- What?
- It's Hawaii, right?

32:40.043 --> 32:42.546
- Jung Hye-yoon.
- Why are you going on about Hawaii?

32:42.629 --> 32:43.672
What?

32:44.673 --> 32:45.799
What is it?

32:45.883 --> 32:47.009
Well...

32:47.092 --> 32:48.385
What's wrong?

32:49.970 --> 32:53.265
So, can you turn back the flight?

32:53.348 --> 32:55.851
You're the airline.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.562
You can do it, right?

32:58.645 --> 33:00.230
Let go of me! What do you know?

33:00.314 --> 33:02.858
We're police officers.

33:02.941 --> 33:07.154
No, it'll be best just to grab him.
Grab him on the plane. Okay?

33:07.237 --> 33:09.323
Listen up! Tell the security guard--

33:09.406 --> 33:12.117
There's no guard, it's not a bank.

33:12.201 --> 33:14.661
Why no security guard?

33:14.995 --> 33:17.206
Airplanes don't have them.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.958
You should've followed through
on your swing last time.

33:20.042 --> 33:23.086
I'm telling you, I did.

33:24.338 --> 33:27.341
Why do you keep scratching yourself?

33:27.549 --> 33:30.219
What is this? Why's it so itchy?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.471
And I've got the chills.

33:32.554 --> 33:34.014
Did you eat something rotten?

33:34.389 --> 33:36.767
What did you eat this time?

33:41.522 --> 33:44.733
You've got no evidence,
if you keep on like this--

33:44.816 --> 33:48.612
A man with a body in his home
made a terror threat!

33:48.695 --> 33:51.782
If we start a scene in the plane,
passengers could get hurt--

33:51.865 --> 33:54.326
This is much more serious than that!

33:54.785 --> 33:57.746
Seeing that video...

33:59.456 --> 34:03.043
This is no ordinary criminal.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.127
You know about viruses?

34:04.211 --> 34:05.504
- Yes.
- Biological terror.

34:05.587 --> 34:06.839
That's what this is.

34:06.922 --> 34:09.508
If we don't move fast, it'll be too late.

34:09.758 --> 34:12.636
If you're not convinced,
I'll take full responsibility.

34:13.387 --> 34:15.180
So before it's too late...

34:18.559 --> 34:19.935
I can't believe this.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.777
Blood?

34:38.495 --> 34:39.538
My eye!

34:40.163 --> 34:41.123
Help!

34:41.874 --> 34:42.875
Over here!

34:44.084 --> 34:47.004
Doctor! Is there a doctor?

34:47.379 --> 34:48.255
Doctor!

34:49.715 --> 34:51.175
- Pil-ho!
- Are you okay?

34:51.258 --> 34:52.551
- Hey!
- What's going on?

34:52.634 --> 34:54.720
Is there a doctor?

34:56.221 --> 34:57.222
Help.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.224
Is there a doctor?

35:00.350 --> 35:02.269
Any doctor here?

35:02.352 --> 35:03.353
A doctor...

35:03.937 --> 35:06.565
A doctor... Any doctor here?

35:07.024 --> 35:08.025
A doctor?

35:13.363 --> 35:15.532
- Oh my...
- Pil-ho!

35:15.616 --> 35:16.658
Stewardess!

35:20.787 --> 35:22.623
Wait, I'm a doctor.

35:35.761 --> 35:37.179
He's dead.

35:37.763 --> 35:39.181
- What?
- No.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.977
Excuse me.

36:01.870 --> 36:03.622
What's this? A terror attack?

36:03.705 --> 36:05.165
Is the satellite phone working?

36:05.249 --> 36:07.417
It must be down, if they sent it as text.

36:07.501 --> 36:08.752
Check it.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.258
Where are you going?

36:16.593 --> 36:18.178
Here it is, Ryu Jin-seok.

36:19.096 --> 36:20.639
- I'll go check.
- Okay.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.266
I said where are you going?

36:24.351 --> 36:27.479
- You did this, right?
- What did I do? Asshole.

36:27.771 --> 36:29.189
It was you, bastard!

36:29.273 --> 36:31.567
Let go of me!

36:33.861 --> 36:37.656
A male passenger in section 36 Charlie
has died.

36:54.965 --> 36:56.133
You did something, right?

36:56.216 --> 36:59.261
You hid something in your armpit.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.096
What are you doing?

37:02.556 --> 37:03.640
Look!

37:05.184 --> 37:06.268
What's this?

37:06.560 --> 37:07.895
What did you hide here?

37:10.772 --> 37:13.317
You said you'd kill everyone!

37:14.276 --> 37:15.527
You freak!

37:15.611 --> 37:17.279
What's going on here?

37:18.030 --> 37:19.990
You need to catch him!

37:29.708 --> 37:31.293
Mr. Ryu Jin-seok, right?

37:37.299 --> 37:40.260
Date of birth, December 1, 1985?

37:44.431 --> 37:46.517
Sorry, but can I see an ID?

37:48.602 --> 37:52.189
You're Ryu Jin-seok! You speak Korean!

37:52.940 --> 37:53.982
What?

37:57.945 --> 37:59.863
- Shit!
- Grab him!

38:01.782 --> 38:02.866
Grab him!

38:07.037 --> 38:08.163
Soo-min, look out!

38:08.830 --> 38:10.415
Soo-min, it's okay.

38:17.089 --> 38:18.841
Grab his hand!

38:20.384 --> 38:21.885
Help me!

38:29.560 --> 38:30.686
Help!

39:17.691 --> 39:18.692
Over here!

39:19.693 --> 39:22.070
Something just came! It's from the plane?

39:22.154 --> 39:25.908
Ryu Jin-seok has been isolated,
but one passenger has died.

39:26.950 --> 39:31.205
A man in his 40s,
coughing up blood and covered in blisters.

39:32.664 --> 39:34.041
Sergeant, are you okay?

39:34.124 --> 39:38.128
Get something sweet like chocolate.

39:38.212 --> 39:39.213
I'm okay.

39:41.882 --> 39:43.050
Excuse me!

39:43.800 --> 39:45.135
Via technical exchanges,

39:45.219 --> 39:49.598
Korean firms can obtain
C-ITS certification...

39:51.058 --> 39:54.853
C-IS...
Why can't I memorize anything today?

39:54.937 --> 39:56.730
Did I make it too difficult?

39:56.813 --> 39:58.440
No, these terms...

39:58.524 --> 39:59.608
Minister Kim!

40:04.279 --> 40:05.739
We are currently gathering
more information.

40:05.822 --> 40:08.450
Please don't be alarmed,
and wait in your seats.

40:08.534 --> 40:09.785
We'll be fine, right?

40:10.577 --> 40:12.120
Sure, it'll be okay.

40:12.204 --> 40:13.580
Let's get some sleep.

40:13.664 --> 40:15.374
He was sprinkling something.

40:15.457 --> 40:17.626
What? It wasn't a knife?

40:17.709 --> 40:20.921
- Was it a knife?
- Was anybody hurt?

40:21.004 --> 40:22.256
They said not.

40:22.506 --> 40:25.342
Only a few hours left, we'll be fine.

40:31.723 --> 40:32.724
Hey!

40:32.808 --> 40:33.934
Sorry.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.604
Long time no see.

40:38.021 --> 40:39.147
Right.

40:40.482 --> 40:42.568
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

40:44.611 --> 40:45.612
No.

40:49.783 --> 40:53.287
Did that guy carry out some terror attack?

40:54.079 --> 40:55.956
He threatened to.

41:01.545 --> 41:05.424
He's suspected of murder, too,
so we've detained him for now.

41:05.507 --> 41:08.760
I knew
there was something weird about him.

41:08.844 --> 41:11.221
From the first time I saw him.

41:11.305 --> 41:12.639
I saw you before.

41:15.517 --> 41:16.602
At the airport.

41:18.395 --> 41:22.107
I wasn't sure,
but I never knew you were on this plane.

41:22.191 --> 41:25.235
Oh, really? I didn't see you.

41:25.319 --> 41:27.487
- Why didn't--
- I hoped I was wrong.

41:29.990 --> 41:32.242
Because I never wanted to see you again.

41:41.084 --> 41:42.336
It was in here.

41:44.087 --> 41:49.468
The man who died said
that powder was falling on his head.

41:49.551 --> 41:51.762
- Powder?
- Yes.

42:32.553 --> 42:35.806
Want to cover your mouth?
So you don't catch a cold.

42:54.908 --> 42:57.411
They look high-ranking.

42:59.913 --> 43:01.331
She's arriving now.

43:01.415 --> 43:04.710
We set up an operations team
at the airline.

43:04.793 --> 43:06.295
I'll call you back.

43:12.384 --> 43:13.468
Thank you.

43:13.552 --> 43:14.595
What's the situation?

43:14.678 --> 43:16.805
The copilot is keeping us updated.

43:16.889 --> 43:19.933
For now, apart from the one fatality,
everything is calm.

43:20.017 --> 43:23.187
What a nightmare.
Shouldn't the plane turn back?

43:23.270 --> 43:24.897
We're discussing it,

43:24.980 --> 43:28.358
but it seems urgent
to get them off that plane,

43:28.442 --> 43:31.069
so we're talking to the US
about finding a nearby airport.

43:31.153 --> 43:33.405
Since there's never been
a bioterror attack in a plane before--

43:33.488 --> 43:36.867
Shouldn't we call a press conference?

43:36.950 --> 43:40.579
Once things become clearer.
Let's analyze the situation first.

43:41.288 --> 43:43.832
I'm Park Tae-su from the President's
Crisis Management Center.

43:44.541 --> 43:45.626
Okay.

43:49.213 --> 43:50.547
Why don't you come back?

43:50.631 --> 43:53.800
- Something strange is going on.
- What?

43:53.884 --> 43:56.845
The suspect spread something
in the restroom and cabin,

43:57.346 --> 43:59.598
then an exposed passenger died,

44:00.140 --> 44:03.227
and many passengers have started coughing.

44:03.894 --> 44:07.231
I also went inside the restroom,
so I'm calling, just in case.

44:07.314 --> 44:09.733
You feel okay?

44:09.816 --> 44:14.446
I'm okay,
but the attendant Si-young has a fever,

44:14.530 --> 44:16.657
and Captain Jang
isn't feeling well either.

44:16.740 --> 44:20.577
So I think for now
it's better if you stay alone.

44:21.036 --> 44:22.538
Okay, call me.

44:33.632 --> 44:36.802
These photos are from the plane.

44:36.885 --> 44:39.429
The blisters and bleeding

44:40.389 --> 44:43.684
match what we saw on the corpse
at Ryu's house.

44:44.017 --> 44:47.896
Ryu already dispersed the white powder
in the plane,

44:47.980 --> 44:50.899
and if we have the first casualty,

44:50.983 --> 44:53.485
that means the virus is spreading.

44:53.569 --> 44:56.154
So the infections will multiply rapidly.

44:56.238 --> 45:01.326
Not only that,
this aircraft is a 20-year-old model,

45:01.660 --> 45:04.913
and the ventilation reuses air
from inside the plane.

45:04.997 --> 45:07.374
So the virus,
which appears to be airborne,

45:07.457 --> 45:08.917
will circulate.

45:09.793 --> 45:11.587
It's the ideal environment for a virus.

45:11.670 --> 45:14.047
They're saying it's a terrorist attack.

45:14.131 --> 45:15.549
Everyone stay calm.

45:16.717 --> 45:20.429
Don't let the passengers see you
looking worried, okay?

45:21.221 --> 45:22.222
Yes, ma'am.

45:24.433 --> 45:25.434
Are you okay?

45:26.518 --> 45:28.145
I'm a bit dizzy.

45:28.770 --> 45:31.565
If I rest for a sec, I'll be okay.

45:31.648 --> 45:32.983
Can you get up?

45:35.652 --> 45:40.866
Is there any existing virus
with similar traits?

45:41.909 --> 45:43.994
To prepare a response--

45:44.077 --> 45:46.538
It's an intentional act of bioterrorism,

45:46.622 --> 45:50.334
so it'll be hard to find
anything comparable in nature.

45:50.667 --> 45:54.171
And far more lethal.

45:55.506 --> 45:58.008
What do we do? I'm scared.

45:58.091 --> 46:01.762
Hey, don't be a wuss! It'll be fine.

46:02.679 --> 46:05.682
It's okay. I'm scared too.

46:05.766 --> 46:07.476
I SAW YOUR POST ON INSTAGRAM.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.729
Reporters are texting like crazy.

46:12.314 --> 46:16.318
The video I took,
I uploaded it to Instagram.

46:16.693 --> 46:19.655
But the wi-fi is so slow.

46:19.738 --> 46:22.032
Too many people using the internet.

46:22.115 --> 46:24.243
Try again in 2 or 3 minutes.

46:24.326 --> 46:26.787
Ryu Jin-seok worked
for a pharmaceutical company?

46:27.746 --> 46:30.249
Yes, he quit four years ago.

46:30.791 --> 46:35.212
He was head of microbiology
at the multinational firm BRICOM.

46:36.255 --> 46:40.634
We tried contacting them to get more info,

46:40.717 --> 46:44.429
but their headquarters are overseas,
and they're not very cooperative.

46:44.513 --> 46:46.849
They say he quit years ago,

46:46.932 --> 46:50.185
and this incident has
nothing to do with them.

46:50.477 --> 46:53.647
They keep repeating
they have nothing to tell us.

46:53.730 --> 46:58.068
The situation is so desperate,
and you're just going to let it go?

46:59.069 --> 47:01.405
Use the power of the state if you have to.

47:01.488 --> 47:05.742
Yes, but we have no evidence
directly linking them to this case,

47:05.826 --> 47:08.829
and if we investigate
or force them to testify,

47:08.912 --> 47:10.247
it could cause problems.

47:10.330 --> 47:14.835
We are public servants.
It's our job to take responsibility.

47:15.252 --> 47:17.754
I'll try another channel.

47:17.838 --> 47:21.425
Ryu's mother was a microbiologist, too.

47:21.508 --> 47:24.595
She published several papers
in overseas scientific journals.

47:25.262 --> 47:29.558
They went to the US in 1994
and returned in 2002.

47:29.641 --> 47:34.396
She finished her Ph.D.
just as Ryu entered school,

47:34.479 --> 47:37.024
so it seems they went for Ryu's education.

47:37.107 --> 47:38.233
Can you contact her?

47:38.317 --> 47:40.986
She died of natural causes in February.

47:42.738 --> 47:44.573
Let's negotiate with Ryu.

47:45.949 --> 47:49.786
This is an unknown virus
with a short incubation period.

47:50.245 --> 47:52.581
If he just wanted to kill people,
he could do it on land.

47:52.664 --> 47:55.876
He chose a plane,
so he must have some other goal.

47:56.168 --> 47:59.296
And the internet threat suggests
he likes an audience.

47:59.796 --> 48:02.716
If he wants something,
we can give it to him.

48:03.133 --> 48:05.928
If not, all those...

48:06.762 --> 48:09.681
It's too dangerous for those passengers.

48:20.609 --> 48:21.985
Can you hear me?

48:23.904 --> 48:24.947
Yes.

48:34.790 --> 48:36.083
Mr. Ryu Jin-seok?

48:37.292 --> 48:38.502
What?

48:40.003 --> 48:43.966
Can you tell us why you did all of this?

48:45.092 --> 48:46.176
Did what?

48:46.635 --> 48:48.387
Do you want something?

48:49.346 --> 48:51.139
You must have a reason.

48:51.557 --> 48:53.642
So you'll give it to me?

48:54.476 --> 48:58.438
Right now, officials from the government

48:58.522 --> 49:00.357
are listening to this call.

49:01.567 --> 49:03.318
Tell him we'll do what he wants.

49:06.488 --> 49:08.115
Do you want something?

49:09.366 --> 49:10.576
They say they'll do it.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.041
Then listen up.

49:18.125 --> 49:20.043
I'll tell you clearly.

49:23.255 --> 49:27.342
The people on this plane,

49:28.385 --> 49:30.721
I want them all to die.

49:34.683 --> 49:36.185
Shall I repeat myself?

49:38.020 --> 49:43.108
I want everyone on this plane to die!

49:45.027 --> 49:46.570
Every single one!

49:50.741 --> 49:51.909
Why?

49:53.035 --> 49:54.494
It seems like fun.

49:55.954 --> 49:57.664
It's fun when people die?

50:00.626 --> 50:05.797
No. It's fun seeing people trapped,
dying one by one.

50:05.881 --> 50:06.965
Like rats.

50:07.049 --> 50:08.133
This is a plane!

50:08.217 --> 50:11.220
So there's nowhere to run,
it will be chaos!

50:11.803 --> 50:14.806
Running won't save you.

50:15.390 --> 50:17.601
- You crazy bastard!
- Sir!

50:17.684 --> 50:19.061
Tell him to stay calm.

50:20.270 --> 50:23.941
Why? It's all just words.

50:24.274 --> 50:26.443
What nonsense is this?

50:26.860 --> 50:28.487
You know
how many people are on this plane?

50:28.570 --> 50:30.405
You think I wanted this?

50:31.365 --> 50:36.370
You think I wanted to do this?

50:40.415 --> 50:41.583
Ryu Jin-seok!

50:59.518 --> 51:01.353
You need to learn

51:01.812 --> 51:05.065
just how much it hurts, you garbage.

51:05.148 --> 51:07.442
Stop this nonsense and tell me.
Where's the treatment?

51:07.526 --> 51:09.736
Where's the vaccine?
You must want to live!

51:13.198 --> 51:14.491
Tell me!

51:31.133 --> 51:33.427
You think I boarded this plane
planning to live?

51:35.262 --> 51:39.474
I boarded it to die. With all of you.

54:20.802 --> 54:23.096
Idle! Speed brake!

54:26.099 --> 54:27.434
Pull up.

55:20.362 --> 55:21.572
Are you okay?

56:01.111 --> 56:02.779
Ryu Jin-seok is dead.

56:08.368 --> 56:09.828
Captain Won is dead.

56:10.871 --> 56:15.000
And the terrorist,
Ryu Jin-seok is also dead.

56:15.083 --> 56:17.002
What did you say?

56:29.765 --> 56:32.226
He said he's not hurt,
he just passes out sometimes.

56:32.726 --> 56:35.270
I think he has fear of flying, too.

56:35.354 --> 56:38.857
Fear of flying? Not him, surely.

56:38.941 --> 56:39.816
What?

56:39.900 --> 56:43.195
He used to be a famous pilot.

57:01.797 --> 57:03.215
DEATH REPORTED ON FLIGHT TO HONOLULU
Minister.

57:03.298 --> 57:04.633
SUSPECTED TERRORISM
The story broke.

57:05.968 --> 57:07.344
This just in.

57:07.427 --> 57:08.762
A death has occurred...

57:08.846 --> 57:10.681
POSSIBLE TERRORISM ON SKY KOREA 501

57:10.764 --> 57:13.433
...on a Sky Korea flight
from Incheon to Honolulu.

57:13.517 --> 57:19.022
Even more disturbing,
the presumed cause is terrorism.

57:19.731 --> 57:24.653
This video was taken by a passenger
on the plane

57:24.736 --> 57:27.948
and sent
via the airline's internet service.

57:28.031 --> 57:30.701
The suspect Ryu being detained
in this video

57:30.784 --> 57:35.122
threatened an attack on a plane yesterday.

57:35.205 --> 57:39.501
DEATH CAUSED BY SUSPECTED TERROR

57:39.585 --> 57:43.130
This is all the info we have
at the moment,

57:43.213 --> 57:46.049
but according to passengers' reports
from the plane,

57:46.133 --> 57:49.011
the plane is experiencing
violent turbulence

57:49.094 --> 57:54.308
and passengers are in a state
of extreme terror and confusion.

57:54.391 --> 57:55.767
Despite this,

57:55.851 --> 58:01.231
neither the airline nor the government
have responded to calls for clarification.

58:03.984 --> 58:06.570
As reported in the press,

58:06.653 --> 58:10.574
the suspect Ryu uploaded a terror threat
on the internet,

58:10.657 --> 58:15.537
and carried out a biological terror attack
on the plane.

58:15.871 --> 58:19.750
This virus is highly contagious

58:19.833 --> 58:23.337
and in contrast
to naturally occurring diseases,

58:23.420 --> 58:26.006
- appears to be extremely lethal.
- Is he that person from before?

58:26.089 --> 58:27.674
He's dead?

58:27.758 --> 58:30.469
We have learned that the terrorist himself

58:30.552 --> 58:32.721
has died of the virus,

58:33.180 --> 58:36.725
and Captain Won Dong-yeon died
after being infected.

58:37.226 --> 58:39.186
Shouldn't we check on this?

58:39.811 --> 58:41.855
Hey, stewardess! Stewardess!

58:41.939 --> 58:43.023
- The government is
- Stewardess!

58:43.106 --> 58:45.317
cooperating with the US

58:45.692 --> 58:47.903
to land the plane

58:47.986 --> 58:52.449
and address the situation
as quickly as possible.

58:52.533 --> 58:55.327
Dear passengers,
family members and citizens,

58:55.619 --> 58:57.371
we ask for your trust...

58:57.454 --> 59:00.457
- It's a virus? Extremely lethal?
- ...as we work to find a solution.

59:00.541 --> 59:03.585
The pilot got infected and died!

59:05.587 --> 59:06.880
Then are we all going to get infected?

59:06.964 --> 59:09.299
We'll all get infected?

59:09.383 --> 59:11.426
Why won't the phone work?

59:13.262 --> 59:15.097
Because everyone's calling.

59:15.681 --> 59:17.140
Everyone's trying.

59:17.891 --> 59:20.686
Pil-ho died of that virus.
I was next to him!

59:20.769 --> 59:21.812
Are you serious?

59:22.187 --> 59:23.897
- Stewardess!
- I'm sorry.

59:23.981 --> 59:25.399
- Just a minute.
- Wait!

59:25.482 --> 59:26.608
Stop!

59:26.984 --> 59:30.487
Tell us something!
Don't we need to get off?

59:32.531 --> 59:35.951
Meanwhile, police have turned
the investigation public

59:36.034 --> 59:39.079
and released details about the suspect.

59:39.162 --> 59:41.415
His name is Ryu Jin-seok.

59:41.498 --> 59:46.753
He worked as a senior researcher
at a multinational pharmaceutical firm.

59:46.837 --> 59:47.796
As of now,

59:47.880 --> 59:52.593
a Counterterrorism Task Force
has been set up at the airport,

59:52.676 --> 59:57.848
and family members of passengers
are arriving at a nearby meeting room.

59:57.931 --> 1:00:00.559
Check all CCTVs near that house,

1:00:00.893 --> 1:00:03.061
and see if there were any visitors.

1:00:03.145 --> 1:00:04.855
It's chaos here!

1:00:04.938 --> 1:00:07.316
I don't know how the location got leaked

1:00:07.816 --> 1:00:11.862
but even if we say it's safe,
it's pandemonium here.

1:00:11.945 --> 1:00:13.947
A disinfectant truck just arrived.

1:00:15.115 --> 1:00:17.618
Dad, is Mom on that plane?

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.119
A call came from her.

1:00:19.536 --> 1:00:21.246
You can call from a plane?

1:00:21.330 --> 1:00:23.207
Yes, on that one.

1:00:23.290 --> 1:00:25.459
She just said a few words,
then it disconnected.

1:00:25.542 --> 1:00:26.668
Where are you?

1:00:27.294 --> 1:00:31.256
They said the families are at the airport,
so I'm going there.

1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:33.258
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

1:00:33.634 --> 1:00:36.386
She never catches a cold.

1:00:36.637 --> 1:00:40.349
We can't get to the plane,
this is driving me crazy.

1:00:40.724 --> 1:00:43.060
Where did that bastard work?

1:00:43.393 --> 1:00:44.228
BRICOM.

1:00:44.311 --> 1:00:47.064
If they won't cooperate,
it means they're hiding something.

1:00:47.356 --> 1:00:49.608
Otherwise, why not talk?

1:00:52.444 --> 1:00:55.239
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Just dizzy.

1:00:56.573 --> 1:00:57.950
I'm just dizzy.

1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:01.161
Hey!

1:01:01.828 --> 1:01:04.122
- Please call someone!
- Stewardess!

1:01:05.123 --> 1:01:07.543
No, I'm okay.

1:01:07.876 --> 1:01:09.503
Si-young's in trouble!

1:01:14.007 --> 1:01:15.259
Si-young!

1:01:17.803 --> 1:01:19.179
Si-young!

1:01:25.811 --> 1:01:26.895
I'm scared.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:29.356
I can't do it.

1:01:29.940 --> 1:01:32.651
I can't do this anymore!

1:01:41.577 --> 1:01:44.121
The passengers are in an uproar.

1:01:44.913 --> 1:01:47.374
They want us to isolate the infected.

1:01:50.544 --> 1:01:54.256
Those with blisters on their skin,
go to the tail.

1:01:54.339 --> 1:01:56.383
Those who are still okay, to the front.

1:01:56.466 --> 1:01:58.969
The doctor is at the back!

1:01:59.052 --> 1:02:01.722
If you feel even a little sick,
have a fever,

1:02:01.805 --> 1:02:05.809
or have developed blisters,
please move to the back of the plane.

1:02:08.896 --> 1:02:12.274
Hold on. Is that a blister?

1:02:12.357 --> 1:02:14.735
What do you mean? It's eczema.

1:02:15.194 --> 1:02:17.988
- It looks like a blister.
- It's not that!

1:02:18.071 --> 1:02:21.074
Do you have a doctor's certificate?

1:02:21.158 --> 1:02:25.537
Why would I carry a doctor's certificate
for eczema?

1:02:26.121 --> 1:02:27.372
Come on, Soo-min.

1:02:35.464 --> 1:02:38.967
Dad, can we just go to the back?

1:02:41.136 --> 1:02:43.263
No. No way.

1:02:44.431 --> 1:02:47.726
Dad, let's just go. Okay?

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:54.024
No, this is just eczema.
You don't need to go there.

1:02:54.107 --> 1:02:56.318
- Mister--
- Let go of me!

1:02:57.861 --> 1:03:00.864
You can't just try to save yourselves!

1:03:02.491 --> 1:03:05.160
Aren't I right? Aren't I?

1:03:06.662 --> 1:03:10.082
Dad, let's just go.

1:03:11.208 --> 1:03:13.418
Please let's go!

1:03:17.589 --> 1:03:20.592
Are you okay?
Those with blisters, in the back.

1:03:21.802 --> 1:03:24.847
Sorry. It's because of me.

1:03:24.930 --> 1:03:26.723
You've nothing to be sorry about.

1:03:27.266 --> 1:03:28.267
It's okay.

1:03:32.646 --> 1:03:35.232
- Can you hand me that pillow?
- Yes.

1:03:35.315 --> 1:03:36.650
Hand me her medicine.

1:03:43.949 --> 1:03:46.869
An Emergency Response Team,
with the aviation policy director,

1:03:46.952 --> 1:03:50.914
Transport Minister Kim Sook-hee,
Health Minister Jeong Mi-ok,

1:03:50.998 --> 1:03:53.667
and Kim Myeong-sik of the Korea CDC

1:03:53.750 --> 1:03:57.254
are all departing for the US.

1:03:57.337 --> 1:04:00.841
They will address the situation
as soon as they land.

1:04:01.466 --> 1:04:06.221
Meanwhile, we are receiving more info
on Ryu Jin-seok.

1:04:06.305 --> 1:04:11.768
WAITING ROOM FOR FAMILIES
He was extremely quiet as a child.

1:04:11.852 --> 1:04:15.272
Neighbors describe him
as somewhat peculiar,

1:04:15.355 --> 1:04:19.860
with an incident over trash
resulting in conflict.

1:04:19.943 --> 1:04:22.112
Given all this,

1:04:22.196 --> 1:04:26.950
some are comparing him
to the Las Vegas shooter.

1:04:27.034 --> 1:04:30.954
First, he's an elite,
from a wealthy background.

1:04:31.038 --> 1:04:32.998
His apartment is expensive.

1:04:33.081 --> 1:04:36.710
So he's not expressing some kind of rage
towards society.

1:04:36.793 --> 1:04:41.256
Like the Place St. Lambert incident
in Belgium

1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:43.717
when a man attacked

1:04:43.800 --> 1:04:48.180
this sort of attack is unexplained,
with victims chosen at random.

1:04:48.263 --> 1:04:50.724
And the culprit also killed himself.

1:04:50.807 --> 1:04:53.018
It's known as "extended suicide."

1:04:53.101 --> 1:04:56.772
Now we have disasters
of this sort as well.

1:04:57.272 --> 1:05:00.025
Disasters are arbitrary.

1:05:00.108 --> 1:05:04.530
People became victims
for being in a certain place

1:05:04.613 --> 1:05:06.240
at a certain time.

1:05:07.032 --> 1:05:08.492
Just a minute, Captain.

1:05:13.622 --> 1:05:14.706
Excuse me.

1:05:15.958 --> 1:05:18.961
How about moving the second pilot
to the bunker?

1:05:19.044 --> 1:05:20.671
It seems dangerous here.

1:05:20.754 --> 1:05:24.299
But I think it's more dangerous there.

1:05:24.383 --> 1:05:28.804
The terrorist's body
and the passengers who died are there.

1:05:37.229 --> 1:05:39.940
- How many PO2s do you have?
- What?

1:05:40.858 --> 1:05:44.653
Oxygen cylinders for the cabin.
Not the overhead masks.

1:05:44.736 --> 1:05:48.156
I guess about 20 of them.

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:53.829
How about using them on passengers
with trouble breathing?

1:06:02.045 --> 1:06:03.422
Here's a fever reducer.

1:06:03.797 --> 1:06:07.676
You need to hold on until we land.

1:06:23.317 --> 1:06:25.777
Look at all those reporters.

1:06:26.612 --> 1:06:29.323
Those BRICOM assholes.
There's no time for this.

1:06:32.367 --> 1:06:37.247
There's no warrant yet.
Not enough evidence, it seems.

1:06:38.332 --> 1:06:40.792
We don't have time for this now!

1:06:40.876 --> 1:06:42.586
You're obstructing an investigation!

1:06:42.669 --> 1:06:45.589
Just cooperate, okay? Step aside.

1:06:46.757 --> 1:06:50.302
We've nothing to do with this case!

1:06:50.385 --> 1:06:52.262
If you want to come in, get a warrant!

1:06:52.346 --> 1:06:54.556
We got the warrant, right?

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:55.807
We got it already.

1:06:55.891 --> 1:06:57.100
Don't lie to me.

1:06:57.184 --> 1:07:01.313
Follow the procedures,
show some connection to the case,

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:02.481
and then come back!

1:07:02.564 --> 1:07:04.900
You asshole!

1:07:11.532 --> 1:07:13.450
Try to pierce through!

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:21.583
Sir, this...

1:07:33.011 --> 1:07:33.971
Hello?

1:08:10.215 --> 1:08:13.218
We've tried contacting senators,
the White House,

1:08:13.302 --> 1:08:14.469
but it's no use.

1:08:24.271 --> 1:08:25.230
I'm sure you know,

1:08:25.314 --> 1:08:28.984
the longer they stay in that plane,
the more dangerous it is.

1:08:29.067 --> 1:08:30.819
They absolutely refuse.

1:08:31.737 --> 1:08:36.450
They said they can't take that risk
without knowing anything.

1:08:37.075 --> 1:08:40.787
If we wait longer,
the plane may not have fuel to get back.

1:08:42.039 --> 1:08:43.332
On their way back,

1:08:43.790 --> 1:08:48.462
we'll try somehow to let them land
in another country.

1:08:48.837 --> 1:08:50.172
Yes, sir.

1:08:52.341 --> 1:08:53.467
We're turning back.

1:08:55.135 --> 1:08:56.345
Give the order.

1:08:57.846 --> 1:09:02.100
Sky Korea 501, we'd like you to turn back.

1:09:04.269 --> 1:09:05.479
Did you hear me?

1:09:06.355 --> 1:09:08.398
Please return to Incheon.

1:09:10.776 --> 1:09:12.402
First Officer Choi?

1:09:13.737 --> 1:09:15.155
I hear you.

1:09:21.203 --> 1:09:23.121
KI501 is turning back.

1:09:23.205 --> 1:09:26.291
- Check fuel levels!
- KI501 is turning back!

1:09:52.401 --> 1:09:53.902
Flight KI501,

1:09:53.986 --> 1:09:57.656
after suffering
an unprecedented terror attack,

1:09:57.739 --> 1:10:00.993
is reportedly turning back to Korea.

1:10:01.076 --> 1:10:04.037
Passengers had been about to land
for treatment,

1:10:04.538 --> 1:10:06.957
but it's unclear what happened...

1:10:14.715 --> 1:10:16.133
Just a minute.

1:10:16.216 --> 1:10:18.844
Are we turning back?

1:10:19.511 --> 1:10:21.180
We saw the news.

1:10:22.264 --> 1:10:23.182
I'm sorry.

1:10:23.265 --> 1:10:25.809
This is insane. Turn back?

1:10:25.893 --> 1:10:28.145
How can we wait that long?

1:10:28.228 --> 1:10:33.317
Damn, I can't do it!
I can't wait any longer!

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:38.488
Land in Hawaii now! Right now!

1:10:38.572 --> 1:10:40.657
The US won't let us in.

1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:44.953
They refused to let us land,
so we're turning back.

1:10:48.707 --> 1:10:51.668
We'll all die this way.

1:10:58.091 --> 1:11:02.012
KI501 TURNS BACK

1:11:05.807 --> 1:11:07.392
Hello? Honey!

1:11:08.727 --> 1:11:10.771
- Honey!
- Honey?

1:11:10.854 --> 1:11:12.564
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

1:11:12.648 --> 1:11:15.484
How are you? Are you okay?

1:11:16.360 --> 1:11:17.611
How is Min-jung?

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:21.406
She's fine. Is your health okay?

1:11:21.490 --> 1:11:23.325
You're not hurt?

1:11:23.408 --> 1:11:28.956
I'm okay. But it's total chaos here.

1:11:29.206 --> 1:11:30.541
I'm scared.

1:11:30.624 --> 1:11:34.211
Just hold out a bit longer.
We're working on a solution.

1:11:34.294 --> 1:11:37.422
You are, right? You can fix things?

1:11:37.506 --> 1:11:38.715
Don't worry.

1:11:38.799 --> 1:11:41.009
Hello? Honey?

1:11:42.970 --> 1:11:44.054
Hello?

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:45.722
Hello?

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:16.503
The plane's turning back?
The US didn't let them land?

1:12:17.129 --> 1:12:18.463
That's the current situation.

1:12:18.547 --> 1:12:20.090
What's the situation in the plane?

1:12:20.757 --> 1:12:23.635
Luckily, there's a doctor onboard,

1:12:24.636 --> 1:12:28.098
and the flight crew are doing their best.

1:12:53.207 --> 1:12:54.917
What's your plan for when it lands?

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:59.296
The quarantine system will be formed
shortly.

1:13:00.589 --> 1:13:02.966
- Just a minute!
- Please tell us something!

1:13:08.138 --> 1:13:09.723
I'm so angry.

1:13:10.182 --> 1:13:12.351
We've become his guinea pigs.

1:13:29.117 --> 1:13:31.578
- Sergeant!
- Did we get the warrant?

1:13:31.662 --> 1:13:33.372
No, but

1:13:33.705 --> 1:13:36.625
someone who saw you on TV is on the phone.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:38.335
She wants to talk to you.

1:13:38.794 --> 1:13:40.879
She's a BRICOM employee.

1:13:43.173 --> 1:13:44.216
Hello?

1:13:44.299 --> 1:13:45.884
- I...
- Yes?

1:13:45.968 --> 1:13:47.511
This can't be traced, right?

1:13:47.594 --> 1:13:50.514
Not at all! I'm speaking outside.

1:13:50.973 --> 1:13:51.932
Or recorded?

1:13:52.015 --> 1:13:56.103
No, this is an iPhone,
so it can't record calls.

1:13:56.186 --> 1:13:58.647
- Don't worry.
- You've no connection to BRICOM?

1:13:58.730 --> 1:14:03.402
No, you saw me fighting them on TV.

1:14:03.777 --> 1:14:05.112
Yes, please go ahead.

1:14:05.195 --> 1:14:08.198
Things are in an uproar here.
So I have to be careful.

1:14:08.282 --> 1:14:12.494
I understand.
This is a sensitive situation, I know.

1:14:12.828 --> 1:14:18.208
It seems like
someone here conspired with Ryu Jin-seok.

1:14:18.542 --> 1:14:23.630
As soon as he saw the news,
he rushed home, as if fleeing.

1:14:25.966 --> 1:14:27.259
Ma'am!

1:14:27.342 --> 1:14:30.429
This way please, it's not safe here.

1:14:34.016 --> 1:14:34.933
Who is it?

1:14:35.017 --> 1:14:36.643
I've got a delivery.

1:14:37.144 --> 1:14:38.187
Just a minute.

1:14:38.270 --> 1:14:41.190
Shouldn't we pick the lock?

1:14:42.191 --> 1:14:44.693
Sergeant, he jumped out the window!

1:14:44.776 --> 1:14:45.819
Damn it!

1:14:46.862 --> 1:14:48.822
Hey, second floor!

1:14:48.906 --> 1:14:50.490
Grab him, quick!

1:14:51.867 --> 1:14:53.118
Stop right there!

1:14:53.410 --> 1:14:55.162
That way!

1:14:55.787 --> 1:14:57.664
Climb over!

1:14:57.748 --> 1:14:59.750
Climb over it!

1:15:00.042 --> 1:15:02.127
Can't you get over this?

1:15:05.881 --> 1:15:07.925
Shit, twisted my leg...

1:15:09.593 --> 1:15:11.553
My scooter!

1:15:18.894 --> 1:15:20.354
Stop, you asshole!

1:15:21.063 --> 1:15:22.856
Grab him, hurry!

1:15:22.940 --> 1:15:23.941
Catch him!

1:15:24.191 --> 1:15:26.693
Why are you running? Get in the car.

1:15:26.777 --> 1:15:29.238
- You coward!
- Why call me that?

1:15:29.530 --> 1:15:30.739
Chase him!

1:15:31.448 --> 1:15:33.951
- Go faster!
- Up front!

1:15:34.034 --> 1:15:35.202
Out of the way!

1:15:35.661 --> 1:15:36.620
Turn left.

1:15:36.703 --> 1:15:37.871
Left!

1:15:40.207 --> 1:15:43.210
- Go faster!
- I am going fast.

1:15:44.127 --> 1:15:45.170
My goodness.

1:15:45.963 --> 1:15:48.549
Right, turn right!

1:15:48.632 --> 1:15:49.591
Right.

1:15:49.675 --> 1:15:52.261
Come on. A little faster.

1:15:52.344 --> 1:15:53.887
- Step on it!
- I'm trying!

1:15:53.971 --> 1:15:55.597
Hey, that's too fast!

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:56.849
On his tail!

1:15:56.932 --> 1:15:57.975
Too fast!

1:15:58.058 --> 1:15:59.434
What am I supposed to do?

1:15:59.518 --> 1:16:00.644
Watch out!

1:16:24.543 --> 1:16:25.711
Oh Sung-hoon.

1:16:26.170 --> 1:16:27.504
You're Oh Sung-hoon, right?

1:16:27.588 --> 1:16:31.216
What? It's not like that.
Why are you chasing me?

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:32.551
You punk.

1:16:32.634 --> 1:16:34.970
You're arrested as an accomplice
in the terror attack.

1:16:35.053 --> 1:16:36.138
Come here!

1:16:36.763 --> 1:16:38.515
Are you okay?

1:16:38.599 --> 1:16:40.184
Shit.

1:16:40.809 --> 1:16:41.768
You jerk.

1:16:41.852 --> 1:16:45.063
Mister, don't talk. You're bleeding a lot.

1:16:45.147 --> 1:16:46.899
We need an ambulance here!

1:16:46.982 --> 1:16:48.859
Somebody!

1:16:52.321 --> 1:16:55.449
- Damn it!
- You say you're not an accomplice.

1:16:55.532 --> 1:16:57.326
Then why'd you run?

1:16:58.744 --> 1:17:00.204
I was scared.

1:17:03.582 --> 1:17:05.918
He tricked me too, that bastard!

1:17:08.587 --> 1:17:11.590
He kept saying
he was unfairly fired from BRICOM.

1:17:11.673 --> 1:17:14.676
I thought he deserved pity.

1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:16.386
What are you saying?

1:17:16.470 --> 1:17:17.846
What happened was...

1:17:18.555 --> 1:17:22.684
A few years ago, we received
a mutated virus from the Middle East.

1:17:22.768 --> 1:17:27.814
Called SC-1, highly infectious,
hemorrhagic and very dangerous.

1:17:27.898 --> 1:17:33.320
But three of our researchers got exposed
to the virus.

1:17:33.403 --> 1:17:35.531
The person in charge was...

1:17:37.950 --> 1:17:39.284
Ryu Jin-seok.

1:17:39.368 --> 1:17:40.661
The only person

1:17:41.787 --> 1:17:43.872
who survived

1:17:43.956 --> 1:17:49.753
told the police
that Ryu intentionally exposed them.

1:17:49.837 --> 1:17:52.089
Ryu said he was unfairly accused.

1:17:52.172 --> 1:17:55.300
There was no evidence,
but the survivor was adamant.

1:17:55.384 --> 1:17:58.011
The company had brought the virus
in secretly,

1:17:58.470 --> 1:18:01.014
so they insisted it was an accident,

1:18:01.098 --> 1:18:05.978
and Ryu was fired
without any charges filed with the police.

1:18:06.061 --> 1:18:08.730
But that bastard Ryu
with his innocent face

1:18:08.814 --> 1:18:11.191
begged me to send him a sample,

1:18:11.275 --> 1:18:16.113
saying he wanted to clear his name
and get rehired...

1:18:16.905 --> 1:18:18.365
There's a survivor?

1:18:18.448 --> 1:18:20.909
Where's the person who survived?

1:18:22.661 --> 1:18:24.746
The corpse from Ryu's house.

1:18:24.830 --> 1:18:28.458
They said they'd incubate the virus
from the body, was it done?

1:18:28.542 --> 1:18:32.045
Can they determine
what kind of virus it is?

1:18:32.713 --> 1:18:36.133
Yes, it only takes two hours,
so they must have a result.

1:18:39.970 --> 1:18:41.889
Sky Korea 501!

1:18:42.431 --> 1:18:44.099
Sky Korea 501!

1:18:44.766 --> 1:18:46.810
Your velocity is Mach 0.85.

1:18:46.894 --> 1:18:47.978
Is this correct?

1:18:49.021 --> 1:18:50.272
Yes.

1:18:50.355 --> 1:18:52.024
Why are you flying so fast?

1:18:52.107 --> 1:18:53.567
Is something wrong?

1:18:54.985 --> 1:18:58.906
Have you secured any landing spot
on the return route?

1:18:58.989 --> 1:19:01.366
We're negotiating. Is something wrong?

1:19:01.700 --> 1:19:05.579
I don't feel so well.

1:19:13.545 --> 1:19:14.963
When did that appear?

1:19:18.008 --> 1:19:19.218
Indeed.

1:19:20.385 --> 1:19:22.304
Take a shot of the fever reducer.

1:19:22.721 --> 1:19:26.391
No, there aren't enough.

1:19:26.475 --> 1:19:28.352
You're the chief flight attendant.

1:19:28.435 --> 1:19:31.855
Everyone's looking to you,
attendants and passengers.

1:19:35.108 --> 1:19:37.861
I was planning to quit after this year.

1:19:38.946 --> 1:19:43.075
Get my sister married, and then quit.

1:19:43.408 --> 1:19:45.285
She should get herself married.

1:19:45.369 --> 1:19:46.995
Why rely on you?

1:19:49.331 --> 1:19:50.332
You're right.

1:19:52.167 --> 1:19:55.379
- I'll quit when we land.
- Yes, quit right away.

1:19:58.340 --> 1:20:00.050
You were a pilot?

1:20:03.887 --> 1:20:05.138
A long time ago.

1:20:05.222 --> 1:20:06.932
Why did you quit?

1:20:08.892 --> 1:20:09.852
Sir!

1:20:09.935 --> 1:20:11.270
One of the passengers is a pilot.

1:20:11.353 --> 1:20:14.815
Captain Park Jae-hyuk.
Alpha grade, lots of experience.

1:20:16.191 --> 1:20:17.276
But...

1:20:19.361 --> 1:20:22.489
The weather was terrible that day, too.

1:20:25.826 --> 1:20:26.952
First Officer Choi.

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:30.539
One of the passengers is a pilot.

1:20:31.206 --> 1:20:32.791
Did you know that?

1:20:35.419 --> 1:20:39.506
Not long before landing,
one of the engines caught fire.

1:20:39.590 --> 1:20:41.550
I wanted to make an emergency landing,

1:20:41.633 --> 1:20:44.386
but the control tower in Norway disagreed.

1:20:45.554 --> 1:20:48.807
They said the wind was too strong,

1:20:49.850 --> 1:20:52.436
to turn back and land elsewhere.

1:20:52.519 --> 1:20:56.815
But with the engine trouble,

1:20:56.899 --> 1:21:00.652
I thought it safer to risk the wind.

1:21:00.736 --> 1:21:02.154
I heard about that.

1:21:02.237 --> 1:21:06.283
The airplane burned,
but the passengers were all saved.

1:21:06.366 --> 1:21:09.995
Two flight attendants in the tail,

1:21:10.078 --> 1:21:13.832
helping passengers disembark

1:21:15.542 --> 1:21:17.211
died when it caught fire.

1:21:17.294 --> 1:21:22.090
Because passengers getting their luggage
blocked the exit...

1:21:22.174 --> 1:21:24.134
One of the flight attendants...

1:21:29.264 --> 1:21:31.391
was First Officer Choi's wife.

1:21:39.441 --> 1:21:40.776
Maybe

1:21:40.859 --> 1:21:45.864
I should've listened to the tower
instead of insisting.

1:21:47.449 --> 1:21:49.576
Thousands of times I've questioned myself.

1:21:54.414 --> 1:21:55.791
Ever since then...

1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:01.213
I just can't do it.

1:22:01.672 --> 1:22:05.926
When I board a plane,
I can't even breathe...

1:22:13.892 --> 1:22:15.352
Chief attendant speaking.

1:22:16.395 --> 1:22:19.690
Remember that there's a pilot
among the passengers?

1:22:20.607 --> 1:22:22.025
Park Jae-hyuk.

1:22:22.901 --> 1:22:23.944
Yes.

1:22:24.027 --> 1:22:26.738
We should get him prepared just in case.

1:22:28.323 --> 1:22:29.658
First Officer Choi!

1:22:30.951 --> 1:22:32.202
First Officer Choi!

1:22:37.624 --> 1:22:41.170
Ryu's mother
had been a famous microbiologist.

1:22:42.045 --> 1:22:46.258
I don't remember her name.
She used to pressure Ryu,

1:22:46.884 --> 1:22:52.264
and when he felt stressed,
he'd get pleasure in killing animals.

1:22:53.724 --> 1:22:57.519
Of course we told the company
and they made him stop, but...

1:22:58.437 --> 1:23:03.942
I think he did it to get revenge.

1:23:04.902 --> 1:23:09.781
I saw it with my own eyes.

1:23:10.490 --> 1:23:13.285
We were dying in the lab,

1:23:13.869 --> 1:23:18.332
and his eyes...

1:23:18.415 --> 1:23:19.958
They were laughing.

1:23:22.211 --> 1:23:27.382
His colleagues were writhing in agony,

1:23:27.925 --> 1:23:30.177
and he was smiling.

1:23:32.930 --> 1:23:38.101
I brought a sample of the virus
from the corpse in Ryu's house.

1:23:38.727 --> 1:23:41.730
Would you be able to recognize it?

1:23:52.449 --> 1:23:56.537
How could I ever forget this?

1:24:16.932 --> 1:24:18.892
They found an antivirus.

1:24:21.478 --> 1:24:22.813
Are you sure?

1:24:22.896 --> 1:24:27.568
Yes, Ryu took the virus from BRICOM
and used it in the attack.

1:24:28.151 --> 1:24:32.614
The virus from the dead body,
and the virus studied at BRICOM

1:24:32.698 --> 1:24:33.866
are the same.

1:24:35.033 --> 1:24:37.661
How many forces can we deploy
to the BRICOM?

1:24:41.582 --> 1:24:43.125
Are you okay, First Officer?

1:24:47.421 --> 1:24:48.881
Can you do it?

1:24:53.135 --> 1:24:56.638
You flew a 777 before,
so it won't be much different.

1:24:56.930 --> 1:24:59.391
Technical support staff are standing by.

1:25:00.017 --> 1:25:01.476
So even if something happens,

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:03.437
it won't be too hard.

1:25:26.126 --> 1:25:28.212
Are you crazy? You're going to kill us!

1:25:32.049 --> 1:25:34.134
Open up. There's no time.

1:25:34.218 --> 1:25:35.344
Open up!

1:25:37.179 --> 1:25:39.306
You bastards!

1:25:44.728 --> 1:25:46.021
Out of the way!

1:25:51.193 --> 1:25:53.111
No, it isn't!

1:25:53.195 --> 1:25:54.780
What's with you girls?

1:25:54.863 --> 1:25:59.034
Hey, what if you infect
all the people here? Huh?

1:25:59.117 --> 1:26:01.828
- Get out, now!
- No, it's not true!

1:26:01.912 --> 1:26:03.664
Will you stop it?

1:26:05.832 --> 1:26:09.211
- Stop what?
- These girls could be your daughters.

1:26:09.294 --> 1:26:13.006
We can't all just try to save
ourselves here!

1:26:13.298 --> 1:26:16.218
Look at this.
Look, I saw that on you before.

1:26:16.301 --> 1:26:19.638
It's a blister, right?

1:26:19.972 --> 1:26:22.724
- You go, too! All of you!
- Stop it!

1:26:22.808 --> 1:26:25.519
- Get out!
- I said stop it!

1:26:26.270 --> 1:26:29.106
My god, don't you have kids?

1:26:32.568 --> 1:26:34.987
It's okay, girls. Come with me.

1:26:35.070 --> 1:26:39.199
There's a doctor there, it'll be okay.

1:26:39.658 --> 1:26:40.868
It's okay.

1:26:43.579 --> 1:26:45.080
Look at you.

1:26:45.706 --> 1:26:48.792
If you go out,
you can't come back, you know?

1:26:49.459 --> 1:26:51.712
In this tiny plane,

1:26:51.795 --> 1:26:56.133
it seems a bit much
to be kicking people out.

1:26:57.634 --> 1:27:01.972
We're just trying to survive!
You'll die if you leave here.

1:27:02.055 --> 1:27:06.602
Look at how few are left.
You chased everyone out.

1:27:06.685 --> 1:27:09.104
Just survive on your own, okay?

1:27:16.653 --> 1:27:20.532
Let's do this, people! Be strong!

1:27:20.949 --> 1:27:21.992
Soo-min!

1:27:22.826 --> 1:27:24.077
I came right back, right?

1:27:25.913 --> 1:27:27.164
Would you like this?

1:27:30.209 --> 1:27:32.377
Is Dad flying the plane?

1:27:33.837 --> 1:27:34.880
Yeah.

1:27:35.631 --> 1:27:37.841
He's scared of planes.

1:27:51.522 --> 1:27:55.817
Have you flown even once since then?

1:27:59.947 --> 1:28:04.159
I'm sure I can do it.
I used to do it all the time.

1:28:05.118 --> 1:28:08.247
- You were going on vacation?
- Not vacation.

1:28:08.622 --> 1:28:10.624
My kid has eczema.

1:28:11.542 --> 1:28:14.461
Other kids made fun of her for it.

1:28:16.129 --> 1:28:17.464
She was having a hard time.

1:28:17.881 --> 1:28:20.801
She's gotten quiet
since my wife and I divorced.

1:28:21.718 --> 1:28:23.846
They say clean air can cure eczema.

1:28:23.929 --> 1:28:29.142
My friend has
a light aircraft business there.

1:28:30.519 --> 1:28:33.188
He said they need an instructor.

1:28:33.856 --> 1:28:35.190
Teaching theory.

1:28:53.584 --> 1:28:55.252
Open the door, now!

1:28:55.335 --> 1:28:58.839
Show us the customs clearance for SC-1!

1:28:58.922 --> 1:29:01.633
You have an antivirus and vaccine!

1:29:03.093 --> 1:29:05.053
Bring the warrant!

1:29:06.221 --> 1:29:07.639
Show us evidence!

1:29:08.473 --> 1:29:10.058
You know this is illegal?

1:29:17.065 --> 1:29:19.526
Before we bring the warrant,

1:29:19.735 --> 1:29:22.237
you'd be smart to listen to him.

1:29:23.488 --> 1:29:27.451
Give us the vaccine and antivirus,
and mitigate your crime!

1:29:28.076 --> 1:29:31.872
If this gets out,
it won't end with you going bankrupt.

1:29:35.209 --> 1:29:36.585
Do you have proof?

1:29:56.730 --> 1:30:02.402
The virus released in the attack
was taken by Ryu Jin-seok from a lab

1:30:02.486 --> 1:30:04.530
at his former employer BRICOM.

1:30:04.613 --> 1:30:10.035
Fortunately, BRICOM possesses
an antiviral treatment and vaccine

1:30:10.118 --> 1:30:13.288
which they will provide to victims
free of charge.

1:30:17.209 --> 1:30:21.046
They found a treatment!
It was just announced!

1:30:22.256 --> 1:30:23.882
They found a treatment!

1:30:24.550 --> 1:30:28.679
The calls are coming in.
It was on the news.

1:30:39.106 --> 1:30:41.358
They found a treatment! A treatment!

1:30:41.817 --> 1:30:42.943
They found a treatment!

1:30:43.026 --> 1:30:45.195
- We're going to live!
- Is it true?

1:30:57.457 --> 1:30:59.835
- Is it certain?
- Yes, it is.

1:30:59.918 --> 1:31:01.670
They found a treatment.

1:31:02.212 --> 1:31:03.547
They found a treatment.

1:31:03.630 --> 1:31:04.840
Really?

1:31:06.717 --> 1:31:08.010
That's great.

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:12.181
What a relief. I knew they would.

1:31:13.724 --> 1:31:15.100
Hello?

1:31:15.809 --> 1:31:16.935
Honey!

1:31:17.019 --> 1:31:18.812
How did you find it?

1:31:19.855 --> 1:31:21.732
How do you think?

1:31:22.191 --> 1:31:24.526
That's what detectives do.

1:31:25.527 --> 1:31:27.571
Now you just need to get home.

1:31:27.654 --> 1:31:30.949
It's for the best.
Korea's much better than Hawaii.

1:31:33.076 --> 1:31:35.579
Just hold on a bit longer.

1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:40.751
Okay, I will.

1:31:49.968 --> 1:31:52.679
- It's all thanks to you.
- Minister!

1:31:52.971 --> 1:31:54.473
You made a great effort.

1:31:54.681 --> 1:31:55.807
It was nothing.

1:31:56.558 --> 1:32:00.312
I'm a public servant. Just doing my job.

1:32:02.022 --> 1:32:05.567
Actually, my wife is on that plane.

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:08.111
I heard.

1:32:09.404 --> 1:32:11.323
Please help, Minister.

1:32:13.450 --> 1:32:16.495
Bring her back safely.

1:32:17.412 --> 1:32:19.122
All the way home.

1:32:21.708 --> 1:32:22.709
I will.

1:32:28.674 --> 1:32:31.885
Japan should accept us now, right?

1:32:36.431 --> 1:32:37.599
First Officer!

1:32:46.275 --> 1:32:48.235
We'll have to land at Narita.

1:32:49.862 --> 1:32:51.572
The weather was bad at takeoff,

1:32:52.030 --> 1:32:56.535
so we added some extra fuel,

1:32:56.785 --> 1:33:00.747
but I doubt there's enough to reach Seoul.

1:33:01.415 --> 1:33:03.166
And speaking honestly,

1:33:05.377 --> 1:33:08.839
neither one of us is in condition to fly.

1:33:17.556 --> 1:33:18.724
Kubo-san!

1:33:18.974 --> 1:33:22.686
KI501 seems to be turning towards us.

1:33:22.769 --> 1:33:24.146
What did you say?

1:33:24.229 --> 1:33:26.565
It's the plane
that was hit with the bioterror attack.

1:33:26.648 --> 1:33:29.651
Sky Korea 501!

1:33:29.735 --> 1:33:31.904
Are you turning towards Japan?

1:33:31.987 --> 1:33:33.030
Yes.

1:33:34.031 --> 1:33:36.074
We're going to land at Narita.

1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:38.327
We need to discuss this with Japan.

1:33:42.414 --> 1:33:43.582
I'm sorry.

1:33:44.958 --> 1:33:47.127
I can't hold out any longer.

1:33:48.086 --> 1:33:50.380
I'm issuing an emergency declaration.

1:33:53.967 --> 1:33:56.887
KI501 issued an emergency declaration.

1:33:57.930 --> 1:33:59.223
Isn't Park Jae-hyuk there?

1:33:59.306 --> 1:34:02.142
It seems he's not in a state to fly.

1:34:05.896 --> 1:34:07.272
Japan?

1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:10.943
Ladies and gentlemen,
to ensure your safety,

1:34:11.026 --> 1:34:14.154
we will land at Narita Airport.

1:34:14.238 --> 1:34:15.989
Come on, let's go to the back!

1:34:16.073 --> 1:34:18.784
During landing, the back is the safest!

1:34:33.757 --> 1:34:35.008
They're going to Japan?

1:34:35.425 --> 1:34:38.595
The pilot's condition is bad.
It seems he was infected.

1:34:38.679 --> 1:34:41.306
There's a former pilot
among the passengers,

1:34:42.099 --> 1:34:45.018
but it seems he's not in a state to fly.

1:34:45.102 --> 1:34:46.478
What's their response?

1:34:46.562 --> 1:34:48.021
No answer yet.

1:34:48.105 --> 1:34:49.898
We told them
there's an antiviral and vaccine,

1:34:49.982 --> 1:34:51.108
and the pilot is sick.

1:34:51.191 --> 1:34:52.693
I'll call the Foreign Ministry.

1:34:53.402 --> 1:34:54.528
But...

1:34:56.530 --> 1:34:59.658
It'll be okay.
We have a vaccine, after all.

1:35:00.075 --> 1:35:01.660
Don't worry, Sarge.

1:35:21.847 --> 1:35:22.890
Why not?

1:35:23.432 --> 1:35:25.184
We've got a treatment.

1:35:27.561 --> 1:35:28.896
Tokyo refused.

1:35:30.981 --> 1:35:33.358
They're ordering them to leave
Japanese airspace.

1:35:39.364 --> 1:35:40.866
Try telling them again.

1:35:41.241 --> 1:35:43.452
Our team will leave now
with the treatment.

1:35:44.369 --> 1:35:48.248
Try again.
Tell them we absolutely need to land.

1:35:53.587 --> 1:35:56.006
She said try again, asshole!

1:35:57.382 --> 1:35:58.425
Sarge!

1:35:59.051 --> 1:36:00.552
What are you doing?

1:36:01.887 --> 1:36:04.264
This isn't so simple an issue.

1:36:04.348 --> 1:36:06.850
Our President has already tried calling.

1:36:18.820 --> 1:36:20.405
I can't last any longer.

1:36:29.498 --> 1:36:31.124
The plane is going to Narita.

1:36:31.792 --> 1:36:35.420
Five minutes to arrival.
Order other planes to turn back.

1:36:53.897 --> 1:36:56.316
An unidentified object is approaching!

1:37:21.216 --> 1:37:22.301
Where did they go?

1:37:27.472 --> 1:37:29.892
It's appeared in front of them!

1:37:54.291 --> 1:37:55.584
Hey, Hyun-soo.

1:38:08.472 --> 1:38:10.015
They're still heading to Narita!

1:38:26.865 --> 1:38:28.408
They've fired warning shots.

1:39:02.276 --> 1:39:04.361
They're approaching closer.

1:39:10.450 --> 1:39:13.120
Permission to fire denied.

1:39:36.185 --> 1:39:38.896
Ladies and gentlemen, we will land soon.

1:39:38.979 --> 1:39:41.064
Due to shaking of the aircraft,

1:39:41.148 --> 1:39:43.317
please adopt the position
for crash landing.

1:39:52.367 --> 1:39:53.410
First Officer Choi!

1:39:54.912 --> 1:39:56.205
The air force has appeared again!

1:39:56.288 --> 1:39:58.832
They're approaching head on!

1:40:03.629 --> 1:40:06.215
No, it's too dangerous!

1:40:46.547 --> 1:40:48.507
First Officer Choi! Hyun-soo!

1:40:49.258 --> 1:40:50.217
Hyun-soo!

1:41:16.368 --> 1:41:20.914
A moment ago, the Korean airliner KI501

1:41:20.998 --> 1:41:22.791
trespassed into Japanese airspace,

1:41:22.875 --> 1:41:25.836
and the Air Self-Defense Force
was mobilized.

1:41:26.587 --> 1:41:29.756
- Ignoring its given route,
- Hyun-soo! Please bring the doctor.

1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:31.341
Hyun-soo.

1:41:31.425 --> 1:41:33.427
KI501 attempted to land at Narita Airport.

1:41:34.136 --> 1:41:38.265
It has now given up trying to land
and is headed towards Korea.

1:41:38.724 --> 1:41:44.730
The Korean government asked us to grant
landing permission,

1:41:44.813 --> 1:41:48.025
as it has antivirals and vaccines
in its possession.

1:41:48.775 --> 1:41:54.781
However, Japan's Ministry of Health
believes that this virus

1:41:55.324 --> 1:42:00.454
has a much shorter incubation period
than the original virus,

1:42:00.537 --> 1:42:04.374
and so it is highly likely

1:42:04.458 --> 1:42:08.962
that this virus is a mutation.

1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:15.636
A government's first duty is
to protect its citizens,

1:42:15.719 --> 1:42:19.264
so we had no choice but to avoid exposing
our nation to danger.

1:42:19.348 --> 1:42:20.349
What's he saying?

1:42:20.432 --> 1:42:22.017
They said it would surely work!

1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:26.647
The Japanese government expresses
its deepest regret

1:42:26.730 --> 1:42:29.107
to the Korean people,

1:42:29.191 --> 1:42:33.570
and hopes for KI501's safe passage

1:42:33.654 --> 1:42:35.405
to Korea.

1:42:35.489 --> 1:42:37.324
I guess there's no cure.

1:42:37.616 --> 1:42:41.119
They'll need
at least a few months to test it.

1:42:41.203 --> 1:42:44.540
There's no cure?

1:42:46.166 --> 1:42:48.919
They said they found a treatment.

1:42:50.629 --> 1:42:53.257
They said we could live.

1:42:54.424 --> 1:42:55.551
Please don't move.

1:42:55.634 --> 1:42:59.555
We were concerned too,
but what they said can't be denied.

1:43:00.055 --> 1:43:04.852
A shorter incubation period means
the virus may have mutated.

1:43:05.477 --> 1:43:10.607
So the antiviral may be effective,
or may not.

1:43:10.858 --> 1:43:13.944
It's not 100% certain.

1:43:20.492 --> 1:43:21.577
Min-jung.

1:43:21.910 --> 1:43:25.414
Dad, is it true what they said?

1:43:25.497 --> 1:43:29.168
Is it really not a cure?

1:43:29.251 --> 1:43:33.255
Public opinion is worsening
after Japan's refusal.

1:43:33.338 --> 1:43:35.215
Are we still planning on Seoul Air Base?

1:43:35.883 --> 1:43:37.509
What do you mean?

1:43:37.968 --> 1:43:40.345
We prepared negative pressure
isolation rooms for treatment.

1:43:40.429 --> 1:43:43.140
Given public opinion, and the situation...

1:43:43.765 --> 1:43:46.101
Forty people have died already,

1:43:46.518 --> 1:43:49.354
and we can assume
the survivors are all infected.

1:43:49.438 --> 1:43:52.608
If they land quickly,
we'll collect their permission

1:43:52.691 --> 1:43:54.693
and start testing on the infected at once.

1:43:54.776 --> 1:43:57.237
It doesn't work?

1:43:57.321 --> 1:43:59.114
If it's so deadly,

1:43:59.948 --> 1:44:01.909
and after it lands,

1:44:01.992 --> 1:44:07.372
the treatment doesn't work
and even one more person gets infected,

1:44:07.456 --> 1:44:10.250
who will take responsibility then?

1:44:10.334 --> 1:44:13.712
That's why the US and Japan refused them.

1:44:13.795 --> 1:44:15.714
We need to accept them.

1:44:15.797 --> 1:44:18.217
People on the ground are our people, too.

1:44:18.926 --> 1:44:22.721
We need to think of the danger
that comes as soon as the plane lands.

1:44:22.804 --> 1:44:24.056
Right now,

1:44:25.390 --> 1:44:28.393
we need to think of minimizing the damage.

1:44:29.561 --> 1:44:31.396
Are you saying we should shoot it down,

1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:34.691
or just let it run out of fuel?

1:44:34.775 --> 1:44:38.195
Has anyone here said such a thing?

1:44:38.278 --> 1:44:40.155
If we don't decide now,

1:44:41.865 --> 1:44:43.242
that's what will happen.

1:44:43.951 --> 1:44:45.077
Dad.

1:44:46.036 --> 1:44:47.079
Dad!

1:44:47.412 --> 1:44:49.289
The treatment doesn't work?

1:44:52.251 --> 1:44:53.168
Sergeant.

1:44:53.502 --> 1:44:54.419
Sergeant!

1:44:54.753 --> 1:44:59.591
The President is considering what to do,
so let's wait.

1:45:01.468 --> 1:45:03.178
What's going on?

1:45:03.887 --> 1:45:07.432
If there's a treatment,
why did Japan send the air force?

1:45:07.516 --> 1:45:08.809
Things are not good.

1:45:09.643 --> 1:45:11.687
We're not sure about the treatment.

1:45:14.565 --> 1:45:17.192
The weather is not good.

1:45:17.276 --> 1:45:21.280
If the motor overheats,
the autopilot may not operate.

1:45:23.782 --> 1:45:25.409
I should go to Seoul Air Base?

1:45:27.578 --> 1:45:29.830
Can you hear me? Seoul?

1:45:45.554 --> 1:45:46.555
Sergeant.

1:45:47.931 --> 1:45:49.016
Sergeant!

1:45:51.643 --> 1:45:53.770
What are you doing?

1:45:54.104 --> 1:45:57.566
Listen closely. You see the virus there?

1:45:57.900 --> 1:46:01.528
I'll inject myself with it,
since I'll never get permission.

1:46:01.612 --> 1:46:04.489
Once I do, call Minister Kim.

1:46:04.573 --> 1:46:08.660
Tell her to give me the antivirus,
and if I live, let the plane land.

1:46:08.744 --> 1:46:12.956
I know what you mean,
but Sarge, please don't do this.

1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:14.958
You know how scary that is.

1:46:15.042 --> 1:46:19.630
You saw what that survivor in the hospital
looked like.

1:46:20.005 --> 1:46:21.256
There's no time, and no other way.

1:46:21.340 --> 1:46:23.425
If we dilly-dally,
those people will all die.

1:46:23.509 --> 1:46:28.180
We can't stand by.
We have to do all we can.

1:46:28.263 --> 1:46:32.518
I won't let my wife die this way, okay?

1:46:37.189 --> 1:46:38.273
Stay still!

1:46:38.357 --> 1:46:40.400
Bloody hell, Sarge.

1:46:41.527 --> 1:46:42.528
Minister.

1:46:42.903 --> 1:46:46.156
Sergeant Koo injected himself
with the virus.

1:46:52.204 --> 1:46:53.705
Yes, Mr. President.

1:46:54.414 --> 1:47:00.003
As for me,
I think it's just too dangerous.

1:47:01.630 --> 1:47:02.589
Yes.

1:47:04.132 --> 1:47:05.342
Yes, sir.

1:47:21.525 --> 1:47:22.693
What the hell?

1:47:24.069 --> 1:47:25.988
You're not going to let us land, either?

1:47:29.116 --> 1:47:33.662
We're the Korean Air Force.
Welcome to Korea.

1:47:34.705 --> 1:47:37.499
We'll escort you home.

1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:49.094
I think this is wrong. We can't turn back.

1:47:49.178 --> 1:47:51.305
We'll suffer a much bigger tragedy.

1:47:58.145 --> 1:48:00.189
From here, you need protective clothing.

1:48:01.565 --> 1:48:04.693
Is it true the plane is being escorted
to Seoul Air Base?

1:48:05.527 --> 1:48:07.487
It is currently traveling safely.

1:48:07.571 --> 1:48:09.281
Do you have measures in place?

1:48:09.364 --> 1:48:13.076
We have a system to provide
quarantine and treatment.

1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:14.786
What will you do if the virus spreads?

1:48:14.870 --> 1:48:17.623
There's basically no treatment,
will Seoul have to evacuate?

1:48:17.706 --> 1:48:20.918
Family members,
we will move to Seoul Air Base.

1:48:21.585 --> 1:48:24.379
The airplane is going there. Let's go!

1:48:26.465 --> 1:48:28.592
Meanwhile, on the Blue House's website,

1:48:28.675 --> 1:48:32.554
a petition has been uploaded
arguing against the plane's landing,

1:48:32.638 --> 1:48:35.390
given uncertainties
about the treatment's effectiveness,

1:48:35.474 --> 1:48:40.354
while simultaneously a rival petition
argues the plane should land and

1:48:40.437 --> 1:48:42.898
passengers should receive treatment.

1:48:42.981 --> 1:48:43.899
ONLINE PETITION

1:48:43.982 --> 1:48:47.110
He just rushed in, with his gun drawn...

1:48:52.324 --> 1:48:53.784
More antivirus!

1:48:54.451 --> 1:48:55.661
More!

1:49:00.499 --> 1:49:03.627
We're going to Seoul Air Base, right?

1:49:05.879 --> 1:49:07.005
Do you hear me?

1:49:08.173 --> 1:49:11.844
The landing site has changed.

1:49:13.637 --> 1:49:17.432
What do you mean? It's not Seoul Air Base?

1:49:24.481 --> 1:49:26.108
Did something happen?

1:49:26.483 --> 1:49:31.446
I'm told that at Seoul Air Base,
there are demonstrators.

1:49:33.782 --> 1:49:35.242
Don't land!

1:49:35.325 --> 1:49:37.828
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1:49:37.911 --> 1:49:41.832
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1:49:41.915 --> 1:49:46.336
BIOCHEMICAL MISSILE KI501,
CITIZENS EXPRESS RAGE AT GOVERNMENT

1:49:51.258 --> 1:49:53.010
PROTESTORS OCCUPY SEOUL AIR BASE

1:49:53.093 --> 1:49:55.804
LANDING FOR WHO?

1:49:59.433 --> 1:50:03.103
- SHOOT IT DOWN WITH A MISSILE.
- STAY AWAY.

1:50:06.899 --> 1:50:10.444
A 40% FATALITY RATE WILL KILL US ALL.
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LAND?

1:50:14.656 --> 1:50:19.244
They're telling us to die?
We all need to survive.

1:50:19.328 --> 1:50:21.246
Just trying to save themselves.

1:50:22.122 --> 1:50:24.499
That's what you did, too.

1:50:25.209 --> 1:50:27.252
When we were sick.

1:50:32.841 --> 1:50:37.638
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1:50:37.721 --> 1:50:41.600
PROTESTORS SHOUT SLOGANS AT SEOUL AIR BASE

1:50:43.227 --> 1:50:46.605
With the protests,
there are no airports where they can land.

1:50:46.688 --> 1:50:50.025
They're just circling in the air now.

1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:54.530
Sergeant!

1:50:56.698 --> 1:50:58.742
Oxygen levels are dropping.
More antiviral!

1:50:58.825 --> 1:50:59.910
More antiviral!

1:51:03.288 --> 1:51:05.749
Bloody hell.

1:51:09.837 --> 1:51:11.505
- Captain.
- Yes?

1:51:14.883 --> 1:51:16.969
No need to feel hurt.

1:51:18.846 --> 1:51:20.138
For me too,

1:51:23.141 --> 1:51:25.394
my wife dying,

1:51:26.895 --> 1:51:29.022
it wasn't your fault.

1:51:30.315 --> 1:51:35.320
But I couldn't stop myself
from hating you.

1:51:37.155 --> 1:51:38.949
At times like this,

1:51:42.077 --> 1:51:45.372
people get weak and scared.

1:51:48.292 --> 1:51:52.838
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1:51:52.921 --> 1:51:56.675
- No landing!
- No landing!

1:51:56.758 --> 1:51:59.553
- Keep away!
- Keep away!

1:52:00.762 --> 1:52:03.223
Why are you following us?

1:52:03.307 --> 1:52:06.810
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1:52:07.686 --> 1:52:09.146
Min-jung came too.

1:52:12.482 --> 1:52:14.568
Why? Don't follow after us.

1:52:14.651 --> 1:52:20.199
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1:52:20.282 --> 1:52:24.745
THEY ARE OUR FAMILIES TOO!
PLEASE LET THEM LAND!

1:52:24.828 --> 1:52:30.834
SOME PROTESTORS
IN FAVOR OF PLANE'S LANDING

1:52:31.585 --> 1:52:34.421
There are also people saying
we should land.

1:52:35.297 --> 1:52:37.132
Telling us to come back.

1:52:38.759 --> 1:52:42.429
Is it really right for us to land?

1:52:43.555 --> 1:52:48.060
What if we pass this on to all of them?

1:52:51.104 --> 1:52:53.982
What are you talking about?

1:52:54.066 --> 1:52:56.360
We still need to live!

1:52:58.195 --> 1:53:00.155
I won't die this way.

1:53:00.239 --> 1:53:02.991
Yun-seok, look.

1:53:03.075 --> 1:53:06.203
- Blisters. On your arm.
- Blisters...

1:53:08.372 --> 1:53:10.082
But I wore gloves.

1:53:11.959 --> 1:53:13.877
Let's not land.

1:53:18.549 --> 1:53:20.467
Let's just not land.

1:53:21.009 --> 1:53:23.637
What if my daughter and husband get sick?

1:53:24.137 --> 1:53:25.806
Better for me to suffer.

1:53:26.723 --> 1:53:28.350
Let's not land.

1:53:34.773 --> 1:53:38.068
Doctor.

1:53:40.362 --> 1:53:44.157
If we land, can we live?

1:54:24.615 --> 1:54:26.158
- Soo-min.
- Dad!

1:54:29.453 --> 1:54:32.289
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

1:54:32.497 --> 1:54:37.002
Dad, can we just not land?

1:54:38.629 --> 1:54:41.131
I don't want to infect my friends.

1:54:41.215 --> 1:54:46.929
I always worried
my friends would catch eczema.

1:54:50.015 --> 1:54:52.267
The passengers and flight crew

1:54:53.477 --> 1:54:55.395
have all been infected.

1:54:57.022 --> 1:55:01.777
They all say they don't want to land.

1:55:02.694 --> 1:55:04.571
Because it's too dangerous.

1:55:06.073 --> 1:55:07.783
They...

1:55:10.661 --> 1:55:12.454
don't want to do that to others.

1:55:28.387 --> 1:55:30.430
Do you have eczema, Dad?

1:55:40.065 --> 1:55:43.402
Did you catch it from me?

1:55:43.485 --> 1:55:44.987
I told you.

1:55:46.071 --> 1:55:48.073
Eczema isn't contagious.

1:55:54.121 --> 1:55:56.707
Even if we have to force
the protestors out,

1:55:56.790 --> 1:55:58.709
we must land that plane.

1:55:59.418 --> 1:56:02.296
There's a message being broadcast
from KI501.

1:56:09.344 --> 1:56:12.556
This is Sky Korea 501. Can you hear me?

1:56:13.724 --> 1:56:14.933
We hear you.

1:56:16.643 --> 1:56:20.564
All of us here aboard this plane

1:56:21.523 --> 1:56:23.317
have decided not to land.

1:56:27.779 --> 1:56:29.156
What do you mean?

1:56:30.282 --> 1:56:31.950
For me as well,

1:56:33.619 --> 1:56:35.495
everything happening now...

1:56:38.999 --> 1:56:42.336
is shocking and frightening.

1:56:45.172 --> 1:56:46.673
We know

1:56:47.966 --> 1:56:51.678
what people on the ground are scared of.

1:56:53.305 --> 1:56:54.640
We don't resent them.

1:56:56.433 --> 1:56:57.726
It's just that

1:56:59.478 --> 1:57:03.482
we were caught in a disaster

1:57:05.609 --> 1:57:07.486
that none of us wanted.

1:57:11.865 --> 1:57:13.283
We are...

1:57:15.786 --> 1:57:20.249
weak and frightened humans.

1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:28.757
But because we are human,

1:57:33.637 --> 1:57:36.056
there are things that only we can do.

1:57:39.059 --> 1:57:40.352
Now we intend...

1:57:43.063 --> 1:57:45.566
to make a decision for everyone's sake.

1:57:48.068 --> 1:57:49.570
This decision...

1:57:53.824 --> 1:57:56.243
is to not give in to this disaster,

1:57:57.744 --> 1:58:02.958
and make the honorable choice
with our humanity.

1:58:06.211 --> 1:58:07.421
Therefore,

1:58:10.257 --> 1:58:11.884
we won't land.

1:58:16.763 --> 1:58:17.931
For the last time...

1:58:20.976 --> 1:58:22.102
For the last time,

1:58:23.020 --> 1:58:24.605
we send our love

1:58:26.690 --> 1:58:29.860
to all our families.

1:58:34.907 --> 1:58:37.075
Now we will end all communications.

1:59:37.886 --> 1:59:39.346
Mom.

1:59:45.227 --> 1:59:46.436
Hello?

1:59:47.187 --> 1:59:49.356
- Min-jung.
- Mom!

1:59:49.982 --> 1:59:51.149
- Min-jung?
- Mom?

1:59:51.233 --> 1:59:52.568
Mom, where are you?

1:59:52.651 --> 1:59:55.612
Where are you? Mom...

1:59:55.696 --> 2:00:00.492
I love you, Min-jung. I'm sorry.

2:00:01.493 --> 2:00:03.745
Grandma, I'm so scared.

2:00:05.414 --> 2:00:08.584
I'm sorry for saying your food tasted bad.

2:00:09.710 --> 2:00:11.712
I miss your food.

2:00:11.795 --> 2:00:17.801
I really looked forward
to our family trip.

2:00:23.974 --> 2:00:27.978
Dad, those supplements I bought,
be sure to take them regularly.

2:00:28.061 --> 2:00:31.106
Jun-hyuk,
look after your mother and sister, okay?

2:00:31.190 --> 2:00:32.858
Look after them.

2:00:32.941 --> 2:00:37.321
Behind there, I hid some money.

2:00:37.863 --> 2:00:43.118
Buy the candy you like.

2:00:43.202 --> 2:00:44.453
Hey!

2:00:46.538 --> 2:00:47.915
I love you!

2:00:49.708 --> 2:00:50.792
Min-jung?

2:00:52.461 --> 2:00:53.712
Why doesn't it work?

2:00:54.046 --> 2:00:55.255
Min-jung.

2:00:57.382 --> 2:00:58.842
Min-jung, can you hear me?

2:00:59.259 --> 2:01:00.469
Min-jung.

2:01:01.929 --> 2:01:03.096
Min-jung.

2:01:05.182 --> 2:01:06.475
Min-jung!

2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:13.625
Sarge.

2:02:16.837 --> 2:02:19.006
Tell them to come.

2:02:22.759 --> 2:02:25.262
Tell them to come quickly.

2:02:26.597 --> 2:02:29.391
He's improving. The antivirus is working!

2:02:32.477 --> 2:02:35.564
- Is it certain?
- Tell them all to come back.

2:02:36.398 --> 2:02:41.153
I'll take responsibility.
The antivirus is working.

2:02:42.487 --> 2:02:44.448
Sergeant Koo is awake!

2:02:49.077 --> 2:02:51.288
- Contact them quickly. Tell them to come!
- Yes, sir!

2:02:51.538 --> 2:02:52.789
Sky Korea 501.

2:02:52.873 --> 2:02:55.334
The treatment is effective.
Come back immediately.

2:02:55.417 --> 2:02:57.628
We can't communicate!

2:02:58.879 --> 2:03:02.424
We can't reach them.
Their radio's turned off!

2:03:03.884 --> 2:03:05.928
The passengers' phones work, right?

2:03:06.178 --> 2:03:08.138
Let the families know, quickly!

2:03:08.639 --> 2:03:13.060
We confirmed that the antiviral works!

2:03:13.435 --> 2:03:17.731
We can't contact the plane,
so call your families and tell them.

2:03:17.814 --> 2:03:19.233
Tell them to come back!

2:03:20.901 --> 2:03:23.987
Call your families! The treatment works!

2:03:25.447 --> 2:03:27.658
- What's going on?
- Call right now.

2:03:29.117 --> 2:03:31.370
Why can't I get through?

2:03:40.504 --> 2:03:41.755
Text messages work!

2:03:41.839 --> 2:03:44.216
We can't call, but text messages work!

2:03:52.724 --> 2:03:54.101
They say to come back.

2:03:55.310 --> 2:03:56.854
They say to come back!

2:04:08.866 --> 2:04:10.325
This is L2, Im Tae-eun.

2:04:10.409 --> 2:04:13.203
The antivirus works! They said it works!

2:04:21.503 --> 2:04:23.505
This is Sky Korea 501.

2:04:24.047 --> 2:04:26.341
I just heard some news
from the passengers.

2:04:26.425 --> 2:04:27.551
Is it true?

2:04:29.469 --> 2:04:32.764
It's been confirmed! Please come back now!

2:04:34.641 --> 2:04:38.187
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me say to come back?

2:04:38.979 --> 2:04:40.314
Yes, I heard.

2:04:42.107 --> 2:04:43.442
Thank you.

2:04:52.326 --> 2:04:58.248
Family members are cheering
and hugging each other.

2:04:58.332 --> 2:05:01.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
the plane is now about to land.

2:05:01.543 --> 2:05:04.838
Please return seats and tray-tables
to their full upright position,

2:05:04.922 --> 2:05:08.050
and securely fasten your seatbelts.

2:05:08.133 --> 2:05:12.554
Please remain calm,
and follow the flight crew's instructions.

2:05:12.638 --> 2:05:14.848
Fasten your seatbelts please.

2:05:14.932 --> 2:05:18.227
Please open the window blind
and fasten your seatbelts.

2:05:18.310 --> 2:05:21.647
Please leave dangerous objects
in our care.

2:05:27.736 --> 2:05:31.782
Demonstrators are quickly clearing
from the air base.

2:05:31.865 --> 2:05:35.452
Citizens are now welcoming
the plane's landing.

2:05:39.414 --> 2:05:40.541
Do you hear me?

2:05:41.041 --> 2:05:43.502
You're out of fuel,
so the engine may turn off.

2:05:43.585 --> 2:05:46.380
You'll have to shut off power
and glide to the runway.

2:05:49.967 --> 2:05:51.927
You should land at Suwon Air Base.

2:05:54.680 --> 2:05:56.348
If I'll be gliding,

2:05:56.431 --> 2:06:01.270
from cruising altitude to landing,
I'll need about 20 minutes.

2:06:01.895 --> 2:06:03.355
I won't make it that far.

2:06:03.438 --> 2:06:05.440
You've got a tail wind,
so it should be fine.

2:06:05.524 --> 2:06:08.694
I think Seongmu Airfield will be better.

2:06:08.777 --> 2:06:10.946
I landed there years ago
when I did my training.

2:06:11.029 --> 2:06:12.114
That's too close.

2:06:12.197 --> 2:06:14.783
If you can't slow down,
you'll overshoot the runway.

2:06:14.867 --> 2:06:18.328
With a tail wind, and only one runway,
it's too dangerous!

2:06:20.706 --> 2:06:22.708
It's a head wind right now.

2:06:22.791 --> 2:06:25.460
The wind keeps changing direction
every ten minutes.

2:06:25.961 --> 2:06:27.796
Is that forecast accurate?

2:06:37.389 --> 2:06:40.767
To hell with it. I'm going to Seongmu.

2:06:41.435 --> 2:06:45.272
Hey, First Officer Choi!
I'm going to Seongmu.

2:06:54.698 --> 2:06:55.991
Honestly,

2:06:56.825 --> 2:07:00.412
I'm so sorry to you about what happened,

2:07:00.746 --> 2:07:03.916
but however much I think of it,

2:07:04.458 --> 2:07:06.376
I made the right decision back then.

2:07:06.919 --> 2:07:08.420
I think so, too.

2:07:14.051 --> 2:07:16.094
I'd have done the same.

2:07:27.898 --> 2:07:29.441
We're going to Seongmu.

2:07:30.108 --> 2:07:31.026
It's too dangerous!

2:07:31.109 --> 2:07:33.862
He'll be coming in fast,
and the brakes might not work.

2:07:33.946 --> 2:07:37.407
If he can't reduce his speed,
they'll crash beyond the runway.

2:07:42.329 --> 2:07:44.581
He's already turned the plane.

2:07:46.708 --> 2:07:48.043
No choice now.

2:07:48.544 --> 2:07:50.754
They're going to Seongmu, get ready!

2:07:52.464 --> 2:07:55.843
This just in. Facing a fuel shortage,

2:07:55.926 --> 2:08:00.514
KI501 has changed course
and will land at Seongmu Airfield.

2:08:10.232 --> 2:08:13.151
They've lost power.
They must be almost out of fuel.

2:08:20.409 --> 2:08:21.869
What's happening?

2:08:22.244 --> 2:08:24.037
What's going on?

2:08:27.541 --> 2:08:29.918
They're gone from the radar.
The engine has turned off.

2:08:30.002 --> 2:08:31.420
Can you detect any radio waves?

2:08:34.548 --> 2:08:37.968
They're gliding now with the engines off.

2:08:42.097 --> 2:08:44.308
- They're headed for the runway!
- It's too fast.

2:08:44.391 --> 2:08:46.393
At this speed
they'll shoot past the runway!

2:09:00.115 --> 2:09:02.159
They've turned from the runway!

2:09:12.252 --> 2:09:15.005
He's circling to reduce velocity.

2:09:16.006 --> 2:09:17.716
What's my altitude reading?

2:09:18.383 --> 2:09:20.761
- Eight thousand feet.
- Distance to runway?

2:09:20.844 --> 2:09:22.054
Six miles.

2:09:49.039 --> 2:09:50.666
The wind is changing.

2:09:50.916 --> 2:09:53.460
The speed is decreasing.
Now's the time to land!

2:09:58.882 --> 2:10:01.510
It's turned again. It missed the landing!

2:10:02.928 --> 2:10:05.389
- What the...
- I'm going around one more time.

2:10:05.472 --> 2:10:07.933
The altitude is plunging.
They're going to crash!

2:10:41.300 --> 2:10:42.968
The engine just turned on.

2:10:43.510 --> 2:10:45.846
It seems they still had some fuel!

2:12:41.211 --> 2:12:44.339
Well, based on
Ryu Jin-seok's internet search history,

2:12:44.756 --> 2:12:48.677
and data received from
a forensic restoration of his hard drive,

2:12:49.428 --> 2:12:52.514
it seems
that after the death of his mother,

2:12:52.890 --> 2:12:57.686
he became confused,
lost his sense of identity

2:12:57.769 --> 2:13:00.647
and then began to plan this attack.

2:13:00.731 --> 2:13:02.274
What are your thoughts?

2:13:04.401 --> 2:13:08.572
Isn't that just speculation?

2:13:09.489 --> 2:13:12.117
It could just all be nonsense.

2:13:12.201 --> 2:13:14.828
I'm asking for your opinion.

2:13:15.287 --> 2:13:17.247
You must have one.

2:13:17.331 --> 2:13:19.958
If you're asking what I think,

2:13:21.335 --> 2:13:26.590
I can't understand or speculate
why a normal person

2:13:27.049 --> 2:13:30.802
would decide to kill 150 people.

2:13:30.886 --> 2:13:33.680
But there exist some people

2:13:35.015 --> 2:13:39.770
who are steeped in a vice beyond reason.

2:13:40.854 --> 2:13:45.025
And they can take away those
who are precious to us.

2:13:46.151 --> 2:13:47.528
Well, anyway,

2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:52.366
that's a question for the Minister
of the Interior and Safety.

2:13:53.283 --> 2:13:58.622
I think Sergeant Koo's sacrifice
was also remarkable,

2:13:58.705 --> 2:14:02.918
though the amount of virus he injected
was so large.

2:14:03.377 --> 2:14:07.548
I understand
he's no longer able to function normally?

2:14:07.631 --> 2:14:11.718
You ordered the landing
without full verification.

2:14:11.802 --> 2:14:13.220
As a public official,

2:14:13.303 --> 2:14:16.223
don't you think
it was too risky a decision?

2:14:22.479 --> 2:14:24.439
That's why I resigned.

2:14:44.543 --> 2:14:47.880
- Hello!
- Soo-min, there you are!

2:14:49.506 --> 2:14:50.674
Hello!

2:14:51.466 --> 2:14:53.260
- Hello.
- He's doing good, right?

2:14:53.343 --> 2:14:56.388
Sure, he's in the back. Everyone's there.

2:15:20.954 --> 2:15:22.039
How is he?

2:15:22.789 --> 2:15:24.041
Almost all better now.

2:15:24.124 --> 2:15:29.463
Doctor says he's so strong-willed,
he'll be breathing on his own soon.

2:15:29.796 --> 2:15:31.882
Did you see him move his arm now?

2:15:31.965 --> 2:15:33.217
- Really?
- Yes.

2:15:33.300 --> 2:15:35.344
Soon he'll be washing his face,

2:15:35.427 --> 2:15:38.680
and when Min-jung gets married,
he'll probably be walking!
