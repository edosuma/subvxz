00:32.195 --> 00:35.632
<i>There's a moment of orderly
silence before a football play begins.</i>

00:36.033 --> 00:40.333
<i>Players are in position, linemen
are frozen, and anything is possible.</i>

00:40.504 --> 00:43.564
<i>Almost Indian-summer
weather here in mid-November.</i>

00:45.209 --> 00:50.112
<i>Then, like a traffic accident,
stuff begins to randomly collide.</i>

00:50.281 --> 00:53.045
<i>From the snap of the ball
to the snap of the first bone...</i>

00:53.217 --> 00:55.947
<i>...is closer to four seconds than five.</i>

00:56.120 --> 00:59.021
<i>First and 10.
Riggins, flea flicker back to Theismann.</i>

00:59.190 --> 01:01.090
<i>Theismann's in a lot of trouble.</i>

01:04.128 --> 01:07.393
<i>One Mississippi.
Joe Theismann, the Redskins' quarterback...</i>

01:07.565 --> 01:10.033
<i>...takes the snap and hands off
to his running back.</i>

01:10.201 --> 01:11.532
<i>First and 10. Riggins-</i>

01:11.702 --> 01:13.294
<i>Two Mississippi.</i>

01:13.471 --> 01:15.632
<i>It's a trick play, a flea flicker...</i>

01:15.806 --> 01:18.741
<i>...and the running back tosses the ball
back to the quarterback.</i>

01:18.909 --> 01:21.241
<i>Flea flicker back to Theismann.</i>

01:21.712 --> 01:22.838
<i>Three Mississippi.</i>

01:23.014 --> 01:27.041
<i>Up to now, the play's been defined
by what the quarterback sees.</i>

01:27.218 --> 01:30.619
<i>It’s about to be defined
by what he doesn't.</i>

01:31.389 --> 01:32.720
<i>Four Mississippi.</i>

01:32.890 --> 01:36.519
<i>Lawrence Taylor is the best
defensive player in the NFL...</i>

01:36.694 --> 01:40.061
<i>...and has been from the time he
stepped onto the field as a rookie.</i>

01:40.231 --> 01:42.028
<i>Theismann's in a lot of trouble.</i>

01:42.199 --> 01:43.723
<i>And it was Lawrence Taylor...</i>

01:43.901 --> 01:48.099
<i>...who slammed Theismann to the ground
at the 42-yard line. The blitz was on...</i>

01:48.272 --> 01:51.571
<i>He will also change
the game of football as we know it.</i>

01:51.742 --> 01:54.267
<i>We'll look at it with
the reverse angle one more time.</i>

01:54.445 --> 01:57.312
<i>And I suggest if your stomach is weak,
you just don't watch.</i>

01:57.481 --> 01:59.540
<i>Legendary quarterback Joe Theismann...</i>

01:59.717 --> 02:02.185
<i>...never played another down of football.</i>

02:04.355 --> 02:06.687
<i>Now, y'all would guess that,
more often than not...</i>

02:06.857 --> 02:10.156
<i>...the highest paid player
on an NFL team is a quarterback...</i>

02:10.328 --> 02:11.818
<i>...and you'd be right.</i>

02:11.996 --> 02:14.726
<i>But what you probably don't know
is, more often than not...</i>

02:14.899 --> 02:19.598
<i>...the second highest paid player is,
thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle.</i>

02:19.770 --> 02:23.706
<i>Because as every housewife knows, the
first check you write is for the mortgage...</i>

02:23.874 --> 02:26.365
<i>...but the second is for the insurance.</i>

02:26.544 --> 02:31.106
<i>And the left tackle's job is to protect the
quarterback from what he can't see coming.</i>

02:31.282 --> 02:33.045
<i>To protect his blind side.</i>

02:33.284 --> 02:37.050
<i>The ideal left tackle is big,
but a lot of people are big.</i>

02:37.221 --> 02:40.190
<i>He's wide in the butt
and massive in the thighs.</i>

02:40.358 --> 02:44.454
<i>He has long arms, giant hands
and feet as quick as a hiccup.</i>

02:46.630 --> 02:49.155
<i>This is a rare and expensive
combination...</i>

02:49.333 --> 02:54.066
<i>...the need for which can be traced to that
Monday night game and Lawrence Taylor.</i>

02:54.238 --> 02:58.868
<i>For on that day, he not only
altered Joe Theismann's life...</i>

02:59.043 --> 03:00.442
<i>...but mine as well.</i>

03:06.951 --> 03:08.816
Mr. Oher.

03:08.986 --> 03:10.920
Mr. Oher.

03:11.122 --> 03:13.955
Do you understand?
Do you know why I'm here?

03:15.092 --> 03:16.855
To investigate?

03:17.027 --> 03:18.654
Yes. To investigate.

03:20.531 --> 03:24.433
I'm here to investigate
your odd... predicament.

03:25.035 --> 03:28.061
Do you find it odd, your predicament?

03:29.774 --> 03:31.469
Michael?

03:32.109 --> 03:34.009
I don't know.

03:35.045 --> 03:38.481
- Can I-? Can I leave now?
- No, you can’t.

05:33.430 --> 05:35.728
Where's Coach Cotton's office?

05:36.367 --> 05:38.130
Thanks, man.

05:47.978 --> 05:49.878
They said you were the coach.

05:50.614 --> 05:51.911
Bert Cotton.

05:52.783 --> 05:56.241
Tony Hamilton, but everybody
just calls me Big Tony.

06:00.591 --> 06:03.116
Hey, Big Mike, check it out.

06:05.129 --> 06:07.222
Not even locked.

06:08.198 --> 06:10.632
White people are crazy.

06:14.438 --> 06:16.838
<i>I promised my ma, Boo,
on her deathbed...</i>

06:17.007 --> 06:20.670
...that I'd get my son, Steven, out of
public school and into a church school.

06:20.844 --> 06:25.247
I appreciate that, Tony,
but I'm not involved with admissions.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.907
I just figured maybe
I can come talk to you...

06:28.085 --> 06:30.553
...seeing as though
you might need some players.

06:31.322 --> 06:35.918
- What kind of sport does he play?
- Anything with a ball. The boy's good too.

06:36.093 --> 06:38.926
Classes start in a week.
It'd have to be for next semester.

06:40.331 --> 06:41.958
I know what you're thinking, coach.

06:42.366 --> 06:45.267
But look here, I got money, all right?

06:45.436 --> 06:48.530
See, I'm a mechanic at Wilson’s Auto,
the other side of town.

06:48.872 --> 06:53.605
Well, look, what if somebody drops out
or moves? Could they get in then?

06:54.445 --> 06:56.811
"They"? You only mentioned one son.

06:56.981 --> 07:00.109
That’s right, Steven.
But there's another boy.

07:00.451 --> 07:03.784
- Heh. Another boy?
- Yeah.

07:06.824 --> 07:10.282
Big Mike. Sleeps on my couch
from time to time.

07:10.461 --> 07:13.021
It's a bad deal. You know,
his mom's on that crack pipe.

07:13.197 --> 07:16.655
He ain't got nobody else. He just
wanted to come along for the ride.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.695
- They're here?
- Yeah.

07:19.737 --> 07:23.173
Now, the little one, that’s Steven...

07:23.340 --> 07:24.932
...and the big one...

07:25.109 --> 07:26.201
Big Mike.

07:35.252 --> 07:36.844
Swish!

07:39.356 --> 07:41.381
Big Mike! Ha-ha.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.626
Come on.

07:51.502 --> 07:53.094
Mother of God.

07:54.571 --> 07:57.540
<i>Steven Hamilton's paperwork
looks acceptable to me...</i>

07:57.708 --> 08:00.939
...and I believe he'll do fine.
But this other kid...

08:01.111 --> 08:03.170
- Big Mike.
- Michael Oher...

08:03.347 --> 08:05.781
...gives us no reason to believe that...

08:05.949 --> 08:09.316
...based on his records,
that he would be successful here.

08:09.486 --> 08:10.680
Well, how bad could it be?

08:10.854 --> 08:14.381
We're not exactly sure how old he is,
due to his lack of records.

08:14.558 --> 08:17.550
He has a measured IQ of 80,
which is sixth percentile.

08:18.128 --> 08:22.394
His grade-point average
begins with zero, 0.6.

08:22.566 --> 08:24.500
Everyone passed him along.

08:24.668 --> 08:28.104
They gave him D's so they could
hand their problem off to the next school.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.405
He's a brave kid.

08:34.178 --> 08:38.706
For wanting to come here,
for wanting a quality education.

08:38.881 --> 08:43.376
An education denied him by
the poor quality of schools he's attended.

08:43.554 --> 08:47.354
Most kids with his background wouldn’t
come within 200 miles of this place.

08:47.524 --> 08:52.484
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest
in this young man’s athletic abilities.

08:52.663 --> 08:55.632
He wouldn’t be able to play sports
until he got his grades up.

08:55.799 --> 08:57.892
Forget sports.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.592
Look at the wall.

08:59.770 --> 09:03.968
"Christian." We either take that
seriously or we paint over it.

09:04.875 --> 09:08.276
You don't admit Michael Oher
because of sports.

09:08.445 --> 09:11.505
You admit him because
it's the right thing to do.

09:56.994 --> 09:58.655
Class, this is Mike Oher...

09:58.829 --> 10:02.458
...and he's new here so I expect
you all to make him feel welcome.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.828
Mike, just take any empty seat.

10:08.338 --> 10:11.398
This is a quiz based on the information...

10:11.575 --> 10:15.067
...you learned last year
in your science curriculum.

10:15.245 --> 10:18.009
Don't worry, it's not gonna be graded.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.912
I just wanna see how much information
we need to hit again.

10:21.084 --> 10:23.416
Just answer whatever you know.

10:55.786 --> 10:58.050
Thank you.

11:14.638 --> 11:18.199
- Can I leave now?
- Yeah.

11:22.179 --> 11:23.441
Take your book.

11:41.899 --> 11:43.992
I'm tired
of having someone always in our home.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.930
I'm tired of him eating all the food.

11:46.103 --> 11:48.537
Look, man, you gotta be Christian
about this thing.

11:48.705 --> 11:50.900
Let somebody else
be Christian about this thing.

11:51.074 --> 11:54.271
Dee, come on, I can’t kick him out
on the street like he's some dog.

11:54.444 --> 11:56.344
Let somebody else
take the responsibility.

11:56.513 --> 11:59.141
What, you want me to go to
Beale Street and drop him off?

11:59.316 --> 12:01.307
When do I have time
just to be with you?

12:01.485 --> 12:06.218
All right, all right. Whatever.
You win. I'll take care of it.

12:10.727 --> 12:13.161
I don't care if Patrick Ramsey
approved the chair.

12:13.330 --> 12:16.766
He's an NFL quarterback,
not Martha fricking Stewart.

12:16.967 --> 12:21.097
Because there is a difference
between Bunny Williams and a La-Z-Boy.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.762
<i>No, see, when MTV Cribs
comes to his house...</i>

12:23.941 --> 12:25.806
...he’ll be showing off
his home theater.

12:25.976 --> 12:28.501
All I'm gonna see
is a brown Barcalounger.

12:28.679 --> 12:31.307
No, listen to me, I'm the designer,
my name is on it.

12:31.481 --> 12:34.678
Deliver what I ordered, all right?
Thank you.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.052
Yeah!

12:48.432 --> 12:51.026
What’d I miss?
- Collins just got a dig.

12:51.201 --> 12:53.829
It's girls' volleyball, Mom.
You didn't miss anything.

12:56.740 --> 12:57.866
Oh!

12:58.041 --> 13:00.976
- Come on, Collins, move your feet.
Good job, Collins.

13:01.144 --> 13:02.236
Go.

13:06.283 --> 13:07.545
We'll wait for you outside.

13:07.718 --> 13:10.278
Don't double condition in
the shower, you have homework.

13:10.454 --> 13:11.921
I'm going to Cannon’s to study.

13:12.089 --> 13:17.550
SJ! SJ, do not go in the girls' locker
room again. Come here! SJ, come here!

13:30.340 --> 13:33.275
<i>The big kid's been here
for, what, a month?</i>

13:33.677 --> 13:35.577
He's still not cutting it in my class.

13:35.746 --> 13:39.443
Why does Admissions do this?
I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.

13:39.616 --> 13:41.277
They're just setting him up to fail.

13:41.451 --> 13:43.783
I don't think he has any idea
of what I'm teaching.

13:43.954 --> 13:46.445
And how would you know if he did?
He won't even talk.

13:47.424 --> 13:48.448
He writes.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.525
His name. Barely.

13:51.695 --> 13:54.255
He threw this in the trash can.

13:57.968 --> 14:00.801
"I look and I see white everywhere:

14:00.971 --> 14:06.136
White walls, white floors,
and a lot of white people.

14:06.476 --> 14:11.743
The teachers do not know I have no idea
of anything they are talking about.

14:11.915 --> 14:14.975
I do not wanna listen to anyone,
especially the teachers.

14:15.152 --> 14:20.112
They are giving homework and expecting
me to do the problems on my own.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.890
I have never done homework in my life.

14:23.693 --> 14:28.460
I go to the bathroom,
look in the mirror and say:

14:28.765 --> 14:30.460
"This is not Michael Oher."

14:35.338 --> 14:37.431
He entitled it "White Walls."

14:37.707 --> 14:39.572
How's the spelling?

14:51.488 --> 14:52.955
Hi.

15:00.363 --> 15:03.924
Smile at them.
It lets them know you're their friend.

15:08.872 --> 15:10.567
You're Big Mike, right?

15:11.808 --> 15:12.968
Well, I'm Sean.

15:13.143 --> 15:17.944
But everyone calls me SJ. It's for
Sean Junior. My father's name is Sean.

15:18.115 --> 15:22.017
Sean Tuohy? He was a basketball star
at Ole Miss, point guard.

15:22.185 --> 15:24.119
Now he owns like a million Taco Bells.

15:34.731 --> 15:36.562
Who is that, SJ?
Big Mike.

15:38.468 --> 15:40.561
Get your feet off my dash.

15:41.638 --> 15:43.037
Thank you. Put on your seat belt.

15:51.982 --> 15:53.677
Big Mike?

15:56.553 --> 16:00.751
Mike, I got a call from someone
at the police department.

16:04.628 --> 16:10.692
You remember a story in the papers
a while back about a man who...

16:10.901 --> 16:13.335
...fell off an overpass?

16:13.503 --> 16:15.698
No one knew who he was.

16:15.872 --> 16:20.673
They didn't know if he jumped or if...

16:21.711 --> 16:25.909
Well, anyway, he- He passed away.

16:29.252 --> 16:31.982
Mike, that man was your father.

16:35.258 --> 16:38.159
They've been looking for
somebody to notify and they-

16:38.328 --> 16:41.456
They found your name in our registry.

16:43.366 --> 16:45.926
I'm really sorry, son.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.032
Were you close to him?

16:57.414 --> 17:00.076
When's the last time you saw him?

17:05.255 --> 17:07.314
I don't know.

18:39.983 --> 18:42.713
- He knows it!
- Who knows it and what does he know?

18:42.986 --> 18:46.513
The material. Michael Oher.
I gave him this test verbally.

18:46.690 --> 18:50.057
- Is that even allowed?
- A "C"? On how big a curve?

18:50.226 --> 18:53.127
He's been listening all along.
It's amazing what he's absorbed.

18:53.296 --> 18:57.357
And, trust me, he's listening to you too.
Now, his reading level is low...

18:57.534 --> 19:01.026
...and he's got no idea
how to learn in a classroom...

19:01.204 --> 19:06.107
I'm not saying he's gonna pass,
but Big Mike is not stupid.

19:06.276 --> 19:08.574
Hey. Good job.
Mama. Daddy.

19:08.745 --> 19:10.762
Good job.
Hey I got a question for you.

19:10.812 --> 19:11.403
Yeah?

19:11.581 --> 19:15.312
There was a little girl about two rows
back. What was her name?

19:15.485 --> 19:17.680
- Oh, that was Kinsey.
- Kinsey, yeah.

19:17.854 --> 19:20.322
I saw your little Indian feathers
get all ruffled up.

19:20.490 --> 19:21.684
Yeah! She is nice.

19:21.858 --> 19:23.826
SJ. Don't let this go to your head...

19:23.993 --> 19:26.791
...but I thought you were
very convincing in the role of...

19:26.963 --> 19:28.794
- Indian Number 3?
- Yes.

19:28.965 --> 19:32.366
I tried out for the chief,
but they gave it to Andy Sung.

19:32.535 --> 19:36.596
I can’t be sure, but I think there's
some multi-cultural-bias thing working.

19:36.773 --> 19:39.469
Or maybe they just thought
that he'd make a better chief.

19:39.642 --> 19:41.439
Dad, he's, like, Chinese.

19:41.611 --> 19:43.010
Yeah, and you're Irish.

19:43.179 --> 19:45.739
If you weren't the chief,
how did you get the headdress?

19:45.915 --> 19:49.146
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more
of those free quesadilla tickets.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.851
And where does the acorn fall?

19:54.023 --> 19:57.015
Hey, don't laugh too hard.
The quesadillas saved our ass.

19:57.193 --> 19:58.785
Don't use the A-word.

20:04.734 --> 20:05.996
What is he wearing?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.435
It's freezing.

20:09.606 --> 20:12.040
- What's his name again?
- Big Mike.

20:12.942 --> 20:15.172
Where is he going?

20:16.279 --> 20:19.407
Hey, Big Mike. Where you headed?

20:19.582 --> 20:20.606
Gym.

20:21.384 --> 20:22.408
Go ahead.

20:34.597 --> 20:35.689
Turn around.

20:43.273 --> 20:44.467
Big Mike!

20:44.641 --> 20:46.506
Stop the car.

20:50.447 --> 20:51.539
Big Mike.

20:52.449 --> 20:55.009
Hey. My name's Leigh Anne Tuohy.
My kids go to Wingate.

20:55.185 --> 20:56.812
You said you were going to the gym?

20:58.354 --> 20:59.844
School gym's closed.

21:00.356 --> 21:01.948
Why were you going to the gym?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.394
Big Mike, why were you
going to the gym?

21:07.730 --> 21:09.698
Because it's- It's warm.

21:11.201 --> 21:12.998
Do you have anyplace to stay tonight?

21:14.904 --> 21:16.201
Don't you dare lie to me.

21:29.152 --> 21:33.248
I've seen that look many times.
She's about to get her way.

21:34.190 --> 21:35.248
Come on.

21:37.694 --> 21:39.127
Come on.

21:42.332 --> 21:44.266
SJ, make room.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.095
Get inside.

21:47.804 --> 21:49.294
Come on.

22:00.783 --> 22:03.115
- Where we going?
- Home.

22:18.301 --> 22:22.863
I know, it's my favorite part.
He's so cute.

22:23.306 --> 22:25.399
How'd the dork do in the school play?

22:30.013 --> 22:31.310
Um...

22:31.481 --> 22:32.641
Okay.

22:33.082 --> 22:36.074
Collins, do you know Big Mike
from school?

22:37.587 --> 22:41.284
I'd give you the guest bedroom,
but it's full of sample boxes.

22:41.457 --> 22:44.756
And the sectional in the family room
slides apart when you sleep on it.

22:44.928 --> 22:47.123
Least that’s what Sean says.

22:47.297 --> 22:49.060
Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?

22:49.332 --> 22:50.924
Only when he's bad. All right.

22:51.100 --> 22:55.469
The powder room is right there and we
will be upstairs if you need us. All right?

22:56.172 --> 22:59.266
Okay. Sleep tight, honey.

23:52.562 --> 23:54.052
<i>Was this a bad idea?</i>

23:54.330 --> 23:55.354
What?

23:55.531 --> 23:58.967
Don't lie there and pretend like you're
not thinking the same thing as me.

23:59.135 --> 24:02.627
Tell me what you're thinking so I'll know
what's supposed to be on my mind.

24:02.805 --> 24:04.932
How well do you know Big Mike?

24:05.108 --> 24:07.576
Case you hadn't noticed,
he didn't have much to say.

24:07.744 --> 24:10.304
What's the big deal?
It's just for one night, right?

24:12.215 --> 24:14.809
It is just for one night,
right, Leigh Anne?

24:17.420 --> 24:19.820
You don't think he'll steal anything,
do you?

24:20.957 --> 24:23.425
I guess we'll know in the morning.

24:35.538 --> 24:37.506
<i>...talking about Mississippi and Arkansas.</i>

24:37.674 --> 24:39.141
<i>The fight's gotten more interesting.</i>

24:39.308 --> 24:42.675
Well, if you hear a scream,
call the insurance adjuster.

25:02.131 --> 25:03.860
Mike?

25:13.209 --> 25:15.370
Big Mike?

25:15.912 --> 25:17.675
Mike?

25:30.626 --> 25:32.457
Big Mike!

25:40.570 --> 25:42.299
You gonna make me
walk the whole way?

25:43.072 --> 25:45.063
All right, then.

25:45.575 --> 25:46.974
Where are you going?

25:47.877 --> 25:48.901
I don't know.

25:49.479 --> 25:53.609
Well, are you spending Thanksgiving
with your family?

25:53.916 --> 25:56.612
<i>Those 40, 50 guys
from State here can quiet them down.</i>

25:56.786 --> 25:59.220
<i>As you mentioned,
the Mississippi State defensive-</i>

25:59.388 --> 26:01.253
- Come and get it, y'all.
- Yeah, baby!

26:01.424 --> 26:03.016
Let's eat!

26:03.359 --> 26:04.656
Come on!

26:05.495 --> 26:06.553
It's that Rebel turkey.

26:07.497 --> 26:10.330
Thank your mother for driving
to the store and getting this.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.161
Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Mama.

26:12.335 --> 26:15.270
Food and football.
Eat all you want.

26:15.438 --> 26:18.498
Come on. Hustle, hustle.
We gotta get back over there.

26:18.674 --> 26:20.369
Going, Dad.

26:20.810 --> 26:22.175
Don't take my spot.

26:22.345 --> 26:24.813
- No rushing, SJ. SJ, slow down.
- Coming through.

26:24.981 --> 26:28.473
No.
This is fantastic.

26:29.652 --> 26:33.679
Oh, y’all, I forgot
the potato salad. How's Ole Miss doing?

26:33.856 --> 26:36.347
They're kicking butt.

26:36.993 --> 26:39.052
<i>One wide receiver left...
Good, huh?</i>

26:39.228 --> 26:42.288
<i>...and one corner, number 30,
out in press coverage-</i>

26:42.465 --> 26:44.490
Sean, salad.

26:45.635 --> 26:47.500
It's great, Mom.
So good. Thanks, Mama.

26:47.670 --> 26:48.762
Yeah, Mama.

26:48.938 --> 26:51.998
<i>Nice little surge,
but not much running inside.</i>

26:52.175 --> 26:54.541
<i>Come on.
- And the Rebels got third and long here.</i>

26:54.710 --> 26:58.237
<i>Birdsong and Mawhinney on the tackle.
Ole Miss, five of 10 on third downs.</i>

26:58.414 --> 27:01.076
<i>From the 26, third down and six
for the Rebs here.</i>

27:01.250 --> 27:02.274
Come on, defense.

27:02.451 --> 27:05.579
<i>I formation. The rain is slow,
let's see if they try a pass or not.</i>

27:05.755 --> 27:08.155
<i>Now Turner goes in motion
out of the backfield.</i>

27:08.324 --> 27:10.087
<i>State showing blitz, Manning to throw.</i>

27:10.259 --> 27:13.558
<i>Runs to his right,
throws it at the feet of the-</i>

27:13.729 --> 27:15.424
- Hey. Mom.
- What?

27:15.598 --> 27:17.429
But it's Thanksgiving.

27:19.235 --> 27:22.329
- Wow.
- Why are we eating in here?

27:29.579 --> 27:30.944
Shall we say grace?

27:48.598 --> 27:53.865
Heavenly Father, we thank you for
all the many blessings on this family.

27:54.036 --> 27:56.698
We thank you for bringing us
a new friend.

27:57.373 --> 28:00.536
And we ask that you look after us
on this holiday season...

28:00.710 --> 28:05.579
...that we may never forget
how very fortunate we are. Amen.

28:05.748 --> 28:07.238
Amen.

28:09.252 --> 28:12.153
Let's check the score.
Up by 10.

28:13.589 --> 28:16.387
Collins, can you pass me
the green beans, please?

28:16.893 --> 28:21.125
Don't pick it with your fingers.
Just take- Take a sp- Ta-

28:23.766 --> 28:26.462
- SJ, elbows.
- Sorry.

28:29.705 --> 28:32.799
So, Big Mike. You like to shop?

28:34.744 --> 28:37.679
Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna
have to show you how it's done.

28:43.085 --> 28:44.950
I got clothes.

28:45.121 --> 28:47.180
You have clothes.

28:47.356 --> 28:50.848
And an extra T-shirt in a plastic bag
does not a wardrobe make.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.784
I have clothes.

28:52.962 --> 28:55.954
Fine, let's go get them.
Just tell me where I'm going.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.266
All right.

29:08.077 --> 29:13.606
Tell me everything I need to know about
you. Who takes care of you? A mother?

29:13.783 --> 29:17.913
Do you have a mother?
A grandmother maybe?

29:22.325 --> 29:26.455
Tell you what, Big Mike, we can do this
the easy way or we can do this the hard way.

29:26.629 --> 29:28.563
You take your pick.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.033
Fine.

29:33.336 --> 29:39.036
Tell me just one thing I should know
about you. Just- Just one.

29:41.277 --> 29:43.370
I don't like to be called Big Mike.

29:45.081 --> 29:46.480
Okay.

29:46.849 --> 29:50.717
Tell you what, from now on,
to me, you're Michael.

29:51.187 --> 29:52.745
Okay?

29:54.357 --> 29:56.518
So, Michael...

29:58.594 --> 30:00.186
...where are we headed?

30:00.363 --> 30:04.026
I kid y’all not, y’all. I'm gonna
tell it. Make it rain and everything, right?

30:04.200 --> 30:08.637
Shorty- Shorty gets to the top of the pole.
She just done-

30:12.174 --> 30:14.142
That's nice.
Yo, check it.

30:14.310 --> 30:17.302
What's that, a seven?
For real.

30:17.480 --> 30:19.243
Yeah.

30:19.915 --> 30:21.212
Yeah, right there.

30:21.384 --> 30:24.410
- You know them?
- Man, I ain't got no idea, shorty.

30:24.587 --> 30:26.953
This is where your mother lives?

30:27.356 --> 30:30.120
- Let's go get them.
- Don't- Don't get out.

30:30.292 --> 30:32.852
Who's gonna help you
carry your clothes, Michael?

30:36.132 --> 30:38.191
Don't get out the car.

30:44.673 --> 30:46.402
Snowflake.

30:47.009 --> 30:49.409
Oh. That's Big Mike, man.

30:50.046 --> 30:52.844
Oh, Big Mike is in the house.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.577
Big Mike! Where you been, baby?

30:59.488 --> 31:04.152
Hey, who that fine thing you got driving you
around now, like Miss Daisy or something?

31:04.326 --> 31:05.657
Hey, David.

31:05.828 --> 31:09.924
You need to holler at me about them
sneakers, man. I'm gonna take care of you.

31:13.102 --> 31:15.900
I run this over here in Hurt Village.
Baby, believe that.

31:19.742 --> 31:24.042
Ey. Hey, D, watch this. They always
go for the wink, watch this.

31:24.213 --> 31:27.307
There you go. Yeah, snowflake. Ha-ha-ha.

31:27.683 --> 31:30.413
You like that. Yeah.

32:06.021 --> 32:09.923
That girl will not listen to me.
She don't listen to nobody.

32:10.092 --> 32:12.959
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi, Big Mike.

32:20.736 --> 32:22.135
<i>She wasn't home.</i>

32:25.808 --> 32:29.209
Well, we can come back.

32:32.081 --> 32:35.107
She probably moved to a nicer place.

32:45.828 --> 32:50.060
I've been in Memphis my whole life
and never been anywhere near here.

32:51.700 --> 32:55.636
- You're gonna take care of me, right?
I got your back.

32:58.841 --> 33:01.366
Now just follow me, y’all. Uh-huh.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.102
There we go.

33:03.279 --> 33:06.305
Oh, we also got apparel for the ladies.

33:06.482 --> 33:09.940
But everything we got that'll fit him
is right here.

33:12.588 --> 33:13.680
This is it?

33:13.989 --> 33:17.288
If this is all you got, why's it say
"Big and Tall" on the sign?

33:17.459 --> 33:20.860
Big and Tall. You need
Bigger and Taller.

33:22.932 --> 33:25.059
- Holler if you need me.
Thank you.

33:25.234 --> 33:29.728
- See anything you like?
- Hey, I got just what you're looking for.

33:29.905 --> 33:31.896
One thing I know about shopping
is that...

33:32.074 --> 33:34.838
...if you don't love it in the store,
you won't wear it.

33:35.010 --> 33:36.978
The store's where you like it the best.

33:37.146 --> 33:40.445
So before you choose something,
think of yourself wearing it.

33:40.616 --> 33:43.744
Say to yourself, "Is this me?"

33:46.789 --> 33:48.586
What about this one?

33:52.962 --> 33:56.420
Well, this is not atrocious, this...

33:56.832 --> 34:00.632
No? All right, well, you go look
over there and I'll go look over here.

34:03.973 --> 34:07.636
Why would you need this many coats
out of plastic?

34:09.911 --> 34:14.143
Good Lord. What is this made out of?

34:18.420 --> 34:22.982
That's the one? That's the one you like?

34:24.927 --> 34:26.985
Well, all right, then.

34:40.943 --> 34:43.503
Have a great day! Learn something.

34:52.054 --> 34:54.112
Oh, don't get your panties in a wad.

34:56.859 --> 34:59.657
The best part about Paris was the food.

34:59.828 --> 35:02.228
They use sauce like we use gravy.

35:02.398 --> 35:05.663
- I had to join a gym the day I got back.
Oh.

35:07.236 --> 35:09.830
Have y’all spent much time
on the other side of town?

35:10.005 --> 35:13.304
- Where exactly are you talking about?
- Alabama Street, Hurt Village.

35:13.475 --> 35:15.807
Hurt Village? That sounds like a threat.

35:15.978 --> 35:17.411
Not far off.

35:17.579 --> 35:19.843
I think it might hurt me to go there.

35:20.015 --> 35:21.915
It would hurt your reputation
to go there.

35:22.084 --> 35:25.576
Actually, I'm from there but didn't mind
hard work, and look where I am now.

35:25.754 --> 35:27.415
Eating an $18 salad?

35:29.124 --> 35:30.887
And it's a little soggy, to be honest.

35:31.060 --> 35:34.655
What is this sudden interest in the projects?
Another one of your "charities"?

35:34.830 --> 35:38.960
Wait. Project for the projects.
Ooh. That's catchy!

35:39.134 --> 35:40.692
Y'all, money would raise itself.

35:40.869 --> 35:42.996
Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.

35:44.373 --> 35:47.069
- Break out your checkbooks.
Yes.

35:47.242 --> 35:50.803
SJ, you have two more minutes
on that Playbox thing, all right?

35:50.979 --> 35:53.004
Aw, Mom!
- There you go.

35:57.486 --> 35:59.954
Michael, do you wanna stay here?

36:02.658 --> 36:07.027
I mean, because if you wanna stay here
for a while longer...

36:07.196 --> 36:12.065
...I can find some time to
figure out a bedroom for you.

36:13.435 --> 36:15.130
I mean, because look at this.

36:15.304 --> 36:18.603
You have practically ruined
a $10,000 couch.

36:24.380 --> 36:26.439
Do you wanna stay here, Michael?

36:29.051 --> 36:31.542
I don't wanna go anyplace else.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.654
Well, all right, then.

36:41.563 --> 36:43.554
SJ, you better be off that Playbox.

36:43.732 --> 36:45.893
That wasn't two minutes.

36:46.535 --> 36:48.833
Good night, Mrs. Tuohy.

36:54.543 --> 36:57.979
I see on the admission that we're
Michael’s contact for medical emergencies.

36:58.147 --> 36:59.739
Sean wrote that in last week.

36:59.915 --> 37:03.009
We needed a contact number and
the ones listed weren't in service.

37:03.719 --> 37:05.914
I love that man.

37:06.989 --> 37:08.081
What's this?

37:09.258 --> 37:13.160
The state makes schools measure
for career aptitude in the eighth grade...

37:13.328 --> 37:16.388
- ...and this just came with his file.
- What's it say about Michael?

37:16.565 --> 37:19.329
Spatial relations, third percentile.

37:19.501 --> 37:22.766
Ability to learn, fifth percentile.

37:22.938 --> 37:27.432
It's funny though. He tested in
the 98th percentile in one category.

37:27.609 --> 37:30.476
- Which one?
- Protective instincts.

37:33.048 --> 37:37.451
So over here you have a desk,
chest of drawers...

37:37.619 --> 37:40.713
...you have a nightstand, a light,
an alarm.

37:40.889 --> 37:44.518
Sean says all pro athletes use futons
if they can’t find a bed big enough...

37:44.693 --> 37:47.560
...so I got you one of those.
Of course the frame was heinous.

37:47.729 --> 37:51.130
I was not about to let that in my house,
but I got you something nicer.

37:52.901 --> 37:56.064
- It's mine?
- Yes, sir.

37:57.139 --> 37:59.903
- What?
- Never had one before.

38:00.642 --> 38:02.405
What, a room to yourself?

38:03.145 --> 38:04.806
A bed.

38:14.189 --> 38:16.817
Well, you have one now.

38:48.524 --> 38:51.425
Okay. Define osmosis.

38:52.127 --> 38:54.391
I think I know that one.

38:55.097 --> 38:58.726
It's when water passes through
a barrier.

38:58.901 --> 39:01.392
That's basically right, Michael.
Very good.

39:09.177 --> 39:13.113
Name the combatants
in the Battle of Waterloo.

39:13.282 --> 39:16.012
I know that one. Um...

39:16.184 --> 39:17.947
- The little guy, Napoleon.
- Uh-huh.

39:18.120 --> 39:22.113
He was on one side
and a duke was on the other.

39:22.291 --> 39:23.781
Duke of Wellington.

39:23.959 --> 39:27.019
Yeah, and the Duke of Wellington,
he had Russians helping him.

39:27.195 --> 39:28.219
Prussians.

39:42.477 --> 39:47.210
Enough with the rugby shirts.
You look like a giant bumblebee.

39:49.551 --> 39:50.779
That Taco Bell.

39:50.953 --> 39:54.719
KFC catty-corner. And
the Long John Silver’s on the next block.

39:54.890 --> 39:55.914
You own all of them?

39:56.091 --> 39:58.821
- Yeah. We've got like hundreds.
- Eighty-five.

39:59.094 --> 40:01.289
Is that why Mr. Tuohy
don't have to go to work?

40:01.530 --> 40:05.489
Whoa, whoa! Hey! I'm working even
when I'm not working.

40:06.234 --> 40:09.328
- What?
- And you eat at all these places for free?

40:09.504 --> 40:11.472
All you want. It's awesome.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.575
What do y’all do with all
the leftover food from the restaurant?

40:14.743 --> 40:17.109
We have to throw some out,
what's already cooked.

40:17.279 --> 40:20.077
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I'd rather sell it.

40:20.248 --> 40:22.580
Seems like you could give it away
or something.

40:22.751 --> 40:26.551
- You should check into that, Daddy.
All right, I will, SJ.

40:26.722 --> 40:29.520
How come we're not eating
at one of your restaurants tonight?

40:29.691 --> 40:33.149
- Well, because tonight is a special occasion.
What?

40:33.695 --> 40:37.153
I talked to Coach Cotton. He said
Michael’s grades have improved enough...

40:37.332 --> 40:40.165
...that he can go out
for spring football in March.

40:40.335 --> 40:43.702
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, man! You're gonna crush some people!

40:51.046 --> 40:53.844
- Hey, guys, how we doing?
- Great, thank you.

40:54.716 --> 40:58.174
I've got a design book I need to get.
Why don't you check our reservation?

40:58.353 --> 41:00.253
They'll seat us right away.
Can't it wait?

41:00.422 --> 41:02.890
They might be closed by then.
Come on, SJ!

41:03.058 --> 41:04.582
I need some new magazines.

41:06.962 --> 41:08.862
Michael, come on. Come on.

41:20.008 --> 41:23.341
Collins? Collins?

41:23.812 --> 41:26.337
Collins, come on, your dad's
already PO'd. Let's go.

41:26.515 --> 41:27.709
Over here.

41:36.091 --> 41:40.790
You remember this one, Mom?
You read it to us like a thousand times.

41:41.196 --> 41:44.893
"He gnashed his terrible teeth
and he roared his terrible roar."

41:45.967 --> 41:47.867
I always liked this one.

41:48.036 --> 41:49.401
<i>Mm. Ferdinand.</i>

41:49.705 --> 41:51.536
Me too.

41:51.740 --> 41:55.232
Michael, your mama ever read
either one of those books to you?

41:58.480 --> 42:00.038
No?

42:00.749 --> 42:02.307
How cute!

42:02.484 --> 42:03.974
It was a good steak, huh?

42:04.152 --> 42:05.141
Thank you, Daddy.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.878
Thank you for a lovely dinner, Papa.

42:07.055 --> 42:08.420
Here we go.

42:43.625 --> 42:48.358
Michael. Who was that boy
you were talking to at the restaurant?

42:48.530 --> 42:50.498
Marcus.

42:51.166 --> 42:55.262
- Marcus, and he- He works there?
- Yeah.

42:56.371 --> 42:58.202
How do you know him?

42:59.741 --> 43:01.936
He's my brother.

43:08.483 --> 43:11.384
Well, we'd really- We'd really
like to meet him someday.

43:12.621 --> 43:14.919
Would that be okay with you?

43:15.390 --> 43:17.324
I don't know where he stays.

43:18.026 --> 43:20.517
When was the last time you saw him?

43:23.365 --> 43:24.923
When I was little, maybe.

43:29.571 --> 43:33.632
<i>"Once upon a time in Spain,
there was a little bull...</i>

43:33.809 --> 43:36.972
...and his name was Ferdinand.

43:37.345 --> 43:40.644
All the other little bulls he lived with
would run and jump...

43:40.816 --> 43:43.546
...and butt their heads together.

43:44.186 --> 43:46.711
But not Ferdinand.

43:47.889 --> 43:53.691
He liked to sit just quietly
and smell the flowers.

43:54.796 --> 43:58.596
He had a favorite spot out
in the pasture under a cork tree.

44:00.202 --> 44:02.329
<i>It was his favorite tree...</i>

44:02.504 --> 44:08.067
<i>...and he would sit in its shade
all day and smell the flowers. "</i>

44:08.243 --> 44:11.007
- Good night.
- Good night.

44:13.381 --> 44:15.975
- What?
- What?

44:16.251 --> 44:18.378
Why are you smiling?

44:18.653 --> 44:23.022
I don't know, I'm just happy.
Real happy.

44:23.191 --> 44:26.160
Does this happiness have anything
to do with Michael?

44:26.328 --> 44:27.955
No.

44:28.763 --> 44:31.664
It has everything to do with Michael.

44:33.034 --> 44:35.525
Mm. Mm.

44:35.770 --> 44:37.738
- Happy's good.
- Mm.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.367
You know what I think we should do?

44:40.542 --> 44:43.340
We should start a charity
for kids like Michael.

44:43.511 --> 44:45.945
- Okay.
- Maybe fund a program at Wingate.

44:46.114 --> 44:47.138
Sure.

44:47.315 --> 44:49.579
Lord knows that school
could use a little color.

44:49.751 --> 44:53.346
Poor Michael’s like a fly in the milk
in that place.

44:53.521 --> 44:55.421
Are you listening to me?

44:57.259 --> 45:01.889
- Hmm?
- I try to concentrate on one...

45:02.697 --> 45:04.358
...thing...

45:04.799 --> 45:06.460
...at a time.

45:06.635 --> 45:08.330
You knew I was a multitasker...

45:08.503 --> 45:09.868
...when you married me, right?

45:10.038 --> 45:14.099
- I sure did.
- Right. Okay, just checking.

45:17.913 --> 45:22.282
Okay, Tuohy family.
Big smiles, everyone.

45:23.084 --> 45:26.986
And one, two, three!

45:29.424 --> 45:30.448
Michael.

45:30.625 --> 45:32.752
Come on down here
and get in the next one.

45:32.961 --> 45:35.953
Come on. Come on. Come on down.

45:41.303 --> 45:44.363
Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put it on the Christmas card.

45:44.539 --> 45:48.839
Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.

45:49.010 --> 45:50.534
That's good.

45:51.313 --> 45:52.644
Really big smiles.

45:52.814 --> 45:55.476
Okay, one, two, three.

45:55.650 --> 45:57.447
- Say "Rebels!"
Rebels!

46:01.656 --> 46:04.181
<i>- a blitz off
the corner, quick pass over the middle.</i>

46:04.359 --> 46:08.625
<i>- The hot route was there. And that's...
I got it.</i>

46:09.297 --> 46:11.629
- Who's winning?
- Tennessee.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.462
- Ugh. Who they playing?
- Clemson.

46:14.636 --> 46:17.298
Your mama roots against Tennessee
no matter who they play?

46:17.472 --> 46:19.906
Uh- Yes, I do. With gusto.

46:20.075 --> 46:21.975
She can’t stand Tennessee.

46:22.143 --> 46:25.203
Collie-bell, I thought you were
going over to your boyfriend's.

46:25.380 --> 46:27.245
Thought I'd hang around here
for the day.

46:28.116 --> 46:29.549
Hmm.

46:29.784 --> 46:31.342
I like that.

46:31.519 --> 46:34.420
There's a couple messages on the machine.
I didn't check them.

46:34.589 --> 46:36.022
All right.

46:36.992 --> 46:40.393
<i>Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne, it's
your cousin Bobby. Happy New Year's.</i>

46:40.628 --> 46:43.495
- Listen, I've had about five cold ones...
- Of course you have.

46:43.665 --> 46:45.724
<i>...so I'm just gonna go ahead and ask:</i>

46:46.301 --> 46:49.634
Did y’all know there's a colored boy
in your Christmas card?

46:52.674 --> 46:54.403
What?

46:55.010 --> 46:58.002
You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.

46:58.179 --> 47:00.147
Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.

47:01.549 --> 47:04.143
Hey, does Michael get
the family discount at Taco Bell?

47:04.319 --> 47:07.846
Because if he does,
Sean's gonna lose a few stores.

47:08.023 --> 47:09.081
He's a good kid.

47:09.257 --> 47:12.192
Well, I say you make it official
and just adopt him.

47:13.962 --> 47:18.262
He's gonna be 18 in a few months. Doesn't
really make much sense to legally adopt.

47:21.436 --> 47:22.460
Leigh Anne.

47:22.937 --> 47:25.462
Is this some sort of white-guilt thing?

47:25.807 --> 47:28.105
What will your daddy say?

47:28.810 --> 47:32.109
Um... Before or after
he turns over in his grave?

47:32.280 --> 47:34.748
Daddy's been gone five years, Elaine.

47:34.916 --> 47:38.044
Make matters worse, you were
at the funeral. Remember?

47:38.219 --> 47:40.585
You wore Chanel
and that awful black hat.

47:40.755 --> 47:42.552
Look, here's the deal.

47:42.724 --> 47:45.955
I don't need y’all to approve
my choices, all right?

47:46.127 --> 47:50.291
But I do ask that you respect them. You
have no idea what this boy's been through.

47:50.465 --> 47:53.127
And if this is gonna become
some running diatribe...

47:53.301 --> 47:55.997
...I can find an overpriced salad
a lot closer to home.

47:58.006 --> 48:01.373
- Leigh Anne, I'm sorry. We didn't intend to-
- No, we didn't, really.

48:01.543 --> 48:04.774
I think what you're doing is so great.

48:04.946 --> 48:07.710
To open up your home to him?

48:08.083 --> 48:10.347
Honey, you're changing that boy's life.

48:11.186 --> 48:12.778
No.

48:13.321 --> 48:14.913
He's changing mine.

48:16.491 --> 48:18.823
And that’s awesome for you,
but what about Collins?

48:20.662 --> 48:22.960
- What about Collins?
Aren't you worried?

48:23.131 --> 48:24.826
I mean, even just a little?

48:24.999 --> 48:29.436
He's a boy, a large, black boy,
sleeping under the same roof.

48:32.140 --> 48:33.437
Shame on you.

48:38.646 --> 48:39.977
I've got this.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.880
<i>Be honest with me, okay?</i>

48:45.787 --> 48:49.450
Does Michael being here
make you uncomfortable?

48:50.091 --> 48:53.527
They're stupid kids.
Who cares what they say?

48:53.695 --> 48:56.858
- What kids?
- At school.

48:57.365 --> 48:58.696
They're juvenile.

48:58.867 --> 49:00.892
And what do the juvenile kids say?

49:01.970 --> 49:04.200
It's really not worth repeating.

49:05.340 --> 49:07.240
And don't worry about SJ.

49:07.542 --> 49:11.740
He likes all the attention. He introduces
Michael as his big brother.

49:16.451 --> 49:17.816
And what about you?

49:18.219 --> 49:20.187
It's fine.

49:21.990 --> 49:25.084
I mean, you can’t just throw him
out on the street.

49:25.260 --> 49:27.421
I could make other arrangements.

49:31.432 --> 49:33.992
Hi, Mike.
- Hi. Need a push?

49:34.169 --> 49:35.796
Yes.

49:40.875 --> 49:43.400
Oh.
Higher, Mike, higher!

49:47.215 --> 49:49.206
Higher!

49:53.421 --> 49:55.582
Higher!

49:59.260 --> 50:02.388
Don't look down, don't look down. Ah!

50:35.630 --> 50:38.599
- Where are you going?
- Collins?

50:50.211 --> 50:52.509
Quit looking at me like that.

50:52.680 --> 50:55.615
I mean, we study together at home.

51:12.333 --> 51:16.793
You know how much those things weigh?
This kid's gonna make us all famous.

51:18.506 --> 51:22.738
Easy, Bert, man. It's only the spring.
He hasn't even had his first practice yet.

51:22.910 --> 51:24.935
No, he's a player.

51:25.380 --> 51:26.870
Break!

51:27.348 --> 51:29.316
Ready.
Break!

51:29.917 --> 51:33.580
Get down, son.
Get down in your stance. In your stance!

51:33.855 --> 51:34.879
Go!

51:36.090 --> 51:39.856
Shuck him, shuck him! Ah, ah-

51:40.928 --> 51:44.022
Mike, son, you-
You fought off the block...

51:44.198 --> 51:46.530
...but then you wanna shuck
the blocker.

51:46.701 --> 51:49.670
All right? Shuck him. All right, let's go.

51:50.471 --> 51:52.200
Huddle up.

51:52.373 --> 51:54.102
Papa.

51:55.476 --> 51:56.875
How's he doing?

51:57.045 --> 51:58.569
Hasn't quite gotten the hang of it yet.

52:06.721 --> 52:07.813
Mike, son.

52:07.989 --> 52:10.082
Shuck the blocker, don't tote him!

52:10.258 --> 52:12.192
Set, go!

52:13.594 --> 52:17.223
No, no, no! No, no, no!

52:17.965 --> 52:19.523
Set, go!

52:28.242 --> 52:30.039
Balloons! They're balloons!

52:30.678 --> 52:33.613
Guys, quit looking at the balloons.
Everybody!

52:33.781 --> 52:36.648
Most kids from bad situations
can’t wait to be violent...

52:36.818 --> 52:38.445
...and that comes out on the field.

52:38.619 --> 52:41.782
But this kid, he acts like
he doesn't wanna hit anyone.

52:41.956 --> 52:43.856
He's Ferdinand the Bull.

52:44.025 --> 52:45.754
What?
- Nothing.

52:47.261 --> 52:51.823
I thought he was gonna be a player. I can’t
believe I used up all my chips to get him in.

52:51.999 --> 52:54.160
I thought you said
it was your Christian duty.

52:55.870 --> 52:58.566
Look, Bert, he's never even played before.

52:59.640 --> 53:02.939
Yeah, and he won't this fall if he
doesn't improve a lot before then.

53:03.277 --> 53:05.142
Who died and made him Bear Bryant?

53:06.848 --> 53:08.213
Unbelievable.

53:09.350 --> 53:11.477
Oh, God bless me.

53:11.652 --> 53:13.313
This is your summer workout sheet.

53:13.488 --> 53:15.718
Now, first it says to warm up
and get loose.

53:16.657 --> 53:18.420
Well, go ahead, get loose.

53:21.295 --> 53:22.853
Are you loose?

53:23.231 --> 53:26.997
Okay. Next, it's five 100-yard runs
to stretch out your legs.

53:27.168 --> 53:29.432
- Can we just go home and play video games?
- Look!

53:29.604 --> 53:32.767
Everybody at Wingate is expecting you
to be a star football player.

53:32.940 --> 53:34.567
Don't wanna let them down,
do you?

53:34.742 --> 53:36.676
- I don't know.
- What about Dad and Mom?

53:36.844 --> 53:39.506
Because, you see, in our family,
everyone's an athlete.

53:39.680 --> 53:43.741
Dad was a basketball star.
Collins plays volleyball and runs track.

53:43.918 --> 53:46.250
And me, well, as you know, I do it all.

53:46.421 --> 53:48.912
And Mom- Well, Mom was a cheerleader...

53:49.090 --> 53:52.821
...which doesn't exactly count,
but don't tell her I said that. Okay?

53:52.994 --> 53:55.155
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:56.764 --> 53:59.824
- Yeah. Fifty.
Uhn.

54:00.001 --> 54:01.935
Fifty-one.

54:02.270 --> 54:05.603
Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

54:05.807 --> 54:08.970
Come on, you can get him.
Go, go, go! Come on!

54:09.143 --> 54:10.633
Five seconds left in the game!

54:12.513 --> 54:13.980
This way!

54:14.148 --> 54:15.308
This way!

54:15.483 --> 54:19.920
High knees, high knees, high knees!
Speed kills, baby! Run like the wind!

54:21.289 --> 54:22.916
Go, Michael, go!

54:23.124 --> 54:24.955
Ninety-eight.

54:25.359 --> 54:26.383
Ninety-nine.

54:28.229 --> 54:29.526
One hundred.

54:29.697 --> 54:32.393
Move your feet, move your feet!
Come on, come on! Go!

54:32.567 --> 54:33.898
- There you go.
- Ahh!

54:34.068 --> 54:36.468
You gotta get the tackle,
come on, come on, come on!

54:37.205 --> 54:38.467
Come on, Michael.

55:03.097 --> 55:04.121
Mrs. Tuohy?

55:04.298 --> 55:07.734
I hear "Mrs. Tuohy," I look over
my shoulder for my mother-in-law.

55:07.902 --> 55:11.030
Call me Leigh Anne or Mama
or almost anything else.

55:14.175 --> 55:17.167
- Can you help me get something?
- What?

55:19.614 --> 55:20.842
Driver's license.

55:22.750 --> 55:26.083
Why do you need a driver's license
when you don't even have a car?

55:33.528 --> 55:36.053
Michael, why do you want
a driver's license?

55:36.764 --> 55:39.631
It's something to carry
with my name on it.

55:46.874 --> 55:49.399
There's no one by the name of
Michael Oher in the system.

55:49.577 --> 55:51.977
Another last name, perhaps?

55:54.215 --> 55:56.911
Look, I will sign something
that says he lives with us.

55:57.084 --> 56:00.144
We'll pay for all of the insurance.
Whatever it takes. Okay?

56:01.122 --> 56:02.316
What's it gonna take?

56:02.490 --> 56:05.220
You wanna do what?
- You heard me.

56:05.393 --> 56:08.658
- Shouldn’t we at least talk about this?
- What do you think we're doing?

56:08.829 --> 56:10.922
And don't act like
I'm going behind your back.

56:11.098 --> 56:14.625
I know you put us down as
Michael’s medical contact at school.

56:14.802 --> 56:17.737
There is a huge difference
between paying for a broken arm...

56:17.905 --> 56:21.602
...and being legally responsible for
someone. I mean, a kid we barely know.

56:21.776 --> 56:25.075
That's another thing. We need to
find out more about his past.

56:25.246 --> 56:29.307
He won't talk about it. He's like an onion.
You have to peel him back a layer at a time.

56:29.483 --> 56:31.747
Not if you use a knife.

56:32.453 --> 56:35.616
What if we took him to a child
psychologist or something?

56:35.790 --> 56:38.452
- Do you really expect Big Mike to-?
- Michael.

56:38.626 --> 56:40.560
Do you expect Michael
to lie on a couch...

56:40.728 --> 56:43.253
...and talk about his childhood
like he's Woody Allen?

56:43.431 --> 56:46.093
I mean, Michael’s gift
is his ability to forget.

56:46.267 --> 56:50.226
He's mad at no one and he really
doesn't care what happened in the past.

56:50.871 --> 56:51.997
You're right.

56:52.707 --> 56:55.972
Excuse me? "You're right"?

56:56.143 --> 56:58.611
How'd those words taste
coming out of your mouth?

56:58.779 --> 57:00.212
Like vinegar.

57:09.056 --> 57:11.786
Well, at least promise me
you'll think about it.

57:11.959 --> 57:13.756
All right.

57:14.462 --> 57:17.829
"All right, you’ll think about it,"
or, "All right, we should do it"?

57:17.999 --> 57:20.229
Is there a difference?

57:22.436 --> 57:27.703
Just tell Gerald to hold on to the chiffonier
and I will be by there after a while.

57:28.142 --> 57:31.976
You know- I gotta call you back. Bye.

57:33.681 --> 57:35.672
Excuse me.

57:36.884 --> 57:38.476
I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.

57:38.653 --> 57:42.316
Let me tell you something. We have been
sitting around here for over an hour...

57:42.490 --> 57:46.722
...and when I look around and all I see are
people shooting the bull and drinking coffee.

57:46.894 --> 57:48.088
Who runs this place?

57:51.365 --> 57:53.925
I'd have it in shape in two days,
I can tell you that.

57:54.101 --> 57:57.161
- I bet you would. How can I help you?
- Oh, he was first.

57:57.338 --> 58:00.637
- No, you go ahead. I think I wanna hear this.
- Me too.

58:00.808 --> 58:02.537
I do not appreciate the attitude.

58:02.710 --> 58:05.508
Ma'am, now, you can tell me
what you want...

58:05.680 --> 58:07.875
...or I can make sure
you wait here all day.

58:08.049 --> 58:09.539
Now, how can I help you?

58:09.917 --> 58:11.817
I would like to become a legal guardian.

58:12.086 --> 58:14.281
Lord help that child.

58:17.858 --> 58:22.192
There's very little on Michael.
Most of his files have been lost.

58:22.363 --> 58:25.355
- Well, what is in there?
- A few case notes.

58:25.900 --> 58:30.360
This one describes an incident where
officers forcibly removed Michael...

58:30.538 --> 58:33.268
...from Denise Oher's care
when Michael was 7.

58:33.441 --> 58:36.239
Quite a scene evidently.
They had to split up the kids.

58:36.410 --> 58:39.937
- And it's far from the worst.
- Where is she? His mother?

58:40.114 --> 58:44.414
I don't know. If you find her, we got
a heap more files we could add to.

58:45.453 --> 58:47.045
Well, how many kids does she have?

58:47.221 --> 58:50.384
Least a dozen, probably. If not more.

58:50.558 --> 58:54.221
With her drug-arrest record, my guess
would be, she can’t even remember.

58:54.395 --> 58:56.090
Can I see that?

59:00.568 --> 59:03.128
So we would need her permission,
right?

59:03.304 --> 59:07.968
No. Michael is a ward of the state.
Just apply and get a judge to sign off on it.

59:10.745 --> 59:14.841
So you would just give him away
without even telling his mother?

59:29.029 --> 59:31.293
Check out this piece right here.

59:31.465 --> 59:33.126
Yeah.
Damn, girl.

59:38.472 --> 59:39.461
<i>Miss Oher?</i>

59:43.277 --> 59:46.303
Hi. Miss- Miss Oher?

59:48.048 --> 59:51.279
- You from the state?
- No.

59:51.485 --> 59:54.511
My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy,
and your son...

59:54.855 --> 59:57.824
...Michael, lives with me...

59:58.492 --> 01:00:00.585
...and my family.

01:00:06.967 --> 01:00:09.993
How is my boy? How's Big Mike?

01:00:10.171 --> 01:00:13.265
He's fine. He's doing real well.

01:00:14.008 --> 01:00:16.499
We might have some wine in the kitchen,
if you...

01:00:16.677 --> 01:00:18.668
Oh, no, no. That's real kind.

01:00:19.046 --> 01:00:20.877
When did you last see Michael?

01:00:22.449 --> 01:00:24.417
I don't know.

01:00:24.585 --> 01:00:28.749
How many-? How many foster kids
you got living with you?

01:00:28.923 --> 01:00:33.019
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.
We're just helping him out.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.918
State don't pay you nothing?

01:00:35.229 --> 01:00:37.163
No, no.

01:00:37.331 --> 01:00:40.767
And you feed him and
you buy him clothes too?

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:43.904
Well, when we can find them
in his size.

01:00:47.107 --> 01:00:49.405
You are a fine Christian lady.

01:00:49.777 --> 01:00:52.109
Well, I try to be.

01:00:53.414 --> 01:00:55.814
This all real nice, what you're doing...

01:00:55.983 --> 01:00:59.441
...but don't be surprised if one day
you wake up and he gone.

01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:01.883
What do you mean?

01:01:02.056 --> 01:01:06.686
He's a runner. That's what the state
called him after they took him from me.

01:01:09.597 --> 01:01:12.259
Every foster home they sent him to...

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.831
...he'd slip out the window at night
and come looking for me.

01:01:16.003 --> 01:01:21.270
No matter where I was, that boy
would come find me, take care of me.

01:01:23.143 --> 01:01:26.806
I've had some health problems.

01:01:27.948 --> 01:01:32.044
Miss Oher, was Michael born
under a different name?

01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:36.880
Proctor. That was his daddy's last name.

01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:38.722
Where is he?

01:01:38.893 --> 01:01:42.727
- I ain't seen him since he left.
- And when was that?

01:01:42.897 --> 01:01:44.956
Week after Mike was born.

01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:47.992
Do you happen to have
his birth certificate?

01:01:56.225 --> 01:01:59.558
It's all right. I'll figure it out.

01:02:13.842 --> 01:02:16.868
Mrs. Oher, you’ll always be
Michael’s mama.

01:02:20.883 --> 01:02:22.316
Would you like to see him?

01:02:22.484 --> 01:02:26.386
No. Not this way.

01:02:28.657 --> 01:02:30.921
It's Williams.

01:02:32.427 --> 01:02:35.089
His last name's Williams.

01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:39.964
Couldn’t even remember
who the boy's father is.

01:03:08.297 --> 01:03:12.358
I checked out the new Madden. The colors
are better, graphics brighter. It's awesome.

01:03:12.534 --> 01:03:15.128
Michael, we have something
we'd like to ask you.

01:03:15.804 --> 01:03:20.241
- What?
- Well, Leigh Anne and I, we-

01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:24.707
Well, we'd like to become
your legal guardians.

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.138
What's that mean?

01:03:26.582 --> 01:03:29.574
What it means is,
is that we wanna know...

01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:33.050
...if you would like to
become part of this family.

01:03:41.863 --> 01:03:43.728
Kind of thought I already was.

01:03:52.574 --> 01:03:55.168
Well, all right, then.

01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:04.614
Right here.

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:11.386
You got a couple steps.
Better watch that big foot.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:12.788
One more.

01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:15.259
One more. There you go.

01:04:16.331 --> 01:04:18.731
All right. Take off the blindfold.

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:27.398
Well? That's the one you wanted,
isn't it? Heh.

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:31.012
Here. Here you go, go ahead.
Take it for a ride. Go on.

01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:34.148
Can I go too?
- Yeah, but, Michael? Be careful.

01:04:34.316 --> 01:04:36.307
Shotgun!

01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:37.952
Whoo-hoo!

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:42.682
- He wanted a truck?
- Well, Michael thinks he's a redneck.

01:04:42.858 --> 01:04:44.792
Come on, Michael!

01:04:45.394 --> 01:04:49.194
Okay. See, you're the ketchup,
here at left tackle on the weak side.

01:04:49.364 --> 01:04:52.299
The first play is simple. Gap.

01:04:54.336 --> 01:04:58.329
Now, see, this just means that you're
going to block whoever's in front of you...

01:04:58.507 --> 01:05:01.704
...or on your inside shoulder, if
you're not covered by a defender.

01:05:01.877 --> 01:05:05.369
Now, I'll be the running back, and you
show me what you're supposed to do.

01:05:05.714 --> 01:05:07.113
Ready? Hike!

01:05:07.616 --> 01:05:11.484
You'll block him. He'll hit him.
Quarterback'll hand it off.

01:05:11.653 --> 01:05:13.518
He gets the ball, and he takes off!

01:05:13.689 --> 01:05:16.283
Open lane to the end zone.
All there is to it.

01:05:16.458 --> 01:05:17.720
What's going on here?

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:20.221
Blended spice just scored.

01:05:20.395 --> 01:05:23.387
We were going through the playbook.
Michael got moved to offense.

01:05:23.565 --> 01:05:26.898
When you're done, put the players
back in the spice cabinet. Thank you.

01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:28.536
No problem.

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:32.601
Actually, Mom, we were
kind of waiting for you.

01:05:32.774 --> 01:05:34.708
You see,
the new Madden game came out...

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:37.174
...and me and Michael
were wanting to go get it.

01:05:37.345 --> 01:05:40.974
- I can’t, I've got a meeting in 10 minutes.
- But he can drive.

01:05:41.216 --> 01:05:42.979
He can drive us.

01:05:45.787 --> 01:05:47.482
Oh, yeah, that’s what I'm talking about.

01:05:47.656 --> 01:05:50.124
What you know about this?
I know a lot about this.

01:05:50.292 --> 01:05:52.385
- Show me something then.
- I'll show you something.

01:05:52.561 --> 01:05:54.620
- I'll start it. Follow my lead.
- All right.

01:05:54.796 --> 01:05:55.922
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:05:56.098 --> 01:05:57.156
<i>Next day's function</i>

01:05:57.332 --> 01:05:58.697
<i>High-class luncheon</i>

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:00.357
<i>- Food is served
- And you're stone-cold munchin'</i>

01:06:00.535 --> 01:06:02.366
<i>- Music comes on
- People start to dance</i>

01:06:02.537 --> 01:06:04.528
<i>- But then you ate so much
- You nearly split your pants</i>

01:06:04.706 --> 01:06:06.537
<i>- A girl starts walkin'
- Guy starts gawkin'</i>

01:06:06.708 --> 01:06:08.300
<i>- Sits down next to you
- Starts talkin'</i>

01:06:08.477 --> 01:06:10.741
<i>- Says she wanna dance
- 'Cause she likes the groove</i>

01:06:10.912 --> 01:06:13.107
<i>- So come on, fatso
- And just bust a move</i>

01:06:13.281 --> 01:06:17.217
<i>If you want it
You got it</i>

01:06:17.385 --> 01:06:21.185
<i>You want it
Baby, you got it</i>

01:06:21.356 --> 01:06:25.349
<i>You want it
You got it</i>

01:06:25.527 --> 01:06:29.054
<i>You want it
Baby, you got it</i>

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:34.899
This is not a $40,000 Oushak, Omid.

01:06:36.271 --> 01:06:37.363
You're crazy, Leigh Anne.

01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:40.770
The borders are different widths.
They've been altered.

01:06:40.942 --> 01:06:44.776
We'll give you 17, tops, all right? Hello.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, you can’t get through.

01:06:50.852 --> 01:06:53.252
Those are my kids. Those are my kids.

01:06:55.724 --> 01:06:57.988
- Oh, my God.
Please, God, let him be okay.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.185
Where are they?!
I'm so sorry!

01:07:00.362 --> 01:07:04.458
- Michael, are you okay?
- I'm fine! SJ! Go help SJ!

01:07:05.133 --> 01:07:07.658
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

01:07:08.136 --> 01:07:09.797
How are his vitals?

01:07:09.971 --> 01:07:11.529
Excuse me, ma'am.
- That's my son.

01:07:11.706 --> 01:07:13.970
SJ. SJ, baby.

01:07:14.142 --> 01:07:15.769
- Mama?
- Yes, baby?

01:07:15.944 --> 01:07:18.310
Do you think the blood'll
come out of my shirt?

01:07:19.815 --> 01:07:23.148
Yes, I think the blood
will come out of your shirt.

01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:25.081
An air bag deploys at 200 miles an hour.

01:07:25.253 --> 01:07:27.380
Your son is too small
to be in the front seat.

01:07:27.556 --> 01:07:29.148
But he is okay, right?

01:07:29.324 --> 01:07:33.124
Busted lip, bruised face. Usually when
someone his size gets hit with a air bag...

01:07:33.295 --> 01:07:35.820
...it's a fractured face, broken neck,
maybe worse.

01:07:35.997 --> 01:07:39.797
It's like the air bag was coming for him
and changed direction.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:42.129
It's probably defective or something...

01:07:42.304 --> 01:07:44.636
...but your son's very, very lucky.

01:07:44.806 --> 01:07:48.173
No, I did. I called the insurance,
it's fine. It's fine.

01:07:48.343 --> 01:07:50.277
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go. Bye.

01:07:54.115 --> 01:07:56.276
SJ's fine.

01:07:57.118 --> 01:08:01.851
He is. He's actually enjoying all
the attention he's getting back there.

01:08:03.091 --> 01:08:07.255
Hey, Michael, could’ve happened to
anyone, all right? It's not your fault.

01:08:08.263 --> 01:08:10.197
Honey, look at me.

01:08:16.037 --> 01:08:17.970
Michael, what happened to your arm?

01:08:19.608 --> 01:08:21.508
I stopped it.

01:08:29.684 --> 01:08:30.707
Wide right!
Ready.

01:08:30.886 --> 01:08:34.822
Let's go.
We're going right, right, right!

01:08:37.658 --> 01:08:41.425
- Roll three, roll three.
Ready, set, go!

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:51.837
Oher! You got 100 pounds on Collis and
you can’t keep him out of our backfield?

01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:54.669
Hold your block until
the whistle blows. Hold it!

01:08:54.843 --> 01:08:56.674
All right, let's go!

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:59.006
What's with the camera?

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:02.638
Michael always does better when
he sees what he's supposed to be doing.

01:09:03.618 --> 01:09:05.551
Set, go!

01:09:08.857 --> 01:09:12.452
- Holding. Left tackle.
Michael! Come on.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.389
Oher.

01:09:14.962 --> 01:09:16.395
Come here, son.

01:09:16.798 --> 01:09:21.131
If you're gonna hold him, hold him
inside here, between the tits. You got it?

01:09:21.303 --> 01:09:22.736
Will you look at me, son?

01:09:22.904 --> 01:09:26.897
If you grab him outside here like this or
with that horse-collar thing you just did...

01:09:27.075 --> 01:09:29.975
...you're gonna get flagged and
I'm gonna be pissed, you hear?

01:09:30.145 --> 01:09:31.874
All right, let's go!

01:09:32.981 --> 01:09:34.971
Baby, watch my stuff, all right?

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:37.714
Okay.

01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:41.718
Well, at least he'll look good
coming off the bus.

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:45.451
They'll be terrified till they realize
he's a marshmallow.

01:09:47.696 --> 01:09:50.859
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

01:09:52.133 --> 01:09:53.225
Give me a minute, Bert.

01:09:54.602 --> 01:09:58.163
- We're in the middle of a practice.
- You can thank me later.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.230
Come here.

01:10:00.408 --> 01:10:04.435
Michael. Remember when we first met
and we went to that horrible part of town...

01:10:04.612 --> 01:10:06.341
...to buy you those dreadful clothes?

01:10:06.514 --> 01:10:09.506
I was a little scared. You told me
not to worry, you had my back.

01:10:09.684 --> 01:10:11.151
- You remember that?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:10:11.319 --> 01:10:15.346
And if anyone tried to get to me,
you would’ve stopped them, right?

01:10:15.523 --> 01:10:20.119
And when you and SJ were in that car
wreck, what did you do to the air bag?

01:10:20.295 --> 01:10:24.493
- Stopped it.
- You stopped it. You stopped it.

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:29.626
This team is your family, Michael. You have
to protect them from those guys, okay?

01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:30.793
Listen.

01:10:32.574 --> 01:10:37.102
Okay. Tony here is your quarterback,
all right? You protect his blind side.

01:10:37.278 --> 01:10:40.179
When you look at him, you think of me,
how you have my back...

01:10:40.348 --> 01:10:42.646
...how you have his. Okay?

01:10:42.817 --> 01:10:44.808
All right, Tony, go back.

01:10:46.087 --> 01:10:47.679
All right.

01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:51.289
Oompa-Loompa here is your tailback.
When you look at him, think of SJ...

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:54.951
...and how you'd never let anyone or
anything hurt him. You understand me?

01:10:55.397 --> 01:10:57.661
All right. Go back.

01:10:57.899 --> 01:11:00.527
- Got it?
- What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?

01:11:00.702 --> 01:11:04.729
Fine, they can be on the team too.
Are you gonna protect the family, Michael?

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.499
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good boy.

01:11:07.675 --> 01:11:09.472
Now go have some fun.

01:11:14.849 --> 01:11:18.012
Yelling at him doesn't work, Bert.
He doesn't trust men.

01:11:18.186 --> 01:11:22.179
In his experience, they pretend
to care about you till they disappear.

01:11:28.797 --> 01:11:30.025
Wanna run a play?

01:11:33.301 --> 01:11:35.326
SJ, you're gonna wanna get this.

01:11:35.703 --> 01:11:37.500
Okay.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.974
Come on, Michael.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.541
Ready!

01:11:47.715 --> 01:11:48.943
Set, go!

01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:57.116
- Yeah.
- All right, Michael, come on.

01:12:01.362 --> 01:12:02.886
Set, go!

01:12:06.401 --> 01:12:09.893
- Whoo! Yes! Michael!
All right, way to go, O, way to go!

01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.976
Ready! Set, go!

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.804
Yes!

01:12:24.052 --> 01:12:25.246
That a boy.

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:28.617
You all right?
Hey, get over here. Let's go.

01:12:34.095 --> 01:12:36.063
Come on, son!

01:12:36.364 --> 01:12:39.891
Okay. What'd you say to him?

01:12:40.068 --> 01:12:42.195
You should get to know your players,
Bert.

01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:46.272
He tested 98 percent
in protective instincts.

01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.510
I said you could thank me later.

01:12:51.846 --> 01:12:53.973
It's later, Bert.

01:12:58.553 --> 01:13:01.579
<i>Milford! Milford! Milford!</i>

01:13:05.627 --> 01:13:07.993
So much for home-field advantage.

01:13:08.163 --> 01:13:10.654
You ever see so many rednecks
in one place?

01:13:10.832 --> 01:13:13.392
NASCAR. Not even close.

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:18.933
Crusaders! Get ready for 48 minutes
of hell!

01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:20.597
Look at that fat ass.

01:13:22.911 --> 01:13:24.208
Pay them back on the field.

01:13:24.379 --> 01:13:26.472
Coming through. Hold on.
Listen up! Listen up!

01:13:26.648 --> 01:13:30.175
Don't let them get inside your head now.
Keep your composure! You ready?

01:13:30.351 --> 01:13:32.785
Yeah!
- All right, let's go, Crusaders!

01:13:34.722 --> 01:13:36.883
Go, Wingate!
- Let's go, Crusaders!

01:13:37.058 --> 01:13:38.582
Michael!

01:13:39.527 --> 01:13:42.985
Damn, that ain't fair. They got
a big old black bear playing for them.

01:13:43.398 --> 01:13:46.162
- What is this, a circus?
- Right.

01:13:46.467 --> 01:13:50.870
Eyes forward, SJ. Sticks and stones.
Sticks and stones. Come on!

01:14:04.719 --> 01:14:06.186
Go!

01:14:10.525 --> 01:14:13.358
- All right, all right. Good start.
- Nice.

01:14:15.129 --> 01:14:16.721
Ready.
Break!

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:20.693
- Let's go, O! Let's go!
Whoo!

01:14:21.236 --> 01:14:24.399
Hey, you guys, look at this big buck
we got right here! Whoo!

01:14:24.739 --> 01:14:27.264
Coming after you! Coming after you!

01:14:27.609 --> 01:14:29.839
You're all mine. All mine.

01:14:30.011 --> 01:14:32.775
Ready, set, go!

01:14:37.785 --> 01:14:39.082
Yeah!

01:14:39.254 --> 01:14:41.654
Don't let him rip through, Oher!
Come on, son.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:44.051
Yeah! That's right, boy!

01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:47.160
- All night long, fat ass! All night long!
Good job.

01:14:47.328 --> 01:14:51.788
I got you, boy! All night long.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:14:51.966 --> 01:14:53.126
Now that’s my boy.

01:14:53.568 --> 01:14:54.660
It's all right, Michael.

01:14:54.836 --> 01:14:56.531
- It's all right. Come on.
- Let's go.

01:14:56.704 --> 01:14:58.262
Shake it off. Come on.

01:15:01.175 --> 01:15:04.941
Here we go. Round two, baby, round two.

01:15:07.115 --> 01:15:08.673
Ready!

01:15:09.117 --> 01:15:10.607
- Set!
- Switch! Switch!

01:15:10.785 --> 01:15:13.481
Got it! Got it!
Go!

01:15:17.258 --> 01:15:19.988
Whoo! Yeah!

01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:24.429
Oher, don't let him get the inside gap
on you. Come on. Use your head!

01:15:24.599 --> 01:15:27.966
- What is Bert doing? Nothing.
Break!

01:15:28.469 --> 01:15:30.403
Break!
- Hey, fat boy.

01:15:30.571 --> 01:15:34.302
We're not done yet. All game long,
boy. All game long!

01:15:34.475 --> 01:15:35.772
Slot right, slot right.

01:15:36.244 --> 01:15:38.235
Ready, set, go!

01:15:40.181 --> 01:15:41.910
Pass, pass, pass!

01:15:43.284 --> 01:15:44.808
Stop this- Oh!

01:15:44.986 --> 01:15:46.044
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.744
Yeah.

01:15:48.523 --> 01:15:50.150
Why another pass, Bert?

01:15:50.325 --> 01:15:52.259
Hey, where you going, fat boy?

01:15:52.427 --> 01:15:56.796
You better stay off my field. You are
not welcome here! This is my field!

01:15:56.964 --> 01:16:00.991
- Sixty-six, get back to your own bench!
- Bert! Be quiet. Bert!

01:16:10.278 --> 01:16:11.302
Hello?

01:16:11.479 --> 01:16:15.142
Enough with the trick plays, Bert.
Run the dang ball.

01:16:16.884 --> 01:16:19.318
You heard me. Run the dang ball. Run it!

01:16:21.222 --> 01:16:23.019
Wait, did he just hang up the phone?

01:16:23.191 --> 01:16:25.853
- No, I think he lost service.
- He did not lose service.

01:16:26.027 --> 01:16:28.655
- Whoo!
Oh, that’s my boy, Jimmy!

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:32.391
Number 66! Kicking that blue gum's ass.

01:16:34.402 --> 01:16:36.700
Hey. Crotch-mouth.

01:16:36.871 --> 01:16:40.534
Yeah, you. Zip it or I'll come
up there and zip it for you.

01:16:43.845 --> 01:16:45.039
Sticks and stones?

01:16:45.213 --> 01:16:47.408
You know what, SJ, just turn forward.

01:16:47.582 --> 01:16:51.143
Just pick up the camera and
keep shooting. Come on.

01:16:51.919 --> 01:16:53.386
Push it, push it, push it!

01:16:54.389 --> 01:16:56.050
And go!

01:16:59.894 --> 01:17:01.327
Squeeze in!

01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.391
Hah.

01:17:06.567 --> 01:17:09.001
It's all right. All right, all right,
we can come back from that.

01:17:11.105 --> 01:17:13.164
Set, go!

01:17:26.287 --> 01:17:27.311
Break!

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:29.217
And go!

01:17:33.227 --> 01:17:34.524
Come on!

01:17:34.695 --> 01:17:36.663
Get him!
- He's gone. He's gone.

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:44.431
- He's gotta shut that hole off.
- No.

01:17:46.741 --> 01:17:51.610
Unbelievable. Three plays. Three
plays. What were we in, 4-3? Come on!

01:17:53.314 --> 01:17:55.145
Ready.
Break!

01:17:55.316 --> 01:17:58.285
Whoo! That's right, biggie, me and you.

01:17:58.453 --> 01:18:01.718
Me and you, biggie, one more time.
Here we go.

01:18:03.324 --> 01:18:04.951
Ready!

01:18:06.027 --> 01:18:07.517
Set! Go!

01:18:16.471 --> 01:18:20.305
All right, Bobby, cut back. Son,
you gotta cut back, you gotta cut back.

01:18:20.475 --> 01:18:23.535
- Come on. Let's go. Back to huddle.
- You fat, black piece of crap.

01:18:23.711 --> 01:18:27.511
Hey! Hey! Ref, are you gonna
do something about this?

01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:30.674
He just kicked my boy in the head
and he cussed him!

01:18:30.852 --> 01:18:32.683
Thank you.

01:18:32.854 --> 01:18:35.846
Unsportsmanlike conduct, Wingate.
Fifteen yards.

01:18:36.023 --> 01:18:38.150
- What?
- You shut up, you get another 15.

01:18:42.330 --> 01:18:45.788
This young man plays for my team.
My team!

01:18:45.967 --> 01:18:50.028
And I will defend him
like he's my own son against you...

01:18:50.204 --> 01:18:54.265
...or any other redneck son of a bitch!

01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:57.707
Don't worry, coach. I got your back.

01:19:07.388 --> 01:19:09.083
Come here, son, come here.

01:19:09.924 --> 01:19:12.051
- Try Gap.
- Gap?

01:19:12.226 --> 01:19:13.250
Gap.

01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:17.656
All right. Gun rip, 47 Gap.
On one, on one. Ready.

01:19:17.832 --> 01:19:19.356
Break!

01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:27.004
Your coach ain't here
to protect you now, is he?

01:19:34.048 --> 01:19:36.107
Ready!

01:19:36.951 --> 01:19:38.714
<i>This team is your family, Michael.</i>

01:19:38.886 --> 01:19:40.444
Set!

01:19:45.126 --> 01:19:46.150
Go!

01:19:52.266 --> 01:19:54.257
Cut back, cut back. Block him, Oher.

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:56.227
He's got a hole! He's got a hole!

01:20:00.675 --> 01:20:02.540
- Get him, Michael.
- SJ!

01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:05.178
Get him, Michael. Come on, go!
Run, Michael!

01:20:07.682 --> 01:20:09.047
Go, go, go!

01:20:09.216 --> 01:20:11.047
- Go, Mike!
- Go, Michael!

01:20:11.218 --> 01:20:12.617
Yeah, touchdown!

01:20:12.787 --> 01:20:14.755
Hey! Hey! Touchdown!

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:18.190
Ooh.

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:24.197
<i>Yo! Deliverance!</i>

01:20:24.365 --> 01:20:27.801
You see number 74?
Well, that’s my son.

01:20:29.704 --> 01:20:31.194
Way to go, bro! Ha-ha-ha.

01:20:31.372 --> 01:20:33.237
Okay, here's what we got.
Dead ball foul.

01:20:33.407 --> 01:20:36.035
- Now what? Was he holding?
- No.

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:39.873
- Did he hit after the whistle?
- I don't believe so.

01:20:40.047 --> 01:20:42.015
Then what was the flag for?

01:20:42.183 --> 01:20:45.641
I don't know. Excessive blocking.

01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:47.011
You're kidding me.

01:20:50.925 --> 01:20:54.019
Sorry, coach. I stopped
when I heard the whistle.

01:20:54.195 --> 01:20:55.685
Where were you taking him, Mike?

01:20:55.863 --> 01:20:59.560
To the bus. It was time for him
to go home.

01:21:01.569 --> 01:21:03.662
Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!

01:21:03.838 --> 01:21:06.466
Go get them! Go get them, Crusaders!

01:21:08.876 --> 01:21:11.902
Ready, set, go!

01:21:23.824 --> 01:21:25.951
Ready, set, go!

01:21:35.436 --> 01:21:37.267
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Michael!

01:21:39.607 --> 01:21:41.199
Set, go!

01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:50.173
Yeah!

01:21:53.788 --> 01:21:57.849
Hey! Hey! Rub the head, rub the head.
All right, let's go!

01:21:58.359 --> 01:22:00.884
- Oh.
- Tackle, over there.

01:22:01.662 --> 01:22:03.892
Ready, set, go!

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:07.299
Stay.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:29.580
Ready, 21! Ready, 21!

01:22:29.924 --> 01:22:31.653
Set!

01:22:31.892 --> 01:22:33.450
Pull it!

01:22:53.914 --> 01:22:56.314
Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold.

01:22:56.484 --> 01:22:58.543
Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold.

01:22:58.719 --> 01:23:02.086
Coach Saban wants his monthly
recruiting updates FedExed.

01:23:02.256 --> 01:23:06.750
Does he really think getting it one day
early is gonna give LSU a leg up?

01:23:07.161 --> 01:23:09.959
Hey, have you filled all the slots
in the Army all-star game?

01:23:10.131 --> 01:23:11.428
Yeah, why?

01:23:11.599 --> 01:23:13.123
You might wanna open one up.

01:23:30.117 --> 01:23:31.675
Oh.

01:23:35.589 --> 01:23:36.613
Wow.

01:23:51.872 --> 01:23:53.999
What did I tell you?

01:24:02.817 --> 01:24:05.251
I want him. I want him bad.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.653
<i>Y- E-L-L, everybody yell.
Say, everybody yell.</i>

01:24:10.825 --> 01:24:14.693
<i>Y- E-L-L, everybody yell</i>

01:24:14.862 --> 01:24:17.524
Nice kick this time, Collins. Nice job.

01:24:17.698 --> 01:24:19.563
What in the world?

01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:23.303
All right, y’all keep practicing.
Remember, point your toes.

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:28.464
<i>One, two, three, one! One, two,
three, two! One, two, three, three!</i>

01:24:28.642 --> 01:24:30.803
You gonna buckle up today, son?

01:24:33.113 --> 01:24:36.480
Shoot, man, Fulmer's here.
Might as well go home.

01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:39.778
What do you say, fellas? Doing
all right? Good to see everybody.

01:24:39.954 --> 01:24:42.218
Came all the way from Knoxville
to see for myself.

01:24:42.389 --> 01:24:45.517
Heck, coach, we drove from Clemson,
nine hours.

01:24:45.693 --> 01:24:47.285
Coach Fulmer. It's a real honor.

01:24:47.461 --> 01:24:50.396
My pleasure. I've watched your program.
You've done really well.

01:24:50.564 --> 01:24:53.692
I don't think there's any question
you’ll be at the next level soon.

01:24:53.868 --> 01:24:56.701
Oh, well, you know, we do
what we can with what we've got.

01:24:57.571 --> 01:25:00.165
Is that-? Is that Michael? Is that O'Hare?

01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:04.607
It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:11.150
You think we might see some drills,
perhaps?

01:25:11.318 --> 01:25:15.379
- I think all the coaches would appreciate it.
- Oh, yes, sir. You bet.

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:19.490
Listen up, fellas!
We're gonna do a board drill.

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.151
Big Mike,
Jay Collis, best on best right here.

01:25:22.329 --> 01:25:24.024
Let's go, come on, come on!

01:25:32.172 --> 01:25:33.264
On the whistle, men.

01:25:53.727 --> 01:25:54.751
Wow.

01:26:01.802 --> 01:26:02.826
Coach. Thank you.

01:26:03.003 --> 01:26:05.904
- Where are you off to, coach?
- Back to South Carolina.

01:26:06.073 --> 01:26:10.134
You tell Michael Oher, if he can qualify
with the grades, Clemson wants him.

01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:12.541
Yeah, good luck with that, Brad.

01:26:12.713 --> 01:26:14.772
You've done a great job
with this young man.

01:26:14.949 --> 01:26:17.144
He was a little raw
when we first got him...

01:26:17.318 --> 01:26:19.752
...but we've, you know,
coached him up a little bit.

01:26:22.856 --> 01:26:24.915
Where is that?

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:28.459
Well, make me guess.

01:26:30.364 --> 01:26:31.388
Hello, Mama.

01:26:31.565 --> 01:26:34.363
Did you know to be eligible
for a Division I scholarship...

01:26:34.535 --> 01:26:38.631
- ...Michael will need to make a 2.5 GPA?
- Really?

01:26:38.806 --> 01:26:43.334
His ACT is low and I don't see it getting
any better if he retakes it. Right there.

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:44.772
Well, what's his GPA now?

01:26:44.945 --> 01:26:47.470
1.76.

01:26:47.648 --> 01:26:49.912
That's not bad when you
consider where he started.

01:26:50.084 --> 01:26:52.450
Well, he's gonna have to
make all A's this year.

01:26:52.953 --> 01:26:56.548
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.

01:26:56.724 --> 01:26:58.316
So he goes to a junior college.

01:26:59.026 --> 01:27:01.927
Unh-uhn. Most inner-city kids that
go to JC drop out in the first year.

01:27:02.096 --> 01:27:04.360
And his shot at the pros
would go out the window.

01:27:04.531 --> 01:27:07.591
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?

01:27:10.771 --> 01:27:13.262
<i>Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.</i>

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.806
<i>Looking forward to you
coming down and visiting.</i>

01:27:15.976 --> 01:27:18.945
<i>Greetings, I'm Lou Holtz
from South Carolina. I'm call-</i>

01:27:19.113 --> 01:27:22.605
<i>We are very interested in having
Michael over to Knoxville for a visit.</i>

01:27:23.851 --> 01:27:25.079
Phil Fulmer, Tennessee.

01:27:25.252 --> 01:27:29.655
There's 20 more of them on there.
And these things right here, 50 of them.

01:27:29.823 --> 01:27:31.290
- Any of those from Ole Miss?
- No.

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:34.393
They're not gonna start recruiting
till they hire another coach.

01:27:34.561 --> 01:27:38.292
Doesn't make any difference
unless Michael makes his grades. Ahem.

01:27:39.666 --> 01:27:40.690
What are we gonna do?

01:27:42.844 --> 01:27:45.938
I understand you applied
for a teaching position at Wingate.

01:27:47.181 --> 01:27:48.978
I wasn't religious enough for them.

01:27:49.617 --> 01:27:55.180
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,
but I have certain, shall we say, doubts.

01:27:56.257 --> 01:27:58.282
Well, I appreciate your honesty,
Miss Sue.

01:27:58.659 --> 01:28:00.251
What's the situation with Michael?

01:28:00.428 --> 01:28:02.896
- He needs to do better in school.
- Obviously.

01:28:03.064 --> 01:28:04.326
But why the big push?

01:28:04.498 --> 01:28:08.559
Well, he's in line for a football
scholarship if he gets his grades up.

01:28:08.736 --> 01:28:11.899
- Is he considering Ole Miss?
- Better be.

01:28:13.307 --> 01:28:14.865
I'd love to work with him.

01:28:15.042 --> 01:28:17.442
Well, when would you like to start?

01:28:18.312 --> 01:28:22.180
Mrs. Tuohy, um, there's something
you should know about me.

01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:24.045
I don't usually tell many people...

01:28:24.218 --> 01:28:27.881
...but it's something I feel you should
be aware of before you hire me.

01:28:28.556 --> 01:28:30.615
Uh- What is it?

01:28:31.525 --> 01:28:33.049
I'm a Democrat.

01:28:35.196 --> 01:28:36.959
Okay.

01:28:42.236 --> 01:28:44.761
- I don't understand it.
- Yet.

01:28:44.939 --> 01:28:47.203
You don't understand it yet.

01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:50.500
How big is your head, Michael?

01:28:50.745 --> 01:28:52.076
Big.

01:28:52.246 --> 01:28:53.679
And what's in there?

01:28:53.848 --> 01:28:55.145
- A brain.
- A brain.

01:28:55.316 --> 01:28:57.011
It's full of knowledge.

01:28:57.184 --> 01:29:01.814
Like a file cabinet with maps,
and shortcuts for figuring things out.

01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.324
You'll get there, Michael Oher, because
I'm here to help you use those maps...

01:29:06.494 --> 01:29:10.521
...and reach your destination,
like Sacagawea led Lewis and Clark.

01:29:10.698 --> 01:29:11.926
Sacagawea?

01:29:12.099 --> 01:29:15.466
We'll get to that.
And the history books have it wrong.

01:29:15.636 --> 01:29:18.833
All you need to know
is I'll get you there.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.631
Do you believe me?

01:29:24.412 --> 01:29:26.039
You trust me, Michael?

01:29:28.282 --> 01:29:29.306
Yes, Miss Sue.

01:29:32.153 --> 01:29:33.347
Try it again.

01:29:34.889 --> 01:29:37.722
What's the next one? Read that
to me. Okay, what does it say?

01:29:37.892 --> 01:29:42.329
First we have to find the constant.
Now, where is the constant?

01:29:42.930 --> 01:29:45.091
Good. See?

01:29:45.266 --> 01:29:48.463
Who'd have thought we'd have
a black son before we knew a Democrat?

01:29:50.638 --> 01:29:53.835
Doorbell!
I got it, guys.

01:29:56.444 --> 01:29:58.503
Coach, how are you? Come in.
Sean Tuohy.

01:29:58.679 --> 01:30:01.477
- Nick Saban, nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. My pleasure.

01:30:01.649 --> 01:30:03.913
I appreciate the opportunity
to come in your home.

01:30:04.085 --> 01:30:06.519
- This is my daughter, Collins.
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:30:06.687 --> 01:30:09.554
- And you must be Leigh Anne.
- That would be me, Coach Saban.

01:30:09.724 --> 01:30:11.157
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:30:11.325 --> 01:30:13.816
Just call me Nick.
This is an incredible home.

01:30:13.995 --> 01:30:16.225
The Windsor valances are a nice touch.

01:30:16.397 --> 01:30:20.390
Well, thank you.
You obviously have excellent taste.

01:30:20.568 --> 01:30:22.502
Well, we appreciate quality...

01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:24.535
...and recognize it when we see it.

01:30:26.107 --> 01:30:28.507
Michael, why don't you come in
and say hello?

01:30:28.676 --> 01:30:31.008
- Nick Saban. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:30:31.178 --> 01:30:33.271
And you must be SJ.
- That's me.

01:30:33.447 --> 01:30:36.848
Michael, why don't you and Nick
go into the living room and talk?

01:30:37.184 --> 01:30:38.310
Can SJ come?

01:30:38.486 --> 01:30:41.512
- Absolutely. We'll recruit the both of you.
- All right.

01:30:44.525 --> 01:30:46.686
I find him extremely handsome.

01:30:46.861 --> 01:30:48.761
Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.

01:30:48.929 --> 01:30:50.453
Yeah, I know.

01:30:50.631 --> 01:30:53.623
So, Michael, we would love
to get you down to LSU for a visit.

01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:55.769
We've got a great thing going
right now.

01:30:55.936 --> 01:30:59.394
You have an opportunity to be
successful as a person, as a student...

01:30:59.573 --> 01:31:03.805
...and an opportunity to be a part of the
next national championship team at LSU.

01:31:03.978 --> 01:31:07.004
So, what do you say?
Would you like to commit to a visit?

01:31:07.181 --> 01:31:08.614
Can I ask a question?
Sure.

01:31:08.949 --> 01:31:12.476
My brother and I are very close,
and so...

01:31:12.653 --> 01:31:17.488
...I'm very afraid that if he goes off
to school, I might not get to see him.

01:31:17.658 --> 01:31:19.319
- So...
- Go on.

01:31:19.493 --> 01:31:23.293
I guess I was just wondering
how much access I'd have to him.

01:31:23.464 --> 01:31:25.898
Well, SJ, you would have
total access to Michael.

01:31:26.067 --> 01:31:29.161
But better than that, in his first game
in Tiger Stadium...

01:31:29.336 --> 01:31:32.100
...we would like for you to lead
the team out of the tunnel.

01:31:32.273 --> 01:31:34.673
- What do you think about that?
- Sounds good.

01:31:49.156 --> 01:31:50.350
Come on in.

01:31:50.524 --> 01:31:53.721
Greetings. I'm Lou Holtz from
the University of South Carolina.

01:31:53.894 --> 01:31:56.863
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Come on in. Michael?

01:31:57.031 --> 01:31:59.158
Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville,
Auburn University.

01:31:59.333 --> 01:32:01.528
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Michael?

01:32:01.702 --> 01:32:05.160
- Houston Nutt, University of Arkansas.
- Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.

01:32:05.339 --> 01:32:07.864
- Ole Miss cup, huh?
- Michael?

01:32:10.044 --> 01:32:12.308
Oh, come on. You know this.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.209
It's logical.

01:32:25.459 --> 01:32:28.019
I guarantee, you come to
University of South Carolina...

01:32:28.195 --> 01:32:30.686
...it'll be the smartest decision
you've ever made.

01:32:30.865 --> 01:32:34.494
We want you, we need you,
but the other thing is, Mike, you need us.

01:32:38.239 --> 01:32:39.263
Ow!

01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:42.375
Knoxville is a tremendous place
to live and-

01:32:42.543 --> 01:32:45.535
I know there's Lions,
there's Tigers, there's Bears.

01:32:45.713 --> 01:32:47.840
Hey, there's only one Razorback
in the world.

01:32:48.015 --> 01:32:51.746
And not only that, you will look great
in Gamecock red.

01:32:51.919 --> 01:32:52.943
What's in it for me?

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:56.817
SJ, I'm gonna get you a hog hat
and the whole family a hog hat.

01:32:56.991 --> 01:32:59.118
Are you telling me that’s
the best you can do?

01:32:59.293 --> 01:33:01.591
SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.

01:33:01.762 --> 01:33:04.128
Coach, help me help you.

01:33:04.298 --> 01:33:07.825
I can give you a Gamecock headdress,
and with real feathers.

01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:20.011
- What do you got for me, Phil?
- I've been thinking a lot about that...

01:33:20.181 --> 01:33:22.775
...and one of the things
I think would be special...

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:26.943
...is we'll walk arm-in-arm to the center
of Neyland Stadium in the first ball game...

01:33:27.121 --> 01:33:29.453
...and do the coin toss together.
How's that sound?

01:33:29.623 --> 01:33:32.091
Coach Fulmer, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:33:32.259 --> 01:33:35.057
My pleasure, CJ. You bet you, buddy.

01:33:45.372 --> 01:33:46.896
Congratulations on getting hired.

01:33:47.074 --> 01:33:49.838
Thank you, ma'am.
Ole Miss is my dream job.

01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:53.138
You're coming a little late to the party
and we're diehard Rebels...

01:33:53.314 --> 01:33:55.748
...so I'm gonna pretty much
give you a road map.

01:33:55.916 --> 01:33:57.543
- Got it.
- LSU is out.

01:33:57.718 --> 01:33:59.709
Everybody knows Saban's
going to the NFL.

01:33:59.887 --> 01:34:02.685
Don't wanna name names,
but on Michael’s first two trips...

01:34:02.856 --> 01:34:05.120
- ...somebody took him to a titty bar.
- Terrible.

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:07.487
Tell me about it.
He had nightmares for weeks.

01:34:07.661 --> 01:34:09.959
So when he visits,
I want you to feed him Italian.

01:34:10.130 --> 01:34:12.724
He likes fettuccine Alfredo.
And take him to a movie.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.131
<i>Not Chainsaw Massacre
because he’ll just cover his eyes.</i>

01:34:16.303 --> 01:34:18.703
Then get him in bed by 10. Got it?

01:34:18.872 --> 01:34:20.066
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

01:34:20.241 --> 01:34:22.072
- What about Tennessee?
- Mm.

01:34:22.409 --> 01:34:24.240
Breaks my heart,
but they're still in the hunt.

01:34:24.411 --> 01:34:26.777
Ahem. Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.

01:34:26.947 --> 01:34:29.507
- I hear that kid can really pepper the gumbo.
- Hmm.

01:34:29.683 --> 01:34:32.413
He's his daddy's boy. You ready?

01:34:32.586 --> 01:34:34.486
- Let's do it.
- All right.

01:34:34.655 --> 01:34:37.089
Mike, do you love barbecue?
I tell you what, Mike.

01:34:37.258 --> 01:34:40.716
You can go to a gas station and
get the best barbecue you ever got.

01:34:40.894 --> 01:34:42.361
It's a wonderful place to live.

01:34:42.529 --> 01:34:46.693
Fried catfish, all the good food that
we love to eat and that's not good for us...

01:34:46.867 --> 01:34:49.131
...you can have it there, Mike,
I promise you.

01:34:49.303 --> 01:34:51.601
And for you, SJ, this is what I can do.

01:34:51.772 --> 01:34:53.865
At Ole Miss, we have
The Grove by the stadium.

01:34:54.041 --> 01:34:57.442
We walk it before every game
in front of thousands of people.

01:34:57.611 --> 01:34:59.511
It's a sacred ritual. And I'm in front.

01:35:00.047 --> 01:35:01.947
Seen it a thousand times.

01:35:02.116 --> 01:35:05.882
Ever seen it from the front of the line?
Next year, you and me, leading the team.

01:35:06.053 --> 01:35:09.989
Tennessee offered to let me
run on the field and flip the coin.

01:35:12.926 --> 01:35:14.985
I'll throw in a sideline pass.

01:35:25.272 --> 01:35:26.705
Have you decided yet, Michael?

01:35:27.474 --> 01:35:29.374
No, Miss Sue.

01:35:30.144 --> 01:35:32.510
But you like Tennessee?

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.811
Yeah. That's a good school.

01:35:35.916 --> 01:35:37.907
Not at the academic level of Ole Miss...

01:35:38.085 --> 01:35:41.077
...but they have a outstanding
Science Department.

01:35:41.955 --> 01:35:44.185
You know what they're famous for?

01:35:44.625 --> 01:35:46.889
They work with the FBI...

01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:51.020
...to study the effects of soil
on decomposing body parts.

01:35:51.198 --> 01:35:52.893
What's that mean?

01:35:53.067 --> 01:35:56.525
Well, when they find a body, the police
wanna know how long it's been dead.

01:35:56.704 --> 01:35:59.639
So the fine folks at Tennessee
help them out.

01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:03.137
Oh, they have lots of body parts.

01:36:03.344 --> 01:36:07.405
Arms and legs and hands...

01:36:07.581 --> 01:36:10.106
...from hospitals and medical schools.

01:36:12.886 --> 01:36:14.751
And do you know where they store them?

01:36:18.692 --> 01:36:20.853
Right underneath the football field.

01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:27.558
So while it's fine and dandy
to have 100,000 fans cheering for you...

01:36:27.735 --> 01:36:32.365
...the bodies you should be worried about
are the ones right under the turf.

01:36:32.539 --> 01:36:35.633
Set to poke up through the ground
and grab you.

01:36:40.447 --> 01:36:43.416
Well, it's your decision
where you wanna play ball.

01:36:43.584 --> 01:36:45.779
Don't let me influence you.

01:37:14.448 --> 01:37:17.713
All the other teachers are on board.
I don't know what your problem is.

01:37:17.885 --> 01:37:21.821
I'm sorry. I will not give a student
a grade he or she doesn't deserve.

01:37:22.122 --> 01:37:25.455
Well, Michael needs a B.

01:37:25.626 --> 01:37:28.288
What does he have to do
to deserve that?

01:37:29.963 --> 01:37:32.830
Right now Michael’s doing
C- minus, D-plus work.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:37.166
His best chance at improvement is
the written essay at the end of the year.

01:37:37.337 --> 01:37:39.430
It counts for a third of the grade.

01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:43.470
Well, that's it. We're sunk.

01:37:44.845 --> 01:37:47.712
<i>Why don't you write about
Great Expectations?</i>

01:37:47.881 --> 01:37:49.746
You're a lot like Pip.

01:37:49.917 --> 01:37:55.378
I mean, he was poor. He was an orphan
and someone kind of found him.

01:37:55.556 --> 01:37:57.456
You should be able to relate to that.

01:38:01.528 --> 01:38:04.588
Fine. We'll go through the reading list.

01:38:04.765 --> 01:38:07.461
But you're gonna have to pick one,
Michael.

01:38:07.901 --> 01:38:08.925
<i>Pygmalion.</i>

01:38:12.372 --> 01:38:14.203
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

01:38:14.374 --> 01:38:16.239
"The Charge of the Light Brigade."

01:38:16.410 --> 01:38:19.846
<i>Half a league, half a league
Half a league onward</i>

01:38:20.013 --> 01:38:21.571
I love that one.

01:38:21.949 --> 01:38:24.213
He loves it.

01:38:25.886 --> 01:38:29.344
Why don't you do this?
And I'll watch basketball.

01:38:33.093 --> 01:38:34.492
Okay.

01:38:38.098 --> 01:38:41.727
<i>All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

01:38:42.569 --> 01:38:46.528
They named LSU's stadium Death Valley
because of this story.

01:38:47.608 --> 01:38:51.169
Alfred, Lord Tennyson
was writing about LSU-Ole Miss.

01:38:51.345 --> 01:38:52.676
- You're kidding.
- No.

01:38:52.846 --> 01:38:55.940
- It's a great story.
- It's a poem!

01:38:56.116 --> 01:38:58.584
<i>"Forward, the Light Brigade!"</i>

01:38:58.752 --> 01:39:00.083
That's like the offense.

01:39:00.254 --> 01:39:02.381
<i>"Charge for the guns," he said:</i>

01:39:02.556 --> 01:39:03.750
It's the end zone.

01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:06.691
<i>Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:10.591
<i>"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Was there a man dismay'd?</i>

01:39:11.331 --> 01:39:14.664
<i>Not tho' the soldier knew
Someone had blunder'd:</i>

01:39:14.835 --> 01:39:16.359
Someone made a mistake?

01:39:16.937 --> 01:39:19.405
Yeah. Their leader.

01:39:19.706 --> 01:39:20.934
Their coach.

01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:27.040
But why would they go ahead
if they knew he messed up?

01:39:29.683 --> 01:39:32.117
<i>Theirs not to make reply</i>

01:39:32.452 --> 01:39:35.148
<i>Theirs not to reason why</i>

01:39:35.522 --> 01:39:37.956
<i>Theirs but to do and die:</i>

01:39:38.692 --> 01:39:41.661
<i>Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

01:39:44.464 --> 01:39:46.159
They're all gonna die, aren't they?

01:39:48.468 --> 01:39:49.492
Yeah.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:55.736
That's really, really sad.

01:39:58.912 --> 01:40:01.745
I think you just found
something to write about, Michael.

01:40:18.131 --> 01:40:20.599
<i>Courage is a hard thing to figure.</i>

01:40:20.767 --> 01:40:24.635
<i>You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or a mistake...</i>

01:40:24.805 --> 01:40:27.103
<i>...but you're not supposed to
question adults...</i>

01:40:27.274 --> 01:40:31.506
<i>...or your coach or your teacher
because they make the rules.</i>

01:40:32.479 --> 01:40:36.176
<i>Maybe they know best,
but maybe they don't.</i>

01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:41.277
<i>It all depends on who you are,
where you come from.</i>

01:40:41.455 --> 01:40:44.322
<i>Didn't at least one of the 600 guys
think about giving up...</i>

01:40:44.491 --> 01:40:46.721
<i>...and joining with the other side?</i>

01:40:46.893 --> 01:40:50.727
<i>I mean, valley of Death,
that's pretty salty stuff.</i>

01:40:53.166 --> 01:40:54.963
<i>That's why courage is tricky.</i>

01:40:56.003 --> 01:40:59.370
<i>Should you always do
what others tell you to do?</i>

01:41:00.007 --> 01:41:03.170
<i>Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.</i>

01:41:03.343 --> 01:41:06.039
<i>I mean, any fool can have courage.</i>

01:41:06.847 --> 01:41:10.840
<i>But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.</i>

01:41:11.418 --> 01:41:14.353
<i>It's who you are
and maybe who you want to be.</i>

01:41:15.756 --> 01:41:17.917
<i>If you die trying for
something important...</i>

01:41:18.091 --> 01:41:22.551
<i>...then you have both honor and
courage, and that's pretty good.</i>

01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:25.428
<i>I think that's what the writer was saying.</i>

01:41:25.599 --> 01:41:29.433
<i>That you should hope for courage
and try for honor.</i>

01:41:29.603 --> 01:41:35.166
<i>And maybe even pray that the people
telling you what to do have some too.</i>

01:41:39.212 --> 01:41:40.873
Kevin Lin.

01:41:45.919 --> 01:41:48.820
- Good job.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:41:50.157 --> 01:41:53.092
Matthew Nichols.

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.695
- 2.52.
- Hmm?

01:41:56.897 --> 01:42:01.129
Michael’s final GPA.
Got it off of Paul’s computer.

01:42:01.334 --> 01:42:03.393
He did it, Sean. He did it.

01:42:04.104 --> 01:42:06.402
Wait a minute. You broke into
the principal’s computer?

01:42:06.573 --> 01:42:08.040
Hmm?

01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:10.872
Michael Oher.

01:42:15.182 --> 01:42:17.013
Michael.

01:42:17.918 --> 01:42:20.614
Where in the world did you find
a baby picture of Michael?

01:42:20.787 --> 01:42:23.722
Scanned it off an Internet ad
for a toddler boutique.

01:42:30.097 --> 01:42:32.861
- Congratulations, Michael.
Thank you.

01:42:48.415 --> 01:42:49.848
Michael, up top!

01:42:53.286 --> 01:42:54.753
Way to go, bro.

01:42:55.422 --> 01:42:56.855
All right, that's enough.

01:42:57.023 --> 01:43:00.481
Young man, I think I need a proper hug.

01:43:05.966 --> 01:43:08.434
You're gonna be staying
in Deaton Hall. Where is it?

01:43:08.602 --> 01:43:09.899
It's 109. It's right there.

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:13.631
You'll be on the meal plan so you’ll be
eating over here in Johnson Commons.

01:43:13.807 --> 01:43:15.900
Johnson Commons, all-you-can-eat
self-serve ice cream.

01:43:16.076 --> 01:43:17.168
- Mm-hm.
- As much as you want?

01:43:18.545 --> 01:43:20.672
That's how Mama put on
her freshman 10.

01:43:22.082 --> 01:43:25.483
- Stop it.
- Whew.

01:43:26.219 --> 01:43:27.880
Hello.

01:43:29.456 --> 01:43:30.923
This is Mrs. Tuohy.

01:43:31.091 --> 01:43:35.391
They just wanna ask you a couple questions,
Michael. You have nothing to hide.

01:43:36.196 --> 01:43:38.824
Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?
My name is Jocelyn Granger.

01:43:38.999 --> 01:43:41.524
I'm the Assistant Director of
Enforcement for the NCAA.

01:43:41.701 --> 01:43:43.134
Please, call me Leigh Anne.

01:43:46.673 --> 01:43:48.300
So let's do this, shall we?

01:43:48.475 --> 01:43:51.740
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.

01:43:52.379 --> 01:43:54.074
And how long is that gonna take?

01:43:54.247 --> 01:43:55.373
A while.

01:43:57.784 --> 01:43:59.718
It's all right. It's okay.

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.512
Go on.

01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:05.215
Michael.

01:44:05.392 --> 01:44:08.987
Michael. I'll be waiting for you
in the lobby, all right?

01:44:12.732 --> 01:44:13.926
<i>I don't know, Sean.</i>

01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:16.330
Just have a bad feeling about this one.

01:44:16.503 --> 01:44:19.165
This woman is tough, tough, tough,
tough, tough. Hold on.

01:44:20.207 --> 01:44:21.731
Hey.

01:44:22.676 --> 01:44:24.576
The client wants what?

01:44:25.512 --> 01:44:28.572
Were you aware that Coach Cotton
was accepting a job at Ole Miss?

01:44:28.748 --> 01:44:29.772
No.

01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:32.612
And that this job offer came
after you signed with them?

01:44:33.854 --> 01:44:36.516
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian,
went to Ole Miss.

01:44:36.690 --> 01:44:37.714
He played basketball.

01:44:38.325 --> 01:44:40.793
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss
as well.

01:44:40.961 --> 01:44:42.258
She was a cheerleader.

01:44:42.429 --> 01:44:45.023
Is it safe to say that Ole Miss
is their favorite school?

01:44:45.198 --> 01:44:49.567
Do they like any other universities?
What about, say, Tennessee?

01:44:49.736 --> 01:44:51.226
No, they can't stand Tennessee.

01:44:52.939 --> 01:44:54.065
And your tutor.

01:44:54.241 --> 01:44:56.471
- Miss Sue?
- Miss Sue.

01:44:56.643 --> 01:44:59.578
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad too.

01:45:00.046 --> 01:45:02.879
Miss Sue ever try to persuade you
to attend Ole Miss?

01:45:08.555 --> 01:45:11.888
Did you know that the Tuohys
make generous donations to Ole Miss?

01:45:12.058 --> 01:45:14.720
That even Miss Sue makes donations?

01:45:14.895 --> 01:45:17.022
That the Tuohys,
they have a condo in Oxford...

01:45:17.197 --> 01:45:20.132
...so they can attend
as many athletic events as possible.

01:45:20.367 --> 01:45:25.634
That in fact, both Sean and Leigh Anne
Tuohy are by our definition boosters.

01:45:27.974 --> 01:45:29.771
Mr. Oher.

01:45:30.076 --> 01:45:31.907
Mr. Oher.

01:45:32.078 --> 01:45:35.013
Do you understand?
Do you know why I'm here?

01:45:36.283 --> 01:45:37.807
To investigate?

01:45:37.984 --> 01:45:40.976
Yes. To investigate.

01:45:41.154 --> 01:45:44.954
I'm here to investigate
your odd... predicament.

01:45:45.892 --> 01:45:49.658
Do you find it odd, your predicament?

01:45:51.464 --> 01:45:53.193
Michael.

01:45:53.767 --> 01:45:55.735
I don't know.

01:45:56.736 --> 01:46:00.672
- Can I-? Can I leave now?
- No, you can't.

01:46:01.908 --> 01:46:03.034
What do you want, ma'am?

01:46:03.209 --> 01:46:05.734
- I want the facts. I need the truth.
- I didn't lie.

01:46:05.912 --> 01:46:08.881
- I wanna know what you think about this.
- Think about what?!

01:46:18.425 --> 01:46:22.657
The NCAA fears that
with your recruitment...

01:46:22.829 --> 01:46:24.160
...a door might be opened...

01:46:24.631 --> 01:46:26.724
...that boosters from schools
in the South...

01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:29.892
...will become legal guardians
of young athletes without means...

01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:32.470
...and funnel them to their alma maters.

01:46:32.639 --> 01:46:35.836
I'm not saying I believe it.
I'm not saying I don't.

01:46:36.009 --> 01:46:39.809
But there are many people involved in this
case who would argue that the Tuohys...

01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:42.312
- ...they took you in, they clothed you...
- No.

01:46:42.482 --> 01:46:45.417
...they fed you, they paid for
your private education.

01:46:45.585 --> 01:46:48.486
- They bought you a car, paid for a tutor...
- No. No.

01:46:48.655 --> 01:46:53.649
...all as part of a plan to ensure that you
play football for the University of Mississippi.

01:47:11.244 --> 01:47:14.441
Michael? We're not finished.

01:47:14.614 --> 01:47:17.139
The toile's not available,
like I told you months ago.

01:47:17.317 --> 01:47:21.845
So why don't we go with the ticking?
The low nap. It's a beautiful-

01:47:22.022 --> 01:47:25.253
I'll call you back. Bye.
Michael. So, what happened?

01:47:25.558 --> 01:47:28.118
- Why'd you do it?
- What?

01:47:28.294 --> 01:47:30.762
All along you wanted me
to go to Ole Miss.

01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:32.955
Well, of course I did. We love Ole Miss.

01:47:33.133 --> 01:47:34.600
- Why'd you do this for me?
- What?

01:47:34.768 --> 01:47:38.033
Everything. Was it for you
or was it for me?

01:47:38.204 --> 01:47:41.139
Was it so I would go to school
where you wanted?

01:47:41.307 --> 01:47:43.468
Was it so I would do what you wanted?

01:47:43.643 --> 01:47:46.043
- Michael, no, I-
- That's what she thinks.

01:47:46.746 --> 01:47:47.974
Is she right?

01:47:48.515 --> 01:47:50.915
Michael, honey, I need for you
to just listen to me.

01:47:51.084 --> 01:47:52.642
Don't you dare lie to me.

01:47:56.122 --> 01:47:57.646
I'm not stupid.

01:47:57.824 --> 01:48:03.285
Michael? Michael, of course
you're not stupid, Michael. Mi-

01:48:07.033 --> 01:48:08.728
I should've followed him.

01:48:08.902 --> 01:48:10.893
You had no way of knowing
he'd disappear.

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.974
Was he right?

01:48:16.543 --> 01:48:18.534
What he said about us?

01:48:18.711 --> 01:48:20.269
Leigh Anne, be reasonable.

01:48:20.447 --> 01:48:24.213
We gave clothes to a boy who had one
pair of shorts and we gave him a bed.

01:48:24.384 --> 01:48:27.649
To hell with the NCAA.
I would do it again tomorrow.

01:48:27.821 --> 01:48:30.312
What about all the rest of it?

01:48:30.490 --> 01:48:34.085
All the stuff we did to make sure
that he got a scholarship.

01:48:34.727 --> 01:48:36.752
A scholarship to Ole Miss.

01:48:37.464 --> 01:48:40.024
He could go anywhere he wanted.
He knew that.

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.933
Oh, did he? Did you ask him?
Because I sure as hell know I never did.

01:48:47.807 --> 01:48:51.174
Hey. Come here.

01:48:59.285 --> 01:49:01.310
Yeah.

01:49:07.694 --> 01:49:10.094
Am I a good person?

01:49:10.263 --> 01:49:12.094
Not a joke.

01:49:12.265 --> 01:49:14.460
Not rhetorical.

01:49:16.136 --> 01:49:20.038
You are the best person that I know.

01:49:21.307 --> 01:49:25.141
Everything you do, you do for others.

01:49:26.613 --> 01:49:29.207
And why is that?

01:49:31.351 --> 01:49:33.876
I have not a clue.

01:49:34.721 --> 01:49:39.351
But you obviously get some sort of
sick satisfaction out of it.

01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:46.861
- Sean.
- Yeah?

01:49:47.133 --> 01:49:49.966
What if he never comes back?

01:49:56.309 --> 01:49:59.608
Oh. Heh. Whoo!

01:49:59.779 --> 01:50:03.681
Big Mike. Hey, get your ass
on in here, man.

01:50:03.850 --> 01:50:06.216
- I'm looking for my mama.
- Your mama?

01:50:06.386 --> 01:50:08.616
Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.

01:50:08.788 --> 01:50:11.018
As a matter of fact...

01:50:11.191 --> 01:50:14.592
Oh, yeah, she usually stop by
for a taste around this time.

01:50:14.994 --> 01:50:17.792
Look, I tell you what,
why don't you just come on inside?

01:50:17.964 --> 01:50:23.402
I'm gonna get you a 40, we gonna chop
it up like real folk. Just until she get here.

01:50:25.205 --> 01:50:28.402
Come on, now.
Ain't nobody gonna bite you, baby.

01:50:36.783 --> 01:50:37.772
Hey.

01:50:37.951 --> 01:50:41.148
Hey, Big Mike, go on down there
in the living room, man. Have a seat.

01:50:41.321 --> 01:50:42.948
Liven this bitch up in here, y’all.

01:50:43.122 --> 01:50:45.386
Give me a couple of 40s
out that refrigerator.

01:50:45.558 --> 01:50:47.150
- Sit down, man.
- Big Mike, boy.

01:50:47.327 --> 01:50:48.919
Damn, sure good to see you.

01:50:49.162 --> 01:50:52.222
Yeah, you looking good too.
You looking fit.

01:50:52.398 --> 01:50:53.990
I heard you playing a little ball.

01:50:55.168 --> 01:50:59.161
Y'all know that old rich-kid football ain't
got nothing on that public-school league.

01:50:59.339 --> 01:51:01.307
Niggas packing knives in they socks.

01:51:03.309 --> 01:51:05.573
Hey. I played a little ball myself.

01:51:05.745 --> 01:51:08.908
- Back in the day. You knew that, right?
- Yeah, I heard.

01:51:09.115 --> 01:51:13.449
Little quarterback. Up there at MLK.
Yeah.

01:51:13.886 --> 01:51:14.910
Thank you, baby.

01:51:15.088 --> 01:51:18.251
What about you, David?
You still playing ball over at JC?

01:51:18.424 --> 01:51:21.552
- Naw, br-
- No, man. David ain't with that no more.

01:51:21.728 --> 01:51:23.252
He with me now.

01:51:23.429 --> 01:51:27.593
As a matter of fact, look,
I can open up a spot for you too.

01:51:27.767 --> 01:51:31.430
I got tired of going to class.
People always trying to tell me what to do.

01:51:31.604 --> 01:51:36.132
Well, in that case, then, look here,
turn that up right there, little-bitty bitch!

01:51:36.609 --> 01:51:39.271
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Bitty bitch!

01:51:41.681 --> 01:51:44.673
Hey, man. I'm just messing with D, man.

01:51:45.318 --> 01:51:48.719
Ahh. I heard you staying
on the other side of town.

01:51:49.522 --> 01:51:54.186
Yeah, that what Dee Dee said. Said you
got you a new mama now. Yeah, man.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.294
Hell, yeah.
She fine too.

01:51:56.462 --> 01:51:58.760
Yeah, she fine. Mm-mm. Ooh!

01:51:59.065 --> 01:52:01.499
Hey, she got any other kids?

01:52:04.637 --> 01:52:06.332
She got a daughter?

01:52:08.074 --> 01:52:10.008
You tap that?

01:52:12.545 --> 01:52:15.343
Yeah. Yeah, you tapped that, didn't you?
Yeah.

01:52:15.515 --> 01:52:16.675
Big Mike!

01:52:16.849 --> 01:52:20.307
Big Mike done got a little piece,
y’all! He can't stand hisself now.

01:52:20.486 --> 01:52:22.044
Hey, Big-

01:52:22.322 --> 01:52:24.586
He done- He done lost his mind.

01:52:24.757 --> 01:52:25.849
Hey, where you going?

01:52:26.025 --> 01:52:28.493
I'm gonna just go wait for Mama
at the apartment.

01:52:32.231 --> 01:52:34.324
Hey, man. Just go on heading on.

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:39.631
Sit down. I'm just trying to find
out a little bit about your fine white sister.

01:52:39.839 --> 01:52:42.808
Because I likes me some of
that mommy-daughter action.

01:52:42.975 --> 01:52:45.000
Shut up.

01:52:48.915 --> 01:52:50.382
"Shut up"?

01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:53.542
Who in the hell is you telling to shut up?

01:52:56.122 --> 01:52:58.682
I will bust a cap in your fat ass...

01:52:58.858 --> 01:53:01.918
...and then drive east to pay a visit
to your cracker-ass mama...

01:53:02.095 --> 01:53:03.392
...and her sweet little daughter.

01:53:07.166 --> 01:53:08.258
Big fella.

01:53:18.811 --> 01:53:20.608
My baby!

01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:23.747
You monster! Get out!

01:53:36.262 --> 01:53:37.456
- Mama!
- Mama!

01:54:00.186 --> 01:54:03.019
He gone, snowflake.

01:54:08.828 --> 01:54:10.352
Michael was here?

01:54:10.530 --> 01:54:14.466
Yeah, but you tell him I'll be seeing
him around. Oh, he gonna get his.

01:54:15.234 --> 01:54:16.792
So Michael was here?

01:54:17.203 --> 01:54:19.899
Last night. Gonna come by here
and sneak me then run off.

01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.607
Yeah. Tell him to sleep
with one eye open.

01:54:24.811 --> 01:54:25.971
You hear me, bitch?

01:54:32.518 --> 01:54:34.782
No, you hear me, bitch.

01:54:35.555 --> 01:54:39.150
You threaten my son, you threaten me.

01:54:39.325 --> 01:54:42.954
You so much as cross into downtown,
you will be sorry.

01:54:43.129 --> 01:54:44.858
I'm in a prayer group with the DA...

01:54:45.031 --> 01:54:47.795
...I'm a member of the NRA,
and I'm always packing.

01:54:53.172 --> 01:54:56.471
What you got in there, a. 22?
Or a Saturday Night Special?

01:54:57.844 --> 01:55:01.336
Mm-hm. And it shoots just fine
all the other days too.

01:55:26.906 --> 01:55:28.271
<i>- Michael?
Mama?</i>

01:55:56.569 --> 01:55:58.764
<i>You think the police
are gonna come and get me?</i>

01:55:59.772 --> 01:56:02.297
I imagine the last thing
they want in Hurt Village...

01:56:02.475 --> 01:56:05.239
...is a bunch of cops snooping around.

01:56:08.214 --> 01:56:13.151
I swore I would never ask this, but
how did you get out of there, Michael?

01:56:15.888 --> 01:56:19.483
When I was little and
something awful was happening...

01:56:19.659 --> 01:56:21.820
...my mama would tell me
to close my eyes.

01:56:22.662 --> 01:56:26.564
She was trying to keep me from
seeing her do drugs or other bad things.

01:56:27.199 --> 01:56:30.168
And when she was finished
or the bad things were over...

01:56:30.336 --> 01:56:35.672
...she'd say, "Now when I count to
three, you open your eyes.

01:56:35.841 --> 01:56:41.336
The past is gone, the world is a good
place, and it's all gonna be okay."

01:56:44.150 --> 01:56:46.448
You closed your eyes.

01:56:49.021 --> 01:56:53.481
You know, when I was driving
all over kingdom come looking for you...

01:56:53.659 --> 01:56:56.389
...I kept thinking about one thing.

01:56:57.363 --> 01:56:59.331
Ferdinand the Bull.

01:57:02.368 --> 01:57:06.168
I know I should've asked you this
a long time ago, Michael.

01:57:06.872 --> 01:57:09.033
But do you even wanna play football?

01:57:10.543 --> 01:57:13.034
I mean, do you even like it?

01:57:13.913 --> 01:57:15.312
I'm pretty good at it.

01:57:15.715 --> 01:57:17.580
Yeah, you are.

01:57:20.119 --> 01:57:21.780
Sean and I have been talking and...

01:57:22.288 --> 01:57:25.724
...Michael, if you're gonna
accept a football scholarship...

01:57:26.559 --> 01:57:29.619
...we think it should be to Tennessee.

01:57:31.731 --> 01:57:37.192
And I promise that I will be
at every game, cheering for you.

01:57:37.837 --> 01:57:40.431
- Every game?
- Every game.

01:57:41.841 --> 01:57:45.140
But I will not wear that gaudy orange.
I will not.

01:57:45.311 --> 01:57:47.871
It is not in my color wheel
and I'm not gonna wear it.

01:57:50.883 --> 01:57:53.875
So you want me to go to Tennessee?

01:57:54.654 --> 01:57:58.146
I want you to do whatever you want.

01:57:58.324 --> 01:58:01.225
It is your decision, Michael.
It's your life.

01:58:03.162 --> 01:58:05.096
What if I wanted to flip burgers?

01:58:08.834 --> 01:58:11.735
It's your decision. It's your life.

01:58:14.607 --> 01:58:16.404
Okay.

01:58:17.677 --> 01:58:19.076
Okay, what?

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:23.277
<i>I'm sorry I left the other day.</i>

01:58:23.449 --> 01:58:24.882
You were pretty upset.

01:58:25.051 --> 01:58:28.612
- You asked a lot of questions.
- I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.

01:58:28.788 --> 01:58:30.722
But all the questions you asked...

01:58:30.890 --> 01:58:33.859
...were about why everybody else
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

01:58:34.026 --> 01:58:35.050
Okay.

01:58:35.227 --> 01:58:37.889
Not once did you ask
why did I wanna go there.

01:58:39.965 --> 01:58:41.125
All right.

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:44.895
Fine, Michael. Why do you
wanna go to Ole Miss?

01:58:45.071 --> 01:58:48.199
Because it's where my family
goes to school.

01:58:48.841 --> 01:58:50.809
It's where they've always
gone to school.

01:58:58.718 --> 01:59:00.913
College will be a different
experience for you.

01:59:01.087 --> 01:59:02.076
SJ, stop it.

01:59:02.254 --> 01:59:04.654
- There's gonna be lots of distractions.
- Have fun.

01:59:04.824 --> 01:59:08.783
Always gonna be some nimrod in the dorm
who wants to play video games all night...

01:59:08.961 --> 01:59:10.792
...or fool around on the Internet.

01:59:10.963 --> 01:59:12.055
Just have fun.

01:59:12.231 --> 01:59:14.392
You'll be spending
a lot of time at practice...

01:59:14.567 --> 01:59:18.128
...which means you’ll have to be
very dedicated to your studies, all right?

01:59:18.304 --> 01:59:20.499
SJ, if you don't stop it right-
Come here.

01:59:20.673 --> 01:59:22.197
Relax, Mama.

01:59:22.408 --> 01:59:26.401
I just got back from the library. I reserved
a private cubicle for the semester.

01:59:26.579 --> 01:59:29.309
Here's your class schedule
and our study-hall hours.

01:59:29.482 --> 01:59:32.849
Now, if y’all don't mind, I'm gonna
go move into my new apartment.

01:59:33.018 --> 01:59:35.316
- Thank you, Miss Sue.
Thank you, Miss Sue.

01:59:35.488 --> 01:59:37.956
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's see what you got.

01:59:38.124 --> 01:59:41.719
College Writing, good. Psychology,
Math Lab, which is gonna be good-

01:59:41.894 --> 01:59:43.828
- Hi.
Well, you know why.

01:59:43.996 --> 01:59:45.520
A lot of good classes.

01:59:45.698 --> 01:59:48.462
- You gonna have a lot of fun.
SJ!

01:59:51.537 --> 01:59:54.506
Michael Oher, you listen to me,
all right?

01:59:54.673 --> 01:59:58.268
I want you to enjoy yourself, but if
you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock...

01:59:58.444 --> 02:00:02.540
...I will crawl in the car, drive up here
to Oxford, and I will cut off your penis.

02:00:02.882 --> 02:00:03.940
She means it.

02:00:05.317 --> 02:00:07.785
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

02:00:10.289 --> 02:00:13.725
Well, the 78's gonna be a parking lot
so we should get going.

02:00:13.893 --> 02:00:17.420
I want everyone to say their goodbyes,
all right? Here. Bye, baby.

02:00:17.596 --> 02:00:19.257
Thank you, Mama.
- You're welcome.

02:00:29.008 --> 02:00:31.033
Why does she always do that?

02:00:31.577 --> 02:00:35.707
She's an onion, Michael. You have to
peel her back a layer at a time.

02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:40.145
Be right back.

02:00:51.297 --> 02:00:53.094
What?

02:00:59.238 --> 02:01:00.262
What, Michael?

02:01:00.806 --> 02:01:03.104
I need a proper hug.

02:01:26.232 --> 02:01:29.724
<i>I read a story the other day
about a boy from the projects.</i>

02:01:30.636 --> 02:01:34.128
<i>No daddy, in and out of foster care.</i>

02:01:34.607 --> 02:01:38.338
<i>He'd been killed in a gang fight
at Hurt Village.</i>

02:01:38.744 --> 02:01:43.204
<i>In the last paragraph, they talked about
his superb athletic skills...</i>

02:01:43.382 --> 02:01:45.475
<i>...and how different
his life might've been...</i>

02:01:45.651 --> 02:01:48.586
<i>...if he hadn't fallen behind
and dropped out of school.</i>

02:01:48.754 --> 02:01:52.349
<i>He was 21 years old the day he died.</i>

02:01:52.524 --> 02:01:54.890
<i>It was his birthday.</i>

02:02:00.165 --> 02:02:02.190
<i>That could have been anyone.</i>

02:02:02.368 --> 02:02:05.201
<i>It could've been my son, Michael.</i>

02:02:05.804 --> 02:02:07.829
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

02:02:10.643 --> 02:02:13.908
<i>And I suppose I have God
to thank for that.</i>

02:02:16.649 --> 02:02:19.914
<i>God and Lawrence Taylor.</i>

02:02:31.096 --> 02:02:32.757
<i>One Mississippi.</i>

02:03:09.601 --> 02:03:15.130
The New England Patriots have traded
the 23rd pick to the Baltimore Ravens.

02:03:15.307 --> 02:03:18.799
And with the 23rd pick
in the 2009 NFL draft...

02:03:18.978 --> 02:03:24.678
...the Baltimore Ravens select Michael
Oher, offensive tackle, Mississippi.
