WEBVTT

00:06.541 --> 00:08.833
-A tower?
-I need it completed by spring.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.666
Have you considered
seeking partners outside

00:11.750 --> 00:13.500
-the confines of our own race?

00:13.583 --> 00:15.083
Tell me about your King's proposal

00:15.166 --> 00:17.500
so I can present it to my father.

00:17.625 --> 00:19.708
I'd sense it
if he were hiding something.

00:19.750 --> 00:23.083
Perhaps he sensed that
it was you who was hiding something.

00:23.750 --> 00:24.916
What is this place?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.583
The Island Kingdom of Númenor.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.125
I was thinking I might defer.

00:31.208 --> 00:33.625
When the Sea Trial begins
and that ship launches,

00:33.666 --> 00:34.791
you will be on it.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.541
I don't want any trouble.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.041
It is a map of the Southlands.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.375
It speaks not only of a place, but a plan.

00:46.458 --> 00:48.125
To create a realm of their own.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.166
Then the Southlands are in grave danger.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.416
If Sauron has indeed returned,

00:52.500 --> 00:54.250
the Southlands are but the beginning.

00:55.083 --> 00:57.291
If there are any of you here
who want to live...

00:58.500 --> 01:01.291
...we make for the Elven tower
at first light.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.833
Bring him to Adar.

01:07.000 --> 01:07.875
Adar!

01:07.958 --> 01:10.541
Sauron was said to have
many names in days of old.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.333
Perhaps this is one of them.

01:13.125 --> 01:17.291
Your people have no king,
for you are him.

01:17.375 --> 01:19.041
Come with me to Middle-earth.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.541
You're still short an army.

01:20.625 --> 01:23.208
That is all about to change.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.333
In this court,

03:01.416 --> 03:05.083
we gather daily
to hammer out our island's future.

03:05.666 --> 03:08.416
But at the Blessing of the Children,

03:09.208 --> 03:13.291
we gather to welcome those
who will live that future.

03:16.750 --> 03:20.541
One as boundless as a sunrise
over the rolling sea.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.333
What name have you chosen for her?

03:28.916 --> 03:30.125
Alinel.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.583
Alinel.

03:33.250 --> 03:37.041
May Númenor's strength arise in thee.

03:38.458 --> 03:41.083
Her wisdom guide thy steps...

03:46.833 --> 03:49.500
Sometimes our island just needs a stretch.

03:50.583 --> 03:51.833
Just like you.

04:34.208 --> 04:37.458
-It is a perfect day, Queen Regent.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.958
What business would you begin with?

04:44.666 --> 04:46.500
She summoned the Elf to court.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.625
Just this morning.

04:49.208 --> 04:53.750
Elf's mate attacks four guildsmen,
and Míriel has her up for tea?

04:53.833 --> 04:56.000
Probably she called
the Elf in to punish her.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.333
-Or to ask her for orders.

04:59.583 --> 05:03.416
And while the Elf whispers poison
in our Queen's ear,

05:03.500 --> 05:06.833
-who's speaking for us?

05:12.125 --> 05:14.250
Chancellor! Chancellor!

05:14.333 --> 05:17.375
Send her my regards, will you?
Keep your voice down.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.833
Would you like one, sir?
Come on, sir.

05:19.916 --> 05:22.625
I didn't realize you were in the middle
of something important.

05:22.708 --> 05:23.583
Chancellor!

05:23.666 --> 05:27.500
Statecraft is the art
of attending to small matters

05:27.583 --> 05:29.541
as diligently as grand ones.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.458
I should like to think
you'd learned that by now.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.291
I was only trying to be clever.

05:34.375 --> 05:38.125
Cleverness is for men
of small ambition.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.916
I'd much rather it
if you were wise, my son.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.083
Now, what seems to be the trouble, hmm?

05:46.583 --> 05:49.416
We may have a bit of a squall
on our hands.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.583
Elf ships on our shore?

05:52.208 --> 05:55.375
Elf workers taking your trades?

05:56.958 --> 05:58.958
Workers who don't sleep,

06:00.125 --> 06:03.125
don't tire, don't age.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.833
No!

06:06.416 --> 06:10.166
I say, the Queen's either blind

06:10.250 --> 06:12.083
or an Elf lover.

06:12.166 --> 06:14.375
-Just like her father.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.833
-Elf lover!
-Elf lover!

06:16.916 --> 06:18.708
Elf lover!

06:18.791 --> 06:20.583
Elf lover! Elf lover!

06:20.666 --> 06:24.041
And if the Elf were here now,
what would she see?

06:24.708 --> 06:26.333
Men of Númenor,

06:27.625 --> 06:29.875
or a gaggle of mewling children?

06:31.458 --> 06:34.208
We are sons and daughters of the Edain.

06:35.291 --> 06:39.375
Of Elros Tar-Minyatur, whose host
conquered Morgoth himself.

06:40.583 --> 06:44.208
But now one Elf, a castaway,
could threaten us?

06:45.250 --> 06:48.333
Look down, each of you,
at the guild crests you bear.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.708
The heritage of mighty hands.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.458
Of men who laid the Sea Wall.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.083
Who raised Armenelos,

06:58.166 --> 07:00.875
-triumph of our civilization.

07:01.375 --> 07:05.000
But now, one Elf could threaten us?

07:17.833 --> 07:18.916
My friends...

07:21.166 --> 07:22.250
Trust in me.

07:23.916 --> 07:26.458
For by the calluses on my hands,

07:26.541 --> 07:30.833
I swear that Elven hands
will never take Númenor's helm.

07:32.750 --> 07:37.083
She will remain, as always,
a kingdom of Men.

07:44.416 --> 07:45.625
Drinks all around!

07:59.083 --> 08:01.125
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

08:15.458 --> 08:18.208
Isn't a name in this city he doesn't know,

08:18.291 --> 08:21.000
a crowd he can't turn,
a favor he isn't owed...

08:22.458 --> 08:23.708
It's impressive.

08:24.541 --> 08:26.541
I was going to say "infuriating."

08:29.375 --> 08:31.583
From vineyards near the Meneltarma.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.416
Supposed to make you forget your troubles.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.875
-Or so they say.

08:35.875 --> 08:37.666
My troubles have been too hard-won.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.458
You must be the new apprentice.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.416
I'm Kemen. And your name is...

08:45.500 --> 08:48.083
Hey, Eärien. Plans, now.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.166
Oh.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.750
You vex me, Elf.

09:03.458 --> 09:05.291
I welcome you as a guest,

09:05.375 --> 09:09.125
and you gallop off to our countryside
to steal ancient scrolls

09:09.208 --> 09:12.583
whilst your Southlander companion
assaults our citizenry.

09:12.666 --> 09:16.083
He is understandably quick to temper.
His people are dying.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.708
"His people"?

09:17.791 --> 09:21.375
I believe the man you hold
in your dungeons is no common brawler,

09:21.458 --> 09:25.458
but the lost heir in exile
to the throne of the Southlands.

09:25.958 --> 09:28.875
And I suppose Elendil here
is a Rhûnic emperor.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.875
Just a petty lord, actually.

09:33.666 --> 09:36.458
His people are scattered. Leaderless.

09:37.458 --> 09:41.541
But with your backing they might unite
behind his banner. And fight.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.208
What do you mean "backing"?

09:43.291 --> 09:48.333
Sauron was once your people's enemy,
as much as mine.

09:49.291 --> 09:52.041
I call on you
to finish the task left undone.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.125
To reforge the alliance
between Númenor and Elves...

09:56.083 --> 09:59.458
And fight with me,
to save the men of the Southlands

09:59.541 --> 10:02.208
before Sauron claims their lands
for his own.

10:07.583 --> 10:10.083
In this court we hear many proposals.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.416
I dare say yours is the most surprising
and ambitious I've heard in weeks.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.333
Nevertheless, Númenor has chosen
another path.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.125
Not all Númenor.

10:24.666 --> 10:28.291
King or carpenter,
the Southlander will face judgment.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.833
This audience is ended.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.541
Then I have little choice,
but to ask for another.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.041
One with Númenor's true ruler.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.958
Your father, the King.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.875
You should not speak of matters
you do not understand,

10:55.958 --> 10:57.333
Galadriel, daughter of Finarfin.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.791
And you should stand aside,

10:58.875 --> 11:02.166
that I might present my proposal to one
who holds the authority to answer it.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.583
Lady Galadriel, that is quite enough.

11:03.666 --> 11:06.666
And with what authority do you speak, Elf?

11:06.750 --> 11:08.250
That of your people?

11:08.791 --> 11:12.291
Or are you a castaway,
grasping for a handhold in a tempest?

11:12.375 --> 11:14.375
There is a tempest in me.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.250
It swept me to this island for a reason.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.666
And it will not be quelled by you, Regent.

11:29.458 --> 11:30.458
Don't tell me.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.291
Tavern brawl?

11:34.125 --> 11:35.291
Sedition.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.541
You've nearly made it!

11:47.250 --> 11:48.666
In a few more days,

11:48.750 --> 11:53.000
I'll have the pleasure
of calling all of you shipmates.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.541
Pull now, cadets! Pull!

12:02.833 --> 12:05.625
Isildur...

12:18.458 --> 12:20.958
Pull now, cadets!

12:22.333 --> 12:23.166
Pull!

12:30.875 --> 12:31.708
Line!

12:39.250 --> 12:40.875
Sir, no, there must be
some sort of mistake.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.833
It was my fault, Sea-master.

12:43.666 --> 12:44.666
I let it slip.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.916
I've seen you ease that halyard
proper a hundred times.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.291
That was deliberate.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.791
You're off the Sea Guard!

12:55.833 --> 12:57.000
All three of you!

13:00.666 --> 13:04.208
"The West"? "The real Númenor"?

13:04.625 --> 13:07.125
That garbage your brother
used to spew, again!

13:09.375 --> 13:11.500
I thought the sail-master
would only dismiss me.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.416
I'm sorry.

13:14.916 --> 13:16.250
You're sorry?

13:16.833 --> 13:20.083
You're sorry?
You just set our whole lives on fire!

13:20.958 --> 13:23.583
Where's that chamber pot?
I think I'm gonna be sick.

13:23.666 --> 13:24.916
I will speak to my father.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.875
Convince him to see
that you're both reinstated.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.125
No. Leave it to you to get kicked out
of something

13:29.208 --> 13:30.958
you never earned in the first place.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.375
-Valandil...
-No.

13:33.666 --> 13:37.125
Since I was big enough to hold an oar,
I wanted on that boat.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.875
I did everything I was supposed to do
to earn it. And what did you do?

13:43.041 --> 13:46.541
What have you ever done but brood
and blabber about your dead mother.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.500
-Stop it! Stop it! Enough!

13:51.875 --> 13:53.875
Yeah, same old Isil walking away.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.166
Isil! Where are you going?

13:56.250 --> 13:58.916
Going, staying, what does it matter?

13:59.000 --> 14:02.833
The real problem is him.
And that's not going anywhere.

14:23.666 --> 14:25.041
Magrot!

14:27.541 --> 14:28.791
Adar...

15:20.458 --> 15:22.291
Adar...

16:15.500 --> 16:17.875
Nampak uglursha.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.666
Nampak uglursha.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.541
Where were you born,

16:48.125 --> 16:49.375
soldier?

16:52.875 --> 16:54.291
Beleriand.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.083
By the mouth of the river?

17:01.500 --> 17:02.875
Who are you?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.041
I went down that river once...

17:12.250 --> 17:13.750
When I was young.

17:17.916 --> 17:19.333
I remember...

17:21.458 --> 17:23.958
The banks were covered in sage blossoms.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.458
Miles of them.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.333
Why do the Orcs call you Father?

17:51.166 --> 17:53.916
You have been told many lies.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.916
Some run so deep,

17:59.083 --> 18:03.666
even the rocks and roots now believe them.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.208
To untangle it all...

18:08.541 --> 18:11.791
would all but require the creation
of a new world.

18:14.875 --> 18:17.583
But that is something
only the gods can do.

18:17.666 --> 18:21.500
And I am no god. At least...

18:26.250 --> 18:27.125
Not yet.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.833
What are you?

18:36.333 --> 18:39.875
Go to the Men who have taken refuge
in the old watchtower.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.083
Deliver to them a message.

18:50.666 --> 18:51.750
What message?

19:14.750 --> 19:18.583
The barracks are already full.
Try and make camp where you can.

19:20.083 --> 19:22.458
-Where's this lot from?
-Iorbad.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.958
That makes it every village
from here to Orodruin.

19:33.791 --> 19:34.875
Where's the rest?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.375
That is the rest.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.500
We'll have to cut rations again.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.125
You're not cutting my rations.

19:41.208 --> 19:43.666
Who gave you the right to decide?

19:43.750 --> 19:46.583
Everyone who decided to come
to this tower, Waldreg. Including you.

19:46.666 --> 19:47.750
What will we eat?

19:48.541 --> 19:50.083
-We'll find a way.
-How?

19:50.166 --> 19:52.791
-I don't know.
-Huh. Plain enough to see that.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.916
What about Waldreg's root cellar?

19:56.750 --> 19:58.708
We send a small party into town.

19:58.791 --> 20:02.916
By day, when the Orcs are fewer,
grab what we can, quick and quiet.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.083
They'll never even know we were there.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.083
What poor sod will you rope into that?

20:07.916 --> 20:10.208
I'll do it, if nobody else will.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.958
You're not going down there.

20:12.750 --> 20:16.166
We'll forage the hills again first.
Gather the hunters.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.375
And what will they hunt? A few rabbits?

20:19.458 --> 20:20.625
That'll feed us a day.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.458
Then it's another day.
And let us be grateful for it.

20:23.541 --> 20:24.625
I'm sick and tired

20:24.708 --> 20:27.833
of watching everything go to tatters
and not doing anything about it.

20:27.916 --> 20:30.250
-We are doing everything we can.
-Well, I'm not!

20:30.333 --> 20:31.750
Theo. Theo!

20:32.250 --> 20:34.750
You can either help me
or you can make it harder.

20:55.416 --> 20:57.791
I should never have let you
talk me into this.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.625
I'm heading back.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.333
Don't be such a soft-belly.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.416
Come on.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.416
Rowan, the tavern.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.958
I'm not going in there.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.833
-There might be more food.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.875
Come on, this place is deserted.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.625
All right. I'll go.

22:37.666 --> 22:38.750
Rowan?

23:15.583 --> 23:16.708
Young blood.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.583
Where'd you get that?

23:34.083 --> 23:35.250
Give it here.

23:46.208 --> 23:48.000
Oi! I found it!

23:48.083 --> 23:51.958
I found it! It's a boy! He has the hilt!

23:52.041 --> 23:53.708
A boy? Where is he?

23:53.791 --> 23:56.250
-He's hiding here somewhere.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.666
You! Send word to Lord-father.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.708
Rest of you, fan out.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.583
Nobody sleeps till he's found.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.583
Got ya!

24:51.208 --> 24:54.500
Elves and Dwarves working together.
Remarkable.

24:56.041 --> 24:58.291
It is everything you said it would be.

25:03.708 --> 25:04.541
What?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.250
Nothing. Just...

25:06.333 --> 25:09.666
For a moment, standing there,
you were the very image of your father.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.875
I wasn't aware
you'd ever met him.

25:13.958 --> 25:15.666
Of course, many times.

25:15.750 --> 25:19.000
He had that way of seeing far off.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.333
Do you know, I remember once,
he said to me,

25:24.541 --> 25:29.750
one day, my future would be
in his son's hands.

25:32.416 --> 25:35.791
He said it quite casually,
as if one might speak of tomorrow's rain.

25:36.791 --> 25:38.333
And I've... I've...

25:38.416 --> 25:42.250
I'd forgotten that until...
Till this moment.

25:44.416 --> 25:46.625
Isn't that odd?

25:48.375 --> 25:50.958
You seem unsettled today, my lord.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.083
-What troubles you?

25:54.250 --> 25:57.250
No, I promised myself I wouldn't
mention it. He's your friend.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.083
Durin.

26:00.500 --> 26:05.000
Either he's avoiding me
or he's... he's hiding something.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.416
Did you try asking his work teams?

26:18.500 --> 26:22.375
All nineteen of them.
They keep putting me off.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.666
One would almost think it suspicious.

26:26.041 --> 26:28.791
Are you suggesting Durin's got himself
a wee girlfriend?

26:28.875 --> 26:31.083
-There is none other than you, milady.
-I know.

26:31.208 --> 26:33.250
-Who'd have him?

26:35.375 --> 26:38.375
Rich crone, kiss the stone
Polish your gems and gold

26:38.458 --> 26:39.916
-Ow! Stop it!

26:40.041 --> 26:41.750
Gerda, stop hitting your brother!

26:41.833 --> 26:43.500
We're playing the knocking game.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.208
-Well, knock it off.

26:46.541 --> 26:49.250
Have you tried the Golden Stairs?

26:49.333 --> 26:51.083
Or the Three-door Guard?

26:55.291 --> 26:56.583
I'd forgotten.

26:56.666 --> 26:59.916
These wee'ns are turning my mind to mush.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.875
He was off to mine Quartz Chasm today.

27:04.916 --> 27:08.833
You know, Disa, there is no secret
worth concealing with deception.

27:10.375 --> 27:13.333
Calling a Dwarf dishonest in her own home?

27:14.083 --> 27:16.083
That's a recipe for strong gravy.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.083
If Durin is mining quartz,

27:20.166 --> 27:22.916
why would he leave
without taking his chiseling axe?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.333
And why would you prepare
his favorite meal

27:25.416 --> 27:28.583
if he's gone to a chasm
that takes two full days to descend to?

27:28.666 --> 27:31.708
Rich crone, kiss the stone
Polish your gems and gold

27:31.791 --> 27:33.291
Gerda, I'm warning you!

27:39.125 --> 27:40.916
Durin didn't bring his axe

27:41.666 --> 27:45.333
because the quartz he's mining
isn't chiseled. It is pried.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.708
I am making mole-tail stew

27:47.791 --> 27:50.875
because it needs a wee while to set
before he's home.

27:51.625 --> 27:55.625
And while it may take several days
for an outsider, such as you,

27:55.708 --> 27:57.666
Dwarven climbers like my husband

27:57.750 --> 28:01.083
can make the descent to Quartz Chasm
in just a few hours.

28:02.458 --> 28:05.250
Was there anything else
you wanted to ask about, dearie?

28:07.375 --> 28:08.541
No.

28:09.708 --> 28:10.875
Thank you.

28:20.041 --> 28:23.666
Quartz Chasm. Not bad. Not bad.

28:23.750 --> 28:27.250
I just hope he believed me.
He's not easily taken in, that Elf.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.750
Certainly not.

28:29.791 --> 28:34.041
Lucky my future queen could convince
a water rat to wear a mink coat.

28:34.125 --> 28:39.500
One more reason to count my blessings
I married you, not Margid Rustborin.

28:39.583 --> 28:41.416
And what are the other reasons?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.541
I'll tell you later.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.541
Hush now. We better keep our pipes down.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.750
Mm-hmm.

28:49.083 --> 28:51.583
We're making good progress
in the old mine.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.875
I made sure he was escorted out...

29:04.666 --> 29:08.083
The old mine
below the Mirrormere.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.416
You lost, Elf?

29:12.166 --> 29:13.125
Hmm?

29:14.083 --> 29:16.750
No. I know exactly where I'm going.

29:19.083 --> 29:20.250
-Good day.

30:15.958 --> 30:17.583
-Rich crone, kiss the stone.

30:17.666 --> 30:19.291
Polish your gems and gold.

31:02.083 --> 31:03.625
I knew it!

31:04.125 --> 31:05.166
Durin?

31:05.250 --> 31:07.541
-Came to spy on me, Elf?
-Hardly.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.125
-What is this place?

31:09.208 --> 31:12.125
You really expect me
to believe you do not know?

31:12.208 --> 31:16.041
That this was not the true reason
he sent you here to begin with?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.083
You want it for yourselves.

31:19.166 --> 31:20.750
Durin, want what?

31:22.416 --> 31:25.666
I care nothing for whatever
is in that chamber.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.208
I do care for you, for this friendship.

31:30.416 --> 31:32.125
And secrets do not become it.

31:35.125 --> 31:37.458
What is the meaning of all this? Mm?

31:41.333 --> 31:43.000
I need your oath.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.083
Hand to mountain,

31:52.166 --> 31:55.000
you'll never breathe so much as a whisper

31:55.083 --> 31:58.291
of what I'm about to tell you
to another living soul.

31:59.541 --> 32:02.125
Dwarven anger outlives even Elven memory.

32:02.208 --> 32:03.791
Break your promise,

32:04.708 --> 32:08.458
and the power of this stone
will doom you and your kin to sorrow,

32:08.541 --> 32:11.333
to your last day on this Middle-earth.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.833
Do you swear it, Elrond?

32:27.583 --> 32:31.333
I swear on the memory
of my father, Eärendil the Mariner.

32:36.166 --> 32:39.125
Anything you tell me here
will end in my ears alone.

32:45.625 --> 32:49.416
Disa detected it
during a routine gold-seaming.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.500
A new ore.

32:57.291 --> 33:00.500
Lighter than silk, harder than iron,

33:00.583 --> 33:03.750
as weaponry,
it would best our proudest blades.

33:04.666 --> 33:09.666
As specie, it might be dearer than gold.

33:10.708 --> 33:13.125
It is strange how it catches the light.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.708
Almost seems lit from within.

33:15.791 --> 33:20.208
I tell you, this could be the beginning
of a new era for our people.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.666
Strength, prosperity...

33:22.750 --> 33:25.541
Then why all the secrecy?

33:26.125 --> 33:27.541
Why not celebrate this?

33:30.333 --> 33:32.541
It's perilous to mine.

33:33.583 --> 33:37.208
My father has restricted our every efforts

33:38.000 --> 33:39.875
in the name of caution.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.625
May I?

33:51.333 --> 33:53.916
What do you call this miracle ore?

33:55.291 --> 33:57.291
In our tongue, "gray glitter."

33:57.375 --> 33:59.916
In yours, something like  mith-raud.

34:01.583 --> 34:03.333
No, no. It would be...

34:05.416 --> 34:06.541
mithril.

34:08.541 --> 34:12.500
So you really did come all this way
just for Eregion?

34:13.250 --> 34:16.125
I came because 20 years
is far too long to stay away.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.291
Even for an Elf.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.458
Oh.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.958
Keep it.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.166
Token of our friendship.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.250
Very well.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.333
No!

34:48.458 --> 34:51.500
Durin! Durin! Durin, no!

34:51.958 --> 34:53.875
There's four Dwarves down there!

34:55.666 --> 34:56.750
Durin!

35:14.333 --> 35:16.833
Eärien, floors and goblets.

35:19.791 --> 35:21.041
-Ooh!
-Oh!

35:21.666 --> 35:22.791
I'm so sorry.

35:22.875 --> 35:26.375
It's all right. It's all right.
It's... It's... It's all right, honestly.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.333
And here I thought your talents
ended at draftsmanship.

35:29.833 --> 35:32.083
Scrubbing is good for dexterity.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.375
Or so the guild master says.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.708
So, how about this?
I'll do the floors, you do the goblets.

35:38.791 --> 35:40.666
And the last one to finish
pays for dinner.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.750
I'm not in the habit of going off
with strange young men.

35:42.833 --> 35:45.750
Very wise. If I see any,
you'll be the first to know.

36:12.250 --> 36:15.916
As much as I admire your habit of charging
at every obstacle in your path,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.291
like a colt in full gallop...

36:19.583 --> 36:23.833
Has it ever occurred to you
that you're not battling trolls or Orcs,

36:23.916 --> 36:24.875
but Men?

36:25.375 --> 36:28.041
Are you really about to advise me
in the art of war?

36:28.125 --> 36:30.541
No. No, I...

36:30.666 --> 36:33.875
I wouldn't dare. But then...

36:34.791 --> 36:39.416
The queen's court isn't exactly
your usual battlefield, is it?

36:42.083 --> 36:43.250
Go on.

36:44.666 --> 36:47.666
In an instance like this, it seems to me

36:47.750 --> 36:52.166
that you'd do well to identify what it is
that your opponent most fears.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.541
-And exploit it?
-No.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.666
Give them a means of mastering it.

36:59.791 --> 37:02.375
So that you can master them.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.583
So by your standards, I'm in this cell,

37:04.666 --> 37:07.125
because I've yet to identify
what the queen most fears?

37:07.208 --> 37:08.875
My very low standards. Yes.

37:08.958 --> 37:11.666
And I suppose you did,
having met her for all of a few moments?

37:11.750 --> 37:16.500
During which you managed to demand a ship,
insult her people, defy her orders,

37:16.583 --> 37:18.291
none of which quickened her pulse.

37:19.333 --> 37:22.166
Now, all of a sudden,
she throws you in a cell.

37:24.125 --> 37:24.958
Why?

37:25.333 --> 37:27.541
I asked her to fight for your people.

37:27.625 --> 37:30.791
But that wasn't what provoked her anger,
was it?

37:33.333 --> 37:35.500
I demanded to speak with her father.

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
The king in the tower,
whom no one has seen in years.

37:43.875 --> 37:48.458
See what happens when you stop galloping
and you give yourself a moment to think?

37:48.541 --> 37:50.166
Cease comparing me to a horse.

37:50.250 --> 37:53.125
Cease trying to convince me
to leave this island an you have a deal.

37:53.208 --> 37:54.625
Salutations, Elf.

37:54.708 --> 37:57.416
The Queen Regent
has rendered her decision.

37:58.375 --> 38:02.791
You are to be shipped back to the Elves
under armed escort. Tonight.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.000
Step forward.

38:32.916 --> 38:35.250
-I wouldn't advise that.
-I can't very well let her leave.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.000
-You could.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.875
If you knew exactly where she was going.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.500
What are you doing up here?

39:03.583 --> 39:05.000
I had a dinner.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.000
Who is he?

39:10.458 --> 39:12.291
Where's your uniform?

39:15.291 --> 39:17.500
Resigned from the cadets, did you?

39:18.333 --> 39:19.750
No, worse.

39:19.833 --> 39:21.333
You got dismissed?

39:22.416 --> 39:23.750
Got us all dismissed.

39:23.833 --> 39:25.083
Isil...

39:28.791 --> 39:32.458
Well, you've won. Now you can go west.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.375
I just ruined my friends' lives,

39:38.916 --> 39:40.500
shamed our family name.

39:42.291 --> 39:43.958
I don't deserve to go west.

39:47.666 --> 39:50.250
-Plus, Father won't let me take Berek.

39:55.666 --> 39:57.750
It's the Elf! She's escaped.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.541
Search every alley.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.500
Apologies, Your Majesty,
for the intrusion. But I...

40:22.583 --> 40:24.291
He no longer answers to that.

40:32.041 --> 40:33.875
How did you know I would come here?

40:33.958 --> 40:37.625
A garrison of troops awaits outside
to escort you to your ship.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.916
You would be wise to go willingly.

40:41.791 --> 40:43.500
Míriel.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.208
Míriel.

41:00.750 --> 41:01.750
I... I...

41:01.833 --> 41:04.416
-It's all right, Father. I'm here.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.333
Forgive me.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.375
I did not know.

41:13.458 --> 41:15.875
Few know the full extent of his decline.

41:18.125 --> 41:20.125
I should like to keep it that way.

41:20.791 --> 41:23.208
Then it is time for truth between us.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.666
Your father was loyal to the Elvish ways.

41:29.625 --> 41:31.041
Why are you not?

41:32.208 --> 41:33.541
Tell me.

41:35.875 --> 41:37.125
Please.

41:39.458 --> 41:42.166
My father was always restrained
in his beliefs.

41:43.250 --> 41:46.125
But after his coronation,
something changed.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.375
He became strident,

41:50.458 --> 41:54.125
proclaiming that we'd provoked
the anger of the Valar,

41:54.208 --> 41:57.875
and must repent,
and return to the old ways.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.125
There was unease.

42:02.166 --> 42:05.875
And when he announced plans
to renew relations with the Elves...

42:05.958 --> 42:07.375
The people rebelled.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.583
Much was lost.

42:14.708 --> 42:17.041
I was chosen to rule in his stead,

42:18.208 --> 42:20.250
with a promise to quell the storm.

42:21.708 --> 42:25.833
But that first night,
as all Númenor slept,

42:25.916 --> 42:27.583
he brought me here.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.208
Palantír.

42:35.208 --> 42:37.666
Seven Seeing Stones there once were.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.916
The other six either lost or hidden.

42:41.916 --> 42:43.958
This one was passed to my father.

42:44.791 --> 42:46.666
And with it, a secret.

42:49.583 --> 42:51.208
Place your hand upon it.

42:54.583 --> 42:57.666
-I must warn you...
-I have touched  palantíri  before.

42:57.750 --> 42:59.750
But you have not touched this one.

43:28.875 --> 43:30.708
It is Númenor's future you saw.

43:34.833 --> 43:36.833
Palantíri  show many visions.

43:37.750 --> 43:39.750
Some that will never come to pass.

43:39.833 --> 43:41.625
It has already come to pass.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.666
The vision begins with your arrival.

43:45.333 --> 43:48.333
And you believe I will bring about
Númenor's downfall?

43:48.416 --> 43:51.000
Only Númenor can bring about her downfall.

43:52.250 --> 43:55.083
The Valar gifted us this isle
in a day of virtue.

43:55.166 --> 43:58.791
They can take it away should we turn
to the paths of darkness.

43:58.875 --> 44:02.833
The virtue you speak of
was your ancestors' loyalty to the Elves.

44:02.916 --> 44:04.916
My father believed that.

44:05.916 --> 44:07.916
His path nearly destroyed us.

44:09.500 --> 44:13.000
That is why, tomorrow,
I will announce that you are gone.

44:13.791 --> 44:15.208
And this crisis ended.

44:18.208 --> 44:21.166
If the evil rising in Middle-earth
is left unchecked,

44:21.250 --> 44:23.916
it will spread and take us all.

44:24.416 --> 44:27.708
Avoiding this war may be the very thing
that brings about your downfall.

44:27.791 --> 44:31.083
I will not second-guess the gods.
My decision is final.

44:31.166 --> 44:32.958
A decision based in fear.

44:34.791 --> 44:38.333
I know what it is to be the only one,

44:40.375 --> 44:42.208
the only one who sees,

44:42.958 --> 44:44.791
the only one who knows.

44:46.041 --> 44:49.791
Perhaps neither of us have
to bear that burden alone any longer.

44:50.250 --> 44:54.583
I beg of you, Míriel,
choose not the path of fear,

44:54.666 --> 44:56.250
but that of faith.

44:56.875 --> 44:58.375
Stand with me.

44:59.125 --> 45:02.083
Let Númenor fight
alongside the Elves once more.

45:11.958 --> 45:15.375
Faith may bind one heart, Galadriel.

45:16.166 --> 45:19.500
But it is too fine a thread
from which to hang a kingdom.

45:22.250 --> 45:23.458
I'm sorry.

45:30.166 --> 45:34.083
Woods are all bare. Animals are all fled.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.916
Seems your boy had more sense
than we allowed.

45:38.833 --> 45:40.583
-There's someone at the gates!

45:45.500 --> 45:46.750
Stand back.

45:46.833 --> 45:49.500
-Move out of the way. Stand back!
-Let the lad through!

45:51.375 --> 45:53.125
There's plenty. Slow down!

45:53.208 --> 45:55.583
Rowan! Where's Theo?

45:57.083 --> 45:58.833
He said he'd be right behind me.

45:58.916 --> 46:00.458
-I'm so hungry!
-Stop pushing!

46:00.541 --> 46:01.750
She pushed me!

46:04.375 --> 46:06.875
We've turned over every stone.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.250
He ain't back here.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.708
-Come on.

46:14.708 --> 46:15.791
Where is he?

46:18.458 --> 46:19.750
He's not here!

46:23.541 --> 46:24.375
Let's go.

46:27.291 --> 46:29.541
Leave no stone unturned.

46:32.708 --> 46:35.291
Boss will skin us alive
if we don't find him.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.166
Boss is the one who lost him
in the first place.

46:38.250 --> 46:40.708
Izmûmbogh...

46:43.458 --> 46:44.750
Come on!

46:48.375 --> 46:51.166
Kishdibatoth! Kishdibatoth.

47:04.291 --> 47:05.750
Kishdibatoth.

47:11.333 --> 47:12.416
Find him!

47:22.958 --> 47:24.250
Nothin' here.

47:35.916 --> 47:38.083
-Over there! Look!

48:00.166 --> 48:02.125
Going somewhere,
young blood, are we?

48:03.166 --> 48:04.250
Where is it?

48:04.333 --> 48:05.333
No!

48:05.416 --> 48:07.750
Where have you got it?

48:08.666 --> 48:12.375
Maybe losing your arm
will loosen your lips.

48:24.041 --> 48:26.208
-Swiftly, lad.
-Over there! Get him!

48:27.000 --> 48:28.333
They are coming.

48:53.333 --> 48:54.333
Keep going.

49:20.791 --> 49:21.791
Run!

49:36.291 --> 49:37.458
Mother?

49:38.958 --> 49:40.125
Bronwyn.

49:43.833 --> 49:45.708
Run! Get to the clearing!

52:12.125 --> 52:14.333
What was that?

52:14.875 --> 52:17.500
It was a plea to the rocks

52:17.583 --> 52:21.500
to release the bodies of the miners
with breath still inside them.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.958
I cannot stop thinking
that if you'd not gone down there,

52:27.125 --> 52:29.791
Durin might have been
in that shaft when it...

52:31.375 --> 52:32.458
I'm sorry.

52:33.166 --> 52:34.666
I'm sorry I lied to you.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.208
You were faithful to my friend.

52:36.291 --> 52:38.375
-That is all we need remember.

52:40.541 --> 52:42.583
They just pulled out the last one.

52:44.416 --> 52:47.375
-Alive. All of them alive.

52:48.333 --> 52:50.250
Your father must be so relieved.

52:50.333 --> 52:51.750
He shut it down.

52:53.208 --> 52:56.125
The whole vein is to be sealed off.

52:56.208 --> 52:58.125
-The whole vein?
-All of it.

52:59.041 --> 53:00.500
Give him time.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.000
Even the hottest coals eventually cool.

53:04.083 --> 53:06.500
Yeah, but sometimes I wish they wouldn't.

53:07.750 --> 53:11.375
Sometimes I wish I could tell him
exactly what I think of him,

53:12.375 --> 53:16.958
and never trade words
with the old goat again!

53:41.250 --> 53:44.041
My father single-handedly
sailed to Valinor,

53:45.250 --> 53:49.875
and convinced the Valar to join the war
and vanquish Morgoth.

53:51.166 --> 53:53.208
So great were his deeds

53:53.291 --> 53:56.375
that the Valar lifted him
beyond the bounds of this world...

53:57.625 --> 54:00.333
To forever carry the Evening Star
across the sky.

54:03.666 --> 54:06.416
For many years, at day's end,
I would look up at it...

54:08.166 --> 54:13.208
Wondering what might he think
if he were watching me.

54:15.125 --> 54:18.125
Would he be proud
of what I've accomplished with his legacy?

54:20.708 --> 54:26.291
Or disappointed by the countless ways
I'd failed to live up to it?

54:31.250 --> 54:34.041
But then, one night, it struck me

54:34.125 --> 54:37.083
that I would be only too happy
to hear any judgment,

54:37.166 --> 54:39.416
so long as it granted me the opportunity

54:39.500 --> 54:41.958
to have but one more conversation
with my father.

54:43.833 --> 54:47.833
Do not waste
what time you have left with yours.

54:57.666 --> 55:01.875
Elrond, I was hopeful you might be able
to settle something.

55:02.666 --> 55:05.166
How is it that you and my husband met?

55:05.250 --> 55:07.833
I told you, I saved him from a hill-troll.

55:07.916 --> 55:10.250
-Two of 'em.
-Two of 'em. Yes, I know.

55:10.333 --> 55:11.333
Mmm-hmm.

55:11.791 --> 55:13.333
I was asking Elrond.

55:13.750 --> 55:15.291
Then I fear I have no choice

55:15.375 --> 55:17.750
-but to amend your husband's account.

55:17.833 --> 55:20.125
There were three trolls.
And it was I who saved him.

55:20.208 --> 55:24.083
You wouldn't remember your face
if you were gazing in a mirror.

55:24.166 --> 55:25.916
When I came upon him
in the forest,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.250
he was in the midst
of dodging their mallet blows.

55:28.333 --> 55:31.250
-Wailing and screaming and such.
-It was a battle cry.

55:31.333 --> 55:34.125
The screams were so high-pitched,
I thought it was a child.

55:34.208 --> 55:35.041
So I took up my bow...

55:35.125 --> 55:36.625
-Uh, it was a sword.
-It was a bow.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.041
-Nah! It was a sword!
-Regardless...

55:45.500 --> 55:46.750
Forgive me, Father.

55:47.541 --> 55:52.083
I was proud and stubborn and I was wrong.

55:57.666 --> 55:59.458
Can you not even look at me?

56:11.208 --> 56:13.208
Our people believe...

56:14.708 --> 56:17.416
That when a new Dwarf-king is crowned,

56:18.666 --> 56:22.041
the voices of all his forebearers
flow into him,

56:24.416 --> 56:26.666
sharing with him their counsel

56:27.583 --> 56:29.000
and wisdom.

56:30.750 --> 56:33.208
-Even their mistakes.

56:39.083 --> 56:40.500
But you...

56:42.583 --> 56:45.833
You need not wait for that day
to hear my voice.

56:50.583 --> 56:55.166
For, ever am I with you, my son.

56:58.833 --> 57:00.083
Even in anger.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.958
Sometimes, in anger most of all.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.458
There is nothing to forgive.

57:26.500 --> 57:31.250
Elrond has invited me
to go with him to Lindon tomorrow.

57:36.291 --> 57:37.625
Shall I accept?

57:39.541 --> 57:42.375
Elrond has been very convincing
in his assurances

57:42.458 --> 57:45.791
that Gil-galad bore no ill intent
when he sent him here.

57:45.875 --> 57:49.166
Aye. He has.

57:50.291 --> 57:52.541
But intuition's a powerful tonic.

57:54.041 --> 57:55.541
What does yours tell you?

57:56.791 --> 57:58.833
There is something more at work.

57:58.916 --> 58:00.000
Good, my son.

58:01.041 --> 58:02.208
Good.

58:04.041 --> 58:05.375
Go to Lindon.

58:06.791 --> 58:08.125
Find out what.

58:24.916 --> 58:26.083
Thank you.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.416
What is it? What's wrong?

58:38.958 --> 58:43.291
I have a message.
From the one who commands our enemy.

58:46.083 --> 58:50.083
That your people may live
if you forsake all claim to these lands...

58:51.666 --> 58:53.083
And swear fealty to him.

58:55.500 --> 58:56.916
And if we refuse?

58:58.416 --> 58:59.916
He's coming for Ostirith.

59:39.041 --> 59:41.083
-Come on.

59:45.875 --> 59:48.875
If you ask me, you deserve a nip
of mash after what you done.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.000
Go on, take it.

59:52.583 --> 59:56.666
Just like you took that hilt from me barn.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.458
Uh... I don't know what...

59:58.541 --> 1:00:00.041
Come off it, lad.

1:00:00.750 --> 1:00:02.583
You know of what I speak.

1:00:14.083 --> 1:00:17.541
Do you know what it is? It is no sword.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.416
It is a power.

1:00:20.291 --> 1:00:24.791
Fashioned for our ancestors
by his master's own hand.

1:00:25.291 --> 1:00:27.833
A beautiful servant.

1:00:27.916 --> 1:00:31.500
He who was lost, but shall return.

1:00:33.041 --> 1:00:34.791
Have you heard of him, lad?

1:00:35.750 --> 1:00:37.250
Have you heard of Sauron?

1:00:41.916 --> 1:00:43.750
You must have seen it in the skies.

1:00:44.875 --> 1:00:46.458
A few weeks back now.

1:00:47.541 --> 1:00:48.791
The starfall.

1:00:48.875 --> 1:00:50.708
It means his time is near.

1:00:51.833 --> 1:00:55.666
And it is to you and me, lad, to be ready.

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:57.125
Ready for what?

1:00:57.208 --> 1:00:59.500
Hush now, lad.

1:01:00.416 --> 1:01:02.250
You save your strength.

1:01:03.583 --> 1:01:05.000
You'll need it.

1:01:06.625 --> 1:01:08.041
For what's coming.

1:01:22.833 --> 1:01:24.416
Lord-father...

1:01:26.125 --> 1:01:27.625
We found it.

1:01:29.375 --> 1:01:31.208
It's in the tower.

1:01:56.458 --> 1:01:58.250
Go in peace.

1:02:41.791 --> 1:02:43.708
Your people will be relieved.

1:02:44.541 --> 1:02:46.458
They will be gathering soon in the court,

1:02:46.541 --> 1:02:48.708
and in the plaza,
to hear your announcement.

1:02:52.041 --> 1:02:54.041
Then we ought not to keep them.

1:04:05.791 --> 1:04:09.166
The faithful believe that
when the petals of the White Tree fall

1:04:09.250 --> 1:04:11.000
it is no idle thing,

1:04:11.083 --> 1:04:13.958
but the very tears
of the Valar themselves,

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:19.250
a living reminder that their eyes
and their judgment are ever upon us.

1:04:20.458 --> 1:04:23.875
There is a fateful hour
in the destinies of men.

1:04:24.541 --> 1:04:25.791
An hour of judgment

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:31.166
in which each of us, every one,

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.250
must decide who we shall be.

1:04:36.208 --> 1:04:40.500
Are our hearts become
as the statues that surround our isle?

1:04:40.958 --> 1:04:44.833
Or do they yet beat with the blood
of the heroes that carved them?

1:04:48.166 --> 1:04:51.375
Is our valor confined to the graves
of our slumbering fathers?

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:54.875
Or is it here,

1:04:56.791 --> 1:04:58.583
amongst us even now...

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.416
Waiting to burst forth as the rising Sun?

1:05:11.458 --> 1:05:16.750
I would neither command, nor invite you
to any danger I myself would not face.

1:05:17.541 --> 1:05:22.166
And so, I've decided to personally
escort the Elf back to Middle-earth.

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:34.458
To aid our mortal brethren
who are now besieged in the Southlands.

1:05:35.166 --> 1:05:37.208
Your queen
has laid bare her intent.

1:05:37.291 --> 1:05:39.500
Our ships will depart in ten days.

1:05:40.708 --> 1:05:45.250
The expeditionary force will be made up
of brave sons and daughters

1:05:45.333 --> 1:05:47.541
from across fair Númenor.

1:05:48.375 --> 1:05:52.875
Who is willing to commit themselves
to our Queen Regent's protection?

1:05:58.833 --> 1:06:01.666
Step forward and make yourself known.

1:06:04.166 --> 1:06:05.458
I will serve.

1:06:09.916 --> 1:06:11.208
I will serve.

1:06:14.125 --> 1:06:15.541
I will serve.

1:06:22.666 --> 1:06:23.500
I will serve!

1:06:25.916 --> 1:06:26.750
I will serve!
