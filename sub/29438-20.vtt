- Our relationship,

00:03.806 --> 00:06.139
it is perfect just like this.

00:06.141 --> 00:07.446
He'll be a vegetable.

00:07.448 --> 00:09.394
It's the compassionate
choice at this point.

00:09.396 --> 00:10.993
Are you suggesting we let him die?

00:10.995 --> 00:13.420
Nobody, and I mean <i>
nobody,</i> dies in my OR!

00:13.422 --> 00:14.722
<i>DEVON: This is Dawn Long.</i>

00:14.724 --> 00:16.406
<i>NIC: She's been in
LTACH this whole time?</i>

00:16.408 --> 00:18.017
Dawn Long had <i> Candida auris.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:19.708
<i>Anybody who'd come into contat</i>

00:19.710 --> 00:21.929

KIM: If it gets out now
that we have a deadly fungus,

00:24.100 --> 00:25.547
this hospital goes bankrupt.

00:25.549 --> 00:27.201
<i>CAIN: Has this vent been
used in the last 24 hours?</i>

00:27.203 --> 00:29.154
<i>SUPERVISOR: It's been down here</i>
for the decontamination process.

00:29.156 --> 00:32.055
- Clean it now.
- Lunch. Half hour.

00:32.057 --> 00:34.441
Daddy's still very sick?

00:34.443 --> 00:35.685
He's fighting to get better.

00:35.687 --> 00:38.334
They want to put you on a
ventilator to help you breathe.

00:38.336 --> 00:39.927
JOSIE: Sleep tight, Daddy.

00:45.529 --> 00:47.454
- Thank you.
- There you go.

00:47.456 --> 00:49.382
Hey. How was that?

00:49.384 --> 00:50.958
(SIGHS) Intrusive.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.460
They're swabbing armpit and groin.

00:53.462 --> 00:55.683
Humiliating but necessary.

00:55.685 --> 00:57.417
You don't need a mask, Zorro.

00:57.419 --> 00:59.541
This is <i> Candida auris,</i> not coronavirus.

00:59.543 --> 01:01.418
It travels on skin and equipment.

01:01.420 --> 01:02.660
It isn't airborne.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.156
And you're scaring people.

01:05.158 --> 01:06.670
Shouldn't they be scared?

01:06.672 --> 01:08.125
DEVON: No. We've contacted

01:08.127 --> 01:10.569
the health department, and it
is all being handled properly.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.239
And why are you here, anyway?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.223
Only people who have been in contact

01:15.225 --> 01:17.218
with infected patients
need to be swabbed.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.563
Can never be too safe.

01:19.565 --> 01:20.832
Excuse me.

01:25.661 --> 01:26.994
Where are we?

01:26.996 --> 01:29.797
We think the fungus has been contained.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.642
<i>Think</i> but don't know for certain.

01:31.644 --> 01:33.050
Randolph, do you think

01:33.052 --> 01:34.793
we should have Derek
transferred to Atlanta General?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.128
- I really don't think that that's necessary.
- Well,

01:36.130 --> 01:38.553
all his doctors are at Chastain.
His chemo protocol

01:38.555 --> 01:40.332
is here. And, Kit, we're
taking every precaution.

01:40.334 --> 01:43.319
Plus, Derek had zero crosses
with the infected patients.

01:43.321 --> 01:46.405
Okay, but if there's any
sign that this is spreading...

01:48.517 --> 01:50.576
- ... I want him out.
- Agreed.

01:51.355 --> 01:52.904
So, you fell while salsa dancing?

01:52.906 --> 01:55.699
- Yeah.
- And took down a table full of mojitos.

01:55.701 --> 01:57.534
- Ouch.
- MERCEDES: I wanted to bring him in

01:57.536 --> 02:00.197
last night, but he swore he was fine.

02:00.199 --> 02:01.797
I <i> am</i> fine.

02:01.799 --> 02:04.207
I just lost my balance
during that final spin.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.893
- Follow my finger.
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.895 --> 02:07.878
MERCEDES: You don't lose
your balance, Miguel.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.920
He's the 2003 Salsa Planet champion.

02:09.923 --> 02:11.473
- Did you know that?
- And 2002.

02:11.475 --> 02:13.346
- Back-to-back, baby. (CHUCKLES)
- Impressive.

02:13.348 --> 02:14.735
You still compete?

02:14.737 --> 02:16.904
(SIGHS) Now I teach. Oh.

02:18.098 --> 02:19.907
First lesson is free at my studio.

02:19.909 --> 02:22.392
I love salsa. Thank you.

02:22.394 --> 02:25.103
Uh, Miguel, will you
unbutton your shirt for me?

02:25.105 --> 02:27.039
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

02:31.737 --> 02:33.754
Is that a pacemaker?

02:33.756 --> 02:36.832
No, it's a, uh, it's a defibrillator.

02:36.834 --> 02:39.335
What's that for, hon?

02:39.337 --> 02:40.905
It's nothing to worry about, <i>corazón.</i>

02:40.907 --> 02:42.120
It's probably broken, anyway.

02:42.122 --> 02:43.431
Is that why you fell?

02:43.433 --> 02:44.640
Because it shocked you?

02:45.584 --> 02:46.767
Maybe.

02:46.769 --> 02:49.127
Okay. So it sounds
like either your heart

02:49.129 --> 02:51.314
or your defibrillator
needs some attention.

02:57.971 --> 03:00.138
Am I allowed to be happy?

03:00.140 --> 03:01.641
Chemo's working.

03:01.643 --> 03:04.035
- The tumor's shrinking, Kit.
- Thank you.

03:04.872 --> 03:06.695
We waited for you, Mom.

03:06.697 --> 03:08.080
We're ready to extubate.

03:09.033 --> 03:11.483
I love your dress.

03:11.485 --> 03:13.958
- (CHUCKLES)
- Daddy gave it to me.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.482
Well, your daddy's recovery is amazing.

03:16.484 --> 03:18.192
Well, he's got a lot to live for.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.934
(COUGHING)

03:33.149 --> 03:36.508
- MOLLY: Hi, honey.
- Do you like my dress, Daddy?

03:36.510 --> 03:40.029
Oh, it's gonna take him a minute
for him to wake up, sweetie.

03:41.265 --> 03:43.824
I've got so many things to tell you.

03:43.826 --> 03:45.856
Sarah's dog is having puppies,

03:45.858 --> 03:47.903
and Mom said we could adopt one, maybe.

03:47.905 --> 03:49.789
(MOLLY AND DEREK CHUCKLE)

03:50.833 --> 03:52.649
MOLLY: Hi, there.

03:52.651 --> 03:56.046
Welcome back. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

03:56.048 --> 03:58.572
You don't have to answer the
thing about the puppy right now.

03:58.574 --> 04:00.699
How do you feel?

04:00.701 --> 04:02.993
I can't see.

04:02.995 --> 04:06.922
Molly, I can't see. I can't see.

04:06.924 --> 04:09.708
- What's going on, Mom?
- I don't know.

04:09.710 --> 04:12.594
Can you see anything at all?

04:12.596 --> 04:14.188
Nope. Nothing.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.716
KIT: What's happening?

04:17.718 --> 04:19.009
Could it be the cancer?

04:19.011 --> 04:21.678
A-a brain bleed while he was sedated?

04:21.680 --> 04:24.723
We're gonna get him
a head CT immediately,

04:24.725 --> 04:26.075
and figure out what this is.

04:27.561 --> 04:29.203
(WHISPERS): It's okay.

04:42.868 --> 04:45.556
I don't even really like popcorn.

04:45.558 --> 04:47.438
Well, who doesn't love butter and salt?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.134
Truth. Which is why, when I was starving

04:50.136 --> 04:51.849
and my options were vending machine

04:51.851 --> 04:54.228
or a dumpster dive, I bought a bag.

04:54.230 --> 04:58.335
Basically inhaled it and somehow
got a kernel stuck in my molar.

04:58.337 --> 04:59.900
And you tried to remove it

04:59.902 --> 05:02.740
- with a paper clip?
- I mean, that wasn't my first play.

05:02.742 --> 05:04.471
I did try a toothpick like a human.

05:04.473 --> 05:06.448
Uh, brushing, flossing,

05:06.450 --> 05:08.767
and then my fingernails
when I got desperate.

05:08.769 --> 05:10.894
But then I guess I just...

05:10.896 --> 05:12.229
got used to it.

05:12.231 --> 05:14.388
I figured it would eventually
come out on its own.

05:14.390 --> 05:16.750
Well, let's make sure
it's nothing serious.

05:16.752 --> 05:19.485
How long have you been
experiencing jaw pain?

05:19.487 --> 05:21.010
A few weeks.

05:21.012 --> 05:23.752
I know, I know. I should've
gone to the dentist.

05:23.754 --> 05:25.926
But I'm only working with
basic health insurance

05:25.928 --> 05:29.412
and a public radio salary here.

05:29.414 --> 05:31.765
And I have my son's tuition to pay.

05:31.767 --> 05:33.291
So, when I woke up this morning,

05:33.293 --> 05:34.918
it was like I was
being stabbed in the...

05:34.920 --> 05:36.845
Justine?

05:36.847 --> 05:37.963
I need some help over here.

05:37.965 --> 05:39.148
Grab her legs.

05:42.278 --> 05:44.094
Tilt your head toward me.

05:44.096 --> 05:46.030
Going in slowly.

05:48.976 --> 05:50.025
You see that?

05:50.027 --> 05:52.119
CONRAD: White lesions.

05:53.789 --> 05:54.847
So I didn't have a stroke?

05:54.849 --> 05:56.679
CONRAD: No. The CT confirmed that.

05:56.681 --> 05:58.778
And it doesn't look like cancer, either.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.151
Then why can't I see?

06:00.153 --> 06:04.798
You have an infection in your eyes.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.594
Okay. So we can fix this,
right? And he'll see again.

06:14.882 --> 06:16.554
I'll be right back.

06:16.556 --> 06:17.664
We can talk more

06:17.666 --> 06:20.481
after the eye doctor finishes his exam.

06:20.483 --> 06:22.358
Hang in there.

06:23.802 --> 06:25.954
DEVON: Okay...

06:25.956 --> 06:27.979
so all the tests from the hospital staff

06:27.981 --> 06:30.081
and the patients have come back;
no one else has been colonized.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.648
So it can't be <i> Candida auris.</i>

06:31.650 --> 06:33.928
The labs will confirm
that one way or another,

06:33.930 --> 06:36.521
but let's get him on contact
precautions just in case.

06:36.523 --> 06:38.614
Gowns and gloves for
anyone who enters his room.

06:38.616 --> 06:40.288
And if he does have it, what's next?

06:40.290 --> 06:42.485
Fevers. His blood pressure drops...

06:42.487 --> 06:45.231
Sophia died within a
day of being diagnosed.

06:45.233 --> 06:47.866
Be straight with me. Is
that what we're looking at?

06:47.868 --> 06:51.337
It is a pan-resistant strain of <i> candida.</i>

06:51.339 --> 06:52.695
And we don't have the
medicine to treat it.

06:52.697 --> 06:54.219
Let's focus on what we can do.

06:54.221 --> 06:56.091
CONRAD: Yeah, let's start him on GCSF.

06:56.093 --> 06:59.200
Jump-start his immune system,
trend his labs every six hours,

06:59.202 --> 07:01.379
and watch his blood
pressure like a hawk.

07:01.381 --> 07:02.547
Did you learn something?

07:02.549 --> 07:04.840
Molly...

07:04.842 --> 07:06.935
until we know what
we're dealing with here,

07:06.937 --> 07:09.029
it's best Josie doesn't go in the room.

07:09.031 --> 07:11.122
- JOSIE: Grandma?
- Okay, what's going on?

07:11.124 --> 07:12.481
- Grandma.
- Yes?

07:12.483 --> 07:13.981
Do you have any more of these?

07:13.983 --> 07:15.691
They're really pretty.

07:18.902 --> 07:19.902
Hey...

07:21.877 --> 07:24.545
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:24.547 --> 07:26.696
This is Dawn Long's vent.

07:26.698 --> 07:28.531
Her daughter put that sticker on it.

07:28.533 --> 07:31.743
You mean, if it wasn't
properly cleaned...

07:31.745 --> 07:33.745
CONRAD: Kit, if that's
true, Derek probably

07:33.747 --> 07:35.764
got <i> Candida auris</i> from that vent.

07:41.096 --> 07:44.306
And now Michelle has a cold,
so I have an extra ticket

07:44.308 --> 07:45.715
to my friend's show at The Loft.

07:45.717 --> 07:47.592
Be my plus-one.

07:47.594 --> 07:51.763
Oh, I'd love to, but it's
my folks' 45th anniversary.

07:51.765 --> 07:53.982
- Mm.
- I'm sure Torres would love to roll.

07:53.984 --> 07:56.059
Eh, pass.

07:56.061 --> 07:57.394
- Really?
- (CHUCKLES)

07:57.396 --> 07:59.062
He showed so much promise.

07:59.064 --> 08:02.249
Fleeting attraction. You know how it is.

08:06.163 --> 08:08.738
45 years of marriage. Wow.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.782
Yeah. You know what?

08:10.784 --> 08:13.952
They still love each other
like it was the first day.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.597
Huh. Something to aspire to.

08:16.599 --> 08:17.671
Hmm.

08:17.673 --> 08:19.812
I didn't want it in
me in the first place.

08:19.814 --> 08:21.510
I feel strong as an ox.

08:21.512 --> 08:24.054
For God's sake, I'm only 55.

08:24.056 --> 08:27.991
Mr. Espinoza, I am Dr. Austin.

08:27.993 --> 08:29.850
This is Dr. Okafor.

08:29.852 --> 08:32.293
We're gonna see what's
going on with this ICD, okay?

08:32.294 --> 08:34.806
Probably shocked me by mistake.

08:34.808 --> 08:37.475
I went in for a physical,
three, four months ago.

08:37.477 --> 08:39.477
My doctor saw my swollen feet.

08:39.479 --> 08:42.030
Of course they swell. I dance.

08:42.032 --> 08:45.033
But he told me I had heart failure.

08:45.035 --> 08:46.868
I still don't believe it.

08:46.870 --> 08:48.366
My heart has never failed.

08:48.368 --> 08:51.161
Except it did.

08:52.841 --> 08:54.388
Are you sure?

08:54.390 --> 08:56.389
Yeah, we are.

08:56.391 --> 08:58.880
Would you like us to get your wife

08:58.882 --> 09:00.498
before we talk more?

09:00.500 --> 09:03.290
- I don't have a wife.
- Your girlfriend?

09:03.292 --> 09:04.957
The woman who was with you in the ER?

09:04.959 --> 09:06.412
Probably home with her husband.

09:07.558 --> 09:09.650
Just tell me what I need to know.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.970
Oh, Miguel,

09:13.972 --> 09:16.801
your device worked
exactly as it should have.

09:16.803 --> 09:19.118
Your heart went into a deadly rhythm

09:19.119 --> 09:20.235
while you were dancing,

09:20.237 --> 09:22.663
and your ICD shocked you back to life.

09:22.665 --> 09:26.524
You're saying without it...

09:26.526 --> 09:28.026
I might have died?

09:28.028 --> 09:29.028
Yes.

09:31.698 --> 09:33.087
Well, will this happen again?

09:33.089 --> 09:35.509
Well, your heart is functioning at 25%,

09:35.511 --> 09:37.327
so it's very likely it will happen

09:37.329 --> 09:38.554
when you exert yourself.

09:41.016 --> 09:42.599
Like when I'm dancing.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.212
Salsa is my life.

09:47.214 --> 09:48.939
My livelihood.

09:51.551 --> 09:53.360
I don't know how to do anything else.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.556
Tell you what.

09:58.558 --> 10:00.016
When we get your tests back,

10:00.018 --> 10:02.185
Dr. Okafor and I will review them

10:02.187 --> 10:05.497
and see if there's
anything more we can do.

10:08.902 --> 10:10.836
(INDISTINCT VOICE OVER P.A.)

10:21.390 --> 10:23.373
How's Josie?

10:23.375 --> 10:25.208
She didn't want to leave.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.561
But the sitter took her
to the children's museum,

10:27.563 --> 10:30.178
so that will help.

10:30.180 --> 10:31.231
Any news?

10:31.233 --> 10:33.141
The cultures came back,

10:33.143 --> 10:35.811
and Derek has what we suspected.

10:35.813 --> 10:38.502
A <i> Candida auris</i> bloodstream infection

10:38.504 --> 10:39.889
that traveled to his eyes.

10:39.891 --> 10:43.393
- So we're starting him on antifungals?
- Yes.

10:43.395 --> 10:47.332
But it's a drug-resistant strain, Molly.

10:47.334 --> 10:50.525
Our existing medications are
likely impotent against it.

10:50.527 --> 10:53.328
- And his immune system is so weak...
- No.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.170
No, he can't get better one minute

10:55.172 --> 10:56.499
and have no hope the next.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.623
There's got to be something
we're not thinking of.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.060
Conrad is working with
our infectious disease team

11:01.062 --> 11:02.837
to see if there's anything we can try.

11:02.839 --> 11:04.172
DEREK: I'm...

11:04.174 --> 11:05.674
really hot.

11:05.676 --> 11:07.584
I don't feel right at all.

11:07.586 --> 11:09.961
Your fever's spiking.

11:09.963 --> 11:12.231
We'll get you some acetaminophen.

11:15.260 --> 11:18.687
- He's getting worse.
- (PAGER BEEPING)

11:18.689 --> 11:20.781
That's Conrad now.

11:20.783 --> 11:23.408
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

11:26.104 --> 11:28.789
Christy, he needs some acetaminophen.

11:28.791 --> 11:30.791
Right away.

11:44.306 --> 11:46.956
How do you feel?

11:46.958 --> 11:48.917
Excuse me?

11:48.919 --> 11:52.721
My son-in-law is blind
because of <i> Candida auris,</i>

11:52.723 --> 11:54.839
and it's probably going to kill him.

11:54.841 --> 11:57.559
So, again, how do you feel?

11:57.561 --> 11:59.895
I had nothing to do with that.

11:59.897 --> 12:01.971
You had everything to do with it.

12:01.973 --> 12:03.991
You knew your patient
had a deadly fungus,

12:03.993 --> 12:05.826
and you covered it up
to save your own skin.

12:05.828 --> 12:07.402
But not well enough.

12:07.404 --> 12:09.361
Dawn's vent wasn't properly cleaned

12:09.363 --> 12:11.481
and that vent went to Derek.

12:11.483 --> 12:13.650
I gave specific instructions
to sterilize her room

12:13.652 --> 12:14.835
and all the equipment.

12:14.837 --> 12:16.745
Well, you failed.

12:16.747 --> 12:18.863
And now my daughter
will lose her husband,

12:18.865 --> 12:22.342
my grandchild her father
and Derek his life.

12:22.344 --> 12:26.829
And you better hope that doesn't
happen, because if it does,

12:26.831 --> 12:28.932
I will destroy you.

12:30.594 --> 12:33.836
I'm sorry, Kit.

12:33.838 --> 12:35.471
I can't imagine what
you're going through.

12:35.473 --> 12:37.173
Of course you can't.

12:37.175 --> 12:39.318
Because you've likely
never loved anyone.

12:50.897 --> 12:53.166
- What is all this?
- Derek's best hope.

12:53.168 --> 12:56.401
It's a modified drug-testing bioprinter.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.442
Translation, please?

12:58.444 --> 13:00.685
We know that Derek's <i>
candida</i> is resistant

13:00.687 --> 13:02.365
to all individual drugs,

13:02.367 --> 13:04.259
but how about a
combination of those drugs?

13:05.606 --> 13:07.782
Yes, it would take
days to test them all...

13:07.784 --> 13:09.474
KIT: He barely has hours, Conrad.

13:09.476 --> 13:11.192
That's where this printer comes in.

13:11.194 --> 13:14.135
We're testing 96 different combinations

13:14.137 --> 13:16.805
- at the same time.
- PERSOPOULOS: No hits yet, but it's early.

13:16.807 --> 13:19.531
Well, let's just hope
they don't come too late.

13:19.533 --> 13:23.502
Derek's started to spike fevers,
and we all know what comes next.

13:25.484 --> 13:29.612
JUSTINE: I can't have a brain
infection. It was popcorn.

13:29.614 --> 13:31.533
Children eat it in movie theaters.

13:31.535 --> 13:34.263
Come on, there's no way this
is a real thing that happens.

13:34.265 --> 13:38.278
It's... it's extremely unusual,
but it does happen.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.996
I brought in Dr. Pravesh
to review your CT scan.

13:40.998 --> 13:44.931
So, your infection traveled
through your sinuses

13:44.933 --> 13:46.451
and into your brain here.

13:46.453 --> 13:48.077
Which would explain the seizure.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.955
(SIGHS) So, what now?

13:50.957 --> 13:53.508
Antibiotics that most
certainly constipate?

13:53.510 --> 13:57.711
Justine, you may need surgery.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.528
DEVON: And we called in
a neurosurgery consult

14:00.530 --> 14:01.799
to find out, okay?

14:01.801 --> 14:03.505
Neurosurgery?

14:03.507 --> 14:05.273
Dr. Reynolds should be here shortly...

14:05.275 --> 14:07.365
CAIN: Dr. Reynolds is stuck in surgery,

14:07.367 --> 14:09.974
I'll be doing the...

14:09.976 --> 14:12.160
the operation.

14:12.162 --> 14:15.122
(LAUGHS) Barrett.

14:15.124 --> 14:16.832
Justine.

14:19.461 --> 14:22.715
I-I didn't recognize your name
when I reviewed your chart.

14:22.717 --> 14:25.874
JUSTINE: Oh, I got a baby,
wedding, divorce. In that order.

14:25.876 --> 14:28.659
Haven't switched my name
back yet because it is a pain.

14:28.661 --> 14:31.829
Ryan was a bad choice.

14:31.831 --> 14:35.717
But I got the best part
of him: my awesome kid.

14:35.719 --> 14:38.220
So, how about you? Married?

14:38.222 --> 14:39.805
Only to my work.

14:42.509 --> 14:45.861
And, uh, how's Katie? And your mom?

14:48.490 --> 14:51.900
(CLEARS THROAT) Dr.
Pravesh, Nurse Nevin,

14:51.902 --> 14:53.326
I'll take it from here.

14:53.328 --> 14:55.579
- Yeah, sure. Cool.
- Yeah.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.651
Man, that was just
starting to get interesting.

15:01.653 --> 15:03.777
Wait, do you think she's an ex?

15:03.779 --> 15:06.728
Of course. Who do you think Katie is?

15:06.730 --> 15:08.252
Sister?

15:08.254 --> 15:09.777
I don't know, child?

15:09.779 --> 15:12.505
NIC: Huh. And he has a mom.

15:12.507 --> 15:14.230
DEVON: Well, he didn't
just spring fully formed

15:14.232 --> 15:15.924
from Satan's head.

15:15.926 --> 15:17.708
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:17.710 --> 15:21.021
Well, luckily she's my
patient and a talker.

15:21.023 --> 15:24.882
Maybe we'll finally learn something

15:24.884 --> 15:27.009
about old Barrett Cain.

15:27.011 --> 15:28.528
Hmm.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.143
So, where are we?

15:34.145 --> 15:35.561
NIC: The surgery will happen today,

15:35.563 --> 15:37.393
once we've done a full workup.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.816
After you're sedated, the oral surgeon

15:39.818 --> 15:41.614
will pull out the infected tooth.

15:41.616 --> 15:44.452
And then Dr. Cain will
remove a part of your skull

15:44.454 --> 15:46.379
- to access the infection.
- (EXHALES SHARPLY)

15:46.381 --> 15:49.699
Part of my skull. Okay,
that freaks me out.

15:49.701 --> 15:52.577
Be straight with me. How much
danger are we talking here?

15:52.579 --> 15:56.297
(EXHALES): Uh, listen...

15:56.299 --> 15:58.924
Surgery to the brain is always risky.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.525
But there's no other option,
and you're in great hands.

16:01.527 --> 16:04.213
Dr. Cain is an excellent neurosurgeon.

16:04.215 --> 16:07.308
Well, some things never change.

16:07.310 --> 16:10.403
He was always the best at
everything he did. (CHUCKLES)

16:10.405 --> 16:12.364
You were close, I take it?

16:13.391 --> 16:15.057
College.

16:15.059 --> 16:18.728
I was the girl with her nose in a book.

16:18.730 --> 16:21.156
He was the guy who flirted
me out of the library.

16:21.158 --> 16:25.067
All my friends were like,
"What? A football player?"

16:25.069 --> 16:27.278
But he had better
grades than most of them

16:27.280 --> 16:29.113
and he was the star quarterback.

16:29.115 --> 16:30.907
So Dr. Cain was a football player.

16:30.909 --> 16:32.783
He was on his way to the NFL.

16:32.785 --> 16:34.602
Scouts were all over him until...

16:34.604 --> 16:36.429
- Injury?
- ACL.

16:36.431 --> 16:39.007
Burnt his sports career to the ground.

16:39.009 --> 16:41.343
And by the time he rose from the ashes

16:41.345 --> 16:44.271
and started figuring out
what to do with his life,

16:44.273 --> 16:46.481
it was over between us.

16:47.592 --> 16:49.109
He'd changed.

16:49.111 --> 16:51.761
He had always been so in control,

16:51.763 --> 16:55.991
and suddenly there was
something that he couldn't fix.

16:57.786 --> 17:01.145
And he got bitter. Angry.

17:01.147 --> 17:04.040
It wasn't what I signed
up for, so I got out.

17:06.036 --> 17:07.919
Maybe I shouldn't have.

17:09.631 --> 17:11.589
Maybe there's still time.

17:13.326 --> 17:15.210
No.

17:15.212 --> 17:18.996
I left him, and I lost him.

17:18.998 --> 17:23.667
And now here he is when
I need him the most.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.836
(SIGHS)

17:25.838 --> 17:28.397
Barrett Cain is the one who got away.

17:33.304 --> 17:34.654
I'll be back.

17:37.326 --> 17:39.367
You look like you have news.

17:40.329 --> 17:42.019
We have a hit.

17:42.021 --> 17:43.622
(EXHALES) That's great.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.628
But what works in the lab
can be starkly different

17:55.630 --> 17:57.034
to what works in a person.

17:57.036 --> 17:59.971
True. But it's a chance, Kit.

18:01.499 --> 18:04.000
Yes.

18:04.002 --> 18:05.727
Yes, it is.

18:11.551 --> 18:12.901
Nice.

18:14.029 --> 18:15.528
Excuse me?

18:16.556 --> 18:18.106
He can't give up.

18:18.108 --> 18:21.058
- The man has a gift.
- MINA: Mm-hmm.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.227
AUSTIN: Wow.

18:23.229 --> 18:24.996
(SALSA MUSIC PLAYING OVER VIDEO)

18:28.618 --> 18:30.901
Oh...

18:30.903 --> 18:32.954
What'd you find?

18:32.956 --> 18:35.029
AUSTIN: See? Just before he degenerates

18:35.031 --> 18:37.241
- into V fib...
- The rhythm started at V tach.

18:37.243 --> 18:40.090
Which means we could ablate
it. Do you think it would work?

18:40.092 --> 18:41.537
In the right hands.

18:41.539 --> 18:43.747
And luckily, the man's
prowess on the dance floor

18:43.749 --> 18:46.796
is second only to my
own dexterity and grace.

18:46.798 --> 18:50.290
I assume that means I should
get him on the cath lab schedule.

18:50.292 --> 18:53.049
Yes. Now let's go
give him the good news.

18:53.051 --> 18:54.776
Thanks.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.808
How are you feeling, Derek?

18:57.810 --> 19:01.098
Weak. Really hot.

19:01.100 --> 19:03.486
My back hurts a bit.

19:03.488 --> 19:05.770
- What's going on?
- KIT: You have a high fever,

19:05.772 --> 19:07.278
and your blood pressure's a little low,

19:07.280 --> 19:08.564
but we're working on it.

19:08.566 --> 19:11.357
CONRAD: We have a plan,
but it is gonna be tough.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.736
Instead of using one
drug to fight the fungus,

19:13.738 --> 19:15.555
we're using a combination.

19:16.908 --> 19:18.074
MOLLY: "Voriconazole,

19:18.076 --> 19:19.867
amphotericin".

19:19.869 --> 19:21.962
His kidneys are just
starting to recover.

19:21.964 --> 19:23.245
CONRAD: I know.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.598
And I can't promise you
these drugs will work.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.323
KIT: They could even make you
feel worse in the short-term.

19:28.325 --> 19:29.769
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

19:29.771 --> 19:32.362
I've been through chemo.
I can handle this.

19:32.364 --> 19:35.132
(LAUGHS) Okay.

19:35.134 --> 19:40.096
There is one more not
particularly fun thing.

19:40.098 --> 19:42.488
W-We want to attack the fungus directly.

19:43.452 --> 19:47.527
So... we're gonna inject
the meds into your eyes.

19:47.529 --> 19:49.052
MOLLY: Wait, what?

19:49.054 --> 19:51.003
It won't hurt. Not with this.

19:51.005 --> 19:52.155
It's numbing medicine.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.723
DEREK: It's okay.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.410

- (TV TURNS OFF)
- We come with hope.

20:07.052 --> 20:10.151
Dr. Okafor and I have
familiarized ourselves

20:10.153 --> 20:12.312
with the intimate details of your heart,

20:12.314 --> 20:14.727
and we'd like to suggest a viable option

20:14.729 --> 20:17.294
to return you back
to your dancing shoes.

20:17.296 --> 20:19.202
It's a procedure called ablation.

20:19.204 --> 20:21.266
We'll thread catheters
through the main artery

20:21.268 --> 20:22.318
and vein in your groin

20:22.320 --> 20:24.530
and then burn away
the part of your heart

20:24.532 --> 20:26.016
that's been causing the abnormal rhythm.

20:26.018 --> 20:28.144
You tell me my heart is weak.

20:28.146 --> 20:31.578
And you want to fix it
by burning bits away.

20:31.580 --> 20:32.740
AUSTIN: Miguel,

20:32.742 --> 20:34.501
if this goes as well as expected,

20:34.503 --> 20:36.694
it means no more lethal arrhythmias.

20:36.696 --> 20:38.505
No more collapsing.

Second place, first place,
you are a true master.

means you can continue dancing,
