01:46.206 --> 01:48.436
I was orphaned at an early age

01:48.641 --> 01:51.166
I had no name,
so people called me Nameless

01:51.978 --> 01:54.503
Being a nobody,
I studied swordsmanship

01:55.014 --> 01:55.946
After 10 years of practice

01:56.282 --> 01:58.011
I acquired a unique skill

01:59.018 --> 02:00.713
The King of Qin has summoned me

02:01.121 --> 02:04.613
My deeds have astonished the Kingdom

02:43.163 --> 02:44.562
By order of His Majesty

02:44.764 --> 02:47.892
we have brought the mighty warrior

03:08.321 --> 03:11.722
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

03:12.425 --> 03:14.416
the three assassins from Zhao

03:14.627 --> 03:17.323
have sought His Majesty's life
for 10 years

03:17.530 --> 03:20.499
His Majesty has known no peace

03:22.268 --> 03:23.599
To the astonishment of all

03:23.803 --> 03:27.295
a mighty warrior of Qin
has smashed them

03:27.907 --> 03:32.537
His Majesty can finally sleep at night!

03:33.613 --> 03:35.740
We rejoice for our King!

03:35.982 --> 03:37.574
This warrior sent from Heaven

03:37.850 --> 03:39.613
has exterminated the assassins

03:57.570 --> 04:00.334
Summon the warrior!

04:43.516 --> 04:46.542
Remain 100 paces from His Majesty

04:46.953 --> 04:50.252
Or you will be executed.
Never forget that

05:22.555 --> 05:26.753
No one is allowed
within 100 paces of me

05:26.993 --> 05:28.187
Do you know why?

05:28.561 --> 05:29.926
To guard against assassins

05:30.863 --> 05:34.731
Yes. That's why I am confined
in this armor

05:35.001 --> 05:37.595
You have removed a great peril for me

05:38.538 --> 05:40.233
How should I reward you?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.904
My service was for Qin, not for a reward

05:43.509 --> 05:46.205
Achievements must be rewarded

05:51.851 --> 05:54.342
Sky's silver spear...

05:56.055 --> 05:59.718
wounded many of my brave warriors

06:01.527 --> 06:02.459
Announce my edict!

06:02.895 --> 06:03.793
By order of His Majesty

06:04.097 --> 06:08.431
he who kills Sky
will receive gold and land

06:08.634 --> 06:09.896
and be allowed to drink

06:10.103 --> 06:11.365
within 20 paces of His Majesty

06:32.191 --> 06:35.649
I am informed you're a citizen of Qin

06:35.862 --> 06:38.422
I am a Prefect from Leng Meng County

06:38.631 --> 06:41.464
A County Prefect over 10 square miles!

06:42.034 --> 06:44.969
Surely the lowest-ranking official in Qin

06:45.271 --> 06:49.139
How did you defeat such opponents?

06:49.675 --> 06:50.835
I took them on one by one

06:51.911 --> 06:53.003
Tell me the details

06:53.413 --> 06:54.311
Does Your Majesty know

06:54.680 --> 06:57.012
Flying Snow and Broken Sword were lovers?

06:57.383 --> 06:58.645
Yes, I do

06:59.018 --> 07:01.816
And that they hadn't spoken
for three years?

07:02.221 --> 07:04.485
For three years? Why?

07:04.724 --> 07:07.659
Flying Snow had an affair with Sky

07:08.561 --> 07:10.461
Broken Sword never forgave her

07:10.930 --> 07:13.057
Why haven't I heard this before?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.701
I went to great lengths to uncover it

07:18.704 --> 07:20.569
To divide Flying Snow and Broken Sword

07:20.907 --> 07:22.204
I first needed to eliminate Sky

07:23.643 --> 07:26.669
I have an idea of what you planned

07:26.946 --> 07:28.038
Your Majesty is wise

07:28.848 --> 07:30.873
What did you use to defeat Sky?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.147
The sword

07:35.054 --> 07:38.490
I must arrest criminals in my county

07:38.825 --> 07:39.792
On the fifth day of the sixth month

07:40.226 --> 07:42.558
Sky attended a chess house

07:43.095 --> 07:44.119
I had learned he enjoyed playing chess

07:44.564 --> 07:46.998
and listening to music there

08:07.086 --> 08:09.350
So, the seven masters of Qin Palace

08:09.789 --> 08:11.916
We are here to arrest you!

08:13.059 --> 08:15.789
Identify yourself by showing your spear

10:08.140 --> 10:08.970
Halt!

10:18.250 --> 10:20.582
What can a minor official do?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.685
This is my territory

10:23.255 --> 10:24.153
So?

10:24.657 --> 10:26.318
You are on the King's most wanted list

10:26.959 --> 10:28.085
I am placing you under arrest

12:04.457 --> 12:08.018
Old man, please play one more tune

12:33.519 --> 12:35.544
Martial arts and music are different

12:36.021 --> 12:37.283
but they share the same principle

12:38.057 --> 12:40.685
Both stress attaining a supreme state

12:42.128 --> 12:46.030
Sky and I faced each other
for a long time

12:46.732 --> 12:48.165
Neither of us moved

12:48.968 --> 12:52.995
We fought the battle in our minds

15:41.941 --> 15:43.670
How swift thy sword!

15:46.645 --> 15:50.843
I thought I knew everything
about my Kingdom

15:51.050 --> 15:52.642
I didn't know that Leng Meng County

15:52.985 --> 15:56.079
held a talent like yours

16:01.327 --> 16:02.385
Broken Sword

16:04.863 --> 16:06.091
Flying Snow

16:06.899 --> 16:07.695
By order of His Majesty!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.693
Flying Snow and Broken Sword

16:10.970 --> 16:12.460
have teamed up for assassination

16:12.738 --> 16:15.229
He who kills either of them

16:15.507 --> 16:18.067
will receive gold and land

16:18.377 --> 16:19.366
and be allowed to drink

16:19.745 --> 16:21.144
within 10 paces of His Majesty

16:41.700 --> 16:42.394
Three years ago, Flying Snow

16:42.601 --> 16:45.035
stormed the palace with Broken Sword

16:45.237 --> 16:48.764
3000 elite troops couldn't stop them

16:50.609 --> 16:54.101
I've since emptied the palace

16:54.313 --> 16:56.247
so assassins cannot hide

16:58.117 --> 17:00.176
Was your sword swifter
than theirs combined?

17:00.486 --> 17:01.418
No

17:04.757 --> 17:06.281
How did you do it, then?

17:18.103 --> 17:19.627
Disguised as a citizen of Zhao

17:19.872 --> 17:22.339
I sought them in the Kingdom of Zhao

17:22.741 --> 17:23.833
I learned they were hiding

17:24.076 --> 17:26.601
in a calligraphy school

17:26.944 --> 17:29.743
under the names Highcliff and Springbrook

17:30.315 --> 17:31.179
Rumor had it

17:31.383 --> 17:33.283
the Qin army would attack that day

17:33.619 --> 17:35.951
Most of the townspeople had fled

17:36.422 --> 17:37.980
Only the school's students remained

17:39.525 --> 17:42.119
Why have you come at such a time?

17:42.494 --> 17:43.722
Who are you?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.827
I'm from Yi County
in the Kingdom of Zhao

17:47.733 --> 17:49.564
My father's dying wish

17:49.835 --> 17:51.462
was for one of your scrolls

17:51.770 --> 17:55.228
I fear this may be our school's last day

17:56.375 --> 17:59.105
Which calligrapher do you seek?

17:59.511 --> 18:01.035
I respectfully request Master Highcliff

18:01.346 --> 18:03.576
Highcliff was Broken Sword

18:04.016 --> 18:05.711
Legend said his skill as a swordsman

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
was rooted in his calligraphy

18:08.487 --> 18:10.216
So I had my concerns

18:10.656 --> 18:13.625
I needed to find out if it was true

18:15.627 --> 18:16.594
What do you want written?

18:16.962 --> 18:17.826
"Sword."

18:21.600 --> 18:23.227
You are fond of the sword?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.638
It was my father's dying wish

18:37.883 --> 18:38.815
What size scroll?

18:40.185 --> 18:41.152
Eight feet

18:43.489 --> 18:47.448
For that size I will need red ink

18:47.793 --> 18:48.817
My master has asked me

18:49.328 --> 18:51.523
to borrow some red ink

18:56.335 --> 18:57.825
My master wants to borrow some red ink

19:05.744 --> 19:07.302
Did you hear me, Master Springbrook?

19:08.180 --> 19:10.080
Master Highcliff wants to borrow red ink

19:13.585 --> 19:14.609
Tell him to come himself

19:30.135 --> 19:31.500
Could I have some red ink?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.983
The character "sword"
was still being written

20:23.322 --> 20:24.789
when Your Majesty's troops

20:25.023 --> 20:26.991
arrived at the city gates

21:48.740 --> 21:49.672
Draw!

21:52.611 --> 21:55.045
Your Majesty's army is invincible

21:55.247 --> 21:56.612
not only because it is brave

21:56.848 --> 21:58.338
but also because of its archery

21:59.351 --> 22:02.582
with a greater range than any other army

22:03.188 --> 22:06.715
The Qin archers are like artillery

22:06.958 --> 22:09.324
intimidating the enemy

22:19.738 --> 22:24.641
Hail! Hail! Hail!

23:08.520 --> 23:09.748
Please remember

23:11.123 --> 23:12.988
their arrows might destroy our town

23:13.892 --> 23:16.554
and topple our Kingdom

23:17.496 --> 23:19.726
but they can never
obliterate our culture

23:21.333 --> 23:22.459
Today

23:22.768 --> 23:26.829
you will learn the essence of our culture

23:54.633 --> 23:57.363
Hail! Hail! Hail!

24:17.522 --> 24:20.013
Those Zhao people didn't flee?

24:20.225 --> 24:22.159
They drew strength from their calligraphy

24:22.427 --> 24:25.089
What was so difficult about "sword"?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.822
There are 19 different ways to write it

24:28.033 --> 24:29.500
I asked Broken Sword

24:29.768 --> 24:32.532
for a 20th way

24:32.938 --> 24:33.905
Both calligraphy and swordplay

24:34.172 --> 24:36.436
rely on one's strength and spirit

24:36.808 --> 24:37.866
The 20th style would reveal

24:38.176 --> 24:41.043
the essence of his swordsmanship

24:41.279 --> 24:44.271
How odd to write it in 19 ways

24:44.616 --> 24:46.106
It makes the written language

24:46.585 --> 24:47.847
impossible to comprehend

24:49.221 --> 24:51.712
Once I've conquered the six Kingdoms

24:51.957 --> 24:53.481
and all the northern tribes

24:53.692 --> 24:56.126
I will eradicate this problem

24:56.328 --> 24:57.488
by mandating one style of writing

24:57.696 --> 25:00.130
Wouldn't that be ideal?

25:01.399 --> 25:03.230
Your Majesty won't stop
at the six Kingdoms?

25:03.602 --> 25:05.467
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

25:05.704 --> 25:08.195
I will lead my army to conquer vast lands

25:08.573 --> 25:11.303
and establish a great empire

25:13.645 --> 25:16.443
Hail! Hail! Hail!

25:56.888 --> 25:58.116
Master Springbrook

25:59.024 --> 26:00.150
Why are you going outside?

26:00.592 --> 26:01.581
To fend off the arrows

26:02.193 --> 26:04.024
You aren't needed. Stay inside

26:04.863 --> 26:07.525
The Qin archers are powerful

26:08.033 --> 26:09.625
You alone may not stop them

26:41.700 --> 26:44.498
Hail! Hail! Hail!

28:38.917 --> 28:39.713
You are good

28:40.819 --> 28:42.878
You are even better

28:43.488 --> 28:44.785
You didn't come here for calligraphy

28:46.725 --> 28:47.589
Who are you?

28:48.093 --> 28:51.324
I've traveled here to deliver an item

28:53.898 --> 28:55.195
Please meet me in the library at midnight

29:04.109 --> 29:05.076
Great calligraphy

29:05.710 --> 29:06.677
Great swordplay

29:07.178 --> 29:09.146
You didn't even see my swordplay

29:09.581 --> 29:11.981
I couldn't have written without it

29:13.551 --> 29:14.575
At midnight

29:14.986 --> 29:17.853
meet me in the library

29:18.890 --> 29:20.357
Several hundred thousand Qin troops

29:20.625 --> 29:23.958
were readying for the next onslaught

29:25.797 --> 29:27.731
I studied the character all night

29:27.999 --> 29:30.490
trying to unlock the secret of his skills

29:42.280 --> 29:44.407
It would reveal his swordsmanship?

29:44.616 --> 29:48.177
But it's just an ordinary word

29:49.721 --> 29:52.451
Calligraphy and swordplay are similar

29:52.824 --> 29:54.451
One must comprehend their true essence

29:56.461 --> 29:57.655
Did you discover it?

29:57.996 --> 29:59.122
It eluded me

29:59.597 --> 30:03.226
So how did you challenge them?

30:04.135 --> 30:07.593
Although they hadn't spoken in three years,
They spied on each other.

30:07.872 --> 30:09.100
At midnight,

30:09.407 --> 30:11.466
Broken Sword would
peek into Flying Snow's room.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.044
At 2 o'clock in the morning,

30:19.284 --> 30:21.809
she would spy on Broken Sword.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.356
What strange behaviour.

30:31.563 --> 30:35.863
I was surprised too.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.997
So I used Sky's
silver spear to get to them.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.771
Sky died by your sword?

30:51.349 --> 30:52.247
Yes

30:54.786 --> 30:57.983
Who are you? Why are you here?

30:58.489 --> 30:59.786
I'm from the Kingdom of Qin

30:59.991 --> 31:01.788
I have a message from Sky

31:02.260 --> 31:03.158
Go on

31:03.528 --> 31:04.460
He said he had lived a life

31:04.662 --> 31:07.358
without responsibilities or commitments

31:07.699 --> 31:09.360
He cared for only one person

31:10.869 --> 31:11.665
Who?

31:12.103 --> 31:13.127
Flying Snow

31:24.515 --> 31:27.279
Sky was certain she'd avenge his death

31:37.862 --> 31:41.730
To fight, meet me at the Qin camp

34:02.774 --> 34:03.763
You can leave now

34:09.614 --> 34:10.739
Go!

34:46.818 --> 34:48.308
I know you saw us!

34:50.955 --> 34:52.013
Let me tell you,

34:52.223 --> 34:54.088
I have an affair with her for three years.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.725
I let you see us on purpose!

35:03.701 --> 35:05.464
I no longer care about you at all!

36:52.143 --> 36:54.805
We were both very foolish

37:32.683 --> 37:34.913
I just wanted you to care about me.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.417
I'm not going to fight you

38:15.526 --> 38:16.390
Go away!

38:21.532 --> 38:24.160
I will kill you in honor of my master!

39:54.492 --> 39:56.960
You ask to die. I will help you.

42:59.109 --> 42:59.939
Why do you laugh?

43:01.579 --> 43:03.877
What you did last night was stupid

43:48.926 --> 43:50.518
My plan proved successful

43:50.761 --> 43:52.786
When Flying Snow was fighting me

43:53.163 --> 43:55.893
she was disturbed and disoriented

43:56.266 --> 43:58.325
I defeated her easily

44:12.483 --> 44:14.383
I never imagined supreme warriors

44:14.585 --> 44:16.246
like Broken Sword and Flying Snow

44:16.453 --> 44:18.284
allowing their emotions
to be a liability

44:36.240 --> 44:39.732
It sounds as if you did divide them

44:40.010 --> 44:40.806
Yes

44:41.211 --> 44:42.371
In that case, they must have been

44:42.579 --> 44:45.514
petty and narrow-minded

44:45.749 --> 44:46.647
TRUE

44:46.917 --> 44:49.477
Your story sounds logical

44:49.687 --> 44:51.120
But

44:51.355 --> 44:54.153
you have underestimated one person.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.255
Who?

44:57.294 --> 44:58.124
Me

44:59.129 --> 45:02.587
Would you like my impression of them?

45:03.333 --> 45:06.063
Three years ago they stormed the palace

45:07.037 --> 45:08.561
I was impressed

45:08.939 --> 45:11.203
by their valor and dignity

45:11.408 --> 45:12.932
Their character could not be petty

45:13.944 --> 45:16.276
So Flying Snow's affair with Sky is a lie

45:16.480 --> 45:18.004
Their betrayal of one another is a lie

45:18.215 --> 45:21.275
The story you just told is a lie!

45:24.521 --> 45:27.513
Except for one thing

45:29.159 --> 45:32.686
Sky did know one of you

45:32.930 --> 45:33.760
Who?

45:35.199 --> 45:36.291
You

45:37.568 --> 45:40.503
I surmise you two were old friends

45:42.072 --> 45:45.007
And Sky's defeat has only one explanation

45:45.209 --> 45:46.141
What's that?

45:47.911 --> 45:49.469
He permitted it

45:55.552 --> 45:58.544
To kill me, the two of you formed a pact

45:58.756 --> 46:01.486
using my men as witnesses

46:01.859 --> 46:04.020
That was not hard to arrange

46:04.261 --> 46:06.320
The hardest part was to persuade Sky

46:06.530 --> 46:07.792
to put his life in your hands

46:08.699 --> 46:11.793
You were not fast enough to defeat Sky

46:12.136 --> 46:14.798
He died willingly under your sword

46:15.172 --> 46:17.333
Such devotion deserves true respect

46:17.875 --> 46:19.069
He was the first to sacrifice himself

46:19.276 --> 46:21.176
for your mission

46:23.680 --> 46:26.171
Sky was proud

46:26.383 --> 46:28.044
He saw himself as an unrivaled fighter

46:28.285 --> 46:30.845
What convinced him you could succeed

46:31.054 --> 46:32.521
where he had failed?

46:34.224 --> 46:37.625
You have trained, perhaps for 10 years

46:38.061 --> 46:40.359
with one goal, my assassination

46:40.564 --> 46:43.055
You have a great skill
that few can counter

46:53.544 --> 46:57.002
Killing Sky got you within 20 paces of me

46:57.281 --> 46:59.806
So why seek out
Broken Sword and Flying Snow?

47:00.417 --> 47:03.181
I surmise that your skill

47:03.520 --> 47:05.385
requires you to come within 10 paces

47:06.456 --> 47:09.653
You needed a second sacrifice

47:09.860 --> 47:11.555
to claim another reward

47:11.762 --> 47:13.093
to bring you within 10 paces

47:15.799 --> 47:17.494
Although Broken Sword and Flying Snow

47:17.701 --> 47:19.692
had never met Sky

47:19.903 --> 47:20.835
they instantly understood

47:21.038 --> 47:23.563
the reason for his defeat

47:36.753 --> 47:38.778
How far am I from the bookshelves?

47:40.357 --> 47:41.483
About 10 paces

47:41.925 --> 47:43.722
10 paces is fine

48:28.238 --> 48:30.069
I need one of you to help me

48:30.440 --> 48:31.907
Please decide between yourselves

48:32.276 --> 48:33.743
Meet me at the Qin camp tomorrow morning

48:47.624 --> 48:48.682
How swift thy sword!

48:50.794 --> 48:51.658
TRUE

48:52.095 --> 48:53.494
Sky was a superior warrior

48:54.631 --> 48:56.622
He willingly gave his life to this man

48:58.035 --> 48:59.525
He can kill the King

49:04.207 --> 49:05.265
We must proceed

49:06.209 --> 49:09.110
That means we will die

49:12.049 --> 49:13.482
Then we die together

50:33.497 --> 50:34.828
You were one step ahead of me

50:56.019 --> 50:57.577
Did I hurt you too much?

50:59.189 --> 51:00.417
I should be the one who fights him

51:03.126 --> 51:04.616
I want you to live

51:05.328 --> 51:08.525
If you died, how could I live?

51:10.634 --> 51:14.627
You will live on, promise me

51:22.879 --> 51:23.903
Say it!

51:36.093 --> 51:37.082
All right

51:46.570 --> 51:47.901
Moon is on her way

51:52.209 --> 51:53.198
I had better go

53:35.111 --> 53:36.908
I am Nameless,
Prefect of Leng Meng County

53:37.280 --> 53:40.807
Please allow me to fight this assassin

53:41.384 --> 53:43.113
She is on His Majesty's most wanted list

53:43.320 --> 53:45.948
Now she's here, I will arrest her

53:46.356 --> 53:48.381
The assassin and I have an agreement

53:48.725 --> 53:50.215
to fight one on one

53:50.560 --> 53:51.584
Should I be unable to defeat her

53:51.895 --> 53:53.886
please apprehend her

53:54.431 --> 53:55.557
Your permission is sought

54:48.184 --> 54:49.082
Draw your sword!

55:20.016 --> 55:23.918
Hail! Hail! Hail!

55:25.221 --> 55:26.051
Make your move!

55:28.491 --> 55:30.857
Hail! Hail! Hail!

55:32.929 --> 55:34.590
I die willingly

55:34.831 --> 55:35.593
Make your move

55:40.203 --> 55:42.967
Hail! Hail! Hail!

55:45.175 --> 55:47.905
Hail! Hail! Hail!

55:50.213 --> 55:53.114
Hail! Hail! Hail!

55:55.318 --> 55:58.116
Hail! Hail! Hail!

56:48.938 --> 56:49.962
How swift thy sword!

58:07.217 --> 58:10.152
What are you here for?

58:11.454 --> 58:12.785
For what you once said.

58:13.923 --> 58:17.620
"I will fight the one
who harms Flying Snow."

58:18.962 --> 58:19.860
Please draw your sword.

58:33.376 --> 58:34.070
Thank you.

58:35.512 --> 58:38.242
I believe that you and Broken Sword

58:38.448 --> 58:39.881
had a fight as well.

58:40.250 --> 58:43.447
It was not a battle of life and death,

58:43.720 --> 58:47.383
but rather a way to commemorate
the death of Flying Snow.

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.570
My master wishes you to have his sword

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:06.839
Why?

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.677
He and she are bound in life and death

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:14.252
They will never part,
nor will their swords

01:03:25.168 --> 01:03:26.601
It is his dying wish

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.198
that you take his sword for your mission

01:04:05.074 --> 01:04:06.769
Sky, Flying Snow and Broken Sword

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:09.274
sacrificed themselves

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:12.013
so you can be within 10 paces of me

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.911
All three gave you their lives

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.950
The best of friends could not give more

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.886
Therefore you are

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.522
the most dangerous assassin of all

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.428
How did you uncover my plan?

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.774
The flames of these candles

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.041
are disturbed by your murderous intent

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.718
All of you

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.079
are willing to die for a cause

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:57.017
I'm ashamed to say
I am not that committed

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.225
Your Majesty has seen through our plan

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:04.192
If I had realized this sooner

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:08.701
I wouldn't have allowed you so close

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:12.272
A citizen of Qin would not do this

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.806
Who are you?

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.341
A man of Zhao

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.377
Your Qin soldiers killed my family

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.981
I wandered into Qin

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.548
and was adopted

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.515
I discovered my real identity
10 years ago

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:26.579
and set my heart on this plan

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.018
You've come to avenge Zhao

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.892
I see

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.128
I would like to know

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.699
if your special skill has a name

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:40.196
As Your Majesty guessed

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.932
there is only one crucial move

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:43.337
What is that?

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.237
"Death within 10 Paces."

01:05:45.741 --> 01:05:48.710
"Death within 10 Paces!" A good name

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:50.706
All my guards are 100 paces away

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.972
outside the palace

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:55.412
You are within 10 paces

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:57.543
It would seem

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:01.749
that today I am doomed

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:11.030
But I sense your hesitation

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:13.927
Your Majesty is perceptive

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:15.726
However

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.170
you too have underestimated someone.

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:21.206
Who?

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.501
Broken Sword

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:31.543
I needed to prove to them

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:35.188
that my sword was fast and accurate

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:23.037
Within 10 paces

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.036
my sword strikes with surgical precision

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.534
If it enters at precise pressure points

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:30.837
it will not cause any fatal injury

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.172
If one of you would take a blow

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:36.913
before witnesses, we can fool the King

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.119
Such a blow is hardly child's play

01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:44.157
How is Sky now?

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:45.685
Fully recovered

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:48.392
His trust in your sword
was extraordinary

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.993
The King's security is impenetrable

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:52.828
There was no other way

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.730
His Imperial Guards were useless

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:59.572
He should have died three years ago.

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:00.831
What went wrong?

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.210
I abandoned the plan

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:11.983
The King must not be killed

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:13.853
He said that?

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:14.715
Yes

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.822
Why?

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.252
I also asked him

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:18.816
What did he say?

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.095
He would not explain that day

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.224
Broken Sword is the strongest
of the three

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:29.460
He and I are probably equal in skills

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:34.968
What he told me later

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:37.645
greatly unsettled me

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.337
While I'm alive

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.104
I'll stop you assassinating the King

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:45.814
I will help you

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.416
He let the opportunity go by

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.486
This time, we must succeed

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:57.294
See you tomorrow at the Qin camp

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.567
Please do me a favor

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.006
Help me fight Broken Sword!

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:20.783
Master!

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:28.697
What are you waiting for?

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.863
Although I had agreed to help her

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.933
attack from behind is dishonorable

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.696
so I couldn't draw my sword

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.435
But we both knew

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.407
if we did not stop Broken Sword

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.703
we would never succeed

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:37.716
Moon, don't!

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.855
You're no match for him. Stop

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:07.854
I knew this would happen

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.485
You can't stop me now

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:14.590
Even wounded, I will still stop you

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:17.894
Then I will kill you!

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.972
Did I hurt him too much?

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.406
Your special medicine

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:33.237
should heal his wounds in a day

01:12:34.316 --> 01:12:35.442
Have you delivered it?

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.475
I tended to the wound myself

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:42.018
After the battle,
carry my "Flying Snow Sword"

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:43.657
and follow Nameless to see the King

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.160
Yes

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:47.452
They won't treat a servant harshly

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.195
If the assassination succeeds

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.531
wave a red flag on your return

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:55.499
If it fails, a yellow one

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:58.134
If something happens to you

01:12:58.340 --> 01:12:59.671
any message will be useless

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.535
I will smile from Heaven

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:06.809
if I see a red flag

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:12.737
How is Flying Snow?

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.409
She is resting

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.453
She doesn't know I've come

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:23.556
You said you'd stop me

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.551
Please abandon the mission

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:27.293
You know I am a man of Zhao

01:14:27.563 --> 01:14:28.530
So am I

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.430
Doesn't Qin want to conquer Zhao?

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:31.897
Yes

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.931
Isn't the King the enemy of Zhao?

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:35.100
Yes

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.368
Who are you trying to defend?

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.001
You call yourself a man of Zhao?

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:47.337
Flying Snow has asked me that too

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:51.953
When we first met

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.751
I was living a carefree life

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:03.022
I fell in love with her
after our first fight.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.296
She's the daughter of a Zhao general

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.266
who died in battle against Qin

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:11.104
She inherited his sword

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.001
I knew she would avenge her father

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:17.038
I promised to help her

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:21.540
Calligraphy and swordplay

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.942
share the same principles

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:26.648
We did calligraphy to
inspire our swordplay

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:27.978
and to heighten our powers

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:32.225
She knew I'd drifted since childhood

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:35.328
calling no place home

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:36.962
Once we'd killed the King, she said

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.232
she would take me to her home

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:43.004
There'd be no more swordsmen

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:44.731
only a man

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:45.929
and a woman

01:16:15.103 --> 01:16:17.298
The essence of calligraphy
is from the soul

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:18.999
Swordsmanship is the same

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.833
Both aspire to truth and simplicity

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.639
Gradually I recognized a greater cause

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:33.678
Three years ago we perfected our skills

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.851
Flying Snow insisted on going ahead

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.790
Together, we stormed the palace

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:19.472
She asked why I had abandoned the mission

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.309
I told her the King must not be killed

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:25.742
That is what calligraphy taught me

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:28.441
I didn't kill the King

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:31.046
After that she refused to talk to me

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.719
Please abandon your plan

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:40.023
No

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.420
Was your sword forged in hatred?

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:43.962
Yes

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.898
For 10 years, it has never tired

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.869
I can't stop now

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:51.499
How can I dissuade you?

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:53.504
Only by killing me

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.400
Are you that determined?

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:56.973
Yes

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:00.514
Allow me to convey my conviction

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.043
in three words

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:48.923
These words express my mind

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.424
Please consider

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:03.667
Moon, give my sword to Master Nameless

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.837
Flying Snow and I will never part

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.273
nor will our swords

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.290
Master Nameless

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.857
although I am just a humble servant

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:27.935
allow me to say a few words

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:32.367
I've been with my master since
I was eight

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.535
He taught me martial arts

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.367
and how to be a decent person

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.210
Whatever my master does

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.845
is for a good reason

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.548
The words he has given you

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.747
carry a deep meaning

01:23:50.225 --> 01:23:53.217
This will be the last thing
I can do for my master.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.060
Master Nameless,

01:23:57.599 --> 01:23:59.533
please remember his words.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:13.379
Why did you want to do that?

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.682
I wanted to follow the example of my master,

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.519
and to persuade you with my life.

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:21.449
You're still young.
Life is precious.

01:24:21.689 --> 01:24:23.850
If you must die,
you should die for a greater cause.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:29.860
Be on your way.

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:32.764
I will remember what should be remembered.

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.443
What were the words he wrote?

01:24:53.721 --> 01:24:54.688
"All under Heaven."

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:57.187
All under Heaven...

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:58.256
Broken Sword said

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:02.196
The people
have suffered years of warfare

01:25:02.664 --> 01:25:04.894
Only the King of Qin can stop the chaos

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.828
by uniting all under Heaven.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.238
He asked me to abandon the assassination

01:25:12.273 --> 01:25:13.763
for the greater good of all

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:17.173
He said, one person's suffering
is nothing

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:20.575
compared to the suffering of many

01:25:21.683 --> 01:25:23.412
The rivalry of Zhao and Qin is trivial

01:25:23.918 --> 01:25:27.217
compared to the greater cause

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.828
The person who really understands me

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:36.758
is my most feared enemy

01:25:42.203 --> 01:25:43.932
Alone, I have endured so much criticism

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:47.802
So many attempts on my life

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:50.307
No one understands my intentions

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:53.043
Even my court officials

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:56.746
see me as a tyrant

01:25:59.387 --> 01:26:02.288
But I never imagined

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.617
that Broken Sword, my arch-enemy

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.090
would truly understand

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.861
and appreciate my real motives

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:25.476
I would like to know

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:28.807
how you mean to kill me
without your sword?

01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:30.575
By capturing yours!

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.500
This sword has protected me

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.225
through all my battles

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:52.097
Having found a true confidant
in Broken Sword

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:55.037
even if I died,
I would be content with my life.

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.435
Let "All under Heaven"

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.811
guide your decision

01:29:08.343 --> 01:29:09.742
It's just dawned on me!

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.638
This scroll of Broken Sword's

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.871
isn't about sword technique

01:29:14.082 --> 01:29:16.607
but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:19.916
Swordsmanship's first achievement

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.653
is the unity of man and sword

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.915
Once this unity is attained

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:26.252
even a blade of grass can be a weapon

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:28.384
The second achievement is when

01:29:28.896 --> 01:29:32.093
the sword exists in one's heart

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.700
when absent from one's hand
One can strike an enemy at 100 paces

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:37.234
even with bare hands

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:39.873
Swordsmanship's ultimate achievement

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:44.338
is the absence of the sword
in both hand and heart

01:29:44.645 --> 01:29:45.873
The swordsman is at peace

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.274
with the rest of the world

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:50.407
He vows not to kill

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:52.652
and to bring peace to mankind

01:30:19.447 --> 01:30:23.543
Your Majesty,
your visions have convinced me

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.085
that you are committed to the highest ideal

01:30:29.056 --> 01:30:30.421
of ultimate swordsmanship

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:33.826
Therefore I cannot kill you

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:40.090
Remember those who gave their lives

01:30:41.335 --> 01:30:43.326
for the highest ideal: Peace.

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:23.629
No more killing
Nameless went within 10 paces of the King

01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:27.232
He could not have missed

01:33:28.502 --> 01:33:30.663
There is only one explanation

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:32.699
He must have abandoned the mission

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.310
What did you say to him?

01:33:36.777 --> 01:33:38.267
I wrote three words

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:39.980
What words?

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.006
"All under Heaven."

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:47.011
That is all you care about!

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:47.948
And you

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:51.088
I don't believe you

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.685
How can I convince you?

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.299
Draw your sword

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.131
You've misled Nameless

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:09.175
You've ruined Sky
and the Kingdom of Zhao

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:10.440
Draw!

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:16.243
When we first met...

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:19.683
I had to prove myself to convince you

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:24.284
What can I do this time?

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.458
Just draw your sword!

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:54.941
Why didn't you fend off my sword?

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:57.681
So that you'd believe me

01:36:06.026 --> 01:36:07.994
I always wanted to go home with you

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:14.965
Sadly, it won't happen now

01:36:20.307 --> 01:36:21.934
Take good care of yourself

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:37.687
Why didn't you defend yourself?

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:48.065
Why didn't you defend yourself?

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.478
Why didn't you?

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:15.152
No more drifting, no more roaming

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:23.686
I'm taking you home now

01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:27.991
Our home

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.177
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:47.404
Permission to execute?

01:39:48.482 --> 01:39:49.642
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:53.308
Permission to execute?

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:16.335
He conspired to assassinate Your Majesty

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:17.771
Show no mercy!

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:21.505
This is the law of Qin!

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:26.316
To conquer all under Heaven

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:28.579
the law must be enforced

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.257
Set an example for the world!

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:35.820
Execute him! Execute him!

01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:37.463
Execute him!

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.192
Execute him! Execute him!

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:44.837
Execute him!

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:55.303
Execute him!

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:21.801
Hail! Hail! Hail!

01:42:24.171 --> 01:42:28.232
Hail! Hail! Hail!

01:42:29.305 --> 01:42:35.779
