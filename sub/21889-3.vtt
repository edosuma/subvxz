Every year, Fernando gets all patriotic,

Oh, Teri.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.388
Well, she had a yoga retreat,

I don't get it.

Yeah, he does have a point.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.868
You still run into the same problem.

Yeah, but maybe if it was pottery class

I've seen 42 Fourth of Julys come and go,

08:26.380 --> 08:28.299

11:26.185 --> 11:27.978
[laughs]

11:30.481 --> 11:31.732
Please stop laughing.

11:32.608 --> 11:33.859
You're being immature.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.780
I'm not immature. I'm nine-and-a-half.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.366
But you're acting like you're nine.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.662
[Jimmy] Hey, Stepho.

11:44.745 --> 11:45.746
[phone rings]

11:46.122 --> 11:47.790
Jimmy, can you hand me my phone?

11:47.873 --> 11:49.542
Yeah... ah...

11:51.794 --> 11:54.296
That would be helping you, so no.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.299
You are right.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.217
OK.

11:58.801 --> 11:59.885
These. OK.

11:59.969 --> 12:00.803
Coming.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.058
Hello?

12:06.517 --> 12:09.019
Oh, hi. Yes, yeah.
You need my account number.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.480
OK, great.
Hold on. It's in my purse.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.065
Jimmy, can you hand me my purse?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.733
I love you too much for that.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.656
Hang on just a second.

12:22.158 --> 12:22.992
That...

12:23.492 --> 12:24.326
Here.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.036
All right. Let's see.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.371
[timer pings]

12:27.788 --> 12:29.498
DJ! Your pies are ready!

12:30.040 --> 12:31.000
DJ!

12:32.751 --> 12:34.587
Sorry, just let me get these pies out.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.672
[mutters] Oh!

12:38.966 --> 12:40.384
Can somebody help me?

12:41.051 --> 12:44.513
47 people live in this freaking house
and no one is in the kitchen?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.809
All right, uh...
Don't go away! I will be right back!

12:50.478 --> 12:53.439
Pies. Getting pies. Gonna get pies.
Yes. OK.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.859
Oh, good. Tommy.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.360
OK, pick up my phone.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.281
Now hand it to me.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.033
Hello.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.868
Can you hand me my phone, honey?

13:05.951 --> 13:08.162
Great, good, yes. Now bring it to me.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.788
Oh, no, no, no!

13:12.625 --> 13:15.711
Tell them my account number is 74283!

13:21.926 --> 13:23.636
OK, I'd like to welcome you all

13:23.719 --> 13:27.306
to Danny Tanner's
World's Cleanest Pie-Eating Contest.

13:28.974 --> 13:32.311
Because shoving pie in your mouth as fast
as you can does not have to be messy.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.732
Hot dang!
Ain't nothin' more American than pie!

13:39.610 --> 13:40.486
Please stop that.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.948
I happen to have here
the clipboard of fun.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.533
Yes, the very same one.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.953
And we are gonna review the rules.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.788
"Article One, Section One.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.414
Each two-person team

13:52.498 --> 13:54.959
feeds his or her partner simultaneously.

13:55.626 --> 14:00.172
First team to finish their pie
with a clean smock wins."

14:00.256 --> 14:02.424
Come on, Matt. You ready to win?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.635
Oh, now you want me to talk?

14:06.512 --> 14:10.182
Too bad I wasn't wearing this earlier
when you ruined my vest.

14:11.850 --> 14:12.685
"Section Three.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.979
Performance-enhancing substances

14:15.062 --> 14:17.982
such as Beano, Gas-X
and/or Tums are not allowed."

14:18.816 --> 14:20.192
So? You gonna help me win?

14:20.818 --> 14:21.819
Nah.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.240
I'll take pictures of every bite,
so some day we can show our kids.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.700
I can't breathe.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.159
Well, here, take my air.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.578
[blowing]

14:30.661 --> 14:31.579
No, no, no. OK.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.958
"And finally, the first team to finish
their pie with a clean sheet takes home...

14:36.542 --> 14:37.918
the Golden Napkin."

14:40.212 --> 14:41.714
All right? Are you ready?

14:42.172 --> 14:45.509
In three, two, stay clean!

14:45.843 --> 14:47.261
[blows whistle]

14:50.764 --> 14:53.350
[Danny] Hey, hey! Did you people
not listen to the rules?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.812
I said them specifically--
the goal is cleanliness.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.314
What is happening?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.693
What? You're not... What are you doing?

15:03.694 --> 15:05.571
This is not what this is!

15:05.654 --> 15:08.365
DJ, Stephanie,
this is not how I raised you.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.162
Hey! Stop it!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.248
-Guys, stop it!
-[all clamoring]

15:16.332 --> 15:17.541
This is not what this is about!

15:19.209 --> 15:21.295
It's supposed to be a clean contest!

15:22.671 --> 15:25.424
This is a disgrace to clean pie-eating
everywhere!

15:25.507 --> 15:26.467
Stop, stop, stop!

15:26.550 --> 15:27.843
[whistle blows]

15:27.927 --> 15:29.261
You're all disqualified!

15:31.972 --> 15:33.349
I don't know what's going on,

15:33.432 --> 15:36.101
but this is not how we deal with problems
in this family.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.605
We talk it out, we work it out,
and we hug it out.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.192
Now Matt, you seem to be upset with DJ.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.029
Yeah! During our big Facebook Live moment,
she kept cutting me off--

15:47.112 --> 15:48.739
I did not cut you off!

15:50.950 --> 15:52.576
Oh, I just cut you off.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.162
[sighs] I'm sorry.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.456
It's just, when I get nervous,
I start talking,

15:57.539 --> 16:00.042
and then maybe I forget to stop.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.795
Forgive me?

16:03.712 --> 16:04.672
Of course I will.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.055
Are you done talking?

16:13.931 --> 16:14.765
Yes.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.642
See? I'm improving.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.644
I love you.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.813
-And I love you, too.
-Aww.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.524
Look at that.

16:23.607 --> 16:26.276
Mr. Communication says
we share because we care.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.529
OK. Who's next?

16:28.612 --> 16:29.863
Me! Me.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.326
Fernando...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.495
Let me say this as sweetly as possible.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.081
I hate Frank Smith.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.918
Are you frickin' kiddin' me?

16:46.296 --> 16:50.092
Baby, there is nothing hotter
than when you are being you.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.469
I can be that Fernando dude.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.265
Oh, wait. I forgot how to do it.

16:57.933 --> 16:58.809
Testing?

16:59.727 --> 17:01.437
[in Texan accent] Uno, dos, tres,

17:01.520 --> 17:02.688
cuatro...

17:02.771 --> 17:04.398
[in Spanish accent] cinco, seis...

17:04.481 --> 17:06.608
Kimmy, Kimmy, Kimberlina, mi amor.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.365
Your suavecito is back.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.408
Dios mio.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.912
Thanks to me, another breakthrough.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.915
OK, who would like to be next
to share with this group?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.125
I'll go.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.043
OK.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.252
Jimmy...

17:25.753 --> 17:27.671
when I said "Please don't help me,"

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
I didn't mean don't ever help me.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.719
So, when you said don't help you,
you really mean, sometimes help you.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.014
Exactly.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.640
That makes perfect sense.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.683
Man, I'm an idiot.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.688
Now, that's so beautiful.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.399
OK. Hey, little people.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.152
Give it a try.

17:51.487 --> 17:54.281
Max, are you still mad at me
for laughing at you?

17:54.364 --> 17:55.199
Yes.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.077
And now I'm giving you
the silent treatment.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.330
And now it's over.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.124
You're my angel.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.669
Wanna hold hands and skip around?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.506
You read my mind.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.345
You know, I think those crazy kids
are gonna make it.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.014
What about you two?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.265
Ah, we're doing great.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.394
Uh... Look, Jackson. We've got to talk.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.022
Oh, my God.
Don't tell me you're breaking up with me.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.818
I... I can change.
I can change everything about me.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.403
You're the best thing in my entire life.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.322
Why, Lola?

18:35.405 --> 18:36.949
[sobs]

18:37.533 --> 18:38.826
Why?

18:38.909 --> 18:40.369
[sobs]

18:45.332 --> 18:46.208
Called it.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.296
I'll be right there.
I just have to award the winner.

18:51.380 --> 18:55.092
OK, guys,
we have a new pie-eating champion.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.512
And the Golden Napkin goes to...

18:59.805 --> 19:00.848
Cosmo.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.229
Look at him.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.606
Clean tin, clean sheet.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.233
It's beautiful.

19:12.860 --> 19:13.944
You know...

19:14.611 --> 19:17.990
your great-grandfather Comet
won this back in '91.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.993
I was only 16 back then.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.955
Why am I lying to a dog?

19:28.625 --> 19:29.626
Hey, buddy.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.004
[muffled] Go away.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.590
What did he say?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.843
I think he said "nose spray."

19:39.553 --> 19:41.388
Why would he say "nose spray"?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.057
I don't know. Maybe he's congested.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.311
I said, "Go away."

19:47.811 --> 19:48.729
[pants]

19:48.812 --> 19:50.022
We need an elevator.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.608
What did I miss?

19:52.691 --> 19:54.902
Well, he's not congested.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.030
Jackson, I promise,

19:58.113 --> 19:59.865
the pain will go away.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.993
And before you know it,
someone new will come along.

20:03.911 --> 20:04.786
It's true.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.831
Right after my boyfriend and I broke up,
I met Jimmy.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.210
Yeah, and after Steve and I broke up,
I met your father.

20:11.293 --> 20:15.339
And now that you and Lola broke up,
she'll meet someone wonderful, too.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.009
Oh! And so will you.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.721
[Danny] Ladies, I...

20:23.180 --> 20:25.599
I think Jackson needs
a man's point of view.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.184
That's a good idea.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.727
I'll go get Fernando.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.230
I'm talking about me.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.941
I know. You're always talking about you.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.944
OK, Dad. Give it a shot.

20:37.027 --> 20:37.861
Thanks.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.074
Look, kiddo.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.076
I know you're hurting.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.870
But sometimes people
just aren't meant to be together.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.081
And from what I could see,

20:49.164 --> 20:50.749
Lola was taking you for granted.

20:51.708 --> 20:54.169
Did she ever thank you
for all the little things you did?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.087
No.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.631
I worked on my "Copacabana" moves
for three weeks,

20:57.714 --> 21:00.008
and she just cha-cha-ed
right on out of my life.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.636
That's what I'm talking about.

21:02.719 --> 21:06.056
And did she ever once thank you
for dust-busting the vacuum cleaner?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.224
Did she even notice?

21:08.141 --> 21:10.269
Why would anyone dust-bust a vacuum?

21:11.186 --> 21:15.565
And did she even appreciate when you
replaced her toothbrush every four months

21:15.649 --> 21:18.485
as recommended
by the American Dental Association?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.196
[Jackson] Grandpa, are you OK?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.990
I waxed my back for her.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.410
You waxed your back for Lola?

21:27.536 --> 21:28.745
For Lola?

21:28.829 --> 21:30.289
No, no.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.832
For my ex-wife, Teri.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.293
Wait a second. Did you just say "ex-wife"?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.671
Grandpa, you got a divorce?

21:37.754 --> 21:40.173
Yeah. Sorry. I got a little off track.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.508
It won't happen again.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.846
You're gonna meet someone new
that's gonna love your back the way it is.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.431
Man, I can't let it go.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.184
Look. Do me a favor, by the way.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.438
This stuff about Teri.
Can we just keep this between you and me?

21:54.521 --> 21:55.897
Your secret is safe with me.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.650
And those three ladies right over there.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.281
Dad, why didn't you tell us
that you and Teri split up?

22:05.157 --> 22:08.452
Yeah. You always taught us
to talk about our problems.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.829
Yeah, but that's
when they were your problems.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.749
Truth is I was embarrassed.

22:14.374 --> 22:16.626
I've been living at the Ramada
for six weeks.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.712
But you guys seemed so happy.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.882
That one time she came up here.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.928
I mean, when we got married,
we didn't really even know each other.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.222
Then we found out
we just weren't compatible.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.682
[Jackson] Grandpa, don't worry.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.560
Someday, you'll find someone
who loves you...

22:34.102 --> 22:35.187
and your hairy back.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.647
Thanks, kid.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.149
I think.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.737
[sighs]

22:43.820 --> 22:44.738
[Stephanie] Dad.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.823
We feel so bad.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.911
Oh, thanks, Steph. It's all right.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.081
It feels good to finally get it out
in the open.

22:54.164 --> 22:57.042
Well, just so you know,
we're on your side, no matter what.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.337
You can always come to us,
about anything.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.090
Yeah. No matter how embarrassing
or pathetic.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.927
I know you're kind of messy, but...

23:07.677 --> 23:08.887
I really need a hug.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.055
Of course.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.225
-From my family. From my family, please.
-[Kimmy] Of course.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.143
Kimmy, get off of me.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.144
No, you love it.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.146
What are you still doing here?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.357
I felt bad about the way we left things.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.236
And I just want to say,
you're my best friend.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.363
And you're like my brother.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.240
I'm caught in the middle here.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.993
I don't want to have to choose
because that's way too much pressure.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.872
So, whatever you guys do, just remember...

23:36.623 --> 23:37.791
The real victim here...

23:37.874 --> 23:38.708
is me.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.879
I really want to be your friend.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.256
Do you hate me?

23:44.339 --> 23:46.466
No, no, no. I don't hate you.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.385
You're my first girlfriend.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.553
And my first kiss.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.681
But I'm just gonna need some time
to get over us.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.724
Look, you're a great guy.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.518
You're kind and sweet.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.937
You just need to give a girl a little room
to breathe.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.939
So you're saying you want
to get back together?

24:01.022 --> 24:01.857
No.

24:03.441 --> 24:04.484
We're just friends.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.611
Who occasionally make out?

24:06.695 --> 24:07.529
No.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.323
Dude took a shot.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.118
Well...

24:13.702 --> 24:14.870
I guess this is it.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.037
I guess it is.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.581
Goodbye, Lola.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.416
Bye, Jackson.

24:22.169 --> 24:24.045
Wait. Where are you going?

24:24.129 --> 24:27.841
Oh, Ramona invited me to stay
for fireworks. I'll see you out there.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.385
[Ramona] I'll be right there.

24:31.845 --> 24:32.679
Are you OK?

24:32.762 --> 24:33.972
Yeah.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.974
For my first breakup, I handled it well.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.435
Now I'm ready for my first rebound.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.814
So... Which one of your friends
thinks I'm hot? Kaci?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.149
-No.
-Carmen?

24:44.232 --> 24:45.483
-No.
-Lisa?

24:45.567 --> 24:47.277
-Out of your league.
-Piper?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.529
Piper is Lisa's mom.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.991
I know. But does she think I'm hot?

24:56.578 --> 24:57.787
[DJ] They're starting!

24:58.496 --> 25:00.332
[all] Ooh!

25:01.541 --> 25:03.418
Aah!

25:04.419 --> 25:05.670
Ooh!
