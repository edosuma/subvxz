>> Okay, there's something going

01:45.739 --> 01:49.541

weird message from the TV.

Would you be interested in
signing up for the science club
excursion to watch the solar

eclipse in exactly 24 hours?
>> Both: 24 hours?
>> What exactly happens

02:07.261 --> 02:11.230
in a solar eclipse?
>> The sun will be engulfed
by the moon and the world will

02:11.232 --> 02:14.967
be thrust into a complete
and unnatural darkness.
>> Whoa!

02:14.969 --> 02:19.104
And, uh, is this going to be,
like, like a bad thing?
>> Well, the Mayans believed

02:19.106 --> 02:22.508
that it would signify the end of
the world.
But of course, that was before

02:22.510 --> 02:28.380

>> Both: The end of the world!
>> Yes, but obviously it is just

24 hours is actually quite
a long time.

>> Hey, you're right.
How many minutes are there
in an hour? Like, 60?

03:00.347 --> 03:06.118
So, that's like 60 times 24,
which is...
Three billion seconds!

asked you -- but what do you
wanna do with your life?

>> Well, i guess what makes me

03:18.832 --> 03:22.834
happy is helping other people
who are less fortunate than
ourselves due to circumstances

So, I'd like to start a charity
for --

where are you going?
>> Dude, i don't think the end
of the world is time to get

03:30.644 --> 03:33.645

And besides, you were getting
kinda boring.

03:33.647 --> 03:40.686
I think we'd be better off doing
some of the things<i> i</i> wanna do.
>> Pbbt!

03:40.688 --> 03:44.690
Darwin, what are we doing here?
>> Learning hard.
So we can get a career, a home,

03:44.692 --> 03:48.393
and feed our children in the
future.
>> Darwin! There is no future!

03:48.395 --> 03:52.164

now.
>> Wedding?

04:52.760 --> 04:58.030
>> Yes, Darwin. My wedding.
>> By the power of the banana,
it is my duty to ask if there's

why gumball and Patty should not
be joined in marriage.

Speak now, or forever hold
your peace.
>> Actually, I've got more than

05:06.840 --> 05:11.076
one reason.
Firstly, I'm 12 and so are you.
Secondly, you didn't even

05:11.078 --> 05:14.680

You're just trying to marry me
in the school corridor.

>> Hey, guys! Happy wedding!
>> And finally, this is not
a wedding ring.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.355
It's a bagel.
You know what?
That shouldn't stop you from

05:23.357 --> 05:30.429
asking me again in 20 years.
>> [ Gasps ]
But you don't have 20 years.

to let her know the truth.

a perm?
>> It's just something I've

always wanted to do.
So, mom, under normal
circumstances, how long do you

05:47.081 --> 05:51.083

>> Well, your grandfather lived
to be 102.

>> Hmm, that's at least 90 more
birthday presents.

an offer you can't refuse.

>> Nothing.
Do you want a tutu with that?
>> If i get you a pony, you'd

06:14.475 --> 06:18.543

>> Not an issue.
>> Okay, I'll get you a pony...

06:18.545 --> 06:22.681

>> Have you tried to do

something about it?!
>> Well, gumball got a perm
and tried to get married,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.494
and mostly ate ice cream on
a roller coaster.
>> That's not what I'm talking

That every moment of our life

about?
>> Anais: It's the dress.
>> Gumball: What?!

16:35.729 --> 16:39.464

have loved at all.
