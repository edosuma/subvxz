WEBVTT

00:18.268 --> 00:19.686
So let me get this straight.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.938
You guys are actually mad
that I killed Professor Pyg?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.815
We don't kill people.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.400
There's always another way.

00:25.483 --> 00:27.027
You would rather
have me stand by

00:27.110 --> 00:29.320
while Nightwing dies
a brutal buttless death?

00:29.446 --> 00:30.739
Yes, yes.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.698
Gotham would mourn me
and my glistening apple bottom.

00:32.824 --> 00:37.620
But the number one rule
in this family is "no killing."

00:37.704 --> 00:40.623
Well, then, that's on you guys
for not telling me.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.666
[all sigh]

00:48.089 --> 00:49.341
Hmm.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.592
[computer beeping]

00:50.675 --> 00:52.260
You know, I think
it's one of those things

00:52.344 --> 00:53.720
that you never notice
until it's pointed out,

00:53.845 --> 00:56.264
and now I can never
not notice it, so, my bad.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.892
♪ Don't kill, no killing ♪

00:59.017 --> 01:01.770
♪ Don't kill, no killing ♪

01:01.853 --> 01:03.104
Songs stick in this old bean.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.647
You should have started
with the fish.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.692
[theme music playing]

01:12.405 --> 01:14.491
We're live with the mayor
and Poison Ivy.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.951
Girl, what the heck
is going on?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.703
Oh, girl. [clears throat]

01:18.787 --> 01:21.247
Um, so I'm, uh,
leading an initiative

01:21.373 --> 01:25.418
to replace all the male trees
in Gotham with female trees.

01:25.543 --> 01:29.881
Big J, as a male, [chuckles]
are you gonna stand for that?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.675
[chuckling] Of course, Tawny.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.843
It's female trees
that produce fruit

01:33.926 --> 01:37.222
and free fruit for the people
is peachy keen.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.890
[laughing]

01:39.015 --> 01:41.935
But since this is a co-pro
with the Legion of Doom,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.563
I'd appreciate a heads-up
on what the evil twist is.

01:45.689 --> 01:49.776
Ooh, ooh. I mean, give us
the juice with extra pulp.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.194
No twist.

01:51.277 --> 01:52.320
You know,
we're just a corporation

01:52.404 --> 01:53.863
endearing itself to the city.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.699
So, whoo! [chuckles awkwardly]

01:55.782 --> 01:57.826
You can't leave me
out of the twist!

01:57.908 --> 01:58.952
I'm the mayor.

01:59.077 --> 01:59.994
[Harley shouting] Ivy!

02:00.078 --> 02:01.204
Yo!

02:01.287 --> 02:03.081
Ivy's not visiting
with spectators.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.166
Nora, it's me, come on, Harley,

02:05.250 --> 02:08.669
the person who convinced you
not to get a neck tattoo
that said "queef queen."

02:08.752 --> 02:10.547
[sucks teeth]
I don't see you on the list.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.008
That's a Mama Macaroni's
takeout menu.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.426
Wait, garlic nubs are back?

02:14.509 --> 02:16.928
[shouting] Ivy, Mama Mac's
for date night?

02:17.053 --> 02:18.596
Mwah--

02:18.680 --> 02:20.432
What are you d...
No, you can't blow kisses
to villains.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.600
Why are you even
at an LOD event?

02:22.726 --> 02:25.937
I am here romantically,
not professionally,

02:26.021 --> 02:27.772
but I've got my crimey eyes
wide open, okay?

02:27.897 --> 02:29.441
I just gave
a very menacing look

02:29.524 --> 02:30.775
to a guy who almost littered.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.361
I am totally
representing the Fam. See?

02:33.445 --> 02:34.863
You have to earn
your Bat outfit.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.240
You can't just go buy one
at a Halloween store.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.908
Well, this is from a sex shop,
okay?

02:38.992 --> 02:39.951
Not okay.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.286
I'm getting texts about you

02:41.411 --> 02:42.620
when we were this close

02:42.704 --> 02:44.581
to luring Drunkula
out of his coffin.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.042
You know, this is on us
for never properly
training you.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.585
Oh, cool, cool, okay.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.295
Am... Am... Am I gonna train
with a pack of wolves?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.088
Take a vow of silence
and live with monks
in the mountains

02:52.172 --> 02:53.590
learning to gossip nonverbally?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.966
I have to be
Alfred's assistant?

02:56.091 --> 02:58.845
It's the best way
to reshape your Bat instincts.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.473
You'll get to know
the Bat Family
from the ground up.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.933
I am so excited for you, babe.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.060
Don't you "babe" me.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.936
-[alarm blaring]
-We gotta go.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.481
Rainbow Raider's taken over
the Gotham Candy Expo.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.733
God, that sounds awesome!

03:11.816 --> 03:13.193
To stop.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.738
Don't worry, we'll have plenty
of our own excitement here.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.739
Come.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.992
[beeping]

03:22.994 --> 03:24.704
Yeah.

03:24.829 --> 03:28.166
Let's begin by learning
the proper way
to steep Earl Grey.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.668
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.671
There's nothing I can learn
from a saggy old butler.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.761
Nora, Harley and I
were just making garganelli

03:39.844 --> 03:41.638
and the handle popped off
the pasta maker.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.682
Could you just call the company
and get it fixed?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.683
Probably not.

03:44.808 --> 03:45.642
Nora.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.686
[sighs dramatically]

03:50.522 --> 03:52.232
[Bane] Why, hello, Nora.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.358
[table creaking]

03:53.483 --> 03:55.067
[Bane grunts] Oh, dear.

03:55.192 --> 03:58.905
That was an intentional goof
to liven your spirits.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.366
Bane, do you happen to know
any big, strong men

04:01.491 --> 04:03.660
who'd want to help me
with a big, strong task?

04:03.743 --> 04:07.247
[Bane] I do know one. It is me.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.040
Great.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.376
I need you to fix
the handle of this pasta maker
for Ivy ASAP.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.045
[Bane] Pasta maker!
We meet again!

04:14.170 --> 04:15.797
I will handle it.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.382
Pun intended.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.344
Now that Operation Lady Trees
has begun,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.222
let's-- Let's discuss
the evil twist.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.890
-[Frank] That's
the shit I'm talking about.
-[all agreeing]

04:25.974 --> 04:28.435
Wayne Pharmaceuticals
has been destroying

04:28.560 --> 04:31.396
baby plants for use
in their medications.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.899
So now,
we are going to destroy them.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.152
-[all agreeing]
-I just got chills
down my stem.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.404
Back in the 1930s,

04:39.529 --> 04:42.282
Gotham City only planted
male trees

04:42.365 --> 04:45.118
because they didn't drop
"gunky girl stuff."

04:45.243 --> 04:47.203
But male trees cause allergies

04:47.287 --> 04:51.041
because they are always
jizzing pollen everywhere.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.376
So if we remove all male trees,

04:53.460 --> 04:56.713
we destroy
the allergy medicine market

04:56.796 --> 04:59.090
and bankrupt
Wayne Pharmaceuticals.

04:59.215 --> 05:03.219
[Firefly] Okay,
why not just rain fire
down upon them with a bomb?

05:03.303 --> 05:06.765
Volcana, would you please
switch seats with Firefly?

05:06.890 --> 05:10.643
Thank you so much.
I won't let you down, ma'am.

05:10.769 --> 05:14.939
Wow. Everything's so much
bigger and brighter up here.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.524
[gags and gasps]

05:16.608 --> 05:19.027
Oh, God. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.364
Nora, where...
Where were we with the rest
of the tree removal permits?

05:22.447 --> 05:23.573
The mayor won't approve them.

05:23.656 --> 05:24.532
Something about hating you?

05:24.616 --> 05:26.117
Fucking purple ball sack.

05:26.201 --> 05:30.789
It would be my greatest honor
to burn Mayor Joker alive

05:30.914 --> 05:31.998
for you.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.417
Hey, I got a doll thing
for a Poison Ivan.

This is a big-ass deal.

who are more at your level.

you're crushing it at the LOD.

fully crushed yet.

have to kill the mayor.

my approval on everything?

10:07.941 --> 10:10.735
-Eons ago, when Bruce
and I were entangled...
-[glass breaking]

10:10.819 --> 10:12.237
...in our passionate
love affair,

10:12.362 --> 10:14.572

of Wayne Enterprises.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.700
He's in jail.
The stock plummeted.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.451
-So, here I am.
-[Harley sniffs]

10:18.576 --> 10:22.831
Oh, wow. You smell
like those expensive pears
wrapped in foil.

10:22.914 --> 10:26.584
Bruce's vigilante cosplay hobby
has pulled funds
from important ventures

10:26.668 --> 10:29.462
like creating shell companies
that control shell companies

10:29.587 --> 10:32.215
that fund wars
that determine world politics.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.258
So from now on,

10:33.341 --> 10:35.885
all of your Bat bullshit
goes through me.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.096
And there will be cuts.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.432
Thanks, but I've got
everything under control here.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.268
Actually, I've got
everything under control.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.645
Think of me
as your new Bat Daddy.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.439
Hello.
Harley Quinn, new member.

10:47.522 --> 10:50.191
Do you have the power
to approve people
for active Bat duty?

10:50.275 --> 10:51.234
[Bat Family] No.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.318
Ugh!

10:52.402 --> 10:53.778
Were the scones not perfect?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.071
-What else do you want from me?
-[plate shatters]

have a lot to learn.

[growls and gobbles]

10:58.742 --> 11:01.453
Will you be
taking care of your son
now that you've returned?

11:01.536 --> 11:02.704
Yes.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.040
Where is my handsome
baby boy, huh?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.124
I'm right here, Mother.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.585
Damian? Out of diapers already?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.711
How long has it been?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.048
Benicio's going to be
so jealous

11:13.131 --> 11:15.091
I got to sit in the LOD box.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.470
You know, he leads
his rec team in assists.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.013
Like a young John Stockton.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.183
Oh, yeah.
I, like, love, like, hooping.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.644
You know, just, like, looking
at the ball and, like...

11:26.728 --> 11:30.565
[clears throat] So,
circling back about this
whole, like, permit snafu...

11:30.648 --> 11:33.318
Um, about
your plan's evil twist?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.488
Oh, well, obviously, like,
I can't tell you everything,

11:36.571 --> 11:37.906
but...

11:37.989 --> 11:40.283
If the mayor's office
approves the permits,

11:40.367 --> 11:43.203
we can replace every
male tree by Wednesday
and then we'll--

11:43.328 --> 11:46.373
[cackling]
Wednesday, of course.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.500
Hit 'em in the middle
of the week.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.834
So evil.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.462
God, it feels good to be
on the inside again.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.214
[cackles] Here.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.092
Happy to play my part
in your devilish scheme.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.720
On Wednesday.
[laughing maniacally]

12:02.013 --> 12:06.017
The tagline is "Your mailman
will appreciate it!"

12:06.142 --> 12:08.019
to encourage people
to ship more

12:08.144 --> 12:10.021
by preying on their love
of their mailman.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.231

12:11.356 --> 12:12.691
-One moment.
-[cell phone beeps]

12:12.816 --> 12:14.484

gave me the permits.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.777
Sorry, who is this?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.862
Oh, sorry. Um, this...
It's... It's Ivy.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.656
I'm fucking with you, Ivy.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.366
Of course it worked.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.827
He'll never notice
you've got your hand
so far up his ass

12:23.910 --> 12:26.538
that you're playing
his vocal chords
like an upright bass.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.499

Talia, seriously, I d--

12:29.582 --> 12:31.543
You know, I almost didn't come
to that fucking luncheon?

Because of the dollhouse?

12:32.961 --> 12:35.171
Yes, because of the d--
It was so--

12:35.255 --> 12:37.757
An embarrassing display
of outdated
third-wave feminism?

12:37.882 --> 12:40.969
Okay, so, exactly. [laughs]

12:41.052 --> 12:43.054
The EWBC women
aren't intellectuals,

12:43.138 --> 12:45.181
but they've all succeeded
in the world of men.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.143
I respect that.
And the tote bags are fun.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.020

13:09.748 --> 13:12.208

and now I'm off to fight crime.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.878

or I'll have to fuck you up.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.546

13:24.554 --> 13:27.265
Miss Harley. I understand
why Master Wayne chose you,

13:27.390 --> 13:29.100
but the other people
in this manor

13:29.184 --> 13:30.977

with impulsivity.

you can do things their way.

Be a bitch.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.444
Yeah, I tried that

13:39.569 --> 13:41.446
and I just got maced
with all-surface cleaner.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.533
Yes, but I'm talking
about B-I-T-C-H.

Handle it.

BITCH.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.958
I use it when I'm deciding
whether or not

13:54.042 --> 13:58.463
to give the long goodbye
to any of Master Bruce's
unsuitable paramours.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.632
Huh. Just be a bitch.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.050
Thanks, Alfie. Wait a minute.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.427
Didn't you say shortcuts
are the same as cheating?

14:04.511 --> 14:05.804
[gasps] Are you dying?

14:05.929 --> 14:07.138
In a way.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.807
Talia is on the brink
of firing me.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.308
And who can blame her?

14:10.392 --> 14:12.435
My work has lost meaning
with Master Bruce in jail.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.520
But don't worry about me.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.189

said it would fix
my permit problems.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.561
[laughing maniacally]

19:07.772 --> 19:08.773
Whoo!

19:09.482 --> 19:10.734
[tires screech]

19:12.819 --> 19:14.154
[pleasant music playing]

19:21.828 --> 19:22.912
Ha!

19:22.996 --> 19:25.248
[squealing]

19:25.331 --> 19:26.750
My, it's getting nippy.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.461
Friendship beanies.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.216
[Alfred] Okay, last errand.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.302
I just have to put a gun
in a safe deposit box.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.261
Back in a jiff.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.472
See ya, loser.

19:40.555 --> 19:43.516
Love ya, Ive. Damn,
my lady makes a juicy plum.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.273
Hey, same hat. We're hat twins.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.941
Ugh, okay? Uh, rude.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.194
[alarm ringing]

19:55.362 --> 19:56.488
[tires screech]

19:56.613 --> 19:58.990
Wait a minute. BITCH.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.242
B, breathe. [inhales]

20:01.326 --> 20:03.328
I, identify the problem.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.080
Talia's on the brink
of firing me.

20:05.163 --> 20:09.501
I want to see if you can
take that corner
at 60 miles per hour.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.836
I just have to put a gun
in a safe deposit box.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.799
Alfred Pennyworth,
you sneaky little minx.

20:15.882 --> 20:16.966
You're robbing a bank!

20:17.050 --> 20:19.052
[yelps] And I'm
the getaway driver, ah!

20:19.177 --> 20:20.637
T, tea break. [slurps]

20:20.720 --> 20:22.097
Damn,
this is perfectly steeped.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.556
C, consider your options.

20:23.682 --> 20:27.769
H, time to handle this shit.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.773
Would you be so kind
as to add a few more
thousand to my attache?

20:31.856 --> 20:34.442
The jig is up, Alfred.
Drop the gun.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.860
I'm afraid I can't do that.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.154
Well, I can't let you
rob a freakin' bank.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.280
I'm calling for backup.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.573
I will not be stopped.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.200
Desperate times
call for desperate--

20:42.283 --> 20:43.535
Hey, look over there.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.538
[grunts]

20:46.621 --> 20:48.665
-[Alfred grunts]
-Why are you doing this?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.376
[Alfred grunting]

20:51.459 --> 20:52.794
Alfred, stop!

20:55.046 --> 20:56.381
Necktie, now!

20:58.883 --> 21:00.719
Stop!
What the hell are you doing?

21:00.844 --> 21:03.388
-I was just--
-You traitor.
You robbed a bank?

21:03.513 --> 21:05.724
I did indeed. Take me away.

21:05.849 --> 21:09.269
Harley, I'd never expect you
to rat on a friend.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.730
But that kind of clear,
decisive thinking

21:11.813 --> 21:14.065
is exactly what
hero instincts are.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.650
You're back on the team.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.569
Wow.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.863
And all I had to do
was narc on the only person
who's been supportive of me?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.157
[chuckles] Why didn't
you tell me earlier?

21:22.240 --> 21:23.575
You've earned your Bat outfit.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.410
Snitches get stitches.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.746
You guys, it's gorge!

21:27.829 --> 21:29.581
Wait till Ivy sees me in this,
which she won't.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.082
Not in a personal
sex situation,

21:31.207 --> 21:33.335
only in an impersonal
work situation, of course.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.507
Bye, bitch.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.512
[Alfred humming]

21:47.390 --> 21:50.018
Oh, dear, wrinkle.
That won't do.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.937
Gramps, if you fold
that tea towel one more time,

21:53.063 --> 21:55.398
your neck can
kiss your head goodbye.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.275
My apologies.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.028
I'm just trying
to fold it exactly how
Master Bruce prefers it

22:00.111 --> 22:01.529
for our big reunion.

22:01.613 --> 22:02.864
[tires screech]

22:07.410 --> 22:08.745
This isn't Blackgate.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.456
Blackgate's for people
with stock portfolios.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.957
Everyone else has to go through

22:13.083 --> 22:15.794
the "social rehabilitation"
program at New Arkham.

22:15.877 --> 22:18.421
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Leave your tea towels
on the van.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.006
Oh, dear.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.092
[theme music playing]

22:42.946 --> 22:44.489
