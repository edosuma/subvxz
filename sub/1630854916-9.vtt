01:15.480 --> 01:17.560
Where is Julian Wright?

01:18.320 --> 01:21.160
He's not here! It's
just us and the children.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.360
No, no! Look out!

01:23.360 --> 01:25.400
Wait!

02:17.480 --> 02:19.560
That was my father's.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.080
Why do you have it?

02:27.920 --> 02:31.880
I found it in the
rubble when I saved you.

02:34.200 --> 02:39.600
I grabbed it, thinking
you might want it sometime.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
What's going on?

04:03.480 --> 04:05.560
Sarah, what's going on?

04:09.520 --> 04:11.600
Talk to me.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.360
I don't know, it's-

04:15.360 --> 04:17.400
I just-

04:18.200 --> 04:20.720
Sarah, talk to me. It's
the middle of the night.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.760
What's going on?

04:24.720 --> 04:28.320
I had this... this weird dream.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.080
About what?

04:33.720 --> 04:35.800
About John.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.280
He wanted to kill you.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.440
We all have bad dreams.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.120
Eh...

04:48.120 --> 04:49.480
Just...

04:49.480 --> 04:53.760
He ain't gonna kill me. Don't
worry about that, trust me.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.680
I feel like he changed.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.240
Yes, he did. He changed. He's
scared. That's why he changed.

05:03.840 --> 05:09.080
You built something special
here. He doesn't wanna lose it.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.120
Don't worry.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.680
So you're on his side?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.520
No, I'm past sides now.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.640
Come here.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.200
I have to go four days in
the mountains. No eating.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.960
No drinking.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.440
I did it too, when I
decided to stay here.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.440
Tawny Bear told me it's the
only way to become a Comanche,

06:12.440 --> 06:15.760
and learning the language of course.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.320
You learned my language very well.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.120
So did you.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.240
Do you remember
the day you saved my life?

06:25.480 --> 06:27.560
They could've killed you.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.240
But you weren't afraid to die.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.640
I was, and I still am every day.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.920
You were a boy.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.400
A child leaves behind
a bright light when they die.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.080
When I am no longer here,

06:53.080 --> 06:55.240
there'll be only darkness.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.000
Tawny Bear wants a word.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.520
Five bears...

07:47.520 --> 07:50.320
is about to become a man

07:50.320 --> 07:53.080
and he never would've become one

07:53.080 --> 07:55.120
if it wasn't for you.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.680
I want to make
sure you remember that.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.400
Can I see that?

10:15.760 --> 10:18.360
What's going on here, John?

10:18.360 --> 10:21.240
Hey, we're having ourselves
a little celebration.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.520
In honor of Kevin and
Sarah's safe return.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.400
And our continued perseverance.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.280
This one's ready.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.520
Who's invited?

10:32.520 --> 10:36.640
Well, everybody, like always.
Our gates will be open.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.720
It's hard to imagine I'm
the first one to tell you

10:39.720 --> 10:42.720
this is not your greatest idea.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.520
Now what's the point in having
a paradise if we can't share it

10:45.520 --> 10:47.200
with the world?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.800
John, the world outside
wants to kill us.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.960
These walls haven't stopped that.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.160
In fact, they probably made it worse.

10:55.160 --> 11:00.200
I want people to come, see our guns,
see our watchmen, see our towers.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.240
Let 'em know we're not goin' anywhere.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.840
And what about security?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.840
Same as usual. No knives, no guns.

11:07.840 --> 11:13.080
Don't you want a chance to dance
and drink, and exorcise those demons?

11:13.080 --> 11:15.360
Exorcise those demons, John?

11:16.720 --> 11:19.320
Relax, friend. It's just a party.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.200
Don't worry, friend, we'll
have sentries everywhere.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.960
We've done this before...

11:29.960 --> 11:32.360
Do you agree with this madness?

11:33.640 --> 11:35.880
I think this town needs this.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.200
These your words or his?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.120
Sir, wait.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.160
Do you have any quinine tincture?

12:22.880 --> 12:24.400
It's gonna cost you a lot of money.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.000
I don't have money, but...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.480
I've this.

12:29.480 --> 12:33.960
It's valuable. It's been in
my family for two generations.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.040
Why you selling it?

12:37.040 --> 12:40.240
Because staying alive is more important.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.960
Young lady, let me ask you something.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.480
What do you think you're
gonna do with no money,

12:56.480 --> 13:02.040
no guns, and no food, in
that bloody patch of dirt?

13:02.040 --> 13:04.080
Build a city.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.040
It'll be the greatest city in the world.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.120
I wanted to surprise you.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.640
I'm certainly surprised.

13:23.280 --> 13:27.240
What good is this all for
if we can't celebrate life?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.840
We can't spend the
rest of our days hiding.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.720
I thought that's
exactly what you wanted.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.840
We need to work for
the good of our people.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.920
Being locked up ain't good for anybody.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.440
I shouldn't have left like that.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.000
It was stupid,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.680
childish.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.720
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.880
And I was out of my head.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.000
I still am, Sarah.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.360
But in a different way.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.800
A better one.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.240
Carnival.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.280
Yeah, why not?

14:29.640 --> 14:32.800
Carnival turns everything upside down.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.040
Just the way we like it.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.840
What are you doing?

15:08.640 --> 15:11.160
I'm going to New Babylon.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.840
Why?

15:13.840 --> 15:17.160
They're organizing a big
party to show the world

15:17.160 --> 15:19.440
that the anti-Christ has won.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.840
Who told you?

15:22.840 --> 15:25.200
The Lord.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.000
Today he said to me
that the time has come

15:29.000 --> 15:31.720
to wash away John Ellis's sins.

15:31.720 --> 15:36.360
And you sure it's God and
not just your broken heart?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.760
Well, son. It's probably both.

15:40.560 --> 15:44.000
You're the only one I
have left on this earth.

15:55.920 --> 15:59.880
Daddy was right, you
ain't fit to be a mother.

15:59.880 --> 16:04.480
Your daddy was a liar,
just like my old man.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.840
A mediocre, vulgar pig. A
slave to his own weakness.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.320
What did you love about him, then?

16:10.320 --> 16:13.440
I didn't love him, I despised him.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.520
I only loved one man in my entire life.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.680
A man who seduced me,
knowing he was my brother.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.560
And with the same excuse he manipulated

16:22.560 --> 16:25.160
my father to steal my land.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.720
A man who's not a man, but a...

16:27.720 --> 16:30.880
handsome incarnation of the devil.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.840
Do you even realize that
you're gonna stick your head

16:34.840 --> 16:37.600
in the lion's mouth?

16:37.600 --> 16:41.240
You don't even care that
you might not come back.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.120
Do ya?

16:46.480 --> 16:50.200
Whoever wants to save
their life, will lose it.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.960
And whoever loses their
life for me, will save it.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.600
It says it in the Bible.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.080
I need to face Satan, my son.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.360
And if I die,

17:06.240 --> 17:09.040
I will wait for you on the other side.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.240
Please be careful, Mama.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.920
She's headed to New Babylon.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.320
Why?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.720
I'm worried she's gonna kill 'em all.

18:10.720 --> 18:14.440
Your father, your brothers...

18:14.440 --> 18:16.520
...and her.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.240
The first guests are
approaching the gates.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.640
Is security ready?

18:29.640 --> 18:32.200
We should get a few more men to help
search, you know keep the line...

18:32.200 --> 18:34.080
I'm not talking to you,
I'm talking to your brother.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.600
- Besides, you need to rest.
- I'm fine, you know? I wanna help.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.400
You wanna help?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.240
Help by listening to me next time.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.280
I'll take care of it.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.200
All right.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.520
Well, let's not make a few
raindrops spoil our fun.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.720
Come on, you deserve some fun.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.160
Listen.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.680
The next time one of them comes for us,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.720
you'll be ready.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.600
I know you would've saved her.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.720
Instead I was the one who needed saving.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.080
Or, I could've been dead.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.880
We both know that ain't true.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.520
Hmm.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.520
I've always admired that about you.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.040
You've always been like that.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.080
- Like what?
- Confident.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.280
I'm just older, that's all.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.240
Come on.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.120
Lucifer was the most beautiful,

20:22.120 --> 20:24.240
luminous angel of our Lord.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.840
But anyone who yields to his seduction

20:27.840 --> 20:29.800
will burn with him in hell.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.280
And you want us to enter his realm?

20:32.280 --> 20:34.760
Or not?

20:34.760 --> 20:39.240
When the time is right, we will
have all the weapons we need.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.480
Name.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.840
Whoo! Ahh!

22:51.520 --> 22:53.600
Whoo!

24:24.400 --> 24:26.480
Come on!

24:41.000 --> 24:44.080
Thought you'd be more pleased to see me.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.240
Why don't you sit down.

25:01.640 --> 25:05.440
Don't tell me you're getting
used to living in this pit of lust

25:05.440 --> 25:08.040
and non-believers?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.520
No, of course not.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.720
That's good.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.520
'Cause I need your help.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.000
Yeah. What can I do for you ma'am?

25:17.960 --> 25:21.680
I know this town is full of weapons.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.200
And you...

25:24.120 --> 25:26.960
...you're gonna show
me where they keep 'em.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.200
Yeah. Su... Sure. Yeah,
of course I can do that.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.960
I know how to get you weapons, ma'am.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.440
You see?

25:36.440 --> 25:38.680
You men of little faith.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.800
He's no traitor.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.760
He's my son's brother.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.800
His arms, his eyes, his blood.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.320
He's a part of the family.

25:48.320 --> 25:51.800
And in this family, we
stand up for each other.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.840
No matter what it costs.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.600
Let's begin the night of purification.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.440
Let's go.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.520
Put on...

29:43.520 --> 29:45.520
Put on the armor of God.

29:45.520 --> 29:49.280
Put on the armor of God so
you... so you can take your stand.

29:49.280 --> 29:53.480
So you can take your stand
against the devil's schemes.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.000
And return to the light of the Lord.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.600
Did you get all the weapons?

30:29.600 --> 30:31.640
Yes, ma'am.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.640
Now, follow me.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.680
Give me a drink.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.360
Haven't you had enough?

31:19.360 --> 31:21.520
Besides...

31:21.520 --> 31:23.560
there's nothing left.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.040
You always cared about me, Jess.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.240
Of course. You're our guide.

31:33.440 --> 31:35.520
Everyone loves you.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.320
I'm no one's guide. I'm not a saint.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.600
I'm not what everyone thinks I am.

31:44.600 --> 31:47.960
Am I a bad person if I think
there's something wrong with this?

31:47.960 --> 31:50.000
Hey. Come on.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.600
To bad people.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.080
Hide, I'll wait for him inside.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.920
You best stay right where you are.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.480
What are you doing here?

33:33.480 --> 33:36.240
This is my home. These are my people.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.360
So, you and your dogs
best leave my city.

33:42.360 --> 33:46.120
Well, well, well... Look
at the little Ellis boy.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.640
Finally standing up for
his degenerate family.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.280
Thinking that one day
he's gonna love you back.

33:56.280 --> 34:00.000
I'd rather suffer the
retribution of my family

34:00.000 --> 34:03.640
than to listen to any of
your sorcery any longer.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.360
I've seen who you really are.

34:10.760 --> 34:13.400
What you truly want.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.800
And I want nothin' to do with it.

34:17.240 --> 34:19.320
This all ends right now.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.120
Go.

34:23.120 --> 34:26.040
Or the first bullet'll be for you.

34:26.040 --> 34:29.680
Don't forget that I was
the one believing in you.

34:30.520 --> 34:33.320
I was the one who offered you a future.

34:33.320 --> 34:37.840
But it looks like you'd rather be
a slave to your daddy and his bitch.

34:37.840 --> 34:40.920
Watching from the shadows while she...

34:40.920 --> 34:44.760
...satisfies her passions
with him instead of you.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.680
Leave.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.560
Now!

34:50.560 --> 34:52.000
OK.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.040
I'm walking.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.160
I'm walking.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.480
- Slave.
- That's enough.

35:12.920 --> 35:14.640
Slave.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.360
I said... that's enough!

35:17.360 --> 35:19.400
Uh!

35:21.960 --> 35:24.040
Shit! Was that a gunshot?

35:25.720 --> 35:27.800
Stay here.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.120
We gotta go!

35:39.120 --> 35:41.600
It didn't sound like fireworks.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.360
Did you hear that? What's going on?

35:59.360 --> 36:01.400
I don't know.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.040
Hey! Hey!

36:18.000 --> 36:20.080
Let's go!

36:29.640 --> 36:31.640
Phillip.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.480
Uh!

36:33.480 --> 36:35.520
Help! Help!

36:38.960 --> 36:41.160
Phillip.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.200
I... I...

36:44.720 --> 36:46.960
Ph... Phillip, look at my face.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.280
It's gonna be alright.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.160
Oh, I know. I... I... I know. I got you.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.800
I'm right here, right?
Just keep looking at me.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.720
Just keep breathing, right? I got you.

37:01.240 --> 37:03.680
I'm goin... I'm going to see Mama.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.280
Phillip.

37:15.160 --> 37:19.000
Seymour. Seymour, open your eyes.

37:20.120 --> 37:24.280
- What happened here?
- She's gone. She was just here.

37:24.280 --> 37:26.320
She's gone.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.160
Seymour! What happened?

37:30.040 --> 37:32.640
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.680
You gotta get up. Come on.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.120
- What happened?
- Elizabeth was here.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.000
Okay... okay.

37:49.280 --> 37:51.360
Phillip, don't leave me.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.160
Phillip.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.560
Help.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.520
H... Hel... Help!

38:37.800 --> 38:41.240
It's OK, Seymour, it
just hit you on the side.

38:47.840 --> 38:48.960
Kevin, find Phillip.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.960
Tell him to check the compound.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.400
Pops.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.080
Come on, tell him to get his
men and have a look around.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.120
Elizabeth is here.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.840
I'm sorry for your loss.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.440
Thank you.

39:54.440 --> 39:56.480
Thank you very much.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.160
I'm so sorry.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.200
I'm sorry for your loss.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.080
Tonight...

42:04.080 --> 42:07.280
...their streets will
flow red with blood.
