01:25.478 --> 01:28.113
Well, there you go.

02:04.912 --> 02:06.080
No!

02:06.978 --> 02:09.310
No!

02:09.312 --> 02:12.409
Stop. You will do it for me,
and I'll let you go.

02:12.411 --> 02:13.944
Tell me.

02:13.946 --> 02:15.379
I'll do anything you want.

02:38.146 --> 02:39.379
Come here, boy.

02:40.913 --> 02:42.812
Good boy, Butterscotch.

02:48.578 --> 02:50.479
Do you have anything
I can give him?

02:52.878 --> 02:54.214
Anything sweet?

03:02.213 --> 03:03.509
Where did you get this?

03:03.511 --> 03:05.780
Someone left it on their
table at the diner.

03:06.813 --> 03:08.413
You can't give this to horses.

03:11.180 --> 03:12.746
What's it for?

03:13.979 --> 03:15.844
It's made out of
cactus or something.

03:15.846 --> 03:17.378
It's supposed to
open your mind.

03:18.445 --> 03:20.847
Good boy. Look at me.

03:26.312 --> 03:28.844
Do I look like a queen?

03:28.846 --> 03:31.877
'Cause I'm gonna be
a rodeo queen this year.

03:31.879 --> 03:35.544
I'm gonna win that crown and that
Chevrolet that comes with it.

03:35.546 --> 03:38.213
I'm gonna marry Taylor and
we're gonna get a big house.

03:38.879 --> 03:40.577
I believe it.

03:40.579 --> 03:44.013
I'm gonna tour the world,
I'm gonna be a star.

03:45.344 --> 03:46.812
You are a star.

03:51.479 --> 03:53.413
What are you gonna do
when I'm a star?

03:57.246 --> 03:59.376
Seriously, Heidi...

03:59.378 --> 04:01.779
You can't just live
at that truck stop.

04:02.913 --> 04:05.244
Work at that
freaking diner.

04:05.246 --> 04:09.080
Truckers winking at you,
pinching your ass.

04:10.378 --> 04:12.443
Don't you have any dreams?

04:12.445 --> 04:15.376
Yeah. But I like my job.

04:15.378 --> 04:17.178
It's better than
what I had before.

04:18.379 --> 04:19.879
Yeah, well,

04:20.577 --> 04:22.079
that's not enough.

06:34.845 --> 06:36.079
Look.

06:36.978 --> 06:39.242
- I did it.
- What is it?

06:39.244 --> 06:41.944
It's just my thumbprint
in some salt dough.

06:41.946 --> 06:44.979
Spread it with some gold
paint, stuck it on a chain.

06:46.079 --> 06:47.346
It's a necklace.

06:48.312 --> 06:50.980
So Taylor doesn't forget me
when he deploys.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.080
I don't think
he's gonna forget you.

07:03.578 --> 07:06.011
Hey, can you
drop me off here?

07:06.013 --> 07:07.980
- Here?
- Yeah.

07:16.178 --> 07:18.278
You want me to just leave you
here by the side of the road?

07:21.279 --> 07:23.309
I have a friend
picking me up.

07:23.311 --> 07:24.479
Who?

07:28.478 --> 07:30.376
You think you're
my only friend.

07:44.813 --> 07:45.847
Hey.

07:47.479 --> 07:49.046
You're my best friend.

07:49.578 --> 07:51.145
You know that, right?

07:53.913 --> 07:55.178
See you later.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.310
Can I get you anything else
for the time being?

08:47.312 --> 08:49.113
Your number, honey.

09:48.977 --> 09:50.145
Where have you been?

09:51.812 --> 09:53.543
Church.

09:53.545 --> 09:55.078
What did you ask Jesus for?

09:57.944 --> 09:59.880
I don't ask Jesus
for nothing.

10:01.077 --> 10:02.145
Right.

10:04.879 --> 10:06.012
Mmm.

10:07.579 --> 10:09.880
I did whisper
to the preacher once.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.880
I wanted the Holy Spirit
to fill me up.

10:15.412 --> 10:17.112
And be inside me.

10:20.311 --> 10:22.442
You know, everyone's lining up
to say stuff to the preacher

10:22.444 --> 10:24.544
and the girl
sitting next to me said

10:24.546 --> 10:27.243
that's what I should say.

10:27.245 --> 10:28.912
Did you say it wrong?

10:32.545 --> 10:33.912
I think so.

10:35.378 --> 10:37.512
He looked at me
with his bug eyes and said...

10:41.011 --> 10:44.379
"The just shall receive
by faith alone."

10:48.044 --> 10:49.779
You know, I do have faith.

10:50.944 --> 10:52.011
In what?

10:53.245 --> 10:55.846
I know how to get along
with this bad world.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.945
Can I get you anything else
for the time being?

11:23.812 --> 11:25.112
How long have you lived here?

11:26.379 --> 11:27.976
A while.

11:27.978 --> 11:31.109
Ever see this girl,
my Sarah?

11:31.111 --> 11:32.911
Just in the poster
we got here.

11:49.878 --> 11:51.079
I'm sorry.

11:54.878 --> 11:57.010
There's this new girl
that's missing,

11:57.012 --> 11:58.543
um, everybody's out
looking for her

11:58.545 --> 12:01.312
'cause she's some pretty,
rich girl from the city.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.146
Lorna Sage?

12:04.145 --> 12:05.379
You heard about her, right?

12:08.444 --> 12:10.979
Everybody's clean
forgotten about my Sarah.

12:12.145 --> 12:13.480
And she's still missing.

12:15.811 --> 12:16.978
She's my baby.

12:20.479 --> 12:21.846
I'm sorry.

12:38.345 --> 12:39.876
- Heidi.
- Hmm?

12:39.878 --> 12:41.079
This came for you, honey.

13:21.111 --> 13:22.513
Here you go, sir.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.480
Uh, thank...

13:48.579 --> 13:50.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:51.479 --> 13:53.480
I still have an hour
of my shift left.

13:55.912 --> 14:00.243
Well, I didn't have anything else to
do, so can I just hang out?

14:00.245 --> 14:02.209
- Sure. Do you want a beer?
- Yeah.

14:02.211 --> 14:03.911
Come.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.911
Are you done with this seat?

14:15.144 --> 14:16.345
So, what's up?

14:17.844 --> 14:19.145
I got a letter.

14:20.379 --> 14:22.177
From my father's sister.

14:22.179 --> 14:25.345
She lives near a Cap'corn,
beside the sea.

14:26.411 --> 14:27.445
Okay.

14:28.312 --> 14:29.946
She runs a hotel.

14:32.344 --> 14:35.178
She sounds so nice.

14:37.845 --> 14:39.943
She found me,
I don't even know how.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.112
So, when are you leaving?

14:46.444 --> 14:48.346
I'm not gonna leave.

14:49.379 --> 14:52.343
I might just
go visit her.

14:52.345 --> 14:53.812
Come on, Heidi.

14:54.546 --> 14:55.777
You should do it.

14:55.779 --> 14:58.843
It's no kind of life living
in that freaking truck stop,

14:58.845 --> 15:02.176
working at the diner and
hanging out with me, here.

15:02.178 --> 15:05.975
Pretty sure she can give you a
job, as well. Right?

15:05.977 --> 15:07.313
Maybe, but...

15:08.244 --> 15:09.746
I'd miss you, though.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.345
Yeah, um...

15:14.512 --> 15:16.346
I gotta keep on working.

15:18.211 --> 15:20.342
Do you wanna hang out later?
I mean, I...

15:20.344 --> 15:22.109
I can wait.
I'll give you a ride.

15:22.111 --> 15:24.810
I said I'd hang out
with Gus and Cherry later.

15:24.812 --> 15:27.243
I gotta clean up.
There's some real losers in here.

15:27.245 --> 15:29.412
- You're just gonna get hassled.
- I don't care.

15:30.444 --> 15:32.011
Okay. Well,

15:33.112 --> 15:34.413
see you in a bit.

16:02.144 --> 16:04.945
Such a bummer ball,
my husband.

16:05.945 --> 16:07.413
I just want to dance.

16:11.045 --> 16:12.413
He's here because of me.

16:13.977 --> 16:15.512
He'd do anything for me.

16:21.978 --> 16:23.480
Come here, baby.

16:24.479 --> 16:26.346
So, what's your story, Heidi?

16:27.045 --> 16:29.277
Hmm...

16:29.279 --> 16:31.179
Let me tell you
about Heidi.

16:32.311 --> 16:34.176
She came to Desert Dior

16:34.178 --> 16:36.975
with this real
piece-of-work boyfriend.

16:36.977 --> 16:39.278
Didn't you, Heidi? Mmm?

16:40.978 --> 16:42.112
Yeah.

16:43.212 --> 16:44.778
How long ago was that?

16:46.444 --> 16:48.313
It was almost five years.

16:49.278 --> 16:51.479
"Almost five years."

16:55.278 --> 16:59.010
We met at a bar, remember?

16:59.012 --> 17:01.143
I asked her
if she wanted to dance.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.512
I was drunk.

17:03.978 --> 17:05.246
I said yes.

17:10.577 --> 17:13.478
Yeah. I feel free
when I'm dancing.

17:14.511 --> 17:16.476
Heidi's a yes-girl.

17:16.478 --> 17:19.176
"Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am."

17:19.179 --> 17:21.576
Yes, Jane.

17:21.578 --> 17:24.443
Do you wanna try some?
Say yes, yes-girl.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.843
- It makes you know things.
- No.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.842
Yes. Yes, girl.

17:28.844 --> 17:30.478
- No. No!
- Yes, yes-girl.

17:32.012 --> 17:33.146
Whoa.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.078
No.

17:39.278 --> 17:41.379
Are we going to this
party in Clay City or what?

17:42.279 --> 17:43.379
Yeah.

17:49.844 --> 17:50.978
Yeah.

18:49.145 --> 18:51.812
Wake up, wake up,
wake up! Wake up. Look!

18:52.377 --> 18:54.043
Taylor proposed.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.911
Look.

18:58.444 --> 19:00.811
Can you see?
It's a dolphin.

19:03.377 --> 19:05.046
I opened the door,

19:05.911 --> 19:07.278
and he was on his knees.

19:08.945 --> 19:10.479
In his ACUs.

19:15.211 --> 19:17.076
Isn't that romantic?

19:17.078 --> 19:19.213
Yeah. It is.

19:20.912 --> 19:24.043
We have to get married
this weekend.

19:24.045 --> 19:28.542
He's going away.
It's the only chance we'll get.

19:28.544 --> 19:33.046
You know, there are all sorts of
benefits once you get married, Heidi.

19:34.443 --> 19:38.042
And I can go and live
in that base at Fort America.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.045
Have you ever seen
these houses?

19:41.011 --> 19:44.909
They're so freaking huge.

19:44.911 --> 19:48.311
Well, I'm not gonna have to
work in that casino anymore.

19:51.045 --> 19:53.512
Fort America's 100 miles away.

19:56.511 --> 19:59.179
No, it's like
an hour drive.

20:00.279 --> 20:03.179
Yeah, in a Black Hawk maybe.

20:08.244 --> 20:11.209
What do you care if I go
and live in Fort America?

20:11.211 --> 20:13.045
I won't ever see you.

20:14.477 --> 20:16.745
You're leaving town anyway.

20:17.645 --> 20:20.078
Jane, will you stop this?
I'm not leaving.

20:31.112 --> 20:32.478
I'm just saying.

20:48.443 --> 20:50.110
After you.

20:50.112 --> 20:51.411
Thank you.

20:56.845 --> 20:58.746
- Thank you.
- Bye.

20:59.944 --> 21:01.442
My God. Okay.

21:03.477 --> 21:06.210
What's happening, Taylor?

21:06.212 --> 21:08.843
Oh, my God.
Heidi, come here.

21:08.845 --> 21:11.142
Come, girl.
Are you kidding?

21:11.144 --> 21:12.943
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- Don't be mad.

21:12.945 --> 21:14.308
- I'm not... Oh, my God.
- Don't be mad.

21:14.310 --> 21:16.308
- I can take my truck. I'll get a ride.
- Thank you, Heidi.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.476
I cannot believe
this, Taylor.

21:17.478 --> 21:20.177
I cannot believe you would
do this on our wedding day!

21:20.179 --> 21:22.576
For God's sakes.

21:22.578 --> 21:24.342
- I can explain.
- What the hell happened?

21:24.344 --> 21:25.742
Can you tell me?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.375
The guys and I were doing some
donuts in the parking lot earlier.

21:27.377 --> 21:29.309
- Just don't be mad.
- On our wedding day?

21:29.311 --> 21:32.042
Are you freaking kidding me, Taylor?
What the hell's wrong with you?

21:32.044 --> 21:34.276
- Will you calm down?
- For sure.

21:34.278 --> 21:36.009
- You're gonna fix it, right?
- I'll fix it.

21:36.011 --> 21:37.308
Oh, well, you've said
that before.

21:37.310 --> 21:39.275
I've heard you say that
three weeks in a row.

21:39.277 --> 21:41.943
- And look at our car now.
- That's not even true. That didn't even happen.

21:41.945 --> 21:43.212
Jesus Christ.

21:44.211 --> 21:45.843
For God's sakes.

21:45.845 --> 21:47.746
For crying out loud,
Taylor, hurry up.

21:48.277 --> 21:50.542
Rainbow.

21:50.544 --> 21:52.745
I guess I'll take this
opportunity to give this to you.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.875
Thank you, sir.

21:55.877 --> 21:58.208
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.376
Okay, here it goes.

22:22.877 --> 22:25.311
I'm gonna
miss you so much.

22:27.378 --> 22:29.812
Yeah. Me too.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.177
It's you
I'm gonna be fighting for.

22:37.011 --> 22:39.112
You're not going
to a real war, Taylor.

22:39.444 --> 22:41.209
What?

22:41.211 --> 22:44.176
I said you're not going
to a real war, Taylor.

22:44.178 --> 22:47.208
You're just putting out fires
and starting new ones.

22:47.210 --> 22:49.408
It's all just pretend.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.344
I don't think
you know a lot about it.

22:53.310 --> 22:56.144
Well, I know things
without being told, you know?

22:58.111 --> 22:59.909
Like what?

22:59.911 --> 23:01.745
Like what your dreams are.

23:03.577 --> 23:05.078
What you are thinking.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.244
And what am I thinking?

23:12.011 --> 23:13.511
You're thinking...

23:16.578 --> 23:19.512
...about the life
we're gonna have together.

23:22.377 --> 23:24.845
You're right.
Yeah, I am.

23:27.343 --> 23:30.311
But you don't know
what I'm thinking.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.144
Do you?

23:35.577 --> 23:37.478
You don't have that gift.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.177
Can I help you?

24:22.044 --> 24:23.746
You wanna go out sometime?

24:31.111 --> 24:34.810
Oh, you can't think
of a reason to say no.

24:34.812 --> 24:38.746
I just didn't think it
would be polite to tell you.

24:40.143 --> 24:41.344
Something wrong with me?

24:44.043 --> 24:45.779
I'm sure you're fine.

24:46.977 --> 24:50.141
I got it.
You think I'm, um,

24:50.143 --> 24:51.377
a little too old for you.

24:52.544 --> 24:53.943
Maybe.

24:53.945 --> 24:55.278
Oh! Ow.

24:57.877 --> 24:59.878
Well, sometimes that's a good
thing for a girl like you.

25:04.578 --> 25:08.010
You seem very sure of what I
should and shouldn't be doing.

25:18.243 --> 25:19.945
You're not from
around here, are you?

25:21.444 --> 25:22.746
No.

25:23.444 --> 25:25.342
I'm not.

25:25.344 --> 25:26.445
Neither am I.

25:28.545 --> 25:30.145
We're outsiders.

26:10.976 --> 26:12.044
Hey.

26:13.444 --> 26:14.846
Come in.

26:33.278 --> 26:34.812
The house is great.

26:51.578 --> 26:53.345
My neighbors are real sweet.

26:54.812 --> 26:56.879
There's a clubhouse.
You can play bridge.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.344
So I said,
"I can play 21."

27:02.478 --> 27:03.846
Yeah.

27:06.277 --> 27:08.044
They don't play 21.

27:09.578 --> 27:11.178
My neighbor, Cheryl,

27:12.010 --> 27:13.479
her husband's in E3.

27:16.410 --> 27:18.512
You know, I can give you
a ride any time you want.

27:20.411 --> 27:21.846
No, it's fine.

27:22.577 --> 27:24.746
The car will be fixed soon.

27:30.077 --> 27:31.312
You ready for the rodeo?

27:36.477 --> 27:38.177
I'm gonna be the queen.

27:40.545 --> 27:43.242
That other girl has never
even barrel-raced before.

27:43.244 --> 27:45.078
She's just a pageant girl.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.809
You know that guy, Lyle?

27:58.811 --> 28:00.412
Cowboy, he's been
hanging around the diner?

28:05.944 --> 28:07.345
The one with
the wedding ring?

28:09.010 --> 28:10.941
I don't think he's married.

28:10.943 --> 28:13.211
Then why would he
be wearing a wedding ring?

28:14.143 --> 28:15.344
He asked me out.

28:16.343 --> 28:17.778
Sure he did.

28:19.077 --> 28:20.511
I'm sure you said yes.

28:22.277 --> 28:23.478
I might say yes.

28:25.378 --> 28:27.175
He wasn't wearing
a wedding ring.

28:27.177 --> 28:28.910
Don't say I didn't warn you.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.111
You wanna stay with me
when Taylor is away?

28:39.010 --> 28:41.045
No. Thank you.

28:44.110 --> 28:46.177
You know,
things are different now.

28:48.844 --> 28:50.045
What's different?

29:06.844 --> 29:08.312
What the fuck
is wrong, Jane?

29:16.243 --> 29:18.209
Don't you get tired

29:18.211 --> 29:22.074
of feeling totally
powerless sometimes?

29:22.076 --> 29:25.808
Every time a trucker or a loser just
looks at you and says something stupid

29:25.810 --> 29:28.010
and grabs your tits
and grabs your ass?

29:29.377 --> 29:31.442
You like that guy.

29:31.444 --> 29:35.075
He's fine and nice.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.211
You think he wants to take
you home for a soda, honey?

29:40.044 --> 29:41.811
I get it, Jane.

29:42.910 --> 29:45.212
But he's not that guy.

29:50.011 --> 29:51.178
Maybe.

29:52.810 --> 29:55.142
Maybe you are
just different.

29:55.144 --> 29:57.275
It's all different now.

29:57.277 --> 29:59.811
Maybe you and I have
always been different.

30:01.143 --> 30:02.511
We always have been.

30:04.411 --> 30:06.209
But we need each other.

30:06.211 --> 30:07.945
I don't need you
anymore, Heidi.

31:15.843 --> 31:18.208
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:18.210 --> 31:20.512
<i>welcome to
the Desert Rolling Rodeo.</i>

31:24.076 --> 31:25.341
You look beautiful.

31:25.343 --> 31:26.508
Thank you.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.010
Come here.
I want to show you something.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.475
You want some?

31:45.477 --> 31:48.408
Oh, no. I already had a beer
before you got here.

31:48.410 --> 31:50.342
I only allow myself one.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.077
So you really a cowboy?

31:54.577 --> 31:57.075
I grew up with horses.

31:57.077 --> 31:58.911
Recently, I'm learning
how to rope.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.845
You mean like a hobby?

32:02.943 --> 32:04.441
Yeah.

32:04.443 --> 32:06.009
Are you rich?

32:06.011 --> 32:07.278
No.

32:08.876 --> 32:11.176
Uh... I mean, I do fine.

32:11.178 --> 32:13.312
Okay, you're right.
I'm not a cowboy.

32:14.311 --> 32:15.911
So what do you do
for a job?

32:17.011 --> 32:18.745
I'm out here
setting up a center.

32:19.244 --> 32:20.511
What sort of center?

32:22.277 --> 32:25.178
Uh, customs, immigration,
border control.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.941
Uh, we set up
little villages for people

32:29.943 --> 32:33.109
while they're waiting to have
their deportation cases heard.

32:33.111 --> 32:36.111
Oh, so, like the government?

32:38.344 --> 32:41.841
You setting up one of those
holding pens for Mexicans?

32:41.843 --> 32:44.344
All right, if you wanna call it that, fine.
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

32:46.911 --> 32:49.042
All right, I get the politics,

32:49.044 --> 32:51.411
but you can't have people
just come in here illegally.

32:52.477 --> 32:54.145
It has to be organized.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.112
Are you...
Aren't you Mexican?

33:05.511 --> 33:07.178
What does that
have to do with anything?

33:09.178 --> 33:10.878
Why do you do that job?

33:14.011 --> 33:15.778
I deal with everybody.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.412
Just like you.

33:40.076 --> 33:42.841
<i>Oh, glorious,
the stars and stripes.</i>

33:42.843 --> 33:44.874
<i>The red, white and blue.</i>

33:44.876 --> 33:46.975
<i>This gal has been around
a lot of years</i>

33:46.977 --> 33:48.941
<i>and she's seen a lot</i>

33:48.943 --> 33:50.541
<i>and she has endured a lot.</i>

33:50.543 --> 33:52.974
<i>If she was able to speak
she'd say,</i>

33:52.976 --> 33:58.109
<i>"The red in my fabric stands for
the self-sacrificing courage.</i>

33:58.111 --> 34:02.108
<i>"The white stands for
liberty and justice.</i>

34:02.110 --> 34:06.008
<i>"And the blue,
the blue of heaven</i>

34:06.010 --> 34:09.242
<i>"stands for loyalty and faith."</i>

34:09.244 --> 34:10.945
<i>We may love our country,</i>

34:12.476 --> 34:15.541
<i>but we want something
better for ourselves.</i>

34:15.543 --> 34:18.311
<i>She stands tall
in her boots</i>

34:18.810 --> 34:20.909
<i>to bring strength</i>

34:22.543 --> 34:24.842
<i>and pride.</i>

34:24.844 --> 34:28.245
<i>For those who struggle with
the reality we're living in...</i>

34:28.976 --> 34:31.074
<i>Who thinks</i>

34:31.077 --> 34:33.208
<i>they were born
for more than this?</i>

34:33.210 --> 34:36.475
<i>Who believes the American
Dream has been twisted?</i>

34:36.476 --> 34:39.777
<i>The American Dream
has been taken away from us.</i>

34:42.143 --> 34:44.945
The American Dream
has been taken away from me.

34:47.976 --> 34:49.744
The past is poison.

34:58.278 --> 34:59.511
Congratulations.

35:00.442 --> 35:01.810
For what?

35:06.476 --> 35:09.010
It's a goddamn consolation
crown I didn't win.

35:12.577 --> 35:15.312
Doesn't matter.
They can all go to hell.

35:17.011 --> 35:18.178
I'm done.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.111
I want a real one.

35:22.310 --> 35:23.810
A real crown?

35:25.911 --> 35:26.978
Yeah.

35:28.011 --> 35:29.312
A real crown.

36:13.310 --> 36:15.811
Oh, what?

36:52.310 --> 36:53.941
Whoa!

36:53.943 --> 36:55.009
Whoa. Howdy there.

36:56.077 --> 36:57.212
What's that there for?

36:58.510 --> 37:00.945
It's there so I wouldn't
take off my shirt.

37:15.410 --> 37:16.443
Whoa.

37:17.577 --> 37:19.475
What happened to you?

37:19.477 --> 37:22.874
Oh, that's...
That's just there

37:22.876 --> 37:24.810
to keep me from
taking my shirt off.

37:29.543 --> 37:30.977
I had an operation.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.112
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

37:36.943 --> 37:38.575
Why?

37:38.577 --> 37:40.145
Well, they took out
my entire stomach.

37:40.943 --> 37:42.874
If you can believe that.

37:42.876 --> 37:44.343
- Your whole stomach?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:49.342 --> 37:51.475
What happened?

37:52.111 --> 37:53.877
I collapsed in the shower.

37:55.977 --> 37:57.542
And when they
took me to the hospital,

37:57.544 --> 37:59.277
the doctors said, "Well,

38:00.910 --> 38:02.243
"you're gonna die.

38:04.377 --> 38:07.009
"You have a huge tumor.

38:07.011 --> 38:09.145
"I mean, we could try something
but even that's a risk."

38:10.844 --> 38:12.244
Damn. I'm sorry.

38:14.442 --> 38:15.944
So I didn't die...

38:17.843 --> 38:19.376
But I'm like an old car.

38:20.843 --> 38:22.376
They just
pieced me back together.

38:24.343 --> 38:26.511
And I gotta go back
to the shop all the time.

38:29.477 --> 38:31.112
And that means...

38:32.911 --> 38:35.911
I have got to chew my food!

39:57.944 --> 39:59.177
Do you think she's okay?

39:59.876 --> 40:02.143
That girl?
She'll be fine.

40:07.276 --> 40:08.277
Mmm.

40:24.409 --> 40:25.841
<i>Hey, it's Jane.</i>

40:25.843 --> 40:28.911
<i>I can't pick up the phone,
so leave a message after the tone.</i>

40:31.176 --> 40:34.143
<i>Hey, Jane.
Give me a call.</i>

40:35.409 --> 40:37.176
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

40:43.843 --> 40:45.110
Jane.

41:12.209 --> 41:13.444
Jane?

41:57.376 --> 41:59.142
<i>Weren't you friends?</i>

41:59.144 --> 42:02.110
<i>Not really. She didn't seem like
she wanted to be friends with the wives.</i>

42:03.876 --> 42:06.407
So you don't think
she's been home, or...

42:06.409 --> 42:09.040
I don't know.
I saw her taking the bus last week.

42:09.042 --> 42:09.909
What bus?

42:09.911 --> 42:11.340
I know, right?
There ain't really a bus.

42:11.342 --> 42:12.941
You have to flag down
a Greyhound.

42:12.943 --> 42:14.744
Who does that?
We have cars.

42:15.876 --> 42:17.407
Where do you think
she was going?

42:17.409 --> 42:18.477
Beats me.

42:22.243 --> 42:23.908
<i>How's it going? This is Taylor.</i>

42:23.910 --> 42:25.274
<i>Sorry I couldn't get
to the phone right now.</i>

42:25.276 --> 42:27.110
<i>Leave your name,
I'll give you a call back.</i>

42:27.976 --> 42:29.310
<i>Hi, Taylor. It's Heidi.</i>

42:30.910 --> 42:32.443
I'm at your house.

42:33.342 --> 42:34.943
Can't get hold of Jane.

42:35.844 --> 42:36.844
Give me a call.

42:38.109 --> 42:40.074
<i>McKane Auto Repair.</i>

42:40.076 --> 42:43.073
Hi. Did Jane...

42:43.075 --> 42:46.108
Did she pick up
her car from you?

42:46.110 --> 42:48.477
<i>No, it's ready and all.
Are you gonna come get it?</i>

43:20.844 --> 43:23.241
<i>Heidi, where are you?
Where do you want to meet?</i>

43:23.243 --> 43:25.074
<i>Let's meet
at the casino.</i>

43:25.076 --> 43:28.140
<i>I want to see
if anyone's seen Jane.</i>

43:28.142 --> 43:31.041
<i>Don't worry about her.
That girl was cruel to you.</i>

43:31.043 --> 43:33.208
<i>She doesn't mean it.</i>

43:33.210 --> 43:35.073
<i>I'll get us a room.
I miss you.</i>

43:35.075 --> 43:36.410
<i>I'll see you there.</i>

43:45.310 --> 43:47.877
Uh, I am going to stay.

43:48.477 --> 43:49.944
- Hey!
- Hey.

43:51.242 --> 43:52.507
Hey.

43:52.509 --> 43:54.408
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

43:54.410 --> 43:56.009
I'm great.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.874
- What?
- Are you okay?

43:58.876 --> 44:00.177
Yeah, I am. Great. Why?

44:01.509 --> 44:04.140
This is Cherry.
Cherry, Heidi, Cherry, Heidi.

44:04.142 --> 44:05.444
We met before.

44:08.142 --> 44:09.809
Didn't you say
you're not supposed to drink?

44:09.811 --> 44:11.842
I'm gonna get you
what you want,

44:11.844 --> 44:14.808
which is a beer and not one
of these cherry whatevers.

44:14.810 --> 44:16.041
I'll be right back.

44:16.043 --> 44:18.474
I'm gonna take my money.
I'm gonna take my money.

44:18.476 --> 44:19.976
- Oh, shit.
- Whoa.

44:29.811 --> 44:33.008
Have you seen Jane?
Has she been here?

44:33.010 --> 44:34.244
You mean since she quit?

44:36.409 --> 44:37.443
Yeah.

44:38.309 --> 44:39.909
Maybe she's on vacation.

44:41.310 --> 44:43.010
She's not on vacation.

44:46.176 --> 44:47.877
Why do you
care about her so much?

44:50.142 --> 44:52.807
Don't you have
somebody you care about?

44:52.809 --> 44:55.076
Somebody you love?
A friend?

45:07.277 --> 45:10.475
Hey, where do you get
that green cactus stuff?

45:10.477 --> 45:13.307
Why? You want some?

45:13.309 --> 45:15.777
There's two types of people
in this universe.

45:16.943 --> 45:18.478
You're one kind,

45:19.410 --> 45:21.341
he's the other.

45:21.343 --> 45:23.841
I know you, Heidi.

45:23.843 --> 45:26.277
You'd break yourself
backwards for someone else.

45:27.143 --> 45:28.444
For Jane.

45:29.342 --> 45:30.744
And he...

45:32.210 --> 45:34.375
He'll always be okay.

45:34.377 --> 45:36.175
'Cause he looks out
for himself.

45:36.177 --> 45:38.208
You are so fucking wrong.

45:38.210 --> 45:40.274
I'd do anything for her.

45:40.276 --> 45:41.910
Come on,
let's get out of here.

45:42.942 --> 45:44.443
Thanks for the play.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.211
Thanks for the tip.

45:50.876 --> 45:52.143
Take care, Heidi.

46:00.443 --> 46:01.910
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

46:03.342 --> 46:05.474
- Hey, what are you doing? Stop it.
- This is Jane's.

46:05.476 --> 46:07.510
- Did she give it to you?
- Cherry made it for me.

46:14.875 --> 46:15.976
Hey.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.574
Shall we go up to the room?

46:19.576 --> 46:20.940
What's the room number?

46:23.876 --> 46:25.411
Okay.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.776
Oh, my God.

46:40.942 --> 46:42.144
Come on.

46:49.443 --> 46:50.743
Oof.

47:09.142 --> 47:10.310
Fuck.

47:54.376 --> 47:57.009
Does your wife know
what you're doing right now?

47:59.342 --> 48:01.009
The things you say to me?

48:04.109 --> 48:05.244
No.

48:11.976 --> 48:13.177
But it's not...

48:19.409 --> 48:20.844
We're friends.

48:32.942 --> 48:34.343
When I was sick...

48:37.543 --> 48:40.211
She stopped looking at me
like I was a man.

48:42.544 --> 48:43.877
And you...

48:49.010 --> 48:50.277
You look at me like...

48:52.576 --> 48:54.010
What I am.

48:57.076 --> 48:58.377
Or what I used to be.

49:25.875 --> 49:27.475
I could help you, you know.

49:27.477 --> 49:29.143
I can help you
get set up somewhere.

49:31.843 --> 49:34.044
I don't need to be
set up anywhere.

49:37.309 --> 49:39.973
People take advantage
of girls like you.

49:39.975 --> 49:42.909
You don't have family,
you don't have money.

49:45.543 --> 49:47.177
And they end up doing things.

49:49.143 --> 49:51.541
No, I've seen it. I know
what I'm talking about.

49:51.543 --> 49:53.377
Come on.

50:14.209 --> 50:15.310
Bye.

51:21.376 --> 51:22.843
Hey.

51:23.809 --> 51:25.111
Where's Butterscotch?

51:26.110 --> 51:27.311
What?

51:32.176 --> 51:33.776
The horse that's
usually here.

51:38.042 --> 51:39.176
I don't know.

51:52.976 --> 51:54.977
I'll pay you if you tell me
what I want to know.

51:56.342 --> 51:57.777
Yeah? How much?

52:03.441 --> 52:04.877
Hundred dollars.

52:12.009 --> 52:14.476
Somebody took off with him
about a week or so ago.

52:15.408 --> 52:17.876
Who took off with him?

52:19.010 --> 52:21.310
Some guys that
work for the boss.

52:22.442 --> 52:23.510
Who's your boss?

52:25.843 --> 52:28.073
I don't know his name,
I just call him "Boss."

52:28.075 --> 52:31.509
He just comes, he finds me,
and he gives me jobs sometimes.

52:33.408 --> 52:35.207
Where can I find him?

52:35.209 --> 52:38.843
Um, some of the guys say
he lives up near the mines.

52:41.209 --> 52:43.941
- Which mines?
- Gypsum mines.

52:43.943 --> 52:46.510
He's a big guy
and talks kind of funny.

52:55.476 --> 52:58.777
Did you ever hear of some rich guy
who lives out near Gypsum Mines?

52:59.809 --> 53:01.076
No.

53:04.043 --> 53:05.277
Big guy?

53:06.543 --> 53:08.309
Fat or tall?

53:10.441 --> 53:11.843
I don't know.

53:14.243 --> 53:19.007
There are all kinds of weirdos,
stay out there,

53:19.009 --> 53:21.241
sleeping in the caves.

53:21.243 --> 53:23.410
Protecting their land.

53:28.109 --> 53:30.040
She's about 5'7",

53:30.042 --> 53:32.843
and she has
long, brown hair.

53:35.308 --> 53:38.240
She lives up at
the base in Fort America,

53:38.242 --> 53:41.044
but she's not there, and...

53:42.810 --> 53:45.473
Her back door was open.

53:45.475 --> 53:50.275
And her neighbor says that
she hasn't been there in days.

53:52.276 --> 53:54.374
I can't get a hold
of her husband.

53:58.542 --> 54:00.309
She's not a kid.

54:03.376 --> 54:05.343
She's not a runaway,
no, she's...

54:06.809 --> 54:08.243
She's missing.

54:11.010 --> 54:12.276
Mrs. Ruiz.

54:14.508 --> 54:16.074
Mrs. Ruiz.

54:16.076 --> 54:17.242
Hi.

54:19.076 --> 54:20.342
What's your name again?

54:21.575 --> 54:23.473
Heidi.

54:23.475 --> 54:25.076
Like the cartoon.

54:27.475 --> 54:29.110
Have you heard from Jane?

54:29.942 --> 54:31.273
Why would I?

54:31.275 --> 54:33.207
Little switch got
everything she wanted.

54:33.209 --> 54:35.077
She's not even showing up
for church anymore.

54:36.076 --> 54:38.973
They said it's better

54:38.975 --> 54:41.509
if a family member
fills out the report.

54:41.876 --> 54:43.275
What report?

54:44.476 --> 54:46.340
A missing person's report.

54:46.342 --> 54:48.111
"Missing person's report"?

54:50.042 --> 54:51.409
Are you a crazy girl?

54:52.376 --> 54:54.274
I don't need any cops around.

54:54.276 --> 54:55.809
Jane ain't missing.

55:22.142 --> 55:24.809
Hey, Heidi.
There's a phone call for you.

55:25.843 --> 55:27.877
- Who is it?
- Some woman.

55:34.408 --> 55:35.974
Jane?

55:35.976 --> 55:38.541
<i>Heidi? It's Marina.</i>

55:38.543 --> 55:41.077
- <i>Your aunt. Lily's sister.</i>
- My fa...

55:45.075 --> 55:46.376
Hi, Marina.

55:47.442 --> 55:49.010
<i>Did you get my letter?</i>

55:50.341 --> 55:51.840
Yeah, I did.

55:51.842 --> 55:53.809
<i>Well, that's great.</i>

55:55.175 --> 55:56.810
- <i>How are you?</i>
- I'm okay.

56:00.010 --> 56:01.306
Hello?

56:01.308 --> 56:03.008
<i>Yeah. Hey, sweetie, I'm here.</i>

56:03.010 --> 56:05.041
<i>So are you gonna
come visit?</i>

56:05.043 --> 56:07.409
<i>I'd love to see what
a child of Lily's looks like.</i>

56:45.976 --> 56:47.310
My friend's gone missing.

56:50.109 --> 56:51.276
What do I do?

56:55.042 --> 56:56.909
How do you know
she didn't just wander off?

56:57.508 --> 56:59.573
Well, she left her car.

56:59.575 --> 57:01.209
Her house, all her things.

57:03.176 --> 57:05.777
- She wouldn't just leave.
- Well...

57:08.308 --> 57:09.777
What did you do first

57:11.409 --> 57:13.175
when Sarah went missing?

57:15.242 --> 57:18.110
I didn't realize Sarah was
gone until it was too late.

57:19.942 --> 57:21.276
But you're still looking.

57:23.810 --> 57:25.243
I'm searching for her bones.

57:28.975 --> 57:30.306
When the posters
first went up,

57:30.308 --> 57:33.106
some guy called who said,

57:33.108 --> 57:36.809
we'd find her a few miles north of
here, where the railroad used to run.

57:39.475 --> 57:42.744
Someone else called and said
we'd find her down a mine.

57:45.976 --> 57:48.010
We found some clothes
that might've been hers.

57:49.476 --> 57:51.807
Heat of the day,

57:51.809 --> 57:54.342
it's cool in the nights.
Destroys anything that could be helpful.

57:57.209 --> 57:58.744
Then there's the gossip.

58:00.376 --> 58:02.276
Someone said they
saw her on a bridge.

58:09.275 --> 58:11.209
I stopped listening
a long time ago.

58:15.408 --> 58:17.442
There is only one way
she could've died.

58:18.943 --> 58:20.510
One place she could be buried.

58:25.342 --> 58:28.410
The desert,
it'll swallow you up.

58:52.208 --> 58:53.242
Stop it.

58:54.141 --> 58:55.175
Shut up.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.375
You're a nightmare.

59:12.409 --> 59:13.976
Hold the food.

01:04:02.808 --> 01:04:04.307
Well, we don't
give out information.

01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:05.809
See, that's our whole deal.

01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:09.175
I know
she bought a gun here.

01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:12.776
People have a right
to their own privacy.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:15.474
- That's stupid.
- It's not stupid.

01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:18.440
It's the Fourth Amendment
to the Constitution.

01:04:18.442 --> 01:04:20.939
Now, maybe your friend
deserves her privacy.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:24.173
Maybe she's trying to protect
herself from somebody.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:28.006
That's why people buy guns.

01:04:28.008 --> 01:04:31.143
This is someone
who didn't need a gun.

01:04:32.809 --> 01:04:35.809
Who, as far as I know,

01:04:37.142 --> 01:04:39.742
wasn't in danger
from anybody but herself.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.943
Show me your hand.

01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:45.107
It's all right.
I'm not gonna bite you.

01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:46.875
Show me your hand.
Right there.

01:04:48.475 --> 01:04:51.375
Mmm. You've been
having dreams.

01:04:54.442 --> 01:04:55.909
You are in trouble.

01:04:58.175 --> 01:05:00.942
You best stop looking for your friend.
She's the trouble.

01:05:02.476 --> 01:05:03.774
Where is she?

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:06.843
The more you look for her,
the worse your dreams will get.

01:05:08.575 --> 01:05:11.340
I remember her.
Oh, yeah.

01:05:11.342 --> 01:05:14.176
Heading for Clay City,
said she's gonna set the world on fire.

01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:19.243
Jane's always saying
things like that.

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.972
Well, I've got a .38 special.

01:05:24.974 --> 01:05:26.006
Thank you.

01:05:26.008 --> 01:05:29.076
Fit that pretty little hand
just like a glove.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:36.343
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.475
Hey.

01:07:40.341 --> 01:07:41.475
How are you?

01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:44.243
- Good.
- Yeah?

01:07:49.408 --> 01:07:52.143
That is Jane's, isn't it?

01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:57.143
No. We all made them
for each other.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:02.375
Everybody. We all
made them for each other.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:07.908
Is she alive?

01:08:11.974 --> 01:08:13.842
She's in a better place.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:22.808
You okay?

01:08:28.073 --> 01:08:30.109
I got something
that'll help you find Jane.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:32.009
No.

01:08:34.508 --> 01:08:36.406
- You'll love it. Just try it.
- Can you tell me what...

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:37.506
What happened to her?

01:08:37.508 --> 01:08:39.175
I won't tell you what happened,
you'll just know.

01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:44.008
You'll just know.
Come on.

01:08:59.809 --> 01:09:01.109
Take me with you.

01:09:42.075 --> 01:09:43.341
We're home.

01:09:59.307 --> 01:10:00.475
That's Ren.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.775
You'll meet him.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.076
<i>Jane's here.</i>

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:14.475
<i>I can feel her.</i>

01:10:16.276 --> 01:10:18.842
<i>It makes you know things
without being told.</i>

01:10:21.307 --> 01:10:22.975
<i>It makes you
know the truth.</i>

01:10:41.809 --> 01:10:43.009
This place,

01:10:44.275 --> 01:10:45.809
the infusion.

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:50.873
It makes your dreams feel just
like they're real, like they're

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:52.409
happening right
in front of your eyes.

01:10:54.507 --> 01:10:56.776
Ren says it helps you
deal with your traumas.

01:11:09.808 --> 01:11:12.142
I had a dream like this.

01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:16.342
I keep having this dream.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.809
In the dream, I died.

01:11:25.941 --> 01:11:27.875
I'm at a motel...

01:11:28.941 --> 01:11:31.373
It's different.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:35.209
Staying in this room with a
balcony overlooking water.

01:11:38.408 --> 01:11:41.143
I have a glass
of whiskey in my hand.

01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:47.309
Someone's behind me.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.109
I fall... No.

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:54.342
I'm pushed.

01:11:56.874 --> 01:11:58.442
My neck's twisted.

01:11:59.575 --> 01:12:01.076
I died.

01:12:02.441 --> 01:12:03.875
I die...

01:12:05.475 --> 01:12:07.943
Looking up
into their face.

01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:14.943
Who pushed you?

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:22.508
Jane?

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.876
I've been looking for you.

01:12:32.507 --> 01:12:33.843
Why?

01:12:37.008 --> 01:12:38.808
Because you're
my best friend.

01:12:43.575 --> 01:12:45.142
And I love you.

01:13:13.042 --> 01:13:14.309
Don't worry, honey.

01:13:16.042 --> 01:13:17.242
We're all friends here.

01:13:18.474 --> 01:13:20.842
Everyone is here
because they wanna be here.

01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:23.439
You've taken these people.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:25.943
- What?
- You've taken these people.

01:13:28.174 --> 01:13:29.942
You chose to come here.

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.241
You asked to come here,
didn't you?

01:13:34.842 --> 01:13:36.906
Heidi,

01:13:36.908 --> 01:13:38.942
there are two types
of people in this world.

01:13:40.308 --> 01:13:42.573
Those who are lost
and powerless,

01:13:42.575 --> 01:13:45.405
and those who have found
their place and their power.

01:13:45.407 --> 01:13:47.008
Which are you?

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.109
- I'm...
- You're lost, aren't you?

01:13:55.808 --> 01:13:58.174
<i>You've been rushing around
trying to please everyone.</i>

01:14:01.809 --> 01:14:03.475
<i>You don't have to
do that anymore.</i>

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.943
So you feel at home.

01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:25.108
<i>You can be
part of something.</i>

01:14:27.307 --> 01:14:29.008
<i>You can have power.</i>

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:35.875
<i>We're a family, Heidi.</i>

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.405
<i>If someone harms us,</i>

01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:40.808
<i>we deal with them.</i>

01:15:15.141 --> 01:15:16.808
- Close the door, lady.
- Hey.

01:15:18.073 --> 01:15:19.374
Get the hell outta here.

01:15:21.408 --> 01:15:23.008
You can stay, you know.

01:15:24.407 --> 01:15:25.942
If you want.

01:15:29.307 --> 01:15:30.809
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:15:33.808 --> 01:15:34.974
Do you want a family?

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:37.909
Yes, I do.

01:15:56.074 --> 01:15:57.441
I feel your pain.

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:01.241
You've been hurt.

01:16:05.808 --> 01:16:07.208
<i>Do you know how I know?</i>

01:16:09.842 --> 01:16:11.442
<i>I felt the same pain.</i>

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:16.074
That dark, hidden pain.

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:22.275
You didn't have
a real father, did you?

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.807
No.

01:16:24.809 --> 01:16:26.075
And your mother?

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:28.907
She died.

01:16:34.108 --> 01:16:35.975
<i>You don't know how
to receive love.</i>

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:42.241
<i>You don't recognize it.</i>

01:16:44.407 --> 01:16:46.309
<i>You don't know
how to fully give in.</i>

01:16:55.307 --> 01:16:57.142
<i>You're always knocking
on the wrong door.</i>

01:17:00.207 --> 01:17:02.441
<i>Because you've never
been shown the way.</i>

01:17:03.074 --> 01:17:05.242
<i>What is this stuff?</i>

01:17:06.441 --> 01:17:08.109
<i>It opens your heart.</i>

01:17:09.175 --> 01:17:10.442
And your mind.

01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:14.743
It makes your dreams
come true.

01:18:05.407 --> 01:18:06.908
You need to improve.

01:18:08.207 --> 01:18:09.308
I am.

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:12.838
I was talking to Ren.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.105
Talking about how you're not
living up to your full potential.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.006
Cherry, that's bullshit,
and you know it.

01:18:18.008 --> 01:18:21.007
- Okay, I've reaped more than anybody here.
- Like...

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.074
Let's give Heidi a go.

01:18:29.341 --> 01:18:31.075
What, you've never
shot a shotgun?

01:18:32.475 --> 01:18:33.975
I have.

01:18:49.208 --> 01:18:50.540
Nice.

01:18:50.542 --> 01:18:52.074
I just don't like them.

01:19:32.007 --> 01:19:33.475
Flower can't go into town.

01:19:34.575 --> 01:19:36.272
She has to be back here.

01:19:36.274 --> 01:19:37.508
Maybe you can do it.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.272
I'm just saying, I don't want to
go see Bobby. It should be a girl.

01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:44.305
Maybe Jane
should go.

01:19:44.307 --> 01:19:45.808
Jane, you can go.

01:19:48.008 --> 01:19:49.375
You good, Heidi?

01:19:53.507 --> 01:19:55.005
Mmm.

01:19:56.407 --> 01:19:58.007
I feel you.

01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:01.807
Yeah,
I definitely can go.

01:20:05.508 --> 01:20:08.275
I think she's come
the longest way so far.

01:20:15.508 --> 01:20:18.905
Honey's feeling stronger
than she ever has.

01:20:18.907 --> 01:20:21.473
I can feel
her strength growing.

01:20:21.475 --> 01:20:25.039
She's learning more
about herself and her body.

01:20:25.041 --> 01:20:26.442
Isn't that right, Honey?

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.741
Flower's commitment to her
family is stronger than ever.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.742
And we belong
to each other.

01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:37.042
How about Heidi?

01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:40.042
Is anyone feeling Heidi?

01:20:42.107 --> 01:20:43.274
Rainbow?

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:46.774
Heidi...

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.908
Heidi wants to be
part of our family.

01:20:53.874 --> 01:20:55.241
But she's scared

01:20:56.841 --> 01:20:58.409
and suspicious.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.941
She lives in the past.

01:21:02.509 --> 01:21:04.409
The past is poison.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.341
The past is poison.

01:21:09.307 --> 01:21:11.174
The past is poison.

01:21:14.374 --> 01:21:16.108
She's weak with fear.

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:22.275
We don't use
such negative words, Rainbow.

01:23:14.307 --> 01:23:16.106
Get the hell off me.

01:23:16.108 --> 01:23:17.942
Get off me, pervert!

01:23:23.307 --> 01:23:24.375
Don't touch me.

01:23:29.407 --> 01:23:31.572
Hey!

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:34.175
- Get the fuck back in here!
- Get off of me.

01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:47.241
Heidi.

01:23:58.541 --> 01:23:59.942
You're a diamond.

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:06.108
- I'm a diamond?
- You're a diamond.

01:24:17.175 --> 01:24:18.341
That's mine.

01:24:20.841 --> 01:24:23.142
We share everything,
Rainbow. You know that.

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.807
That trick doesn't
seem to work on me.

01:25:16.439 --> 01:25:18.308
- You can't.
- I can do whatever I want.

01:25:19.506 --> 01:25:21.142
I want to dance
on my own, Jane.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.041
We should go.

01:25:50.506 --> 01:25:51.941
I'm not leaving.

01:25:54.174 --> 01:25:55.309
Jane...

01:25:57.874 --> 01:26:00.437
How long have you even
known these people for?

01:26:00.439 --> 01:26:04.474
I need to take care of Butterscotch.

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.241
Jane, I'm not
leaving you here.

01:26:11.874 --> 01:26:14.042
I, Jane Briana Ruiz,

01:26:15.574 --> 01:26:17.475
deserve better
than what I got.

01:26:18.274 --> 01:26:20.108
You did fine.

01:26:21.873 --> 01:26:23.806
I didn't.

01:26:23.808 --> 01:26:26.875
You might as well have buried me
in that house in Fort America.

01:26:31.439 --> 01:26:33.872
Let me tell
you something, Heidi.

01:26:33.874 --> 01:26:35.441
I want you to understand.

01:26:38.174 --> 01:26:41.307
We don't have to take the bullshit
that is out there, we don't.

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:47.908
We don't have to be treated like
something that someone just steps on.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.504
I spent my whole life

01:26:53.506 --> 01:26:56.974
trying to smile at someone
for a casino chip.

01:26:59.573 --> 01:27:01.475
Fucking someone for dinner.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.571
Little humiliations.

01:27:07.573 --> 01:27:10.338
Little humiliations
here and there.

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.841
Men using me.

01:27:13.273 --> 01:27:15.472
People using me,
men using me.

01:27:15.474 --> 01:27:16.871
Telling me who I am.

01:27:16.873 --> 01:27:18.438
Jane, I get that, too.

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.775
No.

01:27:20.873 --> 01:27:22.108
It happens.

01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:25.340
Now I'm the boss.

01:27:27.339 --> 01:27:28.742
No, you're not.

01:27:29.474 --> 01:27:30.742
Ren is.

01:27:31.907 --> 01:27:34.338
All that stuff,

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.438
geez, it's still
happening to you.

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:41.538
He's shown us our own strength.
Do you want that, Heidi? Do you want that?

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.404
Don't you wanna feel that power?
Do you wanna feel it?

01:27:44.406 --> 01:27:48.138
That stuff, that drug makes
you think that you have power,

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.038
but it's a trick.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.407
It's not real.

01:27:52.207 --> 01:27:54.438
No.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.838
You've tried it.
You've tried it, you know it.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.906
It pulls you into everything,

01:27:58.908 --> 01:28:01.042
and it makes you
know everything.

01:28:03.274 --> 01:28:04.507
Yeah, you...

01:28:07.307 --> 01:28:08.475
You just...

01:28:10.073 --> 01:28:11.474
You just don't get it.

01:28:13.141 --> 01:28:15.872
And that's a shame
'cause Ren thought you did.

01:28:15.874 --> 01:28:18.504
Fuck that, Jane. Fuck that!

01:28:18.506 --> 01:28:20.271
- Come on.
- Leave me.

01:28:20.273 --> 01:28:22.172
This place is
fucking dangerous.

01:28:22.174 --> 01:28:24.138
It's fucking dangerous!

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.475
You're being used.

01:28:28.874 --> 01:28:31.742
Hey. If you come with me...

01:28:34.207 --> 01:28:36.539
I promise...
I promise you,

01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.805
we'll go to Cap'corn.

01:28:38.807 --> 01:28:41.108
Hey. You wanted
to be a star.

01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:44.139
We could do that.

01:28:44.141 --> 01:28:45.338
Come with me.

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.905
There's nothing for me there.

01:28:46.907 --> 01:28:48.507
- No, come on, just come with me.
- No.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.039
- Get off me.
- No, come on, Jane.

01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.775
- Let's go. Let's...
- Get off me!

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:04.441
If you disappeared,

01:29:06.173 --> 01:29:07.875
no one would even notice.

01:29:10.973 --> 01:29:13.808
I was the only person who
noticed when you disappeared.

01:29:22.339 --> 01:29:24.173
You don't have
any power, Jane.

01:29:34.007 --> 01:29:35.108
Bye.

01:29:55.173 --> 01:29:56.308
Are you okay?

01:29:58.008 --> 01:29:59.107
Yeah.

01:30:00.306 --> 01:30:01.474
I'm fine.

01:30:02.041 --> 01:30:03.741
You wanna come with me?

01:30:05.373 --> 01:30:06.875
I'm good right here.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:09.308
Okay.

01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:51.208
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:31:53.439 --> 01:31:55.040
Do you know this woman?

01:31:57.407 --> 01:31:59.104
Was she famous?

01:31:59.106 --> 01:32:00.907
- Do you know her?
- Kind of.

01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:03.340
I knew her as Sarah.

01:32:04.406 --> 01:32:06.041
I don't remember her.

01:32:07.473 --> 01:32:09.207
People just drop them off.

01:32:10.073 --> 01:32:11.872
We use them as wallpaper.

01:32:11.874 --> 01:32:14.041
If you're a fan, I mean,
you can have it.

01:32:14.474 --> 01:32:16.105
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:32:16.107 --> 01:32:18.171
Go ahead, take it off.

01:32:18.173 --> 01:32:19.507
We'll put another one up.

01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:22.304
What's her name again?

01:32:22.306 --> 01:32:23.507
<i>Sarah Fields.</i>

01:32:53.007 --> 01:32:56.006
Hi. I'm...
I'm looking for Marina.

01:32:59.973 --> 01:33:01.241
Oh, my God.

01:33:02.039 --> 01:33:03.273
You're Heidi.

01:33:04.139 --> 01:33:06.104
- Marina?
- Yes.

01:33:06.106 --> 01:33:08.207
Well, come here,
let me hug you.

01:33:13.973 --> 01:33:15.241
Lily's daughter.

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.475
You're so gorgeous.

01:33:27.374 --> 01:33:29.171
If you know restaurants,

01:33:29.173 --> 01:33:30.940
you can do something
with this place.

01:33:32.007 --> 01:33:33.775
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:33:35.439 --> 01:33:37.141
Well, I don't know
who'd eat there.

01:33:38.106 --> 01:33:39.273
I would.

01:33:44.107 --> 01:33:46.308
How did you end up
in that place in the desert?

01:33:48.573 --> 01:33:51.006
I went there with a boy, and...

01:33:52.474 --> 01:33:55.208
Once we got there,
he wasn't so good.

01:33:58.474 --> 01:34:00.241
Well, I'll tell you
what I've learned.

01:34:01.039 --> 01:34:03.107
'Cause I know this well.

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:08.172
Hurtful acts are the
transference to others

01:34:08.174 --> 01:34:10.241
of the degradation that
we bear in ourselves.

01:34:12.573 --> 01:34:14.807
He only hurt you
because he was hurting.

01:34:16.973 --> 01:34:18.308
Are you religious?

01:34:19.373 --> 01:34:21.070
Not really...

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.440
But yes, yeah...

01:34:23.173 --> 01:34:24.373
I am.

01:34:25.072 --> 01:34:26.440
I'm waiting.

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:33.308
I mean, the only thing
that I really know about God

01:34:34.006 --> 01:34:36.974
is that he is
what we are not.

01:34:39.339 --> 01:34:43.137
And every sin
is an attempt

01:34:43.139 --> 01:34:44.973
to fly from emptiness.

01:34:47.072 --> 01:34:48.373
Something like that.
