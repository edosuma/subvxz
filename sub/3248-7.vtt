WEBVTT

00:08.960 --> 00:11.997
Oh, smell that air.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.436
Grass and lemonade
and a little bit of mint.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.954
Just a hint of mint,
it must be the 1920's.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.077
You can tell what year it is,
just by smelling?

00:21.160 --> 00:22.229
Oh, yeah.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.108
Or maybe that big vintage car,
coming up the drive, gave it away.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.236
The professor's luggage,
Richard, step lively.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.998
- Good afternoon, Professor Peach.
- Hello, Greeves, old man.

00:42.200 --> 00:45.795
- Ah, Reverend.
- Professor Peach. Beautiful day.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.836
Lord's in his heaven,
all's right with the world.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.592
Reverend Golightly.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.195
Lady Eddison requests that you make
yourselves comfortable in your rooms.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.352
Cocktails will be served on the lawn
from half past four.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.829
You go on up. I need to check
something in the library.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.148
- Oh?
- Alone.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.471
It's supposed to be a party.
All this work'll be the death of you.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.680
Never mind planet Zog! A party
in the 1920's, that's more like it.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.399
Trouble is, we haven't been invited.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.948
Oh, I forgot. Yes, we have.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.832
I was right.

01:18.920 --> 01:23.232
Kept secret all these years.
It's unbelievable.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.799
But why didn't they ask... Heavens.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.392
Oh, it's you.
I was just doing a little research.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.869
I say, what are you
doing with that lead piping?

01:35.120 --> 01:36.553
That's impossible.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.993
No! No!

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.280 --> 02:18.510
We'll be late for cocktails.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.875
What do you think, flapper or slapper?

02:25.320 --> 02:27.356
Flapper. You look lovely.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.631
Look sharp. We have guests.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.514
- Good afternoon.
- Drinks, sir, ma'am?

02:42.600 --> 02:45.672
- A sidecar, please.
- And a lime soda. Thank you.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.399
May I announce Lady Clemency Eddison.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.357
Lady Eddison.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.750
Forgive me,
but who exactly might you be?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.354
- And what are you doing here?
- I'm the Doctor

02:56.440 --> 02:59.750
and this is Miss Donna Noble,
of the Chiswick Nobles.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.516
Good afternoon, my lady.
Topping day, what? Spiffing. Top hole.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.558
No, no, no, no, no.
No, don't do that. Don't.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.870
We were thrilled to receive
your invitation, milady.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.669
- We met at the Ambassador's reception.
- Doctor, how could I forget you?

03:13.760 --> 03:16.911
But one must be sure
with the Unicorn on the loose.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.036
A unicorn? Brilliant. Where?

03:19.120 --> 03:23.716
The Unicorn. Ajewel thief
and nobody knows who he is.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.472
He's just struck again.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.109
Snatched Lady Babington's pearls
right from under her nose.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.031
- Funny place to wear pearls.
- May I announce

03:31.120 --> 03:34.999
the Colonel Hugh Curbishley,
the Honourable Roger Curbishley.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.390
My husband and my son.

03:38.480 --> 03:39.993
Forgive me for not rising.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.470
Never been the same ever since
that 'flu epidemic back in '18.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.757
My word. You are a super lady.

03:46.840 --> 03:50.230
Oh, I like the colour of your jib.
Chin-chin.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.992
- Hello, I'm the Doctor.
- How do you do?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.594
- Very well.
- Your usual, sir?

03:54.680 --> 03:57.035
Thank you, Davenport.
Just how I like it.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.396
How come she's an Eddison,
but her husband and son are Curbishleys?

04:00.480 --> 04:05.429
The Eddison title descends through her.
One day, Roger will be a Lord.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.919
Robina Redmond.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.879
She's the absolute hit
of the social scene, a must.

04:10.960 --> 04:14.999
- Miss Redmond.
- Spiffing to meet you at last, milady.

04:15.080 --> 04:20.757
- Reverend Arnold Golightly.
- Ah, Reverend. How are you?

04:20.839 --> 04:23.718
I heard about the church
last Thursday night.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.792
- Those ruffians breaking in.
- You apprehended them, I hear.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.793
As the Christian fathers taught me,
we must forgive them their trespasses,

04:30.880 --> 04:31.915
quite literally.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.673
Some of these young boys
deserve a decent thrashing.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.829
Couldn't agree more, sir.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.998
Typical.
All the decent men are on the other bus.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.308
- Or Time Lords.
Now, milady,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.470
what about the special guest
you promised us?

04:43.560 --> 04:48.793
Here she is.
A lady who needs no introduction.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.950
No, no, please don't.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.191
Thank you, Lady Eddison,
but, honestly, there is no need.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.840
- Agatha Christie.
- What about her?

04:56.920 --> 05:01.436
- That's me.
- No. You're kidding.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.159
Agatha Christie. I was just talking
about you the other day.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.356
I said, "I bet she's brilliant".
I'm the Doctor, this is Donna.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.318
Oh! I love your stuff. What a mind.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.789
You fool me every time.
Well, almost every time.

05:11.880 --> 05:17.113
Well, once or twice. Well, once.
But it was a good once.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.792
You make a rather unusual couple.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.279
- Oh, no, we're not married.
- No, we're not a couple.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.954
Well, obviously not. No wedding ring.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.111
- Oh. You don't miss a trick.
- And I'd stay that way, if I were you.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.431
The thrill is in the chase,
never in the capture.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.273
Mrs Christie,
I'm so glad you could come.

05:33.360 --> 05:38.195
I'm one of your greatest followers.
I've read all six of your books.

05:38.280 --> 05:43.195
- Is Mr Christie not joining us?
- Is he needed?

05:43.280 --> 05:45.396
Can't a woman
make her own way in the world?

05:45.480 --> 05:46.993
Don't give my wife ideas.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.832
Now, Mrs Christie, I have a question.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.150
- Why a Belgian detective?
- Excuse me, Colonel.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.549
Belgians make such lovely buns.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.390
Say, where on Earth's Professor Peach?
He'd love to meet Mrs Christie.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.550
He said he was going to the library.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.797
Miss Chandrakala, would you go
and collect the Professor?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.998
- At once, milady.
- The date on this newspaper...

06:11.080 --> 06:12.752
What about it?

06:12.840 --> 06:16.071
It's the day
Agatha Christie disappeared.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.113
Professor Peach?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.435
Professor?

06:29.720 --> 06:33.269
She just discovered
her husband was having an affair.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.828
You'd never think to look at her,
smiling away.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.755
Well. She's British, moneyed.
That's what they do. They carry on.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.631
Except for this one time.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.950
No one knows exactly what happened,
she just vanished.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.877
Her car will be found tomorrow morning,
by the side of a lake.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.396
Ten days later, Agatha Christie turns up
at a hotel in Harrogate.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.755
And she'd lost her memory.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.832
She never spoke about the disappearance
till the day she died.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.151
- But whatever it was...
- It's about to happen.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.310
Right here, right now.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.029
Professor! The library! Murder! Murder!

07:18.800 --> 07:20.756
Goodness.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.990
Bashed on the head. Blunt instrument.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.270
Watch broke as he fell.
Time of death was quarter past four.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.713
A bit of pipe.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.313
Call me Hercule Poirot,
but I reckon that's blunt enough.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.629
Nothing worth killing for in that lot.
Dry as dust.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.878
Doctor, the body in the library.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.953
I mean, Professor Peach, in the library,
with a lead piping.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.393
Let me see.
Out of my way.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.549
Gerald.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.236
- Someone should call the police.
You don't have to.

07:54.320 --> 07:56.754
Chief Inspector Smith,
from Scotland Yard, known as the Doctor.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.910
Miss Noble is the plucky young girl
who helps me out.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.513
- I say.
- Mrs Christie was right.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.160
Go into the sitting room.
I will question each of you in turn.

08:03.240 --> 08:07.392
Come along, do as the Doctor says.
Keep the room undisturbed.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.471
"The plucky young girl
who helps me out?"

08:09.560 --> 08:11.630
No policewomen in 1926.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.359
I'll pluck you in a minute.
Why don't we phone the real police?

08:14.440 --> 08:17.671
Oh, the last thing we want
is PC Plod sticking his nose in.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.469
Especially, now I've found this.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.115
- Morphic residue.
- Morphic? Doesn't sound very 1926.

08:26.200 --> 08:30.113
It has left behind
a return species' genetic immune code.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.838
The murderer's an alien.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.070
Which means one of that lot
is a alien in human form.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.832
Yeah, but think about it.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.356
There's a murder,
a mystery and Agatha Christie.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.953
So? Happens to me all the time.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.634
No. But isn't that a bit weird?

08:44.720 --> 08:49.032
Agatha Christie didn't go around
surrounded by murders, not really.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.838
I mean, that's like
meeting Charles Dickens

08:50.920 --> 08:55.198
and he's surrounded by ghosts
at Christmas.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.759
- Well...
- Oh, come on.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.353
It's not like we could
drive across country

08:58.440 --> 09:01.273
and find Enid Blyton
having tea with Noddy.

09:01.360 --> 09:06.229
Could we? Noddy's not real. Is he?
Tell me there's no Noddy.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.398
There's no Noddy.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.674
Next thing you know,
you'll be telling me

09:09.760 --> 09:13.036
<i>it's like Murder on the Orient Express,
and they all did it.</i>

09:13.120 --> 09:16.908
<i>- Murder on the Orient Express?
- Oh, yeah, one of the best.</i>

09:17.000 --> 09:18.797
But not yet.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.950
- Marvellous idea, though.
- Yeah.

09:21.040 --> 09:24.271
Tell you what,
copyright, Donna Noble. Okay?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.193
Anyway, Agatha and I
will question the suspects.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.872
Donna, you search the bedrooms,
look for clues.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.918
Any more residues.
You'll need this.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.390
- Is that for real.
- Go on, you're ever so plucky.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.789
Right, then, solving a murder mystery
with Agatha Christie. Brilliant.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.792
How like a man to have fun
while there is disaster all around him.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.838
- Sorry, yeah.
- I'll work with you, gladly.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.310
But for the sake of justice,
not your own amusement.

09:55.240 --> 10:00.553
Now, then, Reverend,
where were you at a quarter past four?

10:00.640 --> 10:01.868
Let me think.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.117
Why, yes, I remember.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.468
<i>I was unpacking in my room.</i>

10:08.560 --> 10:11.518
<i>No alibi, then?
You were alone?</i>

10:12.000 --> 10:15.117
With the Lord
one is never truly alone.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.952
- Doctor?
- And where were you?

10:17.040 --> 10:18.712
Let me think, I was...

10:18.800 --> 10:22.713
Oh, yes, I was taking a constitutional
in the fields behind the house.

10:25.440 --> 10:28.591
<i>Just taking a stroll, that's all.</i>

10:28.680 --> 10:31.638
<i>Alone?
- Oh, yes. All alone, totally alone.</i>

10:31.720 --> 10:34.871
<i>Absolutely alone. Completely.
All of the time.</i>

10:34.960 --> 10:37.713
<i>I wandered lonely
as the proverbial cloud.</i>

10:37.800 --> 10:42.271
There was no one else with me.
Not at all. Not ever.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.716
- And, where were you?
- At a quarter past four?

10:45.800 --> 10:49.076
Well, I went to the toilet
when I arrived, and then...

10:51.920 --> 10:55.993
<i>Oh, yes, I remember.
I was preparing myself.</i>

10:56.080 --> 10:58.036
Positively buzzing with excitement
about the party

10:58.120 --> 11:00.395
and the super fun of meeting Lady Eddie.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.391
We've only got your word for it.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.119
That's your problem, not mine.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.838
And, where were you, sir?

11:06.920 --> 11:10.629
Quarter past four?
Dear me! Let me think.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.153
Ah, yes, I remember.

11:13.760 --> 11:18.197
<i>I was in me study,
reading through some military memoirs.</i>

11:18.280 --> 11:20.635
<i>Fascinating stuff.</i>

11:20.720 --> 11:26.033
<i>Took me back to me days in the army.
Started reminiscing.</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:29.715
<i>Mafeking... Terrible war.</i>

11:29.800 --> 11:31.438
<i>Colonel, snap out of it.</i>

11:34.040 --> 11:36.759
<i>- I was in me study.
- No, no, no, right out of it.</i>

11:36.840 --> 11:41.277
Oh, sorry. Got a bit carried away there.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.955
And where were you
at a quarter past four, milady?

11:45.040 --> 11:46.996
Now, let me see.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.671
<i>Yes, I remember.
I was sitting in the blue room,</i>

11:51.760 --> 11:55.594
<i>taking my afternoon tea.
It's a ritual of mine.</i>

11:55.680 --> 11:59.798
<i>I needed to gather strength
for the duty of hostess.</i>

11:59.880 --> 12:04.112
I then proceeded to the lawn,
where I met you, Doctor,

12:04.200 --> 12:09.194
and I said, "And who exactly might
you be and what were you doing here?"

12:09.280 --> 12:13.990
<i>And you said, "I am the Doctor
and this is Miss Donna Noble... "</i>

12:14.080 --> 12:17.117
Yes, yes, you can stop now.
I was there for that bit.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.269
Of course.

12:18.360 --> 12:21.511
Excuse me.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.352
No alibis for any of them.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.751
Secret adversary remains hidden.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.871
We must look for a motive.
Use the little, grey cells.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.272
Oh, yes. Little, grey cells.
Good ol' Poirot.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.989
You know, I've been to Belgium, yeah.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.229
I remember.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.548
<i>I was deep in the Ardennes,
trying to find Charlemagne.</i>

12:48.640 --> 12:51.154
<i>He'd been kidnapped
by an insane computer.</i>

12:51.240 --> 12:53.674
<i>Doctor! Doctor!</i>

12:53.760 --> 12:54.954
Sorry.

12:55.040 --> 12:59.079
- Charlemagne lived centuries ago.
- I've got a very good memory.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.720
For such an experience, Detective,
you missed a big clue.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.472
What, that bit of paper
you nicked out of the fire?

13:03.560 --> 13:04.788
- You were looking the other way.
- Yeah,

13:04.880 --> 13:08.077
but I saw you reflected
in the glass of the bookcase.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.235
You crafty man.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.198
This is all that was left.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.518
What's that first letter,
"N" or "M"?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.079
It's an "M".
The word is "maiden".

13:20.160 --> 13:22.390
Maiden! What does that mean?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.914
We're still no further forward.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.437
Our nemesis remains at large.
Unless Miss Noble's found something.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.790
You won't find anything.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.436
- How come it's locked?
- Lady Eddison commands it to be so.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.832
And I command it to be otherwise.
Scotland Yard. Pip, pip.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.715
Why was it locked in the first place?

13:55.800 --> 13:59.315
Many years ago,
when my father was butler to the family,

13:59.400 --> 14:02.278
Lady Eddison returned
from India with malaria.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.511
She locked herself in this room
for six months until she recovered.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.798
Since then,
the room has remained undisturbed.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.238
There's nothing in here.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.108
- How long has it been empty?
- Forty years.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.919
Why did she seal it off?

14:23.960 --> 14:27.999
All right, I need to investigate.
You just buttle off.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.676
1926, they've still got bees.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.752
Oh, what noise. All right, busy bee,
I'll let you out. Hold on.

14:57.800 --> 15:02.669
I shall find you
with my amazing powers of detection.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.192
It's impossible.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.269
Doctor!

15:26.840 --> 15:29.149
Doctor!

15:33.520 --> 15:36.478
There is a giant wasp.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.599
- What do you mean a giant wasp?
- I mean, a wasp that's giant.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.716
It's only a silly, little insect.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.553
When I say giant, I don't mean big.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.428
I mean flipping enormous!
Look at its sting.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.518
Let me see.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.789
It's gone. Buzzed off.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.478
But that's fascinating.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.678
Don't, don't...
Don't touch it, don't touch it. Let me.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.034
A giant wasp?

16:06.680 --> 16:09.831
Well, tons of amorphous,
insectivorous life forms,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.673
but none in this galactic vector.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.399
I think I understood
some of those words.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.550
Enough to know
that you're completely potty.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.596
Lost its sting.
Now, that makes it defenceless.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.114
A creature this size
got to be able to grow a new one.

16:22.200 --> 16:26.910
Uh, can we return to sanity?
There are no such things as giant wasps.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.312
Exactly, so...
Question is, what's it doing here?

16:33.920 --> 16:36.992
A murder? That's put the cat
among the pigeons and no mistake.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.834
It is not the stuff of gossip, Mrs Hart.
Continue with your work.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.070
But, who'd want to do in
the old Professor?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.390
He was always asking questions
about that book of his.

16:45.480 --> 16:49.189
- What was all that about?
- A dead man's folly, nothing more.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.314
Perhaps, if he asked about...

16:54.160 --> 16:56.196
I must go and see milady.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.358
The poor, little child.

17:24.599 --> 17:25.874
There!

17:28.119 --> 17:29.633
Come on!

17:29.720 --> 17:33.076
This makes a change.
There's a monster and we're chasing it.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.311
Every monster has a trick.
They do it with mirrors.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.028
Oh, my God, that's holy.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.953
Oh. Well, you are wonderful.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.838
Now, just stop. Stop there.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.994
Oi, fly boy.

18:01.320 --> 18:05.108
Don't let it get away! Quick,
before it reverts back to human form!

18:05.200 --> 18:09.432
Where are you? Come on.
There's nowhere to run. Show yourself.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.994
Oh.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.559
That's just cheating.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.392
My faithful companion. This is terrible.

18:21.480 --> 18:25.553
Excuse me, milady. She was on her way
to tell you something.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.312
She never found me.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.914
She had an appointment
with death instead.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.516
She said, "The poor, little child".
Does that mean anything to anyone?

18:34.600 --> 18:39.594
No children in this house for years.
Highly unlikely there will be any.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.430
Mrs Christie, you must have
twigged something.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.193
You've written simply
the best detective stories.

18:47.280 --> 18:50.352
Tell us, what would Poirot do?

18:50.440 --> 18:54.638
Heaven's sake, cards on the table,
woman. You should be helping us.

18:54.720 --> 19:00.192
- But... I'm merely a writer.
- But surely you can crack it.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.158
These events are exactly
like one your plots.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.357
That's what I've been saying.
Agatha, that's gotta mean something.

19:06.440 --> 19:11.309
But what? I've no answers, none.

19:11.640 --> 19:16.316
I'm sorry, all of you.
I'm truly sorry, but I've failed.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.312
If anyone can help us,
then it's the Doctor, not me.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.999
Do you know what I think?

19:30.080 --> 19:33.959
Those books of yours, one day,
they could turn them into films.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.589
- They could be talking pictures.
- Talking pictures?

19:37.680 --> 19:42.071
- Pictures that talk. What do you mean?
- Oh, blimey, I've done it again.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.714
I appreciate you're trying to be kind,
but you are right.

19:46.800 --> 19:51.316
These murders are like my own creations.
It's as though someone's mocking me.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.709
And I've had enough scorn
for one lifetime.

19:53.800 --> 19:58.510
Yeah. The thing is,
I had this bloke once.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.912
I was engaged and I loved him.
I really did.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.389
Turns out,
he was lying through his teeth.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.755
But you know what? I moved on.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.118
I was lucky. I found the Doctor.
He's changed my life.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.510
- There's always someone else.
- I see.

20:15.600 --> 20:19.991
- Is my marriage the stuff of gossip now?
- No, I just... I'm sorry.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.317
No matter, the stories are true.
I found my husband with another woman.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.794
A younger, prettier woman.
Isn't it always the way?

20:29.880 --> 20:35.000
Well, mine was with a giant spider,
but, same difference.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.878
You and the Doctor talk
such wonderful nonsense.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.077
Agatha, people love your books.
They really do.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.152
They're gonna be reading them
for years to come.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.596
If only. Try as I might,
it's hardly great literature.

20:47.680 --> 20:52.390
That's beyond me.
I'm afraid my books will be forgotten,

20:52.480 --> 20:54.311
like ephemera.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.238
Hello, what's that?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.315
Those flowerbeds
were perfectly neat earlier.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.834
Now some of the stalks are bent over.

21:08.640 --> 21:12.997
There you go. Who'd ever notice that?
You're brilliant.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.918
Oh! Someone came here tooled up.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.195
This is the sort of stuff
a thief would use.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.592
- The Unicorn, he's here.
- The Unicorn and the wasp.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.639
- Your drinks, ladies. Doctor.
- Very good, Greeves.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.356
How about the science stuff,
what did you find?

21:34.440 --> 21:37.796
Hmm. Vespiform sting.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.394
Vespiforms have got hives
in the Silfrax Galaxy.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.357
Again, you talk like Edward Lear.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.910
For some reason, this one's behaving
like a character in one of your books.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.275
Come on, Agatha,
what would Miss Marple do?

21:48.360 --> 21:50.396
She'd have overheard
something vital by now,

21:50.480 --> 21:53.119
because the murderer thinks
she's just a harmless old lady.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.633
Clever idea.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.677
Miss Marple, who writes those?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.228
Copyright Donna Noble.
Add it to the list.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.231
- Donna.
- Okay, we could split the copyright.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.995
No. Something's inhibiting my enzymes.

22:07.080 --> 22:11.119
I've been poisoned.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.634
What do we do? What do we do?

22:13.720 --> 22:17.952
It runs. It's cyanide.
Sparkling cyanide.

22:24.680 --> 22:25.795
- Ginger beer!
- I beg you pardon?

22:25.880 --> 22:29.350
- I need ginger beer.
- The gentleman has gone mad!

22:29.800 --> 22:32.553
I'm an expert in poisons, Doctor.
There's no cure.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.039
It's fatal.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.434
Not for me. I can stimulate
the inhibited enzymes into reversal.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.670
Protein. I need protein.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.910
- Walnuts?
- Bring it.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.835
Can't understand you. How many words?

22:46.920 --> 22:51.516
One. One word. Shake! Milk! Shake!
Milk! Milk! No, not milk!

22:51.600 --> 22:53.397
Um, shake, shake, shake!

22:53.480 --> 22:55.277
Cocktail shake!
You want a Harvey Wallbanger!

22:55.360 --> 22:57.715
- Harvey Wallbanger?
- Well, I don't know!

22:57.800 --> 22:59.313
How is Harvey Wallbanger one word!

22:59.400 --> 23:01.709
- What do you need, Doctor?
- Salt!

23:01.800 --> 23:04.030
I was miming salt.
Salt, I need something salty!

23:04.120 --> 23:06.270
- What about this?
- What is it?

23:06.360 --> 23:07.588
- Salt!
- That's too salty.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.148
- Oh, that's too salty.
- What about this?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.514
- Mmm...
- What's that?

23:11.600 --> 23:14.558
- Anchovies.
- What is it? What else?

23:15.000 --> 23:18.117
Um, it's a song! "Mammy"?

23:18.200 --> 23:21.670
- I don't know! Camptown Races.
- Camptown Races?

23:21.760 --> 23:24.069
All right, then. Towering Inferno!

23:24.160 --> 23:26.151
It's a shock! Look, shock.
I need a shock!

23:26.240 --> 23:28.913
All right, then, big shock, coming up.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.958
Detox! Oh!

23:46.120 --> 23:50.875
I must do that more often.
I mean the... the detox.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.555
Doctor, you are impossible. Who are you?

24:00.480 --> 24:04.632
Terrible day for all of us.
The professor struck down.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.675
Miss Chandrakala cruelly taken from us.
And yet we still take dinner.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.671
We are British, Doctor.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.277
What else must we do?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.920
And then someone
tried to poison me.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.150
Any one of you had the chance
to put cyanide in my drink.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.312
- But it rather gave me an idea.
- And what would that be?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.311
Well, poison.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.395
Drink up.

24:32.400 --> 24:37.520
- I've laced the soup with pepper.
- Mmm. I thought it was jolly spicy.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.717
But the active ingredient of pepper
is piperine.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.232
Traditionally used as an insecticide.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.270
Oh! Anyone got the shivers?

24:54.200 --> 24:56.350
- What the deuce...
- Listen, listen, listen.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.839
No, it can't be.

25:05.040 --> 25:07.759
- Show yourself, demon.
Nobody move.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.996
Oh, no. Stay where you are!

25:19.920 --> 25:21.876
Out, out, out, out, now!

25:24.800 --> 25:27.553
I'll cover you, Agatha. You've got
a long, long life to lead yet.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.278
Well, we know the butler didn't do it.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.759
Then, who did?

25:39.200 --> 25:44.911
My jewellery! The Firestone!
It's gone! Stolen!

25:45.440 --> 25:46.634
Roger.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.317
My son... My child!

26:15.040 --> 26:16.758
That poor footman!

26:18.200 --> 26:20.873
Roger is dead
and he can't even mourn him.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.872
1926, it's more like the Dark Ages.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.355
Did you inquire after the necklace?

26:26.440 --> 26:29.512
Lady Eddison brought it back from India.
It's worth thousands.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.114
This thing can sting,
it can fly.

26:33.840 --> 26:37.276
It could wipe us all out in seconds.
Why is playing this game?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.794
Every murder is essentially the same.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.678
They're committed
because somebody wants something.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.320
- What does a Vespiform want?
- Doctor, stop it.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.039
The murderer is as human as you or I.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.879
You're right.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.520
Oh, I've been so caught up
with giant wasps,

26:53.600 --> 26:55.636
I'd forgotten you're the expert.

26:55.720 --> 26:59.633
I'm not, I've told you.
I'm just a purveyor of nonsense.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.199
Oh, no, no, no, no.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.794
'Cause plenty of people write detective
stories, but yours are the best.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.111
Why? Why are you so good,
Agatha Christie?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.797
Because you understand. You've lived.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.349
You've fought,
you've had your heart broken.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.151
You know about people.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.791
Their passions, their hope and despair
and anger, all of those tiny,

27:21.880 --> 27:26.351
huge things that can turn
the most ordinary person into a killer.

27:27.200 --> 27:32.479
Just think, Agatha.
If anyone can solve this, it's you.

27:35.480 --> 27:38.517
I've called you here,
on this endless night,

27:39.520 --> 27:42.080
because we have a murderer in our midst.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.197
And when it comes to detection,
there's none finer.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.829
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Agatha Christie.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.438
This is a crooked house.
A house of secrets.

27:57.440 --> 28:00.796
To understand the solution,
we must examine them all.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.597
Starting with you, Miss Redmond.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.993
- But I'm innocent, surely.
- You've never met these people.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.594
And these people have never met you.

28:15.320 --> 28:19.154
I think the real Robina Redmond never
left London. You're impersonating her.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.755
How silly. What proof do you have?

28:22.840 --> 28:25.434
You said you'd been to the toilet...

28:25.840 --> 28:28.832
Oh, I know this. If she was really posh
she'd say loo.

28:28.920 --> 28:33.311
Earlier today,
Miss Noble and I found this on the lawn,

28:33.400 --> 28:36.119
right beneath your bathroom window.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.078
You must've heard that Miss Noble was
searching the bedroom, so you panicked.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.037
You ran upstairs
and disposed of the evidence.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.078
I've never seen that thing
before in my life.

28:48.160 --> 28:52.597
- What's inside it?
- The tools of your trade, Miss Redmond.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.874
Or should I say... the Unicorn?

28:58.680 --> 29:01.592
You came to this house
with one sole intention,

29:01.680 --> 29:04.194
to steal the Firestone.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.639
Oh, all right, then. It's a fair cop...

29:09.440 --> 29:14.468
Yes, I'm the bleeding Unicorn.
Ever so nice to meet you, I don't think.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.677
I took my chance in the dark
and nabbed it.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.035
Go on, then, you nobs.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.112
Arrest me. Sling me in jail.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.957
- So, is she the murderer?
- Don't be so thick.

29:28.040 --> 29:30.793
I might be a thief,
but I ain't no killer.

29:30.880 --> 29:36.876
Quite. There are darker motives at work
and in examining this household,

29:36.960 --> 29:38.951
we come to you,

29:39.040 --> 29:40.029
Colonel.

29:44.240 --> 29:47.949
Damn it, woman.
You with your perspicacity.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.758
You've rumbled me.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.231
You can walk!

29:54.080 --> 29:55.229
But why?

29:55.320 --> 29:59.916
My darling, how else could I be certain
of keeping you by my side?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.069
I don't understand.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.390
You're still a beautiful woman,
Clemency.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.392
Sooner or later,
some chap will turn your head.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.277
I couldn't bear that.

30:08.360 --> 30:12.672
Staying in the chair was the only way
I could be certain of keeping you.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.030
Confounded Mrs Christie!
How did you discover the truth?

30:17.120 --> 30:18.997
Um, actually I had no idea.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.036
I was just going to say
you were completely innocent.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.554
- Oh!
- Sorry.

30:24.400 --> 30:27.790
- Uh, shall I sit down, then?
- I think you better had.

30:29.280 --> 30:32.033
- So, he's not the murderer?
- Indeed not.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.039
To find the truth, let's return

30:37.400 --> 30:38.628
to this.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.069
Far more than the Unicorn's
object of desire.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.714
The Firestone has quite a history.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.195
- Lady Eddison...
- I've done nothing.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.236
You brought it back from India,
did you not?

30:53.320 --> 30:55.390
Before you met the Colonel.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.308
You came home with malaria

30:58.400 --> 31:01.676
and confined yourself to this house
for six months

31:01.760 --> 31:03.830
in a room that has been
kept locked ever since.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.434
- Which I rather think means...
- Stop, please.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.910
I'm so sorry,
but you had fallen pregnant in India.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.269
Unmarried and ashamed, you hurried back
to England with your confidante,

31:14.360 --> 31:17.432
a young maid, later to become
housekeeper, Miss Chandrakala.

31:17.520 --> 31:19.431
Clemency, is this true?

31:20.240 --> 31:25.234
My poor baby. I had to give him away.
The shame of it.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.833
But you've never said a word.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.912
I had no choice.
Imagine the scandal.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.436
The family name.
I'm British, I carry on.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.589
And it was no ordinary pregnancy.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.199
How can you know that?

31:39.280 --> 31:40.838
Excuse me, Agatha, this is my territory.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.911
But when you heard that
buzzing sound in the dining room,

31:43.000 --> 31:44.877
you said, "It can't be".

31:45.960 --> 31:48.952
- Why did you say that?
- You'd never believe it.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.158
The Doctor has opened my mind
to believe many things.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.109
It was 40 years ago,
in the heat of Delhi late one night.

32:01.200 --> 32:06.433
<i>I was alone and that's when I saw it.:
a dazzling light in the sky.</i>

32:07.280 --> 32:09.157
The next day he came to the house.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.237
<i>Christopher, the most handsome man
I'd ever seen.</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:17.231
<i>Our love blazed like a wildfire.</i>

32:18.640 --> 32:20.437
<i>I held nothing back.</i>

32:23.600 --> 32:25.238
And in return,

32:25.320 --> 32:28.551
he showed me an incredible truth
about himself.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.796
<i>He'd made himself human
to learn about us.</i>

32:32.880 --> 32:35.678
<i>This was his true shape.</i>

32:36.880 --> 32:41.590
I loved him so much, it didn't matter.
But he was stolen from me.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.513
1885, the year of the great monsoon,

32:45.600 --> 32:48.672
the river Jamuna rose up
and broke its banks.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.910
He was taken with the flood.

32:52.640 --> 32:57.236
<i>But Christopher left me a parting gift,
a jewel like no other.</i>

32:57.320 --> 33:00.118
<i>I wore it always,
part of me never forgot.</i>

33:00.400 --> 33:02.118
<i>I kept it close...</i>

33:03.600 --> 33:04.749
Always.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.398
Just like a man.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.313
Flashes his family jewels
and you end up with a bun in the oven.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.152
A poor little child.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.350
Forty years ago, Miss Chandrakala took
that newborn baby to an orphanage.

33:15.440 --> 33:19.069
But Professor Peach worked it out.
He found the birth certificate.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.913
- Oh, that's maiden. Maiden name.
Precisely.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.195
- So, she killed him.
- I did not!

33:24.280 --> 33:27.909
Miss Chandrakala feared that
the Professor had unearthed your secret.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.228
She was coming to warn you.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.197
- So, she killed her.
- I did not!

33:31.280 --> 33:34.272
Lady Eddison is innocent.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.232
Because at this point...

33:37.320 --> 33:38.435
Doctor.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.391
Thank you! At this point, when
we consider the lies and the secrets

33:43.480 --> 33:45.311
that are key to these events,

33:45.400 --> 33:49.393
then we have to consider
it was you, Donna Noble.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.711
What? What did I kill?

33:52.800 --> 33:56.031
No, but you said it all along,
the vital clue,

33:56.120 --> 33:58.588
that this whole thing is being acted out
like a murder mystery.

33:58.680 --> 34:03.037
Which means, it was you,
Agatha Christie.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.996
I beg your pardon, sir?

34:06.080 --> 34:08.469
- So, she killed them?
- No, but she wrote.

34:08.560 --> 34:12.757
She wrote those brilliant, clever books
and who is her greatest admirer?

34:12.840 --> 34:16.036
The moving finger points at you...

34:16.639 --> 34:19.359
- Lady Eddison.
- Oh, leave me alone.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.396
- So, she did kill them.
- No.

34:21.480 --> 34:24.916
But just think. Last Thursday night,
what were you doing?

34:25.000 --> 34:28.754
Uh, I was, uh, I was in the library.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.071
<i>I was reading my favourite
Agatha Christie,</i>

34:33.159 --> 34:36.516
<i>thinking about her plots
and how clever she must be.</i>

34:36.880 --> 34:39.393
- How is that relevant?
- Just think.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.594
What else happened on Thursday night?

34:46.159 --> 34:49.277
- I'm sorry?
- You said on the lawn this afternoon.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.272
Last Thursday night,
those boys broke into your church.

34:52.360 --> 34:54.793
That's correct. They did.

34:59.400 --> 35:02.392
<i>I discovered the two of them.
Thieves in the night.</i>

35:02.480 --> 35:04.311
<i>I was most perturbed.</i>

35:04.800 --> 35:08.395
What the blazes are you doing, boys?

35:10.640 --> 35:12.631
But I apprehended them.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.351
Really? A man of God
against two strong lads?

35:16.440 --> 35:21.594
A man in his 40's?
Or should I say, 40 years old?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.834
- Exactly.
- Oh, my God!

35:26.720 --> 35:30.952
Lady Eddison, your child,
how old would he be now?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.713
Forty! He's 40.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.436
Your child has come home.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.031
- This is poppycock.
Oh?

35:40.120 --> 35:41.951
You said you were taught
by the Christian fathers,

35:42.040 --> 35:44.679
meaning, raised in an orphanage.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.638
My son! Can it be?

35:47.720 --> 35:51.156
You found those thieves, Reverend,
and you got angry.

35:51.240 --> 35:53.435
A proper, deep anger for the first time
in your life

35:53.520 --> 35:55.795
and it broke the genetic lock.

35:56.080 --> 35:56.990
You changed.

36:00.040 --> 36:06.354
Put those things back
where you found them.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.793
It's...

36:17.200 --> 36:20.954
You realised your inheritance
after all these years.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.832
You knew who you were.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.798
Oh! And then it all kicks off.
'Cause this isn't just a jewel.

36:26.880 --> 36:31.908
It's a Vespiform telepathic recorder.
It's part of you, your brain.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.759
Your very essence.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.798
And when you activated,
so did the Firestone.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.997
It beamed your full identity
directly into your mind.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.593
And at the same time,

36:42.400 --> 36:46.757
it absorbed the works of Agatha Christie
directly from Lady Eddison.

36:46.840 --> 36:48.876
<i>It all became part of you.</i>

36:49.200 --> 36:52.875
<i>The mechanics of those novels
re-templated in your brain.</i>

36:53.520 --> 36:55.112
You killed in this pattern,

36:55.200 --> 36:57.634
because that's what you think
the world is.

36:57.720 --> 37:00.154
Turns out we are in the middle
of a murder mystery.

37:00.240 --> 37:03.232
- One of yours, Dame Agatha.
- Dame?

37:03.320 --> 37:05.390
Oh! It's all right, not yet.

37:05.480 --> 37:10.076
- So he killed them? Yes? Definitely?
- Yes.

37:10.680 --> 37:11.908
Well...

37:12.720 --> 37:16.030
This has certainly been
a most entertaining evening.

37:16.840 --> 37:20.037
Really, you can't believe any of this,
surely, Lady Eddison?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.639
Lady who?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.510
Lady Eddison...

37:25.600 --> 37:29.070
- Little bit of buzzing there, Vicar.
- Don't make me angry!

37:29.160 --> 37:31.196
Why? What happens then?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.310
Damn it! You humans

37:35.400 --> 37:37.994
worshipping your tribal sky gods...

37:38.640 --> 37:40.437
I am so much more.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.592
That night, the universe
exploded in my mind.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.558
I wanted to take
what was mine!

37:46.640 --> 37:52.158
And you, Agatha Christie, with your
railway station bookstall romances...

37:53.160 --> 37:55.469
What's to stop me killing you?

37:55.560 --> 37:58.028
Oh, my dear God. My child!

37:58.120 --> 38:01.237
What's to stop me killing you all?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.510
- It's me...
- No, no. Clemency, come back...

38:06.600 --> 38:08.955
Keep away. Keep away, my God!

38:09.040 --> 38:11.952
No! No! No more murder.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.758
If my imagination made you kill,

38:13.840 --> 38:17.753
then my imagination will find a way
to stop you, foul creature.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.910
Run! He's chasing us.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.635
Come here!
Come and get me, Reverend!

38:33.720 --> 38:35.597
Agatha, what are you doing?

38:35.680 --> 38:38.114
If I started this, Doctor,
then I must stop it.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.354
Come on!

38:53.960 --> 38:57.111
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.
It's all my fault.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.194
You said this is the night
Agatha Christie loses her memory?

39:02.280 --> 39:03.872
Time is in flux, Donna.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.269
For all we know, this is the night
Agatha Christie loses her life

39:06.360 --> 39:07.679
and history gets changed.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.432
But where is she going?

39:21.320 --> 39:24.835
The lake! She's heading for the lake.
What's she doing?

39:32.440 --> 39:35.352
Here I am, the honey in the trap.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.560
- Come to me, Vespiform.
- She's controlling him!

39:38.640 --> 39:41.313
His mind is based on her
thought processes. They're linked!

39:41.400 --> 39:45.678
Quite so, Doctor. If I die,
then this creature might die with me.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.993
Don't hurt her!

39:48.080 --> 39:51.356
You're not meant to be like this.
You've got the wrong template your mind.

39:51.440 --> 39:53.112
He's not listening.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.237
How do you kill a wasp?

40:19.920 --> 40:22.832
Drown him, just like his father.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.151
- Donna, that thing couldn't help itself.
- Neither could I.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.028
Death comes as the end
and justice is served.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.595
Murder at the Vicar's Rage.

40:40.160 --> 40:44.153
- Needs a bit of work.
- Just one mystery left, Doctor.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.390
Who exactly are you?

40:50.480 --> 40:53.870
Oh, it's the Firestone.
It's part of the Vespiform's mind.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.758
It's dying and it's connected to Agatha.

41:05.520 --> 41:06.999
He let her go.

41:07.760 --> 41:11.275
Right at the end, the Vespiform chose
to save someone's life.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.670
- Is she all right, though?
- Oh, of course, the amnesia.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.354
Wiped her mind of everything
that happened, the wasp, the murders...

41:17.440 --> 41:20.637
And us. She'll forget about us.

41:20.720 --> 41:25.271
Yeah, but we solved another riddle.
The mystery of Agatha Christie.

41:25.360 --> 41:29.478
And tomorrow morning, her car
gets found by the side of the lake.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.709
<i>A few days later,
she turns up in a hotel in Harrogate.</i>

41:33.800 --> 41:36.268
<i>With no idea of what just happened.</i>

41:41.400 --> 41:43.197
No one will ever know.

41:44.640 --> 41:48.110
Lady Eddison, the Colonel,
and all the staff, what about them?

41:48.200 --> 41:51.476
Shameful story.
They'll never talk of it. Too British.

41:51.960 --> 41:56.078
While the Unicorn does a bunk
back to London town,

41:56.160 --> 41:58.037
she can even say she was never there.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.918
- What happens to Agatha?
- Oh, great life!

42:02.000 --> 42:04.150
Met another man. Married again.

42:04.240 --> 42:07.038
Toured the world.
Wrote and wrote and wrote.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.475
She never thought her books
were any good, though.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.757
And she must have spent
all those years wondering.

42:14.640 --> 42:18.189
Thing is...
I don't think she ever quite forgot.

42:19.680 --> 42:23.355
Great mind like that, some of
the details kept bleeding through.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.796
All the stuff her imagination could use,
like, Miss Marple.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.873
- I should have made her sign a contract.
- And where is it? Where is it? Hold on.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.079
Here we go.

42:37.240 --> 42:38.389
C!

42:40.680 --> 42:42.910
That is C for Cybermen,

42:43.960 --> 42:45.791
C for Carrionites...

42:48.120 --> 42:51.795
And... Christie, Agatha!

42:52.440 --> 42:55.079
- Look at that.
- She did remember.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.277
Somewhere at the back of her mind,
it all lingered.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.597
And that's not all.
Look at the copyright page.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.792
"Facsimile Edition,
published in the year... "

43:12.960 --> 43:16.919
- Five billion?
- People never stop reading them.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.072
She is the bestselling novelist
of all time.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.678
But she never knew.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.239
Well, no one knows
how they're going to be remembered,

43:25.320 --> 43:29.518
all you can do is hope for the best.
Maybe that's what kept her writing.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.515
Same thing keeps me travelling.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.719
Onwards?

43:35.800 --> 43:37.074
Onwards.

43:41.920 --> 43:45.469
This is the biggest library
in the universe. So where is everyone?

43:47.200 --> 43:49.509
Run. For God's sake, run.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.715
Run!

43:55.560 --> 43:58.199
Professor River Song, Archaeologist.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.918
The shadows are moving again.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.319
How can a shadow be infected?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.674
It's a Vashta Nerada.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.512
Run!
- What's CAL?

44:04.600 --> 44:07.239
So, they came to this library
and killed everything in it?

44:07.360 --> 44:09.078
- Donna?
- Yeah.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.999
Stay out of the shadows.

44:11.305 --> 44:17.935
