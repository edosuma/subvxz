WEBVTT

00:35.035 --> 00:35.770
<i>Previously...</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:37.438
I wonder where the sin-eater is.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.439
<i>No one's seen him in a while.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:39.407
Mama!

00:40.775 --> 00:43.110
I came and touched him,
and then he took me.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.246
She's with child by someone and no by me.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.782
<i>I've seen
the scars on your naked body.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:50.651
I suppose you could take
the bastard for yer wife to rear.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.219
Get out.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.088
Do you believe me about Malva?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.289
Yes.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.057
I think we should set Evan up with Lizzie.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.292
<i>If he can get past Josiah</i>

00:58.359 --> 00:59.660
<i>and Kezzie Beardsley, that is.</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:01.362
<i>Lonely, are ye?</i>

01:01.429 --> 01:02.696
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:09.603 --> 01:12.072
<i>You come near
me or my husband again,</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:14.542
and I will fucking kill you.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.146
Oh, no!

01:22.716 --> 01:24.752
I'm standing before you today

01:25.719 --> 01:28.155
to tell you that the devil is real.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.193
<i>They say he comes
in the guise of an angel.</i>

01:34.094 --> 01:37.698
But he spoke to me in the guise of a man.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.437
Seduced me.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.641
<i>I lost my innocence.</i>

01:49.477 --> 01:51.445
It was stolen.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.450
Taken by someone I trusted.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.289
Who made promises.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.362
<i>Who was supposed to be kind to me.</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:18.305
My baby will be a bastard in your eyes.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.176
But I hope you can see it in your hearts
to treat us kindly.

You didn't see anyone at all?

04:32.973 --> 04:33.941
No.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.579
Doesn't make sense.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.484
Ye must have seen something.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.753
<i>Or someone.</i>

04:45.986 --> 04:48.455
I was busy in the surgery.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.692
<i>Thought I saw Malva
coming towards the house.</i>

04:51.925 --> 04:54.061
She may have knocked, but...

04:54.328 --> 04:55.796
And you didn't answer the door?

04:56.597 --> 05:00.034
Why did you go outside then? With a knife?

05:01.335 --> 05:03.370
It's a pruning knife, for God's sake.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.838
I was going to the garden.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.507
What are ye implying, lad?

05:08.575 --> 05:11.912
Yer wife stands before
us up to her elbows in blood.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.982
I don't think we're implying anything.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.583
I told you.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.888
By the time I found Malva,

05:20.954 --> 05:22.956
whoever did this, they were gone.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.858
<i>She was already dead.</i>

05:25.426 --> 05:27.461
<i>But I had to try and save the baby.</i>

05:29.396 --> 05:30.764
You believe me, don't you?

05:30.831 --> 05:31.999
Was it swift?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.702
<i>I want to hear it from a healer's lips.</i>

05:34.902 --> 05:37.071
How long would
it have taken for her to die?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.772
If you're asking me
if she suffered, then--

05:38.839 --> 05:39.807
<i>Tell me.</i>

05:40.741 --> 05:41.709
How long?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.545
With the cut to her throat...

05:47.047 --> 05:48.782
...it would have been quick.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.386
No time to pray for forgiveness, then.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.825
A short prayer that would
have made her right with God.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.663
We'll bury them out in the woods.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.964
We will not.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.900
Can't bury a whore
and an illegitimate child

06:06.967 --> 06:08.602
beside God-fearing men and women.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.105
- She was yer daughter.
- He was yer bastard son.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.439
He is not.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.641
<i>Whoever he belongs to,</i>

06:16.143 --> 06:18.479
we'll see Malva and yer wee grandson

06:18.812 --> 06:20.080
<i>lain to rest properly.</i>

06:21.448 --> 06:22.649
Please, Mr. Christie.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.787
What? And have the angels weeping
and demons rejoicing

06:26.854 --> 06:29.823
that a sinner has
been buried in holy ground?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.525
<i>Over my dead body.</i>

06:38.632 --> 06:39.633
No.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.168
Over mine.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.571
If Malva and the bairn

06:44.638 --> 06:46.907
are to be buried on my ground,
at the Ridge,

06:47.107 --> 06:50.711
<i>it'll be after her funeral,
in a consecrated grave.</i>

06:50.778 --> 06:52.746
<i>Have I made myself clear?</i>

07:02.823 --> 07:05.959
What are we gonna
stand up and say about her, eh?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.029
That Malva Christie

07:10.430 --> 07:14.601
was full of life and light,

07:14.968 --> 07:16.837
<i>that there was fire in her eyes.</i>

07:17.771 --> 07:19.940
And when I held her tiny baby,

07:22.042 --> 07:24.611
I felt that same light in him.

07:24.945 --> 07:25.913
But...

07:29.183 --> 07:30.818
the state of the body.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.822
I'll take care of her.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.859
We'll gather at
the Meeting House in a few days.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.062
<i>My son-in-law will lead the service.</i>

09:28.035 --> 09:29.670
<i>You said it was medicine,</i>

09:29.736 --> 09:30.938
<i>but it's not.</i>

09:32.172 --> 09:33.840
<i>It's of the devil.</i>

09:34.141 --> 09:35.943
<i>You're of the devil.</i>

09:50.691 --> 09:52.626
<i>Plucked up the courage</i>

09:52.693 --> 09:53.927
<i>to kill this one yourself, did you?</i>

09:53.994 --> 09:54.962
<i>Ha.</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:59.266
I mean, you best pull yourself together.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.937
We don't want Jamie
coming rushin' in here to save you.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.054
'Cause you know something?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.225
He can't save you from yourself.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.907
Wouldn't blame you if there's none left.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.278
<i>I think I'll have one as well.</i>

11:22.983 --> 11:24.451
Did you find anything?

11:26.820 --> 11:27.788
No.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.292
Ian's still out searchin'.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.096
<i>He'll warn Roger, Bree, the settlers.</i>

11:36.263 --> 11:39.066
The Beardsleys
should be wi' him by now too.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.904
Pray to God he finds something.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.807
Who would do something like this?

11:49.109 --> 11:51.311
Where's that Lizzie to answer the door?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.915
Mr. Crombie is out on
the back porch to see you.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.486
He's been poking about the garden.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.321
<i>What shall I tell him?</i>

12:03.457 --> 12:05.258
Must've spoken with Tom.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.794
Well, I hope ye have an answer for me.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.264
<i>There'll be others
asking what's happened as well.</i>

12:11.331 --> 12:13.233
I told him to come back later.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.769
But he was muttering about

12:15.836 --> 12:18.171
wantin' to see the dead lass for himself.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.973
- No.
- There's no need.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.109
Malva has suffered enough indignity.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.277
What about the rest of us?

12:24.511 --> 12:26.847
<i>To live wi' such a scandal!</i>

12:27.114 --> 12:28.849
<i>Blessed Mary.</i>

12:29.116 --> 12:30.150
I knew she was trouble

12:30.217 --> 12:31.885
from the first moment I laid eyes on her.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.054
<i>You must have seen it too, Mistress.</i>

12:34.121 --> 12:35.088
No.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.225
I never thought anything.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.828
After that dreadful
accusation and her confessin'

12:41.895 --> 12:43.096
to all and sundry in the meetin' place

12:43.163 --> 12:46.133
that it was Mr.
Fraser's bairn she was carryin'.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.536
You must've hated her guts.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.037
That's enough.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.373
<i>The dead canna speak for themselves.</i>

12:53.807 --> 12:55.008
It's the livin' we must watch.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.778
Shall I show Mr. Crombie in?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.547
Tell him to wait for us outside.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.391
I don't want anyone
else to see me like this.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.827
Dinna fash, <i>mo nighean.</i>

13:14.961 --> 13:17.230
I'll speak wi' Hiram.
Find out why he's come.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.422
<i>Thank you again,
for comin' by, Hiram.</i>

13:43.557 --> 13:45.192
<i>I'll be sure to ask Roger to read from</i>

13:45.258 --> 13:47.327
Mr. Christie's Bible durin' the service.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.203
I'll never forget Mr. Christie's
face when he told me.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.371
And Allan.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.242
- Poor lad.
- Aye.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.445
It's a terrible shock for us all.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.148
Was it, then?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.556
Speak plainly.

14:19.125 --> 14:22.929
If you're to make
unfounded accusations on my doorstep,

14:22.996 --> 14:26.299
you'll do it in no uncertain terms.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.868
You sinned in the eyes of the Lord.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.206
Did yer wife forgive ye

14:33.273 --> 14:35.609
for lyin' wi'
a flowered-face Scottish lass?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.577
Now, Mr. Fraser,

14:38.545 --> 14:40.880
let every man be swift
to hear and slow to anger.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.383
<i>Are we all to suffer on the Ridge</i>

14:43.450 --> 14:46.052
because ye regret
marryin' a jealous English woman

14:46.119 --> 14:49.089
with a sharp tongue
and even sharper knives?

14:51.358 --> 14:55.195
Did yer wife forgive Malva?

15:11.311 --> 15:12.912
If you value yer life,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.983
choose yer next words wisely, Mr. Crombie.

15:43.009 --> 15:47.514
So, what, you thought Hiram Crombie'd
come lookin' to beg for a cup of sugar?

15:49.215 --> 15:51.451
He just about has the measure o' you.

15:52.385 --> 15:55.722
<i>And he won't be shy
about telling his friends.</i>

15:59.292 --> 16:01.661
You're selfish. That's what you are.

16:04.497 --> 16:07.467
<i>You took the life of
an innocent young girl</i>

16:07.534 --> 16:10.103
<i>to protect that husband of yours,
didn't you?</i>

16:10.337 --> 16:13.973
When you swore to do no harm.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.350
<i>Not as if you haven't done that before,
though, is it?</i>

16:27.253 --> 16:28.521
<i>The lying,</i>

16:29.456 --> 16:31.124
<i>the loveless marriage,</i>

16:32.525 --> 16:34.561
<i>leaving when you should have stayed,</i>

16:36.396 --> 16:38.765
<i>staying when you should have gone.</i>

16:45.472 --> 16:47.507
I should go see Tom and Allan soon.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.442
I feel I should be

16:49.509 --> 16:51.544
comfortin' them in their hour of need.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.546
Don't worry.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.249
They probably need
some time alone with their grief.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.018
And I doubt they'll be expecting you.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.553
You know you're not the minister.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.058
Da, is there anything we can do?

17:06.326 --> 17:09.129
I think it's yer
turn to pacify Mrs. Bug.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.798
And what is it now, lass?

17:12.065 --> 17:14.634
Obadiah Henderson at
the door askin' about Mr. Murray.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.803
I did say he wasna here, but...

17:19.305 --> 17:21.040
What have you been up to, Lizzie?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.143
<i>Mrs.
Bug was lookin' for you earlier</i>

17:23.209 --> 17:24.811
<i>- and worried about you.</i>
- I was...

17:25.078 --> 17:26.713
just out feedin' the horses.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.150
But I came back to the house
as soon as I heard the terrible news.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.718
I don't want you going out alone.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.253
Dinna ken who's about.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.554
I'll go with you.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.156
<i>Come on then, Roger Mac.</i>

17:43.263 --> 17:44.531
Mr. Henderson.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.434
Why is Murray roaming 'round

17:47.500 --> 17:48.735
like the damn Spanish Inquisition?

17:48.802 --> 17:50.336
What right does he have, eh?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.738
Ye know he hit me a few months ago.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.773
Gave me a black eye because of Malva.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.809
I understand
how upset you must be.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.412
My condolences, Mr. Henderson.
It's a terrible thing

17:59.479 --> 18:02.115
for everyone who knew Miss Christie.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.351
I offer my deepest
sympathies to her family.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.754
You don't need to
offer me yer condolences.

18:07.821 --> 18:11.124
I only mean
that I know that you were friends.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.293
Perhaps more?

18:13.359 --> 18:14.594
And what are ye suggesting?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.130
<i>You think I had something to do with this?</i>

18:17.464 --> 18:18.598
<i>Is that what ye told Murray?</i>

18:19.632 --> 18:22.202
And you have the gall to
say that to me in front of him?

18:22.469 --> 18:25.505
Mr. MacKenzie's no suggesting.
Askin' is all.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.740
Everyone on the Ridge has questions

18:28.208 --> 18:30.176
<i>about you and yer wife.</i>

18:30.343 --> 18:32.111
Is it true she cut
the baby out of Malva's belly

18:32.178 --> 18:33.480
before she slit her throat?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.148
Or was it the other way around?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.687
I'm glad to have you on the Ridge,
Mr. Henderson, but--

18:40.753 --> 18:42.622
But what, Mr. Fraser?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.357
Are you goin' to threaten me?

18:45.291 --> 18:46.726
Same way ye threatened Mr. Crombie?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.796
I saw you with Malva. As you know.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.899
I hadn't seen her. Not for some time.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.734
I told yer nephew the same thing.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.536
And he better not forget it,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.338
unless he wants a black eye in return.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.706
I'll keep that in mind.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.841
Good day to ye, Mr. Henderson.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.612
Maybe Murray ought to start
askin' questions a little closer to home.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.841
I'm sorry I lied about
feedin' you earlier, Gideon.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.210
Do you forgive me?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.583
<i>Lizzie.</i>

19:44.450 --> 19:46.219
Have you seen the Beardsleys anywhere?

19:46.586 --> 19:50.423
Uncle Jamie wanted them to come help me
search the Ridge, but I couldna find them.

19:50.490 --> 19:54.460
Uh, well, not really.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.563
Uh, but they should be home by now,
I think.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.766
Is there somethin' ye're no telling me?

19:59.966 --> 20:02.402
Surely, you couldna think that they...

20:05.638 --> 20:07.540
'Tis only that I dinna
want them to be in any trouble.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.542
What trouble could they be in?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.579
<i>I-I dinna ken what you're hiding,</i>

20:13.279 --> 20:14.814
but ye have to tell me the truth.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.618
<i>Uncle Jamie's gonna be
askin' why they weren't with me.</i>

20:19.519 --> 20:23.723
Lizzie, if you know
something or saw something...

20:29.395 --> 20:30.797
<i>It's hard to
imagine anyone on the Ridge</i>

20:30.863 --> 20:32.231
<i>doin' such a terrible thing.</i>

20:32.799 --> 20:34.934
Some cold potatoes and butter.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.671
Uh, shall I set
a plate for Mistress Fraser?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.841
Thank you, Lizzie.
Nah, she's upstairs, restin'.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.811
We canna rule out anyone.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.780
Except Obadiah already
knew that I knew about them.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.483
So, unless someone else

20:50.550 --> 20:52.418
disapproved of their relations...

20:52.652 --> 20:55.688
Well, I think
we know it wasna the sin-eater.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.658
<i>Not a pretty sight when I found him.</i>

20:58.725 --> 20:59.726
<i>Poor man.</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:01.894
Must ha' died all alone in his hut.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.396
Sorry to hear that.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.899
I hope the Beardsleys
helped you bury him decently.

21:07.467 --> 21:12.372
Um, no, but... well, they thought it best
to conduct a search of their own,

21:12.772 --> 21:14.007
in another part of the woods.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.909
That's prudent.
Cover more ground that way.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.811
<i>I wonder
what the sin-eater died of.</i>

21:18.878 --> 21:20.980
Looked as if he must
ha' passed away in his sleep.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.616
But the strange thing was that

21:24.450 --> 21:26.619
his finger bones were
missin' on one of his hands.

21:26.686 --> 21:27.920
His finger bones? You sure?

21:27.987 --> 21:28.988
Aye.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.658
I wonder if it has anything to do
with that love charm we found.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.529
Ye think it was a jealous
woman who made it and killed Malva?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.332
Circumstantial
evidence might point towards it,

21:39.399 --> 21:41.968
<i>but provin' it beyond a reasonable doubt?</i>

21:42.035 --> 21:43.603
<i>Where's Perry Mason
when you need him, eh?</i>

21:43.670 --> 21:45.705
<i>Aye, I know. Where do we start?</i>

21:46.039 --> 21:47.907
It's not as if we can report it to police,

21:48.341 --> 21:49.876
<i>or report this matter to anyone.</i>

21:50.510 --> 21:51.811
Who's Perry Mason?

21:51.878 --> 21:53.946
He's a lawyer from our time.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.449
He defends the falsely-accused.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.651
I think the question he'd be asking

21:58.718 --> 22:03.089
is who would've had the means, motive,
and the opportunity?

22:03.356 --> 22:04.490
<i>Me.</i>

22:15.368 --> 22:16.469
Ye didna do it.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.839
Why do ye even
suggest such a thing, Sassenach?

22:20.973 --> 22:22.909
I have this feeling.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.712
You know, when you leave the house

22:25.778 --> 22:27.580
and you think you've left the oven on.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.116
I mean, a candle burning.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.018
You know you probably haven't.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.088
You've never done it before, but...

22:35.988 --> 22:37.924
what if this is the time that you did,

22:37.990 --> 22:39.959
and this is the time
the house burns down, and...

22:42.061 --> 22:44.430
you just can't shake the thought.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.898
What are ye sayin'?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.136
When I saw Malva

22:50.403 --> 22:52.405
coming towards the house, I...

22:53.506 --> 22:56.576
I took some Ether
and then I--I had a lie down.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.446
Christ, Sassenach,
you put yerself to sleep?

23:01.781 --> 23:03.916
Just a little bit. I--

23:03.983 --> 23:05.518
I didn't want to talk to her.

23:08.521 --> 23:12.658
<i>But I have this... half-remembered dream.</i>

23:14.794 --> 23:16.162
It's a nightmare, really.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.965
<i>Malva was banging at the door and...</i>

23:19.031 --> 23:21.400
<i>then all of a sudden,
she was inside the surgery.</i>

23:22.034 --> 23:23.836
She shook me awake and...

23:24.937 --> 23:26.672
and I lost my temper, and I...

23:27.540 --> 23:28.941
I threatened her.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.010
<i>What if it wasn't a dream?</i>

23:31.844 --> 23:34.781
<i>What...if I did do it?</i>

23:39.118 --> 23:41.554
Yer mind's playin' tricks on you.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.489
Ye didna harm her.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.424
<i>You're not capable.</i>

23:45.491 --> 23:46.859
But you heard what Roger said.

23:47.894 --> 23:51.464
About who had the means
and the motive and the opportunity.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.033
<i>If you look at it from the outside, well,</i>

23:54.767 --> 23:57.470
I had all three,
and everyone thinks it's me.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.572
So what if they do?

23:59.639 --> 24:01.107
Doesna matter what they think.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.844
Whoever it was,

24:05.444 --> 24:06.445
we'll find them.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.614
We'll keep lookin'.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.867
<i>Funny. We never
say that we're "only human"</i>

25:00.933 --> 25:04.103
<i>when we've done
something good or worthy of praise.</i>

25:04.170 --> 25:08.674
<i>Instead, it's what we tell ourselves
to excuse our mistakes.</i>

25:09.609 --> 25:12.845
<i>An effort, perhaps,
to convince ourselves that</i>

25:12.912 --> 25:15.248
<i>the person we see
looking back at us in the mirror</i>

25:15.514 --> 25:16.949
<i>really isn't so bad.</i>

25:24.790 --> 25:26.692
<i>But who was I now?</i>

25:26.759 --> 25:28.995
<i>What was I now?</i>

25:31.130 --> 25:36.569
<i>Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp.
Dr. Randall. Mistress Fraser.</i>

25:36.636 --> 25:39.805
<i>Wife. Mother. Grandmother.</i>

25:40.106 --> 25:43.776
<i>Witch. Murderer.</i>

25:43.843 --> 25:46.779
<i>"Murderess" suits best.</i>

25:51.584 --> 25:53.653
Aunty Claire, Uncle Jamie.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.789
There's something I must tell you.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.026
Is it to do with Malva?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.194
It's Lizzie.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.006
She's...

26:15.241 --> 26:16.709
with child.

26:19.312 --> 26:20.713
Is it yers?

26:20.913 --> 26:23.149
- Uh, no, Uncle.
- Then who?

26:23.616 --> 26:24.817
Who debauched her?

26:25.584 --> 26:26.686
Give me his name.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.021
Beardsley.

26:30.022 --> 26:30.990
Beardsley?

26:32.358 --> 26:33.326
Which of them was it?

26:34.994 --> 26:37.196
She doesn't know which one is the father.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.101
You mean...

26:42.702 --> 26:43.703
both of them?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.143
I'll have the two of them in.

26:51.677 --> 26:52.945
Find out the truth of it.

26:53.012 --> 26:53.846
Christ!

26:56.782 --> 26:57.984
If word of this spreads...

26:58.050 --> 26:59.385
I'm sorry, Uncle.

27:00.353 --> 27:02.855
I couldna say anythin' at dinner.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.024
Didna want to embarrass Lizzie.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.227
But wi' folks
speculatin' about Malva being killed

27:08.294 --> 27:10.296
because she was unwed and wi' child,

27:10.930 --> 27:12.031
I thought ye should know.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.200
I'll speak to her.

27:14.667 --> 27:18.637
I'll see one of them wed to Lizzie
or both Beardsleys dead at her feet.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.090
How's the sermon coming?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.425
It's comin'.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.894
Ah, you've done more work than me.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.096
I just don't feel up to it,

27:44.330 --> 27:45.998
with everything that's happened.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.135
- And now...
- What?

27:50.803 --> 27:53.272
Jemmy just told me
he heard Mr. Bug telling Mrs. Bug

27:53.339 --> 27:55.307
that all murdered people turn into ghosts.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.010
And it's really frightened him.

27:58.077 --> 27:59.812
<i>The old fool.</i>

28:00.980 --> 28:02.948
But does Jemmy even
really know what that means?

28:04.316 --> 28:05.951
Just tell him
that there's nothin' to be afraid of

28:06.018 --> 28:10.189
and to say a prayer if
he thinks he's seen a ghost.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.158
I did. And then he asked me

28:12.224 --> 28:15.194
if that would stop his granny
turning him into a ghost too.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.097
Who told him that? Who said it was Claire?

28:18.164 --> 28:20.199
The fisherfolk, apparently.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.941
How far along are you?

28:30.376 --> 28:32.812
Few months or so, maybe.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.180
And is he right?

28:35.314 --> 28:36.782
Both the Beardsleys?

28:37.016 --> 28:37.950
Well...

28:39.351 --> 28:41.987
I swear I hadna done it before, Mistress.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.255
I mean, I'd maybe come close a time--

28:43.322 --> 28:44.323
Lizzie.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.327
Ye see, it all started when

28:48.994 --> 28:51.330
you and Mr. Fraser were away.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.899
The Malaria came back,

28:54.967 --> 28:58.304
and I could feel the fever comin' for me.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.874
My blood runnin' hot an' cold.

29:03.075 --> 29:07.246
My teeth were clackin' so hard together
I thought they'd break.

29:08.347 --> 29:12.751
And then the Beardsley lads
arrived with my gallberry ointment.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.989
And I said that they must rub it all over.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.126
And then...

29:20.893 --> 29:24.230
one of the lads said
that he might spoil his shirt.

29:25.865 --> 29:29.168
So I said perhaps better to take it off.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.003
I see.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.038
Then, well...

29:34.874 --> 29:36.909
<i>One thing led to another.</i>

29:39.979 --> 29:42.414
Both of them at once?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.150
I didn't mean to.

29:45.317 --> 29:48.387
I mean, I did, but...

29:48.454 --> 29:50.890
Elizabeth Wemyss,
I'm not sure it's possible

29:50.956 --> 29:53.025
to engage in sexual relations with two men

29:53.092 --> 29:54.894
<i>without meaning to.</i>

29:55.227 --> 29:57.029
Or do you mean

29:57.096 --> 29:59.899
you thought it was one
twin and then they fooled you?

30:00.199 --> 30:02.168
No, Mistress.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.303
Oh, ye mustn't think that Jo or Kezzie

30:04.370 --> 30:05.938
could do such a thing.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.109
It was my choice.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.944
I swear.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.446
That's a relief, I suppose.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.115
But I had to ask.

30:16.182 --> 30:19.218
I felt...safe

30:20.085 --> 30:22.021
wi' arms around me.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.392
I remember openin' my eyes

30:26.458 --> 30:29.562
and seein' a chest before my face.

30:30.996 --> 30:36.936
Dark curlies all 'round his paps,
wee and brown and wrinkled like raisins.

30:37.236 --> 30:42.208
Oh, they're identical everywhere,

30:42.875 --> 30:44.577
<i>if ye take my meanin'.</i>

30:47.012 --> 30:50.249
I ken well enough what I was doing.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.219
But we were...

30:53.586 --> 30:55.354
slippery wi' the ointment,

30:55.421 --> 30:59.325
and naked under the quilts.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.127
And it happened.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.064
And kept on happening. <i>- Aye.</i>

31:05.264 --> 31:07.900
More than once with
each of them since then.

31:10.002 --> 31:14.306
It feels so nice, Mistress.

31:14.373 --> 31:18.244
That may be, and I'm glad
you're enjoying yourself, but--

31:18.310 --> 31:22.081
I ken it seems strange.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.085
And I suppose
I ought to have said something

31:26.151 --> 31:29.355
or done something, but...

31:29.421 --> 31:31.056
I couldna think what.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.126
And really,

31:35.461 --> 31:37.429
it didna seem wrong at all.

31:37.496 --> 31:38.931
Lizzie,

31:39.898 --> 31:42.301
you're risking a huge scandal.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.105
<i>If Hiram Crombie, for one,</i>

31:46.405 --> 31:48.007
if he found out,

31:49.108 --> 31:50.976
he'd stone you for fornication.

31:51.043 --> 31:51.977
Why?

31:53.379 --> 31:54.947
It's no harmin' anyone.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.250
And it's no one's business but ours.

31:58.617 --> 32:02.154
Everything that happens
here is everyone's business.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.555
You know that.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.259
And now you're with child.

32:07.326 --> 32:10.562
Aye. 'Tis a miracle, is it not?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.932
Have the three of
you worked out a plan at least?

32:14.099 --> 32:16.068
<i>There's only going to be one thing to do</i>

32:16.135 --> 32:18.037
<i>in Mr. Fraser's books,
and that's to marry.</i>

32:18.437 --> 32:20.172
You can't have both.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.308
Doesn't work that way.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.477
But we've been so...happy.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.113
Well, if both the Beardsleys

32:28.180 --> 32:30.516
are still alive after
Mr. Fraser finds them,

32:31.150 --> 32:32.518
he may take matters into his own hands

32:32.584 --> 32:35.054
<i>and solve that problem for you.</i>

32:43.996 --> 32:45.030
Has Ian returned yet?

32:45.364 --> 32:46.231
No.

32:50.202 --> 32:53.605
Mr. Bug! A moment, if ye please.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.314
Somehow or other,
Jemmy has got it into his head

33:02.381 --> 33:05.284
that there are some souls
wi' a lot of unfinished business

33:05.351 --> 33:06.685
here on the Ridge.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.755
Oh, the wee scamp heard that, did he?

33:10.022 --> 33:12.191
Aye, and he's terrified.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.626
If you could be a bit
more careful around him, please.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.628
Well, that's life for you.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.666
Ye canna shelter
the lad from such things forever.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.370
In fact, there's a sow to be slaughtered

33:24.436 --> 33:26.505
if ye need bacon before Mrs. Bug and I

33:26.572 --> 33:28.574
take the whisky up to River Run.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.143
I'd ask you to help, but, um...

33:31.377 --> 33:33.779
but I dinna want to spoil yer lunch.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.547
Carry on, Mr. Bug.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.053
Roger Mac, come wi' me.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.591
Havena seen the Beardsleys, have ye?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.559
No, why?

33:48.293 --> 33:49.428
Ah, never mind.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.098
Noticed ye didn't
want yer sandwiches either.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.366
Ye're not hungry?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.804
Probably sounds ridiculous to you,

33:59.071 --> 34:01.206
but in the future,
there are some who are opposed

34:01.273 --> 34:03.041
to eatin' animals altogether.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.343
Aye, Claire told me.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.478
Vegetarians.

34:08.180 --> 34:09.782
Ye gonna tell me ye joined their ranks?

34:10.282 --> 34:11.517
No.

34:12.651 --> 34:15.487
I don't know why I struggle so much with
the thought of all that sort of thing,

34:15.554 --> 34:17.089
when we both know that I've...

34:17.689 --> 34:19.158
Killed a man?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.763
God alone is yer judge, Roger Mac.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.432
What I did

34:27.366 --> 34:28.434
to that Brownsville man...

34:29.735 --> 34:31.804
isn't it the same as
what happened to Malva?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.205
No.

34:33.439 --> 34:34.473
But "thou shalt not kill--"

34:34.540 --> 34:36.642
Does no good to
quote "thou shalt not kill."

34:37.543 --> 34:40.179
<i>In Greek and Hebrew scriptures,</i>

34:40.412 --> 34:41.680
the word "murder" is used.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.816
Malva was murdered.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.385
Makes me wonder
where God is in all of this.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.520
And where I stand.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.223
How can I preach to others when--

34:51.290 --> 34:53.258
I can see that ye
want to take care of them,

34:53.759 --> 34:54.860
the folk here.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.261
It's the last thing I thought of,

34:56.328 --> 34:57.763
growin' up in a minister's house.

34:59.498 --> 35:02.334
It's the burying and christening and...

35:04.336 --> 35:05.704
Maybe just bein' able to help.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.774
Even by listening and prayin'.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.245
I don't think there's a minister coming.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.315
Someone has to do it.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.485
I'm thinkin' it's me.

35:21.854 --> 35:24.122
I have eyes to see it, lad.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.426
I'd have to see about gettin' ordained.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.396
There might be
a way to do it quickly, but...

35:32.130 --> 35:34.500
you know what's comin'-- the war.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.269
It's already here, in fact.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.837
As a wise man once told me,

35:39.872 --> 35:41.373
there's always a war comin'.

35:42.407 --> 35:44.376
Which is why I haven't told Brianna yet.

35:46.445 --> 35:47.713
Don't want her to think me a coward.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.681
Ye think she would?

35:50.782 --> 35:53.418
I've fought alongside a priest before.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.655
Now, granted,
he wasna much of a swordsman.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.824
I couldn't fight with an army,
I don't think.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.295
But I could take up
arms to defend those in need.

36:04.363 --> 36:05.631
And that is enough for me.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.633
Yer wife...

36:09.835 --> 36:11.370
she has eyes too.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.929
<i>You led Malva
astray with your meddlin'.</i>

36:38.630 --> 36:40.432
<i>Always meddlin'.</i>

36:41.533 --> 36:43.769
<i>You bring pain to everyone around you.</i>

36:46.204 --> 36:47.472
<i>Your daughter,</i>

36:48.240 --> 36:50.842
<i>she got a good taste of
it when she came back here.</i>

36:52.244 --> 36:53.579
<i>To save you.</i>

36:53.645 --> 36:55.647
Stop it.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.283
Just stop it.

36:58.350 --> 37:00.819
<i>Finding herself in a dark room</i>

37:00.886 --> 37:03.522
<i>in the back of
a tavern with a baby in her belly</i>

37:03.589 --> 37:05.624
<i>that she never planned to have.</i>

37:23.609 --> 37:25.744
And look at Lizzie.
She can't even tell you

37:25.811 --> 37:28.447
<i>who the father of her child is.</i>

37:34.386 --> 37:37.389
How are you gonna make that right, Claire?

37:46.331 --> 37:47.766
<i>Aren't you the clever one,</i>

37:47.833 --> 37:49.534
<i>Dr. Rawlings...</i>

37:49.601 --> 37:51.303
<i>Mrs. Beauchamp, Madam Fraser.</i>

37:51.436 --> 37:53.872
<i>Claire. Beautiful lies.</i>

37:53.939 --> 37:55.974
<i>I believe
that you have secrets, Claire.</i>

37:56.041 --> 37:57.676
<i>Now you're gonna be in an abyss.</i>

37:57.743 --> 37:59.511
<i>I smell the vapors of hell.</i>

37:59.578 --> 38:01.446
<i>Dwell in darkness, madam.</i>

38:01.513 --> 38:03.482
<i>Darkness is where I belong.</i>

38:03.548 --> 38:05.550
<i>You've seen men die before.</i>

38:05.617 --> 38:07.719
<i>You can come out now,
Claire--they say I'm a witch.</i>

38:07.786 --> 38:09.488
- <i>Witch.</i>
- <i>We know what happens</i>

38:09.554 --> 38:11.023
<i>- to witches, don't we, Malva?</i>
- <i>If I had a lady</i>

38:11.289 --> 38:12.691
<i>- to sleep...
- Help with the militia.</i>

38:12.758 --> 38:14.493
<i>Her cold, dark feelings.</i>

38:14.559 --> 38:15.627
<i>...consequences...</i>

38:15.694 --> 38:17.062
<i>More lies.</i>

38:17.329 --> 38:18.664
<i>I will slit her throat, I swear.</i>

38:18.730 --> 38:20.532
<i>Ye havena
told the truth about yerself.</i>

38:20.599 --> 38:22.567
- <i>Your beautiful lies.</i>
- <i>You trespass...</i>

38:22.634 --> 38:25.370
<i>You only have
yourself to blame for this.</i>

38:35.614 --> 38:37.416
We're goin'
to a funeral, Sassenach,

38:37.616 --> 38:38.917
not to stand trial.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.486
You really believe that?

38:41.553 --> 38:43.889
We're going to meet my prospective jurors.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.826
Stand trial in
the court of public opinion.

38:47.893 --> 38:50.529
Well, that's what it is, opinion.

38:50.595 --> 38:53.432
I'll no dignify any rumors wi' a response.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.801
And what is it ye say to the bairns?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.336
"Sticks and stones may break my bones,

38:58.403 --> 39:00.605
- but names'll never hurt me."
- Hmm.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.009
I never did care much
for what people thought.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.511
But this...

39:11.583 --> 39:13.485
Anyone wants to say anythin' to you,

39:13.552 --> 39:15.454
they'll have to say it to me first.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.447
Who among us is not a sinner?

39:43.749 --> 39:47.119
<i>Malva was a daughter, a sister,</i>

39:47.919 --> 39:49.121
<i>and a friend.</i>

39:50.856 --> 39:54.092
<i>She might never have
been called "mother" or "wife,"</i>

39:54.726 --> 39:57.963
but those are not the things
by which to judge someone's worth.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.999
<i>God most certainly does not.</i>

40:02.100 --> 40:04.703
<i>It doesn't matter who we are,</i>

40:06.004 --> 40:07.405
<i>nor what we've done,</i>

40:08.006 --> 40:09.975
or what has been done to us.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.544
God forgives.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.748
<i>Lord, You alone are our judge.</i>

40:17.783 --> 40:21.086
We commend Malva's soul to Your care.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.855
Please stand before we go outside to lay

40:24.589 --> 40:27.192
Malva's body and
that of her baby boy to rest.

40:40.806 --> 40:41.773
<i>No.</i>

40:43.074 --> 40:44.576
Not him.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.159
You put that down!

41:36.494 --> 41:37.729
They're dead...

41:38.763 --> 41:39.664
because of you.

41:39.731 --> 41:40.632
Allan!

41:41.533 --> 41:43.702
May I remind
you that we stand before God.

41:50.709 --> 41:52.010
You bastards.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.646
Ye took my sister from me.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.817
And yet you still get to live yer perfect,

41:58.884 --> 42:01.019
happy little lives,
as if nothing's happened.

43:02.147 --> 43:04.816
Ye'll need to be wed.
The sooner the better.

43:12.691 --> 43:14.726
Which one of them is it to be then, lass?

43:15.927 --> 43:18.163
I--I canna--

43:18.930 --> 43:21.866
I--I dinna want to choose.
I love them both.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.802
It's no a matter of who you love, now.

43:24.269 --> 43:25.637
Ye've a child in yer belly.

43:26.071 --> 43:27.939
<i>Nothing matters but doin' right by it.</i>

43:28.139 --> 43:30.141
<i>Doesna mean painting his mother a whore.</i>

43:30.608 --> 43:32.677
- I'm not a whore.
- <i>I didna say ye were.</i>

43:32.911 --> 43:36.081
But others will when word gets around
what ye've been up to, lass.

43:36.381 --> 43:38.383
Spreadin' yer legs for
two men and wed to neither.

43:38.950 --> 43:40.652
Now wi' a bairn,
and ye canna name its father.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.387
I can name him.

43:43.355 --> 43:45.757
His name will be Beardsley.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.127
<i>Ye dinna understand.</i>

43:49.194 --> 43:52.731
They're one soul

43:52.797 --> 43:54.232
in two bodies.

43:54.299 --> 43:55.967
If ye care about the fate of that soul,

43:56.034 --> 43:58.937
ye'll have those two bodies
standing before me, imminently.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.174
Now, where are they?

44:08.880 --> 44:12.050
Please, Mr. Fraser.
Are we goin' to do it here in the stables?

44:12.117 --> 44:15.320
Christ was born in a manger.
It was good enough for Him.

44:16.187 --> 44:19.157
<i>Since ye canna choose amongst yourselves,</i>

44:19.424 --> 44:22.394
short straw weds her.

44:23.061 --> 44:24.229
- But Mr. Fraser, sir--
- Well, but--

44:24.295 --> 44:25.263
Go on.

44:39.110 --> 44:40.345
Take her hand.

44:49.954 --> 44:52.957
Now, do you swear before these witnesses

44:53.024 --> 44:55.126
ye'll take
Elizabeth Wemyss to be yer wife?

44:55.927 --> 44:57.195
I do.

44:57.796 --> 44:59.431
<i>And do you, ye wee besom,</i>

45:00.231 --> 45:01.900
accept Keziah Beardsley--

45:04.002 --> 45:05.437
You are Keziah?

45:06.371 --> 45:08.339
<i>Ye'll take him to be yer husband?</i>

45:08.406 --> 45:11.042
Aye, I will.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.444
Ye're handfast.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.146
When we find a priest,
it'll be properly blessed.

45:15.213 --> 45:17.282
Until then, ye'll speak to no one of this.

45:17.348 --> 45:18.850
No one must know. You understand me?

45:19.951 --> 45:21.486
Well, that's it?

45:21.753 --> 45:23.021
<i>Aye.</i>

45:24.122 --> 45:26.424
And you, better you leave tomorrow.

45:27.058 --> 45:29.194
<i>Dinna come back until the child is born.</i>

45:45.410 --> 45:47.145
Makes me
so sad some won't believe

45:47.212 --> 45:48.746
Malva's baby is in heaven

45:48.813 --> 45:50.215
because he wasn't baptized.

45:52.350 --> 45:53.351
Do you think he is?

45:54.419 --> 45:56.988
As a father, I'd say I want
to believe it with all my heart.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.492
As a minister, I'm not certain.

46:01.459 --> 46:02.927
But I want to find out.

46:04.429 --> 46:06.898
I'm glad you're more
husband than minister, then.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.336
But what if it's my callin' here, Bree?

46:15.440 --> 46:17.942
What if I want to
make the preachin' official?

46:19.010 --> 46:21.045
I get the same
thrill as I do when I teach,

46:21.112 --> 46:24.415
only I feel it stirrin'
something in my soul.

46:26.151 --> 46:27.785
And you're so good at it.

46:28.419 --> 46:31.422
I get it. I do.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.459
What would that mean for our family?

46:35.093 --> 46:36.427
I suppose that's why I'm asking.

46:37.996 --> 46:40.498
I could at least find out
what it would take to be ordained.

46:41.332 --> 46:43.468
Roger, you were raised by a minister.

46:44.536 --> 46:47.872
We both know what it's like
to have parents constantly on duty,

46:48.339 --> 46:50.308
called away at all hours.

46:51.509 --> 46:55.113
Mama would leave at the drop of a hat
when her patients needed her,

46:55.313 --> 46:57.982
and we really suffered because of it.

46:59.250 --> 47:01.819
Looks like things turned out all right
from where I'm sitting.

47:03.521 --> 47:05.156
I swear to you, Bree,

47:06.157 --> 47:07.592
whatever I'm called to do,

47:08.893 --> 47:12.463
I was called to be
your husband and a father first.

47:13.464 --> 47:16.234
Whatever I do will not
be at the price of my family.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.372
You really want this, don't you?

47:22.106 --> 47:25.410
Just think how amazing it would be
if I could baptize our child myself.

47:27.946 --> 47:30.615
I heard there's a Presbytery in Edenton.

47:35.620 --> 47:40.091
Well, I suppose we have some time

47:40.158 --> 47:41.292
until the baby comes.

47:42.293 --> 47:46.030
Is that a yes?

47:47.532 --> 47:50.401
People crying at
our kitchen table day and night?

47:51.336 --> 47:53.104
What would I even serve them?

47:53.638 --> 47:55.573
I'm not that good at baking.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.911
Oh, and, um, I'm Catholic.

48:01.346 --> 48:05.250
Mm, that last one
throws a spanner in things.

48:05.316 --> 48:08.553
If only my father-in-law
had reminded me at some point.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.188
I knew about the bacon.

48:11.589 --> 48:13.358
But you don't think your flock would mind?

48:13.625 --> 48:15.426
You wouldn't need me to convert?

48:16.227 --> 48:18.029
If they have a problem with it,
they can go to hell.

48:19.998 --> 48:21.099
Sure.

48:21.232 --> 48:24.168
Let's just hope
that you have a more diplomatic line

48:24.302 --> 48:26.271
ready when the time comes.

48:27.238 --> 48:31.309
We'll start packing
tomorrow and leave soon as we can.

48:44.022 --> 48:46.658
<i>Going to go get a cup of tea.</i>

48:49.060 --> 48:50.228
What?

48:52.096 --> 48:54.432
Cup of tea makes
everything right with the world.

48:54.932 --> 48:58.536
A truth acknowledged by every English
person that's ever lived.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.439
Thank the Lord I'm Scottish.

49:21.092 --> 49:22.126
Morning.

49:32.370 --> 49:34.739
Why do I get
the feeling that you're avoiding me,

49:35.006 --> 49:36.207
Mrs. Beardsley?

49:38.209 --> 49:40.378
Does Josiah really have to go away?

49:42.313 --> 49:44.582
Mr. Fraser has made his decision.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.685
What with everything
that's going on on the Ridge--

49:48.219 --> 49:49.220
I'm sorry.

49:50.188 --> 49:51.723
I was going to tell ye.

49:52.690 --> 49:54.459
The day Malva died.

49:54.726 --> 49:57.729
I knocked at the door, but it was locked.

50:02.433 --> 50:04.302
You knocked at the door?

50:04.369 --> 50:06.371
Banged and banged.

50:07.105 --> 50:09.240
And you're sure it was that morning?

50:11.209 --> 50:12.477
Aye.

50:14.045 --> 50:16.314
Did I do somethin' wrong, Mistress?

50:17.382 --> 50:18.282
No.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.318
I'm very glad you told me.

51:05.062 --> 51:05.830
No.

51:08.466 --> 51:10.301
But I didn't do it.

51:10.368 --> 51:13.204
<i>That doesn't change a damn thing.</i>

51:13.438 --> 51:15.373
You think you can get rid of me?

51:16.474 --> 51:19.277
<i>- This is not over, Claire.</i>
- No.

51:19.444 --> 51:21.712
The girl may not have died by your hand,

51:22.146 --> 51:24.515
<i>but you led her to her grave.</i>

51:24.849 --> 51:27.318
<i>Sure as the sun rises.</i>

51:27.385 --> 51:28.553
<i>I didn't do it. I didn't do it.</i>

51:28.619 --> 51:31.456
<i>- I didn't do it.</i>
- <i>"I didn't do it."</i>

51:31.522 --> 51:33.658
<i>That doesn't absolve you of your guilt.</i>

51:33.724 --> 51:35.526
<i>Not for this.</i>

51:35.593 --> 51:37.328
<i>Not for any of it.</i>

51:45.203 --> 51:46.437
<i>Sassenach?</i>

51:50.274 --> 51:51.742
What is it?

52:01.652 --> 52:02.854
No, don't.

52:28.212 --> 52:30.548
You won't believe me.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.855
It feels like I'm going crazy.

52:43.528 --> 52:47.732
For the first time in my life,
I--I don't recognize myself.

52:50.334 --> 52:51.302
There's a...

52:53.738 --> 52:56.374
there's a part of me, a...

52:58.276 --> 52:59.577
darkness.

53:01.579 --> 53:03.948
I can't bear for you to see me like this.

53:09.754 --> 53:11.756
I didn't kill Malva.

53:14.592 --> 53:16.794
But what if--

53:18.362 --> 53:20.364
what if I would've had?

53:20.698 --> 53:21.799
For us?

53:25.503 --> 53:26.704
Ye didna.

53:27.305 --> 53:28.372
No.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.809
But what if a part of me

53:31.876 --> 53:33.244
wanted to?

53:36.714 --> 53:39.984
We all have
a darkness inside us, Sassenach.

53:40.484 --> 53:42.887
But I--I feel like

53:44.288 --> 53:47.558
this is possessing me.

53:49.660 --> 53:51.596
<i>It's eating away at me.</i>

53:52.496 --> 53:53.998
I hear voices.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.436
<i>Lionel Brown.</i>

53:58.502 --> 53:59.937
And I see him.

54:02.506 --> 54:06.277
And he's--he's taunting me.

54:07.278 --> 54:11.449
And--and the only
thing that drowns him out is...

54:16.253 --> 54:17.788
...taking Ether.

54:19.890 --> 54:23.294
I've tried for so long just...

54:23.894 --> 54:25.796
to compartmentalize everything.

54:25.863 --> 54:28.799
It's--it's been the only way that I've--

54:28.866 --> 54:31.369
I've known how to cope.

54:31.435 --> 54:35.806
And you just, you put
things in--in neat little boxes.

54:35.873 --> 54:39.610
There's--there's Frank,
and my patients, and--and grief,

54:39.677 --> 54:42.580
and the past, the present,

54:42.647 --> 54:44.281
you.

54:45.449 --> 54:49.520
<i>But now, it's like
the floodgates have just opened.</i>

54:49.587 --> 54:53.324
<i>And--and it's not just Malva,</i>

54:53.391 --> 54:55.393
it's--it's all of it.

54:55.926 --> 54:57.962
It's my fault.

54:58.696 --> 55:02.933
Because... I changed things.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.570
<i>Brianna's attack and--</i>

55:06.637 --> 55:09.974
and--and Roger being sold into slavery,

55:10.041 --> 55:12.643
<i>everything since--</i>

55:12.710 --> 55:15.079
<i>since I first came to this time,</i>

55:15.880 --> 55:18.616
and it's all because

55:18.683 --> 55:20.651
of my selfishness.

55:26.524 --> 55:29.894
Because I desperately
wanted to be with you.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.968
Ye think Bree feels that way?

55:39.003 --> 55:40.771
She wouldna've been born.

55:41.072 --> 55:42.940
What about Roger?

55:43.674 --> 55:45.376
Your selfishness has given him

55:45.443 --> 55:47.578
a wife and a son.

55:48.913 --> 55:52.083
If we hadna gone to France, found Fergus,
he wouldna have Marsali.

55:52.883 --> 55:55.553
So although there is pain,

55:55.619 --> 55:59.056
your selfishness has
brought so much to so many.

55:59.890 --> 56:02.026
Without you,

56:02.093 --> 56:05.463
our whole world crumbles into dust.

56:09.900 --> 56:11.802
But what if I--

56:11.869 --> 56:14.505
what if I can't make this voice stop?

56:14.772 --> 56:17.041
Not without the Ether?

56:18.509 --> 56:21.912
What if there's no magic
words that are gonna make it right?

56:22.980 --> 56:26.050
And I feel like I'll never get better.

56:27.818 --> 56:28.986
After Wentworth,

56:30.154 --> 56:31.555
you found me.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.858
In the dark.

56:33.924 --> 56:35.860
I let you into my mind,

56:35.926 --> 56:37.795
into my soul.

56:39.130 --> 56:40.765
Let me do the same.

56:41.632 --> 56:43.601
Dinna lock me out.

56:43.667 --> 56:44.902
Let me join you.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.672
I canna do that when you--

56:48.939 --> 56:50.841
when ye put yerself to sleep.

56:51.008 --> 56:52.910
We have to face this together.

56:54.044 --> 56:55.446
Claire,

56:56.547 --> 56:59.150
dinna sentence yerself to crimes that

56:59.416 --> 57:01.519
no one is chargin' ye with.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.654
If you're selfish,

57:04.088 --> 57:06.056
let me be accused of the same crime.

57:07.424 --> 57:09.026
And I dinna care what
the right or wrong of it may be,

57:09.093 --> 57:12.563
so long as you are here wi' me.

57:13.798 --> 57:17.935
If it's a sin that you chose me,
then I will go to the devil himself

57:18.202 --> 57:20.171
and bless him for temptin' you to it.

57:20.504 --> 57:22.473
I would.

57:25.509 --> 57:27.478
I'd do it all again,

57:27.545 --> 57:29.079
and more,

57:29.980 --> 57:31.482
to be with you.

58:03.514 --> 58:05.082
<i>You want me to do what?</i>

58:05.883 --> 58:07.251
You want me to marry you?

58:09.820 --> 58:11.722
You want me to marry you now?

58:12.489 --> 58:14.992
Um...to who?

58:15.626 --> 58:17.761
It's me and Jo.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.897
If you'd be so kind.

58:19.964 --> 58:21.866
Kezzie's come to be witness.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.269
Ye don't want a priest to do it?

58:26.837 --> 58:29.740
Lizzie, are you in trouble?

58:31.008 --> 58:33.244
I'm with child.

58:33.811 --> 58:35.012
Aye.

58:35.713 --> 58:39.049
We want to be
married before the babe comes.

58:39.116 --> 58:41.285
But it may be a while
before we find a priest.

58:41.552 --> 58:43.020
Oh, my God, Lizzie.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.189
Are you happy?

58:47.524 --> 58:49.526
We love each other so very much.

58:50.661 --> 58:51.862
Please.

58:51.929 --> 58:54.064
We want to do right by each other.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.733
<i>The Frasers told us</i>

58:55.799 --> 58:58.269
<i>ye were leavin' for
Edenton in the mornin'.</i>

58:58.636 --> 59:00.905
Go on. Do it for them.

59:02.072 --> 59:02.940
Please.

59:06.777 --> 59:10.047
It won't be a marriage exactly.

59:11.048 --> 59:13.751
But you can be handfast, I suppose.

59:13.817 --> 59:15.085
Thank you, Mr. MacKenzie.

59:15.152 --> 59:16.987
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

59:17.221 --> 59:18.589
Just let me put my britches on.

59:18.656 --> 59:21.058
I'm not conducting my
first weddin' bare-arsed.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.696
Lizzie!

59:30.701 --> 59:32.069
Hey, Jemmy.

59:34.638 --> 59:37.608
I didn't have a chance to give this to
Lizzie when she and Josiah were handfast.

59:37.841 --> 59:39.176
Can you give it to her for me?

59:39.243 --> 59:41.145
Just a little something as a wedding gift.

59:41.211 --> 59:43.647
Josiah? What do you mean?

59:43.781 --> 59:46.583
Roger married them last night.
Wait, she didn't she tell you?

59:46.650 --> 59:47.718
What?

59:48.085 --> 59:51.188
Well, Jamie handfasted
Lizzie and Kezzie the other day.

59:52.056 --> 59:53.324
<i>Did you really?</i>

59:53.891 --> 59:55.626
God help me, I did.

59:56.927 --> 59:58.929
But if she's handfast with Kezzie too,

59:59.096 --> 1:00:02.366
- I suppose it isn't exactly valid as such.
- Ready?

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:04.935
It's certainly as valid
as the handfasting I did.

1:00:05.636 --> 1:00:06.837
I'll have a word wi' them.

1:00:07.137 --> 1:00:09.206
All three of them, I swear.

1:00:09.273 --> 1:00:11.008
God help 'em.

1:00:11.709 --> 1:00:14.778
It's an unholy trinity, certainly.

1:00:15.346 --> 1:00:18.115
<i>What can I say?
The Lord works in mysterious ways.</i>

1:00:29.159 --> 1:00:30.361
I'll tell them

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.296
that marriage is a serious undertaking.

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:35.766
Requires patience, sacrifice...

1:00:36.100 --> 1:00:38.769
Monogamy. Maybe
they should've started with that.

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:41.805
Hmm. Aye.

1:00:42.339 --> 1:00:45.642
It was Kezzie first,
and Kezzie she'll stay wed to.

1:00:46.210 --> 1:00:48.278
That's all that anyone
on the Ridge needs to know.

1:01:36.927 --> 1:01:38.262
Mr. Fraser,

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:40.864
<i>we've come for your wife.</i>

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:46.737
Well,

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:49.273
ye can be on yer way then.

1:01:49.907 --> 1:01:52.042
Now, see there, you're wrong.

1:01:52.342 --> 1:01:54.311
<i>We've come to arrest her</i>

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:56.480
for the murder of Malva Christie.
