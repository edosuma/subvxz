STEFAN: Julian took over our town.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.682
Well, I suppose
it wasn't so much of a takeover

00:09.920 --> 00:11.763
as a, "Walk right in,
nobody's stopping you."

00:11.960 --> 00:13.769
Alaric's babies
are the future of the coven.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.604
They're inside of you.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.161
I'm done, Mary Lou. It's over.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.364
I found this in my mail.
It's a warning. From the Huntress.

00:21.520 --> 00:24.126
Once you've been marked by her sword,
she never stops hunting you.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.170
- There's no stopping her, ever.
-If my friends' lives are in danger,

00:27.360 --> 00:28.771
I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.602
STEFAN: You came out of the Phoenix Stone

00:31.800 --> 00:33.290
but you thought
you were still inside of it.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.285
Hell messes with you, but post-hell...

00:36.440 --> 00:37.487

00:37.680 --> 00:40.365
-...is much worse.
- Can't you find someone else to haunt?

00:40.560 --> 00:44.485
- I can't leave until you find liberation.
- I'm not doing this with you anymore.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.281
- I promised you liberation.
- No.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.844
Mind giving me a hand?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.331
- What're you doing out here?
-(SIGHS) I don't know.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.847
- I thought it would make me feel better.
- Okay.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.004
Should I call someone or...

01:27.320 --> 01:29.322
- What's your name?
- It's Cooper.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.083
Cooper, you ever done something
so unspeakably horrific

01:34.280 --> 01:36.009
you couldn't even look at yourself
in the mirror?

01:36.240 --> 01:39.528
Like it literally makes you ill
to see your own reflection?

01:40.560 --> 01:41.846
Be honest, now.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.366
I ran over my girlfriend's cat
a couple months ago and didn't tell her,

01:45.520 --> 01:46.760
even though it was an accident.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.610
I threw the body
in a supermarket dumpster.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.287
I killed the love of my life,
burned her alive while she was asleep.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.891
I also beat one of her best friends

01:54.040 --> 01:55.530
until he was unconscious
and left him for dead,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.125

02:03.080 --> 02:04.923
Actually, I could use a ride.

02:09.039 --> 02:11.042
I thought Elena had changed me.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.329
I thought she made me a better man,
but I was wrong,

02:14.800 --> 02:16.086
I was so wrong.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.482
It was always gonna end up this way.
Me destroying her.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.768
That's what my whole tour of duty
in that Phoenix Stone taught me

02:20.960 --> 02:22.564
is that I am permanently damaged goods.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.730
You ever feel that way, Cooper?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.167
Hmm?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.571
Not really.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.486
Well, you're lucky.
Coop, I'm gonna kill you now.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.724
- Excuse me?
- No, it's nothing personal.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.081
I'm hungry, you're food.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.924
Think of it as a stop
at a drive-thru window.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.003
You know, you'll be afraid, I won't care.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.925

you just made yourself a home here,

- So you are the Huntress.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

25:18.800 --> 25:21.087
I don't think
you can really call me that anymore.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.485
Now I'm just an old woman in a dingy room,
waiting to die.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.762
- How did you end up here?
- I was careless.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.571
The drive to kill...

25:30.200 --> 25:32.407
The drive instilled upon me
by the shamans,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.728
it got a little scrambled in my old age.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.731
I staked a check-out girl
at the supermarket.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.485
My mistake.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.886
Could you help me with the cookie please?

25:49.040 --> 25:50.087
(GRUNTING)

25:51.120 --> 25:52.610
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

25:52.920 --> 25:55.321
I'm afraid your magic won't work on me.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.527
Now untie my hands
before I crush your windpipe to dust.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.282
Hey, you all right?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.450
I'm fine. What are you doing here?

26:12.600 --> 26:14.329
(SIGHS) It's a long story, love.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.601
Let's just say for today
that I'm your guardian angel.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.687

26:33.400 --> 26:34.481
Yeah!

26:34.960 --> 26:36.689
- Whoo.
- See, I never had a brother.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.008
- No siblings at all, actually.
- Whoo.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.930
It seems I dodged a bullet there.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.006
(BOTH GRUNTING)

26:46.760 --> 26:49.809
Well, that makes sense.
You were a lonely little tadpole.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.327
And that's why
you need to surround yourself

26:52.480 --> 26:55.404
with low-life degenerate bloodsuckers
like these.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.121
(BOTH GRUNTING)

27:03.640 --> 27:05.290
At least I have friends.

27:08.280 --> 27:12.001
You've driven away every last soul
who ever cared for you.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.847
I guess I'll just have to cuddle up
next to the fire with all my rage.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.731

27:31.760 --> 27:34.445
You're not really looking
for your brother, are you?

27:34.960 --> 27:37.042
I mean, even if Stefan did come back,

27:38.040 --> 27:40.930
what do you think he would do
when he found out what you did to Elena?

27:41.080 --> 27:42.127
Go ahead.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.406
Rip my heart out.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.050
You know it's not
that I wouldn't love to do it,

27:49.760 --> 27:52.047
but are you sure?

27:54.760 --> 27:55.921
Do it.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.605
(ALL CHEERING)

28:05.640 --> 28:06.687
(GROANING)

28:19.920 --> 28:23.402
Listen to me, if you let Julian
rip your heart out, I will kill him.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.604
And every single person here
will instantly rip my head off.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.081
But you don't care, do you?

28:28.240 --> 28:30.402
Your life doesn't matter
and neither does mine, does it?

28:37.120 --> 28:38.770
Come on, brother.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.567
Come on.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.247
(GRUNTING)

29:05.960 --> 29:08.122
If they come back, kill them!

29:11.440 --> 29:13.920
Where have you been?
You just fell off the face of the earth.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.242
You missed me. That warms my heart.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.125
I didn't miss you.
I'm curious as to your recent whereabouts.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.601
- There's a difference.
- What, Matt didn't tell you?

29:22.040 --> 29:23.724
I thought he'd be crowing all over town

29:23.920 --> 29:27.481
how he called in some shadowy organization
to hunt me down and cage me up.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.041
Matt did that?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.163
It didn't turn out the way
he'd expected, guarantee you that.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.131
Now look, we've got to get this body
out of here before someone notices.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.527
So a bit of cloaking
would probably be helpful.

29:37.880 --> 29:39.450
NORA: Are you all right?
BONNIE: I'm fine.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.325
Considering I was almost strangled
to death by an 80-year-old psychopath.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.403
Did you know the Huntress
was immune to magic?

29:44.560 --> 29:46.130
I had no idea, I swear.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.488
That lying little weasel.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.003
Hey. Where are you going?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.322
Nowhere in particular.
I don't have a destination.

29:58.520 --> 30:02.241
So you don't have anything to say about
what happened back there, huh? Huh?

30:05.520 --> 30:06.965
You're right, Stefan.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.842
Giving Julian the satisfaction
of ripping my heart out

30:10.000 --> 30:11.331
would have been a mistake.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.324
Thanks for the intervention.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.771
- That's it?
- That's it.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.210
You're just gonna walk away.
You're gonna flip your switch.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.211
Flip my switch?
I'm not gonna flip my switch, Stefan.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.771
I want to feel pain.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.446
I want to feel every miserable moment
of this miserable life.

30:27.640 --> 30:30.041
What is this about? What did you do?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.361
I killed her.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.007
I killed Elena.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.409
- What do you mean you killed Elena?
- It was all Henry's idea.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.565
Told me I needed to free my true self.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.246
So, I kidnapped Tyler
and made him take me to her coffin.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.404
And then I burned her to ashes.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.206
So go ahead. Stand by me.

31:02.880 --> 31:07.283
Tell me you'll never walk away.
Go ahead, Stefan. Come on. Do it. Do it!

32:03.520 --> 32:05.409
We should probably
get back to the hospital.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.961
Should I drive?

32:08.400 --> 32:11.449
I'd hate to think we survived all that
just to have you kill us both on the road.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.840
I'm fine.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.170
You don't seem fine.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.851
This is all Julian's fault.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.211
Took Lily away from me
when I was too young to lose a mother.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.690
He hurt you, he killed our child,
he destroyed Damon.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.687
He has my home. He has my town.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.284
And what do I do?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.006
I let him live.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.007
He's strong and well-protected.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.242
There's revenge,
and then there's stupidity.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.046
Damon might not understand the difference,
but you're smarter.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.441
I don't wanna be the smart one anymore.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.171
I want him dead.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.681

33:13.520 --> 33:15.045
If you're about to say
"Penny for your thoughts,"

33:15.240 --> 33:17.527
- I'm gonna punch you in the face.
- I wasn't.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.325
Pretty sure I already know
what you're thinking.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.046
I'm processing.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.286
Just give me a minute.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.681
So vampires are a thing.

33:27.960 --> 33:34.081
And Mystic Falls has always had vampires,
but now it's been completely overrun.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.126
- Anything else I should know about?
- I think that's enough for one night.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.447
So that's what the weapons
in your truck were for?

33:43.560 --> 33:46.086
Fighting vampires? Are you crazy?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.922
- What are you still doing in this place?
- I don't talk to my parents.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.040
My sister's dead.
This town is only constant I have.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.249
Besides, once you know
the supernatural's real,

33:58.640 --> 33:59.926
there's really nowhere to hide.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.241
Might as well just take a stand, right?

34:03.960 --> 34:05.007

34:07.440 --> 34:11.650
You are 100% not who I thought you were.

- Maybe a little damaged, in a sweet way.

by now.

I just

34:42.280 --> 34:44.726
wanted to say thank you for today.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.210
We still make a good team,
don't you think?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.569
Well, Rama's dead. Julian's safe.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.324
You'll surely sleep easy tonight.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.647
- Do you like her?
- Bonnie?

35:02.200 --> 35:05.488
And what if I did?
She's beautiful, smart and loyal.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.167
And you appear to be
only two of those things.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.881
I'm sorry I chose Julian.

35:13.280 --> 35:17.569
If I could take it back,
I would choose you, every time.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.924
I love you, Nora.

really good,

just a little bit of self-control,
