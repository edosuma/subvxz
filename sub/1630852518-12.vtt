00:26.985 --> 00:30.447
-
-98, 99, 100!

00:30.530 --> 00:32.782
Ready or not, here I come!

00:32.866 --> 00:33.992


00:34.075 --> 00:35.452


00:35.535 --> 00:37.495
Um, I found…

00:37.579 --> 00:38.830
all of you.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.541
And we found this hilarious video.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.918


00:44.002 --> 00:47.130
Uh, my dog is way funnier than that.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.215
Then get him
his own Snoob-Tube channel.

00:49.299 --> 00:53.052
If you get 1,000 followers,
you can earn serious money.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.262
Serious-wha?

00:54.345 --> 00:57.974
Yeah, Snoob-Tube sends the money
right to your phone.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.142
How much money?

00:59.225 --> 01:04.147
Let's just say this dog's channel
has 1,000 followers, and… that.

01:10.236 --> 01:14.074
The Dukey Channel needs 1,000 followers,
so, smart sisters, help.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.701
Why is Dukey dressed up like Robin Hood?

01:16.785 --> 01:18.328
What… what is that?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.038
Uh, Robin Hood?

01:20.121 --> 01:24.793
It's always been my dream
to play the greatest hero of all time.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.503
And hark, my Merry Men,

01:27.128 --> 01:30.548
let us steal from the poor
and give to the rich!

01:32.008 --> 01:33.593
It's the other way around…

01:33.676 --> 01:34.636
Oh.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.888
…and it's the 21st century.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.849
Why not focus on creating
better job opportunities

01:39.933 --> 01:42.101
so the Merry Men don't have to steal?

01:42.977 --> 01:46.314
I'm gonna need a big show open,
and a catchy theme song, too.

01:46.397 --> 01:48.817
Well, we're too busy…

01:48.900 --> 01:51.903
Revolutionizing school travel
so we never have to ride

01:51.986 --> 01:55.115
in a loud and smelly yellow bus again.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.826
But what-eth you say, good sisters,

01:57.909 --> 02:00.870
if instead we could take you
to school-eth in a limo-eth?

02:01.746 --> 02:02.914
Come again-eth?

02:03.748 --> 02:08.044
If you help us get 1,000 followers,
we also get… that.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.342
OK, we're in.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.386
Now roll camera!

02:19.597 --> 02:22.851
The Sheriff of Nottingham
has taken the Maid Marian,

02:22.934 --> 02:25.019
and I must save her!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.647
Again, get with it, Dog.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.650
Maid Marian can save herself,
thank you very much.

02:30.733 --> 02:31.943
Come on.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.987
It's my dream to play Robin--

02:44.789 --> 02:47.333
Yes! The Dukey Channel's
got a hundred followers!

02:47.417 --> 02:51.129
Well, it was obviously my performance.
Heh-heh.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.840
No. It's mirror neurons.

02:53.923 --> 02:58.177
They fire whenever we see someone online
smashing or bashing into something.

02:58.261 --> 03:02.599
And the relief we feel that it's not us
becomes laughter and likes.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.810
So to get the Dukey Channel
1,000 followers,

03:05.894 --> 03:09.105
the Dukey videos
need to be more… painful?

03:09.188 --> 03:10.523
Exactly.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.859
I'll think about it.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.656
Roll camera!

03:18.740 --> 03:21.743
<i>-Woof woof woof!</i> Hey!

03:21.826 --> 03:24.203
-Heh-heh.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.206
Heh-heh. Heh-heh.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.933
Wait, 901? That's it?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.352
And that's it for me, too.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.896
The Internet is fickle, Johnny.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.606
But we were so close.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.359
Which means we just need
to shoot something with Dukey

03:54.442 --> 03:56.653
they've never seen before!

03:57.278 --> 04:00.240
Forget it.
No more Dukey Channel videos.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.368
We just need 99 more followers!

04:04.827 --> 04:08.248
What if we got a camera crew
and real actors?

04:08.331 --> 04:11.376
And you could be Robin Hood?

04:12.168 --> 04:14.629
Well, it has always been my dream.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.881
As long as you don't mind it
being adventurous

04:16.965 --> 04:18.508
and socially conscious.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.011
What about the big show open
and catchy theme song?

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
We can make it as big as you want.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.062
So…? What d'ya say?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.356
I'll think about it.

04:43.741 --> 04:46.577
Wait, I said I'd "think" about it.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.416
Can I have some coffee first?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.587
-Boulders?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.134
You mean like--

05:04.887 --> 05:08.516


05:10.810 --> 05:12.729
Roll it!

05:17.942 --> 05:19.152
I can't believe it.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.029
I'm Robin Hood!

05:21.112 --> 05:23.823
Dukey Hood, there you are.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.868
Correction, Dukey Hood.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

05:26.951 --> 05:30.580
We have returned
from another successful robbery.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.083
Two dirty socks,
a half-eaten carrot,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.501
and three buttons?

05:35.585 --> 05:41.466
Uh, did you not say to steal
from the poor to give to the rich?

05:41.549 --> 05:43.676
Maybe. But it's the other way around.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.261
Oh…

05:45.344 --> 05:47.388
Um, sorry, Phil.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.101
Here. Have some gruel for your troubles.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.812
Why not?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.692
This is the worst gruel ever!

05:59.776 --> 06:01.152
OK, forget the stealing.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.863
Let's focus on creating
new job opportunities

06:03.946 --> 06:07.241
so everyone can live
the Sherwood Forest dream.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.118
Uh…

06:09.202 --> 06:10.328
Dukey Hood!

06:10.411 --> 06:14.791
The Sheriff of Nottingham
has captured the fair Maid Marian!

06:14.874 --> 06:16.125
Yes!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.503
I mean… No!

06:18.586 --> 06:21.130
I must rescue my lady.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.926
But yes! Cos I get to do… this!

06:26.135 --> 06:30.932
It's going to be dangerous,
but I, the hero, can rescue her.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.183
Cover me, Friar Tuck!

06:32.266 --> 06:33.601
-Uh, wha…?

06:34.977 --> 06:36.020
'Sup?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.605
Wait, what's going on?

06:37.688 --> 06:40.775
You're not supposed to be out here.
You got captured!

06:40.858 --> 06:43.361
Yeah, and I just escaped.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.863
But I'm supposed to save you.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.991
Um, I can save myself,
thank you very much?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.451
But that's not the story.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.203
I'm the hero! Dukey Hood?

06:52.286 --> 06:53.871
It's my dream.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.791
Ugh! Fine.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.671
Hey! I escaped
but had second thoughts!

07:02.213 --> 07:03.131
OK.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.719
OK, she's recaptured.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
<i>Now</i> cover me.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.098
Foul-doers!

07:12.181 --> 07:13.891
It is I, Dukey Hood!

07:13.975 --> 07:15.184
Release the fair maiden, or--

07:16.310 --> 07:19.313
The Sheriff has renounced all violence

07:19.397 --> 07:23.109
and welcomes you
to a peaceful negotiation.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.278
That's not the story!

07:25.361 --> 07:29.031
I rescue her,
and you try and stop me!

07:29.115 --> 07:30.324
OK.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.411
Thanks.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.958
Heroes swing on vines.

07:50.261 --> 07:54.432
Once I get to the drawbridge,
I'll throw myself over the wall

07:54.515 --> 07:56.184
and rescue the fair…

07:56.267 --> 07:57.852
maiden!

08:00.396 --> 08:03.191
He tried the arrow-rope thing,
but he was too heavy.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.403
I feel it my duty
to discourage this, m'lord.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.448
Well, don't, and just pull m'cord.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.451
Oh yeah, this one's gonna--

08:18.539 --> 08:19.874
I like him. He's silly.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.462
You missed.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.840
You did it. You freed me!

08:27.924 --> 08:29.217
No, I didn't.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.095
I know, cos I can do it myself.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.599
But I'm the hero!

08:36.682 --> 08:39.185
Maybe you could be a hero
of something else?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.436
Stay out of this.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.648
Just let me go back and get some
of my Merry Men-- Merry People--

08:43.731 --> 08:45.274
and I'll rescue you.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.318
I promise.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.243
Merry People!
I have returned for your--

08:55.326 --> 08:56.577
-Aah!

08:56.661 --> 08:57.745
What's going on?

08:57.828 --> 09:00.998
Creating new jobs, like you said.

09:01.082 --> 09:05.002
I have started my own
advertising company, I have.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.006
Oh.
And what's that smell?

09:09.090 --> 09:12.343
Muck's New Gruel-accino stand.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.559
That's good gruel!

09:19.642 --> 09:22.895
I shall spread word
throughout the kingdom!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.190
Oh, Dukey Hood,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.777
never has a hero
brought such jobs and hope

09:29.860 --> 09:31.529
to Sherwood Forest.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.532
-Did you say "hero"?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.411
And where is that music coming from?

09:38.494 --> 09:41.080
Phil the peasant invented
the Phil-harmonic!

09:44.750 --> 09:46.752
He's booked five gigs!

09:46.836 --> 09:50.965
Well, then.
Let us pick up the pace and celebrate!

09:51.048 --> 09:53.342
-Hurray!
-I believed in you, Phil!

09:53.426 --> 09:55.720
-Always! Huzzah!
-Jolly good!

09:55.803 --> 09:59.015
I'm a socially conscious hero.
Heh-heh-heh-heh.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.728
I don't think he's coming back.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.313
Yeah, I'm outta here.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.066
Wait for me!

10:13.738 --> 10:15.489
We did it!

10:15.573 --> 10:18.993
Ha! I told you they would love me
as Robin Hood.

10:19.076 --> 10:20.411
What are you talking about?

10:20.494 --> 10:23.456
I created jobs in Sherwood Forest,
and you were right,

10:23.539 --> 10:25.833
Maid Marian did not need saving.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.044
No…

10:28.127 --> 10:31.130
You passed out after the truck
dumped bacon on you.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.923
Then we posted this.

10:36.177 --> 10:40.014
Well, I did always say
playing Robin Hood was my "dream."

10:40.097 --> 10:42.683
But you also got us 1,000 followers,

10:42.767 --> 10:46.604
which means we get paid,
which means it's limo time!

10:52.443 --> 10:55.321
$9.78?

10:55.404 --> 10:59.367
What?!
Then how did bacon-dog get that limo?

11:01.327 --> 11:03.663
Yeah, my dog's not rich.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.749
I'm a limo driver,
but I bring him for rides sometimes.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.960
Oh…

11:11.212 --> 11:14.298
We'll give you $9.78
for a ride around the block.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.261
-Whoo-hoo!
