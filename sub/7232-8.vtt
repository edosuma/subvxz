MUST BE CONDUCTED

00:56.139 --> 00:59.184
IN LABORATORIES,
NOT LAVATORIES."

00:59.267 --> 01:01.519

01:01.603 --> 01:02.645

- YEAH.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.646
- I HAVE NEVER HEARD YOU SAY
"POMATO."

01:03.730 --> 01:05.899
- I SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.568
LIKE, JUST THIS MORNING, I SAID,
"HELLO, SUSAN.

01:08.651 --> 01:09.986
HAVE A POMATO DAY!"

01:10.069 --> 01:11.446
- THAT'S TRUE.
HE DID.

01:11.529 --> 01:13.990
- GENERAL, ABOUT THIS HASTY
LAVATORY RESTRICTION--

01:14.073 --> 01:16.493
- IT'S A DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD
OUT THERE, BOYS,

01:16.576 --> 01:17.744
AND I'M THE ALPHA DOG.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.621
NOW, UNLESS ANYONE'S GOT
ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY,

01:19.704 --> 01:22.165
MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.501
- SIR, PERMISSION TO SHARE SOME
OF MY EARTH STUDIES FINDINGS.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.796
- UGH, THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE
ANOTHER LECTURE ON GROUND SLUGS,

01:27.879 --> 01:28.880
IS IT?

01:28.963 --> 01:30.548
- I GOTTA BE HONEST,
AFTER FOUR HOURS,

01:30.632 --> 01:32.091
YOU STARTED TO LOSE ME.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.511
- YOUR LACK OF ATTENTION DOES
NOT INVALIDATE THE SCIENCE.

01:34.594 --> 01:38.681
HOWEVER, TODAY I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT PUPPIES.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.433
- PUPPIES!
- I LIKE PUPPIES.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.394
- OWNING A PET IS A CRUCIAL PART
OF THE EARTH EXPERIENCE.

01:43.478 --> 01:47.023
THEREFORE, I WOULD LIKE TO
REQUISITION ONE ADORABLE PUPPY.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.942
- NO.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.694
- BUT, GENERAL,
IT'S FOR MY RESEARCH.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.863
- NO.
MEETING ADJOURNED.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.866
- BOO-HOO FOR YOU, SQWEEP.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.577
GUESS NOW YOUR EARTH STUDIES
CAN INCLUDE A LESSON

01:59.661 --> 02:01.037
IN DISAPPOINTMENT.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.956
- DUDE,
THAT'S HARSH.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.082
- MOST UNFORTUNATE.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.626
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA NAME
THE PUPPY?

02:06.709 --> 02:07.627
- OH, SQWEEP,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

02:07.710 --> 02:09.795
- YES.
IT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

02:09.878 --> 02:11.381
ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH,

02:11.464 --> 02:14.717
THE TRADITIONAL FIRST RESPONSE
TO A REQUEST FOR A PET IS "NO."

02:14.801 --> 02:16.636
- COMMENCING PHASE TWO.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.721
- "PERSISTENT PESTERING."

02:20.974 --> 02:23.852
PLEASE,
MAY I HAVE A PUPPY?

02:23.935 --> 02:24.811
- NO.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.813
- PLEASE,
MAY I HAVE A PUPPY?

02:26.896 --> 02:27.897
PLEASE?
A PUPPY.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.983
LET ME HAVE A PUPPY,
PLEASE?

02:30.066 --> 02:30.942
- NO!

02:31.025 --> 02:32.777
- PLEASE LET ME HAVE A PUPPY.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.903
I WANT A PUPPY.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.113
GIVE ME A PUPPY.
GIVE ME A PUPPY.

02:35.196 --> 02:38.950
GIVE ME A PUPPY.
PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY, PUPPY.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.164
- AHH.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.084
- PLEASE,
MAY I HAVE A PUPPY?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.963
- I RESPECT YOUR
STICK-TO-ITIVENESS, SQWEEP,

02:52.046 --> 02:53.339
BUT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THE PET THING

02:53.423 --> 02:56.467
WITH MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS,
WHO I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.553
THEY ALWAYS PROMISE TO TAKE CARE
OF IT,

02:58.636 --> 03:01.055
BUT WHO ENDS UP
ON DOODY DUTY?

03:01.139 --> 03:02.015
ME!

03:02.098 --> 03:03.600
THE ANSWER REMAINS NO.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.896
- [sobbing]

03:07.979 --> 03:09.188
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.316
I'VE INTERROGATED
ENOUGH CRYBABIES

03:11.399 --> 03:14.277
TO KNOW THE REAL THING
FROM A FAKER.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.654
- ISN'T CRYING THE NEXT STEP
IN THE PET-OBTAINING RITUAL?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.865
- NORMALLY, YES,

03:18.948 --> 03:20.742
BUT THIS DECISION
ISN'T EVEN UP TO ME.

03:20.825 --> 03:24.787
REGULATION 242D SAYS,
"NO PETS ON BASE!"

03:24.871 --> 03:25.788
- DON'T YOU WRITE
THE REGULATIONS?

03:25.872 --> 03:28.791
- GEH-UH-OOH.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.169
- [sighs]

03:31.252 --> 03:32.712
- WHATCHA DOIN'?

03:32.795 --> 03:36.966
- TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE FOR
MY EARTH STUDIES, I AM MOPING.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.426
[sighs]

03:38.509 --> 03:41.304
- SO STILL A NO-GO
ON THE PUPPY FRONT, HUH?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.472
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.264
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT PUPPIES?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.975
- WELL, PUPPIES ARE PLAYFUL.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.268
- I'M PLAYFUL.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.604
- PUPPIES ARE ALSO CUDDLY.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.396
- I'M CUDDLY.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.564
- PUPPIES ARE THE JUVENILE STAGE

03:51.648 --> 03:54.400
OF THE CANIS LUPUS FAMILIARIS
LIFE CYCLE.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.155
- I'M CUDDLY.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.824
WAIT A MINUTE.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.743
I COULD BE YOUR PET!

04:03.826 --> 04:07.497

04:08.581 --> 04:09.666
[panting]

04:09.749 --> 04:11.292
- B.O.B.,
YOU MAY HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION

04:11.376 --> 04:13.378
TO MY PUPPY PROJECT PROBLEM.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.671
- [groans]

04:14.754 --> 04:16.505
YOU ARE HOUSEBROKEN, RIGHT?

04:16.589 --> 04:19.257
- GENERAL, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR AUTHENTICITY HERE.

04:23.262 --> 04:24.514
- PLEASE?

04:24.597 --> 04:25.932
- [sighs]

04:26.015 --> 04:27.892
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY I
WILL NOT REGRET THIS, IS THERE?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.853
- [slobbering]

04:30.937 --> 04:31.938
NOPE.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.773
- AHH! AHH! AHH!

04:33.856 --> 04:37.151
- LET US BEGIN BY EXPLORING
THE NORMAL OWNER-PET DYNAMIC.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.072
- WHAT IS IT ABOUT
BEING DOG-SHAPED

04:41.155 --> 04:44.784
THAT MAKES ME WAN TO BITE
MY OWN BUTT?

04:44.867 --> 04:47.370
- PLEASE FOCUS.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.371
READY?

04:48.454 --> 04:50.164
SPEAK, BOY.
SPEAK.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.582
- AHEM

04:51.666 --> 04:53.668
WHEN IN THE COURSE OF HUMAN
EVENTS IT BECOMES NECESSARY

04:53.751 --> 04:55.545
FOR ONE PEOPLE TO DISSOLVE
THE POLITICAL BANDS

04:55.628 --> 04:56.963
WHICH HAVE LINGERED WITH US
FOR--

04:57.046 --> 04:58.298
NO, B.O.B.,
LIKE A DOG.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.799
YOU KNOW,
BARKING AND SUCH.

04:59.882 --> 05:00.800
- OH, RIGHT.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.927

05:03.011 --> 05:04.929

05:10.560 --> 05:12.729
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO RETRIEVE
THE BALL.

05:12.812 --> 05:17.025
- OH.

HERE YA GO.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.486
I MEAN, BARK, BARK.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.323

05:24.407 --> 05:25.658
- REALLY?
OKAY.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.327
gulp!

05:29.454 --> 05:32.582
- B.O.B.,
AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION,

05:32.665 --> 05:35.334
I DETERMINED THAT YOU ARE...
A TERRIBLE DOG.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.754
- IS THAT BECAUSE OF
THE ACCIDENT IN THE HALLWAY?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.756
- B.O.B.!

05:39.839 --> 05:40.590
- THAT WAS THE ONLY THING
YOU DID

05:40.673 --> 05:42.091
THAT ACTUALLY WAS LIKE A DOG.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.970
- RIGHT, 'CAUSE...I WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT OTHERWISE.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.056
- I DON'T THINK THIS STUDY
CAN CONTINUE SUCCESSFULLY

05:48.139 --> 05:50.975
ON ITS CURRENT COURSE.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.102
- WELL, MAYBE I'D HAVE BETTER
LUCK AS A CAT.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.229
MOO.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.399
- I HAVE ONE LAST THING TO TRY:
BLASTING YOU WITH A RAY

05:58.483 --> 06:01.110
THAT WILL GIVE YOU
CANINE BRAINWAVES.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.946
- BUT I DON'T HAVE A...

06:10.203 --> 06:11.245
BRAIN.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.748
- HMM,
AN OBVIOUS OVERSIGHT.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.292
I HOPE THERE WERE NO
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

06:16.375 --> 06:20.004
[both barking]

06:20.088 --> 06:22.381
- [howling]

06:22.465 --> 06:25.635

AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.304
[all barking]

06:29.555 --> 06:31.808

06:44.028 --> 06:47.156
- OKAY, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.159
SUSAN WOULD NEVER CHEW ON A SHOE
BEFORE LUNCH.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.828
- I THINK IT'S TIME
WE INFORM THE...

06:51.911 --> 06:53.579
- [barking]

06:53.663 --> 06:54.705
- GENERAL?

06:54.789 --> 06:56.332

06:56.415 --> 06:57.667
- HE GOT HIT TOO, RIGHT?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.001
- CORRECT.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.587
- 'CAUSE WITH HIM,
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.756
- [barking]

07:03.840 --> 07:06.634
[both scream]

07:08.052 --> 07:11.722
- THIS CHAMBER WILL REVERSE THE
EFFECTS OF THE DOG BRAIN BLAST.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.767
- SWEET.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.061
BUT HOW DO WE GET ALL
THE DOG BRAINS IN THERE?

07:17.145 --> 07:18.354
- THIS IS THE CHALLENGE.

07:18.437 --> 07:22.733
WE WILL NEED TO LURE THEM IN.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.068
- WE COULD USE THIS.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.653
- THAT SHOULD WORK VERY WELL.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.573
JUST ONE QUESTION:
WHY DO YOU HAVE A PORK CHOP?

07:28.656 --> 07:29.740
- WHAT?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.242
YOU DON'T ALWAYS CARRY MEAT
WITH YOU?

08:01.355 --> 08:04.442
- [growling and barking]

08:06.819 --> 08:09.405
- HE IS A VERY ANGRY DOG.

08:09.488 --> 08:10.573
- DON'T WORRY.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.782
I GOT THIS.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.867
OPEN IT.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.746
- [growling]

08:16.829 --> 08:18.706
- ON SECOND THOUGHT,
MAYBE I DON'T.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.333
OOP!

08:21.876 --> 08:24.086
NO, BOY!
THAT'S NOT THE BALL.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.631
THIS IS THE BALL.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.883
- WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.759
- I CAN SEE WHERE HE'S GOING.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.761
HE'S RUNNING DOWN A PINK TUNNEL.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.429
IT'S GOT, LIKE,
A DANGLE-Y THING,

08:34.514 --> 08:35.806
LIKE AT THE BACK OF A THROAT.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.267
- B.O.B., YOU MUST BE
LOOKING DOWN HIS ESOPHAGUS.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.393
TURN AROUND.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.519
- OH, RIGHT.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.567
OKAY,
HE JUST RAN INTO A ROOM.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.487
I SEE WEAPONS,
LOTS AND LOTS OF WEAPONS.

08:49.570 --> 08:54.825
- OH, NO.
HE MUST BE IN THE...ARMORY.

08:58.913 --> 08:59.956
- HEY, HE DROPPED MY EYE.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.749
OH,
NOW HE'S AFTER SOMETHING ELSE.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.336
- [barking]

09:05.419 --> 09:10.508
- LOOKS LIKE...
A GRENADE.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.052
- [gasps]
IF THAT GRENADE GOES OFF,

09:13.135 --> 09:16.347
IT'LL START A CHAIN REACTION
THAT COULD LEVEL THE WHOLE BASE.

09:16.430 --> 09:20.476
- AW, MAN, THEN GENERAL MONGER
WOULD BE REALLY STEAMED.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.979
- ACTUALLY,
GENERAL MONGER WOULD BE--

09:23.062 --> 09:25.398
- OH, RIGHT, STILL A DOG.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.150
B.O.B.,
TRY ACTING LIKE A CAT AGAIN.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.193
- HOW'S THIS?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.486
MOO.

09:30.569 --> 09:33.948
- GOOD,
EXCEPT I BELIEVE IT'S "MEOW."

09:34.031 --> 09:36.158
- IF YOU SAY SO.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.493
MEOW.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.996
MEOW.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.664
OH,
I THINK IT'S WORKING.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.000
MEOW, MEOW.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.167
I'M A CAT.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.294
IT'S TIME WE SHOW THIS NOOB
HOW THE PROFESSIONALS DO IT.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.838
MONSTERS, ATTACK.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.757
- [laughs]

20:16.840 --> 20:17.799
- NOW, DR. C.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.302
- BRACE YOURSELF, BEAST.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.887
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO--
EEP!

20:34.566 --> 20:36.818
- BRAAAAAAAAAINS.

20:36.902 --> 20:37.861
- AHH!

20:37.945 --> 20:38.862
SCARY PART.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.489
SOMEONE PAUSE THE MOVIE.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.950
- [roars]

20:43.033 --> 20:44.534
- HUH?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.745
- YOU ARE NOT GETTING
OUR BRAINS.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.007
- GREETINGS, MONSTERS.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.676
- SQWEEP, YOU SAVED US.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.761
- LAUNCHING THE MOON APE
INTO DEEP SPACE

21:02.844 --> 21:05.597
IS PRECISELY HOW IT WAS DEFEATED
AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.683
YAY, ME.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.267
- MAD PROPS, ALIEN KID.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.852
YOU JUST FACED YOUR FEAR.

21:10.936 --> 21:11.895
- YEAH, YOU DID.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.772
- UP HIGH FOR MUSTACHES.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.403
- SQWEEP, FROM NOW ON,
YOU'VE GOT A LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP

21:19.486 --> 21:20.445
TO MOVIE NIGHT.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
- REALLY?
- YUP.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.907
AND NEXT TIME,
YOU CAN EVEN PICK THE FLICK.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.158
- EXCELLENT.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.493
NOW THAT I AM NO LONGER AFRAID,

21:26.576 --> 21:29.371
I AM MOST EAGER TO WATCH
THE FILM'S MANY SEQUELS:

21:29.454 --> 21:33.250
<i>THE RETURN OF THE ZOMBIE MOON</i>
<i>APE, MOVIES 2 THROUGH 14.</i>

21:33.333 --> 21:35.335
- NO DIBS.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.589
- AND SO IT RETURNED,
JUST AS IT CAME,

21:39.673 --> 21:41.758
NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.846
- [roaring]
