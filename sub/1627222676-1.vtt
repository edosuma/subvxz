01:28.261 --> 01:29.261
Hello, Tom.

01:47.037 --> 01:47.981
What's this for?

01:47.983 --> 01:49.936
I can't Bury him if he ain't dead.

01:52.123 --> 01:53.514
You mean he pulled through?

01:54.770 --> 01:55.770
I'll be damned.

01:56.391 --> 01:58.853
He's not there. The sheriff's office.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.269
I'll be damned.

02:18.324 --> 02:19.324
You're alive.

02:22.074 --> 02:24.232
What in god's name
happened to you out there?

02:25.191 --> 02:28.454
Yankee bullets. Tried to snuff us out.

02:30.494 --> 02:32.550
There ain't no
Yankees around these parts.

02:33.592 --> 02:34.981
How long were you
wandering around out there

02:34.983 --> 02:36.069
all wounded and such?

02:38.533 --> 02:39.780
There ain't not telling.

02:41.501 --> 02:43.794
Yeah, I'm not sure how
long you was laying there

02:43.796 --> 02:45.410
before I stumbled across you.

02:46.827 --> 02:47.827
Luckily I did.

02:48.697 --> 02:50.276
Beat the coyotes and the wolves.

02:52.731 --> 02:54.070
Will you get me out of here?

02:56.590 --> 02:58.765
I guess I could go have
a word with the sheriff,

02:58.767 --> 02:59.767
see what I can do.

03:01.059 --> 03:01.934
First you can to tell me

03:01.936 --> 03:03.780
a little bit about the battle you was in?

03:05.668 --> 03:07.442
Well we had the Yankees on the run.

03:08.603 --> 03:09.706
That's for damned sure.

03:13.315 --> 03:16.632
Hell, they didn't know whether
to scratch their watches

03:16.634 --> 03:19.619
or wind their asses.

03:21.074 --> 03:22.704
Where do you call home, soldier?

03:26.780 --> 03:27.780
San antone.

03:28.622 --> 03:33.417
San Antonio. Woo-wee, you
is a long way from home.

03:35.776 --> 03:37.699
Alright, I'll go see if I
can track down the sheriff

03:37.701 --> 03:39.064
and see if we can get you out of here.

03:39.066 --> 03:41.250
And if I can, I'll give you a coin

03:41.252 --> 03:43.609
and you can hop a train to vicksburg.

03:43.611 --> 03:46.937
From there, you can catch a buckwagon

03:46.939 --> 03:49.052
or a stagecoach on down to Texas.

03:50.181 --> 03:52.049
- Much obliged.
- Yeah.

03:52.051 --> 03:53.631
When you get there, you tell the men

03:53.633 --> 03:55.360
if Jeff Davis wants to win this war,

03:56.434 --> 03:57.799
he's gonna need more texans.

03:59.810 --> 04:00.810
Alright.

04:02.418 --> 04:03.418
Sit tight.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.158
Give me two.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.496
Here you go.

05:15.229 --> 05:16.392
Morning, huck.

05:17.348 --> 05:18.428
What do you say there, Jim?

05:19.161 --> 05:20.986
- I say whiskey.
- Rye?

05:22.105 --> 05:25.004
- Bourbon.
- Spoken like a true irishman.

05:32.572 --> 05:33.572
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.780
- How's you?
- How's you?

05:45.782 --> 05:47.141
A tall whiskey.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.673
Here you go.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.628
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.357
So, you on leave?

06:12.263 --> 06:13.845
I'm on leave from cutting dust.

06:14.679 --> 06:16.217
I meant leave from the army.

06:20.627 --> 06:22.572
There ain't no army for me no more.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.468
Are you a cripple?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.055
I ain't a cripple.

06:31.396 --> 06:33.312
Took a couple of yankee bullets,

06:33.314 --> 06:34.752
busted my leg some years back.

06:37.133 --> 06:41.444
So are you gonna let that stand?

06:41.446 --> 06:42.504
Yankee bullets?

06:44.663 --> 06:47.208
Them boys up north are just
doing what they were told.

06:47.210 --> 06:48.457
It ain't nothing personal.

06:50.771 --> 06:51.568
What the hell?

06:51.570 --> 06:53.130
What the hell is wrong with people?

06:54.182 --> 06:55.216
You just ain't got the stomach for it.

06:55.218 --> 06:56.731
That's what it is.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.187
Let me tell you, old Jeff
Davis and general Lee,

06:59.189 --> 07:01.306
they're gonna need every
able bodied man they can get

07:01.308 --> 07:03.408
if we're gonna pull them off this miracle.

07:03.410 --> 07:04.410
God damn.

07:05.544 --> 07:08.987
If you're so eager to fight,
take a rifle, head east.

07:12.097 --> 07:12.894
You know I would,

07:12.896 --> 07:15.711
except for I got these flat feet,

07:15.713 --> 07:18.271
so they probably wouldn't even let me.

07:18.273 --> 07:20.151
You know what? Don't, don't...

07:20.153 --> 07:21.571
You believe this fella?

07:21.573 --> 07:22.654
He's scared of battle.

07:22.656 --> 07:24.526
I've got no quarrel with you, mister.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.121
But if you think I'm going
to go back and get shot

07:28.123 --> 07:30.415
so a plantation owner
can own more slaves...

07:34.251 --> 07:36.934
Blasphemy. God damned blasphemy.

07:36.936 --> 07:39.258
How dare you talk about
your homeland like that!

07:47.697 --> 07:50.951
Skin it, or else I say we're done here.

07:52.530 --> 07:53.530
Yeah?

07:54.381 --> 07:55.986
Just take it easy, boys.

07:58.275 --> 07:59.136
If you two want to kill one another,

07:59.138 --> 08:01.318
kindly draw a line out in the street.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.894
Sorry, huck.

08:25.466 --> 08:28.373
This damned war's got everyone
on one side or the other.

08:31.429 --> 08:32.429
Appears so.

08:34.086 --> 08:36.577
Not to stoke the fire, but I heard

08:36.578 --> 08:39.775
a man named beauregard
stopped in here last night.

08:41.537 --> 08:42.629
Sounds familiar.

08:42.631 --> 08:45.597
It's arliss beauregard.

08:45.599 --> 08:47.085
He took a room down at the inn.

08:47.963 --> 08:51.409
He says that there are rumors
that Lee might surrender.

08:52.691 --> 08:53.825
- Surrender?
- Yeah.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.464
He says he's down here
recruiting soldiers from Texas.

08:59.634 --> 09:01.552
He's probably looking for funding,

09:01.554 --> 09:02.561
in case Lee bows out.

09:06.031 --> 09:07.760
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You bet.

09:11.335 --> 09:13.519
I'm gonna skin out and lay low.

09:13.521 --> 09:15.202
- See you later.
- Alright, huck.

09:59.546 --> 10:01.161
Buenos noches. Como estas?

10:01.163 --> 10:05.065
Buenos noches, mi amigo.
Estoy bien, gracias.

10:05.067 --> 10:07.398
And I see your Spanish is improving.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
Well, I'm trying.

10:09.158 --> 10:10.993
I don't know how you Mexicans do it.

10:12.167 --> 10:13.833
What can I get you?

10:13.835 --> 10:15.562
One cerveza and a bourbon, please.

10:17.432 --> 10:19.014
Clear off this table over here.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.185
I am parched.

10:35.187 --> 10:36.187
I am too.

10:43.249 --> 10:44.393
Here you go.

10:45.860 --> 10:48.234
One beer, and one bourbon.

10:48.236 --> 10:49.236
Gracias, mi amigo.

10:50.394 --> 10:52.895
Well howdy, miss Marisol.
How are you doing today?

10:52.897 --> 10:53.694
I am well.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.696
Thank you for asking.

10:55.774 --> 10:58.141
So, what brings you to San antone?

10:58.143 --> 11:00.812
Supplies for my ranch,
and medicine for the cows.

11:01.691 --> 11:04.063
You can't get that
sort of thing in laredo?

11:38.058 --> 11:39.058
Evening.

11:39.784 --> 11:42.923
What's a fellow gotta do to get
a decent drink in this town?

11:45.577 --> 11:46.577
What'll it be?

11:47.322 --> 11:48.521
Bourbon, if you please.

11:57.806 --> 12:00.239
Trust you found your
room to your liking?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.260
Fine, thanks.

12:04.259 --> 12:08.397
I'm gonna spend the day
looking for volunteers.

12:08.399 --> 12:11.076
Where might a man looking
for soldiers to enlist

12:11.078 --> 12:14.073
begin such a search in your fine town?

12:15.048 --> 12:16.106
Volunteers?

12:21.790 --> 12:22.790
Why, yes.

12:23.545 --> 12:26.248
Able bodied men looking
to fight the good fight

12:26.250 --> 12:27.250
against the north.

12:28.935 --> 12:30.566
I was not aware of any shortage.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.426
If Lee surrenders,
we're all gonna be needing

12:35.428 --> 12:38.332
to finance a war against the north.

12:38.334 --> 12:41.094
In fact, I'm sweeping
through Texas right now

12:41.096 --> 12:43.391
looking for young men that wish to enlist.

12:45.172 --> 12:46.172
The south.

12:47.112 --> 12:49.927
You know the south has always
been outgunned and outmanned.

12:49.929 --> 12:54.386
Well, we might not be as
industrialized as the north,

12:54.388 --> 12:56.371
but we have spirit.

12:56.373 --> 12:59.119
I'm sorry, I must have missed your name.

13:00.679 --> 13:03.013
Ramiro garza. This
is my daughter Marisol.

13:05.006 --> 13:06.013
Lovely to meet you.

13:11.259 --> 13:14.195
Arliss beauregard at your pleasure.

13:16.034 --> 13:17.787
Finance an army, you say?

13:17.789 --> 13:19.959
Should Lee tuck his tail and run.

13:21.222 --> 13:23.495
Well, let's pray that
it don't come to that.

13:25.237 --> 13:26.735
Well, my daughter and I
will be staying the night,

13:26.737 --> 13:28.758
so let's meet back here tonight

13:28.760 --> 13:31.113
and we'll discuss what you're
looking for in private.

13:32.625 --> 13:33.625
Very well.

13:36.519 --> 13:37.519
Say 10 o'clock?

13:38.878 --> 13:39.878
Until then.

13:40.761 --> 13:42.290
Until then.

13:42.292 --> 13:43.292
Evening, sir.

13:44.639 --> 13:45.639
My lady.

14:02.816 --> 14:03.816
Excuse me.

14:05.184 --> 14:06.247
Evening.

14:06.249 --> 14:07.640
Can you help me find these?

14:15.715 --> 14:17.381
I can get that ready by tomorrow,

14:17.383 --> 14:18.678
first thing in the morning.

14:20.081 --> 14:21.081
Thank you.

14:22.716 --> 14:23.850
That man in the bar,

14:26.005 --> 14:27.005
who was he?

14:27.897 --> 14:30.615
Oh. Something "beauregard."

14:34.637 --> 14:35.637
What'd he want?

14:36.948 --> 14:40.637
He mentioned the war,
and looking for young men.

14:42.856 --> 14:44.350
To enlist?

14:44.352 --> 14:45.352
I think so.

14:47.277 --> 14:49.531
He said something about
Lee and the war ending.

14:52.082 --> 14:53.082
What about you?

14:53.791 --> 14:56.107
What do you think of these
americanos fighting a war?

14:59.046 --> 15:00.059
Hard for me to believe you can use

15:00.061 --> 15:02.410
the words "civil" and
"war" in the same sentence.

15:04.607 --> 15:05.971
The real problem is sin.

15:09.037 --> 15:11.003
Man is always trying to kill one another.

15:13.014 --> 15:15.074
Have you ever heard of the
story of Cain and able?

15:15.076 --> 15:16.275
In the Bible.

15:18.522 --> 15:20.012
We're a fallen people.

15:22.547 --> 15:26.019
"Life, Liberty,"

15:28.659 --> 15:29.933
those words don't hold up much

15:29.935 --> 15:31.757
unless you're willing to work for 'em.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.452
Thomas Jefferson said that, yes?

15:39.449 --> 15:42.549
Yeah, that's right. You're educated.

15:44.464 --> 15:45.464
Of course.

15:47.668 --> 15:49.253
I didn't mean to insult.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.810
It's just you being a Mexican and all,

15:52.812 --> 15:54.460
you sure know a lot about our history.

15:56.241 --> 15:59.912
Those words, how can they not mean them

15:59.914 --> 16:01.833
when American kill each other over them?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.566
They just got a different
way of doing it, that's all.

16:08.193 --> 16:11.202
The south's fortune is tied
up in slave labor, and,

16:14.137 --> 16:16.130
well, they'd rather sacrifice

16:16.132 --> 16:17.871
human lives for personal wealth.

16:19.738 --> 16:21.752
But the north didn't invent slaves either.

16:23.507 --> 16:27.372
The hebrews in Egypt,
los indios, espanoles,

16:30.498 --> 16:31.697
no one's hands are clean.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.008
You know your history, too.

16:37.068 --> 16:39.708
Well, to move forward you've
got to understand the past.

16:44.433 --> 16:47.243
I'll get that list to you the
first thing in the morning.

16:47.245 --> 16:48.636
- Muchas gracias.
- De nada.

16:58.483 --> 16:59.689
What?

16:59.691 --> 17:02.145
Well, gentlemen, the
rooster crows mighty early

17:02.147 --> 17:02.943
this time of the year.

17:02.945 --> 17:04.432
I'm gonna call it a night.

17:05.915 --> 17:06.915
Evening, sir.

17:08.054 --> 17:09.894
Welcome to San Antonio.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.766
- Buenos noches, senor.
- Buenos noches.

17:15.285 --> 17:16.286
He's too old.

17:18.421 --> 17:19.723
Yep.

17:19.726 --> 17:24.461
You know, those blue
belly sons of bitches,

17:24.463 --> 17:28.135
all those damned Yankees
above the Mason-Dixon

17:28.137 --> 17:30.849
have proven to be much more resilient

17:30.851 --> 17:32.273
than we first had thought.

17:33.996 --> 17:37.663
The south needs money, money and guns,

17:38.791 --> 17:42.386
because if we're gonna
preserve our way of life,

17:42.388 --> 17:45.906
it's gotta be a true
all-hands-on-deck approach

17:45.908 --> 17:47.282
for the rest of the war.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.786
So I take it that recruiting
is not going as planned?

17:52.688 --> 17:55.333
Nobody wants to serve Lee.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.977
Rumors swirling about him
waving the white flag,

17:58.979 --> 18:01.241
supply lines diminishing.

18:01.243 --> 18:04.928
Hell, who wants to be on
the losing end of a rifle?

18:06.623 --> 18:11.013
Tell me. What is wrong
with an end to the war, huh?

18:11.015 --> 18:13.886
Brother versus brother is
no way to live out conflict.

18:19.637 --> 18:22.325
That's a curse on our confederacy.

18:27.185 --> 18:31.263
Forgive me. That was
unpleasant and uncalled for.

18:32.728 --> 18:35.387
But my passion equals my resolve.

18:37.525 --> 18:40.168
Then let's talk about
a return on investment.

18:40.170 --> 18:42.479
Once we win the war with the north,

18:42.481 --> 18:46.028
you will be greeted with
ten times your investment.

18:46.030 --> 18:48.665
Gold, labor, taxes, you name it.

18:48.667 --> 18:51.346
You're first money in, first money out.

18:53.678 --> 18:54.544
And how much?

18:54.546 --> 18:57.923
$1,000 a month until Christmas.

18:57.925 --> 19:00.759
$1,000, and what makes you think

19:00.761 --> 19:02.007
I have this kind of money?

19:05.297 --> 19:06.479
Mr. Garza,

19:10.226 --> 19:12.464
when a man like you comes to town,

19:13.756 --> 19:16.266
it behooves someone like me

19:16.268 --> 19:19.532
to do a little looking into his past.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.696
I know all about the ranch in laredo,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.659
your sugar cane fields,

19:31.066 --> 19:33.433
how profitable you have been

19:33.435 --> 19:36.660
despite the uproars in Mexico.

19:44.103 --> 19:48.658
I'm gonna give you until
morning to consider my proposal.

19:53.527 --> 19:54.966
And if I reject?

19:59.252 --> 20:04.048
That would be very
unwise of you, Mr. Garza.

20:10.569 --> 20:14.403
I do not need until
morning to make my decision.

20:14.405 --> 20:17.280
I will not be bullied
into joining your war.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.103
You find another backer
who will help you spill

20:19.105 --> 20:21.452
the blood of your brothers in the north.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.040
That backer will not be me.

20:27.771 --> 20:31.335
Evening.

20:37.457 --> 20:39.780
Give me about a week, it'll be ready.

20:39.782 --> 20:41.726
All right. Much obliged.

20:41.728 --> 20:42.728
Thank you.

20:47.431 --> 20:49.705
Marisol! Marisol!

20:49.707 --> 20:51.451
Donde estas?

20:51.453 --> 20:53.053
Have you seen my daughter, Marisol garza?

20:53.055 --> 20:54.541
We ain't seen anyone, mister.

20:55.961 --> 20:58.022
Have you seen my
daughter, Marisol garza?

20:59.634 --> 21:00.784
She came by yesterday.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.527
Dropped off a list of medicine.

21:04.916 --> 21:06.304
Is she alright?

21:06.306 --> 21:08.810
I went this morning and
she was not in the hotel.

21:08.812 --> 21:09.970
What about the ladies' store?

21:09.972 --> 21:12.298
I've looked everywhere.
No one has seen her.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.509
You might need to check on that guy

21:13.511 --> 21:15.369
that came through town yesterday,

21:15.371 --> 21:16.683
the one who stayed at the hotel.

21:16.685 --> 21:17.685
Arliss?

21:19.109 --> 21:20.109
In my experience,

21:21.145 --> 21:23.447
men like that come through
town for two reasons.

21:24.329 --> 21:25.329
Which are?

21:26.861 --> 21:27.861
Take a guess.

21:28.693 --> 21:30.033
He approached me with a business offer

21:30.035 --> 21:31.189
to finance his army.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.645
He don't look like no general to me.

21:38.647 --> 21:39.969
The only one I haven't asked is

21:39.971 --> 21:41.585
the cantinero in the saloon.

21:44.171 --> 21:47.713
Huck? He might shed some light on it.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.612
I think you've had
enough there, old timer.

21:51.614 --> 21:52.812
Move it on down the road.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.838
Have you seen my
daughter, Marisol garza?

22:00.840 --> 22:01.840
No!

22:03.726 --> 22:06.151
Senor garza, is everything alright?

22:06.153 --> 22:07.887
You look like you've seen a ghost.

22:07.889 --> 22:10.193
- Marisol is missing.
- Missing?

22:11.562 --> 22:13.823
No one has seen her this morning.

22:13.825 --> 22:16.341
Where's that war empath that
crawled into town yesterday?

22:17.479 --> 22:18.594
Major beauregard.

22:19.742 --> 22:20.824
The last I saw of him was

22:20.826 --> 22:22.771
when I was locking up for the night.

22:22.773 --> 22:23.845
Where?

22:23.847 --> 22:25.916
He was walking into the hotel.

22:25.918 --> 22:27.595
He rented a room there, same as you.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.436
I didn't think nothing of it.

22:29.438 --> 22:30.438
The hotel.

22:34.406 --> 22:35.828
Don't give me that look, huck.

22:53.702 --> 22:54.702
Hey.

22:57.461 --> 22:58.696
What'd this beauregard
say when you told him

22:58.698 --> 23:00.089
you wouldn't finance his war?

23:01.633 --> 23:02.806
He did not say much.

23:07.196 --> 23:08.298
He met your daughter?

23:09.257 --> 23:10.408
He knows she's with you.

23:11.981 --> 23:12.981
Si.

23:14.849 --> 23:16.065
My money says that
son of a bitch took her

23:16.067 --> 23:19.546
- with him when he left.
- What? Why?

23:19.548 --> 23:21.095
- Ransom.
- Ransom?

23:27.997 --> 23:29.549
Think about it.

23:29.551 --> 23:30.798
She's nowhere to be found.

23:31.718 --> 23:33.984
- Her things still in her room?
- Yes.

23:34.797 --> 23:37.447
I bet that hotel says he
skinned out early this morning.

23:38.355 --> 23:39.504
Di me.

23:39.506 --> 23:41.916
- What can I do?
- Depends.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.352
Stay here, wait.

23:45.567 --> 23:47.828
Go to Mexico, hope he finds you.

23:47.830 --> 23:49.545
No, I can pay someone

23:49.547 --> 23:51.645
to hunt him down like a dog and kill him.

23:51.647 --> 23:52.647
That's an option.

23:54.716 --> 23:57.754
I'll need a posse, a bounty hunter.

23:57.756 --> 24:00.871
That's no good, not in this town.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.441
You've got to go to lubbock
for that sort of thing.

24:03.443 --> 24:04.501
You can do it.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.855
Me? No.

24:06.857 --> 24:07.857
My days are over.

24:08.804 --> 24:10.874
No, I'll pay you 10,000 in gold.

24:10.876 --> 24:12.231
Just bring Marisol home.

24:14.424 --> 24:16.781
Think about it. You want
a ranch of your own?

24:16.783 --> 24:19.620
Land? All of it.

24:19.622 --> 24:21.092
I am a man of my word.

24:22.221 --> 24:24.185
I can set you up for
the rest of your life.

24:24.187 --> 24:27.787
Just bring me my daughter, and
you will see that I am true.

24:32.195 --> 24:34.414
I can't. I'm sorry.

24:36.319 --> 24:37.319
Good luck.

24:47.686 --> 24:50.041
What's the matter with you?

24:50.043 --> 24:50.901
Quick, give me a bourbon,

24:50.903 --> 24:53.205
before I change my mind
and do something stupid.

24:55.219 --> 24:57.383
It's a little early to
be drinking, even for you.

25:07.718 --> 25:10.595
Well, you know you're gonna
help that man find his daughter.

25:11.633 --> 25:12.633
I can't.

25:13.491 --> 25:15.983
I promised myself I wouldn't kill again.

25:15.985 --> 25:17.637
Well, who says you've gotta kill?

25:19.629 --> 25:21.656
Men like beauregard
don't listen to reason.

25:22.756 --> 25:23.768
All the more reason for you to stop him

25:23.770 --> 25:25.655
before he hurts somebody else.

25:28.683 --> 25:30.052
What if I can't find her?

25:30.054 --> 25:32.378
Well, there's always the
livery over there for ya.

25:36.087 --> 25:40.882
I came here to start
again, live a peaceful life.

25:42.784 --> 25:46.308
Well, you know what they say
about people who start again?

25:46.310 --> 25:47.310
It's a good thing.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.434
Kind of scary when you find out

25:49.436 --> 25:52.193
what you're really made of in the process.

26:35.883 --> 26:36.883
I'll do it.

26:38.856 --> 26:40.201
10,000, not a penny less.

26:41.109 --> 26:43.232
Of course. I am a man of my word.

26:48.273 --> 26:50.875
I'm gonna go to my ranch,
pack some belongings.

26:52.954 --> 26:54.141
And I'll be on the trail at first light.

26:54.143 --> 26:56.059
I'll do everything in my
power to bring her back.

26:56.061 --> 26:58.826
Please. Just bring my mijita back to me.

27:00.329 --> 27:02.422
I won't kill arliss
without a good reason.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.325
If he touches one hair on her head...

27:06.629 --> 27:07.732
That's a good reason.

27:08.595 --> 27:10.694
I can have my vaqueros ride with you.

27:10.696 --> 27:13.259
No. No, it's best I go alone.

27:14.436 --> 27:16.966
Besides, I don't know
how long I might be gone.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.088
Then find me before you ride

27:18.090 --> 27:20.152
and I will give you
half the gold up front.

27:21.178 --> 27:22.514
Just bring me my daughter.

27:44.169 --> 27:46.929
You'll never get away with this.

27:46.931 --> 27:48.020
Is that right?

27:48.022 --> 27:49.455
My father will send his vaqueros for me,

27:49.457 --> 27:51.402
and when they find you...

27:51.404 --> 27:55.438
"When." "when" is key
word in your sentence.

27:56.711 --> 27:58.684
What are you going to do with me?

27:58.686 --> 27:59.686
Right now?

28:02.235 --> 28:03.235
Nothing.

28:05.869 --> 28:07.411
But you see this?

28:07.413 --> 28:09.157
This here is a ransom note

28:09.159 --> 28:11.878
that's gonna be delivered
to your father demanding

28:11.880 --> 28:16.675
$10,000 in exchange for your
safe return back to Mexico.

28:18.634 --> 28:19.654
Your war money.

28:23.151 --> 28:24.252
With that kind of money,

28:24.254 --> 28:26.631
we can fund the army through the new year,

28:26.633 --> 28:28.928
should Lee roll over and die.

28:32.070 --> 28:36.106
My father is many
things, loyal, wealthy.

28:36.108 --> 28:37.703
A fool is not one of them.

28:39.954 --> 28:42.013
Well neither am I.

28:42.015 --> 28:46.109
With that kind of money, I
could promote myself to general,

28:46.111 --> 28:48.473
take command of my own private army.

28:49.282 --> 28:52.429
Hell, your
father couldn't touch me

28:52.431 --> 28:56.588
with a copper cannonball,
even if he tried.

29:06.423 --> 29:08.037
Shame, really.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.768
Hey, mister, you want
a drink or something?

30:23.770 --> 30:24.825
I'll have a whiskey.

30:25.717 --> 30:27.978
You're new in town, ain't you?

30:27.980 --> 30:28.980
How can you tell?

30:30.157 --> 30:31.311
It's pretty obvious.

30:34.330 --> 30:37.022
I don't get nothing but regulars
walking in and out of here,

30:37.024 --> 30:39.793
let alone an ex-soldier like yourself.

30:39.795 --> 30:40.795
Soldier?

30:41.991 --> 30:44.929
Obvious. Y'all carry
it in your shoulders.

30:47.669 --> 30:48.779
The reason I'm in
town is I'm looking for

30:48.781 --> 30:50.904
a fellow that goes by arliss beauregard.

30:52.311 --> 30:54.820
He says he's a major,
but I have my doubts.

30:54.822 --> 30:56.687
He might've come through
on a recruiting trip.

30:56.689 --> 30:57.689
Recruiting?

30:58.609 --> 31:00.988
Yeah. For confederate men
looking to join the cause?

31:00.990 --> 31:02.959
What cause would that be, sugar?

31:04.133 --> 31:05.133
A senseless one.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.917
Well, what's this
arliss feller look like?

31:09.027 --> 31:10.034
Not like a soldier.

31:10.993 --> 31:13.149
Looks like he's been counting
money his whole life.

31:13.151 --> 31:14.541
- Got a girl with him.
- Wife?

31:15.500 --> 31:19.315
Hostage, a Mexican. That's
why I'm looking for him.

31:19.317 --> 31:20.783
Well, like I said,

31:20.785 --> 31:23.614
I don't get nothing but regulars
coming in and out of here.

31:28.581 --> 31:30.419
Thanks for the drink.

31:32.239 --> 31:35.356
Ma'am.

31:54.343 --> 31:55.463
Hey, mister.

31:56.702 --> 31:58.166
About that man you're looking for...

31:58.168 --> 31:59.454
What about him?

31:59.456 --> 32:01.858
Is there a reward or
a bounty or something?

32:01.860 --> 32:03.441
Perhaps.

32:03.443 --> 32:06.821
Well, meet me out back,

32:07.950 --> 32:09.056
- at dark.
- At dark.

32:24.858 --> 32:26.968
Your man came through
here a few days ago.

32:27.994 --> 32:30.342
Why did you lie to me in the bar?

32:30.344 --> 32:33.080
Small town and lots of
ears in that old place.

32:33.988 --> 32:35.708
Fair enough. So?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.386
Like I said, he came through here,

32:39.388 --> 32:41.304
Mexican gal with him.

32:41.306 --> 32:42.651
He bought a bottle of rye.

32:43.722 --> 32:46.363
Got a big old room at the hotel up yonder.

32:47.175 --> 32:49.129
He asked about a couple of whores, too.

32:49.131 --> 32:50.443
Which I thought was mighty strange

32:50.445 --> 32:52.987
being he had that pretty
young lady with him already.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.075
I guess he doesn't want the trouble

32:55.077 --> 32:57.991
that comes with touching a woman
who don't wanna be touched,

32:57.993 --> 33:00.149
especially with her father
being who he is and all.

33:00.151 --> 33:03.218
What? Is she some kind of
Mexican royalty or something?

33:03.220 --> 33:04.220
More or less.

33:08.063 --> 33:09.063
What's this for?

33:09.852 --> 33:11.252
Did they say where they were going?

33:16.969 --> 33:18.704
Son of a bitch.

33:59.276 --> 34:01.110
- Evening.
- No vacancies.

34:02.258 --> 34:04.400
I ain't looking for a
room. I'm looking for a man.

34:05.231 --> 34:07.483
Goes by the name of beauregard,
have you heard of him?

34:07.485 --> 34:09.498
Well, I can't give out that information.

34:10.679 --> 34:11.885
What about now?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.821
Arliss beauregard,
checked out two days ago.

34:21.822 --> 34:22.822
Alone?

34:24.681 --> 34:28.121
Well, it doesn't
say, but I seem to remember

34:28.123 --> 34:29.898
he had several lady friends with him.

34:30.770 --> 34:31.824
Any of them Mexican?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.060
Well, perhaps. Don't really recall.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.322
Make any mention of where he was going?

34:39.324 --> 34:41.414
Well, now that you mention it,

34:41.416 --> 34:43.572
I did overhear him talking
to the hotel barkeep

34:43.574 --> 34:45.786
- about Jackson.
- Mississippi?

34:45.789 --> 34:46.844
Yep. That's the one.

34:47.963 --> 34:50.649
He even had us telegram a
letter for him before he left.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.321
A letter, huh?

34:52.322 --> 34:53.867
Oh yeah. First class.

34:54.909 --> 34:57.439
Not to Jackson, though. San Antonio.

34:57.441 --> 34:59.942
Said he had some business down there.

34:59.944 --> 35:01.981
Did you see what was on
that letter by any chance?

35:04.203 --> 35:05.203
Nope.

35:05.948 --> 35:07.022
How about now?

35:29.067 --> 35:30.067
Afternoon.

35:30.845 --> 35:32.267
- How are you?
- Doing well.

35:33.312 --> 35:34.158
I'm looking for an arliss beauregard.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.165
Do you know where I can find him?

35:36.167 --> 35:37.167
Right that way.

35:39.893 --> 35:41.373
- Much obliged.
- Have a good evening.

35:56.881 --> 35:58.240
May I help you?

35:59.693 --> 36:01.515
You're a long way from Texas, major.

36:05.159 --> 36:06.159
Excuse me?

36:07.806 --> 36:10.283
It's over. Where is she?

36:11.249 --> 36:12.924
And you are?

36:12.926 --> 36:14.796
It doesn't matter who I am.

36:14.798 --> 36:15.852
I'm here for the girl.

36:18.701 --> 36:21.288
Don't tell me that mister garza paid you

36:21.290 --> 36:25.920
to come all the way here to
save his previous little Nina.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.848
It's more noble that
what you're doing here.

36:27.850 --> 36:28.850
Is that right?

36:30.861 --> 36:33.238
I'm taking Marisol garza back to Texas.

36:36.107 --> 36:38.834
I might just have
something to say about that.

36:40.087 --> 36:43.409
You see, Marisol is my fiance.

36:44.230 --> 36:46.756
We are to be married in the fall.

36:48.872 --> 36:50.790
I ain't here to argue with you, major.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.269
And I ain't asking.

36:55.835 --> 36:57.003
We're getting her together.

36:57.005 --> 37:00.388
There's no need to. She's right outside.

37:00.390 --> 37:02.970
Marisol, darling, come in here.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.436
Come here, darling.

37:11.438 --> 37:14.429
This man's got some kind of crazy idea

37:14.431 --> 37:17.435
that you're here being
held against your will.

37:18.458 --> 37:22.087
I informed him that we are
gonna be married in September.

37:23.896 --> 37:26.397
And then I got to thinking,

37:26.399 --> 37:28.857
maybe we should extend him an invite.

37:31.751 --> 37:33.312
What do you say?

37:33.314 --> 37:34.657
Whatever you say, my love.

37:35.769 --> 37:38.975
Marisol, your father sent me.

37:39.807 --> 37:43.550
Oh! Did he get the telegram?

37:44.449 --> 37:47.142
He's gonna make one
hell of a father-in-law.

37:47.144 --> 37:48.705
Don't you think, Marisol?

37:48.707 --> 37:50.323
What telegram are you talking about?

37:50.325 --> 37:52.464
Why the ransom note.

37:52.466 --> 37:54.651
I knew that he would be more than happy

37:54.653 --> 37:59.297
to financially support
our struggle for Liberty.

38:00.743 --> 38:04.836
You blackmailed him, in
exchange for his own daughter.

38:04.838 --> 38:08.960
I gave him every chance
to support this cause.

38:08.962 --> 38:12.086
He chose to turn his back on me

38:12.088 --> 38:15.361
and the freedom of every
man south of the Dixon.

38:16.174 --> 38:20.969
Now he was either too stupid
not to see what was coming

38:21.132 --> 38:23.010
or he was too blind not to see

38:23.012 --> 38:25.450
what was going on right under his nose.

38:27.117 --> 38:31.528
I'm curious. What did he
offer you to come get her?

38:34.204 --> 38:35.498
Everything you asked for.

38:36.697 --> 38:37.697
All of it.

38:38.674 --> 38:41.233
He ain't paying you a red
cent, you son of a bitch.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.253
Hey! Where'd you go?

38:55.130 --> 38:57.192
This is how it's going
to work, journeyman!

38:58.439 --> 39:00.902
You're either going to ride back to Texas

39:00.904 --> 39:05.524
and tell her father you
couldn't find his little girl,

39:05.526 --> 39:08.703
or I'm gonna put a bullet
in the side of her skull.

39:09.611 --> 39:12.035
Now, what's it going to be?

39:12.037 --> 39:13.037
Alright!

39:15.164 --> 39:16.171
Don't shoot the girl!

39:18.224 --> 39:19.475
I'm coming out.

39:19.477 --> 39:21.348
- What's your answer?
- I repeat,

39:21.350 --> 39:22.437
do not shoot the girl!

39:33.060 --> 39:35.355
That's what I thought, yeah.

39:36.204 --> 39:39.148
Now, I'm gonna give you three seconds

39:39.150 --> 39:42.298
to get on your horse and
ride the hell out of here,

39:43.153 --> 39:44.961
or Marisol's gonna die.

40:17.694 --> 40:18.694
Hey, Tully.

40:21.675 --> 40:25.167
How could you betray the south?

40:27.485 --> 40:30.962
How could you betray the confederacy?

40:30.964 --> 40:33.195
$10,000 and a bullet cuts a lot of ties.

40:42.264 --> 40:43.264
Let's go.

40:52.466 --> 40:54.314
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yes.

40:54.316 --> 40:56.256
It's alright, he's gone.

40:56.258 --> 40:57.916
No one's gonna hurt you.

40:57.918 --> 41:00.372
Don't worry, no one's going to hurt you.

41:00.374 --> 41:01.510
You're going home.

41:01.512 --> 41:02.960
Alright? You're going home.

41:10.661 --> 41:12.244
How long is the ride back home?

41:15.949 --> 41:17.147
About a week.

41:19.739 --> 41:20.890
No one's gonna hurt you.

41:24.261 --> 41:26.083
Does my father know I'm still alive?

41:27.841 --> 41:29.404
I don't really know what he knows.

41:31.425 --> 41:33.151
I haven't been back in eight months.

41:37.610 --> 41:38.777
They got those in laredo?

41:40.248 --> 41:42.118
I take it you haven't been to laredo.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.293
Once, a long time ago.

41:48.185 --> 41:49.384
I went out west to fight.

41:52.602 --> 41:54.424
I was with the volunteers in Missouri.

41:56.427 --> 41:58.968
By the time we got to
San antone, it was 1842.

42:03.543 --> 42:05.502
700 of us on the way to mier.

42:10.534 --> 42:12.261
Somervell had had it with the raids.

42:14.735 --> 42:15.735
We took laredo,

42:17.449 --> 42:18.900
guererro not long after that.

42:21.630 --> 42:25.997
Two days before Christmas,
well that same 700,

42:27.059 --> 42:28.740
we all went across the rio grande.

42:31.633 --> 42:32.430
What we didn't know,

42:32.432 --> 42:34.312
there was 1,000 Mexicans waiting for us.

42:38.414 --> 42:39.433
We were outnumbered.

42:46.345 --> 42:47.863
Still ended up killing 600.

42:49.948 --> 42:51.958
Left another 200 for dead.

42:55.647 --> 42:58.045
The day after Christmas,
the Mexicans surrendered.

43:02.191 --> 43:04.013
I never seen so much blood or fear.

43:09.237 --> 43:10.645
Some of us had made it back over

43:10.647 --> 43:12.040
with the skin on our backs.

43:16.662 --> 43:18.980
The Mexicans caught the rest.

43:20.420 --> 43:21.714
Executed one for every ten.

43:28.828 --> 43:33.224
When the war was over, well,
I was gonna live in Texas.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.950
I signed up for Lee's army
and went and fought the north.

43:43.130 --> 43:44.331
Worst mistake of my life.

43:48.124 --> 43:49.124
Why?

43:54.073 --> 43:55.672
No one wins a war.

43:57.793 --> 43:58.793
Poor people die,

44:00.907 --> 44:02.237
and the rich get richer.

44:05.814 --> 44:08.681
I saw it the same in Mexico
as I did in Virginia.

44:09.928 --> 44:12.304
I just thought I could make a difference.

44:12.306 --> 44:15.845
- Did you?
- A difference?

44:17.041 --> 44:18.041
Hell no.

44:22.355 --> 44:24.913
I am thankful you came for me.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.324
It wasn't an easy choice,

44:35.110 --> 44:36.225
but it was the right one.

44:42.063 --> 44:43.309
Time to get some shut eye.

44:44.220 --> 44:45.275
We've got a long trip.

45:04.552 --> 45:07.169
Marisol! Mari.

45:07.171 --> 45:09.614
Oye. Are you okay?

45:09.616 --> 45:10.616
I'm fine.

45:13.793 --> 45:14.793
Oye.

45:16.879 --> 45:19.070
I was worried sick.

45:19.072 --> 45:22.005
I never heard back from you
after he sent the telegram,

45:22.007 --> 45:25.321
and I thought for sure you were be dead.

45:25.323 --> 45:27.692
I told you that I didn't
know how long it was gonna be.

45:27.694 --> 45:28.694
And beauregard?

45:31.386 --> 45:32.880
Bueno. A deal is a deal.

45:32.882 --> 45:34.280
Please, come inside.

45:34.282 --> 45:35.913
Let's share a drink and celebrate.

45:39.663 --> 45:42.106
Thank you, but it's been a long trip.

45:42.108 --> 45:45.372
Of course. I'll stop by in
the morning with your payment.

46:14.102 --> 46:16.473
Ah, I thought you would be sleeping.

46:21.333 --> 46:22.675
Not much sleep these days.

46:23.654 --> 46:24.744
Ah, me either.

46:25.821 --> 46:28.698
Look, I just wanted to stop by
before I head back to laredo.

46:31.853 --> 46:34.671
I cannot thank you enough
for what you have done.

46:34.673 --> 46:36.546
Marisol told me what had happened.

46:44.551 --> 46:46.314
I'm just happy to be home.

46:46.316 --> 46:47.371
Thanks for the bounty.

46:48.464 --> 46:49.474
It is not a bounty.

46:51.485 --> 46:52.500
Excuse me?

46:52.502 --> 46:54.787
It is not a bounty
or a payment for a job.

46:57.076 --> 46:58.249
It is a wedding present.

47:05.650 --> 47:07.221
I don't want to marry your daughter.

47:07.223 --> 47:08.805
Ah, but she wants to marry you.

47:09.860 --> 47:12.448
Look, make it easy for her.

47:12.450 --> 47:14.759
A man should ask for a
woman's hand in marriage,

47:14.761 --> 47:16.001
not the other way around.

47:18.607 --> 47:19.892
What about Mexico?

47:19.894 --> 47:22.570
Mexico. She is in love.

47:23.814 --> 47:24.821
Who am I to stop her?

47:32.932 --> 47:35.809
I ain't never been married before.

47:37.357 --> 47:40.249
It will not be easy,
but I have faith in you.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.543
Sorry. I did
not mean to scare you.

47:53.545 --> 47:56.247
- Your father was...
- My answer is yes.

47:56.249 --> 47:58.630
I overheard you talking about the wedding.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.247
I ain't the right guy.

48:07.035 --> 48:08.874
How do you know that?

48:11.715 --> 48:13.794
What if it doesn't work?

48:15.111 --> 48:16.950
Then it doesn't work.

48:21.407 --> 48:22.424
Then it's settled.

48:24.285 --> 48:28.552
Yes.

48:31.407 --> 48:33.590
This gold isn't safe here, okay?

48:33.592 --> 48:34.389
Okay.

48:34.391 --> 48:35.558
I'm gonna take it to the bank.

48:35.560 --> 48:36.357
I will go with you.

48:36.359 --> 48:37.634
No, no, no, no. You stay here.

48:38.687 --> 48:40.125
You stay here and wait for me.

48:41.261 --> 48:42.411
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

49:01.886 --> 49:04.214
Hey, there. I wanna talk to you.

49:04.216 --> 49:05.876
Now what you got in that there bag?

49:05.878 --> 49:07.638
None of your business
what's in this bag.

49:07.640 --> 49:08.530
Yeah, it is.

49:08.532 --> 49:10.927
It become my business in Jackson.

49:10.929 --> 49:12.807
What do you think, Waylon?

49:12.809 --> 49:16.399
Well, I do think we
ought to have a look-see.

49:17.643 --> 49:20.595
Now, don't make us have
to go visit the girl,

49:20.597 --> 49:22.925
cooperative as she is known to be.

49:22.927 --> 49:25.965
Yeah. Wasn't that arliss's woman?

49:25.967 --> 49:27.644
I believe there was gonna be a marriage

49:27.646 --> 49:29.033
as a matter of fact.

49:29.035 --> 49:31.441
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

49:31.443 --> 49:33.638
Convince a Texas judge otherwise,

49:33.640 --> 49:36.726
especially with two eye-witness soldiers.

49:36.728 --> 49:38.557
I believe that there is gold.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.749
- Oh, no shit?
- A lot of it, too.

49:41.785 --> 49:43.755
Well, hell, it looks
like we might've hit

49:43.757 --> 49:44.951
the jackpot with this one, Tully.

49:44.953 --> 49:46.431
I believe so.

49:46.433 --> 49:48.617
Take the gold and leave town.

49:48.619 --> 49:50.286
Are you trying to give orders now, boy?

49:50.288 --> 49:52.914
The man we take orders
from is dead because of you.

49:52.916 --> 49:56.156
We tracked you all the way into Texas.

49:56.158 --> 49:58.445
This is gonna be your penance.

50:02.823 --> 50:04.806
We oughta make it quick,
before someone sees us.

50:04.808 --> 50:06.834
Nah, let's make him remember that.

50:16.169 --> 50:18.299
Come on. Let's get outta here.

50:39.471 --> 50:40.679
How was your day?

50:47.140 --> 50:48.140
Same.

50:50.546 --> 50:51.996
Did you get the corral repaired?

50:53.892 --> 50:54.892
Yep.

50:56.793 --> 50:58.254
And?

50:58.256 --> 50:59.668
- And what?
- That's it?

51:01.277 --> 51:03.207
That's it? It's a god-damned fence.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.198
Alright? It was broken and now it's fixed.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.917
You don't have to be an asshole.

51:15.499 --> 51:20.292
Every day, we talk about the fence.

51:20.294 --> 51:21.294
Every day.

51:23.248 --> 51:26.665
Now it's fixed, so I
want you to be satisfied.

51:27.900 --> 51:28.696
Now look, don't take this out on me.

51:28.698 --> 51:31.106
I'm not the one who
lost the gold, you did.

51:31.108 --> 51:32.738
We need to make a life without it.

51:36.675 --> 51:37.998
Have I never complained?

51:45.309 --> 51:46.309
You don't have to.

51:47.876 --> 51:48.876
Oh really?

51:49.900 --> 51:51.386
I see the way you look at me.

51:53.122 --> 51:55.523
- And how is that?
- Ashamed.

52:03.988 --> 52:06.242
How many times has my
father offered us help?

52:09.838 --> 52:10.973
I don't want his money.

52:11.872 --> 52:13.692
Not just his money,
but moving to laredo?

52:13.694 --> 52:17.437
A texan living in
Mexico? No way in hell.

52:18.882 --> 52:20.501
- What do you want from me?
- I want the man I married,

52:20.503 --> 52:22.438
not the man you are now.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.337
I don't want him. Where
is James Orville bain?

52:24.339 --> 52:25.401
That's the man I want.

52:26.746 --> 52:27.543
I hate it when you use that name.

52:27.545 --> 52:28.739
Yeah, it was your grandfather's name.

52:28.741 --> 52:30.528
- You should be proud.
- I am proud!

52:34.361 --> 52:36.794
That's exactly why I
hate it that you stayed!

52:41.669 --> 52:43.225
You'd rather have me leave.

52:51.266 --> 52:53.503
I didn't mean what I said.

52:56.542 --> 52:58.867
I don't want you to go anywhere.

53:01.732 --> 53:05.120
This life I imagined
when I set out after you,

53:08.359 --> 53:09.685
it's not what's happened.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.511
I wanted something more.

53:13.458 --> 53:14.596
Honey, you're wrong.

53:18.352 --> 53:20.625
I married you, James Orville bain,

53:22.695 --> 53:24.853
and I love you to this day.

53:26.885 --> 53:29.474
You aren't just some man who
shovels out horse stalls.

53:34.185 --> 53:36.733
I don't know if I can
find that other man.

53:36.735 --> 53:39.044
Well, we can try together.

53:39.046 --> 53:42.068
We can find him, the two of us.

54:07.363 --> 54:09.521
Now, here's a good thing.

54:12.424 --> 54:15.381
I don't know, Waylon. I don't know.

54:16.553 --> 54:18.353
But if I was a betting man,

54:20.546 --> 54:21.546
which I am,

54:24.257 --> 54:26.989
we're gonna have all of our luck up here,

54:26.991 --> 54:28.442
uphill, in the north track.

54:29.379 --> 54:31.153
That old man ain't ever gonna sell.

54:32.707 --> 54:33.707
Family land.

54:35.085 --> 54:38.097
Oh, we just haven't made
him the right offer yet.

54:38.099 --> 54:38.896
And what would that be?

54:38.898 --> 54:40.034
What was the last offer?

54:41.607 --> 54:43.686
Well, I've got my notes.

54:45.356 --> 54:46.452
Let's see.

54:48.588 --> 54:49.588
Yep.

54:50.432 --> 54:51.895
- $200.
- $200.

54:51.897 --> 54:54.216
- Cash in hand.
- Make it three $300.

54:54.218 --> 54:56.009
Tell him we can start drilling next month.

54:56.011 --> 54:59.313
A month advance on top, that's 600 total.

55:00.247 --> 55:01.289
- $600?
- Yeah.

55:02.139 --> 55:02.953
You sure about that?

55:02.955 --> 55:04.602
If he don't sell for
that, he's a damned fool.

55:04.604 --> 55:06.378
Do you want the tract or not, Waylon?

55:07.913 --> 55:10.352
You've gotta spend money to make money.

55:10.354 --> 55:11.151
I guess that makes sense.

55:11.153 --> 55:13.771
And that reminds me,
too, there's a racehorse

55:13.773 --> 55:15.739
I want to look at just outside of Austin.

55:17.475 --> 55:20.426
- That's in Texas.
- Why?

55:20.428 --> 55:22.251
- You wanna go back to Texas?
- Yeah.

55:23.795 --> 55:26.792
Well, what about the
fellow we damn near killed?

55:26.794 --> 55:29.930
"Damn near killed?" I
believe he bellied up, Waylon.

55:29.932 --> 55:32.649
I've seen tougher men die
from less, so have you.

55:33.529 --> 55:35.047
Well, how do you know he's dead?

55:36.780 --> 55:38.054
You know how I know he's dead?

55:38.056 --> 55:39.741
'Cause I can't for the life of me remember

55:39.743 --> 55:40.743
what he looks like.

55:41.847 --> 55:42.782
And that's just how.

55:42.784 --> 55:44.057
That happens every time.

55:44.059 --> 55:46.373
You know, when they're
gone they're just gone.

55:47.761 --> 55:49.859
But what I do remember clear as the day is

55:49.861 --> 55:52.008
that sweet seniorita he had with him.

55:52.010 --> 55:53.667
Remember her?

55:53.669 --> 55:54.789
She was awfully pretty.

55:54.791 --> 55:56.942
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
bumping into her again.

55:58.713 --> 56:00.190
Alright. Well...

56:01.255 --> 56:04.082
When do you wanna go?

56:04.084 --> 56:05.971
I say we settle up the
tract with the old man

56:05.973 --> 56:07.410
and catch a train down to Austin

56:07.412 --> 56:09.385
and ride the rest of the way.

56:09.387 --> 56:11.380
You know, it's been awhile

56:11.382 --> 56:14.368
since I took a horse on a nice long ride.

56:17.951 --> 56:18.951
I got it.

56:28.322 --> 56:30.700
How are you
and the lady holding up?

56:32.002 --> 56:33.002
Why do you ask?

56:33.737 --> 56:35.385
Just making conversation.

56:35.387 --> 56:36.387
No you ain't.

56:36.989 --> 56:39.068
She said something, didn't she?

56:39.070 --> 56:39.979
Well, she came through here

56:39.981 --> 56:41.803
a couple of days ago, looking for you.

56:42.685 --> 56:44.795
Kind of sounded like
the honeymoon was over.

56:47.356 --> 56:49.142
Yeah, for a very long time.

56:52.861 --> 56:54.566
Well, maybe that
racehorse coming into town

56:54.568 --> 56:55.860
will cheer you up.

56:55.862 --> 56:56.965
What racehorse?

57:00.770 --> 57:01.770
You haven't heard?

57:03.842 --> 57:04.993
Tully and Waylon Ford?

57:07.265 --> 57:09.345
What? You know those two men?

57:09.347 --> 57:11.617
Oilmen from Mississippi?

57:11.619 --> 57:13.259
- I'll be damned. It's them.
- Who?

57:14.923 --> 57:17.386
Those two sons of bitches
that jumped me five years back.

57:20.328 --> 57:21.124
Are you sure?

57:21.126 --> 57:22.781
I'll never forget their faces.

57:22.783 --> 57:24.561
They're coming through San antone?

57:24.563 --> 57:25.923
- Here, look at that.
- Let me see.

57:27.846 --> 57:31.311
Yeah. It says their horse
won first place last year.

57:33.397 --> 57:35.071
And they're taking the horse on tour.

57:36.037 --> 57:39.123
Says they're looking to sell
some of their stock too.

57:39.125 --> 57:42.532
I've got to convince them
to meet me here, alone.

57:44.802 --> 57:46.694
- Jim...
- Hey, hey.

57:50.604 --> 57:51.401
Somehow I'll do it.

57:51.403 --> 57:54.280
I'll get 'em alone, tell 'em
I'm here to buy that horse.

57:56.771 --> 57:58.035
Let me get my gold back,

57:58.037 --> 58:00.632
put those sons of bitches in the dirt.

58:02.717 --> 58:04.753
You think they've got that gold on them?

58:05.583 --> 58:06.618
They just travel the country

58:06.620 --> 58:08.810
with a pot of gold on their hip?

58:09.709 --> 58:11.097
- Do you Irish...
- Hey.

58:11.099 --> 58:14.300
You said it yourself, "oilmen."

58:14.302 --> 58:16.938
Well I don't know so much about that.

58:16.940 --> 58:19.050
Alright. Somehow we'll
get 'em to the bar.

58:20.059 --> 58:22.795
I don't know how yet, but I'm gonna do it,

58:22.797 --> 58:24.188
convince 'em I'm here to buy that horse.

58:24.190 --> 58:25.886
You think somebody's
really going to sell

58:25.888 --> 58:27.387
a first place racehorse?

58:28.573 --> 58:32.086
If that offer is big enough,
they sure as shit will.

58:34.145 --> 58:36.497
- Why here?
- Hey, people here know me,

58:37.747 --> 58:39.087
know what I've been through.

58:40.369 --> 58:42.335
This is my chance to set things straight,

58:43.920 --> 58:44.920
get my life back.

58:46.286 --> 58:48.505
- What about Marisol?
- What about her?

58:50.257 --> 58:51.885
She'll cut my man-parts off

58:51.887 --> 58:54.189
if she finds out I had
anything to do with this.

58:56.577 --> 58:58.543
Huck, you can help me with this or not.

59:01.756 --> 59:03.050
Now, that's what I thought.

59:32.103 --> 59:33.493
Christ, Waylon.

59:34.493 --> 59:35.924
What? Did I scare you, brother?

59:35.926 --> 59:37.737
I think I had a god damned heart attack.

59:37.739 --> 59:39.506
What've you got for me today to do?

59:41.939 --> 59:44.138
- Central union gram.
- What's it say?

59:45.008 --> 59:48.881
Well, apparently some old
boy down in Texas wants to buy

59:48.883 --> 59:51.359
- one of our horses.
- How much?

59:51.361 --> 59:52.560
You're gonna like this.

59:53.477 --> 59:55.959
- $1,000.
- Oh, no shit.

59:55.961 --> 59:57.207
That's all I need to know.

59:58.914 --> 01:00:01.358
Heard about your good fortune
in the San Antonio express.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.602
I told you they'd be reading
our names in the paper.

01:00:03.604 --> 01:00:05.207
Congratulations to you.

01:00:05.209 --> 01:00:07.603
I, too, am a horse breeder,

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:11.620
though I have not had the good
fortune you have experienced.

01:00:11.622 --> 01:00:15.135
I will be in San Antonio for
several more days on business.

01:00:15.937 --> 01:00:18.621
I'd much like to purchase
some stock from you.

01:00:18.623 --> 01:00:20.589
I was so...

01:00:23.063 --> 01:00:24.020
It's "impressed."

01:00:24.022 --> 01:00:25.748
Yeah, I know what it says, Waylon.

01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:29.458
"Impressed with your horse
and the story I read of,

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.206
we wanted to buy your stock sight unseen."

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:36.705
Well, you hear that? "Sight unseen."

01:00:36.707 --> 01:00:38.928
For a horse breeder,
that's not too bright.

01:00:42.877 --> 01:00:45.877
Well, I reckon we know a thing or two

01:00:45.879 --> 01:00:47.497
about making money off of texans,

01:00:47.499 --> 01:00:50.614
and we're going to San Antonio
for just a couple of days.

01:00:50.616 --> 01:00:52.446
Set it up. Let's do it.

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:55.712
$1,000, we could us buy
two horses for that.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.480
Consider it done.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.724
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:01:15.726 --> 01:01:16.640
When your name is Ford

01:01:16.642 --> 01:01:19.453
and you own the finest racehorse in Texas,

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:20.714
it's always a fine day.

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:24.459
Racing man, huh?

01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:26.032
Yes, sir. I breed 'em.

01:01:26.034 --> 01:01:27.950
Finest stock this side of Kentucky.

01:01:27.952 --> 01:01:29.916
Just proved that a couple of days ago.

01:01:29.918 --> 01:01:31.834
This spring we're gonna
race her in the saratoga,

01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:34.394
and the whole world's gonna
know how great my stock is.

01:01:34.396 --> 01:01:35.396
Our stock.

01:01:37.484 --> 01:01:40.084
Well, that calls for
a drink on the house.

01:01:40.086 --> 01:01:41.832
That's mighty fine of you.

01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:44.152
- Bourbon?
- Bourbon.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.740
Whew.

01:01:52.398 --> 01:01:54.247
To the confederacy.

01:01:54.249 --> 01:01:56.759
And all those hard-nosed
southern sons of bitches

01:01:56.761 --> 01:01:58.524
who never buckled under.

01:01:58.526 --> 01:01:59.964
- Hear, hear.
- To the south.

01:02:03.973 --> 01:02:07.170
Mm.

01:02:08.188 --> 01:02:10.208
I'll have another.

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.217
Yes, sir.

01:02:13.765 --> 01:02:16.424
Tastes like home.

01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:19.196
Gentlemen.

01:02:23.883 --> 01:02:25.881
Well, color me purple.

01:02:26.798 --> 01:02:27.885
You're tubby Ford.

01:02:29.129 --> 01:02:30.129
Tully.

01:02:30.874 --> 01:02:32.073
And you're Waylon Ford?

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:36.751
You two own the southern
oil and gas company?

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.324
That's right.

01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:40.185
Racehorses and oil fields,

01:02:40.187 --> 01:02:42.184
the best two vices on god's green earth.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:49.334
What brings two famous types
like you to this shit hole?

01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:51.894
Well, we were invited to your fair town.

01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:54.024
There's a horse breeder
who wants to purchase

01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:56.364
- some of my stock.
- Our stock.

01:02:56.366 --> 01:02:58.924
Of course, Waylon, our stock.

01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:02.794
And we're to meet him right
here in your fine saloon.

01:03:04.604 --> 01:03:06.453
- Redbone?
- That's right.

01:03:06.455 --> 01:03:08.793
My pride and joy, you must have
read about him in the paper.

01:03:08.795 --> 01:03:09.828
- Indeed.
- Mm.

01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:13.502
I've also hear that horse traders are

01:03:13.504 --> 01:03:15.516
some of the most low-life sons of bitches

01:03:15.518 --> 01:03:17.640
known to walk the face of the earth.

01:03:19.325 --> 01:03:23.236
Yeah? Who would say something like that?

01:03:23.238 --> 01:03:25.696
Well, they come through
here from time to time.

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:28.511
I don't see many smiling faces.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.697
- I can tell you that.
- Hmm.

01:03:30.699 --> 01:03:33.076
Let me tell you something, barman.

01:03:33.078 --> 01:03:34.811
This is not a poor man's game.

01:03:34.813 --> 01:03:36.778
Not many folks can afford this business,

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.283
and if you can't run with the big dogs,

01:03:38.285 --> 01:03:39.799
stay under the porch.

01:03:39.801 --> 01:03:41.966
This fellow knows what I have for sale.

01:03:41.968 --> 01:03:43.740
We'll be walking outta
here with one less horse

01:03:43.742 --> 01:03:45.037
and a whole lot more money.

01:03:46.450 --> 01:03:47.955
Well, where's your buyer?

01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:50.487
Well, that I do not know.

01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:53.640
But you know what?

01:03:53.642 --> 01:03:56.192
As long as you've got
more of this fine bourbon,

01:03:56.194 --> 01:03:58.212
I reckon he can just take his sweet time.

01:03:58.214 --> 01:03:59.307
Come on, Waylon.

01:04:06.322 --> 01:04:09.749
- I don't understand.
- Which part?

01:04:09.751 --> 01:04:11.717
You think this will get your gold back?

01:04:16.191 --> 01:04:17.729
If it goes as planned, yes.

01:04:17.731 --> 01:04:19.205
Huck's gonna let me know
when they're good and drunk.

01:04:19.207 --> 01:04:20.227
And then what?

01:04:21.998 --> 01:04:23.416
It's best if you don't know.

01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:24.960
I don't want you involved in it.

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.254
I'm already involved.

01:04:26.256 --> 01:04:27.348
I don't want you anywhere near me

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:29.220
- when that shooting starts.
- Shooting?

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:35.404
I'm posing as a businessman
looking to buy racing stock.

01:04:35.406 --> 01:04:36.203
He's gonna meet me.

01:04:36.205 --> 01:04:38.290
I'm gonna confront him about the money.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:39.834
It's either that or I kill them.

01:04:39.836 --> 01:04:41.096
Kill them? Oh!

01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:46.006
They took everything from us.

01:04:47.993 --> 01:04:49.428
Don't you understand that?

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:50.655
I don't think this is a good idea.

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:53.213
You wanted to find Jim Orville bain?

01:04:53.215 --> 01:04:54.882
This is how we do it.

01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:55.908
This is not what I had in mind,

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:58.584
dios mio, to be a widow at 40 years old.

01:04:58.586 --> 01:05:01.834
When I rescued you in
Jackson, that was Jim.

01:05:03.762 --> 01:05:04.769
You have to trust me.

01:05:05.644 --> 01:05:06.651
This is the only way.

01:05:11.692 --> 01:05:15.036
No, Jim. We could run away to Mexico.

01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:18.091
My father would give
us a house to live in.

01:05:18.093 --> 01:05:20.728
You would have a lifetime job.

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.253
You could take over the ranch someday.

01:05:22.255 --> 01:05:23.293
We could talk to him.

01:05:25.868 --> 01:05:27.436
If I go to Mexico, I'm dead already.

01:05:28.328 --> 01:05:29.448
You know that.

01:05:30.512 --> 01:05:31.335
You gotta trust me.

01:05:31.337 --> 01:05:32.443
This is the only way.

01:05:35.892 --> 01:05:37.964
You just promise me
you'll stay right here.

01:05:40.491 --> 01:05:41.929
Okay, I promise.

01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:44.765
But you come back to me.

01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:47.318
I promise.

01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:53.552
I promise.

01:06:24.387 --> 01:06:25.387
Yeah.

01:06:26.448 --> 01:06:30.373
Barman! Another bottle, if you please.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.651
None of that rot-your-guts coffin varnish.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:36.065
I want more of that
bourbon, if you don't mind.

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.844
- Coming right up.
- Yeah.

01:06:41.804 --> 01:06:42.804
Well...

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.867
If you two don't plan
on draining that bottle,

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:48.125
I don't mind a little rum brave,

01:06:48.127 --> 01:06:51.136
but I got no room for stupid drunks.

01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:56.553
You know what we need?

01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:57.352
- We need whores.
- Yeah.

01:06:57.354 --> 01:06:58.881
You got any whores?

01:06:58.883 --> 01:07:00.276
No, I'm afraid we don't provide

01:07:00.278 --> 01:07:02.355
that type of service around here anymore.

01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:04.886
What the hell kind
of place you run around here?

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.076
You ain't got no whores?

01:07:07.078 --> 01:07:08.706
Just alcohol and cigars.

01:07:08.708 --> 01:07:12.504
It's family establishment.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.743
Barman, do you mind giving
us a little bit of privacy?

01:07:18.397 --> 01:07:21.461
I ain't even seen a
woman around here all day.

01:07:21.463 --> 01:07:22.463
No.

01:07:25.798 --> 01:07:26.917
No whores...

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:39.904
Howdy. Could I get a beer?

01:07:42.687 --> 01:07:45.054
- There you go.
- Much obliged.

01:07:45.056 --> 01:07:46.255
Hey, big fella?

01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:48.410
Yeah, why don't you come over here?

01:07:48.412 --> 01:07:49.910
I wanna talk to you.

01:07:49.912 --> 01:07:51.670
- Me?
- Yeah. Come on.

01:07:54.291 --> 01:07:55.291
Sit.

01:07:57.955 --> 01:08:00.026
- You've got yourself a drink?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:03.050
Alright, what's your name, big man?

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:05.390
Bud Rogers.

01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:08.157
- Bud Rogers.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:08.956
Waylon and Tully.

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.675
Were you ever in the army, bud?

01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:13.502
No, sir. I'm a farmer.

01:08:13.504 --> 01:08:15.139
- Farmer?
- Yes, sir.

01:08:15.141 --> 01:08:17.584
We're farmers, too. What's your crop?

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:19.330
- Corn, mostly.
- Ah, it don't matter.

01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:20.970
Do you got any reason to believe

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:23.046
there might be oil underneath that crop?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
- No, sir.
- No?

01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:29.688
Boy, you could be shitting in high cotton

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:30.800
and not even know it.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:34.550
My brother here could make
you a very, very rich man.

01:08:34.551 --> 01:08:35.354
That's right.

01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:36.475
- Go on.
- Sir?

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:39.853
He don't know what oil is, I reckon.

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.465
You know, it's neither here nor there.

01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:43.104
I want to put some money
in your pocket tonight.

01:08:43.106 --> 01:08:44.106
How's that sound?

01:08:45.944 --> 01:08:46.805
What do y'all want me to do?

01:08:46.808 --> 01:08:47.689
Yeah. Here's the deal.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:50.393
We're gonna go on a business transaction

01:08:50.395 --> 01:08:51.841
here with a complete stranger,

01:08:51.843 --> 01:08:55.850
and let's just say that
the stakes are high.

01:08:55.852 --> 01:08:57.358
Now what I want you to do

01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:00.814
is stand behind my brother Waylon here.

01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:01.968
You know, with a pistol.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.916
Why would I do that?

01:09:05.917 --> 01:09:07.836
Because you look mean.

01:09:08.913 --> 01:09:11.408
Do you want to earn a
little money tonight or not?

01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:14.216
Maybe, yeah.

01:09:14.218 --> 01:09:16.700
Yeah, this is, this is fine.

01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:17.745
I'm too drunk for this.

01:09:17.747 --> 01:09:19.174
I'm drunk as a fool now.

01:09:19.176 --> 01:09:20.969
And you're stout as a mule. You know?

01:09:21.796 --> 01:09:23.060
What I want you to do

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:27.240
is to stand behind Waylon
here with a pistol.

01:09:27.242 --> 01:09:28.725
Now, if everything goes well,

01:09:28.728 --> 01:09:31.478
we're gonna walk out of here
richer than what we came in.

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:32.955
We're gonna sell this dumb old horse.

01:09:32.957 --> 01:09:34.979
Of course, if it doesn't go well,

01:09:34.981 --> 01:09:37.281
I'm gonna shoot some asshole,

01:09:37.283 --> 01:09:39.457
take the next train to waco, I reckon.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.439
Either way, you'll make
$50 just to sit there

01:09:41.442 --> 01:09:43.537
all stupid with a pistol in your hand now.

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:49.095
- Alright. Sounds good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:49.098 --> 01:09:49.895
- Good man.
- No big deal.

01:09:49.897 --> 01:09:52.270
- Yes, sir.
- We do this all the time.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:55.512
Ain't nothing gonna happen.

01:09:55.514 --> 01:09:56.855
More than likely, he's legit.

01:09:56.857 --> 01:10:00.892
You just gotta be extra
cautious in this odd world.

01:10:00.894 --> 01:10:04.167
There's a lot of crooks out there.

01:10:05.248 --> 01:10:06.735
No honor among thieves.

01:10:07.598 --> 01:10:10.328
Exactly! Who said that?

01:10:12.019 --> 01:10:13.715
Now, who might you be?

01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:16.585
- Just a man.
- "Just a man."

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:19.191
Just a man looking for a horse.

01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:20.610
Oh, you sent the letter!

01:10:20.612 --> 01:10:21.972
Come on over here, boy.

01:10:21.974 --> 01:10:23.141
Been waiting on you.

01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:25.875
Get yourself a drink.

01:10:25.877 --> 01:10:27.131
No, thank you.

01:10:27.133 --> 01:10:28.628
Well, why don't you come a little closer

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.747
where we can get a look at you?

01:10:30.749 --> 01:10:31.804
You bring the horse?

01:10:32.677 --> 01:10:34.765
The letter said "sight unseen."

01:10:35.976 --> 01:10:37.249
No horse, no deal.

01:10:37.251 --> 01:10:38.048
Now, now, now, now wait a minute.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:40.762 --> 01:10:43.627
Now look, mister, I don't
even know what to call you,

01:10:43.629 --> 01:10:45.967
- first of all.
- Bain.

01:10:45.969 --> 01:10:48.844
- Bain?
- James Orville bain.

01:10:48.846 --> 01:10:52.628
Okay, Jim Orville bain. Some name.

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:55.034
You don't remember me, do you?

01:11:02.379 --> 01:11:04.213
- Tully?
- Huh?

01:11:04.215 --> 01:11:05.512
That's the old boy we robbed.

01:11:05.514 --> 01:11:06.514
Shut up, Waylon.

01:11:08.276 --> 01:11:11.478
This place serves the strongest shit

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.523
this side of Mississippi.

01:11:12.525 --> 01:11:14.307
I believe I'm seeing a ghost.

01:11:14.309 --> 01:11:15.309
No ghost.

01:11:16.716 --> 01:11:18.250
You robbed me outside that bank,

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:22.141
a saddle full of Mexican gold.

01:11:24.057 --> 01:11:25.902
Mexican gold, huh?

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:31.162
God damn it!

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:37.410
Why don't you tell me what it
is that you want, Jim bain?

01:11:37.412 --> 01:11:40.249
I want that gold you stole
from you, you son of a bitch.

01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:43.490
Major arliss beauregard's
gold that you stole?

01:11:43.492 --> 01:11:44.675
You killed him.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.516
I was just doing the lord's work.

01:11:48.518 --> 01:11:51.794
Beauregard is rotting in the
pits of hell right now, boy.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:52.764
And you're about to join him.

01:11:52.766 --> 01:11:55.171
You're a god danged traitor, bain.

01:11:55.173 --> 01:11:59.607
See, we needed men like you
to help fight for the cause.

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:06.794
You tucked tail and ran like
a bitch with a skinned knee.

01:12:09.864 --> 01:12:13.571
Waylon, the younger, weaker brother.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:15.985
There always is one, right?

01:12:16.963 --> 01:12:18.246
That war was over before it started,

01:12:18.248 --> 01:12:19.680
you stupid son of a bitch.

01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:23.070
It just took you hillbillies
about four years too late

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.086
to figure it out, that's all.

01:12:24.088 --> 01:12:26.213
Why you piece of shit.

01:12:26.215 --> 01:12:28.318
No!

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.550
You shot Waylon, you son of a bitch!

01:12:30.552 --> 01:12:33.825
Easy there, oilman, or you'll be next.

01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.464
Damn it! He shot me in the leg!

01:12:41.606 --> 01:12:42.701
If you don't get help right now,

01:12:42.703 --> 01:12:45.089
he'll bleed out and that's on your hands.

01:12:45.091 --> 01:12:46.672
I guarantee he won't be lonely.

01:12:46.674 --> 01:12:48.264
You'll burn for this, Jim bain.

01:12:48.266 --> 01:12:49.952
Maybe, maybe not.

01:12:49.954 --> 01:12:52.541
My company will send men for you.

01:12:52.543 --> 01:12:54.104
They will kill you.

01:12:54.106 --> 01:12:55.984
They'll kill all of you,

01:12:55.986 --> 01:12:58.880
and anyone in 50 miles who looks like you,

01:12:58.882 --> 01:13:01.010
and burn their god damned house down.

01:13:01.012 --> 01:13:04.390
With the wife and the kids
and the family dog inside.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:08.058
Before they kick you off a high tree,

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.689
you'll get to watch them take turns

01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:12.144
with that sweet Mexican wife of yours,

01:13:12.146 --> 01:13:14.441
over and over and over.

01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:19.750
Yeah, ain't like we
haven't already had a taste.

01:13:20.909 --> 01:13:21.909
No!

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.090
Waylon...

01:13:35.707 --> 01:13:37.122
$10,000?

01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:40.723
Plus interest, 1,000 a year.

01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:43.107
I don't have your gold, Jim bain.

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:48.002
All I've got for you is lead,
and I'm feeling generous.

01:13:49.807 --> 01:13:51.858
You want to finish this?

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.928
We do it in the street, like men.

01:13:56.428 --> 01:13:57.547
Let's do it.

01:14:10.853 --> 01:14:13.264
Why don't you call off your dogs?

01:14:13.266 --> 01:14:14.678
Make this a fair fight.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.811
Guess this ain't your day.

01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:50.623
How embarrassing,
you all dead in the street,

01:14:50.668 --> 01:14:53.323
and me going to have my way

01:14:53.325 --> 01:14:56.629
with that fiery little Mexican
bitch you were so fond of.

01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:01.398
Speak of the devil.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.951
Hands up.

01:15:02.953 --> 01:15:04.246
Now easy there, precious.

01:15:04.248 --> 01:15:05.661
Don't do nothing foolish.

01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:08.025
Lord have mercy.

01:15:08.027 --> 01:15:10.720
You know how to handle that big old gun?

01:15:10.722 --> 01:15:11.519
Don't worry about me.

01:15:11.521 --> 01:15:13.223
You worry about yourself.

01:15:13.225 --> 01:15:14.604
You're the one with it pointed at you.

01:15:14.606 --> 01:15:16.493
Now, let's be reasonable.

01:15:16.495 --> 01:15:19.054
We all came here to make a deal, right?

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.269
So let's make one. What do you say?

01:15:21.271 --> 01:15:24.539
- Deal?
- I'm a businessman.

01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:25.901
I'm sure we can find us a way

01:15:25.903 --> 01:15:29.694
that everybody walks out of
this mess alive, except him.

01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:32.432
Your husband killed my brother.

01:15:32.434 --> 01:15:35.290
Meeting his end was his own fault.

01:15:35.292 --> 01:15:39.529
I dare you to find a Texas
judge that'll say otherwise.

01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:42.047
My husband didn't call
you here to make a deal.

01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:44.483
He came here to kill you.

01:15:45.612 --> 01:15:46.612
But he didn't.

01:15:47.338 --> 01:15:49.997
You have $10,000 of Mexican
gold that belongs to him.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:53.186
He's gone, it should come to me.

01:15:53.188 --> 01:15:55.646
Is that right? Bless your heart.

01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:00.355
Okay. Don't get your
peppers in a wad, seniorita.

01:16:02.462 --> 01:16:04.877
Now my bank is a right
far piece from here.

01:16:04.879 --> 01:16:07.303
I'm afraid you will
have to accept a check.

01:16:07.305 --> 01:16:08.305
Cash.

01:16:09.252 --> 01:16:11.384
- Cash?
- Plus interest.

01:16:12.946 --> 01:16:16.773
What the hell
do you know about interest?

01:16:18.123 --> 01:16:22.063
Okay, interest, what do you think is fair?

01:16:22.065 --> 01:16:24.575
An extra $5,000.

01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:27.287
$5,000 seems a bit steep.

01:16:27.289 --> 01:16:31.121
$10,000, and I Bury you without a head.

01:16:32.144 --> 01:16:33.494
The extra five, I leave it where it is.

01:16:33.496 --> 01:16:36.271
Same goes for the man inside. Your choice.

01:16:37.198 --> 01:16:39.656
The former Mrs. Bain
drives a hell of a bargain.

01:16:43.672 --> 01:16:45.590
That's why I stopped arguing with her.

01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:52.847
Checkbook, get it out.

01:17:03.013 --> 01:17:04.372
Marisol, take it.

01:17:05.831 --> 01:17:07.510
What are you doing?

01:17:11.011 --> 01:17:14.032
You win, Jim bain. You win.

01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:20.710
Just get me the hell out of
Texas so I can Bury my brother.

01:17:21.305 --> 01:17:23.486
At least give me that.

01:17:23.488 --> 01:17:25.026
I'm just doing the lord's work.

01:17:31.294 --> 01:17:34.374
Oh god. You're hurt real bad.

01:17:34.376 --> 01:17:37.501
Bud, run out for a doctor. Oh...

01:17:37.503 --> 01:17:39.227
The check. Where the check?

01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:40.646
It's right here. Don't worry.

01:17:40.648 --> 01:17:41.855
Don't worry about that, okay?

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.255
Just stay with me.

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:44.545
Be still. Stay with me.

01:17:44.547 --> 01:17:46.320
Take his hand,

01:17:46.322 --> 01:17:48.588
take his hand and sign it.

01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:50.211
- Okay.
- Make him sign his name.

01:17:50.213 --> 01:17:51.727
Okay.

01:17:51.729 --> 01:17:55.923
I want you to cash that
before you go to Mexico.

01:17:55.925 --> 01:17:56.722
Jim, you're scaring me.

01:17:56.724 --> 01:17:58.679
Don't talk like that.
Don't talk like that.

01:17:58.681 --> 01:18:01.372
You're going to be
okay. Just stay with me.

01:18:01.374 --> 01:18:03.060
- Where are you?
- Stay with me.

01:18:03.062 --> 01:18:05.816
Jim? Jim?

01:18:07.243 --> 01:18:09.023
God damn, you're beautiful.

01:18:09.025 --> 01:18:10.624
You're so beautiful.

01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:15.617
Jim, stay. Jim...

01:18:20.425 --> 01:18:21.425
Jim!

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:25.079
Jim?

01:18:25.809 --> 01:18:26.809
Jim!

01:18:36.266 --> 01:18:37.063
Good morning.

01:18:37.065 --> 01:18:39.740
Well, I'm just stopping by to see you.

01:18:39.742 --> 01:18:41.277
You look lovely today.

01:18:41.279 --> 01:18:42.323
Thank you.

01:18:42.325 --> 01:18:44.902
I sure am going to miss
your smiling face around here.

01:18:44.904 --> 01:18:46.726
You're always kind, always a friend.

01:18:47.561 --> 01:18:50.102
Is there anything I can
do to convince you to stay?

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:54.354
No. Mexico is my new home.

01:18:55.406 --> 01:18:57.228
Maybe some day you can pay us a visit.

01:18:58.379 --> 01:19:01.136
Well, you tell Ramiro I
said "hello," would you?

01:19:01.138 --> 01:19:03.766
I will.

01:19:03.768 --> 01:19:05.320
Are you ready?

01:19:07.396 --> 01:19:08.396
I think so.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:10.789
I'll give you a moment.

01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:17.255
So how's the arm?

01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:19.269
Hurts like hell.

01:19:20.043 --> 01:19:22.089
The Mexican air ought
to do it some good.

01:19:23.077 --> 01:19:25.649
I always pictured old Jim bain dressed in

01:19:25.651 --> 01:19:27.699
one of those Mexican farmer suits.

01:19:29.499 --> 01:19:31.105
That'll be the day.

01:19:31.107 --> 01:19:32.638
That'll be something.

01:19:36.242 --> 01:19:37.999
Thank you for everything.

01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:42.047
You take care of that
woman. You hear me?

01:19:45.507 --> 01:19:48.702
If you ever decide to
donate any of that $15,000,

01:19:49.682 --> 01:19:52.538
I know an old, worn-out saloon
that could use some help.

01:19:55.413 --> 01:19:59.002
Huck, check the register.
