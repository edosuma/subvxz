20:38.853 --> 20:40.943
Gents, have a great fuckin' night.

20:42.657 --> 20:44.564
STEWY: Dmitri, how are you?

20:44.564 --> 20:47.199
Hey, Kendall. I'll find you, all right?

20:47.201 --> 20:49.500
<i>[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]</i>

20:49.502 --> 20:51.575
OK. This is it.

20:52.105 --> 20:53.972
Yeah? Cool, right?

20:53.974 --> 20:57.408
Is it cool, or is it, like,
total fucking bullshit?

20:57.410 --> 20:59.077
Well, what is it? What is it?

20:59.079 --> 21:01.112
It's a physical fun palace.

21:01.114 --> 21:03.548
It's basically, if you're into it,
and she's into it,

21:03.550 --> 21:04.749
it's all good.

21:04.751 --> 21:06.260
Look at this fucking guy with the bird mask

21:06.260 --> 21:07.359
like <i> Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

21:07.361 --> 21:08.893
GREG: Oh, wow. Eyes w...

21:09.109 --> 21:11.844
Wait, is this... is this gonna be an orgy?

21:12.046 --> 21:14.512
- ROMAN: No.
- This is not gonna be an orgy?

21:14.514 --> 21:17.583
Greg, it's not 1997.
It's not this, it's not that.

21:17.585 --> 21:19.585
Don't be so binary, Mr. Betamax.

21:19.587 --> 21:21.887
Is it gonna be
like a little bit of an orgy?

21:21.889 --> 21:23.922
It's basically
a collective of hot people...

21:23.924 --> 21:25.284
And Connor... At a party.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.292
And a monkey dressed as an astronaut,
apparently.

21:27.601 --> 21:29.834
It's whatever you want it to be.

21:29.836 --> 21:32.147
It's a fucking sand pit
for emergent behavior.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.414
OK, OK, holy shit. So... OK. OK.

21:34.416 --> 21:37.384
So, does that mean we're able to...
fuck here?

21:37.386 --> 21:40.152
Yeah. Hey, Ken,
what do you think of the pussycat? On it?

21:40.154 --> 21:43.088
No, not me. Business is my fucking.

21:43.531 --> 21:46.124
Great. I'll find you a Bloomberg
terminal to stick your dick in.

21:46.127 --> 21:48.928
CONNOR: Well, I'm out.
In a relationship. Girlfriend!

21:48.930 --> 21:51.363
TOM: I gotta say, Roman,
this is looking promising.

21:51.365 --> 21:52.598
This is looking really promising!

21:52.600 --> 21:54.700
ROMAN: See? Have a little faith.

21:54.702 --> 21:56.335
There's areas, though, right?

21:56.337 --> 21:58.704
Neutral areas in terms of not being,
you know,

21:58.706 --> 22:00.840
compulsory to do sex stuff?

22:00.842 --> 22:03.709

- Hey. What's up?

22:20.727 --> 22:22.280
Yeah, hey, what's happening?

22:23.137 --> 22:25.463
Here we are in a fuckin' warehouse

22:25.465 --> 22:28.433
- in Sunset Park or whatever.
- Yeah.

22:28.435 --> 22:30.168
I feel like this is synchronicity.

22:30.170 --> 22:33.039
Yeah?
Like the universe is telling us something.

22:33.915 --> 22:36.775
Yeah.
We really appreciated you coming to see us.

22:36.777 --> 22:38.143
Yeah, yeah, totally,

22:38.143 --> 22:39.368

22:40.581 --> 22:42.436
Yeah. Totally. Me too.

22:43.127 --> 22:46.618
OK, well, fuck, yeah. Excellent. All right.

22:46.620 --> 22:49.018
All right. Good to see you.

22:49.018 --> 22:50.072
Yeah.

22:55.706 --> 22:57.154
You know, I was thinking,

22:57.410 --> 22:59.097
maybe one wine, one water,

22:59.099 --> 23:00.984
as like an informal rule for the group?

23:01.334 --> 23:03.455
Also, uh, they have risotto balls.

Got you one.
Come on, man, it's goin' off tonight!

23:11.788 --> 23:13.588
We should talk to some girls.

23:13.613 --> 23:16.113
Little tip:
Ask 'em where they were on 9/11.

23:16.241 --> 23:18.607
If they don't know, they could be under 21.

23:19.303 --> 23:20.992
Well, Shiv gave me a hall pass.

23:21.246 --> 23:22.929
'Cause we're adults. Apparently.

23:22.929 --> 23:26.258
I'm gonna blow my load like multiple times.

23:27.157 --> 23:30.968
Wow. So...
And Shiv has that same arrangement?

23:30.970 --> 23:33.031
She's an adult too, so...

23:33.540 --> 23:35.440
What? No, no.

23:35.442 --> 23:36.974
Well, yeah, sure.

23:36.976 --> 23:39.243
I mean, I don't know, Greg.
It's not a competition.

23:39.245 --> 23:40.744
No, no, no. That's cool.

23:40.746 --> 23:42.136
I'm sure you guys have it all figured out.

23:42.325 --> 23:45.183
- CONNOR: Romey, what is this?
- Molly. Happy pills.

23:45.185 --> 23:47.318
- Oh, cool.
- But I wouldn't...

23:47.320 --> 23:48.919
No, no, no, no. Prague time.

23:48.921 --> 23:51.522
It's two in the morning for me.
I need a little pick-me-up.

23:51.524 --> 23:53.624
- Don't.
- Dude. I know my way around.

23:53.626 --> 23:56.060
1986, me, a Fleetwood Mac LP,

23:56.062 --> 23:57.861
and a bag of weed touched the face of God.

23:57.863 --> 24:00.530
Huh? The first of the evening,
the first of many.

24:00.532 --> 24:03.467
- Do not do any more of these.
- Got it. I'm one and done.

24:03.469 --> 24:05.168
Got a lot of shit cookin',

24:05.527 --> 24:08.806

24:08.808 --> 24:12.092
Yeah. Listen, man, about the vote,

24:12.437 --> 24:13.854
and your dad and us,

24:13.879 --> 24:16.513
I love you, man,
but you know I had to follow the money.

24:16.515 --> 24:17.755
You know that, right?

24:18.842 --> 24:20.017
I get it.

24:20.342 --> 24:22.820
All right. Hey,
why don't we talk in private for a second?

24:22.822 --> 24:24.680
- Can we do that?
- We can talk right here.

24:25.524 --> 24:26.546
All right.

24:27.510 --> 24:29.717
So listen, I have a question for you.

24:30.662 --> 24:32.899
How would you like to be all the way out?

24:33.384 --> 24:36.252
Half a bill for your share of Waystar.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.037
- Is this for real?
- Yeah, man.

24:41.301 --> 24:43.172
I'm feelin' fuckin' generous, that's all.

24:43.174 --> 24:45.574
And I've plumped the pillows
and added a little premium.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.719
- Consisting of what?
- Straight liquid.

24:47.988 --> 24:49.388
- Bullshit.
- Don't you worry about it.

24:49.390 --> 24:50.555
I can raise it.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.157
Why would you want to be even more in?

24:52.561 --> 24:54.492
The place is a fucking antique shop.

24:54.495 --> 24:56.745
Ken, just take the money and get out.
Please.

24:59.849 --> 25:00.786
I mean...

25:03.017 --> 25:04.974
it's not uninteresting.

25:05.119 --> 25:07.286
Fantastic. Great. So listen,

25:07.288 --> 25:08.534
there's a part two to this.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.523
Why don't we talk this over with Sandy?

25:11.525 --> 25:13.488
Sandy... Furness?

25:13.928 --> 25:15.073
Come with me.

25:15.215 --> 25:16.242
Come.

25:17.031 --> 25:18.176
TOM: Bottom's up.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.201
- One, two, three!
- Ketamine.

25:23.905 --> 25:26.638
- You good?
- Line 'em up, please.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.790
These bathrobes are nice.

25:29.610 --> 25:31.868
- See these?
- Uh-huh.

25:32.238 --> 25:34.071
What's your table linen philosophy?

25:34.478 --> 25:37.541
Uh, my philosophy is I
literally don't give a fuck.

25:37.543 --> 25:40.344
So what's that, Nietzsche?

25:40.978 --> 25:41.979
These are what's

25:41.981 --> 25:43.681
on our registry.

25:43.683 --> 25:44.749
Hmm.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.483
You should go for these.

25:47.704 --> 25:49.584
Right, you want us
to have matching cutlery?

25:49.953 --> 25:51.107
Why not?

25:51.819 --> 25:55.292
It'll be sort of horrible, and cute.

25:56.829 --> 25:59.523
So when we both get divorced

25:59.548 --> 26:01.435
and split all our stuff,

26:01.679 --> 26:03.577
we can hook up and have the same set.

26:04.221 --> 26:06.192
- The full set.
- Mm-hmm.

26:06.438 --> 26:08.016
[KISSING] Yeah.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.474
Nah-hah-hah.

26:11.783 --> 26:13.350
You know this is just fun, right?

26:14.625 --> 26:16.700
- I know, it's just...
- It's nothing.

26:17.344 --> 26:19.723
I mean, it's not anything. There's no God,

26:19.725 --> 26:21.758
there's no... anything,

26:21.760 --> 26:24.161
there's just people in rooms

26:24.163 --> 26:25.428
trying to be happy.

26:25.747 --> 26:27.264
- Right?
- Right.

26:30.903 --> 26:33.297
Oh, and I suggested to Gil

26:33.322 --> 26:34.962
that he cool off

26:35.806 --> 26:38.201
on the anti-Waystar agenda on ATN tonight.

26:38.201 --> 26:39.835
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.356
I talked to him at the thing.

26:41.605 --> 26:43.038
Oh. OK.

26:43.183 --> 26:45.306
Well, I did spend quite some time

26:45.331 --> 26:48.179
on how it'd be very vivid to attack Waystar

26:48.204 --> 26:49.988
- on a Waystar network, but...
- Very vivid?

26:50.261 --> 26:53.564
It's played out.
Makes it look like we have an agenda.

26:54.098 --> 26:55.998
Uh, we do. Stopping

26:56.000 --> 26:57.400
overly mighty media owners

26:57.402 --> 26:59.185
setting the agenda for our democracy.

26:59.637 --> 27:02.516
DOJ, FCC, Batman,

27:02.541 --> 27:04.820
to stop your dad eating the news.

27:04.845 --> 27:06.778
OK, but even if we're going for that,

27:07.136 --> 27:09.603
isn't that in some big
speech that no one reads?

27:10.073 --> 27:13.324
Can't he just connect to America
tonight and forget the base?

27:13.324 --> 27:16.959
Shiv, I appreciate you might
have split loyalties on this.

27:16.962 --> 27:18.461
Fuck you. I'm just trying to make him win.

27:18.463 --> 27:20.395
I don't think he can do both at once.

27:20.397 --> 27:23.665
I don't think Gil can do
the base and the rest.

27:24.535 --> 27:26.409
Well, if he can't ride two horses at once,

27:26.409 --> 27:27.962
he shouldn't be working at the circus.

27:30.875 --> 27:34.276
- Sandy comes to these?
- Oh, yeah. He loves sex.

27:34.608 --> 27:37.916
Dude, the thing that he pees through,

27:37.916 --> 27:39.515
he puts into other people.

27:39.517 --> 27:41.072
It's fucking vile. And a lot.

27:41.072 --> 27:42.238
Hey, Sandy.

27:42.857 --> 27:44.637
Oh. Gents, excuse me.

27:48.363 --> 27:50.459
- Kendall. You look well.
- Thank you.

27:50.459 --> 27:53.059
You look, uh, out of place.

27:53.061 --> 27:55.328
I do like to see the youngsters frolic.

27:55.330 --> 27:56.980
So, you wanna talk?

27:57.293 --> 28:00.125
Uh, did Stewy fill you in?

28:02.962 --> 28:04.736
Why do I feel like I'm about to find out

28:04.736 --> 28:07.416
you're not my real mommy
and daddy after all?

28:07.739 --> 28:08.995
Look, the truth is,

28:09.341 --> 28:11.198
he wants your piece of pie,

28:11.577 --> 28:15.245
but... and please don't
fucking blow a fuse here, OK?

28:16.715 --> 28:19.758
The reality is, he's already in on Waystar.

28:20.427 --> 28:22.996
- As in?
- As in Sandy's me,

28:22.996 --> 28:24.328
and I'm Sandy.

28:24.691 --> 28:26.445
We're like a single entity.

28:26.693 --> 28:28.664
Like a creature from mythology.

28:28.664 --> 28:31.148
You know, head of a horse, dick of a swan.

28:32.136 --> 28:34.834
Stewy... seriously?

28:34.834 --> 28:37.345
I have a shell company attached

28:37.370 --> 28:39.718
to his private equity fund.

28:41.007 --> 28:43.157
I'm a parasite on a parasite.

28:47.754 --> 28:50.020
You should have disclosed that
to me when I brought you in.

28:50.045 --> 28:52.189
You are one hundred percent
correct about that.

28:52.214 --> 28:53.305
I should have done that.

28:53.305 --> 28:54.804
You were in a tough position

28:55.044 --> 28:58.941
without having to consider whether your dad

28:58.943 --> 29:00.763
would want me involved.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.856
He very much would not.

29:04.919 --> 29:08.120
So apparently,
my girlfriend's having a panic attack.

29:08.122 --> 29:11.229
I'm gonna let you two just catch up now.
Cool?

29:14.122 --> 29:16.137
Stewy tells me you're getting into tech.

29:16.564 --> 29:17.763
Yeah, I have a fund.

29:17.764 --> 29:20.199
We're niche, but we're engaged.

29:20.557 --> 29:22.334
Just closed a deal tonight, actually.

29:22.336 --> 29:25.066
And I found these four Stanford grads

29:25.091 --> 29:27.190
<i>who are doing this thing, it's pretty cool,</i>

29:27.192 --> 29:29.318
they have this cluster of hydrogen lamps...

29:29.319 --> 29:30.754
Wait. What's going on?

29:30.854 --> 29:32.187
Dude, are you pitching? You just pitch?

29:32.189 --> 29:33.821
Where'd you spring from, Heidi?

29:33.823 --> 29:35.726
Don't stop. I want to hear the pitch.
I might invest.

29:35.949 --> 29:38.455
KENDALL: <i>[LAUGHS]</i> <i>We were just talking.</i>

29:38.762 --> 29:40.518
To him? The enemy?

29:40.520 --> 29:42.754
The adults are talking.
How about you go play in the other room?

29:42.756 --> 29:45.590
Hey, Sandy, could I maybe get
a moment with you in private?

29:45.592 --> 29:48.626
I'd like to talk to you about
how attached you're feeling

29:48.628 --> 29:51.162
to your 50 failing local TV stations.

29:51.929 --> 29:54.220
Sure. I'm sure we could find a time.

29:54.282 --> 29:57.868
Roman, could you maybe back off for,
like, 20 minutes?

29:57.868 --> 29:59.099
- No.
- Yeah. Get us a drink?

29:59.100 --> 30:01.167
I would love another old-fashioned.

30:01.169 --> 30:03.336
He would love another old-fashioned,
cliché that he is.

30:03.338 --> 30:04.871
No, that's not gonna happen.

30:04.873 --> 30:06.827
I know that you and my dad

30:06.852 --> 30:10.009
have been deeply and madly
in hate with each other,

30:10.011 --> 30:11.577
and you have been for many years,

30:12.008 --> 30:13.546
but I want you to know
that I'm my own thing,

40:11.608 --> 40:14.256
So if you want to stop me,

40:14.686 --> 40:15.972
be my guest.

40:16.851 --> 40:18.383
I don't do <i> white</i> drugs.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.010
My dad's gonna be super-disappointed

40:21.040 --> 40:22.459
if his son ODs.

40:22.459 --> 40:24.143
- I know.
- So...?

40:34.017 --> 40:35.220
What the fuck?

40:35.662 --> 40:37.329
He's counting on you to look after me.

40:40.376 --> 40:42.201
OK, OK, OK! Stop. Stop.

40:42.505 --> 40:43.936
OK. Give it to me.

40:48.056 --> 40:49.375
- Go on.
- I'm goin'.

TOM: <i>Ooh, Greg!</i>

40:51.178 --> 40:53.045
Go for it, Greg!

[LAUGHING]

41:21.593 --> 41:22.757
Should I puke?

41:22.782 --> 41:25.432
Not unless you can puke up
your entire bloodstream.

41:27.219 --> 41:29.887
- Oh, my God, man.
- That is strong drugs.

- I know. I hope you don't die.
- Oh, my God!

41:32.391 --> 41:34.892
If you do,
your heart is gonna be pumping so hard

41:34.894 --> 41:36.801
it'll probably bring you back to life.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.910
- Where did he go?
- Buckle up, fucklehead!

- SHIV: Hello.

42:08.611 --> 42:11.854
- I'm glad you kept the date.
- Well, family.

42:14.166 --> 42:16.562
- How was the play?
- Oh, you know,

people pretending to be people.

42:18.842 --> 42:19.974
[LAUGHS]

42:20.467 --> 42:22.213
How are the wedding arrangements?

42:22.978 --> 42:24.241
Very exciting.

42:24.413 --> 42:26.692
Yeah, well, I'm excited. My daughter.

42:27.344 --> 42:28.725
So you saw the interview.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.618
They told me.

42:31.331 --> 42:32.906
You came after the man's wife.

42:34.524 --> 42:35.574
They said.

42:36.110 --> 42:37.398
You're OK with that?

42:38.406 --> 42:41.035
Tell him not to speak about my family,

42:41.035 --> 42:42.501
not on my network...

42:43.038 --> 42:45.352
not on <i> any</i> network, ever again.

42:46.167 --> 42:47.485
Or I'll end him.

42:48.227 --> 42:50.492
Yeah, silence the man who
says you're stifling dissent.

42:50.899 --> 42:53.495
I'm a bad father? How dare he.

42:54.079 --> 42:56.693
He's a bad fuckin' husband.
He killed his wife.

42:56.789 --> 42:59.039
Oh, come on. Dad.

42:59.443 --> 43:01.068
What if the acquisitions you're making

43:01.068 --> 43:02.630
are actually bad for the country?

43:03.104 --> 43:05.140
He's using you. Can't you see it?

43:05.640 --> 43:09.094
Don't let any of the bullshit
overshadow your wedding.

43:09.409 --> 43:10.627
The wedding?

43:10.715 --> 43:12.344
The fucking wedding? I don't give a shit.

43:12.346 --> 43:14.311
Oh, Siobhan, come on. Stop screwing around.

43:15.776 --> 43:17.713
I want to talk about you properly.

43:17.967 --> 43:21.244
Come in. I'm tired of this.

43:22.341 --> 43:23.476
You have potential.

43:24.076 --> 43:26.941
I've always thought you were the smartest.

43:27.414 --> 43:29.712
So that's why you tried
Kendall and Roman first?

43:31.528 --> 43:33.810
Do you know what? I <i> am</i> the smartest.

43:34.877 --> 43:36.777
Which is why I can see through you

43:36.778 --> 43:38.724
and this transparent
little offer to buy me off.

43:39.347 --> 43:41.851
I've always tried to do right by you,
Siobhan.

43:42.307 --> 43:43.391
And maybe...

43:44.846 --> 43:46.115
maybe I shouldn't have.

43:47.311 --> 43:49.478
Maybe I should just let them come for you.

43:50.235 --> 43:51.256
Like who?

43:51.281 --> 43:53.915
Like... I don't know.

43:55.486 --> 43:56.953
But I hear things.

44:01.150 --> 44:02.557
Are you threatening me?

44:03.377 --> 44:04.864
Absolutely not.

44:04.995 --> 44:07.329
If this is the way things are gonna go,
then fuck off, Dad.

44:07.619 --> 44:10.632
Then... I'm truly sorry.

44:20.111 --> 44:21.777
So, in terms of Shiv,

44:21.779 --> 44:23.846
where I've landed is, uh,

44:23.848 --> 44:25.580
I'm maybe just gonna ask for a handy.

44:25.582 --> 44:28.178
- Think that's OK?
- Don't pre-rationalize.

44:28.203 --> 44:30.753
You get off, you eat the shame for dessert.

44:35.975 --> 44:38.159
- Wait. Her? That one?
- Yeah. We were talking

44:38.161 --> 44:40.394
for, like,
20 minutes about financial derivatives,

44:40.396 --> 44:41.763
and she just asked me.

44:41.765 --> 44:43.397
My God! Holy shit!

44:43.399 --> 44:45.867
Dad would go fuckin' nuts for her.
You should do it.

44:45.869 --> 44:47.334
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Fuck yeah!

44:47.336 --> 44:48.535
I'd be all over that.

44:48.537 --> 44:51.398
I'd, like... I'd fuckin'...

44:52.475 --> 44:54.258
Arrgh! Fuck.

44:55.426 --> 44:56.578
OK, well...

44:58.737 --> 45:00.458
I need something. Do you have a Smint?

45:00.784 --> 45:02.116
- What?
- Do you have a Smint?

45:02.118 --> 45:04.886
No! Just grab your baloney-pipe and jizz.

45:08.466 --> 45:10.575
- OK. OK.
- Yeah. OK.

That's where the real fuckin' money...

45:34.316 --> 45:36.449
Do you think now would be a good
time to sit down with the old fart?

45:36.451 --> 45:39.985
Dude, did you see that guy jerking
off near the hors d'oeuvres?

45:39.987 --> 45:41.987
Dude, that's a fuckin' health hazard.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.156
Uh, no.
When do you think I <i> can</i> talk to him?

45:44.158 --> 45:46.125
I'd really love to hear
something to take home.

45:46.127 --> 45:48.694
Uh-huh.
Ro-Ro, can you just be fucking cool, man?

45:48.696 --> 45:50.429
Maybe get a slider.

45:50.431 --> 45:53.199
Ask if can stick your finger up
someone's ass, all right, buddy?

45:54.336 --> 45:56.435
- Jeez.
- Hey! Fuck you!

45:56.852 --> 45:59.037
I'm not your little pet
that you get to kick around.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.670
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me, space suit.

46:01.701 --> 46:02.741
Bro.

46:02.743 --> 46:04.376
You think that I can't
make your life difficult,

46:04.378 --> 46:05.845
but word in the right ear,

46:05.847 --> 46:07.546
and I could be your migraine, motherfucker.

46:07.892 --> 46:10.620
I came here to talk to
the old man on your word,

46:10.620 --> 46:11.690
so make it happen.

46:12.588 --> 46:13.920
- OK.
- Yeah?

46:13.945 --> 46:15.313
- All right.
- Cool.

46:19.670 --> 46:20.742
Ahh!

46:23.298 --> 46:26.266
I tried to hide... but it finds you.

46:26.733 --> 46:28.702
Wherever you hide, the party finds you.

46:31.126 --> 46:32.839
Sir, this is your final warning.

46:33.407 --> 46:34.477
Absolutely.

46:34.610 --> 46:35.660
Got it.

46:35.778 --> 46:36.877
Wait. What's happening?

46:36.879 --> 46:38.279
Your friend here

46:38.281 --> 46:40.114
keeps telling people
he's in love with them,

46:40.116 --> 46:41.649
<i>and it's making people uncomfortable.</i>

46:41.651 --> 46:43.317
My bad. Mixed messages.

46:43.319 --> 46:47.107
It's just we share such strong
feelings about gut bacteria

46:48.183 --> 46:50.033
I think I got the wrong end of the stick.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.167
Watch him.

46:54.033 --> 46:55.430
Maybe I should go apologize.

46:55.897 --> 46:56.951
Give her a hug.

46:58.500 --> 47:00.051
Oh, my God, dude!

47:00.302 --> 47:01.857
That was insane!

47:01.857 --> 47:03.923
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Me and this girl,

47:03.948 --> 47:06.735
we go into this side room
and we start making out,

47:06.951 --> 47:08.418
and then I'm touching her

47:08.420 --> 47:10.019
and then she goes down on me,

47:10.412 --> 47:12.981
and then I splooge in her mouth, and...

47:13.006 --> 47:14.172
I know! I know!

47:14.197 --> 47:16.004
And get this: she kisses me

47:16.004 --> 47:18.530
and puts it back in my mouth,
and I <i> swallow.</i>

47:19.846 --> 47:21.149
Which, the cum?

47:21.149 --> 47:23.315
I know. So hot!

47:23.708 --> 47:25.218
You swallowed your own load?

47:25.562 --> 47:27.019
Yeah. I heard of it, but I don't...

47:27.021 --> 47:29.087
I didn't know it actually happened.

47:29.489 --> 47:30.688
I haven't heard about it before.

47:30.690 --> 47:32.891
I have. It's a thing.
There's a word for it.

47:32.893 --> 47:35.229
I can't remember what it is right now.

47:36.196 --> 47:38.397
- Hmm.
- So fuckin' hot.

47:42.811 --> 47:44.370
When are we allowed to go home?

47:44.371 --> 47:45.722
We have cars at 5:00.

47:48.727 --> 47:50.875
Greg, I'm having the time of my life.

47:51.178 --> 47:52.677
This is nightmarish.

48:03.697 --> 48:05.634
You ready for your bachelorette party?

48:06.467 --> 48:08.036
They were out of marine uniforms,

48:08.061 --> 48:10.659
so I've come dressed as
a political consultant.

48:12.284 --> 48:13.683
Sss...

48:19.370 --> 48:20.502
Relax.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.282
This isn't real.

48:25.033 --> 48:28.235
It's becoming real,
which might be a problem for us.

48:32.726 --> 48:35.340
Uh... can I stay?

48:37.046 --> 48:39.046
But with you, as a human dog

48:39.048 --> 48:40.437
just at the foot of the bed?

48:42.370 --> 48:43.728
I love you, Kenny.

48:46.717 --> 48:48.821
- I love you too, man.
- I'm tryin' to find this girl,

48:48.823 --> 48:50.557
but I think she's trying to hide from me.

48:50.559 --> 48:52.925
Listen, is there another room for humping?

48:52.927 --> 48:54.282
'Cause I also lost Roman.

48:54.904 --> 48:56.929
- Fuck Roman.
- Well, you know,

48:56.931 --> 48:59.031
he was askin' about the dog pound,

48:59.033 --> 49:00.455
and he got kind of riled up.

49:00.568 --> 49:01.934
Is he still talking about that?

49:01.936 --> 49:02.921
Yeah.

49:03.071 --> 49:04.739
- It's pathetic.
- Yeah.

49:04.764 --> 49:05.930
He enjoyed it, right?

49:06.474 --> 49:07.613
Oh, yeah!

49:07.649 --> 49:08.881
I mean, you did too.

49:09.185 --> 49:11.085
You know, just messin' around.

49:11.087 --> 49:12.248
Yeah, just messin' around.

49:12.248 --> 49:14.645
Dad's theory was you got two fighting dogs,

49:14.858 --> 49:16.275
you send the weak one away,

49:16.275 --> 49:17.375
you punish the weak one.

49:17.376 --> 49:19.175
Then everyone knows the hierarchy,

49:19.177 --> 49:20.260
then everyone's happy.

49:20.261 --> 49:21.737
So away he went.

49:22.390 --> 49:23.784
I gotta keep lookin'. OK.

49:24.025 --> 49:26.625
Hi! Hey, may I ask you,

49:26.627 --> 49:28.260
where were you on 9/11?

49:28.262 --> 49:31.013
You know what, I... Never mind.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.137
Listen, Sandy.

49:39.340 --> 49:41.888
I appreciate your offer.
I'm not getting out.

49:44.871 --> 49:48.203
OK. Well, if you think you have to tell

49:48.228 --> 49:50.149
your father and get back in with him,

49:50.151 --> 49:51.494
- then I...
- Keep your money.

49:53.921 --> 49:55.582
Keep your money, bring me in.

49:56.519 --> 49:57.861
We do this properly.

49:58.112 --> 49:59.616
We'll go fuck my dad together.

- Uh-huh.
- Takeover.

50:03.391 --> 50:05.098
Leveraged buyout. Hostile.

50:05.752 --> 50:07.452
That's a dual stock situation.

50:07.454 --> 50:09.186
That's not gonna be straightforward.

50:09.188 --> 50:11.900
Price in the toilet,
shareholders are pissed...

50:13.093 --> 50:14.775
You and me could force him to the table.

50:16.780 --> 50:18.085
What about the rest of your family?

50:18.085 --> 50:19.323
Fuck the rest of my family.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.637
- Easy to say.
- No one has a clue but me.

50:23.136 --> 50:24.678
I know what to do. I see it all.

50:25.944 --> 50:27.152
We take it apart.

50:27.396 --> 50:30.792

We bulldoze the whole fuckin' shantytown.

50:34.619 --> 50:36.419
We just keep the juiciest morsels,

50:36.782 --> 50:38.582
turn the thing from a pod of rotting whales

50:38.584 --> 50:40.026
into one bastard great white.

50:40.984 --> 50:42.118
What's your end?

50:42.634 --> 50:46.066

knows the architecture.

50:46.407 --> 50:49.192
OK? The emotional corporate architecture.

50:49.194 --> 50:52.176
Well, I could like it.
Stewy might not like it.

50:52.176 --> 50:53.267
Fuck Stewy.

50:53.711 --> 50:56.545
Stewy will follow the money
like a dog in a cartoon.

50:56.739 --> 50:58.454
And you sure you got the stomach?

50:59.416 --> 51:00.469
Yeah.

but I don't think it's a good idea
for him to come to the wedding.

51:54.482 --> 51:56.132
Oh, yeah. That sounds sensible.

51:56.207 --> 51:57.139
<i>Shiv.</i>

51:59.429 --> 52:00.928
He really <i> is</i> sorry.

52:03.347 --> 52:04.430
Yeah, me too.

52:05.544 --> 52:07.320
OK, bye.

52:13.888 --> 52:15.006
You OK?

52:16.426 --> 52:19.293
Yeah. I'm great.
That's two less wedding dinners

52:19.318 --> 52:20.822
for the caterers to have to organize.

52:25.481 --> 52:26.533
[GRUNTS]

52:32.192 --> 52:33.313
I don't know, Nate.

52:37.267 --> 52:38.484
I don't fuckin' know.

52:49.090 --> 52:51.090
ROMAN:
And I would be your point man on this,

52:51.090 --> 52:53.186
so you would not have to
deal direct with my dad.

52:53.525 --> 52:56.354
So if we can find a price...

52:59.061 --> 53:01.357
- But there's potential?
- It could happen.

53:02.534 --> 53:03.972
Well, fuck, I'm excited.

53:04.023 --> 53:06.616
This is great. This is pure upside.

53:06.641 --> 53:08.341
- ROMAN: Thank you.
- Awesome, dude.

53:09.838 --> 53:11.578
Let's jerk him around for a bit,

53:11.580 --> 53:13.183
then throw him back.

53:14.769 --> 53:16.514
This fuckin' family.

53:17.716 --> 53:19.383
Ooh, hey! Come on.

53:19.978 --> 53:21.107
How's it goin'?

53:28.908 --> 53:29.878
What?

53:33.851 --> 53:35.646
What, are you psyching me out?

53:44.011 --> 53:45.076
[CLANK]

53:45.646 --> 53:47.145
I'm fuckin' terrified.

53:49.216 --> 53:50.244
Asshole!

53:54.422 --> 53:55.445
Shit.

53:55.986 --> 53:57.689
If the car doesn't come soon,

53:57.691 --> 53:59.051
I'm just gonna swim home, I think.

53:59.762 --> 54:01.920
Greg tells me you swallowed your own load.

54:03.284 --> 54:06.321
Yeah, It was... Yeah. It was pretty wild.

54:07.742 --> 54:09.695
It's cool, though,
'cause it's like I didn't cheat

54:09.852 --> 54:11.903
'cause all the sperm stayed in my own body.

54:11.905 --> 54:13.787
Like a closed loop system. So...

54:15.803 --> 54:17.018
It'd be really nice to see Shiv.

54:17.043 --> 54:20.018
Willa! Hi, I just want to say I love you.

54:20.364 --> 54:21.561
I love you so much.

54:21.848 --> 54:23.648
What's happening? Where's the car?

54:23.650 --> 54:24.848
Arriving in five.

54:25.318 --> 54:26.651
Congratulations, Tom.

54:26.934 --> 54:28.759
I hear you swallowed your own load.

54:30.474 --> 54:31.556
Yeah, I did.

54:31.558 --> 54:33.037
It's been a really wonderful night.

54:34.385 --> 54:36.526
I would love a chicken pot pie.

54:36.528 --> 54:37.516
Thank you.

54:37.763 --> 54:39.099
OK, honey, bye.

54:52.619 --> 54:54.101
Hey, Shiv!

54:54.613 --> 54:55.727
I'm home!

54:56.032 --> 54:57.713
Still got both my eyebrows!

54:57.716 --> 54:59.315
- Oh, hi!
- Hey.

54:59.317 --> 55:01.501
Hey, you're back... already.

55:02.426 --> 55:05.455
God, I missed you, honey.
God, I missed you.

55:06.099 --> 55:07.923
- I missed you.
- How was it?

55:08.191 --> 55:10.066
- Which... Oh, the party?
- Yeah.

55:10.091 --> 55:11.239
It was a blast.

55:11.462 --> 55:12.751
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:12.751 --> 55:15.779
So... what happened?

55:17.646 --> 55:19.456
[LAUGHS] You know, just...

55:20.033 --> 55:21.541
like, this and that.

55:22.188 --> 55:23.414
Usual. Normal stuff.

55:23.439 --> 55:25.023
Specifically what, Tom?

55:29.290 --> 55:31.196
Wait, what? No. Shiv, you...

55:31.697 --> 55:32.736
I thought you said...

55:33.938 --> 55:35.405
Oh, honey, I'm shitting you.

55:35.407 --> 55:36.739
Oh, my God, OK.

55:36.741 --> 55:38.341
[BOTH LAUGH]

55:38.963 --> 55:40.402
Oh, it's good to have you back.

55:51.755 --> 55:52.949
Yeah, Frank.

55:53.746 --> 55:55.180
Those girls from the art thing,

55:55.600 --> 55:58.001
I want you to put the word
around they're junkies,

55:58.453 --> 56:01.186
they're sluts,
they're shooting seed capital

56:01.188 --> 56:02.482
straight into their arms.

56:03.258 --> 56:04.294
Let's sink them.
