00:43.877 --> 00:47.089
-Here they are, sir.
-Okay. thank you.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.530
New York pays tribute

01:11.572 --> 01:15.450
to the american foot soldier,
as the 82nd Airborne division,

01:15.492 --> 01:17.828
led by its youthful commander,
Major General Gavin,

01:17.828 --> 01:20.330
marches up Fifth Avenue.

01:20.372 --> 01:25.586
Gliders fly overhead as
the City Roars its welcome home

01:25.627 --> 01:28.672
to the 13,000 veterans
who fought from Sicily and Italy

01:28.672 --> 01:32.342
through Normandy,
Holland, and Germany.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.553
...Four million New Yorkers

01:34.595 --> 01:38.724
lined the four-and-a-half-mile
parade route to greet the men.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.735
Oh, Hanna, I didn't know
there would be a newsreel.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.403
Oh, it's not your fault.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.697
Silly me, I...
I just, uh...

01:54.865 --> 01:56.158
Here.

02:01.413 --> 02:05.876
-I just miss him.
-Of course you do.

02:05.876 --> 02:10.506
Seeing all those soldiers coming
home, I just... It breaks me up.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.258
'course it does.
He's your husband.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.885
"Was."

02:14.885 --> 02:18.639
Aw, Hanna, honey.
He's still your husband.

02:18.680 --> 02:23.477
Nothing changes that.
Well, you know what I mean.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.271
He's still in your heart,
and you're always gonna be...

02:26.313 --> 02:28.398
I'm just making it
worse now, aren't I? Oh...

02:29.483 --> 02:34.530
Go on and blow.
I've got another one in here. Oh...

02:34.571 --> 02:37.199
Look at me, blubbering on.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.368
And when all our boys
are over there,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.787
doing something heroic
for the world.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.872
Go on and have a good cry.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.333
Not everyone's born
to change the world.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.211
Yeah, well,
nothing ever got solved

02:49.253 --> 02:51.255
by blubbering on the sidewalk
either.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.884
I just wanted to make
a happy home for my husband.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.931
And now I...
I don't have any purpose at all.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.810
Well... you can walk me
to the square.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.800
That's not exactly a purpose.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.278
You never know. Even the smallest
stone makes a ripple in the water.

03:15.904 --> 03:19.241
-What stone?
-It's a saying.

03:19.283 --> 03:23.452
Come on,
they're decorating the gazebo.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.636
Good evening, Mr. McGregor.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.681
How's that shoulder
holding up these days?

03:42.723 --> 03:45.017
Ah, you know,
the old rheumatism acts up

03:45.058 --> 03:46.476
when there's a storm coming.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.938
And I can tell there's a doozy
coming in tomorrow.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.274
Well, that's what
everyone's been saying.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.483
It's a shame, too.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.943
Cloud cover is going
to hide the comet.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.904
Oh, darn.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.906
I was looking forward
to seeing it.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.325
I... I didn't think of that.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.745
But a big snow storm, it's a good night
to nestle in, I guess.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.788
And how are you holding up?

04:06.830 --> 04:09.833
Oh, don't you go
worrying about me.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.668
Someone's got to, nurse Hanna.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.504
You're always taking care
of the rest of us.

04:15.047 --> 04:19.801
You'll come to the caroling?
Oh. Well, I suppose so.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.387
Yes, I always like seeing
the whole town come out for it.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.640
Let's just hope
the snow holds off.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.464
Julia!
You got engaged?

04:57.506 --> 05:00.008
Just now!
I'm the first to know?

05:00.050 --> 05:02.469
Well, of course, you were
the one who introduced us.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.805
Without you, we never would have..
Oh, Julia! When?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.640
Come. Frank's just bursting
to tell you himself.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.353
...And I told myself, why wait?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.730
As soon as I can carry her
over the threshold,

05:13.730 --> 05:15.858
we're gonna find the closest
justice of the peace.

05:15.899 --> 05:16.859
Right, honey?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.902
Engaged on the night
of the Christmas comet.

05:18.902 --> 05:19.778
How romantic.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.906
Well, look this way,
you two lovebirds.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.579
And I'm gonna find her
a white dress

05:28.620 --> 05:31.123
just like one I saw in a window
when I was over there in Italy.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.500
Prettiest dress I ever saw.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.919
Frank has been telling me all about
Italy, the good parts anyway.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.756
He says there's hundred-year-old
churches and cobblestone streets...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.925
Pretty as a picture,
some of those towns,

05:41.925 --> 05:45.596
but, uh, nothing beats
being back home.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.519
Well, I should be
getting back to work.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.939
Congratulations, you two.
I'm so happy for you.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.611
Hanna?

06:02.738 --> 06:03.947
I wasn't even thinking.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.782
We were so giddy,
and I didn't even--

06:05.824 --> 06:08.452
Oh, no, don't apologize, Julia.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.787
We have to keep our eyes
focused on tomorrow, right?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.123
That's where happiness is,
not the past.

06:13.165 --> 06:17.544
-You are such brave thing.
-Oh, I'm not so brave.

06:17.586 --> 06:21.131
I'm just happy you're so happy.
Really.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.383
And we are happy.
Thanks to you.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.000
Comin' through!

06:29.932 --> 06:31.475
Hey, uh, we're
decorating the tree.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.809
You going to come by?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.521
Oh. oh, maybe later,
after my rounds.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.147
Say, while you're down there,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.149
do you mind replacing the key
to the storage locker?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.776
I forgot to hang it back up.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.736
It's right here in my jacket pocket.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.906
You're a peach.
I gotta run.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.659
They're waiting for the decorations.
Oh, careful!

06:48.659 --> 06:51.119
Uh, see you later?
Say yes.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.496
We're all going to have
a little celebration

06:52.538 --> 06:53.830
before heading over to the gazebo.

06:53.872 --> 06:54.831
Okay.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.584
"...on the left side of her,

06:57.626 --> 07:00.003
"she presently spied
a little wooden hut

07:00.003 --> 07:02.965
"painted blue,
and something rose-colored

07:03.006 --> 07:06.885
"was tied to the handle
of its shut blue door.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.514
"'a bunch of roses,'
said the fairy godmother,

07:10.556 --> 07:15.060
"and she thought of going over
and smelling their sweetness,

07:15.102 --> 07:16.603
but when she came close to it..."

07:18.689 --> 07:20.691
You don't want me
to read to you anymore?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.653
Are you sad, Toby?

07:24.695 --> 07:26.905
I don't want to go back
to the orphanage.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.786
I bet you don't know
what's coming tonight.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.872
Do too.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.916
Oh, yeah? What?
The comet.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.000
You are so right.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.172
Is the comet a miracle?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.717
Hmm.
Well, that's a good question.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.845
What's the difference
between a miracle,

07:49.887 --> 07:51.805
and something that just happens?

07:51.847 --> 07:56.977
Like, um, rain.
Is rain a miracle?

07:57.978 --> 08:05.500
Maybe everything is a miracle.
Rain, comets... You... Me.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.572
It just depends on
how you look at it.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.908
People are calling this
the Christmas comet,

08:10.949 --> 08:12.159
but that's not the real name.

08:12.201 --> 08:15.913
-Oh, yeah?
-It's the De Vico comet.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.900
That's the person who discovered it.
I read it in a book.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.251
-And you know what?
-What?

08:21.251 --> 08:24.046
It won't come again until 71 years.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.548
-And you know what else?
-What?

08:26.590 --> 08:31.678
-I know a secret.
-Will you tell me?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.799
I think comets are miracles.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.808
Yoo-hoo!

08:39.061 --> 08:41.063
We're all waiting for you.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.940
Do you mind if I borrow her
for a while, Toby?

08:42.981 --> 08:44.066
Okay.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.988
Don't forget about the comet tonight.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.163
Nurse Hanna!
You forgot your camera!

09:07.798 --> 09:09.258
Do you hear that?
Was I right?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.343
Doctor Axelrod has
such a beautiful voice.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.887
He's like an opera singer,
just listen.

09:14.972 --> 09:17.057
That's Mary Grace.
She can never remember the lyrics.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.976
She's a riot.
Come on.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.895
¶ ...of comfort and joy

09:21.937 --> 09:23.355
¶ Comfort and joy...

09:23.397 --> 09:27.276
I just want to make a phone call
first. Now? It's for Toby.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.944
I want to make sure
someone from the orphanage

09:28.986 --> 09:29.820
takes him home for Christmas.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.114
Aw...
Poor little boy.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.991
I'll be there in a minute, promise.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.159
Don't forget, we're all going
to the gazebo.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.954
¶ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly..

09:38.996 --> 09:40.080
That's my favorite!
Hurry!

09:40.122 --> 09:42.124
¶ Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la...

09:42.165 --> 09:44.626
¶ 'tis the season to be jolly

09:44.668 --> 09:46.628
¶ Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la...

09:46.670 --> 09:49.673
I'm sorry, the line is out of order.
Thanks.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.344
¶ ...Joy to the world

09:54.386 --> 09:56.346
¶ The Lord is come

09:56.388 --> 10:01.018
¶ Let Earth receive her king

10:01.018 --> 10:05.355
¶ Let every heart prepare him room

10:05.397 --> 10:09.818
¶ And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing

10:09.860 --> 10:14.406
¶ And Heaven
And Heaven and nature sing...

11:33.026 --> 11:37.281
Oh...
Oh, poor baby, are you cold?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.118
-Hi!
-Hi...

11:41.159 --> 11:43.120
Aw, poor thing.

11:44.329 --> 11:49.960
Let's see.
"Ruffin..." Is that your name?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.129
Aw, are you lost?

11:53.130 --> 11:55.132
You're a ways from home, aren't you?

11:58.552 --> 12:02.472
...and her tone of voice--
Let me tell you, Miss Know-it-All.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.433
It's just a phase.
Tina did the same thing--

12:04.474 --> 12:07.019
Excuse me. Hello?
I'd like to make a call.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.147
...well, just last week..
Ruffin! ...she had the gall to say..

12:10.189 --> 12:13.859
-Excuse me, can I make a call, please?
-Is this an emergency?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.444
Um, well, no, but..

12:15.485 --> 12:18.155
Well, if it's not an emergency, you're
going to have to wait your turn.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.325
We'll be off in a jiff.
Right.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.330
Aw...

12:26.330 --> 12:30.292
I know. I tried.
I tried...

12:30.334 --> 12:34.963
Look at that snow coming down.
Your owner must be worried sick.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.466
Okay. Come on, you wanna go home?
Let's go home.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.255
Ruffin?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.299
Oh, my gosh!
Hal, it's Ruffin!

13:23.136 --> 13:26.014
Oh, my goodness, where were you?
Thank you so much.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.308
Come here, Ruffin! Come here...

13:28.350 --> 13:31.228
Oh, please, won't you come in?
Oh, thank you.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.300
Oh, Ruffin...

13:35.023 --> 13:38.402
Where were you?
You bad boy.

13:38.402 --> 13:40.404
Aw...
She lives for that dog.

13:40.404 --> 13:44.867
Honestly, I never knew how much
until just now. Right, boy?

13:44.908 --> 13:47.452
Gosh, I just, I don't know
what we would have done

13:47.494 --> 13:49.204
if you hadn't brought him home.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.000
You're our hero.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.210
Oh, heroes change the world,
I just did a simple thing.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.213
Well, you saved our Christmas,
I can tell you that.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.966
Can you imagine
how heartbroken we would all be?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.301
Christmas without Ruffin?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.429
Oh, that's little Clara.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.973
I didn't even have the heart to
tell her that Ruffin was missing.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.268
I'll go.
Stay the night, won't you?

14:11.310 --> 14:14.271
-Oh, no, I..
-But the snow is really coming down.

14:14.271 --> 14:17.399
Thank you, but I don't live far,
just over on Elm Street.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.569
But I should be going.

14:20.611 --> 14:22.321
You sure that there's no way
that we can thank you?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.323
You already have.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.617
-Merry Christmas.
-And to you.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.119
-Drive safe.
-Will do.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.456
Come here, Ruffin, come here.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.916
Come here. come here...

14:50.474 --> 14:52.433
Oh, darn.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.474
What?

17:47.776 --> 17:50.279
Hey, wait for me!

17:56.159 --> 17:58.412
Miss, are you okay?

17:58.453 --> 18:01.623
Uh... I... I don't...

18:01.665 --> 18:05.210
The cars, they're...
I... the cars?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.379
I don't... this isn't right.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.798
-Is she okay?
-I don't know.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.426
Miss? Are you lost?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.929
No, I don't...
I don't...

18:16.722 --> 18:20.642
What is happening?
I just, I have to get home.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.519
Hello?

18:22.519 --> 18:25.397
Yeah, there is a woman here
who seems lost.

18:25.439 --> 18:27.191
Center and main?

18:27.232 --> 18:29.359
I don't know what's happening...
She's heading north on center.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.278
Thank you.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.864
Oh, definitely football.
Over baseball?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.699
-Mm-hmm.
-You do not.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.160
What, you think you know
everything about me?

18:38.202 --> 18:40.537
Yeah, I kinda do.
I've known you my whole life.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.789
Okay, you do not know
everything about me.

18:42.831 --> 18:45.751
Oh...
"Man of mystery".

18:45.792 --> 18:48.420
Not!
So you think.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.380
And anything I want to know
Louise tells me.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.592
Oh, please, shoot me now.
Why, hmm?

18:53.634 --> 18:56.595
Why am I partners with my little
sister's best friend?

18:56.637 --> 18:59.556
'cause... you trust me.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.767
Okay, ma'am, hands on your side
of the vehicle..

19:01.808 --> 19:03.727
And I... Make you look good.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.232
Can you please be a little less
bratty when you're in uniform?

19:09.358 --> 19:13.695
-Dispatch to 403...
-Yeah, 403.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.781
We have a report of a female
on main street

19:15.822 --> 19:18.492
at center road who may need
a well-being check.

19:18.534 --> 19:21.203
-Can you investigate that?
-Copy that. En route.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.503
I...

19:32.506 --> 19:34.423
Ruffin?

19:40.430 --> 19:42.200
Excuse me...

19:42.432 --> 19:47.271
Oh...
I'm sorry, forgive me.

19:53.485 --> 19:56.362
Excuse me, miss, but are you, uh...

19:58.615 --> 20:00.200
Is everything okay?

20:03.412 --> 20:06.000
Can you help me?

20:11.295 --> 20:13.964
How long do you think
you were unconscious?

20:13.964 --> 20:17.968
I don't know.
I... I just heard a big, um...

20:19.344 --> 20:22.890
...a big boom.
It was thunder, during the storm.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.726
Storm?
And that's all I remember.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.729
Do you think I'm dreaming?

20:29.855 --> 20:32.649
You all seem so real, but...

20:32.649 --> 20:36.486
Everything, it doesn't...
It doesn't seem right.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.822
How long were you in the shed
before you came out?

20:38.864 --> 20:40.324
Just the night.

20:40.324 --> 20:44.411
My car got stuck in the snow.
Her vital signs are normal.

20:44.453 --> 20:49.291
I was reading Ladies Home Journal,
and they had a story on dreams once

20:49.333 --> 20:50.250
about how they seem like they
could be real..

20:50.292 --> 20:53.837
Shh... Just follow
the light with your eyes.

20:53.879 --> 20:58.008
-Have you located the vehicle?
-No, chief.

20:58.050 --> 21:02.471
-Can you tell me the make and model?
-Of what?

21:02.513 --> 21:05.057
Your car.
What kind of car do you have?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.852
-A Hudson.
-A what?

21:08.894 --> 21:11.939
My husband bought it
right before the war.

21:11.980 --> 21:14.066
I'm not seeing any signs
of a concussion.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.402
Her vision is fine.
No headaches? Mm-mm.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.364
And has he been contacted?
Your husband?

21:20.405 --> 21:23.575
No. He died, in the war.

21:24.785 --> 21:28.705
-I'm sorry to hear that. Iraq?
-What?

21:28.705 --> 21:31.375
Or maybe he was deployed
in Afghanistan?

21:32.668 --> 21:36.338
France. He was in Malmedy.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.008
Mrs. Morse,
could you tell us the date?

21:41.134 --> 21:45.013
Um, it's December.. 16th.

21:45.055 --> 21:47.891
No, 17th.
And where are we? What city?

21:49.059 --> 21:51.500
Well, Central Falls, of course.

21:51.603 --> 21:54.731
-And the name of the president?
-Harry S. Truman.

22:02.072 --> 22:06.743
Amnesia? Can't be.
She knows her name, city, date.

22:06.785 --> 22:10.497
Yeah, but there was no storm
last night.

22:10.539 --> 22:13.834
-Maybe she's pulling a scam?
-Possible.

22:13.876 --> 22:16.086
Her address doesn't check out,
her car doesn't check out.

22:16.128 --> 22:19.464
Whatever a "Hudson" is,
and she has no I.D.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.718
She says she left it back in the shed.
That's a likely story.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.928
We're going to have to take her in.
On what charge?

22:24.928 --> 22:26.763
For now, we'll just get
some more information from her.

22:26.763 --> 22:31.894
It's either that, or a 1701.
What, involuntary commitment?

22:31.935 --> 22:33.896
Hey, wait, wait, hold on,
chief, chief.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.480
This all just seems
a little bit harsh.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.899
It's just procedure, Jake, that's all.

22:38.150 --> 22:42.529
Let me take her back to the farm.
Okay? Just for a day or two.

22:42.571 --> 22:45.866
Just let her calm down, feel safe.
I don't know.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.452
It's against protocol,
and I'm not sure she'll even--

22:48.493 --> 22:49.411
We haven't processed her yet.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.956
Just...
Let me observe her, okay?

22:52.956 --> 22:55.125
If she's delusional,
I'll take her to the hospital.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.127
If I sense she's a fraud,
I'll bring her back to the station.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.589
If she's a con artist, she's going
to play you at every turn.

23:00.631 --> 23:05.719
Come on, it's almost Christmas,
and I will take full responsibility.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.012
Okay?

23:20.776 --> 23:23.987
I know this place.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.789
So, my parents live here
in the big house.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.499
I live in one of the outbuildings,

23:35.499 --> 23:39.628
and my sister moved back
with her daughter, temporarily.

23:39.670 --> 23:41.588
We buy our milk here.

23:41.630 --> 23:46.009
The Morgans have the best cows,
don't you think?

23:46.009 --> 23:49.096
Actually, um, this used to be
the Smith farm.

23:49.137 --> 23:51.014
My grandparents bought it from them

23:51.056 --> 23:53.766
back in the '60s,
and they renovated it.

23:54.768 --> 23:57.062
What do you mean, "back in the '60s"?

23:59.648 --> 24:01.024
What do you mean what do I mean?

24:04.194 --> 24:06.864
What year is it... now?

24:08.073 --> 24:10.199
It's 2016.

24:16.081 --> 24:19.042
The way you're looking at me,
you don't believe me, do you?

24:19.042 --> 24:21.211
I, um...

24:23.130 --> 24:25.500
Why don't we go inside?
Come on.

24:29.887 --> 24:33.015
Well, the text was 20 minutes ago,
so they should be here any minute.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.850
Is he really going to let her
stay here?

24:34.892 --> 24:36.809
She could be..

24:38.896 --> 24:40.500
Oh, they're here!

24:40.939 --> 24:44.000
So, everybody, say hello to Hanna.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.740
Welcome, dear.

24:58.248 --> 25:01.835
You did absolutely the right thing
to call the police.

25:01.877 --> 25:04.087
Okay, how about here?
More towards you.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.049
Okay.
I'm just saying it's shifty.

25:10.260 --> 25:14.806
Here? A little right.
You know, it's just shifty.

25:14.848 --> 25:16.767
I mean, some stranger in a costume

25:16.808 --> 25:19.770
shows up in the middle
of Central Falls,

25:19.811 --> 25:21.938
pretending she doesn't know
where she is?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
She didn't seem shifty.
She seemed nice.

25:24.274 --> 25:27.110
-How about now?
-Back it up.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.989
You know, people who take advantage
of others always seem nice.

25:31.031 --> 25:34.826
Do you know how many identity thefts
there were last year? 15 million.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.786
Google it.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.664
How about now?

25:39.998 --> 25:44.294
Actually, I think it's better
by the window. Okay.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.297
You remember the fellow who sold me
the time shares in Florida?

25:47.297 --> 25:49.258
Here we go with the time shares.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.760
Mom, this lady
wasn't selling time shares.

25:51.802 --> 25:53.262
He was the nicest guy
you'd ever to meet.

25:53.303 --> 25:54.137
So handsome...

25:55.806 --> 25:57.975
Never in a million years
would you believe that he was just...

25:57.975 --> 25:59.935
"...up to no good."

25:59.977 --> 26:01.854
Never in a million years.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.231
Sweetheart, when did you become
so suspicious?

26:04.273 --> 26:07.609
I'm not suspicious.
It's women's intuition.

26:07.651 --> 26:11.822
And I just feel that something fishy
in going on around here.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.242
Okay.

26:27.337 --> 26:30.132
I think you could be
a little more charitable.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.259
Mom, I'm not being uncharitable.

26:32.301 --> 26:34.636
It's just, I don't know...

26:34.678 --> 26:36.054
It's a little weird,
you have to admit.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.681
Where did she come from?

26:37.681 --> 26:40.309
We don't know, and now
she's just here in our house?

26:40.350 --> 26:42.394
Mom, if she has amnesia,

26:42.436 --> 26:43.770
will she forget
she met us last night?

26:43.812 --> 26:46.398
Gwenny, not so much sugar
on your oatmeal.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.401
You know, she seems fine to me.

26:49.443 --> 26:51.361
I mean, the clothes
are a little weird, but..

26:51.403 --> 26:55.157
Dad, no one just lands in
Central Falls without knowing how.

26:55.199 --> 26:56.658
She is perfectly nice.

26:56.700 --> 27:00.162
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for what happened.

27:00.204 --> 27:02.623
Besides, she didn't land here, mom.
She's from here.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.210
Okay, so has anyone
ever seen her before?

27:06.210 --> 27:07.294
Or heard of her?

27:07.336 --> 27:09.338
Shh, shh, shh!
Guys, guys...

27:09.379 --> 27:11.381
What if she walks in here,
and she hears all of this?

27:11.423 --> 27:14.134
Just let her rest, get her bearings,

27:14.176 --> 27:16.345
and we'll all get to know her
in no time.

27:16.386 --> 27:19.431
Shouldn't you have just a little bit
more professional skepticism?

27:19.473 --> 27:23.018
There's nothing wrong with having
a trusting spirit.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.311
Why don't I go in and check on her,

27:24.353 --> 27:28.273
see if she's awake,
and you all be nice?

27:28.315 --> 27:32.778
Remember, she's a guest in this house.
Hey, mom.

27:32.819 --> 27:36.406
Hey, um, were there ever any
Christmas lights on the old gazebo?

27:36.406 --> 27:39.409
On the square?
Christmas lights on the gazebo?

27:39.409 --> 27:42.412
Um, no. Why do you ask?
Oh, uh, nothing.

27:42.454 --> 27:45.249
Just something Hanna said.
Hmm.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.134
Hanna?
You awake?

27:57.135 --> 27:59.428
Hanna?

28:02.975 --> 28:05.978
Jake? Jake!
She's gone!

28:10.399 --> 28:12.700
What...
What are you...?

28:12.943 --> 28:14.500
"Organic planet"?

28:30.043 --> 28:32.461
Can I help you find something?

28:34.131 --> 28:37.259
Gluten-free toothpaste?
This is my dining room.

28:37.301 --> 28:39.428
Where are all my things?

28:39.469 --> 28:41.930
Uh...
What was that?

28:41.972 --> 28:43.432
I...

28:43.473 --> 28:47.144
It's my kitchen.
This is my home, I live here.

28:48.312 --> 28:50.271
Right.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.152
I've... got to make a call.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.372
She left.
I tried to keep her here, but..

29:07.414 --> 29:10.209
Which way?
Thank you.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.878
Well...
Is she, like, dangerous or anything?

29:20.552 --> 29:23.513
What...
What happened to the hospital?

29:24.139 --> 29:27.476
-There is no hospital..
-No, it's a hospital!

29:27.518 --> 29:30.895
This is supposed to be the hospital!

29:36.902 --> 29:38.487
Hanna?

29:42.282 --> 29:44.534
Come on.

29:48.372 --> 29:53.043
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I was leaving. I couldn't sleep.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.463
All night, I kept thinking,
if I could just get home,

29:56.505 --> 29:59.967
that somehow home would make
everything normal again.

30:00.008 --> 30:03.887
But... But now I don't know
what my home is.

30:03.929 --> 30:06.431
I don't even what "Gluten free" is.

30:06.473 --> 30:10.978
Most of us don't.
And then I thought of Dottie.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.105
-If I could get to the hospital..
-What hospital?

30:13.146 --> 30:16.275
And today's her shift, and Dottie
would explain everything to me,

30:16.316 --> 30:19.570
and somehow it would make sense,
but...

30:19.611 --> 30:22.990
But Dottie was gone.
Well, everything's gone.

30:23.031 --> 30:26.201
I... I don't know
what's happening to me.

30:26.243 --> 30:28.300
None of this is real.

30:29.079 --> 30:34.459
I don't know if I'm dreaming,
or if I'm losing my mind, or what.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.505
It must be really hard for you.

30:38.547 --> 30:43.927
And I see the way people
are looking at me, like I'm crazy.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.928
Or worse, lying.

30:47.222 --> 30:51.560
You were right, about our farm
being the Morgan place.

30:51.602 --> 30:55.189
It was a dairy, back in the '40s.

30:55.230 --> 31:00.360
-Do you believe me then?
-Well, I believe, um...

31:00.402 --> 31:02.237
I believe that we're going
to find out what happened.

31:07.951 --> 31:09.619
I'm really scared.

31:11.330 --> 31:13.247
You're going to be okay.

31:14.082 --> 31:16.500
I'm here to make sure of that, okay?

31:22.424 --> 31:24.635
Right.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.110
Hey.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.657
-The chief's not happy.
-I know.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.244
You gotta bring her in, Jake.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.412
You're gonna get in trouble
if she disappears for real.

31:52.454 --> 31:55.374
She's not going to. She was just
trying to figure out what happened.

31:55.415 --> 31:59.336
Oh, yeah? So, what's her angle?
There is no angle.

31:59.378 --> 32:02.673
I believe her.
Oh...

32:02.673 --> 32:06.510
Oh, so she just dropped
out of the sky from 1945?

32:06.510 --> 32:08.929
I mean, I believe she believes it.

32:10.472 --> 32:12.140
You'd better find something,

32:12.182 --> 32:13.559
or you're going to start
sounding as wacky as she does.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.271
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

32:17.312 --> 32:19.398
-It's what I'm here for.
-Yeah.

32:20.482 --> 32:23.110
-Right, I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.620
Let's see how this works...

32:33.662 --> 32:36.415
Oh, yes, it fits perfectly,
doesn't it, Louise?

32:36.456 --> 32:38.458
Yeah...
Great.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.336
Okay, so try these, and...

32:41.378 --> 32:46.341
-I got the uggs on Ebay.
-"Ugg sunnybay?"

32:46.383 --> 32:50.721
Mom, she doesn't understand.
They didn't have uggs in 1945.

32:50.762 --> 32:53.307
Ladies always wore heels.

32:53.348 --> 32:58.103
It says so right here.
O... kay. Great.

32:58.145 --> 32:59.271
Well then, you are going
to love these.

33:00.731 --> 33:06.153
Bedroom slippers?
Why don't you try these?

33:07.279 --> 33:09.989
You can go try them on in there.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.534
Anything else...

33:26.632 --> 33:29.134
Wonderful.
Wow!

33:30.427 --> 33:32.095
Look at her, uncle Jake.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.365
And it's like a...

33:51.406 --> 33:55.118
You know, a tag sale,
but for the whole world.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.287
Like, imagine you move,

33:57.329 --> 33:59.164
and you don't want to take
your stuff with you,

33:59.206 --> 34:01.124
you can sell it here.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.626
And you can find anything.

34:02.626 --> 34:05.796
Like, charm bracelets,
or once I found a spoon

34:05.796 --> 34:07.756
from the year my mom was born.

34:09.299 --> 34:14.638
-And... it's inside this little thing?
-No, this is just a computer.

34:18.308 --> 34:21.520
A computer is like a...
A car.

34:21.562 --> 34:24.481
It can take you anywhere, but you
don't have to leave where you are.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.654
Think of it like...

34:31.737 --> 34:35.449
Never mind. Let's just look
for something. Like...

34:35.492 --> 34:37.702
What year were you born?

34:38.286 --> 34:40.204
1912.

34:47.254 --> 34:52.342
Oh, my goodness. My mother had a set
of dishes just like that.

34:52.384 --> 34:55.762
Oh, wait, make it go down again.

34:55.804 --> 35:00.225
Look at that hat.
I bought one just like that.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.000
They're selling it for that much?

35:10.194 --> 35:14.531
Apparently, she made a scene
in the health food store.

35:14.531 --> 35:17.326
Well, if I had to eat quinoa
I'd make a scene, too.

35:17.367 --> 35:21.371
Harv, I'm serious.
She said it was her house.

35:21.371 --> 35:24.708
As in, she lived there.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.419
Sorry, she thinks she lives
in the health food store?

35:27.461 --> 35:30.881
Mm-hmm. Well, then she escaped
before the police got there.

35:30.923 --> 35:34.343
Oh, and I had George google her,
and you know what he found?

35:34.384 --> 35:36.887
-What?
-Nothing.

35:36.887 --> 35:39.723
Oh, well, I mean,
I've googled myself before,

35:39.765 --> 35:42.601
and nothing turned up,
and I'm not saying I'm from 1945..

35:42.643 --> 35:43.894
-From 1945.
-Yeah.

35:43.894 --> 35:46.480
She's pretending that
she doesn't know how she got here.

35:46.522 --> 35:49.608
I mean, what did she do,
time travel to now?

35:49.650 --> 35:52.903
That'd be cool.
Great.

35:52.903 --> 35:55.906
Hon', look, I'm not
saying that none of this

35:55.906 --> 35:57.908
is out of the ordinary,
but don't you think..

35:57.908 --> 36:00.869
I am not being paranoid.
1940s, my foot.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.413
I am getting to the bottom
of this, I am.

36:03.413 --> 36:05.666
-Yeah, I know you will.
-I will.

36:05.707 --> 36:07.459
You and I are going to do
a little more research.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.500
Okay...

37:16.820 --> 37:18.947
Nothin'.

37:18.989 --> 37:23.243
DMV records don't
go back that far. Hmm.

37:24.328 --> 37:29.875
-No photo. Convenient.
-Well, they didn't have them then.

37:29.917 --> 37:32.836
In fact, until the '30s,
they didn't have drivers' licenses.

37:32.836 --> 37:35.500
Aren't you becoming the historian.

37:35.839 --> 37:39.718
She could have gotten this printed
at any copy place. And her get-up?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.512
You can find those clothes
at the thrift store.

37:41.512 --> 37:44.723
-And why would she want to do that?
-I don't know, identity theft?

37:44.765 --> 37:48.852
Oh, come on. Louise says
she is making herself quite at home.

37:48.852 --> 37:51.980
Maybe she's homeless,
and she wants you to take her in.

37:52.022 --> 37:57.694
Sarah... Well, you tell me.
She didn't just drop in from 1945.

37:59.363 --> 38:03.492
"Lune Paris."
"Paris Moon."

38:05.702 --> 38:08.496
Stop playing with the evidence.

38:09.790 --> 38:11.800
Just sayin'.

38:23.804 --> 38:27.891
That's it...
Just like that.

38:27.933 --> 38:30.602
-And this makes it stick?
-Mm-hmm.

38:30.644 --> 38:35.399
Are you sure? What if it falls?
It won't. How do you know?

38:36.692 --> 38:40.404
Oh, Dottie and I,
used to make one every Christmas.

38:40.445 --> 38:45.951
But when the war started, sugar
was rationed. What is "rationed"?

38:45.993 --> 38:48.537
Gwenny... I think it's time
to get ready for bed.

38:48.579 --> 38:53.000
But.. "But" nothing. Go on.
Will Hanna read to me?

38:53.041 --> 38:56.960
I guess you're going
to have to ask Hanna. Of course.

38:57.100 --> 39:00.000
I would love to.
Yes!

39:02.092 --> 39:06.930
You sure? You don't have to.
Oh, no, I want to.

39:06.930 --> 39:11.000
I... I just... Well, I've always
wondered what Christmas would be like

39:11.200 --> 39:13.150
with a big family.

39:13.478 --> 39:18.817
Well, it's a little bit chaotic.
No, it's... It's perfect.

39:26.033 --> 39:29.912
"'It's a miracle,' the wise old woman
told Lily, but Lily frowned

39:29.953 --> 39:32.539
"because she didn't believe
in miracles.

39:32.581 --> 39:34.875
"Outside, the snow fell silently,

39:34.917 --> 39:38.504
"and the only noise
was the stomping of small hooves.

39:38.545 --> 39:40.900
The reindeer were impatient."

39:43.133 --> 39:46.386
It's probably time for bed.

39:47.137 --> 39:51.200
Hanna...
Do you believe in miracles?

39:52.476 --> 39:58.649
Well... I don't know. I mean...
I don't know what I think anymore.

39:58.690 --> 40:03.862
I do. Mr. Cook says you should believe
in everything with an open mind.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.616
Your Mr. Cook
must be a very smart man.

40:07.658 --> 40:12.037
He runs the science fair. He also
turned an old building into the library.

40:12.079 --> 40:16.500
He paid for it himself.
He's exceedingly wealthy.

40:17.501 --> 40:22.130
Well, that old building was my hospital,
and it was just built before the war.

40:22.172 --> 40:29.600
-He also believes in time travel.
-He does?

40:29.804 --> 40:33.015
Mr. Cook says just because
you don't understand something

40:33.015 --> 40:35.809
doesn't mean it doesn't happen.

40:37.688 --> 40:40.190
Gwenny?
It's time for bed.

40:45.612 --> 40:47.905
Let's go.

41:14.099 --> 41:18.645
All right, all you stargazers out there,
get out your wool hats and your scarves.

41:18.687 --> 41:24.067
Tonight will be the first appearance
of the De Vico comet in 71 years.

41:24.109 --> 41:26.800
Just in time for Christmas.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.800
This has been Fred Damsky
with Public Radio.

41:38.790 --> 41:42.836
We'll just get that one present
for your father, and then we'll...

41:42.878 --> 41:46.131
George?
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

41:46.173 --> 41:50.718
Hang on, I just got a text. It's like
that thing's attached to your arm.

42:05.901 --> 42:09.279
Nope.
Can't say I've ever seen her before.

42:09.279 --> 42:12.782
She would have come in to buy
a whole outfit of 1940s clothes.

42:12.782 --> 42:16.827
Oh, I would remember her. I've got
loads of great stuff from the '40s.

42:16.869 --> 42:19.900
Nobody's interested now.
It's all about the '80s.

42:20.082 --> 42:23.126
I told you, Louise.
You're not being kind.

42:23.126 --> 42:26.255
I'm just being careful, mother.
You're being suspicious.

42:26.296 --> 42:29.967
We should be supportive.
It's Christmas, after all. Mom!

42:30.008 --> 42:32.802
Look!

42:36.390 --> 42:41.687
Beautiful. Harv... You are not
going to believe what I am seeing.

42:41.728 --> 42:45.816
Now, you thought I was paranoid,
but I think I know what's going on.

42:45.816 --> 42:48.484
This is one of my favorite
things about the period.

42:51.321 --> 42:54.783
Mom...
You have to come and see this.

42:55.784 --> 42:59.371
It's the gazebo.
It is just like Hanna said it was.

42:59.413 --> 43:04.710
Look at how beautiful it is.
Look at all the lights. What happened?

43:04.751 --> 43:08.338
People used to pass these traditions
on to their children.

43:08.338 --> 43:11.400
I don't know, kids these days
just don't seem interested

43:11.600 --> 43:13.100
the way they used to.

43:13.343 --> 43:17.848
Yes, that's exactly how it is.
I mean... was.

43:17.890 --> 43:20.976
Everybody comes out for it,
seems like all the neighbors.

43:21.018 --> 43:27.024
We'd carol, we'd drink hot chocolate,
we'd laugh. Can I carol?

43:27.065 --> 43:32.362
Kids don't go caroling anymore?
I guess we just... don't.

43:32.404 --> 43:36.241
I don't know, we've just never
done it. Can we, mommy? Can we carol?

43:36.283 --> 43:38.202
Yes.

43:38.202 --> 43:41.200
In fact,
I have an even better idea.

43:43.332 --> 43:46.668
...and that got me to thinking,
what if they're all in it together?

43:46.710 --> 43:49.838
A conspiracy? Well, you don't think
it's a coincidence?

43:49.880 --> 43:51.800
I mean, some stranger just drops
into town

43:52.000 --> 43:54.500
in a costume, and instead
of arresting her,

43:54.700 --> 43:57.000
or taking her in for questioning
or whatever,

43:57.200 --> 44:01.350
the entire policeman's family are in
there buying the same kind of clothes.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.727
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:03.727 --> 44:06.939
-Why would they want to do that?
-My point exactly.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.900
The whole thing is just
getting weirder and weirder.

44:21.411 --> 44:27.417
Hey! I didn't think anyone was home.
Just me. Are you okay?

44:29.461 --> 44:35.342
It's all a little strange.
A lot strange.

44:35.384 --> 44:38.971
And sometimes, I look around
at all of this,

44:39.012 --> 44:43.724
and at the tree,
and your great family, and...

44:44.434 --> 44:47.813
I feel happy.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

44:47.855 --> 44:51.775
But then I feel guilty
for being happy.

44:51.775 --> 44:56.822
It's just... I mean, I...
I'm not explaining this well.

44:56.864 --> 45:02.119
That's okay. I just... Well, I've
never known a Christmas like this.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.788
It wasn't like this back when...

45:05.830 --> 45:09.501
Well, where... You know,
where I was, and- and...

45:09.543 --> 45:12.296
The war, it changed everything.

45:12.337 --> 45:15.800
But even before that,
I never had a big family.

45:16.800 --> 45:21.013
I had my husband, Chet.
We were friends since childhood.

45:21.054 --> 45:24.307
We always knew
we would be married, and...

45:24.348 --> 45:28.020
And, finally, we were, right before
the war. And then he was gone.

45:29.980 --> 45:32.315
And now...

45:32.941 --> 45:36.800
-Everything is gone.
-Not everything.

45:38.405 --> 45:42.000
You have all of us,
and this Christmas.

45:46.455 --> 45:51.251
Here.
This... Is one of my favorites.

45:52.920 --> 45:56.340
What is it?
What, this?

45:56.340 --> 46:01.428
Um... It's a, uh...
They used to be called "albums".

46:09.520 --> 46:11.800
Can you dance?

46:17.528 --> 46:20.000
Brings back memories.

46:23.116 --> 46:25.800
It's so strange.

46:26.000 --> 46:29.206
I don't know if I'll ever be able
to get used to any of this.

46:29.248 --> 46:33.000
I'll help you.
You can trust me.

46:50.310 --> 46:52.020
Hey, guys.

47:00.404 --> 47:04.908
Mom, it was innocent. I was just
trying to make Hanna feel okay.

47:04.950 --> 47:08.370
-Don't tell me. Tell Sarah.
-Tell Sarah what?

47:08.412 --> 47:12.916
Oh, Jakey, you can see
how she looks at you. Sarah?

47:12.958 --> 47:15.168
Oh, ma, don't be silly.

47:16.461 --> 47:21.842
What do you think?
Oh! That is gonna be perfect.

47:22.634 --> 47:24.261
Okay, what are you girls up to?

47:24.303 --> 47:27.306
It was Louise's idea.
It was Hanna's inspiration.

47:27.347 --> 47:30.434
We're all gonna go out caroling tomorrow,
like an old-fashioned Christmas.

47:30.434 --> 47:36.190
In this? You said you wanted to make
her feel more comfortable, didn't you?

47:36.231 --> 47:41.278
And invite Sarah. Tell her that
you're sorry. Sorry for what?

47:42.404 --> 47:46.000
You're such a dope. What?
You saw her face!

47:46.408 --> 47:48.118
Okay, what is this, hmm?

47:48.160 --> 47:52.956
Is this some sort of, like, secret
female language I'm missing? Ow.

48:05.636 --> 48:08.804
I love snow.

48:09.473 --> 48:13.226
-Do you like snow?
-White Christmas, and all that?

48:14.102 --> 48:16.800
That'd be nice.

48:21.235 --> 48:26.031
What about you? Hmm?
Do you want snow?

48:27.449 --> 48:33.455
People are talking. What?
You know what.

48:34.748 --> 48:37.501
Um, if I knew what,
I wouldn't be asking what.

48:37.501 --> 48:40.045
-So...
-What?

48:41.213 --> 48:43.506
Her?

48:43.757 --> 48:48.095
Sighing isn't denying.
What am I even denying?

48:48.136 --> 48:51.014
People are worried
about who this stranger is,

48:51.056 --> 48:53.432
and we're supposed to be
"investigating,"

48:53.474 --> 48:56.477
but in reality,
one of us has the hots for her.

48:56.519 --> 48:58.100
Oh, I do not.

48:58.313 --> 49:01.191
You think I'm just your little
sister's Goofy friend, but, uh,

49:01.191 --> 49:04.527
I wasn't born yesterday.

49:04.569 --> 49:08.322
Oh, Sarah, come on.
I saw it with my own eyes.

49:08.657 --> 49:10.325
Look, what am I supposed
to tell people who are worried?

49:10.367 --> 49:13.453
Like what, slow dancing is some
new interrogation technique?

49:13.495 --> 49:15.329
I wasn't dancing.

49:18.208 --> 49:21.128
We were dancing.
I.. We.. I..

49:21.170 --> 49:25.591
I was just trying to make her feel
comfortable, that's all. Obviously.

49:25.632 --> 49:29.386
I mean, you should get a promotion for
"making the suspect feel comfortable".

49:29.428 --> 49:34.057
Okay, stop doing that. What?
This.. The air-quote.

49:34.057 --> 49:38.228
Is she guilty? No!
A fraud? No. Unhinged? No.

49:39.229 --> 49:43.691
-Then what?
-I don't know.

49:45.152 --> 49:48.154
Maybe you should
dance with her some more.

49:48.238 --> 49:52.701
You are such a brat, you know that?
So are you going to come tonight?

49:52.743 --> 49:55.162
What, caroling?
Mm-hmm.

49:55.204 --> 49:59.541
Are we gathering more information
on the suspect? Come on... Just come.

49:59.583 --> 50:03.544
My mom wants you to be there.
Do it for her.

50:04.546 --> 50:07.090
Give me the rest of your fries,
and I'll consider it.

50:07.090 --> 50:11.011
-Phew, that's a tough one.
-Okay.

50:19.603 --> 50:25.317
¶ God rest ye merry gentlemen
¶ Let nothing you dismay

50:25.359 --> 50:30.781
¶ Remember Christ, our saviour
¶ Was born on Christmas day...

50:30.822 --> 50:33.450
¶ To save us all from Satan's power

50:33.450 --> 50:38.080
¶ When we were gone astray
¶ O, tidings...

50:39.122 --> 50:42.084
¶ ...of comfort and joy
¶ Comfort and joy

50:42.125 --> 50:46.421
¶ O, tidings
Of comfort and joy...

50:46.463 --> 50:49.341
¶ ...laughing all the way

50:49.383 --> 50:54.471
¶ Bells on bobbed tails ring
¶ Making spirits bright

50:54.471 --> 50:57.140
¶ What fun it is
To ride and sing

50:57.182 --> 50:59.476
¶ A sleighing song tonight

50:59.476 --> 51:04.314
¶ Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
¶ Jingle all the way!

51:04.314 --> 51:07.109
¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride

51:07.150 --> 51:10.153
¶ In a one-horse
open sleigh... Hey!

51:10.153 --> 51:15.117
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells
¶ Jingle all the way

51:15.158 --> 51:17.661
¶ Oh, what fun it is to ride

51:17.661 --> 51:20.581
¶ In a one-horse
open sleigh... Hey!

51:20.622 --> 51:25.627
¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells
¶ Jingle all the way

51:25.669 --> 51:28.463
¶ Oh, what fun, it is to ride...

51:28.505 --> 51:31.383
Hey.
What's going on?

51:31.425 --> 51:36.221
I was here. The night of the storm.
I brought the dog back.

51:36.263 --> 51:38.800
His name was Ruffin.

51:40.475 --> 51:44.646
It's different.
There wasn't a fence.

51:44.688 --> 51:49.401
But it is the same house.
Wait, you... You brought a dog here?

51:50.527 --> 51:53.655
He was lost.
He came to my house.

51:53.697 --> 51:57.492
I tried to call the owners, but
there were people on the party line,

51:57.534 --> 52:00.000
and they wouldn't get off.

52:00.200 --> 52:04.541
Party line? So I brought him here.
They were so kind.

52:04.583 --> 52:08.544
They invited me to stay
because the storm was so bad.

52:09.546 --> 52:12.299
And if I had stayed, I...

52:12.341 --> 52:16.553
I wouldn't have driven my car
into the snow bank, and...

52:16.595 --> 52:19.388
I'd still be back where I belong.

52:20.390 --> 52:23.500
Hey, we're going to go
to the town square, come on.

52:23.769 --> 52:25.270
Come on.

52:25.312 --> 52:28.649
¶ Oh, come
Let us adore him

52:28.690 --> 52:32.736
¶ Oh, come, let us adore him

52:32.736 --> 52:37.824
¶ Oh, come
Let us adore him

52:37.866 --> 52:41.662
¶ Christ the Lord...

52:44.706 --> 52:48.293
This is so much fun!
I know!

52:48.335 --> 52:52.381
You made us all so happy tonight,
dear. Me? I didn't do anything.

52:52.422 --> 52:55.467
You inspired us.
All of us.

52:55.509 --> 52:58.303
It's such a shame that they don't
light up the gazebo anymore.

52:58.345 --> 53:02.474
Oh, it was so beautiful.
It would light up the whole square.

53:04.852 --> 53:07.770
Oh, that's our war memorial.

53:09.731 --> 53:14.861
It honors all of the town's men
who were lost in war. I know.

53:19.783 --> 53:24.413
-Hanna?
-What is it?

53:24.454 --> 53:27.800
It's Chet's name.

53:33.589 --> 53:36.300
He died in the war, but...

53:36.500 --> 53:39.800
His name isn't here.

54:36.068 --> 54:41.532
Where have you been? Huh?
I have been texting you all night!

54:41.532 --> 54:45.369
Where have you been? Oh, uh, I dunno,
I didn't have my phone on.

54:45.410 --> 54:50.082
You live with that phone on.
Where were you? Nowhere.

54:50.123 --> 54:54.461
Son...
Everyone is somewhere. Huh?

54:54.503 --> 54:58.549
What is that? What is that around
your neck? Hanna gave it to me.

54:58.549 --> 55:03.387
It's like, you know, from old times,
1940, or something? Hanna?

55:03.387 --> 55:06.974
Mom, it's no big deal. We were all
singing songs and.. Singing songs?

55:08.433 --> 55:11.728
Harv, say something.
It was fun, what's the big deal?

55:11.728 --> 55:16.608
What am I supposed to say?
I.. Songs. That's... Okay.

55:16.650 --> 55:20.737
When did he start to sing? Hmm?
Mom... Oh, no. Mm-mm. No.

55:21.905 --> 55:26.743
Hon'... I am just going to ask
a few questions, that is all.

55:26.743 --> 55:29.000
Better safe than sorry.

55:31.081 --> 55:36.670
Buddy... singing?
Come on. Nice try.

55:39.089 --> 55:43.594
All I'm saying is that.. Hold on,
hold on, please. It's suspicious.

55:43.635 --> 55:46.138
The crazy claims, the weird clothing,
the brainwashing.

55:46.180 --> 55:49.724
-There's no brainwashing.
-Really?

55:51.143 --> 55:54.646
Okay, look, I can explain if..
And now everyone is singing.

55:54.688 --> 55:57.566
You know, since she got here, this
entire town has been out of whack..

55:57.608 --> 55:59.860
Mrs. Jones, if you'll.. And it's your
job to get to the bottom of it,

55:59.902 --> 56:01.778
but for some reason, she's staying
at your house.. Mrs. Jones...

56:01.778 --> 56:03.800
Like she's some sort of guest.
I am worried..

56:05.866 --> 56:11.413
Mrs. Jones, I can assure you,
the Central Falls Police Department

56:11.455 --> 56:14.166
has this situation
completely under control.

56:14.208 --> 56:19.922
We take your concerns seriously.
Don't we? Absolutely.

56:19.963 --> 56:24.593
And we are looking at every angle
on this. But now it's late.

56:26.637 --> 56:29.765
When the department is ready to issue
a statement, you'll be the first to know.

56:31.016 --> 56:34.936
Why don't you go on home now,
Mrs. Jones? We're taking care of it.

56:40.484 --> 56:42.485
Wow.

56:47.658 --> 56:50.786
We've got to do something, Jake.

56:50.827 --> 56:55.165
It's our duty to the people
of this town. It's our job.

56:55.207 --> 56:58.043
Every day that goes by, there's
something else that's fishy.

56:58.085 --> 57:01.088
Just tonight, her husband
supposedly died in the war?

57:01.129 --> 57:04.758
What's so fishy about that? But his
name's not listed on the memorial?

57:04.800 --> 57:09.513
That's fishy. So you're saying she's
lying about the house and the dog?

57:09.513 --> 57:12.015
The kennel is named after
the dog she found.

57:12.015 --> 57:14.434
I mean, how could she have pulled
that off? She could have read the sign,

57:14.476 --> 57:17.800
and then made up some story
about some dog named Ruffin.

57:18.605 --> 57:21.024
Con artists think on their feet.

57:21.066 --> 57:23.026
And the clothes, she could have
found at some thrift store.

57:23.026 --> 57:26.864
And the license, she could have had
printed. How can you keep wondering?

57:27.865 --> 57:32.744
"Paris Moon."
It was invented in 1928.

57:32.786 --> 57:35.747
By the '40s, it was one of the most
popular perfumes in the country.

57:35.789 --> 57:38.709
Okay. Great. So?

57:38.750 --> 57:42.212
Okay, so they stopped making it
in the '60s. There is no trace of it.

57:42.212 --> 57:44.715
I mean, there's no place
she could have gotten this.

57:44.715 --> 57:47.009
She could have found an old bottle
on Ebay. I had the lab test it.

57:48.093 --> 57:53.848
It hasn't oxidized yet.
This is the real deal, Sarah.

57:57.686 --> 57:59.271
Hmm.

57:59.313 --> 58:02.481
Hey, by the way, impressive whistle.

58:03.108 --> 58:06.737
Who taught you how to do that?
You did.

58:07.988 --> 58:09.900
Third grade.

58:14.578 --> 58:16.800
Let's go inside.

58:47.611 --> 58:51.532
I don't know how I got here, and
I don't know how I'll ever get home.

58:52.783 --> 58:56.286
This whole thing is as surreal to me
as it must be for all of you,

58:56.400 --> 59:01.542
and yet, you've all been so kind
to me. So, so kind.

59:03.085 --> 59:09.967
Just last week, when I was back...
Back in... In real time.

59:10.008 --> 59:12.719
I told Dottie, right there
in front of the movie house,

59:12.761 --> 59:16.014
I told her, "nothing ever
gets solved by blubbering".

59:16.056 --> 59:19.225
It just doesn't do anyone
any good at all.

59:19.643 --> 59:24.314
And since I don't know whether
I'll ever be able to get home again,

59:24.356 --> 59:27.275
I'm going to make the best
of things here.

59:27.818 --> 59:33.824
I'm gonna find happiness... I'm gonna
find some way to be useful, and...

59:33.866 --> 59:37.243
Just stop wishing things
would be different.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.670
I may have found a solution
for the town's Christmas lights.

59:49.756 --> 59:54.678
It's not going to change the world,
but... It's something.

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.317
Okay, so what's our next move?

01:00:08.358 --> 01:00:11.527
Why don't you call the Jones woman,
invite her to come meet Hanna,

01:00:11.569 --> 01:00:15.365
let her see what Hanna's surprise is.
Maybe she'll stop being a pain?

01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:19.035
Might want to present it
with a little more tact.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:23.248
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:28.295
Harv?
I'm going to the library!

01:00:39.806 --> 01:00:44.393
...and one of the nurses' stations,
it was right there..

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:51.360
I think.
It all looks so different.

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:54.946
Well, the adult patients' ward
was upstairs,

01:00:54.987 --> 01:00:59.242
and my favorite one, the pediatrics,
it was over in that corner.

01:01:00.035 --> 01:01:04.080
There was a door here,
it went to the back stairwell.

01:01:05.374 --> 01:01:08.252
Or maybe it was over here...

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:12.800
There's a door here.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:18.000
That goes down to the storage room.

01:01:23.308 --> 01:01:26.812
-Come on, it's this way.
-Are you sure?

01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:29.800
I can't believe
we never knew about this.

01:01:58.343 --> 01:02:01.054
Oh, wow, look at all those.

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.391
Well, well, well...

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:09.000
I always wondered
what was in that locker.

01:02:10.022 --> 01:02:15.485
-It's nice to see you again.
-Do I know you?

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:20.324
It's Mr. Cook.
He's the man I told you about.

01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:23.300
He's the one who made
this into the library.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.413
Oh, then you must think
I'm trespassing, but I can explain..

01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm... I'd like to show you something.
It'll only take a moment.

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:43.514
Books, as you can see, are my passion.
That's why I saved the old hospital.

01:02:43.555 --> 01:02:46.517
They were going to tear that
thing down, can you believe that?

01:02:46.558 --> 01:02:48.519
Tear it down?

01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:56.235
Books saved me from a very lonely
youth, being a child of war and all.

01:02:56.276 --> 01:02:59.529
Sometimes, the smallest things
change a life.

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:02.800
For me, it was reading.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:13.043
Ah, you incorrigible dogs!
I love 'em to death.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:17.506
Now, somehow, my assistant manages
to never spill a drop.

01:03:17.548 --> 01:03:20.467
Would you like some tea?
Thank you.

01:03:20.509 --> 01:03:22.510
Thank you.

01:03:23.554 --> 01:03:25.180
I have to be truthful here,

01:03:25.222 --> 01:03:31.895
I have heard all the stories about
you, and... "time travel". Oh.

01:03:31.937 --> 01:03:35.147
Oh, so you just wanted to see
the talk of the town.

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:38.985
That's true, but...

01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:44.073
Actually, I wanted to see
how you were doing.

01:03:45.534 --> 01:03:50.372
Do you mean that...
Do you mean that... You believe me?

01:03:51.915 --> 01:03:54.835
More than that.

01:03:57.671 --> 01:04:03.051
I have something that belongs to you,
from a long time ago.

01:04:05.095 --> 01:04:09.391
It's my camera.
How did you get it?

01:04:11.602 --> 01:04:15.522
Nurse Hanna...
I'm Toby.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.531
Toby...

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:33.415
I used to read to him
when he was a little boy.

01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:36.626
Oh, your arm, it healed.

01:04:37.628 --> 01:04:39.879
Look at you...

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:42.132
So young.

01:04:44.635 --> 01:04:48.263
Hey, stop it!
Ralph! Rex! Both of you, stop!

01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:52.517
My sister breeds them.
It's become a family business.

01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:59.525
-Actually, because of you.
-Me?

01:04:59.566 --> 01:05:01.318
Yes.

01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:04.571
You remember when you took
that lost dog home,

01:05:04.613 --> 01:05:09.034
and the owner was so grateful, that
she came to the hospital to thank you.

01:05:09.076 --> 01:05:12.663
Oh.
Oh, but I was here, I was gone.

01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:15.499
And someone told them if they really
wanted to return the favor,

01:05:15.541 --> 01:05:18.800
they should come and read to me.

01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.338
Oh, well, that was Julia or Dottie.

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:27.052
Yes, because I was your favorite boy
in the hospital. You were.

01:05:28.512 --> 01:05:32.182
And then, they mentioned
that you were hoping

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:34.268
I wouldn't have to spend
Christmas alone.

01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:38.438
Oh, it was definitely Dottie.
Yeah.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.360
So they took me home.
Oh, wonderful.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.113
Oh, yes, I remember
they had a little child.

01:05:46.154 --> 01:05:49.950
-Clara, my sister.
-Your sister?

01:05:51.493 --> 01:05:53.995
They adopted me.

01:05:58.584 --> 01:06:00.377
And Sue, my adopted mother,

01:06:00.377 --> 01:06:02.588
realized how important
Ruffin was to the family,

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:04.672
so she started a kennel.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:08.510
That's why I keep seeing
so many golden retrievers here now.

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:10.554
Yeah, they're service dogs.

01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:13.472
They've been helping
a lot of people over the years.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.435
These two were drop-outs.

01:06:16.476 --> 01:06:20.479
They're too silly to be
service dogs, so they're mine.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:29.200
Oh...
Darn, I'm out of film.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:32.534
Film...
What?

01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:38.749
Almost no one shoots film anymore.
It's all digital. It's what?

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:42.753
That's all right, I know someone
who can develop that for you. Oh.

01:06:43.754 --> 01:06:46.590
And Dottie?
How did her life turn out?

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:52.387
Dottie... She's still here.
Would you like to see her?

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:57.100
Yes! Yes, please! Dottie's here?
She's here.

01:07:03.398 --> 01:07:08.320
I heard she was quite the character
once. That's Dottie.

01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:15.202
But since I've worked here,
well, she doesn't talk a lot.

01:07:15.244 --> 01:07:18.788
I'm not sure how much she remembers.

01:07:33.679 --> 01:07:36.000
Hi, Dottie.

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:42.437
-Nurse Hanna is here to see you.
-Nurse Hanna?

01:07:55.576 --> 01:07:59.705
Dottie...
Look at you.

01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:06.170
-Can she hear?
-She doesn't respond to much anymore.

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:16.721
Dottie...
It's me, Hanna.

01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:22.000
Dottie?

01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:31.694
Yes, it's me.

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:37.326
She...
She's trying to say something.

01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:43.415
-C-Com-Eh...
-What?

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:46.877
"Comment" on-on what?
Hanna.

01:08:46.919 --> 01:08:49.295
You should see this.

01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:01.000
When we moved her into this unit,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.268
that's the only personal thing
she brought with her.

01:09:04.937 --> 01:09:07.500
Must be her prized possession.

01:09:07.772 --> 01:09:10.359
Well, it's addressed to Dottie.
It's from me?

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.403
"Darling Dottie,
I'm finally in my place

01:09:13.444 --> 01:09:15.572
"in the big city, address below.

01:09:15.572 --> 01:09:18.242
Can't write more
because it's blazing hot..."

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:21.870
Well, that doesn't make sense.
I never lived in a big city.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.747
Keep reading.

01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:27.334
"...P.S. We made it in time
for our third year of bliss.

01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:33.841
Yours, Hanna."
Dated... August 16th, 1946.

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:36.899
Well, that's our anniversary.

01:09:39.304 --> 01:09:41.800
Chet made it home.

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:46.270
They said that he was lost in
the war, but he.. He made it home.

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.731
That's why his name wasn't on
the memorial. Chet didn't die.

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:53.777
Hanna... This means that you get
to go home, too.

01:09:56.822 --> 01:10:01.660
-But... But how?
-She didn't say "comment".

01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:07.206
She said "comet".

01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:18.260
Oh, the De Vico comet.

01:10:18.302 --> 01:10:21.305
That's the comet
everyone was talking about,

01:10:21.305 --> 01:10:24.808
and you said that people were
calling it "The Christmas comet",

01:10:24.808 --> 01:10:28.312
but that wasn't its real name.
Remember? It was just a week ago.

01:10:29.438 --> 01:10:35.402
-A week ago for you, 70 years for me.
-Well, 71, to be exact.

01:10:36.945 --> 01:10:38.864
Here we go.

01:10:38.906 --> 01:10:42.951
"The De Vico is a comet with
an orbital period of 71 years."

01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:47.873
"It was discovered by Francesco
De Vico in 1874, on December 22nd."

01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:52.586
Today.
Yeah.

01:10:52.628 --> 01:10:54.755
What does that mean?
Uh...

01:10:57.341 --> 01:11:01.677
Let me try to make some sense of this.

01:11:04.348 --> 01:11:08.769
The last day in the hospital,
I overheard the nurses talking.

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.521
Dottie was beside herself.

01:11:10.521 --> 01:11:14.358
They found your car in the snow,
you were gone, vanished.

01:11:14.358 --> 01:11:18.862
Someone mentioned the coincidence
of a comet the night before.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:24.000
I was a boy, alone, I had
a wild imagination, and...

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:28.539
I had a belief
in the magic of miracles.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:33.418
Yeah, you wondered if the comet
was a miracle. Well, think about it!

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:38.966
A comet that only comes
every seven decades? At Christmas?

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:42.677
On the night you disappear?
And now you're here.

01:11:44.054 --> 01:11:47.000
But why?
Why me..

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:55.691
-It's to show you. To show all of us.
-To show us what?

01:11:58.026 --> 01:12:02.906
This! The dogs!
For this house! For you being here!

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:07.911
For me! For Jake!
Don't you see what you've done, Hanna?

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:10.706
And you didn't even know
you were doing it.

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:17.462
"The smallest stone
makes a ripple in the water."

01:12:17.504 --> 01:12:22.634
That's what Dottie said. I was feeling
so lost, like I had no purpose.

01:12:22.676 --> 01:12:24.800
But you do.

01:12:26.013 --> 01:12:30.475
The rain... The comet...
Christmas?

01:12:30.517 --> 01:12:36.940
-Do you believe in miracles?
-I think I do.

01:12:36.982 --> 01:12:42.000
Then believe, tonight, the Christmas
comet is going to take you back home.

01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:56.877
I need to retrace my steps exactly.

01:12:56.919 --> 01:12:59.087
I'll have to change my clothes
back into what I was wearing,

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:02.800
and.. Oh, I'm afraid I'm going
to forget something.

01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:09.640
I'm going to miss you all so much.
I don't know what's going to happen.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.476
Will it work?
Will I get back?

01:13:12.476 --> 01:13:15.300
I don't know, but I'm going to try.

01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:21.692
Because... My life isn't this one.
I don't belong here.

01:13:30.827 --> 01:13:33.000
So, the Christmas comet
will get her home?

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.500
There is something...
So magical about that.

01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:39.711
Seems a little...
¶ Woo!

01:13:39.753 --> 01:13:42.798
To me, but, hey, what do I know?

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:46.926
Are we going to see the comet tonight?
Please, please, please, please..

01:13:46.968 --> 01:13:50.097
Okay, that's enough. Please!
Yes.

01:13:53.684 --> 01:13:57.104
Here.
What if it doesn't work?

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:03.819
You said that you believed
in miracles. I do, but..

01:14:03.861 --> 01:14:06.863
And Mr. Cook said that
you have to believe in something

01:14:06.904 --> 01:14:08.700
before it can become something.

01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:11.000
Of course you do. He's right.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.914
Otherwise.. There is no otherwise.
It's gonna work.

01:14:17.624 --> 01:14:20.543
'cause it's a Christmas miracle!

01:14:20.544 --> 01:14:22.753
You ready?

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:25.715
Don't make me say goodbye.

01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:46.570
Wait, Hanna... Don't say anything.
I wasn't crying when I left.

01:14:50.157 --> 01:14:55.746
I met my husband when I was 6.
He used to pull my pigtails.

01:14:55.746 --> 01:15:00.167
And I... I thought
he was such a nuisance.

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:05.756
Turns out I was the last to realize
that he was the love of my life.

01:15:05.797 --> 01:15:09.760
Just like you and Sarah.
Sarah?

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.550
What was it, pigtail pulling?
Or did you hide her books?

01:15:17.726 --> 01:15:23.315
I used to put snow down her jacket.
Of course, she did much worse to me.

01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:26.692
She's still a brat, though.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:31.000
And you wouldn't know
what to do without her.

01:15:32.282 --> 01:15:35.800
You just haven't realized it yet,
but you will.

01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:41.249
You two look at each other
the same way Chet and I did.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:50.801
-It's time.
-I know.

01:15:53.804 --> 01:15:59.309
Chet's a lucky man.
Sarah's a lucky woman.

01:16:02.855 --> 01:16:08.652
Hanna...
If this works, and you get back...

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:13.907
You think...
You'll remember all of this?

01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:24.168
I don't know.
Who can predict a miracle?

01:16:50.819 --> 01:16:53.400
Hello, my daughter!

01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:57.800
I got you, buddy.

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:05.209
What do you say, a little candle for
my Christmas honey? All right, okay.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.214
Hey, mama. When's it here?
My neck is gonna fall off!!

01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:15.010
It's not for a while, silly. We're
gonna watch the gazebo lights go on.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:36.800
What?

01:17:49.044 --> 01:17:52.005
Well, it's about time.
Mm-hmm.

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:59.847
Have you lost it? No, actually,
I, uh... I think I found it.

01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:05.800
Come on.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.856
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

01:18:14.236 --> 01:18:18.407
Okay, everybody!
Here we go!

01:18:18.448 --> 01:18:23.287
Ten, nine, eight, seven...
It looks great.

01:18:23.287 --> 01:18:28.200
Six, five,
four, three, two, one!

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:34.297
It's wonderful.

01:18:35.299 --> 01:18:38.000
Oh, come on.

01:18:52.858 --> 01:18:57.821
¶ Silent night

01:18:57.821 --> 01:19:00.157
¶ Holy night

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:03.952
¶ Shepherd's quake

01:19:03.952 --> 01:19:07.039
¶ At the sight

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:13.420
¶ Glories stream from Heaven afar

01:19:13.462 --> 01:19:20.000
¶ Heavenly hosts sing "Hallelujah"

01:19:21.178 --> 01:19:27.809
¶ Christ the savior is born

01:19:27.851 --> 01:19:33.482
¶ Christ, the savior is born

01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:36.151
Look!

01:19:38.237 --> 01:19:40.863
It's here!

01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:29.997
-I'm scared, mommy.
-Don't be, my love.

01:20:36.253 --> 01:20:38.212
Hanna?

01:20:40.424 --> 01:20:42.967
He's here.

01:21:05.574 --> 01:21:08.000
She's gone home.

01:21:18.086 --> 01:21:20.800
She's home!

01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:23.382
Yes!

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:34.900
What the...

01:21:39.233 --> 01:21:42.610
One more thing.

01:21:43.278 --> 01:21:47.407
Photos...
From Hanna's camera.

01:21:57.084 --> 01:22:00.712
Look at this little boy.
That's me.

01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:02.506
Yeah!

01:22:03.507 --> 01:22:08.053
Wait, that's the star we put
on top of the gazebo!

01:22:09.388 --> 01:22:11.300
Mom...

01:22:11.557 --> 01:22:15.185
Look.
That's grams and pops.

01:22:17.271 --> 01:22:23.026
It is. Well, I'll be.
I knew they met in a hospital.

01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:26.655
Mom was a nurse, and it was
just after the war...

01:22:26.697 --> 01:22:29.366
Hanna introduced them.

01:22:29.408 --> 01:22:34.997
She thought that'd be a nice thing
to do. It was.

01:22:36.456 --> 01:22:40.501
If she hadn't done
that one little thing, then...

01:22:41.253 --> 01:22:44.000
None of us would be here.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.636
Look, sweetheart, there's your
great grandmother,

01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:52.513
and your great grandfather.

01:22:52.514 --> 01:22:56.059
-That's cool.
-Yes, it is.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:16.000
Why not just call
your husband to help you?
